1
00:00:15,908 --> 00:00:18,494
Broke in right
on the two of them. 

2
00:00:18,577 --> 00:00:21,789
No matter what they say,
it's all about money.

3
00:00:21,872 --> 00:00:25,209
So let's imagine, ladies, that you're
a Savings and Loan officer. Watch.

4
00:00:25,251 --> 00:00:28,170
One, two, three. See?

5
00:00:28,254 --> 00:00:30,381
You've got it all,
and we've got nothin'.

6
00:00:30,422 --> 00:00:32,424
- And you have all four. Take a look.
- Oh!

7
00:00:32,508 --> 00:00:34,426
But I wouldn't trust you
with real gold.

8
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:37,054
- That's why this one's only worth about a penny.
- Hmm.

9
00:00:37,138 --> 00:00:39,765
And if you wonder where
the other one went, watch.

10
00:00:39,849 --> 00:00:42,143
A penny from the ear.
How much for the rest?

11
00:00:42,226 --> 00:00:44,645
- Have you seen Edward?
- No, I haven't. Great party, Philip.

12
00:00:44,728 --> 00:00:47,231
My wife went to a lot of trouble;
she called a caterer.

13
00:00:47,314 --> 00:00:49,442
- Excuse me, Ann. Howard, how are you?
- Philip, good.

14
00:00:49,525 --> 00:00:51,527
Hey, I understand Edward's
taking over Morse Industries.

15
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:53,779
- Yeah, well, he's not here to get a suntan.
- Can I get in on it?

16
00:00:53,863 --> 00:00:55,781
- Yeah. Call me.
- When?

17
00:00:55,865 --> 00:00:57,783
Just call me.

18
00:00:57,867 --> 00:01:00,703
- Uh, hi. I'm Philip Stuckey, Edward Lewis's lawyer.
- Where's the guest of honor?

19
00:01:00,786 --> 00:01:03,414
He's probably off in a corner
somewhere charming a very pretty lady.

20
00:01:03,497 --> 00:01:05,291
How are you?

21
00:01:05,374 --> 00:01:08,919
I told my secretary to make the
arrangements. Didn't she call you?

22
00:01:08,961 --> 00:01:12,923
Yes, she did. I speak to
your secretary more than I speak to you.

23
00:01:12,965 --> 00:01:15,801
- I see.
- I have my own life too, you know, Edward.

24
00:01:15,885 --> 00:01:18,804
This is a very important week
for me. I need you here.

25
00:01:18,846 --> 00:01:23,142
But you never give me any notice. You
just think I'm at your beck and call.

26
00:01:23,225 --> 00:01:26,270
I do not believe that you
are at my beck and call.

27
00:01:26,312 --> 00:01:28,314
Well, that's the way
you always make me feel.

28
00:01:28,355 --> 00:01:31,066
- Maybe I should just move out.
- If that's what you want, yes.

29
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:33,110
All right, when you get back
to New York, we'll discuss it.

30
00:01:33,194 --> 00:01:35,696
- Now is as good a time as any.
- That's fine with me, Edward. Good-bye.

31
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:37,698
Good-bye, Jessica.

32
00:01:43,496 --> 00:01:46,248
- Phil suggested that maybe I should
take a I- - Phil is just my lawyer, okay?

33
00:01:46,332 --> 00:01:49,210
- Yes, sir.
- How did the Morse stock open at the Nikkei?

34
00:01:49,293 --> 00:01:52,671
- I don't know.
- You don't know? Tokyo opened maybe 90 minutes ago.

35
00:01:52,755 --> 00:01:54,673
- You have to keep on top of these things, all right?
- Done.

36
00:01:54,757 --> 00:01:56,717
- Hello, Mr. Lewis.
- Hi. How you doin'? I want this whole thing...

37
00:01:56,801 --> 00:01:59,178
wrapped up as soon as possible;
I gotta get to New York by Sunday.

38
00:01:59,261 --> 00:02:01,138
- I got tickets to the Met.
- Yes, sir.

39
00:02:02,598 --> 00:02:04,517
- Your coat, Mr. Lewis.
- Thank you.

40
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,186
- Edward!
- Susan!

41
00:02:07,269 --> 00:02:09,188
- Hi.
- Hi.

42
00:02:09,271 --> 00:02:12,108
- I was sorry to hear about Carter.
- Oh, yeah. Thanks.

43
00:02:12,191 --> 00:02:16,529
- Heard you got married.
- Well... yeah. I couldn't wait for you!

44
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:19,281
Mmm. Susan, tell me something.

45
00:02:19,365 --> 00:02:22,827
- Yes?
- When you and I were dating,

46
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:26,038
did you speak to my secretary
more than you spoke to me?

47
00:02:26,122 --> 00:02:28,707
She was one of my bridesmaids.

48
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:33,170
Hmm. Your husband's
a very lucky guy.

49
00:02:33,212 --> 00:02:35,589
- Bye.
- Thanks, bye.

50
00:02:35,673 --> 00:02:37,591
- Do you?
- Absolutely.

51
00:02:37,675 --> 00:02:39,885
- Wonderful.
- He's leaving. Edward's leaving.

52
00:02:39,969 --> 00:02:42,930
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

53
00:02:43,013 --> 00:02:46,100
Is this Mr. Stuckey's car?

54
00:02:46,183 --> 00:02:48,144
Edward,
where you goin'?

55
00:02:48,227 --> 00:02:51,272
- You got the keys to your car?
- Why, what's wrong with the limo?

56
00:02:51,355 --> 00:02:54,024
Look, the limo is buried back
there. Darryl can't get it out.

57
00:02:54,108 --> 00:02:56,068
- Mmm. - Please give me
the keys. - All right, look.

58
00:02:56,152 --> 00:02:58,529
I don't think you should drive. You're
a little excited. Don't drive my car.

59
00:02:58,571 --> 00:03:01,198
Let me work something out here. Fellas,
what kind of a system is this?

60
00:03:01,282 --> 00:03:03,367
Can you move these cars out
of here? Look, Edward.

61
00:03:03,409 --> 00:03:06,412
- Edward. Uh, are you familiar with a stick shift?
- Uh, yeah.

62
00:03:06,454 --> 00:03:08,414
- Have you driven a shift? Listen, all right.
- Yeah. Yeah.

63
00:03:08,497 --> 00:03:10,749
Just be ginger with it. It's a new car.

64
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:12,751
- Don't, uh- Just don't-
- Okay. I can do it.

65
00:03:12,793 --> 00:03:14,753
Edward! Give me a break, please!

66
00:03:14,837 --> 00:03:17,715
- I love this car.
- I love it too. Look, you don't even know where you're going.

67
00:03:17,756 --> 00:03:19,884
You're gonna get lost in the dark!

68
00:03:19,967 --> 00:03:24,096
Beverly Hills is down the hill!

69
00:03:26,724 --> 00:03:29,894
I don't need
to fall at your feet

70
00:03:29,977 --> 00:03:33,564
Just 'cause you cut me
to the bone

71
00:03:35,316 --> 00:03:38,903
- And I won't miss
the way that you kiss me

72
00:03:38,944 --> 00:03:44,366
- Oh, shit.
- We were never carved in stone

73
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:49,079
If I don't listen
to the talk of the town

74
00:03:49,163 --> 00:03:53,083
Then maybe I can fool myself

75
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:57,129
I'll get over you
I know I will

76
00:03:57,213 --> 00:04:01,091
I'll pretend my ship's
not sinking

77
00:04:01,133 --> 00:04:05,888
And I'll tell myself
I'm over you

78
00:04:05,971 --> 00:04:09,517
- 'Cause I'm the king of wishful thinking
- Maps here. Maps.

79
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,853
Have a good one.

80
00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:18,275
What do you say, blondie?
- Hi, honey, want some fun?

81
00:04:20,569 --> 00:04:23,322
- Hey, baby, you lookin' for a date?
- Yeah, honey, we're lookin'.

82
00:04:23,405 --> 00:04:27,118
- Here I am.
- I'm Al and this is my friend Bill. Get in the car.

83
00:04:59,233 --> 00:05:02,528
Well, I'm just goin' to school
like I'm real, real cool

84
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:05,156
Gotta dance like a fool
Got the message

85
00:05:05,239 --> 00:05:09,034
And I gotta be a wild one
Ooh, yeah

86
00:05:09,118 --> 00:05:12,037
I'm a wild one

87
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:15,583
Gonna break the news
Gonna keep on moving wild

88
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:18,878
Gonna keep on swingin', baby
I'm a real wild child

89
00:05:24,258 --> 00:05:27,553
Now, wait a minute.
You don't seem to understand me.

90
00:05:27,595 --> 00:05:31,599
That's my job. At the end of the month,
I collect everybody's rent.

91
00:05:31,682 --> 00:05:35,352
Now give me the money,
or you're outta here.

92
00:05:37,897 --> 00:05:40,900
Gonna meet all my friends
Gonna have myself a ball

93
00:05:40,941 --> 00:05:44,028
Gonna tell my friends
Gonna tell them all

94
00:05:44,111 --> 00:05:46,405
That I'm a wild one

95
00:05:46,489 --> 00:05:49,283
Ooh, yeah
I'm a wild one

96
00:05:50,785 --> 00:05:53,704
Gonna break the news
Gonna keep on moving wild

97
00:05:53,746 --> 00:05:58,083
Gonna keep on swinging, baby
I'm a real wild child

98
00:06:15,768 --> 00:06:19,355
I'm a real wild one
and I like wild fun

99
00:06:19,438 --> 00:06:22,566
In a world going crazy
everything seems hazy

100
00:06:22,608 --> 00:06:27,196
I'm a wild one
Ooh, yeah, I'm a wild one

101
00:06:29,031 --> 00:06:31,826
Gonna break the news
Gonna keep on moving wild

102
00:06:31,909 --> 00:06:36,122
Gonna keep on swinging, baby
I'm a real wild child

103
00:06:36,205 --> 00:06:38,749
Welcome to Hollywood!

104
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:40,918
Everybody comes to Hollywood
got a dream.

105
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:44,213
What's your dream?
What's your dream?

106
00:06:44,296 --> 00:06:47,591
Hey, mister?
Hey, what's your dream?

107
00:06:47,633 --> 00:06:49,593
Have a good one.

108
00:06:51,971 --> 00:06:55,850
- What happened?
- Some chick. She bought it over there.

109
00:06:55,975 --> 00:06:58,769
Detective Albertson. What do
you know about that girl?

110
00:06:58,853 --> 00:07:01,021
I tell you, man. I don't
know who she hang with.

111
00:07:01,105 --> 00:07:04,191
C'mon, guy. We just pulled her out of a
Dumpster in the back. Who was her pimp?

112
00:07:04,233 --> 00:07:06,444
Cocaine her pimp. She a strawberry.

113
00:07:06,527 --> 00:07:11,282
She be out on these streets day in, day
out, tradin' her sorry self for some crack.

114
00:07:11,365 --> 00:07:13,784
- And what do you do?
- I cool.

115
00:07:13,868 --> 00:07:16,954
Oh, I'll bet.
Hey, hey, hey! Excuse me! Excuse me!

116
00:07:17,037 --> 00:07:19,707
- What are you, from the press?
- No, no. We're from Orlando.

117
00:07:19,748 --> 00:07:22,918
Oh, I don't believe this. Do you- I
got tourists photographing the body, Al.

118
00:07:23,002 --> 00:07:25,713
What happened?

119
00:07:37,725 --> 00:07:39,727
In a world that can be
so insane

120
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:44,398
I don't think it's very strange for me
to be in love with you

121
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:48,861
I wanna know more
than your brain

122
00:07:48,944 --> 00:07:50,863
Hey, Pops, has Kit
been in here?

123
00:07:50,946 --> 00:07:53,991
Upstairs in the poolroom.

124
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:58,245
Now I smile for your affection
We have made a soul connection

125
00:07:58,329 --> 00:08:00,289
Just for whom
does your bell toll

126
00:08:00,331 --> 00:08:03,250
Don't be cruel
Show me your soul

127
00:08:03,292 --> 00:08:05,252
Yo, Viv!

128
00:08:05,294 --> 00:08:08,339
- Is it all gone?
- Carlos, you know my roommate, Vivian.

129
00:08:08,422 --> 00:08:11,967
- This is Angel. That's the Dude.
- I know everybody! Is it all gone, Kit?

130
00:08:12,051 --> 00:08:15,346
Carlos sold me some great shit. We just
had this party. I was the hostess.

131
00:08:15,429 --> 00:08:18,808
I can't believe you bought drugs with
our rent. What is goin' on with you, Kit?

132
00:08:18,849 --> 00:08:21,352
I needed a little pick-me-up.

133
00:08:21,435 --> 00:08:23,437
- Well, we need rent money!
- Oh, calm down, chica.

134
00:08:23,521 --> 00:08:25,481
- She only owes me 200 more.
- Carlos!

135
00:08:25,564 --> 00:08:27,858
- Another $200?
- That was from way before.

136
00:08:27,942 --> 00:08:31,445
That's right, 200, Vivian. But if
you wanna work off her money with me,

137
00:08:31,529 --> 00:08:35,616
- we can work something out.
- That's a very sweet offer, Carlos, but not now.

138
00:08:35,699 --> 00:08:37,660
- Come on, Viv. Come downstairs.
- Work out- Work out what?

139
00:08:37,701 --> 00:08:41,122
- What are we gonna work out?
- You really like her, Carlos?

140
00:08:41,163 --> 00:08:43,165
You took it
while I was sleeping?

141
00:08:43,207 --> 00:08:45,584
- You were unavailable for consultation.
- Hey, let's go.

142
00:08:45,668 --> 00:08:48,712
Snack! Snack!

143
00:08:48,796 --> 00:08:52,383
- Besides, it's my apartment.
- Yeah, well, I have to live there too, Kit.

144
00:08:52,466 --> 00:08:55,469
Look, you came here; I gave you some
money; I gave you a place to stay...

145
00:08:55,511 --> 00:08:57,805
and some valuable
vocational advice.

146
00:08:57,847 --> 00:08:59,807
He was on my case.
I had to give him something.

147
00:08:59,849 --> 00:09:01,976
So don't irritate me.

148
00:09:02,017 --> 00:09:05,312
- This ain't a buffet, Kit.
- Irritate you?

149
00:09:05,354 --> 00:09:09,316
Irritate you? I just saw a girl
pulled out of a Dumpster.

150
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:13,654
I know. Skinny Marie.
But... she was a- a flake.

151
00:09:13,696 --> 00:09:16,824
She was a crack head. Dominic was trying
to straighten her out for months.

152
00:09:16,866 --> 00:09:20,494
Leave her alone!

153
00:09:20,578 --> 00:09:22,538
Don't you want
to get outta here?

154
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:26,667
Get outta where?
Where the fuck you wanna go?

155
00:09:26,709 --> 00:09:29,170
Aah, nothin' but garbage.

156
00:09:29,211 --> 00:09:31,922
- Uh, excuse me.
- Huh?

157
00:09:32,006 --> 00:09:34,925
- Can you tell me how to get to Beverly Hills?
- You're here!

158
00:09:35,009 --> 00:09:38,179
That's Sylvester Stallone's
house right there.

159
00:09:38,262 --> 00:09:41,098
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

160
00:09:42,224 --> 00:09:45,186
- Hey, yo, Rachel.
- What?

161
00:09:45,269 --> 00:09:48,731
- Yeah. You see the stars on the sidewalk, babe?
- Yeah.

162
00:09:48,773 --> 00:09:52,151
Well, Vivian and me, we work Bob Hope,
we work the Ritz Brothers,

163
00:09:52,234 --> 00:09:55,571
we work Fred Astaire, we work all
the way down to Ella Fitzgerald.

164
00:09:55,613 --> 00:09:59,074
This is our turf. We got seniority.
You better get off our corner.

165
00:09:59,158 --> 00:10:02,411
Forgive me. I was just takin'
a rest here. Besides, she's new.

166
00:10:02,495 --> 00:10:06,749
Yeah. Well, I'm old, so go rest up
by Monty Hall or Esther Wilson.

167
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:08,959
- Williams.
- Esther Williams! Where you belong!

168
00:10:09,043 --> 00:10:12,630
Back off, Kit. You know,
you're really becoming a grouch.

169
00:10:12,713 --> 00:10:15,925
- Am I really a grouch?
- Yes.

170
00:10:15,966 --> 00:10:17,927
Sometimes.

171
00:10:17,968 --> 00:10:21,263
Well, just 'cause I'm hungry.
I'm gonna go get something to eat.

172
00:10:21,305 --> 00:10:24,642
- Hey, girls.
- Hey, yo, baby!

173
00:10:24,725 --> 00:10:26,727
How about a freebie?
It's my birthday.

174
00:10:26,811 --> 00:10:28,771
Dream on!

175
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:33,067
It's lookin'
really slow tonight.

176
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:38,823
Yeah, well... maybe we should get a
pimp, you know. Carlos really digs you.

177
00:10:38,906 --> 00:10:41,951
And then he'll run our lives
and take our money. No.

178
00:10:42,034 --> 00:10:45,579
You're right. We say who,
we say when, we say how much.

179
00:10:47,957 --> 00:10:50,960
- Do you think I look like Carol Channing?
- No! I love this look.

180
00:10:51,043 --> 00:10:54,755
It's very glamorous. Glamour choice.

181
00:10:54,797 --> 00:10:56,757
Oh, yo, oh, yo.
Catch this!

182
00:10:59,343 --> 00:11:01,512
Wait a minute.
That's a Lotus Esprit.

183
00:11:03,597 --> 00:11:07,435
No, that's rent. You should go for him.
You look hot tonight.

184
00:11:07,476 --> 00:11:11,147
Don't take less than a hundred. Call me
when you're through. Take care of you.

185
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:14,275
Take care of you.

186
00:11:16,318 --> 00:11:19,780
Work it. Work it, baby.
Work it!

187
00:11:19,822 --> 00:11:22,450
Work it. Own it.

188
00:11:23,492 --> 00:11:25,619
Yes, you can handle this.

189
00:11:25,703 --> 00:11:28,789
First is here somewhere.

190
00:11:28,873 --> 00:11:31,625
Hey, sugar, you lookin'
for a date?

191
00:11:31,667 --> 00:11:34,295
No, I wanna find Beverly Hills.
Can you give me directions?

192
00:11:34,336 --> 00:11:36,964
Sure. For five bucks.

193
00:11:37,047 --> 00:11:40,634
- Ridiculous.
- Price just went up to ten.

194
00:11:41,719 --> 00:11:43,679
You can't charge me
for directions.

195
00:11:43,721 --> 00:11:46,390
I can do anything I want to,
baby. I ain't lost.

196
00:11:51,395 --> 00:11:53,355
All right, okay?

197
00:11:53,397 --> 00:11:56,692
All right. You win, I lose.
Got change for a 20?

198
00:11:56,776 --> 00:12:00,488
For 20, I'll show you personal.
Even show you where the stars live.

199
00:12:00,571 --> 00:12:05,993
- Oh, that's all right. I already been to Stallone's.
- Right. Uh, down the street.

200
00:12:07,578 --> 00:12:11,540
Lights! Lights would be good here.

201
00:12:12,695 --> 00:12:14,695
It's a little, a little temperamental.

202
00:12:16,796 --> 00:12:19,088
Yours?
No,it isn't

203
00:12:19,089 --> 00:12:19,839
Stolen?

204
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,049
Not Exactly

205
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:23,968
What's your name?

206
00:12:23,969 --> 00:12:27,263
What do you want it to be?

207
00:12:27,681 --> 00:12:32,811
- Vivian. My name is Vivian.
- Vivian.

208
00:12:33,521 --> 00:12:36,773
- So, what hotel you stayin' at?
- The, uh, Regent Beverly Wilshire.

209
00:12:36,774 --> 00:12:39,400
Down the block,
right at the corner.

210
00:12:45,074 --> 00:12:49,452
Man, this baby must corner
like it's on rails!

211
00:12:49,453 --> 00:12:51,454
I beg your pardon?

212
00:12:51,455 --> 00:12:54,457
Well, doesn't it blow your mind?
This is only four cylinders.

213
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:57,877
- You know about cars.
Where did that come from?

214
00:12:57,878 --> 00:13:00,588
Road and Track. The boys
back home I grew up with,

215
00:13:00,589 --> 00:13:03,591
they were really into American
heavy metal: Mustangs, Corvettes.

216
00:13:03,592 --> 00:13:06,428
- Ah.
- They bought 'em cheap and fixed 'em up. I paid attention.

217
00:13:06,429 --> 00:13:09,097
So how is it you know
so little about cars?

218
00:13:09,098 --> 00:13:12,267
My first car
was a limousine.

219
00:13:12,268 --> 00:13:14,727
- Oh.
- So where is this...

220
00:13:14,728 --> 00:13:18,773
heavy metal... home?

221
00:13:18,774 --> 00:13:21,609
Millage Ville, Georgia.

222
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:23,778
You know, I think you left
your transmission back there.

223
00:13:23,779 --> 00:13:26,448
- You're not shifting right.
This is a standard "H."

224
00:13:26,449 --> 00:13:28,950
Standard "H." Like I know
what that means.

225
00:13:28,951 --> 00:13:33,288
Have you ever driven a Lotus?

226
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:35,957
- No.
- You're gonna start right now.

227
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:41,254
- You're joking.
- No. It's the only way I can get you off my coat.

228
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:47,635
Fasten your seat belts. I am taking you
for the ride of your life.

229
00:13:47,636 --> 00:13:50,805
- I'm gonna show you what this car can really do. Are you ready?
- I am ready.

230
00:13:50,806 --> 00:13:54,476
- Hang on. -
Okay. - Here we go.

231
00:13:58,814 --> 00:14:02,525
This has pedals like a race car.
They're really close together.

232
00:14:02,526 --> 00:14:07,489
So it's probably easier for a woman to
drive, 'cause they have little feet.

233
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:09,491
Except me.
I wear a size nine.

234
00:14:09,492 --> 00:14:13,161
You know your foot's as big as
your arm from your elbow to your wrist?

235
00:14:13,162 --> 00:14:15,163
Did you know that?

236
00:14:15,164 --> 00:14:19,834
- No, I didn't know that.
- It's a little bit of trivia.

237
00:14:22,171 --> 00:14:26,800
Tell me, what kind of- what kind of
money you girls make these days?

238
00:14:26,801 --> 00:14:28,802
Ballpark.

239
00:14:28,803 --> 00:14:31,638
Can't take less than $100.

240
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:35,141
- A hundred dollars a night.
- For an hour.

241
00:14:35,142 --> 00:14:37,185
An hour?

242
00:14:37,186 --> 00:14:40,855
You make $100 an hour and you got
a safety pin holding your boot up?

243
00:14:40,856 --> 00:14:42,857
You gotta be joking.

244
00:14:42,858 --> 00:14:46,986
- I never joke about money.
- Neither do I.

245
00:14:47,655 --> 00:14:49,989
Hundred dollars an hour.

246
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:52,909
Pretty stiff.

247
00:14:54,286 --> 00:14:59,290
Well, no.
But it's got potential.

248
00:15:16,308 --> 00:15:18,309
Good evening, Mr. Lewis.

249
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:20,478
Will you be needing the car
anymore tonight?

250
00:15:20,479 --> 00:15:25,024
I- I hope not!

251
00:15:25,401 --> 00:15:29,028
Ah. We're here.

252
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:31,948
Yeah.

253
00:15:34,118 --> 00:15:36,411
So you'll be all right?

254
00:15:36,412 --> 00:15:40,165
Yeah, I'm gonna grab a cab
with my twenty bucks.

255
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:44,586
- Go back to your office.
- Yeah.

256
00:15:44,587 --> 00:15:47,130
My office. Yeah.

257
00:15:47,131 --> 00:15:51,134
Well, thanks for the ride.

258
00:15:52,094 --> 00:15:55,054
- See you.
- Good-bye.

259
00:16:07,318 --> 00:16:10,278
No taxis?

260
00:16:11,071 --> 00:16:13,990
No, I like the bus.

261
00:16:16,619 --> 00:16:20,121
I was thinking-
Did you really say $100 an hour?

262
00:16:20,122 --> 00:16:23,041
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

263
00:16:23,834 --> 00:16:26,544
Well, if you don't have
any prior engagements,

264
00:16:26,545 --> 00:16:30,173
I'd be very pleased if you would
accompany me into the hotel.

265
00:16:30,174 --> 00:16:33,134
You got it.

266
00:16:34,095 --> 00:16:37,597
What is your name?

267
00:16:37,598 --> 00:16:41,267
- Edward.
- Edward. That's my favorite name in the whole world!

268
00:16:41,268 --> 00:16:44,229
- No!
- I tell you what, this is fate, Edward.

269
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:47,816
That's what this is.

270
00:16:47,817 --> 00:16:51,694
- Why don't you put this on?
- Why?

271
00:16:51,695 --> 00:16:56,699
Well, this hotel is not the kind of
establishment that rents rooms by the hour.

272
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:59,661
Ah.

273
00:17:03,332 --> 00:17:08,169
- Wow!
- It's all right.

274
00:17:10,548 --> 00:17:13,591
- Holy shit.
- You're gonna be fine.

275
00:17:13,592 --> 00:17:18,138
Come with me.
And stop fidgeting.

276
00:17:18,139 --> 00:17:21,099
- Good evening, Mr. Lewis.
- Hello. You have messages?

277
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:24,310
- Yes, we have several.
- Thank you.

278
00:17:28,023 --> 00:17:31,985
- Could you send up some champagne and strawberries, please?
- Of course.

279
00:17:31,986 --> 00:17:35,321
Room service
for Mr. Lewis, please.

280
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:47,709
Oh, honey.

281
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:52,589
You know what's happened?
I've got a runner in my pantyhose.

282
00:17:53,048 --> 00:17:55,425
I'm not wearing pantyhose.

283
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:04,142
Well, color me happy!
There's a sofa in here for two.

284
00:18:04,894 --> 00:18:09,147
- First time in an elevator.
- Ah.

285
00:18:09,148 --> 00:18:12,609
Close your mouth, dear.

286
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:17,071
Sorry, I couldn't help it.

287
00:18:17,072 --> 00:18:19,991
Try.

288
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,874
- Penthouse.
- The penthouse.

289
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:30,418
- Yes.
- Mmm.

290
00:18:30,419 --> 00:18:33,379
- To the left.
- Oh.

291
00:18:48,729 --> 00:18:52,941
Oh, I miss keys.

292
00:19:06,455 --> 00:19:08,957
Impressed?

293
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:11,459
You kidding me?
I come here all the time.

294
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:16,881
- As a matter of fact, they do rent this room by the hour.
- Sure they do.

295
00:19:17,591 --> 00:19:19,717
Wow, great view!

296
00:19:19,718 --> 00:19:23,930
- I bet you can see all the way to the ocean from out here.
- I'll take your word for it.

297
00:19:23,931 --> 00:19:27,267
- I don't go out there.
- Why don't you go out there?

298
00:19:27,268 --> 00:19:30,770
- I'm afraid of heights.
- You are?

299
00:19:30,771 --> 00:19:33,022
So how come you
rented the penthouse?

300
00:19:33,023 --> 00:19:36,985
It's the best. I looked all around
for penthouses on the first floor,

301
00:19:36,986 --> 00:19:39,946
but I can't find one.

302
00:19:40,781 --> 00:19:45,660
Well, now that you have me here,
what are you going to do with me?

303
00:19:45,661 --> 00:19:49,330
- Want to know something? I don't have a clue.
- No?

304
00:19:49,331 --> 00:19:51,666
I hadn't exactly planned this.

305
00:19:51,667 --> 00:19:54,461
Well, do you plan everything?

306
00:19:54,462 --> 00:19:58,339
- Always.
- Yeah. Me too.

307
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:01,801
I'm actually- No, I'm not a planner.
I wouldn't say I was a planner.

308
00:20:01,802 --> 00:20:05,847
I would say I was, um, a kind of
"fly by the seat of my pants" gal.

309
00:20:05,848 --> 00:20:10,977
You know, moment to moment.
That's me. That's- Yeah.

310
00:20:11,187 --> 00:20:15,607
Mm-hmm. You know,
you could pay me.

311
00:20:15,608 --> 00:20:17,692
That's one way
to maybe break the ice.

312
00:20:17,693 --> 00:20:22,447
Oh, yeah. I'm sorry.
Uh, I assume cash is acceptable.

313
00:20:22,448 --> 00:20:25,700
Cash works for me, yeah.

314
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:35,627
You're on my fax.

315
00:20:35,878 --> 00:20:40,173
Well, that's one I haven't
been on before.

316
00:20:41,342 --> 00:20:43,551
Cute. She's very cute. Thank you.

317
00:20:43,552 --> 00:20:46,054
All right. Here we go.

318
00:20:46,055 --> 00:20:48,848
Pick one. I got red,
I got green, I got yellow.

319
00:20:48,849 --> 00:20:52,060
I'm out of purple, but I do
have one gold circle coin left.

320
00:20:52,061 --> 00:20:56,231
The condom of champions. The one and only.
Nothing is gettin' through this sucker.

321
00:20:56,232 --> 00:20:59,067
- What d'you say? Hmm?
- A buffet of safety.

322
00:20:59,068 --> 00:21:02,487
I'm a safety girl.

323
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,700
- All right, let's get
one of these on you.

324
00:21:07,701 --> 00:21:10,578
No. I-

325
00:21:12,581 --> 00:21:15,083
Why don't we just talk
for a little bit, okay?

326
00:21:15,084 --> 00:21:20,672
Talk. Yeah... uh... okay.

327
00:21:21,298 --> 00:21:25,844
Edward, are you in town
on, uh, business or pleasure?

328
00:21:25,845 --> 00:21:29,055
- Business, I think.
- Business, you think.

329
00:21:29,056 --> 00:21:33,852
Well... let me guess.

330
00:21:33,853 --> 00:21:38,106
That would make you...
a lawyer.

331
00:21:38,107 --> 00:21:41,067
- A lawyer.
- Mm-hmm.

332
00:21:41,068 --> 00:21:44,696
- What makes you think I'm a lawyer?
- You've got that, um...

333
00:21:44,697 --> 00:21:47,365
sharp, useless look
about you.

334
00:21:47,366 --> 00:21:50,952
I bet you've known a lot of lawyers.

335
00:21:50,953 --> 00:21:53,621
I've known a lot
of everybody.

336
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:59,544
What is that?

337
00:21:59,545 --> 00:22:02,881
- Champagne.
- Oh! Well.

338
00:22:02,882 --> 00:22:06,384
Might as well
make myself useful.

339
00:22:06,385 --> 00:22:11,097
Take a load off.

340
00:22:14,393 --> 00:22:18,021
- Good evening.
- Hi.

341
00:22:19,023 --> 00:22:22,567
- Uh, where would you like it?
- Where would we like it?

342
00:22:22,568 --> 00:22:25,612
Uh, over by the bar.

343
00:22:32,161 --> 00:22:34,162
Excuse me!

344
00:22:34,163 --> 00:22:36,164
It'll be on your bill,
Mr. Lewis.

345
00:22:36,165 --> 00:22:39,083
Thank you.

346
00:22:40,377 --> 00:22:42,837
What are you lookin' at?

347
00:22:42,838 --> 00:22:48,218
- What is he lookin' at?
- Ah, yes. Here you go. Thank you very much.

348
00:22:48,219 --> 00:22:50,220
Thank you very much, sir.
Have a nice night.

349
00:22:50,221 --> 00:22:54,224
A tip. Wow.
I missed that one. Oh.

350
00:22:54,225 --> 00:22:56,267
- Stupid.
- Don't worry about it.

351
00:22:56,268 --> 00:22:58,394
- You mind if I take my boots off?
- Not at all.

352
00:22:58,395 --> 00:23:03,691
- So, do you have a wife? Girlfriend?
- I have both.

353
00:23:03,692 --> 00:23:07,570
Where are they? Shopping together?

354
00:23:07,571 --> 00:23:13,326
My ex-wife... is now in Long Island...
in my ex-home...

355
00:23:13,327 --> 00:23:16,955
with my ex-dog.

356
00:23:18,082 --> 00:23:23,628
There you go. My ex-girlfriend,
Jessica, is in New York...

357
00:23:23,629 --> 00:23:28,508
moving out of my apartment
even as we speak.

358
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:36,391
Why don't you try a strawberry?

359
00:23:36,392 --> 00:23:40,728
- Why?
- It brings out the flavor in the champagne.

360
00:23:40,729 --> 00:23:43,648
Oh, groovy.

361
00:23:50,406 --> 00:23:53,324
Pretty good.

362
00:23:55,244 --> 00:23:58,830
- Don't you drink?
- No.

363
00:24:01,417 --> 00:24:05,211
Listen, I- I appreciate this whole
seduction scene you've got goin',

364
00:24:05,212 --> 00:24:07,964
but let me give you a tip:
I'm a sure thing, okay?

365
00:24:07,965 --> 00:24:10,967
So, I'm on an hourly rate.
Could we just move it along?

366
00:24:10,968 --> 00:24:14,179
Somehow I'm sensing that this time
problem is a major issue with you.

367
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:16,181
Why don't we just
get through that right now?

368
00:24:16,182 --> 00:24:19,809
- Great, let's get started.
- How much for the entire night?

369
00:24:20,394 --> 00:24:23,980
Stay here?

370
00:24:23,981 --> 00:24:26,399
You couldn't afford it.

371
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,361
- Try me.
- $300.

372
00:24:30,362 --> 00:24:35,450
Done. Thank you.
Now we can relax.

373
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:47,170
I'll be out in just a minute.
That champagne kind of got to me.

374
00:24:47,171 --> 00:24:49,172
- I didn't hear you. What did you say?
- Uh...

375
00:24:49,173 --> 00:24:52,050
I said I'd be out
in just a minute.

376
00:24:52,051 --> 00:24:54,344
What is- What do you have
in, uh, your hand there?

377
00:24:54,345 --> 00:24:58,681
- What are you hiding?
- Nothing.

378
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:03,353
All right, look.
I do not want any drugs here.

379
00:25:03,354 --> 00:25:06,231
I don't want any of this. Get your
things and your money and please leave.

380
00:25:06,232 --> 00:25:08,441
I don't do drugs, all right?
I- I stopped doing drugs when I was 14.

381
00:25:08,442 --> 00:25:12,612
What is this?
What is this?

382
00:25:14,198 --> 00:25:17,200
- This is dental floss.
- Yeah? So?

383
00:25:17,201 --> 00:25:23,248
I had all those strawberry seeds.
And you shouldn't neglect your gums.

384
00:25:23,999 --> 00:25:26,459
I'm sorry.
Please continue.

385
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:29,379
Thank you.

386
00:25:34,301 --> 00:25:39,347
- Are you gonna watch?
- No, I'm going.

387
00:25:41,767 --> 00:25:44,602
Thank you.

388
00:25:44,603 --> 00:25:48,523
It's just that, uh,
very few people surprise me.

389
00:25:48,524 --> 00:25:53,194
Yeah, well, you're lucky.
Most of 'em shock the hell outta me.

390
00:25:56,657 --> 00:26:00,535
- You're watching.
- I'm going.

391
00:26:14,008 --> 00:26:16,926
Yes, that may be true, Vance.

392
00:26:16,927 --> 00:26:21,181
Yes, I know, but I still need
the numbers on Morse Industries.

393
00:26:21,182 --> 00:26:23,850
Uh-huh.
I've got 'em from London;

394
00:26:23,851 --> 00:26:26,019
I need 'em now from Tokyo.

395
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:29,689
I'll call down and get them when
I want them. Thank you very much.

396
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:35,278
I have a little carpet picnic here.
Are you sure you don't want a drink?

397
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:39,115
I'm high on life. Can't you tell?

398
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:52,754
You know, I never
saw this episode.

399
00:28:33,773 --> 00:28:36,649
What do you want?

400
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:38,777
What do you do?

401
00:28:38,778 --> 00:28:41,446
Everything.

402
00:28:41,447 --> 00:28:43,490
But I don't kiss on the mouth.

403
00:28:43,491 --> 00:28:47,118
Neither do I.

404
00:29:47,012 --> 00:29:49,264
- Hey, how you doing there?
- All right.

405
00:29:49,265 --> 00:29:51,641
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Good morning, Mr. Thompson.

406
00:29:51,642 --> 00:29:54,185
- Good morning, good morning.
- Good morning, sir.

407
00:29:54,186 --> 00:29:56,187
- Good morning, Mr. Thompson.
- Good morning, Marjorie.

408
00:29:56,188 --> 00:29:58,648
Of course Morse is going to fight.
It's to be expected.

409
00:29:58,649 --> 00:30:00,733
He's run his company
for a very long time now.

410
00:30:00,734 --> 00:30:03,570
I don't think he's ready to have
his name taken off the stationery.

411
00:30:03,571 --> 00:30:05,905
He wants to meet you
face to face.

412
00:30:05,906 --> 00:30:08,700
- I wouldn't do it.
- Sure, you wouldn't. But do it anyhow.

413
00:30:08,701 --> 00:30:10,702
Tonight. Dinner. Set it up.

414
00:30:10,703 --> 00:30:13,621
Oh, Edward, Edward. I- Look, it's
really not a good idea that you see him.

415
00:30:13,622 --> 00:30:16,916
Definitely not alone.
You know? He's a feisty old guy.

416
00:30:16,917 --> 00:30:19,627
You know, we say the wrong thing,
we could wind up in court.

417
00:30:19,628 --> 00:30:22,088
Well, you know, there's always a
possibility things are gonna go wrong.

418
00:30:22,089 --> 00:30:27,302
That's why I enjoy this so much.
Oh, by the way, Phil, about your car.

419
00:30:27,303 --> 00:30:31,055
- Oh, God. What?
- It corners like it's on rails.

420
00:30:31,056 --> 00:30:35,727
What? What does
that mean? Edward? Edward!

421
00:30:36,562 --> 00:30:38,772
Hi.

422
00:30:38,773 --> 00:30:41,274
Well, good morning.

423
00:30:41,275 --> 00:30:43,276
Red.

424
00:30:43,277 --> 00:30:46,154
Better.

425
00:30:48,073 --> 00:30:50,408
Y- You didn't wake me.
I can see you're really busy.

426
00:30:50,409 --> 00:30:53,828
- I'm gonna be outta here in just a minute.
- No, there's no hurry.

427
00:30:53,829 --> 00:30:55,830
Are you hungry?
You must be.

428
00:30:55,831 --> 00:30:59,918
Why don't you sit
and have something to eat?

429
00:31:00,461 --> 00:31:04,506
I, uh, took the liberty
of ordering everything on the menu.

430
00:31:04,507 --> 00:31:07,008
I didn't know what you'd like.

431
00:31:07,009 --> 00:31:10,261
- Thanks.
- All right? Good.

432
00:31:14,141 --> 00:31:16,935
- Did you sleep well?
- Yeah, too good.

433
00:31:16,936 --> 00:31:20,438
- I forgot where I was.
- Occupational hazard?

434
00:31:20,439 --> 00:31:24,526
Yeah. Did you sleep?

435
00:31:24,527 --> 00:31:28,905
Uh, yes, a little,
on the couch.

436
00:31:28,906 --> 00:31:30,949
I was, uh, working
last night.

437
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:33,409
You don't sleep,
you don't do drugs,

438
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:36,955
you don't drink,
you hardly eat.

439
00:31:36,956 --> 00:31:39,833
What do you do, Edward?
'Cause I know you're not a lawyer.

440
00:31:39,834 --> 00:31:42,418
That's right.

441
00:31:42,419 --> 00:31:45,630
There are four
other chairs here.

442
00:31:45,714 --> 00:31:48,633
Oh.

443
00:31:52,388 --> 00:31:55,807
- So what do you do?
- I buy companies.

444
00:31:55,808 --> 00:31:58,143
What kind of companies?

445
00:31:58,144 --> 00:32:02,981
Uh, I buy companies that are
in financial difficulty.

446
00:32:02,982 --> 00:32:05,483
If they have problems, you must
get 'em for a bargain, huh?

447
00:32:05,484 --> 00:32:08,319
Well, the company
I'm buying this week,

448
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:12,073
I'm getting for the bargain
price of about one billion.

449
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,077
- A billion dollars?
- Yes.

450
00:32:16,078 --> 00:32:18,746
Wow. You must be
really smart, huh?

451
00:32:21,208 --> 00:32:23,334
I only got through
the eleventh grade.

452
00:32:23,335 --> 00:32:27,172
How far did you go
in school?

453
00:32:27,173 --> 00:32:30,800
I went all the way.

454
00:32:32,511 --> 00:32:36,639
Your folks must be
really proud, huh?

455
00:32:42,521 --> 00:32:47,192
So you don't actually
have a billion dollars, huh?

456
00:32:47,193 --> 00:32:50,945
No, I get some of it
from banks, investors.

457
00:32:50,946 --> 00:32:53,448
It's not an easy thing to do.

458
00:32:53,449 --> 00:32:57,243
- And you don't make anything and you don't build anything.
- No. No.

459
00:32:57,244 --> 00:33:00,121
- So what do you do with the companies once you buy them?
- I sell them.

460
00:33:00,122 --> 00:33:03,166
Here, let me do that.
You sell them.

461
00:33:03,167 --> 00:33:06,753
Well, I... don't sell the whole company;
I break it up into pieces...

462
00:33:06,754 --> 00:33:09,255
and then I sell that off;
it's worth more than the whole.

463
00:33:09,256 --> 00:33:14,719
So it's sort of like, um, stealing cars
and selling 'em for the parts, right?

464
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:18,556
- Yeah, sort of. But legal.
- Mm-hmm.

465
00:33:18,557 --> 00:33:20,892
There. See, now it's perfect.

466
00:33:20,893 --> 00:33:24,854
Not bad. Not bad at all.
Where'd you learn to do that?

467
00:33:24,855 --> 00:33:29,067
Well, I screwed the debate team
in high school.

468
00:33:29,068 --> 00:33:34,405
I had a grandpa! He was nice to me.
He liked ties on Sundays.

469
00:33:34,406 --> 00:33:37,242
Mind if I, um, take a swim
in your tub before I go?

470
00:33:37,243 --> 00:33:41,663
Not at all. Just stay
in the shallow end.

471
00:33:42,957 --> 00:33:45,667
- Hello?
- Edward, it's Phil. Listen, I'm running out the door.

472
00:33:45,668 --> 00:33:47,919
I just wanted to let you know,
Morse is all set for tonight.

473
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,921
- Oh, that's good.
- He's bringing his grandson.

474
00:33:49,922 --> 00:33:52,173
He's grooming him
to take over. I don't know.

475
00:33:52,174 --> 00:33:56,970
Ah, yes. Very intense young man
named David. He plays polo.

476
00:33:56,971 --> 00:34:00,390
Look, I gotta say this again.
I don't like you goin' alone.

477
00:34:00,391 --> 00:34:03,476
I just want your extra time and your

478
00:34:03,477 --> 00:34:07,147
Look, I just think it'd be better
if you- if you went with a date.

479
00:34:07,148 --> 00:34:10,483
You know? Keep it social.

480
00:34:10,484 --> 00:34:13,987
- Edward? Did you hear me?
- Oh, yes. Yeah, I'm here.

481
00:34:13,988 --> 00:34:16,573
- If you want to impress me
- What is that?

482
00:34:16,574 --> 00:34:18,575
- Oh
- Housekeeping is singing.

483
00:34:18,576 --> 00:34:21,703
Got to be
too flirty, Mama

484
00:34:21,704 --> 00:34:24,956
- I know how to undress me
- Yeah... listen.

485
00:34:24,957 --> 00:34:28,460
- Edward, I know a lot of nice girls.
- No, you don't.

486
00:34:28,461 --> 00:34:32,422
I just want your extra time
and your

487
00:34:32,423 --> 00:34:35,049
Kiss

488
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:39,804
- Besides, I already have one.
- If you want to impress me

489
00:34:39,805 --> 00:34:44,350
You just concentrate on finding out
what Morse is up to. I'm on my way.

490
00:34:44,351 --> 00:34:49,314
I know how to undress me
Mm-hmm, yeah, baby

491
00:34:49,315 --> 00:34:53,401
I want to be your fantasy

492
00:34:53,402 --> 00:34:56,529
Well, maybe
you could be mine

493
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:59,240
Mm-hmm
You just leave it

494
00:34:59,241 --> 00:35:02,827
All up to me

495
00:35:02,828 --> 00:35:06,331
Don't you just love Prince?

496
00:35:06,332 --> 00:35:09,584
- More than life itself.
- Don't you knock?

497
00:35:09,585 --> 00:35:13,004
Vivian, I have a business
proposition for you.

498
00:35:13,005 --> 00:35:15,840
- What do you want?
- I'm gonna be in town until Sunday.

499
00:35:15,841 --> 00:35:18,927
I'd like you to spend
the week with me.

500
00:35:19,887 --> 00:35:22,680
- Really?
- Yes.

501
00:35:22,681 --> 00:35:25,183
Yes, I'd like to hire you
as an employee.

502
00:35:25,184 --> 00:35:30,021
- Would you consider spending
the week with me?

503
00:35:30,022 --> 00:35:33,942
I will pay you
to be at my beck and call.

504
00:35:33,943 --> 00:35:36,402
Look, I'd love to be your
"beck and call girl,"

505
00:35:36,403 --> 00:35:39,239
but you're a rich,
good-lookin' guy.

506
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,658
You could get
a million girls free.

507
00:35:41,659 --> 00:35:44,035
I want a professional.

508
00:35:44,036 --> 00:35:48,456
I don't need any romantic
hassles this week.

509
00:35:48,999 --> 00:35:51,960
If you're talkin' 24 hours
a day, it's gonna cost you.

510
00:35:51,961 --> 00:35:55,130
Oh, yes, of course!

511
00:35:55,131 --> 00:35:57,674
All right, here we go.

512
00:35:57,675 --> 00:35:59,884
Give me a ballpark figure.
How much?

513
00:35:59,885 --> 00:36:04,597
Six full nights, days too.

514
00:36:04,598 --> 00:36:09,060
- Four thousand.
- Six nights at 300 is 1,800.

515
00:36:09,061 --> 00:36:11,563
- You want days too.
- Two thousand.

516
00:36:11,564 --> 00:36:13,731
- Three thousand.
- Done.

517
00:36:13,732 --> 00:36:19,529
Holy shit!

518
00:36:19,989 --> 00:36:22,031
Vivian.

519
00:36:22,032 --> 00:36:25,326
Vivian, is that a yes?

520
00:36:27,329 --> 00:36:31,458
Yes.
Yes!

521
00:36:31,459 --> 00:36:34,878
I'll be gone most of the day.
I want you to buy some clothes.

522
00:36:34,879 --> 00:36:37,964
- You really should think about traveler's checks.
- We may be going out evenings.

523
00:36:37,965 --> 00:36:40,800
- You'll need something to wear.
- Like what?

524
00:36:40,801 --> 00:36:44,137
Uh, nothing too flashy.
Not too sexy.

525
00:36:44,138 --> 00:36:47,599
- Conservative. You understand?
- Boring.

526
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:50,435
Elegant. Any questions?

527
00:36:50,436 --> 00:36:53,605
- Can I call you Eddie?
- Not if you expect me to answer.

528
00:36:53,606 --> 00:36:56,941
I would've stayed for 2,000.

529
00:36:56,942 --> 00:36:59,694
I would've paid four.

530
00:36:59,695 --> 00:37:01,780
- I'll see you tonight.
- Baby, I'm gonna treat you so nice,

531
00:37:01,781 --> 00:37:05,617
you're never gonna
wanna let me go.

532
00:37:06,452 --> 00:37:12,081
Three thousand for six days.
And, Vivian, I will let you go.

533
00:37:15,294 --> 00:37:18,797
But I'm here now.

534
00:37:28,974 --> 00:37:34,020
Three thousand dollars!

535
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:39,651
Ooh.

536
00:37:43,656 --> 00:37:45,698
Hello?

537
00:37:45,699 --> 00:37:48,243
I called and called.
Where were you last night?

538
00:37:48,244 --> 00:37:50,328
- Ma?
- It's Viv.

539
00:37:50,329 --> 00:37:52,997
Oh. Hi. I had to party.
Where are you?

540
00:37:52,998 --> 00:37:55,583
Oh, man. Are you ready
for this? The guy?

541
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:59,170
The Lotus? I am in his hotel room
in Beverly Hills.

542
00:37:59,171 --> 00:38:02,674
The penthouse. His bathroom is bigger
than the Blue Banana!

543
00:38:02,675 --> 00:38:04,884
Do I have to hear this?

544
00:38:04,885 --> 00:38:08,096
Kit, he wants me to stay the whole week.
And you know what he's gonna give me?

545
00:38:08,097 --> 00:38:10,140
Guess. You'll never guess.

546
00:38:10,141 --> 00:38:13,017
- Three thousand dollars.
- Bullshit!

547
00:38:13,018 --> 00:38:15,603
I swear to God.
And extra money to buy clothes.

548
00:38:15,604 --> 00:38:19,315
Oh, man! I am bummed.
I gave that guy to you!

549
00:38:19,316 --> 00:38:21,901
Three thousand. Really?
Is he twisted?

550
00:38:21,902 --> 00:38:24,612
- No. - Ugly? -
He's good-looking!

551
00:38:24,613 --> 00:38:26,781
- Well, what's wrong with him?
- Nothing.

552
00:38:26,782 --> 00:38:30,452
- Did he give you the money yet? - At the end
of the week. - That's what's wrong with him.

553
00:38:30,453 --> 00:38:33,329
Well, he gave me 300
for last night. And, Kit?

554
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:36,291
I'm gonna leave some at the front desk
for you. I want you to pick it up.

555
00:38:36,292 --> 00:38:40,336
I'm at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.
Write it down.

556
00:38:40,337 --> 00:38:43,590
Are you writing it down?
You'll forget it. Write it down.

557
00:38:43,591 --> 00:38:47,427
Reg... Bev... Wil.

558
00:38:47,428 --> 00:38:51,139
Now, one more thing. Where do I go
for the clothes? Good stuff, on him.

559
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:53,141
- In Beverly Hills?
- Yeah.

560
00:38:53,142 --> 00:38:55,560
Rodeo Drive, baby.

561
00:39:00,065 --> 00:39:02,150
- Hi.
- Yes, ma'am. May I help you?

562
00:39:02,151 --> 00:39:06,029
Yeah, I'm leaving this here for
Kit De Luca. She's gonna pick it up.

563
00:39:06,113 --> 00:39:08,114
- Don't open that.
- No, ma'am.

564
00:39:11,827 --> 00:39:14,746
- Grazie.
- Arrivederci.

565
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,501
Miss Wilson,
do you know that lady?

566
00:39:19,502 --> 00:39:21,669
No, sir.

567
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:23,880
Wild women do

568
00:39:23,881 --> 00:39:28,635
And they don't regret it

569
00:39:29,386 --> 00:39:35,016
Wild women show
what they're goin' through

570
00:39:35,017 --> 00:39:37,310
Ooh

571
00:39:37,311 --> 00:39:44,526
Wild women do
what you think you'll never

572
00:39:44,902 --> 00:39:51,199
What you only dream about
wild women do

573
00:39:51,909 --> 00:39:55,662
Oh, yes, they do

574
00:39:57,248 --> 00:40:00,333
You tell me you
want a woman who

575
00:40:00,334 --> 00:40:04,212
Is simple as a flower

576
00:40:05,172 --> 00:40:07,674
Well, if you want me
to act like that

577
00:40:07,675 --> 00:40:12,053
You've got to pay me
by the hour

578
00:40:12,638 --> 00:40:19,227
Wild women do
and they don't regret it

579
00:40:19,311 --> 00:40:22,564
Oh, wild women show

580
00:40:22,565 --> 00:40:28,236
What they're goin' through
Ooh, yeah

581
00:40:28,237 --> 00:40:31,906
Wild women do
what you think you'll never

582
00:40:31,907 --> 00:40:35,743
- May I help you?
- I'm just checkin' things out.

583
00:40:35,744 --> 00:40:38,079
Are you looking for something
in particular?

584
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:42,792
No. Well, yeah.
Something... conservative.

585
00:40:42,793 --> 00:40:45,754
Yes.

586
00:40:47,548 --> 00:40:49,591
- You got nice stuff.
- Thank you.

587
00:40:49,592 --> 00:40:52,927
- How much is this?
- I don't think this would fit you.

588
00:40:52,928 --> 00:40:57,182
Well, I didn't ask if it would fit.
I asked how much it was.

589
00:40:57,183 --> 00:40:59,184
How much is this, Marie?

590
00:40:59,185 --> 00:41:01,561
It's very expensive.

591
00:41:01,562 --> 00:41:05,899
- It's very expensive.
- Look, I got money to spend in here.

592
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:08,777
I don't think
we have anything for you.

593
00:41:08,778 --> 00:41:10,779
You're obviously
in the wrong place.

594
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:14,073
Please leave.

595
00:41:28,464 --> 00:41:33,051
Doctor's office?
Two blocks down and to your left.

596
00:41:33,052 --> 00:41:35,970
Thank you.

597
00:41:41,393 --> 00:41:44,687
Tiffany is taking the corner
space; they like the project.

598
00:41:44,688 --> 00:41:47,023
We're very excited
about the whole thing.

599
00:41:47,024 --> 00:41:49,400
Did you realize that Via Rodeo
is the first new street...

600
00:41:49,401 --> 00:41:53,113
in Beverly Hills in 75 years?

601
00:41:53,697 --> 00:41:56,616
- Excuse me, miss, may I help you?
- I'm going to my room.

602
00:41:56,617 --> 00:42:00,203
- Uh, do you have a key?
- Oh. I forgot that cardboard thing.

603
00:42:00,204 --> 00:42:02,872
- I'm on the top floor.
- You're a guest here?

604
00:42:02,873 --> 00:42:06,000
- I'm with a friend.
- And who would that be?

605
00:42:06,001 --> 00:42:08,336
- Edward.
- Edward?

606
00:42:08,337 --> 00:42:11,923
Edward... Edward, uh-

607
00:42:12,049 --> 00:42:16,177
- He knows me.
- Dennis.

608
00:42:16,178 --> 00:42:19,139
Dennis, did you just come
off the night shift? Hmm?

609
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:21,724
- Yes, sir.
- Do you know this young lady?

610
00:42:21,725 --> 00:42:24,352
- She's with Mr. Lewis.
- Mr. Lewis.

611
00:42:24,353 --> 00:42:27,230
That's it. Edward Lewis!
Thanks, Dennis.

612
00:42:27,231 --> 00:42:30,984
- Evidently she joined him last night.
- Thank you.

613
00:42:31,527 --> 00:42:34,612
Oh, God! What now? What? What?

614
00:42:34,613 --> 00:42:36,948
- What is with everybody today?
- No, no. It's all right. Just come with me.

615
00:42:36,949 --> 00:42:39,200
- We'll have a little chat. Thank you. Dennis, thank you.
- I'm coming.

616
00:42:39,201 --> 00:42:42,495
- Uh, what is your name, miss?
- What do you want it to be?

617
00:42:42,496 --> 00:42:45,749
- Don't play with me, young lady.
- Vivian.

618
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:48,042
Thank you. Vivian.

619
00:42:48,043 --> 00:42:51,212
Well, Miss Vivian.

620
00:42:51,213 --> 00:42:55,717
Things that go on in other hotels don't
happen at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.

621
00:42:55,718 --> 00:42:58,595
Now, Mr. Lewis, however,
is a very special customer,

622
00:42:58,596 --> 00:43:01,723
and we like to think of our
special customers as friends.

623
00:43:01,724 --> 00:43:06,561
Now, as a customer, we would expect Mr.
Lewis to sign in any additional guests,

624
00:43:06,562 --> 00:43:08,897
but as a friend,
we're willing to overlook it.

625
00:43:08,898 --> 00:43:12,984
Now, I'm assuming
that you're a-

626
00:43:13,194 --> 00:43:16,070
- Relative?
- Yes.

627
00:43:16,071 --> 00:43:20,909
I thought so.
Then you must be his-

628
00:43:20,910 --> 00:43:23,411
Niece?

629
00:43:23,412 --> 00:43:29,959
Of course. Naturally, when Mr. Lewis
leaves, I won't see you in this hotel again.

630
00:43:30,377 --> 00:43:34,089
I assume you have
no other uncles here.

631
00:43:35,007 --> 00:43:37,550
Good! Then we understand each other.
I would also encourage you...

632
00:43:37,551 --> 00:43:40,512
to dress a little more
appropriately; that'll be all.

633
00:43:40,513 --> 00:43:43,264
No, that's not all. That's what
I was trying to do. I tried to go...

634
00:43:43,265 --> 00:43:46,226
get a dress on Rodeo Drive today,
and the women wouldn't help me.

635
00:43:46,227 --> 00:43:48,394
And I have all this money
now and no dress!

636
00:43:48,395 --> 00:43:51,189
Not that I expect you to help me,
but I have all of this, okay?

637
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:53,566
I have to buy a dress
for dinner tonight.

638
00:43:53,567 --> 00:43:57,237
And nobody will help me.

639
00:44:08,624 --> 00:44:10,708
Oh, man, if you're
callin' the cops.

640
00:44:10,709 --> 00:44:14,546
Yeah, call the cops.
That's great. Tell 'em I said hi.

641
00:44:14,547 --> 00:44:16,798
Women's clothing.

642
00:44:16,799 --> 00:44:19,884
Bridget, please.

643
00:44:27,726 --> 00:44:33,606
Yes, Bridget. Hello. This is Barnard
Thompson here at the Regent Beverly Wil-

644
00:44:33,607 --> 00:44:38,403
Thank you, yes, but I'd
like you to do a favor for me, please.

645
00:44:38,404 --> 00:44:40,822
I'm sending someone over.
Her name is Vivian.

646
00:44:40,823 --> 00:44:42,991
She's a special guest.

647
00:44:42,992 --> 00:44:47,787
She's the niece
of a very special guest.

648
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:50,707
Now, this is the jewel in Morse's crown:

649
00:44:50,708 --> 00:44:53,710
prime industrial property straddling
the port of Long Beach and Los Angeles.

650
00:44:53,711 --> 00:44:57,547
The real estate possibilities are endless,
but most of the yard we'll just level.

651
00:44:57,548 --> 00:45:00,383
We just got the information,
Mr. Stuckey.

652
00:45:00,384 --> 00:45:04,304
Edward, we just got the Morse update.
Don, can you hold the projection, please?

653
00:45:04,305 --> 00:45:07,098
Yeah, what? Speak.

654
00:45:07,099 --> 00:45:12,353
Old Man Morse just got the inside track
on a $350 million contract...

655
00:45:12,354 --> 00:45:14,439
to build destroyers for the Navy.

656
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:16,441
Navy contract.
I can't believe this.

657
00:45:16,442 --> 00:45:20,445
- You said they had nothing in the hopper on this one!
- I thought they didn't.

658
00:45:20,446 --> 00:45:22,447
Hey, you know, if that's true
it could cost a lot more.

659
00:45:22,448 --> 00:45:24,449
Those stocks could go
through the roof.

660
00:45:24,450 --> 00:45:28,745
- Yeah, no shit, Sherlock.
- Maybe we're lucky to get this information now, sir.

661
00:45:28,746 --> 00:45:31,372
- See, we can still walk away from it.
- Walk away?

662
00:45:31,373 --> 00:45:33,416
Hey, forget it, pal. We got
a thousand man-hours in on this!

663
00:45:33,417 --> 00:45:35,919
- Nobody's walkin' away from anything!
- Philip, I think he's right.

664
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,379
Gentlemen, relax!

665
00:45:38,380 --> 00:45:42,717
Relax! Who do we know on
the Senate Appropriations Committee?

666
00:45:42,718 --> 00:45:44,886
Senator Adams.

667
00:45:44,887 --> 00:45:46,930
All right, Senator Adams.
Let's find out where he is.

668
00:45:46,931 --> 00:45:51,810
The Navy's not gonna spend $350 million on
anything without going to Appropriations first.

669
00:45:51,811 --> 00:45:54,104
- I don't understand what's goin' on here today, gentlemen.
- Hello?

670
00:45:54,105 --> 00:45:56,898
That's why I hired you,
Phil, to do my worrying for me.

671
00:45:56,899 --> 00:45:58,983
I'll be in your office. Bob, if you
want to send over the geologicals?

672
00:45:58,984 --> 00:46:01,986
- No problem. -
Thank you. - Edward.

673
00:46:01,987 --> 00:46:05,740
- Listen, everything all set for
the meeting tonight? - Mm-hmm.

674
00:46:05,741 --> 00:46:09,035
Who- Who is this girl
you're going with?

675
00:46:09,036 --> 00:46:11,037
Nobody you know.

676
00:46:11,038 --> 00:46:13,915
Yes,
Edward Lewis Enterprises. Phil Stuckey.

677
00:46:13,916 --> 00:46:15,917
Yes, I have him right here.

678
00:46:15,918 --> 00:46:19,546
- Don't worry, Mrs. Rainey, I'll call you the minute it comes in.
- Thank you.

679
00:46:19,547 --> 00:46:22,882
- Have a nice day.
- Thank you.

680
00:46:26,846 --> 00:46:29,889
Hello. You must be Vivian.
My name's Bridget.

681
00:46:29,890 --> 00:46:32,684
- Yeah, hi. Barney said
you'd be nice to me.

682
00:46:32,685 --> 00:46:37,105
He's very sweet. What are your plans
while you're in town?

683
00:46:37,106 --> 00:46:39,232
- We're gonna have dinner.
- Oh, don't sit on there, dear!

684
00:46:39,233 --> 00:46:42,026
- You're gonna go out? Dinner?
- Mm-hmm.

685
00:46:42,027 --> 00:46:45,113
Well, you'll need a cocktail dress
then. Come with me.

686
00:46:45,114 --> 00:46:48,283
Now, I'm sure we're gonna find something
here that your uncle will love.

687
00:46:48,284 --> 00:46:51,911
- You're a size six, right?
- Yeah. How'd you know that?

688
00:46:51,912 --> 00:46:55,331
- Oh, that's my job.
- Bridg, he's not really my uncle.

689
00:46:55,332 --> 00:46:57,709
They never are, dear.

690
00:47:01,005 --> 00:47:03,006
Barney! Sorry, mister.

691
00:47:03,007 --> 00:47:05,258
I got a dress!

692
00:47:05,259 --> 00:47:07,260
Well, I'd rather hoped
you'd be wearing it.

693
00:47:07,261 --> 00:47:09,596
Oh, no, I didn't want to get it messed
up! Listen, I got shoes too. You wanna see?

694
00:47:09,597 --> 00:47:12,307
No, that won't be necessary. I'm
sure they're quite lovely. Thank you.

695
00:47:12,308 --> 00:47:14,517
Okay, well, listen. I didn't mean to
interrupt you, but Bridget was really great...

696
00:47:14,518 --> 00:47:16,519
and I just wanted
to say thanks.

697
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:20,231
- You're cool.
- You're welcome, Miss Vivian.

698
00:47:25,362 --> 00:47:27,363
Hello?

699
00:47:27,364 --> 00:47:29,574
Never, ever pick up the phone.

700
00:47:29,575 --> 00:47:32,911
- Then why are you calling me?
- Did you buy clothes today?

701
00:47:32,912 --> 00:47:35,455
- I got a dress. A cocktail one.
- That's good.

702
00:47:35,456 --> 00:47:37,707
I'll be in the hotel lobby,
7:45 sharp.

703
00:47:37,708 --> 00:47:39,709
What? You're not comin'
up to the door?

704
00:47:39,710 --> 00:47:41,711
This isn't a date.
It's business.

705
00:47:41,712 --> 00:47:43,838
Where are you takin' me,
anyway?

706
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:46,007
I'm taking you to a restaurant
called the Voltaire.

707
00:47:46,008 --> 00:47:48,468
- Very elegant.
- All right.

708
00:47:48,469 --> 00:47:51,596
I'll meet you in the lobby, but
only 'cause you're payin' me to.

709
00:47:51,597 --> 00:47:54,891
Well, thank you very much.

710
00:47:56,268 --> 00:47:59,104
Get her back for me,
please.

711
00:47:59,105 --> 00:48:05,026
- Mr. Stuckey wanted to see you.
- Yes, tell him I'm in the middle of a very important phone call.

712
00:48:05,027 --> 00:48:07,445
Hello?

713
00:48:07,446 --> 00:48:11,157
- I told you not to pick up the phone.
- Then stop callin' me.

714
00:48:11,158 --> 00:48:16,746
Sick.

715
00:48:17,373 --> 00:48:21,000
- Barney!
- It didn't fit.

716
00:48:21,001 --> 00:48:25,004
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Uh- I've got a little problem.

717
00:48:25,005 --> 00:48:27,006
All right, Miss Vivian,
one more time.

718
00:48:27,007 --> 00:48:31,302
- Dinner napkin.
- Dinner napkin, laid gently in the lap.

719
00:48:31,303 --> 00:48:35,765
Good. Elbows off the table.
Don't slouch.

720
00:48:35,766 --> 00:48:38,143
Shrimp fork,

721
00:48:38,144 --> 00:48:41,104
salad fork, dinner fork.

722
00:48:41,105 --> 00:48:43,106
I definitely have
the salad fork.

723
00:48:43,107 --> 00:48:45,942
The rest of the silverware
is a little confusing.

724
00:48:45,943 --> 00:48:48,445
All right, if you get nervous,
just count the tines.

725
00:48:48,446 --> 00:48:50,780
Four tines: dinner fork.

726
00:48:50,781 --> 00:48:56,953
And sometimes there are three tines
in the salad fork. And sometimes-

727
00:49:09,341 --> 00:49:12,469
Pardon me, Mr. Lewis. I'm Mr. Thompson.
I'm the manager of the hotel.

728
00:49:12,470 --> 00:49:14,804
- Uh-huh. Excuse me, I just want
to make one call. - Yes, um, sir.

729
00:49:14,805 --> 00:49:17,432
- I have a message for you, sir.
- From who?

730
00:49:17,433 --> 00:49:20,643
- From your niece, sir.
- My what?

731
00:49:20,644 --> 00:49:23,229
The young lady who's staying
with you in your room, sir.

732
00:49:23,230 --> 00:49:26,983
Oh. Hmm.

733
00:49:26,984 --> 00:49:30,153
- I think we both know that she's not my niece.
- Of course.

734
00:49:30,154 --> 00:49:32,697
The reason I know that is
that I am an only child.

735
00:49:32,698 --> 00:49:35,825
- Yes, sir.
- What's the message?

736
00:49:35,826 --> 00:49:37,827
She's waiting for you
in the lounge.

737
00:49:37,828 --> 00:49:42,290
Intriguing young lady,
Miss Vivian.

738
00:49:42,291 --> 00:49:46,211
- Intriguing.
- Have a good evening, sir.

739
00:49:46,212 --> 00:49:52,050
- Thank you, Mr. -? - Thompson. I'm
the manager- manager of the hotel, sir.

740
00:50:28,462 --> 00:50:30,463
You're late.

741
00:50:30,464 --> 00:50:32,549
You're stunning.

742
00:50:32,550 --> 00:50:35,885
You're forgiven.

743
00:50:36,512 --> 00:50:39,973
Shall we go to dinner?

744
00:50:51,110 --> 00:50:56,114
- This way, Mr. Lewis. Your party is waiting.
- Stop fidgeting.

745
00:50:58,325 --> 00:51:02,203
- Mr. Morse.
- Yes, Mr. Lewis. I'm Jim Morse.

746
00:51:02,204 --> 00:51:06,833
This fireball is my grandson,
David.

747
00:51:06,834 --> 00:51:09,377
Well, I don't know about the fireball
part, but grandson is true enough.

748
00:51:09,378 --> 00:51:12,338
I'm pleased to meet you both.
This is a friend of mine, Vivian Ward.

749
00:51:12,339 --> 00:51:16,426
- Hi. I'm really glad to meet you.
- Mr. Morse. David.

750
00:51:16,427 --> 00:51:19,345
Please, sit.

751
00:51:23,601 --> 00:51:26,519
Excuse me.

752
00:51:27,438 --> 00:51:32,025
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to the ladies' room.

753
00:51:32,610 --> 00:51:37,071
- Upstairs, to the right.
- Okay. Excuse me.

754
00:51:37,156 --> 00:51:41,284
- Shall I order for you?
- Yeah.

755
00:51:41,285 --> 00:51:43,286
Please do so. Thank you.

756
00:51:43,287 --> 00:51:46,247
I'll do that.

757
00:51:52,463 --> 00:51:55,131
Mr. Lewis, my grandfather believes
the men who create a company...

758
00:51:55,132 --> 00:51:58,927
- should control its destiny.
- Where's the salad?

759
00:51:59,804 --> 00:52:02,514
Uh, the salad comes
at the end of the meal.

760
00:52:02,515 --> 00:52:05,975
That's the fork I knew.

761
00:52:05,976 --> 00:52:08,812
Let me, uh, put it another way.

762
00:52:08,813 --> 00:52:12,190
Between your public statements and the
rumors flying around on this thing,

763
00:52:12,191 --> 00:52:15,068
we find it very hard to figure out what
your real intentions are.

764
00:52:15,069 --> 00:52:18,988
I don't know about you, but I've never
been able to figure which goes with what!

765
00:52:35,256 --> 00:52:38,091
You know, there was a time when
we built ships the size of cities.

766
00:52:38,092 --> 00:52:41,386
- Men like my grandfather made this country.
- Who ordered this?

767
00:52:41,387 --> 00:52:43,638
The gentleman did, ma'am. Bon appetite.

768
00:52:43,639 --> 00:52:47,434
These are escargot. It's French
for snails. It's a delicacy.

769
00:52:47,435 --> 00:52:50,437
Try it. David?

770
00:52:50,438 --> 00:52:54,816
Mr. Lewis, if you were to get control-
and I don't think you will- but if you did,

771
00:52:54,817 --> 00:52:57,777
what do you plan to do
with the company?

772
00:52:57,778 --> 00:52:59,904
Break it up
and sell off the pieces.

773
00:52:59,905 --> 00:53:02,949
I'm sure you'll understand
I'm not thrilled at the idea...

774
00:53:02,950 --> 00:53:07,620
of your turning 40 years of my work
into your garage sale.

775
00:53:07,621 --> 00:53:10,832
At the price I'm paying for this stock, Mr.
Morse, you are going to be a very rich man.

776
00:53:10,833 --> 00:53:16,171
I'm rich enough. I just want
to head my shipyard.

777
00:53:17,757 --> 00:53:21,593
Slippery little suckers.

778
00:53:22,678 --> 00:53:26,431
It happens all the time.

779
00:53:26,974 --> 00:53:30,018
I met your father.
What's his name?

780
00:53:30,019 --> 00:53:34,814
- Carter.
- Yeah. Carter. Carter Lewis.

781
00:53:34,815 --> 00:53:37,400
He's not quite the bastard
everybody says he is.

782
00:53:37,401 --> 00:53:40,820
- No, I have the franchise on that.
- Does that make him proud?

783
00:53:40,821 --> 00:53:45,658
I doubt it. It doesn't
really matter now. He passed away.

784
00:53:45,659 --> 00:53:48,328
Oh, I hadn't heard.
I'm sorry.

785
00:53:48,329 --> 00:53:50,330
I'm sorry too.

786
00:53:50,331 --> 00:53:54,167
Mr. Morse, you asked for this meeting.
What can I do for you?

787
00:53:54,168 --> 00:53:59,172
- Leave my company alone.
- I can't do that. I own ten million shares.

788
00:53:59,173 --> 00:54:02,175
- I'll buy your stock back.
- You don't have the money.

789
00:54:02,176 --> 00:54:04,844
We will; we're getting a contract
to build ten destroyers.

790
00:54:04,845 --> 00:54:08,306
There will be no contract. The contract
is now buried in Appropriations Committee.

791
00:54:08,307 --> 00:54:11,851
- And it will remain there.
- And how the hell did you pull something like that?

792
00:54:11,852 --> 00:54:13,895
You got dirty politicians in
your pockets now or something?

793
00:54:13,896 --> 00:54:16,397
Easy, easy,
calm down. Calm down, David.

794
00:54:16,398 --> 00:54:20,610
- Mr. Lewis plays hardball.
- Yes, yes, I do.

795
00:54:20,611 --> 00:54:24,239
I've heard enough of this. Vivian,
it was a great pleasure to meet you.

796
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:28,827
I'm sorry, Grandfather.
I've gotta get some air. Mr. Lewis.

797
00:54:28,828 --> 00:54:31,871
I'd better join my grandson.
You two enjoy your dinner.

798
00:54:31,872 --> 00:54:36,167
I'm sure it'll be delicious.
Good luck, miss.

799
00:54:36,377 --> 00:54:40,505
Watch out, Lewis.
I'm gonna tear you apart.

800
00:54:40,506 --> 00:54:43,968
I look forward to it, sir.

801
00:54:52,812 --> 00:54:55,022
Edward?

802
00:54:57,492 --> 00:54:59,911
Edward, you said you never
come out here.

803
00:54:59,994 --> 00:55:03,665
Well, I'm only halfway out.

804
00:55:03,748 --> 00:55:07,502
Didn't say much in the car
on the way home.

805
00:55:07,544 --> 00:55:11,131
You thinkin' about dinner?
I was a maniac.

806
00:55:11,214 --> 00:55:14,759
I mean, the business
was good, I think. You know?

807
00:55:14,843 --> 00:55:18,346
He's in trouble.
You want his company.

808
00:55:18,430 --> 00:55:20,348
He doesn't want
to let it go.

809
00:55:20,432 --> 00:55:22,642
Thanks for the recap.

810
00:55:22,684 --> 00:55:26,521
The problem is, I think
you liked Mr. Morse.

811
00:55:26,563 --> 00:55:29,816
I'd like for you to get down from there;
you're making me very nervous.

812
00:55:29,858 --> 00:55:33,278
It's making you nervous? What if I just
leaned back a little bit like this?

813
00:55:33,361 --> 00:55:35,321
Would you- Would you
rescue me if I fell?

814
00:55:35,363 --> 00:55:37,365
Vivian, I'm serious.
Come- I'm not looking.

815
00:55:37,449 --> 00:55:41,369
It's really high. Look, no hands,
no hands! Okay, all right. I'm sorry.

816
00:55:43,455 --> 00:55:49,252
The truth is, it really is totally
irrelevant whether I like this man or not.

817
00:55:49,335 --> 00:55:52,714
I will not let myself become
emotionally involved in business.

818
00:55:52,797 --> 00:55:57,510
I know.
Kit's always saying to me,

819
00:55:57,552 --> 00:55:59,679
"Don't get emotional
when you turn tricks. "

820
00:55:59,721 --> 00:56:02,599
That's why no kissing.
It's too personal.

821
00:56:02,682 --> 00:56:05,602
It's like what you're saying:
You stay numb, you don't get involved.

822
00:56:05,685 --> 00:56:08,938
When I'm with a guy,
I'm like a robot. I just do it.

823
00:56:14,444 --> 00:56:17,363
I mean... except with you.

824
00:56:17,405 --> 00:56:19,949
Oh, of course, not with me.

825
00:56:21,659 --> 00:56:25,246
You and I are such similar
creatures, Vivian.

826
00:56:25,330 --> 00:56:27,582
We both screw people
for money.

827
00:56:33,797 --> 00:56:35,757
I was sorry to hear
about your dad.

828
00:56:35,799 --> 00:56:39,427
- When did he die?
- Last month.

829
00:56:41,262 --> 00:56:43,223
Do you miss him?

830
00:56:43,264 --> 00:56:48,561
I hadn't spoken to him
in fourteen and a half years.

831
00:56:50,438 --> 00:56:53,441
I wasn't there
when he died.

832
00:56:53,525 --> 00:56:56,319
- Do you want to talk about this?
- No.

833
00:56:56,402 --> 00:57:00,782
Well, I tell you what,
'cause I got an idea.

834
00:57:00,824 --> 00:57:06,121
Let's watch old movies all night.
We'll just veg out in front of the TV.

835
00:57:06,162 --> 00:57:11,000
- "Veg out"?
- Yeah. Be still like vegetables. Lay like broccoli.

836
00:57:13,628 --> 00:57:18,591
Look, I'll tell you what. I'll be back.
We'll do broccoli tomorrow.

837
00:57:20,051 --> 00:57:23,972
- Where are you going?
- I'm going downstairs for a while.

838
00:57:25,974 --> 00:57:28,184
Did you say
marriage license?

839
00:57:28,268 --> 00:57:30,770
Now, don't change the subject,
just give me the stamp.

840
00:57:30,854 --> 00:57:35,817
Oh, I love you, Adam, Alex, Peter,
Brian, whatever your name is.

841
00:57:35,859 --> 00:57:37,819
Oh, I love you.

842
00:57:50,039 --> 00:57:54,085
Hi, uh, I'm in the penthouse.
The guy that was here,

843
00:57:54,169 --> 00:57:57,797
Mr. Lewis, have you seen him
down there anywhere?

844
00:58:37,378 --> 00:58:39,380
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

845
00:58:39,422 --> 00:58:42,467
I didn't know you played.

846
00:58:42,550 --> 00:58:44,469
I only play for strangers.

847
00:58:44,552 --> 00:58:48,306
I was gettin' lonely
upstairs all by myself.

848
00:58:53,812 --> 00:58:57,690
Gentlemen, would you mind
leaving us, please?

849
00:59:00,652 --> 00:59:02,570
Thank you.

850
00:59:04,572 --> 00:59:07,659
People always do
what you tell them to do?

851
00:59:38,773 --> 00:59:41,109
I guess so.

852
01:00:40,168 --> 01:00:42,087
Wake up. Time to shop.

853
01:00:44,339 --> 01:00:48,635
Now, if you have any trouble using
this card, have them call the hotel.

854
01:00:48,718 --> 01:00:51,346
All right?

855
01:00:51,387 --> 01:00:53,473
More shopping.

856
01:00:53,556 --> 01:00:55,683
Mm-hmm.

857
01:00:55,767 --> 01:00:59,938
I'm surprised you didn't
buy more than one dress yesterday.

858
01:01:00,021 --> 01:01:03,733
- Wasn't as much fun as I thought it was gonna be.
- Why not?

859
01:01:03,817 --> 01:01:06,402
They were mean to me.

860
01:01:06,486 --> 01:01:08,863
Mean to you?

861
01:01:11,199 --> 01:01:13,118
People are looking at me.

862
01:01:13,201 --> 01:01:15,829
They're not looking at you;
they're looking at me.

863
01:01:15,912 --> 01:01:18,331
The stores are not nice to people.
I don't like it.

864
01:01:18,415 --> 01:01:23,169
Stores are never nice to people;
they're nice to credit cards.

865
01:01:23,253 --> 01:01:27,132
Okay, stop fidgeting.
Get rid of your gum.

866
01:01:29,634 --> 01:01:31,803
I don't believe
you did that.

867
01:01:33,972 --> 01:01:37,725
- Yes.
- I am Mr. Hollister, the manager. May I help you?

868
01:01:37,809 --> 01:01:40,145
- Edward Lewis.
- Ah, yes, sir.

869
01:01:40,228 --> 01:01:43,773
- You see this young lady over here.
- Yes.

870
01:01:43,857 --> 01:01:48,278
- Do you have anything in this shop as beautiful as she is?
- Oh, yes.

871
01:01:48,319 --> 01:01:53,908
Oh, no! No, no, no, I'm saying we have many
things as beautiful as she would want them to be.

872
01:01:53,950 --> 01:01:56,786
That's the point I was getting at,
and I think we can all agree with that.

873
01:01:56,870 --> 01:02:01,291
- That's why when you came in- - Excuse me.
We're gonna need a few more people helping us.

874
01:02:01,332 --> 01:02:05,795
I'll tell you why. We're going to be
spending an obscene amount of money in here.

875
01:02:05,837 --> 01:02:08,757
So we're going to need
a lot more help sucking up to us.

876
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:11,259
That's what we really like.
You understand that.

877
01:02:11,342 --> 01:02:14,345
Sir, you're in the right store
and the right city for that matter.

878
01:02:14,429 --> 01:02:17,557
Anything you see here, we can do,
by the way. Get ready to have some fun.

879
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:20,268
Mary Pat, Mary Kate,
Mary Francis, Tovah, let's see it!

880
01:02:20,351 --> 01:02:22,729
- Come on. Bring it out, girls.
- Oh, this is absolutely divine.

881
01:02:22,812 --> 01:02:24,647
- Excuse me, sir, uh,
- Yeah?

882
01:02:24,731 --> 01:02:28,610
exactly how obscene an amount of money
were you talking about?

883
01:02:28,693 --> 01:02:30,945
Just profane
or really offensive?

884
01:02:31,029 --> 01:02:35,241
- Really offensive.
- I like him so much!

885
01:02:50,465 --> 01:02:53,927
Mr. Lewis, sir. Mr. Lewis, how's it
going so far? Pretty well, I think.

886
01:02:54,010 --> 01:02:57,347
I think we need some
major sucking up.

887
01:02:57,430 --> 01:03:01,309
Very well, sir. You're not only
handsome, but a powerful man.

888
01:03:01,351 --> 01:03:04,145
I could see the second you walked in
here, you were someone to reckon with-

889
01:03:04,229 --> 01:03:06,147
- Hollister.
- Yes, sir.

890
01:03:06,231 --> 01:03:08,233
Not me. Her.

891
01:03:08,316 --> 01:03:10,360
I'm sorry, sir. I'm sorry.

892
01:03:10,443 --> 01:03:12,362
How we doing, ladies?

893
01:03:12,445 --> 01:03:14,364
Oh, Edward, Edward.
Where the hell are you?

894
01:03:14,447 --> 01:03:17,158
The word's all over the street.
Morse is gonna raise your offer, pal.

895
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:20,703
He's countering?
God, he is a tough old bird.

896
01:03:20,787 --> 01:03:23,540
He knows the navy contracts are stalled.
Where's he gonna get the money?

897
01:03:23,623 --> 01:03:25,917
I don't know. He, uh- I think
he's throwin' in with the employees.

898
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,336
He still needs someone
to underwrite the paper.

899
01:03:28,420 --> 01:03:31,297
- Find out who it is.
- Yeah, okay. You got it.

900
01:03:31,381 --> 01:03:35,427
You're on your own. I have to go
back to work. You look great!

901
01:03:35,510 --> 01:03:38,346
- She has my card.
- And we'll help her use it, sir.

902
01:03:41,724 --> 01:03:45,061
# Pretty woman
walking down the street #

903
01:03:45,145 --> 01:03:49,023
# Pretty woman
the kind I like to meet #

904
01:03:49,107 --> 01:03:51,693
# Pretty woman #

905
01:03:51,734 --> 01:03:55,905
# I don't believe you
You're not the truth #

906
01:03:55,989 --> 01:04:01,202
# No one could look as good as you
Mercy #

907
01:04:05,749 --> 01:04:08,126
- Edward would love that tie.
- Would you give her the tie?

908
01:04:08,209 --> 01:04:10,170
- The tie?
- Take off the tie. Give her the tie.

909
01:04:10,253 --> 01:04:12,672
- He wants to do this, by the way.
- He would go crazy about this tie.

910
01:04:12,756 --> 01:04:14,674
Who ordered pizza?

911
01:04:14,758 --> 01:04:18,178
# Pretty woman, stop a while #

912
01:04:18,261 --> 01:04:21,848
# Pretty woman, talk a while #

913
01:04:21,931 --> 01:04:27,395
# Pretty woman
give your smile to me #

914
01:04:29,439 --> 01:04:33,234
# Pretty woman
Yeah, yeah, yeah #

915
01:04:33,276 --> 01:04:36,905
# Pretty woman, look my way #

916
01:04:36,988 --> 01:04:39,407
# Pretty woman #

917
01:04:39,491 --> 01:04:41,493
- May I help you?
- No, thank you. Hi.

918
01:04:41,576 --> 01:04:43,495
- Hello.
- Do you remember me?

919
01:04:43,578 --> 01:04:46,998
- No, I'm sorry.
- I was in here yesterday. You wouldn't wait on me.

920
01:04:47,082 --> 01:04:49,751
- Oh.
- You work on commission, right?

921
01:04:49,793 --> 01:04:51,753
Uh, yes.

922
01:04:51,795 --> 01:04:54,506
Big mistake. Big. Huge!

923
01:04:54,589 --> 01:04:57,926
I have to go shopping now.

924
01:04:58,009 --> 01:05:01,429
# Pretty woman
don't walk on by #

925
01:05:01,513 --> 01:05:05,350
# Pretty woman
don't make me cry #

926
01:05:05,433 --> 01:05:08,144
# Pretty woman #

927
01:05:08,228 --> 01:05:12,857
# Don't walk away, hey #

928
01:05:16,194 --> 01:05:18,113
Thank you.

929
01:05:18,196 --> 01:05:23,410
# Oh, oh, pretty woman ##

930
01:05:23,493 --> 01:05:25,203
- Mister Lewis.
- Gentlemen.

931
01:05:25,286 --> 01:05:27,414
Fellas, let's finish this up
this afternoon, huh?

932
01:05:27,497 --> 01:05:31,584
Jake, set something up with Blair.
Around 2:00, 2:30 would be good.

933
01:05:31,668 --> 01:05:36,089
You were right about Morse. He mortgaged
everything he owns, right down to his underwear,

934
01:05:36,172 --> 01:05:38,258
to secure a loan from the bank.

935
01:05:38,341 --> 01:05:41,094
And it's not just any bank.
Plymouth Trust, huh?

936
01:05:41,177 --> 01:05:43,638
- Hmm.
- So, it goes without saying...

937
01:05:43,721 --> 01:05:46,015
that your business means a lot more
to them than our friend, Mr. Morse.

938
01:05:46,099 --> 01:05:48,518
All you gotta do
is call the bank.

939
01:05:52,021 --> 01:05:53,940
Yeah.

940
01:05:57,819 --> 01:06:02,282
Edward, excuse me for saying this, but
what the hell is wrong with you this week?

941
01:06:02,365 --> 01:06:06,327
Are you givin' Morse a chance
to get away?

942
01:06:06,411 --> 01:06:10,874
You know what I used to love
when I was a kid, Phil?

943
01:06:10,915 --> 01:06:13,710
What?

944
01:06:13,793 --> 01:06:15,712
Blocks.

945
01:06:17,297 --> 01:06:19,507
Building blocks.
Erector sets.

946
01:06:19,549 --> 01:06:24,012
So, I liked Monopoly. Boardwalk,
Park Place. Wh-What's the point?

947
01:06:24,053 --> 01:06:28,266
We don't build anything, Phil.
We don't make anything.

948
01:06:28,349 --> 01:06:30,518
We make money, Edward.

949
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:34,022
We worked for a year on this deal.
It's what you said you wanted.

950
01:06:34,105 --> 01:06:36,149
I'm handing it to you.

951
01:06:36,232 --> 01:06:40,195
Morse's jugular is exposed.
It's time for the kill.

952
01:06:40,278 --> 01:06:42,363
Let's finish this.

953
01:06:42,447 --> 01:06:44,365
Call the bank!

954
01:07:05,595 --> 01:07:07,514
How was your day, dear?

955
01:07:11,101 --> 01:07:13,311
Nice tie.

956
01:07:13,394 --> 01:07:15,355
I got it for you.

957
01:07:17,690 --> 01:07:20,401
Well, my mother
was a music teacher...

958
01:07:20,485 --> 01:07:25,115
and married my father, whose
family was extremely wealthy.

959
01:07:25,198 --> 01:07:29,285
Then he divorced my mother
to be with another woman.

960
01:07:29,369 --> 01:07:31,704
And he took his money with him.

961
01:07:32,789 --> 01:07:35,208
And then she died.

962
01:07:35,291 --> 01:07:37,293
I was very angry with him.

963
01:07:37,377 --> 01:07:40,338
It cost me $10,000 in therapy
to say that sentence.

964
01:07:40,380 --> 01:07:42,340
I was very angry with him.

965
01:07:42,382 --> 01:07:44,926
I do it very well, don't I? I'll say
it again. I was very angry with him.

966
01:07:45,009 --> 01:07:48,638
Hello, my name is Mr. Lewis.
I'm very angry with my father.

967
01:07:48,721 --> 01:07:52,642
I would've been angry
at the $10,000.

968
01:07:52,725 --> 01:07:58,523
My father was president
of the third company I ever took over.

969
01:07:59,941 --> 01:08:03,778
I bought it.
I sold it off piece by piece.

970
01:08:03,862 --> 01:08:07,657
- What'd the shrink say?
- He said I was cured.

971
01:08:07,741 --> 01:08:11,161
Well, so you got even.
That must've made you happy.

972
01:08:16,791 --> 01:08:20,962
Did I mention my leg
is 44 inches from hip to toe,

973
01:08:21,045 --> 01:08:26,551
so, basically, we're talkin'
about 88 inches of therapy...

974
01:08:26,593 --> 01:08:30,054
wrapped around you
for the bargain price of...

975
01:08:30,096 --> 01:08:32,849
$3,000.

976
01:08:32,932 --> 01:08:35,518
Yeah.

977
01:08:37,562 --> 01:08:40,231
Ebersol of the Falcons passes to Kennan.

978
01:08:40,273 --> 01:08:42,817
This is Bill Fricker with Gwen Olsen
giving you play-by-play...

979
01:08:42,901 --> 01:08:45,111
- of this marvelous charity event.
- Watch where you're walking.

980
01:08:45,195 --> 01:08:48,531
If you step in something,
we're not going back in the car.

981
01:08:48,615 --> 01:08:53,286
Not too near the tree. I don't like the
ants. Hello. Have you seen Edward anywhere?

982
01:08:53,369 --> 01:08:57,791
- What if someone recognizes me?
- Not likely. They don't spend too much time on Hollywood Blvd.

983
01:08:57,832 --> 01:09:01,169
- You did.
- Come on. Let go. Let go.

984
01:09:01,252 --> 01:09:03,922
All right. You look great.
You look like a lady.

985
01:09:04,005 --> 01:09:05,965
You're gonna
have a wonderful time.

986
01:09:08,009 --> 01:09:11,221
Okay. Don't fidget and smile.

987
01:09:11,304 --> 01:09:13,848
Humboldt's coming around to this side.

988
01:09:13,932 --> 01:09:16,226
Toquenee is on Kennan.
Penalty on that play.

989
01:09:16,309 --> 01:09:19,562
This is Gwen and Gretchen,
the infamous Olsen sisters,

990
01:09:19,646 --> 01:09:22,190
who have made marrying well
an art form.

991
01:09:22,273 --> 01:09:24,442
- Edward.
- Be back in just a second. Hold on.

992
01:09:24,526 --> 01:09:27,278
So, you're the flavor
of the month. Hmm.

993
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:31,491
Uh, she's just being testy.
Edward's our most eligible bachelor.

994
01:09:31,574 --> 01:09:33,493
Everybody is
trying to land him.

995
01:09:33,576 --> 01:09:38,498
Well, I'm not trying to land him.
I'm just using him for sex.

996
01:09:38,581 --> 01:09:41,501
Oh, yes.

997
01:09:41,584 --> 01:09:45,130
- Well done.
- Well done. Whoo, whoo, whoo!

998
01:09:47,090 --> 01:09:49,801
Tell me again
why we're here.

999
01:09:49,843 --> 01:09:52,220
- Business.
- Business mingling?

1000
01:09:52,303 --> 01:09:54,639
Yeah.

1001
01:09:54,681 --> 01:09:56,808
That's
the chukker, ladies and gentlemen.

1002
01:09:56,850 --> 01:09:58,810
Falcons, seven.
Gems, four.

1003
01:09:58,852 --> 01:10:03,064
- Excuse me. Edward! Edward. Over here.
- Phil.

1004
01:10:03,148 --> 01:10:05,066
- Ah, good to see you.
- You too.

1005
01:10:05,150 --> 01:10:07,068
I want you to meet
a new friend of mine, Vivian Ward.

1006
01:10:07,152 --> 01:10:10,071
Well, hi. Philip Stuckey, Vivian.
This is my wife, Elizabeth.

1007
01:10:10,155 --> 01:10:13,199
It's always a pleasure meeting
one of Edward's girls.

1008
01:10:13,283 --> 01:10:15,618
Oh, my God!
It's Tate Whitley Wallington.

1009
01:10:15,702 --> 01:10:18,872
Tate! It's me, Elizabeth,
from Workout World.

1010
01:10:20,457 --> 01:10:24,210
Sort of an aerobics queen.
Feel the burns.

1011
01:10:24,294 --> 01:10:27,338
Well, let me get you something to drink.
Vivian, why don't you start with that. Okay?

1012
01:10:27,380 --> 01:10:30,008
I'll be right back. Did you notice
Senator Adams is here?

1013
01:10:30,049 --> 01:10:32,051
Mm-hmm. I asked him.

1014
01:10:32,135 --> 01:10:36,681
That is why I have pledged
my eternal love to you. Mmm!

1015
01:10:36,723 --> 01:10:40,310
Real genuine guy.
Who is he?

1016
01:10:40,393 --> 01:10:42,395
He's my lawyer.
He's all right.

1017
01:10:42,479 --> 01:10:44,397
You could freeze ice
on his wife's ass.

1018
01:10:44,481 --> 01:10:46,399
Maybe we'll try that later.

1019
01:10:46,483 --> 01:10:50,028
- Are these people your friends?
- I spend time with them, yeah.

1020
01:10:50,111 --> 01:10:53,823
- Well, no wonder.
- No wonder what?

1021
01:10:53,907 --> 01:10:56,868
No wonder why
you came looking for me.

1022
01:10:56,910 --> 01:11:00,121
And I do need some help from you
ladies and gentlemen in the audience.

1023
01:11:00,205 --> 01:11:04,042
We need you to help replace some of
the divots out here on the grass.

1024
01:11:04,084 --> 01:11:06,920
- So come on out now.
Come on! Come on, folks.

1025
01:11:07,003 --> 01:11:09,380
You heard her.
The stomping of the divots.

1026
01:11:09,422 --> 01:11:12,092
This is a time-honored tradition,
ladies and gentlemen.

1027
01:11:12,175 --> 01:11:17,138
As old as the game of polo itself.
Kings and queens used to do this.

1028
01:11:18,681 --> 01:11:21,059
She's sweet, Edward.

1029
01:11:21,101 --> 01:11:23,353
Wherever did you find her?

1030
01:11:23,436 --> 01:11:26,147
976-BABE.

1031
01:11:28,691 --> 01:11:33,696
Only one word
of advice: Avoid the steaming divot!

1032
01:11:40,036 --> 01:11:42,872
No, it's all part
of the game of polo.

1033
01:11:42,956 --> 01:11:45,333
You get to have your shoes
polished by a member of the club.

1034
01:11:45,417 --> 01:11:47,335
I think I got something in the car
that will buff that up.

1035
01:11:47,419 --> 01:11:49,337
Thank you.

1036
01:11:49,421 --> 01:11:54,134
- Vivian, hi. David Morse.
- Excuse me.

1037
01:11:54,217 --> 01:11:56,136
- David.
- How are ya?

1038
01:11:56,219 --> 01:11:58,763
- I'm okay.
- I thought that was you. I like this hat.

1039
01:11:58,847 --> 01:12:02,809
- It's new. Yeah?
Yeah. Thanks.

1040
01:12:01,823 --> 01:12:05,160
- Come meet my horse, Vivian.
- Well, Edward's waiting for me.

1041
01:12:05,243 --> 01:12:08,121
- He's right here.
- Okay, I'll- Just for a second, though.

1042
01:12:08,163 --> 01:12:10,081
I didn't know
you were playing today.

1043
01:12:10,165 --> 01:12:13,585
Uh, I was asking for directions.
There she was.

1044
01:12:13,668 --> 01:12:16,379
Oh, so you just ran into her?
That's great. Jesus.

1045
01:12:16,463 --> 01:12:20,717
So anyway, what does she do?
Does she work?

1046
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:23,928
- She's in sales.
- Sales? That's terrific. That's good.

1047
01:12:24,012 --> 01:12:25,930
What does she sell?

1048
01:12:27,432 --> 01:12:29,350
Why do you want to know?

1049
01:12:31,019 --> 01:12:33,938
Just hear me out on this.
I've known you a long time.

1050
01:12:34,022 --> 01:12:38,777
I see some differences in you this week,
like the tie, and, uh-

1051
01:12:38,860 --> 01:12:41,196
I'm wondering if maybe
this girl isn't the difference,

1052
01:12:41,237 --> 01:12:44,532
especially when I see her
talking to David Morse.

1053
01:12:48,244 --> 01:12:50,914
- I introduced them at dinner the other night.
- So what?

1054
01:12:50,997 --> 01:12:53,917
Now they're best friends?
This girl appears out of nowhere.

1055
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:57,337
Now she's talking to a guy whose company we're
trying to buy. Convenient, don't you think?

1056
01:12:57,378 --> 01:13:00,298
- Don't be ridiculous.
- How do you know that this girl...

1057
01:13:00,381 --> 01:13:03,301
hasn't attached herself to you because
she's bringing information back to Morse?

1058
01:13:03,384 --> 01:13:05,678
- This happens! Industrial espionage-
- Phil, Phil, Phil!

1059
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:07,889
- Phil, listen to me.
- What?

1060
01:13:07,972 --> 01:13:11,976
- She's not a spy. She is a hooker.
- Oh!

1061
01:13:12,060 --> 01:13:13,978
She is a hooker.

1062
01:13:15,772 --> 01:13:18,108
I picked her up
on Hollywood Boulevard.

1063
01:13:18,191 --> 01:13:20,110
In your car.

1064
01:13:24,572 --> 01:13:26,699
- Oh, you are-
- Yes, yes.

1065
01:13:26,741 --> 01:13:28,910
Oh, man!

1066
01:13:28,993 --> 01:13:32,080
You're the only millionaire
I ever heard of...

1067
01:13:32,163 --> 01:13:35,875
who goes looking for a bargain basement
streetwalker, you know?

1068
01:13:35,959 --> 01:13:38,420
- Edward!
- I'm sorry I told you.

1069
01:13:38,461 --> 01:13:42,173
Senator. Senator Adams,
I'm pleased you could make it.

1070
01:13:42,257 --> 01:13:44,676
Thank you. I hope the information
I gave you was helpful.

1071
01:13:44,759 --> 01:13:47,137
Oh, absolutely, yes, and thank you
for it. There's no change, is there?

1072
01:13:47,220 --> 01:13:49,264
No, it's still bogged down.

1073
01:13:52,267 --> 01:13:55,895
- Having a nice time, Vivian?
- Yeah, I'm having a great time.

1074
01:13:55,979 --> 01:13:58,898
Must be quite a change
from Hollywood Boulevard, hmm?

1075
01:14:00,608 --> 01:14:02,569
What?

1076
01:14:02,610 --> 01:14:04,612
Yeah, Edward told me.

1077
01:14:04,696 --> 01:14:08,616
But don't worry;
you're secret is safe with me.

1078
01:14:08,658 --> 01:14:12,996
Listen, maybe, uh, you and I could
get together sometime...

1079
01:14:13,079 --> 01:14:14,998
after Edward leaves.

1080
01:14:16,458 --> 01:14:18,960
Yeah, sure. Why not?

1081
01:14:20,044 --> 01:14:22,464
We'll just
have to do that, hmm?

1082
01:14:22,547 --> 01:14:24,466
Philip.

1083
01:14:26,509 --> 01:14:28,470
Hi, tailgaters.

1084
01:14:28,511 --> 01:14:30,805
I'd like to mention a couple
of our silver sponsors:

1085
01:14:30,889 --> 01:14:33,433
Jacobs Distributors,
Norrell Saddlery,

1086
01:14:33,475 --> 01:14:37,270
and we'd like to give a great big thanks
to our platinum sponsor,

1087
01:14:37,312 --> 01:14:41,149
Edward Lewis Enterprises.

1088
01:14:41,191 --> 01:14:44,027
The ball is in for chukker number four.

1089
01:14:52,702 --> 01:14:55,413
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

1090
01:14:55,455 --> 01:14:59,751
Fine. That's good.
Seven "fines" since we left the match.

1091
01:14:59,793 --> 01:15:01,753
Could I have
another word, please?

1092
01:15:01,795 --> 01:15:03,755
Asshole! There's a word.

1093
01:15:05,215 --> 01:15:07,133
I think I liked "fine" better.

1094
01:15:07,217 --> 01:15:11,513
You know what? Just tell me one thing:
Why did you make me get all dressed up?

1095
01:15:11,596 --> 01:15:14,015
Well, for one thing,
the clothing was appropriate.

1096
01:15:14,099 --> 01:15:17,852
No, what I mean is, if you
were gonna tell everybody I'm a hooker,

1097
01:15:17,936 --> 01:15:20,522
- why didn't you just let me wear my own
clothes, okay? - I did not- I did not-

1098
01:15:20,605 --> 01:15:23,566
I mean, in my own clothes, when someone
like that guy Stuckey comes up to me,

1099
01:15:23,650 --> 01:15:26,403
I can handle it;
I'm prepared.

1100
01:15:26,486 --> 01:15:31,366
I'm very sorry. I'm not happy with
Stuckey at all for saying or doing that.

1101
01:15:31,449 --> 01:15:34,536
But he is my attorney.
I've known him for ten years.

1102
01:15:34,619 --> 01:15:38,164
He thought you were some kind of
industrial spy. The guy's paranoid.

1103
01:15:38,248 --> 01:15:41,292
Are you my pimp now? You think you
can pass me around to your friends?

1104
01:15:41,376 --> 01:15:45,338
- I'm not some little toy!
- Look, I know you're not my toy. Vivian!

1105
01:15:45,422 --> 01:15:48,258
Vivian, I'm speaking to you.
Come back here!

1106
01:15:48,341 --> 01:15:50,969
I hate to point out the obvious,
but you are, in fact, a hooker!

1107
01:15:51,052 --> 01:15:53,805
- And you are my employee!
- Look, you don't own me. I decide, okay?

1108
01:15:53,847 --> 01:15:56,808
I say who; I say when;
I- I say who-

1109
01:15:56,850 --> 01:16:00,478
I refuse to spend the next three days fighting
with you. I said I was sorry. I meant it.

1110
01:16:00,520 --> 01:16:03,231
That's the end of it!

1111
01:16:03,314 --> 01:16:05,233
I'm sorry I ever met you.

1112
01:16:06,901 --> 01:16:08,987
I'm sorry I ever
got into your stupid car!

1113
01:16:09,070 --> 01:16:12,157
As if you had so many more
appealing options.

1114
01:16:13,742 --> 01:16:18,705
I've never had anyone
make me feel as cheap as you did today.

1115
01:16:18,747 --> 01:16:21,791
Somehow, I find that
very hard to believe.

1116
01:16:29,215 --> 01:16:31,176
Where are you going?

1117
01:16:31,217 --> 01:16:34,679
I want my money.
I want to get out of here.

1118
01:17:20,725 --> 01:17:22,644
Come on!

1119
01:17:34,906 --> 01:17:36,825
I'm sorry.

1120
01:17:38,576 --> 01:17:42,497
I wasn't prepared
to answer questions about us.

1121
01:17:44,582 --> 01:17:48,044
It was stupid and cruel.

1122
01:17:48,128 --> 01:17:50,046
I didn't mean it.

1123
01:17:50,130 --> 01:17:53,425
I don't want you to go.

1124
01:17:53,466 --> 01:17:57,387
- Will you stay the week?
- Why?

1125
01:17:59,347 --> 01:18:04,394
I saw you talking to David Morse;
I didn't like it.

1126
01:18:04,477 --> 01:18:06,813
We were just talking.

1127
01:18:10,358 --> 01:18:12,360
I didn't like it.

1128
01:18:15,155 --> 01:18:17,699
Down?

1129
01:18:29,669 --> 01:18:31,588
You hurt me.

1130
01:18:32,839 --> 01:18:34,799
Yes.

1131
01:18:36,426 --> 01:18:38,636
Don't do it again.

1132
01:19:00,950 --> 01:19:05,038
First guy I ever loved
was a total nothing.

1133
01:19:05,121 --> 01:19:07,040
Second was worse.

1134
01:19:07,123 --> 01:19:09,042
My mom called me
a bum magnet.

1135
01:19:09,125 --> 01:19:13,797
If there was a bum within a 50-mile
radius, I was completely attracted to him.

1136
01:19:13,880 --> 01:19:17,133
That's how I ended up here.
I followed bum number three.

1137
01:19:17,217 --> 01:19:19,135
Oh.

1138
01:19:19,219 --> 01:19:22,972
So here I was: no money,
no friends, no bum.

1139
01:19:25,141 --> 01:19:28,895
And you chose this as your profession?

1140
01:19:30,563 --> 01:19:33,691
I worked at a couple
fast food places,

1141
01:19:33,775 --> 01:19:36,861
parked cars at wrestling.

1142
01:19:36,903 --> 01:19:40,824
And I couldn't make the rent.
I was too ashamed to go home.

1143
01:19:40,907 --> 01:19:43,034
That's when I met Kit.

1144
01:19:43,076 --> 01:19:46,037
She was a hooker
and made it sound so great.

1145
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:49,040
So one day I did it.

1146
01:19:50,875 --> 01:19:53,044
I cried the whole time.

1147
01:19:55,630 --> 01:19:58,383
But then I got some regulars
and, you know-

1148
01:19:58,425 --> 01:20:02,887
It's not like anybody plans this;
it's not your childhood dream.

1149
01:20:06,683 --> 01:20:09,102
You could be
so much more.

1150
01:20:11,771 --> 01:20:15,734
People put you down enough,
you start to believe it.

1151
01:20:17,694 --> 01:20:23,116
I think you are a very bright,
very special woman.

1152
01:20:24,534 --> 01:20:28,246
The bad stuff
is easier to believe.

1153
01:20:28,329 --> 01:20:30,790
You ever notice that?

1154
01:20:39,924 --> 01:20:42,844
- Tell him I'll call him on Monday.
- Yes, sir.

1155
01:20:42,927 --> 01:20:45,847
- Where you going? Did he sign these?
- No, he said he had to leave.

1156
01:20:45,930 --> 01:20:48,975
- Edward, you can't disappear now. We're in this too deep.
- Don't panic, Philip.

1157
01:20:49,058 --> 01:20:51,519
Morse isn't going anywhere.
I'll be back here in the morning.

1158
01:20:51,603 --> 01:20:53,688
- Did you send the tickets to the hotel? Thank you.
- Yes, sir.

1159
01:20:53,772 --> 01:20:55,690
- Where are you going?
- I have a date.

1160
01:20:55,774 --> 01:20:57,692
With the hooker?

1161
01:21:01,571 --> 01:21:03,490
Be careful, Philip.

1162
01:21:24,886 --> 01:21:26,805
- Do I look okay?
- Mmm.

1163
01:21:26,888 --> 01:21:29,474
- Mmm?
- Something's missing.

1164
01:21:29,557 --> 01:21:33,561
Well, nothin' else is gonna fit
into this dress. I'll tell ya that.

1165
01:21:33,645 --> 01:21:35,563
Well, maybe
something in this box.

1166
01:21:35,647 --> 01:21:39,609
I don't want you to get too excited.
This is only on loan.

1167
01:21:45,323 --> 01:21:47,617
Oh!

1168
01:21:47,659 --> 01:21:51,121
They really let you borrow this
from the jewelry store?

1169
01:21:51,162 --> 01:21:53,832
I'm a very good customer.

1170
01:21:53,915 --> 01:21:56,167
If you were gonna buy this,
how much would it cost?

1171
01:21:56,251 --> 01:21:58,962
Quarter of a million.

1172
01:21:59,045 --> 01:22:01,005
A quarter
of a million dollars?

1173
01:22:06,678 --> 01:22:09,013
So, where we goin'?

1174
01:22:09,055 --> 01:22:11,015
It's a surprise.

1175
01:22:13,393 --> 01:22:17,856
If I forget to tell you later,
I had a really good time tonight.

1176
01:22:17,897 --> 01:22:19,649
Thank you.

1177
01:22:39,294 --> 01:22:42,088
When you're not fidgeting,
you look very beautiful...

1178
01:22:42,172 --> 01:22:44,048
and very tall.

1179
01:22:44,132 --> 01:22:48,428
# You're a dream
coming true #

1180
01:22:48,511 --> 01:22:51,431
# I can't believe how I have #

1181
01:22:51,514 --> 01:22:54,058
# Fallen for you #

1182
01:22:56,186 --> 01:22:59,230
# You are the one #

1183
01:22:59,314 --> 01:23:04,319
# Who's led me to the sun #

1184
01:23:04,402 --> 01:23:08,031
- # How could I know #
- You don't want to go to San Francisco in a limousine?

1185
01:23:08,114 --> 01:23:12,077
- # I was lost without you #
- I've never been on a plane before.

1186
01:23:12,118 --> 01:23:15,705
# And I want to tell you #

1187
01:23:15,747 --> 01:23:19,209
# You control my brain #

1188
01:23:21,044 --> 01:23:23,546
# And you should know that #

1189
01:23:23,630 --> 01:23:27,092
# You are life in my veins ##

1190
01:23:27,175 --> 01:23:29,469
Well, it should
be a pretty smooth flight, Mr. Lewis.

1191
01:23:29,552 --> 01:23:31,554
The weather is clear
all the way up to San Francisco.

1192
01:23:31,638 --> 01:23:34,599
We should be there
in about 50 minutes.

1193
01:23:45,777 --> 01:23:48,905
- We're late.
- No, it's all right.

1194
01:23:48,988 --> 01:23:53,118
- Opening night never starts on time.
- Okay.

1195
01:23:53,201 --> 01:23:55,120
- Program, sir.
- Thank you.

1196
01:23:58,748 --> 01:24:00,667
How nice to meet you.

1197
01:24:04,295 --> 01:24:06,714
Right this way,
Mr. Lewis, sir.

1198
01:24:11,219 --> 01:24:14,055
- Doris, how nice to see you.
- How are you?

1199
01:24:14,139 --> 01:24:16,474
- Sir. Wonderful news. Congratulations.
- Good evening, Edward.

1200
01:24:16,558 --> 01:24:18,810
- Hey, come here. You gotta look at this.
- It's all right.

1201
01:24:18,893 --> 01:24:23,606
- I've already seen it.
- If you're afraid of heights, why do you get seats up here?

1202
01:24:23,690 --> 01:24:26,025
Because they're the best.

1203
01:24:26,109 --> 01:24:28,278
- Is there anything else, sir?
- No, thank you.

1204
01:24:28,319 --> 01:24:32,157
- The glasses are there. Enjoy the opera.
- Oh!

1205
01:24:32,198 --> 01:24:35,660
- So, you said this is in Italian.
- Uh-huh.

1206
01:24:35,744 --> 01:24:38,872
So how am I gonna know what
they're singin'? These are broken.

1207
01:24:38,955 --> 01:24:42,459
- Mine are broken.
- No, no. That's okay It's all right.

1208
01:24:42,500 --> 01:24:45,462
- Oh.
- You'll know. Believe me, you'll understand.

1209
01:24:45,503 --> 01:24:47,464
The music's very powerful.

1210
01:24:50,550 --> 01:24:52,677
There's a band!

1211
01:24:54,846 --> 01:24:58,933
People's reactions to opera the first
time they see it is very dramatic.

1212
01:24:59,017 --> 01:25:01,853
They either love it
or they hate it.

1213
01:25:01,936 --> 01:25:04,856
If they love it,
they will always love it.

1214
01:25:04,939 --> 01:25:07,859
If they don't,
they may learn to appreciate it,

1215
01:25:07,942 --> 01:25:12,030
but it will never
become part of their soul.

1216
01:25:12,113 --> 01:25:15,033
- Mmm.
- ##

1217
01:27:07,187 --> 01:27:12,275
- Did you enjoy the opera, dear?
- Oh, it was so good, I almost peed in my pants.

1218
01:27:12,358 --> 01:27:14,360
What?

1219
01:27:14,444 --> 01:27:18,364
She said she liked it better
than Pirates of Penzance.

1220
01:27:18,448 --> 01:27:20,366
- Oh!
- Yes.

1221
01:27:20,450 --> 01:27:22,368
Good-bye now.

1222
01:27:28,208 --> 01:27:30,293
- No, don't touch-
- I moved the queen. I like the queen.

1223
01:27:30,335 --> 01:27:32,504
You can't move the queen.

1224
01:27:32,629 --> 01:27:34,422
Did you really do that?

1225
01:27:36,508 --> 01:27:41,346
Why don't we finish this tomorrow?
It's really late, and I have to work.

1226
01:27:41,429 --> 01:27:45,767
Why don't you not go to work tomorrow.
Take the day off.

1227
01:27:45,809 --> 01:27:48,686
- Me, not work?
- Yeah.

1228
01:27:52,148 --> 01:27:54,109
I do own the company.

1229
01:28:06,121 --> 01:28:09,791
Here are the storage reports you wanted,
and Mr. Lewis called.

1230
01:28:09,833 --> 01:28:13,962
- What'd he say?
- He said he's taking the day off.

1231
01:28:14,003 --> 01:28:16,840
- He's taking the day off?
- That's what he said.

1232
01:28:19,634 --> 01:28:24,222
I'm starving. There's a snap dog vendor
over there. Do you have any money?

1233
01:28:24,305 --> 01:28:26,641
I have money. I don't know what
a snap dog is, but I have money.

1234
01:28:26,683 --> 01:28:30,395
Well, I'm gonna give, um
- you'll buy a snap dog; we'll cop a squat under a tree somewhere.

1235
01:28:30,478 --> 01:28:32,397
- Cop a what?
- Cop a squat.

1236
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:35,400
All right,
read the first two pages.

1237
01:28:35,483 --> 01:28:37,277
Okay.

1238
01:28:38,361 --> 01:28:40,280
Mmm.

1239
01:28:42,323 --> 01:28:44,951
I was talking to someone.

1240
01:29:23,661 --> 01:29:25,830
He sleeps.

1241
01:31:56,272 --> 01:31:58,232
I love you.

1242
01:32:09,326 --> 01:32:12,246
What are you thinkin' about
sittin' here all by yourself?

1243
01:32:12,329 --> 01:32:17,334
The fact that this will be our last night
together, and you'll finally be rid of me.

1244
01:32:17,418 --> 01:32:20,963
Well, you've been pretty tough to take.

1245
01:32:21,046 --> 01:32:24,467
My business is almost over,
so I'll be going back to New York.

1246
01:32:28,637 --> 01:32:31,223
I'd really like
to see you again.

1247
01:32:31,265 --> 01:32:33,642
- You would?
- Yes.

1248
01:32:33,726 --> 01:32:38,397
Yes, I would, so I've arranged for you
to have an apartment, to have a car,

1249
01:32:38,439 --> 01:32:42,943
a wide variety of stores guaranteed to suck
up to you anytime you want to go shopping.

1250
01:32:43,027 --> 01:32:47,448
- Everything's done.
- What else?

1251
01:32:47,490 --> 01:32:50,409
You gonna leave some money by the bed
when you pass through town?

1252
01:32:51,494 --> 01:32:53,829
Vivian, it really
wouldn't be like that.

1253
01:32:53,913 --> 01:32:56,207
How would it be?

1254
01:32:56,290 --> 01:33:01,629
- Well, for one thing, it would get you off the streets.
- That's just geography.

1255
01:33:11,305 --> 01:33:15,226
Vivian, what is it you want?

1256
01:33:17,311 --> 01:33:20,147
What do you see
happening between us?

1257
01:33:20,189 --> 01:33:22,483
I don't know.

1258
01:33:26,112 --> 01:33:29,115
When I was a little girl,

1259
01:33:29,198 --> 01:33:34,495
my mama used to lock me in the attic
when I was bad, which was pretty often.

1260
01:33:34,537 --> 01:33:38,707
And I would- I would
pretend I was a princess...

1261
01:33:38,791 --> 01:33:41,419
trapped in a tower
by a wicked queen.

1262
01:33:41,502 --> 01:33:45,923
And then suddenly
this knight...

1263
01:33:46,006 --> 01:33:51,679
on a white horse with these colors flying
would come charging up and draw his sword.

1264
01:33:51,720 --> 01:33:53,973
And I would wave.

1265
01:33:54,014 --> 01:33:58,144
And he would climb up the tower
and rescue me.

1266
01:34:01,897 --> 01:34:03,899
But never in all the time...

1267
01:34:03,983 --> 01:34:08,863
that I had this dream
did the knight say to me,

1268
01:34:08,904 --> 01:34:12,324
"Come on, baby, I'll put you up
in a great condo. "

1269
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:22,918
- Yes.
- I had to call.

1270
01:34:23,002 --> 01:34:25,421
I just got off the phone
with James Morse. Get this.

1271
01:34:25,504 --> 01:34:27,923
- He wants to meet with you today.
- What about?

1272
01:34:28,007 --> 01:34:31,594
He wouldn't say. Edward, I think we
got him. His nuts are on the block.

1273
01:34:31,677 --> 01:34:33,596
We got him!

1274
01:34:33,679 --> 01:34:37,391
Look, if he's really caving in, I want to get
him to commit his stocks to us this afternoon.

1275
01:34:37,475 --> 01:34:40,603
No, it's no good. If he's really caving in,
I don't want to wait 'til this afternoon.

1276
01:34:40,686 --> 01:34:43,606
Have Morse meet me downtown
this morning. Good-bye.

1277
01:34:51,572 --> 01:34:54,408
I have to go now,

1278
01:34:54,492 --> 01:34:58,287
but I want you to understand...

1279
01:34:58,370 --> 01:35:00,289
I heard everything you said.

1280
01:35:01,749 --> 01:35:04,919
This is all
I'm capable of right now.

1281
01:35:05,002 --> 01:35:06,921
It's a very big step for me.

1282
01:35:08,672 --> 01:35:13,094
I know. It's a really good offer
for a girl like me.

1283
01:35:15,304 --> 01:35:17,765
I've never treated you
like a prostitute.

1284
01:35:24,438 --> 01:35:26,357
You just did.

1285
01:35:28,442 --> 01:35:31,904
It's Barnard Thompson here,
Miss Vivian.

1286
01:35:31,946 --> 01:35:35,825
Could you come down to the front desk?
There's someone here who wants to speak to you.

1287
01:35:35,908 --> 01:35:38,411
- She says her name is Miss De Luca-
- Let me talk to her.

1288
01:35:38,494 --> 01:35:41,789
Let me-
Let me just talk to her.

1289
01:35:41,872 --> 01:35:46,794
Yo, Viv, babe. Would you come down here?
The sphincter police won't let me through.

1290
01:35:46,836 --> 01:35:49,422
- Okay. She's on her way.
- Fine.

1291
01:35:49,505 --> 01:35:51,465
- Mr. Thompson.
- Yes.

1292
01:35:51,507 --> 01:35:54,301
The window washer
is refusing to come down.

1293
01:35:54,385 --> 01:35:56,470
It's a Saturday.
Wait here, please.

1294
01:35:56,554 --> 01:35:58,973
- Watch her.
- Yes, sir.

1295
01:36:10,443 --> 01:36:15,573
Fifty bucks, Grandpa.
For 75, the wife can watch.

1296
01:36:19,410 --> 01:36:21,245
Listen, I've been calling you.

1297
01:36:21,328 --> 01:36:23,664
Yeah, I know. They told me
at the Banana you were lookin' for me.

1298
01:36:23,706 --> 01:36:25,708
You were supposed to come by Tuesday.
I left the money at the desk.

1299
01:36:25,791 --> 01:36:28,002
- I was hidin' from Carlos.
- Well, if you picked up the money,

1300
01:36:28,043 --> 01:36:31,672
- you wouldn't have to hide.
- I was busy. I had a life. Nino got beat up.

1301
01:36:31,756 --> 01:36:35,301
We had to visit him in the hospital,
Rachel got arrested. It was a mess.

1302
01:36:35,342 --> 01:36:39,638
Anyway, I got the money. Thank you very much
for saving my ass. Now Carlos can get off of it.

1303
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:42,183
You know, he was talkin'
about you last night.

1304
01:36:42,224 --> 01:36:44,185
He would bust somethin'
if he saw you in this outfit.

1305
01:36:44,226 --> 01:36:48,481
I was afraid to hug you up there.
I might wrinkle you!

1306
01:36:48,522 --> 01:36:53,110
- You look really good. No, something in the shade.
- Over there.

1307
01:36:53,194 --> 01:36:55,821
You clean up real nice.

1308
01:36:55,863 --> 01:36:59,241
You sure don't fit in down on the Boulevard
lookin' like you do, not that you ever did.

1309
01:36:59,325 --> 01:37:02,828
Well, thanks, but it's easy
to clean up when you got money.

1310
01:37:02,870 --> 01:37:05,790
Yeah.

1311
01:37:05,873 --> 01:37:09,502
- So, when does he leave?
- Tomorrow.

1312
01:37:09,543 --> 01:37:13,172
- You get to keep the clothes?
- Yeah.

1313
01:37:13,255 --> 01:37:18,719
Edward asked me
if I wanted to see him again.

1314
01:37:18,761 --> 01:37:23,349
But I think, I think definitely no.
It's just another week, right?

1315
01:37:23,390 --> 01:37:26,435
- "Definitely no. "
- Yeah.

1316
01:37:26,519 --> 01:37:28,729
Oh, no.

1317
01:37:28,813 --> 01:37:30,731
What?

1318
01:37:30,815 --> 01:37:33,859
- I know this weepy look on your face.
- Oh, no, you don't!

1319
01:37:33,901 --> 01:37:36,445
- You fell in love with him.
- No. Kit, please. Stop it.

1320
01:37:36,529 --> 01:37:38,447
- You've fallen in love with him?
- Kit!

1321
01:37:38,531 --> 01:37:41,617
- Did you kiss him? On the mouth?
- Uh, yeah, I did.

1322
01:37:41,700 --> 01:37:43,619
- You kissed him on the mouth?
- I did. It was nice.

1323
01:37:43,702 --> 01:37:46,705
You fall in love with him, and you kiss him
on the mouth. Did I not teach you anything?

1324
01:37:46,789 --> 01:37:51,127
Look, I'm not stupid, okay?
I'm- I'm not in love with him.

1325
01:37:51,210 --> 01:37:53,671
I just- I like him.

1326
01:37:53,754 --> 01:37:55,714
You like him?

1327
01:37:55,756 --> 01:37:59,051
- Yeah.
- You definitely like him.

1328
01:38:00,261 --> 01:38:03,097
Well, he's not a bum.
He's a rich, classy guy.

1329
01:38:03,139 --> 01:38:06,225
- Who's gonna break my heart, right?
- Oh, no. Come on.

1330
01:38:06,308 --> 01:38:08,602
You don't know that.
Hey, he asked you, right?

1331
01:38:08,644 --> 01:38:11,939
Maybe you guys could, like, um,
you know, get a house together.

1332
01:38:11,981 --> 01:38:14,066
Like, buy some diamonds
and a horse. I don't know.

1333
01:38:14,108 --> 01:38:17,153
Anyway, it could work.
It happens.

1334
01:38:19,113 --> 01:38:21,240
When does it happen, Kit?

1335
01:38:21,282 --> 01:38:23,242
When does it really happen?
Who does it really work out for?

1336
01:38:23,284 --> 01:38:25,536
Did it work out for Skinny Marie
or Rachel? No!

1337
01:38:25,619 --> 01:38:27,955
Those were very specific cases
of crackheads.

1338
01:38:28,038 --> 01:38:30,291
I just wanna know
who it works out for.

1339
01:38:30,332 --> 01:38:33,294
You give me one example of somebody that
we know that it happened for.

1340
01:38:33,335 --> 01:38:35,296
- Name someone?
- Yeah, one person that it worked out for.

1341
01:38:35,337 --> 01:38:38,299
- You want me to give you a name or something.
- Yeah.

1342
01:38:38,340 --> 01:38:40,801
Oh, God, the pressure
of a name.

1343
01:38:43,721 --> 01:38:45,806
Cinder-fuckin'- rella.

1344
01:38:52,090 --> 01:38:55,218
Mr. Morse, you said this morning
you wished to speak to Mr. Lewis.

1345
01:38:55,301 --> 01:38:57,595
Mr. Lewis is now listening.

1346
01:38:57,678 --> 01:39:03,059
I've reconsidered my position
on your acquisition offer...

1347
01:39:03,142 --> 01:39:05,061
on one condition.

1348
01:39:05,144 --> 01:39:10,149
I'm not so concerned about me,
but the people who are working for me.

1349
01:39:10,233 --> 01:39:12,193
It's not a problem.
They'll be taken care of.

1350
01:39:12,235 --> 01:39:15,405
Well, then, gentlemen. If we could address
ourselves to the contracts in front of you.

1351
01:39:15,488 --> 01:39:18,741
- If you look at-
- Excuse me, Phil.

1352
01:39:18,825 --> 01:39:23,704
Gentlemen,
I'd like to speak to Mr. Morse alone.

1353
01:39:23,788 --> 01:39:25,665
Thank you.

1354
01:39:27,667 --> 01:39:30,378
All right, gentlemen, you heard
the man. Please wait outside.

1355
01:39:32,255 --> 01:39:34,507
You too, Phil.

1356
01:39:34,590 --> 01:39:37,427
What do you mean?

1357
01:39:37,510 --> 01:39:40,012
I mean I would like to speak
to Mr. Morse alone.

1358
01:39:41,931 --> 01:39:46,561
- Why does he get to stay?
- Please, please.

1359
01:39:50,231 --> 01:39:53,526
- I'll be right outside.
- Good.

1360
01:40:10,251 --> 01:40:12,295
- Is that better?
- It's all right.

1361
01:40:12,378 --> 01:40:16,132
- Would you like a cup of coffee?
- Black.

1362
01:40:18,259 --> 01:40:21,596
Mr. Morse,

1363
01:40:21,679 --> 01:40:24,223
my interests in your company
have changed.

1364
01:40:24,265 --> 01:40:29,103
What is it you're after now,
Mr. Lewis?

1365
01:40:29,187 --> 01:40:32,315
Well, I no longer wish to buy
your company and take it apart.

1366
01:40:32,398 --> 01:40:35,234
But I don't want anyone
else to, either.

1367
01:40:35,276 --> 01:40:39,530
And it is still
extremely vulnerable.

1368
01:40:39,614 --> 01:40:44,869
So I find myself...
in unfamiliar territory.

1369
01:40:44,952 --> 01:40:46,871
I wanna help you.

1370
01:40:46,954 --> 01:40:49,791
Why?

1371
01:40:58,174 --> 01:41:02,261
Mr. Morse, I think we can do something
very special with your company.

1372
01:41:02,345 --> 01:41:05,014
What about our Navy contracts?

1373
01:41:05,098 --> 01:41:09,977
Ah, they weren't dead. Just delayed.
I... bluffed a little bit.

1374
01:41:10,061 --> 01:41:12,105
- You're very good at it.
- Thank you very much.

1375
01:41:12,146 --> 01:41:15,775
It's my job.

1376
01:41:15,817 --> 01:41:18,528
I think we can leave the details
up to the others.

1377
01:41:18,611 --> 01:41:22,365
I find this hard to say
without sounding condescending, but...

1378
01:41:22,448 --> 01:41:26,160
I'm proud of you.

1379
01:41:27,453 --> 01:41:29,372
Thank you.

1380
01:41:31,541 --> 01:41:34,585
I think we can let in
the other suits now.

1381
01:41:36,087 --> 01:41:40,299
Let's continue the meeting.

1382
01:41:40,341 --> 01:41:42,635
Come in, gentlemen.
Sit down.

1383
01:41:42,718 --> 01:41:45,888
Edward, please,
what was this all about? Hmm?

1384
01:41:45,972 --> 01:41:49,100
It's all yours, Phil.
Finish it up.

1385
01:41:51,978 --> 01:41:54,564
Hold it. Hold it.
These aren't signed!

1386
01:41:54,647 --> 01:41:58,317
These aren't signed! Could someone please
tell me what the fuck is going on here?

1387
01:41:58,359 --> 01:42:01,904
Mr. Lewis and I are going
to build ships together.

1388
01:42:01,988 --> 01:42:04,657
Great big ships.

1389
01:42:06,909 --> 01:42:08,870
You know, I think I'm gonna
go for a walk.

1390
01:42:08,911 --> 01:42:11,998
- Just stay here for a while. I'll be back.
- Yes, sir, Mr. Lewis.

1391
01:42:34,228 --> 01:42:38,941
Well, well. Hello again.
I'm looking for Edward.

1392
01:42:39,025 --> 01:42:41,736
Edward's not here.
I thought he was with you.

1393
01:42:41,819 --> 01:42:46,616
No. Uh, Edward is definitely
not with me.

1394
01:42:48,701 --> 01:42:52,580
No, if Edward were with me-

1395
01:42:52,663 --> 01:42:57,376
When. Actually, when...
Edward was with me,

1396
01:42:57,460 --> 01:43:00,922
he didn't blow off
billion dollar deals!

1397
01:43:00,963 --> 01:43:05,676
I think that, uh, Edward's with you.
That's what I think.

1398
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:08,888
- Mind if I have a drink?
- No.

1399
01:43:08,930 --> 01:43:10,890
No, thank you.

1400
01:43:12,141 --> 01:43:15,228
Well, I'll just wait.

1401
01:43:15,311 --> 01:43:19,399
Uh, Edward will be back soon.
Any minute, he'll be home.

1402
01:43:22,068 --> 01:43:25,113
You know,

1403
01:43:25,196 --> 01:43:27,532
this is not home.

1404
01:43:27,615 --> 01:43:30,410
This is, uh,
a hotel room.

1405
01:43:30,451 --> 01:43:33,329
And, uh, you are not...

1406
01:43:33,413 --> 01:43:36,874
the little woman.

1407
01:43:36,958 --> 01:43:39,919
You're a hooker.

1408
01:43:40,002 --> 01:43:42,964
Maybe you're a very good
hooker, you know?

1409
01:43:43,005 --> 01:43:46,843
Maybe if I do you, then I wouldn't care
about losing millions of dollars.

1410
01:43:46,926 --> 01:43:49,512
Because I have to be
very honest with you.

1411
01:43:49,595 --> 01:43:52,473
Right now, Vivian, right now
I really do care. I really do.

1412
01:43:52,515 --> 01:43:56,602
And right now
I am really pissed, you know?

1413
01:43:56,644 --> 01:43:59,647
Right now I am
just freaking out.

1414
01:44:01,107 --> 01:44:03,317
So maybe if I
screw you, huh,

1415
01:44:03,401 --> 01:44:05,987
and take you to the opera, then I could
be a happy guy, just like Edward.

1416
01:44:06,070 --> 01:44:09,699
- Hey, get off me!
- Hey, hey! Goddamn it!

1417
01:44:09,782 --> 01:44:12,410
- Ow!
- Ow!

1418
01:44:12,493 --> 01:44:15,329
- Come on! Come on! I'll pay for it.
- Get off me!

1419
01:44:15,413 --> 01:44:17,415
- How much is it? Twenty bucks, thirty bucks?
- Get off me! Get off me!

1420
01:44:17,498 --> 01:44:20,293
- Fifty? You a $50 whore, Vivian?
- What are you doing?

1421
01:44:20,334 --> 01:44:23,629
- Get off!
- Stop. I don't want to hurt you! Stop it!

1422
01:44:23,671 --> 01:44:25,715
You already did,
Edward!

1423
01:44:25,798 --> 01:44:28,259
- Out. Out of here.
- All right, all right.

1424
01:44:28,342 --> 01:44:32,221
Look, she's a whore, man.
She's a goddamn- Aah!

1425
01:44:34,682 --> 01:44:38,019
- Aah! Damn.
- Shit. Goddamn!

1426
01:44:39,479 --> 01:44:41,647
- I think you broke my nose.
- Get outta here.

1427
01:44:41,689 --> 01:44:44,984
What is wrong with you? Come on,
Edward! I gave you ten years!

1428
01:44:45,068 --> 01:44:49,155
- I devoted my whole life to you!
- That's bullshit.

1429
01:44:49,197 --> 01:44:52,408
This is such bullshit!
It's the kill you love, not me!

1430
01:44:52,492 --> 01:44:55,661
I made you a very rich man
doing exactly what you loved.

1431
01:44:55,745 --> 01:44:57,705
Now get outta here!

1432
01:44:59,123 --> 01:45:01,042
Get out!

1433
01:45:10,718 --> 01:45:13,721
Why do guys always know how to hit
a woman right across the cheek?

1434
01:45:13,805 --> 01:45:17,517
Wham! And it feels like
your eye is gonna explode.

1435
01:45:17,558 --> 01:45:21,229
What do they do? Do they pull you aside
in high school and show you how to do this?

1436
01:45:21,312 --> 01:45:23,231
Is that- Ow.

1437
01:45:26,984 --> 01:45:28,903
Not all guys hit.

1438
01:45:31,781 --> 01:45:34,742
I heard about
what you did with Morse.

1439
01:45:36,285 --> 01:45:39,747
- That was a business decision.
- It was good.

1440
01:45:41,124 --> 01:45:43,543
It felt good.

1441
01:45:46,462 --> 01:45:49,298
I think this is okay.

1442
01:45:49,382 --> 01:45:51,259
I gotta get going.

1443
01:45:51,300 --> 01:45:53,970
Yes, I noticed you're packed.

1444
01:45:54,053 --> 01:45:56,305
Why are you leaving now?

1445
01:45:58,641 --> 01:46:02,437
Edward, there'll always be some guy,
even some friend of yours,

1446
01:46:02,520 --> 01:46:04,689
thinkin' he can treat me
like Stuckey,

1447
01:46:04,772 --> 01:46:07,316
thinking that it's allowed.

1448
01:46:07,400 --> 01:46:11,571
What are you gonna do?
You gonna beat up everybody?

1449
01:46:11,612 --> 01:46:14,657
That's not why you're leaving.

1450
01:46:15,825 --> 01:46:19,912
Look, you made me
a really nice offer.

1451
01:46:17,910 --> 01:46:19,912
Look, you made me
a really nice offer.

1452
01:46:19,996 --> 01:46:23,332
And a few months ago,
no problem.

1453
01:46:23,416 --> 01:46:26,085
But now everything is different,
and you've changed that.

1454
01:46:26,169 --> 01:46:29,964
And you can't change back.

1455
01:46:30,047 --> 01:46:31,966
I want more.

1456
01:46:33,676 --> 01:46:36,137
I know about wanting more.

1457
01:46:36,179 --> 01:46:38,973
I invented the concept.

1458
01:46:39,057 --> 01:46:42,602
The question is how much more.

1459
01:46:44,187 --> 01:46:46,147
I want the fairy tale.

1460
01:46:48,232 --> 01:46:50,151
Impossible relationships.

1461
01:46:52,320 --> 01:46:57,241
My special gift is
impossible relationships.

1462
01:47:09,712 --> 01:47:13,800
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1463
01:47:15,551 --> 01:47:21,099
If you ever need anything- dental
floss, whatever- you give me a call.

1464
01:47:25,144 --> 01:47:27,313
I had a good time.

1465
01:47:27,397 --> 01:47:29,315
Me too.

1466
01:47:39,742 --> 01:47:41,869
Do you want me
to get you a bellboy?

1467
01:47:41,953 --> 01:47:44,997
- No, I got it.
- I'll carry this.

1468
01:47:45,081 --> 01:47:47,041
Thanks.

1469
01:47:53,714 --> 01:47:57,385
Stay. Stay the night with me.

1470
01:47:57,468 --> 01:48:00,596
And not because I'm paying you,
but because you want to.

1471
01:48:05,977 --> 01:48:08,438
I can't.

1472
01:48:14,902 --> 01:48:16,821
Good-bye.

1473
01:48:23,661 --> 01:48:27,665
I think you have
a lot of special gifts.

1474
01:48:28,750 --> 01:48:30,668
Mmm.

1475
01:48:40,094 --> 01:48:43,056
- I didn't do it, sir.
- No, no. I didn't say that.

1476
01:48:43,097 --> 01:48:46,476
I want you to call maintenance and have them
deal with this. You must delegate authority.

1477
01:48:46,559 --> 01:48:48,561
- Yes, sir.
- Hi, Barney.

1478
01:48:49,854 --> 01:48:53,107
Miss Vivian. Thank you.

1479
01:48:54,150 --> 01:48:56,110
I wanted to say good-bye.

1480
01:48:56,152 --> 01:48:59,113
Well, then, I gather you're not
accompanying Mr. Lewis to New York.

1481
01:48:59,197 --> 01:49:04,035
Come on, Barney. You and me live
in the real world... most of the time.

1482
01:49:05,369 --> 01:49:07,288
Have you arranged
for transportation?

1483
01:49:07,371 --> 01:49:09,290
- I'm gonna call a cab.
- Allow me.

1484
01:49:09,373 --> 01:49:11,793
- Darryl.
- Yes, sir.

1485
01:49:11,834 --> 01:49:14,921
Please take Miss Vivian
anywhere she wishes to go.

1486
01:49:14,962 --> 01:49:16,923
Yes, sir.

1487
01:49:23,346 --> 01:49:25,306
It's been a pleasure
knowing you.

1488
01:49:25,348 --> 01:49:28,184
Come and visit us again
sometime.

1489
01:49:29,936 --> 01:49:31,854
Stay cool.

1490
01:49:44,325 --> 01:49:47,286
# Lay a whisper #

1491
01:49:47,370 --> 01:49:50,456
# On my pillow #

1492
01:49:50,540 --> 01:49:53,584
# Leave the winter #

1493
01:49:53,668 --> 01:49:56,337
# On the ground #

1494
01:49:56,421 --> 01:49:59,257
# I wake up lonely #

1495
01:49:59,340 --> 01:50:02,427
# The stare of silence #

1496
01:50:02,510 --> 01:50:05,346
# In the bedroom #

1497
01:50:05,430 --> 01:50:08,558
# And all around #

1498
01:50:08,641 --> 01:50:11,352
# Touch me now #

1499
01:50:11,394 --> 01:50:14,355
# I close my eyes #

1500
01:50:14,439 --> 01:50:17,692
# And dream away #

1501
01:50:19,819 --> 01:50:22,488
# It must have been love #

1502
01:50:22,572 --> 01:50:25,783
# But it's over now #

1503
01:50:25,867 --> 01:50:28,536
# It must have been good #

1504
01:50:28,578 --> 01:50:31,581
# But I lost it somehow #

1505
01:50:31,664 --> 01:50:34,459
# It must have been love #

1506
01:50:34,542 --> 01:50:37,712
# But it's over now #

1507
01:50:37,795 --> 01:50:40,089
# From the moment we touched #

1508
01:50:40,173 --> 01:50:43,676
# 'Til the time had run out ##

1509
01:51:01,194 --> 01:51:03,112
Is that everything, sir?

1510
01:51:03,196 --> 01:51:05,198
Yes. Yes, that's everything.

1511
01:51:05,281 --> 01:51:07,575
- I'll meet you downstairs, sir.
- Thank you.

1512
01:51:10,369 --> 01:51:12,997
We look so dopey.

1513
01:51:14,207 --> 01:51:17,418
San Francisco's not
that great, you know.

1514
01:51:17,502 --> 01:51:21,506
It's bad climate. It's foggy.
It's unpredictable.

1515
01:51:21,589 --> 01:51:23,633
I'll wear a sweater.

1516
01:51:23,716 --> 01:51:25,843
What are you gonna do there?

1517
01:51:25,927 --> 01:51:28,471
Get a job.
Finish high school.

1518
01:51:28,554 --> 01:51:32,141
I got things I can do. I used to make
pretty good grades in high school.

1519
01:51:32,225 --> 01:51:35,186
Yeah, I could see that about you.
I could see that.

1520
01:51:39,315 --> 01:51:41,859
Sure you won't come with me?

1521
01:51:41,943 --> 01:51:44,612
And leave all this?
Not in a million.

1522
01:51:46,030 --> 01:51:48,157
Come here.

1523
01:51:52,578 --> 01:51:55,456
Whoa. Whoa. What is this?

1524
01:51:56,916 --> 01:52:00,128
It's part of the Edward Lewis
scholarship fund.

1525
01:52:00,169 --> 01:52:02,839
We think you got a lot
of potential, Kit De Luca.

1526
01:52:02,922 --> 01:52:07,635
You do? You think
I got potential?

1527
01:52:07,677 --> 01:52:11,848
Oh, yeah. Don't let anybody
tell you different, okay?

1528
01:52:11,931 --> 01:52:14,392
Okay.

1529
01:52:14,475 --> 01:52:16,436
Take care of you.

1530
01:52:16,519 --> 01:52:19,063
No, I can't, I can't.
It's your favorite.

1531
01:52:21,107 --> 01:52:23,651
What time's your bus?

1532
01:52:23,735 --> 01:52:25,737
An hour.

1533
01:52:25,820 --> 01:52:28,573
Yeah, well, I gotta split,
'cause good-byes make me crazy.

1534
01:52:28,656 --> 01:52:32,827
- So, take care of you.
- Whoa.

1535
01:52:36,622 --> 01:52:38,541
Mr. Lewis.

1536
01:52:38,624 --> 01:52:41,335
You don't have
any messages for me, do you?

1537
01:52:41,419 --> 01:52:43,880
No, I'm afraid not, sir.

1538
01:52:46,340 --> 01:52:48,426
I'll need a car
to the airport also.

1539
01:52:48,509 --> 01:52:51,095
Of course. Darryl will take you
wherever you need to go.

1540
01:52:51,179 --> 01:52:53,389
- Darryl, the limousine out front, please?
- Yes, sir.

1541
01:52:53,473 --> 01:52:56,184
Thank you, Darryl.

1542
01:52:57,769 --> 01:52:59,687
- One last thing. If you could possibly...
- Yes.

1543
01:52:59,771 --> 01:53:02,857
- return this to Fred's for me, please.
- Yes, of course.

1544
01:53:02,940 --> 01:53:05,109
May I, sir?

1545
01:53:05,193 --> 01:53:07,695
Of course, please.

1546
01:53:14,994 --> 01:53:17,997
It must be difficult
to let go of something so beautiful.

1547
01:53:20,208 --> 01:53:24,670
You know, Darryl also drove
Miss Vivian home yesterday.

1548
01:53:28,674 --> 01:53:30,593
I'll take care of it.

1549
01:53:32,095 --> 01:53:34,222
Thank you, Mr. Thompson.

1550
01:53:46,109 --> 01:53:48,778
Your plane is leaving
as scheduled, sir,

1551
01:53:48,861 --> 01:53:51,572
and you should be back
in New York on time.

1552
01:54:02,500 --> 01:54:05,420
I'm gonna have to charge
you a little more rent than Vivian...

1553
01:54:05,503 --> 01:54:07,422
because I've got this beauty course
I'm looking into.

1554
01:54:07,505 --> 01:54:09,424
I'm not gonna be there
that much, you know?

1555
01:54:09,507 --> 01:54:11,926
'Cause you can't- You just can't
turn tricks forever.

1556
01:54:12,009 --> 01:54:14,345
You gotta have a goal.
Do you have a goal?

1557
01:54:14,470 --> 01:54:16,556
Well, I always wanted
to be in the Ice Capades.

1558
01:54:16,639 --> 01:54:20,601
- Help you, love?
- There you go. Thank you very much.

1559
01:54:20,685 --> 01:54:22,937
So, you got a lot of stuff
you gotta move in?

1560
01:54:23,020 --> 01:54:25,982
No, Carlos burned most of my stuff
when I said I was movin' out.

1561
01:54:52,967 --> 01:54:54,886
Vivian!

1562
01:54:54,969 --> 01:54:57,013
Vivian.

1563
01:55:01,559 --> 01:55:05,396
Princess Vivian!
Come down!

1564
01:55:09,734 --> 01:55:12,236
- Had to be the top floor, right?
- It's the best.

1565
01:55:12,320 --> 01:55:15,073
All right.
I'm coming up.

1566
01:55:49,732 --> 01:55:54,862
So what happened after he climbed up
the tower and rescued her?

1567
01:55:54,946 --> 01:55:57,657
She rescues him right back.

1568
01:56:08,459 --> 01:56:11,671
Welcome to Hollywood.
What's your dream?

1569
01:56:11,754 --> 01:56:16,592
Everybody comes here.
This is Hollywood, the land of dreams.

1570
01:56:16,634 --> 01:56:20,930
Some dreams come true, some don't.
But keep on dreamin'.

1571
01:56:20,972 --> 01:56:26,436
This is Hollywood. Always time
to dream, so keep on dreamin'.

1572
01:56:26,602 --> 01:56:27,812
# Pretty woman #

1573
01:56:27,895 --> 01:56:29,897
# Walkin' down the street #

1574
01:56:29,981 --> 01:56:33,693
# Pretty woman
The kind I like to meet #

1575
01:56:33,776 --> 01:56:36,404
# Pretty woman #

1576
01:56:36,487 --> 01:56:40,199
# I don't believe you
You're not the truth #

1577
01:56:40,283 --> 01:56:44,912
# No one could look
as good as you #

1578
01:56:46,622 --> 01:56:48,541
# Mercy #

1579
01:56:51,544 --> 01:56:55,423
# Pretty woman
won't you pardon me #

1580
01:56:55,465 --> 01:56:59,218
# Pretty woman
I couldn't help but see #

1581
01:56:59,302 --> 01:57:01,929
# Pretty woman #

1582
01:57:02,013 --> 01:57:05,808
# That you look lovely
as can be #

1583
01:57:05,892 --> 01:57:09,729
# Are you lonely
just like me #

1584
01:57:11,773 --> 01:57:16,819
# Oh, pretty woman ##

1585
01:57:32,376 --> 01:57:36,798
# You really took me
by surprise #

1586
01:57:39,384 --> 01:57:44,597
# You're someone
I've needed for a lifetime #

1587
01:57:46,474 --> 01:57:50,103
# Your heart
was cleverly disguised #

1588
01:57:53,398 --> 01:57:58,152
# And it didn't look that way
in my mind #

1589
01:57:58,194 --> 01:58:01,239
# Tell me
how could it be #

1590
01:58:01,322 --> 01:58:05,576
# I was the last to know #

1591
01:58:05,660 --> 01:58:09,997
# Darlin', I couldn't read
what was in your mind #

1592
01:58:10,081 --> 01:58:13,626
# To turn around and love me #

1593
01:58:13,709 --> 01:58:16,671
# With no #

1594
01:58:16,754 --> 01:58:19,674
# Explanation #

1595
01:58:19,716 --> 01:58:23,469
# I gave you everything I have #

1596
01:58:23,553 --> 01:58:27,473
# I didn't know
that you would take it #

1597
01:58:27,557 --> 01:58:32,603
# With sweet consideration #

1598
01:58:33,938 --> 01:58:38,025
# And after all
that we've been through #

1599
01:58:38,109 --> 01:58:41,279
# I can't believe it's true #

1600
01:58:41,362 --> 01:58:45,825
# Until I hear you say #

1601
01:58:52,123 --> 01:58:54,917
# Ooh #

1602
01:58:58,504 --> 01:59:02,091
# I know now, now, now #

1603
01:59:06,262 --> 01:59:09,557
# Ah #

1604
01:59:13,644 --> 01:59:19,233
# No explanation #

1605
01:59:19,275 --> 01:59:22,904
# I gave you everything I have #

1606
01:59:22,987 --> 01:59:27,492
# I didn't know
that you would take it ##
