1
00:02:42,074 --> 00:02:45,066
That's a big fella! Whoa!

2
00:03:12,204 --> 00:03:14,502
- Looks great.
- Thank you.

3
00:03:14,573 --> 00:03:16,700
Happy vacation, honey.

4
00:03:17,909 --> 00:03:20,173
Manchurian tung oil!
Where did you get this?

5
00:03:20,245 --> 00:03:22,543
Helen got it for me in Oslo.

6
00:03:22,614 --> 00:03:27,415
There's enough here
to do the whole table and the bureau.

7
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,754
I wonder what this could be.

8
00:03:30,822 --> 00:03:33,222
Oh, honey, you got it.
Thank you.

9
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:35,521
Enough to do
the entire guest room.

10
00:03:35,594 --> 00:03:37,994
I'm so glad we're spending
our vacation at home.

11
00:03:38,063 --> 00:03:40,725
- I'm gonna get started now.
- Where are you going?

12
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:48,030
- I'll get it.
- Be my guest.

13
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:54,074
- Maybe you should get it.
- I'll go.

14
00:04:00,452 --> 00:04:02,283
Oh, no!

15
00:04:07,626 --> 00:04:09,059
Jane.

16
00:04:10,829 --> 00:04:13,059
It's your turn, honey.

17
00:04:25,577 --> 00:04:27,738
- Good luck, honey.
- Thanks.

18
00:04:29,948 --> 00:04:33,008
Hi, Barbara. I'm glad I caught you.
Heard you were on vacation.

19
00:04:33,084 --> 00:04:34,608
That's right.
Complete vacation.

20
00:04:34,686 --> 00:04:38,486
Today I'm $260,000!

21
00:04:38,557 --> 00:04:41,549
- It's 6:45 in the morning.
- This offer is real.

22
00:04:41,626 --> 00:04:45,062
From a man in New York City
who only saw a photograph.

23
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:47,860
Jane, don't send people photos
of our house.

24
00:04:47,933 --> 00:04:52,233
He wants to bring the wife and family
here for some peace and quiet.

25
00:04:52,304 --> 00:04:54,101
That's what
we're looking for.

26
00:04:54,172 --> 00:04:58,768
This house is too big for you.
It ought to be for a couple with kids.

27
00:05:00,378 --> 00:05:04,075
I didn't mean anything.
But this house is too big.

28
00:05:04,149 --> 00:05:08,643
- I'll see you in a few weeks. Okay?
- Think about it.

29
00:05:20,732 --> 00:05:24,065
I was telling Barbara about this offer
on the house and--

30
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:34,444
Come with me to the store.

31
00:05:34,512 --> 00:05:38,175
- What for?
- I need a new brush for the tung oil.

32
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:42,448
- And I want to get a part for the model.
- Just run in, okay?

33
00:06:00,672 --> 00:06:04,073
Two weeks at home.
The perfect vacation.

34
00:06:04,142 --> 00:06:08,135
Jane says we should sell the house
to someone with a family.

35
00:06:08,213 --> 00:06:11,376
I don't think it's any
of Jane's business.

36
00:06:11,449 --> 00:06:14,885
Besides, we could try again
on this vacation.

37
00:06:14,953 --> 00:06:17,012
Really?
What are you saying?

38
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:36,935
- How are you doing, Ernie?
- Hi, how are ya?

39
00:06:45,917 --> 00:06:47,350
Morning, Adam.

40
00:06:47,419 --> 00:06:50,047
- Need a haircut before your vacation?
- No, thanks, Bill.

41
00:06:50,121 --> 00:06:51,782
- How's the model coming?
- Great.

42
00:06:51,856 --> 00:06:57,385
You know, Bozman built that foundation
in 1835. His grandson came--

43
00:07:06,438 --> 00:07:09,874
He's got hair down
to his goddamn shoulders.

44
00:07:09,941 --> 00:07:13,104
He says to me,
"Just trim it a little."

45
00:07:13,178 --> 00:07:16,944
- I took scissors to him so fast--
- See you later.

46
00:07:30,862 --> 00:07:34,958
- This will be great.
- Wouldn't you rather go to Jamaica?

47
00:07:35,033 --> 00:07:37,558
- No way. There's no place like home.
- Look out for that--

48
00:08:23,348 --> 00:08:25,782
Perfect start to our vacation.

49
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:28,614
You'll feel better when you're dry.

50
00:08:30,422 --> 00:08:34,153
That fire wasn't burning
when we left.

51
00:08:34,225 --> 00:08:37,922
- How's your arm?
- I don't know. It feels frozen.

52
00:08:54,946 --> 00:08:57,744
I'll make some coffee
and you get wood for the fire.

53
00:08:57,816 --> 00:09:00,614
Maybe we should take things
extra slow.

54
00:09:00,685 --> 00:09:04,052
Do you remember how
we got back up here?

55
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:09,349
I'm going back to the bridge
and retrace our steps.

56
00:09:23,608 --> 00:09:25,405
- You saved my--
- Two hours!

57
00:09:25,477 --> 00:09:28,878
- You won't believe-- What?
- That's how long you were gone.

58
00:09:30,148 --> 00:09:32,946
- What is going on?
- I have to show you something.

59
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:36,146
Look.

60
00:09:43,661 --> 00:09:45,595
There's that.

61
00:09:45,663 --> 00:09:48,257
And there's that.

62
00:09:54,939 --> 00:09:59,103
- "Handbook for the Recently Diseased."
- Deceased.

63
00:10:00,845 --> 00:10:02,335
Deceased.

64
00:10:02,413 --> 00:10:06,144
I don't know where it came from.
Look at the publisher.

65
00:10:10,054 --> 00:10:13,421
"Handbook for
the Recently Deceased Press."

66
00:10:13,491 --> 00:10:17,723
You know what? I don't think
we survived the crash.

67
00:10:21,366 --> 00:10:22,799
I hate this.

68
00:10:22,867 --> 00:10:25,893
Can you give me the basics?

69
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:28,996
This book isn't arranged that way.
What do you want to know?

70
00:10:29,073 --> 00:10:32,509
Why did you disappear
when you stepped off the porch?

71
00:10:32,577 --> 00:10:35,137
Are we halfway to heaven
or to hell?

72
00:10:35,213 --> 00:10:37,204
How long will this last?

73
00:10:37,282 --> 00:10:39,580
I don't see anything
about heaven or hell.

74
00:10:39,651 --> 00:10:42,620
The book reads like stereo instructions.
Listen.

75
00:10:42,687 --> 00:10:44,678
"Geographical and Temporal Perimeters.

76
00:10:44,756 --> 00:10:48,385
"Functional perimeters vary from
manifestation to manifestation."

77
00:10:49,961 --> 00:10:52,156
This is going to take some time.

78
00:11:15,486 --> 00:11:18,580
Damn sandworms.
Thirteen percent, huh?

79
00:11:18,656 --> 00:11:22,148
I better find a job.
Let's see. Business section.

80
00:11:28,066 --> 00:11:30,762
What do we got here?
The Maitlands.

81
00:11:32,704 --> 00:11:36,606
Cute couple.
Look nice and stupid, too.

82
00:11:42,814 --> 00:11:45,647
I wish I had a better view
of the cemetery from here.

83
00:11:45,717 --> 00:11:48,709
I can't tell which is
the best placement for us.

84
00:11:53,925 --> 00:11:55,756
Cabin fever?

85
00:11:55,827 --> 00:11:57,795
I can't clean properly.

86
00:11:57,862 --> 00:12:00,660
The vacuum's in the garage
and we can't leave the house.

87
00:12:00,732 --> 00:12:05,396
Where are the other dead people?
Why is it just you and me?

88
00:12:07,238 --> 00:12:09,729
Maybe this is heaven.

89
00:12:09,807 --> 00:12:11,900
In heaven there wouldn't be dust
on everything.

90
00:12:21,219 --> 00:12:22,481
It's Jane.

91
00:12:26,324 --> 00:12:28,087
- What's she doing here?
- I don't know.

92
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:31,185
Jane, up here. Jane!

93
00:12:36,401 --> 00:12:39,529
She can't see you, right?

94
00:12:41,105 --> 00:12:44,438
In the book, rule number 2:
The living usually won't see the dead.

95
00:12:46,711 --> 00:12:49,475
- Won't or can't?
- It just says "won't."

96
00:12:49,547 --> 00:12:53,483
God, this book is so stupid!
I can't understand anything in it.

97
00:12:54,786 --> 00:12:56,947
Barb, honey...

98
00:12:57,021 --> 00:12:58,818
we're dead.

99
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:02,257
I don't think we have much
to worry about anymore.

100
00:13:34,992 --> 00:13:39,622
This is great!
Just what the doctor ordered.

101
00:13:44,202 --> 00:13:46,102
Sorry, ma'am.

102
00:13:47,805 --> 00:13:51,297
Delia Deetz, welcome home.

103
00:13:51,376 --> 00:13:53,105
Charles!

104
00:13:53,177 --> 00:13:58,240
It's okay, there's no damage. See?
Good, sturdy country craftsmanship.

105
00:13:58,316 --> 00:14:02,412
Look at that kitchen. You'll finally
be able to cook a decent meal.

106
00:14:05,289 --> 00:14:07,621
Come have a look.

107
00:14:16,067 --> 00:14:20,163
A little gasoline. Blowtorch.
No problem.

108
00:14:20,238 --> 00:14:22,798
Excuse me.
Here we go.

109
00:14:33,518 --> 00:14:35,850
We'll have to rip out the plumbing.

110
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,185
Other than that, it's perfect.
Just perfect.

111
00:14:40,191 --> 00:14:43,422
- What do you think, honey?
- Delia hates it.

112
00:14:46,397 --> 00:14:48,024
I could live here.

113
00:14:48,099 --> 00:14:50,192
Careful! That's my sculpture.

114
00:14:50,268 --> 00:14:53,294
I don't mean "my" as in "I bought it."
I mean I made it.

115
00:14:55,506 --> 00:14:57,531
Put it on the table.

116
00:15:05,716 --> 00:15:09,652
Ten minutes.
I'm already perfectly at ease.

117
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,153
It's perfect.

118
00:15:11,222 --> 00:15:13,213
Help!

119
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:15,156
It's Otho.

120
00:15:15,226 --> 00:15:18,491
Otho, why don't you
come in the front door?

121
00:15:18,563 --> 00:15:19,996
It's bad luck.

122
00:15:20,064 --> 00:15:23,261
You left the city for me.
I am so happy.

123
00:15:23,334 --> 00:15:25,495
Of course you are.

124
00:15:27,772 --> 00:15:29,933
Let's get one thing straight.

125
00:15:30,007 --> 00:15:34,000
We're here to enjoy the country setting,
not to trash the place!

126
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:36,706
Charles, you're lucky
the yuppies are buying condos...

127
00:15:36,781 --> 00:15:41,115
so you can afford what I'm going
to have to do to this place.

128
00:15:41,185 --> 00:15:45,622
I'm here to relax and clip coupons,
and, damn it, I mean to do it.

129
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:48,318
Then go do it quietly, dear,
and let Otho and me think.

130
00:15:48,392 --> 00:15:50,553
Is the rest of the house
as bad as this?

131
00:15:50,628 --> 00:15:55,190
Is this a punishment?
What are we going to do?

132
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,825
We're not completely helpless.

133
00:15:58,903 --> 00:16:02,771
I've been reading that book and there's
a word for people in our situation.

134
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,104
Ghosts!

135
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:08,710
Let's get this show on the road.

136
00:16:11,983 --> 00:16:14,349
We're dealing with
negative entertainment potential.

137
00:16:14,418 --> 00:16:17,285
There's absolutely
no organic flow through.

138
00:16:17,355 --> 00:16:20,290
I noticed that, too.
It's like a giant ant farm.

139
00:16:23,394 --> 00:16:26,727
- What?
- I thought I saw something.

140
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,809
You read my mind.

141
00:16:39,877 --> 00:16:42,812
- I did?
- Few clients are able to read my mind.

142
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,781
They're not open
to the experience.

143
00:16:53,591 --> 00:16:55,491
My God!

144
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:59,963
We just have to pray the other closets
are bigger than this one.

145
00:17:00,031 --> 00:17:02,090
Look!

146
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:04,794
Ozzie and Harriet.

147
00:17:06,504 --> 00:17:08,301
- What happened to these people?
- They died.

148
00:17:08,372 --> 00:17:10,738
Look, an indoor outhouse.

149
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:19,309
- Viridian.
- Viridian. Why do I know that name?

150
00:17:19,383 --> 00:17:21,476
Blue-green!

151
00:17:21,552 --> 00:17:23,850
Hydrated chromic oxide.

152
00:17:23,921 --> 00:17:27,413
Remember, I'm schooled in chemistry.
I was a hair analyst.

153
00:17:27,491 --> 00:17:30,255
- What?
- Briefly.

154
00:17:35,066 --> 00:17:38,001
Deliver me from L.L. Bean.

155
00:17:39,604 --> 00:17:41,572
I know what you two are up to.

156
00:17:41,639 --> 00:17:44,733
- You're not going to get away with it.
- This is not working out.

157
00:17:44,809 --> 00:17:48,643
I will not stop living art
just because you need to relax.

158
00:17:49,914 --> 00:17:52,348
I will live with you
in this hellhole.

159
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:57,649
But I must express myself. If I can't
gut this house and make it my own...

160
00:17:57,722 --> 00:18:01,385
I will go insane
and I will take you with me!

161
00:18:03,027 --> 00:18:06,656
Yeah. Well, maybe the house
could use a little remodeling.

162
00:18:06,731 --> 00:18:10,690
But why don't you just leave
this room alone, okay?

163
00:18:18,309 --> 00:18:19,742
I'll get her.

164
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:21,437
So?

165
00:18:21,512 --> 00:18:26,211
Cover the wallpaper, knock down a few
walls and this place might be livable.

166
00:18:26,283 --> 00:18:29,081
- What's on the third floor?
- Attic space.

167
00:18:29,153 --> 00:18:31,553
I forgot to lock
the attic door.

168
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:41,355
- Did you feel something?
- When?

169
00:18:50,574 --> 00:18:53,634
- You don't have a key?
- Maybe Charles does.

170
00:18:53,711 --> 00:18:58,011
I have a feeling there's something
very interesting behind this door.

171
00:18:58,082 --> 00:19:01,950
Yeah, ghosts of the people who died
in this house, and they want us out!

172
00:19:02,019 --> 00:19:04,214
Let's do them a favor.

173
00:19:20,838 --> 00:19:23,238
My God, that was close!

174
00:19:24,709 --> 00:19:27,143
I cannot watch this.

175
00:19:27,211 --> 00:19:30,237
What's the good of being a ghost
if you can't frighten people away?

176
00:19:30,314 --> 00:19:32,942
- Honey?
- No, I'm not putting up with this!

177
00:19:43,027 --> 00:19:45,154
- You don't know what's out there.
- I don't care.

178
00:19:54,939 --> 00:19:57,840
- Barbara!
- Adam!

179
00:19:59,376 --> 00:20:02,868
Adam, help.
I'm getting all yellow!

180
00:20:42,887 --> 00:20:45,856
We're trapped in this house
with those people.

181
00:20:50,895 --> 00:20:53,887
I can't believe we're eating Cantonese.
Is there no Szechuan up here?

182
00:20:54,832 --> 00:20:58,461
I plan to have a stroke
from the MSG in this food.

183
00:20:58,536 --> 00:21:03,769
This is our first meal in this house,
so let's try to make it a pleasant one.

184
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:06,869
Don't bait your mother.

185
00:21:06,944 --> 00:21:09,879
When we get settled, we'll build you
a darkroom in the basement.

186
00:21:10,948 --> 00:21:13,917
My whole life is a darkroom.

187
00:21:13,984 --> 00:21:17,545
One big dark room.

188
00:21:17,621 --> 00:21:22,456
You were miserable in New York City,
and you'll be miserable in the sticks.

189
00:21:22,526 --> 00:21:24,426
At least someone's life
hasn't been upheaved.

190
00:21:24,495 --> 00:21:29,091
I'm happy here. Those people in New York
don't know what they're missing.

191
00:21:33,537 --> 00:21:36,301
We could become the summer art center
of New York.

192
00:21:36,373 --> 00:21:39,240
I could start sculpting again.
I'm only truly happy when I'm sculpting.

193
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:43,474
That's a very good idea.
That'll be very time-consuming.

194
00:21:43,547 --> 00:21:45,879
First the house.
Otho and I have great plans.

195
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:47,975
We should keep it
the way it is.

196
00:21:48,052 --> 00:21:50,043
Good idea.

197
00:21:54,592 --> 00:21:57,993
The furniture truck is coming. We
must decide what goes and what stays.

198
00:21:58,062 --> 00:22:00,553
Everything goes,
along with what's in the attic.

199
00:22:18,682 --> 00:22:20,172
Careful.

200
00:22:20,251 --> 00:22:23,982
Tell me what you do and I'll tell you
why my husband will fire you.

201
00:22:25,389 --> 00:22:28,449
- Isn't there an index?
- No, nothing.

202
00:22:30,227 --> 00:22:31,956
What's this?

203
00:22:37,768 --> 00:22:40,566
Do you know where that's going?
Did anyone tell you where--

204
00:22:40,638 --> 00:22:43,539
Why are there only three sculptures?
There were four sculptures.

205
00:22:43,607 --> 00:22:45,768
Where's the fourth sculpture?

206
00:22:45,843 --> 00:22:47,936
What are you doing?

207
00:22:53,017 --> 00:22:56,384
"Betelgeuse, the bio-exorcist.
Troubled by the living?

208
00:22:56,453 --> 00:22:58,978
"Is death a problem and not the solution?
Unhappy with eternity?

209
00:22:59,056 --> 00:23:02,514
"Having difficulty adjusting?
Call Betelgeuse."

210
00:23:05,596 --> 00:23:07,826
There's no number or instructions?

211
00:23:07,898 --> 00:23:11,197
Nothing. The bio-exorcist.
I don't get it.

212
00:23:15,439 --> 00:23:17,031
Straight back.

213
00:23:19,209 --> 00:23:23,043
Why don't you take a break
for half an hour?

214
00:23:43,067 --> 00:23:46,525
- Put that down!
- What the hell are you doing?

215
00:23:46,603 --> 00:23:49,094
- Listen to me!
- Jesus!

216
00:23:50,174 --> 00:23:53,575
Why are you doing this to me?
This is my art and it is dangerous.

217
00:23:53,644 --> 00:23:55,703
You think I want to die
like this?

218
00:24:21,171 --> 00:24:23,662
That little girl saw us.

219
00:24:23,741 --> 00:24:26,539
- Nobody can see us.
- But she did.

220
00:24:28,712 --> 00:24:31,476
- What happened to the previous owners?
- They drowned.

221
00:24:31,548 --> 00:24:34,517
Yes, they were family.
I was devastated.

222
00:24:34,585 --> 00:24:36,985
- Here, take that.
- Is this the key to the attic?

223
00:24:37,054 --> 00:24:41,650
That skeleton key will open any door.
Give that to your father.

224
00:24:41,725 --> 00:24:45,354
You might mention I single-handedly
decorated that house.

225
00:24:45,429 --> 00:24:49,661
If he needs any advice in that arena
have him come see me.

226
00:25:09,787 --> 00:25:11,448
Don't worry.
I locked the door.

227
00:25:29,573 --> 00:25:33,873
Having trouble with the living?
Tired of having your home violated?

228
00:25:33,944 --> 00:25:35,878
Want to get rid of them
pesky living critters?

229
00:25:35,946 --> 00:25:39,939
Well, come on down and see me,
the afterlife's leading bio-exorcist.

230
00:25:40,017 --> 00:25:43,953
Yes, sirree! I want to tell you,
I'll do anything!

231
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:50,322
I'll scare 'em real bad.
I'll do anything to get your business.

232
00:25:50,394 --> 00:25:53,522
Hell! I'll possess myself
if I gotta!

233
00:25:53,597 --> 00:25:57,055
Yo! I got demons runnin'
all through me.

234
00:25:57,134 --> 00:25:59,125
Come on down and see it.

235
00:25:59,203 --> 00:26:02,400
If you act now, you get a free
demon possession with every exorcism.

236
00:26:02,473 --> 00:26:04,464
You can't beat that, can you?

237
00:26:04,541 --> 00:26:09,945
Bring the little partners. We've got
plenty of snakes for them to play with.

238
00:26:10,013 --> 00:26:14,074
Say it once, say it twice,
third time's the charm. And remember--

239
00:26:14,151 --> 00:26:17,587
I'll eat anything you want me to eat
Swallow anything you want me to swallow

240
00:26:17,654 --> 00:26:20,555
But come on down
I'll chew on a dog

241
00:26:48,819 --> 00:26:53,916
We need some help. I read something
in this book about emergencies.

242
00:26:53,991 --> 00:26:58,485
Here it is.
"In case of emergency, draw a door."

243
00:27:02,132 --> 00:27:05,465
Draw a door? I don't know why
we keep looking in that stupid book.

244
00:27:08,805 --> 00:27:11,501
Maybe we should try
that Beetle guy.

245
00:27:26,924 --> 00:27:29,984
You didn't actually think
that would work, did you?

246
00:27:32,663 --> 00:27:34,597
Knock 3 times.

247
00:28:36,727 --> 00:28:38,388
Birdies!

248
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:53,639
- Can't you see I'm relaxing?
- I want to tell you what I saw.

249
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:57,476
What is the point of my coming here
if you people won't let me relax?

250
00:28:57,547 --> 00:28:59,515
Pumpkin, sweetheart...

251
00:29:00,584 --> 00:29:02,552
go help your mother.

252
00:29:02,619 --> 00:29:05,349
Maybe you can relax in a haunted house,
but I can't.

253
00:29:11,061 --> 00:29:12,892
Hmm, nice building.

254
00:29:12,963 --> 00:29:16,524
Bad roof. Good parking.

255
00:29:46,897 --> 00:29:49,422
- Adam?
- This way, honey.

256
00:30:01,244 --> 00:30:03,269
You don't have an appointment.

257
00:30:03,347 --> 00:30:05,577
- We didn't know how to make one.
- Appointment for what?

258
00:30:05,649 --> 00:30:07,640
- What do you want?
- Help?

259
00:30:07,718 --> 00:30:11,711
Already? Just bit the big one
two months ago and you want help.

260
00:30:11,788 --> 00:30:14,052
What does that have
to do with anything?

261
00:30:14,124 --> 00:30:17,924
You'll use up all
your help vouchers. D-90s.

262
00:30:17,994 --> 00:30:21,486
You spend 125 years on earth
in that house...

263
00:30:21,565 --> 00:30:25,899
during which you get only 3 class-one
D-90 intercessions with Juno.

264
00:30:25,969 --> 00:30:28,904
You probably haven't read through
the manual completely yet.

265
00:30:28,972 --> 00:30:31,941
You'll have to wait if you don't have
an appointment.

266
00:30:32,008 --> 00:30:36,945
- An appointment with whom?
- For Juno, your caseworker.

267
00:30:39,683 --> 00:30:43,141
Number 54,000,601. Ferndock!

268
00:31:48,852 --> 00:31:51,548
- Want a cigarette?
- No, thank you.

269
00:31:52,656 --> 00:31:54,954
I'm trying to cut down myself.

270
00:32:12,142 --> 00:32:15,908
Adam, is this what happens
when you die?

271
00:32:15,979 --> 00:32:18,243
This is what happens
when you die.

272
00:32:18,315 --> 00:32:21,580
That is what happens when he dies.
And that is what happens when they die.

273
00:32:21,651 --> 00:32:24,677
It's all very personal.
I'll tell you something.

274
00:32:24,754 --> 00:32:28,918
If I knew then what I know now,
I wouldn't have had my little accident.

275
00:32:34,631 --> 00:32:36,565
Maitland. Party of two.

276
00:32:36,633 --> 00:32:39,193
Take the handbook
and go to the sixth door.

277
00:32:39,269 --> 00:32:42,363
Oh, we forgot our handbook.

278
00:32:45,809 --> 00:32:46,798
Come on.

279
00:32:52,616 --> 00:32:56,177
All new arrivals,
report to waiting room number eight.

280
00:32:58,688 --> 00:33:02,454
Flight 409 is arriving
at gate three.

281
00:33:02,526 --> 00:33:05,051
How do I look?
There are no mirrors on this side.

282
00:33:05,128 --> 00:33:07,426
- You look fine.
- Fine.

283
00:33:07,497 --> 00:33:10,091
Thanks. I've been feeling
a little flat.

284
00:33:33,523 --> 00:33:36,686
125 years. I can't believe this.

285
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,853
I can't believe
they didn't tell us.

286
00:33:41,898 --> 00:33:44,389
Oh, Adam, what is this?

287
00:33:48,238 --> 00:33:51,071
That's the Lost Souls' Room.

288
00:33:51,141 --> 00:33:53,939
A room for ghosts
that have been exorcised.

289
00:33:55,078 --> 00:33:56,636
Poor devils.

290
00:33:56,713 --> 00:33:59,978
That's death for the dead.

291
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:02,280
It's all in the handbook.

292
00:34:02,352 --> 00:34:03,944
Keep moving.

293
00:34:08,625 --> 00:34:10,286
Five.

294
00:34:11,361 --> 00:34:13,386
This is the sixth door.

295
00:34:20,236 --> 00:34:23,831
Boy, this place
just gets weirder and weirder.

296
00:34:34,484 --> 00:34:36,782
We're home!

297
00:34:36,853 --> 00:34:40,414
Look at this place!
Everything's different.

298
00:34:41,825 --> 00:34:44,487
All our furniture's gone.

299
00:34:44,561 --> 00:34:47,189
How long do you suppose
we were waiting there?

300
00:34:47,263 --> 00:34:48,855
Three months.

301
00:34:49,933 --> 00:34:52,959
I'd almost given up on you.
I was about to leave.

302
00:34:53,036 --> 00:34:55,561
I do have other clients.

303
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:58,199
- Are you Juno, our caseworker?
- Yes.

304
00:34:58,274 --> 00:35:01,573
I evaluate individual cases
and determine...

305
00:35:01,645 --> 00:35:04,876
if help is needed, deserved
and available.

306
00:35:04,948 --> 00:35:06,779
Are you available?

307
00:35:08,251 --> 00:35:11,448
- What's wrong?
- We're very unhappy.

308
00:35:11,521 --> 00:35:13,955
What did you expect?
You're dead!

309
00:35:14,024 --> 00:35:18,290
We want to get rid of the people here.
We worked hard on this house.

310
00:35:18,361 --> 00:35:21,353
We probably wouldn't mind sharing
the house with people who were--

311
00:35:21,431 --> 00:35:23,899
- More like you used to be.
- Yes.

312
00:35:23,967 --> 00:35:25,594
But these people!

313
00:35:27,671 --> 00:35:30,697
Things seem quiet here.

314
00:35:30,774 --> 00:35:34,266
You should thank God
you didn't die in Italy.

315
00:35:34,344 --> 00:35:35,834
The Deetzes!

316
00:35:35,912 --> 00:35:39,939
- Have you been studying the manual?
- We tried.

317
00:35:40,016 --> 00:35:43,918
The intermediate interface chapter
on haunting says it all.

318
00:35:43,987 --> 00:35:48,048
Get them out yourselves!
It's your house.

319
00:35:48,124 --> 00:35:50,888
Haunted houses
aren't easy to come by.

320
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,394
- We don't quite get it.
- I heard.

321
00:35:53,463 --> 00:35:55,397
Tore your faces off.

322
00:35:55,465 --> 00:35:59,595
It's useless to pull off your heads
in front of people who can't see you.

323
00:35:59,669 --> 00:36:02,137
- We should start simply?
- Start simply.

324
00:36:02,205 --> 00:36:05,106
Do what you know.
Use your talents. Practice.

325
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:10,710
You should have been studying
those lessons since day one.

326
00:36:12,816 --> 00:36:14,443
I've got to go.

327
00:36:14,517 --> 00:36:17,008
What about that guy in the flyer,
Betel--

328
00:36:18,321 --> 00:36:21,620
Don't even say his name.
You don't want his help.

329
00:36:21,691 --> 00:36:23,659
We might.

330
00:36:23,727 --> 00:36:27,527
No, you don't.
He does not work well with others.

331
00:36:28,598 --> 00:36:30,532
What do you mean?

332
00:36:34,471 --> 00:36:36,439
I didn't want to bring it up.

333
00:36:36,506 --> 00:36:41,603
But rather than have you make
another mistake, I'll tell you.

334
00:36:41,678 --> 00:36:43,873
He was my assistant.

335
00:36:43,947 --> 00:36:47,110
But he was a troublemaker.
He went out on his own...

336
00:36:47,183 --> 00:36:50,482
as a freelance bio-exorcist.

337
00:36:50,553 --> 00:36:54,512
Claimed he could get rid of the living.
Got into more trouble.

338
00:36:58,495 --> 00:37:03,023
I believe he's been sleazing
around your cemetery lately.

339
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:07,033
The only way
he can be brought back...

340
00:37:07,103 --> 00:37:10,163
is by calling his name
three times.

341
00:37:10,874 --> 00:37:13,308
But I strongly suggest...

342
00:37:13,376 --> 00:37:16,209
that you remove
the Deetzes yourselves.

343
00:37:16,279 --> 00:37:18,304
How do we contact you...

344
00:37:18,381 --> 00:37:20,474
if we need you again?

345
00:37:30,226 --> 00:37:33,559
Oh, Adam,
that guy's in our cemetery.

346
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:37,259
She's right. We just keep this simple.
We can do this.

347
00:38:01,324 --> 00:38:03,884
Hey, you, come here!

348
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,894
Hungry?

349
00:38:05,962 --> 00:38:08,123
Come on.
Hey, come here.

350
00:38:09,299 --> 00:38:12,291
I got something good for you.
Come on over.

351
00:38:12,368 --> 00:38:15,235
We'll have a little bite,
something to nosh.

352
00:38:16,673 --> 00:38:19,403
- Come here!
- Help me!

353
00:38:23,313 --> 00:38:27,613
Maxie, haven't I always made you money?
That's the only real question.

354
00:38:27,684 --> 00:38:32,553
Nobody made me money like you.
You were a demon until your nerves went.

355
00:38:32,622 --> 00:38:34,886
It's just that...

356
00:38:34,958 --> 00:38:38,325
Winter River, Connecticut, is,
if you'll forgive me, nowhere.

357
00:38:38,394 --> 00:38:41,557
Why would I want to invest that kind
of money in an old building?

358
00:38:41,631 --> 00:38:45,294
- It's way the hell up there!
- It's not a building. That's the beauty.

359
00:38:45,368 --> 00:38:49,361
The people don't know the value of their
property. I can buy the whole town.

360
00:38:49,439 --> 00:38:52,704
Then we own a whole town
full of nowhere.

361
00:38:52,775 --> 00:38:54,299
Come and see.

362
00:38:54,377 --> 00:38:56,743
And bring Sarah.

363
00:38:56,813 --> 00:39:00,476
All right, Charles.
It's just that I am kind of busy here.

364
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:03,178
Just a minute.

365
00:39:03,253 --> 00:39:06,518
Listen. Enough of this talk
about visiting, okay? I gotta go.

366
00:39:06,589 --> 00:39:09,217
You take it easy up there,
big fellow.

367
00:39:09,292 --> 00:39:12,090
- Good-bye.
- Max, wait, wait.

368
00:39:15,765 --> 00:39:17,232
Putz.

369
00:39:37,987 --> 00:39:42,287
Lydia, is Connecticut so boring?
I had Maxie Dean on the phone.

370
00:39:42,358 --> 00:39:45,885
Dad's found a way of making money
while I relax, so would you scram?

371
00:39:48,164 --> 00:39:52,191
Your mother will kill you when she sees
you cut holes in her $300 sheets.

372
00:39:55,104 --> 00:39:58,631
This is so corny. Is this what
we've been reduced to? Sheets?

373
00:39:58,708 --> 00:40:00,642
Think of them as death shrouds.

374
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:03,144
And the moaning is important.
Really moan!

375
00:40:21,597 --> 00:40:24,327
God, how can he stand that woman?

376
00:40:30,707 --> 00:40:34,768
Cut it out!
I'm a child, for God's sakes.

377
00:40:42,218 --> 00:40:46,120
- I feel so stupid.
- It's not stupid. We're ghosts!

378
00:40:46,189 --> 00:40:49,420
Do you want to spend the next 125 years
having breakfast with this woman?

379
00:40:49,492 --> 00:40:51,084
Moan louder.

380
00:40:59,335 --> 00:41:01,735
Oh, God!

381
00:41:08,678 --> 00:41:10,942
Sick. Sexual perversion.

382
00:41:11,014 --> 00:41:14,780
Do that weird sexual stuff
in your own bedroom.

383
00:41:20,423 --> 00:41:22,687
Ah, no feet.

384
00:41:34,137 --> 00:41:36,833
Are you the guys
hiding in the attic?

385
00:41:36,906 --> 00:41:39,875
We're ghosts!

386
00:41:39,942 --> 00:41:42,740
- What do you look like under there?
- Aren't you scared?

387
00:41:42,812 --> 00:41:46,111
I'm not scared of sheets.
Are you gross under there?

388
00:41:46,182 --> 00:41:48,810
Are you Night of the Living Dead
under there?

389
00:41:48,885 --> 00:41:51,251
Like all bloody veins and pus?

390
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:54,483
- Night of the what?
- Living Dead. It's a movie.

391
00:41:54,557 --> 00:41:57,685
If I had seen a ghost at your age,
I would have been scared out of my wits.

392
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:01,526
You're not gross.
Why are you wearing sheets?

393
00:42:01,597 --> 00:42:03,224
We're practicing.

394
00:42:03,299 --> 00:42:07,065
- You can see us without the sheets?
- Of course I can see you.

395
00:42:07,136 --> 00:42:09,366
How can you see us
and nobody else can?

396
00:42:10,907 --> 00:42:14,502
I read through that
Handbook for the Recently Deceased.

397
00:42:14,577 --> 00:42:19,981
It says, "Live people ignore
the strange and unusual."

398
00:42:20,049 --> 00:42:24,281
I myself am strange and unusual.

399
00:42:24,353 --> 00:42:26,218
You look normal.

400
00:42:27,457 --> 00:42:29,687
- You read our book?
- Yes.

401
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:32,819
- You could follow it?
- Yes. Why were you in Delia's bedroom?

402
00:42:32,895 --> 00:42:35,022
- Trying to scare your mother.
- Stepmother.

403
00:42:35,598 --> 00:42:39,398
You can't scare her.
She's sleeping with Prince Valium.

404
00:42:42,538 --> 00:42:43,971
You did this?

405
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:46,600
You carved these houses and things?

406
00:42:48,077 --> 00:42:50,841
And this used to be your house.

407
00:42:50,913 --> 00:42:53,108
Why do you want to scare everybody?

408
00:42:53,182 --> 00:42:56,117
We wanted to frighten you
so you would move out.

409
00:42:57,987 --> 00:43:00,046
You don't know the Deetzes.

410
00:43:00,123 --> 00:43:04,150
My father bought this place.
He never walks away from equity.

411
00:43:04,227 --> 00:43:08,129
- Why don't you leave?
- We haven't left since the funeral.

412
00:43:09,265 --> 00:43:11,028
Funeral!

413
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:13,728
God! You guys really are dead.

414
00:43:16,305 --> 00:43:18,330
This is amazing.

415
00:43:19,909 --> 00:43:21,433
- I better go.
- Wait.

416
00:43:21,511 --> 00:43:26,175
- Don't tell your parents we're here.
- Unless it will frighten them away.

417
00:43:26,249 --> 00:43:28,615
Tell them we are horrible...

418
00:43:28,684 --> 00:43:31,016
desperate ghoulish creatures
who will stop at nothing...

419
00:43:31,087 --> 00:43:33,385
to get our house back.

420
00:43:35,458 --> 00:43:39,690
What if this is a dream? Can you do
any tricks to prove I'm not dreaming?

421
00:43:44,333 --> 00:43:48,667
If you are real ghosts, you better get
another routine because those sheets...

422
00:43:48,738 --> 00:43:50,706
they don't work.

423
00:44:00,082 --> 00:44:01,379
Ghosts.

424
00:44:01,450 --> 00:44:03,975
You're telling me we have ghosts
in this house.

425
00:44:04,053 --> 00:44:06,613
Those pictures are of ghosts.

426
00:44:06,689 --> 00:44:08,486
Ghosts!

427
00:44:08,558 --> 00:44:12,324
Lydia, I am giving a dinner party
tonight for seven people.

428
00:44:12,395 --> 00:44:15,956
My agent, Bernard, is bringing a woman
who writes for Art in America.

429
00:44:16,032 --> 00:44:19,468
In fact, no one dining here
has not been in Vanity Fair except you.

430
00:44:20,436 --> 00:44:22,461
I told them you were too mean
to be afraid.

431
00:44:22,538 --> 00:44:24,597
Don't you dare speak to others
about me!

432
00:44:24,674 --> 00:44:28,735
Being embarrassed in front of the few
people who will set foot here scares me.

433
00:44:28,811 --> 00:44:31,211
So let's play family
just for tonight.

434
00:44:36,986 --> 00:44:39,181
Lydia's trying,
but they don't believe her.

435
00:44:39,255 --> 00:44:41,587
She's got photos.

436
00:44:41,657 --> 00:44:44,820
Adam, you have a photo of Bigfoot.

437
00:44:44,894 --> 00:44:48,057
My photo of Bigfoot
is a different story.

438
00:44:48,130 --> 00:44:52,658
We've got to get some help. We've got
to contact Betelmeyer or something.

439
00:45:06,415 --> 00:45:07,939
Look.

440
00:45:11,854 --> 00:45:14,015
It's him, Betelgeuse.

441
00:45:19,028 --> 00:45:21,053
Go ahead, Barbara, say it.

442
00:45:27,737 --> 00:45:29,329
What happened?

443
00:45:30,406 --> 00:45:32,670
I think we're in the model.

444
00:45:36,012 --> 00:45:37,946
Look at that.

445
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:02,637
Where is he?
What do we do?

446
00:46:06,842 --> 00:46:08,969
Looks like we dig.

447
00:46:39,141 --> 00:46:41,371
It's about time!

448
00:46:49,251 --> 00:46:52,880
- I say we open it.
- Maybe we should knock first.

449
00:47:10,439 --> 00:47:13,203
Adam. Babs.

450
00:47:19,915 --> 00:47:24,352
You can pick 'em! Is this
a solid relationship? Do I have a shot?

451
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:27,412
- Excuse me.
- Sure. Am I overstepping my bounds?

452
00:47:27,490 --> 00:47:32,154
It's beautiful! You picked me.
You didn't have to, but you picked me.

453
00:47:32,228 --> 00:47:35,163
It makes me want to kiss you guys!
Come on, give me one.

454
00:47:35,231 --> 00:47:37,222
I beg your pardon!

455
00:47:37,299 --> 00:47:39,233
Let's get down to business.

456
00:47:39,301 --> 00:47:42,065
I've got a card here somewhere.
Here. Who do I have to kill?

457
00:47:42,138 --> 00:47:45,369
- Hold that for me.
- Whoa!

458
00:47:45,441 --> 00:47:47,841
- There you go.
- You don't have to kill anybody!

459
00:47:47,910 --> 00:47:52,677
Possession! Learn to throw your voice.
Fool your friends. Fun at parties.

460
00:47:52,748 --> 00:47:56,149
No. We just want to get some people
out of our house.

461
00:47:56,218 --> 00:48:00,621
I understand. In order to do that,
I'll have to get to know you.

462
00:48:00,689 --> 00:48:03,351
We've got to get closer.
Move in with you for a while.

463
00:48:03,426 --> 00:48:06,623
Get to be real pals.
You know what I'm saying?

464
00:48:06,695 --> 00:48:08,629
Save that guy for later.

465
00:48:08,697 --> 00:48:11,029
My wife and I have some questions.

466
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:13,295
Sure, go ahead. Shoot.

467
00:48:13,369 --> 00:48:15,428
What are your qualifications?

468
00:48:15,504 --> 00:48:19,440
Well, I attended Juilliard. I'm
a graduate of Harvard Business School.

469
00:48:19,508 --> 00:48:23,069
I travel extensively.
I lived through the Black Plague.

470
00:48:23,145 --> 00:48:26,046
I've seen The Exorcist
about 167 times...

471
00:48:26,115 --> 00:48:29,846
and it keeps getting funnier
every time I see it!

472
00:48:29,919 --> 00:48:32,581
Not to mention the fact
that you're talking to a dead guy!

473
00:48:32,655 --> 00:48:35,818
Now what do you think?
You think I'm qualified?

474
00:48:36,892 --> 00:48:38,826
Can you be scary?

475
00:48:38,894 --> 00:48:43,058
Oh! I know what you're asking me.
Can I be scary?

476
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:46,668
What do you think of this?

477
00:48:46,735 --> 00:48:49,203
You like it?

478
00:48:49,271 --> 00:48:52,798
- Will you excuse us, please?
- Sure. Talk amongst yourselves.

479
00:48:52,875 --> 00:48:56,174
- Let's go.
- I know, but he can be useful later.

480
00:48:56,245 --> 00:49:00,204
- We can work something ourselves.
- Oh, yeah!

481
00:49:00,282 --> 00:49:02,079
- Excuse me!
- What?

482
00:49:02,151 --> 00:49:04,085
We are leaving now.

483
00:49:04,153 --> 00:49:06,246
Don't go yet.

484
00:49:06,322 --> 00:49:11,225
Come on, we're simpatico.
Look at us. We shop at the same store.

485
00:49:11,293 --> 00:49:13,227
Hey, hermano.

486
00:49:13,295 --> 00:49:15,320
Yeah, there you go.

487
00:49:16,899 --> 00:49:19,231
We're like peas in a pod.

488
00:49:19,301 --> 00:49:23,567
You want someone out of the house.
I want to get someone out of your house.

489
00:49:23,639 --> 00:49:27,268
Look! You've been to Saturn.
I've been to Saturn!

490
00:49:27,343 --> 00:49:29,811
Whoa. Sandworms.

491
00:49:29,879 --> 00:49:33,110
You hate 'em, right?
I hate 'em myself.

492
00:49:33,182 --> 00:49:36,845
Kids, what do I have to do
to strike a deal with you two?

493
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:47,261
- Don't you hate it when that happens?
- Let's go, Barbara!

494
00:49:47,329 --> 00:49:50,730
Come up for a while.
We'll talk inside. Come on.

495
00:49:50,799 --> 00:49:53,063
- I'm not staying.
- The place is a mess.

496
00:49:53,135 --> 00:49:57,504
We have to get out of here.
Home! Home! Home!

497
00:49:58,541 --> 00:50:00,532
How did you do that?

498
00:50:00,609 --> 00:50:02,804
Hope you like Italian.

499
00:50:02,878 --> 00:50:05,711
Where'd you go?
Hey, where'd you go?

500
00:50:05,781 --> 00:50:08,272
Hey! You've got
to work with me here.

501
00:50:08,350 --> 00:50:10,910
I'm just trying to cut a deal.
What do you want me to do?

502
00:50:10,986 --> 00:50:12,749
Where are you?

503
00:50:12,821 --> 00:50:15,312
You bunch of losers!

504
00:50:15,391 --> 00:50:19,054
You're working with
a professional here!

505
00:50:22,531 --> 00:50:24,761
Nice fucking model!

506
00:50:24,833 --> 00:50:27,427
We can do this stuff on our own.

507
00:50:27,503 --> 00:50:30,734
Besides, I'm not exposing
that little girl to that pervert.

508
00:50:30,806 --> 00:50:33,798
We did call him,
and he seemed awfully pissed off.

509
00:50:33,876 --> 00:50:39,212
I don't care. I've changed my mind.
We can scare them off ourselves tonight.

510
00:50:39,281 --> 00:50:41,306
I have an idea.

511
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:50,358
What you did with the place
is wonderful.

512
00:50:50,426 --> 00:50:52,451
Not me. Them.

513
00:50:53,529 --> 00:50:55,554
So?

514
00:50:59,602 --> 00:51:01,627
Do you like them?

515
00:51:01,704 --> 00:51:05,936
I hope it wasn't yet another
of your dreary suicide attempts.

516
00:51:06,008 --> 00:51:08,806
You know what they say about people
who commit suicide.

517
00:51:08,877 --> 00:51:11,846
In the afterlife,
they become civil servants.

518
00:51:14,149 --> 00:51:17,118
Otho, I didn't realize
you were into the supernatural.

519
00:51:17,186 --> 00:51:19,313
Of course! You remember.

520
00:51:19,388 --> 00:51:22,084
After my stint
with the Living Theater...

521
00:51:22,157 --> 00:51:25,718
I was one of New York's
leading paranormal researchers...

522
00:51:25,794 --> 00:51:27,762
until the bottom dropped out
in '72.

523
00:51:27,830 --> 00:51:30,628
Paranormal? Is that what
they're calling your kind these days?

524
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:36,328
Don't mind her. She's still upset that
somebody dropped a house on her sister.

525
00:51:39,541 --> 00:51:42,237
Well, this looks really good.

526
00:51:43,512 --> 00:51:46,310
I saw some ghosts.

527
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:55,115
- It's a private joke Lydia and I share.
- It's not a joke.

528
00:51:55,190 --> 00:51:59,524
Yes, it is. Just today she tried
to convince me this house is haunted.

529
00:52:01,497 --> 00:52:04,330
Kids! You know, I love them!

530
00:52:05,668 --> 00:52:09,365
- Ghosts?
- In designer sheets, no less.

531
00:52:09,438 --> 00:52:12,839
I'd like to propose a toast
to our intrepid friends...

532
00:52:12,908 --> 00:52:16,002
who braved the expressway
and two dozen tollbooths to be with us.

533
00:52:16,078 --> 00:52:18,103
May your buildings go condo.

534
00:52:19,782 --> 00:52:22,683
Lydia, favor us
about your ghosts.

535
00:52:22,751 --> 00:52:25,276
No! I am sick of that subject.

536
00:52:25,354 --> 00:52:27,618
Delia, lighten up.

537
00:52:27,690 --> 00:52:30,215
I would rather talk about--

538
00:52:45,274 --> 00:52:46,798
That's cute, Delia.

539
00:52:59,088 --> 00:53:02,148
Otho, are you doing this?

540
00:54:28,877 --> 00:54:30,811
We did it!

541
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:33,677
Let's watch them scatter.

542
00:54:33,749 --> 00:54:37,412
Any minute now they'll come
running out that door screaming.

543
00:54:40,656 --> 00:54:42,146
Any minute now.

544
00:54:49,364 --> 00:54:51,332
It's me, Lydia.

545
00:54:54,336 --> 00:54:56,270
They want you
to come downstairs.

546
00:54:56,338 --> 00:55:00,274
Delia says you can wear
any sheets you want.

547
00:55:00,342 --> 00:55:04,369
It was like being
in an amusement park. Bam!

548
00:55:04,446 --> 00:55:08,382
- I didn't know I could do the calypso.
- Who has more fun than us?

549
00:55:08,450 --> 00:55:11,419
We're dealing with Tracy and Hepburn.

550
00:55:11,486 --> 00:55:15,252
A very sophisticated pair.
They even appear in sheets.

551
00:55:16,525 --> 00:55:19,722
Charles, why didn't you tell us
about this before?

552
00:55:21,263 --> 00:55:25,962
We're not sure we want our secret out.
Everyone will want them for parties.

553
00:55:26,034 --> 00:55:27,797
People will pay big money for this.

554
00:55:27,870 --> 00:55:31,897
The Enquirer's offering $50,000
for proof of life after death.

555
00:55:33,709 --> 00:55:36,735
This is it, Charles.
You can get Maxie Dean up here now.

556
00:55:36,812 --> 00:55:40,748
- You think so?
- Sarah loves the supernatural.

557
00:55:40,816 --> 00:55:43,011
She'll have him sprint up here
in his helicopter...

558
00:55:43,085 --> 00:55:45,747
if you can produce ghosts for her.

559
00:55:49,258 --> 00:55:52,250
I should remind you
that I'm Delia's agent.

560
00:55:52,327 --> 00:55:54,659
I have lost money on her work
for years.

561
00:55:54,730 --> 00:55:57,324
If anything happened here,
I shall handle it.

562
00:55:57,399 --> 00:55:59,731
But not until
I've seen real proof.

563
00:55:59,801 --> 00:56:03,999
- What about this table?
- What do you call what just happened?

564
00:56:04,072 --> 00:56:05,835
What money?
Don't you believe in my work?

565
00:56:06,441 --> 00:56:08,068
Here's Lydia.

566
00:56:09,611 --> 00:56:12,603
- Well?
- They don't want to come down.

567
00:56:20,055 --> 00:56:21,488
Why not?

568
00:56:23,091 --> 00:56:27,221
I think they were trying to scare you
away, and you didn't get scared.

569
00:56:27,296 --> 00:56:31,528
They're dead.
It's a little late to be neurotic.

570
00:56:34,569 --> 00:56:36,002
All right.

571
00:56:41,677 --> 00:56:45,943
This was not a hallucination.
This was real.

572
00:56:46,014 --> 00:56:51,384
We all experienced a superpowerful
paranormal experience and it was real.

573
00:56:51,453 --> 00:56:55,719
Delia, you are a flake.
You have always been a flake.

574
00:56:55,791 --> 00:57:00,956
If you insist on frightening people,
do it with your sculpture.

575
00:57:01,029 --> 00:57:02,724
Drive carefully!

576
00:57:02,798 --> 00:57:04,732
- I'm dead.
- Where do they hide?

577
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:07,928
- The attic.
- The attic's locked.

578
00:57:08,003 --> 00:57:10,597
They're ghosts.
They can do what they want.

579
00:57:10,672 --> 00:57:13,835
They do whatever they want.
Take us up there right now.

580
00:57:20,282 --> 00:57:23,615
Fabulous! Otho Fenlock's
"Locked Door Ghosts!"

581
00:57:23,685 --> 00:57:25,277
Probably committed suicide there.

582
00:57:25,354 --> 00:57:27,618
- I'm enchanted.
- In there?

583
00:57:27,689 --> 00:57:30,624
- They must live like animals.
- It's locked. How did they get in?

584
00:57:30,692 --> 00:57:33,786
Open this door, dead people,
or we'll bust it down...

585
00:57:33,862 --> 00:57:36,387
and drag you out by the ropes
you hanged yourself with!

586
00:57:36,465 --> 00:57:38,899
- They didn't commit suicide.
- It doesn't matter.

587
00:57:38,967 --> 00:57:42,596
I can teach you something here.
Take the upper hand in all situations...

588
00:57:42,671 --> 00:57:45,572
or people, dead or alive,
will walk all over you.

589
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:47,471
Open up!

590
00:57:59,287 --> 00:58:00,948
Where are they?

591
00:58:01,023 --> 00:58:03,617
These ghosts are nice people.

592
00:58:03,692 --> 00:58:06,388
I think we scared them away,
so let's leave them alone, all right?

593
00:58:07,429 --> 00:58:10,694
It's the whole damn town.

594
00:58:10,766 --> 00:58:14,133
I have never been so embarrassed.

595
00:58:14,202 --> 00:58:16,136
Have they gone for good?

596
00:58:22,411 --> 00:58:24,072
Dad, don't.

597
00:58:24,146 --> 00:58:26,410
Mom, let's just go.

598
00:58:38,693 --> 00:58:41,184
No ghosts here.

599
00:58:43,065 --> 00:58:45,898
Come on! If they are in here,
I don't want to scare them away.

600
00:58:48,537 --> 00:58:51,938
We're leaving now.
You can go about your business.

601
00:58:53,942 --> 00:58:56,775
- What are we doing?
- Quick, quick, quick.

602
00:59:04,019 --> 00:59:07,147
Oh, boy! You guys are really spooksters,
aren't you?

603
00:59:08,156 --> 00:59:11,785
Now, let's turn on the juice
and see what shakes loose.

604
00:59:14,429 --> 00:59:18,229
Otho, get Maxie on the phone.
We've really got something here.

605
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:22,361
We can turn this place into the world's
leading supernatural research center.

606
00:59:22,437 --> 00:59:25,565
Amusement park. I'll do a presentation,
Lydia will bring the ghosts.

607
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:28,632
I can't bring the ghosts.
They're not here.

608
00:59:28,710 --> 00:59:32,441
- Otho, can't you do something?
- If I'm properly motivated.

609
00:59:35,117 --> 00:59:37,881
What type of motivation
do you require?

610
00:59:37,953 --> 00:59:41,821
Why don't you leave them alone?
They didn't do anything to you.

611
01:00:29,271 --> 01:00:32,069
We've come for your daughter, Chuck.

612
01:00:32,908 --> 01:00:34,307
Stop! Stop!

613
01:00:46,121 --> 01:00:48,851
- Betelgeuse, Betelgeuse, Betelgeuse!
- Oh, no!

614
01:00:50,892 --> 01:00:53,190
Why are you doing this?

615
01:00:54,563 --> 01:00:57,396
Leave me alone, all of you!

616
01:01:00,302 --> 01:01:00,335
Great choice! We spend the next century
hanging out a window or doing tricks.

617
01:01:00,335 --> 01:01:05,773
Great choice! We spend the next century
hanging out a window or doing tricks.

618
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:08,536
Maybe they'll leave now.
That snake was a nasty customer.

619
01:01:08,610 --> 01:01:10,737
- He could've hurt somebody.
- But he didn't.

620
01:01:10,812 --> 01:01:13,280
We've got them where we want them.

621
01:01:17,352 --> 01:01:21,345
You losers! How dare you interrupt
a professional while he's working!

622
01:01:21,423 --> 01:01:24,153
I'm not fond of Charles,
but you could've killed him.

623
01:01:24,226 --> 01:01:27,423
I'm just doing my job!
I thought we had a deal.

624
01:01:27,495 --> 01:01:29,986
It's okay. You know why?

625
01:01:30,065 --> 01:01:34,559
I don't want to do business
with you deadbeats anyway, thank you.

626
01:01:34,636 --> 01:01:38,504
The only one I think I can deal with
is Edgar Allan Poe's daughter.

627
01:01:38,573 --> 01:01:40,939
- She understands me.
- Leave her alone!

628
01:01:53,388 --> 01:01:56,221
Go ahead, make my millennium.

629
01:02:03,265 --> 01:02:07,224
I'm feeling a little anxious,
if you know what I mean.

630
01:02:07,302 --> 01:02:09,770
It's been about 600 years.

631
01:02:09,838 --> 01:02:13,604
I wonder where an everyday Joe
like myself...

632
01:02:13,675 --> 01:02:15,768
can find a little action.

633
01:02:32,794 --> 01:02:34,887
Yeah. Here I come, baby.

634
01:02:39,234 --> 01:02:41,168
Hey, Adam, nice move!

635
01:02:42,671 --> 01:02:45,606
- Why did you build that?
- I didn't.

636
01:02:55,350 --> 01:02:57,682
Will you guys shut up
and leave me alone?

637
01:02:57,752 --> 01:03:00,084
I've got all this paperwork to do.

638
01:03:02,390 --> 01:03:04,449
You two, come in.
Sit down.

639
01:03:04,526 --> 01:03:06,960
Get in here, both of you!

640
01:03:10,231 --> 01:03:14,691
The whorehouse was my idea.
I want Betelgeuse out of the picture.

641
01:03:15,537 --> 01:03:18,131
You have really screwed up.

642
01:03:18,206 --> 01:03:21,198
I heard you allowed yourselves
to be photographed.

643
01:03:21,276 --> 01:03:24,040
You let Betelgeuse out
and didn't put him back.

644
01:03:24,112 --> 01:03:26,512
And you let Otho take the handbook!

645
01:03:26,581 --> 01:03:27,980
When?

646
01:03:29,050 --> 01:03:31,541
Never trust the living!

647
01:03:31,619 --> 01:03:34,315
We cannot have
a routine haunting like yours...

648
01:03:34,389 --> 01:03:38,723
provide proof that
there is existence beyond death.

649
01:03:38,793 --> 01:03:42,251
Coach, where's the men's room?

650
01:03:42,330 --> 01:03:44,958
I'm not your coach.
He survived.

651
01:03:45,033 --> 01:03:47,126
Let me get something straight.

652
01:03:47,202 --> 01:03:50,729
- What's our curfew?
- Get out of here!

653
01:03:50,805 --> 01:03:53,899
Go on, get downstairs!
Men's room!

654
01:03:53,975 --> 01:03:56,569
Are you kidding?
Can't you read signs?

655
01:03:56,644 --> 01:03:58,737
I'll be right back.

656
01:04:10,692 --> 01:04:13,126
Maybe this was a bad idea.

657
01:04:13,194 --> 01:04:15,219
I didn't say anything.

658
01:04:17,065 --> 01:04:20,034
Who are we kidding?
You've never had a bad idea.

659
01:04:20,101 --> 01:04:21,534
Yeah?

660
01:04:24,005 --> 01:04:28,101
This could all work out.
Home.

661
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:34,908
I'm not sure this is
the right environment for Lydia.

662
01:04:34,983 --> 01:04:37,543
- Snakes. Ghosts.
- Shrimp.

663
01:04:38,653 --> 01:04:40,587
You family types.

664
01:04:40,655 --> 01:04:44,455
You've got other things to worry about.
Maxie Dean is coming tonight.

665
01:04:44,526 --> 01:04:48,360
You have to sell these ghosts.
I can only do so much.

666
01:04:48,430 --> 01:04:51,695
What are you going to do?
Viciously rearrange their environment?

667
01:04:51,766 --> 01:04:55,930
I know as much about the supernatural
as I do about interior design.

668
01:05:03,845 --> 01:05:07,212
I am alone.

669
01:05:17,225 --> 01:05:19,318
I am...

670
01:05:19,394 --> 01:05:22,329
utterly alone.

671
01:05:23,865 --> 01:05:28,268
By the time you read this...

672
01:05:29,471 --> 01:05:32,497
I will be gone...

673
01:05:34,242 --> 01:05:37,006
having jumped--

674
01:05:38,279 --> 01:05:42,807
Having plummeted off...

675
01:05:43,952 --> 01:05:48,412
the Winter River Bridge.

676
01:05:48,490 --> 01:05:51,391
I don't care what it takes.

677
01:05:51,459 --> 01:05:54,087
You get the Deetzes
out of there now!

678
01:05:55,430 --> 01:05:59,696
Wait a minute.
What are you going to do?

679
01:06:01,402 --> 01:06:03,336
To scare them.

680
01:06:03,404 --> 01:06:06,100
I want to make sure
it's not some silly parlor trick.

681
01:06:07,108 --> 01:06:09,633
I'll go first.

682
01:06:30,865 --> 01:06:34,426
Not bad. Not bad.
Now you.

683
01:06:35,637 --> 01:06:37,070
Go ahead!

684
01:06:51,886 --> 01:06:54,081
You look great.

685
01:06:54,155 --> 01:06:59,354
Go clean house and don't forget
the photographs and the handbook.

686
01:07:07,168 --> 01:07:10,137
- Coach?
- What?

687
01:07:10,204 --> 01:07:12,536
I don't think
we survived that crash.

688
01:07:12,607 --> 01:07:14,507
How did you guess?

689
01:07:17,912 --> 01:07:19,903
Mr. and Mrs. Maitland?

690
01:07:24,586 --> 01:07:26,019
Hello!

691
01:07:26,988 --> 01:07:29,479
- How are you?
- Dead.

692
01:07:30,325 --> 01:07:32,691
Dead, dead, deadski.

693
01:07:33,795 --> 01:07:35,695
Of course they're dead.
They're ghosts.

694
01:07:35,763 --> 01:07:40,257
No, I mean they're gone. Split.
Out of here. Afterlife kids.

695
01:07:40,335 --> 01:07:43,793
- Deceased.
- Are you a ghost, too?

696
01:07:44,772 --> 01:07:47,366
I'm the ghost with the most, babe.

697
01:07:49,677 --> 01:07:53,078
You look like somebody
I can relate to.

698
01:07:54,215 --> 01:07:57,480
Maybe you could help me
get out of here.

699
01:07:57,552 --> 01:08:00,146
I gotta tell you,
this death thing--

700
01:08:03,358 --> 01:08:04,791
It's creepy.

701
01:08:04,859 --> 01:08:06,952
Here's my problem.

702
01:08:07,028 --> 01:08:10,589
I've got friends on the outside
I said I'd meet.

703
01:08:10,665 --> 01:08:12,963
I have to be there in person.

704
01:08:13,034 --> 01:08:15,127
So could you help me
get out of here?

705
01:08:16,471 --> 01:08:20,271
- I want to get in.
- Why?

706
01:08:21,976 --> 01:08:25,776
You've probably got your reason,
but I can't do anything from here.

707
01:08:25,847 --> 01:08:30,716
If you could get me out, over there,
maybe we could talk.

708
01:08:30,785 --> 01:08:34,312
But to do that you've got
to say my name three times.

709
01:08:34,389 --> 01:08:36,550
What's your name?

710
01:08:36,624 --> 01:08:39,821
- I can't tell you.
- Why not?

711
01:08:39,894 --> 01:08:44,524
If I tell you, you'll tell your friends,
they'll call me all the time.

712
01:08:44,599 --> 01:08:48,695
I've got to go to shopping centers for
openings, sign autographs, that shit.

713
01:08:48,770 --> 01:08:52,262
It makes my life hell, okay?
A living hell.

714
01:08:52,340 --> 01:08:56,834
But maybe if you have a pen--
I know! Do you play charades?

715
01:08:56,911 --> 01:08:58,811
- Yeah.
- Good.

716
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:00,814
Here we go. Ready?

717
01:09:00,882 --> 01:09:02,873
Two words.

718
01:09:02,950 --> 01:09:04,383
Right!

719
01:09:05,687 --> 01:09:08,451
First word, two syllables.

720
01:09:08,523 --> 01:09:09,956
Look.

721
01:09:10,725 --> 01:09:12,886
Turn around.

722
01:09:13,928 --> 01:09:15,862
I don't know
what your signal means.

723
01:09:15,930 --> 01:09:18,228
Look behind you!

724
01:09:18,299 --> 01:09:20,392
Hi. How are you?

725
01:09:20,468 --> 01:09:21,901
Beetle.

726
01:09:21,969 --> 01:09:23,960
Got it. Now, two.

727
01:09:26,908 --> 01:09:29,536
Breakfast? Orange?
Orange beetle?

728
01:09:29,610 --> 01:09:31,578
Beetle fruit?

729
01:09:31,646 --> 01:09:33,546
Beetle breakfast?

730
01:09:34,382 --> 01:09:35,815
Beetle drink?

731
01:09:38,653 --> 01:09:40,177
Beetle juice?

732
01:09:40,254 --> 01:09:42,848
- That's it!
- Your name's Beetlejuice?

733
01:09:42,924 --> 01:09:46,519
You said it twice.
Just say it once more. Come on.

734
01:09:46,594 --> 01:09:50,257
It was you, wasn't it?
The snake.

735
01:09:50,331 --> 01:09:54,324
You kids and your imagination!
Just say it!

736
01:09:54,402 --> 01:09:58,429
No. I want to talk to Barbara.

737
01:09:58,506 --> 01:10:02,067
You don't need to talk to Barbara!
Just say it!

738
01:10:05,680 --> 01:10:09,207
Adam, I can't go through with it.
I like that little girl.

739
01:10:09,283 --> 01:10:12,912
But it's too late.
We have to go through with this.

740
01:10:12,987 --> 01:10:17,083
No, we don't.
Can't we rebel?

741
01:10:22,497 --> 01:10:24,727
I want to be with Lydia.

742
01:10:35,710 --> 01:10:38,235
Come on!
Just say it!

743
01:10:39,814 --> 01:10:41,441
No, don't say it!

744
01:10:42,650 --> 01:10:44,481
Say it!

745
01:10:44,552 --> 01:10:47,544
It's okay. It's us.
What's going on?

746
01:10:48,689 --> 01:10:50,418
Beetle--

747
01:10:50,491 --> 01:10:54,052
He said if I let him out he would
take me to the other side to find you.

748
01:10:54,128 --> 01:10:57,427
No, Lydia, we're dead.

749
01:10:58,599 --> 01:11:01,363
I want to be dead, too.

750
01:11:09,243 --> 01:11:12,144
Being dead doesn't make things
any easier.

751
01:11:12,213 --> 01:11:17,150
Listen to her on this.
This is something we know a lot about.

752
01:11:17,218 --> 01:11:21,552
And you can visit us
anytime you want.

753
01:11:21,622 --> 01:11:25,388
I have a feeling things are going
to be better from now on.

754
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:28,590
What do you mean, better?

755
01:11:28,663 --> 01:11:33,225
We've decided we're going to invite
you and your family to stay.

756
01:11:33,935 --> 01:11:35,368
That's right.

757
01:11:40,842 --> 01:11:44,175
- Can't we bring Maxie up here?
- You've got a stake in this, too.

758
01:11:44,245 --> 01:11:48,978
This is a presentation. It requires
a sense of occasion, a sense of style.

759
01:11:49,050 --> 01:11:51,678
- It's big. How will we get it out?
- It's sectional.

760
01:11:51,752 --> 01:11:53,617
- Wait, there are plugs.
- Careful!

761
01:11:53,688 --> 01:11:55,121
Okay, go.

762
01:11:56,858 --> 01:11:59,986
- What's going on?
- I don't know. I'll find out.

763
01:12:00,061 --> 01:12:01,494
Be careful.

764
01:12:02,864 --> 01:12:05,332
Ed Cornwell will head
the wax museum...

765
01:12:05,399 --> 01:12:09,495
dedicated to 50 great moments
of the paranormal in Thanksgiving Park.

766
01:12:09,570 --> 01:12:12,334
You must remember Ed.

767
01:12:12,406 --> 01:12:16,172
He's the genius who gave us
the talking Marcel Marceau statue.

768
01:12:17,879 --> 01:12:22,612
And D-Con is on its knees
to sponsor the insect zoo...

769
01:12:22,683 --> 01:12:25,243
in the old hardware store.

770
01:12:25,319 --> 01:12:26,752
We can't lose!

771
01:12:32,994 --> 01:12:37,431
Lydia, you decided to join us. I just
finished the initial presentation.

772
01:12:37,498 --> 01:12:40,490
Now it's time to have a stretch...

773
01:12:40,568 --> 01:12:44,504
and to invite our friends
to meet your friends.

774
01:12:44,572 --> 01:12:46,563
Are they here yet?

775
01:12:46,641 --> 01:12:50,509
Charles, we're here
to see some ghosts.

776
01:12:51,545 --> 01:12:53,843
They're not here...anymore.

777
01:12:58,119 --> 01:13:00,587
Every time she says that,
the paint peels...

778
01:13:00,655 --> 01:13:03,886
and some wild creature
tries to kill us.

779
01:13:05,226 --> 01:13:07,558
But we have pictures, Lydia.

780
01:13:07,628 --> 01:13:10,620
Really. They said they'd come back
and we could all live here...

781
01:13:10,698 --> 01:13:15,795
if you agreed not to tease them
or make them do stupid tricks.

782
01:13:15,870 --> 01:13:18,737
She has a tendency to overreact.

783
01:13:18,806 --> 01:13:23,903
Don't worry, we're not relying on her.
We have Otho.

784
01:13:25,546 --> 01:13:28,982
- Are they still here?
- Otho, are they still here?

785
01:13:29,050 --> 01:13:32,850
They're still here.
They're just hiding out.

786
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:35,514
Probably feel guilty
about what they did to me.

787
01:13:35,589 --> 01:13:37,523
They're sorry they didn't kill you.

788
01:13:37,591 --> 01:13:42,290
- I just want to see them.
- Otho, can you do it?

789
01:13:43,731 --> 01:13:47,599
It'll be tricky,
but I think I can handle it.

790
01:13:51,806 --> 01:13:55,242
What am I worried about?
You can't even change a tire.

791
01:13:58,179 --> 01:14:00,943
I'll be needing
something personal of theirs.

792
01:14:01,015 --> 01:14:03,108
You'll have to go to Goodwill.

793
01:14:06,087 --> 01:14:07,520
Excuse me.

794
01:14:19,934 --> 01:14:22,198
The wedding clothes.

795
01:14:23,471 --> 01:14:25,701
The words

796
01:14:33,114 --> 01:14:35,173
"Hands vermilion

797
01:14:35,249 --> 01:14:37,615

01:14:37,685 --> 01:14:39,118

"To the living,

Barbara?

01:15:09,483 --> 01:15:11,747
"As sudden thunder

805
01:15:13,054 --> 01:15:15,818

"And we rise to be"

809
01:15:44,118 --> 01:15:45,949
Stop it!

810
01:15:48,155 --> 01:15:51,750
"As flies the lizard

811
01:15:51,826 --> 01:15:55,227

"The buried, dead and slain

813
01:16:45,312 --> 01:16:50,147
- What's happening to them?
- I don't know.

814
01:16:51,519 --> 01:16:53,077
They're dying!

815
01:16:53,154 --> 01:16:55,679
They're already dead.
They can't feel a thing.

816
01:16:56,724 --> 01:16:59,818
- That's not true! Look at them!
- That's enough.

817
01:16:59,894 --> 01:17:01,828
Can you stop this?

818
01:17:03,664 --> 01:17:06,656
It's too late, Charles.
I'm sorry.

819
01:17:14,141 --> 01:17:17,872
Where are you?
Help them, please.

820
01:17:20,814 --> 01:17:24,147
Sure, I can help them.
But you've got to help me.

821
01:17:24,218 --> 01:17:27,210
- What?
- I'm what you call an illegal alien.

822
01:17:27,288 --> 01:17:31,816
I want out for good.
To do that, I've gotta get married.

823
01:17:32,893 --> 01:17:36,954
These aren't my rules. Come to think
of it, I don't have any rules.

824
01:17:37,865 --> 01:17:39,799
Come on.

825
01:17:39,867 --> 01:17:42,893
Think of it as a marriage of
inconvenience. We both get something.

826
01:17:42,970 --> 01:17:47,202
I get out, you get the most
eligible bachelor since Valentino.

827
01:17:47,274 --> 01:17:50,641
- We're even.
- Okay, just help them.

828
01:17:53,113 --> 01:17:54,546
Sure.

829
01:18:04,792 --> 01:18:06,885
Beetlejuice.

830
01:18:14,635 --> 01:18:16,728
It's show time.

831
01:18:33,854 --> 01:18:35,788
Attention, K-Mart shoppers.

832
01:18:46,900 --> 01:18:51,633
I'm back. I feel real good about myself.
You know what I mean? So...

833
01:18:51,705 --> 01:18:53,468
without further delay...

834
01:18:54,942 --> 01:18:56,933
welcome to Winter River!

835
01:18:57,011 --> 01:18:59,241
Museum of Natural Greed!

836
01:18:59,313 --> 01:19:01,474
A monument to the bored businessman.

837
01:19:01,548 --> 01:19:05,609
Come a little closer.
Step right up! Test your strength.

838
01:19:27,474 --> 01:19:28,907
Thank you.

839
01:19:28,976 --> 01:19:30,910
Thank you! Whew!

840
01:19:32,079 --> 01:19:36,106
That is why I won't do
two shows a night anymore, babe.

841
01:19:36,183 --> 01:19:37,810
I won't do 'em.

842
01:19:37,885 --> 01:19:41,912
Well, what have we got here
tonight, kids?

843
01:19:43,791 --> 01:19:46,021
We've got the Maitlands.

844
01:19:46,093 --> 01:19:48,755
I think they've had enough exercise
for the night.

845
01:19:56,003 --> 01:19:59,029
Not so fast, round boy.
We're gonna have some laughs.

846
01:20:19,593 --> 01:20:21,527
Mom, Dad.

847
01:20:24,064 --> 01:20:26,931
I just want you to know
you're welcome in our house...

848
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,332
anytime you want to come over.

849
01:20:29,403 --> 01:20:33,339
In the meantime,
the dowry's on me, Dad.

850
01:20:36,543 --> 01:20:41,446
The Maitlands are taken care of.
Everything seems to be back to normal.

851
01:20:46,153 --> 01:20:47,586
Shall we?

852
01:20:57,865 --> 01:21:00,265
Called the caterer.
He's got a great band.

853
01:21:00,334 --> 01:21:03,735
We're gonna need witnesses.
Would you?

854
01:21:53,554 --> 01:21:55,749
Let's get on with the ceremony.

855
01:21:55,823 --> 01:21:57,450
Do you, Betel--

856
01:21:59,026 --> 01:22:03,122
- Nobody says the "B" word.
- Do you take this woman...

857
01:22:03,197 --> 01:22:06,098
to be your wedded wife?

858
01:22:06,166 --> 01:22:08,794
I don't know.
It's a big decision.

859
01:22:08,869 --> 01:22:12,737
I always said if I ever did it,
I was gonna do it only once.

860
01:22:13,707 --> 01:22:15,140
Sure. Go ahead.

861
01:22:15,209 --> 01:22:18,337
And do you, Lydia, take this man--

862
01:22:18,412 --> 01:22:20,141
No! Betel--

863
01:22:21,615 --> 01:22:25,312
She's a little nervous.
Maybe I should answer for her.

864
01:22:25,385 --> 01:22:27,319
I'm Lydia Deetz
and I'm of sound mind.

865
01:22:27,387 --> 01:22:29,912
The man next to me is the one I want.
You asked me.

866
01:22:29,990 --> 01:22:34,017
I'm answering.
Yes, I love that man of mine. Come on.

867
01:22:38,732 --> 01:22:40,029
Come on.

868
01:22:41,235 --> 01:22:43,066
Betelgeu--

869
01:22:48,242 --> 01:22:49,675
Scram!

870
01:22:51,278 --> 01:22:52,711
Come on!

871
01:22:54,214 --> 01:22:55,977
Hey, guy.

872
01:22:58,719 --> 01:23:01,153
May we continue
with the ceremony?

873
01:23:03,857 --> 01:23:05,791
- Then by--
- Betelgeuse.

874
01:23:15,769 --> 01:23:17,168
Strike!

875
01:23:20,240 --> 01:23:21,832
Let's roll!

876
01:23:21,909 --> 01:23:25,140
Then by the authority
vested in me--

877
01:23:25,212 --> 01:23:27,840
- The ring please.
- The ring! Oh, no!

878
01:23:35,889 --> 01:23:38,357
I've got it, honey.

879
01:23:53,740 --> 01:23:56,368
Here it is.
Here you go.

880
01:23:56,443 --> 01:23:59,844
She meant nothing to me.
Nothing at all!

881
01:24:05,819 --> 01:24:08,117
- I now pronounce you--
- Yeah, come on.

882
01:24:09,990 --> 01:24:12,390
Man and--

883
01:25:10,784 --> 01:25:14,584
- What time is it?
- It's about 3:30.

884
01:25:14,655 --> 01:25:16,782
Give or take a year.

885
01:25:23,096 --> 01:25:26,588
Well? Did you get the paints?

886
01:25:26,667 --> 01:25:30,194
Yes. And I took pictures
of the new town hall for you, too.

887
01:25:30,270 --> 01:25:32,204
How was the science test?

888
01:25:32,272 --> 01:25:35,332
It was gross.
They wanted me to dissect a frog.

889
01:25:35,409 --> 01:25:38,867
I told them "no way." I said it was
against my religion. I got a "C."

890
01:25:38,945 --> 01:25:40,879
And the math test?

891
01:25:42,349 --> 01:25:46,911
You're kidding me? We spent
the whole week studying for that test.

892
01:25:46,987 --> 01:25:48,648
I got an "A."

893
01:25:48,722 --> 01:25:50,713
So, can I?

894
01:25:50,791 --> 01:25:54,454
I don't know.
Got a "C" on the science test.

895
01:25:55,562 --> 01:25:58,030
Don't tease her.
You never got on "A" in science--

896
01:26:03,203 --> 01:26:04,864
Come on.

897
01:26:06,173 --> 01:26:08,403
Well...

898
01:26:08,475 --> 01:26:09,908
I suppose.

899
01:26:26,093 --> 01:26:28,584
This reads like stereo instructions.

900
01:26:28,662 --> 01:26:31,096
Sounds like Lydia got an "A"
on the math test.

901
01:26:33,667 --> 01:26:36,192
He likes it.

902
01:27:15,842 --> 01:27:17,639
Sorry. Didn't see you sitting there.

903
01:27:20,113 --> 01:27:22,274
Women.

904
01:27:22,349 --> 01:27:25,580
I don't know what her problem is.

905
01:27:25,652 --> 01:27:27,085
Normally, chicks--

906
01:27:41,701 --> 01:27:43,669
Pardon me.
Did you do that?

907
01:27:43,737 --> 01:27:45,261
Nice work.

908
01:27:45,338 --> 01:27:47,431
How do you get them so small?

909
01:27:47,507 --> 01:27:49,475
There goes Elvis!
Yo, King!

910
01:27:52,245 --> 01:27:56,375
Well, looks like I'm next.

911
01:27:56,449 --> 01:28:01,978
Good thing. I've got to do a photo shoot
for G.Q. in an hour and a half.

912
01:28:02,055 --> 01:28:05,957
They've been after me for months.
Some kind of underwear deal.

913
01:28:07,594 --> 01:28:10,563
What are you doing? Stop it.
You're messing up my hair.

914
01:28:10,630 --> 01:28:13,463
Come on! Whoa! Stop it!

915
01:28:16,303 --> 01:28:19,101
This might be good luck for me.
