<i>People stay until they're forgotten

<i>Mommy Penguin peeped down on Earth
through a hole</i>

4

5
00:01:24,262 --> 00:01:27,899
<i>When the rainy season
started one year later...</i>

6
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:32,900
<i>she secretly hopped on
the Raindrop Train.</i>

7
00:01:39,765 --> 00:01:42,912
<i>The train stopped at a small station.</i>

8
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,200
<i>Suddenly, she heard a baby's cry.</i>

9
00:01:50,156 --> 00:01:56,500
<i>She ran over to find her baby penguin
in a yellow raincoat crying.</i>

10
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:11,500
<i>She held her baby penguin tight.</i>

11
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:15,925
<i>Suddenly, a miracle happened!</i>

12
00:02:21,752 --> 00:02:27,566
<i>Mommy and her baby
always stayed together.</i>

13
00:02:28,269 --> 00:02:30,599
<i>They played games.</i>

14
00:02:31,295 --> 00:02:36,885
<i>Mommy taught her baby
how to fish, and they had fun together.</i>

15
00:02:37,873 --> 00:02:41,135
<i>Soon, the rainy season
was almost over.</i>

16
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:48,157
<i>Raindrop Fairy from Cloudland came
and whispered to Mommy Penguin.</i>

17
00:02:49,632 --> 00:02:55,599
<i>“You must return
before the clouds roll away.”</i>

18
00:02:56,099 --> 00:03:00,419
<i>“If you miss the last Raindrop train,
you can't go back to Cloudland.”</i>

19
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:06,400
<i>“Then you won't be able to watch
your baby through the clouds.”</i>

20
00:03:08,638 --> 00:03:13,325
<i>Mommy was sad, but she didn't cry.</i>

21
00:03:14,301 --> 00:03:18,481
<i>Her baby smiled back at her too.</i>

22
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:27,935
<i>They hugged each other
and said goodbye with a smile.</i>

23
00:03:28,853 --> 00:03:31,598
<i>Mommy Penguin returned to Cloudland</i>

24
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:35,899
<i>and watched her baby every day</i>

25
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:39,000

00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:48,784
<i>She died way too young.</i>

<i>Can the boy's father take care of him?</i>

29
00:03:55,099 --> 00:03:59,329
We warned it'd be
dangerous to have a baby.

30
00:04:00,388 --> 00:04:03,299
She was fine before giving birth.

31
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,979
That's right!

32
00:04:09,407 --> 00:04:11,699

It's time for school!

37

Son!

38
00:07:19,504 --> 00:07:21,692
Did you sleep in her wardrobe again?

39
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:28,848
Let's have breakfast. Wake up!

00:07:36,298 --> 00:07:38,817
<i>It's sunny throughout

<i>The rainy season will begin this weekend.</i>

45
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:54,598
<i>Jeju Island will get heavy downpours.</i>

46
00:07:54,624 --> 00:07:57,208
<i>The seasonal rain front
isn't moving northward...</i>

47
00:07:59,317 --> 00:08:01,599
Does the rainy season start with rain?

48
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,300
- Probably.
- Does it always rain?

49
00:08:06,372 --> 00:08:08,600
It usually comes and goes.

50
00:08:09,673 --> 00:08:11,799
You said it has to rain.

51
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,466
When the rainy season starts...

52
00:08:14,278 --> 00:08:17,799
sometimes it rains
and sometimes it doesn't.

53
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,399
But it has to rain for the
rainy season to start.

54
00:08:22,858 --> 00:08:24,398
What if it rains on Jeju Island?

55
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:28,799
Then the rainy season starts?
It's part of our country too.

56
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,699
Yes. Don't worry.

57
00:08:34,302 --> 00:08:35,788
The rainy season will come.

58
00:08:36,503 --> 00:08:38,120
Hurry up and eat.

59
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:41,677
- Are you excited, too?
- About what?

60
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,899
Mom will come when the
rainy season starts.

61
00:08:52,511 --> 00:08:54,475
- Ji Ho...
- Yes?

62
00:08:57,946 --> 00:08:59,798

66
00:09:33,437 --> 00:09:35,437
- Your medicine!
- Oh, right!

67
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:43,097
- See you later!
- Aren't you hot?

68
00:09:43,123 --> 00:09:45,245
- It might rain.
- See you later.

69
00:10:09,403 --> 00:10:10,581
After school...

70
00:10:10,605 --> 00:10:12,484
I'll go to Uncle Hong Go.

71

- I will.

72

- I will.

85
00:11:19,764 --> 00:11:20,970

86
00:11:24,113 --> 00:11:25,999

87
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,499
Yes, I cleaned everything.

Why are you afraid of

95
00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:59,678

99

Dad can't run, can he?

103
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,599
He can't.

104
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,898
Why can't he do so many things?

105
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:03,699
- Are you going through puberty?
- What's that?

106
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,298
Forget it.

107
00:13:05,299 --> 00:13:08,499
Well, your dad is...

108
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,798
You know the lights that turn on
automatically when you pass by?

109
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:14,199
Yeah, there's one at our front door.

110
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,398
How does it turn on?

111
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:17,798
If I move under it.

112
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:19,298
Right.

113
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:21,999
Does it turn on
if people don't pass by it?

114
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,148
It does.

115
00:13:23,881 --> 00:13:25,199
- It does?
- Yup.

116
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,099
It turns on if a fly or
the wind passes under it.

117
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,499
Why's the light like its owner?

118
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,099
Anyway...

119
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:36,999
if it goes on and off all
the time, what will happen?

120
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,199
It's broken.

121
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,599
- It's broken already?
- Yup.

122
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:45,499
If you're dad works hard all the
time, he'll break down too.

123
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,500
I guess.

124
00:13:46,501 --> 00:13:48,298
So, he can't do everything.

125
00:13:48,299 --> 00:13:51,398
That's why he can't run?

126
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:53,100
It's too hard.

127
00:13:53,629 --> 00:13:54,895
What about driving?

128
00:13:55,729 --> 00:13:57,599
What if he gets in an accident?

129
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,825
And movie theaters?

130
00:13:58,908 --> 00:14:01,500
There's a lot to watch on TV.

131
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,298
But why ask about running?

132
00:14:06,299 --> 00:14:09,700
I'm the class rep for the relay race.

133
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,298

141
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:32,466
Touch right there.

142
00:14:33,841 --> 00:14:36,099
- Feel that bone?
- Yes!

143
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,289
Most people's legs stop there.

144
00:14:40,827 --> 00:14:41,894
Now, touch mine.

145
00:14:43,496 --> 00:14:45,398
I can't feel it!

146
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:47,699
Know why you can't feel my leg bones?

147
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,798
No.

148
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:52,298
My legs don't stop there!
My legs go up to here!

149
00:14:52,299 --> 00:14:53,999
- Like what?
- Penguins!

150
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,499
Then do you think I'll be fast
with these long legs, or not?

151
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,048
- Totally fast!
- You got it!

Why do you look so happy?

155
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:11,148
Uncle Hong Go will run

156
00:15:11,149 --> 00:15:12,577
- The relay race?
- Yes!

157
00:15:12,732 --> 00:15:14,873
We're supposed to run with our dads

158
00:15:14,898 --> 00:15:18,799
but Uncle Hong Go says he's fast
because of his super long legs.

159
00:15:22,365 --> 00:15:24,899
Really? That's great.

160

We got many complaints.

174
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:15,599
Members say it's dark
and the light is flashing.

175
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,700
I'd change it, but I'm afraid of heights.

176
00:16:18,701 --> 00:16:21,034
I can't even change my own light bulbs.

177
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:23,599
Could you hurry it up?

178
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,999
Your son must be waiting.

179
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,099
Isn't there a race every year?

180
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,798

181
00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:31,199
Listen up.

00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,239
When I get the baton and start running

183
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,599
it takes me about three
seconds to reach full speed.

184
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,171
Get it? You hear me?

185
00:16:38,196 --> 00:16:39,921
- So I'll...
- Jeong Ji Ho!

186
00:16:47,974 --> 00:16:51,099
Wow! His legs are really long!

187
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,000
See? I told you!

188
00:16:54,606 --> 00:16:55,899
Still, he can't.

189
00:17:02,227 --> 00:17:04,200
Why's it so small?

190
00:17:08,103 --> 00:17:09,999
Give me the shirt.

191
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,199
Why?

192
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,999
Hurry up.

193
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,499
What's with you?

194
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,942
You're not my dad.

195
00:17:16,965 --> 00:17:24,597
<i>Next up is the family relay run.
Participants, take your positions.</i>

196
00:17:24,924 --> 00:17:26,919
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

197
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:35,285
<i>Next up is the family relay run.
Participants, take your positions.</i>

198
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Daddy!

199
00:17:41,001 --> 00:17:43,795
Son? I can just jog, right?

200
00:17:43,865 --> 00:17:45,795
Sure! I'll run fast!

201
00:17:47,659 --> 00:17:49,518
<i>Let's go, White Team!</i>

202
00:17:49,542 --> 00:17:51,432
<i>Let's go, Blue Team!</i>

203
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,140
Hurry! Faster!

204
00:18:05,711 --> 00:18:07,028
Hurry!

205
00:18:14,423 --> 00:18:16,137
Last runners, get ready!

206
00:18:26,497 --> 00:18:27,497
Ji Ho!

207
00:18:30,761 --> 00:18:32,228
That's it! Go, Ji Ho!

208
00:18:36,634 --> 00:18:37,634
Go! Go! Go!

209
00:18:45,632 --> 00:18:49,955
<i>Go, Blue Team! Go, Blue Team!</i>

210
00:19:40,261 --> 00:19:42,067
<i>Get up, Mister!</i>

211
00:19:42,845 --> 00:19:43,845
Dad!

212
00:20:03,074 --> 00:20:05,429
- I must have embarrassed you.
- No way!

213
00:20:09,853 --> 00:20:11,299
Dad?

214
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:18,233
You'll never leave me, will you?

215
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:28,699
I'm not going anywhere without you.

216
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,989
- Promise?
- Of course!

217
00:20:34,615 --> 00:20:36,298
I swear on Cloudland.

218
00:20:36,299 --> 00:20:37,500
Okay!

219
00:20:43,203 --> 00:20:44,298
I'll carry you.

220
00:20:44,299 --> 00:20:46,598
But you must be tired.

221
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:50,000
I want to carry my son. Get on.

222
00:20:52,763 --> 00:20:53,903
Let's go!

223
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:57,999
Dad?

224
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,199
What?

225
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,299
Let's wash our blankets when we go home.

226
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:05,298
Why?

227
00:21:05,299 --> 00:21:07,653
Uncle Hong Go said then it'll rain.

228
00:21:08,236 --> 00:21:10,095
- Really?
- Yup!

229
00:21:10,782 --> 00:21:12,799
Then let's go home faster.

230
00:21:13,806 --> 00:21:15,272
- Hold tight!
- Okay.

231
00:21:17,339 --> 00:21:18,547
Let's fly!

232
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:24,182
<i>What are you looking for?</i>

233
00:21:24,753 --> 00:21:25,899
<i>A four-leaf clover.</i>

234
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:31,298
<i>You said if we find 10 of them,
a wish will come true.</i>

235
00:21:31,299 --> 00:21:33,299
<i>What's your wish, Ji Ho?</i>

236
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:35,900
<i>For you to be healthy.</i>

237
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:41,199
<i>Thank you, Honey.
Mommy will be healthy.</i>

238
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,999
<i>Promise?</i>

239
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,299
<i>Promise!</i>

240
00:22:18,682 --> 00:22:19,682
Dad!

241
00:22:22,914 --> 00:22:24,499
Dad! It's raining!

242
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,699
What?

243
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,446
Let's go see Mom!

244
00:22:28,449 --> 00:22:30,999
Ji Ho!

245
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,807
You'll catch a cold! Wait!

246
00:22:34,652 --> 00:22:35,652
Ji Ho!

247
00:22:57,047 --> 00:22:58,047
Mom!

248
00:23:00,576 --> 00:23:01,576
Mommy!

249
00:23:03,155 --> 00:23:04,786
Mom! Where are you?

250
00:23:10,021 --> 00:23:13,106
That's weird. Where's Mom?

251
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:16,306
She's not here yet?

252
00:23:28,869 --> 00:23:30,098
Do you want to go now?

253
00:23:30,099 --> 00:23:32,400
No! I'm not leaving.

254
00:23:34,369 --> 00:23:35,702
You'll catch a cold.

255
00:23:36,838 --> 00:23:38,599
I'm not going!

256
00:23:41,905 --> 00:23:45,399
Something must have kept her
from coming today.

257
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,897
Let's come next time.

258
00:23:48,165 --> 00:23:52,069
No! Mom said she would
come with the rain!

259
00:23:54,297 --> 00:23:55,699
Let's go home.

260
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:59,298
No! She said she would come today!

261
00:23:59,299 --> 00:24:05,700
Put me down! Stop it!

262
00:24:25,467 --> 00:24:26,467
What's that?

263
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:32,223
It's Mom!

264
00:24:36,044 --> 00:24:38,899
Why? I want to go to Mom!

265
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:41,999
You wait right here.
I'll go check first.

266
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,259
- No!
- Jeong Ji Ho!

267
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:55,422
Stay back!

268
00:25:03,395 --> 00:25:05,999
It's Mom, right?

269
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,699
Wait.

270
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:10,999
Calm down. Relax.

271
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,598
She could be a ghost.

272
00:25:12,599 --> 00:25:14,900
Who cares? She's Mom.

273
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:18,298
Right.

274
00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:19,499
Mom!

275
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,499
Ji Ho!

276
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,598
Mommy!

277
00:25:22,599 --> 00:25:23,798
No! Don't touch her!

278
00:25:23,799 --> 00:25:25,499
- Mom!
- No!

279
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,838
- Mom!
- Watch out! Stop!

280
00:25:27,505 --> 00:25:30,200
- Ji Ho!
- Mom! Wake up!

281
00:25:41,711 --> 00:25:44,000
See? It's Mom!

282
00:25:46,035 --> 00:25:47,035
Who are you?

283
00:25:47,987 --> 00:25:52,299
Mom? Don't you remember?
It's me, Ji Ho.

284
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:53,900
Mom?

285
00:25:53,901 --> 00:25:55,699
I'm your mom?

286
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,749
Why don't you know me?

287
00:25:57,750 --> 00:26:01,999
You said you'd come back
from Cloudland when it rains.

288
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,595
What does that mean?

289
00:26:04,505 --> 00:26:08,599
Dad! Explain it to her! Come on!

290
00:26:10,942 --> 00:26:12,598
It hurts.

291
00:26:12,599 --> 00:26:16,598
Mom, get up!
I'll show you at home.

292
00:26:16,599 --> 00:26:18,699
- Come on!
- Wait.

293
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:21,099
- Hurry!
- Let's go home.

294
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:35,899
This is you, Mom.

295
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:38,700
You and me. See?

296
00:26:43,567 --> 00:26:44,900
There's more!

297
00:26:56,498 --> 00:26:57,499
Ta-da!

298
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:00,548
I made this for your return.

299
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:02,599
Ji Ho!

300
00:27:04,299 --> 00:27:07,659
I left your things as they are.

301
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:10,399
Go change and get comfortable.

302
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,499
- Don't you need to pee?
- No, I don't.

303
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:15,675
- You should pee. Let's go!
- I don't have to!

304
00:27:19,096 --> 00:27:22,148
Why doesn't Mom
remember anything?

305
00:27:23,556 --> 00:27:26,699
Maybe she hit her head
on the way from Cloudland?

306
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:29,999
I don't think
she knows that either.

307
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,098
What?

308
00:27:31,099 --> 00:27:34,000
That she went to Cloudland.

309
00:27:35,352 --> 00:27:36,352
Oh, really?

310
00:27:40,183 --> 00:27:43,699
<i>Ji Ho, let's keep this a secret.</i>

311
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:44,700
Why?

312
00:27:44,701 --> 00:27:47,899
What if she gets shocked and leaves?

313
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:50,098
Don't ever say
she'll leave again.

314
00:27:50,099 --> 00:27:54,798
Let's pretend
we lived together all along.

315
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:57,934
And don't tell anyone else.
Understand?

316
00:27:59,917 --> 00:28:04,199
If we help her,
Mom will get her memory back.

317
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,239
Okay?

318
00:28:10,346 --> 00:28:12,798
Doesn't Mom look a lot healthier?

319
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:13,999
Yes! And prettier!

320
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,583
Mom's always been pretty.

321
00:28:16,932 --> 00:28:17,932
Let's go.

322
00:28:18,964 --> 00:28:20,499
Excuse me.

323
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:25,199
Did I really live here?

324
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,598
Yes, you lived here.

325
00:28:26,599 --> 00:28:27,999
Right?

326
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,347
- Right?
- Right!

327
00:28:30,034 --> 00:28:36,798
But you mentioned Cloudland
and looked happy to see me.

328
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:38,151
You welcomed me.

329
00:28:38,876 --> 00:28:41,299
And you said you left
my things as they are.

330
00:28:42,567 --> 00:28:45,299
I let the house get messy like this?

331
00:28:51,155 --> 00:28:52,155
Well...

332
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:56,450
You were... Uh...

333
00:28:57,176 --> 00:28:58,176
Sick!

334
00:28:59,271 --> 00:29:00,999
- I was?
- That's right!

335
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,694
You were sick and stayed
in the hospital.

336
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,799
Cloudland Hospital!

337
00:29:06,631 --> 00:29:07,862
Cloudland...

338
00:29:09,144 --> 00:29:11,585
Why was I in the tunnel
and not the hospital?

339
00:29:12,721 --> 00:29:14,231
You got cured yesterday!

340
00:29:17,221 --> 00:29:19,999
Right! You came home yesterday.

341
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,128
- So...
- We played hide-and-seek!

342
00:29:23,429 --> 00:29:24,700
Hide-and-seek?

343
00:29:25,954 --> 00:29:28,837
You love playing that.
You're really good.

344
00:29:28,838 --> 00:29:31,140
- Right, Ji Ho?
- Right! You're the best.

345
00:29:47,071 --> 00:29:48,336
Mom!

346
00:29:49,181 --> 00:29:50,181
Are you okay?

347
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:51,650
See, Dad?

348
00:29:51,651 --> 00:29:53,848
Mom hit her head
on the way down!

349
00:29:53,849 --> 00:29:58,098
Right! A rock must've fallen
and hit you on the head.

350
00:29:58,099 --> 00:30:00,830
- Right! A rock!
- That's why you fainted there.

351
00:30:00,855 --> 00:30:01,855
That's right.

352
00:30:01,881 --> 00:30:03,734
So, you lost your memory.

353
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:05,512
- Right.
- That must be it.

354
00:30:05,538 --> 00:30:07,599
- Right.
- Right.

355
00:30:11,162 --> 00:30:13,907
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

356
00:31:20,313 --> 00:31:22,740
Kid. Come here.

357
00:31:37,886 --> 00:31:40,500
Like father, like son.

358
00:31:42,457 --> 00:31:43,463
Not me.

359
00:31:50,727 --> 00:31:54,899
I made some fried rice for you.
It's in the fridge.

360
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:57,998
Stay home and try to get some rest.

361
00:31:57,999 --> 00:31:59,298
If you overdo yourself...

362
00:31:59,299 --> 00:32:02,599
It's up to me whether I work or lurk.

363
00:32:04,452 --> 00:32:05,980
See you later!

364
00:32:12,589 --> 00:32:13,589
See you.

365
00:33:10,711 --> 00:33:11,711
Mom!

366
00:33:13,003 --> 00:33:14,899
I'm home!

367
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,030
So soon?

368
00:33:16,096 --> 00:33:17,963
My teacher was absent today.

369
00:33:33,858 --> 00:33:34,999
I won.

370
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,607
I let you win.

371
00:33:50,688 --> 00:33:54,298
You're good now.
I won't go easy on you.

372
00:33:54,299 --> 00:33:55,355
Okay.

373
00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:00,117
77, 78, 79...

374
00:34:03,992 --> 00:34:04,992
Barley.

375
00:34:05,403 --> 00:34:06,403
Rice!

376
00:34:10,907 --> 00:34:12,380
Rice! Rice! Rice!

377
00:34:14,083 --> 00:34:15,083
I give up!

378
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
I give up! Mom!

379
00:34:17,001 --> 00:34:18,170
I give up!

380
00:34:20,945 --> 00:34:23,659
Dad! It's okay!
We're just playing.

381
00:34:32,231 --> 00:34:33,427
Aren't you eating?

382
00:34:34,903 --> 00:34:37,499
I want Mom's rice cake skewers.

383
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:41,400
- Mom needs her rest.
- But she's really strong now!

384
00:35:32,762 --> 00:35:33,762
Are you okay?

385
00:35:38,701 --> 00:35:39,701
Yes.

386
00:36:01,481 --> 00:36:04,925
Where's the remote? There it is.

387
00:36:28,503 --> 00:36:30,717
He insisted on sleeping here.

388
00:36:30,742 --> 00:36:34,000
- I'll take him. Ji Ho?
- It's okay.

389
00:36:35,887 --> 00:36:39,300
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

390
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:43,799
- Sleep well, then.
- Wait.

391
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,800
Yes?

392
00:36:44,801 --> 00:36:45,900
Are you going to sleep?

393
00:36:46,856 --> 00:36:49,399
I will in a bit.

394
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:52,099
Then get undressed.

395
00:36:58,492 --> 00:36:59,898
That's what you want?

396
00:37:00,335 --> 00:37:01,536
But Ji Ho is here.

397
00:37:02,711 --> 00:37:04,445
I'll wait for you outside.

398
00:37:05,675 --> 00:37:07,650
She shouldn't overdo it.

399
00:37:08,586 --> 00:37:11,664
- Good thing Ji Ho's asleep.
- What are you doing?

400
00:37:12,878 --> 00:37:13,963
Your legs got burned too?

401
00:37:17,369 --> 00:37:20,831
Oh, you didn't mean that.

402
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,199
I'll put it on for you.

403
00:37:35,869 --> 00:37:36,869
By the way...

404
00:37:38,063 --> 00:37:39,635
I don't remember...

405
00:37:41,324 --> 00:37:45,686
but I guess I'm a mom and a wife...

406
00:37:46,304 --> 00:37:50,899
Don't worry.
You'll get your memory back soon.

407
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,322
It's not that.

408
00:37:54,681 --> 00:37:56,918
I married you for love, right?

409
00:37:59,634 --> 00:38:00,800
Hard to believe?

410
00:38:01,626 --> 00:38:02,938
I'm just curious.

411
00:38:03,445 --> 00:38:05,626
Could you tell me about us?

412
00:38:13,313 --> 00:38:17,172
We first met in high school.

413
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:21,572
We were in the same class
all three years.

414
00:38:22,869 --> 00:38:25,985
<i>You were the top student
in the school.</i>

415
00:38:26,737 --> 00:38:29,698
<i>You had the highest grades
throughout high school.</i>

416
00:38:29,699 --> 00:38:30,899
<i>Was I a loner?</i>

417
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,159
<i>No.</i>

418
00:38:32,815 --> 00:38:37,299
<i>Just someone who was hard
for normal kids to approach.</i>

419
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:41,403
<i>Since I was a student-swimmer,
I only studied for half the day.</i>

420
00:38:41,951 --> 00:38:46,698
<i>And I slept during class,
so we had no chance to talk.</i>

421
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:48,501
<i>Then how did we end up together?</i>

422
00:39:04,907 --> 00:39:07,268
- Saw that?
- Yes!

423
00:39:07,269 --> 00:39:08,518
Swim like that.

424
00:39:08,519 --> 00:39:11,981
If you can swim, go here.
If you can't, go here.

425
00:39:16,822 --> 00:39:18,690
Don't fool around back there!

426
00:39:19,025 --> 00:39:20,025
Look!

427
00:39:22,338 --> 00:39:23,338
Soo Ah!

428
00:39:25,413 --> 00:39:27,286
Oh no! Help her!

429
00:39:32,282 --> 00:39:33,282
What the?

430
00:39:45,418 --> 00:39:46,655
Thank you.

431
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:50,719
<i>I had a crush on you.</i>

432
00:39:53,221 --> 00:39:54,755
Let's solve the third question.

433
00:39:55,414 --> 00:39:57,014
Today's the 23rd, right?

434
00:39:57,773 --> 00:40:02,168
Then Students 13 and 33 can come up.

435
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:33,199
<i>[Norwegian Wood]</i>

436
00:40:39,021 --> 00:40:40,136
Hey!

437
00:40:40,137 --> 00:40:43,499
Stop drinking the herbal decoction.
You'll age faster.

438
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,230
It's okay. I'm baby-faced.

439
00:40:46,014 --> 00:40:48,815
You like her, don't you?

440
00:40:50,744 --> 00:40:52,598
- Who?
- "Who"?

441
00:40:52,599 --> 00:40:53,599
Lim Soo Ah.

442
00:40:54,744 --> 00:40:56,043
It's so obvious, you fool.

443
00:40:56,978 --> 00:40:58,598
- You're crazy.
- Want me to help?

444
00:40:58,599 --> 00:41:01,065
- Help with what?
- Answer quickly. Want help?

445
00:41:02,199 --> 00:41:03,199
Forget it.

446
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,894
I'll ask one last time. Want help?

447
00:41:07,322 --> 00:41:08,965
Fine. Good luck, bro.

448
00:41:14,206 --> 00:41:15,249
I don't believe this!

449
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:17,999
According to my calculations...

450
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
Lim Soo Ah loves you
way more than you do.

451
00:41:21,576 --> 00:41:23,999
Woo Jin loves Soo Ah, 9%.

452
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,499
Soo Ah loves Woo Jin...

453
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:27,500
98%!

454
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:29,598
No way!

455
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:32,235
So just act cool
and uninterested around her.

456
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:34,543
Ask her for a pen,
then she'll say she has one.

457
00:41:34,568 --> 00:41:35,753
Then be chic and say,

458
00:41:37,621 --> 00:41:39,215
"Lend me an eraser," you know!

459
00:41:39,398 --> 00:41:42,672
Then she'll think you're funny
and she'll laugh.

460
00:41:42,697 --> 00:41:44,945
Just go with the flow, bud.

461
00:41:44,969 --> 00:41:46,461
- You get me?
- Yeah.

462
00:41:46,487 --> 00:41:48,420
- You trust me?
- I do.

463
00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:01,315
Hey, Lim Soo Ah?

464
00:42:03,389 --> 00:42:05,500
- Got a pen I can...
- No.

465
00:42:08,318 --> 00:42:09,799
<i>I knew it.</i>

466
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:13,899
She's good at hiding her feelings.

467
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:18,399
You can't rush things.

468
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:22,300
If she likes you more,
she'll come on to you.

469
00:42:23,059 --> 00:42:25,500
Ready?

470
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:32,599
One, two, three! One, two, three!

471
00:42:36,478 --> 00:42:37,943
Jeong Woo Jin!

472
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:40,598
Hey!

473
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:42,499
Can't you get it right?

474
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:43,599
Sorry, Sir.

475
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:46,353
It's because I'm left-footed.

476
00:42:47,269 --> 00:42:50,099
No, you're a left-foot-klutz!

477
00:42:50,885 --> 00:42:52,500
Again!

478
00:42:57,599 --> 00:42:58,599
It wasn't me!

479
00:42:59,561 --> 00:43:00,561
Soo Ah?

480
00:43:01,641 --> 00:43:03,900
- Are you left-footed?
- Yes.

481
00:43:04,481 --> 00:43:08,684
Can you partner up
with the left-foot-klutz?

482
00:43:51,737 --> 00:43:52,737
One!

483
00:43:53,864 --> 00:43:55,222
It's dirty. Oh, no!

484
00:43:55,291 --> 00:43:56,291
It's okay.

485
00:43:58,900 --> 00:43:59,900
What's going on?

486
00:43:59,901 --> 00:44:00,994
Oh no!

487
00:44:08,295 --> 00:44:14,999
<i>We didn't talk again
until our last day of school.</i>

488
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,282
You're not still...

489
00:44:18,403 --> 00:44:20,799
You're over her, right?

490
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:21,811
Shut up.

491
00:44:22,552 --> 00:44:25,070
What? You're not?

492
00:44:25,614 --> 00:44:27,318
- You're crazy!
- Stop it!

493
00:44:27,411 --> 00:44:31,215
- You liked her for three years?
- Shut up!

494
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:32,393
You have a crush!

495
00:44:32,657 --> 00:44:33,657
Stop!

496
00:44:37,106 --> 00:44:38,146
You didn't write yet.

497
00:44:44,630 --> 00:44:45,630
Me?

498
00:44:46,398 --> 00:44:47,398
Right.

499
00:44:49,445 --> 00:44:52,271
- Woo Jin? Got a pen?
- Sure.

500
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:08,800
You can write too, if you want.

501
00:45:10,954 --> 00:45:12,155
Me?

502
00:45:14,351 --> 00:45:15,550
Do it.

503
00:45:16,902 --> 00:45:18,101
Sure.

504
00:45:32,329 --> 00:45:35,217
Soo Ah likes me?

505
00:45:36,990 --> 00:45:38,501
My pen!

506
00:45:40,021 --> 00:45:44,317
<i>I went to a nearby college for swimming.</i>

507
00:45:44,342 --> 00:45:46,799
<i>You went to a university in Seoul.</i>

508
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:50,900
Don't worry, Woo Jin.
Friends matter more than love.

509
00:45:52,074 --> 00:45:54,045
What? I don't like her!

510
00:45:54,070 --> 00:45:55,098
You liar!

511
00:45:55,099 --> 00:45:56,188
<i>Don't you remember?</i>

512
00:46:04,135 --> 00:46:06,596
- It'll come...
- Mom!

513
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:07,726
Mom!

514
00:46:09,077 --> 00:46:12,581
I thought you went back to Cloudland.

515
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:18,190
He means the hospital.

516
00:46:21,833 --> 00:46:26,599
So, we didn't date during high school?

517
00:46:27,635 --> 00:46:29,198
That's right.

518
00:46:29,199 --> 00:46:34,599
Then I tried to call you in our first
summer break from college.

519
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:47,079
<i>Hello?</i>

520
00:46:48,326 --> 00:46:49,838
No! Call her back!

521
00:46:49,938 --> 00:46:51,271
- Call her!
- Move!

522
00:46:53,277 --> 00:46:54,277
Stupid!

523
00:46:56,085 --> 00:46:59,043
<i>After summer break...</i>

524
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:04,826
<i>I wanted to call you during winter break.</i>

525
00:47:05,532 --> 00:47:07,598
<i>[Military duty notice]</i>

526
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:11,581
<i>Just like that, another
two and a half years went by.</i>

527
00:47:28,126 --> 00:47:29,126
<i>Hello?</i>

528
00:47:30,793 --> 00:47:31,793
<i>Hello?</i>

529
00:47:32,612 --> 00:47:33,612
Hang up!

530
00:47:34,030 --> 00:47:35,030
<i>Hello?</i>

531
00:47:37,632 --> 00:47:38,632
You crazy...

532
00:47:40,081 --> 00:47:41,435
<i>Who's this?</i>

533
00:47:41,436 --> 00:47:42,808
Hang up!

534
00:47:42,809 --> 00:47:44,793
<i>- Hello?</i>
- It's Jeong Woo Jin!

535
00:47:48,684 --> 00:47:51,684
Sunghyeon High, Class of '92,
Jeong Woo Jin.

536
00:48:02,135 --> 00:48:05,947
Hi. It's Jeong Woo Jin.

537
00:48:07,431 --> 00:48:10,699
You probably don't remember.

538
00:48:12,527 --> 00:48:18,698
Do you have my pen that
you took on the last day of school?

539
00:48:18,699 --> 00:48:20,699
It was really expensive.

540
00:48:41,353 --> 00:48:43,164
Hong Go!

541
00:48:45,976 --> 00:48:48,236
What do want? Just say anything!

542
00:48:48,237 --> 00:48:50,098
I'll do anything you say!

543
00:48:50,099 --> 00:48:52,519
- Let me style you up.
- Style me?

544
00:49:18,291 --> 00:49:21,000
I'm not late. You came early.

545
00:49:21,822 --> 00:49:22,822
I know.

546
00:49:24,143 --> 00:49:26,534
It's hot. Why didn't you wait inside?

547
00:49:28,170 --> 00:49:29,956
We promised to meet here.

548
00:49:30,516 --> 00:49:32,206
Right. Sorry.

549
00:49:34,016 --> 00:49:35,016
It's okay.

550
00:49:45,958 --> 00:49:48,418
- Thanks.
- Sure.

551
00:49:56,342 --> 00:49:57,646
It's hot, so...

552
00:50:00,759 --> 00:50:01,759
Take care.

553
00:50:04,606 --> 00:50:07,036
Okay. Bye.

554
00:50:12,713 --> 00:50:13,911
Hey, Soo Ah!

555
00:50:16,548 --> 00:50:18,451
Aren't you thirsty?

556
00:50:21,255 --> 00:50:22,255
I am.

557
00:50:52,306 --> 00:50:55,039
Do you live in a dorm at school?

558
00:50:55,525 --> 00:50:56,965
No, I live alone.

559
00:50:58,018 --> 00:50:59,943
That must be tough.

560
00:51:01,969 --> 00:51:03,300
It's better than home.

561
00:51:04,045 --> 00:51:05,561
No one tells me what to do.

562
00:51:06,625 --> 00:51:08,297
That's true.

563
00:51:09,335 --> 00:51:12,523
You can feel trapped
living at home.

564
00:51:12,664 --> 00:51:16,554
I hate it when people
tell me what to do.

565
00:51:17,141 --> 00:51:19,766
It's up to me whether
I work or lurk.

566
00:51:28,695 --> 00:51:31,799
"Work or lurk"?
That's a good one.

567
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:33,469
Why are you laughing?

568
00:51:36,253 --> 00:51:37,253
Well...

569
00:51:43,177 --> 00:51:45,400
<i>[Norway]</i>

570
00:51:46,309 --> 00:51:47,677
Do you like Norway?

571
00:51:48,835 --> 00:51:51,899
Yes, I love it.

572
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:55,999
The great forests and fjord coasts.

573
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,599
Do you like it too?

574
00:51:58,309 --> 00:51:59,309
Not really.

575
00:52:03,864 --> 00:52:07,838
Didn't you read a book
called "Norwegian Wood"?

576
00:52:08,534 --> 00:52:09,534
What?

577
00:52:15,023 --> 00:52:17,198
That's just a novel.

578
00:52:17,199 --> 00:52:19,416
It has nothing to do with Norway.

579
00:52:23,105 --> 00:52:24,799
Actually...

580
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:29,499
I bought it thinking it was
about Norwegian forest cats.

581
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:32,698
It's a type of cat?

582
00:52:32,699 --> 00:52:33,965
Yes, it's so cute.

583
00:52:35,773 --> 00:52:40,198
It's a cat that looks like a dog
and is friendly too.

584
00:52:40,199 --> 00:52:42,349
It has really long and soft fur.

585
00:52:42,431 --> 00:52:43,598
Really?

586
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:46,961
- Do you like cats?
- Of course, I love dogs too.

587
00:52:47,199 --> 00:52:48,199
Me too.

588
00:53:03,889 --> 00:53:05,300
Your bus is here.

589
00:53:08,567 --> 00:53:10,300
I'll see you off and then go.

590
00:53:18,943 --> 00:53:22,099
It's packed.
I'll take the next one.

591
00:53:24,967 --> 00:53:25,967
Really?

592
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:35,983
It's the last bus.
Are you getting on or not?

593
00:53:36,873 --> 00:53:38,139
I'll be going then.

594
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:48,083
I won't be back from Seoul
until winter break.

595
00:54:00,050 --> 00:54:01,420
Look over there!

596
00:54:07,164 --> 00:54:08,998
He's so fast!

597
00:54:11,664 --> 00:54:14,481
Mister! Wait! Stop!

598
00:54:18,579 --> 00:54:20,755
- What are you doing?
- Sorry, sir!

599
00:54:23,853 --> 00:54:24,999
Lim Soo Ah!

600
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,251
Yes?

601
00:54:27,653 --> 00:54:29,952
Can I write you letters?

602
00:54:33,835 --> 00:54:35,514
He's got color mousse?

603
00:54:49,621 --> 00:54:51,833
They must be dating.

604
00:54:54,197 --> 00:54:56,198
Come on! Get off the bus!

605
00:54:56,199 --> 00:54:57,499
Let's go!

606
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:58,899
This isn't Hollywood!

607
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:00,639
- I'll write!
- Get off!

608
00:55:16,132 --> 00:55:18,780
<i>[The rainy season is expected
to last longer than normal.]</i>

609
00:55:24,650 --> 00:55:27,498
- You look so happy.
- Pardon?

610
00:55:28,143 --> 00:55:29,780
Ah, well sort of.

611
00:55:31,958 --> 00:55:34,443
Are you dating someone?

612
00:55:36,815 --> 00:55:38,677
No, why would I be?

613
00:55:45,947 --> 00:55:48,000
You look so happy.

614
00:55:48,956 --> 00:55:50,598
My buttons...

615
00:55:50,599 --> 00:55:52,400
It's so hot.

616
00:55:53,461 --> 00:55:55,199
Are you stupid?

617
00:56:03,730 --> 00:56:05,400
It's raining again.

618
00:56:07,099 --> 00:56:09,098
It's all my dad's fault.

619
00:56:09,099 --> 00:56:10,799
Why?

620
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:15,499
Whenever his car gets washed,
it rains the next day.

621
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:17,699
But he washes it every day.

622
00:56:18,664 --> 00:56:20,899
Our car is American.

623
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:22,900
- You're so lucky!
- You're so lucky!

624
00:56:24,619 --> 00:56:26,699
You're like my dad.

625
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:28,400
How?

626
00:56:28,401 --> 00:56:31,922
He likes rainy days too.
Says cigarettes taste better.

627
00:56:33,264 --> 00:56:35,799
- What about you?
- I hate 'em.

628
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:36,938
Why?

629
00:56:36,974 --> 00:56:39,699
My hair gets curlier.

630
00:58:02,914 --> 00:58:05,375
Woo Jin! Wait!

631
00:58:06,242 --> 00:58:08,030
That's what's urgent?

632
00:58:08,083 --> 00:58:09,299
What's more urgent than this?

633
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:10,800
Forget it.

634
00:58:12,750 --> 00:58:14,899
You saw how pretty she is!

635
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:16,899
She's really classy.

636
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:18,699
I don't care!

637
00:58:21,465 --> 00:58:22,898
I smell something suspicious.

638
00:58:25,943 --> 00:58:27,500
You're in love.

639
00:58:28,597 --> 00:58:29,960
What in the world?

640
00:58:31,717 --> 00:58:34,800
Don't act naive! Who is she?

641
00:58:36,782 --> 00:58:37,999
Forget it.

642
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,598
It's written on your face! Who is she?

643
00:58:40,599 --> 00:58:43,599
I won't tell anyone. Who is she?

644
00:58:44,244 --> 00:58:45,698
- Let go!
- Hey!

645
00:58:45,699 --> 00:58:49,454
I won't steal her from you!
Friendship over love, remember?

646
00:58:58,500 --> 00:58:59,500
Actually...

647
00:58:59,501 --> 00:59:01,376
If you say Soo Ah came back, you're dead!

648
00:59:03,030 --> 00:59:05,698
Be more creative than that!

649
00:59:05,699 --> 00:59:07,999
That's all you can think of?

650
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,300
Say she lost her memory, why don't you?

651
00:59:13,284 --> 00:59:14,485
I got to go.

652
00:59:16,510 --> 00:59:17,809
What's with him?

653
00:59:21,541 --> 00:59:24,598
I'm sorry. My friend's a little shy.

654
00:59:24,599 --> 00:59:26,755
I can't stand guys like him.

655
00:59:29,016 --> 00:59:32,499
Still, he's my friend.

656
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:34,499
No...

657
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:36,099
I meant him.

658
00:59:44,197 --> 00:59:47,900
Must have a reason for being alone.

659
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:49,799
Right.

660
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:50,938
That's gross.

661
00:59:53,391 --> 00:59:55,500
No, I meant you.

662
00:59:57,474 --> 00:59:58,673
Me?

663
01:00:00,719 --> 01:00:04,198
I see it's an
"only one woman for life" case.

664
01:00:04,199 --> 01:00:06,198
Is it written on my face?

665
01:00:06,199 --> 01:00:07,900
Well, I am a romanticist.

666
01:00:08,657 --> 01:00:11,900
Not you. I meant your friend.

667
01:00:16,416 --> 01:00:19,598
Too bad for such...

668
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:22,599
a handsome face.

669
01:00:24,047 --> 01:00:26,699
Right. Woo Jin is
pretty good looking.

670
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:30,799
I meant you.

671
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:33,299
- What?
- You.

672
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:34,500
Me?

673
01:00:42,719 --> 01:00:44,699
Look! It's huge!

674
01:00:46,436 --> 01:00:47,698
What is it?

675
01:00:47,699 --> 01:00:49,598
I can hear better now!

676
01:00:49,599 --> 01:00:51,499
This came from your ear?

677
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:54,219
- Come here, Dad.
- Why?

678
01:00:56,398 --> 01:00:57,799
Lie down.

679
01:00:57,800 --> 01:01:00,500
- Come on! Lie down!
- But...

680
01:01:11,199 --> 01:01:12,500
Dad!

681
01:01:30,684 --> 01:01:34,000
He has some earwax, too.

682
01:01:36,702 --> 01:01:41,099
You have big ear holes
just like Dad.

683
01:01:42,117 --> 01:01:45,599
There's so much.

684
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:48,840
Be careful...

685
01:01:50,804 --> 01:01:52,199
<i>Woo Jin!</i>

686
01:01:53,980 --> 01:01:55,500
<i>Woo Jin!</i>

687
01:01:56,932 --> 01:01:59,599
<i>Jeong Woo Jin!</i>

688
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,000
What?

689
01:02:01,001 --> 01:02:04,824
<i>My buddy, Jeong Woo Jin!</i>

690
01:02:04,885 --> 01:02:05,885
Hong Go?

691
01:02:05,965 --> 01:02:07,338
What's with you?

692
01:02:07,373 --> 01:02:11,222
Buddy! If you die, I can't live!

693
01:02:11,284 --> 01:02:13,599
Why would I die?

694
01:02:14,199 --> 01:02:15,698
Ji Ho, Mommy's here!

695
01:02:15,699 --> 01:02:16,949
You're drunk!

696
01:02:17,795 --> 01:02:22,153
- Go home and sleep!
- I came back from Cloudland!

697
01:02:22,378 --> 01:02:23,378
Go!

698
01:02:24,432 --> 01:02:25,800
Sorry, Bro.

699
01:02:26,739 --> 01:02:27,739
Damn.

700
01:02:28,911 --> 01:02:30,605
- Stop.
- Why?

701
01:02:30,630 --> 01:02:32,099
You can't go out.

702
01:02:37,563 --> 01:02:38,598
Why not?

703
01:02:38,599 --> 01:02:39,799
Uncle Hong Go is weird.

704
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:40,873
How?

705
01:02:42,298 --> 01:02:44,000
His head is too big.

706
01:02:48,961 --> 01:02:49,961
Where'd he go?

707
01:02:54,163 --> 01:02:55,163
Hey!

708
01:02:55,331 --> 01:02:59,300
Soo Ah wasn't strikingly beautiful!

709
01:02:59,324 --> 01:03:02,300
Her body wasn't to die for!

710
01:03:05,978 --> 01:03:07,698
Why, you little...

711
01:03:07,699 --> 01:03:09,617
Let's talk outside!

712
01:03:13,168 --> 01:03:14,168
Holy cow.

713
01:03:15,128 --> 01:03:16,862
Remember? This is Hong Go.

714
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:20,108
He's quite drunk.

715
01:03:22,297 --> 01:03:25,499
Would you like some water?

716
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:28,399
Why is he dressed like a penguin?

717
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:29,976
Soo Ah!

718
01:03:30,552 --> 01:03:33,802
I'll explain everything!
Don't tell anyone!

719
01:03:33,827 --> 01:03:36,400
- Soo Ah! It's Soo Ah!
- Your water.

720
01:03:38,353 --> 01:03:39,353
Hong Go!

721
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:42,698
Stay back!

722
01:03:42,699 --> 01:03:44,299
Our Father, who art in heaven

723
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:46,899
hallowed be thy name.

724
01:03:46,900 --> 01:03:48,399
Thy kingdom come...

725
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:50,499
thy will be done...

726
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:54,000
on earth, as it is in heaven?

727
01:03:56,007 --> 01:03:57,499
I'm so sorry!

728
01:03:57,500 --> 01:04:00,399
Forgive me! I won't do it again!

729
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:03,999
I won't set him up
on blind dates again!

730
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,598
So please forgive me!

731
01:04:05,599 --> 01:04:07,661
I'm sorry!

732
01:04:10,740 --> 01:04:11,740
Be careful!

733
01:04:15,088 --> 01:04:16,900
He's not a bad guy.

734
01:04:18,168 --> 01:04:20,800
- So?
- What?

735
01:04:21,978 --> 01:04:25,698
You said you'd write. Then what?

736
01:04:25,699 --> 01:04:26,782
What?

737
01:04:30,911 --> 01:04:31,960
I wrote to you.

738
01:05:48,001 --> 01:05:49,400
Are you cold?

739
01:05:51,076 --> 01:05:52,076
What?

740
01:05:53,239 --> 01:05:55,299
Are your hands cold?

741
01:05:55,300 --> 01:05:56,500
No.

742
01:05:57,949 --> 01:05:59,800
Why wear gloves?

743
01:06:02,135 --> 01:06:03,599
I'm not.

744
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:44,476
Were you in a fight?

745
01:07:45,969 --> 01:07:48,598
I fell off my bike.

746
01:07:48,599 --> 01:07:51,598
You need ointment. I'll get it.

747
01:07:51,599 --> 01:07:52,628
It's okay.

748
01:07:53,771 --> 01:07:56,293
Let's just stay like this.

749
01:08:01,170 --> 01:08:02,699
Mom?

750
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:08,599
No cheating, okay?

751
01:08:29,576 --> 01:08:31,600
Are we there yet?

752
01:08:32,365 --> 01:08:33,899
Almost.

753
01:08:42,302 --> 01:08:43,559
We're here.

754
01:08:45,735 --> 01:08:47,582
There's nothing here.

755
01:08:58,408 --> 01:08:59,984
This is it?

756
01:09:19,761 --> 01:09:20,761
Look!

757
01:09:27,943 --> 01:09:30,699
It's a movie theater!

758
01:09:37,699 --> 01:09:39,176
Here.

759
01:09:41,103 --> 01:09:42,103
Want to see?

760
01:09:56,103 --> 01:09:57,103
Wow!

761
01:10:03,341 --> 01:10:04,341
Turn up the volume.

762
01:10:04,875 --> 01:10:05,875
Sorry.

763
01:10:06,182 --> 01:10:08,363
- I'll turn it off.
- What?

764
01:10:09,318 --> 01:10:10,437
Fine.

765
01:10:10,438 --> 01:10:13,914
- Let's watch together!
- It's too small to share.

766
01:10:15,024 --> 01:10:16,024
Wait!

767
01:10:17,686 --> 01:10:18,686
I can see.

768
01:10:24,231 --> 01:10:25,926
- This way.
- Wait.

769
01:10:58,456 --> 01:10:59,726
What's this?

770
01:12:39,484 --> 01:12:41,506
<i>[My birthday]</i>

771
01:12:55,555 --> 01:12:56,898
Don't lie!

772
01:12:56,899 --> 01:12:59,499
- I'm not lying!
- Seriously?

773
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:02,800
Don't tell anyone, okay?

774
01:13:03,528 --> 01:13:04,728
Promise.

775
01:13:13,203 --> 01:13:14,999
I made this?

776
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
<i>[Mommy Penguin in Cloudland]</i>

777
01:13:28,341 --> 01:13:29,546
It's cute.

778
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:37,198
Barley, barley, rice!

779
01:13:37,199 --> 01:13:38,800
You're so good!

780
01:13:40,470 --> 01:13:41,898
Again!

781
01:13:41,899 --> 01:13:43,198
- I'll catch you!
- Barley...

782
01:13:43,199 --> 01:13:44,799
<i>Ready, go!</i>

783
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:46,799
Ji Ho, don't hurt Mommy!

784
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:48,398
Stop!

785
01:13:48,399 --> 01:13:50,398
Ji Ho! Wait! I'm sorry!

786
01:13:50,399 --> 01:13:51,921
- Stop!
- Don't hurt Daddy!

787
01:13:54,671 --> 01:13:55,999
Give up! Give up!

788
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,600
We give up!

789
01:14:12,073 --> 01:14:13,699
What's that for?

790
01:14:15,311 --> 01:14:17,999
It's to ask for more rain.

791
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,500
Why?

792
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,899
Because I love rainy days!

793
01:14:37,493 --> 01:14:39,198
- Dad!
- What?

794
01:14:39,199 --> 01:14:41,698
What's that over there? Over there!

795
01:14:41,699 --> 01:14:42,899
Jeong Woo Jin!

796
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:47,663
Ji Ho! We did it!

797
01:14:50,912 --> 01:14:52,238
Let's run away!

798
01:15:09,055 --> 01:15:11,599
- Are you having fun?
- Yes!

799
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:15,000
- But it must be hard on Dad.
- No, I'm fine!

800
01:15:16,896 --> 01:15:19,099
Dad! Faster!

801
01:15:19,100 --> 01:15:20,920
Faster? Let's go!

802
01:15:22,686 --> 01:15:24,398
Ji Ho, we're home!

803
01:15:24,399 --> 01:15:26,680
What did you wish for?

804
01:15:26,681 --> 01:15:28,898
It's a secret.

805
01:15:28,899 --> 01:15:30,578
Let's go wash up.

806
01:15:33,122 --> 01:15:34,122
Dad!

807
01:15:36,244 --> 01:15:37,244
Dad!

808
01:15:49,445 --> 01:15:51,199
Why didn't you tell me?

809
01:15:55,448 --> 01:15:57,500
What's wrong with you?

810
01:16:04,006 --> 01:16:06,039
When did it start?

811
01:16:09,791 --> 01:16:14,359
After our third date.

812
01:16:21,445 --> 01:16:24,039
Go on in. Take care.

813
01:16:25,362 --> 01:16:26,807
Wait.

814
01:16:30,795 --> 01:16:34,560
Good luck at the national tryouts.
Don't get hurt.

815
01:16:40,034 --> 01:16:41,891
No, I mean... Here.

816
01:18:08,837 --> 01:18:15,898
<i>Doctors said there's a problem
in my brain that controls hormones.</i>

817
01:18:15,899 --> 01:18:22,599
<i>I got treatment and pills,
but it only got worse.</i>

818
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:27,572
<i>If I got nervous or strained myself,
I kept fainting.</i>

819
01:18:28,707 --> 01:18:31,699
<i>Everything came to an end.</i>

820
01:18:32,759 --> 01:18:37,439
<i>Not just swimming,
but living a normal life, too.</i>

821
01:18:40,355 --> 01:18:41,422
How have you been?

822
01:18:49,104 --> 01:18:50,104
Fine...

823
01:18:51,376 --> 01:18:52,643
You've lost weight.

824
01:18:55,862 --> 01:18:57,100
No, I didn't.

825
01:19:00,069 --> 01:19:03,499
I heard you quit swimming.

826
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:06,144
Yeah. I have other plans.

827
01:19:14,173 --> 01:19:16,314
Is something wrong?

828
01:19:17,576 --> 01:19:21,499
It's nothing like that.

829
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:22,938
Please...

830
01:19:24,363 --> 01:19:26,699
- Don't hide it.
- I'm not hiding anything.

831
01:19:29,594 --> 01:19:31,898
I just...

832
01:19:31,899 --> 01:19:33,581
don't like you anymore.

833
01:19:39,939 --> 01:19:41,426
Really?

834
01:19:42,680 --> 01:19:44,604
Just your feelings for me changed?

835
01:19:45,939 --> 01:19:48,053
Nothing bad happened, right?

836
01:19:48,054 --> 01:19:49,804
Of course not.

837
01:19:51,779 --> 01:19:53,353
That's good.

838
01:20:00,863 --> 01:20:02,555
From now on...

839
01:20:04,958 --> 01:20:06,737
let's not see each other.

840
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:31,099
<i>Then, for a year,
I struggled to get over you.</i>

841
01:20:31,100 --> 01:20:33,999
<i>But I couldn't.</i>

842
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:39,299
<i>It was really dangerous
for me to go to Seoul alone...</i>

843
01:20:39,300 --> 01:20:43,429
<i>but if I could see you
just one more time...</i>

844
01:20:43,430 --> 01:20:45,565
<i>I didn't care what happened to me.</i>

845
01:21:18,864 --> 01:21:23,349
<i>Seeing you happy,
I felt a little sad.</i>

846
01:21:23,350 --> 01:21:26,398
<i>Still, I was relieved.</i>

847
01:21:26,399 --> 01:21:30,218
<i>I knew that I wasn't
good enough for you.</i>

848
01:21:30,219 --> 01:21:32,500
<i>I realized that for good.</i>

849
01:21:35,877 --> 01:21:39,322
<i>We didn't talk to each other after that.</i>

850
01:21:40,467 --> 01:21:42,881
<i>I thought it was completely over.</i>

851
01:21:43,628 --> 01:21:46,654
<i>Then, a few months later...</i>

852
01:21:50,500 --> 01:21:51,800
Hello?

853
01:21:52,704 --> 01:21:57,199
<i>I mulled over whether
to meet you again or not.</i>

854
01:21:59,029 --> 01:22:02,499
<i>My head was telling me to go back</i>

855
01:22:02,500 --> 01:22:06,229
<i>but my heart would not let me go.</i>

856
01:22:23,654 --> 01:22:25,799
Soo Ah, I...

857
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:26,999
Don't worry.

858
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,756
We'll be fine. It's meant to be.

859
01:23:09,697 --> 01:23:13,738
Soon after, I proposed to you.

860
01:23:14,668 --> 01:23:18,243
You said you hated
every minute we were apart...

861
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:22,448
and asked me to propose soon.

862
01:23:24,688 --> 01:23:27,001
That means I proposed first.

863
01:23:27,002 --> 01:23:32,092
If you didn't say that,
I wouldn't have dreamed of marriage.

864
01:23:33,252 --> 01:23:37,069
Despite your parents being against it...

865
01:23:38,359 --> 01:23:43,800
you quit grad school and married me.

866
01:23:44,789 --> 01:23:48,456
Then, Ji Ho was born.

867
01:23:57,189 --> 01:24:03,199
Can we live happily ever after like this?

868
01:24:07,698 --> 01:24:09,300
Of course.

869
01:24:20,311 --> 01:24:22,398
- A school concert?
- Yes.

870
01:24:22,399 --> 01:24:23,999
You're in it, too?

871
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,322
Yeah, our whole class is singing.

872
01:24:26,323 --> 01:24:27,867
That sounds fun!

873
01:24:27,868 --> 01:24:32,399
- Will you come, Mom?
- Of course! I want to see you sing!

874
01:24:34,301 --> 01:24:35,398
You'll go too, right?

875
01:24:35,399 --> 01:24:36,698
Right, of course.

876
01:24:36,699 --> 01:24:38,198
It's the forecast!

877
01:24:38,199 --> 01:24:40,712
<i>This year's rainy season
is unusually long.</i>

878
01:24:40,737 --> 01:24:41,999
<i>It will end in about two weeks.</i>

879
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:43,198
Hurry up and eat.

880
01:24:43,199 --> 01:24:47,042
<i>The rain clouds are
concentrated in the central...</i>

881
01:24:49,201 --> 01:24:52,000
- Why turn it off?
- It was too loud.

882
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,331
Hurry up and eat. You'll be late.

883
01:25:13,768 --> 01:25:14,768
Lim Soo Ah?

884
01:25:15,878 --> 01:25:16,878
That's me.

885
01:25:58,384 --> 01:26:00,398
Daddy's home.

886
01:26:00,399 --> 01:26:01,599
It's too hard.

887
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:05,698
Don't hold it tightly.
Let's practice again.

888
01:26:05,699 --> 01:26:08,099
Hold it gently and tap.

889
01:26:08,100 --> 01:26:09,699
Not too hard.

890
01:26:13,363 --> 01:26:15,999
See? You can do it!

891
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,698
- You can make it yourself, right?
- Yes!

892
01:26:18,699 --> 01:26:20,688
That's my boy!

893
01:26:22,137 --> 01:26:23,621
Ji Ho! Daddy's home.

894
01:26:23,622 --> 01:26:26,799
Dad! I made fried eggs!

895
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:29,799
Really? That's awesome!

896
01:26:29,800 --> 01:26:31,799
He's so good!

897
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:33,500
Want to try again?

898
01:26:35,909 --> 01:26:37,959
- Daddy?
- Yes?

899
01:26:37,960 --> 01:26:41,099
Did you put up a four-leaf clover?

900
01:26:41,100 --> 01:26:42,398
No.

901
01:26:42,399 --> 01:26:46,100
There were eight before.
Now, there are nine.

902
01:26:46,899 --> 01:26:48,826
Did Mom put it up?

903
01:26:57,061 --> 01:27:04,198
<i>[You must return
before the clouds roll away.]</i>

904
01:27:11,908 --> 01:27:15,827
<i>It will come someday.</i>

905
01:27:15,828 --> 01:27:19,609
<i>The day of my dreams.</i>

906
01:27:19,610 --> 01:27:22,698
I'm good at running.

907
01:27:22,699 --> 01:27:25,898
I'm the fastest runner in my class.

908
01:27:25,899 --> 01:27:29,500
I'm going to win a gold medal
at the Olympics.

909
01:27:35,470 --> 01:27:36,852
Ji Ho.

910
01:27:36,853 --> 01:27:39,300
Concentrate and do it right.

911
01:27:43,734 --> 01:27:45,299
Let's try it again.

912
01:27:45,300 --> 01:27:46,640
Okay, Son?

913
01:27:48,841 --> 01:27:49,841
Here.

914
01:27:49,850 --> 01:27:53,099
Hold on tight and shake it twice.

915
01:27:53,100 --> 01:27:56,231
Turning it to full power
won't help suck up all the dust.

916
01:27:59,859 --> 01:28:00,859
That's good.

917
01:28:02,117 --> 01:28:06,499
Don't use your nails.
Rub gently.

918
01:28:06,500 --> 01:28:07,859
Like this?

919
01:28:07,860 --> 01:28:10,898
Yes! Scrub everywhere.

920
01:28:10,899 --> 01:28:13,078
That's good!

921
01:28:14,796 --> 01:28:17,904

922
01:28:19,596 --> 01:28:20,930
<i>Why do you say that?</i>

923
01:28:21,572 --> 01:28:27,045

lays an egg and goes away for food...</i>

924
01:28:27,046 --> 01:28:33,699
<i>the daddy incubates it on its feet

925
01:28:34,324 --> 01:28:36,286
<i>That's amazing.</i>

926
01:28:38,175 --> 01:28:40,117
<i>We have a problem.</i>

927

<i>- Take Ji Ho. Hurry.
- Why?</i>

928
01:28:43,869 --> 01:28:46,587
<i>I have to poo. Hurry! Take him!</i>

929
01:28:46,613 --> 01:28:49,939
<i>The emperor penguin
holds it for two months!</i>

930
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:54,306
<i>Ji Ho's awake. He's not crying.
Still, hold it!</i>

931
01:28:54,909 --> 01:28:56,109
<i>Come on! Take him!</i>

932
01:29:01,373 --> 01:29:04,785
<i>Who am I?</i>

933
01:29:04,786 --> 01:29:07,464
<i>Ji Ho is smiling!</i>

934
01:29:07,465 --> 01:29:11,299
<i>Look at Mommy!</i>

935
01:29:11,300 --> 01:29:12,694
<i>Ji Ho!</i>

936
01:29:19,305 --> 01:29:21,338
<i>Daddy did it.</i>

937
01:29:22,210 --> 01:29:24,212
<i>Stay still, then.</i>

938
01:29:28,828 --> 01:29:30,496
<i>Ji Ho! Hold Mommy's hand!</i>

939
01:29:47,426 --> 01:29:50,721
You stayed up every night and did this?

940
01:29:53,369 --> 01:29:56,499
Since I saw her,
I can't even get mad!

941
01:29:56,500 --> 01:29:57,958
Man!

942
01:29:59,435 --> 01:30:02,781
Will this stop Soo Ah from going?

943
01:30:02,782 --> 01:30:05,586
When the rain stops,
doesn't she have to go?

944
01:30:05,587 --> 01:30:08,805
I have to at least try.

945
01:30:09,467 --> 01:30:11,208
Of course.

946
01:30:24,104 --> 01:30:25,104
Hello?

947
01:30:36,952 --> 01:30:38,086
See for yourself.

948
01:30:39,877 --> 01:30:43,661
Somebody kept putting soap on our car.

949
01:30:43,662 --> 01:30:46,795
We caught him using a scrubbing pad!

950
01:30:48,250 --> 01:30:50,703
Ji Ho? Did you really do that?

951
01:30:54,253 --> 01:30:57,599
Hold your head up.
Did you do it?

952
01:30:57,600 --> 01:30:59,845
My son saw him.

953
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:04,149
Why'd you do it?

954
01:31:05,994 --> 01:31:08,757
Tell me why you did this.

955
01:31:12,431 --> 01:31:13,855
You won't tell me?

956
01:31:19,806 --> 01:31:23,299
I'm sorry.
I'll punish him at home.

957
01:31:23,300 --> 01:31:25,999
I'll pay for damages.
Please let me know.

958
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:30,399
I'll say this because
I'm worried as a parent, too.

959
01:31:31,268 --> 01:31:34,816
I think Ji Ho may have
emotional problems.

960
01:31:34,817 --> 01:31:38,787
He should get therapy
before it's too late.

961
01:31:38,788 --> 01:31:43,198
I'm sure you're doing
the best you can...

962
01:31:43,199 --> 01:31:46,672
but it shows when kids don't have a mom.

963
01:31:50,671 --> 01:31:51,671
I'm sorry.

964
01:32:00,851 --> 01:32:01,851
Let's go.

965
01:32:16,530 --> 01:32:18,136
Why are you crying?

966
01:32:20,569 --> 01:32:23,198
Seo Bin...

967
01:32:23,199 --> 01:32:31,256
He said if his dad's car
gets washed, it always rains.

968
01:32:32,655 --> 01:32:36,599
Mom's not leaving, right?

969
01:32:36,600 --> 01:32:42,198
We can hold her
and stop her from going, right?

970
01:32:42,199 --> 01:32:47,000
We can't let her go again!

971

01:33:39,926 --> 01:33:40,926
How can I help...

974
01:33:43,543 --> 01:33:46,823
Don't worry. I won't bite.

975
01:33:50,918 --> 01:33:53,965
I came to ask you for a favor.

976
01:34:06,331 --> 01:34:09,999
What favor, Ma'am?
I mean, Soo Ah.

977
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:13,949
First, I apologize for the
"not beautiful" and "hot body" comments.

978
01:34:13,975 --> 01:34:15,887
I didn't mean it.

979
01:34:18,896 --> 01:34:20,300
What's this?

980
01:34:27,698 --> 01:34:31,600
You won't close this bakery
anytime soon, right?

981
01:34:32,537 --> 01:34:34,000
Why?

982
01:34:35,502 --> 01:34:39,420
The favor will take a long time.

983
01:35:08,435 --> 01:35:09,899
Ji Ho!

984
01:35:11,104 --> 01:35:12,104

Ji Ho! It's raining!
Why'd you come out?

987
01:35:18,551 --> 01:35:20,499
Where were you?

988
01:35:20,500 --> 01:35:24,300
I went to Uncle Hong Go's to buy a cake.

989
01:35:30,916 --> 01:35:32,999
- There!
- Now, let's sing!

990
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:34,799

I'm sorry...

1072
01:47:15,600 --> 01:47:18,899
for not recognizing you sooner.

1073
01:47:47,702 --> 01:47:50,899

1074
01:47:52,569 --> 01:47:54,952
What? Why, Ji Ho?

1075
01:47:54,953 --> 01:47:57,299
It's because of me.

1076
01:47:57,300 --> 01:47:59,448
You died because of me.

1077
01:47:59,449 --> 01:48:02,581
What? Who said that?

1078
01:48:02,582 --> 01:48:09,499
I heard your relatives say
you were sick because of me.

01:48:09,500 --> 01:48:10,813
I'm sorry.

1080
01:48:10,814 --> 01:48:13,826
If I knew, I would've been a better son.

1081
01:48:13,827 --> 01:48:15,600
Don't say that.

1082
01:48:16,689 --> 01:48:19,791
I was so happy because of you.

1083
01:48:19,792 --> 01:48:26,500
Still, if I wasn't born,
you could have lived longer with Dad.

1084
01:48:28,466 --> 01:48:32,399
That's not true, Ji Ho.

1085
01:48:35,264 --> 01:48:41,999
I would have been the same
even if you weren't born.

1086
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:43,618
And...

1087
01:48:43,619 --> 01:48:50,100
I wouldn't have been happy
without you even if I lived to be 100.

01:49:11,500 --> 01:49:14,600
So I'm very thankful for you.

1093
01:49:16,418 --> 01:49:18,799
Really?

1094
01:49:18,800 --> 01:49:20,100
Yes.

1095
01:49:22,509 --> 01:49:24,000
Ji Ho...

1096
01:49:25,746 --> 01:49:31,976
Mommy will go to Cloudland
and keep watching you.

1097
01:49:32,734 --> 01:49:34,500
Grow up well.

1098
01:49:35,567 --> 01:49:38,600
And protect Daddy like you promised.

1099
01:49:39,886 --> 01:49:43,800
I'll never forget you, Mom.

1100
01:49:45,896 --> 01:49:47,898
Good.

1101
01:49:47,899 --> 01:49:49,699
Thank you.

1102
01:50:01,371 --> 01:50:05,399
<i>I wonder how Ji Ho will grow up.</i>

1103
01:50:07,067 --> 01:50:12,100
Since he resembles you,
I'm sure he'll be handsome.

1104
01:50:23,752 --> 01:50:25,198
<i>Soo Ah...</i>

1105
01:50:25,199 --> 01:50:26,399
Yes?

1106
01:50:27,399 --> 01:50:28,800
I'm sorry.

1107
01:50:29,820 --> 01:50:30,898
For what?

1108
01:50:30,899 --> 01:50:33,599
I really...

1109
01:50:33,600 --> 01:50:36,199
wanted to make you happy.

1110
01:50:40,332 --> 01:50:42,399
Can't you see I'm happy?

1111
01:50:44,462 --> 01:50:48,100
I was more than happy
just being with you.

1112
01:50:49,436 --> 01:50:52,000
So don't ever feel sorry.

1113
01:50:53,796 --> 01:50:56,819
Soo Ah... Please, wait...

1114
01:51:06,199 --> 01:51:08,000
Take good care of Ji Ho.

1115
01:51:10,367 --> 01:51:12,899
Love him lots for me, too.

1116
01:51:13,707 --> 01:51:17,121
Wait, Soo Ah... I'm coming.

1117
01:51:17,122 --> 01:51:20,084
Hold on, please...

1118
01:51:20,085 --> 01:51:22,000
Soo Ah...

1119
01:51:23,877 --> 01:51:27,699
I'll be right there.

1120
01:51:33,444 --> 01:51:34,800
Soo Ah...

1121
01:51:40,604 --> 01:51:41,999
Soo Ah...

1122
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:43,697
Soo Ah!

1123
01:51:49,965 --> 01:51:51,800
Soo Ah!

1124
01:51:52,981 --> 01:51:56,899
Stay by Ji Ho's side
for a long, long time.

1125
01:52:01,805 --> 01:52:05,300
When you feel like
you're a burden to him...

1126
01:52:07,078 --> 01:52:09,600
then come meet me at Cloudland.

1127
01:52:14,537 --> 01:52:16,699
I'll save you a spot beside me.

1128
01:52:58,140 --> 01:52:59,600
Dad!

1129
01:53:52,492 --> 01:53:54,398
- Dad!
- Yeah?

1130
01:53:54,399 --> 01:53:58,100
Wow! You're better than me now!
Let's eat.

1131
01:53:59,137 --> 01:54:00,358
Ketchup!

1132
01:54:02,817 --> 01:54:04,217
Let's eat.

1133
01:54:14,342 --> 01:54:15,853
There.

1134
01:54:16,362 --> 01:54:17,699
Ji Ho! Let's go!

1135
01:54:43,210 --> 01:54:44,539
Hold tight, Son!

1136
01:55:06,288 --> 01:55:09,368
Yay! My dad won!

1137
01:55:14,283 --> 01:55:15,561
Next!

1138
01:55:17,640 --> 01:55:20,100
Tense up your belly!

1139
01:55:22,858 --> 01:55:23,858
Next!

1140
01:55:25,082 --> 01:55:26,858
That's good.

1141
01:56:12,041 --> 01:56:15,100
<i>March 2nd, 1990.</i>

1142
01:56:15,997 --> 01:56:18,319
<i>The unthinkable happened.</i>

1143
01:56:49,721 --> 01:56:55,000
<i>I started liking someone.</i>

1144
01:56:57,400 --> 01:57:00,299
What a great first impression.

1145
01:57:00,300 --> 01:57:03,055
Late on your first day of school?

1146
01:57:03,056 --> 01:57:04,237
What's your name?

1147
01:57:04,238 --> 01:57:05,596
Jeong Woo Jin, Sir.

1148
01:57:05,597 --> 01:57:07,062
Woo Jin?

1149
01:57:07,063 --> 01:57:10,198
You're the swimmer student?
Don't be late next time.

1150
01:57:10,199 --> 01:57:15,099
<i>And he's in my class.</i>

1151
01:57:15,100 --> 01:57:17,010
See that?

1152
01:57:17,011 --> 01:57:20,398
If you can swim, go here.
If you can't, go here.

1153
01:57:20,399 --> 01:57:23,327
Hurry! Come on!

1154
01:57:24,426 --> 01:57:26,499
Stop right there.

1155
01:57:26,500 --> 01:57:27,500
Go!

1156
01:57:27,501 --> 01:57:29,014
Come here!

1157
01:57:29,015 --> 01:57:30,029
Help her!

1158
01:57:34,301 --> 01:57:35,301
Thank you.

1159
01:57:37,721 --> 01:57:38,944
<i>How embarrassing.</i>

1160
01:57:47,404 --> 01:57:48,404
Hey, Lim Soo Ah.

1161
01:57:50,162 --> 01:57:52,300
- Got a pen I can...
- No.

1162
01:57:53,645 --> 01:57:54,645
<i>Stupid.</i>

1163
01:57:59,122 --> 01:58:03,499
<i>I purposely got the steps wrong
to be his partner.</i>

1164
01:58:03,500 --> 01:58:06,037
Can you partner up
with the left-foot-klutz?

1165
01:58:14,158 --> 01:58:15,740
- It got dirty!
- It's okay.

1166
01:58:15,765 --> 01:58:16,765
I'm sorry.

1167
01:58:21,820 --> 01:58:23,146
<i>What's wrong with me?</i>

1168
01:58:24,426 --> 01:58:26,037
For three years!

1169
01:58:28,282 --> 01:58:29,412
Come on!

1170
01:58:30,900 --> 01:58:32,756
You can write too, if you want.

1171
01:58:34,643 --> 01:58:36,199
<i>I'm so stupid.</i>

1172
01:58:42,948 --> 01:58:45,841
[It was fun being with you.
Thanks. - Woo Jin]

1173
01:58:50,139 --> 01:58:51,532
Woo Jin still likes...

1174
01:59:17,610 --> 01:59:18,810
Hello?

1175
01:59:20,193 --> 01:59:21,393
Hello?

1176
01:59:22,670 --> 01:59:23,787
<i>- You crazy...</i>
- Hello?

1177
01:59:25,154 --> 01:59:27,037
What? Hello?

1178
01:59:28,569 --> 01:59:29,569
<i>It's Jeong Woo Jin!</i>

1179
01:59:30,779 --> 01:59:33,899
<i>Sunghyeon High Class of '92,
Jeong Woo Jin.</i>

1180
01:59:39,832 --> 01:59:41,712
<i>It's Jeong Woo Jin.</i>

1181
01:59:42,771 --> 01:59:44,241
<i>You probably don't remember.</i>

1182
01:59:44,242 --> 01:59:48,399
Jeong Woo... Who?

1183
01:59:49,502 --> 01:59:51,199
Hey, Soo Ah!

1184
01:59:54,826 --> 01:59:56,962
Aren't you thirsty?

1185
02:00:02,293 --> 02:00:03,560
I am.

1186
02:00:05,354 --> 02:00:08,824
<i>Finally, I had my first date with you.</i>

1187
02:00:11,217 --> 02:00:13,158
<i>And I held your hand.</i>

1188
02:00:13,960 --> 02:00:19,275
<i>We were slowly getting close.</i>

1189
02:00:26,597 --> 02:00:28,291
<i>After a long time...</i>

1190
02:00:28,292 --> 02:00:30,990
<i>I got a letter from you.</i>

1191
02:00:31,800 --> 02:00:34,499
<i>[I can't see you anymore. Sorry.]
It was just one sentence.</i>

1192
02:00:34,500 --> 02:00:36,099
From now on...

1193
02:00:36,100 --> 02:00:37,699
let's not see each other.

1194
02:00:43,810 --> 02:00:50,899
<i>We broke up after three dates.</i>

1195
02:00:52,914 --> 02:00:55,100
<i>I missed you so much.</i>

1196
02:00:56,676 --> 02:00:58,148
Soo Ah!

1197
02:00:58,149 --> 02:01:00,639
Want to go make copies
of last year's tests?

1198
02:01:01,297 --> 02:01:02,398
Sure.

1199
02:01:02,399 --> 02:01:05,560
- It's raining so suddenly.
- I know.

1200
02:01:06,654 --> 02:01:10,398
- Did you study a lot?
- Not really.

1201
02:01:10,399 --> 02:01:12,858
I hope the same questions
are on our exam.

1202
02:01:14,118 --> 02:01:15,698
I bombed the last one.

1203
02:01:15,699 --> 02:01:16,796
Wait!

1204
02:01:22,748 --> 02:01:23,868
Woo Jin!

1205
02:01:23,869 --> 02:01:25,311
Jeong Woo Jin!

1206
02:01:37,887 --> 02:01:40,931
<i>You came to see me!</i>

1207
02:01:47,381 --> 02:01:48,381
<i>I'm so sorry!</i>

1208
02:01:55,152 --> 02:02:01,095
<i>I got in an accident
the day you came to see me in Seoul.</i>

1209
02:02:09,279 --> 02:02:10,584
<i>When I woke up...</i>

1210
02:02:10,585 --> 02:02:12,194
<i>Mom!</i>

1211
02:02:12,966 --> 02:02:15,087
- Mom!
- Ji Ho, stop!

1212
02:02:15,088 --> 02:02:16,293
- Mom!
- Let go!

1213
02:02:19,256 --> 02:02:22,233
<i>I had leapt eight years into the future.</i>

1214
02:02:23,930 --> 02:02:28,862
<i>When I got in the accident at age 25</i>

1215
02:02:28,863 --> 02:02:31,799
<i>I lost my memory.</i>

1216
02:02:31,800 --> 02:02:36,140
<i>Then I went 8 years into the future
and met you at age 33.</i>

1217
02:02:36,235 --> 02:02:39,988
<i>And our eight-year-old son, Ji Ho.</i>

1218
02:02:40,719 --> 02:02:46,144
<i>Everything seemed strange
and unfamiliar.</i>

1219
02:02:46,145 --> 02:02:49,127
<i>But I fell in love with you again.</i>

1220
02:02:50,894 --> 02:02:55,223
<i>I had my first kiss with you.</i>

1221
02:02:55,224 --> 02:02:57,139
<i>We loved each other.</i>

1222
02:02:58,212 --> 02:03:01,807
<i>Then we parted again.</i>

1223
02:03:02,715 --> 02:03:04,850
<i>When I woke up again...</i>

1224
02:03:06,400 --> 02:03:08,685
<i>I was back in the hospital.</i>

1225
02:03:10,014 --> 02:03:14,799
<i>They said I woke up miraculously</i>

1226
02:03:14,800 --> 02:03:17,654
<i>after being in a coma for six weeks.</i>

1227
02:03:21,305 --> 02:03:25,389
<i>At first, I thought it was a dream.</i>

1228
02:03:25,390 --> 02:03:27,804
<i>But as time went by,
I remembered more.</i>

1229
02:03:27,805 --> 02:03:33,925
<i>My happy memories with you
felt so unbelievably real.</i>

1230
02:03:38,363 --> 02:03:41,193
<i>I couldn't tell anyone.</i>

1231
02:03:41,194 --> 02:03:45,442
<i>I couldn't even believe it myself.</i>

1232
02:03:45,443 --> 02:03:50,457
<i>Then I thought the future I saw...</i>

1233
02:03:50,483 --> 02:03:54,711
<i>could really come true.</i>

1234
02:03:54,712 --> 02:04:01,412
<i>Marrying you and having
a cute son named Ji Ho</i>

1235
02:04:01,438 --> 02:04:05,800
<i>and living happily together
was a dream come true.</i>

1236
02:04:06,399 --> 02:04:14,171
<i>But I would die at 32
and leave you and Ji Ho behind.</i>

1237
02:04:15,974 --> 02:04:17,639
<i>I was really scared.</i>

1238
02:04:18,926 --> 02:04:22,072
<i>I didn't want to die so soon.</i>

1239
02:04:22,073 --> 02:04:26,880
<i>If I didn't meet you again...</i>

1240
02:04:26,881 --> 02:04:32,224
<i>I'd probably marry someone else
and live on.</i>

1241
02:04:32,225 --> 02:04:37,000
<i>I thought maybe then
I won't have to die at 32.</i>

1242
02:04:38,145 --> 02:04:40,091
<i>But would I be happier?</i>

1243
02:04:41,586 --> 02:04:44,299
<i>Then I realized...</i>

1244
02:04:44,300 --> 02:04:47,884
<i>that I survived that accident...</i>

1245
02:04:47,885 --> 02:04:54,609
<i>because you and Ji Ho waited
desperately for me in the future.</i>

1246
02:05:09,862 --> 02:05:11,499
Hello?

1247
02:05:11,500 --> 02:05:12,899
Woo Jin?

1248
02:05:16,140 --> 02:05:20,300
<i>My beloved Woo Jin and Ji Ho...</i>

1249
02:05:21,505 --> 02:05:26,500
<i>I'm coming to be with you.</i>

1250
02:05:37,631 --> 02:05:39,818
Soo Ah, I...

1251
02:05:39,819 --> 02:05:41,559
Don't worry.

1252
02:05:41,560 --> 02:05:44,100
We'll be fine. It's meant to be.

1253
02:06:17,199 --> 02:06:20,500
<i>[I loved my time with you.
My life was great.]</i>

1254
02:06:33,344 --> 02:06:35,099
Ji Ho! Happy birthday!

1255
02:06:35,100 --> 02:06:37,386
- Hi.
- Jeong Ji Ho!

1256
02:06:38,341 --> 02:06:41,206
Uncle Hong Go's here! Come out!

1257
02:06:41,207 --> 02:06:44,600
He's busy getting ready
for his first date.

1258
02:06:46,027 --> 02:06:47,199
He asked her out?

1259
02:06:48,112 --> 02:06:49,500
Uncle Hong Go!

1260
02:06:50,485 --> 02:06:53,460
You're way more handsome than your dad.

1261
02:06:53,461 --> 02:06:55,059
Thanks, Hong Go.

1262
02:07:01,969 --> 02:07:04,299
<i>[Happy 20th birthday, Ji Ho!
Hope you find true love!]</i>

1263
02:07:04,300 --> 02:07:05,917
<i>[From your mom in Cloudland.]</i>

1264
02:07:15,859 --> 02:07:18,926
<i>Now, I'm done keeping
my promise to your mom.</i>

1265
02:07:23,148 --> 02:07:25,698
Thank you.

1266
02:07:27,528 --> 02:07:29,153
Uncle Hong Go?

1267
02:07:29,154 --> 02:07:32,899
Can you give me a ride into town?

Have fun on your date.
