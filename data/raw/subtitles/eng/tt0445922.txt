1
00:00:56,256 --> 00:01:02,525
Is there anybody
Going to listen to my story

2
00:01:03,061 --> 00:01:07,691
All about the girl who came to stay

3
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,096
She's the kind of girl
You want so much

4
00:01:13,303 --> 00:01:16,136
It makes you sorry

5
00:01:16,506 --> 00:01:21,705
Still you don't regret a single day

6
00:02:40,172 --> 00:02:42,538
Hold me tight

7
00:02:44,142 --> 00:02:46,804
Tell me I'm the only one

8
00:02:47,011 --> 00:02:49,411
And then I might

9
00:02:51,215 --> 00:02:53,775
Never be the lonely one

10
00:02:53,983 --> 00:02:56,417
So hold me tight

11
00:02:57,386 --> 00:02:58,853
Tonight

12
00:02:59,254 --> 00:03:00,744
Tonight

13
00:03:00,988 --> 00:03:03,354
It's you

14
00:04:03,206 --> 00:04:05,504
Who will take me out next week?

15
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:08,268
You'll be halfway around the world.

16
00:04:08,776 --> 00:04:11,210
Well, it better not be Phil Scully.

17
00:04:11,411 --> 00:04:13,003
Come here.

18
00:04:14,481 --> 00:04:16,210
I'll be back soon.

19
00:04:16,717 --> 00:04:19,379
They give you a furlough
after boot camp.

20
00:04:19,985 --> 00:04:21,816
And after that?

21
00:04:45,038 --> 00:04:47,666
- Yeah. All right.
- Good night. I'll see you tomorrow.

22
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:49,274
All right, then.

23
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:03,113
Don't spend it all at once.
Last one for a while, eh, son?

24
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,812
- Last one ever, Cyril.
- I felt the same at your age.

25
00:05:07,022 --> 00:05:11,789
I told myself, "When I'm 64,
I'll be long gone from this place."

26
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,954
- But I'm still here.
- Move it along.

27
00:05:15,162 --> 00:05:18,689
Some of us are thirsty and
the pubs have been open five minutes.

28
00:05:20,534 --> 00:05:21,728
Hi, Charlie.

29
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:26,936
You're gonna miss this place.

30
00:05:27,405 --> 00:05:29,566
Don't count on it, Phil.

31
00:05:50,324 --> 00:05:52,656
I've ironed your best shirts.

32
00:05:53,393 --> 00:05:58,421
I'll be shoveling coal in a furnace,
Mum. I don't think I'll be wearing them.

33
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:01,599
You'll be wearing them
when you go ashore in America.

34
00:06:02,168 --> 00:06:04,500
Yeah, well, that could be
months from now.

35
00:06:04,736 --> 00:06:06,226
If you wanted a seafaring life...

36
00:06:06,436 --> 00:06:08,904
...couldn't you have
signed up for the Mersey Ferry?

37
00:06:09,173 --> 00:06:12,006
At least you'd be home
for your supper every night.

38
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:09,577
I sometimes feel
you're not telling me everything.

39
00:07:10,454 --> 00:07:13,446
I just need a break
from the yard, Molly.

40
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:15,980
I'll be back before you know it.

41
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:19,628
Or do you need a break from me?
Is that what this is about?

42
00:07:19,863 --> 00:07:21,660
Come here.

43
00:07:22,631 --> 00:07:26,158
Close your eyes and I'll kiss ya

44
00:07:27,268 --> 00:07:30,362
Tomorrow I'll miss ya

45
00:07:32,939 --> 00:07:36,534
And remember I'll always be true

46
00:07:36,742 --> 00:07:39,302
- Pull the other one.
- What?

47
00:07:39,644 --> 00:07:42,374
And then while I'm away

48
00:07:43,146 --> 00:07:45,774
I'll write home every day

49
00:07:45,984 --> 00:07:47,713
You better.

50
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:52,480
And I'll send all my loving to you

51
00:07:52,688 --> 00:07:54,781
You bastard.

52
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,341
- Bye, sweetheart!
- Bye!

53
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:28,106
Goodbye, Danny!

54
00:08:56,606 --> 00:08:57,971
Bye.

55
00:08:58,307 --> 00:09:00,468
- Go deep!
- Let's go...

56
00:09:00,709 --> 00:09:02,074
...Wildcats!

57
00:09:03,345 --> 00:09:06,314
All right, ladies, let's take a break.
Come on.

58
00:09:12,017 --> 00:09:17,683
Yeah, I'll tell you somethin'

59
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:23,427
I think you'll understand

60
00:09:24,261 --> 00:09:29,255
When I say that somethin'

61
00:09:30,866 --> 00:09:35,929
I wanna hold your hand

62
00:09:47,447 --> 00:09:53,352
Oh, please say to me

63
00:09:54,485 --> 00:09:58,444
You'll let me be your man

64
00:09:59,723 --> 00:10:04,422
And please say to me

65
00:10:06,328 --> 00:10:11,857
You'll let me hold your hand

66
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:34,180
And when I touch you
I feel happy inside

67
00:10:36,753 --> 00:10:42,191
It's such a feeling that my love

68
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:45,555
I can't hide

69
00:12:06,023 --> 00:12:07,388
Hop in.

70
00:12:08,592 --> 00:12:10,787
Thanks, mate. Appreciate it.

71
00:12:23,871 --> 00:12:25,736
Sorry. Excuse me.

72
00:12:32,611 --> 00:12:35,876
Shit! Goddamn it.

73
00:12:36,781 --> 00:12:38,681
Thanks, man.

74
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:44,677
Excuse me, you don't where I
could find Professor Huber, do you?

75
00:12:44,888 --> 00:12:47,550
No such person.
Not that I'm aware of.

76
00:12:47,756 --> 00:12:50,452
Professor Wesley Huber?

77
00:12:50,658 --> 00:12:53,183
Listen, I've pissed off
every professor in Princeton...

78
00:12:53,394 --> 00:12:55,123
...and he's not one of them.

79
00:12:55,329 --> 00:12:57,991
Oh, wait a second,
there's a Wes Huber.

80
00:12:58,198 --> 00:12:59,631
That's him right over there.

81
00:13:08,573 --> 00:13:10,040
Can I have a word?

82
00:13:10,241 --> 00:13:13,210
If you're looking for work here,
check with administration.

83
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:15,469
I got a job, thanks.

84
00:13:16,046 --> 00:13:17,513
You sound like a limey.

85
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:20,037
I am, yeah.

86
00:13:21,917 --> 00:13:26,445
I was stationed there during the war.
I had some good times.

87
00:13:27,055 --> 00:13:28,647
Yeah, I know.

88
00:13:29,757 --> 00:13:31,918
At Burtonwood, right?

89
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,057
How would you know that?

90
00:13:37,463 --> 00:13:39,363
L... I believe I'm your son.

91
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,363
I don't think so.

92
00:13:45,403 --> 00:13:47,462
Me mother's Martha Feeny.

93
00:13:53,042 --> 00:13:55,135
How'd you track me down?

94
00:13:55,978 --> 00:13:58,003
Through Army records.

95
00:13:58,914 --> 00:14:00,404
If I would have known about you...

96
00:14:00,615 --> 00:14:03,140
What? You would've come back,
is that it?

97
00:14:04,018 --> 00:14:07,112
You know, she said that wouldn't
have proved that you loved her...

98
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,810
...only that you felt obligated.

99
00:14:10,957 --> 00:14:14,324
Well, it would have been better
than raising a kid on her own.

100
00:14:14,526 --> 00:14:17,188
Yeah, well, she wasn't the only one
in those days.

101
00:14:17,395 --> 00:14:21,161
You could excuse a bastard by saying
his dad was killed in the war.

102
00:14:31,239 --> 00:14:32,706
Did she find someone else?

103
00:14:35,309 --> 00:14:38,710
There were a few hopefuls
over the years, yeah.

104
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:40,344
I think I scared them off.

105
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:44,676
- Listen, kid, l...
- It's Jude.

106
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,283
Jude.

107
00:14:46,918 --> 00:14:49,614
I got a family.
I got a wife, I got two kids.

108
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:54,450
Yeah, look. Mr. Huber,
I didn't come here to derail your life.

109
00:14:55,559 --> 00:14:58,357
You know? And I'm not here
for your love or your approval.

110
00:14:58,561 --> 00:15:02,053
I'm just here so that we both...

111
00:15:02,264 --> 00:15:05,563
Both know
that the other one exists.

112
00:15:10,738 --> 00:15:12,330
All right.

113
00:15:13,607 --> 00:15:17,441
- Fifteen bucks says you miss this shot.
- Fifty says your sister still marries me.

114
00:15:17,643 --> 00:15:19,270
Yeah, well, maybe.

115
00:15:19,477 --> 00:15:21,001
All right, window. Let's go.

116
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:22,702
- All right, ladies.
- There you go.

117
00:15:22,913 --> 00:15:24,210
- Ready?
- Yep.

118
00:15:24,515 --> 00:15:26,039
Okay.

119
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,376
Fore!

120
00:15:27,818 --> 00:15:29,581
Run!

121
00:15:29,952 --> 00:15:31,283
You missed!

122
00:15:31,487 --> 00:15:32,715
- Whatever.
- It was the wind.

123
00:15:32,922 --> 00:15:34,480
- Set me up.
- I believe in you.

124
00:15:34,689 --> 00:15:37,487
You couldn't hit the barn side
of a broad, man. Come on.

125
00:15:37,691 --> 00:15:39,090
There you go.

126
00:15:39,294 --> 00:15:40,784
Fore!

127
00:15:42,863 --> 00:15:46,128
Oh, yes! Yes! Yes!

128
00:15:46,332 --> 00:15:48,994
- How do you like me now?
- We're gonna get you, asshole!

129
00:15:49,201 --> 00:15:52,432
How do you like me? Go to bed.
Go to bed, you ain't got nothing.

130
00:15:52,637 --> 00:15:55,538
- Yeah, they're going back into...
- They're not going back to bed.

131
00:15:55,741 --> 00:15:57,436
- No, they're not.
- Go, go, go.

132
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:08,140
Go, go, go.

133
00:16:09,652 --> 00:16:11,643
They went this way. Come on!

134
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:26,423
Shit, I'm out of shape.

135
00:16:31,835 --> 00:16:34,463
You're the guy who was
asking for the janitor, right?

136
00:16:34,671 --> 00:16:35,660
Yeah.

137
00:16:35,872 --> 00:16:38,500
So, what are you,
like the assistant janitor?

138
00:16:40,076 --> 00:16:43,842
I'm just bunking down here,
you know, temporarily.

139
00:16:44,046 --> 00:16:46,037
- Why?
- Why do you need to know?

140
00:16:47,415 --> 00:16:50,213
You're wanted by the cops, huh?
FBI?

141
00:16:51,251 --> 00:16:55,153
You know, it looks to me as though
you're the one who's on the run.

142
00:16:55,354 --> 00:16:58,221
Yeah.
Thank you for that, by the way.

143
00:16:58,424 --> 00:17:00,449
What would they have done
if they caught you?

144
00:17:00,658 --> 00:17:05,618
I don't know. Something involving
genitalia and shoe polish.

145
00:17:06,362 --> 00:17:08,796
- Nasty.
- Yeah.

146
00:17:08,999 --> 00:17:12,560
- Where's that accent from?
- Same place as me. Liverpool.

147
00:17:13,768 --> 00:17:14,996
And do you have a name?

148
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:17,201
Yeah.

149
00:17:18,172 --> 00:17:19,901
- It's Jude.
- Max.

150
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,031
I'm pleased to meet you.

151
00:17:23,243 --> 00:17:26,110
Well, Jude,
as a stranger to our shores...

152
00:17:26,312 --> 00:17:31,272
...the least I can do is offer you
some Ivy League hospitality.

153
00:17:36,486 --> 00:17:37,817
Cheers.

154
00:17:41,091 --> 00:17:43,321
Welcome to the nursery.

155
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:47,090
What would you do
If I sang out of tune

156
00:17:47,295 --> 00:17:48,728
- Thank you.
- Would you stand up

157
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:51,023
And walk out on me?

158
00:17:52,065 --> 00:17:53,623
- Hey. I'm Chris.
- Lend me your ears

159
00:17:53,835 --> 00:17:55,769
- And I'll sing you a song
- Thanks.

160
00:17:55,969 --> 00:17:59,063
- And I'll try not to sing out of key
- There we go. All right.

161
00:17:59,905 --> 00:18:03,238
I get by
With a little help from my friends

162
00:18:04,109 --> 00:18:07,272
He gets high
With a little help from his friends

163
00:18:11,415 --> 00:18:12,905
- Take it easy, man.
- Hold it in.

164
00:20:41,068 --> 00:20:43,559
I can't believe her.

165
00:20:46,338 --> 00:20:48,272
I'm never having children.

166
00:20:48,473 --> 00:20:51,670
- Really?
- No.

167
00:20:51,877 --> 00:20:54,368
Think about it, it's pure narcissism.

168
00:20:54,578 --> 00:20:57,775
I mean, people putting out little
carbon copies of themselves, going:

169
00:20:57,981 --> 00:20:59,881
"Oh, doesn't he have
his father's eyes?

170
00:21:00,082 --> 00:21:02,016
Doesn't he have his mother's lips?"
It's...

171
00:21:02,217 --> 00:21:04,117
It's disgusting.

172
00:21:04,986 --> 00:21:07,887
Well, what about adoption?

173
00:21:08,489 --> 00:21:09,751
Luce!

174
00:21:10,124 --> 00:21:12,251
Lucy!

175
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:36,911
Every night
When everybody has fun

176
00:21:37,913 --> 00:21:42,179
Here am I
Sitting all on my own

177
00:21:43,951 --> 00:21:45,316
It won't be long, yeah

178
00:21:53,158 --> 00:21:56,184
Till I belong to you

179
00:21:58,095 --> 00:22:01,462
Since you left me, I'm so alone

180
00:22:01,665 --> 00:22:05,294
Now you're coming
You're coming on home

181
00:22:05,735 --> 00:22:08,431
I'll be good like I know I should

182
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:18,707
- Do you know when?
- Next weekend.

183
00:22:18,911 --> 00:22:21,744
He got a pass
before his outfit ships out.

184
00:23:34,473 --> 00:23:37,636
I tell you, man,
this is my favorite time of day.

185
00:23:37,842 --> 00:23:38,509
- Look at these. That one, she's cute.
- Emily!

186
00:23:38,509 --> 00:23:41,307
- Look at these. That one, she's cute.
- Emily!

187
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:44,842
- Hey.
- Max!

188
00:23:45,047 --> 00:23:46,605
Jailbait.

189
00:23:51,686 --> 00:23:53,176
- How are you? Good.
- I'm good.

190
00:23:53,388 --> 00:23:55,356
- Damn.
- Max, you're such a pervert.

191
00:23:55,555 --> 00:23:57,921
What? Some of them
are kind of cute.

192
00:23:58,324 --> 00:23:59,621
When did Emily get tits?

193
00:24:01,227 --> 00:24:02,785
Emily.

194
00:24:03,863 --> 00:24:07,321
This is Jude. I asked him over
for Thanksgiving.

195
00:24:13,269 --> 00:24:16,102
We don't have it in England.
Is it...? Is it a big deal?

196
00:24:16,305 --> 00:24:18,967
Well, it's a heartwarming
American tradition.

197
00:24:19,175 --> 00:24:21,166
Yeah. It celebrates the time...

198
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:24,209
...when the Indians shared their food
with the early settlers.

199
00:24:24,412 --> 00:24:27,142
And how did we repay them?
We slaughter them in thousands...

200
00:24:27,348 --> 00:24:30,340
...and then ship them off
to the shittiest bits of real estate.

201
00:24:30,717 --> 00:24:32,116
I'm Lucy.

202
00:24:35,021 --> 00:24:38,218
I went to the closet under the stairs
and my clubs weren't there.

203
00:24:38,424 --> 00:24:40,255
- If you'd asked...
- You'd have said no.

204
00:24:40,458 --> 00:24:42,323
I never knew Princeton
had a golf program.

205
00:24:42,527 --> 00:24:43,516
They don't.

206
00:24:43,927 --> 00:24:46,293
It's just my way of unwinding,
you know?

207
00:24:46,495 --> 00:24:48,588
Whack a few balls around
at the end of the day.

208
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:50,426
Those lectures can fry your brains.

209
00:24:50,633 --> 00:24:53,568
"Lectures." What lectures?
He dropped two courses.

210
00:24:53,768 --> 00:24:54,996
Is that fashionable?

211
00:24:56,204 --> 00:24:57,330
Is what fashionable?

212
00:24:57,705 --> 00:25:01,402
- Your haircut, or lack of one.
- Androgyny suits you, Max.

213
00:25:01,841 --> 00:25:04,241
These kids are so spoiled.

214
00:25:04,445 --> 00:25:07,539
I washed dishes
to put myself through college.

215
00:25:07,747 --> 00:25:11,706
You've never washed one since.
More stuffing, Jude?

216
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:13,547
I'm stuffed enough, thanks.

217
00:25:13,751 --> 00:25:16,686
You have any idea what your father
pays for those tuition fees?

218
00:25:16,886 --> 00:25:19,013
- Please.
- You know, Uncle Teddy...

219
00:25:19,223 --> 00:25:21,453
...he won't have to
pay them much longer.

220
00:25:21,658 --> 00:25:24,456
- I'm dropping out.
- The cranberry sauce isn't as tangy...

221
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:26,651
- Don't be ridiculous.
- I am not cut out...

222
00:25:26,862 --> 00:25:28,352
...for this collegiate crap.

223
00:25:28,563 --> 00:25:30,622
No problem. What are you...?
What's your plans?

224
00:25:30,831 --> 00:25:33,356
You gonna buy a broken-down
station wagon...

225
00:25:33,568 --> 00:25:35,695
...and drive across America
like Jack...

226
00:25:35,902 --> 00:25:37,164
- What is it?
- Kerouac.

227
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:38,860
- Mom.
- I read.

228
00:25:39,071 --> 00:25:43,440
Well, actually, I was hoping to borrow
your car, Dad. It's got AC and stereo.

229
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:45,938
Goddamn it, Max!

230
00:25:46,143 --> 00:25:48,134
Be serious for once.

231
00:25:48,346 --> 00:25:50,837
What do you actually intend
to do with your life?

232
00:25:51,048 --> 00:25:53,573
Why is it always about,
"What will you do?"

233
00:25:53,783 --> 00:25:56,775
"What will you do? What will he do?
Oh, my God, what will he do?"

234
00:25:56,985 --> 00:25:58,452
Do, do, do, do, do.

235
00:25:58,653 --> 00:26:00,484
Why isn't the issue here who I am?

236
00:26:00,855 --> 00:26:03,915
Because, Maxwell,
what you do defines who you are.

237
00:26:04,126 --> 00:26:08,222
No, Uncle Teddy,
who you are defines what you do.

238
00:26:08,428 --> 00:26:09,520
Right, Jude?

239
00:26:13,932 --> 00:26:16,696
Surely it's not what you do...

240
00:26:16,901 --> 00:26:20,098
...but it's the way that you do it.

241
00:26:24,474 --> 00:26:27,204
Sorry you had to sit through that.

242
00:26:28,244 --> 00:26:30,508
Is it like that at your house?

243
00:26:30,712 --> 00:26:32,543
Not really, no.

244
00:26:32,748 --> 00:26:34,773
It's just me and me mum...

245
00:26:34,983 --> 00:26:38,419
...so me education
is rarely a topic of conversation.

246
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:42,384
Max said you came here
to find your father.

247
00:26:43,022 --> 00:26:46,753
- You jumped ship.
- Yeah, I did. Yeah.

248
00:26:46,959 --> 00:26:51,259
It was weird when I got
this Princeton address, you know.

249
00:26:51,463 --> 00:26:54,796
I had it in my head that he might be
some kind of Einstein or something.

250
00:26:54,999 --> 00:26:58,560
But it turns out he's just
a working stiff like meself.

251
00:26:58,968 --> 00:27:00,265
How'd it go?

252
00:27:01,403 --> 00:27:03,234
It was okay.

253
00:27:03,639 --> 00:27:06,437
I mean, he didn't invite me back
for Thanksgiving.

254
00:27:08,109 --> 00:27:12,102
Might've been a bit tricky anyway. I've
spent half me life trying to hate him.

255
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:18,278
He walked out on me mum
when I was just a bun in the oven.

256
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,914
I never realized I had it so easy.

257
00:27:26,557 --> 00:27:28,991
I mean, we're so... normal.

258
00:27:29,193 --> 00:27:30,660
Oh, yeah?

259
00:27:31,395 --> 00:27:33,329
I don't know, dinner was quite lively.

260
00:27:33,529 --> 00:27:37,158
You know, when do that lot start
chucking plates at each other?

261
00:27:37,465 --> 00:27:40,161
- Dessert. Yeah.
- Oh, dessert. All right, yeah.

262
00:27:42,036 --> 00:27:44,129
My God, you...
You have perfect teeth.

263
00:27:45,071 --> 00:27:47,232
No, you do, they're perfect.

264
00:27:47,441 --> 00:27:49,306
People in Liverpool,
they only seldom do.

265
00:27:49,509 --> 00:27:53,707
They stick out in all different
directions. It's horrible.

266
00:27:53,912 --> 00:27:55,072
You never heard of braces?

267
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:58,738
Yes, I have, thank you very much.
We use them to keep our trousers up.

268
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:01,544
Goddamn it! It's like this
every time I come home.

269
00:28:01,752 --> 00:28:04,448
I mean, what the hell do they
talk about when I'm not here?

270
00:28:04,654 --> 00:28:06,485
You, mainly.

271
00:28:06,689 --> 00:28:09,658
Jude, shit. I'm sorry, man.

272
00:28:09,859 --> 00:28:11,656
Come on, we gotta
do something with him.

273
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:15,193
He's a sailor on leave. He needs
a bar, a brawl and a brothel.

274
00:28:21,201 --> 00:28:22,190
I've just seen a face

275
00:28:22,401 --> 00:28:24,835
I can't forget
The time or place where we just met

276
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:26,197
She's just the girl for me

277
00:28:26,404 --> 00:28:29,237
And I want all the world to see
We've met

278
00:28:47,622 --> 00:28:49,613
No.

279
00:28:53,059 --> 00:28:54,492
Why, thank you.

280
00:29:06,303 --> 00:29:08,203
Oh, yes!

281
00:29:08,572 --> 00:29:10,802
What will you do
if you don't go back to college?

282
00:29:11,007 --> 00:29:13,999
What any irresponsible, unmotivated
dropout would do:

283
00:29:14,209 --> 00:29:16,074
Go to New York. Like, tonight.

284
00:29:16,646 --> 00:29:18,375
What's the rush?

285
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:20,579
I mean, I like it here.

286
00:29:20,782 --> 00:29:23,444
Come on. The most exciting thing
that ever happened here...

287
00:29:23,651 --> 00:29:26,745
...was when they got automatic
pin setting. I'm talking the Village.

288
00:29:26,953 --> 00:29:29,444
Think about it.
Great music, great dope, orgies.

289
00:29:29,788 --> 00:29:32,052
It'll be a gas!

290
00:29:43,565 --> 00:29:45,226
Yeah!

291
00:30:06,117 --> 00:30:07,709
She's got a boyfriend.

292
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:10,444
That's okay. I've got a girlfriend.

293
00:30:37,276 --> 00:30:39,107
Forget it, man.

294
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:41,375
I'm not living here.

295
00:30:44,382 --> 00:30:45,974
You must be the two who called.

296
00:30:46,183 --> 00:30:49,311
Yeah. We saw your ad
in Rat Magazine.

297
00:30:50,186 --> 00:30:52,552
Right. Come on in.

298
00:30:54,689 --> 00:30:56,850
It's our kitchen through here.

299
00:30:58,158 --> 00:31:01,525
This would be our main room...

300
00:31:01,729 --> 00:31:04,960
...living room, whatever room.

301
00:31:06,032 --> 00:31:07,897
Real bummer losing my last tenant.

302
00:31:08,101 --> 00:31:12,629
He played sax at the Gaslight.
Out all night, slept all day.

303
00:31:13,804 --> 00:31:14,964
We could do that.

304
00:31:15,173 --> 00:31:17,573
You'd have to, man,
because I'm a singer.

305
00:31:17,775 --> 00:31:20,972
I can't have no one screwing up
my beauty sleep before 2:00.

306
00:31:21,845 --> 00:31:24,040
Someone can take this bedroom.

307
00:31:24,246 --> 00:31:27,181
I'm gonna need two weeks in advance,
guys. Is that a problem?

308
00:31:27,382 --> 00:31:31,148
- No, no, no, that's not a problem at all.
- You look kind of clean-cut.

309
00:31:31,352 --> 00:31:34,480
Then again, could've murdered
your granny with a hammer.

310
00:31:39,392 --> 00:31:42,850
Actually, we're students.

311
00:31:43,061 --> 00:31:44,756
I'm Jude and he's Max.

312
00:31:44,964 --> 00:31:46,226
I'm Sadie.

313
00:31:46,431 --> 00:31:48,729
That's me. Out of bounds.

314
00:31:49,666 --> 00:31:52,191
- Are you famous, Sadie?
- Man.

315
00:31:52,403 --> 00:31:53,961
Not yet.

316
00:31:54,437 --> 00:31:56,132
You guys have
a good memory for faces?

317
00:31:56,339 --> 00:31:58,398
Yeah, I think so. Why?

318
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:00,608
There's no mirror in your bathroom.

319
00:32:11,151 --> 00:32:13,381
- Oh, man! What a fox!
- Yes!

320
00:32:13,586 --> 00:32:16,419
I mean, for an older woman, huh?

321
00:32:17,689 --> 00:32:21,819
Max, I will pay for my share of the rent
just as soon as I get a job, man.

322
00:32:22,793 --> 00:32:26,889
Jude, don't worry about it.
Look where we are, man.

323
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,992
Move it, pal. Come on.

324
00:32:33,436 --> 00:32:35,495
Get out of here.

325
00:33:22,841 --> 00:33:25,571
Get on the ground!
Get down!

326
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,326
Attention.

327
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:46,025
The 7:05 Northeast Limited
leaving for New York City...

328
00:36:46,236 --> 00:36:49,535
...now ready for boarding
on Platform 20.

329
00:36:49,739 --> 00:36:54,904
Platform 20, Northeast Limited
now ready for boarding.

330
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:27,525
Check it out, man.

331
00:39:28,299 --> 00:39:29,288
Check it out.

332
00:39:31,168 --> 00:39:32,465
Rat.

333
00:39:36,738 --> 00:39:38,501
What the hell are you doing, man?

334
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,168
Desmond, this boy
wants to talk to you.

335
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:14,666
Hey.

336
00:40:19,239 --> 00:40:20,433
I love it.

337
00:40:58,337 --> 00:41:00,271
"Just stand on your head."
She said, "Why?"

338
00:41:00,473 --> 00:41:02,873
"I wanna see what it'd look like
through a beer."

339
00:41:03,074 --> 00:41:05,474
- Get off me.
- Oh, man.

340
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:10,645
Hey, do you write your own songs,
Jo-Jo?

341
00:41:10,848 --> 00:41:12,076
Yeah.

342
00:41:12,416 --> 00:41:13,781
I got 20 in a notebook...

343
00:41:14,217 --> 00:41:15,844
...another 10 in my head.

344
00:41:16,052 --> 00:41:17,610
Leave room for anything else?

345
00:41:17,986 --> 00:41:21,183
Music's the only thing
that makes sense anymore, man.

346
00:41:21,856 --> 00:41:26,122
Play it loud enough,
it keeps the demons at bay.

347
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:36,061
Hello, hello. Who are you?

348
00:41:37,603 --> 00:41:41,061
- Prudence.
- Where you from, Prudence?

349
00:41:41,706 --> 00:41:43,333
Nowhere.

350
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:46,670
Oh, and before nowhere?

351
00:41:48,944 --> 00:41:50,605
Ohio.

352
00:41:50,812 --> 00:41:54,612
Then I was living
with this guy across the street.

353
00:41:57,452 --> 00:41:58,817
Did he do that to you?

354
00:41:59,319 --> 00:42:01,219
He was a mistake.

355
00:42:03,289 --> 00:42:04,813
Where'd she come from?

356
00:42:06,291 --> 00:42:08,589
She came in
through the bathroom window.

357
00:42:10,228 --> 00:42:11,923
Thanks.

358
00:42:12,997 --> 00:42:14,988
I understand you need to get away...

359
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:17,667
...but why not come to Europe
with your father and me?

360
00:42:17,867 --> 00:42:19,858
I'd rather be with Max.

361
00:42:20,068 --> 00:42:21,763
In New York?

362
00:42:21,971 --> 00:42:24,769
Just for the summer,
till I go to college.

363
00:42:25,541 --> 00:42:29,307
I shudder to think how Max lives,
or what he's up to.

364
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:31,978
He always attracts
the most dubious people.

365
00:42:32,178 --> 00:42:35,579
He's probably surrounded by
promiscuous dope fiends.

366
00:42:35,781 --> 00:42:37,442
Mom!

367
00:42:37,984 --> 00:42:40,851
You know me. I don't even smoke.

368
00:42:42,387 --> 00:42:44,855
The big, bad city's
not gonna get me.

369
00:43:15,147 --> 00:43:16,739
Isn't she fantastic?

370
00:43:20,183 --> 00:43:21,878
Amazing.

371
00:43:22,353 --> 00:43:24,321
She's our landlady.

372
00:43:24,588 --> 00:43:28,115
- You live with my brother too?
- Yeah, him and Jude took me in.

373
00:43:28,324 --> 00:43:30,588
I don't sleep with them anymore.

374
00:43:58,548 --> 00:44:00,106
Thank you.

375
00:44:00,515 --> 00:44:02,449
Hey, Lucy?

376
00:44:02,651 --> 00:44:05,017
How do you like New York so far?

377
00:44:05,219 --> 00:44:08,154
This is all I've seen. I only
got off the train three hours ago.

378
00:44:08,356 --> 00:44:10,722
- Oh, yeah?
- Let's hear it for the Po Boys, y'all.

379
00:44:10,925 --> 00:44:13,018
Do you wanna go out
and get some fresh air?

380
00:44:15,294 --> 00:44:17,592
- Yeah?
- How about another one?

381
00:44:17,796 --> 00:44:19,764
- All right, bring it home!
- All right!

382
00:44:20,633 --> 00:44:22,760
Man, it's packed in there.

383
00:44:23,434 --> 00:44:27,029
Your girlfriend didn't look too happy
about us leaving together.

384
00:44:27,738 --> 00:44:30,298
She... She's not my girlfriend.

385
00:44:30,506 --> 00:44:34,966
Well, you know, she's a friend
who's a girl.

386
00:44:37,912 --> 00:44:39,880
I thought you'd gone home.

387
00:44:40,081 --> 00:44:42,948
No, no. I like it here.

388
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:44,549
Although I'm not really here.

389
00:44:44,751 --> 00:44:48,312
You know, without a visa
I don't officially exist.

390
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:52,786
It's exhilarating in a way. It's like
a weird kind of freedom. You know?

391
00:44:56,394 --> 00:44:57,759
Hey.

392
00:44:58,796 --> 00:45:00,593
Are you okay?

393
00:45:01,965 --> 00:45:05,025
I mean, you know,
I heard what happened.

394
00:45:06,336 --> 00:45:07,667
Yeah.

395
00:45:11,272 --> 00:45:12,830
But...

396
00:45:14,374 --> 00:45:17,673
...a letter came for Max
before I left home...

397
00:45:19,145 --> 00:45:22,546
...and I haven't been able
to bring myself to give it to him yet.

398
00:45:25,784 --> 00:45:28,912
- Scrub the floor, right, Jo-Jo?
- That's disgusting.

399
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:32,919
That was great, man.
You got a really good sound.

400
00:45:34,958 --> 00:45:37,051
You shouldn't have
dropped out of college, Max.

401
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:40,661
Your sister's right. You had that
whole Ivy League thing going for you.

402
00:45:40,862 --> 00:45:44,093
- And your father's a lawyer and shit.
- Max, what exactly does it say?

403
00:45:45,533 --> 00:45:48,195
It says I have to report to
an induction center on the 7th.

404
00:45:48,401 --> 00:45:49,368
Bummer.

405
00:45:49,570 --> 00:45:51,663
You got a week to contract
some fatal disease.

406
00:45:51,871 --> 00:45:54,203
Guys tried all kinds of stuff
when I did my time.

407
00:45:54,407 --> 00:45:57,865
- You were in the military, Jo-Jo?
- No escaping it where I'm from.

408
00:45:58,077 --> 00:45:59,339
I went in when I was 17.

409
00:45:59,544 --> 00:46:01,512
Say you're a homo.
They don't take homos.

410
00:46:01,713 --> 00:46:04,739
Just say you're a pedophile.
Say you wanna go into the villages...

411
00:46:04,949 --> 00:46:08,851
...and you wanna rape and pillage
all the little girls that look like me.

412
00:46:09,052 --> 00:46:10,519
I remember this one cat.

413
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:13,120
He ate a ton of beets
the night before the physical.

414
00:46:13,322 --> 00:46:15,847
- Looks like blood when you piss.
- Well, I hate beets.

415
00:46:16,057 --> 00:46:18,184
- Can we get the check, please?
- In a minute.

416
00:46:18,392 --> 00:46:20,121
- What is with these pricks?
- Calm down.

417
00:46:20,328 --> 00:46:23,559
My mate's brother swallowed
a ball of cotton to get out the army.

418
00:46:23,764 --> 00:46:24,992
What does that do?

419
00:46:25,198 --> 00:46:27,723
It shows up as, like,
a shadow on the x-ray.

420
00:46:27,934 --> 00:46:31,199
- Track marks. They won't take a junkie.
- You want him to shoot up?

421
00:46:31,403 --> 00:46:34,099
No. We could just jab his arm
with a needle a few times.

422
00:46:34,306 --> 00:46:36,467
Make it a rusty needle.
Then it'll get infected.

423
00:46:36,674 --> 00:46:38,733
- That could work.
- Yeah. Gets all nasty.

424
00:46:38,943 --> 00:46:41,741
- Max.
- Oh, man, Max, what are you doing?

425
00:46:43,412 --> 00:46:45,209
You can burn that paper, boy...

426
00:46:45,848 --> 00:46:47,873
...but you still gotta show.

427
00:46:51,853 --> 00:46:54,219
Daniel couldn't wait to go.

428
00:46:54,788 --> 00:46:58,383
He saw it as his patriotic duty.

429
00:46:58,624 --> 00:47:00,148
And I went along with it.

430
00:47:00,826 --> 00:47:02,293
I was proud of him, I guess.

431
00:47:05,297 --> 00:47:08,266
Apparently, he did
something brave...

432
00:47:08,466 --> 00:47:12,266
...so he wore a medal
when they buried him.

433
00:47:12,603 --> 00:47:14,867
You don't have to talk about this.

434
00:47:16,972 --> 00:47:18,166
I want to.

435
00:47:21,676 --> 00:47:23,576
I can't pretend like it didn't happen.

436
00:47:24,678 --> 00:47:27,340
He was my first boyfriend.

437
00:47:27,548 --> 00:47:30,483
He was the first person
I ever knew to die.

438
00:47:30,784 --> 00:47:34,049
I'd never even been
to a funeral before.

439
00:47:40,725 --> 00:47:42,386
I'm so scared for Max.

440
00:47:42,592 --> 00:47:45,686
Listen, no one and no gun
is gonna get Max.

441
00:47:47,163 --> 00:47:51,327
You know, he's so twisted,
he'll bend his way out of this fix.

442
00:47:52,735 --> 00:47:54,532
Hope you're right.

443
00:47:55,003 --> 00:47:56,630
I am right.

444
00:47:58,405 --> 00:47:59,770
I love the bugger.

445
00:48:19,523 --> 00:48:23,721
- Do you have the draft in England?
- Not anymore.

446
00:48:23,926 --> 00:48:26,224
Well, I'd have been exempt
as a shipyard worker.

447
00:48:28,496 --> 00:48:29,827
You should've studied art.

448
00:48:31,331 --> 00:48:32,662
Yeah.

449
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,628
Well, I had to bring money
into the house.

450
00:48:35,836 --> 00:48:39,135
So I joined the ranks
of the great unwashed.

451
00:48:42,774 --> 00:48:44,207
Here. Come here.

452
00:48:44,576 --> 00:48:45,565
Come here.

453
00:48:49,314 --> 00:48:51,111
A little closer.

454
00:48:54,684 --> 00:48:56,743
I just wanna get your eyes right.

455
00:49:00,322 --> 00:49:03,257
You two, scram!
You're defacing city property.

456
00:49:03,458 --> 00:49:05,756
- Oh, shit.
- What are you talking about?

457
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:08,485
This was just a crappy wall
and now it's a work of art.

458
00:49:08,695 --> 00:49:10,128
You want me to come down there?

459
00:49:10,330 --> 00:49:14,061
Please do come down.
You'll scuff up them shiny black boots.

460
00:49:14,266 --> 00:49:15,460
Idiot.

461
00:49:15,666 --> 00:49:18,430
Shit! Come on, you don't want to
get in trouble with the law.

462
00:49:18,637 --> 00:49:20,969
- Let's go!
- Go! Go, go, go.

463
00:49:24,174 --> 00:49:26,108
Jude, Jude, come here. Come here.

464
00:49:54,131 --> 00:49:57,430
If I fell in love with you

465
00:49:58,768 --> 00:50:02,101
Would you promise to be true

466
00:50:03,539 --> 00:50:10,672
And help me understand

467
00:50:11,978 --> 00:50:16,074
'Cause I've been in love before

468
00:50:16,448 --> 00:50:20,111
And I found that love was more

469
00:50:21,086 --> 00:50:26,956
Than just holding hands

470
00:50:27,157 --> 00:50:35,963
If I give my heart to you

471
00:50:36,465 --> 00:50:44,270
I must be sure from the very start

472
00:50:45,204 --> 00:50:53,441
That you would love me
More than her

473
00:50:57,214 --> 00:51:02,379
If I trust in you

474
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:09,058
Oh, please, don't run and hide

475
00:51:09,258 --> 00:51:14,321
If I love you too

476
00:51:15,162 --> 00:51:23,467
Oh, please, don't hurt my pride
Like her

477
00:51:24,303 --> 00:51:29,764
'Cause I couldn't stand the pain

478
00:51:30,174 --> 00:51:41,813
And I would be sad if our new love
Was in vain

479
00:52:32,424 --> 00:52:33,652
So that's the way it is.

480
00:52:38,129 --> 00:52:40,529
Yeah. That's the way it is.

481
00:52:40,730 --> 00:52:44,564
Yeah, well, speaking as a brother,
I think she could do better.

482
00:52:45,435 --> 00:52:46,697
Max, get out.

483
00:52:46,902 --> 00:52:50,998
Well, excuse me, but as blissful as
you are in the throes of young love...

484
00:52:51,205 --> 00:52:54,265
...l'm just letting you know
I got a date with Uncle Sam.

485
00:53:25,833 --> 00:53:27,698
I want you

486
00:53:29,603 --> 00:53:33,266
I want you so bad

487
00:53:38,377 --> 00:53:41,073
I want you so bad

488
00:53:41,279 --> 00:53:43,247
It's drivin' me mad

489
00:55:52,316 --> 00:55:54,716
Any reason you shouldn't
be in this man's Army, son?

490
00:55:54,919 --> 00:55:58,218
I'm a cross-dressing homosexual
pacifist with a spot on my lung.

491
00:55:58,522 --> 00:56:00,217
Long as you don't have flat feet.

492
00:56:05,427 --> 00:56:09,090
You know what really pisses me off?
Is I swallowed all those cotton balls...

493
00:56:09,297 --> 00:56:10,924
...and they never even
took an x-ray.

494
00:56:11,131 --> 00:56:13,622
- You still have options, man.
- Yeah, jail or Canada...

495
00:56:13,834 --> 00:56:15,165
...and they both suck.

496
00:56:15,368 --> 00:56:17,666
I mean, I could never come home.
So, what is it?

497
00:56:17,871 --> 00:56:22,308
It's a choice of a 6-by-4 cell or an
endless wasteland of frozen tundra.

498
00:56:22,507 --> 00:56:25,476
- Montreal's cool.
- Man, they speak French.

499
00:56:25,709 --> 00:56:27,904
So learn French.
Learn French or die.

500
00:56:57,636 --> 00:56:59,433
You think Sadie knows?

501
00:57:01,172 --> 00:57:02,799
Knows what?

502
00:57:21,587 --> 00:57:23,020
Let me see.

503
00:57:25,457 --> 00:57:28,893
- No way.
- You look gorgeous.

504
00:57:29,094 --> 00:57:31,119
Sadie, come on. What...?

505
00:57:31,329 --> 00:57:34,958
- It's my band, honey.
- I can't wear this.

506
00:57:36,499 --> 00:57:39,900
It's Tuxedo Club. For my 'do.

507
00:57:41,804 --> 00:57:43,328
Yeah?

508
00:57:50,845 --> 00:57:53,313
- Cool.
- Don't start.

509
00:57:53,513 --> 00:57:55,447
What is it, Max?

510
00:57:56,750 --> 00:57:59,583
Prudence. Come on, sweet pea.

511
00:57:59,952 --> 00:58:01,112
We all love you.

512
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:03,652
- How long's she been in there?
- All night, I guess.

513
00:58:04,989 --> 00:58:07,253
- Come on, Pru.
- What's going on?

514
00:58:07,457 --> 00:58:09,982
It's Prudence.
I think she's hung up on me.

515
00:58:13,596 --> 00:58:15,894
Dear Prudence

516
00:58:16,098 --> 00:58:18,362
Won't you come out to play?

517
00:58:20,335 --> 00:58:22,667
Dear Prudence

518
00:58:22,870 --> 00:58:28,467
Greet the brand-new day

519
00:58:30,810 --> 00:58:33,677
The sun is up, the sky is blue

520
00:58:33,879 --> 00:58:37,280
It's beautiful and so are you

521
00:58:46,689 --> 00:58:49,886
- Sadie, we gotta go.
- Later.

522
01:00:02,383 --> 01:00:06,717
Hey, hey, LBJ.
How many kids did you kill today?

523
01:00:12,824 --> 01:00:17,727
Our voice is our weapon.
And united we will win!

524
01:00:19,263 --> 01:00:20,594
That's right, yeah!

525
01:00:20,797 --> 01:00:26,667
You can crush the idealists,
but you cannot crush their ideals!

526
01:00:29,571 --> 01:00:34,133
The Americans are forcing even their
friends into becoming their enemies.

527
01:00:34,841 --> 01:00:37,708
Every day the hatred increases...

528
01:00:37,910 --> 01:00:40,902
...in the hearts of the Vietnamese
who want us out!

529
01:00:43,749 --> 01:00:46,741
The image of America
will never again...

530
01:00:46,951 --> 01:00:52,218
...be the image of revolution,
freedom and democracy...

531
01:00:52,423 --> 01:00:54,891
...but the image
of violent imperialism!

532
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:00,092
Hey, Luce! Luce, come on,
stop worrying about it.

533
01:01:00,295 --> 01:01:01,592
Nothing's gonna happen to me.

534
01:01:01,797 --> 01:01:04,288
I could go in the Army
and not get shipped to anywhere.

535
01:01:04,498 --> 01:01:06,898
Play a lot of cards, learn how to box.

536
01:01:07,101 --> 01:01:09,626
Come on, look at this.
It's happening everywhere, man.

537
01:01:09,837 --> 01:01:13,796
Maybe LBJ will have a change of heart
and call the whole thing off, huh?

538
01:01:14,007 --> 01:01:16,601
This war is totally immoral!

539
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:25,876
- As soon as possible.
- Yeah, I can get it.

540
01:01:26,083 --> 01:01:28,210
Paco. This is Lucy Carrigan.

541
01:01:28,418 --> 01:01:30,352
She's an old friend.
She's not a student...

542
01:01:30,553 --> 01:01:32,783
...but she's interested in what we do.
Wanted to meet you.

543
01:01:32,988 --> 01:01:34,216
- Paco.
- Nice to meet you.

544
01:01:34,422 --> 01:01:35,855
How'd you hear about us?

545
01:01:36,057 --> 01:01:39,515
I saw you at the Fifth Avenue peace
march. I was moved by your speech.

546
01:01:45,832 --> 01:01:49,233
I'm thinking of renting the spare room
since Prudence split.

547
01:01:50,435 --> 01:01:51,663
Jesus, Max.

548
01:01:51,870 --> 01:01:54,634
Well, she's Prudence. She'll show.

549
01:01:57,675 --> 01:02:01,202
You're up before 2 and
looking wicked cool. Who's it for?

550
01:02:01,411 --> 01:02:05,074
- I have a meeting.
- Why, is that a prayer meeting?

551
01:02:05,614 --> 01:02:08,174
Yeah, for your twisted soul.

552
01:02:09,117 --> 01:02:12,848
- Put my shirt away when you're done.
- Yes, ma'am.

553
01:02:20,025 --> 01:02:21,515
What the hell was that?

554
01:02:22,126 --> 01:02:23,957
That's Dr. Robert.

555
01:02:25,164 --> 01:02:26,893
He's here to plug his book.

556
01:02:27,098 --> 01:02:28,963
Spread the word.

557
01:02:29,566 --> 01:02:32,034
There's a party for him tonight
if you wanna join me.

558
01:02:32,669 --> 01:02:34,967
We could celebrate.

559
01:02:35,171 --> 01:02:37,036
I haven't said yes yet, Bill.

560
01:02:37,239 --> 01:02:39,366
Sign with my label.

561
01:02:39,575 --> 01:02:43,306
I'll put you in a studio within a month
and get you a publishing deal.

562
01:02:45,112 --> 01:02:49,549
It sounds fantastic, man. But I still
gotta talk it over with the guys.

563
01:02:50,250 --> 01:02:51,842
No, you don't.

564
01:03:04,528 --> 01:03:08,692
- Whose place is this?
- Luna Park, Dr. Robert's publisher.

565
01:03:09,933 --> 01:03:13,300
There she is. Luna!

566
01:03:14,102 --> 01:03:17,435
Bill, good to see you.

567
01:03:17,638 --> 01:03:19,162
Luna Park.

568
01:03:19,439 --> 01:03:22,840
- Wow, this place is amazing.
- This is Sadie.

569
01:03:23,043 --> 01:03:27,446
Fabulous singer and future star,
if she's smart and signs with me.

570
01:03:27,647 --> 01:03:29,444
Oh, look at this, pink punch.

571
01:03:32,283 --> 01:03:33,978
Cheers.

572
01:03:34,818 --> 01:03:37,480
- You're not listening.
- Your guitar sound is a little lazy.

573
01:03:37,687 --> 01:03:40,315
- We need it tighter, not slick.
- This band gets behind me.

574
01:03:40,523 --> 01:03:44,687
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you Dr. Robert.

575
01:03:48,296 --> 01:03:53,324
Time is not on our hands, people.

576
01:03:54,268 --> 01:03:56,600
Time is slipping through them.

577
01:03:56,803 --> 01:04:01,365
We gotta transcend the bullshit,
and fast.

578
01:04:01,574 --> 01:04:06,807
But, hey, no point butting your heads
bucking the system.

579
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:11,115
Let them get all snarled up
in their dreary hive.

580
01:04:11,982 --> 01:04:15,042
Never knock the way
another cat swings, man.

581
01:04:21,822 --> 01:04:24,484
Hate to mess with your groove,
New York...

582
01:04:24,692 --> 01:04:27,820
...but we're about two years
ahead of you on the coast.

583
01:04:28,027 --> 01:04:32,020
We already graduated
from what's been going on...

584
01:04:32,230 --> 01:04:34,289
...to where it's gone.

585
01:04:36,167 --> 01:04:37,134
Amen.

586
01:07:19,964 --> 01:07:21,192
Nice. Nice.

587
01:07:21,633 --> 01:07:26,627
Love the people. Love the people.
We love the people.

588
01:07:49,154 --> 01:07:50,382
Where are we?

589
01:07:50,590 --> 01:07:54,549
I don't know.
And I don't know how we got here.

590
01:07:55,193 --> 01:07:56,785
What is that place?

591
01:07:56,994 --> 01:08:00,157
Headquarters of
the League of Spiritual Deliverance.

592
01:08:00,363 --> 01:08:03,127
The home of Dr. Geary.

593
01:08:03,332 --> 01:08:08,133
Another outlaw like myself.
We're navigators.

594
01:08:08,337 --> 01:08:11,067
We're aviators. We're...

595
01:08:11,272 --> 01:08:14,139
...eating taters.
Masturbating alligators.

596
01:08:14,341 --> 01:08:16,969
Bombardiers, we got no fears,
won't shed no tears.

597
01:08:17,177 --> 01:08:19,645
We're pushing the frontiers...

598
01:08:19,846 --> 01:08:22,508
...of transcendental perception.

599
01:08:22,715 --> 01:08:26,981
What's weird is we haven't met yet...

600
01:08:27,185 --> 01:08:30,086
...on this or any other plane.
- Hey, doc.

601
01:08:30,287 --> 01:08:33,313
- He says he won't see you, man.
- Why, is he sick?

602
01:08:33,523 --> 01:08:35,821
He just said he's busy.

603
01:08:37,426 --> 01:08:40,156
Did you tell that son of a bitch...

604
01:08:40,362 --> 01:08:44,025
...that we drove 3000 miles
to see him?

605
01:08:45,866 --> 01:08:48,994
- All right, everybody back on the bus.
- What?

606
01:08:49,202 --> 01:08:51,295
We're going home. California.

607
01:08:51,504 --> 01:08:52,766
- Doc?
- We just got here.

608
01:08:52,972 --> 01:08:55,167
- California isn't home to all of us.
- Yeah.

609
01:08:55,374 --> 01:09:00,676
What can I say? You're either
on the bus or off the bus.

610
01:09:03,580 --> 01:09:06,708
- Sayonara!
- Screw you!

611
01:09:06,917 --> 01:09:08,384
Oh, well, that's just perfect.

612
01:09:09,051 --> 01:09:11,919
My last blowout before the Army,
we're stuck in the middle of...

613
01:09:13,121 --> 01:09:16,090
- Where are we, huh?
- It doesn't matter.

614
01:09:16,290 --> 01:09:20,624
"I am me as you are he as you are
me and we are all together."

615
01:09:20,827 --> 01:09:22,351
That is so right. That's right.

616
01:09:22,561 --> 01:09:27,897
You know, and if nobody's everybody
then someone can be anybody, right?

617
01:09:29,266 --> 01:09:31,860
Listen. Do you hear the music?

618
01:09:39,075 --> 01:09:41,976
- Where are we going?
- We're going out of our minds.

619
01:09:42,177 --> 01:09:44,111
Come on, this way.

620
01:09:44,612 --> 01:09:47,012
- Where are you taking me?
- Down the rabbit hole.

621
01:09:47,213 --> 01:09:50,205
- Oh, I wanna feed the cow.
- Let's go.

622
01:09:51,051 --> 01:09:53,645
Oh, my God, Jude.

623
01:09:54,420 --> 01:09:56,183
Now, that's big.

624
01:10:23,410 --> 01:10:25,640
For the benefit of Mr. Kite

625
01:10:25,845 --> 01:10:29,611
There will be a show tonight
On trampoline

626
01:10:32,183 --> 01:10:36,244
The Hendersons will all be there
Late of Pablo Fanque's Fair

627
01:10:36,454 --> 01:10:39,082
Have you seen it?
It's great, they got stuff.

628
01:10:39,289 --> 01:10:41,223
Over men and horses
Hoops and garters

629
01:10:41,424 --> 01:10:44,450
Lastly through a hogshead
Of real fire

630
01:10:45,260 --> 01:10:48,855
In this way
Mr. K. Will challenge the world

631
01:10:49,064 --> 01:10:54,127
With the blue people. They're great.
They're just chilled out.

632
01:10:58,637 --> 01:11:00,468
I better heat you up.

633
01:11:35,734 --> 01:11:37,224
Is that Prudence?

634
01:11:39,771 --> 01:11:41,636
It is!

635
01:11:43,540 --> 01:11:44,973
Prudence!

636
01:11:45,175 --> 01:11:47,541
Hi, guys!

637
01:12:44,988 --> 01:12:46,717
Oh, man, that was amazing.

638
01:12:46,925 --> 01:12:49,758
That was bizarre, yo. That was...

639
01:12:51,695 --> 01:12:54,095
- Look at you, sweet pea.
- It's good to see you.

640
01:12:54,297 --> 01:12:57,425
- You too.
- Oh, I want you to meet Rita.

641
01:12:57,632 --> 01:12:59,691
She's a contortionist.

642
01:13:15,179 --> 01:13:19,946
Because the world is round

643
01:13:20,151 --> 01:13:26,454
It turns me on

644
01:13:45,837 --> 01:13:50,467
Because the wind is high

645
01:13:50,675 --> 01:13:57,137
It blows my mind

646
01:14:14,727 --> 01:14:19,460
Love is old, love is new

647
01:14:20,833 --> 01:14:26,294
Love is all, love is you

648
01:16:06,650 --> 01:16:09,050
Blood! Down! Down!

649
01:16:09,251 --> 01:16:10,809
Down!

650
01:17:08,565 --> 01:17:10,055
What time do you finish?

651
01:17:10,267 --> 01:17:12,462
I don't know.

652
01:17:13,870 --> 01:17:15,770
I love you.

653
01:17:32,585 --> 01:17:37,716
Something in the way she moves

654
01:17:41,025 --> 01:17:45,086
Attracts me like no other lover

655
01:17:47,264 --> 01:17:52,566
Something in the way she woos me

656
01:17:54,636 --> 01:17:57,332
I don't wanna leave her now

657
01:17:58,238 --> 01:18:01,036
You know I believe, and how

658
01:18:42,440 --> 01:18:47,844
You're asking me
Will my love grow

659
01:18:48,046 --> 01:18:50,173
I don't know

660
01:18:50,380 --> 01:18:54,749
I don't know

661
01:18:56,718 --> 01:19:01,985
You stick around
Now it may show

662
01:19:19,704 --> 01:19:21,604
Hey, you didn't get
my left nipple right.

663
01:19:21,806 --> 01:19:23,273
Oh, is that so?

664
01:19:24,508 --> 01:19:27,272
Well, you know,
you were lying on your side...

665
01:19:27,476 --> 01:19:29,808
...and I was drawing from a distance.

666
01:19:30,012 --> 01:19:33,948
So I couldn't see it properly.

667
01:19:45,158 --> 01:19:46,785
What time is it?

668
01:19:48,160 --> 01:19:50,958
- Eleven o'clock, I think.
- I gotta run.

669
01:19:52,897 --> 01:19:54,194
You didn't get in till 2:30.

670
01:19:54,398 --> 01:19:57,799
You know Columbia's top scientists are
working for the Defense Department?

671
01:19:58,002 --> 01:19:59,526
I didn't, no.

672
01:19:59,736 --> 01:20:03,001
There's gonna be this demonstration
on the campus to protest it.

673
01:20:03,205 --> 01:20:04,797
Paco says we need to radicalize.

674
01:20:05,240 --> 01:20:07,435
It's not enough
to just hand out leaflets...

675
01:20:07,642 --> 01:20:12,341
...and lie down in the middle of the
street and give flowers to cops.

676
01:20:12,547 --> 01:20:17,450
Well, will he give you time off
to go to Sadie's gig? Which is tonight.

677
01:20:18,150 --> 01:20:19,174
I'll try.

678
01:20:20,986 --> 01:20:23,147
Well, can you try harder?

679
01:20:27,058 --> 01:20:30,027
I can't believe you're telling me this.
And the rest of the guys?

680
01:20:30,227 --> 01:20:33,492
- I tried to tell you this a million times.
- So this is it?

681
01:20:33,763 --> 01:20:36,061
Oh, darlin'

682
01:20:37,599 --> 01:20:39,726
Please believe me

683
01:20:42,404 --> 01:20:46,738
I'll never do you no harm

684
01:20:49,576 --> 01:20:52,909
Believe me when I tell you

685
01:20:54,279 --> 01:20:58,238
I'll never do you no harm

686
01:21:08,123 --> 01:21:09,852
If you leave me

687
01:21:12,862 --> 01:21:17,231
I'll never make it alone

688
01:21:17,431 --> 01:21:18,989
I doubt that.

689
01:21:19,967 --> 01:21:23,095
Oh, believe me when I beg you

690
01:21:25,303 --> 01:21:29,000
Don't ever leave me alone

691
01:21:33,677 --> 01:21:35,304
What is this?

692
01:21:35,511 --> 01:21:36,876
When you told me

693
01:21:39,848 --> 01:21:41,475
You didn't need me anymore

694
01:21:49,757 --> 01:21:51,782
I don't believe this.

695
01:22:44,334 --> 01:22:46,564
Hey, where you going?

696
01:22:48,737 --> 01:22:50,068
Where were we?

697
01:23:13,557 --> 01:23:17,618
Oh, yeah, that's right, baby.
I don't need you. I'm gonna show you.

698
01:24:10,903 --> 01:24:13,531
What the hell happened, man?
Where'd Sadie go?

699
01:24:13,739 --> 01:24:17,175
Solo, man. Way solo.

700
01:24:40,060 --> 01:24:45,589
Hey, how's it going? Hope we're
not interrupting the creative flow.

701
01:24:48,665 --> 01:24:50,394
Still life?

702
01:24:50,801 --> 01:24:52,735
Yeah, yeah, it's...

703
01:24:53,169 --> 01:24:55,899
I'm sorry, what's that doing here?

704
01:24:56,105 --> 01:24:58,665
Well, you don't have one.
I had a spare.

705
01:24:58,875 --> 01:25:00,536
Where should I put it?

706
01:25:01,843 --> 01:25:04,004
Right here is fine for now.

707
01:25:04,478 --> 01:25:07,379
They're transmitting
live from Vietnam now.

708
01:25:07,580 --> 01:25:08,979
It's gonna make a difference.

709
01:25:09,183 --> 01:25:11,947
Bringing the war
right in the people's living room.

710
01:25:12,152 --> 01:25:15,485
Yeah, well, that's all well and good,
mate, but this isn't a living room.

711
01:25:17,756 --> 01:25:19,849
This is where I work.

712
01:25:28,799 --> 01:25:32,257
I'm sorry, he must really
be caught up with what he's doing.

713
01:25:32,668 --> 01:25:34,158
There you go.

714
01:25:36,703 --> 01:25:40,503
You should probably
try to get an outside antenna.

715
01:25:41,041 --> 01:25:43,703
I gotta go. You'll be there later?

716
01:25:43,911 --> 01:25:45,173
Yeah.

717
01:25:56,854 --> 01:26:00,153
Saigon command disclosed
that 5000 more U.S. Troops...

718
01:26:00,356 --> 01:26:02,290
...were committed to the war
last week...

719
01:26:02,492 --> 01:26:05,757
...bringing American troop strength
to over half a million men.

720
01:26:06,195 --> 01:26:08,857
The Vietcong assault
on South Vietnam cities...

721
01:26:09,064 --> 01:26:11,328
...produced record casualties
last week.

722
01:26:11,532 --> 01:26:13,932
Four hundred sixteen
Americans were killed...

723
01:26:14,134 --> 01:26:17,228
...and 15,029 wounded...

724
01:26:17,436 --> 01:26:21,463
...raising total U.S. Combat fatalities
in this country's longest war...

725
01:26:21,673 --> 01:26:23,971
...to 30,057.

726
01:29:42,333 --> 01:29:45,200
Well, I got a job.

727
01:29:46,103 --> 01:29:49,038
You know, as in,
"We'll pay you to do it."

728
01:29:51,008 --> 01:29:52,942
I thought you'd be pleased.

729
01:29:53,609 --> 01:29:54,735
What job?

730
01:29:54,944 --> 01:29:58,436
It's a logo
for Sadie's record company.

731
01:29:58,847 --> 01:30:00,747
It's a strawberry.

732
01:30:02,082 --> 01:30:07,110
You know, red, juicy, sexy.

733
01:30:07,854 --> 01:30:10,186
Yeah, get it? No?

734
01:30:12,024 --> 01:30:14,857
Why were you so rude
to Paco before?

735
01:30:16,027 --> 01:30:19,292
It wouldn't have killed you
to talk to him. He's got a good mind.

736
01:30:19,496 --> 01:30:21,430
He's committed,
he's involved, he's...

737
01:30:21,632 --> 01:30:23,759
- A shagger.
- A what?

738
01:30:24,167 --> 01:30:27,330
A shagger. A Don Juan.

739
01:30:28,570 --> 01:30:31,038
A seducer
of young, vulnerable women.

740
01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:35,468
Jude, you know nothing about him.

741
01:30:35,677 --> 01:30:38,441
Every time I go to your place,
there's about 50 people there.

742
01:30:38,645 --> 01:30:41,239
There's one bloke licking stamps
and the other 49 are...

743
01:30:41,447 --> 01:30:44,109
- Oh, they're all female.
- Don't exaggerate.

744
01:30:44,317 --> 01:30:46,649
Trust me, I'm not.

745
01:30:50,488 --> 01:30:52,115
We're in the middle of a revolution.

746
01:30:52,323 --> 01:30:55,520
What are you doing,
doodles and cartoons?

747
01:30:57,860 --> 01:31:00,624
- I didn't mean it like that.
- No?

748
01:31:00,962 --> 01:31:02,520
No? Well, what did you mean?

749
01:31:02,731 --> 01:31:05,461
Sorry I'm not the man with
the megaphone, this is what I do.

750
01:31:05,667 --> 01:31:07,999
You could at least hear
what he has to say.

751
01:31:08,202 --> 01:31:11,103
I suppose you don't, because
you're never gonna be drafted.

752
01:31:11,304 --> 01:31:12,669
Nor will you, Lucy.

753
01:31:13,306 --> 01:31:15,035
I would lie down in front of a tank...

754
01:31:15,240 --> 01:31:17,401
...if it would stop this war
and bring Max home.

755
01:31:17,609 --> 01:31:20,373
Yeah? Well, it wouldn't.

756
01:31:20,946 --> 01:31:24,404
What do you mean, it wouldn't?
You don't think that it's worth trying?

757
01:31:24,782 --> 01:31:26,079
I didn't say that. I'm...

758
01:31:26,283 --> 01:31:30,379
Well, maybe when bombs
start going off here, people will listen.

759
01:31:46,065 --> 01:31:49,364
You say you want a revolution

760
01:31:49,569 --> 01:31:51,696
Well, you know

761
01:31:53,205 --> 01:31:55,230
We all wanna change the world

762
01:31:55,439 --> 01:31:58,101
Jude, what are you doing?
I can't do this right now.

763
01:31:58,309 --> 01:32:01,710
You tell me that it's evolution

764
01:32:01,911 --> 01:32:05,312
Well, you know

765
01:32:05,515 --> 01:32:08,177
Yeah, we all wanna change the world

766
01:32:08,384 --> 01:32:10,579
Jude, please. Please, don't.

767
01:32:11,386 --> 01:32:14,378
But when you talk about destruction

768
01:32:15,255 --> 01:32:17,951
Don't you know
That you can count me out?

769
01:32:18,157 --> 01:32:20,785
- What are you doing here, friend?
- It's not the time. Not now.

770
01:32:20,993 --> 01:32:22,585
Don't you know it's gonna be
All right

771
01:32:22,795 --> 01:32:25,889
- Escort him to the door. Thank you.
- I'm sorry.

772
01:32:29,099 --> 01:32:30,760
Come on, let's go.

773
01:32:33,736 --> 01:32:36,227
I've never seen him like that.
I don't know.

774
01:32:42,711 --> 01:32:44,702
You gotta leave, buddy. Come on.

775
01:32:46,414 --> 01:32:48,905
- Jude!
- Who is this asshole?

776
01:33:09,865 --> 01:33:11,492
Jesus!

777
01:33:12,301 --> 01:33:13,495
Are you okay?

778
01:33:13,701 --> 01:33:16,101
Get this clown out of here now!

779
01:33:16,670 --> 01:33:17,796
Get him out of here!

780
01:33:25,678 --> 01:33:28,112
Don't hurt him! Don't hurt him!

781
01:33:37,822 --> 01:33:40,814
All right! All right!

782
01:33:46,061 --> 01:33:49,326
What is the matter with you?
Why would you do that?

783
01:34:07,245 --> 01:34:09,042
On the edge of the balcony
he was shot.

784
01:34:09,246 --> 01:34:10,873
We thought a firecracker
had gone on.

785
01:34:11,081 --> 01:34:13,174
Most of us were downstairs
on the lower level.

786
01:34:13,382 --> 01:34:15,350
Police have issued
an all-points bulletin...

787
01:34:15,551 --> 01:34:18,384
...for a well-dressed white man
seen running from the scene.

788
01:34:18,588 --> 01:34:20,852
We hold these truths
to be self-evident...

789
01:34:21,056 --> 01:34:23,149
...that all men are created equal.

790
01:34:23,357 --> 01:34:26,815
Memphis is a confused
and shocked city tonight.

791
01:34:27,027 --> 01:34:28,995
No one can believe
what has happened.

792
01:34:29,195 --> 01:34:31,129
It's been just a little over an hour...

793
01:34:31,330 --> 01:34:34,663
...since Dr. Martin Luther King died
from an assassin's bullet.

794
01:34:34,867 --> 01:34:38,428
Dr. King was rushed to St. Joseph's
Hospital emergency room.

795
01:34:38,636 --> 01:34:41,764
He died from a gunshot wound
in the neck.

796
01:34:42,772 --> 01:34:45,366
I'm sick and tired of violence.

797
01:34:45,575 --> 01:34:49,238
I'm tired of the war in Vietnam.

798
01:34:50,346 --> 01:34:54,510
I look at you all

799
01:34:54,716 --> 01:34:59,915
See the love there that's sleeping

800
01:35:00,120 --> 01:35:06,525
While my guitar gently weeps

801
01:35:08,126 --> 01:35:11,721
I look at the floor

802
01:35:11,929 --> 01:35:16,389
And I see it needs sweeping

803
01:35:17,601 --> 01:35:24,564
Still my guitar gently weeps

804
01:35:31,444 --> 01:35:36,108
Not now. What is this ridiculous
bullshit? He can't even play guitar.

805
01:35:37,683 --> 01:35:42,120
The sound sucked out there.
How many times...?

806
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:45,517
Get out there and tell Tony to fix it
or I don't go on tomorrow night.

807
01:35:45,722 --> 01:35:48,714
Come on, Sadie,
it's the ratty end of the tour. Cool it.

808
01:35:51,261 --> 01:35:53,320
Find me someone
who can play the guitar, man.

809
01:35:53,529 --> 01:35:56,362
This new guy's
got no soul and no stank.

810
01:37:34,610 --> 01:37:37,010
Do you wanna come up
for one more, Jo?

811
01:37:38,380 --> 01:37:40,439
I ain't gonna find Sadie there, man.

812
01:37:41,382 --> 01:37:43,816
You better go on up to Lucy.

813
01:37:44,350 --> 01:37:45,783
Yeah.

814
01:37:45,986 --> 01:37:49,046
Well, she's probably out
fighting for the cause, you know?

815
01:37:49,255 --> 01:37:52,053
It look like you been
fighting for it too, huh?

816
01:37:53,425 --> 01:37:56,622
I don't have one.
That's the problem.

817
01:38:58,476 --> 01:39:04,142
Words are flowing out
Like endless rain into a paper cup

818
01:39:04,348 --> 01:39:06,680
They slither while they pass

819
01:39:06,883 --> 01:39:11,582
They slip away
Across the universe

820
01:39:11,787 --> 01:39:17,919
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy
Are drifting through my open mind

821
01:39:18,126 --> 01:39:22,222
Possessing and caressing me

822
01:39:33,004 --> 01:39:37,941
Nothing's gonna change my world

823
01:39:45,682 --> 01:39:48,378
Images of broken light

824
01:39:48,584 --> 01:39:52,543
Which dance before me
Like a million eyes

825
01:39:52,754 --> 01:39:57,782
They call me on and on
Across the universe

826
01:39:58,390 --> 01:40:04,351
Thoughts meander like a restless wind
Inside a letterbox

827
01:40:04,563 --> 01:40:11,662
They tumble blindly as they
Make their way across the universe

828
01:40:11,869 --> 01:40:14,895
Strike! Strike! Strike!

829
01:41:20,957 --> 01:41:23,721
No! No!

830
01:41:32,767 --> 01:41:33,961
Lucy!

831
01:41:34,968 --> 01:41:37,937
- Jude!
- Lucy!

832
01:41:44,476 --> 01:41:46,671
- Jude!
- Lucy!

833
01:41:53,549 --> 01:41:56,177
- Jude!
- Lucy!

834
01:42:29,745 --> 01:42:32,236
Die! Die!

835
01:44:05,155 --> 01:44:06,782
You have a visitor.

836
01:44:12,728 --> 01:44:14,389
What are you doing here?

837
01:44:14,595 --> 01:44:17,189
I got a call from a friend of yours,
a girl.

838
01:44:17,397 --> 01:44:20,389
Said that you were in trouble,
so I came down.

839
01:44:20,900 --> 01:44:22,765
Are you all right?

840
01:44:29,874 --> 01:44:35,574
I told the cops that I was a
U.S. Citizen and you were my son.

841
01:44:36,512 --> 01:44:40,073
- What did they say?
- They wanted proof.

842
01:44:41,217 --> 01:44:43,082
I didn't have any.

843
01:44:45,020 --> 01:44:48,820
I talked the cops out of pressing
charges for the riot and stuff...

844
01:44:49,023 --> 01:44:51,890
...but the bottom line,
this is an immigration issue.

845
01:44:52,092 --> 01:44:54,151
Meaning they're
kicking me out of the country?

846
01:44:54,360 --> 01:44:57,090
- I'm afraid so.
- Shit.

847
01:45:04,535 --> 01:45:07,470
Thanks... Thanks for trying,
though, yeah?

848
01:45:13,075 --> 01:45:15,703
Have you told your mother
you met me?

849
01:45:18,646 --> 01:45:20,238
Not yet.

850
01:45:24,117 --> 01:45:26,551
But... But l... But I will.

851
01:45:44,267 --> 01:45:45,928
Look who's coming.

852
01:45:49,238 --> 01:45:52,867
- How's it going, Jude?
- I'm okay, yeah.

853
01:45:53,607 --> 01:45:55,336
So when did you and Phil hitch up?

854
01:45:55,543 --> 01:45:58,103
About two weeks
after you stopped writing.

855
01:45:59,312 --> 01:46:03,612
Oh, I'm pleased for you, though.
And a kid's on the way.

856
01:46:03,816 --> 01:46:05,181
That's great.

857
01:46:06,284 --> 01:46:09,082
- What was the name?
- Who?

858
01:46:09,520 --> 01:46:11,715
The reason you stopped writing.

859
01:46:14,625 --> 01:46:16,786
Her name was Lucy.

860
01:46:17,894 --> 01:46:21,352
It was... It was good
for a while, you know.

861
01:46:21,663 --> 01:46:23,426
It all seems a bit unreal.

862
01:46:24,498 --> 01:46:26,557
Is this real enough for you?

863
01:46:28,202 --> 01:46:29,931
Glad to be back?

864
01:46:30,137 --> 01:46:34,267
Yeah. Yeah. I couldn't be happier.

865
01:46:42,413 --> 01:46:48,374
She's not a girl
Who misses much

866
01:47:26,815 --> 01:47:29,909
I'll be here same time next week,
okay?

867
01:47:41,660 --> 01:47:45,494
I need a fix
'Cause I'm going down

868
01:47:56,139 --> 01:48:00,007
Mother Superior jumped the gun

869
01:48:22,292 --> 01:48:26,922
Happiness is a warm gun

870
01:48:36,703 --> 01:48:40,434
When I hold you
In my arms

871
01:48:41,141 --> 01:48:45,237
And when I feel
My finger on your trigger

872
01:48:46,245 --> 01:48:50,375
Oh, don't you know
Nobody can do me no harm

873
01:49:42,991 --> 01:49:46,256
Stop telling me this is a peaceful
march. It's much worse than that.

874
01:49:46,460 --> 01:49:48,394
The dogs and the violence...

875
01:49:48,595 --> 01:49:52,031
...and the people you're with are more
radical than you want me to believe.

876
01:49:52,231 --> 01:49:57,567
They should be radical. You should
be radical. We should all be radical.

877
01:49:57,769 --> 01:50:00,294
Daniel is dead
and Max is all fucked up...

878
01:50:00,504 --> 01:50:03,564
...and this war just keeps going
on and on and nobody's listening.

879
01:50:03,773 --> 01:50:05,866
- I'm listening.
- No, you're not listening.

880
01:50:06,075 --> 01:50:09,567
I just don't want
my beautiful daughter to get hurt.

881
01:50:10,379 --> 01:50:13,974
Look, Mom. Don't cry.

882
01:50:14,716 --> 01:50:16,547
Please don't cry.

883
01:50:17,251 --> 01:50:19,719
Everything's really okay here,
I promise.

884
01:50:23,824 --> 01:50:25,519
It's gonna be all right, I gotta go.

885
01:52:16,379 --> 01:52:18,006
Close the door.

886
01:52:22,752 --> 01:52:25,949
I thought it was the other side
who dropped bombs.

887
01:52:57,579 --> 01:52:59,547
- Thanks, mate.
- Thanks.

888
01:54:04,265 --> 01:54:09,066
Blackbird singing
In the dead of night

889
01:54:09,970 --> 01:54:16,034
Take these broken wings
And learn to fly

890
01:54:16,775 --> 01:54:21,075
All your life

891
01:54:21,579 --> 01:54:24,309
You were only waiting

892
01:54:24,515 --> 01:54:28,815
For this moment to arise

893
01:54:31,921 --> 01:54:37,655
Blackbird fly

894
01:54:38,793 --> 01:54:44,163
Blackbird fly

895
01:54:44,931 --> 01:54:50,927
Into the light of the dark black night

896
01:55:26,831 --> 01:55:28,731
- Here, love.
- Thanks.

897
01:55:42,277 --> 01:55:44,040
Last call, pal.

898
01:55:56,421 --> 01:56:01,586
Hey, Jude
Don't make it bad

899
01:56:02,893 --> 01:56:08,957
Take a sad song
And make it better

900
01:56:10,366 --> 01:56:15,394
Remember
To let her into your heart

901
01:56:15,870 --> 01:56:21,831
Then you can start
To make it better

902
01:58:57,966 --> 01:59:00,366
Max!

903
01:59:07,707 --> 01:59:09,072
You don't look too messed up.

904
01:59:09,275 --> 01:59:12,403
Yeah, well, everything
below the neck works fine.

905
01:59:15,479 --> 01:59:17,174
Does she know?

906
01:59:19,016 --> 01:59:21,610
- You didn't tell her.
- Nope.

907
01:59:21,819 --> 01:59:23,650
All right, good. Good.

908
01:59:23,853 --> 01:59:27,152
Hey, this is your Cousin Brucie
at 720 WWEN...

909
01:59:27,356 --> 01:59:29,984
...in a live broadcast
from the top of the world with...

910
01:59:33,961 --> 01:59:35,690
- Is that Sadie?
- You got that right.

911
01:59:36,464 --> 01:59:38,728
Shit, we're late.

912
01:59:42,001 --> 01:59:44,731
Don't let me down

913
01:59:53,010 --> 01:59:58,073
Nobody ever loved me like he does

914
02:00:05,954 --> 02:00:10,050
And if somebody loved me
Like she do me

915
02:00:11,658 --> 02:00:14,126
Ooh, she do me

916
02:00:14,626 --> 02:00:18,357
Yes, she does

917
02:01:19,813 --> 02:01:23,544
- Yeah!
- Hey, Prudence.

918
02:01:24,616 --> 02:01:26,447
- How are you?
- Good. Welcome back.

919
02:01:26,651 --> 02:01:27,640
Where's Lucy?

920
02:01:27,852 --> 02:01:29,479
Don't know.
She should be on her way.

921
02:01:29,686 --> 02:01:33,452
- Did you give her the right address?
- Yeah. I thought I saw her on the street.

922
02:01:33,657 --> 02:01:35,318
Oh, shit.

923
02:01:36,092 --> 02:01:37,525
Let's go.

924
02:01:38,895 --> 02:01:39,919
Spread out.

925
02:01:50,670 --> 02:01:52,137
That's it. Wrap it up. Let's go.

926
02:01:52,338 --> 02:01:55,774
You have no permit. You're disturbing
the peace. Come on, off the roof.

927
02:01:57,209 --> 02:01:58,335
- Come on.
- Thank you!

928
02:01:59,177 --> 02:02:00,201
It's all over.

929
02:02:00,412 --> 02:02:02,812
- Come on, let's go.
- Feels good to be back, baby.

930
02:02:03,014 --> 02:02:04,379
Yeah!

931
02:02:04,582 --> 02:02:07,050
Come on, we gotta clear the roof.
Let's go.

932
02:02:08,451 --> 02:02:10,749
- Hey. Be nice, be nice.
- All right. Keep moving.

933
02:02:10,953 --> 02:02:12,978
- Yeah, yeah.
- Joy. Happiness.

934
02:02:13,188 --> 02:02:15,281
That's right.
Background singers, huh?

935
02:02:15,491 --> 02:02:18,187
- Where did Jude go?
- I don't know. And where is my sister?

936
02:02:18,393 --> 02:02:19,724
I'm sure I saw her, Max.

937
02:02:25,198 --> 02:02:26,927
I don't understand
what the problem is.

938
02:02:27,133 --> 02:02:29,294
Man, get your hands off me.

939
02:02:55,388 --> 02:02:58,516
There's nothing you can do
That can't be done

940
02:03:00,560 --> 02:03:03,324
Nothing you can sing
That can't be sung

941
02:03:03,929 --> 02:03:04,918
What?

942
02:03:05,530 --> 02:03:06,656
Nothing you can say

943
02:03:06,865 --> 02:03:09,390
But you can
Learn how to play the game

944
02:03:10,100 --> 02:03:11,533
Who the hell is that?

945
02:03:11,735 --> 02:03:13,532
- Jude?
- It's Jude.

946
02:03:15,672 --> 02:03:18,971
There's nothing you can make
That can't be made

947
02:03:20,642 --> 02:03:24,203
No one you can save
That can't be saved

948
02:03:25,379 --> 02:03:29,372
Nothing you can do but you can
Learn how to be you in time

949
02:03:29,650 --> 02:03:31,641
It's easy

950
02:03:32,819 --> 02:03:35,879
Hey, that means you too. Let's go.

951
02:03:43,961 --> 02:03:46,555
All you need is love

952
02:03:51,166 --> 02:03:53,760
- Hey, kid! Get your ass out of here!
- Let him stay.

953
02:03:54,168 --> 02:03:56,363
Come on. Come on, out of my way.

954
02:03:58,372 --> 02:03:59,930
Let's go.

955
02:04:03,844 --> 02:04:05,675
Plug it in.

956
02:04:08,513 --> 02:04:09,502
- All right.
- Thanks.

957
02:04:09,714 --> 02:04:11,045
That's great.

958
02:04:28,597 --> 02:04:31,657
Oh, please, you have to let me
through. I need to get up there.

959
02:04:35,502 --> 02:04:39,461
- I can't believe this.
- The roof is closed. The roof is closed.
