00:00:25,982 --> 00:00:30,247
# Gonna be a flare up

2
00:00:30,334 --> 00:00:33,772
# Flare up

3
00:00:33,859 --> 00:00:36,949
# Flare up

4
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,821
# Flare up

5
00:01:19,296 --> 00:01:20,558
# Flare up

6
00:01:22,647 --> 00:01:23,866
# Flare up

7
00:01:25,911 --> 00:01:27,043
# Flare up

8
00:01:58,422 --> 00:02:00,207
# Flare up

9
00:02:00,294 --> 00:02:01,773
# Flare up

10
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,297
# Flare up

11
00:02:03,384 --> 00:02:04,646
# Flare up

12
00:02:08,171 --> 00:02:09,738
# Flare up

13
00:02:43,946 --> 00:02:45,382
Riviera.

14
00:04:16,952 --> 00:04:18,562
I don't see Nikki.Mm.

15
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:20,085
There's a table.

16
00:04:20,172 --> 00:04:22,087
I hope Nikki doesn't make us
late to rehearsals.

17
00:04:22,174 --> 00:04:24,089
I think you're just worried
about that new guitar player.

18
00:04:24,176 --> 00:04:26,091
Afraid he'll
get restless.

19
00:04:26,178 --> 00:04:30,052
Well, I'm the only girl
he's dated three times in a row.

20
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:31,880
I'll just have, um, iced tea
right now.

21
00:04:31,967 --> 00:04:33,447
There's one
other person coming.

22
00:04:33,534 --> 00:04:35,449
Mm. That's fine
for me too, thanks.

23
00:04:40,932 --> 00:04:42,238
Nikki?

24
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:46,373
Don't make
such a face.

25
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:48,766
I just want a chance to talk
to you for a minute.

26
00:04:48,853 --> 00:04:50,551
We've talked
a hundred times, Alan.

27
00:04:50,638 --> 00:04:51,726
It's over!

28
00:04:51,813 --> 00:04:53,902
Because a judge said so?

29
00:04:53,989 --> 00:04:55,338
Look, I'll admit
I made mistakes,

30
00:04:55,425 --> 00:04:58,341
but that doesn't cancel
out all the good things.

31
00:04:58,428 --> 00:05:00,952
In the beginning,
remember?

32
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,171
We'll go back
to San Francisco.

33
00:05:02,258 --> 00:05:03,433
You loved it there.

34
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,609
Ah, no.Coming here was our mistake.

35
00:05:05,696 --> 00:05:07,263
That's where we blew it.

36
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:10,962
You dancing in that club
and getting your mind poisoned

37
00:05:11,049 --> 00:05:12,050
by those girls.

38
00:05:12,137 --> 00:05:13,661
Especially that Michele.

39
00:05:13,748 --> 00:05:16,141
Alan, we left San Francisco
because you blamed it

40
00:05:16,228 --> 00:05:17,795
on your bad luck.

41
00:05:17,882 --> 00:05:19,754
We left Reno
for the same reason.

42
00:05:19,841 --> 00:05:22,104
Now you're blaming it
on Las Vegas.

43
00:05:22,191 --> 00:05:23,235
Maybe it's me.

44
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,760
You?

45
00:05:25,847 --> 00:05:29,372
You're the only thing
I ever loved!

46
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:30,939
I'm sorry, Alan.

47
00:05:42,385 --> 00:05:44,996
Hi.Hi. It's about time!

48
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:46,607
Robaire was
in a creative mood.

49
00:05:46,694 --> 00:05:48,348
Oh.

50
00:05:48,435 --> 00:05:50,698
What are you having?A salad.

51
00:05:50,785 --> 00:05:52,090
I'm having
Eggs Benedict.

52
00:05:52,177 --> 00:05:54,136
Are we still
going shopping?

53
00:05:54,223 --> 00:05:55,398
Yes, I think
we still have time.

54
00:05:55,485 --> 00:05:56,268
Well, do you think
we have time?

55
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,183
Um-hm.

56
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:00,142
Nikki. Come
with me now!

57
00:06:00,229 --> 00:06:01,186
Excuse me.

58
00:06:01,273 --> 00:06:03,275
Alan, please!

59
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,276
Nikki!

60
00:07:05,337 --> 00:07:07,339
Oh, my God!

61
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,950
Get a doctor!

62
00:07:09,037 --> 00:07:10,734
Please, somebody,
get a doctor!

63
00:07:12,649 --> 00:07:14,782
You see Alan...

64
00:07:14,869 --> 00:07:19,482
never let up on Nikki,
not once, since the divorce.

65
00:07:19,569 --> 00:07:21,441
He was pretty rough
on Iris and I too.

66
00:07:21,528 --> 00:07:22,877
We were her witnesses.

67
00:07:22,964 --> 00:07:24,835
So he blamed the two of you
for the divorce?

68
00:07:24,922 --> 00:07:26,141
Yeah.

69
00:07:26,228 --> 00:07:29,100
Well, he blamed everyone
but himself.

70
00:07:29,187 --> 00:07:31,755
I just never thought
he'd go this far.

71
00:07:31,842 --> 00:07:34,192
She's still
in surgery?

72
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:37,413
Oh, I see.
Thank you.

73
00:07:41,373 --> 00:07:43,941
The doctors won't know anything
for hours yet.

74
00:07:46,117 --> 00:07:47,641
May we go now,
lieutenant?

75
00:07:47,728 --> 00:07:49,469
Uh, just as soon as you've
signed your statements.

76
00:07:49,556 --> 00:07:50,948
What've you got,
Franklin?

77
00:07:51,035 --> 00:07:54,561
Alan Leroy Morris,
D.O.B. three-24-45,

78
00:07:54,648 --> 00:07:56,388
Oakland, California.

79
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:59,261
Most recent occupation assistant
manager at the Electric Club.

80
00:07:59,348 --> 00:08:00,523
Did you check it out?

81
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:02,351
He hasn't worked there
in a week.

82
00:08:02,438 --> 00:08:03,613
Ah.

83
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,528
Two falls:
possession of narcotics,

84
00:08:05,615 --> 00:08:08,488
one dismissed, one probation
to a plead of guilty.

85
00:08:08,575 --> 00:08:11,839
Two arrests, suspicion
of assault against his wife.

86
00:08:11,926 --> 00:08:14,058
We never did know
who he blamed that one on.

87
00:08:14,145 --> 00:08:15,495
If you'll please
sign these.

88
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:21,283
Alright, I want copies
of these plastered

89
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:22,502
all over Las Vegas.

90
00:08:22,589 --> 00:08:24,460
Every hotel, bar,
the works.

91
00:08:24,547 --> 00:08:25,461
I'll get it
to Communications right away.

92
00:08:25,548 --> 00:08:26,767
Oh, just
a minute!

93
00:08:26,854 --> 00:08:27,898
If you need us, we'll be
in the hospital.

94
00:08:27,985 --> 00:08:29,421
Wait a minute.

95
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,336
Lloyd can't spare two girls
from the show

96
00:08:31,423 --> 00:08:33,077
and you've got
the specialty.

97
00:08:33,164 --> 00:08:34,601
Yeah, big deal.

98
00:08:34,688 --> 00:08:37,255
It's only fair
to him.

99
00:08:37,342 --> 00:08:39,301
Okay. Well, I'll meet you over
there soon as I can.

100
00:08:39,388 --> 00:08:40,694
Just a moment,
please.

101
00:08:40,781 --> 00:08:42,478
I want Bryan assigned to Iris.

102
00:08:42,565 --> 00:08:44,132
I want her to go the
hospital and stay with her

103
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:48,310
at all times.
I'll assign Medford to Michele.

104
00:08:48,397 --> 00:08:51,661
Now, wait just a second.
What's all this about?

105
00:08:51,748 --> 00:08:54,098
Morris tried to kill
all three of you.

106
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:59,234
He's right, Michele.
I'll see you at the hospital.

107
00:08:59,321 --> 00:09:02,063
That's all I need is someone
following me all around.

108
00:09:06,328 --> 00:09:07,372
Look, I know all you're trying
to do is help,

109
00:09:07,459 --> 00:09:09,157
but I keep thinking
of Nikki.

110
00:09:09,244 --> 00:09:11,507
She had a restraining order,
and a lot of good that did her!

111
00:09:11,594 --> 00:09:13,117
Are you refusing
police protection?

112
00:09:15,119 --> 00:09:17,774
If you really want to help me
just find Alan!

113
00:09:25,826 --> 00:09:29,830
I want Medford assigned to that
club where those girls dance.

114
00:09:29,917 --> 00:09:31,919
Right.

115
00:11:07,536 --> 00:11:08,842
Honey, don't
you worry.

116
00:11:08,929 --> 00:11:10,104
Nikki'll be
alright.

117
00:11:10,191 --> 00:11:11,366
I feel it.

118
00:11:11,453 --> 00:11:13,281
Should I phone
the hospital again?

119
00:11:13,368 --> 00:11:14,804
No!

120
00:11:14,891 --> 00:11:17,502
Just leave me alone.

121
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:22,943
I'm sorry.

122
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,604
I phoned Iris
a little while ago.

123
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:35,346
She said...

124
00:11:35,433 --> 00:11:37,740
she'd let me know
if there's any change.

125
00:11:37,827 --> 00:11:40,134
She'll be alright.
I feel it.

126
00:11:40,221 --> 00:11:42,005
That screwball.

127
00:11:42,092 --> 00:11:43,746
To do that to Nikki.

128
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:45,226
She'll be
alright.

129
00:11:45,313 --> 00:11:46,227
Oh, Jackie,
turn the record over.

130
00:11:47,968 --> 00:11:49,534
Michele, can I see you
for a moment?

131
00:11:49,621 --> 00:11:51,536
Yeah. Come on in,
Lloyd.

132
00:11:51,623 --> 00:11:52,624
Oh, damn!

133
00:11:54,148 --> 00:11:56,280
Are you sure you feel well
enough to work?

134
00:11:59,588 --> 00:12:01,851
Yeah, yeah.
I feel fine.

135
00:12:01,938 --> 00:12:03,940
Might even make me feel better
to get my mind off it

136
00:12:04,027 --> 00:12:05,376
for a little while.

137
00:12:08,989 --> 00:12:11,034
I'll phone the hospital again
while you're on.

138
00:12:11,121 --> 00:12:12,732
Yeah.
Okay. Thanks.

139
00:12:12,819 --> 00:12:15,778
And, uh, don't you worry.
She'll be alright.

140
00:12:15,865 --> 00:12:17,127
Jackie!

141

Yes, could I, could I
have a report on the condition

171
00:14:18,379 --> 00:14:20,424
of Mrs. Nikki Morris, please?

172
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,170
Thank you.

173
00:15:16,828 --> 00:15:18,787
And there they go,
ladies and gentlemen,

174
00:15:18,874 --> 00:15:21,833
the most beautiful girls
in Las Vegas.

175
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:25,576
Each and every one of them
is looking for a husband, so...

176
00:15:25,663 --> 00:15:27,927
If any of you husbands
are looking--

177
00:15:31,191 --> 00:15:32,496
--there'll be another show
right away.

178
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:34,194
So drink a few rounds,
folks.

179
00:15:34,281 --> 00:15:36,936
It will be a blast.

180
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:45,901
Jackie?

181
00:15:45,988 --> 00:15:48,208
Jackie, are you looking
for the tall, blond guy?

182
00:15:48,295 --> 00:15:49,949
We're going to a party.
He was my date.

183
00:15:50,036 --> 00:15:51,559
I know.
I broke the date.

184
00:15:51,646 --> 00:15:53,778
Listen! Just because
you're my boss doesn't mean

185
00:15:53,865 --> 00:15:55,128
you can break dates
for me.

186
00:15:55,215 --> 00:15:57,130
That isn't--He's bad news, Jackie.

187
00:15:57,217 --> 00:15:58,914
Take my word for it.

188
00:16:04,528 --> 00:16:06,878
Razor blade time
of night, huh?

189
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,359
Yeah.
I've had it!

190
00:16:09,446 --> 00:16:11,840
Lloyd, he bugs me.
He really bugs me!

191
00:16:11,927 --> 00:16:13,885
You know what he did?
He broke my date with Tony,

192
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,323
that good looking blond
I was taking to Billy's party!

193
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:19,152
Who does he think he is,
my father or something?

194
00:16:19,239 --> 00:16:21,763
I mean, if I can't go out
with whomsoever I please,

195
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:24,461
I might as well be married
or something!

196
00:16:24,548 --> 00:16:26,855
Honestly,
I'm speechless!

197
00:16:26,942 --> 00:16:28,074
That'll be the day.

198
00:16:29,771 --> 00:16:31,425
Hey, why don't you come
to the party?

199
00:16:31,512 --> 00:16:33,166
It'd do you good.Oh, not me.

200
00:16:33,253 --> 00:16:34,297
Not tonight.

201
00:16:34,384 --> 00:16:36,647
Oh, come on.
It'll be a blast!

202
00:16:36,734 --> 00:16:39,650
You know who's gonna be there?
Matteo Albrin.

203
00:16:39,737 --> 00:16:41,130
Who?

204
00:16:41,217 --> 00:16:43,002
The actor,
Matteo Albrin.

205
00:16:43,089 --> 00:16:44,568
You mean you never heard
of him?

206
00:16:44,655 --> 00:16:47,919
Shall we all face the East
and bow three times?

207
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,269
Thanks a lot, Jackie,
but I don't know,

208
00:16:49,356 --> 00:16:50,400
parties are kinds
like pot.

209
00:16:50,487 --> 00:16:51,706
When you're up,
they're fine,

210
00:16:51,793 --> 00:16:53,229
but when you're down,
they're nothing.

211
00:16:53,316 --> 00:16:55,579
Besides, I was going
to the hospital just now.

212
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:59,061
Oh, well, if you see Nikki,
be sure and give her my love.

213
00:16:59,148 --> 00:17:02,456
And tell her that everything's
gonna be alright.

214
00:17:02,543 --> 00:17:04,545
Okay.

215
00:17:04,632 --> 00:17:06,982
You're all tensed up.Yeah.

216
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:10,464
Why don't you meet me later
for a drink?

217
00:17:10,551 --> 00:17:13,380
I could help you freak out
on this whole thing.

218
00:17:13,467 --> 00:17:15,730
Hey, listen,
you've got the wrong girl.

219
00:17:15,817 --> 00:17:17,340
Easy, easy.

220
00:17:17,427 --> 00:17:20,343
Listen,
leave me alone!

221
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:22,302
That makes you right
and me wrong, huh?

222
00:17:22,389 --> 00:17:24,130
It's not a question
of right or wrong.

223
00:17:24,217 --> 00:17:28,003
It's just a question of what
appeals to me and what doesn't.

224
00:17:29,352 --> 00:17:30,788
Okay.
That's that then.

225
00:17:58,512 --> 00:17:59,513
Are you alright?

226
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,557
Nikki's gone!

227
00:18:02,037 --> 00:18:03,647
She just died.

228
00:18:06,781 --> 00:18:09,610
They brought her down
from recovery.

229
00:18:09,697 --> 00:18:12,003
And a little while ago
she starts hemorrhaging.

230
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,309
Shh.

231
00:18:13,396 --> 00:18:15,355
It's okay.
Come on, let's go.

232
00:18:30,848 --> 00:18:32,850
The car's over there.
I'll take you home.

233
00:18:32,937 --> 00:18:34,243
No, thanks.
I've got my own car.

234
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:35,201
You shouldn't be
by yourself.

235
00:18:35,288 --> 00:18:36,463
Now, come home
with me.

236
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:38,726
I just want to be alone
right now.

237
00:18:56,918 --> 00:18:57,919
Oh!

238
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,757
No.

239
00:19:56,107 --> 00:19:57,587
Please, please!

240
00:19:57,674 --> 00:19:59,981
Miss!
You've gotta wait.

241
00:20:00,068 --> 00:20:01,722
No!

242
00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:04,638
But the police are gonna want
to talk to you.

243
00:20:04,725 --> 00:20:06,117
You are a witness,
miss!

244
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,119
Get out of my way!

245
00:21:07,178 --> 00:21:10,051
I heard on the radio
that cop died.

246
00:21:10,138 --> 00:21:12,227
"That cop"
was 28 years old.

247
00:21:12,314 --> 00:21:14,447
His second child
was born last week

248
00:21:14,534 --> 00:21:16,405
and he was one of the best men
in the department.

249
00:21:16,492 --> 00:21:17,450
I'm sorry.

250
00:21:17,537 --> 00:21:18,538
Yeah, me too.

251
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:19,539
Did you find Michele?

252
00:21:19,626 --> 00:21:20,844
Not a trace.

253
00:21:20,931 --> 00:21:22,193
What the hell's
she trying to do?

254
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,586
Get herself killed?

255
00:21:27,547 --> 00:21:30,506
I checked with the other girls
like you asked me to.

256
00:21:30,593 --> 00:21:32,378
They couldn't come up
with a thing.

257
00:21:32,465 --> 00:21:33,596
No boyfriend's place?

258
00:21:33,683 --> 00:21:36,120
No, there's
no special guy.

259
00:21:36,207 --> 00:21:38,035
At least not
like that.

260
00:21:38,122 --> 00:21:39,210
What about relatives?

261
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,691
Well, the kid's
a real loner.

262
00:21:41,778 --> 00:21:44,128
Nikki.

263
00:21:44,215 --> 00:21:45,478
Iris.

264
00:21:45,565 --> 00:21:47,393
And if he catches up
with Michele...

265
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:50,265
We've got the whole town covered
like a blanket.

266
00:21:50,352 --> 00:21:51,832
Is there anything you can
come up with on the guy?

267
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:55,662
You've got it all.

268
00:21:55,749 --> 00:21:56,880
You know, I try
to keep the girls straight

269
00:21:56,967 --> 00:21:59,492
about these foul balls.

270
00:21:59,579 --> 00:22:02,016
And I had that one pegged.

271
00:22:02,103 --> 00:22:04,279
But Nikki was married
to him.

272
00:22:04,366 --> 00:22:07,630
That stopped me cold.

273
00:22:07,717 --> 00:22:09,937
I wish I'd opened my big mouth.

274
00:22:10,024 --> 00:22:11,721
It's not your fault.

275
00:22:11,808 --> 00:22:14,594
I know you take pretty good care
of your girls.

276
00:22:14,681 --> 00:22:16,987
I didn't do such
a great job this time.

277
00:22:17,074 --> 00:22:18,772
You didn't make
this world, either.

278
00:22:23,124 --> 00:22:26,432
You know, it might pay off
for us.

279
00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:29,478
You're the one person Michele
might get in touch with.

280
00:22:29,565 --> 00:22:31,915
I hope you're right.

281
00:22:32,002 --> 00:22:33,700
Find that guy.

282
00:22:35,005 --> 00:22:36,180
Yeah.

283
00:23:44,161 --> 00:23:46,120
Operator?

284
00:23:46,207 --> 00:23:51,473
Uh, yes. I'd like to make
a person-to-person call.

285
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:54,258
Do you want me to line up
a replacement for the show?

286
00:23:54,345 --> 00:23:56,217
At least for the weekend?

287
00:23:56,304 --> 00:23:57,653
I guess maybe you'd better.

288
00:23:59,002 --> 00:24:01,875
Who can you get?Hello.

289
00:24:01,962 --> 00:24:03,485
Well, there's always
Marie Chang.

290
00:24:03,572 --> 00:24:05,008
Yeah,
please.

291
00:24:05,095 --> 00:24:07,097
If you can stand
the boa constrictor.

292
00:24:07,184 --> 00:24:08,882
Oh, thanks a lot.

293
00:24:08,969 --> 00:24:11,319
Lloyd. It's long distance,
Los Angeles.

294
00:24:14,627 --> 00:24:15,758
Yeah?
Who's calling?

295
00:24:15,845 --> 00:24:17,673
Put her on.

296
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,414
Michele,
are you alright?

297
00:24:19,501 --> 00:24:21,895
Lloyd. Oh, don't worry about me.

298
00:24:21,982 --> 00:24:23,462
I'm fine.

299
00:24:23,549 --> 00:24:27,117
I-I'm sorry about running out
on you that way.

300
00:24:27,204 --> 00:24:28,858
After what happened,
I had to leave.

301
00:24:28,945 --> 00:24:31,208
You'd better point yourself
right back here.

302
00:24:31,295 --> 00:24:32,601
The police are looking for you.

303
00:24:32,688 --> 00:24:34,864
They've been breathing
down my neck.

304
00:24:34,951 --> 00:24:37,432
Did they pick up Alan yet? No.

305
00:24:39,347 --> 00:24:41,001
Then I'm not coming back.

306
00:24:41,088 --> 00:24:42,568
They can't make me!

307
00:24:42,655 --> 00:24:45,135
Now you listen to me.

308
00:24:45,222 --> 00:24:47,747
That's all the more reason
why you need police protection.

309
00:24:47,834 --> 00:24:49,879
That hasn't stopped Alan yet.

310
00:24:49,966 --> 00:24:51,577
And if you're thinking about
telling someone where I am,

311
00:24:51,664 --> 00:24:53,404
forget it!

312
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,581
I may not be here for long.

313
00:24:55,668 --> 00:24:57,757
Anyway, I thought
you were my friend.

314
00:24:57,844 --> 00:25:00,542
Now don't blow your cool.
I'm on your side.

315
00:25:00,629 --> 00:25:02,196
You know that.

316
00:25:02,283 --> 00:25:03,893
How're you fixed for money?

317
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:06,635
Oh, I'm alright.
At least until I, uh, get a job.

318
00:25:06,722 --> 00:25:08,942
I'll need a few things.

319
00:25:09,029 --> 00:25:11,422
Lloyd, even forgetting
about Alan,

320
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,642
I can't go back there, not now.

321
00:25:13,729 --> 00:25:15,688
Okay, kid, whatever you say.

322
00:25:15,775 --> 00:25:17,428
I'll tell you what.

323
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:19,343
There's a club in L.A.,
The Losers.

324
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:21,955
Tell Jerry Benton I sent you.

325
00:25:22,042 --> 00:25:25,872
"Jerry Benton."
"The Losers."

326
00:25:25,959 --> 00:25:27,482
Okay. Thanks.

327
00:25:27,569 --> 00:25:29,702
Don't thank me.

328
00:25:29,789 --> 00:25:32,574
I'm not so sure this whole thing
is the right idea.

329
00:25:40,974 --> 00:25:42,497
She gonna stay
in Los Angeles?

330
00:25:42,584 --> 00:25:44,586
You keep your mouth shut.
You understand?

331
00:25:44,673 --> 00:25:46,327
Who, me?
Ha, ha.

332
00:25:46,414 --> 00:25:48,851
Yeah, sure.

333
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:11,178
Whoa!

334
00:26:11,265 --> 00:26:12,919
Whoa.

335
00:26:14,529 --> 00:26:17,271
Great landin',
lady.

336
00:26:17,358 --> 00:26:18,577
Listen, some guys
buy a car,

337
00:26:18,664 --> 00:26:20,970
they think they own
the whole road.

338
00:26:21,057 --> 00:26:24,234
You got a bad tire here, lady.
You got a spare?

339
00:26:24,321 --> 00:26:25,801
I'll have to fix that later.

340
00:26:25,888 --> 00:26:28,848
Is there a, uh,
a Jerry Benton here?

341
00:26:31,111 --> 00:26:32,242
Yeah, inside.

342
00:26:33,766 --> 00:26:35,942
You gonna work here?

343
00:26:36,029 --> 00:26:38,422
Yeah, maybe.

344
00:26:38,509 --> 00:26:40,773
What does a girl have to do
to get a job around here?

345
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:42,513
Far as I know, just dance.

346
00:26:51,218 --> 00:26:53,437
Hey, you alright?

347
00:26:53,524 --> 00:26:55,614
Yeah, I'm just a little nervous,
I guess.

348
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,621
Want a sip of my Coke?

349
00:27:04,579 --> 00:27:05,885
Thanks.

350
00:27:10,585 --> 00:27:12,456
Tell ya what I'm gonna do.

351
00:27:12,543 --> 00:27:15,329
I'm gonna change that tire
for you.

352
00:27:15,416 --> 00:27:16,678
What are you,
one of the good guys?

353
00:27:16,765 --> 00:27:18,854
Fix my tire
and give me a drink.

354
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:26,209
Wish me luck.

355
00:27:26,296 --> 00:27:30,039
Hey, let you smell
my, uh, good luck piece.

356
00:27:30,126 --> 00:27:31,301
Your what?

357
00:27:31,388 --> 00:27:32,389
What? What is it?

358
00:27:32,476 --> 00:27:34,087
Go ahead, smell it .Wait.

359
00:27:34,174 --> 00:27:35,305
It won't hurt ya.

360
00:27:37,525 --> 00:27:38,831
It's rosewood.

361
00:27:40,049 --> 00:27:41,660
I got it down
in Mexico.

362
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:46,186
Hey, don't worry about it.
You're gonna make it.

363
00:27:50,843 --> 00:27:52,322
Down.

364
00:27:52,409 --> 00:27:54,498
That's good.
This one a little bit more.

365
00:27:56,152 --> 00:27:57,371
Yes?

366
00:27:58,981 --> 00:28:00,896
Uh, is Jerry Benton around?

367
00:28:00,983 --> 00:28:02,724
I'm Jerri Benton.

368
00:28:02,811 --> 00:28:04,291
Oh.

369
00:28:04,378 --> 00:28:06,032
You're a woman!

370
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:09,426
Thanks for noticing.
Are you Michele?

371
00:28:09,513 --> 00:28:11,211
Yes.

372
00:28:11,298 --> 00:28:13,735
Come on in.

373
00:28:13,822 --> 00:28:17,521
Lloyd phoned.
He told me about you.

374
00:28:17,608 --> 00:28:18,827
Mm.

375
00:28:18,914 --> 00:28:20,829
It's okay.

376
00:28:20,916 --> 00:28:22,744
Oh, I go back a long way
with Lloyd.

377
00:28:22,831 --> 00:28:24,877
You know he was the greatest
straight man in burlesque?

378
00:28:24,964 --> 00:28:27,618
Ah. Well, he said
you might need a dancer.

379
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:29,185
You do a specialty at his club,
don't you?

380
00:28:29,272 --> 00:28:31,666
Uh-huh. Strobe lights.
Psychedelic, the usual.

381
00:28:31,753 --> 00:28:33,015
I can use that.

382
00:28:33,102 --> 00:28:35,278
Good. Well, would you like me
to audition?

383
00:28:35,365 --> 00:28:36,845
Lloyd says you're great.

384
00:28:36,932 --> 00:28:38,673
And besides,
if you had two left feet,

385
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,588
I'd hire you if he asked me to.

386
00:28:40,675 --> 00:28:42,590
Oh, is that the way
it is with you two?

387
00:28:42,677 --> 00:28:45,419
Us?
We're too tired for romance.

388
00:28:46,942 --> 00:28:48,901
Well, uh, why don't you drop
around tonight

389
00:28:48,988 --> 00:28:50,816
and catch the show
and you can set up your routine

390
00:28:50,903 --> 00:28:51,642
for tomorrow night.

391
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:52,643
Right.

392
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,080
Good, thanks.

393
00:28:57,605 --> 00:28:59,302
Okay, Harry,
let's get this one.

394
00:29:32,074 --> 00:29:33,380
Fred! Did you...?

395
00:29:34,555 --> 00:29:36,209
You uptight, Sailor?

396
00:29:36,296 --> 00:29:39,952
Hey, Alan. Oh, hey. Every cop
in town's after you, man.

397
00:29:40,039 --> 00:29:41,431
Yeah, but you won't yell "cop"

398
00:29:41,518 --> 00:29:43,825
because that'd blow your fix
from Freddy.

399
00:29:43,912 --> 00:29:45,305
Hey, Alan, please get the hell
away from me, huh?

400
00:29:45,392 --> 00:29:46,959
Where's Michele?How would I know?

401
00:29:47,046 --> 00:29:48,917
Because you know everything
that happens in this joint.

402
00:29:49,004 --> 00:29:50,658
Please go away.

403
00:29:50,745 --> 00:29:55,532
Look, I killed three people,
so what's a faggot junkie?

404
00:29:55,619 --> 00:29:57,708
Tell me where she is!

405
00:29:57,796 --> 00:30:02,235
She... Oh, she's
in Los Angeles.

406
00:30:02,322 --> 00:30:04,498
Go away.Where in Los Angeles?

407
00:30:06,587 --> 00:30:09,155
He told her
to try the Losers Club.

408
00:30:23,299 --> 00:30:27,782
# I'm afraid of you
I'm afraid of me

409
00:30:27,869 --> 00:30:32,700
# 'Cause if we get together
There's gonna be a powwow

410
00:30:32,787 --> 00:30:35,398
# Powwow

411
00:30:35,485 --> 00:30:39,098
# PowwowCHORUS: Powwow

412
00:30:39,185 --> 00:30:43,276
# Like two little kids
In a candy store

413
00:30:43,363 --> 00:30:47,323
# We like each other
We don't want any more

414
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:51,327
# Than PowwowCHORUS: Powwow

415
00:30:51,414 --> 00:30:53,721
# PowwowCHORUS: Powwow

416
00:30:55,723 --> 00:30:59,553
# The day is comin', baby

417
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:03,339
# 'Cause I knew
The day you fell

418
00:31:03,426 --> 00:31:06,995
# The best things
that we ever said

419
00:31:07,082 --> 00:31:09,302
# Was "Goodbye, babe"

420
00:31:09,389 --> 00:31:11,521
# Goodbye

421
00:31:11,608 --> 00:31:15,395
# I'm leaving before you
Can fly

422
00:31:15,482 --> 00:31:17,266
I've got to admit,
it takes a lot of work

423
00:31:17,353 --> 00:31:17,963
to run
a place like this.

424
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:19,703
Nothing to it.

425
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:22,010
All it takes is blood, sweat,
tears and money.

426
00:31:22,097 --> 00:31:24,143
Ah. Is she one
of the regulars?

427
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:27,059
Yes. You'll like Tora.
She's very friendly.

428
00:31:27,146 --> 00:31:29,278
Well, I just really came by
to check with your operator

429
00:31:29,365 --> 00:31:31,063
about my lighting.Oh, good idea.

430
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:32,499
I'd better go
over my music too

431
00:31:32,586 --> 00:31:34,457
if I'm going to be ready
for tomorrow night.

432
00:31:34,544 --> 00:31:37,373
Michele, you know, there's
no pressure about your starting.

433
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:38,505
If you're feeling uptight,
you can--

434
00:31:38,592 --> 00:31:40,637
Oh, no, the sooner
the better.

435
00:31:40,724 --> 00:31:43,640
# Oh, babyCHORUS: Yeah

436
00:31:43,727 --> 00:31:45,773
# Oh, baby, baby, baby
C'mon now

437
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:46,992
# Yeah

438
00:32:09,318 --> 00:32:10,580
Hi.Hi.

439
00:32:10,667 --> 00:32:12,843
Got your car ready.

440
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:15,934
I've decided to, uh,
take the night off.

441
00:32:18,414 --> 00:32:19,372
Yeah.

442
00:32:19,459 --> 00:32:21,417
Anything wrong?

443
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:22,679
No. I'm fine.

444
00:32:27,467 --> 00:32:28,685
Okay.

445
00:32:30,992 --> 00:32:33,603
I'm sorry, Joe. I didn't mean
to brush you off.

446
00:32:40,697 --> 00:32:42,308
That's okay.

447
00:32:42,395 --> 00:32:45,311
Which way you going?

448
00:32:45,398 --> 00:32:47,226
Vermont and Beverly.

449
00:32:47,313 --> 00:32:48,836
Mind giving me a lift?

450
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:52,666
You go, uh, pretty close
to my place.

451
00:32:55,364 --> 00:32:57,062
Okay, get in.

452
00:32:57,149 --> 00:32:58,846
You don't mind if I drive,
do you?

453
00:32:58,933 --> 00:33:00,543
What? Are you afraid
of women drivers?

454
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:02,110
Well, I saw the way
that you came

455
00:33:02,197 --> 00:33:04,504
in here this afternoon,
and I'll be safer drivin'.

456
00:33:05,809 --> 00:33:06,897
Alright.

457
00:33:09,944 --> 00:33:11,337
Don't you have a car
of your own?

458
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:13,034
No, not right now.

459
00:33:15,863 --> 00:33:17,212
Want some gum?

460
00:33:17,299 --> 00:33:18,257
No, thanks.

461
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:23,349
Well, before I, uh, start
this little buggy up,

462
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:26,656
do you have
to go right home?

463
00:33:28,397 --> 00:33:30,921
Why?

464
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:33,011
Well, I thought maybe
we could take a ride.

465
00:33:35,752 --> 00:33:36,971
Maybe get a drink.

466
00:33:38,146 --> 00:33:39,713
Okay, I could use
a drink.

467
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:44,979
I got some good Scotch
at my place.

468
00:33:45,066 --> 00:33:46,763
Uh-uh. I'm not
that thirsty!

469
00:33:50,245 --> 00:33:52,421
What if I bring it
out to you?

470
00:33:52,508 --> 00:33:53,857
You do that.

471
00:34:41,427 --> 00:34:44,343
It sure is somethin' to see.

472
00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:45,431
Mm-mm.

473
00:34:47,172 --> 00:34:49,261
It's better from up here
than down close.

474
00:34:53,874 --> 00:34:54,875
Would you like
another drink?

475
00:34:54,962 --> 00:34:56,181
No, thanks.

476
00:35:01,273 --> 00:35:03,013
It gets cold up here
at night.

477
00:35:05,407 --> 00:35:07,496
I'm sorry. I should
have given you my coat.

478
00:35:13,807 --> 00:35:17,550
Mm. Oh,
lovely, thanks.

479
00:35:17,637 --> 00:35:19,682
Here you go.

480
00:35:32,695 --> 00:35:34,654
I bet you bring a lot of girls
up here, don't you?

481
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,572
Be kind of a long walk,
wouldn't it?

482
00:35:39,659 --> 00:35:41,791
Yeah.

483
00:35:41,878 --> 00:35:43,271
I forgot about your car.

484
00:35:45,055 --> 00:35:46,927
I wanna tell you something.

485
00:35:47,014 --> 00:35:50,365
If anything should happen to me,
you can have my car.

486
00:35:50,452 --> 00:35:51,801
Now, what's gonna happen
to you?

487
00:35:53,107 --> 00:35:55,762
I don't know,
but if something does,

488
00:35:55,849 --> 00:35:58,199
I'd like you to have it.

489
00:35:58,286 --> 00:36:00,506
I mean, I can't think of anybody
else I'd rather give it to.

490
00:36:00,593 --> 00:36:02,072
You might as well
have it.

491
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,422
You mean to say you'd just give
me your car, huh?

492
00:36:03,509 --> 00:36:04,901
Sure, why not?

493
00:36:07,252 --> 00:36:08,166
What about your folks?

494
00:36:10,777 --> 00:36:12,909
Look, as far as I'm concerned,
I don't have any folks.

495
00:36:12,996 --> 00:36:14,563
To hell with my folks!

496
00:36:18,785 --> 00:36:20,090
I'm sorry.

497
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:29,187
You don't really mean
to hell with them, do ya?

498
00:36:29,274 --> 00:36:31,014
Look, you don't even know me.

499
00:36:31,101 --> 00:36:34,104
You don't know my folks, so
don't tell me what I mean, okay?

500
00:36:35,715 --> 00:36:37,543
If you really meant
to hell with them,

501
00:36:41,155 --> 00:36:42,635
well, you wouldn't get
so upset.

502
00:36:45,246 --> 00:36:47,640
Yeah.

503
00:36:47,727 --> 00:36:49,946
What are you? Some kind
of psychologist or something?

504
00:37:03,133 --> 00:37:04,396
You wanna go?

505
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:08,008
Yeah, why not?

506
00:37:08,095 --> 00:37:10,576
Come here.

507
00:37:10,663 --> 00:37:12,012
I'm sorry.

508
00:37:17,191 --> 00:37:18,236
Do you want to go?

509
00:37:19,889 --> 00:37:21,239
You know I don't.

510
00:37:55,708 --> 00:37:57,492
You had some sleep.

511
00:37:57,579 --> 00:37:59,277
Yeah. Yeah.

512
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:03,455
How much further
do you go?

513
00:38:03,542 --> 00:38:07,023
About 15 miles.
I turn off at Brookside Road.

514
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:09,635
You can get a lift
at the junction,

515
00:38:09,722 --> 00:38:13,595
a few miles beyond that.Yeah, sure.

516
00:38:13,682 --> 00:38:18,383
I'd take you all the way, but
my wife worries when I'm late.

517
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:21,647
Thirty-two years married,
and she still waits up for me.

518
00:38:23,605 --> 00:38:24,998
That's very nice.

519
00:38:28,958 --> 00:38:31,700
Are you a married man?

520
00:38:31,787 --> 00:38:34,181
I was.

521
00:38:35,704 --> 00:38:38,316
Two years ago this June,
it should have been.

522
00:38:38,403 --> 00:38:39,795
It didn't work out.

523
00:38:42,668 --> 00:38:45,279
Well, it started off fine.

524
00:38:48,717 --> 00:38:51,241
I made mistakes. Well,
everybody makes mistakes.

525
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:55,985
But we could've been happy.

526
00:38:56,072 --> 00:38:58,510
But you know
what breaks up marriages:

527
00:38:58,597 --> 00:39:00,033
other people.

528
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:02,252
You, uh,
mean her folks?

529
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:05,473
I mean everybody!

530
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:09,042
Tellin' her crazy things about
me and making her believe 'em.

531
00:39:09,129 --> 00:39:12,611
I tried to be reasonable,
tried not to get bitter.

532
00:39:12,698 --> 00:39:15,309
Perhaps it's not too late
to try again.

533
00:39:15,396 --> 00:39:19,182
Why don't you, uh, make an
effort to appease her and, uh...

534
00:39:19,269 --> 00:39:21,359
try--She's dead.

535
00:39:21,446 --> 00:39:22,795
Just like me.

536
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:27,016
They killed both of us,
the bastards!

537
00:39:27,103 --> 00:39:28,540
They wouldn't let us live.

538
00:39:47,254 --> 00:39:48,864
Why are you stopping?

539
00:39:48,951 --> 00:39:51,476
Oh, I-I just remembered
I promised

540
00:39:51,563 --> 00:39:54,043
to stop at my daughter's,
pick up something.

541
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:58,439
You can get a lift here.
Good luck to ya.

542
00:39:58,526 --> 00:40:00,398
Mr. Willows,
you're lyin' to me.

543
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:47,357
But, son, why are you
treating me like this?

544
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:49,534
I was kind to you.
I did you a favor.

545
00:40:49,621 --> 00:40:51,449
Just keep walkin',
Mr. Willows.

546
00:42:57,444 --> 00:42:59,446
Who is it?

547
00:42:59,533 --> 00:43:00,621
It's Joe.

548
00:43:03,493 --> 00:43:05,887
Oh, Joe.

549
00:43:09,325 --> 00:43:12,372
Oh, I'm so glad it's you.

550
00:43:16,071 --> 00:43:17,595
I was having
this terrible nightmare.

551
00:43:20,162 --> 00:43:21,773
I was just...on a treadmill...

552
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:26,908
getting nowhere, running
and running and Alan was there.

553
00:43:28,388 --> 00:43:29,607
He was always there.

554
00:43:31,478 --> 00:43:33,567
And Nikki.

555
00:43:33,654 --> 00:43:36,048
Michele, look it, listen to me,
will you?

556
00:43:36,135 --> 00:43:39,138
And the, and the bell
was ringing.

557
00:43:39,225 --> 00:43:40,530
Michele.

558
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:44,099
And Alan was there.
He's always there.

559
00:43:44,186 --> 00:43:45,753
He's always there.

560
00:43:47,799 --> 00:43:51,150
He's always there.

561
00:43:51,237 --> 00:43:52,673
After what you told me
last night,

562
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:55,502
I-I knew this is no time
for you to be alone.

563
00:43:58,026 --> 00:43:59,637
You know what I want you to do?

564
00:43:59,724 --> 00:44:01,551
Grab your clothes.

565
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:05,381
Get out of that lousy,
depressing hotel room, and, uh--

566
00:44:06,731 --> 00:44:08,167
--come on over here.

567
00:44:08,254 --> 00:44:11,083
Oh, Joe, you don't understand.

568
00:44:13,476 --> 00:44:17,480
I gotta, I gotta solve
this thing by myself.

569
00:44:17,567 --> 00:44:18,786
It's, it's my problem.

570
00:44:18,873 --> 00:44:20,788
I don't want to drag you
into it.

571
00:44:20,875 --> 00:44:23,399
Hey, will you let me help you?

572
00:44:23,486 --> 00:44:25,010
I'd like to help.

573
00:44:25,097 --> 00:44:27,708
What are you trying to prove?

574
00:44:27,795 --> 00:44:29,144
You can't help.

575
00:44:29,231 --> 00:44:32,017
I don't know.

576
00:44:32,104 --> 00:44:34,584
I wish I knew the answers.

577
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:35,847
Will you come over?

578
00:44:38,545 --> 00:44:40,765
No, I can't.

579
00:44:44,594 --> 00:44:45,726
Alright.

580
00:44:49,034 --> 00:44:54,126
I've been, uh, sittin' around
here thinkin' about last night.

581
00:44:54,213 --> 00:44:55,736
Uh-huh.

582
00:44:57,695 --> 00:44:58,913
It's good, Michele, you know?

583
00:45:02,395 --> 00:45:03,701
Was it, Joe?

584
00:45:28,203 --> 00:45:30,466
Morning, George.Morning.

585
00:45:34,819 --> 00:45:36,516
What have you got?

586
00:45:36,603 --> 00:45:39,475
The body was found there by
the caretaker about an hour ago.

587
00:45:39,562 --> 00:45:41,347
Shot once in the back
of the head.

588
00:45:41,434 --> 00:45:42,870
Any identification?

589
00:45:42,957 --> 00:45:44,480
Whoever shot him
took it all.

590
00:45:44,567 --> 00:45:45,786
Figures.

591
00:45:45,873 --> 00:45:48,658
Except for this
signet ring.

592
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:50,748
Initials J.W. on it.

593
00:45:55,056 --> 00:45:57,145
Just one thing, lieutenant.

594
00:45:57,232 --> 00:45:59,147
There was a 150 left in cash.

595
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:02,368
Which doesn't figure.

596
00:46:02,455 --> 00:46:04,805
That kills the robbery motive.

597
00:46:04,892 --> 00:46:07,503
Ah. What about markings
on the clothing?

598
00:46:07,590 --> 00:46:10,158
The suit was from the local
department store.

599
00:46:10,245 --> 00:46:14,032
I picked up this shell casing.
A nine millimeter.

600
00:46:14,119 --> 00:46:16,948
I think shot
from a P38.

601
00:46:17,035 --> 00:46:19,124
What about the bullet?Still in the victim.

602
00:46:21,648 --> 00:46:23,432
You know, I was just thinking,
that man Morris,

603
00:46:23,519 --> 00:46:25,739
who shot his wife,

604
00:46:25,826 --> 00:46:28,916
he used a P38.

605
00:46:29,003 --> 00:46:30,962
Look, as soon as the coroner
can give you that slug,

606
00:46:31,049 --> 00:46:33,878
have the Firearms Application
check it out.

607
00:46:33,965 --> 00:46:35,705
And see how that
shell casing compares

608
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:37,795
with the one we found
at the Morris shooting.

609
00:46:37,882 --> 00:46:40,188
Strange.What?

610
00:46:40,275 --> 00:46:42,495
Kill a man,
but don't rob him.

611
00:46:42,582 --> 00:46:44,497
Ah, yeah.

612
00:47:42,294 --> 00:47:43,425
Alright!

613
00:47:51,738 --> 00:47:53,044
So I changed
my mind.

614
00:47:54,523 --> 00:47:55,960
Come on in.

615
00:47:56,047 --> 00:47:57,570
Oh.

616
00:47:58,788 --> 00:48:00,051
Thanks.

617
00:48:05,404 --> 00:48:06,927
I'll hang these up
for you.

618
00:48:07,014 --> 00:48:08,146
Okay.

619
00:48:20,201 --> 00:48:21,855
Want some coffee?

620
00:48:21,942 --> 00:48:23,117
Yes, thanks.

621
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:27,295
You go ahead
and make yourself at home.

622
00:48:27,382 --> 00:48:28,557
Okay.

623
00:48:33,519 --> 00:48:36,261
Would you rather have a beer?Oh, whatever.

624
00:48:36,348 --> 00:48:37,610
Coffee's fine.

625
00:48:45,009 --> 00:48:47,185
Can I help.No, it's alright.

626
00:48:47,272 --> 00:48:48,708
I hope you
don't mind instant.

627
00:48:48,795 --> 00:48:50,318
No.
That's lovely.

628
00:48:57,108 --> 00:48:58,631
Aren't you a little big
for toys?

629
00:49:00,633 --> 00:49:02,113
For your information,
that's no toy.

630
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:04,506
That thing is,
uh, gonna fly.

631
00:49:04,593 --> 00:49:06,856
Mm-mm.
In the air?

632
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:08,119
Like a bird.

633
00:49:08,206 --> 00:49:10,425
Around in circles, that is.

634
00:49:10,512 --> 00:49:11,949
It's gonna fly.
Do you wanna see how it works?

635
00:49:12,036 --> 00:49:13,167
Yeah, I'd love to.

636
00:49:16,388 --> 00:49:21,262
This is, uh,
the igniter.

637
00:49:21,349 --> 00:49:23,351
Would you hold
this little nozzle for me--

638
00:49:23,438 --> 00:49:27,007
--because, uh, to, just to put
the gas in this one point?

639
00:49:29,488 --> 00:49:30,619
Right there.

640
00:49:41,021 --> 00:49:42,327
It works.

641
00:49:52,032 --> 00:49:53,816
What about
your neighbors?

642
00:49:55,166 --> 00:49:57,429
Yeah, they get mad at me
sometimes.

643
00:49:57,516 --> 00:49:58,647
I wonder why.

644
00:50:00,606 --> 00:50:04,436
Sometimes at night, you know,
I get up on top of the roof.

645
00:50:04,523 --> 00:50:06,133
Oh, boy, I'd fly
that thing around.

646
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:07,700
You should hear
the neighbors then.

647
00:50:11,791 --> 00:50:14,011
You want cream and sugar?

648
00:50:14,098 --> 00:50:15,229
Black's fine.

649
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:22,410
Like I said, you just do
whatever you want, you know?

650
00:50:22,497 --> 00:50:23,803
Make yourself at home.

651
00:50:23,890 --> 00:50:25,022
Thanks.

652
00:50:36,642 --> 00:50:38,035
I like your place, Joe.

653
00:50:38,122 --> 00:50:39,906
Thank you.

654
00:50:43,910 --> 00:50:45,216
What, are you hung up
on bullfights?

655
00:50:45,303 --> 00:50:46,739
Mm-mm.

656
00:50:46,826 --> 00:50:49,698
No. I used to be
when I was in high school.

657
00:50:49,785 --> 00:50:52,571
Now, why would anyone
want to be a bullfighter?

658
00:50:52,658 --> 00:50:54,094
Money.

659
00:50:54,181 --> 00:50:55,661
Yeah.

660
00:50:55,748 --> 00:50:57,706
I once, uh, read a quote.

661
00:50:57,793 --> 00:51:00,927
It said that, "Hunger wounds
worse than the kill."

662
00:51:02,537 --> 00:51:05,236
Uh, could we just
turn off the set before--?

663
00:51:05,323 --> 00:51:07,673
I'd like not-- I don't really
want to see the kill.

664
00:51:13,722 --> 00:51:15,898
These are nice.
You like photography, huh?

665
00:51:18,118 --> 00:51:19,815
Yeah. I kind of
fool around with it.

666
00:51:22,253 --> 00:51:23,428
Hey.

667
00:51:24,777 --> 00:51:26,561
Oh, come on, now.

668
00:51:26,648 --> 00:51:29,086
Go-- Stop.Hey, you got a pretty face.

669
00:51:29,173 --> 00:51:30,609
No, please.

670
00:51:34,003 --> 00:51:36,049
Oh, this here,
this is my old man right here.

671
00:51:36,136 --> 00:51:37,703
The one in the middle.This one.

672
00:51:37,790 --> 00:51:42,055
Yeah. And this is my uncle,
my other uncle, his brothers

673
00:51:42,142 --> 00:51:44,231
and my grandmother,
who's 96 years old,

674
00:51:44,318 --> 00:51:45,711
lives in Oregon
and is still kicking around.

675
00:51:45,798 --> 00:51:48,148
And her sister.

676
00:51:48,235 --> 00:51:49,715
Her sister's a beauty,
isn't she?

677
00:51:49,802 --> 00:51:52,370
Yeah--

678
00:51:52,457 --> 00:51:54,154
God, they're dressed funny.

679
00:51:56,722 --> 00:51:58,593
Emiliano Zapata.

680
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:01,074
Yeah. The revolutionist.

681
00:52:01,161 --> 00:52:04,512
He's a pretty strong-looking
guy, isn't he?

682
00:52:04,599 --> 00:52:05,731
Yes, he is.

683
00:52:07,907 --> 00:52:09,822
Kind of reminds me
of my father a little.

684
00:52:09,909 --> 00:52:11,258
Oh, yeah?
Mm-hm.

685
00:52:11,345 --> 00:52:13,304
Just a bit
around the eyes.

686
00:52:16,524 --> 00:52:18,874
Hey, you want, uh--
You want some music?

687
00:52:18,961 --> 00:52:20,137
Yes. Lovely.

688
00:52:25,751 --> 00:52:27,056
Go ahead, sit down.

689
00:52:27,144 --> 00:52:28,928
Okay.

690
00:52:29,015 --> 00:52:30,364
Whew!

691
00:52:30,451 --> 00:52:32,323
What about
your old man?

692
00:52:32,410 --> 00:52:33,715
Oh, not much, really.

693
00:52:33,802 --> 00:52:35,935
My mother kicked him
out of the house.

694
00:52:36,022 --> 00:52:38,894
I was only 8 years old
when he left.

695
00:52:38,981 --> 00:52:41,245
My mother just kept
chipping away at him.

696
00:52:41,332 --> 00:52:43,116
He never got a break.

697
00:52:43,203 --> 00:52:45,640
Can't blame him much.

698
00:52:45,727 --> 00:52:47,251
Sometimes I think
maybe he's tied up

699
00:52:47,338 --> 00:52:49,296
with what I've been
looking for.

700
00:52:49,383 --> 00:52:51,472
Well, we're all looking
for something, aren't we?

701
00:52:51,559 --> 00:52:52,691
Yeah.

702
00:52:55,389 --> 00:52:56,956
I hope you're going
to like it here.

703
00:52:58,697 --> 00:53:00,438
You know what
you ought to do?

704
00:53:00,525 --> 00:53:04,746
Just-- Just take your mind
off everything, if you can.

705
00:53:08,576 --> 00:53:11,623
I'm sorry. I guess I've been
kind of a drag.

706
00:53:11,710 --> 00:53:13,494
Hey. Now you see?
There you go again.

707
00:53:13,581 --> 00:53:15,409
You're not a drag.

708
00:53:15,496 --> 00:53:16,758
You like the beach?

709
00:53:16,845 --> 00:53:18,195
Yes, I do. I love it.

710
00:53:18,282 --> 00:53:19,674
We got fantastic beaches
around here.

711
00:53:19,761 --> 00:53:21,850
I got a day off tomorrow.
We'll go, alright?

712
00:53:21,937 --> 00:53:24,853
Great. Well, I've got my car.

713
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:26,812
Now, that reminds me.

714
00:53:26,899 --> 00:53:28,901
You were gonna tell me
about your car.

715
00:53:30,729 --> 00:53:32,078
A friend of mine,
he got in a jam.

716
00:53:32,165 --> 00:53:33,340
That's all.

717
00:53:33,427 --> 00:53:36,343
No.
Now, why--

718
00:53:36,430 --> 00:53:37,605
You know,
you talk too much.

719
00:53:37,692 --> 00:53:39,041
Mm! Mm!

720
00:53:52,533 --> 00:53:55,841
Now, this slug was taken
from the Morris woman.

721
00:53:55,928 --> 00:53:58,017
And this one came from
the Willows body.

722
00:54:01,934 --> 00:54:03,065
Take a look, lieutenant.

723
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:09,942
Now as you can see,
the general characteristics

724
00:54:10,029 --> 00:54:12,466
and the fine striations
match up.

725
00:54:12,553 --> 00:54:14,729
There's no doubt that they came
from the same gun.

726
00:54:14,816 --> 00:54:16,557
The same goes
for the shell casings.

727
00:54:16,644 --> 00:54:18,298
The break we needed.

728
00:54:22,868 --> 00:54:24,652
Communications.

729
00:54:24,739 --> 00:54:27,568
This is Manion speaking.
I want an APB.

730
00:54:27,655 --> 00:54:29,918
Investigation by the Clark
County Sheriff's Department

731
00:54:30,005 --> 00:54:32,269
confirms the fact that bullets
which killed Nikki Morris

732
00:54:32,356 --> 00:54:34,227
came from the same gun
that killed victim

733
00:54:34,314 --> 00:54:38,100
now identified by this
department as Arthur Willows.

734
00:54:38,187 --> 00:54:40,146
Alan Morris is now believed
in possession

735
00:54:40,233 --> 00:54:43,323
of a 1969 black over white
Plymouth sedan,

736
00:54:43,410 --> 00:54:46,979
Nevada license C-5-8-6-8-5.

737
00:54:47,066 --> 00:54:50,069
Subject is armed
and extremely dangerous.

738
00:54:50,156 --> 00:54:51,288
Right.

739
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:54,682
Oh!
Come on.

740
00:54:54,769 --> 00:54:57,163
I stole some chicken,
got some Cokes.

741
00:54:57,250 --> 00:54:59,078
I'll drive.Oh, no, no, no.

742
00:54:59,165 --> 00:55:01,254
I'm fine.
Come on, get in.

743
00:55:01,341 --> 00:55:02,516
Let me in first.

744
00:55:02,603 --> 00:55:04,823
You stepped
on my foot.

745
00:55:04,910 --> 00:55:06,128
You want to go
straight home?

746
00:55:06,215 --> 00:55:07,565
Yeah, straight home.

747
00:55:07,652 --> 00:55:08,783
Give me a kiss.

748
00:55:18,793 --> 00:55:19,968
Whoo!

749
00:57:17,782 --> 00:57:19,392
Catch.
Ooh!

750
00:58:13,185 --> 00:58:16,275
Come on, get your feet wet.
Go on, get in there.

751
00:58:16,362 --> 00:58:17,537
Yahoo!

752
00:58:17,624 --> 00:58:19,191
Oh!

753
00:58:20,540 --> 00:58:21,802
Oh!

754
00:58:26,590 --> 00:58:27,808
Whoa! Whoa, Joe.

755
00:58:35,337 --> 00:58:36,643
Whoa, whoa!

756
00:58:44,782 --> 00:58:46,958
Joe, where you going?
Now, where are you--? Joe.

757
00:58:51,049 --> 00:58:52,224
Come on!

758
00:58:52,311 --> 00:58:54,313
Come on.
Oh!

759
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,054
Come on over here.

760
00:58:56,141 --> 00:58:57,403
Whoa!
Joe!

761
00:59:11,112 --> 00:59:13,071
Oh! Oh!

762
00:59:15,943 --> 00:59:17,858
Ah!

763
00:59:19,381 --> 00:59:21,993
Oh, oh, oh!
Oh, no!

764
00:59:27,825 --> 00:59:28,956
Whew!

765
00:59:33,265 --> 00:59:34,440
Whew!

766
00:59:45,669 --> 00:59:47,366
I think we got
something going.

767
00:59:49,716 --> 00:59:51,849
Yeah, something good.

768
00:59:53,502 --> 00:59:55,374
Oh, it's funny.

769
00:59:55,461 --> 00:59:59,900
I guess I never really cared
about anyone up until now.

770
00:59:59,987 --> 01:00:03,730
With me it was always just one
of those things, you know?

771
01:00:03,817 --> 01:00:04,949
Yeah.

772
01:00:07,995 --> 01:00:10,824
It kind of scares me
a little.

773
01:00:10,911 --> 01:00:14,480
Before, I could always
stay or go.

774
01:00:14,567 --> 01:00:16,656
It didn't matter much
one way or the other.

775
01:00:26,231 --> 01:00:28,581
It sure matters to me
what you do.

776
01:00:34,108 --> 01:00:35,719
Does it, Joe?

777
01:00:35,806 --> 01:00:36,937
Mmm.

778
01:00:43,509 --> 01:00:45,206
It's lonely having nobody.

779
01:00:48,862 --> 01:00:51,430
Could I ask you
a question, Joe?

780
01:00:51,517 --> 01:00:52,779
Sure.

781
01:00:55,129 --> 01:00:57,436
If I did decide to leave...

782
01:01:00,831 --> 01:01:03,050
would you want
to go with me?

783
01:01:03,137 --> 01:01:05,836
I mean, just pick up
and leave everything behind.

784
01:01:07,272 --> 01:01:08,882
You mean just cut out?

785
01:01:08,969 --> 01:01:10,101
Yeah.

786
01:01:12,973 --> 01:01:16,107
Like, uh, right now?

787
01:01:16,194 --> 01:01:17,586
Like tomorrow?

788
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:18,805
Yeah.

789
01:01:29,381 --> 01:01:30,904
Yeah.

790
01:01:34,778 --> 01:01:36,301
Yeah, I would.

791
01:03:11,178 --> 01:03:13,833
Ventura 8724.

792
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:16,140
Am at Leo Carrillo
State Beach.

793
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:24,626
Request backup assistance.

794
01:03:27,281 --> 01:03:29,022
Ten-four.

795
01:03:29,109 --> 01:03:31,764
All units in beach areas
16 and 22.

796
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:39,990
Clark County suspect in view.
Armed and extremely dangerous.

797
01:05:06,554 --> 01:05:07,904
Alan's score
is four now.

798
01:05:07,991 --> 01:05:11,342
The latest victim's car
was found in L.A. today.

799
01:05:11,429 --> 01:05:13,170
Do you know
if Michele is there?

800
01:05:13,257 --> 01:05:14,388
How would I know?

801
01:05:15,563 --> 01:05:17,957
Come here.

802
01:05:18,044 --> 01:05:21,047
Sailor, we haven't got
a lot of time.

803
01:05:21,134 --> 01:05:23,006
Do you know if Lloyd
has heard from her?

804
01:05:23,093 --> 01:05:24,921
So help, me, lieutenant,
I don't know.

805
01:05:27,445 --> 01:05:29,664
What time will Lloyd
be back?

806
01:05:29,751 --> 01:05:31,144
He didn't say.

807
01:05:31,231 --> 01:05:34,234
Did you try his house?Yeah.

808
01:05:34,321 --> 01:05:36,584
Then I don't know any other
number to call for him.

809
01:05:42,547 --> 01:05:44,331
Are any
of the other girls in?

810
01:05:44,418 --> 01:05:47,160
Jackie's in the dressing room.
The others haven't come in yet.

811
01:05:47,247 --> 01:05:49,771
Jackie and Michele
were pretty good friends?

812
01:05:49,858 --> 01:05:51,948
We're all
Michele's friends.

813
01:05:53,340 --> 01:05:54,602
Mm-hm.

814
01:05:56,735 --> 01:05:59,564
Alan's in L.A., huh?

815
01:05:59,651 --> 01:06:02,480
They just found a car there,
that's all.

816
01:06:02,567 --> 01:06:06,397
We were both here when someone
called Lloyd from Los Angeles.

817
01:06:07,746 --> 01:06:09,400
Well, I didn't listen.

818
01:06:09,487 --> 01:06:11,184
You always listen.

819
01:06:11,271 --> 01:06:14,057
All girls listen.

820
01:06:14,144 --> 01:06:17,277
Don't give me any of that stuff.
I know about your scene too.

821
01:06:17,364 --> 01:06:22,587
And I know that nice, handsome,
young pusher, Fred.

822
01:06:22,674 --> 01:06:25,546
Keeps you feeling no pain.

823
01:06:25,633 --> 01:06:27,548
I can score for myself.

824
01:06:27,635 --> 01:06:31,335
I talk to the right people,
and in a matter of weeks

825
01:06:31,422 --> 01:06:34,512
you're in a place with
wire screens on the windows.

826
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:37,994
Is that what
you want, Sailor?

827
01:06:40,561 --> 01:06:42,955
Alright, okay.

828
01:06:43,042 --> 01:06:45,566
The call was from
Michele.

829
01:06:45,653 --> 01:06:46,872
He was waiting for me
that night.

830
01:06:46,959 --> 01:06:48,700
He hurt me bad.

831
01:06:48,787 --> 01:06:50,397
He would have
killed me.

832
01:06:52,704 --> 01:06:57,230
Lieutenant, Sailor remembered
some answers.

833
01:07:21,776 --> 01:07:23,256
Hey, where are
you going?

834
01:07:23,343 --> 01:07:24,649
Well, I thought
I'd get some gas.

835
01:07:24,736 --> 01:07:26,825
We're almost out.

836
01:07:26,912 --> 01:07:29,132
Okay, well, listen, I'll meet
you down at the gas station.

837
01:07:29,219 --> 01:07:31,308
Okay. Oh, listen,
I've got some money.

838
01:07:31,395 --> 01:07:33,397
Go on, take it.Okay.

839
01:07:35,703 --> 01:07:37,053
Hey, Joe.

840
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:40,926
Thanks for a nice day.

841
01:07:41,013 --> 01:07:42,145
Sure.

842
01:07:51,980 --> 01:07:53,765
Oh, would you check under
the hood too, please?

843
01:07:53,852 --> 01:07:55,027
Oh, sure.

844
01:08:04,036 --> 01:08:06,256
Uh, where's
the oil jigger?

845
01:08:15,613 --> 01:08:16,831
Foreign, you know.

846
01:08:18,485 --> 01:08:19,704
You know,
a lot of my customers

847
01:08:19,791 --> 01:08:20,487
work at the hospital
down the street.

848
01:08:20,574 --> 01:08:22,272
Uh-huh.
Oh, yeah.

849
01:08:22,359 --> 01:08:24,796
I'd say fully 60 percent
of them are hospital employees.

850
01:08:24,883 --> 01:08:26,406
You don't say.
Yeah.

851
01:08:26,493 --> 01:08:29,061
You, uh-- You work
at the hospital?

852
01:08:29,148 --> 01:08:30,802
Yeah, sure.
I'm a brain surgeon.

853
01:08:32,717 --> 01:08:34,501
Uh, excuse me
for a minute.

854
01:08:39,985 --> 01:08:41,769
Hello?

855
01:08:41,856 --> 01:08:43,815
Who?

856
01:08:43,902 --> 01:08:47,558
Oh, uh, yeah.
Just a minute. I'll see.

857
01:08:47,645 --> 01:08:49,734
Hey, Miss,
is your name Michele?

858
01:08:49,821 --> 01:08:51,649
Yes.

859
01:08:51,736 --> 01:08:53,172
Phone's for you.

860
01:08:59,135 --> 01:09:00,353
Thanks.
Yeah.

861
01:09:02,703 --> 01:09:04,618
Joe?

862
01:09:04,705 --> 01:09:07,795
No, not Joe, Michele.
Alan.

863
01:09:07,882 --> 01:09:10,668
You must've had a nice time
at the beach today.

864
01:09:10,755 --> 01:09:13,149
Well, I used to take Nikki
to the beach.

865
01:09:14,498 --> 01:09:16,369
You crazy, sick...

866
01:09:16,456 --> 01:09:19,720
Look, I'll admit I'm not
an asset to society,

867
01:09:19,807 --> 01:09:23,028
but you made me kill the only
thing I ever loved, you know?

868
01:09:26,727 --> 01:09:28,990
So let's make a deal,
you and me.

869
01:09:29,077 --> 01:09:31,254
I'll get rid
of the three of us.

870
01:09:31,341 --> 01:09:34,431
You, me and your boyfriend.

871
01:09:34,518 --> 01:09:37,173
I sort of planned it
that way anyhow, you know?

872
01:09:38,783 --> 01:09:40,045
Michele?

873
01:09:56,975 --> 01:09:58,890
Hey! Hey, lady!

874
01:16:07,519 --> 01:16:09,042
What are you doing out here?

875
01:16:52,477 --> 01:16:54,044
Joe.

876
01:16:54,131 --> 01:16:55,959
Oh...

877
01:16:56,046 --> 01:16:58,135
I'm right here,
I'm right here.

878
01:16:58,222 --> 01:16:59,658
Oh, my God.

879
01:17:09,450 --> 01:17:11,148
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to scare you.

880
01:17:14,107 --> 01:17:15,500
Is...

881
01:17:20,244 --> 01:17:21,637
Where is this?

882
01:17:21,724 --> 01:17:24,770
This is an emergency hospital.
I'm Dr. Connors.

883
01:17:31,603 --> 01:17:34,258
Oh, wow.

884
01:17:36,434 --> 01:17:38,131
He was after me
in the park.

885
01:17:38,218 --> 01:17:40,960
We know, Michele.
You told us.

886
01:17:41,047 --> 01:17:42,745
I don't remember that.

887
01:17:47,445 --> 01:17:48,707
How did you get here?

888
01:17:48,794 --> 01:17:50,448
On a plane.

889
01:17:50,535 --> 01:17:53,320
Did you get Alan?We will.

890
01:17:53,407 --> 01:17:55,888
We've covered every airport,
bus terminal, railroad station.

891
01:17:55,975 --> 01:17:57,760
There are roadblocks
on all main arteries,

892
01:17:57,847 --> 01:18:00,066
as well as the radio
and television coverage.

893
01:18:00,153 --> 01:18:03,591
This is Lieutenant Harrison of
Los Angeles Homicide, Michele.

894
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:05,855
Now, he's stationed a patrolman
just outside your door

895
01:18:05,942 --> 01:18:07,117
for your safety.

896
01:18:10,729 --> 01:18:13,166
Doctor, may I have
a talk with her now?

897
01:18:13,253 --> 01:18:14,733
Yes, but please be brief.

898
01:18:14,820 --> 01:18:16,474
Could I...

899
01:18:16,561 --> 01:18:18,911
Could I just talk
with Joe a minute, please?

900
01:18:21,784 --> 01:18:23,350
Okay, but just for a minute.

901
01:18:47,200 --> 01:18:51,335
The guy at the gas station
told me about the phone call.

902
01:18:51,422 --> 01:18:55,426
And I waited and waited for you
to show up at work.

903
01:18:55,513 --> 01:18:59,256
I thought someone pulled a rug
out from under me.

904
01:19:01,693 --> 01:19:04,174
Joe, um...

905
01:19:06,916 --> 01:19:09,440
remember, um...

906
01:19:09,527 --> 01:19:11,311
what you promised me
at the beach?

907
01:19:13,661 --> 01:19:16,708
You mean about cutting out?

908
01:19:16,795 --> 01:19:18,579
Yeah.

909
01:19:18,666 --> 01:19:20,756
I just thought that maybe
we'd go to Mexico.

910
01:19:22,235 --> 01:19:25,151
There are beaches there,
and bullfights.

911
01:19:25,238 --> 01:19:26,544
Shh.

912
01:19:29,329 --> 01:19:31,984
No, really, I...

913
01:19:32,071 --> 01:19:34,378
We could go tomorrow.

914
01:19:34,465 --> 01:19:36,989
We could just, uh,
get in the car and split

915
01:19:37,076 --> 01:19:38,338
just the two of us.

916
01:19:38,425 --> 01:19:41,037
How does that sound?Sure.

917
01:19:41,124 --> 01:19:42,255
Sounds great.

918
01:19:46,129 --> 01:19:47,434
It should be great.

919
01:19:51,787 --> 01:19:52,918
Joe...

920
01:19:57,749 --> 01:19:59,142
do you really
mean it?

921
01:20:00,926 --> 01:20:02,101
Yeah.

922
01:20:05,931 --> 01:20:07,063
Mr. Brodnek?

923
01:20:18,335 --> 01:20:20,032
Tomorrow.

924
01:20:37,310 --> 01:20:39,530
Doctor, how soon do you think
I can take Michele

925
01:20:39,617 --> 01:20:40,966
back to Las Vegas?

926
01:20:41,053 --> 01:20:43,751
Possibly by this afternoon.

927
01:20:43,839 --> 01:20:45,841
Oh, I'm not going back
to Las Vegas.

928
01:20:45,928 --> 01:20:47,755
I'm sorry, Michele,
but it's gotta be total

929
01:20:47,843 --> 01:20:51,585
police custody for you until
we've got Alan Morris locked up.

930
01:20:51,672 --> 01:20:53,849
I am not going back
to Las Vegas.

931
01:20:53,936 --> 01:20:55,938
In that case, you'll be given
police protection here

932
01:20:56,025 --> 01:21:00,290
until you can be extradited
as a material witness.

933
01:21:00,377 --> 01:21:02,292
Doctor, please,
tell them to get out of here.

934
01:21:02,379 --> 01:21:04,729
Gentlemen, please.

935
01:21:04,816 --> 01:21:06,992
Everything's gonna be alright.
Just trust us.

936
01:21:09,560 --> 01:21:11,388
I want you to try
and get yourself some sleep.

937
01:22:26,767 --> 01:22:28,117
Thanks a lot.
Keep the change.

938
01:23:02,238 --> 01:23:04,718
Not a sound.

939
01:23:07,112 --> 01:23:10,420
You know, this is even better
than I expected.

940
01:23:10,507 --> 01:23:12,509
I was waiting here for Joe.

941
01:23:29,656 --> 01:23:31,006
What do you...?

942
01:23:32,659 --> 01:23:35,053
What do you want
with Joe?

943
01:23:35,140 --> 01:23:38,317
I'm gonna kill him,
just like you killed Nikki.

944
01:23:38,404 --> 01:23:42,365
You really are sick,
aren't you?

945
01:23:42,452 --> 01:23:45,977
They ought to lock you up
someplace.

946
01:23:46,064 --> 01:23:49,067
Yeah, I'm touched
by your concern.

947
01:23:51,113 --> 01:23:52,288
No! No!

948
01:23:53,637 --> 01:23:55,117
Yeah, I know what
you're thinking.

949
01:23:55,204 --> 01:23:56,596
You're thinking you'll get
somebody up here.

950
01:23:56,683 --> 01:23:58,642
But I can kill you
before they even get here,

951
01:23:58,729 --> 01:24:00,209
and then wait for Joe, huh?

952
01:24:13,657 --> 01:24:16,094
Officer...

953
01:24:16,181 --> 01:24:17,922
Two seventy-five.

954
01:24:20,838 --> 01:24:22,361
Jerri, I'm gonna split.

955
01:24:22,448 --> 01:24:24,276
You going back
to the hospital now, Joe?

956
01:24:24,363 --> 01:24:26,931
No, no, they want her
to get some rest.

957
01:24:27,018 --> 01:24:29,281
Go home. You look beat.
Jack can help me close up.

958
01:24:29,368 --> 01:24:31,327
Yeah, I'll see you.

959
01:24:31,414 --> 01:24:33,329
Five fifty-five.

960
01:24:50,172 --> 01:24:52,783
I could use
a drink of water.

961
01:24:52,870 --> 01:24:54,437
Let's go to the kitchen.

962
01:25:21,899 --> 01:25:24,162
You were gonna stick that
right in me, weren't you?

963
01:25:28,297 --> 01:25:30,255
Mind if I get
my water now?

964
01:25:39,264 --> 01:25:40,570
How much longer?

965
01:25:40,657 --> 01:25:43,573
How much longer are you gonna
keep it up?

966
01:25:43,660 --> 01:25:45,575
2:15 now.

967
01:25:45,662 --> 01:25:49,361
As long as it takes him
to get here.

968
01:25:49,448 --> 01:25:52,408
Why don't you just
get it over with?

969
01:25:52,495 --> 01:25:54,714
That wouldn't be a bit of fun,
now, would it?

970
01:26:05,072 --> 01:26:07,205
Now unless you got
some more bright ideas,

971
01:26:07,292 --> 01:26:08,989
why don't you sit down?

972
01:26:09,076 --> 01:26:10,339
Relax.

973
01:26:16,823 --> 01:26:20,175
You know,
you shouldn't hate me.

974
01:26:20,262 --> 01:26:22,786
Because after all,
I'm not responsible.

975
01:26:22,873 --> 01:26:24,091
I'm sick.

976
01:26:25,267 --> 01:26:27,182
I need help.

977
01:26:27,269 --> 01:26:29,358
You said so yourself.

978
01:26:29,445 --> 01:26:32,796
Yeah, well,
I'll tell them that, Alan?

979
01:26:32,883 --> 01:26:35,799
I'll tell them
it's not your fault.

980
01:26:38,497 --> 01:26:40,804
That's a nice try.

981
01:26:40,891 --> 01:26:42,414
Stall.

982
01:26:42,501 --> 01:26:44,329
But you can't
save Joe from me

983
01:26:44,416 --> 01:26:46,810
any more than I could
save Nikki from you.

984
01:26:46,897 --> 01:26:49,334
Save Nikki from me?

985
01:26:49,421 --> 01:26:54,078
Alan, you killed Nikki.

986
01:26:54,165 --> 01:26:55,340
Get it?

987
01:26:56,733 --> 01:26:58,387
Yeah, I killed her.

988
01:26:58,474 --> 01:27:00,171
I killed her
because of your lies.

989
01:27:00,258 --> 01:27:01,912
Your lies.

990
01:27:01,999 --> 01:27:04,262
And you know something?
You shouldn't be telling lies,

991
01:27:04,349 --> 01:27:07,918
not now, not in the last
few minutes of your life.

992
01:27:12,662 --> 01:27:14,925
We're gonna
wait for Joe.

993
01:27:16,753 --> 01:27:21,192
And I'm gonna kill Joe
while you watch.

994
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:27,372
And then I'm gonna
kill you.

995
01:27:43,606 --> 01:27:45,390
Los Angeles
Police Department.

996
01:27:48,524 --> 01:27:51,701
Los Angeles Police Department.
Detective Newcomb.

997
01:27:51,788 --> 01:27:52,963
What'd we do wrong?

998
01:27:53,050 --> 01:27:54,791
I'm looking for Michele.

999
01:27:54,878 --> 01:27:56,183
She's in the hospital.

1000
01:27:56,271 --> 01:27:58,490
Not anymore.
She slipped out a window.

1001
01:27:58,577 --> 01:28:01,232
Oh, no.
That poor girl.

1002
01:28:01,319 --> 01:28:02,451
We were alerted for someone

1003
01:28:02,538 --> 01:28:04,409
getting in to the hospital,
not out.

1004
01:28:04,496 --> 01:28:06,324
You have any idea
where she might be?

1005
01:28:06,411 --> 01:28:08,631
She's at a hotel. I have her
address in the office.

1006
01:28:08,718 --> 01:28:10,197
Don't, don't.
Don't bother.

1007
01:28:10,285 --> 01:28:12,112
She checked out of there
day before yesterday.

1008
01:28:12,199 --> 01:28:13,984
What about the fellow
who came to the hospital?

1009
01:28:14,071 --> 01:28:15,464
Joe.
Joe.

1010
01:28:15,551 --> 01:28:17,074
He left here
a little while ago.

1011
01:28:17,161 --> 01:28:18,902
Have any idea
where I can reach him?

1012
01:28:18,989 --> 01:28:21,296
Well, I have his phone number
in the office. I'll get it.

1013
01:28:24,734 --> 01:28:26,649
"Fiesta Bravo."

1014
01:28:34,744 --> 01:28:36,615
Hung up on bullfights.

1015
01:28:38,356 --> 01:28:40,010
You gotta be some kind
of a freak

1016
01:28:40,097 --> 01:28:42,142
to like to watch
an animal die.

1017
01:28:44,667 --> 01:28:47,278
Or does it, uh...

1018
01:28:47,365 --> 01:28:49,193
Does it make him
a better lover?

1019
01:28:54,372 --> 01:28:56,548
It didn't help you much,
did it?

1020
01:28:58,333 --> 01:28:59,899
What's that
supposed to mean?

1021
01:28:59,986 --> 01:29:01,640
You could kill a man
in cold blood,

1022
01:29:01,727 --> 01:29:03,555
but you can't even make it
with your wife.

1023
01:29:03,642 --> 01:29:05,731
That's what it means.

1024
01:29:05,818 --> 01:29:08,255
She couldn't stand
the sight of you!

1025
01:29:14,392 --> 01:29:17,482
It's a lie, it's a lie.

1026
01:29:17,569 --> 01:29:18,701
No.

1027
01:29:20,311 --> 01:29:23,053
Nikki would never
tell you that.

1028
01:29:23,140 --> 01:29:24,315
Not Nikki.

1029
01:29:41,767 --> 01:29:44,204
I'll try Tora.
Maybe she's heard from her.

1030
01:30:08,620 --> 01:30:10,448
Hello?JERRI:
This is Jerri.

1031
01:30:10,535 --> 01:30:13,408
Is Michele with you?Michele?

1032
01:30:13,495 --> 01:30:15,322
She disappeared
from the hospital.

1033
01:30:15,410 --> 01:30:17,281
Oh, my God.

1034
01:30:17,368 --> 01:30:20,023
The police checked out
her hotel. She left there.

1035
01:30:20,110 --> 01:30:22,678
Well, she moved over to Joe's.

1036
01:30:22,765 --> 01:30:24,419
Do you know
where he lives?

1037
01:30:24,506 --> 01:30:26,682
She gave me the address.
Wait just a minute.

1038
01:30:36,082 --> 01:30:38,128
I wrote it down.

1039
01:30:48,530 --> 01:30:49,705
What? What?

1040
01:30:49,792 --> 01:30:54,536
It's party time.
Surprise party time.

1041
01:30:54,623 --> 01:30:57,800
Description of subject remains as before.

1042
01:30:57,887 --> 01:31:02,021
Address of Joseph Brodnek
is 320 Ardmore Street,

1043
01:31:02,108 --> 01:31:04,241
Apartment 104.

1044
01:31:04,328 --> 01:31:06,722
Code Three.

1045
01:31:38,841 --> 01:31:40,407
You'll be right here.

1046
01:31:40,495 --> 01:31:43,019
Just like that.

1047
01:32:42,992 --> 01:32:44,341
Oh, my God, Michele.

1048
01:32:44,428 --> 01:32:45,560
No!

1049
01:33:04,622 --> 01:33:08,017
Ten, 20, 25.

1050
01:33:10,106 --> 01:33:11,716
A hundred and twenty-five
dollars.

1051
01:33:11,803 --> 01:33:14,153
Oh, I figured a hundred.It's my adding machine.

1052
01:33:14,240 --> 01:33:15,546
Are you gonna fight it
for 25 bucks?

1053
01:33:15,633 --> 01:33:17,287
Not me.

1054
01:33:17,374 --> 01:33:19,115
I hate to see you go,
Michele.

1055
01:33:19,202 --> 01:33:20,682
You've always
got a job here.

1056
01:33:20,769 --> 01:33:22,379
Well, thanks.
I'll remember that.

1057
01:33:22,466 --> 01:33:23,641
Good luck.

1058
01:33:23,728 --> 01:33:24,860
I'll need it.

1059
01:33:34,783 --> 01:33:37,220
Hi, honey.
Listen, we gotta go downtown.

1060
01:33:37,307 --> 01:33:39,788
We gotta get some kind
of a green card.

1061
01:33:39,875 --> 01:33:42,094
But I called them this morning
and they said we don't

1062
01:33:42,181 --> 01:33:44,053
need a passport
just to get to Mexico City,

1063
01:33:44,140 --> 01:33:46,446
but we do need some other kind
of a little card.

1064
01:33:46,533 --> 01:33:48,753
Then we have to go by
and get some shots.

1065
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:51,016
And, uh, then...

1066
01:33:51,103 --> 01:33:53,366
Michele.

1067
01:33:53,453 --> 01:33:55,194
Listen,
what are you doing?

1068
01:33:58,023 --> 01:34:00,112
Suppose I said
I don't want to go?

1069
01:34:02,941 --> 01:34:04,290
Well, you can't do that.

1070
01:34:04,377 --> 01:34:06,989
Not after all our plans
and everything.

1071
01:34:07,076 --> 01:34:09,948
We made those plans
when Alan was alive.

1072
01:34:10,035 --> 01:34:12,081
Well, what's that got
to do with anything?

1073
01:34:12,168 --> 01:34:16,128
I mean, how does that
change anything?

1074
01:34:16,215 --> 01:34:17,913
What do you mean?
We stay here now.

1075
01:34:21,177 --> 01:34:23,353
What's so important
about here?

1076
01:34:23,440 --> 01:34:26,051
What the hell is so important
about going down to Mexico?

1077
01:34:28,663 --> 01:34:29,838
Michele, you wanna know
what's important?

1078
01:34:29,925 --> 01:34:33,624
You and I,
that's what's important.

1079
01:34:35,539 --> 01:34:38,411
I've heard that one before.

1080
01:34:38,498 --> 01:34:41,240
Look, I never stayed anyplace
in my life.

1081
01:34:41,327 --> 01:34:43,721
I never kept house.
I never had a bank account.

1082
01:34:43,808 --> 01:34:45,201
Or a husband.

1083
01:34:46,768 --> 01:34:48,726
Or a kid.
How's that grab you?

1084
01:34:55,211 --> 01:34:57,300
Michele,

1085
01:34:57,387 --> 01:34:59,171
we got something
going now,

1086
01:34:59,258 --> 01:35:01,957
so why do you want
to run away from it?

1087
01:35:02,044 --> 01:35:05,134
I mean,
what do you got?

1088
01:35:05,221 --> 01:35:06,657
Well, I've always
got my wheels,

1089
01:35:06,744 --> 01:35:08,093
and I can go anyplace,
any time.

1090
01:35:08,180 --> 01:35:10,139
That's how I like it.

1091
01:35:11,488 --> 01:35:13,011
You got your wheels.

1092
01:35:13,098 --> 01:35:15,274
Mm, there she goes.

1093
01:35:15,361 --> 01:35:18,669
Bombshell, see you in a year,
maybe two.

1094
01:35:18,756 --> 01:35:20,758
What the hell is that?

1095
01:35:20,845 --> 01:35:22,281
You just gonna
keep running?

1096
01:35:24,719 --> 01:35:27,199
I don't belong to anybody.

1097
01:35:27,286 --> 01:35:29,375
I want you to belong
to somebody.

1098
01:35:31,160 --> 01:35:32,335
Me.

1099
01:35:37,601 --> 01:35:40,386
Come here.

1100
01:35:40,473 --> 01:35:42,867
You sure are something,
I'll tell you.

1101
01:35:42,954 --> 01:35:45,957
Joe, why can't you
understand?

1102
01:35:48,830 --> 01:35:50,396
I don't want
to be tied down.

1103
01:35:51,963 --> 01:35:53,138
I need you.

1104
01:35:56,402 --> 01:35:59,536
We could have a ball together
in Mexico City.

1105
01:35:59,623 --> 01:36:03,061
We could have a life
right here.

1106
01:36:06,804 --> 01:36:08,371
You just make it tough.

1107
01:36:08,458 --> 01:36:10,068
Either we go or we don't go.

1108
01:36:10,155 --> 01:36:11,374
I'm not going.

1109
01:36:16,161 --> 01:36:17,554
I'm not going.

1110
01:36:22,080 --> 01:36:23,647
Take care of yourself, huh?

1111
01:37:09,084 --> 01:37:10,215
Whoo!

1112
01:37:13,088 --> 01:37:15,046
Oh, yes.

1113
01:37:15,133 --> 01:37:16,265
Oh!

1114
01:37:32,585 --> 01:37:35,893
#No matter what I say

1115
01:37:35,980 --> 01:37:38,243
# Or what I do

1116
01:37:38,330 --> 01:37:42,813
# In spite of myself
I want to hurry to you

1117
01:37:42,900 --> 01:37:44,771
# And flare up

1118
01:37:44,859 --> 01:37:46,034
# Flare up

1119
01:37:46,121 --> 01:37:47,470
# Flare up

1120
01:37:47,557 --> 01:37:48,688
# Flare up

1121
01:37:48,775 --> 01:37:49,951
# Flare up

1122
01:37:50,038 --> 01:37:52,997
# Flare up
