1
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,300
In the last century
before the birth...

2
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:56,000
of the new faith
called Christianity...

3
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:59,000
which was destined to overthrow
the pagan tyranny of Rome...

4
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,300
and bring about a new society...

5
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:06,200
the Roman republics toodat the very
centre of the civilized world.

6
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,900
'"Of all things fairest, '"
sang the poet...

7
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,600
'"first among cities and
home of the gods is golden Rome. '"

8
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:16,400
Yet even at the zenith
of her pride and power...

9
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,800
the Republic lay fatally stricken
with a disease called...

10
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,100
human slavery.

11
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,700
The age of the dictator
was at hand...

12
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:28,700
waiting in the shadows
for the event to bring it forth.

13
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,900
In that same century...

14
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,700
in the conquered
Greek province of Thrace...

15
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:37,100
an illiterate slave woman
added to her master's wealth...

16
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,600
by giving birth to a son
whom she named Spartacus.

17
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,000
A proud, rebellious son...

18
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:47,100
who was sold to living death
in the mines of Libya...

19
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,200
before his thirteenth birthday.

20
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:53,100
There, under whip
and chain and sun...

21
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,900
he lived out his youth
and his young manhood...

22
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,300
dreaming the death of slavery...

23
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,900
2,000 years
before it finally would die.

24
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:49,200
Back to work!

25
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:58,800
Get up, Spartacus,
you Thracian dog!

26
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,200
Come on, get up!

27
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:04,700
My ankle, my ankle!

28
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,800
My ankle!

29
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,300
Spartacus again?
This time he dies.

30
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,500
Back to work, all of you!

31
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:46,500
- Welcome, Lentulus Batiatus.
- Welcome, indeed, my dear captain.

32
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,400
Eleven miles
through the disastrous heat...

33
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:58,400
and the cost
of hiring an escort-- ruinous.

34
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:02,600
Even so, I warrant you have nothing
fit to sell me, have you, Captain?

35
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:06,400
I've wasted my time and my money.
Tell me the truth.

36
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,600
I think we have a few
you might be interested in.

37
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:13,500
What, these? Carrion!
The buzzards are late.

38
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,200
This one here's not bad.
He's a Gaul.

39
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,000
I don't like Gauls. Hairy.

40
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:24,500
-Can he come down from there unassisted?
-Come down, you!

41
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,400
Come down!

42
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,600
Be good enough
to show me the teeth.

43
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,600
- Open your mouth!
- Thank you.

44
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,400
Yes. As the teeth go,
so go the bones.

45
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,900
This mouth is
really impermissible.

46
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,900
- The fellow's made of chalk.
- We have others. Many others!

47
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,800
The sun's over there.
I have to pay these people.

48
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,300
Who's that?

49
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:06,100
This one's a Thracian.
I'm making an example of him.

50
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,100
- How?
- Starve him to death.

51
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,400
It's the only thing impresses slaves.

52
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,600
What a pity.

53
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:21,200
He reacts. Good muscle tone.
Can I see his teeth?

54
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:24,200
Open your mouth, Spartacus!

55
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,900
You smell like a rhinoceros.

56
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:34,000
Captain, you asked him to open
his mouth. He doesn't obey you?

57
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,100
His teeth are
the best thing about him.

58
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,700
He hamstrung a guard with them
not more than an hour ago.

59
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,300
Hamstrung? How marvellous!
I wish I'd been here.

60
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,100
I'll take him.
Let's look at some of the others.

61
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,700
Come along!

62
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:59,800
In spite of sickness and death,
we will profit 11,000 sesterces!

63
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:02,100
Including your commission,
of course.

64
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,500
No, sir.
Without my commission.

65
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,400
Marcellus, there they are.

66
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,000
They're a dirty-looking lot,
but it's the best I could find.

67
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,700
No one else could have made
so fine a choice.

68
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,500
Slaves...

69
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,800
you have arrived at the gladiatorial
school of Lentulus Batiatus.

70
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:31,000
Here you will be trained by experts
to fight in pairs to the death.

71
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,900
Obviously, you won't be required
to fight to the death here.

72
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,100
That will only be
after you've been sold...

73
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,300
and then for ladies
and gentlemen of quality...

74
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,900
those who appreciate
a fine kill.

75
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,700
A gladiator's like a stallion:
He must be pampered.

76
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,000
You'll be oiled, bathed...

77
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,100
shaved, massaged,
taught to use your heads.

78
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:56,900
A good body with a dull brain
is as cheap as life itself!

79
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,100
You'll be given
your ceremonial caudas.

80
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,300
Marcellus, please. There.

81
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,600
Be proud of them.

82
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:08,400
On certain special occasions,
those of you who please me...

83
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:12,100
will even be given
the companionship of a young lady.

84
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,900
Approximately half our graduates...

85
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:18,900
live for five, ten-- ten years.

86
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,300
Some of them
even attain freedom...

87
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,200
and become trainers themselves.

88
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,300
Marcellus.

89
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:31,000
I congratulate you.
And may fortune smile on most of you.

90
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,100
Marcellus, watch the second
from the right.

91
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,800
He's a Thracian. They were going
to kill him for hamstringing a guard.

92
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:46,300
- We'll break him of that.
- Don't overdo it. He has quality.

93
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,200
Next.

94
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,400
Next.

95
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,400
I like you.

96
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,700
I want you
to be my friend.

97
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,200
I want to be your friend.

98
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:22,600
All I ask is that
you get along with me.

99
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,900
What's your name, slave?

100
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,700
Spartacus.

101
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,600
I feel you don't like me.

102
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,200
Give him your sword.

103
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,300
Take it!

104
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,100
I have a feeling
you want to kill me.

105
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,300
This is the only chance
you'll ever get.

106
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,300
Kill me!

107
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,900
Don't be afraid, slave.

108
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,200
You have that sword.

109
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:11,100
I only have
this piece of wood!

110
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,500
Are you going
to disobey me?

111
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,400
Take his sword.

112
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,700
You're not as stupid
as I thought.

113
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,300
You might even be intelligent.

114
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,800
That's dangerous for slaves.

115
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,900
You just remember...

116
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,500
from now on, everything you do,
I'll be watching.

117
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,900
You did the right thing.

118
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,300
Every once in a while, Marcellus likes
to kill a man as an example.

119
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:19,200
I think he's picked you.
Better watch him.

120
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,500
- How long have you been here?
- Six months.

121
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,700
I wish he'd pick me.

122
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:31,000
I want one chance at that pig
before they carry me out!

123
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,500
Quiet!
No talking down there.

124
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:38,400
You'll get us all in trouble,
just like in the mines.

125
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,100
What's your name?

126
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,500
You don't want
to know my name.

127
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,200
I don't want
to know your name.

128
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:55,000
Just a friendly question.

129
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,600
Gladiators don't make friends.

130
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:00,300
If we're ever matched
in the arena together...

131
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,500
I'll have to kill you.

132
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,000
Helena...

133
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,500
with Galino.

134
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,300
Patricia...

135
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,900
Crixus.

136
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,100
Priscilla...

137
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,200
David.

138
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,800
Claudia...

139
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,500
Pharox.

140
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,900
Varinia...

141
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,800
- Dionysius.
- No, no. Spartacus.

142
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,400
Spartacus.

143
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,100
Felicia--

144
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,300
I've never had a woman.

145
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:02,700
You have one now, Spartacus.
You must take her.

146
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,900
- Go away.
- What will she think of you?

147
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,100
Indeed, what will I think of you?

148
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,300
Go away.

149
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:13,700
Come, come. Be generous.
We must learn to share our pleasures.

150
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,900
I'm not an animal!

151
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,200
You're not trying to escape,
by any chance?

152
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,000
Direct your courage
to the girl, Spartacus.

153
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,800
I'm not an animal!

154
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:38,000
- I'm not an animal.
- Neither am l.

155
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,500
What's your name?

156
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,700
Varinia.

157
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,300
You'll have to take her
out of here, Marcellus.

158
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,500
You may not be
an animal, Spartacus...

159
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,100
but this sorry show
gives me very little hope...

160
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,100
that you'll ever be a man.

161
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,400
First rule:

162
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,600
You get an instant kill
on the red.

163
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:25,200
Here. Here.

164
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,600
Always remember:
Go for the red first...

165
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,600
because if you don't,
your opponent will.

166
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,900
In the blue,
you get a cripple.

167
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,800
Here, here...

168
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,800
here and here.

169
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,100
Second rule:

170
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,700
Go for the cripple
before the slow kill.

171
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,800
Here's a slow kill
on the yellow.

172
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:50,800
Here, here...

173
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,600
and here.

174
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,300
Remember...

175
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,800
A slow kill may have enough left
in him to kill you before he dies.

176
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:00,000
With a cripple,
you know you've got him...

177
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,900
if you keep your distance
and wear him down.

178
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,100
The rest is all right
for a public spectacle in Rome...

179
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:08,500
but here at Capua we expect
more than simple butchery...

180
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,600
and we get it.

181
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:15,900
Spartacus, why are you looking
at that girl?

182
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,000
Varinia! Stand still.

183
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,100
Since all he can do
is look at girls...

184
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,200
all right, slave,
go ahead and look.

185
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,500
I said look!

186
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:19,200
No. No, this one
goes to the Spaniard.

187
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:29,000
Have a good night's rest,
Spartacus.

188
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,900
In there.

189
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:24,100
Woman!

190
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,300
I've warned you
about this kind of thing.

191
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,600
All right, bring them in.

192
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,500
No talking!
Move along there.

193
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,600
Did they hurt you?

194
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,900
No.

195
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,000
That's a kill.

196
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:56,300
One, two...

197
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:59,300
three, four, five.

198
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:03,700
One, two, three, four.

199
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,000
We have visitors.
Tremendous visitors!

200
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:05,400
Two simply enormous Roman lords
on the hill.

201
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,600
How easily impressed
you are, Ramon.

202
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,800
Just 'cause they're Romans,
I suppose they're enormous.

203
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,000
Tell them to wait for me
when they arrive.

204
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,300
-Master, you don't understand!
-How enormous do these Roman lords get?

205
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:18,300
One of them is
Marcus Licinius Crassus.

206
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,400
What? Wait a minute.

207
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:23,900
Crassus here? Varinia,
my red toga with the acorns.

208
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,900
And some chairs in the atrium.
Second-best wine.

209
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:29,900
No, the best,
but small goblets.

210
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:32,000
Gracchus! You know
how Crassus loathes him.

211
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:36,000
Take him away.

212
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:39,600
- I can't lift it.
- Use your imagination! Cover him.

213
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:42,200
Tell Marcellus
to get the men ready.

214
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,600
Crassus has expensive taste.
He'll want a show of some sort.

215
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,800
Forgive me, Gracchus.

216
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:14,000
Marcus Licinius Crassus...

217
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,000
most noble radiance...

218
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:18,400
first general of the Republic...

219
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:21,200
father and defender of Rome...

220
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:24,800
honour my house.
Bless it with your presence.

221
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:38,500
Wine! Sweetmeats! Can't you see
that Their Honours are exhausted?

222
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:44,200
Have the goodness to sit.

223
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,500
Is anything wrong,
Your Nobility?

224
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,400
No.

225
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,600
Welcome
to the Lady Claudia Maria...

226
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:01,400
former wife
of Lucius Caius Marius...

227
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:05,600
whose recent execution
touched us all so deeply.

228
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,700
Honour to the Lady Helena...

229
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,400
daughter of the late
Septimus Optimus Glabrus...

230
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:14,100
whose fame shall live on forever
in the person of his son...

231
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:19,400
your brother,
Marcus Publius Glabrus...

232
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,600
hero of the Eastern Wars.

233
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:24,000
How very much he knows.

234
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:26,400
Allow me to bring you
up to date.

235
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:30,300
We're here to celebrate the marriage
of my brother to the Lady Claudia.

236
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:33,100
A mating of eagles,
Your Sanctity!

237
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,400
Fan His Magnitude.
He sweats.

238
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:38,900
My young friends desire
a private showing of two pairs.

239
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,200
Two pairs. Oh, yes.

240
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,200
I think I have something
that would please them.

241
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:48,300
- Two pairs to the death.
- To the death, Your Ladyship?

242
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:53,200
Surely you don't think we came
all the way to Capua for gymnastics?

243
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:56,200
But I beg Your Honours.

244
00:34:56,300 --> 00:35:00,000
Here in Capua we train
the finest gladiators in all Italy.

245
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:02,200
We can give you a display
of swordsmanship...

246
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:05,000
which is better than anything
you can see in Rome at any cost.

247
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:07,900
When they're sold, their new masters
may do with them as they wish...

248
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,400
but here, no, we never fight them
to the death.

249
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,900
Crassus.

250
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,100
Today is an exception.

251
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:20,200
But the ill feeling it would spread
through the whole school.

252
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:23,400
And then the cost. The cost!

253
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,600
Name your price.

254
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:30,300
25,000 sesterces.

255
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,200
Arrange it.

256
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,800
Are you serious, sir?

257
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:39,000
Arrange it immediately.

258
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:43,200
Of course, we shall want
to choose them ourselves.

259
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:46,500
You do have a certain variety,
don't you?

260
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,500
Yes. Inexhaustible.

261
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:59,300
Spartacus, there's going to be
a fight to the death.

262
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,100
- To the death?
- How do you know?

263
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,500
I heard Marcellus
tell one of his guards.

264
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,700
- Who fights?
- I don't know.

265
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,800
To the death.

266
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,700
What if they matched
you and me?

267
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,700
They won't.

268
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,000
What if they did?

269
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:23,200
Would you fight?

270
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:27,600
I'd have to. So would you.

271
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,600
Would you try to kill me?

272
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,400
Yes, I'd kill.

273
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,600
I'd try to save--

274
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:39,700
I'd try to stay alive
and so would you.

275
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:42,700
All gladiators
up to the training area.

276
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:45,300
Some visitors
want to admire you.

277
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,200
Form a line
right here in front of me.

278
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:56,500
Would Your Excellencies care
to make your selection now?

279
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,200
Claudia.

280
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:11,300
They're magnificent.

281
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:13,400
For you, Lady Helena...

282
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:16,600
may I suggest Praxus?

283
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,500
A veritable tiger.

284
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:23,000
I don't like him.

285
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:31,200
- I prefer that one.
- Which one?

286
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:34,200
David?

287
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:37,700
Crixus, yes.

288
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,800
Marcellus, Crixus
for the short sword.

289
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:47,500
Have you ever seen such a pair
of shoulders? Dionysius!

290
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:53,400
I admit he's small, but he's very
compact and extremely strong.

291
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,400
In fact, he looks--

292
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:59,300
He looks smaller here
than he does in the actual arena.

293
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:03,000
Optical.

294
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:06,800
- Give me that one.
- Galino.

295
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,900
Yes, yes. Galino.

296
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,200
You have a shrewd eye, Your Pulchritude,
if I may permit myself the--

297
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:19,900
Practically every man in this school
is an expert with a Thracian sword...

298
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,100
but the trident is something
very rare these days.

299
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,500
May I suggest...

300
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,500
the Ethiopian?

301
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:33,300
There are very few Ethiopians
in the country.

302
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:37,300
Ethiopians are recognized
as masters of the trident.

303
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,600
I'll take him.

304
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:49,200
Draba? Oh, no.
For you I want only the best--

305
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,200
I want the most beautiful.

306
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,300
I'll take the big black one.

307
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,800
Very good.

308
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:01,200
Only one man
in the entire school...

309
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:06,500
stands a chance with the Thracian knife
against the trident.

310
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,700
There.

311
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,400
- Over there, Lady Helena.
- He's impertinent!

312
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,900
- I'll take him.
- Impertinent, and a coward to boot.

313
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Have him flogged!

314
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:23,000
Over there, Lady Helena.
The beast of Libya.

315
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:26,500
I prefer the coward.

316
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,500
If both men are down
and refuse to continue to fight...

317
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,700
your trainer will slit their throats
like chickens.

318
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:38,300
- We want no tricks.
- Tricks? At the school of Batiatus?

319
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,400
You heard the instruction, Marcellus?
Remember it.

320
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:45,800
I feel so sorry for the poor things
in all this heat.

321
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:48,500
Don't put them
in those suffocating tunics.

322
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:51,200
Let them wear just enough
for modesty.

323
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:54,700
Whatever they wear, Lady,
they'll bless your name.

324
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,100
Back, the rest of you!

325
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:01,200
- Our choosing has bored you?
- No.

326
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:03,400
Most exciting. I tingle.

327
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,600
Do let's get out of the sun.

328
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:09,400
May I conduct Your Magnificences
to the gallery now?

329
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,800
An eavesdropper.
Oh, the god!

330
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:29,000
How far from Rome must I go
to avoid that cunning face?

331
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:32,400
Crassus, don't talk about Gracchus.
He's so hateful.

332
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:35,000
For Gracchus, hatred of the patrician
class is a profession...

333
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,100
and not such a bad one, either.

334
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,500
How else can one become
master of the mob...

335
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,900
and first senator of Rome?

336
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,600
Crassus, it's so boring.

337
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,100
I believe that girl smells
of perfume.

338
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:55,900
Whatever it is,
she smells most delectable.

339
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,600
You can't keep slaves from stealing
these days unless you chain them.

340
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:02,700
When a slave's as pretty as she is,
she doesn't have to steal.

341
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,100
An arrangement is made.

342
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,900
If her ankles are good...

343
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,100
you could be sure
an arrangement was made!

344
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:17,000
- Master!
- Good heavens, a catastrophe!

345
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,300
- I've been anointed!
- You trollop!

346
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:23,000
- I believe you did that on purpose.
- It was an accident. Come here, girl.

347
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:30,400
Don't be frightened.

348
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:33,500
- What country are you from?
- Britannia.

349
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:36,400
How long have you been
a slave?

350
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,900
Since I was thirteen.

351
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,300
You have a certain education.

352
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:48,500
My first master had me tutored
for his children.

353
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:58,600
I like her. She has spirit.

354
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:01,500
- I'll buy her.
- Buy her, Your Magnificence?

355
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:04,000
I have spent
quite a lot of money on her.

356
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:06,400
Yes, I've no doubt of it.
Two thousand sesterces.

357
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:08,800
Two thou--
She'll be waiting at your litter.

358
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:11,300
No, I don't want her feet
spoilt by walking.

359
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:16,100
Send her to Rome with your steward
the next time he has to go there.

360
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,200
He leaves tomorrow
and the girl with him.

361
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:22,500
More wine.
And thank your gods!

362
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:25,100
You provoke me, Crassus.
I shan't be nice to you any more!

363
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:28,300
- Why distress me so much?
- You're horribly rich.

364
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,500
Yet you're the only one
of my brother's friends...

365
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:33,700
who hasn't given him
a wedding present.

366
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:40,300
I was saving it
for a more suitable moment.

367
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,400
Here. Give it to him, child.

368
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,400
What is it?

369
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:49,200
As from this moment, your husband
is commander of the garrison of Rome.

370
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,900
Wonderful!

371
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:58,200
I don't know how I shall
ever be able to repay you.

372
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:00,400
Time will solve that mystery.

373
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,900
- The garrison of Rome.
- Yes.

374
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,800
The only power in Rome strong enough
to checkmate Gracchus and his senate.

375
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:12,000
You are clever!

376
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,700
Open up.

377
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,700
Through that door.

378
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,100
But you will have
to watch him, Claudia.

379
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,700
Father almost disinherited him
because of slave girls.

380
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:11,500
The marriage contract
absolutely forbids a harem.

381
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:14,700
What about your litter bearers?

382
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,000
After all, every one of them
is under 20...

383
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:19,200
and taller than they should be.

384
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:21,800
She sets rather a high standard
for you, does she ?

385
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:24,600
Your pleasure, Your Highness.

386
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:30,600
To you, my dear, shall go the honour
of starting this poetic drama.

387
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Open up!

388
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:44,000
First pair:
Crixus and Galino!

389
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:05,500
Those who are about to die
salute you.

390
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,500
Crixus.

391
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:57,200
Next pair!

392
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:22,000
Those who are about to die,
salute you.

393
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:18,400
Your Thracian's doing well.

394
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:22,000
How were you able to get my appointment
without Gracchus knowing?

395
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:25,900
I fought fire with oil.
I purchased the senate behind his back.

396
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,500
I still think
the trident's going to win.

397
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:58,300
- Why doesn't he kill him?
- Kill him.

398
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:02,000
What's the matter now?

399
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,900
- Kill him!
- Kill him, you imbecile!

400
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:57,400
He'll hang there till he rots.

401
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:34,100
Take a last look, Spartacus.

402
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:36,100
She's going to Rome.
She's been sold.

403
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:41,400
She's been sold?

404
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,100
No talking
in the kitchen, slave.

405
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:43,900
There's trouble in the mess hall.
They killed Marcellus and maybe others.

406
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:46,000
Call out the guard!

407
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:48,300
Move, move!

408
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:53,100
On second thoughts,
I'll deliver the girl personally.

409
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:56,400
Ride to Capua. Call out the garrison.
I don't trust this lot.

410
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:59,000
- I hold you responsible.
- Yes, sir.

411
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:57,500
Around Capua,
they ravaged the countryside...

412
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:59,900
forcing other slaves to join them.

413
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,600
Looting, robbing,
burning everything...

414
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:09,400
while they make their camp
in the escarpments of Vesuvius.

415
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:12,900
Each day swells their numbers.

416
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:16,000
The situation presently lies
in the hands...

417
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:18,200
of this august body.

418
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:23,400
Where's the mighty Crassus?

419
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:26,600
- Out of the city.
- At least you're here.

420
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:30,100
No need to fear for Rome
as long as Glabrus is with us.

421
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:35,000
Let me add: Over 1 00 estates
have been burned...

422
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:38,100
among them, gentlemen,
my own...

423
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:42,700
burned to the ground
and three million sesterces lost.

424
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:47,300
I propose the immediate recall
of Pompey and his legions from Spain.

425
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:51,200
- I could bring them in with 500 men!
- Don't make a fool of yourself.

426
00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:55,400
Why call back the legions...

427
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:58,100
when the garrison of Rome
has nothing to do...

428
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:02,100
but to defend us
from sausage makers?

429
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:04,300
Let's send Glabrus
against these scoundrels!

430
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:06,500
Give 'em a taste of Roman steel.

431
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:13,500
I protest.
I most strongly protest.

432
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:15,700
There are more slaves
in Rome than Romans.

433
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:20,400
With the garrison absent,
what's to prevent them from rising too?

434
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:23,700
I did not say
the whole garrison.

435
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:26,300
Six cohorts will
more than do the job.

436
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:30,100
The rest can stay in Rome
to save you from your housemaids.

437
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,400
Will you accept
such a charge, Glabrus?

438
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,300
I accept the charge
of the senate...

439
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:45,100
if the senate truly charges me.

440
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,200
The garrison of Rome
stands ready.

441
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:56,600
Slave hunting's a dirty business.

442
00:59:56,700 --> 00:59:58,900
It takes a brave commander
to consent to it.

443
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,100
I propose we turn
the city out tomorrow...

444
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:03,900
in tribute to Glabrus
as he marches through.

445
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:08,700
And...

446
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:12,000
for temporary command
of the garrison during his absence...

447
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:15,700
I propose Caius Julius Caesar.

448
01:00:31,100 --> 01:00:35,000
You don't look very happy
over the new job.

449
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,800
It's not a serious disturbance.
Glabrus will be back.

450
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:40,300
Maybe.

451
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:42,400
At least it gives me a chance...

452
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:45,100
to separate Glabrus
from Crassus for a while.

453
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:50,100
You know, this republic of ours
is something like a rich widow.

454
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:52,400
Most Romans love her
as their mother.

455
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:56,400
But Crassus dreams of marrying
the old girl, to put it politely.

456
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:59,800
Hail Glabrus!
Hail Glabrus!

457
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:09,400
- God be with you, Glabrus.
- And with you too.

458
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:18,800
I hope he returns
to such applause.

459
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:21,500
One fat one, Fimbria!

460
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:29,600
No, keep the change.
Give it to your wife.

461
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:33,700
- May the gods adore you.
- Only through your prayers.

462
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:38,200
Let's make an old-fashioned sacrifice
for Glabrus' success.

463
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:40,300
I thought you had reservations
about the gods.

464
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:42,700
Privately I believe in none of them.
Neither do you.

465
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:44,900
Publicly I believe in them all.

466
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:47,300
Greetings, Marcus Clodius Flavius!

467
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:18,800
Is Marcus Glabrus in attendance?

468
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:21,100
- He awaits you in the atrium, sir.
- Excellent.

469
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:25,300
What have we here?

470
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:27,700
A gift from the governor
of Sicily, sir.

471
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:44,700
Antoninus.

472
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:47,700
Sicilian, age 26.

473
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:50,200
Singer of songs.

474
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:52,800
For whom did you practice
this wondrous talent?

475
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:55,300
For the children of my master...

476
01:02:55,300 --> 01:02:57,500
whom I also taught
the classics.

477
01:02:57,600 --> 01:02:59,900
Classics, indeed.

478
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:05,000
What position have we, I wonder,
for a boy of such varied gifts?

479
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:08,500
You shall be my body servant.
Instruct him.

480
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:10,600
All of you, come with me.

481
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:27,800
Are you on guard duty?

482
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:33,100
My dear Crassus,
congratulate me.

483
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:36,800
Or better still,
let us congratulate each other.

484
01:03:37,300 --> 01:03:39,400
I congratulate us.

485
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:41,900
Tomorrow I lead six cohorts
of the garrison...

486
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,100
against the slaves on Vesuvius.

487
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:46,600
The whole city
is turning out to see us off.

488
01:03:46,700 --> 01:03:49,200
Great merciful
bloodstained gods!

489
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,100
Your pardon.

490
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:56,000
I always address heaven
in moments of triumph.

491
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,900
Did Gracchus have something
to do with this brilliant affair?

492
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:02,500
Yes, he even proposed it.
Rather decently, too.

493
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:05,300
And you? Do you think I made you
commander of the garrison...

494
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:08,800
to control some rock patch
on Vesuvius?

495
01:04:08,900 --> 01:04:11,000
It was to control
the streets of Rome!

496
01:04:11,100 --> 01:04:14,900
I only take six cohorts.
The rest of the garrison remains.

497
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,400
- Under whose command?
- Under Caesar's.

498
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:20,300
Excellent, excellent!

499
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:22,800
Finding Gracchus in control
of the mob and the senate...

500
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:26,500
you felt compelled to hand over
the garrison to him also.

501
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:29,700
I see.

502
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:33,400
I'll refuse. I'll withdraw
from the expedition.

503
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:35,600
One of the disadvantages
of being a patrician...

504
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:38,300
is that occasionally
you're obliged to act like one.

505
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:40,500
You pledged the senate to go,
and go you must.

506
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:42,900
If Gracchus should decide
to move against you--

507
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,200
He won't!
Has no need to.

508
01:04:45,300 --> 01:04:49,000
He has, with your assistance,
immobilized me altogether.

509
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:52,800
Your legions are still in camp
outside the city walls?

510
01:04:54,300 --> 01:04:56,400
My legions?

511
01:04:56,500 --> 01:04:59,000
Do you truly believe I'd order
my legions to enter Rome?

512
01:04:59,100 --> 01:05:01,700
I only point out that
you can if you have to.

513
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:04,300
Are you not aware
of Rome's most ancient law...

514
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:07,600
that no general may enter the city
at the head of his armed legions?

515
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:11,500
- Sulla did.
- Sulla? To the infamy of his name!

516
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:14,200
To the utter damnation
of his line!

517
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:17,500
No, my young friend.

518
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:22,600
One day I shall cleanse this Rome
which my fathers bequeathed me.

519
01:05:22,700 --> 01:05:27,300
I shall restore all the traditions
that made her great.

520
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:30,200
It follows, then, that I cannot come
to power or even defend myself...

521
01:05:30,300 --> 01:05:34,400
by an act which betrays
the most sacred tradition of them all.

522
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:38,200
I shall not bring my legions
within these walls.

523
01:05:38,900 --> 01:05:42,100
I shall not violate Rome...

524
01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:44,400
at the moment
of possessing her.

525
01:05:47,700 --> 01:05:49,000
Go.

526
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:52,500
Prepare your troops
at once.

527
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:56,900
March out of Rome tonight,
but the city tribute is impossible.

528
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:01,100
We've already been made to look a fool.
Let's not add the trappings of a clown.

529
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:05,200
Leave by unfrequented streets,
without fanfare, without even a drum!

530
01:06:06,700 --> 01:06:08,800
Sneak out.

531
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:12,300
As you wish.

532
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:14,800
And for heaven's sake,
my young friend...

533
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:18,300
try and see to it that you don't have
to sneak back again.

534
01:06:19,300 --> 01:06:21,100
Farewell.

535
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:47,700
Come on, fat boy!

536
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:34,500
Noble Romans...

537
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:37,000
fighting each other
like animals!

538
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,400
Your new masters,
betting to see who'll die first.

539
01:09:43,900 --> 01:09:46,000
Drop your swords.

540
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:56,400
I want to see their blood
right over here where Draba died!

541
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:00,800
When I fight matched pairs,
they fight to the death.

542
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:05,800
I made myself a promise, Crixus.

543
01:10:05,900 --> 01:10:07,900
I swore that
if I ever got out of this place...

544
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:11,500
I'd die before I'd watch
two men fight to the death again.

545
01:10:14,900 --> 01:10:17,200
Draba made that promise too.

546
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:20,600
He kept it.

547
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:22,700
So will l.

548
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:28,900
Go on. Get out!

549
01:10:32,100 --> 01:10:34,200
What are we, Crixus?

550
01:10:34,300 --> 01:10:36,900
What are we becoming?
Romans?

551
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,600
Have we learned nothing?
What's happening to us?

552
01:10:39,700 --> 01:10:42,300
We look for wine
when we should be hunting bread.

553
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:45,300
When you've got wine,
you don't need bread!

554
01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:49,500
You can't just be a gang
of drunken raiders.

555
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:53,500
- What else can we be?
- Gladiators!

556
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:55,900
An army of gladiators.

557
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,200
There's never been
an army like that.

558
01:10:58,200 --> 01:11:01,000
One gladiator's worth
any two Roman soldiers that ever lived.

559
01:11:01,100 --> 01:11:03,500
We beat the Roman guards,
but a Roman army's a different thing.

560
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:05,600
They fight different
than we do too.

561
01:11:05,700 --> 01:11:09,600
We can beat anything they send
against us if we really want to.

562
01:11:09,700 --> 01:11:12,500
- It takes a big army for that.
- We'll have a big army.

563
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:14,600
Once we're on the march...

564
01:11:14,700 --> 01:11:16,900
we'll free every slave
in every town and village.

565
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,100
Can anybody get
a bigger army than that?

566
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:21,100
Once we cross the Alps,
we're safe!

567
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:24,600
Nobody can cross the Alps. Every pass
is defended by its own legion.

568
01:11:24,700 --> 01:11:27,600
There's only one way
to get out of this country.

569
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:29,700
The sea.

570
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:32,600
What good is the sea
if you have no ships?

571
01:11:32,700 --> 01:11:35,300
The Cilician pirates have ships.

572
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:37,900
They're at war with Rome.

573
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:41,100
Every Roman galley that sails
out of Brundusium pays tribute to them.

574
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:43,300
They've got the biggest fleet
in the world.

575
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:46,500
I was a galley slave with them. They'll
take you anywhere for enough gold.

576
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:48,500
We haven't got enough gold.

577
01:11:48,500 --> 01:11:50,900
Take every Roman we capture
and warm his back a little.

578
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:54,600
- We'll have gold, all right.
- Spartacus is right!

579
01:11:55,900 --> 01:11:59,000
Let's hire these pirates
and march straight to Brundusium!

580
01:12:45,900 --> 01:12:48,800
Come join us.
All of you, come join us.

581
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:08,900
Come on and join us!

582
01:13:33,900 --> 01:13:36,000
Back to Vesuvius!

583
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:58,500
Varinia.

584
01:14:03,900 --> 01:14:06,800
I thought
I'd never see you again.

585
01:14:20,700 --> 01:14:23,100
Everything's so different.

586
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,300
The last time I saw you...

587
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:36,100
you were waiting
in the arena to--

588
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:45,600
I thought
you were in Rome.

589
01:14:50,500 --> 01:14:52,400
How'd you escape?

590
01:14:55,100 --> 01:14:57,100
I jumped out of the cart...

591
01:14:57,200 --> 01:14:59,300
and Batiatus was so fat--

592
01:15:10,300 --> 01:15:13,000
I flew out of the cart...

593
01:15:14,300 --> 01:15:16,800
and Batiatus was so fat...

594
01:15:16,900 --> 01:15:19,000
that he couldn't catch me.

595
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:22,000
He couldn't catch up with me.

596
01:15:22,700 --> 01:15:24,800
Do you realize...

597
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:27,900
nobody can ever sell you again?

598
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,100
Nobody can sell you.

599
01:15:30,100 --> 01:15:32,400
- Or give you away.
- Or give you away.

600
01:15:32,500 --> 01:15:34,700
Nobody can ever make you
stay with anybody.

601
01:15:34,700 --> 01:15:37,700
Nobody can make you
stay with anybody.

602
01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:43,000
I love you, Spartacus.

603
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:49,500
I love you.

604
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:55,200
I still can't believe it.

605
01:15:57,100 --> 01:16:01,200
Forbid me ever to leave you.

606
01:16:07,100 --> 01:16:09,200
I do forbid you.

607
01:16:10,700 --> 01:16:12,700
I forbid you.

608
01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:46,100
It was funny at the time.
I wish he'd heard it.

609
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:48,500
How good you are to me,
if I may say so.

610
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:51,100
- You may.
- Thank you.

611
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:53,300
Don't just eye those birds.
Eat them.

612
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:56,300
There's no need to be
on your best behaviour here.

613
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:59,000
May I remind you...

614
01:16:59,100 --> 01:17:01,200
you've been very good to me
in the past?

615
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:03,300
I've been good to you?

616
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:09,300
Yes. You've sold me slaves
at an extremely reasonable price.

617
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:13,500
And you arranged private gladiatorial
jousts at cost, or practically.

618
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:15,900
On the whole, you are both
ethical in business matters...

619
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:19,900
and certainly farsighted socially.

620
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,300
Zenobia's put on a little weight
since I last saw her.

621
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:25,500
- Yes, hasn't she? I like it.
- So do l.

622
01:17:26,700 --> 01:17:29,000
You and I have a tendency
towards corpulence.

623
01:17:29,100 --> 01:17:32,900
Corpulence makes a man reasonable,
pleasant and phlegmatic.

624
01:17:32,900 --> 01:17:37,300
Have you noticed the nastiest
of tyrants are invariably thin?

625
01:17:38,700 --> 01:17:43,000
In spite of your vices, you are
the most generous Roman of our time.

626
01:17:43,100 --> 01:17:45,200
Vices?

627
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:48,400
The ladies.

628
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:54,000
Ladies!
Since when are they a vice?

629
01:17:54,100 --> 01:17:57,900
Perhaps I used the wrong word.
An eccentricity, a foible.

630
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,400
I hope I pronounced that word--

631
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:03,500
It's well-known that even your groom
and your butler are women.

632
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:06,300
I'm the most virtuous man in Rome.

633
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:09,800
I keep these women
out of my respect for Roman morality.

634
01:18:09,900 --> 01:18:12,800
That morality, which has made
Rome strong enough to steal...

635
01:18:12,900 --> 01:18:15,000
two-thirds of the world
from its rightful owners...

636
01:18:15,100 --> 01:18:18,200
founded on the sanctity
of Roman marriage and family.

637
01:18:18,300 --> 01:18:20,400
I happen to like women.

638
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:22,900
I have a promiscuous nature...

639
01:18:22,900 --> 01:18:25,400
and, unlike these aristocrats,
I will not take a marriage vow...

640
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:27,700
which I know my nature
will prevent me from keeping.

641
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:31,400
You have too great a respect
for the purity of womankind.

642
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:33,600
Exactly.

643
01:18:33,700 --> 01:18:37,800
It must be tantalizing
to be surrounded by so much purity.

644
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:43,300
It is.

645
01:18:43,300 --> 01:18:47,600
Now, let's mix business with pleasure.
How may I help you?

646
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:52,500
Great Gracchus,
I find it difficult to hate...

647
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:54,600
but there's one man I can't think of
without fuming.

648
01:18:54,700 --> 01:18:56,600
- Who's that?
- Crassus.

649
01:18:56,600 --> 01:19:00,500
- You've grown ambitious in your hatred.
- Do you blame me?

650
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:03,100
There I was, better than
a millionaire in the morning...

651
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:05,300
and a penniless refugee
by nightfall...

652
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:07,600
with nothing but these rags
and my poor flesh to call my own.

653
01:19:07,700 --> 01:19:11,000
All because Crassus decides
to break his journey at Capua...

654
01:19:11,100 --> 01:19:14,400
with a couple of capricious,
over-painted nymphs!

655
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:18,700
These two daughters of Venus
had to taunt the gladiators...

656
01:19:18,700 --> 01:19:21,800
force them to fight to the death,
and before I knew what had happened...

657
01:19:21,900 --> 01:19:25,200
revolution on my hands!

658
01:19:25,300 --> 01:19:27,300
What revenge have you in mind?

659
01:19:28,900 --> 01:19:31,200
I sold Crassus this woman,
Varinia.

660
01:19:31,300 --> 01:19:35,100
- Whom?
- Varinia. May the gods give her wings.

661
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:38,300
There was no contract,
but she was clearly his slave...

662
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:40,500
as soon as
the deal was made.

663
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:43,000
Now she's off with Spartacus
killing people in their beds.

664
01:19:43,100 --> 01:19:47,300
And Crassus--
no mention of money, no!

665
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:49,500
You never offered me
this woman. Why not ?

666
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:53,500
Well, she's not remotely
your type, Gracchus.

667
01:19:53,500 --> 01:19:56,900
- She is very thin and--
- Look around you.

668
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:00,100
You'll see women of all sizes.

669
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:04,200
Five hundred sesterces
deposit on Varinia.

670
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:06,900
Since he hasn't paid,
this gives me first call over Crassus...

671
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,100
when she's caught and auctioned.

672
01:20:09,200 --> 01:20:12,100
May the gods adore you!

673
01:20:12,100 --> 01:20:14,200
Why would you buy a woman
you've never even seen?

674
01:20:14,300 --> 01:20:16,300
To annoy Crassus, of course,
and to help you.

675
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:26,500
Fetch a stool, Antoninus.

676
01:20:32,700 --> 01:20:34,700
In here with it.

677
01:20:41,300 --> 01:20:43,200
That will do.

678
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:51,800
Do you steal, Antoninus?

679
01:20:51,900 --> 01:20:53,800
No, master.

680
01:20:54,300 --> 01:20:56,400
Do you lie?

681
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:58,900
Not if I can avoid it.

682
01:21:00,200 --> 01:21:03,600
Have you ever
dishonoured the gods?

683
01:21:03,700 --> 01:21:05,600
No, master.

684
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:11,200
Do you refrain from these vices
out of respect for the moral virtues?

685
01:21:11,300 --> 01:21:13,200
Yes, master.

686
01:21:16,900 --> 01:21:19,300
Do you eat oysters?

687
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:21,500
When I have them, master.

688
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:24,300
Do you eat snails?

689
01:21:24,900 --> 01:21:26,800
No, master.

690
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:30,600
Do you consider the eating
of oysters to be moral...

691
01:21:30,700 --> 01:21:33,300
and the eating of snails
to be immoral?

692
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:37,400
No, master.

693
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:39,600
Of course not.

694
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:45,200
It is all a matter
of taste, isn't it?

695
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:47,100
Yes, master.

696
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:51,100
And taste is not
the same as appetite...

697
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:54,700
and therefore not a question
of morals, is it?

698
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:03,000
It could be argued so, master.

699
01:22:05,800 --> 01:22:08,900
That will do.
My robe, Antoninus.

700
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:27,300
My taste includes...

701
01:22:28,300 --> 01:22:31,100
both snails and oysters.

702
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,100
Antoninus, look.

703
01:22:43,100 --> 01:22:45,200
Across the river.

704
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,300
There is something
you must see.

705
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:55,800
There, boy, is Rome!

706
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:59,600
The might, the majesty...

707
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:02,700
the terror of Rome.

708
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:09,300
There is the power that bestrides
the known world like a colossus.

709
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:12,600
No man can withstand Rome.

710
01:23:13,700 --> 01:23:15,900
No nation can withstand her.

711
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:19,500
How much less...

712
01:23:20,100 --> 01:23:22,000
a boy!

713
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:31,500
There's only one way to deal
with Rome, Antoninus.

714
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:34,900
You must serve her.

715
01:23:36,200 --> 01:23:39,300
You must abase yourself
before her.

716
01:23:41,200 --> 01:23:43,800
You must grovel at her feet.

717
01:23:45,700 --> 01:23:47,600
You must...

718
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:50,300
love her.

719
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,100
Isn't that so, Antoninus?

720
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:41,700
- Take your time!
- How are they coming?

721
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:45,200
Good. Give me another thousand like them
and we can march on Rome.

722
01:25:45,300 --> 01:25:47,400
Come on, once again.

723
01:26:02,900 --> 01:26:04,900
Here on Vesuvius,
we're safe from attack...

724
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,600
while we organize ourselves
into an army.

725
01:26:07,700 --> 01:26:10,500
It may take six months.
It may take a year. We don't know.

726
01:26:10,600 --> 01:26:14,000
Once we're strong, we're gonna fight
our way south to the sea.

727
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:17,000
We're going to arrange for ships
with the Cilician pirates.

728
01:26:17,100 --> 01:26:20,300
Then the sea will be a road
back home for all of us.

729
01:26:20,300 --> 01:26:22,700
If you agree, you may join us.

730
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:26,700
If you don't agree, go back
before your escape is discovered.

731
01:26:28,100 --> 01:26:30,100
Too many women.

732
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:32,300
What's wrong with women?

733
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:34,600
Where would you be now,
you lout...

734
01:26:34,600 --> 01:26:36,900
if some woman hadn't fought
all the pains of hell...

735
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,100
to get you
into this accursed world?

736
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:42,300
I can handle a knife
in the dark as well as anyone.

737
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:44,600
I can cast spells
and brew poisons.

738
01:26:44,700 --> 01:26:48,300
I have made the death shrouds
for seven Roman masters in my time.

739
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:52,300
- You lout! I want to see Spartacus.
- All right, grandmother.

740
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:55,100
I'm Spartacus. Stay with us.

741
01:26:55,200 --> 01:26:58,000
We'll need a million Roman shrouds
before we're through.

742
01:27:01,100 --> 01:27:03,200
Where do you people come from?

743
01:27:03,300 --> 01:27:06,100
Most of us come
from the estate of Lillius.

744
01:27:06,200 --> 01:27:09,500
- What kind of work did you do there?
- Sixteen years a carpenter and mason.

745
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:12,400
Good. We can use carpenters.

746
01:27:14,200 --> 01:27:16,600
- What kind of work did you do?
- I was a chief steward.

747
01:27:16,700 --> 01:27:20,400
You'll help with the food supplies.
You'll report to the man Patullus.

748
01:27:20,500 --> 01:27:22,600
What kind of work did you do?

749
01:27:23,400 --> 01:27:25,500
Singer of songs.

750
01:27:26,600 --> 01:27:30,700
Singer of songs?
But what work did you do?

751
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:33,700
That's my work.
I also juggle.

752
01:27:33,800 --> 01:27:36,400
Juggle. What else do you do?

753
01:27:36,500 --> 01:27:38,800
I can do feats of magic.

754
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:41,200
Magic?

755
01:27:41,300 --> 01:27:43,800
Maybe he can make
the Romans disappear.

756
01:29:11,300 --> 01:29:16,000
I'll need one volunteer,
man or woman. How about you?

757
01:29:16,900 --> 01:29:19,100
Here we have a likely subject.

758
01:29:20,600 --> 01:29:23,800
You'll notice there is
nothing in my hand, true?

759
01:29:23,900 --> 01:29:25,900
- How many fingers do you see?
- Three.

760
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,200
- How many fingers do you see?
- Three!

761
01:29:28,200 --> 01:29:30,300
I make a bowl.

762
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:33,200
My hand is upside down,
and I ask you to blow at it.

763
01:29:33,300 --> 01:29:35,500
No, not hard enough. Hard!

764
01:29:36,600 --> 01:29:38,500
Thank you.

765
01:29:45,500 --> 01:29:47,600
Would you like to try?

766
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,600
Hit it against the rock, gently.

767
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:04,900
Poet, I haven't had
an egg in days.

768
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,200
You haven't?

769
01:30:10,200 --> 01:30:12,400
- Here.
- Thank you.

770
01:30:12,500 --> 01:30:14,600
I'm not going
to let mine get away.

771
01:30:34,900 --> 01:30:38,100
- Sing us a song.
- Sing us a song, Antoninus.

772
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,100
Sing, Antoninus.

773
01:30:43,700 --> 01:30:47,000
When the blazing sun
hangs low in the western sky...

774
01:30:49,100 --> 01:30:51,800
when the wind dies away
on the mountain...

775
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:57,500
when the song
of the meadow lark turns still...

776
01:31:00,200 --> 01:31:03,300
when the field locust clicks
no more in the field...

777
01:31:05,300 --> 01:31:09,000
and the sea foam sleeps
like a maiden at rest...

778
01:31:09,100 --> 01:31:13,000
and twilight touches the shape
of the wandering earth...

779
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,800
I turn home.

780
01:31:15,900 --> 01:31:19,200
Through blue shadows
and purple woods...

781
01:31:19,300 --> 01:31:21,100
I turn home.

782
01:31:22,500 --> 01:31:25,000
I turn to the place
that I was born...

783
01:31:25,100 --> 01:31:29,000
to the mother who bore me
and the father who taught me...

784
01:31:29,100 --> 01:31:31,600
Long ago, long ago...

785
01:31:31,700 --> 01:31:33,900
Long ago.

786
01:31:35,100 --> 01:31:39,500
Alone am l now, lost and alone,
in a far, wide, wandering world.

787
01:31:41,200 --> 01:31:44,500
Yet still when
the blazing sun hangs low...

788
01:31:46,700 --> 01:31:50,000
when the wind dies away
and the sea foam sleeps...

789
01:31:51,300 --> 01:31:54,200
and twilight touches
the wandering earth...

790
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,300
I turn home.

791
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:05,800
Where'd you learn that song?

792
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:08,900
My father taught it to me.

793
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:12,000
I was wrong about you, poet.

794
01:32:12,100 --> 01:32:14,200
You won't learn to kill.
You'll teach us songs.

795
01:32:14,300 --> 01:32:16,500
I came here to fight.

796
01:32:18,200 --> 01:32:21,100
Anyone can learn to fight.

797
01:32:21,200 --> 01:32:23,200
I joined to fight!

798
01:32:26,700 --> 01:32:29,800
- What's your name?
- Antoninus.

799
01:32:33,900 --> 01:32:37,600
There's a time for fighting,
and there's a time for singing.

800
01:32:37,700 --> 01:32:40,100
Now you teach us to sing.

801
01:32:40,200 --> 01:32:42,300
Sing, Antoninus.

802
01:32:48,500 --> 01:32:52,400
When the blazing sun
hangs low in the western sky--

803
01:32:53,400 --> 01:32:55,500
You like him, don't you?

804
01:32:59,800 --> 01:33:01,900
Who wants to fight?

805
01:33:04,500 --> 01:33:07,000
An animal can learn to fight.

806
01:33:10,200 --> 01:33:13,000
But to sing beautiful things...

807
01:33:14,100 --> 01:33:16,200
and make people believe them--

808
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:28,500
What are you thinking about?

809
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,100
I'm free.

810
01:33:39,700 --> 01:33:41,800
And what do I know?

811
01:33:42,300 --> 01:33:44,300
I don't even know
how to read.

812
01:33:47,100 --> 01:33:49,400
You know things
that can't be taught.

813
01:33:52,100 --> 01:33:54,200
I know nothing.

814
01:33:54,600 --> 01:33:56,600
Nothing!

815
01:33:59,100 --> 01:34:01,100
And I want to know.

816
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:03,400
I want to--

817
01:34:05,300 --> 01:34:07,400
I want to know.

818
01:34:08,600 --> 01:34:10,500
Know what?

819
01:34:14,200 --> 01:34:15,800
Everything.

820
01:34:19,100 --> 01:34:22,700
Why a star falls
and a bird doesn't.

821
01:34:22,700 --> 01:34:25,500
Where the sun goes at night.

822
01:34:25,500 --> 01:34:28,000
Why the moon changes shape.

823
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:35,200
I want to know
where the wind comes from.

824
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:45,800
The wind begins in a cave.

825
01:34:45,900 --> 01:34:50,600
Far to the north,
a young god sleeps in that cave.

826
01:34:50,700 --> 01:34:53,000
He dreams of a girl...

827
01:34:53,100 --> 01:34:55,700
and he sighs...

828
01:34:55,700 --> 01:34:59,700
and the night wind
stirs with his breath.

829
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,800
I want to know all about you.

830
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
Every line...

831
01:35:16,900 --> 01:35:19,000
every curve.

832
01:35:22,200 --> 01:35:25,000
I want to know
every part of you.

833
01:35:27,700 --> 01:35:29,900
Every beat of your heart.

834
01:35:55,500 --> 01:35:58,300
Go on about the city
of Metapontum.

835
01:35:58,400 --> 01:36:00,700
What garrisons
will we find there?

836
01:36:02,200 --> 01:36:05,300
There are two legions in the garrison.
Some have been sent south--

837
01:36:05,400 --> 01:36:07,500
Set the litter down there.

838
01:36:23,900 --> 01:36:27,500
Where is this slave general?

839
01:36:31,300 --> 01:36:33,700
Dionysius, get the litter bearers
out of the rain.

840
01:36:33,800 --> 01:36:36,400
Give them food, bread,
and their freedom.

841
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,300
- All right, follow me.
- We'll pay you for them.

842
01:36:41,200 --> 01:36:44,200
We have no slaves
in this camp.

843
01:36:49,200 --> 01:36:51,600
Tigranes Levantus at your service.

844
01:36:52,200 --> 01:36:54,300
My credentials.

845
01:36:58,900 --> 01:37:00,800
Come in.

846
01:37:03,400 --> 01:37:06,000
"To the general of the Italian slaves
called Spartacus...

847
01:37:06,100 --> 01:37:09,300
from Ibar M'hali, Cilician governor
of the island of Delos."

848
01:37:09,400 --> 01:37:11,400
- Sit down.
- "Greetings.

849
01:37:11,500 --> 01:37:14,100
Word has been received that you wish
to embark your armies...

850
01:37:14,200 --> 01:37:18,300
on the Cilician ships
from the Italian port of Brundusium.

851
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:21,500
- Receive now my agent, Tigranes--"
- Levantus.

852
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:23,900
"who bargains in my name.

853
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:28,000
May Isis and Serapis bring victory
to your cause. The governor of Delos."

854
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:31,400
- Who are Isis and Serapis?
- Gods of the east.

855
01:37:31,500 --> 01:37:34,500
Why should they want us to win?

856
01:37:35,800 --> 01:37:38,100
Because they favour Cilicia...

857
01:37:38,100 --> 01:37:40,200
and Cilicia, like you,
fights against the Romans.

858
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,400
Would you like some wine?

859
01:37:47,500 --> 01:37:50,600
I drink only after the bargain
has been concluded...

860
01:37:50,700 --> 01:37:52,700
never before.

861
01:38:00,100 --> 01:38:02,700
How many ships
do these Cilicians have?

862
01:38:02,700 --> 01:38:05,000
Five hundred at least.

863
01:38:05,100 --> 01:38:07,200
But no deal is too small,
I assure you.

864
01:38:07,300 --> 01:38:09,500
We'll need them all.

865
01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:12,500
- All?
- What is the price?

866
01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:18,300
Price is 1 00,000 sesterces
per ship.

867
01:38:19,300 --> 01:38:22,000
For 500 ships that would be...

868
01:38:23,100 --> 01:38:25,700
50 million sesterces.

869
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:31,400
- You have such a sum?
- We will have.

870
01:38:34,900 --> 01:38:37,000
See for yourself.

871
01:38:40,100 --> 01:38:42,700
- Beautiful.
- When will the ships be ready?

872
01:38:42,800 --> 01:38:46,900
Beautiful.
I love to see such beauty.

873
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,100
When will the ships be ready?

874
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,100
My friend...

875
01:38:52,200 --> 01:38:54,800
when will you be ready?

876
01:38:54,900 --> 01:38:57,300
How long will it take you...

877
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,100
to cross one-third
the length of Italy...

878
01:39:01,200 --> 01:39:03,800
fighting a major battle
in every town?

879
01:39:03,800 --> 01:39:06,300
One year? Two years?

880
01:39:06,400 --> 01:39:08,500
If we're not in Brundusium
seven months from now...

881
01:39:08,600 --> 01:39:11,000
we'll never be there.

882
01:39:13,100 --> 01:39:15,100
What if we assemble the ships...

883
01:39:16,700 --> 01:39:20,600
and there is no longer
a slave army to board them?

884
01:39:20,700 --> 01:39:24,200
We'll give you a chest of treasure now,
the rest when we get to Brundusium.

885
01:39:25,100 --> 01:39:27,400
- This one?
- Yes.

886
01:39:28,700 --> 01:39:32,100
Done! Seven months from now,
the ships will be assembled.

887
01:39:34,400 --> 01:39:37,300
Arrange to have the chest loaded.

888
01:39:37,300 --> 01:39:41,200
Now, with your permission, I should
like to have the wine you offered me.

889
01:39:41,300 --> 01:39:43,300
- Will you join me?
- I will.

890
01:39:43,400 --> 01:39:45,300
Excellent workmanship.

891
01:39:45,400 --> 01:39:47,800
It came from the estate
of a wealthy nobleman.

892
01:39:47,900 --> 01:39:50,900
I've heard that you are
of noble birth yourself.

893
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,200
I'm the son
and grandson of slaves.

894
01:39:53,300 --> 01:39:57,300
I knew that
when I saw you couldn't read.

895
01:39:57,400 --> 01:40:01,200
Of course, it pleases Roman vanity
to think that you are noble.

896
01:40:01,300 --> 01:40:03,900
They shrink from the idea
of fighting mere slaves...

897
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,200
especially a man like Crassus.

898
01:40:07,800 --> 01:40:12,600
- You know him?
- I entertained him one afternoon.

899
01:40:12,700 --> 01:40:15,100
- You?
- In the arena.

900
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,100
Excellent wine.

901
01:40:23,300 --> 01:40:26,400
- May I ask you something?
- You can ask.

902
01:40:26,500 --> 01:40:30,000
Surely you know
you're going to lose, don't you?

903
01:40:31,400 --> 01:40:33,300
You have no chance.

904
01:40:33,400 --> 01:40:36,000
At this very moment, six cohorts
of the garrison of Rome...

905
01:40:36,100 --> 01:40:38,300
are approaching this position.

906
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:44,000
What are you going to do?

907
01:40:48,200 --> 01:40:50,700
We'll decide that
when they get here.

908
01:40:55,200 --> 01:40:57,300
Let me put it differently.

909
01:40:57,400 --> 01:41:00,700
If you looked
into a magic crystal...

910
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:05,000
and you saw your army destroyed
and yourself dead...

911
01:41:05,100 --> 01:41:07,800
if you saw that in the future...

912
01:41:07,900 --> 01:41:09,900
as I'm sure
you're seeing it now...

913
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
would you continue to fight?

914
01:41:13,500 --> 01:41:15,800
- Yes.
- Knowing that you must lose?

915
01:41:17,900 --> 01:41:20,800
Knowing we can.

916
01:41:20,900 --> 01:41:24,100
All men lose when they die
and all men die.

917
01:41:24,100 --> 01:41:26,700
But a slave and a free man
lose different things.

918
01:41:26,800 --> 01:41:28,600
They both lose life.

919
01:41:28,800 --> 01:41:32,600
When a free man dies,
he loses the pleasure of life.

920
01:41:33,700 --> 01:41:36,200
A slave loses his pain.

921
01:41:37,500 --> 01:41:40,500
Death is the only freedom
a slave knows.

922
01:41:40,600 --> 01:41:42,700
That's why he's not afraid of it.

923
01:41:44,800 --> 01:41:46,100
That's why we'll win.

924
01:42:15,400 --> 01:42:18,200
Spartacus,
that pirate was right.

925
01:42:20,100 --> 01:42:23,000
The garrison of Rome,
they're setting up camp.

926
01:42:24,200 --> 01:42:26,500
- How many are there?
- About six cohorts.

927
01:42:27,600 --> 01:42:29,700
- Where?
- At the mouth of the valley...

928
01:42:29,800 --> 01:42:31,900
against the cliffs.

929
01:42:33,800 --> 01:42:37,300
- Strong camp?
- They have no stockade.

930
01:42:39,100 --> 01:42:42,000
No stockade? Are you sure?

931
01:42:42,100 --> 01:42:46,100
- I'm very sure.
- This campaign is great sport for them.

932
01:42:46,200 --> 01:42:48,300
The Romans are having a picnic.

933
01:42:49,400 --> 01:42:52,200
- Did they see you?
- No! We were hidden.

934
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,400
Maybe we ought to join
this Roman picnic.

935
01:42:57,500 --> 01:42:59,700
Form your men.

936
01:43:05,300 --> 01:43:07,200
Six cohorts.

937
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,900
A lot of arms and weapons...

938
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,100
to build our army with.

939
01:43:40,500 --> 01:43:43,300
Crixus always wanted
to march on Rome.

940
01:43:44,100 --> 01:43:46,200
Now he doesn't have to.

941
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,100
Rome's come to us.

942
01:44:55,100 --> 01:44:57,800
Half this way!
The rest over there.

943
01:45:18,300 --> 01:45:21,900
Stand up, the way
a noble Roman should!

944
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
That's Roman pride for you!

945
01:45:30,700 --> 01:45:32,600
That's better.

946
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:34,800
What's your name?

947
01:45:36,300 --> 01:45:38,900
Marcus Glabrus.

948
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,600
Commander of the garrison
of Rome!

949
01:45:43,700 --> 01:45:45,000
Commander?

950
01:45:45,100 --> 01:45:49,100
He was commanding it on his belly
when we found him, playing dead!

951
01:45:52,700 --> 01:45:55,900
You disappoint me,
Marcus Glabrus.

952
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,100
Playing dead.

953
01:45:59,300 --> 01:46:01,400
You afraid to die?

954
01:46:02,900 --> 01:46:05,100
It's easy to die.

955
01:46:05,200 --> 01:46:07,600
Haven't you seen
enough gladiators in the arena...

956
01:46:07,700 --> 01:46:09,700
to see how easy it is to die?

957
01:46:09,800 --> 01:46:12,200
Of course you have.

958
01:46:14,600 --> 01:46:16,900
What are you going
to do to me?

959
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,100
I don't know.

960
01:46:20,200 --> 01:46:24,500
- What should we do with him?
- Let's have a matched pair, him and me.

961
01:46:26,500 --> 01:46:28,900
I'll not fight like a gladiator!

962
01:46:33,900 --> 01:46:36,600
You keep staring at this.

963
01:46:36,700 --> 01:46:38,800
Do you recognize this baton?

964
01:46:39,900 --> 01:46:43,500
- Yes!
- You should! It was in your tent.

965
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,100
The symbol of the senate.

966
01:46:48,200 --> 01:46:50,700
All the power of Rome!

967
01:46:52,400 --> 01:46:54,200
That's the power of Rome!

968
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,400
Take that back to your senate.

969
01:47:00,500 --> 01:47:04,500
Tell them you and that broken stick is
all that's left of the garrison of Rome!

970
01:47:04,600 --> 01:47:07,400
Tell them we want nothing
from Rome.

971
01:47:07,500 --> 01:47:10,100
Nothing except our freedom!

972
01:47:10,200 --> 01:47:13,100
All we want is to get out
of this damn country!

973
01:47:13,200 --> 01:47:15,300
We're marching south
to the sea.

974
01:47:15,400 --> 01:47:17,900
And we'll smash every army
they send against us.

975
01:47:17,900 --> 01:47:20,400
Put him on a horse!

976
01:50:19,400 --> 01:50:23,300
Their leader said
their hatred of Rome was such...

977
01:50:23,400 --> 01:50:26,500
that all they wished
was to escape from her rule.

978
01:50:26,600 --> 01:50:30,700
If unopposed, he promised
a peaceful march to the sea.

979
01:50:30,700 --> 01:50:34,200
If opposed, he threatens
to ravage the countryside...

980
01:50:34,200 --> 01:50:36,500
and destroy every legion
sent against him.

981
01:50:36,600 --> 01:50:38,700
And once they get to the sea?

982
01:50:38,700 --> 01:50:42,800
They plan to take ship with Cilician
pirates and return to their homes.

983
01:50:42,800 --> 01:50:45,500
From which port do they
propose to embark?

984
01:50:45,500 --> 01:50:47,500
I don't know.

985
01:50:47,600 --> 01:50:50,400
But city garrisons
can't stand up to them.

986
01:50:50,500 --> 01:50:53,200
If they are to be intercepted,
it's work for the legions!

987
01:50:53,300 --> 01:50:57,200
What sort of a man is
this leader of the slaves?

988
01:50:57,300 --> 01:50:59,300
I don't know.

989
01:50:59,400 --> 01:51:01,600
I think they called him
Spartacus.

990
01:51:04,900 --> 01:51:07,000
Is that name familiar to you?

991
01:51:09,400 --> 01:51:12,300
Yes, it does seem to be.

992
01:51:12,400 --> 01:51:14,200
I can't place it.

993
01:51:14,300 --> 01:51:16,500
After he talked to you,
what happened then?

994
01:51:18,100 --> 01:51:21,300
I was tied to a horse
and lashed out of camp.

995
01:51:23,200 --> 01:51:26,400
How many of your company
escaped?

996
01:51:26,500 --> 01:51:28,800
Fourteen have reported
thus far.

997
01:51:28,800 --> 01:51:31,800
I myself was taken prisoner
in my own command tent.

998
01:51:31,800 --> 01:51:36,100
The camp was thoroughly infiltrated
before an alarm could be sounded.

999
01:51:37,300 --> 01:51:41,700
Did you surround your camp
with moat and stockade?

1000
01:51:49,100 --> 01:51:50,100
No.

1001
01:51:52,200 --> 01:51:56,300
We arrived after sunset.
Sentries were posted every ten paces.

1002
01:51:56,400 --> 01:51:59,900
There was no reason to expect
an attack by night.

1003
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:03,200
Then again, well, they--

1004
01:52:05,500 --> 01:52:07,200
Continue.

1005
01:52:09,800 --> 01:52:11,900
They were only slaves.

1006
01:52:14,900 --> 01:52:16,300
I see.

1007
01:52:19,300 --> 01:52:23,600
I submit that Publius Marcus Glabrus
has disgraced the arms of Rome.

1008
01:52:24,900 --> 01:52:27,500
Let the punishment
of the senate be pronounced.

1009
01:52:32,600 --> 01:52:35,900
If we punished every commander
who made a fool of himself...

1010
01:52:35,900 --> 01:52:39,000
we wouldn't have anyone left
above the rank of centurion.

1011
01:52:40,700 --> 01:52:43,500
But this is a case
of criminal carelessness!

1012
01:52:43,500 --> 01:52:46,900
Six cohorts have been slaughtered.

1013
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,400
Crassus sponsored this young man.

1014
01:52:49,500 --> 01:52:51,600
Let him pronounce sentence.

1015
01:52:55,100 --> 01:52:57,200
The punishment is well-known!

1016
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,100
Let Publius Marcus Glabrus
be denied...

1017
01:53:02,200 --> 01:53:04,300
fire, water,
food and shelter...

1018
01:53:04,400 --> 01:53:07,800
for a distance of 400 miles
in all directions from the city of Rome.

1019
01:53:12,800 --> 01:53:15,000
One thing more.

1020
01:53:15,100 --> 01:53:19,000
Glabrus is my friend, and I will not
dissociate myself from his disgrace.

1021
01:53:19,100 --> 01:53:22,200
I now lay down the command
of my legions...

1022
01:53:22,300 --> 01:53:24,300
and retire to private life.

1023
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:38,900
Good-bye, Crassus.

1024
01:53:40,800 --> 01:53:44,500
This is no time for a man of honour
to withdraw from public affairs!

1025
01:53:44,600 --> 01:53:47,600
- Shame, shame!
- Sit down.

1026
01:53:48,300 --> 01:53:51,800
This sort of heroic
public behaviour is nothing new!

1027
01:53:51,800 --> 01:53:54,400
I've seen it before-- we all have--
and I know the meaning of it!

1028
01:53:54,500 --> 01:53:58,900
- Crassus acted on a point of honour!
- Patrician honour!

1029
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,100
No matter how noble
this looks from the outside...

1030
01:54:01,100 --> 01:54:03,200
I don't like the colour of it.

1031
01:54:03,300 --> 01:54:05,400
Crassus is
the only man in Rome...

1032
01:54:05,500 --> 01:54:09,500
who hasn't yielded to
republican corruption, and never will!

1033
01:54:09,600 --> 01:54:13,600
I'll take some republican corruption
along with some republican freedom...

1034
01:54:13,700 --> 01:54:15,600
but I won't take...

1035
01:54:15,700 --> 01:54:20,200
the dictatorship of Crassus
and no freedom at all!

1036
01:54:22,400 --> 01:54:24,700
That's what he's out for...

1037
01:54:24,800 --> 01:54:26,900
and that's why he'll be back.

1038
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:21,100
To the mother that bore me...

1039
01:58:22,400 --> 01:58:24,600
to the father that taught me...

1040
01:58:26,800 --> 01:58:28,900
to the god--

1041
01:58:31,600 --> 01:58:34,900
To the blue woods
and the purple shadows, l--

1042
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:38,500
To blue shadows
and purple woods.

1043
01:58:38,500 --> 01:58:42,400
- Spartacus, you frightened me!
- I'm sorry.

1044
01:58:44,600 --> 01:58:47,300
- How long have you been there?
- A little while.

1045
01:58:48,400 --> 01:58:50,500
Why didn't you say something?

1046
01:58:50,500 --> 01:58:52,700
You seemed so happy.
I didn't want to bother you.

1047
01:58:52,800 --> 01:58:54,900
I am happy.

1048
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:59,100
Spartacus, I've been trying to remember
the song that Antoninus sang.

1049
01:58:59,100 --> 01:59:01,500
Is it blue shadows
and purple woods?

1050
01:59:01,600 --> 01:59:04,600
Or is it purple woods
and blue shadows, or what is it?

1051
01:59:04,700 --> 01:59:07,000
I want to make love
to my wife!

1052
01:59:09,500 --> 01:59:11,500
Spartacus, put me down. I'm--

1053
01:59:11,600 --> 01:59:13,500
I don't care.

1054
01:59:13,600 --> 01:59:16,400
- You've got, you've--
- Yes?

1055
01:59:16,400 --> 01:59:19,700
- You have to be gentle with me.
- Why?

1056
01:59:19,800 --> 01:59:21,700
Why, darling?

1057
01:59:21,700 --> 01:59:25,000
I'm going to have a baby.
Now put me down.

1058
01:59:27,600 --> 01:59:29,200
What?

1059
01:59:31,700 --> 01:59:34,000
A baby.

1060
01:59:37,700 --> 01:59:39,800
A baby? When?

1061
01:59:42,400 --> 01:59:43,800
In the spring.

1062
01:59:46,400 --> 01:59:51,100
- How? I mean, how do you know?
- I know.

1063
01:59:52,200 --> 01:59:54,300
A baby in the spring.

1064
01:59:56,500 --> 01:59:59,100
- I'm gonna have a son.
- But it might be a daughter.

1065
01:59:59,200 --> 02:00:01,400
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I just did.

1066
02:00:01,500 --> 02:00:04,000
You're cold.
Here, get underneath this.

1067
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:07,100
- Did I hurt you?
- No, you didn't.

1068
02:00:07,200 --> 02:00:10,200
- I didn't mean to be so rough.
- Why don't you kiss me?

1069
02:00:10,300 --> 02:00:13,100
This is the first time
I was ever going to have a baby.

1070
02:00:18,600 --> 02:00:20,900
A baby.

1071
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:24,200
I'm just the same
as I ever was, Spartacus.

1072
02:00:34,300 --> 02:00:36,400
I won't break.

1073
02:01:05,600 --> 02:01:10,000
These slaves have already cost us
a thousand million sesterces.

1074
02:01:10,100 --> 02:01:13,000
If now they want to relieve us
of their unwelcome presence...

1075
02:01:13,100 --> 02:01:15,200
in the name of all the gods,
let them go!

1076
02:01:15,300 --> 02:01:18,600
Impossible! They've already infected
half of Italy with this uprising.

1077
02:01:18,700 --> 02:01:20,500
If we permit them
to escape now...

1078
02:01:20,600 --> 02:01:23,100
this condition will spread
throughout the entire empire.

1079
02:01:29,800 --> 02:01:33,000
The Republic...

1080
02:01:33,100 --> 02:01:36,400
is still weak
from 20 years of civil strife.

1081
02:01:36,500 --> 02:01:39,400
We're engaged in two wars:

1082
02:01:39,500 --> 02:01:42,900
one in Spain
and the other in Asia.

1083
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:47,000
Pirates have cut off
our Egyptian grain supply...

1084
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:51,800
and Spartacus raids the commerce
of all south Italy.

1085
02:01:51,900 --> 02:01:56,700
Half the precincts of Rome
are without bread!

1086
02:01:56,800 --> 02:01:59,600
The city is close to panic.

1087
02:02:00,900 --> 02:02:03,900
There are two things
we must do immediately!

1088
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:07,800
Confirm Caesar as permanent
commander of the garrison...

1089
02:02:11,800 --> 02:02:14,000
and assign two legions...

1090
02:02:14,100 --> 02:02:19,400
to intercept and destroy Spartacus
at the city of Metapontum!

1091
02:03:25,600 --> 02:03:28,000
If we could only have had
Batiatus in the other pot!

1092
02:03:28,100 --> 02:03:31,600
- Now you're talking!
- Varinia, wonderful meal.

1093
02:03:32,500 --> 02:03:36,200
A small piece of land
with a few goats on it.

1094
02:03:37,900 --> 02:03:39,900
The best wine in the world.

1095
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:44,500
For wine you've got to go to Aquitania.
The sweetest grapes on earth.

1096
02:03:44,600 --> 02:03:47,900
Come to Lidya for wine.
That's the best.

1097
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:52,000
The best wine comes from Greece.
Everybody knows that. Even the Romans!

1098
02:03:52,100 --> 02:03:54,700
No, Lidya!

1099
02:03:55,600 --> 02:03:58,300
You're all wrong!

1100
02:03:58,400 --> 02:04:00,800
The best wine comes from home,
wherever it is.

1101
02:04:00,800 --> 02:04:02,700
I agree with you.

1102
02:04:24,500 --> 02:04:26,400
Gentlemen.

1103
02:04:26,800 --> 02:04:30,000
- Are there reports on Metapontum?
- Heralds are crying the news now.

1104
02:04:30,100 --> 02:04:33,400
We lost 1 9,000 men,
including Commodius and his officers.

1105
02:04:33,500 --> 02:04:35,700
Nineteen thousand?

1106
02:04:37,800 --> 02:04:40,000
Have you estates in Metapontum?

1107
02:04:40,100 --> 02:04:43,300
No. A son with Commodius.

1108
02:04:44,300 --> 02:04:46,500
With your permission, good day.

1109
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:52,500
We take five years
to train a legion.

1110
02:04:52,600 --> 02:04:56,800
How can this Spartacus
train an army in seven months?

1111
02:04:56,900 --> 02:05:00,300
There's something wrong,
something very wrong.

1112
02:05:00,400 --> 02:05:03,400
- We should have an investigation.
- By all means, an investigation.

1113
02:05:03,400 --> 02:05:07,700
-Where is Spartacus now?
-He's nearing the seaport of Brundusium.

1114
02:05:07,800 --> 02:05:10,500
I need a few moments
of the commander's time.

1115
02:05:10,600 --> 02:05:12,700
Will you excuse us?

1116
02:05:17,600 --> 02:05:22,600
I hear you've taken a house
in the fourth ward.

1117
02:05:22,800 --> 02:05:25,300
Not a very splendid house either.

1118
02:05:25,300 --> 02:05:28,100
And you feasted 1 1 ,000 plebeians
in the field of Mars.

1119
02:05:28,200 --> 02:05:30,400
It scarcely could've
been called a feast.

1120
02:05:31,500 --> 02:05:33,500
For 200 years, your family
and mine have been members...

1121
02:05:33,600 --> 02:05:36,800
of the Equestrian Order
and the Patrician Party.

1122
02:05:36,900 --> 02:05:39,900
Servants and rulers of Rome.

1123
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,400
Why have you left us
for Gracchus and the mob?

1124
02:05:42,500 --> 02:05:45,600
I've left no one,
least of all Rome.

1125
02:05:45,700 --> 02:05:49,500
But this much I've learned
from Gracchus: Rome is the mob.

1126
02:05:49,600 --> 02:05:51,700
No!

1127
02:05:51,800 --> 02:05:55,400
Rome is an eternal thought
in the mind of God.

1128
02:05:55,500 --> 02:05:57,600
I had no idea
you'd grown religious.

1129
02:05:58,200 --> 02:06:00,200
That doesn't matter.

1130
02:06:00,300 --> 02:06:02,700
If there were no gods at all,
I'd revere them.

1131
02:06:02,800 --> 02:06:06,100
If there were no Rome,
I'd dream of her...

1132
02:06:06,200 --> 02:06:08,300
as I want you to do.

1133
02:06:09,700 --> 02:06:12,100
I want you to come back
to your own kind.

1134
02:06:12,800 --> 02:06:14,700
I beg you to.

1135
02:06:15,500 --> 02:06:17,600
Is it me you want
or is it the garrison?

1136
02:06:19,100 --> 02:06:22,300
Both. Tell me frankly.

1137
02:06:22,400 --> 02:06:25,200
If you were l, would you
take the field against Spartacus?

1138
02:06:25,300 --> 02:06:27,400
- Of course.
- Why?

1139
02:06:27,500 --> 02:06:30,300
We have no other choice
if we're to save Rome.

1140
02:06:30,400 --> 02:06:32,100
Caesar!

1141
02:06:32,100 --> 02:06:33,800
Which Rome?

1142
02:06:33,900 --> 02:06:35,700
Theirs...

1143
02:06:35,700 --> 02:06:37,700
or ours?

1144
02:06:40,600 --> 02:06:43,100
You know Gracchus
is my friend.

1145
02:06:44,900 --> 02:06:47,000
I won't betray him.

1146
02:06:48,500 --> 02:06:50,300
Caesar.

1147
02:06:53,800 --> 02:06:56,500
Which is worse: to betray a friend
or to betray Rome herself?

1148
02:06:56,600 --> 02:06:58,800
My dear Crassus,
I face no such choice.

1149
02:06:58,900 --> 02:07:01,800
You will,
sooner than you think.

1150
02:07:03,400 --> 02:07:06,200
Good afternoon, Crassus.
I've been looking for you all day.

1151
02:07:06,300 --> 02:07:08,200
Your new master.

1152
02:07:11,300 --> 02:07:14,200
The senate's been in session all day
over this business of Spartacus.

1153
02:07:14,300 --> 02:07:18,100
We've got eight legions to march
against him and no one to lead them.

1154
02:07:18,100 --> 02:07:20,300
The minute you offer
the generals command...

1155
02:07:20,400 --> 02:07:22,600
they start wheezing
like winded mules.

1156
02:07:22,700 --> 02:07:25,100
I've seen such epidemics before,
haven't you?

1157
02:07:25,200 --> 02:07:27,500
- How's your health?
- Excellent, as you know.

1158
02:07:27,600 --> 02:07:30,200
I take it the senate's now offering
command of the legions to me.

1159
02:07:30,300 --> 02:07:32,700
- You've been expecting it.
- I have.

1160
02:07:32,800 --> 02:07:35,100
But have you thought how costly
my services might be?

1161
02:07:35,200 --> 02:07:37,500
We buy everything else
these days.

1162
02:07:37,600 --> 02:07:41,000
No reason why we shouldn't be charged
for patriotism. What's your fee?

1163
02:07:43,200 --> 02:07:47,900
My election as first consul,
command of all the legions of Italy...

1164
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,600
and the abolition of senatorial
authority over the courts.

1165
02:07:51,500 --> 02:07:53,600
Dictatorship.

1166
02:07:54,500 --> 02:07:56,100
Order.

1167
02:07:57,900 --> 02:08:00,200
- Advise me if my terms are acceptable.
- I can tell you now.

1168
02:08:00,300 --> 02:08:02,800
- They're unacceptable.
- Yes, I know.

1169
02:08:02,900 --> 02:08:06,300
For the present perhaps, but times
change, and so does the senate.

1170
02:08:06,400 --> 02:08:08,400
When that day comes,
I shall be ready.

1171
02:08:08,500 --> 02:08:10,800
- Convey my respects to your wife.
- With pleasure.

1172
02:08:13,600 --> 02:08:15,700
He's right, you know.

1173
02:08:15,800 --> 02:08:18,400
If something isn't done about Spartacus,
the senate will change.

1174
02:08:18,500 --> 02:08:21,200
And Crassus will move in
and save Rome from the slave army...

1175
02:08:21,200 --> 02:08:23,300
by assuming dictatorship.

1176
02:08:25,900 --> 02:08:29,000
But that, like everything else,
depends on which way Spartacus jumps.

1177
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:31,200
Just now, he's trying
to get out of Italy.

1178
02:08:31,300 --> 02:08:33,800
If he succeeds,
the crisis is over...

1179
02:08:33,900 --> 02:08:37,000
and Crassus may stay
in retirement indefinitely.

1180
02:08:37,100 --> 02:08:40,400
I've arranged for Spartacus
to escape from Italy.

1181
02:08:40,500 --> 02:08:41,800
You've done what?

1182
02:08:41,900 --> 02:08:45,100
I've made a little deal
with the Cilician pirates.

1183
02:08:45,100 --> 02:08:47,200
I've assured them
that we won't interfere...

1184
02:08:47,300 --> 02:08:50,200
if they transport Spartacus
and his slaves out of Italy.

1185
02:08:52,600 --> 02:08:57,000
So now we deal with pirates.
We bargain with criminals!

1186
02:08:57,100 --> 02:09:01,700
Don't you be so stiff-necked about it.
Politics is a practical profession.

1187
02:09:01,700 --> 02:09:06,000
If a criminal has what you want,
you do business with him.

1188
02:09:42,400 --> 02:09:45,100
How far are we from Brundusium?

1189
02:09:45,200 --> 02:09:47,700
About 20 miles.

1190
02:09:47,800 --> 02:09:51,800
Our army will have to camp here tonight.
They're still about six hours behind us.

1191
02:09:51,800 --> 02:09:56,000
Patullus, ride ahead to Brundusium.
Bring Tigranes here.

1192
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:58,900
Marco, report back to Spartacus.

1193
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:01,900
Tell him we camp tonight
by the sea!

1194
02:10:43,500 --> 02:10:47,500
If all goes well, my estimate is
we can load 1 50 ships a day.

1195
02:10:47,600 --> 02:10:50,400
That's your job, Dionysius.
Work with the Cilician pirates.

1196
02:10:50,500 --> 02:10:54,500
- That oughta keep him busy.
- Saves me finding someplace to sleep.

1197
02:10:54,600 --> 02:10:56,600
Crixus, keep giving me reports
on Pompey.

1198
02:10:56,700 --> 02:10:58,800
There won't be any surprises.

1199
02:10:58,900 --> 02:11:01,900
I still want patrols of
the back country until we board ship.

1200
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:03,900
I'll get them together now.

1201
02:11:03,900 --> 02:11:07,100
Spartacus, the harbour district
in Brundusium has food warehouses...

1202
02:11:07,200 --> 02:11:09,800
but not enough to provide
for the whole fleet.

1203
02:11:09,900 --> 02:11:11,800
The countryside's filled with cattle.

1204
02:11:11,900 --> 02:11:14,000
And we've more than enough salt
to preserve them.

1205
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:15,900
I'll handle it.

1206
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:19,500
Find out how many men we have in camp
who were galley slaves or sailors.

1207
02:11:19,600 --> 02:11:21,500
Tigranes Levantus.

1208
02:11:24,400 --> 02:11:26,500
- My dear general.
- Welcome, Tigranes!

1209
02:11:26,600 --> 02:11:30,100
No, no. You needn't look
for litter bearers to emancipate.

1210
02:11:30,100 --> 02:11:32,000
I rode a horse.

1211
02:11:32,100 --> 02:11:35,800
Your gods Isis and Serapis
must've been good to us.

1212
02:11:35,800 --> 02:11:39,800
The balance of the 50 million sesterces
we owe you.

1213
02:11:40,700 --> 02:11:42,800
General...

1214
02:11:42,900 --> 02:11:46,500
I bear a heavy burden
of evil tidings.

1215
02:11:48,700 --> 02:11:50,600
What is it?

1216
02:11:52,400 --> 02:11:55,800
Pompey and his army
has landed in Italy.

1217
02:11:55,900 --> 02:11:58,800
At the border of Rhegium
three days ago.

1218
02:11:58,900 --> 02:12:01,200
We get complete reports
on their movements.

1219
02:12:01,200 --> 02:12:03,200
But do you also know...

1220
02:12:03,300 --> 02:12:05,600
that a Roman fleet carrying
Lucullus and his army...

1221
02:12:05,700 --> 02:12:07,800
arrives tomorrow at Brundusium?

1222
02:12:10,400 --> 02:12:13,600
- Lucullus here?
- You have no ships.

1223
02:12:17,400 --> 02:12:19,500
I saw them in the harbour.

1224
02:12:21,100 --> 02:12:25,200
The Cilician fleet,
out of strategic necessity...

1225
02:12:25,300 --> 02:12:27,700
has been obliged to withdraw.

1226
02:12:28,900 --> 02:12:32,400
- Withdraw?
- There are no ships at all?

1227
02:12:40,500 --> 02:12:44,800
Cilician pirates can destroy
any Roman fleet that ever sailed.

1228
02:12:44,900 --> 02:12:47,000
If they run away now,
it's not because they're afraid!

1229
02:12:47,100 --> 02:12:49,200
You better give me
a better reason.

1230
02:12:49,300 --> 02:12:51,400
I'm as desolated
as you are, General.

1231
02:12:51,500 --> 02:12:53,500
Stand up. Up!

1232
02:12:54,900 --> 02:12:56,800
On your toes.

1233
02:13:00,300 --> 02:13:04,400
- You'll cut the skin.
- Why did the Cilicians run away?

1234
02:13:04,500 --> 02:13:06,600
They were paid.

1235
02:13:06,700 --> 02:13:08,800
And who paid them?

1236
02:13:08,900 --> 02:13:10,800
Who?

1237
02:13:10,900 --> 02:13:12,700
Crassus.

1238
02:13:18,500 --> 02:13:20,800
Crassus won't fight us himself.

1239
02:13:20,900 --> 02:13:24,200
The reports say he won't take
the command of an army.

1240
02:13:24,300 --> 02:13:27,600
Why would he bribe your pirates
to keep us from escaping?

1241
02:13:27,700 --> 02:13:30,400
I don't know. How can I answer
when there is no answer?

1242
02:13:30,500 --> 02:13:32,900
I've been betrayed,
just as you have!

1243
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:35,900
There is an answer.

1244
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:38,400
There must be an answer
to everything.

1245
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:42,500
We're five miles
from Brundusium.

1246
02:13:44,100 --> 02:13:46,800
Here's Rhegium.

1247
02:13:46,800 --> 02:13:49,800
Pompey's march must have
brought him to about here.

1248
02:13:49,800 --> 02:13:53,000
He's four days away,
maybe more.

1249
02:13:54,400 --> 02:13:57,600
Lucullus lands
at Brundusium tomorrow.

1250
02:13:57,700 --> 02:13:59,900
If we engage Lucullus...

1251
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:03,200
Pompey will have enough time
to march against our rear.

1252
02:14:04,500 --> 02:14:08,600
If we turn west
to meet Pompey...

1253
02:14:08,700 --> 02:14:11,400
Lucullus will march
against our rear.

1254
02:14:12,600 --> 02:14:17,100
The only other army
in all of Italy is here!

1255
02:14:17,200 --> 02:14:18,800
Rome.

1256
02:14:19,500 --> 02:14:21,700
Yes, of course!

1257
02:14:21,800 --> 02:14:24,300
Crassus is inviting us
to march on Rome...

1258
02:14:24,400 --> 02:14:26,600
so he can take the field
against us.

1259
02:14:26,600 --> 02:14:29,400
You mean Crassus wants us
to march on Rome?

1260
02:14:29,500 --> 02:14:32,100
He's forcing us to. He knows
I won't let myself be trapped...

1261
02:14:32,100 --> 02:14:35,200
between two armies
with my back to the sea.

1262
02:14:35,300 --> 02:14:37,900
He knows my only other choice
is Rome.

1263
02:14:39,500 --> 02:14:42,100
Somewhere on the way,
we meet.

1264
02:14:42,200 --> 02:14:45,400
If he beats us,
he becomes the saviour of Rome...

1265
02:14:45,500 --> 02:14:47,600
and there's his final victory
over the senate.

1266
02:14:47,700 --> 02:14:52,900
General, allow me
to redeem myself in your eyes.

1267
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:54,900
For a very small commission...

1268
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:59,500
I can arrange for you, your family
and your leaders, of course...

1269
02:14:59,500 --> 02:15:02,600
to be smuggled out of Italy and
transported to an eastern country...

1270
02:15:02,700 --> 02:15:05,500
where men of substance like you
are welcome and appreciated.

1271
02:15:05,500 --> 02:15:08,200
You can live there like kings
for the rest of your lives.

1272
02:15:08,300 --> 02:15:10,300
What do you think, General?

1273
02:15:11,100 --> 02:15:13,200
Go away.

1274
02:15:13,300 --> 02:15:15,700
Go away?

1275
02:15:28,900 --> 02:15:31,500
Tell the trumpeters
to sound assembly.

1276
02:15:39,600 --> 02:15:43,700
Tonight a Roman army lands
in the harbour of Brundusium.

1277
02:15:44,800 --> 02:15:47,800
Another army is approaching
us from the west.

1278
02:15:47,800 --> 02:15:50,800
Between them,
they hope to trap us here...

1279
02:15:50,900 --> 02:15:53,000
against the sea.

1280
02:15:53,100 --> 02:15:56,700
The Cilician pirates have betrayed us.
We have no ships.

1281
02:15:56,800 --> 02:15:59,700
"By order of the senate...

1282
02:15:59,800 --> 02:16:03,400
be it known that we have
this day elected...

1283
02:16:03,500 --> 02:16:06,200
Marcus Licinius Crassus...

1284
02:16:06,300 --> 02:16:09,200
first consul of the Republic...

1285
02:16:09,300 --> 02:16:13,800
and commander in chief
of the armies of Rome."

1286
02:16:13,900 --> 02:16:17,100
Hail Crassus!

1287
02:16:17,200 --> 02:16:21,200
Rome will not allow us
to escape from Italy.

1288
02:16:22,500 --> 02:16:26,000
We have no choice
but to march against Rome herself...

1289
02:16:26,100 --> 02:16:30,300
and end this war the only way
it could have ended:

1290
02:16:30,400 --> 02:16:34,100
by freeing every slave in Italy.

1291
02:16:34,200 --> 02:16:36,700
I promise you...

1292
02:16:36,800 --> 02:16:39,100
a new Rome...

1293
02:16:39,200 --> 02:16:41,300
a new Italy
and a new empire.

1294
02:16:42,400 --> 02:16:45,000
I promise the destruction
of the slave army...

1295
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,700
and the restoration of order...

1296
02:16:48,800 --> 02:16:50,900
throughout all our territories.

1297
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:55,200
I'd rather be here,
a free man among brothers...

1298
02:16:55,300 --> 02:16:58,700
facing a long march
and a hard fight...

1299
02:16:58,800 --> 02:17:02,200
than to be the richest citizen
of Rome...

1300
02:17:02,200 --> 02:17:05,200
fat with food
he didn't work for...

1301
02:17:05,300 --> 02:17:07,400
and surrounded by slaves.

1302
02:17:07,500 --> 02:17:11,000
I promise the living body
of Spartacus...

1303
02:17:11,100 --> 02:17:14,500
for whatever punishment
you may deem fit.

1304
02:17:14,500 --> 02:17:17,900
That or his head.

1305
02:17:18,800 --> 02:17:23,300
This I vow by the spirits
of all my forefathers.

1306
02:17:23,400 --> 02:17:26,100
This I have sworn...

1307
02:17:26,200 --> 02:17:28,800
in the temple
that guards their bones.

1308
02:17:30,500 --> 02:17:32,800
Hail Crassus!

1309
02:17:32,900 --> 02:17:36,300
We've travelled
a long ways together.

1310
02:17:36,400 --> 02:17:41,100
We've fought many battles
and won great victories.

1311
02:17:41,200 --> 02:17:45,700
Now, instead of taking ship
for our homes across the sea...

1312
02:17:45,800 --> 02:17:48,800
we must fight again.

1313
02:17:48,900 --> 02:17:51,700
Maybe there's no peace
in this world...

1314
02:17:51,800 --> 02:17:55,100
for us or for anyone else.
I don't know.

1315
02:17:56,200 --> 02:17:58,300
But I do know...

1316
02:17:58,400 --> 02:18:00,700
that as long as we live...

1317
02:18:00,800 --> 02:18:04,200
we must stay true to ourselves.

1318
02:18:05,600 --> 02:18:10,200
I do know that we're brothers,
and I know that we're free.

1319
02:18:17,200 --> 02:18:19,300
We march tonight!

1320
02:19:53,200 --> 02:19:55,900
Hail Crassus!

1321
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:58,100
Greetings to you, Crassus.

1322
02:19:58,200 --> 02:20:00,500
Caius. Gentlemen.

1323
02:20:01,700 --> 02:20:03,800
Have your dispositions
been made?

1324
02:20:03,900 --> 02:20:08,300
Each maniple knows its position in line,
sir, and exactly what's expected.

1325
02:20:08,400 --> 02:20:12,300
Every legion commander
has been given his battle orders.

1326
02:20:12,400 --> 02:20:15,100
Excellent. All positions
will now be changed.

1327
02:20:15,200 --> 02:20:17,100
Changed?

1328
02:20:17,200 --> 02:20:20,300
Spartacus takes too keen
an interest in our plans, I fear.

1329
02:20:21,700 --> 02:20:25,000
New battle orders
will be issued in a short while.

1330
02:20:27,700 --> 02:20:31,600
Spartacus has every reason to believe
that he has outdistanced...

1331
02:20:31,600 --> 02:20:35,400
the pursuing armies
of Pompey and of Lucullus.

1332
02:20:35,400 --> 02:20:38,600
However, there are passes
through the Apennine Mountains...

1333
02:20:38,700 --> 02:20:41,000
unknown to any map.

1334
02:20:42,500 --> 02:20:46,700
It may fortify
your courage to know...

1335
02:20:46,800 --> 02:20:51,000
that Pompey is at this moment encamped
some 20 miles to the west of us...

1336
02:20:51,100 --> 02:20:53,900
and that the army of Lucullus
approaches from the south...

1337
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:56,100
by forced night march.

1338
02:20:56,200 --> 02:21:00,300
Sir, allow us to pledge you the most
glorious victory of your career.

1339
02:21:02,400 --> 02:21:04,500
I'm not after glory!

1340
02:21:05,400 --> 02:21:07,500
I'm after Spartacus.

1341
02:21:08,600 --> 02:21:11,000
And, gentlemen,
I mean to have him.

1342
02:21:12,500 --> 02:21:16,800
However, this campaign
is not alone to kill Spartacus.

1343
02:21:16,900 --> 02:21:20,000
It is to kill
the legend of Spartacus.

1344
02:21:21,900 --> 02:21:23,900
You may go, gentlemen.

1345
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:25,900
Hail Crassus.

1346
02:21:28,700 --> 02:21:30,800
Lentulus Batiatus
awaits Your Excellency.

1347
02:21:30,900 --> 02:21:33,100
- Who?
- The lanista, sir.

1348
02:21:34,600 --> 02:21:36,700
Admit him.

1349
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:41,500
Most Blessed Highness,
as soon as I received your message...

1350
02:21:41,600 --> 02:21:43,600
I hurried into your
distinguished presence.

1351
02:21:43,700 --> 02:21:46,500
I'm glad you were able
to spare the time. Sit down.

1352
02:21:47,700 --> 02:21:49,600
How gracious.

1353
02:21:50,400 --> 02:21:53,500
I understand--
I'm informed--

1354
02:21:53,600 --> 02:21:56,000
that Spartacus once trained
under your auspices.

1355
02:21:56,100 --> 02:21:58,200
Yes! In fact...

1356
02:21:58,300 --> 02:22:00,900
if it isn't too subversive
to say so...

1357
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:04,200
I made him
what he is today.

1358
02:22:04,300 --> 02:22:06,700
You're to be congratulated
indeed.

1359
02:22:06,700 --> 02:22:10,800
I, too, as it happens, since you're
so admirably qualified to give me...

1360
02:22:10,900 --> 02:22:13,400
what up to now
I've not been able to obtain:

1361
02:22:13,400 --> 02:22:15,700
a physical description
of Spartacus.

1362
02:22:15,700 --> 02:22:16,800
Yes.

1363
02:22:17,400 --> 02:22:19,600
But you saw him.

1364
02:22:21,300 --> 02:22:23,400
- What?
- In the ring.

1365
02:22:24,800 --> 02:22:26,800
When?

1366
02:22:26,800 --> 02:22:30,500
When you visited my school
with those two charming ladies.

1367
02:22:32,100 --> 02:22:34,300
What ?

1368
02:22:34,400 --> 02:22:36,800
I trust they're both
in good health.

1369
02:22:36,800 --> 02:22:40,100
They selected him to fight
against Draba, the Negro.

1370
02:22:40,200 --> 02:22:43,200
- I remember the Negro.
- You had good cause to, if I remember--

1371
02:22:43,300 --> 02:22:45,500
If I may say so, Your Excellency.

1372
02:22:45,600 --> 02:22:48,000
A brilliant dagger thrust.
Difficult angle.

1373
02:22:48,100 --> 02:22:50,100
- Spartacus was the opponent?
- Yes.

1374
02:22:53,100 --> 02:22:55,500
What did he look like?

1375
02:22:55,600 --> 02:22:58,300
That's a matter of some
importance to Your Highness?

1376
02:22:58,400 --> 02:23:03,000
Yes, to every man who loves Rome
and wishes to see her strong.

1377
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:05,100
We're both Roman patriots, sir.

1378
02:23:05,200 --> 02:23:07,600
You're a great one.
I, of course, smaller.

1379
02:23:07,700 --> 02:23:10,300
But we both believe
in Roman fair play.

1380
02:23:10,300 --> 02:23:12,400
If you want
something from me...

1381
02:23:12,500 --> 02:23:15,500
I would be lacking
in respect for my own conscience...

1382
02:23:15,600 --> 02:23:17,700
if I did not say
that I wish something from you.

1383
02:23:17,800 --> 02:23:19,900
Name your price.

1384
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:22,200
If-- no--

1385
02:23:22,300 --> 02:23:24,900
when you win
your victory tomorrow...

1386
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:27,700
presumably the survivors
will be auctioned off...

1387
02:23:27,800 --> 02:23:31,100
in order to pay for the expenses
of this heroic expedition.

1388
02:23:32,500 --> 02:23:35,300
Could not the agent
for that sale be he...

1389
02:23:35,400 --> 02:23:39,600
who shares this tiny moment
of history with Your Honour?

1390
02:23:41,200 --> 02:23:45,200
I authorize you to be the agent
for the sale of all survivors.

1391
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:48,900
In return, you will remain here with us
until after the battle...

1392
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:51,100
and aid me
in identifying Spartacus.

1393
02:23:51,200 --> 02:23:53,100
After the battle?

1394
02:23:53,200 --> 02:23:55,900
You misunderstand me.
I'm a civilian.

1395
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:59,300
I'm even more of a civilian
than most civilians.

1396
02:24:00,100 --> 02:24:02,200
If you wish to remain so...

1397
02:24:02,300 --> 02:24:05,600
I should strongly advise you
to stay here and be our guest.

1398
02:24:05,600 --> 02:24:07,100
Guard!

1399
02:24:12,700 --> 02:24:17,500
My dear, all-conquering
Marcus Licinius Crassus...

1400
02:24:18,400 --> 02:24:20,700
what if it is Spartacus
who crosses the battlefield...

1401
02:24:20,800 --> 02:24:22,700
looking for you?

1402
02:24:24,900 --> 02:24:27,700
In such circumstances,
I have no doubt...

1403
02:24:27,800 --> 02:24:30,100
you will be helping him.

1404
02:24:30,200 --> 02:24:33,000
This fellow remains with us
until after the battle.

1405
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:37,200
Make him comfortable.
Don't let him feel lonely.

1406
02:26:10,200 --> 02:26:12,800
Mommy? Mommy?

1407
02:26:15,600 --> 02:26:18,200
When do we go home?

1408
02:26:22,700 --> 02:26:24,800
Go to sleep, dear.

1409
02:26:58,200 --> 02:27:00,500
No pains yet?

1410
02:27:00,600 --> 02:27:03,200
He's a bad child, though.
He hits me with his fist.

1411
02:27:03,300 --> 02:27:05,600
He wants to see his mother.
Can you blame him?

1412
02:27:06,600 --> 02:27:08,600
Can you feel it?

1413
02:27:09,900 --> 02:27:11,900
No, I don't.

1414
02:27:11,900 --> 02:27:14,400
I hope he waits
till we get to Rome.

1415
02:27:17,900 --> 02:27:19,700
Rome!

1416
02:27:21,400 --> 02:27:23,600
They've never beaten us yet.

1417
02:27:26,300 --> 02:27:28,600
No.

1418
02:27:30,200 --> 02:27:33,100
But no matter how many times
we beat them...

1419
02:27:33,200 --> 02:27:37,100
they still seem to have
another army to send against us.

1420
02:27:37,200 --> 02:27:39,100
And another.

1421
02:27:41,500 --> 02:27:45,300
Varinia, it just seems
like we've started something...

1422
02:27:46,200 --> 02:27:48,200
that has no ending!

1423
02:27:48,300 --> 02:27:51,800
If it ended tomorrow,
it would be worth it.

1424
02:27:59,100 --> 02:28:03,300
Varinia, don't make me weak.

1425
02:28:03,900 --> 02:28:06,900
You're strong enough
to be weak.

1426
02:28:11,700 --> 02:28:14,000
I love you more than my life.

1427
02:28:16,200 --> 02:28:20,200
Yet, sometimes, even with you here
sleeping beside me...

1428
02:28:22,100 --> 02:28:24,200
I feel so alone.

1429
02:28:25,800 --> 02:28:29,100
I imagine a god for slaves...

1430
02:28:29,200 --> 02:28:31,900
and I pray.

1431
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:34,100
What do you pray for?

1432
02:28:35,600 --> 02:28:38,700
I pray for a son
who'll be born free.

1433
02:28:40,400 --> 02:28:42,700
I pray for the same thing.

1434
02:28:47,700 --> 02:28:49,800
Take care of my son, Varinia.

1435
02:28:51,400 --> 02:28:53,500
If he never knows me...

1436
02:28:53,600 --> 02:28:57,200
tell him who I was
and what we dreamed of.

1437
02:28:57,300 --> 02:29:00,700
Tell him the truth. There will be
plenty of others to tell him lies.

1438
02:29:00,800 --> 02:29:02,900
I can't live without you,
Spartacus!

1439
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:18,900
For you and me
there can be no farewells.

1440
02:29:23,400 --> 02:29:26,200
As long as one of us lives...

1441
02:29:26,300 --> 02:29:28,400
we all live.

1442
02:29:29,300 --> 02:29:32,300
I felt it! Did you feel it?

1443
02:29:32,400 --> 02:29:35,300
- Yes, I did.
- That was so strong. Does it hurt you?

1444
02:29:36,400 --> 02:29:38,500
That was so strong.

1445
02:36:00,500 --> 02:36:03,000
Lucullus and Pompey.

1446
02:39:41,500 --> 02:39:43,500
Have we a count of prisoners?

1447
02:39:43,600 --> 02:39:46,300
We haven't made
the final count, sir.

1448
02:39:46,400 --> 02:39:49,400
I bring a message
from your master...

1449
02:39:49,500 --> 02:39:52,900
Marcus Licinius Crassus...

1450
02:39:53,000 --> 02:39:55,400
commander of Italy.

1451
02:39:55,500 --> 02:39:59,400
By command of
His Most Merciful Excellency...

1452
02:39:59,500 --> 02:40:02,000
your lives are to be spared.

1453
02:40:05,200 --> 02:40:07,100
Slaves you were...

1454
02:40:07,200 --> 02:40:09,300
and slaves you remain.

1455
02:40:09,400 --> 02:40:12,800
But the terrible penalty
of crucifixion...

1456
02:40:12,900 --> 02:40:15,000
has been set aside...

1457
02:40:15,100 --> 02:40:19,300
on the single condition
that you identify the body...

1458
02:40:19,400 --> 02:40:24,200
or the living person
of the slave called Spartacus.

1459
02:40:36,700 --> 02:40:39,400
- I'm Spartacus!
- I'm Spartacus!

1460
02:41:24,300 --> 02:41:27,500
Forgive me for being one of the last
to congratulate you, Your Nobility.

1461
02:41:27,500 --> 02:41:30,400
There's an ugly rumour
going round the camp...

1462
02:41:30,500 --> 02:41:33,200
that the prisoners
are to be crucified.

1463
02:41:33,900 --> 02:41:35,800
That is true.

1464
02:41:37,200 --> 02:41:39,300
Perhaps this is the moment
to remind Your Highness...

1465
02:41:39,400 --> 02:41:42,900
that yesterday you promised me I could
be the agent in their auctioning.

1466
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:46,800
Last night you promised
Spartacus to me! Where is he?

1467
02:41:46,800 --> 02:41:48,900
In return, I promised you
the sale of the survivors...

1468
02:41:49,000 --> 02:41:51,200
and there will be none!

1469
02:42:16,300 --> 02:42:18,800
- It's Varinia.
- Yes, I remember.

1470
02:42:18,800 --> 02:42:21,200
You're the woman of Spartacus?

1471
02:42:21,300 --> 02:42:23,400
I'm his wife.

1472
02:42:23,500 --> 02:42:25,600
And this is his child?

1473
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:28,200
Yes.

1474
02:42:28,800 --> 02:42:30,600
Where is Spartacus?

1475
02:42:34,800 --> 02:42:36,500
Dead.

1476
02:42:37,100 --> 02:42:39,200
Did you see him killed?

1477
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:45,300
Yes.

1478
02:42:47,100 --> 02:42:50,700
You're lying. Where is he?

1479
02:42:55,500 --> 02:42:57,800
At least here is someone
worth selling, Your Enormity.

1480
02:42:57,900 --> 02:43:00,700
I'll even take the child
as an investment.

1481
02:43:02,100 --> 02:43:04,600
- How many women have been taken?
- Under forty, sir.

1482
02:43:04,700 --> 02:43:07,800
Most of those who weren't killed have
run to the hills with their children.

1483
02:43:07,900 --> 02:43:10,200
You may sell all the others,
but not this woman.

1484
02:43:10,300 --> 02:43:12,300
But you haven't seen
the others, Your Magnitude.

1485
02:43:12,400 --> 02:43:15,300
They're of surpassing ugliness!
A genius wouldn't be able to sell them!

1486
02:43:15,400 --> 02:43:18,300
Flog that scoundrel out of camp.

1487
02:43:18,400 --> 02:43:21,900
This woman and her child
are to be conveyed to my house in Rome.

1488
02:43:36,100 --> 02:43:38,200
- Halt them!
- Halt!

1489
02:43:42,900 --> 02:43:44,200
Antoninus?

1490
02:44:01,800 --> 02:44:02,900
Tribune!

1491
02:44:09,400 --> 02:44:12,800
Slaves are to be crucified
along the roadside...

1492
02:44:12,900 --> 02:44:17,000
the whole distance between here
and the gates of Rome.

1493
02:44:20,200 --> 02:44:22,200
Hold this man till the end.

1494
02:44:25,600 --> 02:44:27,500
And that man too.

1495
02:44:35,100 --> 02:44:37,200
- March on.
- March on!

1496
02:45:31,100 --> 02:45:33,800
I've more stripes on my back
than a zebra!

1497
02:45:33,900 --> 02:45:36,700
Every time I touch my wounds...

1498
02:45:37,400 --> 02:45:40,300
they sing like larks.

1499
02:45:40,400 --> 02:45:42,500
But in spite of that,
I think I've found something...

1500
02:45:42,600 --> 02:45:45,300
- I never had before with all my wealth.
- What is that?

1501
02:45:46,500 --> 02:45:49,400
Don't laugh at me,
but I believe it to be dignity.

1502
02:45:49,500 --> 02:45:52,100
In Rome,
dignity shortens life...

1503
02:45:52,200 --> 02:45:54,700
even more surely than disease.

1504
02:45:54,700 --> 02:45:57,200
The gods must be saving you
for some great enterprise.

1505
02:45:57,800 --> 02:45:59,900
You think so?

1506
02:46:00,000 --> 02:46:04,400
Anyone who believes I'll turn informer
for nothing is a fool.

1507
02:46:04,500 --> 02:46:07,000
I bore the whip
without complaint.

1508
02:46:07,100 --> 02:46:11,100
Yes, indeed, that sounds
like a bad attack of dignity.

1509
02:46:11,100 --> 02:46:13,500
I hope, however,
this will not deflect you...

1510
02:46:13,600 --> 02:46:15,900
from the revenge
you were going to take on Crassus.

1511
02:46:16,000 --> 02:46:18,700
No, on the contrary.
It only strengthens my resolve.

1512
02:46:18,800 --> 02:46:21,600
I'm glad to learn that.

1513
02:46:23,800 --> 02:46:27,400
This woman Varinia is in his house.
All Rome knows about it.

1514
02:46:27,400 --> 02:46:29,500
Malicious tongues even say...

1515
02:46:29,600 --> 02:46:32,800
that he's in love
for the first time in his life.

1516
02:46:36,700 --> 02:46:39,500
I noticed a strange look in his eye
when he first saw her.

1517
02:46:39,500 --> 02:46:41,900
It would take a great woman...

1518
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:45,100
to make Crassus
fall out of love with himself.

1519
02:46:45,200 --> 02:46:47,300
I'll be honest with you,
Gracchus.

1520
02:46:47,300 --> 02:46:50,500
She's not as unattractive
as I told you she was.

1521
02:46:50,600 --> 02:46:54,600
Dignity and honesty in one afternoon!
I hardly recognize you.

1522
02:46:55,300 --> 02:46:58,100
- But she is an impossible woman.
- Beautiful?

1523
02:46:58,100 --> 02:47:00,500
Beautiful? Well, beautiful.

1524
02:47:00,600 --> 02:47:03,200
The more chains you put on her,
the less like a slave she looks.

1525
02:47:03,300 --> 02:47:05,400
- Proud?
- Proud, proud.

1526
02:47:05,500 --> 02:47:08,200
You'd feel that she would surrender
to the right man...

1527
02:47:08,300 --> 02:47:10,600
which is irritating.

1528
02:47:11,400 --> 02:47:15,500
I like Crassus.
Let's save him from his agony.

1529
02:47:15,600 --> 02:47:17,700
Let's steal this woman.

1530
02:47:18,800 --> 02:47:21,200
Steal the woman? Why?

1531
02:47:21,300 --> 02:47:23,600
I can no longer hurt Crassus
in the senate...

1532
02:47:23,700 --> 02:47:27,400
but I can hurt him where
he'll feel it most: in his pride.

1533
02:47:27,500 --> 02:47:29,700
Attack our enemy from within.

1534
02:47:29,800 --> 02:47:31,700
The scheme is excellent...

1535
02:47:31,800 --> 02:47:34,800
but I hope you're not suggesting
that I steal the woman!

1536
02:47:34,900 --> 02:47:37,100
Yes.

1537
02:47:37,200 --> 02:47:40,300
Buy some horses
and a cart with a canopy.

1538
02:47:40,400 --> 02:47:42,500
Bring her here by nightfall.

1539
02:47:44,400 --> 02:47:48,200
Add courage
to your newfound virtues.

1540
02:47:50,200 --> 02:47:53,600
Would half a million sesterces
make you brave?

1541
02:47:56,400 --> 02:47:58,500
Half a million?

1542
02:48:02,400 --> 02:48:07,400
Crassus does seem to dwindle
in the mind, but--

1543
02:48:07,500 --> 02:48:10,400
Let's reduce him still further.
A round million!

1544
02:48:11,600 --> 02:48:13,700
A million.

1545
02:48:13,800 --> 02:48:16,000
For such a sum,
I could bribe Jupiter himself!

1546
02:48:17,100 --> 02:48:19,200
With a lesser sum, I have.

1547
02:48:25,600 --> 02:48:27,400
Forgive the intrusion.

1548
02:48:27,500 --> 02:48:30,100
You know I'm not in the habit
of coming into your house uninvited.

1549
02:48:30,200 --> 02:48:32,300
You've always been welcome here...

1550
02:48:32,400 --> 02:48:34,500
as a pupil.

1551
02:48:38,400 --> 02:48:41,100
- You're not alone.
- No.

1552
02:48:42,900 --> 02:48:45,800
This time you've come to teach.

1553
02:48:47,400 --> 02:48:49,500
You've joined Crassus?

1554
02:48:50,500 --> 02:48:52,800
- Am I arrested?
- No.

1555
02:48:52,900 --> 02:48:55,700
But I must ask you to come with me
to the senate immediately.

1556
02:48:58,000 --> 02:49:00,400
What I do,
I do not for myself...

1557
02:49:01,300 --> 02:49:03,600
but for Rome.

1558
02:49:03,700 --> 02:49:06,400
Poor helpless Rome!

1559
02:49:06,500 --> 02:49:10,800
Let's go and hear more
about Rome from Crassus!

1560
02:49:15,800 --> 02:49:18,100
Did you truly believe
500 years of Rome...

1561
02:49:18,200 --> 02:49:22,000
could so easily be delivered
into the clutches of a mob?

1562
02:49:25,400 --> 02:49:29,400
Already the bodies
of 6,000 crucified slaves...

1563
02:49:29,500 --> 02:49:31,900
Line the Appian Way.

1564
02:49:31,900 --> 02:49:34,900
Tomorrow the last of their companions
will fight to the death...

1565
02:49:35,000 --> 02:49:39,000
in the temple of my fathers
as a sacrifice to them.

1566
02:49:39,100 --> 02:49:42,800
As those slaves have died,
so will your rabble...

1567
02:49:42,900 --> 02:49:48,000
if they falter one instant
in loyalty to the new order of affairs.

1568
02:49:48,100 --> 02:49:51,200
The enemies of the state
are known.

1569
02:49:51,300 --> 02:49:55,300
Arrests are in progress.
The prisons begin to fill.

1570
02:49:55,400 --> 02:49:59,900
In every city and province, lists
of the disloyal have been compiled.

1571
02:50:00,000 --> 02:50:04,700
Tomorrow they will learn
the cost of their terrible folly...

1572
02:50:05,500 --> 02:50:07,200
their treason.

1573
02:50:08,700 --> 02:50:10,700
Where does my name appear...

1574
02:50:10,700 --> 02:50:14,000
on the list of disloyal enemies
of the state?

1575
02:50:14,100 --> 02:50:15,900
First.

1576
02:50:17,900 --> 02:50:21,500
Yet upon you I have
no desire for vengeance.

1577
02:50:22,300 --> 02:50:24,800
Your property
shall not be touched.

1578
02:50:24,900 --> 02:50:28,500
You will retain the rank
and title of Roman senator.

1579
02:50:28,500 --> 02:50:30,600
A house...

1580
02:50:30,700 --> 02:50:35,000
a farmhouse in Picenum
has been provided for your exile.

1581
02:50:35,100 --> 02:50:37,100
You may take your women
with you.

1582
02:50:39,200 --> 02:50:43,200
Why am I to be left
so conspicuously alive?

1583
02:50:43,300 --> 02:50:47,000
Your followers are
deluded enough to trust you.

1584
02:50:47,100 --> 02:50:50,100
I intend that you shall speak to them
tomorrow for their own good...

1585
02:50:50,200 --> 02:50:53,600
their peaceful
and profitable future.

1586
02:50:53,700 --> 02:50:56,400
From time to time thereafter,
I may find it useful...

1587
02:50:56,500 --> 02:50:59,700
to bring you back to Rome
to continue your duty to her...

1588
02:50:59,700 --> 02:51:02,600
to calm the envious spirit...

1589
02:51:02,700 --> 02:51:04,900
and the troubled mind.

1590
02:51:05,000 --> 02:51:10,300
You will persuade them
to accept destiny and order...

1591
02:51:10,400 --> 02:51:12,600
and trust the gods!

1592
02:51:16,900 --> 02:51:18,800
You may go.

1593
02:51:29,600 --> 02:51:31,500
Halt!

1594
02:52:17,400 --> 02:52:20,600
Now, why hide
behind that stola ?

1595
02:52:25,600 --> 02:52:27,700
That's better.

1596
02:52:27,700 --> 02:52:31,100
That dress took some weeks
of a woman's life.

1597
02:52:31,200 --> 02:52:35,700
You, above all people, should respect
the work of slaves and wear it proudly.

1598
02:52:35,800 --> 02:52:37,700
Come here.

1599
02:52:51,900 --> 02:52:54,000
This belonged to a queen...

1600
02:52:55,500 --> 02:52:57,600
the queen of Persia.

1601
02:52:58,200 --> 02:53:00,300
It's heavy.

1602
02:53:01,800 --> 02:53:04,100
In time you will wear it
lightly enough.

1603
02:53:17,600 --> 02:53:19,500
Sit down.

1604
02:53:22,600 --> 02:53:25,800
Will you have
some squab and honey?

1605
02:53:27,300 --> 02:53:28,800
No.

1606
02:53:28,800 --> 02:53:30,900
You'll enjoy it.

1607
02:53:32,200 --> 02:53:34,300
And a piece of melon?

1608
02:53:38,500 --> 02:53:40,600
And some wine, of course.

1609
02:53:42,500 --> 02:53:44,200
Eat.

1610
02:53:49,800 --> 02:53:51,800
I did not command you to eat.

1611
02:53:51,900 --> 02:53:54,000
I invited you.

1612
02:53:55,500 --> 02:53:57,900
You find the richness
of your surroundings...

1613
02:53:58,000 --> 02:54:00,100
makes conversation difficult?

1614
02:54:02,900 --> 02:54:05,000
Why am I here?

1615
02:54:08,300 --> 02:54:10,700
Good question.

1616
02:54:10,800 --> 02:54:13,500
A woman's question.

1617
02:54:13,600 --> 02:54:17,300
I wish the answer could be
as good and straightforward.

1618
02:54:21,300 --> 02:54:24,900
- The infant-- it thrives?
- He thrives.

1619
02:54:24,900 --> 02:54:27,200
I purchased a wet nurse
for him yesterday.

1620
02:54:27,300 --> 02:54:29,500
I hope milk agrees with him.

1621
02:54:32,500 --> 02:54:34,900
I sent her away.

1622
02:54:35,000 --> 02:54:37,700
I prefer to nurse
the child myself.

1623
02:54:38,900 --> 02:54:41,000
I'm not sure I approve.

1624
02:54:42,200 --> 02:54:45,200
It ties you to the old life.

1625
02:54:45,200 --> 02:54:48,800
I want you to begin
to look forward to the new.

1626
02:54:51,100 --> 02:54:54,000
I don't care
about my new life here.

1627
02:54:54,000 --> 02:54:56,900
You care about the life
of your child, don't you?

1628
02:54:58,600 --> 02:55:01,700
Why do you threaten me
with my baby?

1629
02:55:01,800 --> 02:55:04,400
I belong to you.
You can take me anytime you wish.

1630
02:55:05,000 --> 02:55:07,700
But I don't want to take you.

1631
02:55:08,600 --> 02:55:10,900
I want you to give.

1632
02:55:12,500 --> 02:55:14,600
I want your love, Varinia.

1633
02:55:18,800 --> 02:55:21,200
You think by threatening
to kill my child...

1634
02:55:21,300 --> 02:55:23,400
you'll make me love you?

1635
02:55:23,400 --> 02:55:26,800
I did not threaten
to kill your child.

1636
02:55:33,800 --> 02:55:36,900
I'm sorry, Varinia.

1637
02:55:43,200 --> 02:55:45,500
One shouldn't grieve forever.

1638
02:55:46,500 --> 02:55:48,600
I'm not grieving.

1639
02:55:48,700 --> 02:55:50,800
I'm remembering.

1640
02:55:50,800 --> 02:55:53,100
Do I interfere
with your memories?

1641
02:55:54,300 --> 02:55:56,400
No.

1642
02:55:58,500 --> 02:56:00,600
You tread the ridge
between truth and insult...

1643
02:56:00,700 --> 02:56:02,800
with the skill
of a mountain goat!

1644
02:56:07,200 --> 02:56:10,200
What do you remember
when you think about Spartacus?

1645
02:56:13,000 --> 02:56:15,200
It doesn't distress you
to talk about him?

1646
02:56:15,300 --> 02:56:16,300
No.

1647
02:56:18,400 --> 02:56:20,300
Well, then...

1648
02:56:22,000 --> 02:56:24,700
what sort of a man was he...

1649
02:56:25,400 --> 02:56:27,000
really?

1650
02:56:31,300 --> 02:56:34,300
He was a man
who began all alone...

1651
02:56:34,300 --> 02:56:36,800
Like an animal.

1652
02:56:36,800 --> 02:56:38,900
Yet on the day he died...

1653
02:56:39,000 --> 02:56:42,500
thousands and thousands
would gladly have died in his place.

1654
02:56:44,200 --> 02:56:46,800
What was he?
Was he a god?

1655
02:56:48,400 --> 02:56:50,500
He wasn't a god.

1656
02:56:51,200 --> 02:56:53,400
He was a simple man.

1657
02:56:53,400 --> 02:56:55,400
A slave.

1658
02:56:58,000 --> 02:56:59,800
I loved him.

1659
02:57:00,900 --> 02:57:03,300
He was an outlaw!
A murderer!

1660
02:57:03,400 --> 02:57:07,200
An enemy to everything fine
and decent that Rome ever built!

1661
02:57:08,700 --> 02:57:10,800
Damn you! You tell me.

1662
02:57:10,900 --> 02:57:13,200
- Why did you love him?
- I can't tell you.

1663
02:57:14,400 --> 02:57:16,800
I can't tell you things
you can never understand.

1664
02:57:18,800 --> 02:57:21,600
But I want to understand.

1665
02:57:22,400 --> 02:57:26,600
Don't you see?
I must understand.

1666
02:57:35,100 --> 02:57:37,500
You're afraid of him,
aren't you?

1667
02:57:41,700 --> 02:57:44,000
That's why you want his wife...

1668
02:57:44,100 --> 02:57:48,000
to soothe your fear
by having something he had.

1669
02:57:50,100 --> 02:57:53,900
When you're so afraid,
nothing can help.

1670
02:57:54,000 --> 02:57:55,900
Nothing.

1671
02:58:03,800 --> 02:58:05,400
We shall see.

1672
02:58:30,700 --> 02:58:33,000
Could we have won,
Spartacus?

1673
02:58:35,200 --> 02:58:37,300
Could we ever have won?

1674
02:58:41,800 --> 02:58:44,500
Just by fighting them,
we won something.

1675
02:58:47,900 --> 02:58:51,300
When just one man says,
"No, I won't"...

1676
02:58:51,400 --> 02:58:53,500
Rome begins to fear.

1677
02:58:58,500 --> 02:59:01,100
And we were tens of thousands
who said no.

1678
02:59:02,400 --> 02:59:05,200
That was the wonder of it.

1679
02:59:05,200 --> 02:59:08,800
To have seen slaves
lift their heads from the dust...

1680
02:59:11,000 --> 02:59:13,800
to see them rise
from their knees...

1681
02:59:14,500 --> 02:59:16,600
stand tall...

1682
02:59:18,700 --> 02:59:20,800
with a song on their lips...

1683
02:59:22,500 --> 02:59:24,400
to hear them...

1684
02:59:25,400 --> 02:59:29,000
storm through the mountains
shouting...

1685
02:59:31,300 --> 02:59:34,100
to hear them sing
along the plains.

1686
02:59:37,700 --> 02:59:40,000
And now they're dead.

1687
02:59:42,500 --> 02:59:44,200
Dead.

1688
02:59:50,500 --> 02:59:52,200
Varinia...

1689
02:59:55,600 --> 02:59:57,200
dead.

1690
03:00:01,200 --> 03:00:03,300
And the baby.

1691
03:00:16,000 --> 03:00:17,700
All of them.

1692
03:00:28,700 --> 03:00:31,200
Are you afraid to die,
Spartacus?

1693
03:00:34,200 --> 03:00:36,500
No more than I was
to be born.

1694
03:00:48,000 --> 03:00:50,100
Are you afraid?

1695
03:00:52,900 --> 03:00:55,000
Yes.

1696
03:01:07,100 --> 03:01:09,100
Hail Counsel!

1697
03:01:09,100 --> 03:01:11,700
Guards, fall in.

1698
03:01:11,800 --> 03:01:14,800
- Where are the gladiators?
- Over there, sir.

1699
03:01:39,200 --> 03:01:43,500
Antoninus, the night passes slowly,
doesn't it?

1700
03:02:01,800 --> 03:02:03,700
You are he...

1701
03:02:04,600 --> 03:02:06,300
aren't you?

1702
03:02:09,300 --> 03:02:13,600
Gladiator,
I'm Marcus Licinius Crassus.

1703
03:02:16,800 --> 03:02:21,500
You must answer
when I speak to you.

1704
03:02:44,200 --> 03:02:45,900
Centurion!

1705
03:02:48,800 --> 03:02:52,500
Let them fight now.
Unchain them.

1706
03:02:52,600 --> 03:02:55,000
The entire city's been told
they'll fight tomorrow...

1707
03:02:55,000 --> 03:02:57,000
in the temple of your ancestors.

1708
03:02:57,100 --> 03:03:00,400
They will fight now, for me.
Here!

1709
03:03:00,500 --> 03:03:02,300
And to the death.

1710
03:03:02,400 --> 03:03:04,400
And the victor shall be crucified.

1711
03:03:04,500 --> 03:03:08,800
We will test this myth
of slave brotherhood.

1712
03:03:08,900 --> 03:03:10,300
Unchain them!

1713
03:03:17,900 --> 03:03:19,900
Form a circle.

1714
03:03:36,200 --> 03:03:38,200
Don't give them
the pleasure of a contest.

1715
03:03:38,300 --> 03:03:40,400
Lower your guard.
I'll kill you on the first rush.

1716
03:03:40,500 --> 03:03:43,700
- I won't let them crucify you!
- It's my last order. Obey it!

1717
03:03:43,800 --> 03:03:45,600
Let them begin.

1718
03:04:22,300 --> 03:04:24,500
I won't let them crucify you.

1719
03:04:35,300 --> 03:04:37,800
Do you realize how long it takes
to die on the cross?

1720
03:04:37,800 --> 03:04:39,600
I don't care!

1721
03:04:56,400 --> 03:04:58,600
Forgive me, Antoninus.

1722
03:05:08,800 --> 03:05:13,000
I love you, Spartacus,
as I loved my own father.

1723
03:05:13,700 --> 03:05:15,900
I love you...

1724
03:05:16,000 --> 03:05:18,500
Like my son
that I'll never see.

1725
03:05:22,900 --> 03:05:25,000
Go to sleep.

1726
03:05:58,800 --> 03:06:00,900
Here's your victory.

1727
03:06:02,900 --> 03:06:05,000
He'll come back.

1728
03:06:05,100 --> 03:06:07,700
He'll come back
and he'll be millions!

1729
03:06:12,600 --> 03:06:15,700
I wonder what Spartacus
would say...

1730
03:06:15,800 --> 03:06:19,400
if he knew that the woman,
Varinia, and her child...

1731
03:06:20,300 --> 03:06:22,700
are slaves in my household?

1732
03:06:35,500 --> 03:06:37,300
Yes.

1733
03:06:45,200 --> 03:06:47,100
Crucify him!

1734
03:07:06,100 --> 03:07:08,700
I want no grave for him.
No marker.

1735
03:07:08,800 --> 03:07:12,300
His body's to be burnt
and his ashes scattered in secret.

1736
03:07:22,200 --> 03:07:24,500
Did you fear him, Crassus?

1737
03:07:24,600 --> 03:07:26,700
Not when I fought him.

1738
03:07:26,800 --> 03:07:28,800
I knew he could be beaten.

1739
03:07:28,900 --> 03:07:32,800
But now I fear him,
even more than I fear you.

1740
03:07:32,800 --> 03:07:35,800
- Me?
- Yes, my dear Caesar.

1741
03:07:35,900 --> 03:07:37,600
You!

1742
03:07:38,800 --> 03:07:41,900
I don't see the letter here
to the leader of the senate.

1743
03:07:43,400 --> 03:07:46,200
Julia, I don't like
the sound of weeping.

1744
03:07:46,300 --> 03:07:48,900
This is a happy house.
Please stop it.

1745
03:07:50,100 --> 03:07:53,200
There you are. Go away, Julia!
Where have you been all this time?

1746
03:07:53,300 --> 03:07:55,700
The city is full of Crassus' legions.
We've been hiding.

1747
03:07:55,800 --> 03:07:58,400
I don't know Rome
as well as I know Capua.

1748
03:07:58,400 --> 03:08:00,700
They're arresting everyone!

1749
03:08:10,100 --> 03:08:12,100
So this is the woman...

1750
03:08:12,200 --> 03:08:14,500
it took Crassus'
eight Roman legions to conquer!

1751
03:08:14,500 --> 03:08:17,900
I wish I had time to make
your acquaintance, my dear.

1752
03:08:18,000 --> 03:08:21,600
Unfortunately, we all have
to make journeys...

1753
03:08:21,600 --> 03:08:23,700
to different destinations.

1754
03:08:23,800 --> 03:08:27,400
- Where are we going?
- You're going to Aquitania.

1755
03:08:27,500 --> 03:08:30,100
The governor's one
of my innumerable cousins.

1756
03:08:30,200 --> 03:08:32,500
Here's a senatorial pass.
It's valid in all the known world.

1757
03:08:32,600 --> 03:08:34,700
Why do I have to go
to Aquitania?

1758
03:08:34,700 --> 03:08:36,800
'Cause I ask you to.

1759
03:08:36,900 --> 03:08:39,300
It's very good of you, Gracchus,
but I'd rather--

1760
03:08:39,400 --> 03:08:43,300
Double the money I promised you.
Here's two million sesterces.

1761
03:08:43,400 --> 03:08:45,800
Two million?

1762
03:08:45,900 --> 03:08:48,900
Here. Articles of Freedom
for the woman.

1763
03:08:50,000 --> 03:08:52,300
And here's a smaller document
that I've prepared...

1764
03:08:52,400 --> 03:08:55,800
for the child
befitting its size.

1765
03:09:01,100 --> 03:09:03,000
Where are you going?

1766
03:09:05,400 --> 03:09:07,300
To Picenum.

1767
03:09:07,400 --> 03:09:10,400
Picenum?
That's the dreariest town in Italy.

1768
03:09:10,500 --> 03:09:12,400
Will you please leave me?

1769
03:09:13,900 --> 03:09:15,800
Come with us.

1770
03:09:15,900 --> 03:09:18,100
See to it that I don't misuse
the money.

1771
03:09:18,200 --> 03:09:20,300
Don't be ridiculous.
I'm a senator.

1772
03:09:20,400 --> 03:09:24,000
Will you please go
before the soldiers come here?

1773
03:09:31,400 --> 03:09:35,000
This would really make
Crassus jealous.

1774
03:09:36,300 --> 03:09:38,400
Go and make
my joy complete.

1775
03:09:38,500 --> 03:09:41,600
Save your tears now.
Save them for the journey.

1776
03:09:52,300 --> 03:09:54,300
Prettier.

1777
03:10:13,200 --> 03:10:14,800
Halt!

1778
03:10:19,700 --> 03:10:21,700
Identify yourselves, please.

1779
03:10:23,300 --> 03:10:26,600
- Lentulus Batiatus.
- Climb down and identify yourselves.

1780
03:10:26,700 --> 03:10:29,500
- I object to that tone.
- I've got my orders.

1781
03:10:29,600 --> 03:10:32,100
Come down
and identify yourselves, please.

1782
03:10:40,100 --> 03:10:43,600
As I told you, I'm Lentulus Batiatus,
the lanista from Capua.

1783
03:10:43,700 --> 03:10:47,800
This--
my sister-in-law.

1784
03:10:51,000 --> 03:10:52,900
Lady, please.

1785
03:10:53,900 --> 03:10:56,600
She's travelling...

1786
03:10:56,700 --> 03:11:00,700
with her child to Aquitania
on a senatorial pass.

1787
03:11:00,800 --> 03:11:04,200
- Take a look through his baggage.
- Not a word, please.

1788
03:11:10,200 --> 03:11:12,100
What did you say?

1789
03:11:55,100 --> 03:11:58,300
- Tell the lady no loitering's allowed.
- Instantly.

1790
03:11:58,400 --> 03:12:00,700
Move on!

1791
03:12:04,600 --> 03:12:06,700
This is your son.

1792
03:12:08,300 --> 03:12:10,400
He's free, Spartacus!

1793
03:12:11,100 --> 03:12:13,000
Free!

1794
03:12:15,100 --> 03:12:17,100
He's free.

1795
03:12:22,400 --> 03:12:24,500
He'll remember you, Spartacus.

1796
03:12:25,500 --> 03:12:27,600
Because I'll tell him.

1797
03:12:28,600 --> 03:12:32,000
I'll tell him who his father was
and what he dreamed of!

1798
03:12:35,300 --> 03:12:38,800
Varinia, have mercy on us.
Get in the wagon.

1799
03:12:39,900 --> 03:12:42,000
My love, my life.

1800
03:12:44,600 --> 03:12:47,300
Please die. Die.

1801
03:12:47,400 --> 03:12:50,800
Please, please die, my love.

1802
03:12:50,800 --> 03:12:53,100
Oh, God!
Why can't you die?

1803
03:12:53,100 --> 03:12:55,100
Come on.

1804
03:13:11,200 --> 03:13:14,200
Good-bye, my love, my life.

1805
03:13:14,300 --> 03:13:15,900
Good-bye, good-bye.

1806
03:13:53,500 --> 03:14:14,300
