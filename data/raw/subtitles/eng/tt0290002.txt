Well, during
the breastfeeding stage, Greg,

430
00:15:40,906 --> 00:15:42,771

very confused and upset

from their mothers.

432
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,335
So l invented something

you'll want to start
a family of your own.

Yeah. Right.
Actually, on the subject,

530
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:32,734
l had some thoughts
about the wedding date.

531
00:19:32,804 --> 00:19:35,295
We'll discuss that later,
after this weekend, Greg.

532
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:36,636
Now, let's get back on point.

533
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:38,437
Let me put it very simply.

534
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,909
lf your family circle

535
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:42,208
does indeed join
my family circle,

536
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:43,942
they'll form a chain.

537
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:46,641
l can't have a chink
in my chain.

538
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:47,707
Hmm.

539
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:50,219
Yeah. Okay.
l get the metaphor.

540
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:51,950
Now,
l've never met your parents,

541
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,686
so l'm not going to jump
to any hasty conclusions.

542
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,853
But, like studying
a frozen caveman,

543
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:58,624
if l can see
where you came from,

544
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:01,188
l'll have a much better idea
of where you're going.

545
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:02,392
Okay.

546
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:05,834
A-are you thinking
maybe my parents might be

547
00:20:05,904 --> 00:20:07,929
like--like a chink
in the chain or...

548
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,973
A doctor and a lawyer,
what's there to worry about?

549
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:12,836
Mmm-hmm.

550
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:28,482

555
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:52,248
That is my father.

00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:03,461
(Bernie)
Hey! There you are.

558
00:21:03,528 --> 00:21:04,927
What the heck is
that contraption?

559
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:06,828
l thought you guys
were flying in tonight.

560
00:21:06,898 --> 00:21:08,798
l left a message yesterday
We were driving--

561
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:10,266
Oh, l didn't get a message.

562
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:11,859
(Greg)
l left you like five messages.

563
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,837
Will you get over here
and plant one on me.

564
00:21:13,905 --> 00:21:14,963
Talking about messages.

565
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:18,532
l've been waiting so long
to see you. My best buddy.

566
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:19,838
Good to see you.

567
00:21:19,911 --> 00:21:22,141
Come here. Come here.
Oh, l missed you.

568
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:24,739
ls this not
the most handsome young man

569
00:21:24,816 --> 00:21:26,249
you've ever seen
in your life?

570
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:29,219
l used to call him
a young Jewish Marlon Brando.

571
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:30,377
Huh?

572
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:31,578
[all laughing]

573
00:21:31,823 --> 00:21:33,085
Can you believe

574
00:21:33,158 --> 00:21:35,217
l conceived him
with one testicle?

575
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,989
(Bernie)
No, really. lt's true.

576
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:39,360
l only have one because
the other never dropped.

577
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:41,262
lt's called
an undescending testicle.

578
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,767
lt's not uncommon,
but look at him.

579
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:47,097

looked like if l had two.

Whoa!
Ho!

Wow! You're harder

You work out
with weights, right?

606

Well, l do
various calisthenics.

Oh, Capoeira. Yeah.

00:23:04,816 --> 00:23:06,579

share this one for now.

Since there's a water scarcity
on the island,

''if it's yellow let it mellow,

703
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,414
They're great.

704
00:25:59,491 --> 00:26:00,924
Because, you know,
after two years,

705
00:26:00,992 --> 00:26:02,721
you have to work
to keep things going.

706
00:26:02,794 --> 00:26:04,557
Does she still
climax regularly?

707
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:05,753
Mom.

708
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,764
You can't talk that way
this weekend, okay?

709
00:26:07,832 --> 00:26:08,958
Honey, l'm just saying

710
00:26:09,034 --> 00:26:10,661
l didn't raise you
to be a so-so lover.

711
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:12,600
l know.
Okay, what is he doing?

712
00:26:12,671 --> 00:26:15,071
What?
Don't--don't worry about them.

713
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:16,366
Mom, Mom,

714
00:26:16,441 --> 00:26:18,341
you got to get these people
out of here now.

715
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:19,399
Okay.

716
00:26:19,477 --> 00:26:20,705
Wipe that
little gloss off you.

717
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:21,803
Okay.

718
00:26:23,481 --> 00:26:24,948
You hunt deer, Bernard?

719
00:26:25,016 --> 00:26:26,608
What? No, l hate that thing.

720
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:28,118
Roz's father gave it to us.

721
00:26:28,186 --> 00:26:31,383
He was into all that
macho-wacho crap.

722
00:26:31,456 --> 00:26:32,514
Oh! So is Greg.

723
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:35,116
He and l went
duck-hunting together.
Didn't we, Greg? Hmm?

724
00:26:35,193 --> 00:26:36,524
Duck-hunting?
Me and you?

725
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:37,755
Duck-hunting?
Yeah. Mmm-hmm.

726
00:26:37,829 --> 00:26:38,853
What? What?

727
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:41,524
Gay, you went duck-hunting
with--with Jack?

728
00:26:42,067 --> 00:26:43,591
Um, yeah. We went, we did.

729
00:26:43,668 --> 00:26:45,260
We went
on a little hunting trip.

730
00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:46,463
You shot a duck?

731
00:26:46,538 --> 00:26:49,268
l shot at a duck and...
Mmm-hmm.

732
00:26:49,341 --> 00:26:51,969
You killed an
innocent creature of the sky?

733
00:26:52,043 --> 00:26:53,635
l don't... Did l...
l did... l don't...

734
00:26:53,712 --> 00:26:55,680
l think
l might've clipped it or...

735
00:26:55,747 --> 00:26:57,612
Never really checked.

736
00:27:25,243 --> 00:27:26,870
Oh, Lord.

737
00:27:26,945 --> 00:27:30,506
And now,
for the piece de resistance.

738
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:34,380
[gasping]
Oh, my goodness.

739
00:27:34,452 --> 00:27:36,113
Little somethin'
l've been workin' on.

740
00:27:36,187 --> 00:27:38,178
Oh, l see. Oh.

741
00:27:39,624 --> 00:27:42,149
Mom will be out in a sec.
What's that?

742
00:27:42,227 --> 00:27:43,524
lt's you.

743
00:27:43,595 --> 00:27:44,960
lt's the Wall of Gaylord.

744
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:47,131
The Wall of Gaylord?

745
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:50,597
lsn't it nice to finally
display your accomplishments,
Son?

746
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:52,068
Honey, look
at all your awards.

747
00:27:52,137 --> 00:27:53,297
That's great.

748
00:27:53,371 --> 00:27:54,395
He's my champion.

749
00:27:54,472 --> 00:27:55,461
Oh, l didn't know

750
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,201
they made ninth place
ribbons.

751
00:27:57,275 --> 00:27:59,835
Oh, Jack, they got them
all the way up to 10th place.

752
00:27:59,911 --> 00:28:02,038
Hey! Anybody want to
get a drink by the lagoon?

753
00:28:02,113 --> 00:28:03,580
This one looks impressive.

754
00:28:03,648 --> 00:28:07,812
''Mazel tov, Gaylord M. Focker.
World's Greatest Nurse.''

755
00:28:07,886 --> 00:28:08,944
[chuckling]

756
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,009
Very nice.

757
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:11,350
We've always tried

758
00:28:11,423 --> 00:28:13,414
to instill a sense of self
in Gaylord

759
00:28:13,491 --> 00:28:15,823
without being
too goal-oriented.

760
00:28:15,894 --> 00:28:17,657
lt's not about
winning or losing,

761
00:28:17,729 --> 00:28:18,718
it's about passion.

762
00:28:19,597 --> 00:28:22,589
We just want him
to love what he's doin'.

763
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:24,066
You know what l mean, Jack?

764
00:28:24,135 --> 00:28:25,534
Not really, Bernard.

765
00:28:25,603 --> 00:28:27,070
l think
a competitive drive

766
00:28:27,138 --> 00:28:28,799
is the essential key
that makes America

767
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:31,467
the only remaining superpower
in the world today.

768
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:34,510
Well, whatever works.
Mmm-hmm.

769
00:28:34,579 --> 00:28:36,638
(Roz)
All right.
Don't forget the positions.

770
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:38,182
Bye, Dr. Roz.
You're a lifesaver.

771
00:28:38,249 --> 00:28:40,444
Oh, Thank you, BJ.
Goodbye.

772
00:28:40,518 --> 00:28:42,042
lra, remember,
easy on the thrusting.

773
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,747
You're not <i>7</i>8 anymore.

774
00:28:43,822 --> 00:28:45,380
(lra)
Bing, bang, bong.

775
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:48,051
What--What kind of work
does your mother
do with those patients?

776
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:50,959
Those look like yoga mats.
ls there yoga involved?

777
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:52,257
lt's yogaesque.

778
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:54,093
lt's sort of, um,

779
00:28:54,165 --> 00:28:55,894
a, um, a--a--a
couples therapy.

780
00:28:55,967 --> 00:28:57,264
Kind of mind-body...

781
00:28:57,335 --> 00:28:58,825
lt's kind of
her own sort of--

782
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:01,565
Rozela! Sweetheart,
living room!

783
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:03,938
Hello! Hello! Hello!

784
00:29:04,008 --> 00:29:06,135
How are you, baby girl?

785
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:07,473
Good, Roz.

786
00:29:07,545 --> 00:29:09,479
God! Look at you,
you're glowing!

787
00:29:09,547 --> 00:29:10,741
Oh, thank you.

788
00:29:10,815 --> 00:29:13,045
Hi, l'm Roz Focker

789
00:29:13,118 --> 00:29:15,712
you must be Jack,
and you must be Dina.

790
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:16,947
Hi.

791
00:29:17,021 --> 00:29:18,352
l--l just can't believe

792
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,084
it's taken us
this long to meet, huh.

793
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:22,416
And who's
this little hairball?

794
00:29:22,494 --> 00:29:24,587
They brought their grandson
Baby Jack along.

795
00:29:24,662 --> 00:29:27,927
He's so adorable.
l could eat him up.

796
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:30,058
Bern, did you show them
where they're sleeping?

797
00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:32,797
Right, right, right.
Because we don't
have any air-conditioning,

798
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:36,204
l made up a nice spot for you
in Roz's office 'cause it
gets the best breeze,

799
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:38,105
and it's very near
the communal commode.

800
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:41,043
Oh, well, you know,
actually, we're gonna
stay in our motor home.

801
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:42,306
ln the trailer?

802
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,348
Come on, Jack.
You're family.

803
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:45,643
We sleep under the same roof.

804
00:29:45,717 --> 00:29:47,685
Actually, Mom's office
is kind of cluttered.

805
00:29:47,752 --> 00:29:49,117
So, that--that
works all right.

806
00:29:49,187 --> 00:29:50,984
lt's just really easier
with Little Jack.

807
00:29:51,055 --> 00:29:52,818
No, no. Really.
We insist.

808
00:29:52,891 --> 00:29:54,415
They wanna sleep
in the trailer,

809
00:29:54,492 --> 00:29:55,823
let them sleep
in the trailer.

810
00:29:55,894 --> 00:29:57,794
Mom, it's not actually--
lt's not a trailer.

811
00:29:57,862 --> 00:30:00,057
lt's kind of like--
lt's like a-- like a
hotel on wheels.

812
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:03,066
This is practically a hotel.
l was gonna do
the turndown service--

813
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:05,125
l know, l know,
but it's their choice.

814
00:30:05,203 --> 00:30:07,467
Wherever you feel
most comfortable is fine.

815
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:09,336
(Bernie)
lt's not right.
Bern, let it go.

816
00:30:09,407 --> 00:30:10,669
Let it go? Fine.

817
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:11,902
Yeah, let it go.

818
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:13,773
Look at you, sulking.

819
00:30:13,845 --> 00:30:15,836
Now, look at this.
l married a teenager. Right?

820
00:30:15,914 --> 00:30:18,280
At least you have the libido
of a teenager.

821
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:20,146
l gave her
a little matinee today--

822
00:30:20,218 --> 00:30:22,152
Oh! Don't you dare!
Stop it!

823
00:30:22,687 --> 00:30:24,518
[chuckling]
How about a double feature?

824
00:30:24,756 --> 00:30:25,745
[laughing]

825
00:30:25,957 --> 00:30:27,618
(Bernie)
Come on. Come on.

826
00:30:27,692 --> 00:30:30,354
Lagoon? Why don't we go
show them the lagoon?

827
00:30:30,428 --> 00:30:32,123
The lagoon.
Come see the lagoon.

828
00:30:32,197 --> 00:30:33,824
The lagoon, Jack. Come on.

829
00:30:33,965 --> 00:30:35,262
We'll get drunk,

830
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:36,994
we'll take a piss
in the lagoon.

831
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:39,537
(Bernie)
Roz, why don't you
take them outside?

832
00:30:39,604 --> 00:30:41,094
Show them around.
l'll make a drink.

833
00:30:48,613 --> 00:30:49,841
Oh, God.

834
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:51,941
(Greg)
Hey, Dad--

835
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:53,608
lt's going good
so far, right?

836
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:56,245
Dad, you gotta take down
that weird shrine thing.

837
00:30:56,321 --> 00:30:57,754
But l'm very proud
of you, Gaylord.

838
00:30:57,822 --> 00:30:59,119
What's wrong with showing it?

839
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,521
lt's ridiculous.

840
00:31:00,592 --> 00:31:02,753
Most people aren't proud
of sixth place ribbons.

841
00:31:02,827 --> 00:31:03,816
Most people?

842
00:31:03,895 --> 00:31:05,624
Since when do you care
about most people?

843
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:08,791
l don't, but Jack
is really into winning

844
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:10,664
and competition and sports.

845
00:31:10,735 --> 00:31:12,498
lt's a whole other thing
with him.

846
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:15,232
Hey. Hey. You're a winner
up here and in here.

847
00:31:15,306 --> 00:31:17,069
And that's all that matters.

848
00:31:17,141 --> 00:31:18,574
Okay. Thank you.

849
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,610
l don't know what that means,
but thank you.

850
00:31:21,145 --> 00:31:22,134
(Jack)
So, to solve that problem,

851
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:25,205
l created a life-like
latex left breast

852
00:31:25,283 --> 00:31:27,683
molded from his mother's
actual left breast,

853
00:31:27,752 --> 00:31:30,346
so this way LJ would avoid
any nipple confusion.

854
00:31:30,421 --> 00:31:34,482
You're avoiding confusion
by strapping a boob on a man?

855
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:35,924
Well, yes, believe it or not,

856
00:31:35,994 --> 00:31:37,894
it is less confusing
because of the texture

857
00:31:37,962 --> 00:31:39,020
Mom.

858
00:31:39,097 --> 00:31:41,065
...of the breast itself.

859
00:31:41,132 --> 00:31:45,034
Uh, l guess it's very,
uh, creative.

860
00:31:45,103 --> 00:31:46,092
lt's very creative.

861
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:48,434
§§[Bernie humming]

862
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:52,875
A little birdie told me
that one of our guests here

863
00:31:52,944 --> 00:31:54,844
is a Tom Collins man.

864
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,210
[all laughing]

865
00:31:56,281 --> 00:31:57,475
Oh, for pity's sake.

866
00:31:57,548 --> 00:31:59,175
lsn't that nice, Jack?

867
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,877
That is nice. Thank you.

868
00:32:00,952 --> 00:32:04,410
(Bernie)
All right. Wait. Don't drink.
l want to make a toast.

869
00:32:06,024 --> 00:32:09,323
Now,
l had a vasectomy in 19<i>7</i> 4...

870
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:10,452
'<i>7</i>3, honey.

871
00:32:10,528 --> 00:32:11,688
You're right. '<i>7</i>3.

872
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:14,561
So, unfortunately,
l never had the chance
to procreate a daughter,

873
00:32:14,632 --> 00:32:15,860
but had l been able to,

874
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,562
l really
would've wanted a girl

875
00:32:18,636 --> 00:32:21,002
as sensitive
and as intelligent

876
00:32:21,172 --> 00:32:22,639
and as beautiful

877
00:32:22,907 --> 00:32:26,035
as this young lady
sitting right here before us.

878
00:32:26,511 --> 00:32:27,637
Thank you, Bernie.

879
00:32:27,712 --> 00:32:28,906
And if l might add...

880
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,004
Greg.

881
00:32:30,415 --> 00:32:31,473
Yeah.

882
00:32:31,916 --> 00:32:33,383
l thought you had a sister?

883
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:35,476
Nope. No sister.

884
00:32:36,154 --> 00:32:37,621
You said you had a sister.

885
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:39,919
You said
you milked your sister's cat.

886
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:48,393
(Bernie)
Okay, l'm not done yet.
What l'm trying to say is,

887
00:32:48,499 --> 00:32:51,263
it's taken far too long
to do this, you know,

888
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:53,528
but we're finally
all together.

889
00:32:54,105 --> 00:32:55,572
(Roz)
That's nice, honey.

890
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,199
Oh, thank you.

891
00:32:59,544 --> 00:33:00,909
All right, that's enough.

892
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,606
L'chaim, everyone.

893
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,874
(all)
L'chaim!

894
00:33:03,948 --> 00:33:05,347
L'ha-ha.

895
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:08,317
Like you have popcorn
stuck in the throat. lt's a...

896
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:10,009
Okay. To family.

897
00:33:10,088 --> 00:33:11,783
[all laughing]

898
00:33:12,023 --> 00:33:13,012
To family.

899
00:33:13,124 --> 00:33:14,148
Oh! l forgot.

900
00:33:14,225 --> 00:33:16,318
l want to say one more
thing about my vasectomy.

901
00:33:16,394 --> 00:33:17,622
(Roz)
Sit down.

902
00:33:17,695 --> 00:33:20,027
Honey,
get yourself over here.

903
00:33:20,098 --> 00:33:21,087
l went overboard?

904
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:22,154
(Roz)
A little bit.

905
00:33:22,233 --> 00:33:25,031
You're so cute,
they'll forgive you anything.

906
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:27,203
(Bernie)
God! You're so beautiful.

907
00:33:27,271 --> 00:33:29,671
[whispering]
You are the sexiest woman
alive l know.

908
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:32,608
Mmm. You're just trying to
get me back into bed.

909
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:33,837
(Bernie)
Or the hammock.

910
00:33:33,911 --> 00:33:34,969
[clearing throat]

911
00:33:35,046 --> 00:33:36,809
This is
a delicious Tom Collins.

912
00:33:36,881 --> 00:33:39,213
What l did,
l used real lemon juice.

913
00:33:39,283 --> 00:33:41,274
lt's from our trees here.
That's the secret.

914
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:43,183
He was squeezing
all afternoon.

915
00:33:43,254 --> 00:33:44,414
Yeah. And, Jack,

916
00:33:44,489 --> 00:33:46,252
l managed to make some
lemon juice, too.

917
00:33:46,324 --> 00:33:47,916
[both laughing]

918
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,988
[gasping]

919
00:33:50,061 --> 00:33:51,619
(Bernie)
Gay, you all right?

920
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:53,323
Honey, you okay?
Are you sure?

921
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:55,631
[frogs croaking]

922
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:01,728
Well, l think

923
00:34:01,806 --> 00:34:04,900
that Roz and Bernie seem like
very nice people.

924
00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:06,773
Oh! Very nice people.

925
00:34:07,178 --> 00:34:09,169
A little off-color,
but very nice.

926
00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:11,044
Oh! But isn't it
wonderful, Jack?

927
00:34:11,115 --> 00:34:12,514
After all this buildup,

928
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:14,210
the kids
are finally getting married.

929
00:34:14,285 --> 00:34:15,912
l feel so happy.

930
00:34:15,987 --> 00:34:17,921
Wait a second.
l think he just spoke.

931
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:20,480
Little Jack,
were you about to speak?

932
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:21,547
[farts]

933
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:24,952
Nope,
just a little flatulence.

934
00:34:25,029 --> 00:34:26,519
What were you saying, honey?

935
00:34:26,597 --> 00:34:27,894
Nothing, dear.

936
00:34:29,767 --> 00:34:32,429
Guys, where are you going?

937
00:34:32,503 --> 00:34:35,233
We're checking out
Jack's macho-wacho trailer.

938
00:34:35,306 --> 00:34:36,898
Yeah.
l want to see that boob.

939
00:34:36,974 --> 00:34:39,067
Can l talk to you
for a sec?
Yeah.

940
00:34:39,143 --> 00:34:41,475
Hey, listen,
don't let Moses go in there.
They have a cat.

941
00:34:41,546 --> 00:34:43,207
Moses is perfectly trained--

942
00:34:43,281 --> 00:34:45,044
Dad, he humps
everything that moves.

943
00:34:45,116 --> 00:34:46,413
Honey,
he's like his father.

944
00:34:46,484 --> 00:34:47,746
l never cheated on you.

945
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:49,912
They're not listening to me.

946
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:53,984
So, what's up?

947
00:34:54,058 --> 00:34:56,390
They seem to be
getting along really well,
don't you think?

948
00:34:56,461 --> 00:34:59,191
Yeah, they do. l know.
l kind of feel bad
that l worried so much.

949
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:00,662
Yeah. That was okay.

950
00:35:00,731 --> 00:35:02,028
What's going on?

951
00:35:03,534 --> 00:35:04,762
l'm pregnant.

952
00:35:04,902 --> 00:35:06,665
You're pregnant?
Mmm-hmm.

953
00:35:07,371 --> 00:35:09,271
l'm two weeks late.
l'm nauseous,

954
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:11,171
my boobs hurt,
and l can smell everything.

955
00:35:11,242 --> 00:35:13,870
You're gonna have a baby.
Yeah. A baby.

956
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,776
Oh, we're gonna
have a little baby, a baby.

957
00:35:15,847 --> 00:35:17,007
l'm pregnant.

958
00:35:17,081 --> 00:35:18,548
l just-- l...

959
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:20,175
[laughing]

960
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:22,775
Yeah.

961
00:35:24,856 --> 00:35:26,016
Oh, shit!

962
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:30,792
You realize your father
is going to kill me?

963
00:35:31,162 --> 00:35:32,629
No, no, no, no, no.

964
00:35:32,697 --> 00:35:35,188
He's not gonna find out
because we're
not going to tell him.

965
00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:37,757
No, no, no, no, no.
Come on.
He's a human lie detector.

966
00:35:37,835 --> 00:35:39,427
He lives to sniff out
stuff like this.

967
00:35:39,504 --> 00:35:40,732
We'll get
through this weekend,

968
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:41,897
we'll get through tomorrow.

969
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:44,271
And--and--and we'll
tell them on Sunday
before we go.

970
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:45,434
Okay? We'll tell them all.

971
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:48,001
l just hate the idea
of keeping secrets
from your dad.

972
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:50,070
lt's just one little secret.

973
00:35:50,915 --> 00:35:52,382
Oh! Hi, neighbors.

974
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:53,576
Hello.

975
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:54,879
The Fockers, honey.

976
00:35:54,952 --> 00:35:56,419
A la fancy-shmancy.

977
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:57,852
Welcome to the chateau.

978
00:35:57,922 --> 00:36:00,083
No wonder they
don't want to sleep
in our shit box.

979
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:01,420
Look at this place.

980
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:02,516
[Moses barking]

981
00:36:02,593 --> 00:36:05,084
l--l don't think the dog
is such a good idea.

982
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,688
Don't worry. Moses is more
of a lover than a fighter.

983
00:36:07,765 --> 00:36:09,392
Jesus!
Moses!

984
00:36:09,467 --> 00:36:11,833
He's always dreamt of me
having a white wedding.

985
00:36:11,903 --> 00:36:13,564
You don't know how upset
he's gonna be.

986
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:14,696
No, l do know.

987
00:36:14,772 --> 00:36:17,036
(Bernie)
Moses! Moses!

988
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:18,132
(Jack)
Jinxy!

989
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:20,302
(Greg)
Dad, l told you
to keep him out of the RV.

990
00:36:20,378 --> 00:36:21,743
He said he
wanted to see the RV.

991
00:36:21,812 --> 00:36:22,836
Dad!

992
00:36:22,914 --> 00:36:24,006
Moses! Moses!

993
00:36:24,081 --> 00:36:26,379
(Jack)
Get that goddamn dog
out of here!

994
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:30,609
Mo!

995
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,350
(Bernie)
Oh, God!

996
00:36:33,424 --> 00:36:34,618
Dad!

997
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:35,852
[Moses whimpering]

998
00:36:35,927 --> 00:36:36,916
(Greg)
Oh! Jinx.

999
00:36:36,994 --> 00:36:37,983
Jinx, don't do it.

1000
00:36:38,062 --> 00:36:39,051
Jinxy, no.

1001
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:40,119
Don't do it!

1002
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:41,187
(all three)
No!

1003
00:36:41,265 --> 00:36:42,425
[whimpering]

1004
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:45,264
Jesus! Moses! Hold on.

1005
00:36:49,106 --> 00:36:50,903
Moses, hold on.
l'm gonna save you!

1006
00:36:50,975 --> 00:36:52,374
The cat can flush?

1007
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:54,072
Oh, my God!

1008
00:36:54,145 --> 00:36:55,510
[Little Jack wailing]

1009
00:36:56,013 --> 00:36:57,071
Get out of the way!

1010
00:36:57,148 --> 00:36:59,378
(Jack)
Hey! What the hell are
you doing? That's my toilet!

1011
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:00,542
l got to get my dog!

1012
00:37:00,618 --> 00:37:02,552
Forget your dog.
What about my toilet?

1013
00:37:03,321 --> 00:37:04,310
Moses!

1014
00:37:04,488 --> 00:37:05,477

(Pam)
No! Stop the baby!
Stop the baby!

1018
00:37:11,095 --> 00:37:12,084
[screaming]

1019
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,565
[wailing continues]

1020
00:37:20,638 --> 00:37:21,832
(Bernie)
He's alive!

1021
00:37:23,274 --> 00:37:24,468
He's fine.

1022
00:37:24,542 --> 00:37:27,102
So much for the protection
of our rolling safe house.

1023
00:37:27,178 --> 00:37:29,840
Oh, honey, he was trying
to save his pet.

1024
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,404
l mean, what if it was Jinxy

1025
00:37:31,482 --> 00:37:32,881
who got flushed
into a toilet?

1026
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:35,145
Mr. Jinx has had
extensive aquatic training.

1027
00:37:35,219 --> 00:37:38,120
He would have known
exactly what to do
in the event of a submersion.

1028
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:39,213
[purring]

20-minute warning for dinner,
guys.

1032
00:37:45,229 --> 00:37:47,163
Sorry about
the trailer, Jack.

1033
00:37:48,299 --> 00:37:50,062
[whispering]
Muskrat.

1034
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:53,803
lt's okay, Bernard.

1035
00:37:53,871 --> 00:37:55,133
[growling]

1036
00:37:55,473 --> 00:37:57,532
There's no way
we're not telling him
this weekend.

1037
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:59,235
l know.
That's what l was saying.

1038
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:00,368
So, what do you wanna do?

1039
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:02,469
l'm not sure.
l never thought
this'd be an issue.

1040
00:38:02,546 --> 00:38:04,537
l thought we'd be married
before we got pregnant.

1041
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:05,877
Hey.
What?

1042
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,446
Why don't we move
the wedding up to next month?

1043
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,578
What?

1044
00:38:10,655 --> 00:38:11,747
Then we'll tell your dad

1045
00:38:11,822 --> 00:38:13,790
you got pregnant
on the honeymoon.

1046
00:38:13,924 --> 00:38:15,983
Oh, my God, yeah,
that could work.

1047
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,550
Yeah. lt's perfect,
right?
Yeah.

1048
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:19,027
Okay. Good.
Just follow my lead.

1049
00:38:19,096 --> 00:38:20,586
Okay.
Okay.

1050
00:38:21,766 --> 00:38:23,028
§§[humming]

1051
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:26,035
Without further ado,
my famous Focker Fondue.

1052
00:38:26,103 --> 00:38:27,468
[all applauding]

1053
00:38:27,538 --> 00:38:29,631
Come on, dig in. Come on.
Get it while it's hot.

1054
00:38:29,707 --> 00:38:32,870
That is so impressive, Bernie.
Did you do that yourself?

1055
00:38:32,943 --> 00:38:34,843
Oh, sure.
Oh! l love to cook.

1056
00:38:34,912 --> 00:38:36,038
l can't even fry an egg.

1057
00:38:36,113 --> 00:38:37,102
(Bernie)
True.

1058
00:38:37,181 --> 00:38:38,341
l burn cornflakes.

1059
00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:40,675
l'm amazed
he finds the time to cook

1060
00:38:40,751 --> 00:38:42,776
with such a high-powered
legal career.

1061
00:38:42,953 --> 00:38:44,011
High-powered?

1062
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:45,645
l wouldn't exactly call--
Uh-oh!

1063
00:38:45,723 --> 00:38:47,520
You kicked me.
Why did you kick me?

1064
00:38:47,591 --> 00:38:50,856
l kick--kicked you
because you're being modest

1065
00:38:50,928 --> 00:38:53,726
and you should tell people
that you are a good lawyer,
which he is,

1066
00:38:53,798 --> 00:38:55,356
a-a-and he has fought

1067
00:38:55,533 --> 00:38:57,364
some really big,
important legal battles.

1068
00:38:57,435 --> 00:38:59,767
Truth is, Jack,
when Gay was born,
l stopped practicing

1069
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:02,203
and became
a stay-at-home dad.

1070
00:39:02,306 --> 00:39:03,466
Oh, believe me,

1071
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:05,133
he won a trial or two
in his day.

1072
00:39:05,209 --> 00:39:06,904
Oh!
Extremely good trial lawyer.

1073
00:39:06,977 --> 00:39:08,501
A regular Clarence Darrow.

1074
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:10,046
So Roz was
the primary breadwinner

1075
00:39:10,114 --> 00:39:11,672
and you didn't have a job?

1076
00:39:11,749 --> 00:39:12,943
(Pam)
Dad.

1077
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:16,180
Honey, come on, you could say
he had the hardest job.

1078
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,912
Oh, he's--he's just kidding.

1079
00:39:17,988 --> 00:39:19,250
Of course, l'm... Yes.

1080
00:39:19,323 --> 00:39:21,689
Why don't we jump into
the topic of the hour, hmm,

1081
00:39:21,759 --> 00:39:23,021
the big
Focker-Byrnes wedding.

1082
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:24,288
Yes. Good.

1083
00:39:24,929 --> 00:39:27,523
l know we've been talking
about a--a fall wedding...

1084
00:39:27,598 --> 00:39:29,896
[Bernie speaking in Spanish]

1085
00:39:29,967 --> 00:39:31,229
[woman speaking in Spanish]

1086
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:32,530
ls that lsabel?

1087
00:39:32,603 --> 00:39:34,867
Oh, yeah. Our former
housekeeper, lsabel.

1088
00:39:34,939 --> 00:39:37,635
You know, she has
her own catering business now,
isn't that great?

1089
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:40,734
And--and l asked her
to come and help Bernie
in the kitchen this weekend.

1090
00:39:40,811 --> 00:39:42,142
You didn't tell me
she was here.

1091
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:44,238
Gay had a monster crush
on her
when he was a teenager.

1092
00:39:44,315 --> 00:39:45,339
(Pam)
Really?

1093
00:39:45,416 --> 00:39:47,077
l didn't have
any monster crush.

1094
00:39:47,151 --> 00:39:48,550
You didn't tell me
about that.

1095
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:49,711
Yeah. Because it's not true.

1096
00:39:49,787 --> 00:39:52,779
Oh, not true? Then l didn't
catch you doing baziga
to her passport photo

1097
00:39:52,857 --> 00:39:53,881
when you were, what, 13?

1098
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:54,947
(Roz)
Honey, stop.

1099
00:39:55,025 --> 00:39:56,322
(Bernie)
l walk in the door...

1100
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:57,486
(lsabel)
Where is he?

1101
00:39:57,561 --> 00:39:59,119
Oh, there's my baby!

1102
00:39:59,196 --> 00:40:00,288
Hey!

1103
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:03,122
[laughs]

1104
00:40:03,834 --> 00:40:05,461
[both exclaiming]

1105
00:40:05,536 --> 00:40:06,935
Good to see you.

1106
00:40:07,438 --> 00:40:08,427
Mmm. Good to see you.

1107
00:40:08,506 --> 00:40:10,098
l--l haven't
seen you in years.

1108
00:40:10,174 --> 00:40:11,163
l know.

1109
00:40:11,308 --> 00:40:12,707
Mmm.
Yes, you...

1110
00:40:12,777 --> 00:40:15,041
Wow! Yeah. Look at you.
You look...

1111
00:40:15,112 --> 00:40:16,136
l know.

1112
00:40:16,213 --> 00:40:17,237
Yeah. You look...

1113
00:40:17,314 --> 00:40:18,542
l had a boob job.
Wow.

1114
00:40:18,616 --> 00:40:19,810
[cooing]

1115
00:40:19,884 --> 00:40:21,317
Yeah. Yeah.

1116
00:40:21,786 --> 00:40:24,311
Hey! This is, uh,
Dina and Jack Byrnes.

1117
00:40:24,388 --> 00:40:25,446
<i>Mucho gusto.</i>

1118
00:40:25,523 --> 00:40:26,512
Hi, lsabel.

1119
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:27,579
<i>Mucho gusto.</i>

1120
00:40:27,658 --> 00:40:30,627
And this is Pam Byrnes,
my fiancee.

1121
00:40:30,694 --> 00:40:32,685
<i>Encantada.</i>

1122
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:34,628
Nice to meet you, too.

1123
00:40:35,232 --> 00:40:38,668
Not yet married,
and already a little one?

1124
00:40:39,336 --> 00:40:41,804
And he is
a handsome little Focker.

1125
00:40:41,872 --> 00:40:42,930
[laughs]

1126
00:40:43,007 --> 00:40:44,031
See?

1127
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:45,370
Oh, no. He's not a Focker.

1128
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:46,808
Yeah, no.
He's not mine.

1129
00:40:46,877 --> 00:40:49,368
And still you stayed
to raise her child?

1130
00:40:49,547 --> 00:40:50,571
Good for you.

1131
00:40:50,648 --> 00:40:52,013
No, he's Pam's nephew.

1132
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:54,584
He has no connection
to Greg whatsoever.

1133
00:40:54,819 --> 00:40:56,252

1134
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:57,614

[all laughing]

1139
00:41:04,228 --> 00:41:05,695
Little Jack, no.

1140
00:41:05,763 --> 00:41:07,196
Those aren't for you.

1141
00:41:07,832 --> 00:41:10,062

Oh.

Mom.

1145
00:41:14,004 --> 00:41:16,199
l think l'll take
him inside.

1146
00:41:16,507 --> 00:41:17,735
(Jack)
Good idea.

1147
00:41:20,444 --> 00:41:23,379
You're a very
lucky woman, Pam.

1148
00:41:23,447 --> 00:41:25,540
He's very special,
this one.

1149
00:41:25,883 --> 00:41:26,907
[laughing]

1150
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:28,747
l think so, too.

1151
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:31,185
Oh, l could tell you
some stories about him.

1152
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:32,415
Really?

1153
00:41:33,057 --> 00:41:34,991
Oh, she's just
being silly.

1154
00:41:35,125 --> 00:41:36,786
Nice to meet you all.

1155
00:41:36,861 --> 00:41:38,328
Nice to meet you.

1156
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:41,056
So sweet. Oh! So sweet.

1157
00:41:41,365 --> 00:41:42,730
[clears throat]

1158
00:41:43,367 --> 00:41:45,631
Hey, do you guys
want some more, uh, wine?

1159
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:49,171
<i>Mas vino por la mama, si.</i>

1160
00:41:49,607 --> 00:41:50,596
Hey.

1161
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:53,070
Hey, you did good, Greg.

1162
00:41:53,143 --> 00:41:55,111
She's very pretty,
this one, huh?

1163
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:57,579
Yeah, she's, uh,
she's really great.

1164
00:41:57,648 --> 00:41:58,672
Really great.

1165
00:41:58,749 --> 00:42:01,377
Can you believe
it's been 15 years?

[speaking in Spanish]

1167
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:05,620
So many wonderful memories
from those days.

1168
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:08,123
Yes. Yes, lot of wonderful,

1169
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:11,889
kind of private memories.

1170
00:42:11,962 --> 00:42:16,228
So, you never told
your fiancee about us, huh?

1171
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:17,995
Um, no, l don't think l did.

1172
00:42:18,068 --> 00:42:20,434
l don't, l think,
l don't think it ever
came up on my end.

1173
00:42:20,504 --> 00:42:22,904
Not that l didn't
want her to know.
lt just, never really...

1174
00:42:22,973 --> 00:42:25,271
Yeah, and not that, l--l mean,
not that it wasn't great.

1175
00:42:25,342 --> 00:42:27,572
lt was really, you know,
for me it was like...

1176
00:42:27,645 --> 00:42:29,078
And you were so

1177
00:42:29,146 --> 00:42:30,738
helpful and--and--

1178
00:42:30,814 --> 00:42:32,145
Don't you worry, baby.

1179
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:33,683
Your secret's safe with me.

1180
00:42:33,784 --> 00:42:34,773
Okay.

1181
00:42:35,085 --> 00:42:36,575
There's no secrets.
But, good, yeah,

1182
00:42:36,654 --> 00:42:38,679
maybe if we keep it quiet
this weekend and then...

1183
00:42:38,756 --> 00:42:40,849
Because, yeah, l don't want
Pam to feel uncomfortable.

1184
00:42:40,925 --> 00:42:43,917
And then later, when it's
the proper, you know, setting,
l can...

1185
00:42:43,994 --> 00:42:46,554
Okay, yeah, okay, good.
And, uh...

1186
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:47,886
Good.

1187
00:42:48,132 --> 00:42:51,226
Oh, and fondue, fondue
is going-- is goin' over.

1188
00:42:51,302 --> 00:42:53,600
Gay, you're just in time
to hear me tell the gang

1189
00:42:53,671 --> 00:42:55,662
how you lost
your virginity to lsabel.

1190
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:57,229
[door closing]

1191
00:42:58,442 --> 00:43:00,910
(Bernie)
He was 19. A late bloomer.

1192
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:03,777
You s-slept with lsabel?

1193
00:43:03,847 --> 00:43:05,439
We were relieved.

1194
00:43:05,983 --> 00:43:07,974
Why--why would you,
why--why would you
bring that up?

1195
00:43:08,052 --> 00:43:09,076
What's the problem?

1196
00:43:09,153 --> 00:43:10,518
lt was, what, 15 years ago.

1197
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:12,021
Honey, your father thought

1198
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:13,420
that it'd be fun
to share stories

1199
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:14,752
about our first time.

1200
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:17,485
Really? That sounds like fun.
That's...

1201
00:43:17,561 --> 00:43:19,256
That's fine.

1202
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:21,798
Come on, tell us how
you popped your cherry.
Come on.

1203
00:43:22,499 --> 00:43:23,796
l really don't feel
comfortable

1204
00:43:23,867 --> 00:43:25,334
discussing that
with you, Bernard.

1205
00:43:25,402 --> 00:43:28,303
You know what? l suggest that
we get back to talking
about the wedding.

1206
00:43:28,372 --> 00:43:29,839
Thank you, Bernie.

1207
00:43:29,907 --> 00:43:31,067
[Little Jack wailing]

1208
00:43:31,141 --> 00:43:32,267
What?

1209
00:43:32,343 --> 00:43:34,573
Mom, didn't you just take
Little Jack back to the room?

1210
00:43:34,645 --> 00:43:36,476
l'm monitoring him
from a high-powered

1211
00:43:36,547 --> 00:43:38,811
multidirectional microphone
planted in his crib.

1212
00:43:38,882 --> 00:43:41,510
Oh, baby monitors.
Hidden cameras.

1213
00:43:41,585 --> 00:43:43,883
Whatever happened
to a little thing
called privacy?

1214
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:46,013
Bernie,
surveillance technology
has helped protect

1215
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:47,318
a lot of the freedoms

1216
00:43:47,391 --> 00:43:49,325
that we as Americans
take advantage of today.

1217
00:43:52,997 --> 00:43:54,988
He's right.
lt has been good.

1218
00:43:57,668 --> 00:43:59,966
S-son, that is bullcrap
in a chef's salad.

1219
00:44:00,037 --> 00:44:02,870
Jack, tell me one smart thing
the CLlA has done

1220
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:05,306
and l'll give you
the deed to her house.

1221
00:44:05,376 --> 00:44:06,673
The CLlA?

1222
00:44:06,744 --> 00:44:08,974
The Central Lack
of lntelligence Agency.

1223
00:44:09,613 --> 00:44:11,274
[Bernie and Roz laughing]

1224
00:44:14,451 --> 00:44:15,975
[Little Jack wailing]

1225
00:44:18,589 --> 00:44:20,614
l think that baby might need
a couple of pulls

1226
00:44:20,691 --> 00:44:22,249
on that knocker
of yours, Jack.

1227
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:24,923
[both laughing]

1228
00:44:25,062 --> 00:44:26,086
No, it's okay.

1229
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:27,255
We're Ferberizing him.

1230
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:28,821
You're what?
The Ferber method.

1231
00:44:28,899 --> 00:44:31,629
You let him cry it out.
This way he doesn't
depend on coddling.

1232
00:44:31,702 --> 00:44:33,966
On the other hand,
the Continuum Concept

1233
00:44:34,038 --> 00:44:35,801
shows that a baby benefits

1234
00:44:35,873 --> 00:44:38,273
more from constant
physical contact.

1235
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:39,331
Oh.

1236
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:41,777
We use the Ferber Method.

1237
00:44:41,912 --> 00:44:43,379
We used the Focker Method.

1238
00:44:43,614 --> 00:44:45,343
We hugged and kissed
that little prince

1239
00:44:45,416 --> 00:44:47,111
like there was no tomorrow.

1240
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:48,651
We Fockerized him.

1241
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:50,813
That's right.

1242
00:44:50,888 --> 00:44:53,015
Greggy practically slept
in our bed till he was 10.

1243
00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:54,079
Oh, my God!

1244
00:44:54,158 --> 00:44:55,887
Oh, l don't think
it was quite that long.

1245
00:44:55,959 --> 00:44:56,948
Yes, it was.

1246
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:58,051
No, it wasn't 10.

1247
00:44:58,128 --> 00:44:59,755
Nine-and-a-half, at least.

1248
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:00,956
Mom, l don't think so.

1249
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:03,261
l didn't sleep
in their bed all that time.

1250
00:45:03,333 --> 00:45:04,766
(Roz)
Bernie, get the photo album.

1251
00:45:04,835 --> 00:45:05,961
l'm one step ahead of you.

1252
00:45:06,036 --> 00:45:08,869
No, no, no,
we're eating dinner, come on.

1253
00:45:09,807 --> 00:45:11,240
These are the curls

1254
00:45:11,308 --> 00:45:13,105
from his first trip
to the barbershop.

1255
00:45:13,177 --> 00:45:14,906
Nobody wants to see this.

1256
00:45:14,978 --> 00:45:16,843
Oh, and you kept
all of his baby teeth.

1257
00:45:16,914 --> 00:45:18,643
Look at his
darling little teeth,

1258
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:20,843
isn't that sweet?

1259
00:45:20,918 --> 00:45:24,081
Uh-oh, somebody looks
very grumpy there.

1260
00:45:24,154 --> 00:45:25,746
Oh, that's Gay with the mohel.

1261
00:45:25,823 --> 00:45:26,915
The mohel?
No.

1262
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:30,187
(Roz)
He's the man who snips
the baby's little winkydink.

1263
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:32,820
See, that's Greg getting
circumcised, right here.

1264
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:34,955
We had the ceremony
at my parents' house

1265
00:45:35,032 --> 00:45:36,863
but there was a cold snap
and... Tell him.

1266
00:45:36,934 --> 00:45:38,060
The heater conked out.

1267
00:45:38,135 --> 00:45:39,159
Mom.

1268
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:41,636
No matter how hard he tried,
the mohel couldn't coax

1269
00:45:41,705 --> 00:45:44,003
Greg's tiny little turtle
from its shell.

1270
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:46,542
You know what?
Let's not talk about
the tiny turtle, okay?

1271
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:47,770
Let's... Th-this is dinner.

1272
00:45:47,845 --> 00:45:50,575
Honey, half the people
at this table have penises.

1273
00:45:50,647 --> 00:45:52,376
Mom, control yourself.

1274
00:45:52,449 --> 00:45:54,917
Roz, he's right.
You're embarrassing him.

1275
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:56,784
Okay, l'm sorry.

1276
00:45:56,854 --> 00:45:59,982
Make a long story short, Jack,
he wound up with a semicirc.

1277
00:46:01,391 --> 00:46:02,415
[giggling]

1278
00:46:02,493 --> 00:46:03,755
What's a semicirc?

1279
00:46:03,827 --> 00:46:05,089
l can't wait to hear this.

1280
00:46:05,162 --> 00:46:08,131
What? lt's a cross between
an ant eater and--

1281
00:46:08,198 --> 00:46:09,665
A German Army helmet.

1282
00:46:09,733 --> 00:46:11,257
[all laughing]

1283
00:46:13,303 --> 00:46:14,793
But, honey... Oh!

1284
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:18,101
You wanted to talk
about the wedding, right?

1285
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:22,906
Don't tell me you kept
his umbilical cord.

1286
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:25,278
Of course not,
that's Greg's foreskin.

1287
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:28,918
All right, you know what?
That's it. That's--that's
enough humiliation.

1288
00:46:28,986 --> 00:46:30,283
Honey, stop.
We're having fun.

1289
00:46:30,354 --> 00:46:31,343
No, l'm not having fun.

1290
00:46:31,421 --> 00:46:32,285
Why deny us our memories?

1291
00:46:32,356 --> 00:46:33,345
Because we're done!

1292
00:46:33,924 --> 00:46:35,050
[all screaming]

1293
00:46:35,159 --> 00:46:36,148
[sizzling]

1294
00:46:41,665 --> 00:46:43,656
Anyone in the mood
for Chinese?

1295
00:46:45,369 --> 00:46:46,358
You told me
your first time

1296
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:49,568
was with the Danish
transfer student
in high school.

1297
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,471
Yeah, well, you weren't
exactly forthcoming

1298
00:46:51,542 --> 00:46:52,907
about your engagement
with Kevin.

1299
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:54,910
Yeah, well,
he wasn't my babysitter.

1300
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:56,707
Okay, l should have
told you, all right.

1301
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:58,338
Can we just let
it go, please?

1302
00:46:58,415 --> 00:47:01,282
We both got
enough stuff to deal with
this weekend.

1303
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:07,415
Oh, hi, Jack.

1304
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:08,515
Hello, Greg.

1305
00:47:08,592 --> 00:47:09,581
[sighs]

1306
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:10,854
Funny dinner, huh?

1307
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:13,057
How do you mean?

1308
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:15,894
l know that you are
studying my family
like the frozen caveman.

1309
00:47:15,966 --> 00:47:18,025
So, l just, l don't want
you to be worried, okay?

1310
00:47:18,101 --> 00:47:20,729
l mean, they're
a little quirky,

1311
00:47:20,804 --> 00:47:22,431
but they-they're
well-intentioned

1312
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:24,497
and--and l think
they're just nervous and...

1313
00:47:24,575 --> 00:47:26,941
Greg, l am sure tomorrow
will be a better day.

1314
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:28,375
(Bernie)
l'm sorry, ma'am.

1315
00:47:28,445 --> 00:47:30,310
l thought you
ordered room service.

1316
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:31,677
Are you sure
you don't want

1317
00:47:31,748 --> 00:47:33,682
any whipped cream
with your sundae?

1318
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:34,739
[Roz screaming]

1319
00:47:34,818 --> 00:47:35,876
(Roz)
Bern, stop it!

1320
00:47:35,953 --> 00:47:38,046
Who's Bern?
l'm Chad, the bellhop.

1321
00:47:38,121 --> 00:47:39,884
Oh, no, come on,
we did that last week.

1322
00:47:39,957 --> 00:47:41,822
Can't you be
Sam the carpet-cleaning man?

1323
00:47:41,892 --> 00:47:44,622
lt's illogical.
Why would a carpet cleaner
have whipped cream?

1324
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:45,821
Well, improvise, honey.

1325
00:47:45,896 --> 00:47:46,885
Good evening, miss.

1326
00:47:46,964 --> 00:47:48,295
l'm here to clean
your carpet.

1327
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:50,196
[Bernie and Roz laughing]

1328
00:47:50,267 --> 00:47:52,997
Do you mind if l put some
foam down on your rug?

1329
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:54,401
l don't mind at all.

1330
00:47:54,471 --> 00:47:55,495
Good night, Greg.

1331
00:47:55,572 --> 00:47:56,596
Okay, sleep well, Jack.

1332
00:47:56,673 --> 00:47:58,937
(Roz)
How long-- how long have you
worked in this hotel?

1333
00:47:59,643 --> 00:48:01,838
lt's time to put some snow
on your mountains.

1334
00:48:01,912 --> 00:48:03,641
Come on, l'm gonna get
some whipped cream

1335
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:04,703
on those Tetons.

1336
00:48:04,781 --> 00:48:06,578
[Bernie and Roz laughing]

1337
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:07,617
Guys!

1338
00:48:07,684 --> 00:48:09,584
(Roz)
Come back in the morning,
tootsie roll.

1339
00:48:09,653 --> 00:48:11,644
(Bernie)
Gay, you see
the cowboy hat on the door?

1340
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:13,087
Cowboy hat is off the door!

1341
00:48:13,156 --> 00:48:14,555
No cowboy hat this weekend!

1342
00:48:14,625 --> 00:48:15,853
l'm coming in!

1343
00:48:15,926 --> 00:48:17,826
Just stop doing
what you're doing!

1344
00:48:18,829 --> 00:48:19,853
Oh!

1345
00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:21,158
Come on, man, you know

1346
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:23,563
what that cowboy hat
on the door means.

1347
00:48:23,634 --> 00:48:25,124
Will you please
help me out here?

1348
00:48:25,202 --> 00:48:27,067
What?
We're just being ourselves.

1349
00:48:27,137 --> 00:48:28,331
Mom, mom, please...

1350
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:30,100
l think he's saying
not to be ourselves.

1351
00:48:30,173 --> 00:48:31,231
Yes, be yourselves

1352
00:48:31,308 --> 00:48:32,775
but be yourself in a way

1353
00:48:32,843 --> 00:48:35,073
that's a little less than
being your full selves, okay.

1354
00:48:35,145 --> 00:48:36,476
(Roz)
l don't understand this.

1355
00:48:36,546 --> 00:48:38,343
l mean, why you're so
afraid of this Jack?

1356
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:40,576
You've been kissing his ass
ever since you got here.

1357
00:48:40,651 --> 00:48:41,982
Mom, l'm not afraid
of him, okay.

1358
00:48:42,052 --> 00:48:43,076
lt's not true.
lt is true.

1359
00:48:43,153 --> 00:48:45,383
(Bernie)
l can't believe you went
duck-hunting with him.

1360
00:48:45,455 --> 00:48:46,854
Our people
don't shoot ducks.

1361
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:49,449
Just make Jack feel a little
more comfortable here, okay?

1362
00:48:49,526 --> 00:48:51,050
So you don't want us
to be ourselves?

1363
00:48:51,128 --> 00:48:53,153
No, l just don't want you
to break his RV, Dad,

1364
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:55,289
and--and--and reveal
that l had sex with lsabel

1365
00:48:55,365 --> 00:48:58,198
and play weird sex games
that everybody can hear
in the house.

1366
00:48:58,268 --> 00:48:59,292
Mom... Mom, please.

1367
00:48:59,369 --> 00:49:01,394
lf you ask me,
it wouldn't be so bad

1368
00:49:01,471 --> 00:49:02,961
if your future in-laws
heard this.

1369
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,029
Do me a favor.

1370
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:06,735
Just don't therapize
the Byrneses
this weekend at all, okay?

1371
00:49:06,810 --> 00:49:08,072
All l'm saying is,

1372
00:49:08,145 --> 00:49:09,669
a few minutes
of concentrated work

1373
00:49:09,746 --> 00:49:10,804
with him and Dina,

1374
00:49:10,881 --> 00:49:12,712
she could get him
to blow like Krakatoa.

1375
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:14,842
Right, okay, yeah,
you know what?

1376
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:17,185
One day, just give me
one day, okay,

1377
00:49:17,254 --> 00:49:18,551
without any complications.

1378
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:20,522
We get through it,
everybody goes off,

1379
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:22,319
we go on with our lives.
Can we do that?

1380
00:49:22,392 --> 00:49:23,825
All right.
You got it, dude.

1381
00:49:23,894 --> 00:49:25,088
Thank you, okay.

1382
00:49:25,162 --> 00:49:27,687
Hon, put the hat
back on the door, okay?

1383
00:49:27,764 --> 00:49:30,232
No mom.
No cowboy hat this weekend.

1384
00:49:30,334 --> 00:49:32,234
(Bernie)
Okay, but tonight
doesn't count.

1385
00:49:32,369 --> 00:49:33,597
[Bernie hooting]

1386
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:34,864
All aboard.

1387
00:49:35,005 --> 00:49:35,994
[Bernie laughing]

1388
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:47,883
Morning, partner.

1389
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:51,309
Morning.

1390
00:49:52,456 --> 00:49:53,582
Sleep okay?

1391
00:49:54,424 --> 00:49:56,324
l slept all right,
thank you.

1392
00:50:02,733 --> 00:50:04,462
lt's nice, all of us
being here together,

1393
00:50:04,534 --> 00:50:05,865
don't you think?

1394
00:50:07,037 --> 00:50:09,562
Bernard, do you mind
if l have some privacy?

1395
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:11,200
Almost done.

1396
00:50:19,483 --> 00:50:21,110
Bernie,
this fritatta is wonderful.

1397
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:22,173
What's in it?

1398
00:50:22,252 --> 00:50:24,447
Well, a lot of the taste comes
from this old skillet.

1399
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:25,613
l've never washed it.

1400
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:27,122
Hey, guys,

1401
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:29,349
can l have everybody's
attention, please?

1402
00:50:29,426 --> 00:50:31,394
Gay, be back in a second.

1403
00:50:31,895 --> 00:50:33,920
Okay, Dad. All right.

1404
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:35,658
Uh, so...

1405
00:50:36,166 --> 00:50:38,327
Mom, l know we've been--
we've been talking about

1406
00:50:38,402 --> 00:50:40,666
having the, uh,
wedding in October,

1407
00:50:40,737 --> 00:50:42,728
but Pam and l
have been doing
a little thinkin'

1408
00:50:42,806 --> 00:50:44,171
and playing around
with some ideas

1409
00:50:44,241 --> 00:50:46,300
and, uh, we're thinking
of moving it up to June.

1410
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:47,400
Nice.

1411
00:50:47,477 --> 00:50:48,466
This June?

1412
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:49,842
Yeah.
Yeah.

1413
00:50:49,913 --> 00:50:52,108
That's--that's in a month.

1414
00:50:52,282 --> 00:50:54,113
l always wanted
a spring wedding, you know.

1415
00:50:54,184 --> 00:50:56,675
Well, that's great,
so we can announce it
at the party tonight.

1416
00:50:56,753 --> 00:50:57,742
Good idea.

1417
00:50:57,821 --> 00:50:58,845
Wait, what party?

1418
00:50:58,922 --> 00:50:59,911
Jack!

1419
00:51:00,424 --> 00:51:01,584
Let's play football!

1420
00:51:01,658 --> 00:51:03,057
Oh, your father
and l are throwing

1421
00:51:03,126 --> 00:51:04,559
a little
engagement soiree

1422
00:51:04,628 --> 00:51:06,220
for you two lovebirds.

1423
00:51:06,296 --> 00:51:08,161
Look at that.

1424
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:10,927
(Pam)
That's so sweet.
Thank you, guys.

1425
00:51:11,001 --> 00:51:13,299
l thought we were just having
a nice quiet dinner.

1426
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:15,167
lt was supposed
to be a surprise.

1427
00:51:15,238 --> 00:51:17,536
The phone keeps ringing,
the list keeps growing.

1428
00:51:17,607 --> 00:51:19,632
Yeah, now,
it's up to 50 Fockers.

1429
00:51:19,709 --> 00:51:22,143
When were you going to tell us
about this?

1430
00:51:22,212 --> 00:51:25,443
50 Fockers.
What could be better?

1431
00:51:26,149 --> 00:51:28,242
Dad, what are you doing?
We never play football.

1432
00:51:28,318 --> 00:51:30,252
l'm trying to cement
relationships here.

1433
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:32,185
Jack said
he was into footy ball.

1434
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:34,723
Let's show El Stiffo
how we play the game.

1435
00:51:34,791 --> 00:51:35,780
Footy ball?

1436
00:51:35,859 --> 00:51:37,292
Come on, come on,
let's play!

1437
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:38,588
l'm feeling a little tired.

1438
00:51:38,662 --> 00:51:40,687
l think l'll sit it out
with Little Jack, okay?

1439
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:42,391
Honey, you want me to
keep you company?

1440
00:51:42,466 --> 00:51:43,956
No, Dina, come on,

1441
00:51:44,034 --> 00:51:45,865
you and l will take on
Jack and Roz.

1442
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:48,905
Come on, Jack, it'll be fun,
we'll swap wives.

1443
00:51:48,972 --> 00:51:51,805
Don't worry, you'll get her
back after the game.

1444
00:51:51,875 --> 00:51:52,864
[all laughing]

1445
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:54,171
Fine, we'll play
three on two.

1446
00:51:54,244 --> 00:51:56,144
But someone needs to be
official quarterback.

1447
00:51:56,213 --> 00:51:57,237
Gay goes both ways.

1448
00:51:57,314 --> 00:51:58,576
l'll bet he does.

1449
00:51:59,249 --> 00:52:00,238
[cooing]

1450
00:52:00,851 --> 00:52:03,115
One, two. Hut.

1451
00:52:06,756 --> 00:52:08,246
[all chattering]

1452
00:52:24,274 --> 00:52:25,298
Come on.

1453
00:52:25,375 --> 00:52:27,969
l'll run a down-and-in,
draw in the defense,

1454
00:52:28,044 --> 00:52:30,638
then you'll hit Roz
here in the end zone for a TD.

1455
00:52:30,714 --> 00:52:32,807
What do you mean?
He hits me where with a what?

1456
00:52:32,883 --> 00:52:35,113
l'll throw you the ball,
you try to catch it, okay.

1457
00:52:35,185 --> 00:52:37,119
You want me to catch?
Yeah.

1458
00:52:37,187 --> 00:52:38,176
On two. Ready?

1459
00:52:38,255 --> 00:52:39,347
Yes.

1460
00:52:39,422 --> 00:52:41,356
Hut one, hut two, hike!

1461
00:52:41,591 --> 00:52:42,580
[screams]

1462
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:45,084
Come on, this way!

1463
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:46,561
That way, that way,
that way.

1464
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:50,655
[Roz screams]

1465
00:52:50,734 --> 00:52:51,723
[laughs]

1466
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:54,330
You remember
that time in the park?

1467
00:52:54,404 --> 00:52:55,996
You remember that time
in the park?

1468
00:52:56,072 --> 00:52:57,869
Guys, come on, come on,
cut it out.

1469
00:52:58,108 --> 00:52:59,200
l'm so proud of you.

1470
00:52:59,376 --> 00:53:00,468
l caught the ball.

1471
00:53:00,544 --> 00:53:02,307
(Greg)
Mom, come on.

1472
00:53:02,379 --> 00:53:03,539
l caught the ball!

1473
00:53:03,613 --> 00:53:04,705
Come on, huddle up.

1474
00:53:04,781 --> 00:53:06,942
No, l'm bored. Here!

1475
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:08,416
Dina, come on, let's go.

1476
00:53:08,485 --> 00:53:09,543
You want a spritzer?

1477
00:53:09,619 --> 00:53:11,382
What? Oh, a spritzer.

1478
00:53:11,454 --> 00:53:12,443
That sounds yummy.

1479
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:14,513
All right, come on.
Dad, you got
to focus, all right?

1480
00:53:14,591 --> 00:53:16,422
He's beating you
down the field every time.

1481
00:53:16,493 --> 00:53:17,858
You want me to
be macho-wacho?

1482
00:53:17,928 --> 00:53:20,795
No. What? Have l ever said
the words macho-wacho
to you in my life?

1483
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:22,161
l got it.
What?

1484
00:53:22,232 --> 00:53:23,631
l won't disappoint you.

1485
00:53:24,568 --> 00:53:26,934
Okay, let's try again,
l'm gonna run a stop and go.

1486
00:53:27,003 --> 00:53:28,527
Fake the short pass,
then hit me here

1487
00:53:28,605 --> 00:53:29,970
in the end zone
with a Hail Mary.

1488
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,029
Okay, got that.

1489
00:53:31,107 --> 00:53:32,438
Yeah, we keep
running that play.

1490
00:53:32,509 --> 00:53:33,874
You want to mix
it up a little?

1491
00:53:33,944 --> 00:53:36,071
No, l don't. l've exposed
Bernie's weakness

1492
00:53:36,146 --> 00:53:37,613
and l want to take advantage
of it.

1493
00:53:37,681 --> 00:53:40,616
Exposed his weakness.
Okay, okay. On four?

1494
00:53:40,684 --> 00:53:41,673
Four.

1495
00:53:53,296 --> 00:53:55,924
Just you and me, Jack.
Mano a mano.

1496
00:53:56,866 --> 00:53:58,993
You think you can take me,
Flowerman?

1497
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:01,435
l'm pretty sure l can,
Mr. Mom.

1498
00:54:02,339 --> 00:54:04,204
You're going down,
Bernsie-boy.

1499
00:54:04,274 --> 00:54:06,105
l'm going to
rearrange your bouquet.

1500
00:54:08,645 --> 00:54:09,976
Sell the pump fake, Greg,

1501
00:54:10,046 --> 00:54:11,980
'cause that
Focker's gonna bite.

1502
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:20,287
[inaudible]

1503
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:22,391
[inaudible]

1504
00:54:22,959 --> 00:54:27,919
Hut one, hut two,
hut three, hut four. Hike!

1505
00:54:53,757 --> 00:54:54,746
[grunting]

1506
00:54:54,858 --> 00:54:57,554
Oh, my God!
Are you all right?

1507
00:54:57,927 --> 00:54:59,087
[screaming]

1508
00:54:59,162 --> 00:55:00,151
Shit!

1509
00:55:00,730 --> 00:55:01,719
[chanting]

1510
00:55:03,733 --> 00:55:05,360
Hey, Jack, you okay?

1511
00:55:05,502 --> 00:55:07,333
l'm fine, Greg, thank you.

1512
00:55:07,404 --> 00:55:09,565
l see that kind of injury
all the time at the hospital.

1513
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:11,664
l wish you'd let me
give you a quick exam.

1514
00:55:11,741 --> 00:55:13,800
No, l'm, l'm fine.

1515
00:55:13,877 --> 00:55:16,812
l told you l'll have my doctor
look at it when l get home.

1516
00:55:17,681 --> 00:55:18,670
Okay.

1517
00:55:19,282 --> 00:55:22,740
You know, it's amazing
how your father anticipated
the pump fake like that.

1518
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:25,413
lt's almost like
he knew it was coming.

1519
00:55:26,222 --> 00:55:27,211
Hmm.

1520
00:55:27,424 --> 00:55:31,155
Well, he definitely takes
competition seriously.

1521
00:55:32,429 --> 00:55:34,659
How a man handles himself
on the football field

1522
00:55:34,731 --> 00:55:36,722
says a lot
about his character.

1523
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,365
Know what l mean?

1524
00:55:39,769 --> 00:55:40,895
Okay.

1525
00:55:44,941 --> 00:55:46,272
Hey.
Hey.

1526
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:48,436
We got him, didn't we,
dude, huh?

1527
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:50,103
Was he impressed?

1528
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:52,171
No, Dad, he wasn't.
That was a really hard shot.

1529
00:55:52,248 --> 00:55:53,806
You could've hurt him.

1530
00:55:53,883 --> 00:55:55,680
l just wanted it
to be a fun game

1531
00:55:55,752 --> 00:55:57,083
but you wanted to win,

1532
00:55:57,153 --> 00:55:58,984
so, you know,
you got me all steamed up.

1533
00:55:59,055 --> 00:56:00,886
No, l asked you to play
a little defense,

1534
00:56:00,957 --> 00:56:03,084
l didn't ask you to turn it
into a blood sport.

1535
00:56:03,159 --> 00:56:05,389
l play too easy.
l play too hard.

1536
00:56:05,462 --> 00:56:07,657
What are you really
asking me to do, Gaylord?

1537
00:56:07,731 --> 00:56:09,494
l'm not asking
anything of you, Dad.

1538
00:56:09,566 --> 00:56:11,557
Just--just go down there
and apologize to him, okay?

1539
00:56:11,634 --> 00:56:13,329
He thinks it
was a cheap shot.

1540
00:56:13,403 --> 00:56:15,303
Sure. Okay.
Whatever you say.

1541
00:56:15,638 --> 00:56:16,627
Okay.

1542
00:56:18,575 --> 00:56:19,872
l can't win with this kid.

1543
00:56:19,943 --> 00:56:21,240
Honey--
(Bernie)
l can't.

1544
00:56:21,311 --> 00:56:22,335
lt's okay.

1545
00:56:22,412 --> 00:56:23,902
Hi, baby.
Hey.

1546
00:56:24,314 --> 00:56:27,943
So, how far along is Pam?
Hmm?

1547
00:56:28,251 --> 00:56:29,309
What?

1548
00:56:29,386 --> 00:56:31,650
Come on, honey, l knew it
the minute l saw her.

1549
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:33,279
Her boobs are bigger.
She's hormonal.

1550
00:56:33,356 --> 00:56:35,324
No wine at dinner,
no football.

1551
00:56:36,259 --> 00:56:37,988
She just found out yesterday.

1552
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:39,688
[screams]

1553
00:56:39,863 --> 00:56:41,455
Honey.

1554
00:56:41,598 --> 00:56:43,566
My bubeleh's
going to have a baby!

1555
00:56:43,633 --> 00:56:45,100
My bubeleh's
going to be a father!

1556
00:56:45,168 --> 00:56:46,328
Oh, my God.

1557
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:48,371
Tell me, talk to me,
so this is so exciting.

1558
00:56:48,438 --> 00:56:49,427
[shushing]

1559
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:51,534
No.
You didn't tell Dad, did you?

1560
00:56:51,608 --> 00:56:53,041
No, not yet.
He's gonna plotz.

1561
00:56:53,109 --> 00:56:54,406
No, no, Mom,
you can't tell him.

1562
00:56:54,477 --> 00:56:56,377
Why not?
Because he
can't keep a secret.

1563
00:56:56,446 --> 00:56:57,435
You know that.

1564
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:58,638
You think Jack knows?

1565
00:56:58,715 --> 00:57:00,615
Are you kidding?
That guy's in such denial,

1566
00:57:00,683 --> 00:57:02,674
he still thinks his daughter
is still a virgin.

1567
00:57:02,752 --> 00:57:04,379
Yeah, l know,
he's very old-fashioned.

1568
00:57:04,454 --> 00:57:06,581
That's why Pam
can't tell him
till after the wedding.

1569
00:57:06,656 --> 00:57:08,647
That is ridiculous.
Mom, it isn't, believe me.

1570
00:57:08,725 --> 00:57:10,215
You don't know him like l do.
Fine.

1571
00:57:10,293 --> 00:57:11,783
My lips are sealed.

1572
00:57:11,861 --> 00:57:13,920
l am so excited
and thrilled for you.

1573

1574
00:57:15,665 --> 00:57:17,189
So happy for you two!

1575
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:19,568
Did you plan this?

1576
00:57:19,636 --> 00:57:21,331
Uh, no,
it just sort of happened.

1577
00:57:21,404 --> 00:57:22,530
How did it happen?

1578
00:57:22,672 --> 00:57:23,798
How?

1579
00:57:23,973 --> 00:57:26,203
lt just happened.
You know--you know
how it happens.

1580
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:28,073
l mean, l'm not going
into the details.

1581
00:57:28,144 --> 00:57:29,702
Honey, l love details.

1582
00:57:29,813 --> 00:57:31,940
Sorry.
[mumbling]
All right. Okay.

1583
00:57:32,749 --> 00:57:33,773
Well, you know, honey,

1584
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:35,909
many unplanned
pregnancies happen

1585
00:57:35,985 --> 00:57:39,318
because the man
is such a sexual dynamo

1586
00:57:39,589 --> 00:57:41,784
and the woman
craves his sperm

1587
00:57:41,858 --> 00:57:44,053
on an unconscious
but very powerful level.

1588
00:57:44,227 --> 00:57:46,252
Hmm-mmm. Mom,
l am truly not comfortable

1589
00:57:46,329 --> 00:57:47,887
having this
conversation with you.

1590
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:49,124
No?
No.

1591
00:57:49,199 --> 00:57:50,632
l've been saying it
since l was 1 1 .

1592
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:51,826
All right.

1593
00:57:51,901 --> 00:57:54,062

Love you, too.

1594
00:57:55,205 --> 00:57:56,467
Uh, Jack!

1595
00:57:56,539 --> 00:57:58,200
What say you and me
go into town?

1596
00:57:58,274 --> 00:57:59,901
l got a guy
who can fix your RV.

1597
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:02,410
l'm in far too much
physical agony, Bernie.

1598
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:03,537
Gee, l'm sorry,

1599
00:58:03,613 --> 00:58:05,308
but it'll be good
for you, you know, to,

1600
00:58:05,381 --> 00:58:06,939
you know,
to get out and about.

1601
00:58:07,016 --> 00:58:09,917
Yeah. Perfect. l can take
the girls shopping
in Coconut Grove.

1602
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:11,180
Little Jack is on

1603
00:58:11,254 --> 00:58:12,812
a very specific
napping schedule.

1604
00:58:12,889 --> 00:58:14,049
l better stay here.

1605
00:58:14,123 --> 00:58:16,785
No, go. Greg can watch him.

1606
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:18,052
Yeah, sure.

1607
00:58:18,127 --> 00:58:20,027
He has wonderful
parental instincts.

1608
00:58:20,096 --> 00:58:22,621
Dad,
Greg deals with little kids
in the ER all the time.

1609
00:58:22,699 --> 00:58:25,259
lt's true. They don't call me
Barry Poppins for nothing.

1610
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:26,825
[all laughing]

1611
00:58:26,903 --> 00:58:28,393
(Roz)
That's so cute.

1612
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:30,905
Why would someone call you
Barry Poppins?

1613
00:58:34,844 --> 00:58:36,106
They wouldn't.

1614
00:59:01,638 --> 00:59:04,368
Now, remember, Greg,
we're Ferberizing him.

1615
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:06,135
So unless it's an emergency,

1616
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:08,177
under no circumstances
should you pick him up

1617
00:59:08,244 --> 00:59:09,973
or coddle him in any way
when he cries.

1618
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:11,206
Hmm-mmm. Okay.

1619
00:59:11,281 --> 00:59:13,215
He's learning to self-soothe,

1620
00:59:13,283 --> 00:59:15,751
that means no television,
no unapproved toys,

1621
00:59:15,818 --> 00:59:16,876
and most of all,

1622
00:59:16,953 --> 00:59:18,284
no monkey business
of any kind.

1623
00:59:18,354 --> 00:59:19,616

Mmm-hmm.

1624
00:59:19,689 --> 00:59:20,849
No monkey business.
Okay.

1629
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:39,005
This is a great find.

1630
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:40,440
Oh, good,
and it's loose,

1631
00:59:40,510 --> 00:59:42,978

if you gain a few pounds.

1634
00:59:47,617 --> 00:59:49,016
You look a little flushed.

1635
00:59:49,085 --> 00:59:51,315
Oh, it's just the heat.
lt takes some getting used to.

1636
00:59:51,387 --> 00:59:53,116

1637
00:59:53,189 --> 00:59:54,315
Thank you, Roz.

1638
00:59:55,058 --> 00:59:56,525
Now, madame,

1639
00:59:56,593 --> 00:59:59,027

for the momma to wear.

1642

Jack's blood flowing.

1643
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,332
Jack would have a coronary.

1644
01:00:06,669 --> 01:00:07,863

1645
01:00:07,937 --> 01:00:10,405
Oh, Dina, talk to me.

1646
01:00:11,574 --> 01:00:13,633
What's really going on
with that man?

1647
01:00:13,710 --> 01:00:15,905
He seems very uptight.

1648
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:18,437
Jack's always been
a little wound up.

1649
01:00:18,514 --> 01:00:20,379
His job was very stressful.

1650
01:00:20,683 --> 01:00:22,548
Being a florist is stressful?

1651
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:24,519
There's more to it
than people think.

1652
01:00:24,587 --> 01:00:25,576

01:00:47,076 --> 01:00:48,475
Lots of couples our age

1664
01:00:48,544 --> 01:00:50,273

in their marriages.

1665

we weren't intimate.

1666

01:10:38,701 --> 01:10:41,636
Please, Daddy. He made
an honest mistake. Let it go.

Did he say what
l am thinking?

1911
01:10:54,717 --> 01:10:56,116

1912
01:10:57,353 --> 01:10:59,719
Little Jack,
what did you just say?

1913
01:11:00,122 --> 01:11:02,852
Asshole.

1914
01:11:05,728 --> 01:11:07,355
His first word?

lt just slipped
out of my mouth. l--

1917
01:11:15,471 --> 01:11:16,495
That's enough.

your problems

No, no, l mean with
my own family. Excuse us.

1922

what you're talking about.
No, why?

1931
01:11:44,833 --> 01:11:46,425

your fiance may have

1932
01:11:46,502 --> 01:11:49,198

that he is not
telling you about.

1933

He does not.

you accept that,

1942
01:12:04,086 --> 01:12:06,054
the better it's going
to be for all of us.

1943

is a yoga instructor, either.

1946
01:12:14,196 --> 01:12:17,063
Jack, you promised
that you'd behave yourself.

1947
01:12:17,132 --> 01:12:18,565
And what you said
to those people

1948
01:12:18,634 --> 01:12:19,828
was really hurtful.

1949
01:12:19,902 --> 01:12:22,530

and apologize.

How about Poppy?

You don't have
to have champagne, okay?

1961
01:12:47,129 --> 01:12:48,756
Why?
Jack's really angry.

1962

a little meshuggenah.

we get to be grandparents?

that you will not break

2095

01:25:21,649 --> 01:25:23,981

No, l haven't.

01:25:36,431 --> 01:25:37,420
Nothing.

2256
01:25:37,499 --> 01:25:39,433
Jack, l can see it
in the mirror. What is it?

2257
01:25:39,501 --> 01:25:40,866
You got something
in your hand.

2258

offer you a sedative.

2263
01:25:50,545 --> 01:25:51,739
You're joking, right?

2264
01:25:51,813 --> 01:25:52,973
No, l'm not.

<i>or I will run you over.</i>

2426
01:32:16,230 --> 01:32:17,527
l'm not moving, Jack.

2427
01:32:17,598 --> 01:32:19,395
There's a non-violent way
to handle this.

2428
01:32:19,467 --> 01:32:20,456
What's going on?

2429
01:32:20,535 --> 01:32:21,900
Well, your father
wants to leave,

2430
01:32:21,969 --> 01:32:23,561
and Bernie is staging
a sit-in.

2431
01:32:23,638 --> 01:32:24,764
Dad, come on, get up.

2432
01:32:24,839 --> 01:32:25,897
This is ridiculous.

2433
01:32:25,973 --> 01:32:27,668
You weren't around
in the '60s, man.

2434
01:32:27,742 --> 01:32:29,403
This is how
we got things done.

2435
01:32:29,477 --> 01:32:33,106
<i>(Jack)</i>
<i>Pam, Dina, we have to get</i>
<i>off this island. It's evil.</i>

2436
01:32:33,180 --> 01:32:35,205
Jack Byrnes, out of the RV.

2437
01:32:35,283 --> 01:32:37,251
You are acting
like such a jerk.

2438
01:32:42,290 --> 01:32:44,520
Yes, there you go.

2439
01:32:44,625 --> 01:32:46,183
Jacko!
Yes.

2440
01:32:46,327 --> 01:32:47,919
Man, we're gonna
have a grandchild.

2441
01:32:47,995 --> 01:32:49,553
Come on,
we should be celebrating.

2442
01:32:49,630 --> 01:32:51,154
How could you not see it?

2443
01:32:51,232 --> 01:32:53,564
Greg is completely unfit
to handle a child.

2444
01:32:53,634 --> 01:32:55,795
He's neglected his own son
for 15 years.

2445
01:32:55,870 --> 01:32:57,599
Hey, Jack, l didn't even know
he existed.

2446
01:32:57,672 --> 01:32:58,696
That's right.

2447
01:32:58,773 --> 01:33:00,240
Who knows what to believe
with you?

2448
01:33:00,308 --> 01:33:01,741
You're dishonest
about everything.

2449
01:33:01,809 --> 01:33:04,642
You're so much better, Jack?
Why don't you tell everybody

2450
01:33:04,712 --> 01:33:06,646
what you did last night
to Greg at the party.

2451
01:33:06,714 --> 01:33:07,772
Muskrat, Dina.

2452
01:33:07,848 --> 01:33:09,713
Oh, stuff
your muskrat, Jack.

2453
01:33:10,217 --> 01:33:13,414
He shot Greg with truth serum
before his speech.

2454
01:33:13,487 --> 01:33:14,579
What?

2455
01:33:14,655 --> 01:33:16,282
Yeah,
l found this in his pocket.

2456
01:33:16,357 --> 01:33:17,915
Here we go again, Dad.

2457
01:33:17,992 --> 01:33:20,893
He did the same thing
to Pam's junior prom date.

2458
01:33:20,962 --> 01:33:22,623
Wait a minute.
Yes, yes. Wait a minute.

2459
01:33:22,697 --> 01:33:23,925
You stuck a needle in my neck.

2460
01:33:23,998 --> 01:33:25,556
You drugged my son?

2461
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:28,462
l had no choice.
He refuses to tell the truth.

2462
01:33:28,536 --> 01:33:29,798
Because he's terrified,

2463
01:33:29,870 --> 01:33:31,394
and he thinks
he has to impress you.

2464
01:33:31,472 --> 01:33:33,030
He's had us
trying to impress you,

2465
01:33:33,107 --> 01:33:34,131
but in my opinion,

2466
01:33:34,208 --> 01:33:35,470
Jack, l think it's you

2467
01:33:35,543 --> 01:33:37,010
who should be
trying to impress us.

2468
01:33:37,078 --> 01:33:38,477
Jack.

2469
01:33:38,546 --> 01:33:40,707
You've insulted me,
my wife, my son,

2470
01:33:40,781 --> 01:33:42,271
our entire way of life.

2471
01:33:42,350 --> 01:33:44,409
l've sat back and taken it.
But now,

2472
01:33:44,485 --> 01:33:46,146
you've crossed the line, sir.

2473
01:33:46,220 --> 01:33:48,313
And l'm gonna have
to kick your ass.

2474
01:33:48,389 --> 01:33:49,947
Dad, dad, wait a second.

2475
01:33:50,024 --> 01:33:53,152
l'm gonna teach this florist
some justice, Focker-style.

2476
01:33:53,227 --> 01:33:54,489
Just calm down.

2477
01:33:54,562 --> 01:33:55,927
Just give me
a minute to stretch.

2478
01:33:55,997 --> 01:33:57,726
(Roz)
Bernie,
you're gonna hurt yourself.

2479
01:33:57,798 --> 01:33:59,595
We can talk this through.

2480
01:33:59,667 --> 01:34:01,066
lt's too late for words,
Rosalind.

2481
01:34:01,135 --> 01:34:02,397
Dad, Dad, no, no,

2482
01:34:02,470 --> 01:34:03,869
please,
no dance fighting. Stop!

2483
01:34:03,938 --> 01:34:05,132
This is Capoeira, man.

2484
01:34:05,206 --> 01:34:06,332
This is hardcore shit.

2485
01:34:06,407 --> 01:34:08,307
Bernard, if you continue,

2486
01:34:08,409 --> 01:34:09,933
you will force
me to engage you.

2487
01:34:10,011 --> 01:34:11,842
And once l begin
the sequence of combat,

2488
01:34:11,912 --> 01:34:13,607
it can only end
with your demise.

2489
01:34:13,681 --> 01:34:16,275
Bring it, dog. Come on.
Bring it. Come on.

2490
01:34:16,350 --> 01:34:17,408
He's taunting me.

2491
01:34:17,485 --> 01:34:18,611
Dad.

2492
01:34:18,686 --> 01:34:19,675
(Pam)
Greg!
Greg!

2493
01:34:19,754 --> 01:34:21,585
What, Bernie,
you're gonna snap now?

2494
01:34:22,189 --> 01:34:23,281
(Pam)
Greg!

2495
01:34:23,357 --> 01:34:24,289
What?

2496
01:34:25,793 --> 01:34:27,522
Now look what you did.

2497
01:34:27,595 --> 01:34:29,062
lt's your fault.

2498
01:34:29,130 --> 01:34:30,620
He's bleeding.
He's bleeding, Daddy.

2499
01:34:30,698 --> 01:34:32,325
That's it. Pam, Dina,

2500
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:33,765
l'm calling
a family conference.

2501
01:34:33,834 --> 01:34:34,926
Come on.

2502
01:34:35,002 --> 01:34:36,162
No, Dad, this is the family.

2503
01:34:36,237 --> 01:34:38,603
All right? ln a few weeks,
l'm not gonna be Pam Byrnes.

2504
01:34:38,673 --> 01:34:40,038
l'm gonna be Pamela Focker.

2505
01:34:40,107 --> 01:34:41,369
Or Byrnes-Focker.

2506
01:34:41,442 --> 01:34:42,670
We haven't
totally decided yet.

2507
01:34:42,743 --> 01:34:44,938
No, no, no, l'm gonna be
Pamela Martha Focker.

2508
01:34:45,012 --> 01:34:46,502
l know how that sounds,

2509
01:34:46,580 --> 01:34:48,070
but--but that's
the name l'm taking.

2510
01:34:48,149 --> 01:34:49,980
Pamcake, you're upset.
l'm not so sure

2511
01:34:50,051 --> 01:34:51,678
you're thinking
clearly right now.

2512
01:34:51,752 --> 01:34:52,741
l'm trying, Dad.

2513
01:34:52,820 --> 01:34:54,378
lt's you who
is not thinking clearly.

2514
01:34:54,455 --> 01:34:56,446
These two kids
love each other. Look.

2515
01:34:56,524 --> 01:34:59,755
We've been kvelling about
this pregnancy all weekend.

2516
01:35:00,094 --> 01:35:01,823
You knew she was pregnant?

2517
01:35:02,096 --> 01:35:03,859
We all did, Jack.

2518
01:35:05,700 --> 01:35:08,760
Daddy, l was gonna tell you
after the wedding, l swear.

2519
01:35:10,938 --> 01:35:13,270
This is the reason l created
the circle of trust

2520
01:35:13,340 --> 01:35:15,672
so we could
discuss these things.

2521
01:35:16,043 --> 01:35:17,510
The circle isn't gonna work

2522
01:35:17,578 --> 01:35:20,138
if you don't trust
anyone that's in it, Dad.

2523
01:35:26,854 --> 01:35:27,912
(Pam)
Dad.

2524
01:35:27,988 --> 01:35:29,046
Jack, don't.

2525
01:35:29,123 --> 01:35:31,353
No, Dad.
Daddy.

2526
01:35:31,425 --> 01:35:32,414
(Dina)
Honey.

2527
01:35:32,727 --> 01:35:34,524
Daddy, please.
Daddy, where are you going?

2528
01:35:34,595 --> 01:35:36,153
Jack. Come on.

2529
01:35:36,630 --> 01:35:37,995
[engine starting]

2530
01:35:38,599 --> 01:35:40,089
[all chattering]

2531
01:35:41,202 --> 01:35:43,636
Daddy, come back, please.

2532
01:35:48,442 --> 01:35:49,602
[sighs]

2533
01:35:49,677 --> 01:35:52,043
This is <i>nicht gut.</i>

2534
01:35:57,518 --> 01:35:59,247
[car phone ringing]

2535
01:36:07,828 --> 01:36:08,886
(Roz)
ls it ringing?

2536
01:36:08,963 --> 01:36:10,021
There's no answer.

2537
01:36:10,097 --> 01:36:11,689
Well, let's give him
some space.

2538
01:36:11,766 --> 01:36:13,290
Maybe he's learning
to self-soothe.

2539
01:36:13,367 --> 01:36:14,664
Roz.
What?

2540
01:36:14,735 --> 01:36:16,430
This is crazy. l'm going.

2541
01:36:16,504 --> 01:36:17,596
l'm coming with you, Son.

2542
01:36:17,671 --> 01:36:18,797
No, Dad, l can do it myself.

2543
01:36:18,873 --> 01:36:20,670
We gotta make up time.
l know these roads

2544
01:36:20,741 --> 01:36:22,606
like the back
of my hand.

2545
01:36:23,911 --> 01:36:26,539
Come on, let's put
this family back together.

2546
01:36:27,414 --> 01:36:29,575
(Greg)
Dad, l know a shortcut.

2547
01:36:29,650 --> 01:36:31,777
lt will lead us
to the freeway.

2548
01:36:32,787 --> 01:36:35,984
(Bernie)
l think you make
a right up here or a left.

2549
01:36:36,056 --> 01:36:37,887
lt's either one or the other.

2550
01:36:37,958 --> 01:36:39,482
You don't know
where we are, do you?

2551
01:36:39,560 --> 01:36:40,891
You know,
something's wrong here.

2552
01:36:40,961 --> 01:36:42,258
This makes no sense at all.

2553
01:36:42,329 --> 01:36:44,126
Dad, it's a map of Detroit.

2554
01:36:44,198 --> 01:36:45,859
Oh, well, that explains it.

2555
01:36:45,933 --> 01:36:47,059
Dad.

2556
01:36:47,134 --> 01:36:48,226
(Bernie)
Punch it, Gay.

2557
01:36:48,302 --> 01:36:49,428
We gotta catch that dude.

2558
01:36:50,237 --> 01:36:51,932
[siren wailing]

2559
01:36:53,374 --> 01:36:54,432
Oh, shit.

2560
01:36:54,508 --> 01:36:55,941
Come on.
Come on. Keep going.

2561
01:36:56,010 --> 01:36:58,308
Dad, come on, it's a cop.

2562
01:36:58,379 --> 01:37:00,643
Listen carefully.
Let me do the talking.

2563
01:37:00,714 --> 01:37:02,511
l know how to handle
the local cops.

2564
01:37:02,583 --> 01:37:03,880
No, don't--don't
do any talking.

2565
01:37:03,951 --> 01:37:05,077
Don't shush me,
l'm a lawyer.

2566
01:37:05,152 --> 01:37:06,141
l'm not shushing you.

2567
01:37:06,220 --> 01:37:08,381
You know how many tickets
l've talked myself out of?

2568
01:37:08,455 --> 01:37:09,922
Oh, wow.
Will you look at this guy.

2569
01:37:09,990 --> 01:37:11,480
Don't they have
height requirements?

2570
01:37:11,559 --> 01:37:13,026
(Greg)
We're screwed.
No, we're not.

2571
01:37:13,093 --> 01:37:15,391
Don't. don't, Dad, he said
to remain in the vehicle.

2572
01:37:16,831 --> 01:37:20,028
Sir, l said to remain
in your vehicle.

2573
01:37:20,100 --> 01:37:22,125
l just wanna talk to you
for one second.

2574
01:37:22,203 --> 01:37:24,364
Let's just talk
like friendly Floridians.

2575
01:37:24,438 --> 01:37:26,167
lf you fail to comply,
l will arrest you.

2576
01:37:26,240 --> 01:37:27,867
You see, my son's future
father-in-law

2577
01:37:27,942 --> 01:37:29,773
thinks my Gay back there
has a bastard son.

2578
01:37:29,844 --> 01:37:30,868
l said shut it.

2579
01:37:30,945 --> 01:37:31,969
Shut it.

2580
01:37:32,046 --> 01:37:33,638
l know my civil rights now.

2581
01:37:33,714 --> 01:37:35,341
You know your rights? Huh?

2582
01:37:35,416 --> 01:37:36,508
Oh!

2583
01:37:36,584 --> 01:37:37,915
(Bernie)
l have sensitive wrists.

2584
01:37:37,985 --> 01:37:39,009
Excuse me.

2585
01:37:39,086 --> 01:37:40,610
Sir, return to your vehicle.

2586
01:37:40,688 --> 01:37:42,121
l don't know
what he said, but--

2587
01:37:42,189 --> 01:37:43,588
That's it.
On your belly.

2588
01:37:43,657 --> 01:37:44,715
On my belly?

2589
01:37:44,792 --> 01:37:45,816
You got a hearing problem?

2590
01:37:45,893 --> 01:37:47,019
No, l'm just trying to say--

2591
01:37:47,094 --> 01:37:49,824
Now we have two failures
to comply.

2592
01:37:50,231 --> 01:37:52,756
Now, l need the two of you

2593
01:37:52,833 --> 01:37:56,166
to remain on the vehicle.

2594
01:37:59,306 --> 01:38:01,831
Okay, now here's my plan.

2595
01:38:01,909 --> 01:38:02,967
Plan?

[laughing]

2939
01:52:57,070 --> 01:52:59,265
<i>Hey, look at me,</i>
<i>Jack, what am I?</i>

2940
01:52:59,339 --> 01:53:00,829
<i>[grunting]</i>

2941
01:53:03,343 --> 01:53:05,277
<i>I am a frozen caveman.</i>

2942
01:53:05,345 --> 01:53:07,142
<i>Study me, Jack.</i>

2943
01:53:07,213 --> 01:53:10,705
<i>Learn how strange</i>
<i>the Focker genetic code is.</i>

2944
01:53:10,784 --> 01:53:13,082
<i>We are weird mutants</i>
<i>who hug and kiss.</i>

2945
01:53:13,153 --> 01:53:15,417
<i>We show emotion.</i>

2946
01:53:15,722 --> 01:53:17,189
<i>Jack must learn from us</i>

2947
01:53:17,257 --> 01:53:18,884
<i>and chip away</i>
<i>with his hammer of truth.</i>

2948
01:53:18,958 --> 01:53:20,391
Ha, Focker.

2949
01:53:20,727 --> 01:53:22,058
<i>Wooga booga.</i>
