1
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:03,034
Stuart, are you down there?

2
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,679
Yeah, Mom, I'm here.

3
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,954
Thank goodness.
You had me worried.

4
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,680
It's okay.
He's down in the basement.

5
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,671
-Have you finished packing?
-Yeah, Mom.

6
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,355
-Did you remember clean underpants?
-Yes.

7
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,397
-Well, we're leaving in--
-Five minutes.

8
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,198
I'll be right there.

9
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,149
Yes!

10
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,151
Hey, Mr. Big Game Hunter...

11
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,834
...better take those batteries out
before you cook him.

12
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,150
Hey, Snowbell.
You all ready for our vacation?

13
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:36,517
You call spending the summer
in a cabin in the woods a vacation?

14
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,591
I call it cruel and unusual
punishment.

15
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,797
Oh, come on.
Don't you hear the call of the wild?

16
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:45,316
Learning to live off the land,
exploring the woods.

17
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,153
Sleeping in the dirt,
no air conditioning, Lyme disease.

18
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,392
I hate to burst your bubble,
Daniel Boob, but it's dangerous there.

19
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,312
The closest you've been
to the woods...

20
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,710
...is the occasional whiff
of pine air freshener.

21
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:59,475
You sound just like Mom and Dad.
But I have instinctive, natural abilities.

22
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,438
I mean, after all,
I am somewhat like a mouse.

23
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,750
You're also somewhat
like a mental case.

24
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,036
This summer is gonna be
a real turning point.

25
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,599
I'm gonna prove to Mom and Dad...

26
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,751
...I don't need them
watching my every step.

27
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,399
I can take care of myself.

28
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,596
-I don't need to be told what to do.
-Stuart.

29
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,957
-It's a long drive. Did you go potty?
-Mom!

30
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,838
The whole neighbourhood
will hear you.

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,039
I'm sure Davy Crockett's mother
asked him the very same question.

32
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,594
-Monty.
-Oh, man.

33
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,796
-I didn't believe it.
-Believe what?

34
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:32,590
Well, word in the alley is
you are going camping.

35
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,990
-Camping?
-Now you're gonna have to rough it...

36
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,596
...just like the rest of us,
Mr. Fancy Pants.

37
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,637
That's malicious slander.

38
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,113
-Well, then where are you going?
-Where? Well, to....

39
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,795
Where? Yes, we're going--
Oh, we're going to a fancy resort.

40
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:53,430
It's the Hartz Mountain
Resort and Spa.

41
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,192
Sounds nice.

42
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,873
It's paradise.

43
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,076
All-you-can-eat kibble buffet...

44
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:03,392
...whisker waxing,
pawdicure, tail grooming...

45
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,950
...24-hour Animal Planet.

46
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,112
Hey, can I come?

47
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,872
Can you co--? Yeah, well....

48
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,712
-I don't know.
-Oh, come on, can I come? Please?

49
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:19,475
Hey, it's not me, it's the Littles.

50
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:24,077
They don't exactly....
Oh, what am I trying to say here?

51
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,118
They don't like you.

52
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,510
Well, I guess I know
when I'm not wanted.

53
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,511
Actually, you don't.
But you're learning.

54
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,911
And I'll think of you
when I'm eating caviar for breakfast.

55
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,638
And I'll think of you when I'm--

56
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:40,753
-Like taking sardines from a kitten.
-Time to go, Snow.

57
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,511
Given a choice,
I'd rather be at the vet.

58
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,274
Come on, come on. Yes!

59
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,238
-Yes, yes, no, no.
-We're on our way.

60
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,678
We should be at the lake
in two hours, 34 minutes.

61
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,513
Well, I'm forgetting
about time altogether.

62
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,240
I have nothing
on my calendar all summer...

63
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,516
...but lazy days and carefree nights.

64
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,796
Hey, Mom, Dad?

65
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,712
I'm doing research
about Lake Garland.

66
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,791
There's a group there
called the Lake Scouts.

67
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,349
-That's good, son.
-I wanna join.

68
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,909
-That's not so good.
-But it's totally cool.

69
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,992
They go rock climbing,
boating, exploring.

70
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,071
-My, that sounds--
-Dangerous.

71
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,391
Oh, Mom, I'm not a baby.
I can handle it.

72
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,677
I don't know, Stuart.
Something could happen to you.

73
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:38,719
But I want something
to happen to me.

74
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,314
Stuart, sweetie, I have to put
my foot down and say--

75
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,595
Yes!

76
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:46,389
It might do him some good.
I mean, I myself was a Lake Scout.

77
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,278
And a pretty darn good one too.

78
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,908
But he's too small.
Who will take care of him?

79
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,469
-Well, I will.
-Yeah.

80
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,119
-You mean...?
-What if I were there?

81
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,352
-Watching him every step of the way.
-Wait. That's not quite what--

82
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,829
-Every step?
-Every step.

83
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,956
-And George can join too.
-No way.

84
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,953
I've got to get to level 38
by the end of the summer.

85
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:10,352
Now, George, it'll be a bonding
experience for us Little men.

86
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,597
Just testing your reflexes, dear.
And you passed.

87
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,468
-You'll watch him every minute?
-Every minute.

88
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,675
Yippee!

89
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,673
-But there are rules.
-What kind of rules?

90
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,276
Never wander off by yourself.
Never wander off with someone else.

91
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,237
No wandering, period.

92
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,198
Don't sit too close to the fire.
You'll burn yourself.

93
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,591
Don't sit too far away from the fire.
You'll catch a cold.

94
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,352
Insect repellent is a must.

95
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,479
Remember, mosquito's bite
is bacteria's delight.

96
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,639
I don't know why it has to be
The sky is blue and the grass is green

97
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,032
And I don't know why it's really true
That one plus one always equals two

98
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,191
I don't know so I have to guess

99
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,237
There may be times
When a no means yes

100
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,391
And maybe, just maybe

101
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,915
It doesn't really matter

102
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,071
Hey now look around

103
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,435
Does anybody know
What's going down

104
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,912
Hey now it's okay
The world keeps spinning anyway

105
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:15,551
Hey now why ask why
Low is low and high is high

106
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:20,999
Hey now just let go
It's all right if you really don't know

107
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:30,273
Yeah, and I really don't know

108
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,070
-It's going to need some sprucing up.
-I've seen cleaner litter boxes.

109
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,317
There goes my summer
with nothing to do.

110
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,153
Well, it is called "roughing it."

111
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:43,551
-A little too rough, if you ask me.
-You're a pioneer now, Snowbell.

112
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,473
-Get with the program.
-I don't like this program.

113
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,119
Where's the remote?

114
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,718
Nothing like the great outdoors, huh?

115
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,996
The great outdoors
should stay outdoors.

116
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:00,835
That's why they invented doors:
to keep the outdoors out.

117
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,798
Can't wait to become
a Lake Scout, huh, George?

118
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,713
Stuart, what's the cheat code
for infinite health?

119
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,871
A-B-B-X-Y.

120
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,476
Just in time. Thanks.

121
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,915
Come on, George,
get your head out of the game.

122
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,833
Look around you.
I mean, you want adventure?

123
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,912
You never know what you'll find
out here in the woods.

124
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,038
Well, hello, Diggity!

125
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,555
What have we here?

126
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,678
I mean, wouldn't you rather...?

127
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,508
Little help?

128
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,910
Wouldn't you rather feel
the wind in your face...

129
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,196
...than just sit here
punching buttons all day?

130
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,952
No, too many bugs.

131
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,951
What about all the stuff
we could learn?

132
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,190
How to protect yourself
against wild animals.

133
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,999
Or how to find your way home
if you get lost in the woods.

134
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,038
You can't get lost in the woods
if you never go into the woods.

135
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,475
Boy, you've got an answer
for everything.

136
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,993
-Yep.
-Look at it this way:

137
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:54,596
Scouting will teach you
how to stand on your own two feet.

138
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,912
-Gesundheit.
-Gesundheit.

139
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,477
How to take care of yourself.
How to be a man.

140
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:05,794
You know, Stuart, I'm just not into
this outdoorsy stuff like you are.

141
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:11,315
I mean, what will I get
out of the Lake Scouts?

142
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,233
Hi. I'm Brooke.

143
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,999
-Hi.
-Hello.

144
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,390
I'm Stuart, and this is
my brother, George.

145
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,278
You guys gonna join
the Lake Scouts?

146
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,238
I am, but I don't think
George wants to.

147
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,073
He's trying to get to level 38
on Cyberdon Rex.

148
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,915
Good luck without
the unlimited ammo code.

149
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,231
-Unlimited?
-X-X-Y-A-B-A-B-X.

150
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,994
Totally cool.

151
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:52,353
So when's that Lake Scout signup?
Tomorrow?

152
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,670
-ls that a cat?
-Nothing gets by this one.

153
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,159
Better be careful with him.

154
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,958
-Why's that?
-The Beast.

155
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:02,079
-The Beast?
-Yeah, the Beast.

156
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,277
They say it can hear you
from the other side of the forest.

157
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,798
And when it drinks from the lake,
the water drops a foot.

158
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:14,909
They say it can smell
a drop of blood five miles away.

159
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,795
So you better keep
your animals inside...

160
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:22,272
...because I hear
its favourite food is cats.

161
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,797
See you around, Stuart. George.

162
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,076
Boy, she's a piece of work.

163
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,515
She sure is.

164
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:36,753
Does she really expect us to believe
some crazy story about a beast?

165
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,036
I'll tell you one thing,
if there is a beast...

166
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,316
...it wouldn't stand a chance
if I ran into it.

167
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,519
-I'd kick him. I'd tie it in a--
-Let me know how that works out.

168
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,875
-Snowbell, where are you going?
-To hide.

169
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:51,476
Before that Beast gets a whiff
of USDA Prime Snowbell.

170
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:00,355
Things weren't bad enough.
Now I have to worry about being eaten?

171
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,711
Is there someone there?

172
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,716
The Beast!

173
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:27,080
All right. Take me, you monster.

174
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,353
-Monty?
-You should've seen your face, pal.

175
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:34,751
-lt was priceless.
-Glad to be a source of amusement.

176
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:38,230
-What are you doing here?
-I stowed away in the trunk.

177
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,233
So this is the fancy resort?

178
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,709
Resort? Right.

179
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,229
Well, it looked much better
in the brochure.

180
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,956
-I can't believe you lied to me.
-I didn't lie.

181
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:54,477
I merely distorted the truth to fit
the paradoxical reality of the situation.

182
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,073
At least you weren't lying.

183
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,549
Well, I'm glad you came,
but now you have to leave.

184
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,676
Leave? All the way
back to New York?

185
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:04,355
-How am I supposed to get there?
-There's a new thing called "walking."

186
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:07,751
Oh, man. I don't even know
why we're friends.

187
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,433
All we ever do is fight.

188
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,716
Oh, no, I don't fight.
It's beneath me.

189
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,348
You, you're the fighter. But--

190
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:17,318
Wait a minute. You're the fighter.

191
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:20,552
Yeah, well, living on the streets,
you gotta be a fighter.

192
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,349
Rats and crows, street sweepers....

193
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:27,557
Hey, you know what, old buddy?
I changed my mind.

194
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,315
-Really? All right.
-Mi cabin es su cabin.

195
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,948
You can stay right here
under the porch...

196
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,156
...and keep an eye on things for me.

197
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,117
-What kind of things?
-You know.

198
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:42,068
Things that look odd,
or scary, or beastly.

199
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,071
Especially anything beastly.

200
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,117
I can't emphasize that enough.

201
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:49,750
And I will make sure
your stay with us is comfortable.

202
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,153
When you get hungry,
just tap on this pipe here...

203
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,594
...and I'll bring you food.

204
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,796
-Cool.
-Monty, I'm counting on you.

205
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,837
You'll be my first line of defence.

206
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,470
Hey, what do you mean,
"first line of defence"?

207
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:05,071
No, no. I said,
"Stay inside the fence."

208
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,190
"The fence." Right.

209
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,396
Right. But there isn't any fence.

210
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,312
I was speaking metaphorically.

211
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,113
I didn't know you spoke
another language.

212
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:29,154
-Goodnight, baby.
-Mom, I'm not a baby.

213
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,392
George.

214
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,832
What?

215
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,070
Okay.

216
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,552
Look at them sleeping.

217
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,869
They've got nothing to worry about.

218
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:55,999
I, on the other hand,
have to find a place to hide.

219
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,437
Cottontail, my fine,
fuzzy, flop-haired fellow.

220
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,831
How's the kids? All 50 of them?

221
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,874
Okay, okay.
I'll talk to you later. Cool.

222
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,111
Beavie! Beave, hey!

223
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:41,829
-Man, am I glad to see you.
-Don't even ask.

224
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,877
Come on, Beave.
I'll pay you back.

225
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,075
That'll be a first.

226
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,312
If I don't come through,
I am Beast chow.

227
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,799
Talk to the paw.

228
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,235
It's because I'm a skunk, isn't it?

229
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,153
I guess you'll be asking me
to stand downwind next.

230
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,992
I'd like to ask him now.

231
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:01,714
If you ask me, somebody
should teach that Beast a lesson.

232
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:05,793
Just once, just once, I'd like
to show that two-bit tyrant...

233
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:09,316
...the business end of my tail,
know what I'm saying?

234
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,679
Give him some of this.

235
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,878
Beast?

236
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,591
Hey, Beast,
I was just talking about you.

237
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,115
You are looking beautiful tonight.

238
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:26,716
There's another beast out there
going, "Where's my baby?"

239
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:33,919
Well, never let it be said
that Reeko comes empty-handed.

240
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,758
Fiber.

241
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:42,915
Okay, now, I know it doesn't look
like much, but believe me...

242
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:46,675
...there's a party inside this bark
and your taste buds are invited.

243
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,674
Or you could use it
as a fake moustache.

244
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,198
Oh, where did the Reeko go?
I'll go look for him.

245
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,838
You found me.

246
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:04,517
What do you say
I pay you double next full moon?

247
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:08,472
Okay? We're cool, right?

248
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,750
Yo, I am so sk--

249
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,673
Not good. Not good.

250
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,313
You never heard of closing the lid?

251
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:32,629
No swimming till four hours after
eating or three hours before eating.

252
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,509
-And no swimming while eating.
-Mom, I know the rules. I do.

253
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,954
I know. I'm sorry.

254
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:41,317
Just promise me you won't take
any unnecessary risks.

255
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,072
I promise.

256
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,512
Unnecessary?

257
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,836
-Let's go, George.
-Have fun, boys.

258
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,479
Don't worry about us, dear.

259
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:57,315
The Little men are completely
at home in the forest.

260
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,433
Yup.

261
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:12,316
-lsn't there someone in charge here?
-That would be me.

262
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,597
-Do you know anything about knots?
-ls that the troopmaster?

263
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,274
Yeah, but he hasn't
really mastered the troops yet.

264
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:22,115
Oswald, a compass
is not a weapon.

265
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:25,159
I'm Frederick Little,
and these are my sons.

266
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,673
-Stuart.
-Hi!

267
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,034
And George.

268
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,508
Oh, yeah.
I'm Bicklemaster Troop.

269
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:36,310
-I mean, Troopmaster Bickle.
-Hey, Dad.

270
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,392
-Are you gonna ask?
-Of course, Stuart.

271
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,790
My boys were wondering
if they could join up.

272
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,518
-Why, sure.
-Yes.

273
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,990
Yes. Per article 17
of the Lake Scout Handbook...

274
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,230
-...everyone is welcome.
-Yeah!

275
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,039
Great. And how about me?

276
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,953
Well, there's no rule against it...

277
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,918
...but don't you think
you're a little too big to be a scout?

278
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:02,755
Well, I had some sort
of assistant position in mind.

279
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,909
But really, do I look like
I need an assistant?

280
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,354
Sorry.

281
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,034
Okay, I admit it.
I'm in way over my head.

282
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:16,399
-Little, you've got the job.
-Great. How about a Scout shake?

283
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,233
No, I meant Scout handshake.

284
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,712
Okay, walk it, turn and up.

285
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,191
There you go.

286
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,559
Attention, scouts.

287
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,393
We'll start with
the skull assessment test.

288
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,994
I think that would be "skill."

289
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,310
Okay. Well, that's different then.

290
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,233
The exceptional scouts
will get to wear the gold kerchief.

291
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,436
The intermediates receive the blue.

292
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,353
And for those beginning
scouts who....

293
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,715
-Need extra help?
-Yeah.

294
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,270
The red shows up better
when they get lost.

295
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,794
Okay, you just need
to row your canoes...

296
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,633
...from the dock here,
over to the shore there.

297
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,751
This might be a problem.

298
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,514
I'm looking for how well
you control your craft.

299
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:16,639
Points will be taken off
for sinking and drowning.

300
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,070
Give this one a try, son.

301
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,912
Perfect.

302
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,833
Thanks, Dad.

303
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,959
Ready, set, go.

304
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:29,592
-Come on!
-You can do it!

305
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,758
What the heck was that?

306
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,112
Get out of here.

307
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,110
I'm being attacked by a shark!

308
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,558
Oh, no. Oh, dear, I'm going down.

309
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,752
Shark!

310
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,194
Oh, this is it.

311
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,074
Goodbye, Mom and Dad and George
and Snowbell and Martha--

312
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,832
What are you talking about, Stuart?

313
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:32,277
Yes! I made it. How was my time?

314
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,271
-Could have been better.
-Good try.

315
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,716
I would have made it.
But there was this giant fish.

316
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,552
It was a shark.

317
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,995
And it was pulling me
all around the lake.

318
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,149
Didn't you see it?

319
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,992
Maybe it was
the Loch Ness Monster.

320
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,752
-Or Bigfoot.
-Bigfoot doesn't swim.

321
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,309
-He likes to be called Sasquatch.
-Whatever.

322
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,357
Sasquatch doesn't swim either.

323
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:58,557
Tonight, around this Lake Scout
campfire of burning logs...

324
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,951
...we honour you by awarding
these kerchiefs.

325
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,672
-Elwin.
-Go, Elwin. Yeah.

326
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,717
-Brooke.
-Yeah, Brooke.

327
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:12,032
-George.
-Well done, son. Just like a Little.

328
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,712
-Stuart.
-Yeah?

329
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,030
Sorry there, Stuart.
You stay red.

330
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,839
-Red?
-Maybe next time.

331
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,592
Congratulations, scouts.

332
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,359
Tough day, huh, Stuart?

333
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,313
Yeah. Toughest one ever.

334
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:36,990
You know, son, not everyone gets
a gold kerchief their first summer.

335
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,276
-Did you?
-Well, Stuart....

336
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,953
Well, okay, I did.

337
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,112
But the point is that
you try your best.

338
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,952
And that's what we Littles do.

339
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:49,476
It's only the beginning of summer.
You'll have plenty more opportunities.

340
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,757
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna stay red for long.

341
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,353
Hey, Dad...

342
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,351
...I really love these talks.

343
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:02,069
-Nice shot.
-Aim. Aim.

344
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:07,230
I'm not afraid to fall
I've fallen many times

345
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:12,110
They laughed when I fell down
But I have dared to climb

346
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,748
Not afraid to fall

347
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,717
I know I'll fall again

348
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:21,192
But I will win this in the end

349
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:24,757
If I get up I might fall
Back down again

350
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,512
So let's get up
C'mon

351
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:29,513
If I get up I might
Fall back down again

352
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,432
But we get up anyway

353
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,353
If I get up I might fall
Back down again

354
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,828
C'mon

355
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,831
-Get up
-C'mon

356
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,309
-You can do it!
-Come on, Stuart!

357
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,948
If I get up then I might fall

358
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,509
If I get up then I might fall

359
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,114
If I get up then I might fall

360
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,759
We get up anyway

361
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,194
Again

362
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,028
There you go. That's yours.

363
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,117
And yours.

364
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,518
Hey, Stuart. Shark!

365
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,232
-I'm just kidding.
-I got this one.

366
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,869
Dad.

367
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:19,271
Your mother wouldn't be happy if
I let you strain your back, would she?

368
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,237
Everybody's supposed
to carry something.

369
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,479
Right.

370
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,558
Don't wrinkle your nose, Stuart.

371
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,950
These little packages
pack quite a punch.

372
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,588
-I guess.
-Here, a chocolate for later.

373
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,512
All right, listen up.
One, two, three, eyes on me.

374
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,799
That's not all that's on him.

375
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,794
Okay, now remember, scouts,
if you get lost in these woods...

376
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,393
...you're pretty much a goner.

377
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,357
No, no. He's joking, kids.

378
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:51,353
If you get lost,
hug a tree until we find you.

379
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,717
Now, everyone should
pair up with a buddy.

380
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,992
No scout left behind.

381
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,469
Hi, wanna be buddies?

382
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,674
Hi. Hey.

383
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,950
Hey, buddy, you have nothing
to worry about.

384
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,314
I'll be right behind you.

385
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,710
I'll be walking in your footprints
the whole way.

386
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,759
I'll be like a shadow.
Wherever you go, I'll be there.

387
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:21,992
Hey, hey, wait up. Wait for me.

388
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,991
All right. Tight lines, everybody.

389
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:40,836
George, try looking up.
The graphics are much better.

390
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,592
Great resolution.

391
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:45,035
Eyes straight ahead, scouts.
Keep up, keep up now.

392
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,272
Hey, guys. I can't get across.

393
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,873
Hey....

394
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:58,800
Don't worry. I'm okay.
No problem.

395
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,748
I'll catch up with you
around the next bend.

396
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,318
Dad. George.

397
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,672
Oh, dear.

398
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,191
A little bit of water
never hurt anybody.

399
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,231
I can handle this.

400
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:55,391
Well, if I get lost,
I'm supposed to hug a tree.

401
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:58,358
I didn't get lost, I got left.

402
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,834
Okay, okay, Stuart...

403
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,991
...you wanted adventure,
here's your chance.

404
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,668
You just have to find
your own way back.

405
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:07,877
Okay, let's see. The sun is there,
and we came from that way...

406
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,758
...so the scouts must be....

407
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:13,276
No, wait. No, if they were there....

408
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,078
No, they were over there.

409
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,993
So I should be there.
But I'm not there, I'm here.

410
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:21,391
Where am l?
I don't know where I am.

411
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:29,468
Hey, can anyone hear me?

412
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,430
A good scout should
assess the situation.

413
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,834
Creepy.

414
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:47,552
Okay, okay, Stuart, calm down.
There's nothing out there.

415
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,348
Before you know it...

416
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:54,640
...you're gonna start believing there
really is a bloodthirsty, ferocious--

417
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,838
Hello?

418
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,831
Hey, is somebody here?

419
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:13,511
-Beast!
-Beast? Where? No, no, please!

420
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,513
Me? Yeah, that's right.

421
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,830
I'm the Beast, believe that.

422
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,029
I'm big and I'm mean,
and I'm all sorts of scary. Yeah.

423
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:27,875
Actually, you're not as scary
as I thought you'd be.

424
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,957
Well, that's because
I'm not in a scary mood today.

425
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,678
Yeah, yeah, that's it.

426
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:38,230
In fact, what the heck,
I won't even eat you today.

427
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,550
-You won't?
-I'll just say:

428
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:45,156
-Yeah. This, on the other hand....
-Hey, wait a minute. That's mine.

429
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:48,790
-Oh, no, no, no. It was yours.
-That's mine.

430
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,598
Now it's the Beast's.

431
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:54,469
Who, remember
my little friend, is me.

432
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,996
It's the survival of the fittest, dude.

433
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,549
That's the way the Beast rolls.

434
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:06,756
Yo, something stinks.

435
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,832
And it's not me. The Beast!

436
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:22,835
-You're not the Beast, are you?
-You're quick, kid.

437
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,840
-You have better pickup than my car.
-You drive a car?

438
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,068
That was awesome.

439
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,273
Awesome?

440
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,590
Man, you were running and dodging
and swinging and sliding and--

441
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,910
Yeah, yeah, I recall some of that.

442
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,832
You are, like, the ultimate.

443
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,513
You are so cool.

444
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:57,911
Yo, I've been called
a lot of things, but never "cool."

445
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,992
Oh, yeah. I mean, that Beast
had nothing on you.

446
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:04,550
Yeah, it's true.
I don't sweat that Beast none.

447
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,756
I mean, frankly,
if you weren't there, kid...

448
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:10,117
...me and that Beast would've had
a throw down, a serious tussle.

449
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,111
And then, it would have been:

450
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,039
Face full of stink.

451
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,191
"Oh, no! Please, Reeko,
don't hit me there!"

452
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:21,033
Been like, "No, Beast."
"Please, Reeko!"

453
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,636
-Reeko?
-That's my name, kid.

454
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,951
R-E-E....

455
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,078
-Reeko.
-Stuart. Stuart Little.

456
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,310
Nice to meet you,
Stuart, Stuart Little.

457
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:36,040
Listen up. This is a beehive.

458
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:39,511
You can tell by its pale colouring
it is abandoned.

459
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,912
Actually, I'm afraid
you're wrong on this one too.

460
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,719
Nonsense, Little. Watch.

461
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,675
I'm not sure I can.

462
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,750
You really know your way
around these woods.

463
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:02,595
Nothing goes down in this forest
without me knowing about it.

464
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,878
-What was that?
-How would I know?

465
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:16,518
It's a man being stung in the butt
by a million bees.

466
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,238
Obviously, I knew that.

467
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,352
In the butt.

468
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:24,993
Well, I guess I gotta get going.

469
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:28,948
Yeah. Yeah, me too.
Yeah, you know, I'm busy.

470
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,510
I got lots of friend stuff
to take care of.

471
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:36,195
Lots of friends. I got folks coming over
and everything. I'm busy.

472
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,710
-Okay, I'll see you.
-Yep, later.

473
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,792
-Bye.
-I'm busy. Busy, busy....

474
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,468
It was beautiful.

475
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,231
Hey, Stuart.

476
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,789
George, I can explain.

477
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,473
That was kind of cool, huh?

478
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:00,114
Yeah, I never saw anything like it.

479
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,952
Come on, let's go.

480
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:04,156
They didn't miss me at all.

481
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:09,318
And what else? I replaced
several shingles on the roof...

482
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:12,950
...changed the washers in the faucets,
and weather-stripped the windows.

483
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:16,669
-Really? You did all that today?
-And some painting.

484
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:21,239
And as I was plastering the wall,
I could see the electrical was shot.

485
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,879
So I replaced the wiring too.

486
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:25,793
What happened to
"lazy days and carefree nights"?

487
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,678
Right after I finish the gazebo.

488
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:30,912
-Gazebo?
-I drew up the plans this afternoon.

489
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:32,989
Nothing too extravagant.

490
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,390
Just big enough to hold
the picnic table I built.

491
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:39,235
-Well, as long as you're having fun.
-Oh, I am.

492
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,037
How about you boys?
Are you having fun with the Scouts?

493
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,913
It's a little hard.

494
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,594
My natural abilities
haven't exactly kicked in yet.

495
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,716
Do you have new friends
who could help you?

496
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,950
Actually, I do.

497
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,630
He's the best.
And he knows everything.

498
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:07,080
Reeko? Hey, Reeko?

499
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,958
Where are you?

500
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,759
Must not be here.

501
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:13,673
Yo, Stuart, my man.

502
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,398
You lost again?

503
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:18,074
Because look, I am not running
a day care service here.

504
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,391
-I'm not lost. I was looking for you.
-Looking for me?

505
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:25,394
No one ever looks for me.
Do I owe you money?

506
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:29,553
Look, I need to earn
the gold kerchief.

507
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,670
It's a Scout thing.

508
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:35,559
I thought maybe you could teach me
that cool stuff you do.

509
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,756
-Like climbing and tracking and--
-What?

510
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:41,316
You want me to teach you
the ins and outs, the ups and downs?

511
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:44,756
-What I have cannot be taught.
-I'll pay you.

512
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,751
Cannot be taught overnight.

513
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:52,232
Yo, little man, you want me to impart
All my knowledge upon you?

514
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:55,073
Listen very carefully
Check this out

515
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,560
So you wanna get down
And be like me?

516
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,119
Well, you got a long way to go

517
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,714
So you wanna be down
But it's clear to me

518
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,757
You need to hang
With your man Reeko

519
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:09,629
I got a Ph.D. in forestology
Yo, man, the woods are my hood

520
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,836
You're a beginner
You don't wanna be a dinner

521
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,911
If you stick with me, it's all good
Sing!

522
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,709
Listen to Reeko
No one knows all that he knows

523
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,711
He's the skunk with the funk

524
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:22,758
That's me
Funky

525
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:25,480
-He's got savoir faire
-Coming out my derriere

526
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,834
-Because Reeko's--
-Funky

527
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,355
-He's so classy
-Sometimes gassy, but I don't care

528
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,317
-Because Reeko's--
-Funky

529
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,311
-I'm a bad brother skunk!
-Hold your nose

530
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,391
Say what?
I'm just talking about Reeko

531
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,994
So you wanna be a big man?
Put some bump in your jump

532
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,434
A glide in your stride

533
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,999
So you gotta be cool, man

534
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,720
When you hear--
You better be the first to hide

535
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,314
I know the hot spots
Where they got good grub

536
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,072
Man, you better listen to me

537
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,151
You like insects?
I love them bugs

538
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,390
Yo, I mean grubs, literally
Sing, girls

539
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:58,916
Listen to Reeko
No one knows all that he knows

540
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,071
He's the skunk with the funk

541
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:04,277
That's me
Funky

542
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,590
-He's got savoir faire
-Coming out my derriere

543
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,034
-Because Reeko's--
-Funky

544
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:11,078
-He's so classy
-Sometimes gassy, but yo, I don't care

545
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,593
-Because Reeko's--
-Funky

546
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:15,479
Being funky, hey that's my duty

547
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,710
Y'all move out the way
Stuart, move, man

548
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,393
I gotta move my booty
Hey

549
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,790
-Listen to Reeko
-Better listen to Reeko

550
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,234
No one knows all that he knows

551
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:27,188
He's the skunk with the funk
The smelly, smelly hunk

552
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:31,194
All this junk in my trunk
That's me

553
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,952
Reeko!

554
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,236
Thank you very much
Hey!

555
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:40,198
You know, Reeko, I'm really having
a good time this summer.

556
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,430
-I'm learning a lot.
-That's why you pay me.

557
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,909
Yeah, sure.

558
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:49,071
-Well, gotta go.
-Watch out for that.

559
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,708
Well, see you tomorrow, Reeko.

560
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,390
-Hey, Stuart.
-Yeah?

561
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:03,519
-You did good today, bro.
-Thanks, bro.

562
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,556
Hello. Hungry.

563
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:20,630
All right, all right.
I only have four legs.

564
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,552
That Monty's got some appetite.

565
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,199
Oh, no.

566
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,278
Snowbell, I'm sorry,
we're out of cat food.

567
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:31,716
Mr. Little will be back in an hour
with the groceries.

568
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,835
I've got to do something
about those pipes.

569
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,554
Hey, where you been?
I've been banging for 10 minutes.

570
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:54,553
Yes, well, there's a slight glitch
in room service.

571
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,312
The food won't be here
for an hour.

572
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,870
-Well, okay.
-I knew you'd understand.

573
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,349
I'll go find my own grub.

574
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,158
Monty.

575
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:13,155
-Monty, what are you doing?
-I'm getting some grub.

576
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,675
-You want some?
-You can't go.

577
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,796
You don't know what's in that forest.

578
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:23,192
Squirrels, bunny rabbits,
a monkey or two.

579
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,078
No, no. There's a....

580
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,071
-Monkey?
-Yeah.

581
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:30,118
Cute, furry monkeys
live in the forest.

582
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,633
Everybody knows that.

583
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,314
I'll address that misconception
at a later date.

584
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:37,119
There is a Beast in that forest!

585
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,510
Yeah, right.

586
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:43,229
This from a guy who doesn't believe
in forest monkeys.

587
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,789
How could you be so selfish?

588
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:50,476
If you get ripped limb from limb,
who's gonna look out for me?

589
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,754
Dead cat walking.

590
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:00,994
You're looking pretty cocky
for someone in your situation.

591
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,310
That Beast's got nothing on me.

592
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,630
Guess we'll see tonight.

593
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,198
Tonight?!

594
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,638
Monty?

595
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,995
Boy, am I glad you're back.
I was so worried.

596
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:34,232
I thought for sure
you'd been eaten by the....

597
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:35,869
Skunk.

598
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:38,873
Yo, relax, powder puff.
I'm here for Stuart. He around?

599
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:42,715
Stuart? And you know him how?

600
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,552
What do you mean, "how"?

601
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,472
You don't think we could be friends?

602
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:49,234
-Reeko?
-Hey, Stuart. My man!

603
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:52,312
-Yo, I was just telling this dustmop--
-What are you doing here?

604
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,597
What do you mean,
what am I doing here, man?

605
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:59,238
You're embarrassed
to be seen with a skunk.

606
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,759
-No, l....
-Well, "No, l" what?

607
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:06,708
My parents don't exactly know
I've been sneaking off.

608
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,312
Oh, I get it.

609
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,436
Hey, listen, yo, I need a favour.

610
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,591
How about an advance
on the next lesson?

611
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,512
Could you scrounge
something up for me?

612
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,910
-Stuart!
-Oh, man. My parents.

613
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:20,514
I'll try to get what I can for you
right after dinner.

614
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,398
Look, I got better things to do...

615
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,438
...than to hang around under the porch
until you finish dinner.

616
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:28,273
No, I meant after you have
dinner with us.

617
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,749
No, no. Look, don't even tr--

618
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,479
For real?

619
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,953
And no lie?

620
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,315
You really want me to sit down
with your family?

621
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:41,115
Yo, and I thought you were....

622
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,555
I've never been invited
anywhere before.

623
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:46,154
This is big.

624
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:52,909
Mom, Dad, I want you
to meet my friend, Reeko.

625
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,312
A kitty cat.

626
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,236
Hello there, Reeko.

627
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,993
Glad to meet you.

628
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,754
Well, aren't you adorable?

629
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:06,595
Mom, I invited him for dinner.
Is that okay?

630
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,199
It's....

631
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:16,319
It's getting stuffy in here.
I think I'll open a window.

632
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,959
Thanks, Mom. Great dinner.

633
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,556
No. Like this.

634
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,032
Got it.

635
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,992
So, Stuart...

636
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,913
...where did you and Reeko meet?

637
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,753
-Where? Well....
-Maybe I should tell them.

638
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,150
Yeah, Reeko, you go ahead.

639
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,151
Well, it was like this.

640
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,869
I was just....

641
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:54,031
And then, look at him now.

642
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,191
Well, I guess that
just about covers it.

643
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,952
-Right, Stuart?
-Yep.

644
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,951
Yep, it sure does.

645
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:24,033
Okay, Reeko. Thanks for stopping by.
I'll see you tomorrow.

646
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,518
Okay, maybe I'll see you
tomorrow too.

647
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,878
I've got some food for you.
It's right over here.

648
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,748
I hope this is enough.

649
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:47,552
It'll have to do.
You know, Stu, you all right.

650
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,791
-Thanks.
-No, man. I really mean it.

651
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,473
You're the only one I ever met...

652
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:56,200
...that didn't run forthe hills
when you saw me.

653
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:59,193
You didn't judge me,
and that goes a long way.

654
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:03,717
I tell you what,
next favour, it's on me.

655
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:07,829
Yeah. Well, keep it real, man.

656
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,078
I will.

657
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,112
Bye.

658
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:20,553
Oh man, who am I kidding?
I owe the Beast way more.

659
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:24,156
That much food just doesn't
appear out of nowhere.

660
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:33,396
Slap my tail and call me stinky.

661
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:41,789
-Are you still here?
-No, I was just going off to the party.

662
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,678
-Party?
-Who told you about the party?

663
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,558
-Know what, Snowflake?
-It's Snowbell.

664
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:48,757
I'd love to get you in
but it's A list only.

665
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:53,277
-Very exclusive. You have to be cool.
-Well, I'm very good at charades.

666
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:56,876
That counts. It starts when the moon
rises in the clearing...

667
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,315
...just on the other side
of those trees.

668
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:02,517
No, forget it. There's a vicious,
cat-eating beast out there.

669
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:05,114
Oh, yeah. Right, right.

670
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,158
-You gonna believe that fairy tale?
-What do you mean?

671
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,557
Cowbell, baby.

672
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,792
Did you ever see
this so-called Beast?

673
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:17,555
-No. Not exactly.
-Me either, kid. And I live out there.

674
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:20,757
Dude, you'd think I'd run across
this legendary Beast...

675
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,911
-...once or twice, right?
-I guess.

676
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,354
And let me ask you, bro...

677
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:27,273
...do you think all the animals
would be getting together...

678
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,591
...getting their groove on at night,
in the woods...

679
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:33,228
...if this supposed Beast
actually existed?

680
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,674
Now that you mention it...

681
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:38,549
...that kid who told us that story
did look a little shifty.

682
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,431
Can I bring anything?

683
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:46,434
Just yourself. You are definitely
gonna add some flavour.

684
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:49,558
Now, remember,
tell them Reeko sent you.

685
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:53,793
And don't mention this to Stuart.
No dis, but he's not hip like you.

686
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:57,475
I do have sort of
a subtle hipness, don't l?

687
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:01,592
Don't worry, my lips are sealed.
At least until tonight.

688
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,074
Where's he going?

689
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,838
-Big man
-Big man

690
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,560
Big man on the block

691
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:55,872
Hello. I am Snowbell
of the Manhattan Bells.

692
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,393
Big man

693
00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:00,028
Reeko sent me.

694
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:02,760
-On the block
-Yeah, I'm the big man

695
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:05,957
-Big man
-Big man on the block

696
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:08,680
The big man on the block

697
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:10,432
Reeko sent me.

698
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,909
Do you enjoy charades?

699
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:16,311
I'm the man with the biggest walk
Yeah

700
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:20,473
That's it. Walk right on in.

701
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:23,354
I hope the Beast likes take out.

702
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:27,356
Have no fear, the party is here.

703
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:31,314
Name's Snowbell.
Just in from the city.

704
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:33,311
New York City.

705
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:35,198
Rubes.

706
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:37,715
The big man on the block

707
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:40,753
Snowbell?

708
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,152
Where are you?

709
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,868
They probably think
I'm crashing the party.

710
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:50,437
Hey, guys, it's all right.
I'm on the A list.

711
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:54,117
-He's on the menu.
-Reeko sent me.

712
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,398
They were probably the caterers.

713
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:09,992
It's the Mount Everest of edibles.

714
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,237
Snowbell?

715
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:18,631
Time for this cat to pig out.

716
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:22,271
Now, this is what I call
a food pyramid.

717
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:25,632
All my favourite food groups
are here.

718
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,835
Snowbell. Oh, dear.

719
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,070
Pizza, donuts. Oh, yeah.

720
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:32,434
Get out of there!

721
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:36,395
Top of the world, Ma!

722
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:56,999
Hang on, Snowbell. I'm coming!

723
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:14,275
I gotta go get help.

724
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:23,875
You're making a huge mistake.

725
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:26,190
I will give you such a hairball.

726
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:29,193
You'll hack and cough forweeks.

727
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:41,269
-Rise and shine.
-Good morning, boys.

728
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:42,759
Mom, Dad.

729
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:46,356
Snowbell and I were out in the woods,
and the Beast got him.

730
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:47,999
-Nightmare.
-Nightmare.

731
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,798
No, no, it's real.
We gotta save him.

732
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:53,873
-Sounds like quite a dream.
-But it wasn't a dream.

733
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:56,833
Come on downstairs
and have breakfast.

734
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:02,798
George?

735
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:05,719
-What?
-I need your help.

736
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,635
You don't wanna eat me.
I taste terrible.

737
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:12,712
I should know,
I lick myself every day.

738
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,070
Don't speak.

739
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:20,674
Your fur is so soft.

740
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:23,354
It's not like the other animals
in the forest.

741
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:26,432
Theirs is coarse with burrs.

742
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:29,956
But yours is clean and silky.

743
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,554
Well, I do try my best
to take care of it.

744
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:35,632
Regular tongue baths
and good grooming.

745
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:40,789
I have different plans for you.

746
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:43,872
Madam, I had no idea.

747
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:46,759
I mean, it's not that you're
entirely unattractive.

748
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:49,275
And I'm not opposed
to a summer fling, per se.

749
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:53,149
-I just don't think it would work out.
-I don't want you.

750
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:56,198
I want your fur.

751
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:59,593
Well, thank goodness, beca--

752
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:01,074
My fur?

753
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:03,348
For a rug.

754
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,317
It gets cold here in the winter.

755
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:08,677
Gee, as much as I'd love to help out
with your home decorating...

756
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:10,671
...I'm rather attached to my fur.

757
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:12,632
That won't be a problem
much longer.

758
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:16,677
Wait, wait. Maybe you could...

759
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:18,598
...fatten me up for a while.

760
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:23,151
Yeah, you'd have a bigger rug.
More spacious.

761
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:26,876
You're right.

762
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,471
Eat.

763
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:47,876
-What is this?
-Eat or be eaten.

764
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:56,108
Don't you have anything in a can?

765
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:00,111
Guys, guys. We need to organize
a search party right away.

766
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:03,033
-What happened?
-It's Snowbell. He's been kidnapped.

767
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:04,997
-Now, Stuart.
-You gotta believe me!

768
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:07,390
-Who took him?
-The Beast.

769
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:09,278
-The Beast?
-Oh, yeah.

770
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:11,158
-Oh, come on.
-Watch out behind you.

771
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:13,356
-Tell them, Brooke.
-Oh, Stuart.

772
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:15,954
That was just an old campfire story.

773
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:19,112
I was just messing with you.
The Beast isn't real.

774
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:22,352
Yeah, a phoney, just like Stuart.

775
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:24,317
-Can't believe he fell for that.
-Loser.

776
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:27,233
I'm telling you the truth.
Snowbell's in big trouble.

777
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:30,915
Really? Was he taken by the shark?

778
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:33,754
Sorry, Stuart.

779
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:36,354
-Now what am I gonna do?
-Just forget about it.

780
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:38,556
He'll be back once he gets hungry.

781
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,749
I gotta help Snowbell.

782
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,755
We're all living in a world so scary
Can you find a place to hide?

783
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:49,953
You come unravelled
When the bones are rattled

784
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:52,634
In the closet of your life

785
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:57,476
Will you fit tomorrow
When the shadows come to light?

786
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:03,558
It's never fun to be the only one
To keep us safe inside

787
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:08,637
Here I come to save the world

788
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:15,835
Enter hero of the day
Who's come to save the world

789
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:28,035
Dear George, I have gone
to the other side of the lake...

790
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:30,395
...to save Snowbell from the Beast.

791
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:33,154
Please tell Mom and Dad
not to worry.

792
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:37,238
P.S. You were a good brother.

793
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:41,316
P.P.S. If I don't come back...

794
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:42,754
...you can have my car.

795
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:48,674
-You wanna go around the lake again?
-Sure.

796
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:50,512
Hey, guys, wait for me.

797
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:46,358
Hi, George. Want to be
my buddy on the hike today?

798
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:48,476
-Sure.
-Sweet.

799
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:50,312
Need a hand?

800
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,638
Thanks for the hand.

801
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:58,318
No problem.

802
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:17,675
Reeko, where are you?

803
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:20,078
Reeko!

804
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:22,754
Yo, hey, Stuart.
What brings you here, man?

805
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:25,753
-The Beast took Snowbell.
-I'm sorry to hear that.

806
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:28,593
Wow, he was a great guy.
Let's take a moment of silence.

807
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:29,795
Okay, done.

808
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:33,032
I'm sure we'll all miss him.
Take care now.

809
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,873
-We gotta save him.
-That's nuts.

810
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:39,794
-Not if we do it together.
-Yo, now you are really talking crazy.

811
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:42,758
I'm staying as far away
from the Beast as I can.

812
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:45,388
But you said
you don't sweat the Beast.

813
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:50,998
Yeah, yeah, Stuart.
I said that. Listen carefully.

814
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:53,350
I was lying.

815
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:57,115
-Lying?
-Yeah, I do that.

816
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,998
I'm just a skunk.

817
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:04,992
A rotten, unpopular, smelly,
freeloading skunk.

818
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:09,199
Ask anyone, they'll tell you.
I'd never fight the Beast.

819
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:12,716
That was something I just said so,
you know...

820
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,518
...you'd like me.

821
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:16,671
Well, I liked you anyway.

822
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:21,311
Reeko, I'm going.
With or without you.

823
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:23,072
Then....

824
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:25,231
Then I'd say it's without me.

825
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:31,392
Stuart. Wait up, will you?

826
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:33,471
Snowbell's history, man.

827
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:35,551
There's nothing you can
do for him now.

828
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:37,553
Stu, why don't you listen to me?

829
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:40,154
Because it's my fault.

830
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:44,438
I saw him, but I didn't
get to him in time.

831
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:48,673
Dude, you weren't the one who sent
him straight into the jaws of the Beast.

832
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:53,836
Sent him? Wait a minute.
What do you mean, "sent him"?

833
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,831
Listen, Stu...

834
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:57,628
...I can explain.

835
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:00,155
And I thought you were my friend.

836
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:02,436
Why would you do that?

837
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:07,075
It's complicated.

838
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:14,113
The Beast is a cruel,
heartless monster.

839
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:17,559
She doesn't care about
anybody but herself.

840
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:20,069
Then you two must have
a lot in common.

841
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:24,676
Stu, slow down.

842
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:28,674
Slow down and think
about what you're doing.

843
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:29,955
It's too risky, man.

844
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:34,079
When it comes to friends,
sometimes you gotta take a risk.

845
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:37,313
-Kid's got a point.
-What y'all looking at?

846
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:40,069
Any of you wanna join him?

847
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:42,756
I didn't think so.

848
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:48,551
-Come on.
-You can do it.

849
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:51,473
-Pull!
-Pull!

850
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:59,158
-Bee.
-Bee! Bee!

851
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:02,517
Man, Elwin. You rock.

852
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,753
Come on, scouts.
Time to scrub the toilets.

853
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:09,239
Who's excited?

854
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:23,913
Hold it.

855
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,995
And what do you have
to say about this?

856
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:29,950
Scouts do not litter.

857
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:34,591
Remember, take only memories,
leave only footprints.

858
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:48,635
That's really high.

859
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:15,677
Hey, you up there.

860
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:17,478
Can't we talk this over?

861
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:19,958
You don't have to kill me.

862
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:22,998
I'll be a good rug.
I'll just lie real flat.

863
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:25,799
-I won't move a muscle all winter.
-Pathetic.

864
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:36,679
-Little high, Little low.
-Little hey, Little ho.

865
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:39,154
Honey, please.

866
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:42,198
Not in front of the scouts.
Diminishes my authority.

867
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:46,799
-Be careful. You'll lose that.
-Hey, where's Stuart?

868
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:48,513
I thought he was with you.

869
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:52,195
Now, sweetie, I'm sure
he's perfectly safe.

870
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:55,188
-Stuart!
-Stuart!

871
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:57,794
-Stuart, are you here? Stuart!
-Stuart, where are you?

872
00:55:57,960 --> 00:55:59,234
Stuart?

873
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:47,634
I'd know that sound anywhere.

874
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:49,597
Snowbell, are you all right?

875
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:53,472
-Snowbell?
-I'm so delirious, I'm hearing voices.

876
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:58,435
Great, now I'm hallucinating.

877
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:07,074
Snowbell, step through the loop.

878
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:10,596
Well, at least I conjured up
a mirage with a plan.

879
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:20,679
Yeah.

880
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:34,396
-Am I glad to see you.
-You look like my friend Stuart.

881
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:37,313
Only much braver
and better looking.

882
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:40,119
-I will call you Larry.
-Snap out of it.

883
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:45,192
Stuart? It is you.
What are you doing here?

884
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:48,511
And what have you done
with Larry? Larry! Larry!

885
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:54,874
Come on, we gotta get out of here.

886
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:58,113
-Son, are you in there?
-Stuart!

887
00:57:58,280 --> 00:57:59,872
-Stuart!
-I can't find him.

888
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:01,758
Stuart, where are you?

889
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:04,795
Stuart, honey.

890
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:07,520
-I haven't seen him.
-Oh, no.

891
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:10,917
-Stuart's gone into the forest alone.
-Listen up.

892
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:13,913
We gotta take this search party
to the other side of the lake.

893
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:17,709
Now, now, hold on a second.
Isn't this a bit much?

894
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:21,111
If you ask me, I'd say your boy is
just looking for a little attention.

895
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:22,872
What's that supposed to mean?

896
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:25,955
First, we had the shark
in the lake story.

897
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:30,272
Now, it's a beast in the woods story.
What's next here? Sasquatch?

898
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:32,112
Let's get one thing straight.

899
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:35,238
If my son says
there's a beast out there...

900
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:38,119
...then, by golly,
there's a beast out there.

901
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:40,350
Yeah. My brother's not a liar.

902
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:43,717
-What about "no scout left behind"?
-Yeah. She's right.

903
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:46,758
-Come on, Stuart's one of us.
-Okay, all right.

904
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:50,515
Well, I guess it'll give me a chance
to try out my new GPS.

905
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:54,358
Why am I seeing killer robots
in lava fields?

906
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:55,555
Okay, listen.

907
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:59,998
Scouts, my boy is lost in the woods.
We're wasting time.

908
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:02,674
You, you go with Mr. Little.
This group, come with me.

909
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:04,910
Fan out and cover as much
ground as possible.

910
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:07,548
-I love it when she does that. Let's go.
-Come on.

911
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:11,877
Careful.
The Beast is sleeping out there.

912
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:18,109
-She must've left.
-And I say good riddance.

913
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:20,111
What a nut job.

914
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:22,954
Do you know what she wanted
to do with my fur?

915
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:25,588
I'm reporting her to PETA.

916
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:27,875
Run!

917
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:29,632
I don't think so.

918
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:31,711
I need you here.

919
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:34,355
He really ties the cave together.

920
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:36,988
Let him go or I'll let you have it.

921
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:39,431
-I'm shaking.
-I warned you.

922
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:54,675
Packs quite a punch.

923
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:58,389
Great form, top-notch execution,
but too much splash upon entry.

924
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:00,471
Overall, I give a 9.5.

925
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:08,997
-Let's get out of here.
-I'm right behind you.

926
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:13,279
Stu.

927
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:17,871
Stuart wasn't making it up.

928
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:20,918
Well, you know, that might not
have been an animal roar at all.

929
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:24,231
It could easily have been
some kind of avalanche.

930
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:27,597
Does that look like an avalanche?

931
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:30,191
-He's a goner.
-Poor Stuart.

932
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:31,588
-Poor guy.
-He's a goner.

933
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:37,232
Stuart, buddy, you were my first
real friend, and I did you wrong.

934
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:42,551
Is that Reeko actually thinking
about someone else for a change?

935
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:45,792
Yeah. Yeah, Stuart had
the right idea.

936
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:48,997
I should've had the courage to
stand up to the Beast a long time ago.

937
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:52,311
Maybe none of it would've happened.
There isn't one of y'all here...

938
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:54,789
...that I haven't begged, borrowed
or mooched from.

939
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:59,078
Rabbit, that thing with your carrots,
I didn't know you needed them to see.

940
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:02,437
And, Beaver, about the overbite jokes,
I'm sorry.

941
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:06,229
But, guys, look, maybe together
we have a chance.

942
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:10,518
I don't know about y'all, but I'm sick
and tired of living in fear of that Beast.

943
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:13,478
It's time that we got together
and we did something, y'all.

944
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:15,153
Who's with me here?

945
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:19,677
-Sounds good, but....
-You know, it's just too risky.

946
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:23,116
This little dude once told me
that when it comes to friends...

947
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:26,670
...sometimes you got to take a risk.

948
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:29,035
I'm gonna go save my friend.

949
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:31,839
With or without y'all.

950
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:35,192
-Don't go!
-You'll never be able...

951
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:37,954
...to fight the Beast yourself.

952
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:44,356
The Beast is catching up.

953
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:46,795
Snowbell, I got a plan...

954
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:48,678
...but I can't do it without you.

955
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:51,513
I don't know how much
I got left in me.

956
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:53,511
-ls your heart still beating?
-A little.

957
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:57,468
Good. Because we need to start
pulling roots, leaves and branches.

958
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:00,357
We're landscaping?

959
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:03,717
Forgive me if I'm not overwhelmed
with confidence.

960
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:39,390
We give up. You win.

961
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:42,996
Oh, come on.
Don't give up the chase just yet.

962
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:47,472
-I was having such fun.
-We can't run anymore.

963
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:53,955
It's true. Look at me.
I'm in no condition for this.

964
01:02:56,120 --> 01:02:58,714
-A trap?
-Oh, no.

965
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:01,792
Clever.

966
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:07,351
But not clever enough.

967
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:09,954
All right, lady, don't make me
get tough with--

968
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:13,711
So I'm trying to decide.

969
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:17,793
Should I eat you in one bite,
or should I knock you around first?

970
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:21,475
You know how we cats
like to play with our food.

971
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:23,514
Yo, Beast.

972
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:25,754
Back it up.

973
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:28,514
-You came.
-That's right, little man.

974
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:31,240
Yo, Beast, you wanna eat them...

975
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:33,960
...you're gonna have to go
through me first.

976
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:37,476
Ridiculous. You're so small.

977
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:40,950
-How could you possibly stop me?
-He's got backup.

978
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:44,192
-I'm with Reeko.
-Me too.

979
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:47,716
-Me too.
-You're not so scary now, are you?

980
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:51,077
-Yeah, look at you.
-Come on, everybody.

981
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:57,158
What's the matter, kitty cat?
Scared of a little old skunk?

982
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:04,036
You wouldn't.

983
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:05,474
Talk to the butt.

984
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:15,954
Reeko.

985
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:19,715
Squirrel, go. Beave, go.

986
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,753
-Here, kitty, kitty.
-You need to pack that.

987
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:26,708
-Hey, stink face.
-I can smell you, can you smell me?

988
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,877
Hey, Beast. I'm over here.

989
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:32,516
Look at Stuart.

990
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:36,999
Your decorating days are done.

991
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:49,749
Yeah, you did it!

992
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:55,316
-Where's Stuart?
-He was here a second ago.

993
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:57,277
-I just saw him.
-Where is he?

994
01:05:01,240 --> 01:05:02,229
Hi.

995
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:04,837
Need a hand?

996
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:10,277
-Stuart.
-Stuart.

997
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:12,192
-Stuart.
-Hey, over here.

998
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:13,588
Stuart!

999
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:15,478
Stuart!

1000
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:19,556
-Stuart! Wow, awesome.
-Nice!

1001
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:23,474
Stuart, honey,
get away from the Beast.

1002
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:26,871
Oh, Mom, she can't
hurt anyone now.

1003
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:31,670
Or ever again,
thanks to my man, Stuart.

1004
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:34,559
Ranger One inbound to the zoo.
We got a stinker here.

1005
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:36,836
We're gonna have
to dart it and shave it.

1006
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,956
This one needs a bath.

1007
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:44,993
Congratulations, son.
You've earned that gold kerchief.

1008
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:47,799
You've made me troud
to be your poopmaster.

1009
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:50,119
Thanks.

1010
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:10,438
-Hey, little guy.
-All right!

1011
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:12,079
Can I be your buddy next summer?

1012
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:16,677
And I'd like to apologize
for ever doubting Stuart.

1013
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:20,753
-He's quite extraordinary.
-That's our boy.

1014
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:26,040
-No, that's our little man.
-Oh, Mom.

1015
01:06:36,680 --> 01:06:40,514
-Monty, is that you?
-Yep, in the flesh.

1016
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:43,319
I thought the Beast got you.
Where have you been?

1017
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:44,993
Just over the hill.

1018
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:47,720
It was everything
you said it would be.

1019
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:51,475
-What are you talking about?
-The Hartz Mountain Resort and Spa.

1020
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:56,998
Awesome. Massage, food,
pampering. It was heaven.

1021
01:06:57,160 --> 01:07:00,914
-lf it was so good, why'd you leave?
-Well, it closed for the season.

1022
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:04,675
Well, gotta go hide. Hope I still fit.

1023
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:09,478
I'm gonna miss you, George.

1024
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:11,790
-You won't forget me, will you?
-No way.

1025
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:14,428
Here, I want you to have this.

1026
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:18,832
And if you need any help,
I know all the shortcuts to every level.

1027
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:23,876
You can call me at this number
or text message me at this one.

1028
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:26,600
And that's my email address,
my website...

1029
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:28,512
...my user name and password.

1030
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:30,959
Thanks.

1031
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:35,079
Well, I only have one thing for you.

1032
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:38,752
Sweet.

1033
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:43,070
So you out of here, huh?

1034
01:07:43,240 --> 01:07:45,674
I just wanted to thank you
for everything.

1035
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:47,831
This summer turned out
better than I hoped.

1036
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,230
-Reeko, coming tonight?
-Can't start without you.

1037
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:52,595
You got a few friends
to keep you company.

1038
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:54,751
Yeah. Funny thing, though.

1039
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:57,957
I always thought they didn't want me
around because I was a skunk.

1040
01:07:58,120 --> 01:08:02,238
Well, you know, it turns out they didn't
want me around because I was a jerk.

1041
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:05,472
But all that's changed,
thanks to you, little man.

1042
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:07,597
Glad I could help.

1043
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:10,194
-Stuart, time to go.
-Come on, honey.

1044
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:12,555
Yeah, okay. I'll be right there.

1045
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:15,234
Yo, you take care.

1046
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:16,879
Yeah.

1047
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:18,794
You too.

1048
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:27,668
Hey, Stuart.

1049
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:30,230
I'm gonna miss you, bro.

1050
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:33,951
I'm gonna miss you too.

1051
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:56,995
So you wanna get down
And be like me

1052
01:08:57,160 --> 01:08:58,559
Well, you got a long way to go

1053
01:08:58,720 --> 01:09:00,995
So you wanna be down
But it's clear to me

1054
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:02,991
You need to hang
With your man Reeko

1055
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:07,119
I got a Ph.D. in forestology
Yo, man, the woods are my hood

1056
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:09,316
You're a beginner
You don't wanna be a dinner

1057
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:11,391
If you stick with me it's all good
Sing!

1058
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:14,950
Listen to Reeko
No one knows all that he knows

1059
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:17,236
He's the skunk with the funk

1060
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:20,198
That's me
Funky

1061
01:09:20,360 --> 01:09:22,828
-He's got savoir faire
-Coming out my derriere

1062
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,194
-Because Reeko's--
-Funky

1063
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:26,828
-He's so classy
-Sometimes gassy, but I don't care

1064
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,752
-Because Reeko's--
-Funky

1065
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:30,831
-I'm a bad brother skunk!
-Hold your nose

1066
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:34,310
Say what?
I'm just talking about Reeko

1067
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:38,679
So you wanna be a big man?
Put some bump in your jump

1068
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:40,114
A glide in your stride

1069
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:41,474
So you gotta be cool, man

1070
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:44,200
When you hear--
You better be the first to hide

1071
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:46,669
I know the hot spots
Where they got good grub

1072
01:09:46,840 --> 01:09:48,512
Man, you better listen to me

1073
01:09:48,680 --> 01:09:50,750
You like insects?
I love them bugs

1074
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:52,831
Yo, I mean grubs, literally
Sing girls

1075
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:56,470
Listen to Reeko
No one knows all that he knows

1076
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:58,596
He's the skunk with the funk

1077
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:01,593
That's me
Funky

1078
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:04,228
-He's got savoir faire
-Coming out my derriere

1079
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:05,628
-Because Reeko's--
-Funky

1080
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:08,360
-He's so classy
-Sometimes gassy, but yo, I don't care

1081
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:09,999
-Because Reeko's--
-Funky

1082
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:12,833
Being funky, hey that's my duty

1083
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,150
Y'all move out the way
Stuart, move, man

1084
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:17,436
I gotta move my booty
Hey

1085
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:19,511
Watch me
Hey

1086
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:21,636
Watch out for the tail, now
Just watch me

1087
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:23,392
Reeko

1088
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:26,279
Just make it skunky

1089
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:28,271
Can I take it to the bridge?
Stuart

1090
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:30,351
Can I take it to the bridge?

1091
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:33,269
Stuart, you are so square
Come on, girls

1092
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:36,750
Listen to Reeko
No one knows all that he knows

1093
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:38,797
Don't suppose that your nose knows

1094
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:40,951
More than Reeko, the pro's nose

1095
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:43,429
-So just listen to Reeko
-Better listen to Reeko

1096
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:44,874
No one knows all that he knows

1097
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:48,874
He's the skunk with the funk
He's a smelly, smelly hunk

1098
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:52,237
All this junk in my trunk
That's me

1099
01:10:53,160 --> 01:10:55,151
Reeko!

1100
01:10:55,560 --> 01:10:58,279
Thank you very much
Hey!

1101
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:18,508
If your head keeps spinning
Because someone else is winning

1102
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:21,399
And you lost
In a game of chance

1103
01:11:21,560 --> 01:11:24,632
Where every time you make
A little decision

1104
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:29,351
It's like nuclear fission
Life explodes right in your lap

1105
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:32,589
Now's the time to stop
Look around

1106
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:34,637
Get both feet on the ground

1107
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:37,360
Dig the view
Take your foot off the gas

1108
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:39,112
You're moving way too fast

1109
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:42,636
You don't need to worry
Slow down, hey what's the hurry?

1110
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:46,031
Take your time, baby
Just relax

1111
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:50,629
And don't look back
Forget about tomorrow

1112
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:53,439
Right now is where it's at

1113
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:56,558
And don't you know
That you are right on track

1114
01:11:56,720 --> 01:11:58,676
And time is only borrowed

1115
01:11:58,840 --> 01:12:01,638
And you know wherever
You are

1116
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:04,268
Is where it's at

1117
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:09,834
