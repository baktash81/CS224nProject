1
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:46,503
It gives me great pleasure to welcome
the director of the Institute

2
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:47,754
and my old friend,

3
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,677
Dr. Andreas Jacobsen.

4
00:02:58,053 --> 00:02:59,054
Thank you.

5
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:04,276
Thank you. Thank you, Dr. Pereira.

6
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:08,113
Seventy-five years ago, Ms. Nellie Edvardsen,

7
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:11,692
overcome with guilt by the fortune
her late husband's family had amassed

8
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:14,611
producing mustard gas during World War I,

9
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:16,788
founded our Institute

10
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:20,459
so that the wonders of science
could instead be used to help mankind.

11
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,874
In the 1950s,

12
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:26,798
the Institute identified overpopulation

13
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:30,719
as mankind's single greatest
long-term threat.

14
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,513
The cause of all the catastrophes
we are seeing today,

15
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,883
extreme climate and weather events,

16
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:39,641
and the devastating impact on
food and water security.

17
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,815
Among the many solutions
we conceived so many years ago,

18
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:48,692
one, which seemed then so ambitious,
so out of our grasp,

19
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:51,030
has finally borne fruit.

20
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:53,320
And today, we are proud to unveil

21
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,154
what we fervently believe
to be the only practical,

22
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,283
humane and inclusive remedy

23
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:00,582
to humanity's gravest problem.

24
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:05,459
My colleague, Dr. Jorgen Asbjørnsen,
will now present his findings.

25
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:08,002
Are you ready, Doctor?

26
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:09,833
Yes, I'm ready.

27
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:39,287
Please take your seats.

28
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,117
Please sit down,
ladies and gentlemen, please.

29
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:45,205
Please take your seats, ladies and gentlemen.

30
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,128
Thank you very much. Thank you.

31
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:49,381
Thank you, thank you.

32
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:58,390
Dr. Pereira, esteemed colleagues.

33
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:04,730
Five years ago, building on the research
of our predecessors at the Institute,

34
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:07,850
my team and I discovered a process

35
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:12,279
by which all organic material
can be reduced at the cellular level

36
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:17,986
by a ratio of approximately 2,744 to 1.

37
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:22,489
Such a process converts a man of 1.8 meters

38
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:25,751
to just 12.9 centimeters.

39
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:31,006
A wide array of flora and fauna
were subjected in this process,

40
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:34,839
and, with the exception
of some fish and shellfish,

41
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:38,760
absolutely no side effects were detected.

42
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:40,594
Please, lights.

43
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:47,306
Once the safety of
the procedure was confirmed,

44
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:52,272
36 brave volunteers joined
my wife Anne-Helene and me

45
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:55,902
as the very first humans
to undergo cellular reduction.

46
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:58,987
The process is short and painless,

47
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:00,865
with only the mild discomfort of

48
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:05,290
removal and replacement of dental
and other prosthetics.

49
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:08,622
The subjects are placed under light sedation

50
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:13,458
and after a brief rest,
fully recover within an hour or two.

51
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:24,719
Once completed, our little village,
just 7 meters by 11 meters,

52
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:28,848
was placed inside a gas-permeable enclosure

53
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,979
designed to protect us from the hazards of

54
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:35,146
weather, animals and insects.

55
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:37,400
Thus, we set about to live together

56
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:42,486
in the world's very first
self-sustaining community of the small.

57
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:47,078
I hold here in my hand

58
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:52,918
all of the uncompostable waste
produced by 36 people over four years.

59
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:04,094
In this afternoon's session, we will outline

60
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:07,347
our proposal for a two to
three hundred-year transition

61
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:10,431
for the world to transform
from big into small.

62
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:12,357
But for now,

63
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:16,024
I'd like you all to meet some
very special people. Come.

64
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:22,359
Bravo!

65
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:50,809
And look, there is Little Ronni Nestrud,

66
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:53,519
the first small baby ever born,

67
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:57,149
and his new little sister Ulrikke.

68
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:49,783
<i>Jorgen Asbjørnsen of the Edvardsen Institute,</i>

69
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:53,117
<i>himself now only 10 centimeters tall
and weighing just 18 grams,</i>

70
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:55,160
<i>explained the rationale behind the invention.</i>

71
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:59,293
That is wild, isn't it? Just wild.

72
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:00,877
Say, Holly?

73
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:03,676
You can go ahead and put
the takeout order in. Thanks.

74
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,526
- Is that you?
- Yeah.

75
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:30,745
You hungry?

76
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:33,240
I ate about an hour ago.

77
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:35,249
I didn't know when you were coming.

78
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:36,955
You knew I was bringing food.

79
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:39,457
I called you and asked you specifically,
and then you go and eat?

80
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:41,835
Just a sesame chicken! I'm still hungry.

81
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,093
Did you see the news today?

82
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:53,177
- About the little Swedish man?
- Norwegian.

83
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:57,392
Helen called to tell me to turn on the TV.

84
00:09:57,472 --> 00:09:58,935
What won't they think of next?

85
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,016
Unbelievable.

86
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,024
Biggest thing since landing
on the moon. Bigger!

87
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:04,354
I don't get it.

88
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:07,236
Why would anybody want to do that to himself?

89
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:09,951
They can shrink people down

90
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,203
and fly to Mars,

91
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,874
but they can't cure my fibromyalgia?

92
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:21,289
And all this fuss about the environment

93
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,420
as though the world's going to end tomorrow.

94
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,298
I'm in pain.

95
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:30,889
I can't breathe! Doesn't that matter?

96
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:33,558
Lots of people are in pain, Mom,

97
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:36,303
in all sorts of ways.

98
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:14,424
...tingling?

99
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,009
- More like tingling.
- Tingling, okay.

100
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:20,810
<i>This downsizing thing is simply
runaway-train technology</i>

101
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:24,397
<i>that's having a devastating impact
on our world economy.</i>

102
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:27,901
<i>We're losing billions of dollars
in consumer spending already.</i>

103
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:30,566
<i>It's hurting us in construction, automobile,</i>

104
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:31,945
<i>housing and defense.</i>

105
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:33,902
<i>And then, of course, when we get to politics?</i>

106
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:36,199
<i>Israelis shrinking Palestinians,</i>

107
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:38,703
<i>African dictators shrinking
rival ethnic groups.</i>

108
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:42,038
<i>Look, Ron, in any major
transformation of society,</i>

109
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:44,872
<i>are there serious growing pains? Sure.</i>

110
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:49,089
<i>But at current mass and volume,
human life on Earth is unsustainable.</i>

111
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:52,046
You know, that one guy makes a good point.

112
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:54,506
This family on my block
just moved away to get small.

113
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:56,136
Now their house is just sitting there.

114
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:59,345
Making everybody's values take
a dive is what they're doing

115
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:01,521
and just when I'm trying to refinance.

116
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:04,273
Marlene thinks I should do it
just to lose the weight.

117
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:08,228
You and me both, buddy.

118
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,943
Hey, Dee, is that takeout order about ready?

119
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,822
Hey, honey, I brought food!

120
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:17,495
I'm not hungry.

121
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:26,663
What's wrong?

122
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,083
I have a splitting headache.

123
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:30,753
The store was super busy,

124
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,673
and Carla was a total bitch on wheels.

125
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,596
I feel like I'm going to throw up.

126
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:37,515
Here, let me do the neck thing.

127
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:40,594
Yeah, do the little neck thing.

128
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:44,438
Just relax, honey.

129
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:47,188
Let me take all the weight.

130
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:51,605
<i>Okay, here is
the beautiful formal living room</i>

131
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:53,777
with the wonderful fireplace.

132
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,863
And come around here, and we have

133
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:59,365
the nice big breakfast area for the kitchen.

134
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,118
Big eating area.

135
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:04,789
And this kitchen is just a complete wow.

136
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:07,328
No, it's awesome. I just think

137
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:09,665
maybe we should look again
at that place in Benson.

138
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,878
Come on, let's just check out the rest.

139
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:13,210
This is great in here.

140
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,883
Double oven, six-burner gas stove.

141
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,843
<i>It's got this wonderful
butler's pantry over here,</i>

142
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:20,596
<i>granite counter top...</i>

143
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,511
- Hey, Sean.
- Hey, Paul. How you doing?

144
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:02,592
Good.

145
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:08,144
- Do I look fat?
- No, you look very handsome.

146
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:13,565
Anesthesiology?

147
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:16,611
My wife says I put people to
sleep even without the drugs.

148
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,363
I'm surprised you're still awake.

149
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,778
He uses that joke like twice a week.

150
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:24,909
- What's your field, Paul?
- Occupational therapy.

151
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:27,367
- Okay.
- Like career counseling?

152
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,497
No, it's just like physical therapy,

153
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:32,376
but focused on workplace injuries and rehab.

154
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:35,461
Repetitive stress, lower back,
that sort of thing.

155
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,884
A lot of shoulder problems.

156
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,383
I'm in-house over at Omaha Steaks.

157
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,047
He does a lot of paperwork.

158
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:43,177
Yeah, well, I get a little
carpal tunnel of my own

159
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:44,884
- from time to time.
- Tell me about it.

160
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:47,971
Medicine these days
is all about covering your ass.

161
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:50,398
Hey, Paul, weren't you pre-med
down in Lincoln?

162
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:53,146
Good memory. Yeah, I put in two years.

163
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:54,314
Then my mom got real sick,

164
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:56,897
so I moved back to Omaha to take care of her.

165
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:00,361
<i>I wanted to be a surgeon, actually.</i>

166
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:02,785
<i>You know, we might've ended up
working together.</i>

167
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:04,866
<i>You could've been my anesthesiologist!</i>

168
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:07,165
- <i>How about that?</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

169
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:23,723
Oh, my God. No way.

170
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:39,610
Dave?

171
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,776
That's Dave! Dave Johnson!

172
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,402
And Carol!

173
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,538
I heard he was coming. I had no idea!

174
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:50,621
He never struck me as the kind
of guy who'd go get small.

175
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,643
- Hey, everybody.
- Hi.

176
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:13,144
- Hope we're not intruding.
- No.

177
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:15,479
Hey, Andy?

178
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:17,735
Could you get Carol a...

179
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:20,063
Gin and tonic.

180
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:21,648
A gin and tonic.

181
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:24,155
With lime.

182
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:26,110
<i>Well, actually,</i>

183
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:28,037
<i>we weren't planning on coming
at all at first,</i>

184
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:30,831
but then, you know, we started
getting all the emails.

185
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,493
Plus my sister was having a lump removed.

186
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:36,580
She's fine, thank God,
but I still needed to see her.

187
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:38,334
So what's traveling like?

188
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:40,337
How'd you guys get up here from New Mexico?

189
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,127
Gosh, it's great! Yeah.

190
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,804
The airlines are getting
more and more small-friendly.

191
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:46,798
All the seats are first-class.

192
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:49,676
So, after a couple of years in Florida,
we moved out to Vegas.

193
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,348
Yeah, I think that's the last time we talked.

194
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:54,976
Yeah. Well, Vegas wasn't
such a good choice for me,

195
00:16:55,056 --> 00:16:56,102
as it turns out.

196
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:59,186
Got into some real bad habits.
Pretty much hit rock bottom.

197
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:01,938
I'll tell you, any other woman
would've run for the hills.

198
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:05,196
But Carol, man, she's a saint.
She stuck with me.

199
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:07,655
But I really had to come clean
about everything.

200
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:08,953
I mean everything.

201
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:10,780
You know, almost.

202
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:12,870
So the decision to...

203
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:15,955
Well, that's the thing.
We both needed a change.

204
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,129
Hit the reset button. Start all over.

205
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:21,257
Plus, it must feel good to know
you're really making a difference.

206
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:23,546
You mean all that crap
about saving the planet?

207
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:24,627
Yeah.

208
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,384
Downsizing is about saving yourself.

209
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,090
It takes the pressure right off,

210
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:30,300
especially money pressure.

211
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:33,933
I'm just not driven and ambitious
like the rest of my family.

212
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:36,606
But now Carol and I, we live like kings!

213
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:39,647
I'm still living in
the same house I grew up in.

214
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:43,567
Audrey's dying for us to move,
but we're really strapped.

215
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:47,116
I mean, shit, I just finished
paying off my student loans!

216
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:48,863
Yeah, well...

217
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:52,163
Listen, if you ever start
thinking about it seriously,

218
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:54,161
here's my two cents.

219
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:56,747
There's a lot of small communities
cropping up out there,

220
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:57,994
but don't mess around.

221
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,499
Leisureland's where you want to be.

222
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,757
Best houses, best appliances, best doctors.

223
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:04,545
They book all the big concert tours.

224
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:05,797
Got all the great restaurants.

225
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,007
The kids love Cheesecake Factory

226
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,930
and Leisureland's got three of them.

227
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:13,593
And hey, I'm not just saying all this for
the referral credit, just so you know.

228
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,809
I liked little Carol.
She's got a lot on the ball.

229
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:20,978
She's reading books
she's always wanted to read,

230
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:22,230
she's taking Italian.

231
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:25,988
- And she's never been fitter.
- Well, they sure seem happy.

232
00:18:26,147 --> 00:18:28,571
Dave says he's getting
pretty good on the drums.

233
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:30,986
Next year they're taking
the kids out of school

234
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:34,072
to spend six months
at a sister city in Tuscany.

235
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:38,121
Cooking classes, yoga, wine tasting,
the whole nine yards.

236
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:44,875
<i>Hi, Saf, Audrey. It's Milo.</i>

237
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:46,420
<i>Bad news.</i>

238
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,049
<i>Your mortgage application at
First National bounced back.</i>

239
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:51,926
<i>The underwriter didn't like
the income-to-debt ratios,</i>

240
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:53,553
<i>they're a little excessive.</i>

241
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:57,554
<i>I don't know if you guys can come up
with another ten, fifteen percent down?</i>

242
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:59,809
<i>If you could maybe
boost it up a little bit...</i>

243
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:02,813
I bet we'll be able to tell right away
if it's for us or not.

244
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,145
Yeah, so let's not waste a lot of time.

245
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:08,072
Maybe if we get to Santa Fe early,
we can get a massage.

246
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,732
Sounds good to me.

247
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:11,969
Welcome, everybody!

248
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,675
I'm Jeff Lonowski, Senior Product Specialist

249
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:16,883
and happy homeowner
here at Leisureland Estates.

250
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:18,804
You having a good time?

251
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,386
Yeah.

252
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:24,308
Come on, guys. You're a heck
of a lot bigger than I am.

253
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:27,227
Make some noise! Are you having a good time?

254
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:31,314
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

255
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:33,400
That's more like it.

256
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:35,656
So, what do you think of my place?

257
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,404
Pretty nifty?

258
00:20:38,696 --> 00:20:40,369
It's the house of my dreams.

259
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:42,871
Heck, I'd say this is
the house of anybody's dreams!

260
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:44,535
Why, an average guy like me

261
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:46,290
would have to work 20, 30,

262
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,793
maybe 40 years to afford a place like this,

263
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:50,125
if ever!

264
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:53,212
And just wait till you see what's inside.

265
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:04,730
Jeff!

266
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:08,734
You've got to stop inviting guests over
without telling me.

267
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:10,566
Sorry, Laura. I was only...

268
00:21:10,728 --> 00:21:14,574
I mean, I finally just got in the tub
to relax after such a busy day.

269
00:21:14,732 --> 00:21:16,234
Busy doing what, sweetheart?

270
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,613
No end of things.

271
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:19,821
First I took a tennis lesson
and had a massage.

272
00:21:19,904 --> 00:21:20,905
Nice.

273
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:23,366
And then after a gourmet lunch
with the girls,

274
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:25,284
well, we couldn't help
ourselves, so we popped

275
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:27,791
into that new Loget jewelry store downtown.

276
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:31,207
Loget? What's that gonna cost me?

277
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:33,501
Now, Jeff, you hush!

278
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:35,670
I was really good.

279
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:38,722
Just another diamond bracelet.

280
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,886
"Just a diamond bracelet"?
That doesn't sound like you.

281
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:46,976
You're right. I don't like to break up a set,

282
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:49,730
so I got matching diamond earrings

283
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,110
and a matching diamond necklace.

284
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:55,148
All conflict-free and set in platinum.

285
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:56,733
How much, Laura?

286
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:59,238
But, Jeff, they look so good on me,
and you should see...

287
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:00,820
How much, Laura?

288
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:03,831
- Well, Jeff...
- I said, how much?

289
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:05,658
Eighty-three dollars.

290
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:08,206
Eighty-three dollars! Are you crazy?

291
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:11,714
Why, that's practically our food budget
for two whole months!

292
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:52,041
<i>Putting it all together, if you liquidate</i>

293
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:54,590
your current home, cars and other assets

294
00:22:54,832 --> 00:22:56,835
and purchase the Regency-level estate,

295
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:59,921
remember, that's
the 12,000-square-foot-equivalent home

296
00:23:00,004 --> 00:23:02,301
on the 1.5-acre-equivalent lot

297
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:04,679
at a base price of $63,000.

298
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:06,802
Then the health and fitness package,

299
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:09,099
that's $4,500,
you're going to want to get that.

300
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:13,104
It's gym, pool, sauna, steam,
hot tub and a tennis court.

301
00:23:13,267 --> 00:23:15,439
Then the medical procedures for two adults,

302
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:16,611
that's $15,000.

303
00:23:16,979 --> 00:23:19,073
Wait, does insurance cover any of that?

304
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,070
No, but at the Regency level,
you qualify for a substantial discount.

305
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,032
And don't forget the federal tax credit.

306
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:26,200
- Right. Right.
- All right?

307
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:31,252
So, taking a look at your current debt,
your retirement and your other savings,

308
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:35,756
you are at $152,000 in equity.

309
00:23:35,873 --> 00:23:38,171
People, that is a very comfortable number.

310
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,672
"Comfortable"? That doesn't

311
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:41,095
- sound like nearly enough.
- Yeah.

312
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:43,425
No. See, you have to look
at this column, Audrey.

313
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:44,677
Equivalent value.

314
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:47,351
You're solidly inside the Blue Chip zone.

315
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:50,354
In Leisureland, your $152,000

316
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:53,516
translates to $12.5 million.

317
00:23:53,724 --> 00:23:55,567
To live on. For life.

318
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:57,603
I mean, come on!

319
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:03,451
Hold on. If this is such a good thing,
how come you haven't done it?

320
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:05,445
I would do it in a heartbeat!

321
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:08,281
But my husband had a hip replacement,
so he's ineligible.

322
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:10,832
So, what do you think?

323
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:13,163
Would the Regency level be your first choice?

324
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:16,497
Or should I show you something
a little more deluxe?

325
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:22,089
Honey, why don't you just go ahead and pick?

326
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:23,842
I just want you to be happy.

327
00:24:25,756 --> 00:24:28,726
That's a good husband. Take a look at this.

328
00:24:29,385 --> 00:24:31,888
Hey, how much for the hot dog cooker?

329
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:35,307
Four dollars?

330
00:24:35,683 --> 00:24:37,185
I'll give you a dollar.

331
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:38,602
Sold!

332
00:24:38,936 --> 00:24:42,111
Keep up with the exercises,
don't get lazy. Look.

333
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:43,566
I laminated it for you,

334
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:45,526
so you literally have no excuse not to do it.

335
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:46,610
Okay. Thanks, Paul.

336
00:24:46,694 --> 00:24:47,695
- Thanks a lot.
- You bet.

337
00:24:47,778 --> 00:24:50,622
Maybe someday me and my wife will get
small and we'll come down to see you.

338
00:24:50,781 --> 00:24:52,870
Well, I'd love that, but in the meantime...

339
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:54,038
- Okay?
- All right.

340
00:24:54,118 --> 00:24:56,792
Just 15 minutes every night.
It'll change your life.

341
00:24:56,954 --> 00:24:58,831
- Okay. Thanks, Paul.
- See you, Dave!

342
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:03,130
We're here to wish Paul Safranek
farewell as he moves on to Leisureland,

343
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,087
and we wish him nothing but the best.

344
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,922
Good luck to you and Audrey.

345
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:10,142
Thanks, Bob. Thanks, Bob.

346
00:25:16,807 --> 00:25:18,810
And you guys didn't consider Treasure Island

347
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:19,893
out in Palm Desert?

348
00:25:19,977 --> 00:25:21,900
Well, we checked it out, but...

349
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:25,407
I liked it all right, but Audrey thought they
were a little stingy with the amenities,

350
00:25:25,566 --> 00:25:28,115
especially given what they were charging
in monthly maintenance.

351
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:32,661
And I just turned to Paul and said,
"Okay, you win. Let's go for it."

352
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:35,121
We're just gonna miss you so much.

353
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:38,291
Gina, I'm gonna miss you, too.

354
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:41,966
Look, it's not like we're dying. Okay?
We're just relocating.

355
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:45,295
And we'll be back at least
once a year. Maybe more!

356
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:53,469
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi, sweetie.

357
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:57,808
I'm sorry your mom couldn't
bring herself to come,

358
00:25:57,973 --> 00:25:59,436
but she sends her love,

359
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:02,065
and we're expecting you
at the house tomorrow afternoon.

360
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:04,692
Glad you could make it, Larry.

361
00:26:04,772 --> 00:26:07,241
- Hey, Paul.
- What can I get you, Dad?

362
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:11,324
Look, why don't I...
Here, you guys visit, I'll...

363
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:12,488
Beer.

364
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:15,366
- Just any beer.
- Great. Okay, coming up.

365
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:19,537
I wish Mom weren't taking this so hard.

366
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:21,376
Well, you know your mother.

367
00:26:21,622 --> 00:26:25,047
Frankly, I was a little skeptical
about it myself at first.

368
00:26:25,459 --> 00:26:27,382
Say, you remember Jerry Gross?

369
00:26:28,045 --> 00:26:31,640
I called him the other day.
He and Bev retired down there.

370
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:34,559
Did the whole shrinking thing
you kids are doing.

371
00:26:34,885 --> 00:26:37,604
He says they're getting
along just fine. Never better.

372
00:26:38,222 --> 00:26:39,724
He says he feels younger every day

373
00:26:39,807 --> 00:26:42,731
and that a dollar buys
a thousand dollars' worth of stuff.

374
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:46,191
Of course, they need that with
all the medication Bev takes,

375
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:47,818
but yeah.

376
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,864
No, I see the appeal.

377
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:52,614
Apparently, there's zero crime.

378
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:53,991
I keep telling your mother.

379
00:26:54,071 --> 00:26:56,074
Yeah, it's very safe.

380
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,702
We worry.

381
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:04,624
When I was younger, and then I lost it.

382
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:05,833
Hey.

383
00:27:06,542 --> 00:27:08,636
You guys are the ones getting small, right?

384
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:12,924
That's right. My wife and I.

385
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:14,808
Good for you.

386
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:19,892
No offense, but

387
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:23,017
do you think if you're that small,
you should still have

388
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:26,148
all the same rights
as the rest of us normal-sized people?

389
00:27:26,228 --> 00:27:27,775
I mean, like the right to vote?

390
00:27:30,232 --> 00:27:33,077
- Why wouldn't we?
- Well, jeez, let's see...

391
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,782
You're not buying as many products,

392
00:27:34,862 --> 00:27:36,533
you're not paying as much sales tax.

393
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:38,707
Some of you aren't even paying
any income tax.

394
00:27:38,866 --> 00:27:40,329
You're not really participating

395
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:41,536
- in our economy, are you?
- Hey.

396
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:44,042
In fact, you're costing us money, and jobs.

397
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:45,956
Hey! That's enough.

398
00:27:46,582 --> 00:27:48,129
We're just having a good time here.

399
00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:51,053
Hey, I'm just asking a simple
academic question.

400
00:27:51,295 --> 00:27:52,296
You know what?

401
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:53,967
You guys should have
a quarter of the vote at most.

402
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:55,549
That's pretty generous, don't you think?

403
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:56,884
Why don't you have a seat?

404
00:27:56,967 --> 00:27:59,140
- Why don't you take a walk?
- Cool your jets, big guy!

405
00:27:59,303 --> 00:28:01,476
You know what? Maybe
an eighth of a vote, in fact.

406
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:03,515
And you could use a little small, buddy.

407
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:04,817
Yeah, sit down.

408
00:28:06,602 --> 00:28:08,229
Hey! Hey!

409
00:28:08,896 --> 00:28:12,400
Can I get a normal-sized beer
for a normal-sized guy?

410
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:21,348
I keep thinking I forgot something.

411
00:29:58,088 --> 00:29:59,931
Moving to town, are you?

412
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:01,967
How's that?

413
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:04,933
I see you're moving to Leisureland.

414
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:07,307
You look like a nice young couple.

415
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:09,766
Thanks.

416
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:12,027
- Where you from?
- Omaha.

417
00:30:12,436 --> 00:30:13,779
Spokane.

418
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:15,321
Nervous?

419
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,034
Yeah, you know, a little.

420
00:30:19,276 --> 00:30:23,281
Don't be. It's the best thing you'll ever do.

421
00:30:28,744 --> 00:30:30,916
<i>With your permission, I'm going to</i>

422
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:33,590
<i>record your answers
to the following questions.</i>

423
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:35,796
May I begin the recording?

424
00:30:35,876 --> 00:30:37,048
- Sure.
- Yeah.

425
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:42,554
Please state your full legal names.

426
00:30:43,342 --> 00:30:45,436
Audrey Lustig Safranek.

427
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:48,351
Paul Norris Safranek.

428
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:52,025
And do you, Audrey Lustig Safranek,

429
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:55,112
and you, Paul Norris Safranek,

430
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:58,278
understand that,
of your own free will, you will undergo

431
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:01,113
the permanent and
irreversible medical procedure

432
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:03,116
commonly known as "downsizing,"

433
00:31:03,445 --> 00:31:05,367
and that following the procedure,

434
00:31:05,447 --> 00:31:08,201
your bodies will be
approximately 0.0364 percent

435
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:10,411
of their current mass and volume?

436
00:31:11,161 --> 00:31:12,162
Yep.

437
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:14,589
I'm sorry, Paul, I need a yes or no.

438
00:31:15,082 --> 00:31:16,755
- Yes.
- Yes.

439
00:31:17,084 --> 00:31:18,586
Great. Thank you.

440
00:31:19,086 --> 00:31:23,011
And do you give full consent
to Gateway Medical Services

441
00:31:23,173 --> 00:31:26,973
to administer the medical procedure
commonly known as "downsizing"?

442
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,012
- Yes.
- Yes.

443
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:32,065
And do you understand that there exists

444
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:35,649
an approximately one in 225,000 chance

445
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:38,775
that the procedure could result in injury,

446
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:41,233
permanent disability, or death?

447
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:50,792
- Yes.
- Yes.

448
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:52,285
Yes.

449
00:32:06,716 --> 00:32:09,140
Safranek. Paul Safranek?

450
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:10,470
Yes.

451
00:32:18,979 --> 00:32:21,318
- It's actually Safranek.
- Safranek.

452
00:32:21,398 --> 00:32:23,446
- Come with me, sir.
- We're together.

453
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:27,033
Someone will escort you
to the women's facility shortly.

454
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:30,074
You'll be separated
for approximately five hours.

455
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,415
Following the procedure,
you'll be reunited in the recovery room.

456
00:32:34,161 --> 00:32:35,253
Okay.

457
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:39,212
- So, this is it.
- Yeah.

458
00:32:40,584 --> 00:32:42,257
- I'll see you tonight.
- Yeah.

459
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:45,054
I'll see you on the other side.

460
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:49,642
I love you.

461
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:51,807
I love you, too.

462
00:33:49,069 --> 00:33:51,072
Okay, let's get you up here.

463
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:24,433
All clear!

464
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,263
Aye, we got some real fat ones this time.

465
00:38:23,343 --> 00:38:25,095
Hey, how's everybody doing today?

466
00:38:25,178 --> 00:38:26,930
Hey, Miss Joyce! Doin' good. How you doin'?

467
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:30,108
Me, I'm great. Just getting
ready for the weekend.

468
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:20,734
I see you've decided to join us.

469
00:39:21,651 --> 00:39:24,120
Is this... Is it over?

470
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:27,661
Welcome to Leisureland.
Can you tell me your name?

471
00:39:27,991 --> 00:39:30,540
- It's Paul Safranek.
- Okay, good.

472
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:32,371
I bet you're hungry.

473
00:39:40,003 --> 00:39:41,095
Oh, my God.

474
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:44,724
Isn't that cute? People just love that.

475
00:39:45,008 --> 00:39:46,596
I'll bring you a real snack in a moment.

476
00:39:46,676 --> 00:39:47,677
Thanks.

477
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:49,975
I think my wife is supposed
to be here with me.

478
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:52,141
- What's her name?
- Audrey Safranek.

479
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:53,475
Let me see.

480
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:55,855
We do have an Audrey Safranek
scheduled for today,

481
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:58,108
but I don't show her transferred over yet.

482
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:00,820
She's probably just held up
in dental. I'll go check.

483
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:02,571
Okay. Thank you.

484
00:40:08,156 --> 00:40:10,500
Mr. Safranek, you've got a call.

485
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,497
Thank you.

486
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:13,832
Hello?

487
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:17,002
- <i>Paul?</i>
- Audrey. Thank God!

488
00:40:17,332 --> 00:40:18,834
Where are you, honey?

489
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:21,511
<i>Don't be mad at me. Please don't be mad.</i>

490
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:23,512
<i>It's hard enough as it is.</i>

491
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:26,011
What's hard? Wait.
What are you talking about?

492
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:29,516
<i>Paul, they shaved my head!</i>

493
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:32,222
<i>And then they started shaving my eyebrows,</i>

494
00:40:32,305 --> 00:40:33,852
<i>and I just thought,</i>

495
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:35,934
<i>what am I doing?</i>

496
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:38,770
<i>I can't leave my family.
I can't leave my friends.</i>

497
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:41,277
- <i>I'm sorry, Paul, I just can't.</i>
- Where are you?

498
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,114
Are you at the airport?

499
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,620
Don't hate me.

500
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:49,948
Please don't hate me.

501
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:52,284
<i>Okay, okay. Take it easy.</i>

502
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:56,042
Just get in a taxi and come back
and we'll talk about this, okay?

503
00:40:56,371 --> 00:40:59,716
We'll go back to Omaha
and we'll think this through together.

504
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:03,836
Wait...

505
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:06,305
You're not leaving me here?

506
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:10,594
Can't you understand how I feel?
I feel terrible!

507
00:41:10,927 --> 00:41:13,271
I let you down, I feel awful!

508
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,183
But then I realized
I was just doing this because

509
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:18,518
I was trying to make you happy,

510
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:21,191
and I should have been
thinking more about myself.

511
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:24,858
"Thinking about yourself'?
"Thinking about yourself'?

512
00:41:24,941 --> 00:41:27,280
You know you haven't even asked me how I am?

513
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:30,033
<i>Don't yell. Don't yell at me or I'll hang up.</i>

514
00:41:30,113 --> 00:41:34,539
Do you have any idea what
I have been through today?

515
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:37,621
Audrey, if you don't
come back here right now...

516
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:40,499
And see you all small?

517
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:42,926
I'm upset enough already!

518
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:46,338
You're upset? You're upset?

519
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:49,428
I'm the one who's five fucking inches tall!

520
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:53,936
I was sure sorry to hear
Mrs. Safranek couldn't make it today.

521
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:56,431
- Safranek.
- Safranek.

522
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:58,186
Well, it's not a half-bad idea

523
00:41:58,266 --> 00:42:00,439
to scout things out and get
everything ready for her.

524
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:09,656
The net blocks a lot of UV rays,

525
00:42:09,736 --> 00:42:11,784
but you still might want to put your hat on.

526
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:16,084
And any time you want to go somewhere,
you just hop in one of these bad boys.

527
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:19,044
And if they're in short supply,
well, you can always share.

528
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:20,246
It's fun to share.

529
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:22,047
I know I've met some super people that way.

530
00:42:22,457 --> 00:42:23,549
Just super!

531
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:37,184
Yeah. Isn't that something?

532
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:50,860
Over to your right there,
in that big white oval building,

533
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:52,612
is one of our seven sports centers.

534
00:42:52,862 --> 00:42:53,989
That's the one that houses

535
00:42:54,072 --> 00:42:56,536
the largest indoor skiing facility
in the world.

536
00:42:56,616 --> 00:42:58,710
You know, relatively speaking.

537
00:42:58,868 --> 00:43:00,962
And up ahead we have Lake Chester.

538
00:43:33,528 --> 00:43:34,871
Look familiar?

539
00:43:35,196 --> 00:43:38,120
The Barrington. My sister's
got one. She loves it!

540
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:41,453
Well, sir, here is the key to your kingdom.

541
00:43:42,203 --> 00:43:43,830
Welcome to the good life.

542
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:49,756
They stock the kitchen with standard items,

543
00:43:49,836 --> 00:43:51,759
but one thing I should
warn you about is the dairy.

544
00:43:51,921 --> 00:43:55,174
Takes a while for your stomach to adjust
to the milk and cheese, so go easy on it.

545
00:43:55,258 --> 00:43:56,760
Something about bacteria.

546
00:43:56,843 --> 00:43:58,389
And be careful about the hot water.

547
00:43:58,469 --> 00:43:59,766
It's on one central system

548
00:43:59,846 --> 00:44:01,348
and they got that cranked really high.

549
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:03,353
Surprised they haven't had a lawsuit yet.

550
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:05,192
But you didn't hear that from me!

551
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:07,361
Thanks, Matt.

552
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:09,272
You're a nice guy.

553
00:44:12,567 --> 00:44:13,910
And, Paul?

554
00:44:15,111 --> 00:44:16,738
Thanks for helping the planet.

555
00:45:31,646 --> 00:45:32,738
Fuck!

556
00:45:47,453 --> 00:45:48,671
Safranek?

557
00:45:51,916 --> 00:45:53,168
That's me.

558
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:56,094
Okay!

559
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:14,443
<i>And now to the United States,
where for many years,</i>

560
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:16,944
<i>both the Department of Homeland Security</i>

561
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:19,448
<i>and the Immigration
and Naturalization Service</i>

562
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:21,282
<i>have been warning about the ease</i>

563
00:46:21,362 --> 00:46:23,205
<i>with which downsized people,</i>

564
00:46:23,364 --> 00:46:26,037
<i>from illegal immigrants
to potential terrorists,</i>

565
00:46:26,117 --> 00:46:27,744
<i>could penetrate U.S. borders.</i>

566
00:46:28,244 --> 00:46:30,666
<i>Last week's discovery in Eugene, Oregon,</i>

567
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:33,215
<i>provided new evidence to support that claim.</i>

568
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:36,006
<i>Brian Fakler brings us up to date.</i>

569
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:40,256
<i>This Target is just one of thousands
of big box stores around the country</i>

570
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:42,884
<i>that import almost a million tons
of goods weekly,</i>

571
00:46:42,967 --> 00:46:44,263
<i>most of it from Asia.</i>

572
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:47,518
<i>Last week, workers here in Eugene
opened a suspicious TV box</i>

573
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:51,184
<i>and discovered 17 downsized
stowaways from Vietnam,</i>

574
00:46:51,267 --> 00:46:52,813
<i>14 of them already dead,</i>

575
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:56,272
<i>two more dying hours later
at a local hospital.</i>

576
00:46:56,689 --> 00:47:00,029
<i>On Friday, the lone survivor,
a woman named Ngoc Lan Tran,</i>

577
00:47:00,109 --> 00:47:03,363
<i>was transferred to a hospital
at Leisureland Estates in New Mexico,</i>

578
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:06,624
<i>widely considered the country's
top medical center for the small.</i>

579
00:47:06,866 --> 00:47:09,870
<i>Doctors were forced to amputate
a portion of an infected leg,</i>

580
00:47:10,036 --> 00:47:12,915
<i>and today her condition
is described as fair but stable.</i>

581
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,168
<i>According to a statement</i>

582
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:16,091
<i>from the Department of Homeland Security,</i>

583
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:20,088
<i>Miss Tran claims to have been jailed
for her political and environmental activism</i>

584
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:23,758
<i>and was miniaturized against her will
in a Vietnamese prison facility.</i>

585
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:26,678
<i>If true, this would bolster
claims by human rights groups</i>

586
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:29,141
<i>that repressive governments around the world</i>

587
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:31,849
<i>are forcibly downsizing
political undesirables.</i>

588
00:47:40,441 --> 00:47:43,320
So, do we need to review
any of the terms of the settlement?

589
00:47:43,778 --> 00:47:44,779
No.

590
00:47:45,029 --> 00:47:46,702
It's all pretty clear.

591
00:47:47,031 --> 00:47:49,534
I really wish you'd taken her first offer.

592
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:51,122
I know.

593
00:47:51,202 --> 00:47:53,705
All right, well, if you could
just step back a little.

594
00:47:53,788 --> 00:47:55,085
Don't want you to get hurt.

595
00:48:14,350 --> 00:48:15,943
As large as you can, please.

596
00:48:22,191 --> 00:48:23,693
Nice weather down here.

597
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:26,863
Turned real cold back in Omaha.

598
00:48:29,073 --> 00:48:30,416
Wind chill.

599
00:49:16,245 --> 00:49:17,246
Hey, Paul.

600
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:18,918
Thanks, man. You were right.

601
00:49:18,998 --> 00:49:20,841
Raising my monitor really did the trick.

602
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,464
My neck feels better, there's
no more tingling in my arm.

603
00:49:23,544 --> 00:49:24,762
I would have never made the connection.

604
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,923
That's great. I'm really glad I could help.

605
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:33,182
Thank you for calling Lands' End.
My name is Paul.

606
00:49:33,262 --> 00:49:34,889
How can I help you today?

607
00:49:59,955 --> 00:50:01,207
Hi, Carol.

608
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:15,846
Hey, pal.

609
00:50:16,764 --> 00:50:18,767
Why the long face?

610
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:21,352
Look around you, buddy. Life is good!

611
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:24,530
I made a mistake, Dave.

612
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:25,985
Biggest mistake of my life.

613
00:50:26,065 --> 00:50:27,692
I should've stayed where I was.

614
00:50:27,775 --> 00:50:28,776
Hey, hey, hey.

615
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:30,823
Look, I know divorce can put
a pretty big dent

616
00:50:30,903 --> 00:50:32,121
in anyone's self-esteem.

617
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:34,782
And what Audrey did to you
was beyond the pale.

618
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:36,284
I mean, I hate her.

619
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:37,619
I barely know her.

620
00:50:37,785 --> 00:50:40,083
You may not hate her, but I hate her guts.

621
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:42,957
You? You just got to get back
in the saddle, that's all.

622
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,508
Yeah, maybe someday.

623
00:50:45,626 --> 00:50:47,094
If you want my advice,

624
00:50:47,419 --> 00:50:49,342
single moms is the way to go.

625
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:52,759
They got the whole kid thing out of their
system, and they just want to party.

626
00:50:52,967 --> 00:50:53,968
No, that's okay.

627
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:57,476
And if you don't want an emotional connection,
which is understandable, you can just...

628
00:50:57,638 --> 00:51:01,643
Well, we have all sorts of ways you can have
a good time down here, no strings attached.

629
00:51:01,976 --> 00:51:02,977
Just put it on the old credit card.

630
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:04,523
No, I'm good. Really.

631
00:51:04,603 --> 00:51:05,649
Okay, yeah.

632
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:08,357
In fact, I started seeing someone.

633
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:09,487
Yeah?

634
00:51:09,984 --> 00:51:11,486
Single mom, actually.

635
00:51:12,987 --> 00:51:15,081
Now we're talking! Good for you.

636
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:24,919
Paul, this is so good.

637
00:51:24,999 --> 00:51:26,000
Thanks.

638
00:51:28,252 --> 00:51:31,756
The recipe called for chervil,
but you can't get chervil here yet.

639
00:51:32,006 --> 00:51:33,553
So I used dill.

640
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:37,474
Well, whatever it is, it's super yummy.

641
00:51:39,263 --> 00:51:40,890
It's the little things, you know?

642
00:51:41,390 --> 00:51:46,024
I mean, except for there being no birds or
insects, you'd think we're in the normal world.

643
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:49,190
And then something happens,
and you realize we're not.

644
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:52,110
Not that substituting dill for chervil
is that big a thing,

645
00:51:52,192 --> 00:51:53,444
but you know what I mean.

646
00:51:53,861 --> 00:51:57,786
Like last month, my parents came down
to visit Jonah and me.

647
00:51:58,157 --> 00:52:00,955
And it's this whole production
with the carrying boxes

648
00:52:01,035 --> 00:52:02,581
and, of course, Jonah gets freaked out

649
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:05,540
by Grandma and Grandpa
being so huge and scary.

650
00:52:06,165 --> 00:52:08,379
One night they took us out
for dinner at Fleming's.

651
00:52:08,459 --> 00:52:09,836
You know, real nice.

652
00:52:10,169 --> 00:52:15,016
And Jonah and I are sitting on the table
in those special seats,

653
00:52:15,507 --> 00:52:17,931
and the big people
wouldn't stop staring at us.

654
00:52:18,177 --> 00:52:20,849
Plus, the restaurant brags about
how small people are welcome,

655
00:52:20,929 --> 00:52:22,772
then they charge a huge minimum!

656
00:52:23,015 --> 00:52:24,311
They should charge big people extra.

657
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:26,105
They're the ones dragging down the world.

658
00:52:26,185 --> 00:52:28,609
I know. Big people look at us
like we're freaks.

659
00:52:28,771 --> 00:52:30,193
They're the freaks!

660
00:52:30,689 --> 00:52:32,817
Did you hear about
all that gas being released

661
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:34,447
in Antarctica from the ice?

662
00:52:34,610 --> 00:52:35,702
The methane?

663
00:52:35,861 --> 00:52:38,285
I haven't really been following the news
that much lately.

664
00:52:38,614 --> 00:52:40,116
Apparently, it's a big deal.

665
00:52:40,282 --> 00:52:42,246
Scientists are saying the more the ice melts,

666
00:52:42,326 --> 00:52:43,327
the more methane comes out,

667
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:45,253
making more ice melt.

668
00:52:45,579 --> 00:52:47,957
Apparently, we're already
way beyond the tipping...

669
00:52:51,502 --> 00:52:53,175
It's my upstairs neighbor.

670
00:52:53,504 --> 00:52:54,631
It's the strangest thing.

671
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:56,181
There wasn't a peep for months.

672
00:52:56,340 --> 00:53:01,187
I don't even think he was here. And then
suddenly it's party, party, party.

673
00:53:01,345 --> 00:53:03,439
I had to call security the other night.

674
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:12,443
Dušan!

675
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:14,904
Hey, Dušan!

676
00:53:16,110 --> 00:53:17,282
Dušan!

677
00:53:17,736 --> 00:53:18,737
Yes?

678
00:53:18,821 --> 00:53:20,284
You mind turning down the music?

679
00:53:20,364 --> 00:53:22,992
I'm trying to have a quiet evening down here.

680
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:28,748
- Hello, my friend.
- Hello, Dušan.

681
00:53:29,498 --> 00:53:30,920
May I come in?

682
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:32,751
Certainly.

683
00:53:36,922 --> 00:53:39,346
So, listen, Pete...

684
00:53:39,508 --> 00:53:40,680
Paul.

685
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:43,854
- Paul. And Kristen.
- Paul.

686
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:46,182
- Hello, Kristen.
- Hi.

687
00:53:46,348 --> 00:53:49,852
I'm sorry I'm disturbing
your nice little dinner.

688
00:53:50,728 --> 00:53:51,820
Listen...

689
00:53:52,187 --> 00:53:54,360
As I was saying, Paul,

690
00:53:54,606 --> 00:53:58,156
I'm having one more, you know,
little party at my place tonight.

691
00:53:58,444 --> 00:54:00,321
Not big like last time. Very small.

692
00:54:00,404 --> 00:54:02,953
Just a few close friends.

693
00:54:03,532 --> 00:54:04,624
No!

694
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:07,040
Is that a rose?

695
00:54:07,286 --> 00:54:09,254
- Yeah.
- A real rose?

696
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:12,667
Where'd you get a real rose?

697
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:16,428
It's a new store. Full-Sized Flower Mart.

698
00:54:17,421 --> 00:54:19,173
How much they charge you for this?

699
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:21,850
Dušan! Dušan!

700
00:54:36,774 --> 00:54:37,946
Anyway,

701
00:54:38,692 --> 00:54:40,035
as I was saying,

702
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:43,955
Paul, if tonight noise disturbs you,
just come upstairs, talk to me.

703
00:54:44,198 --> 00:54:47,452
Don't make big show like last time,
yelling like crazy man.

704
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:50,291
We're neighbors. Neighbors are friends.

705
00:54:50,496 --> 00:54:52,999
What's better even, come to the party.

706
00:54:53,165 --> 00:54:57,090
Thanks, but like I said,
we just want to have a quiet dinner.

707
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:59,923
Just try to keep it down, okay?

708
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:03,217
Yes, darling. Of course.

709
00:55:11,183 --> 00:55:13,527
Thanks for a really nice time.

710
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:15,479
Plus the cooking and all.

711
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:17,986
Sorry I have to leave so early,
but, you know, the sitter.

712
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:20,534
Yeah! Yeah, no, I...

713
00:55:25,781 --> 00:55:27,283
Up one floor.

714
00:55:27,658 --> 00:55:28,785
Yeah, one more.

715
00:55:35,707 --> 00:55:36,879
Anyway...

716
00:55:37,209 --> 00:55:40,133
I was hoping Sunday we could bring Jonah.

717
00:55:40,879 --> 00:55:42,552
I'd love to meet him.

718
00:55:42,881 --> 00:55:44,224
Yeah. Maybe.

719
00:56:00,566 --> 00:56:02,489
- Is something wrong?
- No.

720
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:06,196
You're a wonderful guy, Paul,

721
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:08,874
and I really enjoy hanging out with you.

722
00:56:11,243 --> 00:56:13,832
But if I'm honest about how I'm feeling,

723
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:16,126
it might be too soon for me.

724
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:17,419
It's fine, I get it.

725
00:56:17,499 --> 00:56:19,126
- No...
- I get it. No, it's fine.

726
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:21,883
I just mean if we're bringing Jonah into it.

727
00:56:22,254 --> 00:56:23,722
Have a nice night.

728
00:56:23,881 --> 00:56:24,882
No...

729
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:26,557
Paul!

730
00:56:50,991 --> 00:56:52,334
A rose!

731
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:13,263
Paul!

732
00:57:14,973 --> 00:57:16,316
You come!

733
00:57:17,059 --> 00:57:18,856
And you bring the rose.

734
00:57:18,936 --> 00:57:20,688
As a peace offering.

735
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:22,776
Look, everyone!

736
00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:26,196
This is Paul, my neighbor,
and look at what he brings me.

737
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:27,653
A real fucking rose!

738
00:57:29,488 --> 00:57:32,116
Do you think any of these
other ungrateful sons of bitches

739
00:57:32,199 --> 00:57:33,997
think to bring something to Dušan?

740
00:57:34,326 --> 00:57:37,045
No. You're the only one. I like you.

741
00:57:38,330 --> 00:57:41,004
Look, I know I said it's only a little party,

742
00:57:41,166 --> 00:57:44,420
but I make two, three phone calls to
very close friends, look what happens.

743
00:57:44,503 --> 00:57:46,255
Everybody comes!

744
00:57:46,338 --> 00:57:49,888
There's nothing else to do
in this fucking city after 10:00.

745
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:52,970
Now, this I do not understand.

746
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:56,565
It's not as if so many people
have work in the morning.

747
00:57:56,723 --> 00:57:59,602
This is the worst trait about small people.

748
00:57:59,685 --> 00:58:00,812
They're lazy.

749
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:03,067
Not all. Not all. But lazy.

750
00:58:03,397 --> 00:58:06,901
Like this lazy son of a bitch.

751
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:08,360
Konrad.

752
00:58:09,069 --> 00:58:10,908
What's that you're saying about me?

753
00:58:10,988 --> 00:58:12,490
What lies are you telling?

754
00:58:12,656 --> 00:58:15,000
Just that in small world
no one wants to work!

755
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:16,501
What did you expect?

756
00:58:16,743 --> 00:58:19,541
That's the wonderful thing
about becoming small.

757
00:58:19,621 --> 00:58:21,460
Because you're immediately rich.

758
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:25,545
Unless you're very poor.
Then you're just small.

759
00:58:26,461 --> 00:58:27,804
Konrad is sea captain.

760
00:58:29,089 --> 00:58:31,513
Never more than ten meters
away from his boat.

761
00:58:32,634 --> 00:58:34,477
I do like my boat.

762
00:58:36,138 --> 00:58:39,483
There she is. <i>Sonja,</i> my beauty.

763
00:58:40,017 --> 00:58:43,692
You see, I'm from many generations,

764
00:58:43,937 --> 00:58:47,908
all the way back to my grandfathers,
my father, all sea captains.

765
00:58:49,401 --> 00:58:51,740
So, what brings you to Leisureland?

766
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:52,821
Dušan.

767
00:58:53,071 --> 00:58:55,745
He even convinced me to become small.

768
00:58:55,907 --> 00:58:59,411
Mostly for the women and the parties.

769
00:58:59,745 --> 00:59:01,042
And, frankly,

770
00:59:01,455 --> 00:59:03,207
my wife had all the money.

771
00:59:03,623 --> 00:59:06,798
And after she left,
things became a bit tricky.

772
00:59:07,085 --> 00:59:08,428
I can relate.

773
00:59:08,879 --> 00:59:12,554
It's quite wonderful
to be small, don't you think?

774
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:15,553
I'd say it has its pluses and minuses.

775
00:59:16,011 --> 00:59:18,139
Next week I'll be in the Seychelles.

776
00:59:18,472 --> 00:59:20,018
And two weeks after that,

777
00:59:20,098 --> 00:59:23,728
I'll be sailing with friends
for a month on Lake Titicaca.

778
00:59:23,894 --> 00:59:27,069
Can you believe I've never
been to Lake Titicaca?

779
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:29,650
And how does the boat get
from place to place?

780
00:59:29,733 --> 00:59:31,155
I mean, you can't sail it.

781
00:59:31,651 --> 00:59:33,824
FedEx, my dear boy.

782
00:59:34,154 --> 00:59:36,999
<i>Sonja</i> travels faster than I do!

783
00:59:56,718 --> 00:59:59,141
How'd you get a tiny harpsichord down here?

784
00:59:59,221 --> 01:00:01,019
I didn't. I had to have it made.

785
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:09,732
Who is that?

786
01:00:09,815 --> 01:00:11,488
- Who's that?
- Yeah.

787
01:00:11,733 --> 01:00:13,235
That's Little Ronni.

788
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:14,782
That's Little Ronni?

789
01:00:14,903 --> 01:00:17,242
The first small baby ever born,
back in Norway.

790
01:00:17,322 --> 01:00:19,911
Holy shit, that's Little Ronni!

791
01:00:19,991 --> 01:00:21,743
Yeah. You should go talk to him.

792
01:00:26,706 --> 01:00:29,209
Sorry... Sorry, excuse me.

793
01:00:29,709 --> 01:00:31,923
Is it true you're Little Ronni?

794
01:00:32,003 --> 01:00:33,926
Well, maybe not so little anymore,

795
01:00:34,381 --> 01:00:35,553
but, yeah, that's me.

796
01:00:37,425 --> 01:00:39,769
- Would it be cool to get a selfie?
- Yeah, man. Get in here.

797
01:00:39,928 --> 01:00:40,929
Awesome. Thank you so much.

798
01:00:41,012 --> 01:00:43,140
I really appreciate it. Thank you.

799
01:01:32,647 --> 01:01:34,240
Thank you, so are you.

800
01:01:46,411 --> 01:01:47,788
What is that?

801
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:56,630
No, I need to know. I have allergies.

802
01:02:01,092 --> 01:02:02,594
Wait! Wait.

803
01:02:05,847 --> 01:02:06,939
Okay.

804
01:03:26,386 --> 01:03:28,559
I'm gonna take off my shoes.

805
01:04:20,523 --> 01:04:22,366
Having fun?

806
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:03,984
Enough with the fucking doorbell.

807
01:05:05,819 --> 01:05:07,157
Good morning, Mr. Dušan.

808
01:05:07,237 --> 01:05:09,080
We come clean for you.

809
01:05:30,301 --> 01:05:32,725
<i>So you had fun last night, yeah?</i>

810
01:05:33,555 --> 01:05:37,401
You didn't know you were so lucky
to have exciting neighbors such as me.

811
01:05:37,892 --> 01:05:39,981
Well, I've never been to a party like that.

812
01:05:40,061 --> 01:05:42,150
There were so many Europeans.

813
01:05:42,230 --> 01:05:45,695
Did you know Little Ronni was here?
I mean, he is historic!

814
01:05:45,775 --> 01:05:47,277
And boring.

815
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:49,074
Good-looking dumb Norwegian guy

816
01:05:49,154 --> 01:05:51,532
goes around the world
having sex with everyone.

817
01:05:51,698 --> 01:05:53,701
Women, men, hermaphrodites,

818
01:05:53,867 --> 01:05:56,040
dogs, goats, monkeys.

819
01:05:56,202 --> 01:05:58,917
He'll be the first small baby
to die of syphilis.

820
01:05:58,997 --> 01:06:01,500
But, yeah, okay, historic.

821
01:06:02,125 --> 01:06:03,421
Well, apparently, he still lives

822
01:06:03,501 --> 01:06:05,673
in the original colony,
you know, over in Norway.

823
01:06:05,753 --> 01:06:07,130
I've always wanted to see that.

824
01:06:07,464 --> 01:06:08,807
It's all right.

825
01:06:09,716 --> 01:06:10,808
You've been there?

826
01:06:11,342 --> 01:06:13,436
Yeah. I go once or twice a year.

827
01:06:13,928 --> 01:06:16,431
Konrad, too. We make business there.

828
01:06:16,681 --> 01:06:18,103
Very good business.

829
01:06:18,308 --> 01:06:19,771
Must be something to see.

830
01:06:19,851 --> 01:06:21,979
You know you can't even get
pictures of it online?

831
01:06:22,270 --> 01:06:26,946
Yes, my friend. The world
is filled with things to see.

832
01:06:27,859 --> 01:06:29,987
I don't know you, Paul, but I like you.

833
01:06:30,069 --> 01:06:31,116
I like you very much.

834
01:06:31,279 --> 01:06:32,781
And my advice is,

835
01:06:33,031 --> 01:06:37,878
get out of this disgusting little
fucking apartment and open your eyes.

836
01:06:38,161 --> 01:06:39,663
Don't be so American.

837
01:06:40,121 --> 01:06:41,459
You're nice guy, Paul.

838
01:06:41,539 --> 01:06:43,667
But you're a little bit pathetic guy.

839
01:06:44,083 --> 01:06:46,131
Last night you dance, you laugh,

840
01:06:46,211 --> 01:06:48,088
but inside you cry.

841
01:06:50,256 --> 01:06:51,974
Who are you to talk to me that way?

842
01:06:53,593 --> 01:06:55,515
I'm Dušan Mirkovic, your neighbor.

843
01:06:55,595 --> 01:06:56,766
Neighbors are friends.

844
01:06:56,846 --> 01:06:58,689
Friends tell friends the truth.

845
01:06:59,682 --> 01:07:02,185
Okay, maybe sometimes
I'm a little bit asshole,

846
01:07:02,352 --> 01:07:04,149
but the world needs assholes.

847
01:07:04,229 --> 01:07:06,357
Otherwise where would shit go out?

848
01:07:07,649 --> 01:07:09,117
Dušan, bye.

849
01:07:09,526 --> 01:07:10,618
Thank you.

850
01:07:16,449 --> 01:07:18,952
When I think of big people becoming small,

851
01:07:19,035 --> 01:07:20,537
all the new small cities in the world,

852
01:07:20,620 --> 01:07:22,167
I see opportunity.

853
01:07:22,664 --> 01:07:24,758
I ask myself, "Dušan,

854
01:07:25,250 --> 01:07:27,839
"why do people, they want to become small?"

855
01:07:27,919 --> 01:07:30,388
To help the environment? Please!

856
01:07:30,713 --> 01:07:34,764
They become small to have the things
which until now were only for the rich.

857
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:38,055
Which, by the way,
is the genius of the concept.

858
01:07:38,388 --> 01:07:40,732
So I say to my brother, Srdan...

859
01:07:41,182 --> 01:07:42,775
I work with my brother.

860
01:07:42,934 --> 01:07:44,186
He's still big.

861
01:07:44,269 --> 01:07:45,691
My wife, too, by the way.

862
01:07:46,479 --> 01:07:50,234
I say, "Why not bring very special items,

863
01:07:50,608 --> 01:07:53,612
"luxury items, to the small consumer?"

864
01:07:53,695 --> 01:07:56,619
The things that nobody else
is thinking to bring.

865
01:07:57,532 --> 01:07:58,620
Such as?

866
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:03,877
Well, Cohiba Espléndido. Cuba.
Best cigar in the world.

867
01:08:04,289 --> 01:08:06,461
How much you pay for this when you're big?

868
01:08:06,541 --> 01:08:08,339
45, 50 dollars?

869
01:08:08,751 --> 01:08:12,096
When you're small, I sell you
this cigar for one dollar.

870
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:17,181
And from this one Cohiba,
we make about 2,000 cigars.

871
01:08:17,468 --> 01:08:20,438
Okay, maybe they're not
actually made in Cuba.

872
01:08:20,722 --> 01:08:24,727
Maybe they're rolled by little Albanians
in Bujanovac, but who cares?

873
01:08:24,976 --> 01:08:26,649
And this is just one thing.

874
01:08:26,853 --> 01:08:29,402
There's perfume and cologne,

875
01:08:29,647 --> 01:08:33,493
brandy, port, Calvados, truffles, caviar.

876
01:08:33,818 --> 01:08:35,445
Is all that legal?

877
01:08:36,154 --> 01:08:39,203
Baby, this is Wild West.

878
01:08:39,532 --> 01:08:40,954
Who has time chasing after

879
01:08:41,034 --> 01:08:43,913
some fucking Serbian guy five inches tall

880
01:08:43,995 --> 01:08:45,872
over a few cigars and some wine?

881
01:08:46,664 --> 01:08:50,129
My brother and I
are now in seven small cities

882
01:08:50,209 --> 01:08:52,507
around the world. Seven!

883
01:08:53,463 --> 01:08:54,634
Paul, listen.

884
01:08:54,714 --> 01:08:56,637
Anything you want, I can get for you.

885
01:08:56,924 --> 01:08:58,263
Anything, anytime.

886
01:08:58,343 --> 01:08:59,686
Excuse me a minute.

887
01:09:13,816 --> 01:09:14,817
Hello.

888
01:09:18,112 --> 01:09:19,705
Can I talk to you for a minute?

889
01:09:23,284 --> 01:09:25,787
"Na-pro-sien." What this do?

890
01:09:33,836 --> 01:09:36,840
Naproxen. It's an anti-inflammatory.

891
01:09:37,090 --> 01:09:39,639
It's for pain and swelling.

892
01:09:43,971 --> 01:09:46,315
And this one? What this one do?

893
01:09:47,308 --> 01:09:50,278
Well, Vicodin. That's also a painkiller.

894
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:53,526
But you want to be really
careful with that one.

895
01:09:53,606 --> 01:09:55,528
Painkiller? Painkiller good.

896
01:09:55,608 --> 01:09:58,578
Listen. This is not my apartment,

897
01:09:59,153 --> 01:10:01,075
and I'm sure you're probably
in a lot of pain,

898
01:10:01,155 --> 01:10:03,328
but you shouldn't steal pills.

899
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:05,202
I no steal.

900
01:10:05,284 --> 01:10:06,661
They too old, no good.

901
01:10:06,744 --> 01:10:09,623
Mr. Dušan, he say me okay I take away thing.

902
01:10:10,081 --> 01:10:12,084
Pill for sick friend.

903
01:10:19,590 --> 01:10:22,435
Okay. I finish now. Bathroom clean.

904
01:10:25,596 --> 01:10:27,769
Well, whatever's wrong with your "friend,"

905
01:10:27,849 --> 01:10:30,603
I can see that you have
a really, really bad prosthetic foot.

906
01:10:30,685 --> 01:10:33,188
I'm sure it's causing you pain
in your right hip and knee,

907
01:10:33,271 --> 01:10:35,615
probably your other knee, your lower back.

908
01:10:36,858 --> 01:10:39,737
How you know these thing? You a doctor?

909
01:10:40,278 --> 01:10:41,780
Occupational therapist.

910
01:10:43,489 --> 01:10:45,992
Wait a minute. I know you.

911
01:10:47,577 --> 01:10:48,578
You're the... Oh, my God!

912
01:10:49,036 --> 01:10:50,913
You're that woman from a couple years ago,

913
01:10:50,997 --> 01:10:52,124
the dissident,

914
01:10:52,206 --> 01:10:55,085
from Thailand or something? What's your name?

915
01:10:55,835 --> 01:10:57,838
Tran Ngoc Lan. Vietnam.

916
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:01,260
Tran Ngoc Lan from Vietnam.
Yes, that's right!

917
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:04,719
And I remember that you lost
your leg below the knee.

918
01:11:04,802 --> 01:11:06,600
That's... That's you.

919
01:11:12,143 --> 01:11:13,356
Dušan...

920
01:11:13,436 --> 01:11:15,780
Hey, do you know who this is here?

921
01:11:15,938 --> 01:11:18,111
Of course. The famous Ngoc Lan Tran.

922
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:20,277
Dramatic escape from Vietnamese prison,

923
01:11:20,359 --> 01:11:23,283
almost died so now she can clean my house.

924
01:11:24,197 --> 01:11:27,246
America. Big land of opportunity!

925
01:11:32,914 --> 01:11:34,917
Push up. Push again. Push, push, push.

926
01:11:34,999 --> 01:11:37,423
Okay, that's it. Now take your heel
back towards you.

927
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:39,428
Even harder if you can.

928
01:11:39,587 --> 01:11:40,759
Even... Yeah.

929
01:11:41,088 --> 01:11:42,089
Yeah.

930
01:11:42,590 --> 01:11:44,217
Put your hand right here.

931
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:45,301
Feel that, okay?

932
01:11:45,384 --> 01:11:46,806
Feel that crunching? You hear it?

933
01:11:46,886 --> 01:11:50,641
That's arthritis. That's already pretty bad.

934
01:11:51,015 --> 01:11:52,016
Paul?

935
01:11:52,475 --> 01:11:54,102
You're full of surprises.

936
01:11:54,185 --> 01:11:57,483
You can do this, but you work
shit job answering phones?

937
01:11:57,563 --> 01:11:59,610
When I moved down here,
I didn't think I'd be working,

938
01:11:59,690 --> 01:12:01,112
so I let my license expire,

939
01:12:01,192 --> 01:12:03,781
and now I'd have to get it
in a whole other state.

940
01:12:03,861 --> 01:12:04,988
It's a boring story.

941
01:12:07,657 --> 01:12:09,159
I hate to say it,

942
01:12:09,242 --> 01:12:12,039
but if you don't do something pretty soon,
you're going to need a new knee.

943
01:12:12,119 --> 01:12:13,996
Maybe even a new hip.

944
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:16,208
You've got to go to
a specialist as soon as you can

945
01:12:16,290 --> 01:12:17,417
and get a whole new foot.

946
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:18,592
In the meantime,

947
01:12:18,709 --> 01:12:21,212
I could make some adjustments
on the existing prosthetic

948
01:12:21,295 --> 01:12:23,719
and maybe give you some pointers
on how to walk better.

949
01:12:23,881 --> 01:12:26,885
I just hate to see you needlessly suffer
after all you've been through.

950
01:12:27,051 --> 01:12:29,554
Okay. I finish work, you come with me.

951
01:12:29,929 --> 01:12:32,102
No, I could get my tools.
I can do it right here.

952
01:12:32,390 --> 01:12:35,644
No. I say you before.
My friend sick, need pill.

953
01:12:35,810 --> 01:12:38,188
You come with me my house, help her.

954
01:12:38,437 --> 01:12:39,859
You help her.

955
01:12:40,231 --> 01:12:42,074
I don't think I was clear.

956
01:12:42,233 --> 01:12:44,781
I can help you with this,
but I'm not a doctor,

957
01:12:44,861 --> 01:12:46,488
so your friend, whatever's wrong with her,

958
01:12:46,571 --> 01:12:48,244
she's got to go to a clinic or a hospital.

959
01:12:48,406 --> 01:12:49,533
No! Clinic no good.

960
01:12:49,615 --> 01:12:51,492
I bring her clinic, wait too long time.

961
01:12:51,576 --> 01:12:54,921
Stupid doctor say no help for her.
No do nothing!

962
01:12:55,037 --> 01:12:58,792
He no good stupid doctor
in big world, now he small.

963
01:12:59,250 --> 01:13:00,752
You come with me.

964
01:13:01,377 --> 01:13:03,050
You come with me now.

965
01:13:07,174 --> 01:13:08,266
Come.

966
01:13:25,610 --> 01:13:28,659
- You live near here?
- No, still far.

967
01:13:30,072 --> 01:13:32,075
Maybe we should grab a car.

968
01:13:32,909 --> 01:13:35,082
No need car. Take bus.

969
01:13:47,882 --> 01:13:49,725
If you don't mind my asking,

970
01:13:49,884 --> 01:13:51,761
you were so famous a couple years ago.

971
01:13:51,844 --> 01:13:53,596
I mean, everybody was talking about you.

972
01:13:53,930 --> 01:13:57,935
I just would've thought you would be
giving speeches or writing books.

973
01:13:58,309 --> 01:14:00,562
How'd you wind up cleaning houses?

974
01:14:00,895 --> 01:14:02,397
Need money for live.

975
01:14:02,980 --> 01:14:05,653
After TV box, I stay hospital so long time.

976
01:14:05,733 --> 01:14:06,905
Almost die.

977
01:14:07,193 --> 01:14:09,991
Then three host family. But too much problem.

978
01:14:10,071 --> 01:14:11,414
Leisureland people too selfish.

979
01:14:11,822 --> 01:14:14,917
Better I live only me, work job,
make money. Easy.

980
01:15:36,198 --> 01:15:38,542
Hey! You! Come!

981
01:15:39,326 --> 01:15:40,418
Come!

982
01:16:43,516 --> 01:16:44,517
You!

983
01:16:44,892 --> 01:16:47,566
Come on! No time for baby dream.

984
01:16:50,397 --> 01:16:52,319
May I ask how high we're going?

985
01:16:52,399 --> 01:16:54,242
- Seven floor.
- Seven?

986
01:16:54,401 --> 01:16:57,496
- Can we use the elevator?
- No elevator.

987
01:17:26,767 --> 01:17:28,110
Take the shoe.

988
01:17:34,024 --> 01:17:35,492
<i>Hola,</i> Gladys.

989
01:17:39,864 --> 01:17:42,203
This lady Gladys. Gladys my friend.

990
01:17:42,283 --> 01:17:43,455
She very sick.

991
01:17:43,784 --> 01:17:45,377

992
01:17:48,122 --> 01:17:49,419

Husband die Mexico when they make small.

996
01:18:02,970 --> 01:18:05,267
Stupid people forget take
the gold from the teeth.

997

Head explode.

998
01:18:06,724 --> 01:18:09,068
- What?
- Husband head explode.

999
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:12,234
Head explode! From teeth.

1000
01:18:12,730 --> 01:18:14,482
She come alone, no money.

1001
01:18:14,565 --> 01:18:17,238
I meet her, she housekeeper
first host family.

1002
01:18:17,318 --> 01:18:20,413
Rich Leisureland people.
Now she sick, no more work.

1003
01:18:20,779 --> 01:18:22,452
Okay, you take care for her.

1004
01:18:26,452 --> 01:18:28,125
I can't do anything for her.

1005
01:18:28,454 --> 01:18:31,754
That woman is really sick.
It looks like she might die!

1006
01:18:31,957 --> 01:18:33,630
Yeah, she die soon.

1007
01:18:33,792 --> 01:18:36,216
Cancer. Cancer all over stomach.

1008
01:18:36,503 --> 01:18:39,928
I be with her she die.
Most bad thing die alone.

1009
01:18:57,816 --> 01:18:59,739
Come on. Be like doctor.

1010
01:19:02,404 --> 01:19:04,077
Make her feel good.

1011
01:19:19,588 --> 01:19:21,340
Which pill most good for her?

1012
01:19:22,424 --> 01:19:23,721
I have no idea.

1013
01:19:23,801 --> 01:19:25,723
But you know thing.

1014
01:19:25,803 --> 01:19:27,476
Which pill most strong?

1015
01:19:31,392 --> 01:19:32,484
Percocet.

1016
01:19:33,477 --> 01:19:36,231
Yes, Percocet. Very good for pain.

1017
01:19:36,605 --> 01:19:39,199
How much? Two? Four? Five? How much?

1018
01:19:40,276 --> 01:19:41,448
Try two.

1019
01:19:42,069 --> 01:19:44,914
Two? This lady very sick. Pill old.

1020
01:19:45,239 --> 01:19:46,582
We give four.

1021
01:19:53,372 --> 01:19:54,715
<i>Gracias,</i> doctor.

1022
01:19:57,876 --> 01:19:59,965
Have you tried to
move her every couple hours,

1023
01:20:00,045 --> 01:20:01,888
so she doesn't get bedsores?

1024
01:20:03,299 --> 01:20:05,051
We should probably do that.

1025
01:20:07,011 --> 01:20:09,225
Go. There you go. Okay.

1026
01:20:09,305 --> 01:20:11,433
See? You know thing.

1027
01:20:18,981 --> 01:20:21,985
Thank you, Mr. Dušan friend.
You help Gladys good.

1028
01:20:22,401 --> 01:20:23,903
Okay. Well,

1029
01:20:24,737 --> 01:20:26,158
let's make those adjustments.

1030
01:20:26,238 --> 01:20:27,911
If you just want to slip off your foot.

1031
01:20:28,073 --> 01:20:29,746
No, no foot. I tired.

1032
01:20:29,908 --> 01:20:32,662
You go away. I stay with
Gladys, you go away now.

1033
01:20:33,412 --> 01:20:35,834
- Really? I mean...
- I tired. You go away.

1034
01:20:35,914 --> 01:20:37,041
Okay.

1035
01:20:37,124 --> 01:20:38,876
Some other time, I guess.

1036
01:20:39,460 --> 01:20:42,054
I just don't know
when I'm gonna see you again.

1037
01:20:43,380 --> 01:20:45,553
Thursday. You come Thursday, okay?

1038
01:20:45,966 --> 01:20:48,970
Thursday morning you come fix leg. 10:00.

1039
01:20:51,972 --> 01:20:53,724
Thursday at 10:00.

1040
01:20:58,979 --> 01:21:02,483
My name's Paul, by the way. Paul Safranek.

1041
01:21:12,034 --> 01:21:13,126
<i>Let's see...</i>

1042
01:21:13,535 --> 01:21:15,874
The extra-large is available in

1043
01:21:15,954 --> 01:21:20,835
glacier, pebble, tulip, cayenne,
moss and aubergine.

1044
01:21:21,418 --> 01:21:24,172
<i>Cayenne? Is that like red?</i>

1045
01:21:25,339 --> 01:21:28,429
It's a brownish red. It's more like brick.

1046
01:21:28,509 --> 01:21:30,512
<i>No, I don't like brick.</i>

1047
01:21:31,011 --> 01:21:33,014
<i>Do you think moss is pretty?</i>

1048
01:21:33,430 --> 01:21:35,019
You know, I don't know, lady.

1049
01:21:35,099 --> 01:21:37,067
Why don't you just pick a color, please?

1050
01:21:37,393 --> 01:21:39,396
<i>Don't be short with me!</i>

1051
01:21:39,770 --> 01:21:41,272
What did you say?

1052
01:21:53,283 --> 01:21:54,284
Hi.

1053
01:21:56,245 --> 01:21:57,246

1054
01:22:00,916 --> 01:22:02,008
Where's Gladys?

1055
01:22:02,668 --> 01:22:03,795
She die.

1056
01:22:04,002 --> 01:22:05,215
No.

1057
01:22:05,295 --> 01:22:06,513
I'm so sorry.

1058
01:22:07,005 --> 01:22:09,178
I think maybe I give her too much pill.

1059
01:22:09,425 --> 01:22:12,019
Anyway, she die very happy, smiling.

1060
01:22:13,178 --> 01:22:15,556
- Okay, you fix foot now.
- What?

1061
01:22:19,601 --> 01:22:20,819
You do quick.

1062
01:22:21,145 --> 01:22:24,649
Must clean house soon, one hour.
You do quick.

1063
01:22:26,024 --> 01:22:27,321
Quick!

1064
01:22:34,408 --> 01:22:35,751
Thank you, very nice.

1065
01:22:35,993 --> 01:22:38,667
You finish soon, okay? I very busy.

1066
01:22:38,996 --> 01:22:40,339
I'm getting there.

1067
01:22:47,087 --> 01:22:49,090
I guess you like butterflies.

1068
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:52,009
Butterflies?

1069
01:22:52,176 --> 01:22:54,270
Yes, I like very much.

1070
01:22:54,845 --> 01:22:59,442
When I little girl, my father,
he take me, my sister go see butterfly.

1071
01:22:59,975 --> 01:23:02,319
Near my village they live in the tree.

1072
01:23:02,811 --> 01:23:04,063
You know,

1073
01:23:04,313 --> 01:23:08,159
they fly cold place to hot place every year.

1074
01:23:08,525 --> 01:23:10,869
Stay tree, then go away, come back.

1075
01:23:13,071 --> 01:23:14,414
Migrating butterflies.

1076
01:23:14,698 --> 01:23:16,541
- Yes.
- That sounds beautiful.

1077
01:23:17,784 --> 01:23:19,787
How do you say "butterfly" in Vietnamese?

1078
01:23:30,339 --> 01:23:31,761
You miss your village?

1079
01:23:32,174 --> 01:23:33,517
No more village.

1080
01:23:34,009 --> 01:23:37,263
Government make the people
go away, put water all over.

1081
01:23:37,429 --> 01:23:39,682
All over everywhere! Too much water.

1082
01:23:39,973 --> 01:23:41,316
Too much water?

1083
01:23:41,475 --> 01:23:43,648
Big water for make electricity.

1084
01:23:43,810 --> 01:23:44,811
A dam.

1085
01:23:44,978 --> 01:23:47,322
Yes, dam. They make dam.

1086
01:23:48,065 --> 01:23:50,238
Many village no more.

1087
01:23:51,026 --> 01:23:52,949
That's why I go prison.

1088
01:23:53,070 --> 01:23:55,494
Me, my sister make protest.

1089
01:23:55,906 --> 01:23:57,158
Big protest.

1090
01:23:59,326 --> 01:24:01,169
Well, where's your sister now?

1091
01:24:02,663 --> 01:24:04,586
She die prison.

1092
01:24:09,836 --> 01:24:13,340
Too cold, chest fill up bad. She die.

1093
01:24:27,813 --> 01:24:29,736
- What happened?
- Nothing.

1094
01:24:31,692 --> 01:24:33,194
Just give me a minute.

1095
01:24:33,318 --> 01:24:35,412
- What you do?
- No, nothing, nothing.

1096
01:24:36,071 --> 01:24:37,242
You stupid man!

1097
01:24:37,322 --> 01:24:39,700
You needed a new foot anyway.
We'll get you a good one.

1098
01:24:39,783 --> 01:24:41,160
Is that so hard to understand?

1099
01:24:41,243 --> 01:24:43,667
- Jesus!
- No say Jesus bad way.

1100
01:24:44,079 --> 01:24:45,956
Now I'm supposed to watch my language?

1101
01:24:46,039 --> 01:24:47,416
You're worse than my mother.

1102
01:24:47,583 --> 01:24:49,046
I feel sorry for your mother.

1103
01:24:49,126 --> 01:24:51,754
I sure she suffer too much for your fault.

1104
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:58,347
Not do so fast!

1105
01:24:58,677 --> 01:25:01,852
Vacuum cleaner need time
same direction clean good.

1106
01:25:11,982 --> 01:25:13,195
And you can take these.

1107
01:25:13,275 --> 01:25:16,245
These are samosas from a couple of days ago.

1108
01:25:16,903 --> 01:25:19,497
Thank you, yes. I take all these.

1109
01:25:20,157 --> 01:25:22,079
I think this is saag paneer.

1110
01:25:22,159 --> 01:25:24,082
It might be a little bit old.

1111
01:25:27,664 --> 01:25:30,167
In prison we die for such food.

1112
01:25:33,754 --> 01:25:36,007
Okay. Not too many leftover entrees today,

1113
01:25:36,089 --> 01:25:37,762
but I threw in lots of baked potato soup.

1114
01:25:38,508 --> 01:25:39,851
Thank you, Roger.

1115
01:25:40,052 --> 01:25:41,179
There you go.

1116
01:25:42,095 --> 01:25:44,223
Hey, you finally got yourself
a helper, Ngoc Lan?

1117
01:25:44,890 --> 01:25:47,234
This Paul. He break my foot.

1118
01:25:49,394 --> 01:25:50,482
How'd you manage that, buddy?

1119
01:25:50,562 --> 01:25:51,984
It's a long story. We're sorting it out.

1120
01:25:52,147 --> 01:25:53,649
He stupid!

1121
01:26:04,910 --> 01:26:07,254
<i>Hola, Señor</i> Càrdenas.

1122
01:26:25,931 --> 01:26:28,400
Okay. Over here. This way.

1123
01:26:37,150 --> 01:26:38,402
That looks really painful.

1124
01:26:44,199 --> 01:26:46,452
I bet that's ringworm,

1125
01:26:46,535 --> 01:26:48,123
which I don't know how to say in Spanish.

1126
01:26:48,203 --> 01:26:52,208
But ringworm is a fungus, so you want it dry.

1127
01:26:55,585 --> 01:26:57,549
And I'll see if I can pick something up

1128
01:26:57,629 --> 01:26:59,343
at the drugstore
and bring it for him tomorrow.

1129
01:26:59,423 --> 01:27:00,595
Yes, you bring.

1130
01:27:05,095 --> 01:27:06,313
Okay, next. Let's go.

1131
01:27:08,056 --> 01:27:09,979
- Let's go!
- I'm coming.

1132
01:27:14,062 --> 01:27:15,150
Take care for him.

1133
01:27:15,230 --> 01:27:16,482
- See you next time.
- <i>Gracias.</i>

1134
01:27:18,483 --> 01:27:20,076
So that's it? We go home now?

1135
01:27:20,235 --> 01:27:22,454
Now we go church pray Jesus.

1136
01:27:52,392 --> 01:27:55,065
You come back tomorrow, pick me up 8:00.

1137
01:27:55,145 --> 01:27:56,988
Yeah, okay, I'll be here.

1138
01:28:06,823 --> 01:28:08,286
Good morning, Mr. Dušan.

1139
01:28:08,366 --> 01:28:09,913
We come clean for you.

1140
01:28:30,514 --> 01:28:33,518
Answering telephones was not
dignified enough for you.

1141
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:35,648
Now you progress to cleaning toilets.

1142
01:28:35,894 --> 01:28:37,567
I love you, Paul.

1143
01:28:37,896 --> 01:28:40,741
I really love you. You're such a funny guy.

1144
01:28:41,066 --> 01:28:42,158
Hilarious.

1145
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:45,904
Like I said, you're too much a nice guy

1146
01:28:46,279 --> 01:28:48,623
and a little bit pathetic guy.

1147
01:28:48,907 --> 01:28:50,750
It's just until she gets a new foot.

1148
01:28:50,909 --> 01:28:53,253
- When will that be?
- I don't know. The doctor said

1149
01:28:53,411 --> 01:28:54,913
a month, maybe six weeks.

1150
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:57,083
- That's an eternity.
- I know!

1151
01:28:57,290 --> 01:28:59,042
Meantime, she's stuck with a peg leg,

1152
01:28:59,251 --> 01:29:01,173
which is almost as bad as
having nothing at all.

1153
01:29:01,253 --> 01:29:02,254
I mean, look at her!

1154
01:29:02,337 --> 01:29:04,965
She's waddling around like a goddamn pirate.

1155
01:29:06,842 --> 01:29:08,889
Paul! You no talk with Mr. Dušan.

1156
01:29:08,969 --> 01:29:10,846
You go upstair with Verónica.

1157
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:13,727
- Paul!
- I heard you.

1158
01:29:14,182 --> 01:29:15,775
Don't worry, Paul.

1159
01:29:18,603 --> 01:29:20,446
Dušan will save you.

1160
01:29:34,911 --> 01:29:37,084
Yeah, Miss Tran, take everything.

1161
01:29:38,999 --> 01:29:42,128
Mr. Konrad and I are
leaving day after tomorrow

1162
01:29:42,210 --> 01:29:44,053
and don't know when we'll be back.

1163
01:29:45,171 --> 01:29:46,844
Okay, good. Thank you.

1164
01:29:47,257 --> 01:29:49,179
Paul, Mr. Dušan say I take all the food.

1165
01:29:49,259 --> 01:29:50,932
You go find me big box.

1166
01:29:51,177 --> 01:29:52,178
In a minute.

1167
01:29:52,262 --> 01:29:55,141
First there's something
very important to discuss.

1168
01:29:57,225 --> 01:29:58,226
Me?

1169
01:29:58,310 --> 01:30:00,483
This is the situation.

1170
01:30:00,645 --> 01:30:02,568
I don't know exactly what,

1171
01:30:02,731 --> 01:30:04,734
but something big, very big,

1172
01:30:04,816 --> 01:30:07,240
is happening at the original small colony.

1173
01:30:07,611 --> 01:30:09,454
You know, the one in Norway.

1174
01:30:10,071 --> 01:30:13,746
They want me to go there right away
with a very important delivery.

1175
01:30:14,242 --> 01:30:15,705
It's too complicated to explain.

1176
01:30:15,785 --> 01:30:18,539
Top secret and very urgent,

1177
01:30:18,622 --> 01:30:23,503
but most important,
they are offering us very big money.

1178
01:30:24,169 --> 01:30:25,170
Very big.

1179
01:30:25,253 --> 01:30:26,755
And that means

1180
01:30:27,005 --> 01:30:31,135
we need extra help to do this quickly,
make them happy

1181
01:30:31,217 --> 01:30:33,807
and, I'm sorry to say,
we need the same excellent helper

1182
01:30:33,887 --> 01:30:35,560
who's currently helping you.

1183
01:30:35,805 --> 01:30:36,806
Him.

1184
01:30:37,140 --> 01:30:38,478
That's right, Ngoc Lan.

1185
01:30:38,558 --> 01:30:41,061
I have to go with these guys to Norway.

1186
01:30:43,688 --> 01:30:46,032
So you say

1187
01:30:46,483 --> 01:30:48,611
Paul go with you Norway?

1188
01:30:48,985 --> 01:30:50,737
That's the situation.

1189
01:30:51,237 --> 01:30:54,741
- Emergency situation!
- And deeply humanitarian.

1190
01:30:56,159 --> 01:30:57,998
I mean, Ngoc Lan, I will

1191
01:30:58,078 --> 01:31:02,254
be able to help when I get back 100%,
and when you get the new foot, and...

1192
01:31:02,499 --> 01:31:04,001
You leave Wednesday?

1193
01:31:04,501 --> 01:31:05,502
Yes.

1194
01:31:06,795 --> 01:31:08,513
And how long you go?

1195
01:31:11,967 --> 01:31:13,970
Ten days, maybe more.

1196
01:31:19,724 --> 01:31:21,476
Okay. Yes, Norway.

1197
01:31:21,935 --> 01:31:23,687
I go Norway, too.

1198
01:31:24,104 --> 01:31:26,107
No, no, no. Not you.

1199
01:31:26,690 --> 01:31:28,028
Only Paul.

1200
01:31:28,108 --> 01:31:30,953
I go Norway, too.
Paul, you help me on the trip.

1201
01:31:32,362 --> 01:31:33,533
But you're very busy here

1202
01:31:33,613 --> 01:31:36,037
with humanitarian activities on your own.

1203
01:31:36,533 --> 01:31:38,206
And your cleaning business!

1204
01:31:38,785 --> 01:31:41,288
Verónica and other ladies know every place.

1205
01:31:41,371 --> 01:31:42,873
They do for me, I pay them good.

1206
01:31:42,956 --> 01:31:44,549
No problem I go.

1207
01:31:45,291 --> 01:31:47,714
Norway colony people invite me so many time,

1208
01:31:47,794 --> 01:31:49,296
but I never go.

1209
01:31:49,379 --> 01:31:51,632
Feel so, so guilty!

1210
01:31:52,716 --> 01:31:54,468
They so nice people.

1211
01:31:55,343 --> 01:31:56,344
What?

1212
01:31:56,678 --> 01:31:58,305
Who invited you?

1213
01:31:59,806 --> 01:32:02,901
When I hospital so long time after TV box,

1214
01:32:03,226 --> 01:32:05,320

1215
01:32:05,478 --> 01:32:08,823

1216
01:32:09,065 --> 01:32:10,567
Make me feel good.

So many letter.

1218
01:32:12,736 --> 01:32:15,239
One letter very special I never forget.

1219
01:32:15,572 --> 01:32:17,916
From Jorgen Asbjørnsen.

1220
01:32:19,576 --> 01:32:22,125
You got a letter from Jorgen Asbjørnsen?

1221
01:32:22,912 --> 01:32:25,006
Dr. Asbjørnsen write me.

1222
01:32:25,665 --> 01:32:30,171
Say he feel so, so bad I suffer for he fault.

1223
01:32:32,005 --> 01:32:33,843
He say he painful.

1224
01:32:33,923 --> 01:32:36,677
He never think make small so bad for people.

1225
01:32:38,511 --> 01:32:41,310
Dr. Asbjørnsen letter make me feel so good,

1226
01:32:41,723 --> 01:32:43,225
I write letter, too.

1227
01:32:43,308 --> 01:32:46,562
Say now first time I happy be small.

1228
01:32:49,898 --> 01:32:52,902
He say me make trip go Norway any day.

1229
01:32:53,735 --> 01:32:55,658
But I too busy.

1230
01:32:55,987 --> 01:32:57,200
Always too busy.

1231
01:32:57,280 --> 01:33:01,001
Now Jesus give me special gift go Norway.

1232
01:33:03,495 --> 01:33:06,840
Thank you, Mr. Dušan. Thank you, Mr. Konrad.

1233
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,754
Yes. I go Norway, too.

1234
01:33:11,961 --> 01:33:13,634
So happy!

1235
01:33:14,005 --> 01:33:16,178
Thank you special time.

1236
01:35:16,878 --> 01:35:18,050
Paul, look.

1237
01:35:18,379 --> 01:35:21,383
This Jorgen Asbjørnsen and he wife.

1238
01:35:23,218 --> 01:35:26,063
Oh, my God. Jorgen Asbjørnsen?

1239
01:35:27,472 --> 01:35:28,599
Hello.

1240
01:35:28,681 --> 01:35:31,400
- It's just such an honor.
- Hello, hello.

1241
01:35:31,768 --> 01:35:32,860
See, Paul?

1242
01:35:33,519 --> 01:35:35,146
Jesus smile for me.

1243
01:35:35,230 --> 01:35:38,154
I say Paul I want visit Norway
only for meet you.

1244
01:35:38,816 --> 01:35:39,908
It's true.

1245
01:35:40,068 --> 01:35:41,786
- I'm Anne-Helene.
- Hello.

1246
01:35:42,237 --> 01:35:43,910
Please sit. Join us.

1247
01:35:44,239 --> 01:35:45,331
Thank you.

1248
01:35:45,657 --> 01:35:47,284
We're watching the world go by.

1249
01:35:47,367 --> 01:35:48,744
Sounds great.

1250
01:35:49,744 --> 01:35:51,916
You have no idea how terribly grief-stricken

1251
01:35:51,996 --> 01:35:54,294
we were by Miss Tran's case.

1252
01:35:54,791 --> 01:35:58,295
Jorgen has lost so much sleep
over all the abuses.

1253
01:36:08,680 --> 01:36:10,398
It's humbling, huh?

1254
01:36:11,474 --> 01:36:14,569
Nature is such a patient sculptor.

1255
01:36:14,894 --> 01:36:16,737
Grinding a tiny bit

1256
01:36:16,896 --> 01:36:20,361
each day, slowly, slowly,
for thousands of years,

1257
01:36:20,441 --> 01:36:25,243
to make such a supremely beautiful thing.

1258
01:36:27,573 --> 01:36:28,995
What a waste.

1259
01:36:31,160 --> 01:36:34,164
What a dreadful waste.

1260
01:36:44,007 --> 01:36:45,678
You'll have to excuse Jorgen.

1261
01:36:45,758 --> 01:36:49,012
These past few days has been especially hard.

1262
01:36:49,429 --> 01:36:52,023
Such a big decision to make, and so quickly.

1263
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:55,438
Normally, when we visit the colony,
we like to spend

1264
01:36:55,518 --> 01:36:58,897
a few days in Henningsvær,
but then the news came.

1265
01:36:59,897 --> 01:37:00,898
And...

1266
01:37:01,065 --> 01:37:04,569
Yeah, well, here we are,
suddenly imposing on you.

1267
01:37:04,944 --> 01:37:06,947
We scarcely had the time to pack.

1268
01:37:08,072 --> 01:37:10,040
I'm sorry, wait, what news?

1269
01:37:10,700 --> 01:37:13,373
Why, the methane release in Antarctica.

1270
01:37:13,453 --> 01:37:15,421
You must know about the methane.

1271
01:37:16,456 --> 01:37:17,457
Yeah.

1272
01:37:17,790 --> 01:37:19,542
That's not new, is it? I mean...

1273
01:37:20,835 --> 01:37:22,428
New or old,

1274
01:37:23,171 --> 01:37:24,673
it's the end.

1275
01:37:25,757 --> 01:37:28,511
It's the end of everything.

1276
01:37:30,762 --> 01:37:34,733
The world has already seen
five major extinctions,

1277
01:37:35,308 --> 01:37:36,981
and now there will be another.

1278
01:37:37,435 --> 01:37:40,860
I didn't want to believe it, none of us did,

1279
01:37:41,064 --> 01:37:45,069
but there we were in Helsinki, big and small,

1280
01:37:45,234 --> 01:37:47,988
Climatologists, bacteriologists,

1281
01:37:48,154 --> 01:37:51,579
demographers, physicists, immunologists.

1282
01:37:51,908 --> 01:37:55,253
Twenty-six Nobel Prize winners among us.

1283
01:37:55,995 --> 01:37:58,584
We built all the models, did all the math

1284
01:37:58,664 --> 01:38:01,588
and our conclusion was consistent.

1285
01:38:02,418 --> 01:38:05,843
Homo sapiens will soon vanish from the Earth.

1286
01:38:06,756 --> 01:38:09,760
It is now an actuarial certainty.

1287
01:38:11,094 --> 01:38:13,438
No matter how the end will come,

1288
01:38:13,596 --> 01:38:15,810
environmental disaster,

1289
01:38:15,890 --> 01:38:20,236
pandemic disease, unbreathable air,
impotable water,

1290
01:38:20,478 --> 01:38:22,900
not enough food, nuclear winter,

1291
01:38:22,980 --> 01:38:25,825
some combination of them all,

1292
01:38:27,026 --> 01:38:32,249
relatively soon the Earth will indeed
purge itself of human life

1293
01:38:33,324 --> 01:38:36,078
and God knows how many other species.

1294
01:38:37,578 --> 01:38:38,955
Do you really mean extinction?

1295
01:38:39,038 --> 01:38:40,585
What about downsizing?

1296
01:38:40,665 --> 01:38:42,668
Yeah, yeah, too little too late.

1297
01:38:42,750 --> 01:38:45,720
Only 3% of the world has miniaturized.

1298
01:38:45,878 --> 01:38:47,846
There simply isn't enough time.

1299
01:38:51,843 --> 01:38:55,564
Not a very successful species,
these Homo sapiens,

1300
01:38:55,972 --> 01:38:58,566
even with such great intelligence.

1301
01:38:58,891 --> 01:39:01,565
Barely 200,000 years.

1302
01:39:01,894 --> 01:39:06,946
Alligator has survived 200 million years
with a brain the size of a walnut.

1303
01:39:11,654 --> 01:39:12,867
People have been predicting

1304
01:39:12,947 --> 01:39:15,575
the end of the world for thousands of years.

1305
01:39:16,576 --> 01:39:18,579
Now it's really happening.

1306
01:39:20,997 --> 01:39:23,421
I guess somebody had to be right someday.

1307
01:39:24,834 --> 01:39:26,256
So sad.

1308
01:39:27,712 --> 01:39:29,055
Very sad.

1309
01:39:43,311 --> 01:39:46,565
Okay, I go sleep now. Good night, Paul.

1310
01:39:47,398 --> 01:39:49,321
Good night, Ngoc Lan.

1311
01:39:53,821 --> 01:39:55,994
- You okay?
- I fine.

1312
01:39:56,407 --> 01:39:58,910
You know, maybe I should
take a look at your leg.

1313
01:39:59,076 --> 01:40:01,079
Okay. Yes, you look.

1314
01:40:06,083 --> 01:40:07,255
Yep.

1315
01:40:09,337 --> 01:40:12,091
That peg is really making the skin chafe.

1316
01:40:12,757 --> 01:40:14,134
Okay.

1317
01:40:21,766 --> 01:40:22,813
You know,

1318
01:40:23,809 --> 01:40:26,149
if somebody had told me 10 years ago

1319
01:40:26,229 --> 01:40:29,404
that one day I'd be
five inches tall and divorced

1320
01:40:29,815 --> 01:40:32,660
helping a famous Vietnamese
dissident get a new foot

1321
01:40:32,818 --> 01:40:35,283
while cruising up a fjord in Norway

1322
01:40:35,363 --> 01:40:38,082
discussing the end of the world
with Jorgen Asbjørnsen,

1323
01:40:39,408 --> 01:40:41,331
I'd have said he was crazy.

1324
01:41:16,988 --> 01:41:18,080
I'm sorry.

1325
01:41:18,447 --> 01:41:19,869
I'm sorry, I thought...

1326
01:41:21,158 --> 01:41:22,330
Jesus, I'm such an idiot.

1327
01:41:22,868 --> 01:41:23,869
No.

1328
01:41:25,705 --> 01:41:27,958
Please. I want.

1329
01:42:05,244 --> 01:42:06,587
Good morning.

1330
01:42:09,123 --> 01:42:10,466
Good morning.

1331
01:42:13,961 --> 01:42:15,338
What's that sound?

1332
01:42:15,963 --> 01:42:17,306
A greeting.

1333
01:43:52,059 --> 01:43:54,774
That's it. That's the original colony!

1334
01:43:54,854 --> 01:43:57,608
What, and there's no net? No walls?

1335
01:43:57,690 --> 01:43:58,986
No, we've been lucky.

1336
01:43:59,066 --> 01:44:02,115
We are too close to the sea
for the mosquitoes.

1337
01:44:02,445 --> 01:44:04,992
And over the years we realized
that the birds,

1338
01:44:05,072 --> 01:44:06,949
they prefer the lemmings.

1339
01:44:07,283 --> 01:44:11,413
But, yes, this is where we started
many years ago.

1340
01:44:46,989 --> 01:44:48,832
George, good to see you.

1341
01:44:49,283 --> 01:44:51,247
Good to see you. Welcome, welcome.

1342
01:44:51,327 --> 01:44:52,579
No, no...

1343
01:44:52,661 --> 01:44:53,662
Jorgen!

1344
01:44:54,371 --> 01:44:55,793
Anne-Helene!

1345
01:44:56,123 --> 01:45:00,549
Oh, thank God you're here!
Why didn't anyone tell me?

1346
01:45:02,046 --> 01:45:04,640
I love you so much!

1347
01:45:05,633 --> 01:45:07,977
I love you both so much.

1348
01:45:08,844 --> 01:45:12,098
Ever since the decision,
I didn't feel right without you here.

1349
01:45:12,389 --> 01:45:14,186
And you know how I am when I worry.

1350
01:45:14,266 --> 01:45:16,064
I can't eat, I can't sleep.

1351
01:45:16,227 --> 01:45:18,480
Ask anyone here, they tell you.

1352
01:45:18,562 --> 01:45:20,815
Sorry to interrupt, Jorgen,

1353
01:45:20,898 --> 01:45:23,070
but we need your advice. Immediately.

1354
01:45:23,150 --> 01:45:24,652
Yes. Excuse us, Solveig.

1355
01:45:24,819 --> 01:45:25,865
Of course, darling.

1356
01:45:25,945 --> 01:45:28,118
You've got important things to do.

1357
01:45:29,490 --> 01:45:32,329
Dušan, Dušan, Dušan!

1358
01:45:32,409 --> 01:45:35,504
Bless you for coming so quickly.

1359
01:45:37,998 --> 01:45:39,500
Solveig, my darling.

1360
01:45:39,583 --> 01:45:42,337
I'm always happy to help in difficult times,

1361
01:45:42,419 --> 01:45:43,591
in easy times, in happy times.

1362
01:45:43,754 --> 01:45:45,718
It's always a pleasure to come and visit you

1363
01:45:45,798 --> 01:45:47,425
and your lovely village.

1364
01:45:47,758 --> 01:45:50,011
It is lovely, isn't it?

1365
01:45:50,344 --> 01:45:53,689
I can't bear to think I won't see it again.

1366
01:45:54,348 --> 01:45:58,524
You know, I'm the one who made
this colony possible in the first place.

1367
01:45:58,811 --> 01:46:01,530
I've been coming since I was just a baby.

1368
01:46:01,897 --> 01:46:04,070
I remember one time...

1369
01:46:04,942 --> 01:46:07,161
Wait. I know you.

1370
01:46:07,820 --> 01:46:10,414
You were in my dream last night!

1371
01:46:10,656 --> 01:46:13,159
You were a horse, or a pony.

1372
01:46:13,325 --> 01:46:14,998
Something very strong!

1373
01:46:15,327 --> 01:46:16,829
And I mounted you

1374
01:46:16,912 --> 01:46:20,507
and rode you through a dangerous forest.

1375
01:46:21,166 --> 01:46:23,669
- Okay.
- And here you are,

1376
01:46:24,003 --> 01:46:26,176
right before we leave.

1377
01:46:26,505 --> 01:46:28,508
Another miracle!

1378
01:46:29,008 --> 01:46:31,602
You are coming with us, aren't you?

1379
01:46:32,177 --> 01:46:33,349
Where are you going?

1380
01:46:35,180 --> 01:46:36,523
In there.

1381
01:46:36,932 --> 01:46:38,605
Would you like to see?

1382
01:46:50,613 --> 01:46:51,785
Where this go?

1383
01:46:52,489 --> 01:46:54,241
To the vault!

1384
01:46:55,159 --> 01:46:56,832
- The vault?
- Yes.

1385
01:46:56,994 --> 01:46:59,998
We've been working on it
almost since the very beginning.

1386
01:47:00,831 --> 01:47:03,004
When Jorgen made his big discovery,

1387
01:47:03,417 --> 01:47:06,091
I said, "Look, Jorgen, you're a genius

1388
01:47:06,337 --> 01:47:10,683
and downsizing is a genius idea,
no one is questioning that,

1389
01:47:10,925 --> 01:47:14,350
but what if people don't accept it?

1390
01:47:14,595 --> 01:47:17,144
What if it doesn't come out on time?"

1391
01:47:17,890 --> 01:47:20,234
Anyway, this is what they came up with.

1392
01:47:20,351 --> 01:47:22,274
On my suggestion.

1393
01:47:22,895 --> 01:47:26,991
Torvald, be a sweetheart
and give our friends a little tour.

1394
01:47:28,025 --> 01:47:29,026
Sure.

1395
01:47:29,443 --> 01:47:32,533
The tunnel leads to a vault 1.6 kilometers

1396
01:47:32,613 --> 01:47:34,115
inside the Earth's lithosphere

1397
01:47:34,406 --> 01:47:37,751
and is encased in a double
layer of Inconel 625.

1398
01:47:38,077 --> 01:47:41,627
In addition to maintaining
a broad spectrum of biodiversity,

1399
01:47:41,914 --> 01:47:45,259
the vault is equipped with
fields for growing foods,

1400
01:47:45,417 --> 01:47:49,217
forests for lumber,
livestock for animal husbandry...

1401
01:47:49,588 --> 01:47:53,843
The residential areas are spacious
and easily expandable

1402
01:47:54,093 --> 01:47:56,437
to provide for future generations.

1403
01:47:57,680 --> 01:48:00,183
Wait, but... That's not all underground.

1404
01:48:00,349 --> 01:48:01,476
Oh, yes.

1405
01:48:01,767 --> 01:48:04,521
Our new small size makes it possible.

1406
01:48:04,687 --> 01:48:08,692
Otherwise we never could have dreamed
of preserving so much of the world

1407
01:48:08,941 --> 01:48:11,069
in a single safe place.

1408
01:48:11,318 --> 01:48:13,241
This is brilliant!

1409
01:48:13,988 --> 01:48:16,707
I mean, isn't this brilliant?
It's like Noah's Ark!

1410
01:48:17,533 --> 01:48:18,534
Yes, exactly.

1411
01:48:18,617 --> 01:48:20,244
It's Noah's Ark.

1412
01:48:20,327 --> 01:48:23,331
So, what do you do for power? Is it nuclear?

1413
01:48:23,414 --> 01:48:25,417
No, no, 100% geothermal.

1414
01:48:25,666 --> 01:48:27,794
And we have interoperable organic systems

1415
01:48:27,876 --> 01:48:30,591
to manage production of artificial sunlight,

1416
01:48:30,671 --> 01:48:34,847
oxygen, CO2 elimination,
water purification, and so on.

1417
01:48:37,511 --> 01:48:39,684
And how long will you stay down there?

1418
01:48:40,014 --> 01:48:41,687
Torvald, how long is it?

1419
01:48:42,016 --> 01:48:43,484
8,000 years?

1420
01:48:43,809 --> 01:48:45,356
Well, something like that.

1421
01:48:45,436 --> 01:48:48,235
Just until the surface
environment stabilizes.

1422
01:48:51,567 --> 01:48:54,321
<i>It's not unprecedented
what we are doing here.</i>

1423
01:48:54,737 --> 01:48:56,951
Less than 100,000 years ago,

1424
01:48:57,031 --> 01:48:59,659
humans underwent a near extinction.

1425
01:49:00,075 --> 01:49:01,918
Maybe 2,000 survived.

1426
01:49:02,077 --> 01:49:03,374
And from that handful

1427
01:49:03,454 --> 01:49:05,832
came all of the billions
of people you see today.

1428
01:49:05,998 --> 01:49:08,295
Rebooting the species. It's nothing new.

1429
01:49:08,375 --> 01:49:09,467
Yeah, exactly.

1430
01:49:17,926 --> 01:49:19,428
My friends.

1431
01:49:19,928 --> 01:49:21,392
Many years ago,

1432
01:49:21,472 --> 01:49:24,442
when we discovered cellular miniaturization,

1433
01:49:24,892 --> 01:49:30,319
the world which had seemed so doomed
felt suddenly so full of possibilities.

1434
01:49:31,523 --> 01:49:34,026
So, until very recently,

1435
01:49:34,109 --> 01:49:35,531
I maintained hope

1436
01:49:35,694 --> 01:49:38,448
that the contingency plan
we embark upon tomorrow

1437
01:49:38,530 --> 01:49:40,703
could remain simply that.

1438
01:49:41,450 --> 01:49:42,872
A plan.

1439
01:49:44,411 --> 01:49:45,503
But

1440
01:49:46,080 --> 01:49:47,923
history has spoken.

1441
01:49:48,499 --> 01:49:52,840
And this is our final dinner
in the place we called home

1442
01:49:52,920 --> 01:49:54,672
for so many years.

1443
01:49:55,339 --> 01:49:58,684
Yes, we are sad to leave.

1444
01:49:59,718 --> 01:50:03,564
And terribly sad for the reasons why.

1445
01:50:05,140 --> 01:50:08,394
But man is too beautiful,

1446
01:50:09,728 --> 01:50:12,607
too improbable a lifeform

1447
01:50:12,689 --> 01:50:16,444
to be allowed to disappear forever
from the cosmos.

1448
01:50:19,113 --> 01:50:20,285
Now then,

1449
01:50:21,990 --> 01:50:24,493
I would like to ask the surviving members

1450
01:50:24,576 --> 01:50:27,000
of the original colony to stand.

1451
01:50:40,175 --> 01:50:41,427
Look at him.

1452
01:50:41,844 --> 01:50:43,346
Little Ronni.

1453
01:50:43,595 --> 01:50:45,347
How he has grown.

1454
01:50:50,477 --> 01:50:55,153
I ask you again, as I asked you
so many years ago.

1455
01:50:56,400 --> 01:50:58,238
Generations to come,

1456
01:50:58,318 --> 01:51:03,074
perhaps all of humanity will thank you
for your bravery and commitment.

1457
01:51:03,699 --> 01:51:04,995
But you must ask yourself

1458
01:51:05,075 --> 01:51:07,874
whether you are truly ready
to enter a new world,

1459
01:51:08,328 --> 01:51:11,173
for there will be no turning back.

1460
01:51:12,916 --> 01:51:14,338
Are you ready?

1461
01:51:20,924 --> 01:51:22,767
Is everyone ready?

1462
01:51:28,640 --> 01:51:32,816
We are ready! We are ready! We are ready!

1463
01:52:12,100 --> 01:52:13,101
Paul!

1464
01:52:15,020 --> 01:52:16,021
Yeah.

1465
01:52:16,480 --> 01:52:18,027
Can you come down here?

1466
01:52:23,237 --> 01:52:26,366
Where you go? I look many place for you.

1467
01:52:27,741 --> 01:52:29,204
I was just here.

1468
01:52:29,284 --> 01:52:30,455
I talk with Mr. Dušan.

1469
01:52:30,535 --> 01:52:33,254
He say fat lady pay, he ready go back.

1470
01:52:33,747 --> 01:52:34,748
I happy for that.

1471
01:52:34,831 --> 01:52:37,835
Too long time away from
<i>Señor</i> Càrdenas and Mrs. Lopez.

1472
01:52:39,169 --> 01:52:40,921
I worry too much for them.

1473
01:52:41,213 --> 01:52:44,262
Ngoc Lan, you can't just be
worried for a few little people

1474
01:52:44,508 --> 01:52:45,930
thousands of miles away.

1475
01:52:46,593 --> 01:52:48,516
You have to look at the big picture.

1476
01:52:49,680 --> 01:52:51,393
Why you say like this?

1477
01:52:51,473 --> 01:52:55,068
Well, because Mr. Càrdenas and Mrs. Lopez,

1478
01:52:55,936 --> 01:52:57,900
they don't stand a chance.

1479
01:52:57,980 --> 01:52:59,568
None of us do.

1480
01:52:59,648 --> 01:53:01,070
It's over.

1481
01:53:03,235 --> 01:53:04,782
You want go with them.

1482
01:53:05,362 --> 01:53:07,330
And I want you to come with me.

1483
01:53:09,324 --> 01:53:10,496
You crazy man!

1484
01:53:10,659 --> 01:53:13,582
Always I know you stupid,
now I see you crazy, too!

1485
01:53:13,662 --> 01:53:16,210
How am I crazy? You heard them.

1486
01:53:16,290 --> 01:53:18,587
This is the only chance for
the survival of our species.

1487
01:53:18,667 --> 01:53:19,839
That's huge!

1488
01:53:20,002 --> 01:53:21,465
You want to help people?

1489
01:53:21,545 --> 01:53:23,923
These are the people
that you should be helping.

1490
01:53:24,589 --> 01:53:27,809
The future of humanity is down that hole!

1491
01:53:28,385 --> 01:53:30,137
Who you help down there?

1492
01:53:30,262 --> 01:53:33,391
People here need help, not down stupid hole.

1493
01:53:35,017 --> 01:53:36,564
Mr. Dušan! Mr. Konrad!

1494
01:53:37,144 --> 01:53:38,396
Talk to crazy Paul.

1495
01:53:38,478 --> 01:53:41,026
He want go down hole, me go with him!

1496
01:53:41,106 --> 01:53:42,527
Paul, Paul, Paul.

1497
01:53:42,607 --> 01:53:44,575
Why you want to do such a silly thing?

1498
01:53:45,193 --> 01:53:49,198
Dušan, these people are actually trying
to do something to save the human race.

1499
01:53:49,448 --> 01:53:50,744
I want to be a part of that.

1500
01:53:50,824 --> 01:53:52,287
Okay, fine. You want to help,

1501
01:53:52,367 --> 01:53:54,665
then do what I did, give them a semen sample.

1502
01:53:54,745 --> 01:53:56,083
I did it, too.

1503
01:53:56,163 --> 01:53:58,291
A much more pleasant way to help.

1504
01:53:58,373 --> 01:54:00,212
If I'm not supposed to be
a part of this thing,

1505
01:54:00,292 --> 01:54:02,090
then what am I doing here?

1506
01:54:03,253 --> 01:54:04,846
Why didn't I become a doctor?

1507
01:54:05,297 --> 01:54:07,800
Why did I downsize?
Why did my wife abandon me?

1508
01:54:07,883 --> 01:54:10,477
Dušan, how did you just happen
to be my neighbor?

1509
01:54:10,635 --> 01:54:12,638
And, Ngoc Lan, why are you the only person

1510
01:54:12,721 --> 01:54:13,934
who survived that box,

1511
01:54:14,014 --> 01:54:17,063
and you just happen to be
cleaning Dušan's place on that day?

1512
01:54:17,309 --> 01:54:19,687
And had you not lost your leg,
I wouldn't have tried to help you,

1513
01:54:19,936 --> 01:54:21,813
which, as usual, I screwed up.

1514
01:54:21,897 --> 01:54:23,986
And why did I screw it up?

1515
01:54:24,066 --> 01:54:27,614
So that I could be here,
right at the exact moment

1516
01:54:27,694 --> 01:54:29,492
to go down into that tunnel.

1517
01:54:30,364 --> 01:54:33,743
I finally have a chance
to do something that matters!

1518
01:54:34,242 --> 01:54:35,994
Paul, come on, now you talking crazy.

1519
01:54:36,411 --> 01:54:38,750
These people, they're wonderful, but...

1520
01:54:38,830 --> 01:54:40,919
- It's like a cult.
- It's a cult!

1521
01:54:40,999 --> 01:54:42,876
And the extinction, it's not gonna happen

1522
01:54:42,959 --> 01:54:44,756
for, you know, maybe a few hundred years.

1523
01:54:44,836 --> 01:54:47,259
Has nothing to do with you. Forget it.

1524
01:54:47,339 --> 01:54:49,967
Besides, you think they won't behave
like people always behave?

1525
01:54:50,217 --> 01:54:52,311
They're all going to go insane
down there and kill each other.

1526
01:54:52,552 --> 01:54:55,021
They go extinct long before we do.

1527
01:55:05,607 --> 01:55:06,945
Don't worry, darling.

1528
01:55:07,025 --> 01:55:08,071
He said it himself.

1529
01:55:08,151 --> 01:55:10,745
Nothing he ever wants to do works out.

1530
01:55:47,941 --> 01:55:49,659
It's a beautiful day, huh?

1531
01:55:50,694 --> 01:55:53,158
I mean, knowing this is the last time
I'll see the real sun,

1532
01:55:53,238 --> 01:55:55,787
it makes it so vibrant.

1533
01:55:59,828 --> 01:56:03,958
I ask you question. You say me true, okay?

1534
01:56:04,040 --> 01:56:05,132
Of course.

1535
01:56:05,459 --> 01:56:07,052
Other night on boat,

1536
01:56:07,502 --> 01:56:09,095
what kind of fuck you give me?

1537
01:56:09,754 --> 01:56:10,755
What?

1538
01:56:10,839 --> 01:56:12,591
What kind of fuck you give me?

1539
01:56:13,633 --> 01:56:15,597
What kind? I... I don't...

1540
01:56:15,677 --> 01:56:17,930
American people, eight kind of fuck.

1541
01:56:18,305 --> 01:56:21,275
Love fuck, hate fuck, sex-only fuck,

1542
01:56:21,433 --> 01:56:25,814
break-up fuck, make-up fuck, drunk fuck,
buddy fuck, pity fuck.

1543
01:56:26,104 --> 01:56:28,652
Okay, I have no idea
where you heard that, but...

1544
01:56:28,732 --> 01:56:30,070
Third host family.

1545
01:56:30,150 --> 01:56:32,494
Okay, that is just wrong.

1546
01:56:32,736 --> 01:56:37,663
There's a whole spectrum
of emotions and motivations.

1547
01:56:38,116 --> 01:56:40,288
And don't say "fuck." It's vulgar.

1548
01:56:40,368 --> 01:56:43,918
Say something else. Like, you know,
"make love," or something. I don't know.

1549
01:56:44,164 --> 01:56:46,167
So, was love fuck?

1550
01:56:49,252 --> 01:56:50,879
Okay, what is this all about?

1551
01:56:54,758 --> 01:56:57,472
You look for me, you want help me,

1552
01:56:57,552 --> 01:56:58,929
you make fuck with me.

1553
01:56:59,304 --> 01:57:01,307
Now you go down stupid hole.

1554
01:57:02,098 --> 01:57:03,725
So I try to think

1555
01:57:04,392 --> 01:57:06,395
what kind of fuck you give me.

1556
01:57:07,395 --> 01:57:10,149
I think maybe pity fuck. For leg.

1557
01:57:10,232 --> 01:57:12,906
No. No. Ngoc Lan,

1558
01:57:13,485 --> 01:57:15,658
I care about you, deeply.

1559
01:57:16,154 --> 01:57:18,498
You are such an extraordinary person,

1560
01:57:18,740 --> 01:57:21,243
and I just admire you so much.

1561
01:57:22,077 --> 01:57:23,670
More than anything.

1562
01:57:24,246 --> 01:57:25,839
I want you to come with me.

1563
01:57:29,543 --> 01:57:31,796
People always say me I strong.

1564
01:57:33,630 --> 01:57:35,724
Okay, maybe Vietnam

1565
01:57:37,008 --> 01:57:39,352
I organize many protest,

1566
01:57:39,553 --> 01:57:43,228
survive two year prison,
punish me make small.

1567
01:57:43,598 --> 01:57:46,192
I only person survive TV box.

1568
01:57:46,560 --> 01:57:50,064
I walk around, no foot.
Take care for other people.

1569
01:57:50,855 --> 01:57:53,700
But I woman. Feeling.

1570
01:57:56,027 --> 01:57:59,031
I'm sorry. I really am.

1571
01:58:00,073 --> 01:58:03,248
It's so easy for me to see who you are.

1572
01:58:04,160 --> 01:58:06,413
But if I don't do this, who am I?

1573
01:58:07,455 --> 01:58:09,549
I mean, really, who am I?

1574
01:58:10,125 --> 01:58:11,968
You Paul Safranek!

1575
01:58:12,544 --> 01:58:14,091
You good man!

1576
01:58:19,801 --> 01:58:21,724
Look, Ngoc Lan, butterflies!

1577
02:00:07,450 --> 02:00:09,293
I guess this is it.

1578
02:00:10,537 --> 02:00:11,709
Konrad.

1579
02:00:12,706 --> 02:00:14,424
Very nice to have met you.

1580
02:00:15,041 --> 02:00:16,543
Pleasure was mine.

1581
02:00:16,960 --> 02:00:18,507
Good luck in there, Paul.

1582
02:00:29,764 --> 02:00:31,641
Take care of yourself.

1583
02:00:32,559 --> 02:00:33,651
I will.

1584
02:00:34,436 --> 02:00:35,563
You, too.

1585
02:00:36,438 --> 02:00:39,066
I will miss my funny neighbor.

1586
02:00:54,956 --> 02:00:56,299
Your Bible.

1587
02:00:59,878 --> 02:01:01,881
But it's in Vietnamese.

1588
02:01:03,339 --> 02:01:05,012
Words not matter.

1589
02:01:06,384 --> 02:01:07,977
Remember me.

1590
02:01:21,357 --> 02:01:22,984
You go away now.

1591
02:02:16,329 --> 02:02:17,330
Excuse me.

1592
02:02:17,413 --> 02:02:21,088
Hi. Is it just me, or are we walking uphill?

1593
02:02:21,584 --> 02:02:23,837
Yes. Prevents flooding.

1594
02:02:24,128 --> 02:02:26,802
- Tunde.
- Hi. Paul.

1595
02:02:28,007 --> 02:02:29,471
It's just a few hours climb

1596
02:02:29,551 --> 02:02:31,349
before we begin the descent to the vault.

1597
02:02:31,678 --> 02:02:33,555
Well, how long is the whole walk?

1598
02:02:33,805 --> 02:02:35,682
Eleven hours, something like that.

1599
02:02:35,974 --> 02:02:38,227
See you down there. Stay hydrated.

1600
02:03:34,574 --> 02:03:36,076
Wait!

1601
02:03:37,577 --> 02:03:38,669
No, wait.

1602
02:03:39,954 --> 02:03:41,422
Thank you so much.

1603
02:03:42,165 --> 02:03:44,213
- Wait, my bag. No, no, no.
- Leave it!

1604
02:03:44,918 --> 02:03:47,637
I told you nothing ever
works out for this guy.

1605
02:03:47,921 --> 02:03:50,094
It's going to blow. Run!

1606
02:03:53,051 --> 02:03:54,052
Paul!

1607
02:03:55,053 --> 02:03:56,271
Ngoc Lan!

1608
02:04:04,812 --> 02:04:06,651
I was thinking about what you were saying.

1609
02:04:06,731 --> 02:04:08,654
And I realized you were right.

1610
02:04:09,233 --> 02:04:10,906
I am Paul Safranek.

1611
02:04:12,111 --> 02:04:13,988
And what you were asking?

1612
02:04:15,239 --> 02:04:17,082
It was a love fuck.

1613
02:05:37,905 --> 02:05:39,407
And to think

1614
02:05:40,658 --> 02:05:43,002
one day, all of this...

1615
02:05:47,290 --> 02:05:51,887
Now maybe you understand little bit
how I feel after survive TV box.

1616
02:05:58,259 --> 02:06:00,603
When you know death come soon,

1617
02:06:01,763 --> 02:06:04,357
you look around things more close.

1618
02:07:10,832 --> 02:07:12,755
Wait here. I'll be right back.

1619
02:07:13,209 --> 02:07:15,963
I want go, too. I want see Rosa new baby.

1620
02:07:16,045 --> 02:07:18,799
No, see the baby tomorrow. It's pouring!

1621
02:07:22,343 --> 02:07:23,344
Hurry.

1622
02:07:23,427 --> 02:07:27,773
Don't forget, we still need go see
Philippine man, take care for his arm.

1623
02:07:28,015 --> 02:07:30,359
I know. Stop obsessing, will you?
