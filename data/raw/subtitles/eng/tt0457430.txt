1
00:00:42,489 --> 00:00:48,860
Spain, 1944

2
00:00:50,063 --> 00:00:51,431
The Civil War is over.

3
00:00:51,431 --> 00:00:53,567
Hidden in the mountains,

4
00:00:53,567 --> 00:00:55,769
armed men are still fighting
the new Fascist regime.

5
00:00:55,769 --> 00:00:58,033
Military posts are established
to exterminate the Resistance.

6
00:01:21,128 --> 00:01:24,928
A long time ago,

7
00:01:27,167 --> 00:01:31,968
in the Underground Realm,
where there are no lies or pain,

8
00:01:33,039 --> 00:01:37,032
there lived a princess who dreamt
of the human world.

9
00:01:39,045 --> 00:01:44,244
She dreamt of blue skies,
soft breeze and sunshine.

10
00:01:49,356 --> 00:01:50,550
One day,

11
00:01:51,291 --> 00:01:54,920
eluding her keepers,
the princess escaped.

12
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,826
Once outside...

13
00:02:03,303 --> 00:02:06,932
the bright sun blinded her
and erased her memory.

14
00:02:09,876 --> 00:02:13,073
She forgot who she was
and where she came from.

15
00:02:13,547 --> 00:02:19,782
Her body suffered cold, sickness and pain.
And eventually she died.

16
00:02:21,121 --> 00:02:23,351
However, her father, the king,

17
00:02:23,657 --> 00:02:26,683
always knew that the Princess' soul
would return,

18
00:02:27,194 --> 00:02:28,661
perhaps in another body,

19
00:02:29,329 --> 00:02:31,854
in another place, at another time.

20
00:02:32,265 --> 00:02:35,792
He would wait for her,
until he drew his last breath,

21
00:02:36,136 --> 00:02:39,435
until the world stopped turning.

22
00:02:48,315 --> 00:02:50,806
Why did you bring
so many books, Ofelia?

23
00:02:50,984 --> 00:02:53,578
We're going to the country,
the outdoors.

24
00:02:59,092 --> 00:03:00,753
Fairy tales?

25
00:03:01,161 --> 00:03:05,257
You're a bit too old to be filling your head
with such nonsense.

26
00:03:08,335 --> 00:03:10,235
Ask him to stop the car.

27
00:03:24,384 --> 00:03:27,217
Ofelia, wait.

28
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,513
Your brother's not well.

29
00:03:32,692 --> 00:03:34,284
Madam, are you okay?

30
00:04:41,127 --> 00:04:42,094
Ofelia?

31
00:04:44,497 --> 00:04:47,398
Ofelia, Come here.

32
00:04:50,604 --> 00:04:53,835
- I saw a fairy.
- Just look at your shoes!

33
00:04:55,075 --> 00:04:56,064
Let's go.

34
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:00,111
When we get to the mill,
come out to greet the Captain.

35
00:05:00,347 --> 00:05:02,178
I want you to call him Father.

36
00:05:02,616 --> 00:05:05,050
You have no idea
how good he's been to us.

37
00:05:06,453 --> 00:05:09,752
It's just a word, Ofelia...
just a word...

38
00:05:35,682 --> 00:05:37,411
They're coming, Captain.

39
00:05:38,418 --> 00:05:39,908
15 minutes late.

40
00:05:57,871 --> 00:05:59,031
Carmen.

41
00:06:06,513 --> 00:06:07,810
Welcome.

42
00:06:12,652 --> 00:06:15,052
That's not necessary.
I can walk perfectly well.

43
00:06:15,522 --> 00:06:17,990
Doctor Ferreiro prefers
that you don't exert yourself.

44
00:06:18,725 --> 00:06:19,555
No.

45
00:06:21,628 --> 00:06:24,597
Come.
Do it for me.

46
00:06:29,836 --> 00:06:30,860
Thank you.

47
00:06:32,772 --> 00:06:33,898
Ofelia, come out.

48
00:06:34,808 --> 00:06:36,002
Say hello to the Captain.

49
00:06:41,081 --> 00:06:42,105
Ofelia.

50
00:06:50,256 --> 00:06:52,451
It's the other hand, Ofelia.

51
00:06:56,396 --> 00:06:57,420
Mercedes!

52
00:06:58,698 --> 00:07:01,531
- Bring the luggage.
- Sir.

53
00:08:07,233 --> 00:08:08,791
It's a labyrinth.

54
00:08:12,338 --> 00:08:14,863
Just a pile of old rocks
that have always been here.

55
00:08:15,608 --> 00:08:17,166
Even before the mill.

56
00:08:18,278 --> 00:08:21,179
Better not to go in there.
You may get lost.

57
00:08:21,815 --> 00:08:23,009
Thank you.

58
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:24,881
Have you read them all?

59
00:08:25,385 --> 00:08:26,317
Mercedes!

60
00:08:28,421 --> 00:08:29,410
The Captain is calling.

61
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:33,084
Your father needs me.

62
00:08:36,029 --> 00:08:37,155
He's not my father.

63
00:08:37,997 --> 00:08:39,589
The Captain is not my father.

64
00:08:39,766 --> 00:08:43,099
My father was a tailor.
He died in the war.

65
00:08:43,236 --> 00:08:44,567
He's not my father.

66
00:08:45,939 --> 00:08:48,407
You've made that clear enough.
Shall we go?

67
00:08:49,242 --> 00:08:50,903
Have you seen my mother?

68
00:08:51,377 --> 00:08:52,969
- Isn't she beautiful!
- Yes.

69
00:08:53,413 --> 00:08:55,779
She's sick with baby.
Did you notice?

70
00:09:13,633 --> 00:09:15,430
The guerrillas are sticking
to the woods

71
00:09:15,735 --> 00:09:17,532
because it's hard
to track them up there.

72
00:09:18,738 --> 00:09:21,002
Those bastards know the terrain
better than any of us.

73
00:09:21,174 --> 00:09:22,835
We'll block all access
to the woods

74
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:27,270
Food, medicine-
we'll store it all. Right here.

75
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,347
We need to force them down,
make them come to us.

76
00:09:30,683 --> 00:09:32,412
We'll set up three
new command posts.

77
00:09:32,585 --> 00:09:36,180
Here, here and here.

78
00:09:36,356 --> 00:09:37,380
Mercedes.

79
00:09:38,658 --> 00:09:41,183
- Ask Dr. Ferreiro to come down.
- Yes, sir.

80
00:09:45,865 --> 00:09:47,992
This will help you sleep
through the night.

81
00:09:49,302 --> 00:09:51,793
Just two drops just before bed.

82
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:56,133
Two drops only.

83
00:09:58,678 --> 00:09:59,508
Very good.

84
00:10:01,447 --> 00:10:03,677
All of it.
Good.

85
00:10:06,185 --> 00:10:09,643
Don't hesitate to call me
if you need anything. Day or night.

86
00:10:12,058 --> 00:10:14,288
You or your nurse.

87
00:10:15,094 --> 00:10:16,083
Good night.

88
00:10:17,297 --> 00:10:19,629
Close the door
and turn off the lights, sweetie.

89
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:33,773
You have to help us.
Come up and see him.

90
00:10:34,013 --> 00:10:37,244
The wound is getting worse.
His leg isn't any better.

91
00:10:41,321 --> 00:10:43,186
This is all I could get.

92
00:10:43,423 --> 00:10:44,412
I'm sorry.

93
00:10:46,292 --> 00:10:48,317
Captain Vidal is waiting
for you in his office.

94
00:11:14,387 --> 00:11:15,820
Come here, Ofelia.

95
00:11:28,034 --> 00:11:31,265
Jesus, your feet.
They're frozen!

96
00:11:41,247 --> 00:11:42,271
Are you afraid?

97
00:11:44,484 --> 00:11:45,508
A little.

98
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:51,716
What's that noise?

99
00:11:51,824 --> 00:11:54,918
Nothing, just the wind.

100
00:11:56,396 --> 00:11:59,593
Nights here are different
from city nights.

101
00:12:00,533 --> 00:12:03,559
There, you hear cars-tramway.

102
00:12:04,103 --> 00:12:05,968
Here the houses are old.

103
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:08,729
They creak.

104
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:12,675
As if they were speaking.

105
00:12:16,716 --> 00:12:19,150
Tomorrow, I'm going
to give you a surprise.

106
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:21,511
- A surprise?
- Yes.

107
00:12:23,056 --> 00:12:27,493
- A book?
- No, something much better.

108
00:12:33,466 --> 00:12:35,434
Why did you have to get married?

109
00:12:39,672 --> 00:12:42,004
I was alone too long.

110
00:12:42,608 --> 00:12:45,736
I'm with you.
You weren't alone.

111
00:12:46,779 --> 00:12:48,269
You were never alone.

112
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:54,481
When you're older, you'll understand.
It hasn't been easy for me either.

113
00:12:58,124 --> 00:13:00,058
Your brother's at it again-

114
00:13:00,927 --> 00:13:03,054
Tell him one of your stories.

115
00:13:03,596 --> 00:13:05,291
I'm sure that'll calm down.

116
00:13:08,267 --> 00:13:11,759
My brother, my brother...

117
00:13:16,909 --> 00:13:19,377
Many, many years ago,

118
00:13:19,745 --> 00:13:22,111
in a sad, faraway land,

119
00:13:22,215 --> 00:13:25,946
there was an enormous mountain
made of rough, black stone.

120
00:13:26,619 --> 00:13:28,280
At sunset,

121
00:13:28,955 --> 00:13:31,219
on top of that mountain,

122
00:13:31,457 --> 00:13:35,894
a magic rose blossomed every night
that made whoever plucked it immortal.

123
00:13:36,229 --> 00:13:39,665
But no one dared go near it

124
00:13:40,133 --> 00:13:43,296
because its thorns were full of poison.

125
00:13:52,612 --> 00:13:57,106
Men talked amongst themselves
about their fear of death,

126
00:13:57,183 --> 00:14:01,813
and pain, but never about the promise
of eternal life.

127
00:14:05,858 --> 00:14:13,731
And every day, the rose wilted
unable to bequeath its gift to anyone.

128
00:14:15,601 --> 00:14:20,197
Forgotten and lost at the top
of that cold, dark mountain,

129
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,934
forever alone, until the end of time.

130
00:14:36,856 --> 00:14:37,788
Come in.

131
00:14:41,294 --> 00:14:43,091
- How is she?
- Very weak.

132
00:14:43,696 --> 00:14:45,061
She'll have as much rest
as as she needs.

133
00:14:45,264 --> 00:14:46,356
I'll sleep down here.

134
00:14:51,537 --> 00:14:53,027
- And my son?
- Pardon?

135
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:55,170
Excuse us, Captain.

136
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:59,269
My son, how is he?

137
00:15:00,046 --> 00:15:01,946
For the moment, there's no
reason to be alarmed.

138
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:05,048
Very good.

139
00:15:06,986 --> 00:15:11,946
Captain, your wife should not have
traveled at such a late stage of pregnancy.

140
00:15:15,127 --> 00:15:18,893
- Is that your opinion?
- My professional opinion, yes, sir.

141
00:15:22,068 --> 00:15:24,502
A son should be born
wherever his father is.

142
00:15:25,004 --> 00:15:26,028
That's all.

143
00:15:28,541 --> 00:15:29,974
One more thing, Captain.

144
00:15:30,977 --> 00:15:33,002
What makes you so sure
the baby is a male?

145
00:15:35,314 --> 00:15:36,281
Don't fuck with me.

146
00:15:38,084 --> 00:15:40,746
At 8 o'clock we detected movement
in the northwestern sector.

147
00:15:41,487 --> 00:15:42,249
Gunfire.

148
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:48,552
Sergeant Bayona searched the area
and captured a suspect.

149
00:15:49,428 --> 00:15:51,259
The other one's his son,
here from the town.

150
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:53,730
Captain, my father
is an honest man.

151
00:15:53,866 --> 00:15:56,858
Let me judge that.
Take your hat off in front of me.

152
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:00,532
We found this weapon on him.
It's been fired.

153
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,435
My father was hunting
rabbits, Captain.

154
00:16:02,508 --> 00:16:04,066
Again, keep quiet.

155
00:16:14,754 --> 00:16:16,415
"No God, no country, no Master"?

156
00:16:16,889 --> 00:16:21,019
- Just like that-how do you like that?
- Red prpaganda, Captain.

157
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,957
It's not propaganda, sir.

158
00:16:23,663 --> 00:16:25,961
It's an old almanac, Captain.

159
00:16:26,999 --> 00:16:28,660
We're just farmers.

160
00:16:30,269 --> 00:16:31,099
Go on.

161
00:16:32,338 --> 00:16:36,104
I went up into the woods, Captain.
To hunt for rabbits.

162
00:16:36,742 --> 00:16:38,869
For my daughters. They're sick.

163
00:16:40,479 --> 00:16:41,946
Rabbits, uh?

164
00:16:42,348 --> 00:16:46,148
Captain, if my father says so,
he was hunting rabbits.

165
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:59,225
Leave him alone.

166
00:17:02,168 --> 00:17:05,433
You killed him,
You killed him!

167
00:17:05,938 --> 00:17:08,930
Murderer!
Son of a bitch!

168
00:17:38,704 --> 00:17:40,865
Maybe you'll learn to search
these assholes properly

169
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:42,698
before you come bothering me.

170
00:17:42,975 --> 00:17:44,135
Yes, Captain.

171
00:18:04,397 --> 00:18:07,833
Mother.
Mother, wake up!

172
00:18:08,334 --> 00:18:11,599
Mother, there's something in the room.

173
00:18:53,012 --> 00:18:53,944
Hello.

174
00:18:54,814 --> 00:18:56,338
Did you follow me here?

175
00:18:57,116 --> 00:18:58,276
Are you a fairy?

176
00:19:00,753 --> 00:19:01,617
Look!

177
00:19:06,959 --> 00:19:08,449
This is a fairy.

178
00:19:36,255 --> 00:19:37,916
You want me to go with you?

179
00:19:39,525 --> 00:19:41,959
Outside? Where?

180
00:20:59,972 --> 00:21:01,633
Hello?

181
00:21:03,008 --> 00:21:04,532
Hello?

182
00:21:22,595 --> 00:21:24,688
Echo.

183
00:21:31,704 --> 00:21:33,729
Echo.

184
00:21:36,609 --> 00:21:38,702
Hello?

185
00:21:41,547 --> 00:21:43,071
Hello?

186
00:21:45,684 --> 00:21:46,981
It's you.

187
00:21:52,124 --> 00:21:55,457
It's you.
You've returned.

188
00:21:55,561 --> 00:21:57,586
Don't be frightened,
I beg you.

189
00:21:58,931 --> 00:22:00,865
Look, look.

190
00:22:09,141 --> 00:22:11,769
My name is Ofelia.
Who are you?

191
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:13,070
Me?

192
00:22:15,648 --> 00:22:18,116
I've had so many names...

193
00:22:18,317 --> 00:22:26,315
Old names that only the wind
and the trees can pronounce.

194
00:22:26,492 --> 00:22:33,330
I am the mountain,
the forest and the earth.

195
00:22:34,133 --> 00:22:35,430
I am...

196
00:22:38,904 --> 00:22:41,702
I am a faun.

197
00:22:42,474 --> 00:22:46,501
Your most humble servant,
Your Highness.

198
00:22:46,645 --> 00:22:50,274
- No, I'm...
- You're Princess Moanna,

199
00:22:50,382 --> 00:22:56,048
daughter of the king
of the underworld.

200
00:22:56,121 --> 00:22:57,850
My father was a tailor.

201
00:22:57,956 --> 00:23:00,083
You are not born of man.

202
00:23:01,126 --> 00:23:03,560
It was the moon that bore you.

203
00:23:03,729 --> 00:23:06,027
Look on your left shoulder

204
00:23:06,198 --> 00:23:09,167
and you will find a mark
that proves it.

205
00:23:09,601 --> 00:23:19,567
Your real father had us open portals
all over the world to allow your return.

206
00:23:20,045 --> 00:23:21,706
This is...

207
00:23:22,347 --> 00:23:24,941
This is the last of them.

208
00:23:25,584 --> 00:23:34,185
But we have to make sure
that your essence is intact,

209
00:23:34,693 --> 00:23:38,823
that you have not become a mortal.

210
00:23:42,401 --> 00:23:48,033
You must complete three tasks
before the moon is full.

211
00:23:50,976 --> 00:23:57,006
This is The Book of Crossroads.

212
00:23:57,716 --> 00:24:00,844
Open it, when you are alone

213
00:24:00,986 --> 00:24:03,887
and it will show you your future,

214
00:24:03,989 --> 00:24:08,323
show you what must be done.

215
00:24:16,702 --> 00:24:18,260
But there's nothing in here.

216
00:25:15,227 --> 00:25:18,788
Mercedes, prepare these rabbits
for dinner tonight.

217
00:25:19,798 --> 00:25:21,823
They are too young.

218
00:25:22,334 --> 00:25:25,394
- Well, maybe they'll do for a stew.
- Yes, sir.

219
00:25:27,873 --> 00:25:30,865
This coffee was burnt.
Taste it yourself.

220
00:25:39,318 --> 00:25:42,151
You should keep an eye on it.

221
00:25:43,956 --> 00:25:45,389
As you wish, sir.

222
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:52,919
Cook these.

223
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:57,168
- He didn't like the coffee.
- He's nothing but a fussy dandy.

224
00:25:57,302 --> 00:25:58,203
A fussy dandy!

225
00:25:58,203 --> 00:26:00,505
We're going to need some beef
and one more chicken.

226
00:26:00,505 --> 00:26:04,339
- Where are we supposed to find that?
- The doctor's wife, the mayor's too.

227
00:26:04,409 --> 00:26:07,401
Well, they eat more
than a couple of pigs.

228
00:26:08,513 --> 00:26:12,074
- And they don't shut up.
- Not even underwater.

229
00:26:27,032 --> 00:26:29,057
I'll be back in a moment,
Mercedes.

230
00:26:34,172 --> 00:26:35,434
Ofelia.

231
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:40,740
Your father is giving
a dinner party tonight.

232
00:26:41,146 --> 00:26:43,979
Look what I've made for you.

233
00:26:45,417 --> 00:26:46,611
Do you like it?

234
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:51,412
What I wouldn't have given
to have such a dress...

235
00:26:51,556 --> 00:26:53,990
as fine as this when I was your age!

236
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:55,285
And look at the shoes!

237
00:26:56,662 --> 00:26:59,358
- Do you like them?
- Yes, very pretty.

238
00:27:00,999 --> 00:27:02,660
Go on, now.
Take your bath.

239
00:28:07,032 --> 00:28:08,021
Ofelia?

240
00:28:09,801 --> 00:28:10,665
Ofelia?

241
00:28:12,104 --> 00:28:15,562
Hurry up.
I want to see the dress on you.

242
00:28:15,841 --> 00:28:18,401
I want you to be beautiful
for the Captain.

243
00:28:21,246 --> 00:28:23,009
You'll look like a princess.

244
00:28:27,419 --> 00:28:28,818
A princess?

245
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,889
Make sure those chickens
are cleaned properly.

246
00:28:36,995 --> 00:28:39,463
And don't forget the beans.

247
00:28:42,701 --> 00:28:47,070
- You look marvelous, my girl, just beautiful.
- What a gorgeous dress!

248
00:28:49,508 --> 00:28:51,999
Get back to work,
stop wasting time.

249
00:28:54,813 --> 00:28:56,280
Do you want some milk with honey?

250
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:05,779
Move back, we can't have you getting
milk on your dress, with you looking so pretty.

251
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:12,096
Mercedes.
Do you believe in fairies?

252
00:29:13,231 --> 00:29:14,129
No.

253
00:29:14,933 --> 00:29:16,298
But when I was a little girl,
I did.

254
00:29:16,368 --> 00:29:18,962
I believed in a lot of things
I don't believe any more.

255
00:29:21,373 --> 00:29:23,102
Last night,
a fairy visited me.

256
00:29:24,109 --> 00:29:25,167
Really?

257
00:29:26,411 --> 00:29:29,548
And it wasn't alone,
there were lots of them,

258
00:29:29,548 --> 00:29:31,243
- And a faun, too.
- A faun?

259
00:29:31,516 --> 00:29:35,475
He was very old, very tall
and smelled like earth.

260
00:29:36,521 --> 00:29:39,547
My mother warned me
to be wary of fauns.

261
00:29:39,791 --> 00:29:40,849
Mercedes!

262
00:29:42,794 --> 00:29:43,761
Come with me.

263
00:29:54,439 --> 00:29:56,236
Captain,
everything is here.

264
00:29:56,475 --> 00:29:59,171
Flour, salt, oil, medicine,

265
00:29:59,344 --> 00:30:02,472
olives, bacon.

266
00:30:03,582 --> 00:30:05,447
This-this is real tobacco.

267
00:30:06,418 --> 00:30:07,817
And the ration cards.

268
00:30:08,186 --> 00:30:10,518
- I need you to check the inventory.
- Very well.

269
00:30:13,992 --> 00:30:15,016
Mercedes.

270
00:30:16,228 --> 00:30:17,923
- The key.
- Yes, sir.

271
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:27,204
- Is this the only copy?
- The only one.

272
00:30:27,305 --> 00:30:29,102
From now on, I'll carry it.

273
00:30:30,041 --> 00:30:30,973
Captain.

274
00:30:36,748 --> 00:30:38,340
Captain,
perhaps it's nothing.

275
00:30:46,758 --> 00:30:47,747
It's them.

276
00:30:59,437 --> 00:31:03,498
"Once upon a time,
when the forest was young,

277
00:31:04,075 --> 00:31:09,707
they were home to creatures
who were full of magic and wonder."

278
00:31:16,521 --> 00:31:18,853
"They protected one another,

279
00:31:19,157 --> 00:31:22,320
and slept in the shade
of a colossal fig tree

280
00:31:22,761 --> 00:31:25,195
that grew on a hill, near the mill."

281
00:31:27,732 --> 00:31:29,495
"But now, the tree is dying.

282
00:31:29,834 --> 00:31:33,497
Its branches are dry,
its trunk old and twisted.

283
00:31:34,306 --> 00:31:37,537
A monstrous toad
has settled in its roots

284
00:31:37,809 --> 00:31:39,276
and won't let the tree thrive.

285
00:31:40,579 --> 00:31:43,776
You must put the three magic
stones in the toad's mouth

286
00:31:44,449 --> 00:31:47,907
and retrieve the golden key
from inside his belly.

287
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:51,683
Only then will the fig tree
flourish again."

288
00:33:18,209 --> 00:33:20,006
They were here
less than twenty minutes ago.

289
00:33:20,812 --> 00:33:22,643
They left in a hurry.

290
00:33:29,788 --> 00:33:31,688
A dozen men, at most.

291
00:33:50,608 --> 00:33:51,973
Antibiotics.

292
00:33:52,944 --> 00:33:56,107
Shit, they forgot this lottery ticket.

293
00:33:58,450 --> 00:33:59,644
They're here.

294
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:04,986
Those sons of bitches are here.

295
00:34:05,857 --> 00:34:07,984
And they're watching us.

296
00:34:17,936 --> 00:34:19,631
Hey!

297
00:34:20,972 --> 00:34:23,463
You left this behind!

298
00:34:24,209 --> 00:34:26,200
And your lottery ticket!

299
00:34:26,745 --> 00:34:28,838
Why don't you come back
and get it?

300
00:34:29,581 --> 00:34:32,049
Who knows?
This could be your lucky day!

301
00:35:43,188 --> 00:35:46,749
Hello.
I'm Princess Moanna,

302
00:35:47,125 --> 00:35:48,592
and I'm not afraid of you.

303
00:35:52,063 --> 00:35:55,294
Aren't you ashamed
living down here,

304
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,525
eating all these bugs...

305
00:35:58,303 --> 00:36:01,238
and growing fat
while the tree dies?

306
00:38:44,135 --> 00:38:46,160
Have you looked in her room?
And the pantry?

307
00:38:46,304 --> 00:38:47,566
Yes, ma'am.

308
00:38:51,175 --> 00:38:52,767
Have you checked the garden?

309
00:38:53,111 --> 00:38:54,908
- And the barn?
- Yes, ma'am.

310
00:38:55,747 --> 00:38:57,339
Where is that girl?

311
00:38:57,415 --> 00:38:58,712
This way, please.

312
00:38:59,751 --> 00:39:02,743
Let me to introduce you
to my wife, Carmen.

313
00:39:04,622 --> 00:39:06,487
- Charmed.
- A pleasure to meet you.

314
00:39:07,091 --> 00:39:10,390
From now on,
one ration card per family.

315
00:39:11,162 --> 00:39:12,129
Take a look.

316
00:39:12,263 --> 00:39:14,458
- One?
- Only one.

317
00:39:15,233 --> 00:39:17,030
Captain, I'm not sure
it'll be enough.

318
00:39:17,101 --> 00:39:18,432
If people are careful,
it should be plenty.

319
00:39:18,503 --> 00:39:21,700
We can't allow anyone to send food
to the guerillas in the mountains.

320
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:25,707
They're losing ground,
and one of them is wounded.

321
00:39:26,577 --> 00:39:29,313
Excuse me, Captain,
how can you be so sure?

322
00:39:29,313 --> 00:39:32,043
We almost got them.
We found this.

323
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:34,078
Antibiotics.

324
00:39:35,319 --> 00:39:37,685
God has already
saved their souls.

325
00:39:37,955 --> 00:39:40,583
What happens to their bodies
hardly matter to Him.

326
00:39:40,758 --> 00:39:43,249
We'll help however we can, Captain.

327
00:39:43,361 --> 00:39:45,522
We know you're not here by choice.

328
00:39:49,901 --> 00:39:50,959
You're wrong about that.

329
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:56,038
I choose to be here because I want
my son to be born in a new, clean Spain.

330
00:39:57,008 --> 00:40:00,102
Because these people
hold the mistaken belief

331
00:40:00,378 --> 00:40:01,936
that we're all equal.

332
00:40:02,547 --> 00:40:04,014
But there's a big difference:

333
00:40:04,615 --> 00:40:07,140
The war is over and we won.

334
00:40:07,752 --> 00:40:10,687
And if we need to kill every one
of these vermin to settle it,

335
00:40:11,689 --> 00:40:13,850
then we'll kill them all,
and that's that.

336
00:40:15,093 --> 00:40:16,617
We're all here by choice.

337
00:40:17,628 --> 00:40:19,823
By choice!

338
00:40:22,734 --> 00:40:25,532
Put the coffee on.
I'm going for more wood.

339
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:27,661
We'll take care of it.

340
00:40:54,665 --> 00:40:55,791
Ofelia?

341
00:41:07,812 --> 00:41:10,679
So, how did you
and the Captain meet?

342
00:41:13,117 --> 00:41:15,915
Ofelia's father used to make
the Captain's uniforms.

343
00:41:16,053 --> 00:41:17,020
Oh, I see...

344
00:41:17,555 --> 00:41:21,753
And after he died,
I went to work at the shop.

345
00:41:21,893 --> 00:41:24,088
A little more than a year ago,

346
00:41:24,996 --> 00:41:28,796
the Captain and I met again.

347
00:41:28,966 --> 00:41:30,456
Curious, isn't it!

348
00:41:30,735 --> 00:41:33,704
I mean, finding each other again?

349
00:41:35,239 --> 00:41:37,901
Oh, yes,
very, very curious.

350
00:41:38,176 --> 00:41:41,873
Please, forgive my wife.
She hasn't been exposed to the world.

351
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:44,610
She thinks these silly stories
are interesting to others.

352
00:41:45,783 --> 00:41:47,307
We understand.

353
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,881
Excuse me, madam
Ofelia is here.

354
00:41:52,623 --> 00:41:54,022
Excuse me.

355
00:42:04,969 --> 00:42:07,164
Have I told you that I was acquainted
with your father, Captain?

356
00:42:08,339 --> 00:42:09,806
No.
I had no idea.

357
00:42:12,543 --> 00:42:14,033
In Morocco.

358
00:42:14,445 --> 00:42:17,414
I knew him only briefly,
but he left a great impression.

359
00:42:17,481 --> 00:42:18,675
An excellent soldier.

360
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:23,450
The men in his battalion said that
when General Vidal died on the battlefield,

361
00:42:24,255 --> 00:42:25,916
he smashed his watch on a rock

362
00:42:26,123 --> 00:42:28,614
so that his son would know
the exact hour and minute of his death.

363
00:42:29,727 --> 00:42:32,059
So he would know
how a brave man dies.

364
00:42:35,132 --> 00:42:37,657
Nonsense.
He didn't own a watch.

365
00:42:39,270 --> 00:42:42,467
What you've done hurts me.

366
00:42:44,008 --> 00:42:46,602
After your bath,
you'll go to bed without supper.

367
00:42:48,613 --> 00:42:49,705
Are you listening?

368
00:42:53,184 --> 00:42:55,948
Sometimes I think
you'll never learn to behave.

369
00:42:56,821 --> 00:42:58,812
You've disappointed me, Ofelia.

370
00:43:00,892 --> 00:43:02,291
And your father, too.

371
00:43:03,761 --> 00:43:05,023
You mean the Captain?

372
00:43:06,163 --> 00:43:07,460
Him more than me.

373
00:43:22,914 --> 00:43:24,347
I've got the key.

374
00:43:28,085 --> 00:43:29,712
Take me to the Labyrinth.

375
00:44:22,974 --> 00:44:23,963
Hello.

376
00:44:25,776 --> 00:44:27,573
I got the key out.

377
00:44:28,646 --> 00:44:33,515
That's me,
and the girl is you.

378
00:44:33,851 --> 00:44:35,045
And the baby?

379
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:38,650
So... you retrieved the key.

380
00:44:41,425 --> 00:44:42,687
I'm glad.

381
00:44:51,335 --> 00:44:55,635
She believed in you
from the very beginning.

382
00:44:56,007 --> 00:44:58,703
She's so glad you succeeded.

383
00:45:04,749 --> 00:45:06,148
Keep the key.

384
00:45:06,584 --> 00:45:09,747
You'll be needing it very soon.

385
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:14,823
And this too?
A piece of chalk.

386
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:19,530
Two tasks remain

387
00:45:19,530 --> 00:45:24,365
and the moon is almost full.

388
00:45:24,468 --> 00:45:26,265
Be patient.

389
00:45:26,537 --> 00:45:35,241
We'll soon stroll through
the seven circular gardens of your palace.

390
00:45:35,346 --> 00:45:37,871
How do I know
that what you say is true?

391
00:45:38,182 --> 00:45:44,121
Why would a poor little faun
like me lie to you?

392
00:46:06,243 --> 00:46:07,437
Proceed.

393
00:46:08,479 --> 00:46:10,913
Have your cards
ready for inspection.

394
00:46:11,148 --> 00:46:13,708
Let's go.
Your name?

395
00:46:17,455 --> 00:46:18,945
Your names, first and last.

396
00:46:19,423 --> 00:46:23,587
Narciso Pena Soriano,
at your service.

397
00:46:27,098 --> 00:46:29,328
This is our daily bread
in Franco's Spain,

398
00:46:29,567 --> 00:46:33,663
kept safe in this mill!
The Reds lie...

399
00:46:34,038 --> 00:46:35,699
because in a united Spain,

400
00:46:35,873 --> 00:46:39,570
there's not a single home
without fire or bread.

401
00:46:53,791 --> 00:46:57,352
Come on, show me
what happens now?

402
00:46:57,862 --> 00:46:58,886
Show me.

403
00:47:36,934 --> 00:47:38,526
Ofelia, help me...

404
00:47:44,375 --> 00:47:46,240
Captain! Captain!

405
00:47:48,812 --> 00:47:50,370
Come quickly.

406
00:47:50,915 --> 00:47:52,212
...because in a united Spain,

407
00:47:52,316 --> 00:47:56,184
there's not a single home
without fire or bread.

408
00:47:56,654 --> 00:47:58,986
This is our daily bread
in Franco's Spain...

409
00:48:01,892 --> 00:48:04,861
Your wife needs
uninterrupted rest.

410
00:48:06,730 --> 00:48:09,631
She'll have to be sedated
most of the time.

411
00:48:11,869 --> 00:48:14,201
The girl should sleep
somewhere else.

412
00:48:15,973 --> 00:48:18,032
I'll stay here until the birth.

413
00:48:18,509 --> 00:48:19,476
Make her well.

414
00:48:20,811 --> 00:48:22,836
I don't care what it costs
or what you need.

415
00:48:27,551 --> 00:48:28,245
Make her well.

416
00:48:49,573 --> 00:48:51,040
Don't worry.

417
00:48:52,209 --> 00:48:54,700
Your mother will get better soon,
you'll see.

418
00:48:58,082 --> 00:48:59,709
Having a baby is complicated.

419
00:49:00,517 --> 00:49:03,680
Then I'll never have one.

420
00:49:16,233 --> 00:49:19,066
You're helping the men
in the woods, aren't you?

421
00:49:30,714 --> 00:49:32,045
Have you told anyone?

422
00:49:33,617 --> 00:49:34,743
No, I haven't.

423
00:49:36,954 --> 00:49:39,047
I don't want anything bad
to happen to you.

424
00:49:49,967 --> 00:49:51,229
Nor I to you.

425
00:49:52,770 --> 00:49:54,897
Do you know a lullaby?

426
00:49:56,874 --> 00:49:58,102
Only one...

427
00:49:59,243 --> 00:50:01,268
but I don't remember the words.

428
00:50:01,578 --> 00:50:05,173
I don't care.
I still want to hear it.

429
00:50:58,535 --> 00:51:01,299
Don't be afraid.
It's only me.

430
00:51:10,247 --> 00:51:12,215
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

431
00:51:13,384 --> 00:51:14,510
Then let's go.

432
00:51:19,523 --> 00:51:20,990
This is sheer madness.

433
00:51:21,358 --> 00:51:23,792
When that man finds out about us,
he'll kill us all.

434
00:51:24,294 --> 00:51:27,422
- Have you thought about that?
- Are you so afraid of him, Doctor?

435
00:51:27,831 --> 00:51:29,799
It's not fear...

436
00:51:30,401 --> 00:51:31,766
at least not for myself.

437
00:51:43,547 --> 00:51:44,946
Pedro!

438
00:51:45,249 --> 00:51:47,683
Pedro, My brother!

439
00:52:04,334 --> 00:52:06,495
You didn't carry out the task.

440
00:52:06,637 --> 00:52:09,936
No, my mother is sick.

441
00:52:11,475 --> 00:52:14,069
That's no excuse
for negligence.

442
00:52:14,344 --> 00:52:19,213
Look...
this is a mandrake root.

443
00:52:19,316 --> 00:52:23,184
A plant that dreamt
of being human.

444
00:52:24,121 --> 00:52:28,785
Put it under your mother's bed

445
00:52:29,159 --> 00:52:32,390
in a bowl of fresh milk.

446
00:52:32,996 --> 00:52:37,956
Each morning,
give it two drops of blood.

447
00:52:38,402 --> 00:52:42,463
Now, we have no time
to waste.

448
00:52:42,773 --> 00:52:45,537
The full moon will be upon us.

449
00:52:47,911 --> 00:52:50,379
Take my pets
to guide you through.

450
00:52:50,981 --> 00:52:56,578
You're going to a very dangerous
place, so be careful.

451
00:52:56,787 --> 00:52:59,551
The thing that slumbers there,

452
00:53:00,457 --> 00:53:02,982
it is not human.

453
00:53:06,830 --> 00:53:11,096
You will see
a sumptuous feast,

454
00:53:11,201 --> 00:53:13,999
but don't eat
or drink anything.

455
00:53:14,204 --> 00:53:18,937
Absolutely nothing.

456
00:53:20,611 --> 00:53:24,138
Your life depends on it.

457
00:53:44,801 --> 00:53:49,761
I've brought some Orujo,
tobacco, cheese.

458
00:53:50,474 --> 00:53:52,840
Mail for Trigo and Piloto.

459
00:53:54,912 --> 00:53:56,880
Let's see how that leg's doing,
Frenchie.

460
00:53:57,447 --> 00:54:00,883
How do you think it's doing?
It's fucked up.

461
00:54:01,351 --> 00:54:02,943
Let's see.

462
00:54:06,023 --> 00:54:09,288
...N- North American,

463
00:54:10,661 --> 00:54:13,323
British and Canadian troops

464
00:54:13,430 --> 00:54:16,957
disembarked on a small beach
in the North of F-F.

465
00:54:17,801 --> 00:54:20,497
- "France", idiot.
- F-f-f-rance.

466
00:54:20,904 --> 00:54:23,395
More than 150,000 soldiers
give us hope...

467
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:28,441
under the command
of General Dwight D. Eisenhower...

468
00:54:28,645 --> 00:54:31,614
Is it really bad, doctor?

469
00:54:32,649 --> 00:54:34,276
Look, Frenchie.

470
00:54:35,552 --> 00:54:37,110
There's no way to save it.

471
00:54:48,999 --> 00:54:52,298
I'll try to make it
in as few cuts as possible.

472
00:55:00,077 --> 00:55:03,478
Wait a second, doctor,
just a second.

473
00:55:38,582 --> 00:55:44,748
"Use the chalk to trace a door
anywhere in your room."

474
00:55:49,926 --> 00:55:53,885
"Once the door's open,
start the hourglass."

475
00:55:56,199 --> 00:55:58,326
"Let the fairies guide you."

476
00:56:03,707 --> 00:56:07,040
"Don't eat or drink anything,
during your stay,

477
00:56:07,277 --> 00:56:11,839
and come back
before the last grain of sand falls."

478
00:58:20,811 --> 00:58:21,835
No...

479
00:58:24,681 --> 00:58:25,875
This other one.

480
01:01:01,771 --> 01:01:03,398
No! No!

481
01:02:19,215 --> 01:02:21,115
We'll soon have reinforcements
from Jaca.

482
01:02:21,551 --> 01:02:25,453
Fifty men or more.
Then we'll go head to head with Vidal.

483
01:02:26,489 --> 01:02:28,980
And then what?

484
01:02:29,692 --> 01:02:33,389
You kill him, they'll send another
just like him. And another...

485
01:02:33,963 --> 01:02:37,194
You're screwed, no guns,
no safe shelter...

486
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:41,532
You need food, medicine.
You must take care of Mercedes.

487
01:02:41,771 --> 01:02:43,500
If you really love her,
you'd cross the border with her.

488
01:02:43,573 --> 01:02:46,007
- This is a lost cause.
- I'm staying here, doctor.

489
01:02:46,342 --> 01:02:47,309
There's no choice.

490
01:02:59,722 --> 01:03:00,882
You have to leave.

491
01:03:02,659 --> 01:03:05,594
Here's the key,
but you can't go down there now.

492
01:03:05,862 --> 01:03:08,092
It's exactly what he expects.

493
01:03:11,267 --> 01:03:12,234
Leave it to me.

494
01:03:16,306 --> 01:03:17,432
I'm a coward.

495
01:03:18,541 --> 01:03:21,066
No, you're not.

496
01:03:22,245 --> 01:03:23,473
Yes, I am.

497
01:03:24,114 --> 01:03:28,551
A coward... for living
next to that son of a bitch,

498
01:03:29,853 --> 01:03:32,651
doing his laundry, making his bed,
feeding him.

499
01:03:36,359 --> 01:03:38,850
What if the doctor's right
and we can't win?

500
01:03:43,166 --> 01:03:45,396
At least we'll make things
harder for that bastard.

501
01:05:40,283 --> 01:05:41,250
Captain Vidal...

502
01:05:43,353 --> 01:05:45,878
Her temperature's down.
I don't know how, but it is.

503
01:05:46,689 --> 01:05:47,621
But she still has a fever?

504
01:05:48,258 --> 01:05:51,159
Yes, but it's a good sign.
Her body is responding.

505
01:05:52,962 --> 01:05:53,929
Listen to me.

506
01:05:54,597 --> 01:05:57,623
If you have to choose,
save the baby.

507
01:05:57,800 --> 01:06:00,325
That boy will bear my name
and my father's name.

508
01:06:00,470 --> 01:06:01,459
Save him.

509
01:06:37,473 --> 01:06:38,440
Brother...

510
01:06:40,443 --> 01:06:41,375
Little brother...

511
01:06:43,613 --> 01:06:45,137
If you can hear me,

512
01:06:46,249 --> 01:06:48,410
things out here aren't too good.

513
01:06:50,286 --> 01:06:52,277
But soon you'll have to come out.

514
01:06:53,556 --> 01:06:55,183
You've made Mama very sick.

515
01:06:57,393 --> 01:07:01,022
I want to ask you one favor
for when you come out,

516
01:07:02,165 --> 01:07:03,291
just one:

517
01:07:04,634 --> 01:07:06,295
Don't hurt her.

518
01:07:07,503 --> 01:07:10,734
You'll meet her,
she's very pretty,

519
01:07:11,574 --> 01:07:13,838
even though sometimes she's sad
for days at a time.

520
01:07:14,944 --> 01:07:16,809
You'll see, when she smiles,

521
01:07:18,414 --> 01:07:19,904
you'll love her.

522
01:07:22,285 --> 01:07:25,584
Listen, if you do what I say,

523
01:07:25,888 --> 01:07:27,446
I'll make you a promise,

524
01:07:28,391 --> 01:07:32,020
I'll take you to my kingdom,
and I'll make you a prince.

525
01:07:33,029 --> 01:07:36,192
I promise you, a prince.

526
01:08:02,859 --> 01:08:05,384
I sounded the whistle,
but they wouldn't move.

527
01:08:05,595 --> 01:08:07,995
I tried to stop, but it was too late.

528
01:08:08,064 --> 01:08:10,498
The fireman and I
jumped outjust in time,

529
01:08:10,733 --> 01:08:12,132
but look at the mess they made.

530
01:08:15,304 --> 01:08:17,033
What did they steal
from the freight cars?

531
01:08:17,540 --> 01:08:19,337
They didn't open a single one.

532
01:08:19,609 --> 01:08:21,042
What the hell are you talking about?

533
01:08:21,177 --> 01:08:23,475
This whole mess...
They didn't open any of the cars.

534
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:27,979
- They didn't take anything.
- Nothing? Are you sure?

535
01:08:28,351 --> 01:08:32,219
God only knows what they wanted,
other than to waste our time.

536
01:08:49,071 --> 01:08:50,834
They came out of nowhere, Captain.

537
01:08:54,177 --> 01:08:57,340
They have grenades,
they went up hill.

538
01:09:02,051 --> 01:09:04,849
Captain, we've surrounded
a small unit that fell behind.

539
01:09:05,087 --> 01:09:06,679
They took cover up on the hill.

540
01:09:41,757 --> 01:09:46,251
Go ahead, Serrano, don't be afraid,
this is the only decent way to die.

541
01:10:29,972 --> 01:10:31,166
Serrano!

542
01:10:48,391 --> 01:10:51,417
Let me see.

543
01:10:56,165 --> 01:10:57,257
Can you talk?

544
01:11:01,671 --> 01:11:02,638
Damn it!

545
01:11:21,223 --> 01:11:23,817
These are useless! They can't talk.

546
01:11:33,135 --> 01:11:35,797
Captain,
this one's still alive.

547
01:11:39,875 --> 01:11:41,240
Shot in the leg.

548
01:11:47,183 --> 01:11:48,548
- What's happened?
- They caught one.

549
01:11:48,651 --> 01:11:51,017
They took one of them alive.
And they're taking him to the storeroom.

550
01:11:56,225 --> 01:11:57,351
Mercedes!

551
01:11:58,194 --> 01:12:00,424
Pedro... Pedro...

552
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:18,847
Mercedes?

553
01:12:19,782 --> 01:12:22,774
- I need to get into the storeroom.
- Not now.

554
01:12:23,285 --> 01:12:24,616
Move away!

555
01:12:51,714 --> 01:12:53,944
That's plenty, dear.

556
01:12:57,520 --> 01:12:59,010
Should I take this up?

557
01:13:18,874 --> 01:13:21,342
Here, half the dose.

558
01:13:21,844 --> 01:13:23,641
I don't think I need it.

559
01:13:23,946 --> 01:13:26,938
I feel better, much better.

560
01:13:27,216 --> 01:13:29,616
I don't understand.
But I'm glad.

561
01:13:32,955 --> 01:13:33,546
Mother...

562
01:13:48,304 --> 01:13:51,068
Damn, this cigarette is good!

563
01:13:51,841 --> 01:13:55,242
Real tobacco hard to find.

564
01:13:56,879 --> 01:13:59,279
G-G-Go to hell.

565
01:14:01,951 --> 01:14:05,944
Damn, Garces. We catch one
and he turns out to be a stutterer.

566
01:14:06,222 --> 01:14:08,349
We'll be here all night.

567
01:14:08,557 --> 01:14:10,525
As long as he talks.

568
01:14:16,398 --> 01:14:18,229
Garces is right.

569
01:14:19,068 --> 01:14:21,366
You'd do better
to tell us everything.

570
01:14:22,071 --> 01:14:25,438
But to make sure it happens,
I brought along a few tools.

571
01:14:27,777 --> 01:14:29,972
Just things you pick up
along the way.

572
01:14:30,179 --> 01:14:32,613
At first, I won't be able to trust you,

573
01:14:33,182 --> 01:14:36,640
but after I use this,
you'll own up to a few things.

574
01:14:38,687 --> 01:14:40,154
When we get to these,

575
01:14:41,190 --> 01:14:44,853
we'll have developed...
how can I put this-?

576
01:14:45,261 --> 01:14:47,855
A closer bond,
much like brothers.

577
01:14:49,298 --> 01:14:50,822
You'll see.

578
01:14:52,835 --> 01:14:54,496
And when we get to this one,

579
01:14:55,871 --> 01:14:58,305
I'll believe anything you tell me.

580
01:15:10,619 --> 01:15:11,916
I'll make you a deal.

581
01:15:11,987 --> 01:15:15,514
If you can count to three
without st-t-tuttering,

582
01:15:15,858 --> 01:15:17,052
you can go.

583
01:15:19,228 --> 01:15:22,163
Don't look at him, look at me.

584
01:15:22,431 --> 01:15:24,194
Above me, there's no one.

585
01:15:24,733 --> 01:15:26,633
- Garces!
- Yes, Captain?

586
01:15:26,902 --> 01:15:30,429
If I say this asshole can leave,
would anybody contradict me?

587
01:15:30,506 --> 01:15:32,133
No one, Captain.
He can leave.

588
01:15:32,875 --> 01:15:37,005
There you have it.
Count to three.

589
01:15:53,395 --> 01:15:56,023
- One.
- Good.

590
01:16:00,269 --> 01:16:01,236
Two.

591
01:16:03,005 --> 01:16:05,906
One more and you will be free.

592
01:16:22,825 --> 01:16:23,792
Shame.

593
01:16:35,704 --> 01:16:39,731
Your mother is much better,
Your Highness.

594
01:16:41,176 --> 01:16:47,240
Surely, you must be relieved.

595
01:16:47,750 --> 01:16:49,843
Yes, thank you.

596
01:16:50,252 --> 01:16:53,710
But things haven't turned out so well.

597
01:16:54,623 --> 01:16:55,715
No?

598
01:16:57,526 --> 01:17:01,155
- I had an accident.
- An accident?

599
01:17:01,330 --> 01:17:02,297
Yes.

600
01:17:11,573 --> 01:17:14,474
- You broke the rules!
- It was only two grapes!

601
01:17:14,576 --> 01:17:16,168
I thought no one would notice.

602
01:17:17,579 --> 01:17:20,673
- We've made a mistake!
- A mistake?

603
01:17:21,417 --> 01:17:25,148
You failed.
You can never return.

604
01:17:25,254 --> 01:17:28,917
- It was an accident!
- You cannot return.

605
01:17:29,024 --> 01:17:32,983
The moon will be full in three days.

606
01:17:33,562 --> 01:17:39,262
Your spirit shall forever remain
among the humans.

607
01:17:39,368 --> 01:17:43,236
You shall age like them,
you shall die like them

608
01:17:43,305 --> 01:17:47,401
and all memory of you
shall fade in time.

609
01:17:47,977 --> 01:17:51,970
And we'll vanish along with it.

610
01:17:52,614 --> 01:17:56,414
You will never see us again.

611
01:18:07,129 --> 01:18:10,860
Good day, doctor.
Sorry to wake you so early,

612
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:13,329
but I think we need your help.

613
01:18:36,658 --> 01:18:38,216
My God, what have you done to him?

614
01:18:38,394 --> 01:18:39,520
Not much.

615
01:18:41,463 --> 01:18:43,260
But things are getting better.

616
01:18:51,173 --> 01:18:55,906
I like having you handy, Doctor.
It has its advantages.

617
01:18:57,446 --> 01:18:58,913
Serrano, stay here.

618
01:18:59,081 --> 01:19:00,139
I talked.

619
01:19:01,550 --> 01:19:02,778
Not much.

620
01:19:05,154 --> 01:19:08,590
- B-b-but I talked.
- I'm sorry.

621
01:19:09,324 --> 01:19:10,916
I'm so sorry.

622
01:19:18,067 --> 01:19:23,198
Kill me.
Kill me now, please.

623
01:19:39,388 --> 01:19:40,980
Son of a bitch.

624
01:20:02,077 --> 01:20:04,011
It'll take away the pain.

625
01:20:10,385 --> 01:20:11,852
It's almost over.

626
01:20:20,596 --> 01:20:21,927
Watch Dr. Ferreiro,

627
01:20:22,064 --> 01:20:23,531
- I'll be right there.
- Yes, Captain.

628
01:20:47,089 --> 01:20:48,681
You're not moving anymore.

629
01:20:50,192 --> 01:20:51,625
Are you sick?

630
01:20:54,830 --> 01:20:57,355
What are you doing down there?

631
01:21:10,946 --> 01:21:12,607
- Call him!
- Who?

632
01:21:12,714 --> 01:21:15,114
Who else, you imbecile?
Ferreiro!

633
01:21:39,208 --> 01:21:41,301
What the hell is this?

634
01:21:44,379 --> 01:21:45,971
No! No, no!

635
01:21:46,215 --> 01:21:49,810
Leave her.
Leave her alone, please!

636
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:54,080
Look at this! Look what she
was hiding under your bed!

637
01:21:54,489 --> 01:21:55,683
What do you think of this?

638
01:22:00,295 --> 01:22:04,789
Ofelia, what is this thing doing
under the bed?

639
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:08,936
It's a magic root
the faun gave me.

640
01:22:09,104 --> 01:22:11,698
This is all because of thatjunk
you let her read.

641
01:22:12,040 --> 01:22:13,007
Look what you've done!

642
01:22:13,141 --> 01:22:17,202
Please, leave us alone.
I'll talk to her, darling.

643
01:22:17,846 --> 01:22:20,781
Fine.
As you wish.

644
01:22:22,584 --> 01:22:25,280
He told me you would get better.
And you did.

645
01:22:25,554 --> 01:22:28,455
Ofelia, you have to listen
to your father.

646
01:22:29,791 --> 01:22:30,883
You have to stop all this.

647
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:34,188
No. I want to leave this place!

648
01:22:34,529 --> 01:22:37,692
Please, take me away from here!
Let's just go, Please!

649
01:22:37,833 --> 01:22:40,131
Things are not that simple.

650
01:22:42,371 --> 01:22:44,202
You're getting older,

651
01:22:45,240 --> 01:22:48,607
soon you'll see that life
isn't like your fairy tales.

652
01:22:49,211 --> 01:22:51,406
The world is a cruel place.

653
01:22:52,781 --> 01:22:56,512
And you'll learn that,
even if it hurts.

654
01:22:58,120 --> 01:23:00,645
- No! No!
- Ofelia!

655
01:23:01,990 --> 01:23:06,950
Magic does not exist.
Not for you, me or anyone else.

656
01:23:18,774 --> 01:23:21,038
Mom! Help!

657
01:23:21,510 --> 01:23:22,943
Help!

658
01:23:23,812 --> 01:23:25,074
Help!

659
01:23:31,119 --> 01:23:32,086
Why did you do it?

660
01:23:34,423 --> 01:23:36,084
It was the only thing I could do.

661
01:23:37,426 --> 01:23:39,656
No. You could have obeyed me.

662
01:23:41,430 --> 01:23:43,694
I could have, but I didn't.

663
01:23:45,634 --> 01:23:48,159
It would have been better for you.
You know it.

664
01:23:49,571 --> 01:23:52,540
I don't understand.
Why didn't you obey me?

665
01:23:52,841 --> 01:23:58,973
To obey-just like that-for the sake
of obeying, without questioning...

666
01:24:00,716 --> 01:24:03,708
that's something only people
like you can do, Captain.

667
01:24:41,156 --> 01:24:42,487
Captain!

668
01:24:48,797 --> 01:24:51,163
Garces! Call the troop paramedic.

669
01:24:51,366 --> 01:24:53,857
- Get up immediately!
- Yes, Captain.

670
01:25:28,503 --> 01:25:30,368
Your wife is dead.

671
01:25:40,048 --> 01:25:43,540
Because the paths to the Lord
are inscrutable.

672
01:25:44,019 --> 01:25:45,884
Because the essence
of His forgiveness

673
01:25:45,954 --> 01:25:49,287
lies in His word
and in His mystery.

674
01:25:50,158 --> 01:25:53,150
Because although God
sends us the message,

675
01:25:53,295 --> 01:25:55,923
it is our task to decipher it.

676
01:25:56,798 --> 01:25:58,629
Because when we open our arms

677
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:03,669
the earth takes in only a hollow
and senseless shell.

678
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:07,975
Far away now is the soul
in its eternal glory.

679
01:26:08,577 --> 01:26:12,240
Because it is in pain
that we find the meaning of life.

680
01:26:13,048 --> 01:26:15,983
And the state of grace
that we lose when we are born.

681
01:26:17,319 --> 01:26:22,586
Because God, in His infinite wisdom,
puts the solution in our hands.

682
01:26:26,661 --> 01:26:29,152
And because it is only
in His physical absence,

683
01:26:29,331 --> 01:26:33,597
that the place He occupies
in our souls is reaffirmed.

684
01:26:55,557 --> 01:26:59,049
You knew
Dr. Ferreiro pretty well,
didn't you, Mercedes?

685
01:27:00,128 --> 01:27:03,063
We all knew him, sir.
Everyone around here.

686
01:27:05,033 --> 01:27:08,662
The stutterer spoke of an informer.
Here... at the mill.

687
01:27:09,838 --> 01:27:13,706
Can you imagine?
Right under my nose.

688
01:27:15,544 --> 01:27:18,980
Mercedes, please.

689
01:27:28,723 --> 01:27:30,156
What must you think of me?

690
01:27:31,426 --> 01:27:33,018
You must think that
I'm a monster.

691
01:27:33,562 --> 01:27:36,463
It doesn't matter
what someone like me thinks, sir.

692
01:27:46,641 --> 01:27:49,542
I want you to the storehouse
and bring me some more liquor, please.

693
01:27:49,811 --> 01:27:53,008
Yes, sir.
Goodnight, sir.

694
01:27:53,582 --> 01:27:57,541
Mercedes,
aren't you forgetting something?

695
01:27:58,587 --> 01:27:59,576
Sir?

696
01:28:04,626 --> 01:28:05,524
The key.

697
01:28:06,561 --> 01:28:08,893
I do have the only copy, don't I?

698
01:28:10,098 --> 01:28:11,087
Yes, sir.

699
01:28:12,634 --> 01:28:16,627
You know, there's an odd detail
that's been bothering me.

700
01:28:16,972 --> 01:28:18,906
Maybe it's not important, but...

701
01:28:19,174 --> 01:28:20,766
the day they broke into
the storehouse,

702
01:28:21,009 --> 01:28:23,341
with all those grenades
and explosives,

703
01:28:24,245 --> 01:28:25,735
the lock itself wasn't forced.

704
01:28:28,049 --> 01:28:31,644
As I said, it's probably
not important.

705
01:28:35,256 --> 01:28:36,553
Be very careful.

706
01:28:38,660 --> 01:28:39,888
Good night, sir.

707
01:29:22,737 --> 01:29:25,501
Ofelia, Ofelia!

708
01:29:25,774 --> 01:29:27,799
Ofelia, I'm leaving tonight.

709
01:29:28,343 --> 01:29:31,835
- Where to?
- I can't tell you. I can't tell you...

710
01:29:31,946 --> 01:29:34,972
- Take me with you.
- No, no. I can't.

711
01:29:35,083 --> 01:29:38,109
I can't, my child. But I'll come
back for you, I promise.

712
01:29:38,253 --> 01:29:39,379
Take me with you.

713
01:30:04,279 --> 01:30:05,576
I heard something.

714
01:30:10,552 --> 01:30:13,715
It's nothing, don't worry.

715
01:30:23,064 --> 01:30:24,053
Mercedes.

716
01:30:26,234 --> 01:30:27,201
Ofelia.

717
01:30:36,211 --> 01:30:37,838
How long have
you known about her?

718
01:30:43,251 --> 01:30:44,809
How long have you been
laughing at me?

719
01:30:45,053 --> 01:30:46,247
Little bitch!

720
01:30:47,589 --> 01:30:48,851
Watch her!

721
01:30:52,327 --> 01:30:54,056
And if anyone tries to get in,

722
01:30:55,029 --> 01:30:56,621
kill her first.

723
01:31:10,945 --> 01:31:11,912
Dry meat.

724
01:31:15,517 --> 01:31:16,506
Tobacco.

725
01:31:17,819 --> 01:31:20,583
If you had asked for it, I would have
given this to you, Mercedes.

726
01:31:27,796 --> 01:31:30,026
I want the names of whoever
wrote these letters.

727
01:31:31,766 --> 01:31:33,927
And I want them
in front of me, tomorrow.

728
01:31:34,302 --> 01:31:35,326
Yes, Captain.

729
01:31:38,206 --> 01:31:39,673
You can go, Garces.

730
01:31:41,242 --> 01:31:42,641
You're sure, Captain?

731
01:31:45,079 --> 01:31:47,843
For God's sake,
she's just a woman.

732
01:31:51,820 --> 01:31:53,981
That's what you've always thought.

733
01:31:55,156 --> 01:31:57,954
That's why I was able to get away with it.

734
01:31:58,193 --> 01:32:02,857
- I was invisible to you.
- Damn.

735
01:32:03,698 --> 01:32:07,498
You've found my weakness:
Pride.

736
01:32:08,903 --> 01:32:12,236
But it's your weak points
we're interested in.

737
01:32:14,609 --> 01:32:17,544
It's very simple: You will talk...

738
01:32:19,247 --> 01:32:20,271
And I have to know

739
01:32:22,250 --> 01:32:23,547
that everything you say is the truth.

740
01:32:24,786 --> 01:32:29,052
We have a few things here
strictly for that purpose.

741
01:32:30,992 --> 01:32:32,254
Nothing complicated.

742
01:32:35,096 --> 01:32:36,620
Things we learn on the job.

743
01:32:38,733 --> 01:32:40,701
At first...

744
01:32:57,819 --> 01:33:01,050
I'm not some old man!
Not a wounded prisoner!

745
01:33:01,122 --> 01:33:05,183
Mother Fucker!
Don't you dare touch the girl?

746
01:33:05,426 --> 01:33:07,189
Won't be the first pig I gutted.

747
01:33:30,685 --> 01:33:31,777
Look! He let her go.

748
01:33:34,289 --> 01:33:35,586
The fuck did you say?

749
01:33:43,598 --> 01:33:46,294
Get her!
Come on! Bring her to me!

750
01:33:46,734 --> 01:33:48,565
Bring her to me, damn it!

751
01:33:48,703 --> 01:33:50,193
Mount up!

752
01:34:53,134 --> 01:34:55,625
Lt'll be better if you come
with me without struggling.

753
01:34:56,270 --> 01:34:58,295
The Captain said that if you behave...

754
01:35:02,944 --> 01:35:04,707
Don't be a fool, sweetheart.

755
01:35:05,079 --> 01:35:06,637
If anyone's going to kill you...

756
01:35:08,750 --> 01:35:09,944
I'd rather it be me.

757
01:36:20,321 --> 01:36:25,258
I've decided to give you
one last chance.

758
01:36:30,531 --> 01:36:32,226
Do you promise to do what I say?

759
01:36:34,235 --> 01:36:38,467
Will you do everything I tell you,
without question?

760
01:36:40,274 --> 01:36:43,243
This is your last chance.

761
01:36:44,378 --> 01:36:47,506
Then listen to me.

762
01:36:47,949 --> 01:36:50,349
Fetch your brother

763
01:36:50,751 --> 01:36:53,413
and bring him to the labyrinth,

764
01:36:53,554 --> 01:36:57,957
as quickly as you can,
Your Highness.

765
01:36:58,192 --> 01:36:59,523
My brother?

766
01:36:59,760 --> 01:37:01,091
We need him.

767
01:37:01,229 --> 01:37:04,289
- But...
- No more questions.

768
01:37:07,301 --> 01:37:08,859
The door's locked.

769
01:37:09,871 --> 01:37:15,776
In that case,
create your own door.

770
01:40:04,412 --> 01:40:05,845
Captain, with your permission.

771
01:40:09,216 --> 01:40:10,240
Come quickly.

772
01:40:11,018 --> 01:40:14,283
- Now what?
- Serrano is back. He's wounded.

773
01:40:15,256 --> 01:40:16,621
Wounded?

774
01:41:02,837 --> 01:41:04,236
Where's Garces?

775
01:41:11,712 --> 01:41:12,701
How many were there?

776
01:41:13,247 --> 01:41:15,477
I don't know exactly, Captain.

777
01:41:15,916 --> 01:41:17,406
Fifty men, at least.

778
01:41:17,518 --> 01:41:21,113
The rest of the men didn't make it.
Our watch posts are not responding.

779
01:41:21,255 --> 01:41:24,850
- How many men we have left?
- Twenty, maybe less, sir.

780
01:41:35,669 --> 01:41:39,036
We're leaving.
Together.

781
01:41:40,074 --> 01:41:41,336
Don't be afraid.

782
01:41:42,209 --> 01:41:43,870
Nothing is going to happen to you.

783
01:41:50,251 --> 01:41:51,878
Put them on picket duty
at the tree line.

784
01:41:52,019 --> 01:41:54,146
If the rest of the squad gets back,
have it report immediately to me.

785
01:41:54,388 --> 01:41:57,880
Radio for reinforcements, now.

786
01:41:58,058 --> 01:41:59,355
Yes, Captain.

787
01:42:26,187 --> 01:42:27,415
Leave him!

788
01:43:13,501 --> 01:43:14,763
Ofelia!

789
01:44:41,922 --> 01:44:44,618
Quickly, Your Majesty,

790
01:44:44,892 --> 01:44:47,417
give him to me.

791
01:44:47,962 --> 01:44:51,056
The full moon is high in the sky,

792
01:44:51,165 --> 01:44:53,998
we can open the portal.

793
01:44:54,902 --> 01:44:56,529
Why is that in your hand?

794
01:44:58,038 --> 01:45:02,941
The portal will only open
if we offer the blood of an innocent.

795
01:45:03,243 --> 01:45:07,680
Just a drop of blood.
A pinprick, that's all.

796
01:45:07,781 --> 01:45:10,375
It's the final task.

797
01:45:10,684 --> 01:45:12,015
Hurry.

798
01:45:14,722 --> 01:45:17,816
You promised to obey me!

799
01:45:18,258 --> 01:45:20,488
- Give me the boy!
- No!

800
01:45:21,095 --> 01:45:23,222
My brother stays with me.

801
01:45:23,464 --> 01:45:29,369
You would give up your sacred rights
for this brat you barely know?

802
01:45:29,436 --> 01:45:32,234
Yes, I would.

803
01:45:33,540 --> 01:45:36,008
You would give up
your throne for him?

804
01:45:36,143 --> 01:45:40,739
He who has caused you
such misery, such humiliation?

805
01:45:41,281 --> 01:45:44,148
Yes, I would.

806
01:45:48,255 --> 01:45:53,955
As you wish, Your Highness.

807
01:46:09,677 --> 01:46:10,701
No!

808
01:47:09,403 --> 01:47:10,392
My son.

809
01:47:37,998 --> 01:47:39,659
Tell my son...

810
01:47:45,506 --> 01:47:47,599
Tell him what time his father died.

811
01:47:48,408 --> 01:47:49,705
- Tell him that I...
- No.

812
01:47:50,911 --> 01:47:52,674
He won't even know your name.

813
01:49:35,515 --> 01:49:37,540
Arise, my daughter.

814
01:49:40,854 --> 01:49:42,116
Come.

815
01:50:08,348 --> 01:50:09,576
Father.

816
01:50:10,083 --> 01:50:13,712
You have spilled your own blood
rather than that of an innocent.

817
01:50:14,488 --> 01:50:18,322
That was the final task,
and the most important.

818
01:50:28,835 --> 01:50:34,102
And you chose well,
Your Highness.

819
01:50:34,341 --> 01:50:36,002
Come here with me,

820
01:50:36,877 --> 01:50:39,004
and sit by your father's side.

821
01:50:39,479 --> 01:50:41,674
He's been waiting for you so long.

822
01:51:34,601 --> 01:51:38,367
And it is said the princess
returned to her father's kingdom.

823
01:51:39,306 --> 01:51:44,642
That she reigned there with justice
and a kind heart for many centuries.

824
01:51:45,545 --> 01:51:47,809
That she was loved by her people.

825
01:51:48,081 --> 01:51:52,780
And that she left behind
small traces of her time on earth,

826
01:51:53,887 --> 01:51:58,722
visible only to those
who know where to look.
