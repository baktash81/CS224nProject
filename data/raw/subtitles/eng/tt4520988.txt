00:00:58,358 --> 00:01:00,027
Anna. Elsa.

3
00:01:00,161 --> 00:01:01,361
Bedtime soon.

4
00:01:01,494 --> 00:01:03,231
Uh-oh. The princess
is trapped

5
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:04,798
in the snow goblin's
evil spell.

6
00:01:04,932 --> 00:01:07,601
Quick, Elsa! Make a prince!
A fancy one!

7
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:09,837
Oh, no! The prince
is trapped, too.

8
00:01:09,971 --> 00:01:11,671
Who cares about danger

9
00:01:11,806 --> 00:01:12,706
when there's love?

10
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,641
Ugh, Anna. Bleugh!

11
00:01:14,774 --> 00:01:16,443
Kissing won't save
the Forest.

12
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:18,946
The lost fairies cry out.

13
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:21,381
What sound
does a giraffe make?

14
00:01:21,514 --> 00:01:22,482
Never mind.

15
00:01:22,616 --> 00:01:23,750
They wake
the fairy queen...

16
00:01:23,885 --> 00:01:26,620
who breaks the spell
and saves everyone!

17
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:29,056
And they all get married!

18
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:30,324
What are you playing?

19
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:32,026
Enchanted Forest.

20
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,560
The prince
and the princess...

21
00:01:33,693 --> 00:01:35,762
Hmm. That's like no enchanted
forest I've ever seen.

22
00:01:35,897 --> 00:01:38,698
You've seen
an enchanted forest?

23
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:39,834
Wait, what?

24
00:01:39,967 --> 00:01:41,701
I have. Once.

25
00:01:41,836 --> 00:01:44,404
And you've never
told us this before?

26
00:01:44,537 --> 00:01:46,640
Well, I could
tell you now, if you...

27
00:01:48,142 --> 00:01:49,844
- Okay. Now.
- Tell us now.

28
00:01:49,977 --> 00:01:51,511
Are you sure about this?

29
00:01:52,046 --> 00:01:53,713
It's time they know.

30
00:01:53,848 --> 00:01:55,415
Let's make
a big snowman later.

31
00:01:55,548 --> 00:01:57,084
If they can settle
and listen.

32
00:02:00,154 --> 00:02:01,289
Far away...

33
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:03,291
as north as we can go...

34
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:07,460
stood a very old
and very enchanted forest.

35
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:09,030
But its magic wasn't that of

36
00:02:09,163 --> 00:02:11,765
goblin spells
and lost fairies.

37
00:02:11,899 --> 00:02:14,969
<i>It was protected by the most
powerful spirits of all...</i>

38
00:02:16,037 --> 00:02:17,171
<i>those of air...</i>

39
00:02:17,905 --> 00:02:18,906
<i>of fire...</i>

40
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:21,142
<i>of water...</i>

41
00:02:22,076 --> 00:02:23,743
<i>and earth.</i>

42
00:02:28,682 --> 00:02:29,817
<i>But it was also home</i>

43
00:02:29,951 --> 00:02:32,219
<i>to the mysterious
Northuldra people.</i>

44
00:02:32,353 --> 00:02:34,754
<i>Were the
Northuldra magical, like me?</i>

45
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:37,524
<i>No, Elsa.
They were not magical.</i>

46
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:41,028
<i>They just took advantage
of the Forest's gifts.</i>

47
00:02:41,963 --> 00:02:44,698
<i>Their ways
were so different from ours...</i>

48
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:47,667
<i>but still,
they promised us friendship.</i>

49
00:02:48,235 --> 00:02:49,403
<i>In honor of that,</i>

50
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:51,372
<i>your grandfather,
King Runeard,</i>

51
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,007
<i>built them a mighty dam...</i>

52
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,976
<i>to strengthen their waters.</i>

53
00:02:55,109 --> 00:02:56,410
<i>It was a gift of peace.</i>

54
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:59,013
<i>That's a big gift of peace.</i>

55
00:02:59,146 --> 00:03:00,381
<i>And I was so honored</i>

56
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,383
<i>to get to go to the Forest
to celebrate it.</i>

57
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:03,851
Stand tall, Agnarr.

58
00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:06,187
<i>I wasn't
at all prepared</i>

59
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,022
<i>for what the day would bring.</i>

60
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,026
<i>We let down our guard.</i>

61
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:15,495
<i>We were charmed.</i>

62
00:03:15,896 --> 00:03:16,964
Whoa. Whoa!

63
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:20,167
<i>It felt so...</i>

64
00:03:20,301 --> 00:03:21,501
<i>magical.</i>

65
00:03:35,749 --> 00:03:37,550
<i>But something went wrong.</i>

66
00:03:40,054 --> 00:03:41,288
<i>They were attacking us.</i>

67
00:03:42,056 --> 00:03:43,190
Get behind me.

68
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:46,693
<i>It was
a brutal battle.</i>

69
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:49,130
<i>Your grandfather...</i>

70
00:03:49,263 --> 00:03:50,197
Father!

71
00:03:50,331 --> 00:03:51,265
<i>...was lost.</i>

72
00:03:51,399 --> 00:03:52,599
Aah!

73
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,701
<i>The fighting
enraged the spirits.</i>

74
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:56,937
Look out!

75
00:03:57,071 --> 00:03:59,273
<i>They turned
their magic against us all.</i>

76
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:11,318
<i>There was this voice...</i>

77
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:18,625
<i>...and someone saved me.</i>

78
00:04:21,128 --> 00:04:25,099
<i>I'm told the spirits
then vanished.</i>

79
00:04:25,232 --> 00:04:29,103
<i>And a powerful mist
covered the Forest.</i>

80
00:04:29,236 --> 00:04:31,372
<i>Locking everyone out.</i>

81
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:40,780
And that night, I came home
King of Arendelle.

82
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:46,187
Whoa, Papa, that was epic.

83
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,322
Whoever saved you,

84
00:04:48,456 --> 00:04:50,458
I love them.

85
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,692
I wish I knew
who it was.

86
00:04:52,827 --> 00:04:54,594
What happened to the spirits?

87
00:04:54,727 --> 00:04:56,197
What's in the Forest now?

88
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:57,764
I don't know.

89
00:04:57,898 --> 00:05:00,367
The mist
still stands.

90
00:05:00,501 --> 00:05:02,303
No one
can get in.

91
00:05:02,436 --> 00:05:04,205
And no one
has since come out.

92
00:05:04,338 --> 00:05:05,672
So we're safe.

93
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:06,739
Yes.

94
00:05:06,874 --> 00:05:08,442
But the Forest
could wake again.

95
00:05:08,576 --> 00:05:12,645
And we must be prepared for
whatever danger it may bring.

96
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:13,948
And on that note,

97
00:05:14,081 --> 00:05:15,583
how about we say good night
to your father?

98
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:19,286
But I still
have so many questions.

99
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,988
Save them
for another night, Anna.

100
00:05:21,122 --> 00:05:24,091
You know I don't
have that kind of patience.

101
00:05:25,226 --> 00:05:27,928
Why did Northuldra
attack us anyway?

102
00:05:28,062 --> 00:05:29,997
Who attacks people
who give them gifts?

103
00:05:30,131 --> 00:05:33,100
Do you think the
Forest will wake again?

104
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:37,304
Only Ahtohallan knows.

105
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:39,340
Octa-who-what?

106
00:05:41,408 --> 00:05:43,676
When I was little...

107
00:05:43,811 --> 00:05:44,945
my mother
would sing a song

108
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:47,982
about a special river
called Ahtohallan...

109
00:05:48,115 --> 00:05:51,218
that was said to hold all
the answers about the past.

110
00:05:51,352 --> 00:05:53,087
About what we are
a part of.

111
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,155
Wow.

112
00:05:54,288 --> 00:05:56,423
Will you sing it
for us? Please?

113
00:05:58,092 --> 00:05:58,993
Okay.

114
00:05:59,126 --> 00:06:00,828
Cuddle close.

115
00:06:00,961 --> 00:06:03,297

Excuse me.

142
00:07:58,512 --> 00:08:00,247
I'm coming.

143
00:08:04,051 --> 00:08:05,319
Do you hear that?

144
00:08:05,452 --> 00:08:06,453
What?

145
00:08:08,522 --> 00:08:09,556
Never mind.

146
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:32,246
Enjoying
your new permafrost, Olaf?

147
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:35,282
I'm just living
the dream, Anna.

148
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:36,417
How I wish

149
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:38,085
- this could last forever.
- Mmm.

150
00:08:39,053 --> 00:08:41,488
And yet, change mocks us
with her beauty.

151
00:08:41,622 --> 00:08:42,856
What's that?

152
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:44,658
Forgive me.
Maturity is making me poetic.

153
00:08:46,093 --> 00:08:47,728
Tell me, you're older
and thus all-knowing...

154
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,830
do you ever worry
about the notion that...

155
00:08:49,963 --> 00:08:51,699
nothing is permanent?

156
00:08:51,832 --> 00:08:53,567
Uh... No.

157
00:08:53,701 --> 00:08:54,902
Really?

158
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:57,671
Wow, I can't wait until
I'm ancient like you...

159
00:08:57,806 --> 00:09:00,841
so I don't have to worry
about important things.

160
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:02,710
That's not what I mean.

161
00:09:02,843 --> 00:09:04,745
I don't worry because...

162
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:08,549
well, I have you and Elsa
and Kristoff and Sven...

163
00:09:08,682 --> 00:09:11,018

164
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:12,853

247
00:13:21,335 --> 00:13:22,937
Doesn't matter. This is gonna
be a cinch.

248
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:25,706
Two sisters, one mind.

249
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,307
- Thank you.
- Okay.

250
00:13:27,441 --> 00:13:28,810
Here we go.

251
00:13:28,943 --> 00:13:30,644
You got this, Elsa.

252
00:13:30,777 --> 00:13:32,646
- Hmm.
- Anytime.

253
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:33,948
Just do it with your body.

254
00:13:34,082 --> 00:13:35,182
Uh, nothing?

255
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:37,819
Air? Tree? People?

256
00:13:37,952 --> 00:13:39,219
Treeple? Oh,
that's not a word.

257
00:13:39,353 --> 00:13:41,121
Oh, shovel boy? Teeth?

00:13:41,254 --> 00:13:42,289

259
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:43,557
- Polar bear?
- Hey.

260
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:44,826
- Sorry.
- Uh... Ugh.

261
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:45,960
You gotta
give me something.

262
00:13:46,094 --> 00:13:48,096
Um...

263
00:13:48,228 --> 00:13:50,064
Oh! Uh, alarmed?

264
00:13:50,197 --> 00:13:51,899
Distracted?

265
00:13:52,033 --> 00:13:54,368
Um, worried? Panicking?
Disturbed?

266
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:55,803
Oh, come on,
you definitely

267
00:13:55,937 --> 00:13:57,404
look disturbed.

268
00:13:57,537 --> 00:13:58,672
We won.

269
00:13:58,806 --> 00:14:00,240
Rematch?

270
00:14:00,374 --> 00:14:02,877
Oh, you know what?
I think I'll turn in.

271
00:14:03,011 --> 00:14:04,012
Are you okay?

272
00:14:04,144 --> 00:14:06,346
Just...
Just tired.

273
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,514
Good night.

274
00:14:07,648 --> 00:14:09,050
Yeah, I'm tired, too.

275
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:11,151
And Sven promised
to read me a bedtime story.

276
00:14:11,284 --> 00:14:12,954
Didn't you, Sven?

277
00:14:13,087 --> 00:14:14,022
Did I?

278
00:14:14,154 --> 00:14:16,189
Oh, you do
the best voices!

279
00:14:16,323 --> 00:14:18,692
Like when you pretend to be
Kristoff, and you're like...

280
00:14:18,826 --> 00:14:20,828
"I just
need to go talk to some rocks

281
00:14:20,962 --> 00:14:22,162
"about my childhood
and stuff."

282
00:14:22,295 --> 00:14:23,898
Um, how about you guys

283
00:14:24,032 --> 00:14:25,732
start without me?

284
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:32,172
Ugh.

285
00:14:32,305 --> 00:14:34,142
Did Elsa seem weird
to you?

286
00:14:34,274 --> 00:14:36,978
- She seemed like Elsa.
- Hmm.

287
00:14:37,111 --> 00:14:38,378
That last word

288
00:14:38,512 --> 00:14:40,447
really seemed to throw her.
What was it?

289
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,150
- I don't know. Ahem.
- No. No.

290
00:14:42,282 --> 00:14:43,951
- I don't know, but...
- Ah.

291
00:14:44,618 --> 00:14:45,419
"Ice"?

292
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:47,121
Oh, come on!

293
00:14:47,254 --> 00:14:49,189
She couldn't act out ice?

294
00:14:49,322 --> 00:14:50,958
- I better go check on her.
- Uh...

295
00:14:51,092 --> 00:14:52,927
- Thanks, honey. Love you.
- Hmm?

296
00:14:55,195 --> 00:14:56,831
Love you, too.

297
00:14:58,066 --> 00:14:59,733
It's fine.

298
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:03,938
Come in.

299
00:15:05,439 --> 00:15:07,141
Yep. Something's wrong.

300
00:15:07,274 --> 00:15:09,043
- With you?
- No, with you.

301
00:15:09,177 --> 00:15:11,045
You're wearing
Mother's scarf.

302
00:15:11,179 --> 00:15:13,081
You do that
when something's wrong.

303
00:15:13,213 --> 00:15:15,083
Did we hurt
your feelings?

304
00:15:15,215 --> 00:15:16,550
I'm so sorry if we did.

305
00:15:16,683 --> 00:15:18,986
You know, very few people are
actually good at family games.

306
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,054
That's just a fact.

307
00:15:20,188 --> 00:15:22,522
No, that's not it.

308
00:15:22,656 --> 00:15:24,224
Then, what is it?

309
00:15:26,727 --> 00:15:28,395
There's this...

310
00:15:31,665 --> 00:15:34,001

mess things up.

What things?
You're doing great.

312
00:15:37,004 --> 00:15:40,240
Oh, Elsa,
when are you going to see yourself

313
00:15:40,373 --> 00:15:41,809
the way I see you?

314
00:15:44,178 --> 00:15:45,847
What would I do without you?

315
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:48,315
You'll always have me.

316
00:15:50,218 --> 00:15:51,251

317
00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:52,686

368
00:20:10,277 --> 00:20:13,314
Air, fire, water, earth.

369
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:31,198
The water!

370
00:20:39,407 --> 00:20:42,276
The air rages,
no fire, no water.

371
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:43,878
The earth is next.

372
00:20:44,011 --> 00:20:45,012
We have to get out.

373
00:20:53,054 --> 00:20:56,556
It'll be okay.
Evacuate to the cliffs.

374
00:21:01,262 --> 00:21:02,830
Oh, no!
I'm gonna blow!

375
00:21:02,963 --> 00:21:04,564
I've got you!

376
00:21:12,672 --> 00:21:14,909
Yes.
Everyone's out and safe.

377
00:21:15,042 --> 00:21:17,311
- Here. Take one of these.
- Huh?

378
00:21:17,445 --> 00:21:18,578
You okay there, Olaf?

379
00:21:18,711 --> 00:21:20,381
Oh, yeah.
We're calling this...

380
00:21:20,514 --> 00:21:24,251
"controlling what you can when
things feel out of control."

381
00:21:24,385 --> 00:21:25,652
Okay, I don't understand.

382
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:27,321
You've been hearing
a voice

383
00:21:27,455 --> 00:21:29,290
and you didn't think
to tell me?

384
00:21:29,423 --> 00:21:30,723
I didn't want to worry you.

385
00:21:30,858 --> 00:21:33,660
We made a promise not
to shut each other out.

386
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:37,998
Just tell me
what's going on.

387
00:21:38,132 --> 00:21:41,435
I woke the magical spirits
at the Enchanted Forest.

388
00:21:41,569 --> 00:21:42,635
Okay, that's
definitely not

389
00:21:42,769 --> 00:21:44,271
what I thought
you were gonna say.

390
00:21:44,405 --> 00:21:46,841
Wait. The Enchanted Forest?

391
00:21:46,974 --> 00:21:48,809
The one
Father warned us about?

392
00:21:48,943 --> 00:21:49,676
Yes.

393
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:51,245
Why would you do that?

394
00:21:51,378 --> 00:21:53,646
Because of the voice.

395
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:56,584
I know it sounds crazy...

396
00:21:56,716 --> 00:21:59,652
but I believe whoever
is calling me is good.

397
00:21:59,786 --> 00:22:02,056
How can you say that?
Look at our kingdom.

398
00:22:02,189 --> 00:22:06,494
I know. It's just that
my magic can feel it.

399
00:22:06,626 --> 00:22:08,195
I can feel it.

400
00:22:09,196 --> 00:22:10,498
Okay.

401
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:13,601
Oh, no. What now?

402
00:22:13,733 --> 00:22:15,369
The Trolls?

403
00:22:15,503 --> 00:22:18,405
- Kristoff! We missed you!
- Oh!

404
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,207
Pabbie.

405
00:22:20,341 --> 00:22:23,244
Well, never a dull moment
with you two.

406
00:22:23,377 --> 00:22:26,280
I hope you're prepared
for what you have done, Elsa.

407
00:22:26,413 --> 00:22:30,151
Angry magical spirits are not
for the faint of heart.

408
00:22:30,284 --> 00:22:31,986
Why are they still angry?

409
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:34,421
What does all of this
have to do with Arendelle?

410
00:22:34,555 --> 00:22:36,357
Let me see
what I can see.

411
00:22:39,026 --> 00:22:42,830
The past is not
what it seems.

412
00:22:43,663 --> 00:22:46,367
A wrong demands to be righted.

413
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,403
Arendelle is not safe.

414
00:22:49,537 --> 00:22:52,973
The truth must be found.

415
00:22:53,107 --> 00:22:54,208
Without it...

416
00:22:55,543 --> 00:22:57,710
I see no future.

417
00:22:58,345 --> 00:22:59,679
No future?

418
00:22:59,813 --> 00:23:01,949
When one can see
no future...

419
00:23:02,082 --> 00:23:06,120
all one can do
is the next right thing.

420
00:23:06,253 --> 00:23:08,088
The next right thing

421
00:23:08,222 --> 00:23:10,024
is for me to go
to the Enchanted Forest...

422
00:23:10,157 --> 00:23:11,659
and find that voice.

423
00:23:11,791 --> 00:23:12,860
Kristoff, can I borrow
your wagon

424
00:23:12,993 --> 00:23:14,028
- and Sven?
- Hmm?

425
00:23:14,161 --> 00:23:15,629
I'm not very comfortable
with the idea of that.

426
00:23:15,762 --> 00:23:17,865
- You are not going alone.
- Anna, no.

427
00:23:17,998 --> 00:23:20,568
I have my powers
to protect me. You don't.

428
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,269
Excuse me, I climbed
the North Mountain...

429
00:23:22,403 --> 00:23:23,437
survived a frozen heart,

430
00:23:23,571 --> 00:23:24,505
and saved you
from my ex-boyfriend...

431
00:23:24,638 --> 00:23:25,839
and I did it
all without powers,

432
00:23:25,973 --> 00:23:27,441
so, you know, I'm coming.

433
00:23:27,575 --> 00:23:28,775
Me, too. I'll drive.

434
00:23:28,909 --> 00:23:30,477
I'll bring the snacks!

435
00:23:30,611 --> 00:23:32,546
I will look
after your people.

436
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,647
Please make sure they stay

437
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,282
out of the kingdom
until we return.

438
00:23:35,416 --> 00:23:36,783
Of course.

439
00:23:36,917 --> 00:23:38,419
Let's let them know.

440
00:23:38,552 --> 00:23:41,355
Anna, I am worried
for her.

441
00:23:41,488 --> 00:23:42,755
We have always feared

442
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:45,526
Elsa's powers were too much
for this world.

443
00:23:45,659 --> 00:23:49,196
Now, we must pray
they are enough.

444
00:23:50,898 --> 00:23:53,067
I won't let anything
happen to her.

445
00:23:53,534 --> 00:23:55,069
Hyah!

446
00:23:58,505 --> 00:24:00,274
Who's into trivia?

447
00:24:00,407 --> 00:24:01,842
I am. Okay.

448
00:24:01,976 --> 00:24:04,511
Did you know that water
has memory? True fact.

449
00:24:04,645 --> 00:24:06,714
It's disputed by many,
but it's true.

450
00:24:06,847 --> 00:24:08,015
Did you know
men are six times

451
00:24:08,148 --> 00:24:09,717
more likely to be
struck by lightning?

452
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:11,919
Did you know gorillas
burp when they're happy?

453
00:24:12,052 --> 00:24:14,521
Did you know we blink
four million times a day?

454
00:24:14,655 --> 00:24:16,490
Did you know
wombats poop squares?

455
00:24:16,624 --> 00:24:17,790
Did you know
sleeping quietly

456
00:24:17,925 --> 00:24:19,627
on long journeys
prevents insanity?

457
00:24:21,128 --> 00:24:22,496
- Yeah, that's not true.
- It is.

458
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:23,697
- It's true.
- Definitely true.

459
00:24:23,831 --> 00:24:25,132
No, it's the truth.

460
00:24:25,266 --> 00:24:26,766
Well,
that was unanimous.

461
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,836
But I will look it up
when we get home.

462
00:24:31,372 --> 00:24:33,040
They're both asleep.

463
00:24:33,173 --> 00:24:36,243
So, what do you
wanna do?

464
00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:41,282
Sven, keep us steady,
will ya?

465
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:44,818
- Hmm...
- Anna. Ahem.

466
00:24:44,952 --> 00:24:45,953
- Anna?
- Mm-hmm?

467
00:24:46,086 --> 00:24:47,821
Remember
our first trip like this...

468
00:24:47,955 --> 00:24:49,957
when I said
you'd have to be crazy

469
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:51,759
to want to marry
a man you just met?

470
00:24:51,892 --> 00:24:53,394
Wait, what? Crazy?

471
00:24:53,527 --> 00:24:56,163
You didn't say I was crazy.
You think I'm crazy?

472
00:24:56,297 --> 00:24:57,731
No. I did.

473
00:24:57,865 --> 00:24:59,566
- You were...
- Huh?

474
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,768
...not crazy.

475
00:25:00,901 --> 00:25:02,202
Clearly.

476
00:25:02,336 --> 00:25:03,837
Just naive.

477
00:25:03,971 --> 00:25:07,341
Not naive. Just, uh,
new to love. Like I was.

478
00:25:07,474 --> 00:25:11,945
And when you're new,
you're bound to get it wrong.

479
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:13,981
So you're saying
I'm wrong for you.

480
00:25:14,114 --> 00:25:16,050
What? No, no.
I'm not saying

481
00:25:16,183 --> 00:25:18,652
you're wrong, or crazy.

482
00:25:18,786 --> 00:25:20,888
- Kristoff, stop. Please.
- Good idea.

483
00:25:21,021 --> 00:25:22,589
I hear it.
I hear the voice.

484
00:25:22,723 --> 00:25:24,558
You do?

485
00:25:24,692 --> 00:25:27,728
Olaf, wake up.

486
00:25:30,497 --> 00:25:32,599
- Whoa.
- Wow.

487
00:25:56,757 --> 00:25:58,659
Whoa! What the...

488
00:26:17,611 --> 00:26:19,146
Whoa.

489
00:26:26,086 --> 00:26:28,823
Promise me,
we do this together, okay?

490
00:26:28,956 --> 00:26:30,457
I promise.

491
00:26:39,666 --> 00:26:41,101
It's okay.

492
00:26:41,235 --> 00:26:43,470
Did you know
that an enchanted forest

493
00:26:43,604 --> 00:26:45,072
is a place
of transformation?

494
00:26:45,205 --> 00:26:47,007
I have no idea
what that means...

495
00:26:47,141 --> 00:26:48,877
but I can't wait to see

496
00:26:49,009 --> 00:26:52,679
what it's gonna do
to each one of us.

497
00:26:53,914 --> 00:26:55,182
- Hey!
- What is this?

498
00:26:55,315 --> 00:26:56,683
- No pushing.
- Stop it.

499
00:26:56,818 --> 00:26:58,152
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- It's too fast.

500
00:26:58,719 --> 00:26:59,821
What was that?

501
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:03,490
No. No, no, no.

502
00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:07,027
And we're locked in.

503
00:27:07,161 --> 00:27:09,163
Probably should have seen
that one coming.

504
00:27:10,964 --> 00:27:13,500
This forest is beautiful.

505
00:27:14,301 --> 00:27:15,335
Ooh.

506
00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:42,796
The dam. It still stands.

507
00:27:42,931 --> 00:27:45,632
It was
in Grand Pabbie's visions.

508
00:27:45,766 --> 00:27:47,134
But why?

509
00:27:47,267 --> 00:27:49,970
I don't know, but it's still
in good shape. Thank goodness.

510
00:27:50,103 --> 00:27:51,071
What do you mean?

511
00:27:51,205 --> 00:27:52,272
Well, if that dam broke...

512
00:27:52,406 --> 00:27:54,308
it would send
a tidal wave so big

513
00:27:54,441 --> 00:27:56,878
it would wash away
everything on this fjord.

514
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:58,278
Everything?

515
00:27:58,412 --> 00:28:00,815
But Arendelle's
on this fjord.

516
00:28:00,949 --> 00:28:02,951
Nothing's gonna happen
to Arendelle, Anna.

517
00:28:03,083 --> 00:28:04,451
It's gonna be fine.

518
00:28:04,585 --> 00:28:06,320
Come here.

519
00:28:11,826 --> 00:28:14,394
You know,
under different circumstances,

520
00:28:14,528 --> 00:28:17,866
this would be a, uh,
pretty romantic place.

521
00:28:17,998 --> 00:28:18,933
Don't you think?

522
00:28:19,066 --> 00:28:20,000
Different circumstances?

523
00:28:20,133 --> 00:28:21,401
You mean,
like with someone else?

524
00:28:21,535 --> 00:28:23,036
What? No! No.

525
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:24,404
I'm saying...

526
00:28:24,538 --> 00:28:25,807
Just in case we don't
make it out of here...

527
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:27,007
Wait, what?

528
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,408
You don't think we're gonna
make it out of here?

529
00:28:28,542 --> 00:28:29,743
No. No!

530
00:28:29,878 --> 00:28:31,278
I mean, no,
we will make it out of here.

531
00:28:31,411 --> 00:28:32,779
Well, technically the odds
are kind of complicated,

532
00:28:32,914 --> 00:28:34,381
but my point is...

533
00:28:34,515 --> 00:28:35,616
In case we die...

534
00:28:35,749 --> 00:28:38,018
- You think we're gonna die?
- No! No, no, no.

535
00:28:38,151 --> 00:28:39,286
- Where's Elsa?
- We will die at some point.

536
00:28:39,419 --> 00:28:40,420
I swore that
I wouldn't leave her side.

537
00:28:40,554 --> 00:28:41,856
Not in any
recent time will we die.

538
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:43,357
- Elsa!
- But way far in the future,

539
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:44,658
we will die.

540
00:28:48,662 --> 00:28:50,764
Don't patronize me.

541
00:28:59,573 --> 00:29:00,741
Elsa!

542
00:29:00,875 --> 00:29:02,075
There you are.

543
00:29:02,209 --> 00:29:04,344
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

544
00:29:04,478 --> 00:29:06,146
Okay, good.

545
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,282
Where's Olaf?

546
00:29:08,515 --> 00:29:09,550
Um...

547
00:29:09,683 --> 00:29:10,751
Anna?

548
00:29:11,318 --> 00:29:12,553
Elsa?

549
00:29:12,686 --> 00:29:14,221
Sven?

550
00:29:14,655 --> 00:29:16,356
Samantha?

551
00:29:18,725 --> 00:29:21,628
I don't even know
a Samantha.

552
00:29:24,765 --> 00:29:25,833
Whoa!

553
00:29:28,502 --> 00:29:29,503
Mm.

554
00:29:32,472 --> 00:29:33,808
That's normal.

555
00:29:46,153 --> 00:29:48,322
What was that?

556
00:29:49,489 --> 00:29:50,490
Samantha?

557
00:29:55,462 --> 00:29:59,466

This is fine.

578
00:31:25,019 --> 00:31:26,854
- Whoa!
- Olaf!

579
00:31:31,725 --> 00:31:32,793
Hey, guys.

580
00:31:32,927 --> 00:31:34,695
Meet the Wind Spirit.

581
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:38,198
Coming through!

582
00:31:38,331 --> 00:31:39,566
Ooh, I think
I'm gonna be sick.

583
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:42,703
I'd hold your hair back,
but I can't find my arms.

584
00:31:50,812 --> 00:31:52,546
Hey! Stop!

585
00:32:04,624 --> 00:32:05,625
Elsa!

586
00:32:08,762 --> 00:32:10,497
Let her go!

587
00:32:14,501 --> 00:32:16,269
Anna,
be careful!

588
00:32:16,838 --> 00:32:18,505
That's my sister!

589
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:24,578
Prince Agnarr!

590
00:32:27,915 --> 00:32:29,117
For Arendelle.

591
00:32:32,019 --> 00:32:33,020
Look out!

592
00:32:34,488 --> 00:32:35,923
Father!

593
00:32:45,032 --> 00:32:47,235
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

594
00:32:48,435 --> 00:32:50,905
What are these?

595
00:32:51,038 --> 00:32:54,942
Oh, they look like
moments in time.

596
00:32:55,076 --> 00:32:56,811
What's that thing
you say, Olaf?

597
00:32:56,944 --> 00:32:58,278
The thing... Oh!

598
00:32:58,411 --> 00:33:00,280
My theory about
advancing technologies

599
00:33:00,413 --> 00:33:01,681
as both our savior
and our doom?

600
00:33:01,816 --> 00:33:04,152
No, not that one.
The one about...

601
00:33:04,284 --> 00:33:05,385
- The one about cucumbers?
- No.

602
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:06,453
The thing about water.

603
00:33:06,586 --> 00:33:09,090
Oh! Yeah.
Water has memory.

604
00:33:09,223 --> 00:33:10,657
The water that
makes up you and me

605
00:33:10,791 --> 00:33:12,894
has passed through
at least four humans...

606
00:33:13,027 --> 00:33:14,962
and/or animals before us.

607
00:33:15,897 --> 00:33:17,064
Hmm.

608
00:33:17,198 --> 00:33:19,666
And remembers everything.

609
00:33:20,767 --> 00:33:22,870
The wind's back.

610
00:33:23,004 --> 00:33:25,106
Delicious.

611
00:33:25,239 --> 00:33:28,042
I think
I'll name you Gale.

612
00:33:29,811 --> 00:33:32,079
Get out of there. Whoa!

613
00:33:32,213 --> 00:33:34,215
- Oh. Hi.
- Aren't you curious?

614
00:33:35,917 --> 00:33:38,085
You in a better mood now?

615
00:33:48,196 --> 00:33:51,565
Father.
That's Father.

616
00:33:53,301 --> 00:33:54,768
This girl.

617
00:33:54,902 --> 00:33:56,904
She's saving him.

618
00:33:57,038 --> 00:33:58,306
She's Northuldra.

619
00:34:00,875 --> 00:34:02,109
What is that?

620
00:34:02,243 --> 00:34:04,045
Olaf, get behind me.

621
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:07,882
What are you gonna
do with that?

622
00:34:08,015 --> 00:34:09,183
I have no idea.

623
00:34:23,064 --> 00:34:24,664
Lower your weapon.

624
00:34:24,798 --> 00:34:27,301
And you lower yours.

625
00:34:27,434 --> 00:34:29,436
Arendellian soldiers?

626
00:34:29,569 --> 00:34:31,371
Threatening my people,
Lieutenant?

627
00:34:31,504 --> 00:34:34,175
Invading my dance space,
Yelena?

628
00:34:34,308 --> 00:34:35,343
Why does that soldier
look so familiar?

629
00:34:35,475 --> 00:34:36,743
No, no, no.

630
00:34:36,878 --> 00:34:37,812
Lieutenant!

631
00:34:37,945 --> 00:34:38,880
Get the sword!

632
00:34:46,854 --> 00:34:48,289
That was magic.

633
00:34:48,455 --> 00:34:49,824
Did you see that?

634
00:34:49,957 --> 00:34:51,993
Of course I saw it.

635
00:34:52,126 --> 00:34:53,627
You chose a nice,
cold greeting.

636
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,462
They've been trapped in
here this whole time?

637
00:34:55,595 --> 00:34:57,131
- Yeah.
- What do we do now?

638
00:34:57,265 --> 00:34:58,465
I got this.

639
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,201
Hi, I'm Olaf.

640
00:35:01,969 --> 00:35:05,006
Oh, sorry. Yeah, I just
find clothes restricting.

641
00:35:05,139 --> 00:35:07,241
Bet you're wondering who
we are and why we're here.

642
00:35:07,375 --> 00:35:09,110
It's really quite simple.

643
00:35:09,243 --> 00:35:11,411
It began with two sisters.

644
00:35:11,544 --> 00:35:13,281
One born with magical powers.

645
00:35:13,413 --> 00:35:14,681
One born powerless.

646
00:35:14,815 --> 00:35:16,616
Their love of snowmen,
infinite.

647
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:18,286
Anna, no! Too high!

648
00:35:18,418 --> 00:35:19,519
Blast!

649
00:35:19,653 --> 00:35:21,255
Mama! Papa! Help!

650
00:35:21,389 --> 00:35:23,391
Slam!
Doors shutting everywhere.

651
00:35:23,523 --> 00:35:25,458
Sisters torn apart.

652
00:35:25,592 --> 00:35:27,560
Well, at least
they have their parents.

653
00:35:27,694 --> 00:35:29,429
Their parents are dead.

654
00:35:29,562 --> 00:35:31,365
Oh.
Oh, hi. I'm Anna.

655
00:35:31,498 --> 00:35:32,699
I'll marry a man I just met.

656
00:35:32,833 --> 00:35:34,168
Elsa's gonna blow!

657
00:35:34,302 --> 00:35:36,536
Snow! Snow! Aah, run!

658
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:38,772
Magic pulses
through my snowflakes.

659
00:35:38,906 --> 00:35:40,341
I live.

660
00:35:40,473 --> 00:35:43,110
Ice palace for one.
Ice palace for one.

661
00:35:43,244 --> 00:35:44,845
Get out, Anna.
Pew! Pew!

662
00:35:44,979 --> 00:35:46,981
- My heart.
- Oh, my goodness.

663
00:35:47,114 --> 00:35:48,816
Only an act
of true love can save you.

664
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:50,985
Here's
a true love's kiss.

665
00:35:51,651 --> 00:35:52,987
You're not worth it.

666
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,621
Guess what?
I'm the bad guy.

667
00:35:54,754 --> 00:35:56,057
What?

668
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:59,226
And Anna
freezes to death forever.

669
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,028
Oh, Anna.

670
00:36:01,628 --> 00:36:02,830
Then she unfreezes!

671
00:36:02,964 --> 00:36:04,531
Oh, and then Elsa woke up
the magical spirits...

672
00:36:04,664 --> 00:36:06,000
and we were forced
out of our kingdom.

673
00:36:06,133 --> 00:36:07,567
Now our only hope is to find
the truth about the past...

674
00:36:07,701 --> 00:36:09,036
but we don't have a clue
how to do that...

675
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:10,404
except Elsa's hearing voices,

676
00:36:10,537 --> 00:36:11,906
so we got that going for us.

677
00:36:12,039 --> 00:36:13,573
Any questions?

678
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:17,979
I think they got it.

679
00:36:19,479 --> 00:36:21,215
Are you really
Queen of Arendelle?

680
00:36:21,349 --> 00:36:22,383
I am.

681
00:36:22,515 --> 00:36:23,550
Why would nature reward

682
00:36:23,683 --> 00:36:25,518
a person of Arendelle
with magic?

683
00:36:25,652 --> 00:36:27,888
Perhaps to make up for the
actions of your people.

684
00:36:28,022 --> 00:36:29,589
My people are innocent.

685
00:36:29,723 --> 00:36:31,624
We would have never
attacked first.

686
00:36:31,758 --> 00:36:33,194
May the truth be found.

687
00:36:33,327 --> 00:36:35,363
- Mm...
- Hi. I'm sorry.

688
00:36:35,495 --> 00:36:37,198
- Uh, what's happening?
- Hmm.

689
00:36:37,331 --> 00:36:39,367
That's it.
Lieutenant Mattias!

690
00:36:39,499 --> 00:36:41,202
Library, second portrait
on the left.

691
00:36:41,335 --> 00:36:43,703
You were our father's
official guard.

692
00:36:44,105 --> 00:36:45,739
Agnarr.

693
00:36:45,873 --> 00:36:47,640
What did happen
to your parents?

694
00:36:47,774 --> 00:36:50,911
Our parents' ship went
down in the Southern Sea...

695
00:36:51,045 --> 00:36:52,146
six years ago.

696
00:36:56,851 --> 00:36:59,954
I see him.
I see him in your faces.

697
00:37:00,087 --> 00:37:01,022
Really?

698
00:37:01,155 --> 00:37:02,490
Soldiers.

699
00:37:02,622 --> 00:37:05,493
We may be getting on in years,
but we're still strong.

700
00:37:05,625 --> 00:37:07,962
And proud to serve Arendelle.

701
00:37:09,163 --> 00:37:11,032
Wait. Please.

702
00:37:11,165 --> 00:37:13,100
Someone has called me here.

703
00:37:13,234 --> 00:37:15,236
If I can just find them...

704
00:37:15,369 --> 00:37:16,470
I believe
they have the answers

705
00:37:16,603 --> 00:37:19,407
that may help us
free this forest.

706
00:37:19,539 --> 00:37:21,641
Trust me,
I just want to help.

707
00:37:21,775 --> 00:37:24,145
We only trust nature.

708
00:37:24,278 --> 00:37:26,013
When nature speaks...

709
00:37:28,581 --> 00:37:29,649
...we listen.

710
00:37:29,783 --> 00:37:32,019
This will all
make sense when I'm older.

711
00:37:33,653 --> 00:37:34,955
Fire Spirit!

712
00:37:36,656 --> 00:37:38,059
Get back, everyone!

713
00:37:38,192 --> 00:37:40,061
Head for the river!

714
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:52,206
No! No! No! The reindeer!
That's a dead end!

715
00:37:52,339 --> 00:37:53,340
Come on, Sven!

716
00:37:54,008 --> 00:37:55,309
We'll get them.

717
00:37:58,212 --> 00:38:00,147
Elsa! Get out of there!

718
00:38:01,115 --> 00:38:02,116
No, no, no.

719
00:38:07,054 --> 00:38:08,222
Elsa!

720
00:38:19,732 --> 00:38:22,203
Come on, buddy,
we can do this. Hyah!

721
00:38:27,074 --> 00:38:28,042
Anna!

722
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,348
Oh!

723
00:38:34,482 --> 00:38:35,516
Get her out of here.

724
00:38:35,648 --> 00:38:38,018
No! Elsa!

725
00:39:51,992 --> 00:39:54,195
They're all looking at us,
aren't they?

726
00:39:56,163 --> 00:39:57,431
Got any advice?

727
00:39:59,333 --> 00:40:01,368
Nothing?

728
00:40:01,502 --> 00:40:03,703
Hmm. Should I know
what that means?

729
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,676
You hear it, too.

730
00:40:08,809 --> 00:40:10,743
Somebody's calling us.

731
00:40:10,878 --> 00:40:13,547
Who is it?
What do we do?

732
00:40:21,754 --> 00:40:24,124
Okay, keep going north.

733
00:40:26,961 --> 00:40:27,794
Elsa!

734
00:40:27,928 --> 00:40:29,029
- Oh, thank goodness!
- Anna.

735
00:40:29,163 --> 00:40:31,165
- Are you okay?
- What were you doing?

736
00:40:31,298 --> 00:40:32,266
You could've been killed.

737
00:40:32,399 --> 00:40:34,435
You can't just follow me
into fire.

738
00:40:34,568 --> 00:40:36,637
You don't want me
to follow you into fire,

739
00:40:36,769 --> 00:40:39,640
then don't run into fire.

740
00:40:39,772 --> 00:40:42,810
You're not
being careful, Elsa.

741
00:40:44,645 --> 00:40:47,514
I'm sorry.
Are you okay?

742
00:40:47,648 --> 00:40:49,516
I've been better.

743
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:52,820
Hmm. I know
what you need.

744
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:57,858
Where did you
get that scarf?

745
00:40:58,626 --> 00:41:00,461
That's a Northuldra scarf.

746
00:41:00,594 --> 00:41:01,629
What?

747
00:41:01,761 --> 00:41:04,565
This is from one of
our oldest families.

748
00:41:04,698 --> 00:41:06,333
It was our mother's.

749
00:41:15,309 --> 00:41:16,610
Elsa.

750
00:41:16,744 --> 00:41:18,012
I see it.

751
00:41:18,145 --> 00:41:20,147
It's Mother.

752
00:41:20,281 --> 00:41:23,550
Mother saved
Father's life that day.

753
00:41:27,554 --> 00:41:29,823
Our mother was Northuldra.

754
00:42:30,851 --> 00:42:32,986
We are called Northuldra.

755
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:36,290
We are the people of the sun.

756
00:42:38,392 --> 00:42:41,830
I promise you I will
free this forest...

757
00:42:41,962 --> 00:42:43,464
and restore Arendelle.

758
00:42:44,732 --> 00:42:46,667
That's a pretty
big promise, Elsa.

759
00:42:48,302 --> 00:42:51,238
Free the Forest?
Wow.

760
00:42:51,672 --> 00:42:52,673
I'm sorry.

761
00:42:52,807 --> 00:42:54,441
It's just, uh, some of us
were born in here,

762
00:42:54,575 --> 00:42:56,577
we've never even seen
a clear sky.

763
00:42:56,710 --> 00:42:57,778
I get it.

764
00:42:57,911 --> 00:42:59,747
- The name's Ryder.
- Kristoff.

765
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,315
I heard the voice again.

766
00:43:01,448 --> 00:43:02,783
We need to go north.

767
00:43:02,916 --> 00:43:05,219
But the Earth Giants now
roam the north at night.

768
00:43:05,352 --> 00:43:07,421
You can leave
in the morning.

769
00:43:07,554 --> 00:43:08,589
I'm Honeymaren.

770
00:43:08,722 --> 00:43:11,125
Honeymaren,
we'll do all we can.

771
00:43:14,628 --> 00:43:15,864
Hey, let me ask you.

772
00:43:15,996 --> 00:43:17,030
How do you guys cope...

773
00:43:17,164 --> 00:43:19,166
with the ever-increasing
complexity of thought

774
00:43:19,299 --> 00:43:21,602
that comes with maturity?

775
00:43:22,469 --> 00:43:23,937
Brilliant!

776
00:43:24,071 --> 00:43:25,272
Oh!

777
00:43:25,406 --> 00:43:27,441
It's so refreshing to talk
to the youth of today.

778
00:43:27,574 --> 00:43:28,843
Our future's
in bright hands.

779
00:43:28,976 --> 00:43:30,177
Oh, no, no.
Don't chew that.

780
00:43:30,310 --> 00:43:32,079
You don't know
what I've stepped in.

781
00:43:32,212 --> 00:43:33,914
I can't seem
to get her attention.

782
00:43:34,047 --> 00:43:35,549
Or even say
the right thing.

783
00:43:35,682 --> 00:43:37,017
Well, you're in luck.

784
00:43:37,151 --> 00:43:39,119
I know nothing
about women.

785
00:43:39,253 --> 00:43:40,220
But I do know
that we have

786
00:43:40,354 --> 00:43:43,223
the most amazing way
of proposing.

787
00:43:43,357 --> 00:43:44,291
If we start now,

788
00:43:44,425 --> 00:43:45,559
- we'll be ready by dawn.
- Really?

789
00:43:45,692 --> 00:43:46,760
Best part,

790
00:43:46,895 --> 00:43:48,295
it involves
a lot of reindeer.

791
00:43:48,429 --> 00:43:50,431
Whoa.

792
00:43:50,564 --> 00:43:51,632
Hey,
back at home...

793
00:43:51,765 --> 00:43:53,534
Halima still over
at Hudson's Hearth?

794
00:43:53,667 --> 00:43:54,601
She is.

795
00:43:54,735 --> 00:43:56,370
Really?
She married?

796
00:43:56,503 --> 00:43:57,504
Mm-mm.

797
00:43:57,638 --> 00:44:00,674
Oh, wow. Why didn't that
make me feel better?

798
00:44:00,809 --> 00:44:02,509
What else do you miss?

799
00:44:03,343 --> 00:44:04,778
My father.

800
00:44:04,913 --> 00:44:06,947
He passed
long before all this.

801
00:44:08,081 --> 00:44:10,617
He was a great man.

802
00:44:10,751 --> 00:44:12,152
Built us a good life
in Arendelle.

803
00:44:12,286 --> 00:44:15,122
But taught me to never take
the good for granted.

804
00:44:15,255 --> 00:44:17,491
He'd say, "Be prepared.

805
00:44:17,624 --> 00:44:19,092
"Just when you think
you've found your way,

806
00:44:19,226 --> 00:44:22,429
"life will throw you
onto a new path."

807
00:44:22,563 --> 00:44:24,531
What do you do
when it does?

808
00:44:24,665 --> 00:44:25,966
Don't give up.

809
00:44:26,099 --> 00:44:29,536
Take it one step
at a time and...

810
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:32,339
Just do
the next right thing?

811
00:44:32,473 --> 00:44:33,808
Yeah.

812
00:44:33,942 --> 00:44:35,175
You got it.

813
00:44:38,278 --> 00:44:41,415
I wanna show you
something. May I?

814
00:44:44,184 --> 00:44:46,687
You know air, fire,
water, and earth.

815
00:44:46,821 --> 00:44:48,021
Yes.

816
00:44:48,155 --> 00:44:49,590
But, look,
there's a fifth spirit...

817
00:44:49,723 --> 00:44:53,293
said to be a bridge between
us and the magic of nature.

818
00:44:53,427 --> 00:44:54,595
A fifth spirit?

819
00:44:54,728 --> 00:44:55,864
Some say

820
00:44:55,996 --> 00:44:58,632
they heard it call out
the day the Forest fell.

821
00:44:58,765 --> 00:45:00,300
My father heard it.

822
00:45:00,434 --> 00:45:02,736
Do you think
that is who's calling me?

823
00:45:02,871 --> 00:45:07,307
Maybe. Alas,
only Ahtohallan knows.

824
00:45:07,441 --> 00:45:09,142
Ahtohallan.

825
00:45:10,611 --> 00:45:14,949
<i>♪ Dive down deep

827
00:45:19,553 --> 00:45:21,321
Why do lullabies
always have to have

828
00:45:21,455 --> 00:45:22,991
some terrible
warning in them?

829
00:45:23,156 --> 00:45:24,959
I wonder
that all the time.

830
00:45:27,628 --> 00:45:29,296
Earth Giants.

831
00:45:29,429 --> 00:45:31,331
What are they
doing down here?

832
00:45:32,266 --> 00:45:33,767
Shh!

833
00:45:34,301 --> 00:45:35,335
Hide.

834
00:45:44,745 --> 00:45:46,413
They're coming!

835
00:45:54,856 --> 00:45:57,357
This is why
we don't play with fire.

836
00:45:58,492 --> 00:46:01,829
Oh, I can't stay mad at you.
Why are you so cute?

837
00:46:27,621 --> 00:46:31,158
Please tell me you were not
about to follow them.

838
00:46:31,291 --> 00:46:33,393
What if I can settle them
like I did the wind and fire?

839
00:46:33,527 --> 00:46:35,162
Or what if
they can crush you

840
00:46:35,295 --> 00:46:37,397
before you even
get the chance?

841
00:46:37,531 --> 00:46:41,069
Remember, the goal
is to find the voice...

842
00:46:41,201 --> 00:46:44,072
find the truth,
and get us home.

843
00:46:44,204 --> 00:46:46,306
Hey, guys.
That was close.

844
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:47,608
I know.

845
00:46:47,741 --> 00:46:50,110
The giants sensed me.
They may come back here.

846
00:46:50,243 --> 00:46:52,613
I don't want to put anyone
at risk again.

847
00:46:52,746 --> 00:46:53,948
And you're right, Anna.

848
00:46:54,082 --> 00:46:55,917
We've got
to find the voice.

849
00:46:56,050 --> 00:46:57,117
We're going now.

850
00:46:57,250 --> 00:46:58,652
Okay. We're going.

851
00:46:58,785 --> 00:47:00,054
Let me just...

852
00:47:02,289 --> 00:47:04,725
Wait. Where are
Kristoff and Sven?

853
00:47:04,859 --> 00:47:07,494
Oh, yeah. I think they
took off with that Ryder guy

854
00:47:07,628 --> 00:47:08,729
and a bunch of reindeer.

855
00:47:08,863 --> 00:47:10,031
- They left?
- Mm-hmm.

856
00:47:10,163 --> 00:47:12,666
Just left
without saying anything?

857
00:47:12,799 --> 00:47:14,836
Who knows
the ways of men?

858
00:47:22,043 --> 00:47:24,678
Am I supposed to feel
this ridiculous?

859
00:47:24,812 --> 00:47:26,246
Oh, yeah. Definitely.

860
00:47:26,948 --> 00:47:27,915
Everyone ready?

861
00:47:28,049 --> 00:47:29,050
Ready!

862
00:47:29,182 --> 00:47:30,250
Uh,
I could use a rehearsal.

863
00:47:30,384 --> 00:47:31,318
I love love.

864
00:47:31,451 --> 00:47:33,253
Wait. You talk
for them, too?

865
00:47:33,387 --> 00:47:34,688
I do.

866
00:47:34,822 --> 00:47:36,256
It's like you can actually
hear what they're thinking.

867
00:47:36,390 --> 00:47:38,725
Yeah. And then
you just say it.

868
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:40,293
And then you just say it.

869
00:47:43,031 --> 00:47:45,066
Okay. Here she comes.

870
00:47:46,466 --> 00:47:48,535
Princess Anna
of Arendelle...

871
00:47:48,669 --> 00:47:53,041
my feisty, fearless,
ginger-sweet love.

872
00:47:53,173 --> 00:47:55,709
Will you marry me?

873
00:47:56,811 --> 00:47:57,845
Um...

874
00:47:57,979 --> 00:47:59,147
No.

875
00:47:59,279 --> 00:48:01,181
The princess left
with the queen.

876
00:48:01,314 --> 00:48:03,183
What? Wait,
what? What?

877
00:48:03,316 --> 00:48:06,586
I wouldn't try to follow.
They're long gone.

878
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:07,989
Long gone?

879
00:48:08,122 --> 00:48:10,624
So, yeah.

880
00:48:11,692 --> 00:48:14,261
Um, we're heading west
to the Lichen Meadows.

881
00:48:14,394 --> 00:48:16,030
You can come with us
if you want.

882
00:48:20,935 --> 00:48:23,938
Hey. Um...
I'm really sorry that...

883
00:48:24,072 --> 00:48:26,540
- No, it's fine.
- Yeah. Yep.

884
00:48:26,673 --> 00:48:29,911
Okay, I better go pack.
You coming with?

885
00:48:30,044 --> 00:48:31,545
I'll just... Yeah,
I'll meet you there.

886
00:48:31,678 --> 00:48:33,747
Okay, uh, you know
where you're going, right?

887
00:48:33,881 --> 00:48:35,116
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yep.

888
00:48:35,248 --> 00:48:36,616

937
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:31,018
Hey, Olaf, um,
maybe just one of you should do it.

938
00:52:31,152 --> 00:52:33,087
I agree.
She's a little pitchy.

939
00:52:34,322 --> 00:52:36,090
Hey, Gale's back.

940
00:52:41,996 --> 00:52:43,030
What?

941
00:52:51,906 --> 00:52:53,773
How can it be?

942
00:52:53,908 --> 00:52:54,942
What is it?

943
00:52:55,910 --> 00:52:57,812
Mother
and Father's ship.

944
00:52:57,945 --> 00:53:00,780
But this isn't
the Southern Sea.

945
00:53:00,915 --> 00:53:03,084
No, it isn't.

946
00:53:15,830 --> 00:53:17,797
Why is their ship here?

947
00:53:18,899 --> 00:53:20,567
How is it here?

948
00:53:21,668 --> 00:53:24,372
It must have been washed in
from the Dark Sea.

949
00:53:24,504 --> 00:53:26,874
What were they doing
in the Dark Sea?

950
00:53:28,541 --> 00:53:30,411
I don't know.

951
00:53:30,543 --> 00:53:33,114
How did the ship
get through the mist?

952
00:53:33,247 --> 00:53:35,116
I thought nobody could but us.

953
00:53:35,715 --> 00:53:38,718
Unless nobody was on it.

954
00:53:39,719 --> 00:53:41,654
There's gotta be
something here.

955
00:53:41,788 --> 00:53:44,425
Wait. Wait.
Look around.

956
00:53:44,557 --> 00:53:47,128
Every Arendellian ship
has a compartment.

957
00:53:47,261 --> 00:53:48,628
Waterproof.

958
00:53:49,096 --> 00:53:50,831
That's very clever.

959
00:53:50,965 --> 00:53:52,199
Although,
it does make me wonder

960
00:53:52,333 --> 00:53:54,667
why they don't just make
the whole ship waterproof.

961
00:54:01,108 --> 00:54:02,243
Here.

962
00:54:08,215 --> 00:54:10,284
What language is this?

963
00:54:10,418 --> 00:54:11,651
I don't know.

964
00:54:11,785 --> 00:54:14,288
But look,
this is Mother's handwriting.

965
00:54:14,422 --> 00:54:15,789
"The end of the ice age.

966
00:54:15,923 --> 00:54:17,958
"The river found, but lost.

967
00:54:18,092 --> 00:54:21,962
"Magic's source.
Elsa's source?"

968
00:54:24,432 --> 00:54:26,067
It's a map.

969
00:54:28,069 --> 00:54:29,537
They traveled north

970
00:54:29,669 --> 00:54:33,441
and planned to cross
the Dark Sea to...

971
00:54:33,573 --> 00:54:35,443
Ahtohallan.

972
00:54:35,575 --> 00:54:37,144
It's real?

973
00:54:37,278 --> 00:54:38,379
Octa-who-what?

974
00:54:38,512 --> 00:54:39,914
Ahtohallan.

975
00:54:40,047 --> 00:54:41,648
It's a magical river

976
00:54:41,781 --> 00:54:44,151
said to hold all the
answers about the past.

977
00:54:44,285 --> 00:54:48,122
Reinforcing my "water
has memory" theory. Mm.

978
00:54:48,255 --> 00:54:49,957
Water has memory.

979
00:54:56,497 --> 00:54:58,466
Elsa?

980
00:54:58,598 --> 00:55:01,168
I wanna know
what happened to them.

981
00:55:08,909 --> 00:55:10,845
<i>Ahtohallan has to be
the source of her magic.</i>

982
00:55:10,978 --> 00:55:12,712
<i>We keep going
for Elsa.</i>

983
00:55:12,847 --> 00:55:13,981
<i>The waves are too high!</i>

984
00:55:14,115 --> 00:55:16,317
- <i>Iduna!</i>
- <i>Agnarr!</i>

985
00:55:19,719 --> 00:55:21,288
Elsa!

986
00:55:29,497 --> 00:55:31,432
Hey, hey, hey,
what are you doing?

987
00:55:31,565 --> 00:55:33,134
This is my fault.

988
00:55:33,267 --> 00:55:35,735
They were looking
for answers about me.

989
00:55:35,870 --> 00:55:39,073
You are not responsible
for their choices, Elsa.

990
00:55:39,206 --> 00:55:41,208
No. Just their deaths.

991
00:55:41,509 --> 00:55:43,077
Stop. No.

992
00:55:43,210 --> 00:55:45,813
Yelena asked,
why would the spirits

993
00:55:45,946 --> 00:55:48,516
reward Arendelle
with a magical queen?

994
00:55:48,648 --> 00:55:51,986
Because our mother
saved our father.

995
00:55:52,119 --> 00:55:54,021
She saved her enemy.

996
00:55:54,155 --> 00:55:58,325
Her good deed
was rewarded with you.

997
00:55:58,459 --> 00:56:00,027
You are a gift.

998
00:56:00,161 --> 00:56:01,295
For what?

999
00:56:01,428 --> 00:56:03,597
If anyone can resolve
the past...

1000
00:56:03,730 --> 00:56:06,934
if anyone can save Arendelle
and free this forest,

1001
00:56:07,067 --> 00:56:08,469
it's you.

1002
00:56:08,602 --> 00:56:12,907
I believe in you, Elsa.
More than anyone or anything.

1003
00:56:19,679 --> 00:56:22,149
Honeymaren said
there was a fifth spirit.

1004
00:56:22,283 --> 00:56:25,486
A bridge between
the magic of nature and us.

1005
00:56:25,619 --> 00:56:26,887
A fifth spirit?

1006
00:56:27,021 --> 00:56:29,957
That's who's been calling
me from Ahtohallan.

1007
00:56:30,090 --> 00:56:33,194
The answers about the
past are all there.

1008
00:56:33,928 --> 00:56:35,296
So we go to Ahtohallan.

1009
00:56:36,564 --> 00:56:37,965
Not "we."

1010
00:56:38,632 --> 00:56:40,000
- Me.
- What?

1011
00:56:40,134 --> 00:56:42,469
The Dark Sea is too
dangerous for us both.

1012
00:56:42,603 --> 00:56:45,339
No. No!
We do this together.

1013
00:56:45,472 --> 00:56:46,706
Remember the song?

1014
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:48,909
"Go too far and
you'll be drowned."

1015
00:56:49,043 --> 00:56:51,278
Who will stop you
from going too far?

1016
00:56:51,412 --> 00:56:52,513
You said you believed in me,

1017
00:56:52,646 --> 00:56:54,048
that this is
what I was born to do.

1018
00:56:54,181 --> 00:56:57,318
And I don't wanna
stop you from that.

1019
00:56:57,451 --> 00:56:59,420
I... I don't
wanna stop you

1020
00:56:59,553 --> 00:57:01,288
from being whatever
you need to be.

1021
00:57:01,422 --> 00:57:03,891
I just don't want
you dying...

1022
00:57:04,024 --> 00:57:08,162
trying to be everything
for everyone else, too.

1023
00:57:08,295 --> 00:57:09,430
Don't do this alone.

1024
00:57:09,563 --> 00:57:12,333
Let me help you, please.

1025
00:57:12,466 --> 00:57:14,268
I can't lose you, Elsa.

1026
00:57:17,204 --> 00:57:19,940
I can't lose you
either, Anna.

1027
00:57:21,008 --> 00:57:23,177
- Come on.
- Mmm.

1028
00:57:24,678 --> 00:57:25,846
Wait, what?

1029
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:27,514
What are you doing?

1030
00:57:27,648 --> 00:57:28,916
Elsa!

1031
00:57:31,784 --> 00:57:33,320
No! No!

1032
00:57:33,454 --> 00:57:34,722
Olaf, help me stop.

1033
00:57:34,855 --> 00:57:36,390
Give me a hand.

1034
00:57:39,493 --> 00:57:41,328
- Hang on!
- Whoa!

1035
00:57:41,462 --> 00:57:42,997
Wait. Wait!
No! No! No!

1036
00:57:43,130 --> 00:57:44,797
Oh, come on!

1037
00:57:44,932 --> 00:57:46,967
Anna,
this might sound crazy...

1038
00:57:47,101 --> 00:57:49,503
but I'm sensing
some rising anger.

1039
00:57:49,637 --> 00:57:51,972
Well, I am angry, Olaf!

1040
00:57:52,106 --> 00:57:54,742
She promised me
we'd do this together!

1041
00:57:54,875 --> 00:57:56,277
Yeah. Uh-huh.

1042
00:57:56,410 --> 00:58:00,347
But what I mean is,
I'm sensing rising anger in me.

1043
00:58:00,481 --> 00:58:02,383
Wait, you're angry?

1044
00:58:02,516 --> 00:58:04,518
Um, I... I think so.

1045
00:58:04,652 --> 00:58:06,487
Elsa pushed me away,
too,

1046
00:58:06,620 --> 00:58:09,156
and didn't even
say goodbye.

1047
00:58:09,290 --> 00:58:12,660
And you have every right
to be very, very mad at her.

1048
00:58:12,792 --> 00:58:15,262
And you said some things
never change.

1049
00:58:15,396 --> 00:58:16,630
But since then,

1050
00:58:16,764 --> 00:58:19,933
everything's done nothing
but change.

1051
00:58:20,267 --> 00:58:21,802
I know.

1052
00:58:21,935 --> 00:58:25,339
But look, I'm still here
holding your hand.

1053
00:58:25,472 --> 00:58:28,542
Yeah,
that's a good point, Anna.

1054
00:58:28,676 --> 00:58:30,744
I feel better.
You're such a good listener.

1055
00:58:30,878 --> 00:58:33,514
- -Don't shush me.
That's rude.

1056
00:58:33,647 --> 00:58:35,716
No! No!

1057
00:58:45,326 --> 00:58:47,661
Oh. The Giants.

1058
00:58:47,795 --> 00:58:49,730
They're huge.

1059
00:59:05,879 --> 00:59:07,481
- Hang on, Olaf.
- Huh?

1060
00:59:12,786 --> 00:59:14,555
Try not
to scream.

1061
00:59:28,202 --> 00:59:29,203
Found it.

1062
00:59:30,771 --> 00:59:32,272
Thank you.

1063
00:59:32,406 --> 00:59:34,441
Where are we?

1064
00:59:34,575 --> 00:59:36,811
In a pit
with no way out.

1065
00:59:36,944 --> 00:59:40,481
But with a spooky,
pitch-black way in.

1066
00:59:46,587 --> 00:59:48,122
Come on,
it'll be fun.

1067
00:59:48,255 --> 00:59:49,957
Assuming we don't
get stuck here forever,

1068
00:59:50,090 --> 00:59:51,058
no one ever finds us...

1069
00:59:51,191 --> 00:59:53,260
and you starve
and I give up.

1070
00:59:53,394 --> 00:59:55,864
But, bright side,
Elsa's gotta be doing

1071
00:59:55,996 --> 00:59:58,599
a whole lot
better than we are.

1072
01:00:36,270 --> 01:00:37,304
Okay.

1073
01:00:47,748 --> 01:00:49,216
Oh.

1074
01:00:58,959 --> 01:01:00,160
Whoa!

1075
01:01:27,688 --> 01:01:28,989
No!

1076
01:01:46,006 --> 01:01:47,574
Whoa!

1077
01:02:11,632 --> 01:02:12,633
No!

1078
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:41,261
Of course.

1079
01:02:41,395 --> 01:02:45,566
Glaciers are
rivers of ice.

1080
01:02:47,001 --> 01:02:49,102
Ahtohallan is frozen.

1081
01:02:54,441 --> 01:02:55,944
I hear you.

1082
01:02:56,076 --> 01:02:57,611

But I'm great actually.

1149
01:07:31,518 --> 01:07:33,888
Prince Hans
of the Southern Isles.

1150
01:07:34,989 --> 01:07:35,990
I love you.

1151
01:07:36,123 --> 01:07:37,691
I need to tell you
about my past.

1152
01:07:37,825 --> 01:07:38,758
And where I'm from.

1153
01:07:38,893 --> 01:07:40,161
I'm listening.

1154
01:07:40,294 --> 01:07:42,196
Iduna!

1155
01:07:42,330 --> 01:07:43,898
What are you reading,
Your Majesty?

1156
01:07:44,031 --> 01:07:45,398
Oh, some new
Danish author.

1157
01:07:52,606 --> 01:07:55,276
King Runeard,
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

1158
01:07:55,408 --> 01:07:56,443
Grandfather?

1159
01:07:56,576 --> 01:07:58,612
We bring Arendelle's
full guard.

1160
01:07:58,745 --> 01:08:02,515
But they have given us no
reason not to trust them.

1161
01:08:02,649 --> 01:08:04,285
The Northuldra
follow magic.

1162
01:08:04,417 --> 01:08:06,220
Which means we can
never trust them.

1163
01:08:06,354 --> 01:08:07,721
Grandfather?

1164
01:08:07,855 --> 01:08:10,557
Magic makes people feel too powerful.
Too entitled.

1165
01:08:10,690 --> 01:08:14,996
It makes them think they
can defy the will of a king.

1166
01:08:15,129 --> 01:08:16,964
That is not
what magic does.

1167
01:08:17,098 --> 01:08:18,565
That's just your fear.

1168
01:08:18,698 --> 01:08:20,935
Fear is what
can't be trusted.

1169
01:08:27,942 --> 01:08:30,344
You see, the dam
will weaken their lands,

1170
01:08:30,477 --> 01:08:32,113
so they will
have to turn to me.

1171
01:08:34,015 --> 01:08:38,386
<i>♪ Dive down

1173
01:08:43,357 --> 01:08:45,458
They will come
in celebration.

1174
01:08:45,592 --> 01:08:49,096
And then, we will know
their size and strength.

1175
01:08:50,764 --> 01:08:54,068
As you have welcomed us,
we welcome you...

1176
01:08:54,201 --> 01:08:56,670
our neighbors, our friends.

1177
01:09:14,587 --> 01:09:17,258
King Runeard, the dam isn't
strengthening our waters.

1178
01:09:17,391 --> 01:09:18,993
It's hurting the Forest.

1179
01:09:19,126 --> 01:09:20,394
It's cutting off
the North...

1180
01:09:20,527 --> 01:09:22,229
Let... Let's not
discuss this here.

1181
01:09:22,363 --> 01:09:25,299
Let's meet on the fjord.
Have tea.

1182
01:09:25,433 --> 01:09:27,134
Find a solution.

1183
01:09:38,745 --> 01:09:39,546
No!

1184
01:09:45,987 --> 01:09:47,188
Anna!

1185
01:09:56,297 --> 01:10:00,868
Hmm. Which lucky tunnel
do we choose?

1186
01:10:01,002 --> 01:10:03,471
<i>You see, the dam

1187
01:10:03,603 --> 01:10:04,839
<i>so they will

1188
01:10:04,972 --> 01:10:06,474
<i>King Runeard, the dam,</i>

1189
01:10:06,606 --> 01:10:08,376
<i>it's hurting the Forest.</i>

1190
01:10:13,381 --> 01:10:15,016
Elsa's found it.

1191
01:10:15,149 --> 01:10:16,417
What is it?

1192
01:10:16,549 --> 01:10:18,551
The truth about the past.

1193
01:10:19,519 --> 01:10:21,554
That's my grandfather...

1194
01:10:21,688 --> 01:10:25,092
attacking
the Northuldra leader...

1195
01:10:25,226 --> 01:10:27,828
who wields no weapon.

1196
01:10:30,464 --> 01:10:33,000
The dam wasn't
a gift of peace.

1197
01:10:34,068 --> 01:10:35,602
It was a trick.

1198
01:10:35,735 --> 01:10:37,338
But that goes
against everything

1199
01:10:37,471 --> 01:10:38,906
Arendelle stands for.

1200
01:10:39,507 --> 01:10:41,008
It does, doesn't it?

1201
01:10:43,777 --> 01:10:46,080
I know how to free
the Forest.

1202
01:10:46,213 --> 01:10:50,484
I know what we have to do
to set things right.

1203
01:10:50,617 --> 01:10:52,820
Why do you say that
so sadly?

1204
01:10:53,586 --> 01:10:55,322
We have to break the dam.

1205
01:10:55,456 --> 01:10:57,858
But Arendelle
will be flooded.

1206
01:10:57,992 --> 01:11:00,760
That's why everyone
was forced out.

1207
01:11:00,895 --> 01:11:03,998
To protect them
from what has to be done.

1208
01:11:04,331 --> 01:11:06,167
Oh. Oh!

1209
01:11:09,303 --> 01:11:10,737
Are you okay?

1210
01:11:10,871 --> 01:11:13,240
I could really use
a bright side, Olaf.

1211
01:11:14,008 --> 01:11:15,943
Bright side? Um...

1212
01:11:16,077 --> 01:11:18,678
Turtles can breathe
through their butts.

1213
01:11:18,813 --> 01:11:22,149
- Huh?
- And I see a way out.

1214
01:11:23,650 --> 01:11:25,718
I knew I could
count on you.

1215
01:11:30,057 --> 01:11:33,494
Come on, Olaf, Elsa's probably
on her way back right now.

1216
01:11:33,626 --> 01:11:34,995
We can meet her and...

1217
01:11:37,164 --> 01:11:38,165
Olaf?

1218
01:11:39,100 --> 01:11:40,234
What's this?

1219
01:11:40,667 --> 01:11:42,103
Are you okay?

1220
01:11:42,236 --> 01:11:44,171
I'm flurrying?

1221
01:11:44,305 --> 01:11:45,306
Wait. No. That's...

1222
01:11:45,439 --> 01:11:47,141
That's not it.

1223
01:11:48,476 --> 01:11:52,079
I'm flurrying away.

1224
01:11:52,213 --> 01:11:55,416
The magic in me is fading.

1225
01:11:55,549 --> 01:11:56,749
What?

1226
01:11:58,718 --> 01:12:00,687
I don't think Elsa's okay.

1227
01:12:00,821 --> 01:12:03,190
I think...

1228
01:12:04,258 --> 01:12:06,393
she may have gone too far.

1229
01:12:07,595 --> 01:12:10,030
No. No.

1230
01:12:10,164 --> 01:12:11,232
Anna?

1231
01:12:11,664 --> 01:12:13,666
I'm sorry.

1232
01:12:13,801 --> 01:12:17,071
You're gonna have to do
this next part on your own.

1233
01:12:17,204 --> 01:12:18,572
- Okay?
- Wait.

1234
01:12:18,705 --> 01:12:20,307
Come here.

1235
01:12:20,441 --> 01:12:22,742
- I've got you.
- Oh.

1236
01:12:23,210 --> 01:12:24,711
That's good.

1237
01:12:26,413 --> 01:12:28,115
Hey, Anna?

1238
01:12:28,249 --> 01:12:31,285
I just thought of one thing
that's permanent.

1239

What's that?

1240
01:12:33,354 --> 01:12:34,989
Love.

Wake up!

1293
01:18:04,685 --> 01:18:06,119
That's it.

1294
01:18:06,253 --> 01:18:08,455
Come and get me!
Come on!

1295
01:18:14,194 --> 01:18:15,729
Over here!

1296
01:18:18,298 --> 01:18:20,734
That's right.
Keep coming.

1297
01:18:20,869 --> 01:18:22,402
Keep coming!

1298
01:18:28,977 --> 01:18:30,143
That'll work.

1299
01:18:30,611 --> 01:18:32,012
This way, guys!

1300
01:18:42,656 --> 01:18:44,424
What?

1301
01:18:44,558 --> 01:18:47,127
No, no, no, no.
She's leading them to the dam.

1302
01:18:57,471 --> 01:18:58,338
Kristoff!

1303
01:18:58,472 --> 01:18:59,974
I'm here.
What do you need?

1304
01:19:00,107 --> 01:19:01,508
- To get to the dam.
- You got it.

1305
01:19:01,642 --> 01:19:02,643
Thank you.

1306
01:19:18,792 --> 01:19:20,394
Come on. Come on.

1307
01:19:20,527 --> 01:19:22,496
- Help me up!
- We'll meet you around!

1308
01:19:26,935 --> 01:19:28,002
Lieutenant Mattias.

1309
01:19:28,135 --> 01:19:30,571
Your Highness,
what are you doing?

1310
01:19:30,704 --> 01:19:31,973
The dam must fall.

1311
01:19:32,105 --> 01:19:34,575
It's the only way to break
the mist and free the Forest.

1312
01:19:34,708 --> 01:19:37,344
But we've sworn to protect
Arendelle at all costs.

1313
01:19:37,477 --> 01:19:40,815
Arendelle has no future
until we make this right.

1314
01:19:40,949 --> 01:19:43,083
King Runeard
betrayed everyone.

1315
01:19:44,284 --> 01:19:45,519
How do you know that?

1316
01:19:45,652 --> 01:19:48,322
My sister gave her life
for the truth.

1317
01:19:50,858 --> 01:19:52,092
Please.

1318
01:19:52,225 --> 01:19:54,261
Before we lose
anyone else.

1319
01:20:16,550 --> 01:20:17,584
Look out!

1320
01:20:24,959 --> 01:20:26,928
Destroy the dam!
Come on!

1321
01:20:27,061 --> 01:20:28,595
Throw your boulders.

1322
01:20:33,835 --> 01:20:34,902
That's it.

1323
01:20:52,285 --> 01:20:54,122
- I've got her!
- Anna!

1324
01:20:54,688 --> 01:20:55,957
Hang on!

1325
01:23:15,328 --> 01:23:17,798
I'm sorry
I left you behind.

1326
01:23:17,932 --> 01:23:20,767
I was just so desperate
to protect her.

1327
01:23:20,902 --> 01:23:23,905
I know. I know.
It's okay.

1328
01:23:24,038 --> 01:23:25,705
My love is not fragile.

1329
01:23:27,507 --> 01:23:28,675
Wow.

1330
01:23:29,376 --> 01:23:31,611
Look at the sky.

1331
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:36,017
I just didn't realize
there was so much of it.

1332
01:23:36,150 --> 01:23:38,052
34 years...

1333
01:23:38,186 --> 01:23:39,619
Five months...

1334
01:23:39,753 --> 01:23:42,455
And 23 days.

1335
01:24:53,261 --> 01:24:54,996
Is it really you?

1336
01:24:55,129 --> 01:24:57,064
Anna.

1337
01:24:58,933 --> 01:25:00,868
I thought I'd lost you.

1338
01:25:01,002 --> 01:25:02,270
Lost me?

1339
01:25:02,402 --> 01:25:05,039
You saved me. Again.

1340
01:25:05,172 --> 01:25:06,173
I did?

1341
01:25:06,307 --> 01:25:09,143
And, Anna,
Arendelle did not fall.

1342
01:25:11,178 --> 01:25:12,445
It didn't?

1343
01:25:12,579 --> 01:25:14,714
The spirits all agreed.

1344
01:25:14,849 --> 01:25:17,852
Arendelle deserves
to stand with you.

1345
01:25:19,320 --> 01:25:20,321
Me?

1346
01:25:20,453 --> 01:25:23,391
You did what was right.
For everyone.

1347
01:25:23,523 --> 01:25:25,592
Did you find
the fifth spirit?

1348
01:25:27,560 --> 01:25:30,164
You are
the fifth spirit.

1349
01:25:30,831 --> 01:25:31,899
You're the bridge.

1350
01:25:32,033 --> 01:25:34,634
Well, actually,
a bridge has two sides.

1351
01:25:34,768 --> 01:25:37,939
And Mother had
two daughters.

1352
01:25:38,072 --> 01:25:40,141
We did this together.

1353
01:25:40,274 --> 01:25:42,977
And we'll continue
to do this together.

1354
01:25:43,911 --> 01:25:44,912
Together.

1355
01:25:45,046 --> 01:25:47,014
Elsa! You're okay!

1356
01:25:50,617 --> 01:25:52,219
You look different.

1357
01:25:52,353 --> 01:25:53,421
Did you cut your hair
or something?

1358
01:25:53,553 --> 01:25:56,390
- Or something.
- Oh.

1359
01:25:59,693 --> 01:26:03,197
Anna, I need to ask you
a question.

1360
01:26:03,331 --> 01:26:05,032
Okay.

1361
01:26:05,166 --> 01:26:07,467
Do you want to build
a snowman?

1362
01:26:07,935 --> 01:26:09,070
What?

1363
01:26:21,648 --> 01:26:25,186
Thank goodness
water has memory.

1364
01:26:37,198 --> 01:26:38,399
Anna.

1365
01:26:38,531 --> 01:26:40,767
Elsa!

1366
01:26:40,901 --> 01:26:43,337
Kristoff! And Sven!

1367
01:26:43,471 --> 01:26:46,273
You all came back.

1368
01:26:46,407 --> 01:26:49,576
Oh, I love happy endings.

1369
01:26:49,709 --> 01:26:51,012
I mean, I presume we're done.

1370
01:26:51,145 --> 01:26:53,680
Or is this "putting us
in mortal danger" situation

1371
01:26:53,814 --> 01:26:55,383
gonna be a regular thing?

1372
01:26:55,515 --> 01:26:57,284
No. We're done.

1373
01:26:57,418 --> 01:27:00,553
Actually,
there is one more thing.

1374
01:27:01,055 --> 01:27:02,456
Anna,

1375
01:27:02,589 --> 01:27:05,226
you are the most extraordinary
person I've ever known.

1376
01:27:06,427 --> 01:27:09,263
I love you with all I am.

1377
01:27:09,397 --> 01:27:10,865
Will you marry me?

1378
01:27:10,998 --> 01:27:12,433
Oh.

1379
01:27:12,565 --> 01:27:14,567
- Yes!
- Ah.

1380
01:27:23,444 --> 01:27:24,845
Aw.

1381
01:27:39,559 --> 01:27:40,961
Arendelle's okay.

1382
01:27:41,095 --> 01:27:42,562
What?

1383
01:27:43,297 --> 01:27:44,999
Ahtohallan is beautiful.

1384
01:27:45,132 --> 01:27:46,333
Oh!

1385
01:27:46,467 --> 01:27:47,835
Hello.

1386
01:27:48,668 --> 01:27:52,106
You know,
you belong up here.

1387
01:27:52,239 --> 01:27:55,608
I took an oath to always do
what's best for Arendelle.

1388
01:27:56,510 --> 01:27:59,980
Luckily,
I know just what that is.

1389
01:28:00,114 --> 01:28:02,782
While I still don't know what
"transformation" means...

1390
01:28:02,917 --> 01:28:07,254
I feel like this Forest
has really changed us all.

1391
01:28:11,992 --> 01:28:17,465
Presenting Her Majesty,
Queen Anna of Arendelle!

1392
01:28:23,571 --> 01:28:26,073
Oh! Hello.
Hi.

1393
01:28:26,207 --> 01:28:29,076
Sven, don't you look nice.

1394
01:28:30,344 --> 01:28:32,313
Oh, my goodness! Olaf!

1395
01:28:32,446 --> 01:28:34,315
Charmed, I'm sure.

1396
01:28:34,448 --> 01:28:36,283
Charming.

1397
01:28:36,417 --> 01:28:37,885
Your Majesty.

1398
01:28:39,253 --> 01:28:41,055
Kristoff.

1399
01:28:41,188 --> 01:28:43,858
Aw, did you boys
get all dressed up for me?

1400
01:28:43,991 --> 01:28:46,060
It was Sven's idea.

1401
01:28:46,193 --> 01:28:49,230
One hour. You get this
for one hour.

1402
01:28:49,363 --> 01:28:50,931
That's okay.

1403
01:28:51,065 --> 01:28:53,033
I prefer you
in leather anyway.

1404
01:28:56,437 --> 01:28:58,873
I'm shocked you can last
an hour. That was brutal.

1405
01:28:59,006 --> 01:29:02,376
The things we do for love.

1406
01:29:02,510 --> 01:29:04,178
What is this crazy magic
called again?

1407
01:29:04,311 --> 01:29:05,579
A photograph.

1408
01:29:05,712 --> 01:29:07,581
Photograph. Huh.

1409
01:29:07,714 --> 01:29:08,715
We look good.

1410
01:29:08,849 --> 01:29:10,783
Halima. General Mattias.

1411
01:29:10,918 --> 01:29:12,887
Uh, Your Majesty.
I'll be right back.

1412
01:29:13,020 --> 01:29:15,556
You can look at our photograph
while I'm gone.

1413
01:29:15,688 --> 01:29:17,625
I'm just kidding.

1414
01:29:17,757 --> 01:29:19,927
- How am I doing?
- Fantastic.

1415
01:29:28,235 --> 01:29:32,907
Our lands and people,
now connected by love.

1416
01:29:38,946 --> 01:29:41,681
Hi, Gale.
You like it?

1417
01:29:41,815 --> 01:29:45,186
Oh, do you mind?
I've got a message for my sister.

1418
01:30:04,471 --> 01:30:06,473
Thank you.

1419
01:30:08,242 --> 01:30:10,978
"Charades Friday night.
Don't be late.

1420
01:30:11,111 --> 01:30:13,614
"And don't worry,
Arendelle's doing just fine.

1421
01:30:13,746 --> 01:30:15,616
"Keep looking
after the Forest.

1422
01:30:15,748 --> 01:30:17,551
