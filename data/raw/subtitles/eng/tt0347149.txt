HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE

4
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:40,684
Miss Sophie

5
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:43,186
I've closed up the shop

6
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:45,814
You should come too, Sophie

7
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,942
I'll just finish this
Go have some fun

8
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:51,069
All right, then, I'm off

9
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:53,321
I'm going

10
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:56,450
Look, it's Howl's castle

11
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:57,993
What? Howl? Where, where?

12
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,120
Look how close it is

13
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:02,164
Oh, no

14
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:04,249
I wonder if Howl's in town

15
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:13,341
It took off

16
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:16,178
No, just hiding
from all the soldiers

17
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:18,847
Say, did you hear?
Remember Martha, from South Haven?

18
00:02:19,014 --> 00:02:21,391
They say Howl tore her heart out

19
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:22,350
How scary...

20
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:24,978
Don't worry, he's not going
to want yours

21
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:28,064
Hurry up

22
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:31,401
Really?

23
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,029
Oh, cut it out...

24
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:37,110
Hey there little mouse,
lost your way?

25
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:39,279
Oh, no... I'm fine

26
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:41,823
Then how about a cup of tea?

27
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:43,158
Care to join me?

28
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:44,868
No thank you, I'm busy

29
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:47,662
She sure is a cute little mouse

30
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:50,040
Say, how old are you?
You live around here?

31
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:51,916
Let me pass!

32
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:55,378
See, it's those whiskers of yours

33
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:57,714
She's even cuter when she's mad

34
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:01,801
Where've you been?

35
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:03,178
Who are you?

36
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,763
I'm with her

37
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:07,724
Why don't you two take
a little walk

38
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:13,480
What the...?
Hey, wha...

39
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:16,733
Don't hold it against them

40
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,027
They're harmless

41
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:22,363
Where to? I'll be your escort

42
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:24,991
No, really, I'm only going to Cesari s

43
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,660
Act normal
I'm being followed

44
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:28,995
Just walk

45
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:52,143
Sorry, I got you involved

46
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:57,065
This way

47
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:05,657
Hold on

48
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:14,165
Drop your legs, keep walking

49
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,881
That's right, don't be frightened

50
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:38,856
Very nice

51
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,623
I'll draw them off

52
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:57,500
Wait here until the coast is clear

53
00:06:58,126 --> 00:06:59,085
Yes

54
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,254
That's my girl

55
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:15,226
Any chocolate Letties?

56
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:16,853
Look this way, Lettie

57
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:17,854
Hey, make room

58
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:19,063
Let's go for a walk, Lettie

59
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:20,189
My sister?

60
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:23,609
Come back soon, Lettie

61
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:28,489
Sophie?

62
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:31,993
How did you land
on the veranda like that?

63
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,536
Have you become an angel?

64
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:36,706
It feels like I'm in a dream...

65
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:39,000
Lettie, why not use the office?

66
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:42,545
Thanks, but I should really
be working

67
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,342
What?
You sure he wasn't a wizard?

68
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,385
He was so kind...

69
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,388
He rescued me...

70
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:55,266
Don't tell me he's stolen your heart

71
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:59,979
If that was the wizard Howl,
he'd have eaten it right up

72
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:03,983
Don't worry,
Howl's only after beauties

73
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,818
There you go again

74
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:09,155
Listen to me,
we live in dangerous times

75
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,200
They say even the Witch of the Waste
is back on the prowl

76
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,286
Sophie?

77
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:17,997
Oh, you...

78
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,710
Lettie, the Madeleines are done

79
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:25,004
Okay, be right there

80
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:26,380
All right

81
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:29,801
I'm going home

82
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:32,136
lt's a relief to know
you're doing well

83
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:35,181
Hello, Lettie

84
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:36,474
Nice to see you

85
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:40,436
Listen, are you going to spend
your whole life in that shop?

86
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:45,483
It meant so much to Papa
Besides, I'm the eldest

87
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:49,695
That's not what I meant
Are you sure you want to be a hatter?

88
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,197
Well, I...

89
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:52,573
Bye, Lettie

90
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:54,033
Come by the shop next time

91
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:55,076
Sure

92
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,244
I'll be on my way

93
00:08:56,369 --> 00:09:00,164
Sophie, you've got to
look out for yourself

94
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,443
Sorry, the shop's closed

95
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:13,070
I thought I'd locked the door

96
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:20,077
What a cheap shop,
full of cheap little hats

97
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:24,206
And you're quite cheap-looking yourself

98
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:28,169
This is just a simple hat shop

99
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,427
I think you had better leave

100
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:40,973
You're very brave, taking on
the Witch of the Waste

101
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,059
The Witch of the Waste?

102
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:54,028
You won't be able to tell anyone
about that spell

103
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:56,530
My regards to Howl

104
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:45,037
Is this really me!

105
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:47,289
I've got to stay calm

106
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,558
I've got to calm down

107
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:08,561
It's no use panicking, Sophie

108
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:12,731
I'll be fine, I'll be fine

109
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:18,654
I've got to calm down

110
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:31,500
I'm back!

111
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:33,043
Welcome home, Ma'am!

112
00:12:33,168 --> 00:12:34,712
- Welcome home
- How do you like it?

113
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:36,672
It's all the rage in Kingsbury

114
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:37,965
Amazing

115
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:39,008
It suits you

116
00:12:39,174 --> 00:12:41,302
Don't you think it's wonderful?

117
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,386
Sophie!

118
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:47,182
Mrs. Hatter, Sophie hasn't come down
to work yet

119
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:49,184
I wonder what's the matter?

120
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:53,188
Sophie!

121
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:01,822
Don't come in

122
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:04,158
I've got an awful cold

123
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:06,035
I don't want you to catch it

124
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:08,787
You sound just awful...

125
00:13:08,912 --> 00:13:10,873
Like some 90 year-old woman

126
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:13,709
I'll stay in bed today

127
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:16,545
You sure? All right, then

128
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,841
Here we go...

129
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,812
You'll be fine, old lady

130
00:13:33,937 --> 00:13:38,067
You're still healthy, and these clothes
finally suit you

131
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:42,905
But I can't stay here

132
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:54,625
Ouch, ouch

133
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:57,836
lt's not easy being old

134
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:10,557
They're saying this war
is going to be terrible...

135
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:24,488
Like a hand, granny?

136
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:28,534
Such a gentleman,
but I'll manage

137
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:32,287
Sure, old lady,
but where are you off to?

138
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:34,957
Just a bit farther than where
you're going

139
00:14:39,711 --> 00:14:41,713
I don't recommend it, granny

140
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,425
Nothing but witches and wizards ahead

141
00:14:44,591 --> 00:14:46,426
Thank you

142
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:49,388
Going to the Folding Valley,
at this hour?

143
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:51,974
Says her youngest sister's there

144
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:09,032
I've hardly made any progress at all

145
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:14,204
Thank goodness I've still got my teeth

146
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,630
That'll make a good cane

147
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,716
Up we go

148
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:34,308
Might be a bit too thick

149
00:15:42,941 --> 00:15:44,484
Ouch, ouch

150
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:46,862
What a stubborn branch

151
00:15:49,364 --> 00:15:51,700
Never underestimate
Grandma Sophie

152
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,493
Heave

153
00:16:04,379 --> 00:16:08,550
A scarecrow, eh? I thought you were
working for the Witch

154
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:11,887
But how do you stand by yourself?

155
00:16:14,514 --> 00:16:16,516
Your head's a turnip

156
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:20,228
I've always hated turnips

157
00:16:20,395 --> 00:16:22,940
At least you're not
upside down anymore

158
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:24,775
So long

159
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:33,742
lt's so cold

160
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:36,536
The town's still so close

161
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:46,672
Don't follow me
You don't owe me a thing

162
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:49,049
You must be a magical whatever-you-are

163
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:52,010
I've had enough of witches and spells!

164
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:55,389
Just go stand wherever you like!

165
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:19,913
This is a perfect cane
Thank you kindly

166
00:17:20,038 --> 00:17:24,292
While you're at it, could you bring me
a house to sleep in?

167
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:38,140
Seems you get more cunning with age

168
00:17:49,067 --> 00:17:50,902
What a huge battleship

169
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:57,742
I never realized how weak you feel
when you get old

170
00:18:14,217 --> 00:18:18,471
I smell smoke
Maybe there's a cabin

171
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:40,827
Turnip-head, isn't that Howl s Castle?

172
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:44,998
This is hardly what I meant
when I asked for shelter!

173
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:57,427
What is this?

174
00:18:57,552 --> 00:18:59,054
You call this a castle?

175
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,326
Is that the way in?

176
00:19:23,244 --> 00:19:25,163
Just wait up there

177
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:29,000
Hey, there!

178
00:19:30,293 --> 00:19:33,046
Are you going to let me on, or not!

179
00:19:37,592 --> 00:19:39,386
My shawl!

180
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:56,152
It seems warm enough inside, Turnip
I'm going in

181
00:19:56,277 --> 00:19:57,404
Thank you

182
00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:01,491
Even Howl wouldn't want
an ancient heart like mine

183
00:20:04,285 --> 00:20:05,995
This time, it's really goodbye

184
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:08,998
You may be a turnip,
but you're a good turnip

185
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:11,126
May you find happiness

186
00:20:58,173 --> 00:21:02,635
What is this place?
Just looks like a dilapidated heap

187
00:21:11,269 --> 00:21:15,857
Well, one nice thing about getting old
is that nothing surprises you anymore

188
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:27,660
That's some spell you're under

189
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:31,664
It won't be easy to break

190
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:34,709
The fire talked

191
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:37,295
And you can't even
tell anyone about it

192
00:21:37,712 --> 00:21:39,297
You're Howl?

193
00:21:39,422 --> 00:21:43,968
Wrong. I'm the fire demon, Calcifer!

194
00:21:44,385 --> 00:21:48,723
Well, then, Calcifer, can you break
the spell I'm under?

195
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:50,391
Easy

196
00:21:50,558 --> 00:21:53,019
If you break the spell that chains me
to this place,

197
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:55,688
I'll break your spell in a flash

198
00:21:56,564 --> 00:21:59,234
In other words, bargain with a demon

199
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:01,819
You sure you can keep that promise?

200
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:04,489
Demons don't make promises

201
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:07,575
I suggest you look elsewhere

202
00:22:07,825 --> 00:22:09,953
But I'm an exploited demon

203
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:13,581
I'm chained here by a contract with Howl,
who works me to death

204
00:22:13,748 --> 00:22:16,751
I'm the one who keeps
this castle moving

205
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:20,421
My, you've got it rough

206
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:25,009
If you figure out the secret contract,
the spell will break

207
00:22:25,134 --> 00:22:27,971
If you do that,
I'll break your spell, too

208
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:32,517
All right
A bargain, eh?

209
00:22:37,897 --> 00:22:39,232
Granny

210
00:22:39,357 --> 00:22:40,692
Granny

211
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:47,407
Boy...
I've got my doubts about her

212
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:43,296
Hey, who's this?

213
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:45,006
Porthaven!

214
00:23:45,256 --> 00:23:47,383
When did she get in?

215
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:55,850
Stand by

216
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:01,814
Why, Mayor, sir

217
00:24:01,939 --> 00:24:05,902
The sun is already high
Is Master Jenkins at home?

218
00:24:06,277 --> 00:24:08,154
The Master is out

219
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:10,907
I answer in his stead

220
00:24:11,574 --> 00:24:14,327
An invitation from His Majesty

221
00:24:14,452 --> 00:24:15,745
It has come to war

222
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,623
His Majesty desires every wizard

223
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:21,667
and magician, even the witches,
to aid our homeland

224
00:24:21,792 --> 00:24:25,087
His presence is imperative
That is all

225
00:24:27,673 --> 00:24:29,383
War, how awful

226
00:24:30,259 --> 00:24:32,261
And who might you be?

227
00:24:32,887 --> 00:24:34,597
Calcifer let me in

228
00:24:34,722 --> 00:24:38,017
Don't look at me
She wandered in from the Wastes

229
00:24:38,392 --> 00:24:39,519
The Wastes?

230
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:42,897
That's strange
You're not a witch, are you?

231
00:24:43,689 --> 00:24:45,816
A witch could never get in

232
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,236
Porthaven, again

233
00:24:49,153 --> 00:24:50,530
A customer?

234
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:54,075
Stand by

235
00:24:56,911 --> 00:24:58,496
State your purpose

236
00:24:58,621 --> 00:25:00,289
Mama sent me

237
00:25:00,748 --> 00:25:03,417
The usual spell?

238
00:25:04,752 --> 00:25:06,879
Behave yourself, now

239
00:25:23,896 --> 00:25:25,273
It's not the Wastes

240
00:25:25,439 --> 00:25:28,276
Granny, are you a witch, too?

241
00:25:28,859 --> 00:25:33,072
That's right,
I'm the scariest witch in the land

242
00:25:33,197 --> 00:25:36,117
Sprinkle this powder on your ship
and the winds will favor it

243
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:37,410
Sure

244
00:25:39,745 --> 00:25:41,330
Many thanks

245
00:25:43,374 --> 00:25:45,626
I can't have you making up things

246
00:25:45,793 --> 00:25:47,628
You should give up that disguise

247
00:25:47,795 --> 00:25:50,673
lt's not a disguise, it's magic

248
00:25:52,466 --> 00:25:54,260
The Kingsbury door

249
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:56,929
Stand by

250
00:26:02,476 --> 00:26:05,187
Is this the residence of
Wizard Pendragon?

251
00:26:05,312 --> 00:26:06,439
It is, indeed

252
00:26:06,564 --> 00:26:09,734
I bear an invitation
from His Majesty

253
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:14,321
Please inform Master Pendragon
that he is required at the Palace

254
00:26:15,072 --> 00:26:17,199
Our thanks to you

255
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:34,467
A city fit for a king

256
00:26:34,592 --> 00:26:37,303
Get back in or you'll lose your nose

257
00:26:42,391 --> 00:26:44,685
Stop wandering around

258
00:27:20,721 --> 00:27:23,849
That's enough!
I'm going to get really mad

259
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:26,852
This is a magic house, isn't it?

260
00:27:27,019 --> 00:27:27,895
Oh, boy!

261
00:27:28,062 --> 00:27:30,105
Where does the black one lead?

262
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:31,607
Only Master Howl knows

263
00:27:32,358 --> 00:27:34,610
I'm having my breakfast

264
00:27:43,911 --> 00:27:46,247
But you've got bacon and eggs

265
00:27:47,206 --> 00:27:50,334
We can't use the fire
when Master Howl s away

266
00:27:53,879 --> 00:27:55,756
I'll cook for you

267
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:57,258
But you can't

268
00:27:57,383 --> 00:28:00,719
Calcifer only obeys Master Howl

269
00:28:00,928 --> 00:28:03,556
That's right, I won't cook for you

270
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:06,517
Oh, here's my hat

271
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:12,648
All right, Calcifer
Be a good fire, now

272
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:15,234
Forget it, I'm a demon

273
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:17,987
I answer to no one

274
00:28:18,445 --> 00:28:21,574
You'll do as I say,
or I'll pour water on you

275
00:28:21,699 --> 00:28:24,618
Or would you rather I told Howl
about our bargain?

276
00:28:25,953 --> 00:28:29,873
Hey! Hey!
I never should've let this old lady in

277
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:31,959
So, what'll it be?

278
00:28:35,337 --> 00:28:38,424
That's right, there's a good fire

279
00:28:40,718 --> 00:28:43,345
Hey! Hey!
I'll burn the bacon

280
00:28:43,762 --> 00:28:45,889
Calcifer's doing what she says

281
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:48,726
I'd like some tea, too
Have you got a kettle?

282
00:28:48,851 --> 00:28:50,019
Sure

283
00:28:59,278 --> 00:29:01,322
Welcome home, Master Howl

284
00:29:01,488 --> 00:29:03,574
You have letters from the king

285
00:29:03,699 --> 00:29:06,410
To Jenkins and to Pendragon

286
00:29:17,004 --> 00:29:20,007
Calcifer, you're so obedient

287
00:29:20,382 --> 00:29:22,009
She bullied me

288
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,304
Not an easy thing to do

289
00:29:25,846 --> 00:29:27,264
Who exactly are you?

290
00:29:27,681 --> 00:29:30,351
I'm Grandma Sophie

291
00:29:30,517 --> 00:29:33,270
You see, I'm your
new cleaning lady

292
00:29:33,771 --> 00:29:34,938
Give me that

293
00:29:38,942 --> 00:29:42,071
Pass me two more bacon slices
and six more eggs

294
00:30:02,508 --> 00:30:03,592
Yummy

295
00:30:04,384 --> 00:30:05,886
Yummy

296
00:30:12,935 --> 00:30:15,020
And who hired you to clean?

297
00:30:15,687 --> 00:30:17,356
Why, I hired myself

298
00:30:17,481 --> 00:30:19,900
I've never seen such a filthy house

299
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,652
Hmm

300
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:23,695
Markl, plates

301
00:30:27,324 --> 00:30:29,660
You're all ganging up on me

302
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:31,537
Please join us, Sophie

303
00:30:37,084 --> 00:30:38,669
Sit over here

304
00:30:53,517 --> 00:30:54,476
Pick one

305
00:30:54,977 --> 00:30:56,979
Everything else is dirty

306
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:01,984
I've got my work cut out for me

307
00:31:04,361 --> 00:31:05,279
Markl

308
00:31:05,404 --> 00:31:06,405
Yes

309
00:31:08,031 --> 00:31:09,074
Sophie

310
00:31:09,241 --> 00:31:10,617
Thank you

311
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:14,621
Brethren, let us partake
of our daily bread

312
00:31:14,788 --> 00:31:15,747
Our daily bread

313
00:31:15,914 --> 00:31:18,375
Haven't had a real breakfast
in a long while

314
00:31:25,173 --> 00:31:28,051
So many manners to teach...

315
00:31:29,136 --> 00:31:31,888
So, what's that in your pocket?

316
00:31:33,807 --> 00:31:35,183
What?

317
00:31:43,609 --> 00:31:44,651
I wonder what it is

318
00:31:44,818 --> 00:31:46,194
Let me

319
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:55,037
It's scorched into the table
Master Howl, this is...

320
00:31:55,996 --> 00:31:57,539
Ancient sorcery

321
00:31:57,664 --> 00:31:59,041
And powerful, too

322
00:31:59,458 --> 00:32:00,876
The Witch of the Waste?

323
00:32:01,918 --> 00:32:05,631
"He who catches a falling star,
oh heartless man"

324
00:32:05,797 --> 00:32:08,050
"Your heart shall be mine..."

325
00:32:08,175 --> 00:32:09,634
Well, so much for the table

326
00:32:23,565 --> 00:32:25,317
Wow, it's gone!

327
00:32:25,442 --> 00:32:27,903
The scorch mark has vanished,
but not the spell

328
00:32:28,487 --> 00:32:31,114
Brethren, continue your meal

329
00:32:32,366 --> 00:32:35,410
Calcifer, move the castle
100 kilometers

330
00:32:40,916 --> 00:32:42,918
And send hot water to the bath

331
00:32:43,043 --> 00:32:44,169
Not that, too!

332
00:32:46,546 --> 00:32:49,091
Do you work for the
Witch of the Waste?

333
00:32:50,384 --> 00:32:54,388
Don't be stupid! The witch...

334
00:32:57,808 --> 00:33:01,853
Actually...
the witch... I...

335
00:33:03,396 --> 00:33:04,940
Confound it!

336
00:33:05,857 --> 00:33:08,944
Damn that Witch of the Waste
Wait til I get my hands on her!

337
00:33:09,069 --> 00:33:11,113
Let me finish eating this

338
00:33:15,242 --> 00:33:18,787
Bugs, you'd better scurry away
or I'll sweep you out

339
00:33:21,206 --> 00:33:23,333
Every last one of you, mocking me

340
00:33:30,423 --> 00:33:32,259
There's a spell I need

341
00:33:32,425 --> 00:33:33,510
Later

342
00:33:33,635 --> 00:33:35,720
A witch rages within

343
00:33:42,394 --> 00:33:43,770
Sophie

344
00:33:45,772 --> 00:33:48,900
Sophie, I'm going out

345
00:33:49,776 --> 00:33:52,070
I'll die without some fresh wood

346
00:33:52,696 --> 00:33:54,531
What, what are you doing?

347
00:33:54,865 --> 00:33:58,201
I'll fall, I'll fall
I'm in peril

348
00:33:58,785 --> 00:34:00,412
I'm sweeping the ashes

349
00:34:00,579 --> 00:34:01,580
Won't be a minute

350
00:34:01,705 --> 00:34:03,623
Oh, no
Oh, no

351
00:34:03,748 --> 00:34:05,417
I'm in danger

352
00:34:06,793 --> 00:34:07,919
I'm in danger...

353
00:34:08,378 --> 00:34:09,546
I'll go out

354
00:34:12,632 --> 00:34:15,594
Oh, no
I'm slipping...

355
00:34:21,766 --> 00:34:23,852
Hurry, Sophie

356
00:34:46,082 --> 00:34:49,044
Try not to torment my friend

357
00:34:54,257 --> 00:34:56,593
Master Howl, are you going out?

358
00:34:59,012 --> 00:35:03,558
Markl, tell our cleaning lady
not to get too carried away

359
00:35:08,396 --> 00:35:10,231
What'd you do, Sophie?

360
00:35:11,191 --> 00:35:12,734
She abused me

361
00:35:13,234 --> 00:35:16,029
If I die, Howl goes with me

362
00:35:16,196 --> 00:35:17,656
I'm the cleaning lady

363
00:35:17,781 --> 00:35:19,991
It's my job to clean

364
00:35:21,451 --> 00:35:24,037
No, not the 2nd floor!

365
00:35:24,579 --> 00:35:27,540
If I were you, I'd put your
precious things away in a hurry

366
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:30,585
Save my room for later

367
00:35:33,713 --> 00:35:36,925
My little outburst gave me back
my strength

368
00:35:40,553 --> 00:35:42,806
What a strange house

369
00:36:19,426 --> 00:36:20,927
Amazing!

370
00:36:21,094 --> 00:36:23,304
Calcifer, Calcifer!

371
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:25,557
Are you moving the castle?

372
00:36:25,682 --> 00:36:28,184
What a lot of fuss! Of course I am

373
00:36:28,309 --> 00:36:29,811
You're incredible, Calcifer

374
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:33,356
Your magic's first class
I misjudged you completely

375
00:36:35,984 --> 00:36:37,527
You think so?

376
00:36:37,652 --> 00:36:39,696
You really think so!

377
00:36:46,077 --> 00:36:48,079
Oh, no, not yet!

378
00:37:20,528 --> 00:37:21,779
How beautiful

379
00:37:21,988 --> 00:37:24,115
It's called Star Lake

380
00:37:29,162 --> 00:37:31,039
Something s stuck in there

381
00:37:31,164 --> 00:37:33,541
Oh, dear
Lend me a hand, Markl

382
00:37:33,666 --> 00:37:34,792
Sure

383
00:37:40,924 --> 00:37:42,133
And up!

384
00:37:42,258 --> 00:37:43,760
A scarecrow

385
00:37:43,885 --> 00:37:45,845
He's called Turnip, the Turnip-head

386
00:37:46,054 --> 00:37:48,890
You sure like being upside down

387
00:37:57,899 --> 00:38:00,193
The odd creature seems to have
taken a liking to me

388
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,236
He followed me here

389
00:38:02,362 --> 00:38:04,614
Are you sure you're not a witch, Sophie?

390
00:38:04,739 --> 00:38:08,368
That's right, I'm the cleanest witch
in the land

391
00:38:37,647 --> 00:38:40,483
Turnip, don't pull it so tight

392
00:38:49,617 --> 00:38:52,161
Seems like he likes doing the wash

393
00:38:52,286 --> 00:38:54,580
They'll dry in no time

394
00:38:57,041 --> 00:38:59,377
Turnip must belong to the demons

395
00:38:59,502 --> 00:39:01,170
Calcifer doesn't seem to mind him

396
00:39:01,295 --> 00:39:04,257
You're right,
maybe he's a demon of the dead

397
00:39:05,466 --> 00:39:09,053
But he led me
to this wonderful place

398
00:39:51,429 --> 00:39:54,182
I've put away all the laundry, Sophie

399
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:57,810
Why, thank you
We'd better be getting back

400
00:39:58,060 --> 00:39:59,937
How mysterious

401
00:40:00,062 --> 00:40:03,482
I've never felt such peace
