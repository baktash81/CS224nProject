1
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:44,033
Help me.

2
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:20,749
As the sun rose over
the Island of Cheese, -

3
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:24,116
- casting long shadows
through the sausage bushes, -

4
00:03:24,279 --> 00:03:27,271
- illuminating the tops
of the honey trees -

5
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:31,034
- and warming the fields
of smoked salmon, -

6
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:36,068
- I Baron Munchausen,
who am world renowned -

7
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:41,233
- for telling the truth, the whole
truth and nothing but the truth...

8
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:50,231
- Tighter!
- Hold steady.

9
00:03:50,399 --> 00:03:56,713
How can you become a great
actress if you get blown to pieces?

10
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,315
...in my native land...

11
00:04:03,279 --> 00:04:06,077
...there to attempt the education -

12
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:12,428
- of my provincial, narrow-minded,
and incredulous countrymen.

13
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:16,308
We heaved anchor and set sail.

14
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:26,435
We heaved anchor and set sail!

15
00:04:28,359 --> 00:04:31,476
Waves! The waves!

16
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:33,834
Oh bugger!

17
00:04:33,999 --> 00:04:37,833
We are actors!
Where the devil are the stagehands?

18
00:04:37,999 --> 00:04:40,035
- Dead!
- All of them?

19
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:45,432
Suicide.
Nothing to do with your acting.

20
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:54,107
Ill luck pursued me. I was blown
towards the jaws of a whale -

21
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:57,794
- of such prodigious size
and length -

22
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:05,513
- that even with my telescope
I could not see the end of him.

23
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:10,596
What will become of the baron?

24
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:13,796
Surely this time there is no escape.

25
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:33,030
At a time like this, a modicum
of snuff can be most efficacious.

26
00:05:50,799 --> 00:05:54,155
Hell's bells and buckets of blood!

27
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:59,951
Where were the waves?
The waves!

28
00:06:00,119 --> 00:06:03,077
You incompetent imbecile!

29
00:06:03,239 --> 00:06:09,030
- It wasn't me. It was her!
- It wasn't me! It was him!

30
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:16,398
We are supposed to be professionals
and we're trying to stay alive.

31
00:06:16,559 --> 00:06:19,551
Sally!

32
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,194
Stay in here.

33
00:06:24,359 --> 00:06:28,238
- Where's my brother?
- You haven't got a brother.

34
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:33,837
Then you just tell me
why it says "Henry Salt & Son".

35
00:06:33,999 --> 00:06:39,551
I shouldn't have taught you to read.
It's traditional. That's how it is.

36
00:06:56,239 --> 00:07:00,278
No. The Sultan's demands
are still not sufficiently rational.

37
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:03,829
The only lasting peace
is one based on reason.

38
00:07:03,999 --> 00:07:06,559
I'm sorry, Mr. Jackson.

39
00:07:06,719 --> 00:07:11,509
The first act didn't go so well.
One or two technical problems.

40
00:07:11,679 --> 00:07:17,151
Don't apologise, Mr. Salt.
These are very trying circumstances.

41
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:23,077
Excuse me.

42
00:07:23,239 --> 00:07:27,027
The officer who risked his life
by destroying...

43
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:33,718
...six enemy cannon and rescuing
ten men held captive by the Turk.

44
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:37,713
- We've heard so much about you.
- I suppose so, sir.

45
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:43,112
- Always taking excessive risks.
- I only did my best, sir.

46
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:47,875
- Have him executed at once.
- Yes, sir.

47
00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:52,191
Such behaviour is demoralizing
for ordinary soldiers.

48
00:07:52,359 --> 00:07:56,034
They're trying to lead
simple, unexceptional lives.

49
00:07:56,199 --> 00:07:59,953
Things are difficult enough without
emotional people rocking the boat.

50
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:25,429
Constantinople!

51
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:30,673
The court of the Grand Turk.
What a surprise -

52
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:34,832
- that a passing zephyr
should waft me here.

53
00:08:34,999 --> 00:08:39,629
Perhaps I should teach
the Sultan a lesson or two.

54
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:46,870
His Highness the Sultan
loved a good wine -

55
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:53,672
- and could never resist a wager.
Characteristics that cost him dear.

56
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:59,072
Lies! Lies! You scoundrels.
I won't put up with this!

57
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:02,151
Stop this travesty!

58
00:09:02,319 --> 00:09:07,996
It's an insult. I've never seen
so much rubbish in all my life.

59
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:11,151
You don't know what you're saying.

60
00:09:11,319 --> 00:09:17,918
- After a sumptuous dinner...
- Is this supposed to happen?

61
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:22,078
Please leave the stage.

62
00:09:22,239 --> 00:09:27,677
<i>This blackguard's an impostor!
I am the Baron Munchausen!</i>

63
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:34,278
- We are presenting a performance.
- You're presenting a mockery!

64
00:09:34,439 --> 00:09:40,992
You present me as if I were
a ridiculous fiction, a joke!

65
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:48,757
What the devil's going on?

66
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:58,471
Curtain!

67
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,987
Get off!

68
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:06,912
You're ruining the show!

69
00:10:07,079 --> 00:10:10,867
Do something.
I must talk with my audience.

70
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:15,154
Ladies and gentlemen...

71
00:10:15,319 --> 00:10:21,235
I must apologise for this dreadful
occurrence. I can assure you...

72
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:28,433
- Hello.
- Hello.

73
00:10:28,599 --> 00:10:32,478
Beautiful ladies.

74
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:37,797
- Hello.
- Beautiful ladies.

75
00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:44,034
- You have great taste, sir.
- Otherwise, it's all quite wrong.

76
00:10:44,199 --> 00:10:49,478
- Listen, we've got a show to do...
- Good Lord! Berthold!

77
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:51,630
Who's Berthold?

78
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:56,827
How on earth...?
It's marvellous to see you.

79
00:10:56,999 --> 00:11:00,071
How are your legs?

80
00:11:00,239 --> 00:11:03,948
Where are the others? Albrecht!

81
00:11:04,119 --> 00:11:10,752
Adolphus! Gustavus! I can't
believe it. This is miraculous.

82
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:17,631
- I'm Bill.
- Is he still here? Get rid of him.

83
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:23,237
- What is the matter?
- We'll start the second act afresh.

84
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:27,187
- Who is this?
- Some old lunatic.

85
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:34,515
<i>- He is Baron Munchausen.
- The real Baron Munchausen.</i>

86
00:11:37,239 --> 00:11:41,517
Yes, indeed.
Who, sir, may I ask, are you?

87
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:47,117
A public servant. I am responsible
for the licensing of this theatre.

88
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:51,716
This is the Right Ordinary
Horatio Jackson.

89
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:55,713
He happens to be winning the war
and saving the city.

90
00:11:55,879 --> 00:11:57,870
Please leave us!

91
00:11:58,039 --> 00:12:04,194
He's an ass!
Only I can end this war.

92
00:12:04,359 --> 00:12:09,274
<i>I can end it because I began it.
I am the cause.</i>

93
00:12:09,439 --> 00:12:14,433
I'm afraid, sir, you have
rather a weak grasp of reality.

94
00:12:14,599 --> 00:12:19,229
Your reality, sir,
is lies and balderdash.

95
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:24,951
I am delighted to say
I have no grasp of it whatsoever!

96
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:35,398
- This man needs a doctor.
- A doctor?

97
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:41,358
We will continue with the show.
Thank you, Your Ordinariness.

98
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,148
Right, off.
Please, be reasonable.

99
00:12:45,319 --> 00:12:52,191
If we don't get on with it,
he will throw us to the Turks.

100
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:04,872
My Lords, ladies and gentlemen,
Baron Munchausen at your service.

101
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:08,111
Found any noses recently?

102
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:11,316
Give us a song!

103
00:13:11,479 --> 00:13:15,028
Most of you won't remember me
or my adventures.

104
00:13:15,199 --> 00:13:20,398
But I assure you, they are true.

105
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:25,792
The truth is,
I am the cause of this siege.

106
00:13:25,959 --> 00:13:29,235
- What about the Turks then?
- This is a border dispute.

107
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:35,190
- We're fighting for sea routes.
- That was last time.

108
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:38,829
You poor, deluded fools.

109
00:13:38,999 --> 00:13:44,312
If you'll do me the courtesy of
accepting the word of a gentleman, -

110
00:13:44,479 --> 00:13:51,635
- I will reveal
the true cause of this war.

111
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:55,989
After my... Oh, dear...

112
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:58,832
After my return from Egypt -

113
00:13:58,999 --> 00:14:05,154
- I was most warmly welcomed
by the Grand Turk.

114
00:14:05,319 --> 00:14:07,549
His Highness the Sultan.

115
00:14:07,719 --> 00:14:14,352
He knew of my reputation
and held me in high esteem.

116
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:17,909
He was so delighted
with my company -

117
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:22,436
- that he offered me access
to his harem.

118
00:14:22,599 --> 00:14:29,471
One day, he brought me a bottle
of his favourite Tokay.

119
00:14:56,799 --> 00:15:00,314
- What do you think of that?
- Not bad.

120
00:15:00,479 --> 00:15:04,677
My dear Munchausen,
it's impossible to find better.

121
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:07,558
Humbug!

122
00:15:07,719 --> 00:15:13,669
I can procure for you, within the
hour, a Tokay far superior to this -

123
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:19,596
- from the imperial cellar in
Vienna, a mere 1,000 miles away.

124
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:25,356
Accept my challenge! If I don't
succeed, you may cut off my head.

125
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,670
- What are your stakes?
- I accept.

126
00:15:28,839 --> 00:15:34,630
I wager as much treasure
as the strongest man can carry.

127
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:40,317
Agreed! Give me pen and ink
and I'll write to the Empress.

128
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:49,672
Berthold!

129
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:57,710
Coming!
Blast! Sorry chaps, I've got to go.

130
00:16:17,999 --> 00:16:21,150
Take this to Vienna,
to the Empress.

131
00:16:21,319 --> 00:16:27,349
She will give you a bottle of wine.
Bring it straight to me.

132
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:17,189
Would you care for a little light
entertainment while you wait?

133
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:34,114
I composed a short opera. Would you
like to hear it? You'll love it.

134
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:39,876
It's a comedy. It's called
"The Torturer's Apprentice".

135
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,949
Here's the overture.

136
00:18:02,159 --> 00:18:05,151
The curtain...

137
00:18:05,639 --> 00:18:09,393
The curtain rises
on a typical torture chamber.

138
00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:14,269
Yosrick, the young apprentice,
sings of his joy in his job.

139
00:18:14,439 --> 00:18:20,071
<i>A torturer's apprentice went
his merry way to work one day</i>

140
00:18:20,239 --> 00:18:23,276
<i>I bend and stretch
and ply my trade</i>

141
00:18:23,439 --> 00:18:25,953
<i>making people all afraid</i>

142
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:31,751
<i>but business is slack
there's no one on the rack but me.</i>

143
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:40,198
Act four is set in an abattoir...
I see a lot of slapstick.

144
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:45,114
We begin with the eunuch's chorus:
Cut off in my prime.

145
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:49,033
<i>Mçein Herz, mein Herz.</i>

146
00:18:49,959 --> 00:18:56,478
<i>Cut off in my prime
surrounded by beautiful women</i>

147
00:18:56,639 --> 00:19:04,592
<i>a eunuch's life is hard...</i>

148
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:21,873
- Excuse me a moment.
- You won't want to miss this aria.

149
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:32,508
<i>Life is rather like a game</i>

150
00:19:32,679 --> 00:19:36,149
<i>it's important that you win...</i>

151
00:19:53,239 --> 00:19:55,469
Don't know.

152
00:19:55,639 --> 00:20:01,987
If he's not here in 3½ minutes,
the Sultan will cut off my head.

153
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,593
Is that all?

154
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:07,990
Sorry, I don't find that funny.
Do you?

155
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:13,074
- This isn't a joke, it's a wager.
- A wager?

156
00:20:13,239 --> 00:20:17,949
He's asleep. I can hear him snoring,
about 900 miles away.

157
00:20:24,919 --> 00:20:29,629
He's under a tree. Near Belgrade.

158
00:20:29,799 --> 00:20:34,475
- There's a bottle beside him.
- I hope he hasn't been at it.

159
00:20:34,639 --> 00:20:40,748
- What's the wind speed, Gus?
- Three knots.

160
00:21:09,439 --> 00:21:13,068
<i>I'm a modern man
these days I find</i>

161
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:16,311
<i>you have to be awfully cruel
to be kind</i>

162
00:21:16,479 --> 00:21:21,234
<i>l'm a modern man
you will agree...</i>

163
00:21:21,399 --> 00:21:24,869
<i>... it's either you or me.</i>

164
00:21:27,879 --> 00:21:31,667
Time's nearly up, I think.

165
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:47,317
Ready...

166
00:21:56,479 --> 00:21:58,470
Now!

167
00:22:12,879 --> 00:22:16,918
- Not late, am I?
- No, not late, thank you very much.

168
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:22,868
Thanks, I needed a trim.

169
00:22:24,479 --> 00:22:28,950
- Much obliged.
- From the Empress.

170
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:46,829
Delicious. You win.

171
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:53,871
Treasurer, take from the treasury as
much as the strongest man can carry.

172
00:23:21,719 --> 00:23:24,711
Yep, that's it!

173
00:23:58,639 --> 00:24:01,949
Thanks, squire.

174
00:24:25,159 --> 00:24:29,914
- What is it?
- They've taken everything.

175
00:24:55,639 --> 00:25:00,269
- Gustavus.
- Stop them!

176
00:25:11,479 --> 00:25:17,236
- Bring them back!
- Gustavus! Again!

177
00:25:27,399 --> 00:25:29,390
Fire!

178
00:25:34,639 --> 00:25:38,348
Take cover, my friends!

179
00:25:41,559 --> 00:25:44,631
Regroup!

180
00:25:57,999 --> 00:26:03,790
And so, as you can see,
the Sultan is still after my head.

181
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:15,035
Wait! Stop! Don't go.
Come back, there's more.

182
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:20,072
I haven't finished! Don't leave now.

183
00:26:24,839 --> 00:26:27,672
Gustavus, Adolphus, Albrecht!

184
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:32,071
We're about to make off
with the Sultan's treasure.

185
00:26:32,239 --> 00:26:35,276
- Berthold!
- The name's Desmond!

186
00:26:35,439 --> 00:26:40,991
We're actors, not figments
of your imagination. Get a grip.

187
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:46,517
Come back!
Come back!

188
00:26:48,919 --> 00:26:53,151
What is the Sultan playing at?
It's Wednesday, isn't it?

189
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:56,516
I'm terribly sorry
about the show...

190
00:26:56,679 --> 00:27:02,629
This theatre is closed. You and
your company must leave the city.

191
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:05,791
But look at these endorsements.

192
00:27:05,959 --> 00:27:09,793
"Mr. Salt's company holds a mirror
up to nature." Vienna Clarion.

193
00:27:09,959 --> 00:27:15,158
"Great value." Paris Echo.
"A good night out." Glasgow Herald.

194
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:34,954
Good boy... it's all right.

195
00:27:36,879 --> 00:27:40,189
Here boy.

196
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:05,794
Are you all right?

197
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:16,278
- Am I dead?
- No.

198
00:29:16,439 --> 00:29:22,514
- Blast!
- Who are you really?

199
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:26,308
Baron Munchausen isn't real.
He's only in stories.

200
00:29:26,479 --> 00:29:31,030
- Go away! I'm trying to die.
- Why?

201
00:29:31,199 --> 00:29:35,715
Because I'm tired of the world.

202
00:29:35,879 --> 00:29:42,114
- And the world is tired of me.
- But why? Why?

203
00:29:42,279 --> 00:29:45,112
Why? Why? Why?

204
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:50,273
Because it's all logic
and reason now.

205
00:29:50,439 --> 00:29:54,148
Science. Progress.

206
00:29:55,359 --> 00:30:00,638
Laws of hydraulics.
Laws of social dynamics.

207
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:04,872
Laws of this, that and the other.

208
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:11,717
No place for a three-legged Cyclops
from the South Seas.

209
00:30:11,879 --> 00:30:18,876
No place for cucumber trees
and oceans of wine.

210
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:21,155
No place for me!

211
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:23,992
What happened in the story?

212
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:27,868
In the Sultan's palace.
Did you escape? Were you killed?

213
00:30:28,039 --> 00:30:32,669
I don't know.
It was all a long time ago.

214
00:30:32,839 --> 00:30:36,229
- Who cares?
- I do.

215
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:41,036
I'm very tired...

216
00:30:41,199 --> 00:30:45,078
- Goodbye.
- Please tell me.

217
00:30:45,239 --> 00:30:50,154
- Go on.
- Buzz off!

218
00:30:52,439 --> 00:30:59,675
<i>- Please.
- You really want to know?</i>

219
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:05,109
Stop it!

220
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:09,636
Stop it! We'll all be killed!

221
00:31:09,799 --> 00:31:13,189
Then we'll never know
the end of the story.

222
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:17,238
Where are you going? Come back!

223
00:31:18,199 --> 00:31:20,997
Stop it!

224
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:26,995
Wait! Come back! Take cover!

225
00:31:31,839 --> 00:31:34,034
Wretched child!

226
00:32:10,519 --> 00:32:14,148
Stop it!

227
00:32:15,639 --> 00:32:18,711
Get away! Stop it!

228
00:32:18,879 --> 00:32:21,029
Head down!

229
00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:26,958
- You'll get us both killed.
- I thought you wanted to die.

230
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:30,156
Yes, but I'm old enough.

231
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:36,030
Gentlemen, don't you think you
should silence those enemy cannon?

232
00:32:37,439 --> 00:32:40,715
- No, sir.
- No?

233
00:32:40,879 --> 00:32:45,794
- It's Wednesday.
- Wednesday!

234
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:14,469
The Turks
are about to storm the walls.

235
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:20,077
You really are Baron Munchausen.

236
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:36,152
This is the end. It's all over.

237
00:34:36,319 --> 00:34:42,872
Generations of theatrical expertise
snuffed out.

238
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:47,033
Sally?

239
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:50,350
Get off!

240
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:56,667
Sally, come here.
You cretinous, senile old fart!

241
00:34:58,519 --> 00:35:02,307
Thanks to you,
we're to be thrown to the Turks.

242
00:35:02,479 --> 00:35:06,995
But he is Baron Munchausen.
The real one!

243
00:35:07,159 --> 00:35:10,151
- You must believe me.
- Hurry!

244
00:35:10,319 --> 00:35:13,914
Honestly! He is.

245
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:19,073
- Shut up!
- But he is... and he can save us.

246
00:35:19,239 --> 00:35:24,711
Can't you? He jumped onto
a cannon ball. He really did.

247
00:35:24,879 --> 00:35:30,033
He flew miles into the sky above
the elephants and soldiers.

248
00:35:30,199 --> 00:35:34,750
- Stop lying!
- I'm not lying! Am I?

249
00:35:34,919 --> 00:35:39,709
- As a matter of fact, you are.
- But he did!

250
00:35:41,159 --> 00:35:45,869
The soldiers saw him, too.
They'll tell you.

251
00:35:46,039 --> 00:35:49,554
Oh, they're dead.

252
00:35:49,719 --> 00:35:53,234
- But he did!
- No, I didn't.

253
00:35:53,399 --> 00:35:58,109
- Now you're lying.
- I never lie.

254
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:07,512
Sally, stay here.
What's got into you?

255
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:15,032
I didn't fly miles.

256
00:36:15,199 --> 00:36:20,319
It was more like a mile and a half.
And I didn't precisely fly.

257
00:36:20,479 --> 00:36:25,075
I merely held onto a mortar shell
in the first instance -

258
00:36:25,239 --> 00:36:28,515
- and then a cannon ball
on the way back.

259
00:36:28,679 --> 00:36:31,796
You maniac! You've done for us.

260
00:36:31,959 --> 00:36:37,238
It doesn't matter now, the Turks
are about to take the town.

261
00:36:43,039 --> 00:36:49,194
I was just coming into my prime,
between Romeo and King Lear.

262
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:53,955
My public will kill me
for dying at a time like this.

263
00:36:54,119 --> 00:36:58,032
Save us!

264
00:36:58,879 --> 00:37:02,667
Don't disappoint me.

265
00:37:03,439 --> 00:37:07,796
- You are a baron, aren't you?
- You're our only hope.

266
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:14,478
<i>- You are my only hope.
- Ladies, please...</i>

267
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:17,554
As long as I, -

268
00:37:17,719 --> 00:37:22,235
- Heronomous Carl Frederick
Baron von Munchausen, -

269
00:37:22,399 --> 00:37:26,472
- live and breathe,
you shall come to no harm.

270
00:37:26,639 --> 00:37:31,918
You so remind me
of Catherine the Great, -

271
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:35,196
- whose hand in marriage
I once declined.

272
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:37,793
They all remind you?

273
00:37:37,959 --> 00:37:43,033
Yes, why not?
Bits here and bits there.

274
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:49,035
I have a plan!
I will set forth immediately...

275
00:37:51,239 --> 00:37:55,437
...and find my
extraordinary servants.

276
00:37:55,599 --> 00:38:00,229
With their help, I'll raise
the siege and save the town.

277
00:38:00,399 --> 00:38:04,108
- Brilliant, very good, bravo!
- How?

278
00:38:04,279 --> 00:38:09,433
- I shall require your assistance.
- Of course.

279
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:16,198
- Just tell us what to do.
- Kindly remove your knickers.

280
00:38:49,159 --> 00:38:51,354
Look at all that underwear.

281
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:55,512
Isn't it beautiful?
It's like a dream come true.

282
00:38:56,239 --> 00:39:01,916
It's the dawning of the age
of lovely, intimate things.

283
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:04,468
He'll kill himself.

284
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:10,908
- Yeah, but it'd be well worth it.
- Enough nattering. Keep pumping.

285
00:39:26,319 --> 00:39:29,516
- Better report this.
- You're right.

286
00:39:42,399 --> 00:39:49,510
No... We need a very simple plan.
These are far too complicated.

287
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:54,878
The actors have an air balloon.
They're trying to escape.

288
00:39:55,999 --> 00:39:58,911
Arrest them at once.

289
00:39:59,079 --> 00:40:04,199
- Throw them out of the town.
- We can't open the gates, sir.

290
00:40:04,359 --> 00:40:08,477
- Throw them over the walls then.
- Yes, sir.

291
00:40:09,399 --> 00:40:14,553
Escaping, really! What would
future generations think of us?

292
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:25,311
Right, follow me.

293
00:40:56,999 --> 00:41:00,753
Bring the ladder over here.

294
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:08,477
Baron!

295
00:41:08,639 --> 00:41:12,552
- Have you seen Sally?
- No!

296
00:41:14,519 --> 00:41:18,194
- Thank you, my dear.
- Stop! You're under arrest!

297
00:41:18,359 --> 00:41:21,078
Let go! Let go!

298
00:41:30,839 --> 00:41:34,275
Take aim... Fire!

299
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:46,311
I shall return with reinforcements.
Don't lose heart.

300
00:41:46,479 --> 00:41:53,510
For all those ladies to whom I'm
indebted for half a ton of linen:

301
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:56,637
<i>Don't catch cold! Au revoir.</i>

302
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:03,996
- Stay, Argus! I'll soon be back.
- I will wait for you!

303
00:42:06,559 --> 00:42:08,834
Come back soon.

304
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:21,510
He won't get far
on hot air and fantasy.

305
00:42:33,639 --> 00:42:36,437
Blast!

306
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:41,309
Hang on!

307
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:55,035
- Thanks.
- Now you've ruined everything.

308
00:42:55,199 --> 00:43:00,512
I'll have to douse the fires
and let you down.

309
00:43:00,679 --> 00:43:05,799
- I'm going with you.
- I absolutely and utterly refuse!

310
00:43:05,959 --> 00:43:09,747
If we go down now,
we'll land on the church.

311
00:44:07,999 --> 00:44:15,189
- We've got to find your servants.
- That is what I had in mind.

312
00:44:44,519 --> 00:44:47,511
- Where are we going?
- To the moon.

313
00:44:47,679 --> 00:44:50,671
What? That'll take ages.

314
00:44:50,839 --> 00:44:54,718
- No, it won't.
- Of course it will.

315
00:44:54,879 --> 00:45:00,511
- Why are we going there?
- That's where I last saw Berthold.

316
00:45:00,679 --> 00:45:04,115
- Have you ever been to the moon?
- No.

317
00:45:04,279 --> 00:45:09,433
Interesting place.
The King and Queen are charming.

318
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:15,196
You know about
their detachable heads, don't you?

319
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:23,312
Their heads engage in intellectual
pursuits away from the body.

320
00:45:23,479 --> 00:45:30,237
The trouble is, heads and bodies
don't always see eye to eye.

321
00:45:32,439 --> 00:45:38,435
- You do believe me, don't you?
- I'm doing my best.

322
00:45:54,039 --> 00:45:56,872
Are you scared?

323
00:45:57,039 --> 00:46:00,315
Certainly not.

324
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:05,272
- Are you?
- Certainly not.

325
00:46:26,759 --> 00:46:29,717
Grab the rope!

326
00:47:40,239 --> 00:47:43,436
We're here.

327
00:47:43,919 --> 00:47:47,309
You look different. Younger.

328
00:47:47,479 --> 00:47:51,074
I always feel rejuvenated
by a touch of adventure.

329
00:47:51,239 --> 00:47:57,872
Don't you get any younger,
or we'll have to find a wet nurse.

330
00:48:06,999 --> 00:48:11,515
You'll find that I'm one of
the King's special favourites.

331
00:48:11,679 --> 00:48:15,228
We shall receive a royal welcome.

332
00:48:52,719 --> 00:48:55,187
Now what?

333
00:48:56,519 --> 00:48:59,636
I've got you, at last.

334
00:48:59,799 --> 00:49:02,916
<i>- Bienvenuto alla luna.
- Your Majesty!</i>

335
00:49:03,079 --> 00:49:06,310
What a great pleasure
to see you again.

336
00:49:06,479 --> 00:49:12,998
May I introduce my friend Sally.
Sally, King of the Moon.

337
00:49:13,159 --> 00:49:20,349
<i>My full title is King of Everything.
Re di tutto. You can call me Ray.</i>

338
00:49:20,519 --> 00:49:26,708
The moon is an insignificant part
of my domain. There's much more.

339
00:49:28,359 --> 00:49:32,750
You seem to be in some discomfort.
What ails you?

340
00:49:32,919 --> 00:49:37,754
Nothing ails me. Can you not see
that I am at one with the cosmos?

341
00:49:39,399 --> 00:49:46,032
Is that all you can say?
What are you, blind?

342
00:49:46,199 --> 00:49:50,192
Let me explain it:
Since you were last here, my head, -

343
00:49:50,359 --> 00:49:53,749
- where the brilliant parts
are located, -

344
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:57,036
- is now ruling the known universe.

345
00:49:57,199 --> 00:50:01,078
And what I don't know, I create.

346
00:50:03,559 --> 00:50:09,475
I just created spring. Seriously,
without me there would be nothing.

347
00:50:09,639 --> 00:50:14,508
"Cogito ergo es."
I think, therefore you is.

348
00:50:15,199 --> 00:50:17,474
He's a lunatic.

349
00:50:17,639 --> 00:50:22,918
So it seems. He's certainly fallen
prey to delusions of grandeur.

350
00:50:23,079 --> 00:50:26,549
Keeping in tune
with the whole universe -

351
00:50:26,719 --> 00:50:29,392
- requires much concentration.

352
00:50:29,559 --> 00:50:32,710
So having you on the loose
does not help.

353
00:50:32,879 --> 00:50:36,633
Your stories distract me.

354
00:50:36,799 --> 00:50:39,836
You are like a mosquito
in the Taj Mahal.

355
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:45,795
My Liege, without my adventures,
you wouldn't be here.

356
00:50:45,959 --> 00:50:50,794
Well, so I am now
part of your adventures?

357
00:50:50,959 --> 00:50:54,156
We shall see about that.

358
00:51:10,359 --> 00:51:15,479
<i>Now, who created who?
I hope you'll be comfortable. Ciao!</i>

359
00:51:15,639 --> 00:51:19,712
There's my revolting body
with the Queen!

360
00:51:19,879 --> 00:51:23,269
Stop it! I'm tired.

361
00:51:23,439 --> 00:51:26,749
Go away!
Damn it, he can't hear me.

362
00:51:26,919 --> 00:51:30,195
You stinking, horrible man!

363
00:51:30,359 --> 00:51:34,750
It's so embarrassing.
Don't look, maybe he'll go away.

364
00:51:34,919 --> 00:51:38,992
Imagine we were once attached.
We're totally incompatible.

365
00:51:39,159 --> 00:51:43,471
He's dangling from the food chain
and I am in the stars.

366
00:51:43,639 --> 00:51:49,157
No, go away,
I despise you!

367
00:52:00,799 --> 00:52:04,189
I'm back!
I got lips again.

368
00:52:04,359 --> 00:52:10,628
And I'm gonna use them, baby.
It's me, I'm your elephant of joy!

369
00:52:13,759 --> 00:52:18,787
- Let me kiss you, baby.
- Eat first, darling.

370
00:52:18,959 --> 00:52:22,998
That's right!
First eat then kiss!

371
00:52:24,239 --> 00:52:27,311
I need this stuff.

372
00:52:28,519 --> 00:52:32,307
You can't do that
when you don't got no mouth.

373
00:52:33,039 --> 00:52:36,236
I'm back in business.

374
00:52:37,959 --> 00:52:40,871
You don't go nowhere.

375
00:52:45,519 --> 00:52:49,797
- Baron!
- Your most Wondrous Majesty!

376
00:52:49,959 --> 00:52:52,154
I know you.

377
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:56,915
You're the little guy that tried
to make off with my queen.

378
00:52:57,079 --> 00:53:01,072
<i>No more of that, piccolo Casanova.</i>

379
00:53:01,239 --> 00:53:04,515
What are you looking at?

380
00:53:08,719 --> 00:53:14,908
Here you go, lovebirds!
I'm sure you'll be uncomfortable.

381
00:53:25,239 --> 00:53:30,188
Free again,
to concentrate on higher things.

382
00:53:33,639 --> 00:53:37,552
Crawl back in the slime.
Missed me!

383
00:53:37,719 --> 00:53:42,474
I'm blind!
My kingdom for a handkerchief!

384
00:53:42,639 --> 00:53:50,478
No, let me go! I haven't time
for flatulence and orgasms.

385
00:53:50,639 --> 00:53:53,836
Please, no more bodily functions.

386
00:53:57,959 --> 00:54:00,553
Farewell, Baron.

387
00:54:11,959 --> 00:54:17,955
- "One of the King's favourites"?
- This cage isn't real.

388
00:54:18,119 --> 00:54:23,751
- It's part of the King's lunacy.
- It seems solid enough to me.

389
00:54:23,919 --> 00:54:29,551
I see we're in a
not very helpful frame of mind.

390
00:54:29,719 --> 00:54:32,756
The town is perfectly all right.

391
00:54:32,919 --> 00:54:37,151
- The assault is over. They're safe.
- How do you know?

392
00:54:37,319 --> 00:54:40,356
I just know.

393
00:54:49,159 --> 00:54:55,314
What the devil...
All right, I'm coming.

394
00:54:56,959 --> 00:55:00,156
Come out of there.

395
00:55:04,839 --> 00:55:08,275
- Come out of there.
- Ow! Stop that.

396
00:55:08,439 --> 00:55:11,909
- Why did you do that?
- I thought you might be unfriendly.

397
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:16,436
<i>Of course I am! You'd be unfriendly,
if I prodded you.</i>

398
00:55:16,599 --> 00:55:19,830
Who are you?

399
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:26,111
- I can't remember.
- That'll be us, if we don't escape!

400
00:55:26,279 --> 00:55:31,114
- Why are you here?
- I'm a very wicked criminal.

401
00:55:31,279 --> 00:55:34,715
- What have you done?
- I can't remember.

402
00:55:34,879 --> 00:55:40,033
- How do you know you're wicked?
- Well, for one thing...

403
00:55:40,199 --> 00:55:44,158
l'm in here.
And for another...

404
00:55:44,319 --> 00:55:47,356
l've got these shackles on.

405
00:55:47,519 --> 00:55:50,192
Berthold!

406
00:55:50,359 --> 00:55:54,398
It's Berthold!

407
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:57,153
It's me, the baron!

408
00:55:57,319 --> 00:56:03,997
I knew I'd find you. You must come
back to Earth and fight the Sultan.

409
00:56:04,159 --> 00:56:07,037
You're Berthold, my old servant.

410
00:56:07,199 --> 00:56:11,272
The leg irons are to slow you down.

411
00:56:11,439 --> 00:56:14,954
- You're joking.
- You always wore them, remember?

412
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:20,830
- You're crackers!
- I'm Baron Munchausen.

413
00:56:20,999 --> 00:56:24,469
We're wasting time!

414
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:35,235
- Darling Baron!
- Ariadne!

415
00:56:35,399 --> 00:56:39,312
I'm sorry
we couldn't speak before, -

416
00:56:39,479 --> 00:56:43,108
- but Roger's so difficult.

417
00:56:43,279 --> 00:56:46,635
Where exactly is Roger?

418
00:56:46,799 --> 00:56:50,838
In bed with my body, of course.

419
00:56:50,999 --> 00:56:54,309
<i>Stop it! Stop it!</i>

420
00:56:54,479 --> 00:56:57,994
If he discovers
my head's with you...

421
00:56:58,159 --> 00:57:02,755
Quickly, climb into my hair.

422
00:57:03,879 --> 00:57:07,110
Why's she making
those funny noises?

423
00:57:08,639 --> 00:57:14,874
Her body's with the King,
and he's...

424
00:57:15,039 --> 00:57:18,475
...tickling her feet.

425
00:57:18,999 --> 00:57:23,629
- Berthold, you're coming with us.
- No chance!

426
00:57:23,799 --> 00:57:28,190
- Why not? Are you frightened?
- That's it!

427
00:57:28,359 --> 00:57:30,827
Come on, help me.

428
00:57:32,919 --> 00:57:36,434
Quickly, climb aboard.

429
00:57:39,679 --> 00:57:45,356
- Hold tight!
- I don't want to escape!

430
00:57:59,519 --> 00:58:05,958
I love this!
I'll tickle you till dawn, darling.

431
00:58:06,119 --> 00:58:09,236
I'll wipe everything away.
Tickly, tickly...

432
00:58:10,999 --> 00:58:16,357
I know you love this,
but you don't say anything.

433
00:58:16,519 --> 00:58:19,556
You're a pillow biter, that's it.

434
00:58:26,639 --> 00:58:31,918
Baron, I must get back to Roger
before he notices I'm headless.

435
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:37,790
- I quite understand.
- Darling, take me with you.

436
00:58:37,959 --> 00:58:42,032
- Back to Earth?
- Yes, oh yes!

437
00:58:43,719 --> 00:58:46,791
Without your body?

438
00:58:47,359 --> 00:58:52,831
- I thought you loved me for myself!
- I did... I mean, I do.

439
00:58:52,999 --> 00:58:56,071
- It's just...
- We have to go!

440
00:58:56,239 --> 00:59:01,359
I think you're right.
It's impossible.

441
00:59:01,519 --> 00:59:04,795
Take a lock of my hair.

442
00:59:06,879 --> 00:59:10,315
Just a lock, Cocky!
Not the whole carpet.

443
00:59:10,479 --> 00:59:15,837
- I shall treasure it always.
- The King! I must go...

444
00:59:15,999 --> 00:59:19,594
<i>Au revoir, my dear baron.</i>

445
00:59:23,719 --> 00:59:28,873
Yes! I'm coming, Roger!

446
00:59:29,839 --> 00:59:33,878
I'm going to drive you to China.
Let it out!

447
00:59:34,039 --> 00:59:36,758
My God! Where is your head?

448
00:59:36,919 --> 00:59:42,277
No wonder you're so quiet.
I'm too rough, I knocked it off.

449
00:59:42,439 --> 00:59:45,636
I'll find it.
We'll play "Head and Seek".

450
00:59:45,799 --> 00:59:51,112
Oh, you play a trick?
Darling, come out!

451
00:59:51,279 --> 00:59:57,912
You're not here. Where are you?
You're with the baron.

452
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:01,037
You are with that little man.

453
01:00:01,199 --> 01:00:05,795
<i>You told me size
makes no difference. You puttana!</i>

454
01:00:05,959 --> 01:00:10,749
That's it! I'll find your baron,
and then I'll kill you.

455
01:00:16,399 --> 01:00:18,549
Faster!

456
01:00:18,719 --> 01:00:22,758
<i>I'll make a baron brochette!
Sybil, andiamo!</i>

457
01:00:28,639 --> 01:00:31,107
Faster!

458
01:00:31,279 --> 01:00:34,476
We can't.
Berthold can hardly move.

459
01:00:34,639 --> 01:00:38,678
- Take his weights off.
- I have!

460
01:00:38,839 --> 01:00:45,790
- He's old. He can't run anymore.
- Nonsense, he's out of practice.

461
01:00:49,679 --> 01:00:52,910
Come on, Berthold.

462
01:00:54,439 --> 01:00:59,274
Look for him!
Nowhere to hide for you, Baron.

463
01:00:59,439 --> 01:01:03,637
What are you looking at?
Look down there!

464
01:01:05,079 --> 01:01:08,151
There he is, Sybil! Down there!

465
01:01:08,319 --> 01:01:11,550
I've got you now, Baron.

466
01:01:30,679 --> 01:01:34,991
There they are!
Are you hungry, my darling?

467
01:01:35,159 --> 01:01:37,468
<i>You take the baron,
you the bald one, -</i>

468
01:01:37,639 --> 01:01:43,157
- and you take the little girl,
because you're my favourite. Dinner!

469
01:01:47,759 --> 01:01:52,753
- You go this way, I'll go that way.
- You're the last of your species.

470
01:01:55,919 --> 01:01:58,752
No, don't split up on me now!

471
01:02:00,239 --> 01:02:03,276
Mayday!

472
01:02:03,439 --> 01:02:05,907
We're going down!

473
01:02:08,279 --> 01:02:12,158
Sybil, don't desert me now.

474
01:02:23,519 --> 01:02:27,671
I'm free! I'm free at last.
The body is dead.

475
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:33,232
<i>The body's dead, long live the head.
It's finished, finito!</i>

476
01:02:33,399 --> 01:02:40,191
I shall prove a head does not need
a body to survive. I am omnipotent!

477
01:02:40,359 --> 01:02:43,635
Oh no, I've got an itch!

478
01:02:54,879 --> 01:02:58,633
Well done, Sally.

479
01:02:59,159 --> 01:03:05,553
Baron Munchausen!
How great to see you!

480
01:03:05,719 --> 01:03:09,951
- Get off me!
- It's Berthold, your old servant.

481
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:13,907
Yes, we've been through all that.

482
01:03:14,079 --> 01:03:17,071
- Where are we?
- On the moon.

483
01:03:17,239 --> 01:03:21,790
- Oh yeah? Same old baron, eh?
- Can we go now?

484
01:03:21,959 --> 01:03:24,678
Get weaving!

485
01:03:24,839 --> 01:03:28,593
Hang on...
It's all coming back.

486
01:03:28,759 --> 01:03:34,868
I've been stuck here for 20 years.
Ever since you were last here.

487
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:38,076
You abandoned me here.
You swine!

488
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:43,472
You went off with the Queen of Tarts
and left me to rot in a cage.

489
01:03:43,639 --> 01:03:51,353
Now you come back and expect me to
follow you to the ends of the Earth?

490
01:03:51,519 --> 01:03:54,192
Yes.

491
01:03:54,359 --> 01:03:57,271
Oh, all right.

492
01:04:13,879 --> 01:04:18,509
Berthold, do you know
where the rest of the gang are?

493
01:04:18,679 --> 01:04:21,113
Not a clue.

494
01:04:29,239 --> 01:04:33,551
This is the sort of thing
that no one ever believes.

495
01:04:34,319 --> 01:04:37,516
Right, Berthold...

496
01:04:40,559 --> 01:04:42,948
You go first, -

497
01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:46,350
- then Sally.

498
01:04:51,559 --> 01:04:54,153
Careful.

499
01:04:56,679 --> 01:05:00,035
Off you go.

500
01:05:10,319 --> 01:05:15,677
<i>That's it! Finito.
There's no more rope.</i>

501
01:05:15,839 --> 01:05:20,788
- I'm coming back up.
- Wait a moment.

502
01:05:20,959 --> 01:05:25,316
- Tie this to the end.
- Where did you get this?

503
01:05:25,479 --> 01:05:28,710
- I cut it from the top.
- From the top?

504
01:05:28,879 --> 01:05:33,669
Where else do you think I'd get it?
Yes, yes, yes...

505
01:05:33,839 --> 01:05:38,196
Splice it to the end
so we may continue our descent.

506
01:05:38,359 --> 01:05:43,513
Very clever! Great.
Why didn't I think of that?

507
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:48,799
That's why he's a baron,
and I'm a prole.

508
01:05:52,079 --> 01:05:54,547
We'll never rescue them now!

509
01:06:02,799 --> 01:06:04,994
2 ½ percent!

510
01:06:05,159 --> 01:06:08,834
- That's not enough.
- That's all I'm offering.

511
01:06:16,519 --> 01:06:20,831
2 ½ percent!
Take it or leave it.

512
01:06:26,239 --> 01:06:30,152
We want more!
We want more!

513
01:06:37,639 --> 01:06:40,153
I'm still in one piece!

514
01:06:40,319 --> 01:06:43,948
- I think...
- I can't imagine why.

515
01:06:44,119 --> 01:06:48,192
Our descent into
the volcano of Mt. Etna -

516
01:06:48,359 --> 01:06:53,228
- should have been slowed
by a rising cushion of warm air.

517
01:06:53,399 --> 01:06:56,357
The damn thing
seems to have gone out.

518
01:06:56,519 --> 01:06:59,955
Oh, no! Not more giants!

519
01:07:02,879 --> 01:07:06,508
Can I help you tiny mortals?

520
01:07:06,679 --> 01:07:11,230
I sincerely hope so.
I'm Baron Munchausen.

521
01:07:13,039 --> 01:07:17,271
You may have heard of me.
We're looking for three men.

522
01:07:17,439 --> 01:07:22,388
One with exceptional eyesight,
one with superb hearing, -

523
01:07:22,559 --> 01:07:26,598
- and one who's
extremely large and strong.

524
01:07:27,279 --> 01:07:32,478
Oh, we're all
extremely large and strong here!

525
01:07:41,159 --> 01:07:45,755
I am Vulcan. The god.

526
01:07:45,919 --> 01:07:51,516
And these are my giant employees.

527
01:07:52,479 --> 01:07:58,156
The Cyclops. Who even now
are going back to work!

528
01:08:02,199 --> 01:08:07,717
I supply arms and equipment
to anyone who will pay the price.

529
01:08:07,879 --> 01:08:11,792
Greeks, Trojans, Romans, Huns...

530
01:08:11,959 --> 01:08:17,352
It's not my fault they're crazy
enough to slaughter each other.

531
01:08:17,519 --> 01:08:23,276
You manky crew! Your go-slows
don't impress me, I'm God!

532
01:08:23,439 --> 01:08:29,958
I have all the time in the universe.
Hear that? All the time, me!

533
01:08:30,119 --> 01:08:34,192
In the old days the staff got paid
every 1,000 years.

534
01:08:34,359 --> 01:08:39,479
This lot expects it every century.
It's outrageous!

535
01:08:39,639 --> 01:08:44,110
- What's this?
- This is our prototype...

536
01:08:44,279 --> 01:08:47,954
RX intercontinental, -

537
01:08:48,119 --> 01:08:52,351
- radar-sneaky,
multi-warheaded, nuclear missile.

538
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:58,398
What does it do?

539
01:08:58,559 --> 01:09:01,995
<i>- It kills the enemy.
- All the enemy?</i>

540
01:09:02,159 --> 01:09:09,110
All of them. All their wives,
children, sheep, cats and dogs...

541
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:15,434
- All of them, gone for good.
- That's horrible!

542
01:09:17,839 --> 01:09:20,307
Well, you see...

543
01:09:20,479 --> 01:09:26,475
The advantage is, you don't have to
see one single one of them die.

544
01:09:26,639 --> 01:09:32,111
You just sit comfortably, thousands
of miles from the battlefield, -

545
01:09:32,279 --> 01:09:36,033
- and simply press the button.

546
01:09:36,199 --> 01:09:39,828
Where's the fun in that?

547
01:09:41,719 --> 01:09:44,711
We cater for all sorts here.

548
01:09:44,879 --> 01:09:47,473
You'd be surprised...

549
01:09:47,639 --> 01:09:51,757
Would you care for
a little fodder, perhaps?

550
01:10:03,319 --> 01:10:05,469
Delicious!

551
01:10:05,639 --> 01:10:10,952
It's not bad tea,
as far as nectar of the gods goes.

552
01:10:11,119 --> 01:10:17,194
You can stay as long as you like.
It's nice to have company for tea.

553
01:10:17,359 --> 01:10:21,068
I'm sorry, but we have to go soon.

554
01:10:21,239 --> 01:10:24,709
We're in a hurry!

555
01:10:26,039 --> 01:10:32,751
<i>Here comes my midget manservant
with the petits fours.</i>

556
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:39,188
- Albrecht!
- Baron! Berthold!

557
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:42,669
- What are you doing here?
- Looking for you.

558
01:10:42,839 --> 01:10:46,912
I haven't got the treasure.
I spent... gave it to charity.

559
01:10:47,079 --> 01:10:52,995
I don't want the treasure.
Albrecht, this is Sally.

560
01:10:54,399 --> 01:10:57,789
I want you
to come and fight the Turk.

561
01:10:57,959 --> 01:11:02,271
No, I couldn't do that.
Not since I've found myself.

562
01:11:02,439 --> 01:11:07,718
I didn't really want to
be big and strong and carry things.

563
01:11:07,879 --> 01:11:11,633
Now I know
I want to be dainty and sensitive.

564
01:11:11,799 --> 01:11:15,792
They call me the midget down here.
I love it.

565
01:11:16,599 --> 01:11:19,989
He's gone funny.

566
01:12:11,079 --> 01:12:13,070
Hello.

567
01:12:56,719 --> 01:13:01,668
My darling... my dearest!

568
01:13:07,559 --> 01:13:12,679
Excuse me. May I introduce
Baron Munchausen, -

569
01:13:12,839 --> 01:13:18,118
- and his little friend Sally,
and...

570
01:13:18,279 --> 01:13:21,271
...Berthold.

571
01:13:21,439 --> 01:13:25,796
And this is Venus.

572
01:13:25,959 --> 01:13:29,588
The goddess. My wife.

573
01:13:30,719 --> 01:13:34,917
Madam, I am overwhelmed.

574
01:13:38,879 --> 01:13:42,508
My love, my life.

575
01:13:42,679 --> 01:13:47,514
Alpha and omega of my existence!
I have something for you.

576
01:14:08,119 --> 01:14:10,553
A diamond.

577
01:14:10,719 --> 01:14:14,155
For you, my precious.

578
01:14:14,319 --> 01:14:17,550
You're so sweet.

579
01:14:17,719 --> 01:14:20,677
<i>Another diamond.</i>

580
01:14:25,919 --> 01:14:32,711
Madam, I am alas unable
to offer you so splendid a gift, -

581
01:14:32,879 --> 01:14:39,910
- but may I say, your beauty excels
even Catherine the Great, -

582
01:14:40,079 --> 01:14:44,914
- whose hand in marriage
I once had the honour of declining.

583
01:14:45,079 --> 01:14:48,549
- Baron, you flatter me.
- Not one jot, madam!

584
01:14:48,719 --> 01:14:52,189
Not one tittle!

585
01:15:01,279 --> 01:15:04,237
What a handsome...

586
01:15:04,399 --> 01:15:07,516
...moustache.

587
01:15:08,799 --> 01:15:12,269
Shall we... dance?

588
01:15:40,599 --> 01:15:43,955
Come and see the ballroom.

589
01:15:44,119 --> 01:15:47,191
Come and see the ballroom.

590
01:16:13,599 --> 01:16:18,150
Nice, isn't it?
We've just had it done.

591
01:16:18,319 --> 01:16:21,868
Do you know that?

592
01:16:31,839 --> 01:16:35,149
I can dance.
Here, watch this.

593
01:17:23,239 --> 01:17:27,152
- Sally, you can dance, can't you?
- No.

594
01:17:27,319 --> 01:17:30,470
Thanks a lot.

595
01:17:40,119 --> 01:17:42,474
Stop!

596
01:17:43,239 --> 01:17:46,549
Baron!

597
01:17:47,199 --> 01:17:50,589
Can we go now?

598
01:17:50,759 --> 01:17:53,796
Hello!

599
01:17:56,479 --> 01:18:01,872
Stop it! Come down!

600
01:18:02,519 --> 01:18:08,674
We've got to get back
and save the town.

601
01:18:10,039 --> 01:18:16,672
- Please, Baron!
- Don't fret. The town is safe.

602
01:18:40,479 --> 01:18:43,994
The baron's kissing your wife.

603
01:18:48,599 --> 01:18:52,274
I mean, what?

604
01:19:18,679 --> 01:19:26,359
You're a harlot! Whore!
Do you hear? Whore, whore!

605
01:19:28,359 --> 01:19:32,511
That's enough, you strumpet.

606
01:19:34,679 --> 01:19:37,477
No, wait, please...

607
01:19:37,639 --> 01:19:41,632
- But, darling!
- Don't you "darling" me!

608
01:19:45,519 --> 01:19:49,512
Do something. Save him!

609
01:19:50,799 --> 01:19:56,669
- Darling, don't be jealous.
- Jealous? I'm not jealous.

610
01:19:58,079 --> 01:20:01,355
Give him back to me!

611
01:20:03,079 --> 01:20:08,472
- You never let me have friends.
- Don't wiggle at men, you floozy!

612
01:20:08,639 --> 01:20:12,029
- Floozy?
- Sir, I must assure you...

613
01:20:12,199 --> 01:20:18,195
<i>- I'm a goddess! I can do as I like.
- And I am the god, so shut up!</i>

614
01:20:21,679 --> 01:20:24,671
Excuse me...

615
01:20:26,239 --> 01:20:29,629
Ungrateful mortal!

616
01:20:29,799 --> 01:20:34,668
- You'll pay for this!
- I insist the lady is blameless.

617
01:20:38,999 --> 01:20:43,868
Please, put the baron down.
He's always like that.

618
01:20:52,399 --> 01:20:59,794
- What have you done to them?
- You small-minded petty bourgeois!

619
01:21:00,879 --> 01:21:04,872
- What have you done to the baron?
- You want the baron?

620
01:21:05,039 --> 01:21:10,557
- You can have the baron!
- No thanks, it's okay...

621
01:21:22,079 --> 01:21:24,877
Did you enjoy that?

622
01:21:27,079 --> 01:21:30,708
Did I excite you?

623
01:22:50,879 --> 01:22:54,315
Oh, damn! I can't swim.

624
01:22:59,839 --> 01:23:04,037
What's happening?
You've got old again.

625
01:23:04,199 --> 01:23:09,432
Well, I've just been expelled
from bliss. And it's your fault!

626
01:23:09,599 --> 01:23:11,988
Where are we?

627
01:23:12,159 --> 01:23:14,753
Answer me!

628
01:23:14,919 --> 01:23:18,753
The most probable explanation -

629
01:23:18,919 --> 01:23:24,551
- is that we dropped through the
world's centre to the South Seas.

630
01:23:24,719 --> 01:23:29,235
- That's miles away.
- Oh, well done!

631
01:23:29,399 --> 01:23:33,278
- I was happy in my volcano.
- So was I.

632
01:23:33,439 --> 01:23:36,590
An island!

633
01:23:37,839 --> 01:23:44,028
- Is there a volcano on it?
- Shut up about your volcanoes!

634
01:23:45,159 --> 01:23:48,754
<i>I think there is a volcano on it.</i>

635
01:23:54,159 --> 01:23:56,150
It's moving!

636
01:23:56,319 --> 01:24:03,634
- I spy something starting with "M".
- It's a demon of the deep!

637
01:24:03,799 --> 01:24:08,953
That starts with "D", you klutz.
"M"...for monster!

638
01:24:14,759 --> 01:24:20,072
- Will it eat us?
- With any luck.

639
01:25:32,079 --> 01:25:35,867
Baron!

640
01:25:41,039 --> 01:25:44,315
Quick, give me a hand.

641
01:25:44,479 --> 01:25:49,030
- He looks dead to me.
- He can't be dead.

642
01:25:55,519 --> 01:25:59,910
He doesn't look very perky,
does he?

643
01:26:00,079 --> 01:26:03,515
Is there a doctor in the fish?

644
01:26:04,359 --> 01:26:08,989
No doctors... no doctors.

645
01:26:10,359 --> 01:26:15,877
- We've got to get him warm and dry.
- What's that noise?

646
01:26:16,039 --> 01:26:20,078
It's... music.

647
01:26:20,239 --> 01:26:23,231
That's not music.

648
01:26:23,399 --> 01:26:25,913
Look!

649
01:26:26,079 --> 01:26:30,231
There's a light. Come on!

650
01:26:36,039 --> 01:26:40,317
This way... careful!

651
01:27:21,439 --> 01:27:24,476
Excuse me!

652
01:27:26,479 --> 01:27:32,031
We need some help.

653
01:27:34,359 --> 01:27:40,275
- We need some help.
- No doctors!

654
01:27:42,279 --> 01:27:46,238
Do I hear the baron?

655
01:27:46,399 --> 01:27:49,152
Eh?

656
01:27:49,319 --> 01:27:51,992
Do I hear the baron?

657
01:27:52,159 --> 01:27:56,232
- No doctors!
- Do I hear the baron?

658
01:27:56,399 --> 01:28:01,268
I just said that.
Use your trumpet!

659
01:28:05,359 --> 01:28:09,830
Adolphus. Gustavus.
Is it really you?

660
01:28:09,999 --> 01:28:15,631
- Baron! Berthold! Albrecht!
- I don't believe it.

661
01:28:20,039 --> 01:28:26,558
This is Adolphus. He could hit a
bull's-eye halfway round the world.

662
01:28:26,719 --> 01:28:31,713
This is Gustavus, who could
blow over a forest with one breath.

663
01:28:31,879 --> 01:28:39,672
Those were the days, eh?
When we were young... and alive.

664
01:28:41,119 --> 01:28:44,748
- How do you mean?
- It's no good fighting it.

665
01:28:44,919 --> 01:28:48,468
- We're not dead.
- You have to accept it.

666
01:28:48,639 --> 01:28:51,995
We're all dead here.
This is Hell.

667
01:28:52,159 --> 01:28:56,118
- Heaven!
- Hell!

668
01:28:56,279 --> 01:28:59,749
Don't be stupid!

669
01:28:59,919 --> 01:29:03,992
Sit down, relax.
Have a game.

670
01:29:04,159 --> 01:29:08,994
You're dead for a very long time.

671
01:29:14,599 --> 01:29:18,353
What are you doing?

672
01:29:18,519 --> 01:29:21,670
You're giving up, aren't you?

673
01:29:21,839 --> 01:29:27,118
- You can't, I won't let you!
- Go away, clear off.

674
01:29:30,159 --> 01:29:35,358
What about Rose and Daisy,
and my father and all the others?

675
01:29:35,519 --> 01:29:41,116
- You promised to help them.
- They are perfectly safe.

676
01:29:46,159 --> 01:29:50,311
They can look after themselves.

677
01:29:53,159 --> 01:29:57,437
Besides,
there are more important things.

678
01:29:57,599 --> 01:29:59,715
Such as?

679
01:30:16,239 --> 01:30:20,357
You horrible little brat!

680
01:30:23,199 --> 01:30:27,511
Can't you let me die in peace
once in a while?

681
01:30:53,559 --> 01:30:58,474
Bucephalos! My Bucephalos.

682
01:31:00,079 --> 01:31:03,276
You must have heard me shouting.

683
01:31:03,919 --> 01:31:09,357
- This is a good omen, what?
- Oh, yeah...

684
01:31:11,199 --> 01:31:15,397
Prepare a rowing boat.
Be ready to leave.

685
01:31:18,159 --> 01:31:25,509
I have learned that a modicum
of snuff can be most efficacious.

686
01:32:28,559 --> 01:32:31,596
I'll never eat fish again.

687
01:32:33,399 --> 01:32:37,870
- Where's the baron?
- Baron?

688
01:32:50,279 --> 01:32:53,794
Baron, where are you?

689
01:33:02,799 --> 01:33:05,791
It's the baron.

690
01:33:11,199 --> 01:33:15,829
Well, come on!
I can't keep this up forever.

691
01:33:37,919 --> 01:33:42,868
Look, the town!
We're here.

692
01:33:48,039 --> 01:33:54,228
Yes, and the flag's still flying.
I told you not to worry.

693
01:33:57,719 --> 01:34:03,510
My God, it's the Sultan's army.
Quick, back in the fish!

694
01:34:06,199 --> 01:34:10,795
They're inviting us to defeat them.
We must oblige them.

695
01:34:10,959 --> 01:34:13,109
On the count of three...

696
01:34:14,839 --> 01:34:18,354
Gustavus!
Blow them back to Asia Minor.

697
01:34:18,519 --> 01:34:21,636
Adolphus!
Find the Sultan and shoot him.

698
01:34:21,799 --> 01:34:29,114
Albrecht, row us ashore.
Berthold... make yourself useful.

699
01:34:29,279 --> 01:34:33,033
You couldn't make that four?

700
01:34:33,199 --> 01:34:36,236
We're going down!

701
01:34:37,639 --> 01:34:41,473
Abandon ship!
Abandon ship!

702
01:34:41,639 --> 01:34:44,995
I think the ship's abandoning us.

703
01:35:03,359 --> 01:35:06,988
I still can't swim.

704
01:35:14,999 --> 01:35:18,071
This is absolutely dreadful.

705
01:35:18,239 --> 01:35:23,757
I've never been in such a rout.
I'm usually on the winning side.

706
01:35:23,919 --> 01:35:29,152
- You're too competitive.
- Albrecht's useless.

707
01:35:29,319 --> 01:35:36,669
<i>- We might as well give up.
- You mustn't say that! Not you!</i>

708
01:35:41,999 --> 01:35:47,756
If we attack from two directions, we
confound surprise with confusion.

709
01:35:47,919 --> 01:35:52,868
Albrecht and Gustavus will provide
the major themes, while...

710
01:35:53,039 --> 01:35:57,237
- Baron.
- Don't interrupt. What is it?

711
01:35:57,399 --> 01:36:00,391
This isn't going to work.

712
01:36:00,559 --> 01:36:05,872
They're old and tired now.
It isn't like it used to be.

713
01:36:07,079 --> 01:36:10,549
Don't you see?

714
01:36:15,919 --> 01:36:21,118
- Where are you going?
- To give myself up.

715
01:36:21,279 --> 01:36:26,751
I gave my word I would raise the
siege and gathered you all here.

716
01:36:31,079 --> 01:36:36,107
If you want to see Baron Munchausen
again, do something about it!

717
01:36:39,479 --> 01:36:44,109
You can't give yourself up.
They might kill you.

718
01:36:44,279 --> 01:36:50,514
And then we spent all that time
in that smelly fish for nothing.

719
01:37:19,519 --> 01:37:25,310
Agreed. Friday 28th, you surrender.
That's three weeks from tomorrow.

720
01:37:25,479 --> 01:37:29,472
<i>- We can fix the details later.
- No, you surrender!</i>

721
01:37:29,639 --> 01:37:34,793
<i>- We've discussed it. You surrender.
- But we're winning!</i>

722
01:37:34,959 --> 01:37:40,591
We surrendered last time.
Now it's your turn.

723
01:37:40,759 --> 01:37:46,789
- What about the virgins?
- Forget them. We're out of virgins.

724
01:37:46,959 --> 01:37:51,510
Let us concentrate on
reaching a civilised agreement -

725
01:37:51,679 --> 01:37:55,228
- that can secure a world fit for
science, progress...

726
01:37:55,399 --> 01:37:58,835
But not Baron Munchausen!

727
01:37:58,999 --> 01:38:02,594
- You old lunatic!
- I'm afraid so.

728
01:38:02,759 --> 01:38:08,789
Help, murder!
Who let this man into my tent?

729
01:38:08,959 --> 01:38:13,635
If you are still interested
in my head... it's yours.

730
01:38:13,799 --> 01:38:17,587
- I'm tired of it.
- Send for the executioner!

731
01:38:17,759 --> 01:38:21,752
So, Mr. Jackson,
still the rational man?

732
01:38:21,919 --> 01:38:26,151
How many people have perished
in your logical little war?

733
01:38:26,319 --> 01:38:33,509
There are rules in life. We cannot
fly to the moon or defy death.

734
01:38:33,679 --> 01:38:39,868
We must face facts, not folly.
You don't live in the real world -

735
01:38:40,039 --> 01:38:43,714
- and so, you come
to a very sticky end.

736
01:39:20,279 --> 01:39:24,875
- Have you any famous last words?
- Not yet.

737
01:39:25,039 --> 01:39:31,638
- "Not yet"? Is that famous?
- The man's a buffoon.

738
01:39:33,359 --> 01:39:37,193
Executioner!
Execute.

739
01:40:06,799 --> 01:40:10,155
He did it!

740
01:40:19,919 --> 01:40:23,355
General, stop that man!

741
01:40:43,319 --> 01:40:47,232
I knew we could do it!
All together now.

742
01:41:11,039 --> 01:41:13,951
Well blown, Gustavus.

743
01:41:28,919 --> 01:41:33,834
- They're coming.
- Come on, go on! Hurry!

744
01:42:16,239 --> 01:42:19,834
Berthold, run.

745
01:43:16,119 --> 01:43:20,351
Make yourself useful!
I can't do everything.

746
01:43:24,959 --> 01:43:27,553
This way.

747
01:43:38,279 --> 01:43:40,713
That's the way!

748
01:44:50,959 --> 01:44:54,713
Gently this time.

749
01:44:54,879 --> 01:44:57,439
Gently!

750
01:46:44,159 --> 01:46:48,232
We did it! We did it!

751
01:47:04,119 --> 01:47:10,467
Look, they don't believe it.
We've won! We've won!

752
01:47:19,559 --> 01:47:22,949
- Come back!
- We've won.

753
01:47:23,119 --> 01:47:25,838
But of course.

754
01:48:30,759 --> 01:48:33,557
Put me down!

755
01:48:44,759 --> 01:48:48,434
He's in the church tower.

756
01:48:59,759 --> 01:49:03,752
There he is, shoot him!

757
01:49:03,919 --> 01:49:07,912
Bring a doctor! Quickly!

758
01:49:08,079 --> 01:49:14,712
- Don't leave me, Baron. Please!
- Get off him. Give him some air.

759
01:49:18,079 --> 01:49:22,072
Here is the doctor.

760
01:49:24,599 --> 01:49:29,957
- Take care of Sally.
- No doctors...

761
01:49:31,279 --> 01:49:33,839
No doctors.

762
01:49:50,879 --> 01:49:54,110
Get away! Leave him alone!

763
01:49:57,119 --> 01:50:00,555
Sally's having a fit.

764
01:50:05,879 --> 01:50:09,030
Stop it!

765
01:50:18,999 --> 01:50:21,832
He's dead.

766
01:51:24,199 --> 01:51:29,068
...that was only one of the
many times I met my death.

767
01:51:29,239 --> 01:51:35,348
An experience which I don't hesitate
strongly to recommend.

768
01:51:35,519 --> 01:51:40,035
And so, with the help of my
inestimable servants, -

769
01:51:40,199 --> 01:51:44,078
- I defeated the Turks
and saved the day.

770
01:51:44,239 --> 01:51:49,597
And from that time forth,
everyone who had a talent for it -

771
01:51:49,759 --> 01:51:52,796
- lived happily ever after.

772
01:51:52,959 --> 01:51:56,588
Stop this nonsense at once!

773
01:51:56,759 --> 01:51:58,875
You are under arrest -

774
01:51:59,039 --> 01:52:02,918
- for spreading ridiculous tales
at a time of danger, -

775
01:52:03,079 --> 01:52:06,355
- with the enemy at the gate.
Arrest him.

776
01:52:06,519 --> 01:52:09,511
Open the gates.

777
01:52:10,759 --> 01:52:14,718
I order you
to arrest that man at once.

778
01:52:14,879 --> 01:52:18,758
Am I not the elected representative?

779
01:52:18,919 --> 01:52:23,470
- Arrest him!
- Open the gates.

780
01:52:24,799 --> 01:52:27,233
This way!

781
01:52:28,039 --> 01:52:32,908
- Come on.
- Do not open the gates!

782
01:52:33,079 --> 01:52:36,196
The Turk is outside.
We will not surrender.

783
01:52:37,159 --> 01:52:41,072
Open the gates.

784
01:52:42,079 --> 01:52:46,595
Come on, dear ladies.
Forward the players!

785
01:52:46,759 --> 01:52:52,595
- Do not open the gates.
- Keep up. Steady as you go.

786
01:52:52,759 --> 01:53:00,188
Come back, I'm warning you!
Do not open those gates.

787
01:53:02,119 --> 01:53:04,758
Follow me!

788
01:53:11,839 --> 01:53:17,516
- The gates will remain closed.
- Open the gates.

789
01:53:17,679 --> 01:53:21,274
Shoot anyone
who disobeys my orders.

790
01:53:24,119 --> 01:53:27,555
Hold your ground, hold your ground!

791
01:53:27,719 --> 01:53:34,591
Open the gates, dear friends,
and let's seize the day.

792
01:53:34,759 --> 01:53:42,074
Nothing destroys a man as ignorance
and conformity. Grasp the mantle!

793
01:53:43,159 --> 01:53:46,754
No, no, no! Quite wrong.

794
01:53:46,919 --> 01:53:50,355
Open the gates!

795
01:53:50,839 --> 01:53:53,876
Shoot them!

796
01:53:56,199 --> 01:53:59,794
Shoot these people at once!

797
01:54:06,999 --> 01:54:11,356
So! It's treason, is it?

798
01:54:13,039 --> 01:54:20,878
Right, you're all under arrest.
All of you!

799
01:55:07,679 --> 01:55:11,354
Bucephalos. My Bucephalos.

800
01:55:23,519 --> 01:55:26,636
Beautiful ladies...

801
01:55:27,399 --> 01:55:31,108
Beautiful ladies...

802
01:55:46,679 --> 01:55:50,877
It wasn't just a story... was it?

803
02:00:29,319 --> 02:00:33,710
