01:20:01,201 --> 01:20:02,970
Um, Maxine called me like
100 fucking times.

1733
01:20:03,070 --> 01:20:04,104
She's on the phone right now,
she says.

1734
01:20:04,204 --> 01:20:05,674
If I don't hand you the phone,

1735
01:20:05,774 --> 01:20:07,975
then she's going to cut
my dick off, so...

1736
01:20:08,909 --> 01:20:10,578
Oh, jeez.

1737
01:20:12,313 --> 01:20:13,715
Hi, Maxine.

1738
01:20:13,814 --> 01:20:15,482
London, there you are. I've been
trying to get a hold of you.

1739
01:20:15,583 --> 01:20:17,117
Hold on. I don't know.

1740
01:20:17,217 --> 01:20:19,019
I do not know how to fix her
nose. Get a fucking chainsaw.

1741
01:20:19,119 --> 01:20:21,055
I don't know. Hey, okay,
I need to talk to you.

1742
01:20:21,155 --> 01:20:25,627
I don't want to have this talk.
I already know I fucked up.

1743
01:20:25,727 --> 01:20:27,127
I'm sorry.

1744
01:20:27,227 --> 01:20:28,462
I just had a long conversation
with the director,

1745
01:20:28,563 --> 01:20:31,999
and at first he did
not see you as Batman.

1746
01:20:32,099 --> 01:20:33,934
He didn't, you know,
he couldn't envision it

1747
01:20:34,034 --> 01:20:36,136
because the physicality
and I told him I was like, look,

1748
01:20:36,236 --> 01:20:38,238
we can put him on steroids,
we can get him calf implants.

1749
01:20:38,339 --> 01:20:40,107
We can do all
the fucking shit, right?

1750
01:20:40,207 --> 01:20:42,943
He didn't get it until he saw
that video of you getting

1751
01:20:43,043 --> 01:20:44,546
punched in the face,
which he thought

1752
01:20:44,646 --> 01:20:47,481
that you staged
for him, which...

1753
01:20:47,582 --> 01:20:49,149
What?

1754
01:20:49,249 --> 01:20:52,687
But the point is, he fucking
bought it hook, line and sinker.

1755
01:20:52,787 --> 01:20:57,091
And you are the next
fucking Batman.

1756
01:20:57,191 --> 01:20:59,993
-Shut the...
-I know.

1757
01:21:00,094 --> 01:21:01,195
I mean, look,
there's still a lot of like,

1758
01:21:01,295 --> 01:21:02,597
you know, hammering out
that I could do

1759
01:21:02,697 --> 01:21:03,997
with the vaginas
of business affairs.

1760
01:21:04,098 --> 01:21:06,768
But those cunts, they know me,
they know me.

1761
01:21:06,867 --> 01:21:08,902
I have to... I have to call you
back. Yes, okay.

1762
01:21:09,002 --> 01:21:09,937
You're going to be a fucking
little action figure.

1763
01:21:10,037 --> 01:21:11,506
You're going to be.

1764
01:21:11,606 --> 01:21:13,173
Little kids are going to put
you in microwaves and shit

1765
01:21:13,273 --> 01:21:15,643
because you are
going to be fucking Batman.

1766
01:21:15,744 --> 01:21:17,478

1767
01:21:17,579 --> 01:21:19,880
I mean, you know what I mean?
I don't really.

1768
01:21:19,980 --> 01:21:21,348
I just... I'm proud of you.

1769
01:21:21,448 --> 01:21:25,152
Okay, I love you, too.
What? What?

1770
01:21:25,252 --> 01:21:27,888
Please don't get canceled.
Please...

1771
01:21:27,988 --> 01:21:29,890
I got the role.

1772
01:21:29,990 --> 01:21:31,225
-I'm fucking Batman.
-No!

1773
01:21:31,325 --> 01:21:32,727
I'm Batman!

1774
01:21:32,827 --> 01:21:34,729
Oh, sick, dude.

1775
01:21:34,829 --> 01:21:36,397

Can I have my phone.

1780
01:21:43,705 --> 01:21:45,840
I'm sorry, here.

1781
01:21:45,939 --> 01:21:47,509
Did you look at my photos?

1782
01:21:47,609 --> 01:21:49,977
No, no.

1783
01:21:50,077 --> 01:21:52,580
This has been the weirdest
first day at work ever.

1784
01:21:52,680 --> 01:21:56,917
Looks like it's about time
for you to hop on out of here.

1785
01:21:57,017 --> 01:21:58,318
See you guys.

1786
01:21:59,687 --> 01:22:02,256
I... I got to call Apple.

1787
01:22:02,356 --> 01:22:04,124
I got to try. I'm
sorry, I don't want

1788
01:22:04,224 --> 01:22:05,926
to kill the vibe, but like...

1789
01:22:06,026 --> 01:22:08,028
Maybe she'll answer.

-Hold on, I just... can we talk?
<i>-What?</i>

1793
01:22:16,503 --> 01:22:18,807
Like no arguing, just...

1794
01:22:18,907 --> 01:22:22,544
just I want to
tell you something and...

1795
01:22:22,644 --> 01:22:25,379
I'm sorry about today.

1796
01:22:25,479 --> 01:22:27,448
Do you remember where
we had our first kiss?

<i>Yeah.</i>

1798
01:22:28,817 --> 01:22:30,350

-Okay.

All right.
I'm on my way. Bye.

1801
01:22:35,590 --> 01:22:36,825
She's going to see you?

1802
01:22:36,925 --> 01:22:38,593
Yeah.

1803
01:22:38,693 --> 01:22:40,829
What the fuck just happened
in the last 35 seconds?

1804
01:22:40,929 --> 01:22:42,463
You're Batman.

01:22:42,564 --> 01:22:44,465
I'm Batman!
