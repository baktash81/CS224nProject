Some of my best editing on that one.

707
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:49,240
Definitely some of our best editing.

708
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:52,682
So, do you guys do this kind of thing often?
This ghost hunting?

709
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:54,046
All the time.

710
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:57,169
Yeah. It's actually all we do.

711
01:01:57,240 --> 01:02:00,722
We literally don't
do anything else. Just this.

712
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:03,321
So what happens now?

713
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:05,565
Probably five, maybe four.

714
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:08,561
Excuse me?

715
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:13,846
And I have to call you back.
I'm just with some peeps.

716
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:15,160

01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:18,011
Come on. She's in here.

719
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:19,721
Thank you. Pass the trash.

720
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:20,841
Here you go.

721
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:23,806
Thanks.

722
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:26,161
Excuse me.

723
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:34,609
TUCKER: Now, this
custom-made camera of mine

724
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:36,250
is outfitted with a small lens.

725
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:38,723
Basically a hidden camera.

726
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:40,848
It's not basic and it's not hidden.

727
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:42,650
'Cause we're keeping it
right out in the open

728
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:44,609
to capture whatever
may occur tonight.

729
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:46,330
We do hide it though, sometimes.

01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:52,361

This is our sound backup.

01:02:57,240 --> 01:03:00,642

- Nothing.

735
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:05,682
You just go to sleep
like you normally would.

736
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:10,124
(ECHOING) We are
the ones who stay awake.

737
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:20,166
Hello, Elise.

738
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:22,891
It's been too long.

739
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:26,322
I save you for special occasions.

740
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:36,287
That's her.

741
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:40,046
She says one day, eventually,

742
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:41,804
I'm going to die by her hand,

743
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:44,086
and I believe her.

744
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:47,642
That's why I had to stop using my gift.

745
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:51,244
But now I'm realizing

746
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:54,925
my gift is all I have.

747
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:57,764
(VOICE BREAKING) It's all I am.

748
01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:02,206
First of all, okay,
you are more than one thing.

749
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:06,008
And, second,
you've been helping people

750
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:08,128
get rid of these spirits for so long.

751
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:10,762
Well, eventually,
one of them was gonna come after you.

752
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:13,650
You can't be afraid of her.

753
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:16,968
All right, you're stronger than her.

754
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:20,290
You're alive.

755
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:21,771
Yes, I'm alive.

756
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:24,088
But I have spent more time on this earth

757
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:26,083
among the dead than the living.

758
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:30,931
Do you really think we help people, Carl?

759
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,365
We do what we can.

760
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:36,208
If someone gets attacked
by a person on the street,

761
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:38,567
they can go to the police.

762
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:41,564
If they're attacked
by something they can't see,

763
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:43,881
something they can't comprehend,

764
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:46,201
they only have people like us to go to.

765
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:47,327
Here.

766
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:53,288
Look at what you did for that family.

767
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:55,207
You saved them.

768
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:59,169
That boy is a grown man now
with a son of his own.

769
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,163
I don't want you to stop
helping families like them.

770
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:05,004
They need you too much.

This entity is very powerful.

01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:11,563
It's a spirit who used to
live in this building a long time ago.

846
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:13,569
It's been alone for a long time.

847
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:16,764
But she's making it stronger.

848
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:19,800
It's feeding on her life force.

849
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:21,925
And wants to possess her?

850
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:26,645
Usually, entities of this type,
living in the dark,

851
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:29,530
they want to possess
the bodies of the living

852
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:32,809
so that they can
leave the dark and return to life.

853
01:12:35,720 --> 01:12:37,927
But there's another kind of a spirit.

854
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:44,765
It's an even worse kind.

855
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:49,046
One that does not wanna leave the dark,

856
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:53,446
that wants the souls of the living
to join it in the shadows.

She's only half a person right now.

858
