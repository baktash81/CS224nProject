00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:59,554
I have tricks
in my pocket.

7
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:01,973
I have things up my sleeve.

8
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:04,642
But I am the opposite
of a stage magician.

9
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:08,354
He gives you illusion which has
the appearance of truth,

10
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:12,817
and I give you truth in the
pleasant disguise of illusion.

11
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:17,363
To begin with,
I turn back time.

12
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:20,533
I reverse it
to that quaint period,

13
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:21,701
the '30s,

14
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:25,663
when the huge middle class
of America was matriculating

15
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:26,915
in a school for the blind.

16
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:31,419
Their eyes had failed them,
or they had failed their eyes,

17
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:35,423
and so were having their fingers
pressed forcibly down

18
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:39,719
on the fiery brail alphabet
of a dissolving economy.

19
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:42,513
In Spain there was revolution.

20
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:45,892
Here there was only
shouting and confusion.

21
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:48,478
In Spain there was Guernica.

22
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:51,648
Here there were
disturbances of labor,

23
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:53,524
sometimes pretty violent,

24
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:56,402
in otherwise peaceful cities
such as Chicago,

25
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:58,738
Cleveland and St. Louis.

26
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:03,910
This is the social background
of the play.

27
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:04,786
The play is memory.

28
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:06,955
Being a memory play,

29
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:09,958
it is dimly lighted.

30
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,460
It is sentimental.

31
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,920
It is not
realistic.

32
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:14,796
(fiddle playing)

33
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:16,547
In memory,

34
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,925
everything seems
to happen to music.

35
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:21,636
That explains
the fiddle in the wings.

36
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:25,640
I am the narrator of the play,
and also a character in it.

37
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:29,060
The other characters
are my mother, Amanda,

38
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,937
My sister, Laura,

39
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:34,732
and a gentleman caller
who appears in the final scenes.

40
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:38,069
He is the most
realistic character in the play,

41
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:40,071
being an emissary

42
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:43,950
from a world of reality that
we were somehow set apart from.

43
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,786
But since I have
a poet's weakness for symbols,

44
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:49,622
I use this character
also as a symbol.

45
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:53,376
He is the long-delayed,
but always expected,

46
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:55,378
something that we live for.

47
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,964
There is a fifth character
in the play,

48
00:04:58,006 --> 00:04:59,632
but he only appears

49
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:02,593
in this larger-than-life-size
photograph.

50
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:05,596
This is my father,
who left us a long time ago.

51
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,515
He was a telephone man

52
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,559
who fell in love
with long distances.

53
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,977
He gave up his job

54
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:14,522
with the telephone company

55
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:18,443
and skipped the light fantastic
out of town.

56
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:21,612
The last we heard of him

57
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:23,781
was a picture postcard
from Mazatlan,

58
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,491
on the Pacific Coast of Mexico,

59
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,660
containing a message
of two words.

60
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:29,704
"Hello.

61
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,664
Goodbye."

62
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:33,875
And no address.

63
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:48,473
AMANDA WINGFIELD:
You know, Laura,

64
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:51,726
I had the funniest experience
in church last Sunday.

65
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:54,896
The church was full except for
one pew way down front,

66
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:57,106
and in that was just
one little lady.

67
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:59,776
So I smiled at her very sweetly
and I said,

68
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:01,819
"Excuse me.

69
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:04,030
Would you mind
if I shared this pew?"

70
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:06,115
"I certainly would,"
she said.

71
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:08,451
"This space is rented."

72
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:10,078
(laughing)

73
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:11,954
That's the first time
I ever knew

74
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:13,790
the Lord rented space.

75
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:15,625
These Northern Episcopalians.

76
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,919
I can understand
certain Episcopalians,

77
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,670
but the Northern ones,
no.

78
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:21,255
Oh, honey.

79
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:24,467
Don't push your food
with your fingers.

80
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,054
If you must push your food
with something,

81
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:29,639
The thing to use
is a crust of bread.

82
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:33,684
Oh, tom.

83
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,978
You must chew your food.

84
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:39,899
Honey, animals have secretions
in their stomachs

85
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:43,611
that allow them to digest
their food without mastication.

86
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:46,030
But human beings
must chew their food

87
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:48,533
before they swallow it down.

88
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:49,909
Chew, hmm?

89
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:51,702
Chew.

90
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,955
Honey,

91
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:56,165
Eat leisurely, hmm?

92
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:58,626
Eat leisurely.

93
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:01,879
A well-cooked meal
has many delicate flavors

94
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:05,091
that must be held in the mouth
for appreciation,

95
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:07,468
not just gulped down.

96
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,804
Hmm?

97
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:12,014
So chew.

98
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:14,267
Chew.

99
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:17,228
Don't you want
to give your salivary glands

100
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,938
A chance to function?

101
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,648
TOM WINGFIELD:
Mother.

102
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,066
I have not enjoyed

103
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:23,734
one bite at this dinner

104
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:26,237
because of your constant
directions on how to eat it.

105
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:29,740
It's you that makes me
rush through meals

106
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:32,952
with your hawk-like attention
to every bite I take.

107
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:35,663
It's sickening.

108
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:37,915
It spoils my appetite,

109
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:40,877
all this discussion
of animal secretions,

110
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:43,171
salivary glands,
mastication.

111
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:45,923
Temperament like
a metropolitan star.

112
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,592
(singing)

113
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:49,844
You're not excused
from the table.

114
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:51,762
I'm getting a cigarette.

115
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:53,973
You smoke too much.

116
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:55,641
Mother,

117
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:57,059
I'll bring in the coffee.

118
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:59,645
AMANDA:
No, no, no, no,
You sit down.

119
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:01,063
You sit down.

120
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:03,065
I'm going to be
the colored boy tonight

121
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:04,650
and you're going to be the lady.

122
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:06,861
LAURA WINGFIELD:
Well, no, I'm already up.

123
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,279
AMANDA:
Well, resume your seat.

124
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,489
Resume your seat.

125
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:12,700
Keep yourself fresh and pretty
for the gentlemen callers.

126
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:15,620
LAURA:
I'm not expecting
any gentlemen callers, mother.

127
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:18,039
AMANDA:
Well, honey,
the nice thing about them

128
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,666
is sometimes they come
when they are least expected.

129
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:23,586
Why, I remember one Sunday
afternoon in blue mountain

130
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:25,213
when your mother was a girl.

131
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:28,007
Such a convocation stomped
on our porch,

132
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:30,551
with chocolate and...

133
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:32,929
TOM:
I know what's coming.

134
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,890
LAURA:
Yes, but let her tell it.

135
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:38,726
TOM:
Again?

136
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:41,270
LAURA:
She loves to tell it.

137
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:46,192
AMANDA:
And on that

138
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:48,361
Sunday afternoon
in blue mountain

139
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:50,613
when your mother was a girl,

140
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:52,865
she received
17 gentlemen callers.

141
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:55,284
Sometimes
there weren't enough chairs

142
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:57,370
to accommodate them all,

143
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:59,914
and we had
to send a colored boy

144
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:02,917
over to the parish house
to fetch the folding chairs.

145
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:05,920
TOM:
And how did you entertain
those gentlemen callers?

146
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,423
Well, I happened to understand
the art of conversation.

147
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:10,967
I bet you could talk.

148
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,094
AMANDA:
Well, I could,
I tell you.

149
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:15,096
All the girls in my day could.

150
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:16,722
TOM:
Yes?

151
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:18,140
AMANDA:
Yes.

152
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:21,143
We knew how to entertain
our gentlemen callers.

153
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:23,854
It's not enough for a girl
to be possessed

154
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:26,399
of a pretty face
and a graceful figure,

155
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,235
although I wasn't slighted
in either respect.

156
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:32,196
She also had to have
a nimble wit

157
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:35,074
and a tongue
to meet all occasions.

158
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:36,742
What did you talk about?

159
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:40,746
AMANDA:
Things of importance going on
in the world.

160
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:45,918
Well, never anything coarse
or common or vulgar,

161
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,754
because
my callers were gentlemen,

162
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:52,341
Some of the finest men
on the Mississippi delta.

163
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:55,136
Planters and sons of planters.

164
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:57,430
There was
young Champ Laughlin.

165
00:09:57,471 --> 00:10:00,850
He later became

166
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:04,854
Vice-president
of the Delta Planters' Bank.

167
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:06,731
And the Cutrere brothers.

168
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:08,232
(laughing)

169
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:10,901
Wesley and Bates.

170
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:13,404
Now,

171
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:17,241
Bates was one of
my own bright particular beaus,

172
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,952
but he got into a fight

173
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:22,788
with that wild Wainwright boy.

174
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:26,500
They shot it out on the floor
of the Moon Lake Casino.

175
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,962
Bates was shot
right through the stomach.

176
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:31,839
Died in the ambulance

177
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:34,216
on the way
to Memphis.

178
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:39,221
He left his widow
well provided for too.

179
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:42,391
Some 8,000 or 10,000 acres --
no less.

180
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:44,769
And he never loved that woman.

181
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:47,897
She just caught him
on the rebound.

182
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:51,901
They found my picture on him
the night he died.

183
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:53,903
(sniffling)

184
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:56,030
(sighing)

185
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:59,200
And that boy.

186
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:03,204
That boy
that every girl in the delta

187
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:06,207
had set her cap for.

188
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:10,211
That beautiful,
brilliant young dixie boy

189
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:13,422
from Greene County.

190
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:15,549
Why did
he leave his widow?

191
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:17,885
He never married.

192
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:21,347
What's the matter?

193
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,099
You sound as if
all my old admirers

194
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:25,059
had turned up their toes
to the daisies.

195
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:26,936
Isn't this
the first one you mentioned

196
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,437
that still survived?

197
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:31,315
Well,
he made an awful lot of money.

198
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:34,485
He went north to Wall Street
and he made a fortune.

199
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:37,363
And I could have been
Mrs. J. Duncan Fitzhugh,

200
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,448
mind you.

201
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,534
And what did I do?

202
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:44,453
I just went out of my way
and picked your father.

203
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:46,205
Mother,
let me clear the dishes.

204
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,915
AMANDA:
No, no, no, no.

205
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:49,458
You go over there

206
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,335
and you study
your typewriter chart.

207
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,254
You practice
your shorthand a little.

208
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:55,005
Keep yourself fresh
and pretty,

209
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,549
because it's almost time

210
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,926
for our gentlemen callers
to start arriving.

211
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:00,428
Now,
how many do you think

212
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:02,179
We're going
to entertain today?

213
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:05,474
LAURA:
I don't believe that
we'll be receiving any, mother.

214
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:07,309
AMANDA:
Not any?

215
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:09,186
Not one?

216
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:11,063
Oh, you must be joking.

217
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:12,940
Not
one single gentleman caller?

218
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,817
What's the matter?

219
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:16,527
Has there been a flood
or a tornado?

220
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,362
LAURA:
It's not a flood.

221
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:20,239
It's not a tornado,
mother.

222
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:23,075
I'm just not popular
like you were in Blue Mountain.

223
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:28,414
Mother's afraid
I'm going to be an old maid.

Hello, mother.

229
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:06,076
I was just--

230
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:07,578
Yes.

231
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,498
You were just practicing
your typing, I suppose.

232
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:12,124
Yes.

233
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:18,088
AMANDA:
Deception,
deception, deception.

00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:21,592
LAURA:
How was the D.A.R. meeting,
mother?

235
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:26,055
AMANDA:
D.A.R. meeting?

236
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:28,599
LAURA:
Didn't you go
to the D.A.R. meeting, mother?

237
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,226
AMANDA:
No.

238
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:32,520
I didn't go
to any D.A.R. meeting.

239
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:34,355
I didn't have the strength.

240
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:36,982
I didn't have
the courage.

241
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:40,069
I just wanted to find
a hole in the ground

242
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,279
and crawl in it
and stay there

243
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:44,490
for the rest of my entire life.

244
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,492
LAURA:
Why did you do that, mother?

245
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:48,619
Why?

246
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,996
Why?

247
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:53,165
How old are you,
Laura?

248
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:55,000
mother, you know my age.

249
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:57,711
I was under the impression
you were an adult.

250
00:13:57,711 --> 00:14:00,631
It seems
I was entirely mistaken.

251
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,967
Please don't stare at me,
mother.

252
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:14,979
AMANDA:
What are we going to do?

253
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:18,190
What is going to become of us?

254
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:21,402
What is the future?

255
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:23,028
Mother,
has something happened?

256
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:28,158
Has something happened,
mother?

257
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,411
AMANDA:
I'll be all right in a minute.

258
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:33,664
I am just bewildered
by life.

259
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:36,625
mMother, I wish that you would
tell me what has happened.

260
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:40,462
I went to the D.A.R.,
as you know--

261
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:44,341
I was to be inducted
as an officer--

262
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,176
and I stopped by

263
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:48,304
Rubicam's Business College
on the way

264
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:51,098
to tell them about your cold and
ask how you were doing there.

265
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,474
LAURA:
Oh.

266
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:54,101
Yes.

267
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:55,519
Oh.

268
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,187
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

269
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:59,189
I went straight

270
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:00,608
to your typing instructor,

271
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:02,610
and I introduced myself
as your mother.

272
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:04,361
She didn't know who you were.

273
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:05,738
"Wingfield?" she said.

274
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:07,698
"Why, we don't have
any such scholar

275
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,491
enrolled in this school."

276
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:11,243
I assured her she did.

277
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,662
I said, "Why, my daughter Laura
has been coming here

278
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:15,456
since early January."

279
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,166
"I don't know,"
she said,

280
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:19,501
"Unless you mean
that terribly shy little girl

281
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:22,254
that dropped out after
only a few days attendance."

282
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:24,381
"No," I said.
"I don't mean that one."

283
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:27,217
"I mean my daughter Laura,

284
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:31,138
"Who's been coming here every
day for the past six weeks."

285
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,390
"Well, excuse me,"
she said,

286
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:36,226
and she got down
the attendance record.

287
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,520
There was your name,

288
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,731
Unmistakable,
printed,

289
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:43,275
and every time
you had been absent.

290
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:45,694
And I still told her
she was wrong.

291
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:47,488
I said, "oh, no.

292
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:49,323
"There must be some mistake.

293
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:51,533
There must be some mix-up
in the records."

294
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:53,369
"Oh, no," she said.

295
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:55,162
"I remember her perfectly now.

296
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,830
"She was so shy,

297
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,666
"and her hands shook

298
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:01,418
"so that her fingers
wouldn't strike the right keys.

299
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,504
"And then when we gave her
a speed test,

300
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:06,548
"she just fell apart completely
and was sick to her stomach

301
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:08,550
"and had to be carried
to the washroom.

302
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:10,678
"After that
she never came back anymore.

303
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:12,554
"We called
the house every day,

304
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:14,682
but we never got any answer."

305
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:17,559
That's
when I was working all day long,

306
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:20,437
I suppose,
down at that department store,

307
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,606
demonstrating those...

308
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:26,819
I was so weak
I couldn't stand up.

309
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,363
I had to sit down

310
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:31,782
while they gave me
a glass of water.

311
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:35,077
Fifty dollars tuition.

312
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,538
It's not even the money
so much,

313
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:41,083
but it's all my hopes of
any kind of a future for you

314
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:44,461
just gone out the spout,
just gone out the spout like--

315
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:47,339
Laura, don't you play
that Victrola!

316
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:49,425
Now, what have
you been doing every day

317
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:51,468
when you have
gone out of this house

318
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,096
telling me you were going
to business college?

319
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,723
I just went out walking.

320
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:57,433
That's not true.

321
00:16:57,433 --> 00:17:00,394
Yes, it is, mother.
I just went walking.

322
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:01,812
Walking?
Walking?

323
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,480
In winter?

324
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,816
Deliberately courting pneumonia
in that light coat?

325
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:07,443
Now, where were you walking to?

326
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:08,861
All sorts of places.

327
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:10,654
Mostly in the park.

328
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:14,616
Honey, even after
you started catching that cold?

329
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:17,369
Mother,
it was the lesser of two evils.

330
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:19,580
I couldn't go back.

331
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:21,874
I threw up on the floor.

332
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:24,710
So, from half-past 7:00
in the morning

333
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:27,296
till after 5:00
in the afternoon,

334
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:29,673
you mean to tell me

335
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,759
you went walking around
in the park in order

336
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:34,720
to make me believe you were
still going to business college?

337
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:37,181
LAURA:
Mother,
it wasn't as bad as it sounds.

338
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:39,141
I went inside places
to get warmed up.

339
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:40,517
Inside where?

340
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,395
LAURA:
I went to the art museum

341
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:45,606
and the bird house at the zoo.

342
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:47,816
I visited
the penguins every day.

343
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:51,361
Some days I did without lunch
and I went to the movies.

344
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:53,530
But lately in the afternoons,

345
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:56,909
I've been going to that place
called the jewel-box,

346
00:17:56,909 --> 00:18:00,913
that big glass house where
they raise the tropical flowers.

347
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,706
Honey,

348
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:05,793
you did all this
to deceive me?

349
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:08,420
For deception?

350
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:09,838
Now, why?

351
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:12,633
Why?
Laura, why?

352
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:15,511
Mother,
when you are disappointed,

353
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:19,389
you get that awful
suffering look on your face

354
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:21,558
like the picture
of Jesus' mother in the museum.

355
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,353
I couldn't face it.

356
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:26,939
I couldn't.

357
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:32,402
(sighing)

358
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,949
So,

359
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:39,243
what are we going to do now,
honey,

360
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:41,286
for the rest of our lives?

361
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:43,330
Hmm?

362
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:45,582
We just going
to sit down in this house

363
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:48,794
and watch the parades go by?

364
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:54,675
Amuse ourselves
with the little glass menagerie?

365
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:57,928
Eternally play those
worn-out phonograph records

366
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,305
your father left

367
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:02,558
as a painful reminder of him?

368
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:07,396
We can't have
a business career.

369
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:08,981
No.

370
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:10,816
We can't do that.

371
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:13,485
That just gives us indigestion.

372
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:20,826
So what is there
left for us

373
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:24,329
but dependency all our lives?

374
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:28,542
Laura.

375
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:31,253
Laura.

376
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:33,714
Honey,

377
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:37,384
I know so well
what happens to unmarried women

378
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:40,929
who are not prepared
to occupy a position in life.

379
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:44,933
I've seen such pitiful examples
of it in the South --

380
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:48,979
barely tolerated spinsters
living on some brother's wife

381
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:51,565
or sister's husband,

382
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:55,319
tucked away in
some little mousetrap of a room,

383
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,364
encouraged by one in-law
to go visit another in-law,

384
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:01,950
little birdlike women
without any nest,

385
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:05,829
eating the crust of humility
all their lives.

386
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:09,708
Now, is that the future

387
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,793
we have mapped out
for ourselves?

388
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:13,754
(sighing)

389
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:15,756
I swear,

390
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:18,425
I don't see
any other alternative.

391
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:22,971
I don't think

392
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:25,557
that's
a very pleasant alternative.

393
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:30,854
Of course,
some girls do marry.

394
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:34,983
My goodness, Laura.

395
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:37,069
Haven't you ever liked some boy?

396
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:40,739
Yes.

397
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:42,407
Yes, mother.

398
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:43,825
I liked one once.

399
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:45,410
You did?

400
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:48,789
LAURA:
I came across his picture
a while ago.

401
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:51,083
He gave you his picture too?

402
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:53,502
No.
It's in the yearbook.

403
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:55,045
Oh.

404
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,589
It was a high-school boy.

405
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:59,132
Yes.

406
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,678
His name was Jim.

407
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:19,069
Here he is
in the Pirates of Penzance.

408
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:21,405
AMANDA:
The what?

409
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:24,700
LAURA:
The operetta
the senior class put on.

410
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:27,619
He had a wonderful voice.

411
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:31,498
I used to
sit across the aisle from him

412
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:35,502
Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays
in the auditorium.

413
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:43,677
Here he is
with a silver cup for debating.

414
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:46,722
You see his grin?

415
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:50,392
AMANDA:
So he had a grin too.

416
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:53,979
LAURA:
He used to call me blue roses.

417
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:55,939
AMANDA:
Now,

418
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:58,692
Why did he call you
such a silly name as that?

419
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:03,989
LAURA:
When I had
that attack of pleurosis

420
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:06,116
and I was out of school
for a while.

421
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,785
When I came back,
he asked me what the matter was,

422
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:10,704
and I said, "pleurosis."

423
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,873
Only he thought
that I said

424
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:14,499
AMANDA/LAURA:
Blue roses.

425
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:18,503
LAURA:
So that's what
he always called me after that.

426
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:21,089
Whenever he would see me,

427
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:24,468
He would holler,
"Hello, blue roses."

428
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:28,472
I never cared very much for
the girl that he went out with,

429
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:30,807
Emily Meisenbach.

430
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:34,478
She was the best-dressed girl
at Soldan,

431
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:38,482
but she never struck me
as being sincere.

432
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:46,615
I read once in the newspaper
that they were engaged.

433
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:48,450
That was a long time ago.

434
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:50,202
They're probably married
by now.

435
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:51,995
AMANDA:
Oh.

436
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:53,789
That's all right,
honey.

437
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,582
It's all right.

438
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:57,584
You know,
sometimes when little girls

439
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:59,586
are not cut out
for business careers,

440
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:01,755
they end up married
to very nice young men,

441
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:04,007
and I'm just going to see
that you do that too.

442
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:05,592
LAURA:
Mother.

443
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:06,968
AMANDA:
What?

444
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:08,595
LAURA:
I'm crippled.

445
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:10,597
AMANDA:
Shh!

446
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,516
Now,
don't use that word.

447
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:15,477
How many times have I told you
never to use that word?

448
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:17,479
You are not crippled.

449
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:19,189
You just have
a little defect.

450
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:22,025
Now, if you had lived
in the days when I was a girl,

451
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:24,111
and we went out
to dances every night,

452
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:28,115
and we had those long graceful
skirts sweeping the ground,

453
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:31,701
it might even have
been considered an asset.

454
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:34,037
Honey,

455
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:37,624
when you have
a little disadvantage like that,

456
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:40,669
you just have
to cultivate something else

457
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:43,004
to take its place.

458
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:45,674
You have to cultivate charm

459
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:47,634
or vivacity

460
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:49,636
or...

461
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,141
charm.

462
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:57,894
That's the one thing
your father had plenty of.

463
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:00,605
Charm.

464
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:06,736
After the fiasco at
the Rubicam's Business College,

465
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:09,239
the idea of getting

466
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:11,867
a gentleman caller
for Laura

467
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:15,078
began to play
a more and more important part

468
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,747
in mother's calculations.

469
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:20,000
It became an obsession.

470
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:22,878
late that winter
and in the early spring,

471
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:25,964
realizing
that extra money would be needed

472
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:29,259
to properly feather the nest
and plume the bird,

473
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:31,720
she began conducting

474
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:34,306
a vigorous campaign
on the telephone,

475
00:24:34,347 --> 00:24:36,766
roping in subscribers

476
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:39,853
to one of those magazines
for matrons called

477
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:42,772
The Homemaker's Companion,

478
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:46,109
The type of journal
which features

479
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:50,113
the serialized sublimation
of ladies of letters

480
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:54,117
who think in terms
of delicate cup-like breasts,

481
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,329
slim,
tapering waists,

482
00:24:57,370 --> 00:25:00,582
rich, creamy thighs,

483
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:04,044
eyes like woodsmoke in Autumn,

484
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:07,714
fingers that soothe and caress
like strains of music,

485
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:11,218
bodies as powerful
as Etruscan sculpture.

486
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:12,802
AMANDA:
Ida Scott?

487
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:14,221
Oh!

488
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:15,805
This is Amanda Wingfield.

489
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:18,016
Well, now, Ida,

490
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:21,811
I have just been looking
in my little red book here,

491
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:25,065
and I see where your
subscription to the companion

492
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:26,775
is just about to run out,

493
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:28,985
and it's just when
that wonderful new serial

494
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:30,904
by Bessie Mae Harper
is starting.

495
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:32,656
Hmm.

496
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:34,658
It's the first thing
she's written

497
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:36,076
since honeymoon for three,

498
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:38,328
and that was unusual,
you know.

499
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:41,414
Well, Ida,
this one is even lovelier.

500
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:44,668
It's all about
the horsey set on Long Island,

501
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:47,337
and this debutante
is thrown from a horse

502
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:50,090
while she's taking him
over the jumps

503
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:52,342
in the, uh, uh,

504
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,761
regatta.

505
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:57,097
Well,
her spine is injured.

506
00:25:57,138 --> 00:25:59,391
That's what the horse did.

507
00:25:59,432 --> 00:26:01,893
He stepped on her.

508
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:04,980
And the only surgeon
in the whole wide world

509
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:08,692
who can keep her
from being permanently paralyzed

510
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:11,403
is the man
she's engaged to be married to.

511
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:14,281
And he's tall
and he's blonde and he's--

512
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:15,907
What?

513
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:17,284
Oh, no, honey.

514
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:18,910
Don't let them burn.

515
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,954
You just go
and you take a look in the oven.

516
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:23,832
I'll just sit here
and hold on.

517
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:27,752
You know what that woman did?

518
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:30,046
She hung up on me.

519
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:35,635

521

Well, you look so pretty

There's only one respect

529
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:04,039
in which I would like you
to emulate your father.

What respect is that?

The care he took of his person.

532
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:11,463
Never allowed himself
to be untidy.

00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:23,975
Now, you know,
I have seen a medical chart,

538
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:26,436
and I know what that posture
does to your internal organs.

539
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:28,104
If you sit up,
I'll show you.

540
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:29,731
You see?

541
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:31,316
Your stomach
presses in on your lungs

542
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:33,276
and then your lungs press
in on your heart.

543
00:27:33,276 --> 00:27:35,445
And then your poor little heart
gets discouraged

544
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:37,197
because it doesn't have
any room left

545
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:38,865
to go on beating for you.

546
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:41,159
TOM:
What in Christ's name
am I supposed to do?

547
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:43,411
AMANDA:
Don't you dare
talk to me like that.

548
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:45,038
What is the matter with you?

549
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:46,414
Have you gone
out of your senses?

550
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:48,041
TOM:
Yes, I have.

551
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:49,417
That's true.

552
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:51,044
You've driven me out of them.

553
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:52,921
What is the matter
with you lately,

554
00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:54,839
You big, big idiot?

555
00:27:54,881 --> 00:27:56,257
Look.

556
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:58,843
Mother,
I have got no thing,

557
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:01,930
no single thing in this house
that I can call my own.

558
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:03,306
AMANDA:
Lower your voice.

559
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:06,017
TOM:
Yesterday
you confiscated my books.

560
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:08,311
I certainly did.

561
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:10,814
I took that awful novel
back to the library,

562
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:13,817
That horrible book
by that insane Mr. Lawrence.

563
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:17,320
Well, I can't control
the output of a diseased mind

564
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,072
or the people
that cater to them,

565
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:21,324
but I won't have that filth
in my house.

566
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:23,326
No, no, no.

567
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:24,577
House?
House?

568
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:27,455
Who pays the rent on the house?
Who makes a slave of himself?

569
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:29,457
AMANDA:
Don't you dare talk
to me like that.

570
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:31,918
TOM:
No, that's true, mother.
I mustn't say things.

571
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,420
I've just got
to keep my mouth shut.

572
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:35,130
AMANDA:
Let me tell you something--

573
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:36,589
TOM:
I don't want to hear any more.

574
00:28:36,631 --> 00:28:38,258
AMANDA:
You are going to hear more.

575
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:40,218
TOM:
No, I will not hear more.
I am going out.

576
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,928
AMANDA:
You are going to listen to me!

577
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,346
TOM:
Out, out, out!

578
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:45,098
AMANDA:
You are going to listen to me!

579
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,474
I have had enough
of your impudence.

580
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:48,101
And another thing.

581
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:49,936
I am just
at the end of my patience.

582
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:52,105
TOM:
And what do you think I'm at,
mother?

583
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:54,107
Aren't I supposed
to have any patience

584
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:55,942
to reach the end of?

585
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:57,902
I know it seems unimportant
to you, mother,

586
00:28:57,944 --> 00:28:59,320
What I'm doing,
what I want to do,

587
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:01,197
having little difference
between them.

588
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:04,075
You don't think that.

589
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:06,953
No, I think you were doing
something you're ashamed of,

590
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:08,455
and that's
why you acted like this.

591
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:10,457
Well, I don't believe

592
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:13,293
that you go every night
to the movies.

593
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:15,962
Nobody goes to the movies
night after night.

594
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:18,089
Nobody in their right mind

595
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:20,425
Goes to the movies as often
as you pretend to.

596
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:24,053
And people do not go
to movies at almost midnight,

597
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:26,514
and movies do not let out
at 2:00 a.m.

598
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:29,100
You come in here,

599
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:32,020
stumbling and muttering
to yourself like a maniac,

600
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,605
and you get
three hours sleep

601
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:35,231
and then you go to work.

602
00:29:35,231 --> 00:29:37,525
Now, I can imagine
what you're doing down there,

603
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:40,069
moping and doping,
because you are in no condition.

604
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:42,405
TOM:
No.
That is true, mother.

605
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:43,990
I am in no condition.

606
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:46,284
Tom.

607
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:49,287
How dare you jeopardize your job
and jeopardize our security?

608
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:51,164
Now,
how do you think we would manage

609
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:53,291
if anything happened--

610
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:55,376
TOM:
Listen, mother.

611
00:29:55,418 --> 00:29:58,171
Do you think I'm crazy
about the warehouse?

612
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:01,925
Wo you think I am in love
with the continental shoemakers?

613
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:03,510
Do you think
I want to spend 55 years

614
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:06,262
down in that celotex interior
with fluorescent tubes?

615
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:08,389
Look, mother.

616
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:11,267
I would just rather
somebody pick up a crowbar

617
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:14,229
and batter out my brains
than go back mornings,

618
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:16,356
but I go.

619
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:18,983
Every morning
that you come in yelling

620
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:20,944
that goddamned,
"Rise and shine.

621
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:22,987
Rise and shine."

622
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:25,365
I think to myself
how lucky dead people are.

623
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:27,408
But I get up.

624
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:30,495
I go.

625
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:32,247
For $65 a month,

626
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:34,249
I give up all
that I ever dreamed of doing

627
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:36,000
and being ever,

628
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:37,544
and yet
you say that self,

629
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:39,254
self is all I think of?

630
00:30:39,295 --> 00:30:40,713
Listen to me, mother.

631
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:43,383
If self is what I thought of,
I would be where he is:

632
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:45,051
Gone,

633
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:47,387
as far as the system
of transportation reaches.

634
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:49,097
Don't grab at me, mother.

635
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:50,473
AMANDA:
I'm not grabbing at you.

636
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:52,267
I just want to know
where you're going.

637
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:54,477
I am going
to the movies.

638
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,646
I don't believe that lie!

639
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:59,399
No?

640
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,068
Well, you're right,
mother.

641
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:04,571
I'm going to opium dens.

642
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:07,365
Yes, mother.
Opium dens.

643
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:09,993
Dens of vice
and criminals' hangouts.

644
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:12,662
Mother,
I am a hired assassin.

645
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:15,540
I joined the Hogan gang.

646
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:18,418
I carry a tommy gun
in a violin case

647
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:22,130
and I run a stream of cathouses
in the valley.

648
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:24,507
They call me killer.

649
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:27,510
Killer Wingfield.

650
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:30,388
See, I'm leading a double life,
really.

651
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:33,433
A simple,
honest warehouse worker by day,

652
00:31:33,474 --> 00:31:37,395
but by night a dynamic czar
of the underworld, mother.

653
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:39,689
I go to gambling casinos.

654
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:43,443
I just spin away a fortune
on the roulette table, mother.

655
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:45,486
I wear a patch over one eye

656
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:48,072
and a false mustache

657
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:50,742
and sometimes I put on
green whiskers.

658
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:54,120
On those occasions,
they call me El Diablo.

659
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:57,498
I could tell you many things
to make you sleepless, mother.

660
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,292
My enemies plan

661
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:02,128
to dynamite this place
some night.

662
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:05,673
They are going
to blow us all sky-high!

663
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:07,300
And will I be glad?

664
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:09,260
I'll be very happy.

665
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:11,262
And so will you be.

666
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:15,016
You will go
up, up, up

667
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:16,684
over Blue Mountain
on a broomstick

668
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:20,021
with 17 gentlemen callers!

669
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:21,689
(panting)

670
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:24,233
You ugly, babbling old witch!

671
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:27,028
(rattling)

672
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:30,531
(sobbing)

673
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:34,285
I will never speak to you again
as long as I live

674
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:36,537
unless you apologize to me.

675
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:52,553
(clattering)

676
00:33:02,855 --> 00:33:05,149
Tom?

677
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:10,530
(rattling)

678
00:33:10,571 --> 00:33:12,323
Tom?

679
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:15,326
Tom?

680
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:18,663
What are you doing?

681
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:21,207
Looking
for a door key.

682
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:28,631
Where have you been
all this time?

683
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,844
I have been to the movies.

684
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:35,513
All this time
at the movies?

685
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:38,641
This was a very long program.

686
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:42,520
There was a Garbo picture
and a newsreel

687
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:45,815
and a Mickey Mouse
and a Travelogue

688
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:48,484
and a preview
of coming attractions.

689
00:33:48,484 --> 00:33:50,486
There was an organ solo

690
00:33:50,486 --> 00:33:52,530
and a collection
for the milk fund,

691
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:54,574
simultaneously,

692
00:33:54,615 --> 00:33:56,659
which ended up
in a terrible fight

693
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:58,703
between a fat lady

694
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:00,913
and an usher.

695
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:03,291
Did you have
to stay through everything?

696
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:05,293
TOM:
Of course.

697
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:10,381
Oh, and I forgot.

698
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:13,384
There was a stage show.

699
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:16,429
The headliner
on this stage show

700
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:19,432
was Malvolio the magician.

701
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:22,226
He performed wonderful tricks,
many of them,

702
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:25,480
such as pouring water back
and forth between two pitchers.

703
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:28,566
First it turned into wine,
then it turned into beer,

704
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:30,526
then it turned into whisky.

705
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:33,821
Now, I know that it was whisky
that it finally turned into,

706
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:35,823
because he needed someone

707
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:38,451
to come up out of the audience
to help him,

708
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:40,495
so I came up.

709
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:42,580
Both shows.

710
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:44,582
Kentucky straight bourbon.

711
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:46,626
Very generous fellow.

712
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:48,711
He gave souvenirs.

713
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:55,802
This

714
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:58,846
is his magic scarf.

715
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:06,437
You can have it,
Laura.

716
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:09,232
You wave it over

717
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:11,692
a canary cage.

718
00:35:11,734 --> 00:35:15,696
they turn into
a bowl of goldfish.

719
00:35:15,738 --> 00:35:19,700
And you wave it
over a goldfish bowl

720
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:23,704
and they fly away canaries.

721
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:33,714
But
the wonderfullest trick of all

722
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:36,634
was the coffin trick.

723
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:38,427
We nailed him

724
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:40,555
into a coffin,

725
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:43,933
and he got himself out
without removing one nail.

726
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:47,478
Now, there is a trick
that would come in handy for me.

727
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,981
Get me
out of this 2x4 situation.

728
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:52,692
Shh!
Tom.

729
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:54,443
What are you shushing me for?

730
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:56,988
LAURA:
Shh.
You'll wake up mother.

731
00:35:57,029 --> 00:35:58,614
Goody, goody.

732
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:00,533
Pay her back for all those

733
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:02,702
Rise and shines,
rise and shines.

734
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:07,582
You know, Laura,

735
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:10,334
it don't take much intelligence

736
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:13,546
to get yourself
into a nailed-up coffin.

737
00:36:16,048 --> 00:36:18,718
But who ever got himself
out of one

738
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:22,430
without removing
at least one nail?

739
00:36:37,403 --> 00:36:38,988
Rise and shine.

740
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,324
Rise and shine.

741
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:43,492
TOM:
I will rise,

742
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:45,703
but I won't shine.

743
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:52,668
Laura, go tell your brother
to rise and shine.

744
00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:00,259
Go tell your brother
his coffee's ready.

745
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:05,306
LAURA:
Tom?

746
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:06,724
(knocking)

747
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:08,476
Tom.

748
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:09,936
It's nearly 7:00.

749
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:11,604
Don't make mother nervous.

750
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:13,314
Tom.

751
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:14,732
Speak to mother this morning.

752
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:16,400
Make up with her.

753
00:37:16,442 --> 00:37:17,860
Apologize.

754
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,904
Speak to her.

755
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:21,572
TOM:
She won't to me.

756
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:23,449
It's her
that started not speaking.

757
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:25,576
LAURA:
If you would only say
that you're sorry,

758
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:26,994
she'd start speaking.

759
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:28,621
TOM:
My not speaking,

760
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:29,997
is that such a tragedy?

761
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:31,624
LAURA:
Please, Tom.

762
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:33,000
AMANDA:
Laura,

763
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:34,669
are you going
to do what I asked,

764
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,128
or do I have to get dressed

765
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:38,130
and go out myself?

766
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:39,715
LAURA:
Going, going.

767
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:41,342
Just have to get on my coat.

768
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:42,718
Butter and what else?

769
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,346
AMANDA:
Just butter.
And tell them to charge it.

770
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:47,598
Mother, they make such faces
when I do that.

771
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,101
AMANDA:
Sticks and stones
may break our bones,

772
00:37:50,142 --> 00:37:52,561
but the expression
on Mr. Garfinkel's face

773
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:54,438
won't harm us.

774
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,816
Tell your brother
his coffee's getting cold.

775
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:02,113
Tom,
do what I ask, will you?

776
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:03,781
AMANDA:
Laura!

777
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:05,491
LAURA:
Will you, Tom?

778
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:07,493
AMANDA:
Go now or just don't go at all.

779
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:09,787
Going, going.

780
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:13,457
(panting)

781
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:15,084
Ahh!

782
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:16,669
Laura!

783
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:20,715
AMANDA:
Laura!

784
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:24,051
I'm all right.

785
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:26,721
I slipped,
but I'm all right.

786
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:30,474
AMANDA:
Ooh.

787
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:32,560
If anybody falls down
this landing

788
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,562
and breaks their leg,

789
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:37,565
the landlord ought to be sued
for every cent he's got.

790
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:39,525
(sighing)

791
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:45,948
Well.

792
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:48,034
Who are you?

793
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:57,418
(door slamming)

794
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:10,681
(Tom coughing)

795
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,746
(slurping)

796
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:14,537
(sighing)

797
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:30,219
Mother?

798
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:33,931
I apologize, mother.

799
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:35,641
I'm sorry
for what I said --

800
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:37,560
for everything that I said.

801
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:39,019
I didn't mean it.

802
00:40:41,063 --> 00:40:43,065
My devotion has made me a witch,

803
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:45,901
so I make myself hateful
to my children.

804
00:40:45,901 --> 00:40:48,279
No, you don't.

805
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:51,115
Well, I worry so much,
I can't sleep,

806
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:53,701
so it just makes me nervous.

807
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:56,120
TOM:
I know that, mother.

808
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,664
AMANDA:
Tom.

809
00:40:58,664 --> 00:41:01,041
Now,
you know I have had

810
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:04,170
to fight a solitary battle
all these years.

811
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:06,797
But you are
my right-hand bower.

812
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:09,216
Now,
don't you fail me.

813
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:11,552
Don't you fall down.

814
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:14,597
TOM:
But I try, mother.

815
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:18,559
AMANDA:
Tom, if you try,
you will succeed.

816
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:22,188
You are just full
of natural endowments.

817
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:25,191
Honey,
both of my children are.

818
00:41:25,232 --> 00:41:28,819
They're just
very precious children,

819
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:32,156
and I have so much
to be thankful for.

820
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:35,326
Now, would you just promise me
one thing?

821
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:38,078
TOM:
What, mother?

822
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,831
AMANDA:
Will you promise me

823
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:43,918
that you won't ever become
a drunkard?

824
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:47,880
TOM:
I promise I'll never become
a drunkard, mother.

825
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:52,134
AMANDA:
Come on.

826
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:53,719
Have some Purina.

827
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:55,137
TOM:
No, thanks, mother.

828
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:56,764
Just coffee.

829
00:41:56,805 --> 00:41:59,266
Uh, some Post Toasties?

830
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:01,185
Some, uh, uh,
Wheaties?

831
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:03,103
TOM:
No.

832
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:04,939
No, thanks, mother.

833
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,315
Just coffee's fine.

834
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:08,651
AMANDA:
Honey, you can't work
all day long

835
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:10,027
on an empty stomach.

836
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:11,904
Now,
you've got 10 minutes.

837
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:13,697
Tom, now don't go,
honey.

838
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:16,700
Drinking too-hot liquids
makes cancer of the stomach.

839
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,327
Now, here,
put some milk in it.

840
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:20,162
TOM:
No, thanks.

841
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:22,039
AMANDA:
Well, just to cool it off.

842
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:23,832
TOM:
No, no, thank you, mother.

843
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:25,668
I want it black.

844
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:28,254
AMANDA:
I know, but it's not
good for you like that.

845
00:42:28,295 --> 00:42:30,130
Well, you know,

846
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:33,259
we have to build ourselves up in
these trying times we live in,

847
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:35,636
when all we have
to depend on is each other.

848
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:37,763
And that's why
it's so important to...

849
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:41,350
Tom.

850
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:43,018
Sit down.

851
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:44,812
Come sit down,
honey.

852
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:46,814
Move your coffee.

853
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:51,777
Tom.

854
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:54,071
Now,

855
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:56,323
I sent out your sister

856
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:59,952
because I wanted
to discuss something with you.

857
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:02,204
If you hadn't spoken to me,
I was going to speak to you.

858
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:04,832
TOM:
Well, what is it, mother,
that you want to discuss?

859
00:43:04,873 --> 00:43:06,792
Laura.

860
00:43:06,792 --> 00:43:09,086
Laura?

861
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:11,672
Tom, now,
you know how Laura is.

862
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:14,717
She's so quiet,
but still waters run deep.

863
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,136
She notices things,

864
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:19,972
and I think
she broods about them.

865
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:22,141
Now,

866
00:43:22,182 --> 00:43:24,143
I came here the other day,
and she was crying.

867
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:26,353
What about?

868
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:27,980
You.

869
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:29,398
Me?

870
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,735
Now,
she has this idea

871
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:35,863
that you are not happy here.

872
00:43:35,904 --> 00:43:38,282
What gave her that idea?

873
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:43,245
What gives her any idea?

874
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:44,997
But, honey,

875
00:43:44,997 --> 00:43:48,167
you have been acting
kind of strange lately.

876
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:51,337
Tom, I am not criticizing,
mind you.

877
00:43:51,378 --> 00:43:53,088
Now,
I know that your ambitions

878
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:55,090
do not lie at the warehouse,

879
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:58,010
and like everybody else
in the whole wide world,

880
00:43:58,052 --> 00:44:00,304
you, too,
have had to make sacrifices.

881
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:04,475
Tom,
life is not easy.

882
00:44:06,101 --> 00:44:08,020
It calls for
spartan endurance.

883
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:11,440
Tom.

884
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:13,776
Tom, i--

885
00:44:15,944 --> 00:44:19,281
there are just
so many things in my heart

886
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:22,201
that I cannot describe to you.

887
00:44:22,242 --> 00:44:25,120
Now,
I never told you,

888
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:28,040
but I did love your father.

889
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:29,500
I know that,
mother.

890
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:31,502
But when I see you,

891
00:44:31,543 --> 00:44:35,255
and you're
taking after his ways,

892
00:44:35,255 --> 00:44:37,216
and you're staying out all night

893
00:44:37,257 --> 00:44:39,426
and you had been drinking
the other night

894
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:42,096
when you were
in that terrifying condition--

895
00:44:42,137 --> 00:44:45,099
and now Laura tells me
that you hate this apartment

896
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:46,934
and you go out nights
to get away from it.

897
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:48,310
Now, is that true?

898
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:50,938
No.

899
00:44:50,979 --> 00:44:53,315
Mother,

900
00:44:53,315 --> 00:44:56,068
You say
there's so much in your heart

901
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:58,487
that you can't describe to me.

902
00:44:58,487 --> 00:45:01,073
Well,

903
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:03,867
That's true of me, too,
mother.

904
00:45:03,909 --> 00:45:07,788
there's so much in my heart
that I can't describe to you.

905
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:10,541
So let's just respect
each other's--

906
00:45:10,582 --> 00:45:13,168
Honey.

907
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:15,796
Why are you
so restless?

908
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:18,257
Where do you go to nights?

909
00:45:20,843 --> 00:45:22,928
I go to the movies.

910
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:26,140
Why do you go
to the movies so much?

911
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:29,059
I go to the movies
because I like adventure,

912
00:45:29,101 --> 00:45:32,813
and adventure is something
I don't get much of at work,

913
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:34,982
so I go to the movies.

914
00:45:35,023 --> 00:45:36,567
Honey,

915
00:45:36,608 --> 00:45:39,194
you go
to the movies entirely too much.

916
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:42,156
I like a lot of adventure.

917
00:45:42,197 --> 00:45:45,826
Well, most young men
find adventure in their careers.

918
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:49,121
Most young men are not employed
at warehouses.

919
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:52,875
The world is full of young men
who are employed at warehouses

920
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:54,918
and offices--

921
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:58,172
and do all of them
find adventure in their careers?

922
00:45:58,172 --> 00:46:00,591
Well,
they do or they do without.

923
00:46:00,632 --> 00:46:03,135
Not everybody
in the whole wide world

924
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:04,553
has a craze for adventure.

925
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:07,097
Mother, man is by instinct
a lover,

926
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:09,391
a hunter and a fighter,

927
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:13,270
and none of those instincts
get much play at a warehouse.

928
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:15,981
- Man is by instinct--
- Yes!

929
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:18,066
Don't you quote instinct to me!

930
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:21,361
Now, instinct is something
people have got away from;

931
00:46:21,403 --> 00:46:23,071
It belongs to animals.

932
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:25,032
Christian adults don't want it.

933
00:46:25,073 --> 00:46:28,076
What do Christian adults want,
then, mother?

934
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:30,245
Things of the mind
and of the spirit.

935
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:33,165
Only animals have
to satisfy their instincts.

936
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:36,502
Now, surely your aims
are somewhat higher than theirs.

937
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:38,545
They're monkeys and pigs.

938
00:46:38,587 --> 00:46:41,381
Well,
I reckon they're not.

939
00:46:41,423 --> 00:46:44,593
Tom,
you must be joking.

940
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:46,929
That's not what I wanted
to talk to you about.

941
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:48,430
TOM:
I haven't got time.

942
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:50,516
AMANDA:
You've got five minutes.

943
00:46:50,557 --> 00:46:53,101
You want me to punch in red
at the warehouse?

944
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:55,437
AMANDA:
Tom,
I must talk to you about Laura.

945
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:57,898
All right.
What about Laura?

946
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:00,526
We have got to be making

947
00:47:00,567 --> 00:47:03,487
some plans and provisions
for her.

948
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:06,365
Well, she's older than you.

949
00:47:06,406 --> 00:47:09,660
Tom,
nothing is happening for her.

950
00:47:09,701 --> 00:47:12,204
She just drifts along

951
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:14,414
doing nothing.

952
00:47:14,456 --> 00:47:18,168
Well, I reckon she's the type
that people call home girls.

953
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:20,462
Honey, there's no such type.

954
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:22,965
And if there is,
it's a pity

955
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:26,051
unless the home is hers
with a husband in it.

956
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:27,469
What?

957
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:29,471
AMANDA:
Oh, Tom.

958
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:32,933
Tom, I can see
the handwriting on the wall

959
00:47:32,933 --> 00:47:35,018
As plain as I can see
the nose on my face.

960
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:36,937
More and more,

961
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:40,357
You remind me of your father.

962
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:41,984
Well, well.

963
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:44,152
He was going out
all night long

964
00:47:44,152 --> 00:47:45,946
without any explanation,

965
00:47:45,988 --> 00:47:47,698
and then one day
he was just gone,

966
00:47:47,739 --> 00:47:49,324
goodbye,

967
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:51,034
and leaving me
with the bag to hold.

968
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:53,579
Now,
I saw that letter you got

969
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:55,330
from the merchant Marines.

970
00:47:56,748 --> 00:47:59,710
Well, I saw it.

971
00:48:01,753 --> 00:48:03,755
And I know
what you're dreaming of.

972
00:48:03,797 --> 00:48:06,174
I'm not standing here
blindfolded.

973
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:08,427
All right.

974
00:48:08,427 --> 00:48:10,596
Do it,

975
00:48:10,637 --> 00:48:12,639
but not until you have somebody
to take your place.

976
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:14,224
What do you mean?

977
00:48:14,266 --> 00:48:16,143
AMANDA:
I mean

978
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:18,729
when Laura has somebody
to take care of her,

979
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:22,441
when she's married,
with a home of her own,

980
00:48:22,482 --> 00:48:24,359
independent.

981
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:26,320
Then you can go
wherever you like:

982
00:48:26,361 --> 00:48:28,989
On land, on sea,
wherever the wind blows you.

983
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:30,407
But until that time,

984
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:32,326
you have got
to take care of your sister.

985
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:34,369
Now, Tom,
I don't say me

986
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:36,455
because I'm old
and I don't matter.

987
00:48:36,496 --> 00:48:38,540
But I say your sister,

988
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:41,209
because she's young
and she's dependent.

989
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:44,087
But, mother,
what can I do about it?

990
00:48:44,129 --> 00:48:46,423
You can overcome selfishness.

991
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:48,508
Tom!

992
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:50,761
Self, self, self!

993
00:48:50,802 --> 00:48:54,306
- That's all you ever think about.
- Tom!

994
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:56,141
Tom, now, wait.

995
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:57,768
No, Tom.

996
00:48:57,809 --> 00:48:59,603
Wait, wait.

997
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:01,730
I didn't say what I was
in mind to ask you.

998
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:03,565
TOM:
Mother, I'm too late to--

999
00:49:03,565 --> 00:49:05,359
AMANDA:
Put on your muffler.

1000
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,194
Put on your wool muffler.

1001
00:49:07,235 --> 00:49:09,112
Tom, Tom, Tom.

1002
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:10,739
Now, down at the warehouse,

1003
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:12,616
aren't there
some nice young men?

1004
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:14,451
TOM:
No!

1005
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:16,286
AMANDA:
Oh, there must be some.

1006
00:49:16,328 --> 00:49:18,622
Just, please,
find one who's clean-living,

1007
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:20,499
Who doesn't drink,

1008
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:22,334
and ask him out for your sister.

1009
00:49:22,376 --> 00:49:23,752
TOM:
What?

1010
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:25,337
AMANDA:
For your sister.

1011
00:49:25,379 --> 00:49:26,755
For me.

1012
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:28,382
To get acquainted.

1013
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:29,758
TOM:
Oh, my gosh.

1014
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,343
AMANDA:
Oh, will you?

1015
00:49:31,343 --> 00:49:32,719
Will you?

1016
00:49:32,761 --> 00:49:34,346
Will you?

1017
00:49:34,388 --> 00:49:35,722
Will you, dear?

1018
00:49:35,764 --> 00:49:38,141
TOM:
Yes.

1019
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,273
Voice of AMANDA:
Ella?

1020
00:49:45,315 --> 00:49:47,526
Ella Cartwright?

1021
00:49:47,567 --> 00:49:49,736
Well,
this is Amanda Wingfield!

1022
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:52,155
Well, now,
first, Ella,

1023
00:49:52,197 --> 00:49:54,366
how is your kidney problem?

1024
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:56,576
It's come back?

1025
00:49:56,618 --> 00:49:58,829
Oh, Ella.

1026
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:01,206
You are
a Christian martyr.

1027
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:03,458
No, no.

1028
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:05,669
That is what you are.

1029
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:07,879
You are
a Christian martyr.

1030
00:50:07,921 --> 00:50:10,298
Well, now, Ella,

1031
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:13,677
I have been looking through
my little red book here,

1032
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:16,096
and I see
where your subscription

1033
00:50:16,138 --> 00:50:18,348
to the companion has run out.

1034
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:21,601
And it's just
when that wonderful serial

1035
00:50:21,601 --> 00:50:24,396
by Bessie Mae Harper
is starting.

1036
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:27,149
It's the one that's all about

1037
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:29,818
the horsey set
on Long Island and--

1038
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:32,487
you have?

1039
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:34,573
You've already read it?

1040
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:39,494
Well,
how do you think it turns out?

1041
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:42,414
Well, no.

1042
00:50:42,456 --> 00:50:45,709
Bessie Mae Harper
never lets you down.

1043
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:48,587
Well, Ella, you have to--

1044
00:50:48,628 --> 00:50:51,214
Ella,
you have to have complications.

1045
00:50:51,256 --> 00:50:54,259
You can't have a story
without complications.

1046
00:50:54,259 --> 00:50:56,720
But Bessie Mae Harper
always leaves you

1047
00:50:56,762 --> 00:50:58,847
with such an uplift.

1048
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:01,183
Ella,
what's the matter?

1049
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:03,477
Well, you sound so mad.

1050
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:07,355
(sighing)

1051
00:51:07,355 --> 00:51:11,193
You mean because
it's only 7:00 in the morning?

1052
00:51:13,195 --> 00:51:15,447
Oh, Ella.

1053
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:16,865
I'm sorry.

1054
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:20,494
I forgot you never got up
before 9:00.

1055
00:51:20,535 --> 00:51:23,747
Well, I forgot anybody
in the whole wide world

1056
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:26,666
was allowed to sleep
as late as that.

1057
00:51:26,708 --> 00:51:28,960
Well, I can't say anything
but I'm sorry,

1058
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,837
Can I?

1059
00:51:32,881 --> 00:51:35,467
You will?

1060
00:51:35,509 --> 00:51:39,387
You will take that subscription
from me anyhow?

1061
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:43,850
Well, bless you.

1062
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:46,186
Bless you.

1063
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:48,188
Bless you,
Ella.

1064
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:51,191
Bless you,
Bless you.

1065
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:57,739
TOM:
Across the alley from us
was the Paradise Dance Hall.

1066
00:51:57,781 --> 00:52:00,242
On evenings in spring

1067
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:02,577
the windows and doors
would be open

1068
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:05,747
and the music
would come outside.

1069
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:09,501
Sometimes they would
turn out all the lights

1070
00:52:09,501 --> 00:52:13,421
except for a large glass sphere
which hung from the ceiling.

1071
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:15,966
It would turn slowly about

1072
00:52:16,007 --> 00:52:19,928
and filter the dust
with delicate rainbow colors.

1073
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:23,932
Then the orchestra would
strike up a waltz or a tango,

1074
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:27,769
something that had
a slow and sensuous rhythm.

1075
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:29,896
Couples would come outside

1076
00:52:29,938 --> 00:52:32,774
to the relative privacy
of the alley.

1077
00:52:32,774 --> 00:52:34,901
You could see them kissing

1078
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:38,238
behind ash pits
and telephone poles.

1079
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:41,825
This was compensation
for lives that passed like mine,

1080
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:43,910
without any change or adventure.

1081
00:52:43,952 --> 00:52:47,414
Adventure and change
were imminent in this year.

1082
00:52:47,455 --> 00:52:49,875
They were waiting
behind the corner

1083
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:52,294
for all these kids.

1084
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:55,255
Suspended in the mist
over Berchtesgaden,

1085
00:52:55,297 --> 00:52:58,550
caught in the folds
of chamberlain's umbrella.

1086
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:01,011
In Spain there was civil war;

1087
00:53:01,052 --> 00:53:04,764
here there was
only hot swing music and liquor,

1088
00:53:04,764 --> 00:53:07,809
dance halls,
bars and movies and sex,

1089
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:11,688
which hung in the gloom
like a chandelier

1090
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:13,899
and fluttered the world

1091
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:16,902
with brief,
deceptive rainbows.

1092
00:53:16,943 --> 00:53:20,864
all the world was waiting
for bombardment.

1093
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:22,866
AMANDA:
Tom.

1094
00:53:22,908 --> 00:53:24,910
Tom!

1095
00:53:24,951 --> 00:53:27,037
Where are you?

1096
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:29,623
TOM:
I came out to smoke, mother.

1097
00:53:29,664 --> 00:53:32,417
AMANDA:
Well, you smoke too much.

1098
00:53:36,671 --> 00:53:39,799
A pack a day
at 15¢ a pack?

1099
00:53:39,799 --> 00:53:43,470
Now, how much would that be
in a month?

1100
00:53:43,511 --> 00:53:46,640
So, 15 times 30.

1101
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:49,643
Well,
it wouldn't be too much,

1102
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:52,771
but it would be enough
to go towards

1103
00:53:52,812 --> 00:53:55,941
a night school course
in accounting

1104
00:53:55,982 --> 00:53:58,360
at the Washington U.

1105
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:00,570
Now,
wouldn't that be lovely?

1106
00:54:00,612 --> 00:54:02,906
TOM:
I'd rather smoke.

1107
00:54:02,948 --> 00:54:05,492
AMANDA:
I know.

1108
00:54:05,533 --> 00:54:07,911
That's the tragedy of you.

1109
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:10,455
(sighing)

1110
00:54:10,455 --> 00:54:12,791
This fire escape landing

1111
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:16,378
is a poor excuse
for that porch we used to have.

1112
00:54:22,175 --> 00:54:24,302
What are you looking at?

1113
00:54:24,344 --> 00:54:26,012
The moon.

1114
00:54:26,054 --> 00:54:29,349
Is there a moon this evening?

1115
00:54:29,391 --> 00:54:31,518
Oh.

1116
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:33,895
So there is,

1117
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:37,399
just a little silver slipper
of a moon.

1118
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:49,953
Well,
did you make a wish on it?

1119
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:51,538
TOM:
Mm-hmm.

1120
00:54:51,579 --> 00:54:52,956
AMANDA:
What did you wish for?

1121
00:54:52,998 --> 00:54:54,541
TOM:
That's a secret.

1122
00:54:54,582 --> 00:54:56,084
AMANDA:
All right.

1123
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:58,128
I won't tell you
what I wished for.

1124
00:54:58,169 --> 00:55:00,380
I can be just
as mysterious as you can.

1125
00:55:00,422 --> 00:55:02,882
TOM:
I'll bet I can guess
what you wished for.

1126
00:55:02,882 --> 00:55:05,593
Why, now,
is my head transparent?

1127
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:08,388
TOM:
You're not a sphinx.

1128
00:55:08,388 --> 00:55:10,974
AMANDA:
No, I don't keep secrets.

1129
00:55:11,016 --> 00:55:13,727
I'll tell you what I wished for.

1130
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:16,438
I wished for success
and happiness

1131
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:17,981
for my precious children.

1132
00:55:18,023 --> 00:55:20,567
That's what I wish for
every time there's a moon,

1133
00:55:20,608 --> 00:55:22,777
and when there isn't a moon,
I wish for it too.

1134
00:55:22,777 --> 00:55:25,697
TOM:
I thought perhaps you wished for
a gentleman caller.

1135
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:27,490
Now, what makes you say that?

1136
00:55:27,532 --> 00:55:29,868
TOM:
Oh, you don't remember asking me
to fetch one?

1137
00:55:29,909 --> 00:55:32,912
AMANDA:
I remember suggesting
it would be nice for your sister

1138
00:55:32,954 --> 00:55:34,914
if you brought home
some nice young man.

1139
00:55:34,956 --> 00:55:36,875
I made that suggestion
more than once.

1140
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:39,544
Yes, you made it repeatedly.

1141
00:55:39,544 --> 00:55:41,713
Well?

1142
00:55:46,551 --> 00:55:48,636
We are going to have one.

1143
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:50,055
AMANDA:
What?

1144
00:55:50,096 --> 00:55:51,931
A gentleman caller.

1145
00:55:51,931 --> 00:55:53,933
Do you mean
that you have asked

1146
00:55:53,933 --> 00:55:56,061
some nice young man
to come over?

1147
00:55:56,102 --> 00:55:58,063
Yep.

1148
00:55:58,104 --> 00:55:59,856
I have asked him to dinner.

1149
00:55:59,898 --> 00:56:01,858
- You really did?
- I did.

1150
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:03,485
AMANDA:
Did he accept?

1151
00:56:03,485 --> 00:56:04,861
He did.

1152
00:56:04,903 --> 00:56:07,697
- He did?
- He did.

1153
00:56:07,739 --> 00:56:10,533
Oh, isn't that lovely?

1154
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:13,536
Yes.
I thought you would be pleased.

1155
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:14,913
Well, now,
this is definite?

1156
00:56:14,954 --> 00:56:16,664
Pretty definite.

1157
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:19,250
- Well, how soon?
- Pretty soon.

1158
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:20,835
AMANDA:
Well, how soon?

1159
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:22,587
Quite soon.

1160
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:24,089
How soon?

1161
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:25,965
Very soon.

1162
00:56:25,965 --> 00:56:29,094
Tom, every time I want to know
something, you go on like that.

1163
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:30,678
TOM:
What do you want to know?

1164
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,639
Well, guess.
Just go on and guess.

1165
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:35,141
You want to know

1166
00:56:35,141 --> 00:56:38,812
when the gentleman caller's
coming to dinner?

1167
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:41,231
He's coming tomorrow.

1168
00:56:41,272 --> 00:56:43,817
- Tomorrow?
- Yes.

1169
00:56:43,858 --> 00:56:45,902
I can't do anything by tomorrow.

1170
00:56:45,944 --> 00:56:47,779
I can't do anything
about tomorrow.

1171
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:49,197
TOM:
Why not?

1172
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:50,907
That doesn't give me any time.

1173
00:56:50,949 --> 00:56:52,534
TOM:
Time for what?

1174
00:56:52,575 --> 00:56:53,910
Preparations.

1175
00:56:53,952 --> 00:56:56,246
You should have called me
the minute you invited him,

1176
00:56:56,246 --> 00:56:57,872
the minute he accepted.

1177
00:56:57,914 --> 00:56:59,958
Mother, you don't have
to make any fuss.

1178
00:56:59,958 --> 00:57:02,001
Of course I have to make a fuss.

1179
00:57:02,043 --> 00:57:04,963
I can't have a man
coming into a place

1180
00:57:05,004 --> 00:57:07,006
that's all sloppy.

1181
00:57:07,006 --> 00:57:09,676
It has to be
thrown together properly.

1182
00:57:09,717 --> 00:57:12,095
I have to do some fast thinking
by tomorrow night.

1183
00:57:12,137 --> 00:57:13,847
TOM:
Mother, I don't see

1184
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:15,849
why you have to think at all.

1185
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:18,893
That's because
you just don't know.

1186
00:57:18,935 --> 00:57:20,520
You just don't know,
that's all.

1187
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,105
I cannot have
a gentleman caller coming

1188
00:57:22,147 --> 00:57:23,731
into a pigsty.

1189
00:57:23,731 --> 00:57:25,108
Oh!

1190
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:26,734
Let me see.

1191
00:57:26,734 --> 00:57:28,111
Oh!

1192
00:57:28,153 --> 00:57:30,196
I wonder
how that old lace tablecloth

1193
00:57:30,238 --> 00:57:32,198
is holding up
after all these years.

1194
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:33,950
Oh!

1195
00:57:33,992 --> 00:57:35,702
Oh!

1196
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:37,245
Tom,
we can't wear anything.

1197
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:38,997
We haven't got it.

1198
00:57:38,997 --> 00:57:40,748
We haven't got
anything to wear.

1199
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:44,043
Mother, this is no boy
to make a fuss over.

1200
00:57:44,085 --> 00:57:47,088
I don't know how
you can say that when this is

1201
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:50,717
the first gentleman caller
your little sister has ever had.

1202
00:57:50,758 --> 00:57:52,177
Now, come on inside.

1203
00:57:52,218 --> 00:57:54,053
TOM:
What for?

1204
00:57:54,095 --> 00:57:56,848
AMANDA:
Because I want
to ask you a few things.

1205
00:57:56,890 --> 00:57:58,933
Mother,
if you are going to make a fuss,

1206
00:57:58,975 --> 00:58:00,810
I will call the whole thing off.

1207
00:58:00,852 --> 00:58:02,770
Mother,
I will tell him not to come.

1208
00:58:02,812 --> 00:58:04,647
AMANDA:
You can't do that.

1209
00:58:04,689 --> 00:58:06,316
People hate broken engagements.

1210
00:58:06,357 --> 00:58:08,276
Then they've got no place to go.

1211
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:10,153
Now,
come on inside.

1212
00:58:11,779 --> 00:58:13,239
Now, sit down.

1213
00:58:13,281 --> 00:58:16,075
Any particular place
that you'd like me to sit?

1214
00:58:16,117 --> 00:58:18,578
Sit anywhere.

1215
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:25,043
Now, look at that.

1216
00:58:25,043 --> 00:58:28,588
Isn't that the saddest thing
you've ever seen in your life?

1217
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:30,590
What am I going to do with that?

1218
00:58:30,632 --> 00:58:32,592
Oh, I know.

1219
00:58:32,634 --> 00:58:34,677
I can get
a bright piece of cretonne.

1220
00:58:34,719 --> 00:58:36,679
Now, that won't cost too much.

1221
00:58:36,721 --> 00:58:39,140
And I made the down payment
on a floor lamp,

1222
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:41,142
So I'll have that sent out.

1223
00:58:41,184 --> 00:58:43,811
And I can put
a bright color on that chair.

1224
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:46,064
Oh, I wish I had time
to paper the walls.

1225
00:58:46,105 --> 00:58:47,857
Now, what is his name?

1226
00:58:47,899 --> 00:58:50,109
TOM:
His name is O'Connor.

1227
00:58:50,151 --> 00:58:52,195
O'Connor?

1228
00:58:52,237 --> 00:58:54,364
He's Irish?

1229
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:56,699
Tomorrow's Friday.

1230
00:58:56,699 --> 00:58:58,826
That means fish.

1231
00:58:58,868 --> 00:59:02,413
I'll make that salmon loaf
with the mayonnaise dressing.

1232
00:59:02,413 --> 00:59:03,998
Now,
where did you meet him?

1233
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:06,084
TOM:
At the warehouse.
Where else would I meet him?

1234
00:59:06,125 --> 00:59:07,752
I don't know.

1235
00:59:07,752 --> 00:59:09,212
Does he drink?

1236
00:59:09,254 --> 00:59:10,964
Why do you ask me that?

1237
00:59:11,005 --> 00:59:12,382
Because your father did.

1238
00:59:12,423 --> 00:59:13,967
TOM:
Don't get started on that.

1239
00:59:13,967 --> 00:59:15,343
AMANDA:
He drinks, then.

1240
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:16,928
TOM:
Not that I know of.

1241
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:18,346
AMANDA:
You have got to find out.

1242
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:20,014
The one thing I do not want
for my daughter

1243
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:21,641
Is a man who drinks.

1244
00:59:21,641 --> 00:59:24,644
You're not being
the tiniest bit premature?

1245
00:59:24,686 --> 00:59:28,189
Mr. O'Connor has not yet arrived
on the scene.

1246
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:31,859
He will tomorrow night
to meet your sister.

1247
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:35,154
And what do I know
about his character?

1248
00:59:35,196 --> 00:59:36,739
What are you doing?

1249
00:59:36,781 --> 00:59:38,157
AMANDA:
I hate that cowlick.

1250
00:59:38,199 --> 00:59:40,326
I wish it would stay back by--
oh, Tom, will you--

1251
00:59:40,368 --> 00:59:42,328
mother,

1252
00:59:42,370 --> 00:59:45,957
lots of boys meet girls

1253
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:48,710
who they don't marry.

1254
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:51,129
You know,
you have always had me puzzled

1255
00:59:51,129 --> 00:59:53,673
because you cannot stay
on one subject.

1256
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:55,133
What I want to know is

1257
00:59:55,174 --> 00:59:57,260
what is his position
down at the warehouse?

1258
00:59:57,302 --> 01:00:00,888
His position
is that of a shipping clerk.

1259
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:02,807
Shipping clerk?

1260
01:00:02,849 --> 01:00:05,226
Well, that sounds
pretty important to me.

1261
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:07,854
Well, that's what you'd be
if you had any get-up.

1262
01:00:07,854 --> 01:00:09,939
Now, how much does he earn?

1263
01:00:09,981 --> 01:00:13,943
TOM:
I would judge his salary to be
approximately $85 per month.

1264
01:00:13,985 --> 01:00:15,361
So, $85 a month?

1265
01:00:15,403 --> 01:00:18,114
Well,
that's not princely.

1266
01:00:18,114 --> 01:00:19,699
It's 20 more than I make.

1267
01:00:19,741 --> 01:00:21,117
Oh-hoo.

1268
01:00:21,117 --> 01:00:22,827
How well I know that.

1269
01:00:22,869 --> 01:00:24,412
Eighty-five dollars a month.

1270
01:00:27,248 --> 01:00:30,168
A family man can't get by
on $85 a month.

1271
01:00:30,209 --> 01:00:34,172
Um, Mr. O'Connor
is not a family man.

1272
01:00:34,213 --> 01:00:37,091
Well, he might be one day,
mightn't he?

1273
01:00:37,133 --> 01:00:38,468
I see.

1274
01:00:38,509 --> 01:00:40,094
Plans and provisions.

1275
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:42,013
You know, Tom,

1276
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:44,390
you are
the only young man I know

1277
01:00:44,432 --> 01:00:46,184
that ignores the fact

1278
01:00:46,225 --> 01:00:48,061
that the future
becomes the present,

1279
01:00:48,102 --> 01:00:49,771
the present the past,

1280
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:51,898
and the past turns into
everlasting regret

1281
01:00:51,939 --> 01:00:54,067
unless you plan for it.

1282
01:00:54,108 --> 01:00:56,903
I'll think that over
and see what I can make of it.

1283
01:00:56,944 --> 01:00:59,322
Don't be supercilious
with your mother.

1284
01:00:59,322 --> 01:01:01,824
Now, tell me some more
about Mr. O'Connor.

1285
01:01:01,866 --> 01:01:03,493
Mr. O'Connor.

1286
01:01:03,534 --> 01:01:06,371
We've got to have
another name besides mister.

1287
01:01:06,412 --> 01:01:08,206
James D. O'Connor.

1288
01:01:08,247 --> 01:01:10,291
The "D" is for Delaney.

1289
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:11,876
Delaney?

1290
01:01:11,918 --> 01:01:13,753
He's Irish on both sides
and he doesn't drink?

1291
01:01:13,795 --> 01:01:15,546
Shall I call him up and ask him?

1292
01:01:15,588 --> 01:01:17,465
Tom!

1293
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:19,384
TOM:
No, I'll call him and ask him.

1294
01:01:19,425 --> 01:01:21,344
AMANDA:
You can't do that.

1295
01:01:21,386 --> 01:01:24,055
You've got to be discreet
about that subject.

1296
01:01:24,097 --> 01:01:26,265
Why, when I was a girl
in Blue Mountain,

1297
01:01:26,265 --> 01:01:29,102
and it was suspected
that a young man was drinking

1298
01:01:29,102 --> 01:01:30,978
and some girl--

1299
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:33,272
some girl was receiving
his attentions,

1300
01:01:33,314 --> 01:01:35,983
then if some girl
was receiving his attentions,

1301
01:01:36,025 --> 01:01:37,985
she would go

1302
01:01:37,985 --> 01:01:41,364
to the minister of his church
and ask about his character.

1303
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:43,116
Or her father.

1304
01:01:43,157 --> 01:01:44,992
If her father were living,

1305
01:01:45,034 --> 01:01:46,536
it was
his duty to go

1306
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:50,289
to the minister of his church
and ask about his character.

1307
01:01:50,331 --> 01:01:53,126
Now, that is how young girls
from Blue Mountain

1308
01:01:53,167 --> 01:01:55,503
were kept
from making tragic mistakes.

1309
01:01:55,545 --> 01:01:57,130
Then, how did it happen

1310
01:01:57,130 --> 01:01:59,173
that you made
such a tragic mistake,

1311
01:01:59,215 --> 01:02:01,384
Mother?

1312
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:03,970
AMANDA:
That face fooled everybody.

1313
01:02:04,011 --> 01:02:06,222
All he had
to do was grin

1314
01:02:06,264 --> 01:02:08,474
and the world was bewitched.

1315
01:02:08,474 --> 01:02:11,018
I think
there's nothing more tragic

1316
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:13,521
than a young girl
just putting herself

1317
01:02:13,521 --> 01:02:16,190
at the mercy
of a handsome appearance.

1318
01:02:16,232 --> 01:02:19,861
And I hope that Mr. O'Connor
is not too good-looking.

1319
01:02:19,861 --> 01:02:21,529
As a matter of fact,
he isn't.

1320
01:02:21,529 --> 01:02:23,865
He has rather a large nose,

1321
01:02:23,906 --> 01:02:27,368
which he compensates for
by not having much of a chin.

1322
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:29,287
He's not right-down homely,
is he?

1323
01:02:29,328 --> 01:02:31,122
Not right-down homely.

1324
01:02:31,122 --> 01:02:33,541
Medium homely,
I'd say.

1325
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:35,918
Well,
if a girl had any sense,

1326
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:39,005
she would look
for character in a man anyway.

1327
01:02:39,005 --> 01:02:41,007
That's what I've always said.

1328
01:02:41,048 --> 01:02:42,842
You always said that.

1329
01:02:42,842 --> 01:02:44,927
You have always
said that?

1330
01:02:44,969 --> 01:02:46,929
Yes.

1331
01:02:46,971 --> 01:02:48,848
Well, now,
how could you always say that

1332
01:02:48,890 --> 01:02:50,516
If you never even
thought about it?

1333
01:02:50,558 --> 01:02:53,436
Mother,
don't be so suspicious.

1334
01:02:53,478 --> 01:02:55,021
I am.

1335
01:02:55,021 --> 01:02:56,606
I am suspicious of every word

1336
01:02:56,647 --> 01:02:59,525
that comes out of your mouth
when you're talking to me.

1337
01:02:59,567 --> 01:03:02,862
Now, tell me some more
about this young man.

1338
01:03:02,904 --> 01:03:05,448
Now, is he up-and-coming?

1339
01:03:05,490 --> 01:03:07,074
TOM:
Yes.

1340
01:03:07,116 --> 01:03:09,869
I think he really goes in
for self-improvement.

1341
01:03:09,911 --> 01:03:11,579
AMANDA:
What makes you say that?

1342
01:03:11,621 --> 01:03:13,998
TOM:
He goes to night school.

1343
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:16,209
AMANDA:
Night school?

1344
01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:18,544
What does he do at night school?

1345
01:03:18,586 --> 01:03:22,381
TOM:
He studies radio engineering
and public speaking.

1346
01:03:22,423 --> 01:03:24,509
AMANDA:
Public speaking?

1347
01:03:24,550 --> 01:03:26,135
Now,

1348
01:03:26,177 --> 01:03:29,055
that shows he intends
to be an executive.

1349
01:03:29,096 --> 01:03:30,556
And radio engineering.

1350
01:03:30,598 --> 01:03:32,183
Well,
that's coming, hmm?

1351
01:03:32,225 --> 01:03:34,018
TOM:
I'm afraid it's here.

1352
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:37,396
AMANDA:
Those are
very illuminating facts,

1353
01:03:37,438 --> 01:03:39,440
facts that
any mother should know

1354
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:42,944
about any young man who's coming
to call on her daughter,

1355
01:03:42,944 --> 01:03:44,987
serious or not.

1356
01:03:44,987 --> 01:03:46,989
TOM:
One little warning,
mother.

1357
01:03:46,989 --> 01:03:48,366
I didn't tell him about Laura.

1358
01:03:48,407 --> 01:03:51,327
I didn't let on that
we had dark ulterior motives.

1359
01:03:51,327 --> 01:03:52,995
I simply said,

1360
01:03:52,995 --> 01:03:54,956
"Why don't you come over
for dinner?"

1361
01:03:54,997 --> 01:03:56,374
He said, "okay."

1362
01:03:56,374 --> 01:03:58,125
And that was
the whole conversation.

1363
01:03:58,167 --> 01:03:59,544
AMANDA:
I bet it was too.

1364
01:03:59,544 --> 01:04:01,921
Sometimes you can be eloquent
as an oyster.

1365
01:04:01,963 --> 01:04:04,715
However, when he sees how sweet
and how pretty that child is,

1366
01:04:04,757 --> 01:04:06,259
He's going to be so glad

1367
01:04:06,342 --> 01:04:08,386
he was invited over here
to have some dinner.

1368
01:04:08,427 --> 01:04:10,012
TOM:
Mother,

1369
01:04:10,054 --> 01:04:12,139
You won't expect too much
of Laura, will you?

1370
01:04:12,181 --> 01:04:13,683
AMANDA:
I don't know what you mean.

1371
01:04:13,724 --> 01:04:16,143
TOM:
Mother, Laura seems all
those things to us

1372
01:04:16,185 --> 01:04:17,687
because she's ours
and we love her.

1373
01:04:17,728 --> 01:04:20,022
We don't even notice
she's crippled anymore.

1374
01:04:20,064 --> 01:04:21,524
AMANDA:
Hush.

1375
01:04:21,566 --> 01:04:23,192
Don't use that word.

1376
01:04:23,234 --> 01:04:24,652
TOM:
Laura is crippled.

1377
01:04:24,694 --> 01:04:26,279
She is.

1378
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:27,697
Face facts.

1379
01:04:27,697 --> 01:04:29,282
And that's not all.

1380
01:04:29,323 --> 01:04:31,200
AMANDA:
What do you mean,
that's not all?

1381
01:04:31,242 --> 01:04:33,369
TOM:
Laura is very different
from other girls.

1382
01:04:33,369 --> 01:04:36,372
AMANDA:
I know that, and I think the
difference is all in her favor.

1383
01:04:36,414 --> 01:04:39,417
TOM:
No, not quite all.

1384
01:04:39,417 --> 01:04:42,044
Mother,
in the eyes of others,

1385
01:04:42,086 --> 01:04:43,629
strangers,

1386
01:04:43,671 --> 01:04:45,631
she is terribly shy.

1387
01:04:45,673 --> 01:04:47,300
She lives in
a world of her own,

1388
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:50,052
and that can make her
seem peculiar to other people.

1389
01:04:50,094 --> 01:04:52,096
AMANDA:
Don't use that word "peculiar."

1390
01:04:52,138 --> 01:04:53,306
TOM:
She is peculiar.

1391
01:04:53,306 --> 01:04:56,559
AMANDA:
Well, I don't know
in what way she's peculiar.

1392
01:04:56,601 --> 01:05:00,396
TOM:
Mother, she lives in a world
of little glass ornaments.

1393
01:05:00,438 --> 01:05:03,482
She sits and plays
those old phonograph records.

1394
01:05:05,526 --> 01:05:08,154
That's about all.

1395
01:05:08,195 --> 01:05:09,572
AMANDA:
Where are you going?

1396
01:05:09,572 --> 01:05:12,199
TOM:
I'm going to the movies.

1397
01:05:16,621 --> 01:05:18,789
AMANDA:
Laura?

1398
01:05:21,375 --> 01:05:24,045
Laura?

1399
01:05:24,086 --> 01:05:25,588
LAURA:
Yes, mother?

1400
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:28,799
AMANDA:
Honey, leave that ironing
and come on out here.

1401
01:05:33,054 --> 01:05:35,306
Come on.

1402
01:05:41,354 --> 01:05:44,690
Honey, come on out
and make a wish on the moon.

1403
01:05:46,567 --> 01:05:48,110
LAURA:
The moon?

1404
01:05:48,152 --> 01:05:49,528
AMANDA:
See?

1405
01:05:49,570 --> 01:05:51,781
Just a little silver slipper
of the moon.

1406
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:54,033
Now, honey, here.

1407
01:05:54,075 --> 01:05:57,453
Look over your left shoulder
and make a wish.

1408
01:05:57,453 --> 01:05:59,538
Now, honey.

1409
01:05:59,580 --> 01:06:01,540
Wish.

1410
01:06:01,582 --> 01:06:03,793
LAURA:
What shall I wish for, mother?

1411
01:06:06,253 --> 01:06:09,423
AMANDA:
Happiness.

1412
01:06:09,465 --> 01:06:12,802
Just a little bit
of good fortune.

1413
01:06:18,474 --> 01:06:22,436
The following evening
I brought Jim home to dinner.

1414
01:06:22,478 --> 01:06:25,564
I had known Jim slightly
in high school.

1415
01:06:25,606 --> 01:06:28,693
Jim was the only person
at the warehouse

1416
01:06:28,734 --> 01:06:31,445
with whom I was
on friendly terms.

1417
01:06:31,487 --> 01:06:33,656
I was valuable to him

1418
01:06:33,698 --> 01:06:37,118
as someone who could remember
his former glory,

1419
01:06:37,159 --> 01:06:39,620
who had seen him win
basketball games

1420
01:06:39,662 --> 01:06:41,831
and the silver cup in debating.

1421
01:06:41,872 --> 01:06:45,543
He knew of my secret practice
of retiring to a cabinet

1422
01:06:45,543 --> 01:06:49,422
to work on poems when business
was slack at the warehouse.

1423
01:06:49,463 --> 01:06:51,757
He called me Shakespeare.

1424
01:06:51,799 --> 01:06:54,677
And while the other boys
in the warehouse

1425
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:57,722
regarded me
with a suspicious hostility,

1426
01:06:57,763 --> 01:07:00,766
Jim took
a humorous attitude towards me.

1427
01:07:00,766 --> 01:07:04,103
Gradually his attitude affected
the others,

1428
01:07:04,103 --> 01:07:06,397
and their hostility wore off,

1429
01:07:06,439 --> 01:07:08,816
and they also began
to smile at me,

1430
01:07:08,858 --> 01:07:11,819
as people smile
at an oddly fashioned dog

1431
01:07:11,819 --> 01:07:15,573
who trots across their path
at some distance.

1432
01:07:15,614 --> 01:07:19,535
I knew that Jim and Laura had
known each other in high school,

1433
01:07:19,535 --> 01:07:23,456
and I had heard Laura speak
admiringly of Jim's voice.

1434
01:07:23,497 --> 01:07:26,917
I didn't know whether
Jim remembered her or not,

1435
01:07:26,917 --> 01:07:30,463
for in high school Laura
had been as unobtrusive

1436
01:07:30,504 --> 01:07:32,798
as Jim had been astonishing.

1437
01:07:32,798 --> 01:07:35,259
if he did remember her
at all,

1438
01:07:35,301 --> 01:07:37,595
it was not as my sister,

1439
01:07:37,636 --> 01:07:41,474
for when I asked him to dinner
he grinned and said,

1440
01:07:41,474 --> 01:07:44,477
"You know, Shakespeare,

1441
01:07:44,477 --> 01:07:48,397
I never thought of you
as having folks."

1442
01:07:48,439 --> 01:07:52,401
He was about to discover
that I did.

1443
01:07:52,443 --> 01:07:54,487
(thunder rumbling)

1444
01:07:54,528 --> 01:07:56,489
AMANDA:
Now, hold still.

1445
01:07:58,699 --> 01:08:00,910
Honey,
why are you trembling so?

1446
01:08:00,951 --> 01:08:03,621
LAURA:
Mother,
you have made me so nervous.

1447
01:08:03,621 --> 01:08:06,290
AMANDA:
How have I made you nervous?

1448
01:08:06,290 --> 01:08:07,666
LAURA:
By all this fuss.

1449
01:08:07,708 --> 01:08:09,335
You make it seem so important.

1450
01:08:09,376 --> 01:08:11,504
AMANDA:
Laura,
I don't understand you.

1451
01:08:11,545 --> 01:08:13,422
Every time I try to do anything

1452
01:08:13,464 --> 01:08:15,633
that is
the least bit different for you,

1453
01:08:15,674 --> 01:08:17,760
you just seem
to set yourself against it.

1454
01:08:17,802 --> 01:08:19,637
Now, turn around.

1455
01:08:19,678 --> 01:08:21,555
Look at yourself in the mirror.

1456
01:08:21,597 --> 01:08:23,182
Come on, look.

1457
01:08:23,182 --> 01:08:24,558
Oh, no.

1458
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:26,185
Wait, wait.

1459
01:08:26,185 --> 01:08:27,520
I forgot something.

1460
01:08:27,561 --> 01:08:28,938
LAURA:
What is it?

1461
01:08:28,979 --> 01:08:31,232
AMANDA:
A couple of little improvements.

1462
01:08:31,232 --> 01:08:33,901
Now, when I was a girl,
we called these "gay deceivers."

1463
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:35,611
LAURA:
Mother, I won't wear these.

1464
01:08:35,653 --> 01:08:37,404
AMANDA:
Of course you'll wear them.

1465
01:08:37,404 --> 01:08:38,781
LAURA:
Well, why should I?

1466
01:08:38,823 --> 01:08:40,616
AMANDA:
Honey, to tell you the truth,

1467
01:08:40,658 --> 01:08:42,368
you are
a little bit flat-chested.

1468
01:08:42,409 --> 01:08:45,496
LAURA:
Well, you make it sound
like we're setting a trap.

1469
01:08:45,496 --> 01:08:47,414
AMANDA:
We are setting a trap.

1470
01:08:47,456 --> 01:08:49,583
All pretty girls are a trap,

1471
01:08:49,625 --> 01:08:51,752
and all men expect them
to be.

1472
01:08:51,794 --> 01:08:53,921
Now, come on.

1473
01:08:53,963 --> 01:08:56,298
Turn around.

1474
01:08:56,340 --> 01:08:58,425
Look at yourself
in the mirror.

1475
01:08:58,467 --> 01:09:00,594
Now, look.

1476
01:09:00,636 --> 01:09:02,763
Look.

1477
01:09:02,805 --> 01:09:04,932
Now, isn't that lovely?

1478
01:09:04,974 --> 01:09:07,726
You look just like
an angel on a postcard.

1479
01:09:07,726 --> 01:09:09,436
Now.

1480
01:09:09,478 --> 01:09:11,355
You run on out,

1481
01:09:11,397 --> 01:09:14,358
and I'm going
to dress myself all up.

1482
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:18,320
You're going to be astonished
at your mother's appearance.

1483
01:09:22,449 --> 01:09:24,952
AMANDA:
You know,

1484
01:09:24,994 --> 01:09:28,414
I found an old dress
in a trunk.

1485
01:09:28,455 --> 01:09:30,541
(laughing)

1486
01:09:33,544 --> 01:09:36,547
I had to do a lot to it.

1487
01:09:38,591 --> 01:09:40,259
You know, laura,

1488
01:09:40,301 --> 01:09:42,928
It broke my heart
when I had to let it out.

1489
01:09:42,970 --> 01:09:44,763
(thunder rumbling)

1490
01:09:44,805 --> 01:09:46,682
Oh, my!

1491
01:09:46,724 --> 01:09:48,434
Is that thunder?

1492
01:09:48,434 --> 01:09:50,019
Oh, my lord.

1493
01:09:50,060 --> 01:09:51,854
All right.

1494
01:09:51,896 --> 01:09:54,481
Now, Laura,
take a look at your mother.

1495
01:09:54,523 --> 01:09:56,025
Oh, no.

1496
01:09:56,066 --> 01:09:57,693
Wait.

1497
01:09:57,735 --> 01:09:59,820
Now look.

1498
01:09:59,862 --> 01:10:02,031
Take a look at your mother now.

1499
01:10:03,949 --> 01:10:05,868
Oh, mother.

1500
01:10:05,910 --> 01:10:08,037
How lovely.

1501
01:10:08,078 --> 01:10:10,539
Well,
it used to be.

1502
01:10:10,581 --> 01:10:12,791
It used to be.

1503
01:10:12,833 --> 01:10:15,085
It had a lot of flowers
all over it,

1504
01:10:15,085 --> 01:10:17,588
but they got kind of tired,

1505
01:10:17,630 --> 01:10:19,882
so I had
to take them all off.

1506
01:10:19,924 --> 01:10:22,760
I led the cotillion
in this dress

1507
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:25,638
a long time ago,

1508
01:10:25,679 --> 01:10:28,933
and I won the cakewalk
at Sunset Hill.

1509
01:10:28,974 --> 01:10:31,352
And I wore it

1510
01:10:31,393 --> 01:10:34,980
to the governor's ball
in Jackson.

1511
01:10:35,022 --> 01:10:37,358
Oh, laura.

1512
01:10:37,358 --> 01:10:39,526
You should have seen
your mother.

1513
01:10:39,526 --> 01:10:43,072
She just sashayed around
that ballroom just like that.

1514
01:10:43,072 --> 01:10:45,074
I had it on

1515
01:10:45,115 --> 01:10:48,786
the night I met your father.

1516
01:10:50,412 --> 01:10:52,414
I had malaria fever too.

1517
01:10:52,456 --> 01:10:55,668
The change of climate
from east Tennessee to the delta

1518
01:10:55,709 --> 01:10:57,670
had weakened my resistance.

1519
01:10:57,711 --> 01:10:59,713
Not enough to be dangerous,

1520
01:10:59,755 --> 01:11:02,549
but just enough
to make me restless and giddy.

1521
01:11:02,633 --> 01:11:05,052
Oh, it was lovely.

1522
01:11:05,094 --> 01:11:08,555
Invitations just poured in
from all over.

1523
01:11:08,597 --> 01:11:11,058
And my mother said,

1524
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:13,769
"Honey,
you can't go any place.

1525
01:11:13,811 --> 01:11:15,562
"You've got a fever.

1526
01:11:15,604 --> 01:11:18,357
You've got to stay in bed."

1527
01:11:18,399 --> 01:11:20,651
And I said I wouldn't,

1528
01:11:20,693 --> 01:11:22,695
and I just took quinine,

1529
01:11:22,736 --> 01:11:26,031
and I kept on going
and going.

1530
01:11:26,073 --> 01:11:28,993
Dances every evening,

1531
01:11:29,034 --> 01:11:31,620
and in the afternoons,

1532
01:11:31,662 --> 01:11:34,832
long drives
in the country.

1533
01:11:34,832 --> 01:11:37,418
And picnics.

1534
01:11:37,459 --> 01:11:39,837
Oh, Laura.

1535
01:11:39,837 --> 01:11:42,423
That country.

1536
01:11:42,464 --> 01:11:45,134
That country.

1537
01:11:45,217 --> 01:11:47,803
So lovely in May,

1538
01:11:47,845 --> 01:11:50,848
all lacy with dogwood

1539
01:11:50,889 --> 01:11:54,518
and simply flooded
with jonquils.

1540
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,478
And my mother said,

1541
01:11:56,520 --> 01:11:59,648
"Honey, you can't bring
any more jonquils in the house."

1542
01:11:59,690 --> 01:12:02,443
And I said, "I will."

1543
01:12:02,484 --> 01:12:04,570
And I just kept on
bringing them in.

1544
01:12:04,611 --> 01:12:06,697
Every time I saw them,
I'd say,

1545
01:12:06,739 --> 01:12:08,157
"Stop.

1546
01:12:08,198 --> 01:12:09,992
I see jonquils."

1547
01:12:09,992 --> 01:12:13,162
I'd make my gentlemen callers
get out of the carriage

1548
01:12:13,162 --> 01:12:14,955
and help me
to gather some.

1549
01:12:14,997 --> 01:12:17,082
It got to be kind of a joke.

1550
01:12:17,124 --> 01:12:19,793
They'd say,
"Look out.

1551
01:12:19,835 --> 01:12:21,962
"Here's comes that girl.

1552
01:12:22,004 --> 01:12:23,922
"We're going
to have to spend

1553
01:12:23,964 --> 01:12:27,509
the rest of the afternoon
picking jonquils."

1554
01:12:27,551 --> 01:12:28,886
My mother said,

1555
01:12:28,927 --> 01:12:32,931
"Honey, you can't bring
any more jonquils in the house.

1556
01:12:32,931 --> 01:12:36,477
We don't have enough vases
to hold them all.

1557
01:12:36,518 --> 01:12:38,937
I said,
"That's all right.

1558
01:12:38,979 --> 01:12:40,773
I'll hold some myself."

1559
01:12:42,858 --> 01:12:45,736
Malaria,
fever,

1560
01:12:45,778 --> 01:12:47,738
your father

1561
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:50,199
and jonquils.

1562
01:12:54,703 --> 01:12:57,122
(thunder rumbling)

1563
01:12:57,164 --> 01:12:59,541
Ooh.

1564
01:12:59,583 --> 01:13:02,211
Oh.

1565
01:13:02,252 --> 01:13:05,214
I hope they get here
before it starts to rain.

1566
01:13:05,255 --> 01:13:09,176
I gave your brother
a little extra change

1567
01:13:09,218 --> 01:13:13,180
so he and Mr. O'Connor could
take the service car home.

1568
01:13:15,641 --> 01:13:17,101
LAURA:
Mother?

1569
01:13:17,142 --> 01:13:18,727
AMANDA:
Mm?

1570
01:13:18,769 --> 01:13:20,729
LAURA:
What did you say his name is?

1571
01:13:20,771 --> 01:13:22,773
AMANDA:
Uh, O'Connor.

1572
01:13:22,815 --> 01:13:24,566
Why?

1573
01:13:24,608 --> 01:13:26,944
LAURA:
What is his first name?

1574
01:13:26,985 --> 01:13:29,196
AMANDA:
Ooh, honey,
I don't remember.

1575
01:13:29,238 --> 01:13:31,240
Oh, yes, I do.

1576
01:13:31,281 --> 01:13:33,158
It was Jim.

1577
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:35,577
Is he the one that Tom used
to go to high school with?

1578
01:13:35,577 --> 01:13:36,954
AMANDA:
He didn't say.

1579
01:13:36,995 --> 01:13:38,747
I think he just met him
at the warehouse.

1580
01:13:38,789 --> 01:13:41,125
Tom and I both used
to know Jim O'Connor

1581
01:13:41,166 --> 01:13:43,127
in high school.

1582
01:13:43,127 --> 01:13:45,212
if that is the one Tom
is bringing home to school,

1583
01:13:45,254 --> 01:13:46,839
you will have
to excuse me.

1584
01:13:46,839 --> 01:13:48,215
I won't come to the table.

1585
01:13:48,257 --> 01:13:51,677
Now,
what kind of silly talk is this?

1586
01:13:53,595 --> 01:13:55,848
LAURA:
You asked me once

1587
01:13:55,848 --> 01:13:59,017
if I ever liked a boy.

1588
01:13:59,017 --> 01:14:01,770
Remember,
I showed you his picture?

1589
01:14:01,812 --> 01:14:04,565
AMANDA:
You mean the boy
in the yearbook?

1590
01:14:04,565 --> 01:14:06,233
LAURA:
Yes, mother.

1591
01:14:06,233 --> 01:14:08,026
That boy.

1592
01:14:08,068 --> 01:14:09,695
AMANDA:
Oh, Laura.

1593
01:14:09,736 --> 01:14:11,738
Were you in love with that boy?

1594
01:14:11,780 --> 01:14:13,782
LAURA:
I don't know, mother.

1595
01:14:13,782 --> 01:14:16,285
I just know
that if it was him,

1596
01:14:16,285 --> 01:14:19,246
I couldn't sit at the table.

1597
01:14:19,288 --> 01:14:20,831
AMANDA:
Well, it won't be him;

1598
01:14:20,873 --> 01:14:22,833
it's not
in the least bit likely.

1599
01:14:22,833 --> 01:14:25,252
But even if it were,
you will come to the table.

1600
01:14:25,294 --> 01:14:27,254
You will not be excused.

1601
01:14:27,296 --> 01:14:29,089
(sighing)

1602
01:14:29,131 --> 01:14:31,049
LAURA:
I would have to be, mother.

1603
01:14:31,049 --> 01:14:34,636
AMANDA:
Laura, I don't intend
to humor your silliness.

1604
01:14:34,678 --> 01:14:37,181
Now, I've had enough
from you and your brother.

1605
01:14:37,222 --> 01:14:38,932
Now,
you just come on over here

1606
01:14:38,974 --> 01:14:40,601
and sit yourself down

1607
01:14:40,642 --> 01:14:42,603
and compose yourself
until they get here.

1608
01:14:42,644 --> 01:14:44,563
Now, your brother
has forgotten his key,

1609
01:14:44,605 --> 01:14:47,107
So you're going to have
to let them in when they arrive.

1610
01:14:47,107 --> 01:14:48,775
LAURA:
Oh, no, mother,
please.

1611
01:14:48,775 --> 01:14:50,235
You answer the door.

1612
01:14:50,277 --> 01:14:52,029
AMANDA:
But I haven't even finished

1613
01:14:52,070 --> 01:14:53,989
the mayonnaise dressing
for the salmon.

1614
01:14:54,031 --> 01:14:55,908
LAURA:
Mother, please, you answer it.

1615
01:14:55,949 --> 01:14:57,576
Don't make me do it.

1616
01:14:57,618 --> 01:14:59,077
AMANDA:
Laura, Laura.

1617
01:14:59,119 --> 01:15:00,746
Honey, please,
be reasonable.

1618
01:15:00,787 --> 01:15:02,247
What is all this fuss about?

1619
01:15:02,289 --> 01:15:04,917
He's just one gentleman caller,
darling, that's all.

1620
01:15:04,958 --> 01:15:06,877
Just one.

1621
01:15:14,301 --> 01:15:16,261
(doorbell ringing)

1622
01:15:16,303 --> 01:15:18,764
(gasping)

1623
01:15:18,764 --> 01:15:20,933
Mother.

1624
01:15:20,974 --> 01:15:23,268
Mother.

1625
01:15:23,268 --> 01:15:25,103
AMANDA:
Laura, honey!

1626
01:15:25,103 --> 01:15:27,231
The door.

1627
01:15:27,272 --> 01:15:29,107
LAURA:
Mother, you--

1628
01:15:29,149 --> 01:15:30,984
You answer the door.

1629
01:15:30,984 --> 01:15:33,779
AMANDA:
What is the matter with you,
you silly thing?

1630
01:15:33,820 --> 01:15:35,364
LAURA:
Mother, please, you answer it.

1631
01:15:35,405 --> 01:15:36,615
Please.

1632
01:15:36,657 --> 01:15:40,619
AMANDA:
Why have you taken this moment
to lose your mind?

1633
01:15:40,661 --> 01:15:42,329
Now, go to the door.

1634
01:15:42,371 --> 01:15:44,623
LAURA:
I can't.

1635
01:15:44,665 --> 01:15:46,750
AMANDA:
Why can't you?

1636
01:15:46,750 --> 01:15:48,418
LAURA:
I'm sick.

1637
01:15:48,418 --> 01:15:50,087
AMANDA:
You're sick?

1638
01:15:50,128 --> 01:15:51,964
Am I sick?

1639
01:15:52,005 --> 01:15:54,841
You and your brother
have me puzzled to death.

1640
01:15:54,925 --> 01:15:57,094
You could never act
like normal children.

1641
01:15:57,135 --> 01:15:58,762
Will you give me one good reason

1642
01:15:58,762 --> 01:16:00,806
why you should be afraid
to go to a door?

1643
01:16:00,806 --> 01:16:02,182
(doorbell ringing)

1644
01:16:02,224 --> 01:16:03,850
Laura, go to the door!

1645
01:16:06,937 --> 01:16:08,772
Laura Wingfield,

1646
01:16:08,814 --> 01:16:11,316
you march straight
to that door.

1647
01:16:16,029 --> 01:16:18,240
(knocking)

1648
01:16:18,282 --> 01:16:20,409
LAURA:
Yes, mother.

1649
01:16:30,794 --> 01:16:32,754
AMANDA:
Honey,

1650
01:16:32,796 --> 01:16:35,966
I have to put courage in you
for living.

1651
01:16:48,395 --> 01:16:50,731
TOM:
Laura,

1652
01:16:50,731 --> 01:16:52,274
This is Jim.

1653
01:16:52,316 --> 01:16:55,027
Jim,
this is my sister, Laura.

1654
01:16:55,068 --> 01:16:57,821
I didn't know Shakespeare
had a sister.

1655
01:16:57,863 --> 01:16:59,823
How are you, laura?

1656
01:16:59,865 --> 01:17:01,950
LAURA:
How do you do?

1657
01:17:01,992 --> 01:17:03,994
JIM O'CONNOR:
Well, I'm okay.

1658
01:17:04,036 --> 01:17:05,746
Your hand is cold, Laura.

1659
01:17:05,787 --> 01:17:07,331
LAURA:
Yes, well,

1660
01:17:07,331 --> 01:17:09,333
I've been playing
the Victrola and--

1661
01:17:09,333 --> 01:17:11,084
JIM:
Oh.

1662
01:17:11,126 --> 01:17:13,462
You must have been playing
classical music on it.

1663
01:17:13,503 --> 01:17:16,173
You ought to put a little
hot swing on to warm you up.

1664
01:17:23,180 --> 01:17:25,140
What's the matter?

1665
01:17:25,182 --> 01:17:26,725
TOM:
With Laura?

1666
01:17:26,767 --> 01:17:28,143
Laura's terribly shy.

1667
01:17:28,185 --> 01:17:29,811
JIM:
Shy, huh?

1668
01:17:29,853 --> 01:17:32,939
You know, it is unusual
to meet a shy girl nowadays.

1669
01:17:32,981 --> 01:17:34,733
(clearing throat)

1670
01:17:34,775 --> 01:17:37,361
I don't believe you ever told me
you had a sister.

1671
01:17:37,402 --> 01:17:39,112
TOM:
Now you know.

1672
01:17:39,154 --> 01:17:40,989
I have one.

1673
01:17:41,031 --> 01:17:42,407
Here's the post dispatch.

1674
01:17:42,449 --> 01:17:43,992
You want
a piece of it?

1675
01:17:44,034 --> 01:17:45,410
JIM:
Yeah.

1676
01:17:45,452 --> 01:17:46,995
TOM:
What piece?

1677
01:17:47,037 --> 01:17:48,413
Comics?

1678
01:17:48,455 --> 01:17:50,040
JIM:
Comics?

1679
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:52,167
Sports.

1680
01:17:54,211 --> 01:17:55,796
Oh, well.

1681
01:17:55,837 --> 01:17:58,006
I see that dizzy dean
is on his bad behavior.

1682
01:17:58,048 --> 01:17:59,424
TOM:
Mm-hmm.

1683
01:18:04,054 --> 01:18:06,056
JIM:
Where are you going?

1684
01:18:06,098 --> 01:18:08,433
TOM:
Out on the terrace to smoke.

1685
01:18:24,908 --> 01:18:26,535
Shakespeare.

1686
01:18:26,576 --> 01:18:28,829
I'm going to sell you
a bill of goods.

1687
01:18:28,870 --> 01:18:30,247
What goods?

1688
01:18:30,247 --> 01:18:31,957
Course I'm taking.

1689
01:18:31,998 --> 01:18:33,792
Hmm?

1690
01:18:33,834 --> 01:18:36,461
A course in public speaking.

1691
01:18:39,005 --> 01:18:41,133
You know,

1692
01:18:41,133 --> 01:18:43,301
you and me,
we're not the warehouse type.

1693
01:18:43,343 --> 01:18:44,928
TOM:
Thanks.

1694
01:18:44,928 --> 01:18:46,304
That's good news.

1695
01:18:46,346 --> 01:18:48,557
But what has public speaking
got to do with it?

1696
01:18:48,598 --> 01:18:51,184
It fits you
for executive positions.

1697
01:18:51,226 --> 01:18:53,854
I tell you, it's done
a hell of a lot for me.

1698
01:18:53,895 --> 01:18:55,272
In what respect?

1699
01:18:55,313 --> 01:18:56,857
In all respects.

1700
01:18:56,898 --> 01:18:58,275
Ask yourself,

1701
01:18:58,316 --> 01:19:00,026
what's the difference

1702
01:19:00,068 --> 01:19:02,446
between you and me and the guys
in the office down front?

1703
01:19:02,487 --> 01:19:04,156
- Brains?
- No.

1704
01:19:04,197 --> 01:19:05,574
Ability?

1705
01:19:05,574 --> 01:19:07,576
No.

1706
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:11,496
Then what?

1707
01:19:11,538 --> 01:19:13,165
Well, primarily,
Shakespeare,

1708
01:19:13,206 --> 01:19:15,167
It amounts
to just one single thing.

1709
01:19:15,208 --> 01:19:16,877
What is that single thing?

1710
01:19:16,918 --> 01:19:18,462
Social poise --

1711
01:19:18,462 --> 01:19:20,964
the ability to be able
to square up to somebody

1712
01:19:21,006 --> 01:19:22,924
and hold your own
on any social level.

1713
01:19:22,966 --> 01:19:24,468
AMANDA:
Tom?

1714
01:19:24,509 --> 01:19:26,094
Yes, mother?

1715
01:19:26,136 --> 01:19:27,554
AMANDA:
Is that you and Mr. O'Connor?

1716
01:19:27,596 --> 01:19:29,181
TOM:
Yes, mother.

1717
01:19:29,181 --> 01:19:31,266
AMANDA:
You all make yourselves
comfortable.

1718
01:19:31,308 --> 01:19:32,893
TOM:
Yes, mother.

1719
01:19:32,934 --> 01:19:34,519
AMANDA:
Ask Mr. O'Connor if he'd like

1720
01:19:34,561 --> 01:19:36,146
to wash his hands.

1721
01:19:36,188 --> 01:19:37,564
JIM:
No, thank you, ma'am.

1722
01:19:37,606 --> 01:19:40,400
Took care of that already
down at the warehouse.

1723
01:19:44,196 --> 01:19:45,906
Tom.

1724
01:19:45,947 --> 01:19:47,282
TOM:
Mm-hmm?

1725
01:19:47,324 --> 01:19:50,160
Mr. Mendoza's been speaking
to me about you.

1726
01:19:50,202 --> 01:19:51,953
Favorably?

1727
01:19:51,995 --> 01:19:53,580
What do you think?

1728
01:19:53,622 --> 01:19:55,165
Well--

1729
01:19:55,207 --> 01:19:57,459
You're going to be out of a job
if you don't wake up.

1730
01:19:57,501 --> 01:19:59,294
I am waking up.

1731
01:19:59,336 --> 01:20:00,921
You show no signs.

1732
01:20:00,962 --> 01:20:02,923
The signs
are interior.

1733
01:20:02,964 --> 01:20:04,883
I'm planning a change.

1734
01:20:04,925 --> 01:20:07,302
I am right at the point
of committing myself

1735
01:20:07,344 --> 01:20:10,055
to a future which doesn't
include Mr. Mendoza

1736
01:20:10,096 --> 01:20:12,057
or the warehouse

1737
01:20:12,098 --> 01:20:14,976
or even a night-school course
in public speaking.

1738
01:20:15,018 --> 01:20:17,395
What are you gassing about?

1739
01:20:17,395 --> 01:20:19,022
I'm tired
of the movies.

1740
01:20:19,064 --> 01:20:20,440
JIM:
The movies?

1741
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:22,275
Yes, movies.

1742
01:20:22,275 --> 01:20:24,110
Look at them.

1743
01:20:24,110 --> 01:20:27,155
All those glamorous people
out there having adventures,

1744
01:20:27,197 --> 01:20:29,032
hogging it all,

1745
01:20:29,074 --> 01:20:30,659
gobbling
the whole thing up.

1746
01:20:30,700 --> 01:20:32,494
You know what happens?

1747
01:20:32,536 --> 01:20:34,913
People go to the movies
instead of moving.

1748
01:20:34,955 --> 01:20:37,207
Hollywood characters
are supposed to have

1749
01:20:37,207 --> 01:20:39,334
The adventure for everyone
in America,

1750
01:20:39,376 --> 01:20:42,045
While everyone in America
just sits in a dark room

1751
01:20:42,087 --> 01:20:43,713
and watches them have them

1752
01:20:43,755 --> 01:20:45,549
until there's a war.

1753
01:20:45,590 --> 01:20:48,552
That's when adventure
becomes available to the masses.

1754
01:20:48,552 --> 01:20:50,512
everyone's dish,
not only Gable's.

1755
01:20:50,554 --> 01:20:54,432
Then the people in the dark room
can come out of the dark room

1756
01:20:54,432 --> 01:20:57,435
and have a little adventure
for themselves.

1757
01:20:57,435 --> 01:20:59,646
Goody-goody.

1758
01:20:59,646 --> 01:21:02,315
It's our turn now to be exotic,
far off.

1759
01:21:02,315 --> 01:21:05,151
But, uh,
I am not patient,

1760
01:21:05,193 --> 01:21:08,321
and I'm not going to wait
until then.

1761
01:21:08,363 --> 01:21:12,117
I am tired of the movies
and I am about to move.

1762
01:21:12,158 --> 01:21:13,535
Move?

1763
01:21:13,535 --> 01:21:15,620
- Yes.
- When?

1764
01:21:15,662 --> 01:21:18,248
Soon.

1765
01:21:18,248 --> 01:21:19,624
JIM:
Where?

1766
01:21:19,666 --> 01:21:22,294
TOM:
I am starting to boil inside.

1767
01:21:22,335 --> 01:21:24,754
I know that I seem dreamy,

1768
01:21:24,796 --> 01:21:27,382
but whenever
I pick up a shoe,

1769
01:21:27,424 --> 01:21:31,094
I just shudder a little,
thinking how short life is

1770
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:34,097
and what am I doing?

1771
01:21:34,139 --> 01:21:36,600
Whatever that means,
I know it does not mean shoes,

1772
01:21:36,641 --> 01:21:39,436
except as something to wear
on the traveller's feet.

1773
01:21:39,477 --> 01:21:41,187
Look.

1774
01:21:41,229 --> 01:21:45,025
"The Union of Merchant seamen"?

1775
01:21:45,066 --> 01:21:46,443
Yes.

1776
01:21:46,484 --> 01:21:48,695
I paid my dues last month
instead of the light bill.

1777
01:21:48,737 --> 01:21:51,197
You're going to regret it
when they turn the lights off.

1778
01:21:51,239 --> 01:21:53,116
I won't be here.

1779
01:21:53,158 --> 01:21:54,534
What about your mother?

1780
01:21:54,576 --> 01:21:56,578
I'm like my father.

1781
01:21:56,578 --> 01:21:58,622
The bastard son
of a bastard.

1782
01:21:58,622 --> 01:22:02,125
Did you notice how he's grinning
in his picture in there?

1783
01:22:02,125 --> 01:22:04,252
He's been absent
going on 16 years.

1784
01:22:04,294 --> 01:22:06,296
You're just talking,

1785
01:22:06,296 --> 01:22:08,089
You drip.

1786
01:22:08,131 --> 01:22:10,342
What is your mother going
to say about that?

1787
01:22:10,342 --> 01:22:13,511
TOM:
Mother is not acquainted
with my plans.

1788
01:22:17,307 --> 01:22:19,017
AMANDA:
Tom?

1789
01:22:19,059 --> 01:22:20,393
Yes, mother?

1790
01:22:20,435 --> 01:22:22,103
Where are you all?

1791
01:22:22,145 --> 01:22:23,772
We're on the terrace,
mother.

1792
01:22:23,813 --> 01:22:25,482
Well,

1793
01:22:25,523 --> 01:22:28,193
why don't you all
come on inside?

1794
01:22:45,085 --> 01:22:48,046
Mother,
you look so pretty.

1795
01:22:48,088 --> 01:22:49,464
You know,

1796
01:22:49,506 --> 01:22:52,133
that is the first compliment
you have ever paid me.

1797
01:22:52,175 --> 01:22:53,510
I wish you'd look pleasant

1798
01:22:53,510 --> 01:22:55,762
when you're about
to say something pleasant,

1799
01:22:55,804 --> 01:22:57,389
so i'd know to expect it.

1800
01:22:57,389 --> 01:22:58,765
Mr. O'Connor.

1801
01:22:58,807 --> 01:23:00,392
Well, how do you do,
ma'am?

1802
01:23:00,392 --> 01:23:01,726
AMANDA:
Well, well.

1803
01:23:01,768 --> 01:23:03,395
So this is Mr. O'Connor.

1804
01:23:03,436 --> 01:23:06,356
Well, introductions
are entirely unnecessary,

1805
01:23:06,398 --> 01:23:09,150
because I've heard so much
about you from my boy.

1806
01:23:09,192 --> 01:23:10,777
I finally said to him,
I said,

1807
01:23:10,819 --> 01:23:12,404
"Tom, why don't you bring

1808
01:23:12,445 --> 01:23:14,698
"This paragon home to supper
finally?

1809
01:23:14,739 --> 01:23:18,076
"I want to meet this nice
young man from the warehouse

1810
01:23:18,118 --> 01:23:21,579
instead of just hearing you
sing his praises all the time."

1811
01:23:21,621 --> 01:23:23,498
I don't know why my son
is so standoffish.

1812
01:23:23,540 --> 01:23:25,083
That is not southern behavior.

1813
01:23:25,125 --> 01:23:26,501
Well, let's sit down.

1814
01:23:26,543 --> 01:23:28,086
(sighing)

1815
01:23:28,128 --> 01:23:29,587
Let's sit down.

1816
01:23:29,629 --> 01:23:31,256
You know, Tom,

1817
01:23:31,256 --> 01:23:33,425
I think we could use
a little air in here.

1818
01:23:33,425 --> 01:23:36,052
You want to leave the door open?

1819
01:23:36,094 --> 01:23:37,846
I felt a nice fresh breeze
a while ago.

1820
01:23:37,887 --> 01:23:40,223
I don't know where it's gone to.

1821
01:23:40,265 --> 01:23:42,767
It's so warm already,
and it's not even summer yet.

1822
01:23:42,809 --> 01:23:45,729
We're going to burn up
when summer finally gets here.

1823
01:23:45,770 --> 01:23:48,565
However, we are having
a light supper this evening.

1824
01:23:48,606 --> 01:23:51,484
I think light things are better
for this time of year,

1825
01:23:51,484 --> 01:23:53,361
like light clothes are

1826
01:23:53,403 --> 01:23:55,238
and light food.

1827
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:57,115
Light clothes --

1828
01:23:57,157 --> 01:23:58,783
What warm weather calls for.

1829
01:23:58,825 --> 01:24:01,703
Because, you see, our blood gets
so thick in the winter

1830
01:24:01,745 --> 01:24:03,621
that it takes a little while
for us

1831
01:24:03,663 --> 01:24:05,915
to re-adjust ourselves
when summer comes.

1832
01:24:05,915 --> 01:24:07,792
But it comes so quickly.

1833
01:24:07,834 --> 01:24:09,669
I just wasn't prepared
for it.

1834
01:24:09,711 --> 01:24:11,588
Just good heavens!

1835
01:24:11,629 --> 01:24:13,465
All of a sudden
it was summertime.

1836
01:24:13,506 --> 01:24:15,341
So I just ran to the trunk

1837
01:24:15,383 --> 01:24:17,177
and pulled out
this light dress.

1838
01:24:17,218 --> 01:24:18,845
It's terribly old.

1839
01:24:18,887 --> 01:24:20,847
It's practically historical.

1840
01:24:20,889 --> 01:24:23,600
But it feels so good and cool,
you know?

1841
01:24:23,641 --> 01:24:25,143
TOM:
Mother?

1842
01:24:25,185 --> 01:24:26,561
AMANDA:
Hmm?

1843
01:24:26,603 --> 01:24:28,188
How about supper?

1844
01:24:28,229 --> 01:24:30,482
Well, honey,

1845
01:24:30,523 --> 01:24:32,901
You have
to ask sister about supper.

1846
01:24:32,942 --> 01:24:35,403
Well,
you know sister

1847
01:24:35,445 --> 01:24:37,363
is in full charge of supper.

1848
01:24:37,405 --> 01:24:38,782
You just tell her

1849
01:24:38,823 --> 01:24:40,825
you hungry boys
are waiting for her, hmm?

1850
01:24:40,867 --> 01:24:42,911
Well, run on,
sweetie.

1851
01:24:42,952 --> 01:24:45,246
Did you meet Laura?

1852
01:24:45,288 --> 01:24:46,873
JIM:
Well, she came to the door.

1853
01:24:46,915 --> 01:24:48,708
AMANDA:
She let you in, hmm?

1854
01:24:48,750 --> 01:24:50,543
JIM:
Yes, ma'am.

1855
01:24:50,585 --> 01:24:52,462
AMANDA:
She is pretty, isn't she?

1856
01:24:52,462 --> 01:24:54,422
Oh, yes, ma'am.

1857
01:24:54,464 --> 01:24:57,217
AMANDA:
You know,
it is so rare for a young girl

1858
01:24:57,258 --> 01:24:59,427
who is as sweet and as pretty
as Laura is

1859
01:24:59,469 --> 01:25:01,387
to also be domestic.

1860
01:25:01,429 --> 01:25:03,348
But Laura is,
thank heavens.

1861
01:25:03,389 --> 01:25:05,350
Not only sweet and pretty,

1862
01:25:05,391 --> 01:25:07,310
but also very,
very domestic,

1863
01:25:07,352 --> 01:25:09,354
because I am not at all.

1864
01:25:09,354 --> 01:25:11,898
I could never make a thing
but angel food cake.

1865
01:25:11,898 --> 01:25:14,567
But, of course, in the South,
you know,

1866
01:25:14,609 --> 01:25:16,694
we had so many servants.

1867
01:25:16,736 --> 01:25:18,947
Gone, gone, gone.

1868
01:25:18,988 --> 01:25:22,408
All vestiges
of gracious living

1869
01:25:22,450 --> 01:25:25,662
just gone completely.

1870
01:25:25,703 --> 01:25:27,664
See,
I wasn't prepared

1871
01:25:27,664 --> 01:25:30,208
for what life had in store
for me,

1872
01:25:30,250 --> 01:25:32,502
because all my gentlemen callers

1873
01:25:32,544 --> 01:25:34,963
were planters
and sons of planters,

1874
01:25:35,004 --> 01:25:37,841
so naturally
I thought I would marry one,

1875
01:25:37,882 --> 01:25:40,343
and I was just going
to raise my family

1876
01:25:40,385 --> 01:25:43,888
on a large plot of land
with lots and lots of servants.

1877
01:25:43,930 --> 01:25:46,391
But man proposes

1878
01:25:46,391 --> 01:25:48,643
and woman accepts
the proposal,

1879
01:25:48,685 --> 01:25:51,771
to vary that old saying
a little bit.

1880
01:25:51,813 --> 01:25:53,940
Well, I married no planter.

1881
01:25:53,982 --> 01:25:57,652
I married a man who worked for
the telephone company,

1882
01:25:57,694 --> 01:26:01,239
that gallantly smiling gentleman
over there.

1883
01:26:01,281 --> 01:26:04,742
Telephone man who fell in love
with long distance.

1884
01:26:04,784 --> 01:26:06,369
And now he travels,

1885
01:26:06,411 --> 01:26:08,788
and I don't even know where.

1886
01:26:08,830 --> 01:26:10,415
Oh, well.

1887
01:26:10,456 --> 01:26:12,959
Now, why am I going on
about my tribulation?

1888
01:26:13,001 --> 01:26:14,919
Now, you tell me about yours.

1889
01:26:14,961 --> 01:26:18,256
Because I hope
you don't have any.

1890
01:26:18,298 --> 01:26:20,341
Tom!

1891
01:26:20,383 --> 01:26:21,926
TOM:
Yes, mother?

1892
01:26:21,968 --> 01:26:24,554
AMANDA:
Well, honey,
what about supper?

1893
01:26:24,596 --> 01:26:26,431
TOM:
Well, it appears to me

1894
01:26:26,472 --> 01:26:28,600
that supper's on the table,
mother.

1895
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:30,602
AMANDA:
Well, so it is.

1896
01:26:30,602 --> 01:26:32,687
Oh!

1897
01:26:32,729 --> 01:26:35,481
Oh, now,
isn't that lovely?

1898
01:26:35,523 --> 01:26:37,400
Now, where's Laura?

1899
01:26:37,442 --> 01:26:39,903
TOM:
Well,
Laura's not feeling too well.

1900
01:26:39,944 --> 01:26:41,613
She says she thinks

1901
01:26:41,654 --> 01:26:44,407
she'd better not come
to the table.

1902
01:26:44,449 --> 01:26:46,534
AMANDA:
Laura!

1903
01:26:46,576 --> 01:26:48,453
Mr. O'Connor?

1904
01:26:52,540 --> 01:26:54,751
Right here.

1905
01:26:54,792 --> 01:26:56,836
Laura?

1906
01:26:56,878 --> 01:26:58,796
Honey?

1907
01:26:58,796 --> 01:27:01,090
We can't say grace

1908
01:27:01,132 --> 01:27:03,927
until you come
to the table.

1909
01:27:30,036 --> 01:27:32,080
Oh, my Hod!

1910
01:27:32,121 --> 01:27:33,998
Oh, no!

1911
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:36,793
Tom,
take her over to the sofa.

1912
01:27:39,128 --> 01:27:41,547
Oh, Laura.

1913
01:27:41,589 --> 01:27:43,967
Honey,
you are ill.

1914
01:27:43,967 --> 01:27:45,927
Oh, sweetheart.

1915
01:27:45,969 --> 01:27:48,429
Standing over
that hot stove

1916
01:27:48,471 --> 01:27:49,847
has just made her ill.

1917
01:27:49,847 --> 01:27:51,599
I told her it was just too warm,
but--

1918
01:27:51,641 --> 01:27:54,060
Oh, Mr. O'Connor.
here.

1919
01:27:54,102 --> 01:27:55,687
You just--

1920
01:27:55,687 --> 01:27:57,063
Oh, please.

1921
01:27:57,105 --> 01:27:58,690
Come sit down.

1922
01:27:58,731 --> 01:28:00,608
Would you like
a little dandelion wine?

1923
01:28:00,650 --> 01:28:02,026
JIM:
Well, all right, ma'am.

1924
01:28:02,068 --> 01:28:03,611
Thank you.

1925
01:28:03,653 --> 01:28:05,446
AMANDA:
Tom, is she all right?

1926
01:28:05,446 --> 01:28:07,365
TOM:
Yes, mother.

1927
01:28:07,407 --> 01:28:08,866
(thunder rumbling)

1928
01:28:08,908 --> 01:28:11,077
Ooh!

1929
01:28:11,119 --> 01:28:13,705
Looks like we're going
to have some rain.

1930
01:28:13,746 --> 01:28:15,832
(breathing heavily)

1931
01:28:19,919 --> 01:28:21,963
AMANDA:
Tom.

1932
01:28:24,549 --> 01:28:26,676
Would you say grace?

1933
01:28:26,676 --> 01:28:29,512
TOM:
No, thanks.

1934
01:28:29,512 --> 01:28:31,097
AMANDA:
Honey, now,

1935
01:28:31,139 --> 01:28:33,975
what do we say before we sit
and have some dinner?

1936
01:28:34,017 --> 01:28:36,102
We say grace,
don't we?

1937
01:28:42,984 --> 01:28:45,153
(Amanda laughing)

1938
01:28:45,194 --> 01:28:47,488
JIM:
That's the kind of thing.

1939
01:28:49,615 --> 01:28:51,492
AMANDA:
Oh, Mr. O'Connor.

1940
01:28:51,534 --> 01:28:54,120
I haven't had
such a lovely evening

1941
01:28:54,162 --> 01:28:56,080
in a very long time.

1942
01:28:56,122 --> 01:28:58,708
JIM:
Well, well, Mrs. wingfield.

1943
01:28:58,750 --> 01:29:01,085
Let me give you a toast.

1944
01:29:01,127 --> 01:29:03,588
Here is
to the old South.

1945
01:29:03,629 --> 01:29:06,215
AMANDA:
To the old South.

1946
01:29:06,257 --> 01:29:08,384
JIM:
Hey, Mr. Lightbulb.

1947
01:29:08,426 --> 01:29:09,802
AMANDA:
Well.

1948
01:29:09,844 --> 01:29:12,096
Now, where was Moses
when the lights went out?

1949
01:29:12,138 --> 01:29:14,766
Do you know the answer
to that one, Mr. O'Connor?

1950
01:29:14,766 --> 01:29:16,100
JIM:
No, ma'am, I don't.

1951
01:29:16,142 --> 01:29:17,393
What is the answer
to that one?

1952
01:29:17,435 --> 01:29:20,646
AMANDA:
Well, I did know one answer,
but it wasn't very nice,

1953
01:29:20,688 --> 01:29:22,815
so I thought maybe
you might know another one.

1954
01:29:22,857 --> 01:29:24,150
JIM:
No, ma'am, I don't.

1955
01:29:24,150 --> 01:29:27,111
AMANDA:
Well, it's a good thing
I put this candle on the table.

1956
01:29:27,153 --> 01:29:28,696
I just put it on for decoration,

1957
01:29:28,738 --> 01:29:30,531
but it's nice
when it proves useful too.

1958
01:29:30,573 --> 01:29:32,992
Now, if one of you gentlemen
could provide me with a match,

1959
01:29:33,034 --> 01:29:34,827
then we can have
a little illumination.

1960
01:29:34,869 --> 01:29:36,746
JIM:
Well, I believe I can do that,
ma'am.

1961
01:29:36,746 --> 01:29:38,247
Well, uh,

1962
01:29:38,247 --> 01:29:39,999
I guess it must be
a burnt-out fuse.

1963
01:29:40,041 --> 01:29:42,126
Do you know anything
about burnt-out fuses,

1964
01:29:42,168 --> 01:29:43,836
Mr. O'Connor?

1965
01:29:43,878 --> 01:29:45,630
JIM:
As a matter of fact,
I do, ma'am.

1966
01:29:45,671 --> 01:29:47,131
Where's the fuse box?

1967
01:29:47,173 --> 01:29:48,966
AMANDA:
Oh, you have to know that too?

1968
01:29:49,050 --> 01:29:50,843
Well, it's over there
in the kitchen.

1969
01:29:50,885 --> 01:29:53,679
Don't stumble over anything,
because it's dark out there.

1970
01:29:53,721 --> 01:29:55,181
(clattering)

1971
01:29:55,223 --> 01:29:56,891
Oh, my Lord.

1972
01:29:56,933 --> 01:29:58,601
Wouldn't it be awful
if we lost him?

1973
01:29:58,643 --> 01:30:00,103
Mr. O'Connor,
are you all right?

1974
01:30:00,144 --> 01:30:01,854
JIM:
Yes, ma'am.

1975
01:30:01,854 --> 01:30:03,523
I'm all right.

1976
01:30:03,564 --> 01:30:05,566
AMANDA:
You know, Mr. O'Connor,

1977
01:30:05,608 --> 01:30:08,569
I think electricity
is a very mysterious thing.

1978
01:30:08,611 --> 01:30:10,613
Of course, you know,

1979
01:30:10,655 --> 01:30:12,990
the whole universe
is mysterious to me.

1980
01:30:13,032 --> 01:30:16,619
Now, wasn't it Benjamin Franklin
that tied a key to a kite?

1981
01:30:16,661 --> 01:30:18,704
I would love to have seen that.

1982
01:30:18,746 --> 01:30:20,790
He must have looked
pretty silly.

1983
01:30:20,832 --> 01:30:22,875
Did you find it all right?

1984
01:30:22,917 --> 01:30:24,919
JIM:
Yes, ma'am, I did,

1985
01:30:24,961 --> 01:30:28,089
but them fuses
looked okay to me.

1986
01:30:28,131 --> 01:30:30,842
AMANDA:
Tom.

1987
01:30:30,925 --> 01:30:32,969
Yes, mother?

1988
01:30:33,010 --> 01:30:36,097
Do you remember that light bill
I gave you a few days ago,

1989
01:30:36,139 --> 01:30:37,849
the one I got
the notice about?

1990
01:30:37,849 --> 01:30:40,601
You mean last month's bill?

1991
01:30:40,643 --> 01:30:43,521
You didn't neglect it,
did you?

1992
01:30:43,521 --> 01:30:45,648
Well, I--

1993
01:30:45,690 --> 01:30:47,859
You did.
I might have known.

1994
01:30:47,900 --> 01:30:51,237
JIM:
Well, maybe Shakespeare
wrote a poem on that light bill.

1995
01:30:51,279 --> 01:30:52,447
AMANDA:
Maybe he did too.

1996
01:30:52,488 --> 01:30:56,784
However, it was nice of them
to let us finish our dinner

1997
01:30:56,826 --> 01:31:00,580
before they plunged us
into everlasting darkness.

1998
01:31:00,621 --> 01:31:02,623
Now, Tom,
as a penalty to your negligence,

1999
01:31:02,665 --> 01:31:04,083
you may help me with the dishes.

2000
01:31:04,125 --> 01:31:06,169
JIM:
Oh, well,
can I be of some help, ma'am?

2001
01:31:06,210 --> 01:31:08,296
AMANDA:
Oh, no.
I couldn't have that.

2002
01:31:08,337 --> 01:31:10,047
JIM:
I ought
to be good for something.

2003
01:31:10,047 --> 01:31:11,632
AMANDA:
What did I hear?

2004
01:31:11,674 --> 01:31:13,134
JIM:
"I ought
to be good for something."

2005
01:31:13,176 --> 01:31:15,178
That's what I thought I heard.

2006
01:31:15,219 --> 01:31:18,556
Laura is all by her lonesome
out there in the front.

2007
01:31:18,598 --> 01:31:20,266
Would you like
to keep her company?

2008
01:31:20,308 --> 01:31:21,851
I can give you

2009
01:31:21,893 --> 01:31:24,979
this lovely old candelabrum
for light.

2010
01:31:25,021 --> 01:31:26,606
It used to stand on the altar

2011
01:31:26,606 --> 01:31:28,191
of the Church
of the Heavenly Rest--

2012
01:31:28,232 --> 01:31:29,775
Would you--

2013
01:31:29,817 --> 01:31:32,570
And it melted
a little out of shape

2014
01:31:32,612 --> 01:31:34,280
when the church burnt down.

2015
01:31:34,322 --> 01:31:37,325
You see, the church
was struck by lightning

2016
01:31:37,366 --> 01:31:39,327
one spring,
and Gypsy Jones,

2017
01:31:39,368 --> 01:31:42,830
who was having a revival meeting
in the village,

2018
01:31:42,872 --> 01:31:44,999
said that the church
was struck by lightning

2019
01:31:45,041 --> 01:31:47,877
because the Episcopalians
were having card parties

2020
01:31:47,919 --> 01:31:49,629
right there in the church.

2021
01:31:49,670 --> 01:31:51,255
JIM:
Is that so, ma'am?

2022
01:31:51,255 --> 01:31:53,674
AMANDA:
I never say anything
that isn't so.

2023
01:31:53,716 --> 01:31:55,218
JIM:
Oh, I beg your pardon.

2024
01:31:55,259 --> 01:31:58,596
AMANDA:
Well, i'd like for Laura
to have a little dandelion.

2025
01:31:58,596 --> 01:32:00,139
You think you could manage
both of those?

2026
01:32:00,181 --> 01:32:01,766
JIM:
I can sure try, ma'am.

2027
01:32:01,766 --> 01:32:05,102
Well, um, Tom.

2028
01:32:05,102 --> 01:32:08,189
You get into your apron.

2029
01:32:23,704 --> 01:32:25,414
Well, how are you feeling?

2030
01:32:25,414 --> 01:32:27,250
Any better?

2031
01:32:27,250 --> 01:32:29,043
LAURA:
Yes.

2032
01:32:29,085 --> 01:32:30,795
Thank you.

2033
01:32:30,836 --> 01:32:32,380
JIM:
Good.

2034
01:32:32,421 --> 01:32:33,965
Oh, here.

2035
01:32:34,006 --> 01:32:36,133
This is for you.
it's a little dandelion wine.

2036
01:32:36,133 --> 01:32:38,177
Oh.
Thank you.

2037
01:32:41,222 --> 01:32:43,391
You drink it,

2038
01:32:43,432 --> 01:32:45,768
but don't get drunk.

2039
01:32:45,810 --> 01:32:47,979
Say, where am I going
to put these candles?

2040
01:32:48,020 --> 01:32:49,855
LAURA:
Oh, anywhere.

2041
01:32:49,897 --> 01:32:52,316
JIM:
Well, how about right here
on the floor?

2042
01:32:52,358 --> 01:32:54,193
You got any objections?

2043
01:32:54,193 --> 01:32:56,195
LAURA:
No.

2044
01:32:56,237 --> 01:32:59,323
JIM:
I'll just spread
some newspaper out here

2045
01:32:59,365 --> 01:33:01,158
to catch the drippings.

2046
01:33:01,200 --> 01:33:02,910
Say,
I like to sit on the floor.

2047
01:33:02,910 --> 01:33:04,829
Do you mind if I do?

2048
01:33:04,870 --> 01:33:06,247
No.

2049
01:33:06,289 --> 01:33:08,040
(sighing)

2050
01:33:08,082 --> 01:33:10,126
Would you hand me a pillow?

2051
01:33:16,966 --> 01:33:19,218
Thanks.

2052
01:33:21,470 --> 01:33:23,431
(sighing)

2053
01:33:23,472 --> 01:33:25,182
Well, how about you?

2054
01:33:25,224 --> 01:33:28,019
Don't you like
to sit on the floor?

2055
01:33:28,019 --> 01:33:31,063
Yes.

2056
01:33:31,063 --> 01:33:32,898
Well, why don't you,
then?

2057
01:33:32,898 --> 01:33:35,109
I will, I will.

2058
01:33:35,151 --> 01:33:37,069
Here, take a pillow.

2059
01:33:44,118 --> 01:33:45,911
Well, now,

2060
01:33:45,953 --> 01:33:48,497
I can't even see you
if you sit way over there.

2061
01:33:48,497 --> 01:33:51,167
I can see you.

2062
01:33:51,167 --> 01:33:52,752
Yeah,
but that's not fair.

2063
01:33:52,793 --> 01:33:54,211
I'm right here
in the limelight.

2064
01:34:00,134 --> 01:34:01,802
Yeah,
that's better.

2065
01:34:01,844 --> 01:34:03,721
Now I can see you.

2066
01:34:08,184 --> 01:34:09,852
You comfortable?

2067
01:34:09,894 --> 01:34:12,271
Yes, thank you.

2068
01:34:12,271 --> 01:34:14,273
So am I.

2069
01:34:14,273 --> 01:34:16,859
I'm as comfortable as a cow.

2070
01:34:19,195 --> 01:34:20,863
Say, Laura,

2071
01:34:20,905 --> 01:34:23,157
would you care
for a stick of chewing gum?

2072
01:34:23,199 --> 01:34:25,284
No, thank you.

2073
01:34:25,326 --> 01:34:27,244
Well,

2074
01:34:27,286 --> 01:34:29,955
I believe I will indulge.

2075
01:34:33,793 --> 01:34:36,295
Say,
just imagine the fortune made

2076
01:34:36,337 --> 01:34:39,965
by the guy that invented
the first piece of chewing gum.

2077
01:34:40,007 --> 01:34:42,259
Amazing, huh?

2078
01:34:42,301 --> 01:34:44,887
You know that

2079
01:34:44,887 --> 01:34:47,932
The Wrigley building
is one of the sights of Chicago?

2080
01:34:47,973 --> 01:34:51,102
I saw it the summer before last
at the century of progress.

2081
01:34:51,102 --> 01:34:53,437
Did you take in
the century of progress?

2082
01:34:53,479 --> 01:34:55,314
No, I didn't.

2083
01:34:55,314 --> 01:34:58,984
Well, it was a wonderful
exposition, believe me.

2084
01:34:59,026 --> 01:35:01,112
You know what
impressed me the most?

2085
01:35:01,153 --> 01:35:03,072
The hall of science.

2086
01:35:03,114 --> 01:35:05,032
It gives you an idea

2087
01:35:05,074 --> 01:35:07,368
of what the future will be like
in America.

2088
01:35:07,410 --> 01:35:09,412
Oh,
and it's a lot more wonderful

2089
01:35:09,453 --> 01:35:11,414
than the present time is.

2090
01:35:11,455 --> 01:35:14,417
Hmm.

2091
01:35:14,417 --> 01:35:16,001
Say, Laura.

2092
01:35:16,043 --> 01:35:17,837
Your brother tells me
you're shy.

2093
01:35:17,878 --> 01:35:19,338
Is that right?

2094
01:35:19,380 --> 01:35:21,924
Um,

2095
01:35:21,966 --> 01:35:24,927
I don't know.

2096
01:35:24,927 --> 01:35:26,512
You know,

2097
01:35:26,554 --> 01:35:29,056
I judge you to be
an old-fashioned type of girl.

2098
01:35:29,098 --> 01:35:31,308
Oh, and I think
that's a wonderful type to be.

2099
01:35:31,308 --> 01:35:33,561
I hope you don't think
I'm being too personal.

2100
01:35:33,602 --> 01:35:35,354
Do you?

2101
01:35:35,396 --> 01:35:37,314
Mr. O'Connor,

2102
01:35:37,356 --> 01:35:40,860
I believe that I will have
a piece of chewing gum,

2103
01:35:40,860 --> 01:35:42,361
if you don't mind.

2104
01:35:42,403 --> 01:35:44,321
Oh.

2105
01:35:51,954 --> 01:35:53,914
Mr. O'Connor,

2106
01:35:53,956 --> 01:35:57,042
Have you kept up
with your singing?

2107
01:35:57,084 --> 01:35:59,628
Singing?
Me?

2108
01:35:59,628 --> 01:36:02,006
Yes.

2109
01:36:02,006 --> 01:36:05,551
I remember
what a beautiful voice you had.

2110
01:36:05,593 --> 01:36:07,344
You heard me sing?

2111
01:36:07,386 --> 01:36:09,221
Oh, yes.

2112
01:36:09,263 --> 01:36:11,015
Very often.

2113
01:36:11,056 --> 01:36:14,268
I don't suppose
that you remember me at all.

2114
01:36:14,310 --> 01:36:16,187
You know,
as a matter of fact,

2115
01:36:16,187 --> 01:36:18,397
I did think I'd seen you
somewhere before.

2116
01:36:18,439 --> 01:36:20,065
You know, it was almost like

2117
01:36:20,107 --> 01:36:21,901
I was about
to remember your name,

2118
01:36:21,942 --> 01:36:24,570
but the name I was about
to remember wasn't a name,

2119
01:36:24,570 --> 01:36:26,614
so I stopped myself
before I said it.

2120
01:36:29,116 --> 01:36:32,953
Wasn't it blue roses?

2121
01:36:32,953 --> 01:36:34,330
Oh, my gosh.

2122
01:36:34,371 --> 01:36:35,956
Yes.

2123
01:36:35,998 --> 01:36:37,166
Blue roses.

2124
01:36:37,166 --> 01:36:40,211
I didn't connect you with
high school somehow or other,

2125
01:36:40,252 --> 01:36:41,629
but that's where it was.

2126
01:36:41,670 --> 01:36:44,381
It was high school,
huh?

2127
01:36:44,381 --> 01:36:46,592
I didn't know
you were Shakespeare's sister.

2128
01:36:46,634 --> 01:36:48,344
Gee, I'm sorry.

2129
01:36:48,344 --> 01:36:51,096
Oh, no.
That's all right.

2130
01:36:51,138 --> 01:36:52,515
I didn't expect you to.

2131
01:36:52,556 --> 01:36:54,225
We barely knew
each other.

2132
01:36:54,266 --> 01:36:56,310
Yeah, but we did have
a speaking acquaintance.

2133
01:36:56,352 --> 01:36:59,271
Yes, we spoke to each other.

2134
01:36:59,271 --> 01:37:01,524
Didn't we have a class
in something or other together?

2135
01:37:01,565 --> 01:37:03,609
Yes, we did.

2136
01:37:03,609 --> 01:37:05,194
What class was that?

2137
01:37:05,236 --> 01:37:08,072
It was singing.

2138
01:37:08,113 --> 01:37:10,533
Chorus.

2139
01:37:10,574 --> 01:37:13,077
I sat across the aisle
from you

2140
01:37:13,118 --> 01:37:16,038
in the auditorium

2141
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:19,083
Mondays, Wednesdays
and Fridays.

2142
01:37:19,124 --> 01:37:20,501
Oh.

2143
01:37:20,543 --> 01:37:22,127
I remember you now.

2144
01:37:22,169 --> 01:37:24,421
You're the girl that used to
always come in late.

2145
01:37:27,299 --> 01:37:29,218
Yes.

2146
01:37:31,262 --> 01:37:35,099
Well, I had that brace
on my leg back then.

2147
01:37:35,099 --> 01:37:38,435
It was so hard for me
getting up the stairs.

2148
01:37:38,477 --> 01:37:40,312
It clumped so loud.

2149
01:37:40,354 --> 01:37:42,314
JIM:
I never heard

2150
01:37:42,356 --> 01:37:44,316
Any clumping.

2151
01:37:44,358 --> 01:37:46,569
LAURA:
To me it sounded like thunder.

2152
01:37:46,610 --> 01:37:48,612
JIM:
I never even noticed.

2153
01:37:48,654 --> 01:37:51,699
LAURA:
Everybody was seated
when I came in the room.

2154
01:37:51,740 --> 01:37:54,285
I had to walk in front
of all those people.

2155
01:37:54,326 --> 01:37:56,328
My seat was in the back row.

2156
01:37:56,370 --> 01:37:58,372
I had to go
clumping up the aisle

2157
01:37:58,414 --> 01:38:00,374
with everybody watching.

2158
01:38:00,416 --> 01:38:03,419
JIM:
Oh, you shouldn't
have been self-conscious.

2159
01:38:03,460 --> 01:38:05,462
I know.

2160
01:38:05,504 --> 01:38:08,716
But I was.

2161
01:38:08,757 --> 01:38:10,634
Yeah.

2162
01:38:10,676 --> 01:38:12,511
I remember you now.

2163
01:38:12,553 --> 01:38:15,514
I used to call you
blue roses.

2164
01:38:15,556 --> 01:38:17,391
Well, I hope you didn't mind.

2165
01:38:17,433 --> 01:38:19,226
LAURA:
Oh, no.

2166
01:38:19,268 --> 01:38:21,145
I liked it.

2167
01:38:21,186 --> 01:38:24,398
You see, I wasn't acquainted
with many people.

2168
01:38:24,440 --> 01:38:27,359
I remember you kind of
always stuck by yourself.

2169
01:38:27,401 --> 01:38:31,405
Well,
I never had very much luck

2170
01:38:31,405 --> 01:38:35,034
making friends.

2171
01:38:35,075 --> 01:38:36,493
I don't know
why you wouldn't.

2172
01:38:36,535 --> 01:38:39,705
Well, I started out badly.

2173
01:38:39,747 --> 01:38:41,290
You mean being a--

2174
01:38:41,332 --> 01:38:43,208
Yes, well,

2175
01:38:43,250 --> 01:38:45,127
it always, um,

2176
01:38:45,127 --> 01:38:48,714
stood between me
and other people.

2177
01:38:48,756 --> 01:38:50,341
Now,
you shouldn't have let it.

2178
01:38:50,341 --> 01:38:51,717
I know.

2179
01:38:51,759 --> 01:38:53,385
But I did.

2180
01:38:53,427 --> 01:38:56,263
So you were shy with people.

2181
01:38:56,305 --> 01:38:59,516
Well, I tried not to be,
but I never could--

2182
01:38:59,516 --> 01:39:01,101
JIM:
Overcome it?

2183
01:39:01,143 --> 01:39:03,729
No, I never could.

2184
01:39:03,729 --> 01:39:05,314
Yeah.

2185
01:39:05,356 --> 01:39:07,566
I guess being shy
is one of those things

2186
01:39:07,566 --> 01:39:10,736
you kind of have
to work out of gradually.

2187
01:39:10,778 --> 01:39:13,197
I guess that it takes...

2188
01:39:13,238 --> 01:39:14,782
Time.

2189
01:39:14,823 --> 01:39:17,451
Time.

2190
01:39:20,663 --> 01:39:22,665
Say.

2191
01:39:22,665 --> 01:39:25,125
You know something,
Laura?

2192
01:39:25,167 --> 01:39:28,545
People aren't so dreadful
when you get to know them.

2193
01:39:28,587 --> 01:39:31,256
That's what
you have to remember.

2194
01:39:31,298 --> 01:39:34,301
And everybody has problems,
not just you.

2195
01:39:34,343 --> 01:39:37,221
Practically everybody
has problems.

2196
01:39:37,262 --> 01:39:39,431
See, you think of yourself

2197
01:39:39,473 --> 01:39:41,392
as being
the only one who's disappointed.

2198
01:39:41,392 --> 01:39:43,268
Well, you look around you
a little bit.

2199
01:39:43,310 --> 01:39:45,062
What do you see?

2200
01:39:45,062 --> 01:39:47,481
A lot of people
just as disappointed as you are.

2201
01:39:47,523 --> 01:39:49,608
You take me, for instance.

2202
01:39:49,650 --> 01:39:52,444
Laura,
when I graduated high school,

2203
01:39:52,444 --> 01:39:54,154
I sure thought

2204
01:39:54,196 --> 01:39:56,490
I'd be a lot further along
than I am now.

2205
01:39:56,532 --> 01:40:00,494
You remember that wonderful
write-up I had in The Torch?

2206
01:40:00,536 --> 01:40:02,663
LAURA:
Yes, I do.

2207
01:40:02,663 --> 01:40:06,667
JIM:
Remember it said
that I was bound to succeed

2208
01:40:06,709 --> 01:40:08,794
in anything that I wanted to?

2209
01:40:08,836 --> 01:40:11,171
What's that?

2210
01:40:11,213 --> 01:40:13,132
Oh.

2211
01:40:13,173 --> 01:40:15,759
LAURA:
Here you are inThe Pirates of Penzance.

2212
01:40:15,801 --> 01:40:18,178
JIM:
Oh, my.

2213
01:40:18,220 --> 01:40:21,098
The Pirates.

2214
01:40:21,140 --> 01:40:22,808

2215
01:40:22,850 --> 01:40:25,853

2220
01:40:34,820 --> 01:40:36,780
I sang lead in that operetta.

2221
01:40:36,822 --> 01:40:38,782
LAURA:
So beautifully.

2222
01:40:38,824 --> 01:40:40,367
JIM:
Oh.

2223
01:40:40,409 --> 01:40:41,827
LAURA:
Oh, yes, beautifully.

2224
01:40:41,869 --> 01:40:43,412
Beautifully.

2225
01:40:43,454 --> 01:40:45,122
JIM:
You heard me, then, huh?

2226
01:40:45,164 --> 01:40:46,749
LAURA:
I heard you all three times.

2227
01:40:46,790 --> 01:40:48,375
JIM:
No.

2228
01:40:48,417 --> 01:40:49,752
LAURA:
Yes.

2229
01:40:49,793 --> 01:40:52,171
JIM:
You mean you saw
all three performances?

2230
01:40:52,212 --> 01:40:53,589
LAURA:
Yes.

2231
01:40:53,630 --> 01:40:54,798
JIM:
What for?

2232
01:40:54,840 --> 01:40:57,760
LAURA:
Well, I wanted to ask you
to autograph my program.

2233
01:40:57,801 --> 01:40:59,595
JIM:
So, why didn't you ask me?

2234
01:40:59,595 --> 01:41:03,140
LAURA:
Well, you were always surrounded
by your own friends--

2235
01:41:03,140 --> 01:41:06,143
JIM:
You should have just
come right up and said,

2236
01:41:06,143 --> 01:41:07,644
"Hey, here's my program."

2237
01:41:07,686 --> 01:41:10,397
LAURA:
I thought that
you might think that I was--

2238
01:41:10,439 --> 01:41:12,524
JIM:
Thought I might think
you was what?

2239
01:41:12,566 --> 01:41:14,359
LAURA:
Oh, um...

2240
01:41:14,359 --> 01:41:16,695
JIM:
Oh, oh.

2241
01:41:16,737 --> 01:41:20,282
Yeah, I was beleaguered
by females in those days.

2242
01:41:20,324 --> 01:41:23,327
LAURA:
You were terribly popular.

2243
01:41:23,368 --> 01:41:25,162
JIM:
Yeah.

2244
01:41:25,204 --> 01:41:26,914
LAURA:
You had such a friendly way.

2245
01:41:26,955 --> 01:41:29,792
JIM:
Oh, I was spoiled
in high school.

2246
01:41:29,833 --> 01:41:32,211
LAURA:
Everybody liked you.

2247
01:41:32,252 --> 01:41:34,546
JIM:
Including you?

2248
01:41:34,588 --> 01:41:36,965
LAURA:
Yes.

2249
01:41:37,007 --> 01:41:40,677
Yes, I did too.

2250
01:41:40,719 --> 01:41:42,721
JIM:
Well,

2251
01:41:42,763 --> 01:41:45,474
hand me that program,
Laura.

2252
01:41:54,900 --> 01:41:56,485
There you are.

2253
01:41:56,527 --> 01:41:58,237
Better late than never.

2254
01:41:58,278 --> 01:42:00,405
LAURA:
Oh, my.

2255
01:42:00,447 --> 01:42:02,741
What a surprise.

2256
01:42:02,783 --> 01:42:06,495
JIM:
Well, my signature's not worth
very much right now,

2257
01:42:06,537 --> 01:42:09,373
but maybe some day
it will increase in value.

2258
01:42:09,414 --> 01:42:11,917
You know,
being disappointed is one thing;

2259
01:42:11,959 --> 01:42:14,837
being discouraged
is something else.

2260
01:42:14,837 --> 01:42:18,382
Well, I may be disappointed,
but I am not discouraged.

2261
01:42:20,467 --> 01:42:22,386
So.

2262
01:42:22,427 --> 01:42:24,930
You finished high school.

2263
01:42:24,972 --> 01:42:28,433
LAURA:
Well, I got bad grades
on my final examinations.

2264
01:42:28,475 --> 01:42:30,602
JIM:
You mean you dropped out?

2265
01:42:30,644 --> 01:42:33,272
LAURA:
I didn't go back.

2266
01:42:48,328 --> 01:42:51,290
How's Emily Meisenbach
getting along?

2267
01:42:51,331 --> 01:42:53,834
That krauthead.

2268
01:42:55,711 --> 01:42:57,838
Why do you call her that?

2269
01:42:57,880 --> 01:43:00,966
That's what she was.

2270
01:43:01,008 --> 01:43:03,886
You mean
you're not still going together?

2271
01:43:03,927 --> 01:43:06,430
Oh, I never even see her.

2272
01:43:06,430 --> 01:43:08,599
I read
in the personal section

2273
01:43:08,640 --> 01:43:11,268
that you were engaged.

2274
01:43:11,268 --> 01:43:12,644
Yeah.

2275
01:43:12,686 --> 01:43:14,730
Well, I was not impressed
by that propaganda.

2276
01:43:14,771 --> 01:43:16,732
Then it wasn't the truth?

2277
01:43:16,773 --> 01:43:18,317
Oh,

2278
01:43:18,358 --> 01:43:21,528
it was only true
in Emily's optimistic opinion.

2279
01:43:28,785 --> 01:43:32,748
So, what have you been doing
since high school?

2280
01:43:32,789 --> 01:43:35,709
Nothing much.

2281
01:43:35,751 --> 01:43:37,836
Must have been doing something.

2282
01:43:37,878 --> 01:43:39,838
Yes.

2283
01:43:39,880 --> 01:43:41,757
Well, then,
such as what?

2284
01:43:41,798 --> 01:43:43,800
I took
a business course

2285
01:43:43,842 --> 01:43:46,345
in business college.

2286
01:43:46,386 --> 01:43:47,971
You did?
How did that go?

2287
01:43:48,013 --> 01:43:49,681
Not very well.
I had to drop out.

2288
01:43:49,723 --> 01:43:51,308
It gave me indigestion.

2289
01:43:51,350 --> 01:43:52,893
Oh.

2290
01:43:52,935 --> 01:43:54,561
Yeah.

2291
01:43:54,603 --> 01:43:57,856
So, what are you doing now?

2292
01:43:57,898 --> 01:43:59,650
Well,

2293
01:43:59,691 --> 01:44:02,069
I don't do anything much.

2294
01:44:02,110 --> 01:44:03,862
Oh,
please don't think

2295
01:44:03,904 --> 01:44:06,907
that I just sit around
doing nothing.

2296
01:44:08,825 --> 01:44:11,578
My glass collection
takes a good deal of time.

2297
01:44:11,620 --> 01:44:13,455
Glass is something that

2298
01:44:13,455 --> 01:44:15,457
you have
to take very good care of.

2299
01:44:15,457 --> 01:44:16,833
I'm sorry.

2300
01:44:16,875 --> 01:44:18,585
What did you say about glass?

2301
01:44:18,627 --> 01:44:21,546
Collection.
I said that I have one.

2302
01:44:21,588 --> 01:44:22,965
Laura,

2303
01:44:23,006 --> 01:44:26,426
you know what I judge
to be the trouble with you?

2304
01:44:26,468 --> 01:44:28,595
Inferiority complex.

2305
01:44:28,637 --> 01:44:30,013
You know what that is?

2306
01:44:30,013 --> 01:44:32,849
That's what they call it
when a fellow low rates himself.

2307
01:44:32,849 --> 01:44:35,811
Oh, I understand it
because I had it too.

2308
01:44:35,852 --> 01:44:37,396
Uh-huh.

2309
01:44:37,437 --> 01:44:40,899
Only my case was not as
aggravated as yours seems to be.

2310
01:44:40,941 --> 01:44:43,443
I had it

2311
01:44:43,485 --> 01:44:45,696
until I took--

2312
01:44:49,032 --> 01:44:52,995
I had it until I took a course
in public speaking.

2313
01:44:53,036 --> 01:44:54,746
I developed my voice

2314
01:44:54,788 --> 01:44:58,000
and I learned that
I had an aptitude for science.

2315
01:44:58,041 --> 01:45:00,127
You know, until that time,

2316
01:45:00,168 --> 01:45:03,046
I never thought of myself
as being outstanding

2317
01:45:03,046 --> 01:45:05,048
in any way whatsoever.

2318
01:45:05,048 --> 01:45:08,093
Now, I've never made
a regular study of this,

2319
01:45:08,135 --> 01:45:09,678
mind you,

2320
01:45:09,720 --> 01:45:12,055
but I have a friend
who says I can analyze people

2321
01:45:12,055 --> 01:45:14,891
better than doctors
who make a profession of it.

2322
01:45:14,933 --> 01:45:17,102
I don't claim
it's necessarily true,

2323
01:45:17,144 --> 01:45:19,479
but I can sure guess
a person's psychology.

2324
01:45:19,521 --> 01:45:21,148
Excuse me, Laura.

2325
01:45:21,189 --> 01:45:24,609
I always take it out
when the flavor's gone.

2326
01:45:24,609 --> 01:45:27,654
I'll just wrap it up here
in a piece of newspaper.

2327
01:45:27,696 --> 01:45:29,614
I know what it's like

2328
01:45:29,656 --> 01:45:31,867
when you get it
stuck on your shoe.

2329
01:45:31,908 --> 01:45:33,493
Yeah.

2330
01:45:33,493 --> 01:45:35,162
That is what I judge

2331
01:45:35,162 --> 01:45:36,747
to be
your principal trouble:

2332
01:45:36,788 --> 01:45:39,708
lack of confidence in yourself
as a person.

2333
01:45:39,708 --> 01:45:43,003
Now, I'm basing that fact
on a number of your remarks

2334
01:45:43,045 --> 01:45:45,589
and on certain observations
I've made.

2335
01:45:45,630 --> 01:45:47,716
For instance,

2336
01:45:47,758 --> 01:45:51,470
you know that clumping you say
was so awful in high school?

2337
01:45:51,511 --> 01:45:53,847
You say you dreaded
going up stairs.

2338
01:45:53,889 --> 01:45:55,974
You see what you did?

2339
01:45:56,016 --> 01:45:58,435
Hmm?

2340
01:45:58,435 --> 01:46:00,604
You dropped out of school.

2341
01:46:00,604 --> 01:46:03,815
You gave up an education
all over a little clump,

2342
01:46:03,815 --> 01:46:07,652
which, as far as I can see,
is practically non-existent.

2343
01:46:07,652 --> 01:46:09,863
Oh.

2344
01:46:09,905 --> 01:46:12,616
A little physical defect
is all you have.

2345
01:46:12,657 --> 01:46:14,785
Hardly noticeable, even,

2346
01:46:14,826 --> 01:46:17,746
magnified 1,000 times
by your imagination.

2347
01:46:17,788 --> 01:46:19,915
My strong advice to you:

2348
01:46:19,956 --> 01:46:22,709
you've got
to start thinking of yourself

2349
01:46:22,751 --> 01:46:24,961
as superior in some way.

2350
01:46:25,003 --> 01:46:28,507
LAURA:
In what way would I think?

2351
01:46:28,548 --> 01:46:30,675
JIM:
Oh.

2352
01:46:30,717 --> 01:46:32,886
Oh, man alive.

2353
01:46:32,928 --> 01:46:35,138
Laura,
look around you a little.

2354
01:46:35,138 --> 01:46:37,474
Hmm?

2355
01:46:37,516 --> 01:46:39,726
What do you see, huh?

2356
01:46:39,768 --> 01:46:42,104
A whole world
full of common people,

2357
01:46:42,145 --> 01:46:44,898
all of them born,
all of them going to die.

2358
01:46:44,940 --> 01:46:48,193
Now, which of them has
1/10 of your strong points?

2359
01:46:48,193 --> 01:46:50,612
Or mine, hmm?

2360
01:46:50,654 --> 01:46:53,240
Or anybody else's,
for that matter?

2361
01:46:53,240 --> 01:46:55,492
You see,

2362
01:46:55,534 --> 01:46:57,744
everybody excels
in some one thing,

2363
01:46:57,744 --> 01:46:59,788
some in many.

2364
01:46:59,830 --> 01:47:01,915
Take me, for instance.

2365
01:47:01,957 --> 01:47:05,085
Now, my interest happens to lie
in electrodynamics.

2366
01:47:05,127 --> 01:47:07,754
I'm taking a course
in radio engineering

2367
01:47:07,796 --> 01:47:10,507
on top of
a fairly responsible job

2368
01:47:10,549 --> 01:47:11,967
in the warehouse.

2369
01:47:11,967 --> 01:47:14,594
I'm taking that course
and I'm studying

2370
01:47:14,636 --> 01:47:16,513
public speaking

2371
01:47:16,513 --> 01:47:20,058
because I believe
in the future of television.

2372
01:47:22,102 --> 01:47:24,229
I want to be ready
to go right on up with it.

2373
01:47:24,271 --> 01:47:26,106
See,

2374
01:47:26,148 --> 01:47:28,733
I'm planning on getting in
on the ground floor.

2375
01:47:28,775 --> 01:47:31,153
I've already made
all the right connections.

2376
01:47:31,194 --> 01:47:33,029
The only thing
that remains now

2377
01:47:33,071 --> 01:47:36,867
is for the industry itself
to get underway full steam.

2378
01:47:36,908 --> 01:47:39,619
You know, knowledge.

2379
01:47:39,619 --> 01:47:40,996
Zip.

2380
01:47:41,037 --> 01:47:42,622
Money.

2381
01:47:42,664 --> 01:47:43,999
Zip.

2382
01:47:44,040 --> 01:47:45,625
Power.

2383
01:47:45,667 --> 01:47:48,044
Wham!

2384
01:47:48,086 --> 01:47:51,047
It's the cycle
that democracy's built on.

2385
01:47:54,301 --> 01:47:58,013
You must think
I think an awful lot of myself.

2386
01:47:58,013 --> 01:47:59,890
Oh, no, I don't.

2387
01:47:59,890 --> 01:48:01,892
Okay.

2388
01:48:01,933 --> 01:48:04,019
Okay.

2389
01:48:04,060 --> 01:48:06,021
Now,

2390
01:48:06,062 --> 01:48:08,106
How about you?

2391
01:48:08,148 --> 01:48:11,735
There must be some one thing
you take more interest in

2392
01:48:11,776 --> 01:48:13,862
than anything else in the world.

2393
01:48:13,904 --> 01:48:16,323
LAURA:
Yes.

2394
01:48:16,364 --> 01:48:19,075
Well,
such as what?

2395
01:48:19,117 --> 01:48:22,746
Well, I do, as I said,
have my glass collection.

2396
01:48:22,787 --> 01:48:24,789
JIM:
You do, huh?

2397
01:48:24,831 --> 01:48:26,583
What kind of glass is that?

2398
01:48:28,376 --> 01:48:31,630
Little articles of it.

2399
01:48:31,671 --> 01:48:34,758
Ornaments, mostly.

2400
01:48:34,758 --> 01:48:37,802
Most of them
are little animals

2401
01:48:37,844 --> 01:48:40,889
made out of glass --

2402
01:48:40,931 --> 01:48:44,768
The tiniest little animals
in the world.

2403
01:48:44,768 --> 01:48:48,647
My mother calls them
my glass menagerie.

2404
01:49:05,080 --> 01:49:07,666
Here's an example of one,

2405
01:49:07,707 --> 01:49:10,168
if you'd like
to see it.

2406
01:49:15,131 --> 01:49:17,342
This is one of the oldest.

2407
01:49:17,384 --> 01:49:19,761
He's nearly 13.

2408
01:49:19,761 --> 01:49:21,972
Oh, be careful.

2409
01:49:22,013 --> 01:49:23,974
If you breathe,
it breaks.

2410
01:49:23,974 --> 01:49:26,309
JIM:
Oh, I better not take him,
then.

2411
01:49:26,309 --> 01:49:27,978
I'm kind of clumsy with things.

2412
01:49:27,978 --> 01:49:29,646
LAURA:
Oh, no.

2413
01:49:29,688 --> 01:49:31,648
I trust you with it.

2414
01:49:34,109 --> 01:49:36,778
There.

2415
01:49:36,820 --> 01:49:40,365
You're holding him gently.

2416
01:49:40,407 --> 01:49:43,785
Hold him up
in the light.

2417
01:49:53,086 --> 01:49:56,673
He just loves light.

2418
01:49:56,715 --> 01:49:58,842
See how the light

2419
01:49:58,842 --> 01:50:01,761
just shines
through him?

2420
01:50:01,803 --> 01:50:03,888
Yeah.

2421
01:50:03,930 --> 01:50:05,932
He sure does shine.

2422
01:50:05,974 --> 01:50:09,060
LAURA:
I shouldn't be partial,

2423
01:50:09,102 --> 01:50:11,855
but he's my favorite one.

2424
01:50:11,896 --> 01:50:15,317
What kind of animal
is this supposed to be?

2425
01:50:15,358 --> 01:50:18,903
Haven't you noticed
the single horn on his forehead?

2426
01:50:18,945 --> 01:50:21,114
A unicorn, huh?

2427
01:50:21,156 --> 01:50:22,949
Uh-huh.

2428
01:50:22,949 --> 01:50:24,784
A unicorn.

2429
01:50:24,784 --> 01:50:27,454
Aren't they supposed to be
extinct in the modern world?

2430
01:50:27,495 --> 01:50:29,080
I know.

2431
01:50:29,122 --> 01:50:31,291
Poor little fellow.

2432
01:50:33,918 --> 01:50:36,087
Must feel kind of lonesome.

2433
01:50:36,129 --> 01:50:39,299
Well, if he does,
he doesn't complain about it.

2434
01:50:39,341 --> 01:50:41,718
He stays on the shelf

2435
01:50:41,760 --> 01:50:45,055
with all the other horses
that don't have horns.

2436
01:50:45,096 --> 01:50:47,891
They seem
to get along nicely together.

2437
01:50:47,932 --> 01:50:49,309
How do you know?

2438
01:50:51,144 --> 01:50:52,854
LAURA:
Well,

2439
01:50:52,896 --> 01:50:55,774
I haven't heard
any arguments.

2440
01:50:55,815 --> 01:50:57,484
No arguments, huh?

2441
01:50:57,525 --> 01:51:00,445
Well,
that's a good sign.

2442
01:51:03,490 --> 01:51:06,201
Where will I put him?

2443
01:51:06,242 --> 01:51:08,119
Oh,

2444
01:51:08,161 --> 01:51:10,955
you can put him
anywhere.

2445
01:51:10,997 --> 01:51:13,041
They all like
a change of scenery

2446
01:51:13,083 --> 01:51:15,460
every once in a while.

2447
01:51:15,502 --> 01:51:17,462
JIM:
They do.

2448
01:51:19,881 --> 01:51:21,466
Oh.

2449
01:51:21,508 --> 01:51:23,259
Hey.

2450
01:51:23,301 --> 01:51:26,471
Look how big my shadow is
when I stretch.

2451
01:51:26,513 --> 01:51:28,431
LAURA:
Oh.

2452
01:51:28,431 --> 01:51:30,225
Oh, my,
yes.

2453
01:51:30,266 --> 01:51:33,895
It stretches
clear across the ceiling.

2454
01:51:33,937 --> 01:51:36,147
(jazz instrumental)

2455
01:51:38,149 --> 01:51:40,819
Where's the music coming from?

2456
01:51:40,860 --> 01:51:43,488
LAURA:
It comes
from the Paradise Dance Hall

2457
01:51:43,530 --> 01:51:45,365
across the alley.

2458
01:51:45,365 --> 01:51:49,160
♪♪

2459
01:51:49,202 --> 01:51:53,123
Say, how about
cutting a rug a little,

2460
01:51:53,164 --> 01:51:55,583
Miss Wingfield?

2461
01:51:55,583 --> 01:51:58,086
Or is your program
all filled up?

2462
01:51:58,128 --> 01:52:00,296
Let me have a look at it there.

2463
01:52:02,549 --> 01:52:04,134
Oh.

2464
01:52:04,134 --> 01:52:05,760
Every dance is taken.

2465
01:52:05,802 --> 01:52:08,179
Well, I'll just have
to scratch some of them out.

2466
01:52:09,973 --> 01:52:11,474
A waltz.

2467
01:52:11,474 --> 01:52:14,394
I can't dance.

2468
01:52:14,436 --> 01:52:16,354
There you go
with that inferiority stuff.

2469
01:52:16,354 --> 01:52:18,815
No.
I never danced in my life.

2470
01:52:18,857 --> 01:52:20,358
JIM:
Come on.
Try.

2471
01:52:20,358 --> 01:52:22,485
LAURA:
I'm afraid
that I would step on you.

2472
01:52:22,527 --> 01:52:24,988
Well, I'm not made out of glass.

2473
01:52:27,073 --> 01:52:29,075
How do I start?

2474
01:52:29,117 --> 01:52:32,287
Hold your arms out a little.

2475
01:52:35,623 --> 01:52:37,292
Like this?

2476
01:52:37,292 --> 01:52:38,960
A little higher.

2477
01:52:45,967 --> 01:52:47,343
All right, Laura.

2478
01:52:47,385 --> 01:52:48,970
Now, don't tighten up.

2479
01:52:49,012 --> 01:52:51,014
That's the principal thing
about it.

2480
01:52:51,014 --> 01:52:52,849
Just relax.

2481
01:52:52,849 --> 01:52:55,935
I'm afraid
that you can't budge me.

2482
01:52:55,977 --> 01:52:58,229
Well, you bet I can.

2483
01:53:04,444 --> 01:53:06,946
My goodness.

2484
01:53:08,990 --> 01:53:11,242
Yes, you can.

2485
01:53:11,284 --> 01:53:13,036
JIM:
Okay.

2486
01:53:13,077 --> 01:53:14,621
Let yourself go,
Laura.

2487
01:53:14,662 --> 01:53:16,456
Just let yourself go.

2488
01:53:16,498 --> 01:53:18,500
LAURA:
I'm trying.

2489
01:53:18,541 --> 01:53:20,335
JIM:
Not so stiff, now.

2490
01:53:20,335 --> 01:53:22,253
Easy does it.

2491
01:53:22,295 --> 01:53:24,589
There you go.

2492
01:53:24,631 --> 01:53:26,925
LAURA:
Oh, my.

2493
01:53:26,966 --> 01:53:28,885
Oh, my.

2494
01:53:30,470 --> 01:53:33,223
Oh, my goodness.

2495
01:53:35,058 --> 01:53:37,227
JIM:
That's it.

2496
01:53:37,227 --> 01:53:39,395
You're doing it now,
Laura.

2497
01:53:39,395 --> 01:53:42,232
LAURA:
I am.

2498
01:53:42,273 --> 01:53:44,609
There we go.

2499
01:53:44,609 --> 01:53:47,111
That's better.

2500
01:53:47,111 --> 01:53:49,531
LAURA:
Oh.

2501
01:53:49,572 --> 01:53:51,991
JIM:
That's it, Laura.

2502
01:53:53,952 --> 01:53:55,995
Now we're doing it.

2503
01:53:56,037 --> 01:53:58,540
LAURA:
I am.

2504
01:53:58,540 --> 01:54:01,042
I am.

2505
01:54:01,042 --> 01:54:03,002
(clattering)

2506
01:54:08,341 --> 01:54:11,469
JIM:
Is it broken?

2507
01:54:18,601 --> 01:54:21,646
LAURA:
Now he's just like
all the other horses.

2508
01:54:21,688 --> 01:54:23,940
JIM:
What do you mean?

2509
01:54:23,982 --> 01:54:25,483
He lost his--

2510
01:54:25,525 --> 01:54:28,069
LAURA:
He lost his horn.

2511
01:54:28,111 --> 01:54:30,572
It doesn't matter.

2512
01:54:33,324 --> 01:54:36,327
Maybe
it's a blessing in disguise.

2513
01:54:36,369 --> 01:54:38,246
JIM:
I bet you'll never forgive me.

2514
01:54:38,246 --> 01:54:40,540
That was
your favorite piece of glass.

2515
01:54:40,582 --> 01:54:43,251
LAURA:
I don't have favorites much.

2516
01:54:43,251 --> 01:54:45,628
It's no tragedy.

2517
01:54:45,670 --> 01:54:47,630
Glass breaks so easily

2518
01:54:47,672 --> 01:54:50,008
no matter
how careful you are.

2519
01:54:50,049 --> 01:54:52,635
The traffic jars the shelves
and things fall off.

2520
01:54:52,677 --> 01:54:54,429
JIM:
Still,

2521
01:54:54,429 --> 01:54:57,348
I'm awful sorry
that I was the cause of it.

2522
01:55:00,059 --> 01:55:04,022
LAURA:
I'll just imagine
that he had an operation,

2523
01:55:04,063 --> 01:55:06,691
and the horn was removed

2524
01:55:06,691 --> 01:55:10,528
to make him feel
less freakish.

2525
01:55:10,528 --> 01:55:12,530
But now

2526
01:55:12,572 --> 01:55:15,575
he'll feel more at home
with the other horses.

2527
01:55:15,617 --> 01:55:18,494
Well, I'm glad to see
that you have a sense of humor.

2528
01:55:18,536 --> 01:55:21,289
You know,

2529
01:55:21,289 --> 01:55:24,125
You're different
than anybody I know.

2530
01:55:24,167 --> 01:55:25,543
Do you mind me saying that?

2531
01:55:25,585 --> 01:55:27,170
I mean it.

2532
01:55:27,211 --> 01:55:28,671
You make me feel sort of--

2533
01:55:28,671 --> 01:55:31,132
I don't know
how to say this.

2534
01:55:31,174 --> 01:55:34,302
I'm usually pretty good
at expressing things.

2535
01:55:34,302 --> 01:55:37,180
This is something
I don't know how to say.

2536
01:55:39,432 --> 01:55:42,352
Did anybody ever tell you
that you were pretty?

2537
01:55:42,352 --> 01:55:44,395
You are,

2538
01:55:44,437 --> 01:55:47,106
and in a different way
than anybody else,

2539
01:55:47,148 --> 01:55:49,776
and all the nicer
because of the difference.

2540
01:55:49,817 --> 01:55:51,778
Oh, I wish you were my sister.

2541
01:55:51,819 --> 01:55:54,614
I'd teach you
to have confidence in yourself,

2542
01:55:54,656 --> 01:55:57,784
because being different
is nothing to be ashamed of,

2543
01:55:57,825 --> 01:56:01,162
because other people
aren't such wonderful people.

2544
01:56:01,204 --> 01:56:03,206
They're 100 times 1,000.

2545
01:56:03,247 --> 01:56:05,249
You,

2546
01:56:05,291 --> 01:56:08,336
you're one times one.

2547
01:56:08,378 --> 01:56:11,089
They wander
all over the earth.

2548
01:56:11,130 --> 01:56:13,675
You just stay right here.

2549
01:56:13,675 --> 01:56:16,344
Why,
they're as common as weeds.

2550
01:56:16,386 --> 01:56:19,097
But you, you're blue roses.

2551
01:56:19,138 --> 01:56:21,724
Blue is
wrong for roses.

2552
01:56:21,724 --> 01:56:23,768
But it's right for you.

2553
01:56:25,812 --> 01:56:27,605
You're pretty.

2554
01:56:27,605 --> 01:56:31,150
In what respect
am I pretty?

2555
01:56:31,192 --> 01:56:33,444
Why,
in all respects.

2556
01:56:33,486 --> 01:56:36,823
Your eyes, your hair,
your hands are pretty.

2557
01:56:36,823 --> 01:56:38,616
Do you think
I'm saying this

2558
01:56:38,658 --> 01:56:40,284
just because
I was invited to supper

2559
01:56:40,326 --> 01:56:41,661
and I have to be nice?

2560
01:56:41,703 --> 01:56:42,870
Oh,
I could do that.

2561
01:56:42,912 --> 01:56:45,707
I could tell you all kinds
of things without being sincere.

2562
01:56:45,707 --> 01:56:47,291
But I'm talking
to you sincerely.

2563
01:56:47,333 --> 01:56:49,627
I happened to notice

2564
01:56:49,669 --> 01:56:52,171
You have
this inferiority complex

2565
01:56:52,213 --> 01:56:55,550
that keeps you from being
comfortable with people.

2566
01:56:55,550 --> 01:56:58,553
Somebody ought
to build your confidence up.

2567
01:56:58,553 --> 01:57:00,763
Way up.

2568
01:57:00,805 --> 01:57:03,224
Somebody ought to make you proud

2569
01:57:03,266 --> 01:57:06,352
instead of shy
and turning away and blushing.

2570
01:57:06,394 --> 01:57:08,646
Somebody ought to...

2571
01:57:12,483 --> 01:57:15,695
JIM:
Somebody ought
to kiss you, Laura.

2572
01:57:55,276 --> 01:57:57,361
(creaking)

2573
01:58:04,619 --> 01:58:06,913
I shouldn't have done that.

2574
01:58:06,954 --> 01:58:09,290
That was
way off the beam.

2575
01:58:11,292 --> 01:58:13,836
Would you care for a cigarette?

2576
01:58:15,671 --> 01:58:18,174
You don't smoke,
do you?

2577
01:58:18,216 --> 01:58:19,675
How about a mint?

2578
01:58:19,717 --> 01:58:21,427
Peppermint lifesaver.

2579
01:58:21,469 --> 01:58:23,846
Look, my pocket's
a regular drugstore.

2580
01:58:23,846 --> 01:58:25,765
Here.

2581
01:58:33,564 --> 01:58:35,399
Laura,
if I had a sister like you,

2582
01:58:35,399 --> 01:58:37,276
I'd do the same as Tom.

2583
01:58:37,318 --> 01:58:39,487
I'd invite fellows home here
to meet you.

2584
01:58:39,529 --> 01:58:41,697
Well, maybe
I shouldn't be saying that.

2585
01:58:41,739 --> 01:58:44,534
That might not have been
the idea in having me over.

2586
01:58:44,575 --> 01:58:46,452
Well, what if it was?

2587
01:58:46,452 --> 01:58:48,579
Now,
there's nothing wrong with that.

2588
01:58:48,621 --> 01:58:50,665
It's just that...

2589
01:58:54,377 --> 01:58:55,336
in my case,

2590
01:58:55,378 --> 01:59:01,634
I'm not in a position
to do the right thing.

2591
01:59:03,845 --> 01:59:07,807
I can't ask you for your number
and say that I'll phone.

2592
01:59:10,351 --> 01:59:14,605
I can't call you
and ask you for a date.

2593
01:59:14,605 --> 01:59:15,606
Well,

2594
01:59:15,606 --> 01:59:17,608
I just thought
I'd better explain the situation

2595
01:59:17,608 --> 01:59:21,320
in case you misunderstood
and I hurt your feelings.

2596
01:59:21,362 --> 01:59:23,990
You won't call again?

2597
01:59:24,031 --> 01:59:26,742
No.

2598
01:59:29,620 --> 01:59:32,623
I can't, Laura.

2599
01:59:32,665 --> 01:59:35,459
I've got strings on me.

2600
01:59:35,501 --> 01:59:37,837
You see,
I've been going steady.

2601
01:59:37,879 --> 01:59:42,008
I go out all the time
with a girl named Betty.

2602
01:59:42,049 --> 01:59:44,719
Oh, and, uh,

2603
01:59:44,760 --> 01:59:46,846
she's a nice,
quiet home girl,

2604
01:59:46,888 --> 01:59:49,432
just like you.

2605
01:59:49,432 --> 01:59:51,767
She's Catholic
and she's Irish,

2606
01:59:51,767 --> 01:59:54,937
so we get along fine.

2607
01:59:54,979 --> 01:59:56,689
I met her
last summer

2608
01:59:56,731 --> 01:59:57,648
on a moonlight boat trip

2609
01:59:57,690 --> 02:00:02,486
up the River to Alton
on the Majestic.

2610
02:00:02,486 --> 02:00:07,033
And right away from the start
it was love.

2611
02:00:07,033 --> 02:00:08,618
Oh, boy.

2612
02:00:08,659 --> 02:00:11,871
And being in love
has made a new man out of me.

2613
02:00:11,871 --> 02:00:13,748
The power of love is tremendous.

2614
02:00:13,748 --> 02:00:14,749
It's the kind of thing

2615
02:00:14,790 --> 02:00:19,337
that just changes
the whole world.

2616
02:00:19,378 --> 02:00:21,339
Well, uh,

2617
02:00:21,380 --> 02:00:22,632
Betty's aunt took sick

2618
02:00:22,673 --> 02:00:25,593
and she got a wire
and had to go to Centralia.

2619
02:00:25,635 --> 02:00:28,262
So, naturally,
when Tom invited me for dinner,

2620
02:00:28,304 --> 02:00:32,725
I accepted the invitation,
not knowing--

2621
02:00:32,767 --> 02:00:36,312
Well, I mean, um,

2622
02:00:36,354 --> 02:00:41,609
not knowing.

2623
02:00:41,651 --> 02:00:44,612
I wish you would say something.

2624
02:01:04,006 --> 02:01:05,758
What are you doing?

2625
02:01:05,800 --> 02:01:07,385
You want me
to have it?

2626
02:01:18,938 --> 02:01:21,065
What for?

2627
02:01:22,733 --> 02:01:26,570
Souvenir.

2628
02:01:26,570 --> 02:01:27,947
AMANDA:
Children,

2629
02:01:27,989 --> 02:01:30,616
I'm coming.

2630
02:01:30,658 --> 02:01:32,952
I'm coming.

2631
02:01:32,952 --> 02:01:35,538
I'm coming.

2632
02:01:35,579 --> 02:01:38,833
I thought you all might like
a little liquid refreshment.

2633
02:01:38,833 --> 02:01:40,042
Honey.

2634
02:01:40,084 --> 02:01:42,878
Mr. O'Connor.

2635
02:01:42,920 --> 02:01:46,632
Mr. O'Connor, have you heard
that song about lemonade?

2636
02:01:46,674 --> 02:01:48,592
Hmm?

2637
02:01:48,634 --> 02:01:50,886
♪♪ Lemonade

2638
02:01:50,928 --> 02:01:53,431
♪♪ Lemonade

2639
02:01:53,472 --> 02:01:56,517
♪♪ Made in the shade

JIM:
Mo, ma'am.

2642
02:02:04,025 --> 02:02:07,111
I never heard that one.

2643
02:02:07,111 --> 02:02:09,488
AMANDA:
Honey,
why are you looking so serious?

2644
02:02:09,530 --> 02:02:12,950
JIM:
Well, we were just having
a serious conversation.

2645
02:02:12,992 --> 02:02:14,535
(sighing)

2646
02:02:14,577 --> 02:02:17,788
AMANDA:
I don't understand
you modern young people.

2647
02:02:17,830 --> 02:02:20,875
When I was a girl,
I was just gay about everything.

2648
02:02:20,875 --> 02:02:23,878
JIM:
You haven't changed a bit,
Mrs. Wingfield.

2649
02:02:23,878 --> 02:02:26,881
AMANDA:
Well, I suppose
it's the gaiety of the occasion

2650
02:02:26,922 --> 02:02:28,841
That has rejuvenated me,

2651
02:02:28,883 --> 02:02:33,637
so here is to
the gaiety of the occasion.

2652
02:02:33,679 --> 02:02:34,638
Mm!

2653
02:02:36,682 --> 02:02:39,602
I baptized myself.

2654
02:02:41,687 --> 02:02:44,815
Oh, I found some cherries
back there in the kitchen,

2655
02:02:44,857 --> 02:02:47,651
and I put one
at the bottom of each glass.

2656
02:02:47,693 --> 02:02:50,488
You shouldn't have gone
to all that trouble, ma'am.

2657
02:02:50,529 --> 02:02:51,697
AMANDA:
It wasn't any trouble at all.

2658
02:02:51,697 --> 02:02:54,033
Didn't you hear us cutting up
out there in the kitchen?

2659
02:02:54,033 --> 02:02:55,868
I was so outdone with Tom

2660
02:02:55,868 --> 02:02:57,119
for not bringing
you over sooner.

2661
02:02:57,161 --> 02:03:00,915
And now that you know the way,
I want you to come all the time.

2662
02:03:00,956 --> 02:03:03,834
Not just once in a while,
but all the time.

2663
02:03:03,876 --> 02:03:05,211
I'm going to run on back
to the kitchen.

2664
02:03:05,252 --> 02:03:06,796
JIM:
Oh, no, no, ma'am.

2665
02:03:06,837 --> 02:03:08,798
Look, as a matter of fact,
well,

2666
02:03:08,839 --> 02:03:10,216
I have to be going.

2667
02:03:10,257 --> 02:03:12,051
Oh,
but Mr. O'Connor,

2668
02:03:12,093 --> 02:03:14,595
It's only
the shank of the evening.

2669
02:03:14,637 --> 02:03:16,180
Well, you know how it is,
ma'am.

2670
02:03:16,222 --> 02:03:17,515
AMANDA:
You mean because

2671
02:03:17,556 --> 02:03:19,183
you are a young working man

2672
02:03:19,225 --> 02:03:20,810
and you have
to keep working men's hours.

2673
02:03:20,851 --> 02:03:22,061
Yes, ma'am.

2674
02:03:22,103 --> 02:03:24,480
AMANDA:
We'll let you off early
this time,

2675
02:03:24,522 --> 02:03:27,775
but only on the condition
that you stay later next time.

2676
02:03:27,817 --> 02:03:28,943
Much, much later.

2677
02:03:28,984 --> 02:03:30,027
What's the best evening for you?

2678
02:03:30,027 --> 02:03:31,821
Is it Saturday?

2679
02:03:31,862 --> 02:03:33,948
JIM:
Well, as a matter of fact,
Mrs. Wingfield,

2680
02:03:33,989 --> 02:03:37,118
I have a couple of time clocks
that I have to punch.

2681
02:03:37,159 --> 02:03:39,495
One in the morning
and another one at night.

2682
02:03:39,537 --> 02:03:40,913
Oh, you are so ambitious.

2683
02:03:40,955 --> 02:03:42,581
You work nights too?

2684
02:03:42,623 --> 02:03:44,708
Well, no, ma'am.

2685
02:03:44,750 --> 02:03:47,044
Uh, not work,

2686
02:03:47,086 --> 02:03:49,839
But, uh, Betty.

2687
02:03:49,839 --> 02:03:52,633
Betty?

2688
02:03:52,675 --> 02:03:53,634
Who's Betty?

2689
02:03:53,676 --> 02:03:56,095
She's just a girl,

2690
02:03:56,137 --> 02:03:59,890
a girl I go steady with.

2691
02:03:59,932 --> 02:04:02,184
Is it serious?

2692
02:04:02,226 --> 02:04:03,978
Yes, ma'am,
it is.

2693
02:04:04,019 --> 02:04:07,982
Well, we're going to be married
the second Sunday in June.

2694
02:04:11,152 --> 02:04:12,903
Tom didn't say anything at all

2695
02:04:12,945 --> 02:04:15,823
about your being engaged
to be married.

2696
02:04:15,865 --> 02:04:17,616
Well, uh,
the cat's not out of the bag

2697
02:04:17,658 --> 02:04:18,951
down at the warehouse yet,
ma'am.

2698
02:04:18,951 --> 02:04:20,536
You know how it is.

2699
02:04:20,578 --> 02:04:23,664
The fellows call you Romeo
and stuff like that.

2700
02:04:23,706 --> 02:04:24,999
Mrs. Wingfield,

2701
02:04:25,040 --> 02:04:26,750
it's been a wonderful evening.

2702
02:04:26,792 --> 02:04:29,712
This must be what they mean
by Southern hospitality.

2703
02:04:29,753 --> 02:04:31,297
Oh.

2704
02:04:31,338 --> 02:04:34,133
Nothing at all,
nothing at all.

2705
02:04:38,012 --> 02:04:39,889
JIM:
Well, I hope
that you ladies don't think

2706
02:04:39,930 --> 02:04:42,016
that I'm rushing off,
but I--

2707
02:04:42,057 --> 02:04:45,019
Well, I promised Betty i'd
pick her up at the Wabash depot.

2708
02:04:45,060 --> 02:04:47,021
By the time I get my jalopy
down to the train,

2709
02:04:47,062 --> 02:04:48,606
she's going to be in.

2710
02:04:48,647 --> 02:04:51,066
You know how
some women get pretty upset

2711
02:04:51,108 --> 02:04:52,693
when you keep them waiting.

2712
02:04:52,735 --> 02:04:57,698
I know all about
the tyranny of women.

2713
02:04:57,740 --> 02:05:00,159
Goodbye, Mr. O'Connor.

2714
02:05:06,790 --> 02:05:10,669
And I want
to wish you happiness

2715
02:05:10,711 --> 02:05:14,965
and good fortune.

2716
02:05:15,007 --> 02:05:17,218
And you wish him that too,
don't you, Laura?

2717
02:05:17,259 --> 02:05:19,970
Yes, mother,
I do.

2718
02:05:24,225 --> 02:05:27,603
Well, uh,
bye, Laura.

2719
02:05:29,980 --> 02:05:32,316
I'll always treasure
this souvenir.

2720
02:05:40,866 --> 02:05:42,034
Oh, uh,

2721
02:05:42,076 --> 02:05:44,662
Bye, Shakespeare.

2722
02:05:44,703 --> 02:05:47,081
Well, thank you again,
ladies.

2723
02:05:47,081 --> 02:05:49,667
And, uh, good night.

2724
02:05:49,708 --> 02:05:51,377
Laura,

2725
02:05:51,418 --> 02:05:55,130
Don't you forget
that good advice I gave you.

2726
02:06:04,974 --> 02:06:07,184
(sighing)

2727
02:06:10,980 --> 02:06:14,149
Well, well, well.

2728
02:06:16,443 --> 02:06:20,155
Things have a way
of turning out so badly.

2729
02:06:32,293 --> 02:06:33,836
Oh, Laura.

2730
02:06:33,877 --> 02:06:35,713
I wouldn't play
that Victrola anymore,

2731
02:06:35,754 --> 02:06:38,173
would you?

2732
02:06:41,844 --> 02:06:44,138
(sighing)

2733
02:06:44,138 --> 02:06:46,849
Well, well, well.

2734
02:06:48,851 --> 02:06:52,855
So, our gentleman caller
was engaged to be married.

2735
02:06:52,896 --> 02:06:55,024
(Victrola whirring)

2736
02:07:00,070 --> 02:07:02,781
Tom!

2737
02:07:02,781 --> 02:07:04,783
TOM:
Yes, mother?

2738
02:07:04,783 --> 02:07:05,993
AMANDA:
Come on out here.

2739
02:07:06,035 --> 02:07:08,454
I want to tell you
something very funny.

2740
02:07:14,001 --> 02:07:16,962
Has the gentleman caller
gone away already?

2741
02:07:17,004 --> 02:07:18,756
Yes.

2742
02:07:18,797 --> 02:07:20,424
He made
a very early departure,

2743
02:07:20,466 --> 02:07:23,761
and that was a funny joke
you played on us too.

2744
02:07:23,802 --> 02:07:26,221
How do you mean?

2745
02:07:26,221 --> 02:07:26,930
You didn't tell us

2746
02:07:26,972 --> 02:07:29,224
he was engaged
to be married.

2747
02:07:29,266 --> 02:07:31,060
Jim?

2748
02:07:31,101 --> 02:07:32,394
Engaged?

2749
02:07:32,394 --> 02:07:35,064
Well,
that's what he just informed us.

2750
02:07:35,105 --> 02:07:36,940
Well,
I'll be jiggered.

2751
02:07:36,982 --> 02:07:38,901
I didn't know that.

2752
02:07:38,942 --> 02:07:42,029
Well,
that seems very peculiar to me.

2753
02:07:42,071 --> 02:07:45,240
What's peculiar about it?

2754
02:07:45,282 --> 02:07:47,826
Didn't you tell me
he was your best friend

2755
02:07:47,868 --> 02:07:49,828
down at the warehouse?

2756
02:07:49,870 --> 02:07:52,039
Mother, he is,
but how did I know?

2757
02:07:52,039 --> 02:07:54,041
Well,
it seems very peculiar to me

2758
02:07:54,083 --> 02:07:56,752
that you didn't know
that your best friend

2759
02:07:56,794 --> 02:07:58,337
was engaged to be married.

2760
02:07:58,379 --> 02:08:00,756
Mother,
the warehouse is where I work,

2761
02:08:00,798 --> 02:08:02,925
not where I know things
about people.

2762
02:08:02,966 --> 02:08:05,135
You don't know things anywhere.

2763
02:08:05,177 --> 02:08:07,346
You live
in a dream world.

2764
02:08:07,388 --> 02:08:09,932
You just manufacture illusions.

2765
02:08:09,932 --> 02:08:13,143
Where are you going?
Where are you going?

2766
02:08:13,185 --> 02:08:14,853
I'm going to the movies.

2767
02:08:14,895 --> 02:08:16,480
Oh, that's right.

2768
02:08:16,480 --> 02:08:19,775
Now that you have had us
make such fools of ourselves.

2769
02:08:19,817 --> 02:08:22,277
Well, all the effort
and all the preparation

2770
02:08:22,319 --> 02:08:23,904
and all the expense.

2771
02:08:23,946 --> 02:08:26,240
The new rug and the floor lamp
and the clothes for Laura.

2772
02:08:26,281 --> 02:08:27,157
And for what?

2773
02:08:27,199 --> 02:08:30,452
To entertain
some other girl's fiancé?

2774
02:08:30,494 --> 02:08:32,913
Oh, go on
and go to the movies.

2775
02:08:32,913 --> 02:08:34,206
Don't think about us:

2776
02:08:34,248 --> 02:08:36,125
A mother who is deserted,

2777
02:08:36,166 --> 02:08:39,294
an unmarried sister
who is crippled and has no job.

2778
02:08:39,336 --> 02:08:42,923
No, don't let anything interfere
with your selfish pleasures.

2779
02:08:42,965 --> 02:08:44,550
Just go on
and go to the movies.

2780
02:08:44,633 --> 02:08:46,218
All right.

2781
02:08:46,260 --> 02:08:47,928
I will.

2782
02:08:47,928 --> 02:08:49,304
The more you shout

2783
02:08:49,346 --> 02:08:51,306
about my selfishness
to me,

2784
02:08:51,348 --> 02:08:53,350
the quicker I will go.

2785
02:08:53,392 --> 02:08:55,561
And I won't go to the movies,
either.

2786
02:08:55,602 --> 02:08:57,563
AMANDA:
Go!

2787
02:08:57,604 --> 02:08:58,397
Go, go!

2788
02:08:58,439 --> 02:09:02,276
Go to the moon,
you selfish dreamer!

2789
02:09:15,372 --> 02:09:19,126
(background music:
solemn instrumental)

2790
02:09:19,168 --> 02:09:23,630
♪♪

2791
02:09:23,672 --> 02:09:26,425
VOICE OF TOM:I didn't go to the moon;

2792
02:09:26,425 --> 02:09:28,343
I went much further.

2793
02:09:28,385 --> 02:09:31,597
For time
is the longest distance

2794
02:09:31,638 --> 02:09:34,349
between two places.

2795
02:09:36,477 --> 02:09:40,063
Not long after that,
I left St. Louis.

2796
02:09:40,063 --> 02:09:42,900
I descended the steps

2797
02:09:42,941 --> 02:09:45,986
of our fire escape
for a last time,

2798
02:09:46,028 --> 02:09:48,197
and from then on

2799
02:09:48,238 --> 02:09:51,909
I followed
in my father's footsteps,

2800
02:09:51,950 --> 02:09:55,329
attempting
to find in motion

2801
02:09:55,370 --> 02:09:59,208
what was lost in space.

2802
02:09:59,249 --> 02:10:02,336
I travelled around
a great deal.

2803
02:10:02,336 --> 02:10:06,465
The city swept about me
like dead leaves,

2804
02:10:06,507 --> 02:10:08,634
leaves
that were brightly colored

2805
02:10:08,675 --> 02:10:12,012
but torn away from the branches.

2806
02:10:12,054 --> 02:10:15,307
I would have stopped,

2807
02:10:15,349 --> 02:10:18,352
but I was pursued
by something.

2808
02:10:18,393 --> 02:10:21,063
It always came upon me unawares,

2809
02:10:21,104 --> 02:10:25,442
taking me altogether
by surprise.

2810
02:10:25,442 --> 02:10:29,321
Perhaps it was
a familiar bit of music.

2811
02:10:29,363 --> 02:10:30,989
Perhaps it was only

2812
02:10:31,031 --> 02:10:34,493
a piece
of transparent glass.

2813
02:10:34,493 --> 02:10:38,163
Perhaps I'm walking
along the street at night

2814
02:10:38,205 --> 02:10:40,624
in some strange city

2815
02:10:40,666 --> 02:10:43,460
before
I have found companions.

2816
02:10:43,502 --> 02:10:46,713
I pass
the lighted window of a shop

2817
02:10:46,755 --> 02:10:49,424
where perfume is sold.

2818
02:10:49,424 --> 02:10:51,301
The window is filled

2819
02:10:51,343 --> 02:10:54,429
with pieces
of colored glass,

2820
02:10:54,471 --> 02:10:57,641
tiny transparent bottles

2821
02:10:57,683 --> 02:10:59,977
in delicate colors

2822
02:11:00,018 --> 02:11:04,648
like bits
of a shattered rainbow.

2823
02:11:04,648 --> 02:11:07,484
Then, all at once,

2824
02:11:07,484 --> 02:11:10,612
my sister touches
my shoulder.

2825
02:11:10,654 --> 02:11:14,283
I turn around
and look into her eyes.

2826
02:11:26,753 --> 02:11:30,382
Laura?

2827
02:11:30,424 --> 02:11:32,467
Laura?

2828
02:11:39,016 --> 02:11:41,977
I tried so hard

2829
02:11:42,019 --> 02:11:45,063
to leave you
behind me,

2830
02:11:45,105 --> 02:11:48,400
but I am more faithful

2831
02:11:48,442 --> 02:11:52,070
than I intended
to be.

2832
02:11:52,112 --> 02:11:54,072
I reach
for a cigarette.

2833
02:11:54,114 --> 02:11:56,074
I cross the street.

2834
02:11:56,116 --> 02:11:58,410
I run into the movies
or a bar.

2835
02:11:58,410 --> 02:12:01,455
I buy a drink.

2836
02:12:01,496 --> 02:12:04,458
I speak
to the nearest stranger --

2837
02:12:04,458 --> 02:12:08,295
anything
that will blow your candles out.

2838
02:12:12,799 --> 02:12:16,178
For nowadays

2839
02:12:16,219 --> 02:12:20,182
the world
is lit by lightning.

2840
02:12:25,354 --> 02:12:28,398
Blow out your candles,
Laura.

2841
02:12:41,244 --> 02:12:43,497
And so...
