1
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:35,260
Action, Jake.

2
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:43,026
Cut.
Look, what's the problem here?

3
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:47,938
Remember, I want you to open the coffin
a beat after you open your eyes.

4
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:50,475
Get him out of here!
Come on! Raise the camera!

5
00:01:50,543 --> 00:01:52,272
Joe, give me a hand.
Something's the matter with him.

6
00:01:52,345 --> 00:01:54,779
That's all right, Jake.
Just relax.

7
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:57,783
We got you. Something's going on.
Something's weird.

8
00:01:57,851 --> 00:02:00,285
- Are you okay, babe?
- Give him some air.

9
00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:03,345
What's the matter? Speak to me.
Come on, talk.

10
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:05,448
What's the matter?

11
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:08,961
I don't know.
I don't know what happened.

12
00:02:09,028 --> 00:02:12,464
I was in the coffin. I closed my eyes.
I thought everything would be okay.

13
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:15,023
I opened my eyes, and the camera
was right on top of me...

14
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:17,797
and I couldn't move.

15
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:19,964
It's no big thing.
I just...

16
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:23,133
For a second there,
I just couldn't move.

17
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:25,302
I don't know what happened.
I'm sorry.

18
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:27,141
Fire!

19
00:02:27,213 --> 00:02:29,147
No! What happened?

20
00:02:29,215 --> 00:02:32,981
Get up there!
Put some water on it!

21
00:02:35,722 --> 00:02:38,316
This is great.
That's terrific.

22
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:39,824
You got it under control?

23
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:46,498
Look, Jake,
you really look exhausted, babe.

24
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:50,332
Why don't you take a shower
and go on home. We lost the sun.

25
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:52,667
Let me try it one more time.
I can do it.

26
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:56,402
I know you can,
but we don't have any sun anymore.

27
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:33,537
Can I have nuts with that
and a Manhattan?

28
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:35,046
- Yeah.
- And fries.

29
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:36,547
- Right.
- Rings.

30
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:40,211
- Anything to drink?
- Two large Cokes with ice.

31
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:43,380
Onions on everything.

32
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:45,549
- That to go?
- Yeah.

33
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,889
4.99.

34
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:49,394
Keep the change.

35
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:52,556
You too.
See you guys.

36
00:06:00,593 --> 00:06:04,859
- Scully, how's that picture coming?
- Good. Fine.

37
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:08,025
- Great.
- I'll have a Jack Daniels, neat.

38
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:11,195
Are you serious?
You quit drinking. Remember?

39
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:13,204
Just get the drink, Doug.

40
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:16,370
What's the matter?

41
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:18,535
They cut your big scene?

42
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:28,619
Again.

43
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,669
Carol?

44
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:50,442
I thought you were a bartender,
not a priest.

45
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:53,639
That's right.
I'm a bartender.

46
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:56,113
Then keep the fucking glass filled.

47
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:01,086
Keep your own glass filled.

48
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:06,751
- I'm sorry.
- That's cool.

49
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:09,420
Just don't pay any attention to me.

50
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:10,928
l...

51
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:18,502
You need a place to stay?

52
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:22,440
Yeah, I guess I do.

53
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:57,631
What are you doing here?
I thought you were working.

54
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:59,637
I am. I got a week off.

55
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:02,037
I figured I'd go
to some interviews, stay busy.

56
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:06,204
- Great.
- Do you know about any sublets?

57
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:09,043
- I'II check around.
- Something available immediately.

58
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:12,209
- Not offhand.
- What... Ho!

59
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:15,049
The whole world's here.
You two know each other?

60
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:17,885
- Jake Scully, Sam Bouchard.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

61
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:20,391
- Right here.
- I'll see you in class later.

62
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:23,053
- We got class today?
- At 3:00.

63
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:25,597
- Right.
- Good luck.

64
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:27,895
What have you been doing lately?

65
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:31,733
I just started a low-budget,
independent horror film.

66
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:34,568
'Vampire's Kiss."
I play the vampire.

67
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:38,739
Sounds interesting.

68
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:41,905
Before that I did Petruchio
in 'Taming of the Shrew."

69
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:43,744
Anything else?

70
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:47,911
You mean anything good?

71
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:49,750
You are working.

72
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:54,316
- That's good now, isn't it?
- Yeah.

73
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:10,108
- Hi. Small town.
- Yeah.

74
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:12,940
- Jack Scully.
- Jake.

75
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:14,445
Give them hell.

76
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:18,616
Hello.

77
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:36,701
I remember that it was dark.

78
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:39,970
Really black.

79
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:43,634
I was just a little kid.

80
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:47,645
And the wall behind me was cold.

81
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,807
And damp.

82
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:52,646
I was hiding. I was...

83
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:54,481
Oh, yeah.

84
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:56,646
I was part of this game: Sardine.

85
00:10:56,722 --> 00:10:59,316
I was it, and I was hiding.

86
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:02,987
Everybody was looking for me.

87
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:06,498
And there was humming.

88
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:08,829
I was behind the freezer
in the basement.

89
00:11:11,904 --> 00:11:16,000
And I had jammed myself in
so hard behind the freezer...

90
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:18,908
that I couldn't move.

91
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:25,008
I'm afraid.

92
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:29,020
Uh-huh.
What are you afraid of?

93
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:32,790
They're not gonna find me.

94
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:36,328
But they're not supposed
to find you.

95
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:38,989
But I'm afraid
because I can't move.

96
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:42,694
Why don't you cry out?

97
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:47,030
I can't. I'm afraid.

98
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:52,540
Besides, I'm the sardine.
They're not supposed to find me.

99
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:55,375
Now particularize that.

100
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:56,881
Who can't find you?

101
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:59,975
My brothers.
They're bigger than me.

102
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:04,218
First time
they ever let me play.

103
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:06,554
If they're your brothers,
they'll want to help you, right?

104
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:09,560
No. They won't let me play again.

105
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:12,688
- They're bigger than you are.
- Yeah.

106
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:15,893
Will they hurt you?

107
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:17,401
Yes.

108
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,734
How?

109
00:12:19,805 --> 00:12:22,069
They'll laugh at me for getting stuck
behind the freezer...

110
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:23,631
and for crying out for help.

111
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:27,741
The big baby.

112
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:29,246
That's right.

113
00:12:30,983 --> 00:12:33,417
You are a baby.

114
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,253
I know.

115
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:40,258
Yeah, and you're afraid.

116
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:41,759
Yeah.

117
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,264
You must act.

118
00:12:52,838 --> 00:12:55,272
I can't. I'm afraid.

119
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:57,536
- You'll never escape.
- I know.

120
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:00,444
You'll die.

121
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,113
Yeah.

122
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,614
Bullshit!

123
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:08,619
You've got to act!

124
00:13:09,855 --> 00:13:11,322
Fuck the fear.

125
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:15,960
You've got to cry out for help!
Come on!

126
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:17,962
Use your body!
Cry for help!

127
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,832
You can do it.

128
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:27,737
I want you to cry out.

129
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,297
I can't. I'm a sardine.

130
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:32,366
Sardines in a can are dead.

131
00:13:32,444 --> 00:13:34,639
They can't feel.
They can't be afraid.

132
00:13:34,713 --> 00:13:37,341
But you're alive and afraid.

133
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:39,475
You're not a goddamn dead sardine!

134
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:42,487
- This is crap.
- Dig down deep!

135
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,223
Cry out!

136
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:54,028
- I can't.
- Come on.

137
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:55,896
Leave the guy alone.

138
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:58,936
Do not interrupt this exercise.

139
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:01,905
This looks like
a mind-fuck to me.

140
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:05,171
What is your name? You're not
a member of this class, are you?

141
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:08,412
That's right. I'm not.

142
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,176
I thought this was a class for acting,
not humiliation.

143
00:14:13,752 --> 00:14:17,449
What gives you the right
to fuck around with this guy's head?

144
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:23,856
- I think you better leave.
- I think that's a good idea.

145
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:27,025
I want to act.
Come on.

146
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:31,092
Class is out.
Come on. Let's go.

147
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:32,603
I'm sorry, Will.

148
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:35,105
I can't do this today.

149
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:39,440
This is called an exit.

150
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:46,283
Shit.

151
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:50,781
What a fool I am.

152
00:14:51,857 --> 00:14:54,951
You're too hard on yourself.

153
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:58,292
Some of these guys
can't get a job.

154
00:14:58,364 --> 00:15:00,958
They put an ad in the trade.
They call themselves teachers.

155
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:05,629
What do they teach us?
How to be more fucked up than we are.

156
00:15:05,704 --> 00:15:07,137
That's not it.

157
00:15:13,712 --> 00:15:16,078
- Can we get another round?
- Coming up.

158
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:25,289
- Thanks.
- Check.

159
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:27,291
Are you married?

160
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:32,663
Separated.

161
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:36,599
Me too, as of yesterday.

162
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:41,663
We weren't married,
but it was almost the same thing.

163
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,173
What happened?

164
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:48,172
I'm sorry.
That's none of my business.

165
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:50,181
That's okay.
It's just...

166
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,346
Sounds so stupid.

167
00:15:55,754 --> 00:15:57,517
These things usually do.

168
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:02,454
Caught her in bed
with another guy.

169
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:04,086
Can you believe that?

170
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:05,596
Man.

171
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:08,189
You had no idea?

172
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:13,504
None.

173
00:16:15,774 --> 00:16:17,708
Christ, I keep seeing it.

174
00:16:21,613 --> 00:16:23,376
Carol lying there.

175
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:28,381
Her face was glowing.

176
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:34,991
- Her face was glowing?
- Yeah.

177
00:16:36,061 --> 00:16:38,996
How do you get
a girl's face to glow?

178
00:16:39,064 --> 00:16:40,554
I got 16 years of good humping.

179
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:45,069
Not once did I get a glimmer,
let alone a fucking glow.

180
00:16:45,137 --> 00:16:46,570
Glowing?

181
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:53,241
- I'm sorry. That's tough.
- No, you're right.

182
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:55,576
It's not that big a deal, really.

183
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:58,241
- You kicked the bitch out I hope.
- I didn't.

184
00:16:58,317 --> 00:17:00,911
- Why not?
- It was her place.

185
00:17:08,994 --> 00:17:11,087
You've been through the shitter.

186
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:16,434
- Where are you staying?
- I got a friend with a floor.

187
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:26,777
You ready for some good news?

188
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:28,938
Yeah.

189
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:31,107
I got this five-week gig coming up.

190
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:33,447
Seattle Rep's doing a revival
of 'Private Lives."

191
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:35,612
I've been house-sitting
for a friend.

192
00:17:35,687 --> 00:17:39,282
- He gives me a good deal on the place...
- I've been looking for a sublet.

193
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:42,293
- Would this be available right away?
- Wait here.

194
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:45,125
Let me make a phone call.
Don't move.

195
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:51,461
- Do you like plants?
- Sure.

196
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:59,705
- I can't believe this.
- It's something, isn't it?

197
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:06,150
Be if ever so humble.

198
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:11,083
- This is unbelievable.
- I know it's not much.

199
00:18:11,156 --> 00:18:14,319
- Can you handle this?
- I've never seen anything like it.

200
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:17,328
- Your friend must really be loaded.
- He's filthy with the stuff.

201
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:21,833
Anyway, here they are.
Water them every day after 6:00.

202
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,993
- Right.
- You got it?

203
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:27,505
- That's it.
- Listen, this is really nice of you.

204
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:30,838
No thanks necessary.
One struggling actor helping another.

205
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:32,672
- That's what it's all about.
- Thank you.

206
00:18:32,744 --> 00:18:35,679
- Just don't let the damn plants die.
- You got it.

207
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:38,511
- Where is he anyway?
- Alan?

208
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:40,848
- Yeah.
- He spends a lot of time in Europe.

209
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:43,353
I got a well-stocked bar.

210
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:45,515
- Rotating bed.
- "Rotating"?

211
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:49,527
Sauna and Jacuzzi in the back
just beyond the walk-in closets.

212
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:51,961
As soon as I pack up,
you can put your stuff away.

213
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:54,521
- Are you leaving now?
- Yeah, l...

214
00:18:57,603 --> 00:19:00,367
The hell with it.
I got time for one more drink.

215
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:03,203
I'll still be able
to catch the last flight.

216
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:07,378
What a setup.
This is great.

217
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:08,879
Isn't it?

218
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:14,552
Thank you.

219
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,054
- Sam, here's to a friendship...
- Wait.

220
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:21,725
Let's do this right.
Come here.

221
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:29,399
To Hollywood.

222
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:30,901
Yeah.

223
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,903
What a view.

224
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:41,238
That's just part of it.

225
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:46,250
There is one very special feature
to this house.

226
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,413
- What are you looking at?
- Where are you?

227
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,560
There she is.

228
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:00,931
Show time.

229
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:09,098
I'd like you to meet
my favorite neighbor.

230
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:15,679
- See her?
- Whoa.

231
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:20,784
It gets better.

232
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:26,790
- What's she doing?
- Just keep watching. You'll see.

233
00:20:26,858 --> 00:20:29,656
- You want to get a little closer?
- You bet.

234
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:32,458
- Oh, my God.
- Focused?

235
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:37,059
- She's a little out of focus. Yes!
- Yes? Hang on.

236
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:41,138
Does she do this a lot?

237
00:20:41,206 --> 00:20:43,299
Like clockwork, every night.

238
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:30,347
Jesus.

239
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,473
What do you think?

240
00:23:34,546 --> 00:23:36,673
- It's something, isn't it?
- Yeah.

241
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:38,807
Lady does the same gig every night.

242
00:23:38,884 --> 00:23:41,478
Did you get a look at her face?

243
00:23:41,553 --> 00:23:44,920
Too bad. She is gorgeous.
Shit.

244
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:47,151
- I gotta get going.
- Can I help you?

245
00:23:47,225 --> 00:23:48,658
All right.

246
00:23:48,727 --> 00:23:50,490
Don't forget your scarf.

247
00:23:52,397 --> 00:23:53,989
Here's the key.

248
00:23:54,065 --> 00:23:56,499
Try not to make too many
long-distance phone calls.

249
00:23:56,568 --> 00:23:58,331
Thanks again.
This is good of you.

250
00:23:58,403 --> 00:24:00,166
- You're doing me a favor too.
- Thank you.

251
00:24:00,238 --> 00:24:03,173
- Take it easy.
- Knock 'em dead!

252
00:24:03,241 --> 00:24:05,675
They're already dead in Seattle.

253
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:07,177
So long.

254
00:24:15,187 --> 00:24:16,848
My, my

255
00:24:16,922 --> 00:24:18,355
Uh-oh

256
00:24:18,423 --> 00:24:22,189
The house is burning
but there's no one home

257
00:25:58,123 --> 00:25:59,556
Jesus!

258
00:26:10,302 --> 00:26:11,769
Bastard.

259
00:26:43,668 --> 00:26:46,603
Where the hell have you been?
I've been calling you all over town.

260
00:26:46,671 --> 00:26:49,936
I'm sorry, Frank. I've been having
some real problems with Carol.

261
00:26:50,008 --> 00:26:52,499
I've been staying
at a friend's house.

262
00:26:52,577 --> 00:26:55,444
You got a few more problems.
Rubin fired you.

263
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:58,675
- What?
- You dont have a job anymore.

264
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,775
He gave me some bullshit
about artistic differences.

265
00:27:00,852 --> 00:27:02,319
What the hell happened?

266
00:27:02,387 --> 00:27:05,151
Nothing.
How can he do that?

267
00:27:05,223 --> 00:27:06,850
They're doing it right now.

268
00:27:06,925 --> 00:27:10,383
Can't we do something?
Maybe I should talk to Rubin.

269
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:12,794
You better forget it.
They've already hired another guy.

270
00:27:12,864 --> 00:27:15,389
- How do you know?
- He's my client.

271
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:22,572
Now bring them up.

272
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:26,304
You're loving every minute of it,
sweetheart. It feels so good.

273
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:29,142
You're getting ready to take
a nice chunk out of the neck.

274
00:27:29,214 --> 00:27:31,808
Hands down. Good.

275
00:27:31,883 --> 00:27:33,817
All right, cut!

276
00:27:33,885 --> 00:27:35,477
Kill the water and steam.

277
00:27:35,553 --> 00:27:37,487
I thought you were gonna
give me another chance.

278
00:27:37,555 --> 00:27:41,491
Look, I got a picture to make here.
I got 25 days to make it.

279
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:45,154
I got no time to fuck around
with a claustrophobic vampire...

280
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:47,494
who freezes every time
he lies down in the coffin.

281
00:27:47,565 --> 00:27:50,659
- I'm not claustrophobic.
- Then what happened? Stage fright?

282
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:52,669
I don't know.
It never happened before.

283
00:27:52,737 --> 00:27:56,673
It's never gonna happen again.
Good-bye. I gotta get back to work.

284
00:27:56,741 --> 00:27:59,835
- You promised me another chance.
- I lied.

285
00:27:59,911 --> 00:28:01,674
- Don't you yell at me!
- Big fucking deal.

286
00:28:01,746 --> 00:28:03,509
- Get outta here! Beat it!
- Listen...

287
00:28:03,581 --> 00:28:07,847
Joe, get him outta here! You don't come
in here yelling at me on my set!

288
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,012
- You don't have the right to lie to me.
- There's the door.

289
00:28:10,922 --> 00:28:12,685
Go on! Get out!

290
00:28:12,757 --> 00:28:16,193
Get out the door, you fruitcake.
What's wrong with you?

291
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:17,728
- He's the boss.
- It's not fair.

292
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:21,789
What's everybody standing around for?
Let's get back to work. Come on.

293
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:48,926
Just like clockwork.

294
00:29:20,992 --> 00:29:22,425
There she goes.

295
00:32:01,819 --> 00:32:05,414
Excuse me.
Could you move, please? Please!

296
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:07,219
I gotta go.
Thank you.

297
00:32:50,868 --> 00:32:52,961
- Good morning, ma'am.
- Thank you.

298
00:33:03,214 --> 00:33:04,977
I have to see you.

299
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:07,813
What time did you call?

300
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:11,154
I'm never home till after 7:00.

301
00:33:13,224 --> 00:33:15,317
Yes, he hit me again.

302
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:22,825
I've got to talk to someone.

303
00:33:24,235 --> 00:33:25,668
Today.

304
00:33:27,238 --> 00:33:28,830
The Beach Terrace Motel?

305
00:33:29,907 --> 00:33:33,001
I'II wear something special.

306
00:33:33,077 --> 00:33:34,510
You'll see.

307
00:33:39,417 --> 00:33:41,442
Yeah. Okay.

308
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:42,952
Bye.

309
00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:14,230
- Security, please.
- This is security.

310
00:37:14,298 --> 00:37:17,233
Please come over to Bellini's.
I think we have a problem.

311
00:38:06,851 --> 00:38:08,443
Excuse me.

312
00:38:10,821 --> 00:38:13,790
- May I help you?
- No, thank you.

313
00:40:55,352 --> 00:40:56,785
Did you see that guy?

314
00:41:23,013 --> 00:41:25,106
- It's the cream Mercedes.
- Wait here, please.

315
00:42:08,893 --> 00:42:11,828
- Thank you. Here you are.
- Thank you, ma'am.

316
00:42:13,397 --> 00:42:15,831
- Can I have my car, please?
- Yes, sir.

317
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:18,528
Thank you.
Right away. As soon as possible.

318
00:42:20,304 --> 00:42:22,670
Straight toward the beach,
down the stairs.

319
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:24,173
Thank you.

320
00:45:42,272 --> 00:45:43,705
Hello?

321
00:45:48,512 --> 00:45:49,945
Yes.

322
00:45:51,782 --> 00:45:53,374
You've got to come.

323
00:45:55,552 --> 00:45:58,180
I need to talk to you.

324
00:45:58,255 --> 00:45:59,745
I've got to talk to someone.

325
00:46:04,294 --> 00:46:05,886
I need you.

326
00:47:07,524 --> 00:47:08,957
Excuse me.

327
00:47:10,294 --> 00:47:12,421
Someone's following you.

328
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:20,435
I know.

329
00:47:22,206 --> 00:47:23,798
No, it's not me.

330
00:51:10,434 --> 00:51:12,026
Are you all right?

331
00:51:12,102 --> 00:51:13,535
He got away.

332
00:51:14,438 --> 00:51:16,702
You got the purse.

333
00:51:16,773 --> 00:51:20,209
You better check it.
He took something.

334
00:51:22,112 --> 00:51:23,545
What's the matter?

335
00:51:25,782 --> 00:51:27,716
I'm just out of breath.

336
00:51:29,486 --> 00:51:33,047
Can you take me out of here?

337
00:51:33,123 --> 00:51:34,556
Sure.

338
00:51:35,625 --> 00:51:37,252
- Here.
- Thank you.

339
00:52:09,159 --> 00:52:11,753
All right. Thank you.

340
00:52:11,828 --> 00:52:15,423
I feel much better now.
I'm fine.

341
00:52:15,499 --> 00:52:19,435
I saw you back there
and at the hotel.

342
00:52:19,503 --> 00:52:23,234
- You've been following me.
- Yeah.

343
00:52:25,675 --> 00:52:28,872
Why?
Did my husband hire you?

344
00:52:35,352 --> 00:52:36,785
I'm...

345
00:52:39,723 --> 00:52:41,156
What?

346
00:53:51,428 --> 00:53:52,861
Yes.

347
00:54:22,058 --> 00:54:25,050
I can't.
I can't do this.

348
00:54:25,128 --> 00:54:26,561
Not here.

349
00:54:45,982 --> 00:54:48,815
Hello, Gloria.
How are you?

350
00:54:48,885 --> 00:54:51,752
Maybe you remember me.
This is Jake.

351
00:54:51,821 --> 00:54:55,416
I'm the guy that almost fucked you
at the beach today.

352
00:54:56,493 --> 00:54:58,256
No, that's terrible.

353
00:55:02,098 --> 00:55:03,531
Hi, Gloria.

354
00:56:38,661 --> 00:56:40,754
- Hello?
- How are you doing?

355
00:56:40,830 --> 00:56:43,264
Sam, how's everything?

356
00:56:43,333 --> 00:56:45,927
Great.
Everything okay over there?

357
00:56:46,002 --> 00:56:48,334
Yeah. No problems.

358
00:56:48,405 --> 00:56:52,239
How's our favorite neighbor?
Still with the midnight shows?

359
00:56:56,513 --> 00:56:59,914
- Uh-huh?
- You sound a little preoccupied.

360
00:57:05,855 --> 00:57:07,789
I just called
to see how things were going.

361
00:57:07,857 --> 00:57:10,451
By the way,
any messages for me?

362
00:57:14,531 --> 00:57:20,060
- Hello? Are you there?
- Yeah.

363
00:57:20,136 --> 00:57:24,300
I'm here. I'm sorry.
There are no messages.

364
00:57:25,708 --> 00:57:28,336
Gotta run.
I'll be in touch.

365
00:57:41,224 --> 00:57:42,657
My God.

366
00:59:38,474 --> 00:59:40,442
If you'd like to make a call,
please...

367
00:59:50,753 --> 00:59:52,812
Hurry.

368
01:00:15,378 --> 01:00:18,074
- Hello.
- Look out! He's right behind you!

369
01:00:18,147 --> 01:00:20,479
- What?
- My God!

370
01:01:00,423 --> 01:01:02,823
Stop! You guys, stop!

371
01:01:16,439 --> 01:01:19,533
What do you want?
Are you crazy?

372
01:01:19,609 --> 01:01:21,873
- There's a woman being killed.
- What?

373
01:01:21,944 --> 01:01:23,707
Come on!

374
01:01:58,414 --> 01:02:02,248
L.A. City Emergency. This is 911.
What are you reporting?

375
01:02:03,319 --> 01:02:07,756
This is L.A. City Emergency.
Hello?

376
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:14,890
I'm sorry, I cant hear you.
Please...

377
01:02:18,101 --> 01:02:21,434
Please tell me the nature
of your emergency.

378
01:02:29,112 --> 01:02:30,545
Don't.

379
01:02:35,084 --> 01:02:37,109
No. Please, don't.

380
01:04:25,061 --> 01:04:27,757
Get him off me!
He's killing her!

381
01:04:43,012 --> 01:04:44,445
Stop!

382
01:04:56,325 --> 01:04:57,917
God!

383
01:05:18,714 --> 01:05:21,376
I'm Detective McLean.

384
01:05:21,450 --> 01:05:23,645
I'm in charge
of this investigation.

385
01:05:26,188 --> 01:05:28,122
I see you're an actor.

386
01:05:33,562 --> 01:05:35,553
Yeah.

387
01:05:35,631 --> 01:05:37,565
Ever been in anything?

388
01:05:39,535 --> 01:05:42,470
'Emerald Point" and a "Hart To Hart"
that was pretty good.

389
01:05:43,539 --> 01:05:45,302
Very interesting.

390
01:05:46,375 --> 01:05:48,309
You make a living?

391
01:05:50,980 --> 01:05:52,413
Yeah.

392
01:05:53,582 --> 01:05:55,812
Good-looking boy.

393
01:05:55,885 --> 01:05:57,318
Talented.

394
01:05:58,487 --> 01:06:00,785
I got a real problem with you.

395
01:06:02,658 --> 01:06:04,148
What do you mean?

396
01:06:04,226 --> 01:06:07,718
I mean, you're my only witness
to this murder...

397
01:06:07,797 --> 01:06:09,731
and you're a peeper.

398
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:14,365
In my book, that's a pervert
and a sex offender.

399
01:06:14,437 --> 01:06:17,270
- What do you mean "a sex offender"?
- Save it.

400
01:06:17,340 --> 01:06:19,900
I ask the questions.

401
01:06:20,142 --> 01:06:23,236
What about this Indian? When he snatched
her pocketbook, you got it back.

402
01:06:23,312 --> 01:06:25,906
- Is that right?
- That's right.

403
01:06:25,982 --> 01:06:27,950
Was anything missing?

404
01:06:28,017 --> 01:06:29,951
I saw him take a credit card.

405
01:06:31,287 --> 01:06:34,518
Not a credit card, a card key.

406
01:06:34,590 --> 01:06:36,615
He used it to get into her house.

407
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:45,395
Did Gloria know it was missing?

408
01:06:45,468 --> 01:06:47,868
She didn't say anything to me.

409
01:06:49,872 --> 01:06:51,806
You talked to her?

410
01:06:54,310 --> 01:06:56,801
Come on,
you must have said something.

411
01:07:04,453 --> 01:07:07,354
- It was just small talk, you know?
- No, I don't know.

412
01:07:07,423 --> 01:07:09,357
Did you come on to her?

413
01:07:09,425 --> 01:07:11,450
Were you trying to do a number
on her head?

414
01:07:11,527 --> 01:07:13,518
Trying to freak her out
with all you know about her?

415
01:07:13,596 --> 01:07:17,225
- You're wrong.
- Why were you following Gloria Revelle?

416
01:07:18,901 --> 01:07:22,997
Because I got concerned
when I saw that guy following her.

417
01:07:23,072 --> 01:07:26,064
But you kept on her tail
after this other guy disappeared.

418
01:07:26,142 --> 01:07:27,575
I know, because...

419
01:07:28,811 --> 01:07:32,577
- I guess I wanted to...
- You wanted to what?

420
01:07:43,759 --> 01:07:45,192
Nothing.

421
01:07:52,368 --> 01:07:53,801
What's this?

422
01:07:58,040 --> 01:08:00,372
Some underpants.

423
01:08:00,443 --> 01:08:01,876
Yours?

424
01:08:04,046 --> 01:08:05,570
Where did you get them?

425
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:14,382
She dropped them in the trash.

426
01:08:14,457 --> 01:08:16,550
- Who?
- Gloria.

427
01:08:16,625 --> 01:08:18,616
And you just picked them up?

428
01:08:20,362 --> 01:08:22,330
- Yeah.
- Why?

429
01:08:29,371 --> 01:08:32,204
- I don't know.
- Tell the truth.

430
01:08:32,274 --> 01:08:34,936
You fucked her and kept them
for a souvenir.

431
01:08:35,010 --> 01:08:37,945
You didn't fuck her or you didn't
keep them as a souvenir?

432
01:08:38,013 --> 01:08:41,505
- No to both of them.
- Are you just a harmless panty sniffer?

433
01:08:41,584 --> 01:08:43,916
- You got a dirty mind.
- That's a laugh.

434
01:08:43,986 --> 01:08:47,945
You peep on her, follow her, fuck her
and keep her panties as a memento.

435
01:08:48,023 --> 01:08:51,015
Then you sit on the 50-yard line
and watch her being slaughtered!

436
01:08:51,093 --> 01:08:53,584
That's not what happened!
I tried to save her!

437
01:08:58,467 --> 01:09:02,494
Mm-hmm. Some save, Scully.

438
01:09:05,074 --> 01:09:08,168
Remind me to never put my life
in your hands.

439
01:09:13,048 --> 01:09:14,982
Tell me about Alexander Revelle.

440
01:09:19,155 --> 01:09:23,387
- What?
- Alexander Revelle, Gloria's husband.

441
01:09:23,459 --> 01:09:24,983
You knew him?

442
01:09:27,863 --> 01:09:29,296
I never met him.

443
01:09:31,534 --> 01:09:34,025
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

444
01:09:35,271 --> 01:09:38,069
Was he around
when Gloria got nailed?

445
01:09:39,575 --> 01:09:41,566
Do you think he had something
to do with it?

446
01:09:43,379 --> 01:09:47,247
Gloria Revelle was a very rich lady.

447
01:09:49,385 --> 01:09:53,754
When rich wives get dead,
I usually go after the husband.

448
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:59,218
The only problem is
you saw a thief.

449
01:09:59,295 --> 01:10:01,763
An Indian killed Gloria Revelle.

450
01:10:08,170 --> 01:10:10,866
I won't hold you, Scully.

451
01:10:10,940 --> 01:10:13,875
We have witnesses
to back up your story.

452
01:10:15,077 --> 01:10:18,410
But I want you
to think real hard about this.

453
01:10:19,481 --> 01:10:20,948
As far as I'm concerned...

454
01:10:21,016 --> 01:10:24,417
you're the real reason Gloria Revelle
got murdered.

455
01:10:26,855 --> 01:10:30,552
If you hadn't been so busy getting off
by peeping on her...

456
01:10:30,626 --> 01:10:34,653
if you had called the police
about your blood brother, the Indian...

457
01:10:34,730 --> 01:10:37,597
Gloria Revelle would still be alive.

458
01:10:55,918 --> 01:10:57,351
Oh, yeah.

459
01:11:11,533 --> 01:11:15,469
Linda, we believe that you have
your own production company now.

460
01:11:15,537 --> 01:11:18,870
Yes, Linda Shaw Enterprises.

461
01:11:18,941 --> 01:11:21,603
What are some of those enterprises?

462
01:11:21,677 --> 01:11:25,807
We have a film 'Deep Ghost'
and 'The Mating Game. '

463
01:11:27,583 --> 01:11:31,610
- 'One Night at a Time. '
- Yes.

464
01:11:31,687 --> 01:11:37,148
I believe you have a film opening
this Friday at the Pussy Flick Theater?

465
01:11:37,226 --> 01:11:41,754
- What is the title of that?
- Thats 'Bold Obsession. '

466
01:11:41,830 --> 01:11:45,357
Tell us, Linda,
what is your 'bold obsession'?

467
01:11:45,434 --> 01:11:50,497
Sid, that script was written especially
for me, because I am an expositionist.

468
01:11:50,572 --> 01:11:53,405
You are an 'expositions'?
Do you mean an exhibitionist?

469
01:11:53,475 --> 01:11:55,943
- Yes, exhibitionist.
- Yeah, I'm sure.

470
01:11:56,011 --> 01:11:59,606
I just get so excited when I know
theyre all out there watching me.

471
01:11:59,682 --> 01:12:02,207
Of course
they're out there watching you.

472
01:12:02,284 --> 01:12:04,514
- It gets me so hot.
- It does?

473
01:12:04,586 --> 01:12:06,554
What happens when you get hot?

474
01:12:06,622 --> 01:12:09,056
- It makes me want to come.
- You want to come.

475
01:12:09,124 --> 01:12:11,354
While you're coming,
lets watch this clip.

476
01:12:12,695 --> 01:12:15,163
Five minutes, Miss Body.

477
01:12:15,230 --> 01:12:16,663
I'm ready.

478
01:12:19,068 --> 01:12:21,536
We've got five minutes.

479
01:12:23,272 --> 01:12:26,901
Eddie, where the hell are you?
We need you on the set.

480
01:12:26,975 --> 01:12:30,138

Says Eros Magazine: 'The 'Gone
With The Wind' Of Adult Films. '

489
01:12:56,372 --> 01:12:59,808
'Holly Does Hollywood'

490
01:13:03,946 --> 01:13:06,847

Yeah, we do. It's in our adult section.
Follow me.

499
01:13:54,897 --> 01:13:57,593
- On VHS?
- Yeah, VHS. Whatever you want.

500
01:13:57,666 --> 01:14:00,635
Half-inch, three-quarter, Beta.

501
01:14:03,238 --> 01:14:06,298
- Is this what you're talking about?
- That's it.

502
01:15:05,701 --> 01:15:08,795
- Hello. Adult Blue Films.
- I was wondering if you could help me.

503
01:15:08,871 --> 01:15:11,135
Are you the company that distributes
"Holly Does Hollywood"?

504
01:15:11,206 --> 01:15:14,004
- Yes.
- I'm not some fucking stunt cock.

505
01:15:14,076 --> 01:15:16,636
- I'm an actor.
- Youll have to wait.

506
01:15:16,712 --> 01:15:20,148
I have been waiting,
for more than an hour.

507
01:15:20,215 --> 01:15:23,241
Do you know how many pictures
I've made with Holly?

508
01:15:23,318 --> 01:15:25,377
Baby, I am sure
you have made a lot.

509
01:15:25,454 --> 01:15:27,388
I don't have to take this shit.

510
01:15:27,456 --> 01:15:29,321
I got a reputation
in this business.

511
01:15:29,391 --> 01:15:31,518
If you want to audition,
sit down!

512
01:15:31,593 --> 01:15:35,051
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

513
01:15:35,130 --> 01:15:37,564
- Can I help you?
- How late are the auditions going today?

514
01:15:37,633 --> 01:15:40,067
- Probably past 6:00.
- Thank you.

515
01:15:40,135 --> 01:15:41,898
You're welcome. Bye.

516
01:15:45,307 --> 01:15:47,537
Mr. Corso, Jake Scully.

517
01:15:49,111 --> 01:15:50,578
Pleasure to meet you.

518
01:15:51,647 --> 01:15:53,080
Stand over there.

519
01:15:56,184 --> 01:15:58,550
- You ready?
- Yeah.

520
01:15:58,620 --> 01:16:00,053
Go ahead.

521
01:16:03,158 --> 01:16:06,252
I like to watch.

522
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:10,164
Makes you hot, doesn't it?

523
01:16:11,833 --> 01:16:13,266
Yeah.

524
01:16:14,369 --> 01:16:16,599
Makes me hot too.
Real hot.

525
01:16:16,672 --> 01:16:19,766
Come over here.
I'll show you how hot.

526
01:16:21,677 --> 01:16:24,111
All right.
Take off your clothes.

527
01:16:24,179 --> 01:16:26,113
I want to take some pictures.

528
01:16:32,020 --> 01:16:35,751
- What is it that we're watching?
- I don't know.

529
01:16:35,824 --> 01:16:38,884
Are you some kind of method actor?

530
01:16:46,535 --> 01:16:50,471
Give it to me one time now

531
01:17:05,621 --> 01:17:08,317
Relax
Dont do it

532
01:17:08,390 --> 01:17:10,085
When you wanna go for it

533
01:17:12,561 --> 01:17:14,324
When you wanna come

534
01:17:16,732 --> 01:17:19,132
When you wanna suck to it

535
01:18:02,444 --> 01:18:05,538
But shoot it
in the right direction

536
01:18:06,615 --> 01:18:09,550
Make making it your intention

537
01:18:10,786 --> 01:18:12,811
Live those dreams

538
01:18:12,888 --> 01:18:14,719
Scheme those schemes

539
01:18:14,790 --> 01:18:16,883
- Gotta hit me
- Hit me

540
01:18:16,958 --> 01:18:20,155
Hit me with those laser beams

541
01:19:13,215 --> 01:19:15,149
I like to watch.

542
01:19:19,287 --> 01:19:21,949
Makes you hot, doesn't it?

543
01:19:22,023 --> 01:19:23,456
Yeah.

544
01:19:25,026 --> 01:19:26,618
Makes me hot too.

545
01:19:28,296 --> 01:19:31,356
Come over here,
and I'II show you how hot.

546
01:21:51,306 --> 01:21:53,774
- Where's the come shot?
- Huh? Come?

547
01:21:53,842 --> 01:21:56,902
The come shot. I thought we were doing
'Body Talk" here, not 'Last Tango."

548
01:22:03,919 --> 01:22:07,047
You were great out there. Really.
Come on, I'II buy you a drink.

549
01:22:08,690 --> 01:22:11,181
A drink?
I don't even know you.

550
01:22:11,259 --> 01:22:14,285
I'm talking business.

551
01:22:14,362 --> 01:22:15,795
Come on.

552
01:22:16,865 --> 01:22:19,299
You know the mirror out there?

553
01:22:19,367 --> 01:22:21,301
That was my idea.

554
01:22:22,704 --> 01:22:25,673
So, you're a genius.

555
01:22:25,740 --> 01:22:30,541
No, but I can make a better film
than Corso, with my eyes closed.

556
01:22:30,612 --> 01:22:33,638
Films cost money, you know.

557
01:22:33,715 --> 01:22:35,148
I got money.

558
01:22:37,819 --> 01:22:40,310
Then what are you doing in hard-core?

559
01:22:40,388 --> 01:22:41,946
I wanted to meet you.

560
01:22:43,425 --> 01:22:45,325
Why?

561
01:22:45,393 --> 01:22:49,329
Because I think you're sensational.
I think you're the best in the business.

562
01:22:49,397 --> 01:22:52,025
I'll pay you top dollar.
I'll give you points.

563
01:22:52,100 --> 01:22:54,068
Whatever it takes.

564
01:22:55,603 --> 01:22:59,164
- Really?
- I want you in my picture.

565
01:22:59,240 --> 01:23:03,301
- You're really serious?
- Yeah, of course I am.

566
01:23:03,378 --> 01:23:04,811
Okay, good.

567
01:23:06,581 --> 01:23:09,106
There are some things I like
to get straight up front...

568
01:23:09,184 --> 01:23:11,550
so there are no misunderstandings
later on.

569
01:23:11,619 --> 01:23:14,645
- I don't blame you.
- I do not do animal acts.

570
01:23:14,723 --> 01:23:18,625
I do not do S and M or any variations
of that particular bent.

571
01:23:18,693 --> 01:23:20,661
No water sports either.

572
01:23:20,729 --> 01:23:23,163
I will not shave my pussy,
no fist fucking...

573
01:23:23,231 --> 01:23:25,756
and absolutely no coming in my face.

574
01:23:25,834 --> 01:23:30,999
I get $2,000 a day,
and I do not work without a contract.

575
01:23:36,544 --> 01:23:38,512
Fine.
I mean, that's no problem.

576
01:23:41,082 --> 01:23:44,745
- I think we got a deal.
- Cheers.

577
01:23:46,621 --> 01:23:48,555
You ever do any specialty work?

578
01:23:50,492 --> 01:23:53,188
What kind of specialty work
are you looking for?

579
01:23:54,829 --> 01:23:57,457
A woman alone,
getting herself off.

580
01:23:59,434 --> 01:24:00,958
It's got to be really hot.

581
01:24:04,506 --> 01:24:05,939
Is that all?

582
01:24:07,375 --> 01:24:11,175
I have a routine that is a sure ten
on the peter-meter.

583
01:24:12,247 --> 01:24:14,477
- I know. I've seen it.
- Yeah?

584
01:24:14,549 --> 01:24:16,483
A few times.

585
01:24:16,551 --> 01:24:20,078
Yeah, I'm known far and wide...

586
01:24:20,155 --> 01:24:22,521
for that little bit of business.

587
01:24:27,929 --> 01:24:30,363
I want you to know
I saw 'Holly Does Hollywood"...

588
01:24:30,432 --> 01:24:34,664
and I think your acting
is top drawer.

589
01:24:38,239 --> 01:24:40,139
- My acting?
- Yep.

590
01:24:40,208 --> 01:24:44,440
You're fantastic.
Really. Sensational.

591
01:24:44,512 --> 01:24:47,276
I'II tell you something else.

592
01:24:47,348 --> 01:24:49,816
- You have got a terrific...
- Body.

593
01:24:51,386 --> 01:24:52,819
Smile.

594
01:24:56,691 --> 01:24:58,124
Smile"?

595
01:25:06,901 --> 01:25:09,301
Look at you.

596
01:25:09,370 --> 01:25:12,168
- Kimberly, how are you?
- I'm fine, just lovely.

597
01:25:12,240 --> 01:25:16,643
Aren't you going to introduce me
to your friend?

598
01:25:18,179 --> 01:25:20,613
- Kimberly Hess. Hello.
- Nice to know you.

599
01:25:21,516 --> 01:25:23,711
So, Jake, you working?

600
01:25:23,785 --> 01:25:26,447
Yeah, here and there.
We have to run.

601
01:25:26,521 --> 01:25:28,216
- It's great to see you though.
- Right.

602
01:25:28,289 --> 01:25:30,280
Jake and I worked together
in the past.

603
01:25:30,358 --> 01:25:31,791
- Really?
- Yeah.

604
01:25:31,860 --> 01:25:35,261
I thought I knew everybody
in this business.

605
01:25:36,831 --> 01:25:38,298
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

606
01:25:38,366 --> 01:25:40,994
I don't see how someone
could know everyone.

607
01:25:41,069 --> 01:25:42,969
It's a funny business.

608
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:47,131
Anyway, I wanted to ask you...

609
01:25:47,208 --> 01:25:50,803
have you heard of any roles
that might be right for...

610
01:25:50,879 --> 01:25:53,973
- No, I'm sorry.
- I have. I have a tip for you.

611
01:25:54,048 --> 01:25:56,881
- Really?
- Yes, Simon La Farge is casting.

612
01:25:56,951 --> 01:25:58,976
- You know him, right?
- No.

613
01:25:59,053 --> 01:26:01,988
No? Are you from outer space?

614
01:26:02,056 --> 01:26:05,992
Just tell him that you ran into me.
Here's his number.

615
01:26:06,060 --> 01:26:09,826
You might want to firm up a bit
before you go and see him.

616
01:26:09,898 --> 01:26:13,493
One more thing.
Do you mind working with ladies?

617
01:26:15,570 --> 01:26:18,664
- Acting is acting, right?
- That's right.

618
01:26:18,740 --> 01:26:21,334
I think that's really admirable.

619
01:26:21,409 --> 01:26:23,343
Me, myself, I can't get into it.

620
01:26:23,411 --> 01:26:26,847
But, anyway, good luck
and say hello to Simon for me.

621
01:26:26,915 --> 01:26:29,645
- Good seeing you.
- Sure. Thanks.

622
01:26:29,717 --> 01:26:31,150
By the way...

623
01:26:32,954 --> 01:26:35,047
what's the film about?

624
01:26:35,123 --> 01:26:36,852
That's good.

625
01:26:36,925 --> 01:26:39,189
We need more comedians
in our business.

626
01:26:39,260 --> 01:26:40,750
Good luck.

627
01:26:45,767 --> 01:26:47,200
Very nice.

628
01:26:48,603 --> 01:26:51,037
What can I get you?
Jack Daniels?

629
01:26:52,273 --> 01:26:55,208
How about Jake Scully...

630
01:26:55,276 --> 01:26:56,709
straight up?

631
01:26:58,279 --> 01:26:59,712
Very funny.

632
01:27:10,792 --> 01:27:12,225
Hello.

633
01:27:19,801 --> 01:27:21,393
Listen, Holly...

634
01:27:21,469 --> 01:27:23,403
I don't want to talk
any more business.

635
01:27:23,471 --> 01:27:24,904
Yeah, well...

636
01:27:24,973 --> 01:27:26,406
Listen.

637
01:27:26,474 --> 01:27:27,907
Lie down.

638
01:27:34,315 --> 01:27:36,909
We had one of these
in "Star Whores."

639
01:27:37,986 --> 01:27:40,580
There's something I gotta tell you.

640
01:27:40,655 --> 01:27:42,247
You're married.

641
01:27:42,323 --> 01:27:44,257
- What then?
- I'm not a producer.

642
01:27:44,325 --> 01:27:46,259
You're not a producer.

643
01:27:47,996 --> 01:27:51,090
l... Hold up. I'm not...

644
01:27:52,667 --> 01:27:54,100
Just a second.

645
01:27:55,503 --> 01:27:58,939
I'm not interested
in making a film with you.

646
01:28:01,175 --> 01:28:04,269
- What are you interested in then?
- You.

647
01:28:05,513 --> 01:28:09,449
I saw you in the house
those other nights.

648
01:28:09,517 --> 01:28:10,950
What house?

649
01:28:12,186 --> 01:28:15,121
You know,
that show that you put on...

650
01:28:15,189 --> 01:28:17,953
with the masturbation routine
and all the diamonds and everything.

651
01:28:18,026 --> 01:28:19,960
I was watching you from here.

652
01:28:23,364 --> 01:28:27,562
You were the girl in the window.
That wasn't Gloria. That was you.

653
01:28:28,870 --> 01:28:30,337
What's it to you?

654
01:28:30,405 --> 01:28:34,307
Just tell me if I'm right.
That was you in the Revelle house.

655
01:28:34,375 --> 01:28:35,808
Right?

656
01:28:37,545 --> 01:28:40,810
I'm not saying that it was me,
and I'm not saying that it wasn't me.

657
01:28:40,882 --> 01:28:44,113
I'm saying,
why are you interested in knowing?

658
01:28:50,391 --> 01:28:55,988
I think that one of my crazy friends
has played a practical joke on me.

659
01:28:56,064 --> 01:28:58,328
You know how it is
with the idle rich.

660
01:29:01,903 --> 01:29:07,000
Tell me, were you the girl
in the house?

661
01:29:07,075 --> 01:29:08,667
- Yeah, that was me.
- I knew it.

662
01:29:08,743 --> 01:29:11,678
How did this thing get set up?

663
01:29:11,746 --> 01:29:15,182
Tell me just to satisfy my curiosity.

664
01:29:15,249 --> 01:29:19,345
One of my crazy friends set this up,
but I don't know who.

665
01:29:19,420 --> 01:29:20,853
Who hired you?

666
01:29:20,922 --> 01:29:24,187
- You were the one I was playing to?
- Yeah.

667
01:29:24,258 --> 01:29:27,694
- And there's no part for me.
- I'm sorry.

668
01:29:27,762 --> 01:29:30,026
- This whole thing was a joke.
- Yeah.

669
01:29:30,098 --> 01:29:32,032
It was a practical joke on me.

670
01:29:32,100 --> 01:29:35,194
Did Sam Bouchard
set this whole thing up?

671
01:29:35,269 --> 01:29:37,203
Did he hire you
to do your routine?

672
01:29:37,271 --> 01:29:39,535
He didn't tell me his name.

673
01:29:39,607 --> 01:29:43,043
Whoever you talked to,
what did he say?

674
01:29:44,612 --> 01:29:48,378
This guy called me up and said
he had seen my self-help routine...

675
01:29:48,449 --> 01:29:50,041
in 'Holly Does Hollywood"...

676
01:29:50,118 --> 01:29:53,383
and he wanted to hire me
to do it in private.

677
01:29:53,454 --> 01:29:57,891
He said that he had this friend
who got off on peeping.

678
01:29:57,959 --> 01:30:01,895
- He didn't tell you who he was?
- No. He didn't tell me his name.

679
01:30:01,963 --> 01:30:05,228
He just sent a messenger over
with money...

680
01:30:05,299 --> 01:30:08,234
and with a card key...

681
01:30:08,302 --> 01:30:10,395
and a wig.

682
01:30:10,471 --> 01:30:11,904
Please don't leave.

683
01:30:11,973 --> 01:30:15,409
Just stay here for a second.

684
01:30:15,476 --> 01:30:16,909
Can you hold on?

685
01:30:19,814 --> 01:30:21,406
- Hello.
- Lf's Sam.

686
01:30:21,482 --> 01:30:24,576
- How are you doing? Can you hold on?
- Sure.

687
01:30:24,652 --> 01:30:26,085
Hold on.

688
01:30:27,488 --> 01:30:29,251
Please, listen to this guy's voice.

689
01:30:29,323 --> 01:30:33,089
Tell me if he's the one
that hired you. Please.

690
01:30:33,161 --> 01:30:36,255
Hello. I'm sorry. You got me
in the shower. How are you doing?

691
01:30:36,330 --> 01:30:40,596
- I'm afraid I got some bad news, pal.
- What's that?

692
01:30:40,668 --> 01:30:42,932
Seattle Rep and I
had some artistic differences.

693
01:30:43,004 --> 01:30:44,938
I'm gonna be heading back to L.A.

694
01:30:45,006 --> 01:30:48,601
So I guess you'll have to find
another place to crash.

695
01:30:48,676 --> 01:30:50,109
That's him.

696
01:30:50,178 --> 01:30:52,612
- You got some company there?
- Actually, I do.

697
01:30:52,680 --> 01:30:56,275
It's kind of a bad time to talk.
You want to call back in 15 minutes?

698
01:30:56,350 --> 01:30:59,786
- Yeah...
- That was the guy who hired you?

699
01:30:59,854 --> 01:31:01,617
- Yes, that was him.
- Are you sure?

700
01:31:01,689 --> 01:31:03,782
- Yes, I'm sure that was him.
- Listen.

701
01:31:03,858 --> 01:31:07,453
- God, you're really sick.
- Listen to me very carefully.

702
01:31:07,528 --> 01:31:11,123
I am not a film producer,
and I am not a rich kid.

703
01:31:11,199 --> 01:31:12,791
No, you're a jerk.

704
01:31:12,867 --> 01:31:15,301
Holly, please listen to me
for a second.

705
01:31:16,871 --> 01:31:21,808
You were hired to do two nights' work,
to do your routine and leave.

706
01:31:21,876 --> 01:31:23,468
- Is that true?
- Yes.

707
01:31:23,544 --> 01:31:25,978
- Do you know why?
- You just told me why.

708
01:31:26,047 --> 01:31:28,982
You just told me some guy
was playing a joke on you.

709
01:31:29,050 --> 01:31:30,813
He wasn't playing a joke on you?

710
01:31:30,885 --> 01:31:33,820
- Do you want to tell me what it was?
- Yes.

711
01:31:33,888 --> 01:31:36,322
The truth.

712
01:31:36,390 --> 01:31:38,824
The truth is a woman was murdered.

713
01:31:40,728 --> 01:31:44,494
It's not funny. A woman was murdered.
You and I were set up by a murderer.

714
01:31:44,565 --> 01:31:46,658
He wanted to be sure
I witnessed the murder.

715
01:31:46,734 --> 01:31:48,668
That's why he hired you
to do your routine.

716
01:31:48,736 --> 01:31:51,170
Meanwhile, he arranged it
so that I would be watching.

717
01:31:51,239 --> 01:31:54,174
He wanted me to think that the girl
who lived there, Gloria Revelle...

718
01:31:54,242 --> 01:31:55,675
was the one getting off.

719
01:31:55,743 --> 01:31:59,008
Meanwhile, he thought I would watch
and keep watching.

720
01:31:59,080 --> 01:32:01,844
Holly, are you listening to me?

721
01:32:01,916 --> 01:32:04,350
Yes.
I don't understand what you've said.

722
01:32:04,418 --> 01:32:06,682
Listen, he's a murderer!

723
01:32:06,754 --> 01:32:09,348
The man who hired you is a murderer!
Come here.

724
01:32:10,758 --> 01:32:12,316
Please, come here.

725
01:32:12,393 --> 01:32:14,293
Do you remember
where you did your routine?

726
01:32:14,362 --> 01:32:16,887
- Yes.
- You see that house down there?

727
01:32:16,964 --> 01:32:19,023
- That window is where you were, right?
- Yes.

728
01:32:27,375 --> 01:32:29,866
- Now do you understand?
- Yes, I understand.

729
01:32:29,944 --> 01:32:33,539
I understand you're sick and you're
a liar and you need professional help.

730
01:32:33,614 --> 01:32:35,707
- I do not like being yelled at!
- I'm sorry.

731
01:32:35,783 --> 01:32:37,876
I should have known when you told me
I had a terrific smile.

732
01:32:37,952 --> 01:32:40,386
No real producer would tell me that
in a million years.

733
01:32:40,454 --> 01:32:42,319
Get out of my way.

734
01:32:42,390 --> 01:32:44,324
- What?
- Just come with me to the police.

735
01:32:44,392 --> 01:32:47,725
To the police? Are you crazy?
Listen to me, you weirdo...

736
01:32:47,795 --> 01:32:50,389
- A woman was murdered!
- I'm leaving! Don't follow me home!

737
01:32:50,464 --> 01:32:52,295
I have friends
who will break your legs!

738
01:32:53,467 --> 01:32:55,867
Let go of me! God!

739
01:32:55,937 --> 01:32:58,405
You weirdo!
There are so many weird people.

740
01:33:11,152 --> 01:33:13,780
Can I have the Hollywood
Police Department, please?

741
01:33:13,854 --> 01:33:15,788
Fucking freaky actors.

742
01:33:15,856 --> 01:33:17,585
That's what there is here.

743
01:33:17,658 --> 01:33:20,422
Masochistic directors.

744
01:33:20,494 --> 01:33:23,588
I should have known when he didn't
even know what a come shot was.

745
01:33:25,166 --> 01:33:27,259
Yeah, Detective McLean, please.

746
01:33:34,342 --> 01:33:36,606
Excuse me.
Stop, please.

747
01:33:37,845 --> 01:33:40,109
Thank you very much, lady!

748
01:33:43,985 --> 01:33:45,418
I was set up.

749
01:33:47,188 --> 01:33:50,646
Yeah, Hollywood's busiest
sex offender.

750
01:33:50,725 --> 01:33:52,659
Cut it out.
Just listen to me for a minute.

751
01:33:52,727 --> 01:33:54,786
I got something important
to tell you.

752
01:33:55,863 --> 01:33:57,694
I know who killed Gloria Revelle.

753
01:33:57,765 --> 01:33:59,426
Is this a confession?

754
01:34:00,701 --> 01:34:02,134
Listen.

755
01:34:03,204 --> 01:34:05,138
Just pay attention.

756
01:34:05,206 --> 01:34:07,731
A few days ago I was looking
for an apartment.

757
01:34:07,808 --> 01:34:11,141
Do you know any sublets
that would be available right away?

758
01:34:11,212 --> 01:34:12,975
I'll check around.

759
01:34:13,047 --> 01:34:16,813
I noticed this guy,
Sam Bouchard.

760
01:34:16,884 --> 01:34:19,478
He was looking for somebody
who needed a place to stay.

761
01:34:19,553 --> 01:34:22,989
I thought it was a coincidence
that we kept running info each other.

762
01:34:24,225 --> 01:34:26,455
Hi. Again.

763
01:34:26,527 --> 01:34:30,486
Anyway, now I realize
he was throwing out a net.

764
01:34:30,564 --> 01:34:33,465
He was sizing me up
for a part that he was casting.

765
01:34:33,534 --> 01:34:35,661
I want you to cry out for help!

766
01:34:37,805 --> 01:34:39,238
I can't.

767
01:34:39,306 --> 01:34:44,334
I fit the bill perfectly:
lovesick sucker, out on his ass.

768
01:34:44,412 --> 01:34:46,607
Shit.
What a fool I am.

769
01:34:46,681 --> 01:34:48,581
And you know what the part was?

770
01:34:48,649 --> 01:34:50,207
I'm listening.

771
01:34:50,284 --> 01:34:52,718
The part of the witness.

772
01:34:52,787 --> 01:34:56,917
He told me there was this neighbor that
did this number on herself every night.

773
01:34:56,991 --> 01:35:00,085
- See her?
- He knew that I would look.

774
01:35:00,161 --> 01:35:02,254
- Nice, huh?
- Yeah.

775
01:35:02,329 --> 01:35:05,560
He knew I would keep looking.
And it wasnt Gloria.

776
01:35:05,633 --> 01:35:08,397
It was Holly doing her routine.
Thats why I never saw her face.

777
01:35:10,104 --> 01:35:13,267
You sound like a conspiracy nut:
plots all around you.

778
01:35:13,340 --> 01:35:15,535
Please, just listen to me
for a second.

779
01:35:17,111 --> 01:35:20,410
Sam Bouchard is Alexander Revelle.

780
01:35:21,515 --> 01:35:23,745
He hired the Indian
to follow Gloria...

781
01:35:23,818 --> 01:35:26,810
and snatch her purse
and steal the card key to her house...

782
01:35:26,887 --> 01:35:29,583
and then sneak inside.

783
01:35:29,657 --> 01:35:32,125
Then when she got home...

784
01:35:32,193 --> 01:35:36,186
the Indian opened the blinds
so I could see him kill her.

785
01:35:36,263 --> 01:35:41,166
Alexander Revelle set me up
in this house to witness the murder.

786
01:35:42,269 --> 01:35:44,567
He hired a porno actress
to be the bait.

787
01:35:47,842 --> 01:35:50,640
Can I have a ride, please?

788
01:35:50,711 --> 01:35:52,645
Thanks a lot, you jerks!

789
01:36:02,990 --> 01:36:04,457
Oh, my God.

790
01:36:04,525 --> 01:36:08,256
I've been trying to build a case
against the husband all along...

791
01:36:08,329 --> 01:36:10,263
but the reason
it hasn't panned out...

792
01:36:10,331 --> 01:36:14,233
is because of your testimony
that Gloria was killed by an Indian.

793
01:36:14,301 --> 01:36:17,236
That's just it! Don't you see?
That's what he wanted!

794
01:36:17,304 --> 01:36:19,101
It looks like a burglary,
but it's a murder...

795
01:36:19,173 --> 01:36:21,607
with me set up
to be the witness!

796
01:36:21,675 --> 01:36:24,542
I'm Alexander Revelle's alibi.

797
01:36:27,782 --> 01:36:30,774
Listen. Stop, all right?

798
01:36:30,851 --> 01:36:35,720
Just stop! Right there!

799
01:36:36,791 --> 01:36:39,282
There has been an accident
up there.

800
01:36:39,360 --> 01:36:42,796
- Those people are probably very hurt.
- Slow down, lady.

801
01:36:42,863 --> 01:36:45,093
- Nobody's bothered to stop.
- Get in the car.

802
01:36:45,166 --> 01:36:47,100
It sounds crazy to me.

803
01:36:48,202 --> 01:36:51,171
I know, but it's the truth.

804
01:36:54,208 --> 01:36:56,733
Maybe you better come down here.

805
01:37:14,161 --> 01:37:17,562
Pull it up. That's it.
Pull your car right up there.

806
01:37:19,266 --> 01:37:22,565
Stay in your car, please.
There's nothing to look at.

807
01:37:22,636 --> 01:37:24,763
We'll have it cleaned up
in a couple minutes.

808
01:37:28,108 --> 01:37:30,269
Get back in your car, sir.

809
01:37:32,179 --> 01:37:35,012
Officer, there's a woman being killed
in that Ford Bronco right there.

810
01:37:36,684 --> 01:37:39,380
He's killing her. He just hit her
in the back of the head.

811
01:37:39,453 --> 01:37:41,182
We gotta do something
to help her.

812
01:37:41,255 --> 01:37:45,123
- Get back in your car.
- He's killing her. He hit her.

813
01:37:46,794 --> 01:37:49,354
- I don't have time to run you in.
- Please!

814
01:37:49,430 --> 01:37:51,557
He's getting away.
Please call somebody on your radio.

815
01:37:51,632 --> 01:37:54,601
Don't you understand?
I saw him killing her!

816
01:37:54,668 --> 01:37:57,136
- You fucking idiot!
- All right, that's it, buddy.

817
01:37:57,204 --> 01:37:59,638
- You're coming with me.
- Call Detective McLean.

818
01:37:59,707 --> 01:38:01,470
- He knows all about this.
- All right.

819
01:38:03,043 --> 01:38:04,874
Son of a...

820
01:38:04,945 --> 01:38:06,708
Come here, you son of a bitch!

821
01:42:27,307 --> 01:42:28,740
Are you okay?

822
01:43:46,887 --> 01:43:48,479
Look what you did.

823
01:43:50,224 --> 01:43:53,318
You ruined my surprise ending!

824
01:43:53,393 --> 01:43:58,330
I gave you your part:
the witness.

825
01:43:58,398 --> 01:44:02,232
You were perfect.
You played it to a T.

826
01:44:02,302 --> 01:44:04,827
But that was it.

827
01:44:04,905 --> 01:44:06,338
End of part.

828
01:44:07,574 --> 01:44:09,508
Wrap Jake Scully.

829
01:44:13,213 --> 01:44:15,511
You had to play the hero...

830
01:44:15,582 --> 01:44:19,348
improvise all this crap
about finding a body double...

831
01:44:19,419 --> 01:44:22,013
and unmasking the Indian.

832
01:44:25,092 --> 01:44:27,754
But you didn't think it through.

833
01:44:27,828 --> 01:44:32,492
Sometimes heroes
come to tragic ends.

834
01:44:33,934 --> 01:44:37,529
What's the matter?
A little short of breath?

835
01:44:40,574 --> 01:44:42,269
What a terrible way to die.

836
01:44:43,710 --> 01:44:45,735
Especially when you're
so claustrophobic.

837
01:44:46,847 --> 01:44:48,280
Wait a minute.

838
01:44:48,348 --> 01:44:51,181
I'll give you another take.

839
01:44:53,520 --> 01:44:57,047
The only problem is
you've got to act.

840
01:45:03,363 --> 01:45:04,796
Come on.

841
01:45:05,465 --> 01:45:07,433
Action.

842
01:45:12,706 --> 01:45:14,139
And action.

843
01:45:22,349 --> 01:45:24,408
Cut. Get him out of here.
Move the camera out.

844
01:45:24,484 --> 01:45:26,816
Joe, give me a hand.
Jake, take it easy.

845
01:45:26,887 --> 01:45:28,878
What's going on?

846
01:45:28,955 --> 01:45:30,889
We're getting you out.
That's all right.

847
01:45:30,957 --> 01:45:32,891
We got you. Let go.
Don't worry about it.

848
01:45:32,959 --> 01:45:35,553
- Don't worry about nothing.
- It's all right. We're here.

849
01:45:35,629 --> 01:45:38,894
Give him some air.
Talk to me.

850
01:45:38,965 --> 01:45:42,196
Say something.
Walk it off. Just go for a walk.

851
01:45:42,269 --> 01:45:44,635
Just relax. Just breathe in.

852
01:45:44,705 --> 01:45:47,401
All right, that's good.
There you go.

853
01:45:47,474 --> 01:45:49,408
What's the matter, babe?

854
01:45:49,476 --> 01:45:53,105
Boy, you had us scared there.
What's the problem?

855
01:45:53,180 --> 01:45:55,114
Wait a minute.

856
01:45:59,653 --> 01:46:02,747
- Get away from me.
- Babe, just relax.

857
01:46:02,823 --> 01:46:04,916
- We're just trying to help you.
- I know.

858
01:46:04,991 --> 01:46:07,824
I can help myself.

859
01:46:07,894 --> 01:46:12,194
Listen, Scully,
why don't you cool off?

860
01:46:12,265 --> 01:46:15,894
Go on home,
and we'll shoot this another time.

861
01:46:15,969 --> 01:46:17,402
All right?

862
01:46:19,439 --> 01:46:21,600
Don't lie to me.

863
01:46:21,675 --> 01:46:23,939
If I don't get this shot,
you'll fire me.

864
01:46:25,712 --> 01:46:28,772
Don't be ridiculous.
Why would I do a thing like that?

865
01:46:36,056 --> 01:46:40,789
Save the speech, Rubin. I know all about
your personal commitment to the actors.

866
01:46:40,861 --> 01:46:44,456
I'm a little claustrophobic.
Youll work around it, right?

867
01:46:44,531 --> 01:46:46,465
Yeah, that's right.

868
01:46:50,470 --> 01:46:52,665
- I don't like your attitude.
- Yeah?

869
01:46:52,739 --> 01:46:56,175
If I get this shot,
you'll like it a lot better, right?

870
01:47:08,889 --> 01:47:10,322
Let's do it!

871
01:47:19,132 --> 01:47:21,623
You better get it right this time.

872
01:47:21,701 --> 01:47:24,363
You're one pain in the ass
I don't need.

873
01:47:26,573 --> 01:47:29,337
- Okay, Joe.
- Roll sound. Quiet.

874
01:47:29,409 --> 01:47:31,673
And action I

875
01:47:39,553 --> 01:47:41,020
You bastard!

876
01:47:41,087 --> 01:47:42,714
Don't be so melodramatic.

877
01:47:48,128 --> 01:47:49,686
Kill!

878
01:48:00,607 --> 01:48:02,768
What are you doing?

879
01:48:02,843 --> 01:48:05,471
- What am I doing? I'm saving you.
- From who?

880
01:48:05,545 --> 01:48:10,915
- From... The Indian was Sam Bouchard.
- Wait a minute.

881
01:48:10,984 --> 01:48:14,147
Am I missing something?
Is there somebody here that I don't see?

882
01:48:14,221 --> 01:48:16,382
Yes! The dog knocked him in.

883
01:48:16,456 --> 01:48:18,390
Come look. Come here.

884
01:48:19,593 --> 01:48:21,925
Look, he must have knocked him in.
He went...

885
01:48:21,995 --> 01:48:26,796
I thought it belonged to Gloria, but
it must have belonged to the husband.

886
01:48:26,867 --> 01:48:30,496
That's why he never barked at the Indian
when he tried to sneak in the house.

887
01:48:30,570 --> 01:48:33,266
I think you're absolutely right.
We should go to the police.

888
01:48:33,340 --> 01:48:35,740
- Really? You believe me?
- Yes. I believe you.

889
01:48:35,809 --> 01:48:39,336
I believe you are a number one sicko
and should be put away for life!

890
01:48:39,412 --> 01:48:41,710
I know all about you guys.

891
01:48:41,781 --> 01:48:44,750
I've seen about you
on late-night television.

892
01:48:44,818 --> 01:48:47,343
You're one of those necrophiliacs,
a corpse fucker!

893
01:48:47,420 --> 01:48:49,945
- I am not.
- Yes! I turn you on, all right.

894
01:48:50,023 --> 01:48:52,014
The only problem is that
I'm still moving!

895
01:48:52,092 --> 01:48:54,652
Unconscious is good,
but dead is better, right?

896
01:48:56,863 --> 01:48:58,296
Are you all right?

897
01:48:59,366 --> 01:49:00,799
Here, take my hand.

898
01:49:01,768 --> 01:49:03,633
Do not touch me.

899
01:49:03,703 --> 01:49:06,103
I'm not dead yet.

900
01:49:09,109 --> 01:49:14,137
I know this all seems crazy,
but I'm trying to help you.

901
01:49:14,214 --> 01:49:17,149
Are you gonna stay in there
for the rest of your life?

902
01:50:01,595 --> 01:50:03,529
Freeze.
Don't move your hand, Jake.

903
01:50:03,597 --> 01:50:05,189
- How does that look?
- It looks great.

904
01:50:05,265 --> 01:50:08,860
Good. Terrific. Hold that move.
Let's 86 the bat.

905
01:50:08,935 --> 01:50:12,200
That's a wrap on the bat.
Get the bat out.

906
01:50:12,272 --> 01:50:15,537
- I gotta hold the hand really still.
- Help him out.

907
01:50:15,609 --> 01:50:19,045
- Turn the water off.
- Can I slip out?

908
01:50:19,112 --> 01:50:22,377
Wait till we get the bar in there.
Wait till we get the stand in here.

909
01:50:22,449 --> 01:50:26,545
- Okay, sweetheart.
- Between the bottom two fingers.

910
01:50:30,957 --> 01:50:33,721
Good. Okay, sweetheart,
you can slide out.

911
01:50:33,793 --> 01:50:36,057
Don't move the hand.
Freeze the hand.

912
01:50:36,129 --> 01:50:38,063
Makeup.
Let's get a touch-up for Jake.

913
01:50:38,131 --> 01:50:40,565
Don't move the hand.
Keep the hand very still.

914
01:50:40,634 --> 01:50:42,226
Excuse me.

915
01:50:42,302 --> 01:50:44,236
Don't move the bar!

916
01:50:46,139 --> 01:50:47,902
- I'm sorry.
- Did the bar move?

917
01:50:47,974 --> 01:50:49,407
That's okay.

918
01:50:50,910 --> 01:50:53,743
- You're doing a great job.
- Did I flash the teeth long enough?

919
01:50:53,813 --> 01:50:57,249
Best teeth flashing I've ever seen.
It looked beautiful, babe.

920
01:50:57,317 --> 01:50:59,251
I'm so glad
I fired that other asshole.

921
01:50:59,319 --> 01:51:02,413
This part was made for you.
I mean it. You look sensational.

922
01:51:02,489 --> 01:51:05,583
- This bar is falling.
- That looks good.

923
01:51:05,659 --> 01:51:07,251
- You holding up?
- Yeah.

924
01:51:07,327 --> 01:51:09,921
Just a little longer.
Okay, girls, step out. Step back.

925
01:51:09,996 --> 01:51:11,930
Let's bring in the body double.

926
01:51:11,998 --> 01:51:14,592
- Thanks.
- The hair looks good.

927
01:51:14,668 --> 01:51:16,932
Is that as hot
as that water gets?

928
01:51:17,003 --> 01:51:18,937
Slide in there, sweetheart.

929
01:51:19,005 --> 01:51:21,769
- Don't move the bar. It's important.
- I know.

930
01:51:21,841 --> 01:51:24,605
Hi. I'm Mindy.
Pleased to meet you.

931
01:51:24,678 --> 01:51:27,772
- Nice to meet you.
- Listen, be very, very careful.

932
01:51:27,847 --> 01:51:29,940
My breasts are very tender.

933
01:51:30,016 --> 01:51:31,779
I've got my period.

934
01:51:33,019 --> 01:51:34,452
We good here?

935
01:51:36,523 --> 01:51:39,788
I'm gonna...
Just bring your body up like this.

936
01:51:39,859 --> 01:51:41,793
My hand is right here.
I can't move my hand.

937
01:51:41,861 --> 01:51:44,455
Keep your hand exactly still.
Let's shoot it.

938
01:51:44,531 --> 01:51:46,795
Let's slide the bar out.

939
01:51:46,866 --> 01:51:49,130
Drop the camera.
Let's get the camera down.

940
01:51:50,537 --> 01:51:53,131
Wait till we're in position.

941
01:51:53,206 --> 01:51:54,969
Can you bring your body
up to my hand?

942
01:51:59,546 --> 01:52:02,379
Quiet, please!
I'm trying to think.

943
01:52:16,563 --> 01:52:19,498
You're gonna get a lot of dates
when this comes out.

944
01:52:19,566 --> 01:52:21,158
Here we go. Action.

945
01:52:21,234 --> 01:52:22,826
Action with the hand.

946
01:52:25,739 --> 01:52:28,003
Great action.

947
01:52:28,074 --> 01:52:30,008
Is that too hard?
