00:00:14,931 --> 00:00:18,068
On behalf of everyone
aboard Sundancer Airlines,

2
00:00:18,103 --> 00:00:20,206
welcome to Snowflake, Montana.

3
00:00:20,241 --> 00:00:21,793
Happy holidays.
Candy cane for you.

4
00:00:21,827 --> 00:00:22,827
Thanks so much.

5
00:00:22,862 --> 00:00:24,113
- Thank you for flying with us.
- Thank you.

6
00:00:24,137 --> 00:00:25,448
One for you. Happy holidays.

7
00:00:25,482 --> 00:00:27,275
- Happy holidays.
- Happy holidays.

8
00:00:28,448 --> 00:00:31,000
I cannot believe it is just
over a week until Christmas

9
00:00:31,034 --> 00:00:32,689
and I still have so much to do.

10
00:00:32,724 --> 00:00:34,551
Well, you know what they say.

11
00:00:34,586 --> 00:00:35,769
If you want to get
something done,

12
00:00:35,793 --> 00:00:36,965
ask a busy person.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:37,931
Then don't be surprised

14
00:00:37,965 --> 00:00:39,862
if I ask you to find me
a busy person.

15
00:00:39,896 --> 00:00:40,931
Aw.

16
00:00:40,965 --> 00:00:43,000
Hey, Captain.

17
00:00:43,034 --> 00:00:44,896
We all heard about
the sale of the airline.

18
00:00:44,931 --> 00:00:46,148
Things won't be the same
around here

19
00:00:46,172 --> 00:00:47,310
without Sundancer.

20
00:00:47,344 --> 00:00:49,137
We had a good run, Colin.

21
00:00:49,172 --> 00:00:50,137
Don't you worry.

22
00:00:50,172 --> 00:00:51,827
I'm not going anywhere.

23
00:00:54,862 --> 00:00:57,241
It's okay, sweetheart.
Everything will be okay.

24
00:00:57,275 --> 00:00:59,034
First time flying?

25
00:00:59,068 --> 00:01:00,965
We're meeting
Lindy's grandparents in Seattle

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,044
before their Christmas cruise,

27
00:01:02,068 --> 00:01:03,448
and Lindy's a bit nervous.

28
00:01:03,482 --> 00:01:07,034
Of course, we have another
flight to Helena in a few days.

29
00:01:07,068 --> 00:01:08,275
Hi, Lindy.

30
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:09,344
I'm Captain Beckett.

31
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:11,310
Can I tell you a secret?

32
00:01:13,275 --> 00:01:15,379
The first time
that I got on an airplane,

33
00:01:15,413 --> 00:01:16,655
I was scared, too.

34
00:01:16,689 --> 00:01:17,724
Really?

35
00:01:17,758 --> 00:01:18,793
Really.

36
00:01:18,827 --> 00:01:21,448
But there are a lot
of brave people on board

37
00:01:21,482 --> 00:01:23,137
to make sure everybody is safe.

38
00:01:24,172 --> 00:01:26,275
I think I know a way
to make you feel brave.

39
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:32,034
Wow!

40
00:01:32,068 --> 00:01:35,379
I am appointing you
junior assistant co-pilot,

41
00:01:35,413 --> 00:01:37,137
in charge of anyone you see
feeling nervous.

42
00:01:37,172 --> 00:01:39,724
It's your job to teach them
to breathe like this.

43
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,034
Perfect.

44
00:01:48,103 --> 00:01:49,206
Merry Christmas!

45
00:01:49,241 --> 00:01:50,241
Thank you.

46
00:01:52,137 --> 00:01:53,586
She was so nice.

47
00:01:56,275 --> 00:01:57,344
Morning, Joe.

48
00:01:57,379 --> 00:01:59,034
Any messages for me?

49
00:01:59,068 --> 00:02:00,551
Thanks.

50
00:02:01,689 --> 00:02:03,527
[ma Aw, this place is never
going to be the same again.

51
00:02:03,551 --> 00:02:04,965
So many memories.

52
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,793
We'll make new memories, too.

53
00:02:06,827 --> 00:02:08,965
Just because you sold Sundancer
to Connor Airways

54
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,724
doesn't mean
anything has to change.

55
00:02:10,758 --> 00:02:13,379
We'll just be flying
for a new boss.

56
00:02:13,413 --> 00:02:14,586
You know, back when

57
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:17,655
your Grandma Nellie
launched the airline in '68,

58
00:02:17,689 --> 00:02:19,655
no one thought
this had any legs...

59
00:02:19,689 --> 00:02:21,758
Or, I should say, wings.

60
00:02:21,793 --> 00:02:23,034
But instead,

61
00:02:23,068 --> 00:02:25,103
she and Mom put Sundancer
and the town of Snowflake

62
00:02:25,137 --> 00:02:26,310
on the map.

63
00:02:26,344 --> 00:02:28,344
That'll never go away
because we have a new owner.

64
00:02:29,517 --> 00:02:31,137
So what's he like?

65
00:02:31,172 --> 00:02:33,034
- Matt Hansen?
- Mm-hmm.

66
00:02:33,068 --> 00:02:34,655
Connor Airlines' CEO.

67
00:02:34,689 --> 00:02:37,241
Uh, he's a very smart guy

68
00:02:37,275 --> 00:02:38,241
with an incredible
head for business,

69
00:02:38,275 --> 00:02:39,241
as far as I can tell.

70
00:02:39,275 --> 00:02:40,275
But, Dad,

71
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:42,068
what's he like personally?

72
00:02:42,103 --> 00:02:43,896
If I have any hope
of working with the guy,

73
00:02:43,931 --> 00:02:45,010
I'd like to know who he is.

74
00:02:45,034 --> 00:02:48,137
Well, I found him
a little stiff,

75
00:02:48,172 --> 00:02:49,827
maybe a little hard to read,

76
00:02:49,862 --> 00:02:50,931
but you know what?

77
00:02:50,965 --> 00:02:52,405
I could have caught him
on a bad day.

78
00:02:54,413 --> 00:02:55,827
Hey, sis.
Who are we talking about?

79
00:02:55,862 --> 00:02:57,034
Matt Hansen.

80
00:02:57,068 --> 00:03:01,034
Connor Airlines' CEO
is coming out for a visit.

81
00:03:01,068 --> 00:03:02,827
Mr. Warm and Fuzzy,
Party of None?

82
00:03:02,862 --> 00:03:04,551
I hear he's so tightly wound

83
00:03:04,586 --> 00:03:06,206
that he wears
three-piece pajamas to bed.

84
00:03:06,241 --> 00:03:07,931
He's just flying in

85
00:03:07,965 --> 00:03:09,793
to see how we do things
first-hand.

86
00:03:09,827 --> 00:03:11,355
Oh, so we should all be
on our best behavior.

87
00:03:11,379 --> 00:03:13,965
Oh, then you might want
to clean up your cluttered desk

88
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,482
so that
his first impression of you

89
00:03:15,517 --> 00:03:17,482
isn't that you're scattered
and disorganized.

90
00:03:17,517 --> 00:03:18,793
Me?

91
00:03:18,827 --> 00:03:21,275
Sundancer Airlines'
marketing genius?

92
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:23,103
Oh, and has the genius

93
00:03:23,137 --> 00:03:25,000
finally finished designing

94
00:03:25,034 --> 00:03:27,241
the loyalty program
for our frequent flyers?

95
00:03:31,068 --> 00:03:32,482
♪ Dashing through the snow

96
00:03:32,517 --> 00:03:34,310
♪ In a one-horse open sleigh

97
00:03:34,344 --> 00:03:35,965

♪ Ha-ha-ha-ha...

100
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,551
Nothing seems to faze that boy.

101
00:03:40,586 --> 00:03:41,620
Tell me about it.

102
00:03:41,655 --> 00:03:44,206
How is it that I inherited
your worry gene

103
00:03:44,241 --> 00:03:46,620
and he got Mom's
happy-go-lucky nature?

104
00:03:47,689 --> 00:03:48,655
And what about you, sweetie?

105
00:03:48,689 --> 00:03:50,448
When are you going
to find someone special?

106
00:03:50,482 --> 00:03:52,137
It's been five years
since your divorce.

107
00:03:52,172 --> 00:03:54,793
Dad, we have been through this.

108
00:03:54,827 --> 00:03:58,965
I'm just not ready to dip my toe
back in the dating pond.

109
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,379
Not ready, or maybe not willing?

110
00:04:03,758 --> 00:04:05,551
Look, I'm sorry, Jenny.

111
00:04:05,586 --> 00:04:06,931
I know it's none of my business.

112
00:04:06,965 --> 00:04:10,448
I just think that you deserve
to find your happily ever after.

113
00:04:10,482 --> 00:04:12,413
I am happy.

114
00:04:12,448 --> 00:04:13,827
And you worry too much.

115
00:04:18,413 --> 00:04:19,596
Thanks to everyone at Sundancer,

116
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:20,724
it looks like we'll be able

117
00:04:20,758 --> 00:04:21,827
to add three more kids

118
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:23,965
to this year's
Santa's Flight charity event.

119
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,655
'Tis the season
to be generous, right?

120
00:04:25,689 --> 00:04:27,241
Mm-hmm.

121
00:04:27,275 --> 00:04:28,241
Wow!

122
00:04:28,275 --> 00:04:30,275
You didn't tell me
he was such a looker.

123
00:04:31,275 --> 00:04:32,793
- Who?
- Matt Hansen.

124
00:04:33,931 --> 00:04:35,310
He was just profiled
in NW Media.

125
00:04:35,344 --> 00:04:36,448
They ranked him third

126
00:04:36,482 --> 00:04:38,413
of the most successful CEOs
under 40.

127
00:04:38,448 --> 00:04:39,965
What else does it say about him?

128
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,310
Um...

129
00:04:41,344 --> 00:04:42,137
hmm...

130
00:04:42,172 --> 00:04:43,379
dee-dee-dee-dee-doo...

131
00:04:43,413 --> 00:04:45,620
Oh! He made his mark
in mergers and acquisitions

132
00:04:45,655 --> 00:04:46,620
and has a knack

133
00:04:46,655 --> 00:04:48,482
for turning struggling airlines
profitable

134
00:04:48,517 --> 00:04:50,793
by cutting out the fat.

135
00:04:50,827 --> 00:04:51,758
Great.

136
00:04:51,793 --> 00:04:53,137
So he's a numbers guy?

137
00:04:54,172 --> 00:04:55,344
Am I going to lose my job?

138
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:56,896
Because I really love
working here.

139
00:04:56,931 --> 00:04:58,482
No, of course not.

140
00:04:58,517 --> 00:04:59,448
Why would you even say that?

141
00:04:59,482 --> 00:05:01,448
Well, come on, Jenny.

142
00:05:01,482 --> 00:05:02,862
A new owner is all about change.

143
00:05:02,896 --> 00:05:04,034
Like it or not,

144
00:05:04,068 --> 00:05:05,286
all our jobs
may be up in the air.

145
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:06,275
Yeah, well,

146
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:08,965
I plan to stay on
as head of operations,

147
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,103
so all changes
will have to go through me.

148
00:05:11,137 --> 00:05:12,562
Now let's get back
to Santa's Flight.

149
00:05:12,586 --> 00:05:13,551
Hey, sis.

150
00:05:13,586 --> 00:05:15,344
Hey, Megan.

151
00:05:19,103 --> 00:05:20,689
What, no kiss?

152
00:05:20,724 --> 00:05:22,172
Since when did you two get shy

153
00:05:22,206 --> 00:05:23,896
about public displays
of affection?

154
00:05:23,931 --> 00:05:25,724
Oh, uh...

155
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:26,965
we're just a little nervous

156
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,275
about the new owner's
rules on employees dating.

157
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:30,448
What?

158
00:05:30,482 --> 00:05:31,941
You guys have been together
for almost three years.

159
00:05:31,965 --> 00:05:33,241
It will be fine.

160
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,310
Oh, I'll get it.

161
00:05:41,448 --> 00:05:42,448
Yep.

162
00:05:45,896 --> 00:05:47,068
Hi.

163
00:05:55,517 --> 00:05:57,482
Is this where we wait
for visitor parking?

164
00:05:57,517 --> 00:05:59,137
Uh, yeah.

165
00:05:59,172 --> 00:06:01,724
Car rental, employee parking,
visitor parking.

166
00:06:01,758 --> 00:06:03,310
Thanks.

167
00:06:12,965 --> 00:06:14,482
Welcome to Snowflake.

168
00:06:17,862 --> 00:06:19,620
Yes. Yes, I just landed.

169
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,068
Evening, Sam.

170
00:06:22,103 --> 00:06:24,310
I'm staying
at the Snowflake Inn.

171
00:06:25,206 --> 00:06:28,931
So in case this town has
shoddy cell service...

172
00:06:28,965 --> 00:06:30,034
Excuse me.

173
00:06:30,068 --> 00:06:31,034
The board
can reach me directly there.

174
00:06:31,068 --> 00:06:32,068
Thank you.

175
00:06:34,241 --> 00:06:35,206
Whoops!

176
00:06:35,241 --> 00:06:36,758
Slow your roll, pal.

177
00:06:36,793 --> 00:06:38,073
Or at least buy me dinner first.

178
00:06:40,965 --> 00:06:41,965
Excuse me.

179
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:44,620
I was kidding.

180
00:06:52,793 --> 00:06:53,689
It seems like I'm still

181
00:06:53,724 --> 00:06:55,241
getting my feet
back on the ground.

182
00:06:56,655 --> 00:06:57,655
Hmm.

183
00:07:07,517 --> 00:07:08,757
Did you fly Sundancer Airlines?

184
00:07:10,241 --> 00:07:12,000
Private charter, actually.

185
00:07:13,758 --> 00:07:15,000
How nice for you.

186
00:07:16,275 --> 00:07:17,655
Bad for the environment, though.

187
00:07:17,689 --> 00:07:19,379
And all the muddy
carbon footprint

188
00:07:19,413 --> 00:07:21,000
you left in the sky.

189
00:07:22,172 --> 00:07:24,372
Next time, you should consider
Sundancer business class.

190
00:07:34,689 --> 00:07:36,413
Well...

191
00:07:36,448 --> 00:07:37,803
it seems like
this sparkly conversation

192
00:07:37,827 --> 00:07:39,000
has come to an end.

193
00:07:45,241 --> 00:07:46,206
Have a nice life.

194
00:07:46,241 --> 00:07:47,793
You too.

195
00:07:50,172 --> 00:07:51,172
Bye, Sam.

196
00:07:52,137 --> 00:07:53,448
All my love to your wife.

197
00:08:04,896 --> 00:08:07,551
Happy, happy holidays!

198
00:08:07,586 --> 00:08:10,275
You must be Mr. Hansen
from Connor Airlines.

199
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:11,827
I'm Sue,

200
00:08:11,862 --> 00:08:13,206
and I'm under strict orders

201
00:08:13,241 --> 00:08:16,793
to put our extra-special VIP
in our finest suite.

202
00:08:16,827 --> 00:08:18,655
Honestly, I'm so exhausted
from the flight,

203
00:08:18,689 --> 00:08:19,655
any room will be fine.

204
00:08:19,689 --> 00:08:22,103
How does
the honeymoon suite sound?

205
00:08:22,137 --> 00:08:25,655
It's got a big, comfy
queen-sized bed,

206
00:08:25,689 --> 00:08:27,310
memory-foam mattress,

207
00:08:27,344 --> 00:08:28,620
expanded mini-bar,

208
00:08:28,655 --> 00:08:29,758
rainfall shower...

209
00:08:29,793 --> 00:08:30,793
I'll take it.

210
00:08:35,689 --> 00:08:38,034
I don't see a wedding ring,

211
00:08:38,068 --> 00:08:42,413
so I assume there's
no Mrs. Hansen joining you?

212
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,586
Single?

213
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:45,620
Divorced?

214
00:08:45,655 --> 00:08:47,137
Widower, perhaps?

215
00:08:47,172 --> 00:08:48,103
Oh, you poor...

216
00:08:48,137 --> 00:08:49,448
Sue, I'm not a widower.

217
00:08:49,482 --> 00:08:53,344
I'm simply a weary traveler
looking for a place to rest.

218
00:08:54,517 --> 00:08:55,793
Why didn't you say so?

219
00:08:57,827 --> 00:08:58,827
Follow me.

220
00:08:58,862 --> 00:09:00,448
In case you haven't noticed,

221
00:09:00,482 --> 00:09:04,034
we in Snowflake take the season
rather seriously around here.

222
00:09:04,068 --> 00:09:05,379
I'll say.

223
00:09:05,413 --> 00:09:08,379
Who was your last guest,
Mr. and Mrs. Claus?

224
00:09:08,413 --> 00:09:11,103
We pride ourselves
in making guests feel at home.

225
00:09:12,758 --> 00:09:14,827
It's... lovely.

226
00:09:14,862 --> 00:09:17,137
And that's a bakery basket
from the Beckett family.

227
00:09:17,172 --> 00:09:21,034
And I am sure Jenny Beckett
would love to show you around

228
00:09:21,068 --> 00:09:22,965
and tell you all about
Santa's Flight.

229
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Ooh!

230
00:09:28,103 --> 00:09:29,103
Oh!

231
00:09:40,275 --> 00:09:43,310
Chloe, dinner
was incredible as always.

232
00:09:43,344 --> 00:09:45,241
Thanks.

233
00:09:46,931 --> 00:09:48,413
So...

234
00:09:48,448 --> 00:09:49,344
have you thought any more

235
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:50,413
about what colleges

236
00:09:50,448 --> 00:09:51,665
you plan on applying to
in the spring?

237
00:09:51,689 --> 00:09:54,068
Not since last night,
when you asked me at dinner.

238
00:09:54,103 --> 00:09:55,482
I told you, Mom.

239
00:09:55,517 --> 00:09:57,079
I'm just not sure
college is right for me.

240
00:09:57,103 --> 00:09:59,379
Hey, it doesn't mean
it's wrong for you, either.

241
00:09:59,413 --> 00:10:02,000
College is about
discovering who you are.

242
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:04,379
Right.

243
00:10:04,413 --> 00:10:05,931
Oh, well, homework time.

244
00:10:12,241 --> 00:10:13,586
Oh, hey! Careful.

245
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,172
Grandma's collection
is irreplaceable.

246
00:10:16,137 --> 00:10:17,655
Oh!

247
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:19,896
Hey, Charlie.

248
00:10:19,931 --> 00:10:21,320
I didn't watch Survivoryet.
No spoilers.

249
00:10:21,344 --> 00:10:23,034
Um, actually,

250
00:10:23,068 --> 00:10:24,217
I was calling
to see how you're doing.

251
00:10:24,241 --> 00:10:25,379
I'm fine.

252
00:10:25,413 --> 00:10:26,620
Why would you ask?

253
00:10:26,655 --> 00:10:29,034
Uh, because
you're probably sitting at home,

254
00:10:29,068 --> 00:10:30,034
twirling your hair right now,

255
00:10:30,068 --> 00:10:31,241
and I know that

256
00:10:31,275 --> 00:10:33,241
you only do that
when you're very anxious.

257
00:10:35,103 --> 00:10:36,896
It relaxes me for some reason,

258
00:10:36,931 --> 00:10:38,000
but I will be fine

259
00:10:38,034 --> 00:10:39,137
as soon as Matt Hansen

260
00:10:39,172 --> 00:10:40,724
flies back
to wherever he came from.

261
00:10:42,655 --> 00:10:43,620
Um, hey,

262
00:10:43,655 --> 00:10:45,103
on that train of thought,

263
00:10:45,137 --> 00:10:46,275
I was thinking of maybe

264
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:47,907
taking Dad down to the tavern
sometime this week,

265
00:10:47,931 --> 00:10:48,896
cheer him up a bit?

266
00:10:48,931 --> 00:10:50,413
With his retirement so close,

267
00:10:50,448 --> 00:10:52,448
he hasn't really
been himself lately.

268
00:10:52,482 --> 00:10:54,000
I think the reality

269
00:10:54,034 --> 00:10:56,413
of the sale
of Sundancer Airlines

270
00:10:56,448 --> 00:10:58,413
is starting to sink in.

271
00:10:58,448 --> 00:10:59,379
That's great.

272
00:10:59,413 --> 00:11:00,458
Why don't you set something up,

273
00:11:00,482 --> 00:11:02,000
and bring Megan, of course.

274
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:05,965
Hey.

275
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,413
Hey, Charlie?

276
00:11:08,448 --> 00:11:10,586
Is something going on
between you two?

277
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,965
You both seemed
a little distant today.

278
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,206
Uh, yeah, yeah.

279
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:17,931
We weren't going to tell anyone
until after New Year's, though,

280
00:11:17,965 --> 00:11:19,724
but we broke up.

281
00:11:19,758 --> 00:11:21,137
What?

282
00:11:21,172 --> 00:11:22,896
Really?

283
00:11:22,931 --> 00:11:24,331
You both seemed
to be doing so well.

284
00:11:25,172 --> 00:11:27,068
Yeah, well,

285
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,631
Megan was really
talking about marriage,

286
00:11:28,655 --> 00:11:29,965
and I'm not ready yet.

287
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,482
And because my "yet"

288
00:11:32,517 --> 00:11:33,769
doesn't seem to have
an end date,

289
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:34,758
we decided to split up.

290
00:11:34,793 --> 00:11:38,103
Charlie, you're not ready yet?

291
00:11:38,137 --> 00:11:39,310
She's fantastic.

292
00:11:39,344 --> 00:11:40,310
What are you waiting for?

293
00:11:40,344 --> 00:11:43,344
You have to get it toge...

294
00:11:43,379 --> 00:11:44,689
Okay. You know what?

295
00:11:44,724 --> 00:11:46,113
It is none of my business.
I'm sorry.

296
00:11:46,137 --> 00:11:47,724
Thank you.

297
00:11:47,758 --> 00:11:51,000
And hey, between you and me,
just keep this under your hat.

298
00:11:51,034 --> 00:11:53,068
Okay. Will do.

299
00:11:53,103 --> 00:11:54,310
Love you. Bye.

300
00:11:56,137 --> 00:11:57,413
Charlie handles our marketing,

301
00:11:57,448 --> 00:11:58,758
and for the past two years,

302
00:11:58,793 --> 00:12:00,517
my daughter, Jenny,

303
00:12:00,551 --> 00:12:02,827
has phased her duties
from piloting planes

304
00:12:02,862 --> 00:12:04,103
into management.

305
00:12:04,137 --> 00:12:05,379
Okay, morning, guys.

306
00:12:05,413 --> 00:12:07,079
I don't know if Matt Hansen
is a black-no-sugar-coffee guy

307
00:12:07,103 --> 00:12:08,379
or an almond-milk-latte guy,

308
00:12:08,413 --> 00:12:10,448
or one of those
frou-frou city snobs...

309
00:12:10,482 --> 00:12:11,620
Black is perfect.

310
00:12:13,758 --> 00:12:15,478
Wait. Aren't you the lap guy
from yesterday?

311
00:12:16,275 --> 00:12:17,241
- Lap guy?
- Lap guy?

312
00:12:17,275 --> 00:12:18,875
I thought
you were arriving this morning.

313
00:12:19,827 --> 00:12:21,103
I decided to fly up early.

314
00:12:21,137 --> 00:12:22,862
I see.

315
00:12:27,448 --> 00:12:28,689
Let's chat in the boardroom.

316
00:12:32,137 --> 00:12:33,137
Yeah!

317
00:12:34,413 --> 00:12:36,103
I'm here to assess operations

318
00:12:36,137 --> 00:12:37,275
and identify how best

319
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:39,344
to streamline
and incorporate Sundancer

320
00:12:39,379 --> 00:12:40,896
under the Connor Airways'
umbrella.

321
00:12:40,931 --> 00:12:43,862
And Matt plans
to expand Connor Airlines

322
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:45,793
by beginning
flying international

323
00:12:45,827 --> 00:12:47,379
come the new year.

324
00:12:47,413 --> 00:12:48,655
Wow, international.

325
00:12:48,689 --> 00:12:49,620
Wow, you think big.

326
00:12:49,655 --> 00:12:50,965
Always.

327
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,413
And, bit by bit,

328
00:12:52,448 --> 00:12:53,896
things are finally
coming together.

329
00:12:53,931 --> 00:12:56,241
And what exactly
does "streamline" entail?

330
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:58,113
Oh, you don't have to worry
about that at this point.

331
00:12:58,137 --> 00:13:00,010
That's for me and
my executive team to determine.

332
00:13:00,034 --> 00:13:01,896
Oh, I assumed
I'd be part of the team.

333
00:13:01,931 --> 00:13:03,482
I'm sorry.

334
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:05,689
It was always my intention

335
00:13:05,724 --> 00:13:09,517
that Jenny would remain on
in a management role.

336
00:13:09,551 --> 00:13:11,448
I mean,
given all of her experience

337
00:13:11,482 --> 00:13:12,734
both in the air
and on the ground,

338
00:13:12,758 --> 00:13:14,827
she's the perfect person
to oversee things.

339
00:13:16,068 --> 00:13:17,103
I see.

340
00:13:17,137 --> 00:13:19,241
I'm afraid I can't commit
to that at this moment.

341
00:13:19,275 --> 00:13:20,206
I assure you

342
00:13:20,241 --> 00:13:21,424
I am more than qualified
for the position.

343
00:13:21,448 --> 00:13:23,034
I have no doubt.

344
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:24,551
However, as the new CEO,

345
00:13:24,586 --> 00:13:25,517
it will be my recommendation
to the board

346
00:13:25,551 --> 00:13:27,275
that really matters.

347
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:29,034
But I promise
to keep you in the mix.

348
00:13:30,896 --> 00:13:33,793
If you'll excuse me,
I have a small fire to put out.

349
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,344
And an even bigger one
when he gets back.

350
00:13:40,379 --> 00:13:41,344
Keep me in the mix?

351
00:13:41,379 --> 00:13:43,241
He met me for two minutes.

352
00:13:43,275 --> 00:13:44,241
Nobody knows how things
work around Sundancer

353
00:13:44,275 --> 00:13:45,241
better than Jenny does.

354
00:13:45,275 --> 00:13:46,379
I'm sorry, sweetie.

355
00:13:46,413 --> 00:13:47,551
I assumed that

356
00:13:47,586 --> 00:13:49,758
I made my intentions very clear
with the sale.

357
00:13:49,793 --> 00:13:51,034
It's fine, Dad.

358
00:13:51,068 --> 00:13:53,228
I just have to prove to him
that I am best for the job.

359
00:13:58,793 --> 00:14:00,448
Oh, that was a quick fire.

360
00:14:02,206 --> 00:14:03,482
Yes.

361
00:14:03,517 --> 00:14:04,482
Would one of you be able

362
00:14:04,517 --> 00:14:05,596
to give me a tour
of the terminal?

363
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,413
I thought you'd never ask.

364
00:14:09,586 --> 00:14:11,413
Here are just
some starter ideas.

365
00:14:11,448 --> 00:14:13,103
Okay.

366
00:14:16,068 --> 00:14:18,586
Wait, you want to cut
employee birthday parties?

367
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:19,620
Unnecessary cost.

368
00:14:19,655 --> 00:14:20,758
And the recognition awards?

369
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:21,862
Also unnecessary costs.

370
00:14:21,896 --> 00:14:23,758
I respectfully disagree.

371
00:14:23,793 --> 00:14:25,206
You can't put a price on morale.

372
00:14:25,241 --> 00:14:26,206
Yes, you can.

373
00:14:26,241 --> 00:14:27,458
You do a once-a-month
birthday cake,

374
00:14:27,482 --> 00:14:29,413
save on cost and calories.

375
00:14:29,448 --> 00:14:31,068
And you can replace
your soccer trophies

376
00:14:31,103 --> 00:14:32,793
with an "employee of the month"
placard.

377
00:14:32,827 --> 00:14:34,044
Okay, they are not
soccer trophies.

378
00:14:34,068 --> 00:14:35,448
They're recognition awards.

379
00:14:35,482 --> 00:14:36,448
Benjamin, slow down.

380
00:14:36,482 --> 00:14:38,241
Sorry.

381
00:14:38,275 --> 00:14:40,355
He has the day off of school,
and I couldn't find a sitter.

382
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:41,896
Oh, Mr. Hansen,

383
00:14:41,931 --> 00:14:45,103
this is Hayley in maintenance,
and her son, Benjamin...

384
00:14:45,137 --> 00:14:46,172
Or as I like to call him,

385
00:14:46,206 --> 00:14:48,241
our honorary Sundancer employee.

386
00:14:48,275 --> 00:14:49,241
Always welcome.

387
00:14:49,275 --> 00:14:51,103
I came to deliver
my wish to Santa.

388
00:14:51,137 --> 00:14:52,896
You're right on time.

389
00:14:52,931 --> 00:14:54,379
We were just about to make...

390
00:14:54,413 --> 00:14:56,931
Send the list to the North Pole.

391
00:14:56,965 --> 00:14:58,689
Okay, Benjamin.

392
00:14:58,724 --> 00:15:00,655
Why don't we let the adults
get back to work,

393
00:15:00,689 --> 00:15:02,289
and you can go watch
the planes take off.

394
00:15:03,724 --> 00:15:04,827
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

395
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:08,251
Miss Beckett, it's just
with costs hemorrhaging,

396
00:15:08,275 --> 00:15:09,620
what I need in the VP role

397
00:15:09,655 --> 00:15:11,803
is someone who's not afraid
of making the tough decisions.

398
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:13,000
I see.

399
00:15:13,034 --> 00:15:14,034
And what, you think

400
00:15:14,068 --> 00:15:15,389
because this is
a family-run business

401
00:15:15,413 --> 00:15:16,586
that I'm not capable?

402
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:19,758
I can be cutthroat and ruthless
when I need to be.

403
00:15:21,862 --> 00:15:23,793
Sorry to interrupt.

404
00:15:23,827 --> 00:15:25,113
Jenny, I'm on
with Santa's Market,

405
00:15:25,137 --> 00:15:26,941
and they want to confirm
our Santa's Flight reservation.

406
00:15:26,965 --> 00:15:28,700
Sue mentioned something
about that at the hotel.

407
00:15:28,724 --> 00:15:29,689
What is that, exactly?

408
00:15:29,724 --> 00:15:31,379
It's our annual
Christmas tradition

409
00:15:31,413 --> 00:15:32,965
the airline hosts on the 23rd.

410
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,448
We take under-served children
in the area

411
00:15:35,482 --> 00:15:37,103
and their families
on a fantasy trip

412
00:15:37,137 --> 00:15:39,379
to Santa's Market
in Idaho Falls.

413
00:15:39,413 --> 00:15:41,448
First, we serve
an in-flight lunch with Santa,

414
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:42,689
and then, after we land,

415
00:15:42,724 --> 00:15:44,148
the kids spend the day
in the village,

416
00:15:44,172 --> 00:15:45,655
they open
their wish-list presents...

417
00:15:46,896 --> 00:15:48,034
Sounds nice.

418
00:15:48,068 --> 00:15:49,206
Sounds expensive.

419
00:15:49,241 --> 00:15:51,724
Well, it's worth it
once you see the kids' faces.

420
00:15:51,758 --> 00:15:52,758
Pure magic.

421
00:15:52,793 --> 00:15:53,976
I didn't see a line item for it.

422
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,551
Oh, um...

423
00:15:55,586 --> 00:15:56,793
it's under community outreach.

424
00:15:58,482 --> 00:15:59,527
I'm afraid
until we can find ways

425
00:15:59,551 --> 00:16:00,896
to increase profit margins,

426
00:16:00,931 --> 00:16:02,034
we've got no choice

427
00:16:02,068 --> 00:16:04,206
but to put a pin in
extraneous charitable efforts.

428
00:16:06,965 --> 00:16:08,896
Meaning you want to ground
Santa's Flight?

429
00:16:09,827 --> 00:16:10,907
You're catching on quickly.

430
00:16:11,827 --> 00:16:13,068
Will that be a problem?

431
00:16:14,482 --> 00:16:15,965
You're the boss.

432
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,448
And yes, that will be a problem.

433
00:16:30,758 --> 00:16:31,872
Look, I don't know what's worse.

434
00:16:31,896 --> 00:16:33,793
Matt's ego or his arrogance.

435
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:35,551
He's walking around
like he owns the place.

436
00:16:35,586 --> 00:16:36,862
Well, technically, sis, he does.

437
00:16:36,896 --> 00:16:39,172
I don't care
if he owns the North Pole.

438
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:41,724
Santa's Flight is more important
than his precious budget.

439
00:16:41,758 --> 00:16:42,931
Yes, I agree,

440
00:16:42,965 --> 00:16:44,896
but are you sure you want
to be rocking the boat?

441
00:16:44,931 --> 00:16:46,620
You and Matt
are not necessarily besties.

442
00:16:46,655 --> 00:16:48,896
But when I didn't flinch
at canceling Santa's Flight,

443
00:16:48,931 --> 00:16:50,379
that seemed to impress him.

444
00:16:50,413 --> 00:16:51,586
Well, good.

445
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:52,586
I meant to ask,

446
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:53,941
what's next
to clinch the big promotion?

447
00:16:53,965 --> 00:16:54,976
Are you going to fire
the flight crew

448
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,896
before Christmas?

449
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:57,586
This is not about
my promotion, okay?

450
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:59,010
I only agreed
to ground Santa's Flight

451
00:16:59,034 --> 00:17:00,310
because I had no other option.

452
00:17:00,344 --> 00:17:01,620
Right. So you're not giving up?

453
00:17:01,655 --> 00:17:03,620
Thank you.

454
00:17:03,655 --> 00:17:04,872
Not even if I have to conjure up

455
00:17:04,896 --> 00:17:06,631
the ghost of Christmas past,
present, and future

456
00:17:06,655 --> 00:17:07,965
to make it happen.

457
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,562
Well, if you're hoping
to change Matt's mind,

458
00:17:09,586 --> 00:17:11,506
you might be barking up
the wrong Christmas tree.

459
00:17:12,758 --> 00:17:14,172
You know, you're right.

460
00:17:14,206 --> 00:17:15,172
If we're going to do this,

461
00:17:15,206 --> 00:17:16,217
we're going to have to do it
ourselves.

462
00:17:16,241 --> 00:17:18,586
Everyone else in Snowflake
loves the event.

463
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,734
I'd hate to see it
go by the wayside.

464
00:17:19,758 --> 00:17:22,655
Maybe that's it.

465
00:17:22,689 --> 00:17:24,827
What if we canvass
local businesses in the area

466
00:17:24,862 --> 00:17:26,241
to help us sponsor the event?

467
00:17:26,275 --> 00:17:28,965
Their donations
will help us defer costs.

468
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,172
They can buy toys
and purchase plane tickets.

469
00:17:31,206 --> 00:17:32,517
Yeah, anything's possible,

470
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:33,941
but we'd have to raise
a lot of money

471
00:17:33,965 --> 00:17:34,862
in a short amount of time.

472
00:17:34,896 --> 00:17:36,241
Well, failure isn't an option.

473
00:17:36,275 --> 00:17:37,931
Okay, okay.
I'll get the snowball rolling.

474
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,275
You must be Matt.

475
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:48,379
My mom just called

476
00:17:48,413 --> 00:17:49,344
to say she's on her way
to meet with you.

477
00:17:49,379 --> 00:17:50,448
I'm Chloe.

478
00:17:50,482 --> 00:17:52,275
I didn't know
her daughter worked here, too.

479
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:53,551
A real family affair.

480
00:17:53,586 --> 00:17:55,724
I have a part-time
work-study at high school.

481
00:17:55,758 --> 00:17:57,896
Do you plan on getting
into aviation like your mom?

482
00:17:57,931 --> 00:17:59,896
No.

483
00:17:59,931 --> 00:18:01,931
Or any part
of the family business.

484
00:18:01,965 --> 00:18:04,310
I'm not sure what I want to do,
to be honest.

485
00:18:04,344 --> 00:18:06,172
Well, look at it this way.

486
00:18:06,206 --> 00:18:07,206
You're halfway there.

487
00:18:07,241 --> 00:18:08,689
Halfway there?

488
00:18:08,724 --> 00:18:10,793
I have no idea
what I want to do with my life.

489
00:18:10,827 --> 00:18:12,947
Yeah, but at least you know
what you don't want to do.

490
00:18:15,965 --> 00:18:17,758
Oh, I see
you've met my daughter.

491
00:18:17,793 --> 00:18:18,896
Yes.

492
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,458
Are those the maintenance
reports I requested?

493
00:18:20,482 --> 00:18:21,896
Yes.

494
00:18:21,931 --> 00:18:23,251
If you like, I can give you
a tour of the planes.

495
00:18:23,275 --> 00:18:24,379
The planes.

496
00:18:24,413 --> 00:18:25,413
Excellent.

497
00:18:30,827 --> 00:18:32,448
This is Cecilia,

498
00:18:32,482 --> 00:18:35,758
named after Cecilia Aragon,

499
00:18:35,793 --> 00:18:38,241
one of the champion
aerobatic pilots.

500
00:18:40,379 --> 00:18:42,660
Don't tell me you have names
for every one of your planes.

501
00:18:44,482 --> 00:18:45,931
We do.

502
00:18:45,965 --> 00:18:48,827
It's our way of honoring
female pioneers of aviation.

503
00:18:49,793 --> 00:18:51,393
So I'm guessing
you really love it, then.

504
00:18:52,068 --> 00:18:53,758
Flying?

505
00:18:53,793 --> 00:18:55,586
I do.

506
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,517
I mean, I did.

507
00:18:57,551 --> 00:18:59,586
The duties
of managing the airline

508
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:02,275
have grounded me
more than I like.

509
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:04,275
But taking over
the reins from my dad

510
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,586
has always been my goal.

511
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:06,931
- Someday.
- Makes sense.

512
00:19:06,965 --> 00:19:08,517
What about you?

513
00:19:08,551 --> 00:19:10,241
Have you always had
a passion for business?

514
00:19:11,551 --> 00:19:12,911
Only child
of an investment banker.

515
00:19:13,931 --> 00:19:15,734
As a kid, I remember
the only subject that I liked

516
00:19:15,758 --> 00:19:17,448
almost as much as it liked me
was math.

517
00:19:17,482 --> 00:19:19,310
How can a subject like you?

518
00:19:20,344 --> 00:19:21,493
Because there's only
one right answer.

519
00:19:21,517 --> 00:19:22,931
Ah.

520
00:19:22,965 --> 00:19:23,931
And as a kid,

521
00:19:23,965 --> 00:19:25,758
tucked away in boarding school,

522
00:19:25,793 --> 00:19:28,965
I suppose I found
something reassuring about that.

523
00:19:30,724 --> 00:19:32,275
I've never thought about it
like that.

524
00:19:33,827 --> 00:19:36,034
You have to realize, though,
when it comes to business,

525
00:19:36,068 --> 00:19:37,908
there can always be
more than one right answer.

526
00:19:38,793 --> 00:19:40,033
Well, I haven't been wrong yet.

527
00:19:42,275 --> 00:19:43,275
There's always a first.

528
00:19:48,068 --> 00:19:49,379
Would you like to see some more?

529
00:19:50,413 --> 00:19:52,068
This way.

530
00:19:52,103 --> 00:19:53,931
We understand
times are tight, yes,

531
00:19:53,965 --> 00:19:56,551
but every dollar counts.

532
00:19:56,586 --> 00:19:59,620
So I can put you down for $5.00.

533
00:19:59,655 --> 00:20:01,517
I see you took me literally.

534
00:20:01,551 --> 00:20:03,482
Well, thank you
for your generosity.

535
00:20:03,517 --> 00:20:04,551
Bye.

536
00:20:04,586 --> 00:20:06,206
It sounds like

537
00:20:06,241 --> 00:20:09,172
Snowflake Plumbing
is in the toilet.

538
00:20:09,206 --> 00:20:10,448
From now on,

539
00:20:10,482 --> 00:20:13,000
I'm going to start saying
every hundred dollars counts.

540
00:20:16,034 --> 00:20:17,068
Hey, Megs,

541
00:20:17,103 --> 00:20:18,103
I just wanted to say

542
00:20:18,137 --> 00:20:21,000
thanks again
for coming out to dinner

543
00:20:21,034 --> 00:20:23,034
to help cheer up Dad tonight.

544
00:20:23,068 --> 00:20:25,862
I know that playing pretend
isn't exactly fun.

545
00:20:25,896 --> 00:20:27,931
No, but it's a whole lot better

546
00:20:27,965 --> 00:20:30,724
than the ruin the holidays
for the friends and family tour.

547
00:20:31,931 --> 00:20:33,172
Come January,

548
00:20:33,206 --> 00:20:34,217
we really need
to rip off the Band-Aid

549
00:20:34,241 --> 00:20:35,241
and let everyone know.

550
00:20:37,413 --> 00:20:38,379
We could also...

551
00:20:38,413 --> 00:20:39,793
This is Megan.

552
00:20:41,482 --> 00:20:42,724
Good evening, everyone.

553
00:20:42,758 --> 00:20:44,620
It is my great pleasure

554
00:20:44,655 --> 00:20:45,862
to announce the return

555
00:20:45,896 --> 00:20:48,448
of our live
holiday entertainment.

556
00:20:48,482 --> 00:20:51,275
Everyone, please give it up
for Silver Wings.

557
00:20:52,275 --> 00:20:53,655
Whoo!

558
00:20:55,724 --> 00:20:56,724
Charlie!

559
00:21:00,931 --> 00:21:03,586
♪ Dashing through the snow

560
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:07,586
♪ In a one-horse open sleigh

561
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:10,413
♪ O'er the fields we go

562
00:21:10,448 --> 00:21:14,068
♪ Laughing all the way

563
00:21:14,103 --> 00:21:17,172
From garage band
to center stage.

564
00:21:17,206 --> 00:21:18,517
What are the chances?

565
00:21:18,551 --> 00:21:19,689
The moment

566
00:21:19,724 --> 00:21:21,206
my regularly-scheduled band
canceled,

567
00:21:21,241 --> 00:21:22,517
I immediately thought

568
00:21:22,551 --> 00:21:24,551
of calling your brother
to step in.

569
00:21:24,586 --> 00:21:26,551
Well, for Charlie,
this is like a dream come true.

570
00:21:27,724 --> 00:21:28,965
And Christine was kind enough

571
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,517
to have the tavern sponsor
two kids for Santa's Flight.

572
00:21:31,551 --> 00:21:32,586
Wow...

573
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:33,769
Christine, that is so generous.
Thank you.

574
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:35,413
Please. It is my pleasure.

575
00:21:35,448 --> 00:21:36,620
I look forward to seeing

576
00:21:36,655 --> 00:21:39,103
those precious faces light up
like a Christmas tree.

577
00:21:41,448 --> 00:21:42,689
Frank...

578
00:21:42,724 --> 00:21:44,241
it is good to see you.

579
00:21:44,275 --> 00:21:45,620
You haven't been out in a while.

580
00:21:45,655 --> 00:21:47,275
Uh, no.

581
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:49,931
I'm married to my job,
and she doesn't let me out much.

582
00:21:49,965 --> 00:21:51,931
Well, I imagine
all that will change

583
00:21:51,965 --> 00:21:53,241
now that you're retired.

584
00:21:53,275 --> 00:21:54,586
I suspect you're right.

585
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:57,103
We're going to have to find you
a hobby to keep you busy.

586
00:22:08,241 --> 00:22:09,724
Uh, I thought

587
00:22:09,758 --> 00:22:13,310
Matt was very clear
Santa's Flight was canceled.

588
00:22:13,344 --> 00:22:14,344
Yes.

589
00:22:14,379 --> 00:22:15,655
We're just exploring options

590
00:22:15,689 --> 00:22:18,793
to keep Santa's Flight on course
through private donations.

591
00:22:18,827 --> 00:22:20,517
Well, it's never a good idea

592
00:22:20,551 --> 00:22:22,448
to go behind
someone's back, Jenny.

593
00:22:22,482 --> 00:22:23,896
It's got the potential
to backfire

594
00:22:23,931 --> 00:22:24,896
and explode in your face.

595
00:22:24,931 --> 00:22:27,793
Well, we're not using
any company funds,

596
00:22:27,827 --> 00:22:29,655
so, technically,

597
00:22:29,689 --> 00:22:30,941
there's no back
we're going behind.

598
00:22:30,965 --> 00:22:33,793
Besides, isn't it our job
to keep Mom's dream alive

599
00:22:33,827 --> 00:22:35,241
and keep Santa's Flight
on course

600
00:22:35,275 --> 00:22:36,620
for the sake of the kids?

601
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:45,413
- Mm-mm.
- Yes.

602
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:48,448
Fine.

603
00:22:56,965 --> 00:22:58,896
I never suspected
you to be a barfly.

604
00:22:58,931 --> 00:23:01,275
I'm just here
to pick up some takeout.

605
00:23:02,931 --> 00:23:04,517
Is that your brother onstage?

606
00:23:06,344 --> 00:23:07,862
Before he worked for Sundancer,

607
00:23:07,896 --> 00:23:09,344
he got a degree in music theory.

608
00:23:09,379 --> 00:23:10,448
It's his real passion.

609
00:23:10,482 --> 00:23:12,000
They actually sound
pretty decent.

610
00:23:12,034 --> 00:23:13,068
They do, don't they?

611
00:23:13,103 --> 00:23:14,551
♪ ...Ride and sing

612
00:23:14,586 --> 00:23:17,241
♪ A sleighing song tonight

613
00:23:18,379 --> 00:23:21,586
♪ Jingle bells, jingle bells

614
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:23,034
♪ Jingle all the way...

615
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:24,448
If you'd like some company,

616
00:23:24,482 --> 00:23:25,882
you're more than welcome
to join us.

617
00:23:26,931 --> 00:23:28,034
Oh, thank you,

618
00:23:28,068 --> 00:23:29,631
but I still have to finalize
my year-end review

619
00:23:29,655 --> 00:23:31,379
and present it to the board.

620
00:23:31,413 --> 00:23:32,379
Don't you have
an accounting department

621
00:23:32,413 --> 00:23:33,413
for that?

622
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:35,379
Yes.

623
00:23:35,413 --> 00:23:36,413
But I like to review

624
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:37,458
and be hands-on
with the process.

625
00:23:37,482 --> 00:23:38,586
Of course you do.

626
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:39,862
Isn't it tiring

627
00:23:39,896 --> 00:23:42,241
spending your life looking over
everyone's shoulder?

628
00:23:42,275 --> 00:23:43,379
I guess you can say

629
00:23:43,413 --> 00:23:44,424
I'm a guy who likes to have

630
00:23:44,448 --> 00:23:46,000
his hand on the wheel
at all times.

631
00:23:46,034 --> 00:23:47,194
That's why we have co-pilots.

632
00:23:48,068 --> 00:23:49,275
It can be fun for a change

633
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:51,413
to let someone else
fly the plane.

634
00:23:53,241 --> 00:23:55,896
I guess I'll just have
to take your word for it.

635
00:23:55,931 --> 00:23:58,448
Good night.

636
00:23:58,482 --> 00:24:01,689
He really is a good time
never waiting to happen.

637
00:24:01,724 --> 00:24:02,724
Ugh.

638
00:24:14,551 --> 00:24:17,275
You looked like you were having
a great time up there.

639
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:18,517
I was, actually.

640
00:24:18,551 --> 00:24:20,482
Dad's right.

641
00:24:20,517 --> 00:24:23,206
And you found a fan
in Matt Hansen.

642
00:24:23,241 --> 00:24:25,034
What? No way.

643
00:24:25,068 --> 00:24:26,182
Okay, that is
the Snowflake equivalent

644
00:24:26,206 --> 00:24:27,379
of a Grammy Award.

645
00:24:27,413 --> 00:24:30,275
All work and no play
makes Matt a dull boss.

646
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:31,424
Oh, Charlie,
can you put together

647
00:24:31,448 --> 00:24:33,793
some ideas for
our seniors' discount campaign?

648
00:24:33,827 --> 00:24:34,896
Yeah. Sure thing.

649
00:24:36,413 --> 00:24:37,620
I'll be back.

650
00:24:49,206 --> 00:24:51,551
I don't see how we can reduce
the budget by 10%

651
00:24:51,586 --> 00:24:53,862
without forcing us
to downsize personnel.

652
00:24:53,896 --> 00:24:55,413
It's not your worry
anymore, Dad.

653
00:24:55,448 --> 00:24:56,965
It's mine, remember?

654
00:25:00,068 --> 00:25:01,275
Look at you.

655
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:04,103
Right on time, as per usual.

656
00:25:04,137 --> 00:25:07,724
I wish our flights
were as prompt as you are.

657
00:25:07,758 --> 00:25:08,689
Really?

658
00:25:08,724 --> 00:25:10,004
Why wasn't I aware
of this issue?

659
00:25:10,034 --> 00:25:11,286
Delays in departure
and arrival times

660
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:13,068
have a negative impact on...

661
00:25:13,103 --> 00:25:14,206
Matt, she was joking.

662
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:17,413
Ha-hah!

663
00:25:21,482 --> 00:25:24,413
So, as you can see,
right over here,

664
00:25:24,448 --> 00:25:27,896
most of our flights
are around the tri-state area.

665
00:25:27,931 --> 00:25:30,275
Your busiest hub appears to be
the Helena airport?

666
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:31,724
- Mm-hmm.
- So why is HQ here?

667
00:25:31,758 --> 00:25:34,896
Snowflake is where
my grandma founded Sundancer,

668
00:25:34,931 --> 00:25:35,896
and besides,

669
00:25:35,931 --> 00:25:37,286
it's where
most of our employees live.

670
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:39,896
As quaint as that sounds,

671
00:25:39,931 --> 00:25:42,103
my executives need to see
the bigger picture.

672
00:25:45,241 --> 00:25:47,931
What's going on with this flight
from Snowflake to Idaho Falls?

673
00:25:47,965 --> 00:25:49,355
Barely any seats have sold
on the 23rd.

674
00:25:49,379 --> 00:25:50,631
Why don't we combine it
with another option?

675
00:25:50,655 --> 00:25:52,172
No! No.

676
00:25:52,206 --> 00:25:54,034
This is a regular
stream of commuters

677
00:25:54,068 --> 00:25:55,172
from a local factory

678
00:25:55,206 --> 00:25:56,482
that always book last minute.

679
00:25:56,517 --> 00:25:58,758
So why don't we capitalize
on that fact and raise fares?

680
00:26:00,448 --> 00:26:02,344
Uh, say,

681
00:26:02,379 --> 00:26:05,034
why don't you let Jenny
drive you downtown?

682
00:26:05,068 --> 00:26:06,734
She can introduce you to some
of our local advertisers.

683
00:26:06,758 --> 00:26:08,793
I have a conference call
later this afternoon,

684
00:26:08,827 --> 00:26:11,896
but I suppose a little fresh air
will do me good.

685
00:26:11,931 --> 00:26:13,241
Mm-hmm. Let's go.

686
00:26:14,448 --> 00:26:16,862
Hey, merry Christmas, you guys.

687
00:26:16,896 --> 00:26:18,344
Happy holidays to the family.

688
00:26:18,379 --> 00:26:19,931
Okay, this is our toy store.

689
00:26:19,965 --> 00:26:21,862
They display ads
on our overhead screens

690
00:26:21,896 --> 00:26:23,034
on a regular basis.

691
00:26:23,068 --> 00:26:25,482
Oh, and if you need
any last-minute Christmas gifts,

692
00:26:25,517 --> 00:26:27,758
they have a wonderful selection.

693
00:26:27,793 --> 00:26:29,241
Well, my assistant handles

694
00:26:29,275 --> 00:26:30,758
annual corporate
gift certificates.

695
00:26:30,793 --> 00:26:32,172
Right, the personal touch.

696
00:26:32,206 --> 00:26:33,689
- Hey, Jenny.
- Hi.

697
00:26:33,724 --> 00:26:35,458
I've been putting
some toys aside for Santa...

698
00:26:35,482 --> 00:26:36,527
That's great. That's great, Ann,

699
00:26:36,551 --> 00:26:37,517
and this is Matt Hansen.

700
00:26:37,551 --> 00:26:39,551
Matt, Ann's son

701
00:26:39,586 --> 00:26:41,044
is a baggage handler for us
on weekends.

702
00:26:41,068 --> 00:26:42,965
- Pleasure to meet you.
- You as well.

703
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,413
Happy holidays!

704
00:26:44,448 --> 00:26:45,551
Happy holidays.

705
00:26:45,586 --> 00:26:48,068
Do you know everybody's story?

706
00:26:48,103 --> 00:26:49,517
Not everybody.

707
00:26:49,551 --> 00:26:51,310
I wouldn't exactly call you
an open book.

708
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:54,448
Although I suspect
there's more going on

709
00:26:54,482 --> 00:26:57,482
underneath the whole
Brooks Brothers facade.

710
00:26:58,655 --> 00:27:00,310
Tell you what. Need a recharge?

711
00:27:00,344 --> 00:27:01,862
Fine. But make it fast.

712
00:27:01,896 --> 00:27:03,862
Hi. Two peppermint lattes,
please.

713
00:27:03,896 --> 00:27:05,241
Black coffee
will be fine for me.

714
00:27:05,275 --> 00:27:06,379
Oh, come on.

715
00:27:06,413 --> 00:27:07,862
It's my treat.

716
00:27:07,896 --> 00:27:09,044
Do something a little bit
out of your comfort zone.

717
00:27:09,068 --> 00:27:10,241
They're tasty.

718
00:27:11,551 --> 00:27:13,172
Fine.

719
00:27:13,206 --> 00:27:14,206
Light on the peppermint.

720
00:27:17,206 --> 00:27:20,206
So the theater
runs in-flight ads as well?

721
00:27:20,241 --> 00:27:21,724
The opposite.

722
00:27:21,758 --> 00:27:24,413
We advertise our promotions
before movie trailers.

723
00:27:25,379 --> 00:27:27,379
I used to take Chloe here
when she was a kid.

724
00:27:27,413 --> 00:27:29,965
She used to love
seeing the family logo

725
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,620
on the big screen.

726
00:27:31,655 --> 00:27:32,655
Ah-hah.

727
00:27:32,689 --> 00:27:34,034
The circle of life.

728
00:27:34,068 --> 00:27:35,206
Mm-hmm.

729
00:27:35,241 --> 00:27:37,034
And Chloe's dad?

730
00:27:37,068 --> 00:27:38,413
Divorced.

731
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:41,034
We married young,

732
00:27:41,068 --> 00:27:43,172
had Chloe young, grew apart.

733
00:27:43,206 --> 00:27:44,931
Mostly, I think
he couldn't stand

734
00:27:44,965 --> 00:27:46,448
the heat of being
with the captain.

735
00:27:46,482 --> 00:27:47,448
Mm-hmm.

736
00:27:47,482 --> 00:27:48,620
What about you?

737
00:27:48,655 --> 00:27:50,172
Divorced.

738
00:27:50,206 --> 00:27:51,793
Death by work ethic?

739
00:27:53,206 --> 00:27:55,275
Any regrets?

740
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:56,965
Only one.

741
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,281
Should have bought Tesla stock
when it broke $200 a share.

742
00:28:03,448 --> 00:28:04,448
What?

743
00:28:07,413 --> 00:28:08,379
Never mind.

744
00:28:08,413 --> 00:28:09,965
No, really. What's so funny?

745
00:28:11,965 --> 00:28:13,862
I just, you know,

746
00:28:13,896 --> 00:28:15,700
keep trying to peel back
the layers of the onion

747
00:28:15,724 --> 00:28:18,206
just to find
some soft, gushy side.

748
00:28:18,241 --> 00:28:20,551
But really, you're just
a hopeless pragmatic.

749
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:25,147
Sorry. That was
for Captain Jenny.

750
00:28:26,793 --> 00:28:28,310
Cover me! Or not.

751
00:28:29,482 --> 00:28:30,275
Benjamin...

752
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:31,310
I'm gonna get you!

753
00:28:31,344 --> 00:28:32,379
Hey!

754
00:28:32,413 --> 00:28:33,413
Here it comes!

755
00:28:35,965 --> 00:28:36,965
Hey!

756
00:28:40,551 --> 00:28:41,517
Okay, okay.

757
00:28:41,551 --> 00:28:42,896
Truce!

758
00:28:42,931 --> 00:28:45,034
Truce. Truce.

759
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:48,275
You win. You win.

760
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:50,034
You remember, Benjamin.
This is Matt.

761
00:28:50,068 --> 00:28:51,655
Are you Captain Jenny's
boyfriend?

762
00:28:52,827 --> 00:28:54,068
Wh... No, silly.

763
00:28:54,103 --> 00:28:55,448
He's my boss.

764
00:28:57,724 --> 00:28:58,804
Come on, Benjamin. Let's go.

765
00:29:00,206 --> 00:29:01,275
Bye. Bye.

766
00:29:03,551 --> 00:29:04,551
Bye.

767
00:29:08,724 --> 00:29:09,965
Your first snowball fight?

768
00:29:10,931 --> 00:29:12,137
How did you know that was...

769
00:29:13,137 --> 00:29:14,137
That obvious, huh?

770
00:29:15,827 --> 00:29:17,551
Must be an offshoot
of being an only child.

771
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,551
That's rough.

772
00:29:20,586 --> 00:29:22,551
I'm so grateful
my parents adopted Charlie.

773
00:29:22,586 --> 00:29:23,724
He's like my best friend.

774
00:29:23,758 --> 00:29:26,310
My heart goes out
to all the adoptive parents,

775
00:29:26,344 --> 00:29:28,000
the single mothers.

776
00:29:28,034 --> 00:29:29,474
I think Hayley is
a great foster mom.

777
00:29:32,448 --> 00:29:33,562
But she really shouldn't
bring Benjamin to work with her.

778
00:29:33,586 --> 00:29:34,827
We're not running a daycare.

779
00:29:41,827 --> 00:29:43,034
Right...

780
00:30:08,448 --> 00:30:10,551
She shoots, she scores!

781
00:30:10,586 --> 00:30:12,793
What? What's all the whoo-hooing
going on in here?

782
00:30:12,827 --> 00:30:14,482
I volunteered
to create a website

783
00:30:14,517 --> 00:30:17,172
for people to start donating
to Santa's Flight.

784
00:30:17,206 --> 00:30:18,793
I put in profiles

785
00:30:18,827 --> 00:30:21,068
of all the children
we're trying to sponsor

786
00:30:21,103 --> 00:30:23,448
as well as gift wish lists
for people to help donate.

787
00:30:23,482 --> 00:30:24,551
Chloe, you did all this?

788
00:30:24,586 --> 00:30:25,931
Yeah. Why?

789
00:30:25,965 --> 00:30:27,620
This is amazing.

790
00:30:27,655 --> 00:30:29,275
It shows genuine talent.

791
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:30,275
Thanks.

792
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:31,830
You know, you really
should consider...

793
00:30:34,275 --> 00:30:36,034
that you have such a gift.

794
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,172
Thanks, Chloe.

795
00:30:38,206 --> 00:30:42,068
This website will really help
make our goal a reality.

796
00:30:42,103 --> 00:30:43,103
So...

797
00:30:43,137 --> 00:30:45,068
how are you and Matt
getting along?

798
00:30:45,103 --> 00:30:46,206
Fine.

799
00:30:46,241 --> 00:30:48,896
If you can stand
the constant windchill factor.

800
00:30:48,931 --> 00:30:50,596
It's like one second
he seems like an adult,

801
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:51,758
and the next

802
00:30:51,793 --> 00:30:53,965
he acts like a calculator
in a three-piece suit.

803
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,413
Well, maybe you just
haven't found his number.

804
00:30:58,965 --> 00:31:00,034
You have to admit, though,

805
00:31:00,068 --> 00:31:01,551
he is kind of cute.

806
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:04,862
No. Show me this.

807
00:31:11,241 --> 00:31:12,448
Oh.

808
00:31:12,482 --> 00:31:15,241
I must not have gotten the memo
about casual Friday.

809
00:31:15,275 --> 00:31:16,379
Oh.

810
00:31:16,413 --> 00:31:17,596
I figured this might be
more fitting attire

811
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:18,724
in case I find myself

812
00:31:18,758 --> 00:31:20,758
in the throes of another
rogue snowball fight.

813
00:31:23,413 --> 00:31:25,241
That's funny.

814
00:31:25,275 --> 00:31:26,551
Okay.

815
00:31:26,586 --> 00:31:28,079
Well, I just finished meeting
with your engineering team,

816
00:31:28,103 --> 00:31:29,620
and I'm happily impressed.

817
00:31:31,068 --> 00:31:32,310
Whoa.

818
00:31:32,344 --> 00:31:34,034
Was that a genuine compliment?

819
00:31:34,068 --> 00:31:35,103
Now I'm impressed.

820
00:31:35,137 --> 00:31:37,724
Jenny, I'm sorry
if you got the idea

821
00:31:37,758 --> 00:31:39,551
my purpose here
was simply to find flaws.

822
00:31:39,586 --> 00:31:40,586
Can you say that again?

823
00:31:41,655 --> 00:31:42,803
I'm here to see
the full picture.

824
00:31:42,827 --> 00:31:44,965
No, the part
where you apologized.

825
00:31:47,965 --> 00:31:49,965
See, now you really
should do that more often.

826
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,275
What, apologize?

827
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:53,724
Smile.

828
00:31:53,758 --> 00:31:55,044
You know, you don't have
to go around all the time

829
00:31:55,068 --> 00:31:57,827
with a look on your face
like a balloon payment is due.

830
00:31:58,931 --> 00:32:00,689
I'll put that on my to-do list.

831
00:32:00,724 --> 00:32:02,103
Right after I get back
from Helena

832
00:32:02,137 --> 00:32:03,344
to check out their facility.

833
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:04,689
What for?

834
00:32:04,724 --> 00:32:06,079
I thought you were here
to visit and tour our operation.

835
00:32:06,103 --> 00:32:08,044
In case you haven't noticed,
I like to be thorough.

836
00:32:08,068 --> 00:32:09,620
You're going to waste
so much time

837
00:32:09,655 --> 00:32:10,793
driving to and from Helena.

838
00:32:10,827 --> 00:32:12,734
I'm covering the route
three different times today.

839
00:32:12,758 --> 00:32:14,241
I can fly you in and out.

840
00:32:14,275 --> 00:32:15,206
Nobody gets hurt.

841
00:32:15,241 --> 00:32:16,931
No! I mean, I really
don't mind driving.

842
00:32:16,965 --> 00:32:18,517
I find it relaxing.

843
00:32:18,551 --> 00:32:20,689
But it can take hours
in either direction,

844
00:32:20,724 --> 00:32:21,689
and that's if you're lucky.

845
00:32:21,724 --> 00:32:23,517
I get a lot
of brainstorming done

846
00:32:23,551 --> 00:32:25,034
on the road.

847
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:26,517
It's meditative.

848
00:32:26,551 --> 00:32:27,689
Don't be ridiculous.

849
00:32:27,724 --> 00:32:29,896
You said you wanted
to see the full picture,

850
00:32:29,931 --> 00:32:31,724
and you have seen
everything we do

851
00:32:31,758 --> 00:32:34,482
except for the whole point
of an airline...

852
00:32:34,517 --> 00:32:35,620
the actual flights.

853
00:32:35,655 --> 00:32:36,620
That settles it.

854
00:32:36,655 --> 00:32:37,655
Settles what?

855
00:32:39,103 --> 00:32:40,655
I'm making
my first executive decision.

856
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,379
Come on!

857
00:32:45,068 --> 00:32:46,793
Welcome aboard
Sundancer flight 83.

858
00:32:46,827 --> 00:32:49,068
We are en route
from Snowflake to Helena.

859
00:32:49,103 --> 00:32:51,241
The flying time
is just under an hour,

860
00:32:51,275 --> 00:32:54,896
and we've got clear skies
and a frosty 28 degrees.

861
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:56,655
Buckle up and enjoy the ride.

862
00:32:59,172 --> 00:33:00,551
Hey, mister.

863
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:03,862
Are you nervous about flying?

864
00:33:05,137 --> 00:33:06,068
A little.

865
00:33:06,103 --> 00:33:08,000
I used to be scared of flying

866
00:33:08,034 --> 00:33:11,034
until Captain Beckett
gave me these.

867
00:33:12,482 --> 00:33:13,724
If you start to feel scared,

868
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:14,758
just breathe.

869
00:33:24,655 --> 00:33:25,724
You're doing good.

870
00:33:36,758 --> 00:33:38,558
Yes, that's his coat.
Thanks, Molly. I got it.

871
00:33:40,655 --> 00:33:42,551
Oh, here you go.

872
00:33:42,586 --> 00:33:43,551
Great flight.

873
00:33:43,586 --> 00:33:44,620
Put me right to sleep.

874
00:33:44,655 --> 00:33:46,000
Uh-huh.

875
00:33:46,034 --> 00:33:47,724
I'll pick you back up at 4:30.

876
00:33:58,793 --> 00:34:00,482
Hey. Everything okay?

877
00:34:00,517 --> 00:34:01,448
Yeah.

878
00:34:01,482 --> 00:34:02,527
Just have a few routine
safety checks

879
00:34:02,551 --> 00:34:03,758
to do out on the tarmac,

880
00:34:03,793 --> 00:34:06,206
and Benjamin is going to be
my apprentice again.

881
00:34:06,241 --> 00:34:07,586
Right, mister?

882
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,034
Actually...

883
00:34:10,068 --> 00:34:11,620
would it be okay

884
00:34:11,655 --> 00:34:14,413
if Benjamin joins me
for my last trip of the day?

885
00:34:14,448 --> 00:34:15,968
I promise
I'll have him home by dinner.

886
00:34:18,482 --> 00:34:19,413
That sounds great.

887
00:34:19,448 --> 00:34:20,413
Yeah!

888
00:34:20,448 --> 00:34:22,275
Let's go, Benjamin.

889
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,620
Have fun.

890
00:34:27,758 --> 00:34:29,241
Blue skies on the way back.

891
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:30,586
No turbulence. We'll be good.

892
00:34:32,551 --> 00:34:34,034
Oh, welcome back aboard.

893
00:34:34,068 --> 00:34:35,424
How was your inspection
here in Helena?

894
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:37,241
I got the information I needed.

895
00:34:37,275 --> 00:34:38,344
Good.

896
00:34:38,379 --> 00:34:39,769
Oh, so you know,
you won't be traveling alone.

897
00:34:39,793 --> 00:34:41,241
Hayley had to work late,

898
00:34:41,275 --> 00:34:44,379
but Benjamin will be joining us
as our special VIP guest.

899
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:48,940
- Have a nice flight.
- Thank you.

900
00:34:59,482 --> 00:35:01,448
Mr. Hansen, this is
my 14th time on a plane.

901
00:35:01,482 --> 00:35:03,034
Isn't that cool?

902
00:35:03,068 --> 00:35:04,931
Uh-huh.

903
00:35:04,965 --> 00:35:05,965
Super-cool.

904
00:35:07,758 --> 00:35:09,000
Hello, fliers.

905
00:35:09,034 --> 00:35:10,320
Please ensure that
your seat belts are buckled

906
00:35:10,344 --> 00:35:12,275
and your tray tables
are in the upright position

907
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:14,172
as we taxi on the runway.
Thank you.

908
00:35:14,206 --> 00:35:18,034
Sometimes, I like to sit back
and pretend I'm the pilot.

909
00:35:18,068 --> 00:35:19,103
Want to be my co-pilot?

910
00:35:26,275 --> 00:35:27,275
Sure.

911
00:35:42,586 --> 00:35:43,896
Hello, folks.

912
00:35:43,931 --> 00:35:46,758
We have now reached
our maximum cruising altitude.

913
00:35:46,793 --> 00:35:50,448
It is a gorgeous, sunny day
on all sides of the aircraft.

914
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:52,034
So, please, sit back, relax,

915
00:35:52,068 --> 00:35:54,724
and enjoy flying
with Sundancer Airlines.

916
00:35:54,758 --> 00:35:56,586
I'm an only child, too.

917
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:58,034
It's okay.
You'll get used to it.

918
00:35:58,068 --> 00:36:00,137
And you can make
lots of friends.

919
00:36:00,172 --> 00:36:01,965
Like the friends
who ambushed me downtown?

920
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,172
Yeah.

921
00:36:03,206 --> 00:36:04,965
We got you
and Captain Jenny good.

922
00:36:06,586 --> 00:36:08,217
I can't wait to tell them
I got to fly today.

923
00:36:08,241 --> 00:36:09,620
Flying's my favorite.

924
00:36:09,655 --> 00:36:12,551
I know everything there is
to know about airplanes.

925
00:36:12,586 --> 00:36:14,103
I own this airline now.

926
00:36:14,137 --> 00:36:15,857
So I could probably tell you
a thing or two.

927
00:36:16,655 --> 00:36:18,517
This plane's an Avro RJ 100.

928
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:20,310
It seats 100 passengers,

929
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:21,965
two pilots,
and one flight attendant,

930
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,137
and it has turbofan engines.

931
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:25,793
Wow. You weren't kidding.

932
00:36:26,793 --> 00:36:27,907
I'm going to be a pilot
when I grow up,

933
00:36:27,931 --> 00:36:29,137
just like Captain Jenny.

934
00:36:29,172 --> 00:36:30,413
Huh.

935
00:36:30,448 --> 00:36:32,482
Did you know the wingspan
is 86 feet long?

936
00:36:33,517 --> 00:36:35,551
I did not.

937
00:36:35,586 --> 00:36:36,931
But now I do.

938
00:36:40,965 --> 00:36:42,103
No.

939
00:36:42,137 --> 00:36:43,734
Christine doesn't have
a thing for my dad.

940
00:36:43,758 --> 00:36:47,793
Oh, I could spot the signals
a mile away.

941
00:36:47,827 --> 00:36:52,103
But your dad either seems
oblivious or unwilling, so...

942
00:36:52,137 --> 00:36:53,803
I mean, honestly,
it's probably a bit of both.

943
00:36:53,827 --> 00:36:55,793
After my mom passed away,

944
00:36:55,827 --> 00:36:57,907
I kind of thought he hung up
the dating hat for good.

945
00:36:58,793 --> 00:37:01,517
Maybe it's time he dusts it off.

946
00:37:01,551 --> 00:37:04,000
Oh, you're not really thinking
about playing Cupid, are you?

947
00:37:04,034 --> 00:37:05,965
Why not?

948
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,355
With you and I
keeping up appearances,

949
00:37:07,379 --> 00:37:08,551
it might be fun

950
00:37:08,586 --> 00:37:10,026
to help somebody else
find happiness.

951
00:37:12,413 --> 00:37:13,379
Hello, folks.

952
00:37:13,413 --> 00:37:14,493
We are on our final descent.

953
00:37:14,517 --> 00:37:16,103
We will be
on the ground shortly.

Hey, look at you,
out on a school night.

963
00:37:59,586 --> 00:38:01,310
I suppose so.

964
00:38:01,344 --> 00:38:03,241
Dad's always needling me
to go out more.

965
00:38:03,275 --> 00:38:04,793
And he's right.

966
00:38:05,724 --> 00:38:08,034
Oh, is that your hot date?

967
00:38:08,068 --> 00:38:10,551
It's more like my new boss.

968
00:38:10,586 --> 00:38:12,241
Um, hello.

969
00:38:12,275 --> 00:38:14,034
Christine, this is Matt Hansen.

970
00:38:14,068 --> 00:38:15,413
So you are the villain

971
00:38:15,448 --> 00:38:17,137
who's been shaking things up
at Sundancer?

972
00:38:17,172 --> 00:38:18,172
Yes.

973
00:38:18,206 --> 00:38:19,389
I'm here to burn off
a little steam

974
00:38:19,413 --> 00:38:20,482
after putting pink slips

975
00:38:20,517 --> 00:38:23,034
in the stockings
of some of my employees.

976
00:38:23,068 --> 00:38:24,034
He's joking.

977
00:38:24,068 --> 00:38:25,241
Wait. You're joking, right?

978
00:38:27,655 --> 00:38:28,976
You're just here
to pick up takeout.

979
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,379
Actually, I was hoping
to dine in

980
00:38:30,413 --> 00:38:32,551
rather than spend another meal
stuck in my hotel room.

981
00:38:32,586 --> 00:38:33,793
Oh, I'm sorry.

982
00:38:33,827 --> 00:38:36,310
I am afraid that all
of my tables are booked.

983
00:38:36,344 --> 00:38:40,068
Unless Jenny doesn't mind
you sharing her table.

984
00:38:40,103 --> 00:38:41,586
Oh, um, sure. Yeah.

985
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:42,586
Yeah, that works.

986
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:44,620
Great. Right this way.

987
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:46,413
This way.

988
00:38:48,965 --> 00:38:55,379
♪ And a happy new year

989
00:39:09,379 --> 00:39:11,344
I just think
men can be oblivious,

990
00:39:11,379 --> 00:39:12,586
you know, sometimes,

991
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:14,965
when it comes to reading signals
from the opposite sex.

992
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,103
Oh, I suppose,

993
00:39:16,137 --> 00:39:19,034
but you and Charlie
hit it off right away.

994
00:39:19,068 --> 00:39:21,034
Please.

995
00:39:21,068 --> 00:39:23,448
He was completely oblivious

996
00:39:23,482 --> 00:39:25,793
I had a crush on him
when we first met.

997
00:39:25,827 --> 00:39:27,931
I mean, I had to practically
hit him over the head

998
00:39:27,965 --> 00:39:29,241
to get him to ask me out.

999
00:39:29,275 --> 00:39:30,310
Oh, come on.

1000
00:39:30,344 --> 00:39:31,862
I do not believe that
for a minute.

1001
00:39:31,896 --> 00:39:33,241
You two make the perfect pair.

1002
00:39:33,275 --> 00:39:35,482
I can see that you are
the yin to his yang.

1003
00:39:36,793 --> 00:39:39,275
That's what I thought
when we first met.

1004
00:39:43,034 --> 00:39:44,689
Just out of curiosity, Megan,

1005
00:39:44,724 --> 00:39:46,084
why are you telling me
all of this?

1006
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,724
Well, I saw how you were
with Frank last night.

1007
00:39:49,758 --> 00:39:51,965
And if you think he has

1008
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,413
the potential to be
the yin to your yang,

1009
00:39:54,448 --> 00:39:55,448
you need to be direct.

1010
00:40:04,862 --> 00:40:05,758
Don't take this the wrong way,

1011
00:40:05,793 --> 00:40:07,103
but...

1012
00:40:07,137 --> 00:40:08,758
I actually had fun today.

1013
00:40:10,103 --> 00:40:12,551
That's really nice.

1014
00:40:12,586 --> 00:40:14,241
And a little surprising.

1015
00:40:14,275 --> 00:40:15,689
You knew, didn't you?

1016
00:40:15,724 --> 00:40:18,206
About my apprehension
with flying?

1017
00:40:18,241 --> 00:40:20,000
I managed to put
the pieces together.

1018
00:40:21,068 --> 00:40:22,620
But isn't it a little bit ironic

1019
00:40:22,655 --> 00:40:24,793
that you enjoy
running an airline?

1020
00:40:25,793 --> 00:40:28,517
I think it's like a moth
being drawn to the flame.

1021
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:29,517
There's something I find

1022
00:40:29,551 --> 00:40:31,965
utterly terrifying
about air travel.

1023
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,241
And equally fascinating.

1024
00:40:35,586 --> 00:40:38,068
I think I'm finally starting
to figure out who you are.

1025
00:40:38,103 --> 00:40:39,103
Is that so?

1026
00:40:39,137 --> 00:40:40,103
Mm-hmm.

1027
00:40:40,137 --> 00:40:42,206
Care to share your observations?

1028
00:40:43,551 --> 00:40:45,448
Well...

1029
00:40:45,482 --> 00:40:48,448
okay, if you don't mind
my saying,

1030
00:40:48,482 --> 00:40:50,002
you're a little bit
of a control freak.

1031
00:40:51,137 --> 00:40:52,448
Well...

1032
00:40:53,448 --> 00:40:54,448
True.

1033
00:40:55,586 --> 00:40:56,758
You get on a plane,

1034
00:40:56,793 --> 00:40:59,137
and you can't look over
anyone's shoulder.

1035
00:40:59,172 --> 00:41:00,724
And you have to put your trust

1036
00:41:00,758 --> 00:41:02,620
in someone else
to have the control.

1037
00:41:02,655 --> 00:41:03,975
That's where
your fear comes from.

1038
00:41:06,103 --> 00:41:08,034
I never really
thought of it that way, but...

1039
00:41:08,068 --> 00:41:09,137
maybe you have a point.

1040
00:41:10,896 --> 00:41:13,413
Okay, my only final question is,

1041
00:41:13,448 --> 00:41:16,206
who is responsible
for these trust issues?

1042
00:41:16,241 --> 00:41:17,172
Your ex-wife?

1043
00:41:17,206 --> 00:41:18,724
Or a best friend, maybe?

1044
00:41:21,241 --> 00:41:23,034
Wow.

1045
00:41:23,068 --> 00:41:24,586
Um...

1046
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:29,724
Both, actually.

1047
00:41:29,758 --> 00:41:32,310
My wife didn't leave me
because I'm a workaholic.

1048
00:41:32,344 --> 00:41:34,241
My wife left me
for my best friend.

1049
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,068
Wow.

1050
00:41:40,103 --> 00:41:42,379
Matt, that's, um...

1051
00:41:42,413 --> 00:41:43,896
I'm so sorry.

1052
00:41:47,206 --> 00:41:49,724
So to take the sting off
all the hurt and betrayal,

1053
00:41:49,758 --> 00:41:51,965
I poured myself into
the one thing I was good at.

1054
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,137
Business.

1055
00:41:56,896 --> 00:41:58,448
Yeah, when things ended
with my ex,

1056
00:41:58,482 --> 00:42:01,482
I felt the weight of the world
on my shoulders,

1057
00:42:01,517 --> 00:42:02,527
and I was trying to take care

1058
00:42:02,551 --> 00:42:05,724
of Chloe
and the rest of my family.

1059
00:42:08,068 --> 00:42:10,148
Well, from what I can tell,
you're doing a great job.

1060
00:42:12,758 --> 00:42:13,862
Thanks.

1061
00:42:13,896 --> 00:42:14,931
I like to think so.

1062
00:42:19,137 --> 00:42:20,586
So...

1063
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:23,034
working for your family
your whole career,

1064
00:42:23,068 --> 00:42:25,482
you ever felt the need
to leave the nest?

1065
00:42:25,517 --> 00:42:26,931
Fly out on your own?

1066
00:42:26,965 --> 00:42:28,241
I did.

1067
00:42:28,275 --> 00:42:30,206
Actually, I got offered
a big job in New York

1068
00:42:30,241 --> 00:42:32,103
to fly internationally,

1069
00:42:32,137 --> 00:42:34,206
which has always been
my dream to travel.

1070
00:42:34,241 --> 00:42:35,793
And?

1071
00:42:35,827 --> 00:42:37,068
You know, Chloe.

1072
00:42:37,103 --> 00:42:38,689
She wasn't even five yet,

1073
00:42:38,724 --> 00:42:43,206
and my marriage was building up
ice on the wings.

1074
00:42:46,517 --> 00:42:48,277
Do you ever think about
what might have been?

1075
00:42:49,793 --> 00:42:51,241
Well, life comes
with sacrifices.

1076
00:42:51,275 --> 00:42:53,724
And...

1077
00:42:53,758 --> 00:42:55,482
I don't believe
in living life with regrets.

1078
00:42:59,241 --> 00:43:01,862
That may be true, but...

1079
00:43:01,896 --> 00:43:03,275
you never answered my question.

1080
00:43:29,379 --> 00:43:31,827
Snowflake's very own
handbell choir.

1081
00:43:34,931 --> 00:43:37,896
It's memories I have
with Chloe like this

1082
00:43:37,931 --> 00:43:39,793
while she was growing up.

1083
00:43:39,827 --> 00:43:41,793
I wouldn't trade them
for one week in Paris.

1084
00:43:43,034 --> 00:43:44,724
You have a lot
of family traditions.

1085
00:43:44,758 --> 00:43:46,620
Mm-hmm.

1086
00:43:48,551 --> 00:43:49,517
And what about you?

1087
00:43:49,551 --> 00:43:51,965
I assume you spent holidays
with your dad

1088
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,137
away from boarding school?

1089
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:54,907
Yeah, he always used
to fly me out to Manhattan

1090
00:43:54,931 --> 00:43:57,931
for the firm's office party.

1091
00:43:57,965 --> 00:44:00,137
Did you have Christmas
traditions together?

1092
00:44:00,172 --> 00:44:03,206
Only one, really.

1093
00:44:03,241 --> 00:44:04,310
I remember

1094
00:44:04,344 --> 00:44:05,941
he always used to take me
to Rockefeller Center

1095
00:44:05,965 --> 00:44:07,655
on Christmas Eve.

1096
00:44:07,689 --> 00:44:09,275
He said if I wished hard enough,

1097
00:44:09,310 --> 00:44:12,206
at midnight, my Christmas wish
might come true.

1098
00:44:12,241 --> 00:44:13,206
That's sweet.

1099
00:44:13,241 --> 00:44:14,379
And did they?

1100
00:44:14,413 --> 00:44:15,379
Most of the time, he was right.

1101
00:44:15,413 --> 00:44:16,724
Other times, I figured

1102
00:44:16,758 --> 00:44:18,586
I just wasn't
wishing hard enough.

1103
00:44:20,827 --> 00:44:22,724
Oh.

1104
00:44:24,275 --> 00:44:25,862
Hansen here.

1105
00:44:25,896 --> 00:44:27,758
Oh, hi, Mr. Connor.

1106
00:44:27,793 --> 00:44:29,424
Yes, I took a look
at the office space in Helena

1107
00:44:29,448 --> 00:44:30,793
earlier today,

1108
00:44:30,827 --> 00:44:32,286
and I think it will work well
as our new base.

1109
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:34,206
Mm-hmm.

1110
00:44:34,241 --> 00:44:35,275
Understood.

1111
00:44:35,310 --> 00:44:36,586
Give my respects to the board.

1112
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,034
New base?

1113
00:44:41,068 --> 00:44:41,931
I thought you went to Helena

1114
00:44:41,965 --> 00:44:43,551
just to check out
the operations.

1115
00:44:43,586 --> 00:44:45,517
Yes, I've been evaluating
various options.

1116
00:44:45,551 --> 00:44:46,700
It's more sensible
to be centralized

1117
00:44:46,724 --> 00:44:48,241
and to move
the company headquarters

1118
00:44:48,275 --> 00:44:49,907
where the company
has most of its activity.

1119
00:44:49,931 --> 00:44:52,344
I told you Sundancer
has to stay in Snowflake.

1120
00:44:52,379 --> 00:44:55,758
I can't ask the staff
to uproot their lives.

1121
00:44:55,793 --> 00:44:58,379
I understand
the decision has consequences,

1122
00:44:58,413 --> 00:44:59,931
but it's the right thing to do.

1123
00:44:59,965 --> 00:45:02,068
Yeah, for you, of course.

1124
00:45:02,103 --> 00:45:03,700
When were you going
to tell me about this plan?

1125
00:45:03,724 --> 00:45:05,320
You're not my VP of operations
at this point.

1126
00:45:05,344 --> 00:45:06,620
I realize that,

1127
00:45:06,655 --> 00:45:07,793
but, apparently,

1128
00:45:07,827 --> 00:45:10,655
what, there's no "I" in team
or "we" either?

1129
00:45:10,689 --> 00:45:13,034
Don't I get an opportunity
to at least weigh in

1130
00:45:13,068 --> 00:45:14,793
instead of just being
left out in the cold?

1131
00:45:17,068 --> 00:45:19,034
You know what?
Thank you for dinner.

1132
00:45:19,068 --> 00:45:20,068
It was a real treat.

1133
00:45:32,068 --> 00:45:34,896
This house smells like
a Christmas cookie explosion.

1134
00:45:34,931 --> 00:45:37,655
You know how baking relaxes me
whenever I'm upset.

1135
00:45:38,758 --> 00:45:40,724
Who's responsible
for pushing you to level orange?

1136
00:45:40,758 --> 00:45:43,241
Matt Hansen.

1137
00:45:43,275 --> 00:45:44,931
We met
down at the tavern earlier

1138
00:45:44,965 --> 00:45:46,206
to watch your uncle play.

1139
00:45:46,241 --> 00:45:47,448
It began nice enough,

1140
00:45:47,482 --> 00:45:49,182
but, of course, he had to pull
the rug out from under me

1141
00:45:49,206 --> 00:45:50,413
before the night was over.

1142
00:45:50,448 --> 00:45:54,034
You know, for someone
who can't seem to stand the guy,

1143
00:45:54,068 --> 00:45:55,931
you sure are spending
a lot of time together.

1144
00:45:55,965 --> 00:45:57,275
It's not that I can't stand him.

1145
00:45:57,310 --> 00:45:58,344
It's that I resent

1146
00:45:58,379 --> 00:45:59,551
not being included

1147
00:45:59,586 --> 00:46:01,182
in major decisions
regarding the airline.

1148
00:46:01,206 --> 00:46:02,517
You mean, like,

1149
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:03,793
how you're not telling him

1150
00:46:03,827 --> 00:46:06,068
about how you're trying
to save Santa's Flight?

1151
00:46:06,103 --> 00:46:07,241
That's different.

1152
00:46:07,275 --> 00:46:08,551
We're simply exploring options

1153
00:46:08,586 --> 00:46:09,976
on how to keep it afloat
through donations.

1154
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,413
Have you told him about it?

1155
00:46:13,206 --> 00:46:15,206
Then you are
keeping it a secret.

1156
00:46:15,241 --> 00:46:16,458
Secrets mean
you're up to something bad.

1157
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:17,482
But I'm not.

1158
00:46:23,310 --> 00:46:24,931
Thank you. Happy holidays.

1159
00:46:28,517 --> 00:46:29,517
Frank.

1160
00:46:29,551 --> 00:46:30,551
What a lovely surprise.

1161
00:46:30,586 --> 00:46:31,586
How are you?

1162
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:34,310
Uh, pretty great, actually.

1163
00:46:34,344 --> 00:46:36,206
Just been out canvassing
a few businesses

1164
00:46:36,241 --> 00:46:39,137
about sponsoring some more kids
on Santa's Flight.

1165
00:46:39,172 --> 00:46:40,896
Oh, by that chipper demeanor,

1166
00:46:40,931 --> 00:46:42,241
I'd say the day went well.

1167
00:46:42,275 --> 00:46:47,275
Well, I got Aunt Trudy's Diner
to sponsor two more kids.

1168
00:46:47,310 --> 00:46:48,758
So we've got four days to go.

1169
00:46:48,793 --> 00:46:50,034
We're cutting it a little close.

1170
00:46:52,793 --> 00:46:56,068
You wouldn't want to join me
at the theater, would you?

1171
00:46:56,103 --> 00:46:58,310
They're playing
It's a Wonderful Life.

1172
00:46:58,344 --> 00:46:59,758
I haven't seen that in ages.

1173
00:47:00,827 --> 00:47:02,965
It still holds up,
if you care to come with.

1174
00:47:06,448 --> 00:47:07,931
You know what? It's okay.

1175
00:47:07,965 --> 00:47:09,827
I'm sure you've got
lots of other things to do.

1176
00:47:09,862 --> 00:47:11,413
Happy holidays, Frank.

1177
00:47:18,206 --> 00:47:19,206
This is Matt.

1178
00:47:19,241 --> 00:47:21,586
Hi, it's Jenny.

1179
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:24,620
I realize I may have come off
a little prickly earlier.

1180
00:47:24,655 --> 00:47:26,034
I want to apologize.

1181
00:47:26,068 --> 00:47:27,241
No need.

1182
00:47:27,275 --> 00:47:28,862
You like to speak your mind.

1183
00:47:28,896 --> 00:47:31,000
That's an important trait
for any VP position.

1184
00:47:31,034 --> 00:47:32,517
Really?

1185
00:47:32,551 --> 00:47:34,137
Then why have I wasted
all this time

1186
00:47:34,172 --> 00:47:36,241
holding back in telling you
how I really feel?

1187
00:47:36,275 --> 00:47:39,068
If it wasn't for
that tiny filter of yours,

1188
00:47:39,103 --> 00:47:40,562
I doubt we would have
ever gotten this far.

1189
00:47:40,586 --> 00:47:41,724
On that note,

1190
00:47:41,758 --> 00:47:43,517
I wanted to see
if you were free tomorrow.

1191
00:47:43,551 --> 00:47:44,896
Say, later afternoon?

1192
00:47:44,931 --> 00:47:46,827
What do you have in mind?

1193
00:47:46,862 --> 00:47:50,068
You let me in to one
of your Christmas traditions

1194
00:47:50,103 --> 00:47:51,241
growing up.

1195
00:47:51,275 --> 00:47:52,896
I thought I'd share
with you one of mine.

1196
00:47:53,931 --> 00:47:55,517
Sure, why not. It's a date.

1197
00:47:57,275 --> 00:48:01,137
I mean, not a date-date,
obviously.

1198
00:48:03,724 --> 00:48:05,103
I will see you then.

1199
00:48:16,344 --> 00:48:18,379
All I'm asking you to consider

1200
00:48:18,413 --> 00:48:20,206
is how moving to Helena

1201
00:48:20,241 --> 00:48:21,655
will risk losing

1202
00:48:21,689 --> 00:48:24,793
the strong relationships we have
with vendors here in Snowflake.

1203
00:48:26,068 --> 00:48:27,034
Why do I get the feeling

1204
00:48:27,068 --> 00:48:28,424
I was brought here
under false pretenses?

1205
00:48:28,448 --> 00:48:30,517
I just wish
I had said it to you last night.

1206
00:48:30,551 --> 00:48:31,724
Before you stormed off.

1207
00:48:33,275 --> 00:48:34,724
About that...

1208
00:48:34,758 --> 00:48:36,172
Could we really
consider it a storm?

1209
00:48:37,586 --> 00:48:38,482
What's going on here?

1210
00:48:38,517 --> 00:48:40,482
Tree-trimming time.

1211
00:48:40,517 --> 00:48:43,000
We got a late start this year
on account of...

1212
00:48:44,448 --> 00:48:45,551
Dad and Charlie are coming,

1213
00:48:45,586 --> 00:48:48,586
and I thought you could join us
for some eggnog

1214
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:50,689
and learn a little more
about Snowflake.

1215
00:48:50,724 --> 00:48:53,862
Trust me, I already got
an earful from Sue.

1216
00:48:53,896 --> 00:48:55,689
She certainly loves
to small-talk.

1217
00:49:03,793 --> 00:49:04,965
What is this?

1218
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:10,241
Mom's 25-year service pin.

1219
00:49:10,275 --> 00:49:11,275
The design is an homage

1220
00:49:11,310 --> 00:49:13,517
to an ace World War I
fighter pilot

1221
00:49:13,551 --> 00:49:15,034
who started
his own private airline

1222
00:49:15,068 --> 00:49:16,000
after the war.

1223
00:49:16,034 --> 00:49:17,689
Incredible.

1224
00:49:17,724 --> 00:49:19,724
It is to aviation junkies
like me.

1225
00:49:19,758 --> 00:49:21,172
Is it real gold?

1226
00:49:21,206 --> 00:49:23,965
24-karat gold,
with a rare amber diamond.

1227
00:49:27,241 --> 00:49:29,896
Mom and Grandma collected
all of this memorabilia.

1228
00:49:30,896 --> 00:49:33,379
Passed it down to me.

1229
00:49:33,413 --> 00:49:34,758
It must be valuable.

1230
00:49:35,793 --> 00:49:38,034
A local collector
offered a fortune,

1231
00:49:38,068 --> 00:49:39,631
but the sentimental value
is way more important to me.

1232
00:49:39,655 --> 00:49:41,586
Of course.

1233
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:44,241
♪ O Christmas tree
O Christmas tree ♪

1234
00:49:44,275 --> 00:49:47,000
♪ The time has come to decorate
the Christmas tree ♪

1235
00:49:47,034 --> 00:49:49,310
Oh, no.

1236
00:49:49,344 --> 00:49:50,413
I'm sorry.

1237
00:49:50,448 --> 00:49:51,769
Is there a work emergency
we don't know about?

1238
00:49:51,793 --> 00:49:52,803
Are we all getting pink-slipped?

1239
00:49:52,827 --> 00:49:55,000
Not funny, Charlie.

1240
00:49:55,034 --> 00:49:56,034
Matt is my guest.

1241
00:49:56,068 --> 00:49:57,206
So who's ready

1242
00:49:57,241 --> 00:49:59,896
to get this Christmas tree
decorating party started?

1243
00:49:59,931 --> 00:50:01,379
Okay.

1244
00:50:01,413 --> 00:50:03,517
Team, everybody,
get to your stations.

1245
00:50:03,551 --> 00:50:05,758
Chloe, Megan,
you are on ornaments.

1246
00:50:05,793 --> 00:50:07,482
Charlie, you are
on tinsel and tunes.

1247
00:50:07,517 --> 00:50:09,586
Dad, you have to untangle
the twinkle lights.

1248
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:10,689
Anybody want to trade?

1249
00:50:10,724 --> 00:50:14,068
And Matt, you can sit back
and enjoy the action

1250
00:50:14,103 --> 00:50:15,620
while I get the eggnog.

1251
00:50:16,517 --> 00:50:17,551
Nice delegating.

1252
00:50:19,448 --> 00:50:22,482
"And I heard him exclaim
as he drove out of sight,

1253
00:50:22,517 --> 00:50:26,068
'Merry Christmas to all,
and to all a good night.'"

1254
00:50:28,241 --> 00:50:30,034
Yay!

1255
00:50:30,068 --> 00:50:31,310
Thanks, Dad.

1256
00:50:31,344 --> 00:50:33,379
Now it's beginning
to look a lot like Christmas.

1257
00:50:34,586 --> 00:50:35,655
Thanks for inviting me.

1258
00:50:35,689 --> 00:50:36,758
And thank you all

1259
00:50:36,793 --> 00:50:38,896
for the many enlightening facts
about town.

1260
00:50:38,931 --> 00:50:39,941
Oh, I hope you took notes.

1261
00:50:39,965 --> 00:50:41,000
There will be a quiz.

1262
00:50:43,758 --> 00:50:44,758
Dinner is served.

1263
00:50:44,793 --> 00:50:45,793
Oh, good.

1264
00:50:47,241 --> 00:50:49,620
So has anyone
started thinking about

1265
00:50:49,655 --> 00:50:50,586
making New Year's resolutions?

1266
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:51,620
Dad?

1267
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:54,034
I don't believe
in that nonsense.

1268
00:50:54,068 --> 00:50:55,413
Ah.

1269
00:50:55,448 --> 00:50:57,000
Short and pithy,
I'll give him that.

1270
00:50:58,103 --> 00:50:59,517
What about you, Charlie?

1271
00:50:59,551 --> 00:51:02,137
Uh, well, New Year's
is about making a fresh start,

1272
00:51:02,172 --> 00:51:03,586
so I am looking forward

1273
00:51:03,620 --> 00:51:07,655
to seeing the exciting
new prospects in my future.

1274
00:51:07,689 --> 00:51:09,689
My plan is to write down
a list of personal goals.

1275
00:51:09,724 --> 00:51:11,034
Studies show

1276
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:13,113
you are more likely to achieve
the things you want in life

1277
00:51:13,137 --> 00:51:14,448
if you write them down on paper.

1278
00:51:15,758 --> 00:51:17,034
In that case,

1279
00:51:17,068 --> 00:51:18,172
maybe I should write down

1280
00:51:18,206 --> 00:51:21,448
the top three universities
I hope to get accepted to

1281
00:51:21,482 --> 00:51:23,551
now that I've decided
to get into web design.

1282
00:51:23,586 --> 00:51:24,689
I was telling Chloe

1283
00:51:24,724 --> 00:51:26,068
if she had any interest

1284
00:51:26,103 --> 00:51:27,689
in applying
to some tech colleges,

1285
00:51:27,724 --> 00:51:30,044
I would be willing to write her
a letter of recommendation.

1286
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:33,000
That is so generous, Matt.

1287
00:51:34,413 --> 00:51:36,862
And Chloe, I'm so proud
that this is your decision.

1288
00:51:39,517 --> 00:51:40,517
What about you?

1289
00:51:40,551 --> 00:51:43,103
Any earth-shattering
personal goals

1290
00:51:43,137 --> 00:51:44,586
you'd like to share
with the group?

1291
00:51:45,965 --> 00:51:47,103
Yeah.

1292
00:51:50,103 --> 00:51:51,182
I've always dreaded
the month of December

1293
00:51:51,206 --> 00:51:52,413
because it reminded me

1294
00:51:52,448 --> 00:51:54,034
it was the profit/loss
time of the year.

1295
00:51:56,068 --> 00:51:57,689
And how do you plan
on changing that?

1296
00:51:59,068 --> 00:52:00,137
I'm not sure.

1297
00:52:00,172 --> 00:52:02,103
But tonight has been
a welcome respite.

1298
00:52:03,586 --> 00:52:06,758
Maybe I'll start a special
tradition of my own.

1299
00:52:08,965 --> 00:52:10,206
I like the sound of that.

1300
00:52:10,241 --> 00:52:11,448
What about you, Mom?

1301
00:52:13,413 --> 00:52:15,862
Well, with all the shakeups
going on at the airline,

1302
00:52:15,896 --> 00:52:17,586
Dad retiring,

1303
00:52:17,620 --> 00:52:20,689
and you almost finished
with high school,

1304
00:52:20,724 --> 00:52:22,827
I finally think it's time

1305
00:52:22,862 --> 00:52:24,931
I start mapping out
the next chapter in my life.

1306
00:52:27,689 --> 00:52:30,655
Well, my guess is
it'll be a real page-turner.

1307
00:52:31,896 --> 00:52:32,896
I hope so.

1308
00:52:32,931 --> 00:52:34,448
To the new year.

1309
00:52:40,034 --> 00:52:42,896
It's hard when the child
becomes the parent,

1310
00:52:42,931 --> 00:52:45,034
but I sat my dad down,

1311
00:52:45,068 --> 00:52:47,482
and I told him he's retired,

1312
00:52:47,517 --> 00:52:51,344
he needs to open himself up more
to new challenges.

1313
00:52:51,379 --> 00:52:53,206
Hmm. How did he respond?

1314
00:52:53,241 --> 00:52:54,758
Well, he's a little bit
hard to read,

1315
00:52:54,793 --> 00:52:58,068
but I imagine
he got the message.

1316
00:52:58,103 --> 00:52:59,482
Well, I have hope.

1317
00:52:59,517 --> 00:53:01,068
Me too.

1318
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:04,413
Oh, I totally
forgot to tell you.

1319
00:53:04,448 --> 00:53:06,689
The principal
from Snowflake Elementary?

1320
00:53:06,724 --> 00:53:07,941
He was in the audience
the other night,

1321
00:53:07,965 --> 00:53:09,034
and he called and said

1322
00:53:09,068 --> 00:53:09,931
that they're looking
for a new music teacher.

1323
00:53:09,965 --> 00:53:11,241
Really?

1324
00:53:11,275 --> 00:53:12,517
Charlie, music is your passion.

1325
00:53:12,551 --> 00:53:13,551
What are you waiting for?

1326
00:53:15,103 --> 00:53:16,793
Well, I can't just
leave the airline

1327
00:53:16,827 --> 00:53:18,000
and let Jenny down.

1328
00:53:19,413 --> 00:53:21,517
Charlie, how many times
have we been through this?

1329
00:53:21,551 --> 00:53:22,751
You hate working in marketing.

1330
00:53:24,275 --> 00:53:25,286
Once again,
this is fate calling,

1331
00:53:25,310 --> 00:53:26,241
and what do you do?

1332
00:53:26,275 --> 00:53:28,034
You stand frozen
in the headlights,

1333
00:53:28,068 --> 00:53:29,596
ready to let
the best thing in your life

1334
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:30,586
slip through your fingers.

1335
00:53:30,620 --> 00:53:32,379
Wait.

1336
00:53:32,413 --> 00:53:34,551
Are we talking about
the job prospect?

1337
00:53:34,586 --> 00:53:36,172
Or are we talking
about you and me?

1338
00:53:37,068 --> 00:53:39,206
What difference
does it make, Charlie?

1339
00:53:39,241 --> 00:53:40,841
You're incapable
of changing who you are.

1340
00:53:50,275 --> 00:53:51,896
I'll clean up in a bit.

1341
00:53:53,620 --> 00:53:56,413
I was hoping
you'd be up for a stroll

1342
00:53:56,448 --> 00:53:58,862
after that heavy meal?

1343
00:53:58,896 --> 00:54:01,310
Sure. Sounds nice.

1344
00:54:06,103 --> 00:54:08,896
So when are you
flying back to Portland?

1345
00:54:08,931 --> 00:54:11,034
I'm supposed
to fly out tomorrow.

1346
00:54:11,068 --> 00:54:13,862
And are you feeling
a little less anxious?

1347
00:54:13,896 --> 00:54:14,862
About flying,

1348
00:54:14,896 --> 00:54:17,241
or about the future
of Connor Airlines?

1349
00:54:17,275 --> 00:54:18,758
I don't know. Pick one.

1350
00:54:20,068 --> 00:54:21,700
Well, it might be because of
your little push today,

1351
00:54:21,724 --> 00:54:24,172
but I think I'm finally
starting to realize

1352
00:54:24,206 --> 00:54:27,965
how to deal with my anxiety
in a more healthy way.

1353
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,379
I'm glad to hear it.

1354
00:54:29,413 --> 00:54:31,034
Before you go back,

1355
00:54:31,068 --> 00:54:33,724
I do have to get something
off my chest.

1356
00:54:35,206 --> 00:54:37,379
Hank. Hi.

1357
00:54:37,413 --> 00:54:39,689
I will take one of
your finest hot cocoas

1358
00:54:39,724 --> 00:54:41,344
and a black coffee
for the gentleman.

1359
00:54:41,379 --> 00:54:43,551
Actually, cocoa sounds good.

1360
00:54:45,758 --> 00:54:46,724
Thank you.

1361
00:54:46,758 --> 00:54:48,344
Thanks, Hank.

1362
00:54:48,379 --> 00:54:49,517
Here you go.

1363
00:54:49,551 --> 00:54:51,310
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1364
00:54:51,344 --> 00:54:52,586
And we're all ready

1365
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:54,700
to bring enough cocoa
for Santa's Flight on Thursday.

1366
00:54:55,689 --> 00:54:57,344
Great.

1367
00:54:57,379 --> 00:54:58,379
Thanks, Hank.

1368
00:55:00,724 --> 00:55:01,655
Am I hearing things,

1369
00:55:01,689 --> 00:55:03,079
or did he just say
"Santa's Flight"?

1370
00:55:03,103 --> 00:55:05,000
Because I specifically recall
canceling that.

1371
00:55:05,034 --> 00:55:07,034
Yes, and that's what
I wanted to talk to you about.

1372
00:55:07,068 --> 00:55:09,413
I agreed
to cancel Santa's Flight.

1373
00:55:09,448 --> 00:55:11,551
But then Charlie and I
canvassed the community.

1374
00:55:11,586 --> 00:55:14,379
We found businesses
to sponsor the event.

1375
00:55:14,413 --> 00:55:15,689
It is a win-win for everyone.

1376
00:55:15,724 --> 00:55:16,872
Then why didn't you tell me
about it

1377
00:55:16,896 --> 00:55:18,176
instead of going behind my back?

1378
00:55:19,206 --> 00:55:22,344
Because you shut me down
at the mere mention of it,

1379
00:55:22,379 --> 00:55:23,596
so I figured it wouldn't
make a difference.

1380
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:25,379
I have a responsibility
to Connor Airlines.

1381
00:55:26,931 --> 00:55:28,413
How do you expect me
to make you my VP

1382
00:55:28,448 --> 00:55:29,488
if I can't even trust you?

1383
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:33,620
Good night, Jenny.

1384
00:55:44,862 --> 00:55:46,896
There's a face
that sank a thousand ships.

1385
00:55:48,758 --> 00:55:49,862
Did Matt find out about us

1386
00:55:49,896 --> 00:55:51,517
trying to, you know,
save Santa's Flight?

1387
00:55:53,965 --> 00:55:55,000
How'd it go?

1388
00:55:56,068 --> 00:55:57,206
Let's just say

1389
00:55:57,241 --> 00:55:59,401
I will not be winning December's
employee of the month.

1390
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:01,448
Well, now what do we do?

1391
00:56:01,482 --> 00:56:03,689
I'm open to any ideas.

1392
00:56:03,724 --> 00:56:04,907
I'm probably going to get fired,

1393
00:56:04,931 --> 00:56:07,206
and Santa's Flight
seems to be on life support.

1394
00:56:07,241 --> 00:56:09,137
That's a bit
of a negative perspective.

1395
00:56:09,172 --> 00:56:10,517
Right now is exactly the time

1396
00:56:10,551 --> 00:56:11,734
we should be stepping up
to the plate.

1397
00:56:11,758 --> 00:56:13,068
Yeah, Charlie's right, Jenny.

1398
00:56:13,103 --> 00:56:14,389
At this point,
we've got nothing to lose.

1399
00:56:14,413 --> 00:56:15,310
A Channel 8 news van

1400
00:56:15,344 --> 00:56:16,562
is waiting outside
to interview you

1401
00:56:16,586 --> 00:56:17,724
for the morning broadcast.

1402
00:56:17,758 --> 00:56:20,517
So you can either
sit here and mope

1403
00:56:20,551 --> 00:56:22,931
or show 'em what you do best.

1404
00:56:29,206 --> 00:56:31,551
This is such a passion project
for you, Jenny.

1405
00:56:31,586 --> 00:56:33,344
What makes Santa's Flight
so special?

1406
00:56:33,379 --> 00:56:35,689
It's a way of giving back
to those in need

1407
00:56:35,724 --> 00:56:38,551
at a time when the world
really needs human kindness

1408
00:56:38,586 --> 00:56:39,551
now more than ever.

1409
00:56:39,586 --> 00:56:41,827
But this is personal
to you, isn't it?

1410
00:56:41,862 --> 00:56:44,517
Yes, very much so.

1411
00:56:44,551 --> 00:56:45,896
My mother started the tradition

1412
00:56:45,931 --> 00:56:47,551
back when she was
the guiding force

1413
00:56:47,586 --> 00:56:48,586
at Sundancer Airlines.

1414
00:56:48,620 --> 00:56:51,344
And my mom taught
my whole family

1415
00:56:51,379 --> 00:56:52,517
an important lesson

1416
00:56:52,551 --> 00:56:54,517
about the true meaning
of Christmas.

1417
00:56:54,551 --> 00:56:55,862
Until now,

1418
00:56:55,896 --> 00:56:58,896
this event was sponsored
entirely by Sundancer Airlines.

1419
00:56:58,931 --> 00:57:01,068
But I'm hearing rumors
you're planning a charity night

1420
00:57:01,103 --> 00:57:03,068
to fund Santa's Flight.

1421
00:57:03,103 --> 00:57:04,965
Why now are you seeking
private donations

1422
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,000
to keep this going?

1423
00:57:07,344 --> 00:57:08,344
Because...

1424
00:57:11,689 --> 00:57:13,129
because we can no longer
do it alone.

1425
00:57:14,068 --> 00:57:15,862
I don't like
having to ask people for help.

1426
00:57:15,896 --> 00:57:17,275
Nobody does.

1427
00:57:18,862 --> 00:57:20,241
But we don't have a choice.

1428
00:57:21,827 --> 00:57:23,931
And it's all
for the kids, right?

1429
00:57:25,068 --> 00:57:27,034
And just like the good folks
in Bedford Falls

1430
00:57:27,068 --> 00:57:28,551
rallied around George Bailey

1431
00:57:28,586 --> 00:57:30,448
in "It's a Wonderful Life",

1432
00:57:30,482 --> 00:57:32,724
we are turning to the good folks
in Snowflake

1433
00:57:32,758 --> 00:57:35,103
to help keep Santa's Flight
on course.

1434
00:57:35,137 --> 00:57:36,344
"No man is a failure

1435
00:57:36,379 --> 00:57:37,344
if he's got friends."

1436
00:57:37,379 --> 00:57:39,689
Exactly.

1437
00:57:39,724 --> 00:57:41,124
Santa's Flight
could use a few more.

1438
00:57:48,068 --> 00:57:49,137
Mr. Connor?

1439
00:57:49,172 --> 00:57:50,241
It's Matt.

1440
00:57:54,655 --> 00:57:56,931
Nice speech out there, kiddo.

1441
00:57:56,965 --> 00:57:58,137
Your mom would be so proud.

1442
00:57:58,172 --> 00:58:00,724
Thanks, Dad.

1443
00:58:00,758 --> 00:58:02,137
Now the only thing
on my to-do list

1444
00:58:02,172 --> 00:58:04,034
is to write
my resignation letter.

1445
00:58:04,068 --> 00:58:05,068
That won't be necessary.

1446
00:58:07,482 --> 00:58:10,034
To echo your dad,

1447
00:58:10,068 --> 00:58:11,217
Jenny, that was
an incredible speech

1448
00:58:11,241 --> 00:58:13,000
you just gave out there.

1449
00:58:13,034 --> 00:58:14,344
I spoke the truth.

1450
00:58:15,931 --> 00:58:16,931
Frankly, I'm surprised

1451
00:58:16,965 --> 00:58:17,896
you didn't leap
at the opportunity

1452
00:58:17,931 --> 00:58:19,724
to throw a certain
hopeless pragmatic

1453
00:58:19,758 --> 00:58:20,862
under the bus.

1454
00:58:21,862 --> 00:58:22,965
For what it's worth, Matt,

1455
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,217
I should've been honest
with you from the start.

1456
00:58:24,241 --> 00:58:25,448
No. You were right.

1457
00:58:25,482 --> 00:58:27,275
In the mindset
I was in from the start,

1458
00:58:27,310 --> 00:58:28,510
I would've just shut you down.

1459
00:58:29,275 --> 00:58:32,034
But luckily for me, and for you,

1460
00:58:32,068 --> 00:58:34,448
I just got off the phone
with Mr. Connor,

1461
00:58:34,482 --> 00:58:35,689
and I managed to convince him

1462
00:58:35,724 --> 00:58:36,689
that this charity effort

1463
00:58:36,724 --> 00:58:38,206
could generate
a lot of free press.

1464
00:58:38,241 --> 00:58:39,827
Not to mention some goodwill.

1465
00:58:39,862 --> 00:58:42,448
So Santa's Flight
isn't canceled?

1466
00:58:43,448 --> 00:58:44,931
Not if we can find
a way to save it.

1467
00:58:45,758 --> 00:58:47,275
That's great.

1468
00:58:48,517 --> 00:58:50,379
"We"?

1469
00:58:50,413 --> 00:58:51,344
Wow, that is...

1470
00:58:51,379 --> 00:58:52,665
It's strange
to hear you say that.

1471
00:58:52,689 --> 00:58:54,379
Well, don't you think it's time

1472
00:58:54,413 --> 00:58:55,379
to find out
what we're all capable of

1473
00:58:55,413 --> 00:58:56,413
working together?

1474
00:58:58,206 --> 00:58:59,551
You're on.

1475
00:59:02,482 --> 00:59:04,448
Okay, guys, let's do it!

1476
00:59:04,482 --> 00:59:06,551
Whoo!

1477
00:59:06,586 --> 00:59:07,931
Santa's Flight is back on!

1478
00:59:11,931 --> 00:59:13,448
Whoo!

1479
00:59:13,965 --> 00:59:15,310
Hi, Ann.

1480
00:59:15,344 --> 00:59:16,896
Perfect timing, Jenny.

1481
00:59:16,931 --> 00:59:19,034
I was just putting
some of the toy donations aside.

1482
00:59:19,068 --> 00:59:20,344
This is a decent start.

1483
00:59:20,379 --> 00:59:21,896
Well, with hopefully
much more to come

1484
00:59:21,931 --> 00:59:23,689
after the benefit concert.

1485
00:59:23,724 --> 00:59:24,655
I'll get the rest of the stuff.

1486
00:59:24,689 --> 00:59:25,689
Thanks, Ann.

1487
00:59:27,206 --> 00:59:29,551
Okay, are you ready
for some serious business?

1488
00:59:29,586 --> 00:59:31,000
So very serious.

1489
00:59:34,931 --> 00:59:36,172
Looks just like you.

1490
00:59:36,206 --> 00:59:39,896
Oh, I wonder if Ann carries
businessman action figures.

1491
00:59:39,931 --> 00:59:41,793
We could call them
"the Bottom Liners".

1492
00:59:43,379 --> 00:59:44,596
What was your favorite game
growing up?

1493
00:59:44,620 --> 00:59:46,206
Monopoly.

1494
00:59:47,620 --> 00:59:48,896
What about you?

1495
00:59:48,931 --> 00:59:49,896
Um...

1496
00:59:49,931 --> 00:59:51,724
Game of Life.

1497
00:59:51,758 --> 00:59:53,068
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

1498
00:59:53,103 --> 00:59:54,034
I seem to remember

1499
00:59:54,068 --> 00:59:55,517
a financial element
to that strategy.

1500
00:59:55,551 --> 00:59:56,827
Yes.

1501
00:59:56,862 --> 00:59:58,424
Whoever ended up
with the most money won,

1502
00:59:58,448 --> 00:59:59,413
but I always imagined

1503
00:59:59,448 --> 01:00:01,310
I'd grow up to be
a rich philanthropist.

1504
01:00:01,344 --> 01:00:03,310
- Is that so?
- Mm-hmm.

1505
01:00:03,344 --> 01:00:04,551
The Beckett Foundation

1506
01:00:04,586 --> 01:00:06,931
for Girls Who Dreamed
They Could Fly.

1507
01:00:06,965 --> 01:00:09,379
Well, you certainly
realized your dream.

1508
01:00:09,413 --> 01:00:11,379
And what did you
first dream about being

1509
01:00:11,413 --> 01:00:12,413
when you were little?

1510
01:00:13,827 --> 01:00:16,137
Believe it or not, a teacher.

1511
01:00:16,172 --> 01:00:17,896
A teacher? Really?

1512
01:00:17,931 --> 01:00:19,413
- Yes.
- Oh.

1513
01:00:19,448 --> 01:00:20,931
I always sort of envied

1514
01:00:20,965 --> 01:00:24,241
their ability to inspire
and mold young minds.

1515
01:00:24,275 --> 01:00:26,137
One part of business
I actually really enjoy

1516
01:00:26,172 --> 01:00:27,931
is mentoring some of
the younger employees.

1517
01:00:29,379 --> 01:00:30,931
Just out of curiosity,

1518
01:00:30,965 --> 01:00:32,758
did you ever want to have kids?

1519
01:00:35,275 --> 01:00:36,931
Maybe one day.

1520
01:00:39,896 --> 01:00:40,896
Oh, look.

1521
01:00:42,241 --> 01:00:43,172
You're kidding.

1522
01:00:43,206 --> 01:00:46,000
Two large specials, please.

1523
01:00:50,448 --> 01:00:51,769
I never knew charity
was such hard work.

1524
01:00:51,793 --> 01:00:53,724
But it feels really good, right?

1525
01:00:54,827 --> 01:00:55,872
Actually, there is one thing.

1526
01:00:55,896 --> 01:00:57,137
Oh, I should have figured

1527
01:00:57,172 --> 01:00:58,862
it would be
a working coffee break.

1528
01:00:58,896 --> 01:01:00,448
And that's where you're wrong.

1529
01:01:01,965 --> 01:01:03,068
Go ahead.

1530
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:04,620
- What?
- Open it.

1531
01:01:12,068 --> 01:01:14,028
I snagged these from Ann
when you weren't looking.

1532
01:01:15,655 --> 01:01:16,724
Harriet is for you.

1533
01:01:16,758 --> 01:01:17,689
Harriet.

1534
01:01:17,724 --> 01:01:19,482
Named after Harriet Quimby,

1535
01:01:19,517 --> 01:01:20,793
the first female pilot

1536
01:01:20,827 --> 01:01:23,241
to be licensed
in the United States.

1537
01:01:23,275 --> 01:01:24,275
Okay.

Oh, and who is this?

1539
01:01:30,068 --> 01:01:31,188
Why don't you do the honors?

1540
01:01:32,448 --> 01:01:33,482
Oh.

1541
01:01:33,517 --> 01:01:34,482
Lindbergh.

1542
01:01:34,517 --> 01:01:36,000
Charles Lindbergh.

1543
01:01:37,586 --> 01:01:38,689
Classic.

1544
01:01:42,517 --> 01:01:44,172
Hey there, Harriet.

1545
01:01:44,206 --> 01:01:47,206
I'm thinking about
starting my own airline.

1546
01:01:47,241 --> 01:01:48,034
Are you in?

1547
01:01:48,068 --> 01:01:50,206
Oh, I'm not so sure.

1548
01:01:50,241 --> 01:01:53,724
You seem bossy and controlling.

1549
01:01:53,758 --> 01:01:58,241
Yeah, well, at least I'm not
stubborn and opinionated.

1550
01:01:58,275 --> 01:01:59,758
I beg your pardon?

1551
01:01:59,793 --> 01:02:00,965
Hey, I am not stubborn.

1552
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:01,965
I am passionate,

1553
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,206
and there's a difference.

1554
01:02:03,241 --> 01:02:04,631
Yeah, well, you never had
an opinion you didn't share.

1555
01:02:04,655 --> 01:02:06,931
That's because
most of the time, I'm right.

1556
01:02:21,206 --> 01:02:23,000

quite the turnout.

It did.

1613
01:05:06,758 --> 01:05:08,586
But we made it happen.

1614
01:05:08,620 --> 01:05:10,413
Mm-hmm.

1615
01:05:11,862 --> 01:05:13,862
They really are
so cute together.

1616
01:05:13,896 --> 01:05:14,896
They are.

1617
01:05:16,862 --> 01:05:18,068
Uh, Megan.

1618
01:05:18,103 --> 01:05:19,724
Yes, Charlie?

1619
01:05:21,068 --> 01:05:22,827
Uh...

1620
01:05:22,862 --> 01:05:24,724
thanks so much
for making all this happen.

1621
01:05:36,931 --> 01:05:38,413
There you are.

1622
01:05:38,448 --> 01:05:39,551
Hi.

1623
01:05:39,586 --> 01:05:41,044
I think it might be time
to celebrate.

1624
01:05:41,068 --> 01:05:42,241
I don't know.

1625
01:05:42,275 --> 01:05:43,724
Isn't it a little early?

1626
01:05:43,758 --> 01:05:46,379
We're still over
a quarter shy of our goal.

1627
01:05:46,413 --> 01:05:48,827
I'm not talking
about Santa's Flight.

1628
01:05:48,862 --> 01:05:50,596
I made my official
recommendation to the board

1629
01:05:50,620 --> 01:05:52,586
who I want to name
as my VP of Operations.

1630
01:05:54,862 --> 01:05:56,034
And while I may have thought

1631
01:05:56,068 --> 01:05:58,068
I wanted the position
to go to a clone of myself...

1632
01:06:00,413 --> 01:06:01,586
it turns out

1633
01:06:01,620 --> 01:06:03,113
a healthy degree of challenge
is good for growth.

1634
01:06:03,137 --> 01:06:04,320
And I don't think
I'll ever meet someone

1635
01:06:04,344 --> 01:06:05,624
who challenges me
as much as you.

1636
01:06:09,068 --> 01:06:10,344
Wow.

1637
01:06:10,379 --> 01:06:11,931
Now you're offering me
the VP position?

1638
01:06:16,068 --> 01:06:17,310
I don't even know what to say.

1639
01:06:17,344 --> 01:06:18,517
Well, don't say anything

1640
01:06:18,551 --> 01:06:20,511
until you hear the job comes
with a slight caveat.

1641
01:06:21,172 --> 01:06:22,931
With the rapid expansion
of Connor Airlines,

1642
01:06:22,965 --> 01:06:24,034
the board felt adamant

1643
01:06:24,068 --> 01:06:25,586
the position be based
out of Portland.

1644
01:06:28,413 --> 01:06:30,694
I really went to bat for you,
but that was the compromise.

1645
01:06:34,068 --> 01:06:35,413
So I'd have to leave Snowflake.

1646
01:06:35,448 --> 01:06:38,241
Look, I know it's not
everything you wanted,

1647
01:06:38,275 --> 01:06:39,458
but this could be the beginning

1648
01:06:39,482 --> 01:06:41,282
of the new chapter
you've been thinking about.

1649
01:06:45,448 --> 01:06:47,413
I guess I have
a big decision to make.

1650
01:07:01,034 --> 01:07:02,758
Okay, so something has come up

1651
01:07:02,793 --> 01:07:05,448
that's kind of
caught me off guard.

1652
01:07:05,482 --> 01:07:07,275
So I didn't share this
with any of you

1653
01:07:07,310 --> 01:07:09,965
because I didn't really know
how to approach it.

1654
01:07:12,103 --> 01:07:13,034
Okay...

1655
01:07:13,068 --> 01:07:14,034
Christine has asked me

1656
01:07:14,068 --> 01:07:15,689
to help her run the tavern

1657
01:07:15,724 --> 01:07:17,206
as a partner.

1658
01:07:22,551 --> 01:07:23,482
That's a relief.

1659
01:07:23,517 --> 01:07:24,931
When I got your cryptic text,

1660
01:07:24,965 --> 01:07:26,044
I thought it was
something serious.

1661
01:07:26,068 --> 01:07:27,034
Dad, I mean,

1662
01:07:27,068 --> 01:07:28,389
that sounds like
a great opportunity.

1663
01:07:28,413 --> 01:07:30,448
Are you going to take her
up on it?

1664
01:07:30,482 --> 01:07:31,931
Well, I...

1665
01:07:31,965 --> 01:07:34,034
I mean, I haven't been
someone's business partner

1666
01:07:34,068 --> 01:07:35,689
since...

1667
01:07:35,724 --> 01:07:37,068
I was your mom's
business partner.

1668
01:07:38,206 --> 01:07:41,896
And with her and Christine
being best friends, I...

1669
01:07:41,931 --> 01:07:43,517
I just feel a little strange.

1670
01:07:45,206 --> 01:07:46,896
Strange how?

1671
01:07:46,931 --> 01:07:48,068
Well, I'm a little worried

1672
01:07:48,103 --> 01:07:51,068
that Christine may have
some expectations

1673
01:07:51,103 --> 01:07:52,862
beyond just being
business partners,

1674
01:07:52,896 --> 01:07:55,896
and I wouldn't want
to upset you guys.

1675
01:07:55,931 --> 01:07:57,068
Upset?

1676
01:07:59,206 --> 01:08:00,838
You think if something
develops romantically

1677
01:08:00,862 --> 01:08:01,827
with you and Christine,

1678
01:08:01,862 --> 01:08:02,862
it's cheating on Mom?

1679
01:08:04,413 --> 01:08:05,413
Oh, Dad.

1680
01:08:05,448 --> 01:08:06,689
Dad, that's silly.

1681
01:08:06,724 --> 01:08:09,172
I mean, Mom would want for you
what we all want.

1682
01:08:09,206 --> 01:08:11,931
For you to have a life
filled with contentment.

1683
01:08:13,620 --> 01:08:14,551
Really?

1684
01:08:14,586 --> 01:08:16,517
If two people
truly love one another,

1685
01:08:16,551 --> 01:08:18,231
all they want
is for the other to be happy.

1686
01:08:21,517 --> 01:08:22,877
It's what we all
want for you, Dad.

1687
01:08:26,758 --> 01:08:28,896
Okay.

1688
01:08:28,931 --> 01:08:29,965
All right.

1689
01:08:32,793 --> 01:08:34,862
I just read
your email to the board.

1690
01:08:34,896 --> 01:08:35,862
Is it true?

1691
01:08:35,896 --> 01:08:37,310
Did you reverse
your recommendation

1692
01:08:37,344 --> 01:08:39,241
to move headquarters to Helena?

1693
01:08:39,275 --> 01:08:41,344
You presented a strong argument,

1694
01:08:41,379 --> 01:08:42,344
and they agreed.

1695
01:08:42,379 --> 01:08:43,586
However, the VP job

1696
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:45,010
will still be based
out of Portland,

1697
01:08:45,034 --> 01:08:46,000
and if you accept the position,

1698
01:08:46,034 --> 01:08:47,034
you need to realize

1699
01:08:47,068 --> 01:08:48,344
that sometimes you win,

1700
01:08:48,379 --> 01:08:49,379
and sometimes you lose.

1701
01:08:50,896 --> 01:08:52,758
What is this?

1702
01:08:52,793 --> 01:08:53,758
The final cost analysis.

1703
01:08:53,793 --> 01:08:55,068
We have no choice

1704
01:08:55,103 --> 01:08:56,482
but to make some cuts
in personnel

1705
01:08:56,517 --> 01:08:58,758
by combining
marketing departments.

1706
01:08:58,793 --> 01:08:59,931
You want to lay off Charlie.

1707
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,206
I'm sorry, Jenny.

1708
01:09:02,241 --> 01:09:03,206
But I don't expect you
to be the one

1709
01:09:03,241 --> 01:09:04,206
to break the news.

1710
01:09:04,241 --> 01:09:06,275
No. No, it needs
to come from me.

1711
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:08,931
I know Charlie's heart

1712
01:09:08,965 --> 01:09:10,182
hasn't been in the job
for a while.

1713
01:09:10,206 --> 01:09:12,034
From time to time,
he lets things slide,

1714
01:09:12,068 --> 01:09:15,172
and until now,
I've turned a blind eye.

1715
01:09:16,241 --> 01:09:18,121
Does that mean you're accepting
the VP position?

1716
01:09:22,344 --> 01:09:24,241
As hard as it is
to move away from my family...

1717
01:09:26,896 --> 01:09:28,896
I can't turn down
this kind of opportunity.

1718
01:09:28,931 --> 01:09:30,517
Are you sure?

1719
01:09:30,551 --> 01:09:33,448
Sundancer's part
of a new family now.

1720
01:09:33,482 --> 01:09:34,596
And we can either grow with it

1721
01:09:34,620 --> 01:09:37,379
or move on
to something different.

1722
01:09:38,862 --> 01:09:40,206
On a more positive note,

1723
01:09:40,241 --> 01:09:42,448
where are we on sponsors
with Santa's Flight?

1724
01:09:42,482 --> 01:09:45,482
We had such a strong turnout
with the benefit last night,

1725
01:09:45,517 --> 01:09:47,724
but we are cutting it close.

1726
01:09:47,758 --> 01:09:49,482
With the midnight deadline
looming,

1727
01:09:49,517 --> 01:09:51,862
I just can't help but feel
like I haven't done enough.

1728
01:09:51,896 --> 01:09:55,551
Jenny, everyone put in 110%.

1729
01:09:55,586 --> 01:09:57,655
All we can do now
is stay positive

1730
01:09:57,689 --> 01:09:59,241
and see what happens.

1731
01:10:12,241 --> 01:10:13,310
Frank,

1732
01:10:13,344 --> 01:10:16,034
are you moonlighting
at the local flower shop?

1733
01:10:16,068 --> 01:10:19,344
Well, these are for you.

1734
01:10:20,344 --> 01:10:22,000
I feel that I may have come off

1735
01:10:22,034 --> 01:10:23,862
as a little hesitant

1736
01:10:23,896 --> 01:10:25,424
when you asked me
to come work with you.

1737
01:10:25,448 --> 01:10:28,413
And you were hoping
that'll take the sting off?

1738
01:10:30,620 --> 01:10:32,000
Actually, I'm here

1739
01:10:32,034 --> 01:10:34,724
because I'm hoping
that your offer still stands

1740
01:10:34,758 --> 01:10:36,931
to come in as a partner
at the tavern.

1741
01:10:36,965 --> 01:10:37,896
Mm-hmm.

1742
01:10:37,931 --> 01:10:40,758
Okay.

1743
01:10:40,793 --> 01:10:42,206
Well, then before I accept,

1744
01:10:42,241 --> 01:10:43,689
I have just
one important question.

1745
01:10:46,206 --> 01:10:49,793
What is the restaurant's policy
on co-workers dating?

1746
01:10:52,068 --> 01:10:54,689
We don't have a policy.

1747
01:10:55,931 --> 01:10:58,206
Why do you ask?

1748
01:10:58,241 --> 01:11:04,517
Well, I should warn you
that I may be a little rusty

1749
01:11:04,551 --> 01:11:07,965
because I forgot
to give you this the other day.

1750
01:11:15,620 --> 01:11:17,241
Maybe you're not
so rusty after all.

1751
01:11:30,241 --> 01:11:31,206
Yes!

1752
01:11:31,241 --> 01:11:33,586
Oh, my gosh,
we've reached our goal.

1753
01:11:33,620 --> 01:11:35,206
Mom! Come and take
a look at this.

1754
01:11:36,620 --> 01:11:37,631
Congratulations, everyone.

1755
01:11:37,655 --> 01:11:38,586
We did it!

1756
01:11:38,620 --> 01:11:40,448
Cheers!

1757
01:11:40,482 --> 01:11:43,000
Santa's Flight officially
takes flight tomorrow.

1758
01:11:43,034 --> 01:11:44,241
Thank you, all,

1759
01:11:44,275 --> 01:11:46,724
from the bottom of my heart
for all of your hard work.

1760
01:11:46,758 --> 01:11:48,517
This would not
have been possible

1761
01:11:48,551 --> 01:11:50,655
without each
and every one of you.

1762
01:11:50,689 --> 01:11:51,689
Cheers.

1763
01:11:54,068 --> 01:11:55,137
O ye of little faith.

1764
01:11:55,172 --> 01:11:57,344
Personally, I always knew
we'd reach our goal.

1765
01:11:57,379 --> 01:11:59,344
Yeah, barely.

1766
01:11:59,379 --> 01:12:01,217
If it wasn't for that
last-minute anonymous donation,

1767
01:12:01,241 --> 01:12:02,137
we would be cooked.

1768
01:12:02,172 --> 01:12:03,413
Well, hold on.

1769
01:12:03,448 --> 01:12:05,424
We still had six hours
until our midnight deadline.

1770
01:12:05,448 --> 01:12:08,137
I suggest we take
whatever extra we make

1771
01:12:08,172 --> 01:12:10,586
and roll it over into
next year's Santa's Flight.

1772
01:12:10,620 --> 01:12:11,586
Actually,

1773
01:12:11,620 --> 01:12:13,034
now that the board has seen

1774
01:12:13,068 --> 01:12:14,355
we can make this program
a success,

1775
01:12:14,379 --> 01:12:18,103
Connor Airlines has decided
to place donation stations

1776
01:12:18,137 --> 01:12:20,034
outside our terminals
for travelers

1777
01:12:20,068 --> 01:12:21,251
right after
Thanksgiving holiday.

1778
01:12:21,275 --> 01:12:23,517
And if we're ever
shy of our goal,

1779
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:26,034
Connor Airlines
will cover the difference

1780
01:12:26,068 --> 01:12:28,689
so Santa's Flight
never gets grounded.

1781
01:12:28,724 --> 01:12:29,689
To Santa's Flight!

1782
01:12:29,724 --> 01:12:30,827
To Santa's Flight.

1783
01:12:30,862 --> 01:12:31,862
To Santa's Flight!

1784
01:12:33,586 --> 01:12:34,689
Matt, that is...

1785
01:12:34,724 --> 01:12:35,964
that is such a generous gesture.

1786
01:12:37,689 --> 01:12:38,862
Oh, wait, I think you forgot

1787
01:12:38,896 --> 01:12:41,931
to run it up the flagpole
to your new VP.

1788
01:12:41,965 --> 01:12:43,205
Maybe we should take a meeting.

1789
01:12:47,068 --> 01:12:48,413
Okay, see you in a bit.

1790
01:12:50,965 --> 01:12:52,724
Hey, Meg.

1791
01:12:52,758 --> 01:12:53,724
I was thinking,

1792
01:12:53,758 --> 01:12:55,068
now that Dad's moving on

1793
01:12:55,103 --> 01:12:56,517
and Santa's Flight
is back on track,

1794
01:12:56,551 --> 01:12:58,241
that maybe you want
to go celebrate.

1795
01:12:59,413 --> 01:13:00,620
I would.

1796
01:13:00,655 --> 01:13:02,375
It's just Ann invited me
for a girls' night.

1797
01:13:06,103 --> 01:13:07,413
That's... that's great.

1798
01:13:07,448 --> 01:13:10,620
Um, have fun.

1799
01:13:11,965 --> 01:13:12,965
I will.

1800
01:13:18,379 --> 01:13:19,931
When you invited me
to a wrap party,

1801
01:13:19,965 --> 01:13:21,700
I was figuring something
a little more celebratory.

1802
01:13:21,724 --> 01:13:24,000
We just have to finish
wrapping all these gifts

1803
01:13:24,034 --> 01:13:25,000
for Santa's Flight,

1804
01:13:25,034 --> 01:13:26,000
and I thought it could be fun.

1805
01:13:26,034 --> 01:13:27,827
And I've done
most of them already.

1806
01:13:27,862 --> 01:13:30,137
So...

1807
01:13:30,172 --> 01:13:32,241
do you have any idea
who our secret donor was

1808
01:13:32,275 --> 01:13:33,482
who threw us over the top?

1809
01:13:33,517 --> 01:13:36,655
I assumed it was
one of your board members

1810
01:13:36,689 --> 01:13:38,379
whose heart grew
three times the size

1811
01:13:38,413 --> 01:13:40,034
when he visited Chloe's website.

1812
01:13:42,034 --> 01:13:43,517
Uh, finger, please.

1813
01:13:45,103 --> 01:13:46,448
Right here.

1814
01:13:52,206 --> 01:13:53,517
Hold still.

1815
01:13:53,551 --> 01:13:55,832
You know I'm going to need
that finger back at some point?

1816
01:13:56,931 --> 01:13:57,931
Stay still.

1817
01:14:09,206 --> 01:14:10,620
Hey, Hayley.

1818
01:14:10,655 --> 01:14:12,862
What's up?

1819
01:14:12,896 --> 01:14:14,206
What kind of a problem?

1820
01:14:14,241 --> 01:14:15,482
Um...

1821
01:14:15,517 --> 01:14:16,482
hold on.

1822
01:14:16,517 --> 01:14:17,689
Let me put you on speaker.

1823
01:14:17,724 --> 01:14:20,689
The auxiliary power unit...

1824
01:14:20,724 --> 01:14:21,586
It's completely blown.

1825
01:14:21,620 --> 01:14:22,700
We have to ground the plane.

1826
01:14:22,724 --> 01:14:24,206
Which plane is it?

1827
01:14:24,241 --> 01:14:26,001
The one you're supposed
to be flying tomorrow

1828
01:14:26,034 --> 01:14:27,551
for Santa's Flight.

1829
01:14:29,068 --> 01:14:30,034
How long will it take to fix?

1830
01:14:30,068 --> 01:14:31,068
The maintenance crew

1831
01:14:31,103 --> 01:14:32,758
is short-staffed
with holiday hours.

1832
01:14:32,793 --> 01:14:34,344
With the manpower I've got,

1833
01:14:34,379 --> 01:14:35,758
it'll take a day.

1834
01:14:35,793 --> 01:14:37,034
Maybe two.

1835
01:14:37,068 --> 01:14:38,389
Okay. We're going to figure
something out,

1836
01:14:38,413 --> 01:14:39,586
and we will call you back.

1837
01:14:40,793 --> 01:14:42,172
Um, what do we do now?

1838
01:14:42,206 --> 01:14:44,379
All of our other planes
are all in use.

1839
01:14:45,517 --> 01:14:47,251
- What about your private plane?
- It seats eight people, max.

1840
01:14:47,275 --> 01:14:49,413
Well then, can't we just

1841
01:14:49,448 --> 01:14:50,976
cancel one of our other flights
for tomorrow

1842
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:52,068
to make this happen?

1843
01:14:52,103 --> 01:14:53,872
It's not possible, Jenny.
It's Christmas weekend.

1844
01:14:53,896 --> 01:14:55,931
Well, we can't just give up.

1845
01:14:55,965 --> 01:14:57,862
Who says I'm giving up?

1846
01:14:57,896 --> 01:14:59,700
We just have to come up
with a practical solution.

1847
01:14:59,724 --> 01:15:00,724
Right.

1848
01:15:00,758 --> 01:15:02,310
Practical.

1849
01:15:02,344 --> 01:15:03,896
So what do you suggest, hmm?

1850
01:15:03,931 --> 01:15:06,448
Some half-hearted gift exchange
in an airplane hangar?

1851
01:15:09,172 --> 01:15:10,652
What else
would you have me do, Jenny?

1852
01:15:11,724 --> 01:15:13,113
I can't make something happen
that's beyond my control.

1853
01:15:13,137 --> 01:15:14,103
I still have to answer
to the board.

1854
01:15:14,137 --> 01:15:15,206
Oh, right.

1855
01:15:15,241 --> 01:15:16,655
You know, Matt, I am not naive.

1856
01:15:16,689 --> 01:15:17,724
I know the only reason

1857
01:15:17,758 --> 01:15:20,034
you and your precious board
agreed to help

1858
01:15:20,068 --> 01:15:21,458
was for all the good press
you could get

1859
01:15:21,482 --> 01:15:22,551
for Connor Airways.

1860
01:15:24,965 --> 01:15:27,172
Well, the bottom line is
I still have a business to run.

1861
01:15:28,827 --> 01:15:30,034
But I can't believe

1862
01:15:30,068 --> 01:15:31,769
you really think that's why
I came aboard to help.

1863
01:15:31,793 --> 01:15:34,034
Honestly, Matt, I don't know
what to think anymore.

1864
01:15:35,275 --> 01:15:37,793
But what I do know

1865
01:15:37,827 --> 01:15:39,379
is that I do
my best thinking alone.

1866
01:15:40,586 --> 01:15:41,724
Excuse me.

1867
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,448
I messed up.

1868
01:16:03,482 --> 01:16:04,665
Hey, Matt and I got in a fight,

1869
01:16:04,689 --> 01:16:07,034
and he's probably
on his way back to Portland

1870
01:16:07,068 --> 01:16:08,379
to hire a new VP,

1871
01:16:08,413 --> 01:16:09,413
and we worked so hard,

1872
01:16:09,448 --> 01:16:12,068
and it's all falling apart.

1873
01:16:12,103 --> 01:16:13,586
And with the plane downed,

1874
01:16:13,620 --> 01:16:16,068
I have no choice
but to cancel Santa's Flight.

1875
01:16:16,103 --> 01:16:17,863
I didn't want to disappoint
all those kids...

1876
01:16:19,344 --> 01:16:21,241
but I will call
all the donors in the morning,

1877
01:16:21,275 --> 01:16:23,965
and let them know
that Santa's Flight is off.

1878
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,379
I'm sorry.

1879
01:16:32,275 --> 01:16:33,586
Yes.

1880
01:16:33,620 --> 01:16:36,931
Yes, Mr. Connor,
I know I'm asking for a miracle.

1881
01:16:36,965 --> 01:16:40,172
But right now, "can't"
is not in my vocabulary.

1882
01:16:46,034 --> 01:16:47,344
Then tell the board

1883
01:16:47,379 --> 01:16:49,448
they can start looking
for a new CEO.

1884
01:17:01,517 --> 01:17:03,137
Hey, sweetie.

1885
01:17:03,172 --> 01:17:05,241
Wait, what are you guys
doing here so early?

1886
01:17:05,275 --> 01:17:06,241
Here to see you.

1887
01:17:06,275 --> 01:17:08,413
I appreciate it,

1888
01:17:08,448 --> 01:17:09,527
but I doubt there's anything

1889
01:17:09,551 --> 01:17:10,838
either of you could
say to cheer me up.

1890
01:17:10,862 --> 01:17:12,620
Come on, sis. It's not that bad.

1891
01:17:19,551 --> 01:17:20,562
I took one of the collectors

1892
01:17:20,586 --> 01:17:22,379
up on their offer
to buy Mom's pin.

1893
01:17:23,206 --> 01:17:24,586
Wait...
you're the anonymous donor?

1894
01:17:26,551 --> 01:17:28,551
I had to.

1895
01:17:28,586 --> 01:17:29,931
For Mom's legacy.

1896
01:17:29,965 --> 01:17:31,827
But it turns out
it was all for nothing.

1897
01:17:31,862 --> 01:17:33,551
I was just going
to call all the families

1898
01:17:33,586 --> 01:17:34,838
to let them know
today is canceled.

1899
01:17:34,862 --> 01:17:36,582
I didn't have the heart
to do it last night.

1900
01:17:37,827 --> 01:17:39,044
Well, it's a good thing
you didn't,

1901
01:17:39,068 --> 01:17:40,079
because you would have had
to call them all back again

1902
01:17:40,103 --> 01:17:41,068
this morning.

1903
01:17:41,103 --> 01:17:42,241
What?

1904
01:17:42,275 --> 01:17:43,724
That's why we're here.

1905
01:17:43,758 --> 01:17:46,344
While Matt's jet
may not have been big enough

1906
01:17:46,379 --> 01:17:48,068
to host Santa's Flight,

1907
01:17:48,103 --> 01:17:49,379
he did use it to fly in

1908
01:17:49,413 --> 01:17:51,137
a secondary maintenance crew
last night.

1909
01:17:51,172 --> 01:17:52,172
He did?

1910
01:17:52,206 --> 01:17:53,241
Mm-hmm.

1911
01:17:53,275 --> 01:17:54,758
Wait, the board
agreed to do that?

1912
01:17:55,862 --> 01:17:57,448
He put his job on the line.

1913
01:17:57,482 --> 01:17:59,586
And that crew
worked all through the night...

1914
01:17:59,620 --> 01:18:02,620
And Santa's Flight plane
is ready for takeoff.

1915
01:18:02,655 --> 01:18:04,068
What?

1916
01:18:04,103 --> 01:18:05,620
I can't believe it.

1917
01:18:06,586 --> 01:18:07,862
I have to get the flight ready.

1918
01:18:09,137 --> 01:18:10,068
Come on in,
buckle your seat belts,

1919
01:18:10,103 --> 01:18:11,724
put your bags in the overheads,

1920
01:18:11,758 --> 01:18:15,379
and, okay, welcome, everyone,
to Santa's Flight.

1921
01:18:17,896 --> 01:18:19,206
Merry Christmas to everyone,

1922
01:18:19,241 --> 01:18:20,758
and a very important question.

1923
01:18:20,793 --> 01:18:22,513
Anybody here
on Santa's good list this year?

1924
01:18:23,896 --> 01:18:26,034
Okay, that is a lot of hands.

1925
01:18:26,068 --> 01:18:28,241
Uh, Chloe,
can we get the big basket?

1926
01:18:28,275 --> 01:18:29,551
Hello, everyone,

1927
01:18:29,586 --> 01:18:31,068
and welcome to Santa's Flight.

1928
01:18:31,103 --> 01:18:33,517
We are thrilled
to have you on board today.

1929
01:18:33,551 --> 01:18:35,482
So, everyone,
buckle your seat belts,

1930
01:18:35,517 --> 01:18:36,586
because we're off.

1931
01:18:36,620 --> 01:18:38,448
Here we go!

1932
01:18:43,827 --> 01:18:46,034
And now, lunch will be served.

1933
01:18:49,689 --> 01:18:50,931
Hi, folks.

1934
01:18:51,931 --> 01:18:52,862
Great job.

1935
01:18:52,896 --> 01:18:54,241
Hi, everybody.

1936
01:18:54,275 --> 01:18:55,586
Happy holidays.

1937
01:18:55,620 --> 01:18:57,793
Hi, kiddos.

1938
01:18:57,827 --> 01:18:58,862
And look, everybody.

1939
01:18:58,896 --> 01:18:59,862
There's Santa.

1940
01:18:59,896 --> 01:19:02,586
Hello, Captain Beckett.

1941
01:19:02,620 --> 01:19:05,103
Your ride is almost
as smooth as my sleigh.

1942
01:19:05,137 --> 01:19:06,137
What can I say?

1943
01:19:09,413 --> 01:19:10,344
Matt?

1944
01:19:10,379 --> 01:19:12,241
I thought you had
a flight to catch.

1945
01:19:12,275 --> 01:19:14,034
I did.

1946
01:19:14,068 --> 01:19:15,068
Santa's Flight.

1947
01:19:16,068 --> 01:19:19,517
Matt, how did you make
all of this happen?

1948
01:19:22,620 --> 01:19:24,448
Hey, Santa?

1949
01:19:24,482 --> 01:19:26,172
The kids are waiting for you.

1950
01:19:26,206 --> 01:19:27,206
Duty calls.

1951
01:19:28,965 --> 01:19:31,241
Ho-ho-ho!

1952
01:19:31,275 --> 01:19:32,424
All right, who's ready
for some presents?

1953
01:19:32,448 --> 01:19:34,044
I heard there are some kids here
who like presents.

1954
01:19:34,068 --> 01:19:35,596
Do you like presents?
Do you like presents?

1955
01:19:35,620 --> 01:19:38,586
Well, lucky for you,
I have presents for everybody.

1956
01:19:38,620 --> 01:19:41,034
♪ Are you ready for Christmas? ♪

1957
01:19:41,068 --> 01:19:42,034
♪ Are you decking the halls?

1958
01:19:42,068 --> 01:19:43,034
Okay, everyone.

1959
01:19:43,068 --> 01:19:44,379
Welcome to the North Pole.

1960
01:19:44,413 --> 01:19:46,206
If you look over to your right,

1961
01:19:46,241 --> 01:19:47,596
you will see Santa's own
very lovely...

1962
01:19:47,620 --> 01:19:48,620
Okay, everyone,

1963
01:19:48,655 --> 01:19:50,517
make a disorderly line
over by Santa.

1964
01:19:50,551 --> 01:19:51,482
Excuse me.

1965
01:19:51,517 --> 01:19:52,586
Hey, Santa Claus.

1966
01:19:52,620 --> 01:19:53,872
Everyone, this is
my best friend, Santa Claus.

1967
01:19:53,896 --> 01:19:55,344
I'm Farley the Elf.

1968
01:19:55,379 --> 01:19:56,596
It's very wonderful
to meet all of you today.

1969
01:19:56,620 --> 01:19:58,068
Hi, everyone.

1970
01:19:58,103 --> 01:19:59,793
Hi, Santa.

1971
01:20:02,689 --> 01:20:05,551
♪ You'll be counting
down the days ♪

1972
01:20:05,586 --> 01:20:08,517
♪ Till the holidays

1973
01:20:08,551 --> 01:20:11,241
♪ We will sing
ring-a-ding-ding-ding ♪

1974
01:20:11,275 --> 01:20:14,413
♪ Are you ready to celebrate?

1975
01:20:14,448 --> 01:20:17,448
♪ Everyone is coming home...

1976
01:20:18,413 --> 01:20:19,689
Focus.

1977
01:20:20,896 --> 01:20:21,862
I did it!

1978
01:20:21,896 --> 01:20:23,068
Mom, I won.

1979
01:20:23,103 --> 01:20:24,275
You won.

1980
01:20:24,310 --> 01:20:26,068
Very good.

1981
01:20:26,103 --> 01:20:27,310
Here you go.

1982
01:20:27,344 --> 01:20:28,931
Oh, whoa.

1983
01:20:28,965 --> 01:20:31,620
Where are we going to put that?

1984
01:20:33,103 --> 01:20:34,379
You can sleep in this.

1985
01:20:34,413 --> 01:20:35,206
Hey there, mister.

1986
01:20:35,241 --> 01:20:37,275
Wow.

1987
01:20:37,310 --> 01:20:38,590
That's some impressive hardware.

1988
01:20:38,620 --> 01:20:39,655
Yeah.

1989
01:20:39,689 --> 01:20:40,862
So listen,

1990
01:20:40,896 --> 01:20:42,251
are you really serious
about being a pilot someday?

1991
01:20:42,275 --> 01:20:43,241
Totally.

1992
01:20:43,275 --> 01:20:44,551
Really?

1993
01:20:44,586 --> 01:20:46,044
Because I want to make
a deal with you

1994
01:20:46,068 --> 01:20:47,034
to help make
your dream come true.

1995
01:20:47,068 --> 01:20:48,172
How?

1996
01:20:48,206 --> 01:20:49,137
For your part,

1997
01:20:49,172 --> 01:20:50,068
all you've got to do

1998
01:20:50,103 --> 01:20:51,148
is keep your grades up
in school.

1999
01:20:51,172 --> 01:20:52,482
For someone as smart as you,

2000
01:20:52,517 --> 01:20:53,665
I don't think
that's going to be a problem.

2001
01:20:53,689 --> 01:20:54,758
Okay.

2002
01:20:54,793 --> 01:20:56,689
And then, when you're ready
to go to college,

2003
01:20:56,724 --> 01:20:58,137
your mom is going to call me,

2004
01:20:58,172 --> 01:21:00,344
and Connor Airways
is going to pay your tuition.

2005
01:21:05,241 --> 01:21:07,000
Really, Mr. Hansen,
you'll do that?

2006
01:21:07,034 --> 01:21:08,862
Only if Benjamin
agrees to the deal.

2007
01:21:09,620 --> 01:21:10,724
Shake on it?

2008
01:21:12,862 --> 01:21:14,000
No. Let's hug on it.

2009
01:21:19,068 --> 01:21:20,068
Merry Christmas, Captain.

2010
01:21:29,379 --> 01:21:30,482
Congratulations, sis.

2011
01:21:30,517 --> 01:21:32,277
You're going to be
the best VP of operations.

2012
01:21:32,310 --> 01:21:35,034
Thanks, but now comes
the hard part.

2013
01:21:35,068 --> 01:21:37,344
It's up to me
to oversee budget cuts.

2014
01:21:37,379 --> 01:21:38,517
Don't worry about that.

2015
01:21:38,551 --> 01:21:41,034
Hey, nobody knows
the airline biz like you.

2016
01:21:41,068 --> 01:21:43,241
Which brings me
to my next order of business.

2017
01:21:45,344 --> 01:21:47,344
Hey, you're twirling your...

2018
01:21:47,379 --> 01:21:48,586
No.

2019
01:21:48,620 --> 01:21:50,044
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Okay, don't say another word.

2020
01:21:50,068 --> 01:21:51,079
Okay, I'm afraid
that I have no choice.

2021
01:21:51,103 --> 01:21:52,137
Please do not make this

2022
01:21:52,172 --> 01:21:53,724
any harder on me
than it already is.

2023
01:21:53,758 --> 01:21:54,838
Hey, you don't have to do this.

2024
01:21:54,862 --> 01:21:55,931
Yeah, actually, I do.

2025
01:21:55,965 --> 01:21:57,310
No, no, I promise.

2026
01:21:57,344 --> 01:21:58,734
If you let me say
what I have to say,

2027
01:21:58,758 --> 01:21:59,896
and I promise you...

2028
01:21:59,931 --> 01:22:01,044
Charlie, there's absolutely
nothing you could say

2029
01:22:01,068 --> 01:22:02,000
that's going to change
what I have to say.

2030
01:22:02,034 --> 01:22:04,137
Jenny...

2031
01:22:04,172 --> 01:22:05,586
I quit.

2032
01:22:09,620 --> 01:22:11,068
I stand corrected.

2033
01:22:11,103 --> 01:22:12,103
What?

2034
01:22:15,034 --> 01:22:16,172
I had a meeting

2035
01:22:16,206 --> 01:22:17,700
with the principal
at Snowflake Elementary.

2036
01:22:17,724 --> 01:22:19,448
- Mm-hmm.
- And...

2037
01:22:19,482 --> 01:22:22,034
he offered me a job
teaching music in January.

2038
01:22:22,068 --> 01:22:23,068
Charlie, really?

2039
01:22:25,689 --> 01:22:27,482
I thought a lot about
what you said,

2040
01:22:27,517 --> 01:22:29,482
and you're right.

2041
01:22:29,517 --> 01:22:31,241
I think people can change.

2042
01:22:31,275 --> 01:22:32,275
If they have a reason.

2043
01:22:33,379 --> 01:22:34,344
I'm happy for you.

2044
01:22:34,379 --> 01:22:35,482
No, no.

2045
01:22:35,517 --> 01:22:37,862
Because all of this happened
because of you.

2046
01:22:37,896 --> 01:22:40,034
Because you've always had
my back.

2047
01:22:40,068 --> 01:22:41,172
I don't know why,

2048
01:22:41,206 --> 01:22:43,206
but for whatever reason,
I was too blind to see it.

2049
01:22:44,965 --> 01:22:46,586
So I don't know how you feel,

2050
01:22:46,620 --> 01:22:48,896
I don't know
how things are between us,

2051
01:22:48,931 --> 01:22:51,482
but I know that
if I don't do this now,

2052
01:22:51,517 --> 01:22:53,241
I'm always going to regret.

2053
01:22:53,275 --> 01:22:54,344
Megan...

2054
01:22:56,241 --> 01:22:58,551
I...

2055
01:22:59,689 --> 01:23:00,689
What?

2056
01:23:02,620 --> 01:23:03,620
Will you marry me?

2057
01:23:05,862 --> 01:23:07,068
Please?

2058
01:23:08,068 --> 01:23:09,724
Let me show you
the man I can become.

2059
01:23:13,206 --> 01:23:16,206
Only if you keep a big part of
that goofy guy I love so much.

2060
01:23:16,241 --> 01:23:18,931
Yes, yes, yes!

2061
01:23:24,448 --> 01:23:26,729
Well, I see that worked out
a little better than expected.

2062
01:23:27,862 --> 01:23:28,862
Charlie.

2063
01:23:31,206 --> 01:23:33,034
Oh, this is so fun!

2064
01:23:34,793 --> 01:23:38,586
See? Christmas really is
all about the gift of giving.

2065
01:23:39,551 --> 01:23:41,862
On that note, this is for you.

2066
01:23:48,931 --> 01:23:49,896
Matt, how did you...

2067
01:23:49,931 --> 01:23:51,137
I saw it was missing

2068
01:23:51,172 --> 01:23:52,182
and chased down the collector

2069
01:23:52,206 --> 01:23:53,172
and convinced him
it belonged to you.

2070
01:23:53,206 --> 01:23:55,206
Really?

2071
01:23:55,241 --> 01:23:56,758
You must have been
pretty convincing.

2072
01:24:00,586 --> 01:24:02,827
Matt, you have no idea
what this means to me.

2073
01:24:03,931 --> 01:24:04,931
Actually, I do.

2074
01:24:07,620 --> 01:24:08,586
Then you'll also understand

2075
01:24:08,620 --> 01:24:10,310
that I cannot accept
the VP position.

2076
01:24:13,344 --> 01:24:14,424
You belong here, don't you?

2077
01:24:17,758 --> 01:24:20,310
I thought so, too, but no.

2078
01:24:23,344 --> 01:24:24,551
I belong up there.

2079
01:24:24,586 --> 01:24:27,655
Flying was always my passion,

2080
01:24:27,689 --> 01:24:30,517
and I guess it took
someone like you

2081
01:24:30,551 --> 01:24:31,689
to help me realize that.

2082
01:24:32,689 --> 01:24:33,931
Then come to Portland.

2083
01:24:33,965 --> 01:24:36,137
Take one of
my international routes.

2084
01:24:36,172 --> 01:24:37,389
Finally start seeing the world.

2085
01:24:37,413 --> 01:24:39,310
What? You'd do that?

2086
01:24:39,344 --> 01:24:41,655
Yeah.

2087
01:24:41,689 --> 01:24:43,344
Maybe I'll get to take
some time off

2088
01:24:43,379 --> 01:24:44,551
and see the world, too.

2089
01:24:47,517 --> 01:24:48,517
Yeah, I'd like that.

2090
01:24:48,551 --> 01:24:50,379
Jenny, I see the way
you do things,

2091
01:24:50,413 --> 01:24:52,453
and it's just so clear to me
what I've been missing.

2092
01:24:53,517 --> 01:24:55,275
It can't just be
about the bottom line.

2093
01:24:56,448 --> 01:24:58,896
Because, really,
my bottom line is...

2094
01:25:02,310 --> 01:25:04,241
I think I'm falling
in love with you.

2095
01:25:04,275 --> 01:25:06,000
I'm ready to find my happy.

2096
01:25:07,310 --> 01:25:08,448
Just let go of the wheel

2097
01:25:08,482 --> 01:25:10,103
and let somebody else
fly the plane.

2098
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:14,000
I got you.

2099
01:25:15,068 --> 01:25:16,628
I was hoping
you were going to say that.
