1
00:00:41,154 --> 00:00:43,247
<i>You know,
there's nothing like the experience...</i>

2
00:00:43,323 --> 00:00:46,258
<i>of raising your first dog.</i>

3
00:00:46,326 --> 00:00:50,422
<i>Simple joy of walking side by side</i>
<i>with your buddy out in the fresh air...</i>

4
00:00:50,497 --> 00:00:52,522
<i>throwin' a stick.</i>

5
00:00:52,599 --> 00:00:56,228
<i>Spending some quiet time-</i>
<i>just you and your very best friend.</i>

6
00:01:02,709 --> 00:01:05,610
<i>Of course, that wasn't</i> my <i>experience.</i>

7
00:01:05,679 --> 00:01:08,204
<i>- That kid's not even me.</i>

8
00:01:12,386 --> 00:01:16,007
<i>That's me, and that crazy</i>
<i>hound I'm chasing is Marley...</i>

9
00:01:16,089 --> 00:01:19,352
<i>- the world's worst dog-</i>
- Sorry!

10
00:01:19,426 --> 00:01:21,360
<i>- Or so I thought.</i>
- Marley!

11
00:01:21,428 --> 00:01:23,794
<i>But our story begins</i>
<i>before Marley was born-</i>

12
00:01:23,864 --> 00:01:26,765
<i>Four years before,</i>
<i>on my wedding day-</i>

13
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:29,961
<i>which also happened to be the day</i>
<i>of the worst freak spring blizzard...</i>

14
00:01:30,036 --> 00:01:31,970
<i>in the history of southern Michigan.</i>

15
00:01:32,038 --> 00:01:35,303
<i>Same day our car broke down.</i>
<i>We didn't care.</i>

16
00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:37,741
Ooh. God, that feels so good.

17
00:01:39,346 --> 00:01:41,439
Ohh!

18
00:01:41,515 --> 00:01:43,449
Wow. So, what do you think-

19
00:01:43,517 --> 00:01:45,951
What do you think that means-
a blizzard on your wedding day?

20
00:01:46,019 --> 00:01:48,214
Is that good luck?
Is that bad luck?

21
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:50,688
I think- I think it's good luck.

22
00:01:52,993 --> 00:01:55,655
- How did I get you?
- What?

23
00:01:55,729 --> 00:01:59,324
No, honestly. How did I-
How did I get that lucky?

24
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:01,993
Well, you know...

25
00:02:02,068 --> 00:02:04,195
I get asked that question all the time.

26
00:02:04,271 --> 00:02:07,138
Come on.

27
00:02:07,207 --> 00:02:09,835
Are you kidding, honey?

28
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,844
You're part of the plan.

29
00:02:11,912 --> 00:02:15,541
- The plan?
- Mm-hmm. My plan. Step one-

30
00:02:15,615 --> 00:02:20,985
Meet an incredibly sweet,
smart, sexy man.

31
00:02:21,054 --> 00:02:23,488
Done. Step two?

32
00:02:23,557 --> 00:02:25,991
Marry you instead.

33
00:02:26,059 --> 00:02:29,119
Oh, now-And step three-

34
00:02:29,196 --> 00:02:32,029
- No, I don't think I can take any more steps.
- You don't wanna hear step three?

35
00:02:32,098 --> 00:02:34,032
- Yeah. What's step three?
- It's easy.

36
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:37,069
- Be gentle.
- Move someplace warmer.

37
00:02:37,137 --> 00:02:39,002
I knew you were gonna say that.

38
00:03:02,829 --> 00:03:06,731
<i>Shiny, happy people laughing</i>

39
00:03:10,804 --> 00:03:14,535
<i>Meet me in the crowd</i>

40
00:03:14,608 --> 00:03:18,442
<i>People, people</i>

41
00:03:18,512 --> 00:03:21,709
<i>Throw your love around</i>

42
00:03:21,781 --> 00:03:26,115
<i>Love me, love me</i>

43
00:03:26,186 --> 00:03:29,747
<i>Take it into town</i>

44
00:03:29,823 --> 00:03:33,657
<i>Happy, happy</i>

45
00:03:33,727 --> 00:03:36,753
<i>Put it in the ground</i>

46
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:41,665
<i>Where the flowers grow</i>

47
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:48,940
<i>Gold and silver shine</i>

48
00:03:52,913 --> 00:03:56,679
<i>Shiny, happy people</i>
<i>holding hands</i>

49
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:59,878
<i>Shiny, happy people</i>

50
00:03:59,953 --> 00:04:02,786
- Thank you.
- All right, you know you got this, right?

51
00:04:02,856 --> 00:04:06,451
- Oh, yeah. I got it.
- Who are you?

52
00:04:06,526 --> 00:04:09,393
- I'm John Grogan?
- No, you're John friggin' Grogan...

53
00:04:09,462 --> 00:04:11,430
who's about to get
a job as a reporter...

54
00:04:11,498 --> 00:04:14,956
for a major metropolitan newspaper.

55
00:04:15,035 --> 00:04:18,027
- Mmm. Mmm.
- Good. Good. But now I don't feel
like getting out of the car.

56
00:04:18,104 --> 00:04:20,299
- You have to. No, baby.
- Maybe we'll just drive around the block.

57
00:04:20,373 --> 00:04:22,739
Come on, get out of the car. Get out.

58
00:04:24,744 --> 00:04:27,975
- Now, who am I again?
- Oh, please.

59
00:04:28,048 --> 00:04:31,176
<i>Sebastian says you won
some kind of award.</i>

60
00:04:31,251 --> 00:04:34,186
Mitchie. I have a Mitchie.

61
00:04:34,254 --> 00:04:37,155
It's like a Pulitzer,
but from western Michigan.

62
00:04:37,223 --> 00:04:39,885
A Mitchie.

63
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,485
So, tell me-What made you
leave the estimable...

64
00:04:42,562 --> 00:04:45,122
Kalamazoo Gazette?

65
00:04:45,198 --> 00:04:48,531
Well, as you know, Sebastian
and I were in college together...

66
00:04:48,602 --> 00:04:51,469
And he w- He was-

67
00:04:51,538 --> 00:04:54,006
He was always saying
how great south Florida is...

68
00:04:54,074 --> 00:04:58,511
and that maybe my wife and I might enjoy it
here, so we decided to come down here.

69
00:04:58,578 --> 00:05:01,206
- Are you a comedian too?
- Excuse me?

70
00:05:01,281 --> 00:05:03,715
Like your friend over here.

71
00:05:03,783 --> 00:05:07,048
- No.
- He's walking a very thin line.

72
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,281
It's a good thing he knows how to write.

73
00:05:09,356 --> 00:05:11,950
So your wife is Jenny Havens?

74
00:05:12,025 --> 00:05:15,791
Yes. Jenny Grogan-
'Cause we're married. She took my name.

75
00:05:15,862 --> 00:05:18,956
- She get the job at the <i>Post?</i>
- Yes, she did.

76
00:05:19,032 --> 00:05:22,001
- Why didn't they want you over there?
<i>- Well, I didn't apply.</i>

77
00:05:22,068 --> 00:05:24,002
<i>Jenny's more of a feature writer...</i>

78
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:26,004
and I'm more of
a straight news writer.

79
00:05:26,072 --> 00:05:28,563
- I thought this would be a better fit for that.
- You think you're better...

80
00:05:28,642 --> 00:05:32,544
than the six journalism school graduates
that came here looking for work this morning?

81
00:05:32,612 --> 00:05:34,546
I don't know if I'm better. I-

82
00:05:34,614 --> 00:05:37,674
What I do know is that I have
a tendency to surprise myself.

83
00:05:37,751 --> 00:05:41,278
Ten years ago I was doing bong hits
and playing Donkey Kong.

84
00:05:41,354 --> 00:05:44,016
I never dreamed
I'd get into college, but I did...

85
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:46,888
<i>and I graduated with honors.</i>

86
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,690
And I never thought I'd get a job
at a real newspaper, but I did.

87
00:05:49,763 --> 00:05:51,731
<i>And I certainly never thought</i>
<i>I'd get a girl...</i>

88
00:05:51,798 --> 00:05:54,323
<i>like Jenny Havens</i>
<i>to marry me, but I did.</i>

89
00:05:58,138 --> 00:06:01,437
- So?
- They've already got a guy on the metro desk.

90
00:06:01,508 --> 00:06:03,442
Yeah.

91
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:05,944
- I'm sorry, honey.
- Mmm. So they're putting me on a little thing...

92
00:06:06,012 --> 00:06:08,742
they like to call Desert Storm.

93
00:06:08,815 --> 00:06:10,908
- You got the job?
- I got the job.

94
00:06:10,984 --> 00:06:13,282
You got the job, baby! Ooh!

95
00:06:13,353 --> 00:06:15,184
<i>John Grogan, I knew it!

96
00:06:15,255 --> 00:06:17,689
I just knew it! Okay, Look.

97
00:06:17,757 --> 00:06:19,918
Watch this. Look.
See what happens?

98
00:06:19,993 --> 00:06:21,927
"Job. Done."

99
00:06:21,995 --> 00:06:24,463
- Okay, so what's next? Lunch?
- House.

100
00:06:24,531 --> 00:06:25,964
- House.
- House.

101
00:06:45,719 --> 00:06:48,483
<i>... planes that can</i>
<i>transmit remote television pictures...</i>

102
00:06:48,555 --> 00:06:51,023
<i>of Iraqi ships and other targets.</i>

103
00:06:51,091 --> 00:06:54,583
Did- Did you get to the quote
about the speed bumps yet?

104
00:06:54,661 --> 00:06:58,028
- "'If they save even one life"'-
- "'... it would be worth it.'

105
00:06:58,098 --> 00:07:01,431
And with that, Jan Dickerson's eyes
filled with tears."

106
00:07:01,501 --> 00:07:03,435
- Filled with tears.
- You like that?

107
00:07:03,503 --> 00:07:05,437
- Or is it too corny?
- Yeah. No.

108
00:07:05,505 --> 00:07:08,565
Is it a little over the top?

109
00:07:08,641 --> 00:07:11,439
Hey, honey, what happened
to the, uh- the Desert Storm piece?

110
00:07:11,511 --> 00:07:15,277
- That's it. The injured girl's dad's in Kuwait.
<i>- Oh.</i>

111
00:07:15,348 --> 00:07:17,282
- Is that not in there?
- Uh-

112
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:19,978
Uh-uh. I think they cut that.

113
00:07:20,053 --> 00:07:22,487
They-They spelled your name wrong.

114
00:07:22,555 --> 00:07:26,150
- "John Gorgon."
- You're kidding. Let me see that.

115
00:07:26,226 --> 00:07:27,488
- Forget it.
- Are you joking?

116
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,585
Forget it. You know what?
It's good. It's really good.

117
00:07:29,662 --> 00:07:31,823
It's got the facts.
It's got color.

118
00:07:31,898 --> 00:07:33,991
- It's a really solid piece.
- Thanks.

119
00:07:34,067 --> 00:07:37,730
Well, I mean, I tried to breathe
some life into it, you know-

120
00:07:37,804 --> 00:07:41,672
- Yes.
- I like this article. I'm almost done with yours.

121
00:07:41,741 --> 00:07:44,608
This idea of voting machines
sounds really efficient.

122
00:07:44,677 --> 00:07:46,702
Well, when you get
to the next page, you'll see...

123
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:50,682
- that I talk about what <i>could</i> happen.
- Hey, it- Oh, okay. I see.

124
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:53,514
- It continues.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

125
00:07:55,522 --> 00:07:57,456
But actually, the rest of it...

126
00:07:57,524 --> 00:07:59,458
is really just okay.

127
00:07:59,526 --> 00:08:01,756
- It's actually kind of boring.
- No, no. I- It's-

128
00:08:01,828 --> 00:08:03,819
- I'm enjoying this.
- Mmm.

129
00:08:05,098 --> 00:08:08,829
Wow. They really gave you
a lot of space.

130
00:08:11,738 --> 00:08:14,730
Oh, damn. Killed another one.

131
00:08:14,808 --> 00:08:19,040
How am I ever supposed to take care of
a kid if I can't even keep a plant alive?

132
00:08:19,112 --> 00:08:21,706
Well, what'd you expect, man?

133
00:08:21,781 --> 00:08:24,443
You bought a house-
A house with a spare room.

134
00:08:24,517 --> 00:08:26,451
What's the matter with a spare room?

135
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:29,545
It's empty, John, that's what's wrong
with it. You know what else is empty?

136
00:08:29,622 --> 00:08:31,556
Her womb.

137
00:08:31,624 --> 00:08:33,854
- I'm just worried that Jenny's at, like, step seven.
- What?

138
00:08:33,927 --> 00:08:36,725
She's got her whole life
organized and planned out...

139
00:08:36,796 --> 00:08:38,821
- according to these steps.
- Okay, that's scary.

140
00:08:38,898 --> 00:08:42,766
Unbelievable.
You want my advice? Get her, like, a bird.

141
00:08:42,836 --> 00:08:44,770
Or a puppy or something.

142
00:08:44,838 --> 00:08:48,069
- A parakeet or something?
- Something other than you
that she has to take care of.

143
00:08:48,141 --> 00:08:50,871
You got a kid, you're a dad.
You're not you anymore.

144
00:08:50,944 --> 00:08:53,936
- You got a dog, you're a-
- Master.

145
00:08:54,013 --> 00:08:55,947
- You're still a guy.
- Still got a life.

146
00:08:56,015 --> 00:08:58,142
- Exactly.
- And a dog.

147
00:08:58,218 --> 00:09:00,709
Yeah, but you've stopped
her clock for a few years.

148
00:09:00,787 --> 00:09:03,449
- I've never had a dog.
- There's nothin' to it. You feed 'em.

149
00:09:03,523 --> 00:09:05,548
You walk 'em. You let 'em out
every now and again.

150
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:09,083
But it doesn't really matter. You're not
the one that's gonna take care of it, Jenny is.

151
00:09:09,162 --> 00:09:10,891
<i>- Sebastian!</i>
- Yo.

152
00:09:10,964 --> 00:09:13,023
Your travel's been approved.
Hit the road.

153
00:09:13,099 --> 00:09:15,727
- Where you goin'?
<i>- I'm going to Colombia.</i>

154
00:09:15,802 --> 00:09:20,171
I got a guy down there says he can
put me next to Pablo Escobar.

155
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,174
I'm doin' a piece-

156
00:09:22,242 --> 00:09:25,803
I follow a single coca leaf from
the jungle to the streets of Miami.

157
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:28,746
That sounds like a good idea.
You gotta be careful down there-

158
00:09:28,815 --> 00:09:31,784
- Gorman!
- G-Grogan.

159
00:09:31,851 --> 00:09:34,615
Groden. There's a fire
in the county dump-

160
00:09:34,687 --> 00:09:36,985
<i>- Methane leak.</i>
- Methane?

161
00:09:37,056 --> 00:09:39,149
Yeah. I want two paragraphs
for the Blotter.

162
00:09:41,794 --> 00:09:45,560
Methane. Woodward
and Bernstein, eat your heart out.

163
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,760
What kind of dog?

164
00:09:49,836 --> 00:09:52,498
- You remember Caroline?
- The nurse?

165
00:09:52,572 --> 00:09:54,699
She was a nursery school teacher.
I don't know.

166
00:09:54,774 --> 00:09:58,266
Anyway, she had
this great dog- Daisy.

167
00:09:58,344 --> 00:10:00,335
It was a Labradoodle.

168
00:10:00,413 --> 00:10:03,780
Labradoodle? You mean a Labrador.

169
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:05,977
All right. Get her a Labrador.

170
00:10:06,052 --> 00:10:08,680
<i>Supposed to be just like kids,</i>
<i>only easier to train.</i>

171
00:10:09,889 --> 00:10:12,915
Labradoodle? Come on.

172
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,434
This does not smell like an I HOP.

173
00:10:22,502 --> 00:10:24,970
I know. We got a little surprise first.

174
00:10:25,038 --> 00:10:29,236
- Here we go. Now, I want you
to walk right here, my dear.
- Okay.

175
00:10:29,309 --> 00:10:31,539
- Come on.
- Oh, God.

176
00:10:31,611 --> 00:10:33,545
Okay.

177
00:10:33,613 --> 00:10:35,604
- You Grogan?
- Yes.

178
00:10:35,682 --> 00:10:37,946
- Expected you an hour ago.
- You're gonna like this.

179
00:10:38,017 --> 00:10:40,212
<i>Okay, step up. Sorry.</i>

180
00:10:40,286 --> 00:10:42,220
Sorry about the mess-

181
00:10:42,288 --> 00:10:46,054
- And the noise and the smell.
- What's happening?

182
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:48,525
Come on.

183
00:10:48,594 --> 00:10:50,528
- Can I look?
- No, no. Just-Almost. Almost.

184
00:10:50,596 --> 00:10:52,587
- Okay. Okay. Ready?
- Really?

185
00:10:52,665 --> 00:10:56,499
One, two, three. Go.
Happy birthday.

186
00:10:56,569 --> 00:10:58,560
<i>What?</i>

187
00:10:58,638 --> 00:11:00,572
God, they're adorable.

188
00:11:02,241 --> 00:11:04,573
Oh, my- My birthday's
not for a month.

189
00:11:04,644 --> 00:11:07,204
<i> That's okay. They can't leave</i>
<i>for three weeks anyway.</i>

190
00:11:09,282 --> 00:11:13,048
- We didn't discuss this.
- I know, but it's a surprise. You can't.

191
00:11:13,119 --> 00:11:15,952
<i>- Hi, guys.</i>
- Just adopted the mom last month.

192
00:11:16,022 --> 00:11:19,355
Family that gave her up didn't
even know she was pregnant.

193
00:11:19,425 --> 00:11:22,826
- Are you sure we're ready for this?
<i>- Well, like I told you...</i>

194
00:11:22,895 --> 00:11:25,420
you gotta wait three weeks for them to
be weaned before you can bring 'em home.

195
00:11:25,498 --> 00:11:27,227
- I'm not even gonna be here.
- Why?

196
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:30,098
- I'll be in Gainesville, covering that trial.
- Oh, that's right.

197
00:11:30,169 --> 00:11:32,137
That's okay. It'll give me
a chance to bond with him...

198
00:11:32,205 --> 00:11:33,934
- and get a head start on training 'em-
- That's true.

199
00:11:34,007 --> 00:11:37,340
- Get 'em squared away before you get home.
- That's true.

200
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:39,776
- Well, how are we gonna pick one?
<i>- Girls are 300.</i>

201
00:11:39,846 --> 00:11:42,747
Boys are 275.

202
00:11:42,815 --> 00:11:47,013
Except for that little guy there.
Him you could have for 200 even.

203
00:11:47,086 --> 00:11:51,284
This one? You're so sweet.
You're like a little clearance puppy.

204
00:11:51,357 --> 00:11:53,757
- Hello, puppy.
- This one likes you.

205
00:11:53,826 --> 00:11:56,192
Clearance Puppy likes you.

206
00:11:56,262 --> 00:11:59,425
- Well, that's your guy.
<i>- Aw.</i>

207
00:11:59,499 --> 00:12:01,433
I was gonna pick you anyway.

208
00:12:01,501 --> 00:12:03,765
Don't tell anybody.
Don't tell the others.

209
00:12:07,073 --> 00:12:11,339
<i>- We gotta double-time it just a little here, honey.</i>

210
00:12:11,411 --> 00:12:13,641
- Really wish I didn't have to go.
- Are you kidding me?

211
00:12:13,713 --> 00:12:15,977
It's gonna be great.
You spent eight months on this trial.

212
00:12:16,049 --> 00:12:17,983
- Honestly, I'm jealous.
- Really?

213
00:12:18,051 --> 00:12:19,985
Tax evasion? That's what
makes you jealous?

214
00:12:20,053 --> 00:12:22,112
Well, it's sexier than speed bumps.

215
00:12:22,188 --> 00:12:24,622
- Okay, you call me the minute you get him home.
- Okay. Okay.

216
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:28,217
- We also have to come up with a name for him.
- Yes. Let's brainstorm it.

217
00:12:28,294 --> 00:12:30,819
I'll just call him Clearance Puppy
till you get back.

218
00:12:30,897 --> 00:12:33,695
- Are you gonna be okay?
- You're worried about me with a puppy?

219
00:12:33,766 --> 00:12:34,994
<i>- I am.</i>
- Me, John friggin' Grogan?

220
00:12:35,068 --> 00:12:37,400
- I know.
- Good-bye. I love you. You look pretty.

221
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:39,131
- Thank you. I love you. Bye.
- Okay. Bye.

222
00:12:44,911 --> 00:12:47,209
How ya doin' there, buddy?

223
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,840
Kind of a big day for you.

224
00:12:50,917 --> 00:12:53,613
Let's listen to the radio.

225
00:12:53,686 --> 00:12:56,120
Awkward silences.

226
00:12:56,189 --> 00:13:00,023
- One love
- You like that? You like Bob Marley?

227
00:13:00,093 --> 00:13:04,154
<i>- Let's get together and</i>
- Bob. That be a good name?

228
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:08,166
<i>- Feel all right</i>
- Bob. Bob. Come here, Bob. Or Robert?

229
00:13:08,234 --> 00:13:10,498
When you got older.
More dignified.

230
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:12,697
- <i>The children cryin'</i>
- Marley?

231
00:13:12,772 --> 00:13:14,763
<i>- Sayin' give thanks and praise</i>
- You like that.

232
00:13:14,841 --> 00:13:16,536
That has a nice ring to it.

233
00:13:16,609 --> 00:13:18,804
<i>- Feel all right</i>
- Okay. Whoa.

234
00:13:18,878 --> 00:13:21,142
It's better if you ride shotgun.

235
00:13:21,214 --> 00:13:24,308
- Because we don't wanna have a car crash-
<i>- And feel all right</i>

236
00:13:24,383 --> 00:13:26,715
our first real day together.

237
00:13:26,786 --> 00:13:29,220
<i>Let them all pass all their</i>

238
00:13:29,288 --> 00:13:31,222
<i>Dirty remarks</i>

239
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:34,282
- Okay, come here. Come here.
- <i>There is one question</i>

240
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,158
It's a big day. You can ride over here.

241
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:39,664
Maybe it's okay today.
<i>Just this one time.</i>

242
00:13:42,602 --> 00:13:44,900
<i>We get pulled over, we explain-</i>

243
00:13:44,971 --> 00:13:47,872
We explain what
the circumstances are.

244
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:50,170
<i>To save his own beliefs</i>

245
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:53,244
<i>One love-</i>

246
00:13:55,615 --> 00:13:58,482
- What happened?
- The Millers got robbed.

247
00:13:58,551 --> 00:14:01,918
Again? Good thing I got a watchdog.

248
00:14:01,988 --> 00:14:04,149
Hey, buddy. He's got some teeth.

249
00:14:04,223 --> 00:14:06,157
Oh, yeah.

250
00:14:06,225 --> 00:14:08,159
I'll get him some water.

251
00:14:08,227 --> 00:14:10,388
You're not gonna keep him
in the backyard, are you?

252
00:14:10,463 --> 00:14:13,364
I'm gonna keep him in the garage
till I get him house trained.

253
00:14:13,432 --> 00:14:17,232
- Hmm.
- No, Marley, Marley, Marley. No, no.

254
00:14:18,571 --> 00:14:20,436
No, no, no, no.

255
00:14:20,506 --> 00:14:23,498
<i>You've had enough food, Marley.</i>
<i>You've had two bowls of kibble.</i>

256
00:14:23,576 --> 00:14:27,307
You had half a seat belt in the car.

257
00:14:28,881 --> 00:14:33,341
Huh. H-How are you still eating?

258
00:14:36,489 --> 00:14:39,458
<i>I don't understand where</i>
<i>you can put it.</i>

259
00:14:39,525 --> 00:14:44,019
Here's the little box where
Marley's gonna bunk down.

260
00:14:44,096 --> 00:14:46,030
Pretty cozy.

261
00:14:46,098 --> 00:14:49,465
All right. Good night.

262
00:14:51,671 --> 00:14:53,764
You're gonna be okay.

263
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,807
I'm just right inside.

264
00:14:56,809 --> 00:14:58,743
Sleep tight.

265
00:15:26,672 --> 00:15:29,106
<i>All right.</i>

266
00:15:30,876 --> 00:15:32,810
Come on, Marley.

267
00:15:32,878 --> 00:15:35,210
You're killin' me, you know that?

268
00:15:50,997 --> 00:15:54,956
Oh, we got some cleanin' up
to do before the missus gets back.

269
00:15:56,669 --> 00:15:57,465
All right.

270
00:15:57,536 --> 00:15:59,561
I'm off to the airport...

271
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:03,200
and you're gonna ride out
the rain right in your little box.

272
00:16:05,845 --> 00:16:09,372
It's just a little thunder.
Back in a flash.

273
00:16:35,675 --> 00:16:38,235
<i>- Get in. Here.</i>
- Oh, my God!

274
00:16:38,311 --> 00:16:41,542
- Oh!
- Aaah.

275
00:16:41,614 --> 00:16:43,673
- Hi.
- How are you?

276
00:16:43,749 --> 00:16:45,683
- How's my puppy?
- I'm okay.

277
00:16:45,751 --> 00:16:48,845
A little tired, but trying to stay dry.

278
00:16:48,921 --> 00:16:51,754
- No, really. How is he?
- Waiting for you.

279
00:17:05,071 --> 00:17:09,007
Do you hear that?
Is that- I think that's Marley.

280
00:17:16,682 --> 00:17:18,547
Oh, my God.

281
00:17:18,617 --> 00:17:20,517
Oh, my God. Look at this!

282
00:17:20,586 --> 00:17:23,180
This is not how I left it.

283
00:17:23,255 --> 00:17:25,348
<i>- How long did you leave him?</i>
<i>- I left him for maybe an hour.</i>

284
00:17:25,424 --> 00:17:27,517
Tops. Did he eat the drywall?

285
00:17:29,028 --> 00:17:31,121
- Oh, that's not right.
- Wow.

286
00:17:31,197 --> 00:17:33,358
That's one little dog did that.

287
00:17:33,432 --> 00:17:36,094
Oh, honey, you're shaking.

288
00:17:36,168 --> 00:17:39,535
Does thunder scare you, mister?

289
00:17:39,605 --> 00:17:42,369
<i>Oh, ho. Sweet boy.</i>

290
00:17:42,441 --> 00:17:44,773
Oh, look at us.

291
00:17:46,946 --> 00:17:50,438
So I'm in this cave and-
and I can feel the machine guns.

292
00:17:50,516 --> 00:17:52,416
There's, like, nine of them around me.

293
00:17:52,485 --> 00:17:55,079
- What, like AK-47 s?
<i>- Kalashnikov.</i>

294
00:17:55,154 --> 00:17:57,384
- And then Escobar comes in and says-
- Escobar?

295
00:17:57,456 --> 00:18:02,052
El Padrino-Yeah. He says,
"I read your piece on Gadhafi...

296
00:18:02,128 --> 00:18:05,325
and I think you captured
his narcissism perfectly."

297
00:18:06,399 --> 00:18:09,061
<i>- Can you believe that?</i>
- Some of it.

298
00:18:09,135 --> 00:18:11,000
Man, I wish you
could have been there.

299
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:14,767
But then who's gonna cover the power
struggle down at the Rotary Club in Delray?

300
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,240
Oh, it's been just crazy.

301
00:18:17,309 --> 00:18:21,006
- Your time will come, amigo.
- I'll drink to that.

302
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,981
That was crazy. Oh, my God.

303
00:18:24,049 --> 00:18:26,643
- Oh, my God!
- That is the cutest thing I've ever seen.

304
00:18:26,719 --> 00:18:28,744
<i>- Hey.</i>
<i>- Say hello, Marley.</i>

305
00:18:28,821 --> 00:18:30,311
- Hey, little Marley.
- Can I hold him?

306
00:18:30,389 --> 00:18:31,822
Of course. Here you go.

307
00:18:31,891 --> 00:18:33,984
<i>- He's so cute.</i>
- Oh, I love their puppy breath.

308
00:18:34,059 --> 00:18:38,189
Oh. Have you guys met my buddy Sebastian?

309
00:18:38,264 --> 00:18:40,425
Sebastian. Viviana.
Nice to meet you.

310
00:18:40,499 --> 00:18:42,990
- Hi. I'm Shannon.
- Hey, he's a beauty, isn't he?

311
00:18:43,068 --> 00:18:47,164
<i>- He's adorable.</i>
- I think the "puppy instead
of a baby" idea is working.

312
00:18:47,239 --> 00:18:50,436
- Yeah, it's certainly working for me.
- Can I take him home with me?

313
00:18:50,509 --> 00:18:52,340
You're so cute. Yes, you are.

314
00:18:52,411 --> 00:18:56,006
I can't let you have the puppy, but
you might have a shot with the big dog.

315
00:18:56,081 --> 00:18:58,049
- I'm easy.
- Oh, you're easy.

316
00:18:58,117 --> 00:19:00,017
<i>And I do tricks.</i>
<i>I'm paper trained.</i>

317
00:19:04,256 --> 00:19:06,281
Marley! Marley!

318
00:19:06,358 --> 00:19:09,327
<i>- Come back, puppy.</i>
- Marley! Marley!

319
00:19:16,569 --> 00:19:18,537
Marley!

320
00:19:18,604 --> 00:19:21,129
Marley. Marley!

321
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:30,373
- Marley!
- Puppy!

322
00:19:37,756 --> 00:19:39,986
- Got him. Thanks.
- You have got to be more careful, man.

323
00:19:40,059 --> 00:19:43,927
It's our first week together,
so we're still working out the kinks.

324
00:19:43,996 --> 00:19:47,090
You really shouldn't bring a dog
down to the dog beach until he's trained.

325
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:48,929
Okay, can I get the dog back?

326
00:19:49,001 --> 00:19:51,731
Never let him off leash
unless you have complete confidence.

327
00:19:51,804 --> 00:19:53,635
- Okay.
- This is the only beach in two counties...

328
00:19:53,706 --> 00:19:55,537
- where dogs aren't banned.
- All right.

329
00:19:55,608 --> 00:19:58,668
Cops see anybody peeing or pooping
down by the water, they'll shut us down.

330
00:19:58,744 --> 00:20:02,111
Why is that funny to you?

331
00:20:03,182 --> 00:20:05,446
I'm just very immature.

332
00:20:05,518 --> 00:20:07,611
Calvin!

333
00:20:09,922 --> 00:20:12,015
See? Aren't you glad
you're not Calvin?

334
00:20:12,091 --> 00:20:14,457
See how easy you got it?

335
00:20:17,663 --> 00:20:19,631
<i>Marley, stop!</i>

336
00:20:19,698 --> 00:20:22,132
<i>Marley. Marley.</i>

337
00:20:22,201 --> 00:20:24,726
Honey, the dog's got my-

338
00:20:24,803 --> 00:20:27,533
<i>Marley, no.</i>

339
00:20:27,606 --> 00:20:29,597
Marley, you can't go
through a screen door.

340
00:20:33,345 --> 00:20:36,178
<i>We're rockin' the suburbs</i>

341
00:20:36,248 --> 00:20:39,081
<i>Around the block</i>
<i>just one more time</i>

342
00:20:39,151 --> 00:20:41,483
<i>We're rockin' the suburbs</i>

343
00:20:41,554 --> 00:20:44,318
- <i>We part the shades and face some facts</i>
- Happy Thanksgiving.

344
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:45,721
- You too.
- <i>They got better looking fescue</i>

345
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:48,385
Marley!

346
00:20:49,628 --> 00:20:52,119
It just seems like
that there's other guys.

347
00:20:52,197 --> 00:20:55,564
- Like, I don't understand why you thought of me.
- I'm in a bind.

348
00:20:55,634 --> 00:20:57,465
Yeah, but I'm a reporter.
I'm not a columnist.

349
00:20:57,536 --> 00:20:59,766
<i>John, you get better pay...

350
00:20:59,838 --> 00:21:02,898
you can pick your own hours
and choose your own topics.

351
00:21:02,975 --> 00:21:05,739
<i>- Why are you hesitating?</i>
- No, I'm thinking.

352
00:21:05,811 --> 00:21:09,338
No, you're hesitating. I'm offering you
a promotion, and you're hesitating.

353
00:21:09,415 --> 00:21:10,973
I never saw myself as a columnist.

354
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:14,349
Well, think of it as one of those times
when you surprise yourself.

355
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:17,821
- Okay.
<i>- John, it's only a couple of times a week...</i>

356
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:19,824
till I get a replacement for Jerry.

357
00:21:19,892 --> 00:21:22,588
Then you can go back to doing
whatever the hell it was you were doing.

358
00:21:22,661 --> 00:21:26,495
<i>- What were you doing?</i>
- Obituaries, methane leaks.

359
00:21:26,565 --> 00:21:28,226
- Are you okay with this?
- Yes.

360
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,097
- You don't seem very thrilled.
- No, it's a promotion.

361
00:21:30,169 --> 00:21:34,629
- We could take away the raise in pay if you like.
- No, no. I'm-Thank you.

362
00:21:34,707 --> 00:21:37,107
All right. Now you're talking.
Go on. Get to work.

363
00:21:37,176 --> 00:21:40,668
Oh! Marley. I think
he dislocated my shoulder.

364
00:21:40,746 --> 00:21:43,306
God. He doesn't even heel.

365
00:21:43,382 --> 00:21:46,283
He doesn't walk.
He just sprints.

366
00:21:46,352 --> 00:21:48,820
<i>Marley- God.</i>

367
00:21:48,887 --> 00:21:51,117
<i>Marley, stop.</i>

368
00:21:52,691 --> 00:21:54,852
<i>I had to pull him</i>
<i>off three dogs today.</i>

369
00:21:54,927 --> 00:21:57,418
- Poodles?
- Among others.

370
00:21:57,496 --> 00:21:59,487
I say we give him away to a farm.

371
00:21:59,565 --> 00:22:03,092
Isn't that usually what you do
with dogs that are out of control?

372
00:22:03,168 --> 00:22:06,604
<i>Well, usually you-</i>
<i>Usually you train them.</i>

373
00:22:06,672 --> 00:22:09,266
Or you train 'em.
Come on. Down. Go on.

374
00:22:09,341 --> 00:22:12,037
What are you doing?

375
00:22:12,111 --> 00:22:14,545
Arnie gave me a column.

376
00:22:14,613 --> 00:22:17,548
Are you kidding?
Baby, that's great.

377
00:22:17,616 --> 00:22:19,550
Oh, yeah. It's a big honor.

378
00:22:19,618 --> 00:22:21,552
I get to write about zoning laws...

379
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:23,588
and give my opinion on yard sales.

380
00:22:23,656 --> 00:22:26,591
Whoa. Down, boy.
Easy with the enthusiasm.

381
00:22:26,659 --> 00:22:30,390
<i>Well, no, it's just, I don't even read</i>
<i>this crap when other people write it.</i>

382
00:22:30,462 --> 00:22:34,899
Now I'm supposed to, you know,
write two columns a week?

383
00:22:34,967 --> 00:22:37,231
<i>And you got nothin' for Tuesday.</i>

384
00:22:37,302 --> 00:22:39,736
No. I got <i>nothin'</i> for Tuesday.

385
00:22:39,805 --> 00:22:41,966
I bet you're gonna
think of something.

386
00:22:43,776 --> 00:22:47,234
Now, see, this gives me a little
inspiration, but it's not for a column.

387
00:22:47,312 --> 00:22:48,370
It's more like-

388
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:51,014
Look at Marley.
Now he's eating the floor.

389
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:53,984
Marley, stop.

390
00:22:54,053 --> 00:22:56,044
Marley, you're incorrigible.

391
00:22:56,121 --> 00:22:58,817
<i>Incorrigible? I don't believe in that word.</i>

392
00:22:58,891 --> 00:23:00,859
Every dog wants to learn.

393
00:23:00,926 --> 00:23:03,087
Hey, come here, baby.

394
00:23:03,162 --> 00:23:05,756
Yes, you're a good girl.
You're a good girl.

395
00:23:05,831 --> 00:23:07,765
Yes, you are.

396
00:23:07,833 --> 00:23:10,427
'Course, they can't learn
if their parents are weak-willed.

397
00:23:10,502 --> 00:23:13,027
Yeah. Well, I'm pretty
strong-willed, but-

398
00:23:13,105 --> 00:23:16,541
- Marley-
- Say hello to Marley.

399
00:23:16,608 --> 00:23:18,974
So which of you is gonna be the trainer?

400
00:23:19,044 --> 00:23:22,411
Well, we both thought we would, 'cause
we'd like him to listen to both of us at home.

401
00:23:22,481 --> 00:23:25,041
- We're married too. Yeah.
- No, no, no, no.

402
00:23:25,117 --> 00:23:27,051
A dog can only have one master.

403
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:30,816
Which one of you has the most natural
authority in your own relationship?

404
00:23:32,357 --> 00:23:34,587
Well, maybe I'll stand
over there for the beginning.

405
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:36,753
I thought so. Shall we?

406
00:23:38,731 --> 00:23:42,167
- Geez!
- All right, sit.

407
00:23:42,234 --> 00:23:44,600
Sit. Sit.

408
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:46,661
<i>- Sit. Marley.</i>

409
00:23:46,739 --> 00:23:49,105
Okay. Marley- Marley, sit.

410
00:23:49,174 --> 00:23:53,110
This, class, is a classic example of a dog...

411
00:23:53,178 --> 00:23:56,147
who has foolishly been
allowed to believe...

412
00:23:56,215 --> 00:23:59,810
<i>he is the alpha male of the pack...</i>

413
00:23:59,885 --> 00:24:02,911
and therefore, he can never be a happy animal.

414
00:24:02,988 --> 00:24:05,422
Yeah. He looks pretty miserable.

415
00:24:05,491 --> 00:24:09,484
You, joker, rotate in.

416
00:24:09,561 --> 00:24:11,825
<i>And lose the sunglasses.</i>

417
00:24:11,897 --> 00:24:13,922
Dog likes to be
looked at in the eye.

418
00:24:13,999 --> 00:24:16,559
<i>- Jawohl.</i>
- I got it.

419
00:24:16,635 --> 00:24:17,863
- Okay.
- Okay. You got him?

420
00:24:17,936 --> 00:24:18,868
- Yeah.
- Okay.

421
00:24:18,937 --> 00:24:21,201
So. Collar your dogs.

422
00:24:22,875 --> 00:24:25,139
<i>Good boy.</i>

423
00:24:26,411 --> 00:24:28,845
<i>All right, dogs on the left.</i>

424
00:24:28,914 --> 00:24:31,212
<i>On the count of three.</i>

425
00:24:31,283 --> 00:24:34,309
One, two, three. Let's go.

426
00:24:36,188 --> 00:24:38,952
Very nice. Very good.

427
00:24:40,759 --> 00:24:42,852
Good.

428
00:24:42,928 --> 00:24:44,862
- Hey!
<i>- Correct him!</i>

429
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:46,955
- Whoa!
- Rein in that dog.

430
00:24:47,032 --> 00:24:49,125
All right. All right, class.

431
00:24:49,201 --> 00:24:51,135
Come on. Let's line up again.

432
00:24:51,203 --> 00:24:54,639
Class, it's a simple question
of having confidence...

433
00:24:54,706 --> 00:24:56,833
in your own authority.

434
00:24:56,909 --> 00:24:59,878
I shall now demonstrate a simple walk.

435
00:24:59,945 --> 00:25:02,038
All right?

436
00:25:02,114 --> 00:25:04,048
Mr. Grogan?

437
00:25:04,116 --> 00:25:06,141
- Sorry.
- May I?

438
00:25:06,218 --> 00:25:08,652
<i>All right, even an unruly dog...</i>

439
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,245
likes to obey his leader.

440
00:25:11,323 --> 00:25:14,724
Marley, heel.

441
00:25:17,296 --> 00:25:18,763
Yeah.

442
00:25:18,831 --> 00:25:21,061
Marley. Marley!

443
00:25:21,133 --> 00:25:24,933
Marley! Marley!

444
00:25:26,471 --> 00:25:29,065
Marley.

445
00:25:34,446 --> 00:25:36,744
<i>Careful. Marley, no!</i>

446
00:25:36,815 --> 00:25:38,840
<i>- Marley!</i>

447
00:25:43,789 --> 00:25:46,883
Aaah! That's it. He is out.

448
00:25:46,959 --> 00:25:49,018
Sorry. Usually he does this with poodles.

449
00:25:49,094 --> 00:25:52,086
That dog is a bad influence on the others.

450
00:25:53,165 --> 00:25:55,793
<i>Now, leg humping is like a virus.</i>

451
00:25:55,868 --> 00:25:58,860
Once it takes hold of the group- No.

452
00:25:58,937 --> 00:26:01,405
<i>- Okay.</i>
- He has got to go.

453
00:26:01,473 --> 00:26:04,601
It was maybe your hair.

454
00:26:04,676 --> 00:26:08,009
- Reminded him of a poodle.
- Never bring him back.

455
00:26:09,514 --> 00:26:12,210
<i>Right from the beginning</i>
<i>she had me in her sights.</i>

456
00:26:12,284 --> 00:26:14,980
- I know. She really did.
- Marley wouldn't take any of her crap.

457
00:26:15,053 --> 00:26:17,180
That's why he got kicked out.

458
00:26:17,256 --> 00:26:20,419
You are now the world's worst dog.

459
00:26:20,492 --> 00:26:22,653
You've been kicked out
of obedience school.

460
00:26:22,728 --> 00:26:25,663
You know, there is
something else that we could do.

461
00:26:25,731 --> 00:26:28,393
No, I know. We just-We get a-

462
00:26:30,469 --> 00:26:35,497
No. No, no, no, no, no.
I'm smiling, but I'm serious. No.

463
00:26:37,075 --> 00:26:39,509
It's not gonna be so bad, buddy.

464
00:26:39,578 --> 00:26:42,069
You'll see. Sex is overrated.

465
00:26:43,348 --> 00:26:47,341
Aw, I can't tell you that,
'cause you know it's a lie.

466
00:26:47,419 --> 00:26:49,649
Poor son of a bitch.

467
00:26:49,721 --> 00:26:53,157
Okay. You wanna come up?
Yeah. That's the least I can do.

468
00:26:53,225 --> 00:26:55,455
- Marley!
<i>- Get a little fresh air.</i>

469
00:26:55,527 --> 00:26:59,429
Oh, gosh. It's like he's
walking the plank.

470
00:26:59,498 --> 00:27:01,728
I mean, that's what
breaks my heart, is he's so happy.

471
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,030
- He doesn't know what's coming.
- Honey, he's gonna be fine.

472
00:27:05,671 --> 00:27:08,162
- Oh, no, no, no. That makes me nervous.
- He's okay.

473
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,037
He's just getting a little air.

474
00:27:14,513 --> 00:27:17,038
It's like <i>Of Mice and Men.</i>

475
00:27:17,115 --> 00:27:19,675
- No, Marley-
- Oh, John, please-

476
00:27:21,219 --> 00:27:23,380
- Oh, my God.
- He's makin' a break for it.

477
00:27:23,455 --> 00:27:26,117
He's onto our evil plan.

478
00:27:26,191 --> 00:27:29,058
- Pull over.
- I can't stop here. I can't.

479
00:27:29,127 --> 00:27:32,494
- Honey, pull over.
- I'm trying to. There's a ton of traffic.

480
00:27:35,734 --> 00:27:38,635
- Pull over!
- All right, all right. All right.

481
00:27:40,372 --> 00:27:44,001
- Jesus.
- I need a little help here.

482
00:27:44,076 --> 00:27:45,634
Hey, get a leash.

483
00:27:45,711 --> 00:27:49,670
<i>- Shut up.</i>
- He's losing his balls today. Cut him some slack.

484
00:27:49,748 --> 00:27:51,773
You got him? Careful. Careful.

485
00:27:58,256 --> 00:28:01,225
This is a rough draft, 'cause I'd like
to take another pass at it.

486
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:07,825
You know, the beginning,
I think I might want-

487
00:28:07,899 --> 00:28:10,595
I think we can maybe lose that,
'cause I think it gets a little bit "jokey."

488
00:28:13,605 --> 00:28:16,438
I just reread it, and I didn't think
it really worked at all. I'm sorry.

489
00:28:16,508 --> 00:28:18,908
- I'm gonna go back and do the zoning piece.
- Wait. Wait a minute.

490
00:28:18,977 --> 00:28:21,104
What are you apologizing for?
This stuff is hysterical.

491
00:28:21,179 --> 00:28:24,376
- Really?
<i>- I'm laughing my head off at this.</i>

492
00:28:24,449 --> 00:28:26,940
The-The getting kicked out
of obedience school...

493
00:28:27,019 --> 00:28:28,953
the humping, the great escape-

494
00:28:29,021 --> 00:28:31,683
That's really funny stuff.
I'm laughing my ass off.

495
00:28:31,757 --> 00:28:33,691
<i>It's hysterical stuff.</i>

496
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:35,590
Run it- the way it is.

497
00:28:37,529 --> 00:28:39,724
Thanks.

498
00:28:39,798 --> 00:28:42,892
Listen. You know what makes it work?

499
00:28:42,968 --> 00:28:46,404
What makes it work is that
you put yourself into it. I like that.

500
00:28:46,471 --> 00:28:49,304
- Good.
<i>- Look, I know you're a reporter and all...</i>

501
00:28:49,374 --> 00:28:51,604
but could you do
a few more things like this?

502
00:28:51,676 --> 00:28:53,109
- Sure.
<i>- Great.</i>

503
00:28:53,178 --> 00:28:56,739
- Okay, great.
- And tell your dog not to feel too bad.

504
00:28:56,815 --> 00:28:59,875
Sooner or later,
we all lose our balls.

505
00:28:59,951 --> 00:29:01,919
Hey, good to know.

506
00:29:23,909 --> 00:29:25,604

568
00:32:14,312 --> 00:32:16,177
<i>Nada.</i>

569
00:32:19,184 --> 00:32:21,152
Why don't you just
let him off the leash?

570
00:32:21,219 --> 00:32:24,416
Because although I love him,
I don't trust him.

571
00:32:24,489 --> 00:32:26,423
<i>Honey, it's been two years.</i>
<i>He's never had an accident.</i>

572
00:32:26,491 --> 00:32:28,425
I know, 'cause I never
let him off the leash.

573
00:32:28,493 --> 00:32:31,724
We're not gonna be the guys who get
Dog Beach shut down, are we, Marley?

574
00:32:31,796 --> 00:32:33,923
Nope.

575
00:32:33,999 --> 00:32:37,435
Okay. So what's next?

576
00:32:37,502 --> 00:32:39,663
Um, ice cream?

577
00:32:39,738 --> 00:32:41,672
No. I mean on your list.

578
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:43,401
- My list?
- Jen, the list-

579
00:32:43,475 --> 00:32:46,501
Your little play list that you had when
we got married that had the game plan.

580
00:32:46,578 --> 00:32:48,876
- It was basically my marching orders.
- My plan?

581
00:32:48,947 --> 00:32:52,713
Your plan. I wanna know
what's next. Scare me.

582
00:32:52,784 --> 00:32:55,116
- You really wanna know?
- Hit me.

583
00:32:55,186 --> 00:32:59,953
- Well, it's a toss-up between the new roof-
- Very practical.

584
00:33:01,026 --> 00:33:03,961
And, uh- and a baby.

585
00:33:11,436 --> 00:33:13,700
I could live with a few leaks.

586
00:33:14,906 --> 00:33:17,136
- Really?
- Yeah, a couple.

587
00:33:17,208 --> 00:33:20,006
But you know, a couple leaks
turn into maybe one big leak...

588
00:33:20,078 --> 00:33:23,377
and then that big leak becomes
a very big responsibility.

589
00:33:23,448 --> 00:33:26,645
- That's true.
- We may want to think
about fixing a lot of things...

590
00:33:26,718 --> 00:33:29,118
- before we start-
- Well, honey, we already fixed Marley.

591
00:33:29,187 --> 00:33:32,884
If we fix too many more things, then
I think this conversation becomes moot.

592
00:33:32,957 --> 00:33:35,824
<i>John, are you serious?</i>

593
00:33:35,894 --> 00:33:38,055
Yeah. Yeah, I think so.

594
00:33:38,129 --> 00:33:40,689
- You realize we're not talking
about an actual roof here.
<i>- Yes.</i>

595
00:33:40,765 --> 00:33:43,131
I got that. About halfway
through I picked it up.

596
00:33:43,201 --> 00:33:45,169
Good metaphor though.

597
00:33:45,236 --> 00:33:48,933
And you're not just saying this 'cause
you think it'll lead to some funny columns?

598
00:33:49,007 --> 00:33:51,669
Honey, come on. I mean,
if I get some funny columns...

599
00:33:51,743 --> 00:33:54,405
that's collateral damage
I think we can live with.

600
00:33:54,479 --> 00:33:57,573
I mean, I'm ready... if you are.

601
00:33:57,649 --> 00:33:59,879
Well, instead of trying
to have a baby...

602
00:33:59,951 --> 00:34:04,251
why don't just stop
trying not to have one?

603
00:34:04,322 --> 00:34:07,291
- Okay, if I'm following you
correctly, and I think I am-
- Uh-huh.

604
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:10,692
This is the part-We head back,
we take it off, we get it on.

605
00:34:10,762 --> 00:34:13,322
Yes, but you'll- It'll have a little
more romance than that.

606
00:34:13,398 --> 00:34:17,767
- Yeah, we'll get some candles,
some Sade of course.
- Sade?

607
00:34:23,975 --> 00:34:25,101
- Honey?
- Yeah?

608
00:34:25,176 --> 00:34:27,371
Did you have kibble today?

609
00:34:27,445 --> 00:34:29,811
Marley, come on. Marley, go.

610
00:34:29,881 --> 00:34:31,815
Honey, he's a dog.
He won't know what he's looking at.

611
00:34:31,883 --> 00:34:34,511
No, no, trust me. He knows,
and he resents the hell out of me.

612
00:34:34,586 --> 00:34:37,646
- Go on, Marley. You have to go.
- Oh, baby, please focus. Focus.

613
00:34:37,722 --> 00:34:39,690
- Okay. All right.
- Mm-hmm.

614
00:34:44,329 --> 00:34:47,730
<i>Good. Good.</i> It's even better
than the last one.

615
00:34:47,799 --> 00:34:49,892
- Thank you.
<i>- You're very good, Grogan.</i>

616
00:34:49,968 --> 00:34:52,994
I like that piece you did
in Boca last week on the woman.

617
00:34:53,071 --> 00:34:55,505
<i>- What'd you call her?</i>
- "Boca-hantas."

618
00:34:55,573 --> 00:34:58,633
- Is that true- She had her boobs done four times?
- That's what she said.

619
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:02,043
Hysterical. And is that true
about you and your wife?

620
00:35:02,113 --> 00:35:05,640
- You're trying to have a kid?
- Well, you know, we're not really trying...

621
00:35:05,717 --> 00:35:07,685
- 'cause we don't wanna-
<i>- How does that work?</i>

622
00:35:07,752 --> 00:35:10,220
- What do you mean?
- Well, I mean, you having sex?

623
00:35:10,288 --> 00:35:12,483
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- Did you pull the goalie?

624
00:35:12,557 --> 00:35:14,286
- Yeah.
<i>- Then you're trying.</i>

625
00:35:14,359 --> 00:35:17,157
Congratulations. Good work.

626
00:35:17,228 --> 00:35:19,423
"Not trying" trying?

627
00:35:19,497 --> 00:35:22,432
Oh, yeah. 'Course, you'd know that
if you ever read my column.

628
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:25,663
Hey, all due respect, but does
anybody ever read your column?

629
00:35:25,737 --> 00:35:28,365
Come on. I bring Marley out here
to help you run your game...

630
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:31,273
on these poor girls,
and this is the thanks we get.

631
00:35:31,342 --> 00:35:34,607
- How long you been at it?
- A few months.

632
00:35:34,679 --> 00:35:37,341
- What changed your mind?
- Well, here's the thing.

633
00:35:37,415 --> 00:35:39,713
I'm actually married to someone...

634
00:35:39,784 --> 00:35:42,344
and I care about what she wants.

635
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:44,354
Well, is it what <i>you</i> want?

636
00:35:44,422 --> 00:35:46,185
Yeah.

637
00:35:46,257 --> 00:35:50,284
- I guess that answers my other question.
- Yeah?

638
00:35:50,361 --> 00:35:52,295
I'm about to do a piece
on the growth...

639
00:35:52,363 --> 00:35:54,729
of the domestic drug trade
for the <i>Times</i> magazine.

640
00:35:54,799 --> 00:35:57,495
- You're freelancing for the <i>New York Times?</i>
- Yeah.

641
00:35:57,569 --> 00:35:59,833
Yeah, but it's a big story.

642
00:35:59,904 --> 00:36:03,169
Too big for one guy and, uh, I was
hoping you'd write it with me.

643
00:36:04,809 --> 00:36:06,800
Are you kidding me?

644
00:36:06,878 --> 00:36:10,041
- Be a chance for us to work together.
- Yeah, I would love that.

645
00:36:10,114 --> 00:36:12,810
Of course, it will be
a lot of work, a lot of travel.

646
00:36:12,884 --> 00:36:15,250
I would hope so.

647
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:18,517
Maybe not the best job for, uh,
somebody with a kid on the way.

648
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:22,993
Well, that's not necessarily
happening right this very second.

649
00:36:23,061 --> 00:36:25,962
Let me talk it-There she is.

650
00:36:27,432 --> 00:36:29,900
- Honey, how are you?
- Hi.

651
00:36:29,968 --> 00:36:33,870
I'm just calling to let you know that
there's a naked woman in your bed.

652
00:36:33,938 --> 00:36:37,601
Why don't the two of you get started,
and I'll be there as soon as I can?

653
00:36:37,675 --> 00:36:40,439
Oh, very funny.

654
00:36:40,512 --> 00:36:42,537
But seriously,
can you come home now?

655
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:49,244
Hey. We're home.

656
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:52,312
<i>Hi.</i>

657
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:56,520
You know the baby thing? I've been
thinking, maybe we should take a break.

658
00:36:58,363 --> 00:37:03,562
You know? Obviously it's not working,
and maybe it's nature's way...

659
00:37:03,635 --> 00:37:05,933
of saying now's
not the right timing.

660
00:37:07,505 --> 00:37:12,101
I mean, maybe it's a sign that we're
not quite ready for this, that-

661
00:37:12,176 --> 00:37:14,041
- I mean, have we really thought this-
- John.

662
00:37:15,046 --> 00:37:17,412
I'm pregnant.

663
00:37:18,516 --> 00:37:20,450
- Great.
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>

664
00:37:20,518 --> 00:37:24,079
Wow. Great. Really?

665
00:37:24,155 --> 00:37:25,213
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- Yes.

666
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:27,224
You were-You were just saying-

667
00:37:27,292 --> 00:37:29,317
No, don't worry.
That was, like-

668
00:37:29,394 --> 00:37:31,453
It sounds so awkward now,
like I just have this, like...

669
00:37:31,529 --> 00:37:35,556
very, you know, idiotic
soliloquy that doesn't apply...

670
00:37:35,633 --> 00:37:37,624
and I'm really excited.

671
00:37:37,702 --> 00:37:39,761
<i>- Do you want to start over?</i>
- I would love to.

672
00:37:39,837 --> 00:37:41,270
<i>- That would be great. Can we?</i>
- By all means.

673
00:37:41,339 --> 00:37:44,172
Good.

674
00:37:45,843 --> 00:37:49,939
- I'm pregnant.
- What? No!

675
00:37:50,014 --> 00:37:52,244
Yes!

676
00:37:52,317 --> 00:37:54,842
<i>Listen. Don't make</i>
<i>the same mistake I did.</i>

677
00:37:54,919 --> 00:37:57,683
- What?
- There's gonna come a time very soon...

678
00:37:57,755 --> 00:38:01,384
- where her ankles are gonna swell up.
- No, I'm ready for that.

679
00:38:01,459 --> 00:38:03,723
- She's gonna have blotches all over her face.
- Yeah.

680
00:38:03,795 --> 00:38:05,729
She'll be 40 pounds overweight.

681
00:38:05,797 --> 00:38:08,322
- She'll be throwing up all the time.
- I'm not ready for <i>that.</i>

682
00:38:08,399 --> 00:38:10,333
She's gonna look at you
and she's gonna say...

683
00:38:10,401 --> 00:38:12,767
"You bastard. You did this to me."

684
00:38:12,837 --> 00:38:15,704
What-What happened to the glow?
The-You know, the-

685
00:38:15,773 --> 00:38:18,298
There's no glow. Get her a gift.

686
00:38:18,376 --> 00:38:20,708
That'll dissipate some of the anger.

687
00:38:20,778 --> 00:38:22,769
Uh, earrings, uh, bracelet-

688
00:38:22,847 --> 00:38:24,781
That's thoughtful.
It's a good idea.

689
00:38:24,849 --> 00:38:28,012
- Maybe I'll get on it right now.
- There's a jewelry store on the corner.

690
00:38:28,086 --> 00:38:29,314
- All right.
- Mention my name.

691
00:38:31,923 --> 00:38:34,016
Oh, John.

692
00:38:34,092 --> 00:38:36,856
It's just beautiful.

693
00:38:36,928 --> 00:38:39,795
It's just... beautiful.

694
00:38:39,864 --> 00:38:41,798
Honey, thank you.

695
00:38:41,866 --> 00:38:43,993
You're welcome. I was just
walking by this-Thinking of you-

696
00:38:44,068 --> 00:38:46,036
- Yeah?
- And I saw that in the window and I go...

697
00:38:46,104 --> 00:38:48,800
- "I'm getting this."
- That's so sweet.

698
00:38:48,873 --> 00:38:51,637
- Yeah, well- Do you like it?
- I love it.

699
00:38:51,709 --> 00:38:54,769
Yeah, well, put it on. Or let me put it on.
I think it's better luck.

700
00:38:54,846 --> 00:38:56,541
- Where'd it go?
- What'd you do with it?

701
00:38:56,614 --> 00:38:58,377
- You just set it down, I thought.
- I just had it.

702
00:38:58,449 --> 00:39:00,007
- Did you drop it?
- No, I put it right here.

703
00:39:00,084 --> 00:39:02,211
It didn't just disappear.

704
00:39:02,286 --> 00:39:04,220
Oh, God.

705
00:39:06,791 --> 00:39:09,487
- Marley. No- Marley, spit it out.
- No, no.

706
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,824
Go to the kitchen. Go to the kitchen.

707
00:39:11,896 --> 00:39:13,830
<i>Marley, I have a treat.</i>

708
00:39:13,898 --> 00:39:16,492
Come here.

709
00:39:16,567 --> 00:39:19,400
<i>Stay. Marley, stay.</i>

710
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:22,837
<i>Good boy. Yeah.</i>

711
00:39:25,309 --> 00:39:29,405
Marley!

712
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:34,775
Marley!

713
00:39:34,852 --> 00:39:37,116
<i>Come here, Marley.</i>

714
00:39:38,756 --> 00:39:40,951
Geez.

715
00:39:44,262 --> 00:39:46,662
- Marley, drop it.
- Marley.

716
00:39:46,731 --> 00:39:50,189
- Marley.
- Is it there? Oh, honey, I don't see it.

717
00:39:53,137 --> 00:39:56,436
Marley, you gotta
lay off the mangoes.

718
00:39:57,675 --> 00:40:00,166
You know, years ago,
when I imagined my life...

719
00:40:00,244 --> 00:40:02,735
somehow standing in the backyard...

720
00:40:02,814 --> 00:40:06,648
<i>hosing down your crap, looking</i>
<i>for my wife's swallowed, recycled...</i>

721
00:40:06,718 --> 00:40:09,949
ass-kissing gift
never jumped to mind.

722
00:40:10,021 --> 00:40:11,955
Which shows you gotta dream big...

723
00:40:12,023 --> 00:40:14,116
<i>'cause- Oh. Jackpot.</i>

724
00:40:14,392 --> 00:40:19,125
My, that's a lovely necklace. So shiny.

725
00:40:19,197 --> 00:40:23,463
- Yes, it is.
- And how's that crazy dog of yours?

726
00:40:23,534 --> 00:40:25,832
I read your columns every week.

727
00:40:25,903 --> 00:40:27,928
- Oh.
- Oh. So you're the one.

728
00:40:28,005 --> 00:40:31,634
I think you'll get a kick out of next week's column.

729
00:40:31,709 --> 00:40:34,439
The heartbeat'll be very fast-
Like a little train. That's normal.

730
00:40:34,512 --> 00:40:36,639
Is it- Is it too early
to tell the sex?

731
00:40:36,714 --> 00:40:38,511
I- Not that I care.

732
00:40:38,583 --> 00:40:42,110
Can be male, female-
Whatever sex he wants.

733
00:40:42,186 --> 00:40:44,586
<i>- Unambiguous genitalia...</i>

734
00:40:44,655 --> 00:40:47,453
- if I had my druthers, but-
- Shh. Hang on.

735
00:40:50,495 --> 00:40:52,725
Sometimes you can't hear it, depending
on how the baby's lying.

736
00:40:52,797 --> 00:40:55,163
- You're 10 weeks, right?
- Monday I'll be 10 weeks.

737
00:40:55,233 --> 00:40:58,600
Hmm. Well, might be
a little too early for that.

738
00:40:58,669 --> 00:41:01,331
Let's go right to the sonogram.
Did you bring your blank tape?

739
00:41:01,405 --> 00:41:03,930
- Oh, yes.
- Yes. Yes.

740
00:41:04,008 --> 00:41:06,442
- That's warm.
- Mm-hmm.

741
00:41:06,511 --> 00:41:08,945
- Let's get a good picture for you first, huh?
- Okay.

742
00:41:09,013 --> 00:41:12,107
It'll be right up
on the monitor here.

743
00:41:19,056 --> 00:41:21,490
Excuse me. I'll be just a minute.

744
00:41:32,436 --> 00:41:34,370
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

745
00:41:34,438 --> 00:41:37,635
Let's take a look
at your baby, shall we?

746
00:41:39,677 --> 00:41:41,645
All right.

747
00:41:48,519 --> 00:41:50,487
Is there anything in there?

748
00:41:53,724 --> 00:41:56,318
Not what you would expect
to see at 10 weeks.

749
00:41:56,394 --> 00:41:58,385
I'm not- I'm not quite 10 weeks.

750
00:41:58,462 --> 00:42:01,761
At Monday it's still,
I guess, nine weeks.

751
00:42:01,833 --> 00:42:04,563
Nine weeks.

752
00:42:04,635 --> 00:42:07,126
There's no heartbeat, Jen.

753
00:42:09,407 --> 00:42:12,137
I'm very, very sorry.

754
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:14,940
These things-They happen sometimes.
We don't know why.

755
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:18,014
<i>You're young. You have your health.</i>

756
00:42:18,082 --> 00:42:20,812
<i>Couple months,</i>
<i>you guys can try again.</i>

757
00:42:20,885 --> 00:42:23,786
I'm sorry. All right, I'm gonna-

758
00:42:23,855 --> 00:42:26,847
<i>I'll leave you guys alone for a moment</i>
<i>and we'll talk some more.</i>

759
00:42:26,924 --> 00:42:29,017
I'm very sorry.

760
00:42:49,847 --> 00:42:52,839
Well, in a couple months
we can try again, okay?

761
00:43:18,209 --> 00:43:20,200
You want some tea?

762
00:43:23,714 --> 00:43:27,309
You know what I was thinking-
That we, uh-

763
00:43:27,385 --> 00:43:29,512
We still have those tickets
from your parents...

764
00:43:29,587 --> 00:43:32,613
for the honeymoon in Ireland.

765
00:43:32,690 --> 00:43:36,592
We could finally do that.
Maybe take some time off.

766
00:43:38,129 --> 00:43:40,222
<i>Jenny?</i>

767
00:44:23,975 --> 00:44:27,536
- Oh, he's... big.
- Oh, yeah. He's a hundred pounds.

768
00:44:27,611 --> 00:44:30,205
- Now, he just wants to say hello here.
- Yeah.

769
00:44:30,281 --> 00:44:32,749
<i>- He loves people.</i>
<i>- Just be calm. You just stay still.</i>

770
00:44:32,817 --> 00:44:34,682
And you're a dog person, right?

771
00:44:34,752 --> 00:44:37,243
- Actually, I'm-
- Ready? Here we go.

772
00:44:37,321 --> 00:44:38,720
Go on, you can say hello.

773
00:44:38,789 --> 00:44:40,814
No, no, don't let him do that.
Sorry. Sorry.

774
00:44:40,891 --> 00:44:42,916
All you have to do is-
You just knee him if he does that.

775
00:44:42,994 --> 00:44:44,586
That shouldn't happen all the time.
<i>Just when you walk through the door.

776
00:44:44,662 --> 00:44:48,029
<i>But here, read this. This'll tell you</i>
<i>everything you need to know.</i>

777
00:44:48,099 --> 00:44:50,158
- I've got the bags here.
- Have you got everything?

778
00:44:50,234 --> 00:44:53,169
- Thank you. Come on, honey.
- Can you get that door?

779
00:44:53,237 --> 00:44:55,432
- I got it.
<i>- Okay. Here we are.</i>

780
00:44:55,506 --> 00:44:57,201
<i>- Honey, we're really late.</i>
- Oh! Marley. Marley.

781
00:44:57,274 --> 00:44:59,868
<i>Debby, welcome to our home.</i>

782
00:44:59,944 --> 00:45:03,107
<i>Marley is a spirited dog</i>
<i>who loves interaction.</i>

783
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:05,876
<i>We've never left him before,</i>
<i>but we are sure he'll behave...</i>

784
00:45:05,950 --> 00:45:07,884
<i>just as he does when we're at home.</i>

785
00:45:11,288 --> 00:45:14,121
<i>There are just a few things about</i>
<i>Marley you're gonna need to know.</i>

786
00:45:14,191 --> 00:45:16,557
<i>- He eats three times a day.</i>

787
00:45:17,828 --> 00:45:20,262
<i>If he looks starved, feed him again.</i>

788
00:45:21,999 --> 00:45:24,866
<i>Now, of course, all of this food</i>
<i>is gonna have to go somewhere...</i>

789
00:45:24,935 --> 00:45:28,871
<i>so use the blue pooper scooper,</i>
<i>and watch your step.</i>

790
00:45:28,939 --> 00:45:31,737
<i>Don't worry about the color.</i>
<i>He likes mangoes.</i>

791
00:45:31,809 --> 00:45:34,039
<i>Marley is not allowed</i>
<i>to drink out of the toilet...</i>

792
00:45:34,111 --> 00:45:36,545
<i>so be sure to keep the lid closed...</i>

793
00:45:36,614 --> 00:45:38,548
<i>- and the brick on the lid.</i>

794
00:45:38,616 --> 00:45:40,550
<i>You know, actually,</i>
<i>you might want...</i>

795
00:45:40,618 --> 00:45:42,552
<i>to just keep the bathroom door</i>
<i>shut in general.</i>

796
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:45,282
<i>Like most dogs, Marley</i>
<i>needs a lot of exercise...</i>

797
00:45:45,356 --> 00:45:50,293
<i>so try to take him for a walk or a run</i>
<i>every morning and every evening.</i>

798
00:45:50,361 --> 00:45:52,659
Marley, let go!

799
00:45:52,730 --> 00:45:55,130
Let go. Let go. Let go.
Aaah! Marley, no!

800
00:45:55,199 --> 00:45:58,566
<i>And be sure to lock the doors</i>
<i>and windows before you go to sleep.</i>

801
00:45:58,636 --> 00:46:00,001
Shoo! Shoo!

802
00:46:00,071 --> 00:46:02,562
<i>But don't worry.</i>
<i>Marley is an excellent watchdog.</i>

803
00:46:04,642 --> 00:46:07,634
<i>You can rest easy at night</i>
<i>knowing he's on the job.</i>

804
00:46:07,711 --> 00:46:09,975
<i>Thunderstorms are his weak point.</i>

805
00:46:10,047 --> 00:46:12,675
<i>You can give him sedatives</i>
<i>if you think a storm is arriving.</i>

806
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:16,277
Okay. Here you go. Marley.
Marley, come back here.

807
00:46:16,353 --> 00:46:19,789
<i>He doesn't like them, so push them</i>
<i>down his throat as far as they go.</i>

808
00:46:19,857 --> 00:46:23,088
Welcome. Welcome.
I'm Mrs. Butterly.

809
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:27,620
<i>Now finally, we do not allow Marley</i>
<i>to get up on any piece of furniture...</i>

810
00:46:27,698 --> 00:46:29,825
<i>chew on anything except his toys.</i>

811
00:46:31,535 --> 00:46:35,301
<i>Other than that, enjoy him.</i>
<i>Love, Jenny and John.</i>

812
00:46:35,506 --> 00:46:40,102
We serve tea every day at 4:00,
and dinner at 6:00 sharp.

813
00:46:40,177 --> 00:46:44,307
<i>Oh, and these blankets are woolen.</i>
<i>Good heat in 'em.</i>

814
00:46:44,381 --> 00:46:47,441
- So-So they're electric?
- Oh, not in this house.

815
00:46:47,518 --> 00:46:51,181
My brother died in a fire,
God rest his soul.

816
00:46:51,255 --> 00:46:54,952
In this room, actually.

817
00:46:55,025 --> 00:46:57,721
<i>Oh, not to worry.</i>
<i>It's been re-papered.</i>

818
00:46:57,795 --> 00:47:00,229
Well, good night to ya both.

819
00:47:00,297 --> 00:47:02,231
- And God bless you.
- God bless.

820
00:47:02,299 --> 00:47:04,631
Thank you. You- Bless you.

821
00:47:08,472 --> 00:47:11,305
That was just weird.

822
00:47:15,079 --> 00:47:16,740
<i>Oh, gosh.</i>

823
00:47:16,814 --> 00:47:21,114
Honey, I- I know that we
haven't had sex since-You know.

824
00:47:21,185 --> 00:47:25,053
But I don't think we're breaking
that streak tonight.

825
00:47:25,122 --> 00:47:27,056
No, no. I don't-

826
00:47:27,124 --> 00:47:29,058
I don't want to break
the streak here.

827
00:47:29,126 --> 00:47:31,754
<i>This doesn't feel-</i>
<i>I mean, I think I could...</i>

828
00:47:31,829 --> 00:47:36,198
you know, handle God watching,
and his mother, but-

829
00:47:36,267 --> 00:47:40,260
But not- not this little
porcelain pontiff right here.

830
00:47:40,337 --> 00:47:43,738
It's July, and I think I can see my breath.

831
00:47:43,807 --> 00:47:46,708
- Honey, I can't feel my toes.
<i>- That's not good.</i>

832
00:47:46,777 --> 00:47:49,337
I wanna check on that.

833
00:47:51,415 --> 00:47:53,747
Oh, good God, shush.

834
00:47:53,817 --> 00:47:58,447
It's not the bed. It's the shrieks
of oversexed souls in hell.

835
00:48:01,692 --> 00:48:03,819
Don't you want to join them?

836
00:48:05,729 --> 00:48:07,663
Really?

837
00:48:07,731 --> 00:48:09,926
Mm-hmm.

838
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,991
We don't have to.

839
00:48:12,069 --> 00:48:16,267
I know, but the idea that it hasn't
happened here in 50 years is just-

840
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:18,968
It's kind of turning me on.

841
00:48:23,347 --> 00:48:25,713
Honey, I missed you.

842
00:48:51,976 --> 00:48:53,910
Marley! Hi, honey.

843
00:48:53,978 --> 00:48:55,912
- Marley.
- Ohh.

844
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:57,914
Come here.

845
00:48:57,982 --> 00:48:59,347
<i>- We missed you so much.</i>
<i>- Hey, Debby.</i>

846
00:48:59,416 --> 00:49:01,850
There were 11 thunderstorms
while you were gone.

847
00:49:01,919 --> 00:49:05,685
<i>Eleven. And you were right.</i>
<i>He doesn't like thunderstorms.</i>

848
00:49:05,756 --> 00:49:08,418
Wow. Okay. Yeah. Eleven.
That's a lot of thunderstorms.

849
00:49:08,492 --> 00:49:11,359
Oh, and just so you know, I am
a dog person, but that's not a dog.

850
00:49:11,428 --> 00:49:15,694
That is evil with a dog face that is
humping my leg and peeing on your carpet.

851
00:49:15,766 --> 00:49:19,133
- Marley.
- Marley, stop that.

852
00:49:25,743 --> 00:49:29,179
Marley, come on.
It's just thunder. No barking.

853
00:49:33,284 --> 00:49:36,447
Marley, come on.
It's just thunder.

854
00:49:38,222 --> 00:49:40,190
Marley, come on.

855
00:49:40,257 --> 00:49:41,519
Jenny?

856
00:49:41,592 --> 00:49:44,527
Can you help me out here?

857
00:49:44,595 --> 00:49:48,292
I got 20 minutes
to file this column, and I gotta-

858
00:49:48,365 --> 00:49:50,697
<i>Jenny?</i>

859
00:49:50,768 --> 00:49:53,896
- Ah, the luck of the Irish.
- What?

860
00:50:44,355 --> 00:50:46,289
Mmm.

861
00:50:59,002 --> 00:51:01,027
Whoa.

862
00:51:01,105 --> 00:51:04,734
Wow. Whoo.

863
00:51:04,808 --> 00:51:07,242
Aah. Ooh. Oh, God.

864
00:51:07,311 --> 00:51:09,939
<i>John? Honey. John.</i>
<i>John, wake up.</i>

865
00:51:10,013 --> 00:51:11,947
- Yeah?
- It's time.

866
00:51:12,015 --> 00:51:14,745
...comfortable.

867
00:51:14,818 --> 00:51:16,752
Okay, but- Ooh.

868
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:18,947
- God!
- You all right? You all right?

869
00:51:19,022 --> 00:51:20,011
You okay?

870
00:51:20,090 --> 00:51:21,614
No, it's okay. I'm not gonna hurt her.

871
00:51:21,692 --> 00:51:23,751
Try not to scream,
'cause I don't want him to kill me.

872
00:51:23,827 --> 00:51:25,954
You remembered to install
the car seat this weekend?

873
00:51:26,029 --> 00:51:28,589
- They won't let us take the baby home-
- Right. I wouldn't forget that.

874
00:51:28,665 --> 00:51:30,758
- I know that. I'm sorry.
- You got that?

875
00:51:30,834 --> 00:51:31,926
I got it. I got it.

876
00:51:35,639 --> 00:51:38,301
Yeah, come on, Marley.
Help me out here.

877
00:51:38,375 --> 00:51:43,005
You can chew through drywall, Marley.
This is nothing for you.

878
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:45,674
Good. Yeah.

879
00:51:47,885 --> 00:51:49,819
You're gonna stay here.

880
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:51,878
This bone will keep you busy now.

881
00:51:51,955 --> 00:51:55,254
Hopefully, no thunderstorms.
And I'm off like-

882
00:52:17,114 --> 00:52:19,309
Who's your daddy? Come here.

883
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:31,594
Here's the thing.

884
00:52:31,662 --> 00:52:34,688
In about two minutes
we're gonna bring home the baby...

885
00:52:34,765 --> 00:52:38,826
and you'd be doing me a really
big favor if you didn't freak out.

886
00:52:40,404 --> 00:52:42,736
And I'm gonna try to do the same.

887
00:52:47,010 --> 00:52:49,911
- Are you ready?
- I'm ready. Yes.

888
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:51,914
<i>Hi. Come here.</i>

889
00:52:51,982 --> 00:52:54,041
Hi, baby. Oh, hi. Hi, sweetie.

890
00:52:54,117 --> 00:52:57,484
Hi, Marley. Oh, come on.

891
00:52:57,554 --> 00:52:59,988
Come here. Okay.

892
00:53:00,057 --> 00:53:04,357
- Marley.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. It would
be a bummer if you ate the baby.

893
00:53:05,996 --> 00:53:08,726
- Mmm. Mmm.
- Shh.

894
00:53:08,799 --> 00:53:12,929
- Just, uh-
- Marley, this is Patrick.

895
00:53:14,671 --> 00:53:17,196
Not to be confused with a chew toy.

896
00:53:17,274 --> 00:53:19,242
Although it may look like one.

897
00:53:19,309 --> 00:53:21,834
Say hi. See, honey?
He's not eating the baby.

898
00:53:22,334 --> 00:53:22,859
Very good.

899
00:53:34,913 --> 00:53:36,211
<i>Yeah.
No, I have a quote for it right here.</i>

900
00:53:36,882 --> 00:53:40,147
Well, have Legal call them again
and get a release for it.

901
00:53:40,219 --> 00:53:42,449
They told me it was on the record.

902
00:53:42,521 --> 00:53:45,490
I don't- Patrick?
Honey, be careful with those toys.

903
00:53:45,558 --> 00:53:48,083
You know Marley gets-
No, Carla, I'm not talking to you.

904
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:50,492
Will you just call them
and get a release?

905
00:53:50,563 --> 00:53:52,497
I-I- I'll call you right back.
Call you right back.

906
00:54:12,885 --> 00:54:15,820
Those days are over for us, amigo.

907
00:54:15,888 --> 00:54:18,152
We had a good run though.

908
00:54:43,549 --> 00:54:44,846
Come on, Marley.

909
00:54:45,751 --> 00:54:47,480
<i>I know this is gonna sound crazy...</i>

910
00:54:47,553 --> 00:54:50,750
but what's that thing called
when you owe money on a house?

911
00:54:50,823 --> 00:54:52,757
- It starts with an "M."
- Mortgage.

912
00:54:52,825 --> 00:54:54,759
Mortgage.

913
00:54:54,827 --> 00:54:57,625
Wow. Is it possible
to be this tired?

914
00:54:57,696 --> 00:55:00,665
You know what?
I'm gonna get up with him tonight.

915
00:55:00,733 --> 00:55:04,032
No, you won't.
You don't hear him.

916
00:55:04,103 --> 00:55:07,800
- Yeah. You're right.
- I don't know... why.

917
00:55:07,873 --> 00:55:10,000
I'm just a blessedly sound sleeper.

918
00:55:10,075 --> 00:55:12,305
Honey, I do have to go
into the office tomorrow though.

919
00:55:12,378 --> 00:55:14,346
Will you watch him then for me?

920
00:55:14,413 --> 00:55:16,574
It'll be my pleasure.

921
00:55:16,649 --> 00:55:21,052
- How long are we talking about?
- I don't know.

922
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:23,884
It's not quite what
you expected, huh?

923
00:55:23,956 --> 00:55:26,254
I don't know what I expected.

924
00:55:26,325 --> 00:55:29,726
- I never thought Marley
would seem like the easy one.
- I know.

925
00:55:29,795 --> 00:55:31,729
I know, but you know what?

926
00:55:31,797 --> 00:55:36,234
We adjusted to him,
and we'll adjust to the baby.

927
00:55:36,301 --> 00:55:40,032
I'm just trying
to remember us from before.

928
00:55:40,105 --> 00:55:42,539
You mean those, uh-
Those younger-

929
00:55:42,608 --> 00:55:45,941
- Yeah.
- Sexier, better-looking people?

930
00:55:46,011 --> 00:55:48,639
- Yeah.
- I remember them. I remember them vaguely.

931
00:55:48,714 --> 00:55:50,705
I miss them.

932
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:52,717
Mmm. They're here.

933
00:55:52,785 --> 00:55:54,878
They're here. They're just really tired.

934
00:55:54,953 --> 00:55:57,285
Mmm?

935
00:55:57,356 --> 00:56:01,622
What? Now you're jealous?

936
00:56:05,431 --> 00:56:08,264
Stay here.

937
00:56:08,333 --> 00:56:10,267
- Call the police.
- Okay.

938
00:56:21,714 --> 00:56:24,649
Hey, hey, hey. Are you all right?
What happened?

939
00:56:24,717 --> 00:56:28,710
He told me not to scream
or he'd stab me, but I screamed.

940
00:56:28,787 --> 00:56:31,017
- But I screamed-
- Okay, now, just sit down. Just sit down.

941
00:56:31,090 --> 00:56:34,150
- And he stabbed me.
- It's all right. That's okay. Hold on.

942
00:56:34,226 --> 00:56:36,217
- Where's your mother?
- At work.

943
00:56:36,295 --> 00:56:38,286
It's okay. It's not that bad.

944
00:56:38,363 --> 00:56:40,558
Keep your hand placed right here.

945
00:56:40,632 --> 00:56:43,795
Okay. Now, I called the police.

946
00:56:43,869 --> 00:56:47,168
Everything's gonna be okay.

947
00:56:47,239 --> 00:56:50,072
You know, in all the time I've lived here,
I've never gotten your name.

948
00:56:50,142 --> 00:56:52,736
- Lisa.
- Okay-

949
00:56:52,811 --> 00:56:54,745
I'm gonna sit right here, Lisa.

950
00:56:54,813 --> 00:56:57,145
You're gonna keep
your hands placed there...

951
00:56:57,216 --> 00:57:00,310
and we're gonna wait
for the police to get here.

952
00:57:00,385 --> 00:57:02,376
And they're gonna take care of this.

953
00:57:02,454 --> 00:57:05,150
All right? Okay?

954
00:57:05,224 --> 00:57:07,692
Look at me. It's all right.

955
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:09,159
It's all right.

956
00:57:09,361 --> 00:57:10,828
<i> Safest neighborhood?</i>

957
00:57:10,896 --> 00:57:13,763
- In terms of crime, I'd say you're lookin' at Boca.
- Boca?

958
00:57:13,832 --> 00:57:16,130
- Mmm.
- I was afraid you were gonna say that.

959
00:57:16,201 --> 00:57:19,762
<i>- That's the way it is, John.</i>
- Okay. Thanks.

960
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:23,374
<i>Boca. Not so bad.</i>

961
00:57:23,442 --> 00:57:25,433
<i>You got kids playin' in the street.</i>
<i>I don't know.</i>

962
00:57:25,511 --> 00:57:29,140
What do you guys think? We might
live here one day... if we can afford it.

963
00:57:29,214 --> 00:57:31,148
<i>Here we go.</i>

964
00:57:31,216 --> 00:57:33,582
I got you right there.

965
00:57:35,721 --> 00:57:38,485
Stay. Marley, no.

966
00:57:38,557 --> 00:57:40,752
Marley. Marley.

967
00:57:40,826 --> 00:57:44,421
<i> And don't you love this kitchen?</i>
<i>And look at the state-of-the-art appliances.</i>

968
00:57:44,496 --> 00:57:47,465
<i>My favorite part- the pool. It's-</i>

969
00:57:50,402 --> 00:57:53,565
<i>- Um, why don't we look over here?</i>
- Can I get a brochure?

970
00:57:53,639 --> 00:57:56,073
- Uh, sure.
- Looks nice.

971
00:57:57,910 --> 00:57:59,901
Whose dog is that?

972
00:58:02,614 --> 00:58:04,605
<i>Jenny?

973
00:58:06,852 --> 00:58:08,843
Honey?

974
00:58:08,921 --> 00:58:10,980
<i>Jen?</i>

975
00:58:13,058 --> 00:58:16,824
<i>- Hey, you okay?</i>
- Mm-hmm. Yeah. No, I'm good.
Where have you guys been?

976
00:58:16,895 --> 00:58:18,829
- I wanna show you something.
- What?

977
00:58:18,897 --> 00:58:22,526
It's a house. Now, it's a little pricey...

978
00:58:22,601 --> 00:58:24,899
<i>but I think we can do it.</i>

979
00:58:24,970 --> 00:58:26,904
- Boca?
<i>- I know, I know.</i>

980
00:58:26,972 --> 00:58:30,100
But I talked to Frank Bennett on the Metro
desk and he says it's the safest neighborhood.

981
00:58:30,175 --> 00:58:32,439
<i>John, I'm just not sure now
is the right time.

982
00:58:32,511 --> 00:58:36,003
<i>Jen, when do you think is the right time,</i>
<i>after one of us gets stabbed in the driveway?</i>

983
00:58:36,081 --> 00:58:38,845
<i>- John.</i>
- Honey, it's cramped in here.

984
00:58:38,917 --> 00:58:41,112
Remember, this was supposed
to be a three-year house.

985
00:58:41,186 --> 00:58:45,179
I know. I know that. I just don't think
we can afford to buy a new one.

986
00:58:45,257 --> 00:58:48,693
- I know, but, honey, we can.
With both our salaries-
- Honey, I'm pregnant.

987
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:50,523
Really?

988
00:58:52,030 --> 00:58:56,023
- Are you sure?
- Come here.

989
00:59:04,176 --> 00:59:06,610
Pretty sure.

990
00:59:06,678 --> 00:59:08,873
Four for four. Wow.

991
00:59:08,947 --> 00:59:10,881
- Hold on.
- That's great.

992
00:59:10,949 --> 00:59:12,883
- Mm-hmm.
- Congratulations.

993
00:59:12,951 --> 00:59:14,885
<i>- Uh-huh. Come here.</i>
- I mean, to both of us.

994
00:59:14,953 --> 00:59:17,046
Oh.

995
00:59:17,122 --> 00:59:19,386
Oh, yes. Oh, you're such a good boy.

996
00:59:19,458 --> 00:59:21,824
Another baby.

997
00:59:21,894 --> 00:59:26,331
I know. Honey, I think
I have to quit my job.

998
00:59:26,398 --> 00:59:28,491
You don't have to do that.
We can get some help.

999
00:59:28,567 --> 00:59:31,263
<i>I don't want any help.</i>
<i>I really don't.</i>

1000
00:59:31,336 --> 00:59:33,270
I just don't-Will you hand me
that pacifier?

1001
00:59:33,338 --> 00:59:36,501
- Yeah.
- I just- I don't want to be one of those people...

1002
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:40,011
that sees their child
for an hour at night.

1003
00:59:40,078 --> 00:59:42,603
<i>- I don't.</i>
- I know, but you love your work and-

1004
00:59:42,681 --> 00:59:44,911
I love my work, honey.
But this is killing me.

1005
00:59:44,983 --> 00:59:48,680
<i>When I'm at the office,</i>
<i>I just wanna be here.</i>

1006
00:59:48,754 --> 00:59:52,087
And when I'm here,
I am constantly thinking about work.

1007
00:59:52,157 --> 00:59:54,990
And I just know that
I'm doing both jobs half- halfway.

1008
00:59:55,060 --> 00:59:57,290
Well, you're not doing them halfway.

1009
00:59:57,362 --> 00:59:59,421
<i>If I have to give up something...</i>

1010
00:59:59,498 --> 01:00:02,763
I do not- I do not
want to give up this.

1011
01:00:02,834 --> 01:00:05,632
<i> Why should I give you a raise?</i>
<i>Give me one good reason.</i>

1012
01:00:05,704 --> 01:00:08,104
'Cause I'm doing a good job.

1013
01:00:08,173 --> 01:00:10,164
- Is that a question?
- No.

1014
01:00:10,242 --> 01:00:12,710
Since I took over the column,
the readership's doubled.

1015
01:00:12,778 --> 01:00:14,837
So you are doing a good job.

1016
01:00:14,913 --> 01:00:18,440
- Yes, if you go by circulation and popularity.
- Okay.

1017
01:00:18,517 --> 01:00:22,715
- Why not make it permanent?
- What do you mean, like forever?

1018
01:00:22,788 --> 01:00:25,552
Yeah, that's what permanent means.

1019
01:00:25,624 --> 01:00:29,219
<i>John, every bozo out there
would like to have their own column.

1020
01:00:29,294 --> 01:00:31,319
Everybody in that entire room.

1021
01:00:31,396 --> 01:00:34,854
And you've taken the column and
you've turned it into something fresh.

1022
01:00:34,933 --> 01:00:38,664
I know you don't want to hear it,
but you're a really good columnist.

1023
01:00:38,737 --> 01:00:41,729
<i>Why you hesitating?</i>

1024
01:00:41,807 --> 01:00:44,833
I just have this idea about myself,
you know, as a reporter.

1025
01:00:44,910 --> 01:00:48,710
Well, sometimes life comes up
with a better idea. I'll tell you what.

1026
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:52,238
You take on a daily column,
I will double your salary.

1027
01:00:57,889 --> 01:01:00,517
<i>I'm so happy</i>

1028
01:01:00,592 --> 01:01:04,995
<i>'Cause today I found my friends</i>

1029
01:01:05,063 --> 01:01:07,463
<i>They're in my head</i>

1030
01:01:07,532 --> 01:01:09,557
<i>I'm so ugly</i>

1031
01:01:09,634 --> 01:01:13,400
<i>That's okay 'cause so are you</i>

1032
01:01:13,472 --> 01:01:15,940
<i>Broke our mirrors</i>

1033
01:01:16,008 --> 01:01:18,033
<i>- Sunday morning</i>

1034
01:01:18,110 --> 01:01:22,604
<i>Is every day for all I care</i>

1035
01:01:22,681 --> 01:01:26,742
<i>And I'm not scared</i>
<i>Light my candles</i>

1036
01:01:26,818 --> 01:01:31,619
<i>In a daze 'cause I found God</i>

1037
01:01:35,660 --> 01:01:39,653
I'll start you off with some corn flakes.
Most important meal-

1038
01:01:39,731 --> 01:01:41,665
No. Marley.

1039
01:01:41,733 --> 01:01:44,031
Most important meal of the day.

1040
01:01:44,102 --> 01:01:46,036
There. Take a little-

1041
01:01:46,104 --> 01:01:50,507
<i>John, please, just take him for a second.
I gotta shower. I gotta go.</i>

1042
01:01:50,575 --> 01:01:55,012
- It happens every time.
- Well, you gotta spend more time with them.

1043
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:58,277
Down! Marley.

1044
01:02:01,486 --> 01:02:04,114
Here we go. Oh, oh, oh.

1045
01:02:04,189 --> 01:02:06,589
- I'll do it. I'll do it.
- No, no, I got it. It's fine.

1046
01:02:06,658 --> 01:02:08,649
You say spend more time
with him, and I do it...

1047
01:02:08,727 --> 01:02:11,321
and then you wanna take over
'cause you say I'm not doing it right.

1048
01:02:11,396 --> 01:02:14,763
- I don't want you changing him when you're mad.
- I'm not mad! I'm-

1049
01:02:14,833 --> 01:02:16,767
Thank you. Come on.

1050
01:02:16,835 --> 01:02:18,928
Hi, baby. Hang on, honey.

1051
01:02:19,004 --> 01:02:22,440
I know, baby. I know. I know.

1052
01:02:22,507 --> 01:02:26,034
Oh, dear. Come on.
Come on. What?

1053
01:02:26,111 --> 01:02:28,602
What's the matter?
What do you need, baby? What is it?

1054
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:32,138
Do you want some food? Food? Yeah?

1055
01:02:32,217 --> 01:02:37,382
- No. Okay.
- He's just colicky, Jen. He'll grow out of it.

1056
01:02:37,456 --> 01:02:42,826
Here's an idea. Why don't you stay home
and I'll go to work while he grows out of it.

1057
01:02:42,894 --> 01:02:45,590
Sorry. I'm tired.
<i>Just go. Just go.</i>

1058
01:02:45,664 --> 01:02:48,895
It's postpartum depression.
Their hormones go on tilt...

1059
01:02:48,967 --> 01:02:50,935
and they get depressed.

1060
01:02:51,002 --> 01:02:54,130
<i>I remember after my fourth kid was born,</i>
<i>I'd wake up in the middle of the night sometimes...</i>

1061
01:02:54,206 --> 01:02:57,607
my wife would be there
staring at me...

1062
01:02:57,676 --> 01:03:00,338
with a meat cleaver in her hand.

1063
01:03:00,412 --> 01:03:03,313
I thought she was gonna kill me.

1064
01:03:03,381 --> 01:03:05,406
I still do.

1065
01:03:05,484 --> 01:03:07,611
Did you get her the gift?

1066
01:03:07,686 --> 01:03:11,486
- Yeah.
<i>- That usually works.</i>

1067
01:03:11,556 --> 01:03:14,184
<i>Okay, Janice, make him look pretty.</i>

1068
01:03:14,259 --> 01:03:17,285
He's gonna have this picture next
to his byline for the next 20 years.

1069
01:03:58,803 --> 01:04:02,170
Patrick, honey, please stop doing that.
You're gonna make him sick.

1070
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:04,333
- Just eat it, okay?
- Careful, Patrick.

1071
01:04:04,409 --> 01:04:07,401
Remember what we did
to Marley when he didn't listen.

1072
01:04:07,479 --> 01:04:10,312
Honey, you know what else?
We really have to pick out a color fabric...

1073
01:04:10,382 --> 01:04:12,646
for the curtains in the boys' room.

1074
01:04:12,717 --> 01:04:17,211
Okay, well, whatever you want. And then-

1075
01:04:17,289 --> 01:04:20,452
I'd really like your help deciding.

1076
01:04:23,762 --> 01:04:26,230
No. Let me get him.

1077
01:04:26,298 --> 01:04:28,289
Thank you.

1078
01:04:35,473 --> 01:04:38,067
Marley, just-

1079
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:42,273
<i>Marley, bad dog!</i>
<i>Marley! Marley, stop it!</i>

1080
01:04:42,347 --> 01:04:45,248
Marley, let go! Let go.

1081
01:04:45,317 --> 01:04:47,376
Marley. Marley.

1082
01:04:47,452 --> 01:04:50,285
Marley! Marley, get back here!
Get back here!

1083
01:04:50,355 --> 01:04:52,585
Marley, bad dog!

1084
01:04:52,657 --> 01:04:55,217
<i>Marley, get back here! Marley!</i>

1085
01:04:55,293 --> 01:04:58,854
See, we were supposed to return these,
and now we have to pay for them.

1086
01:04:58,930 --> 01:05:01,194
- That's okay.
- No, it's not okay!

1087
01:05:01,266 --> 01:05:04,565
How many times have I told you not to
leave anything edible where he can get it?

1088
01:05:04,636 --> 01:05:08,299
- I know, but you wouldn't
exactly say this is edible.
<i>- John, you know what I mean.</i>

1089
01:05:08,373 --> 01:05:12,673
You also said you would get up early and walk
him. He chews things when he gets restless.

1090
01:05:12,744 --> 01:05:15,770
- I am gonna walk him. I just woke up.
- You know what? Forget it!

1091
01:05:15,847 --> 01:05:18,145
- I'm gonna do it myself. Forget it!
- You don't have to.

1092
01:05:18,216 --> 01:05:20,377
<i>Yes, I'm doing it myself.</i>

1093
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:24,880
You don't get it.
She's gonna kill you.

1094
01:05:24,956 --> 01:05:29,791
You've got to take it easy.
We're both hanging by a thread.

1095
01:05:29,861 --> 01:05:33,627
<i>- So who gets the dog if you guys split up?</i>
- We're not splitting up.

1096
01:05:33,698 --> 01:05:36,098
- Out of the realm of possibility?
- Completely.

1097
01:05:36,167 --> 01:05:41,002
There's nothing she can do? No tantrum
too big? No depression too deep?

1098
01:05:41,072 --> 01:05:44,530
No failure to perform wifely duties
that would push you over the edge?

1099
01:05:44,609 --> 01:05:48,841
Why do you jump right to splitting up?
Come on, buddy. Mend it, don't end it.

1100
01:05:48,913 --> 01:05:52,349
- So life is better with Jenny than without her?
- Yes. What is-

1101
01:05:52,417 --> 01:05:55,284
Are you wearing a wire?
<i>Jen, are you- She's listening to this.

1102
01:05:55,353 --> 01:05:58,481
<i>Jenny, yes, we had a fight,
but I still love you.

1103
01:05:58,556 --> 01:06:03,050
Come on, buddy. I had a fight
with my wife. Let me just sulk.

1104
01:06:03,128 --> 01:06:05,528
I just wanna know
if you're really happy.

1105
01:06:05,597 --> 01:06:08,122
Oh, wait. There she is.

1106
01:06:08,199 --> 01:06:10,895
<i>- Who?</i>
- Give me the kid.

1107
01:06:10,969 --> 01:06:13,836
No, I can't be a party to this.
That's-That's shameless.

1108
01:06:13,905 --> 01:06:16,135
This is gonna be
even better than the puppy.

1109
01:06:16,207 --> 01:06:18,300
No, not my son.

1110
01:06:56,348 --> 01:06:58,942
Marley, no. Please, please, Marley.

1111
01:06:59,017 --> 01:07:01,781
<i>- Please.</i>

1112
01:07:17,202 --> 01:07:20,365
Marley! Marley, what are you-

1113
01:07:22,540 --> 01:07:26,203
Marley, God, look at-
Stop it! Why do you do this?

1114
01:07:26,277 --> 01:07:28,802
Why do you ruin everything? Go on!

1115
01:07:30,615 --> 01:07:34,073
Patrick! Are you okay? I'm sorry.

1116
01:07:34,152 --> 01:07:36,882
Get that dog out of here.

1117
01:07:36,955 --> 01:07:39,583
- I want that dog out of here right now.
- I'll take him for a walk.

1118
01:07:39,657 --> 01:07:41,716
I'm not kidding.
No, you take him to that farm.

1119
01:07:41,793 --> 01:07:44,523
<i>All right, buddy, looks like</i>
<i>we're going to the farm again.</i>

1120
01:07:44,596 --> 01:07:47,622
I'm serious. I'm not kidding. I want-
I can't take this anymore.

1121
01:07:47,699 --> 01:07:49,929
- What did he do?
- Everything! What hasn't he done?

1122
01:07:50,001 --> 01:07:52,299
He's just a horrible,
horrible animal.

1123
01:07:52,370 --> 01:07:55,498
- Well, that's a little unfair.
<i>- No, what's unfair...</i>

1124
01:07:55,573 --> 01:07:58,872
is that Conor hasn't slept in two weeks
because of that dog's barking...

1125
01:07:58,943 --> 01:08:01,343
that Patrick gets
knocked down twice a day...

1126
01:08:01,413 --> 01:08:03,347
<i>that I can't even think straight.</i>

1127
01:08:03,415 --> 01:08:05,406
God forbid there's
a hint of thunder.

1128
01:08:05,483 --> 01:08:07,417
- Just don't!
- Just calm down for a second.

1129
01:08:07,485 --> 01:08:10,511
I know that it's been a rough couple of
months with the new baby and everything.

1130
01:08:10,588 --> 01:08:13,785
I understand that.
But I was talking with Arnie.

1131
01:08:13,858 --> 01:08:15,792
- And postpartum dep-
- Don't you dare.

1132
01:08:15,860 --> 01:08:19,694
I am not depressed.
I am exhausted.

1133
01:08:19,764 --> 01:08:22,289
<i>I'm not angry because of some condition.</i>

1134
01:08:22,367 --> 01:08:24,961
I can't even go out
for an hour without the kids...

1135
01:08:25,036 --> 01:08:28,005
because every babysitter in this
neighborhood is terrified of Marley.

1136
01:08:28,072 --> 01:08:31,371
I know that, but you were the one that
said you didn't wanna work anymore.

1137
01:08:31,443 --> 01:08:33,411
<i>- We can get help-</i>
- I don't need any help!

1138
01:08:33,478 --> 01:08:35,412
- That makes it hard.
- Just get rid of the dog!

1139
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:37,675
- That's not gonna happen obviously.
- Please keep your voice down.

1140
01:08:37,749 --> 01:08:40,775
- Me keep my voice down?
- Just do it. Just get rid of the dog!

1141
01:08:40,852 --> 01:08:42,820
Everybody gets rid of their dogs.
It's just a dog.

1142
01:08:42,887 --> 01:08:46,050
And I'm just a husband. You gonna
get rid of me when I misbehave?

1143
01:08:46,124 --> 01:08:48,058
- I've thought about it.
- Well, that makes two of us.

1144
01:08:48,126 --> 01:08:50,526
- What do you have to complain about?
- What do I-

1145
01:08:50,595 --> 01:08:53,621
- Because you're such a joy to be around?
- You're such a jerk.

1146
01:08:53,698 --> 01:08:56,565
So nice to walk in the door,
feel like you're joining a chain gang.

1147
01:08:56,634 --> 01:08:58,124
<i>Just a jerk!</i>

1148
01:09:01,639 --> 01:09:04,904
Stop it! It's your fault.

1149
01:09:04,976 --> 01:09:08,104
- You gotta be kidding me?
- Nope.

1150
01:09:08,179 --> 01:09:11,512
<i>Just for a couple of days
till things cool down at home.</i>

1151
01:09:13,952 --> 01:09:15,920
A couple days will be all right.

1152
01:09:15,987 --> 01:09:18,421
You guys know each other.
You'll be comfortable.

1153
01:09:18,490 --> 01:09:22,722
- Want a beer?
- No, I'm fine. Thanks. Are you moving?

1154
01:09:22,794 --> 01:09:25,456
- Yeah.
<i>- Where?</i>

1155
01:09:25,530 --> 01:09:27,521
New York.

1156
01:09:27,599 --> 01:09:31,433
<i>The Gray Lady came a-courtin'.</i>

1157
01:09:31,503 --> 01:09:34,404
The <i>Times</i> offered you
a permanent job?

1158
01:09:34,472 --> 01:09:37,202
I gave Arnie my notice last week.

1159
01:09:37,275 --> 01:09:40,403
- You didn't say anything.
<i>- I know. I'm sorry.</i>

1160
01:09:40,478 --> 01:09:46,075
I just- It all happened so fast,
I'm not even used to the idea yet.

1161
01:09:46,150 --> 01:09:49,916
That's great. The <i>New York Times.</i>

1162
01:09:49,988 --> 01:09:52,718
It's what we always dreamed of.

1163
01:09:56,160 --> 01:10:00,096
Well, congratulations.
I mean, you deserve it.

1164
01:10:00,164 --> 01:10:03,622
- Yeah.
- Thanks for looking after Marley.

1165
01:10:03,701 --> 01:10:06,067
- Yeah.
- He's eating your briefcase right now.

1166
01:10:06,137 --> 01:10:08,799
- Shit!
<i>- Marley. Marley, no.</i>

1167
01:10:08,873 --> 01:10:12,707
- Two days, John. I'm serious.
- Sorry.

1168
01:10:16,381 --> 01:10:19,214
Sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.

1169
01:10:19,284 --> 01:10:21,149
I wasn't, uh, sleeping.

1170
01:10:23,888 --> 01:10:27,824
<i>- Where's Marley?</i>
- Sebastian's gonna watch him for a few days.

1171
01:10:27,892 --> 01:10:30,656
Mm-hmm. I'd love to see that.

1172
01:10:30,728 --> 01:10:35,927
<i>Just until I can find
a more permanent home.</i>

1173
01:10:37,502 --> 01:10:41,063
- This is his permanent home, John.
- Mmm.

1174
01:10:41,139 --> 01:10:43,130
<i>Marley's not going anywhere.</i>
<i>Honey, I'm sorry.</i>

1175
01:10:43,207 --> 01:10:45,903
I just got overwhelmed.

1176
01:10:45,977 --> 01:10:50,846
<i>- No one tells you how hard this is all gonna be.</i>
- Which part?

1177
01:10:50,915 --> 01:10:54,009
All of it:

1178
01:10:54,085 --> 01:10:57,248
Marriage, being a parent.

1179
01:10:57,322 --> 01:11:01,122
<i>It's the hardest job in the world</i>
<i>and nobody prepares you for that.</i>

1180
01:11:01,192 --> 01:11:04,161
Nobody tells you how much
you have to give up.

1181
01:11:04,228 --> 01:11:08,858
I feel like they do tell you,
but you don't listen...

1182
01:11:08,933 --> 01:11:12,096
or you think, "Ah, they're just miserable."

1183
01:11:16,774 --> 01:11:20,335
I've given up so much
of what made me who I am.

1184
01:11:21,713 --> 01:11:23,681
But I can't say that because...

1185
01:11:23,748 --> 01:11:26,581
I'm a very bad person if I say that.

1186
01:11:28,553 --> 01:11:31,044
But I feel it. I really do.

1187
01:11:31,122 --> 01:11:35,582
I feel it sometimes. I just-

1188
01:11:35,660 --> 01:11:37,855
I just want you to know that.

1189
01:11:37,929 --> 01:11:41,797
I do know that.
And you can say it. I say it.

1190
01:11:41,866 --> 01:11:44,994
But I did make a choice.

1191
01:11:45,069 --> 01:11:49,870
I made a choice, and even
if it's harder than I thought...

1192
01:11:49,941 --> 01:11:51,966
I don't regret it.

1193
01:11:52,043 --> 01:11:54,170
- Are you sure?
- I am very sure.

1194
01:11:54,245 --> 01:11:57,874
'Cause it kinda has like a
"there's no place like home" feeling to it.

1195
01:11:57,949 --> 01:12:01,942
I just think these things are gonna happen
and we're gonna get through them.

1196
01:12:02,020 --> 01:12:06,013
- And we'll just do it together.
- Together.

1197
01:12:08,693 --> 01:12:14,063
- Getting rid of Marley is not gonna fix anything.
- No.

1198
01:12:14,132 --> 01:12:18,660
And getting rid of you
isn't gonna fix anything either.

1199
01:12:18,736 --> 01:12:20,670
- Can I ask you a favor?
- Yes.

1200
01:12:20,738 --> 01:12:23,400
No more kids for a while.

1201
01:12:23,474 --> 01:12:26,272
Absolutely. Deal.

1202
01:12:30,314 --> 01:12:34,444
Hi, guys.

1203
01:12:34,519 --> 01:12:37,010
All right, say hello to Colleen.

1204
01:12:37,088 --> 01:12:39,613
- Daddy says her name is Whoops.
- No, I-

1205
01:12:39,691 --> 01:12:42,524
<i>- Patrick said that.</i>
- What?

1206
01:12:42,593 --> 01:12:45,289
- Why did you say that?
- I was just kidding around.

1207
01:12:45,363 --> 01:12:47,627
- It was kind of a secret, guys.
- Over here.

1208
01:12:53,838 --> 01:12:56,932
The old pro moves back.
He looks for a little separation.

1209
01:12:57,008 --> 01:12:59,272
Gets an assist from Colleen.

1210
01:12:59,343 --> 01:13:01,971
Nice shot, Dad!

1211
01:13:02,046 --> 01:13:04,537
Nice shot? Come on. Conor?

1212
01:13:04,615 --> 01:13:07,209
- Extraordinary.
- Yeah. Again.

1213
01:13:07,285 --> 01:13:10,277
Wait. Let me get this. I'll be back.

1214
01:13:10,354 --> 01:13:13,881
<i>- All right.</i>
- The knees are shot.

1215
01:13:15,393 --> 01:13:17,452
- Hello?
- John Grogan?

1216
01:13:17,528 --> 01:13:19,519
Yes, it is.

1217
01:13:19,597 --> 01:13:23,499
- Gil Lawford from the <i>Philadelphia Inquirer.</i>
- Uh, yeah, yeah.

1218
01:13:25,536 --> 01:13:27,970
Hi. How are you?
Thanks for getting back to me.

1219
01:13:29,073 --> 01:13:32,839
Oh! Hey, who was that on the phone?

1220
01:13:32,910 --> 01:13:34,810
The <i>Philadelphia Inquirer.</i>

1221
01:13:34,879 --> 01:13:38,610
I sent the editor some clips
a while back and he wants to meet.

1222
01:13:38,683 --> 01:13:43,120
- What's a while back?
- He was down here on vacation a month ago.

1223
01:13:43,187 --> 01:13:46,350
And he read my stuff.
And we kind of had lunch.

1224
01:13:46,424 --> 01:13:50,087
- How do you kind of have lunch?
<i>- I didn't think anything was gonna come of it.</i>

1225
01:13:50,161 --> 01:13:51,992
<i>Okay.</i>

1226
01:13:52,063 --> 01:13:54,998
- But?
<i>- They offered me a job.</i>

1227
01:13:55,066 --> 01:13:57,762
I mean, I have an interview.

1228
01:13:57,835 --> 01:14:01,100
- As, like, a columnist or-
- As a reporter.

1229
01:14:01,172 --> 01:14:03,663
<i>As a reporter?</i>
<i>Well, what did you say?</i>

1230
01:14:03,741 --> 01:14:07,472
<i>I said, "Thank you very much,</i>
<i>but I'm happy here. "</i>

1231
01:14:07,545 --> 01:14:11,345
<i> "Never have I heard someone</i>
<i>piss and moan as much as John Grogan.</i>

1232
01:14:11,415 --> 01:14:13,508
If he doesn't like it here,
he should move."

1233
01:14:13,584 --> 01:14:16,212
That's part of my job
is to get a response.

1234
01:14:16,287 --> 01:14:19,313
- I'm glad to see a little blood
flowing from these people.
- No.

1235
01:14:19,390 --> 01:14:23,292
- There's a recurring theme here.
- Recurring theme is we got a lot
of cranks in Broward County.

1236
01:14:23,361 --> 01:14:26,125
- That's what I'm up against.
- But what I'm trying to say, with all due respect...

1237
01:14:26,197 --> 01:14:28,131
is that you are one of them!

1238
01:14:28,199 --> 01:14:30,793
I'm a commentator.
Everyone wants me to act...

1239
01:14:30,868 --> 01:14:32,893
<i>like everything's great,</i>
<i>when there are issues.</i>

1240
01:14:32,970 --> 01:14:36,997
<i>There's overcrowding, there's crime,</i>
<i>there's racial tensions.</i>

1241
01:14:37,074 --> 01:14:40,669
Every time you turn around there's a new
sky rise going up even uglier than the one-

1242
01:14:40,745 --> 01:14:44,408
That goes on all over the world.
It's not Florida. It's you. What's wrong?

1243
01:14:44,482 --> 01:14:49,510
Nothing's wrong. Everyone wants to think,
"Oh, he's turning 40. He's become a curmudgeon."

1244
01:14:49,587 --> 01:14:52,750
That's not it. Maybe-

1245
01:14:52,824 --> 01:14:56,590
I don't know. Maybe I'm sick of my column.

1246
01:14:56,661 --> 01:15:00,495
I don't- I don't find the things
I'm saying that interesting.

1247
01:15:00,565 --> 01:15:03,932
<i>John. John, you're the comic voice
of south Florida.</i>

1248
01:15:04,001 --> 01:15:06,060
You're a national treasure,
for God's sakes.

1249
01:15:06,137 --> 01:15:10,039
- Maybe a regional treasure.
- Well, a municipal treasure for sure.

1250
01:15:10,107 --> 01:15:12,974
<i>- Thank you.</i>
- Listen. Take a vacation.
Go away for a couple weeks.

1251
01:15:13,044 --> 01:15:15,706
- Take a month off.
- Go where?

1252
01:15:15,780 --> 01:15:19,716
- I don't know.
- I live in a vacation spot.

1253
01:15:19,784 --> 01:15:23,515
Then go to someplace where it's painful and sad.

1254
01:15:33,331 --> 01:15:38,234
Oh, 40's gonna be tough, buddy.
I'm not gonna lie to you.

1255
01:15:40,104 --> 01:15:42,038
But we knew that.

1256
01:15:42,106 --> 01:15:45,507
We knew this was when
Father Time was gonna make his move.

1257
01:15:45,576 --> 01:15:48,739
Try to take us down a dark alley
and beat the hell out of us.

1258
01:15:48,813 --> 01:15:52,579
You got a little more
white around the temple...

1259
01:15:52,650 --> 01:15:56,416
but makes you look
more distinguished, I think.

1260
01:15:56,487 --> 01:15:58,455
We both lost a step.

1261
01:15:58,522 --> 01:16:01,252
I know.

1262
01:16:01,325 --> 01:16:04,590
How does it feel to have
your best years behind you?

1263
01:16:04,662 --> 01:16:07,563
You do everything you wanted to?

1264
01:16:07,632 --> 01:16:09,998
No, me neither.

1265
01:16:12,270 --> 01:16:16,502
All right. You hot?
You wanna cool off? Let's do it.

1266
01:16:21,245 --> 01:16:24,908
<i>You know what? Not today.</i>

1267
01:16:26,284 --> 01:16:29,412
You've been on a leash
a little too long.

1268
01:16:29,487 --> 01:16:32,149
Go! Go!

1269
01:16:37,328 --> 01:16:39,660
I think he got a little bit
of a second wind.

1270
01:16:50,441 --> 01:16:52,636
Go get it!

1271
01:16:55,279 --> 01:16:58,442
<i>Happiness more or less</i>

1272
01:16:58,516 --> 01:17:02,008

01:17:02,086 --> 01:17:06,455

<i>With fire in my hands</i>

1279
01:17:27,244 --> 01:17:29,974

- What?

1280
01:17:36,587 --> 01:17:38,817
No! No! Please, God, no!

1281
01:17:38,889 --> 01:17:42,916
<i>No! No! No! No.</i>

1282
01:17:45,930 --> 01:17:48,490
Come on!

1283
01:17:48,566 --> 01:17:51,558
Come here. Come here. That's okay.

1284
01:17:51,635 --> 01:17:55,594
Dude, that was not cool.

1285
01:17:55,673 --> 01:17:58,733
Come on, girl. Let's go.

1286
01:18:02,913 --> 01:18:04,710
Great.

1287
01:18:07,251 --> 01:18:09,913
Let's go.

1288
01:18:12,990 --> 01:18:17,017
Man, you are the world's worst dog.

1289
01:18:17,094 --> 01:18:19,153
You know that? Right?

1290
01:18:19,230 --> 01:18:21,664
You were top five
going into the day...

1291
01:18:21,732 --> 01:18:24,997
and with this little stunt,
you moved into number one.

1292
01:18:25,069 --> 01:18:27,867
And I take my hat off to you.

1293
01:18:37,982 --> 01:18:40,109
Surprise!

1294
01:18:50,628 --> 01:18:54,029
Happy birthday to you

1295
01:18:54,098 --> 01:18:59,502
Happy birthday, dear John

1296
01:18:59,570 --> 01:19:04,701
Happy birthday to you

1297
01:19:04,775 --> 01:19:08,142
Happy birthday.

1298
01:19:08,212 --> 01:19:13,650
You can help me. Hold on.
Hold on. On three. One, two, three.

1299
01:19:21,325 --> 01:19:23,987
But don't beg, Marley.

1300
01:19:24,061 --> 01:19:27,690
It's not good. 'Cause we don't have to.

1301
01:19:29,633 --> 01:19:32,966
Tell me the truth.
Were you surprised?

1302
01:19:33,037 --> 01:19:35,870
- Completely. Yes. Thank you.
- Really?

1303
01:19:35,940 --> 01:19:40,104
- I was. You guys got me.
- We got you!

1304
01:19:40,177 --> 01:19:42,611
Are you ready for
your birthday present?

1305
01:19:42,680 --> 01:19:45,581
There's more? I don't need
any other presents.

1306
01:19:50,254 --> 01:19:53,314
- Happy birthday.
- What was that?

1307
01:19:53,390 --> 01:19:57,486
That was my blessing
to take that job in Philadelphia.

1308
01:19:57,561 --> 01:20:00,655
That was months ago.
I'm not thinking about that.

1309
01:20:00,731 --> 01:20:02,699
Well, then any other job.

1310
01:20:02,766 --> 01:20:05,530
- We'll follow you wherever you wanna go.
- I understand.

1311
01:20:05,603 --> 01:20:08,094
But I'm not gonna do that.
I'm not gonna uproot us.

1312
01:20:08,172 --> 01:20:11,005
We got our friends.
The kids enjoy school.

1313
01:20:11,075 --> 01:20:13,168
And I got my poker game.
I couldn't possibly-

1314
01:20:13,244 --> 01:20:17,180
First of all, it's just an interview.
You don't have the job yet.

1315
01:20:17,248 --> 01:20:20,411
And second of all, honey,
you don't have any friends.

1316
01:20:20,484 --> 01:20:24,215
That's right. I was wondering,
who were all those strangers tonight?

1317
01:20:24,288 --> 01:20:26,552
- I hired them.
<i>- What I'm trying to say...</i>

1318
01:20:26,624 --> 01:20:28,854
is our life is here
and I'm okay with that.

1319
01:20:28,926 --> 01:20:31,986
<i>Our life is wherever</i>
<i>we are. That's it.</i>

1320
01:20:32,062 --> 01:20:33,996
- And you're not happy here.
<i>- That's not true.</i>

1321
01:20:34,064 --> 01:20:37,522
You're not happy doing that column.
You're restless and I can feel it.

1322
01:20:37,601 --> 01:20:41,332
- I'm not- I'm not.
<i>- I feel it every day that</i>
<i>you read Sebastian's articles.</i>

1323
01:20:41,405 --> 01:20:45,705
I feel it every time you sit an extra five
minutes in the driveway before you come in.

1324
01:20:45,776 --> 01:20:47,710
- I don't do that.
<i>- Yes, you do.</i>

1325
01:20:47,778 --> 01:20:49,541
I'm checking on things in the car.

1326
01:20:49,613 --> 01:20:53,572
- I just think it's time for a change.
- I'm 40,Jen.

1327
01:20:53,651 --> 01:20:57,143
Maybe at 39, but I'm too- I don't know.

1328
01:20:57,221 --> 01:21:00,748
- It feels a little late to be making big changes.
- No. No, no, no, no.

1329
01:21:00,824 --> 01:21:03,258
- Uh-uh-uh-uh. No.
- What are you doing?

1330
01:21:03,327 --> 01:21:06,091
We're not old, John.

1331
01:21:09,934 --> 01:21:12,926
We can still surprise ourselves.

1332
01:21:16,840 --> 01:21:21,607
See, most girls would do a swan dive, but
you know a cannonball is so much sexier.

1333
01:21:25,015 --> 01:21:27,609
So you ready for your other
birthday present or what?

1334
01:21:27,685 --> 01:21:29,710
Yes.

1335
01:21:29,787 --> 01:21:33,883
It's like an embarrassment
of riches, this birthday.

1336
01:21:33,958 --> 01:21:36,722
They just keep coming.
It's like Hanukkah.

1337
01:21:44,568 --> 01:21:46,866
See, we're not old.

1338
01:21:55,312 --> 01:21:57,303
<i>Grogan!</i>

1339
01:22:05,856 --> 01:22:07,983
<i>Just wanna wish you
good luck up there.</i>

1340
01:22:08,058 --> 01:22:13,758
Thanks. Yeah. It'll be good. I'm gonna
miss everybody. I'm gonna miss your laugh.

1341
01:22:13,831 --> 01:22:18,325
Yeah. There was a good chance that every
piece of advice I ever gave you was a lot of crap.

1342
01:22:18,402 --> 01:22:22,839
- No, no, no. I appreciate it just the same.
- Well, at this point...

1343
01:22:22,906 --> 01:22:27,866
a mushy guy would tell you he's proud of you,
give you a hug and send you on your way.

1344
01:22:29,546 --> 01:22:32,982
Well, I'm glad you're not that guy, sir.

1345
01:22:34,451 --> 01:22:36,442
All right. Okay.

1346
01:22:38,289 --> 01:22:41,690
Grogan, just for the record,
you surprised the hell out of me.

1347
01:22:41,759 --> 01:22:45,058
That's my specialty.

1348
01:22:45,129 --> 01:22:47,427
<i>Walking down</i>

1349
01:22:47,498 --> 01:22:51,935
<i>By the river</i>

1350
01:22:52,002 --> 01:22:54,800
<i>Water running</i>

1351
01:22:54,872 --> 01:22:59,309
<i>Through my knees</i>

1352
01:22:59,376 --> 01:23:02,277
<i>Oh, mighty river</i>

1353
01:23:02,346 --> 01:23:05,941
<i>I would love to be like you</i>

1354
01:23:06,016 --> 01:23:07,950
- Are we here yet?
- No.

1355
01:23:08,018 --> 01:23:10,418
- Now?
- We got a couple hours to go.

1356
01:23:10,487 --> 01:23:12,614
- Now?
- Soak it up.

1357
01:23:12,690 --> 01:23:14,749
- Now? Are we here yet?
- Must be near it.

1358
01:23:14,825 --> 01:23:17,191
Are we getting hot or cold?

1359
01:23:17,261 --> 01:23:19,593
- Why are we turning into here?
- We're living here.

1360
01:23:19,663 --> 01:23:24,396
- Whoa!
- I want a moment of
silence just to take this in.

1361
01:23:24,468 --> 01:23:28,962
Okay? Before the pandemonium.
Look at this.

1362
01:23:29,039 --> 01:23:32,702
- Here we go.
- Come on. We're here.

1363
01:23:39,783 --> 01:23:43,947
Marley! Marley, no!
Marley! Marley! Marley!

1364
01:23:44,021 --> 01:23:46,353
- Oh, nice.
- And we're home.

1365
01:23:53,130 --> 01:23:56,531
Hey, Andy Rooney, if you're knocking off soon,
I'll walk with you to the train.

1366
01:23:56,600 --> 01:24:00,229
Okay, I'm ready.
Put an exclamation point here.

1367
01:24:00,304 --> 01:24:04,365
Mark Twain said not to use exclamation points
'cause it's like laughing at your own joke...

1368
01:24:04,441 --> 01:24:07,968
but sometimes you gotta laugh
at your own joke 'cause it's funny.

1369
01:24:08,045 --> 01:24:12,482
It's here! It's here! It's here! It's here!
It's here! It's here! It's here! It's here!

1370
01:24:12,549 --> 01:24:16,645
- It's here! Come on. Come on!
- Over here!

1371
01:24:16,720 --> 01:24:19,154
It's here! It's here!
Come on! Marley!

1372
01:24:19,223 --> 01:24:23,159
Come on. Look it!

1373
01:24:39,243 --> 01:24:41,234
Whoa!

1374
01:24:43,147 --> 01:24:45,809
No, Marley!

1375
01:24:45,883 --> 01:24:50,843
Remember, angels can fly,
so you gotta get the wings up high.

1376
01:24:50,921 --> 01:24:53,651
Yeah. Now that one's coming.

1377
01:24:53,724 --> 01:24:56,522
- Lunch is ready!
<i>- Okay!</i>

1378
01:24:56,593 --> 01:24:59,756
- Heading in. Let's go.
- Take that!

1379
01:24:59,830 --> 01:25:01,422
- Marley!
- Come on, guys.

1380
01:25:01,498 --> 01:25:03,466
Marley, come on. Marley.

1381
01:25:03,534 --> 01:25:07,334
You know what, honey?
Let him be. He's happy.

1382
01:25:10,741 --> 01:25:12,675
Thank you.

1383
01:25:32,930 --> 01:25:37,833
What are you doing in
here? You going for the bunk bed tonight?

1384
01:25:37,901 --> 01:25:39,892
Pretty good day.

1385
01:25:39,970 --> 01:25:42,564
<i>I mean, the snow. Come on.</i>

1386
01:25:42,639 --> 01:25:45,472
All right. Sleep tight.

1387
01:25:52,850 --> 01:25:54,977
<i>- Too much color?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

1388
01:25:55,052 --> 01:25:59,455
I mean, don't get me wrong. It's a good
piece, but you're reporting now, John.

1389
01:25:59,523 --> 01:26:02,014
I want you to tell the story.
I don't want you to be in the story.

1390
01:26:02,092 --> 01:26:06,153
- I'm pretty sure I don't mention myself in there-
- The point is...

1391
01:26:06,230 --> 01:26:08,164
I still feel you in there.

1392
01:26:08,232 --> 01:26:10,860
And all I'm saying
is less you and more facts.

1393
01:26:10,934 --> 01:26:14,028
Got it.

1394
01:26:16,707 --> 01:26:19,335
- Door's always open.
- Thanks.

1395
01:26:19,409 --> 01:26:21,400
Hut!

1396
01:26:25,682 --> 01:26:28,947
Uh-oh. Here comes the old pro.

1397
01:26:29,019 --> 01:26:31,283
He shows up for the fourth quarter.

1398
01:26:31,355 --> 01:26:34,449
Yeah. Oh, yes!

1399
01:26:34,525 --> 01:26:37,858
He catches it. He fends off one guy.

1400
01:26:37,928 --> 01:26:41,694
He's running through.
He's shaking tackles left and right.

1401
01:26:41,765 --> 01:26:45,758
They can't take him down.
He's got too much- Oh!

1402
01:26:45,836 --> 01:26:49,772
Grogan goes down!
Down goes Grogan.

1403
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:52,070
- You're home early.
- That's right.

1404
01:26:52,142 --> 01:26:56,442
I had to come home and teach these kids
how to play football the right way.

1405
01:26:56,513 --> 01:26:58,378
Okay.

1406
01:26:58,448 --> 01:27:02,043
- Okay, guys, seriously, dinner's in an hour.
- Okay.

1407
01:27:02,119 --> 01:27:05,486
I want you to finish your homework and
take off those shoes before you come in.

1408
01:27:05,556 --> 01:27:07,547
- Yeah, take off your shoes!
<i>- Okay.</i>

1409
01:27:07,624 --> 01:27:11,151
Got him down. Got him down.
Got him down. Got him down.

1410
01:27:11,929 --> 01:27:13,897
Ow.

1411
01:27:15,299 --> 01:27:17,494
My God.

1412
01:27:17,568 --> 01:27:21,060
I come home and
it's like I got mugged.

1413
01:27:21,138 --> 01:27:23,333
Okay.

1414
01:27:25,175 --> 01:27:28,667
- Come on.
<i>- What's wrong with him, Dad?</i>

1415
01:27:28,745 --> 01:27:32,408
Nothing's wrong.
He's just... tired. Right, Dad?

1416
01:27:32,482 --> 01:27:35,940
Yeah. The football
took it out of him.

1417
01:27:37,387 --> 01:27:39,252
Let's go.

1418
01:27:39,489 --> 01:27:41,821
I don't know. I just don't understand.

1419
01:27:41,892 --> 01:27:45,157
A year ago, you couldn't wait
to be done with your column.

1420
01:27:45,228 --> 01:27:50,325
I know. But now I got this guy going through
every sentence with a fine-tooth comb.

1421
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:53,369
<i>I gotta admit, sometimes I miss</i>
<i>the freedom where I could just-</i>

1422
01:27:53,437 --> 01:27:57,806
- What?
- It's just- It's exhausting sometimes, John.

1423
01:27:57,874 --> 01:28:01,640
<i>You always wanting something</i>
<i>that you don't have.</i>

1424
01:28:01,712 --> 01:28:04,374
Are you happy?

1425
01:28:04,448 --> 01:28:06,882
I mean, none of this
was part of the plan.

1426
01:28:06,950 --> 01:28:10,681
No. No, it wasn't part of the plan.

1427
01:28:10,754 --> 01:28:13,621
<i>But it's so much better.</i>

1428
01:28:13,690 --> 01:28:17,319
I'm just sort of done making plans.

1429
01:28:17,394 --> 01:28:20,727
Marley! Oh, gross.

1430
01:28:20,797 --> 01:28:24,358
Hmm, seems like somebody
needs to go out. Whoo!

1431
01:28:24,434 --> 01:28:26,664
All right. Marley.

1432
01:28:26,737 --> 01:28:29,399
<i>Come on. Come on, boy.</i>

1433
01:28:31,274 --> 01:28:33,333
Oh, come on.

1434
01:28:33,410 --> 01:28:36,311
Now it's really coming down.

1435
01:28:41,418 --> 01:28:44,854
Marley? Marley?

1436
01:28:45,922 --> 01:28:47,981
Where'd he go? Marley?

1437
01:28:49,860 --> 01:28:51,828
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

1438
01:28:51,895 --> 01:28:55,626
- He's not coming back.
- Marley?

1439
01:28:55,699 --> 01:28:58,793
Well, he couldn't have gone far. Marley?

1440
01:28:59,803 --> 01:29:02,067
I'll come with you. Hold on.

1441
01:29:03,407 --> 01:29:06,376
- Marley? I don't know where he could have gone.
- Marley?

1442
01:29:06,443 --> 01:29:10,345
Well, maybe he went
next door again in the barn.

1443
01:29:10,414 --> 01:29:14,510
- I'll check in the woodshed.
- Okay.

1444
01:29:14,584 --> 01:29:16,575
Marley?

1445
01:29:21,992 --> 01:29:24,790
Marley?

1446
01:29:24,861 --> 01:29:28,957
Marley? Oh, Marley.

1447
01:29:30,534 --> 01:29:33,128
- Did you see anything?
- No, nothing.

1448
01:29:38,341 --> 01:29:42,209
- I gotta go talk to them.
- Okay.

1449
01:29:43,914 --> 01:29:46,144
Wow, it's pouring out there.

1450
01:29:46,216 --> 01:29:48,707
- Did you find him?
- You know what?

1451
01:29:48,785 --> 01:29:53,813
He's out exploring.
You know how he loves the woods.

1452
01:29:56,893 --> 01:30:01,626
Bobby says dogs, when they're
gonna die, they go away to do it.

1453
01:30:01,698 --> 01:30:03,723
That's what his beagle did.

1454
01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:07,600
Mmm. Well, you know,
that's true for beagles.

1455
01:30:07,671 --> 01:30:10,765
But, uh, not Labs like Marley.

1456
01:30:10,841 --> 01:30:14,333
<i>He's just out causing trouble.</i>
<i>Don't worry.</i>

1457
01:30:14,411 --> 01:30:17,073
Okay, now, you finished
with your homework?

1458
01:30:17,147 --> 01:30:18,739
- Yep.
- Nope.

1459
01:30:18,815 --> 01:30:21,511
<i>Nope? Well, let's make that a "yep."</i>

1460
01:30:21,585 --> 01:30:24,315
Come on now.

1461
01:30:28,525 --> 01:30:32,120
Marley! Marley!

1462
01:30:33,930 --> 01:30:37,593
Marley!

1463
01:30:42,672 --> 01:30:44,503
<i>Marley.</i>

1464
01:30:46,076 --> 01:30:50,172
Marley. Ah, Marley. You okay?

1465
01:30:53,683 --> 01:30:56,948
Stay there.

1466
01:30:57,020 --> 01:31:01,889
Why did his stomach twist? We don't
exactly know why this happens.

1467
01:31:01,958 --> 01:31:06,622
Most likely he ate or drank something
quickly and his stomach just flipped.

1468
01:31:06,696 --> 01:31:09,961
<i>I did manage to get a tube</i>
<i>down there to relieve some of the gas.</i>

1469
01:31:10,033 --> 01:31:13,491
<i>- I think I untwisted it.</i>
- He seems okay.

1470
01:31:13,570 --> 01:31:16,562
For now, he's good.

1471
01:31:16,640 --> 01:31:20,167
The problem is that once this happens,
it almost always happens again.

1472
01:31:20,243 --> 01:31:23,644
<i>And if it does, I don't know what</i>
<i>I'm gonna be able to do for him.</i>

1473
01:31:23,713 --> 01:31:27,809
He's an older dog. I honestly don't think
he would survive the surgery.

1474
01:31:27,884 --> 01:31:30,751
Well, we have to make sure
that doesn't happen again.

1475
01:31:30,821 --> 01:31:33,881
Well, most likely,
it is gonna happen again.

1476
01:31:33,957 --> 01:31:38,018
Well, we also talked about that maybe
he ate too fast or drank too quickly.

1477
01:31:38,094 --> 01:31:41,188
- Right.
- So maybe it doesn't have to happen again.

1478
01:31:41,264 --> 01:31:43,596
We'll monitor that.

1479
01:31:43,667 --> 01:31:47,535
I'm just saying you may wanna prepare yourself
that he may not make it through the night.

1480
01:31:50,140 --> 01:31:53,940
Maybe 10%% of dogs
survive this kind of a thing.

1481
01:31:54,010 --> 01:31:57,411
What-What is that number based on?

1482
01:31:57,480 --> 01:32:00,881
- What is it based on?
- Yeah, the reason why I ask...

1483
01:32:00,951 --> 01:32:03,977
is I bet that number's
based on regular dogs.

1484
01:32:04,054 --> 01:32:07,922
- Regular dogs?
- Yeah, and this guy here is not like other dogs.

1485
01:32:07,991 --> 01:32:10,892
<i>I know people probably say that</i>
<i>all the time, but to be honest...</i>

1486
01:32:10,961 --> 01:32:13,225
I'm not sure he really is a dog.

1487
01:32:13,296 --> 01:32:16,265
He once ate an answering machine.
<i>Just polished it off.</i>

1488
01:32:16,333 --> 01:32:20,736
He didn't chew it. He ate it. And then digested
it. Then went and had the phone for dessert.

1489
01:32:20,804 --> 01:32:24,934
<i>Another time, my son had colic and</i>
<i>this guy sat up all night, didn't move...</i>

1490
01:32:25,008 --> 01:32:28,535
just stayed right there for nine hours
just keeping an eye on Conor.

1491
01:32:28,612 --> 01:32:33,072
So I think maybe that
the number applies to regular dogs.

1492
01:32:33,149 --> 01:32:36,516
<i>- But not to him.</i>
- Well, you got a fighter here.

1493
01:32:36,586 --> 01:32:38,577
Let's hope for the best.

1494
01:32:38,655 --> 01:32:41,180
I know he's gonna be okay.

1495
01:32:41,258 --> 01:32:44,421
I'll see you in the morning.

1496
01:33:04,247 --> 01:33:07,011
<i>- Oh, hi.</i>
- Hey.

1497
01:33:07,083 --> 01:33:09,551
They're gonna-They're gonna
keep him overnight.

1498
01:33:09,619 --> 01:33:12,349
But he seemed better when I left.

1499
01:33:12,422 --> 01:33:15,687
The vet really seemed on top of it.

1500
01:33:17,961 --> 01:33:21,897
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. What are you reading?

1501
01:33:21,965 --> 01:33:24,297
I'm reading your old columns.

1502
01:33:27,170 --> 01:33:29,570
Marley's in so many of them.

1503
01:33:29,639 --> 01:33:31,732
You still look at those?

1504
01:33:31,808 --> 01:33:33,833
Yeah, I do sometimes.

1505
01:33:35,979 --> 01:33:38,948
Even on the crappiest days-

1506
01:33:39,015 --> 01:33:44,078
the kids are driving me nuts,
laundry's not done...

1507
01:33:44,154 --> 01:33:46,918
and a hundred other things are wrong-

1508
01:33:46,990 --> 01:33:49,584
I always know that I have this.

1509
01:33:51,561 --> 01:33:54,724
It's five minutes of you.

1510
01:33:54,798 --> 01:33:59,929
Sometimes they're sad
and sometimes they're really funny...

1511
01:34:00,003 --> 01:34:04,235
silly or whatever,
but- but they're all you.

1512
01:34:06,042 --> 01:34:08,510
And for those five minutes...

1513
01:34:08,578 --> 01:34:11,046
you make me feel better.

1514
01:34:24,761 --> 01:34:27,787
You should read them.
They're pretty great.

1515
01:34:29,632 --> 01:34:31,896
Might even make a nice book.

1516
01:34:31,968 --> 01:34:35,301
- A book?
- Something.

1517
01:34:50,687 --> 01:34:52,678
Hello?

1518
01:34:54,491 --> 01:34:57,221
All right. Thank you.

1519
01:34:58,695 --> 01:35:01,129
He's coming home.

1520
01:35:11,808 --> 01:35:13,833
Is he there?

1521
01:35:13,910 --> 01:35:17,107
Of course he's there.
He's always there.

1522
01:35:17,180 --> 01:35:22,083
- How does he know we're coming?
- I don't know. He just knows.

1523
01:35:22,152 --> 01:35:24,279
Dogs know stuff like that.

1524
01:35:24,354 --> 01:35:27,221
- All dogs?
- All good dogs.

1525
01:35:27,290 --> 01:35:30,919
- Look, there he is! There he is! Marley.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

1526
01:35:35,732 --> 01:35:37,757
Hi, Marley.

1527
01:35:37,834 --> 01:35:39,768
- Marley.
- How you doin', Marley.

1528
01:35:39,836 --> 01:35:42,999
- I missed you at school.
- I'll race you to the house.

1529
01:35:43,073 --> 01:35:45,405
- Okay.
- Go!

1530
01:35:52,082 --> 01:35:55,415
<i>- Eagles?</i>
<i>- Yeah, the Eagles are going all the way.</i>

1531
01:35:55,485 --> 01:35:57,612
I guarantee you.
What are you, a Dolphins fan?

1532
01:35:57,687 --> 01:35:59,951
- No.
- John Grogan!

1533
01:36:00,023 --> 01:36:02,992
- Hey. I'll see you tomorrow.
- All right, dude. See you tomorrow.

1534
01:36:03,059 --> 01:36:06,256
<i>I said to myself, "That sorry</i>
<i>son of a bitch looks like John Grogan. "</i>

1535
01:36:06,329 --> 01:36:11,596
- What are you doing here?
- Ah, story. D.A.'s showing off
the new field office and-

1536
01:36:11,668 --> 01:36:14,728
You know what? It doesn't matter.
Man, it is good to see you.

1537
01:36:14,804 --> 01:36:17,102
- It's good to see you.
- Yeah.

1538
01:36:17,173 --> 01:36:20,199
- So you living in the city somewhere?
- I live just outside of town.

1539
01:36:20,276 --> 01:36:23,006
- More space for the kids.
- What do you got, like five now?

1540
01:36:23,079 --> 01:36:27,345
Three. Here. Show you a little
snapshot of the Grogan brood.

1541
01:36:28,685 --> 01:36:31,381
- Wow, Jen's holding up.
- Yeah.

1542
01:36:31,454 --> 01:36:33,854
Thanks, I think.

1543
01:36:33,923 --> 01:36:36,050
I see you-you finally
got a little girl, huh?

1544
01:36:36,126 --> 01:36:39,152
<i>Colleen. She arrived after you left.</i>

1545
01:36:39,229 --> 01:36:43,256
- What's with the ladybug getup?
- That was for her school play in preschool.

1546
01:36:43,333 --> 01:36:46,962
And then we couldn't get her out of
her costume for, like, a month afterwards.

1547
01:36:47,036 --> 01:36:49,869
And the reason why Marley
looks like he's biting her head...

1548
01:36:49,939 --> 01:36:52,567
<i>is because the antennas on it-</i>
<i>he went ballistic.</i>

1549
01:36:52,642 --> 01:36:55,839
- Things don't change.
- That's right.

1550
01:36:58,214 --> 01:37:02,480
- I wish I didn't have this interview.
- That's okay. I gotta get home.

1551
01:37:02,552 --> 01:37:04,747
Conor's got a soccer game.

1552
01:37:04,821 --> 01:37:07,255
All right. Well, one of these days
we gotta catch up.

1553
01:37:07,323 --> 01:37:10,315
Yeah, let's do that.
We'll catch up one of these days.

1554
01:37:10,393 --> 01:37:13,954
- Well, it was, uh, good to see you.
- Come here. Good to see you.

1555
01:37:14,030 --> 01:37:16,828
- Give Jenny my best, okay?
- I will.

1556
01:37:16,900 --> 01:37:18,993
- Oh, uh, here. Here.
- Oh, yeah.

1557
01:37:19,068 --> 01:37:22,504
That's, uh-That's a great picture, John.

1558
01:37:22,572 --> 01:37:25,666
- You did okay.
- Thanks.

1559
01:37:25,742 --> 01:37:29,838
- You did okay too. I'll see ya.
- I'll see ya.

1560
01:37:29,913 --> 01:37:32,473
I think you'll like the next one better.

1561
01:37:32,549 --> 01:37:34,608
<i>Really?</i>

1562
01:37:34,684 --> 01:37:38,780
Don't do it to yourself. We're in Philly.
Let's get a cheesesteak. Hi.

1563
01:37:38,855 --> 01:37:42,222
<i>- Sebastian. Nice to meet you.</i>
<i>- Nice to meet you.</i>

1564
01:37:45,929 --> 01:37:47,920
Hello?

1565
01:37:53,036 --> 01:37:54,970
Is anybody home?

1566
01:38:00,076 --> 01:38:03,443
Marley. Hey, Marley.
Marley. Marley.

1567
01:38:03,513 --> 01:38:06,778
Hey. Hey. Marley. Marley.

1568
01:38:06,849 --> 01:38:09,613
Marley.

1569
01:38:09,686 --> 01:38:11,779
You didn't hear me, did you?

1570
01:38:11,854 --> 01:38:15,654
I just caught you
in a senior moment there, Marley.

1571
01:38:15,725 --> 01:38:19,957
All right, let's go for a walk.
Come on. Let's go.

1572
01:38:31,874 --> 01:38:34,900
Come on. Come on.

1573
01:38:34,978 --> 01:38:37,037
You're almost to the top.

1574
01:38:37,113 --> 01:38:39,104
You know what? Come here.

1575
01:38:39,182 --> 01:38:41,616
This is a good spot right here.

1576
01:38:50,627 --> 01:38:55,121
I know you're a strong boy,
but you're gonna let me know, right?

1577
01:38:55,198 --> 01:38:58,031
You know, when it's time.

1578
01:38:58,101 --> 01:39:01,298
I don't wanna make
that decision on my own.

1579
01:39:02,472 --> 01:39:05,805
You let me know
when you're ready, okay?

1580
01:39:10,213 --> 01:39:12,147
All right.

1581
01:39:21,024 --> 01:39:22,958
<i>Marley?</i>

1582
01:39:24,627 --> 01:39:27,187
There he is.

1583
01:39:27,263 --> 01:39:30,061
Marley.

1584
01:39:30,133 --> 01:39:33,193
Ah, honey, what are you
doing down here?

1585
01:39:33,269 --> 01:39:37,365
It's time to head upstairs.
You don't sleep down here.

1586
01:39:37,440 --> 01:39:41,342
Come on. Can you make it upstairs?

1587
01:39:43,780 --> 01:39:46,681
I think he's pretty
comfortable down here.

1588
01:39:48,151 --> 01:39:51,245
- I'll get him a blanket.
- You all right?

1589
01:39:56,793 --> 01:40:00,229
Lay down here for a second.

1590
01:40:00,296 --> 01:40:02,787
Take a load off.

1591
01:40:04,734 --> 01:40:09,228
Yeah. It's actually nice down here.

1592
01:40:09,305 --> 01:40:11,398
This might be better.

1593
01:40:15,411 --> 01:40:17,811
- It'd be twice a week, 600 words.
- And what's the subject?

1594
01:40:17,880 --> 01:40:21,475
You know, everyday stuff.
The stuff we all go through, but funnier.

1595
01:40:21,551 --> 01:40:24,384
I don't get it, John. I thought
you came here to be a reporter.

1596
01:40:24,454 --> 01:40:26,684
I know I did, but I think
we both know that isn't me.

1597
01:40:26,756 --> 01:40:29,748
- I'm a columnist- a good one.
<i>- Excuse me, John.</i>

1598
01:40:29,826 --> 01:40:33,557
- Your wife's on the phone. She said it's important.
- Okay, I'll be right there.

1599
01:40:33,629 --> 01:40:36,393
Think about it. Possible?

1600
01:40:37,433 --> 01:40:39,367
- Thanks. Hello?
- You're welcome.

1601
01:40:39,435 --> 01:40:41,869
I can't get him to come back inside.

1602
01:40:41,938 --> 01:40:46,705
<i>He's just laying out there</i>
<i>in the cold and he won't move.</i>

1603
01:40:59,122 --> 01:41:01,750
- Hey.
<i>- Hi.</i>

1604
01:41:01,824 --> 01:41:04,292
Patrick came home.
We got him here.

1605
01:41:04,360 --> 01:41:09,923
Dr. Platt said that if he's comfortable,
leave him for a while and see, but...

1606
01:41:09,999 --> 01:41:12,763
he's just not getting better.

1607
01:41:15,905 --> 01:41:18,135
All right, I'm gonna take him in.

1608
01:41:19,776 --> 01:41:22,904
- Is he sick again?
<i>- Yeah, he is, honey.</i>

1609
01:41:22,979 --> 01:41:25,106
He doesn't feel too good.

1610
01:41:25,181 --> 01:41:28,173
But I'm gonna take him into the doctor
and they're gonna try to make him feel better.

1611
01:41:28,251 --> 01:41:30,583
It's all right, Marley.
You're gonna be okay.

1612
01:41:36,058 --> 01:41:41,086
You could take Lamby,
but don't chew her other ear off.

1613
01:41:41,164 --> 01:41:43,655
<i>That's sweet, honey.</i>

1614
01:41:43,733 --> 01:41:45,792
Here, I'll take it.

1615
01:41:49,071 --> 01:41:51,096
Good-bye.

1616
01:42:34,884 --> 01:42:36,977
Okay.

1617
01:43:00,076 --> 01:43:04,012
I've tried everything I did last time
that worked, but I'm not having any luck.

1618
01:43:04,080 --> 01:43:07,174
Not able to get the tube down there.

1619
01:43:07,250 --> 01:43:11,084
The stomach is still twisted.
There's still surgery, but-

1620
01:43:11,153 --> 01:43:14,384
He's not strong enough.

1621
01:43:23,366 --> 01:43:26,494
- I like this one the best.
- Which one?

1622
01:43:26,569 --> 01:43:28,901
Oh, the mangoes. Yeah.

1623
01:43:28,971 --> 01:43:32,463
Hello?

1624
01:43:32,542 --> 01:43:34,703
Hey, it's me.

1625
01:43:34,777 --> 01:43:37,473
So, it's his stomach again.

1626
01:43:37,547 --> 01:43:41,813
- And they could do surgery, but-
- I know.

1627
01:43:41,884 --> 01:43:46,753
Do you want me to come down there?

1628
01:43:46,822 --> 01:43:49,723
No, no, I think it's a good idea
to stay with the kids...

1629
01:43:49,792 --> 01:43:52,090
and be with them.

1630
01:43:52,161 --> 01:43:56,655
I'm just gonna-

1631
01:44:03,673 --> 01:44:05,641
I love you, John.

1632
01:44:07,009 --> 01:44:09,000
I love you.

1633
01:44:14,083 --> 01:44:16,916
- All right.
- I'm gonna give you some time.

1634
01:44:16,986 --> 01:44:19,216
- Okay.
- And I'll be right outside if you need me.

1635
01:44:19,288 --> 01:44:21,279
All right. Thanks.

1636
01:44:23,259 --> 01:44:27,423
Look what I got for you.
Remember this?

1637
01:44:27,496 --> 01:44:32,900
What did Colleen say to you?
You remember that?

1638
01:44:32,969 --> 01:44:36,370
You remember chewing up that ear?

1639
01:44:36,439 --> 01:44:40,603
Well, it's tough to remember
all the things you've chewed up, isn't it?

1640
01:44:40,676 --> 01:44:43,372
It all starts to kind of run together.

1641
01:45:17,580 --> 01:45:20,413
It's okay. You don't have to do anything.

1642
01:45:22,251 --> 01:45:25,846
You don't have your usual energy.

1643
01:45:25,921 --> 01:45:29,880
You remember how we were
always saying what a pain you are-

1644
01:45:29,959 --> 01:45:32,450
that you're the world's worst dog?

1645
01:45:34,130 --> 01:45:36,155
Don't believe it.

1646
01:45:36,232 --> 01:45:38,564
Don't believe any
of it for a minute.

1647
01:45:38,634 --> 01:45:42,092
'Cause you know
we couldn't find a better dog.

1648
01:45:44,907 --> 01:45:48,070
You know what made you
such a... great dog-

1649
01:45:48,144 --> 01:45:52,137
is you loved us every day,
no matter what.

1650
01:45:52,214 --> 01:45:54,239
That's an amazing thing.

1651
01:45:54,316 --> 01:45:57,752
You know how much we love you?

1652
01:45:57,820 --> 01:46:00,015
We love you so much.

1653
01:46:03,826 --> 01:46:06,317
I love you more than anything.

1654
01:46:07,730 --> 01:46:12,793
I don't know exactly
where we go from here...

1655
01:46:12,868 --> 01:46:16,599
but I want you to remember
you're a great dog, Marley.

1656
01:46:16,672 --> 01:46:19,664
You're a great dog.

1657
01:46:31,320 --> 01:46:33,914
<i>He won't feel this.
He'll just slip away.</i>

1658
01:46:33,989 --> 01:46:35,980
You ready?

1659
01:46:38,627 --> 01:46:40,720
- Yeah, we're ready.
<i>- Okay.</i>

1660
01:48:44,553 --> 01:48:47,579
Okay. Get down.

1661
01:48:53,095 --> 01:48:56,792
- He's wrapped in his blanket.
<i>- So he can stay warm.</i>

1662
01:48:56,866 --> 01:48:59,926
Do you guys wanna read
what you wrote?

1663
01:49:01,804 --> 01:49:03,829
Mine's a picture of me and Marley...

1664
01:49:03,906 --> 01:49:06,534
grasshoppers and ice cream.

1665
01:49:06,609 --> 01:49:08,600
Mommy wrote what I said.

1666
01:49:08,677 --> 01:49:14,081
<i>"Dear Marley, I will</i>
<i>never forget you forever. Colleen. "</i>

1667
01:49:14,149 --> 01:49:16,913
And these are kisses.

1668
01:49:16,986 --> 01:49:19,614
- That's beautiful.
<i>- Thank you.</i>

1669
01:49:19,688 --> 01:49:22,555
You wanna put it in?
He'll like that.

1670
01:49:22,625 --> 01:49:24,889
<i>Set it down.</i>

1671
01:49:26,295 --> 01:49:28,229
Good.

1672
01:49:28,297 --> 01:49:32,165
That's a great picture.
Conor, do you wanna-

1673
01:49:35,604 --> 01:49:38,471
"Dear Marley, I loved you all my life.

1674
01:49:38,540 --> 01:49:41,805
"I hope you like heaven
and that there's lots to chew on.

1675
01:49:41,877 --> 01:49:45,335
<i>Your brother, Conor Richard Grogan. "

1676
01:49:48,884 --> 01:49:51,648
<i>That was a good letter.</i>

1677
01:49:51,720 --> 01:49:54,917
Patrick, do you wanna say something?

1678
01:49:56,225 --> 01:49:59,160
He knows.

1679
01:50:02,264 --> 01:50:04,926
I'd like to give him something.

1680
01:50:11,240 --> 01:50:13,231
This necklace.

1681
01:50:15,077 --> 01:50:17,944
It's been on quite a journey.

1682
01:50:24,153 --> 01:50:27,714
Your dad gave it to me...

1683
01:50:27,790 --> 01:50:31,123
to celebrate the beginning
of our family.

1684
01:50:31,193 --> 01:50:34,060
But, you know-

1685
01:50:34,129 --> 01:50:36,893
Our family had really already begun.

1686
01:50:43,639 --> 01:50:45,732
Bye, Clearance Puppy.

1687
01:51:13,135 --> 01:51:15,296
<i>A dog has no use for fancy cars...</i>

1688
01:51:15,371 --> 01:51:18,568
<i>or big homes or designer clothes.</i>

1689
01:51:18,640 --> 01:51:22,076
<i>A waterlogged stick</i>
<i>will do just fine.</i>

1690
01:51:22,144 --> 01:51:24,806
<i>A dog doesn't care</i>

1691
01:51:24,880 --> 01:51:28,281

1692
01:51:28,350 --> 01:51:31,683
<i>Give 'em your heart</i>
<i>and he'll give you his.</i>

1693
01:51:37,760 --> 01:51:40,695
<i>How many people</i>
<i>can you say that about?</i>

1694
01:51:40,763 --> 01:51:45,530
<i>How many people can make you</i>
<i>feel rare and pure and special?</i>

1695
01:51:50,372 --> 01:51:55,537
<i>How many people can</i>
<i>make you feel... extraordinary?</i>
