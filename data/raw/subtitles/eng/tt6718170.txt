1
00:00:31,112 --> 00:00:33,807
Illumination!

2
00:02:18,111 --> 00:02:22,982
Behold! The king of the Koopas!

3
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:52,044
Open the gates or die.

4
00:03:12,405 --> 00:03:15,540
Attack!

5
00:03:29,325 --> 00:03:32,215
That is but a taste of our fury.

6
00:03:32,216 --> 00:03:34,889
Do you yield?

7
00:03:37,254 --> 00:03:38,893
I do not.

8
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,688
No.

9
00:04:07,286 --> 00:04:09,022
Ah.

10
00:04:25,073 --> 00:04:26,710
Ah.

11
00:04:38,623 --> 00:04:40,591
I've finally found it.

12
00:04:40,592 --> 00:04:44,662
And now no one can stop me!

13
00:04:57,873 --> 00:04:59,610
- ♪ Huh! ♪
- It's-a me, a-Mario.

14
00:04:59,611 --> 00:05:01,040
And-a Luigi.

15
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:03,416
Are you-a tired of a-paying
too much for plumbing?

16
00:05:03,417 --> 00:05:04,846
Mamma mia!

17
00:05:04,847 --> 00:05:07,244
That's why the Super Mario
Brothers are here.

18
00:05:07,245 --> 00:05:08,344
A-to save Brooklyn.

19
00:05:08,345 --> 00:05:09,422
And-a Queens.

20
00:05:09,423 --> 00:05:10,588
And-a your wallet.

21
00:05:10,589 --> 00:05:12,051
Thank you, Super Mario Bros.

22
00:05:12,052 --> 00:05:14,251
It seems like the only thing
you haven't drained

23
00:05:14,252 --> 00:05:15,923
is my bank account.

24
00:05:15,924 --> 00:05:17,892
Forget-a the expensive
a-plumbing companies

25
00:05:17,893 --> 00:05:19,630
a-where you're just a face-a.

26
00:05:19,631 --> 00:05:22,468
With-a Super Mario Brothers-a,
you're family.

27
00:05:25,505 --> 00:05:26,934
Oh, wow.

28
00:05:26,935 --> 00:05:28,903
- You were great.
- I was great?

29
00:05:28,904 --> 00:05:31,807
Are you kidding me?
You were great!

30
00:05:31,808 --> 00:05:35,239
I am so glad we spent our life
savings on this commercial.

31
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,076
That is not a commercial.

32
00:05:37,077 --> 00:05:38,616
That is cinema.

33
00:05:38,617 --> 00:05:41,421
Uh, what about the accents?
Is it... is it too much?

34
00:05:41,422 --> 00:05:44,083
Too much-a? It's-a perfect.

35
00:05:44,084 --> 00:05:45,348
Wahoo!

36
00:05:45,349 --> 00:05:47,086
Okay, I'm gonna trust you.

37
00:05:47,087 --> 00:05:51,222
Well, well, well, if it isn't
Brooklyn's favorite failures,

38
00:05:51,223 --> 00:05:53,356
the Stupid Mario Brothers.

39
00:05:53,357 --> 00:05:55,160
Ah, great. Spike's here.

40
00:05:55,161 --> 00:05:56,502
Hey, Spike.

41
00:05:56,503 --> 00:05:58,571
Yeah. "It's-a me!"

42
00:06:00,573 --> 00:06:02,068
Whew, yeah.

43
00:06:02,069 --> 00:06:05,709
Tell me, have you even
gotten one call

44
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:08,404
since you left me
to start your dumb company?

45
00:06:08,405 --> 00:06:11,550
As a matter of fact,
Spike, we have.

46
00:06:11,551 --> 00:06:14,014
- Wow. Really?
- Uh, yeah.

47
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:16,049
Our mom called,
and she said, "Oh, boys,

48
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:18,216
that's the best commercial
I've ever seen."

49
00:06:18,217 --> 00:06:20,317
And I said,
"Thank you very much, Mother.

50
00:06:20,318 --> 00:06:21,692
We're very proud of it."

51
00:06:21,693 --> 00:06:24,322
So, boom!

52
00:06:26,192 --> 00:06:29,392
Good luck running a business
with this idiot.

53
00:06:29,393 --> 00:06:31,735
Say that again about my brother,

54
00:06:31,736 --> 00:06:34,002
and you're gonna regret it.

55
00:06:36,171 --> 00:06:37,203
Oh, yeah?

56
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:41,074
Get this through
your tiny brain, Mario.

57
00:06:41,075 --> 00:06:46,014
You're a joke,
and you always will be.

58
00:06:53,923 --> 00:06:56,727
Are you insane?
He's three times your size.

59
00:06:56,728 --> 00:06:58,124
Luigi, come on.

60
00:06:58,125 --> 00:06:59,895
You know, you can't be scared
all the time.

61
00:06:59,896 --> 00:07:01,766
Mm, you'd be surprised.

62
00:07:07,939 --> 00:07:10,433
Hello. Super Mario Brothers.

63
00:07:10,434 --> 00:07:11,742
Uh-huh.

64
00:07:11,743 --> 00:07:13,876
A drip in your faucet?
That's great!

65
00:07:13,877 --> 00:07:16,010
I mean, that's-that's great
you called us,

66
00:07:16,011 --> 00:07:18,980
because we can be there and
we can fix it right away. Okay.

67
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:20,916
Mario, we got one!

68
00:07:20,917 --> 00:07:25,019
The Super Mario Brothers
are in business!

69
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,285
Woo-hoo!

70
00:07:34,359 --> 00:07:35,931
Oh, no. We're gonna be late.

71
00:07:35,932 --> 00:07:38,099
No, we're not.
Come on, let's go.

72
00:07:39,606 --> 00:07:40,738
Hey, wait up!

73
00:07:40,739 --> 00:07:42,806
This way.

74
00:07:42,807 --> 00:07:43,972
Aah!

75
00:07:43,973 --> 00:07:46,712
Come on, Lu. Step on it.

76
00:07:48,076 --> 00:07:50,209
Excuse you.
Here you go.

77
00:07:56,249 --> 00:08:00,153
Oh, Mario, what are you doing?

78
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:04,729
Hey!

79
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:06,633
Get off of there!

80
00:08:09,427 --> 00:08:11,263
You can't be in... Whoa!

81
00:08:11,264 --> 00:08:13,265
- My bad!
- Move it up!

82
00:08:13,266 --> 00:08:14,464
Oh, I'm so s-sorry.

83
00:08:14,465 --> 00:08:17,270
Hey, we're working here!
So sorry.

84
00:08:22,077 --> 00:08:23,682
Come on, Luigi. Pump those legs.

85
00:08:23,683 --> 00:08:25,541
Oh, I'm trying. I'm trying.

86
00:08:25,542 --> 00:08:27,753
I got bad knees.

87
00:08:33,319 --> 00:08:34,484
Oh, wow.

88
00:08:34,485 --> 00:08:36,729
We have hit the big time.

89
00:08:38,423 --> 00:08:40,963
The drip is right upstairs
at the end of the hall.

90
00:08:40,964 --> 00:08:43,064
- Can you fix it?
- Very confident, sir.

91
00:08:43,065 --> 00:08:44,560
You'll be careful
about making a mess?

92
00:08:44,561 --> 00:08:47,607
Ma'am, I assure you,
we don't make messes.

93
00:08:47,608 --> 00:08:49,874
We fix 'em.

94
00:08:50,712 --> 00:08:51,908
That's Francis.

95
00:08:51,909 --> 00:08:53,878
He likes you.

96
00:08:59,015 --> 00:09:00,951
Hey.

97
00:09:02,053 --> 00:09:04,119
Mama, mama, mama love ya, baby.

98
00:09:11,357 --> 00:09:12,424
Wrench.

99
00:09:15,671 --> 00:09:17,032
Mm-hmm.

100
00:09:17,033 --> 00:09:19,563
And a first job complete.

101
00:09:21,565 --> 00:09:23,600
Hey!

102
00:09:24,744 --> 00:09:26,438
Francis is here.

103
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:34,721
Hey there, pal.

104
00:09:39,517 --> 00:09:41,585
Mario, do something!

105
00:09:52,037 --> 00:09:54,873
Mamma mia!

106
00:09:59,781 --> 00:10:01,274
Whew.

107
00:10:01,275 --> 00:10:03,244
Uh, Mario?

108
00:10:34,112 --> 00:10:37,113
That hellhound is gonna escape!

109
00:10:37,753 --> 00:10:39,247
No, he won't.

110
00:10:45,684 --> 00:10:46,825
Whew.

111
00:10:46,826 --> 00:10:49,224
Hey, uh, Mario?

112
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:53,195
Uh, who's a good puppy?

113
00:10:54,735 --> 00:10:56,495
Who's a good boy?

114
00:11:04,844 --> 00:11:06,538
Hmm?

115
00:11:07,475 --> 00:11:09,343
Hmm.

116
00:11:20,994 --> 00:11:22,422
Found the problem.

117
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:24,621
Ma, did you make these?

118
00:11:24,622 --> 00:11:25,963
Ah, good batch, eh?

119
00:11:25,964 --> 00:11:26,964
Why don't you make it like this?

120
00:11:26,965 --> 00:11:28,592
Hey-o!

121
00:11:28,593 --> 00:11:30,132
Hey-o!

122
00:11:30,133 --> 00:11:35,402
Oh! It's the Super Mario
Brothers, from the TV.

123
00:11:37,008 --> 00:11:38,877
They give an Oscar
for worst actors?

124
00:11:38,878 --> 00:11:40,670
- Hey!
- What'd I do?

125
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,946
So, uh...

126
00:11:41,947 --> 00:11:43,607
so everybody saw
the commercial, then?

127
00:11:43,608 --> 00:11:46,016
- Uh-huh. We seen it.
- And?

128
00:11:46,017 --> 00:11:47,446
I wouldn't quit your day job.

129
00:11:47,447 --> 00:11:50,251
Oops! He already did.

130
00:11:50,252 --> 00:11:52,682
Well, I thought
it was incredible.

131
00:11:52,683 --> 00:11:54,960
It belongs in a movie theater.

132
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:57,225
Ugh. Mushrooms?

133
00:11:57,226 --> 00:11:58,864
Everybody loves mushrooms, right?

134
00:11:58,865 --> 00:12:00,096
I like mushrooms.

135
00:12:00,097 --> 00:12:01,394
- I'll take it.
- Yeah.

136
00:12:01,395 --> 00:12:02,527
Mario, seriously,

137
00:12:02,528 --> 00:12:04,463
what were you thinking
with that commercial?

138
00:12:04,464 --> 00:12:06,234
What? It's supposed to be funny.

139
00:12:06,235 --> 00:12:07,466
Can someone pass the bread?

140
00:12:07,467 --> 00:12:09,171
Yeah, but what's with
the outfits?

141
00:12:09,172 --> 00:12:10,667
Plumbers wearing white gloves?

142
00:12:10,668 --> 00:12:12,504
That's right,
you got to have a trademark.

143
00:12:12,505 --> 00:12:13,670
Got to stand out.

144
00:12:13,671 --> 00:12:14,913
Don't listen to them.

145
00:12:14,914 --> 00:12:16,948
The world laughed
at da Vinci, too.

146
00:12:16,949 --> 00:12:18,818
Mm, I'm not sure they did, Ma.

147
00:12:18,819 --> 00:12:21,513
Dad, what did you think?

148
00:12:21,514 --> 00:12:23,350
I think you're nuts.

149
00:12:23,351 --> 00:12:27,827
You don't leave a steady job
for some crazy dream.

150
00:12:27,828 --> 00:12:29,191
And the worst part?

151
00:12:29,192 --> 00:12:32,029
You're bringing your brother
down with you.

152
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:33,866
Well, thanks, Dad.

153
00:12:33,867 --> 00:12:36,331
Thanks for your support.

154
00:12:38,269 --> 00:12:40,434
What'd I say?

155
00:12:51,513 --> 00:12:54,579
Thanks for tuning in
to News Channel 4.

156
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:56,153
Hey.

157
00:12:57,893 --> 00:13:00,156
Uh, you're not bringing me down.

158
00:13:00,157 --> 00:13:03,093
You know what?
What do they know, huh?

159
00:13:03,094 --> 00:13:04,622
It's not just them.

160
00:13:04,623 --> 00:13:06,195
Our whole lives,
everyone's telling us

161
00:13:06,196 --> 00:13:08,362
we can't do this,
we can't do that.

162
00:13:08,363 --> 00:13:11,233
I'm just sick and tired
of feeling so small.

163
00:13:11,234 --> 00:13:13,334
A water main burst
underground today,

164
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:15,733
stopping subway service
and flooding Downtown Brooklyn.

165
00:13:17,042 --> 00:13:18,504
Everything is under control,
I promise you.

166
00:13:18,505 --> 00:13:20,176
We are very close
to fixing this.

167
00:13:20,177 --> 00:13:21,771
Out of the way!

168
00:13:21,772 --> 00:13:23,146
Go back!
Somebody, help!

169
00:13:23,147 --> 00:13:24,675
Somebody, save Brooklyn!

170
00:13:24,676 --> 00:13:27,051
Save Brooklyn?

171
00:13:27,052 --> 00:13:30,120
Luigi, this is our chance.

172
00:13:30,121 --> 00:13:31,616
Destiny is calling.

173
00:13:31,617 --> 00:13:33,849
Destiny Del Vecchio
from high school?

174
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:35,158
What? No.

175
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:37,161
Just come on.

176
00:13:38,494 --> 00:13:41,528
It's more than
the storm drains can handle!

177
00:13:42,564 --> 00:13:45,235
Come on! We got to pump it!

178
00:13:49,175 --> 00:13:50,636
I got this.

179
00:13:52,077 --> 00:13:54,375
They're not even looking
in the right place.

180
00:13:54,376 --> 00:13:56,114
Come on, Lu.

181
00:14:04,487 --> 00:14:06,717
You are not seriously considering...

182
00:14:06,718 --> 00:14:07,994
Mario!

183
00:14:16,972 --> 00:14:19,940
We got to get
to that pressure valve.

184
00:14:21,942 --> 00:14:24,274
Mamma mia.

185
00:14:51,567 --> 00:14:52,863
Uh...

186
00:15:02,743 --> 00:15:06,579
I knew saving Brooklyn
was a bad idea.

187
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,186
Come on.

188
00:15:14,854 --> 00:15:16,293
Whoa.

189
00:15:18,132 --> 00:15:21,067
What is this place?

190
00:15:50,659 --> 00:15:53,990
Looks like nobody's
been down here for years.

191
00:15:55,827 --> 00:15:57,466
Luigi?

192
00:15:59,437 --> 00:16:01,602
Luigi, are you in there?

193
00:16:07,478 --> 00:16:09,610
Luigi!

194
00:16:11,713 --> 00:16:13,779
What?

195
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:35,273
Whoa.

196
00:16:43,644 --> 00:16:45,084
Luigi!

197
00:16:45,085 --> 00:16:47,483
Mario!

198
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,486
Give me your hand!

199
00:16:51,487 --> 00:16:53,158
It's all gonna be okay!

200
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:54,522
How is this gonna be okay?

201
00:16:54,523 --> 00:16:56,557
I'm telling you,
nothing can hurt us

202
00:16:56,558 --> 00:16:58,263
as long as we're together.

203
00:17:00,694 --> 00:17:03,235
Mario!

204
00:17:04,062 --> 00:17:06,865
Luigi!

205
00:17:42,903 --> 00:17:44,540
Do not touch that mushroom!
You'll die!

206
00:17:46,344 --> 00:17:49,104
Oh, I'm sorry.
That one's perfectly fine.

207
00:17:49,105 --> 00:17:50,644
That's a little mushroom man.

208
00:17:50,645 --> 00:17:52,481
A little mushroom man
talking to me.

209
00:17:52,482 --> 00:17:53,944
Pleased to meet you.

210
00:17:53,945 --> 00:17:55,847
I'm Toad.

211
00:17:55,848 --> 00:17:58,257
Uh, Mario.

212
00:18:00,492 --> 00:18:03,261
So this is, uh... this is...
this is not a dream?

213
00:18:03,262 --> 00:18:04,988
That hurt, right?

214
00:18:04,989 --> 00:18:07,298
- Yes!
- Definitely not a dream.

215
00:18:07,299 --> 00:18:09,861
Then it's... this place is...

216
00:18:09,862 --> 00:18:12,831
The Mushroom Kingdom!

217
00:18:12,832 --> 00:18:14,437
Mushrooms? Really?

218
00:18:14,438 --> 00:18:17,309
Now, that is
a cruel twist of fate.

219
00:18:22,173 --> 00:18:23,975
Hello.

220
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,482
Yeah, I'm actually looking
for somebody.

221
00:18:26,483 --> 00:18:27,978
Uh, my brother, in fact.

222
00:18:27,979 --> 00:18:31,014
He looks exactly like me
but tall and skinny and green.

223
00:18:31,015 --> 00:18:33,654
See, last time I saw him, he...
he was falling through a pipe.

224
00:18:33,655 --> 00:18:36,086
It was foggy, and...
and I believe there was lava.

225
00:18:37,329 --> 00:18:39,462
Uh, that is not good.

226
00:18:39,463 --> 00:18:41,596
Um, your brother

227
00:18:41,597 --> 00:18:44,126
has landed in the Dark Lands.

228
00:18:44,127 --> 00:18:45,303
They're under...

229
00:18:45,304 --> 00:18:47,239
Bowser's control.

230
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,669
Bowser?

231
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:52,641
He's the most evil,
wretched creature alive.

232
00:18:55,611 --> 00:18:57,414
I'm taking you
to see the princess.

233
00:18:57,415 --> 00:18:59,548
She can help you.

234
00:18:59,549 --> 00:19:01,143
She can do anything.

235
00:19:01,144 --> 00:19:03,146
Princess?

236
00:19:07,856 --> 00:19:09,327
Come on, Mario!

237
00:19:09,328 --> 00:19:11,428
Our big adventure begins now!

238
00:19:11,429 --> 00:19:13,057
Hang on, Luigi.

239
00:19:40,218 --> 00:19:43,493
Mario? Mario?

240
00:19:43,494 --> 00:19:45,330
Where are you?

241
00:19:45,331 --> 00:19:46,464
Huh?

242
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:26,437
Oh.

243
00:20:26,438 --> 00:20:29,165
Yes!

244
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:31,707
You just got a-Luigi'd.

245
00:21:48,555 --> 00:21:49,883
This way, Mario.

246
00:21:49,884 --> 00:21:52,887
The princess lives
right on that hill.

247
00:22:01,027 --> 00:22:02,863
Excuse me, everybody.
Coming through.

248
00:22:02,864 --> 00:22:04,799
Got a big adventure
happening right now.

249
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,064
Just clear a path for us.

250
00:22:06,065 --> 00:22:07,670
- If I could just...
- Here you go.

251
00:22:07,671 --> 00:22:08,968
Excuse me.

252
00:22:08,969 --> 00:22:11,135
Excuse me, everybody!
Coming through!

253
00:22:11,136 --> 00:22:14,677
This guy's brother is
going to die imminently!

254
00:22:14,678 --> 00:22:16,239
Out of the way, please!

255
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,779
Just trying to clear a path.
That's all I'm doing.

256
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:19,143
He's gonna be fine.

257
00:22:19,144 --> 00:22:20,375
- Chanterelle.
- Morning.

258
00:22:20,376 --> 00:22:22,081
Nice to see you, bud.

259
00:22:24,116 --> 00:22:25,490
Does this thing work?

260
00:22:25,491 --> 00:22:26,722
Yes, works great.

261
00:22:26,723 --> 00:22:28,890
You just have to blow into it.

262
00:22:29,728 --> 00:22:31,496
And up we go.

263
00:22:31,497 --> 00:22:33,323
Wait, up?

264
00:22:51,814 --> 00:22:55,784
Whoa. Okay, so these bricks
are just floating here? Uh...

265
00:22:55,785 --> 00:22:57,786
Just pop in this pipe,
and we're on our way.

266
00:22:57,787 --> 00:22:58,985
Oh.

267
00:22:58,986 --> 00:23:00,691
It's the only way to fly, man.

268
00:23:02,792 --> 00:23:05,388
Oh, wow.
Love these pi...

269
00:23:11,638 --> 00:23:12,802
Whoo!

270
00:23:19,074 --> 00:23:20,074
Huh?

271
00:23:26,345 --> 00:23:28,246
Oh, come on.

272
00:23:32,382 --> 00:23:34,251
Here we are. Palace doors.

273
00:23:34,252 --> 00:23:36,089
Bing, bang, boom.

274
00:23:37,829 --> 00:23:39,630
Come on!

275
00:23:39,631 --> 00:23:41,060
Whoo!

276
00:23:41,061 --> 00:23:43,063
Whoa.

277
00:23:47,804 --> 00:23:51,577
Pretty impressive, am I right?

278
00:23:54,472 --> 00:23:56,581
Hold it right there, you two.

279
00:23:56,582 --> 00:23:59,342
Oh, hey.
I need to see the princess.

280
00:23:59,343 --> 00:24:00,916
It's an emergency.

281
00:24:02,821 --> 00:24:04,017
What princess?

282
00:24:04,018 --> 00:24:06,052
I never heard of any princess.

283
00:24:06,053 --> 00:24:07,218
Oh, wait, I did.

284
00:24:07,219 --> 00:24:09,451
Our princess, though,
is in another castle.

285
00:24:09,452 --> 00:24:10,793
Oh, yeah. That's right.

286
00:24:10,794 --> 00:24:12,795
You should try
another castle, maybe.

287
00:24:12,796 --> 00:24:14,962
She ain't in this one.

288
00:24:14,963 --> 00:24:15,996
Huh?

289
00:24:15,997 --> 00:24:17,536
Okay, so they're
messing with you,

290
00:24:17,537 --> 00:24:19,539
and I don't like it.

291
00:24:23,204 --> 00:24:25,269
What do you guys, um...
What do you want to eat?

292
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:27,238
Anything...
anything your hearts desire.

293
00:24:27,239 --> 00:24:28,075
Go.

294
00:24:28,076 --> 00:24:30,715
I am ready to scramble it up.

295
00:24:38,217 --> 00:24:40,350
Hey! Intruder!

296
00:24:40,351 --> 00:24:41,659
Stop him!

297
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:43,254
Intruder!

298
00:24:43,255 --> 00:24:45,091
- Stop him!
- Stop him!

299
00:24:45,092 --> 00:24:47,292
Now! Stop him!

300
00:25:01,715 --> 00:25:03,714
Council, your attention.

301
00:25:03,715 --> 00:25:05,749
Bowser has found the Super Star

302
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:08,279
and is headed
toward our kingdom.

303
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:11,590
Its power will make him invincible.

304
00:25:11,591 --> 00:25:13,593
We will be destroyed.

305
00:25:15,518 --> 00:25:17,959
Princess, what are we gonna do?

306
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:21,062
I will not let him hurt you.

307
00:25:26,036 --> 00:25:29,168
We are going to stop Bowser.

308
00:25:29,169 --> 00:25:30,675
How? Look at us.

309
00:25:30,676 --> 00:25:32,237
We're adorable.

310
00:25:32,238 --> 00:25:36,439
I'm going to convince
the great Kong army to help us.

311
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:39,145
Together, we'll annihilate
that monster.

312
00:25:39,146 --> 00:25:41,818
Their mad king
doesn't make alliances.

313
00:25:41,819 --> 00:25:44,348
The Kongs will never agree.

314
00:25:44,349 --> 00:25:46,053
I can convince him.

315
00:25:46,054 --> 00:25:48,925
I'll leave for the
Jungle Kingdom in the morning.

316
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:53,666
Good luck, Princess,
for all our sakes.

317
00:26:02,105 --> 00:26:06,437
Princess!

318
00:26:10,718 --> 00:26:12,377
Princess. Hi...

319
00:26:14,852 --> 00:26:17,316
Wait. Release him.

320
00:26:19,155 --> 00:26:21,583
Whoa.

321
00:26:21,584 --> 00:26:23,729
Are you...

322
00:26:25,324 --> 00:26:26,621
He's a human!

323
00:26:26,622 --> 00:26:28,095
I mean, you are a human, right?

324
00:26:28,096 --> 00:26:29,965
It's just,
you're so small and...

325
00:26:29,966 --> 00:26:31,329
- Hey.
- Wait, wait, wait.

326
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:33,232
Let-let's go back.
Where did you come from?

327
00:26:33,233 --> 00:26:35,707
Uh, me and my little brother Luigi,

328
00:26:35,708 --> 00:26:37,269
we-we fell down this pipe.

329
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:40,239
And now he's lost s-somewhere
in the Dark Lands.

330
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,814
Then it's only a matter of time
until he's captured by Bowser.

331
00:26:43,815 --> 00:26:45,750
But you're in luck.

332
00:26:45,751 --> 00:26:47,510
I'm on my way to stop him.

333
00:26:47,511 --> 00:26:48,786
Well, take me with you.

334
00:26:48,787 --> 00:26:51,855
This guy's a lunatic, a psycho.

335
00:26:51,856 --> 00:26:54,759
He will eat you for breakfast.

336
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,222
He won't even notice it, probably,

337
00:26:56,223 --> 00:26:59,060
'cause you're very, very small.

338
00:26:59,061 --> 00:27:00,963
You know what?
Make fun of me all you want,

339
00:27:00,964 --> 00:27:03,131
but you are gonna help me
find my brother.

340
00:27:04,332 --> 00:27:06,002
Please?

341
00:27:07,302 --> 00:27:08,366
Well, okay.

342
00:27:08,367 --> 00:27:10,468
Let's see what you're made of.

343
00:27:11,537 --> 00:27:13,107
Is that a yes?

344
00:27:13,108 --> 00:27:16,177
No, that's a "let's see
what you're made of."

345
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:07,898
If you can finish this,
you're coming with me.

346
00:28:07,899 --> 00:28:09,428
Watch and learn.

347
00:28:34,717 --> 00:28:36,290
Hi-yah!

348
00:28:52,638 --> 00:28:54,307
That was amazing.

349
00:28:54,308 --> 00:28:56,914
Wait. How-how am I
supposed to do that?

350
00:28:56,915 --> 00:28:58,344
With the Power-Ups.

351
00:28:58,345 --> 00:29:01,084
They give us special abilities.

352
00:29:03,319 --> 00:29:05,054
Ugh. Really?

353
00:29:05,055 --> 00:29:06,925
Go on. Eat it.

354
00:29:11,723 --> 00:29:13,161
Now, this has to be a mushroom?

355
00:29:13,162 --> 00:29:15,658
'Cause I just hate
mushrooms and...

356
00:29:15,659 --> 00:29:17,100
Okay, okay.

357
00:29:18,398 --> 00:29:20,663
Are you sure
there's not, like, a...

358
00:29:20,664 --> 00:29:21,873
- Down the hatch.
- Ow.

359
00:29:21,874 --> 00:29:23,634
Yep, there it is, and all gone.

360
00:29:25,042 --> 00:29:27,373
Oh, not cool.

361
00:29:27,374 --> 00:29:28,804
Uh...

362
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:32,379
Huh?

363
00:29:41,588 --> 00:29:42,960
Whoa-oh-oh!

364
00:29:42,961 --> 00:29:45,260
- I'm tall.
- And strong.

365
00:29:47,825 --> 00:29:49,296
And you can jump.

366
00:29:49,297 --> 00:29:51,331
Oh, I got this.

367
00:29:51,332 --> 00:29:53,070
No problem.

368
00:29:54,733 --> 00:29:56,205
Woo-hoo!

369
00:30:04,081 --> 00:30:06,313
Oh, yeah.

370
00:30:06,314 --> 00:30:09,614
When you get hit,
you lose the power.

371
00:30:11,123 --> 00:30:13,519
Great.

372
00:30:15,655 --> 00:30:17,424
Come on. Try again.

373
00:30:20,229 --> 00:30:22,330
Ooh.

374
00:30:33,011 --> 00:30:35,078
Yes!

375
00:31:30,233 --> 00:31:34,500
Well, we have a long journey
ahead of us, Mustache.

376
00:31:34,501 --> 00:31:37,107
- But I didn't make it.
- You almost did.

377
00:31:37,108 --> 00:31:39,142
No one gets it right away.

378
00:31:39,143 --> 00:31:40,902
How many tries did it take you?

379
00:31:40,903 --> 00:31:43,344
Oh, so many.

380
00:31:43,345 --> 00:31:45,214
I was not good at it.

381
00:31:45,215 --> 00:31:46,941
Worse than you.

382
00:31:46,942 --> 00:31:48,448
You got it right away,
didn't you?

383
00:31:48,449 --> 00:31:50,714
I got it right away,
but I grew up here.

384
00:31:50,715 --> 00:31:53,519
Okay, now you're just trying
to make me feel better.

385
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:56,127
No. No.

386
00:31:57,064 --> 00:32:00,032
- Is it working?
- A little bit. Yeah.

387
00:32:29,954 --> 00:32:31,359
My army!

388
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,295
- Koopas.
- Yeah!

389
00:32:33,296 --> 00:32:34,725
Goombas.

390
00:32:34,726 --> 00:32:36,859
Whatever those things are.

391
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:39,697
After years of searching
for the Super Star,

392
00:32:39,698 --> 00:32:42,205
it is finally ours!
Yeah!

393
00:32:42,206 --> 00:32:45,703
I am now the most powerful
turtle in the world!

394
00:32:45,704 --> 00:32:47,144
Yeah!

395
00:32:47,145 --> 00:32:49,938
Soon, we will arrive
at the Mushroom Kingdom.

396
00:32:49,939 --> 00:32:51,247
Yeah!

397
00:32:51,248 --> 00:32:53,678
Where, after years
of being sworn enemies,

398
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:56,186
I will ask their princess
to marry me

399
00:32:56,187 --> 00:32:58,221
in a fairy-tale wedding!

400
00:32:58,222 --> 00:32:59,816
Yeah!

401
00:32:59,817 --> 00:33:01,290
Eh?

402
00:33:01,291 --> 00:33:03,193
Yeah.

403
00:33:03,194 --> 00:33:05,228
Did he say marry their princess?

404
00:33:05,229 --> 00:33:06,922
Doesn't she hate you?

405
00:33:06,923 --> 00:33:09,133
Of course she hates me.

406
00:33:09,134 --> 00:33:11,795
But that makes me love her
all the more.

407
00:33:11,796 --> 00:33:13,962
Her heart-shaped bangs,

408
00:33:13,963 --> 00:33:16,338
the way she floats
in the breeze,

409
00:33:16,339 --> 00:33:18,571
her immovable tiara.

410
00:33:18,572 --> 00:33:20,573
And when she sees this star...

411
00:33:20,574 --> 00:33:23,807
oh, wedding bells.

412
00:33:23,808 --> 00:33:26,349
Well, what if she says no?

413
00:33:28,353 --> 00:33:30,121
Then I will power up
with this star

414
00:33:30,122 --> 00:33:31,947
and destroy
the Mushroom Kingdom!

415
00:33:31,948 --> 00:33:33,388
Yeah!

416
00:33:33,389 --> 00:33:36,094
Prepare yourselves
for the best wedding ever.

417
00:33:36,095 --> 00:33:38,757
It's gonna rock!

418
00:34:48,334 --> 00:34:50,663
They're all counting on us.

419
00:34:50,664 --> 00:34:52,270
No pressure.

420
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:57,209
Huh?

421
00:35:03,844 --> 00:35:08,417
My Toads, our days of terror
are almost over.

422
00:35:08,418 --> 00:35:11,519
With the help of the Kong army,
we will stop...

423
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:14,358
Uh, who's he?

424
00:35:16,956 --> 00:35:19,264
He's not important!

425
00:35:35,711 --> 00:35:36,808
Nervous?

426
00:35:36,809 --> 00:35:38,315
Who? Me?

427
00:35:38,316 --> 00:35:40,108
Yes, a little.

428
00:35:40,109 --> 00:35:42,748
♪ We're going on an adventure! ♪

429
00:35:42,749 --> 00:35:44,080
Come on, guys!

430
00:35:46,423 --> 00:35:48,182
Hey, Mario.

431
00:35:48,183 --> 00:35:49,392
You know this guy?

432
00:35:49,393 --> 00:35:50,954
- Uh...
- We're best friends.

433
00:35:50,955 --> 00:35:52,791
But are we?

434
00:35:52,792 --> 00:35:54,056
Don't worry.

435
00:35:54,057 --> 00:35:57,191
I will protect you.

436
00:35:57,192 --> 00:36:00,502
A Toad brave enough to join me.

437
00:36:00,503 --> 00:36:02,372
I fear nothing.

438
00:36:02,373 --> 00:36:04,066
Well, that settles it.

439
00:36:04,067 --> 00:36:05,474
You're coming with us.

440
00:36:05,475 --> 00:36:06,871
Let's move.

441
00:36:06,872 --> 00:36:09,643
I said we're going on
an adventure!

442
00:36:09,644 --> 00:36:11,349
Whoo!

443
00:36:41,381 --> 00:36:43,380
Pretty incredible, huh?

444
00:36:43,381 --> 00:36:45,613
Mamma mia.

445
00:36:45,614 --> 00:36:49,046
I'll never let anyone ruin this.

446
00:37:36,863 --> 00:37:39,733
Sire.

447
00:37:39,734 --> 00:37:40,899
What?

448
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:43,770
A report from our intelligence.

449
00:37:43,771 --> 00:37:47,808
A mustachioed human has arrived
in the Mushroom Kingdom.

450
00:37:49,348 --> 00:37:51,481
The princess has been
training him.

451
00:37:51,482 --> 00:37:53,913
They are up to something, sire.

452
00:37:56,313 --> 00:37:57,785
Sit.

453
00:37:58,887 --> 00:38:00,359
Jam with me.

454
00:38:03,694 --> 00:38:07,563
This, uh, human,
where did he come from?

455
00:38:07,564 --> 00:38:10,368
We... aren't sure.

456
00:38:10,369 --> 00:38:12,469
Does the princess like him?

457
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:15,604
Oh, sire. Look in the mirror.

458
00:38:15,605 --> 00:38:17,969
You have nothing to worry about.

459
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:21,006
I know that. I'm not threatened.

460
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:27,110
Find out who he is
and what they're planning!

461
00:38:27,111 --> 00:38:29,618
I'm on it, sire.

462
00:38:29,619 --> 00:38:31,785
May I lift the cover?

463
00:38:31,786 --> 00:38:32,885
Not yet.

464
00:38:32,886 --> 00:38:35,427
Pain is the best teacher.

465
00:38:45,769 --> 00:38:47,130
Thinking about your brother?

466
00:38:47,131 --> 00:38:49,737
We've never been apart
this long.

467
00:38:49,738 --> 00:38:52,675
Don't worry.
We're going to save him.

468
00:39:08,726 --> 00:39:11,429
You don't seem like
you're from here.

469
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:14,190
I don't know where I'm from.

470
00:39:14,191 --> 00:39:15,224
Really?

471
00:39:15,225 --> 00:39:16,566
Yep.

472
00:39:16,567 --> 00:39:19,669
My earliest memory is arriving.

473
00:39:26,546 --> 00:39:28,644
<i>I was so lucky they found me.</i>

474
00:39:28,645 --> 00:39:30,581
<i>They took me in.</i>

475
00:39:32,308 --> 00:39:34,485
<i>Raised me like one of their own.</i>

476
00:39:34,486 --> 00:39:36,521
<i>And when I was ready...</i>

477
00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:41,086
<i>they made me their princess.</i>

478
00:39:45,565 --> 00:39:47,257
Hey, maybe you're from my world.

479
00:39:48,898 --> 00:39:51,733
There's a huge universe
out there

480
00:39:51,734 --> 00:39:54,605
with a lot of galaxies.

481
00:40:37,912 --> 00:40:40,552
We found him in the Dark Lands.

482
00:40:45,656 --> 00:40:47,284
Leave him to me.

483
00:40:56,766 --> 00:40:58,261
What is your name?

484
00:40:58,262 --> 00:41:00,495
Uh, Luigi.

485
00:41:01,804 --> 00:41:03,497
Not sure if you know who I am,

486
00:41:03,498 --> 00:41:07,139
but I'm about to marry
a princess and rule the world.

487
00:41:07,977 --> 00:41:09,503
Wow, uh...

488
00:41:09,504 --> 00:41:10,812
Yay.

489
00:41:10,813 --> 00:41:14,684
But there's one problem, Luigi.

490
00:41:14,685 --> 00:41:17,819
There's a human
traveling with my fiancée.

491
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:20,822
Has a mustache, just like you.

492
00:41:20,823 --> 00:41:22,725
Do you know him?

493
00:41:22,726 --> 00:41:24,760
No. No.

494
00:41:24,761 --> 00:41:27,026
Ah, a tough one, I see.

495
00:41:27,027 --> 00:41:28,633
Maybe this will get you to talk.

496
00:41:29,667 --> 00:41:30,832
Do you think I know

497
00:41:30,833 --> 00:41:31,932
every human being
with a mustache

498
00:41:31,933 --> 00:41:33,362
wearing an identical outfit

499
00:41:33,363 --> 00:41:35,771
with a hat with the letter
of his first name on it?

500
00:41:35,772 --> 00:41:37,367
Because I don't.

501
00:41:38,907 --> 00:41:40,809
- Do you know him?!
- Stop!

502
00:41:40,810 --> 00:41:42,745
Stop, stop, stop, stop.
I know him.

503
00:41:42,746 --> 00:41:44,945
Yes, I know him.
Yeah, he's my brother Mario,

504
00:41:44,946 --> 00:41:47,585
and he's the best guy
in the world.

505
00:41:47,586 --> 00:41:50,049
Do princesses
find him attractive?

506
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:52,789
They do if they have good taste!

507
00:41:54,692 --> 00:41:56,121
Get him out of my sight!

508
00:41:56,122 --> 00:41:58,255
We'll see how tough
this Mario is

509
00:41:58,256 --> 00:42:00,830
when he watches me
kill his brother!

510
00:42:13,304 --> 00:42:15,339
Where am I?

511
00:42:19,312 --> 00:42:20,574
Home.

512
00:42:20,575 --> 00:42:23,017
Pay him no heed.

513
00:42:23,789 --> 00:42:26,580
He is cute, but he is...

514
00:42:26,581 --> 00:42:30,794
In an insane world, it is
the sane who is called crazy.

515
00:42:35,526 --> 00:42:37,129
How long you guys been in here?

516
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:41,034
Time, like hope, is an illusion.

517
00:42:41,035 --> 00:42:42,937
Please!
We are depressed enough!

518
00:42:42,938 --> 00:42:45,742
There's got to be
a way out of here.

519
00:42:45,743 --> 00:42:47,106
There is no escape.

520
00:42:47,107 --> 00:42:50,407
The only hope is
the sweet relief of death.

521
00:42:52,112 --> 00:42:54,477
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

522
00:43:18,338 --> 00:43:19,567
You ready?

523
00:43:19,568 --> 00:43:21,372
Eh... sure.

524
00:43:29,578 --> 00:43:31,788
What?

525
00:43:31,789 --> 00:43:33,955
How you doing?

526
00:43:33,956 --> 00:43:36,728
We are here to see the king.

527
00:43:39,258 --> 00:43:41,161
Follow me.

528
00:43:42,032 --> 00:43:43,525
That gorilla's wearing
a sports coat.

529
00:43:43,526 --> 00:43:44,835
Feel underdressed.

530
00:43:50,236 --> 00:43:51,743
Hop in.

531
00:45:02,508 --> 00:45:06,279
Oh, by all means, come in.

532
00:45:17,787 --> 00:45:20,963
Great and mighty Cranky Kong...

533
00:45:20,964 --> 00:45:23,163
So, I heard you want my army.

534
00:45:23,164 --> 00:45:25,726
Yes, Your Highness.

535
00:45:25,727 --> 00:45:27,134
Without your help,

536
00:45:27,135 --> 00:45:29,467
the Mushroom Kingdom
will be annihilated.

537
00:45:30,602 --> 00:45:35,175
What makes you think you're
worthy of fighting alongside

538
00:45:35,176 --> 00:45:40,180
the greatest army in the world?

539
00:45:40,181 --> 00:45:42,050
Because we have heart.

540
00:45:42,051 --> 00:45:45,647
And with your strength,
we can win.

541
00:45:45,648 --> 00:45:47,286
Okay, fine.

542
00:45:47,287 --> 00:45:49,651
- That's it?
- No, that's not it.

543
00:45:49,652 --> 00:45:52,258
The answer is no. Goodbye.

544
00:45:52,259 --> 00:45:56,031
If the Mushroom Kingdom falls,
the Jungle Kingdom is next.

545
00:45:56,032 --> 00:45:59,904
We're not leaving
without your army.

546
00:46:02,698 --> 00:46:04,138
Who is this guy?

547
00:46:04,139 --> 00:46:06,372
Oh, he makes me laugh.

548
00:46:07,703 --> 00:46:09,308
All right, tough guy.

549
00:46:09,309 --> 00:46:14,082
You want my army so badly,
defeat my son

550
00:46:14,083 --> 00:46:18,549
in the Great Ring of Kong!

551
00:46:19,222 --> 00:46:20,517
Give us a second.

552
00:46:20,518 --> 00:46:23,355
This is
a really, really bad idea.

553
00:46:23,356 --> 00:46:25,863
Well, do you have another way
to save my brother?

554
00:46:25,864 --> 00:46:27,964
Are you two done whispering?

555
00:46:27,965 --> 00:46:30,066
It's a little rude.

556
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:33,937
You, sir, have a deal.

557
00:46:33,938 --> 00:46:36,632
I'll fight your son and win.

558
00:46:36,633 --> 00:46:38,569
I'm sure you will.

559
00:47:28,190 --> 00:47:30,521
I am DK.

560
00:47:30,522 --> 00:47:31,995
I'm Donkey Kong.

561
00:47:31,996 --> 00:47:33,623
Yeah! We love you!

562
00:47:33,624 --> 00:47:34,855
Oh, yeah.

563
00:47:34,856 --> 00:47:36,164
Hi, Dad.

564
00:47:36,165 --> 00:47:37,726
- Hi.
- No, no.

565
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:39,002
Don't do that.

566
00:47:39,003 --> 00:47:40,333
Dad, wave back.

567
00:47:40,334 --> 00:47:42,203
Enough with the showboating.

568
00:47:42,204 --> 00:47:44,304
What do you mean? They like it.

569
00:47:44,305 --> 00:47:46,240
It's what they came here for.

570
00:47:46,241 --> 00:47:48,704
Dancing pecs.

571
00:47:48,705 --> 00:47:50,607
Okay, simmer down.

572
00:47:51,609 --> 00:47:53,280
I said simmer down!

573
00:47:53,281 --> 00:47:56,118
DK! DK! DK!
That means you, Diddy Kong.

574
00:47:56,119 --> 00:47:58,054
D... Sorry.

575
00:47:58,055 --> 00:48:03,290
Now, since I want this fight
to last more than five seconds,

576
00:48:03,291 --> 00:48:06,689
I put Power-Ups
around the arena.

577
00:48:06,690 --> 00:48:08,130
You're welcome, Mario.

578
00:48:08,131 --> 00:48:10,924
I don't need anything special
to break

579
00:48:10,925 --> 00:48:14,005
every bone in your tiny body!

580
00:48:21,672 --> 00:48:22,871
All right.

581
00:48:35,224 --> 00:48:37,126
- Oh!
- Oh, my... Okay.

582
00:48:37,127 --> 00:48:39,492
Guess you're not
getting my army.

583
00:48:44,365 --> 00:48:46,861
Is this what you came for?

584
00:48:46,862 --> 00:48:48,864
We love you, DK!

585
00:48:51,438 --> 00:48:53,605
Hi, Dad! Love you!

586
00:48:57,842 --> 00:49:01,085
It is on like Donkey Kong!

587
00:49:07,786 --> 00:49:11,491
You're about to pick on
someone your own size.

588
00:49:16,498 --> 00:49:17,827
Yeah...

589
00:49:23,868 --> 00:49:25,306
Oh...

590
00:49:25,307 --> 00:49:27,969
I guess he got
the wrong mushroom.

591
00:49:38,518 --> 00:49:39,981
Oh!

592
00:49:50,169 --> 00:49:51,465
Get up, Mario!

593
00:50:18,659 --> 00:50:19,987
Had enough?

594
00:50:19,988 --> 00:50:23,134
Not even close.

595
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:36,476
Mario!

596
00:50:36,477 --> 00:50:39,545
It's-a me.

597
00:50:39,546 --> 00:50:42,681
The box!

598
00:50:57,828 --> 00:50:59,268
Aw!

599
00:50:59,269 --> 00:51:01,369
He looks adorable.

600
00:51:01,370 --> 00:51:02,997
He really does.

601
00:51:02,998 --> 00:51:05,000
Oh, what? I'm a cat?

602
00:51:06,342 --> 00:51:09,278
You got the cat box! Oh, my...

603
00:51:09,279 --> 00:51:12,248
Oh! Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

604
00:51:12,249 --> 00:51:14,416
Okay. Now you die.

605
00:51:15,813 --> 00:51:18,915
Huh. I'm a cat.

606
00:51:25,891 --> 00:51:28,298
Meow.

607
00:52:00,198 --> 00:52:01,858
Had enough?

608
00:52:01,859 --> 00:52:04,630
Not even...

609
00:52:04,631 --> 00:52:06,061
close.

610
00:52:07,601 --> 00:52:10,274
I'll take that as a yes.

611
00:52:15,070 --> 00:52:17,544
CROWD
Mario! Mario!

612
00:52:17,545 --> 00:52:20,173
- Yes! That's my best friend!
- Mario! Mario!

613
00:52:20,174 --> 00:52:24,045
Mario! Mario! Mario!

614
00:52:24,046 --> 00:52:26,553
Yeah, yeah.

615
00:52:26,554 --> 00:52:28,687
CROWD
Mario! Mario!

616
00:52:28,688 --> 00:52:32,086
That was incredible.

617
00:52:32,087 --> 00:52:33,560
He kept beating you senseless...

618
00:52:33,561 --> 00:52:34,561
Hey.

619
00:52:34,562 --> 00:52:36,563
And you just kept
getting back up?

620
00:52:36,564 --> 00:52:38,191
You just don't know
when to quit.

621
00:52:38,192 --> 00:52:39,533
Huh.

622
00:52:39,534 --> 00:52:41,271
Well, never thought of that
as a good thing.

623
00:52:41,272 --> 00:52:43,196
It's a great thing.

624
00:52:43,197 --> 00:52:45,165
Thanks. I...

625
00:52:45,166 --> 00:52:47,200
I let him win,
just for the record.

626
00:52:47,201 --> 00:52:49,477
Really, though?
Why would you do that?

627
00:52:49,478 --> 00:52:51,006
You want to know why? It's...

628
00:52:51,007 --> 00:52:53,514
Mind your own business!
That's why!

629
00:52:53,515 --> 00:52:55,208
All right, giant monkey.

630
00:52:55,209 --> 00:52:58,322
Enough! Get inside.

631
00:52:59,754 --> 00:53:01,918
We've located Bowser's ship.

632
00:53:01,919 --> 00:53:06,428
He's gonna arrive at the
Mushroom Kingdom by sundown.

633
00:53:06,429 --> 00:53:10,190
Lucky for you guys,
I got a shortcut.

634
00:53:10,191 --> 00:53:12,830
We beat him there
and ambush him.

635
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:15,063
Yeah, I know.

636
00:53:15,064 --> 00:53:19,277
That's why
we're gonna need karts.

637
00:53:36,527 --> 00:53:39,021
Well, what are you waiting for?

638
00:53:39,022 --> 00:53:41,365
Pick your karts.

639
00:54:41,427 --> 00:54:43,459
I hate you.

640
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:44,790
To the Mushroom Kingdom

641
00:54:44,791 --> 00:54:47,320
and the biggest fight
of our lives.

642
00:54:47,321 --> 00:54:49,367
Here we go!

643
00:54:51,963 --> 00:54:54,064
Yeah!

644
00:55:07,552 --> 00:55:10,212
Princess Peach, here we are.

645
00:55:11,719 --> 00:55:14,557
I guess love really makes a guy
come out of his shell.

646
00:55:18,957 --> 00:55:23,466
Let's rule the world
together forever.

647
00:55:23,467 --> 00:55:25,567
Will you marry me?

648
00:55:25,568 --> 00:55:27,471
Oh, yes!

649
00:55:28,298 --> 00:55:30,330
What?!

650
00:55:30,331 --> 00:55:33,674
We have found the princess
and the mustachioed human.

651
00:55:33,675 --> 00:55:37,909
He has defeated Donkey Kong
and won the Kong army.

652
00:55:37,910 --> 00:55:40,241
So, like,
Peach was super impressed?

653
00:55:40,242 --> 00:55:41,913
It appears so, yes.

654
00:55:41,914 --> 00:55:44,179
They are heading toward
their secret passage.

655
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:46,885
Oh, they think
they can surprise me, huh?

656
00:55:46,886 --> 00:55:49,460
Two can play at that game.

657
00:56:10,879 --> 00:56:15,111
Um, no one panic,
but the road is about to end.

658
00:56:15,112 --> 00:56:18,984
Well, then you better
step on the gas and buckle up!

659
00:56:48,277 --> 00:56:50,048
Woo-hoo!

660
00:56:50,886 --> 00:56:53,413
Is there anything like this
in your world?

661
00:56:53,414 --> 00:56:54,656
What?

662
00:56:54,657 --> 00:56:56,449
Is there anything like this

663
00:56:56,450 --> 00:56:58,418
in your world?

664
00:56:58,419 --> 00:56:59,826
No.

665
00:56:59,827 --> 00:57:01,762
We don't drive on rainbows.

666
00:57:01,763 --> 00:57:03,456
What are you gonna tell me next?

667
00:57:03,457 --> 00:57:05,667
That the turtles aren't evil?

668
00:57:05,668 --> 00:57:07,933
No, no. They're usually pets.

669
00:57:07,934 --> 00:57:09,132
No way.

670
00:57:09,133 --> 00:57:11,168
Ah, come to Brooklyn.
I'll buy you a turtle.

671
00:57:12,510 --> 00:57:13,939
Maybe I will.

672
00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:16,238
Dude, is this you flirting?

673
00:57:16,239 --> 00:57:17,712
This is painful.

674
00:57:17,713 --> 00:57:19,406
Just... I was trying to be nice.

675
00:57:19,407 --> 00:57:20,682
You are so embarrassing.

676
00:57:20,683 --> 00:57:22,519
A princess would never
go out with you.

677
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:25,049
Yes, she would.
I guarantee she would.

678
00:57:25,050 --> 00:57:27,150
Guys, enough.

679
00:57:27,151 --> 00:57:29,120
All right, all right.

680
00:57:37,636 --> 00:57:39,702
Attack!

681
00:57:48,469 --> 00:57:50,075
It's an ambush!

682
00:57:52,913 --> 00:57:55,179
Defensive positions!

683
00:58:10,735 --> 00:58:12,702
Mario, you're a dead man.

684
00:58:16,202 --> 00:58:18,235
Split up!

685
00:58:20,437 --> 00:58:22,107
Mario!

686
00:58:43,702 --> 00:58:45,702
Whoa!

687
00:58:47,264 --> 00:58:49,002
Whoa.

688
00:59:38,381 --> 00:59:40,922
I'm too cute to die!

689
00:59:49,898 --> 00:59:52,868
That is how you princess!

690
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:06,508
Time to die, Mario.

691
01:00:23,659 --> 01:00:24,834
Ow!

692
01:00:27,432 --> 01:00:29,563
See ya!

693
01:00:29,564 --> 01:00:31,005
No!

694
01:00:34,472 --> 01:00:36,570
Woo-hoo!

695
01:00:36,571 --> 01:00:38,342
Yeah!

696
01:00:44,579 --> 01:00:47,790
You can't escape me.

697
01:00:47,791 --> 01:00:48,890
What?

698
01:00:48,891 --> 01:00:51,861
Blue shell!

699
01:01:06,172 --> 01:01:08,173
No!

700
01:01:08,174 --> 01:01:09,978
No, Mario.

701
01:01:11,540 --> 01:01:13,607
Aah! No.

702
01:01:13,608 --> 01:01:14,751
No!

703
01:01:14,752 --> 01:01:16,886
Whoa!

704
01:01:19,682 --> 01:01:22,859
Get your clown claws off of me!

705
01:01:25,653 --> 01:01:27,764
Goodbye, Mario.

706
01:01:27,765 --> 01:01:30,196
We have to get home.

707
01:01:36,730 --> 01:01:39,567
Hey, this is your fault!

708
01:01:39,568 --> 01:01:41,569
- My fault? You're the one who...
- Stop talking!

709
01:01:41,570 --> 01:01:44,781
I don't want the last thing
I hear before I die

710
01:01:44,782 --> 01:01:46,378
to be your...

711
01:02:16,112 --> 01:02:19,079
Mario, you saved my life.

712
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:21,246
Yeah, well, I won't tell anyone.

713
01:02:21,247 --> 01:02:22,819
Good. Please don't.

714
01:02:22,820 --> 01:02:24,052
Okay.

715
01:02:25,779 --> 01:02:29,255
Uh, did you just feel something?

716
01:02:31,620 --> 01:02:33,061
Swim!

717
01:02:49,574 --> 01:02:51,078
Bowser's on his way.

718
01:02:51,079 --> 01:02:52,883
You have to evacuate.

719
01:02:54,775 --> 01:02:58,449
Hurry. Get out of the city!

720
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,462
Princess?

721
01:03:12,463 --> 01:03:14,167
We lost the army.

722
01:03:14,168 --> 01:03:16,665
And Mario's gone.

723
01:03:17,875 --> 01:03:20,371
Bowser is coming.

724
01:03:20,372 --> 01:03:23,176
Head into the forest.
I'll buy you some time.

725
01:03:23,177 --> 01:03:25,575
You heard her.
Evacuate the city.

726
01:03:27,049 --> 01:03:29,083
Go with the others.

727
01:03:29,084 --> 01:03:31,988
I said I wouldn't let
anyone hurt you.

728
01:03:36,456 --> 01:03:37,456
Run!

729
01:03:41,791 --> 01:03:43,934
Just leave it. There's no time.

730
01:04:38,914 --> 01:04:40,847
Princess Peach.

731
01:04:40,848 --> 01:04:43,059
Brave as ever.

732
01:04:44,997 --> 01:04:49,031
As you can see,
I have the Super Star.

733
01:04:49,032 --> 01:04:53,399
If you're going to use it,
use it now.

734
01:04:55,896 --> 01:04:57,369
No, Princess.

735
01:04:57,370 --> 01:04:59,767
I stole this star for us.

736
01:04:59,768 --> 01:05:03,442
I guess love really makes a guy
come out of his shell.

737
01:05:06,744 --> 01:05:08,809
I told you that line
wouldn't work.

738
01:05:08,810 --> 01:05:10,580
You're doing great.

739
01:05:10,581 --> 01:05:15,255
Peaches, with this star,
we will be invincible.

740
01:05:15,256 --> 01:05:19,787
We can rule the world
together forever.

741
01:05:19,788 --> 01:05:21,690
Will you marry me?

742
01:05:21,691 --> 01:05:23,197
Marry you?

743
01:05:23,198 --> 01:05:24,858
Are you insane?

744
01:05:24,859 --> 01:05:26,959
I would never marry you.

745
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:30,799
Maybe you should reconsider.

746
01:05:32,603 --> 01:05:33,801
No!

747
01:05:33,802 --> 01:05:35,177
Stop!

748
01:05:37,014 --> 01:05:38,245
Please stop.

749
01:05:38,246 --> 01:05:39,411
I'll... I'll-I'll marry you.

750
01:05:39,412 --> 01:05:41,315
Just don't hurt my Toads.

751
01:05:46,122 --> 01:05:48,157
You have my word.

752
01:05:55,232 --> 01:05:57,958
Time for a wedding!

753
01:06:25,326 --> 01:06:28,427
Ooh, fresh meat for the grinder.

754
01:06:28,428 --> 01:06:31,067
Who's this ray of sunshine?

755
01:06:31,068 --> 01:06:34,136
There's no sunshine,
only darkness.

756
01:06:34,137 --> 01:06:36,171
Shut up, shut up, shut up!

757
01:06:36,172 --> 01:06:38,437
Hello, prisoners.

758
01:06:38,438 --> 01:06:40,274
You don't deserve this,

759
01:06:40,275 --> 01:06:43,475
but you're invited
to the royal wedding!

760
01:06:43,476 --> 01:06:45,279
Yay!

761
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:49,350
Where you will all be
ritualistically sacrificed!

762
01:06:51,748 --> 01:06:53,650
Oh, no, no, no.

763
01:06:53,651 --> 01:06:56,049
Finally, mercy.

764
01:06:57,457 --> 01:06:59,558
Mario.

765
01:07:11,869 --> 01:07:13,208
So this is the end.

766
01:07:13,209 --> 01:07:14,902
Being slowly digested by an eel,

767
01:07:14,903 --> 01:07:17,113
next to an idiot in overalls.

768
01:07:17,114 --> 01:07:20,116
Well, at least your brother
isn't gonna die because of you.

769
01:07:20,117 --> 01:07:21,381
At least you're not gonna die

770
01:07:21,382 --> 01:07:22,745
with your dad thinking
you're a joke.

771
01:07:22,746 --> 01:07:25,847
Yeah, well, my dad thinks
I'm a joke, too.

772
01:07:25,848 --> 01:07:27,849
Yeah? Well...

773
01:07:27,850 --> 01:07:28,982
your dad's right!

774
01:07:28,983 --> 01:07:30,390
You know what?
I feel bad enough.

775
01:07:30,391 --> 01:07:31,853
Just-just leave me alone.

776
01:07:31,854 --> 01:07:34,427
I've never met your dad,
but he sounds brilliant.

777
01:07:34,428 --> 01:07:37,827
Just go in a corner and smash
some stuff, smash monkey!

778
01:07:38,993 --> 01:07:43,095
I am more than a guy

779
01:07:43,096 --> 01:07:45,142
who smashes things!

780
01:08:12,763 --> 01:08:16,239
- That was amazing!
- Now we're even!

781
01:08:45,202 --> 01:08:47,060
Princess, I got it.

782
01:08:47,061 --> 01:08:48,666
Great job.

783
01:08:48,667 --> 01:08:51,130
Couldn't have you going
out there without your bouquet.

784
01:08:51,131 --> 01:08:52,572
It's perfect.

785
01:09:19,502 --> 01:09:22,338
I'll be sacrificing them
in your honor.

786
01:09:23,308 --> 01:09:25,132
Lower the prisoners!

787
01:09:32,449 --> 01:09:34,448
Dearly belov...

788
01:09:34,449 --> 01:09:36,318
Huh?

789
01:09:36,319 --> 01:09:38,518
Drama.

790
01:09:38,519 --> 01:09:41,114
You really thought
I'd marry you?

791
01:09:41,115 --> 01:09:43,017
Kinda.

792
01:09:43,018 --> 01:09:45,658
I'd never marry a monster.

793
01:09:46,694 --> 01:09:49,695
Then we are breaking up
right now!

794
01:10:15,052 --> 01:10:16,656
They got to be up there.

795
01:10:19,254 --> 01:10:21,056
Fire!

796
01:10:28,703 --> 01:10:31,770
- You want to do this?
- Yes, I do.

797
01:10:41,045 --> 01:10:42,649
Yes! Fire!

798
01:10:57,259 --> 01:10:59,434
Woo-hoo!

799
01:10:59,435 --> 01:11:01,635
This is fun!

800
01:11:02,330 --> 01:11:03,868
Ha! Loser!

801
01:11:07,808 --> 01:11:10,071
Hey, what does this do?

802
01:11:10,072 --> 01:11:12,205
Whoa!

803
01:11:12,206 --> 01:11:14,416
Whoa. Yeah.

804
01:11:14,417 --> 01:11:17,651
Whoa.

805
01:11:19,149 --> 01:11:20,488
Cool raccoon suit.

806
01:11:20,489 --> 01:11:22,788
- Really?
- Not at all.

807
01:11:55,152 --> 01:11:57,086
Whee!

808
01:12:01,761 --> 01:12:04,159
Huh?

809
01:12:10,035 --> 01:12:11,066
Whew.

810
01:12:11,067 --> 01:12:12,475
Boo.

811
01:12:22,245 --> 01:12:24,487
Huh?

812
01:12:25,083 --> 01:12:27,347
- Lu!
- Mario?

813
01:12:29,890 --> 01:12:31,889
I told you. See?

814
01:12:31,890 --> 01:12:35,927
As long as we're together,
everything is gonna be okay.

815
01:12:38,798 --> 01:12:41,262
Mario, why do you look
like a bear? What is this?

816
01:12:45,301 --> 01:12:46,838
You did good, kid.

817
01:12:46,839 --> 01:12:49,676
Make your pecs dance.
You deserve it.

818
01:12:49,677 --> 01:12:52,515
No time now. Definitely later.

819
01:13:05,189 --> 01:13:06,495
Launch the Bomber Bill

820
01:13:06,496 --> 01:13:09,928
and destroy
the Mushroom Kingdom!

821
01:13:20,908 --> 01:13:22,875
No.

822
01:13:29,620 --> 01:13:32,115
Hey, hey. Hey, over here.

823
01:13:42,831 --> 01:13:45,095
You asked for it.

824
01:13:53,171 --> 01:13:54,808
Hello.

825
01:14:14,597 --> 01:14:16,896
Ow!

826
01:14:18,636 --> 01:14:20,163
Really?

827
01:14:25,005 --> 01:14:27,038
Follow me.

828
01:14:31,374 --> 01:14:33,583
Come on.

829
01:14:34,784 --> 01:14:37,048
Little closer.

830
01:14:38,313 --> 01:14:42,218
Mamma mia!

831
01:14:52,637 --> 01:14:54,868
Huh?

832
01:15:20,828 --> 01:15:22,632
- That's beautiful.
- You made these, right?

833
01:15:25,131 --> 01:15:27,703
Huh? Whoa.

834
01:15:46,757 --> 01:15:48,790
Huh?

835
01:15:49,518 --> 01:15:50,825
Brooklyn?

836
01:15:52,387 --> 01:15:53,520
Mario?

837
01:15:54,730 --> 01:15:57,293
You almost dented my...

838
01:16:27,391 --> 01:16:30,062
Mario!

839
01:16:34,671 --> 01:16:36,398
You want this?

840
01:16:48,685 --> 01:16:50,444
You ruined my wedding!

841
01:16:50,445 --> 01:16:53,382
I was finally gonna be happy!

842
01:16:55,056 --> 01:16:58,760
Now you will suffer!

843
01:16:58,761 --> 01:17:01,357
Like me!

844
01:17:15,439 --> 01:17:18,670
You really thought
you could stop me?

845
01:17:18,671 --> 01:17:21,882
You worthless,
weak little nothing.

846
01:17:21,883 --> 01:17:23,884
Come out and fight!

847
01:17:23,885 --> 01:17:26,250
Or are you too scared?

848
01:17:30,551 --> 01:17:32,058
Just what I thought.

849
01:17:50,747 --> 01:17:52,671
MARIO and LUIGI Mamma mia!

850
01:17:52,672 --> 01:17:55,113
That's why the Sup-Super
Mario Brothers are here.

851
01:17:55,114 --> 01:17:57,610
A-to save Brooklyn...
save Brooklyn...

852
01:17:57,611 --> 01:18:00,218
Brooklyn... save Brooklyn.

853
01:18:17,974 --> 01:18:20,139
Let's-a go.

854
01:18:25,045 --> 01:18:26,574
Hey.

855
01:18:27,643 --> 01:18:29,180
Leave him alone.

856
01:18:29,181 --> 01:18:31,447
Mario?

857
01:18:32,481 --> 01:18:34,416
You just don't know
when to quit.

858
01:18:34,417 --> 01:18:35,648
Yeah.

859
01:18:35,649 --> 01:18:37,354
I've been told that before.

860
01:18:40,491 --> 01:18:41,688
Mario!

861
01:18:44,902 --> 01:18:46,968
The star!

862
01:18:47,597 --> 01:18:49,069
No! That's mine!

863
01:19:09,388 --> 01:19:10,486
Lu.

864
01:19:12,490 --> 01:19:15,458
Nothing can hurt us
as long as we're together.

865
01:19:26,405 --> 01:19:27,536
No!

866
01:19:41,519 --> 01:19:42,519
Huh?

867
01:19:48,425 --> 01:19:51,164
Rip them to pieces!

868
01:20:02,947 --> 01:20:04,374
Oh, hey, Spike.

869
01:20:04,375 --> 01:20:05,673
Luigi?

870
01:20:20,459 --> 01:20:22,162
No!

871
01:20:22,758 --> 01:20:25,000
Mamma mia.

872
01:21:16,051 --> 01:21:17,645
Peaches.

873
01:21:17,646 --> 01:21:20,186
Uh, listen, this is not
the way I pictured it,

874
01:21:20,187 --> 01:21:22,353
but give me one more chance.

875
01:21:22,354 --> 01:21:24,421
Ew, no.

876
01:21:24,422 --> 01:21:26,885
No, no, no, no, n...

877
01:21:26,886 --> 01:21:28,755
Hey! Hey!

878
01:21:28,756 --> 01:21:30,295
That is not cool!

879
01:21:30,296 --> 01:21:32,330
Ha! He got the blue mushroom!

880
01:21:32,331 --> 01:21:34,794
Eh? I told you I'd get you
a pet turtle.

881
01:21:34,795 --> 01:21:38,006
Not bad, Mustache.

882
01:21:38,007 --> 01:21:41,042
And, Luigi, you're so brave.

883
01:21:41,043 --> 01:21:42,439
Oh. Thanks, uh...

884
01:21:42,440 --> 01:21:44,111
Yeah, it's kind of my thing.

885
01:21:44,112 --> 01:21:46,839
Oh, my boys, my heroes!

886
01:21:46,840 --> 01:21:48,544
Woo-hoo!

887
01:21:48,545 --> 01:21:52,581
Mario, you were amazing.

888
01:21:52,582 --> 01:21:55,089
Thanks, Dad.

889
01:21:55,090 --> 01:21:57,125
Ah, bring it in!

890
01:22:03,166 --> 01:22:06,860
Let's hear it for
the Super Mario Brothers!

891
01:22:16,608 --> 01:22:19,047
These are my boys.

892
01:22:19,048 --> 01:22:20,874
H-Hey!

893
01:22:26,946 --> 01:22:29,058
Yes!

894
01:22:59,946 --> 01:23:01,849
- Morning.
- Hello.

895
01:23:09,232 --> 01:23:11,727
Woo-hoo!

896
01:23:25,873 --> 01:23:27,841
Now, that's a happy ending.

897
01:23:27,842 --> 01:23:29,183
Or is it?

898
01:23:29,184 --> 01:23:30,910
Because everything's over now,

899
01:23:30,911 --> 01:23:35,322
and all that's left is you
and the infinite void.

900
01:23:36,226 --> 01:23:38,622
Kind of makes you want
to play saxophone, huh?

901
01:26:48,977 --> 01:26:50,978
Hey. Quiet in there.

902
01:26:50,979 --> 01:26:52,287
Lights out, little guy.

903
01:26:52,288 --> 01:26:54,982
Hey!
You can't treat me like this.

904
01:26:54,983 --> 01:26:56,555
Do you know who I am?

905
01:26:56,556 --> 01:26:58,888
I am Bow...

906
01:32:19,716 --> 01:32:21,408
<i>Yoshi!</i>
13:05,189 --> 01:13:06,495
Launch the bomber bill

907
01:13:06,496 --> 01:13:09,928
and destroy
the mushroom kingdom!

908
01:13:20,908 --> 01:13:22,875
No.

909
01:13:29,620 --> 01:13:32,115
Hey, hey. Hey, over here.

910
01:13:42,831 --> 01:13:45,095
You asked for it.

911
01:13:53,171 --> 01:13:54,808
Hello.

912
01:14:14,597 --> 01:14:16,896
Ow!

913
01:14:18,636 --> 01:14:20,163
Really?

914
01:14:25,005 --> 01:14:27,038
Follow me.

915
01:14:31,374 --> 01:14:33,583
Come on.

916
01:14:34,784 --> 01:14:37,048
Little closer.

917
01:14:38,313 --> 01:14:42,218
Mamma Mia!

918
01:14:52,637 --> 01:14:54,868
- Huh?

919
01:15:20,828 --> 01:15:22,632
- That's beautiful.
- You made these, right?

920
01:15:25,131 --> 01:15:27,703
- Huh? Whoa.

921
01:15:46,757 --> 01:15:48,790
Huh?

922
01:15:49,518 --> 01:15:50,825
Brooklyn?

923
01:15:52,387 --> 01:15:53,520
Mario?

924
01:15:54,730 --> 01:15:57,293
- You almost dented my...

925
01:16:27,391 --> 01:16:30,062
Mario!

926
01:16:34,671 --> 01:16:36,398
You want this?

927
01:16:48,685 --> 01:16:50,444
You ruined my wedding!

928
01:16:50,445 --> 01:16:53,382
I was finally gonna be happy!

929
01:16:55,056 --> 01:16:58,760
- Now you will suffer!

930
01:16:58,761 --> 01:17:01,357
Like me!

931
01:17:15,439 --> 01:17:18,670
You really thought
you could stop me?

932
01:17:18,671 --> 01:17:21,882
You worthless,
weak little nothing.

933
01:17:21,883 --> 01:17:23,884
Come out and fight!

934
01:17:23,885 --> 01:17:26,250
Or are you too scared?

935
01:17:30,551 --> 01:17:32,058
Just what I thought.

936
01:17:50,747 --> 01:17:52,671
Mario and Luigi mamma Mia!

937
01:17:52,672 --> 01:17:55,113
That's why the sup-super
Mario brothers are here.

938
01:17:55,114 --> 01:17:57,610
A-to save Brooklyn...
Save Brooklyn...

939
01:17:57,611 --> 01:18:00,218
Brooklyn... save Brooklyn.

940
01:18:17,974 --> 01:18:20,139
Let's-a go.

941
01:18:25,045 --> 01:18:26,574
Hey.

942
01:18:27,643 --> 01:18:29,180
Leave him alone.

943
01:18:29,181 --> 01:18:31,447
Mario?

944
01:18:32,481 --> 01:18:34,416
You just don't know
when to quit.

945
01:18:34,417 --> 01:18:35,648
Yeah.

946
01:18:35,649 --> 01:18:37,354
I've been told that before.

947
01:18:40,491 --> 01:18:41,688
Mario!

948
01:18:44,902 --> 01:18:46,968
The star!

949
01:18:47,597 --> 01:18:49,069
No! That's mine!

950
01:19:09,388 --> 01:19:10,486
Lu.

951
01:19:12,490 --> 01:19:15,458
Nothing can hurt us
as long as we're together.

952
01:19:26,405 --> 01:19:27,536
No!

953
01:19:41,519 --> 01:19:42,519
Huh?

954
01:19:48,425 --> 01:19:51,164
- Rip them to pieces!

955
01:20:02,947 --> 01:20:04,374
Oh, hey, spike.

956
01:20:04,375 --> 01:20:05,673
Luigi?

957
01:20:20,459 --> 01:20:22,162
- No!

958
01:20:22,758 --> 01:20:25,000
Mamma Mia.

959
01:21:16,051 --> 01:21:17,645
Peaches.

960
01:21:17,646 --> 01:21:20,186
Uh, listen, this is not
the way I pictured it,

961
01:21:20,187 --> 01:21:22,353
but give me one more chance.

962
01:21:22,354 --> 01:21:24,421
Ew, no.

963
01:21:24,422 --> 01:21:26,885
No, no, no, no, n...

964
01:21:26,886 --> 01:21:28,755
Hey! Hey!

965
01:21:28,756 --> 01:21:30,295
That is not cool!

966
01:21:30,296 --> 01:21:32,330
Ha! He got the blue mushroom!

967
01:21:32,331 --> 01:21:34,794
Eh? I told you I'd get you
a pet turtle.

968
01:21:34,795 --> 01:21:38,006
Not bad, mustache.

969
01:21:38,007 --> 01:21:41,042
And, Luigi, you're so brave.

970
01:21:41,043 --> 01:21:42,439
Oh. Thanks, uh...

971
01:21:42,440 --> 01:21:44,111
Yeah, it's kind of my thing.

972
01:21:44,112 --> 01:21:46,839
Oh, my boys, my heroes!

973
01:21:46,840 --> 01:21:48,544
Woo-hoo!

974
01:21:48,545 --> 01:21:52,581
Mario, you were amazing.

975
01:21:52,582 --> 01:21:55,089
Thanks, dad.

976
01:21:55,090 --> 01:21:57,125
- Ah, bring it in!

977
01:22:03,166 --> 01:22:06,860
Let's hear it for
the super Mario brothers!

978
01:22:16,608 --> 01:22:19,047

979
01:22:19,048 --> 01:22:20,874
