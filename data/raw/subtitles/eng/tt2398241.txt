1
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:15,574
Ha-ha!

2
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:16,642
Whee!

3
00:01:26,886 --> 00:01:30,756
<i>This story begins
in a secret place</i>

4
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:32,958
<i>hidden deep in a forest.</i>

5
00:01:35,862 --> 00:01:37,863
Whoa, whoa!

6
00:01:37,865 --> 00:01:39,731
<i>That is a smurf.</i>

7
00:01:39,733 --> 00:01:42,234
<i>We call him clumsy.</i>

8
00:01:42,236 --> 00:01:44,536
<i>And this is our village,</i>

9
00:01:44,538 --> 00:01:48,140
<i>where there's a smurf
for just about everything.</i>

10
00:01:48,142 --> 00:01:49,541
<i>Like jokey.</i>

11
00:01:49,543 --> 00:01:51,210
Hey, here's a present for you.

12
00:01:51,212 --> 00:01:53,378
Ah!

13
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:56,548
Oh, gullible smurf,
you're so gullible.

14
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,750
Actually, I meant
to give you this one.

15
00:01:58,752 --> 00:01:59,885
Wow! Thanks!

16
00:02:01,355 --> 00:02:04,756
- 96, 97, 98, 99, 100.
<i>- Here's hefty.</i>

17
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,159
<i>And over here is...</i>

18
00:02:07,161 --> 00:02:08,760
Now, for the
one-fingered pushup.

19
00:02:08,762 --> 00:02:10,295
One, two, three...

20
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:12,197
<i>Meet nerdy smurf.</i>

21
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:13,298
Excuse me?

22
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,434
<i>Sorry, brainy. Just kidding.</i>

23
00:02:15,436 --> 00:02:16,535
<i>Nosey.</i>

24
00:02:16,537 --> 00:02:19,371
Hmm. Well, what's
going on over there?

25
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,907
<i>Paranoid smurf.</i>

26
00:02:21,909 --> 00:02:22,941
<i>Winner.</i>

27
00:02:22,943 --> 00:02:24,176
Hmm.

28
00:02:24,178 --> 00:02:25,277
<i>Loser.</i>

29
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:26,712
<i>Karate smurf.</i>

30
00:02:26,714 --> 00:02:27,913
Hyah!

31
00:02:27,915 --> 00:02:30,616
<i>Handy. Vanity.
Farmer. Painter. Baker.</i>

32
00:02:30,618 --> 00:02:33,085
<i>Magician. Scuba.
Policeman. Therapist.</i>

33
00:02:33,087 --> 00:02:34,453
Sometimes I just feel blue.

34
00:02:34,455 --> 00:02:36,722
<i>There's even
table-eating smurf.</i>

35
00:02:36,724 --> 00:02:38,056
Oh, hi.

36
00:02:38,058 --> 00:02:40,626
<i>Yeah, we're not too
sure about him, either.</i>

37
00:02:40,628 --> 00:02:43,262
<i>And then there's me, papa smurf.</i>

38
00:02:43,264 --> 00:02:45,130
<i>I sort of run this place.</i>

39
00:02:45,132 --> 00:02:47,599
<i>But this isn't a story about me.</i>

40
00:02:47,601 --> 00:02:49,334
Whoa...

41
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:50,769
<i>Or clumsy.</i>

42
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:52,771
<i>Or any of them.</i>

43
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:56,508
<i>It's about the only girl
in our village.</i>

44
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,210
<i>Smurfette.</i>

45
00:02:58,212 --> 00:02:59,444
Hi, laundry smurf.

46
00:02:59,446 --> 00:03:01,413
Howdy-do, Smurfette.
Hey, guys.

47
00:03:01,415 --> 00:03:03,282
<i>But that's not the only thing</i>

48
00:03:03,284 --> 00:03:04,716
<i>that's different
about Smurfette.</i>

49
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:10,822
<i>She was created
by the evil wizard, Gargamel.</i>

50
00:03:10,824 --> 00:03:12,691
<i>Using dark magic...</i>

51
00:03:14,161 --> 00:03:16,328
<i>he made her from a lump of Clay.</i>

52
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:20,866
Now, go and find smurf village.

53
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:26,805
<i>Luckily, I knew
a little magic of my own.</i>

54
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:36,682
<i>But there was still one problem.</i>

55
00:03:36,684 --> 00:03:40,118
<i>Smurfette's name doesn't
tell us anything about her.</i>

56
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,820
Okay, the physics are...

57
00:03:43,224 --> 00:03:44,856
<i>It doesn't tell us who she is.</i>
Hyah!

58
00:03:44,858 --> 00:03:47,526
High heels.
<i>Or what she does.</i>

59
00:03:47,528 --> 00:03:52,297
<i>So, what exactly is a Smurfette?</i>

60
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:55,567
Well, let me be frank.
She's a rubbish Baker.

61
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:57,569
Let's see. Smurfette.

62
00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:59,905
Smurfette, Smurfette, Smurfette.

63
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:01,640
Huh. It's not here.

64
00:04:01,642 --> 00:04:05,143
Well, Smurfette is a combination
of a smurf and an ette.

65
00:04:05,145 --> 00:04:06,878
But what's an ette?

66
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:12,985
Oh, uh, yeah.
Smurfette, well, she's...

67
00:04:12,987 --> 00:04:15,320
She's the greatest.

68
00:04:16,657 --> 00:04:21,093
The most wondrous
creature on earth.

69
00:04:21,095 --> 00:04:23,128
Yes, you are.

70
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,796
Smurfette...

71
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:27,332
Um...

72
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:28,800
Oh! I got it.

73
00:04:28,802 --> 00:04:30,669
This is one of
those eternal questions

74
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:33,538
that we'll never,
ever know the answer to.

75
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:37,776
Huh? Wait, she is?

76
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:39,278
Do you think she heard me?

77
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,281
<i>So, what is a Smurfette?</i>

78
00:04:42,283 --> 00:04:46,985
<i>No one wanted that answer
more than Smurfette herself.</i>

79
00:04:59,033 --> 00:05:00,365
What are you doing?

80
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:01,533
Oh.

81
00:05:01,535 --> 00:05:03,302
Hey, grouchy, I was just...

82
00:05:03,304 --> 00:05:05,203
Leaving?

83
00:05:05,205 --> 00:05:07,606
Um...
This is my bench.

84
00:05:07,608 --> 00:05:10,208
I come here same time
every day, and I...

85
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:12,711
Ooh. Let me guess.
"And grouch."

86
00:05:12,713 --> 00:05:14,313
Exactly.

87
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:18,483
I can do that.
I can grouch.

88
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:21,353
Hi, grouchy. Hi, Smurfette.
Nice day, huh?

89
00:05:21,355 --> 00:05:22,754
No, it's not.

90
00:05:22,756 --> 00:05:24,756
It's gonna rain!

91
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:29,194
Which actually helps
the plants grow.

92
00:05:29,196 --> 00:05:35,167
But also means it's gonna be
cloudy, so, chew on that.

93
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:37,502
Then again, there
might be a rainbow.

94
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:39,705
But rainbows are dumb.

95
00:05:39,707 --> 00:05:42,941
Just kidding.
I love rainbows.

96
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:44,609
Ugh.

97
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:46,445
You're not very good
at this, are ya?

98
00:05:46,447 --> 00:05:48,847
Uh, no, I'm not.

99
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:51,817
In fact, you're actually
kind of bad at it.

100
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:53,785
Yup.

101
00:05:55,254 --> 00:05:57,155
But you're also bad at it.

102
00:05:57,157 --> 00:05:58,490
That's a lie.

103
00:05:58,492 --> 00:06:00,859
You're really,
really good at it.

104
00:06:04,163 --> 00:06:05,430
Hi, brainy.

105
00:06:05,432 --> 00:06:07,332
Ah. Smurfette.
Thank goodness you're here.

106
00:06:07,334 --> 00:06:09,735
I was... whoa!

107
00:06:09,737 --> 00:06:12,537
Whoa. We're running trials
on my new invention.

108
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:15,273
The Smurfy thing finder.

109
00:06:15,275 --> 00:06:17,309
Test subject, hefty smurf.

110
00:06:17,311 --> 00:06:18,677
Oh, hey, Smurfette!

111
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:20,445
I mean, uh...

112
00:06:20,447 --> 00:06:24,182
Hey, Smurfette.
Oh, hey.

113
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:25,684
That thing's safe, right?

114
00:06:25,686 --> 00:06:28,553
- Is it safe?
- Of course.

115
00:06:29,757 --> 00:06:31,623
I'd get back here if I were you.

116
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:34,893
Snappy bug.

117
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:43,034
Take this down. Smurfy
thing finder trial 1.03.

118
00:06:43,036 --> 00:06:44,136
Ready, hefty?

119
00:06:44,138 --> 00:06:45,537
Roger that.

120
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:52,377
Whoa!
It works!

121
00:06:53,781 --> 00:06:55,580
Wow. This thing
really gets me.

122
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:57,949
It's able to hone in on
hefty's dominant trait.

123
00:06:57,951 --> 00:06:59,317
Super strength.

124
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:01,753
Which I distill into this.

125
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:04,856
I call it brainy's
super Smurfy power fuel.

126
00:07:04,858 --> 00:07:06,958
Here, you can try it first.

127
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:09,895
All clear!

128
00:07:09,897 --> 00:07:12,697
Yeah, you see, when you say
things like "all clear,"

129
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:14,099
it makes me not want to...

130
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:15,500
Whoa!
Hey, guys.

131
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:21,540
Hi, clumsy.

132
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:23,942
You're just in time
to witness scientific history.

133
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:26,545
Oh. What's going on
in here?

134
00:07:26,547 --> 00:07:29,514
None of your business, nosey.

135
00:07:29,516 --> 00:07:32,484
Hmm. Well, all right.

136
00:07:32,486 --> 00:07:36,621
Hey! If that vegetable hat can
tell us that hefty is strong,

137
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:39,491
maybe it can tell me
what an ette is.

138
00:07:39,493 --> 00:07:40,892
Power it up, brainy.

139
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,257
Whoa.

140
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:13,492
Fascinating.

141
00:08:13,494 --> 00:08:15,260
What happened?

142
00:08:15,262 --> 00:08:19,030
Somehow, instead of sending
energy out, you absorbed it.

143
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:20,932
Probably something
to do with the fact

144
00:08:20,934 --> 00:08:22,901
that you're not a real...

145
00:08:22,903 --> 00:08:26,671
A real smurf? Go
ahead, you can say it.

146
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:28,507
No, no, I just meant that

147
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:33,812
this machine wasn't built for a
smurf of your, well, origins.

148
00:08:33,814 --> 00:08:36,681
Yeah, it's okay. I get it.

149
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,518
Brainy.

150
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:43,188
Hey, you know what? Let's
all go have some fun.

151
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,556
Yeah!

152
00:08:44,558 --> 00:08:46,558
- Pizza!
- Smurfboarding!

153
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,059
Smurfboarding!

154
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:57,335
It's almost ready, Azrael.

155
00:08:58,438 --> 00:09:00,472
A pinch of newt poo.

156
00:09:00,474 --> 00:09:04,876
A gram of calcified fungus from
between the toes of a yak.

157
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:07,913
And a piece of cheese I left
in my underpants last week.

158
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,053
That ought to do it.

159
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,090
Presto!

160
00:09:19,092 --> 00:09:22,627
Twelve spherical
petrification modules.

161
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:26,731
Or, as I like to
call 'em, freeze balls.

162
00:09:28,101 --> 00:09:32,103
You're welcome, Azrael.
Dinner is served.

163
00:09:33,507 --> 00:09:35,040
Ingrate.

164
00:09:35,042 --> 00:09:38,410
Besides, these freeze balls
aren't for catching mice.

165
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:42,681
They're for capturing
those elusive smurfs.

166
00:09:42,683 --> 00:09:44,015
My holy grail.

167
00:09:44,017 --> 00:09:46,418
The gold at the end
of my rainbow.

168
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:50,388
The most potent magical
ingredient in the world.

169
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,990
Next slide.

170
00:09:51,992 --> 00:09:56,561
Imagine the power in
100 of them combined.

171
00:09:57,764 --> 00:10:00,599
How I've searched high and low,

172
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:02,167
under every rock, it seems,

173
00:10:02,169 --> 00:10:03,969
with no sign of them anywhere.

174
00:10:03,971 --> 00:10:07,138
Not now, Azrael. I'm in
the middle of a lecture.

175
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:09,774
My plan is simple.

176
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:13,778
Find smurf village, capture all the
smurfs, drain them of their magic

177
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:16,214
and, finally,
use that magic to become

178
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:20,018
the most powerful
wizard in the world!

179
00:10:22,756 --> 00:10:24,389
Oh, look at me with hair.

180
00:10:24,391 --> 00:10:26,191
What?

181
00:10:26,193 --> 00:10:28,860
Why didn't you say
so in the first place?

182
00:10:28,862 --> 00:10:31,529
Blue blazes!

183
00:10:31,531 --> 00:10:33,565
I've spotted smurfs
in the forest!

184
00:10:34,735 --> 00:10:37,002
Well, it's
my telescope. Monty!

185
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:40,939
Come, my majestic eagle.

186
00:10:49,182 --> 00:10:51,816
Your talons are digging
into my shoulders. Ow!

187
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:52,917
Oh, that's better.

188
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:54,986
Now, fly.

189
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:58,056
Go capture me some smurfs.

190
00:10:58,058 --> 00:10:59,557
No, no!

191
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:02,260
No, you're going the wrong way!

192
00:11:05,265 --> 00:11:06,331
Ha-ha!

193
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:10,201
Ooh! Whoo!

194
00:11:10,203 --> 00:11:11,436
Whoa! Huh!

195
00:11:11,438 --> 00:11:13,705
Hyah! Yeah!

196
00:11:13,707 --> 00:11:15,707
Ooh! Whoa.

197
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,376
Whoa!

198
00:11:19,211 --> 00:11:20,445
Yeah!

199
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:23,148
Whoo-hoo!

200
00:11:28,422 --> 00:11:30,689
Oh, no.

201
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:32,824
My turn!

202
00:11:32,826 --> 00:11:34,626
Safety third.

203
00:11:34,628 --> 00:11:36,428
Oh, boy.

204
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:37,862
Whoa!

205
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:40,165
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!

206
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:41,399
Whoa!

207
00:11:49,476 --> 00:11:50,809
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

208
00:11:50,811 --> 00:11:54,079
Whoa! Yeah!

209
00:11:54,081 --> 00:11:55,280
Wow!

210
00:11:55,282 --> 00:11:57,882
Really takes your
breath away, doesn't she?

211
00:11:57,884 --> 00:11:59,984
This is incredible!

212
00:11:59,986 --> 00:12:02,520
Whoa. Oh... uh-oh.

213
00:12:02,522 --> 00:12:03,855
Huh? Oh, no!

214
00:12:03,857 --> 00:12:05,356
She's getting way too close

215
00:12:05,358 --> 00:12:07,025
to the forbidden forest.

216
00:12:07,027 --> 00:12:09,260
She can't go over that wall.
Come on.

217
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:15,633
Whoa! Oh!

218
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:26,244
No, no, no, wait.
Don't go.

219
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:30,248
Wait. Wait, who are you?
Don't be afraid.

220
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,150
Hey, you can't go in there.

221
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,458
- Smurfette!
- Smurfette!

222
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,793
Smurfette, you okay?

223
00:12:41,795 --> 00:12:42,861
What happened?
What happened?

224
00:12:42,863 --> 00:12:45,797
I saw a smurf.

225
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:47,065
What?
Who was it?

226
00:12:47,067 --> 00:12:49,934
I don't know,
but he was wearing this.

227
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:53,538
Smurfette! Code blue!

228
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,839
Guys, come on.

229
00:12:57,611 --> 00:12:59,277
We've gotta get her.

230
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,679
I have a bad feeling about this.

231
00:13:01,681 --> 00:13:03,014
Oh, do you?

232
00:13:03,016 --> 00:13:04,349
Does it have to do
with the giant vulture

233
00:13:04,351 --> 00:13:07,218
carrying our friend off
to Gargamel's lair?

234
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,228
Monty, my regal raptor.

235
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:19,430
You've done it,
you've caught a smurf.

236
00:13:19,432 --> 00:13:20,598
Give me a kiss.

237
00:13:24,437 --> 00:13:27,105
Finally, you bring me
what I've been asking for.

238
00:13:27,107 --> 00:13:29,674
A tiny, blue-skinned,
shirtless... you!

239
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:33,845
Let me out of here, you
smurf-obsessed wannabe wizard.

240
00:13:33,847 --> 00:13:36,080
Oh, is that any way
to talk to the man

241
00:13:36,082 --> 00:13:38,416
who brought you into this world?

242
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:43,021
I'd prefer it if you
just called me "papa."

243
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,424
I would never call you that.

244
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:47,759
Your loss.

245
00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:51,663
What's this?
What are you hiding?

246
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:55,700
Hand it over,
you pseudo-smurf.

247
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:58,203
Thank you, Azrael.

248
00:13:59,372 --> 00:14:00,572
Hmm.

249
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:04,008
What do we have here? Hmm...

250
00:14:05,846 --> 00:14:09,013
A different design? Yes, of course,
I noticed that right away.

251
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:10,882
Slightly before
you did, in fact.

252
00:14:11,985 --> 00:14:13,184
Where did you get it?

253
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:15,086
I'm not telling you anything.

254
00:14:15,088 --> 00:14:17,088
Tell me.
No.

255
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:18,323
Tell me!
No!

256
00:14:18,325 --> 00:14:19,891
You better tell me.
No!

257
00:14:19,893 --> 00:14:23,428
Fine. Don't tell me. I won't.

258
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:26,264
Stupid reverse
psychology never works.

259
00:14:26,266 --> 00:14:29,367
Who cares? You've already
given me what I need.

260
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:31,402
Come along, Azrael.

261
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:38,343
Ah, where on earth
did I put those ingredients?

262
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,047
Oh, I know this.
Go left, then right,

263
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:45,617
back handspring,
stick the landing.

264
00:14:47,287 --> 00:14:49,320
Is it a person, book or movie?

265
00:14:49,322 --> 00:14:52,290
No one ever understands
your hand signals, hefty.

266
00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:56,227
Ah, never mind. Just
follow me and stay close.

267
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:03,368
Wart of worm and hair of cat.

268
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:10,408
Show me the home
of this smurf hat.

269
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:23,321
<i>Long have you searched
for these creatures of blue.</i>

270
00:15:23,323 --> 00:15:26,491
<i>But this hat comes
from somewhere new.</i>

271
00:15:26,493 --> 00:15:28,660
Yes. Where? Where
does it come from?

272
00:15:28,662 --> 00:15:32,997
<i>A village of smurfs,
where enchantment grows.</i>

273
00:15:32,999 --> 00:15:36,234
Oh. An entire village.
Good. Go on. Go on.

274
00:15:36,236 --> 00:15:37,936
<i>The location of which...</i>

275
00:15:37,938 --> 00:15:40,338
Yes?
<i>Nobody knows.</i>

276
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:44,976
No! Just start with that.
Start with "I don't know."

277
00:15:44,978 --> 00:15:46,711
Lousy cheap-o cauldron.

278
00:15:46,713 --> 00:15:48,179
Ow!

279
00:15:48,181 --> 00:15:50,381
<i>But here is a clue.</i>

280
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:56,354
Fascinating.
But what is it?

281
00:15:58,992 --> 00:16:01,125
Trees?

282
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:03,594
Must be a symbol for
something, or a code.

283
00:16:03,596 --> 00:16:07,432
Trees, trees, breeze, knees.
Babies crawl on their knees.

284
00:16:07,434 --> 00:16:09,600
Check all the nurseries
in the area!

285
00:16:11,037 --> 00:16:13,104
We're going to need to
disguise ourselves as babies.

286
00:16:13,106 --> 00:16:16,140
Now, where can I
get a giant diaper?

287
00:16:17,277 --> 00:16:19,177
Azrael, it's not your map.

288
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:22,547
You want your own map, we'll get you
your own map, but this is my...

289
00:16:22,549 --> 00:16:25,416
Wait a minute.
Look what I found.

290
00:16:25,418 --> 00:16:30,855
Three tall trees,
in the forbidden forest.

291
00:16:32,092 --> 00:16:34,025
We've never
searched there before.

292
00:16:34,027 --> 00:16:36,794
I'm a genius.

293
00:16:36,796 --> 00:16:38,096
Psst.

294
00:16:38,098 --> 00:16:41,399
Azrael, it's time
to take a road trip.

295
00:16:41,401 --> 00:16:42,600
Shh.

296
00:16:42,602 --> 00:16:44,235
Prepare my trail mix.

297
00:16:44,237 --> 00:16:47,905
Oh, Smurfette, congratulations.

298
00:16:47,907 --> 00:16:49,540
You've just led me

299
00:16:49,542 --> 00:16:54,045
to an undiscovered
population of smurfs.

300
00:16:54,047 --> 00:16:56,414
They have no idea we even exist.

301
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:58,616
I'll be like...

302
00:16:58,618 --> 00:17:00,451
They'll be all like,
"oh, no!"

303
00:17:00,453 --> 00:17:02,086
And I'll be like...

304
00:17:02,088 --> 00:17:04,155
- And they'll be like...
- "Run! No!

305
00:17:04,157 --> 00:17:05,923
"Run, run, run!"

306
00:17:05,925 --> 00:17:08,726
You evil little genius.

307
00:17:08,728 --> 00:17:11,095
The rotten apple
doesn't fall too far

308
00:17:11,097 --> 00:17:12,897
from the tree after all.

309
00:17:12,899 --> 00:17:14,565
Does it?

310
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:18,903
Get your fur and
feathers in gear, boys.

311
00:17:18,905 --> 00:17:20,671
We leave at first light.

312
00:17:20,673 --> 00:17:23,674
Right after breakfast, say 8:00, 8:30.
9:00 at the latest.

313
00:17:23,676 --> 00:17:26,811
Wait, brainy, the map.
I'm on it.

314
00:17:28,581 --> 00:17:31,916
Fine, maybe 9:30. Absolutely
no later than 10:00, though.

315
00:17:31,918 --> 00:17:33,084
What the...

316
00:17:33,086 --> 00:17:34,352
It's a jailbreak!
Go, go, go!

317
00:17:34,354 --> 00:17:37,622
They know my plans.
They'll ruin everything!

318
00:17:37,624 --> 00:17:38,990
Is this safe?

319
00:17:38,992 --> 00:17:42,493
Well, it's a giant crossbow,
so I'm gonna go with "no."

320
00:17:42,495 --> 00:17:44,495
Don't let them escape.

321
00:17:46,966 --> 00:17:48,599
Aah!

322
00:17:48,601 --> 00:17:50,034
Where are the seat belts?

323
00:17:50,036 --> 00:17:52,737
Get them!
Get those smurfs!

324
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:54,705
Fire in the hole!

325
00:18:01,147 --> 00:18:03,114
Get those smurfs!

326
00:18:06,186 --> 00:18:07,852
Azrael's gaining on us.

327
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:14,659
Incoming bird!

328
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:21,199
This might hurt.
No!

329
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:35,046
Huh?

330
00:18:35,048 --> 00:18:37,248
Come on. Smurf this way.

331
00:19:04,711 --> 00:19:06,010
Run faster! Run faster!

332
00:19:06,012 --> 00:19:08,212
Why are our legs so short?

333
00:19:08,214 --> 00:19:10,348
Why are our feet so big?

334
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:12,817
Why are my muscles so big?

335
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:14,051
Really, man?

336
00:19:21,594 --> 00:19:24,362
Guys! Guys!
A little help here.

337
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:27,331
It's coming.

338
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,679
Yes!
All right!

339
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:44,715
Well, I know four smurfs

340
00:19:44,717 --> 00:19:47,218
who have some explaining to do.

341
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,853
Oh, boy.
Hi.

342
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:50,555
Oh, my gosh. Papa,
you will not believe it.

343
00:19:50,557 --> 00:19:52,390
We ran into
the forbidden forest.

344
00:19:52,392 --> 00:19:54,058
One at a time.
One at a time.

345
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,594
Please. Please.

346
00:19:56,596 --> 00:19:57,895
Smurfette sees
this mystery smurf.

347
00:19:57,897 --> 00:19:59,377
We have to go to
the forbidden forest.

348
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:01,866
I've told you time and again,

349
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:04,435
the forbidden forest
is forbidden.

350
00:20:04,437 --> 00:20:05,770
And now you're
talking about maps

351
00:20:05,772 --> 00:20:08,639
and mystery smurfs
and Gargamel's lair.

352
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:10,374
None of this makes any sense,

353
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:11,709
and I really don't understand

354
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:13,544
why you can't follow
simple rules.

355
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,880
You snuck out and it
put you all in danger.

356
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:18,883
Seems to me the only way
I can keep you safe is if...

357
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:21,252
You're grounded.

358
00:20:21,254 --> 00:20:22,453
Grounded? No, not grounded!
What? No way!

359
00:20:22,455 --> 00:20:24,155
But, papa, but...
Come on!

360
00:20:24,157 --> 00:20:25,856
No "buts."

361
00:20:25,858 --> 00:20:27,692
None of you are to take one
step out of your mushrooms

362
00:20:27,694 --> 00:20:29,093
without telling me where you're going.
Do you understand that?

363
00:20:29,095 --> 00:20:31,062
You're right, papa.
Huh? What?

364
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:32,797
Huh?
You're right.

365
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,765
I don't know what
we were thinking.

366
00:20:34,767 --> 00:20:36,200
Uh, good.

367
00:20:36,202 --> 00:20:37,668
Because, as I was saying,

368
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:40,905
you behaved completely
irresponsibly.

369
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:42,607
Yes. Right. Exactly.

370
00:20:42,609 --> 00:20:44,275
I couldn't agree more.
Right, guys?

371
00:20:44,277 --> 00:20:45,776
Uh... yeah, right.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

372
00:20:45,778 --> 00:20:47,478
What are you talking
about, Smurfette? Okay.

373
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,614
Yes, so...
And furthermore...

374
00:20:49,616 --> 00:20:52,350
In fact, I think we should all
go to our rooms right now

375
00:20:52,352 --> 00:20:53,884
and think about what we've done.

376
00:20:53,886 --> 00:20:54,952
Well, I think that's...

377
00:20:54,954 --> 00:20:56,053
Tough, but fair.

378
00:20:56,055 --> 00:20:57,455
Come on, guys.
Okay, okay.

379
00:20:57,457 --> 00:20:58,990
Okay, I'm moving.
What's your endgame here?

380
00:20:58,992 --> 00:21:00,524
Did you get pecked
on the noggin, Smurfette?

381
00:21:00,526 --> 00:21:02,326
Actually, Smurfette...
Don't worry, papa.

382
00:21:02,328 --> 00:21:04,695
We are certainly going to do
some thinking about what we did.

383
00:21:04,697 --> 00:21:06,297
And so forth.

384
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:07,965
But we will definitely
not be leaving our rooms

385
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:09,834
until we've thought
this whole thing out.

386
00:21:09,836 --> 00:21:11,535
And then, just for good measure,

387
00:21:11,537 --> 00:21:12,903
we'll think about it some more.

388
00:21:12,905 --> 00:21:14,372
Yes, but...

389
00:21:14,374 --> 00:21:15,806
Great talk, papa.

390
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:18,409
Huh.

391
00:21:18,411 --> 00:21:21,379
I have no idea what I'm doing.

392
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:49,133
Hefty, I know that's you.

393
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:53,137
'Sup, Smurfette?

394
00:22:53,139 --> 00:22:54,338
Brainy.

395
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:55,639
How did you do that?

396
00:22:55,641 --> 00:22:57,775
And, I assume, clumsy.

397
00:22:58,276 --> 00:22:59,810
Whoa-oh!

398
00:22:59,812 --> 00:23:01,579
All good. What are you
guys doing out here?

399
00:23:01,581 --> 00:23:03,581
We knew you were up
to something.

400
00:23:03,583 --> 00:23:05,583
This is all my fault, hefty.

401
00:23:05,585 --> 00:23:08,352
But, Smurfette,
the forbidden forest?

402
00:23:08,354 --> 00:23:09,720
It's too dangerous.

403
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:12,556
I have to at least
warn that lost village.

404
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:15,593
Well, we're team smurf,
and we stick together.

405
00:23:15,595 --> 00:23:17,728
So, we're coming with you.

406
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,330
I can't ask you to do that.

407
00:23:19,332 --> 00:23:20,498
You didn't ask.

408
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,032
We volunteered.

409
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:24,635
Thanks, guys.

410
00:23:24,637 --> 00:23:26,070
First things first.

411
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:36,981
Wow! Bug technology.
Cool.

412
00:23:36,983 --> 00:23:39,049
According to my map,
we should be standing

413
00:23:39,051 --> 00:23:42,853
right in front of this
very large, tall stone wall.

414
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:45,122
Check.

415
00:24:02,174 --> 00:24:06,177
One small step for
four small smurfs...

416
00:24:09,982 --> 00:24:12,583
Okay.
Let us proceed.

417
00:24:29,267 --> 00:24:31,202
Wow.

418
00:24:31,204 --> 00:24:33,137
Wow, wow, wow.

419
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:39,844
Wow, wow, wow.

420
00:24:39,846 --> 00:24:41,212
Wow.

421
00:24:42,448 --> 00:24:45,483
Smurfette!
You okay, Smurfette?

422
00:24:46,351 --> 00:24:50,254
Nice flowers. Nice flowers.

423
00:24:50,256 --> 00:24:53,023
Not nice flowers!

424
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,593
Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

425
00:25:04,136 --> 00:25:05,202
Whoa!

426
00:25:12,879 --> 00:25:13,944
Whoa!

427
00:25:16,048 --> 00:25:18,716
Whoa...

428
00:25:18,718 --> 00:25:22,152
Whoa!
Aah!

429
00:25:29,562 --> 00:25:31,295
Where's clumsy?

430
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:39,603
Hey! We just met! I'm
not that kind of smurf.

431
00:25:57,122 --> 00:25:59,256
Watch out for
the steep embankment.

432
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:08,332
Clumsy, you okay?

433
00:26:09,634 --> 00:26:12,236
I'm seeing stars.

434
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:14,638
Whoa.

435
00:26:25,116 --> 00:26:27,651
Ooh.
Wow.

436
00:26:34,827 --> 00:26:36,627
Good work, clumsy.

437
00:26:36,629 --> 00:26:39,930
You may have discovered a new
subspecies of flying Insectoid.

438
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:50,941
Amazing! A winged,
fire-breathing Anisoptera.

439
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:53,711
Mmm, let's see. How
should we classify this?

440
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,513
Hmm, maybe.

441
00:26:56,515 --> 00:26:58,755
I mean, seems like an easy
choice, but I'm just not sure.

442
00:27:00,019 --> 00:27:01,752
Yeah, okay, let's go
with "dragonfly."

443
00:27:01,754 --> 00:27:04,321
Hopefully more
"fly" than "dragon."

444
00:27:04,323 --> 00:27:07,858
Nope! Less "fly"!
Less "fly"!

445
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:11,228
Whoa, guys!

446
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:13,597
Whoa...

447
00:27:15,167 --> 00:27:16,500
Whoa.

448
00:27:17,637 --> 00:27:19,036
I'm okay.

449
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:24,274
A little help here.

450
00:27:39,425 --> 00:27:41,492
Monty, get off of me.

451
00:27:43,329 --> 00:27:44,895
I hate nature.

452
00:27:44,897 --> 00:27:47,331
How gaudy.

453
00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:49,700
Hmm? Ow, ow!

454
00:27:56,908 --> 00:27:59,977
Azrael, do something!

455
00:27:59,979 --> 00:28:01,979
It's quite painful.

456
00:28:01,981 --> 00:28:05,883
Stop laughing.
This is not funny.

457
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,253
Watch it!

458
00:28:12,457 --> 00:28:14,892
Let me go!

459
00:28:19,964 --> 00:28:21,899
Ouch.

460
00:28:21,901 --> 00:28:23,901
Hmm. These nests are
made of some material

461
00:28:23,903 --> 00:28:25,436
I've never seen before.

462
00:28:26,438 --> 00:28:28,605
Whoa!

463
00:28:29,842 --> 00:28:31,975
You know,
I think I've had enough

464
00:28:31,977 --> 00:28:34,745
of these flying
antipastos for one day.

465
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:41,118
Hey!

466
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,853
What are you doing here?

467
00:28:42,855 --> 00:28:45,089
Well, I was thinking of getting
a little place out here.

468
00:28:45,091 --> 00:28:47,257
Just a quiet place
in the forest.

469
00:28:47,259 --> 00:28:48,926
It's a little breezy
up on the hill.

470
00:28:48,928 --> 00:28:50,594
What do you think
I'm doing out here?

471
00:28:50,596 --> 00:28:54,064
You are never going to find
that village, Gargamel.

472
00:28:54,066 --> 00:28:57,034
Oh, Smurfette,
if it wasn't for you,

473
00:28:57,036 --> 00:29:00,037
I wouldn't even know
about those other smurfs.

474
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:01,472
Get 'em, boys.

475
00:29:01,474 --> 00:29:03,340
Smurfintine formation! Go!

476
00:29:04,042 --> 00:29:05,142
Hey!

477
00:29:05,144 --> 00:29:06,043
Smurfintine!

478
00:29:06,045 --> 00:29:07,811
Get 'em, Azrael!
Smurfintine!

479
00:29:07,813 --> 00:29:10,013
Smurfintine!
Smurfintine!

480
00:29:11,382 --> 00:29:13,350
Ow!

481
00:29:16,522 --> 00:29:17,855
Smurfintine!

482
00:29:17,857 --> 00:29:20,090
Hey, you.
You're the clumsy one, right?

483
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:21,925
Huh?
Think fast.

484
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:24,228
I caught it!

485
00:29:27,332 --> 00:29:28,766
This isn't good.

486
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:32,836
Clumsy, give 'em back their egg!
Okay.

487
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:36,740
Oh, come on!

488
00:29:36,742 --> 00:29:37,808
Clumsy!

489
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:39,610
I'm trying!

490
00:29:39,612 --> 00:29:41,345
Whoa!

491
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:51,889
I'm really, really sorry, guys!

492
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:53,991
Over there!

493
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:03,700
I didn't mean to poach your egg.

494
00:30:03,702 --> 00:30:04,968
Whoa!

495
00:30:07,906 --> 00:30:10,040
Well, they're toast.

496
00:30:10,042 --> 00:30:11,708
Ah, it doesn't matter.

497
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:13,343
What's a few worthless pennies

498
00:30:13,345 --> 00:30:16,980
when there's a pot of gold
at the end of my rainbow?

499
00:30:18,517 --> 00:30:20,584
Trust me, they're goners.

500
00:30:20,586 --> 00:30:23,987
I'm telling you, they've
been fried to a blue crisp.

501
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:25,656
They're smurf kabobs.

502
00:30:25,658 --> 00:30:26,924
Smurfberry flambe.

503
00:30:26,926 --> 00:30:28,392
Marshmallows.

504
00:30:28,394 --> 00:30:30,627
Can it, fuzzball.
They're dead.

505
00:30:30,629 --> 00:30:32,529
Dead, I say!

506
00:30:47,913 --> 00:30:49,413
Hello?

507
00:30:50,882 --> 00:30:52,850
Smurfette?

508
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:57,087
Echo!

509
00:31:04,762 --> 00:31:06,296
Darkness.

510
00:31:06,298 --> 00:31:09,099
I don't do well in the darkness.

511
00:31:09,101 --> 00:31:10,834
I have enough trouble
in the daylight.

512
00:31:10,836 --> 00:31:14,838
Hold on, everyone. We need
to find a way out of here.

513
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:19,009
That is good thinking,
"brainy."

514
00:31:19,011 --> 00:31:20,711
- Guys?
- Darkness!

515
00:31:20,713 --> 00:31:25,515
Don't be scared. Just...
Just think happy thoughts.

516
00:31:25,517 --> 00:31:28,218
It's not really
happy times right now!

517
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:31,388
Just stay in the light, clumsy.
Too late.

518
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,123
I'm walking into the darkness!

519
00:31:33,125 --> 00:31:34,858
What are you... why?

520
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:38,061
I'm really
freaking out, you guys!

521
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:40,097
Stop, everyone.

522
00:31:40,099 --> 00:31:41,965
Okay, go into your backpacks,

523
00:31:41,967 --> 00:31:44,568
get out your emergency
tunnel survival kit,

524
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:48,205
find the small glass
vial marked "light,"

525
00:31:48,207 --> 00:31:50,507
and shake it really hard.

526
00:31:56,582 --> 00:31:58,615
Clumsy? How you doing?

527
00:31:58,617 --> 00:32:00,083
Okay, I guess.

528
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:01,618
Just hang tight, clumsy.

529
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,687
I'm not sure how
long this will take

530
00:32:03,689 --> 00:32:05,455
or how long we'll be down here,

531
00:32:05,457 --> 00:32:08,091
so, everybody, whatever you do,

532
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:10,260
don't eat all your rations.

533
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:12,696
I just ate all my rations!

534
00:32:12,698 --> 00:32:15,198
Clumsy!
I'm stress-eating!

535
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,800
I'm coming, clumsy.

536
00:32:16,802 --> 00:32:19,202
Follow the sound of my voice.

537
00:32:19,204 --> 00:32:21,571
Wait! These tunnels
are like a maze.

538
00:32:21,573 --> 00:32:22,906
We'll just get more lost.

539
00:32:22,908 --> 00:32:24,174
We gotta do something.

540
00:32:24,176 --> 00:32:26,610
I'm with her.
Time for some action.

541
00:32:26,612 --> 00:32:28,845
We're doing this all wrong.

542
00:32:28,847 --> 00:32:30,347
Smurfette!

543
00:32:30,349 --> 00:32:32,115
- I'm close, clumsy.
- Almost there.

544
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:34,952
That's just the echo
playing tricks on us.

545
00:32:34,954 --> 00:32:36,987
Anybody?
I'm here.

546
00:32:36,989 --> 00:32:39,656
I'm here right
around this corner.

547
00:32:39,658 --> 00:32:41,358
Hey, everybody?

548
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:47,597
My light is going out.

549
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:51,768
That is it! I'm punching
us out of here.

550
00:32:53,672 --> 00:32:55,238
It's collapsing.

551
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:58,475
Hefty! Put those fists away
before you get us killed!

552
00:32:58,477 --> 00:33:00,610
At least I'm trying something.

553
00:33:00,612 --> 00:33:03,246
I'm gonna blow us out of here!
No!

554
00:33:03,248 --> 00:33:04,948
Oh, yeah!
Don't!

555
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:06,350
Too late!

556
00:33:17,028 --> 00:33:19,296
Clumsy?

557
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:32,309
Hmm?

558
00:33:39,785 --> 00:33:41,551
Hey, Smurfette.
Clumsy!

559
00:33:42,453 --> 00:33:44,388
Whoa!

560
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:46,690
Whoa!

561
00:33:48,793 --> 00:33:51,061
Hang on.
I'm coming, clumsy bro.

562
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:53,630
I got you, little buddy.

563
00:33:57,201 --> 00:34:00,037
Yeah! Yee-haw!

564
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:13,150
Stampede!

565
00:34:13,152 --> 00:34:16,987
I think my rations
are coming up.

566
00:34:26,697 --> 00:34:27,798
Oh! Whoa, whoa.

567
00:34:34,339 --> 00:34:36,807
What?
What's so funny?

568
00:34:36,809 --> 00:34:39,709
Now, that's what I call
"talking out of your butt."

569
00:34:40,779 --> 00:34:42,079
Oh, boys.

570
00:34:42,081 --> 00:34:44,448
Would anyone be
interested in knowing

571
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:45,749
that we're in sight
of three tall trees?

572
00:34:45,751 --> 00:34:47,317
- All right.
- Yeah, we are.

573
00:34:47,319 --> 00:34:49,753
And Bucky is gonna
get us there extra fast.

574
00:34:49,755 --> 00:34:52,656
Bucky? Seems like a Bucky to me.

575
00:34:52,658 --> 00:34:54,858
Hit it, Bucky!

576
00:35:03,634 --> 00:35:05,735
Smurfette?

577
00:35:05,737 --> 00:35:09,106
Before you say anything,
just listen.

578
00:35:09,108 --> 00:35:11,074
Now, I know yesterday
I might have been

579
00:35:11,076 --> 00:35:13,810
a bit tough on you and the boys,

580
00:35:13,812 --> 00:35:17,180
and I know there are times
I'm a little overprotective.

581
00:35:20,151 --> 00:35:22,119
Okay, a lot overprotective.

582
00:35:22,121 --> 00:35:25,055
But you have to understand,
you snuck out.

583
00:35:25,057 --> 00:35:27,124
You have to be more careful.

584
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:36,433
Smurfette, I know
lately you may not realize,

585
00:35:36,435 --> 00:35:39,769
and I may not say it enough,
but you are...

586
00:35:42,874 --> 00:35:44,474
You shine.

587
00:35:47,079 --> 00:35:52,182
So, anyway, we're Smurfy?

588
00:35:52,184 --> 00:35:55,719
I think you and the boys have
been grounded long enough.

589
00:35:59,557 --> 00:36:01,458
Smurfette?

590
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:05,362
Okay. I'm opening the door.

591
00:36:05,364 --> 00:36:08,131
And I'm walking in to talk more.

592
00:36:09,234 --> 00:36:10,600
You there?

593
00:36:11,802 --> 00:36:13,370
Smurfette.

594
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:22,212
Hefty!

595
00:36:24,982 --> 00:36:26,349
Brainy!

596
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:33,256
Clumsy! Oh, that's
not even convincing.

597
00:36:33,258 --> 00:36:34,925
When I find those smurfs,

598
00:36:34,927 --> 00:36:38,495
I will ground them
for a month of blue moons.

599
00:36:38,497 --> 00:36:40,897
Oh, what's going on in here?

600
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:44,601
Hmm. Well, all right.

601
00:36:51,809 --> 00:36:55,145
Wow. Have you ever seen
something so beautiful?

602
00:36:55,147 --> 00:36:57,948
Every day, Smurfette.
Every day.

603
00:36:57,950 --> 00:37:00,550
- Don't be weird.
- You don't be weird.

604
00:37:05,623 --> 00:37:08,391
We can camp here for the night.

605
00:37:08,393 --> 00:37:10,794
I'll start us a fire.

606
00:37:10,796 --> 00:37:13,463
Uh, fetch me some firewood,
would you, hefty?

607
00:37:13,465 --> 00:37:15,565
Um, a "please" would be nice.

608
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:17,701
Yes, it would, but I haven't
earned my manners badge,

609
00:37:17,703 --> 00:37:19,302
so get me some firewood.

610
00:37:19,304 --> 00:37:21,271
Clumsy? You okay?

611
00:37:21,273 --> 00:37:23,707
Yeah, sure. It's been fun.

612
00:37:23,709 --> 00:37:27,143
Well, not tons of fun,
but it's had its moments.

613
00:37:27,145 --> 00:37:28,545
Kind of.

614
00:37:28,547 --> 00:37:31,414
You know what I'm trying to say.

615
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:33,683
It hasn't been that much fun.

616
00:37:36,721 --> 00:37:38,989
Well done, hefty.
Well done.

617
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:41,258
All right, step one,

618
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:45,762
the wood should be stacked
into a tepee-like structure.

619
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:49,599
Step two, I tap this
flint with a rock and...

620
00:37:58,509 --> 00:38:00,944
You're not even blowing on it.

621
00:38:00,946 --> 00:38:02,178
You're spitting on it.

622
00:38:04,182 --> 00:38:05,849
Hmm. That's odd.

623
00:38:05,851 --> 00:38:07,984
Perhaps the wood you
collected was damp, hefty.

624
00:38:07,986 --> 00:38:10,453
According to my manual,
it should spark right up.

625
00:38:11,922 --> 00:38:13,323
Hey, I've got an idea.

626
00:38:14,926 --> 00:38:17,560
No, no, no. No, no! No! No, no, no.
No, no, no!

627
00:38:17,562 --> 00:38:20,163
Oh, oh, oh... You know,
you're right, brain man.

628
00:38:20,165 --> 00:38:21,798
Your little book
does come in handy.

629
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:25,335
Shame. Shame on you. We'd
be lost without this book.

630
00:38:25,337 --> 00:38:26,903
My name is brainy.
I'm super smart.

631
00:38:26,905 --> 00:38:28,471
I'm the smart smurf.

632
00:38:28,473 --> 00:38:30,473
But I can't start a fire.

633
00:38:33,111 --> 00:38:36,112
Okay, the damage is minimal.
The binding's still intact.

634
00:38:36,114 --> 00:38:38,014
It smells good.

635
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:42,886
Just think, guys.

636
00:38:43,954 --> 00:38:45,455
After all this time,

637
00:38:45,457 --> 00:38:46,656
while we've been going about

638
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:48,291
our Smurfy business back home,

639
00:38:48,293 --> 00:38:51,695
there's been other smurfs
out there, just like us.

640
00:38:51,697 --> 00:38:54,864
Or they could be
nothing like us.

641
00:38:54,866 --> 00:38:58,668
He's right. We should be
prepared for whatever we find.

642
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:01,971
Those other smurfs
might not even be blue.

643
00:39:01,973 --> 00:39:04,507
Maybe they'll be orange.

644
00:39:04,509 --> 00:39:06,076
Ah. I like orange.

645
00:39:06,078 --> 00:39:08,578
What if they all wear glasses?

646
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:10,714
Or have big, bushy mustaches.

647
00:39:10,716 --> 00:39:14,651
What if they have scaly
skin and sharp teeth?

648
00:39:14,653 --> 00:39:18,254
And giant claws.
And big, beady eyes.

649
00:39:18,256 --> 00:39:21,257
What if they have hands?

650
00:39:22,394 --> 00:39:24,127
Good one, bro.

651
00:39:24,129 --> 00:39:27,797
Listen, it doesn't matter
what they look like.

652
00:39:27,799 --> 00:39:29,666
We still have to warn them.

653
00:39:32,103 --> 00:39:33,970
Gargamel's wrong about me.

654
00:39:37,441 --> 00:39:40,677
It's not my purpose to help him.

655
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:43,646
I'm meant to save those smurfs.

656
00:39:45,182 --> 00:39:46,750
And we're gonna help you.

657
00:39:46,752 --> 00:39:50,053
We're team smurf, and
we're in this together.

658
00:39:51,655 --> 00:39:54,090
And by "together,"
I mean me and you.

659
00:39:54,092 --> 00:39:56,960
And those guys.
But mostly me and you.

660
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:01,998
Okay, everyone.
Smurfy selfie time.

661
00:40:03,068 --> 00:40:04,434
Say, "blue cheese."

662
00:40:04,436 --> 00:40:06,035
Blue cheese!

663
00:40:13,277 --> 00:40:14,310
Whoa.

664
00:40:14,312 --> 00:40:15,512
According to the map,

665
00:40:15,514 --> 00:40:16,980
we should be
arriving at a river.

666
00:40:18,883 --> 00:40:19,983
Check.

667
00:40:20,951 --> 00:40:22,585
Wow.
Whoa.

668
00:40:22,587 --> 00:40:25,088
It's like a workout
for my eyeballs.

669
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:28,291
Okay, Bucky, let's see
how fast you can swim.

670
00:40:28,293 --> 00:40:29,359
Hyah!

671
00:40:29,361 --> 00:40:30,593
Whoa!
Whoa!

672
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:32,128
Come on, boy.

673
00:40:33,898 --> 00:40:35,265
You can do it.

674
00:40:36,735 --> 00:40:38,101
What's a little water?

675
00:40:39,204 --> 00:40:40,336
Hey.

676
00:40:43,174 --> 00:40:44,441
Uh-huh.

677
00:40:47,011 --> 00:40:48,178
What's that, Bucky?

678
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:49,612
The river's unsafe

679
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:51,815
and full of dangerous
surprises at every bend?

680
00:40:52,751 --> 00:40:54,684
No. I didn't
get any of that.

681
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,087
Perhaps Glowbunnies don't swim.

682
00:40:58,089 --> 00:41:00,657
That's too bad.
We'd get there so much faster.

683
00:41:00,659 --> 00:41:03,059
Fear not,
my intrepid team smurf.

684
00:41:03,061 --> 00:41:07,564
I didn't earn this raft-building
merit badge for nothing.

685
00:41:20,377 --> 00:41:22,178
Boom! Nailed it.

686
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:23,746
Impressive, brainy.

687
00:41:23,748 --> 00:41:25,648
Here.

688
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,250
Ooh.

689
00:41:27,252 --> 00:41:29,519
Stylish and practical.

690
00:41:29,521 --> 00:41:31,087
Now, let's launch this bad boy.

691
00:41:31,089 --> 00:41:32,989
Wait. Remember,
this strange river

692
00:41:32,991 --> 00:41:35,358
may hold untold surprises.

693
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,626
We must be cautious.

694
00:41:36,628 --> 00:41:37,861
Cautious. Good point.

695
00:41:37,863 --> 00:41:39,529
And heave...
Wait.

696
00:41:39,531 --> 00:41:40,763
The currents can
be unpredictable.

697
00:41:40,765 --> 00:41:42,465
We must be alert and vigilant.

698
00:41:42,467 --> 00:41:44,467
Vigilance? Good call.

699
00:41:44,469 --> 00:41:46,669
Now, on three, two...
Wait!

700
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:48,204
We must make sure we always...

701
00:41:48,206 --> 00:41:49,873
Bark, bark, bing, bang!

702
00:41:49,875 --> 00:41:51,808
Pay attention to the...
Bong, bong, bing, bang!

703
00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:53,076
Rate of speed of the...

704
00:41:53,078 --> 00:41:55,278
Berp, berp, bing,
dang, bong, bong!

705
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,614
Okay, and we are off.

706
00:41:57,616 --> 00:41:59,415
Heave-ho!

707
00:42:05,623 --> 00:42:06,789
Whoa!

708
00:42:06,791 --> 00:42:08,424
Bye, Bucky.
Thanks for your help.

709
00:42:08,426 --> 00:42:10,193
- Don't worry, we'll be fine.
- Bye, little Bucky bro.

710
00:42:10,195 --> 00:42:12,362
<i>Hasta la</i> bunny.
See you on the way back!

711
00:42:20,839 --> 00:42:23,840
Hey. What is this thing?

712
00:42:23,842 --> 00:42:26,276
I wouldn't touch that
if I were you.

713
00:42:27,979 --> 00:42:31,180
Oh. Now all I want
to do is touch it.

714
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:36,553
At this pace, Gargamel
doesn't stand a chance.

715
00:42:42,259 --> 00:42:44,827
Look. If we follow this river,
we'll be right on course.

716
00:42:44,829 --> 00:42:46,195
Right on course.
Huh?

717
00:42:46,197 --> 00:42:47,764
To the end of our rainbow.

718
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:52,869
Smurfs? I thought
I left you for dead.

719
00:42:52,871 --> 00:42:54,737
Hang on, smurf crew.

720
00:42:56,473 --> 00:42:57,974
Gun it!

721
00:43:04,548 --> 00:43:05,815
What the...

722
00:43:06,517 --> 00:43:07,984
No.

723
00:43:09,186 --> 00:43:11,454
Whoa!
Stop ruining things.

724
00:43:11,456 --> 00:43:13,756
Ruining things is my thing.

725
00:43:14,491 --> 00:43:15,625
What?

726
00:43:15,627 --> 00:43:17,527
Azrael, get me a bigger stick.

727
00:43:17,529 --> 00:43:18,795
Whoa!

728
00:43:20,564 --> 00:43:22,398
Oh, dear.

729
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,033
Clumsy, pull the lever!

730
00:43:24,035 --> 00:43:26,836
Seriously? But you said not to.
Is this a trick?

731
00:43:26,838 --> 00:43:28,338
Pull it now!

732
00:43:41,385 --> 00:43:42,619
Oh, no.

733
00:43:42,621 --> 00:43:44,153
Whoa!

734
00:43:46,658 --> 00:43:49,359
Whoa, whoa...

735
00:43:50,428 --> 00:43:51,894
Huh? What's this?

736
00:43:51,896 --> 00:43:54,097
Aah! Azrael!

737
00:43:54,099 --> 00:43:56,199
Do something.
It's never gonna stop.

738
00:43:56,201 --> 00:44:00,436
Make the log stop spinning.
This river is killing me.

739
00:44:03,073 --> 00:44:04,674
Whoa, whoa!

740
00:44:04,676 --> 00:44:06,175
Look out!

741
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:08,478
Whoa!
Whoa!

742
00:44:10,148 --> 00:44:11,648
I love you two.

743
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:15,084
Yes! We did it!
We did it!

744
00:44:15,086 --> 00:44:17,453
See, I always believed we would do it.
Take that!

745
00:44:17,455 --> 00:44:19,722
Help! Help!

746
00:44:19,724 --> 00:44:22,291
All right.
We're still on course.

747
00:44:22,293 --> 00:44:23,559
Double-time it, hefty.

748
00:44:23,561 --> 00:44:28,831
Help! I'm sinking!
Please. I'm afraid of turtles!

749
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:31,901
Uh, guys, what's he up to now?

750
00:44:31,903 --> 00:44:33,736
Help!
Forget that guy.

751
00:44:33,738 --> 00:44:35,271
My cat can't swim.

752
00:44:39,377 --> 00:44:40,977
We gotta help him.

753
00:44:40,979 --> 00:44:42,679
Are you crazy? Why?

754
00:44:42,681 --> 00:44:45,148
Because it's what I do.

755
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:46,082
Listen to him!

756
00:44:46,084 --> 00:44:47,984
But he's our sworn enemy.

757
00:44:47,986 --> 00:44:49,819
He is literally a villain.

758
00:44:49,821 --> 00:44:51,454
I can change!

759
00:44:51,456 --> 00:44:54,624
And I literally wear my
heart on my sleeve, okay?

760
00:44:54,626 --> 00:44:55,892
That's your shoulder,
not a sleeve.

761
00:44:55,894 --> 00:44:57,326
I like your tattoo!

762
00:44:57,328 --> 00:44:58,594
We're doing this.

763
00:44:58,596 --> 00:45:01,531
Smurfette, talk some
sense into him.

764
00:45:01,533 --> 00:45:05,868
Brainy, I hate Gargamel more
than anyone, but we're smurfs.

765
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:07,136
We do the right thing.

766
00:45:07,138 --> 00:45:08,571
Thank goodness for it!

767
00:45:08,573 --> 00:45:09,906
And we have to save him.

768
00:45:09,908 --> 00:45:11,140
I just want to go on record

769
00:45:11,142 --> 00:45:12,809
that I'm decisively
against this.

770
00:45:12,811 --> 00:45:14,844
Whatever. We're doing it.

771
00:45:14,846 --> 00:45:16,145
Sounds awesome!

772
00:45:17,682 --> 00:45:20,016
Use this.
Grab on!

773
00:45:24,355 --> 00:45:25,788
I don't know about this.

774
00:45:25,790 --> 00:45:27,557
You won't regret it.

775
00:45:27,559 --> 00:45:31,194
Oh, thank you. Thank you.
Such a kind smurf.

776
00:45:31,196 --> 00:45:33,429
Are you okay?
Oh, I'm okay.

777
00:45:33,431 --> 00:45:35,998
Wet, a little tired,
kind of waterlogged.

778
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,533
Thanks for asking, but...

779
00:45:37,535 --> 00:45:39,535
I'm still evil, so...

780
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:42,705
Enjoy drowning.

781
00:45:43,775 --> 00:45:45,174
Hope you're better swimmers

782
00:45:45,176 --> 00:45:48,411
than you are judges
of wizards' character.

783
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:51,781
Whoa! Whoa!

784
00:46:13,403 --> 00:46:15,805
Brainy. Hefty?

785
00:46:17,675 --> 00:46:18,975
You okay?

786
00:46:18,977 --> 00:46:21,444
Define "okay."

787
00:46:21,446 --> 00:46:22,779
Where's clumsy?
Clumsy!

788
00:46:22,781 --> 00:46:24,614
Clumsy! Clumsy!
Clumsy!

789
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:30,686
I'm good.

790
00:46:30,688 --> 00:46:32,822
Run away! Run away!
Hey.

791
00:46:33,357 --> 00:46:35,091
I think.

792
00:46:37,028 --> 00:46:40,897
My pack! My manual!
No! No, no, no! No, no, no!

793
00:46:40,899 --> 00:46:43,366
My scout manual!

794
00:46:47,037 --> 00:46:49,872
This is all your fault!

795
00:46:49,874 --> 00:46:52,275
What?
Brainy, cut it out.

796
00:46:52,277 --> 00:46:54,977
Oh, I'm sorry. Correction.
This is your fault, too.

797
00:46:54,979 --> 00:46:56,479
Leave her out of this.

798
00:46:56,481 --> 00:46:58,114
Hefty, I don't need you
to fight my fights for me.

799
00:46:58,116 --> 00:47:00,016
Wait, now you're mad at me, too?

800
00:47:00,018 --> 00:47:01,818
Smurfette, you're the one

801
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:03,986
that got us into this whole
mess in the first place.

802
00:47:03,988 --> 00:47:06,389
Hey, I was ready
to do this on my own.

803
00:47:06,391 --> 00:47:08,991
Great.
So much for team smurf.

804
00:47:08,993 --> 00:47:10,660
I want to yell about something!

805
00:47:10,662 --> 00:47:12,562
Stay out of this, clumsy.

806
00:47:12,564 --> 00:47:14,964
That's it, brain man. It's time for
you to earn your manners badge.

807
00:47:14,966 --> 00:47:16,365
Stop it!

808
00:47:18,635 --> 00:47:20,002
Take cover!

809
00:47:20,604 --> 00:47:21,871
Whoa!

810
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:37,987
Huh?

811
00:48:03,882 --> 00:48:05,915
Who are you?
What do you want?

812
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:08,050
Her.

813
00:48:09,253 --> 00:48:10,319
Huh?

814
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:14,056
Move.
Smurfette!

815
00:48:14,058 --> 00:48:15,558
What should we do with her?

816
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:16,792
Look at that hair.

817
00:48:16,794 --> 00:48:18,294
Where's she from?
And that dress.

818
00:48:27,971 --> 00:48:30,172
It's you.

819
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:36,412
You're a girl.

820
00:48:36,414 --> 00:48:37,613
She's a girl.

821
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:41,317
Oh.

822
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:43,586
Oh.

823
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:47,223
Oh.

824
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,127
This is her.

825
00:48:51,129 --> 00:48:52,895
This is the smurf
I was telling you about.

826
00:48:52,897 --> 00:48:55,531
The one from the wall?

827
00:48:55,533 --> 00:48:57,533
She's real?

828
00:48:58,435 --> 00:48:59,936
I'm Smurflily.

829
00:49:00,704 --> 00:49:03,639
Hi. I'm Smurfette.

830
00:49:03,641 --> 00:49:06,375
Oh, my geez-to-petes!
I'm Smurfblossom.

831
00:49:06,377 --> 00:49:08,411
Nice to meet you. We
don't have a Smurfette.

832
00:49:08,413 --> 00:49:10,680
But we do have
Smurfpetal, Smurfclover,

833
00:49:10,682 --> 00:49:12,581
Smurfmeadow, Smurfdaisy,
Smurfholly, Smurfhazel...

834
00:49:12,583 --> 00:49:13,749
Hey.

835
00:49:13,751 --> 00:49:15,451
Oh, everyone can just
introduce themselves later.

836
00:49:15,453 --> 00:49:18,154
Look at you.
You're so different.

837
00:49:18,156 --> 00:49:19,855
I mean, sorry, but it's true.

838
00:49:19,857 --> 00:49:21,157
Do you know how to start a fire

839
00:49:21,159 --> 00:49:22,258
with just rope and a stick?

840
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:23,592
I do. I can show you.

841
00:49:23,594 --> 00:49:25,394
Actually, Smurfstorm
can show you.

842
00:49:25,396 --> 00:49:28,297
She's the best at that kind of thing.
Right, stormy?

843
00:49:32,602 --> 00:49:33,803
That means "yes."

844
00:49:33,805 --> 00:49:35,004
Have you ever seen a rainbow?

845
00:49:35,006 --> 00:49:36,339
What about a double rainbow?

846
00:49:36,341 --> 00:49:39,141
What about an upside
down rainbow?

847
00:49:39,143 --> 00:49:40,743
So, is your favorite song...

848
00:49:43,748 --> 00:49:46,382
'Cause mine is.
Your dress is so pretty.

849
00:49:46,384 --> 00:49:49,418
Smurfblossom, remember,
work on that filter, okay?

850
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:50,920
Right.
Filter, filter.

851
00:49:50,922 --> 00:49:53,255
What's your deal anyway?

852
00:49:53,257 --> 00:49:56,192
Oh, well, we came to
warn you about Gargamel.

853
00:49:56,194 --> 00:49:57,693
Garga?
Garga?

854
00:49:57,695 --> 00:49:59,195
Garga-what?

855
00:49:59,197 --> 00:50:01,263
He's a dangerous wizard who
wants to capture all smurfs

856
00:50:01,265 --> 00:50:03,265
and use them for his evil magic.

857
00:50:03,267 --> 00:50:05,534
And he knows about
your lost village.

858
00:50:05,536 --> 00:50:07,136
"Lost village"?

859
00:50:08,439 --> 00:50:10,606
You're the ones
who are lost, not us.

860
00:50:12,877 --> 00:50:15,277
We have to take you
to Smurfy grove.

861
00:50:15,279 --> 00:50:19,048
What do we do with
these blue blobs?

862
00:50:19,050 --> 00:50:20,816
Oh, um...

863
00:50:20,818 --> 00:50:22,184
Bring them along.

864
00:50:22,186 --> 00:50:24,253
Come on, Smurfette. I'm
gonna show you my room.

865
00:50:24,255 --> 00:50:25,988
You can tell me
all about Gargasmell.

866
00:50:25,990 --> 00:50:28,110
But first, do you want to
hear my favorite song again?

867
00:50:30,595 --> 00:50:31,961
All right, move.

868
00:50:31,963 --> 00:50:33,062
Dang!

869
00:50:33,064 --> 00:50:34,964
Girl smurfs mean business.

870
00:50:34,966 --> 00:50:36,732
You got that right.

871
00:50:50,914 --> 00:50:52,648
Open the gate!

872
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:56,085
The girls are back!

873
00:51:17,808 --> 00:51:20,342
Ew! Where did
they find them?

874
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:24,146
Is there something
wrong with them?

875
00:51:24,148 --> 00:51:26,348
Are they sick?
Are they food?

876
00:51:26,350 --> 00:51:28,651
No, no, no. They're
smurfs, just like us.

877
00:51:28,653 --> 00:51:31,253
Except, well,
they're boy smurfs.

878
00:51:31,255 --> 00:51:36,292
"Boy." That's a funny word.
Boy. Boy. Boy. Boy.

879
00:51:36,294 --> 00:51:39,428
Look at me.
I'm a boy smurf.

880
00:51:40,898 --> 00:51:42,631
I like 'em. Where
do they come from?

881
00:51:42,633 --> 00:51:44,333
- What is that?
- Where is their hair?

882
00:51:44,335 --> 00:51:45,734
- You can see their tails.
- Oh, look.

883
00:51:45,736 --> 00:51:47,269
Hey, watch it!
Brainy's log, day two.

884
00:51:47,271 --> 00:51:48,471
We've encountered
a rare new life-form.

885
00:51:48,473 --> 00:51:49,738
Are there more like you?

886
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:51,340
They are at times
very intimidating.

887
00:51:51,342 --> 00:51:52,408
Are you gonna stay here?

888
00:51:52,410 --> 00:51:54,009
And they smell nice.

889
00:51:54,011 --> 00:51:55,544
Hello, boy.
More on that later.

890
00:51:55,546 --> 00:51:57,146
Oh, I want one!
Boundaries!

891
00:51:57,148 --> 00:51:59,615
Okay, that...
That's enough of that!

892
00:51:59,617 --> 00:52:02,651
They're my friends. That's
hefty, brainy and clumsy.

893
00:52:02,653 --> 00:52:04,620
Hey, there!
Hooptie, Berney, Klutzy.

894
00:52:04,622 --> 00:52:05,621
Got it.

895
00:52:05,623 --> 00:52:07,089
We should do name tags.

896
00:52:07,091 --> 00:52:09,225
Wait, where are your boys?

897
00:52:09,227 --> 00:52:11,694
You won't find any boys here.

898
00:52:34,251 --> 00:52:37,686
I am Smurfwillow,
leader of the smurfs.

899
00:52:42,125 --> 00:52:46,195
This is called an introduction.
So, now, you go.

900
00:52:48,166 --> 00:52:49,598
Uh, I, um...

901
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:51,200
Don't get too close, Willow.

902
00:52:51,202 --> 00:52:53,102
Something's not right here.

903
00:52:53,104 --> 00:52:56,272
I promise we're
only here to help.

904
00:52:56,274 --> 00:52:59,542
We came to warn you about
the evil wizard, Gargamel.

905
00:52:59,544 --> 00:53:01,277
He has a map with a landmark

906
00:53:01,279 --> 00:53:03,145
leading him to three tall trees.

907
00:53:03,147 --> 00:53:05,347
Show 'em, brainy.
Snappy.

908
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:10,486
Don't try any funny stuff, bug.

909
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:24,433
I hate to break it to you,
but those aren't trees.

910
00:53:32,976 --> 00:53:35,544
They're waterfalls.

911
00:53:35,546 --> 00:53:37,546
Gargamel's going the wrong way.

912
00:53:37,548 --> 00:53:39,515
And if he went there,

913
00:53:39,517 --> 00:53:43,352
then that means the
swamp of no return.

914
00:53:43,354 --> 00:53:45,955
There's no way he could survive.

915
00:53:45,957 --> 00:53:48,524
Aah! Help me! Help me!

916
00:53:49,526 --> 00:53:52,661
There's no way I'll survive!

917
00:53:52,663 --> 00:53:56,799
With all due respect,
you don't know Gargamel.

918
00:53:56,801 --> 00:54:01,070
Yeah, well, with no due
respect, you don't know us.

919
00:54:01,072 --> 00:54:02,838
Trust us, he's a goner.

920
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:06,742
Stormy, why don't you do a little recon?
Check things out.

921
00:54:06,744 --> 00:54:08,877
And leave you here
with these four?

922
00:54:08,879 --> 00:54:11,080
No way.
Look at that one.

923
00:54:11,082 --> 00:54:12,748
Huh?
He can't be normal.

924
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:15,251
I think we'll be just fine here.

925
00:54:17,554 --> 00:54:19,555
Spitfire!

926
00:54:30,967 --> 00:54:33,802
Okay. So, what does
this Gargamel look like?

927
00:54:33,804 --> 00:54:36,705
Oh, you know,
he's your typical wizard.

928
00:54:36,707 --> 00:54:40,309
Long black robe, lives alone
with his cat and his bird.

929
00:54:40,311 --> 00:54:41,810
It's sad, really.

930
00:54:41,812 --> 00:54:43,946
You're coming with me.
You can point him out.

931
00:54:43,948 --> 00:54:46,715
Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa. There's
no way he's getting on a...

932
00:54:48,119 --> 00:54:52,054
I feel the need to remind
you, my name is clumsy.

933
00:54:53,324 --> 00:54:54,556
Clumsy!

934
00:54:54,558 --> 00:54:56,859
Don't worry.
Clumsy's in good hands.

935
00:54:56,861 --> 00:55:00,329
Oh, stormy is the
sweetest, in her own way.

936
00:55:00,331 --> 00:55:02,498
All right, girls,
in the meantime,

937
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:04,033
our guests have
had a long journey,

938
00:55:04,035 --> 00:55:09,138
so let's show them some
hospitality, Smurfy grove style.

939
00:55:11,675 --> 00:55:13,075
Whoo-hoo!

940
00:55:23,821 --> 00:55:24,821
Come on.

941
00:55:26,357 --> 00:55:27,823
Huh?

942
00:55:27,825 --> 00:55:29,091
Go.

943
00:55:40,071 --> 00:55:42,705
Hey, Smurfette, check this out.

944
00:55:51,214 --> 00:55:52,715
Come on!

945
00:56:48,706 --> 00:56:50,038
Whoa!

946
00:57:06,323 --> 00:57:08,757
Flap, Monty.
Flap vigorously.

947
00:57:08,759 --> 00:57:10,626
Use your mighty condor wings

948
00:57:10,628 --> 00:57:13,128
to carry your master to safety.

949
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:14,997
Ouch! Oh! Ow!

950
00:57:14,999 --> 00:57:17,933
Sweet mercy,
they're bottom feeders!

951
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:24,606
Devil fish!

952
00:57:24,608 --> 00:57:27,876
Where is my lost smurf village?

953
00:57:27,878 --> 00:57:30,179
Huh?

954
00:57:32,515 --> 00:57:35,951
What? Smurfs!

955
00:57:35,953 --> 00:57:38,454
Why won't they just die?

956
00:57:38,456 --> 00:57:40,756
Monty, retrieve them!

957
00:57:40,758 --> 00:57:42,491
He exists, all right.

958
00:57:42,493 --> 00:57:44,960
He and his stinky cat
and his dodo bird.

959
00:57:44,962 --> 00:57:47,763
They've been terrorizing
us the entire journey.

960
00:57:47,765 --> 00:57:49,631
He didn't like us
from the start.

961
00:57:49,633 --> 00:57:51,500
He never could find our village.

962
00:57:51,502 --> 00:57:54,069
So then he made
a plan to capture us all,

963
00:57:54,071 --> 00:57:56,672
and that's when Gargamel
created Smurfette.

964
00:57:56,674 --> 00:57:58,006
Anyways...
Hold up.

965
00:57:58,008 --> 00:58:01,009
Smurfette was created
by this Gargamel?

966
00:58:01,011 --> 00:58:02,945
Oh, yeah.
From a lump of Clay.

967
00:58:02,947 --> 00:58:04,313
Really cool story, actually.

968
00:58:04,315 --> 00:58:06,014
I knew I didn't trust her.

969
00:58:06,016 --> 00:58:07,983
Oh, you'd like her
if you get to know her.

970
00:58:07,985 --> 00:58:11,420
She's just like you, but nice.

971
00:58:11,422 --> 00:58:14,256
Hold on.
We got a bogey coming in.

972
00:58:14,258 --> 00:58:17,593
That's no bogey. That's
Gargamel's big dumb bird!

973
00:58:18,662 --> 00:58:19,962
Here, you fly.

974
00:58:19,964 --> 00:58:21,864
Uh, that's not a great idea.

975
00:58:21,866 --> 00:58:23,532
Flying's not really my thing.

976
00:58:23,534 --> 00:58:25,200
Have you ever flown before?

977
00:58:25,202 --> 00:58:26,768
Well, no.

978
00:58:26,770 --> 00:58:29,571
Well, then how do you
know it's not your thing?

979
00:58:29,573 --> 00:58:31,807
He's coming back.

980
00:58:31,809 --> 00:58:33,375
Uh... oh, what do I...

981
00:58:33,377 --> 00:58:34,409
Hurry!

982
00:58:34,411 --> 00:58:36,178
What do I do now?

983
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:38,046
Oh! Good move!
Whoa, whoa!

984
00:58:38,048 --> 00:58:39,414
Now, do it again!

985
00:58:39,416 --> 00:58:40,983
Okay.

986
00:58:40,985 --> 00:58:42,251
Thanks.

987
00:58:44,355 --> 00:58:45,888
Hyah! Oh!

988
00:58:49,959 --> 00:58:50,826
Whoa!

989
00:58:50,828 --> 00:58:53,762
Yes. Wait a minute.

990
00:58:54,998 --> 00:58:57,866
I don't recognize
that other smurf.

991
00:59:01,939 --> 00:59:05,173
They found
my lost smurf village.

992
00:59:16,653 --> 00:59:18,120
Hey, I've got an idea.

993
00:59:18,122 --> 00:59:20,822
Spitfire, spit fire!

994
00:59:21,758 --> 00:59:23,692
I like the way you think.

995
00:59:23,694 --> 00:59:27,329
I guess I'm pretty good
with dragonflies after all.

996
00:59:37,941 --> 00:59:39,308
Monty!

997
00:59:39,310 --> 00:59:42,210
What have they done to you,
my glorious bird of prey?

998
00:59:45,249 --> 00:59:49,284
Smurfs!

999
00:59:58,027 --> 01:00:00,596
Hmm?

1000
01:00:08,371 --> 01:00:09,471
Hmm.

1001
01:00:09,473 --> 01:00:11,373
Shiatsu or Swedish?

1002
01:00:12,208 --> 01:00:13,342
Probably Swedish.

1003
01:00:21,484 --> 01:00:23,819
So, about all that stuff

1004
01:00:23,821 --> 01:00:25,821
I said back at the beach...

1005
01:00:25,823 --> 01:00:28,724
I guess I kind of overreacted.

1006
01:00:29,926 --> 01:00:30,993
Ow.

1007
01:00:31,594 --> 01:00:33,729
Yeah. Me, too.

1008
01:00:34,397 --> 01:00:36,665
So, uh, we good?

1009
01:00:36,667 --> 01:00:39,134
- Yeah, we're good.
- Hey, guys.

1010
01:00:45,341 --> 01:00:47,409
Isn't this place awesome?

1011
01:00:48,444 --> 01:00:50,112
Doesn't she look great?

1012
01:00:50,114 --> 01:00:52,114
It's like she's one of us now.

1013
01:00:52,116 --> 01:00:54,449
She should stay with us forever.

1014
01:00:56,086 --> 01:00:58,153
Uh, one, she always looks great.

1015
01:00:58,155 --> 01:01:01,757
And two, this is getting a little
out of hand, don't you think?

1016
01:01:01,759 --> 01:01:03,325
Sorry.

1017
01:01:03,327 --> 01:01:06,428
I can't take you seriously
with that mask on your face.

1018
01:01:09,465 --> 01:01:12,701
Hey, Smurfette, we did
what we came here to do.

1019
01:01:12,703 --> 01:01:14,269
These smurfs
know about Gargamel.

1020
01:01:14,271 --> 01:01:17,439
So, come on, let's start
thinking about heading home.

1021
01:01:17,441 --> 01:01:18,707
Home?

1022
01:01:19,442 --> 01:01:21,877
But I... I...

1023
01:01:21,879 --> 01:01:23,311
It's time to go.

1024
01:01:27,183 --> 01:01:28,483
Smurfette?

1025
01:01:28,485 --> 01:01:30,352
Incoming!

1026
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:39,261
Turns out I do do well
with dragonflies.

1027
01:01:39,263 --> 01:01:42,464
They were right. This Gargamel
character, he's real,

1028
01:01:42,466 --> 01:01:43,699
and he's headed this way.

1029
01:01:43,701 --> 01:01:45,634
Oh, no. See? I told you...

1030
01:01:45,636 --> 01:01:47,269
Put a cork in it, Smurfette.

1031
01:01:47,271 --> 01:01:49,705
The way I see it, you and
your little boyfriends

1032
01:01:49,707 --> 01:01:51,440
led him straight to us.

1033
01:01:51,442 --> 01:01:53,442
But, of course, that was your
plan all along, wasn't it?

1034
01:01:53,444 --> 01:01:56,011
Smurfstorm, easy.

1035
01:01:56,013 --> 01:01:58,947
Little miss yellow hair
isn't even a real smurf.

1036
01:01:58,949 --> 01:02:01,383
She was created by Gargamel.

1037
01:02:01,385 --> 01:02:03,919
The clumsy blob
told me so himself.

1038
01:02:03,921 --> 01:02:05,320
What?

1039
01:02:05,322 --> 01:02:07,856
Smurfette, is that true?

1040
01:02:07,858 --> 01:02:10,025
It's not like that.

1041
01:02:10,027 --> 01:02:12,294
She was made to
help him find smurfs.

1042
01:02:12,296 --> 01:02:15,163
Smurfette came here
to help you. We all did.

1043
01:02:15,165 --> 01:02:18,433
It's okay, hefty.
This is all my fault.

1044
01:02:21,739 --> 01:02:23,839
Girls, protection mode.

1045
01:02:26,009 --> 01:02:27,843
Come on, bro, let's help.

1046
01:02:51,667 --> 01:02:53,335
Isn't this exciting?

1047
01:02:53,337 --> 01:02:54,402
Shh!

1048
01:02:56,539 --> 01:02:57,906
Hold.

1049
01:03:00,143 --> 01:03:01,443
Hold.

1050
01:03:04,147 --> 01:03:05,247
Now!

1051
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:11,787
Surrender, wizard.

1052
01:03:11,789 --> 01:03:13,321
What? Wizard?

1053
01:03:13,323 --> 01:03:16,057
Oh, he's so old.

1054
01:03:16,059 --> 01:03:17,793
Is he wearing a disguise?
Look at his face.

1055
01:03:17,795 --> 01:03:19,227
This is impossible.

1056
01:03:19,229 --> 01:03:20,962
He doesn't seem so tough.

1057
01:03:20,964 --> 01:03:22,397
Yeah, Gargamel!

1058
01:03:22,399 --> 01:03:24,299
That's what you get when
you attack Smurfy grove.

1059
01:03:24,301 --> 01:03:26,234
Gargamel?
What are you talking about?

1060
01:03:26,236 --> 01:03:28,069
No, no, no, wait.
This is a mistake.

1061
01:03:28,071 --> 01:03:29,471
What?
Smurfette?

1062
01:03:29,473 --> 01:03:30,806
That's papa.

1063
01:03:30,808 --> 01:03:32,741
Papa?
Papa?

1064
01:03:32,743 --> 01:03:34,442
There's another funny word.

1065
01:03:34,444 --> 01:03:37,379
Papa. Papa. Papa!

1066
01:03:37,381 --> 01:03:38,947
Smurfblossom, no.

1067
01:03:38,949 --> 01:03:40,682
Breathe deep and step away

1068
01:03:40,684 --> 01:03:41,783
from the papa-thing.

1069
01:03:41,785 --> 01:03:44,519
Everyone, meet papa smurf.

1070
01:03:46,355 --> 01:03:47,722
Hey.

1071
01:03:47,724 --> 01:03:49,991
Hey.
Hi. I'm Ssmurfjade.

1072
01:03:53,296 --> 01:03:54,830
Where are the boys?

1073
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:57,899
'Sup, papa?

1074
01:03:57,901 --> 01:03:59,467
Hello there.

1075
01:03:59,469 --> 01:04:00,769
I rode a dragonfly!

1076
01:04:00,771 --> 01:04:04,606
Well, thank goodness
you're all okay.

1077
01:04:04,608 --> 01:04:06,341
How did you find us?

1078
01:04:06,343 --> 01:04:08,944
I wasn't
born yesterday, you know.

1079
01:04:08,946 --> 01:04:10,278
Yeah, that's clear.

1080
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:14,015
Look, you four are coming
home with me. Now.

1081
01:04:14,017 --> 01:04:15,584
Not so fast,
papa-thing.

1082
01:04:15,586 --> 01:04:18,753
"Papa-thing"? Are you
the one in charge here?

1083
01:04:18,755 --> 01:04:20,789
That's right.
I'm Smurfwillow,

1084
01:04:20,791 --> 01:04:22,123
leader of the smurfs.

1085
01:04:22,125 --> 01:04:23,758
I'm afraid that's
quite impossible,

1086
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:25,827
because I happen to be
the leader of the smurfs.

1087
01:04:25,829 --> 01:04:27,529
Whatever you say,
papa-thing.

1088
01:04:27,531 --> 01:04:30,031
Excuse me, do you
mind not calling me that?

1089
01:04:30,033 --> 01:04:32,133
Well, if the thing fits...

1090
01:04:32,135 --> 01:04:35,003
By the way, where'd
you learn those moves?

1091
01:04:35,005 --> 01:04:36,538
Self-taught, actually.

1092
01:04:36,540 --> 01:04:37,772
Impressive.

1093
01:04:37,774 --> 01:04:38,874
Thank you.

1094
01:04:38,876 --> 01:04:40,709
You're quite welcome.

1095
01:04:40,711 --> 01:04:43,545
Okay, not really sure
what's happening here,

1096
01:04:43,547 --> 01:04:45,380
but, uh, what about Gargamel?

1097
01:04:45,382 --> 01:04:48,350
What? What is all
this talk about Garga...

1098
01:04:50,854 --> 01:04:51,987
Gargamel!

1099
01:04:51,989 --> 01:04:54,522
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did I scare you?

1100
01:04:54,524 --> 01:04:56,591
No!
I hope so.

1101
01:04:56,593 --> 01:04:58,526
- Everybody run!
- Arm yourselves!

1102
01:04:58,528 --> 01:05:01,563
Prepare for Garmageddon!

1103
01:05:03,934 --> 01:05:05,667
This way!

1104
01:05:11,541 --> 01:05:13,241
Spears, now!

1105
01:05:13,243 --> 01:05:15,510
Gargamel says freeze!

1106
01:05:16,747 --> 01:05:19,514
That's right. Smurf-tested,
Gargamel-approved,

1107
01:05:19,516 --> 01:05:22,884
grade-a, first-class,
high-octane freeze balls.

1108
01:05:22,886 --> 01:05:25,887
Freeze ball! Freeze ball!
Freeze ball! Freeze ball!

1109
01:05:25,889 --> 01:05:27,589
Look out!

1110
01:05:29,927 --> 01:05:31,459
Well, I assume
they'll still work

1111
01:05:31,461 --> 01:05:33,161
if I don't shout "freeze ball,"

1112
01:05:33,163 --> 01:05:34,996
but we'll never know.

1113
01:05:34,998 --> 01:05:37,599
- Freeze ball!
- Smurfette!

1114
01:05:46,442 --> 01:05:47,575
Hefty.

1115
01:05:47,577 --> 01:05:48,977
It's over, Smurfette.

1116
01:05:50,380 --> 01:05:53,014
Monty, bag o' smurfs. Ah!

1117
01:05:53,016 --> 01:05:55,750
It's time for you to run.

1118
01:05:55,752 --> 01:05:57,886
No!
Three more for pickup.

1119
01:06:02,224 --> 01:06:05,427
Ah, Smurfette.
My little creation.

1120
01:06:05,429 --> 01:06:08,763
You finally did
what you were made for.

1121
01:06:08,765 --> 01:06:10,999
No. It's not true.

1122
01:06:11,001 --> 01:06:12,233
Of course it is.

1123
01:06:12,235 --> 01:06:14,169
Why do you think
you led me here?

1124
01:06:14,171 --> 01:06:17,405
Why do you think you
saved me on the river?

1125
01:06:17,407 --> 01:06:20,542
It was all part of the plan.

1126
01:06:21,911 --> 01:06:27,349
No matter how hard you try,
you can't escape your destiny.

1127
01:06:28,585 --> 01:06:30,719
And now, you're really
of no use to me anymore.

1128
01:06:30,721 --> 01:06:32,654
Freeze ball!

1129
01:06:35,358 --> 01:06:40,328
Ah, yes, these freeze balls
only work on real smurfs.

1130
01:06:40,330 --> 01:06:43,598
And you are nothing more
than a lump of Clay.

1131
01:06:44,734 --> 01:06:47,535
Thank you for everything.

1132
01:06:47,537 --> 01:06:52,173
Smurfette? How could
you do this to us?

1133
01:06:52,175 --> 01:06:55,710
Because it was her purpose.

1134
01:07:39,188 --> 01:07:44,059
<i>Smurfy thing finder
for four small smurfs.</i>

1135
01:07:50,666 --> 01:07:52,233
Huh?

1136
01:08:26,268 --> 01:08:28,336
I'm sorry, you guys.

1137
01:08:39,882 --> 01:08:41,449
No, snappy.

1138
01:08:41,451 --> 01:08:43,751
I've done too much
damage already.

1139
01:08:48,591 --> 01:08:51,726
<i>We're team smurf,
and we're in this together.</i>

1140
01:08:55,198 --> 01:08:58,166
<i>- We're smurfs.
- We do the right thing.</i>

1141
01:08:59,502 --> 01:09:01,870
I'm not even a real smurf.

1142
01:09:03,906 --> 01:09:07,709
I'm not a real smurf.

1143
01:09:10,614 --> 01:09:13,781
We need more power!

1144
01:09:15,085 --> 01:09:18,486
- Faster, Monty.
- Faster.

1145
01:09:18,488 --> 01:09:19,721
Yes.

1146
01:09:19,723 --> 01:09:21,289
The jiggler's jiggling.

1147
01:09:21,291 --> 01:09:23,158
The spinny thing is spinning.

1148
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:24,392
The smoke is going up.

1149
01:09:24,394 --> 01:09:26,294
The bubblers are bubbling.

1150
01:09:26,296 --> 01:09:27,562
Hubbuda, Hubbuda.

1151
01:09:27,564 --> 01:09:28,429
Perfect!

1152
01:09:28,431 --> 01:09:31,499
Oh, it's almost there.

1153
01:09:31,501 --> 01:09:34,035
Just keep running, old bird.

1154
01:09:35,238 --> 01:09:36,938
Here's what we're going to do.

1155
01:09:36,940 --> 01:09:39,207
I pick this lock.
Yeah?

1156
01:09:39,209 --> 01:09:41,609
We swing to that shelf.
Yeah?

1157
01:09:41,611 --> 01:09:43,678
Pick up something heavy.
Yeah?

1158
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:46,147
And use it to kill the bird!

1159
01:09:46,149 --> 01:09:47,448
Yeah! What?
Yeah! Wait.

1160
01:09:47,450 --> 01:09:49,417
You want us to kill the bird?

1161
01:09:49,419 --> 01:09:51,619
Fine. We'll just
knock him unconscious.

1162
01:09:51,621 --> 01:09:53,221
Genius!
All right, then.

1163
01:09:53,223 --> 01:09:54,422
Let's do this.

1164
01:09:54,424 --> 01:09:56,224
They have an escape plan,

1165
01:09:56,226 --> 01:09:57,492
but they're going
to need our help.

1166
01:09:57,494 --> 01:09:59,227
It's time to rock the cage.

1167
01:09:59,229 --> 01:10:01,095
Don't be weird.

1168
01:10:01,097 --> 01:10:02,530
Yes!

1169
01:10:09,605 --> 01:10:10,972
Okay. Now!

1170
01:10:20,150 --> 01:10:21,482
Stop that, Azrael.

1171
01:10:21,484 --> 01:10:22,717
I can't calibrate my machine

1172
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:24,719
with all your
incessant yammering.

1173
01:10:27,824 --> 01:10:31,326
Oh, yes, Azrael, listen to it.
It purrs like a kitten.

1174
01:10:36,066 --> 01:10:38,633
Oh, look at that.
Everything is in sync.

1175
01:10:39,134 --> 01:10:40,935
Yes, yes. Good.

1176
01:10:49,945 --> 01:10:52,780
Sweet mercy!
It's another jailbreak!

1177
01:10:55,517 --> 01:10:57,352
No, Gargamel. No.

1178
01:10:57,354 --> 01:10:59,120
Quiet down.

1179
01:10:59,122 --> 01:11:01,022
You'll all get your turn.

1180
01:11:01,024 --> 01:11:02,257
In you go!

1181
01:11:03,693 --> 01:11:05,693
No!

1182
01:11:07,463 --> 01:11:10,765
Yes, that's the stuff.

1183
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:21,409
Oh, I can feel it.
I can feel the power.

1184
01:11:21,411 --> 01:11:23,878
Oh!

1185
01:11:27,616 --> 01:11:30,285
Check out my wizard mane.

1186
01:11:30,287 --> 01:11:32,520
Really, man?

1187
01:11:32,522 --> 01:11:34,589
When I'm through
with these smurfs,

1188
01:11:34,591 --> 01:11:37,825
I'll have all the power
I've ever dreamed of!

1189
01:11:39,829 --> 01:11:42,430
Almost all the power.

1190
01:11:42,765 --> 01:11:43,831
Huh?

1191
01:11:45,401 --> 01:11:46,634
Smurfette.

1192
01:11:46,636 --> 01:11:49,704
Smurfette,
what a lovely surprise.

1193
01:11:49,706 --> 01:11:52,006
Are you done
crying in the woods?

1194
01:11:52,008 --> 01:11:56,177
I've shed enough tears
for those smurfs.

1195
01:11:56,179 --> 01:11:57,578
What's this?

1196
01:11:57,580 --> 01:12:00,014
I'm done pretending
to be something I'm not.

1197
01:12:00,016 --> 01:12:04,919
I've come to repledge my
loyalty to you, my true papa.

1198
01:12:06,723 --> 01:12:08,056
Impossible.

1199
01:12:08,058 --> 01:12:09,290
She can't be serious.

1200
01:12:09,292 --> 01:12:10,825
No, no, no, she would never.

1201
01:12:10,827 --> 01:12:14,228
Even if I did believe
you, which I don't,

1202
01:12:14,230 --> 01:12:16,030
what could you possibly offer me

1203
01:12:16,032 --> 01:12:17,465
that I don't already have?

1204
01:12:17,467 --> 01:12:20,368
A tiny little massage
that I can't even feel?

1205
01:12:20,370 --> 01:12:23,471
How about
the rest of the smurfs?

1206
01:12:23,473 --> 01:12:25,640
Yeah, right.
Wait, what?

1207
01:12:25,642 --> 01:12:28,009
Just think of all
the power you'll have

1208
01:12:28,011 --> 01:12:32,513
once I reveal the location
of smurf village.

1209
01:12:35,385 --> 01:12:37,719
Oh, let's see now.

1210
01:12:37,721 --> 01:12:39,921
One hundred more smurfs,
that's 10 times the power...

1211
01:12:39,923 --> 01:12:42,423
No. If you carry the one...

1212
01:12:42,425 --> 01:12:44,392
Whatever.
It's a lot more power.

1213
01:12:44,394 --> 01:12:47,462
Now, why are you doing this?

1214
01:12:47,464 --> 01:12:50,298
I'm so tired of being good.

1215
01:12:50,300 --> 01:12:52,600
Use your power to transform me

1216
01:12:52,602 --> 01:12:54,268
back to my evil self.

1217
01:12:55,638 --> 01:12:58,005
Your loyalty has
returned to you.

1218
01:12:58,007 --> 01:13:00,108
So, do we have a deal?

1219
01:13:00,110 --> 01:13:01,576
Smurfette, no!

1220
01:13:01,578 --> 01:13:03,878
Quiet, you vile blue rats.
I'm thinking.

1221
01:13:05,215 --> 01:13:07,482
Okay, I'm done.
Let's do it.

1222
01:13:07,484 --> 01:13:11,285
One evil Smurfette
coming right up!

1223
01:13:26,335 --> 01:13:28,536
Wait. Of course!

1224
01:13:29,672 --> 01:13:32,206
What? Oh,
what's happening?

1225
01:13:32,208 --> 01:13:34,409
No! No!

1226
01:13:34,411 --> 01:13:36,444
What are you doing?

1227
01:13:36,446 --> 01:13:38,813
Yeah! Go, Smurfette!
Whoo!

1228
01:13:41,083 --> 01:13:44,118
Azrael, help! More power!

1229
01:13:48,023 --> 01:13:50,825
What are we going to do?

1230
01:13:52,461 --> 01:13:54,996
Bingo. We Smurfboard.

1231
01:13:56,465 --> 01:13:58,733
Whoa!

1232
01:13:59,435 --> 01:14:02,036
Team smurf!

1233
01:14:02,038 --> 01:14:04,071
Payback time.

1234
01:14:18,353 --> 01:14:19,854
No!

1235
01:14:37,740 --> 01:14:40,141
Smurfintine!
Smurfintine!

1236
01:14:43,512 --> 01:14:45,480
We're free!

1237
01:14:50,553 --> 01:14:52,753
I'm okay. Yeah!

1238
01:14:52,755 --> 01:14:54,222
I thought we were goners.

1239
01:14:54,224 --> 01:14:56,224
All right. Everybody.
Thank goodness.

1240
01:14:56,226 --> 01:14:57,758
All right!
I'm okay!

1241
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:00,561
She did it!
She did it!

1242
01:15:00,563 --> 01:15:02,096
Where's Smurfette?

1243
01:15:02,865 --> 01:15:04,031
Hey.

1244
01:15:17,112 --> 01:15:18,246
Smurfette?

1245
01:15:24,353 --> 01:15:26,387
What happened?

1246
01:15:26,389 --> 01:15:28,656
This is what she once was.

1247
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:39,834
No. No, no, no.

1248
01:15:39,836 --> 01:15:41,702
There's gotta be
something I can do.

1249
01:15:41,704 --> 01:15:43,905
There's gotta be a spell.

1250
01:15:43,907 --> 01:15:46,574
There's gotta be something.
I know there is.

1251
01:15:46,576 --> 01:15:49,610
Where is it? What page?
Must be here.

1252
01:15:49,612 --> 01:15:51,178
"Alchemy, vanishing,

1253
01:15:51,180 --> 01:15:52,813
"lead into gold."
No, that's not it.

1254
01:15:52,815 --> 01:15:55,082
Papa. Which spell? Which spell?

1255
01:15:55,084 --> 01:15:56,584
Papa.

1256
01:15:56,586 --> 01:16:00,221
We won't find the answer
to this in a book.

1257
01:16:05,761 --> 01:16:07,762
Let's take her home.

1258
01:17:43,191 --> 01:17:46,060
She never thought
she was a real smurf.

1259
01:17:47,696 --> 01:17:50,831
But she was
the truest smurf of all.

1260
01:18:32,007 --> 01:18:35,009
Why is everyone crying?

1261
01:18:35,011 --> 01:18:36,944
It's Smurfette.

1262
01:18:36,946 --> 01:18:38,779
She's a lump of Clay.

1263
01:18:38,781 --> 01:18:42,483
No, clumsy, it's me.
I'm right here.

1264
01:18:43,485 --> 01:18:45,419
Smurfette?

1265
01:18:46,622 --> 01:18:49,356
It's Smurfette.
It's Smurfette!

1266
01:18:49,358 --> 01:18:50,624
Quiet, clumsy.

1267
01:18:50,626 --> 01:18:52,226
Let him be, brainy.

1268
01:18:52,228 --> 01:18:54,228
We all grieve in our own way.

1269
01:18:54,230 --> 01:18:56,197
She's here!
Poor little bro.

1270
01:18:56,199 --> 01:18:58,099
I know how he feels.

1271
01:18:58,101 --> 01:18:59,767
Yeah!

1272
01:18:59,769 --> 01:19:01,001
Smurfette!

1273
01:19:01,003 --> 01:19:04,004
Oh, hefty, not you, too.

1274
01:19:04,006 --> 01:19:05,940
You're all right!

1275
01:19:08,877 --> 01:19:10,878
Don't ever do that to me again.

1276
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:13,380
I won't. I promise.

1277
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:16,317
Huh?

1278
01:19:16,319 --> 01:19:17,885
Yes, yes, yes!

1279
01:19:30,199 --> 01:19:33,267
You never cease to amaze me.

1280
01:19:36,806 --> 01:19:40,007
<i>So, as for that
burning question...</i>

1281
01:19:40,009 --> 01:19:41,609
What's a Smurfette?

1282
01:19:41,611 --> 01:19:44,945
Well, I don't need a book
to tell you she's...

1283
01:19:44,947 --> 01:19:46,480
Right.

1284
01:19:46,482 --> 01:19:49,950
Smurfette can't be defined
by just one word.

1285
01:19:49,952 --> 01:19:51,585
She's many things.

1286
01:19:51,587 --> 01:19:54,355
Oh, she doesn't know it yet,
but she's my new best friend.

1287
01:19:54,357 --> 01:19:56,924
Smurfette is a bunny wrangler.

1288
01:19:56,926 --> 01:19:58,392
She's tough.

1289
01:19:58,394 --> 01:20:01,395
Not as tough as me,
but tough enough.

1290
01:20:02,565 --> 01:20:07,535
Smurfette can be anything
she wants to be.

1291
01:20:54,150 --> 01:20:56,717
What's going on in there?
Goodbye!

1292
01:21:35,091 --> 01:21:36,957
Say, "blue cheese!"

1293
01:21:36,959 --> 01:21:38,659
Blue cheese!

1294
01:25:08,871 --> 01:25:12,473
I was this close
to getting rid of the smurfs,

1295
01:25:12,475 --> 01:25:14,141
and you ruined everything.

1296
01:25:14,143 --> 01:25:16,777
I knew I should have gotten
a dog from the shelter.

1297
01:25:18,481 --> 01:25:20,547
I'm not saying this
to be cruel, okay?

1298
01:25:20,549 --> 01:25:23,317
I'm saying it to
be constructive.

1299
01:25:23,319 --> 01:25:25,752
You're a useless feline.

1300
01:25:27,556 --> 01:25:29,423
That's just mean. That's mean.

1301
01:25:29,425 --> 01:25:32,092
There was a line,
and you crossed it.

1302
01:25:32,094 --> 01:25:33,560
I was just jib-jabbing,

1303
01:25:33,562 --> 01:25:35,996
and you crossed that line,
and that stung.

1304
01:25:35,998 --> 01:25:37,297
I demand an apology.

1305
01:25:38,767 --> 01:25:41,235
You were going to learn this
one way or another,

1306
01:25:41,237 --> 01:25:44,304
but I am not your real father.

1307
01:25:45,407 --> 01:25:46,707
But that doesn't matter now.

1308
01:25:46,709 --> 01:25:49,409
What matters is
destroying the smurfs.

1309
01:25:49,411 --> 01:25:51,612
Any thoughts?
I mean, I have thoughts.

1310
01:25:51,614 --> 01:25:53,847
But I always like to spitball
off of your thoughts.

1311
01:25:55,184 --> 01:25:57,451
Azrael, I'm not
going to sugarcoat this.

1312
01:25:57,453 --> 01:25:59,286
Your ideas are terrible.

1313
01:26:01,857 --> 01:26:03,857
I can't think with this music.

1314
01:26:03,859 --> 01:26:06,960
Can someone please
shut off the music?

1315
01:26:06,962 --> 01:26:08,862
And what's with all these words

1316
01:26:08,864 --> 01:26:11,031
scrolling in front of me?

1317
01:26:11,033 --> 01:26:14,334
Did the smurfs do this
so that I would be distracted

1318
01:26:14,336 --> 01:26:17,137
and not be able to
destroy them as easily?

1319
01:26:18,807 --> 01:26:21,341
"Matte painters"? I don't
even know what that means.

1320
01:26:21,343 --> 01:26:22,809
Someone just
made that up, right?

1321
01:26:22,811 --> 01:26:25,546
I feel sorry for
whoever "matte" is.

1322
01:26:25,548 --> 01:26:28,448
"Look development artists"?

1323
01:26:28,450 --> 01:26:30,784
Oh, yes, of course,
let's develop some looks.

1324
01:26:30,786 --> 01:26:32,352
Like maybe a really angry look,

1325
01:26:32,354 --> 01:26:36,056
because you two
totally ruined my plans.

1326
01:26:37,193 --> 01:26:38,959
Am I going mad, Azrael?

1327
01:26:38,961 --> 01:26:40,160
For the last time,

1328
01:26:40,162 --> 01:26:42,563
get them to shut off this music!
