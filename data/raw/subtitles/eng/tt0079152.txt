1
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,287
Colbert !

2
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,726
What a joy to see you!

3
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,810
You too, d'Artagnan.

4
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,206
Time is short.

5
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,169
My castle is nearby.

6
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,281
Your message did not arrive yesterday.

7
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,091
Can not you receive
with great pomp.

8
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,402
My visit do it remain secret.

9
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,206
D'Artagnan?

10
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,886
Who accompanies it?

11
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,644
I do not recognize.

12
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,288
Regardless, there is only one.

13
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,124
It is large enough.

14
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,287
Tenezvous
ready with the coach.

15
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,125
I could not miss this opportunity,

16
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,805
despite the risk.

17
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:54,249
You will find your people before
the sun is at its zenith.

18
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,169
Dismoi, D'Artagnan,
how is the boy?

19
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,321
The boy!

20
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:07,848
Go!

21
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:15,689
Encore!

22
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,206
Good job!

23
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,406
Eyes in the back!

24
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,530
I've told
have eyes in the back!

25
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,923
You learn, but you fight
still loyal to.

26
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,722
It was Philip
a true gentleman of France.

27
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,367
Handling the sword
before breakfast,

28
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,721
then Athos

29
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,764
taught him Greek and Latin.

30
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,001
Colbert!

31
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,525
What an unexpected pleasure!

32
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,487
I am delighted, Athos.

33
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,324
Welcome.
Thanks.

34
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,810
It's very expensive, this is a feint
clever.

35
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,844
If you want to use
card game

36
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,085
Be sure to remember it
in "discussions" that will follow.

37
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,604
Do you want to learn it?

38
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,282
Montremoi.

39
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,442
Here is our godson, Philip.

40
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,568
Mr. Colbert, an old friend.

41
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,131
Aramis, Porthos...

42
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,802
Very honored.

43
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,925
Go tell our lovely Marianne
that we starve.

44
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,362
Embrassela And on my part.

45
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,602
Marianne takes care of the castle.

46
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,288
She was the nurse of Philip on his arrival here.

47
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,406
How trouvezvous?

48
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,320
Extraordinary.

49
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,642
Absolutely amazing.

50
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,007
Ten men.
With me to the stables.

51
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,288
Follow the captain.

52
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,721
Can I help you?

53
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,848
For once you're there!

54
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,525
On behalf of D'Artagnan.

55
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,011
He returned with a friend.

56
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,162
I know, everything is ready.

57
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,924
Dismoi, Marianne,

58
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,968
Colbert is this?

59
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:55,169
Negotiations with Spain led
?

60
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,651
Absolutely.

61
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,962
I'm agree with me.

62
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,523
It only remains to persuade King

63
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,126
a marriage for the salvation of France

64
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:08,888
do it pass before his preferences
somewhat eccentric.

65
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,690
Good luck!

66
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,722
Baron?

67
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,925
The breakfast, at last!

68
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,005
How does  "last"?
It was indeed ready.

69
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,241
Hello,

70
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,522
M. Colbert.

71
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:50,882
I believe in the virtue of persuasive
dowry of the Infanta.

72
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,804
Spanish doubloons 600000

73
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,760
will do a better lawyer than I
with Louis.

74
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,570
Its coffers are empty.

75
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,246
Louis accept this marriage,

76
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,970
even reluctantly.

77
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:07,120
And I will put an end to these futile wars
with Spain.

78
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,485
Troubles arrive.

79
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,766
We do not see you do it.

80
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,160
Retenezles!

81
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,449
Gentlemen, you disappoint me.

82
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:30,650
I hoped
cross swords with you before your surrender.

83
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,926
Emmenezles!

84
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,527
The swords!

85
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,845
Out of my wine!

86
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,847
Horses!

87
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,881
The stairs!

88
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,926
The river is there.

89
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,889
Your people are on the other side.

90
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,724
You will be safe.

91
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,807
Sergeant !

92
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,011
Drop your swords.

93
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,169
Qu'attendiezvous?

94
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,125
Drop your swords.

95
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,647
Do not obey! Not for me!

96
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,449
The others too.

97
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,170
Emmenezle to the coach.

98
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,486
I wonder how this will
, Labas.

99
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,047
Your Highness looking forward to it?

100
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,041
Not for the country, for the man.

101
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:33,481
Hard to get an idea
with a picture as old.

102
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,330
Savezvous what I think?

103
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,051
What you have any hidden
recent portrait.

104
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,126
Your Highness,
why would I do?

105
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:47,241
To hide what he became.

106
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:52,284
I can assure you that
Louis of France is a handsome man

107
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,487
and very dignified.

108
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,805
This is a cynical and dissolute

109
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,803
with many mistresses.

110
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,611
It is also said

111
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,001
he is hated by all the French.

112
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,364
Who  tenezvous these lies?

113
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,531
I have to marry the king
unknown to me.

114
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,451
But if I can not love, know

115
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,570
that policy or not,
the marriage will happen.

116
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,482
Ecartezvous! Make way!

117
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,884
Lower the grill!

118
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,207
Is it ready?

119
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,326
Amenezle.

120
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,247
Gardezles!

121
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,840
Here!
Too late!

122
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,449
Twenty years too late...

123
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,442
Be found.

124
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,727
Commander?

125
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,326
Here, Captain.

126
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,643
The man in the coach do it
wear this.

127
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,645
No one do it to see it.

128
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,045
Courage, my boy.

129
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,406
Amenezle inside.

130
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,690
Where emmenezvous me?

131
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,965
Remove the escort.

132
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,725
Online.

133
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,800
Hurry.

134
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,161
Quick!

135
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,323
You will soon return.

136
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,125
LÃ¢chezmoi!

137
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,765
Attachezle.

138
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,527
What have I done?
Diteslemoi.

139
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,923
Emmenezles  and wait outside.

140
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,366
Do you want your freedom, right?

141
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,851
What Voulezvous me?

142
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,050
Who ordered that?

143
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,480
These figures,
corrected by me,

144
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,369
are to show the king.

145
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,603
The original do-it being turned.

146
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,242
It's done.

147
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,644
And those who saw it?

148
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,521
All dead.

149
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,445
Dear Captain,

150
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,322
there is only one person,

151
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,881
except  MySelf, who knows

152
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,247
face that hides the iron mask...

153
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,129
You.

154
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:04,728
Milord?

155
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:10,400
I know I can count on your silence
, Captain.

156
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,769
Rassurezvous, you have no fear of having
.

157
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,683
Come back before dusk.

158
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:20,448
I will have the title
your domain.

159
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,003
You are now owner.

160
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,130
This is it, the La Valliere!

161
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,770
The king's whore!

162
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,691
You and your beautiful coach!

163
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,047
It helps to be the king's mistress!

164
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,440
Take the fucking!

165
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,682
Here is your king, whore!

166
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,366
Regains your lair,

167
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,171
dirty whore!

168
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,647
That's how you end up!

169
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:06,648
Madam, I would appreciate
prevent his Majesty that I expect

170
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,962
to maintain
of a material fact.

171
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,691
So, Mr. Colbert,

172
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:18,243
ditesmoi
what is going on and I will inform His Majesty.

173
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,120
You are too good.

174
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:23,124
But it is vital that I speak to Her Majesty

175
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,122
himself.

176
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:28,403
I do not doubt it.
I let him know.

177
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,521
Her Majesty will be pleased to know
you expect.

178
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:47,123
How is
His Majesty today?

179
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,526
Do I need to fetch the doctor?

180
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:02,130
The Crown-
need of such bleeding?

181
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:07,689
Her Majesty  right.
What good blood,

182
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,650
if not that of others?

183
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,285
I forgot...

184
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,842
Expected Colbert to talk

185
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,449
Spanish reached this
you going to marry.

186
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,321
I know you must do.

187
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,122
But no question that you have.

188
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,688
She can love you like me.

189
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,484
This is impossible.

190
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,241
I am the only woman

191
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,529
you truly love.

192
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,565
It works!

193
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:46,649
What?

194
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,242
Give a number and I do.

195
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,127
Fascinating...

196
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,727
Of the six, four, no matter!

197
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,085
Try six.

198
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,531
Go, my pretty,

199
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,041
be good.

200
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:08,767
There is a trick!

201
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,360
Point of thing.

202
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:13,569
Question fingering
and training.

203
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,286
Montremoi those dice.

204
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:21,251
I think our friends Labas

205
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,640
take the bait.

206
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,889
Want to see ?

207
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,321
Do you?

208
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,886
Approchezvous grid,
that everyone sees.

209
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,123
It takes the dice like that.

210
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,327
Interesting.

211
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:40,802
It is desired numbers
under these two fingers.

212
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,088
How about it?

213
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,449
Oublieles and montrenous.

214
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:49,002
We always need money!

215
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,961
The secret

216
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,283
is in the launch.

217
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,761
As this... September

218
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,571
I want to try.
No, me!

219
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,650
No, me first!

220
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:02,642
Willingly.

221
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,286
Perfect.

222
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,200
Beautiful demonstration.

223
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,965
Go back to your cell

224
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:34,689
and comportezvous
in sentient beings,

225
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:37,889
grandparents in adults.

226
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,407
Move!

227
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:51,249
Another, Your Majesty.

228
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:04,960
Now you can steal with impunity
, thanks to the royal seal.

229
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:08,642
Do not bafouillez, Fouquet,
I'm not an idiot.

230
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,122
You're not more.

231
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,646
Furthermore,
the state of my finances

232
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,325
forbids me to pay you.

233
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,884
I can assure you...

234
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,725
Stop playing the innocent.

235
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,688
After all, it is the Treasury
you fly,

236
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,603
I do not.

237
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,644
Avisezvous
to touch my money to Spanish

238
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,562
and your head will top a picnic!

239
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,961
My love!

240
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,969
Have a drink.

241
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,283
You certainly need

242
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,011
and what a wonderful remedy
you...

243
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,051
Take care,

244
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,168
I can undo it.

245
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,244
I would again appeal to your
remedies.

246
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,088
Colbert has arranged everything for tomorrow?

247
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,403
Any, Your Majesty.

248
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,161
I have all the details.

249
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:25,161
It will kill me tomorrow, my love
.

250
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:28,005
In view of all Paris.

251
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,166
Whatever, I'm not even there.

252
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,881
You said...

253
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,241
I'll explain.

254
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:35,887
You know,

255
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:39,567
attempts were made to raise the population
against me.

256
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:43,447
I'll show them what is the terrible power

257
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:47,207
one of which was invested by
heaven itself!

258
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,961
The idea comes from him.
Diteslui.

259
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,044
I learned that a young Gascon

260
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:59,522
looked so amazing to the king.

261
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:02,490
It will take the place of His Majesty

262
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,291
for the arrival of the Infanta.

263
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,010
The idea do it please you.

264
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:10,801
And then, it will
killed by enemies of the crown.

265
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,689
Carefully selected...

266
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,842
Accepteraitil Why?

267
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,365
To wellbeing.

268
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:19,364
And the salvation of his dearest friends.

269
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,603
An hour later, I
rÃ©apparaÃ®trai,

270
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,921
free!

271
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:27,402
The king is dead! Long live the king!

272
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,642
Proof  divinity of the king.

273
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:33,361
No more hand
will dare to come to challenge you.

274
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:37,526
You will become a living legend.

275
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,842
These dogs do not like me,

276
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,130
but after this,

277
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,847
they fear me.

278
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,045
Go, young man.

279
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,846
Standing.

280
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:11,004
Your test is completed.
More than a few minutes.

281
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,487
Go now.

282
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:08,049
I'll see you at Fontainebleau
in an hour.

283
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,402
Do not see, my darling.

284
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:11,841
HÃ¢tezvous.

285
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,641
Ditesmoi,

286
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:40,363
estce the custom in your country
lost

287
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:43,603
to sit in the presence of his king?

288
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,286
He does not believe me.
Diteslui, Fouquet.

289
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:53,170
You are in the presence of Her Majesty
Louis

290
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,648
king of France and Navarre.

291
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,931
Standing peasant.

292
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,288
You've been talking about me.

293
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:10,563
You come from far
tone but you talk about me?

294
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,960
Certainly.

295
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,805
Who does not know
Louis, King of France?

296
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,328
That's much better.

297
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:23,167
The coat, he tries.

298
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:28,642
We will be able to satisfy your curiosity.

299
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,208
"We"?

300
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,528
Fouquet, for once
I use the royal "we"

301
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,723
without feeling ridiculous.

302
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,930
We, my good friend...

303
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:48,643
We will do a two,

304
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,325
for a day.

305
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,642
This should be enough.

306
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,685
Continue, Fouquet,

307
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:57,491
it's up to you to explain, not mine
.

308
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,241
You are here

309
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:06,281
to complete a secret task.

310
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:09,683
Tomorrow, you will replace the king.

311
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:14,881
If you obey the letter, you will be rewarded

312
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,407
And the Musketeers will be released.

313
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,211
Otherwise...

314
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,365
Check , forward.

315
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,524
Go, scum!

316
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,322
Let us hear you! Stronger!

317
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,410
You can get away!

318
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,771
We are alone.

319
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,042
Damned bells!

320
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,806
Their sound has always driven him mad.

321
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,490
Louis, my love,

322
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,961
saurezvous
how it's over?

323
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,010
Keeping at least

324
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,640
a look at Paris.

325
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,810
The voyezvous?

326
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,726
Your Majesty!

327
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,564
Your hand, idiot.

328
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,161
Go ahead.

329
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:56,363
Your Majesty, let
few words of welcome?

330
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,321
Your Majesty looks surprised.

331
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:05,089
I did not expect
to see you here, Mr. Colbert.

332
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,127
Philip!

333
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,447
Did not you know?

334
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,125
I swear.

335
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,087
The Musketeers?

336
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,605
EmbastillÃ©s.

337
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:22,289
I did not know all that.
You are perhaps in danger.

338
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,202
Caution.

339
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:27,924
Everything
at the convenience of Her Majesty?

340
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,161
Everything is perfect.

341
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,362
It looks better than expected.

342
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,726
Company!

343
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,487
What happened?

344
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,721
You have nothing?

345
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,569
Do you have seen the king?

346
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,001
Here is the king!

347
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,641
The King!

348
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,410
The King is safe!

349
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:46,163
Stand back!

350
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:19,967
Louis, look!

351
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,447
It's done!

352
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,326
The king is safe.

353
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,205
His coach!

354
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,164
The Musketeers!
Use your power.

355
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,525
My faithful friends!

356
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,526
My faithful friends!

357
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,003
Thank God

358
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:17,083
and yourself

359
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,368
For the reception of the queen.

360
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,884
To mark this day

361
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,330
we order

362
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,325
by Royal Decree

363
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:42,362
that the gates of the Bastille
are open!

364
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,967
And as it houses

365
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:51,605
and who are incarcerated,
benefit of a grace

366
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,367
And  again become free men!

367
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,682
God bless you all!

368
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:21,208
You are more accustomed
me in this.

369
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,326
I am

370
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,448
apologize for what happened.

371
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:42,406
I am so happy that Her Majesty be saved!

372
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:47,321
Who were these men?

373
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:49,722
These men?

374
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,646
God only knows.

375
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:00,481
I must admit that your majesty surprises me.

376
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:03,369
I had your portrait

377
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,887
but it does not show everything.

378
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:06,927
Certainly not.

379
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:11,244
I have also said things...

380
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,606
What are they?

381
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:15,525
Who does not match what I see.

382
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,883
You are very diplomatic.

383
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:19,962
It makes you angry?

384
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,968
Please to believe...

385
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:27,691
It is not a question of pleasing me.

386
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:30,764
My only hope is that your life here

387
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,445
you like.

388
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,082
It pleases me, I'm sure.

389
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,448
Check , faster!

390
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,762
To celebrate my immortality:

391
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:56,447
fireworks
and solemn procession!

392
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:58,651
What it's fun!

393
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:05,408
Why this decision?

394
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,640
It's Fouquet.

395
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:16,767
Your Majesty.

396
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,082
Check, turn around.

397
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:20,169
Qu'estce to say, Fouquet?

398
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,005
It is alive.

399
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,401
It is alive.

400
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:25,847
You almost! idiot!

401
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,684
How did you have?

402
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,041
D'Artagnan!

403
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:09,041
Quick, the deception can not last.
It is the palace.

404
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:13,805
Porthos behind.

405
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:17,246
Must convince him to leave.

406
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:53,962
Glorious, no?

407
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:56,600
Yes, but do not forget your friends

408
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:58,842
they're waiting in a carriage.

409
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:14,082
D'Artagnan?

410
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,481
Together again, Fouquet.

411
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:18,483
It was a long time.

412
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:20,161
Been Aramis

413
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:24,560
Athos and .

414
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:27,481
Porthos, of course.

415
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,281
You have a priceless object.

416
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,083
It'll please you, Porthos.

417
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:50,369
Gentlemen,
you are free to go.

418
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:52,247
You all.

419
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,926
Take the impostor
and you will live.

420
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,089
We will do it ourselves.

421
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:30,762
He comes.

422
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:32,490
Let's go! Hurry!

423
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:40,842
Pardonnezmoi
but Her Majesty looks worried.

424
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:42,685
What Estil?

425
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,522
I have to leave. I'm sorry.

426
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:48,761
Please.

427
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:49,808
I have to.

428
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:53,891
Promettezmoi back to me quickly.

429
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:56,841
I promise.

430
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:08,730
I will return.

431
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:49,927
Fouquet?

432
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,005
Etesvous there, Fouquet?

433
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:11,566
My dear Fouquet

434
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:12,767
you are looking for.

435
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:17,202
I thought you were talking with the king.

436
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:21,406
Yes, of course.

437
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:26,887
Where Estil?

438
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:28,208
The King?

439
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:30,647
No one knows where to find it.

440
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:34,649
I mean
D'Artagnan and his friends.

441
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:37,965
The Musketeers ?
They were here?

442
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:44,686
Do not play at the end
with me, Colbert.

443
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:48,362
They will pay with their lives.

444
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:53,847
I apologize.

445
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:59,003
I must find my king.

446
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:25,966
Wait outside, please.

447
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:37,361
Sister Anne,

448
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:40,366
you are summoned to Paris.

449
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:44,367
You are cleared until you return

450
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:47,530
your vow of silence.

451
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:52,001
God be with you.

452
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:51,360
Bernard

453
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:53,245
What joy to see you!

454
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:54,811
Do you have slept well?

455
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,689
We slept.

456
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:59,969
There is not much better than staying here
the Bastille.

457
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:06,042
Porthos, you may
to be drunk by noon

458
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:08,248
and owe me a fortune tonight.

459
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,448
How do you know it was me?

460
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:12,965
You stay long?

461
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:15,726
The time that things
pack down a bit.

462
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:17,450
You are involved all ,

463
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:20,327
or your young friend only?

464
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:24,527
Estce Who?

465
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:29,370
Do not you know your king
when you did before you?

466
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:31,480
Included.

467
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:33,847
"Mind your own business,
Bernard."

468
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:36,162
Only one man knows where we are.

469
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:39,244
He will present himself as Mr. William
.

470
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:40,606
You'll do it down.

471
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:42,762
If someone else had?

472
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:44,445
Jettele down!

473
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:08,605
Will this make me wait long
?

474
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:13,243
HRH
wants to show you its best.

475
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:16,882
To Me? Or that boor
who she was before?

476
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:22,046
Victoria

477
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:23,520
tell Mr. Colbert

478
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:27,082
I see Her Majesty
soon as I get dressed.

479
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:33,569
If your head is always on your shoulders,

480
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:35,961
it is because only you can find it.

481
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:38,009
But your time is limited!

482
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:40,606
My men everywhere want.

483
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:50,251
Your Majesty...

484
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,326
His Royal Highness the Infanta of Spain.

485
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:58,327
Madam,

486
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:00,085
thank you for coming.

487
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:05,646
Your Majesty.

488
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:07,290
Please be seated.

489
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:17,209
Your Majesty has recovered
of yesterday's events?

490
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:19,529
Thank you.
We handed.

491
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:31,326
We'll discuss this later.
I have sent for you,

492
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:34,643
indeed to see you again, but for
this document

493
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:36,247
mere formality

494
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:38,767
requiring your signature.

495
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,562
Fouquet, have the kindness...

496
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:59,406
I can assure you
that everything is in order.

497
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:10,324
Pardonnezmoi,
but I do not understand your language.

498
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,009
I beg your pardon.

499
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:17,529
I asked if he agreed to sign
before marriage

500
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:20,047
And not after,
as is customary.

501
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:22,329
Before, after...

502
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:25,127
How important,
for two days!

503
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:26,486
You will not refuse!

504
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:31,123
I see no reason to hurry
unnecessarily.

505
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:32,567
Vain!

506
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:38,170
Is is perhaps not that there
a protocol problem.

507
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:39,641
Is it not, Fouquet?

508
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:45,610
Perhaps, Your Majesty...

509
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:48,127
"Perhaps"
It looks like two parrots!

510
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:50,804
It shall be as you please.

511
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:52,771
We will write

512
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:54,001
a new agreement,

513
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:55,764
after the ceremony.

514
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:58,005
Thank you, ma'am, for coming.

515
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:10,845
Your Majesty, it would be better...

516
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,004
That's going to take care of
this witch!

517
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:19,363
We can not afford
a diplomatic incident.

518
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:50,488
What did the other moron yesterday?

519
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:52,888
You think he could confide?

520
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:56,841
It is never sure of anything.

521
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:02,681
It is never sure of anything.

522
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:05,406
Estil Who?

523
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:10,161
My love.

524
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:13,484
Thank you God, you are there!

525
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:17,723
Unable All these will make me mad.

526
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:19,803
Everything had to be so simple.

527
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:21,644
It should be dead.

528
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:23,723
My poor Louis.

529
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:25,846
RÃ©pondezmoi!

530
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:31,727
Your Majesty,
I took the liberty to call

531
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:35,327
someone who can answer you better than me.

532
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:37,810
If your Majesty would follow me...

533
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:40,246
Okay, Fouquet.

534
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:44,448
Come listen to your informant.

535
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:46,602
Pray that he told the truth.

536
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:52,642
Aramis...

537
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:54,002
Who am I?

538
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:17,489
You?

539
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:20,561
Your Majesty.

540
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:22,523
Mother!

541
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:27,605
It is my brother?

542
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,525
This is the truth, Philip.

543
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:33,523
We were there when D'Artagnan brought you.

544
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:36,490
Your father
immediately saw the danger.

545
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:40,605
Twins... Twins
heirs to the throne of France.

546
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:41,568
Inconceivable.

547
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:44,849
We have fomented civil wars
for less than that.

548
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,240
Why me?

549
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:49,327
Why this is I
that my father chose?

550
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:51,403
He had no choice.

551
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:55,801
It took one of two babies,
closest to him

552
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,729
and he told us.

553
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:01,084
Nobody knows where

554
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:02,810
was born first?

555
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:06,122
Person.

556
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:10,166
That is impossible!

557
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:14,564
Colbert and the Musketeers had the confidence of your father.

558
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:17,521
I am not aware
for two years.

559
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,570
And he is still alive?

560
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,650
It is your brother!

561
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:28,642
Do him no harm.

562
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:34,170
Savezvous  invisible bonds that connect
twins?

563
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:38,245
By attacking him
you would put in grave danger.

564
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:43,766
I will not ask you
your word,

565
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:47,324
because you do not feel
required to comply.

566
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:50,761
Souvenezvous of my warning.

567
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:54,882
These are the last words
you hear me.

568
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:05,968
"No choice", D'Artagnan.

569
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:08,885
Your own words.
And my brother was crowned.

570
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:14,810
For all we know, I could
well be the first born.

571
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:20,565
You want him to take his crown?

572
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:24,081
Would I do a worse king
him?

573
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:27,685
Much better.

574
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:30,411
You had a much better king.

575
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:32,642
Be careful what you say.

576
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:34,211
From treason.

577
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:36,806
Exact. It's ugly to betray.

578
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:38,451
It's not for us.

579
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:39,931
Too risky.

580
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:43,011
Beware  great disappointments,
my liege.

581
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:47,888
They are right, my boy.

582
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:49,805
Forget it.

583
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:54,010
Think of the campaign,
open spaces, trees...

584
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,889
And Marietherese?

585
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:02,848
What will til her?

586
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:33,202
I have one!

587
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:36,489
Wonderful, my dear I need you
ll match.

588
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:51,684
True
that Her Majesty may be

589
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:52,966
moody.

590
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:55,369
It is sometimes a good mood.

591
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:59,003
Your Highness has ellemÃªme
experienced.

592
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:04,491
Mr. Colbert,
I discovered that you were good.

593
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:09,369
While for you it is a marriage
political arrangement.

594
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:11,966
Croyezmoi, I caress the hope

595
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:14,009
it more than that.

596
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:16,927
Thank you, Colbert.
I hope so too.

597
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:20,486
Hunters!

598
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:24,045
These are the king's horses.

599
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:27,165
Yes, I think.

600
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:30,321
Let's surprise him.

601
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:33,645
We may disturb the hunt.

602
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:38,722
Pensezvous! The king has fun,
it may be in a good mood.

603
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:41,164
I would like that, Colbert.

604
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:44,522
Here it is.

605
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:56,605
I take it, madam.

606
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:01,807
My dear,

607
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:04,163
great you are.

608
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:07,122
Not satisfied with being the best,

609
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:10,363
you hunt better than any man.

610
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:19,487
My God, that I hunt fautil
far?

611
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:36,411
You abuse your privileges to our yard.

612
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:39,803
Privileges, Your Majesty?

613
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:43,201
The Infanta did not need

614
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:45,408
to move as it wishes.

615
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:48,849
We are sorry

616
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:51,851
to have disturbed your hunt!

617
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:05,807
Do not move.

618
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:08,004
And it will not attack you.

619
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:21,200
Expliquezlui, it ignores
he's dealing with His Highness.

620
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:38,563
Reconduisezla
away from his apartment.

621
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:40,166
See you later, ma'am.

622
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:45,531
As for you, Colbert

623
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:48,923
you did was of no help
this afternoon.

624
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:53,166
The hunt continues.

625
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:57,322
Never

626
01:03:57,480 --> 01:04:01,280
for anything,
I marry this man.

627
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:36,807
Go and never come back here.

628
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:41,647
Abroad,
what business brings you here?

629
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:42,881
Bernard?

630
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:44,371
Who asks?

631
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:47,207
I am Mr. William.

632
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:49,442
You come to your friends.

633
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:51,682
Hurry, they go soon.

634
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:18,885
Colbert, come with us.

635
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:20,690
We save.

636
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:28,608
Where is Philip?

637
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:29,888
Here!

638
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:32,882
We have the art of disguise.

639
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:36,690
Do not forget that
Porthos has emptied the barrel.

640
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:39,284
Others also fled.

641
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:42,330
The Infanta left Paris.
I have done anything.

642
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:44,086
Qu'estil happened?

643
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:46,921
The inevitable...  Louis arrived,

644
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:49,726
this whore
La Valliere arrived.

645
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:54,170
If Marietherese arrives in Spain, it means war

646
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:56,768
and the end of all my work.

647
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:11,802
Here, for you my friend.

648
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:12,722
Thank you.

649
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:14,405
Very kind of you.

650
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:17,001
Wine, guys! Good wine!

651
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:19,882
Buvonsle the square.

652
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:21,690
No, take this street.

653
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:33,211
Not to worry.

654
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:35,681
These morons do not know what they are looking
.

655
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:38,931
The Princess
do not do it out of France.

656
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:40,401
What to do?

657
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:43,721
When the king learns his departure...

658
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:44,927
Ll send the troops.

659
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:47,681
We must find her before.

660
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:48,443
How?

661
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:50,525
We will get there.

662
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:52,207
But how?

663
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:54,642
I know where to find it.

664
01:06:55,640 --> 01:06:57,130
We need horses!

665
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:05,041
We are proud of them.
"Chantel", a great hunter. And. ..

666
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:07,606
My fiery steed.

667
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:10,284
Regardezle closer.

668
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:20,840
You are nervous.
Rightly.

669
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:24,846
I am the ambassador of the King of Spain,

670
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:26,765
protected by the crown...

671
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:28,251
For nothing.

672
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:29,482
Where Estelle?

673
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:31,083
Where Estelle?

674
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:32,287
I beg you!

675
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:36,800
I know!

676
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:40,168
There is one hour.

677
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:41,162
The southern route.

678
01:08:04,040 --> 01:08:04,962
Labas!

679
01:08:21,720 --> 01:08:22,369
HaltelÃ !

680
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:24,922
Ãtesvous Who? This is an outrage!

681
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:27,922
Do not worry, Your Highness.

682
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:30,641
Ecoutezmoi.

683
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:32,765
How osezvous?

684
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:34,405
You are in danger! Come!

685
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:38,280
Soldiers!

686
01:08:39,320 --> 01:08:40,731
Turn off the lantern!

687
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:44,327
Convainquezla.

688
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:45,806
We will retain.

689
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:47,722
Turn off that.

690
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:48,529
Ecoutezmoi!

691
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:49,960
Time is running out!

692
01:08:50,320 --> 01:08:51,651
I must take you!

693
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:53,165
No.
It must!

694
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:56,245
We'll talk later.

695
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:57,606
Let them go.

696
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:50,645
Consider the woods!

697
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:52,484
They dismount!

698
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:23,726
It is not there!

699
01:10:56,920 --> 01:10:58,490
We are pursuing?

700
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:02,808
We have retained enough.

701
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:03,927
What is being done?

702
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:05,088
The ladies...

703
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:07,649
We can not abandon them.

704
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,843
The ladies!
Course, Aramis.

705
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:14,482
I was raised in Gascony
by D'Artagnan.

706
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:17,610
I always thought
that my father had died at Sens.

707
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:21,606
I did in Paris was my double,

708
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:22,886
the King of France.

709
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:25,450
I swear,

710
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:28,485
Louis and I are twins.

711
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:39,761
I have learned that this morning.

712
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:52,245
Qu'allonsnous do?

713
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:54,566
Something...

714
01:11:55,640 --> 01:11:56,880
Magic.

715
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:18,209
Watch your step.

716
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:21,166
Okay?

717
01:12:41,680 --> 01:12:43,728
Where ironsnous tomorrow?

718
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,126
Your eyes are green.

719
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:07,165
We know so little
from each other.

720
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:10,763
D'Artagnan must be prevented.

721
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:12,331
What?

722
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:16,041
What is the brother of King
you want to marry.

723
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:41,170
Bernard, listen!

724
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:42,646
Who is it?

725
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:54,646
Be careful.

726
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:03,242
Who goes there?

727
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:06,090
Calm, Bernard.

728
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:09,122
No one knows we're here.

729
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:11,001
I thought...

730
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:13,440
Do not be silly.

731
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:17,606
Come.

732
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:55,721
Do not go away.

733
01:14:56,680 --> 01:14:57,761
It's late.

734
01:14:58,320 --> 01:14:59,651
We must leave.

735
01:15:00,440 --> 01:15:01,566
Rest.

736
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:03,400
Stay here.

737
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:05,683
Nobody knows we're here.

738
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:12,601
I beg you.

739
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:15,845
Quick, go!

740
01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:03,846
This time,

741
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:06,289
you do not escape.

742
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:43,724
Why keep him alive?

743
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:46,729
It is my brother.

744
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:50,160
Then,

745
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:52,244
he will die soon

746
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:54,085
by choking

747
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:57,801
with her own hair.

748
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:01,648
I do not have to be there for nothing.

749
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:03,370
Nothing.

750
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:06,848
I wish I knew already dead.

751
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:24,004
Surprised, Colbert?

752
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:29,010
You have stopped it?

753
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:31,408
Stopped?
Not quite,

754
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:35,770
but it will be hard to
again elude us.

755
01:18:36,040 --> 01:18:40,648
N'Ãªtesvous not relieved?
I saved your own diplomacy.

756
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:45,245
As the dot  Spanish
course.

757
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:49,329
Of course, double benefit...

758
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:52,043
What more?

759
01:18:55,240 --> 01:18:57,242
Pardonnezmoi, I have to do.

760
01:19:11,320 --> 01:19:12,810
You will stay here.

761
01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:25,886
Your Highness,

762
01:19:26,040 --> 01:19:27,963
can I help you?

763
01:19:28,160 --> 01:19:30,606
Ecartezvous of my way.

764
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:33,331
Can we ask you # where you go?

765
01:19:33,480 --> 01:19:34,811
We can.

766
01:19:40,360 --> 01:19:42,567
The king does not want to see you.

767
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:49,849
You take in very comfortably

768
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,162
for someone so ordinary.

769
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:56,843
The king grants me the privilege.

770
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,684
Do not forget,

771
01:19:59,160 --> 01:20:00,650
Your Highness .

772
01:20:01,480 --> 01:20:04,689
I want to see the Spanish ambassador.

773
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:07,727
It is unfortunately impossible.

774
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:09,564
How you permettezvous...

775
01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:12,724
HE
succumbed to an accident.

776
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:14,644
A fall from a horse.

777
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:16,570
Tragic.

778
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:19,803
Hard to believe it.

779
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:22,122
The ambassador did not come up.

780
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:24,282
The horses terrified him.

781
01:20:24,440 --> 01:20:26,966
This explains it.

782
01:20:27,680 --> 01:20:30,331
Yes, he was murdered.

783
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:31,607
Guards!

784
01:20:33,960 --> 01:20:36,486
Escort to His Highness
apartments.

785
01:20:36,640 --> 01:20:37,880
She is suffering.

786
01:20:38,280 --> 01:20:41,409
If necessary, please
to let me know.

787
01:20:41,560 --> 01:20:42,527
Exit.

788
01:20:42,680 --> 01:20:43,920
ObÃ©issezmoi.

789
01:20:44,080 --> 01:20:45,241
Get out!

790
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:53,761
You were clumsy,
Your Highness.

791
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:55,888
You are no longer in Spain.

792
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:04,725
While you have a very high opinion of
vousmÃªme,

793
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:07,766
Do not forget

794
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:10,890
Tomorrow I'll be the queen of France,

795
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:12,041
not you.

796
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:15,450
Do you believe that this will change anything?

797
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:21,569
You are very young, very pretty,

798
01:21:21,720 --> 01:21:23,210
but very naive.

799
01:21:25,240 --> 01:21:28,562
And you, madam,
with all these years and more,

800
01:21:28,720 --> 01:21:33,169
're crazy enough to believe that
I will have no influence.

801
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:38,367
Your influence is checked by seeing if your
boorish lover

802
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:41,000
wither to death in the Bastille

803
01:21:41,160 --> 01:21:43,845
or, tortured, begging that he
the ends.

804
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,685
This thought seems to give you some amazement.

805
01:21:49,480 --> 01:21:51,005
Why?

806
01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:53,649
Strange passion...

807
01:21:54,640 --> 01:21:55,721
Pardonnezmoi.

808
01:21:56,920 --> 01:21:58,604
I will do my best

809
01:21:58,760 --> 01:22:02,606
passion for such a dead letter.

810
01:22:22,600 --> 01:22:24,409
What a joy to know you saved.

811
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:27,325
I'd rather be at large.

812
01:22:27,880 --> 01:22:32,363
ordered to accompany His Highness
to his apartments.

813
01:22:32,680 --> 01:22:35,047
In this case, we must obey.

814
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:38,045
Allow me to accompany you.

815
01:22:39,480 --> 01:22:43,565
I must confess that one of charms
your company

816
01:22:43,720 --> 01:22:48,248
lies in being able
practice your native language.

817
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:52,163
Souvenezvous,
at the court of your father,

818
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:55,403
I had some skill in this area.

819
01:23:44,040 --> 01:23:45,929
Have you seen anyone go?

820
01:23:46,080 --> 01:23:47,241
I am blind.

821
01:23:56,680 --> 01:24:01,083
We can not let this happen
and consider themselves the Musketeers.

822
01:24:04,280 --> 01:24:06,123
Well, what?

823
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:11,287
Marietherese
suggested me an idea, but...

824
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:12,441
Frankly...

825
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:14,648
Always tell.

826
01:24:16,280 --> 01:24:19,523
It draws
the last sentence of Philip

827
01:24:20,680 --> 01:24:24,082
and depends on the ability of
Marietherese to do

828
01:24:24,240 --> 01:24:25,924
able to do what she says.

829
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:28,006
I hesitate .

830
01:24:29,280 --> 01:24:32,648
Do not forget
it is a remarkable woman.

831
01:25:01,640 --> 01:25:04,769
Everything will be ready for the return of His Majesty
tomorrow.

832
01:25:04,920 --> 01:25:06,285
So be it.

833
01:25:06,440 --> 01:25:07,771
I'm getting married, of course,

834
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:11,242
but no way to miss
one day hunting for it.

835
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:17,681
Estce Who?

836
01:25:21,480 --> 01:25:22,208
My love?

837
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:25,884
Where Ãªtesvous?
I thought you were at Fontainebleau.

838
01:25:26,040 --> 01:25:27,121
I was...

839
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:31,561
Ãtesvous How come?

840
01:25:32,040 --> 01:25:33,326
I walked.

841
01:25:34,840 --> 01:25:35,727
Etesvous only?

842
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:37,211
My guards?

843
01:25:37,720 --> 01:25:41,441
They are mailed but did not notice anything.

844
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:47,001
Majesty, I beg you,
accordezmoi a moment.

845
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:53,801
Croyezmoi,
my wish is not to displease you.

846
01:25:53,960 --> 01:25:55,644
I've got a present.

847
01:25:56,680 --> 01:25:58,444
A family heirloom.

848
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:02,845
With us, they say

849
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,321
than that will take him to his wedding

850
01:26:05,480 --> 01:26:08,450
See all his wishes fulfilled.

851
01:26:18,200 --> 01:26:19,281
It is exquisite.

852
01:26:20,240 --> 01:26:22,686
There is no more beautiful in Europe.

853
01:26:23,080 --> 01:26:24,127
I will wear it.

854
01:26:24,280 --> 01:26:25,645
Your Majesty's gracious.

855
01:26:26,200 --> 01:26:29,568
I've delayed that too.
Excuse me.

856
01:26:29,960 --> 01:26:30,927
No, wait!

857
01:26:33,680 --> 01:26:34,727
Only...

858
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:39,601
What do you
extraordinary woman.

859
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:40,568
Yesterday.

860
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:43,086
Yes, yesterday!

861
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:45,925
Yesterday I saw the picture of my king.

862
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:47,730
You have escaped!

863
01:26:48,160 --> 01:26:49,286
Not you.

864
01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:53,609
I was afraid not to answer
your desires.

865
01:26:57,960 --> 01:26:59,803
In my desires?

866
01:27:14,120 --> 01:27:15,485
No message, ma'am.

867
01:27:16,040 --> 01:27:18,646
Should I send someone
the palace?

868
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:23,202
The king will not be long.

869
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:26,729
Bring champagne.

870
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:35,329
I want to be your wife

871
01:27:35,480 --> 01:27:38,324
and meet the requirements of your Majesty.

872
01:27:42,160 --> 01:27:43,400
My brother?

873
01:27:43,560 --> 01:27:45,324
What ressentezvous for him?

874
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:47,450
None.

875
01:27:48,280 --> 01:27:49,088
Nothing at all.

876
01:27:49,480 --> 01:27:51,244
It has yet  you made love.

877
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:53,729
I thought it was you.

878
01:27:54,160 --> 01:27:55,525
How could I guess?

879
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:03,684
RÃ©alisezvous
that you are aware of a great secret

880
01:28:04,160 --> 01:28:07,050
and it is worth more than the life of every man

881
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:08,168
or woman?

882
01:28:08,600 --> 01:28:11,285
It's all
for the Queen of France.

883
01:28:12,680 --> 01:28:13,567
And his life?

884
01:28:17,480 --> 01:28:19,050
What donneriezvous

885
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:21,081
to save?

886
01:28:22,040 --> 01:28:26,204
I marchanderais life of a man who humiliated me
?

887
01:28:28,080 --> 01:28:28,888
Come.

888
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:31,569
Closer look

889
01:28:32,160 --> 01:28:33,525
this "loyalty".

890
01:29:44,840 --> 01:29:45,568
Harlot!

891
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:08,805
Do stop that noise!

892
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:10,447
Stop!

893
01:30:10,640 --> 01:30:12,324
What a-til, madam?

894
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:14,084
What he has...

895
01:30:18,200 --> 01:30:20,168
I go to my room.

896
01:30:22,760 --> 01:30:25,889
I do not want to be disturbed
per person!

897
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:47,925
Dear Colbert

898
01:30:49,800 --> 01:30:52,246
luckily I've not missed.

899
01:30:53,720 --> 01:30:57,281
We both
rendezvous at the Bastille.

900
01:31:07,240 --> 01:31:08,127
Hurry !

901
01:31:20,080 --> 01:31:21,047
Come.

902
01:31:36,120 --> 01:31:37,565
What jouonsnous?

903
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:41,126
Do not be shy.

904
01:31:42,520 --> 01:31:44,727
We have all our time,
Majesty.

905
01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:47,882


906
01:31:48,040 --> 01:31:50,407
Any time
can imagine.

907
01:31:55,040 --> 01:31:56,804
Please be patient.

908
01:31:56,960 --> 01:31:59,281
I will make you happy.

909
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:06,609
Let's drink to love.

910
01:32:18,600 --> 01:32:19,886
This is an affront.

911
01:32:22,240 --> 01:32:25,528
Just a few questions as
celleci:

912
01:32:25,680 --> 01:32:27,648
did you saw that this afternoon?

913
01:32:31,880 --> 01:32:36,647
Speak, do not force us
to test yourselves.

914
01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:48,681
HÃ¢tezvous!

915
01:32:50,200 --> 01:32:52,043
Laissezmoi cover you.

916
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,207
It is Lahaut.
Hurry!

917
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:08,131
From beautiful work, dear.

918
01:33:08,280 --> 01:33:10,487
A we take over.

919
01:33:10,680 --> 01:33:12,728
Athos, looking for his clothes.

920
01:33:20,600 --> 01:33:21,681
Do you mind?

921
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:24,926
Keep your talents for later.

922
01:33:25,480 --> 01:33:27,926
I seem to remember...

923
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:47,160
Look at the trouble we take
to avoid any inconvenience.

924
01:33:56,440 --> 01:33:58,488
Then we go to practice.

925
01:33:58,640 --> 01:34:00,688
Where are the musketeers?

926
01:34:24,480 --> 01:34:25,322
Aramis

927
01:34:26,280 --> 01:34:28,601
go ahead,
take care of the lock.

928
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:30,809
Athos, the lantern.

929
01:34:49,240 --> 01:34:50,480
Blow a little.

930
01:34:55,560 --> 01:34:56,971
It may be helpful.

931
01:35:15,040 --> 01:35:15,802
Aramis!

932
01:35:20,280 --> 01:35:23,523
Think you can help
your young friend?

933
01:35:25,880 --> 01:35:27,803
Montronslui the impostor.

934
01:35:31,960 --> 01:35:33,644
Lowers lantern.

935
01:35:36,840 --> 01:35:40,003
Forward,
do not worry about your back!

936
01:35:53,160 --> 01:35:54,844


937
01:35:57,160 --> 01:35:58,571


938
01:36:08,320 --> 01:36:09,890
Do not wake him!

939
01:36:42,120 --> 01:36:44,248
Let's see if he likes this mask.

940
01:36:44,400 --> 01:36:45,606
Pass his arm.

941
01:37:03,480 --> 01:37:04,367
