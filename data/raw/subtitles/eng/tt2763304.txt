1
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,280
I'm afraid it's a no, Frank.

2
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:22,110
Well, well, well.

3
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:24,530
That's a body blow, I can tell you.

4
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,120
I am sorry.

5
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,040
A blow.

6
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,750
No two ways about that.

7
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,170
Five more years, eh?

8
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,250
What do they think I am?

9
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:39,170
They think I'm like one of those cunts
in the Bible that live forever?

10
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,470
Is that what they think?

11
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:43,970
-I'm not sure. They make an assessment.
-I've written letters, you know.

12
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:45,600
Letters to every cunt.
Even wrote to the Queen.

13
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:47,220
-You've written to the Queen?
-Aye.

14
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,140
Never got back to us, like.

15
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:51,940
Too fucking busy to speak
to the working classes.

16
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,480
Different story when she needs a soldier.

17
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:56,650
"Step this way, Mr. Begbie."
"Sign here, Mr. Begbie."

18
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:58,480
I didn't know you'd served in the army.

19
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,030
I haven't. How could I?

20
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:02,900
I've been in the fucking jail for 20 years.

21
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:05,120
-You not fucking notice?
-Of course, of course.

22
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,330
Diminished responsibility.

23
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,660
If that cunt in the original trial had put on

24
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:11,660
a proper defense
of diminished responsibility,

25
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,540
I could've walked out that door a free man.

26
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,380
I think, for you, that the best policy...

27
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:19,460
Did you mention it?

28
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,010
The diminished responsibility.
Did you mention it?

29
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,300
-At the hearing?
-Aye. Did you?

30
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:30,100
-I felt it was more constructive...
-Didn't fucking mention it.

31
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,600
I cannot believe it.

32
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:33,850
What was the last fucking thing I told you?

33
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:36,900
Mind and mention
the diminished responsibility,

34
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,860
you fucking dumb cunt!

35
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:43,740
I think it would be better
if we brought this meeting to a close,

36
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,410
and you and I get together

37
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:48,870
once you've had time
to reflect upon the situation.

38
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:53,870
So you gonna press
that little yellow button or no?

39
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,210
Cunt!

40
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,800
Daylight saving.

41
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,680
Me, I'm no one way or another
when it comes to daylight.

42
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:09,390
Like, neither a saver nor a spender.
More like just agnostic, you know?

43
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:14,140
Unfortunately, daylight hasn't shown
the same ambivalence towards me.

44
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,230
I had a job... Construction.

45
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,730
Laboring, a bit of carpentry,
a bit of plumbing now and again.

46
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:20,360
I mean, it wasn't my first choice of vocation,

47
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,690
but the cuts at the benefit office
made it clear.

48
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:24,610
No coal, no dole.

49
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:26,490
So, I'm off the skag.

50
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,740
I'm seeing Gail, little Fergus,
though he's not so little anymore,

51
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,080
but this was back then.

52
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,410
Basically, I'm holding it together.

53
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:37,170
Then, one morning, I gets to work
and gets fired for being an hour late.

54
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:40,540
And then, one hour late at the DSS
to explain why I lost the job.

55
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:43,250
And an hour late to appeal
against losing my benefits.

56
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,090
And an hour late
for my work-focused interview.

57
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:47,430
An hour late for
my supervised visit with little Fergus.

58
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:50,760
And late again to
social services to explain why.

59
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,810
Eventually, I let on to it. It was the clocks.

60
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:57,730
Going forward one hour.

61
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:01,480
British Summer Time, they calls it.

62
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:02,940
It wasn't even warm.

63
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,320
I was still wearing a jumper.

64
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:06,530
"Happens every year, Mr. Murphy."

65
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:09,160
How was I supposed to know?
I've been on skag for 15 years.

66
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,370
You know how it is...
Daylight isn't exactly high on your agenda

67
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:12,450
when you got a habit.

68
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:15,750
It's for farmers and that.
Dudes who need to tend to the livestock.

69
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:18,290
It's not for junkies who need to score.

70
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:20,670
So that was me. No job, no money.

71
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,500
No access to the little fella.

72
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:25,170
And then you went back on the heroin.

73
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:27,590
My best friend.

74
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:31,970
Actually, only friend who's never left us.

75
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,660
What is this?

76
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,450
-This is for you.
-What?

77
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:56,830
It's a recording.

78
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:00,580
A keepsake so the memory need never fade.

79
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:04,000
-Who are you?
-I'm your blackmailer.

80
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,840
And your salvation.

81
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:09,720
You cooperate with me,
no one will ever see this video.

82
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:12,430
Now, my research suggests that,

83
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:15,930
as deputy headmaster of one of
Edinburgh's leading private schools,

84
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:18,520
you earn, near enough, £70,000 per annum.

85
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,480
It's not in my interest
to squeeze you too hard,

86
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,770
and it's not in your interest to provoke me.

87
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:24,560
So let's meet in the middle.

88
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:28,780
10% of your salary per annum.
Paid monthly on a rolling, indefinite basis.

89
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:33,570
You disgusting shit! I will not stand for this!

90
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,540
Naturally, you'll have to lie to your wife.

91
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:40,910
If you need inspiration,
just imagine her reaction to that.

92
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:45,380
Or how this might interest
the pupils of that leading private school.

93
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:48,340
I think they might enjoy
the interlude with the strap-on.

94
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,880
I know I did.

95
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:55,390
I'm gonna text you the details
of a bank account.

96
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:58,520
I expect to see a £1,000 payment in there
by the end of the week.

97
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,410
Hi!

98
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:25,380
-Welcome to Edinburgh.
-Welcome to Edinburgh.

99
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,170
Welcome to Edinburgh.

100
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,010
Hi. Welcome to Edinburgh.

101
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,260
-Welcome to Edinburgh.
-Hi. Welcome to Edinburgh.

102
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,510
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

103
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:34,840
Where are you from?

104
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:36,800
-Slovenia.
-Oh.

105
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:25,640
Franco?

106
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,320
Franco.

107
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:32,980
Come on in.

108
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:38,110
All right?

109
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,320
-You ready?
-Aye.

110
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:40,830
You got it?

111
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,290
I hope you've not been fucking drinking.

112
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:45,080
-No, no way, Franco, man.
-Right.

113
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:48,830
Once here. Once here. Not too deep.

114
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,340
Just two little jabs. Bit of blood.

115
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,210
-No damage. All right?
-Right. No bother, Franco.

116
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,090
All right. All right, do it.

117
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:55,800
-Are you sure?
-Just fucking do it.

118
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,930
You fucking prick!

119
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:04,350
-You've stabbed us in the liver.
-Shit. Sorry, Franco.

120
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:06,480
Shit. You still want me to do the second one?

121
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,940
No, no, you're all right, Dozo, son.
I think you've done quite enough already.

122
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,360
Shit.

123
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:14,860
Fuck.

124
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:02,660
Grease me up.

125
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,030
Give it tight, though.

126
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,660
Slap it. Slap it.

127
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,550
Shit!

128
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,430
Hey! Hey! Don't fucking touch her!

129
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,980
Don't you fucking touch her.

130
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,350
You in this with her, are you?

131
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,480
You fuck! Fuck off!

132
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:42,860
I see you again, cunt, you fucking die.

133
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:44,740
Fuck off!

134
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:00,300
-Where were you?
-I was just next door.

135
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,470
You took a long time.

136
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,140
We should get a new clock.
This thing looks too obvious.

137
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,220
-I'm not doing this again.
-We'll take a break from it.

138
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:09,100
-Okay?
-No, Simon.

139
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,480
I said I'm not doing this.

140
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,640
I feel sick.

141
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,060
Well, calm down, okay?

142
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,560
Worked the first time okay, didn't it?

143
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:17,610
-I'm going back to work for Doyle.
-Doyle?

144
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,650
No, no, no, you're not doing that.
Not in the sauna.

145
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:21,150
-Why not?
-Doyle's a gangster.

146
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:25,320
In the sauna, no man would dare
to hurt a woman.

147
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,120
Mr. Doyle won't let that happen.

148
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,830
I don't like to think
of you working there, okay?

149
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,500
Why not? Because I fuck men?

150
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:33,330
How is this better?

151
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:35,420
I could have been killed
and you would have done nothing

152
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,340
because you were sitting next door,
taking cocaine.

153
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:42,170
Please, I want to go home.

154
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,360
It was very peaceful at the end.

155
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:10,990
She kept your room exactly how you left it.

156
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:15,830
She always hoped
you'd come back someday.

157
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:30,950
"Gail.

158
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:35,870
"I wish that I could find
better words today to tell you I'm sorry.

159
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:40,460
"You shouldn't have to read this,
because I already made you suffer too much.

160
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:43,090
"But I know that you and Fergus

161
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:45,920
"are living in a better world
without all my chaos.

162
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:49,470
"I'm sorry for all the things I destroyed.

163
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,850
"You are so beautiful.

164
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,430
"The most beautiful in the world.

165
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,480
"And I only ever made this world ugly.

166
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,110
"Fergus needs things to be simpler.

167
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:03,820
"I know how embarrassed he is about me.

168
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:08,240
"I could not be the man that you both need.

169
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:13,660
"I've tried and tried and tried for 20 years,
and everything I try is another disaster.

170
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:14,830
"I love you.

171
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,370
"I love Fergus more than anything.

172
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,120
"But I'm finished, Gail.

173
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,500
"I'm sorry.

174
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:21,920
"Love you both.

175
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,380
"I want to see you both smile again.

176
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:27,460
"Danny boy."

177
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:01,040
Fuck.

178
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,250
Spud!

179
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,430
Spud.

180
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:34,530
Spud!

181
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:42,410
Spud.

182
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,580
Fucking hell!

183
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:47,750
Fuck!

184
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:54,590
Fuck!

185
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,560
Fuck.

186
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,400
You!

187
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,520
-You, you bastard!
-What?

188
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:11,150
What the fuck are you doing to me?

189
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:13,780
I was just fucking saving your life!

190
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:15,530
Save my life?

191
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:20,950
You ruined my fucking life, Mark.
You ruined it!

192
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:24,460
Now you're ruining my fucking death, too!

193
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,460
Thanks a lot, amigo.

194
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:29,000
Fucking shit! I did what I could for you!

195
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:31,000
I gave you £4,000!

196
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:36,890
What did you think
I was gonna do with £4,000, Mark?

197
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:39,430
I was a fucking junkie!

198
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,140
Aye, suppose you were.

199
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,020
I still am!

200
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,860
Fuck's sake.

201
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:05,790
You're looking well, though, Mark.

202
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:08,710
Aye.

203
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:10,960
Everyone says that.

204
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,550
Gonna be sticking around for a while?

205
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,840
No, I'm supposed to go back
in a couple of days.

206
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:17,630
Can you not stay a bit longer?

207
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:21,720
It'd be nice to see you, get to, you know,
spend some time together.

208
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:23,260
I don't know. I don't know.

209
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:25,350
I missed you, man.

210
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:29,060
Don't go trying to kill yourself again, eh?

211
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:32,770
No. Not while I got my friend in town, eh?

212
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,360
So...

213
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,030
You see old Simon?

214
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,620
Simon? No, no. He's probably too busy.

215
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:45,410
You got to see old Simon, man.

216
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,790
You know how it was, Spud.

217
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:51,080
You and Simon was like that, man.

218
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,300
Hello, Frank.
How are you feeling this morning?

219
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:55,800
A bit sore, doll.

220
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,220
Well, I'm sure we'll soon
be able to get rid of these tubes.

221
00:18:58,550 --> 00:18:59,840
Thanks, darling.

222
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,390
Give us your wrist, Frank. I'm off for a dump.

223
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:10,770
Come on. Give us a break.

224
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:12,150
That's the regulations, Frank.

225
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:15,070
Where the fuck am I going to go,
all these tubes stuck to me?

226
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,820
Give a man a little bit of dignity for once, eh?

227
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:19,900
Aye.

228
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:21,490
All right, Frank.

229
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:24,910
You're a good man, Mr. Wilson.

230
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,540
I respect you for that.

231
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,420
Ya fucking prick.

232
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:56,320
Excuse me, sir.

233
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:57,980
Are you all right?

234
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,450
-Can I help?
-Aye. You can.

235
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:52,500
Hello, Mark.

236
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:55,380
Simon.

237
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,840
So, what you been up to for 20 years?

238
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,140
I've been in Amsterdam.

239
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:08,680
-Nice.
-All right.

240
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,640
What else? Married?

241
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:11,980
Aye.

242
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,600
-Nice.
-Dutch woman.

243
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:16,400
-Kids?
-Two.

244
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,650
-Boys or girls?
-One of each.

245
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,030
Little Mark, eh?

246
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:25,660
Bet he's a chip off the old block.

247
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,120
James, actually.

248
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:29,030
And Laura.

249
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:32,000
How about you?

250
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:34,870
I have a son.

251
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:37,790
He's in London with
his fucking whore mother.

252
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,340
-See him?
-Pretty regular.

253
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:44,260
Currently once every 10 years.

254
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:47,090
All right.

255
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,800
Job?

256
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:50,970
Aye.

257
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:53,390
I did an accounting course.

258
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:55,060
I work for a small business.

259
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:59,230
Stock management software
for the retail sector.

260
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:00,570
Very nice.

261
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:04,650
Well, as you can see,
I'm running my old auntie's pub.

262
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:07,570
Very few customers
and they don't spend much.

263
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:10,370
Sometimes it's not even worth opening.

264
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:13,870
The great wave of gentrification
has yet to engulf us.

265
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,910
But there we go, eh?

266
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,500
-My lot in life.
-I see.

267
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:25,220
£16,000!

268
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:27,930
You thieving fucking bastard!

269
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:30,550
You missed a trick!
That's what hurts, isn't it?

270
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:34,970
That I had the brains and the fucking balls
to steal the money and you didn't!

271
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:38,060
Fucking get off me.

272
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:48,450
-Fucking hell!
-Bastard.

273
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:56,120
Shit! Fuck!

274
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,620
You fucking bastard.

275
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:41,370
Are you all right?

276
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:45,710
It will be fine.

277
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,140
Where is she?

278
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:01,980
None of your business.

279
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,610
Saved your life, though.

280
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,330
This is for you.

281
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,040
Fuck's sake.

282
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:27,000
We did a deal back then.

283
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:28,800
Twenty years ago.

284
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:32,090
Couple of bags of H. Good quality stuff.

285
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:35,220
We took it to London.
Me, him, Begbie, Spud Murphy.

286
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,390
Sold it.

287
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:37,760
Not a bad price.

288
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:41,060
£16,000, to be divided in four equal parts.

289
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,770
He ran off with it.

290
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:44,350
Took it all.

291
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,900
And now what does he think I am, a whore?

292
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:48,230
He can just pay me off?

293
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,570
£4,000, not even any interest.

294
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:53,910
What am I supposed to do with that?
Buy a fucking time machine?

295
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,620
Live my life all over again?

296
00:24:55,700 --> 00:25:00,250
Only this time without being robbed
and betrayed by my best fucking friend!

297
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:04,250
No, it doesn't work like that.

298
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:07,540
What I'm gonna do, Veronika,

299
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:13,090
is I'm gonna draw him back in as my friend,
my very best friend, my partner,

300
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:14,430
and then I'm gonna hurt him.

301
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:17,430
I'm gonna hurt him in every way that I can.

302
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,140
-£200 short.
-I owed someone.

303
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:23,350
Yeah, you bought cocaine.

304
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,810
Shut it.

305
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:28,940
Veronika...

306
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,190
I'm gonna make him sorry he ever came back.

307
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:57,510
Shut up! What's the fucking matter with you?

308
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:58,720
Frank, is that you?

309
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,010
Who the fuck else it gonna be?

310
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:01,970
But the police might be watching.

311
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:04,810
Well, that's why I came
in the back window, woman.

312
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:06,140
Do you still got my kitbag?

313
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:07,270
-Of course.
-Good.

314
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:11,820
Frank, you're bleeding.

315
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:14,320
It's nothing.
Just get us a plaster or something.

316
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:19,070
Here, let me.

317
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,160
No, leave it, leave it.

318
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,330
Dad?

319
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,950
Franco Junior.

320
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:27,670
Ya cunt, you.

321
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,250
Ya fucking beauty.

322
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:31,630
But, Dad...

323
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:32,750
That's right, son.

324
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:34,590
I'm home.

325
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,760
But what are you gonna do?

326
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,340
Well, I'm not gonna be sitting on me ass

327
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,050
watching fucking telly all day.
That's for sure.

328
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,010
-Frank, what if...
-No, no, listen.

329
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,100
You and me, son. You and me.

330
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:48,270
We're gonna go out there
and do a bit of business together.

331
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,900
I've enrolled in college, Dad.

332
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:56,030
-What?
-I'm doing a diploma in hotel management.

333
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:01,870
Good one. Fucking... Fucking had us there.

334
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,620
Seriously, son, you and me, you and me.

335
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:06,040
That's it.

336
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:09,250
Look at him, June. Look at our boy.

337
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:11,790
He cannot fucking wait.

338
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:19,220
Fuck!

339
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:27,430
Never mind, Frank.

340
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:32,060
It's just great to have you back.

341
00:27:57,170 --> 00:27:58,170
I'm getting builders.

342
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,050
Look.

343
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:02,390
These are partitions. Eight rooms.

344
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,260
Sixteen girls. Two shifts.

345
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,980
We could be turning over £10,000 a week
every week of the year.

346
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:12,730
-So, where's my office?
-What?

347
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:16,360
I'll need an office
if I am to be Madame Veronika.

348
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:18,320
All right.

349
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:20,150
Your office...

350
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:22,990
Is there.

351
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:24,450
You have money for all this?

352
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:29,120
I'm gonna find the money
and I'm gonna do this for you.

353
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,620
But when, Simon?

354
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,120
I cannot live on a promise.

355
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:35,710
Soon.

356
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,300
I promise.

357
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,490
Come on, Spud!

358
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,500
I'm with you, Mark. Go on, Mark.

359
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,750
Almost halfway, Spud. Come on.

360
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,190
Thanks, brother.

361
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:38,860
Can't fail again, Mark.

362
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:41,110
You know, I need to detox the system.

363
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:43,240
Spud. "Detox the system."

364
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:46,110
What does that even mean?
It doesn't mean anything.

365
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,820
It's not getting it out of your body
that's the problem.

366
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:50,200
It's getting it out of your mind.
You are an addict.

367
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,870
You think I haven't heard that
100,000 times, Mark?

368
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:55,710
You got 12 more steps for me, comrade?

369
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:58,340
So be addicted.
Be addicted to something else.

370
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,960
Like running until I feel sick?

371
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:01,250
Yes.

372
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:02,880
Or something else.

373
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,130
You've got to channel it.
You've got to control it.

374
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,720
People try all sorts.

375
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,390
Some people do boxing.

376
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:11,890
-Boxing?
-Well, it's just an example.

377
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:14,060
I don't... I don't mean you should...

378
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:17,600
So, what did you channel it into?

379
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:21,070
Getting away.

380
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:31,200
Do you remember, Mark...
You remember that girl, Sharron?

381
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,910
Lived in Granton.

382
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:35,000
Tall.

383
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:38,210
-Well, taller than us anyway, at the time.
-Yeah, I remember her.

384
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,920
Your very first sexual encounter.

385
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:43,420
-Right.
-Mine too.

386
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:44,920
Okay.

387
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,680
You remember shoplifting
in Woolworths together

388
00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:48,760
and you got caught, you gave my name?

389
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:51,100
-Yeah.
-How about this one?

390
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:53,560
Warm day, sunny afternoon.

391
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:59,600
Two young lads, and we clubbed together
and bought our very first hit off Swanney.

392
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:00,940
Our very first bag of heroin.

393
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:02,520
-Do you remember that?
-Yes.

394
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:05,690
-Swanney's dead now, of course.
-Be astonished if he wasn't.

395
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:08,780
And we went down that park,
back of Banana Flats.

396
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,820
-Dog shit park.
-Yeah.

397
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:13,620
And we shared a needle.

398
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,120
Shared a needle, yeah.

399
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:18,960
You went first.

400
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:21,790
Your blood runs in my veins, Mark.

401
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:26,970
Would you stop looking
at your fucking watch?

402
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:29,470
-I have a flight to catch.
-Shit.

403
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,140
Excuse me a moment.

404
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:37,810
Fuck.

405
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,810
Fuck!

406
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:43,650
So you're Plan B.

407
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:46,940
Yes.

408
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:52,200
I am to persuade you to stay and help him.

409
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:56,870
It will mean so much to have
his oldest friend by his side

410
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:59,290
in this exciting new business opportunity.

411
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,120
He told you to say that.

412
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,500
Yes.

413
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:05,090
Did he choose your dress?

414
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:06,250
No.

415
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:08,380
-You like it?
-It's very nice.

416
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:09,760
Is he taking cocaine in there?

417
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:12,510
Probably.

418
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:15,060
Is he doing that a lot?

419
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:17,470
As often as he can.

420
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,150
-Where is he?
-Gone.

421
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:30,110
Gone? How could you let him go?

422
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:32,360
Simon.

423
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:36,700
Simon!

424
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:39,660
How could you let him go?

425
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:42,330
I'm not finished yet.
I'm not finished with him!

426
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,960
The fuck are you staring at?

427
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:51,930
Cunt robbed me of £16,000.

428
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,820
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen,

429
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:11,400
and welcome to Jet2.com
Flight 0511 to Amsterdam.

430
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,600
I'm getting divorced.

431
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:50,320
You just came back to tell me that?

432
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:53,780
Of course, any misfortune which befalls you
is music to my ears.

433
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,780
I was supposed to go back
and move my stuff out.

434
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:56,950
She owns the apartment.

435
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,240
-And the children?
-There aren't any.

436
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,950
-None?
-No.

437
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:08,080
So when you said wife, two kids...
James and...

438
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:10,460
-Laura.
-Laura, that wasn't strictly true?

439
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,170
-No.
-Why'd you lie to me?

440
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:14,130
'Cause I didn't want to tell you the truth.

441
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:20,310
And the no-kids thing, was...
Was that a problem?

442
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,640
It's none of your business.

443
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:26,810
Yes, it was a problem.
It was a fucking big problem.

444
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:29,270
-All right? That make you happy?
-A little bit.

445
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,650
Oh, fuck off.

446
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:35,240
It's all over, the marriage. Fifteen years.

447
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:38,320
And then the company I work for,
that's merging with another.

448
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:40,450
There'll be no room for me.
Not enough qualifications.

449
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,000
I can see that coming.
I don't need to wait for the fucking letter.

450
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:48,580
And then three months ago,
I suffered what I've been told was a...

451
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:51,800
An episode of acute coronary insufficiency.

452
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,920
Like a heart attack.

453
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:55,880
They put a tube in here.

454
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:59,300
And I've got a metal stent
in my left coronary artery.

455
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:01,510
Good as new, apparently. Good as new.

456
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:03,680
Should last another 30 years, they said,

457
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:06,390
but they didn't say what to do
with those 30 years.

458
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,400
Two or three, fine, I'll take that.
I can cope with that.

459
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,560
I can think of enough things to do
to piss away what remains.

460
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:15,240
But 30? What am I supposed to do with that?

461
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,610
I'm 46 and I'm fucked!

462
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:20,870
I've got no home.
I've got nowhere that I think of as a home.

463
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:22,700
I don't really know anyone.

464
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:25,870
And what's the substance
of our acquaintance?

465
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:27,120
Friendship, please.

466
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:29,500
You ask me to get involved
in some stupid scheme

467
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:32,540
to finance and establish and run a brothel.

468
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:33,880
Sauna, please.

469
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,760
-A brothel.
-Well...

470
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:39,380
The sad thing is...
The most pathetic thing of all

471
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:42,050
is that I can't think of anything better.

472
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:47,730
So you're gonna help me? Find the money?

473
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:50,230
-Where's Veronika?
-She's not here.

474
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,650
She doesn't really like staying over.

475
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:54,320
She complains that it's a mess,
all that sort of thing.

476
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,070
-Does she?
-Yeah.

477
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,240
-Not why you stayed, is it?
-What?

478
00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:00,740
-Her, Veronika.
-No, of course not.

479
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:02,120
No? 'Cause she's my girlfriend.

480
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,700
-Yeah, I know that.
-Good.

481
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:11,040
-It's not a mess, is it?
-No. It's just masculine.

482
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,090
What is this?

483
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,350
Come here.

484
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:34,810
Just do exactly what I told you.
You'll be fine.

485
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:55,420
Grab anything you can carry.
Get the telly at the end.

486
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,130
Go!

487
00:36:57,170 --> 00:36:58,920
-There?
-Shut up.

488
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:10,270
-Fuck's sake!
-I'm sorry.

489
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,690
Who's there?

490
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,650
Hello?

491
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:18,360
What the fuck's going on down here?

492
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,250
What the fuck?

493
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:33,620
-I'm sorry.
-Cunt!

494
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:50,430
Ya cunt, you! You fucking beauty, you!

495
00:37:52,810 --> 00:37:53,890
How you doing, Mikey?

496
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:57,860
Hey. Bring in the telly.

497
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,690
Who's this, then?

498
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:03,280
This big handsome bastard
is none other than my son.

499
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:06,030
Franco Junior, meet Mikey Forrester.

500
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:09,580
-So you're teaching him the trade?
-He's a little bit to learn though, eh?

501
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:11,160
Well, you're in the right hands, son.

502
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:13,120
He's got the talent, I'll tell you that.

503
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,290
We had a spot of bother.

504
00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:17,380
Concerned citizen came down the stairs,
fucking tooled up and all.

505
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,000
I was on the back foot, I can tell you.

506
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:22,130
But Franco Junior here
took him out and no mistake.

507
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:23,920
Well, no, it wasn't quite like that.

508
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:27,140
Takes after his old man, eh?

509
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:28,550
Don't you?

510
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,850
-Cheers, boys.
-See you again.

511
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:37,230
I covered up for you there.

512
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,730
-I'm sorry, Dad.
-See, if that happens again,

513
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:42,440
son or no son,
it's gonna be a fucking kicking, right?

514
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:43,740
Right, Dad.

515
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:46,610
Right. Come on.

516
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,630
Never mind, Frank.

517
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:10,350
Oh, fucking shut up.

518
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:18,020
A light had shone in the night

519
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:20,900
Somewhere ahead

520
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:26,440
And blue had turned into green

521
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,450
Then it was red...

522
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,240
This place is a goldmine. It's a certainty.

523
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:35,540
I mean, these are people who've been
abandoned by their political class.

524
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:39,120
But at least they have what we don't...
A sense of identity.

525
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:40,960
Right, come on, let's get it over with.

526
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,550
An identity encapsulated in four digits.

527
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,260
If we're not back in an hour, call the police.

528
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:49,380
-What shall I say?
-Just tell them we're dead.

529
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,800
Each machine seemed to say

530
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:56,470
As I walked round and round
the penny arcade

531
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:59,600
And just ring the bell on the big bagatelle...

532
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:02,860
The Battle of the Boyne
was fought on the 11th of July, 1690,

533
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:06,570
between two rival claimants of
the British and Irish thrones,

534
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:08,490
James II, Catholic,

535
00:40:08,570 --> 00:40:10,570
and William of Orange, Protestant.

536
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:15,330
The battle was decisive.
The Protestants won.

537
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:20,710
But 400 years later,
the uncompromising and victorious loyalists

538
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:24,670
now feel estranged from the
modern, secular United Kingdom.

539
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:28,420
Let me tell you that I love you

540
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:31,930
And I think about you all the time

541
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:34,970
The sectarian songs have been banned,

542
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:39,310
but they still gather
and remain loyal to the victory of 1690,

543
00:40:39,350 --> 00:40:41,690
and to a simpler, less tolerant time.

544
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:47,360
It's the greatest sight that I have ever seen

545
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,360
You are a red hot

546
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:55,280
You're a red hot dancer

547
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:59,290
When you swing your hips
And you do the salsa

548
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:03,330
Rock forward and back
Then you do it again

549
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:06,040
Take a grapevine to the right...

550
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:09,210
But if nothing else,
history has shown us very clearly

551
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,050
these are people
whom it is unwise to provoke.

552
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:15,510
You aren't from 'round here,
are you, lads?

553
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:20,060
You not gonna give us a song?

554
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:26,310
I can sing. I'll just...
I'll just fucking make something up.

555
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,570
You can play the piano.

556
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,070
I can't play the fucking piano.

557
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:30,320
You know those two chords.

558
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,740
The fucking F and G march
you used to play at school.

559
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:33,820
Do that.

560
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:38,160
Good evening.

561
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:42,120
My mate and I would like to

562
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:45,330
sing a song that we wrote.

563
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:47,960
No.

564
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,930
Is... Is that it?

565
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:01,980
It was the year of 1690

566
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:07,860
On the 11th of July

567
00:42:09,770 --> 00:42:13,740
Or the first in Julian calendar

568
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:14,900
Wait, wait, wait.

569
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:16,950
Give me something with a little bit of rhythm.

570
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:26,670
Here we go.

571
00:42:29,790 --> 00:42:32,170
It was on the field of battle

572
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:35,300
Of hope we were bereft

573
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:38,010
But by the time that it was over

574
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:43,810
There were no more Catholics left

575
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:01,740
We looked up to King William

576
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:03,790
On his chin a royal cleft

577
00:43:03,830 --> 00:43:08,420
And by the time that it was over
There were no more Catholics left

578
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:11,670
Aye! Fucking right.

579
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:19,430
His strategy was strong
His strategy was deft

580
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:24,220
By the time that it was over
There were no more Catholics left

581
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:31,310
The battle now victorious
We foiled his papist theft

582
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:35,610
When the time was over
There were no more Catholics left

583
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:38,280
Aye!

584
00:43:38,910 --> 00:43:40,570
No more Catholics

585
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:42,370
No more Catholics

586
00:43:42,450 --> 00:43:44,410
No more Catholics

587
00:43:44,490 --> 00:43:46,040
No more Catholics

588
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:47,910
No more Catholics

589
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,710
No more Catholics

590
00:43:49,790 --> 00:43:51,630
No more Catholics

591
00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:53,380
No more Catholics

592
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:55,460
-No more
-No more

593
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:57,220
-No more
-No more

594
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:59,090
-No more
-No more

595
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:00,890
-No more
-No more

596
00:44:00,970 --> 00:44:02,720
-No more
-No more

597
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:05,970
No more Catholics left

598
00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:11,600
Thank you very much. Good night.

599
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,240
Just fucking drive.

600
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:30,540
One-six-nine-zero.

601
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:33,130
One-six-nine-zero.

602
00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:36,300
Sixteen-ninety.

603
00:44:38,970 --> 00:44:40,010
-Nope.
-Nope.

604
00:44:43,930 --> 00:44:45,470
And it's midnight.

605
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:46,640
Start again.

606
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:55,570
So, there's this room service guy, right?

607
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:57,530
And he comes into the room,
and there is Georgie Best

608
00:44:57,610 --> 00:44:59,820
lying on the bed with two Playboy models.

609
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:02,030
Three in a bed, champagne
and a little bit of Charlie,

610
00:45:02,110 --> 00:45:03,780
and there's banknotes.

611
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:05,740
But they're lying on the banknotes.

612
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:07,080
-Lying on the money?
-Yes.

613
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:08,200
-Why?
-I don't know.

614
00:45:08,290 --> 00:45:09,290
Because he has a lot of money.

615
00:45:09,370 --> 00:45:11,620
Or at least he had
a lot of money at the time, anyway.

616
00:45:11,670 --> 00:45:13,880
The room service guy, he comes in,

617
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:15,710
and he sees this scene
that I just described to you,

618
00:45:15,790 --> 00:45:17,050
and he says, "George Best..."

619
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:19,050
Greatest footballer of all time.

620
00:45:19,130 --> 00:45:21,680
Exactly. "The greatest footballer of all time,
I have to ask you,

621
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:23,590
"'Where did it all go wrong?'"

622
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:27,470
Where did it all go wrong?

623
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:28,770
Where did it all go wrong?

624
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:31,560
-Where did it all go wrong, George Best?
-Yeah, but...

625
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:36,270
I think that the room service guy, you know...
I think he makes a very good point.

626
00:45:36,770 --> 00:45:37,860
No?

627
00:45:43,150 --> 00:45:45,280
He played for Hibs in 1979

628
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:47,780
between stints for
the Fort Lauderdale Strikers

629
00:45:47,830 --> 00:45:49,540
and the San Jose Earthquakes.

630
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:52,000
I went to see him play, apparently.
My dad took me.

631
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:54,210
He said, "You've got to see this.
You've got to see this player.

632
00:45:54,290 --> 00:45:56,630
"Got to see this greatest footballer
of all time."

633
00:45:56,670 --> 00:46:00,630
So it was a big game, it was a big crowd,
and a big guy in front of me.

634
00:46:00,670 --> 00:46:03,010
I couldn't see a thing. Not a single thing.

635
00:46:03,050 --> 00:46:04,130
Not for 90 minutes.

636
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:06,010
But I've got the program, so...

637
00:46:06,050 --> 00:46:07,510
I mean, I've always got that, you know?

638
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:09,890
Thin. Thin. Nobody was fat back then.

639
00:46:09,970 --> 00:46:11,430
It's not just the football, is it?

640
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,390
-It's the end of austerity.
-There was no such thing even

641
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:15,350
-as a calorie till 1974.
-Welcome to the new age of

642
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,560
-civil rights, space exploration.
-You know what happened in 1974?

643
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:18,690
The first McDonald's in the UK.

644
00:46:18,730 --> 00:46:19,860
He's basically John Barry
with football boots.

645
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:21,990
See, look at that guy.
He would be scrawny today.

646
00:46:22,030 --> 00:46:23,570
A great, swaggering, filthy piece of music.

647
00:46:23,650 --> 00:46:26,200
-But then... That was totally normal till 1974.
-It's insurrection!

648
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:28,490
-That's the beauty of what he does.
-You know what happened in 1974?

649
00:46:28,530 --> 00:46:29,910
First McDonald's. South London. Woolwich.

650
00:46:29,990 --> 00:46:31,700
These are not goals.
These are political statements.

651
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:33,370
It's still there.
I've been there myself several times.

652
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:36,210
You know nothing. You understand nothing.

653
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:38,040
You live in the past.

654
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:40,050
Where I come from

655
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:42,260
the past is something to forget

656
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:44,260
but here it's all you talk about.

657
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:47,180
You are clearly so in love with each other

658
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:49,680
that I feel awkward in your company.

659
00:46:50,010 --> 00:46:51,720
Instead of looking at me

660
00:46:51,770 --> 00:46:53,220
you should get naked and fuck each other.

661
00:46:54,730 --> 00:46:55,730
Cheers.

662
00:46:55,770 --> 00:46:57,310
-Up your ass.
-Placebo.

663
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:00,070
-There's a fucking...
-Do it. Let's do it.

664
00:47:16,370 --> 00:47:18,040
Fuck off.

665
00:47:36,390 --> 00:47:38,270
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

666
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,080
Jab.

667
00:48:42,630 --> 00:48:43,880
Double jab.

668
00:48:44,290 --> 00:48:45,750
Double jab, right hand.

669
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:47,380
One, two.

670
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:45,420
Junior. You coming, for fuck's sake?

671
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:47,750
-Frank.
-What? What is it now?

672
00:50:47,790 --> 00:50:49,960
-The boy.
-What about him?

673
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,800
See, Frank, please don't be angry.
It's just, he's not really...

674
00:50:53,210 --> 00:50:54,470
"Not really," what?

675
00:50:58,890 --> 00:51:00,060
Sorry, Dad.

676
00:51:00,970 --> 00:51:02,180
The fuck is that?

677
00:51:02,270 --> 00:51:04,430
You cannot go with me dressed like that.

678
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:07,980
See, I don't really think, you know, I'm into it.

679
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:11,230
-He doesn't want to go, Frank.
-Doesn't want to go?

680
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:13,280
Where else you gonna go?

681
00:51:13,650 --> 00:51:17,360
I was actually gonna go
and meet some friends from the college.

682
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:19,820
From the college, is it?

683
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:22,080
Right.

684
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:24,620
Well, that's a blow and no mistake,
no two ways about that.

685
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:25,660
Sorry, Dad.

686
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:26,920
Some way to treat your old man.

687
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,790
-Please, Frank.
-You shut the fuck up!

688
00:51:29,830 --> 00:51:32,420
Hotel fucking management.
You put him up to this.

689
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:33,670
Dad, it's not like that.

690
00:51:33,710 --> 00:51:35,720
Shut the fuck up! "Dad."

691
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:39,340
Maybe I'm not your dad.

692
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:42,100
-I see it now.
-No, Frank.

693
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:44,850
-Dad, leave it.
-"Leave it"? I don't want to fucking leave it!

694
00:51:44,930 --> 00:51:48,900
What if I don't want to fucking leave it?
What you gonna do about that, eh?

695
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:51,110
Tell you what... Free pop.

696
00:51:51,190 --> 00:51:53,150
-No, Frank!
-Shut it.

697
00:51:54,190 --> 00:51:55,360
Come on.

698
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:57,070
Stick one on then, you cunt.

699
00:51:57,900 --> 00:52:00,660
Take a fucking swipe at me. Do it.

700
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:01,990
Do it!

701
00:52:03,910 --> 00:52:06,250
No, you cannot fucking do that.

702
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:10,630
See, if you were my son,
you'd have stabbed us there.

703
00:52:11,330 --> 00:52:13,960
I'd be lying, breathing my last
through a hole in my chest.

704
00:52:14,050 --> 00:52:16,460
But you cannot fucking do that.

705
00:52:49,410 --> 00:52:50,920
What do you want?

706
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:06,770
-Yep.
-Mark.

707
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:08,310
What?

708
00:53:08,390 --> 00:53:09,640
Need a lawyer.

709
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:14,310
So, as I understand it,
the complainant, a deputy headmaster,

710
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:18,150
alleges that he's been
the victim of attempted extortion.

711
00:53:18,230 --> 00:53:19,820
How does Sick Boy intend to plead?

712
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:22,160
It's actually "Simon" these days.

713
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,410
Right. Simon.

714
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:28,080
I see. Not guilty.

715
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:30,290
Fine.

716
00:53:30,910 --> 00:53:32,080
Off the record,

717
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:35,540
the police have told me that the USB drive
does have Simon's prints on it

718
00:53:35,630 --> 00:53:37,090
and that in searching the flat,

719
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:39,300
they found the mobile
that the bank details were sent from.

720
00:53:41,010 --> 00:53:42,130
Right.

721
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:43,890
As well as the cocaine, of course.

722
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:46,180
Well, that was just for personal use.

723
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:47,640
Quite a lot for personal use.

724
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:48,680
Well, you know Simon.

725
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:51,140
I certainly remember him.

726
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:54,100
-Does he still take heroin?
-No.

727
00:53:54,150 --> 00:53:55,520
Do you?

728
00:53:56,860 --> 00:53:58,860
No. Not for 20 years.

729
00:54:00,150 --> 00:54:01,320
That's really good.

730
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:03,150
Well done.

731
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:08,700
So, are you the woman in the video?

732
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:10,410
My face is not seen.

733
00:54:10,870 --> 00:54:13,040
Do you have any identifying marks?

734
00:54:13,830 --> 00:54:15,790
Tattoos on your buttocks?

735
00:54:16,330 --> 00:54:17,420
Certainly not.

736
00:54:17,590 --> 00:54:18,710
On your perineum?

737
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:26,550
It's the bit of skin
between your vagina and your bumhole.

738
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:29,390
That's disgusting.

739
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:31,350
So you're not vajazzled.

740
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:35,730
May I ask,
what is your relationship with the accused?

741
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:38,020
We are friends.

742
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:40,320
Mark?

743
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:45,910
I really don't have anything else to add.

744
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:48,910
Well...

745
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:51,200
Perhaps we have a defense.

746
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:55,210
Simon may claim that
the recording was consensual,

747
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:57,630
was, in fact,
commissioned by the complainant.

748
00:54:57,710 --> 00:54:59,420
Hence the request for payment.

749
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:03,210
He pleads guilty on the cocaine,
which, remarkably, is a first offense,

750
00:55:03,260 --> 00:55:08,050
enters into an approved rehab,
£1,000 fine, six months suspended.

751
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:09,550
This consultation is free.

752
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:12,600
Should we go forward, here's the cost.

753
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:14,390
Well, that's very reasonable.

754
00:55:15,230 --> 00:55:16,440
It's an hourly rate.

755
00:55:19,230 --> 00:55:20,230
'Course.

756
00:55:20,730 --> 00:55:22,070
Thanks.

757
00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:25,900
Mark.

758
00:55:30,030 --> 00:55:32,080
She's too young for you.

759
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:45,090
Here it is.
"EU Small Business Development Loans.

760
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:47,380
"Zero-interest loans distributed regionally

761
00:55:47,430 --> 00:55:51,930
"towards projects that stimulate regeneration
of formerly industrial areas.

762
00:55:51,970 --> 00:55:55,060
"Loans are available of up to £100,000.

763
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:56,940
"Applications should be made online,

764
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:59,770
"which may be followed by an invitation
to present a business plan."

765
00:55:59,850 --> 00:56:01,270
Blah, blah, fucking blah.

766
00:56:01,610 --> 00:56:03,110
I'm trying to help you, Simon.

767
00:56:03,150 --> 00:56:05,320
We're blowing all that
cashpoint money on lawyer's fees.

768
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:07,030
You could've got someone cheaper.

769
00:56:07,110 --> 00:56:10,950
Well, I wouldn't have had to get anyone at all
if you hadn't engaged in fucking blackmail.

770
00:56:11,490 --> 00:56:13,620
Is there anything left of your £4,000
I gave you?

771
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:15,500
No, I've got expenses, just like everyone else.

772
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:17,120
What, all of it?

773
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:19,290
You snorted the whole fucking wad?

774
00:56:19,370 --> 00:56:21,750
It's called debt, Mark.

775
00:56:21,790 --> 00:56:25,380
The point is, we need cash now,
not in six months' time.

776
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:27,220
And you realize what's at stake here?

777
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:29,470
I promised to set up a sauna for Veronika.

778
00:56:29,510 --> 00:56:32,050
And if I don't get it up and running soon,
she's gonna leave me.

779
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:34,640
-Fucking leave you anyway.
-No, it's not gonna happen.

780
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:37,180
-Is she actually even with you?
-She's my girlfriend.

781
00:56:37,270 --> 00:56:38,640
You've never even fucked her.

782
00:56:38,730 --> 00:56:40,600
I have fucked her, and I'll fuck her again.

783
00:56:40,650 --> 00:56:43,110
-What? When she was working at the sauna?
-That's not fair.

784
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:45,070
You know, since we're having
this conversation,

785
00:56:45,150 --> 00:56:48,610
I can tell you that fully consensual,
emotionally driven, not-for-profit

786
00:56:48,650 --> 00:56:50,450
sexual intercourse has been attained.

787
00:56:50,660 --> 00:56:51,870
Simon, you're a romantic.

788
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:54,740
Veronika and I have had our rough patches.
I'll be the first to admit that.

789
00:56:54,830 --> 00:56:56,410
Shall we submit this application?

790
00:56:56,490 --> 00:56:58,960
Do what you want,
but I need someone on-site working.

791
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,330
I need progress.

792
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:01,830
Now.

793
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,170
All right, Spud, we're upstairs.

794
00:57:04,250 --> 00:57:06,300
-All right, Mark.
-Come in.

795
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:12,180
When clients come in,
I want a sense of space.

796
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:13,720
Yeah.

797
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:18,520
Maybe some soft lighting, help punters feel
a bit more relaxed and that, you know?

798
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:22,150
Exactly. I'm so glad
that someone understands.

799
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:30,700
And they're off and racing.

800
00:57:30,740 --> 00:57:33,870
Woody Bay was a little awkward
out of the stalls and also to gather stride.

801
00:57:33,910 --> 00:57:37,990
Out well towards the right,
Fine 'n' Dandy is racing solo early on.

802
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:41,370
Steventon Star down the center
with Jacob's Pillow.

803
00:57:54,390 --> 00:57:55,430
Hello, Franco.

804
00:57:56,260 --> 00:57:57,640
Simon.

805
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:03,480
-But you're not...
-I'm out.

806
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:06,560
-"Out"?
-Aye. Fucking shut up.

807
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:21,790
Yeah, sorry if I seemed a little shocked
to see you, Frank. It's just...

808
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:25,250
Well, I was gonna...

809
00:58:25,380 --> 00:58:28,170
I was gonna deal with this myself
and then give you the good news, but...

810
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:30,630
You're not gonna believe this.

811
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:33,430
So, two days ago,
I got a call from an old friend of mine.

812
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:35,300
Gav Temperly. You remember him?

813
00:58:35,390 --> 00:58:36,510
Aye.

814
00:58:41,770 --> 00:58:42,810
Anyway.

815
00:58:42,890 --> 00:58:45,440
He's on business in Amsterdam.

816
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:50,730
And he's in a cafe one morning,
and he hears this voice beside him.

817
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:53,950
A whiny, cunty voice.

818
00:58:54,610 --> 00:58:55,610
No.

819
00:58:55,950 --> 00:58:57,700
So he turns around, right?

820
00:58:57,780 --> 00:59:00,740
This is two fucking days ago.
I'm just getting over it myself.

821
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:04,580
-There he is.
-Holy fucking moly.

822
00:59:05,670 --> 00:59:07,250
Hasn't changed in 20 years.

823
00:59:07,290 --> 00:59:10,210
Very same smug, little cunty grin
across his ugly face.

824
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:12,510
-For fuck's sake!
-Aye, Renton.

825
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:14,630
Mark fucking Renton.

826
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:19,680
Living in Amsterdam
all this time on our money.

827
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:21,930
-Cunt. Did Renton clock him?
-No.

828
00:59:21,970 --> 00:59:23,770
So Gav followed him.
He went into an office block

829
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:25,350
not far from the center of town.

830
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:27,650
And Gav had to split then,
but he's gonna go back.

831
00:59:27,690 --> 00:59:30,820
He's gonna hang out,
he's gonna follow Renton home, and then...

832
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:32,860
-And we're gonna pay him a visit.
-Exactly.

833
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:35,030
-I need a passport.
-I can get you one.

834
00:59:35,110 --> 00:59:36,240
I'll take some weapons.

835
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:37,950
Well, we can probably get
weapons there, Franco.

836
00:59:37,990 --> 00:59:40,620
Aye. Probably. They've got
that kind of stuff in Amsterdam, eh?

837
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:44,870
Aye. Now, the important thing
is for you to keep your head down.

838
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:48,920
Low profile till the passport comes through,
till I get the tickets.

839
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:52,550
-'Cause this is an opportunity, Frank.
-Right.

840
00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:54,460
I'm gonna fucking tear him to pieces.

841
00:59:54,510 --> 00:59:56,340
You most definitely fucking will.

842
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:17,530
Simon and I do not sleep together.

843
01:00:17,610 --> 01:00:19,660
No? I had wondered.

844
01:00:20,030 --> 01:00:23,990
Once, but...
I'm his girlfriend, but it's business, really.

845
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:25,660
Simon is not a good person.

846
01:00:25,950 --> 01:00:27,210
But I like him.

847
01:00:27,250 --> 01:00:29,540
More than he likes himself, I think.

848
01:00:29,830 --> 01:00:31,710
Right, but if you're not...

849
01:00:31,790 --> 01:00:34,130
If there's no physical aspect
to your relationship,

850
01:00:34,210 --> 01:00:37,170
I mean, you don't want to be, like...
You know, wasting your time.

851
01:00:37,590 --> 01:00:38,880
What's "choose life"?

852
01:00:41,140 --> 01:00:43,300
-What?
-"Choose life."

853
01:00:45,020 --> 01:00:46,770
Simon says it sometimes.

854
01:00:47,100 --> 01:00:49,770
He says, "Choose life, Veronika."

855
01:00:53,770 --> 01:00:54,900
"Choose life."

856
01:00:55,820 --> 01:00:59,240
"Choose life" was a well-meaning slogan
from a 1980s antidrug campaign.

857
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:02,280
And we used to add things to it.

858
01:01:02,370 --> 01:01:04,240
So I might say, for example, choose...

859
01:01:06,950 --> 01:01:08,410
Designer lingerie

860
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:12,750
in the vain hope of kicking some life
back into a dead relationship.

861
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:14,920
Choose handbags.

862
01:01:15,420 --> 01:01:16,760
Choose high-heeled shoes.

863
01:01:17,050 --> 01:01:20,550
Cashmere and silk
to make yourself feel what passes for happy.

864
01:01:21,470 --> 01:01:24,930
Choose an iPhone made in China
by a woman who jumped out of a window,

865
01:01:24,970 --> 01:01:28,600
and stick it in the pocket of your jacket
fresh from a South Asian firetrap.

866
01:01:29,390 --> 01:01:32,350
Choose Facebook, Twitter,
Snapchat, Instagram

867
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:36,150
and a thousand other ways to spew your bile
across people you've never met.

868
01:01:36,230 --> 01:01:38,070
Choose updating your profile.

869
01:01:38,110 --> 01:01:42,320
Tell the world what you had for breakfast
and hope that someone, somewhere cares.

870
01:01:42,660 --> 01:01:44,620
Choose looking up old flames,

871
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:47,160
desperate to believe that
you don't look as bad as they do.

872
01:01:47,580 --> 01:01:50,870
Choose live-blogging
from your first wank to your last breath.

873
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:53,960
Human interaction reduced
to nothing more than data.

874
01:01:54,130 --> 01:01:57,630
Choose ten things you never knew
about celebrities who'd had surgery.

875
01:01:57,670 --> 01:01:59,340
Choose screaming about abortion.

876
01:01:59,420 --> 01:02:02,510
Choose rape jokes,
slut shaming, revenge porn,

877
01:02:02,590 --> 01:02:04,970
and an endless tide of depressing misogyny.

878
01:02:05,010 --> 01:02:08,680
Choose 9/11 never happened,
and if it did, it was the Jews.

879
01:02:09,140 --> 01:02:12,020
Choose a zero-hour contract
and a two-hour journey to work,

880
01:02:12,100 --> 01:02:14,400
and choose the same
for your kids, only worse.

881
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:18,320
And maybe tell yourself it's better
that they never happened.

882
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:21,070
And then sit back and smother the pain

883
01:02:21,150 --> 01:02:24,990
with an unknown dose of an unknown drug
made in somebody's fucking kitchen.

884
01:02:25,410 --> 01:02:28,830
Choose unfulfilled promise
and wishing you'd done it all differently.

885
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:31,200
Choose never learning
from your own mistakes.

886
01:02:31,450 --> 01:02:33,750
Choose watching history repeat itself.

887
01:02:33,830 --> 01:02:35,920
Choose the slow reconciliation

888
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:40,170
towards what you can get
rather than what you always hoped for.

889
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:42,760
Settle for less and keep a brave face on it.

890
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:44,680
Choose disappointment.

891
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:46,180
And choose losing the ones you loved.

892
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:49,560
And as they fall from view,
a piece of you dies with them.

893
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:53,180
Until you can see that one day in the future,
piece by piece, they will all be gone.

894
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:56,650
And there'll be nothing left
of you to call alive or dead.

895
01:02:56,690 --> 01:02:58,190
Choose your future, Veronika.

896
01:02:58,690 --> 01:03:00,070
Choose life.

897
01:03:11,950 --> 01:03:15,710
Anyway, it amused us at the time.

898
01:03:21,670 --> 01:03:23,010
I like you, Mark.

899
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:53,910
Fuck.

900
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:30,190
What are you gonna do?

901
01:06:31,490 --> 01:06:35,240
I'm going to be the madame
in Simon's bordello.

902
01:06:35,870 --> 01:06:36,950
But really...

903
01:06:38,330 --> 01:06:40,200
What are you gonna do?

904
01:06:40,870 --> 01:06:43,460
I don't know. I should go home.

905
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:45,630
But...

906
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:48,250
To go home with nothing?

907
01:06:48,340 --> 01:06:51,760
No qualification, no career,
not even bringing money.

908
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:53,260
What's at home?

909
01:06:55,590 --> 01:06:57,140
You know.

910
01:06:57,220 --> 01:06:59,310
Emotional attachment.

911
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:01,770
That's all.

912
01:07:05,100 --> 01:07:07,690
-All set?
-Yeah, fine. You're okay?

913
01:07:07,770 --> 01:07:09,610
-Aye.
-Sure?

914
01:07:09,650 --> 01:07:11,650
-Why?
-Nothing.

915
01:07:11,740 --> 01:07:14,610
-Why? What's happened?
-No, nothing's happened. I'm just...

916
01:07:14,700 --> 01:07:16,990
I'm just enjoying us working together.

917
01:07:17,070 --> 01:07:18,450
That's all.

918
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:21,080
Good. So...

919
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:23,460
-Shall we go in? Right.
-Aye.

920
01:07:23,620 --> 01:07:24,790
Jesus.

921
01:07:28,670 --> 01:07:33,130
This is the renovation and conversion
of an iconic Leith building.

922
01:07:33,170 --> 01:07:37,430
We see it very much as being an artisanal
bed-and-breakfast experience.

923
01:07:37,470 --> 01:07:39,260
A destination in its own right.

924
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:42,720
Artworks by local artists on the walls.

925
01:07:42,810 --> 01:07:44,980
Locally sourced fresh food.

926
01:07:45,020 --> 01:07:49,980
Outreach programs to inspire children
in school to think outside the box.

927
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:53,690
To inspire in them a belief that...
Yes, they can.

928
01:07:54,860 --> 01:07:58,740
There was a time when this port
served thousands of ships around the globe.

929
01:07:58,820 --> 01:08:00,240
Now it can rise again.

930
01:08:00,330 --> 01:08:03,330
And we believe our business
will occupy a central role,

931
01:08:03,410 --> 01:08:06,500
both physically and emotionally,

932
01:08:06,540 --> 01:08:09,040
at the heart of this new wave
of regeneration in Leith.

933
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:12,710
Leith 2.1.

934
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:15,380
Exactly.

935
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:20,510
We used to steal all this stuff.

936
01:08:21,510 --> 01:08:22,600
Fancy wallpaper.

937
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:24,520
Sell on to the middle classes and that.

938
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:27,190
Me and Mark used to steal
all kinds of stuff, actually.

939
01:08:27,270 --> 01:08:28,310
Till we got caught.

940
01:08:28,350 --> 01:08:30,860
He got off. I got six months.

941
01:08:30,900 --> 01:08:33,320
Still, you find out what you're good at inside.

942
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:35,150
Signatures... That's what I found out.

943
01:08:35,190 --> 01:08:37,490
Anyone's. If I seen it once, I can do it.

944
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:45,450
So, when I got out, "Bye-bye, shoplifting.
Hello, checkbook. Hello, check card."

945
01:08:45,540 --> 01:08:47,040
Up to Western Union.

946
01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:50,380
Signature, cash in hand.

947
01:08:50,540 --> 01:08:53,920
Up to Swanney's,
pay off my debts, buy some skag.

948
01:08:54,050 --> 01:08:56,380
I was a portable fucking goldmine.

949
01:08:57,550 --> 01:08:58,720
So, what happened?

950
01:09:00,180 --> 01:09:03,220
Chip and PIN, debit cards, e-banking.

951
01:09:03,260 --> 01:09:05,560
Billionaires moving money
at the touch of a button.

952
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:08,020
There's no room
for an honest artisan like me anymore.

953
01:09:09,060 --> 01:09:10,690
So, what did you do?

954
01:09:10,730 --> 01:09:13,480
Back on the pavement. Seven days a week.

955
01:09:15,230 --> 01:09:18,570
I like your stories.
I think you should write them down.

956
01:09:21,030 --> 01:09:22,070
You think?

957
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:25,120
Yeah. Just write them the way you say them.

958
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:28,540
They're funny. I would like to read them.

959
01:09:28,580 --> 01:09:30,710
Mark and Simon can help.

960
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:45,390
"Tommy looks well.

961
01:09:46,140 --> 01:09:47,930
"It's terrifying.

962
01:09:47,970 --> 01:09:49,600
"He's gonna die.

963
01:09:50,770 --> 01:09:54,020
"Sometime between the next few weeks
and the next 15 years,

964
01:09:56,110 --> 01:09:57,650
"Tommy will be no more.

965
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:02,570
"Chances are that I'll be exactly the same.

966
01:10:02,610 --> 01:10:05,280
"Difference is we know this with Tommy.

967
01:10:05,830 --> 01:10:06,830
"Tommy cannot get out.

968
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:11,920
"He cannot afford to heat his home,

969
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:14,130
"put himself in a bubble,

970
01:10:14,170 --> 01:10:16,340
"live in the warm, eat good fresh food,

971
01:10:16,420 --> 01:10:19,300
"keep his mind stimulated
with new challenges.

972
01:10:20,510 --> 01:10:24,470
"He will only live five or 10 or 15 years
before he is crushed.

973
01:10:25,970 --> 01:10:29,220
"Tommy will not survive winter
in West Granton."

974
01:10:46,030 --> 01:10:49,660
Well, I'm trying hard, Mark,
but I'm not feeling anything.

975
01:10:50,450 --> 01:10:53,540
We were young. Bad things happened.
It's over.

976
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:56,290
Can we go home now?

977
01:10:56,580 --> 01:10:59,000
-Two hours to the next train.
-Oh, for fuck's sake.

978
01:10:59,340 --> 01:11:02,010
Look, we're here as an act of memorial.

979
01:11:03,470 --> 01:11:05,050
Nostalgia.

980
01:11:05,140 --> 01:11:07,010
That's why you're here.

981
01:11:07,470 --> 01:11:10,020
You're a tourist in your own youth.

982
01:11:10,060 --> 01:11:13,810
Just 'cause you had a near-death experience,
and now you're feeling all fuzzy and warm.

983
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:17,110
What other moments will you be revisiting?

984
01:11:17,230 --> 01:11:18,360
Here's a good one.

985
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:20,690
How about the time you sold
Tommy his very first hit,

986
01:11:21,070 --> 01:11:23,530
leading him on to heroin addiction,
HIV infection,

987
01:11:23,610 --> 01:11:27,030
and ultimately his death at the age of...
What was it, 22, 23?

988
01:11:27,070 --> 01:11:28,530
-Twenty-three.
-Twenty-three.

989
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:30,950
How innocent was that?

990
01:11:31,410 --> 01:11:33,000
Aye, that's mine.

991
01:11:33,290 --> 01:11:34,710
How's yours?

992
01:11:34,750 --> 01:11:37,130
Don't know what you're talking about.

993
01:11:37,210 --> 01:11:39,210
She'd be a woman by now.

994
01:11:39,290 --> 01:11:40,750
Maybe kids of her own.

995
01:11:41,340 --> 01:11:43,510
But she never got that far, did she?

996
01:11:43,550 --> 01:11:44,760
Never got to lead her life.

997
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:47,010
Because her father,

998
01:11:47,050 --> 01:11:48,890
someone who should have been
looking after her,

999
01:11:48,930 --> 01:11:50,640
protecting his own infant,

1000
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:52,890
was too busy filling
his own veins with heroin

1001
01:11:52,970 --> 01:11:55,100
to check that she was breathing properly.

1002
01:11:57,560 --> 01:11:59,980
How do you keep a lid on that one?

1003
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:49,280
Well, that's that, then.

1004
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:18,370
Here we go.

1005
01:15:05,790 --> 01:15:07,130
Fuck's sake.

1006
01:15:25,770 --> 01:15:28,060
-All right, doll.
-Thanks.

1007
01:15:28,110 --> 01:15:29,610
Looking good, baby.

1008
01:15:29,650 --> 01:15:30,780
Not bad yourself, daddy-o.

1009
01:15:30,820 --> 01:15:32,240
Why, bring it over here.

1010
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:33,570
Really?

1011
01:15:33,610 --> 01:15:35,110
I'm not wearing any knickers.

1012
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:37,780
For fuck's sake.

1013
01:15:38,450 --> 01:15:41,580
Well, tell you what... Just away for a piss.
Back in a moment.

1014
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:42,660
We'll see what's happening, okay?

1015
01:15:42,750 --> 01:15:43,960
-All right, then.
-Aye.

1016
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:45,540
Deal. Done.

1017
01:15:57,680 --> 01:16:00,430
Hi. I can't take your call,
so please leave a message.

1018
01:16:16,570 --> 01:16:17,660
Fuck.

1019
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:21,580
What's all this, then?

1020
01:16:21,660 --> 01:16:23,620
Planning a special event, are we, sir?

1021
01:16:23,660 --> 01:16:25,040
Just give us the tablets, pal.

1022
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:27,000
Remember not to exceed the stated dose.

1023
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:28,210
Just give us the fucking tablets

1024
01:16:28,290 --> 01:16:30,380
before I come through there
and pound your fucking head in.

1025
01:16:30,460 --> 01:16:32,670
Aye, all right. Fucking calm down.

1026
01:16:33,420 --> 01:16:35,420
-Fuck's sake.
-Cunt.

1027
01:16:35,510 --> 01:16:36,680
Prick.

1028
01:17:06,750 --> 01:17:08,080
Cunt!

1029
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:13,380
Fuck. Fuck.

1030
01:19:04,740 --> 01:19:07,030
Rent Boy, where... Mark?

1031
01:19:52,700 --> 01:19:54,750
Go! Go, go, go!

1032
01:19:55,540 --> 01:19:56,620
Fuck!

1033
01:20:06,840 --> 01:20:08,800
Go on, then, you fucking cunt, you!

1034
01:20:09,100 --> 01:20:10,100
Fuck.

1035
01:20:16,730 --> 01:20:18,310
Go! Would you fucking go?

1036
01:20:45,010 --> 01:20:46,300
Fuck it!

1037
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:02,650
Fuck.

1038
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:10,490
I didn't know.

1039
01:21:12,280 --> 01:21:13,620
Okay, okay.

1040
01:21:14,700 --> 01:21:16,870
I might've heard something.
I'm sorry I didn't mention it.

1041
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:18,210
You might've heard something?

1042
01:21:18,290 --> 01:21:20,330
All right, fuck it. I knew.

1043
01:21:20,790 --> 01:21:24,130
I knew, and I could have served you up
to him on a plate any time I wanted to.

1044
01:21:24,210 --> 01:21:26,420
I bet you were fucking
looking forward to it, too, weren't you?

1045
01:21:26,460 --> 01:21:29,590
Yeah, yeah, I was. I was looking forward to it.

1046
01:21:30,470 --> 01:21:31,890
I ought to fucking kill you.

1047
01:21:37,430 --> 01:21:38,890
Fuck is this?

1048
01:21:44,070 --> 01:21:45,150
Get in.

1049
01:21:46,530 --> 01:21:47,990
It's Mark and Simon, right?

1050
01:21:49,450 --> 01:21:50,780
Do you know who I am?

1051
01:21:53,410 --> 01:21:54,530
Good.

1052
01:21:57,410 --> 01:22:00,290
So you know that I own a couple of saunas
in the north of Edinburgh.

1053
01:22:00,330 --> 01:22:04,170
In fact, you boys should know,
I own all the saunas in Edinburgh.

1054
01:22:04,210 --> 01:22:06,420
So your venture
was never gonna happen, was it?

1055
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:08,800
I couldn't have you on my doorstep

1056
01:22:09,380 --> 01:22:13,600
in competition for my members of staff,
for my clientele.

1057
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:15,060
It was never gonna happen, Simon, was it?

1058
01:22:15,140 --> 01:22:17,520
-No, Mr. Doyle.
-Right answer.

1059
01:22:17,560 --> 01:22:20,020
I wouldn't let it happen.
And it's not gonna happen, right?

1060
01:22:21,350 --> 01:22:22,400
Thankfully for you two,

1061
01:22:23,100 --> 01:22:27,820
I've done some due diligence on you,
and what I hear is you're a couple of losers.

1062
01:22:28,690 --> 01:22:30,200
Two absolute losers.

1063
01:22:30,280 --> 01:22:32,910
-How's that sound, Simon?
-Yeah, yeah, that's probably right enough.

1064
01:22:32,990 --> 01:22:35,830
Aye. "Probably right enough." Right answer.

1065
01:22:41,540 --> 01:22:42,830
Take your clothes off.

1066
01:22:44,380 --> 01:22:45,670
All of them.

1067
01:22:53,550 --> 01:22:54,720
Fuck's sake.

1068
01:23:06,940 --> 01:23:08,730
"Probably right enough, Mr. Doyle."

1069
01:23:08,820 --> 01:23:11,780
If you groveled a bit more,
we might not be going home in the buff.

1070
01:23:11,860 --> 01:23:13,070
At least I have my dignity.

1071
01:23:13,150 --> 01:23:15,410
Is that what you're calling it?

1072
01:23:15,450 --> 01:23:16,740
Are you ready?

1073
01:23:16,780 --> 01:23:18,240
-No.
-Come on.

1074
01:23:48,310 --> 01:23:49,400
Hello, boys.

1075
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:51,610
You just delete that right now.

1076
01:23:52,280 --> 01:23:54,030
I put it on Twitter. No one will see.

1077
01:23:54,110 --> 01:23:56,570
Veronika, don't you understand?
There's not gonna be a sauna.

1078
01:23:56,610 --> 01:23:58,580
-Never.
-I know that.

1079
01:23:58,620 --> 01:23:59,870
So we lost everything.

1080
01:23:59,950 --> 01:24:02,790
-Did you not get the e-mail?
-No, I didn't get a fucking e-mail.

1081
01:24:02,870 --> 01:24:04,500
We got the money.

1082
01:24:04,870 --> 01:24:06,420
-What?
-How much?

1083
01:24:06,460 --> 01:24:08,340
The money. What do you call it?

1084
01:24:08,420 --> 01:24:11,050
-Small Business Development?
-How much?

1085
01:24:12,420 --> 01:24:13,470
£100,000.

1086
01:24:14,050 --> 01:24:15,630
No!

1087
01:24:15,680 --> 01:24:16,800
Yeah!

1088
01:24:25,640 --> 01:24:27,730
First,

1089
01:24:27,810 --> 01:24:30,230
there's an opportunity.

1090
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:32,320
And then,

1091
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:33,990
there is a betrayal.

1092
01:24:34,070 --> 01:24:35,820
Mark stole from me.

1093
01:24:36,950 --> 01:24:38,530
His best friend.

1094
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:41,370
So this money is mine.

1095
01:24:41,790 --> 01:24:43,790
First,

1096
01:24:43,830 --> 01:24:46,330
there is an opportunity.

1097
01:24:46,410 --> 01:24:48,170
And then,

1098
01:24:48,250 --> 01:24:49,790
there is a betrayal.

1099
01:24:49,830 --> 01:24:53,130
Simon knew that Francis Begbie was out,
and he chose to keep that a secret.

1100
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:55,590
I owe him nothing.

1101
01:24:56,130 --> 01:24:57,840
We owe him nothing.

1102
01:25:46,310 --> 01:25:48,390
-All right, Murphy?
-Franco.

1103
01:25:50,440 --> 01:25:51,730
Sit down.

1104
01:25:53,480 --> 01:25:54,480
Sit down.

1105
01:25:59,740 --> 01:26:00,910
Now...

1106
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:03,240
So where is he?

1107
01:26:03,580 --> 01:26:05,160
Don't say, "Who?"

1108
01:26:05,240 --> 01:26:06,330
Don't say, "I don't know."

1109
01:26:06,410 --> 01:26:08,410
Just fucking tell me where he is.

1110
01:26:09,330 --> 01:26:11,790
-Still a junkie, Murphy?
-No.

1111
01:26:11,880 --> 01:26:13,080
I'm clean now, Frank.

1112
01:26:13,170 --> 01:26:15,840
You? Clean? Fucking joke.

1113
01:26:16,760 --> 01:26:18,130
What is all this shit anyway?

1114
01:26:18,760 --> 01:26:21,470
It's just, like, stories and that.

1115
01:26:22,010 --> 01:26:23,300
"Stories"?

1116
01:26:24,260 --> 01:26:25,720
What are you writing stories for?

1117
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:27,520
Who's gonna read shit
written by a cunt like you?

1118
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:31,060
Just thought maybe my grandchildren, or...

1119
01:26:31,230 --> 01:26:33,520
-You got grandchildren?
-No.

1120
01:26:33,610 --> 01:26:35,110
What you writing
fucking stories for them for?

1121
01:26:35,150 --> 01:26:37,320
They may not even like stories.
You thought of that?

1122
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:39,240
No. That's a good point, Franco.

1123
01:26:42,820 --> 01:26:46,620
"The sweat was lashing off Sick Boy."

1124
01:26:47,290 --> 01:26:50,750
-Sick... Sick Boy? What, is it about him?
-It's about all of us, like.

1125
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:52,620
-All of you? About me?
-No, not about you.

1126
01:26:52,710 --> 01:26:53,920
Fucking better not be.

1127
01:26:58,710 --> 01:27:00,970
"Strolling Through the Meadows."

1128
01:27:02,300 --> 01:27:03,390
Here, read it.

1129
01:27:03,470 --> 01:27:05,140
-What?
-Read it.

1130
01:27:16,150 --> 01:27:18,230
"Strolling Through the Meadows.

1131
01:27:18,320 --> 01:27:21,490
"The pubs, like, dead busy.

1132
01:27:22,030 --> 01:27:24,570
"It's full o' loco-locals and festival types."

1133
01:27:24,660 --> 01:27:27,280
'Cause the festival was going on,
see, in the story.

1134
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:35,210
"They're all having a little snort
before heading off to the next show.

1135
01:27:35,830 --> 01:27:37,000
"Beg...

1136
01:27:40,010 --> 01:27:41,300
"Beg..."

1137
01:27:43,260 --> 01:27:44,720
I was definitely gonna cut this bit out, Frank.

1138
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:46,090
Well, fucking read it.

1139
01:27:46,680 --> 01:27:52,350
"Begbie's pissed his jeans."

1140
01:27:59,190 --> 01:28:00,400
I remember that night.

1141
01:28:00,820 --> 01:28:01,940
Read on.

1142
01:28:02,030 --> 01:28:03,780
-What?
-Read on. Read on.

1143
01:28:05,990 --> 01:28:09,120
"The boy, likes,
just wouldn't hand over the wallet,

1144
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:11,660
"even when Begbie pulled the knife, like.

1145
01:28:11,700 --> 01:28:13,710
"The last words I heard the dude say was,

1146
01:28:13,790 --> 01:28:15,460
"'You won't use that.'

1147
01:28:15,540 --> 01:28:19,920
"Begbie went fucking crazy, got, like, that
carried away with the bladework, you know.

1148
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:21,300
"We nearly forgot the wallet, likes.

1149
01:28:21,380 --> 01:28:25,340
"Blood was flowing into the latrine,
mixing with the piss."

1150
01:28:25,380 --> 01:28:26,430
Blood.

1151
01:28:26,510 --> 01:28:28,180
Mixing with the piss.

1152
01:28:28,220 --> 01:28:29,680
It was an ugly sight, man.

1153
01:28:29,720 --> 01:28:30,930
Murphy.

1154
01:28:31,560 --> 01:28:33,850
You've got hidden talents, man.

1155
01:28:34,980 --> 01:28:36,730
"Then it happens.

1156
01:28:37,650 --> 01:28:41,360
"All I did was put a pint
of Export in front of Begbie.

1157
01:28:41,400 --> 01:28:43,530
"He takes one fucking gulp out o' it.

1158
01:28:43,570 --> 01:28:46,070
"Then he throws the empty glass
from his last pint

01:28:46,110 --> 01:28:50,160
"straight over the balcony

"Begbie's on his feet and we're racing
down the stairs, and he shouts..."

1163
01:28:58,460 --> 01:29:00,040
"That lady got glassed!

1164
01:29:00,090 --> 01:29:03,210
"And no cunt leaves here
till I find out what cunt did it."

1165
01:29:03,710 --> 01:29:06,510
"That lady got glassed.

"And no cunt leaves here
till I find out what cunt did it."

1167
01:29:13,100 --> 01:29:14,600
That is lovely.

1168
01:29:14,770 --> 01:29:16,430
What else have you got?

1169
01:29:16,480 --> 01:29:17,600
What's this? What's this?

1170
01:29:17,690 --> 01:29:19,480
London, London.

1171
01:29:19,560 --> 01:29:23,440
"Renton had never seen so much money.

1172
01:29:23,530 --> 01:29:28,030
"He stole the money.
Took it from his friends."

1173
01:29:28,110 --> 01:29:30,370
What? No, that is just a story, that one.

1174
01:29:30,450 --> 01:29:32,080
That is just a little story.

1175
01:29:32,120 --> 01:29:36,330
"Renton felt no sympathy for Begbie.

1176
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:38,710
"No.

1177
01:29:38,790 --> 01:29:42,340
"Renton's real guilt was for Spud.

01:29:42,790 --> 01:29:44,250
"He loved Spud.

"If there was one person
whom Renton would try to compensate,

1181
01:29:52,140 --> 01:29:53,180
"it was Spud."

1182
01:29:53,810 --> 01:29:55,470
"Compensate"?

1183
01:30:01,860 --> 01:30:04,320
I'm only gonna fucking ask you this once.

1184
01:30:04,900 --> 01:30:06,150
How much money did he leave you?

1185
01:30:06,820 --> 01:30:08,530
£4,000. Left it in a locker.

1186
01:30:11,700 --> 01:30:14,160
Well, you didn't fucking
tell us that at the time.

1187
01:30:14,740 --> 01:30:16,160
I'm sorry, Franco.

1188
01:30:19,330 --> 01:30:21,370
Don't fucking move.

1189
01:30:32,680 --> 01:30:36,010
I did steal the money,
but they shouldn't have been surprised.

1190
01:30:36,060 --> 01:30:38,600
I mean, we stole from all sorts of people.

1191
01:30:38,680 --> 01:30:42,480
Shops, businesses, neighbors, family.

1192
01:30:43,310 --> 01:30:46,070
Friends was just one more class of victim.

1193
01:30:50,700 --> 01:30:53,780
In the morning,
when you were gone with my money,

1194
01:30:53,870 --> 01:30:56,080
I was furious, but also I thought,

1195
01:30:57,540 --> 01:30:59,160
"'Course he's taken it.

1196
01:31:00,540 --> 01:31:02,210
"Why wouldn't he?"

1197
01:31:40,330 --> 01:31:41,540
Daniel?

1198
01:31:42,710 --> 01:31:43,830
It's me.

1199
01:31:44,750 --> 01:31:46,170
I'm not here.

1200
01:31:47,960 --> 01:31:50,210
-What do you mean, you're not here?
-Go!

1201
01:31:50,260 --> 01:31:52,090
Veronika, you cannot be here. Please.

1202
01:31:52,510 --> 01:31:54,380
It's not safe for you, kitten-cat.

1203
01:31:54,430 --> 01:31:56,850
-You got to vamoose.
-What happened?

1204
01:31:56,930 --> 01:31:58,180
Tell Mark. Tell Simon.

1205
01:31:58,260 --> 01:32:00,220
They need to run quick.
The Beggar is on the loose.

1206
01:32:00,270 --> 01:32:02,100
Please, Veronika, he'll be back at any minute.

1207
01:32:02,180 --> 01:32:03,520
Who will be back?

1208
01:32:08,770 --> 01:32:10,150
Well, well, well.

1209
01:32:11,780 --> 01:32:12,900
Rescue.

1210
01:32:14,610 --> 01:32:15,700
This your bird, Murphy?

1211
01:32:15,780 --> 01:32:18,030
Please, Franco, leave her alone.
She has nothing to do with this.

1212
01:32:18,490 --> 01:32:20,200
'Course she hasn't.

1213
01:32:20,870 --> 01:32:24,160
What would she be doing
with an ugly cunt like you?

1214
01:32:28,340 --> 01:32:30,250
What's your name, doll?

1215
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:31,960
Veronika.

1216
01:32:35,050 --> 01:32:36,380
Veronika.

1217
01:32:37,140 --> 01:32:38,890
Well, that's lovely.

1218
01:32:40,220 --> 01:32:43,310
And how do you know Mr. Murphy here?

1219
01:32:46,520 --> 01:32:49,310
-Simon.
-Simon?

1220
01:32:50,730 --> 01:32:52,280
Good old Simon.

1221
01:32:54,320 --> 01:32:58,160
And what about Simon's very best friend?

1222
01:33:00,530 --> 01:33:01,700
You know him and all?

1223
01:33:11,880 --> 01:33:13,510
You got a phone?

1224
01:33:15,260 --> 01:33:17,380
-A phone?
-Aye. A mobile phone.

1225
01:33:17,470 --> 01:33:19,510
You know the kind of thing.

1226
01:33:21,680 --> 01:33:23,310
-Yes.
-Give it.

1227
01:33:27,560 --> 01:33:29,350
But you have to let us go.

1228
01:33:29,440 --> 01:33:30,480
Both of us.

1229
01:33:46,910 --> 01:33:49,460
-Another?
-No, I'm fine.

1230
01:33:54,380 --> 01:33:55,630
Where are you going?

1231
01:33:56,210 --> 01:33:58,300
You shouldn't be out
in this neck of the woods, kitten-cat.

1232
01:33:58,380 --> 01:34:00,430
I have a plan for us.

1233
01:34:00,510 --> 01:34:01,720
What?

1234
01:34:41,180 --> 01:34:45,140
"We went for a piss
in the old Leith Central Station.

1235
01:34:45,220 --> 01:34:48,270
"Me, Renton and Begbie.

1236
01:34:48,310 --> 01:34:51,520
"Place was empty, soon to be demolished."

1237
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:54,270
Some size o' station this was.

1238
01:34:54,360 --> 01:34:56,270
Used to be steam engines
to all over from here.

1239
01:34:56,320 --> 01:34:57,980
Choo-fucking-choo!

1240
01:34:58,690 --> 01:35:01,990
"An old drunkard,
whom Begbie had been looking at,

1241
01:35:02,910 --> 01:35:05,830
"lurched up to us, wine bottle in his hand."

1242
01:35:08,950 --> 01:35:10,620
What're you up to, lads, eh?

1243
01:35:11,750 --> 01:35:12,960
Trainspotting?

1244
01:35:13,880 --> 01:35:15,170
In Leith Central?

1245
01:35:15,250 --> 01:35:16,960
"He says, laughing.

1246
01:35:18,380 --> 01:35:23,760
"I noticed Begbie seemed
strangely subdued and uncomfortable."

1247
01:35:25,350 --> 01:35:26,720
They fucking turn it on for you.

1248
01:35:26,810 --> 01:35:27,930
Fucking shitbag!

1249
01:35:28,310 --> 01:35:31,140
"It was only then I realized

1250
01:35:31,230 --> 01:35:34,020
"the old wino was Begbie's father."

1251
01:35:39,110 --> 01:35:41,240
"First, there is an opportunity.

1252
01:35:41,320 --> 01:35:44,030
"And then, there's a betrayal."

1253
01:35:44,700 --> 01:35:46,370
And that's how it ends.

1254
01:35:48,330 --> 01:35:49,490
That's funny.

1255
01:35:49,540 --> 01:35:52,540
That's like everything
I've been writing about.

1256
01:35:53,120 --> 01:35:54,330
Yes, Daniel.

1257
01:35:54,830 --> 01:35:56,420
But this one...

1258
01:35:57,090 --> 01:35:58,670
Needs an ending too.

1259
01:36:04,550 --> 01:36:05,890
June.

1260
01:36:06,890 --> 01:36:08,390
Franco Junior.

1261
01:36:08,850 --> 01:36:10,720
Can I come in for a moment?

1262
01:36:14,190 --> 01:36:18,190
There's something I have to do tonight,
and then I'm going away.

1263
01:36:19,360 --> 01:36:23,360
One way or another, it'll be a long time
before you see me again.

1264
01:36:25,530 --> 01:36:28,030
So I just thought I'd come by.

1265
01:36:29,740 --> 01:36:32,950
I just thought I'd come by
and say good luck, son.

1266
01:36:33,790 --> 01:36:35,290
That's all.

1267
01:36:37,710 --> 01:36:38,750
Thanks, Dad.

1268
01:36:38,840 --> 01:36:40,880
See, it's difficult for me, 'cause...

1269
01:36:40,920 --> 01:36:43,380
We never had any of that when I was a boy.

1270
01:36:44,340 --> 01:36:47,140
Not, like, hotel...

1271
01:36:48,010 --> 01:36:49,140
Management.

1272
01:36:49,220 --> 01:36:50,890
Aye, hotel fucking management,
all that shit.

1273
01:36:50,930 --> 01:36:52,770
I never had any of that.

1274
01:36:55,140 --> 01:36:56,770
Still...

1275
01:36:57,940 --> 01:37:00,190
World changes, eh, June?

1276
01:37:01,320 --> 01:37:03,070
Even if we don't.

1277
01:37:05,200 --> 01:37:07,740
So... Look after yourself, son.

1278
01:37:12,330 --> 01:37:14,450
The old wino was my father.

1279
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:17,670
This fool is yours.

1280
01:37:22,920 --> 01:37:25,340
You'll be a better man than either of us.

1281
01:38:04,960 --> 01:38:06,420
What the fuck?

1282
01:38:06,460 --> 01:38:07,800
She's not here.

1283
01:38:08,300 --> 01:38:09,760
And seeing as we both are,

1284
01:38:09,800 --> 01:38:11,930
don't imagine she'll turn up any time soon.

1285
01:38:11,970 --> 01:38:13,810
I'm gonna call her.

1286
01:38:14,560 --> 01:38:16,220
It's switched off.

1287
01:38:17,890 --> 01:38:19,310
So, what are we doing here, then?

1288
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:22,900
It's her way of saying goodbye, I suppose.

1289
01:38:32,820 --> 01:38:34,160
I loved that woman.

1290
01:38:34,990 --> 01:38:38,830
Mark! I'm so sorry! I've done a terrible thing!

1291
01:38:38,910 --> 01:38:40,290
-Fuck are you doing here?
-Lock the doors!

1292
01:38:40,330 --> 01:38:42,210
Sorry about what?

1293
01:38:42,540 --> 01:38:43,840
Lock it!

1294
01:38:43,920 --> 01:38:46,090
-Sorry for what?
-Get upstairs now!

1295
01:38:48,010 --> 01:38:50,340
We have to get to fuck now!

1296
01:38:50,510 --> 01:38:53,640
-Mark! I've done a terrible thing!
-What?

1297
01:38:53,680 --> 01:38:54,850
-Franco!
-What?

1298
01:38:54,890 --> 01:38:56,680
Veronika! Gail!

1299
01:38:57,020 --> 01:38:58,680
Little Fergus. Well, he's not so little anymore.

1300
01:38:58,730 --> 01:39:00,850
You seen him recently? He's really shot up...

1301
01:39:00,890 --> 01:39:02,770
What the fuck are you talking about, Murphy?

1302
01:39:02,850 --> 01:39:04,360
Aye, carry on, Spud.

1303
01:39:04,860 --> 01:39:06,690
Finish your story.

1304
01:39:07,110 --> 01:39:08,530
'Cause we're all dying to hear it.

1305
01:39:19,370 --> 01:39:22,040
Well, it's like the lady says.

1306
01:39:23,380 --> 01:39:24,710
Betrayal.

1307
01:39:27,380 --> 01:39:28,800
No.

1308
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:32,970
No, first, there is an opportunity, right?

1309
01:39:33,050 --> 01:39:37,010
And then... Then there is a betrayal.

1310
01:39:37,060 --> 01:39:38,850
We've all heard that one before, eh, Mark?

1311
01:39:38,890 --> 01:39:41,350
-Aye, maybe.
-Aye, fucking maybe.

1312
01:39:41,390 --> 01:39:45,610
Aye, well, like you said,
20 years has just flown by, eh?

1313
01:39:45,690 --> 01:39:46,900
And here we all are.

1314
01:39:46,940 --> 01:39:48,400
Boys got lucky again.

1315
01:39:49,190 --> 01:39:51,070
Bit of money again.

1316
01:39:51,150 --> 01:39:53,240
With a... With a...

1317
01:39:53,280 --> 01:39:55,160
with a fucking whore from Bulgaria.

1318
01:39:58,620 --> 01:40:00,080
So...

1319
01:40:03,080 --> 01:40:04,420
How does it end?

1320
01:40:05,330 --> 01:40:08,090
-In a box, Franco.
-That's right.

1321
01:40:08,420 --> 01:40:10,210
We're all in a box.

1322
01:40:11,340 --> 01:40:12,970
Just waiting for the lid to come down.

1323
01:40:13,050 --> 01:40:15,760
-Frank, come on.
-You knew.

1324
01:40:16,090 --> 01:40:18,260
Stringing me along, so you were.

1325
01:40:18,350 --> 01:40:20,350
Honestly, mate...

1326
01:40:22,770 --> 01:40:24,270
Fucking deal with you later.

1327
01:40:25,270 --> 01:40:26,730
Now...

1328
01:40:27,440 --> 01:40:28,520
Rent Boy.

1329
01:40:29,770 --> 01:40:31,110
You and me.

1330
01:41:32,750 --> 01:41:34,340
You know, I killed a man once.

1331
01:41:36,510 --> 01:41:39,340
A man who'd done nothing to me.

1332
01:41:39,470 --> 01:41:42,850
Cunt just looked at me the wrong way

1333
01:41:42,890 --> 01:41:45,600
in a moment when I was thinking of you.

1334
01:41:47,850 --> 01:41:50,650
I've been thinking about you for 20 year.

1335
01:41:51,610 --> 01:41:53,440
When you robbed us.

1336
01:41:54,150 --> 01:41:55,740
Your best mates.

1337
01:41:57,860 --> 01:41:59,860
Never got my money back.

1338
01:42:01,030 --> 01:42:03,030
Never got my hope back.

1339
01:42:03,870 --> 01:42:06,660
I always promised myself that one day...

1340
01:42:08,120 --> 01:42:09,370
Come on, Rent Boy.

1341
01:42:09,460 --> 01:42:11,710
Not like you to be so shy.

1342
01:42:17,300 --> 01:42:19,880
I remember

1343
01:42:21,300 --> 01:42:24,140
my first day at primary school.

1344
01:42:26,390 --> 01:42:27,730
My very first day.

1345
01:42:28,270 --> 01:42:30,690
And the teacher, she said,

1346
01:42:30,730 --> 01:42:36,230
"Good morning, Mark.
You can sit here, next to Francis."

1347
01:42:38,820 --> 01:42:40,240
Remember that, Franco?

1348
01:42:40,990 --> 01:42:43,910
You were older. You'd been kept back.

1349
01:42:43,990 --> 01:42:45,450
I remember that well enough.

1350
01:42:45,910 --> 01:42:47,410
Aye.

1351
01:42:49,290 --> 01:42:51,370
Had it all before us, didn't we?

1352
01:42:52,960 --> 01:42:54,420
Had it all still to come.

1353
01:42:57,260 --> 01:42:59,050
And now here we are.

1354
01:42:59,090 --> 01:43:01,760
Aye. You've done all right.

1355
01:43:01,840 --> 01:43:05,140
World's all right for smart cunts,
but what about me?

1356
01:43:06,010 --> 01:43:09,310
What about fucking men like me?
What do I get?

1357
01:43:09,390 --> 01:43:11,270
All I can take with my bare hands.

1358
01:43:11,350 --> 01:43:12,850
All I can get with my fists.

1359
01:43:16,190 --> 01:43:17,940
Is that what I fucking get?

1360
01:43:23,410 --> 01:43:25,580
Who's the fucking smart cunt now?

1361
01:43:44,720 --> 01:43:46,050
Fuck.

1362
01:43:47,640 --> 01:43:49,310
Aye. Here we fucking are.

1363
01:44:25,180 --> 01:44:26,510
Come on.

1364
01:44:27,760 --> 01:44:28,930
Come on, Mark.

1365
01:44:31,350 --> 01:44:32,730
Come on.

1366
01:45:02,210 --> 01:45:03,720
Here. Come on.

1367
01:45:09,050 --> 01:45:10,140
Franco!

1368
01:46:09,200 --> 01:46:10,990
"So she puts it to Spud..."

1369
01:46:11,070 --> 01:46:13,620
It will be safe if you leave with me.

1370
01:46:14,450 --> 01:46:17,910
No, I'm like one of the last
indigenous guys around here.

1371
01:46:18,790 --> 01:46:20,210
I cannot go anywhere.

1372
01:46:20,290 --> 01:46:21,670
"He says, clinging to the hope

1373
01:46:21,750 --> 01:46:24,460
"that he won't commit
this crime against his friends.

1374
01:46:25,170 --> 01:46:26,300
"And she says..."

1375
01:46:26,380 --> 01:46:28,170
I'll send you your share.

1376
01:46:28,260 --> 01:46:32,300
That doesn't work for me, Veronika.
I'll just blow it all on smack.

1377
01:46:33,560 --> 01:46:35,310
All right.

1378
01:46:35,390 --> 01:46:37,390
I'll send it to Gail, then.

1379
01:46:39,810 --> 01:46:41,350
And little Fergus.

1380
01:46:41,440 --> 01:46:44,770
"Gail, little Fergus.

1381
01:46:44,820 --> 01:46:47,400
"A chance to see them smile again.

1382
01:46:51,660 --> 01:46:53,620
"He takes the pen.

1383
01:46:53,660 --> 01:46:56,120
"And with his gift of forgery,
so lately underused,

1384
01:46:56,160 --> 01:46:57,790
"he signs their names.

1385
01:46:57,830 --> 01:47:01,420
"Simon Williamson. Mark Renton.

1386
01:47:01,960 --> 01:47:05,420
"He transfers the full £100,000

1387
01:47:05,500 --> 01:47:08,840
"to the bank account of
Veronika Kovach in Bulgaria."

1388
01:47:09,380 --> 01:47:10,760
Thank you, Daniel.

1389
01:47:10,840 --> 01:47:13,760
Spud. Most folks call me Spud.

1390
01:48:51,190 --> 01:48:52,240
Fuck.

1391
01:48:53,280 --> 01:48:55,320
He's doing what?

1392
01:48:55,410 --> 01:48:57,700
-Writing them down.
-Really?
