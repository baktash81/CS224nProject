- Yeah.

8
00:03:35,954 --> 00:03:38,149
I told him, "Hector,

12

13
00:03:48,633 --> 00:03:50,066

only 67 years old,

16
00:03:56,574 --> 00:04:00,203
already his eyes are
turning into headlights.

17
00:04:00,278 --> 00:04:02,678
It got to where...

18
00:04:03,848 --> 00:04:07,909
I practically had
to drag him to bed.

19
00:04:09,353 --> 00:04:12,288
Well, that's

28
00:04:36,347 --> 00:04:38,281
Say, that looks delicious.

29
00:04:38,349 --> 00:04:41,785
Why don't you
squeeze a little shot

30
00:04:41,853 --> 00:04:45,289

a little zing to it.

I can't do that.
She's my mother.

37

It was nothing more than
a misunderstanding.

Mm-hmm.

of this hotel.

Yes, Griffith.

Mr. Peache,
things are going badly.

58
00:06:03,034 --> 00:06:05,969
The fourth floor is a disaster.

59
00:06:06,037 --> 00:06:06,833
Mrs. Dunphy...

60
00:06:06,904 --> 00:06:10,465
alleges that her husband was
propositioned by an elderly lady.

61
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:13,408
And we know who that was.

62
00:06:13,477 --> 00:06:15,968
Senator Byrum has had
his suite double-booked.

63
00:06:16,047 --> 00:06:19,483
Okay, I'll take care of
Mrs. Dunphy and the senator,

64
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:22,485
and you take care
of the fourth floor.

65
00:06:24,055 --> 00:06:27,491
You, young man,
still have to eat.

66
00:06:27,558 --> 00:06:29,992
I'll try and join you.
Okay?

You wouldn't be Mrs. Dunphy?

70

For crying out loud, you were
described so differently.

and I'm not saying he didn't.

But you're better off
paying him protection money.

00:26:45,642 --> 00:26:49,169
- You're 15?
- Yep.

357
00:26:49,245 --> 00:26:52,180
I should know that, shouldn't I?

358
00:26:52,248 --> 00:26:55,615
It's this damn job,
24 hours a day. I'm sorry.

359
00:26:58,722 --> 00:27:02,818
- I heard you got in trouble today.
- Yeah.

360
00:27:02,892 --> 00:27:05,053
Aw, quit worrying.

361
00:27:05,128 --> 00:27:08,461
Your dad called up
and raised hell about those boys.

362
00:27:08,531 --> 00:27:13,025
You called the school? Great.
Now I'll really get slaughtered.

363
00:27:13,103 --> 00:27:14,972
Clifford,

364
00:27:15,105 --> 00:27:17,539
you're not going
to get slaughtered.

365
00:27:17,607 --> 00:27:20,542
They already think I'm a fruit.

366
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:22,976
The principal's going
to talk to those boys...

367
00:27:23,046 --> 00:27:24,911
and straighten this whole thing out.

368
00:27:24,982 --> 00:27:27,416
And if they try anything,

369
00:27:27,484 --> 00:27:30,419
you go right for the eyes.

370
00:27:30,487 --> 00:27:33,422
Hit them hard as you can.

371
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:37,119
Blind them!
Takes the fight out of them.

372
00:27:37,194 --> 00:27:41,824
I don't think blinding fists
is the answer to this problem.

373
00:27:41,898 --> 00:27:47,359
Well then, kick 'em in the cojones!
That's the thing.

374
00:27:51,908 --> 00:27:54,206
No! No!

375
00:27:54,277 --> 00:27:57,735
- I'm older. I need this more.
- [Chuckles]

376
00:27:57,814 --> 00:27:59,509
How would you know that?

377
00:27:59,583 --> 00:28:03,178
- He can't take a joke.
- I don't see the humor in extortion...

378
00:28:03,253 --> 00:28:07,349
- Real or pretended!
- [Mutters]

379
00:28:07,424 --> 00:28:09,858
Well, maybe, I guess...

380
00:28:09,926 --> 00:28:14,295
- it could have backfired a little bit.
- It backfired on you.

381
00:28:14,364 --> 00:28:17,458
I ought to suspend you,

382
00:28:17,534 --> 00:28:20,503
but since school just started
and since no harm was done,

383
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:23,300
I'm going to be a very nice guy
and let you off...

384
00:28:23,373 --> 00:28:26,206
- Thanks.
...with a week's detention.

385
00:28:26,276 --> 00:28:30,508
All right? Take a walk.

386
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:32,480

387
00:28:33,683 --> 00:28:35,708
Clifford,

388
00:28:35,786 --> 00:28:39,620
things are less sheltered here
than at Southside,

389
00:28:39,689 --> 00:28:41,748
but don't let that throw you.

390
00:28:41,825 --> 00:28:45,226
They're also less narrow.

391
00:28:45,295 --> 00:28:48,423
Don't cry wolf every time somebody
looks at you cross-eyed.

392
00:28:48,498 --> 00:28:51,399
All right, son?
Come on. Get out of here.

You give me trouble.
People don't do that around here.

395
00:29:22,365 --> 00:29:26,699
So you better grow some eyes
in back of your head,

396
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:30,934

to know when it's coming.

Romeo and Juliet...

398
00:29:38,248 --> 00:29:42,241
Romeo and Juliet
were a couple of kids...

399
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:45,686
that had the hots for each other,

400
00:29:45,755 --> 00:29:47,188
and they couldn't
do anything about it...

401
00:29:47,257 --> 00:29:49,157
because they lived in a society...

402
00:29:49,226 --> 00:29:51,717
where they had to be married
to do anything about it.

403
00:29:51,795 --> 00:29:53,126
They still do.

404
00:29:53,196 --> 00:29:57,223
Romeo and Juliet
is a play about love and sex...

405
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:59,393
and people willing
to die for it.

406
00:29:59,469 --> 00:30:02,199

as long as they're blonde.

It's... it's important.

I hope you don't
get mad or anything,

to make some money?

You see, there are these guys.

Maybe you noticed
them in the bathroom.

00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:11,397
- They're making me pay protection.
- From what?

460
00:36:11,474 --> 00:36:15,638
From themselves, but
that's not what they say.

461
00:36:15,711 --> 00:36:20,205
They say they're protecting me

...well, mainly you.
- From me?

Yeah. I know that's not true.

At least, I think it's not.

What idea?

467
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:37,424
To pay you to be
my bodyguard.

468
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:40,867
Maybe some other kids could, too.

Also, I could do your homework.
I'm pretty smart.

it's not paying extortion.

00:57:43,063 --> 00:57:45,497
They don't make them anymore.

710
00:57:45,566 --> 00:57:48,160
I've been putting this together
for a year now,

711
00:57:48,235 --> 00:57:49,702
and I'm down to one lousy cylinder.

712
00:57:49,770 --> 00:57:51,465
You built this?

713
00:57:51,539 --> 00:57:53,769
Rebuilt it.

714
00:57:53,841 --> 00:57:55,274
Almost.

715
00:58:17,597 --> 00:58:18,655
Oh, hey, how you doing?

716
00:58:18,732 --> 00:58:22,828
I'm looking for a 350 cylinder.

717
00:58:22,903 --> 00:58:24,097
- You got one?
- No, I don't.

718
00:58:24,171 --> 00:58:27,334
- You sure?
- Nope. Sorry.

719
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:39,885
[Linderman]
How about your mom?

720
00:58:39,953 --> 00:58:44,219
[Clifford]
She died in a car accident.

721
00:58:44,291 --> 00:58:47,385
- That's too bad.
- My grandmother moved in with us.

722
00:58:47,461 --> 00:58:48,894
She's like no one
I've ever seen before.

723
00:58:48,962 --> 00:58:53,399
She's really old,
but she acts like a kid.

724
00:58:53,467 --> 00:58:55,401
She gets...

725
00:58:55,469 --> 00:58:56,902
a little drunk.

726
00:58:56,970 --> 00:58:58,403
Picks up guys.

727
00:58:58,472 --> 00:59:01,407
- You're kidding.
- No.

728
00:59:01,475 --> 00:59:04,410
- Sounds great.
- She is, really.

729
00:59:04,478 --> 00:59:09,916
We gotta keep an eye on her
'cause she gets into things.

730
00:59:11,485 --> 00:59:15,421
Maybe she's afraid
of being old and dying.

731
00:59:15,489 --> 00:59:19,926
No, I think she's afraid
of not being alive.

732
00:59:27,934 --> 00:59:30,368
My dad had one of those.

733
00:59:30,437 --> 00:59:32,871
It looked like that then.

734
00:59:32,939 --> 00:59:36,375
- What does he do?
- Watches TV.

735
00:59:45,786 --> 00:59:47,219
How's this?

736
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:55,393
Almost.

737
01:00:18,318 --> 01:00:20,411
He was only nine.

738
01:00:20,487 --> 01:00:24,423
I practically raised him
since he was two.

739
01:00:25,992 --> 01:00:27,926
He'd drive you crazy.

740
01:00:27,994 --> 01:00:30,428
Tell him to sit down,

741
01:00:30,497 --> 01:00:31,930
he'd stand up.

742
01:00:31,998 --> 01:00:34,933
Tell him to do his homework,

743
01:00:35,001 --> 01:00:37,435
he'd read a comic book.

744
01:00:43,343 --> 01:00:46,244
Couldn't eat food
without spitting it at you.

745
01:00:48,081 --> 01:00:50,015
A real shoplifter, too.

746
01:00:50,083 --> 01:00:52,017
Go through a store,

747
01:00:52,085 --> 01:00:56,522
half of it would wind up
in his pocket.

748
01:00:56,590 --> 01:00:59,252
He was a good kid.

749
01:00:59,326 --> 01:01:01,260
A real handful, though.

750
01:01:06,266 --> 01:01:08,200
Poor little guy.

751
01:01:09,936 --> 01:01:11,369
Poor little guy.

752
01:01:46,239 --> 01:01:48,230
[No Audible Dialogue]

753
01:03:05,385 --> 01:03:07,478
That's her, Mr. Dobbs.

754
01:03:11,091 --> 01:03:12,820
I got to go.

755
01:03:14,894 --> 01:03:18,921
Hello, Mrs. Peache.
I'd like you to meet Mr. Dobbs,

756
01:03:18,999 --> 01:03:20,933
chief of hotel operations.

757
01:03:21,001 --> 01:03:24,368
- How do you do?
- Hiya, good-looking!

758
01:03:24,437 --> 01:03:27,873
Griffith has been telling me
a great deal about you.

759
01:03:27,941 --> 01:03:30,876
Has he?
Well, um...

760
01:03:30,944 --> 01:03:34,380
Uh, sit down.
Have a little drink.

761
01:03:34,447 --> 01:03:36,381
They don't charge me.

762
01:03:36,449 --> 01:03:38,883
You know what I mean?

763
01:03:47,961 --> 01:03:50,395
This is really the life.

764
01:03:50,463 --> 01:03:52,397
You know, it's interesting.

765
01:03:52,465 --> 01:03:56,401
I must have met
about a million people.

766
01:03:56,469 --> 01:03:58,699
Not many kids.
Mostly adults.

767
01:03:58,772 --> 01:04:01,741
Anytime you want to trade,
it's okay with me.

768
01:04:01,808 --> 01:04:05,710
Some view.
Is this good for stargazing?

769
01:04:05,779 --> 01:04:07,337
Uh...

770
01:04:09,382 --> 01:04:10,815
stars...

771
01:04:10,884 --> 01:04:12,818
the, uh, moon...

772
01:04:12,886 --> 01:04:14,615
and, uh...

773
01:04:14,687 --> 01:04:16,154
other heavenly bodies.

774
01:04:20,493 --> 01:04:21,926
All right.

775
01:04:21,995 --> 01:04:24,327
What time is it?

776
01:04:24,397 --> 01:04:25,864
About 7:00.

777
01:04:25,932 --> 01:04:28,366
That's Linda over there.

778
01:04:32,439 --> 01:04:36,876
I trust your stay here
was a pleasant one.

779
01:04:36,943 --> 01:04:38,877
Very pleasant.

780
01:04:38,945 --> 01:04:41,880
And the room was all right?

781
01:04:41,948 --> 01:04:43,643
Perfect.

782
01:04:43,716 --> 01:04:46,378
And the service was...

783
01:04:46,453 --> 01:04:48,148
adequate?

784
01:04:48,221 --> 01:04:50,519
More than adequate.

785
01:04:53,860 --> 01:04:55,293
Thank you.

786
01:04:55,361 --> 01:04:56,828
You're welcome.

787
01:04:56,896 --> 01:04:59,228
When will you visit next?

788
01:04:59,299 --> 01:05:01,028
Friday.

789
01:05:02,702 --> 01:05:04,636
Well, I think we can
accommodate you.

790
01:05:04,704 --> 01:05:06,934
I certainly hope so.

791
01:05:07,006 --> 01:05:08,530
Dad...

792
01:05:08,608 --> 01:05:11,270
So have a very safe flight.

793
01:05:11,344 --> 01:05:13,209
And your key?

794
01:05:13,279 --> 01:05:15,304
You have it, Peachy.

795
01:05:15,381 --> 01:05:16,814
Of course.

796
01:05:16,883 --> 01:05:19,443
We're talking a two-day job
on the air conditioning.

797
01:05:19,519 --> 01:05:22,147
If it gets hotter in here we're going
to have some miserable customers.

798
01:05:22,222 --> 01:05:26,090
Well, what if we work
through the night?

799
01:05:26,159 --> 01:05:28,627
- Night?
- So we'll just have one day without it.

800
01:05:28,695 --> 01:05:31,596
- Night?
- Night. I'd appreciate it.

801
01:05:31,664 --> 01:05:35,964
- [Phone Ringing]
- Peache here. Thank you.

802
01:05:36,035 --> 01:05:37,468
Peache here.

803
01:05:37,537 --> 01:05:38,970
My mother?

804
01:05:39,038 --> 01:05:40,801
Oh, no.

805
01:05:40,874 --> 01:05:42,307
Where?

806
01:05:42,375 --> 01:05:44,468
How serious is it?

807
01:05:52,919 --> 01:05:54,352
Mother?

808
01:05:54,420 --> 01:05:55,853
Are you...

809
01:05:55,922 --> 01:05:57,856
Just don't get excited.

810
01:05:57,924 --> 01:05:59,357
He's all right.

811
01:05:59,425 --> 01:06:01,484
Didn't know his limitations.

812
01:06:01,561 --> 01:06:05,497
I warned him, but he kept saying
he was an animal.

813
01:06:07,567 --> 01:06:09,000
Give me this.

814
01:06:09,068 --> 01:06:11,604
Do you know who this is?

815
01:06:11,604 --> 01:06:12,502
Do you know who this is?

816
01:06:13,872 --> 01:06:17,808
Your goose is really
cooked this time, Peache.

817
01:06:17,876 --> 01:06:19,810
She's finally done it.

818
01:06:19,878 --> 01:06:21,311
Griffith...

819
01:06:21,380 --> 01:06:24,110
will you stop
hovering over me?

820
01:06:24,183 --> 01:06:26,117
Get away from me.

821
01:06:26,185 --> 01:06:29,120
I'm just getting
my second wind.

822
01:06:29,188 --> 01:06:32,624
You can really dance, sweetheart.

823
01:06:32,691 --> 01:06:35,125
You're not so bad yourself, Dobbsy,

824
01:06:35,194 --> 01:06:38,129
just a little out of shape.

825
01:06:38,197 --> 01:06:44,136
I haven't danced or had
a good time for ever so long.

826
01:06:44,203 --> 01:06:46,569
- Sir...
- Get away!

827
01:06:46,639 --> 01:06:48,573
Can I see you for a second?

828
01:06:48,641 --> 01:06:51,337
Griffith, sit down.

829
01:06:54,046 --> 01:06:56,640
They're getting along so well.

830
01:06:56,715 --> 01:06:59,479
Why not check
on tomorrow's reservations?

831
01:06:59,551 --> 01:07:00,984
Better yet,

832
01:07:01,053 --> 01:07:04,545
why not make
some reservations for yourself

833
01:07:04,623 --> 01:07:08,559
at some hotel where
you'll soak your feet...

834
01:07:08,627 --> 01:07:11,562
- after a hard day of job hunting.
- But, l...

835
01:07:11,630 --> 01:07:13,791
Don't worry about us.

836
01:07:19,405 --> 01:07:21,339
Want a job, Cliffie?

837
01:07:21,407 --> 01:07:25,104
Now, you just go get a little rest

838
01:07:25,177 --> 01:07:29,443
'cause we got a long night
ahead of us.

839
01:07:29,515 --> 01:07:30,948
All right.

840
01:07:31,016 --> 01:07:33,951
You be here in an hour,

841
01:07:34,019 --> 01:07:36,613
or I'll come after you.

842
01:07:37,690 --> 01:07:41,956
Room 735,
if I'm not right here.

843
01:07:42,027 --> 01:07:46,828
Peache, you run
a nice lively hotel here.

844
01:07:46,899 --> 01:07:48,332
Thank you.

845
01:07:50,536 --> 01:07:51,867
Are you Linderman?

846
01:07:53,572 --> 01:07:57,702
Would you care to
trip the light fantastic?

847
01:07:57,776 --> 01:07:59,334
Mother. No.

848
01:08:01,213 --> 01:08:04,148
Aw, let's go eat.

849
01:08:11,557 --> 01:08:13,650
Go like this.

850
01:08:23,068 --> 01:08:25,593
Drop the bouquet.

851
01:08:27,005 --> 01:08:29,439
Hey.

852
01:08:29,508 --> 01:08:31,442
Hey, terrific heart line.

853
01:08:31,510 --> 01:08:34,536
You got a lot of girlfriends?

854
01:08:34,613 --> 01:08:37,207
- No, ma'am.
- Heh heh.

855
01:08:37,282 --> 01:08:41,446
I'm talking in the future,
smart guy.

856
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:47,459
You're also very
intellectually inclined.

857
01:08:47,526 --> 01:08:50,461
Think that's in the future, too.

858
01:08:50,529 --> 01:08:53,464
I must be right about something.

859
01:08:53,532 --> 01:08:56,330
You sure this is your hand?

860
01:08:56,401 --> 01:08:57,891
Wish I could deny it.

861
01:08:57,970 --> 01:08:59,870
What happened to your wrist?

862
01:08:59,938 --> 01:09:01,496
Nothing.

863
01:09:01,573 --> 01:09:03,006
Accident.

864
01:09:04,710 --> 01:09:06,302
Let me finish.

865
01:09:08,547 --> 01:09:10,481
Open up, Ricky.

866
01:09:10,549 --> 01:09:12,483
You're among friends.

867
01:09:13,552 --> 01:09:15,986
You're among friends.

868
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:32,937
I see a long life line.

869
01:09:33,005 --> 01:09:35,303
Very good.

870
01:09:35,374 --> 01:09:38,935
Very valuable.

871
01:09:44,783 --> 01:09:46,307
You're going to live
for 10 more years.

872
01:09:46,385 --> 01:09:49,445
Then you're going to snuff it.

873
01:09:49,521 --> 01:09:51,455
Mine's broken in half.

874
01:09:51,523 --> 01:09:52,956
- Is it?
- Yeah.

875
01:09:53,025 --> 01:09:54,856
Ooh!
You're going to die.

876
01:09:54,927 --> 01:09:58,363
These are your
need-for-affection lines.

877
01:09:58,430 --> 01:10:00,364
You don't have any.

878
01:10:00,432 --> 01:10:01,865
Look like wrinkles.

879
01:10:01,934 --> 01:10:04,368
He's a sex maniac, here.

880
01:10:08,540 --> 01:10:10,633
Mine says, "love me."

881
01:10:10,709 --> 01:10:12,472
What are you trying...

882
01:10:15,047 --> 01:10:18,312
What does a double-jointed
thumb mean?

883
01:10:20,752 --> 01:10:23,687
I've been looking for you guys.

884
01:10:23,755 --> 01:10:27,691
I've got someone
I want you to meet.

885
01:10:33,098 --> 01:10:35,225
Clifford, this is Mike.

886
01:10:47,646 --> 01:10:51,082
Ricky, this is Mike.

887
01:10:53,151 --> 01:10:54,812
He's my bodyguard.

888
01:11:01,994 --> 01:11:04,428
What do you say, pal?

889
01:11:20,679 --> 01:11:23,944
Moody tells me
you're a tough guy, huh?

890
01:11:24,016 --> 01:11:25,745
You're a real killer.

891
01:11:25,817 --> 01:11:27,478
Is that right?

892
01:11:27,552 --> 01:11:29,486
You beat up kids?

893
01:11:31,023 --> 01:11:32,957
Rape old ladies?

894
01:11:33,025 --> 01:11:34,617
Is that right?

895
01:11:36,028 --> 01:11:37,928
Huh?

896
01:11:39,264 --> 01:11:41,824
I heard you even killed
your own brother.

897
01:11:41,900 --> 01:11:43,834
Got away with it too,
I heard.

898
01:11:43,902 --> 01:11:48,339
- That's bullshit.
- Is it bullshit, huh, Rick?

899
01:11:48,407 --> 01:11:50,341
Huh? Huh?

900
01:11:50,409 --> 01:11:53,845
Is it bullshit?

901
01:11:58,183 --> 01:11:59,411
[Chuckles]

902
01:12:00,819 --> 01:12:03,185
Hey, killer,
why you on your knees?

903
01:12:04,389 --> 01:12:06,653
You queer or something?
Huh?

904
01:12:06,725 --> 01:12:09,091
Come on. Get up.

905
01:12:10,629 --> 01:12:12,062
Huh?

906
01:12:19,137 --> 01:12:21,571
You going to hurt me?

907
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:23,574
You really think
you're gonna hurt me?

908
01:12:23,642 --> 01:12:25,234
Huh?

909
01:12:26,645 --> 01:12:28,010
Huh?

910
01:12:30,582 --> 01:12:33,016
You're not so tough.

911
01:12:33,085 --> 01:12:36,020
Thought you said
this guy is tough.

912
01:12:38,790 --> 01:12:40,223
Yeah, we'll see, huh?

913
01:12:41,293 --> 01:12:42,726
Yeah.

914
01:12:44,296 --> 01:12:46,230
What is this here?

915
01:12:47,799 --> 01:12:49,232
What is that?

916
01:12:49,301 --> 01:12:52,236
That chain's gonna
make you tough?

917
01:12:56,808 --> 01:12:59,743
Tough magazine, huh?
Hey, he reads.

918
01:13:00,445 --> 01:13:02,037
Got an education.

919
01:13:04,916 --> 01:13:07,612
Huh?
You're not so tough.

920
01:13:07,686 --> 01:13:10,450
You're not so tough, are you?

921
01:13:10,522 --> 01:13:14,185
Huh? Huh?

922
01:13:15,260 --> 01:13:16,693
Huh?

923
01:13:16,762 --> 01:13:18,696
You're not so tough.

924
01:13:33,645 --> 01:13:35,078
Come on.

925
01:13:35,147 --> 01:13:36,580
Come on.

926
01:13:38,650 --> 01:13:43,087
Come on with it.
Show me what you got.

927
01:13:47,659 --> 01:13:49,593
Yeah.
Real winner, huh?

928
01:13:49,661 --> 01:13:51,094
A real menace.

929
01:13:55,267 --> 01:13:57,667
Why don't you go kick his ass?

930
01:14:15,019 --> 01:14:16,680
Hey, killer.

931
01:14:16,755 --> 01:14:18,120
Where are you going?

932
01:14:18,189 --> 01:14:20,555
Is this your tough bike?

933
01:14:20,625 --> 01:14:22,217
Huh?

934
01:14:22,293 --> 01:14:23,760
This your tough bike?

935
01:14:23,828 --> 01:14:26,763
Don't look so tough to me.

936
01:14:34,639 --> 01:14:36,834
Think I'm tough enough
to ride this?

937
01:14:36,908 --> 01:14:38,239
Huh?

938
01:14:38,309 --> 01:14:41,870
Come on. Get up.
I think I want to ride it.

939
01:14:41,946 --> 01:14:43,880
I said, get up!

940
01:14:48,286 --> 01:14:51,050
Let's see how tough this bike is.

941
01:14:52,624 --> 01:14:54,057
Hey, don't!

942
01:14:55,794 --> 01:14:57,352
Let me go!

943
01:15:11,309 --> 01:15:14,745
Moody, you said
this guy was bad.

944
01:15:14,813 --> 01:15:17,976
Don't look so bad to me.

945
01:15:18,049 --> 01:15:19,277
Don't!

946
01:15:19,350 --> 01:15:23,514
- What's it take to get him going?
- Get up, man!

947
01:15:23,588 --> 01:15:25,681
Leave him alone.

948
01:15:25,757 --> 01:15:27,190
Hey, this is a drag.

949
01:15:27,258 --> 01:15:29,624
Call me when
you really need me.

950
01:15:29,694 --> 01:15:31,457
I like to earn my money.

951
01:15:34,632 --> 01:15:37,795
Want me to kick your ass?

952
01:15:37,869 --> 01:15:40,269
Yes or no?

953
01:15:43,341 --> 01:15:45,707
Yeah, he wants me
to kick his ass.

954
01:15:45,777 --> 01:15:47,540
Yeah, he wants me
to kick his...

955
01:16:03,828 --> 01:16:05,819
What are you doing, Moody?
Don't. Put the bike back.

956
01:16:05,897 --> 01:16:08,559
Moody, don't do that.

957
01:16:08,633 --> 01:16:10,464
Moody, don't! Moody!

958
01:16:13,204 --> 01:16:14,728
Hey, yeah! Yeah!

959
01:16:46,537 --> 01:16:47,799
Are you okay?

960
01:16:49,107 --> 01:16:51,098
Why didn't you fight?

961
01:16:56,614 --> 01:16:57,740
Where are you going?

962
01:16:59,851 --> 01:17:01,079
Come on,
where are you going?

963
01:17:58,042 --> 01:18:00,237
Anyone there?

964
01:18:02,280 --> 01:18:04,111
Linderman?

965
01:18:41,386 --> 01:18:43,513
Hi. Is Ricky home?

966
01:18:43,588 --> 01:18:45,681
No. Who are you?

967
01:18:45,757 --> 01:18:48,191
I'm a friend from school.

968
01:18:48,259 --> 01:18:52,195
He was supposed
to be home hours ago.

969
01:18:52,263 --> 01:18:54,697
What's your name?

970
01:18:54,766 --> 01:18:57,860
- Clifford.
- If you see him,

971
01:18:57,935 --> 01:19:00,870
tell him he should get home.

972
01:19:00,938 --> 01:19:02,030
Okay.

973
01:20:02,433 --> 01:20:03,457
Hey.

974
01:20:06,104 --> 01:20:08,937
How did you get up here?

975
01:20:09,006 --> 01:20:11,770
I need some money.

976
01:20:11,843 --> 01:20:14,710
Where were you?
I looked everywhere for you.

977
01:20:14,779 --> 01:20:16,872
You got any money?

978
01:20:16,948 --> 01:20:19,883
Come on.
Give me some money.

979
01:20:26,958 --> 01:20:29,893
Six bucks is all I got.

980
01:20:35,466 --> 01:20:37,832
Thanks, Cliff.
You're a good kid.

981
01:20:37,902 --> 01:20:39,802
Oh, well, that's great.

982
01:20:39,871 --> 01:20:42,135
"Give me money. Thanks, bye."
That's real class.

983
01:20:46,978 --> 01:20:48,104
Where are you going?

984
01:20:56,053 --> 01:20:57,145
Linderman!

985
01:21:04,061 --> 01:21:05,153
Linderman!

986
01:21:36,761 --> 01:21:38,194
Wait up!

987
01:21:45,770 --> 01:21:47,032
Linderman!

988
01:21:50,942 --> 01:21:52,034
Linderman.

989
01:22:10,628 --> 01:22:12,562
Wait up, damn it!

990
01:22:19,970 --> 01:22:23,406
- Slow down, will you?
- Go home, Clifford.

991
01:22:23,474 --> 01:22:27,410
You got a nice place, a nice family.
Just leave me alone.

992
01:22:27,478 --> 01:22:30,413
- It's the fight, isn't it?
- I couldn't fight. So what?

993
01:22:30,481 --> 01:22:35,009
I never wanted to be anyone's damned
bodyguard, anyway. I told you that.

994
01:22:35,085 --> 01:22:36,780
It's on account
of your brother.

995
01:22:36,854 --> 01:22:38,446
You can't fight because of
what happened to your brother.

996
01:22:38,522 --> 01:22:41,491
- That's it, isn't it?
- What do you know?

997
01:22:41,559 --> 01:22:43,686
It's a lousy excuse.
It's nothing, Linderman.

998
01:22:43,761 --> 01:22:45,854
Shut up!

999
01:22:47,631 --> 01:22:51,032
You haven't talked
for over a year.

1000
01:22:51,101 --> 01:22:53,126
- You walk like an ape for nothing.
- Shut up, Clifford!

1001
01:22:53,203 --> 01:22:56,639
You build a bike to run away
for no reason, to go nowhere.

1002
01:22:56,707 --> 01:22:57,696
And let some jerk
throw it into the lake.

1003
01:22:57,775 --> 01:22:58,707
Shut up!

1004
01:22:58,776 --> 01:23:00,971
All because of something
you had nothing to do with.

1005
01:23:01,045 --> 01:23:03,377
I mean, anybody
could've found your brother.

1006
01:23:03,447 --> 01:23:05,039
It happened to be you.

1007
01:23:05,115 --> 01:23:08,050
Shut up!
I didn't find him!

1008
01:23:08,118 --> 01:23:10,177
I killed him!

1009
01:23:10,888 --> 01:23:12,321
I shot him!

1010
01:23:14,191 --> 01:23:16,591
Jesus.

1011
01:23:22,566 --> 01:23:24,500
We were home alone.

1012
01:23:24,568 --> 01:23:26,001
We were playing
with my dad's gun.

1013
01:23:26,070 --> 01:23:31,007
I was showing off
like a goddamn fool.

1014
01:23:32,910 --> 01:23:35,344
He wanted to hold it.

1015
01:23:35,412 --> 01:23:38,279
I said you're not allowed to.

1016
01:23:38,349 --> 01:23:41,284
He grabbed it, and it fired.

1017
01:23:42,519 --> 01:23:46,956
My God, I was laughing
when it went off.

1018
01:23:50,194 --> 01:23:54,631
Blood gushed out of the side of
his head, and he didn't even know it.

1019
01:24:00,537 --> 01:24:02,971
Know what he worried about?

1020
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:06,976
That when Dad got home,
he'd get spanked.

1021
01:24:10,214 --> 01:24:13,149
The last thing he said to me,

1022
01:24:13,217 --> 01:24:17,449
he said, "You're gonna have
to take the blame for this one."

1023
01:24:17,521 --> 01:24:19,148
I couldn't even do that right.

1024
01:24:19,223 --> 01:24:22,659
I lied.
I put the gun in his hand

1025
01:24:22,726 --> 01:24:25,991
and said I found him that way.

1026
01:24:27,064 --> 01:24:28,497
Damn it.

1027
01:24:34,905 --> 01:24:37,271
I never told anyone before.

1028
01:24:50,688 --> 01:24:54,124
It wasn't your fault. You didn't mean
for it to happen.

1029
01:24:56,694 --> 01:25:00,630
I'm sorry, Clifford.
I know you mean well.

1030
01:25:00,698 --> 01:25:05,135
I let everybody down.
It's the way I am.

1031
01:25:07,771 --> 01:25:09,796
Go home, Clifford.

1032
01:25:40,204 --> 01:25:41,296
Hey.

1033
01:25:42,372 --> 01:25:43,805
Where's the funeral?

1034
01:25:44,875 --> 01:25:47,309
It can't be that bad.

1035
01:25:47,377 --> 01:25:49,311
It's worse than ever.

1036
01:25:49,379 --> 01:25:51,813
They took my bus fare.

1037
01:25:51,882 --> 01:25:54,442
They flushed my lunch
down the john.

1038
01:25:54,518 --> 01:25:57,817
They called my mother names
I never even heard of.

1039
01:25:57,888 --> 01:26:02,154
I'm going to quit school.
I'll never graduate anyway.

1040
01:26:02,226 --> 01:26:05,593
- Where are you going?
- Home, I guess.

1041
01:26:05,662 --> 01:26:07,630
Come on.
I'll buy you both a drink.

1042
01:26:07,698 --> 01:26:11,634
- He might have tried calling.
- He'll be back.

1043
01:26:11,702 --> 01:26:14,136
- He just needs time to think.
- Hope you're right.

1044
01:26:14,204 --> 01:26:18,641
I'm always right.
That's what you'll learn about me.

1045
01:26:18,709 --> 01:26:23,146
Someday you'll say, "Shelley, darling,
you're always right."

1046
01:26:25,883 --> 01:26:28,818
Hey, look. Over there.
It's Linderman.

1047
01:26:55,512 --> 01:26:59,448
Did you get that
out of there yourself?

1048
01:26:59,516 --> 01:27:01,450
I know.
Dumb question.

1049
01:27:02,686 --> 01:27:04,745
I was really scared.

1050
01:27:08,192 --> 01:27:09,853
I can cheat, can't I?

1051
01:27:09,927 --> 01:27:11,827
It's only a game.
Go ahead.

1052
01:27:17,701 --> 01:27:22,138
Hey, where did you guys find my bike?
You been fishing?

1053
01:27:24,975 --> 01:27:26,806
Oh, no.

1054
01:27:27,878 --> 01:27:29,812
Thanks. I'll take it now.

1055
01:27:39,156 --> 01:27:40,589
Hey, Mike.

1056
01:27:42,726 --> 01:27:44,125
Moody, you're a real bastard.

1057
01:27:52,936 --> 01:27:58,238
Linderman, you picking
on Moody again? Huh?

1058
01:27:58,308 --> 01:28:01,141
- You're really beginning to annoy me.
- Look.

1059
01:28:01,211 --> 01:28:02,143
Just don't give us any trouble.

1060
01:28:02,212 --> 01:28:03,645
- Enough is enough.
- Get out!

1061
01:28:06,049 --> 01:28:09,985
You got three seconds
to make your split.

1062
01:28:10,053 --> 01:28:11,486
Now get.

1063
01:28:16,059 --> 01:28:17,492
Uh-uh.

1064
01:28:18,562 --> 01:28:22,157
- Without the bike.
- [Moody Chuckles]

1065
01:28:22,232 --> 01:28:23,665
It's Moody's now.

1066
01:28:27,738 --> 01:28:29,069
One...

1067
01:28:33,243 --> 01:28:38,010
- two...
- I tell you, some guys never learn.

1068
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:45,954
Okay. Take it.

1069
01:28:49,860 --> 01:28:52,795
Ahhhh!

1070
01:28:58,702 --> 01:29:00,636
Get on him, Mike!

1071
01:29:05,375 --> 01:29:06,967
Okay. Okay.

1072
01:29:08,211 --> 01:29:09,644
Come on, Mike.

1073
01:29:13,050 --> 01:29:14,483
Come on.

1074
01:29:20,791 --> 01:29:22,383
Come on, Ricky.
Come on.

1075
01:30:07,070 --> 01:30:08,094
Damn you, Moody!

1076
01:30:45,175 --> 01:30:46,699
Moody?

1077
01:30:59,356 --> 01:31:02,883
Get up.
Get up.

1078
01:31:02,959 --> 01:31:05,257
Slow down.
Slow down.

1079
01:31:05,328 --> 01:31:08,889
- Cover up.
- Come on, man.

1080
01:31:08,965 --> 01:31:10,899
Get him.

1081
01:31:18,542 --> 01:31:20,100
Come on, get him!

1082
01:31:20,176 --> 01:31:21,268
Get him!

1083
01:31:34,724 --> 01:31:37,158
Come on!
Hit him, kid!

1084
01:31:44,668 --> 01:31:46,966
Come on. You want
your ass kicked. Come on!

1085
01:31:47,037 --> 01:31:48,629
Come on, you faggot.
Come on, wimp.

1086
01:31:49,839 --> 01:31:51,466
Go for his nose.

1087
01:31:51,541 --> 01:31:55,307
Thanks. You're a wonderful
human being. You know that?

1088
01:31:55,378 --> 01:31:57,676
You need your damn bodyguard?
Come on!

1089
01:31:57,747 --> 01:32:00,944
Get him.

1090
01:32:21,404 --> 01:32:23,395
Clifford, get him in the nose.

1091
01:32:29,546 --> 01:32:32,071
Oh, my nose.

1092
01:32:38,588 --> 01:32:40,920
You broke my nose.

1093
01:32:40,991 --> 01:32:43,755
I really think I broke his nose.

1094
01:32:43,827 --> 01:32:48,230
- You broke my nose.
- You did do it.

1095
01:32:56,940 --> 01:32:58,373
So did you.

1096
01:32:59,609 --> 01:33:02,812
It looks better that way.

1097
01:33:04,446 --> 01:33:06,880
Oh, my nose, man!

1098
01:33:06,949 --> 01:33:08,883
Hey, Moody!

1099
01:33:11,854 --> 01:33:13,879
All right.

1100
01:33:13,956 --> 01:33:15,287
Way to go.

1101
01:33:16,358 --> 01:33:19,156
Real impressive fight.

1102
01:33:23,399 --> 01:33:24,423
Okay, all right.

1103
01:33:29,972 --> 01:33:31,906
I have a question.

1104
01:33:31,974 --> 01:33:33,908
I had this idea.

1105
01:33:33,976 --> 01:33:35,910
You're a good fighter.

1106
01:33:35,978 --> 01:33:38,139
Would you like to be
my bodyguard?

1107
01:33:38,214 --> 01:33:40,444
I could pay you
50 cents a day.

1108
01:33:40,516 --> 01:33:43,007
I can do your homework for you.
I'm pretty smart.

1109
01:33:43,085 --> 01:33:45,519
Not interested.

1110
01:33:47,590 --> 01:33:49,182
Anyway, a buck a day.

1111
01:33:49,258 --> 01:33:50,190
A buck a day?

1112
01:33:50,259 --> 01:33:51,453
Buck a day.
Inflation, buddy.

1113
01:33:51,527 --> 01:33:52,459
Inflation?

1114
01:33:52,528 --> 01:33:53,460
Yeah.

1115
01:33:53,529 --> 01:33:55,588
Wait a minute.
