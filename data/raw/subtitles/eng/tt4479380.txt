00:00:53,512 --> 00:00:57,215
(man) <i>Less than one percent of
the population is psychopathic.</i>

3
00:00:57,249 --> 00:01:00,787
<i>Psychopaths often
inherit the trait</i>

4
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:03,555
<i>and are incapable of love.</i>

5
00:01:03,588 --> 00:01:07,660
<i>They manage their relationships
with clinical precision,</i>

6
00:01:07,694 --> 00:01:11,229
<i>succeeding
in all walks of life.</i>

7
00:01:11,263 --> 00:01:15,702
<i>Psychopaths that can learn
to love are even more rare.</i>

8
00:01:15,735 --> 00:01:18,938
<i>As rare as a black swan.</i>

9
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:21,741
It's time.

10
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:25,712
I'm not dead yet.

11
00:01:25,745 --> 00:01:31,383
Naming a successor is a sign of
strength, not weakness, Father.

12
00:01:31,416 --> 00:01:33,753
You've always had more ambition
than your brother.

13
00:01:33,786 --> 00:01:35,988
(woman) <i>Olly is more ambitious
than you think.</i>

14
00:01:36,022 --> 00:01:39,759
(man) There's a difference
between ambition and pride.

15
00:01:39,792 --> 00:01:41,393
He's just trying to impress you.

16
00:01:41,426 --> 00:01:44,897
Well, no matter how hard
your brother tries,

17
00:01:44,931 --> 00:01:46,899
<i>he'll always be replaceable.</i>

18
00:01:46,933 --> 00:01:48,968
(woman) <i>Boy, does he know
you feel that way.</i>

19
00:01:49,001 --> 00:01:53,305
I don't care,
and neither should you.

20
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:33,946
(Olly) Last one of the day,
boys. Let's light her up.

21
00:02:35,681 --> 00:02:37,784
Stay professional.

22
00:02:47,026 --> 00:02:49,594
- Morning.
- Was when I got here.

23
00:02:49,629 --> 00:02:52,364
- What did you offer 'em?
- Fifty fucking grand.

24
00:02:52,397 --> 00:02:54,366
Well, that's twice
what you paid for the delay.

25
00:02:54,399 --> 00:02:55,735
Yeah, I already paid 'em
a hundred.

26
00:02:55,768 --> 00:02:57,103
Pissed it away
on whores and vodka.

27
00:02:57,136 --> 00:02:58,971
Yeah, well, do you blame 'em?

28
00:02:59,005 --> 00:03:02,809
No. I mean, I wouldn't wanna
live in that fucking shithole.

29
00:03:02,842 --> 00:03:04,442
Well, they want more money.

30
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:07,113
Clearly. Alright,
increase the offer,

31
00:03:07,146 --> 00:03:10,382
but if it goes noisy,
that's what you're here for.

32
00:03:10,415 --> 00:03:11,583
Grace.

33
00:03:14,787 --> 00:03:17,857
What's a fair price
for that village?

34
00:03:19,158 --> 00:03:21,359
Two hundred?

35
00:03:21,393 --> 00:03:26,866
OK, well, if they refuse,
cut their tongues out.

36
00:03:26,899 --> 00:03:28,333
(chuckles)

37
00:03:29,635 --> 00:03:31,671
- Is she capable of that?
- Of course.

38
00:03:31,704 --> 00:03:34,006
Well, if she fucks it up,
it's down to you.

39
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:37,143
I just need that village
cleared today, alright?

40
00:03:37,176 --> 00:03:40,713
Hey, Pop, is it unprofessional
to burn him?

41
00:03:42,148 --> 00:03:46,384
My God, Olly. You really do
have shit for brains.

42
00:04:06,906 --> 00:04:10,109
(dogs bark)

43
00:04:24,857 --> 00:04:26,893
Enemy front!

44
00:04:30,863 --> 00:04:32,632
(woman screams)

45
00:04:34,599 --> 00:04:36,202
(man shouts)

46
00:04:36,235 --> 00:04:38,403
(yells)

47
00:04:39,205 --> 00:04:41,606
Go, go, go! Go. Up the hill.

48
00:04:41,641 --> 00:04:43,441
(men shouting)

49
00:04:49,547 --> 00:04:52,652
(man over radio) <i>Switch fire
right. Switch fire right. Out.</i>

50
00:04:52,685 --> 00:04:55,453
- Oh, it's just a scratch.
- (groans)

51
00:04:55,487 --> 00:04:57,023
You're good.

52
00:04:58,858 --> 00:05:01,093
(men shouting)

53
00:05:12,138 --> 00:05:14,640
(gunfire continues)

54
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:24,917
They don't want money.

55
00:05:24,951 --> 00:05:27,186
They want a fight.

56
00:05:28,287 --> 00:05:31,057
Make a decision. Make it now.

57
00:05:33,693 --> 00:05:35,761
Kill the men and the boys,

58
00:05:35,795 --> 00:05:38,097
and leave the women
to spread the fear.

59
00:05:51,243 --> 00:05:52,645
(gunshot)

60
00:05:55,781 --> 00:05:57,850
(gunshot)

61
00:05:57,883 --> 00:06:00,953
(screaming)

62
00:06:13,899 --> 00:06:17,203
(screams)

63
00:06:19,238 --> 00:06:21,674
(shouting)

64
00:06:34,787 --> 00:06:36,621
(screaming)

65
00:07:33,179 --> 00:07:35,848
Welcome home, Thomas.

66
00:07:35,881 --> 00:07:38,317
Great to see you, Callum.
Looking good as always.

67
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:39,885
You staying for Christmas?

68
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,854
I just came
to pick something up.

69
00:07:41,887 --> 00:07:44,690
That's my job. Tell me what you
need. I'll organize some tea.

70
00:07:44,723 --> 00:07:49,228
Thanks, but I'd rather do it
myself. It's in Nanna's box.

71
00:07:49,261 --> 00:07:53,032
- Well, that is a surprise.
- To me as well.

72
00:07:53,065 --> 00:07:55,768
Be nice to have some laughter
in the house.

73
00:07:55,801 --> 00:07:57,203
(Thomas) Early days.

74
00:07:57,236 --> 00:07:59,405
I plan to keep my flat
but weekend here.

75
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:01,140
If Sophie fancies it.

76
00:08:01,173 --> 00:08:05,044
Will she be needing
color charts for the nursery?

77
00:08:05,077 --> 00:08:06,378
You're worse than my mother.

78
00:08:06,412 --> 00:08:08,414
She would have been proud.

79
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,949
Somehow I doubt that.

80
00:08:09,982 --> 00:08:11,684
Thomas, your parents were...

81
00:08:11,717 --> 00:08:13,886
My parents
were wildly disappointed in me.

82
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,822
Your nanna would have approved.

83
00:08:16,856 --> 00:08:18,290
Did you fix the windows
in her library?

84
00:08:18,324 --> 00:08:19,959
All done, sir.

85
00:08:19,992 --> 00:08:23,162
We also planted
another 40 acres of oak.

86
00:08:23,195 --> 00:08:24,396
Her favorite.

87
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:26,832
That would be you, sir.

88
00:08:28,167 --> 00:08:30,369
- Thank you, Callum.
- Of course, sir.

89
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,756
Having second thoughts?

90
00:09:25,057 --> 00:09:26,292
Never.

91
00:09:26,325 --> 00:09:28,761
What is it, then?

92
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:36,068
Did Nanna really love Grandpa?

93
00:09:36,902 --> 00:09:38,470
In her own way.

94
00:09:40,339 --> 00:09:43,008
Could you be any more obtuse?

95
00:09:43,042 --> 00:09:45,511
She had a special way
of seeing the world,

96
00:09:45,544 --> 00:09:48,013
including your grandfather.

97
00:09:48,047 --> 00:09:50,482
For her, it was love.

98
00:09:51,951 --> 00:09:53,419
You understand?

99
00:09:55,487 --> 00:09:57,156
Beginning to.

100
00:09:57,189 --> 00:10:00,092
That's why she wanted you
to have that ring.

101
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:01,927
The great Henry Buckingham

102
00:10:01,961 --> 00:10:03,996
chopped it off
the maharaja's finger

103
00:10:04,029 --> 00:10:05,798
during the Indian Mutiny

104
00:10:05,831 --> 00:10:09,101
and bequeathed it to her
upon his passing.

105
00:10:10,369 --> 00:10:13,105
So the story goes.

106
00:10:13,138 --> 00:10:15,107
Your nanna did keep her secrets.

107
00:10:18,177 --> 00:10:21,013
Guess we'll never know
the truth.

108
00:10:21,046 --> 00:10:23,782
I know she would be pleased.

109
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:27,519
Sophie is a fine choice, Thomas.

110
00:10:29,888 --> 00:10:31,357
Then it's time.

111
00:10:35,494 --> 00:10:37,162
(man) <i>This just in
from our sources.</i>

112
00:10:37,196 --> 00:10:38,931
Red Notices have been issued

113
00:10:38,964 --> 00:10:41,500
for three members
of the notorious Black Swans,

114
00:10:41,533 --> 00:10:43,969
a family-owned
private military company

115
00:10:44,003 --> 00:10:47,006
linked to alleged atrocities
in the Republic of Georgia.

116
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:49,208
The three are Americans
William Lewis

117
00:10:49,241 --> 00:10:52,111
and his adult children,
Grace and Oliver Lewis.

118
00:10:52,144 --> 00:10:54,580
The family is reported
to be living in North London.

119
00:10:54,613 --> 00:10:56,548
They're accused
of crimes against humanity

120
00:10:56,582 --> 00:11:00,019
following an alleged massacre
that has only now come to light.

121
00:11:00,052 --> 00:11:02,121
<i>The remote area
where it happened</i>

122
00:11:02,154 --> 00:11:05,457
<i>is known as a corridor for
transnational gas pipelines.</i>

123
00:11:05,491 --> 00:11:08,093
<i>The International
Criminal Court is demanding</i>

124
00:11:08,127 --> 00:11:10,496
<i>that the UK extradite
the accused to the Hague</i>

125
00:11:10,529 --> 00:11:12,164
<i>where they will stand trial.</i>

126
00:11:12,197 --> 00:11:13,966
<i>The prime minister's office
has so far</i>

127
00:11:13,999 --> 00:11:15,868
<i>refused to comment
on the Red Notices</i>

128
00:11:15,901 --> 00:11:17,903
<i>or whether it plans
to serve them,</i>

129
00:11:17,936 --> 00:11:21,073
<i>but we're waiting for further
updates from Number Ten.</i>

130
00:11:21,106 --> 00:11:24,410
<i>(gunfire and screaming
on video)</i>

131
00:11:37,256 --> 00:11:38,991
It wasn't
what we hired him to do.

132
00:11:39,024 --> 00:11:40,526
Doesn't matter.

133
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:44,129
He stands trial,
Lewis will say we sanctioned it.

134
00:11:44,163 --> 00:11:47,266
Well, you're PM.
What do you wanna do?

135
00:11:49,168 --> 00:11:51,203
I mean, we could kick him
into the long grass.

136
00:11:51,236 --> 00:11:54,206
You could do. But you do know
this is not gonna blow over?

137
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:56,643
Mercenaries have been tearing
the arse out of it for decades.

138
00:11:56,676 --> 00:11:59,912
They may have done, but now
every fucker has a mobile phone.

139
00:11:59,945 --> 00:12:02,147
- Fair one.
- We could deport him.

140
00:12:02,181 --> 00:12:04,316
No. The Yanks
won't eat our shit.

141
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:07,052
Lewis lives here.
He does his business here.

142
00:12:07,086 --> 00:12:09,154
He's been here
for 40 years or so.

143
00:12:09,188 --> 00:12:10,923
He's just bought
the Habsburg House.

144
00:12:10,956 --> 00:12:12,391
- What, in Hampstead Heath?
- Yeah.

145
00:12:12,424 --> 00:12:14,360
Clearly we're paying him
too much.

146
00:12:14,393 --> 00:12:16,362
Well, keeping our hands clean
is a pricey business.

147
00:12:16,395 --> 00:12:18,665
And at that price, I expect them
to be washed of this shite.

148
00:12:18,698 --> 00:12:21,133
There is a difference
between disavowing Lewis

149
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:22,968
and serving him
with a Red Notice.

150
00:12:23,001 --> 00:12:24,603
He will expect
a level of protection.

151
00:12:24,637 --> 00:12:28,675
No. I cannot be seen
to protect a war criminal.

152
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:31,043
So do you want me to go round
his house and arrest him?

153
00:12:31,076 --> 00:12:33,979
No, I never said anything
about an arrest.

154
00:12:37,015 --> 00:12:38,550
Lewis will have prepared
for that too.

155
00:12:38,584 --> 00:12:40,285
There's a reason we hired him
in the first place.

156
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:42,621
And there's a reason
I hired you.

157
00:12:54,466 --> 00:12:55,934
Natalie, can I grab those notes?

158
00:12:55,968 --> 00:12:57,569
Yes, Doctor.

159
00:12:57,603 --> 00:12:58,638
- Thank you.
- There you go.

160
00:12:58,671 --> 00:13:00,606
- Hi, Dr Hart.
- Hi.

161
00:13:05,477 --> 00:13:07,413
Surprise.

162
00:13:09,181 --> 00:13:12,050
- Surprise?
- First-class ticket to Paris.

163
00:13:12,084 --> 00:13:14,319
Flight's at 1:30 tomorrow.

164
00:13:17,022 --> 00:13:19,324
Tom, that's lovely, but...

165
00:13:19,358 --> 00:13:22,594
I rang Dr. Wells.
She agreed to take your shifts.

166
00:13:22,629 --> 00:13:24,430
I haven't spoken to you
in three weeks,

167
00:13:24,463 --> 00:13:26,265
and the first person you call
is my consultant

168
00:13:26,298 --> 00:13:27,399
to change my schedule?

169
00:13:27,433 --> 00:13:31,503
- Yeah.
- Tom, that's not OK.

170
00:13:31,537 --> 00:13:33,205
You've been dying
to go to Paris.

171
00:13:33,238 --> 00:13:34,641
I've been dying
to spend some time with you.

172
00:13:34,674 --> 00:13:37,309
Good thing
we're going together, then.

173
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,516
Tom, stop.

174
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:47,052
I'm sorry.
Gotta sort something at work.

175
00:13:47,085 --> 00:13:49,321
- But you just got back.
- It won't take long.

176
00:13:49,354 --> 00:13:51,390
I've heard that one before.

177
00:13:51,423 --> 00:13:53,358
It'll be alright.

178
00:13:54,526 --> 00:13:56,696
Meet you at the airport.

179
00:13:58,397 --> 00:14:01,133
- I haven't said yes yet.
- Don't be late.

180
00:14:02,067 --> 00:14:03,736
Silly fucker.

181
00:14:04,737 --> 00:14:07,372
Hi, James. How's your leg today?

182
00:14:26,091 --> 00:14:28,560
(chatter)

183
00:14:28,594 --> 00:14:31,163
I need everyone out. Now.

184
00:14:31,196 --> 00:14:34,333
(Olly) Yeah, come on,
everyone out. Let's go.

185
00:14:37,202 --> 00:14:38,203
(Grace sighs)

186
00:14:38,237 --> 00:14:39,471
I just got a message.

187
00:14:39,505 --> 00:14:42,074
The SAS is about to move on us.

188
00:14:43,609 --> 00:14:48,113
We can book a G4
out of Farnborough,

189
00:14:48,146 --> 00:14:50,482
fly home,
take our chances there.

190
00:14:51,483 --> 00:14:53,385
England is home.

191
00:14:53,418 --> 00:14:58,825
Dad. After all these years,
you're still not one of them.

192
00:14:58,858 --> 00:15:02,127
- Never will be.
- Well, that's true.

193
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,264
I'm one of me. So are you.

194
00:15:07,499 --> 00:15:11,370
Clements was just
using us anyway.

195
00:15:11,403 --> 00:15:15,407
No. I've been using him
for my own means.

196
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,278
This government is addicted
to what we do for them.

197
00:15:24,149 --> 00:15:27,185
In three to four hours, they're
gonna break down that door

198
00:15:27,219 --> 00:15:28,587
and they are gonna arrest us.

199
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:31,256
The last thing they want
is an arrest.

200
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:34,827
If I'd seen that girl
with the phone...

201
00:15:34,861 --> 00:15:38,330
- Next time.
- (sighs)

202
00:15:38,363 --> 00:15:41,634
There won't be one
unless we do something now.

203
00:15:43,201 --> 00:15:45,437
What would you have us do?

204
00:15:47,573 --> 00:15:49,174
Enact the safeguard.

205
00:15:50,275 --> 00:15:52,277
Big job.

206
00:15:52,311 --> 00:15:55,113
Simulated it six times.

207
00:15:55,147 --> 00:15:58,216
Casualties always
a hundred percent.

208
00:16:00,687 --> 00:16:02,889
We're about to get shot
in the back.

209
00:16:02,922 --> 00:16:06,258
Anything else from here
is a bonus.

210
00:16:11,864 --> 00:16:14,333
(Grace sighs)

211
00:16:17,369 --> 00:16:18,570
OK.

212
00:16:37,824 --> 00:16:39,759
Are those pansies?

213
00:16:41,526 --> 00:16:42,895
Yeah. Yeah, they are.

214
00:16:42,929 --> 00:16:46,465
I'm with the Heath
and Hampstead Society.

215
00:16:46,498 --> 00:16:47,934
Each year
we select one household

216
00:16:47,967 --> 00:16:49,468
with the finest winter blossoms

217
00:16:49,501 --> 00:16:50,737
and feature it on our website.

218
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:52,571
Thanks,
but we're not interested.

219
00:16:52,604 --> 00:16:56,508
That's a shame. You've done
such a brilliant job.

220
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:59,679
I'm gonna have to ask you
to leave. I'm a bit tired.

221
00:17:02,314 --> 00:17:06,585
Are the pansies
more fragrant to you?

222
00:17:06,618 --> 00:17:08,855
No, not really. Why?

223
00:17:08,888 --> 00:17:10,957
Some women develop
a better sense of smell

224
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:12,524
when they're pregnant.

225
00:17:12,557 --> 00:17:15,260
That's something
to look forward to.

226
00:17:15,293 --> 00:17:18,296
- If you don't mind...
- How many months are you?

227
00:17:18,831 --> 00:17:20,599
Six.

228
00:17:20,633 --> 00:17:22,501
Boy or a girl?

229
00:17:22,534 --> 00:17:24,737
They can't tell yet.

230
00:17:30,342 --> 00:17:32,779
You can determine the sex
of a child at three months.

231
00:17:32,812 --> 00:17:36,448
And they're primroses.
Not pansies.

232
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:45,992
Red 1. I'm compromised out here.

233
00:17:46,025 --> 00:17:48,393
- Sitrep on the woman.
- <i>Neutralized.</i>

234
00:17:48,427 --> 00:17:50,395
- What about the baby?
- No baby.

235
00:17:50,429 --> 00:17:54,566
Just a fake belly rig
concealing an automatic short.

236
00:17:56,636 --> 00:17:59,538
- Olivia, who is she?
- She works security for Lewis.

237
00:17:59,571 --> 00:18:03,608
There's a 76% probability
that he is on target.

238
00:18:03,976 --> 00:18:05,878
OK.

239
00:18:05,912 --> 00:18:08,413
Alpha. To confirm,
this is a hard arrest

240
00:18:08,447 --> 00:18:11,249
on a William Lewis
and known associates,

241
00:18:11,283 --> 00:18:12,819
aka the Black Swans,

242
00:18:12,852 --> 00:18:17,657
under Red Notice 790274
for crimes against humanity.

243
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:19,357
(Tom) <i>Confirmed.</i>

244
00:18:19,391 --> 00:18:20,993
There will be no threat
to their life or reason.

245
00:18:21,027 --> 00:18:23,395
You will serve the Red Notice
using nonlethal means.

246
00:18:23,428 --> 00:18:25,665
- <i>Confirmed.</i>
- Stop fucking about.

247
00:18:25,698 --> 00:18:27,432
Red Notice calls for
a hard arrestment.

248
00:18:27,466 --> 00:18:28,768
The moment you make contact,

249
00:18:28,801 --> 00:18:30,670
you will fight
and you will kill him.

250
00:18:30,703 --> 00:18:32,304
This is London, not Londonderry.

251
00:18:32,337 --> 00:18:34,406
Enemy front. Enemy front.

252
00:18:34,439 --> 00:18:38,778
<i>All call signs, this is Alpha.
I have control. Go, go, go.</i>

253
00:18:38,811 --> 00:18:40,913
There you go, mate.
That's yours.

254
00:18:46,418 --> 00:18:47,552
Coming through.

255
00:18:47,586 --> 00:18:50,355
Smoke. Get the smoke down now.

256
00:18:54,761 --> 00:18:57,864
<i>Red 6. Man down. Man down.</i>

257
00:18:57,897 --> 00:19:01,600
<i>Alpha. Roger that.
My call sign moving now.</i>

258
00:19:19,685 --> 00:19:21,386
Cover.

259
00:19:21,419 --> 00:19:23,388
Oh, fuck that.

260
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:28,027
Sierra 1. I had to take it.

261
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:29,427
<i>Alpha.</i>

262
00:19:31,363 --> 00:19:32,999
<i>Red 7. Held at the rear.</i>

263
00:19:33,032 --> 00:19:37,369
<i>Cannot make entry.
I say again: cannot make entry.</i>

264
00:19:37,402 --> 00:19:38,537
Fuck it.

265
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:45,510
Come on, mate. Smash it.

266
00:19:48,047 --> 00:19:49,015
Come on.

267
00:19:49,048 --> 00:19:50,482
Oh, shit.

268
00:19:52,584 --> 00:19:53,686
Red 1. Need door entry.

269
00:19:53,719 --> 00:19:55,721
Alpha. Roger that.

270
00:19:55,755 --> 00:19:58,323
Red 3. Moving now.

271
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:03,963
Clear!

272
00:20:16,709 --> 00:20:18,978
- (gun clicks)
- Stoppage! Stoppage!

273
00:20:22,882 --> 00:20:25,084
- Clear!
- Up.

274
00:20:29,989 --> 00:20:32,925
<i>That's Red 9.
Checking the garage. Out.</i>

275
00:20:42,567 --> 00:20:44,469
Don't move! Don't move!

276
00:20:56,182 --> 00:20:58,885
Lewis confirmed. Dining room.

277
00:20:59,785 --> 00:21:01,187
Any eyes on Grace?

278
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,955
(Tom) Unsighted.

279
00:21:02,989 --> 00:21:05,858
<i>Sierra 1. I've got movement
on the ground floor.</i>

280
00:21:05,892 --> 00:21:09,561
(commander)
<i>Red 1. Check it. Out.</i>

281
00:21:09,594 --> 00:21:13,699
<i>Sierra 1.
That's moving up the stairwell.</i>

282
00:21:13,733 --> 00:21:15,533
<i>Now unsighted.</i>

283
00:21:15,567 --> 00:21:17,103
<i>(footsteps on stairs)</i>

284
00:21:36,521 --> 00:21:38,658
Just in time for lunch.

285
00:21:39,191 --> 00:21:40,826
Where's Grace?

286
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:44,063
Upstairs. Getting dressed.

287
00:21:44,697 --> 00:21:46,232
Oi.

288
00:21:46,265 --> 00:21:48,701
Fuck off and do your job.

289
00:21:51,603 --> 00:21:53,139
Roger that.

290
00:22:05,117 --> 00:22:09,155
Wow.
It's like a fucking museum.

291
00:22:09,188 --> 00:22:13,859
I needed somewhere to put my
stuff. It's been a busy life.

292
00:22:13,893 --> 00:22:18,230
Yeah, I know what you mean.
I've got tons of this shit.

293
00:22:18,264 --> 00:22:20,800
I'm still going.

294
00:22:20,833 --> 00:22:22,835
And you're about to stop.

295
00:22:24,704 --> 00:22:26,504
Tom, man on! Man on!

296
00:22:37,016 --> 00:22:39,752
Stitched up
by a kid with a mobile.

297
00:22:39,785 --> 00:22:42,121
Thank fuck they didn't have 'em
in Rhodesia.

298
00:22:42,154 --> 00:22:45,091
(chuckles)

299
00:22:45,124 --> 00:22:47,927
- Good skills on this job.
- Thank you.

300
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,796
Word has it
that Grace did the sniping.

301
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:52,832
Tell 'em that I did that.

302
00:22:52,865 --> 00:22:56,635
If Grace sticks with that story,
I'll ensure she's looked after.

303
00:22:56,669 --> 00:22:58,771
What, by the PM?

304
00:22:58,804 --> 00:23:03,876
Politicians come and go, mate.
I'm the consistency.

305
00:23:06,645 --> 00:23:08,180
Grace is...

306
00:23:10,883 --> 00:23:12,517
Grace is good value.

307
00:23:13,719 --> 00:23:16,088
Every father
loves their daughter.

308
00:23:16,122 --> 00:23:19,658
I've never loved anybody
in my life.

309
00:23:20,292 --> 00:23:23,863
But Grace is special.

310
00:23:23,896 --> 00:23:25,898
In what way?

311
00:23:25,931 --> 00:23:29,702
Well, she's like me.
Only better.

312
00:23:38,344 --> 00:23:41,847
(Clements) <i>Grace isn't joining
us for lunch, is she, Lewis?</i>

313
00:23:41,881 --> 00:23:44,083
(Lewis) <i>You're gonna miss me,
George.</i>

314
00:23:44,116 --> 00:23:46,352
(Clements) <i>I'm not gonna miss
cleaning up your mess.</i>

315
00:23:46,385 --> 00:23:48,854
If you could do it
with peace, love

316
00:23:48,888 --> 00:23:52,024
and a steak dinner, you would.

317
00:23:52,058 --> 00:23:56,162
Everyone is replaceable.
Even a Black Swan.

318
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:05,304
(gunshots)

319
00:24:09,809 --> 00:24:13,946
- Stand still! Stand still!
- Stand still! Stand still!

320
00:24:13,979 --> 00:24:16,215
(Tom) Turn! Show your face!

321
00:24:20,419 --> 00:24:22,721
Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you!

322
00:24:23,689 --> 00:24:25,291
Grenade!

323
00:24:29,361 --> 00:24:31,831
(groans)

324
00:24:31,864 --> 00:24:34,100
(laughs)

325
00:24:34,133 --> 00:24:35,301
Fuck.

326
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:41,040
- You alright, mate?
- Oh, yeah, living the dream.

327
00:24:41,073 --> 00:24:42,775
Oh, shit.

328
00:24:49,982 --> 00:24:51,650
Oh, cheers, mate.

329
00:24:51,684 --> 00:24:53,886
Ooh. Your jacket's ruined.

330
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,690
What you gonna wear
for grouse hunting this year?

331
00:24:57,723 --> 00:24:59,225
Fuck off.

332
00:25:02,394 --> 00:25:04,864
You were supposed to use
nonlethal means.

333
00:25:04,897 --> 00:25:06,799
Didn't have a choice.

334
00:25:06,832 --> 00:25:10,336
He's right, boss. Target had
a grenade. Pulled the pin on us.

335
00:25:10,369 --> 00:25:13,105
Oh. Was that before or after
Tom shot her in the face?

336
00:25:13,139 --> 00:25:16,308
- Nasal spine, actually.
- Ha. Ha-ha-ha.

337
00:25:16,342 --> 00:25:18,344
And how do you expect me
to sell that up the food chain,

338
00:25:18,377 --> 00:25:19,945
let alone the <i>Guardian?</i>

339
00:25:19,979 --> 00:25:21,881
And she looked nothing
like Grace Lewis.

340
00:25:21,914 --> 00:25:23,883
- What?
- The woman. The one I shot.

341
00:25:23,916 --> 00:25:25,784
Nothing like her.

342
00:25:25,818 --> 00:25:28,154
We cordoned off the residence
an hour prior to the raid.

343
00:25:28,187 --> 00:25:30,022
(man) Everest 1
was drawing us in there.

344
00:25:30,055 --> 00:25:32,091
Giving Grace time to escape.

345
00:25:32,124 --> 00:25:34,860
OK, well,
I'll issue an all-ports warning.

346
00:25:34,894 --> 00:25:37,096
But this is why you're supposed
to use nonlethal means,

347
00:25:37,129 --> 00:25:39,365
so whoever it is
that we're looking for

348
00:25:39,398 --> 00:25:40,466
ends up on the floor in cuffs

349
00:25:40,499 --> 00:25:42,201
instead of on the floor dead!

350
00:25:42,234 --> 00:25:44,703
Grace isn't dead, boss.
They knew we were coming.

351
00:25:44,737 --> 00:25:47,473
The only question is how?

352
00:25:47,506 --> 00:25:50,442
Well, that's a question
for another day.

353
00:25:50,476 --> 00:25:52,244
You're stood down
till I fill out my report.

354
00:25:52,278 --> 00:25:54,980
Well, hang on, boss.
You weren't there.

355
00:25:55,014 --> 00:25:57,283
Order stands.
And get that sorted.

356
00:26:00,452 --> 00:26:02,188
Nasty, that.

357
00:26:06,425 --> 00:26:09,128
(SAS operator)
<i>That's Alpha now airborne. Out.</i>

358
00:26:13,532 --> 00:26:15,901
You alright, mate?

359
00:26:15,935 --> 00:26:17,369
Yeah.

360
00:26:17,403 --> 00:26:19,305
- That's balls, innit?
- What?

361
00:26:19,338 --> 00:26:22,174
- You getting stood down.
- Oh. It'll be alright.

362
00:26:23,108 --> 00:26:25,811
- You?
- Oh, yeah.

363
00:26:25,844 --> 00:26:27,346
Yeah, that blast is nothing

364
00:26:27,379 --> 00:26:30,115
compared to the damage
your couch has done to my back.

365
00:26:30,149 --> 00:26:32,851
You'll be happy to fuck off
at the end of the month, then.

366
00:26:32,885 --> 00:26:36,155
Eh? What, you and Soph
moving in together?

367
00:26:36,188 --> 00:26:38,090
More than that.

368
00:26:38,123 --> 00:26:41,293
Oh, Christ. Well, come on, then,
let's see it.

369
00:26:41,327 --> 00:26:42,995
- What?
- The ring.

370
00:26:43,028 --> 00:26:45,297
- It must rival Gibraltar.
- (laughs)

371
00:26:45,331 --> 00:26:49,435
Nah. It's just something
my nanna gave me.

372
00:26:49,468 --> 00:26:53,772
I'm sure Soph'll be
suitably impressed.

373
00:26:53,806 --> 00:26:56,308
She's quite sober
when it comes to money.

374
00:26:56,342 --> 00:26:57,843
Well, it's easy for you to say.

375
00:26:57,876 --> 00:26:59,478
My ex-missus
burned my bank statement.

376
00:26:59,511 --> 00:27:01,880
Dumped the ashes in my mouth.

377
00:27:01,914 --> 00:27:03,916
'Cause you paid for lap dances
with your credit card.

378
00:27:03,949 --> 00:27:06,218
Yeah, I was pissed, though,
wasn't I?

379
00:27:06,252 --> 00:27:07,453
Oh, man, you haven't got a clue

380
00:27:07,486 --> 00:27:09,388
what you're
getting yourself into.

381
00:27:09,421 --> 00:27:11,991
- No.
- You haven't, have you?

382
00:27:12,024 --> 00:27:13,559
(both laugh)

383
00:27:13,592 --> 00:27:15,361
It'll be alright.

384
00:27:15,394 --> 00:27:17,529
So, what,
you gonna leave the regiment?

385
00:27:17,563 --> 00:27:19,765
Of course not. It's home.

386
00:27:24,003 --> 00:27:25,838
Do you love her?

387
00:27:27,439 --> 00:27:29,275
Yeah.

388
00:27:29,308 --> 00:27:31,910
Mate, how long
have we known each other?

389
00:27:31,944 --> 00:27:33,846
Since basic. Why?

390
00:27:33,879 --> 00:27:36,915
In that whole time, I have never
ever known you to love anyone.

391
00:27:36,949 --> 00:27:40,786
- Well, this is different.
- Oh, yeah? How's that?

392
00:27:42,154 --> 00:27:44,356
Fuck off.

393
00:27:47,426 --> 00:27:50,262
Go on, boys, let's go.
In the van.

394
00:27:50,296 --> 00:27:51,997
(man) <i>The fact that

In Hereford.
Wouldn't wanna miss our flight.

402
00:28:08,047 --> 00:28:10,449
Well, I'm afraid
triage is not my area.

403
00:28:10,482 --> 00:28:12,151
Well, you've done a good job.

404
00:28:12,184 --> 00:28:14,053
Are you sure you don't want
anything for the pain?

405
00:28:14,086 --> 00:28:15,554
No.

00:28:29,636 --> 00:28:33,572
Shot her?
Yeah. Yeah, in the face.

413
00:28:36,175 --> 00:28:37,343
Are you upset?

414
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:41,113
She was in the fight.
It was me or her.

415
00:28:41,146 --> 00:28:43,882
Still, don't you
find it disturbing?

416
00:28:45,918 --> 00:28:47,453
No.

417
00:28:50,289 --> 00:28:52,491
I should know better by now.

418
00:28:54,093 --> 00:28:56,061
- What do you want me to say?
- I don't know, Tom.

419
00:28:56,095 --> 00:28:58,297
Does anything
ever affect you? Ever?

420
00:28:58,330 --> 00:28:59,565
No, never.

421
00:29:01,668 --> 00:29:03,369
Apart from you.

422
00:29:03,402 --> 00:29:05,904
I really wanna believe that
right now.

423
00:29:05,938 --> 00:29:07,406
Then do.

424
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:12,344
We're so different.

425
00:29:12,378 --> 00:29:14,313
Well, that's what
makes it work.

426
00:29:16,014 --> 00:29:19,351
Look, I love
being with you, Tom...

427
00:29:21,186 --> 00:29:24,323
but I don't understand you.

428
00:29:24,356 --> 00:29:27,226
Then let's talk about this.
In Paris.

429
00:29:28,994 --> 00:29:30,195
Hmm?

430
00:29:35,635 --> 00:29:38,504
Only if you're willing
to really talk.

431
00:29:38,537 --> 00:29:41,073
Absolutely.

432
00:29:41,106 --> 00:29:48,614
We will spend the entire time
in Paris in bed talking.

433
00:29:57,724 --> 00:30:02,060
There is something seriously
wrong with you, Tom Buckingham.

434
00:30:02,094 --> 00:30:04,631
You still have
your plane ticket?

435
00:30:04,664 --> 00:30:06,298
Nah, I binned it.

436
00:30:06,331 --> 00:30:08,167
Good. Change of plans.

437
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,169
I'm taking you
on the first train to Paris

438
00:30:10,202 --> 00:30:11,704
before you can bin me too.

439
00:30:11,738 --> 00:30:13,138
Tom.

In the fight?

462
00:32:22,234 --> 00:32:23,535
- You?
- Yeah.

463
00:32:23,569 --> 00:32:25,705

Tom, who is this woman?

468
00:33:37,677 --> 00:33:40,312
What woman?

469
00:33:40,345 --> 00:33:42,314
The one with her face plastered
all over the newspaper.

470
00:33:42,347 --> 00:33:45,283
- Yeah, didn't see that.
- It's hard to miss.

Easier than you think.

472
00:33:46,686 --> 00:33:49,789
Tom, what really happened
yesterday?

473
00:33:49,822 --> 00:33:54,226
'Cause you can tell me.
Tom, where are you going?

474
00:33:54,259 --> 00:33:56,796
To the gents. I won't be long.

487
00:35:52,511 --> 00:35:53,913
Morning, mate. How are you?

488
00:35:53,946 --> 00:35:55,915
I have Grace Lewis
on the Eurostream

489
00:35:55,948 --> 00:35:58,383
to Paris Gare du Nord.

490
00:35:58,416 --> 00:36:00,753
- Grace Lewis?
- Train's mobile.

491
00:36:00,787 --> 00:36:02,621
We're approaching
the Channel Tunnel.

492
00:36:02,655 --> 00:36:04,757
Hold on. What are you doing
on the Eurostream?

493
00:36:12,999 --> 00:36:17,302
Just wait till he's older.
Takes them ages to have a pee.

494
00:36:19,538 --> 00:36:22,809
If that was his only flaw,
I'd marry him tomorrow.

495
00:36:25,111 --> 00:36:27,647
Well, it's six o'clock
somewhere.

496
00:36:28,613 --> 00:36:30,049
Aren't you having one?

497
00:36:35,554 --> 00:36:36,989
Sure.

498
00:36:37,023 --> 00:36:39,491
A marriage proposal?

499
00:36:39,524 --> 00:36:41,593
One day after he dropped a woman
on Hampstead Heath?

500
00:36:41,626 --> 00:36:43,863
You know Tom. He's a romantic.

501
00:36:45,865 --> 00:36:48,500
Well, this time, before I do
anything, I need eyes on Grace.

502
00:36:48,533 --> 00:36:51,336
- Have Tom confirm it.
- Alright.

503
00:37:06,853 --> 00:37:08,855
(text alert)

504
00:37:14,694 --> 00:37:17,596
- Boss wants Grace confirmed.
- <i>We're almost in the tunnel.</i>

505
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:19,464
Right, then safest option,

506
00:37:19,497 --> 00:37:21,968
<i>just let the French
lift Grace at Gare du Nord.</i>

507
00:37:22,001 --> 00:37:25,972
- No, fuck it. I'll confirm her.
- Tom, wai...

508
00:37:47,026 --> 00:37:48,828
I've been married 53 years

509
00:37:48,861 --> 00:37:52,597
and I still don't understand
the old sweat.

510
00:37:52,632 --> 00:37:54,800
So it doesn't get
any better, then?

511
00:37:54,834 --> 00:37:56,769
Sorry?

512
00:38:00,172 --> 00:38:02,407
So it doesn't get
any better, then?

513
00:38:03,242 --> 00:38:06,444
- No, not really.
- Damn.

514
00:38:06,478 --> 00:38:09,048
I don't know.
We're just so different.

515
00:38:09,081 --> 00:38:10,816
In what way?

516
00:38:12,084 --> 00:38:14,787
He takes lives for a living.
I save them.

517
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:17,723
Oh, I see. Military man, is he?

518
00:38:18,824 --> 00:38:20,793
It has its uses, dear.

519
00:38:20,826 --> 00:38:23,595
Tom pretends it doesn't
affect him, but it must do.

520
00:38:23,629 --> 00:38:27,700
Well, not everyone
needs a shoulder to cry on.

521
00:38:27,733 --> 00:38:29,567
I'd be lucky if he even shrugged
his shoulders,

522
00:38:29,601 --> 00:38:30,870
<i>let alone shed a tear.</i>

523
00:38:30,903 --> 00:38:32,570
(woman) <i>And that's a problem,
is it?</i>

524
00:38:32,604 --> 00:38:34,472
(Sophie) <i>Well, yeah.</i>

525
00:38:34,506 --> 00:38:39,745
His crazy brain has a unique
ability to drive me crazy.

526
00:38:39,779 --> 00:38:44,050
A man running long in the loo
is not unique.

527
00:38:44,083 --> 00:38:46,819
God alone knows
what they do in there.

528
00:38:46,852 --> 00:38:49,188
Shall I tell you what he did
to my dead cat?

529
00:38:49,221 --> 00:38:52,158
- Your dead cat?
- Yeah.

530
00:38:52,191 --> 00:38:55,161
He found Chica in the garden,

531
00:38:55,194 --> 00:38:58,130
brought her in my flat
draped over his arm

532
00:38:58,164 --> 00:39:00,066
in full rigor mortis.

533
00:39:00,099 --> 00:39:01,634
Oh, I see.

534
00:39:01,667 --> 00:39:02,768
He then proceeded to suggest

535
00:39:02,802 --> 00:39:04,737
we put her in the freezer

536
00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:06,205
until we got back from holiday.

537
00:39:06,238 --> 00:39:09,541
- Oh, right.
- I refused, of course.

538
00:39:09,574 --> 00:39:12,645
We canceled our holiday
and gave her a proper burial.

539
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,829
- (bleeping)
- Cover.

540
00:39:32,765 --> 00:39:35,267
(driver)
This is a red trigger...

541
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:43,142
Oh!

542
00:39:48,948 --> 00:39:50,783
(alarm blares)

543
00:39:52,251 --> 00:39:54,954
Clear the tunnel and dispatch
the fire response team.

544
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:06,298
(sirens wail)

545
00:40:26,618 --> 00:40:28,721
Getting eyes
on the flash points now.

546
00:40:29,155 --> 00:40:30,289
(bleeps)

547
00:40:35,161 --> 00:40:36,962
(alarm blares)

548
00:41:20,005 --> 00:41:21,974
(sirens wail)

549
00:41:28,247 --> 00:41:30,216
Wow. Really?

550
00:41:30,249 --> 00:41:33,119
Yeah. Well,
it looked way better on him.

551
00:41:33,152 --> 00:41:37,089
- And the kit?
- Relax. I got you.

552
00:41:42,728 --> 00:41:44,997
You're only as good
as your worst day, huh?

553
00:41:52,338 --> 00:41:57,376
(Olly) OK, listen in.
Remember, short, sharp commands.

554
00:41:57,409 --> 00:42:00,379
We need
to take control immediately.

555
00:42:00,412 --> 00:42:05,684
If anyone disobeys, ignores,
doesn't understand, tough shit.

556
00:42:05,718 --> 00:42:08,454
You will make
an example of them.

557
00:42:08,487 --> 00:42:12,158
We need to grip that train
from the get-go. You understand?

558
00:42:12,191 --> 00:42:14,093
(Black Swan) Remember,
all keep switched on.

559
00:42:14,126 --> 00:42:17,429
Everyone, fingers out your
arses. We need to move in two.

560
00:42:18,931 --> 00:42:20,366
Breach! Breach!

561
00:42:20,399 --> 00:42:22,401
- (Olly) On me.
- (Black Swan) Come on, go!

562
00:42:25,337 --> 00:42:26,872
(Black Swan) Cover me.

563
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:41,453
- Who the fuck was that?
- Don't know. But he's trained.

564
00:42:43,355 --> 00:42:45,224
Everybody back.

565
00:42:45,257 --> 00:42:46,825
(bleeping)

566
00:42:56,001 --> 00:42:58,103
(screaming)

567
00:43:10,015 --> 00:43:12,985
Oh, my God. What's happened? Oh.

568
00:43:19,291 --> 00:43:22,861
Oh, I've got...
I've got some glass in my leg.

569
00:43:22,895 --> 00:43:25,397
OK. Don't worry,
I'll get it out.

570
00:43:25,431 --> 00:43:26,999
Oh, fuck.

571
00:43:28,801 --> 00:43:30,302
(ringing tone)

572
00:43:31,870 --> 00:43:34,039
- OK.
- (text alert)

573
00:43:34,073 --> 00:43:37,009
Just keep still.
It's gonna be alright.

574
00:43:38,911 --> 00:43:41,180
<i>This is Dr. Hart.
Please leave a message.</i>

575
00:43:41,213 --> 00:43:44,450
Stay in your seat.
I'm coming for you.

576
00:43:44,483 --> 00:43:47,019
There's a player
in the battle space.

577
00:43:47,052 --> 00:43:48,854
He's armed and skilled.

578
00:43:48,887 --> 00:43:51,323
Check the tunnel, check the
train, check the passengers,

579
00:43:51,357 --> 00:43:53,225
and do not let him get away.

580
00:43:53,259 --> 00:43:56,262
- (woman) Roger. We're on it.
- (Olly) Everyone spread out.

581
00:43:56,295 --> 00:43:58,130
Alright.

582
00:43:58,163 --> 00:44:01,300
This'll stop the bleeding.
It's gonna be alright.

583
00:44:03,135 --> 00:44:05,938
(man) <i>Assieds-toi. Reste ici.
Les filles, non, vous asseyez.</i>

584
00:44:05,971 --> 00:44:07,172
<i>Asseyez-vous.</i>

585
00:44:08,507 --> 00:44:11,877
Everybody sit down!
Don't you fucking move!

586
00:44:15,214 --> 00:44:18,484
Heads down! You, eyes down now!

587
00:44:18,517 --> 00:44:20,386
Stay down!

588
00:44:20,419 --> 00:44:22,354
(gunshot)

589
00:44:22,388 --> 00:44:24,523
Down! Move!

590
00:44:26,992 --> 00:44:28,394
(screaming)

591
00:44:28,427 --> 00:44:31,263
If you want to live,
shut the fuck up.

592
00:44:31,297 --> 00:44:33,332
Don't move! Stay where you are!

593
00:44:33,365 --> 00:44:36,835
Everyone remain calm.
Get back in your seats.

594
00:44:36,869 --> 00:44:39,138
Keep your hands
above your heads.

595
00:44:41,106 --> 00:44:45,577
I said get the fuck
back to your seat.

596
00:44:45,611 --> 00:44:46,945
(gunshot)

597
00:44:46,979 --> 00:44:48,814
(screaming)

598
00:44:50,249 --> 00:44:52,551
Listen in.

599
00:44:52,584 --> 00:44:56,188
Do what you're told
when you're told,

600
00:44:56,221 --> 00:44:57,956
and that...

601
00:44:59,091 --> 00:45:01,460
Sit the fuck down!

602
00:45:03,663 --> 00:45:06,098
And that will not happen to you.

603
00:45:12,137 --> 00:45:13,605
(Black Swan) Heads down.

604
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:15,574
(man) I just need
to get her inhaler. Please...

605
00:45:15,607 --> 00:45:17,343
Get back in your fucking seat.

606
00:45:17,376 --> 00:45:20,946
- (Olly) I need you outside.
- Yeah, alright, now.

607
00:45:26,985 --> 00:45:28,487
(phone rings)

608
00:45:30,657 --> 00:45:33,158
- Give us what you got, mate.
- (Tom) <i>Grace confirmed.</i>

609
00:45:33,192 --> 00:45:34,426
<i>I don't know what it means yet,</i>

610
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:36,328
but it's not an escape,
it's an attack.

611
00:45:36,362 --> 00:45:38,030
<i>She's got support down here.</i>

612
00:45:38,063 --> 00:45:40,332
<i>About two dozen Swans,
all armed.</i>

613
00:45:40,366 --> 00:45:42,334
<i>Stand to the team.</i>

614
00:45:42,368 --> 00:45:44,269
<i>(screaming)</i>

615
00:45:44,303 --> 00:45:46,905
You gonna come out and meet us
at the point of entry, yeah?

616
00:45:46,939 --> 00:45:49,007
I have to find Sophie.

617
00:45:49,041 --> 00:45:50,542
Too many Swans, mate.
They'll smash you.

618
00:45:50,576 --> 00:45:52,144
Just wait till we get there.

619
00:45:52,177 --> 00:45:54,313
No time.
Text me when you're on site.

620
00:45:54,346 --> 00:45:56,548
<i>I'm gonna run a CTR.</i>

621
00:46:02,054 --> 00:46:04,623
If you attempt to disembark,
you'll be shot and killed,

622
00:46:04,657 --> 00:46:07,326
so please stay on the train.

623
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:10,396
Do what you're told
when you're told.

624
00:46:10,429 --> 00:46:13,132
(Black Swan) Get fucking down.
Just sit down!

625
00:46:15,367 --> 00:46:19,338
Get down now! Be fucking quiet!

626
00:46:19,371 --> 00:46:22,374
If you can see my eyes,
I can see yours!

627
00:46:22,408 --> 00:46:25,043
Look at the fucking ground!

628
00:46:28,013 --> 00:46:29,682
Shit.

629
00:46:29,716 --> 00:46:35,320
(Black Swan) Everyone stay down,
stay calm, do not fucking move,

630
00:46:35,354 --> 00:46:37,956
take deep breaths,

631
00:46:37,990 --> 00:46:39,558
and all will be fine.

632
00:46:39,591 --> 00:46:42,629
Don't fuck about.
Don't make me shoot you.

633
00:46:42,662 --> 00:46:45,063
Stay fucking calm.

634
00:46:57,309 --> 00:46:59,211
(commander) <i>I don't care
what Tom wants.</i>

635
00:46:59,244 --> 00:47:01,513
Tell him to withdraw
from the tunnel.

636
00:47:04,016 --> 00:47:07,286
Well, he's already
on a close target recce. Look.

637
00:47:09,656 --> 00:47:13,660
Tom is putting innocent lives
in danger. Get him out.

638
00:47:13,693 --> 00:47:15,294
And forward me those photos.

639
00:47:15,327 --> 00:47:17,095
I need to run 'em
up the food chain.

640
00:47:17,129 --> 00:47:20,232
The PM has asked
for all the latest intelligence.

641
00:47:20,265 --> 00:47:22,134
There you go. Sent.

642
00:47:37,549 --> 00:47:39,652
Service tunnel secure,
and UK-bound tunnel blocked

643
00:47:39,686 --> 00:47:41,420
<i>by fire and thick smoke.</i>

644
00:47:41,453 --> 00:47:43,121
(Grace) <i>Roger that.
Start the drilling.</i>

645
00:47:43,155 --> 00:47:45,157
<i>Get me a sitrep in five.</i>

646
00:47:45,190 --> 00:47:48,126
<i>I want the player found
and dropped now.</i>

647
00:48:02,809 --> 00:48:06,144
(pilot) <i>Papa 1-4. All my
call signs ready to load.</i>

648
00:48:07,412 --> 00:48:09,581
(pilot 2) <i>Papa 1-6. Confirmed.</i>

649
00:48:12,618 --> 00:48:15,755
(commander) <i>Alpha. All red

651
00:48:21,393 --> 00:48:23,262
Guns are set.

652
00:48:24,329 --> 00:48:26,598
Player's running a CTR.

653
00:48:31,236 --> 00:48:33,505
(Olly) He's looking for holes
in your protection bubble.

654
00:48:33,539 --> 00:48:36,341
And a way into the carriages.

655
00:48:36,375 --> 00:48:38,645
Especially seven,
eight and nine.

656
00:48:39,746 --> 00:48:41,681
Good work.

657
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:09,474
Find the player.

658
00:49:09,508 --> 00:49:11,878
Confiscate every phone from
every passenger in every coach.

659
00:49:11,911 --> 00:49:14,747
If someone refuses, shoot them.

660
00:49:27,225 --> 00:49:29,796
Please hand over
any electronic devices.

661
00:49:29,829 --> 00:49:31,563
(man) There you are.

662
00:49:37,670 --> 00:49:39,104
In your own time, sir.

663
00:49:44,844 --> 00:49:46,545
In your own time, gentlemen.

664
00:49:51,550 --> 00:49:53,218
Thank you.

665
00:50:01,426 --> 00:50:02,862
Really?

666
00:50:02,895 --> 00:50:06,331
- What?
- What, are you 12?

667
00:50:06,365 --> 00:50:09,167
Am I gonna get it back?
It cost me 500 quid.

668
00:50:14,573 --> 00:50:16,341
And I'm the criminal.

669
00:50:22,381 --> 00:50:24,282
(newsreader) <i>Some major
breaking news to bring you.</i>

670
00:50:24,316 --> 00:50:27,654
<i>Multiple sources are telling us
that a Eurostream train</i>

671
00:50:27,687 --> 00:50:29,722
has been hijacked.

672
00:50:29,756 --> 00:50:32,290
We have very few details so far.

673
00:50:32,324 --> 00:50:33,826
What we do know
is that the train

674
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:35,795
was heading
for Paris Gare du Nord

675
00:50:35,828 --> 00:50:38,698
when it was commandeered
in the Channel Tunnel.

676
00:50:38,731 --> 00:50:40,900
There's no word
on who's behind it

677
00:50:40,933 --> 00:50:42,835
or what their motives might be,

678
00:50:42,869 --> 00:50:44,436
<i>but if confirmed, this would be</i>

679
00:50:44,469 --> 00:50:47,539
<i>a major incident
on British soil.</i>

680
00:50:47,572 --> 00:50:49,441
Why is she still breathing?

681
00:50:49,474 --> 00:50:52,277
I zapped Lewis at Hampstead
Heath, but Grace weren't in.

682
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:55,480
- But how did she manage that?
- Someone might have warned her.

683
00:50:55,514 --> 00:50:58,951
- Someone?
- I'll find him.

684
00:50:58,985 --> 00:51:01,854
- Sky News has it.
- Do they have Grace?

685
00:51:01,888 --> 00:51:03,823
Not yet. Still speculating.

686
00:51:03,856 --> 00:51:05,825
Right. I'm convening Cobra.

687
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:09,762
If she exposes what we've done,

688
00:51:09,796 --> 00:51:11,296
this is not
just a problem for you,

689
00:51:11,329 --> 00:51:13,265
this is a very big problem
for me.

690
00:51:13,298 --> 00:51:16,736
The Eurostream has stopped on
British soil, so it's your call.

691
00:51:16,769 --> 00:51:18,537
Do I have control?

692
00:51:18,570 --> 00:51:21,440
Yes. Get down there
and kill her.

693
00:51:24,409 --> 00:51:27,847
Listen up! I need everyone's
phones out. Phones out.

694
00:51:32,484 --> 00:51:35,722
- Where's your phone?
- I do not have one.

695
00:51:35,755 --> 00:51:37,657
I lost it during the explosion.

696
00:51:37,690 --> 00:51:39,424
Shame.

697
00:51:39,458 --> 00:51:40,760
- (gunshot)
- (screaming)

698
00:51:40,793 --> 00:51:42,995
(whimpers)

699
00:51:47,299 --> 00:51:50,268
Anyone have any medical training
on this train, huh?

700
00:51:51,436 --> 00:51:52,739
Can you get a doctor?

701
00:51:57,777 --> 00:52:01,446
(pilot) <i>Papa 1-4. On final
approach to the tunnel.</i>

702
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:15,728
I'm a doctor.

703
00:52:30,475 --> 00:52:33,612
Can you fix, uh, it?

704
00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:38,483
(whimpers)

705
00:52:38,517 --> 00:52:41,520
If I can get a trauma kit and
some running water, then yeah.

706
00:52:43,622 --> 00:52:47,425
I'm gonna take care of you,
OK? Come on. It's alright.

707
00:52:47,459 --> 00:52:50,830
Come on. It's gonna be OK.

708
00:53:09,816 --> 00:53:11,017
Stay close.

709
00:53:12,952 --> 00:53:16,656
Red 2. UK-bound tunnel
compromised by fire and smoke.

710
00:53:16,689 --> 00:53:19,424
French tunnel compromised
by up to 24 Black Swans.

711
00:53:19,457 --> 00:53:22,795
All red call signs will proceed
via central service tunnel.

712
00:53:22,829 --> 00:53:26,364
(pilot) <i>Papa 1-5.
Final approach now.</i>

713
00:53:26,398 --> 00:53:29,735
(pilot 2) <i>Papa 1-6. Holding.</i>

714
00:53:29,769 --> 00:53:31,804
(commander)
<i>All call signs, this is Alpha.</i>

715
00:53:31,838 --> 00:53:33,438
<i>Hold at the tunnel entrance.</i>

716
00:53:33,471 --> 00:53:35,975
(pilot 2) <i>Red 1-6.
Roger that. Out.</i>

717
00:53:46,953 --> 00:53:48,386
It's OK, it's OK.

718
00:53:50,690 --> 00:53:52,424
Stay there.

719
00:53:58,097 --> 00:54:00,565
Can we have
some privacy, please?

720
00:54:07,606 --> 00:54:10,676
Red 2. Fire door, 20 meters out.

721
00:54:12,178 --> 00:54:13,612
Everyone.

722
00:54:38,603 --> 00:54:40,673
Red 3. Fire door is obstructed.

723
00:54:40,706 --> 00:54:42,942
Needs explosive entry
and that will compromise us.

724
00:54:42,975 --> 00:54:45,778
All call signs
set up a control point.

725
00:54:48,247 --> 00:54:50,816
(girl whimpers)

726
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:55,520
OK.

727
00:55:03,162 --> 00:55:05,497
- Any word from Tom?
- I'm waiting on a call back.

728
00:55:05,530 --> 00:55:07,934
- Olivia, up yet?
- No, nothing, sir.

729
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:17,877
Right, listen in.
Stand to the emergency response.

730
00:55:17,910 --> 00:55:19,712
- I want the team in now.
- We've just set up.

731
00:55:19,745 --> 00:55:21,613
So's Grace.

732
00:55:21,647 --> 00:55:24,050
- We're completely in the blind.
- Get some fucking glasses.

733
00:55:24,083 --> 00:55:26,886
- They zapped the CCTV, sir.
- We need people on the ground.

734
00:55:26,919 --> 00:55:28,688
We need to carry out
a proper CTR.

735
00:55:28,721 --> 00:55:30,756
- Well, who took these, then?
- Tom.

736
00:55:30,790 --> 00:55:32,692
Tom?

737
00:55:32,725 --> 00:55:34,894
Buckingham.

738
00:55:34,927 --> 00:55:37,096
Was he the bloke that zapped
that woman on Hampstead Heath?

739
00:55:37,129 --> 00:55:40,532
- Yeah.
- Good skills for a posh twat.

740
00:55:40,565 --> 00:55:42,969
So, hold on a minute.
How come he's inside the cordon?

741
00:55:43,002 --> 00:55:47,106
He was taking his girlfriend
to Paris to propose.

742
00:55:47,139 --> 00:55:49,075
Well, the Swans have done him
a fucking favor, then.

743
00:55:49,108 --> 00:55:51,509
OK, back to what we're here for.
These photos are not enough.

744
00:55:51,543 --> 00:55:53,611
Well, they are today,
'cause Grace is the target.

745
00:55:53,646 --> 00:55:54,814
We have no idea where she is.

746
00:55:54,847 --> 00:55:56,248
The moment you make contact,

747
00:55:56,282 --> 00:55:58,616
Grace will close in
and she will fight.

748
00:55:58,651 --> 00:56:00,019
But today
she's got nowhere to go.

749
00:56:00,052 --> 00:56:01,821
My job is to rescue hostages.

750
00:56:01,854 --> 00:56:03,990
Not today. Hit that train now.

751
00:56:04,023 --> 00:56:05,758
If we do that,
we will take casualties.

752
00:56:05,791 --> 00:56:07,827
Just give me a moment
to plan a deliberate option...

753
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:10,595
What are you, the head
of a fucking knitting circle?

754
00:56:10,629 --> 00:56:12,698
The Swans are split up,
two to a carriage.

755
00:56:12,732 --> 00:56:14,734
- Now's the time to attack.
- I don't agree with you.

756
00:56:14,767 --> 00:56:17,069
Well, you can disagree
all you fucking like, mate,

757
00:56:17,103 --> 00:56:18,771
but this is what's gonna happen.

758
00:56:18,804 --> 00:56:20,538
You are gonna act
like a professional soldier.

759
00:56:20,572 --> 00:56:22,875
You are gonna initiate
emergency response.

760
00:56:22,908 --> 00:56:24,609
And you are gonna kill Grace.

761
00:56:24,643 --> 00:56:29,682
And if you don't,
you are off and he is on.

762
00:56:29,715 --> 00:56:31,283
Do you understand?

763
00:56:42,928 --> 00:56:45,131
Oh, fucking hell.

764
00:56:52,204 --> 00:56:53,906
(text alert)

765
00:57:04,984 --> 00:57:06,218
Shit.

766
00:57:06,252 --> 00:57:08,120
Not right now,
if you don't mind.

767
00:57:10,256 --> 00:57:11,824
Here.

768
00:57:11,857 --> 00:57:14,226
Unscrew the toilet
and I'll get you down.

769
00:57:14,260 --> 00:57:15,861
No.

770
00:57:16,896 --> 00:57:20,232
No? What do you mean, no?

771
00:57:20,266 --> 00:57:21,934
I need to stay here
and help the wounded.

772
00:57:21,967 --> 00:57:23,903
Soph, the team
are about to hit this train,

773
00:57:23,936 --> 00:57:26,205
and when they do, there are
gonna be a lot more casualties.

774
00:57:26,238 --> 00:57:27,673
You're not gonna be one of them.

775
00:57:27,706 --> 00:57:29,008
Sorry.

776
00:57:29,041 --> 00:57:30,976
I'm staying here.

777
00:57:33,012 --> 00:57:35,948
I have a wounded girl here.
Save her instead.

778
00:57:35,981 --> 00:57:37,349
If you stay on this train,
you will die.

779
00:57:37,383 --> 00:57:39,085
- I am not leaving.
- Soph...

780
00:57:39,118 --> 00:57:41,821
I am not leaving.

781
00:57:48,727 --> 00:57:49,995
Roger that.

782
00:57:50,930 --> 00:57:52,231
Red 2. Moving now.

783
00:57:52,264 --> 00:57:55,234
(commander)
<i>Alpha. Good luck. Out.</i>

784
00:58:35,741 --> 00:58:39,845
Sierra 1.
Rear locomotive unmanned.

785
00:58:41,147 --> 00:58:43,215
Roger that. Proceed.

786
00:58:55,928 --> 00:58:57,863
(Black Swan)
What's going on in there?

787
00:58:57,897 --> 00:58:59,732
OK, come on. Quickly. Quickly.

788
00:58:59,765 --> 00:59:00,432
(Black Swan) Oi.

789
00:59:00,466 --> 00:59:01,734
(knocking)

790
00:59:01,767 --> 00:59:03,169
What's going on?

791
00:59:03,202 --> 00:59:05,738
That's it. There you go.

792
00:59:05,771 --> 00:59:08,007
- (Black Swan) Open the door.
- Jesus Christ, Tom.

793
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:10,042
- (Black Swan) Open the door.
- What?

794
00:59:10,075 --> 00:59:11,810
You'd make a great father.

795
00:59:11,844 --> 00:59:14,180
- Well, it worked, didn't it?
- (Black Swan) Oi!

796
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:24,757
- (Black Swan) Open the door!
- Knock me out.

797
00:59:24,790 --> 00:59:26,192
- What?
- I said open the fucking door!

798
00:59:26,225 --> 00:59:29,495
So it doesn't look like
I helped you.

799
00:59:29,528 --> 00:59:32,198
(Black Swan) Open this door now.

800
00:59:32,231 --> 00:59:34,099
It's a good idea.

801
00:59:34,133 --> 00:59:36,335
(Black Swan) The kid escaped.

802
00:59:40,206 --> 00:59:42,308
Up top! Contact!

803
00:59:49,348 --> 00:59:51,517
(commander) <i>This is Alpha.
Withdraw now.</i>

804
00:59:51,550 --> 00:59:54,353
Bin it! Bin it! Bin it!

805
00:59:57,356 --> 00:59:59,992
Coach 9. Converge. Converge!

806
01:00:00,025 --> 01:00:01,927
(in French)

807
01:00:04,330 --> 01:00:06,131
Move!

808
01:00:07,233 --> 01:00:08,767
Stop!

809
01:00:10,202 --> 01:00:11,904
Fuck.

810
01:00:13,405 --> 01:00:15,174
(gunfire continues)

811
01:00:15,207 --> 01:00:17,343
Shit.

812
01:00:25,084 --> 01:00:26,785
Move!

813
01:00:29,955 --> 01:00:31,323
Move. Move!

814
01:00:47,606 --> 01:00:49,308
Shit.

815
01:00:50,909 --> 01:00:52,344
Move!

816
01:00:58,951 --> 01:01:00,819
What happened here?

817
01:01:00,853 --> 01:01:04,156
The player breached in, smashed
the doctor, lifted the kid.

818
01:01:04,189 --> 01:01:06,959
He's more effective
than the SAS.

819
01:01:08,394 --> 01:01:11,163
I pushed them back
to the control point.

820
01:01:11,196 --> 01:01:13,999
Yeah, because my source told us
that they were coming.

821
01:01:14,033 --> 01:01:15,901
- Your fucking snide?
- He's our fucking snide.

822
01:01:15,934 --> 01:01:17,836
And he's a critical part
of this operation.

823
01:01:17,870 --> 01:01:21,173
Yeah, well, someone still
had to pull the trigger.

824
01:01:21,206 --> 01:01:23,575
And it's a really good skill.

825
01:01:23,609 --> 01:01:26,378
Now use it to find
the kid and the player.

826
01:01:26,412 --> 01:01:28,514
They were last seen down there.

827
01:01:31,050 --> 01:01:33,385
(Black Swan)
You're all doing a good job.

828
01:01:33,419 --> 01:01:35,321
Stay just like that

829
01:01:35,354 --> 01:01:38,357
and not long from now
you'll be safe at home

830
01:01:38,390 --> 01:01:41,327
selling your story
to the papers.

831
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:43,562
Be famous, not dead.

832
01:01:46,131 --> 01:01:48,000
(girl gasps)

833
01:01:59,978 --> 01:02:02,414
- (man) That was a gang fuck.
- (commander) Who's down?

834
01:02:02,448 --> 01:02:04,950
- (man) It was Rich and Pat.
- (commander) Shit.

835
01:02:09,455 --> 01:02:11,557
So where is she?

836
01:02:11,590 --> 01:02:13,292
Is that really
your major concern right now?

837
01:02:13,325 --> 01:02:15,627
No, my major concern
is that you fucked it up.

838
01:02:15,662 --> 01:02:17,296
I told you it was too soon.

839
01:02:17,329 --> 01:02:19,131
And I told you
I wanted Grace dead.

840
01:02:19,164 --> 01:02:22,067
- So where is she?
- She knew we were coming.

841
01:02:24,269 --> 01:02:26,505
- How?
- I don't know.

842
01:02:26,538 --> 01:02:29,241
The Swans weren't split up
two per carriage.

843
01:02:29,274 --> 01:02:31,610
They were on the roof of
the train, waiting to smash us.

844
01:02:31,644 --> 01:02:34,213
He's right, it was a trap.

845
01:03:28,635 --> 01:03:30,302
(computer chimes)

846
01:03:31,671 --> 01:03:34,006
Who installed Skype
on an internal system?

847
01:03:34,039 --> 01:03:39,178
This came in via our intranet.
Should I... Should I answer it?

848
01:03:40,245 --> 01:03:41,648
Yeah, go on.

849
01:03:41,681 --> 01:03:46,051
<i>I wanna speak
to the ground commander.</i>

850
01:03:46,084 --> 01:03:48,053
Major Bisset.
Special Air Service.

851
01:03:48,086 --> 01:03:49,555
I'm here to negotiate
a peaceful resolution.

852
01:03:49,588 --> 01:03:51,190
<i>Thanks to
your assault yesterday,</i>

853
01:03:51,223 --> 01:03:52,391
<i>we're left
with only two options.</i>

854
01:03:52,424 --> 01:03:54,059
Which are?

855
01:03:54,092 --> 01:03:55,527
<i>The prime minister
can go on live TV</i>

856
01:03:55,561 --> 01:03:57,196
<i>and admit that
the British government</i>

857
01:03:57,229 --> 01:03:59,198
<i>ordered that clearing op
in Georgia.</i>

858
01:03:59,231 --> 01:04:01,066
<i>Or he can outfit that
Eurocopter you flew in</i>

859
01:04:01,099 --> 01:04:02,234
<i>with extra fuel bladders</i>

860
01:04:02,267 --> 01:04:03,535
<i>and wire 500 million</i>

861
01:04:03,569 --> 01:04:05,705
<i>to an account
of my designation.</i>

862
01:04:05,738 --> 01:04:07,306
That's a lot of money
to organize.

863
01:04:07,339 --> 01:04:09,208
<i>Britgaz can manage it.</i>

864
01:04:09,241 --> 01:04:11,744
- Why would they pay for it?
- <i>They hired us to do the job.</i>

865
01:04:11,778 --> 01:04:14,613
<i>Well, actually,
they hired the SAS to hire us.</i>

866
01:04:14,647 --> 01:04:17,216
<i>But those details are best left
for the war crimes tribunal.</i>

867
01:04:17,249 --> 01:04:19,351
<i>In the event
we don't get that ransom.</i>

868
01:04:19,384 --> 01:04:21,286
That's really not my concern.

869
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:23,555
- My only job is to protect...
- <i>Protect British interests.</i>

870
01:04:23,589 --> 01:04:26,726
<i>Both military and economic.
Ask Clements.</i>

871
01:04:26,759 --> 01:04:30,195
<i>I'm sure he's lurking
around your control point.</i>

872
01:04:32,598 --> 01:04:33,733
(sighs)

873
01:04:35,334 --> 01:04:37,135
I want
a hundred hostages released

874
01:04:37,169 --> 01:04:38,470
as a show of good faith.

875
01:04:38,504 --> 01:04:40,305
<i>Agreed.</i>

876
01:04:40,339 --> 01:04:43,676
<i>But you'll have to come
and get them yourself.</i>

877
01:04:43,710 --> 01:04:45,577
<i>And bring Clements.</i>

878
01:04:52,719 --> 01:04:55,120
What you fucking looking at?

879
01:04:57,089 --> 01:04:59,659
(in French)

880
01:06:11,798 --> 01:06:13,766
You know she only wants you
in there so she can kill you?

881
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:15,167
Yeah.

882
01:06:17,502 --> 01:06:21,540
And the only reason I'm going
in there is to kill her first.

883
01:06:21,573 --> 01:06:22,775
Oh, really?

884
01:06:24,343 --> 01:06:25,510
How you gonna do that?

885
01:06:26,779 --> 01:06:28,547
Find out when we get there.

886
01:06:28,580 --> 01:06:30,750
(Black Swan) <i>This is 1-4.
I have a weeper.</i>

887
01:06:30,783 --> 01:06:32,351
<i>He's hyperventilating.</i>

888
01:06:32,384 --> 01:06:34,854
<i>Crying, begging,
starting to lose it.</i>

889
01:06:34,887 --> 01:06:39,558
<i>I need someone to me now
to lift him and isolate him...</i>

890
01:06:39,591 --> 01:06:41,593
(in French)

891
01:07:20,633 --> 01:07:21,801
<i>Viens.</i>

892
01:07:34,613 --> 01:07:36,348
<i>Viens, viens.</i>

893
01:07:36,381 --> 01:07:39,217
All call signs.
Rear cockpit. Go!

894
01:07:39,251 --> 01:07:42,320
The player's
in the rear cockpit. Go, go, go!

895
01:07:54,834 --> 01:07:56,736
(yells)

896
01:08:01,641 --> 01:08:03,542
Fuck.

897
01:08:11,684 --> 01:08:13,485
Where's the player?

898
01:08:13,518 --> 01:08:15,755
He saved the girl.

899
01:08:17,056 --> 01:08:19,391
But stayed in the fight.

900
01:08:21,728 --> 01:08:23,996
- There you are.
- <i>Merci, monsieur.</i>

901
01:08:24,030 --> 01:08:26,298
If this little fucker
can push through their defenses,

902
01:08:26,331 --> 01:08:27,466
then so can we.

903
01:08:27,499 --> 01:08:29,367
So let's crack on.

904
01:08:29,401 --> 01:08:30,703
Dec.

905
01:08:31,671 --> 01:08:33,338
We're gonna get these hostages.

906
01:08:33,371 --> 01:08:35,742
You're in command
till I get back.

907
01:08:37,877 --> 01:08:41,613
Why'd you help that man
break inside the train?

908
01:08:41,647 --> 01:08:43,716
I didn't. I was helping
the little girl like you asked,

909
01:08:43,750 --> 01:08:45,952
and then a man
unscrewed the toilet.

910
01:08:46,652 --> 01:08:47,854
Hmm.

911
01:08:50,823 --> 01:08:53,592
Are you his wife?

912
01:08:53,625 --> 01:08:55,762
I'm not married.

913
01:09:02,034 --> 01:09:03,636
You're lying.

914
01:09:03,669 --> 01:09:06,672
Look what he did to my face.

915
01:09:06,706 --> 01:09:10,609
This isn't her phone.
Just FYI.

916
01:09:14,046 --> 01:09:16,916
Where is your real phone, hmm?

917
01:09:16,949 --> 01:09:18,885
Lover boy call it
to arrange your escape?

918
01:09:18,918 --> 01:09:21,053
I didn't try to escape.

919
01:09:22,521 --> 01:09:24,924
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

920
01:09:27,860 --> 01:09:30,029
Take her to the toilet
and find her real phone.

921
01:09:30,062 --> 01:09:31,931
And stay professional.

922
01:10:36,829 --> 01:10:39,932
Stay professional.

923
01:10:39,966 --> 01:10:42,400
Have you found
her real phone yet?

924
01:10:42,902 --> 01:10:44,036
Not yet.

925
01:10:54,579 --> 01:10:55,915
(drilling)

926
01:11:28,180 --> 01:11:29,982
(Grace)
<i>If I didn't know any better,</i>

927
01:11:30,016 --> 01:11:31,117
<i>I'd think you were the player.</i>

928
01:11:31,150 --> 01:11:33,518
I'll take that as a compliment.

929
01:11:35,087 --> 01:11:37,455
How long have you been dating?

930
01:11:38,057 --> 01:11:40,960
Never met him.

931
01:11:40,993 --> 01:11:42,728
But if you could be kind enough
to introduce us,

932
01:11:42,762 --> 01:11:45,097
I'd love
to take him out for dinner.

933
01:11:45,131 --> 01:11:48,466
<i>He's starting
to sound like my type.</i>

934
01:12:08,888 --> 01:12:10,122
<i>(drilling)</i>

935
01:12:11,523 --> 01:12:12,792
<i>(drilling stops)</i>

936
01:12:22,802 --> 01:12:24,804
Is it through?

937
01:12:28,774 --> 01:12:30,843
It looks like
we have the clearance.

938
01:12:32,610 --> 01:12:34,981
Find Grace
and tell her we're through.

939
01:12:35,014 --> 01:12:37,183
I'll get started on the device.

940
01:12:37,216 --> 01:12:38,884
(Black Swan) Roger that.

941
01:12:52,597 --> 01:12:54,100
Cute.

942
01:12:54,133 --> 01:12:57,236
- Found your phone.
- Fuck.

943
01:13:20,126 --> 01:13:21,694
Careful.

944
01:13:56,162 --> 01:13:57,863
Hello, Grace.

945
01:14:16,849 --> 01:14:19,085
Can I offer you a drink?

946
01:14:19,118 --> 01:14:23,022
Ooh, yeah, I'll have...
I'll have a glass of champagne.

947
01:15:06,031 --> 01:15:08,734
- So where are the hostages?
- Hmm?

948
01:15:08,767 --> 01:15:10,369
Oh, they're not going anywhere.

949
01:15:10,402 --> 01:15:12,671
So why are we here?

950
01:15:20,012 --> 01:15:23,315
You probably thought
that was gonna be you.

951
01:15:23,349 --> 01:15:26,252
Actually, I thought
it was gonna be you.

952
01:15:26,285 --> 01:15:28,220
I know that's what
you're here for.

953
01:15:28,254 --> 01:15:32,091
So, let's try this again,
shall we?

954
01:15:32,124 --> 01:15:35,027
- Grace Lewis.
- George Clements.

955
01:15:38,464 --> 01:15:42,234
Calm down.
We have a lot to discuss.

956
01:15:43,302 --> 01:15:44,770
No, we don't.

957
01:15:44,803 --> 01:15:47,039
You hired us to do a job.

958
01:15:47,072 --> 01:15:48,874
Yeah, you didn't do it properly.

959
01:15:48,908 --> 01:15:51,377
You said clear the village,
and we did.

960
01:15:51,410 --> 01:15:53,812
You fucked up.
You left witnesses.

961
01:15:53,846 --> 01:15:57,316
They were supposed
to spread the fear.

962
01:15:57,349 --> 01:15:59,818
They spread the fear alright.

963
01:15:59,852 --> 01:16:01,453
Did it work?

964
01:16:01,487 --> 01:16:03,322
Did any other village
ever refuse

965
01:16:03,355 --> 01:16:05,724
to sell you their land
after that?

966
01:16:06,492 --> 01:16:08,027
Answer me.

967
01:16:08,060 --> 01:16:10,229
No, the pipeline went through.

968
01:16:11,497 --> 01:16:14,466
Low-intensity ops.
It's a nasty business.

969
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:17,770
But it's fucking effective.

970
01:16:17,803 --> 01:16:19,772
Your friends
wrote the textbook for it.

971
01:16:19,805 --> 01:16:22,441
Well, perhaps
you should have read Chapter 10.

972
01:16:22,474 --> 01:16:24,310
"Kill Kids With Mobile Phones."

973
01:16:24,343 --> 01:16:26,378
(Grace) <i>Or the prime minister</i>

974
01:16:26,412 --> 01:16:29,081
<i>could just admit
that he hired us.</i>

975
01:16:29,114 --> 01:16:31,517
(Clements)
<i>Clearly he ain't gonna do that.</i>

976
01:16:31,550 --> 01:16:34,920
(Grace) <i>Then clearly
we have to get paid.</i>

977
01:16:34,954 --> 01:16:39,858
Payment can be arranged.
Britgaz has got...

978
01:16:39,892 --> 01:16:41,393
(Grace) <i>A pipeline
in the Channel Tunnel.</i>

979
01:16:41,427 --> 01:16:44,897
<i>Not many people
know about that.</i>

980
01:16:44,930 --> 01:16:46,198
<i>My father did.</i>

981
01:16:47,199 --> 01:16:48,801
<i>If you don't pay us,</i>

982
01:16:48,834 --> 01:16:51,370
and guarantee safe passage,

983
01:16:51,403 --> 01:16:56,408
I will destroy this tunnel
and... everyone in it.

984
01:16:57,443 --> 01:17:01,280
<i>Do you understand?</i>

985
01:17:01,313 --> 01:17:06,986
If you well and truly fuck off,
I'll get you your money,

986
01:17:07,019 --> 01:17:08,554
and your safe passage.

987
01:17:08,587 --> 01:17:10,889
Agreed.

988
01:17:10,923 --> 01:17:13,492
But I want wire confirmation
in the next 30 minutes.

989
01:17:13,525 --> 01:17:14,927
OK.

990
01:17:28,274 --> 01:17:31,443
- You get that?
- Loud and clear.

991
01:17:33,078 --> 01:17:35,281
All call signs,
the device is in position

992
01:17:35,314 --> 01:17:38,083
and the anti-tamper triggers
are set.

993
01:17:38,117 --> 01:17:40,019
Stand still.

994
01:17:42,521 --> 01:17:44,456
Pull the trigger
and I'll detonate.

995
01:17:45,324 --> 01:17:47,426
Suicide bomber, are you?

996
01:17:47,459 --> 01:17:51,130
Well, we're all
about to get dead anyway.

997
01:17:51,163 --> 01:17:54,933
The ones that survive, enjoy.

998
01:17:54,967 --> 01:17:57,102
Not much joy in this job, mate.

999
01:17:57,136 --> 01:18:01,540
We either get we want
or we fuck you up severely.

1000
01:18:01,573 --> 01:18:04,410
Hijack a train
under 75 meters of rock,

1001
01:18:04,443 --> 01:18:06,245
death is the most likely result.

1002
01:18:06,278 --> 01:18:08,247
And you and everyone else
in this tunnel

1003
01:18:08,280 --> 01:18:10,416
will burn along with us.

1004
01:18:12,217 --> 01:18:13,886
Drop it.

1005
01:19:10,677 --> 01:19:12,611
(newsreader) <i>Eurostream
officials have so far</i>

1006
01:19:12,645 --> 01:19:15,247

(woman) Sir Charles Whiteside
from Britgaz, Prime Minister.

1016
01:19:41,373 --> 01:19:44,576
(prime minister)
Thank you for coming.

1017
01:19:44,610 --> 01:19:47,312
So what does your board
have to say?

1018
01:19:49,248 --> 01:19:53,619
We've agreed your 500 million.
A bargain, really.

1019
01:19:53,653 --> 01:19:57,189
Of course, this stays
out of the public domain.

1020
01:19:57,222 --> 01:20:00,526
Britgaz doesn't pay ransoms,
do we?

1021
01:20:00,559 --> 01:20:02,094
Understood.

1022
01:20:25,417 --> 01:20:28,020
(phone rings)

1023
01:20:33,025 --> 01:20:34,159
Thank fuck you're still alive.

1024
01:20:34,193 --> 01:20:37,229
(chuckles)

1025
01:20:37,262 --> 01:20:39,565
Grace is gonna blow up
the tunnel.

1026
01:20:39,598 --> 01:20:41,600
Yeah, yeah, she made
the same threat to Clements.

1027
01:20:41,634 --> 01:20:44,637
It's not a threat.
I found the device.

1028
01:20:44,671 --> 01:20:49,041
- Next to a gas pipeline.
- Well, can you disarm it?

1029
01:20:49,074 --> 01:20:52,411
<i>No. It has anti-tamper triggers
all over it.</i>

1030
01:20:52,444 --> 01:20:55,715
Tell Bisset
to get the team in there now.

1031
01:20:55,748 --> 01:20:57,349
Bisset's dead, mate.

1032
01:20:59,418 --> 01:21:01,688
- What?
- <i>Grace zapped him.</i>

1033
01:21:03,255 --> 01:21:06,726
Christ. You have control?

1034
01:21:08,828 --> 01:21:11,296
- Yeah.
- <i>Then launch the ER yourself.</i>

1035
01:21:11,330 --> 01:21:12,665
Clements ordered us to wait out.

1036
01:21:12,699 --> 01:21:15,334
What, and let Grace
blow up the tunnel?

1037
01:21:15,367 --> 01:21:17,436
Britgaz just agreed to pay her.

1038
01:21:17,469 --> 01:21:19,338
<i>She'll trigger
the device anyway.</i>

1039
01:21:19,371 --> 01:21:21,473
This isn't about money.
It's revenge.

1040
01:21:21,507 --> 01:21:23,041
Yeah, I know,
and if I was in their shoes,

1041
01:21:23,075 --> 01:21:24,677
I'd be thinking the same thing.

1042
01:21:24,711 --> 01:21:26,612
But setting off a bomb in the
Channel Tunnel, it's suicidal.

1043
01:21:26,646 --> 01:21:29,114
She's operating
as if she's already dead.

1044
01:21:29,147 --> 01:21:30,717
Yeah, well,
if she blows the tunnel,

1045
01:21:30,750 --> 01:21:33,151
she'd better hope Lewis
taught her how to swim out.

1046
01:21:33,185 --> 01:21:37,489
That's the real question, mate,
how does she plan to escape?

1047
01:21:40,359 --> 01:21:44,062
Listen... Tom, mate, just, um...

1048
01:21:45,430 --> 01:21:47,165
find a way out of there,
alright?

1049
01:21:47,199 --> 01:21:50,369
'Cause, I'll be honest,
I need your help, mate.

1050
01:21:50,402 --> 01:21:53,539
Yeah. Sophie needs it more.

1051
01:21:53,572 --> 01:21:55,842
Look, I get that you're in love
and all that.

1052
01:21:55,875 --> 01:21:59,111
- <i>I do.</i>
- No. I just got it now.

1053
01:21:59,144 --> 01:22:00,647
(phone rings)

1054
01:22:02,815 --> 01:22:05,217
Yeah, alright, mate.

1055
01:22:13,660 --> 01:22:14,861
Are you gonna blow the tunnel?

1056
01:22:14,894 --> 01:22:16,595
You sound awfully ungrateful

1057
01:22:16,628 --> 01:22:18,530
for someone
who just got promoted.

1058
01:22:18,564 --> 01:22:20,599
I agreed to help you escape.

1059
01:22:20,633 --> 01:22:22,467
But taking
a gas pipeline hostage

1060
01:22:22,501 --> 01:22:23,636
was never part of the plan.

1061
01:22:23,670 --> 01:22:24,704
<i>Declan, you're just a tiny part</i>

1062
01:22:24,737 --> 01:22:26,371
<i>of this operation.</i>

1063
01:22:26,405 --> 01:22:27,840
Actually, no,
I'm a mission-critical part.

1064
01:22:27,874 --> 01:22:29,508
Assuming you wanna
get out of there alive.

1065
01:22:29,541 --> 01:22:31,276
We're already dead.

1066
01:22:31,310 --> 01:22:34,179
And you will be too
if we don't kill this player.

1067
01:22:37,482 --> 01:22:39,852
<i>He's one of yours, isn't he?</i>

1068
01:22:39,886 --> 01:22:41,486
I've got him under control.

1069
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:44,189
- The fuck you do. Where is he?
- I don't know.

1070
01:22:44,222 --> 01:22:45,725
<i>You must be
in contact with him.</i>

1071
01:22:45,758 --> 01:22:47,559
Yeah, I am,
but I don't know where he is.

1072
01:22:47,593 --> 01:22:50,295
Let's start with his name.

1073
01:22:53,633 --> 01:22:54,834
Tom.

1074
01:23:01,473 --> 01:23:03,609
Look, I did not sign up
for this.

1075
01:23:03,643 --> 01:23:05,611
None of us did.

1076
01:23:05,645 --> 01:23:07,412
So either you help me kill Tom

1077
01:23:07,446 --> 01:23:10,415
or I tell Clements
you're the snide.

1078
01:23:18,958 --> 01:23:21,293
Tom's girlfriend's on the train.

1079
01:23:59,832 --> 01:24:01,500
(yells)

1080
01:24:17,282 --> 01:24:18,918
(text alert)

1081
01:24:35,735 --> 01:24:37,369
(text alert)

1082
01:24:42,942 --> 01:24:44,644
Tom!

1083
01:24:44,677 --> 01:24:45,878
(text alert)

1084
01:24:57,757 --> 01:24:59,726
- (text alert)
- Tom!

1085
01:24:59,759 --> 01:25:02,427
Under train. Same as before.

1086
01:25:03,361 --> 01:25:05,597
Tom, it's a trap!

1087
01:25:40,398 --> 01:25:41,768
Drop it.

1088
01:25:41,801 --> 01:25:43,002
(gun clatters)

1089
01:25:44,402 --> 01:25:45,638
(Tom) Sophie!

1090
01:25:45,671 --> 01:25:46,839
(Sophie) Tom.

1091
01:25:48,074 --> 01:25:50,843
Was it something I said?

1092
01:25:50,877 --> 01:25:53,345
She'd never
leave a casualty behind.

1093
01:25:54,513 --> 01:25:56,348
How sweet.
You know Sophie so well.

1094
01:25:57,817 --> 01:26:00,019
The only reason I'm down here
is because of her.

1095
01:26:00,052 --> 01:26:01,486
Sounds like the simplest thing

1096
01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:03,355
is to offer yourself up
in exchange.

1097
01:26:03,388 --> 01:26:05,758
Then we'd have to
trust each other.

1098
01:26:09,494 --> 01:26:11,731
Let her go.

1099
01:26:11,764 --> 01:26:14,901
Once she's gone, so am I.

1100
01:26:28,613 --> 01:26:30,783
It's not in our nature.

1101
01:26:30,817 --> 01:26:33,820
We're more alike than you know.

1102
01:26:33,853 --> 01:26:36,521
I don't recall
torching any villages.

1103
01:26:36,555 --> 01:26:38,490
How many people have you killed?

1104
01:26:39,859 --> 01:26:41,093
How many?

1105
01:26:45,397 --> 01:26:47,733
- I don't think about it.
- Neither do I.

1106
01:26:47,767 --> 01:26:51,603
Don't think about it.
Don't dream about it.

1107
01:26:51,637 --> 01:26:53,940
So he switches on
and he kills people.

1108
01:26:53,973 --> 01:26:56,642
And then he switches off
and he takes you to Paris.

1109
01:26:56,676 --> 01:26:58,878
- How romantic.
- I'll do it.

1110
01:27:12,524 --> 01:27:15,795
Well, there's only one way
to end this.

1111
01:27:24,837 --> 01:27:28,808
What are you doing, Tom?
What are you doing?

1112
01:27:34,647 --> 01:27:36,782
- (gunshot)
- Tom!

1113
01:27:38,150 --> 01:27:40,385
Run, Sophie, run!

1114
01:27:53,132 --> 01:27:56,434
(gas hisses)

1115
01:28:06,578 --> 01:28:09,749
Shit.

1116
01:28:09,782 --> 01:28:11,851
(newsreader) <i>We're hearing
reports of an explosion</i>

1117
01:28:11,884 --> 01:28:15,021
<i>near to where a Eurostream
train was hijacked.</i>

1118
01:28:15,054 --> 01:28:17,723
<i>The SAS counterterror team
is at the scene,</i>

1119
01:28:17,757 --> 01:28:19,158
<i>and it's clear the situation</i>

1120
01:28:19,191 --> 01:28:21,559
<i>has become
extremely dangerous now.</i>

1121
01:28:21,593 --> 01:28:23,528
ABC, CNN also transmitting.

1122
01:28:23,561 --> 01:28:25,898
Well, where the fuck
is Clements?

1123
01:28:26,766 --> 01:28:28,566
(computer chimes)

1124
01:28:30,970 --> 01:28:32,138
(SAS operator) Quiet!

1125
01:28:32,972 --> 01:28:34,106
Quiet down.

1126
01:28:34,140 --> 01:28:35,908
Answer it.

1127
01:28:39,245 --> 01:28:44,016
This is Sergeant Smith.
I'm the new ground commander.

1128
01:28:44,050 --> 01:28:44,984
What was that explosion?

1129
01:28:45,017 --> 01:28:46,953
<i>That was your man</i>

1130
01:28:46,986 --> 01:28:50,222
<i>trying to rescue
his girlfriend.</i>

1131
01:28:50,256 --> 01:28:54,760
<i>Try that again and I'll torch
the entire tunnel.</i>

1132
01:28:56,929 --> 01:28:58,130
(clears throat)

1133
01:29:02,201 --> 01:29:05,137
Your money's ready for transfer.

1134
01:29:05,171 --> 01:29:07,139
Britgaz just confirmed it.

1135
01:29:07,173 --> 01:29:08,908
<i>I'll need an outside line</i>

1136
01:29:08,941 --> 01:29:11,010
<i>to verify
that it's reached the account.</i>

1137
01:29:12,577 --> 01:29:14,113
Opening now.

1138
01:29:16,082 --> 01:29:18,651
Eurocopter is fueled
and standing by.

1139
01:29:21,087 --> 01:29:22,254
End the call.

1140
01:29:34,700 --> 01:29:37,970
- That's it. It's uncoupled?
- Yeah. Well done.

1141
01:29:38,004 --> 01:29:41,307
The passengers are consolidated
and we have the money.

1142
01:29:41,340 --> 01:29:44,176
Wire everyone their cut,
including Declan.

1143
01:29:49,348 --> 01:29:51,717
I was aiming for soft tissue.

1144
01:29:52,685 --> 01:29:54,286
What about the player?

1145
01:29:54,320 --> 01:29:57,289
It'll take too long to put
the fire out and confirm him.

1146
01:29:57,323 --> 01:30:00,126
We should assume
he's still in the battle space.

1147
01:30:00,159 --> 01:30:01,827
Come on.

1148
01:30:11,637 --> 01:30:14,340
Right, Olivia, set up
our control point over there.

1149
01:30:14,373 --> 01:30:16,642
Yeah, boss, I'm on it.

1150
01:30:16,675 --> 01:30:17,877
I've got three sniper positions

1151
01:30:17,910 --> 01:30:19,211
and my team's
looking for one more.

1152
01:30:19,245 --> 01:30:21,080
- Right.
- Hey.

1153
01:30:21,113 --> 01:30:23,215
You know, I can drop all of 'em
before they get to the heli.

1154
01:30:23,249 --> 01:30:25,017
Just give me the word.

1155
01:30:25,051 --> 01:30:27,219
Tom'll have his day.

1156
01:30:29,288 --> 01:30:31,657
Dec. You alright?

1157
01:30:31,690 --> 01:30:34,960
- Yeah, I'm fine. Course.
- Paddy.

1158
01:30:51,877 --> 01:30:53,779
I like your hoodie.

1159
01:30:55,014 --> 01:30:56,916
Take it off.

1160
01:30:58,184 --> 01:30:59,584
Now.

1161
01:31:15,701 --> 01:31:17,002
(Sophie) Help!

1162
01:31:18,003 --> 01:31:20,773
- (sobs)
- Shh!

1163
01:31:31,350 --> 01:31:33,786
Up you go.

1164
01:31:44,230 --> 01:31:46,265
<i>All call signs, this is Alpha.</i>

1165
01:31:46,298 --> 01:31:49,301
<i>The train is two minutes out.
Call the heli in.</i>

1166
01:31:49,335 --> 01:31:54,240
Papa 1-4, this is Alpha.
All clear. Call in now.

1167
01:31:54,273 --> 01:31:57,977
(pilot) <i>Papa 1-4.
Roger that. On approach.</i>

1168
01:32:16,195 --> 01:32:17,997
Put the fucking mask on.

1169
01:32:18,464 --> 01:32:19,832
Move!

1170
01:32:36,215 --> 01:32:37,249
Gas.

1171
01:32:37,283 --> 01:32:39,051
(Olly) Get inside.

1172
01:32:40,419 --> 01:32:42,855
(bleeping)

1173
01:32:42,888 --> 01:32:45,090
Setting the anti-tamper
triggers now.

1174
01:32:58,370 --> 01:33:00,372
(Olly) Wait.

1175
01:33:00,406 --> 01:33:01,440
OK.

1176
01:33:01,473 --> 01:33:03,008
(grunts)

1177
01:33:12,851 --> 01:33:14,453
Come on, get in.

1178
01:33:16,055 --> 01:33:17,289
Get in.

1179
01:33:17,323 --> 01:33:20,025
Olly, get the other sled.

1180
01:33:22,094 --> 01:33:23,762
Sophie!

1181
01:33:24,296 --> 01:33:26,031
Go.

1182
01:33:27,566 --> 01:33:30,002
I'll take care of him.

1183
01:33:31,904 --> 01:33:33,739
Dad would be proud.

1184
01:33:48,520 --> 01:33:50,990
(alarm blares)

1185
01:34:27,359 --> 01:34:29,428
(gasps)

1186
01:34:41,273 --> 01:34:45,110
(Declan) <i>All call signs,
Alpha has Eurostream.</i>

1187
01:34:45,144 --> 01:34:48,180
<i>That's the cockpit unmanned.
On autopilot.</i>

1188
01:34:48,213 --> 01:34:50,949
<i>Slowing. Slowing.</i>

1189
01:34:52,418 --> 01:34:53,552
Slowing.

1190
01:34:55,254 --> 01:34:57,456
Stop. That's Eurostream static.

1191
01:35:02,561 --> 01:35:06,298
If you have Grace,
take the shot.

1192
01:35:09,935 --> 01:35:12,271
I thought she had safe passage.

1193
01:35:12,304 --> 01:35:13,505
Change of plan.

1194
01:35:13,539 --> 01:35:16,975
<i>If you can target her,
take the shot.</i>

1195
01:35:19,511 --> 01:35:22,381
This is Alpha.

1196
01:35:22,414 --> 01:35:24,450
All Sierras stand by.

1197
01:35:24,483 --> 01:35:26,485
We're gonna drop the Swans.

1198
01:35:30,356 --> 01:35:33,192
Stand by. Stand by.
Possible Swans in Coach 19.

1199
01:35:33,225 --> 01:35:36,528
(sniper) <i>Sierra 5.
Swans, Coach 19. Confirmed.</i>

1200
01:35:36,562 --> 01:35:38,897
(Black Swan)
Remember what we agreed.

1201
01:35:38,931 --> 01:35:44,671
Do what I say when I say
and we all get to go home.

1202
01:35:44,704 --> 01:35:46,071
(phone bleeps)

1203
01:35:48,140 --> 01:35:51,043
Now, get your hoods up.

1204
01:36:05,057 --> 01:36:07,126
(Declan) <i>All call signs,
this is Alpha.</i>

1205
01:36:07,159 --> 01:36:09,361
<i>That's the hostages
exiting the Eurostream.</i>

1206
01:36:09,395 --> 01:36:12,231
<i>Sierra call signs,
we need eyes on Grace.</i>

1207
01:36:12,264 --> 01:36:14,433
<i>Eyes on Grace.</i>

1208
01:36:19,171 --> 01:36:21,674
<i>All call signs,
is Grace sighted?</i>

1209
01:36:28,514 --> 01:36:32,652
<i>Sierra call signs, I repeat,
does anyone have eyes on Grace?</i>

1210
01:36:32,685 --> 01:36:35,254
(sniper) <i>Sierra 5.
Grace unsighted.</i>

1211
01:36:35,287 --> 01:36:38,390
<i>Possible Swan. Blue on black.</i>

- Unsighted.

1217

You know I'll do it.

1229

1230
01:38:15,587 --> 01:38:17,589

1236
01:38:46,518 --> 01:38:49,154

Grace unsighted.</i>

1237

<i>I say again, Grace unsighted.</i>

1238
01:38:51,290 --> 01:38:55,460
Looks like Grace
did a runner. Again.

1239
01:38:55,494 --> 01:38:57,496
You fucking snide.

1240
01:39:05,170 --> 01:39:06,839

1246
01:39:38,303 --> 01:39:40,606
Killing me won't stop Tom.

1247
01:39:41,874 --> 01:39:43,676
Perhaps this will.

1248
01:39:43,710 --> 01:39:45,745
(screams)

1249
01:39:52,484 --> 01:39:54,319
Sophie.

1250
01:39:54,353 --> 01:39:57,255
Don't worry.
This will stop the bleeding.

1251
01:39:58,523 --> 01:39:59,692
Pull.

1252
01:40:00,927 --> 01:40:04,162
Tom, drop her.

1253
01:40:06,799 --> 01:40:09,167
- What?
- Tom...

1254
01:40:10,970 --> 01:40:12,805
I understand.

1255
01:40:16,241 --> 01:40:17,810
Drop her.

1256
01:40:20,612 --> 01:40:21,814
Go.

1257
01:40:48,273 --> 01:40:49,474
(Declan groans)

1258
01:40:49,508 --> 01:40:50,677
Shit.

1259
01:40:59,384 --> 01:41:03,255
You. You've got
a decision to make.

1260
01:41:05,858 --> 01:41:09,394
Choose wisely
and I'll help you sort this out.

1261
01:41:09,428 --> 01:41:11,296
(laughs)

1262
01:41:14,299 --> 01:41:18,771
Mate, I've seen the way
you sort things out.

1263
01:41:18,805 --> 01:41:20,673
You don't give a shit
about anyone,

1264
01:41:20,707 --> 01:41:23,341
let alone a fucking snide.

1265
01:41:23,375 --> 01:41:26,646
I give enough of a shit
to find you.

1266
01:41:26,679 --> 01:41:28,748
And fucking kill you.

1267
01:41:28,781 --> 01:41:34,687
Yeah, well, when the world finds
out what you've been up to,

1268
01:41:34,721 --> 01:41:37,924
they'll be coming after you,
not me.

1269
01:41:40,760 --> 01:41:42,527

1320
01:46:56,976 --> 01:46:58,711
Always have.

1321

If you were to drop me
right now,

1322
01:47:03,349 --> 01:47:05,284
would you think twice about it?

No.

1324
01:47:13,025 --> 01:47:15,661
I'm the same way.

1325

It's a gift.

1326
01:47:28,641 --> 01:47:30,810
A gift we both share.

1327
01:47:33,779 --> 01:47:36,048
A gift?

1328
01:47:36,082 --> 01:47:38,851
I reckon most people
wouldn't see it that way.

1329
01:47:38,884 --> 01:47:41,987
Most people are weak
and filled with doubt.

1330
01:47:42,922 --> 01:47:44,622
Maybe.

1331
01:47:45,391 --> 01:47:47,159
But they still...

1332
01:47:48,828 --> 01:47:50,996
They still deserve...

01:47:52,331 --> 01:47:54,066
(laughs)

1334
01:47:54,967 --> 01:47:56,702
Love?

1335
01:47:56,735 --> 01:47:58,671
I've never loved anyone
in my entire life,

1336
01:47:58,704 --> 01:47:59,905
and neither have you.

1337
01:48:01,974 --> 01:48:03,642
That's not true.

1338
01:48:04,910 --> 01:48:06,245
Not any more.

1339
01:48:06,278 --> 01:48:12,184
Tom, Sophie will eventually
leave you.

1340
01:48:12,218 --> 01:48:14,987
'Cause she will never understand
who you really are.

1341
01:48:15,020 --> 01:48:17,223
She understands now.

1342
01:48:19,825 --> 01:48:21,327
You...

1343
01:48:23,095 --> 01:48:26,031
are rare, and special.

1344
01:48:27,766 --> 01:48:30,369
Let me help you embrace
who you really are.

1345
01:48:31,971 --> 01:48:34,206
A true Black Swan.

1346
01:48:40,846 --> 01:48:42,348
You're right.

1347
01:48:44,383 --> 01:48:46,085
I am.

1348
01:50:12,338 --> 01:50:14,173
You OK?

1349
01:50:24,984 --> 01:50:27,453
If you ever wanna
talk about it up here...

1350
01:50:31,390 --> 01:50:36,795
Actually, there's something
I've been meaning to ask you.

1351
01:50:53,979 --> 01:50:56,181
Is that why you wanted
to go to Paris?

1352
01:50:57,182 --> 01:50:58,550
Will you marry me?

1353
01:51:12,298 --> 01:51:15,034
If I thought
I could make you happy, I would.

1354
01:51:17,536 --> 01:51:19,271
But, Tom...

1355
01:51:20,339 --> 01:51:22,474
you're not meant to be married.

1356
01:51:23,575 --> 01:51:26,011
I know that now, and so do you.

1357
01:51:34,453 --> 01:51:36,889
- I thought you understood.
- I do.

1358
01:51:57,476 --> 01:51:58,911
Sophie...

1359
01:52:03,549 --> 01:52:05,317
Oh, my...

1360
01:52:07,186 --> 01:52:08,921
Are you...?

1361
01:52:11,023 --> 01:52:13,158
It's news to me as well.

1362
01:52:22,568 --> 01:52:26,639
I love you.
Please, marry me.

01:53:16,021 --> 01:53:17,724
<i>have called him a hero
for what they say</i>

1384
01:53:17,757 --> 01:53:20,359
<i>is his battle against
institutional corruption.</i>

1385
01:53:20,392 --> 01:53:22,961
<i>They've repeated the claim,
first made by Grace Lewis,</i>

1386
01:53:22,995 --> 01:53:24,731
<i>that it was
the British government</i>

1387
01:53:24,764 --> 01:53:27,199
<i>that ordered a massacre
in the Republic of Georgia</i>

1388
01:53:27,232 --> 01:53:29,468
<i>to pave the way
for a gas pipeline.</i>

1389
01:53:29,501 --> 01:53:32,137
(newsreader 2) <i>Britgaz, one of
the UK's largest corporations,</i>

1390
01:53:32,171 --> 01:53:33,706
<i>has denied those allegations</i>

1391
01:53:33,740 --> 01:53:36,709
<i>and expressed its sympathy
for all the victims.</i>

1392
01:53:36,743 --> 01:53:38,544
<i>Its chairman,
Sir Charles Whiteside,</i>

1393
01:53:38,577 --> 01:53:41,079
<i>had refused to make any further
comment until today,</i>

1394
01:53:41,113 --> 01:53:45,284
<i>when he phoned in to our studio
for this exclusive interview.</i>

1395
01:53:45,317 --> 01:53:46,585
<i>Sir Charles,
what's your response</i>

1396
01:53:46,618 --> 01:53:48,220
<i>to the Grace Lewis video,</i>

1397
01:53:48,253 --> 01:53:50,022
<i>which implies
Britgaz was willing</i>

1398
01:53:50,055 --> 01:53:52,090
<i>to pay the perpetrators
for their silence?</i>

1399
01:53:52,124 --> 01:53:53,760
(Sir Charles) <i>Clearly
the video was constructed</i>

1400
01:53:53,793 --> 01:53:56,261
<i>by this Grace Lewis
in a pathetic attempt</i>

1401
01:53:56,295 --> 01:53:58,597
<i>to deflect attention
from her crimes.</i>

1402
01:53:58,630 --> 01:54:00,532
(newsreader 2) <i>So you'd support
a full investigation</i>

1403
01:54:00,566 --> 01:54:02,568
<i>into the attack
and these claims?</i>

1404
01:54:02,601 --> 01:54:05,137
(Sir Charles) <i>Yes, as it would
reveal the inconvenient truth:</i>

1405
01:54:05,170 --> 01:54:07,439
<i>our own security services
were betrayed,</i>

1406
01:54:07,473 --> 01:54:09,742
<i>and this led to a tragic
loss of life and property.</i>

1407
01:54:09,776 --> 01:54:11,443
(newsreader 2)
<i>Are you referring</i>

1408
01:54:11,477 --> 01:54:13,412
<i>to former SAS commander
Declan Smith?</i>

1409
01:54:13,445 --> 01:54:15,682
(Sir Charles) <i>I'm aware that
a Red Notice has been issued</i>

1410
01:54:15,715 --> 01:54:17,349
<i>for a man by that name,</i>

1411
01:54:17,382 --> 01:54:19,518
<i>and I look forward
to seeing justice done.</i>

1412
01:54:19,551 --> 01:54:21,587
(newsreader 2) <i>Victims
of the Eurostream attack</i>

1413
01:54:21,620 --> 01:54:24,089

<i>on a private yacht or villa

1415
01:54:27,559 --> 01:54:28,795

<i>that brought down
the Channel Tunnel</i>

(Sophie) I, Dr Sophie Hart,

1453
01:55:57,349 --> 01:56:01,453

Thomas William Buckingham III,

01:56:01,486 --> 01:56:04,356
to be
my lawfully wedded husband,

1455
01:56:04,389 --> 01:56:07,392
to have and to hold
from this day forward,

1456
01:56:08,327 --> 01:56:10,362
for better, for worse,

1457
01:56:10,395 --> 01:56:12,832
in war and peace,

1458
01:56:12,865 --> 01:56:18,838
knowing that in war, your crazy
brain is always right.

1459
01:56:18,871 --> 01:56:22,742
And I will never wonder what
you get up to in the loo again.

1460
01:56:22,775 --> 01:56:25,143
Trust me,
you don't want to know.

I, Thomas William
Buckingham III,

1462
01:56:34,386 --> 01:56:37,189

1467
01:56:46,598 --> 01:56:51,904
knowing that in peace your
prognosis will always be right.

1468
01:56:51,938 --> 01:56:53,640
Also I'll never freeze
your dead cat again.

1469
01:56:53,673 --> 01:56:55,908
A very wise decision, sir.

1470
01:57:08,353 --> 01:57:11,289
By the power vested in me
by the local mayor,

1471
01:57:11,323 --> 01:57:15,560
who you generously supported
in his re-election campaign,

1472
01:57:15,594 --> 01:57:18,798
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

1473
01:57:19,699 --> 01:57:21,634
You may kiss the bride.

1474
01:57:24,737 --> 01:57:26,271
(phone rings)

1475
01:57:27,272 --> 01:57:29,709
Oh, fuck.

1476
01:57:29,742 --> 01:57:31,978
Took him long enough.

1477
01:57:32,011 --> 01:57:34,212
Go on, then.

1478
01:57:36,015 --> 01:57:37,650
Yes, boss?

1479
01:57:37,684 --> 01:57:40,285
(Clements) <i>Are you married yet
or what?</i>

1480
01:57:40,318 --> 01:57:44,256
- Just.
- <i>It'll all end in tears.</i>

1481
01:57:44,289 --> 01:57:45,958
I'll give your love
to the missus.

1482
01:57:45,992 --> 01:57:49,294
<i>Hey, I've got a wedding present
for you.</i>

1483
01:57:51,363 --> 01:57:52,631
You found the money.

1484
01:57:52,665 --> 01:57:54,801
<i>Right where
you thought it'd be.</i>

1485
01:57:55,668 --> 01:57:56,803
And Declan?

1486
01:57:56,836 --> 01:57:59,271
<i>That cunt is sitting on it.</i>

1487
01:58:00,439 --> 01:58:01,708
Alright, stand by.

1488
01:58:04,576 --> 01:58:07,412
Wanna take a rain check
on the honeymoon?

1489
01:58:07,446 --> 01:58:09,816
Yeah.

1490
01:58:09,849 --> 01:58:11,951
Drop him.

1491
01:58:11,984 --> 01:58:13,485
You sure?

1492
01:58:13,518 --> 01:58:16,555
I never liked
that little fucker.

1493
01:58:21,626 --> 01:58:23,361
Drop him.

1494
01:58:30,469 --> 01:58:32,304
