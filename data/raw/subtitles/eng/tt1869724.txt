1
00:00:48,424 --> 00:00:50,174
Ah, heaven,

2
00:00:50,342 --> 00:00:53,219
God's wondrous creation,

3
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:56,472
His perfect domain.

4
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:01,144
Could there ever be
a place more...

5
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:03,771
well, heavenly?

6
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:13,925
Nothing in creation compares
to heaven with its streets of gold,

7
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:16,844
its perfect location in the universe,

8
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:19,180
its perfect weather.

9
00:02:19,348 --> 00:02:23,893
And every day every resident,
from the angels and cherubs

10
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:26,854
to the seraphim and archangels--

11
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:30,900
in fact, all the celestial beings
including the angemals--

12
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:32,360
yes,

13
00:02:32,528 --> 00:02:36,364
to answer the age old question,
there are indeed animals in heaven--

14
00:02:36,532 --> 00:02:41,244
all do their best to keep heaven
the perfectly perfect place

15
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:43,913
God created it to be.

16
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:57,218
Hmph, gotcha.

17
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:00,721
- Whoa!
- Whoa.

18
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:02,849
Whoa!

19
00:03:05,978 --> 00:03:08,104
Watch where
you're going, miniwings!

20
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:11,065
Yes well,

21
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:13,276
except for one little fellow.

22
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:16,320
And we'll get to him in a moment.

23
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:18,072
Among all the heavenly beings,

24
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,866
the little angels are the ones

25
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,410
who must work the hardest
on perfection.

26
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:33,254
They must learn to keep
their heavenly clothes perfectly clean.

27
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:41,012
They must be certain their halos
sparkle like sunlight.

28
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:49,103
And they must practice
practice practice

29
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:52,565
to become the most
angelic beings they can be

30
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:56,110
so they may one day
help all of humanity.

31
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:03,618
Welcome to Angel Academy,
where angels train

32
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:06,954
and every day feels like Sunday.

33
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:38,903
Whoa!

34
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:43,157
Good morning, my little cherubs,

35
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:46,911
and welcome to another
perfect day at Angel Academy.

36
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:50,790
Step right up to the wingding.

37
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,334
Let's see how many
of God's lessons you've learned

38
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:55,252
and how much your wings
have grown.

39
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,713
- Me me me!
- Sarah.

40
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:06,180
Excellent.
5cms growth since last time.

41
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:09,183
Keep up the good work
in cloud-fluffing class, Sarah.

42
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:11,477
You'll be flying
back and forth to earth

43
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:13,729
doing the good Lord's work
in no time.

44
00:05:17,693 --> 00:05:20,695
Excellent. Off you go.

45
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,697
Flight training
class for you, Joshua.

46
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:24,448
Ow!

47
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:30,955
After-school tutoring
might be in order for Joshua.

48
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:36,002
Hurry hurry, but remember,
it's not angelic to push.

49
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,170
l see you there, Mary.
Don't dally now.

50
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,381
Mustn't be late
for good deed class.

51
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:46,387
Ah, another day
of perfect attendance.

52
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:49,974
Yes, all's right in heaven
and earth this glorious mor--

53
00:05:50,142 --> 00:05:52,977
there's one angel missing.

54
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:02,903
Poor angel Alban.

55
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:04,655
Oh!

56
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:07,408
Heaven knows he tries to teach
all his young charges

57
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:11,704
everything there is to know
about being God's perfect angels.

58
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:18,127
But it seems
there is one little angel--

59
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:20,755
no matter how hard Alban tries,

60
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:24,383
he's never able to make
this one shape up and fly right.

61
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:29,263
l'm speaking
of heaven's littlest angel.

62
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:37,605
l see you, big guy.
You won't get away this time.

63
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:43,986
Gotcha.

64
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:45,738
Whoa!

65
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:56,791
- Yikes!
- Oh my!

66
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:59,794
What in heaven's name?

67
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:06,217
Watch out!

68
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:13,349
Aha!

69
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:16,352
There you are, you little--
little--

70
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,145
little angel, you.

71
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:20,356
Headmaster.

72
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:24,985
You missed
the morning school bell again.

73
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:27,404
Let go of that rope this instant.

74
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:29,365
Yes, Headmaster.

75
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:31,242
l'm-- whoa!

76
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:34,328

108
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:24,939
you won't fly again
until the end of days.

109
00:09:31,655 --> 00:09:34,323

l'll get you.

110
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:37,493
You, stop. Wait.

111
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:57,221
"Heavenly Streets of Gold"
public service announcement

112
00:09:57,389 --> 00:10:00,224
take 93. And action.

113
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:04,311
Heavenly residents, in order
to make heaven a more peaceful place

114
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:07,481
we kindly ask thee
to honor thy curfew,

115
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:12,069
keep the peace and never speak
in other than the most dulcet tones.

116
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:20,786
- Oof!
- Cut cut cut cut!

117
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:22,830
Can't you see
we're filming here?

118
00:10:22,998 --> 00:10:26,166
Alban?

119
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:30,462
- Alban, it's me Logan.
- Logan?

120
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:34,717
Angel Academy's number one
draft pick into the archangels.

121
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:36,719
- Don't you remember--
- l hate to break up

122
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:39,013
your little
training school reunion

123
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,432
but we're trying to film here!

124
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:44,893
L-L-- Logan!
Yes, of course l remember.

125
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:48,355
Didn't you hold the school's
speed cloud jumping record?

126
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:50,524
You remembered!

127
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:53,068
Logan, l need your help.

128
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:57,031
- l've got a truant angel on the run.
- Come on.

129
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:59,908
We'll take Brimstone.

130
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:14,173
You walk off this shoot
and there'll be heck to pay, Logan!

131
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:15,382
God--

132
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:19,261
Sorry.
The H-word, l know.

133
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:38,822
Logan, there he is.

134
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:41,992
Oh no, the Four Horses
of the Apocalypse

135
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,870
are coming down the home stretch
having their workout.

136
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:50,250
- Whoa!
- Keep practicing, boys.

137
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:53,462
Your day will come.

138
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:57,132
That does it! Your wings are clipped
and you're grounded.

139
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,718
- But l was only trying to catch--
- Trust me, little guy,

140
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:02,429
you don't want to "but" him
when he's in this kind of mood.

141
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:12,398
five demerits.

142
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:15,692
seven demerits.

143
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,779
- But l saw a dog--
- Oh, don't be absurd.

144
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:20,739
There are no dogs
in Celestial City.

145
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:23,867
Everyone knows all the animals
except the beasts of burden

146
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:26,453
choose to live out
in the heavenly countryside.

147
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:29,790
10 demerits.

148
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:32,543
- But l swear l saw him.
- Ah ah ah!

149
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:35,129
15 demerits.

150
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:37,589
Kid, quit while you're ahead.

151
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:41,468
But l saw a dog, Logan.
l used to have one of my own.

152
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:43,637
l know what they
look and sound like.

153
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:46,098
Yeah well, see,
this is heaven, little guy.

154
00:12:47,142 --> 00:12:50,436
Take a gander-- beautiful
and big enough for all the animals

155
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,980
to have their own space
to live wild and free.

156
00:12:53,148 --> 00:12:55,649
No masters telling them
what to do up here,

157
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:58,318
so the animals all stick
to their side of heaven.

158
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:02,656
Exactly. So you're going to have
to come up with a better excuse

159
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:05,033
than "l was chasing a doggy."

160
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:16,837
All right, everyone, get ready

00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:05,339
and he wondered what they'd do

178
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:08,842
to a little angel who just wasn't
happy in the grandest place

179
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:11,261
in all the universe.

180
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:50,425
Littlest. Littlest.

181
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:54,596
Littlest?

182
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:12,239
Littlest.
So you're the one

183
00:17:12,407 --> 00:17:14,866
who's been making heaven
so unheavenly.

184
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:18,286
Um, l guess so.

185
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:21,248
Why don't you
tell me all about it?

186
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,794
And suddenly before
he knew it, he was explaining

187
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:29,756
how very difficult it was for a boy
who suddenly finds himself

188
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:34,469
transformed into an angel.
And no matter what Alban had told her,

189
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:37,097
he'd only swung once.

190
00:17:37,265 --> 00:17:39,683
Well, twice.

191
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:44,104
Oh, all right. Then he'd swung
three times on the pearly gates.

192
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:46,106
That was only
for something to do.

193
00:17:46,274 --> 00:17:49,943
But heaven is full
of wonderful things to do and see

194
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:53,196
- and be.
- lt's not that heaven isn't beautiful.

195
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:58,910
- But earth was really great.
- lndeed.

196
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,704
What did you like so much?

197
00:18:00,872 --> 00:18:03,832
Well, you know it was created
by God himself

198
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,501
and there were trees to climb

199
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:08,837
and brooks to fish

200
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:11,715
and caves to play hide 'n' seek,

201
00:18:11,883 --> 00:18:14,801
the swimming hole and sun

202
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:16,303
and rain

203
00:18:16,471 --> 00:18:18,805
and dark and dawn

204
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:21,850
and the thick mud that
squished between your toes.

205
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:25,812
And here, even though
l try to do angel stuff,

206
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:29,399
l miss things the way
they were on earth.

207
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:42,829
l'm going to show you
all heaven has to offer

208
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:46,374
once you've earned
your full-grown angel wings.

209
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:50,253
Yeah well,

210
00:18:50,421 --> 00:18:52,422
how come mine
never seem to grow?

211
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:56,885
Simple, you haven't completed your
good deeds class at the academy.

212
00:18:57,053 --> 00:19:01,890
You mean if l do that, l'll grow big
wings like yours and Logan's?

213
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:05,685
Not quite.
For you see, Littlest,

214
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:08,021
everything you've been
learning so far

215
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:11,149
makes it easier for you
to be a good angel.

216
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:15,237
Next you'll be required
to master minor miracles

217
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:19,074
in good deeds class.
When you've done that,

218
00:19:19,242 --> 00:19:21,576
then you'll be required
to travel to earth

219
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:25,121
and perform three
honest-to-goodness

220
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:29,084
unselfish good deeds
and earn your angel wings.

221
00:19:29,252 --> 00:19:31,711
But for now,

222
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:34,172
l think you'll find
this area of heaven

223
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:37,884
has a little bit more of what's been
making you so homesick.

224
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:43,932
Wow!

225
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:49,646
Look what l can do!

226
00:19:49,814 --> 00:19:52,190
But a million boys can do that.

227
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:54,985
Look what
an angel can do, Littlest.

228
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,452
Awesome!

229
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:13,128
You see, Littlest, there are lots
of fun benefits to being an angel.

230
00:20:13,296 --> 00:20:17,632
You mean l can do that too?
How? Show me, Angel Eve.

231
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,760
- Please!
- As with everything in life

232
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:24,764
and here in the hereafter,
practice makes perfect.

233
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:27,475
You do already
have the angel power.

234
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,436
Try it.

235
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:34,482
Ah, it's getting away!

236
00:20:37,028 --> 00:20:39,404
How do l make it
come back to me?

237
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:42,115
With practice, Littlest.
Just practice.

238
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:51,041
Wow! Angemals.

239
00:21:02,345 --> 00:21:05,931
Angel Eve, look!
There's the dog.

240
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:10,143
That's him. He still has
my rope belt around his neck.

241
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:19,152
Wow! Did you see that?

242
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,280
- He caught my halo.
- A halo for Halo.

243
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:25,200
- What do you mean?
- He caught your halo

244
00:21:25,368 --> 00:21:27,994
and his name
happens to be Halo too.

245
00:21:28,162 --> 00:21:30,747
- You know him?
- Halo!

246
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:32,958
Please bring Littlest his halo.

247
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:43,593
Hi, Halo. Can l keep him?
Please, Angel Eve?

248
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:46,763
Can l bring him back
to Celestial City with me?

249
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:49,057
Can l? Can l, please?

250
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:51,643
lt's a little different
here in heaven.

251
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:54,479
Here we don't keep pets.

252
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:58,692
All the animals live free.
They have a beautiful part of heaven

253
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:02,570
all to themselves right here
in angemal countryside.

254
00:22:07,618 --> 00:22:11,997
But you can come visit this place
and so many other wondrous lands

255
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:16,167
all over heaven once you've completed
your angel training at the academy.

256
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:19,796
Now it's time we get back.

257
00:22:19,964 --> 00:22:22,507
Bye, Halo. Bye!

258
00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:37,772
- What's wrong, Littlest?
- Nothing.

259
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,734
ls there anything other than
the dog you'd like to have?

260
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:43,737
This is heaven, after all.

261
00:22:48,451 --> 00:22:52,037
There's a box l left hidden
in a secret spot back home.

262
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:56,082
lt's filled with treasures l've
collected and it reminds me of home.

263
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,710
l know if l only had them

264
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:00,503
l wouldn't miss earth so much.

265
00:23:00,671 --> 00:23:04,632
Yes well, l'm not sure that's what you
should be thinking about right now.

266
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:08,636
Not when there is so much
you still need to accomplish.

267
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:11,890
Go to class and work hard,
my littlest angel.

268
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:20,273
l'm telling you, Logan,

269
00:23:20,441 --> 00:23:23,026
the littlest angel
must be taught a lesson.

270
00:23:23,194 --> 00:23:25,695
No more Mr. Nice Angel from me.

271
00:23:26,989 --> 00:23:29,574
l've been far too lenient.
When he comes back

272
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:32,911
l'm going to teach that little
insubordinate that what Alban says

273
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:34,788
goes at Angel Academy.

274
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:36,915
And so he thought and thought.

275
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:39,667
Hmm, maybe there's a way
l can get my box

276
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:42,295
and fly the highest
in flight training class.

277
00:23:42,463 --> 00:23:45,340
And finally he concocted
a devilish little plan

278
00:23:45,508 --> 00:23:48,927
to get back to earth
and find his beloved treasure box--

279
00:23:49,095 --> 00:23:51,971
and get in a little flying practice.

280
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:11,866
l'll never be able to fly
all the way to earth

281
00:24:12,034 --> 00:24:14,994
to get my box
with these puny wings.

282
00:24:55,161 --> 00:24:58,079
Whoa!

283
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:10,884
Wahoo! Look at me.
l'm flying.

284
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:26,149
Whoa! Uh-oh.

285
00:25:26,317 --> 00:25:28,651
Whoa whoa!

286
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:32,113
Looks like we got
a little failure to fly.

287
00:25:33,282 --> 00:25:35,158
l got him.

288
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:44,459
Whoa!

289
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:54,219
l haven't seen an angel land that hard
since Lucifer got kicked out of heaven.

290
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:56,346
You can talk?!

291
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:59,224
Of course l can talk.
This is heaven.

292
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:03,853
So where are you heading
with the faux feathers, little guy?

293
00:26:04,021 --> 00:26:08,775
l'm trying to get to earth, but l'm not
quite sure how to get out of heaven.

294
00:26:08,943 --> 00:26:12,987
Funny, most everyone we know
wants to get into heaven.

295
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:15,573
- You can talk too?
- Well, me too.

296
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:17,408
lt's heaven, you know?

297
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:20,370
And us too!

298
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:22,872
Yeah yeah,
but back to you, flyboy.

299
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,375
Just a wild guess,
but something tells me

300
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:29,462
you haven't graduated good deed class
to earn your full wings.

301
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:32,799
Not exactly, but l'm gonna
start trying real hard.

302
00:26:32,967 --> 00:26:37,220
Do you know which way
angels go when they-- you know,

303
00:26:37,388 --> 00:26:40,139
- go to earth?
- Oh sure.

304
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:42,475
But l also know they've got
heavenly reasons

305
00:26:42,643 --> 00:26:45,270
they bop back and forth
between heaven and earth.

306
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:47,730
Doing God's work.

307
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:53,486
What happens if an angel has
a really good reason to go to earth,

308
00:26:53,654 --> 00:26:57,907
but hasn't quite done
his three good deeds yet?

309
00:26:58,075 --> 00:27:01,536
Uh, hmm.
Well, to tell you the truth, no idea.

310
00:27:01,704 --> 00:27:03,746
Hey, any of youse
know what happens?

311
00:27:03,914 --> 00:27:07,166
Nope, but l'm sure
it's a really--

312
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:10,586
really bad idea.

313
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:13,006
Why are you so anxious
to get down there anyway?

314
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:15,883
l have to get back
my special box.

315
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:18,261
lt's filled with all
my earthly treasures.

316
00:27:18,429 --> 00:27:21,055
Oh, a treasure box, huh?

317
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:23,308
Yes, and once l've got it,

318
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:25,643
l know l'll be happy here in heaven.

319
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:29,522
And l'll be able to try real hard
at Angel Academy.

320
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:33,776
And l'll do my three good deeds
and l'll earn my wings.

321
00:27:33,944 --> 00:27:36,404
Easy easy. Sheesh.

322
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:39,032
A type-A angel
if ever there was one.

323
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:41,576
l get it. The box is
real important to you.

324
00:27:41,744 --> 00:27:46,205
And if l had it, l know l could learn
to shake up and fly right.

325
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:49,917
l believe that's "shape up
and fly right."

326
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:53,129
Really really bad idea.

327
00:27:53,297 --> 00:27:56,841
Listen, kid, l may happen
to know a particular cloud

328
00:27:57,009 --> 00:28:00,720
where all the earthbound angels,
you know, come and go from.

329
00:28:00,888 --> 00:28:02,930
Great! Where is it?

330
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:05,767
- You've got to show me.
- Up in your neck of the clouds.

331
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:09,187
You know, Celestial City?
l've watched them lots of times.

332
00:28:09,355 --> 00:28:12,065
But l thought angemals
didn't like to go there.

333
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:14,942
Some of us make the rounds.
Like today,

334
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:17,320
when you almost
noogified me with that rope.

335
00:28:17,488 --> 00:28:20,114
- Sorry about that.
- Fuggedaboutit.

336
00:28:20,282 --> 00:28:22,200
Bygones and all that
other good stuff.

337
00:28:22,368 --> 00:28:24,118
All right,
now here's what we'll do.

338
00:28:24,286 --> 00:28:25,953
See we've gotta get
together on this thing...

339
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:28,122
And so Halo
and the littlest angel

340
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:30,625
became friends-- fast.

341
00:28:33,921 --> 00:28:36,381
- lt's going to be a wonderful day.
- Oh, a beautiful day.

342
00:28:46,642 --> 00:28:48,476
Well, this is it.

343
00:28:48,644 --> 00:28:51,604
Last chance
to change your mind.

344
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,860
The world looks awfully big
from up here, Halo.

345
00:28:58,028 --> 00:28:59,862
How will l find my house?

346
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:04,117
Huh. You know, l think l've heard
all you do is use your angel vision.

347
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:06,702
Angel vision? What's that?

348
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:10,206
To travel to earth using angel vision,
you close your eyes,

349
00:29:10,374 --> 00:29:12,708
picture your exact
landing zone and jump.

350
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:16,337
Okay, l see my house
just the way it used to be.

351
00:29:16,505 --> 00:29:19,048
Good. Now just
hold your nose and jump.

352
00:29:19,216 --> 00:29:21,467
Any chance
you'd jump first?

353
00:29:21,635 --> 00:29:25,221
Come on in, kid.
The air is fi-iiiine!

354
00:29:39,153 --> 00:29:42,864
- We did it, Halo!
- Yep, we pulled off a heaven break.

355
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:45,616
Hey, are you sure
we're in the right spot?

356
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,994
My angel vision worked, Halo.

357
00:29:48,162 --> 00:29:50,121
That's my village over there.

358
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,332
Come on, let's fly like the wind.

359
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,668
Whoa whoa whoa,
take it easy, pal.

360
00:29:55,836 --> 00:29:58,087
Remember,
you're still a novice flapper.

361
00:29:58,255 --> 00:30:00,631
Don't worry, l'm-- whoa!

362
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,885
--totally out of control.
Help, Halo!

363
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:07,180
l knew l should
have been a bird dog.

364
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:09,307
Hurry, Halo, hurry!

365
00:30:11,852 --> 00:30:14,562
Just relax. l got-- whoa!

366
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:19,525
- My halo!
- What?

367
00:30:19,693 --> 00:30:22,195
Not you, my angel halo.

368
00:30:24,615 --> 00:30:27,074
Easy does it now.

369
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:28,659
Whew.

370
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:32,330
That was-- oh no!
Your wings.

371
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:36,209
Halo, mine are gone too.

372
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:37,543
What's happening?

373
00:30:37,711 --> 00:30:39,795
Aw, don't worry.
That always happens

374
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:42,381
when an angel's feet--
or paws-- touch earth.

375
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:45,551
But what are we going to do
without our wings?

376
00:30:45,719 --> 00:30:48,554
How are we gonna get back up
to heaven if we can't fly?

377
00:30:48,722 --> 00:30:51,974
Ah, ye of little faith.
Watch and learn.

378
00:30:52,142 --> 00:30:56,229
All you gotta do is focus real hard--
angel vision, remember?

379
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:58,272
And--

380
00:30:59,733 --> 00:31:01,734
Uh-oh.

381
00:31:01,902 --> 00:31:04,612
Hmm, maybe a little less
face scrunching.

382
00:31:06,323 --> 00:31:09,408
Attaboy! But now
make 'em disappear again.

383
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:11,577
- How come?
- You don't think we're allowed

384
00:31:11,745 --> 00:31:13,913
to run around earth
looking like something

385
00:31:14,081 --> 00:31:16,415
that jumped off
a stained-glass window, do you?

386
00:31:17,751 --> 00:31:20,920
- l get your point.
- And we don't want to break any rules

387
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:23,297
that could get us locked out
of the pearly gates.

388
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:25,424
Okay, wings away.

389
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:30,388
- Uh-oh, halo.
- What?

390
00:31:30,556 --> 00:31:33,266
Not you, that halo.

391
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:36,143
Angel Eve showed me
how to do this.

392
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:44,735
Oh, sweet trick.
But that shiny O over your head

393
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:47,780
is another dead giveaway
you ain't from around here, kid.

394
00:31:47,948 --> 00:31:50,575
Better find someplace
really safe to hide it.

395
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:55,329
l know the perfect place!

396
00:31:55,497 --> 00:31:57,873
l'll hide my halo on my Halo.

397
00:31:58,041 --> 00:31:59,542
Huh?

398
00:32:02,129 --> 00:32:04,380
Now it just looks like
your dog collar.

399
00:32:04,548 --> 00:32:07,800
Okay, time to go play
fetch the treasure box.

400
00:32:07,968 --> 00:32:09,885
So which way?

401
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:12,555
l kinda got turned around
when we were landing.

402
00:32:12,723 --> 00:32:14,724
Well, crashing.

403
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:19,478
But l'm pretty sure
it's just over the next hill.

404
00:32:20,689 --> 00:32:23,149
And so
the littlest angel and his new friend

405
00:32:23,317 --> 00:32:26,902
set out to find his home,
see the places he used to play

406
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:29,864
and retrieve
the missing treasure box.

407
00:32:30,032 --> 00:32:32,491
But they would soon remember
that heaven and earth

408
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:35,328
are two very different
sorts of places.

409
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:48,174
lt wasn't over the next hill
or next or the next after that either.

410
00:32:48,342 --> 00:32:50,092
l never thought l'd say it,

411
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:52,720
but l sure miss my angel wings.

412
00:32:52,888 --> 00:32:57,224
l don't see why it would hurt
to fly up and see where my village is.

413
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:59,685
Nope. Huh-uh.
Rotten idea.

414
00:32:59,853 --> 00:33:01,395
What if some human saw you?

415
00:33:01,563 --> 00:33:03,773
How are you gonna explain
a boy with wings?

416
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,233
l guess you're right.

417
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:07,735
Of course l'm right.
Come on.

418
00:33:07,903 --> 00:33:10,363
Don't know if it's your village,
but my super sniffer's

419
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,698
- picking up people scents.
- Which way?

420
00:33:12,866 --> 00:33:15,534
Just over the next hill.

421
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:23,459
We'll just go up to the house
and ask directions to my village.

422
00:33:23,627 --> 00:33:26,587
l might as well ask them
if they can spare an old bone too.

423
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:30,883
Wait, a talking dog on earth
might seem kind of strange.

424
00:33:31,051 --> 00:33:34,387
You'd betterjust stick to growls
and barks when people are around.

425
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:37,181
Gee, l kinda got used
to speaking my mind.

426
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:40,226
l hope l can remember
how to act like a regular old dog.

427
00:33:40,394 --> 00:33:43,646
Maybe it'd be better to ask
the barnyard animals instead.

428
00:33:43,814 --> 00:33:46,399
Let me think here.

429
00:33:48,235 --> 00:33:49,902
They won't understand me.

430
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:53,239
Earth animals can't talk
like angel animals can.

431
00:33:53,407 --> 00:33:56,158
No sweat. l still remember
how to talk turkey,

432
00:33:56,326 --> 00:33:59,078
and lots of
other critters' tongues too.

433
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:10,423
l'll just ask this goose
and cow which way.

434
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:19,140
That cow sure sounds mad.

435
00:34:24,354 --> 00:34:26,897
Maybe because he's a bull.

436
00:34:27,941 --> 00:34:30,067
- What are they saying?
- Loosely translated:

437
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:32,278
No trespassing.
Get lost.

438
00:34:32,446 --> 00:34:33,738
Run!

439
00:34:58,054 --> 00:35:00,473
l think we lost 'em.

440
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,850
Good, but you forgot
to tell them.

441
00:35:03,018 --> 00:35:05,269
Run!

442
00:35:11,318 --> 00:35:14,695
Come on,
no way bulls can climb trees.

443
00:35:14,863 --> 00:35:16,322
Uh, neither can dogs.

444
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:18,824
Hey, there aren't
any humans around.

445
00:35:18,992 --> 00:35:21,660
Why can't we use our-- wings!

446
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:23,287
Halo, look out!

447
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:35,841
Guess it serves him right
for being so mean.

448
00:35:36,009 --> 00:35:38,302
But l kinda feel sorry for him.

449
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:41,096
l guess we should
try and get him free.

450
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:44,350
l was afraid
you were gonna say that.

451
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:51,732
Okay, one, two,

452
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:54,026
three, pull!

453
00:35:56,613 --> 00:35:58,989
Come on.

454
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:11,168
We're crunchy kibble now.

455
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:13,587
Oh, prepare to be noogified.

456
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:16,173
Huh?

457
00:36:22,556 --> 00:36:25,766
- What did they say?
- The village is--

458
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:28,102
right over the next hill.

459
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:32,940
lt's already night
and kind of dark out.

460
00:36:33,108 --> 00:36:35,651
Maybe we should
wait till morning.

461
00:36:35,819 --> 00:36:38,612
Yeah good, 'cause l'm dog-tired.

462
00:36:44,411 --> 00:36:47,454
lt's weird looking up at heaven.

463
00:36:51,084 --> 00:36:53,544
Huh? Hmmm.

464
00:36:54,671 --> 00:36:57,965
l wonder if anybody
even noticed we're gone.

465
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:14,815
When l get my hands
on that little angel, l'll--

466
00:37:17,277 --> 00:37:19,528
Wait, what's that?

467
00:37:19,696 --> 00:37:21,280
Could this be him?

468
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:28,454
Hear ye, hear ye!

469
00:37:28,622 --> 00:37:31,749
God has decreed
the most glorious event

470
00:37:31,917 --> 00:37:34,168
for all the citizens of earth.

471
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:36,045
He has requested

472
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:38,756
all angels in his firmament

473
00:37:38,924 --> 00:37:41,091
to prepare the most wonderful

474
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:43,802
celebration of all time.

475
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:46,805
Bring your most splendid gifts.

476
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:50,476
What?
What is the celebration for?

477
00:37:50,644 --> 00:37:53,604
You know God will announce
His plan in His own time.

478
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:57,024
But l got word that it'll be soon.
ln the meantime,

479
00:37:57,192 --> 00:37:59,735
prepare your gifts!

480
00:37:59,903 --> 00:38:02,154
Prepare
for the greatest celebration

481
00:38:02,322 --> 00:38:04,865
heaven and earth
have ever known.

482
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:09,536
Oh ho, of all the days.

483
00:38:12,916 --> 00:38:14,375
Logan!

484
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:16,961
Logan...

485
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:20,965
please, get your big sandals
off my desk.

486
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:23,592
This is insufferable, intolerable,

487
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,178
inexcusable, in-- in--

488
00:38:26,346 --> 00:38:28,555
- in--
- Uh, inviting?

489
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:32,267
- lnterns? lnvestments?
- What are you rambling about?

490
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:35,437
l thought we were trying to think
of words starting with "in."

491
00:38:35,605 --> 00:38:38,899
Didn't you hear the messenger angel
who just blew in here?

492
00:38:39,067 --> 00:38:42,111
Sorry, l was listening to
"Hey Hey, Get Off of my Cloud."

493
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:46,281
God has just announced
the biggest, most exciting event

494
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:50,369
He's ever planned for earth.
And heaven needs to start preparations.

495
00:38:50,537 --> 00:38:52,246
l love celebrations!

496
00:38:52,414 --> 00:38:55,666
l hope we get to wear party hats
and blow those funny whistles

497
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:57,292
- that shoot out--
- Ahem!

498
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,294
We need to find that
missing little angel

499
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:01,171
and get him back here
to the academy.

500
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:04,299
Everything must be absolutely
perfect for God's big day.

501
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:08,095
Don't worry. The little tyke has
to be around heaven someplace.

502
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:09,722
Where else could he go?

503
00:39:13,101 --> 00:39:16,770
Well, if l bore you that much,
l'll just be on my way then.

504
00:39:16,938 --> 00:39:20,607
Guess we can look for the littlest guy
first thing in the morning.

505
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:22,026
Hmph!

506
00:39:40,462 --> 00:39:44,006
Come on, Halo.
Just one more hill and we're there.

507
00:39:44,174 --> 00:39:47,468
l'll believe that when l see it.

508
00:39:49,012 --> 00:39:51,597
l can hardly wait
to see my house again

509
00:39:51,765 --> 00:39:54,433
and get my box.

510
00:39:54,601 --> 00:39:58,103
- Uh-oh.
- Yeehaw!

511
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:03,942
What was that all about?

512
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:06,487
They just wanted to say thanks
for the good deed

513
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:09,114
- and warn us to be careful.
- Of what?

514
00:40:09,282 --> 00:40:11,200
- A guard goose and a bull?
- l don't know.

515
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:13,911
lt didn't make much sense to me.
Some cruel creep

516
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:17,372
that uses critters for show?
Whatever the heck that means.

517
00:40:33,181 --> 00:40:35,724
Step right up.

518
00:40:35,892 --> 00:40:38,477
Step right up,
ladies and gentlemen.

519
00:40:38,645 --> 00:40:40,729
See the one and only
two-headed snake

520
00:40:40,897 --> 00:40:44,108
and the amazing talking chicken.

521
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:47,236
l didn't hear
no chicken talking.

522
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:49,404
Just drop in your coins

523
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:52,491
then the chicken will
thank you personally.

524
00:40:57,455 --> 00:41:01,834
Brok! Bok bok!
Look at me, l'm a talking chicken.

525
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:03,585
Brok!
Bok bok bok bok!

526
00:41:07,382 --> 00:41:10,843
Aw, it's a big fake.
The chicken's lips aren't even moving.

527
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:13,846
Hey, we've been gypped.
Give us our money back!

528
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:17,558
l didn't hear any chicken talk.

529
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:20,769
Yeah, you just weren't
watching carefully.

530
00:41:20,937 --> 00:41:23,021
Move your lips, chicken.

531
00:41:24,524 --> 00:41:27,025
Flap your blasted beak, bird!

532
00:41:33,783 --> 00:41:35,033
What?

533
00:41:39,372 --> 00:41:42,249
Stop, wait, come back!

534
00:41:42,417 --> 00:41:45,544
lt's all part of the show.

535
00:41:46,963 --> 00:41:48,839
What were you thinking, woman?

536
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:52,551
Oh, don't tell me you swallowed
the fake snake head again.

537
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:54,428
Don't you know
we need it for the show?

538
00:41:58,725 --> 00:42:02,060
l warned you, Creepedeep.
No one is going to fall

539
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:06,815
for that phony two-headed snake
or your pathetic ventriloquist act.

540
00:42:06,983 --> 00:42:09,943
Mind your own business,
muscle-head.

541
00:42:10,111 --> 00:42:12,738
This traveling show
is my business.

542
00:42:12,906 --> 00:42:16,533
And l'm warning you, unless you
come up with a real attraction,

543
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:18,994
you two are out of here.

544
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,624
Heh heh heh heh.
He'll see.

545
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:26,043
One of these days
l'm going to find

546
00:42:26,211 --> 00:42:28,754
the greatest attraction of all time!

547
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:44,686
What if the people that live here now
already found your special box?

548
00:42:44,854 --> 00:42:49,441
No way! l kept it hidden underneath
a loose floorboard in my bedroom.

549
00:42:49,609 --> 00:42:52,611
- l'll just slip inside and--
- Whoa there, little pup.

550
00:42:52,779 --> 00:42:55,656
Even though your wings aren't showing,
you're still an angel.

551
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:58,116
So breaking into houses
is a "no can do."

552
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:05,707
What's going on?

553
00:43:05,875 --> 00:43:08,627
Looks like your other halo
agrees with me.

554
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:13,131
Yep, no doubt about it.

555
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:15,342
But we're not really breaking in.

556
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:17,469
See, the window's wide open.

557
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:23,934
Plus it's not like l'm stealing
since the box is really mine.

558
00:43:33,903 --> 00:43:36,446
- Guess that means it's all right.
- Good.

559
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:39,491
Then l'll just look inside
and make sure no one's there.

560
00:43:43,246 --> 00:43:45,163
Whoa!

561
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:47,874
- Are you okay?
- l'm fine. Come on.

562
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:50,002
l got a bad feeling about this,

563
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:52,421
but a friend looks out for a friend.

564
00:43:58,011 --> 00:44:00,512
l thought you said
nobody was here.

565
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:04,891
Eh, it's just a little cat.

566
00:44:05,935 --> 00:44:08,186
Don't you know most
earth cats and dogs--

567
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:11,231
- like to fight like cats and dogs?

568
00:44:11,399 --> 00:44:14,359
Shh, we don't want anybody hearing us.

569
00:44:14,527 --> 00:44:17,195
Ahhh!
Someone's in my house! Help!

570
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:22,034
l got it.

571
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:24,286
We'll never make it this way.

572
00:44:24,454 --> 00:44:27,372
Then we'll have to go out
the front before--

573
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:29,666
- Gotcha!
- What do we do now?

574
00:44:29,834 --> 00:44:32,836
What earth dogs do best--
chase cats.

575
00:44:33,004 --> 00:44:35,297
Come here, kitty.

576
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:40,510
Why you--

577
00:44:42,555 --> 00:44:44,931
So sorry.

578
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:47,559
Stop!
ln the name of the law.

579
00:44:47,727 --> 00:44:50,604
Oh, who am l kidding?
l'll never catch them.

580
00:45:00,907 --> 00:45:05,327
This is your last chance.
Confess or else!

581
00:45:05,495 --> 00:45:08,789
- Or else what?
- Good question.

582
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:12,459
Argh, would you just tell me
where the littlest angel is?

583
00:45:12,627 --> 00:45:16,755
- We can't.
- Then l'll just have to make you talk.

584
00:45:16,923 --> 00:45:18,632
Ahh, what are you doing?

585
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,592
l am, after all, still a hero.

586
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:23,345
So l can't let you frighten
the poor little creatures,

587
00:45:23,513 --> 00:45:25,806
even if they are
just dumb animals.

588
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:27,599
Look who's calling us dumb.

589
00:45:27,767 --> 00:45:30,602
Now promise you won't hurt
the nice critters.

590
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:32,854
Fine. Just put me down.

591
00:45:33,022 --> 00:45:34,773
Okay.

592
00:45:38,903 --> 00:45:42,280
Well, if you refuse to tell me
where the littlest angel is,

593
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:44,950
at least give him
a message for me.

594
00:45:45,118 --> 00:45:47,244
How can we when he's so far--

595
00:45:47,412 --> 00:45:50,163
Aha! l knew it.

596
00:45:50,331 --> 00:45:53,250
You do know where he is.

597
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:56,628
Kinda, but don't blame us

598
00:45:56,796 --> 00:46:00,006
since it's mostly your fault
that he's gone.

599
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:01,842
My fault?

600
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:05,637
That's right, Alban. Maybe if you'd
been nicer to the little fella,

601
00:46:05,805 --> 00:46:08,098
he would have felt like
he fit in up here.

602
00:46:08,266 --> 00:46:12,936
Then he wouldn't have been so sad
that he missed his home,

603
00:46:13,104 --> 00:46:16,606
his box and his earthly memories.

604
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:19,151
Have you ever heard such nonsen--

605
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:21,403
Poor little Littlest.

606
00:46:21,571 --> 00:46:25,866
l don't care about some silly box!

607
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:27,701
Just tell me where the boy went.

608
00:46:27,869 --> 00:46:30,495
That's what we're trying to do.

609
00:46:30,663 --> 00:46:32,873
You wanna hear the story or not?

610
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,667
Oooh, l love a good tale.

611
00:46:35,835 --> 00:46:39,379
l want to hear the whole story
from the very beginning. Please!

612
00:46:39,547 --> 00:46:41,715
So he went to earth...

613
00:46:41,883 --> 00:46:46,094
So the mule told the angels
everything he and the ox had seen.

614
00:46:46,262 --> 00:46:49,764
And miracle of miracles,
what do you know?

615
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:51,475
lt even seemed to have

616
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:54,102
a softening effect on Angel Alban.

617
00:46:55,396 --> 00:46:59,566
...and that's the whole sad story.

618
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:05,572
Ahem, yes well, perhaps l have been
a tiny touch too strict with--

619
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:09,743
Saints preserve us,
at last l've found you.

620
00:47:09,911 --> 00:47:13,079
Half of heaven has been searching
for you, Angel Alban.

621
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:16,625
Really? l had no idea
l was so popular.

622
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:19,085
God's announced
what the big celebration is

623
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:21,505
- and you weren't there.
- What?

624
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:23,089
What is it? l can't wait.

625
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:25,675
And l hope
it involves party hats!

626
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:28,678
God's only son is going
to be born on earth

627
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:31,598
to help spread peace
to all mankind.

628
00:47:31,766 --> 00:47:34,851
Hats! l knew it.
lt's a birthday.

629
00:47:35,019 --> 00:47:37,646
And birthdays
always mean party hats.

630
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:42,192
You're supposed to be over at the Great
Hall helping the decorating committee.

631
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:46,947
Oh! And every one of the angels
in your academy are supposed

632
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:51,117
to prepare a special gift
for the baby Jesus!

633
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:53,745
Y-yes-- no!

634
00:47:53,913 --> 00:47:57,541
Oh, l'm ruined!
l may even lose my wings.

635
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:01,211
Oh, this is all his fault.

636
00:48:01,379 --> 00:48:03,880
Where on earth could he be?

637
00:48:04,048 --> 00:48:06,550
l don't know.
lt's a pretty big place.

638
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:09,469
Oh, don't be silly.
lt's just an expression.

639
00:48:09,637 --> 00:48:12,556
l mean, he couldn't have actually
jumped cloud and--

640
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:15,100
Ridiculous to even consider.

641
00:48:15,268 --> 00:48:16,810
Absolutely impossible--

642
00:48:16,978 --> 00:48:19,145
- l pray.

643
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:33,660
l think we lost him.

644
00:48:34,662 --> 00:48:37,497
Now l don't want to say
l'm an ace problem solver,

645
00:48:37,665 --> 00:48:40,667
but if good old King Solomon
ever needed advice,

646
00:48:40,835 --> 00:48:43,670
l'm definitely the dog to call.

647
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:52,178
Look out below-oooh!

648
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:57,142
Watch it! You almost--
my treasures!

649
00:48:57,310 --> 00:48:58,852
Did someone say treasure?

650
00:49:04,025 --> 00:49:06,901
- Mine!
- Thanks for catching my box, mister.

651
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:09,195
l don't know
what you're talking about.

652
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:11,865
This is my box.
Take a hike, kid.

653
00:49:12,033 --> 00:49:14,367
That's my box
and l can prove it.

654
00:49:14,535 --> 00:49:17,329
l said scram!
And take that mangy mutt with you.

655
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:27,714
What's going on here, Creepedeep?

656
00:49:27,882 --> 00:49:31,051
This kid and his vicious dog
tried to steal my box.

657
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:33,803
And l'm sure they snuck in
without buying a ticket.

658
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:36,306
ls that true?
You got a ticket?

659
00:49:36,474 --> 00:49:38,683
- No, but that's my box!
- Hit the road

660
00:49:38,851 --> 00:49:41,895
or l'll have to call the guard.
Guard! Guard!

661
00:49:42,063 --> 00:49:44,272
Guard?

662
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:47,734
But it's not fair.
He stole my box.

663
00:49:47,902 --> 00:49:50,945
l know, but nothing we can
do about it right now.

664
00:50:04,919 --> 00:50:07,754
Blast it!
There's no treasure here.

665
00:50:07,922 --> 00:50:11,508
No gold, no gems,
just a bunch of bric-a-brac.

666
00:50:11,676 --> 00:50:16,179
Well, that's what you get
for stealing from a poor little child.

667
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:20,767
Oh, like you'd care a rat's backside

668
00:50:20,935 --> 00:50:23,728
about the kid if there turned
out to be real treasure.

669
00:50:23,896 --> 00:50:26,606
Hmph, like you
could ever find a real treasure

670
00:50:26,774 --> 00:50:29,609
or a real attraction for that matter.

671
00:50:32,613 --> 00:50:34,114
Ehh.

672
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:39,869
lt just so happens
l'm onto something really big.

673
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:43,998
lt's going to make me rich as a king.

674
00:50:45,334 --> 00:50:47,961
lf l had a coin
for every time l heard that,

675
00:50:48,129 --> 00:50:49,879
l would be rich.

676
00:50:51,507 --> 00:50:54,342
Oh yeah?
Well, you just wait and see.

677
00:50:59,682 --> 00:51:02,267
Those two give me an itch.

678
00:51:02,435 --> 00:51:05,103
Well, at least we know
where the box is.

679
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:16,573
Now let's just try and stay awake
till they fall asleep.

680
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:30,837
Now let's just try and stay awake
till they fall asleep.

681
00:51:31,005 --> 00:51:32,005
Then what do we do?

682
00:51:32,173 --> 00:51:34,674
Trust me.
Those two Creepedeeps

683
00:51:34,842 --> 00:51:37,260
are more than a few arches
short of a cathedral,

684
00:51:37,428 --> 00:51:38,720
if you catch my drift.

685
00:51:38,888 --> 00:51:41,514
This'll be like taking
candy from a baby.

686
00:51:41,682 --> 00:51:45,143
Not that you'd know anything
about something like that.

687
00:51:45,311 --> 00:51:46,936
Right?

688
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:49,856
Me? Of course not.

689
00:51:50,024 --> 00:51:51,900
Hey, l got into heaven, didn't l?

690
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:55,695
You think every Tom, Dick and hairy mutt
gets through those pearly gates?

691
00:51:55,863 --> 00:51:57,864
l don't think so.

692
00:51:58,032 --> 00:52:00,992
No, l guess not.

693
00:52:03,621 --> 00:52:05,538
- Halo?
- Yeah?

694
00:52:06,749 --> 00:52:08,708
Did you have-- you know,

695
00:52:08,876 --> 00:52:12,378
- a boy or a girl back when you--
- No, l was on my own.

696
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:15,882
Fancy-free, living in the city,
nothing to tie me down.

697
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:18,426
Went where l wanted
and did what l wanted.

698
00:52:18,594 --> 00:52:20,887
Hmm, because
the Good Book says

699
00:52:21,055 --> 00:52:24,766
though one may be overpowered,
two can defend themselves.

700
00:52:24,934 --> 00:52:27,560
Oh, what are you Good Booking me
at this time of night for?

701
00:52:27,728 --> 00:52:29,771
Nothing.
l'm just saying

702
00:52:29,939 --> 00:52:33,107
it's really good to have
a friend you can count on.

703
00:52:41,534 --> 00:52:45,995
And when we get back to heaven,
l'm really gonna start trying harder.

704
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:50,625
Yeah, l know what you mean, Littlest.
l know what you mean.

705
00:53:13,148 --> 00:53:14,941
Looks like we're in luck.

706
00:53:25,369 --> 00:53:27,829
Look out.

707
00:53:27,997 --> 00:53:30,290
- Halo!
- Keep going, Littlest!

708
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:33,835
Better listen to the talking dog,
kid, and hit the road.

709
00:53:34,003 --> 00:53:36,629
l can't just leave you.

710
00:53:36,797 --> 00:53:38,089
Get going

711
00:53:38,257 --> 00:53:39,799
unless you want to feel my whip.

712
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:41,426
Save yourself, kid.

713
00:53:45,014 --> 00:53:47,390
Heh heh heh,
l knew you two were hiding

714
00:53:47,558 --> 00:53:49,976
something bigger than
that so-called treasure.

715
00:53:50,144 --> 00:53:52,645
But this is even better
than l dreamed.

716
00:53:52,813 --> 00:53:54,480
A talking dog!

717
00:53:54,648 --> 00:53:56,900
You're messing with
the wrong mongrel, mister.

718
00:53:57,067 --> 00:54:00,111
l'll go devil dog on you.

719
00:54:02,573 --> 00:54:06,034
- Why you--
- Save your stupid threats for the show.

720
00:54:07,036 --> 00:54:09,913
No way l'm leaving earth
without my best friend.

721
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:13,917
But what can l do all alone
against that big bully?

722
00:54:17,004 --> 00:54:19,756
What do you think
you're doing now?

723
00:54:19,924 --> 00:54:21,424
See this dog?

724
00:54:21,592 --> 00:54:25,053
This is the attraction
l've been waiting for my whole life.

725
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:27,221
l've heard that one before.

726
00:54:27,389 --> 00:54:31,017
Yeah? Well, you've never
heard a talking dog before.

727
00:54:31,185 --> 00:54:35,021
Hello!
l'm a talking chicken, remember?

728
00:54:35,189 --> 00:54:38,024
This isn't a fake.
This dog really talks.

729
00:54:38,192 --> 00:54:40,526
Just listen for once in your life.

730
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:43,112
Tell her.

731
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:47,325
Ugh.

732
00:54:47,493 --> 00:54:49,285
Amazing!

733
00:54:49,453 --> 00:54:51,871
He's talking in tongues.

734
00:54:52,039 --> 00:54:54,832
Talking dog, my foot!

735
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,085
Oh, Mother was right.

736
00:54:57,252 --> 00:54:59,379
l married a nincompoop.

737
00:55:01,507 --> 00:55:03,883
Talk, you miserable mutt,

738
00:55:04,051 --> 00:55:05,551
or l'll--

739
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:07,387
what?

740
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:09,555
What's going on?

741
00:55:09,723 --> 00:55:11,099
lt's working.

742
00:55:11,266 --> 00:55:14,602
Wha-- wha-- wha--
ho-- ho-- how?

743
00:55:23,737 --> 00:55:26,823
- Are you okay, Halo?
- Wait wait wait, are you talking to me

744
00:55:26,991 --> 00:55:28,866
- or the other halo?
- Both.

745
00:55:29,034 --> 00:55:31,369
Thanks.

746
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:34,539
We'd better blow this freak show.

747
00:55:34,707 --> 00:55:36,374
You've still got
your treasure box, right?

748
00:55:36,542 --> 00:55:37,917
lt's safe and sound.

749
00:55:38,085 --> 00:55:40,545
Then let's make wings
and flap for home.

750
00:55:43,757 --> 00:55:46,426
Littlest! Littlest!

751
00:55:46,593 --> 00:55:50,638
Now this is what l call
the greatest attraction on earth--

752
00:55:50,806 --> 00:55:53,099
a real live angel!

753
00:55:53,267 --> 00:55:55,059
Keep going, Halo!

754
00:55:55,227 --> 00:55:57,353
Don't stop
or they'll catch you too.

755
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,982
Huh? lt can't be.

756
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:04,944
A talking dog with wings.

757
00:56:06,071 --> 00:56:09,115
Uh-oh, l don't think
l can handle the two of them.

758
00:56:09,283 --> 00:56:12,535
Hey, he's getting away.
Do something.

759
00:56:12,703 --> 00:56:14,620
Oh, forget that mutt.

760
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:16,664
Quick, you'd better hide.

761
00:56:17,708 --> 00:56:20,293
l can't believe you just stood there

762
00:56:20,461 --> 00:56:22,128
while the fortune flew away.

763
00:56:22,296 --> 00:56:25,840
Who cares?
l just netted a gold mine.

764
00:56:30,262 --> 00:56:33,931
l bagged myself a real live angel.

765
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:36,392
Gee, l don't see any angel.

766
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:39,270
And no one else is ever
gonna see one either.

767
00:56:39,438 --> 00:56:42,899
Whoa! Hey, stop!

768
00:56:43,067 --> 00:56:45,151
Don't kid yourself, kid.

769
00:56:45,319 --> 00:56:48,821
You'll sprout those wings
the minute l order you to.

770
00:56:48,989 --> 00:56:52,408
l won't do it!
You don't scare me.

771
00:56:52,576 --> 00:56:55,995
Oh, l don't scare you, hmm?

772
00:56:56,163 --> 00:56:58,039
Well, why don't you ask them two

773
00:56:58,207 --> 00:57:00,833
what happens
when they disobey me?

774
00:57:01,001 --> 00:57:02,877
Bok bok bok bok bok.

775
00:57:03,045 --> 00:57:05,088
Oh, you'll pop those wings

776
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:08,508
or l'll find a way
to rip 'em out of you.

777
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:10,843
She's not that cruel.

778
00:57:11,011 --> 00:57:14,013
Or is she?

779
00:57:44,837 --> 00:57:49,048
Remember, my little angels,
place the gifts in an orderly pile.

780
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:51,050
- Oh!
- Oooh.

781
00:57:51,218 --> 00:57:52,593
- Outta my way.
- Ah!

782
00:57:52,761 --> 00:57:53,928
Coming through here.

783
00:57:54,096 --> 00:57:55,888
What is the meaning of-- ooof!

784
00:57:57,558 --> 00:58:01,352
Look, Alban, it's a doggy.
Here, doggy doggy.

785
00:58:03,355 --> 00:58:06,232
- ls he for real?
- Unfortunately.

786
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:09,777
How dare you barge
into the Great Hall and paw me?

787
00:58:09,945 --> 00:58:12,071
Hey, not my idea
of heaven either, pal.

788
00:58:12,239 --> 00:58:13,906
But your friend and my friend,

789
00:58:14,074 --> 00:58:16,909
the littlest angel, is
in big trouble back on earth.

790
00:58:17,077 --> 00:58:19,036
We have to rescue him
right now!

791
00:58:20,164 --> 00:58:22,582
- Alban?
- Oh dear, it's Angel Eve.

792
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:24,917
Logan, get this mutt out of here.

793
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:32,216
Fine, then l guess l'll just
have to tell my troubles to--

794
00:58:32,384 --> 00:58:35,928
oh, Angel Eve?

795
00:58:36,096 --> 00:58:37,096
Oh!

796
00:58:39,141 --> 00:58:43,311
Halo, no, she mustn't
know anything's wrong.

797
00:58:43,478 --> 00:58:45,521
Then you'd better help
save the littlest angel.

798
00:58:45,689 --> 00:58:47,106
Tick tock, time's running out.

799
00:58:47,274 --> 00:58:49,942
All right. Shhh.
Just keep your snout--

800
00:58:50,110 --> 00:58:51,611
Alban, did you call me?

801
00:58:51,778 --> 00:58:54,280
Me?!
No, definitely wasn't me.

802
00:58:54,448 --> 00:58:56,282
Logan and l were just
helping this dog

803
00:58:56,450 --> 00:58:58,284
find the way out out out!

804
00:59:05,459 --> 00:59:07,793
Hey, glands-for-brains,

805
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:09,295
- ya mind?
- Not at all.

806
00:59:09,463 --> 00:59:12,965
l'm quite strong, you know.
l could carry you all day.

807
00:59:13,133 --> 00:59:16,135
- Down, boy.
- Oh!

808
00:59:18,138 --> 00:59:20,139
All right, so what do you know

809
00:59:20,307 --> 00:59:23,309
about the whereabouts
of that little wing-tipped wonder?

810
00:59:23,477 --> 00:59:27,146
He's on earth near his old village
and rescuing him ain't gonna be easy.

811
00:59:27,314 --> 00:59:29,982
Alert the troops.
Let the battle begin.

812
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:33,778
Shush! Quiet!
No one can know what's happened.

813
00:59:33,946 --> 00:59:37,114
Even better!
A secret mission.

814
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:39,992
To battle!

815
00:59:43,914 --> 00:59:47,667
My, how l've missed having
a good cause to fight for.

816
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:49,252
Onward.

817
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:51,337
Er, downward.

818
01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:08,354
l really blew it this time.

819
01:00:08,522 --> 01:00:11,899
All l wanted was my special box
to remind me of home.

820
01:00:12,067 --> 01:00:16,570
But now l've lost the best friend
l ever had

821
01:00:16,738 --> 01:00:18,364
and l'm all alone.

822
01:00:18,532 --> 01:00:23,035
No offense, but l really miss Halo.

823
01:00:26,373 --> 01:00:28,708
But l've still got my other halo!

824
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:31,043
l hope.

825
01:00:31,211 --> 01:00:33,754
Thank heaven you're still here.

826
01:00:33,922 --> 01:00:37,049
Let's see
if you like playing fetch too.

827
01:00:40,345 --> 01:00:42,888
That's it!
You got the key.

828
01:00:43,056 --> 01:00:46,225
And l've got my box.

829
01:00:46,393 --> 01:00:49,437
Thanks. You're the best.

830
01:00:51,773 --> 01:00:53,816
Bok. Bok bok.

831
01:00:54,943 --> 01:00:57,778
- Come on, let's get out of--
- Bok bok!

832
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:02,283
- Bok bok bok bok.
- Sorry, there's no time.

833
01:01:02,451 --> 01:01:04,952
Bok bok bok bok.

834
01:01:12,711 --> 01:01:16,547
But l can't leave you
with those cruel Creepedeeps.

835
01:01:17,883 --> 01:01:20,092
Stop, grab him!

836
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:22,511
Bok bok bok!

837
01:01:26,266 --> 01:01:29,643
- Too late.
- You grab that kid.

838
01:01:29,811 --> 01:01:32,146
Whoa.

839
01:01:38,779 --> 01:01:40,112
- Stop him!
- Stop! Grab him!

840
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:41,947
Come back here.

841
01:01:44,242 --> 01:01:46,994
Don't let him get away.

842
01:01:49,206 --> 01:01:53,167
l can't use my wings
without really breaking the rules.

843
01:01:53,335 --> 01:01:56,420
Don't let him get away!

844
01:01:57,756 --> 01:01:59,465
- Faster.
- You grab that kid.

845
01:01:59,633 --> 01:02:02,468
- Don't let him get away.
- Just gotta get my wings and--

846
01:02:02,636 --> 01:02:04,512
uh-oh.

847
01:02:04,679 --> 01:02:07,223
- Don't let him get away.
- After him.

848
01:02:10,185 --> 01:02:11,977
- Cut him off.
- Grab that kid.

849
01:02:17,859 --> 01:02:20,319
Where is the miniature
mischief-maker?

850
01:02:21,988 --> 01:02:25,199
Oh now--

851
01:02:32,457 --> 01:02:34,125
He says
they went thattaway.

852
01:02:39,339 --> 01:02:41,799
Whoa whoa!

853
01:02:50,725 --> 01:02:53,018
- Come back here.
- Hey hey, stop him.

854
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:13,289
Gotcha!

855
01:03:20,380 --> 01:03:22,173
Whoa!

856
01:03:27,512 --> 01:03:29,555
Back off, buster.

857
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:33,434
Ha ha ha! You?

858
01:03:33,602 --> 01:03:35,895
Gonna stop me?

859
01:03:37,397 --> 01:03:41,442
- Wimp.
- We'll see who the wimp is here.

860
01:03:41,610 --> 01:03:43,402
Show him, Logan.

861
01:03:44,571 --> 01:03:46,739
Hey, put me down.

862
01:03:48,033 --> 01:03:51,035
Mama!

863
01:03:51,203 --> 01:03:53,412
Get ready to meet your maker.

864
01:04:02,005 --> 01:04:03,172
Uh-oh.

865
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:11,972
Thank you. Thank you.
l can do two shows a night

866
01:04:12,140 --> 01:04:15,684
- with a matinee on Saturday.
- Hello, anyone in there?

867
01:04:15,852 --> 01:04:19,939
This is no time for theatrics.
We've got to get back to you-know-where.

868
01:04:20,106 --> 01:04:22,816
Ooops, sorry.
Previous engagement calls.

869
01:04:22,984 --> 01:04:25,611
But how can we fly
with everyone staring at us?

870
01:04:27,447 --> 01:04:30,574
- Follow me.
- l do not take orders from--

871
01:04:30,742 --> 01:04:33,285
oh, what the heck.

872
01:04:41,545 --> 01:04:44,463
He wants to ride
the Ferris wheel now.

873
01:04:44,631 --> 01:04:47,383
Oh goody!

874
01:04:51,555 --> 01:04:55,307
You two get in this one.
Halo and l will take the next one.

875
01:04:55,475 --> 01:04:58,227
Don't be ridiculous.
Ah! What are you doing?

876
01:05:00,355 --> 01:05:03,315
Who can turn down a free ride?

877
01:05:07,529 --> 01:05:09,655
Get ready, Halo.

878
01:05:12,325 --> 01:05:14,660
Jump!

879
01:05:18,164 --> 01:05:21,667
We've got them now!

880
01:05:21,835 --> 01:05:25,504
Si. We grab them as soon
as they swing back down.

881
01:05:29,968 --> 01:05:33,178
Gee, we're up so high no one
can even see us way up here.

882
01:05:33,346 --> 01:05:35,848
Oh, that's it.

883
01:05:36,016 --> 01:05:39,351
We can sprout our wings now
without breaking the rules.

884
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:44,690
lmpossible.

885
01:05:44,858 --> 01:05:46,734
They're all empty.

886
01:05:46,901 --> 01:05:49,028
They couldn't just fly away.

887
01:05:49,195 --> 01:05:51,238
l don't care where they went...

888
01:05:51,406 --> 01:05:54,783
...but you two are out of here.

889
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:59,705
You troublemakers are leaving
this traveling show right now.

890
01:05:59,873 --> 01:06:01,707
Wait wait, you don't understand.

891
01:06:01,875 --> 01:06:03,542
Give us one more chance.

892
01:06:03,710 --> 01:06:07,212
And don't ever come back.

893
01:06:08,214 --> 01:06:10,174
Arrivederci.

894
01:06:12,385 --> 01:06:14,511
Take that, you halfwit.

895
01:06:26,650 --> 01:06:30,486
Wow, l can't believe
you all came just to rescue me.

896
01:06:30,654 --> 01:06:32,738
What are heroes for, Littlest?

897
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:57,846
Oh, it's good to be back
on solid clouds again.

898
01:06:58,014 --> 01:07:02,643
So how about showing us what's
so important about that box of yours?

899
01:07:02,811 --> 01:07:05,771
- Sure thing.
- Ahem.

900
01:07:05,939 --> 01:07:09,650
l mean, if it's all right
with my headmaster.

901
01:07:09,818 --> 01:07:13,153
Goodness. Are we sure
we have the right angel?

902
01:07:13,321 --> 01:07:16,448
l know l haven't acted
much like a real angel--

903
01:07:16,616 --> 01:07:19,660
just thinking about what
would make me happy

904
01:07:19,828 --> 01:07:22,663
and not realizing l was putting
all my friends in danger.

905
01:07:22,831 --> 01:07:24,540
But from now on

906
01:07:24,708 --> 01:07:28,001
l'm going to be
the best-behaved angel ever.

907
01:07:28,169 --> 01:07:31,130
So can l, please?

908
01:07:31,297 --> 01:07:34,174
Uh, "May l?" and all right.

909
01:07:34,342 --> 01:07:36,635
Then let's see
what we risked our wings for.

910
01:07:36,803 --> 01:07:38,929
Okay, here goes.

911
01:07:47,939 --> 01:07:50,357
Aren't they just the greatest?

912
01:07:51,401 --> 01:07:53,026
- Yes yes.
- They're...

913
01:07:53,194 --> 01:07:55,404
- real nice. Yeah well.
- lnteresting.

914
01:07:55,572 --> 01:07:57,740
- You don't like them?
- lt's not that.

915
01:07:57,907 --> 01:08:01,201
lt's just every great treasure
has a story.

916
01:08:01,369 --> 01:08:03,287
l guess we need to hear yours.

917
01:08:03,455 --> 01:08:06,165
Of course,
the legend of the treasure.

918
01:08:06,332 --> 01:08:07,791
Oh, do tell!

919
01:08:07,959 --> 01:08:11,336
Well, this is a rock
from the banks of the river

920
01:08:11,504 --> 01:08:15,174
where l used to swim
and play with all my friends.

921
01:08:15,341 --> 01:08:19,303
And once l found this nest
in a tree just outside my window.

922
01:08:19,471 --> 01:08:23,682
So l got to watch the eggs hatch
and the baby birds grow up and fly off.

923
01:08:23,850 --> 01:08:26,435
l wonder if they had
as much trouble

924
01:08:26,603 --> 01:08:28,479
getting used to their wings.

925
01:08:28,646 --> 01:08:30,689
Anyway, when the nest
was empty,

926
01:08:30,857 --> 01:08:33,567
l found this beautiful
butterfly inside.

927
01:08:33,735 --> 01:08:35,694
lts spirit had already gone.

928
01:08:35,862 --> 01:08:38,572
lt's not like l--
well, you know.

929
01:08:38,740 --> 01:08:41,033
- Nay nay, never.
- Heaven forbid.

930
01:08:41,201 --> 01:08:44,369
And this string was
on my favorite kite and it got loose

931
01:08:44,537 --> 01:08:48,791
and flew so high, l imagined it must
have gone all the way up to heaven.

932
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:52,294
Hmm, remind me to check
the heavenly lost and found

933
01:08:52,462 --> 01:08:54,421
when we get back
to Celestial City.

934
01:08:54,589 --> 01:08:57,966
And this belonged to
my first best friend,

935
01:08:58,134 --> 01:09:00,719
my old dog.

936
01:09:00,887 --> 01:09:04,389
No doubt about it--
the best treasures l ever saw.

937
01:09:04,557 --> 01:09:08,060
And now you won't have to be
sad anymore missing earth.

938
01:09:08,228 --> 01:09:10,771
No way.
l have all the best stuff

939
01:09:10,939 --> 01:09:14,441
right here with me
forever and ever.

940
01:09:14,609 --> 01:09:19,071
You'll see, Headmaster.
l'm going to make you proud of me.

We mustn't dally, angels.

955
01:11:41,839 --> 01:11:45,092
lt's nearly time
for the big event.

956
01:11:45,259 --> 01:11:46,593
What big event?

957
01:11:46,761 --> 01:11:49,429
A lot's gone on here
since you left, Littlest.

958
01:11:49,597 --> 01:11:54,476
God is sending his only son Jesus
as a savior for all mankind.

959
01:11:54,644 --> 01:11:57,229
Hurry hurry, gather up
your gifts for the Lord

960
01:11:57,397 --> 01:11:59,523
and meet in the Great Hall.

961
01:12:01,567 --> 01:12:03,068
- Gifts?
- Of course.

962
01:12:03,236 --> 01:12:05,612
lt's Jesus's birthday, after all.

963
01:12:05,780 --> 01:12:08,240
The very first Christmas.

964
01:12:08,408 --> 01:12:10,075
Gee, Halo, where am l going to find

965
01:12:10,243 --> 01:12:12,911
a present nice enough
to give to God's son?

966
01:12:14,914 --> 01:12:17,124
Come on.
We don't have much time,

967
01:12:17,291 --> 01:12:21,253
but maybe we can track down
something really special.

968
01:12:32,765 --> 01:12:34,933
Oh oh.

969
01:12:57,957 --> 01:13:02,210
lt's no use, Halo.
We searched all over heaven

970
01:13:02,378 --> 01:13:06,631
and l couldn't find anything
nice enough to give God's only son.

971
01:13:06,799 --> 01:13:09,676
Lucky for us dogs,
we're just born joy-givers.

972
01:13:09,844 --> 01:13:12,596
So we don't have to come up
with actual presents.

973
01:13:13,723 --> 01:13:18,310
Wow! Look at all
those priceless treasures.

974
01:13:20,313 --> 01:13:22,939
That's it, Halo!

975
01:13:27,653 --> 01:13:31,656
l'm sure God's little boy is gonna
love them just as much as me.

976
01:13:36,245 --> 01:13:38,163
Oh no no no no no.

977
01:13:38,331 --> 01:13:42,375
What will God think
when he sees that box of old junk?

978
01:13:42,543 --> 01:13:44,628
- Junk?
- Well, l'm sorry,

979
01:13:44,796 --> 01:13:46,922
but honesty is the best policy

980
01:13:47,090 --> 01:13:50,509
and it's just not suitable for--

981
01:13:50,676 --> 01:13:53,136
Oh dear, this is it.

982
01:13:53,304 --> 01:13:55,680
Every angel, places please.

983
01:14:04,357 --> 01:14:06,691
Halo, what am l gonna do?

984
01:14:06,859 --> 01:14:11,238
Alban's right. My box is
just a bunch of old junk.

985
01:14:11,405 --> 01:14:15,242
l just have to get it back
before God sees it.

986
01:14:24,544 --> 01:14:26,378
lt's now or never.

987
01:14:38,141 --> 01:14:42,227
Littlest Angel,
what are you doing?

988
01:14:46,232 --> 01:14:48,066
Um, l-- er,

989
01:14:48,234 --> 01:14:49,943
made a mistake, Lord.

990
01:14:50,111 --> 01:14:52,612
l gave a gift, but then

991
01:14:52,780 --> 01:14:56,533
l realized it's not nearly
a nice enough gift for your son.

992
01:14:58,244 --> 01:15:01,580
l mean, l know it probably
just looks like old junk

993
01:15:01,747 --> 01:15:04,249
next to all the magnificent gifts.

994
01:15:04,417 --> 01:15:07,377
But to me
they're the best treasures ever.

995
01:15:07,545 --> 01:15:10,505
That poor little guy.

996
01:15:10,673 --> 01:15:14,342
l warned him. You all heard me.
No one can blame me.

997
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:17,304
Uh, can they?

998
01:15:28,107 --> 01:15:32,068
Wow!

999
01:15:43,623 --> 01:15:47,083
The littlest angel
gave the things he cherished most.

1000
01:15:47,251 --> 01:15:50,754
What greater gift
could there ever be?

1001
01:15:50,922 --> 01:15:55,634
This box filled with a child's
pure joy and wonder

1002
01:15:55,801 --> 01:15:59,554
shall forever be a beacon
to light the way...

1003
01:16:02,308 --> 01:16:04,476
known to one and all

1004
01:16:04,644 --> 01:16:07,354
as the Star of Bethlehem.

1005
01:16:08,898 --> 01:16:12,567
- You did it!
- Way to go, little guy.

1006
01:16:12,735 --> 01:16:15,111
- l knew you had it in you.
- Sweet little thing.

1007
01:16:16,822 --> 01:16:18,573
Did you see that, Alban?

1008
01:16:18,741 --> 01:16:22,285
Littlest Angel is
our very own shining star.

1009
01:16:22,453 --> 01:16:25,413
Amazing!

1010
01:16:25,581 --> 01:16:28,083
lndeed.
Today the littlest angel proved

1011
01:16:28,251 --> 01:16:30,335
that he's ready to begin traveling

1012
01:16:30,503 --> 01:16:33,505
to earth as a Junior Angel-in-training.

1013
01:16:33,673 --> 01:16:36,591
What? But he hasn't performed
his three good deeds.

1014
01:16:36,759 --> 01:16:39,970
- But he has, indeed.
- l have?

1015
01:16:41,764 --> 01:16:45,350
Littlest chose to help the bull

1016
01:16:45,518 --> 01:16:47,894
even after it had
been so mean to him.

1017
01:16:53,067 --> 01:16:57,028
Littlest risked his own freedom

1018
01:16:57,196 --> 01:16:59,698
to save these two
helpless creatures.

1019
01:17:01,033 --> 01:17:02,701
Too late.

1020
01:17:02,868 --> 01:17:04,536
You grab that kid.

1021
01:17:05,538 --> 01:17:07,956
l guess l see
how those were good deeds.

1022
01:17:08,124 --> 01:17:10,542
But that's only two.
What's the third?

1023
01:17:10,710 --> 01:17:13,712
- Oh oh, l know, l know!
- Yes, Logan?

1024
01:17:13,879 --> 01:17:16,881
When the littlest angel gave away
his beloved treasures

1025
01:17:17,049 --> 01:17:19,301
to bring joy to another child.

1026
01:17:31,772 --> 01:17:33,481
My wings!

1027
01:17:33,649 --> 01:17:35,483
Your heavenly reward

1028
01:17:35,651 --> 01:17:38,570
for performing
three very good deeds.

1029
01:17:38,738 --> 01:17:41,031
l sure have learned a lot today

1030
01:17:41,198 --> 01:17:45,201
about real friendship
and human kindness

1031
01:17:45,369 --> 01:17:47,620
and forgiveness.

1032
01:17:47,788 --> 01:17:50,415
Yes well, it seems we've all
seen the light today.

1033
01:17:52,168 --> 01:17:55,462
And now it's time for you
to spread God's eternal light,

1034
01:17:55,629 --> 01:17:58,798
helping humanity to feel His love.

1035
01:17:58,966 --> 01:18:01,426
Does that mean
what l think it means?

1036
01:18:01,594 --> 01:18:04,054
Yes, my littlest angel,
from now on

1037
01:18:04,221 --> 01:18:07,474
you will be traveling to earth
to perform more good deeds.

1038
01:18:07,641 --> 01:18:11,603
But of course you will need
an older angel to guide you.

1039
01:18:11,771 --> 01:18:15,940
So, Alban, you have been chosen
to be there to help him

1040
01:18:16,108 --> 01:18:19,069
every step of the way.

1041
01:18:19,236 --> 01:18:22,614
Me?
Oh, heaven help me.
