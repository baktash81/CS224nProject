1
00:00:29,544 --> 00:00:33,048
<i>It's been the same dream
every night for months now.</i>

2
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,888
<i>I can't ever see her
face, but I know her.</i>

3
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:41,190
<i>Like I've known her all my life.</i>

4
00:00:41,192 --> 00:00:43,993
<i>And it feels like something
terrible is gonna happen</i>

5
00:00:43,995 --> 00:00:45,528
<i>when I reach her.</i>

6
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:49,064
<i>But at the same time,
I'm not scared at all.</i>

7
00:00:49,066 --> 00:00:50,900
<i>I want her...</i>

8
00:00:50,902 --> 00:00:52,935
<i>No matter what happens.</i>

9
00:00:52,937 --> 00:00:54,603
<i>But I never get to her.</i>

10
00:00:54,605 --> 00:00:55,672
<i>And then I die.</i>

11
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:03,045
<i>At first I was scared
I was losing my mind...</i>

12
00:01:03,047 --> 00:01:04,947
<i>Till I realized that
would be no great loss.</i>

13
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:10,085
<i>I start junior year tomorrow,
so insanity is inevitable.</i>

14
00:01:10,087 --> 00:01:13,322
<i>What's worse is waking up every night</i>

15
00:01:13,324 --> 00:01:16,158
<i>wanting someone I've never met,</i>

16
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:20,396
<i>loving a girl who doesn't exist.</i>

17
00:01:33,443 --> 00:01:36,712
<i>I've been stuck my whole life in Gatlin,</i>

18
00:01:36,714 --> 00:01:39,348
<i>South Carolina's least-famous
middle-of-nowhere.</i>

19
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:42,218
<i>By the time we get a
movie, it's already on DVD.</i>

20
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:45,688
<i>And our theater always
gets the titles wrong.</i>

21
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:49,558
<i>We're too far away from
Charleston to have a Starbucks.</i>

22
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,228
<i>How sick is that?</i>

23
00:01:59,002 --> 00:02:01,770
<i>We have 12 churches and one library,</i>

24
00:02:01,772 --> 00:02:04,640
<i>with more banned books
than books to read.</i>

25
00:02:04,642 --> 00:02:08,143
<i>Same damn families have
lived here for generations.</i>

26
00:02:08,145 --> 00:02:09,612
<i>They keep reenacting the Civil War</i>

27
00:02:09,614 --> 00:02:11,747
<i>like it's gonna turn out different.</i>

28
00:02:11,749 --> 00:02:13,282
<i>Mama used to say</i>

29
00:02:13,284 --> 00:02:15,584
<i>there's only two kinds
of people in Gatlin --</i>

30
00:02:15,586 --> 00:02:20,189
<i>The ones too stupid to leave
and the ones too stuck to move.</i>

31
00:02:22,259 --> 00:02:25,094
<i>Dad can't leave his room since she died.</i>

32
00:02:25,096 --> 00:02:27,897
<i>People said it was god's will.</i>

33
00:02:27,899 --> 00:02:31,400
<i>I think it's the only way
people ever get out of here.</i>

34
00:02:31,402 --> 00:02:36,238
<i>I can understand why young men
signed up for the Civil War.</i>

35
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,608
<i>Anything is better than
a life standing still.</i>

36
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:51,086
<i>But I think even the
dead stay in Gatlin.</i>

37
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:52,755
<i>Sometimes it sounds crazy,</i>

38
00:02:52,757 --> 00:02:55,691
<i>but sometimes I imagine I'm one of them,</i>

39
00:02:55,693 --> 00:02:58,994
<i>fighting for the cause on
Honey Hill near greenbrier.</i>

40
00:02:59,296 --> 00:03:00,996
Ethan!

41
00:03:25,221 --> 00:03:29,158
<i>I imagine all kinds of things lately.</i>

42
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,093
<i>Sometimes...</i>

43
00:03:31,095 --> 00:03:32,728
<i>I'm Billy Pilgrim,</i>

44
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:35,898
<i>from Vonnegut's banned
book "Slaughterhouse-Five."</i>

45
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,466
<i>"to be unstuck in time,</i>

46
00:03:37,468 --> 00:03:40,069
<i>"in a constant state of stage fright,</i>

47
00:03:40,071 --> 00:03:44,807
<i>never knowing what part of my
life I'd have to act in next."</i>

48
00:03:44,809 --> 00:03:47,176
<i>I just love the sound of that.</i>

49
00:03:49,346 --> 00:03:51,914
Dad?

50
00:03:51,916 --> 00:03:54,750
Dad?

51
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:58,153
I got breakfast.

52
00:04:03,561 --> 00:04:07,162
Is this what we're wearing
our first day of school?

53
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:08,530
I'm a junior now, Amma.

54
00:04:08,532 --> 00:04:11,600
If I dress like I care,
I lose credibility.

55
00:04:11,602 --> 00:04:13,869
I thought you were getting a haircut.

56
00:04:13,871 --> 00:04:15,771
- Who said that?
- I did.

57
00:04:15,773 --> 00:04:19,141
Pay attention to the days
marked on these containers.

58
00:04:19,143 --> 00:04:20,409
Thanks, Amma.

59
00:04:20,411 --> 00:04:22,111
You decide what colleges
you're applying to?

60
00:04:22,113 --> 00:04:23,545
All of them,

61
00:04:23,547 --> 00:04:25,581
as long as they're a
thousand miles away from here.

62
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:26,882
Amen to that.

63
00:04:26,884 --> 00:04:28,584
You go running last night?

64
00:04:28,586 --> 00:04:29,618
Yeah.

65
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:30,819
Help you sleep any?

66
00:04:30,821 --> 00:04:33,389
I envy people in comas.

67
00:04:33,391 --> 00:04:35,791
Your father come out at all?

68
00:04:35,793 --> 00:04:38,660
No.

69
00:04:38,662 --> 00:04:40,629
...22.

70
00:04:40,631 --> 00:04:43,699
"lying lips are abomination to the lord.

71
00:04:43,701 --> 00:04:48,137
"now, when a wicked man dies,
his expectation shall perish;

72
00:04:48,139 --> 00:04:52,174
And the hope of unjust men perisheth."

73
00:04:52,176 --> 00:04:53,976
- Ow! Mom!
- You get away now!

74
00:04:53,978 --> 00:04:55,177
Go on!

75
00:04:55,179 --> 00:04:56,378
Come on. I got to take him to school.

76
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,613
Well, we have to finish these now.

77
00:04:57,615 --> 00:04:58,947
Well, come on. You
know what happens --

78
00:04:58,949 --> 00:05:00,549
We'll do them tonight.

79
00:05:00,551 --> 00:05:02,951
Wesley, where are you going
without kissing your mother?

80
00:05:02,953 --> 00:05:05,320
What is wrong with you, boy, hey?

81
00:05:05,322 --> 00:05:07,723
Now, you be good.

82
00:05:07,725 --> 00:05:10,526
- So, is she a good kisser or what?
- Shut up!

83
00:05:10,528 --> 00:05:13,262
My mother has officially
flown that extra bat-shit mile

84
00:05:13,264 --> 00:05:14,663
Since dad died.

85
00:05:14,665 --> 00:05:16,665
And now she thinks the
end of the world is coming

86
00:05:16,667 --> 00:05:18,500
'Cause of all these
earthquakes in the news.

87
00:05:18,502 --> 00:05:21,537
It's like, how does loving
Jesus make that woman so crazy?

88
00:05:22,673 --> 00:05:24,573
You know, she damned daddy
to hell so many times,

89
00:05:24,575 --> 00:05:26,475
I bet you he drank just
so he'd get there quicker.

90
00:05:26,477 --> 00:05:28,811
My dad is acting like old man Ravenwood.

91
00:05:28,813 --> 00:05:30,479
They're all bat-shit.

92
00:05:30,481 --> 00:05:33,482
Hey, did you hear that new girl
in our class is a Ravenwood?

93
00:05:33,484 --> 00:05:36,385
I thought old man Ravenwood
lived in that house all alone.

94
00:05:36,387 --> 00:05:38,053
Yeah, he did, but it's
his niece from out of town.

95
00:05:38,055 --> 00:05:39,288
She just moved here.

96
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:40,689
Why would anyone want to move here?

97
00:05:40,691 --> 00:05:41,957
I don't know.

98
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:43,959
It'll be the first Ravenwood
anybody in Gatlin's seen

99
00:05:43,961 --> 00:05:45,761
in almost 20 years.

100
00:05:47,898 --> 00:05:50,199
How was your summer, sugar?

101
00:05:50,201 --> 00:05:52,768
Fine, Emily. And yours?

102
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:54,103
Wonderful.

103
00:05:54,105 --> 00:05:56,371
Why didn't you go to
the labor day carnival?

104
00:05:56,373 --> 00:05:57,773
It was such a good time.

105
00:05:57,775 --> 00:05:59,575
I wasn't up for it.

106
00:05:59,577 --> 00:06:03,045
I don't...understand what's happened.

107
00:06:03,047 --> 00:06:04,480
I know you don't.

108
00:06:04,482 --> 00:06:05,581
I'm sorry.

109
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:08,350
You said to give you
the summer, and I did.

110
00:06:08,352 --> 00:06:12,688
I didn't hear from you
once, but I was a good girl.

111
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:14,156
I didn't call.

112
00:06:14,158 --> 00:06:16,058
But I missed you.

113
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:19,862
Hey, no big deal, right?

114
00:06:19,864 --> 00:06:22,664
How's about you and I go
see a movie or something?

115
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:23,565
Just us.

116
00:06:23,567 --> 00:06:25,267
Oh, that would be just heaven.

117
00:06:25,269 --> 00:06:26,236
Sure.

118
00:06:27,238 --> 00:06:29,638
Everyone, take your seats.

119
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,907
Ethan, baby, I really
wish you'd quit reading

120
00:06:31,909 --> 00:06:33,041
those kind of books.

121
00:06:33,043 --> 00:06:34,576
They're bad for your mind.

122
00:06:41,417 --> 00:06:44,453
As a requirement of this course,

123
00:06:44,455 --> 00:06:47,856
you will need to select
a topic for a term paper

124
00:06:47,858 --> 00:06:51,527
based on materials covered
in chapters 12 to 24.

125
00:06:51,529 --> 00:06:52,728
Is that her?

126
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:54,596
Must be. What is she wearing?

127
00:06:54,598 --> 00:06:58,167
She looks like death eating a cracker.

128
00:06:58,169 --> 00:07:01,703
Just take any seat, miss, uh, uh...

129
00:07:01,705 --> 00:07:04,072
Ravenwood.

130
00:07:04,074 --> 00:07:05,440
Isn't it?

131
00:07:05,442 --> 00:07:07,843
Mama says nobody's
seen old man Ravenwood

132
00:07:07,845 --> 00:07:09,678
leave that creepy house in years.

133
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,181
Mama says it's 'cause
he's a devil worshiper.

134
00:07:12,183 --> 00:07:13,715
Actually, it's Duchannes.

135
00:07:13,717 --> 00:07:18,153
Well, uh, now, that's
an out-and-out lie.

136
00:07:18,155 --> 00:07:19,688
I happen to know for a fact

137
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,790
that you're Macon Ravenwood's niece.

138
00:07:21,792 --> 00:07:25,127
Well, bless your heart, sugar.

139
00:07:25,129 --> 00:07:28,096
You must have been first in your litter.

140
00:07:29,967 --> 00:07:33,669
Mama says devil
worshipers hate fresh air.

141
00:07:33,671 --> 00:07:34,836
Makes them choke.

142
00:07:34,838 --> 00:07:37,072
Well, we all know what makes <i>you</i> choke.

143
00:07:37,074 --> 00:07:38,774
That's enough, Mr. Lincoln.

144
00:07:38,776 --> 00:07:41,443
And that hat's gonna
look nice on my cat.

145
00:07:41,445 --> 00:07:42,911
He's such a fool!

146
00:07:42,913 --> 00:07:44,379
This year,

147
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:47,249
you will participate in
the annual reenactment

148
00:07:47,251 --> 00:07:53,722
of our glorious victory:
the Battle of Honey Hill.

149
00:07:53,724 --> 00:07:54,523
Ethan?

150
00:07:54,525 --> 00:07:55,924
The reenactment will be held

151
00:07:55,926 --> 00:07:58,994
on the day of the
battle, December the 21st.

152
00:07:58,996 --> 00:08:01,630
Even though that is the
middle of Christmas break,

153
00:08:01,632 --> 00:08:05,901
you will be expected to
participate wholeheartedly.

What were you doing
standing in the damn road?!

166
00:08:29,393 --> 00:08:31,927
I need help, genius!

167
00:08:31,929 --> 00:08:33,295
Forget it!

168
00:08:33,297 --> 00:08:35,097
Wait, wait, wait!

169
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:37,032
I'm sorry! Look, get in!

170
00:08:37,034 --> 00:08:39,901
This is a-- this is a shortcut.
Nobody comes down this road.

171
00:08:39,903 --> 00:08:42,738
You'll drow-- is this
old man Ravenwood's car?

172
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:44,940
You're one of them,
aren't you? What are you?

173
00:08:44,942 --> 00:08:49,845
The all-American jock
star, prom king...jock?

174
00:08:49,847 --> 00:08:52,547
Look, can you insult me in the car?

175
00:08:52,549 --> 00:08:55,951
It's getting a little
"titanic" out here.

176
00:08:58,554 --> 00:09:01,690
You know, I never understood
why Leo had to die in the end.

177
00:09:01,692 --> 00:09:03,358
Like, why couldn't they take turns?

178
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,327
"you float on the
wooden thingy 10 minutes,

179
00:09:05,329 --> 00:09:07,296
I'll float on the wooden
thingy 10 minutes."

180
00:09:07,298 --> 00:09:08,964
She kept saying, "I'll never let you go,

181
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:11,266
I'll never let you go,"
and then she lets him go!

182
00:09:11,268 --> 00:09:12,801
If I get in the car,

183
00:09:12,803 --> 00:09:15,070
will there be more of this
fascinating conversation?

184
00:09:15,072 --> 00:09:16,571
'Cause I'd rather drown.

185
00:09:22,845 --> 00:09:24,846
No. I got groceries back there.

186
00:09:24,848 --> 00:09:28,050
I can't believe you told
me the ending to "titanic."

187
00:09:28,052 --> 00:09:29,818
You've never seen it?

188
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,453
No.

189
00:09:32,789 --> 00:09:35,457
You really are from outta town.

190
00:09:40,296 --> 00:09:43,198
Hey.

191
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,966
Thanks.

192
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:49,338
You know where you're going?

193
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,107
Rarely.

194
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:56,044
Hey, I'm sorry about
those clichés in class,

195
00:09:56,046 --> 00:09:57,179
but I'm not one of them.

196
00:09:57,181 --> 00:09:58,313
"clichés"?

197
00:09:58,315 --> 00:09:59,881
"girls who once were human,

198
00:09:59,883 --> 00:10:02,951
but for whom absolute popularity
has corrupted absolutely."

199
00:10:02,953 --> 00:10:05,687
Mm, bet you're real proud of
yourself thinking that one up.

200
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:08,824
You probably dated one of them.

201
00:10:09,826 --> 00:10:11,560
You cut Emily like a surgeon.

202
00:10:11,562 --> 00:10:13,528
Years working with the bitch virus.

203
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:14,696
No cure yet, huh?

204
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:16,298
We continue to research and hope.

205
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,867
- You been to a lot of schools?
- Yeah.

206
00:10:19,169 --> 00:10:21,470
That must be nice. I
only ever lived here.

207
00:10:21,472 --> 00:10:22,471
Must be nice.

208
00:10:24,641 --> 00:10:26,575
So, where you all lived?

209
00:10:26,577 --> 00:10:29,711
Pretty much every state
that seceded from the union.

210
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:32,748
Moved around since I was
4, after my parents died.

211
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,649
I only have my dad. My
mom died last spring.

212
00:10:34,651 --> 00:10:35,984
How did it happen?

213
00:10:36,986 --> 00:10:38,053
Fire.

214
00:10:38,055 --> 00:10:40,622
Car accident.

215
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:44,092
That
was --

216
00:10:44,094 --> 00:10:47,696
That was a dead-end conversation
on a road going nowhere.

217
00:10:47,698 --> 00:10:50,832
I must have missed the
exit to "fascinating."

218
00:10:53,102 --> 00:10:55,237
You, uh...

219
00:10:55,239 --> 00:10:57,906
Bukowski? He-- he any good?

220
00:10:59,442 --> 00:11:01,510
Define "good."

221
00:11:06,883 --> 00:11:09,017
I can drive you up to
the house if you like.

222
00:11:09,019 --> 00:11:10,886
- No. This is fine.
- No. I don't mind.

223
00:11:10,888 --> 00:11:13,321
Look, I appreciate the ride,

224
00:11:13,323 --> 00:11:16,892
but I don't feel like being a
haunted house attraction today.

225
00:11:16,894 --> 00:11:20,295
No, I-- that's fairly
rude and not true at all.

226
00:11:20,297 --> 00:11:23,365
Perhaps it's because we haven't
been properly introduced.

227
00:11:23,367 --> 00:11:25,267
I'm Ethan Wate, by the way.

228
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:26,968
You're Ethan Wate?

229
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:28,136
Yeah.

230
00:11:28,138 --> 00:11:31,106
Oh, my god. You mean
Ethan Wate drove me home?

231
00:11:31,108 --> 00:11:32,307
You've heard of me?

232
00:11:32,309 --> 00:11:33,842
No.

233
00:11:34,845 --> 00:11:37,212
I like your charm necklace.

234
00:11:37,214 --> 00:11:39,014
And-- and
your tat, too.

235
00:11:39,016 --> 00:11:41,550
I mean, uh, also.

236
00:11:41,552 --> 00:11:43,118
Thanks.

237
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:48,857
<i>"some people never go crazy.</i>

238
00:11:48,859 --> 00:11:52,294
<i>"what truly horrible
lives they must live.</i>

239
00:11:52,296 --> 00:11:54,129
<i>"boring damned people.</i>

240
00:11:54,131 --> 00:11:55,564
<i>"all over the earth.</i>

241
00:11:55,566 --> 00:11:58,500
<i>"propagating more boring damned people.</i>

242
00:11:58,502 --> 00:11:59,968
<i>"what a horror show.</i>

243
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:04,206
The earth swarmed with them..."

244
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:07,642
This man is a god.

245
00:12:27,129 --> 00:12:29,631
It is the name of our lord

246
00:12:29,633 --> 00:12:31,633
that brings salvation.

247
00:12:31,635 --> 00:12:33,201
It is the name of Jesus

248
00:12:33,203 --> 00:12:36,438
that gives us authority
over evil spirits.

249
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,639
Protect us, lord.

250
00:12:37,641 --> 00:12:39,808
What's going on? Here. Just wait for it.

251
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:42,410
Protect us from the devil
as we feel him approaching.

252
00:12:43,881 --> 00:12:46,081
See, that been hitting
the same spot every night.

253
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:46,615
Since when?

254
00:12:46,617 --> 00:12:48,583
Since Lena Duchannes came to town.

255
00:12:48,585 --> 00:12:50,752
My mama heard she's
from a mental institution

256
00:12:50,754 --> 00:12:53,655
because she killed a boy on
the train tracks in Atlanta.

257
00:12:53,657 --> 00:12:54,890
- Oh, bullshit.
- Bullshit.

258
00:12:54,892 --> 00:12:56,091
Watch your tongue!

259
00:12:56,093 --> 00:12:58,560
Well, my mama said that
her mother killed her father

260
00:12:58,562 --> 00:13:00,095
and then just left town like that.

261
00:13:00,097 --> 00:13:02,964
Shut your mouth, Emily!

262
00:13:02,966 --> 00:13:06,435
Ethan Wate, may I speak
with you for a moment?

263
00:13:06,437 --> 00:13:08,503
Right now?

264
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:11,406
What is wrong with you?

265
00:13:11,408 --> 00:13:12,874
I'm just sick of people in this town

266
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:14,910
putting down someone
they just don't know.

267
00:13:16,112 --> 00:13:19,915
and you <i>know</i> Lena Duchannes?

268
00:13:19,917 --> 00:13:22,150
Is that what you're saying, Ethan?

269
00:13:22,152 --> 00:13:23,318
You know what?

270
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,086
I'm sorry, but I don't
think I'm gonna be able

271
00:13:25,088 --> 00:13:27,355
to go to the movies
with you this weekend.

272
00:13:27,357 --> 00:13:29,624
I think we need time apart.

273
00:13:29,626 --> 00:13:32,294
And I'm sorry to hurt you.

274
00:13:32,296 --> 00:13:35,096
Let's go.

275
00:13:35,098 --> 00:13:39,034
Did I not say that to her
at the end of sophomore year?

276
00:13:39,036 --> 00:13:41,770
Hey, some girls are just mad dogs, son.

277
00:13:41,772 --> 00:13:45,373
You can either run or shoot.

278
00:13:52,982 --> 00:13:55,350
Ethan? Ethan.

279
00:13:55,352 --> 00:13:57,819
Can I talk to you about
something real quick?

280
00:13:57,821 --> 00:13:59,654
I want you to know something.

281
00:13:59,656 --> 00:14:02,390
I still care deeply for you as a friend.

282
00:14:02,392 --> 00:14:06,094
And I pray every night that
you don't go straight to hell.

283
00:14:06,096 --> 00:14:08,830
Oh, I-I won't go
straight to hell, Emily.

284
00:14:08,832 --> 00:14:12,467
I wanna stop off in New York first.

285
00:14:14,972 --> 00:14:17,539
Okay. Everybody take your seats.

286
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:19,274
Hi, darling. Good to see you again.

287
00:14:19,276 --> 00:14:20,342
How's your mama?

288
00:14:20,344 --> 00:14:21,376
Boys.

289
00:14:21,378 --> 00:14:22,978
Billy, get down.

290
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:26,448
Okay, you should have
read this over the summer.

291
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:30,919
We're gonna start by discussing
the character of Boo Radley.

292
00:14:30,921 --> 00:14:33,989
The town shut-in with
a mysterious past.

293
00:14:33,991 --> 00:14:35,290
You mean Macon Ravenwood?

294
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:37,559
- Savannah!
- Excuse me?

295
00:14:37,561 --> 00:14:41,096
Um, my mama says I-I really
shouldn't be reading this book.

296
00:14:41,098 --> 00:14:43,098
This is one of those banned books.

297
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,867
Yes, well, I got permission
from the school board

298
00:14:45,869 --> 00:14:47,168
to try it for a semester.

299
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:48,570
Oh, well, I'm not reading anything

300
00:14:48,572 --> 00:14:49,704
that was banned from our church.

301
00:14:49,706 --> 00:14:50,739
Me neither.

302
00:14:50,741 --> 00:14:52,974
My mama also says that...

303
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:56,277
I shouldn't be in the
same class as a Ravenwood.

304
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:57,412
She says it ain't right

305
00:14:57,414 --> 00:14:59,214
that they get to be
with us Christian kids.

306
00:14:59,216 --> 00:15:00,915
Emily, shut up!

307
00:15:00,917 --> 00:15:02,183
My mama says the same thing.

308
00:15:02,185 --> 00:15:04,819
Says her whole family are Satanists.

309
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:06,755
They pray to Satan stark naked.

310
00:15:06,757 --> 00:15:07,989
Dear lord...

311
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:09,824
Emily, what do you think you're doing?

312
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:10,925
You can't pray in class.

313
00:15:10,927 --> 00:15:13,261
- Dear lord...
- Now, you stop it.

314
00:15:13,263 --> 00:15:15,030
I humbly pray you protect
us from all things evil...

315
00:15:15,032 --> 00:15:17,399
Girls, I'm telling you this
right now. You stop it now.

316
00:15:17,401 --> 00:15:18,833
There are unnatural things
among us who serve...

317
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:20,402
I don't know what you're thinking.

318
00:15:20,404 --> 00:15:22,337
...Christian believers.
Please, Jesus, help me!

319
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,839
Save me from
these evil --

320
00:15:30,546 --> 00:15:31,846
She did it!

321
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:34,683
It was her! She broke the windows!

322
00:15:34,685 --> 00:15:37,252
Why would she do something like this?!

323
00:15:39,523 --> 00:15:41,790
You all right?

324
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:51,199
What the hell was that?

325
00:17:17,486 --> 00:17:19,821
Lena?

326
00:17:19,823 --> 00:17:23,892
Hello?

327
00:18:07,703 --> 00:18:10,071
What are you doing here?

328
00:18:10,073 --> 00:18:14,242
I-I just came to see if you were okay.

329
00:18:14,244 --> 00:18:15,610
What for?

330
00:18:15,612 --> 00:18:17,512
I don't know.

331
00:18:17,514 --> 00:18:19,080
You okay?

332
00:18:19,082 --> 00:18:20,515
Yeah.

333
00:18:20,517 --> 00:18:21,950
Okay.

334
00:18:21,952 --> 00:18:24,385
You can go now.

335
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:29,557
Go away!

336
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:30,725
No.

337
00:18:30,727 --> 00:18:32,227
Yes!

338
00:18:32,229 --> 00:18:33,394
No.

339
00:18:33,396 --> 00:18:34,429
- Go!
- No.

340
00:18:34,431 --> 00:18:36,397
Jerk!

341
00:18:58,387 --> 00:18:59,454
Sorry about Emily.

342
00:18:59,456 --> 00:19:01,856
She can be meaner than chickenshit.

343
00:19:01,858 --> 00:19:03,625
Never understood that saying.

344
00:19:03,627 --> 00:19:06,361
Yeah. Me neither.

345
00:19:06,363 --> 00:19:08,529
And I should know better by now.

346
00:19:08,531 --> 00:19:11,299
They always hate me,
no matter where I go.

347
00:19:11,301 --> 00:19:14,502
Well, they're a mess of
fools. What do you care?

348
00:19:14,504 --> 00:19:17,605
Never been "on the outside
looking in" your whole life,

349
00:19:17,607 --> 00:19:18,907
have you?

350
00:19:21,476 --> 00:19:24,112
Well, let me see if I can remember this.

351
00:19:24,114 --> 00:19:25,314
It's Bukowski.

352
00:19:26,716 --> 00:19:29,550
"some lose all soul.

353
00:19:29,552 --> 00:19:35,490
"some lose all mind
and become soul, insane.

354
00:19:35,492 --> 00:19:39,727
"some lose all-- all...mind..."

355
00:19:39,729 --> 00:19:41,029
Hold on.

356
00:19:41,031 --> 00:19:42,797
"some lose all soul and become mind."

357
00:19:44,034 --> 00:19:46,935
"some lose all mind and become soul."

358
00:19:46,937 --> 00:19:48,269
Oh, man.

359
00:19:48,271 --> 00:19:50,338
I memorized this whole
thing to impress you.

360
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:51,139
Damn!

361
00:19:51,141 --> 00:19:53,975
- You can't help it.
- What?

362
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:58,079
Fitting in anywhere, drooling charm.

363
00:19:58,081 --> 00:20:01,649
I never know whether
you're insulting me or not.

364
00:20:01,651 --> 00:20:02,817
I'm sorry.

365
00:20:02,819 --> 00:20:04,986
No. Hey, I like it.

366
00:20:04,988 --> 00:20:06,487
You know?

367
00:20:06,489 --> 00:20:09,457
If it makes any difference, um...

368
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:10,858
I like you.

369
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,560
You may not think so later.

370
00:20:12,562 --> 00:20:14,162
Pbht! Okay.

371
00:20:14,164 --> 00:20:17,332
Uh, you can't complain
about not having any friends

372
00:20:17,334 --> 00:20:20,668
and then make a guy work
this hard trying to be one.

373
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:23,671
Unless you actually do think I'm a jerk.

374
00:20:23,673 --> 00:20:24,973
Then I'll just go.

375
00:20:24,975 --> 00:20:26,741
Run and tell your
friends about the freak.

376
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:31,279
You really think I'm that guy?

377
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:36,818
No.

378
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:39,020
Okay.

379
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:43,491
I should get back.

380
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:48,997
You, uh, you read those chapters
in "to kill a mockingbird"?

381
00:20:48,999 --> 00:20:50,865
Yeah. I've read it twice before.

382
00:20:50,867 --> 00:20:53,267
Oh! It's good, isn't it?

383
00:20:53,269 --> 00:20:54,102
Yeah.

384
00:20:54,104 --> 00:20:55,336
You ever see the movie?

385
00:20:55,338 --> 00:20:57,505
- No.
- Oh, it's good too.

386
00:20:57,507 --> 00:20:59,273
We should watch it, actually.

387
00:20:59,275 --> 00:21:01,409
You ever-- ever
read any Vonnegut?

388
00:21:01,411 --> 00:21:02,210
No.

389
00:21:02,212 --> 00:21:03,811
Kurt Vonnegut?

390
00:21:03,813 --> 00:21:05,580
No? "Slaughterhouse-Five"?

391
00:21:05,582 --> 00:21:06,547
He's great.

392
00:21:06,549 --> 00:21:08,249
He's-- he's banned
too, actually.

393
00:21:08,251 --> 00:21:10,051
You only read banned books?

394
00:21:10,053 --> 00:21:12,153
Um, I don't <i>only</i> read banned books.

395
00:21:12,155 --> 00:21:13,988
But, I don't
know, I just --

396
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:16,224
All the-- all the
books they let you read

397
00:21:16,226 --> 00:21:19,160
Are, like, pretty boring, I guess.

398
00:21:19,162 --> 00:21:20,995
Thanks. I'm
sorry I was --

399
00:21:20,997 --> 00:21:24,766
Oh, I-It's okay. It's okay.

400
00:21:24,768 --> 00:21:26,401
Look, you should go.

401
00:21:26,403 --> 00:21:28,403
My uncle doesn't really like
people being around the house.

402
00:21:28,405 --> 00:21:31,939
I know. I sort of, uh...went inside.

403
00:21:31,941 --> 00:21:34,242
You went inside the house?

404
00:21:34,244 --> 00:21:36,244
I didn't mean
to. I just --

405
00:21:36,246 --> 00:21:39,313
I get it. People think he's scary.

406
00:21:39,315 --> 00:21:43,584
But he's just Boo Radley shy, right?

407
00:21:43,586 --> 00:21:45,653
Okay.

408
00:21:45,655 --> 00:21:48,689
Hey, um...

409
00:21:48,691 --> 00:21:52,827
I got you sort of a "welcome
to suckass Gatlin" gift.

410
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:59,067
I thought you could put it
on your-- on your chain.

411
00:21:59,069 --> 00:22:01,135
Lena?

412
00:22:01,137 --> 00:22:03,905
We have a guest?

413
00:22:03,907 --> 00:22:05,073
He's leaving.

414
00:22:05,075 --> 00:22:06,107
Hello, sir.

415
00:22:06,109 --> 00:22:08,242
Manners? That's nice.

416
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:11,045
I-I-I go to school with
Lena. I'm Ethan Wate.

417
00:22:11,047 --> 00:22:12,680
Pleasure to make your acquaintance.

418
00:22:12,682 --> 00:22:14,882
You Lila Evers' boy?

419
00:22:14,884 --> 00:22:17,251
Yes, sir.

420
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:18,786
You knew my mother?

421
00:22:18,788 --> 00:22:23,891
Lena, why don't you ask
your friend in for tea?

422
00:22:23,893 --> 00:22:25,526
Tell him you can't stay.

423
00:22:25,528 --> 00:22:27,762
I'd love to. Thank you, sir.

424
00:22:27,764 --> 00:22:29,530
He's not scary.

425
00:22:31,467 --> 00:22:34,569
Mr. Wate, make yourself comfortable.

426
00:22:38,474 --> 00:22:42,176
Oh, I-I'm sorry about
walking in uninvited before.

427
00:22:42,178 --> 00:22:44,245
No problem at all.

428
00:22:44,247 --> 00:22:48,282
It's so rarely that we get visitors

429
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:51,152
from our...beloved Gatlin.

430
00:22:51,154 --> 00:22:52,787
Don't be a snob, uncle.

431
00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:56,124
<i>It's not their fault you
never speak to any of 'em.</i>

432
00:22:56,126 --> 00:22:57,492
And it's not my fault

433
00:22:57,494 --> 00:23:00,628
That I have a predilection
for good breeding,

434
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:05,666
reasonable intelligence, and
passable personal hygiene.

435
00:23:08,037 --> 00:23:11,205
But since my family founded this town,

436
00:23:11,207 --> 00:23:14,775
I have no alternative to call it home.

437
00:23:16,011 --> 00:23:18,746
So...

438
00:23:18,748 --> 00:23:21,482
There we are.

439
00:23:21,484 --> 00:23:24,785
Oh, that's a beautiful piano.

440
00:23:24,787 --> 00:23:26,053
Oh, yes.

441
00:23:26,055 --> 00:23:27,188
Do you play?

442
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:28,689
No.

443
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:33,227
Lena, why don't you play
something for our guest?

444
00:23:33,229 --> 00:23:35,496
'Cause we're not in a Jane Austen novel.

445
00:23:36,598 --> 00:23:39,500
Then why don't you go make us some tea?

446
00:23:39,502 --> 00:23:41,602
Again, wrong century.

447
00:23:41,604 --> 00:23:45,206
Well, then, would it
disturb either of you

448
00:23:45,208 --> 00:23:49,911
if I...ran my fingers
'cross the ivories?

449
00:23:49,913 --> 00:23:51,879
I find it very therapeutic.

450
00:23:51,881 --> 00:23:52,980
Uncle's upset.

451
00:23:52,982 --> 00:23:54,182
School called.

452
00:23:54,184 --> 00:23:55,516
Put me on probation

453
00:23:55,518 --> 00:23:58,186
until the window thing
gets investigated.

454
00:23:58,188 --> 00:23:59,453
That's crazy.

455
00:23:59,455 --> 00:24:00,788
That was not your fault.

456
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:04,859
Voice of reason in a
town of buttermilk minds.

457
00:24:04,861 --> 00:24:07,495
Lena, I could get to
like this friend of yours.

458
00:24:07,497 --> 00:24:09,263
I mean, it's like blaming you

459
00:24:09,265 --> 00:24:10,898
for the lightning on Honey Hill.

460
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:13,568
Oh, yes, I heard about the lightning.

461
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:16,837
In fact, a similar occurrence
took place in Venezuela

462
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:19,407
for many years at lake Maracaibo.

463
00:24:19,409 --> 00:24:21,475
You can look it up on Google.

464
00:24:21,477 --> 00:24:23,311
Uncle loves Google.

465
00:24:23,313 --> 00:24:25,780
In any event, I'll sort
it out with the school.

466
00:24:25,782 --> 00:24:28,282
But I understand your
indignation, Ethan.

467
00:24:28,284 --> 00:24:31,819
Probation! Implies a
source of authority.

468
00:24:31,821 --> 00:24:33,287
What is that source?

469
00:24:33,289 --> 00:24:36,457
A bunch of sexually
frustrated housewives

470
00:24:36,459 --> 00:24:40,061
with miniscule minds
and voluminous backsides.

471
00:24:42,899 --> 00:24:46,234
No, there's only two kinds
of people in Gatlin --

472
00:24:46,236 --> 00:24:48,636
The ones who are too stupid to leave

473
00:24:48,638 --> 00:24:51,372
and the ones who are too stuck to move.

474
00:24:51,374 --> 00:24:54,408
My mother used to say
that exact same thing.

475
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:55,743
Is that so?

476
00:24:55,745 --> 00:24:59,347
She was a lovely woman, your mother.

477
00:24:59,349 --> 00:25:02,383
I was so sorry to hear of her passing.

478
00:25:02,385 --> 00:25:05,052
Of course, I only knew
her through her books.

479
00:25:05,054 --> 00:25:08,256
I read everything she wrote
on the southern plantations.

480
00:25:08,258 --> 00:25:10,057
You plan on being a writer?

481
00:25:10,059 --> 00:25:11,559
I don't know yet. Maybe.

482
00:25:11,561 --> 00:25:14,328
- What if I had a magic wand...
- Macon!

483
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:18,466
...and I could let you
see your whole future?

484
00:25:18,468 --> 00:25:20,234
What would be there?

485
00:25:20,236 --> 00:25:23,337
And don't spare me the gory details.

486
00:25:23,339 --> 00:25:24,905
Well, sir, I'm not sure.

487
00:25:24,907 --> 00:25:28,376
Um, one thing I do
know, though, is college.

488
00:25:28,378 --> 00:25:30,778
I'm definitely planning on going.

489
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,313
Oh, really?

490
00:25:32,315 --> 00:25:33,914
Where have you applied?

491
00:25:33,916 --> 00:25:35,049
All of them.

492
00:25:35,051 --> 00:25:37,318
As long as they're
not too far from home.

493
00:25:38,588 --> 00:25:41,722
I mean, um, as long as
it's a local college.

494
00:25:41,724 --> 00:25:46,294
Uh...uh, so I can stay with dad.

495
00:25:46,296 --> 00:25:47,995
I-I'll get my teaching degree,

496
00:25:47,997 --> 00:25:52,466
and-- and probably teach
at the high school...

497
00:25:52,468 --> 00:25:56,537
Or maybe I'll take over
the library from Amma...

498
00:25:56,539 --> 00:25:59,807
I-I'll probably marry Emily
Asher and we'll have two kids.

499
00:25:59,809 --> 00:26:02,243
But I'll never make
enough money for her,

500
00:26:02,245 --> 00:26:05,479
so I'll start drinking...

501
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:07,948
Get three duis and lose my job.

502
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:11,185
And, uh, have an affair on
and off with savannah snow

503
00:26:11,187 --> 00:26:12,753
till I'm 49.

504
00:26:12,755 --> 00:26:15,056
The kids will live with
their mother after we divorce.

505
00:26:15,058 --> 00:26:18,159
Then, when I'm 52, I'll
have my first heart attack,

506
00:26:18,161 --> 00:26:19,727
another one at 63.

507
00:26:19,729 --> 00:26:22,963
I'll move into an apartment
above the wayward dog bar

508
00:26:22,965 --> 00:26:26,634
and help them sweep up
after hours for free drinks.

509
00:26:26,636 --> 00:26:29,704
And then when I'm 64, I'll hang myself.

510
00:26:29,706 --> 00:26:33,407
Um, but they won't find
the body right away.

511
00:26:33,409 --> 00:26:35,476
Not until I stink.

512
00:26:35,478 --> 00:26:38,946
Well, you've got it all planned out.

513
00:26:38,948 --> 00:26:41,048
Good for you.

514
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:42,249
Ethan, are you okay?

515
00:26:42,251 --> 00:26:44,318
Yeah. Um, you'll have to excuse me.

516
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:47,054
I've not been sleeping too well.

517
00:26:56,098 --> 00:26:58,065
What did you do to him?

518
00:26:58,067 --> 00:26:59,500
I agreed to let you attend

519
00:26:59,502 --> 00:27:01,569
what passes for a school in this town,

520
00:27:01,571 --> 00:27:03,037
but no friendships.

521
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:06,006
Could you not at least let
me pretend until my birthday?

522
00:27:06,008 --> 00:27:07,975
You remember what happened
at the last school?

523
00:27:07,977 --> 00:27:12,213
This window shattering
is just the beginning!

524
00:27:12,215 --> 00:27:14,315
That boy is a danger to you!

525
00:27:14,317 --> 00:27:15,649
Don't invite him here again!

526
00:27:15,651 --> 00:27:17,251
Oh, I wouldn't worry.

527
00:27:17,253 --> 00:27:19,754
I'm sure he won't be back.

528
00:28:15,076 --> 00:28:16,343
You came back.

529
00:28:16,345 --> 00:28:18,479
Yeah. I-I'm sorry.

530
00:28:18,481 --> 00:28:20,247
I don't know what the hell
happened to me in there.

531
00:28:20,249 --> 00:28:22,082
It's not your fault.

532
00:28:34,763 --> 00:28:36,464
I hope this doesn't sound weird,

533
00:28:36,466 --> 00:28:38,399
but I think I've been dreaming about you

534
00:28:38,401 --> 00:28:40,468
every night for months.

535
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:45,840
That did not sound
as creepy when I --

536
00:28:45,842 --> 00:28:47,475
In my head.

537
00:28:48,277 --> 00:28:49,410
Can you forget I said that?

538
00:28:49,412 --> 00:28:50,411
Sure.

539
00:28:50,413 --> 00:28:51,812
Okay.

540
00:28:51,814 --> 00:28:54,648
Um...oh.

541
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:56,050
- Your present.
- Right. Great.

542
00:28:56,052 --> 00:28:59,386
- The present.
- That's why I came back.

543
00:28:59,388 --> 00:29:01,489
Uh, so it opens. See?

544
00:29:01,491 --> 00:29:06,393
Um...e-c-w,
g-k-d.

545
00:29:06,395 --> 00:29:09,430
December 21st, 1863.

546
00:29:09,432 --> 00:29:11,866
December 21st?

547
00:29:11,868 --> 00:29:13,834
Yeah.

548
00:29:16,137 --> 00:29:18,639
What's the matter?

549
00:29:18,641 --> 00:29:21,342
It's my birthday. I'll be 16.

550
00:29:21,344 --> 00:29:22,443
Wow.

551
00:29:22,445 --> 00:29:25,079
That's... That is amazing.

552
00:29:25,081 --> 00:29:27,982
I don't-- you know, I don't
believe in signs usually,

553
00:29:27,984 --> 00:29:30,417
but that-- that seems
like a pretty badass sign.

554
00:29:33,421 --> 00:29:36,724
So y-you're 15 and you're a junior?

555
00:29:36,726 --> 00:29:38,792
That's-- you
must be a brain.

556
00:29:38,794 --> 00:29:40,327
You-- you
skip a grade?

557
00:29:40,329 --> 00:29:41,795
Yeah.

558
00:29:41,797 --> 00:29:47,935
Well, consider this an
early sweet 16 present.

559
00:29:58,547 --> 00:30:00,281
- Ethan!
- Genevieve!

560
00:30:01,484 --> 00:30:03,317
Genevieve! No!

561
00:30:04,486 --> 00:30:05,853
Ethan!

562
00:30:15,397 --> 00:30:18,232
Dad!

563
00:30:18,234 --> 00:30:19,333
Dad?

564
00:30:20,535 --> 00:30:21,902
Oh, Amma, what are you doing?

565
00:30:21,904 --> 00:30:23,737
I'm looking for some
books your mother had.

566
00:30:23,739 --> 00:30:25,472
I have to return them to the library.

567
00:30:25,474 --> 00:30:26,941
- You all right?
- How did I get home?

568
00:30:26,943 --> 00:30:28,509
What-- what are
you talking about?

569
00:30:28,511 --> 00:30:30,044
When I got here, you
were already in bed.

570
00:30:30,046 --> 00:30:31,445
Glad you're getting some sleep.

571
00:30:31,447 --> 00:30:33,047
Amma! How did I get here?!

572
00:30:33,049 --> 00:30:35,015
- Why are you shouting?
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

573
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:38,485
Heard you had trouble at school today.

574
00:30:38,487 --> 00:30:40,988
My father always said
trouble follows that family

575
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:42,523
like stink on a fly's ass.

576
00:30:42,525 --> 00:30:44,191
You better stay away from that girl.

577
00:30:44,193 --> 00:30:45,993
You don't need to take care of us, Amma.

578
00:30:45,995 --> 00:30:48,562
I promised your mother and I want to.

579
00:30:48,564 --> 00:30:49,630
No, I d-- Amma.

580
00:30:49,632 --> 00:30:52,766
I'm sorry. I just...

581
00:30:52,768 --> 00:30:55,302
I don't think it's any of your business.

582
00:30:56,671 --> 00:30:58,172
Where'd you get that?

583
00:30:59,608 --> 00:31:01,742
- I don't know.
- Don't lie to me.

584
00:31:01,744 --> 00:31:03,377
What's wrong?

585
00:31:03,379 --> 00:31:06,380
You listen to me.

586
00:31:06,382 --> 00:31:07,948
You go and bury that in greenbrier

587
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:09,883
and forget you ever found it.

588
00:31:10,986 --> 00:31:14,688
I never said I was in greenbrier, Amma.

589
00:33:22,517 --> 00:33:26,420
My family's...different.

590
00:33:26,422 --> 00:33:28,622
Different how?

591
00:33:28,624 --> 00:33:31,592
We do things...

592
00:33:31,594 --> 00:33:33,927
We do different things.

593
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:36,864
So, like, what, you're from Europe?

594
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:49,543
You know how some families are
musical and some have money.

595
00:33:49,545 --> 00:33:52,279
Well, we have powers.

596
00:33:52,281 --> 00:33:55,349
Powers?

597
00:33:55,351 --> 00:33:57,451
Yeah.

598
00:34:02,524 --> 00:34:05,259
What was that out there?

599
00:34:05,261 --> 00:34:07,127
That was Macon.

600
00:34:07,129 --> 00:34:08,495
He had the house "bound."

601
00:34:08,497 --> 00:34:11,298
It's a spell to protect
me when he's not here.

602
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,199
A spell?

603
00:34:12,201 --> 00:34:14,234
Yeah. It won't happen again.

604
00:34:14,236 --> 00:34:15,502
Okay.

605
00:34:15,504 --> 00:34:18,272
Lena...

606
00:34:18,274 --> 00:34:19,673
Are you a witch?

607
00:34:19,675 --> 00:34:20,841
No.

608
00:34:25,013 --> 00:34:26,713
I mean, calling us "witches"

609
00:34:26,715 --> 00:34:28,749
is like calling the smart kids "geeks"

610
00:34:28,751 --> 00:34:30,284
or the athletes "jocks."

611
00:34:30,286 --> 00:34:32,452
We prefer the term "caster."

612
00:34:32,454 --> 00:34:35,122
I didn't mean to break those windows.

613
00:34:35,124 --> 00:34:37,024
My powers are getting stronger.

614
00:34:37,026 --> 00:34:40,627
I can't always control it.

615
00:34:40,629 --> 00:34:43,997
You look nauseous.

616
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:45,532
You want a cookie?

617
00:34:45,534 --> 00:34:47,000
The sugar will help.

618
00:34:47,002 --> 00:34:50,404
I made these last night.

619
00:34:50,406 --> 00:34:52,906
From a cookie mix.

620
00:34:55,944 --> 00:34:57,811
Okay. What about this?

621
00:34:57,813 --> 00:34:59,479
I don't know.

622
00:34:59,481 --> 00:35:00,914
You don't know?

623
00:35:00,916 --> 00:35:03,650
No. It wasn't me.

624
00:35:03,652 --> 00:35:05,819
I mean, it was something else.

625
00:35:05,821 --> 00:35:07,654
Something happens when we both hold it.

626
00:35:07,656 --> 00:35:09,022
Okay. Hold on a minute.

627
00:35:09,024 --> 00:35:12,392
Satan has nothing to
do with y'all, right?

628
00:35:12,394 --> 00:35:17,097
That is such a mortal thing to say.

629
00:35:17,099 --> 00:35:17,998
God.

630
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,867
Well, there is <i>evil,</i> Lena.

631
00:35:19,869 --> 00:35:22,569
Yes, there are evil casters, Ethan.

632
00:35:22,571 --> 00:35:26,173
I mean, are you trying to say
that there are no evil mortals?

633
00:35:26,175 --> 00:35:27,541
Only difference is,

634
00:35:27,543 --> 00:35:32,179
you all made up somebody
else to blame for it.

635
00:35:37,151 --> 00:35:39,052
I'm just trying to figure this out.

636
00:35:39,054 --> 00:35:41,088
So, you have powers, okay?

637
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:42,956
What else can you do?

638
00:35:50,698 --> 00:35:54,034
I collect poetry.

639
00:36:15,189 --> 00:36:18,159
I'm not meant to show
a mortal any of this.

640
00:36:18,561 --> 00:36:19,393
It's okay.

641
00:36:19,395 --> 00:36:22,096
No. I shouldn't have.

642
00:36:25,033 --> 00:36:29,169
You know, I just hate
hiding all the time.

643
00:36:29,171 --> 00:36:33,473
Feeling like everybody's
whispering about me.

644
00:36:33,475 --> 00:36:39,179
Being afraid of people
finding out I'm this freak.

645
00:36:39,181 --> 00:36:42,115
Sometimes you just want to be normal.

646
00:36:46,788 --> 00:36:48,622
What are you smiling at?

647
00:36:48,624 --> 00:36:50,357
Lena, you're a miracle.

648
00:36:50,359 --> 00:36:53,727
Why would you <i>ever</i> want to be normal?

649
00:37:07,442 --> 00:37:09,676
You're not what I expected.

650
00:37:09,678 --> 00:37:11,178
What do you mean?

651
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:15,482
Don't get mad, but I've
dreamt about you too.

652
00:37:15,484 --> 00:37:18,418
I just didn't think you were real.

653
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:19,486
Lena?

654
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:21,722
Oh, it's Macon. You've got to go.

655
00:37:21,724 --> 00:37:23,090
Why didn't you tell me?

656
00:37:23,092 --> 00:37:25,258
It scares me.

657
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:26,960
Doesn't it scare you?

658
00:37:26,962 --> 00:37:29,496
You wanna go out with me?

659
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:36,603
Wait. Am I going out the window?

660
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:47,247
Whoa. Can you make anything grow?

661
00:37:47,249 --> 00:37:50,083
- Lena?
- Get out.

662
00:37:52,987 --> 00:37:54,921
Okay. How about Friday, movies?

663
00:37:54,923 --> 00:37:56,023
Friday, I can't. It's a holiday.

664
00:37:56,025 --> 00:37:57,591
What holiday?

665
00:37:57,593 --> 00:37:59,860
It's a harvest thing. Family
coming from out of town.

666
00:37:59,862 --> 00:38:00,894
Okay. Saturday.

667
00:38:00,896 --> 00:38:01,895
Lena!

668
00:38:01,897 --> 00:38:03,397
I don't know. Hurry up!

669
00:38:03,399 --> 00:38:04,798
Say yes.

670
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,400
Yes.

671
00:38:06,402 --> 00:38:08,035
Can I see you tomorrow?

672
00:38:08,037 --> 00:38:10,370
I don't know. Get out of here!

673
00:38:10,372 --> 00:38:11,671
Okay.

674
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:19,513
Ethan?

675
00:38:19,515 --> 00:38:20,947
Yeah?

676
00:38:20,949 --> 00:38:25,252
Promise me it'll be a really
normal, awkward teenager date.

677
00:38:25,254 --> 00:38:27,621
I swear. I won't even call you after.

678
00:38:27,623 --> 00:38:28,889
Jerk.

679
00:38:28,891 --> 00:38:30,057
Witch.

680
00:38:30,059 --> 00:38:31,158
Jock.

681
00:38:32,995 --> 00:38:36,163
See you tomorrow.

682
00:38:38,366 --> 00:38:42,569
You could have made a ladder, you know.

683
00:39:52,373 --> 00:39:55,142
Keep your distance.

684
00:39:56,677 --> 00:40:01,781
Thank you kindly for
your courteous welcome.

685
00:40:01,783 --> 00:40:04,284
I felt something tonight.

686
00:40:04,286 --> 00:40:05,819
I've been feeling something every night

687
00:40:05,821 --> 00:40:07,420
since you brought that girl here.

688
00:40:07,422 --> 00:40:10,524
Well, it's the only place
left I have to protect her.

689
00:40:10,526 --> 00:40:12,993
So you bring darkness to this town.

690
00:40:12,995 --> 00:40:17,264
I can feel it like a
hand twisting my insides.

691
00:40:17,266 --> 00:40:18,798
Well, that's not Lena!

692
00:40:19,967 --> 00:40:21,301
Sarafine?

693
00:40:22,403 --> 00:40:24,771
You said she was gone for good.

694
00:40:24,773 --> 00:40:25,805
Yeah.

695
00:40:25,807 --> 00:40:29,743
Well, we...we did have
an agreement, but...

696
00:40:29,745 --> 00:40:33,547
she's been shadowing
Lena for the past year.

697
00:40:33,549 --> 00:40:36,650
And there have been some accidents.

698
00:40:36,652 --> 00:40:38,919
Macon, no danger better come to that boy

699
00:40:38,921 --> 00:40:40,220
because of your kind.

700
00:40:40,222 --> 00:40:42,455
Yeah, well, then you
keep him on a leash!

701
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:45,091
What happened at greenbrier?

702
00:40:45,093 --> 00:40:46,359
I don't know!

703
00:40:46,361 --> 00:40:48,261
Lena was hysterical.

704
00:40:48,263 --> 00:40:49,462
Boy was unconscious.

705
00:40:49,464 --> 00:40:51,398
I brought him home, called you.

706
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,800
You're <i>the seer.</i> You
tell me what happened!

707
00:40:53,802 --> 00:40:56,136
This is the sacred
place of my ancestors.

708
00:40:56,138 --> 00:40:57,604
You hear?

709
00:40:57,606 --> 00:41:00,106
You want some answers,
you show me some respect.

710
00:41:00,108 --> 00:41:03,243
Yeah. I...i apologize.

711
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:06,613
Ethan had some kind of charm.

712
00:41:06,615 --> 00:41:08,615
It had a Duchannes power in it.

713
00:41:08,617 --> 00:41:11,017
Well, that would be Sarafine.

714
00:41:11,019 --> 00:41:15,355
Maybe she's using the charm
to get to Lena through the boy.

715
00:41:15,357 --> 00:41:17,457
You tell them I have to
know what Sarafine's up to.

716
00:41:17,459 --> 00:41:18,959
You know, it wouldn't break your face

717
00:41:18,961 --> 00:41:20,860
To ask for some help
instead of expecting it,

718
00:41:20,862 --> 00:41:23,230
like your family's been doing
with mine for too many years.

719
00:41:23,232 --> 00:41:25,065
Now, don't you roll your eyes at me.

720
00:41:25,067 --> 00:41:30,770
Then please ask them kindly
what Sarafine is up to.

721
00:41:30,772 --> 00:41:34,174
Brought your favorites, Uncle Abner.

722
00:41:34,176 --> 00:41:37,043
Shrimp and grits.

723
00:41:37,045 --> 00:41:39,679
Fried oysters.

724
00:41:40,348 --> 00:41:42,482
And a coconut pie.

725
00:41:42,484 --> 00:41:43,450
Hmm.

726
00:41:43,452 --> 00:41:45,518
No wonder he's no longer with us.

727
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,787
Pay no attention to him, uncle.

728
00:41:58,833 --> 00:42:03,270
Uncle Abner, we are in
need of your intercession.

729
00:42:03,272 --> 00:42:06,606
Along with Aunt Ida and auntie may...

730
00:42:06,608 --> 00:42:10,644
I humbly call upon your spirits.

731
00:42:18,519 --> 00:42:21,588
What are they saying?

732
00:42:22,323 --> 00:42:23,657
Nothing.

733
00:42:23,659 --> 00:42:25,025
Nothing yet.

734
00:42:25,027 --> 00:42:29,029
Tell them they have to
help us stop Sarafine.

735
00:42:31,232 --> 00:42:34,067
"some things cannot be stopped."

736
00:43:34,628 --> 00:43:37,163
This is your favorite spot?

737
00:43:37,165 --> 00:43:39,432
It's all about the sign.

738
00:43:39,434 --> 00:43:41,034
You see up there?

739
00:43:41,036 --> 00:43:42,235
Mm-hmm.

740
00:43:42,237 --> 00:43:43,537
That's the road to freedom.

741
00:43:44,439 --> 00:43:45,739
My mama used to say,

742
00:43:45,741 --> 00:43:47,874
"get out of this town
as soon as you can.

743
00:43:47,876 --> 00:43:50,343
"go find out how other
people live and think

744
00:43:50,345 --> 00:43:53,346
before you find a place that's yours."

745
00:43:53,348 --> 00:43:57,350
And I'd say, "mom, um, I'm 9.

746
00:43:57,352 --> 00:43:59,252
How do I do that?" little Ethan.

747
00:44:01,123 --> 00:44:03,890
So that's when she
took me to the library.

748
00:44:03,892 --> 00:44:09,229
And, um, she said,
"Ethan, this is my church.

749
00:44:09,231 --> 00:44:14,334
"this is where my family goes
to celebrate what's holy --

750
00:44:14,336 --> 00:44:17,437
Ideas."

751
00:44:17,439 --> 00:44:19,072
Oh, wow. Sorry.

752
00:44:20,208 --> 00:44:23,376
Don't know where that came from.

753
00:44:26,415 --> 00:44:29,549
I wish I'd known her.

754
00:44:29,551 --> 00:44:31,418
Let's get out of here.

755
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:33,119
Let's go.

756
00:44:33,121 --> 00:44:34,354
Where?

757
00:44:34,356 --> 00:44:35,922
Anywhere.

758
00:44:35,924 --> 00:44:40,059
Lena, most people
spend their entire lives

759
00:44:40,061 --> 00:44:43,029
waiting for a moment that's
gonna change everything.

760
00:44:43,031 --> 00:44:44,063
It never happens.

761
00:44:44,065 --> 00:44:47,100
We can start our lives right now, okay?

762
00:44:47,102 --> 00:44:48,334
We just got to say yes.

763
00:44:48,336 --> 00:44:51,538
We just got to get in
the car and just go.

764
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:53,206
I can't do that.

765
00:44:53,208 --> 00:44:54,941
Why?

766
00:44:54,943 --> 00:44:57,977
When I turn 16...

767
00:44:57,979 --> 00:45:01,080
I might not even be who I am now.

768
00:45:01,082 --> 00:45:02,248
Why?

769
00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:04,484
What-- what
could happen

770
00:45:04,486 --> 00:45:06,453
besides getting your first hangover?

771
00:45:09,857 --> 00:45:13,026
When a female caster turns 16,

772
00:45:13,028 --> 00:45:15,462
we face what they call the claiming.

773
00:45:15,464 --> 00:45:17,230
My powers will be claimed

774
00:45:17,232 --> 00:45:19,632
for either the light or the dark,

775
00:45:19,634 --> 00:45:22,735
depending on my true nature...

776
00:45:22,737 --> 00:45:25,772
whatever I'm destined to be.

777
00:45:25,774 --> 00:45:29,142
That's-- that's why
Macon brought me here.

778
00:45:29,144 --> 00:45:31,311
Wait. What's Macon?

779
00:45:31,313 --> 00:45:32,612
He's a dark caster,

780
00:45:32,614 --> 00:45:35,381
but he's choosing to
be light for me now.

781
00:45:35,383 --> 00:45:37,584
He can choose? Then why can't you?

782
00:45:37,586 --> 00:45:43,356
They say that a female caster's
true nature chooses for her.

783
00:45:43,358 --> 00:45:45,859
I don't know why.

784
00:45:45,861 --> 00:45:47,560
Back up. Wait a minute.

785
00:45:47,562 --> 00:45:50,063
You're worried that when you turn 16,

786
00:45:50,065 --> 00:45:55,435
you're gonna be an evil...
Bitch...witch caster?

787
00:45:55,437 --> 00:45:58,137
I have 75 days left, Ethan.

788
00:46:01,442 --> 00:46:04,110
I don't know what I'll be.

789
00:46:05,746 --> 00:46:09,916
I don't know who I really am inside.

790
00:46:09,918 --> 00:46:11,951
Now, in the last year,

791
00:46:11,953 --> 00:46:15,221
Lena Duchannes has been
in three different schools

792
00:46:15,223 --> 00:46:16,623
in three different towns.

793
00:46:16,625 --> 00:46:17,891
I-I checked.

794
00:46:17,893 --> 00:46:19,826
And in every single one of them schools,

795
00:46:19,828 --> 00:46:22,295
they had accidents, they
had unnatural weather,

796
00:46:22,297 --> 00:46:25,532
they had... Well, they even had deaths.

797
00:46:27,335 --> 00:46:29,569
Now, I have a petition here

798
00:46:29,571 --> 00:46:33,473
signed by over 300 Gatlin
parents who demand...

799
00:46:33,475 --> 00:46:35,341
Demand that Lena
Duchannes be expelled...

800
00:46:35,343 --> 00:46:36,776
Excuse me. Excuse me.

801
00:46:36,778 --> 00:46:39,779
...and furthermore that
the Ravenwood property be --

802
00:46:47,588 --> 00:46:48,888
Oh, my god, mama.

803
00:46:48,890 --> 00:46:53,026
Excuse me for my untimely intervention.

804
00:46:54,528 --> 00:46:57,363
Principal Herbert.

805
00:46:57,365 --> 00:46:59,632
Mayor snow.

806
00:46:59,634 --> 00:47:01,968
And the Reverend Stephens, I believe.

807
00:47:01,970 --> 00:47:03,002
Yes, sir.

808
00:47:03,004 --> 00:47:05,071
Mm.

809
00:47:06,407 --> 00:47:08,474
Mrs. Lincoln.

810
00:47:08,476 --> 00:47:10,743
How dare you...

811
00:47:10,745 --> 00:47:13,146
Enter the house of the lord?

812
00:47:13,148 --> 00:47:16,883
Since my family own the
land it's built on...

813
00:47:16,885 --> 00:47:19,018
And I understood this to be an occasion

814
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:21,654
for all members of the community.

815
00:47:21,656 --> 00:47:25,792
Now, I'm sure y'all
have better things to do

816
00:47:25,794 --> 00:47:29,062
on such a beautiful
day, so I'll be brief.

817
00:47:29,064 --> 00:47:31,297
The accusations
against my niece --

818
00:47:31,299 --> 00:47:34,067
All spurious lies.

819
00:47:34,069 --> 00:47:35,868
For, according to
the weather channel --

820
00:47:35,870 --> 00:47:39,238
And you can verify
this on Google --

821
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:42,775
There were unseasonably
strong gusts from the east,

822
00:47:42,777 --> 00:47:45,178
which caused untold destruction

823
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:47,880
Up and down the South Carolina coast.

824
00:47:47,882 --> 00:47:52,385
So my niece will go
back to the institution

825
00:47:52,387 --> 00:47:54,821
that Gatlin presumes
to call educational,

826
00:47:54,823 --> 00:47:57,624
and she will be persecuted no longer.

827
00:47:57,626 --> 00:48:01,894
I thank you all for your cooperation.

828
00:48:01,896 --> 00:48:06,232
You have no right to tell us what to do.

829
00:48:06,234 --> 00:48:09,035
No matter how much money you have.

830
00:48:09,037 --> 00:48:12,238
Oh, Mrs. Lincoln, you're right.

831
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:16,142
My wealth should offer me no advantage.

832
00:48:16,144 --> 00:48:20,747
However, since my
ancestors founded Gatlin,

833
00:48:20,749 --> 00:48:23,783
my holdings do give
me a little leverage.

834
00:48:23,785 --> 00:48:27,320
For example, if I were
to donate the old mill

835
00:48:27,322 --> 00:48:31,791
to, say, a drug rehabilitation center...

836
00:48:31,793 --> 00:48:33,660
Oh, my god.

837
00:48:34,462 --> 00:48:38,331
There again, I own the land
the wayward dog motel stands on.

838
00:48:38,333 --> 00:48:40,800
Its closure would cause
a little inconvenience

839
00:48:40,802 --> 00:48:42,402
to one or two of you gentlemen.

840
00:48:42,404 --> 00:48:45,505
You'd have to travel out of
town to see your lady friends...

841
00:48:45,507 --> 00:48:47,740
When your wives believe

842
00:48:47,742 --> 00:48:50,410
That you are attending
yet another meeting

843
00:48:50,412 --> 00:48:53,513
of the American Civil
War reenactment society.

844
00:48:53,515 --> 00:48:56,282
So might I presume

845
00:48:56,284 --> 00:49:01,287
that this matter is now
comfortably laid to rest?

846
00:49:02,656 --> 00:49:05,158
I'm not afraid of you or your evil kind.

847
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:07,994
God our creator will
condemn you to hellfire

848
00:49:07,996 --> 00:49:10,997
along with terrorists,
atheists, homosexuals,

849
00:49:10,999 --> 00:49:14,167
Democrats, Liberals, Socialists...

850
00:49:14,169 --> 00:49:18,304
Greenpeace and all the
other unnatural abominations.

851
00:49:18,306 --> 00:49:20,773
My dear Mrs. Lincoln.

852
00:49:20,775 --> 00:49:24,711
If I were you, I would
welcome any kind of fire.

853
00:49:24,713 --> 00:49:26,446
Might give you the opportunity

854
00:49:26,448 --> 00:49:30,016
to burn that unfortunate
hat you're wearing.

855
00:49:44,031 --> 00:49:46,165
Sarafine.

856
00:49:49,170 --> 00:49:51,738
Well, I would have expected to find you

857
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:54,474
in something a little more chic.

858
00:49:54,476 --> 00:49:56,843
Oh, come on, Macon.

859
00:49:56,845 --> 00:49:58,611
She's perfect!

860
00:49:58,613 --> 00:50:00,913
She's a pillar of the community.

861
00:50:00,915 --> 00:50:03,216
You're right about the hat, though.

862
00:50:03,218 --> 00:50:04,550
Isn't it tragic?

863
00:50:04,552 --> 00:50:07,720
But if you borrow the body,
you have to borrow the closet.

864
00:50:07,722 --> 00:50:09,188
And, my dear,

865
00:50:09,190 --> 00:50:12,792
you would think the woman
invented the housecoat.

866
00:50:16,330 --> 00:50:18,998
So, let's see now.

867
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,234
Have you missed your little sister?

868
00:50:21,236 --> 00:50:22,301
No.

869
00:50:23,370 --> 00:50:25,271
Oh.

870
00:50:25,273 --> 00:50:26,873
Don't be unkind.

871
00:50:26,875 --> 00:50:30,443
You used to love playing in the dark.

872
00:50:30,445 --> 00:50:32,779
Remember?

873
00:50:33,881 --> 00:50:37,049
I can feel your powers waning.

874
00:50:37,051 --> 00:50:39,018
Hmm. That's so sad.

875
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:41,087
They're fading.

876
00:50:41,089 --> 00:50:43,656
And you know why that is.

877
00:50:43,658 --> 00:50:49,462
That's what comes of pretending
to be something you're not.

878
00:50:50,464 --> 00:50:52,532
Oh! Daddy's tie-pin.

879
00:50:52,534 --> 00:50:54,200
That is so sweet.

880
00:50:54,202 --> 00:50:58,437
The curse is gonna claim her, Macon.

881
00:51:01,008 --> 00:51:04,043
You're not quite sure, though, are you?

882
00:51:05,179 --> 00:51:06,512
Mm.

883
00:51:06,514 --> 00:51:09,982
If you were certain, then
why bring the boy into it?

884
00:51:09,984 --> 00:51:12,685
I didn't bring the boy into it.

885
00:51:12,687 --> 00:51:15,488
Love brought him in.

886
00:51:15,490 --> 00:51:17,990
Lena and the mortal have been
on their way to each other

887
00:51:17,992 --> 00:51:19,292
Since the day they were born.

888
00:51:19,294 --> 00:51:21,227
They have that terrible
thing, "destiny."

889
00:51:21,229 --> 00:51:22,628
Even your Lila sensed that.

890
00:51:22,630 --> 00:51:25,131
And you know the
law of the curse --

891
00:51:25,133 --> 00:51:27,366
No caster may love a mortal.

892
00:51:27,368 --> 00:51:31,037
Mind you, it couldn't have worked
out better if I <i>had</i> planned it.

893
00:51:31,039 --> 00:51:35,908
That first love-- oh, such joy.

894
00:51:35,910 --> 00:51:38,211
Such beauty.

895
00:51:38,213 --> 00:51:42,281
And that first heartbreak.

896
00:51:42,283 --> 00:51:44,784
So bitter.

897
00:51:44,786 --> 00:51:46,552
So painful.

898
00:51:46,554 --> 00:51:49,822
It's enough to turn any girl dark...

899
00:51:49,824 --> 00:51:52,258
mortal or caster.

900
00:51:53,461 --> 00:51:54,360
I'm so excited.

901
00:51:54,362 --> 00:51:56,495
Lena's birthday is gonna fall

902
00:51:56,497 --> 00:51:59,532
On the most powerful
solstice in 5,000 years!

903
00:51:59,534 --> 00:52:02,034
More energy is gonna be
released than ever before,

904
00:52:02,036 --> 00:52:04,036
and this earth's cycle will be over.

905
00:52:04,038 --> 00:52:06,606
She's gonna be more powerful
than either of us, Macon,

906
00:52:06,608 --> 00:52:08,741
and she will lead us all.

907
00:52:08,743 --> 00:52:10,676
Toward what?

908
00:52:10,678 --> 00:52:13,346
An age without hiding.

909
00:52:14,882 --> 00:52:18,551
I'm --
I'm so...

910
00:52:18,553 --> 00:52:21,654
Tired of hiding!

911
00:52:21,656 --> 00:52:25,124
These parasites have had
their own way long enough,

912
00:52:25,126 --> 00:52:26,359
don't you think?

913
00:52:26,361 --> 00:52:28,828
Oh! Here's a good game.

914
00:52:28,830 --> 00:52:32,098
Name one species that'll miss them.

915
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:34,166
See? You can't!

916
00:52:34,168 --> 00:52:39,071
Because mortals do nothing
but consume and destroy.

917
00:52:39,073 --> 00:52:41,807
They invent ideas...

918
00:52:41,809 --> 00:52:46,379
Like god and love and righteousness...

919
00:52:46,381 --> 00:52:48,347
And then they use those same ideas

920
00:52:48,349 --> 00:52:50,516
to kill anyone who disagrees with them.

921
00:52:50,518 --> 00:52:53,286
You really want to hang
out with those people?

922
00:52:53,288 --> 00:52:54,921
They pray without true beliefs

923
00:52:54,923 --> 00:52:57,023
and then wonder why
their spells don't work.

924
00:52:57,025 --> 00:52:59,358
They don't even value
their pathetic little lives

925
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:01,994
till seconds before
it's taken from them.

926
00:53:01,996 --> 00:53:03,863
Poor things.

927
00:53:03,865 --> 00:53:06,132
It's our turn, Macon.

928
00:53:06,134 --> 00:53:08,467
Darlin', come back.

929
00:53:08,469 --> 00:53:10,336
Come back.

930
00:53:10,338 --> 00:53:12,405
Lena will put an end to them.

931
00:53:12,407 --> 00:53:13,239
No.

932
00:53:13,241 --> 00:53:15,541
Lena will not turn dark.

933
00:53:15,543 --> 00:53:17,143
She's too strong.

934
00:53:17,145 --> 00:53:21,480
She has got no choice in
the matter, my darlin'.

935
00:53:21,482 --> 00:53:24,350
The curse has already begun.

936
00:53:24,352 --> 00:53:27,520
No. That is a lie!

937
00:53:30,825 --> 00:53:32,658
What's a lie, Mr. Ravenwood?

938
00:53:34,061 --> 00:53:35,928
My apologies.

939
00:53:35,930 --> 00:53:38,898
Lena will return to school.

940
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:41,968
And that is an end of it.

941
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:47,576
Keep it moving.

942
00:53:50,844 --> 00:53:52,979
Wow! You and Lena Duchannes.

943
00:53:52,981 --> 00:53:54,847
Yeah. Don't tell anybody.

944
00:53:54,849 --> 00:53:59,118
Aw, come on, and miss the
chance to see Emily shit nails?

945
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:01,854
I bet Lena could actually do that.

946
00:54:01,856 --> 00:54:03,889
What?

947
00:54:36,323 --> 00:54:41,193
Which one of you lucky
boys is Ethan Wate?

948
00:54:43,463 --> 00:54:44,630
Well?

949
00:54:44,632 --> 00:54:47,833
Which one of you has
the power of tongue?

950
00:54:47,835 --> 00:54:49,068
M-me am.

951
00:54:49,070 --> 00:54:51,070
I'm...me Ethan.

952
00:54:51,072 --> 00:54:52,705
Ethan!

953
00:54:56,476 --> 00:54:57,610
Do I know you?

954
00:54:57,612 --> 00:54:58,611
Not a bit.

955
00:54:58,613 --> 00:55:00,680
I'm Ridley Duchannes. Follow me.

956
00:55:00,682 --> 00:55:02,281
You're a relative of Lena's?

957
00:55:02,283 --> 00:55:04,684
Honey, you are looking at <i>the</i> relative.

958
00:55:04,986 --> 00:55:07,019
Uh, oh-- this
is my friend Link.

959
00:55:07,021 --> 00:55:08,821
Sincere pleasure, Link.

960
00:55:08,823 --> 00:55:11,791
H-- oh, ep--
I-- wa-- hush...

961
00:55:11,793 --> 00:55:12,825
Get in.

962
00:55:12,827 --> 00:55:14,126
Oh, I-I wasn't invited.

963
00:55:14,128 --> 00:55:16,662
I don't think her
uncle would, uh, like --

964
00:55:16,664 --> 00:55:20,800
Trust me, family's dying to meet you.

965
00:55:42,690 --> 00:55:44,590
Ravenwood.

966
00:55:44,592 --> 00:55:46,692
Been a long time.

967
00:55:49,597 --> 00:55:52,164
Lena and I are more like
sisters than cousins.

968
00:55:52,166 --> 00:55:54,233
I'm surprised she hasn't mentioned me.

969
00:55:54,235 --> 00:55:56,635
But then, I'm sure I
couldn't count high enough

970
00:55:56,637 --> 00:55:58,871
all the things Lena hasn't mentioned.

971
00:56:01,909 --> 00:56:05,111
Oh. Why, thank you, kind sir.

972
00:56:05,113 --> 00:56:07,146
I look okay?

973
00:56:07,148 --> 00:56:10,883
Always get a little
nervous seeing the family.

974
00:56:10,885 --> 00:56:12,985
You have lovely eyes.

975
00:56:12,987 --> 00:56:15,121
Mm.

976
00:56:15,123 --> 00:56:17,556
You're lucky those lips are spoken for.

977
00:56:17,558 --> 00:56:19,058
May I?

978
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:21,760
Mm. Such a gentleman, too.

979
00:56:25,699 --> 00:56:26,866
Night, mother.

980
00:56:26,868 --> 00:56:28,567
Ridley!

981
00:56:30,438 --> 00:56:31,937
...i told you to stay away.

982
00:56:31,939 --> 00:56:35,141
Why, I couldn't miss a
holiday with my family,

983
00:56:35,143 --> 00:56:36,775
now, could I, mama?

984
00:56:36,777 --> 00:56:38,177
Well, well.

985
00:56:38,179 --> 00:56:39,545
Ridley, my dear.

986
00:56:39,547 --> 00:56:42,748
What an unpleasant surprise.

987
00:56:42,750 --> 00:56:43,649
Uncle Macon.

988
00:56:43,651 --> 00:56:45,885
How old and weak you look.

989
00:56:45,887 --> 00:56:49,288
I distinctly remember
forgetting to invite you.

990
00:56:49,290 --> 00:56:52,591
And I told you never to
cross this threshold again!

991
00:56:54,862 --> 00:56:56,228
What?

992
00:56:56,230 --> 00:56:57,796
What have you done to him?

993
00:56:57,798 --> 00:57:00,733
Invited him to dinner
with the folks is all.

994
00:57:00,735 --> 00:57:02,668
Well...

995
00:57:02,670 --> 00:57:05,804
Why don't you escort
your underdressed friend

996
00:57:05,806 --> 00:57:08,240
into the dining room?

997
00:57:10,944 --> 00:57:12,711
I
wasn't --

998
00:57:12,713 --> 00:57:14,313
- Del.
- Wha --

999
00:57:18,185 --> 00:57:21,220
Hello, cuz.

1000
00:57:21,222 --> 00:57:22,855
Don't you look pretty.

1001
00:57:22,857 --> 00:57:24,256
Ethan?

1002
00:57:25,593 --> 00:57:27,893
Aw. Ain't that sweet?

1003
00:57:27,895 --> 00:57:29,429
He's all choked up.

1004
00:57:29,831 --> 00:57:32,064
- Must be love.
- Oh!

1005
00:57:32,066 --> 00:57:33,866
Macon... It's all right, Lena.

1006
00:57:33,868 --> 00:57:35,968
She can do no real harm here.

1007
00:57:35,970 --> 00:57:37,136
You sure about that, Macon?

1008
00:57:37,138 --> 00:57:39,071
Don't you sass your uncle, now!

1009
00:57:39,073 --> 00:57:41,807
Del, why don't you
get two place settings

1010
00:57:41,809 --> 00:57:42,975
for our uninvited guests?

1011
00:57:43,177 --> 00:57:44,210
Thank you.

1012
00:57:44,212 --> 00:57:46,779
You sit near me, sugar.

1013
00:57:46,781 --> 00:57:49,448
Sit right over here.

1014
00:57:50,150 --> 00:57:51,250
Sis?

1015
00:57:51,252 --> 00:57:52,518
Larkin!

1016
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:55,254
Ethan, this is my
younger brother Larkin.

1017
00:57:55,256 --> 00:57:57,957
I didn't think I'd be seeing you here.

1018
00:57:57,959 --> 00:57:59,325
And who is the stiff?

1019
00:57:59,327 --> 00:58:01,026
Larkin, meet Ethan Wate.

1020
00:58:01,028 --> 00:58:02,361
Well, well.

1021
00:58:03,564 --> 00:58:07,466
And this is our dear sweet gramma...

1022
00:58:07,468 --> 00:58:10,169
who we all just love to death.

1023
00:58:10,171 --> 00:58:13,005
We weren't expecting you, child.

1024
00:58:13,007 --> 00:58:15,307
Let me have a look at you.

1025
00:58:16,877 --> 00:58:21,380
Why is it, Ridley, that
when I look into your eyes,

1026
00:58:21,382 --> 00:58:23,415
all I can see are hers?

1027
00:58:23,417 --> 00:58:26,252
You two are as thick
as thieves, aren't you?

1028
00:58:26,254 --> 00:58:26,919
Mother!

1029
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:35,494
How about a little music,

1030
00:58:35,496 --> 00:58:39,531
and why don't we all just
sit down and enjoy ourselves?

1031
00:58:39,533 --> 00:58:41,869
And let's have some wine.

1032
00:58:43,271 --> 00:58:45,904
Something to drink?

1033
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:55,881
Here. Allow me.

1034
00:58:56,983 --> 00:58:58,984
Mama's homemade macaroons.

1035
00:58:58,986 --> 00:59:00,452
Oh!

1036
00:59:00,454 --> 00:59:01,720
I've missed these.

1037
00:59:01,722 --> 00:59:06,892
So, cuz, any big plans
for your birthday?

1038
00:59:06,894 --> 00:59:09,128
Nothing to concern yourself with.

1039
00:59:09,130 --> 00:59:10,763
You won't be invited, "cuz."

1040
00:59:10,765 --> 00:59:15,367
Well, Lena, darlin', you should.

1041
00:59:15,369 --> 00:59:17,136
Be concerned, that is.

1042
00:59:17,138 --> 00:59:18,370
Such an important birthday.

1043
00:59:18,372 --> 00:59:19,705
That's enough, Ridley.

1044
00:59:19,707 --> 00:59:22,608
I had hoped that we'd
have a holiday meal

1045
00:59:22,610 --> 00:59:25,210
that we would all survive.

1046
00:59:25,212 --> 00:59:26,812
What do you want?

1047
00:59:26,814 --> 00:59:29,181
Just to be with my family again, cuz.

1048
00:59:29,183 --> 00:59:31,684
You've been claimed by the dark.

1049
00:59:31,686 --> 00:59:34,253
You're no longer part of this family.

1050
00:59:34,255 --> 00:59:37,423
Ridley, sweetheart, there's
nothing we can do for you now.

1051
00:59:37,425 --> 00:59:38,957
I'm so sorry.

1052
00:59:38,959 --> 00:59:41,493
No hard feelings, mama.

1053
00:59:41,495 --> 00:59:43,562
But Lena and I are the same.

1054
00:59:43,564 --> 00:59:46,832
I wonder, when she goes dark...

1055
00:59:47,634 --> 00:59:49,268
...will you shut her out too?

1056
00:59:49,270 --> 00:59:50,769
That's enough.

1057
00:59:50,771 --> 00:59:54,006
You think you can keep
Lena so good, so innocent?

1058
00:59:54,008 --> 00:59:56,775
Wasn't I the same before I was claimed?

1059
00:59:56,777 --> 00:59:58,143
As I recall,

1060
00:59:58,145 --> 01:00:00,245
you were a spoiled brat from
the moment you were born.

1061
01:00:00,247 --> 01:00:01,781
Maybe I was just unloved.

1062
01:00:01,883 --> 01:00:05,751
I did the best I could.
And look at what I am now.

1063
01:00:06,053 --> 01:00:08,120
Oh, that's right. Blame the mother.

1064
01:00:08,122 --> 01:00:11,290
You think Lena is a good
girl now, but it won't matter.

1065
01:00:11,292 --> 01:00:14,493
Even if her true nature
doesn't claim her for the dark,

1066
01:00:14,495 --> 01:00:15,694
the curse will.

1067
01:00:15,696 --> 01:00:17,129
It's already started.

1068
01:00:17,131 --> 01:00:18,664
- I'm warning you.
- What curse?

1069
01:00:18,666 --> 01:00:20,399
Pay no mind to her lies.

1070
01:00:20,401 --> 01:00:22,000
You know it's true.

1071
01:00:23,337 --> 01:00:26,205
Aw, look at my manners.

1072
01:00:26,207 --> 01:00:27,506
Here, honey.

1073
01:00:27,508 --> 01:00:29,308
Let me serve you.

1074
01:00:30,311 --> 01:00:32,044
Get away from him!

1075
01:00:34,949 --> 01:00:36,849
Oh, really, cuz?

1076
01:00:46,025 --> 01:00:49,395
Lena, will you stop this?!

1077
01:00:51,064 --> 01:00:52,131
Stop it!

1078
01:00:55,469 --> 01:00:58,470
Aw, just another good
girl gone bad, I guess.

1079
01:00:58,472 --> 01:01:01,306
Lena, child, there's no need for this.

1080
01:01:01,308 --> 01:01:03,008
Will you stop this immediately?!

1081
01:01:04,578 --> 01:01:07,679
Breaking windows on poor,
helpless little mortals!

1082
01:01:07,681 --> 01:01:10,449
She's already closer
to the dark than I was!

1083
01:01:10,451 --> 01:01:11,717
You know that's a lie!

1084
01:01:11,719 --> 01:01:12,853
I want you out of here!

1085
01:01:14,855 --> 01:01:20,159
Ridley, don't make me
get up from this table!

1086
01:01:25,231 --> 01:01:27,266
I am so sick of everyone treating you

1087
01:01:27,268 --> 01:01:28,834
like you're something special!

1088
01:01:28,836 --> 01:01:31,336
There's nothing special about you!

1089
01:01:31,338 --> 01:01:33,305
Go on, you tell her, Macon!

1090
01:01:33,307 --> 01:01:35,741
You know how she will be claimed!

1091
01:01:35,743 --> 01:01:38,911
I said get away from
my boyfriend, you witch.

1092
01:01:50,323 --> 01:01:53,992
Oh, lord.

1093
01:02:02,268 --> 01:02:06,238
Boyfriend, huh?

1094
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:09,508
Is he gonna be all right?

1095
01:02:09,510 --> 01:02:11,743
He'll be fine.

1096
01:02:11,745 --> 01:02:14,646
What curse was Ridley talking about?

1097
01:02:14,648 --> 01:02:18,350
Ridley was just telling
stories to get your rage going,

1098
01:02:18,352 --> 01:02:19,618
to lose control.

1099
01:02:19,620 --> 01:02:23,422
You mustn't let her.

1100
01:02:23,424 --> 01:02:26,859
Larkin, help me take him to my room.

1101
01:02:26,861 --> 01:02:28,861
Oh, he will.

1102
01:02:32,565 --> 01:02:34,800
Sitting there eating
through a caster combat,

1103
01:02:34,802 --> 01:02:36,935
like you're two
sandwiches shy of a picnic.

1104
01:02:36,937 --> 01:02:39,171
<i>Better be a sandwich when I get back.</i>

1105
01:02:39,173 --> 01:02:40,506
I'm still hungry.

1106
01:02:40,508 --> 01:02:43,442
Do you see the way she looks at the boy?

1107
01:02:43,444 --> 01:02:46,245
There's no getting in between them now.

1108
01:02:46,247 --> 01:02:49,047
Then it <i>has</i> begun.

1109
01:03:03,796 --> 01:03:06,698
Hey there.

1110
01:03:08,101 --> 01:03:11,003
How do you feel?

1111
01:03:11,005 --> 01:03:13,939
Like I was in a tornado
inside a dining room.

1112
01:03:13,941 --> 01:03:15,941
No big deal.

1113
01:03:15,943 --> 01:03:19,444
I'm so sorry about Ridley.
I didn't know she was back.

1114
01:03:19,446 --> 01:03:20,646
Yeah.

1115
01:03:20,648 --> 01:03:23,549
She's sort of a bitch, isn't she?

1116
01:03:23,551 --> 01:03:26,051
She's a siren.

1117
01:03:26,053 --> 01:03:31,123
She can make mortals see, think,
or do whatever she wants...

1118
01:03:31,125 --> 01:03:33,759
especially men.

1119
01:03:33,761 --> 01:03:36,628
Isn't that, like, the
working definition of a bitch?

1120
01:03:36,630 --> 01:03:38,497
Mm-hmm.

1121
01:03:38,499 --> 01:03:42,267
She wasn't always like that.

1122
01:03:42,269 --> 01:03:44,937
We were like sisters.

1123
01:03:44,939 --> 01:03:46,171
You know?

1124
01:03:46,173 --> 01:03:50,742
Traveled together so much
we shared the same suitcase.

1125
01:03:50,744 --> 01:03:53,645
Did homework, watched Disney.

1126
01:03:53,647 --> 01:03:56,982
We were just kids.

1127
01:03:56,984 --> 01:04:01,119
<i>The night Ridley
turned 16, she ran away.</i>

1128
01:04:01,121 --> 01:04:04,890
<i>She said she could feel
herself turning dark.</i>

1129
01:04:04,892 --> 01:04:07,125
<i>She said she had to get away</i>

1130
01:04:07,127 --> 01:04:09,828
<i>before she hurt anybody she loved...</i>

1131
01:04:09,830 --> 01:04:12,497
<i>Before she hurt me.</i>

1132
01:04:12,499 --> 01:04:14,900
<i>I followed her.</i>

1133
01:04:14,902 --> 01:04:17,669
<i>Then it happened.</i>

1134
01:05:17,430 --> 01:05:21,400
<i>I saw it all.</i>

1135
01:05:54,701 --> 01:05:56,735
She loved me.

1136
01:05:56,737 --> 01:05:58,503
I know it.

1137
01:05:58,505 --> 01:06:00,338
It's not fair what happened to her.

1138
01:06:00,340 --> 01:06:03,208
And the same thing could happen to me.

1139
01:06:03,210 --> 01:06:04,443
It won't.

1140
01:06:04,445 --> 01:06:06,545
Did you see me tonight?

1141
01:06:06,547 --> 01:06:08,613
I can't control myself.

1142
01:06:08,615 --> 01:06:09,881
Lena, I don't believe

1143
01:06:09,883 --> 01:06:13,752
that we have one fate and no choice.

1144
01:06:13,754 --> 01:06:16,888
We make our own lives.

1145
01:06:19,558 --> 01:06:21,026
Two, please. Thank you.

1146
01:06:21,028 --> 01:06:22,894
- This is Lena.
- Lena.

1147
01:06:22,896 --> 01:06:24,196
- Hi, Lena.
- Hi.

1148
01:06:24,198 --> 01:06:26,364
Here. I got to give you the money.

1149
01:06:28,302 --> 01:06:30,635
Thanks.

1150
01:06:30,637 --> 01:06:32,871
There you go.

1151
01:06:32,873 --> 01:06:34,606
You good? Your kids are good?

1152
01:06:34,608 --> 01:06:35,607
Oh, yeah.

1153
01:06:35,609 --> 01:06:36,875
Good.

1154
01:06:38,879 --> 01:06:42,114
You got the tickets?

1155
01:06:42,116 --> 01:06:43,448
Hi.

1156
01:06:43,450 --> 01:06:44,449
Get a load of this.

1157
01:06:47,854 --> 01:06:51,723
You know, maybe you have
Ethan fooled, but not me.

1158
01:06:51,725 --> 01:06:52,558
Oh, shucks.

1159
01:06:53,860 --> 01:06:55,160
Ah, chill, girl.

1160
01:06:55,162 --> 01:06:58,029
Chill, chill.

1161
01:07:03,103 --> 01:07:05,270
See the look on her?

1162
01:07:06,073 --> 01:07:08,140
I see right through her.

1163
01:07:08,142 --> 01:07:11,276
Hi. Just, uh, just one, please.

1164
01:07:11,278 --> 01:07:12,944
Alrighty.

1165
01:07:14,781 --> 01:07:17,249
There you go.

1166
01:07:49,315 --> 01:07:53,218
Do not let them bother you, okay?

1167
01:07:55,822 --> 01:07:57,189
<i>Before we set out,</i>

1168
01:07:57,191 --> 01:07:58,490
<i>help yourselves to some scrambled eggs</i>

1169
01:07:58,492 --> 01:08:00,025
<i>and French toast right here...</i>

1170
01:08:00,027 --> 01:08:01,393
<i>You by yourself?</i>

1171
01:08:01,395 --> 01:08:03,028
<i>Yeah. I've been up since 5:00.</i>

1172
01:08:03,030 --> 01:08:05,096
<i>Feeling pretty good, though.</i>

1173
01:08:05,098 --> 01:08:05,897
Mm.

1174
01:08:05,899 --> 01:08:07,399
You want milk duds?

1175
01:08:07,401 --> 01:08:09,534
What do you put them in your pocket for?

1176
01:08:09,536 --> 01:08:12,537
I have to hide some for myself,
because Link never shares.

1177
01:08:14,074 --> 01:08:16,608
<i>All right. Yeah. I've been doing better.</i>

1178
01:08:16,610 --> 01:08:17,976
<i>...all by myself.</i>

1179
01:08:19,178 --> 01:08:20,278
I'm so sorry.

1180
01:08:20,280 --> 01:08:24,316
I didn't realize I had that.

1181
01:08:24,318 --> 01:08:26,251
No, it's okay.

1182
01:08:26,253 --> 01:08:27,018
I wanna see.

1183
01:08:28,055 --> 01:08:29,321
<i>Be right there.</i>

1184
01:08:44,738 --> 01:08:47,806
Yeah, whatever you can find!

1185
01:08:47,808 --> 01:08:49,307
There's gold in there and silver!

1186
01:08:49,309 --> 01:08:50,342
Get it all!

1187
01:08:50,344 --> 01:08:53,778
Hurry up before it's all gone!

1188
01:09:07,895 --> 01:09:10,061
Ethan!

1189
01:09:11,865 --> 01:09:15,000
Ethan!

1190
01:09:15,002 --> 01:09:15,867
Don't you dare...

1191
01:09:15,869 --> 01:09:17,535
Okay. Don't you dare go anywhere.

1192
01:09:17,537 --> 01:09:21,640
Don't you dare, Ethan carter Wate!

1193
01:09:21,642 --> 01:09:25,377
Come back. Wait, Ethan.

1194
01:09:35,021 --> 01:09:38,089
Body of my body, marrow and mind,

1195
01:09:38,091 --> 01:09:41,026
soul of my soul, to our spirit bind,

1196
01:09:41,028 --> 01:09:43,328
blood of my heart, my tide, my moon,

1197
01:09:43,330 --> 01:09:48,366
blood of my heart,
my salvation, my doom!

1198
01:09:50,604 --> 01:09:52,570
Genevieve.

1199
01:09:53,940 --> 01:09:56,274
Was I shot?

1200
01:09:56,276 --> 01:09:58,276
What happened to your eyes?

1201
01:10:29,442 --> 01:10:30,709
Form up, company!

1202
01:10:36,450 --> 01:10:39,084
<i>Oh, my darling Lena,</i>

1203
01:10:39,086 --> 01:10:42,253
<i>do you see now how you must be claimed?</i>

1204
01:10:42,255 --> 01:10:45,156
<i>We are the descendants of Genevieve.</i>

1205
01:10:45,158 --> 01:10:48,426
<i>Her dark power is in our blood!</i>

1206
01:10:48,428 --> 01:10:51,363
<i>Oh, how I've missed you, my daughter.</i>

1207
01:10:51,365 --> 01:10:55,300
<i>Your mother, Sarafine,
has come home for you.</i>

1208
01:10:57,771 --> 01:11:00,171
Guess Satan hates sequels, too.

1209
01:11:11,517 --> 01:11:14,719
It's over.

1210
01:11:19,860 --> 01:11:21,292
There is no more.

1211
01:11:21,294 --> 01:11:24,329
It's served its purpose.

1212
01:11:26,865 --> 01:11:27,766
Lena?

1213
01:11:27,768 --> 01:11:31,136
The curse began with your
great-great-great grandmother,

1214
01:11:31,138 --> 01:11:33,605
Genevieve Katherine Duchannes.

1215
01:11:33,607 --> 01:11:37,142
She had the temerity to
fall in love with a mortal,

1216
01:11:37,144 --> 01:11:40,045
your ancestor, Ethan Carter Wate.

1217
01:11:40,047 --> 01:11:42,080
In 1864, he deserted.

1218
01:11:42,082 --> 01:11:44,482
Came home to his Genevieve.

1219
01:11:44,484 --> 01:11:46,117
But he was killed in front of her eyes,

1220
01:11:46,119 --> 01:11:47,752
by Union soldiers

1221
01:11:47,754 --> 01:11:51,389
who were ransacking greenbrier
during the battle of Honey Hill.

1222
01:11:51,391 --> 01:11:54,325
And in her madness, in her grief,

1223
01:11:54,327 --> 01:11:57,896
She used a spell that
is forbidden to us.

1224
01:11:57,898 --> 01:12:00,031
To bring him back to life.

1225
01:12:00,033 --> 01:12:03,201
A spell that left a curse?

1226
01:12:03,203 --> 01:12:05,336
No caster may reverse death.

1227
01:12:05,338 --> 01:12:08,573
So she lost her soul,
consumed by darkness forever.

1228
01:12:08,575 --> 01:12:10,575
But the spell worked.

1229
01:12:10,577 --> 01:12:12,410
If Genevieve loved
him, why'd she kill him?

1230
01:12:12,412 --> 01:12:14,179
In that kind of darkness,

1231
01:12:14,181 --> 01:12:16,848
there's not even a memory
of love, only power.

1232
01:12:16,850 --> 01:12:20,418
Everything has a price.

1233
01:12:35,501 --> 01:12:38,269
You told me my mother was dead.

1234
01:12:38,271 --> 01:12:39,737
You lied to me.

1235
01:12:39,739 --> 01:12:40,872
Why?

1236
01:12:40,874 --> 01:12:42,006
- Why?!
- Lena!

1237
01:12:42,008 --> 01:12:43,208
Our words, our language

1238
01:12:43,210 --> 01:12:45,176
cannot explain all that there is.

1239
01:12:45,178 --> 01:12:47,178
There are other ways
someone can die to us.

1240
01:12:47,180 --> 01:12:48,379
No, I'll tell her.

1241
01:12:48,381 --> 01:12:50,281
Your mother, Sarafine,

1242
01:12:50,283 --> 01:12:54,152
is the most powerful
dark caster of all of us.

1243
01:12:54,154 --> 01:12:57,622
She lives in the
darkness, in the shadows.

1244
01:12:57,624 --> 01:13:01,092
If she does appear, it's in
the guise of someone else.

1245
01:13:01,094 --> 01:13:03,661
She has no love for you.

1246
01:13:03,663 --> 01:13:05,864
That's what I was trying
to protect you from.

1247
01:13:05,866 --> 01:13:08,733
So I'm gonna be claimed
for the dark no matter what?

1248
01:13:08,735 --> 01:13:10,602
No, not necessarily.

1249
01:13:10,604 --> 01:13:13,171
I know your true nature. It's strong.

1250
01:13:13,173 --> 01:13:15,140
Sarafine recognizes it too.

1251
01:13:15,142 --> 01:13:17,308
She knows that without the curse,

1252
01:13:17,310 --> 01:13:20,545
your true nature would
claim you for the light.

1253
01:13:20,547 --> 01:13:23,214
No. I believe the curse can be broken.

1254
01:13:23,216 --> 01:13:26,050
But you need to have
a will that's so strong

1255
01:13:26,052 --> 01:13:28,119
you control your own nature.

1256
01:13:28,121 --> 01:13:29,354
That's what I told her.

1257
01:13:29,356 --> 01:13:32,123
The first thing you have to do
is to get rid of him. Wait. What?

1258
01:13:32,125 --> 01:13:33,959
Sarafine's using you. That's not true!

1259
01:13:33,961 --> 01:13:35,026
Listen to me, Lena.

1260
01:13:35,328 --> 01:13:36,394
No, listen to me, Lena.

1261
01:13:36,396 --> 01:13:37,595
Ethan, Macon's right!

1262
01:13:37,597 --> 01:13:39,330
If you're to break this curse,

1263
01:13:39,332 --> 01:13:40,899
you have to control your emotions.

1264
01:13:40,901 --> 01:13:44,002
And loving this boy puts
you in terrible danger!

1265
01:13:44,004 --> 01:13:46,804
How could you know?
You never loved anyone.

1266
01:13:46,806 --> 01:13:48,640
You despise mortals.

1267
01:13:48,642 --> 01:13:52,010
You never even had a
friend, even in our world.

1268
01:13:52,012 --> 01:13:53,745
How could you know?

1269
01:13:56,615 --> 01:14:01,619
I know that no good can
come from us loving a mortal.

1270
01:14:03,155 --> 01:14:04,622
Lena, listen to me.

1271
01:14:04,624 --> 01:14:07,158
There's got to be a way,
another way to break the curse.

1272
01:14:07,660 --> 01:14:08,726
Macon!

1273
01:14:08,728 --> 01:14:11,563
Don't even think that, young man!

1274
01:14:11,565 --> 01:14:13,665
You'll get the both of you killed.

1275
01:14:13,667 --> 01:14:15,900
You have to get out of her life.

1276
01:14:15,902 --> 01:14:18,336
Do you hear me?

1277
01:14:21,006 --> 01:14:24,943
Lena... Say your goodbyes.

1278
01:14:32,418 --> 01:14:35,019
<i>Macon's keeping Lena at Ravenwood.</i>

1279
01:14:35,021 --> 01:14:36,688
<i>He won't let me see her.</i>

1280
01:14:36,690 --> 01:14:40,124
<i>He thinks keeping us apart
is the best thing for her.</i>

1281
01:14:40,126 --> 01:14:41,726
<i>But he's wrong.</i>

1282
01:14:41,728 --> 01:14:42,727
<i>I know Lena.</i>

1283
01:14:42,729 --> 01:14:45,530
<i>I know her like I know myself.</i>

1284
01:14:45,532 --> 01:14:47,832
<i>And I can feel her slipping away</i>

1285
01:14:47,834 --> 01:14:50,935
<i>into some place where I can't reach her.</i>

1286
01:15:04,116 --> 01:15:06,951
<i>Go away! Go away!</i>

1287
01:15:06,953 --> 01:15:10,021
<i>Go away! Go away!</i>

1288
01:15:17,696 --> 01:15:18,763
Hi, dear.

1289
01:15:18,765 --> 01:15:20,131
Hello, Mrs. Lincoln.

1290
01:15:20,133 --> 01:15:21,099
Hi, dear.

1291
01:15:21,101 --> 01:15:22,400
Hi. Just a minute.

1292
01:15:24,337 --> 01:15:26,304
Oh, dear.

1293
01:15:26,306 --> 01:15:28,906
This door seems to be stuck.

1294
01:15:28,908 --> 01:15:31,376
It's just these old houses.
They're such a nuisance.

1295
01:15:31,378 --> 01:15:32,377
Yes, ma'am.

1296
01:15:32,379 --> 01:15:33,178
They warp.

1297
01:15:33,380 --> 01:15:34,579
Link's not here.

1298
01:15:34,581 --> 01:15:36,114
Oh, I know. I know.

1299
01:15:36,116 --> 01:15:37,582
He's at savannah snow's party,

1300
01:15:37,584 --> 01:15:39,284
which is where all the kids are.

1301
01:15:39,286 --> 01:15:42,020
I had to make quite a
number of phone calls

1302
01:15:42,022 --> 01:15:44,956
to get him an invitation
on account of his...

1303
01:15:44,958 --> 01:15:47,825
Well, on account of
his friendship with you.

1304
01:15:47,827 --> 01:15:51,029
Um, I'm sorry you had to
go to that trouble, ma'am.

1305
01:15:51,031 --> 01:15:53,564
Well, you should be
at that party, Ethan,

1306
01:15:53,566 --> 01:15:55,833
kicking up your heels
with your real friends,

1307
01:15:55,835 --> 01:15:58,503
with the children who
belong in this town.

1308
01:15:58,505 --> 01:16:00,438
I'm not much up for a
party tonight, ma'am.

1309
01:16:00,440 --> 01:16:01,739
Oh, well, that's a shame.

1310
01:16:01,741 --> 01:16:04,976
Well, see, I-I made you some brownies.

1311
01:16:04,978 --> 01:16:09,247
I thought maybe I could
come in and we could talk.

1312
01:16:09,249 --> 01:16:11,783
My fight's not with you, son.

1313
01:16:11,785 --> 01:16:14,185
It's not. Never has been.

1314
01:16:14,187 --> 01:16:17,455
It's just that girl with
her seductive quirkiness,

1315
01:16:17,457 --> 01:16:19,757
and you being motherless and all.

1316
01:16:19,759 --> 01:16:21,592
May I come in?

1317
01:16:24,863 --> 01:16:25,863
No, ma'am.

1318
01:16:25,865 --> 01:16:27,565
I-I-I don't
think so.

1319
01:16:27,567 --> 01:16:30,368
Did I hear you...

1320
01:16:30,370 --> 01:16:32,303
Correctly just then, Ethan?

1321
01:16:32,305 --> 01:16:34,472
Do I have to ask you again?

1322
01:16:34,474 --> 01:16:37,008
May I come in?

1323
01:16:37,010 --> 01:16:39,510
No, ma'am, you may not.

1324
01:16:39,512 --> 01:16:41,846
But I have made you brownies!

1325
01:16:41,848 --> 01:16:45,049
I-I've made you brownies from scratch!

1326
01:16:49,422 --> 01:16:54,359
Oh, well, slap my ass and call me sally!

1327
01:16:56,062 --> 01:16:58,396
Lena bound your house.

1328
01:16:58,398 --> 01:17:00,865
Oh, that's so sweet.

1329
01:17:02,267 --> 01:17:04,936
As if.

1330
01:17:04,938 --> 01:17:06,637
I'm on your side, son.

1331
01:17:06,639 --> 01:17:09,574
What's a little curse
when it comes to true love?

1332
01:17:09,576 --> 01:17:11,008
Anyone can see

1333
01:17:11,010 --> 01:17:13,711
you and Lena are just
meant for each other,

1334
01:17:13,713 --> 01:17:16,180
till death do you part!

1335
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:08,332
Lena?

1336
01:18:13,772 --> 01:18:15,973
Get out of this house.

1337
01:18:15,975 --> 01:18:18,643
L-Lena.

1338
01:18:20,412 --> 01:18:22,914
Keep her bound.

1339
01:18:22,916 --> 01:18:25,183
Lena.

1340
01:18:26,919 --> 01:18:28,653
Lena, can we please just go outside

1341
01:18:28,655 --> 01:18:30,021
for one second and talk?

1342
01:18:30,023 --> 01:18:31,222
I need --
get out!

1343
01:18:31,224 --> 01:18:32,323
No!

1344
01:18:32,325 --> 01:18:34,559
Please, son, for your own good.

1345
01:18:35,861 --> 01:18:37,628
You should really listen to them.

1346
01:18:38,263 --> 01:18:39,464
No!

1347
01:18:40,532 --> 01:18:44,001
I'm sick of listening to your family.

1348
01:18:44,003 --> 01:18:47,805
I have been chased, spun, hypnotized,

1349
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:51,042
paralyzed, and damn near
killed by your family.

1350
01:18:51,044 --> 01:18:53,511
I've been going out of my
mind for the last two weeks.

1351
01:18:53,513 --> 01:18:55,379
And now your mother
shows up on my doorstep

1352
01:18:55,381 --> 01:18:57,081
and damn near gives me a heart attack!

1353
01:18:57,083 --> 01:18:58,149
But you know what?

1354
01:18:58,151 --> 01:19:00,751
I don't care about
them, about the curse.

1355
01:19:00,753 --> 01:19:03,654
You are not going dark
and you are not losing me.

1356
01:19:03,656 --> 01:19:06,257
No matter what you do, no
matter what they do to me,

1357
01:19:06,259 --> 01:19:07,425
I'm still here.

1358
01:19:07,427 --> 01:19:09,727
Now, what does that tell you?

1359
01:19:11,763 --> 01:19:13,898
How could the boy break our spell?

1360
01:19:13,900 --> 01:19:15,066
He has no power.

1361
01:19:16,835 --> 01:19:21,739
It's not we who protect
her now. It's the boy.

1362
01:19:28,647 --> 01:19:30,515
Amma, we need your help.

1363
01:19:32,384 --> 01:19:33,718
Why come to me?

1364
01:19:33,720 --> 01:19:36,287
The way you talked about the locket,

1365
01:19:36,289 --> 01:19:38,356
about the curse.

1366
01:19:38,358 --> 01:19:39,724
Excuse me, miss Amma,

1367
01:19:39,726 --> 01:19:41,659
but I think you know
more than you're saying.

1368
01:19:44,062 --> 01:19:47,164
Please, Amma.

1369
01:19:49,301 --> 01:19:52,570
This isn't the place you're
gonna find anything you need.

1370
01:19:52,572 --> 01:19:54,739
Meet me in the back.

1371
01:20:25,504 --> 01:20:27,772
This must run under the whole town.

1372
01:20:27,774 --> 01:20:29,173
The whole country.

1373
01:20:29,175 --> 01:20:32,677
Gatlin is like the
capital of caster America.

1374
01:20:32,679 --> 01:20:34,845
It used to be under Washington, D.C.,

1375
01:20:34,847 --> 01:20:36,781
until Nancy Reagan made them move.

1376
01:20:36,783 --> 01:20:39,750
She was the only mortal
they were ever scared of.

1377
01:20:55,834 --> 01:20:58,169
They know a caster's here.

1378
01:20:59,905 --> 01:21:02,573
Amma, why didn't you tell us about this?

1379
01:21:02,575 --> 01:21:05,042
A keeper has to be asked.

1380
01:21:05,044 --> 01:21:07,745
A keeper, as in you're a...

1381
01:21:07,747 --> 01:21:10,514
The caster library has
been the responsibility

1382
01:21:10,516 --> 01:21:14,118
Of seers like me for generations.

1383
01:21:15,854 --> 01:21:19,857
Something I had no choice
about either, by the way.

1384
01:21:19,859 --> 01:21:23,761
And these books hold the
histories of the casters

1385
01:21:23,763 --> 01:21:25,262
from around the world,

1386
01:21:25,264 --> 01:21:28,366
the laws that keep balance
between light and dark.

1387
01:21:28,368 --> 01:21:30,935
Hey! Get away from that!

1388
01:21:30,937 --> 01:21:32,536
Macon comes here every day

1389
01:21:32,538 --> 01:21:36,273
and reads every book he
can for the forbidden spell.

1390
01:21:36,275 --> 01:21:37,708
He found nothing?

1391
01:21:37,710 --> 01:21:39,777
Mnh-mnh.

1392
01:21:39,779 --> 01:21:42,513
But you can do it.

1393
01:21:42,515 --> 01:21:44,348
God gives us what we can handle,

1394
01:21:44,350 --> 01:21:47,318
even if we don't believe it ourselves.

1395
01:21:49,221 --> 01:21:51,355
Close your eyes.

1396
01:21:52,958 --> 01:21:55,593
See with your mind
what you're looking for

1397
01:21:55,595 --> 01:21:58,963
as if you've already found it.

1398
01:22:09,374 --> 01:22:11,208
I knew it.

1399
01:22:14,646 --> 01:22:16,213
"book of moons."

1400
01:22:16,215 --> 01:22:18,649
It's the most powerful
book of the otherworld.

1401
01:22:18,651 --> 01:22:19,917
It's as alive as you or me.

1402
01:22:19,919 --> 01:22:22,153
Strongest of every spells, good and bad.

1403
01:22:22,155 --> 01:22:24,655
- Did Macon look through it?
- No. He couldn't.

1404
01:22:24,657 --> 01:22:26,557
The book chooses who reads it.

1405
01:22:26,559 --> 01:22:28,726
Its law is "like attracts like."

1406
01:22:33,265 --> 01:22:34,465
There...

1407
01:22:34,467 --> 01:22:36,200
There's no writing.

1408
01:22:36,202 --> 01:22:38,235
Oh, it won't reveal itself so easy.

1409
01:22:38,237 --> 01:22:41,505
A curse this dark takes
its time showing itself.

1410
01:22:41,507 --> 01:22:43,908
The dark will test you.

1411
01:22:43,910 --> 01:22:45,409
Don't worry. You'll find it.

1412
01:22:45,411 --> 01:22:49,513
Just look under "how not
to turn into your mother."

1413
01:22:54,654 --> 01:22:55,820
Come on.

1414
01:22:55,822 --> 01:22:58,189
Come on.

1415
01:23:23,415 --> 01:23:26,684
<i>I've been taking Lena
to the caster library</i>

1416
01:23:26,686 --> 01:23:28,853
<i>for weeks now.</i>

1417
01:23:32,090 --> 01:23:34,625
<i>But Lena's getting discouraged.</i>

1418
01:23:34,627 --> 01:23:39,063
<i>The longer this thing takes,
the more I see a change in her.</i>

1419
01:24:00,252 --> 01:24:02,119
We'll-- we'll
find a way, okay?

1420
01:24:02,121 --> 01:24:04,588
You're just a mortal.
How would you know?

1421
01:24:04,590 --> 01:24:05,689
Hey, I can make wind.

1422
01:24:05,691 --> 01:24:07,258
Maybe not a
hurricane, but I --

1423
01:24:07,260 --> 01:24:08,859
Why don't we just admit it?

1424
01:24:08,861 --> 01:24:10,561
A-admit what?

1425
01:24:10,563 --> 01:24:12,229
It's already started.

1426
01:24:12,231 --> 01:24:13,615
I'm turning into a dark bitch.

1427
01:24:13,616 --> 01:24:15,199
- I can feel it.
-  No, no, no.

1428
01:24:15,201 --> 01:24:18,302
Lena, you're just
stressed. It's not --

1429
01:24:18,304 --> 01:24:21,272
It doesn't matter what causes it.

1430
01:24:21,274 --> 01:24:25,009
I'm turning, and you're
just too stupid to see it.

1431
01:24:25,011 --> 01:24:26,778
Okay, now you're a bitch.

1432
01:24:36,655 --> 01:24:39,723
Really? Is this necessary?

1433
01:24:39,725 --> 01:24:41,792
I'm agreeing with you!

1434
01:24:42,594 --> 01:24:43,427
Okay.

1435
01:24:43,429 --> 01:24:46,130
I'm just a dumbass mortal who
can't make his own thunder.

1436
01:24:46,132 --> 01:24:48,332
But I know there's no way
we're gonna figure this out

1437
01:24:48,334 --> 01:24:50,801
Unless you stop feeling
so damn sorry for yourself

1438
01:24:50,803 --> 01:24:51,836
all the time!

1439
01:24:51,838 --> 01:24:53,204
Go ahead!

1440
01:24:53,206 --> 01:24:55,272
Start an earthquake.
See where it gets you.

1441
01:24:55,274 --> 01:24:58,509
Everybody has to deal with
shit in their lives, Lena.

1442
01:24:58,511 --> 01:25:01,078
What are you yelling at me for?!

1443
01:25:01,080 --> 01:25:02,880
You want to be a normal human?

1444
01:25:02,882 --> 01:25:04,615
What do you think that is?

1445
01:25:04,617 --> 01:25:08,252
We don't have powers to just
change things whenever we like.

1446
01:25:08,254 --> 01:25:09,887
Being human is feeling bad!

1447
01:25:09,889 --> 01:25:12,456
It's feeling pissed off!

1448
01:25:12,458 --> 01:25:13,624
It's feeling scared

1449
01:25:13,626 --> 01:25:15,326
and not being able to
do anything about it

1450
01:25:15,328 --> 01:25:17,094
until you don't feel that way anymore,

1451
01:25:17,096 --> 01:25:19,096
until you can just
see your way out of it.

1452
01:25:19,098 --> 01:25:21,932
And I yelled at you
because I care about you.

1453
01:25:21,934 --> 01:25:24,935
That's what normal people
do who love each other

1454
01:25:24,937 --> 01:25:27,304
when one of them is acting like a brat!

1455
01:25:27,306 --> 01:25:30,407
Now, would you please
stop raining on me?

if you are not a caster"
don't you understand?

1476
01:27:21,519 --> 01:27:24,188
There were casters in the Civil War?

1477
01:27:24,190 --> 01:27:27,491
Casters have been fighting
alongside mortals for centuries,

1478
01:27:27,493 --> 01:27:28,826
every war, every side.

1479
01:27:28,828 --> 01:27:31,095

don't make them any smarter.

01:27:33,866 --> 01:27:35,666
Is you go to church every Sunday?

1482
01:27:35,668 --> 01:27:37,267
Mm-hmm.

1483
01:27:37,269 --> 01:27:39,970
How do you believe in all
this and still believe in god?

1484
01:27:39,972 --> 01:27:41,572
God created all things, didn't he?

1485
01:27:41,574 --> 01:27:44,575
It's only men that go and
decide which ones are mistakes.

1486
01:27:51,583 --> 01:27:55,285
My mom came here, didn't she?

1487
01:27:58,990 --> 01:28:00,724
With Macon?

1488
01:28:04,262 --> 01:28:07,364
They met here many times.

1489
01:28:07,366 --> 01:28:10,334
Macon loved teaching
her about his world.

1490
01:28:17,375 --> 01:28:19,610
Macon loved her, didn't he?

1491
01:28:19,612 --> 01:28:23,614
No one knows what Macon
can and can't feel, but...

1492
01:28:23,616 --> 01:28:25,315
Lila sure got close.

1493
01:28:26,818 --> 01:28:29,586
Ethan?

1494
01:28:29,588 --> 01:28:31,588
She loved your father.

1495
01:28:46,137 --> 01:28:48,105
You going somewhere?

1496
01:28:48,107 --> 01:28:50,407
Wherever Lena is.

1497
01:28:50,409 --> 01:28:53,777
Even if that's in Gatlin.

1498
01:28:53,779 --> 01:28:55,379
What are you doing here?

1499
01:28:55,381 --> 01:29:00,217
I don't know what power you
have over Lena, but, uh...

1500
01:29:00,219 --> 01:29:04,955
I've come to ask you to... Let her go.

1501
01:29:04,957 --> 01:29:07,558
I don't have any power, Macon.

1502
01:29:07,560 --> 01:29:08,859
I just love her.

1503
01:29:08,861 --> 01:29:11,695
Then just put an end to it.

1504
01:29:12,764 --> 01:29:13,664
I can't.

1505
01:29:14,266 --> 01:29:15,899
Even if it means destroying

1506
01:29:15,901 --> 01:29:18,001
the Lena you love?

1507
01:29:18,003 --> 01:29:19,136
Hm?

1508
01:29:19,138 --> 01:29:20,404
It can't, because there's no way

1509
01:29:20,406 --> 01:29:22,473
that what Lena and I feel for each other

1510
01:29:22,475 --> 01:29:26,243
Is gonna turn into
something wrong or evil.

1511
01:29:26,245 --> 01:29:27,845
There's no way.

1512
01:29:27,847 --> 01:29:31,381
As long as I live, I'll never
understand you creatures.

1513
01:29:31,383 --> 01:29:34,518
You have no real power.

1514
01:29:34,520 --> 01:29:38,322
You live at the mercy of
forces outside your control...

1515
01:29:38,324 --> 01:29:43,393
And yet you <i>believe</i> that what you feel

1516
01:29:43,395 --> 01:29:46,330
will somehow make it all right.

1517
01:29:46,332 --> 01:29:49,399
Gotta have some faith, Macon.

1518
01:30:56,434 --> 01:30:58,268
Lena?

1519
01:30:58,270 --> 01:30:59,870
You okay?

1520
01:31:03,943 --> 01:31:05,609
Lena?

1521
01:31:11,015 --> 01:31:12,816
Lena?

1522
01:31:12,818 --> 01:31:13,750
Yeah?

1523
01:31:13,752 --> 01:31:15,185
I-is something wrong?

1524
01:31:15,187 --> 01:31:18,488
No! I-I think I found something.

1525
01:31:18,490 --> 01:31:21,792
Yeah? What? Let, l-let me see.

1526
01:31:21,794 --> 01:31:23,126
Well, it's a lot to read

1527
01:31:23,128 --> 01:31:28,765
and a lot to take in, and
I really got to concentrate.

1528
01:31:28,767 --> 01:31:30,500
Okay.

1529
01:31:30,502 --> 01:31:34,171
So I was wondering...

1530
01:31:35,741 --> 01:31:38,141
Well, I've gotta do
it on my own, kind of.

1531
01:31:38,143 --> 01:31:42,179
You know, and if you're here,
you're just gonna distract me.

1532
01:31:42,181 --> 01:31:43,413
And I was wondering

1533
01:31:43,415 --> 01:31:45,782
if you wouldn't mind going home now.

1534
01:31:45,784 --> 01:31:50,821
And then, when I'm done,
I'll call you later.

1535
01:31:52,090 --> 01:31:54,625
Is that okay?

1536
01:31:54,627 --> 01:31:57,461
Sure.

1537
01:31:57,463 --> 01:32:00,063
Whatever you want, okay?

1538
01:32:00,065 --> 01:32:02,666
Thanks.

1539
01:32:03,401 --> 01:32:05,469
I love you.

1540
01:32:07,272 --> 01:32:10,040
Okay. I'll talk to you later.

1541
01:32:26,524 --> 01:32:28,058
Lena?

1542
01:32:28,060 --> 01:32:29,493
He's gone.

1543
01:32:39,904 --> 01:32:42,572
It's okay.

1544
01:32:42,574 --> 01:32:44,641
Shh.

1545
01:32:55,253 --> 01:32:57,788
Talk to me.

1546
01:32:57,790 --> 01:32:59,423
Lena.

1547
01:33:03,728 --> 01:33:07,631
There's only one way to break the curse.

1548
01:33:07,633 --> 01:33:12,602
Genevieve used the forbidden spell...

1549
01:33:12,604 --> 01:33:16,506
to give life to the one she loved.

1550
01:33:16,508 --> 01:33:20,177
To break the curse,
the one that I love...

1551
01:33:20,179 --> 01:33:23,046
has to die.

1552
01:33:23,048 --> 01:33:25,682
Oh, god.

1553
01:33:25,684 --> 01:33:28,452
What are you gonna do?

1554
01:33:31,556 --> 01:33:34,858
I won't hurt Ethan.

1555
01:33:34,860 --> 01:33:36,793
Never.

1556
01:33:38,596 --> 01:33:40,964
They're only our words, Amma.

1557
01:33:40,966 --> 01:33:44,534
They can't explain everything.

1558
01:33:44,536 --> 01:33:49,873
There are all kinds of ways
someone you love can die.

1559
01:33:51,008 --> 01:33:54,010
- That's all the book said?
- Yeah.

1560
01:33:54,012 --> 01:33:56,213
All it said was to reverse the curse,

1561
01:33:56,215 --> 01:33:57,914
I need to do these certain rituals,

1562
01:33:57,916 --> 01:34:00,250
caster stuff, every night and every day

1563
01:34:00,252 --> 01:34:01,785
right up until the claiming.

1564
01:34:01,787 --> 01:34:03,620
And whatever happens, happens.

1565
01:34:03,622 --> 01:34:06,923
Hey, we know what's gonna happen.

1566
01:34:06,925 --> 01:34:09,226
I want you to do something for me.

1567
01:34:09,228 --> 01:34:10,861
Between now and my birthday,

1568
01:34:10,863 --> 01:34:12,596
I don't want to think
about the claiming.

1569
01:34:12,598 --> 01:34:14,531
See? No tattoo.

1570
01:34:14,533 --> 01:34:16,666
I just want to be with you

1571
01:34:16,668 --> 01:34:19,770
- and do normal boyfriend-girlfriend stuff.
- Great.

1572
01:34:19,772 --> 01:34:23,707
Well, how about tonight is,
uh, the Christmas dance and...

1573
01:34:23,709 --> 01:34:25,942
You could be my
date. It's p--

1574
01:34:25,944 --> 01:34:29,146
Is Ethan Wate asking me to the dance?

1575
01:34:29,148 --> 01:34:30,480
Oh, my god!

1576
01:34:30,482 --> 01:34:32,149
I'm thinking about it.

1577
01:34:33,585 --> 01:34:35,552
No, they've got piss punch

1578
01:34:35,554 --> 01:34:37,921
and the chaperones guarding
the make-out stairs.

1579
01:34:37,923 --> 01:34:39,823
It is god-awful.

1580
01:34:40,725 --> 01:34:42,392
Sounds perfect.

1581
01:34:47,665 --> 01:34:50,133
I still don't know what to get you.

1582
01:34:50,135 --> 01:34:51,501
Huh?

1583
01:34:51,503 --> 01:34:54,337
I mean, we-- we don't
celebrate Christmas.

1584
01:34:56,775 --> 01:35:01,144
What do you wish for every
year that you never get?

1585
01:35:07,820 --> 01:35:09,920
Oh, well, no.

1586
01:35:11,223 --> 01:35:13,023
No, it's not-- you're
gonna think I'm so not cool.

1587
01:35:13,025 --> 01:35:15,325
That's okay. I don't
think you're cool now.

1588
01:35:24,837 --> 01:35:26,837
Snow.

1589
01:35:26,839 --> 01:35:28,438
Really?

1590
01:35:28,840 --> 01:35:29,773
Yeah?

1591
01:35:29,775 --> 01:35:31,374
Well, you know
what? I just --

1592
01:35:31,376 --> 01:35:34,678
I always wanted one of those...
W-white movie Christmases.

1593
01:35:34,680 --> 01:35:36,813
I mean, look at this.
This is, like, pathetic.

1594
01:35:36,815 --> 01:35:37,915
This ain't Christmas.

1595
01:35:38,517 --> 01:35:40,450
You know that set-up's too easy.

1596
01:35:40,452 --> 01:35:42,586
Yeah, I know.

1597
01:35:42,588 --> 01:35:46,356
That's what you really want?

Ethan!

01:37:06,671 --> 01:37:09,072
Did you come home late
from the dance last night?

1618
01:37:09,074 --> 01:37:10,206
Um...

1619
01:37:10,208 --> 01:37:12,042
Can you get this turkey
out of the refrigerator?

1620
01:37:12,044 --> 01:37:13,610
Yeah.

1621
01:37:13,612 --> 01:37:16,479
I don't, uh, I don't remember.

1622
01:37:16,481 --> 01:37:19,182
I must have been pretty tired.

1623
01:37:19,184 --> 01:37:22,419
But I slept real good for
the first time in a long time.

Oh, that's good. Lena
coming over for Christmas?

1625
01:37:25,624 --> 01:37:27,057
We got enough food.

1626
01:37:27,059 --> 01:37:28,525
Lena?

1627
01:37:28,527 --> 01:37:30,727
Lena Duchannes.

1628
01:37:30,729 --> 01:37:32,228
Lena Duchannes?

1629
01:37:32,230 --> 01:37:34,264
Why would I invite Lena
Duchannes over for dinner?

1630
01:37:34,266 --> 01:37:35,632
I barely know her.

1631
01:37:35,634 --> 01:37:37,500
She doesn't speak to anybody at school.

1632
01:37:37,502 --> 01:37:39,002
Do you know her?

1633
01:37:43,174 --> 01:37:46,176
Emily's mom says she was
in a mental institution.

1634
01:37:46,178 --> 01:37:48,511
I don't know whether I
trust what Emily's mom says,

1635
01:37:48,513 --> 01:37:50,046
but she's kind of a weird girl.

1636
01:37:50,048 --> 01:37:53,116
Hey, except for that damn
Civil War thing and meals,

1637
01:37:53,118 --> 01:37:56,186
I'm staying in my bed
the entire winter break.

1638
01:38:03,227 --> 01:38:06,529
I don't want to preach today.

1639
01:38:06,531 --> 01:38:12,135
Instead, I just want to talk to you.

1640
01:38:12,137 --> 01:38:15,772
About a word we don't
hear much anymore --

1641
01:38:15,774 --> 01:38:18,308
Sacrifice.

1642
01:38:18,310 --> 01:38:21,344
It's not what I'd call a modern word.

1643
01:38:21,346 --> 01:38:24,848
People hear the word "sacrifice"
and they become afraid

1644
01:38:24,850 --> 01:38:27,751
that something will be
taken away from them.

1645
01:38:27,753 --> 01:38:29,486
Or they'll have to give up something

1646
01:38:29,488 --> 01:38:31,955
they can't live without.

1647
01:38:31,957 --> 01:38:35,358
"sacrifice," to them, means "loss,"

1648
01:38:35,360 --> 01:38:39,763
In a world telling
us we can have it all.

1649
01:38:39,765 --> 01:38:43,099
But I believe true sacrifice...

1650
01:38:43,101 --> 01:38:44,934
is a victory.

1651
01:38:44,936 --> 01:38:48,405
Because it requires our free will,

1652
01:38:48,407 --> 01:38:52,142
to give up something
or someone you love,

1653
01:38:52,144 --> 01:38:57,881
for something or someone
you love more than yourself.

1654
01:38:57,883 --> 01:38:59,516
I won't lie
to you --

1655
01:38:59,518 --> 01:39:02,252
It's a gamble.

1656
01:39:02,254 --> 01:39:05,422
Sacrifice won't take
away the pain of loss.

1657
01:39:05,424 --> 01:39:08,091
But it wins the battle
against bitterness.

1658
01:39:08,093 --> 01:39:10,427
The bitterness that dims the light

1659
01:39:10,429 --> 01:39:13,897
on all that is of true
value in our lives.

1660
01:39:49,300 --> 01:39:51,968
What do we do now, Auntie Sarafine?

1661
01:39:51,970 --> 01:39:53,436
She gave him up.

1662
01:39:53,438 --> 01:39:57,741
She loves that boy. The
curse will still work.

1663
01:39:57,743 --> 01:39:59,743
But we'll need his friend.

1664
01:39:59,745 --> 01:40:01,344
Oh, my sugar darlin'?

1665
01:40:01,346 --> 01:40:04,414
He's ready to go whenever I call.

1666
01:40:04,416 --> 01:40:07,617
Can I do it again?

1667
01:40:07,619 --> 01:40:08,952
You can't tell anyone.

1668
01:40:08,954 --> 01:40:11,554
Promise me you won't tell a living soul?

1669
01:40:11,556 --> 01:40:14,090
I won't, I swear it.

1670
01:40:14,092 --> 01:40:16,893
Ahh. Okay, one last time.

1671
01:40:16,895 --> 01:40:19,262
Try it again.

1672
01:40:24,336 --> 01:40:26,069
That is so cool.

1673
01:40:26,071 --> 01:40:28,605
I'll let you know when to do it, sugar.

1674
01:40:28,607 --> 01:40:30,573
You'll hear me loud and clear.

1675
01:40:30,575 --> 01:40:33,510
Just like you always do.

1676
01:40:33,512 --> 01:40:34,944
You have no idea

1677
01:40:34,946 --> 01:40:37,313
how much I just love
you to death right now.

1678
01:41:03,541 --> 01:41:05,675
Ready? Fire!

1679
01:41:05,677 --> 01:41:07,377
Fire!

1680
01:41:17,454 --> 01:41:19,556
Awesome.

1681
01:41:30,869 --> 01:41:32,368
Come in.

1682
01:41:37,274 --> 01:41:40,510
Are you ready to get dressed?

1683
01:41:40,512 --> 01:41:43,046
It's real pretty.

1684
01:41:51,055 --> 01:41:53,957
You've done the right thing.

1685
01:41:53,959 --> 01:41:56,192
How will I know if it worked?

1686
01:41:56,194 --> 01:42:00,730
When the curse has been
paid, you'll feel it.

1687
01:42:00,732 --> 01:42:02,732
You'll know.

1688
01:42:02,734 --> 01:42:07,437
Oh, people are starting
to arrive, sweetheart.

1689
01:42:07,439 --> 01:42:09,339
It's time.

1690
01:42:11,008 --> 01:42:15,144
Mavis, you look very s-special.

1691
01:42:15,146 --> 01:42:20,149
Well it is a very special day!

1692
01:42:28,626 --> 01:42:30,727
- Mom?
- Hi, sugar.

1693
01:42:30,729 --> 01:42:32,295
Careful with that.

1694
01:42:32,297 --> 01:42:35,198
Just 'cause there's no bullet
doesn't mean it can't burn you.

1695
01:42:35,200 --> 01:42:37,367
You're both late. Take a rifle and load.

1696
01:42:37,369 --> 01:42:39,535
You two are going to greenbrier.

1697
01:42:41,438 --> 01:42:45,174
Um, hello, everyone. And, uh...

1698
01:42:45,176 --> 01:42:48,211
Oh, thank you for coming.

1699
01:42:48,213 --> 01:42:49,212
Um...

1700
01:42:49,214 --> 01:42:50,847
The moon will be out soon,

1701
01:42:50,849 --> 01:42:54,117
so we should, uh, we should start.

1702
01:42:56,421 --> 01:42:57,487
Um...

1703
01:42:58,489 --> 01:42:59,856
Excuse me.

1704
01:42:59,858 --> 01:43:03,326
As the ancients have foretold...

1705
01:43:03,328 --> 01:43:07,096
a natural will be claimed.

1706
01:43:07,098 --> 01:43:11,067
For it has been predetermined
by the five elements

1707
01:43:11,069 --> 01:43:13,703
that upon this night...

1708
01:43:13,705 --> 01:43:18,174
An old cycle shall end and
a new cycle shall begin,

1709
01:43:18,176 --> 01:43:21,010
wherein the powers of
light and dark will merge,

1710
01:43:21,012 --> 01:43:25,782
and that upon this child
who becomes a woman...

1711
01:43:25,784 --> 01:43:27,483
Lena Duchannes...

1712
01:43:27,485 --> 01:43:30,019
Her true nature

1713
01:43:30,021 --> 01:43:33,690
will reveal the true
nature of all power...

1714
01:43:33,692 --> 01:43:35,525
for the new cycle.

1715
01:43:35,527 --> 01:43:38,227

01:43:51,309 --> 01:43:52,342
Or shoot me.

1722
01:43:52,344 --> 01:43:54,477
I'm so goddamn itchy, I swear,

1723
01:43:54,479 --> 01:43:56,980
I'd just rather be a casualty.

1724
01:43:56,982 --> 01:43:58,181
This is so stupid.

1725
01:43:58,183 --> 01:43:59,615
I wish I was...

1726
01:43:59,617 --> 01:44:01,985
You want-- you want
to just kill each other?

1727
01:44:01,987 --> 01:44:03,820
Come over, watch a movie?

1728
01:44:03,822 --> 01:44:05,855
"aliens"? Blu-ray?

1729
01:44:05,857 --> 01:44:07,290
All right.

1730
01:44:07,292 --> 01:44:09,492
On the count of three.

1731
01:44:12,564 --> 01:44:13,796
Ready.

1732
01:44:15,066 --> 01:44:16,466
- One.
- One.

1733
01:44:16,468 --> 01:44:18,067
- Two.
- Two.

1734
01:44:18,069 --> 01:44:20,770
Three.

1735
01:44:22,407 --> 01:44:24,240
What's wrong?

1736
01:44:25,876 --> 01:44:27,243
I don't know.

1737
01:44:33,852 --> 01:44:35,385
Ethan?

1738
01:44:35,387 --> 01:44:37,020
Ethan?!

1739
01:44:37,022 --> 01:44:38,921
Ethan.

1740
01:44:38,923 --> 01:44:41,524
- Lena.
- No.

1741
01:44:56,640 --> 01:44:57,974
Cease fire!

1742
01:44:57,976 --> 01:45:00,243
Ethan!

1743
01:45:00,245 --> 01:45:01,644
Where is Ethan?

1744
01:45:01,646 --> 01:45:05,181
Greenbrier! Get the
hell outta here, girl!

1745
01:45:07,618 --> 01:45:09,685
Ethan!

1746
01:45:09,687 --> 01:45:12,555
No! Ethan, no, no!

1747
01:45:12,557 --> 01:45:14,057
No!

1748
01:45:14,059 --> 01:45:17,727
Lena-- Lena, I didn't
k-- Lena, I swear.

1749
01:45:17,729 --> 01:45:19,896
No, don't! Don't!

1750
01:45:19,898 --> 01:45:21,464
- Sorry.
- I'm sorry.

1751
01:45:21,466 --> 01:45:25,401
You can't trust them, cuz.

1752
01:45:25,403 --> 01:45:28,738
They'll turn on each
other for no reason at all.

1753
01:45:40,717 --> 01:45:42,718
Lena, I'm sorry.

1754
01:45:42,720 --> 01:45:43,786
I didn't mean it.

1755
01:45:43,788 --> 01:45:45,354
Okay?

1756
01:45:49,027 --> 01:45:50,426
Welcome to the family,

1757
01:45:50,428 --> 01:45:54,430
my darling, special girl.

1758
01:46:17,822 --> 01:46:20,790
Storm's coming, Mr. Lee. Should we stop?

1759
01:47:02,266 --> 01:47:05,835
Lena, stop!

1760
01:47:12,810 --> 01:47:14,677
Macon?

1761
01:47:16,113 --> 01:47:19,482
Stop this, please.

1762
01:47:19,484 --> 01:47:23,653
Macon. Macon, what have you done?

1763
01:47:23,655 --> 01:47:26,389
The curse...

1764
01:47:26,391 --> 01:47:28,457
had to be paid.

1765
01:47:28,459 --> 01:47:30,960
I don't understand.

1766
01:47:30,962 --> 01:47:35,031
Somebody you love has to die.

1767
01:47:35,033 --> 01:47:37,767
That was a sneaky trick, Macon.

1768
01:47:37,769 --> 01:47:39,368
No fair.

1769
01:47:40,504 --> 01:47:42,071
Macon?

1770
01:47:42,073 --> 01:47:45,841
I promised his mother.

1771
01:47:45,843 --> 01:47:48,211
I can't lose you!

1772
01:47:49,547 --> 01:47:51,881
It's all right. It's all right, Lena.

1773
01:47:51,883 --> 01:47:53,082
No.

1774
01:47:53,084 --> 01:47:57,853
Don't let them fool you.

1775
01:47:57,855 --> 01:48:00,890
Claim...

1776
01:48:00,892 --> 01:48:03,993
yourself.

1777
01:48:34,224 --> 01:48:36,325
Uh-oh.

1778
01:48:38,929 --> 01:48:40,396
What are you doing?

1779
01:48:40,398 --> 01:48:43,633
I think this is just
between you and me, mama.

1780
01:48:43,635 --> 01:48:45,334
Fine with me.

1781
01:48:45,336 --> 01:48:48,170
Ridley! Don't be afraid.

1782
01:48:48,172 --> 01:48:49,905
She's on our side.

1783
01:48:49,907 --> 01:48:52,608
She's our Lena. You listen to me.

1784
01:48:52,610 --> 01:48:55,311
You're my daughter. I
always wanted you with me.

1785
01:48:55,313 --> 01:48:56,646
They took you from me.

1786
01:48:56,648 --> 01:48:58,748
The moon appears, and it will claim you

1787
01:48:58,750 --> 01:49:01,017
as you are destined to be claimed!

1788
01:49:01,019 --> 01:49:02,318
Accept it, sweetheart.

1789
01:49:02,320 --> 01:49:04,754
There's nothing you can do!

1790
01:49:18,169 --> 01:49:19,935
No one can do that.

1791
01:49:19,937 --> 01:49:23,873
Let me go! She's more powerful than you.

1792
01:49:23,875 --> 01:49:26,509
Lena! Lena, listen to me.

1793
01:49:26,511 --> 01:49:27,943
It was her idea.

1794
01:49:27,945 --> 01:49:31,213
Okay, she told me you
were going dark anyway.

1795
01:49:31,215 --> 01:49:32,782
I would never hurt you.

1796
01:49:32,784 --> 01:49:35,785
You remember when I left,
so I wouldn't hurt you?

1797
01:49:35,787 --> 01:49:37,687
Lena?

1798
01:49:37,689 --> 01:49:39,722
Go.

1799
01:49:41,425 --> 01:49:43,559
Thanks, cuz.

1800
01:49:49,367 --> 01:49:53,069
You know, you're a lot more
like me than you care to admit.

1801
01:49:53,071 --> 01:49:54,704
Well, nobody's perfect.

1802
01:49:54,706 --> 01:49:57,573
Lena, you have great powers.

1803
01:49:57,575 --> 01:49:59,141
I can teach you how to use them.

1804
01:49:59,143 --> 01:50:00,576
I can teach you how to become

1805
01:50:00,578 --> 01:50:02,345
the most powerful dark
caster who ever lived.

1806
01:50:02,347 --> 01:50:04,213
Oh, that's so sweet of you, mama.

1807
01:50:04,215 --> 01:50:05,848
Oh, baby.

1808
01:50:05,850 --> 01:50:09,418
This mortal you think you
love? You can never be together.

1809
01:50:09,420 --> 01:50:13,155
I know. Did you ever love me, mama?

1810
01:50:17,295 --> 01:50:19,729
You know, I don't remember.

1811
01:50:19,731 --> 01:50:21,597
No mother does, really.

1812
01:50:21,599 --> 01:50:23,499
It's not easy, you know,

1813
01:50:23,501 --> 01:50:25,401
pushing another female out of your body,

1814
01:50:25,403 --> 01:50:27,537
a younger, more perfect
version of yourself,

1815
01:50:27,539 --> 01:50:29,872
with every option and no mistakes.

1816
01:50:31,009 --> 01:50:32,976
Anyhow, love is just a
trick of the mind, you know?

1817
01:50:33,178 --> 01:50:36,146
It doesn't really exist.
There's no such thing in nature.

1818
01:50:37,748 --> 01:50:41,350
Love's a spell, created by
mortals to give their females

1819
01:50:41,351 --> 01:50:44,553
something to play with instead of power.

1820
01:50:44,555 --> 01:50:47,356
I want you to have power.

1821
01:50:47,358 --> 01:50:50,326
I want you to be who you truly are.

1822
01:50:50,328 --> 01:50:52,661
As long as I'm just like you.

1823
01:50:52,663 --> 01:50:55,731
There's darkness in you.
Don't you try and deny it.

1824
01:50:55,733 --> 01:50:57,233
I don't.

1825
01:50:57,235 --> 01:50:58,701
Well, then claim it.

1826
01:50:58,703 --> 01:51:00,836
Claim it and come with me, be with me.

1827
01:51:00,838 --> 01:51:02,838
We can rule over a new world,

1828
01:51:02,840 --> 01:51:04,507
our world.

1829
01:51:10,448 --> 01:51:13,082
What are you doing?

1830
01:51:13,084 --> 01:51:15,050
It is a new world, mama.

1831
01:51:15,052 --> 01:51:18,687
But it ain't all dark,
and it ain't all light.

1832
01:51:18,689 --> 01:51:20,990
And it ain't all ours.

1833
01:51:25,195 --> 01:51:27,163
I remember now.

1834
01:51:27,165 --> 01:51:29,498
I remember now. I did
love you. I do love you.

1835
01:51:29,500 --> 01:51:31,667
I did love you. I love
you, darlin'. I love you!

1836
01:51:31,669 --> 01:51:35,137
You really shouldn't use
words you don't understand.

1837
01:51:37,175 --> 01:51:40,676
You still need me!

1838
01:51:40,678 --> 01:51:42,611
You've done enough, mama.

1839
01:51:44,714 --> 01:51:49,552
You must be claimed!

1840
01:52:21,952 --> 01:52:23,519
Macon?

1841
01:52:28,124 --> 01:52:31,160
You all right, cuz?

1842
01:52:31,162 --> 01:52:33,028
Yeah.

1843
01:52:37,334 --> 01:52:42,571
Macon said this was the
only way to protect you both.

1844
01:52:52,850 --> 01:52:55,684
<i>I could hear the sound.</i>

1845
01:52:55,686 --> 01:52:58,587
<i>The sound was me breaking.</i>

1846
01:52:58,589 --> 01:53:01,724
<i>I cried because he had lived.</i>

1847
01:53:01,726 --> 01:53:04,593
<i>Because he had died.</i>

1848
01:53:04,595 --> 01:53:08,330
<i>I was shattered, I was saved.</i>

1849
01:53:08,332 --> 01:53:12,701
<i>I only knew the girl I was, was gone.</i>

1850
01:53:12,703 --> 01:53:14,637
<i>He was right.</i>

1851
01:53:14,639 --> 01:53:18,641
<i>No good can come from loving a mortal.</i>

1852
01:53:18,643 --> 01:53:21,977
<i>They can't survive our world.</i>

1853
01:53:23,680 --> 01:53:25,915
<i>Get out. Go, Ethan.</i>

1854
01:53:25,917 --> 01:53:31,921
<i>Claim yourself in defiance, in hope...</i>

1855
01:53:31,923 --> 01:53:34,957
<i>in love, in fury, in gratitude.</i>

1856
01:53:34,959 --> 01:53:38,594
<i>Claim the light. Claim the dark.</i>

1857
01:53:38,596 --> 01:53:40,429
<i>Claim it all.</i>

1858
01:53:40,431 --> 01:53:43,599
<i>Nothing can stay.</i>

1859
01:53:49,272 --> 01:53:52,207
- You all set?
- Yeah.

1860
01:53:52,209 --> 01:53:54,476
We should be in New York by
Thursday if we make good time.

1861
01:53:54,478 --> 01:53:56,946
We're gonna go stay with
Link's cousin in Brooklyn.

1862
01:53:56,948 --> 01:53:58,681
Come here.

1863
01:53:58,683 --> 01:54:00,783
I'll call you as soon as I get in.

1864
01:54:00,785 --> 01:54:03,819
You call whenever you can.

1865
01:54:03,821 --> 01:54:05,721
Bye.

1866
01:54:10,660 --> 01:54:12,494
Hi. Um...

1867
01:54:12,496 --> 01:54:13,963
Lena, right?

1868
01:54:13,965 --> 01:54:15,965
- Hi. Yeah.
- Ethan Wate.

1869
01:54:15,967 --> 01:54:17,333
Yeah, I know.

1870
01:54:19,437 --> 01:54:23,572
Um, so, I wanted,
I-- you know...

1871
01:54:23,574 --> 01:54:28,577
Um, I'm sorry that we never got to hang,

1872
01:54:28,579 --> 01:54:30,746
but I always wanted to tell you

1873
01:54:30,748 --> 01:54:32,848
I thought your-- your, uh, poems

1874
01:54:32,850 --> 01:54:35,217
In creative writing...

1875
01:54:35,219 --> 01:54:37,152
Just really good.

1876
01:54:37,154 --> 01:54:39,154
Thanks.

1877
01:54:39,156 --> 01:54:41,724
That's really nice of you to say.

1878
01:54:43,326 --> 01:54:45,794
You're leaving?

1879
01:54:45,796 --> 01:54:48,330
Yeah. Uh, college road trip.

1880
01:54:49,800 --> 01:54:52,334
I'm going to check out NYU.

1881
01:54:52,336 --> 01:54:54,970
Great. It's good.

1882
01:55:00,276 --> 01:55:02,578
Oh, cool title.

1883
01:55:02,580 --> 01:55:05,514
Bukowski?

1884
01:55:05,516 --> 01:55:06,982
He any good?

1885
01:55:08,385 --> 01:55:10,819
Define "good."

1886
01:55:17,560 --> 01:55:19,228
Keep it.

1887
01:55:19,230 --> 01:55:22,031

1888
01:55:23,333 --> 01:55:25,234

01:55:25,236 --> 01:55:26,568
Thank you.

See you.

1894
01:55:44,320 --> 01:55:46,889
