1
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,436
(Dogs barking)

2
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,476
(Hollow banging)

3
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,152
(Tyres screech)

4
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,036
(Dogs barking)

5
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,470
(Men talking, indistinct)

6
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,676
(Man) Go and get the dogs.

7
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,109
(Man) Oome on, then. Mews!

8
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,596
Oome on, now. Open your mouth.
Open your mouth, eh?

9
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,399
Learn to appreciate your food, eh?

10
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:32,759
Oompared to what you serve up
in that dirty little canteen of yours,

11
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:36,196
- this is a three-star supper.
- (Gasping)

12
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,152
You must learn the rules.

13
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,949
I need to eat and drink the very best
and that's expensive.

14
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,713
Have you ever heard of
chicken â la reine Marie

15
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,836
or oyster sauce mornay

16
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,309
or frogs' legs Parisienne?

17
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,356
No. Oourse you haven't.

18
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,398
Take his pants down! Take his pants down.

19
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,836
(Dogs whimpering)

20
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,956
(Men shouting)

21
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,999
(Man) Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.

22
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,470
Didn't your daddy teach you
to wipe your bottom? Eh?

23
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,596
(Woman) Albert! Leave him alone.

24
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,399
- Oome on, let's eat.
- Oh, let's eat.

25
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:20,031
Before we eat, Georgina,
we must feed and water the animals.

26
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:24,395
Roy! This is my wife, Georgina Spica.

27
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,869
She's got a heart of gold and a body to match.

28
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:31,511
I am Albert Spica and I have a heart of gold
and a great deal of money to match.

29
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:36,879
And you are Roy, who's got absolutely nothing,
except what you owe me.

30
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:42,478
You are humiliated in front of a lady,
you're humiliated in front of us.

31
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,348
Georgina, I'll be as quick as I possibly can.

32
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:50,831
Gah... You, go and get me some hot water, eh?
And a towel and soap.

33
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,036
Now...

34
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,634
Yeah. (Laughs)

35
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:59,395
Now I've given you a good dinner
and you can have a nice drink.

36
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,631
Now, you behave yourself in future
and pay when I ask you.

37
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,712
- No, no, no...
- Or next time I'll make you eat your own shit

38
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,792
after forcing it through your dick like toothpaste.

39
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:13,670
No, put that away, Spangler.
Oor blimey, there's a lady present.

40
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,389
She doesn't want to see
your shrivelled contributions.

41
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,357
Ah.

42
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,477
That's it. Thank you very much. Nice, clean...

43
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,915
Give me that towel!

44
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,150
Give me that. Yeah.

45
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:32,519
I never liked that Ohinese food
but looking at you now, I like it even less.

46
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,909
(Laughing) Righto, boys!

47
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,276
We must surprise Richard on our anniversary.

48
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,430
Bring the letters.

49
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,916
Georgie, you got ash on your tits.
If you're gonna wear black, don't smoke.

50
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,356
- You look like a tart in black.
- (Georgina) It's blue.

51
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,955
It's black, and don't smoke. It's sloppy in a woman.

52
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,190
No one who's going to eat smokes.

53
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,239
It ruins your taste buds, burns your tongue
and makes your pee stink.

54
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,629
- Rubbish.
- It's not bloody rubbish.

55
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,951
I've smelt the loo
after you've been piddling in there.

56
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,873
When are you gonna learn, smartarse?

57
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:17,238
(Boy soprano) # Have mercy upon me #

58
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,995
(Albert) Oome on, hurry up, boys.

59
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:24,231
#... upon me #

60
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,476
Righto, lads, get them numbers up there -
Spica & Boarst.

61
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:40,154
# Blot out my transgressions

62
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:47,994
# Purge me with hyssop

63
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:54,431
# And I shall be clean

64
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:59,596
# Wash me

65
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,116
# Wash me

66
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:09,594
# And I shall be whiter than snow #

67
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,836
(Albert) Where's Richard?

68
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:17,196
- He's plucking.
- He's plucking, eh? Richard!

69
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,078
Where are you?
Stop that plucking. Where are you?

70
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,913
Now what's that? A-S-P...

71
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,391
That's nonsense. Spell it right, for Ohrist's sake.

72
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:30,995
Bloody hell. Richard! Rich... Ah!

73
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,674
There you are, Richard. Now...

74
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,832
Leave that out and come and see
what I've got you, eh?

75
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:40,390
I've brought you a present.
This is our anniversary.

76
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,950
Three months of mutual understanding,
eh, Richard?

77
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:49,319
Three months since I first invited you
to be my favourite restaurateur.

78
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,790
(French accent) Mr Spica, this is a duck.

79
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,235
Ducks are born with the feathers on

80
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,834
but it's your dinner, Mr Spica.

81
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:02,948
If you want the feathers to remain,
we could try the dish,

82
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,919
I suppose, by leaving the feathers as they are.

83
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,070
Oanard en ses plumes torche.

84
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,875
Mitchel, you mule.

85
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,349
'Ere, Richard, come and see, come on.

86
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,512
Please, I beg you. Ha! Oome on.

87
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:24,758
Georgina, how many times have I told you?
No smoking in the kitchen.

88
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:29,516
- Mitchel, get your arse down here quick. Oome on.
- (Oook shouting)

89
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:34,799
Now, Richard, this is your... well, our new sign.

90
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,075
# Da-da-da-da-da-da! #

91
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,720
- Wallop!
- (Oheering and applause)

92
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,916
(Albert) Oh, God!

93
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,191
Richard.

94
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,517
- It's dark in the restaurant.
- Yes, Phillipe.

95
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:59,878
Thanks to Mr Spica's generosity,
it is dark everywhere.

96
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,795
No power, no light.

97
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:11,908
- Were you thinking of a cold buffet tonight?
- (Albert) But I don't want a cold buffet.

98
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,711
- Paté d'alouettes with a chicory sauce.
- Paté d'alouettes with a chicory sauce.

99
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,509
- Terrine de caneton.
- Terrine de canton.

100
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:28,277
- Oold turkey with lemon and basilica.
- Oold turkey with the lemon and basilica.

101
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,316
Anchovies in garlic vinegar.

102
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,234
It doesn't have to be cold,
you've got gas, for God's sake!

103
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,595
(Wolf whistle)

104
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:40,275
(Mews) Got an arse on her
like two greased watermelons in a sack.

105
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:43,432
(Richard) Oold chicken, paté d'alouettes,

106
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:47,149
salade de langoustine,
gâteau de carottes et Gruyére...

107
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:52,109
You. You put them electrics right, Mitchel.
Put them electrics right or...

108
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,156
(Richard) You don't eat.

109
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,196
You don't eat.

110
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,520
I told you not to smoke.

111
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,912
I should stand still, Mr Spica. Or who knows?

112
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,356
You might spoil something,
put your foot in something.

113
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:14,195
So, a hot meal for tonight.
Something special, please. How about some...

114
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:18,319
some, er, les oh d'oeuvres, er, gâteau au poivres,

115
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:23,235
er, terrine et fillet lamb et poison au er, poi, poi...

116
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,710
- It's "poisson".
- What did you say, Georgie?

117
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,075
What did you say? What did you say?

118
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,036
Poisson.

119
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,076
(Oheering)

120
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,116
(Whistling)

121
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:42,155
- Well, Mr Spica, I hope you are hungry.
- Always. Get in there, boys.

122
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:50,715
Go on, Georgie, go in there,
raise your skirts and warm my seat. (Laughs)

123
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,437
Eh, what do you think then, eh? What do you...?

124
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,356
(Orockery smashes)

125
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,629
If you spent as much money
on the meal, Mr Spica,

126
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,518
as you waste on the decor,

127
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,037
your taste in good food must surely improve.

128
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,553
(Dogs barking)

129
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,997
(Albert) You'll cheek me once too often, Boarst.
You rely on me, don't forget.

130
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:25,073
Without me, you, a foreigner,
you wouldn't last long around here.

131
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,549
Look out there, see what I've brought you.

132
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:31,269
Two vans full of good stuff,
just right for your kitchen.

133
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,591
- (Richard) I would not touch it.
- (Albert) Why on earth not?

134
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:38,798
I insist on buying my own food, Mr Spica.

135
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,917
Then I can be sure of its quality.

136
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,515
I represent quality round here,
my name is known for it.

137
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,070
I offer quality and protection.

138
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:53,597
Protection against what,
I wonder, Mr Spica? And whom?

139
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:58,117
Protection, Boarst,
against the rash temper of my men.

140
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:03,074
Against a sudden arrival of food poisoning.

141
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,958
Against rats. Against the public health inspector.

142
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:12,397
(Richard) If you are hungry tonight,
you are going to have to wait.

143
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,439
Do up the third button
of your expensive jacket, Mr Spica.

144
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:23,116
You'll feel less empty inside, Mr Spica.

145
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,430
You can't make me wait.

146
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:29,752
(Boy soprano) # Deliver me

147
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:37,155
# From blood-guiltiness

148
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,677
# O God

149
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:46,834
# My tongue shall sing aloud

150
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,957
# Of Thy righteousness

151
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:57,998
# Have mercy upon me

152
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:06,679
# Blot out my transgressions

153
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:17,835
# O Lord, open Thou my lips

154
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,198
# And my mouth

155
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:31,631
# Shall show forth Thy praise

156
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,273
# And my mouth

157
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:43,392
# Shall show forth Thy praise

158
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,674
# And my mouth

159
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:54,713
# Shall show forth Thy praise

160
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,920
# And my mouth

161
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:05,634
# Shall show forth Thy praise #

162
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,638
No, you don't eat it like that! Let me show you.

163
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,793
Oh. Imagine you are sucking
the little fingers of a lady or...

164
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:46,273
No, you'd never get that close to a lady.
Who'd wanna get that close to you?

165
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:50,558
- I wouldn't be interested in her fingers.
- I'd expect you to say that.

166
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:54,679
You'd just whip it in, whip it out
and wipe it on yourjacket.

167
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,593
Look at yourjacket, it's like a pig field.

168
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,717
And your nails could do with a clean. Show me.

169
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:06,270
Gawd. Why can't I have some bloody quality
in my associates?

170
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:10,592
From now on, anyone not properly dressed
for dinner will pay for it.

171
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:14,355
I'll write lessons down for you.
Georgina can type them out.

172
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:20,074
"Notes For Gourmets". That's French
for a good eater, isn't it, Boarst? (Belches)

173
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,199
- Gourmets don't belch.
- On the contrary, on the contrary. They do.

174
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,192
It shows that you are enjoying a meal.

175
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:31,239
Not with your fingers, Spangler!
That's all you understand -

176
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,756
things you eat with your hands
whilst walking down the street.

177
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,798
You told Mews to eat the celery with his fingers.

178
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:42,032
That's different, you dope.
And it's asparagus, not celery.

179
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:47,877
What's the point of sinking thousands
into a restaurant if you refuse to eat properly?

180
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:51,635
- Tell him, Georgina.
- Tell him what?

181
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:56,271
Just copy Georgina. She knows how to do it.
Oory, get Richard in here.

182
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:00,797
I want my sign fixed up
and put on that wall over the kitchen door.

183
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:05,237
If Richard was more interested in slogans,
he'd make more money, eh?

184
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,350
- This place is too dark.
- (Belches)

185
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:12,115
Oould do with a respray. Gold, it needs more gold.

186
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,589
How about gold and blue?

187
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:19,598
What do you think, Henry?
10,000 should do it - two months' takings.

188
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,355
You should get in there.
Boarst's prices are all over the place.

189
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:28,478
His head's in the clouds. Good cook. Brilliant cook!

190
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:33,156
Except he puts mushrooms on everything.
Henry, put that cigarette out.

191
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,312
Do you mind if I eat whilst you smoke?

192
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:40,632
Gordon choked on a cigarette whilst eating -
burnt his epiglottis.

193
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,554
Mitchel, you've got one.
And you don't keep it in your trousers.

194
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:51,279
You don't put orange rind on the edge
of your plate, it goes there, you dolt!

195
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:56,718
What you've got to realise is that
a clever cook puts unlikely things together

196
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,270
like duck and orange, like pineapple and ham.

197
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,316
It's called artistry.

198
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:06,473
I'm an artist, the way I combine
my business and my pleasure.

199
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,869
Money's my business, eating's my pleasure.

200
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:13,112
And Georgie's my pleasure too,
though in a more private kind of way

201
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,875
than stuffing the mouth and feeding the sewers.

202
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,996
Though the pleasures are related,

203
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:24,518
because the naughty bits and the dirty bits
are so close together

204
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,797
that itjust goes to show
how eating and sex are related.

205
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:33,759
Georgie's naughty bits
are nicely related, aren't they?

206
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,832
Especially when she's
paying me attention. Georgie.

207
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,478
(Gasps)

208
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:43,680
(Albert) Get Phillipe! In future, I want my napkins
folded at home, Georgina. Get Adele to teach you.

209
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,629
Spangler, get up and get Phillipe.

210
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:51,554
Bring Richard here,
I've got to make him a proposition.

211
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:55,269
Get Adele to get that water
with the angostura bitters in it

212
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,592
and some lemon in the water
and a bowl of ice water for me fingers...

213
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:04,231
Henry! Give me those glasses off that table.
And the flowers.

214
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:08,112
This should look the most important table here.

215
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:11,510
I like a load of glasses around, it highers the tone.

216
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:30,072
- What's that?
- For Madame Spica, compliments of the house.

217
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,118
She's no Madame. Why haven't I got one?

218
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,113
- I doubt, Mr Spica, if you'll like it.
- Try me.

219
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:42,319
We have grown accustomed
to you being a conservative eater.

220
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,676
That's not true. I'm as adventurous as the next.

221
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,752
Your wife has an excellent palate, Mr Spica.

222
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,752
It is always a pleasure for us to serve her.

223
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:37,509
(Albert) I want one of those hot, damp towels,
Richard, served to me with tongs.

224
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:43,429
Adele is no good with cash and figures.
She's just decorative, all lips and tits.

225
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,398
- We'll replace her.
- (Mitchel) Oan I do the replacing?

226
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:52,237
Stuff your mouth, Mitchel. Every time you open it,
you just show how vulgar you can be.

227
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,874
(Albert) Georgina! Welcome back.

228
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,555
Did you wipe the seat
before you parked your bum? (Laughs)

229
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:36,475
You never know what you can catch these days.
Every toilet seat is a minefield.

230
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:42,669
That's for you. Richard thought I might like
to taste it, personal compliments of the chef.

231
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:46,036
Eat it. I didn't fancy it, it smelt off.

232
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,878
Iris got a canker on her bum
from sitting on a loo seat.

233
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:55,478
The mechanic across the road poured
battery acid down the WO to clear it.

234
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:00,708
Some of it splashed on the seat.
Iris ran screaming into the street,

235
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,791
her backside hissing.

236
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,757
She hasn't been the same since.

237
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:09,709
She strips the same
but never with her back to the audience.

238
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:13,952
She had to change her act.
Now it's more full-frontal.

239
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:17,112
- Where are you going?
- I left my lighter in the toilet.

240
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,839
- Gawd's sake. You don't need it.
- I need it.

241
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:24,948
Richard, I'm going to ban smoking in here.
Tomorrow, the signs are going up.

242
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:28,271
You want to thicken your French accent
up a bit, mate,

243
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,749
like you've just come over from Paris.

244
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:35,277
Give them a bit of that ooh-la-la stuff.
Bit more of that "parlez-vous français?"

245
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,272
Then you would not understand me, Mr Spica.

246
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:42,433
I don't know. I've always been able
to understand French letters.

247
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,476
(Laughter)

248
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,549
(Door opens)

249
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,716
(Water running)

250
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,312
(Door opens)

251
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,231
Georgina!

252
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,788
What the hell are you doing in here?

253
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,520
Georgina?

254
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,639
You've been in here for ages.
What are you doing, having a baby?

255
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,995
I'm, er, I'm just...

256
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,553
- I'm just having a quiet smoke.
- Smoke?

257
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,830
You know how you hate me smoking at the table.

258
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,309
Gawd's sake, Georgina.

259
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,233
Why tell me lies about a lost lighter?

260
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:47,996
(Georgina) I didn't, I left it here
on the ledge in front of the mirror.

261
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,195
I'll be out in a few moments.

262
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:56,831
Don't hang around the ladies,
you'll embarrass the customers.

263
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,876
Show me the lighter.

264
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,394
(Georgina) There.

265
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,676
Do you want a cigarette as well?

266
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,069
Don't be so bloody stupid.

267
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:12,233
What are you doing in there,
Georgina, eh? (Laughs)

268
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,356
You playing with yourself?

269
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:18,956
That's not allowed, that's my property.
You're not allowed to fiddle with it.

270
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:24,114
- Shut up, Albert.
- Let me in, I'll show you how to wipe yourself.

271
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,515
Go away. I'll be out in a minute.

272
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,433
Well, don't be long.

273
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:34,513
I'll order you some gâteau aux poivres.

274
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,555
Some profiteroles.

275
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,516
And wash your hands.

276
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:47,438
You don't know the women who use this place.

277
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,200
- (Door closes)
- (Sighs)

278
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,229
(Toilet flushes)

279
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,276
(Sighs quietly)

280
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,876
You took your time.

281
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,360
I thought you'd like me to wait for you.

282
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,150
You smell nice and sweaty.

283
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,674
Wash your hands, I'll give you a kiss.

284
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,956
(Water running)

285
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:24,318
You know what they say about men
who hang around ladies' lavatories?

286
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:31,439
What do they say about men
who hang around ladies' lavatories?

287
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:35,559
- They're asking to have their illusions shattered.
- Yeah.

288
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,791
You hold no illusions for me, Georgie, eh?

289
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,155
No stone's been left unturned.

290
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:44,596
Look, just go order my profiteroles, will you?

291
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,830
Oome on.

292
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,996
Oome on.

293
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,636
(Laughter)

294
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,156
I think these Ethiopians like starving.

295
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:42,475
It keeps them slim and graceful, with those
big heads and dreamy eyes. You know those kids.

296
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:46,917
- (Georgina) You're sick.
- (Albert) I might well be if you're being so priggish.

297
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:52,597
(Woman) What do you know, Georgina, about
the starving? You can have anything you want.

298
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:57,800
- Where you been? You're late.
- It's Friday night. There's a lot of money about.

299
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:03,631
A decent man needs gloves to touch this stuff.
Let's have a look.

300
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:06,518
That's just what this restaurant needs.

301
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,194
- Start laying them out.
- (Belches)

302
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:12,590
What's the matter, Mitchel?
Don't you like mussels?

303
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:15,911
You got to learn to like them
if you're going to eat with me.

304
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,468
Don't you dare throw up in here!

305
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:21,916
Or I'll get Spangler to stuff 'em
back down your throat.

306
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,711
(Oory) From the Malay restaurant.
The food poisoning scared them, they're paying up.

307
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,758
I'm sure they don't need our assistance with that.

308
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:34,116
That stuff they eat,
they'd poison themselves with it.

309
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:38,398
Some of them Indians are well known
for drinking their own pee.

310
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:42,075
The same water would go round and round.

311
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:46,790
Of course, you're bound to lose some
through evaporation.

312
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:51,078
Then you'd have to top it up.
Whose pee would you drink first?

313
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:54,232
- Erm...
- Me, I'd have a ready supply, wouldn't I?

314
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,835
Georgie and I have our little sessions when we...

315
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:00,115
Good God, what have you got there?

316
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:04,557
Even you are getting compliments
from the chef, are you?

317
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:08,110
Being a guinea pig
for a Boarst experiment, are we?

318
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:14,469
Good God, looks like, er,
food for constipated French rabbits.

319
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:19,156
Albert, why don't you order me some chianti?
You know I like chianti.

320
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,754
In the bottle with the wrapping around it.

321
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,912
Then I can take it home and hang it on the wall.

322
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,834
- Grace, haven't you got enough of them already?
- No.

323
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,956
Where the hell are you going?

324
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:34,510
- To the toilet.
- You haven't had anything to drink yet.

325
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:38,559
She's got a bladder like a leaky marrow.
Don't be long!

326
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,677
- You've upset her.
- Rubbish.

327
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:47,710
Don't be long! You're so talkative tonight,
we couldn't stand the silence without you.

328
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,956
Wash your hands!

329
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,914
- Questo, questo.
- Oazzo.

330
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,753
Dove hai imparato a cucinare? È velenoso.

331
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,990
Vieni qua.

332
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,396
That's off!

333
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,436
Uh.

334
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:58,308
- This custard's salty.
- It is sauce Hollandaise.

335
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,356
Oan I help you, Mr Spica?

336
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:03,830
I've come about
those special complimentary dishes.

337
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:07,515
In future, all the guests at my table
shall receive them.

338
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,034
Why is my fish taking so long?

339
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:13,317
You can carry it in yourself, if you like, Mr Spica.

340
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,190
- What are you looking for?
- Nothing. You bring it.

341
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:22,956
- (Richard) You would not be looking for your wife?
- No, of course not.

342
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,998
Mr Spica, I have something to show you.

343
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:43,475
- What is this?
- New cutlery. Give your restaurant some style.

344
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:47,951
I brought in 300 sets.
My men are just re-laying the tables.

345
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:52,915
Not very good quality, Mr Spica.

346
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:58,238
You could use them at home, Mr Spica.

347
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,959
All 300 of them.

348
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,714
Where have you been? Wiping your bum?

349
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,110
Did you use your left hand like I showed you?

350
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:45,875
Where'd you get this stuff, Mews?
It's rubbish, falling apart.

351
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:50,590
Take 'em back. Get a 150%% refund. God.

352
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:56,477
What are you eating, Georgie? Not much.

353
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:01,111
Ha! I see others here
get the same special attentions.

354
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:06,149
What is it? Looks like
some sort of... watery salade.

355
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,435
That's not up to much.

356
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:11,512
Expensive, no doubt, but not fattening.

357
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:14,876
You've got to keep your strength up,
you're looking peaky.

358
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,952
Kidneys, liver, iron, that's what you need.

359
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:23,956
Do you know a cow drinks
its own weight in water twice a week?

360
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:28,556
For milk, you see,
because a cow's got great big tits.

361
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,915
Just like you, eh, Georgie?

362
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:38,159
You gentlemen will have to take it
for granted because

363
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:41,630
for some reason best known to herself,

364
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,790
she's left her bra off.

365
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,800
Have you, Oory, ever tasted human milk?

366
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:53,275
I mean recently. All them years ago don't count.

367
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:57,911
You couldn't really appreciate
what you were enjoying then, could you?

368
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:03,711
I bet human milk's a great delicacy
in some countries. It ought to be here.

369
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:08,149
Do you know, Oory, who could supply us
with some human milk?

370
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:12,358
(Spangler) Warm, straight from the receptacle,
so to speak?

371
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:16,353
Don'tjoke! It's a precious commodity,
not a joking matter!

372
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:19,079
Georgie wouldn'tjoke about it, would you?

373
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:21,151
Would you, Georgie?

374
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:26,519
Ah. You're a credit to women. You could show
these young women a thing or two.

375
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:30,354
You could teach these young men
a thing or two. Take Mitchel.

376
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:33,989
On second thoughts, don't,
cos he's a crude little bugger.

377
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:37,709
- Then how come you haven't got any kids?
- Kids?

378
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,990
Who needs kids? Who wants kids?

379
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,954
I want kids.

380
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:51,793
We'll have kids one day, won't we, eh?

381
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,711
When you're bloody old and grey, most like!

382
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:01,315
Yeah. Your trouble is you don't eat properly.

383
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:06,193
You should drink more water and eat more kidneys

384
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:10,159
and then you might bloody well have
a bloody baby someday.

385
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:14,279
Georgie doesn't like babies, do you?

386
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:19,354
You know, sometimes, Georgie,
I think you behave like a bloke.

387
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,396
What days are those, then, Albert?

388
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,436
- What's it like?
- You what?

389
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:28,071
Get away from this table, you mucky little wimp!

390
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:32,995
Go and eat your vegetable soup in the kitchen,
you dirty little pervert!

391
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:36,072
Go on, get on with your eating, eh?

392
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:39,232
It's only Mitchel making a fool of himself.

393
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:42,198
Now, stand in the corner.
Oory, make him a paper hat.

394
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:45,317
Stand in the corner like a naughty little boy.

395
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:48,597
Stand there. Take your knife and fork with you.

396
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:51,353
- Don't be stupid.
- Do you want to join him?

397
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:58,118
Leave him alone. He's only copying you
like he always does. You behave, he'll behave.

398
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,953
- I'm leaving.
- Yes, we are leaving.

399
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:05,830
Gracie, here. Pay the bill and take a taxi.

400
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:10,799
Yeah. Georgie and I might go for a little drive.

401
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:15,552
It's our wedding anniversary tomorrow.

402
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:18,200
Might drive down to the sea,

403
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:21,078
have some fun under the pier like we used to.

404
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:33,873
Oops. I am sorry.

405
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:37,669
Still, this isn't a library, it's a restaurant.

406
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,716
They got people for that.

407
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,996
Richard.

408
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:49,232
This needs cooking.
Grill it with some mashed peas.

409
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,150
(Mutters in French)

410
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:03,638
(Boy soprano) # Wash me thoroughly

411
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:07,474
# From my iniquity

412
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:12,759
# And cleanse me... #

413
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:15,752
What's a young lad like you doing
washing dishes?

414
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:18,877
That's woman's work,
ain't you got what it takes? Hey!

415
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:23,317
My God, armour plating.
You protect yourself, son, you need it.

416
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:26,437
Innocence. That's what I had before I met Georgie.

417
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:29,796
- That's just what they want.
- Albert. Oome on, you're drunk.

418
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,950
- Oome on!
- Shall I sing for you?

419
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:34,952
- What?
- Albert, come on, he's only a child.

420
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:38,555
Sing for me, yes. Yes, you can sing for me.

421
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,995
Get up there. You sing, yeah.

422
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:45,631
I was a good singer when I was a little boy,
wasn't I, Georgie?

423
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:48,632
Oome on, now. You sing to me. Eh?

424
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,630
Oome on. Sing, damn you!

425
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:57,319
# Wash me thoroughly

426
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:00,949
- # From my iniquity
- (Albert laughs)

427
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:05,079
- # And cleanse... #
- You can't keep it up, can you? No.

428
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:07,390
I was a choirboy once.

429
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:10,438
Yes. Women like choirboys.

430
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:14,035
I was almost a choirboy when I met Georgie.

431
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:16,793
But you spoilt all that, didn't you?

432
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:21,158
Georgie was a very good education,
she could teach a young man anything.

433
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:25,472
Oome on, Georgie, show the young boy
what you showed me.

434
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:28,233
- Albert.
- Go on, show the little boy...

435
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:31,437
- Albert!
- You do what I tell you, will you?

436
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:35,836
You come out in that car park with me,
both of you. Oome on.

437
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,878
Out in the car park. Oome on.

438
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:47,631
I'll give you the best education,
show you what a great teacher Georgie can be.

439
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,790
- (Boy whimpering)
- Don't touch him!

440
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:53,953
(Georgina) Leave him alone.
(Albert) I'll show you what a great teacher...

441
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:58,909
Oh, I see. So I'm not supposed to do that?
I'll give you an education.

442
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,434
- Albert, please leave him alone.
- Oh, no.

443
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,193
- Stand there and don't you move.
- (Dogs barking)

444
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,236
- Just leave him be.
- Watch this.

445
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:10,552
- No. Wait till we get home, Albert.
- Georgie. Georgie, come here.

446
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:14,997
Right. What's all this?
You're not wearing any bloody knickers.

447
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:18,470
You've been sitting in that restaurant
with no knickers on?

448
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:22,553
With Oory and Mitchel and all those people?
What's this mean?

449
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,915
Where are they? Give them to me at once.

450
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,152
Go on. Look at this.
Get in that car, you dirty whore.

451
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:32,835
Why don't you take everything off?

452
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:37,232
- Get in there. Go on! Get in that car!
- (Georgina gasping)

453
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:40,915
- Now you! You get in there as well.
- No!

454
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,629
- Go on. Get in there. Get in.
- No! Please!

455
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:48,875
- No! No! No!
- Get in there! Get in.

456
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,996
Aah! Ah!

457
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,914
- (Albert) Right...
- (Glass smashes)

458
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,116
(Georgina screaming) No!

459
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:10,073
# Wash me thoroughly

460
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:13,869
# From my iniquity

461
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:22,958
# And cleanse me from my sins

462
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:31,159
# Have mercy upon me... #

463
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,510
I have two minutes.

464
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:06,988
# Purge me with hyssop

465
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,516
# And I shall be

466
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,756
# Olean

467
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:19,516
# Wash me

468
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:23,115
# Wash me

469
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:30,550
# And I shall be whiter than snow

470
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:36,029
# Make me to hear

471
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:44,710
- # Thy joy and gladness #
- (Glasses reverberate)

472
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:47,234
# That the bones

473
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:55,955
# That Thou hast broken may rejoice #

474
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:57,231
Do you know, Mitchel, what prairie oysters are?

475
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:00,196
Fish.

476
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:04,592
So if someone feeds you a prairie oyster,
what would you be eating?

477
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:08,593
Fish. Like from the lakes and that. They're the...

478
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:11,114
The clams with the little pearls in.

479
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,549
Prairie oysters would be very precious
to their owners. No.

480
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:17,596
No, look. Imagine...

481
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:21,673
Just imagine that this is a prairie oyster.

482
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:25,753
Now, go on. Eat that. Go on.
Put it in your mouth. Go on. Go on.

483
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:28,400
Now, what's it taste like?

484
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:32,676
- Wet bread.
- No.

485
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:35,558
It's all squishy with gritty bits in it.

486
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:39,435
That's the sand.

487
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:44,158
That's the sand. You're a comic.

488
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:47,755
No, you mule. It's got a skin round it.

489
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:52,910
- Do you spit the skin out?
- No.

490
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,072
Pick it out of your teeth afterwards, chump it up.

491
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:59,197
Now, swallow that, go on, swallow it. Swallow it.

492
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,236
Go on, that's right.

493
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:05,393
Now, Mitchel, you have just eaten
a sheep's bollock.

494
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:13,991
The next time I ask you to work for me, Mitchel,

495
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:17,868
I'll be expecting you to chew
someone's bollocks off on demand.

496
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:21,556
Oh, you're back.

497
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:26,873
What do you find in that toilet that's so fascinating?
I'll go and have a pee and a look.

498
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:31,795
What have they got since I was last in there?
Velvet seats, dirty pictures? Hah.

499
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:35,350
Free perfume? A private drinks bar?

500
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:07,593
Oor, what a disgusting smell in here!

501
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:11,309
Must be the pigs using it, eh? How disgusting it is.

502
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:15,393
Ha! Urgh, how horrible. Disgusting.

503
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:18,631
Revolting place, needs airing out. What's this?

504
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:21,075
Gaw, phwoar, phwoar...

505
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:26,915
Look. "There was a young man from Uckinham
who got caught while he was..."

506
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:31,198
That is disgusting!
People ought to be locked up for that.

507
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:34,317
Absolutely appalling. Not what I'm used to at all.

508
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:37,836
It's disgraceful. Don't you reckon, don't you think?

509
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:40,036
Yes. God.

510
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:43,192
- 'Ere, what are you looking at?
- What are you talking about?

511
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:47,478
Don't pretend. You're waiting
for my young associates, aren't you?

512
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:50,677
A man ought to be able to piss
without harassment.

513
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:53,672
- How dare you? I'm getting the manager.
- I am the manager.

514
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:57,753
And you are out on the street.
Oaught loitering in a toilet.

515
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:00,229
- Ow!
- Yeah.

516
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:05,394
That's what these people need.
Short, sharp, shock treatment.

517
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:14,715
Hello. What are you doing? Reading again?

518
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:19,749
This is not a library. The only thing
you're allowed to read in here is the menu.

519
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:22,274
You are insulting the chef.

520
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:25,477
Reading gives you indigestion,
didn't you know that?

521
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:27,790
Don't read at the table.

522
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:33,749
I've just been reading stuff to make your hair curl.

523
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:35,990
Out there, in the toilet.

524
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:39,152
That's the sort of stuff people read, not this.

525
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:41,595
Don't you feel out of touch?

526
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:44,035
Does this stuff make money?

527
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:48,477
You know, I bet you're
the only man who's read this book.

528
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:52,075
But I bet you every man here
has read that stuff out there.

529
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:54,674
It makes you think, doesn't it?

530
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:58,912
You know, I reckon you read
because you got nobody to talk to.

531
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:03,437
I tell you what. So you shouldn't eat alone,
why don't you come and join us?

532
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:05,670
Oome and meet my wife.

533
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:11,073
(Laughs) She's seen you.
I know she's sorry for you sitting here all alone.

534
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:16,109
She likes to read too.
She spends hours sitting on the bed reading.

535
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:18,714
She even reads on the john.

536
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:27,790
This is Oory.

537
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:33,998
This is Mitchel. He can't read, can you, Mitchel?

538
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:37,152
- Yes, I can.
- Yeah. Oomics and dirty magazines.

539
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:41,669
And this is Georgina. She is my wife.

540
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,270
What's your name?

541
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:50,836
- Michael.
- Well, Michael. Is that a Jewish name, Michael?

542
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:56,153
Do you eat kosher food, Michael? Sit down,
Michael, and tell us all about kosher food, Michael.

543
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:59,152
- I'm sorry but I'm not Jewish.
- Why hide it?

544
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:03,631
60%% of the people in this restaurant
are a touch Jewish, Michael.

545
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:05,870
Richard, set another place for Michael.

546
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:10,954
He is Jewish, so maybe you could find him
some spare ribs. No pork.

547
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:17,353
He won't need those.
We're going to hold a conversation, aren't we?

548
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:21,194
You can start, Georgie.
Tell Michael all about yourself.

549
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:26,272
- I'm sure your wife would rather eat in peace.
- No. Talk, Georgina.

550
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:29,955
Here's your chance
to improve your table conversation.

551
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:32,076
Tell Michael you live in a big house

552
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,799
and you spend £400 a week on clothes.

553
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:36,871
I spend £400 a week on clothes.

554
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:40,157
You have a petrol allowance of £40 a week.

555
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:43,915
I have a petrol allowance of £40 a week,
which I never use.

556
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,719
- You wear beautiful things.
- I wear beautiful things.

557
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:49,997
- You eat in the best restaurants.
- I eat in the best restaurants.

558
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:52,753
Georgina, try a little harder, please.

559
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:58,395
- I go to a good hairdresser.
- Yes, the best there is.

560
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:02,393
- I go to a good dentist.
- Yes, yeah, oh, yeah. He's Jewish.

561
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:05,631
- I go to a good gynaecologist.
- You what?

562
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:10,475
- Who says it's unlikely I'll ever have a baby.
- Michael doesn't want to know that.

563
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:13,870
That the three miscarriages
have ruined my insides.

564
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:17,396
That isn't true, Michael doesn't need to know that.

565
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:21,393
Now, drink up, Michael, let's talk about you.
What do you do?

566
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:25,955
I'm a gynaecologist.

567
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:30,392
- You're a what?
- You could always come and see me.

568
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,948
We don't need to discuss that subject.

569
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:36,715
Being infertile makes me a safe bet
for a good screw.

570
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:38,836
Shut up, Georgie!

571
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:44,714
I must apologise for my wife, Michael.

572
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:50,113
If you don't get back to your table,
you're in danger of losing it.

573
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:52,191
The place gets very full about now.

574
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:56,637
Mitchel, take Michael back to his table.
Tell him about horses.

575
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:59,314
Oh, it's all right, Mr Spica, thank you.

576
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:02,595
I prefer to read my book.

577
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:05,834
Besides, I've finished. Thank you.

578
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:10,476
Thank you for introducing me to your wife.

579
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:13,438
I like your name.

580
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:01,516
(Georgina) Ah.

581
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:08,674
- What the hell do you think you're doing? Eh?
- (Knife being sharpened)

582
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:14,676
Telling a complete stranger
intimate details about us?

583
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:17,274
It's not about us. It's about me.

584
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:19,794
It's about us!

585
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:23,236
And what's all this,
how much time you spend in that loo?

586
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:26,312
What's all this about a gynaecologist? Who is he?

587
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:31,520
lt'd better be a she.
I don't want some bloke fingering my wife about.

588
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:34,717
It's a man. He's Jewish.

589
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:39,032
- And he's from Ethiopia.
- What?

590
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:42,908
His mother is a Roman Oatholic,
he's been in prison in South Africa,

591
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:46,919
he's as black as the ace of spades
and probably drinks his own pee.

592
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,150
- Take that, you bitch!
- Oh!

593
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:52,869
You lying, ungrateful bitch! You get in that car.

594
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:55,394
It's the doghouse for you, you bitch.

595
00:54:55,480 --> 00:55:00,235
Bloody gynaecologist. Blasted gynaecologist.

596
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:02,788
(Dogs barking)

597
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:04,996
Get up. Get up.

598
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:10,112
Get in the car, you slag.

599
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:13,470
Get in there. Go on.

600
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:18,396
Yeah.

601
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:21,716
(Dogs yelp)

602
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:45,116
(Albert) Maiser came here.

603
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:49,876
And Trelawny with his black lady friends
who wore peaches in their hair.

604
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:52,076
- (Woman) Peaches?
- Imitation.

605
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:56,631
And the Austrian brothers sat by the door -
high-wire professionals.

606
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,995
Great balancers, sloppy with money.

607
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:05,997
And Tim Tranter drank soup here
out of a cup with a straw when his jaw was broken.

608
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:11,108
There used to be a mark up there
where Goshy Oapps threw a plate of kippers.

609
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:13,714
- Kippers?
- Yes, kippers, for God's sake.

610
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:16,075
(Woman) You wouldn't find kippers here.

611
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:19,994
- They serve kippers for breakfast here.
- (Man) You've had breakfast here?

612
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:22,992
The ferryman and his lady ate here every morning.

613
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:27,278
The ferryman was a poofter.
And fish disagreed with him.

614
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:31,558
- Who are all these people?
- Small-time crooks and pimps...

615
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:34,791
Boarst painted it out.
I'll get him to paint it back again.

616
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:38,509
...gigolos, busted boxers, cheap whores...

617
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:40,795
(Albert) I've got the clippings at home.

618
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:43,872
...bullies, hairdressers, faggots.

619
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:46,428
- (Albert) Robin Hoods.
- No, just hoods.

620
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:51,548
(Albert) You're getting very smart.
(Oory) Smart? Even his slang's out of date.

621
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:55,030
(Albert) Now I'm the clientele,
you understand? Me.

622
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:58,954
And Georgie here and Oory Peterson.
The coq au vin is good.

623
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:02,999
(Man) Oock a what?
(Albert) Ohicken cooked in wine, you mule.

624
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:07,358
- Bess Riddle lived on coq au vin.
- (Man) More of the coq than the vin.

625
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:11,035
- (Grace laughing)
- (Albert) Starkie, there are ladies present.

626
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:14,874
- Or there were. Where's she gone?
- Gracie's no lady, are you?

627
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:18,157
- (Grace) She must have a bladder infection.
- She's one of us.

628
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:21,915
(Albert) There's nothing wrong
except she disappears to the john.

629
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,310
(Man) And which of the bladder infections
do you have, Starkie?

630
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,595
(Man) Ladies go to the toilet, not the john.

631
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:31,912
Real ladies don't go to the toilet,
they go to the bathroom.

632
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:36,315
- (Mitchel) Boarst hasn't got a bathroom.
- (Albert) Shut your mouth.

633
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:40,552
You'd pee in your pants
before you'd recognise a respectable WO.

634
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:51,632
So, he's broken the silence for us

635
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:55,150
and your name is Georgina.

636
00:57:57,320 --> 00:58:01,916
Yes. And don't ever call me Georgie.

637
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:06,314
You have beautiful eyes, Georgina.

638
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:14,559
And you have a beautiful prick, Mr Gynaecologist.

639
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:19,872
- I have?
- Yes, whatever its racist beliefs.

640
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:26,875
- Your husband is a curiosity.
- He is?

641
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:34,069
Why?

642
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:36,196
Why what?

643
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:40,751
Why am I married to him?

644
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:45,316
Why aren't you married?

645
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:47,914
- How do you know I'm not?
- You're not.

646
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:52,716
- I'm not.
- Why?

647
00:58:57,840 --> 00:59:02,595
I once saw a film in which the main character
didn't speak for the first half an hour.

648
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:07,708
Like us? Do all the minutes we've been together
add up to half an hour?

649
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:15,713
I was completely absorbed as to what would
happen because anything was possible.

650
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:19,754
And then?

651
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:22,877
He spoilt it - he spoke.

652
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:28,155
- And?
- Within five minutes, I'd lost interest.

653
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:34,197
So now you've opened your mouth,
do you expect me to lose interest?

654
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:37,910
It was only a film.

655
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:45,631
Erm, now, we've been talking for one minute.

656
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:50,150
We've got four minutes left
before you lose interest.

657
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:52,674
Four minutes. That's enough.

658
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:54,830
Where's the bomb?

659
00:59:54,920 --> 01:00:02,076
He's, er... He's eating
avocado vinaigrette and prawns.

660
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:05,316
With his fingers.

661
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:09,036
Kiss me.

662
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:18,155
- Your restaurant's noisy, Spica.
- It's popular on a Sunday night.

663
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:20,959
I like a quiet restaurant, with floor shows.

664
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:24,715
Boarst is a culinary artist, not a fancy entertainer.

665
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:28,270
But we're here to please you, Terry.
We'll get you a floor show.

666
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:32,433
Oory, phone Santini. Five girls - strippers.

667
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:35,398
Make it decent, will you? My daughter's present.

668
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:39,314
Five dancing girls with music.
Strictly no filth, only class.

669
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:42,392
And make it quiet.
I want to keep my ears till I'm 90.

670
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:46,871
God, Terry, what sort of floor show
do you like? Mute nuns?

671
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:50,953
If they call me Mr Fitch, I might.
I'm only Terry to my wife, Spica.

672
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:54,191
- Like me.
- You're Terry and all, are you?

673
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:57,955
- I'm only Albert to Georgina.
- Even when she's in the loo?

674
01:00:58,040 --> 01:01:01,430
- Shut your whore up, Oory!
- God, you're noisy, Spica.

675
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:05,274
Makes for indigestion.
Don't you find, love? What's your name?

676
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:06,679
Patricia, Mr Fitch.

677
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:10,639
Are you a good dancer?
You look as if you might be a good dancer.

678
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:14,554
We'd like to see you get up and dance, with Geoff.

679
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:16,790
Geoff's a very good dancer.

680
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:20,429
- There's no dancing allowed.
- I always eat at home.

681
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:22,909
- Best place.
- No food poisoning.

682
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:27,835
Ricky Boarst is as safe as houses.
He keeps a very clean kitchen, go and see.

683
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:29,990
I'd like to see.

684
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:35,313
- Mitchel, take the lady to see the kitchen.
- I'll take her myself, Spica.

685
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:41,317
- Show me the way.
- Through that door.

686
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:45,393
I'll call in the bathroom
and send Georgie back tout de suite.

687
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:47,596
That means immediately.

688
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:52,071
- Your new girlfriend's cheap, Oory.
- She's only practising her French.

689
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:54,469
It's a French restaurant, isn't it?

690
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:19,954
Someone's having pheasant for dinner.

691
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:21,996
(Georgina laughs)

692
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:28,311
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven...

693
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:33,159
We could be interrupted, um... 700 times.

694
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:40,551
- What's your boyfriend paying you, Patricia?
- Paying me? He doesn't pay me.

695
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:43,438
He buys me meals and drinks.

696
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:46,432
- Doesn't he give you no pocket money?
- No.

697
01:02:46,520 --> 01:02:50,069
Nothing for a tuna fish sandwich
late at night or a bottle of gin

698
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:53,311
- to make you forget what you had for lunch?
- No.

699
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:56,631
(Sniffs) Phew, it stinks here.

700
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:02,310
Listen, how about if...

701
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:04,470
if I gave you some pocket money?

702
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:07,716
What do I have to do to earn it?

703
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:30,999
OK, here they are. Where's Fitch?

704
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:34,479
Phillipe, clear those tables. We need more space.

705
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:37,552
- But Mr Spica, they are eating.
- Move them.

706
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:41,633
You are in the way of the floor show.
You're gonna have to move.

707
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:43,756
We're in the middle of our meal.

708
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:48,311
If you're going to eat quite quickly,
you can finish your soup.

709
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:52,590
After all, you don't want
to get trampled on, do you?

710
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:55,916
Hold him. Hold him.

711
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,036
(Gasping, screaming)

712
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:01,634
It's a pity you didn't take my advice.

713
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:05,030
All that lovely food. Richard will be disappointed.

714
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:10,831
Now, you're gonna have to eat in the kitchen
like naughty little children, eh?

715
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:13,275
Hey, what is your name?

716
01:04:13,360 --> 01:04:16,875
What did you say? Did I hear you say William?

717
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:20,714
Well, naughty little Willie, tiny little Willie,

718
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:24,031
how would you like
to be spanked on your big, fat bottom?

719
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:26,076
(Gasping)

720
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:36,956
Seeing as you're so keen
on Richard's mushrooms, William,

721
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:41,955
you, I'm gonna give you five, the count of five

722
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:45,749
and I want to see you on the way to the kitchen

723
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:47,831
or you'll be out in the street!

724
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:49,876
Get out.

725
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:53,996
(Shouting)

726
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:58,276
(Screaming)

727
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:02,153
(# Oabaret singer)

728
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:08,471
# I am waiting, I am waiting

729
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:13,598
# Oome up with something sometime now

730
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:19,395
# We're only here for love... #

731
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:22,870
- Oh, look at the time. I must go back.
- One minute more.

732
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:25,554
- No.
- 30 seconds.

733
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:36,716
(Fitch grunting)

734
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:40,239
Oh! Oh!

735
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:43,676
Oh. What the hell are you doing?

736
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:46,832
I bought meself a ride. Why don't you keep still?

737
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:49,150
Sorry, I had a surprise.

738
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:54,390
What bloody surprises
could there be possibly left for you?

739
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:56,516
I give up, you bitch.

740
01:05:57,600 --> 01:05:59,909
I'm sick ofjumpy whores.

741
01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:05,755
You're only worth a Fitch one star -
that ain't for looks, that's for availability.

742
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:08,070
# I am waiting

743
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:11,110
# I am waiting

744
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:16,119
# Oome up with something sometime now

745
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:21,073
# We're only here for love

746
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:24,509
# Outside the reach of money

747
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:26,909
# Beyond the reach of fame

748
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:31,391
# We're not for buying or lending out... #

749
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:34,392
Look who's just come out of the woodwork.

750
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:41,795
# Be quick and be tight

751
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:44,474
# And be it not and be right

752
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:47,199
# Then be slow and... #

753
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:52,718
- (Oory) What've you been doing?
- I've just been earning you good money.

754
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:56,429
And I've just seen
how we can earn ourselves some more.

755
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:00,549
# Then go #

756
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:03,676
(Oheering, applause)

757
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:08,796
(Hollow banging, dogs barking)

758
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:15,391
(lnspector) We have complaints of offensive smells
from two vans on the restaurant premises.

759
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:18,472
The restaurant denies any responsibility. Over.

760
01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:21,120
(Police radio)

761
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:23,156
Why can't we meet somewhere else?

762
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:27,631
That's impossible.
It's better to do it under his nose.

763
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:31,508
He'll never believe I do it right under his nose

764
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:35,589
between courses,

765
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:38,513
between the hors d'oeuvres
and the canard â I'orange,

766
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:40,556
between the dessert and the coffee.

767
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:44,189
Besides,

768
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:47,276
I'm learning fast

769
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:50,476
how to cut corners, save time.

770
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:55,916
I'm getting good at it, aren't I, Michael? Aren't I?

771
01:07:57,320 --> 01:08:00,232
Aren't I getting good at it? Aren't I?

772
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:02,834
Aren't I getting good at it? Mm.

773
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,719
Aren't I getting good at it? Oh.

774
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:09,755
(Dogs barking, police radio)

775
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:16,190
(Albert) Last night was bloody awful
and you're to blame, Oory.

776
01:08:16,280 --> 01:08:20,034
- Tonight you'll starve.
- I don't like the foreign muck anyway.

777
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:24,989
Don't talk to me like that, you uneducated prat!
You couldn't organise a rape in a brothel!

778
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:30,914
The girls were lousy, the music was lousy,
you mucked the whole thing up.

779
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:34,151
Oouldn't keep your own girl
under control at all. Tch!

780
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:36,913
- First she shows off...
- I didn't.

781
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,434
Shut your face, who's talking to you?

782
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:41,670
Then she goes and plays hard to get.

783
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:46,117
I mean, if she's been with you, Oory,
how the hell can she be hard to get?

784
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:53,349
Spangler, get us a drink, quickly.
Then she upsets Fitch in some way.

785
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:56,238
- (Patricia) Fitch is a pig.
- Fitch has got manners.

786
01:08:56,320 --> 01:08:59,312
He was like a bear with a sore head.
Did you piss in his pants?

787
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:03,234
Then she's giggling like a virgin
playing with a candle.

788
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:08,110
You'll have to make it up to him.
He likes you, though you look like a bloke.

789
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:11,829
- Perhaps he likes blokes.
- None of that homosexual talk.

790
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:15,071
He'll remember.
Yesterday evening's got my name on it.

791
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:19,312
I'm not going with him.
He sweats and stinks and he can't make it.

792
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:21,755
- Shut your whore up, Oory.
- Like Georgie?

793
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:25,037
- Shut up!
- She's a fine woman. She's never let me down.

794
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:27,554
- You must be joking.
- Shut up, Pat!

795
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:30,313
- She's upset.
- What do you mean, I must be joking?

796
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:33,198
- Here. Get rid of her.
- Don't do that to a woman.

797
01:09:33,280 --> 01:09:36,352
- I do what I like to a woman.
- That's your trouble.

798
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:40,433
No wonder Georgie looks like she does
and hates your guts.

799
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:43,671
- What are you talking about?
- No wonder she screws around.

800
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:47,309
- You what?
- You're so bloody blind, you'd never notice.

801
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:50,119
- Shut up! She's raving.
- I'm not. I saw them.

802
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:52,156
- Who?
- Georgie and that Jew.

803
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:55,869
- What Jew?
- That bloke who sits over there, reading.

804
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:59,748
Haven't you noticed?
They always go off to the john together.

805
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:04,356
- You what?
- Why do you think Georgie's always in the john?

806
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:08,194
You blind bat.
She doesn't have the shits every five minutes.

807
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:10,996
Shit!

808
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:13,756
(Patricia cries)

809
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:20,312
Shh. It's all right. It's all right. Shh. Quiet.

810
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:22,356
Shh. Shh.

811
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:26,036
Shh.

812
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:37,436
(Patricia sobbing)

813
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:50,150
I'm going to the loo.

814
01:10:56,120 --> 01:10:58,270
(Gasping, screaming)

815
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,956
Georgina!

816
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:04,916
Georgina!

817
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:08,997
Georgina, where are you, you bitch? Georgina!

818
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:13,433
- What are you doing? Get out!
- Get out, you bitch. Georgina!

819
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:15,476
Where are you? Get out!

820
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:17,596
- (Screaming)
- Go on, get out!

821
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:19,796
Where are you?

822
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:23,589
- No, please!
- Get out of here! Get out, you...

823
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:27,593
Please, no! Please, no!

824
01:11:27,680 --> 01:11:30,274
- Go on! Georgie!
- Please, no.

825
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:32,676
Where are you, Georgie?

826
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:38,076
(Ooughing, retching)

827
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:40,116
(Flies buzzing)

828
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:50,552
- (Shouting, pots clattering)
- (Whispering) It's over. He has found out.

829
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:54,189
- (Albert) Georgina? Georgina!
- (Falling cutlery)

830
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:56,510
- (Banging)
- Georgina!

831
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:59,558
- Georgie! You get out.
- (Woman screams)

832
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:01,232
(Orashing)

833
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:04,073
I'll get him to leave.

834
01:12:04,160 --> 01:12:07,948
- Richard, don't get into trouble over me.
- Georgie!

835
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:09,996
(Woman screaming)

836
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:13,390
- Let's go and face him.
- Don't be mad. He'll kill you!

837
01:12:13,480 --> 01:12:15,710
Oome quickly. Oome with me.

838
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:24,439
- Wait here five minutes.
- (Michael) We'll freeze to death.

839
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:28,752
He will never look in here.
Only five minutes. I will get your clothes.

840
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:32,037
(Albert, distant) Georgie, where are you?

841
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:37,988
- Georgina! Georgie, where are you?
- (Glass smashing)

842
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:40,150
Georgie. Georgie.

843
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:44,150
You! Where is she? Where's my wife?

844
01:12:44,240 --> 01:12:47,437
- What's the matter?
- You know. Fetching her cigarettes.

845
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:50,318
- Where's my wife?
- (Richard) Your wife is your affair.

846
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:53,039
This is not a lost property office.

847
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:55,475
I want my wife! Where is she?

848
01:12:55,560 --> 01:12:59,269
You! You stupid little rat.
Where's my wife? Where is she?

849
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:03,558
If you have finished,
I'll ask you to leave the kitchen.

850
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:07,553
- I have other diners to consider.
- Oh! Uh!

851
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:11,315
I'm the only diner who matters here.
I own this restaurant.

852
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:14,472
I want my wife. You've hidden her. Where is she?

853
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:17,715
God keep me calm! Where are they?

854
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:20,792
Georgina! Georgina!

855
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:24,556
- Georgina! Georgina!
- Ahh!

856
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:28,318
Georgina! Where is she, Boarst?

857
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:35,596
Boarst, where is she? Georgie! Georgie!

858
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:39,240
Georgie, you bitch!

859
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:42,834
(lnspector) Hard around.

860
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:44,876
(Dogs barking)

861
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:49,711
Georgie! I want my wife!

862
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:53,316
(Screaming)

863
01:13:58,520 --> 01:14:00,476
(Albert) Georgie!

864
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:05,596
I'll bloody find her.

865
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:08,116
I'll bloody find her.

866
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:13,194
I'll find them. I'll bloody find them.
I knew it. Scheming tart!

867
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:15,919
I'll bloody find them and I'll bloody kill him!

868
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,956
And I'll bloody eat him!

869
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:20,679
I'll kill him and I'll eat him!

870
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:25,313
- I'll kill him and then I'll eat him.
- (Georgina) Oh, shit!

871
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:28,392
- (Police radio)
- I'll eat him!

872
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:31,716
I'll eat him!

873
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:36,590
We can get you out.
Eden can drive you. Where do you want to go?

874
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:38,796
I know a place.

875
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:42,475
- What about our clothes?
- I'll get them to you. Quickly.

876
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:45,516
Quickly. Quick.

877
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:06,159
No. No. No, no.

878
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:09,198
No, please. Aah! No.

879
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:16,516
(Flies buzzing)

880
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:18,636
(Georgina sobbing)

881
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:31,876
(Georgina gasping)

882
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:44,996
(Oreaking)

883
01:16:46,280 --> 01:16:48,510
What is this place?

884
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:51,478
It's a book depository.

885
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:55,394
When my bookshop is quiet,
I do a stocktaking job.

886
01:16:56,760 --> 01:16:59,832
I'm cataloguing French history.

887
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:05,953
There's a kitchen and a bathroom.

888
01:17:06,040 --> 01:17:09,999
It's a bit primitive but there's an extraordinary view.

889
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:12,355
Have you read all these books?

890
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:14,476
No.

891
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:20,112
It's not necessary
for the book-keeper to read all the stock.

892
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:23,237
With a job like this, you could be very boring.

893
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:27,676
Are we safe here?

894
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:32,111
Does Albert read?

895
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:34,156
No.

896
01:17:36,720 --> 01:17:39,359
If you don't read, does that make you safe?

897
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:41,556
Only from bad books.

898
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:46,238
You could spend a lifetime in here reading.

899
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:52,589
You could. Two lifetimes - yours and mine.

900
01:17:52,680 --> 01:17:55,114
- Is that what I'm in for?
- No.

901
01:18:00,040 --> 01:18:03,953
What good are all these books to you?
You can't eat them.

902
01:18:04,040 --> 01:18:06,759
How can they make you happy?

903
01:18:06,840 --> 01:18:09,593
I've always found them very reasonable.

904
01:18:09,680 --> 01:18:12,831
They don't change their minds
when you're not looking.

905
01:18:12,920 --> 01:18:15,514
That sounds like a disadvantage to me.

906
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:19,956
Kiss me.

907
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:24,788
# Wash me thoroughly

908
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:28,111
# From my iniquity

909
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:31,189
# And blot out... #

910
01:18:32,160 --> 01:18:34,390
- I...
- # Blot out...

911
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:36,277
- I think perhaps...
- # My...? #

912
01:18:36,360 --> 01:18:39,716
I think perhaps we'll leave the singing.

913
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:42,758
Do you agree, until later, maybe?

914
01:18:46,720 --> 01:18:49,109
How is the restaurant?

915
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:53,318
- It's all right.
- And Richard? Mr Boarst?

916
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:55,550
He's fine.

917
01:18:57,080 --> 01:18:59,992
Is there any more trouble,

918
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:02,950
er, like last night?

919
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:05,713
- No, sir.
- Would you like to join us?

920
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:12,829
No, thank you. I'll eat later with Mr Boarst.

921
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:28,516
Enjoy your meal.

922
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:30,556
Thank you.

923
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:40,477
Erm, have you any other news to tell us?

924
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:46,793
Mr Boarst says... He told me to tell you to stay put

925
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:50,395
and he wishes you bon appétit.

926
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:52,436
Thank you.

927
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:02,872
When you're finished, I'm to take the dishes back.

928
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:09,909
Oh, if you find any of those books interesting,
you can borrow them.

929
01:20:40,360 --> 01:20:42,590
Wa-woo! Di-di-di-di-dah-da!

930
01:20:46,440 --> 01:20:48,396
(Dogs barking)

931
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:54,799
All right, where are they? Where are they?

932
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:58,319
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

933
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:02,951
I don't suppose you ate all this yourself.
What have we got in here? Let's see. Ah.

934
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:07,192
Fish sauce with mayonnaise
and a touch of basil. I like basil.

935
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:09,635
What else we got in here? Aha.

936
01:21:09,720 --> 01:21:13,190
It's sticky. Don't tell me.
Ohocolate sauce - profiteroles.

937
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:16,192
Georgina liked profiteroles.

938
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:20,918
Oh, and serviettes
with Georgina's lipstick on them.

939
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,753
And a nice bottle of wine. Very nice.

940
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:26,798
He's for the chop, Richard.
I'll get my hands on him.

941
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:31,192
Leave that bread roll alone. I need to know
where they are. Where are they? Eh?

942
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:36,434
Ah. Ah. That's good.
Open your mouth. Oome on, open it.

943
01:21:36,520 --> 01:21:40,115
- Take an interest in your food.
- (Mews) We don't need to do this.

944
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:43,476
- Getting squeamish?
- He's just a kid.

945
01:21:43,560 --> 01:21:47,394
- Stand him up and get his trousers down.
- Leave him alone.

946
01:21:47,480 --> 01:21:52,759
Get out. Who needs fairies like you?
And take your four-eyed cousin with you.

947
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:58,119
See how you get on in the streets without
me to wipe your noses. Get lost! Righto.

948
01:21:58,200 --> 01:22:01,397
OK, button eater, tell me where they are.

949
01:22:01,480 --> 01:22:03,436
(Screaming)

950
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:07,515
OK, button eater, where are they?

951
01:22:08,720 --> 01:22:12,838
We've run out of buttons.
But there is one more button.

952
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:16,196
It's your belly button.
How'd you like to swallow that?

953
01:22:16,280 --> 01:22:18,430
- Albert!
- You still here?

954
01:22:18,520 --> 01:22:21,273
- (Shrieking)
- Well, then, watch this.

955
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:33,511
Wake him up! Wake him up, wake him up.
I must find out where she is!

956
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:35,556
Wake him up!

957
01:22:36,520 --> 01:22:38,476
Wake him up!

958
01:22:39,480 --> 01:22:44,156
Where are they?
If he comes to, he better start to talk.

959
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:53,954
(Albert laughs) I got 'em!

960
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:39,636
I have brought your dinner.

961
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:50,229
(Whispers) Where's the kitchen lad?

962
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:53,949
- He is in hospital.
- What?

963
01:23:57,280 --> 01:24:01,717
He said he told them nothing and I believe him.

964
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:05,839
- I must see him.
- (Richard) I don't think that's wise.

965
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:07,876
I'm coming.

966
01:24:08,680 --> 01:24:11,148
You must take me to him.

967
01:24:11,240 --> 01:24:14,471
- Start packing.
- (Michael) What have we got to pack?

968
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:18,957
Richard. Richard, bring that for Pup.

969
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:22,476
What can you do? You only endanger yourself.

970
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,195
I'll only be gone an hour.

971
01:24:26,280 --> 01:24:29,352
Richard, you can bring me back, can't you?

972
01:24:31,320 --> 01:24:34,790
Oh, poor Pup. Oh, poor Pup.

973
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:36,836
(Sobs)

974
01:24:42,120 --> 01:24:44,350
Leave me something to eat.

975
01:24:44,440 --> 01:24:46,431
Of course.

976
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:51,076
Please be very careful.

977
01:24:56,400 --> 01:24:58,356
(Front door closes)

978
01:25:16,200 --> 01:25:22,958
(Pup) # Have mercy upon me

979
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:30,748
# Have mercy upon me

980
01:25:32,240 --> 01:25:38,759
# Blot out my transgressions

981
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:46,553
# Blot out my transgressions

982
01:25:47,520 --> 01:25:54,312
# Purge me with hyssop... #

983
01:25:56,680 --> 01:25:58,636
Thank you.

984
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:08,919
# Wash me, wash me

985
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:16,350
# And I shall be whiter than snow... #

986
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:27,074
- Hold him by his hair.
- (Ohoking, gagging)

987
01:26:27,160 --> 01:26:29,230
(Mitchel) He hasn't got much hair to hold.

988
01:26:29,320 --> 01:26:32,869
- Disgusting to be that old and to be her lover.
- (Mews) Same age as you.

989
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:37,476
- I'm her husband, not her lover.
- You can only be one and not the other?

990
01:26:37,560 --> 01:26:43,908
If he'd been younger, I could've understood.
He'd just be a passing fancy. You bastard!

991
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:47,959
Right, Mitchel, now's your chance.
You are gonna chew bollocks.

992
01:26:48,040 --> 01:26:50,600
- (Mitchel) He's too old.
- What's that mean?

993
01:26:50,680 --> 01:26:53,353
He's the same age as me - 40, almost.

994
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:56,318
If he was younger it would've been all right?

995
01:26:56,400 --> 01:27:00,359
My God. When you're 17, is being 40 old?

996
01:27:00,440 --> 01:27:07,073
- (Mitchel) He probably hasn't had a bath recently.
- (Laughs) God, Mitchel, you are a prize mule.

997
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:10,516
Well, I mean, certainly...

998
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:14,275
- He must've been with Georgina last night.
- No! Shut up.

999
01:27:14,360 --> 01:27:16,954
Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up!

1000
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:19,315
You pissing little worm.

1001
01:27:21,160 --> 01:27:23,310
God, you are an idiot, Mitchel.

1002
01:27:23,400 --> 01:27:27,518
You can be guaranteed
to say the wrong thing at the right time.

1003
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:31,878
I didn't mean that you literally
had to chew his bollocks off.

1004
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:34,713
I meant it metaphorically.

1005
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:36,870
What does that mean, Albert?

1006
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:40,236
"Jewish Book-keeper Savaged
By Young Sex Maniac."

1007
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:43,790
- (Michael choking)
- I don't want this to look like a sex murder.

1008
01:27:43,880 --> 01:27:48,954
It's a revenge killing, an affair of the heart,
a crime passionnel.

1009
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:52,430
- I want no evil gossip spread around about me.
- (Gurgling cries)

1010
01:27:52,520 --> 01:27:57,958
They are not going to say... They are going
to say this was a dignified revenge killing.

1011
01:27:58,040 --> 01:28:00,076
They're gonna admire the style.

1012
01:28:00,160 --> 01:28:04,153
"He was stuffed. And Albert liked good food."

1013
01:28:04,240 --> 01:28:08,472
They might even smile.
"He was stuffed with the tools of his trade."

1014
01:28:09,280 --> 01:28:14,149
"He was stuffed with books.
The crummy little book-keeper was..."

1015
01:28:14,240 --> 01:28:18,836
Mitchel, no unnecessary... No unnecessaries.

1016
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:25,040
Finish him off! Shut his mouth, hold his nose,
ram the bloody books down his throat.

1017
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:27,509
Suffocate the bastard!

1018
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:36,470
(Georgina) Michael!

1019
01:28:46,040 --> 01:28:47,473
Michael.

1020
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:14,236
OK, so this is how you eat the crayfish.
First, you snap off the head.

1021
01:29:14,320 --> 01:29:15,469
(Orunching)

1022
01:29:15,560 --> 01:29:17,551
Then you pull out the whiskers,

1023
01:29:17,640 --> 01:29:19,870
then you strip off the legs.

1024
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:28,392
And then you poke out the soft part of the body.

1025
01:29:28,480 --> 01:29:32,029
- You turn the light out?
- (Mitchel) What light?

1026
01:29:32,760 --> 01:29:37,276
Idiot. You wouldn't remember to fart.
Place might burn down with all them books.

1027
01:29:37,360 --> 01:29:41,831
- That would nicely destroy the evidence.
- I don't want it destroyed, idiot!

1028
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:43,672
I want Georgina to see it.

1029
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:45,910
What did he say?

1030
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:50,039
The French Revolution
was easier to swallow than Napoleon.

1031
01:30:50,120 --> 01:30:53,715
Napoleon was a prat. He threw everything away.

1032
01:30:53,800 --> 01:30:58,954
Napoleon liked seafood.
His favourite dish was oysters Florentine.

1033
01:30:59,040 --> 01:31:02,237
It's amazing, isn't it? Ohurchill liked seafood.

1034
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:06,074
All the great generals were keen on seafood.

1035
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:09,072
What did Julius Oaesar like, or Hitler?

1036
01:31:09,160 --> 01:31:12,391
Hitler liked clams. And Mussolini liked squid.

1037
01:31:12,480 --> 01:31:15,199
- You're making it up.
- What do you know, Harris?

1038
01:31:15,280 --> 01:31:18,556
- What did the bookseller eat?
- You could tell from his vomit.

1039
01:31:18,640 --> 01:31:22,713
What do I care what he ate?
It all comes out as shit in the end.

1040
01:31:39,520 --> 01:31:41,476
(Sighs)

1041
01:31:42,200 --> 01:31:44,191
I'm so tired.

1042
01:31:47,080 --> 01:31:49,196
I'm going to sleep.

1043
01:32:03,480 --> 01:32:06,358
I've got a lot to tell you in the morning.

1044
01:32:07,480 --> 01:32:09,630
And I want you to listen.

1045
01:32:11,560 --> 01:32:14,996
Somebody should know.
And who can I tell but you?

1046
01:32:19,160 --> 01:32:21,515
And then...

1047
01:32:25,680 --> 01:32:27,910
when I wake up in the morning,

1048
01:32:32,040 --> 01:32:34,190
I want you to kiss me.

1049
01:32:38,440 --> 01:32:40,670
And then I want breakfast.

1050
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:45,355
Erm, coffee and fresh rolls and butter

1051
01:32:47,800 --> 01:32:49,870
and marmalade.

1052
01:32:50,840 --> 01:32:53,912
And toast.

1053
01:32:55,040 --> 01:32:57,110
And...

1054
01:32:59,080 --> 01:33:01,150
Good night, Michael.

1055
01:33:06,280 --> 01:33:08,589
I'll see you in the morning.

1056
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:14,836
I love you.

1057
01:33:16,480 --> 01:33:19,711
- You shouldn't have done it. It wasn't worth it.
- You what?

1058
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:23,998
Georgina wasn't worth it?
How bloody dare you say that?

1059
01:33:24,080 --> 01:33:28,631
Georgina's worth a thousand
snooty little Jewish book-keeping clerks

1060
01:33:28,720 --> 01:33:31,632
who masturbate over the French Revolution.

1061
01:33:31,720 --> 01:33:36,748
The book-keeper will get us into trouble
and he wasn't worth it. Oalm down.

1062
01:33:36,840 --> 01:33:42,039
Little circumcised mediocrity
was screwing my wife! I will not calm down!

1063
01:33:42,120 --> 01:33:46,238
I've seen you, Harris, eyeing Georgina,
looking at another man's wife.

1064
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:49,995
I've seen you watch her skirt fly up
when she got out of the car.

1065
01:33:50,080 --> 01:33:52,514
Yes, I've seen you sniffing her, Harris.

1066
01:33:52,600 --> 01:33:55,956
And to think I ever trusted you with her,

1067
01:33:56,720 --> 01:33:59,917
that I ever trusted you to drive her home
when I was drunk.

1068
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,833
- You get out of this restaurant!
- Oalm down.

1069
01:34:02,920 --> 01:34:06,390
Mitchel, get Richard.
I want this man banned. Get out!

1070
01:34:06,480 --> 01:34:09,916
- If you want to shout...
- I can shout in my own restaurant!

1071
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:13,754
I own this restaurant. Get out! Fuck you!

1072
01:34:15,680 --> 01:34:19,468
Go, you mule! Richard, I'm closing you up.

1073
01:34:19,560 --> 01:34:23,269
- Really?
- You are finished, Richard.

1074
01:34:23,360 --> 01:34:28,559
Allowing decent people to dine
with wife snatchers. You're finished!

1075
01:34:28,640 --> 01:34:30,710
I think not, Mr Spica!

1076
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:36,079
And if I did, where would you eat?
Who would have you?

1077
01:34:36,160 --> 01:34:41,154
Now, if you'd kindly leave,
we can start clearing up the mess you have made.

1078
01:34:41,240 --> 01:34:46,109
I'm warning you. Tomorrow
your restaurant will be just one big car park.

1079
01:34:46,200 --> 01:34:48,634
- Nothing more.
- I wonder how you will do that.

1080
01:34:48,720 --> 01:34:53,669
A bulldozer, Richard.
Your cuisine will be 20 feet under brick dust.

1081
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:57,036
Get out of it, Harris. You get out of it.

1082
01:34:57,120 --> 01:35:00,954
Go on. I can tell loyalty when I see it.

1083
01:35:24,880 --> 01:35:27,030
Well, Michael,

1084
01:35:29,160 --> 01:35:31,276
you didn't kiss me

1085
01:35:33,400 --> 01:35:35,356
so...

1086
01:35:37,880 --> 01:35:40,678
I suppose I have to make my own breakfast.

1087
01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:45,830
Don't get up yet.

1088
01:36:01,560 --> 01:36:03,596
Well, Michael,

1089
01:36:06,520 --> 01:36:08,511
that's that.

1090
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:13,196
Short and very sweet.

1091
01:36:16,240 --> 01:36:20,438
Now you're not listening,
I suppose I could tell you about Albert.

1092
01:36:21,520 --> 01:36:26,310
I meant to tell you eventually
but I'd have to know you better because...

1093
01:36:26,400 --> 01:36:28,914
Well, because I'd be so ashamed.

1094
01:36:31,600 --> 01:36:35,957
But it's important that I tell you now
so that I can have done with it.

1095
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:47,358
Albert beat me. Well, I know you know that.
You saw the bruises.

1096
01:36:48,600 --> 01:36:50,795
He was regular in his habits.

1097
01:36:56,080 --> 01:36:59,595
When we got back from the restaurant,
he'd make me get a hot, wet towel

1098
01:36:59,680 --> 01:37:01,875
and accompany him to the toilet.

1099
01:37:03,960 --> 01:37:06,110
And I'd have to wipe his...

1100
01:37:10,160 --> 01:37:13,197
After I finished, he... he made... Oh...

1101
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:19,590
Help me, Michael.

1102
01:37:23,120 --> 01:37:27,875
On his side of the bed he had
a suitcase with all kinds of objects in it.

1103
01:37:27,960 --> 01:37:30,076
Er, a toothbrush,

1104
01:37:31,880 --> 01:37:33,950
a wooden spoon,

1105
01:37:37,320 --> 01:37:39,470
a plastic train,

1106
01:37:40,760 --> 01:37:42,716
a wine bottle.

1107
01:37:42,800 --> 01:37:44,916
And he'd use them.

1108
01:37:46,600 --> 01:37:51,116
If I didn't do it whilst he watched,
he'd insist on doing it himself.

1109
01:37:52,760 --> 01:37:55,718
At least when I did it, it hurt less.

1110
01:37:58,120 --> 01:38:02,910
I don't think he was very interested in sex -
not with me, not with women.

1111
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:09,116
I left him four times.

1112
01:38:10,960 --> 01:38:13,110
I caught the night ferry.

1113
01:38:15,480 --> 01:38:19,393
He and Harris found me in Brussels,
they brought me back.

1114
01:38:20,720 --> 01:38:23,792
On the boat, Albert cried, bought me presents.

1115
01:38:25,880 --> 01:38:30,431
But then after we landed,
when we gotjust outside the harbour,

1116
01:38:30,520 --> 01:38:33,193
before the motorway, he stopped the car

1117
01:38:33,280 --> 01:38:38,115
and he and Harris and Spangler dragged me out
and stripped me and beat me.

1118
01:38:44,160 --> 01:38:46,116
'Michael,

1119
01:38:48,360 --> 01:38:50,476
'all this must finish.

1120
01:38:52,480 --> 01:38:55,438
'Help me, Michael. Please.'

1121
01:39:02,600 --> 01:39:04,636
He's dead.

1122
01:39:07,080 --> 01:39:12,074
They stuffed his mouth with paper
ripped from his favourite book.

1123
01:39:12,160 --> 01:39:15,038
- Oould you cook him?
- Oook who, Georgina?

1124
01:39:16,480 --> 01:39:18,436
Michael.

1125
01:39:18,520 --> 01:39:21,193
No. Mon dieu, non.

1126
01:39:23,880 --> 01:39:28,715
You have a reputation
for a wide range of experimental dishes.

1127
01:39:31,040 --> 01:39:33,395
He might taste good.

1128
01:39:33,480 --> 01:39:35,630
I'm sure he would taste good.

1129
01:39:35,720 --> 01:39:38,075
What would taste best?

1130
01:39:38,160 --> 01:39:41,277
His heart? His liver?

1131
01:39:41,360 --> 01:39:43,999
The cheeks of his backside?

1132
01:39:44,080 --> 01:39:47,390
(Laughs) His prairie oysters?

1133
01:39:49,880 --> 01:39:51,950
Georgina,

1134
01:39:52,040 --> 01:39:54,031
sit down.

1135
01:39:55,280 --> 01:39:57,271
Sit down.

1136
01:39:59,920 --> 01:40:03,276
When you make out a menu,
how do you price each dish?

1137
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:09,037
I charge a lot for anything black.

1138
01:40:09,120 --> 01:40:13,113
Grapes, olives, blackcurrants.

1139
01:40:16,120 --> 01:40:18,953
People like to remind themselves of death,

1140
01:40:19,800 --> 01:40:23,588
eating black food is like consuming death,

1141
01:40:24,680 --> 01:40:31,199
like saying, "Death, I'm eating you."

1142
01:40:31,280 --> 01:40:35,353
Black truffles are the most expensive. And caviar.

1143
01:40:37,200 --> 01:40:39,555
Death and birth.

1144
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:43,519
The end and the beginning.

1145
01:40:44,760 --> 01:40:49,754
Don't you think it's appropriate
that the most expensive items are black?

1146
01:40:53,440 --> 01:40:55,670
We also charge for vanity.

1147
01:40:56,720 --> 01:40:59,598
Diet foods have an additional surcharge

1148
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:03,269
of 30%% .

1149
01:41:04,120 --> 01:41:06,918
Aphrodisiacs, 50%% .

1150
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:11,949
And from what I saw,
your lover did not need an aphrodisiac.

1151
01:41:12,840 --> 01:41:16,549
What did you see? I want to know.

1152
01:41:17,680 --> 01:41:19,636
Nobody knew but you.

1153
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:23,916
Everyone pitied me. Even you pitied me.

1154
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:27,754
And how can I know that he loved me
if there were no witnesses?

1155
01:41:29,040 --> 01:41:34,034
If you loved him, that does not seem
to be a very necessary question.

1156
01:41:34,120 --> 01:41:37,112
Yes, it does! Tell me what you know!

1157
01:41:40,240 --> 01:41:43,118
What I saw was what you let me see.

1158
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:47,556
Of course it was.

1159
01:41:48,440 --> 01:41:52,877
How could I know that it was real
unless someone else was watching?

1160
01:41:55,160 --> 01:41:57,276
Tell me what you saw.

1161
01:41:58,240 --> 01:42:00,470
Or are you ashamed to tell me?

1162
01:42:04,120 --> 01:42:06,270
No.

1163
01:42:06,360 --> 01:42:08,635
I saw him kissing you

1164
01:42:10,680 --> 01:42:12,716
on the mouth,

1165
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:16,836
on the neck,

1166
01:42:17,640 --> 01:42:19,710
behind your ear.

1167
01:42:23,320 --> 01:42:25,629
I saw him undressing you.

1168
01:42:30,080 --> 01:42:32,275
I saw him kissing your breasts.

1169
01:42:36,040 --> 01:42:39,749
I saw him put his hand between your legs.

1170
01:42:42,080 --> 01:42:44,355
And what did you see me do?

1171
01:42:47,920 --> 01:42:49,990
I saw you kiss him on the mouth.

1172
01:42:54,080 --> 01:42:58,358
I saw you lying under him on the floor of the pantry.

1173
01:43:01,720 --> 01:43:04,837
I saw him take you from behind.

1174
01:43:09,320 --> 01:43:12,995
I saw you take his penis in your mouth.

1175
01:43:16,120 --> 01:43:18,395
I saw you...

1176
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:37,314
Do lovers always behave like that?

1177
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:45,072
My parents behaved like that.

1178
01:43:45,160 --> 01:43:47,116
They did?

1179
01:43:47,200 --> 01:43:51,478
- You saw them?
- And lovers in the cinema behave like that.

1180
01:43:51,560 --> 01:43:53,596
No, that doesn't count.

1181
01:43:53,680 --> 01:43:58,435
And in my fantasies,
lovers always behave like that.

1182
01:43:58,520 --> 01:44:01,193
Were you jealous?

1183
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:03,396
Did we make you jealous?

1184
01:44:04,640 --> 01:44:06,756
Did you want to join us?

1185
01:44:07,840 --> 01:44:11,276
- If you did, help me now.
- Georgina, no.

1186
01:44:11,360 --> 01:44:16,514
In memory of us making love in your kitchen
and in your fantasies, help me now.

1187
01:44:16,600 --> 01:44:19,160
No.

1188
01:44:19,240 --> 01:44:23,199
In memory of your parents making love,
help me now.

1189
01:44:23,280 --> 01:44:25,236
Georgina, no!

1190
01:44:26,160 --> 01:44:28,674
People I like learn my name too late.

1191
01:44:30,120 --> 01:44:32,270
Too late?

1192
01:44:33,440 --> 01:44:35,556
Oook Michael for me.

1193
01:44:35,640 --> 01:44:37,596
No.

1194
01:44:38,640 --> 01:44:41,200
This was his favourite restaurant.

1195
01:44:42,160 --> 01:44:44,196
It's also mine.

1196
01:44:45,160 --> 01:44:47,230
Oook Michael for me.

1197
01:44:48,680 --> 01:44:51,433
If I did,

1198
01:44:51,520 --> 01:44:54,398
who would ever eat here again?

1199
01:44:58,400 --> 01:45:00,675
How can I make you change your mind?

1200
01:45:04,080 --> 01:45:07,629
Do you want to make love with me?
You can do what he did.

1201
01:45:11,240 --> 01:45:13,435
How can I persuade you?

1202
01:45:14,200 --> 01:45:16,475
You can't. You may have loved him...

1203
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:19,028
You know I did, you saw me.

1204
01:45:20,560 --> 01:45:23,472
But you don't have to eat him, Georgina.

1205
01:45:23,560 --> 01:45:28,111
Do you... do you have some idea
that by eating him

1206
01:45:28,200 --> 01:45:30,555
he can become part of you?

1207
01:45:30,640 --> 01:45:34,952
You can't believe that by eating him
you can always be together!

1208
01:45:35,880 --> 01:45:37,996
I'm not eating him.

1209
01:45:40,960 --> 01:45:43,838
- Albert is.
- Albert?

1210
01:45:48,440 --> 01:45:50,874
There's £11,000. It's Michael's.

1211
01:45:58,120 --> 01:46:00,270
Put your money away.

1212
01:46:06,800 --> 01:46:08,870
Where is he?

1213
01:46:20,120 --> 01:46:22,156
(Georgina moaning)

1214
01:46:43,760 --> 01:46:45,796
(Georgina crying)

1215
01:46:57,920 --> 01:46:59,876
(Hollow banging)

1216
01:47:46,480 --> 01:47:48,471
(Banging on glass)

1217
01:47:50,280 --> 01:47:52,350
What's going on here?

1218
01:47:52,440 --> 01:47:56,479
Why do I suddenly have to come in
to my own restaurant like a stranger?

1219
01:47:56,560 --> 01:47:58,630
Special invitations.

1220
01:47:59,640 --> 01:48:02,916
Which I might say
could've gone to a better printer.

1221
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,594
I have to bang on the door like an outcast.

1222
01:48:07,320 --> 01:48:09,276
Well, well, well.

1223
01:48:09,360 --> 01:48:14,275
Georgina Duckles.
What brings you here, you bitch?

1224
01:48:15,120 --> 01:48:18,556
I'm very surprised
you show your face here, you slut.

1225
01:48:18,640 --> 01:48:22,349
Where you been? Albert has been frantic.

1226
01:48:22,440 --> 01:48:24,954
Shut up, Grace. Find me a drink.

1227
01:48:25,040 --> 01:48:29,113
- Happy anniversary, Albert.
- I'll bloody kill you for what you did!

1228
01:48:29,200 --> 01:48:32,670
- You should find that easy.
- Don't think I'm taking you back.

1229
01:48:32,760 --> 01:48:34,830
I'll make you pay, you slut.

1230
01:48:34,920 --> 01:48:38,390
Your bottom's going to be
very, very sore for weeks.

1231
01:48:39,440 --> 01:48:43,592
No more books for you, girl.
You're staying in under lock and key.

1232
01:48:43,680 --> 01:48:48,196
There's going to be no more books
or prick-sniffing for you, girl.

1233
01:48:49,600 --> 01:48:51,909
Happy anniversary, Albert.

1234
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:55,675
What are you talking about? It's not my birthday.

1235
01:48:55,760 --> 01:49:02,108
No, but it's an anniversary that I shall
always celebrate, even if you won't. And you won't.

1236
01:49:02,200 --> 01:49:06,751
- What? Where is everybody?
- They'll be here presently.

1237
01:49:06,840 --> 01:49:09,434
- Look, Georgina.
- What?

1238
01:49:09,520 --> 01:49:12,990
- It's all over now.
- What is?

1239
01:49:13,080 --> 01:49:16,311
- Grace, just go and look out of a window.
- Oh.

1240
01:49:16,400 --> 01:49:18,709
Mitchel, bugger off out of it.

1241
01:49:18,800 --> 01:49:21,758
Look, Georgina, when the others arrive...

1242
01:49:21,840 --> 01:49:24,798
Where are they? The invitation says nine o'clock.

1243
01:49:24,880 --> 01:49:28,350
- Where are they gonna sit?
- They'll be here presently.

1244
01:49:28,440 --> 01:49:32,319
Look, Georgina, you didn't...
didn't really like him, did you?

1245
01:49:32,400 --> 01:49:37,394
I mean, how could you like
a bloody book-keeper, a nobody?

1246
01:49:38,400 --> 01:49:42,951
I tell you what. I'll try... We'll forget it, eh?

1247
01:49:43,760 --> 01:49:46,320
Eh? Oome home with me.

1248
01:49:46,400 --> 01:49:50,598
Tell you the truth, Georgie,
I've been a bit miserable.

1249
01:49:50,680 --> 01:49:54,639
- Since it is your anniversary...
- What bloody anniversary?

1250
01:49:54,720 --> 01:49:56,676
I've brought you a present.

1251
01:49:56,760 --> 01:50:00,309
I don't need presents.
It's me who gives you presents.

1252
01:50:00,400 --> 01:50:03,995
Besides, you've never had
the money to give me presents.

1253
01:50:04,080 --> 01:50:06,389
And Richard has cooked it for you.

1254
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:09,999
- Under my instructions.
- Oh?

1255
01:50:10,080 --> 01:50:12,071
Knowing how you like to eat.

1256
01:50:13,080 --> 01:50:15,719
Knowing how you like to gorge yourself.

1257
01:50:16,840 --> 01:50:19,957
And we've brought a few of your friends around.

1258
01:51:23,640 --> 01:51:26,313
(Albert) What sort of party is this, Georgie?

1259
01:51:27,960 --> 01:51:31,350
- What's going on?
- Sit down, Albert.

1260
01:51:32,400 --> 01:51:34,516
Oan't I sit down, Georgina?

1261
01:51:34,600 --> 01:51:36,955
No, this is Albert's special treat.

1262
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:44,597
- Here, I'm not eating with that Roy there.
- Shut up, Albert.

1263
01:51:46,520 --> 01:51:48,829
You're here to enjoy yourself.

1264
01:51:59,400 --> 01:52:01,356
Georgie.

1265
01:52:17,120 --> 01:52:19,270
Jesus!

1266
01:52:19,360 --> 01:52:20,793
God.

1267
01:52:24,720 --> 01:52:28,190
(Georgina) No, it's not God, Albert. It's Michael.

1268
01:52:29,840 --> 01:52:31,796
My lover.

1269
01:52:32,760 --> 01:52:35,718
You vowed you would kill him, and you did.

1270
01:52:37,640 --> 01:52:39,915
And you vowed you would eat him.

1271
01:52:41,560 --> 01:52:43,790
Now eat him.

1272
01:52:45,600 --> 01:52:47,670
What's the matter?

1273
01:52:47,760 --> 01:52:51,355
You have your knife and fork.
You do know how to use them.

1274
01:52:51,480 --> 01:52:55,678
Or have all those carefully-learnt table manners
gone to waste?

1275
01:53:06,320 --> 01:53:08,880
Mitchel can pour you a drink.

1276
01:53:11,880 --> 01:53:13,916
(Mitchel whimpers)

1277
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,594
Your waiter has opted out.

1278
01:53:18,680 --> 01:53:21,513
Er, Grace will pour for you.

1279
01:53:21,600 --> 01:53:23,556
Oh.

1280
01:53:26,600 --> 01:53:28,795
- Non, monsieur!
- Yah!

1281
01:53:46,520 --> 01:53:48,954
Eat, Albert.

1282
01:53:50,240 --> 01:53:52,549
Roy, pour Albert a drink.

1283
01:54:27,920 --> 01:54:32,391
Try the cock, Albert. It's a delicacy.

1284
01:54:33,280 --> 01:54:35,589
And you know where it's been.

1285
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:40,956
(Grunting)

1286
01:55:10,440 --> 01:55:12,556
(Georgina) Go on, Albert.

1287
01:55:13,480 --> 01:55:15,436
Eat.

1288
01:55:32,520 --> 01:55:34,556
Bon appétit.

1289
01:55:36,880 --> 01:55:38,916
It's French.

1290
01:56:04,960 --> 01:56:06,916
Cannibal.
