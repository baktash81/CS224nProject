No, yeah, no, I'm fine.

No, he...

How did you...
How did you find out that that we were...

519
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:26,924
It's standard procedure.

520
00:24:26,998 --> 00:24:29,694
You see, when a previously
registered portfolio shifts over

521
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:32,464
to a domestic partnership filing
in the insurance log,

522
00:24:32,537 --> 00:24:35,370
there's an information sharing system
that notifies us of the adjustment

523
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,771
to make sure
it's not a mistake.

524
00:24:36,842 --> 00:24:39,310
Why do you ask?
Were you keeping your partnership secret?

Hell, no.

Well, Bensley told him what was going on
and he never reported it to the authorities,

663
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:41,067
so he was convicted of obstructing justice
and conspiracy to commit fraud.

What happened to your place?

858
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:49,953
Roaches.

859
00:38:50,628 --> 00:38:52,493
Yeah, big giant roaches.

860
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:53,789
They ate my dog.

861
00:38:53,864 --> 00:38:54,956

862
00:38:55,032 --> 00:38:56,192
Language!

863
00:38:56,267 --> 00:38:58,326
Roaches are so ewwy.

864
00:38:59,203 --> 00:39:01,364
Did you hear that?
Roaches are ewwy.

865
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:04,237
"Ewwy" is another word not allowed said
in this house, okay?

866
00:39:04,308 --> 00:39:05,969
I think ewwy's a nice word.

MAN: The Reds never even came up
in the conversation.

870
00:39:17,088 --> 00:39:20,524
About five straight seasons
losing regular seasons,

871
00:39:20,591 --> 00:39:23,754
the franchise's worse such stretch
since the '50s.

872
00:39:23,828 --> 00:39:27,389
Yet heading into play today, the Reds
were tied for the best record in the bigs.

873
00:39:27,465 --> 00:39:30,457
They've got
everybody going except for...

874
00:39:31,168 --> 00:39:32,567
... who's eligible
to come off the DL,

875
00:39:32,636 --> 00:39:34,797
but hasn't fully recovered
from an inflamed tendon...

876
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:35,998
Real smooth.

877
00:39:36,073 --> 00:39:37,335
Why? What happened?

878
00:39:37,408 --> 00:39:38,602
You broke Tori's chair!

Hey, it's okay, sweetheart.

893
00:40:09,673 --> 00:40:12,506
You see, Uncle Chuck, he's not used
to living in a house with a young lady.

894
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:13,838
True that.
Come here, honey.

'cause he can't get his butt

00:40:23,954 --> 00:40:25,012
in that thing.
Yeah.

00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:27,023
He got his butt stuck
in a king-sized Jacuzzi one time.

I didn't.
Actually, you know what?
Give me that.

How about if I put
Paula's pajamas on?

921

Would that get me
in the sack with you?
