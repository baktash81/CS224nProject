1
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,193
Your son is arrived from London.

2
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,872
- Father...
- John...

3
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:24,477
You will see in my will the estate
of Norland was left to me in a way -

4
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:30,636
- that prevents me from dividing it
between my two families.

5
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:38,593
Norland, in its entirety,
is therefore yours by law.

6
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:44,551
And I am happy for you and Fanny.

7
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:52,672
But your stepmother, my wife and
daughters are left only 500 a year.

8
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,516
Barely enough to live on.
Nothing for the girls' dowries.

9
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:04,273
- You must help them.
- Of course.

10
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:07,796
You must promise to do this.

11
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,229
I promise, Father.
I promise.

12
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,798
Help them? What do you mean?

13
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:25,230
I mean to give them 3,000. The
interest will be an extra income.

14
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:31,953
- The gift will fulfil my promise.
- Without question. More than amply.

15
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:37,956
One had rather, on such occasions,
do too much than too little.

16
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:42,432
Of course, he did not stipulate
a particular sum.

17
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,440
What do you say to 1,500, then?

18
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:52,913
What brother would be so kind to his
real sisters, let alone half-blood?

19
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:58,950
- They can hardly expect more.
- What can you afford?

20
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:08,594
100 a year to their mother is
better than losing 1,500 at once.

21
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:14,596
Should she live longer than 15 years
we'd be completely taken in.

22
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:19,231
People live forever
when an annuity is to be paid them.

23
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:25,436
20 now and then will amply
discharge my promise, you're right.

24
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:31,152
I'm convinced that your father
had no idea of giving them money.

25
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:36,633
- They will have 500 a year.
- What more could they want for?

26
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:42,397
No housekeeping, carriage, horses,
few servants, keeping no company...

27
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,790
How comfortable!

28
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:49,670
They will be much more able
to give you something.

29
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,512
Marianne,
can you play something else?

30
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,037
Mamma has been weeping
since breakfast.

31
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,958
I meant something less mournful.

32
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:37,076
A visitor in my own home!
It is not to be borne, Elinor.

33
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:42,553
- Mamma, we have nowhere to go.
- John and Fanny will be here soon.

34
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,111
Do you expect me to be here
to welcome them? Vultures!

35
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:04,520
I will start making inquiries
for a new house at once.

36
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,958
Until then, we must try
to bear their coming.

37
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:16,592
Margaret, are you there? Come down,
John and Fanny will be here soon.

38
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,996
Why are they to live at Norland?
They have a house in London.

39
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:30,430
Houses go from father to son, not
father to daughter. It is the law.

40
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:37,436
- Come, we'll play with your atlas.
- It's not mine, it's their atlas.

41
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,477
Do sit down.

42
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:54,069
We are looking for a new home, and
can only retain Thomas and Betsy.

43
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,789
We' re sorry
to have to leave you all.

44
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:03,956
But we are certain you will find the
new Mrs. Dashwood a fair mistress.

45
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:09,433
My only real concern is how long
it will take them to move out.

46
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:35,235
- How is Mrs. Ferrars?
- She is always in good health.

47
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:40,110
My brother is with her this season.
Quite the most popular bachelor.

48
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,555
He has his own barouche.

49
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:52,155
- You have two brothers?
- Yes. Edward is the elder.

50
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:56,472
He's travelling up from Plymouth
and will break his journey here.

51
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:06,118
- If that is agreeable to you.
- Dear John...

52
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,397
This is your home now.

53
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:18,068
- Fanny wants the key to the silver.
- What does Fanny want with it?

54
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,870
One can presume she wants
to count it. What are you doing?

55
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:29,639
Gifts for the servants. Where is
Margaret? She's taken to hiding.

56
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:36,239
- At least she can escape Fanny.
- You've not said a word to her.

57
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,757
I have.
I've said yes and no.

58
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,791
Good morning, Fanny.

59
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,878
Good morning, Miss Marianne.

60
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:05,556
How did you find the silver?
Was it all genuine?

61
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:11,238
- When may we expect your brother?
- Edward is due tomorrow.

62
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:18,511
He will not stay long. Will Margaret
give up her room for him?

63
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:24,789
The view is incomparable, and I
want him to see Norland at its best.

64
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:50,237
Mrs. Dashwood,
Miss Dashwood, Miss Marianne.

65
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,631
My brother, Edward Ferrars.

66
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,717
Do sit down.

67
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:05,032
Where is Miss Margaret? I'm
beginning to doubt of her existence.

68
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:10,832
Forgive us, Mr. Ferrars. My youngest
is shy of strangers at present.

69
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:18,315
I am shy of strangers myself,
and I have nothing like her excuse.

70
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,598
How do you like your view,
Mr. Ferrars?

71
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:29,392
Very much. Your stables are handsome
and beautifully kept.

72
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,791
Stables?
Your windows overlook the lake.

73
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:38,990
An error led me to a family room,
but I've rectified the situation.

74
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:43,676
I am happily installed
in the guest quarters.

75
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,513
Tea!

76
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:53,349
They're all spoilt. Miss Margaret is
always up trees and under furniture.

77
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,990
I've barely had a civil word
from Marianne.

78
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:03,474
They've just lost their father.
Their lives will never be the same.

79
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,791
That is no excuse.

80
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,156
Library.

81
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:19,632
- These are mostly foreign.
- Indeed. Magnificent.

82
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,429
I've never liked the smell of books.

83
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:29,152
The dust, perhaps. I hear you have
great plans for the walnut grove.

84
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:34,075
I shall have it knocked down
to make place for a Grecian temple.

85
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:39,633
That does sound interesting.
Would you show me the site?

86
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:51,029
Too expensive, and we do not need
four bedrooms. We can share.

87
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,350
This one, then.

88
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:57,035
We have only 500 a year.

89
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,272
I'll send out more inquiries today.

90
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:10,638
Pardon my intrusion, but I think I
have found what you' re looking for.

91
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:23,678
Won't you come out?
We haven't seen you all day.

92
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:31,758
We'll have to enlarge it. Mattocks
will help you adjust to our hours.

93
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:41,669
Forgive me, do you by any chance
have a reliable atlas?

94
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:46,755
- I believe so.
- I must check the Nile's position.

95
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:51,152
My sister tells me
it is in South America.

96
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:57,793
No!
No, she's quite wrong.

97
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:01,953
I believe it is in Belgium.

98
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:06,033
Surely not.
You must be thinking of the Volga.

99
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:11,274
- The Volga, which starts in...
- In Vladivostok, and ends in...

100
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,319
- Wimbledon.
- Yes, where coffee beans come from.

101
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,950
The source of the Nile
is in Abyssinia.

102
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,636
Is it? Interesting.

103
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:29,432
- How do you do? Edward Ferrars.
- Margaret Dashwood.

104
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,674
It adjoins this property,
and would be a desirable addition.

105
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:40,039
- I'll ride there and speak to...
- Gibson.

106
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:47,117
- He'll be pleased enough to sell.
- He'll want more than it is worth.

107
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,434
Have I hurt you?

108
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:21,316
Thank you.
Forgive me.

109
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:25,157
That was my father's favourite.

110
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:33,558
Thank you for helping Margaret.
She's changed since you came.

111
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,598
I enjoy her company.

112
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:40,799
- Has she shown you the tree house?
- Not yet.

113
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:45,909
Would you do me the honour,
Miss Dashwood?

114
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:50,437
- It is very fine out.
- With pleasure.

115
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:57,160
- Margaret always wanted to travel.
- I know. She's off to China soon.

116
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:03,077
I'm to go as her servant, on the
understanding I'll be badly treated.

117
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:09,509
- What will your duties be?
- Sword fighting and swabbing.

118
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,319
Which will take precedence?

119
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,955
AII I have ever wanted
is the quiet of a private life.

120
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:30,910
But my mother is determined
to see me distinguished.

121
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:37,997
Orator. Politician. Even a barrister
would do, if I drove a barouche.

122
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,993
What do you wish for?

123
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:45,756
I prefer the church, but that is not
smart enough for my mother.

124
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:50,357
She prefers the army,
but that is too smart for me.

125
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:54,274
- Would you stay in London?
- I hate London.

126
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:59,594
Country living is my ideal. A small
parish where I might do some good.

127
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:03,753
Keep chickens...
Give very short sermons.

128
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:12,197
You feel idle and useless.
Imagine how that is compounded -

129
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:17,912
- when one has no choice
of any occupation whatsoever.

130
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:23,119
Our circumstances are therefore
precisely the same.

131
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:26,875
Except that you will inherit
your fortune.

132
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,593
We cannot even earn ours.

133
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:38,357
Perhaps Margaret is right.
Piracy is our only option.

134
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,431
What is swabbing exactly?

135
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:48,318
"No voice divine the storm allayed.
No light propitious shone. "

136
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,759
"When snatched from all effectual
aid, we perished, each alone. "

137
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:59,074
"But I, beneath a rougher sea, and
whelmed in deeper gulfs than he... "

138
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,231
No, Edward.

139
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:05,757
"No voice divine the storm allayed.
No light propitious shone. "

140
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:10,311
"When snatched from all effectual
aid, we perished, each alone. "

141
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:15,235
Can you not feel his despair?
Try again.

142
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:26,349
"No voice divine the storm allayed.
No light propitious shone. "

143
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:31,799
"When snatched from all effectual
aid, we perished, each alone. "

144
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,878
Mamma...

145
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:43,790
Look.
This has just arrived.

146
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:49,159
"I should be pleased to offer you a
home at Barton Cottage, as soon... "

147
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:53,518
- It's from Sir John Middleton.
- Even Elinor must approve the rent.

148
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:57,878
- Has she not yet seen this?
- No. I will fetch her.

149
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:01,032
Wait, let us delay.

150
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:06,991
I believe that Edward and Elinor
have formed an attachment.

151
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:12,075
It would be cruel to take her away
so soon. Devonshire is so far.

152
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:17,598
- Do you disapprove her choice?
- By no means.

153
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:22,390
- Edward is very amiable.
- Amiable? But..?

154
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:27,873
There is something wanting.
He is too sedate. His reading...

155
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:31,271
Elinor has not your feelings.

156
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:37,515
Can he love her? Can the soul
be satisfied with polite affections?

157
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:42,310
To love is to be on fire.
Like Juliet, Guinevere, Heloise.

158
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:47,998
- They made rather pathetic ends.
- Pathetic? To die for love?

159
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,950
- What could be more glorious?
- Your romantic sensibilities...

160
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:06,392
"Is love a fancy or a feeling? No,
it is immortal as immaculate truth. "

161
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:10,519
"'Tis not a blossom shed
when youth drops from life's stem. "

162
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:17,916
"It grows without water, nor ray of
promise cheats the pensive gloom. "

163
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,828
A pity
Edward has no passion for reading.

164
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,996
You asked him to read,
then you made him nervous.

165
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:35,838
Your behaviour is cordial. You
like him in spite of his reading.

166
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:42,872
I think him everything
that is amiable and worthy.

167
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,838
Praise, indeed.

168
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,949
He shall have my devotion when
you tell me he is to be my brother.

169
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:55,398
- What shall I do without you?
- Without me?

170
00:19:55,560 --> 00:20:01,396
I'm sure you will be very happy,
but promise you won't live far away.

171
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:08,318
- There is no question of...
- Do you love him?

172
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:16,349
I do not deny that I think
very highly of him. That I...

173
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:21,835
...greatly esteem him.
I like him.

174
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:29,031
Esteem? Like? Use these words again
and I shall leave the room!

175
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:34,991
Believe my feelings to be stronger.
Further than that, do not believe.

176
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:39,632
Is love a fancy or a feeling?

177
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:43,634
- Or a Ferrars?
- Go to bed.

178
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:49,920
"I do not deny
that I think very highly of him. "

179
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,675
"That I... greatly esteem him. "

180
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:59,110
"That I like him. "

181
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:21,111
We are so happy
that you invited Edward to Norland.

182
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,477
We're all very fond of him.

183
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:30,954
We have great hopes for him.
Mother expects much of him.

184
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:36,956
And in marriage. She's determined
both he and Robert will marry well.

185
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:41,079
But I hope she desires them
to marry for love.

186
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:47,952
The heart doesn't always lead us
in the most suitable direction.

187
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:56,190
Edward is a compassionate person.
Penniless women prey on that type.

188
00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:03,357
Having entered into an understanding
he would never go back on his word.

189
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,717
But it would lead to his ruin.

190
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:12,398
I'm worried. Mother will withdraw
all financial support from him -

191
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:18,556
- should he plant affection in less
exalted ground than he deserves.

192
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:23,674
I understand you perfectly.

193
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,631
Devonshire?

194
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:35,432
My cousin, Sir John Middleton,
has offered us a small house.

195
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,160
He must be a man of property.

196
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:43,394
He's a widower from Barton Park.
It is Barton Cottage he has offered.

197
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:48,315
A cottage? Charming.
A cottage is always very snug.

198
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,393
You will not leave
before the summer?

199
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:57,190
We can no longer trespass
upon your sister's goodwill.

200
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:01,558
- You will come and stay with us.
- I should like that.

201
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,837
Edward has long been expected
by our mother.

202
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:11,348
Come as soon as you can, Edward.
Remember, you' re always welcome.

203
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:41,917
- Can't you take him with you?
- We can't afford him.

204
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:47,712
Perhaps he could make himself useful
in the kitchen... Forgive me.

205
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,994
Miss Dashwood...

206
00:23:55,800 --> 00:24:00,715
Elinor... I must speak to you.

207
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:08,953
There is something of
great importance that I need to...

208
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:15,873
...tell you...
about my education.

209
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:23,109
- Your education?
- Yes.

210
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:29,037
It was conducted,
oddly enough, in Plymouth.

211
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:36,073
- Do you know it?
- Plymouth? No.

212
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,472
I was four years there.

213
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:45,077
In a school run by Mr. Pratt.

214
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:53,469
- Pratt?
- Precisely. Pratt.

215
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,835
While I was there...

216
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,315
That is to say, he had a...
has a...

217
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,389
You' re needed in London
this instant.

218
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:13,476
- I'm leaving this afternoon.
- Mamma wishes you to leave at once.

219
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:19,797
Excuse me.

220
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:52,514
Edward promised
he would bring the atlas to Barton.

221
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:58,715
I'll wager he will do so
in less than a fortnight.

222
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,031
Dear Edward...

223
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,390
Hello there!

224
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,680
Sir John...

225
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:45,511
Dear ladies!
Upon my word! Here you are!

226
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:51,391
- Sir John, your kindness...
- None of that! Hush, please!

227
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:55,235
Here is my dear mamma-in-law,
Mrs. Jennings.

228
00:26:55,400 --> 00:27:01,236
You must be Mrs. Dashwood. Was
your journey tolerable? Poor souls!

229
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:04,631
Why did you not
come up to the park first?

230
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:09,555
- We saw you pass.
- I made John call the carriage.

231
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:14,236
- She would not wait.
- We have so little company.

232
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:19,997
I feel as though I know you already.
Delightful creatures!

233
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:25,917
- You'll dine at Barton Park daily.
- Dear Sir John, we cannot...

234
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:32,633
No refusals! I'm quite deaf to them.
But I insist!

235
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:36,475
Let us settle in.
But thank you very much.

236
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:05,639
Send your man up for the carriage
as soon as you're ready. Goodbye.

237
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:10,635
Don't thank us.

238
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:31,555
Your feet are cold.

239
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:59,598
What have you been doing?
You can grow potatoes in this dirt.

240
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:04,356
It's cold. I'm cold.

241
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:17,711
Where can Brandon be?
I hope he's not lamed his horse.

242
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:22,351
Col. Brandon is the most
eligible bachelor in the county.

243
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:28,516
He is bound to go for one of you.
He's a better age for Miss Dashwood.

244
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:33,310
But I dare say she's left her heart
behind in Sussex.

245
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:38,474
I see you, Miss Marianne! I think
I've unearthed a secret.

246
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,553
You are worse than my best pointer.

247
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:49,756
Is he a butcher, baker, candlestick
maker? I'll winkle it out of you.

248
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:56,155
- She's good at winkling.
- We've none of us any secrets here.

249
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:00,632
Or if we do,
we do not keep them long.

250
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:05,316
- He's curate of the parish.
- Or perhaps a handsome lieutenant.

251
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:10,395
- Give us a clue. Is he in uniform?
- He has no profession.

252
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:13,677
He's a gentleman?

253
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:21,076
- You know there is no such person.
- There is. His name begins with F.

254
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,837
F? A promising letter.

255
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:32,599
Foster?
Forrest? Fotheringay? Featherty?

256
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:36,355
- Fortescue?
- Fondant?

257
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:40,718
Might I play your pianoforte?

258
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:45,156
Yes, of course.

259
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:50,235
- We don't stand on ceremony here.
- Please forgive...

260
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:55,190
I cannot remember when we last
had a song in the house.

261
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:17,276
Brandon! Come and meet
our beautiful new neighbours.

262
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:23,037
What a pity you' re late.
You have not heard our songbird.

263
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,430
A great pity.

264
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:30,310
This is my good friend Col. Brandon.
We served in the East Indies.

265
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:36,510
- Not a better fellow in the world.
- You've been to the East Indies?

266
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:39,956
- What's it like?
- Hot.

267
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:43,908
The air is full of spices.

268
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:50,235
Now, Miss Dashwood,
it's your turn to entertain us.

269
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:54,871
And I believe I know
what key you will sing in.

270
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:58,476
F- major...

271
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:14,591
You have no right to parade
your ignorant assumptions...

272
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:19,311
- You told me.
- I told you nothing.

273
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:23,871
- They'll meet him when he comes.
- You don't speak of such things.

274
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:28,033
- Everyone else was.
- Mrs. Jennings is not "everyone".

275
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:33,115
I like her. She talks about things.
We never talk about things.

276
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:40,755
If you can say nothing appropriate,
limit your remarks to the weather.

277
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:49,152
Surely they have enough reeds
for a Moses basket.

278
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,870
You know what they' re saying?

279
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:34,390
Word is, you've developed a taste
for certain company. And why not?

280
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:39,429
A man like you in his prime...
She'd be a fortunate young lady.

281
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:43,957
Marianne Dashwood would
no more think of me than of you.

282
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:50,070
- Don't think of yourself so meanly.
- And all the better for her.

283
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:19,268
Besotted... An excellent match.

284
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:23,831
- He's rich and she's handsome.
- How long have you known him?

285
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,949
As long as I've been here,
and I came 15 years back.

286
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:34,069
His estate is but four miles hence.
He and John are very thick.

287
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:39,109
He has no wife and children.
He had a tragic history.

288
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:45,910
He loved a ward to the family.
They were not permitted to marry.

289
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:49,595
- On what grounds?
- Eliza was poor.

290
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:54,959
She was flung out of the house,
and he was packed off to the army.

291
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:59,193
I think he'd have done himself harm
if not for John.

292
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:04,229
- What became of the lady?
- She was passed from man to man.

293
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,836
She disappeared from good society.

294
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,879
When Brandon returned from India
he searched and searched, -

295
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:15,157
- only to find her dying
in a poorhouse.

296
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:21,190
I thought my daughter Charlotte
might have cheered him up.

297
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:27,356
Look at him now!
So attentive!

298
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:33,993
- I should try a little experiment.
- Please, let the colonel alone.

299
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:37,630
All suitors need a little help.

300
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:45,715
- We haven't heard you play of late.
- You have a superior musician here.

301
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:53,195
Brandon shares your passion for
music. He plays the pianoforte well.

302
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:59,515
You know as many melancholy tunes
as Miss Marianne.

303
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:04,913
You must play us a duet.
Let us see you both side by side.

304
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:10,154
I do not know any duets.
Forgive me, Colonel.

305
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:21,675
Will we never have peace? The rent
is low, but it comes on hard terms.

306
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:26,516
Mrs. Jennings has nothing to do but
marry off everyone else's daughters.

307
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:29,069
There's a parcel arrived.

308
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:32,232
Look!

309
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:40,795
When is a man safe from such wit,
if infirmity does not protect him?

310
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:44,999
If he is infirm,
then I am at death's door.

311
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:51,793
- He complained of rheumatism.
- "A slight ache" was his phrase.

312
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:59,434
Edward said
he would bring it himself.

313
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:08,316
"It gives me great pleasure to
restore this atlas to its owner. "

314
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:14,350
"Business prevents my delivering it,
which will hurt me more than you. "

315
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:18,957
"Memories of your kindness must
sustain me, and I remain -

316
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:22,271
- your devoted servant,
E.C. Ferrars. "

317
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:28,991
- Why hasn't he come?
- He says he's busy, dear.

318
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:33,915
- He said he'd come. Why hasn't he?
- I'm taking you for a walk.

319
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:38,835
- It is going to rain.
- It is not going to rain.

320
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:45,235
I fear
Mrs. Jennings is a bad influence.

321
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:56,112
- You must miss him, Elinor.
- We are not engaged, Mamma.

322
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:02,910
- But he loves you, dearest.
- I am by no means assured of that.

323
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:09,110
And had he such a preference,
there would certainly be obstacles -

324
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:13,478
- to his marrying a woman of no rank
who cannot afford to buy sugar.

325
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:19,078
- But your heart must tell you...
- It is better to use one's head.

326
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:32,232
- It can't be good for me.
- It is. Stop complaining.

327
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:37,110
- It's giving me a cough.
- It is not giving you a cough.

328
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:41,068
It's lovely. Come on, catch up!

329
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:48,156
- Over there is a field of rabbits.
- I don't want to see rabbits.

330
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:58,074
- Is anything superior to this?
- I told you it would rain.

331
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:02,358
- Blue sky! Let us chase it!
- I'm not supposed to run.

332
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,756
Are you hurt?

333
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:20,031
- I cannot walk. Run and fetch help.
- I will run as fast as I can.

334
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:33,119
Margaret!

335
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:42,875
Don't be afraid. He's quite safe.

336
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:50,833
- Are you hurt?
- Only my ankle.

337
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,869
May I have your permission to
ascertain if there are any breaks?

338
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:16,949
It is not broken.

339
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:20,476
Can you put your arm about my neck?

340
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:26,479
Allow me to escort you home.

341
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:32,110
At last!

342
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:37,400
She fell down and he's carrying her!

343
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:40,552
Marianne, are you hurt?

344
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:44,235
It's a twisted ankle.

345
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:48,234
It's not serious.
I felt the bone, and it's sound.

346
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:53,155
- I cannot begin to thank you.
- Do not think of it.

347
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:57,871
- Will you not be seated?
- I'd leave a water mark.

348
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:04,878
- But permit me to call tomorrow.
- We shall look forward to it.

349
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:08,077
I'll show you out.

350
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:11,437
Margaret, get the gentleman's hat.

351
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:19,032
- His name!
- To whom are we so much obliged?

352
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,556
John Willoughby of Allenham
at your service.

353
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:26,395
John Willoughby of Allenham...

354
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:30,632
What an impressive gentleman!

355
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:35,237
He lifted me as if I weighed no more
than a dried leaf.

356
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:40,269
- Tell me if I hurt you.
- She feels no pain, Mamma.

357
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:44,353
Margaret, ask Betsy to make up
a cold compress.

358
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:47,796
Please don't say anything important.

359
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:53,239
- He expressed himself well.
- With decorum and honour.

360
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:58,679
- And spirit and wit and feeling.
- And economy. Ten words at most.

361
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:02,594
- Change, or you'll catch a cold.
- What care I for colds?

362
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:08,039
- You'll care when your nose swells.
- You're right. Help me.

363
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:15,472
He's worth catching. Marianne must
not have all the men to herself.

364
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:22,079
- But what do you know of him?
- There's not a bolder rider.

365
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:27,030
But what are his tastes,
his passions, his pursuits?

366
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:37,035
- He has a smart little pointer...
- Where is Allenham?

367
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:42,638
Nice little estate three miles east.
He is to inherit it from a relative.

368
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:46,031
Lady Allen is the name.

369
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,879
It's Col. Brandon.
I should go out and keep watch.

370
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:03,636
You're looking out for Willoughby.
You'll not think of Brandon now.

371
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:06,314
Come in.

372
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:10,915
Good morning, Brandon.

373
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:16,552
- How is the invalid?
- Thank you so much, Colonel.

374
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:23,193
Why set your cap at Willoughby when
you've already made such a conquest?

375
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:26,352
I'll not set my cap at anyone.

376
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:31,310
- Lady Allen's nephew?
- He visits, for he's to inherit.

377
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:39,598
He has a pretty estate of his own.
Combe Magna in Somerset.

378
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:45,517
I'd not give him up to a younger
sister for tumbling down hills.

379
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:55,155
The man himself. Come, Brandon.
We know when we are not wanted.

380
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:58,995
Thank you so much for calling.

381
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:03,196
Marianne, the colonel and Sir John
are leaving.

382
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:06,750
Goodbye.
Thank you for the flowers.

383
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:23,156
- How do you do, Colonel?
- How do you do, more like.

384
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:45,550
- Mr. Willoughby, what a pleasure!
- The pleasure is all mine.

385
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:50,748
- Miss Marianne has not caught cold?
- You've found out my name.

386
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:56,358
The area is crawling with my spies.
You cannot venture out to nature...

387
00:45:56,520 --> 00:46:01,196
- So nature must be brought to you.
- How beautiful.

388
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:08,152
- These are not from the hothouse.
- Mine is not the first offering.

389
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:14,919
- They come from an obliging field.
- I always prefer wild flowers.

390
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:19,517
- Would you..?
- Our gratitude is beyond words.

391
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:27,314
I've grieved for this lonely house.
Then I heard it was taken.

392
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:33,476
I felt an interest which nothing can
account for but my present delight.

393
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:36,871
Pray sit, Mr. Willoughby.

394
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:41,033
Who is reading
Shakespeare's sonnets?

395
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:45,990
- Marianne is reading them out.
- And which are your favourites?

396
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:49,232
Mine is 116.

397
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:53,393
"Let me not to the marriage
of true minds admit impediments. "

398
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:57,155
"Love is not love which alters
when it alteration finds, -

399
00:46:57,320 --> 00:47:01,279
- or bends with the remover
to remove... "

400
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:06,036
- How does it continue?
- "No, it is an ever fixed mark... "

401
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:12,150
- "That looks on tempests... "
- Is it "tempests"?

402
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:20,199
It's strange you are reading these.
I carry them with me always.

403
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:32,075
Until tomorrow then...

404
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:39,509
My pocket sonnets are yours.
A talisman against further injury.

405
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:42,148
Goodbye. Thank you.

406
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:53,909
Good work, Marianne. You covered
Shakespeare, Scott, poetry.

407
00:47:54,080 --> 00:48:00,189
When you know his views on romance,
you'll have nothing left to talk of.

408
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:05,957
I suppose I erred against decorum.
I should have talked of the weather.

409
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:10,352
Mr. Willoughby can be in no doubt
of your enthusiasm for him.

410
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:13,398
Should I hide my regard?

411
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:19,430
- No, but we know so little of him.
- Time does not determine intimacy.

412
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:24,390
Seven years is too little for some,
seven days is enough for others.

413
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:29,076
- Or seven hours, in this case.
- I feel I know him already.

414
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:34,314
Had I more shallow feelings, I could
perhaps conceal them as you do.

415
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:39,031
- I'm sorry...
- Don't trouble yourself, Marianne.

416
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:44,872
I do not understand her.

417
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:14,953
Marianne...

418
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:21,594
- Haven't you finished yet?
- No. Patience.

419
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:36,469
You're not going to deny us
beef as well as sugar?

420
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:41,430
- There is nothing under ten pence.
- Do you want us to starve?

421
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:45,479
No.
Just not to eat beef.

422
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:30,678
If my behaviour was improper,
I should be sensible of it.

423
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:36,392
It has caused impertinent remarks.
Do you not doubt your discretion?

424
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:43,834
If Mrs. Jennings' remarks prove
impropriety, we are all offending.

425
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,595
Good morning, Colonel.

426
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:54,275
Miss Dashwood, Miss Marianne,
I come to issue an invitation.

427
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:01,359
A picnic on my estate
at Delaford.

428
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:05,991
If you would care to join us
on Thursday next.

429
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:11,314
Mrs. Jenning's daughter and husband
are travelling up especially.

430
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:16,559
We should be delighted, Colonel.

431
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:21,430
I will, of course, be including
Mr. Willoughby in the party.

432
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:25,593
I should be delighted to join you.

433
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:33,153
Good morning, Miss Dashwood.
Good morning, Colonel.

434
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:36,392
The colonel has invited us
to Delaford.

435
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:42,078
- I hear you have a fine pianoforte.
- A Broadwood Grand.

436
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:47,519
- Then I shall play for you all.
- We shall look forward to it.

437
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:07,235
- Your sister seems very happy.
- She does not hide her emotions.

438
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:12,793
Her romantic prejudices
tend to set propriety at naught.

439
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:18,318
- She is wholly unspoilt.
- Rather too unspoilt.

440
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:23,554
The sooner she is acquainted with
the ways of the world, the better.

441
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:31,990
I knew a lady with the same
sweetness of temper -

442
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:37,598
- who was forced into a
better acquaintance with the world.

443
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:42,311
The result was only
ruination and despair.

444
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:47,478
Do not desire it, Miss Dashwood.

445
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:51,877
Col. Brandon's lawn
is perfect for kite launching.

446
00:52:51,912 --> 00:52:54,355
Col. Brandon's lawn
is perfect for kite launching.

447
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:57,114
Mind the pretty ribbons.

448
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:04,359
Imagine my surprise when Charlotte
and her master appeared with Lucy.

449
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:07,432
The last person I expected to see.

450
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:12,435
She came to join in the fun.
There is no such luxury at home.

451
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:16,149
I'd not seen you for so long.

452
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:20,233
You sly thing! It was the Dashwoods
she wanted to see.

453
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:24,871
I've heard nothing but "Dashwood"
for I don't know how long.

454
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:30,831
What do you think of them? My mother
wrote of little else in her letters.

455
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,993
- Are they not as she described?
- Nothing like.

456
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:38,152
You are quite rude today.

457
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:44,270
He's to be an MP, and he is forced
to make everybody like him.

458
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:50,197
- I said nothing so irrational.
- Mr. Palmer's so droll.

459
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:54,956
Here he comes!
Now you shall see, Charlotte.

460
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:03,913
Hello, Mr. Willoughby!

461
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:08,198
You must meet my daughter Charlotte,
and Mr. Palmer.

462
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:14,959
- And our cousin, Miss Lucy Steele.
- Welcome to our party.

463
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:23,192
May I sit beside you?

464
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:27,399
I've longed to meet you. I've heard
nothing but praise for you.

465
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:34,799
Sir John and Mrs. Jennings are
too excessive in their compliments.

466
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:40,432
The praise came from another source.
One not inclined to exaggeration.

467
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:43,759
What can this be?

468
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:57,270
Is Col. Brandon here?

469
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:08,671
- My horse!
- What's the matter?

470
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:12,753
- I must away to London.
- Impossible!

471
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:18,392
We can't picnic without our host.
Come up to town tomorrow.

472
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:24,829
- Or wait until we return.
- I can't afford to lose one minute.

473
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:29,710
- Forgive me.
- I hope it's nothing serious.

474
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:34,112
Upon my soul,
this is all very unusual.

475
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:42,154
- Frailty, thy name is Brandon.
- Some cannot bear pleasure.

476
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:46,598
You are a wicked pair.
Col. Brandon will be missed.

477
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:53,359
Why? Everyone speaks well of him,
but no one remembers to talk to him.

478
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:57,035
Nonsense. He is highly respected
at Barton Park.

479
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:01,955
- Which is enough censure in itself.
- Really, Willoughby.

480
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:06,830
Come, come, Mr. Impudence.
I know your wicked ways.

481
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:13,394
Reveal your beau. No secrets between
friends. I'll winkle it out of you.

482
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:20,636
I'll have you married to the colonel
by tea, or I'll swallow my bonnet.

483
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:25,476
- As if you could marry him.
- Why should you dislike him?

484
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:31,272
Because he threatened me with rain
when I wanted it fine.

485
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:37,470
He found fault with my high flyer
and will not buy my brown mare.

486
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:40,950
If it will be
of satisfaction to you, -

487
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:45,910
- I believe his character to be, in
all other respects, irreproachable.

488
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:51,438
In return for this acknowledgement,
don't deny me the privilege -

489
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:56,037
- of disliking him
as much as I adore...

490
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:03,395
...this cottage.

491
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:09,669
- I have plans for improvements.
- That, I will never consent to.

492
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:13,913
Not a stone must be added
to its walls.

493
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:19,074
Were I rich enough, I'd rebuild
Combe Magna to this exact image.

494
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:25,554
- With a fire that smokes?
- Especially the fire that smokes.

495
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:30,555
Then I'd be as happy at Combe
as I've been at Barton.

496
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:36,238
But this place has one claim on
my affections none other can share.

497
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:39,597
Promise never to change it.

498
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:51,112
I'm honoured you risk your honour by
seeing me to the gate unaccompanied.

499
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:56,559
- That is what Elinor would say.
- And she would be right.

500
00:57:56,720 --> 00:58:01,999
Miss Marianne, will you grant me
an interview tomorrow... alone?

501
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:06,551
- Willoughby, we are always alone.
- But there is...

502
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:10,759
There is something very particular
I should like to ask you.

503
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:16,677
Of course. I shall ask Mamma
if I may stay behind from church.

504
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:20,832
Thank you.

505
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,549
Until tomorrow, then.

506
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:39,990
Oh, Virtue...

507
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:46,030
Silently and with fear, enter the
hearts of all that hear me this day.

508
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:50,159
Will he kneel down when he asks her?

509
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:53,630
They always kneel down.

510
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:09,517
What is wrong, dearest?

511
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:14,276
Willoughby?
What is the matter?

512
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:19,070
Forgive me...
I am sent...

513
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:24,439
Lady Allen exercised the privilege
of riches upon a dependent cousin.

514
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:30,232
- She is sending me to London.
- This morning?

515
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:35,918
What a disappointment. Your business
won't detain you for long, I hope?

516
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:41,916
You are kind, but I have no idea of
returning immediately to Devonshire.

517
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:47,791
- I am invited only once a year.
- Can you wait for our invitation?

518
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:57,353
My engagements are of such a
nature... I dare not flatter my...

519
00:59:57,520 --> 01:00:02,594
It's folly to linger in this manner.
I will not torment myself further.

520
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:05,638
Willoughby, come back!

521
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:09,952
Ask Betsy to make a cup of tea
for Marianne.

522
01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:15,911
- What is wrong, my love?
- Do not ask me questions.

523
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:25,919
- They must have quarrelled.
- That is unlikely.

524
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:32,320
Perhaps Lady Allen disapproves
of his regard for Marianne.

525
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:37,235
- An excuse to send him away.
- Then why did he not say so?

526
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:41,712
- It's not like him to be secretive.
- What do you suspect?

527
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:48,956
- Why was his manner so guilty?
- You think he's been acting a part?

528
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:53,636
- No. He loves her. I am sure.
- Of course!

529
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:57,634
Has he left her any assurance
of his return?

530
01:00:57,800 --> 01:01:00,394
Ask if he proposed.

531
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:05,554
No! I cannot force a confidence
from Marianne. Neither should you.

532
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:10,555
We must trust her to confide in us
in her own time.

533
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:14,269
There was something underhand
in his manner.

534
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:16,954
You will think the worst of him.

535
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:22,877
I give him the benefit of my
good opinion. He deserves no less.

536
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:25,759
I am very fond of Willoughby.

537
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:29,230
Mamma... Mamma!

538
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:37,029
She would not let me in.

539
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:25,789
- If only this rain would stop.
- If only you would stop.

540
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:30,954
'Twas you took her off my hands,
Mr. Palmer. A good bargain, too.

541
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:36,877
Now I have the whip hand over you,
for you cannot give her back.

542
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:43,794
Marianne, play with us. Looking at
the weather will not bring him back.

543
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:48,033
- She ate nothing at dinner.
- We're all forlorn these days.

544
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:55,958
Dear Miss Dashwood, perhaps now
we might have our... discussion.

545
01:02:56,120 --> 01:03:00,955
- Our discussion?
- I've longed to ask you something.

546
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:07,559
You might think me impertinent.
It is an odd question.

547
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:13,875
If only he'd gone to Combe Magna.
We live but half a mile away.

548
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:19,319
- Five and a half.
- I cannot believe it is that far.

549
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:24,395
- I can't believe it.
- Try.

550
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:31,756
You may ask any manner of question
if that is of any help.

551
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:37,995
Are you acquainted with your
sister-in-law's mother Mrs. Ferrars?

552
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:44,110
Fanny's mother?
No, I have never met her.

553
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:50,628
You must think me strange to ask.
If only I dared tell...

554
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:56,158
If she tells you of the famous
Mr. F, you must pass it on.

555
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:01,959
Will you take a turn with me,
Miss Dashwood?

556
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:10,713
I had no idea you were at all
connected with that family.

557
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:15,112
I am nothing to Mrs. Ferrars
at present.

558
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:22,470
But the time may come when we
may be very intimately connected.

559
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:25,950
What do you mean?

560
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:31,833
Do you have an understanding
with Fanny's brother Robert?

561
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:37,836
The youngest? No.
I have never met him in my life.

562
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:43,279
- With Edward.
- Edward Ferrars?

563
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:49,434
Edward and I have been
secretly engaged these five years.

564
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:55,630
You may well be surprised.

565
01:04:55,800 --> 01:05:02,114
I only mention it because I entirely
trust you to keep our secret.

566
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:06,956
Edward looks on you
quite as his own sister.

567
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:13,233
I am sorry.
Surely we...

568
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:17,393
We surely do not mean
the same Mr. Ferrars.

569
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:23,795
Yes. He was under the tutelage
of my uncle, Mr. Pratt, in Plymouth.

570
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:29,478
- Has he never spoken of it?
- Yes... Yes, I believe he has.

571
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:38,633
I wanted his mother's approval,
but we loved each other so much.

572
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:47,880
You must have seen how capable he is
of making a woman attached to him.

573
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:54,033
I cannot pretend it has not
been hard on both of us.

574
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:59,035
We can scarcely meet
above twice a year.

575
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:11,593
You seem out of sorts.
Are you quite well?

576
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:17,835
- I have not offended you?
- I must know what you are saying.

577
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:24,951
- Promise me you'll not tell a soul.
- Miss Dashwood is quite engrossed.

578
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:28,719
I give you my word.

579
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:34,113
- What has so fascinated you?
- Tell us all!

580
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:41,197
- We were talking of London.
- Do you hear that, Charlotte?

581
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:46,354
- Charlotte and I concocted a plan.
- The best plan in the world!

582
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:50,991
I make for London shortly,
and I invite you, Lucy, -

583
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:55,836
- and both the Misses Dashwood
to join me.

584
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:01,357
Can I go?

585
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:07,231
You will all come to my Chelsea home
and taste of the season's delights.

586
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:10,073
Please, can I go?

587
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:16,952
- Do you not long for it to be so?
- I came here with no other view.

588
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:25,515
- We can't leave our mother.
- She can spare you very well.

589
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:30,390
- Of course she can!
- I could not be more delighted.

590
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:35,759
I will brook no refusal.
Let us strike hands on the bargain.

591
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:42,234
If I don't have you married by
Michaelmas, it will not be my fault.

592
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:53,196
I've never been so grateful.

593
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:58,559
I shall see Willoughby,
and you will see Edward.

594
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:03,840
- Are you asleep?
- With you in the room?

595
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:11,990
You can't feel as calm as you look.
Oh, I will never sleep tonight.

596
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:16,392
What were you and Miss Steele
talking about so long?

597
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:20,439
Nothing of significance.

598
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:42,396
How do you think I like poking about
in that big house without Charlotte?

599
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:49,280
I wrote to Edward, yet I do not know
how much I may see of him.

600
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:54,753
Secrecy is vital.
He'll never be able to call.

601
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:59,596
My only comfort has been
the constancy of his affection.

602
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:04,470
You' re fortunate never to have had
any doubts on that score.

603
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:11,432
I am of a jealous nature. Had he
talked more of one young woman...

604
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:16,390
But he's not given a moment's alarm
on that count.

605
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:21,315
Imagine how glad he'll be
to learn that we are friends.

606
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:30,791
- Have you missed me, Pigeon?
- Very much, ma'am.

607
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:36,478
- Is everything in order?
- I suggest the ordering of coal.

608
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:43,079
There you are, Pooter.
Still alive, I see... Tea, Pigeon.

609
01:09:43,240 --> 01:09:49,509
You do not waste any time.
Give it to Pigeon.

610
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:58,031
Mrs. Jennings says your sister will
buy her wedding clothes in town.

611
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:03,910
John and Fanny are in town.
We should be forced to see them.

612
01:10:12,240 --> 01:10:16,074
I think it was for next door.

613
01:10:16,240 --> 01:10:21,519
Sit down for two seconds.
You're making me nervous.

614
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:40,875
Oh, Elinor, it is Willoughby.

615
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:44,112
Indeed it is.

616
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:52,598
Excuse me, Colonel.

617
01:10:52,760 --> 01:10:55,433
Colonel...

618
01:10:56,840 --> 01:11:01,595
What a pleasure to see you. Have you
been in London all this while?

619
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:05,389
What a pleasure to see you. Have you
been in London all this while?

620
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:10,315
I have heard
reports through town...

621
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:16,191
Tell me once and for all:

622
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:20,672
Is everything resolved between
your sister and Mr. Willoughby?

623
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:29,191
Though neither one has informed me
of their understanding, -

624
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:34,559
- I have no doubt
of their mutual affection.

625
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:38,315
Thank you, Miss Dashwood.

626
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:42,519
To your sister
I wish all imaginable happiness.

627
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:49,631
To Mr. Willoughby, that
he may endeavour to deserve her.

628
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:54,596
What do you mean?

629
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:58,757
Forgive me...

630
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:04,717
Forgive me.

631
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:21,430
- Where is dear Edward, John?
- And who is Edward?

632
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:26,355
My brother.
Mr. Edward Ferrars.

633
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:30,479
Ferrars with an F?

634
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:40,711
Are there any messages?
No message at all? No cards?

635
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:46,034
- You do not ask for your messages.
- No, for I do not expect any.

636
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:50,079
I have
very little acquaintance in town.

637
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:11,238
Not another word about the ham bone.
You and Cartwright sort it out.

638
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:16,793
- No messages.
- Do not fret, my dear.

639
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:21,795
This good weather is keeping
many a sportsman in the country.

640
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:27,114
But the frost will soon
drive them to town. Depend on it.

641
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:30,397
I had not thought of that.

642
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:33,472
And Miss Dashwood
may set her heart at rest, -

643
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:39,158
- for your sister-in-law is inviting
Mr. F to the ball tonight.

644
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:44,192
Do be careful,
the horses have been here.

645
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:49,996
It is beginning to rain also.
Follow me.

646
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:21,315
Mamma!
This is very merry!

647
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:27,549
- Do you spy anyone we know?
- No. Mr. Palmer has a better view.

648
01:14:27,720 --> 01:14:32,475
- Do you see anyone we know?
- Unfortunately not.

649
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:37,998
How can you be such a tease?
There is Mrs. John Dashwood.

650
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:44,710
Come along, my dears.

651
01:14:47,080 --> 01:14:49,878
There you are!

652
01:14:50,040 --> 01:14:54,477
How hot it is...
You are not alone, I trust?

653
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:59,191
John is just gone
to fetch my brother.

654
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:05,390
Your brother! I declare,
this is good news, indeed.

655
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:08,438
I shall faint clean away.

656
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:13,469
Mrs. Jennings, I am pleased
to meet you. My brother-in-law...

657
01:15:13,640 --> 01:15:15,790
Mr. Robert Ferrars.

658
01:15:17,320 --> 01:15:20,630
Miss Dashwood,
Miss Steele, Miss Marianne.

659
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:25,629
My dear ladies, we meet at last.

660
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:31,319
You must be the younger brother.
Is Mr. Edward not here?

661
01:15:31,480 --> 01:15:36,235
- Miss Dashwood was counting on him.
- He is far too busy.

662
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:41,520
There's no special acquaintance here
to make his attendance worthwhile.

663
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:46,993
What are the men about these days?
Are they in hiding?

664
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:54,271
In the absence of your brother
you must dance with Miss Dashwood.

665
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:00,398
It would be my honour.

666
01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:11,828
Perhaps Miss Steele might consider
reserving the allemande?

667
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:54,630
You reside in Devonshire,
Miss Dashwood?

668
01:16:56,960 --> 01:17:00,919
- In a cottage?
- Yes.

669
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:06,949
I am excessively fond of a cottage.

670
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:12,148
If I had any money to spare,
I should build one myself.

671
01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:26,040
Mr. Willoughby...

672
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:29,829
- How do you do, Miss Dashwood?
- Very well.

673
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:34,596
- How is your family?
- We are all extremely well.

674
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:39,277
Thank you for your kind inquiry.

675
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:43,315
Willoughby!

676
01:17:53,680 --> 01:17:56,752
Good God, Willoughby...

677
01:17:58,600 --> 01:18:02,388
Will you not shake hands with me?

678
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:06,348
How do you do, Miss Marianne?

679
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:12,390
What is the matter?
Why have you not come to see me?

680
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:17,076
Were you not in London?
Have you not received my letters?

681
01:18:17,240 --> 01:18:21,916
I had the pleasure of receiving
the information you sent to me.

682
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:28,351
For heaven's sake, Willoughby,
tell me what is wrong.

683
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:34,155
Thank you. I am most obliged.

684
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:38,791
Excuse me, I must rejoin my party.

685
01:18:57,920 --> 01:19:02,630
Go to him.
Force him to come to me instantly.

686
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:06,679
You must come away.

687
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:14,109
- Do you know them?
- Acquaintances from the country.

688
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:25,639
Come away, dearest.

689
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:36,916
I do not understand.
I must speak to him...

690
01:19:37,080 --> 01:19:41,676
My goodness. Come, dear.
You need some air.

691
01:19:53,640 --> 01:19:57,952
Lucy!
We must go.

692
01:19:58,120 --> 01:20:03,114
It would be our pleasure
to escort your young charge home.

693
01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:05,510
How kind.

694
01:20:05,680 --> 01:20:10,674
She actually sent him messages
during the night?

695
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:25,431
- Marianne, please tell me.
- Do not ask me questions.

696
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:32,551
- You have no confidence in me.
- You confide in no one.

697
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:38,953
- I have nothing to tell.
- We neither of us do.

698
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:44,274
I, because I conceal nothing. You,
because you communicate nothing.

699
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:55,633
Lady Charteris ought to limit her
invitation list. It was very warm.

700
01:20:55,800 --> 01:20:58,872
I am glad we left early.

701
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:03,439
There now...

702
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:12,395
Lovers' quarrels are swift to heal.
That letter will do the trick.

703
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:19,079
I must be off. I do hope he doesn't
keep her waiting much longer.

704
01:21:19,240 --> 01:21:21,959
It hurts to see her this way.

705
01:21:24,360 --> 01:21:27,796
What a welcome I had
from Edward's family.

706
01:21:27,960 --> 01:21:34,229
You never said how agreeable
your sister-in-law is. Robert, also.

707
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:39,872
It is fortunate that none of them
knows of your engagement.

708
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:54,918
"Dear Madam, I am at a loss to see
how I might have offended you. "

709
01:21:55,080 --> 01:22:00,518
"If I have given rise to a belief of
more than I meant to express, -

710
01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:04,389
- I regret
not having been more guarded. "

711
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:07,438
"My affections
are engaged elsewhere. "

712
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:13,232
"It is with regret that I return
your letters and the lock of hair. "

713
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:17,996
"I am, et cetera, John Willoughby. "

714
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,798
Dearest...

715
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:32,115
It is better than if your engagement
had carried on before he ended it.

716
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:34,999
We' re not engaged.

717
01:22:35,160 --> 01:22:39,836
I thought he left you
with some kind of understanding.

718
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:46,792
- He's not so unworthy as you think.
- Did he tell you that he loved you?

719
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:55,311
Yes. No... Never absolutely.
It was implied but never declared.

720
01:22:55,480 --> 01:23:00,349
Sometimes I thought it had been,
but it never was. He broke no vow.

721
01:23:00,520 --> 01:23:04,957
He made us all believe he loved you.

722
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:10,752
He did! He loved me as I loved him.

723
01:23:13,640 --> 01:23:18,316
I had to come straight up.
How are you, Miss Marianne?

724
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:23,076
Poor thing, she looks very bad.
No wonder, for it is but too true.

725
01:23:23,240 --> 01:23:26,630
I was told by Miss Morton, -

726
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:31,237
- that he is soon to marry
a Miss Grey with 50,000!

727
01:23:32,200 --> 01:23:37,718
If true, he is a good-for-nothing
who used my young friend ill.

728
01:23:37,880 --> 01:23:42,954
And I wish with all my soul that his
wife might plague all his heart out.

729
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:47,989
He's not the only young man
worth having.

730
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:52,233
With your pretty face
you'll never want for admirers.

731
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:59,955
Better let her have her cry out
and have done with it.

732
01:24:00,120 --> 01:24:04,511
I will go look out something
to tempt her.

733
01:24:04,680 --> 01:24:09,800
- Does she care for olives?
- I cannot tell you.

734
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,833
Apparently, they never were engaged.

735
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:24,278
Miss Grey has 50,000.
Marianne is virtually penniless.

736
01:24:24,440 --> 01:24:29,195
She couldn't expect him to go
through with it. But I feel for her.

737
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:33,433
She will lose her bloom
and end a spinster like Elinor.

738
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:40,392
We might have them to stay for a
few days. We are, after all, family.

739
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:43,757
- And my father...
- My love...

740
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:48,710
I would ask them with all my heart,
but I've already asked Miss Steele.

741
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:52,873
And we cannot deprive Mrs. Jennings
of all her company.

742
01:24:53,040 --> 01:24:56,112
We can invite your sisters
some other year.

743
01:24:56,280 --> 01:25:01,400
Miss Steele will profit more
from your generosity, poor girl.

744
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:04,358
Excellent notion.

745
01:25:08,240 --> 01:25:10,595
Colonel Brandon to see you.

746
01:25:11,240 --> 01:25:18,316
- Thank you so much for coming.
- How is your sister?

747
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:25,318
I must get her home. Palmer can take
us to Cleveland, a day from Barton.

748
01:25:25,480 --> 01:25:33,160
- I'll take you to Barton myself.
- I confess, that is what I hoped.

749
01:25:33,320 --> 01:25:36,915
Marianne suffers cruelly.

750
01:25:37,080 --> 01:25:44,031
What pains me most is how hard
she tries to justify Mr. Willoughby.

751
01:25:47,200 --> 01:25:50,590
Perhaps...

752
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:57,756
May I relate some circumstances
which only a desire to be useful...

753
01:25:57,920 --> 01:26:02,072
You have something to tell me
of Mr. Willoughby?

754
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:14,629
When I quitted Barton last...

755
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:18,475
No, I must go further back.

756
01:26:18,640 --> 01:26:23,236
No doubt...
No doubt...

757
01:26:23,400 --> 01:26:27,837
...Mrs. Jennings has appraised you
of certain events in my past.

758
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:33,996
The sad outcome of my connection
with a young woman named Eliza.

759
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:39,674
What is not commonly known -

760
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:45,631
- is that 20 years ago,
before she died, Eliza bore a child.

761
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:49,759
The father, whoever he was,
abandoned them.

762
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:55,790
As Eliza lay dying, she begged me
to look after the child.

763
01:26:55,960 --> 01:27:01,193
I had failed her in ever other way,
I could not refuse her now.

764
01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:06,354
I placed the child, Beth,
with a family in the country -

765
01:27:06,520 --> 01:27:11,753
- where I knew she would be looked
after. I saw her whenever I could.

766
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:15,196
She grew up so headstrong, -

767
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:21,515
- and, God forgive me,
I allowed her too much freedom.

768
01:27:21,680 --> 01:27:24,877
Almost a year ago she disappeared.

769
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:29,556
I instigated a search, but for
eight months I imagined the worst.

770
01:27:29,720 --> 01:27:35,192
On the day of the Delaford picnic,
I received the first news of her.

771
01:27:36,360 --> 01:27:40,478
She was... with child.

772
01:27:40,640 --> 01:27:46,237
And the blackguard who had left her
with no hint of his whereabouts...

773
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:56,079
Do you mean Willoughby?

774
01:27:57,880 --> 01:28:03,512
Before I could confront him,
Lady Allen had turned him out.

775
01:28:03,680 --> 01:28:08,231
- He fled to London.
- He left without any explanation.

776
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:15,511
He risked losing the estate, and the
money that remained to his debtors.

777
01:28:15,680 --> 01:28:19,719
So he abandoned Marianne -

778
01:28:19,880 --> 01:28:24,237
- for Miss Grey
and her 50,000.

779
01:28:26,480 --> 01:28:29,233
Is Beth still in town?

780
01:28:29,880 --> 01:28:33,919
She has chosen to go to the country
for her confinement.

781
01:28:40,720 --> 01:28:45,396
I would not burden you,
had I not, from my heart, -

782
01:28:45,560 --> 01:28:50,554
- believed it might, in time,
lessen your sister's regrets.

783
01:29:00,080 --> 01:29:05,996
I have described Mr. Willoughby
as the worst of libertines.

784
01:29:06,160 --> 01:29:11,393
But I learned from Lady Allen that
he did mean to propose that day.

785
01:29:11,560 --> 01:29:18,989
I cannot deny that his intentions
towards Marianne were honourable.

786
01:29:20,840 --> 01:29:25,914
I feel certain
that he would have married her.

787
01:29:26,080 --> 01:29:29,959
- Had it not been...
- For the money.

788
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:40,274
- Was I right to tell you?
- Of course.

789
01:29:42,520 --> 01:29:47,071
Whatever his past actions,
whatever his present course, -

790
01:29:47,240 --> 01:29:51,711
- you may be certain
that he loved you.

791
01:29:51,880 --> 01:29:55,190
But not enough.

792
01:29:55,360 --> 01:29:58,397
Not enough...

793
01:30:06,040 --> 01:30:09,589
Here is someone to cheer you up.

794
01:30:12,120 --> 01:30:18,229
How is your dear sister?
Poor thing.

795
01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:23,190
I do not know what I'd do if a man
treated me with so little respect.

796
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:26,830
Are you enjoying your stay
with John and Fanny?

797
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:32,916
I was never so happy in my life.
Your sister-in-law has taken to me.

798
01:30:33,080 --> 01:30:37,870
- You cannot imagine what happened.
- No, I cannot.

799
01:30:38,040 --> 01:30:45,116
Yesterday I was introduced to his
mother. She was more than civil.

800
01:30:45,280 --> 01:30:50,877
I have not yet seen Edward,
but I feel sure to, very soon.

801
01:30:53,720 --> 01:30:58,271
There is a Mr. Edward Ferrars
to see you.

802
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:04,877
Do ask him to come in.

803
01:31:39,200 --> 01:31:44,911
What a pleasure to see you.
You know Miss Steele, of course.

804
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:55,878
- How do you do, Miss Steele?
- I am well, thank you.

805
01:31:57,640 --> 01:32:01,315
Do sit down.

806
01:32:05,720 --> 01:32:11,352
Are you surprised to find me here
and not at your sister's house?

807
01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:17,989
Let me fetch Marianne. She would be
disappointed to miss you.

808
01:32:19,160 --> 01:32:22,835
Edward! I heard your voice.

809
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:29,109
- At last you found us.
- My visit is shamefully overdue.

810
01:32:29,280 --> 01:32:35,071
- You're pale. Are you not well?
- Don't think of me. Elinor is well.

811
01:32:35,240 --> 01:32:41,395
- That is enough for both of us.
- How do you enjoy London?

812
01:32:41,560 --> 01:32:48,193
The sight of you is all the pleasure
it has afforded. Is that not so?

813
01:32:49,800 --> 01:32:54,715
- Why have you not visited before?
- I have been engaged elsewhere.

814
01:32:54,880 --> 01:32:59,431
But what was that when there were
such friends to be met?

815
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:04,310
Perhaps you think young men
never honour their engagements?

816
01:33:04,480 --> 01:33:09,395
Edward is the most incapable of
being selfish of anyone I ever saw.

817
01:33:12,160 --> 01:33:18,599
Edward, will you not sit?
Help me to persuade him.

818
01:33:25,920 --> 01:33:31,040
- Forgive me. I must take my leave.
- You are only just arrived.

819
01:33:31,200 --> 01:33:34,351
I've an urgent commission for Fanny.

820
01:33:34,520 --> 01:33:38,479
Perhaps you might escort me
back to your sister's house.

821
01:33:41,400 --> 01:33:45,075
It would be an honour.

822
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:08,876
- Why did you not urge him to stay?
- He must have had his reasons.

823
01:34:09,040 --> 01:34:15,832
Yes, your coldness. Were I Edward,
I'd assume you didn't care for me.

824
01:34:19,240 --> 01:34:25,679
Marianne looked badly. It makes me
fear that I shall never marry.

825
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:30,516
Nonsense. You will marry far better
than the Dashwood girls.

826
01:34:30,680 --> 01:34:33,797
But I have no dowry.

827
01:34:33,960 --> 01:34:39,353
There are other important qualities
that you have in abundance.

828
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:44,674
It would not surprise me if you
married beyond your expectations.

829
01:34:44,840 --> 01:34:48,674
Oh, I wish that might be so.

830
01:34:48,840 --> 01:34:52,833
There is a young man...

831
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:56,993
Is he of good fortune and breeding?

832
01:34:57,160 --> 01:35:02,678
Of both. But his family
would certainly oppose the match.

833
01:35:02,840 --> 01:35:07,356
They will allow it
as soon as they see you.

834
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:10,239
It is a very great secret.

835
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:15,315
I've told nobody in the world
for fear of discovery.

836
01:35:15,480 --> 01:35:21,555
- I am the soul of discretion.
- If I dared tell...

837
01:35:23,200 --> 01:35:28,354
I can assure you,
I am as silent as the grave.

838
01:35:34,920 --> 01:35:38,754
Viper in my bosom!

839
01:35:41,200 --> 01:35:44,829
Stop this!

840
01:35:59,200 --> 01:36:05,992
What a commotion! Edward Ferrars,
the one I used to joke you about, -

841
01:36:06,160 --> 01:36:11,109
- is engaged these five years
to Lucy Steele.

842
01:36:11,280 --> 01:36:18,709
His mother has demanded he break the
engagement or suffer disinheritance.

843
01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:24,000
But he refuses to break his promise.
He has stood by her, -

844
01:36:24,160 --> 01:36:29,951
- and is cut off without a penny.
She settled it all on Mr. Robert.

845
01:36:30,120 --> 01:36:36,559
I must find Lucy. Your sister-in-law
drove her to hysteria.

846
01:36:38,320 --> 01:36:42,233
How long have you known?

847
01:36:44,360 --> 01:36:49,480
- Since Mrs. Jennings invited us.
- Why did you not tell me?

848
01:36:49,640 --> 01:36:52,712
Lucy told me in confidence.

849
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:56,634
- I could not break my word.
- He loves you!

850
01:36:56,800 --> 01:37:01,828
- He tried to tell me about Lucy.
- He cannot marry her.

851
01:37:03,160 --> 01:37:07,551
Should he treat her worse
than Willoughby treated you?

852
01:37:07,720 --> 01:37:14,034
- He can't marry without love.
- He promised a long time ago.

853
01:37:14,200 --> 01:37:22,437
He may harbour some regret, but he
he will be happy he kept his word.

854
01:37:22,600 --> 01:37:30,598
It is bewitching to think one's
happiness depends on one person, -

855
01:37:30,760 --> 01:37:35,231
- but it is not always possible.
We must accept.

856
01:37:35,400 --> 01:37:40,679
Edward will marry Lucy,
and you and I will go home.

857
01:37:40,840 --> 01:37:43,673
Always resignation and acceptance.

858
01:37:44,440 --> 01:37:47,876
Always prudence and honour and duty.

859
01:37:48,040 --> 01:37:51,396
Elinor, where is your heart?

860
01:37:52,040 --> 01:37:56,352
What do you know of my heart,
or anything but your own suffering?

861
01:37:56,520 --> 01:38:01,469
For weeks this has been pressed
on me, when I could not speak of it.

862
01:38:01,640 --> 01:38:08,352
Forced on me by the person whose
prior claims ruined all my hopes.

863
01:38:08,520 --> 01:38:13,275
I endured her exaltation, knowing
I was divided from Edward forever.

864
01:38:13,440 --> 01:38:18,912
If not bound to silence, I'd have
produced proof of a broken heart.

865
01:38:45,040 --> 01:38:52,230
I have heard your Mr. Ferrars
has lost his fortune to his brother.

866
01:38:52,400 --> 01:38:57,679
- Have I been rightly informed?
- It is indeed so.

867
01:38:57,840 --> 01:39:05,076
- Are you acquainted with him?
- No, we have never met.

868
01:39:05,240 --> 01:39:09,916
But I know only too well
the cruelty...

869
01:39:10,080 --> 01:39:16,076
...of dividing two young people
long attached to one another.

870
01:39:18,680 --> 01:39:24,437
I have a proposal that may allow him
to marry Miss Steele immediately.

871
01:39:24,600 --> 01:39:29,196
As he is a friend to your family,
perhaps you'd mention it to him.

872
01:39:31,480 --> 01:39:37,953
I'm sure he'd be delighted
to hear it from your own lips.

873
01:39:39,520 --> 01:39:42,432
I think not.

874
01:39:42,600 --> 01:39:48,869
His behaviour has proved him proud.
In the best sense.

875
01:39:49,040 --> 01:39:52,919
I feel certain
this is the right course.

876
01:39:59,400 --> 01:40:02,472
Mr. Edward Ferrars.

877
01:40:11,880 --> 01:40:14,872
Thank you for responding so quickly.

878
01:40:15,040 --> 01:40:18,828
I was grateful
to receive your message.

879
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:21,992
God knows what you must think of me.

880
01:40:22,160 --> 01:40:26,950
- I have no right to speak...
- I have good news.

881
01:40:27,120 --> 01:40:29,998
Do please sit down.

882
01:40:34,720 --> 01:40:39,919
- You know of Col. Brandon.
- I've heard his name.

883
01:40:40,080 --> 01:40:45,950
Col. Brandon desires me to say,
as you wish to join the clergy, -

884
01:40:46,120 --> 01:40:51,717
- that he has pleasure in offering
you the parish at Delaford, -

885
01:40:51,880 --> 01:40:56,112
- in the hope it may enable
you and Miss Steele to marry.

886
01:40:57,440 --> 01:41:00,876
- Col. Brandon?
- Yes.

887
01:41:01,040 --> 01:41:07,593
He means it as testimony of his
concern for this cruel situation.

888
01:41:09,080 --> 01:41:12,470
Col. Brandon give me a parish?

889
01:41:13,520 --> 01:41:17,035
Can it be possible?

890
01:41:17,200 --> 01:41:23,594
You shouldn't be astonished to find
friendship outside your family.

891
01:41:23,760 --> 01:41:29,232
No.
Not to find it in you.

892
01:41:29,400 --> 01:41:34,269
I cannot be ignorant that it is
certainly to you that I owe this.

893
01:41:34,440 --> 01:41:38,353
I'd express it if I could,
but I am no orator...

894
01:41:38,520 --> 01:41:44,390
You are mistaken.
You owe it to your own merit.

895
01:41:48,640 --> 01:41:52,838
Col. Brandon must be a man
of great worth.

896
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:57,278
He is the kindest and best of men.

897
01:41:59,240 --> 01:42:04,473
May I ask why the colonel
did not tell me himself?

898
01:42:04,640 --> 01:42:10,112
I think he felt it would be better
coming from a friend.

899
01:42:14,360 --> 01:42:19,593
Your friendship has been
the most important in my life.

900
01:42:22,840 --> 01:42:26,355
You will always have it.

901
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:33,197
Forgive me.

902
01:42:33,360 --> 01:42:38,388
You honour your promises. That is
more important than anything else.

903
01:42:38,560 --> 01:42:42,838
I wish you both happiness.

904
01:43:20,920 --> 01:43:24,879
What luck for them
to find a parish so close to Barton.

905
01:43:25,040 --> 01:43:29,113
You'll all be able to meet
very often.

906
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:33,990
I've never disliked a person so much
as I do Mr. Willoughby.

907
01:43:34,160 --> 01:43:41,350
We can see his house from the hill!
I'll ask Jackson to plant trees.

908
01:43:41,520 --> 01:43:43,556
You won't.

909
01:43:43,720 --> 01:43:48,430
I hear Miss Grey's bridal gown
was everything of the finest...

910
01:43:59,880 --> 01:44:05,512
Mrs. Bunting!
We're in desperate need of tea.

911
01:44:12,640 --> 01:44:17,350
She's not drawn breath since London.
Had I only found another way home.

912
01:44:17,520 --> 01:44:23,789
There was no other way. I'll just
take a stroll. A moment's peace.

913
01:44:23,960 --> 01:44:28,476
- I think it is going to rain.
- No, it will not rain.

914
01:44:28,640 --> 01:44:34,431
- When you say so, it always does.
- I shall keep to the garden.

915
01:44:53,320 --> 01:45:02,194
We are very proud of our Thomas.
His papa has such a way with him.

916
01:45:13,400 --> 01:45:18,713
Oh, there you are.
Come and meet little Thomas.

917
01:45:33,680 --> 01:45:36,990
I cannot see Marianne.

918
01:46:13,680 --> 01:46:20,313
Love is not love which alters
when it alteration finds, -

919
01:46:20,480 --> 01:46:25,634
- or bends with the remover
to remove.

920
01:46:25,800 --> 01:46:30,794
Oh, no, 'tis an ever fixed mark -

921
01:46:30,960 --> 01:46:35,511
- that looks on tempests
and is never shaken.

922
01:46:37,600 --> 01:46:40,512
Willoughby...

923
01:46:41,920 --> 01:46:44,878
Willoughby...

924
01:46:45,040 --> 01:46:47,998
Willoughby...

925
01:46:51,680 --> 01:46:53,671
Marianne?

926
01:46:53,840 --> 01:47:00,279
- She'll be wet through.
- Thank you for pointing that out.

927
01:47:00,440 --> 01:47:04,194
Do not worry, Miss Dashwood.
Brandon will find her.

928
01:47:04,360 --> 01:47:08,990
We can all guess where she went.

929
01:47:36,640 --> 01:47:40,553
She's not hurt,
but we must get her warm.

930
01:47:40,720 --> 01:47:45,635
There is a fire lit in my room.
Do hurry!

931
01:48:12,120 --> 01:48:15,999
I think Marianne may need
a doctor.

932
01:48:34,440 --> 01:48:41,198
You'll wear yourself out. A day or
two in bed will set her to rights.

933
01:48:41,360 --> 01:48:47,549
You can rely upon Harris, Colonel.
I've never found a better physician.

934
01:48:47,720 --> 01:48:54,717
- What is the diagnosis?
- It is an infectious fever.

935
01:48:54,880 --> 01:49:00,716
- I recommend removing your child.
- Mrs. Bunting!

936
01:49:08,520 --> 01:49:13,958
Miss Dashwood...
I am more sorry than I can say.

937
01:49:14,120 --> 01:49:19,672
- If you prefer me to stay I shall.
- That is very kind.

938
01:49:19,840 --> 01:49:23,958
But Col. Brandon and Dr. Harris
will look after us.

939
01:49:24,120 --> 01:49:27,396
Thank you for all you have done.

940
01:49:54,440 --> 01:49:58,752
She's not doing as well
as I would like.

941
01:50:11,720 --> 01:50:14,837
What can I do?

942
01:50:16,200 --> 01:50:22,355
- You've done so much already.
- Anything, or I shall run mad.

943
01:50:22,520 --> 01:50:26,752
She would be easier
if her mother were here.

944
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,992
I must fetch more laudanum.

945
01:51:12,160 --> 01:51:18,633
I cannot pretend that your sister's
condition is not very serious.

946
01:51:22,960 --> 01:51:26,157
You must prepare yourself.

947
01:51:26,320 --> 01:51:29,835
I will return shortly.

948
01:51:45,640 --> 01:51:48,200
Marianne...

949
01:51:48,360 --> 01:51:51,670
Marianne, please try...

950
01:51:53,520 --> 01:51:56,034
Marianne...

951
01:51:58,160 --> 01:52:02,119
Please try...

952
01:52:12,200 --> 01:52:17,433
I cannot...
I cannot do without you.

953
01:52:24,880 --> 01:52:30,318
I've tried to bear everything else.
I will try...

954
01:52:31,480 --> 01:52:35,189
But please, dearest...

955
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,833
...beloved Marianne...

956
01:52:45,400 --> 01:52:49,234
...do not leave me alone.

957
01:53:41,320 --> 01:53:43,709
Elinor...

958
01:54:08,240 --> 01:54:10,231
My mother...

959
01:54:19,320 --> 01:54:23,791
She is out of danger.
She is out of danger.

960
01:54:35,880 --> 01:54:39,031
- Where is Elinor?
- I'm here.

961
01:54:39,200 --> 01:54:42,317
Dearest, I am here.

962
01:54:46,360 --> 01:54:49,716
Col. Brandon...

963
01:54:56,120 --> 01:54:59,874
Thank you.

964
01:55:38,920 --> 01:55:45,234
He's not so dashing as Willoughby,
but he has a pleasing countenance.

965
01:55:45,400 --> 01:55:51,077
There was something in Willoughby's
eyes at times that I did not like.

966
01:55:55,120 --> 01:55:58,669
"Nor is the earth the lesse,
or loseth aught. "

967
01:55:58,840 --> 01:56:06,520
"What from one place doth fall is
with the tide to another brought. "

968
01:56:06,680 --> 01:56:13,028
"For there is nothing lost
but may be found...

969
01:56:13,200 --> 01:56:17,079
...if sought. "

970
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:24,949
- Shall we continue tomorrow?
- No, for I must away.

971
01:56:25,120 --> 01:56:31,150
- Away? Where?
- That I cannot tell you.

972
01:56:31,320 --> 01:56:34,915
It is a secret.

973
01:56:36,960 --> 01:56:40,999
You will not stay away long?

974
01:56:56,480 --> 01:56:59,358
There.

975
01:57:00,400 --> 01:57:05,793
There I fell,
and there I first saw Willoughby.

976
01:57:05,960 --> 01:57:10,795
Poor Willoughby.
He will always regret you.

977
01:57:10,960 --> 01:57:16,353
Does it follow that, had he chosen
me, he would have been content?

978
01:57:16,520 --> 01:57:20,877
He would have had a wife he loved,
but no money, -

979
01:57:21,040 --> 01:57:27,718
- and might have learned to rank
his pocketbook above his heart.

980
01:57:30,560 --> 01:57:35,998
If his regrets are half as painful
as mine, he will suffer enough.

981
01:57:36,160 --> 01:57:41,837
Do you compare
your conduct with his?

982
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:48,189
I compare it to what it
ought to have been. With yours.

983
01:58:00,600 --> 01:58:03,956
I fetched those beef fillets, ma'am.

984
01:58:04,120 --> 01:58:09,990
Beef is less expensive in Exeter.
Anyway, it's for Marianne.

985
01:58:10,160 --> 01:58:13,869
- Was Exeter crowded?
- It was, ma'am.

986
01:58:14,040 --> 01:58:19,512
Miss Pothington
has had another stroke.

987
01:58:19,680 --> 01:58:23,673
And Miss Murden has turned away
Coles for his drunkenness.

988
01:58:23,840 --> 01:58:29,153
And Mr. Ferrars is married,
but of course you know that.

989
01:58:32,080 --> 01:58:34,958
Who told you he was married?

990
01:58:35,120 --> 01:58:42,549
I saw Mrs. Ferrars myself. She and
Mr. Ferrars stopped at the inn.

991
01:58:42,720 --> 01:58:47,111
I saw it was Miss Steele,
so I took off my hat.

992
01:58:47,280 --> 01:58:51,876
She inquired after all of you,
especially Miss Dashwood.

993
01:58:52,040 --> 01:58:59,674
She bade me give their compliments.
They're sending a piece of the cake.

994
01:59:00,880 --> 01:59:06,193
- Did Mrs. Ferrars seem well?
- She said she was vastly contented.

995
01:59:06,360 --> 01:59:11,309
As she was always an affable lady,
I made free to wish her joy.

996
01:59:11,480 --> 01:59:14,677
Thank you, Thomas.

997
01:59:44,440 --> 01:59:48,592
- What is it, Thomas?
- I'm not sure, but it's heavy.

998
01:59:49,280 --> 01:59:54,991
"It is small enough for the parlour.
When I follow shortly, I expect -

999
01:59:55,160 --> 02:00:00,598
- that you've learnt the enclosed.
Your friend, Christopher Brandon. "

1000
02:00:00,760 --> 02:00:04,150
It fits perfectly.

1001
02:00:04,480 --> 02:00:07,517
Here you are, Miss Marianne.

1002
02:00:07,680 --> 02:00:10,319
Fetch some tea.

1003
02:00:10,480 --> 02:00:16,669
- He must like you very much.
- It's for all of us.

1004
02:01:02,480 --> 02:01:05,597
Here is Col. Brandon.

1005
02:01:15,080 --> 02:01:21,679
- I do not think it is the colonel.
- He said he would arrive today.

1006
02:01:22,440 --> 02:01:25,159
Edward!

1007
02:01:25,320 --> 02:01:28,198
It is Edward!

1008
02:01:30,040 --> 02:01:33,635
Calm.
We must be calm.

1009
02:01:53,760 --> 02:01:56,558
Mr. Ferrars for you, ma'am.

1010
02:02:00,320 --> 02:02:04,552
Edward...
What a pleasure to see you.

1011
02:02:20,920 --> 02:02:27,268
- I trust I find you all well?
- Thank you. We are all very well.

1012
02:02:31,840 --> 02:02:36,994
We've been enjoying fine weather...
Well, we have.

1013
02:02:38,240 --> 02:02:44,076
I'm glad to hear it.
The roads were very dry.

1014
02:02:47,680 --> 02:02:53,198
I wish you great joy, Edward.

1015
02:03:09,320 --> 02:03:13,916
I hope
you have left Mrs. Ferrars well.

1016
02:03:15,160 --> 02:03:19,392
Tolerably... Thank you.

1017
02:03:22,920 --> 02:03:27,038
Is Mrs. Ferrars at the new parish?

1018
02:03:27,200 --> 02:03:31,193
No... my mother is in town.

1019
02:03:31,360 --> 02:03:34,875
I meant Mrs. Edward Ferrars.

1020
02:03:38,080 --> 02:03:41,993
You've not heard?

1021
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:47,959
I think you mean my brother.
Mrs. Robert Ferrars.

1022
02:03:50,400 --> 02:03:54,439
- Mrs. Robert Ferrars?
- Yes.

1023
02:03:55,880 --> 02:04:01,750
I received a letter
from Miss Steele, -

1024
02:04:01,920 --> 02:04:08,473
- or Mrs. Ferrars, I should say,
communicating to me -

1025
02:04:08,640 --> 02:04:13,760
- the transfer of her affections
to my brother Robert.

1026
02:04:13,920 --> 02:04:18,311
It seems they were much
thrown together in London.

1027
02:04:18,480 --> 02:04:24,589
In view of my new circumstances
I felt it only right -

1028
02:04:24,760 --> 02:04:29,151
- that she be released
from our engagement.

1029
02:04:29,320 --> 02:04:34,155
At any rate, they were married
last week in Plymouth.

1030
02:04:39,200 --> 02:04:42,237
Then you...

1031
02:04:43,800 --> 02:04:46,837
...are not married?

1032
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:50,709
No.

1033
02:05:15,960 --> 02:05:21,637
Elinor...
I met Lucy when I was very young.

1034
02:05:21,800 --> 02:05:28,114
Had I had a profession, I would not
have felt such an idle inclination.

1035
02:05:28,280 --> 02:05:34,753
At Norland, I convinced myself that
you felt only friendship for me, -

1036
02:05:34,920 --> 02:05:38,754
- and that it was my heart alone
that I was risking.

1037
02:05:38,920 --> 02:05:45,519
I have come with no expectations,
only to express, now I am able, -

1038
02:05:47,040 --> 02:05:52,751
- that my heart is,
and always will be...

1039
02:05:54,440 --> 02:05:57,830
...yours.

1040
02:06:10,360 --> 02:06:16,037
- He's sitting next to her.
- What else?

1041
02:06:16,200 --> 02:06:18,919
Tell us!

1042
02:06:19,080 --> 02:06:22,834
He's kneeling down!
