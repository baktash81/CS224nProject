1
00:00:56,046 --> 00:01:01,111
We are gathered here today to consign
the mortal remains of Millard Frymore.

2
00:01:01,417 --> 00:01:04,487
Or whatever his name really was.

3
00:01:04,794 --> 00:01:07,364
I ain't really got
a whole lot to say about Millard

4
00:01:07,748 --> 00:01:11,086
because he only rode amongst us
two days ago,

5
00:01:11,393 --> 00:01:12,851
and was promptly struck down

6
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:16,688
by whatever deadly disease
it was struck him down.

7
00:01:16,956 --> 00:01:20,294
We can only hope
that whatever deadly disease it was

8
00:01:20,524 --> 00:01:23,287
it wasn't particularly contagious.

9
00:01:23,594 --> 00:01:28,850
And with that in mind, I suggest
we all bow our heads in devout prayer.

10
00:01:29,234 --> 00:01:34,605
Heavenly Father, we hereby consign
to your tender mercies all that remains...

11
00:01:34,874 --> 00:01:36,639
Get out!

12
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:45,463
All that remains of one Millard Frymore.

13
00:01:45,847 --> 00:01:49,070
Origin unknown.
Cause of death unknown.

14
00:01:49,377 --> 00:01:53,290
And of considerable concern to those
of us thrown into contact with him

15
00:01:53,597 --> 00:01:56,974
during the last two days.

16
00:01:57,242 --> 00:02:02,882
Millard was struck down in what
was evidently the prime of his life.

17
00:02:03,266 --> 00:02:05,184
In fact, he was took from us so fast

18
00:02:05,491 --> 00:02:09,788
he never even got a chance
to unpack his suitcase.

19
00:02:10,095 --> 00:02:15,390
However, inasmuch as we were the last
to know poor Millard here on earth,

20
00:02:15,735 --> 00:02:19,380
and in so far as we were all drawn
to this godforsaken country

21
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:21,414
in search of a common goal,

22
00:02:21,721 --> 00:02:23,984
I'm certain you will agree with me...

23
00:02:24,214 --> 00:02:26,401
- Hey, Pa... Pa...
- What is the matter with you?

24
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:29,164
- Take a look.
- Ain't you got no reverence for anything?

25
00:02:29,586 --> 00:02:31,389
- Gold.
- What?

26
00:02:32,655 --> 00:02:34,650
Take a look, it's gold.

27
00:02:34,842 --> 00:02:38,295
I remind everyone we are here to
consign the remains of Millard Frymore.

28
00:02:38,487 --> 00:02:40,597
- It's gold, Henry.
- Gold?

29
00:02:40,789 --> 00:02:42,708
Down there in the grave.

30
00:02:43,859 --> 00:02:47,388
- Let's get this coffin out and have a look.
- Oh, no, you don't!

31
00:02:47,695 --> 00:02:49,537
Get out of my gold mine.

32
00:02:52,491 --> 00:02:54,295
Get out of my gold mine.

33
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:02,083
<i>- We're gonna be rich.
- Get out of my gold mine...</i>

34
00:03:05,421 --> 00:03:08,606
Gold! Gold! Gold!

35
00:05:12,801 --> 00:05:15,986
It doesn't seem possible
that a town could get in this condition

36
00:05:16,254 --> 00:05:18,173
in the short time it's been in existence.

37
00:05:18,403 --> 00:05:19,707
Lynchings, gunfights,

38
00:05:20,014 --> 00:05:23,851
and that drunken revelry going on
at Madame Orr's House 24 hours a day.

39
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:26,613
A decent woman
is not safe on these streets.

40
00:05:26,844 --> 00:05:29,414
Oh, I think the women are safe enough
for the most part.

41
00:05:29,683 --> 00:05:32,867
We only got a couple
that would be much interest to anyone.

42
00:05:33,136 --> 00:05:37,356
Outside the dance-hall girls and they're
good at handling themselves in a pinch.

43
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,275
Or in a ticklish situation.

44
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:43,035
Well, now, this may be very funny
to the members of the town council.

45
00:05:43,418 --> 00:05:47,178
We mine-owners haven't found anything
to laugh at since we started in business.

46
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:49,365
We don't think it's funny, Tom.

47
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:51,667
We just don't know what to do about it.

48
00:05:51,859 --> 00:05:55,504
Maybe what we need is a new mayor
and a town council that does know.

49
00:05:55,773 --> 00:06:00,223
What kinda talk is that? The only reason
I'm mayor and the others councilmen

50
00:06:00,607 --> 00:06:02,295
is nobody else wanted the jobs.

51
00:06:02,525 --> 00:06:04,981
Don't forget, Tom.
We're all mine-owners ourselves.

52
00:06:05,288 --> 00:06:09,508
Do you enjoy giving 20 per cent of
everything you mine to the Danby family?

53
00:06:09,815 --> 00:06:13,537
- Why would we enjoy it?
- All right, let's do something about it.

54
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,107
What? You all know the situation.

55
00:06:16,338 --> 00:06:19,292
Us in Calendar.
There's Galena, where we ship our gold.

56
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:23,704
There's the Danby ranch in between the
two. The road runs through their property.

57
00:06:24,011 --> 00:06:26,390
Then we build the road
around their property.

58
00:06:26,582 --> 00:06:28,769
How? They own that whole valley.

59
00:06:28,999 --> 00:06:32,720
If they don't get their 20 per cent, they
just hold up every stage and take all of it.

60
00:06:33,104 --> 00:06:35,598
All right, but we've got to do something.

61
00:06:35,905 --> 00:06:38,092
Even if it means bringing troops in here.

62
00:06:38,361 --> 00:06:40,202
- Troops?
- Troops?

63
00:06:40,394 --> 00:06:43,463
What troops? From where?
The nearest troops are 500 miles.

64
00:06:43,732 --> 00:06:47,492
- Then we recruit our own.
- We can't recruit enough dishwashers.

65
00:06:47,799 --> 00:06:49,219
How will we recruit troops?

66
00:06:49,487 --> 00:06:53,170
Nobody wants to stop prospecting
long enough to take a bath.

67
00:06:53,554 --> 00:06:57,007
It all happened so fast we ain't had
a chance to get organised yet.

68
00:06:57,161 --> 00:07:01,304
- The Danbys are takin' advantage of it.
- There goes one of 'em now.

69
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,903
- Which one is he?
- Joe.

70
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:10,819
Out of the father and brothers,
he's second toughest.

71
00:07:10,973 --> 00:07:15,117
- They all act like they own the place.
- The way things are now, they do.

72
00:07:15,423 --> 00:07:18,263
It's gonna stay that way
until we find ourselves a sheriff

73
00:07:18,493 --> 00:07:22,867
that doesn't turn tail and run
the minute someone takes a shot at him.

74
00:08:28,322 --> 00:08:30,240
Whiskey.

75
00:08:48,158 --> 00:08:50,076
All right, you all saw it.

76
00:08:51,496 --> 00:08:53,990
And it was a fair fight.

77
00:08:55,256 --> 00:08:58,402
He drew first.
So it was self-defence.

78
00:08:58,632 --> 00:09:00,934
He drew first, sure as anything.

79
00:09:01,203 --> 00:09:03,696
You couldn't call it anything
but self-defence.

80
00:09:03,888 --> 00:09:07,150
It may have been a lot of things,
but self-defence it wasn't.

81
00:09:07,418 --> 00:09:09,912
And he didn't draw first, you did.

82
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:19,043
- What do you mean by that?
- Oh, it's an old trick. You did it pretty well.

83
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,652
Not real well, but pretty well.

84
00:09:21,921 --> 00:09:24,530
You feinted with your left shoulder
gettin' him to go for his gun

85
00:09:24,683 --> 00:09:27,292
while you were going for yours
with your right hand.

86
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:32,549
It's an old Arizona trick, but I have
seen it used as far north as Montana.

87
00:09:32,932 --> 00:09:36,117
- Are you callin' me a liar?
- You heard every word I said.

88
00:09:36,386 --> 00:09:41,949
All I said was you feinted him into drawing
while you were going for your gun.

89
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:45,325
- So what?
- You beat that poor man to the draw.

90
00:09:45,632 --> 00:09:48,663
He's dead and you're alive.
That's the whole idea of the game.

91
00:09:48,893 --> 00:09:52,039
- What's your name?
- Jason McCullough.

92
00:09:52,346 --> 00:09:54,533
- What's yours?
- Joe Danby.

93
00:09:54,725 --> 00:09:57,718
- And you had better remember it.
- Oh, I'll remember it, Joe.

94
00:09:57,871 --> 00:10:01,248
It's about all I'll do the rest of my life,
remember your name.

95
00:10:33,016 --> 00:10:34,934
The bread's on the table in front of you.

96
00:10:35,203 --> 00:10:37,236
<i>Why, you!</i>

97
00:10:40,191 --> 00:10:42,761
Is this one of Emma's
tasty home-cooked meals?

98
00:10:42,991 --> 00:10:46,982
- That's it, mister.
- They charge $3 for this, huh?

99
00:10:48,363 --> 00:10:54,885
That's what they call inflation. Sometimes
it catches you right in between mouthfuls.

100
00:10:55,806 --> 00:10:58,799
Is there really any gold in this town?

101
00:11:01,485 --> 00:11:04,362
- How long did it take you to get that?
- Yesterday afternoon.

102
00:11:04,746 --> 00:11:06,856
A good part of this morning.

103
00:11:08,199 --> 00:11:10,693
Where could a man find a place to sleep?

104
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,606
If you mean a room, you can't. Down
at the end of the street, you get a cot.

105
00:11:14,913 --> 00:11:17,791
- How much?
- $20. Eight-hour shift.

106
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:24,198
Say a man was willing to go to work to
get himself a stake. How'd he go about it?

107
00:11:24,505 --> 00:11:27,958
- You don't want a job?
- No.

108
00:11:28,342 --> 00:11:32,946
I figure the way prices are around here,
I'll go broke about 2.30 this afternoon.

109
00:11:33,253 --> 00:11:36,783
We got a bulletin board with that
kinda stuff down at the assay office.

110
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:38,893
<i>Thank you.</i>

111
00:11:42,154 --> 00:11:43,689
Hold it! Hold it!

112
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,595
OK, go ahead.

113
00:11:53,473 --> 00:11:54,815
Fight!

114
00:12:46,995 --> 00:12:48,837
Yee-hah!

115
00:12:59,733 --> 00:13:02,419
- Get the hell out of my way.
- Heck, go around.

116
00:13:02,726 --> 00:13:04,721
I told you get outta there.

117
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:09,632
<i>What did I tell you?</i>

118
00:14:30,395 --> 00:14:32,045
Watch where you're grabbing.

119
00:14:46,241 --> 00:14:48,543
- What about you?
- What about me?

120
00:14:48,697 --> 00:14:52,457
- You wanna grab something?
- Everything looks too slippery.

121
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:55,910
- What does that mean?
- Nothing.

122
00:14:56,217 --> 00:14:58,404
You look too clean to suit me.

123
00:15:16,935 --> 00:15:18,738
Are you the man I talk to about...

124
00:15:19,007 --> 00:15:21,424
- Wait your turn, mister.
... the job of sheriff?

125
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:26,604
- You interested in the job of sheriff?
- Well, maybe.

126
00:15:26,796 --> 00:15:30,747
- How much does it pay?
- No sheriff lived long enough to find out.

127
00:15:32,436 --> 00:15:36,196
Look, boys. Why don't you go outside
and watch the fight? The ladies too.

128
00:15:36,503 --> 00:15:39,572
Very good fight out there.
You can watch it too, Sam.

129
00:15:39,841 --> 00:15:42,910
OK, come on.
Let's get out. Get moving. Come on.

130
00:15:43,179 --> 00:15:46,939
All right, let's go.
I'm Olly Perkins, the mayor here.

131
00:15:47,322 --> 00:15:48,473
Jason McCullough.

132
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:50,699
Fred Johnson,
Henry Jackson, Tom Devery.

133
00:15:50,852 --> 00:15:54,152
Original settlers. Fred and Henry
are members of the town council.

134
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,837
- I represent the mine-owners.
- Nice to meet you.

135
00:15:56,991 --> 00:15:59,792
What that fella said a minute ago
ain't strictly true.

136
00:15:59,983 --> 00:16:03,360
We've had three sheriffs the past
two months, but only two got killed.

137
00:16:03,628 --> 00:16:06,813
- What about the other one?
- He quit, kinda sudden like.

138
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,767
I don't think
he had the right temperament.

139
00:16:10,151 --> 00:16:12,261
You never have said
anything about the pay.

140
00:16:12,568 --> 00:16:16,290
Well, for the right kinda man,
$150 a month.

141
00:16:16,481 --> 00:16:18,707
With the spiralling prices around here,

142
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:21,930
that'd only allow a man to eat
and sleep about eight days a month.

143
00:16:22,313 --> 00:16:26,342
- The job includes room and board.
- Not at Emma's Tasty Food Emporium?

144
00:16:26,649 --> 00:16:29,450
At my house.
My daughter does the cooking.

145
00:16:29,718 --> 00:16:34,131
Gentlemen, it's only fair to tell you I'd only
be interested on a temporary basis.

146
00:16:34,437 --> 00:16:35,665
Oh?

147
00:16:35,934 --> 00:16:38,811
I was on my way to Australia
when I heard about your gold strike

148
00:16:39,118 --> 00:16:42,763
and I decided to travel through here
to see if I could pick up a little stake.

149
00:16:43,032 --> 00:16:46,984
- What do you want to go to Australia for?
- It's the last frontier country.

150
00:16:47,252 --> 00:16:51,971
- I thought I might do a bit of pioneering.
- I thought we was pioneers.

151
00:16:52,355 --> 00:16:54,849
- So did I.
- To get back to the sheriff's job.

152
00:16:55,118 --> 00:17:00,988
If I take it, it's with the understanding I get
time off to do the prospecting I came for.

153
00:17:01,371 --> 00:17:05,016
Well, you ain't said nothing yet
about your qualifications for the job.

154
00:17:05,323 --> 00:17:08,201
Don't worry about that.
If I take it, you'll be glad.

155
00:17:08,354 --> 00:17:13,841
It ain't just a question of taking the job, it's
also a question of being able to handle it.

156
00:17:14,225 --> 00:17:16,527
Olly, we ain't in much of a position
to be choosy.

157
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:20,171
Him talking about it at all
certainly shows the right attitude.

158
00:17:20,478 --> 00:17:24,315
I don't care what it shows. As mayor,
it's my responsibility to hire us a sheriff

159
00:17:24,507 --> 00:17:27,653
that's not only got qualifications
but ain't gonna get killed

160
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:30,531
the first time he sticks
his nose out of the door.

161
00:17:47,527 --> 00:17:49,791
There you go.

162
00:17:50,021 --> 00:17:53,935
- What's your point?
- Just an exhibition of marksmanship.

163
00:17:54,242 --> 00:17:57,772
- The bullet went through the hole.
- Maybe it did, maybe it didn't.

164
00:17:58,155 --> 00:18:01,915
- Oh, it did. Take my word for it.
- I'd like to take your word but...

165
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:11,852
Would you mind doing it again,
Mr McCullough?

166
00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:14,461
- You want me to do it again?
- If you don't mind.

167
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:18,106
- Well, I already shot one hole in your roof.
- That's all right.

168
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:33,568
I hope you didn't take offence
at nothing I said earlier, sir.

169
00:18:33,837 --> 00:18:37,674
No. Gentlemen,
just to keep the record straight, now.

170
00:18:37,981 --> 00:18:40,359
$150 a month
and the room and board is fine.

171
00:18:40,628 --> 00:18:44,119
But I've got to do my prospecting.
I'm on my way to Australia.

172
00:18:44,388 --> 00:18:49,491
You just name your terms, mister.
We'll rush to meet 'em.

173
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:52,330
Fine, as long as everything is straight.

174
00:18:52,637 --> 00:18:54,939
Is there some kind of badge with this job?

175
00:18:55,246 --> 00:18:57,049
Oh, you bet there is.

176
00:19:01,462 --> 00:19:05,682
- I'm afraid it's a little bent up.
- That saved the life of whoever wore it.

177
00:19:05,874 --> 00:19:10,593
It would have if it wasn't for all them
other bullets flyin' in from everywhere.

178
00:19:13,739 --> 00:19:15,351
Gentlemen.

179
00:19:15,658 --> 00:19:18,036
- Do we have a jail here?
- Do we have a jail?

180
00:19:18,267 --> 00:19:22,947
A brand-new one with two cells that
the whole community built last month.

181
00:19:23,254 --> 00:19:26,592
Even the dance-hall girls showed up,
made sandwiches and carried on.

182
00:19:26,784 --> 00:19:29,393
It was designed
to be practically escape-proof.

183
00:19:29,662 --> 00:19:32,616
Good, because I'm gonna have
to throw a couple of people in it.

184
00:19:32,846 --> 00:19:37,834
- There's one thing. It's got everything.
- Even a new stove with a coffee pot.

185
00:19:38,102 --> 00:19:41,440
The only thing it hasn't got
is iron bars for the cells.

186
00:19:41,824 --> 00:19:42,975
You're kiddin'.

187
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:46,351
We had to send away for 'em
and they ain't arrove yet.

188
00:19:46,658 --> 00:19:50,380
It's got glass windows and brooms
and kerosene lamps. You name it.

189
00:19:50,649 --> 00:19:52,874
- Just no bars for the cells.
- Right.

190
00:19:54,792 --> 00:19:59,703
- Well, all right, I'll think of something.
- You ain't wanted for anything anywhere?

191
00:19:59,972 --> 00:20:03,732
Not that it matters. We understand
how them little things can happen.

192
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:07,377
No, I'm not wanted for anything anywhere.

193
00:20:13,401 --> 00:20:16,470
You realise the chance you was taking
asking him that?

194
00:20:16,854 --> 00:20:18,657
He might have took offence.

195
00:20:18,772 --> 00:20:24,143
I'm the mayor and I got responsibilities.
The question had to be asked.

196
00:20:38,339 --> 00:20:41,792
Mr Mayor, if I could get
a few men on this pump over here,

197
00:20:41,984 --> 00:20:43,519
I think we could stop this thing.

198
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:46,972
Sure thing, Sheriff. Give us a hand, men.

199
00:20:55,605 --> 00:20:57,638
All right, men. Let her go.

200
00:21:00,209 --> 00:21:02,127
A little more.

201
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:27,335
Break it up.

202
00:21:29,867 --> 00:21:31,555
OK, cut it.

203
00:21:35,507 --> 00:21:38,001
- What are you tryin' to do?
- Stoppin' a fight.

204
00:21:38,193 --> 00:21:40,763
- Who are you?
- I'm the new sheriff.

205
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:43,449
Oh, we got a new sheriff.

206
00:21:45,367 --> 00:21:48,936
Let's see if he scares
as easy as the last sheriff.

207
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:59,678
I want all you people to quit disturbing
the peace and clean up this mess.

208
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:01,712
Yes, sir. Anything else?

209
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:04,398
- You got a name?
- Jake.

210
00:22:04,551 --> 00:22:07,927
Right, Jake, I want you
to go into the Mint Saloon.

211
00:22:08,234 --> 00:22:10,613
There's a fella in there
by the name of Joe Danby.

212
00:22:10,805 --> 00:22:13,759
Tell him I remember his name.
He's under arrest for murder.

213
00:22:13,989 --> 00:22:16,445
I'll be in to pick him up in not 20 minutes.

214
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:18,670
- You talkin' to me?
- You hard of hearing?

215
00:22:18,977 --> 00:22:23,198
You want me to tell Joe Danby
that he's under arrest for murder?

216
00:22:23,351 --> 00:22:26,651
- What about after he kills me?
- I'll arrest him for both murders.

217
00:22:27,034 --> 00:22:30,372
- Where's the jail?
- Just follow me, Sheriff.

218
00:22:43,226 --> 00:22:45,604
You won't find a better jail
for 200 miles.

219
00:22:45,834 --> 00:22:47,638
That is, if he can find one at all.

220
00:22:49,057 --> 00:22:53,009
- Everything seems to be in order.
- Our last sheriff was a good organiser.

221
00:22:53,393 --> 00:22:56,577
Yellow clear through,
but a good organiser.

222
00:23:11,694 --> 00:23:14,610
We should be getting the bars in
any day now.

223
00:24:09,629 --> 00:24:13,581
- That oughta do it.
- That oughta do what, Sheriff?

224
00:24:13,773 --> 00:24:17,801
That oughta take care of it
till we get the bars in.

225
00:24:22,022 --> 00:24:24,823
I've got my bedroll and other things
over at the stable.

226
00:24:24,976 --> 00:24:27,662
I'll pick them up, then settle in
where I'm gonna stay.

227
00:24:27,969 --> 00:24:30,347
I got a nice room for you at my house.

228
00:24:30,654 --> 00:24:33,532
Shall we go over there?
Then I can pick up that Danby fella.

229
00:24:33,724 --> 00:24:36,601
There is something you better know
about the Danbys.

230
00:24:36,793 --> 00:24:39,402
Why bother the sheriff
about that stuff now?

231
00:24:39,671 --> 00:24:43,891
- But, Fred...
- We can fill him in after he settles in.

232
00:24:44,275 --> 00:24:47,920
- You comin', Mayor?
- I'll be right with you, Sheriff.

233
00:24:49,148 --> 00:24:51,181
This is like murder.
I hope you know that.

234
00:24:51,373 --> 00:24:55,133
Just cos we've lost three sheriffs
don't mean we're gonna lose four.

235
00:24:55,517 --> 00:24:59,430
- Our luck is bound to change.
- What about his luck?

236
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:39,025
Prudy! Prudy!

237
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,977
- Just put your things over there.
- All righty.

238
00:25:43,169 --> 00:25:44,627
Prudy!

239
00:25:44,895 --> 00:25:48,924
I want you to meet my daughter, Sheriff.
A good cook. Mighty fine-lookin' girl.

240
00:25:49,308 --> 00:25:51,418
Takes after her dear, departed mother.

241
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:54,372
- Mother died, huh?
- No, she just departed.

242
00:25:54,602 --> 00:25:57,749
Come on, Sheriff.
I'll show you the parlour.

243
00:25:58,516 --> 00:26:01,393
That little organ,
that came all the way from Düsseldorf.

244
00:26:01,585 --> 00:26:04,348
The furniture was shipped
through St Louis and Chicago.

245
00:26:04,655 --> 00:26:07,724
- This desk is where I do my mayor work.
- Very nice.

246
00:26:07,916 --> 00:26:11,369
I guess you could say
this is about the finest house in town.

247
00:26:11,638 --> 00:26:16,242
Let me show you the dining room.
That's where you'll be having your meals.

248
00:26:17,316 --> 00:26:20,002
Prudy! I want you to meet someone.

249
00:26:20,309 --> 00:26:23,148
- This is the dining room.
- You sure have a nice place here.

250
00:26:23,531 --> 00:26:25,066
Thank you, Sheriff. A drink?

251
00:26:25,296 --> 00:26:27,752
- Water, if you have some.
- Water?

252
00:26:28,059 --> 00:26:30,745
Sure thing.
We've got a pump inside the kitchen.

253
00:26:30,936 --> 00:26:32,356
Inside the house?

254
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:39,262
<i>There's the pump.</i>

255
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:11,414
Sheriff.

256
00:27:11,606 --> 00:27:13,716
Before you go down
to arrest Joe Danby,

257
00:27:13,908 --> 00:27:15,826
a couple of things you oughta know.

258
00:27:16,018 --> 00:27:18,320
- All right.
- The Danbys, there's four of them.

259
00:27:18,627 --> 00:27:21,850
Father and three sons,
all of 'em pretty tough customers.

260
00:27:22,157 --> 00:27:23,999
- Outlaws?
- No, not exactly.

261
00:27:24,075 --> 00:27:27,528
But in many ways,
you might say they're like outlaws.

262
00:27:27,835 --> 00:27:30,981
- How's that?
- They do pretty much as they like.

263
00:27:31,288 --> 00:27:34,358
And they get real nasty
when anybody tries to stop 'em.

264
00:27:34,626 --> 00:27:35,893
You mean...

265
00:27:36,046 --> 00:27:38,732
You mean you don't want me
to arrest this boy?

266
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:43,950
No, not at all. It's just it's a new idea.
Takes a little bit of getting used to.

267
00:27:44,333 --> 00:27:48,707
I stood there in that saloon and watched
him gun a man down in cold blood.

268
00:27:49,014 --> 00:27:52,928
Oh, I believe you, Sheriff. It's just
the kind of thing you'd expect Joe to do.

269
00:27:53,311 --> 00:27:56,496
- But are you sure it wasn't self-defence?
- Not a chance.

270
00:27:56,688 --> 00:27:59,297
Sometimes them things happen so fast.

271
00:27:59,565 --> 00:28:01,982
It didn't happen all that fast.

272
00:28:03,402 --> 00:28:05,512
Look, Mr Perkins.

273
00:28:05,819 --> 00:28:10,960
You're the mayor of this town. If you order
me not to arrest this man, you're the boss.

274
00:28:11,267 --> 00:28:15,680
I'll have to give you this badge back,
cos that is no way to run a town, Mayor.

275
00:28:15,948 --> 00:28:18,097
I couldn't agree with you more.

276
00:28:18,365 --> 00:28:22,854
Furthermore, I'll expect all the law-abiding
citizens to back me up in this job.

277
00:28:23,353 --> 00:28:27,458
They will, Sheriff. Well, maybe
not all of them. Not right at first.

278
00:28:27,689 --> 00:28:31,027
You see, it's like I told you.
I'm just on my way to Australia.

279
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:33,520
You go ahead
and do what you think is best.

280
00:28:33,827 --> 00:28:38,316
I'd better go and alert everybody...
We're all behind you, Sheriff.

281
00:28:38,585 --> 00:28:42,345
Don't give it another thought.
You don't need any help with Joe Danby?

282
00:28:42,652 --> 00:28:45,491
- No, I can handle it.
- Oh, good. Good.

283
00:29:02,488 --> 00:29:05,557
- You're the strangest girl I ever met.
- Go away.

284
00:29:05,826 --> 00:29:11,965
Do you always show this side of your
nature or am I just lucky on my first day?

285
00:29:12,272 --> 00:29:15,917
I suppose you have some reason
for sitting up there like that?

286
00:29:16,185 --> 00:29:18,794
Ordinarily, a girl doesn't get undressed,

287
00:29:18,986 --> 00:29:21,557
pour a bucket of water over her head,
then climb a tree.

288
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:23,705
I'm warnin' you...

289
00:29:25,623 --> 00:29:29,345
- Hi, Mrs Danvers.
- What in the world...?

290
00:29:29,729 --> 00:29:32,415
Prudy, is this man bothering you?

291
00:29:32,606 --> 00:29:34,832
- Do you know this young lady?
- Of course.

292
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,594
That's Prudy Perkins.
She lives here in this house.

293
00:29:37,786 --> 00:29:41,738
Does she have any past history
of strange behaviour like this?

294
00:29:42,006 --> 00:29:47,109
Why, no. Prudy's always been
a sweet, normal, loveable...

295
00:29:47,378 --> 00:29:50,332
Of course,
there were a couple of times last year.

296
00:29:50,639 --> 00:29:52,481
What happened last year?

297
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:54,553
It wasn't really anything.

298
00:29:54,668 --> 00:30:00,423
The annual town picnic, she got
her hair caught in the ice-cream freezer.

299
00:30:05,027 --> 00:30:11,549
I think we ought to be merciful and forget
about this whole unfortunate incident.

300
00:30:13,276 --> 00:30:15,271
Good day, ma'am.

301
00:30:24,863 --> 00:30:28,316
Sheriff, I didn't go down there
and tell Joe like you asked.

302
00:30:28,623 --> 00:30:32,076
- Why not?
- Nobody's paying me to take chances.

303
00:30:32,268 --> 00:30:34,455
You never know
how that Joe is gonna react.

304
00:30:34,838 --> 00:30:36,603
Why should you worry what Joe thinks?

305
00:30:36,757 --> 00:30:41,668
Cos he's mean, Sheriff, and he's nasty.
He enjoys killin' people.

306
00:30:42,128 --> 00:30:45,965
- All them Danbys enjoy things like that.
- You're faster than Joe.

307
00:30:46,195 --> 00:30:48,651
- Who says so?
- I do. I've seen you both draw.

308
00:30:48,958 --> 00:30:50,684
You're faster than he is.

309
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:54,406
Supposing it's true,
why should the matter ever come up?

310
00:30:54,713 --> 00:30:56,631
Jake...

311
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:02,386
How would you like the job as my deputy?

312
00:31:02,578 --> 00:31:06,798
I'd hate it.
Even if I lived through it, I'd hate it.

313
00:31:07,182 --> 00:31:12,438
I don't know how much they're paying you
but you gotta believe me, it ain't enough.

314
00:31:12,822 --> 00:31:18,424
He's expecting you. Some of these
other people told him you was coming.

315
00:31:40,178 --> 00:31:42,672
I hear you're gonna try and arrest me.

316
00:31:42,979 --> 00:31:46,317
You don't look near as tough
as those other sheriffs we've had lately.

317
00:31:46,586 --> 00:31:51,497
Particularly that old boy who done run off
an hour and a half after he took the job.

318
00:31:51,804 --> 00:31:55,794
Joe, you just make me feel tired all over
when you talk like that.

319
00:31:56,101 --> 00:31:57,942
Now, what do you mean by that?

320
00:31:58,096 --> 00:32:00,014
It's bad enough to have to kill a man

321
00:32:00,321 --> 00:32:04,733
without having to listen
to a whole lot of stupid talk from him first.

322
00:32:05,002 --> 00:32:08,071
And remember, Joe, I've seen you draw.

323
00:32:09,529 --> 00:32:13,750
All right, Sheriff, hold it.
Now, drop your gun belt.

324
00:32:31,974 --> 00:32:36,770
- I couldn't let him shoot you in the back.
- Oh, you could have.

325
00:32:39,072 --> 00:32:43,600
Is this the kind of town you people
want for yourselves, this kind of life?

326
00:32:43,868 --> 00:32:48,357
Three killings in one saloon alone
and the sun hasn't even gone down yet.

327
00:32:48,664 --> 00:32:51,618
Any more of this foolishness,
I'll close this place up tight.

328
00:32:51,925 --> 00:32:57,872
- Yes, sir. I wouldn't blame you a bit, sir.
- Pick it up, Joe. Go on, pick it up.

329
00:33:02,553 --> 00:33:04,203
I'm gonna get you for this, Jake.

330
00:33:04,395 --> 00:33:07,771
You are the toughest-talkin' blowhard
I ever heard.

331
00:33:08,155 --> 00:33:12,951
You might as well come on. Whether you
like it or not, we're on the same side now.

332
00:33:13,219 --> 00:33:14,946
Come on, Joe.

333
00:33:15,214 --> 00:33:21,276
Take it easy, boys. Me and the sheriff
takes a dim view of show-offs with guns.

334
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:30,216
Remember.
No more shooting till the sun goes down.

335
00:33:30,408 --> 00:33:32,403
- Is that what he said?
- Close enough.

336
00:33:32,595 --> 00:33:34,782
Drinks are on the house.

337
00:33:39,386 --> 00:33:43,913
Jake, why don't you look around the desk
and see if you can find a deputy's badge?

338
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:46,407
I never said I was taking no job
as a deputy.

339
00:33:46,676 --> 00:33:48,901
You're tryin' to corner me into this.

340
00:33:49,093 --> 00:33:51,395
I'm surprised
at what's happening to me too.

341
00:33:51,587 --> 00:33:55,500
I was just ridin' through on my way
to Australia... Where are you going?

342
00:33:55,884 --> 00:33:58,992
- This is just plain stupid.
- Are you callin' the sheriff stupid?

343
00:33:59,337 --> 00:34:01,639
Do I have to listen to him?
He's the town character.

344
00:34:01,869 --> 00:34:03,788
<i>Was the town character!</i>

345
00:34:03,864 --> 00:34:09,236
I'm now deputy sheriff and probably
the second fastest gun around here.

346
00:34:09,619 --> 00:34:11,461
- Did you hear that?
- He probably is.

347
00:34:11,615 --> 00:34:16,449
If he isn't, he will be after I have a chance
to work with him for a couple of days.

348
00:34:16,833 --> 00:34:18,636
Come on, Joe.

349
00:34:21,437 --> 00:34:25,926
Joe, the cell on the right here is yours.
We don't have any bars yet.

350
00:34:26,194 --> 00:34:28,113
- You're kiddin'.
- That's what I said.

351
00:34:28,343 --> 00:34:31,182
But we're going to operate
just as if the bars were there.

352
00:34:31,374 --> 00:34:35,633
You stay on that side of the line
and everything should work out fine.

353
00:34:36,016 --> 00:34:37,359
What?

354
00:34:37,551 --> 00:34:40,697
While you're in this jail,
you stay on that side of the line

355
00:34:40,966 --> 00:34:43,766
and you and I will get along fine.

356
00:34:44,073 --> 00:34:47,795
You expect me to sit here
in this lousy cell...?

357
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:52,207
What is that red stuff
all over the floor there?

358
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:57,003
Oh, that's the poor fella
that crossed the line earlier today.

359
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:03,334
Now, Joe, you just stay right there
and behave yourself.

360
00:35:03,641 --> 00:35:07,247
- Maybe if you wanted something to read.
- Read?

361
00:35:07,554 --> 00:35:10,048
No, I guess you wouldn't.

362
00:35:10,317 --> 00:35:11,775
Sorry.

363
00:35:14,154 --> 00:35:16,763
- Well, I see you found a badge.
- Yeah.

364
00:35:17,069 --> 00:35:19,065
Are we gonna set out
to clean up this town?

365
00:35:19,256 --> 00:35:21,674
- I guess that's about it.
- All by ourselves?

366
00:35:21,827 --> 00:35:24,436
Not that we'd turn down any help
cheerfully offered.

367
00:35:24,628 --> 00:35:27,429
Nobody is gonna offer no help,
cheerful or any other way.

368
00:35:27,697 --> 00:35:30,575
I think you're probably right, Jake.

369
00:35:34,335 --> 00:35:36,598
How much money
am I makin' in this job?

370
00:35:36,829 --> 00:35:41,241
Well, let's see. I'm the sheriff
and they're paying me $150 a month.

371
00:35:41,625 --> 00:35:44,963
Shall we put your salary
at about half that, plus room and board?

372
00:35:45,231 --> 00:35:48,339
Plus all the ammunition you need
to carry on the job.

373
00:35:48,531 --> 00:35:52,368
Of course, I haven't checked out your
employment with the mayor and council.

374
00:35:52,636 --> 00:35:55,590
- You mean they might turn me down?
- I don't think so.

375
00:35:55,782 --> 00:35:58,276
No, I think their attitude is going to be,

376
00:35:58,506 --> 00:36:02,343
if we found somebody cra... willing
to take the job, don't rock the boat.

377
00:36:02,727 --> 00:36:06,832
You can bet
that's what their attitude's gonna be.

378
00:36:09,134 --> 00:36:11,551
Ever been sheriff of a town
that needed cleanin' up?

379
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:14,237
- No, I haven't.
- Ever been the sheriff of any town?

380
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:19,493
No, not that either. But the mayor seemed
to think my qualifications suited the job.

381
00:36:19,762 --> 00:36:23,714
He'd have thought that if you was blind
in both eyes and crippled in both legs.

382
00:36:23,982 --> 00:36:27,550
I think you've got
the situation pegged, Jake.

383
00:36:27,819 --> 00:36:32,922
- Want me to warm some coffee?
- I never turn down a cup of coffee.

384
00:36:34,648 --> 00:36:36,874
- How long you been out west?
- About four years.

385
00:36:37,142 --> 00:36:39,329
- From where?
- East.

386
00:36:39,636 --> 00:36:44,624
- I was raised up in Indiana.
- Well, that could be either good or bad.

387
00:36:46,849 --> 00:36:49,497
Them four years you been out west,
what you been doin'?

388
00:36:49,727 --> 00:36:53,755
Well, mostly,
I've been on my way to Australia.

389
00:36:54,139 --> 00:36:58,513
- For four years?
- It takes some people longer than others.

390
00:36:58,897 --> 00:37:02,925
- What's in Australia?
- A lot of things. You'd be surprised.

391
00:37:03,232 --> 00:37:07,338
- Any other questions, Jake?
- Oh, I... There's no...

392
00:37:07,644 --> 00:37:13,476
No, it's all right. If there's anything I want,
it's a deputy who's at ease in his mind.

393
00:37:13,783 --> 00:37:15,893
Well, you ain't got one.

394
00:37:16,162 --> 00:37:20,114
I don't know where you're gonna
get one in this town, either.

395
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,445
- Why Australia?
- You'd know if you'd read a book about it.

396
00:37:26,751 --> 00:37:30,588
- I ain't never even seen a book about it.
- They got one in the library in Chicago.

397
00:37:30,857 --> 00:37:33,044
If you're ever up that way,
take a look at it.

398
00:37:33,274 --> 00:37:37,187
They got pictures, everything.
They got little people over there, like that.

399
00:37:37,379 --> 00:37:40,947
They got a stick that when they
throw it away, it comes back at 'em.

400
00:37:41,216 --> 00:37:42,943
They got some animals there...

401
00:37:43,134 --> 00:37:48,391
They got one that hops. It'll box you.
It carries things in its tummy.

402
00:37:59,747 --> 00:38:02,970
When you shot
that friend of Joe's in the back,

403
00:38:03,201 --> 00:38:05,886
you fired two shots.

404
00:38:06,155 --> 00:38:10,951
I figure they went in, oh...
about that far apart, huh?

405
00:38:11,258 --> 00:38:12,946
Pretty sloppy shootin', Jake.

406
00:38:13,176 --> 00:38:17,090
I was in a hurry to save your life.
I wasn't trying to group my shots.

407
00:38:17,397 --> 00:38:20,734
If you'd been five feet further away,
you'd have missed him entirely.

408
00:38:21,003 --> 00:38:24,456
I'd say that was
a pretty pitiful showing, Jake.

409
00:38:24,686 --> 00:38:27,564
- You see that bottom nail on the right?
- Yeah.

410
00:38:31,286 --> 00:38:33,511
- That's weird.
- What's weird?

411
00:38:33,664 --> 00:38:36,849
- That anybody can shoot like that.
- Just a matter of practice.

412
00:38:37,233 --> 00:38:41,184
How come nobody ever heard of you,
a man that can shoot like that?

413
00:38:41,453 --> 00:38:45,021
- How come you ain't got a reputation?
- What would I want with a reputation?

414
00:38:45,175 --> 00:38:47,477
That's a good way to get yourself killed.

415
00:38:47,707 --> 00:38:51,927
You just go on practisin'
while I put Joe back in jail.

416
00:39:07,274 --> 00:39:08,694
Joe.

417
00:39:08,809 --> 00:39:12,722
I took the bullets out.
You just won't play the game, will you?

418
00:39:13,106 --> 00:39:16,099
I keep layin' down the rules.
You don't pay any attention.

419
00:39:16,252 --> 00:39:19,552
Just wait till my pa and two brothers
find out you've got me in here.

420
00:39:19,935 --> 00:39:23,465
I'm lookin' forward
to meeting your whole family.

421
00:39:23,849 --> 00:39:25,691
Go on.

422
00:39:36,971 --> 00:39:40,462
It's bad enough I was dragged
out of that saloon in front of my friends.

423
00:39:40,731 --> 00:39:44,567
Oh, I doubt if you have all that many
friends that you need to be upset, Joe.

424
00:39:44,874 --> 00:39:48,136
And then I have to sit there
in that lousy cell.

425
00:39:48,327 --> 00:39:51,167
Pa is gonna skin me alive
for getting caught.

426
00:39:51,474 --> 00:39:55,118
He won't mind you murderin' that man,
he just doesn't like you gettin' caught?

427
00:39:55,387 --> 00:39:58,840
I didn't murder anybody.
That was self-defence. It was him or me.

428
00:39:59,224 --> 00:40:02,984
Well, we'll let the judge decide that.
We do have a judge around here?

429
00:40:03,176 --> 00:40:06,053
Never needed one till you come to town
and ruined everything.

430
00:40:06,437 --> 00:40:10,465
- Spoiled all your fun, huh, Joe?
- You can say that again.

431
00:40:11,616 --> 00:40:13,420
That's funny...

432
00:40:15,453 --> 00:40:17,256
That's real funny.

433
00:40:48,641 --> 00:40:51,902
I hope you ain't got no religious
convictions against drinking.

434
00:40:52,094 --> 00:40:54,319
Not since I gave up my parish.

435
00:40:54,588 --> 00:40:56,506
I'm only kidding, Mayor.

436
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,763
- Mayor, what about my deputy?
- No problem.

437
00:41:01,993 --> 00:41:05,830
- I'm curious as to why you picked Jake.
- Jake backed me up when it counted.

438
00:41:06,098 --> 00:41:09,743
I'd have to wait and find that out about
another man. Then it might be too late.

439
00:41:10,127 --> 00:41:11,853
How about a judge?

440
00:41:12,122 --> 00:41:14,731
The need for one
ain't exactly been felt up to now.

441
00:41:14,923 --> 00:41:18,184
- That's what Joe said.
- If I can't appoint one, who can?

442
00:41:52,254 --> 00:41:54,825
Some show you put on
at the saloon this afternoon.

443
00:41:55,017 --> 00:41:57,511
- Kind of sobered up the whole town.
- That's good.

444
00:41:58,547 --> 00:42:00,580
Maybe. Maybe not.

445
00:42:00,772 --> 00:42:06,220
It has been a lot of fun here up to now.
Everything kinda wide open and relaxed.

446
00:42:06,604 --> 00:42:10,057
Nobody lookin' down their noses
at anybody who shot somebody else,

447
00:42:10,364 --> 00:42:12,474
poking their noses
into nobody's business

448
00:42:12,858 --> 00:42:16,579
without getting their big noses
blasted off in the process.

449
00:42:16,810 --> 00:42:20,416
I guess now that we've got law and order,
churches will start movin' in.

450
00:42:20,723 --> 00:42:22,565
That's usually the next thing.

451
00:42:22,833 --> 00:42:26,094
Then the women will start forming
committees, having bazaars.

452
00:42:26,286 --> 00:42:31,274
Then they'll chase Madame Orr's girls
outta town or make 'em get married.

453
00:42:31,543 --> 00:42:36,530
But what the hell. Like you said, the law's
the law and we all gotta face up to it.

454
00:42:36,914 --> 00:42:38,832
- When did I say that?
- You know what I mean.

455
00:42:39,139 --> 00:42:42,017
Well, I was just short of money
when you offered me this job.

456
00:42:42,209 --> 00:42:46,046
But you didn't have to take it. I mean,
there's dozens of other jobs around.

457
00:42:46,429 --> 00:42:49,307
Well, don't worry about it.
I'm not going to keep it too long.

458
00:42:49,575 --> 00:42:51,992
I'm just passin' through
on my way to Australia.

459
00:42:52,261 --> 00:42:54,103
I'll drink to that.

460
00:43:26,715 --> 00:43:28,710
Argh!

461
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:32,393
- What are you...?
- You was on fire, Prudy! You was on fire!

462
00:43:32,662 --> 00:43:35,079
Fire?

463
00:43:35,348 --> 00:43:36,614
Oh...

464
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:41,218
I'm sick and tired of these stupid things
that have been happenin' to me.

465
00:43:41,371 --> 00:43:45,975
And somebody'd better
do something about it soon.

466
00:43:46,282 --> 00:43:49,659
- That's quite a daughter you got.
- I think she's crazy.

467
00:43:49,927 --> 00:43:52,344
Why would you think that?
I know why I'd think...

468
00:43:52,498 --> 00:43:57,486
She had some shocks this year. She got
wealthy overnight. It unhinged her.

469
00:43:57,793 --> 00:44:01,553
Then she was always big for her age
and puberty hit her hard. That'll do it.

470
00:44:01,821 --> 00:44:03,931
- I didn't know that.
- Well, it will!

471
00:44:04,123 --> 00:44:06,924
As a disinterested stranger,
how does she hit you?

472
00:44:07,193 --> 00:44:09,687
- Well, she...
- You are disinterested, ain't you?

473
00:44:09,994 --> 00:44:12,180
Oh, I think you could safely say that.

474
00:44:12,449 --> 00:44:14,598
She's a rich gal in her own name, Sheriff.

475
00:44:14,751 --> 00:44:17,667
Sole owner of the Millard Frymore
Memorial Mining Company.

476
00:44:18,051 --> 00:44:20,890
- Whoever marries her gets the mine?
- Shaft and all.

477
00:44:21,197 --> 00:44:25,110
Yeah, well, that won't hurt her
in certain circles, will it?

478
00:44:25,417 --> 00:44:27,719
I better fry us up something to eat.

479
00:44:28,026 --> 00:44:32,630
No, thank you. I better go down and
relieve Jake. This is his first night on duty.

480
00:44:33,014 --> 00:44:35,201
- You expectin' trouble?
- What do you think?

481
00:44:35,470 --> 00:44:38,654
The Danbys. Some people think
you could've waited a couple of days

482
00:44:39,038 --> 00:44:41,723
before you stuck your nose
in our biggest hornet nest.

483
00:44:41,992 --> 00:44:46,443
When you set out to clean up a mess,
you don't watch that mess get bigger.

484
00:44:46,711 --> 00:44:48,745
I guess you know what you're doin'.

485
00:44:49,013 --> 00:44:52,850
I don't know what I could've said
to give you that idea, Mayor.

486
00:44:53,234 --> 00:44:55,037
Puberty.

487
00:45:29,798 --> 00:45:33,136
You gonna stick to your plan of
handling this by yourself, are you, Pa?

488
00:45:33,519 --> 00:45:37,164
Since when did it take more than one
Danby to take care of a thing like this?

489
00:45:37,471 --> 00:45:40,924
You know what a tiger you are.
You're liable to go chargin' in there...

490
00:45:41,193 --> 00:45:44,531
- And what?
- Nothing. I didn't mean nothing.

491
00:45:44,838 --> 00:45:47,524
You ain't got brains enough
to mean nothing.

492
00:45:47,715 --> 00:45:49,902
You two go in here
and order yourselves a drink.

493
00:45:50,209 --> 00:45:53,202
I'll be back with Joe
before you can finish 'em.

494
00:46:12,923 --> 00:46:17,258
I believe you've got one of my children
in your jail here.

495
00:46:17,527 --> 00:46:20,328
How dare you walk into my office
and pull a gun on me?

496
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:24,165
- Get your finger out of the end of my gun!
- How dare you pull a gun on me?

497
00:46:24,548 --> 00:46:26,275
I said take your finger out.

498
00:46:26,351 --> 00:46:30,687
Until I do, take your finger off that trigger
and let the hammer down real slow.

499
00:46:45,267 --> 00:46:47,454
If that went off,
it'd have blown up in my face.

500
00:46:47,837 --> 00:46:51,022
It wouldn't have done my finger
a hell of a lot of good, either.

501
00:46:51,214 --> 00:46:54,743
- What can I do for you, Mr Danby?
- My son Joe.

502
00:46:55,050 --> 00:46:57,659
Well, it seems Joe
murdered a man this afternoon.

503
00:46:57,813 --> 00:47:00,115
I heard he killed a man
in a fair gunfight.

504
00:47:00,345 --> 00:47:03,108
- I was standin' right there.
- Standin' right where?

505
00:47:03,414 --> 00:47:06,177
In the saloon when Joe killed him.

506
00:47:06,484 --> 00:47:09,054
Well, now, that was
real smart of him, wasn't it?

507
00:47:09,323 --> 00:47:14,234
I've been around Joe all afternoon.
I haven't seen him do one smart thing yet.

508
00:47:14,618 --> 00:47:16,459
- Anything else?
- Can I see him?

509
00:47:16,613 --> 00:47:19,606
Why didn't you take that approach
when you came in? In there.

510
00:47:19,797 --> 00:47:21,716
I'm obliged to you.

511
00:47:33,034 --> 00:47:34,876
- Hi, Pa.
- What is this?

512
00:47:36,410 --> 00:47:39,173
No bars on the window.
No bars in the cell.

513
00:47:39,365 --> 00:47:41,283
No bars nowhere.

514
00:47:42,242 --> 00:47:46,079
- What's keepin' you in here?
- That guy out there.

515
00:47:46,271 --> 00:47:48,765
He won't let me move
without jumpin' down my throat.

516
00:47:49,148 --> 00:47:51,834
Besides, he lies to me
about whether my gun is loaded.

517
00:47:52,141 --> 00:47:55,287
- He does what?
- Are you gonna get me outta here or not?

518
00:47:55,594 --> 00:47:58,740
Never mind that. Who was it you killed?

519
00:47:59,047 --> 00:48:01,886
I don't know his name.
He was some bum in the saloon.

520
00:48:02,117 --> 00:48:07,181
Besides, he drew first. Are you gonna
believe me or that liar out there?

521
00:48:07,565 --> 00:48:11,709
- Why don't you shut up?
- It wasn't anybody that we know.

522
00:48:11,977 --> 00:48:15,622
Pa, you always told me there wasn't
a jail that could hold a Danby.

523
00:48:15,929 --> 00:48:18,998
- Well, now they built one.
- Oh...

524
00:48:19,152 --> 00:48:21,761
You'll have to stay here
for a couple of days.

525
00:48:22,068 --> 00:48:24,255
But we run this town.

526
00:48:24,447 --> 00:48:29,895
I gotta throw in with that sheriff that
you don't dazzle with your intelligence.

527
00:48:30,202 --> 00:48:36,149
Now, you just sit tight here till I've had
a chance to think this thing out.

528
00:48:36,647 --> 00:48:38,643
Couldn't you do it
when he weren't lookin'?

529
00:48:38,834 --> 00:48:41,520
He wasn't the sheriff
when he done seen me do it.

530
00:48:41,789 --> 00:48:46,700
I didn't think of that before. That could be
a loophole to get me out of here.

531
00:48:47,083 --> 00:48:53,222
Don't you try to do nothing about this
situation. Leave that to me and the boys.

532
00:48:58,402 --> 00:49:01,740
- That's a lousy jail you got in there.
- We're just gettin' started.

533
00:49:04,732 --> 00:49:07,610
- What's he supposed to be?
- That's my deputy.

534
00:49:10,181 --> 00:49:13,749
Last week, he was shovelling horse...
working in the stable.

535
00:49:14,017 --> 00:49:16,626
Well, he's been promoted.

536
00:49:16,818 --> 00:49:20,540
I'm gonna find out
what's happened to this town.

537
00:49:28,981 --> 00:49:30,899
What did Danby want?

538
00:49:31,206 --> 00:49:32,165
Oh...

539
00:49:32,434 --> 00:49:37,153
He just came in and we talked a while.
He went in to see Joe.

540
00:49:37,421 --> 00:49:41,757
He came back out,
we talked a little more, then he left.

541
00:49:43,177 --> 00:49:44,711
You know...

542
00:49:45,018 --> 00:49:50,313
- He strikes me as being a lonely man.
- Lonely? Danby?

543
00:49:50,697 --> 00:49:52,884
He's a mean, no-good,
low-down bushwhacker.

544
00:49:53,075 --> 00:49:55,953
Well, now, there, you see?
No wonder he's lonely.

545
00:49:59,598 --> 00:50:01,439
He stuck his finger in your what?

546
00:50:01,593 --> 00:50:04,010
Would you shut up?
Everybody will be lookin'.

547
00:50:04,202 --> 00:50:07,732
I don't understand what happened.
You said you had your gun on him.

548
00:50:08,039 --> 00:50:12,259
I ain't gonna explain it again.
I don't have to explain nothing to you two.

549
00:50:12,643 --> 00:50:17,554
Instead of sittin' here askin' questions,
why don't you come up with suggestions?

550
00:50:17,822 --> 00:50:20,009
Why don't the three of us go over there?

551
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:22,426
I don't care
if he is the fastest gun anywhere.

552
00:50:22,695 --> 00:50:25,381
- Who says he's the fastest gun?
- Everybody.

553
00:50:25,688 --> 00:50:27,913
That's all they're talkin' about
all over town.

554
00:50:28,182 --> 00:50:32,402
- What could he do against three of us?
- He could kill two of us.

555
00:50:32,671 --> 00:50:34,589
You ain't talkin' like yourself, Pa.

556
00:50:34,896 --> 00:50:37,198
You always charge in
and we hold you back.

557
00:50:37,505 --> 00:50:41,035
- We ain't gonna leave Joe to get hung?
- Well, of course we ain't.

558
00:50:41,418 --> 00:50:43,644
Who says we gotta
take care of the sheriff?

559
00:50:43,797 --> 00:50:47,480
Who says anybody has to? Why don't we
run him outta town like the last sheriff?

560
00:50:47,864 --> 00:50:49,859
Because this one won't go.

561
00:50:51,394 --> 00:50:54,655
He didn't throw a scare into you,
did he, Pa?

562
00:50:54,924 --> 00:50:58,223
I didn't mean that the way it sounded.

563
00:50:58,377 --> 00:51:01,063
I just meant...
Well, what did he do to you, Pa?

564
00:51:01,293 --> 00:51:03,365
He maybe made me
a little more thoughtful.

565
00:51:03,672 --> 00:51:07,585
He maybe made me realise that now
we've got a little money for the first time

566
00:51:07,969 --> 00:51:09,618
and a chance to get a lot more,

567
00:51:09,810 --> 00:51:12,688
this would be a dumb time
to find out who's fastest with a gun -

568
00:51:12,956 --> 00:51:16,525
us or some show-off that might be lucky
even if he weren't good.

569
00:51:16,793 --> 00:51:21,129
- If we don't take care of him, who does?
- There's always some tramp to be hired.

570
00:51:21,397 --> 00:51:25,157
But you always said that
the Danbys fight their own battles.

571
00:51:25,464 --> 00:51:28,687
Maybe I was talkin'
about another branch of the family.

572
00:51:28,917 --> 00:51:33,023
I'm gonna take a little trip tomorrow. You
two behave yourselves while I'm gone.

573
00:51:33,406 --> 00:51:37,435
I don't want nobody to make
no martyr out of this here sheriff.

574
00:51:37,819 --> 00:51:39,737
- What's a martyr?
- I'm sorry.

575
00:51:39,929 --> 00:51:42,883
They didn't use words like that
in the third grade, did they?

576
00:51:43,113 --> 00:51:46,566
- How would I know? I didn't get that far.
- Ah!

577
00:51:50,173 --> 00:51:53,242
You remember when I was stuck
all them years in the second grade.

578
00:51:53,549 --> 00:51:55,468
Shut up!

579
00:52:07,055 --> 00:52:08,589
Sheriff?

580
00:52:08,819 --> 00:52:10,815
Can I talk to you a minute?

581
00:52:11,006 --> 00:52:12,925
Sure, Miss Prudy.

582
00:52:14,728 --> 00:52:18,181
Could... could we sit down?

583
00:52:18,411 --> 00:52:20,215
Sure.

584
00:52:24,550 --> 00:52:26,238
Well...

585
00:52:26,469 --> 00:52:29,615
- How can I be of service, Miss Prudy?
- What?

586
00:52:29,922 --> 00:52:32,991
- How can I be of service?
- What do you mean, service?

587
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:35,945
I don't mean anything by it.
What do you think I mean?

588
00:52:36,329 --> 00:52:41,048
Look. I'm just a dumb little girl from a hick
town in a jerkwater part of the country.

589
00:52:41,317 --> 00:52:42,660
<i>What?</i>

590
00:52:42,851 --> 00:52:45,345
Nothing. You said
you were dumb little girl...

591
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:47,456
I know what I said.

592
00:52:49,374 --> 00:52:55,244
I wanted to explain some of those
stupid, silly things you saw me doing.

593
00:52:55,628 --> 00:52:59,733
- What stupid, silly things, Miss Prudy?
- What stupid...?

594
00:53:00,002 --> 00:53:04,721
- How about when I burned my dress off?
- That could happen to anyone.

595
00:53:05,105 --> 00:53:10,092
How about in the mud when I was trying
to defend myself from that... pervert?

596
00:53:10,361 --> 00:53:15,080
That's just one of those things that any
overstimulated girl might get caught into.

597
00:53:15,349 --> 00:53:18,149
How about up in the tree,
half-naked, drippin' wet?

598
00:53:18,418 --> 00:53:21,794
That one could take a little explanation.

599
00:53:22,869 --> 00:53:25,708
Well, it was one of those days
when everything goes wrong.

600
00:53:26,015 --> 00:53:28,394
Actually, every one
of those ridiculous things

601
00:53:28,701 --> 00:53:31,578
has a perfectly simple explanation.

602
00:53:32,729 --> 00:53:38,101
Not that it matters. I just thought
it was dumb to have such an...

603
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:42,820
attractive man thinking
I was a hopeless loony.

604
00:53:44,048 --> 00:53:46,810
Well, loony maybe, but hopeless...

605
00:53:47,961 --> 00:53:49,112
You...

606
00:53:49,342 --> 00:53:53,332
- You think I'm attractive?
- Well...

607
00:53:53,716 --> 00:53:57,092
I don't think a girl would curl up and die
because you smiled at her.

608
00:53:57,399 --> 00:54:00,354
But, yes, I think you're attractive.

609
00:54:00,622 --> 00:54:04,766
Well, Miss Prudy, I can see
that you're a young lady

610
00:54:05,073 --> 00:54:07,835
who believes in laying
her cards on the table.

611
00:54:08,027 --> 00:54:10,214
- In what?
- Laying your cards on the table.

612
00:54:10,444 --> 00:54:16,852
When a girl does that, I think that a man
should lay his cards on the table too.

613
00:54:17,350 --> 00:54:22,338
Anybody can see that you're
a very pretty and very attractive girl.

614
00:54:22,607 --> 00:54:27,595
Any man in his right mind would be
only too glad to take you out on a picnic

615
00:54:27,863 --> 00:54:30,933
or out for a walk in the evening.

616
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:34,616
Well, I'd feel privileged to do just that.

617
00:54:36,227 --> 00:54:41,675
However, if you're thinking of anything
more serious, I'm on my way to Australia.

618
00:54:41,982 --> 00:54:45,512
- I'm just passing through here.
- Why, you conceited...

619
00:54:45,896 --> 00:54:48,428
I'm only telling you
that I'm on my way to Australia.

620
00:54:48,582 --> 00:54:50,615
Who cares where you're on your way to?

621
00:54:50,884 --> 00:54:56,562
Any girl who was thinking of a permanent
relationship would be glad to know...

622
00:54:56,946 --> 00:55:00,859
I'm not thinking of entering into...
one of those.

623
00:55:01,166 --> 00:55:03,660
- What's the matter with you?
- You think something is?

624
00:55:04,044 --> 00:55:08,149
Do I think...? There isn't enough time
to tell you how much.

625
00:55:09,684 --> 00:55:11,602
Good night.

626
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:20,657
- You all right, Miss Prudy?
- Shut up and mind your own business.

627
00:55:23,611 --> 00:55:26,182
<i>- Damn! Damn! Damn!
- Prudy!</i>

628
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:28,330
You shut up too!

629
00:55:46,363 --> 00:55:48,281
Well, do you see anything?

630
00:55:48,435 --> 00:55:50,660
No. What are we lookin' for?

631
00:55:50,967 --> 00:55:55,264
What are we lookin' for?
Nuggets. Veins. The mother lode.

632
00:55:55,571 --> 00:55:57,566
What's the mother lode?

633
00:55:57,873 --> 00:56:01,979
I'm beginning to get the feeling you know
less about gold-mining than I do.

634
00:56:02,170 --> 00:56:04,281
Of course I don't know about gold-mining.

635
00:56:04,472 --> 00:56:08,501
Why do you think I brought you along?
Everyone around here knows about it.

636
00:56:08,770 --> 00:56:12,913
I don't. I might be able to give you
a few tips about shovelling horse...

637
00:56:13,297 --> 00:56:17,709
working around a stable, but I don't
know nothing about huntin' gold.

638
00:56:18,093 --> 00:56:20,970
- Mind if I put this stuff down?
- No, you better not.

639
00:56:21,354 --> 00:56:24,730
If I know anything about prospecting,
you gotta keep on the move.

640
00:56:24,884 --> 00:56:26,649
Pity.

641
00:56:26,802 --> 00:56:30,754
Well, here.
Let me redistribute the weight for you.

642
00:56:31,023 --> 00:56:32,864
I feel like a jackass.

643
00:56:35,243 --> 00:56:37,085
There, that oughta do it.

644
00:56:37,392 --> 00:56:39,195
- Come on, Jack.
- Jake.

645
00:57:11,807 --> 00:57:14,762
You're a pretty good fisherman, Jake.

646
00:57:17,562 --> 00:57:20,133
- This is more like it, huh?
- More like what?

647
00:57:20,517 --> 00:57:24,354
This is more like the kinda place
I want to go gold-minin' in.

648
00:57:24,660 --> 00:57:26,771
What makes you think
there's any gold here?

649
00:57:27,154 --> 00:57:29,648
What makes you think there isn't?

650
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:33,562
It don't bother you none that Joe is gonna
be miles away by the time we get back?

651
00:57:33,792 --> 00:57:39,547
Not unless he's learned to travel fast
handcuffed to a potbellied stove.

652
00:57:40,007 --> 00:57:42,501
- What do we do now?
- I think we oughta have lunch,

653
00:57:42,693 --> 00:57:46,069
take a little rest,
and then you start diggin'.

654
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:51,057
Hey, Jake, how do you think
we oughta split whatever we find?

655
00:57:51,326 --> 00:57:53,244
60-40?

656
00:57:54,395 --> 00:57:56,889
60 for who and 40 for who?

657
00:57:57,081 --> 00:57:59,652
There, you see?
See what gold does to men?

658
00:57:59,882 --> 00:58:02,644
We haven't even found anything
and already we're arguing.

659
00:58:03,028 --> 00:58:06,404
60 for who and 40 for who?

660
00:58:06,558 --> 00:58:09,359
I just wish you could see
the greed in your face.

661
00:58:09,627 --> 00:58:12,697
What you mean is 60 for you
and 40 for me.

662
00:58:12,927 --> 00:58:16,917
Well, thank you, Jake.
That's very generous of you.

663
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:22,595
Hey, Jake.

664
00:58:22,902 --> 00:58:26,739
Jake, what did you do
before you became my deputy?

665
00:58:28,811 --> 00:58:31,228
I did odd jobs.

666
00:58:31,497 --> 00:58:33,031
Like what?

667
00:58:33,261 --> 00:58:35,448
I was a whore-holder
at Madame Horse's...

668
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:37,482
A horse-holder at Madame Orr's house.

669
00:58:37,750 --> 00:58:40,321
- You were a what?
- Horse-holder.

670
00:58:40,551 --> 00:58:43,237
See, on Saturday night,
that hitch rack would get full.

671
00:58:43,506 --> 00:58:45,808
I'd hold the extra horses,
sometimes all night.

672
00:58:45,999 --> 00:58:48,877
It seems to me like you spent
a lot of time with horses.

673
00:58:49,146 --> 00:58:50,527
One end or the other.

674
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:54,747
Course, I come by it natural. My daddy
stole horses for a livin'. They hung him.

675
00:58:55,131 --> 00:58:59,351
That's a terrible thing for a sheriff
to suddenly find out about his deputy.

676
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:02,037
If you hadn't shoved
this job down my throat,

677
00:59:02,191 --> 00:59:05,260
you might have found out a lot of things.

678
00:59:07,178 --> 00:59:09,480
- Want my badge back?
- Don't be silly.

679
00:59:11,782 --> 00:59:17,077
Jake, you better clean up those fish.
I'll take a little nap.

680
00:59:17,384 --> 00:59:23,139
- Sure I won't disturb you none?
- No, just don't rattle the pots and pans.

681
00:59:45,929 --> 00:59:49,766
I'll be wantin' you boys to ride into town
more quietly from now on.

682
00:59:49,996 --> 00:59:53,718
- You drove your point home real good.
- Good. Good.

683
01:00:12,326 --> 01:00:14,628
Well, that kind of brightens up
the whole place.

684
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:18,849
At least I don't feel so naked and stupid
sitting in here day after day.

685
01:00:19,232 --> 01:00:22,762
Joe, if Jake comes in, tell him
I went down to the store to see the mayor.

686
01:00:23,069 --> 01:00:24,988
- Have you seen my daddy?
- No.

687
01:00:25,294 --> 01:00:28,134
Not since the night he came in here
and we had that little chat.

688
01:00:28,517 --> 01:00:31,894
Don't you worry, Joe.
I'm sure he's planning a little jailbreak.

689
01:00:32,086 --> 01:00:36,306
- You really think so?
- What else would they be doing?

690
01:00:59,595 --> 01:01:02,281
Where will I find the sheriff?

691
01:01:02,588 --> 01:01:04,813
I imagine he's in the jail...

692
01:01:04,966 --> 01:01:05,964
No.

693
01:01:06,117 --> 01:01:09,571
Wait a minute. There he is
comin' out of the hardware store there.

694
01:01:09,877 --> 01:01:12,371
- Much obliged.
- Pleasure.

695
01:01:17,628 --> 01:01:19,393
Sheriff.

696
01:01:32,131 --> 01:01:35,392
- Anybody know who he was?
- I think he just rode into town.

697
01:01:35,660 --> 01:01:39,113
He asked me where you was.
I seen you coming out of the hardware...

698
01:01:44,715 --> 01:01:47,401
Thanks for pointin' me out to him.

699
01:02:31,140 --> 01:02:35,744
Hold it just a minute.
You don't want to go in there right now.

700
01:02:37,163 --> 01:02:41,115
Wait here just a minute,
I'll come back and I'll join you.

701
01:02:49,633 --> 01:02:52,395
Honey, I think I just been...

702
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:01,604
- Ever see him before?
- Uh-uh.

703
01:03:05,824 --> 01:03:07,474
Jake.

704
01:03:07,589 --> 01:03:09,392
After lunch...

705
01:03:20,902 --> 01:03:24,931
- Afternoon, Sheriff.
- We ain't makin' any dust at all today.

706
01:03:31,837 --> 01:03:34,062
- Another one of 'em rode into town.
- You sure?

707
01:03:34,331 --> 01:03:39,204
Can't miss a professional gunfighter.
They got a look ain't like anyone else.

708
01:03:39,511 --> 01:03:41,429
He's been askin' around to find you.

709
01:03:41,621 --> 01:03:46,724
- I'm sure gettin' sick of all this stuff.
- This stuff would make me sick too.

710
01:03:48,527 --> 01:03:50,637
Well...

711
01:03:56,009 --> 01:03:59,769
Why do these jaspers
always have to hit town at mealtime?

712
01:04:00,152 --> 01:04:05,600
- Are you gonna kill another man?
- I'm sure we all hope it turns out that way.

713
01:04:10,205 --> 01:04:14,732
This sure is a childish way
for a grown man to make a living.

714
01:04:39,671 --> 01:04:42,740
- Go for your gun, Sheriff.
- You go to hell.

715
01:04:54,250 --> 01:04:56,054
And stay out.

716
01:04:57,013 --> 01:04:59,622
If either one of you
opens his fat, stupid mouth,

717
01:04:59,890 --> 01:05:03,996
I'll chase you right out of town
after that other yellow dog.

718
01:05:14,662 --> 01:05:16,580
Leave the bottle.

719
01:05:18,499 --> 01:05:20,993
- All right, now he's done it.
- Who?

720
01:05:21,261 --> 01:05:23,179
- That sheriff.
- What's he done?

721
01:05:23,486 --> 01:05:26,172
He's pushed me too far this time.
That's what he's done.

722
01:05:26,364 --> 01:05:30,853
I've been bending over backwards
up to now. That's all finished.

723
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:32,886
You know I've bent over backwards.

724
01:05:33,155 --> 01:05:36,416
You ain't let him push you into no corner
where you could be provoked.

725
01:05:36,838 --> 01:05:39,716
Right. But from now on,
I'm tired of being a nice fella.

726
01:05:39,984 --> 01:05:42,593
Pa, have you been
touchin' up your hair again?

727
01:05:42,747 --> 01:05:45,356
- What do you mean, again?
- Nothing.

728
01:05:45,740 --> 01:05:48,617
- It just looks better in spots, that's all.
- What do you mean?

729
01:05:48,809 --> 01:05:50,152
Nothing.

730
01:05:50,420 --> 01:05:52,646
What are we gonna do, Pa?

731
01:05:52,838 --> 01:05:54,756
- Get Joe out of jail.
- How?

732
01:05:55,063 --> 01:05:59,360
Leave that to me. I got it all figured out.
We'll do it tonight.

733
01:06:03,273 --> 01:06:06,151
You get ready,
cos this is gonna happen awful fast.

734
01:06:06,458 --> 01:06:08,300
- Pa.
- Huh?

735
01:06:09,988 --> 01:06:11,906
Nothing. It's all right.

736
01:06:23,263 --> 01:06:29,095
When I yell go, we all go together.
And use your spurs. All ready? Yah!

737
01:06:33,507 --> 01:06:35,617
- Now he's really done it.
- Who?

738
01:06:35,809 --> 01:06:37,612
That sheriff.

739
01:06:40,528 --> 01:06:43,367
- I could've told you it wouldn't work.
- Why not?

740
01:06:43,674 --> 01:06:46,360
Because they set these bars in too solid.

741
01:06:46,667 --> 01:06:49,506
- What do you know about anything?
- I helped to set 'em in.

742
01:06:49,813 --> 01:06:51,655
You...?

743
01:06:52,614 --> 01:06:55,070
Luke, I want you two
to round up the horses.

744
01:06:55,376 --> 01:06:59,482
Ride over to your Uncle Milt's. Tell him
to bring Steve and George and Young Milt.

745
01:06:59,789 --> 01:07:02,206
And, Tom, you ride out to Uncle Ira's.

746
01:07:02,398 --> 01:07:07,270
You tell him to bring Billy and Jack
and anyone else he can think to bring.

747
01:07:07,539 --> 01:07:10,417
- I ain't foolin' around no longer.
- That's a two-day ride.

748
01:07:10,723 --> 01:07:14,368
I know far it is. Stop at the ranch
and pick up some grub.

749
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:16,747
Tell Milt and Ira we'll all meet Friday.

750
01:07:17,131 --> 01:07:19,471
If any of them feel
that they don't wanna come,

751
01:07:19,663 --> 01:07:22,809
you just remind them of the mortgages
I help them to pay.

752
01:07:23,001 --> 01:07:25,111
Well, all right, get going.

753
01:07:30,406 --> 01:07:33,936
- You helped 'em put in those bars?
- I didn't have nothin' else to do.

754
01:07:34,319 --> 01:07:36,813
They was gonna put the bars in
whether I helped or not.

755
01:07:37,005 --> 01:07:39,000
They'll hang you
whether you helped or not.

756
01:07:39,307 --> 01:07:42,185
Pa, I don't think
that they are really gonna hang me.

757
01:07:42,377 --> 01:07:45,139
They laugh and they joke,
but I don't think they'll do it.

758
01:07:45,523 --> 01:07:48,132
- You'll see whether they hang you or...
- Don't move!

759
01:07:51,278 --> 01:07:54,194
- What's goin' on back here?
- That's all I need.

760
01:07:54,347 --> 01:07:57,724
Some stable bum orderin' me around.

761
01:07:58,031 --> 01:08:00,409
This is my saddle
and I'm taking it with me.

762
01:08:00,601 --> 01:08:02,404
I know it ain't mine, so go ahead.

763
01:08:02,635 --> 01:08:05,973
In just a few days now,
I'll take care of you.

764
01:08:10,769 --> 01:08:13,186
What was he tryin' to do,
bust you outta here?

765
01:08:13,378 --> 01:08:15,181
Yeah.

766
01:08:15,373 --> 01:08:19,286
You know Pa.
Got a heart as big as the whole outdoors.

767
01:08:20,284 --> 01:08:23,890
But he don't have one brain
in his poor old head.

768
01:08:44,839 --> 01:08:49,213
May I compliment you on getting
such a romantic idea, Miss Prudy?

769
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:51,553
Nothing romantic about it, Sheriff.

770
01:08:51,822 --> 01:08:55,927
Nothing romantic about a man and a girl
out for a ride on a warm afternoon?

771
01:08:56,234 --> 01:09:00,646
You think what you want to, Sheriff.
But you'd do that anyway, wouldn't you?

772
01:09:00,953 --> 01:09:05,327
It's surprising how well you've gotten
to know me in such a short time.

773
01:09:16,070 --> 01:09:19,063
Would you like to get out
and talk a minute, Sheriff?

774
01:09:19,370 --> 01:09:21,288
All right.

775
01:09:38,323 --> 01:09:41,239
Light yourself up a cigar
if you want to, Sheriff.

776
01:09:41,431 --> 01:09:44,577
Thank you, Miss Prudy. I believe I will.

777
01:09:46,764 --> 01:09:51,368
Was there anything in particular that
you wanna talk to me about, Miss Prudy?

778
01:09:51,752 --> 01:09:55,205
In case you didn't know, Milt Danby
is rounding up his two brothers

779
01:09:55,512 --> 01:09:57,891
and all of their sons
and all of their hired hands.

780
01:09:58,197 --> 01:10:00,615
They're gonna ride into town
and take care of you.

781
01:10:00,806 --> 01:10:04,643
- They're gonna get Joe out of jail.
- Yeah, I heard about that.

782
01:10:07,866 --> 01:10:09,708
We've all been trying to remember.

783
01:10:09,900 --> 01:10:13,736
We think there are three grown boys
in Ira Danby's family

784
01:10:14,043 --> 01:10:16,230
and two in Milt Danby's family.

785
01:10:16,422 --> 01:10:19,300
So with the three Danbys here,
and Joe in jail,

786
01:10:19,491 --> 01:10:21,793
we figure that makes about 11.

787
01:10:21,985 --> 01:10:24,364
Plus all of the hired hands
that they bring along.

788
01:10:24,671 --> 01:10:27,165
That's about the figure I arrived at too.

789
01:10:27,357 --> 01:10:30,349
- Ten or 12, maybe.
- Or 14 or 15, maybe.

790
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:35,491
- It's quite a few.
- It's almost a mob, you might say.

791
01:10:36,757 --> 01:10:38,790
Have you figured what you're gonna do?

792
01:10:38,982 --> 01:10:40,593
- More or less.
- What?

793
01:10:42,128 --> 01:10:44,814
I thought I might just leave town.

794
01:10:45,006 --> 01:10:51,029
Just get outta town before they ride in.
Just ride out and keep on going.

795
01:10:51,451 --> 01:10:54,789
- I don't believe it.
- I don't know why not.

796
01:10:55,058 --> 01:10:59,662
I've never made any secret of the fact
that basically I'm on my way to Australia.

797
01:10:59,969 --> 01:11:03,422
I don't think I'm gonna find
a better time to get started than now.

798
01:11:03,729 --> 01:11:06,568
Besides, I don't like the odds.

799
01:11:11,172 --> 01:11:13,705
I just don't believe it.

800
01:11:13,858 --> 01:11:19,460
You better believe it. It's not gonna be
too many hours before I'm long gone.

801
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:25,560
I think that is one of the most mature
things I've ever heard of a man doing.

802
01:11:26,750 --> 01:11:28,860
You think it's what?

803
01:11:29,128 --> 01:11:31,315
Mature.

804
01:11:31,507 --> 01:11:34,960
Any other man would have to stick around
to prove that they are a man

805
01:11:35,152 --> 01:11:37,953
and get a whole town shot up to boot.

806
01:11:38,337 --> 01:11:40,063
Mature?

807
01:11:40,178 --> 01:11:42,826
As opposed to childish
and shot full of holes.

808
01:11:43,132 --> 01:11:45,626
You don't think it sounded
a little cowardly?

809
01:11:45,933 --> 01:11:49,271
For a man to take a job and then
when the going gets a little rough,

810
01:11:49,540 --> 01:11:51,957
he just sneaks out in the dead of night?

811
01:11:52,226 --> 01:11:54,336
You didn't say whether it was day or night.

812
01:11:54,643 --> 01:11:58,671
But the point is, didn't it sound
a little cowardly to you?

813
01:11:58,978 --> 01:12:01,472
No, I told you, it sounds mature.

814
01:12:02,431 --> 01:12:05,194
It sounded cowardly to me
just now when I said it.

815
01:12:05,386 --> 01:12:06,805
It isn't, it's mature.

816
01:12:07,112 --> 01:12:10,182
I know it's cowardly.
I have never done a cowardly thing.

817
01:12:10,373 --> 01:12:12,407
No matter what you
or anybody else thinks.

818
01:12:12,675 --> 01:12:15,553
- I didn't say I thought...
- It isn't mature. It is cowardly.

819
01:12:15,937 --> 01:12:18,622
Let's just call things
by their right name from now on.

820
01:12:18,814 --> 01:12:20,464
What is the matter with you?

821
01:12:20,733 --> 01:12:26,871
I'm surprised at a girl who throws herself
at a man when she thinks he's a coward.

822
01:12:27,831 --> 01:12:28,790
But...

823
01:12:28,866 --> 01:12:30,593
What do you mean, throwing myself?

824
01:12:30,900 --> 01:12:34,813
Did you think that I was gonna turn tail
and run at the first sight of trouble?

825
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:41,643
- Why shouldn't I? That's what you said.
- Well, I'm not, so you just forget about it.

826
01:13:07,426 --> 01:13:09,843
All right! Order! Order!

827
01:13:11,071 --> 01:13:14,907
You all heard the motion.
Those in favour, raise your hands.

828
01:13:15,329 --> 01:13:20,202
- Count them, Henry.
- One, two, three, four, five.

829
01:13:21,622 --> 01:13:24,921
Now, those in favour
of not getting involved

830
01:13:25,075 --> 01:13:27,991
in the crisis which is
about to befall our fair community,

831
01:13:28,259 --> 01:13:33,055
keepin' the hell off the streets and out of
the way of the shooting, raise your hands.

832
01:13:33,439 --> 01:13:36,700
- Count 'em, Henry.
- Five, ten, fifteen.

833
01:13:37,391 --> 01:13:39,578
I think we've passed that motion.

834
01:13:39,770 --> 01:13:41,419
Order, order!

835
01:13:41,573 --> 01:13:43,875
Be it so entered in the books
of the town council

836
01:13:44,105 --> 01:13:47,520
that the majority has ruled,
and as your mayor...

837
01:13:49,438 --> 01:13:53,697
- I object.
- Get that gun away from her.

838
01:13:53,966 --> 01:13:57,419
- Oh! You can't do this.
- You just shut up and sit down, Prudy.

839
01:13:57,802 --> 01:14:02,138
This is a meeting of the town council
and certain citizens of this community.

840
01:14:02,406 --> 01:14:05,207
You can't just walk in off the street
and insult everyone.

841
01:14:05,361 --> 01:14:09,121
Just one question. How many of you
will help the sheriff against the Danbys?

842
01:14:09,504 --> 01:14:12,881
- It's not as simple as that, Prudy.
- Why not?

843
01:14:13,264 --> 01:14:16,104
There are other factors.
Economic factors.

844
01:14:16,295 --> 01:14:19,019
It could affect the wellbeing
of everyone in this town.

845
01:14:19,173 --> 01:14:21,322
I heard that the sheriff was leaving town.

846
01:14:21,513 --> 01:14:23,892
At the time I heard it, I said to myself

847
01:14:24,084 --> 01:14:26,846
"That sheriff has his head
set squarely on his shoulders. "

848
01:14:27,268 --> 01:14:29,072
Now he's not gonna leave town.

849
01:14:29,187 --> 01:14:32,602
I'd like to get my hands on whoever
caused him to change his mind.

850
01:14:32,908 --> 01:14:36,668
Me too. A man with that good an idea
oughta be encouraged to hold onto it.

851
01:14:36,937 --> 01:14:38,472
What is the matter with you?

852
01:14:38,587 --> 01:14:41,925
Remember how long we waited for a man
who would stand up to the Danbys?

853
01:14:42,193 --> 01:14:45,378
Remember what this town
was like before? Murderin'. Lynchin'.

854
01:14:45,570 --> 01:14:47,680
Miners shootin' up the town
day and night.

855
01:14:47,949 --> 01:14:51,248
Aside from those few things,
it wasn't a bad place at all.

856
01:14:51,517 --> 01:14:54,663
Sure, we had a little misunderstanding
with the Danbys at times.

857
01:14:54,970 --> 01:14:58,423
- They could all be worked out in time.
- Joe Danby's in jail for murder.

858
01:14:58,691 --> 01:15:03,794
That would've solved itself too if the
sheriff had left town like he promised to.

859
01:15:04,178 --> 01:15:06,173
I said it before and I'll say it again.

860
01:15:06,365 --> 01:15:10,432
The men in this town are nothing but
a bunch of low-down, cowardly curs.

861
01:15:10,700 --> 01:15:13,386
As your father,
I may have to take that talk from you,

862
01:15:13,655 --> 01:15:16,264
but as the mayor of this town,
I sure as hell don't.

863
01:15:16,647 --> 01:15:18,489
Throw her out, boys.

864
01:15:18,566 --> 01:15:20,983
And don't be too gentle with her.

865
01:15:26,163 --> 01:15:29,194
Don't let her tie herself to that post.

866
01:15:31,035 --> 01:15:35,447
It's a trick of hers, tying herself to things
when she doesn't want to do something.

867
01:15:39,668 --> 01:15:42,929
- Death to all tyrants.
- What did she say?

868
01:15:43,198 --> 01:15:48,109
Death to somebody. She's always saying
death to somebody she's mad at.

869
01:15:48,953 --> 01:15:49,835
Order!

870
01:16:03,839 --> 01:16:06,602
Forget about gettin' help
from anybody in this town.

871
01:16:06,909 --> 01:16:11,321
- Or from anybody for 100 miles around.
- That takes care of just about everybody.

872
01:16:11,705 --> 01:16:13,738
They can throw a girl out of a meeting,

873
01:16:13,892 --> 01:16:18,112
but they can't defend their town against
a bunch of cutthroats like the Danbys.

874
01:16:18,534 --> 01:16:20,529
What are we gonna do now?

875
01:16:20,798 --> 01:16:23,982
- We?
- Don't turn down any help you can get.

876
01:16:24,174 --> 01:16:27,934
- How's Joe?
- He figures we'll be dead tomorrow.

877
01:16:28,203 --> 01:16:31,963
Did he seem to feel any sorrow
over the fact that we might all be killed?

878
01:16:32,308 --> 01:16:35,684
No, it's more like he planned to dance
and spit all over our graves.

879
01:16:35,991 --> 01:16:40,288
- Sounds like Joe.
- Sure was a good idea, leavin' town.

880
01:16:40,595 --> 01:16:44,125
- You don't have to stay.
- Yes, I do. I gotta stay if you do.

881
01:16:44,509 --> 01:16:46,427
- I took the job.
- So did I.

882
01:16:46,619 --> 01:16:50,955
I'll tell you what. I'll even go to Australia
with you if we leave right now.

883
01:16:51,223 --> 01:16:56,326
We'll go to Australia, but first we got
a few things to do. It's time we got started.

884
01:16:56,710 --> 01:16:59,549
- Prudy, do you really wanna help?
- Sure.

885
01:16:59,779 --> 01:17:01,582
First, get Joe outta here.

886
01:17:01,851 --> 01:17:04,000
- Then what?
- I got a couple of ideas.

887
01:17:04,153 --> 01:17:07,222
If things work out right,
we might live through this thing.

888
01:17:07,606 --> 01:17:09,256
I sure liked his idea about leaving.

889
01:17:32,391 --> 01:17:35,921
Prudy, you go in the courthouse.
Do you know how to use this?

890
01:17:37,187 --> 01:17:39,183
Here, you'll need these.

891
01:17:40,909 --> 01:17:42,444
- Jake, are you there?
- Yeah.

892
01:17:42,636 --> 01:17:45,206
- You know what to do?
- Oh, yeah.

893
01:17:45,398 --> 01:17:48,007
<i>Keep out of the line of fire
whenever I can.</i>

894
01:17:51,076 --> 01:17:55,297
- Mayor.
- Can't talk. Emergency council meeting.

895
01:17:59,249 --> 01:18:04,045
- What's that all about?
- I'm not gonna shoot through the window.

896
01:18:48,819 --> 01:18:51,198
Here. Take care of these.

897
01:18:51,428 --> 01:18:55,035
My eating teeth.
I don't wanna get them all shot up.

898
01:19:06,162 --> 01:19:08,579
Get Joe.

899
01:19:17,595 --> 01:19:21,892
- He ain't in there, Pa.
- Hold it. You're under arrest.

900
01:19:22,276 --> 01:19:24,693
Throw down your guns,
I'll accept your surrender.

901
01:19:27,954 --> 01:19:29,796
Take cover!

902
01:20:26,081 --> 01:20:29,342
- Haven't you heard of just wounding?
- I only know one way to shoot.

903
01:20:29,649 --> 01:20:31,759
That's to kill.

904
01:20:31,951 --> 01:20:35,097
We don't want a massacre on our hands,
so just watch it.

905
01:20:38,052 --> 01:20:41,044
Hold it! Hold it! Settle down out there.

906
01:20:42,003 --> 01:20:43,922
Just hold it.

907
01:20:55,624 --> 01:20:57,159
OK, go ahead.

908
01:21:03,297 --> 01:21:05,868
- Jake, where'd you put Joe?
- Upstairs.

909
01:21:09,244 --> 01:21:11,086
Go get him.

910
01:21:22,750 --> 01:21:24,668
Pa, look. Your teeth.

911
01:21:24,975 --> 01:21:28,044
- They saved my life.
- Always worryin' about your life.

912
01:21:28,351 --> 01:21:31,037
What am I supposed to jaw with
from now on?

913
01:21:31,306 --> 01:21:33,032
Pa, look.

914
01:22:07,755 --> 01:22:13,778
I want all you people to unstrap your
gun belts and throw your rifles down.

915
01:22:14,277 --> 01:22:16,771
<i>Or I'm gonna have to set this thing off.</i>

916
01:22:16,963 --> 01:22:19,917
You don't think you're gonna bluff me
with that cannon?

917
01:22:20,224 --> 01:22:22,450
Why, it ain't even loaded.

918
01:22:22,603 --> 01:22:25,979
- Well, shall we see?
- Believe him, Pa.

919
01:22:26,171 --> 01:22:29,624
You stay outta this,
you miserable coward.

920
01:22:32,617 --> 01:22:34,727
What's it gonna be, Danby?

921
01:22:50,611 --> 01:22:52,760
Jake, let Joe loose.

922
01:22:54,371 --> 01:22:57,901
- Throw the rest of that bunch in jail.
- By myself?

923
01:22:59,052 --> 01:23:00,970
I'll be right behind you.

924
01:23:10,294 --> 01:23:12,481
You weren't gonna really
blow him up, were you?

925
01:23:12,711 --> 01:23:15,090
Of course not. That thing isn't loaded.

926
01:23:15,358 --> 01:23:18,159
I just stuck that fake fuse in there.

927
01:23:20,576 --> 01:23:22,379
See?

928
01:23:49,160 --> 01:23:50,963
Wow!

929
01:23:56,335 --> 01:23:57,486
My business!

930
01:23:57,601 --> 01:24:03,126
I'll find out who's responsible for this
outrage if it's the last thing I ever do.

931
01:24:05,428 --> 01:24:08,344
Disturbin' the peace, that's what it is.

932
01:24:09,571 --> 01:24:11,874
I don't care if you are
cleanin' up this town.

933
01:24:12,180 --> 01:24:14,943
That was a terrible thing to do
to them unfortunate girls.

934
01:24:15,327 --> 01:24:16,861
I didn't know it was loaded.

935
01:24:17,053 --> 01:24:20,506
I never done anything
to an unfortunate girl in my life.

936
01:24:20,775 --> 01:24:24,727
Some of those girls
are the closest friends I got.

937
01:24:54,078 --> 01:24:56,380
Well, well, who have we here?
It's the sheriff.

938
01:24:56,572 --> 01:24:59,449
- It's the sheriff, boys.
- We know who it is.

939
01:24:59,756 --> 01:25:02,519
Everybody knows
who our sheriff is these days.

940
01:25:02,710 --> 01:25:08,082
Devery's right. You're the most popular
and respected citizen we've got here.

941
01:25:08,350 --> 01:25:10,000
That's nice to hear.

942
01:25:10,192 --> 01:25:14,412
We're sendin' a delegation to Washington
about turning this territory into a state.

943
01:25:14,719 --> 01:25:17,559
- We'd be proud if you'd head it.
- No, no.

944
01:25:17,789 --> 01:25:19,784
You want somebody who will be here.

945
01:25:19,976 --> 01:25:23,697
Now, Jason, if you're upset with us
about that Danby business...

946
01:25:24,004 --> 01:25:28,532
- We were behind you all the way.
- It might not have looked that way.

947
01:25:28,915 --> 01:25:31,294
No, that's not it. It's just that...

948
01:25:31,486 --> 01:25:36,090
I've never made any secret of the fact
that I'm on my way to Australia.

949
01:25:36,359 --> 01:25:39,927
Which reminds me, I'm gonna have
to think about getting started again.

950
01:25:57,960 --> 01:26:03,600
Would you excuse me, gentlemen?
A small crisis needs to be handled.

951
01:26:05,825 --> 01:26:08,050
Jump, Miss Prudy. Jump.

952
01:26:21,095 --> 01:26:23,474
Boys, I just want you to know

953
01:26:23,666 --> 01:26:27,119
that from now on when you pick on
this lady, you'll be pickin' on my girl.

954
01:26:27,387 --> 01:26:29,996
We didn't have any idea
the wind blew that way.

955
01:26:30,303 --> 01:26:34,217
- Now you know. Spread the word around.
- Yes, sir.

956
01:26:36,058 --> 01:26:37,747
What do you mean, your girl?

957
01:26:37,977 --> 01:26:41,315
Prudy, for once in your life, play it smart
and keep your big mouth shut.

958
01:26:41,583 --> 01:26:44,576
You keep out of this.
What do you mean, your girl?

959
01:26:44,768 --> 01:26:48,605
Come on, you've had that look in your eye
since the first day I hit town.

960
01:26:48,988 --> 01:26:52,710
We're gonna have an agreement. After
we're married, no matter how many kids,

961
01:26:53,017 --> 01:26:57,237
when I say we're off to Australia,
we pack up, kids and all, and off we go.

962
01:26:57,621 --> 01:26:59,539
What do I wanna go to Australia for?

963
01:26:59,731 --> 01:27:04,143
That's where your husband would be.
Girls usually go where their husbands are.

964
01:27:04,527 --> 01:27:06,369
Oh...

965
01:27:08,172 --> 01:27:12,661
Well, when you put it that way...
Why don't you put me down?

966
01:27:13,927 --> 01:27:16,114
I like it like this.

967
01:27:16,344 --> 01:27:18,416
You want me to walk you home?

968
01:27:20,181 --> 01:27:21,792
If you want to, Sheriff.

969
01:27:24,171 --> 01:27:25,629
Say...

970
01:27:25,821 --> 01:27:29,006
Are you really one of the richest girls
in this part of the country?

971
01:27:29,274 --> 01:27:31,845
- The richest.
- That's nice.

972
01:27:32,228 --> 01:27:34,147
That's real nice.

973
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:42,895
The way this story ends
is that they get married

974
01:27:43,202 --> 01:27:47,115
and he goes on to become
governor of the state.

975
01:27:47,499 --> 01:27:51,796
He never gets to Australia, but he keeps
reading a lot of books about it.

976
01:27:52,180 --> 01:27:55,095
I get to be sheriff of this town.

977
01:27:55,364 --> 01:28:01,388
Then I go on to become one of the most
beloved characters in Western folklore.

978
01:28:49,194 --> 01:28:51,649
