00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:03,760
Apartment For Rent

2
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:18,483
- A phone token, please.
- No tokens. At the end, on the left.

3
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:13,121
Maman? Yes, it's Jeanne.

4
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:16,792
I've found a flat to rent in Passy.
I'm going to see it.

5
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:20,754
Then I've got to go to the station
to meet Tom. I promised him.

6
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:24,257
OK, see you later. Bye!

7
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:30,806
I've come to see the flat.
I saw the sign.

8
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:33,767
- The sign?
- Yes.

9
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:37,604
It's always the same!
Nobody ever tells me anything.

10
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:40,315
- I'd like to see it.
- You want to rent it?

11
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:43,652
- I don't know yet!
- They rent, they leave...

12
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,987
..and I'm the last to know.

13
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:49,157
Do you think that's right?

14
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:52,160
If you want to go up alone...

15
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:54,788
...go on. I'm afraid of spiders.

16
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:59,042
The key is missing.

17
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:01,253
Strange things happen.

18
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:07,676
They drink six bottles a day.

19
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:15,559
Wait! Don't go!
There must be a duplicate.

20
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,193
Here it is.

21
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:27,446
You must be very young.

22
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:31,700
Let go of me!

23
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,042
She's crazy!

24
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:36,932
Who are you?

25
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:43,021
You gave me a fright.
How did you get in?

26
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:48,693
- Through the door.
- Oh, yes. I left it open.

27
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,946
I didn't hear you come in.

28
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,950
- I was already here.
- Sorry?

29
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:59,329
Oh, it was you who took it.

30
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:01,831
I had to bribe the concierge.

31
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:09,256
These old houses are fascinating.

32
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:18,598
An armchair by the fireplace
would look good.

33
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,478
The armchair should go...

34
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:26,147
..in front of the window.

35
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:28,441
Are you American?

36
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:33,321
You've got an American accent.

37
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,172
- Are you going to take it?
- Are you?

38
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,550
I don't know.

39
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:15,382
Oh là là!

40
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,464
Do I answer it or not?

41
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,603
There's no one!

42
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,690
I don't know.

43
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:01,362
So you're going to take it?
You've decided?

44
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,869
I had already decided.

45
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:11,498
But I'm not sure now.

46
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:16,377
Do you like it?

47
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,838
Do you like it?!

48
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:21,883
I don't know.
I shall have to think about it.

49
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:31,518
Think fast.

50
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,703
I thought you'd left.

51
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:22,016
- Watch out!
- Have they taken us for someone else?

52
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:24,310
We're in a film. We're in a film.

53
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:26,437
If I kiss you...

54
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:27,939
...it might be cinema.

55
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,149
If I stroke your hair...

56
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:32,026
...it might be cinema.

57
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:34,737
What's going on? Do you know them?

58
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:38,032
It's a long story.
In short, Portrait of a Girl.

59
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:42,286
It's been accepted for television!
And the girl is you. It's you!

60
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:45,123
You're mad!
You might have asked me first.

61
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,500
Yeah, but I wanted...

62
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:51,462
I wanted to start with shots of Jeanne
at the station meeting her fiancé.

63
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,631
Yes, I know them. They're my crew.

64
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,758
So you kissed me...

65
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:58,052
...and you knew it was being filmed.

66
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:01,180
You're a bastard! Traitor!

67
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:04,142
No, you'll see. It will be a love story.

68
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:10,273
Tell me, Jeanne, darling.
What did you do while I was away?

69
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,526
I thought of you day and night,
and I cried.

70
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:15,862
Darling, I can't live without you!

71
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:18,739
Wonderful! Cut! That was perfect!

72
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:30,251
I'd have finished by now...

73
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:33,087
...but the police
wouldn't let me touch anything.

74
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:37,508
They didn't believe it was suicide.
There was so much blood everywhere.

75
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:43,264
They had fun
making me do a reconstruction.

76
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,106
"She went there."

77
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:57,904
"She came through here."

78
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:03,743
"She opened the curtain."

79
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:06,245
I copied all her actions.

80
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:08,789
The guests were awake all night!

81
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,918
The hotel was crawling with cops!

82
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:15,296
They enjoy playing around with blood.

83
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:29,060
They were all spies!

84
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:32,772
Asking if she was sad,
if she was happy...

85
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,857
...if you fought...

86
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:39,612
...how long you'd been married,
why you didn't have any children.

87
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:43,074
Pigs!

88
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:47,870
They got familiar right away!

89
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:51,791
They said,
"Your boss is a bit unstable."

90
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:56,754
"Do you know that he was a boxer?"

91
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:59,006
So?

92
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:03,052
"It didn't work out...

93
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:05,888
...so he became...

94
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:08,557
...an actor."

95
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,186
"Bongo player...

96
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:20,069
...revolutionary in South America...

97
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:22,363
...journalist in Japan."

98
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:25,491
"One day, he lands in Tahiti...

99
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,494
...hangs around...

100
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:31,372
...learns French."

101
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:35,710
"Then he comes to Paris. There...

102
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:44,051
...he meets a woman with money,
marries her and..."

103
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:47,722
"Since then what has your boss done?"

104
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:50,016
"Nothing."

105
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:55,563
I say, "Can I clean up now?"

106
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:59,608
"No! Don't touch anything!"

107
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:03,404
"Do you really think
she killed herself?"

108
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:07,950
He pushed me into a corner
and tried to paw me...

109
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,746
Turn the tap off now.

110
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:14,915
They'll be doing the autopsy right now.

111
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,921
Why won't you turn the tap off?

112
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:23,841
They told me
to give you your razor back.

113
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:29,555
It's not mine.

114
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:33,642
They said they don't need it anymore.
The investigation is over.

115
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:37,438
Yes, she had cuts there...

116
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:38,773
...and on the neck, too...

117
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:58,352
Excuse me,
where shall I put this?

118
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:02,440
- You could have rung the bell.
- The door was open. I'll put it there.

119
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:05,401
In front of the fireplace.

120
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:10,030
- Careful, Madame.
- There.

121
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:19,165
- What about the table?
- How do I know? He'll decide.

122
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:26,046
- This is a king-size!
- It won't fit.

123
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:31,385
Well, your husband has no idea.
All this in an hour... It's not long.

124
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:39,268
What a mess!

125
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:41,520
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

126
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:53,199
The armchair goes
in front of the window.

127
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:55,201
Like that.

128
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:57,703
But I only came to return the key.

129
00:24:57,871 --> 00:25:00,581
- To return it to you.
- I don't care about the key.

130
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:02,833
Take your coat off.

131
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:06,754
Take your coat off and help me.

132
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,590
OK.

133
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:14,345
Get those chairs and bring them here.

134
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:20,100
Put them on the other side.

135
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:23,604
Take that, too.

136
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:25,981
That's it.

137
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:31,237
You didn't waste any time.

138
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:37,535
Listen, monsieur!

139
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:39,537
I've got to go.

140
00:27:57,550 --> 00:28:01,178
- I thought you'd be here.
- I expected you later.

141
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:09,269
I took the first train.

142
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:13,774
Oh, Paul! How awful! How awful, Paul!

143
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:40,134
Papa is in bed with asthma.

144
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:46,724
The doctor wouldn't let him come.

145
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:49,309
It's better like that.

146
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:51,937
I'm stronger.

147
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:15,252
What are you looking for?

148
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,838
Something that would explain...

149
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:20,174
- A letter, a clue.
- Nothing.

150
00:29:22,802 --> 00:29:26,054
I told you,
there's nothing, nothing at all.

151
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:34,980
My little Rosa wouldn't have...

152
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:38,150
Nothing for her mother. Not a word.

153
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:40,652
It's useless to keep on searching.

154
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,532
Not even for you, her husband!

155
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:56,293
You need to rest.

156
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:01,215
I think room 12 is free.

157
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:31,578
With a razor?

158
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,586
What time did it happen?

159
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:44,758
I don't know. In the evening.

160
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:49,221
And then?

161
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:54,560
Then I...
I already told you on the phone...

162
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:56,812
When I found her...

163
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:02,317
...I called the ambulance.

164
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:06,113
After you called...

165
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:09,283
...Papa and I stayed up all night...

166
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:11,994
...talking about Rosa and you.

167
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,830
Papa kept whispering...

168
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:19,126
...as if it had happened in our house.

169
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:20,794
Paul!

170
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:37,477
- Where did it happen?
- In one of the rooms.

171
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:39,354
Did she suffer?

172
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:42,441
Ask the doctors.
They're doing the autopsy.

173
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:44,651
The autopsy.

174
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:18,602
I already had some announcement cards.

175
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:21,021
I've seen a lot of death.

176
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:23,690
I think of everything.

177
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:29,446
I'll prepare her
a beautiful room with flowers.

178
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:34,910
The cards...

179
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:37,621
...clothes, relatives, flowers.

180
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:42,209
You've got everything in that suitcase.

181
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:44,795
You didn't forget anything.

182
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:48,340
But I don't want any priests here.

183
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:50,384
- But...
- No priests.

184
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:52,678
- But, Paul...
- Understand?

185
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:55,430
We have to.
Funerals must be religious.

186
00:32:55,598 --> 00:32:57,224
No!

187
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:59,393
Rosa didn't believe.

188
00:33:03,564 --> 00:33:07,567
Paul, don't shout.
Don't talk like that.

189
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:19,454
They'll give her absolution.

190
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:23,750
Absolution and a nice mass.
That's all I ask, Paul.

191
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:27,546
Rosa... Rosa is my little girl,
do you understand?

192
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:31,216
Rosa... Why did she kill herself?

193
00:33:32,468 --> 00:33:36,096
Why? Why did she commit suicide?

194
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:41,018
Why?

195
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:52,904
You don't know, huh?

196
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,949
You don't know.

197
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:20,380
You shouldn't have done that to me.

198
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:24,050
It's not a wig, it's my hair.

199
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:35,228
Doesn't it suit me?
Tell me, don't you like it? Tell me.

200
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:37,355
Of course I like it.

201
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:40,191
Listen, you know...

202
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:42,736
I don't know.

203
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:45,864
You have changed, and yet you haven't.

204
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:48,491
I can see the shot now.

205
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:50,994
The camera is up high.

206
00:38:51,203 --> 00:38:53,913
It descends slowly and follows you.

207
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:56,791
You come forward,
and it moves in on you.

208
00:38:57,293 --> 00:38:59,377
There's music, too.

209
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:04,466
It gets closer and closer to you.

210
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:07,594
I'm in a hurry. Let's start.

211
00:39:08,971 --> 00:39:11,056
But...

212
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:13,725
...can't we talk a little first?

213
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:16,686
Tonight we improvise.

214
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:18,938
You follow.

215
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:33,078
He was my childhood friend.

216
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:37,457
He used to watch me for hours and hours.
I think he understood me.

217
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:41,294
Dogs are worth more than people.
Much more.

218
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:44,923
Meet Olympia, my nanny.

219
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:48,176
Mustapha could always tell
the poor from the rich.

220
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:52,305
If someone well-dressed came in,
he never stirred.

221
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:56,559
But if someone scruffy came in,
you should have seen him! What a dog!

222
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:59,854
The colonel trained him
to recognize Arabs by their scent.

223
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:03,650
- Olympia, open the front door.
- Give me a kiss.

224
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:07,695
Go and open it.

225
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:10,281
Olympia is a compendium
of domestic virtues.

226
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:12,951
Faithful, admiring, and racist.

227
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:20,291
After Papa died, we moved back
to the family home for a while.

228
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:22,669
My childhood was made up of smells.

229
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:25,630
Musty smells,
the smell of walls and rooms.

230
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:29,968
Children used to come and play
in my jungle, all day long.

231
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:33,430
Growing old is a crime.

232
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:35,640
That's me there.

233
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:39,352
And that's Mademoiselle Sauvage,
the teacher.

234
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,021
She was very strict...
and very religious.

235
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:44,524
She was too good. She spoilt you.

236
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:47,360
That's Christine...

237
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:49,529
...my best friend.

238
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:52,407
She married the pharmacist
and has two children.

239
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:54,951
It's like a village here.
We all know each other.

240
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,203
I couldn't live in Paris.

241
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:00,707
We're safe here.

242
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:03,877
- It's odd looking at the past.
- Cut!

243
00:41:04,044 --> 00:41:07,505
Why is it odd? It's you!
It's fantastic, it's your childhood.

244
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:10,091
It's everything I was looking for.

245
00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:13,219
What are you up to? Move it! Move it!

246
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:16,890
Who are these zombies who are
always following you around? Scoot!

247
00:41:17,057 --> 00:41:19,726
Go on! The door, the door...

248
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:21,978
I'm opening the door.

249
00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:24,355
I'm opening all the doors.

250
00:41:24,523 --> 00:41:27,567
- What are you doing?
- Setting up my shot.

251
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:30,528
There it is! That's it! I've found it.

252
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:33,406
Reverse gear!

253
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:36,075
What are you doing there?

254
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:37,827
Beat it!

255
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:41,414
That's it. Into reverse. Yes!

256
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:46,419
Do you see?
Like a car, you go into reverse gear.

257
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:49,422
That's it. Close your eyes.

258
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:52,592
Start reversing. Close your eyes.

259
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:56,554
That's it, come on.
Come on backwards.

260
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:59,766
That's it.
Go back to your childhood.

261
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:02,268
- Papa?
- You're soaring.

262
00:42:02,436 --> 00:42:06,773
- Take off and return to your childhood.
- In full uniform.

263
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:09,442
Don't be afraid. Overcome the obstacles.

264
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:11,778
Papa in Algeria.

265
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:14,113
You're 15.

266
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:16,282
14...

267
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:18,535
...13...12...

268
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:21,871
...11...10...9.

269
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:26,626
- We're there.
- My favorite route when I was eight.

270
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,926
My old notebook.

271
00:42:37,471 --> 00:42:40,848
French homework.
Theme: the countryside.

272
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:44,269
Exposition:
the countryside is cow country.

273
00:42:44,436 --> 00:42:46,771
The cow is all dressed in leather.

274
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:50,483
The cow has four sides:
the front, the back...

275
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,529
...the top and the bottom.

276
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:56,656
- Isn't that good?
- Beastly!

277
00:42:56,824 --> 00:43:00,159
Here are my cultural sources.
Le Grand Larousse.

278
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:02,453
I just copied from it.

279
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:06,040
Menstruation. Noun.

280
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:10,587
Physiological function
comprising the discharge of menses.

281
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:12,714
Penis. Noun.

282
00:43:12,881 --> 00:43:16,843
Male copulation organ,
measuring five to forty centimeters.

283
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:19,012
That's Le Petit Robert.

284
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:24,100
Tom! Look!

285
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:27,687
- Who's that?
- My first love.

286
00:43:27,896 --> 00:43:30,523
- Who?
- My cousin Paul. My first love.

287
00:43:31,233 --> 00:43:33,359
- But his eyes are closed.
- What?

288
00:43:33,527 --> 00:43:37,196
- His eyes are closed!
- He played the piano divinely.

289
00:43:37,364 --> 00:43:39,240
That's how I remember him.

290
00:43:39,408 --> 00:43:41,409
Sitting at the piano...

291
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:43,703
His fingers would skim the keys.

292
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:45,997
He played for hours and hours.

293
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:51,336
At the bottom of the garden,
there were two big trees.

294
00:43:51,503 --> 00:43:53,713
A plane tree and a chestnut tree.

295
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:57,717
After mass on Sundays,
we used to sit there...

296
00:43:57,885 --> 00:43:59,969
...each under our own tree.

297
00:44:00,846 --> 00:44:04,390
It was wonderful.
We sat gazing into each other's eyes.

298
00:44:04,558 --> 00:44:07,852
Aren't my trees beautiful?
They were my jungle.

299
00:44:09,938 --> 00:44:12,315
- What are you doing?
- Having a shit.

300
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:14,233
No, we're doing a poo.

301
00:44:14,401 --> 00:44:18,196
- Shame on you, doing it in my jungle!
- Watch out! Run for it!

302
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:21,908
Oh, these dirty little Arabs!
Go and shit in your own country!

303
00:44:23,702 --> 00:44:25,828
Keep filming. Keep filming!

304
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:29,165
Don't stop, whatever you do!

305
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,800
- Did you get it?
- Everything.

306
00:44:38,967 --> 00:44:40,385
Olympia was great.

307
00:44:40,552 --> 00:44:43,471
It'll give a good idea of race relations
in the suburbs of Paris.

308
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:45,640
It's a real jungle here.

309
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:47,767
So, tell me about your father.

310
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:50,353
- I thought we'd finished.
- Five minutes.

311
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:53,731
- I'm meeting someone for work.
- But the colonel...

312
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:59,237
The colonel had green eyes
and shiny boots.

313
00:44:59,988 --> 00:45:01,948
I worshipped him.

314
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:04,367
He was so handsome in his uniform.

315
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:10,206
What? Don't...

316
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:27,807
He died in Algeria in '58.

317
00:45:32,312 --> 00:45:35,314
'58.
And don't joke about things like that.

318
00:55:28,033 --> 00:55:30,617
Why aren't you listening to me?

319
00:55:35,707 --> 00:55:37,750
The first time?

320
00:55:38,293 --> 00:55:40,919
I was really late for school.

321
00:55:41,087 --> 00:55:44,173
I started running and it was downhill.

322
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:48,802
All of a sudden,
I felt a strong sensation here.

323
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:51,430
So I ran and ran...

324
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:53,557
...and I came as I ran.

325
00:55:53,725 --> 00:55:56,894
The faster I ran, the better it was
and the more I came.

326
00:55:57,604 --> 00:56:00,439
A couple of days later,
I tried to do it again...

327
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:02,816
...but no luck.

328
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:10,783
Why aren't you listening to me?

329
00:56:12,118 --> 00:56:15,954
Why do I feel like I'm talking
to a brick wall when I talk to you?

330
00:56:16,122 --> 00:56:18,082
Your solitude weighs on me.

331
00:56:18,249 --> 00:56:20,709
It isn't indulgent. It isn't generous.

332
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:22,961
You are selfish!

333
00:59:16,803 --> 00:59:19,096
I can't sleep with this music.

334
00:59:20,598 --> 00:59:24,476
I came to this hotel a long time ago,
to spend one night.

335
00:59:24,644 --> 00:59:26,728
And I stayed for five years.

336
00:59:27,188 --> 00:59:29,523
When Papa and I had the hotel...

337
00:59:29,691 --> 00:59:31,733
...people came here to sleep.

338
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:33,986
Now, there's all sorts.

339
00:59:34,946 --> 00:59:39,241
They can hide, take drugs, play music.

340
00:59:44,497 --> 00:59:46,498
Take your hand away.

341
00:59:46,666 --> 00:59:49,251
You're not alone, Paul. I'm here.

342
00:59:55,091 --> 00:59:56,550
You're crazy!

343
00:59:56,718 --> 00:59:58,719
I'm starting to understand.

344
00:59:58,886 --> 01:00:01,346
Do you want me to make them shut up?

345
01:00:07,228 --> 01:00:09,479
- What are you doing, Paul?
- I'm afraid!

346
01:00:24,746 --> 01:00:25,829
Put the light on!

347
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:53,023
The light, Paul.

348
01:01:28,935 --> 01:01:31,561
- Good evening, Madame.
- Good evening.

349
01:01:36,192 --> 01:01:38,276
Good evening, Marcel.

350
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:41,405
Goodnight, Paul.

351
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:54,626
Who's that?

352
01:01:54,794 --> 01:01:56,753
Do you like him?

353
01:01:56,921 --> 01:01:58,964
He was Rosa's lover.

354
01:05:58,204 --> 01:06:00,038
Again!

355
01:06:07,588 --> 01:06:09,923
I'm coming! I'm ready.

356
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:13,385
Shall we leave together?

357
01:06:21,644 --> 01:06:23,228
Bastard!

358
01:06:23,396 --> 01:06:25,563
He's a git! Not even goodbye!

359
01:07:05,771 --> 01:07:09,024
What are you doing there?
I'm coming! I'll fly!

360
01:07:09,942 --> 01:07:13,945
- Wait! I've got to talk to you.
- Why didn't you speak on the phone?

361
01:07:14,113 --> 01:07:15,405
What's up?

362
01:07:15,573 --> 01:07:17,532
- You must find someone else.
- For what?

363
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:19,784
- For your film.
- Why?

364
01:07:20,536 --> 01:07:23,371
Because you're taking advantage of me.

365
01:07:23,539 --> 01:07:26,958
Because you make me do things
I've never done.

366
01:07:27,126 --> 01:07:29,335
Because you're taking up my time.

367
01:07:29,503 --> 01:07:32,088
You make me do whatever you want.

368
01:07:34,341 --> 01:07:36,301
The film is over!

369
01:07:46,645 --> 01:07:48,813
I'm tired of being raped!

370
01:08:37,738 --> 01:08:39,030
Come in!

371
01:08:39,198 --> 01:08:41,825
You wanted to talk to me. Go on, then.

372
01:08:43,869 --> 01:08:47,038
You know I haven't come
to cry with you, huh?

373
01:08:48,207 --> 01:08:50,542
Do you mind if I carry on working?

374
01:08:53,045 --> 01:08:56,256
It helps me a lot
after what has happened.

375
01:08:59,426 --> 01:09:01,427
Identical.

376
01:09:01,595 --> 01:09:03,555
Rosa wanted them identical.

377
01:09:03,722 --> 01:09:05,640
Our bathrobes, huh?

378
01:09:05,808 --> 01:09:09,602
You can't tell me anything
I don't already know, huh?

379
01:09:09,770 --> 01:09:12,021
Same color, same pattern.

380
01:09:13,983 --> 01:09:15,900
Yes, yes, yes.

381
01:09:18,028 --> 01:09:20,071
You're meticulous.

382
01:09:21,657 --> 01:09:26,578
I've always wondered why
you save newspaper clippings.

383
01:09:27,955 --> 01:09:29,956
Is it work? Or a hobby?

384
01:09:30,124 --> 01:09:33,376
Hobby? I don't like that word.

385
01:09:33,544 --> 01:09:37,255
Let's say it's some extra cash.
I do it for an agency.

386
01:09:37,423 --> 01:09:40,091
Oh, so it's serious.

387
01:09:40,801 --> 01:09:42,760
It's a job that makes you read, huh?

388
01:09:42,928 --> 01:09:45,054
Very educational.

389
01:09:46,390 --> 01:09:48,349
Be honest.

390
01:09:48,517 --> 01:09:51,269
You didn't know
we had the same bathrobes.

391
01:09:52,938 --> 01:09:55,064
Marcello.

392
01:09:57,067 --> 01:09:59,652
We've got a lot of things in common.

393
01:10:02,281 --> 01:10:04,449
Marcello, I know everything.

394
01:10:06,410 --> 01:10:09,204
No, Rosa often talked to me about you.

395
01:10:11,790 --> 01:10:15,919
I don't think there are
many marriages like that.

396
01:10:17,504 --> 01:10:19,589
It's strange.

397
01:10:22,843 --> 01:10:24,969
I'm thirsty.

398
01:10:28,349 --> 01:10:32,560
- Would you like a shot of bourbon?
- Hold on.

399
01:10:43,155 --> 01:10:45,198
Here's the bourbon.

400
01:10:50,663 --> 01:10:53,122
Was that a present from Rosa, too?

401
01:10:55,125 --> 01:10:57,293
I don't really like bourbon...

402
01:10:57,461 --> 01:11:01,297
...but Rosa wanted me
to keep a bottle here in my room.

403
01:11:08,597 --> 01:11:11,099
I was asking myself this question.

404
01:11:12,851 --> 01:11:15,103
If, with these little things...

405
01:11:15,271 --> 01:11:17,855
...unimportant things...

406
01:11:19,275 --> 01:11:23,403
...we could go back over things,
and understand together.

407
01:11:23,570 --> 01:11:25,488
Together?

408
01:11:25,656 --> 01:11:27,615
It's almost a year that Rosa and I...

409
01:11:27,783 --> 01:11:30,952
Not passionately, but regularly...

410
01:11:31,745 --> 01:11:34,414
I thought I knew her
as much as you can know...

411
01:11:34,581 --> 01:11:37,083
- Your mistress.
- For example...

412
01:11:38,168 --> 01:11:43,047
...a while ago, something happened
that I still don't understand.

413
01:11:45,926 --> 01:11:48,011
Do you see there, on the wall?

414
01:11:50,264 --> 01:11:52,849
She had climbed onto the bed...

415
01:11:54,727 --> 01:11:58,604
...and she was trying to tear at the
walls with her hands.

416
01:12:00,274 --> 01:12:04,027
I stopped her because
she was breaking her nails.

417
01:12:05,404 --> 01:12:09,574
She had a strange... violence about her.

418
01:12:11,118 --> 01:12:13,453
I'd never seen her like that.

419
01:12:15,748 --> 01:12:17,790
Our room is painted white.

420
01:12:18,751 --> 01:12:22,837
Rosa wanted it to be different
from the other rooms in the hotel.

421
01:12:23,005 --> 01:12:25,089
To make it look like...

422
01:12:26,675 --> 01:12:28,760
...a more normal home.

423
01:12:29,219 --> 01:12:30,845
But...

424
01:12:31,013 --> 01:12:33,097
...it had to be changed here, too.

425
01:12:34,433 --> 01:12:37,018
I think she started with the wall.

426
01:12:41,523 --> 01:12:43,941
A cold sore. I don't know. Shit.

427
01:12:47,905 --> 01:12:49,989
You're lucky, huh?

428
01:12:50,949 --> 01:12:54,869
You were...
You must have been very handsome...

429
01:12:55,037 --> 01:12:57,121
...20 years ago.

430
01:12:59,291 --> 01:13:01,334
Not as much as you.

431
01:13:03,337 --> 01:13:05,588
You've still got all your hair.

432
01:13:05,756 --> 01:13:08,633
My hair... I have to
have it trimmed often.

433
01:13:08,801 --> 01:13:11,636
And wash it. I wash it nearly every day.

434
01:13:12,096 --> 01:13:14,180
Don't you have massages?

435
01:13:15,641 --> 01:13:17,642
Yes, I do.

436
01:13:17,810 --> 01:13:19,894
You're in good shape.

437
01:13:20,479 --> 01:13:24,065
What do you do for... your stomach?

438
01:13:24,233 --> 01:13:26,317
That's my problem.

439
01:13:27,319 --> 01:13:31,072
For that... I have a secret.

440
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:33,324
Tell me!

441
01:13:40,874 --> 01:13:44,752
Are you leaving us?
I saw your suitcase was packed.

442
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:47,338
America.

443
01:13:47,506 --> 01:13:49,757
Why was she unfaithful to you?

444
01:13:49,925 --> 01:13:51,884
You can't believe that Rosa...

445
01:13:52,594 --> 01:13:54,220
...killed herself.

446
01:13:57,516 --> 01:13:59,475
It's hard for me to...

447
01:13:59,643 --> 01:14:01,853
...believe, too.

448
01:14:03,981 --> 01:14:06,065
This is my secret!

449
01:14:06,942 --> 01:14:09,444
Thirty times every morning.

450
01:14:31,049 --> 01:14:33,134
Are you in?

451
01:14:36,054 --> 01:14:38,097
Is anyone here?

452
01:14:48,942 --> 01:14:51,068
Hi, monster.

453
01:15:04,708 --> 01:15:06,792
Is something wrong?

454
01:15:36,782 --> 01:15:38,783
Do you really think...

455
01:15:38,951 --> 01:15:42,495
...that an American sitting
on the floor in an empty flat...

456
01:15:42,663 --> 01:15:45,790
...eating cheese and drinking water
is interesting?

457
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:50,920
There's something under here.
Can you hear it?

458
01:15:51,088 --> 01:15:53,256
It's hollow.

459
01:16:54,359 --> 01:16:56,235
What are you doing?

460
01:19:31,183 --> 01:19:33,225
Shit!

461
01:21:07,279 --> 01:21:10,406
Do you know why
I sent the others away?

462
01:21:10,574 --> 01:21:13,701
Because you're angry,
or you want to be alone with me?

463
01:21:13,869 --> 01:21:16,161
And why do I want to be alone with you?

464
01:21:16,329 --> 01:21:18,789
You have something
really serious to tell me.

465
01:21:18,957 --> 01:21:21,917
I have something really
very serious to tell you.

466
01:21:22,544 --> 01:21:25,921
- Is it happy or sad?
- It's a secret.

467
01:21:26,089 --> 01:21:28,799
So it's happy.
What sort of secret?

468
01:21:28,967 --> 01:21:32,094
- A secret...
- Speak up! I can't hear anything.

469
01:21:32,262 --> 01:21:35,472
- ...between a man and a woman.
- Is it dirty or is it about love?

470
01:21:36,516 --> 01:21:38,559
About love. But that's not all.

471
01:21:38,727 --> 01:21:41,437
A secret about love,
but which isn't love.

472
01:21:41,605 --> 01:21:43,689
What is it?!

473
01:21:46,109 --> 01:21:48,652
That in a week I'm marrying you.

474
01:21:48,820 --> 01:21:50,946
- What?
- I'm marrying you.

475
01:21:51,114 --> 01:21:53,115
- What?!
- I'm marrying you!

476
01:21:53,283 --> 01:21:54,909
- You're marrying me?
- Yes!

477
01:21:55,076 --> 01:21:56,702
- We're getting married?
- Yes.

478
01:21:56,870 --> 01:21:57,995
- No?
- Yes.

479
01:21:58,163 --> 01:21:59,163
- No!
- Yes.

480
01:21:59,331 --> 01:22:00,289
- Yes?
- Yes.

481
01:22:00,457 --> 01:22:02,249
- No.
- Yes.

482
01:22:02,417 --> 01:22:03,709
- Yes?
- No.

483
01:22:03,877 --> 01:22:06,462
- Are we getting married or not?
- I don't know.

484
01:22:06,630 --> 01:22:08,005
- So, yes, then?
- Yes!

485
01:22:08,173 --> 01:22:09,465
- No!
- Yes!

486
01:22:09,633 --> 01:22:11,508
- Yes.
- No.

487
01:22:11,676 --> 01:22:13,719
Yes or no?

488
01:22:22,187 --> 01:22:24,647
Of course,
I'll send everything to the country.

489
01:22:24,814 --> 01:22:26,690
What do you think, Jeanne?

490
01:22:26,858 --> 01:22:28,943
Olympia will be happy.

491
01:22:29,736 --> 01:22:32,071
I went there yesterday with Tom.

492
01:22:34,741 --> 01:22:37,201
She's preparing a family museum.

493
01:22:38,995 --> 01:22:43,374
Of course, I'm not sending the boots.
I'm keeping them with me.

494
01:22:44,209 --> 01:22:46,627
I get strange shivers when I touch them.

495
01:22:52,384 --> 01:22:55,886
All these military things never age.

496
01:22:57,681 --> 01:23:00,057
When I was little,
it seemed really heavy...

497
01:23:00,225 --> 01:23:02,226
...when Papa taught me how to shoot.

498
01:23:02,394 --> 01:23:04,228
I'm keeping that here.

499
01:23:04,396 --> 01:23:08,023
In a respectable household,
it's useful to have a weapon.

500
01:23:08,191 --> 01:23:09,733
You don't even know how to use it.

501
01:23:09,901 --> 01:23:14,238
The important thing is to have one.
It makes an impression.

502
01:23:18,410 --> 01:23:21,078
You really kept everything of Papa's.

503
01:23:21,705 --> 01:23:23,998
Who's that? His orderly?

504
01:23:26,084 --> 01:23:28,252
A fine example of a Berber.

505
01:23:28,420 --> 01:23:33,549
A strong race. I tried to employ them
as servants, but it was disastrous.

506
01:23:33,717 --> 01:23:37,302
I'm glad I decided to send everything
to the country.

507
01:23:37,470 --> 01:23:40,222
All his things were
piling up and piling up.

508
01:23:40,390 --> 01:23:43,434
Don't worry.
You'll soon have all the space you want.

509
01:23:43,601 --> 01:23:45,602
What does that mean?

510
01:23:45,770 --> 01:23:47,646
Nothing.

511
01:23:50,066 --> 01:23:51,859
Madame, the colonel's lady...

512
01:23:52,027 --> 01:23:53,944
...I announce...

513
01:23:54,112 --> 01:23:57,281
What? What?

514
01:23:57,449 --> 01:23:59,533
On this solemn day...

515
01:24:00,201 --> 01:24:02,202
What? What solemn day?

516
01:24:02,370 --> 01:24:04,538
I'm getting married in a week!

517
01:24:05,498 --> 01:24:08,500
- What did you say?
- To Tom! In a week!

518
01:24:08,668 --> 01:24:11,128
- Pardon?
- Tom!

519
01:24:11,296 --> 01:24:14,381
- In a week!
- What are you doing in a week?

520
01:24:14,966 --> 01:24:17,384
Five... two!

521
01:24:20,597 --> 01:24:23,348
Move into shot! We're shooting!

522
01:24:27,270 --> 01:24:30,355
So... how do you see marriage?

523
01:24:31,274 --> 01:24:32,858
- Marriage?
- Yes.

524
01:24:33,026 --> 01:24:35,527
I see it everywhere. All the time.

525
01:24:35,695 --> 01:24:37,654
What do you mean, everywhere?

526
01:24:37,822 --> 01:24:41,950
- On walls. On buildings.
- Walls and buildings?

527
01:24:42,118 --> 01:24:45,496
Yes, on advertising hoardings.
What are they selling?

528
01:24:45,663 --> 01:24:49,583
Cars. Tinned meat. Cigarettes.

529
01:24:49,751 --> 01:24:52,211
No. They're all about young couples.

530
01:24:52,378 --> 01:24:54,588
Before marriage, no children.

531
01:24:54,756 --> 01:24:57,674
Then the same couple,
married with children.

532
01:24:57,842 --> 01:24:59,510
In short, marriage.

533
01:24:59,677 --> 01:25:02,137
The perfect, ideal, successful marriage.

534
01:25:02,305 --> 01:25:04,723
It's no longer
the preserve of the Church.

535
01:25:04,891 --> 01:25:08,727
The husband was burdened with
responsibilities and the wife nagged.

536
01:25:08,895 --> 01:25:10,979
Now, weddings in advertising smile!

537
01:25:11,147 --> 01:25:14,024
They smile. On posters.

538
01:25:14,192 --> 01:25:18,403
On posters, of course. But why
not take poster marriage seriously?

539
01:25:18,571 --> 01:25:20,697
Marriage... Pop marriage!

540
01:25:22,867 --> 01:25:25,869
Pop? That's the formula.

541
01:25:26,329 --> 01:25:29,915
For pop youth, pop marriage!

542
01:25:30,083 --> 01:25:34,044
But... what if the pop marriage
doesn't work?

543
01:25:34,212 --> 01:25:37,047
Then you have to fix it
like you would a car.

544
01:25:37,215 --> 01:25:40,008
The spouses are two workers
in overalls...

545
01:25:40,176 --> 01:25:42,177
...bending over an engine to fix it.

546
01:25:42,345 --> 01:25:45,889
And in case of adultery
what happens to the pop marriage?

547
01:25:46,057 --> 01:25:48,892
In that case,
there are three or four workers.

548
01:25:49,894 --> 01:25:51,895
What about love?

549
01:25:52,063 --> 01:25:53,897
Is love pop?

550
01:25:54,065 --> 01:25:55,899
No. That's not. Love isn't pop.

551
01:25:56,067 --> 01:25:58,277
Love isn't pop. So what is it?

552
01:25:59,654 --> 01:26:02,156
The workers retire to a secret flat...

553
01:26:02,323 --> 01:26:06,118
...take off their overalls
and become men and women again...

554
01:26:06,286 --> 01:26:07,995
...and make love.

555
01:26:20,758 --> 01:26:22,759
You're wonderful.

556
01:26:22,927 --> 01:26:25,012
It's the dress that makes the bride.

557
01:26:26,556 --> 01:26:29,016
You're better than Rita Hayworth.

558
01:26:29,184 --> 01:26:31,268
Better than Joan Crawford!

559
01:26:32,312 --> 01:26:34,438
Better than Kim Novak!

560
01:26:34,606 --> 01:26:36,607
Better than Lauren Bacall!

561
01:26:36,774 --> 01:26:38,775
Better than Ava Gardner...

562
01:26:38,943 --> 01:26:41,236
...when she was Mickey Rooney's lover!

563
01:26:41,404 --> 01:26:44,948
What are you doing?
Stop! Stop, but keep filming!

564
01:26:45,116 --> 01:26:48,410
Why aren't you filming in the rain?
You're crazy!

565
01:26:58,504 --> 01:27:00,964
- Where's Jeanne?
- She must have run off.

566
01:27:01,132 --> 01:27:03,175
When? In the rain?

567
01:27:34,249 --> 01:27:36,250
Please forgive me!

568
01:27:40,213 --> 01:27:42,798
I wanted to leave you and I couldn't.

569
01:27:50,056 --> 01:27:52,766
I can't leave you, do you understand?

570
01:27:52,934 --> 01:27:55,018
Do you still want me?

571
01:28:24,382 --> 01:28:26,466
Voilà!

572
01:30:01,896 --> 01:30:04,606
I want to get out of here.
I want to go.

573
01:30:05,274 --> 01:30:07,484
I can't stand it here anymore.

574
01:30:09,237 --> 01:30:11,321
Yes. I'm going.

575
01:30:12,615 --> 01:30:14,574
I'm not coming back...

576
01:30:14,742 --> 01:30:16,827
...ever.

577
01:30:18,913 --> 01:30:20,997
Quo vadis, baby?

578
01:35:20,506 --> 01:35:21,715
What?

579
01:41:44,014 --> 01:41:46,307
Is anyone there?

580
01:41:49,478 --> 01:41:51,562
There was a noise in there!

581
01:42:15,295 --> 01:42:17,213
Well? Is anyone there?

582
01:42:22,719 --> 01:42:24,846
Here he is. Hurry up!

583
01:42:25,639 --> 01:42:27,598
Wake up!

584
01:42:27,766 --> 01:42:30,518
- Open up! Open up!
- It's four in the morning.

585
01:42:30,686 --> 01:42:32,770
I need room four for a while.

586
01:42:34,148 --> 01:42:36,858
Half an hour? Yes, that'll do.

587
01:42:37,025 --> 01:42:38,693
Yes, half an hour.

588
01:42:38,861 --> 01:42:41,320
- We're full.
- That's not true.

589
01:42:41,488 --> 01:42:44,282
When you're full,
you put a sign outside.

590
01:42:44,449 --> 01:42:46,284
I know the hotel.

591
01:42:46,451 --> 01:42:49,662
I'm sick of arguing out on the street.

592
01:42:49,830 --> 01:42:51,747
Call the owner.

593
01:42:51,915 --> 01:42:55,585
What are you waiting for?
The owner has never made a fuss.

594
01:42:55,752 --> 01:42:58,087
Rosa and I are old friends.

595
01:42:59,339 --> 01:43:01,424
Open up.

596
01:43:08,265 --> 01:43:10,850
Don't make any trouble
or I'll tell your boss.

597
01:43:11,018 --> 01:43:12,977
Come in, it's all sorted...

598
01:43:17,149 --> 01:43:19,275
You've won. He's taken off.

599
01:43:20,277 --> 01:43:22,278
I'm very sorry.

600
01:43:22,446 --> 01:43:25,323
Hurry up! He can't be far away.

601
01:43:28,327 --> 01:43:32,413
Make him come back.
Tell him he can't just walk off.

602
01:44:16,917 --> 01:44:19,835
Oh... please don't
tell her you found me.

603
01:44:20,003 --> 01:44:22,546
I don't fancy it any more.
Did you see her face?

604
01:44:22,714 --> 01:44:24,715
Once, my wife satisfied me.

605
01:44:24,883 --> 01:44:27,927
But now she's got a skin disease.
It's like snakeskin.

606
01:44:28,095 --> 01:44:31,597
- Put yourself in my place.
- Come. Come with me.

607
01:44:31,765 --> 01:44:34,100
But... let go of me!

608
01:44:37,437 --> 01:44:38,938
You're crazy!

609
01:44:40,023 --> 01:44:43,067
Let go of me! Let go!

610
01:46:22,209 --> 01:46:25,586
Try and remember!
The man from the fourth floor.

611
01:46:25,754 --> 01:46:27,755
He moved in a few days ago.

612
01:46:27,923 --> 01:46:30,257
I told you, I don't know anyone.

613
01:46:30,425 --> 01:46:34,303
They come and go. The man on
the fourth, the woman on the first.

614
01:46:34,513 --> 01:46:36,597
What do I know?

615
01:46:39,309 --> 01:46:42,144
Where did they take the furniture to?
It's empty.

616
01:46:42,312 --> 01:46:45,314
Where do you send his mail?
Give me his address.

617
01:46:45,482 --> 01:46:47,358
I don't have it.

618
01:46:50,153 --> 01:46:52,238
I don't know these people.

619
01:46:52,781 --> 01:46:55,449
- Not even his name?
- Nothing!

620
01:46:57,202 --> 01:46:59,120
Mam'zelle!

621
01:47:10,006 --> 01:47:12,091
I've found a flat for us.

622
01:47:13,301 --> 01:47:15,386
1, rue Jules Verne.

623
01:47:16,680 --> 01:47:18,764
Yes. In Passy.

624
01:47:20,600 --> 01:47:23,894
Come quickly! You'll come now?

625
01:47:25,063 --> 01:47:27,148
Do you know where it is?

626
01:47:28,150 --> 01:47:30,276
I'll wait for you. Come over.

627
01:47:53,049 --> 01:47:55,217
Come in, it's open.

628
01:47:57,262 --> 01:47:59,472
Do you like our flat?

629
01:47:59,639 --> 01:48:01,640
It's very light.

630
01:48:01,808 --> 01:48:05,311
There's a tiny room, too.
It's too small for a double bed.

631
01:48:05,729 --> 01:48:07,730
It would be fine for a child.

632
01:48:07,898 --> 01:48:10,316
Fidel. That's a nice name for a boy.

633
01:48:10,484 --> 01:48:12,485
Fidel, as in Castro.

634
01:48:12,652 --> 01:48:14,695
But I'd like a girl, too.

635
01:48:14,863 --> 01:48:17,323
Rosa. As in Rosa Luxemburg.

636
01:48:17,491 --> 01:48:20,034
Less famous, but I like it.

637
01:48:21,077 --> 01:48:23,120
You know...

638
01:48:23,705 --> 01:48:26,207
...I wanted to film you every day.

639
01:48:26,458 --> 01:48:28,751
In the morning, when you wake up...

640
01:48:28,919 --> 01:48:31,420
...in the evening, when you sleep.

641
01:48:31,588 --> 01:48:33,672
When you first smile...

642
01:48:35,675 --> 01:48:37,927
...and I didn't film any of that.

643
01:48:38,762 --> 01:48:40,846
Here.

644
01:48:44,309 --> 01:48:46,435
Today is the last day of shooting.

645
01:48:46,603 --> 01:48:48,604
The film is finished.

646
01:48:48,772 --> 01:48:51,899
I don't like things that finish,
things that end.

647
01:48:52,067 --> 01:48:54,777
You have to start
something else right away.

648
01:48:59,783 --> 01:49:01,784
This flat is huge!

649
01:49:01,952 --> 01:49:03,953
- Where are you?
- I'm here!

650
01:49:04,120 --> 01:49:07,957
- It's too big! We'll get lost!
- Stop it! Don't start!

651
01:49:08,124 --> 01:49:11,252
- How did you find this flat?
- By chance.

652
01:49:11,419 --> 01:49:14,421
- We'll change everything!
- Everything!

653
01:49:14,589 --> 01:49:16,507
We'll change chance to destiny.

654
01:49:16,675 --> 01:49:18,634
Go on, Jeanne. Take off!

655
01:49:18,802 --> 01:49:21,971
Fly away, you're in heaven!

656
01:49:22,138 --> 01:49:24,348
You're soaring, you're in heaven!

657
01:49:24,516 --> 01:49:26,976
Come down, take a nose dive,
come down!

658
01:49:28,979 --> 01:49:31,146
Make three turns, come down.

659
01:49:31,314 --> 01:49:34,900
Jeanne, what's happening?
There's an air pocket.

660
01:49:35,068 --> 01:49:37,152
What's happening?

661
01:49:39,698 --> 01:49:42,199
The patches of turbulence are over.

662
01:49:43,410 --> 01:49:46,328
We can't play like children
anymore, Jeanne.

663
01:49:50,166 --> 01:49:52,960
- We're adults.
- Adults? That's awful!

664
01:49:53,795 --> 01:49:55,838
Yes. It's awful.

665
01:49:58,049 --> 01:50:00,050
What do adults do?

666
01:50:00,218 --> 01:50:02,177
I don't know.

667
01:50:02,345 --> 01:50:05,848
We'll have to invent
the gestures and the words.

668
01:50:06,308 --> 01:50:08,350
For example, adults...

669
01:50:15,609 --> 01:50:17,776
But there's one thing I do know.

670
01:50:17,944 --> 01:50:21,030
Adults are calm, serious...

671
01:50:21,197 --> 01:50:24,199
...logical, measured, level-headed.

672
01:50:24,367 --> 01:50:25,492
Yes.

673
01:50:25,660 --> 01:50:29,204
- And... they face up to problems.
- Yes, yes. Yes, yes.

674
01:50:29,372 --> 01:50:32,541
You see, Jeanne,
this flat won't work for us.

675
01:50:32,709 --> 01:50:35,669
This flat, it won't work for us, Jeanne.

676
01:50:36,087 --> 01:50:38,839
- Where are you going?
- To look for a flat.

677
01:50:39,007 --> 01:50:41,008
What kind of flat?

678
01:50:41,176 --> 01:50:43,135
A flat we can live in.

679
01:50:43,303 --> 01:50:45,304
We can live here.

680
01:50:45,472 --> 01:50:48,474
It's squalid. It smells.
It makes me sick.

681
01:50:48,642 --> 01:50:50,601
- Are you coming with me?
- No, no.

682
01:50:50,769 --> 01:50:55,230
I've got to close the windows
and return the key. There's a lot to do.

683
01:51:00,153 --> 01:51:02,237
OK.

684
01:51:02,489 --> 01:51:04,573
- Bye.
- Bye.

685
01:56:26,312 --> 01:56:28,397
The jury has chosen...

686
01:56:28,564 --> 01:56:31,066
...the following ten best couples:

687
01:56:31,234 --> 01:56:32,901
Number three!

688
01:56:33,069 --> 01:56:34,528
Seven!

689
01:56:34,696 --> 01:56:37,239
Eight... Nine...

690
01:56:37,407 --> 01:56:40,117
...11...12...

691
01:56:40,284 --> 01:56:42,327
...13...14...

692
01:56:42,495 --> 01:56:44,579
...15... and 19!

693
01:56:46,082 --> 01:56:50,877
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
good luck for the last tango!

694
01:59:36,419 --> 01:59:38,920
That's the limit!
What are you doing?

695
01:59:39,088 --> 01:59:41,047
You'll have to leave, sir.

696
01:59:41,215 --> 01:59:44,134
Madame! 'Tis ever love.

697
01:59:44,302 --> 01:59:46,553
Go to the circus
if you want to see love!

698
01:59:46,721 --> 01:59:48,680
Go on! Get out of here!

699
01:59:48,848 --> 01:59:50,932
You'll have to leave.

700
02:03:12,009 --> 02:03:13,593
It's over.

701
02:03:14,804 --> 02:03:16,971
Stop it! We're finished.

702
02:03:19,183 --> 02:03:22,477
Go away! Go away! Go away!

703
02:03:22,645 --> 02:03:24,729
Go away!

704
02:03:36,117 --> 02:03:38,368
I'll call the police!

705
02:03:45,668 --> 02:03:47,710
After you, mademoiselle!

706
02:04:18,784 --> 02:04:20,535
It's over!

707
02:04:20,703 --> 02:04:22,704
It's over!

708
