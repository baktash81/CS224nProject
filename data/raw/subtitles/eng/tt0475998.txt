1
00:01:28,101 --> 00:01:31,559
Stand firm, men, for
the King and Monteria!

2
00:01:33,907 --> 00:01:35,499
Back to the sea, dog!

3
00:01:45,218 --> 00:01:46,845
Prince Alexander!

4
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:57,756
Drop your weapons or say
goodbye to your prince!

5
00:02:00,133 --> 00:02:03,625
Robert. I should have known you
were behind this cowardly attack.

6
00:02:03,703 --> 00:02:07,867
Hello, nephew. Sorry I've
missed the family reunions,

7
00:02:08,275 --> 00:02:12,177
but it's been difficult,
being banished and all.

8
00:02:12,512 --> 00:02:14,776
Your punishment
was well-earned.

9
00:02:14,848 --> 00:02:17,373
That depends
on your point of view.

10
00:02:17,684 --> 00:02:21,916
But since your daddy has left
you alone and unprotected,

11
00:02:22,355 --> 00:02:26,621
I thought we could get
reacquainted.

12
00:02:26,893 --> 00:02:28,690
His absence
is but temporary.

13
00:02:28,795 --> 00:02:30,990
He has business
across the Western Sea.

14
00:02:31,064 --> 00:02:33,055
Is that what he told you?

15
00:02:34,501 --> 00:02:37,937
He knew I was growing strong
in the mechanical arts.

16
00:02:38,171 --> 00:02:40,605
Too strong, perhaps,
for even him.

17
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:45,637
You fight bravely
for the son of a coward.

18
00:02:53,787 --> 00:02:55,721
Tie him up!
Your cutlass!

19
00:02:55,789 --> 00:02:57,950
Plenty more at home.
Leave it.

20
00:02:58,024 --> 00:03:00,720
A calling card
for my cowardly brother.

21
00:03:01,561 --> 00:03:05,657
Take him aboard the <i>Stubb!</i>
And be sure to bring the princess as well!

22
00:03:05,732 --> 00:03:08,724
She's not here.
She stayed behind in Monteria.

23
00:03:10,437 --> 00:03:13,304
Search the ship.
Find the girl.

24
00:03:13,373 --> 00:03:15,500
I tell you,
she's not here!

25
00:03:33,593 --> 00:03:35,026
Aha!

26
00:03:51,878 --> 00:03:53,903
Are you certain
he's gone?

27
00:03:54,581 --> 00:03:58,278
I say, my lady, it may be
prudent to remain under wraps.

28
00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:00,447
My lady?

29
00:04:01,755 --> 00:04:03,450
My brother needs help.

30
00:04:03,523 --> 00:04:06,788
Oh, heavens, my lady!
As your butler, I cannot allow you to...

31
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,293
Step aside, Willory.

32
00:04:08,361 --> 00:04:10,488
But, my lady,
it's a boatful of pirates

33
00:04:10,564 --> 00:04:12,930
and your fencing classes
have just begun!

34
00:04:12,999 --> 00:04:15,229
You're not yet
up to the task!

35
00:04:16,202 --> 00:04:17,635
Perhaps you're right.

36
00:04:17,704 --> 00:04:19,763
Then there's only
one thing to do.

37
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,899
Indeed. Stay hidden until
the rogues have left.

38
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:25,438
My lady?

39
00:04:26,913 --> 00:04:28,278
What is it?

40
00:04:28,381 --> 00:04:31,179
It's from my father.
His own creation.

41
00:04:31,818 --> 00:04:35,879
He said I was to use it only
in the gravest of circumstances.

42
00:04:37,157 --> 00:04:39,489
I'd say this qualifies.

43
00:04:39,559 --> 00:04:41,186
But what does it do?

44
00:04:41,261 --> 00:04:42,922
It's a Helpseeker.

45
00:04:47,767 --> 00:04:50,395
We need help.
Alexander has been taken.

46
00:04:50,704 --> 00:04:53,639
The situation is dire.
Please bring back...

47
00:04:54,374 --> 00:04:56,774
Let me see.
What do we need?

48
00:04:57,277 --> 00:04:59,006
The army! The navy!

49
00:04:59,179 --> 00:05:02,740
Heroes. We need heroes
that can save Alexander!

50
00:05:19,733 --> 00:05:21,598
She's not on board, sir.

51
00:05:21,668 --> 00:05:25,832
Blast! Send spies to Monteria
and the surrounding isles.

52
00:05:25,905 --> 00:05:27,702
I need them both.

53
00:05:42,355 --> 00:05:43,583
Heroes?

54
00:05:44,624 --> 00:05:47,149
Yes. Heroes.

55
00:06:21,961 --> 00:06:23,656
<i>Oh</i>

56
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:25,698
<i>It's Spanish gold</i>
<i>for all tonight</i>

57
00:06:25,765 --> 00:06:27,756
<i>For King and country,</i>
<i>now we fight</i>

58
00:06:27,834 --> 00:06:30,735
<i>Our shirts are loose</i>
<i>Our pants are tight</i>

59
00:06:30,804 --> 00:06:32,704
<i>It's Spanish gold</i>
<i>for all tonight</i>

60
00:06:32,772 --> 00:06:34,831
<i>It's Spanish gold</i>
<i>for all tonight</i>

61
00:06:34,908 --> 00:06:36,341
Have you seen
the show before?

62
00:06:36,409 --> 00:06:37,740
No, too expensive.

63
00:06:37,811 --> 00:06:40,541
My boyfriend got me in for
free tonight. He works here.

64
00:06:40,613 --> 00:06:43,104
Oh, mine, too.
Family Night, right?

65
00:06:43,183 --> 00:06:44,946
Right.
Is he in the show?

66
00:06:45,018 --> 00:06:47,316
No, he's just
a cabin boy.

67
00:06:47,387 --> 00:06:49,753
Same here.
But not for long.

68
00:06:49,823 --> 00:06:53,759
Elliot says he's a shoo-in for
the show, as soon as he tries out.

69
00:06:53,827 --> 00:06:57,024
Wait. You're Elliot's date?
Our boyfriends are friends!

70
00:06:58,198 --> 00:06:59,426
Is that bad?

71
00:06:59,499 --> 00:07:02,400
No. There's something
behind you.

72
00:07:04,637 --> 00:07:06,036
Where is he?

73
00:07:06,573 --> 00:07:09,007
For the flower
of all gourds.

74
00:07:10,543 --> 00:07:13,239
Oh, Sedgewick,
you're too cute.

75
00:07:13,546 --> 00:07:15,036
Anything for you, Ellen.

76
00:07:15,115 --> 00:07:17,015
<i>It's Spanish gold</i>
<i>for all tonight</i>

77
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:19,051
<i>As Spaniards quake</i>
<i>to see the sight</i>

78
00:07:19,119 --> 00:07:22,088
<i>Our flag unfurled</i>
<i>with black and white</i>

79
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:28,993
<i>It's Spanish gold</i>
<i>for all tonight!</i>

80
00:07:29,062 --> 00:07:30,324
Hooray, Sir Frederick!

81
00:07:30,396 --> 00:07:32,125
Picture for
the happy couple?

82
00:07:32,198 --> 00:07:33,222
Sure, why not?

83
00:07:33,299 --> 00:07:36,063
Oh, Sedgewick, come here.
Put your face close to me.

84
00:07:38,705 --> 00:07:40,002
Look at that.
<i>Soy la reina.</i>

85
00:07:40,073 --> 00:07:41,870
I'm the queen,
you're the king.

86
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:46,478
I'll catch up
with you later.

87
00:07:47,514 --> 00:07:49,948
Hey!
Cabin boy! Refill!

88
00:07:50,817 --> 00:07:53,650
I'm telling you this job
will be the death of me.

89
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,551
But you're going to
keep at it

90
00:07:55,622 --> 00:07:58,614
so you don't end up back
in your parents' basement.

91
00:07:58,691 --> 00:07:59,658
Right.

92
00:07:59,726 --> 00:08:00,920
I like your toy.

93
00:08:00,994 --> 00:08:04,191
It's not a toy, it's
a labor-saving device!

94
00:08:04,731 --> 00:08:07,996
Sedgewick, meet Bernadette.
She's Elliot's girlfriend.

95
00:08:08,067 --> 00:08:09,364
Pleased to meet you.

96
00:08:09,435 --> 00:08:11,913
Sweetie, how about
having your little car

97
00:08:11,914 --> 00:08:13,565
fetch me some barbecue sauce?

98
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,629
It's in the back room.

99
00:08:18,144 --> 00:08:19,611
Out of range.

100
00:08:20,046 --> 00:08:23,743
Well, how about you fetch
me some barbecue sauce?

101
00:08:24,117 --> 00:08:27,382
It's in the back room.
Out of range.

102
00:08:27,754 --> 00:08:28,846
Sedgewick!

103
00:08:28,922 --> 00:08:31,823
There he is now. Hi, Elliot.

104
00:08:31,891 --> 00:08:32,915
Hey, Bernadette.

105
00:08:32,992 --> 00:08:34,653
Elliot, would you run
to the back room

106
00:08:34,727 --> 00:08:37,491
and get some barbecue sauce
for my new friend, Ellen?

107
00:08:37,564 --> 00:08:40,863
You know I would, Bernadette,
but, it's just that

108
00:08:41,034 --> 00:08:44,731
the back room
is real, real dark.

109
00:08:46,072 --> 00:08:47,130
And?

110
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,030
It's on my list.

111
00:08:49,108 --> 00:08:50,370
His list?

112
00:08:50,743 --> 00:08:54,611
His list of things he's afraid of.
It's extensive.

113
00:08:54,981 --> 00:08:57,381
Well, I don't need
barbecue sauce that badly.

114
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:58,815
Why doesn't
he get it?

115
00:08:58,885 --> 00:09:00,182
Too much work.

116
00:09:00,253 --> 00:09:01,880
George!
- Huh?

117
00:09:01,955 --> 00:09:06,016
We'll have George get it.
You can talk him into anything.

118
00:09:06,292 --> 00:09:07,316
I'm back!

119
00:09:07,393 --> 00:09:08,951
What took so long?

120
00:09:09,362 --> 00:09:12,820
Oh, I had to run an errand
for another cabin boy.

121
00:09:13,199 --> 00:09:14,427
George.

122
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,867
Oh, it was nothing.
How do the kids like the show?

123
00:09:17,937 --> 00:09:21,373
It's great. Did you see Sir Frederick
knock that guy into the water?

124
00:09:21,441 --> 00:09:23,432
I liked it when he
swung on the rope.

125
00:09:23,509 --> 00:09:25,568
They're both pretty taken
with Sir Frederick.

126
00:09:25,645 --> 00:09:27,272
He's cool!
Yeah!

127
00:09:27,647 --> 00:09:28,671
Right.

128
00:09:28,748 --> 00:09:30,134
Hey, after the show's over,

129
00:09:30,135 --> 00:09:32,548
you want me to take you
down on the pirate ship?

130
00:09:32,619 --> 00:09:34,280
Sir Frederick
is gonna take us.

131
00:09:34,354 --> 00:09:35,378
What?

132
00:09:35,455 --> 00:09:37,446
You don't need to wait
for Sir Frederick.

133
00:09:37,523 --> 00:09:39,718
I could take you
on the set tonight.

134
00:09:39,792 --> 00:09:42,625
Yeah, Dad, but Mom says
if we come back on Friday

135
00:09:42,695 --> 00:09:46,791
I can bring some money and get a
sword just like Sir Frederick's.

136
00:09:46,866 --> 00:09:48,731
I'll wait till Friday.

137
00:09:48,835 --> 00:09:52,271
You're no match for me!

138
00:09:52,338 --> 00:09:55,501
Take that!
Taste my steel!

139
00:09:55,575 --> 00:09:58,169
Cool!
Did you see Sir Frederick?

140
00:09:58,244 --> 00:09:59,643
He's a hero!

141
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,854
Hey, cabin boy!
Refill!

142
00:10:11,524 --> 00:10:12,718
Coming.

143
00:10:24,938 --> 00:10:27,168
I can't believe my own
kids are coming back

144
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,606
to get a tour
from Sir Frederick.

145
00:10:29,809 --> 00:10:31,470
It's just 'cause
he's in the show.

146
00:10:31,544 --> 00:10:35,241
And he's big and strong
and brave and manly.

147
00:10:36,282 --> 00:10:38,750
When I'm in the show,
after my audition,

148
00:10:38,818 --> 00:10:40,843
Bernadette'll think
I'm a hero, too.

149
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,081
Yeah, after
your audition.

150
00:10:43,156 --> 00:10:46,683
Look at George here. This guy
knows every line in that show.

151
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:50,058
He knows more about pirates
than Blackbeard himself.

152
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:52,157
So, why didn't
he try out?

153
00:10:52,231 --> 00:10:54,358
Yeah, George.
Why don't you?

154
00:10:54,434 --> 00:10:57,562
It would never work.
I'm just not the type.

155
00:10:58,237 --> 00:10:59,704
There you go.

156
00:11:09,115 --> 00:11:12,482
Excuse me, sir.
The day's show is over.

157
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,554
I say, the show is over.

158
00:11:16,622 --> 00:11:20,558
The hour is near.
The call is coming.

159
00:11:20,626 --> 00:11:22,719
Adventure awaits.

160
00:11:23,496 --> 00:11:28,126
Though you will stumble, the
crab will show you the light.

161
00:11:28,868 --> 00:11:33,532
When adversity devours you,
a lever will set you free.

162
00:11:34,574 --> 00:11:40,706
When all hope is gone, help will
come from above in the shape of

163
00:11:41,914 --> 00:11:43,711
a donkey!

164
00:11:44,817 --> 00:11:47,183
Take heed, O friends.

165
00:11:47,253 --> 00:11:52,190
The stage is set
for the heroes at hand.

166
00:12:04,704 --> 00:12:08,071
The crab of adversity
will devour the donkey?

167
00:12:08,141 --> 00:12:09,904
What was that about?

168
00:12:10,309 --> 00:12:14,177
And why would a blind guy come
to a dinner theater, anyway?

169
00:12:14,614 --> 00:12:16,605
Maybe he likes the music.

170
00:12:17,617 --> 00:12:19,482
I know what it means.
- What?

171
00:12:19,552 --> 00:12:23,079
Don't you see? "The stage is
set for the heroes at hand."

172
00:12:23,156 --> 00:12:24,987
We're gonna be
in the show, all of us.

173
00:12:25,058 --> 00:12:26,082
What?

174
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:28,320
Listen to me.
There's the stage.

175
00:12:28,394 --> 00:12:31,022
We're the heroes
at hand. Get it?

176
00:12:31,097 --> 00:12:34,191
If we all audition,
we're going to be stars.

177
00:12:34,267 --> 00:12:35,962
How would he know?

178
00:12:36,536 --> 00:12:39,300
The blind are often
blessed with keen insight.

179
00:12:39,372 --> 00:12:42,170
Our gals would really look up
to us if we were in the show.

180
00:12:42,241 --> 00:12:44,732
And my kids would think
I'm a hero.

181
00:12:45,311 --> 00:12:48,906
The stage is set
for the heroes at hand.

182
00:12:48,981 --> 00:12:51,973
I got my own set of pirate
costumes in my locker.

183
00:12:52,051 --> 00:12:55,612
I've been saving them for,
you know, whatever.

184
00:12:55,688 --> 00:12:57,519
"The hour is near."

185
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:59,217
"The call is coming."

186
00:12:59,292 --> 00:13:01,590
Let's give it a shot!

187
00:13:03,029 --> 00:13:05,122
Okay, let's get this
over with.

188
00:13:05,198 --> 00:13:07,598
It's way past my bedtime.

189
00:13:07,667 --> 00:13:09,760
Ready when you are,
Mr. Hibbing!

190
00:13:09,836 --> 00:13:10,825
All right.

191
00:13:10,903 --> 00:13:13,337
<i>Andy, cue the music</i>
<i>and the lights.</i>

192
00:13:13,439 --> 00:13:16,636
<i>Scene Three positions.</i>
<i>Let's see what you've got.</i>

193
00:13:17,877 --> 00:13:19,640
Here we go.

194
00:13:20,847 --> 00:13:22,872
Avast, you scurvy dogs.

195
00:13:22,949 --> 00:13:26,976
You came from the sea and
to the sea you shall return.

196
00:13:27,053 --> 00:13:29,180
<i>Pirate two, position five.</i>

197
00:13:30,857 --> 00:13:32,085
Okay.

198
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,860
I go aloft, Captain.

199
00:13:35,928 --> 00:13:38,954
The height will afford me
a keener view.

200
00:13:43,302 --> 00:13:45,668
<i>Pirate three,</i>
<i>position four.</i>

201
00:13:45,738 --> 00:13:49,196
Your cutlass be sharper
than your mind, bilge rat.

202
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:54,207
Can I do my lines from here?
I'm pooped.

203
00:13:54,747 --> 00:13:56,078
<i>Trigger B.</i>

204
00:13:58,851 --> 00:14:00,944
Whoa!
That's on my list.

205
00:14:19,872 --> 00:14:20,998
Ahoy.

206
00:14:24,777 --> 00:14:28,338
I can't believe he fired us
just for failing an audition.

207
00:14:28,414 --> 00:14:30,541
And breaking
the restaurant.

208
00:14:31,117 --> 00:14:32,778
Man, that's it for me.

209
00:14:32,852 --> 00:14:36,219
It's back to my parents'
basement and goodbye Ellen.

210
00:14:36,956 --> 00:14:38,617
I needed that job.

211
00:14:39,592 --> 00:14:41,184
Sure, we can get
some ice cream.

212
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,989
Okay, double-fudge for me.

213
00:14:43,062 --> 00:14:46,031
Hi, Jacob.
Hello, Mr. Lewis.

214
00:14:46,599 --> 00:14:48,294
Heard about
your audition.

215
00:14:48,367 --> 00:14:52,167
I guess that makes you
"The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything."

216
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:59,634
Well, tough luck.
Some guys got it and some guys don't.

217
00:15:00,413 --> 00:15:03,898
No wonder George Jr.
wants to hang out with us.

218
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:04,975
His dad's a loser.

219
00:15:09,922 --> 00:15:12,789
I don't know what went wrong.
The old man...

220
00:15:12,892 --> 00:15:15,520
What went wrong is
that we listened to you!

221
00:15:15,595 --> 00:15:18,063
I should be at home
right now, watching TV

222
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:20,690
as a happily employed
cabin boy.

223
00:15:21,601 --> 00:15:25,401
I guess guys like us will
never be more than cabin boys.

224
00:15:26,372 --> 00:15:27,930
Oh, come on, guys.

225
00:15:28,007 --> 00:15:31,841
Things look kind of bad right now,
but something will turn up.

226
00:15:42,722 --> 00:15:44,349
See what I mean?

227
00:15:45,057 --> 00:15:46,046
Free garbage.

228
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:50,289
Oh, now we're headed someplace.
We've got a metal ball.

229
00:15:52,832 --> 00:15:54,925
Well, what is it?

230
00:15:55,201 --> 00:15:58,602
Well, it could be something
valuable, like a Russian satellite.

231
00:15:58,671 --> 00:16:00,161
Or maybe a bomb.

232
00:16:00,239 --> 00:16:02,332
I don't think
it's a bomb.

233
00:16:03,342 --> 00:16:04,639
Uh-oh.

234
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:05,688
I told you it was a bomb.

235
00:16:05,689 --> 00:16:07,645
Chuck it in the river.
It think it might be a bomb.

236
00:16:07,713 --> 00:16:09,476
I don't think it's a bomb.
I think it's a bomb.

237
00:16:09,548 --> 00:16:11,836
It's a bomb!
It's a bomb for sure!

238
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:13,143
I saw this on TV once.

239
00:16:13,219 --> 00:16:14,709
It's a bomb!

240
00:16:14,787 --> 00:16:16,812
I don't think
it's a bomb.

241
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:21,217
What happened?

242
00:16:21,294 --> 00:16:22,761
It stopped blinking.

243
00:16:22,828 --> 00:16:25,058
I pushed the button.

244
00:16:25,131 --> 00:16:26,689
You did what?

245
00:16:40,513 --> 00:16:42,947
There's something
you don't see every day.

246
00:16:43,015 --> 00:16:46,746
So, we lost our jobs,
but we got a rowboat.

247
00:16:47,253 --> 00:16:48,914
So maybe it's a wash.

248
00:16:48,988 --> 00:16:51,786
Oh, okay.
I'll say, "Hey, Ellen.

249
00:16:51,857 --> 00:16:53,518
"The bad news is,
I got fired

250
00:16:53,592 --> 00:16:55,787
"and I'm living in
my parents' basement again.

251
00:16:55,861 --> 00:16:58,523
"The good news is,
I got a rowboat."

252
00:16:59,665 --> 00:17:01,360
It's so old.

253
00:17:01,434 --> 00:17:03,269
Well, you know the saying.

254
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:06,303
"Give a man a fish and
he'll eat for a day.

255
00:17:06,372 --> 00:17:08,806
"Give a man a rowboat
and he'll..."

256
00:17:10,576 --> 00:17:12,544
You ruined my life!

257
00:17:17,049 --> 00:17:19,574
Hey, we could
have two rowboats.

258
00:17:19,652 --> 00:17:20,676
Wait!

259
00:17:45,911 --> 00:17:50,143
I'm thinking we should avoid
pushing any more buttons!

260
00:17:50,216 --> 00:17:51,979
I was going to
get us another rowboat.

261
00:17:52,051 --> 00:17:53,362
Well, you didn't!

262
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:56,988
You didn't get us another rowboat!
You got us...

263
00:17:58,190 --> 00:17:59,657
You got us...

264
00:18:00,626 --> 00:18:02,093
Where are we?

265
00:18:02,628 --> 00:18:05,188
We appear
to be at sea.

266
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:09,361
It's a lovely day.

267
00:18:13,372 --> 00:18:15,704
Take me home!
Put me back!

268
00:18:15,775 --> 00:18:17,140
I don't know how.

269
00:18:17,209 --> 00:18:20,474
Push another button!
You're the king of the buttons!

270
00:18:20,546 --> 00:18:24,983
But it doesn't do anything if they
aren't blinking. They're not blinking.

271
00:18:26,986 --> 00:18:28,510
See? Nothing.

272
00:18:28,587 --> 00:18:30,782
Hey, I think
I see something.

273
00:18:31,891 --> 00:18:34,826
It's a ship.
Let's row over and check it out.

274
00:18:36,061 --> 00:18:37,028
Row?

275
00:18:37,096 --> 00:18:38,448
Yeah. It's a rowboat.

276
00:18:38,449 --> 00:18:41,089
Each of you grab an
oar and start rowing.

277
00:18:42,535 --> 00:18:44,323
Hey, scoot over a little bit.

278
00:18:44,324 --> 00:18:46,665
We got to even out
the weight a little.

279
00:18:46,739 --> 00:18:47,763
You hold the skinny part.

280
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,104
I wanna be the rudder.
Can I be the rudder?

281
00:18:50,176 --> 00:18:51,336
You're not
rowing together.

282
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:52,536
No, you're going the wrong way.

283
00:18:52,611 --> 00:18:55,944
It's not a metaphor.
I'm talking literally.

284
00:18:58,584 --> 00:19:01,075
It's a girl.
Ahoy, there!

285
00:19:02,788 --> 00:19:04,756
Ahoy, strange seafarers.

286
00:19:05,157 --> 00:19:08,422
What brings you so far from
shore in such a modest vessel?

287
00:19:08,494 --> 00:19:10,291
Well, it's kind of funny.

288
00:19:10,362 --> 00:19:13,195
We found this rowboat
in the alley

289
00:19:13,265 --> 00:19:16,564
because there was a ball
in the garbage truck.

290
00:19:16,635 --> 00:19:17,693
This ball.

291
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:19,067
The Helpseeker.

292
00:19:19,138 --> 00:19:21,072
Willory, they've come!

293
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:22,732
Who's come, my lady?

294
00:19:22,808 --> 00:19:24,867
The heroes.
They're here!

295
00:19:25,444 --> 00:19:26,411
What'd she say?

296
00:19:26,479 --> 00:19:29,505
We've been waiting for you.
Quickly, come up.

297
00:19:32,318 --> 00:19:34,218
It's splendid
to meet you.

298
00:19:34,286 --> 00:19:37,084
I'm Eloise,
Princess of Monteria,

299
00:19:37,156 --> 00:19:39,420
and this is my butler,
Willory.

300
00:19:40,693 --> 00:19:45,460
We haven't much time. Pirates have
taken my brother, Prince Alexander.

301
00:19:45,531 --> 00:19:47,692
With my father, the King,
away in the west,

302
00:19:47,766 --> 00:19:51,065
it is imperative that we
mount a rescue immediately.

303
00:19:52,671 --> 00:19:54,138
So?

304
00:19:54,206 --> 00:19:56,174
Well, you're the heroes.

305
00:19:56,876 --> 00:19:58,366
Any questions?

306
00:20:01,013 --> 00:20:03,311
My lady,
may I have a word?

307
00:20:03,382 --> 00:20:04,713
We need to talk.

308
00:20:04,783 --> 00:20:06,944
Certainly.
One moment.

309
00:20:07,019 --> 00:20:08,987
We'll be
right with you.

310
00:20:09,455 --> 00:20:13,983
I mean no disrespect, but these
men hardly seem the heroic type.

311
00:20:14,393 --> 00:20:16,623
They're short,
rather pudgy,

312
00:20:16,695 --> 00:20:20,290
and for heaven's sake,
they were rowing around the ocean.

313
00:20:20,366 --> 00:20:22,698
What is going on here?

314
00:20:22,768 --> 00:20:24,326
She thinks we're, uh...

315
00:20:24,403 --> 00:20:25,631
Heroes.

316
00:20:25,704 --> 00:20:27,695
But, Willory,
they have the ball.

317
00:20:27,773 --> 00:20:32,233
Perhaps they plucked it from the
ocean or stole it from the real heroes.

318
00:20:32,311 --> 00:20:34,711
They could be pirates
themselves, you know.

319
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:37,112
I mean,
look how they're dressed.

320
00:20:37,316 --> 00:20:38,408
So, what do we do?

321
00:20:38,484 --> 00:20:41,544
I say we have the asparagus
and the little princess

322
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:44,214
turn this boat around
and take us home.

323
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:46,060
Or we take this opportunity

324
00:20:46,061 --> 00:20:48,420
to do what we've
always wanted to do.

325
00:20:48,494 --> 00:20:49,483
Buy go-carts?

326
00:20:49,562 --> 00:20:51,223
No, be heroes.

327
00:20:51,664 --> 00:20:53,256
But we're cabin boys.

328
00:20:53,332 --> 00:20:55,630
They don't know that.
She called us heroes.

329
00:20:55,701 --> 00:20:56,998
You're kidding, right?

330
00:20:57,069 --> 00:20:59,299
Oh, come on,
how hard could it be?

331
00:20:59,371 --> 00:21:02,829
We sail around, we find the
prince, we go back home heroes.

332
00:21:02,908 --> 00:21:04,466
But how
can we trust them?

333
00:21:04,543 --> 00:21:06,909
Because
I trust my father.

334
00:21:06,979 --> 00:21:10,779
He created the Helpseeker for
one purpose, to bring help.

335
00:21:10,849 --> 00:21:13,374
And this is the help
it has brought.

336
00:21:14,987 --> 00:21:17,353
It's kind of nice
to be called a hero.

337
00:21:17,423 --> 00:21:19,084
Sure beats "loser."

338
00:21:19,158 --> 00:21:21,888
Well, gentlemen, are
you ready for adventure?

339
00:21:21,961 --> 00:21:23,622
Point the way!

340
00:21:23,696 --> 00:21:26,790
Oh, you're not pirates,
are you?

341
00:21:26,865 --> 00:21:28,890
Well, we're...

342
00:21:28,968 --> 00:21:30,663
We sure
aren't cabin boys.

343
00:21:30,736 --> 00:21:33,261
We're friendly pirates,
sort of.

344
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:36,637
Oh. You don't rob
or pillage, do you?

345
00:21:36,709 --> 00:21:39,143
Oh, no, we don't do
any of that stuff.

346
00:21:39,211 --> 00:21:42,044
In fact, we don't do
anything at all.

347
00:21:42,114 --> 00:21:46,551
Back home, they actually call us
"The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything."

348
00:21:46,619 --> 00:21:48,314
That's right.

349
00:21:48,387 --> 00:21:49,854
How comforting.

350
00:21:49,922 --> 00:21:52,482
Well, then, there's
no time to spare.

351
00:21:52,558 --> 00:21:54,219
Great. I'll drive.

352
00:21:57,196 --> 00:21:59,323
We'll just give it some gas.

353
00:22:00,866 --> 00:22:02,163
How do you start this thing?

354
00:22:02,234 --> 00:22:06,261
What a kidder.
Elliot, let me take the wheel.

355
00:22:06,338 --> 00:22:09,739
You scramble up to the
yard and unfurl the topsail.

356
00:22:10,476 --> 00:22:11,534
Come again?

357
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:12,770
Position three.

358
00:22:12,845 --> 00:22:14,813
Oh! Aye, aye, Captain.

359
00:22:20,619 --> 00:22:22,712
So, you guys got TiVo?

360
00:22:23,956 --> 00:22:26,390
Certainly.
Where are my manners?

361
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:28,824
Willory, kindly bring
our friend some tea.

362
00:22:28,894 --> 00:22:30,521
No, TiVo.

363
00:22:30,596 --> 00:22:34,794
It's the recording thing with
the TV thing in the future.

364
00:22:37,202 --> 00:22:38,965
Tea would be lovely.

365
00:22:51,183 --> 00:22:53,310
The spies
are in place, sir.

366
00:23:09,768 --> 00:23:11,258
This is great.

367
00:23:12,871 --> 00:23:15,237
So, where we headed?

368
00:23:15,307 --> 00:23:19,903
We're coming up on a bunch
of islands. Real pointy ones.

369
00:23:19,978 --> 00:23:22,674
Yes, the Whipcrack Islands.

370
00:23:22,748 --> 00:23:26,878
These treacherous waters
shelter many a desperate pirate.

371
00:23:26,952 --> 00:23:30,945
A skilled captain able to sail
this maze will find, at its center,

372
00:23:31,023 --> 00:23:34,686
the Inn of Jolly Joe,
a popular pirate haunt.

373
00:23:35,494 --> 00:23:37,325
Perhaps we should
turn back.

374
00:23:37,396 --> 00:23:40,729
We cannot turn back.
Alexander is counting on us.

375
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,732
Captain, are you
up to the task?

376
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:52,541
Sure. Why, exactly,
do we need to go there?

377
00:23:53,212 --> 00:23:55,339
To find out
more about this.

378
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:59,775
Hey, I've seen that on TV.

379
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:03,384
You can cut a can with it
and still slice a tomato.

380
00:24:04,356 --> 00:24:07,587
This cutlass belongs to the
pirate who took my brother.

381
00:24:07,659 --> 00:24:09,286
If we find out
who the owner is,

382
00:24:09,361 --> 00:24:11,522
we'll be closer
to finding Alexander.

383
00:24:11,597 --> 00:24:14,157
My lady,
I don't think we're safe.

384
00:24:14,233 --> 00:24:16,531
These waters
teem with pirates,

385
00:24:16,602 --> 00:24:19,162
and you'd make
a handsome prize.

386
00:24:19,238 --> 00:24:23,004
We must do whatever it takes
to rescue my brother, Willory.

387
00:24:23,075 --> 00:24:26,010
Besides, we have our
heroes to watch over us.

388
00:24:26,445 --> 00:24:29,175
Does anyone know
where the bathroom is?

389
00:24:30,015 --> 00:24:31,039
Oh.

390
00:24:31,116 --> 00:24:34,779
Don't worry about a thing, Willory.
It's under control.

391
00:24:34,853 --> 00:24:39,051
Listen here, I don't know who
you are or where you came from,

392
00:24:39,124 --> 00:24:44,653
but I know what a hero is and you
three buffoons are most definitely not.

393
00:24:49,568 --> 00:24:51,433
How do we look,
First Mate Elliot?

394
00:24:51,503 --> 00:24:54,666
Looking good, Captain.
Steady as she goes.

395
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:06,178
Huh?

396
00:25:09,421 --> 00:25:13,221
Captain, did you see
anything over there?

397
00:25:16,061 --> 00:25:17,858
Hey, I don't see anything.

398
00:25:18,964 --> 00:25:19,953
Hmm.

399
00:25:23,368 --> 00:25:24,562
Oh, no!

400
00:25:25,204 --> 00:25:27,035
What? Oh, dear!

401
00:25:27,105 --> 00:25:31,041
Drop your sails and
prepare to be boarded!

402
00:25:31,109 --> 00:25:33,236
Quickly, my lady,
you must hide.

403
00:25:33,312 --> 00:25:34,643
What do I do?

404
00:25:37,149 --> 00:25:38,639
We should drop our sails.

405
00:25:38,717 --> 00:25:39,775
What?

406
00:25:39,852 --> 00:25:40,860
Drop the sails!

407
00:25:40,861 --> 00:25:44,221
Get to the yard and undo the knots.
Position three!

408
00:25:44,857 --> 00:25:46,154
Okay.

409
00:25:46,225 --> 00:25:49,490
Perhaps you don't know
who you're dealing with.

410
00:25:49,561 --> 00:25:54,760
This be One-Eyed Louie,
terror of the Seven Seas.

411
00:25:54,833 --> 00:25:58,826
I'm giving you to the count
of five to drop your sails

412
00:25:58,904 --> 00:26:01,566
or we'll send you
to the bottom.

413
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,074
I'm putting you on my list.

414
00:26:04,142 --> 00:26:06,042
Drop the sails!
Drop the sails!

415
00:26:06,111 --> 00:26:07,476
I don't know
how to untie them.

416
00:26:07,546 --> 00:26:08,570
Five...

417
00:26:08,647 --> 00:26:10,740
They're bowline knots.
Break the back!

418
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:12,579
Back of what?
Which? Where?

419
00:26:12,651 --> 00:26:13,675
Four...

420
00:26:13,752 --> 00:26:16,812
The rabbit goes around the
tree twice, then down the hole.

421
00:26:16,889 --> 00:26:18,823
Get the rabbit
out of the hole!

422
00:26:18,891 --> 00:26:20,358
What rabbit?

423
00:26:20,425 --> 00:26:21,824
Three...

424
00:26:21,894 --> 00:26:24,226
<i>Looking for the bathroom</i>

425
00:26:24,296 --> 00:26:28,062
Oh! How quaint.
The princess has a Powder Room!

426
00:26:29,434 --> 00:26:31,732
Locked. All right,
where's the key?

427
00:26:31,803 --> 00:26:33,771
Two...
I'm not getting it.

428
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:36,171
The rabbit,
the middle, the hole!

429
00:26:36,775 --> 00:26:39,539
Here, key, key, key!

430
00:26:39,611 --> 00:26:41,069
Oh! Look, there you are.

431
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:43,741
On a big ring,
just like at the gas station.

432
00:26:43,815 --> 00:26:45,248
One.

433
00:26:45,317 --> 00:26:48,946
Come on.
I got to go!

434
00:27:12,678 --> 00:27:16,739
What a marvelous strategy,
pretending you couldn't untie a knot

435
00:27:16,815 --> 00:27:19,010
while Sedgewick crept
down to the gun deck.

436
00:27:19,084 --> 00:27:21,143
What cunning!
What bravery!

437
00:27:21,219 --> 00:27:24,848
Oh, it was nothing. Really.

438
00:27:24,923 --> 00:27:27,084
I told you
they were heroes.

439
00:27:37,469 --> 00:27:40,905
I don't have to
go to the bathroom no more!

440
00:27:45,811 --> 00:27:48,905
Get a move on.
Hurry it up!

441
00:27:51,049 --> 00:27:53,540
Welcome to
my kingdom, Prince.

442
00:27:54,152 --> 00:27:57,383
It's not quite as homely
as your father's,

443
00:27:58,090 --> 00:28:00,388
but it's great
for entertaining.

444
00:28:00,525 --> 00:28:01,822
Whoa!

445
00:28:01,893 --> 00:28:03,724
Have fun!

446
00:28:03,795 --> 00:28:07,196
You can't hide, Robert.
My father will send help.

447
00:28:07,265 --> 00:28:10,166
Oh, I would enjoy that.

448
00:28:10,235 --> 00:28:11,896
All are welcome.

449
00:28:15,107 --> 00:28:16,972
Watch your step.

450
00:28:28,954 --> 00:28:30,888
Any sign
of the inn yet?

451
00:28:31,156 --> 00:28:32,248
Anything?

452
00:28:32,324 --> 00:28:33,848
Not yet.

453
00:28:33,925 --> 00:28:38,055
My father will be very pleased
that his Helpseeker found you all.

454
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:39,961
You love your dad
a lot, huh?

455
00:28:40,032 --> 00:28:42,796
Oh, yes.
He's a wonderful king.

456
00:28:43,235 --> 00:28:48,832
Wise, brave, but he always finds
time for me, his little Eloise.

457
00:28:49,174 --> 00:28:50,766
Oh, that's great.

458
00:28:50,842 --> 00:28:54,073
I'd figure a king would be
kind of busy most of the time.

459
00:28:54,146 --> 00:28:57,513
Oh, but he's much more
than just an ordinary king.

460
00:28:59,217 --> 00:29:00,844
Do you have children?

461
00:29:00,919 --> 00:29:04,855
Sure do. George Jr.
and Lucy. Great kids.

462
00:29:04,923 --> 00:29:08,620
I'm sure they know how lucky
they are. A hero for a father!

463
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:14,423
I see something!

464
00:29:14,499 --> 00:29:16,899
It looks like an inn
or something.

465
00:29:25,243 --> 00:29:27,108
I'm asking again,
my lady,

466
00:29:27,179 --> 00:29:30,273
for your own safety,
please return to the ship.

467
00:29:31,249 --> 00:29:35,583
You are a princess, and this inn
is full of treacherous pirates!

468
00:29:35,654 --> 00:29:37,138
Yes, thank you, Willory.

469
00:29:37,139 --> 00:29:39,488
But my brother's
life may be at stake.

470
00:29:40,158 --> 00:29:42,820
Even princesses
can do what's right.

471
00:29:43,795 --> 00:29:45,558
Yes, of course.

472
00:29:51,269 --> 00:29:53,703
You'll need to befriend
a group of pirates,

473
00:29:53,772 --> 00:29:56,639
then ask them about the
owner of this cutlass.

474
00:29:56,708 --> 00:29:57,800
Right.

475
00:29:57,876 --> 00:30:01,039
And, for heaven's sake,
keep your wits about you.

476
00:30:01,113 --> 00:30:03,638
These are treacherous men.

477
00:30:03,715 --> 00:30:04,875
Join in!

478
00:30:05,646 --> 00:30:08,386
<i>Argh, argh, argh, argh, argh,</i>
<i>argh, argh, argh, argh, argh</i>

<i>argh, argh, argh!</i>

<i>Grab your root beer,</i>

481
00:30:16,895 --> 00:30:18,487
<i>Whack your shipmate</i>

482
00:30:18,563 --> 00:30:20,428
<i>Yank his hair</i>

483
00:30:20,499 --> 00:30:22,091
<i>Watch your back,</i>

484
00:30:22,167 --> 00:30:23,794
<i>Grab your root beer,</i>

485
00:30:23,869 --> 00:30:25,837
<i>Whack your shipmate</i>

486
00:30:25,904 --> 00:30:27,496
<i>Yank his hair</i>

00:30:27,572 --> 00:30:29,267

<i>Argh, argh, argh, argh, argh</i>

490
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,075
You've got it
now! Keep it up, lads!

491
00:30:36,114 --> 00:30:39,413
<i>Swing your shipmate, promenade</i>
<i>Smack him with a rusty blade</i>

492
00:30:39,484 --> 00:30:40,986
<i>Spin around and do-si-do</i>

493
00:30:40,987 --> 00:30:43,215
<i>Watch your step,</i>
<i>it's Jolly Joe's</i>

494
00:30:43,288 --> 00:30:46,621
<i>Swing your shipmate, promenade</i>
<i>Smack him with a rusty blade</i>

495
00:30:46,691 --> 00:30:48,019
<i>Spin around and do-si-do</i>

00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,990
<i>Watch your step,</i>

<i>Argh, argh, argh, argh, argh</i>

499
00:30:52,516 --> 00:30:53,658
Watch your

500
00:30:53,732 --> 00:30:56,929
<i>Argh, argh, argh, argh, argh</i>

501
00:30:57,002 --> 00:31:00,301
<i>Pirates do as pirates please</i>

502
00:31:00,372 --> 00:31:03,432
<i>We're terrors</i>
<i>of the Seven Seas</i>

503
00:31:03,508 --> 00:31:07,308
<i>And when we've pillaged</i>
<i>all our foes</i>

504
00:31:07,379 --> 00:31:14,342
<i>There ain't no place</i>
<i>like Jolly Joe's!</i>

505
00:31:14,619 --> 00:31:18,111
<i>Grab a keg of ginger ale</i>
<i>Hop up on a wooden pail</i>

506
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:19,885
<i>Drop it on</i>
<i>your shipmate's toes!</i>

507
00:31:19,958 --> 00:31:20,947
Oh!

508
00:31:21,026 --> 00:31:25,861
<i>There ain't no place</i>

509
00:31:25,931 --> 00:31:27,660
<i>Argh, argh, argh, argh, argh</i>

Argh, great! Argh!

512
00:31:35,106 --> 00:31:38,473
They sound jolly, but
they don't look so jolly.

513
00:31:40,912 --> 00:31:42,675
Okay, boys,
deal them up.

514
00:31:42,747 --> 00:31:44,840
That deck's got
to be swabbed.

515
00:31:44,916 --> 00:31:49,410
Excuse me, gentlemen.
I was wondering if you could,

516
00:31:49,854 --> 00:31:51,788
if you could tell me...

517
00:31:54,526 --> 00:31:57,927
What's the matter there?
Parrot got your tongue?

518
00:31:59,698 --> 00:32:01,165
Well, I...

519
00:32:01,233 --> 00:32:06,034
He looks like a captain,
but he talks like a cabin boy!

520
00:32:11,576 --> 00:32:14,374
It isn't going to work.
Let's just go.

521
00:32:14,446 --> 00:32:18,075
Let me try. You got to know
how to talk to these guys.

522
00:32:18,883 --> 00:32:22,114
Argh!
'Twas a fine day at sea today.

523
00:32:22,187 --> 00:32:26,556
Took a 12-gun brigantine
and 10,000 pieces of eight.

524
00:32:26,625 --> 00:32:29,822
Argh! Well, we took
an 18-gun sloop

525
00:32:29,894 --> 00:32:32,294
and 20,000 pieces
of eight.

526
00:32:32,364 --> 00:32:34,559
Aye, but did you
show no mercy?

527
00:32:34,633 --> 00:32:35,622
Not a bit!

528
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,463
Were you cruel and unusual?

529
00:32:37,535 --> 00:32:39,025
The cruelest!

530
00:32:39,104 --> 00:32:42,767
Well, me hearties,
that was a fine day!

531
00:32:44,276 --> 00:32:46,437
Grab a chair,
and join the game!

532
00:32:46,511 --> 00:32:47,603
All right!

533
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:50,614
Come on in. Serve them up,
pour them up, pull them up.

534
00:32:50,682 --> 00:32:54,846
Ahem! By the way, mateys,
have any of you seen this?

535
00:33:00,859 --> 00:33:03,327
Is that a yes or a no?

536
00:33:07,232 --> 00:33:09,029
Aye, lad.

537
00:33:10,568 --> 00:33:12,763
The cutlass
belongs to Robert.

538
00:33:12,837 --> 00:33:14,634
Robert the Terrible.

539
00:33:15,907 --> 00:33:17,374
My uncle!

540
00:33:17,442 --> 00:33:20,138
You have his cutlass,
but you're not he.

541
00:33:20,211 --> 00:33:23,180
The others were fooled,
but I know better.

542
00:33:23,248 --> 00:33:25,443
You know where we
could find this fellow?

543
00:33:25,517 --> 00:33:27,542
His fortress is hidden.

544
00:33:27,619 --> 00:33:31,487
But I've heard tell of an island,
past the Rocks of Malabar.

545
00:33:32,123 --> 00:33:34,182
On that island, a cave.

546
00:33:34,259 --> 00:33:38,821
And in that cave, the clues
to finding his secret lair.

547
00:33:39,397 --> 00:33:42,059
Not that I'd go
looking for it.

548
00:33:42,133 --> 00:33:43,259
And why shouldn't they?

549
00:33:43,335 --> 00:33:46,634
They don't call him
"Robert the Terrible" for nothing.

550
00:33:46,705 --> 00:33:51,608
He's the King's own brother,
but he's as bad as the King is good.

551
00:33:51,676 --> 00:33:54,201
Tried to take the throne
by force, he did.

552
00:33:54,279 --> 00:33:58,181
And, for his treachery,
was banished from Monteria.

553
00:33:58,249 --> 00:33:59,773
So he's a little nasty.

554
00:33:59,851 --> 00:34:01,148
A little?

555
00:34:01,219 --> 00:34:04,245
Aren't you
up for a little adventure?

556
00:34:04,322 --> 00:34:07,519
I hear tell, locked
deep in his fortress,

557
00:34:07,592 --> 00:34:09,753
he's harnessed
the mechanical arts,

558
00:34:09,828 --> 00:34:11,796
to make himself
stronger than the King.

559
00:34:11,863 --> 00:34:15,026
With terrible
iron legs and arms.

560
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:16,260
Not that terrible.

561
00:34:16,334 --> 00:34:19,360
His iron claw
can crack a coconut!

562
00:34:19,437 --> 00:34:21,042
Stop trying to scare them.

563
00:34:21,043 --> 00:34:24,067
Story says he's waiting
for the King to step away,

564
00:34:24,142 --> 00:34:27,373
just long enough to grab
his beloved children

565
00:34:27,445 --> 00:34:30,573
and take the throne
for his own.

566
00:34:30,648 --> 00:34:33,412
So, what would
he do with them?

567
00:34:33,485 --> 00:34:37,546
For Robert to claim the throne,
they must be gone!

568
00:34:37,622 --> 00:34:39,419
On vacation?

569
00:34:39,591 --> 00:34:41,218
Princess Eloise?

570
00:34:46,231 --> 00:34:48,096
So, what would he do
with someone

571
00:34:48,166 --> 00:34:50,361
who was helping
the Prince and Princess?

572
00:34:50,435 --> 00:34:55,338
A cucumber slices much
more easily than a coconut.

573
00:35:01,413 --> 00:35:03,210
Oh, for Pete's sake.

574
00:35:03,982 --> 00:35:07,042
Okay, that's enough adventure
for this gourd.

575
00:35:07,118 --> 00:35:10,383
Clearing tables is really
kind of fun when you think about it.

576
00:35:10,455 --> 00:35:12,685
Don't leave
without me!

577
00:35:12,757 --> 00:35:15,885
Which way would be home?

578
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:19,157
George! Sedgewick! Elliot!
Where are you going?

579
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:21,721
We must sail
for the island at once!

580
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:25,167
Unless, of course, our
heroes are giving up.

581
00:35:25,236 --> 00:35:26,794
Oh, no.

582
00:35:26,871 --> 00:35:30,864
It's just that, you know,
heroes can be very busy.

583
00:35:30,942 --> 00:35:33,740
And now that this situation
is under control,

584
00:35:33,812 --> 00:35:37,009
we've been beckoned
to another crisis.

585
00:35:37,582 --> 00:35:38,640
Somewhere else.

586
00:35:38,716 --> 00:35:40,183
You must be mistaken.

587
00:35:40,251 --> 00:35:42,014
The Helpseeker
brought you here,

588
00:35:42,086 --> 00:35:44,577
and only the Helpseeker
can send you back.

589
00:35:44,656 --> 00:35:46,419
According to
my father's notes,

590
00:35:46,491 --> 00:35:50,018
the red button brings help,
and the blue button sends you home.

591
00:35:50,094 --> 00:35:52,961
But I don't believe it will light
until your work here is done.

592
00:35:53,031 --> 00:35:54,555
I want to go home!

593
00:35:54,632 --> 00:35:58,591
Just get me back to 1972.
I'll walk from there.

594
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:01,662
I don't understand.
You're our heroes!

595
00:36:01,739 --> 00:36:05,004
Brave as lions
and cunning as foxes.

596
00:36:05,743 --> 00:36:07,643
Are you the lion?
'Cause I'm not the lion.

597
00:36:07,712 --> 00:36:11,307
No, you're the chicken.
He's the spineless sea sponge.

598
00:36:11,382 --> 00:36:12,406
Who are you?

599
00:36:12,484 --> 00:36:16,420
I don't know. I'm like
a sleepy little panda.

600
00:36:16,488 --> 00:36:18,854
My father brought you here
for a reason,

601
00:36:18,923 --> 00:36:21,187
and your work here
is not done.

602
00:36:32,003 --> 00:36:34,164
All right, here are
the Rocks of Malabar.

603
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:36,764
But look! There's
no island anywhere.

604
00:36:37,976 --> 00:36:41,139
But Jolly Joe said there's
an island past the rocks.

605
00:36:41,212 --> 00:36:43,373
Well, you're
the King's heroes.

606
00:36:43,448 --> 00:36:46,076
I'll leave the
interpretation up to you.

607
00:36:46,718 --> 00:36:47,878
Ta-ta!

608
00:36:48,753 --> 00:36:50,118
I don't know
about you,

609
00:36:50,188 --> 00:36:53,919
but if I bump into that Robert guy,
I'm going to wet myself.

610
00:36:53,992 --> 00:36:58,326
Well, let's at least go look.
It won't be that hard.

611
00:36:58,396 --> 00:37:02,765
We sail to the Rocks, look
around a little, and then go home.

612
00:37:02,834 --> 00:37:07,533
Our work will be done.
No island, nothing more we can do.

613
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:09,764
I don't know.

614
00:37:09,841 --> 00:37:11,570
Well, what if
the map is wrong?

615
00:37:11,643 --> 00:37:14,043
Come on, guys.
We'll be fine.

616
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:18,105
We can look like heroes without
doing anything dangerous.

617
00:37:20,151 --> 00:37:22,312
That does have
a nice ring to it.

618
00:37:22,387 --> 00:37:23,684
Great plan, George.

619
00:37:23,755 --> 00:37:27,452
What he lacks in spine,
he makes up for in brain.

620
00:37:27,525 --> 00:37:30,653
<i>Raise the mast</i>
<i>on the</i> Steadfast!

621
00:37:31,095 --> 00:37:33,529
<i>Swifter than</i>
<i>a bareback seahorse</i>

622
00:37:33,865 --> 00:37:36,095
<i>Sailing an uncharted</i>
<i>sea course</i>

623
00:37:36,167 --> 00:37:38,294
<i>Who could survive</i>
<i>such a dangerous mission</i>

624
00:37:38,369 --> 00:37:41,099
<i>Alongside pirates</i>
<i>with zero ambition?</i>

625
00:37:41,172 --> 00:37:44,039
<i>We got the coconuts poured</i>

626
00:37:44,108 --> 00:37:46,975
<i>We dropped the hooks overboard</i>

627
00:37:47,045 --> 00:37:49,912
<i>And if you get</i>
<i>a little seasick</i>

628
00:37:49,981 --> 00:37:52,245
<i>We play the haddock</i>
<i>for a hat trick</i>

629
00:37:52,884 --> 00:37:54,818
<i>We got the hammocks</i>
<i>on the main deck</i>

630
00:37:54,886 --> 00:37:55,944
<i>Swingin' low</i>

631
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:57,681
<i>We got the butler doing</i>
<i>the henpeck</i>

632
00:37:57,755 --> 00:37:59,086
<i>Screaming so</i>

633
00:37:59,157 --> 00:38:00,784
<i>He say you should have been</i>
<i>swabbin' the poop deck</i>

634
00:38:00,858 --> 00:38:01,916
<i>We don't know</i>

635
00:38:01,993 --> 00:38:03,718
<i>It's what the other</i>
<i>pirates do-do</i>

636
00:38:03,719 --> 00:38:04,689
<i>But we're bringing you</i>

637
00:38:04,762 --> 00:38:06,389
<i>Yo-ho heroes</i>

638
00:38:06,464 --> 00:38:09,438
<i>Standing in the gap,</i>
<i>where'd you put the toys?</i>

639
00:38:09,439 --> 00:38:10,560
<i>Time to take a nap</i>

640
00:38:10,635 --> 00:38:12,193
<i>Yo-ho heroes</i>

641
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:15,171
<i>Flighty as a bird</i>
<i>Easy is the word</i>

642
00:38:15,239 --> 00:38:18,299
<i>Yo, I'm seeing no heroes</i>

643
00:38:22,113 --> 00:38:24,274
<i>We're on a limbo craze</i>

644
00:38:24,349 --> 00:38:27,147
<i>It's a relic</i>
<i>from our limber days</i>

645
00:38:27,218 --> 00:38:30,085
<i>Now we're stuck</i>
<i>inside the limbo zone</i>

646
00:38:30,154 --> 00:38:31,701
<i>That's where the pirates go</i>

647
00:38:31,702 --> 00:38:34,022
<i>with too much time</i>
<i>and a missing spine</i>

648
00:38:34,092 --> 00:38:35,616
<i>Yo-ho heroes</i>

649
00:38:35,693 --> 00:38:37,002
<i>Standing in the gap</i>

650
00:38:37,003 --> 00:38:39,720
<i>Where'd you put the map?</i>
<i>Take another nap</i>

651
00:38:39,797 --> 00:38:41,424
<i>Yo-ho heroes</i>

652
00:38:41,499 --> 00:38:44,366
<i>Strike a better pose</i>
<i>That's the way it goes</i>

653
00:38:44,435 --> 00:38:47,131
<i>Yo, I'm seeing no heroes</i>

654
00:38:57,248 --> 00:38:59,808
<i>We're on the bad mood swing</i>

655
00:39:00,118 --> 00:39:03,019
<i>We haven't done one thing</i>

656
00:39:03,087 --> 00:39:05,715
<i>Not even the minimum</i>
<i>daily requirement</i>

657
00:39:06,024 --> 00:39:08,891
<i>We got the funk</i>
<i>without the Parliament</i>

658
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,860
<i>But if you're feeling</i>
<i>a little seasick</i>

659
00:39:10,928 --> 00:39:11,952
<i>Rise and shine</i>

660
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:13,588
<i>And you want to get off</i>
<i>the guilt trip</i>

661
00:39:13,665 --> 00:39:14,757
<i>Now's the time</i>

662
00:39:14,832 --> 00:39:16,766
<i>Because the captain</i>
<i>of the main ship</i>

663
00:39:16,834 --> 00:39:17,858
<i>Rings the chime</i>

664
00:39:17,935 --> 00:39:19,884
<i>He could be coming</i>
<i>before you know him</i>

665
00:39:19,885 --> 00:39:21,098
<i>What are you gonna show him?</i>

666
00:39:21,172 --> 00:39:22,400
<i>Go, heroes</i>

667
00:39:22,473 --> 00:39:25,338
<i>Standing in the gap</i>
<i>Taking up the slack</i>

668
00:39:25,339 --> 00:39:26,876
<i>Following the King's map</i>

669
00:39:26,944 --> 00:39:28,241
<i>Go, heroes</i>

670
00:39:28,312 --> 00:39:31,329
<i>Steady as a rock</i>
<i>I know it's a shock</i>

671
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:32,749
<i>Yo, let's be a hero</i>

672
00:39:32,817 --> 00:39:34,114
<i>Go, hero</i>

673
00:39:34,185 --> 00:39:36,983
<i>Standing in the gap</i>
<i>Taking up the slack</i>

674
00:39:36,984 --> 00:39:38,485
<i>Following the King's map</i>

675
00:39:38,556 --> 00:39:39,921
<i>Go, hero</i>

676
00:39:39,991 --> 00:39:42,824
<i>Steady at the wheel</i>
<i>Keep an even keel</i>

677
00:39:42,894 --> 00:39:45,795
<i>Yo, there be the King's heroes</i>

678
00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:01,770
The Rocks of Malabar!

679
00:40:01,846 --> 00:40:04,781
Well, that's it.
No island around here.

680
00:40:04,849 --> 00:40:05,838
Time to go home.

681
00:40:05,917 --> 00:40:10,320
Fellows, fellows!
Let us not give up so easily.

682
00:40:10,388 --> 00:40:12,913
The island
may still lie ahead.

683
00:40:26,871 --> 00:40:29,101
What is that?

684
00:40:29,173 --> 00:40:32,336
<i>El Remolino,</i>
the great whirlpool!

685
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:36,437
But no pirate will sail beyond the
Rocks of Malabar for fear of it.

686
00:40:36,514 --> 00:40:40,644
I thought it was pirate
legend, but there it is.

687
00:40:40,718 --> 00:40:42,515
Okay,
time to go home.

688
00:40:42,587 --> 00:40:44,384
No islands out here.

689
00:40:46,491 --> 00:40:49,255
No, we're going to
keep going.

690
00:40:50,294 --> 00:40:52,888
But didn't you hear him?
It's a giant whirlpool!

691
00:40:52,964 --> 00:40:55,228
"Captain George's
Death Cruise,"

692
00:40:55,299 --> 00:40:58,700
brought to you by
George, the Crazy Grape.

693
00:40:58,770 --> 00:41:01,136
I thought
you were on our side.

694
00:41:01,205 --> 00:41:02,672
Thank you, George.

695
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:05,072
Might be
a giant whirlpool.

696
00:41:05,143 --> 00:41:08,374
Might not be.
Let's hold our course!

697
00:41:12,183 --> 00:41:16,483
That whirlpool holds
nothing but our own demise!

698
00:41:16,554 --> 00:41:18,215
Oh, really?

699
00:41:22,693 --> 00:41:23,990
The island!

700
00:41:24,061 --> 00:41:25,756
Huh. How about that?

701
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:27,457
What?
How could...

702
00:41:27,532 --> 00:41:28,931
It's a sea mirage.

703
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,629
Water droplets in the air
reflecting the sky so perfectly

704
00:41:32,703 --> 00:41:34,933
they block the island
from view.

705
00:41:36,274 --> 00:41:37,935
Weather Channel.

706
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:47,906
Right on time.

707
00:41:48,686 --> 00:41:51,814
And look
who they left behind.

708
00:42:05,636 --> 00:42:07,900
Do you think there are
snakes on this island?

709
00:42:07,972 --> 00:42:09,872
'Cause snakes
are on my list.

710
00:42:09,941 --> 00:42:13,001
Oh, I'm sure there are snakes.
Big ones, too.

711
00:42:13,077 --> 00:42:14,977
And spiders
and bears.

712
00:42:15,046 --> 00:42:16,070
Huh?

713
00:42:16,147 --> 00:42:20,049
Of course, the real question
is why are we on this island?

714
00:42:20,117 --> 00:42:21,311
I don't follow you.

715
00:42:21,385 --> 00:42:22,477
We had a plan!

716
00:42:22,553 --> 00:42:25,954
Sail to the Rocks,
don't find the island, go home!

717
00:42:26,023 --> 00:42:27,752
Which part eluded you?

718
00:42:27,825 --> 00:42:29,554
It was a sea mirage!

719
00:42:29,627 --> 00:42:32,460
You knew that,
but we didn't need to know that.

720
00:42:32,530 --> 00:42:33,827
It's an adventure.

721
00:42:33,898 --> 00:42:35,866
I don't want
any more adventure!

722
00:42:35,933 --> 00:42:38,766
I should be home on the couch
right now, eating cheese curls

723
00:42:38,836 --> 00:42:40,201
and watching
<i>The Love Boat!</i>

724
00:42:40,271 --> 00:42:42,899
Instead, I'm stuck here
with Captain Weather Channel

725
00:42:42,974 --> 00:42:46,569
on my way to be sliced and
diced by Edward Scissorhands!

726
00:42:47,945 --> 00:42:50,505
Look, I don't know
what I'm doing here.

727
00:42:50,581 --> 00:42:52,947
I'm just trying
to help Eloise.

728
00:42:53,017 --> 00:42:55,485
Let's just get the clues
for the Princess.

729
00:42:55,553 --> 00:42:58,078
Maybe then we can go home.

730
00:42:58,155 --> 00:43:01,989
Now, if I were a cave,
where would I be?

731
00:43:02,059 --> 00:43:03,720
Right about there.

732
00:43:11,402 --> 00:43:14,769
Dark, creepy caves
are on my list.

733
00:43:14,839 --> 00:43:16,602
Sedgewick,
look for the clues.

734
00:43:16,674 --> 00:43:19,802
Oh, yeah. To bring me
even closer to my death.

735
00:43:24,682 --> 00:43:27,845
So, what's wrong
with our boat?

736
00:43:27,919 --> 00:43:31,355
We can't sneak up on them
in a pirate boat, you ninny.

737
00:43:32,924 --> 00:43:34,949
So, what do
they look like?

738
00:43:35,026 --> 00:43:36,653
What?
The clues.

739
00:43:36,727 --> 00:43:37,751
I don't know.

740
00:43:37,828 --> 00:43:41,696
Maybe a map or a model of
the world carved out of rock.

741
00:43:41,766 --> 00:43:43,393
Or maybe a billboard.

742
00:43:43,467 --> 00:43:45,526
Not likely.
Too obvious.

743
00:43:45,603 --> 00:43:47,662
No, really.
A billboard.

744
00:43:47,738 --> 00:43:48,966
What?

745
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:55,545
"If a sailor
were to look for me,

746
00:43:55,613 --> 00:43:58,377
"the East
is where he'd start.

747
00:43:58,449 --> 00:44:01,680
"He'd reach
the Isle of Walking Rocks

748
00:44:01,752 --> 00:44:04,880
"and the Clapping Pass
would part.

749
00:44:04,956 --> 00:44:08,084
"Then gaze with pride
upon my keep,

750
00:44:08,159 --> 00:44:10,423
"not found on any chart,

751
00:44:10,494 --> 00:44:13,895
"till he would spy
my steely eye

752
00:44:13,965 --> 00:44:16,559
"and fear
would stop his heart."

753
00:44:17,802 --> 00:44:18,826
Ooh.

754
00:44:18,903 --> 00:44:21,770
"Copyright Robert the Terrible.
All rights reserved."

755
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:24,603
Oh, yeah. That sounds
like fun and all,

756
00:44:24,675 --> 00:44:29,339
but I'd kind of like to keep my heart
going, if it's all the same to you.

757
00:44:29,413 --> 00:44:32,314
So, what do we got?
We head East to...

758
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:36,877
The Isle of Walking Rocks
and the Clapping Pass.

759
00:44:36,954 --> 00:44:39,354
And that's where
this Robert guy hangs out.

760
00:44:39,423 --> 00:44:42,153
And then something
about cardiac arrest.

761
00:44:43,294 --> 00:44:48,322
I don't know, call me crazy, but maybe
our senses of fun are a little bit

762
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:50,990
different.

763
00:44:51,068 --> 00:44:52,433
Holy mackerel.

764
00:44:52,503 --> 00:44:54,437
Holy mackerel!

765
00:44:54,505 --> 00:44:55,995
What? What is it?
What? What is it?

766
00:44:56,073 --> 00:44:57,097
Pieces of eight?

767
00:44:57,174 --> 00:44:58,573
Spanish gold?

768
00:44:58,642 --> 00:45:00,200
Even better.

769
00:45:02,613 --> 00:45:04,376
Cheese curls!

770
00:45:04,448 --> 00:45:06,143
What?
Cheese curls.

771
00:45:06,217 --> 00:45:09,050
Thousands of them.
Maybe millions!

772
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:12,021
Well, grab a few and
let's get back to the boat.

773
00:45:12,089 --> 00:45:14,455
I'm not going
back to the boat.

774
00:45:16,794 --> 00:45:19,592
What do you mean you're
not going back to the boat?

775
00:45:19,663 --> 00:45:22,393
The way I see it,
I have two choices.

776
00:45:22,466 --> 00:45:25,094
Go back to the boat and
continue our little adventure

777
00:45:25,169 --> 00:45:27,729
until we all die
in terrible ways,

778
00:45:27,805 --> 00:45:30,831
or stay on this island
and frolic in the sun

779
00:45:30,908 --> 00:45:34,173
with a lifetime supply
of my favorite snack food.

780
00:45:34,245 --> 00:45:36,440
Now, I'm no
Albert Einstein,

781
00:45:36,514 --> 00:45:38,846
but I'm thinking the
choice is pretty clear.

782
00:45:38,916 --> 00:45:42,875
But, the Princess, she
thinks we're heroes.

783
00:45:42,953 --> 00:45:44,887
Well, she's wrong.

784
00:45:44,955 --> 00:45:49,324
Heroes are tall and strong and brave
and handsome, like Sir Frederick.

785
00:45:49,393 --> 00:45:51,657
We aren't any
of those things.

786
00:45:52,329 --> 00:45:54,923
When you're done pretending,
come on back.

787
00:45:54,999 --> 00:45:57,433
I'll save you
a few cheese curls.

788
00:45:59,837 --> 00:46:02,237
Fine.
Have it your way.

789
00:46:02,306 --> 00:46:04,069
I will. Thank you.

790
00:46:04,141 --> 00:46:05,904
You're not welcome.

791
00:46:14,718 --> 00:46:18,279
Where do I start?
How about you, my little friend?

792
00:46:24,095 --> 00:46:25,187
What?

793
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:32,267
Hey, hey, hey, fellas?

794
00:46:34,138 --> 00:46:35,662
Oh, what does he know?

795
00:46:35,739 --> 00:46:40,733
I know we're not real heroes
but we're not doing so bad.

796
00:46:40,811 --> 00:46:43,109
Let's just
get back to the boat.

797
00:46:44,682 --> 00:46:46,309
Where is she going?

798
00:46:46,383 --> 00:46:47,782
She's sailing away.

799
00:46:47,852 --> 00:46:49,786
But the clues!

800
00:46:49,854 --> 00:46:52,254
Maybe she didn't
need them after all.

801
00:46:53,491 --> 00:46:54,651
Are you beeping?

802
00:46:54,725 --> 00:46:56,158
It's my bag.

803
00:46:56,660 --> 00:46:59,823
The ball. It's the blue button!
We can go home now.

804
00:46:59,897 --> 00:47:02,229
What? That doesn't
make any sense.

805
00:47:02,299 --> 00:47:04,631
It means
our work is done.

806
00:47:04,702 --> 00:47:06,602
Where's the rowboat?

807
00:47:06,670 --> 00:47:10,265
But the ball! It's blinking!
We can go home.

808
00:47:10,341 --> 00:47:13,640
Hold on a sec.
How long has that been here?

809
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:19,377
It's one of Robert's boats.
But where are the men?

810
00:47:20,417 --> 00:47:23,853
The ball!
It's blinking!

811
00:47:27,391 --> 00:47:29,655
Something ain't right.

812
00:47:31,929 --> 00:47:34,557
They've got the Princess!
We got to help her!

813
00:47:34,632 --> 00:47:35,894
Come on!

814
00:47:42,973 --> 00:47:44,531
Listen,
when the ball blinks,

815
00:47:44,608 --> 00:47:46,667
our work is done
and we can go home.

816
00:47:46,744 --> 00:47:50,305
Don't you want to go home?
Don't you want to see your kids?

817
00:47:50,381 --> 00:47:52,406
Sure I want to
see my kids.

818
00:47:53,017 --> 00:47:56,180
But I also want them
to want to see me.

819
00:47:56,253 --> 00:47:59,188
You know, maybe the reason
they don't look up to me

820
00:47:59,256 --> 00:48:03,215
is because I haven't given them
something worth looking up to.

821
00:48:03,294 --> 00:48:04,727
But the ball.

822
00:48:04,795 --> 00:48:08,390
Hey, that ball thought
we were heroes.

823
00:48:08,465 --> 00:48:12,231
It was wrong about that.
It could be wrong about this, too.

824
00:48:12,870 --> 00:48:14,337
Look, Elliot.

825
00:48:15,072 --> 00:48:18,041
If you want to go home,
you can go home.

826
00:48:18,676 --> 00:48:22,168
But Eloise needs me.
And I need to do what's right.

827
00:48:37,861 --> 00:48:39,453
Let's go save a princess!

828
00:48:39,530 --> 00:48:41,259
Help is on the way!

829
00:48:41,966 --> 00:48:44,025
Help!

830
00:48:48,973 --> 00:48:51,999
What kind of a crazy
B movie am I in?

831
00:48:52,076 --> 00:48:55,136
<i>Attack Of</i>
<i>The Killer Cheesecurls?</i>

832
00:48:55,212 --> 00:48:57,703
Okay, guys.
Let's be reasonable.

833
00:48:58,682 --> 00:49:00,547
I wasn't really
going to eat you,

834
00:49:00,618 --> 00:49:03,416
but you were impersonating
a snack food!

835
00:49:09,093 --> 00:49:10,390
Okay, we're off!

836
00:49:10,461 --> 00:49:12,895
I don't think we can
catch up with them.

837
00:49:12,963 --> 00:49:16,660
I think you're right. Then we'll
just have to follow the clues.

838
00:49:16,734 --> 00:49:17,758
The clues?

839
00:49:17,835 --> 00:49:19,234
Yeah, from the billboard.

840
00:49:19,303 --> 00:49:22,272
Head East to the Island
of Walking Rocks.

841
00:49:22,339 --> 00:49:23,966
You think
that's a good idea?

842
00:49:24,041 --> 00:49:26,134
No, but I haven't got
a better one.

843
00:49:26,210 --> 00:49:27,905
East it is!

844
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:31,807
The other east.

845
00:49:31,882 --> 00:49:33,713
East it is!

846
00:49:39,723 --> 00:49:41,623
My sacroiliac.

847
00:49:42,293 --> 00:49:44,887
At least I lost
those cheese curls.

848
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:50,384
They're like roaches!

849
00:49:50,385 --> 00:49:53,327
Sick, demented,
cheese-flavored roaches!

850
00:49:54,004 --> 00:49:55,767
They stuck me here
on purpose.

851
00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:59,969
I bet George knew about those little
things from the Weather Channel, too.

852
00:50:00,044 --> 00:50:02,103
He's trying to kill me.

853
00:50:11,322 --> 00:50:14,155
I can't climb that.
It's too far.

854
00:50:15,192 --> 00:50:16,853
It isn't worth it.

855
00:50:18,996 --> 00:50:21,692
Eaten by his own
favorite snack food.

856
00:50:22,666 --> 00:50:26,466
Could be worse. I could be
eaten by something I don't like.

857
00:50:28,138 --> 00:50:29,469
I give up.

858
00:50:29,907 --> 00:50:31,636
It was a good life.

859
00:50:31,709 --> 00:50:35,304
At least that one day,
from about 2:00 to 2:30.

860
00:50:37,281 --> 00:50:38,748
Hey!

861
00:50:38,816 --> 00:50:41,580
Where did...
That's mine!

862
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:44,580
Ellen.

863
00:50:45,389 --> 00:50:47,823
I bet she'd want me
to come back.

864
00:50:51,995 --> 00:50:53,087
What?

865
00:50:54,331 --> 00:50:55,662
The light.

866
00:50:56,900 --> 00:51:00,097
The crab
will show me the light.

867
00:51:01,472 --> 00:51:05,374
Maybe I can't do it,
but maybe I can!

868
00:51:09,713 --> 00:51:12,511
And this is the day
to find out!

869
00:51:55,826 --> 00:51:59,318
Sorry, boys!
Gourd is off the menu!

870
00:52:11,775 --> 00:52:13,572
What do you want, Robert?

871
00:52:13,644 --> 00:52:17,603
Isn't it obvious?
I want the throne, the crown!

872
00:52:18,348 --> 00:52:21,215
For years I watched
my "noble" brother

873
00:52:21,285 --> 00:52:27,121
use his power for the benefit of every
family in Monteria except our own!

874
00:52:27,191 --> 00:52:29,853
Feed the poor,
help the sick.

875
00:52:29,927 --> 00:52:32,157
The widows,
the orphans,

876
00:52:32,229 --> 00:52:33,856
blah, blah, blah.

877
00:52:33,931 --> 00:52:36,365
My father is a good
and generous King.

878
00:52:36,433 --> 00:52:37,866
Indeed.

879
00:52:37,935 --> 00:52:42,338
He took Monteria's wealth,
our wealth, my wealth,

880
00:52:42,406 --> 00:52:45,375
and squandered it
on strangers. Peasants!

881
00:52:46,276 --> 00:52:52,010
When the crown is mine, I can once
again enjoy the benefits of royalty.

882
00:52:52,483 --> 00:52:56,476
You're not strong enough to take
the crown from my father's head.

883
00:52:56,553 --> 00:52:57,447
Perhaps not.

884
00:52:57,448 --> 00:53:00,649
But with you and your
sister out of the way,

885
00:53:00,724 --> 00:53:03,215
I'll be next in line
for the throne.

886
00:53:03,894 --> 00:53:08,627
And if your father should have
an unfortunate accident...

887
00:53:08,966 --> 00:53:10,194
What do you mean?

888
00:53:10,267 --> 00:53:12,792
Ambition is
the mother of invention.

889
00:53:13,837 --> 00:53:17,136
A little something I
worked up during my exile.

890
00:53:18,308 --> 00:53:20,276
Amazing what
black powder can do,

891
00:53:20,344 --> 00:53:22,437
floating just beneath
the surface.

892
00:53:22,513 --> 00:53:24,504
A little demonstration.

893
00:53:29,386 --> 00:53:32,253
Off you go,
Your Highness.

894
00:53:41,665 --> 00:53:44,190
Of course, I can't just leave
them in the harbor waiting,

895
00:53:44,268 --> 00:53:46,133
or I'll blow up
my own ships.

896
00:53:46,203 --> 00:53:50,867
So I need to know something.
When is the King returning?

897
00:53:50,941 --> 00:53:51,965
He didn't say.

898
00:53:52,042 --> 00:53:55,842
But even if he had, I'd give
my own life before I'd tell you!

899
00:53:56,413 --> 00:53:58,745
But would you give
your sister's?

900
00:54:00,384 --> 00:54:01,715
Alexander!

901
00:54:01,785 --> 00:54:05,380
Surely you must know when
your father is returning!

902
00:54:05,455 --> 00:54:09,016
If you can manage to remember,

903
00:54:09,092 --> 00:54:12,084
I might consider
sparing the two of you.

904
00:54:20,137 --> 00:54:22,662
You have two hours
to think it over.

905
00:54:25,108 --> 00:54:28,043
Otherwise,
when the sand runs out,

906
00:54:28,745 --> 00:54:31,737
so do the Prince
and Princess.

907
00:54:38,021 --> 00:54:39,921
Put them in their cell.

908
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:45,426
Oh, Father,
who can help us now?

909
00:54:48,012 --> 00:54:50,298
<i>Papa's got a gumball, Nellie</i>
<i>Papa's got a gumball, Sue</i>

910
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:51,605
<i>Papa's got a gumball, Nellie</i>

911
00:54:51,606 --> 00:54:53,268
<i>I think I'll blow</i>
<i>a bubble for you</i>

912
00:54:53,337 --> 00:54:55,271
<i>Oh, Papa's got</i>
<i>a pork chop, Nellie,</i>

913
00:54:55,272 --> 00:54:56,431
<i>Papa's got a pork chop...</i>

914
00:54:56,506 --> 00:54:57,768
Will you stop that?

915
00:54:57,841 --> 00:54:59,900
What? It's a good song.
Don't you like it?

916
00:54:59,977 --> 00:55:03,413
After the 32nd verse,
it grates.

917
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:05,311
Besides,
it's making me hungry.

918
00:55:05,382 --> 00:55:06,291
Look at this.

919
00:55:06,292 --> 00:55:09,716
I suppose Robert's fortress
is beyond those peaks.

920
00:55:10,220 --> 00:55:12,484
But there's supposed
to be a pass.

921
00:55:12,556 --> 00:55:14,547
The Clapping Pass, right?

922
00:55:14,625 --> 00:55:17,150
Right.
I don't see anything.

923
00:55:17,227 --> 00:55:20,458
You think that's the Island
of Walking Rocks?

924
00:55:20,530 --> 00:55:24,466
It's got rocks, but they don't
appear to be going anywhere.

925
00:55:24,534 --> 00:55:26,559
Maybe it's poetic license.

926
00:55:31,942 --> 00:55:35,400
I'm going to look for the pass.
You hang out here.

927
00:55:49,192 --> 00:55:51,092
Walking rocks.

928
00:55:51,161 --> 00:55:53,527
<i>Look at us,</i>
<i>we're walking rocks</i>

929
00:55:53,597 --> 00:55:55,895
<i>We don't wear</i>
<i>any shoes or socks</i>

930
00:55:55,966 --> 00:55:57,297
La-la-la-la-la

931
00:56:07,477 --> 00:56:08,910
George?

932
00:56:08,979 --> 00:56:10,139
George!

933
00:56:17,187 --> 00:56:20,247
That must lead to the fortress.
Hey, Elliot!

934
00:56:20,323 --> 00:56:22,450
The rocks!

935
00:56:22,993 --> 00:56:24,119
Huh?

936
00:56:36,139 --> 00:56:37,697
There's another one!

937
00:56:45,382 --> 00:56:48,510
Do you think one of those
could crush a coconut?

938
00:56:48,585 --> 00:56:50,250
Are you kidding?

939
00:56:50,251 --> 00:56:52,885
One of those could
crush a Volkswagen!

940
00:57:01,031 --> 00:57:03,522
I think
we woke up Dad.

941
00:57:05,802 --> 00:57:08,828
Do you suppose he'll
put the kids on time-out?

942
00:57:09,806 --> 00:57:12,969
Not likely. It was nice
knowing you, Elliot!

943
00:57:13,043 --> 00:57:15,773
You too, George.
Thanks for the adventure.

944
00:57:15,846 --> 00:57:17,541
Don't mention it.

945
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:32,025
Sedgewick!

946
00:57:33,964 --> 00:57:36,455
Hey! I've been
looking for you.

947
00:57:36,533 --> 00:57:39,798
I followed the clues.
They worked out pretty well.

948
00:57:40,804 --> 00:57:42,533
That was a swim.

949
00:57:47,344 --> 00:57:49,005
Company?

950
00:57:50,614 --> 00:57:54,141
Oh, no.
I hate these guys!

951
00:58:10,767 --> 00:58:13,463
Sedgewick, keep it up.
I think they like it.

952
00:58:13,537 --> 00:58:18,600
Oh, sure, yeah. I'll just keep
running all day. No problem.

953
00:58:18,675 --> 00:58:22,133
Oh, it had to be me. It's not...
I am so tired... Would you...

954
00:58:24,047 --> 00:58:26,038
Somebody eat them.

955
00:58:26,550 --> 00:58:27,915
Would you?

956
00:58:41,298 --> 00:58:44,893
That was a good idea, swimming
over here with those...

957
00:58:44,968 --> 00:58:46,401
Whatever they are.

958
00:58:48,338 --> 00:58:51,398
Oh, no. We got to get
through there before it closes!

959
00:58:51,474 --> 00:58:52,771
What? Why?

960
00:58:52,843 --> 00:58:55,505
Robert has the Prince
and the Princess.

961
00:58:55,579 --> 00:58:56,739
Hang on.

962
00:58:56,813 --> 00:59:00,510
Now, this is the guy who wants
to crush us like coconuts, right?

963
00:59:00,584 --> 00:59:01,608
Uh-huh.

964
00:59:01,685 --> 00:59:05,018
And you're going to go in
there and stand up to him?

965
00:59:05,088 --> 00:59:06,180
Yep.

966
00:59:06,256 --> 00:59:07,917
And you're in
on this, too?

967
00:59:07,991 --> 00:59:09,117
Mmm.

968
00:59:11,494 --> 00:59:12,620
Okay.

969
00:59:16,433 --> 00:59:18,799
We go to row through
before it closes.

970
00:59:18,869 --> 00:59:20,427
I don't think
that's possible,

971
00:59:20,503 --> 00:59:21,902
and that's
coming from a guy

972
00:59:21,972 --> 00:59:25,430
who just swam 92 nautical
miles without arms or legs.

973
00:59:25,508 --> 00:59:27,999
Well, you got
a better idea?

974
00:59:36,620 --> 00:59:39,589
Yeah. We need to get through.
Can you help?

975
00:59:42,525 --> 00:59:45,722
What's he gonna do, chuck us
into the side of the mountain?

976
00:59:45,795 --> 00:59:47,729
We'll just have to
trust him.

977
00:59:47,797 --> 00:59:49,662
Trust him?
He's a rock!

978
01:00:02,279 --> 01:00:04,839
"Trust the rock,"
he says.

979
01:00:04,915 --> 01:00:06,644
I don't understand.

980
01:00:07,884 --> 01:00:09,146
Guys?

981
01:00:09,219 --> 01:00:14,020
We're not going to make
it. The pass is almost closed.

982
01:00:14,090 --> 01:00:15,990
Guys?

983
01:00:16,059 --> 01:00:18,926
"Trust the rock.
Trust the rock."

984
01:00:20,997 --> 01:00:22,726
Guys!
- What?

985
01:00:31,074 --> 01:00:32,132
Row!

986
01:00:51,761 --> 01:00:55,026
Oh, the Clapping Pass.
I get it.

987
01:00:58,001 --> 01:01:01,266
Must be some kind of a
secret bay or something.

988
01:01:01,338 --> 01:01:03,363
So, where's
this fortress?

989
01:01:04,607 --> 01:01:06,074
Oh.
Found it.

990
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:12,077
Won't they
see us coming?

991
01:01:12,148 --> 01:01:15,083
We're flying their flag.
We should be fine.

992
01:01:26,563 --> 01:01:28,554
There you go.
They got a garage!

993
01:01:28,631 --> 01:01:31,361
Well, that makes it easy.

994
01:01:31,434 --> 01:01:34,801
Too easy.
It's not guarded or anything.

995
01:01:34,871 --> 01:01:38,329
They don't need to guard
it. Nobody can find this place.

996
01:01:38,408 --> 01:01:39,466
Huh?

997
01:01:42,645 --> 01:01:44,704
Hey, guys?
There's bubbles.

998
01:02:00,697 --> 01:02:03,495
Look out!
He's going to eat us!

999
01:02:05,769 --> 01:02:07,259
Don't eat me!

1000
01:02:22,185 --> 01:02:23,880
Back off, serpent,

1001
01:02:24,621 --> 01:02:27,146
or taste my steel!

1002
01:02:29,826 --> 01:02:31,418
What?

1003
01:02:50,313 --> 01:02:51,644
Huh?

1004
01:02:57,187 --> 01:02:59,519
Hi, guys.
It's a contraption.

1005
01:02:59,589 --> 01:03:03,423
I found a big lever inside,
shut the whole thing down.

1006
01:03:03,493 --> 01:03:05,120
Pretty cool, huh?

1007
01:03:08,198 --> 01:03:09,290
Guys?

1008
01:03:15,472 --> 01:03:17,463
Oh, dear.

1009
01:03:17,540 --> 01:03:20,100
Like sand
through the hourglass,

1010
01:03:20,176 --> 01:03:24,237
so are the last few
minutes of our lives.

1011
01:03:30,887 --> 01:03:33,754
Okay, guys, let's
go get the Princess.

1012
01:03:40,964 --> 01:03:43,330
I'm hoping this will lead
up to the dungeon level,

1013
01:03:43,399 --> 01:03:46,664
and that's where we'll find
the Prince and Princess.

1014
01:03:50,740 --> 01:03:54,073
Wow!
Their dungeon has a swimming pool.

1015
01:03:54,144 --> 01:03:57,272
Oh, no.
It's a cistern.

1016
01:03:57,347 --> 01:03:59,713
A what?
Their supply of drinking water.

1017
01:03:59,782 --> 01:04:02,012
So they could last for
months during a battle.

1018
01:04:02,085 --> 01:04:03,882
The dungeon must be
on the next level up.

1019
01:04:03,953 --> 01:04:05,978
Hey! I found
the stairs.

1020
01:04:11,361 --> 01:04:12,658
Hmm.

1021
01:04:15,465 --> 01:04:18,866
So, what are we going to do
when we get to the dungeon?

1022
01:04:18,935 --> 01:04:22,302
Huh? Oh, I haven't
figured that part out yet.

1023
01:04:22,372 --> 01:04:25,239
Oh, good.
I was thinking we had a plan.

1024
01:04:30,446 --> 01:04:32,607
Hey, I think we're there.

1025
01:04:34,117 --> 01:04:35,880
It's locked.

1026
01:04:35,952 --> 01:04:38,546
Yep, this
is the dungeon, all right.

1027
01:04:38,621 --> 01:04:40,851
And look!
There's the Princess!

1028
01:04:41,291 --> 01:04:44,226
Princess Eloise!
Princess Eloise!

1029
01:04:45,762 --> 01:04:47,787
What?
- It's...

1030
01:04:47,864 --> 01:04:49,354
Who is it?
It's...

1031
01:04:49,432 --> 01:04:50,990
Our heroes!

1032
01:04:51,067 --> 01:04:53,262
We've come
to rescue you.

1033
01:04:54,304 --> 01:04:56,101
Do you have the keys?

1034
01:05:03,413 --> 01:05:05,847
If only we could
get real small.

1035
01:05:18,428 --> 01:05:20,055
That is one neat toy.

1036
01:05:20,129 --> 01:05:23,565
It is not a toy.
It's a labor-saving device.

1037
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,991
Come on!
Time's a-wastin'!

1038
01:05:55,965 --> 01:05:57,296
Huh? Huh?

1039
01:06:26,596 --> 01:06:28,723
What manner of magic
is this?

1040
01:06:28,798 --> 01:06:30,390
It's not magic.

1041
01:06:31,167 --> 01:06:32,862
It's RadioShack!

1042
01:06:44,681 --> 01:06:46,876
All right, quickly!

1043
01:06:48,518 --> 01:06:50,418
I knew you'd come back.

1044
01:06:57,393 --> 01:06:59,224
We got to go.
Follow me.

1045
01:07:00,396 --> 01:07:01,954
Quick! The keys!

1046
01:07:02,031 --> 01:07:03,828
But this way is...
Now!

1047
01:07:10,873 --> 01:07:12,534
Time's up.

1048
01:07:12,608 --> 01:07:15,270
Hello! What's this?

1049
01:07:15,678 --> 01:07:18,613
Someone wanted to
spoil my fun?

1050
01:07:18,681 --> 01:07:19,875
Surely not you?

1051
01:07:19,949 --> 01:07:22,008
Oh, no, sir.

1052
01:07:22,919 --> 01:07:24,716
Then you three?

1053
01:07:26,689 --> 01:07:29,590
They're heroes
sent by my father.

1054
01:07:29,659 --> 01:07:31,718
They'll be your undoing.

1055
01:07:33,196 --> 01:07:37,292
The King's heroes?
Then you can answer my question.

1056
01:07:37,367 --> 01:07:39,392
When will the King return?

1057
01:07:40,336 --> 01:07:42,167
He didn't
mention it to us.

1058
01:07:42,238 --> 01:07:43,364
It didn't come up.

1059
01:07:43,439 --> 01:07:46,602
Surely the King's heroes
would know of his plans!

1060
01:07:46,676 --> 01:07:48,701
Tell me
when the King will return,

1061
01:07:48,778 --> 01:07:51,144
or say goodbye
to the Princess.

1062
01:07:52,382 --> 01:07:55,510
Let her go!
We're not the King's heroes.

1063
01:07:55,585 --> 01:07:57,849
We're not heroes at all.

1064
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:00,354
It was all
a misunderstanding.

1065
01:08:01,591 --> 01:08:02,819
Explain.

1066
01:08:03,593 --> 01:08:06,289
We're no heroes.
We're cabin boys.

1067
01:08:06,362 --> 01:08:09,820
We work in a restaurant.
We clear dishes. We clean up.

1068
01:08:09,899 --> 01:08:12,766
We give people refills
on their soft drinks.

1069
01:08:12,835 --> 01:08:15,326
That's right.
The King's heroes?

1070
01:08:15,405 --> 01:08:18,340
He's so lazy, he can't even
climb a ladder without giving up.

1071
01:08:18,408 --> 01:08:21,844
Yeah, and he's scared of everything.

1072
01:08:21,911 --> 01:08:24,937
Spiders, snakes,
wicker furniture.

1073
01:08:25,014 --> 01:08:26,072
It's true.

1074
01:08:26,149 --> 01:08:27,241
And George there,

1075
01:08:27,316 --> 01:08:31,275
he's such a wimp, even his
own son thinks he's a loser.

1076
01:08:32,388 --> 01:08:34,049
Isn't that right?

1077
01:08:39,695 --> 01:08:41,128
Is it true?

1078
01:08:45,268 --> 01:08:46,929
It's true.

1079
01:08:47,003 --> 01:08:50,996
The ball made a mistake.
We're no heroes. We're...

1080
01:08:53,709 --> 01:08:56,337
<i>When all hope is gone,</i>

1081
01:08:56,412 --> 01:09:02,214
<i>help will come from above</i>
<i>in the shape of a donkey.</i>

1082
01:09:03,119 --> 01:09:04,609
Donkeys.

1083
01:09:04,687 --> 01:09:07,349
We're not donkeys.
We're cabin boys.

1084
01:09:14,030 --> 01:09:15,861
But even cabin boys

1085
01:09:17,366 --> 01:09:19,357
can do what's right!

1086
01:09:27,977 --> 01:09:29,342
Follow me!

1087
01:09:36,319 --> 01:09:38,048
Elliot! The ball!

1088
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:39,382
Here.

1089
01:09:47,997 --> 01:09:50,557
We really
need help right now.

1090
01:09:56,939 --> 01:09:58,463
Get in!
What?

1091
01:10:00,877 --> 01:10:02,708
Everybody, lean!

1092
01:10:05,014 --> 01:10:07,073
No! Get them!

1093
01:10:13,289 --> 01:10:16,452
It's more fun if you hold
your hands in the air.

1094
01:10:24,333 --> 01:10:25,322
What was that?

1095
01:10:25,401 --> 01:10:28,063
The drain.
We're getting out of here!

1096
01:10:31,107 --> 01:10:32,904
I'm feeling flushed!

1097
01:10:39,348 --> 01:10:41,475
You've got to be kidding!

1098
01:10:42,752 --> 01:10:44,686
Quick! To the ship!

1099
01:10:45,821 --> 01:10:47,345
Whoa!

1100
01:10:50,393 --> 01:10:52,293
What a ride!
You did it!

1101
01:10:52,361 --> 01:10:56,229
We're not done yet.
Row! Row like the wind!

1102
01:11:04,707 --> 01:11:07,175
We've got company!

1103
01:11:08,844 --> 01:11:12,177
Row! Row! Row!

1104
01:11:12,248 --> 01:11:16,878
Can I ask where we're rowing to?
The pass is closed!

1105
01:11:16,953 --> 01:11:19,854
It could open up at any second.
Keep rowing!

1106
01:11:21,757 --> 01:11:24,749
A noble
but pointless effort.

1107
01:11:24,827 --> 01:11:27,057
Gentlemen, take them out.

1108
01:11:34,971 --> 01:11:37,269
This is not
going so well.

1109
01:11:37,340 --> 01:11:39,740
Unless that pass opens up,
we're doomed.

1110
01:11:39,809 --> 01:11:41,834
We can't
get much further.

1111
01:11:44,313 --> 01:11:47,248
Is there anything
that ball can do now?

1112
01:11:47,316 --> 01:11:49,807
We really need help.

1113
01:11:49,885 --> 01:11:51,580
Help!

1114
01:11:51,654 --> 01:11:53,986
Nothing.
It's not blinking.

1115
01:11:54,056 --> 01:11:57,958
They're in range now, boys.
Finish them.

1116
01:12:01,964 --> 01:12:03,397
Whoa!

1117
01:12:10,006 --> 01:12:11,997
What is it?
I don't know.

1118
01:12:18,781 --> 01:12:20,214
Father!

1119
01:12:22,218 --> 01:12:24,209
It can't be!

1120
01:12:24,286 --> 01:12:27,346
You know what to do, men.
Watch your aim.

1121
01:12:27,423 --> 01:12:29,414
Quickly!
Disable the ship!

1122
01:12:35,965 --> 01:12:38,399
Where are you going?
Back to your posts!

1123
01:12:38,467 --> 01:12:40,332
Return fire!

1124
01:12:40,403 --> 01:12:43,201
Against the King's men?
You are mad!

1125
01:12:48,411 --> 01:12:50,470
Men, hold your fire.

1126
01:12:51,380 --> 01:12:54,611
On my word, Brother,
I'm not finished!

1127
01:12:54,684 --> 01:13:00,145
I'll never be finished until
that crown is on my head!

1128
01:13:17,239 --> 01:13:21,198
For amazing tenacity,
unwillingness to give up.

1129
01:13:24,980 --> 01:13:29,883
For extraordinary bravery
in the face of grave danger.

1130
01:13:33,823 --> 01:13:38,590
For leadership and cunning
in a time of great peril.

1131
01:13:54,310 --> 01:13:56,244
You wish to speak?

1132
01:13:56,879 --> 01:14:00,815
We're glad we could help.
Your kids are real sweet.

1133
01:14:00,883 --> 01:14:04,046
But the ball,
it doesn't work right.

1134
01:14:04,120 --> 01:14:07,248
We're no heroes.
We're cabin boys.

1135
01:14:07,757 --> 01:14:09,918
There were no mistakes.

1136
01:14:09,992 --> 01:14:14,088
The Helpseeker picked
exactly whom I intended.

1137
01:14:14,163 --> 01:14:19,567
And I made sure you had everything
you needed to complete the task.

1138
01:14:19,935 --> 01:14:23,166
The crab that
showed you the way,

1139
01:14:23,239 --> 01:14:26,174
the lever that
saved your friends.

1140
01:14:26,709 --> 01:14:29,041
The donkey from above.

1141
01:14:30,112 --> 01:14:34,276
The adventure I call you to
may not be easy,

1142
01:14:34,350 --> 01:14:37,217
but you'll never
journey alone.

1143
01:14:37,286 --> 01:14:39,914
My help is always there.

1144
01:14:41,056 --> 01:14:44,457
When we were on the island, the
ball said it was time to go home.

1145
01:14:44,527 --> 01:14:49,624
That was a test, which you
passed with flying colors.

1146
01:14:50,432 --> 01:14:55,301
Sometimes, a test helps us
decide what matters most.

1147
01:14:55,838 --> 01:14:59,672
The hero isn't the
strongest or the fastest

1148
01:14:59,742 --> 01:15:02,438
or the smartest
or the best-looking.

1149
01:15:03,078 --> 01:15:08,209
The hero is the one who,
no matter how hard,

1150
01:15:08,284 --> 01:15:11,117
does what he knows
is right.

1151
01:15:12,121 --> 01:15:13,679
Monteria!

1152
01:15:13,756 --> 01:15:16,782
I give you three heroes!

1153
01:15:32,641 --> 01:15:34,939
Are you sure
you don't want to stay?

1154
01:15:35,010 --> 01:15:38,070
We can always use
a few more heroes.

1155
01:15:38,147 --> 01:15:40,581
No. I want to
see my kids.

1156
01:15:40,649 --> 01:15:41,638
And my Ellen!

1157
01:15:41,717 --> 01:15:42,979
And Bernadette!

1158
01:15:43,052 --> 01:15:45,145
Fare thee well, friends.

1159
01:15:45,221 --> 01:15:47,849
Your work here
is done.

1160
01:15:50,626 --> 01:15:52,389
Sure enough.

1161
01:15:55,264 --> 01:15:56,595
Hang on.

1162
01:16:00,936 --> 01:16:04,235
You know, I liked them
from the very beginning.

1163
01:16:10,946 --> 01:16:14,040
We're back. The show's
on! It must be Friday.

1164
01:16:14,583 --> 01:16:16,107
I got to
find my kids.

1165
01:16:16,185 --> 01:16:17,743
And the girls!

1166
01:16:29,798 --> 01:16:32,892
<i>Our shirts are loose</i>
<i>Our pants are tight</i>

1167
01:16:32,968 --> 01:16:34,799
<i>It's Spanish gold</i>
<i>for all tonight</i>

1168
01:16:34,870 --> 01:16:36,303
<i>It's Spanish gold</i>
<i>for all tonight</i>

1169
01:16:36,372 --> 01:16:38,340
Caroline! Kids!

1170
01:16:40,376 --> 01:16:41,934
There they are!

1171
01:16:45,447 --> 01:16:48,143
It's a fine night
for a pirate fight.

1172
01:16:49,585 --> 01:16:51,746
<i>It's Spanish gold</i>
<i>for all tonight</i>

1173
01:16:51,820 --> 01:16:53,913
<i>So bring</i>
<i>a hearty appetite</i>

1174
01:16:53,989 --> 01:16:57,015
<i>Our aim is true</i>
<i>Our cause is right</i>

1175
01:16:57,092 --> 01:16:59,253
<i>It's Spanish gold</i>
<i>for all tonight</i>

1176
01:16:59,328 --> 01:17:02,058
Oh, no! He thinks
Sir Frederick is me!

1177
01:17:07,970 --> 01:17:09,801
<i>It's Spanish gold</i>
<i>for all tonight</i>

1178
01:17:09,872 --> 01:17:12,033
<i>As Spaniards quake</i>
<i>to see the sight</i>

1179
01:17:12,107 --> 01:17:15,008
<i>Our flag unfurled</i>
<i>with black and white</i>

1180
01:17:15,077 --> 01:17:16,942
<i>It's Spanish...</i>

1181
01:17:17,012 --> 01:17:18,343
Hey!

1182
01:17:21,517 --> 01:17:25,248
There's no King to
save you now, cabin boy!

1183
01:17:25,321 --> 01:17:27,050
Elliot! The ball!

1184
01:17:27,122 --> 01:17:28,248
It's blinking!

1185
01:17:30,326 --> 01:17:31,691
Here it is.

1186
01:17:44,974 --> 01:17:46,305
Stall him!

1187
01:17:47,443 --> 01:17:49,377
Andy! Trigger B!

1188
01:17:57,653 --> 01:18:01,214
Say hello to my little friend.
Take that!

1189
01:18:02,424 --> 01:18:03,652
Whoa!

1190
01:18:04,259 --> 01:18:05,487
No!

1191
01:18:06,328 --> 01:18:08,057
Enough tricks!

1192
01:18:11,433 --> 01:18:12,923
A little help?

1193
01:18:17,740 --> 01:18:19,230
Ouch.

1194
01:18:20,542 --> 01:18:22,271
Time to go home.

1195
01:18:22,344 --> 01:18:23,936
Uh-oh.

1196
01:18:31,787 --> 01:18:33,812
All right!

1197
01:18:33,889 --> 01:18:35,652
That's my dad!

1198
01:18:35,724 --> 01:18:37,954
Can I come over
to your house?

1199
01:18:50,472 --> 01:18:52,736
I'd like to rethink
your auditions.

1200
01:18:52,808 --> 01:18:55,777
You could really add
something to the show.

1201
01:19:03,052 --> 01:19:06,249
I don't think we need
to be in the show after all.

1202
01:19:07,456 --> 01:19:10,254
Life has plenty of
adventure of its own.

1203
01:19:29,711 --> 01:19:33,545
<i>Argh, argh, argh, argh</i>

1204
01:19:33,615 --> 01:19:37,449
<i>We are The Pirates</i>
<i>Who Don't Do Anything</i>

1205
01:19:37,519 --> 01:19:40,215
<i>We just stay at home</i>
<i>and lie around</i>

1206
01:19:40,289 --> 01:19:43,383
<i>And if you ask us</i>
<i>to do anything</i>

1207
01:19:43,459 --> 01:19:46,485
<i>We'll just tell you</i>
<i>We don't do anything</i>

1208
01:19:46,562 --> 01:19:48,245
<i>But I've never been</i>
<i>to Greenland</i>

1209
01:19:48,246 --> 01:19:49,463
<i>And I've never been to Denver</i>

1210
01:19:49,531 --> 01:19:52,523
<i>And I've never buried treasure</i>
<i>in St. Louis or St. Paul</i>

1211
01:19:52,601 --> 01:19:54,159
<i>And I've never been to Moscow</i>

1212
01:19:54,236 --> 01:19:55,760
<i>And I've never been to Tampa</i>

1213
01:19:55,838 --> 01:19:58,534
<i>And I've never been</i>
<i>to Boston in the fall</i>

1214
01:19:58,607 --> 01:20:01,337
<i>Hold on.</i>
<i>We're not quite done.</i>

1215
01:20:06,281 --> 01:20:07,509
<i>Skeedoodlee bop</i>

1216
01:20:08,283 --> 01:20:09,750
<i>Ooh, skedoodlee bop</i>

1217
01:20:11,453 --> 01:20:13,114
<i>We landed on a beach</i>

1218
01:20:14,189 --> 01:20:16,851
<i>We were looking</i>
<i>for the Clapping Pass</i>

1219
01:20:16,925 --> 01:20:19,519
<i>Something came up</i>
<i>behind us</i>

1220
01:20:19,595 --> 01:20:22,291
<i>It was a Rock Monster!</i>

1221
01:20:27,202 --> 01:20:28,726
<i>Rock Monster!</i>

1222
01:20:32,641 --> 01:20:34,074
<i>Rock Monster</i>

1223
01:20:38,313 --> 01:20:40,907
<i>We were on the beach</i>

1224
01:20:40,983 --> 01:20:43,474
<i>I was running</i>
<i>from evil cheese</i>

1225
01:20:43,552 --> 01:20:45,816
<i>They were trying to eat me up</i>

1226
01:20:45,888 --> 01:20:48,789
<i>But they ran into a rock</i>

1227
01:20:49,091 --> 01:20:50,922
<i>But it wasn't a rock</i>

1228
01:20:51,460 --> 01:20:54,122
<i>It was a Rock Monster!</i>

1229
01:20:59,067 --> 01:21:00,398
<i>Rock Monster!</i>

1230
01:21:04,439 --> 01:21:05,963
<i>Rock Monster</i>

1231
01:21:09,878 --> 01:21:12,346
<i>Rock Monster</i>

1232
01:21:12,414 --> 01:21:15,042
<i>Rock Monster!</i>

1233
01:21:15,117 --> 01:21:16,607
<i>It tossed us in the ocean</i>

1234
01:21:17,553 --> 01:21:19,214
<i>In a pirate dinghy</i>

1235
01:21:20,589 --> 01:21:21,988
<i>Here he comes</i>

1236
01:21:23,058 --> 01:21:24,616
<i>He's on the run</i>

1237
01:21:25,827 --> 01:21:27,055
<i>40 feet tall</i>

1238
01:21:28,497 --> 01:21:30,488
<i>Here comes a cannonball!</i>

1239
01:21:37,005 --> 01:21:39,303
<i>Rock, Rock...</i>

1240
01:21:41,977 --> 01:21:43,205
<i>Rock Monster!</i>

1241
01:21:43,278 --> 01:21:44,870
<i>Monster, Rock Monster</i>

1242
01:21:44,947 --> 01:21:47,541
<i>Monster,</i>

01:22:01,930 --> 01:22:03,898
<i>All right.</i>
<i>That's a wrap.</i>

1246
01:22:16,979 --> 01:22:18,844
<i>One, two, three</i>

1247
01:22:19,348 --> 01:22:23,284
<i>You ain't got nothing left</i>
<i>to prove today</i>

1248
01:22:23,619 --> 01:22:27,578

<i>About to drop us like a habit</i>

1255
01:22:49,144 --> 01:22:51,772
<i>The future's ours</i>
<i>if we just grab it</i>

1256
01:22:53,415 --> 01:22:56,509
<i>Don't need no clutch</i>
<i>It's automatic</i>

1257
01:22:56,885 --> 01:23:01,185
<i>We just can't ignore</i>
<i>what we came here for</i>

1258
01:23:01,857 --> 01:23:04,690
<i>It's only fear</i>
<i>that would prevent us</i>

1259
01:23:06,194 --> 01:23:09,095
<i>All that we need</i>
<i>is deep within us</i>

1260
