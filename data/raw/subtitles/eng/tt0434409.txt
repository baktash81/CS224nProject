The 5th of November</i>

<i>The gunpowder treason and plot</i>

3
00:00:48,216 --> 00:00:50,635
<i>I know of no reason
Why the gunpowder treason</i>

4
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,679
<i>Should ever be forgot</i>

5
00:00:55,932 --> 00:00:57,684
<i>But what of the man?</i>

6
00:00:59,185 --> 00:01:01,229
<i>I know his name was Guy Fawkes</i>

7
00:01:01,313 --> 00:01:05,400
<i>and I know in 1605, he attempted
to blow up the Houses of Parliament.</i>

8
00:01:06,401 --> 00:01:08,695
<i>But who was he really?</i>

9
00:01:08,778 --> 00:01:10,280
<i>What was he like?</i>

[woman] <i>We are told to remember
the idea and not the man.</i>

12
00:01:20,707 --> 00:01:22,334
<i>Because a man can fail.</i>

13
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:27,505
<i>He can be caught,
he can be killed and forgotten.</i>

14
00:01:27,672 --> 00:01:29,758
<i>But 400 years later</i>

15
00:01:29,841 --> 00:01:32,636

16
00:01:34,095 --> 00:01:37,182
<i>I have witnessed firsthand
the power of ideas.</i>

17
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:40,101

in the name of them...</i>

<i>But you cannot kiss an idea</i>

21
00:01:48,318 --> 00:01:51,279

22
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:56,076
<i>Ideas do not bleed.
They do not feel pain.</i>

23
00:01:56,409 --> 00:01:58,328
<i>They do not love.</i>

24
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:03,750
<i>And it is not an idea that I miss.</i>

25
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:05,877
<i>It is a man.</i>

26
00:02:05,961 --> 00:02:09,589
<i>A man that made me remember
the 5th of November.</i>

27
00:02:09,673 --> 00:02:11,800
<i>A man that I will never forget.</i>

28
00:02:24,729 --> 00:02:30,235
<i>So I read that the former United States
is so desperate for medical supplies</i>

29

<i>that they have allegedly sent several
containers filled with wheat and tobacco.</i>

30

32
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,916
<i>Well, you're listening to my show,
so I will assume you do.</i>

33
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,461
<i>It's high time we let the colonies know
what we really think of them.</i>

34
00:02:48,545 --> 00:02:52,882
<i>I think it's payback time for a tea party
they threw for us a few hundred years ago.</i>

42

<i>Godlessness.</i>

47

<i>It wasn't the war they started.
It wasn't the plague they created.</i>

48

- Whoa! Excuse me.
- Sorry, I didn't see you...

69
00:04:39,614 --> 00:04:41,366
- In a hurry, are we?
- I was just...

70
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:44,244
- It's past curfew, you know.
- My uncle, he's very sick.

71
00:04:44,327 --> 00:04:47,956
- Sick uncle? What you think, Willy?
- It's a load of bollocks.

72
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:51,126
I made a mistake. I shouldn't be out
after curfew. I know that.

73
00:04:51,209 --> 00:04:54,587
Maybe you could look after us
before getting back to your uncle.

74
00:04:54,671 --> 00:04:56,923
[man] See, my friend, he's kind of sick.
Ain't you?

75
00:04:57,006 --> 00:04:59,926
Real sick. Bad case of the blues.
You can feel them.

- Don't touch me!
- Look, Willy, kitty's got claws.

77

- She just threatened us.
- That she did, that she did.

78
00:05:06,766 --> 00:05:08,476
You know what that means,
don't you?

79
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,354
It means that we exercise
our own judicial discretion.

80
00:05:11,771 --> 00:05:13,398
And you get to swallow it.

81
00:05:13,481 --> 00:05:15,721
- Oh, God, you're Fingermen.
- She's getting the picture.

82
00:05:15,775 --> 00:05:17,569
No, please, I didn't know. I'm sorry.

83

Not yet you're not. But you will be.

Oh, God, no. Please don't do this.

87
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:34,460
I'll go home.
I won't do it again, I swear! Please!

- [Willy] Bugger off!

Disdaining fortune,

We're Fingermen, pal.

102
00:06:35,605 --> 00:06:38,358
- What's that mean?
- Spare the rod.

103
00:06:40,151 --> 00:06:41,361
[truncheon drops]

104
00:06:44,239 --> 00:06:46,032
I can assure you, I mean you no harm.

105
00:06:46,115 --> 00:06:47,867
- Who are you?
- Who?

106
00:06:47,951 --> 00:06:50,495
Who is but the form
following the function of what

107
00:06:50,578 --> 00:06:52,497
and what I am is a man in a mask.

108
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,666
- Oh, I can see that.
- Of course you can.

109
00:06:54,874 --> 00:06:57,043
I'm not questioning your powers
of observation.

110
00:06:57,126 --> 00:07:01,256
I'm merely remarking upon the paradox
of asking a masked man who he is.

111
00:07:01,714 --> 00:07:06,094
- Oh. Right.
- But on this most auspicious of nights

112
00:07:06,177 --> 00:07:09,555
permit me then, in lieu of
the more commonplace sobriquet

113
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:12,850
to suggest the character
of this dramatis persona.

114
00:07:14,018 --> 00:07:15,645
VoilÃ !

115
00:07:15,728 --> 00:07:17,814
In view, a humble
vaudevillian veteran

116
00:07:17,897 --> 00:07:22,151
cast vicariously as both victim
and villain by the vicissitudes of fate.

117
00:07:22,235 --> 00:07:25,029
This visage,
no mere veneer of vanity

118
00:07:25,113 --> 00:07:28,700
is a vestige of the vox populi,
now vacant, vanished.

119
00:07:28,783 --> 00:07:33,204
However, this valorous visitation
of a bygone vexation stands vivified

120
00:07:33,288 --> 00:07:37,292
and has vowed to vanquish these venal
and virulent vermin vanguarding vice

121
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:41,045
and vouchsafing the violently vicious
and voracious violation of volition.

122
00:07:47,218 --> 00:07:50,388
The only verdict is vengeance,
a vendetta

123
00:07:50,471 --> 00:07:54,350
held as a votive not in vain,
for the value and veracity of such

124
00:07:54,434 --> 00:07:57,687
shall one day vindicate the vigilant
and the virtuous.

125
00:07:59,355 --> 00:08:00,815
[V chuckles]

126
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:04,235
Verily, this vichyssoise of verbiage
veers most verbose.

127
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,322
So let me simply add that it's
my very good honor to meet you

128
00:08:07,405 --> 00:08:09,157
and you may call me V.

129
00:08:11,451 --> 00:08:13,453
Are you, like, a crazy person?

130
00:08:13,536 --> 00:08:15,663
I am quite sure they will say so.

131
00:08:15,747 --> 00:08:17,749
But to whom, might I ask,
am I speaking?

132
00:08:19,584 --> 00:08:21,836
- I'm Evey.
- Evey?

133
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,339
E-vey. Of course you are.

134
00:08:24,881 --> 00:08:27,258
- What does that mean?
- It means that I, like God,

135
00:08:27,342 --> 00:08:30,636
do not play with dice
and do not believe in coincidence.

136
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,638
Are you hurt?

137
00:08:32,722 --> 00:08:34,474
No, I'm fine.

138
00:08:35,266 --> 00:08:38,353
- Thanks to you.
- Oh, I merely played my part.

139
00:08:38,436 --> 00:08:42,231
- But tell me, do you enjoy music, Evey?
- I suppose.

140
00:08:42,315 --> 00:08:44,442
You see, I'm a musician of sorts

141
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:46,986
and on my way to give
a very special performance.

142
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:48,696
What kind of musician?

143
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,782
Percussion instruments are my speciality.

144
00:08:50,865 --> 00:08:54,285
But tonight I intend to call upon
the entire orchestra for this event

145
00:08:54,369 --> 00:08:56,496
and would be honored
if you could join me.

146
00:08:56,579 --> 00:08:58,790
I don't think so.
I should be getting home.

147
00:08:58,873 --> 00:09:01,501
I promise you, it'll be like
nothing you've ever seen.

148
00:09:01,584 --> 00:09:04,420
And afterwards,
you'll return home safely.

149
00:09:06,798 --> 00:09:07,840
All right.

150
00:09:09,884 --> 00:09:11,260
[Evey] It's beautiful up here.

151
00:09:11,761 --> 00:09:15,807
[V] A more perfect stage
could not be asked for.

152
00:09:16,015 --> 00:09:17,517
I don't see any instruments.

153
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,561
Your powers of observation
continue to serve you well.

154
00:09:21,312 --> 00:09:26,025
But wait. It is to Madame Justice
that I dedicate this concerto

155
00:09:26,109 --> 00:09:29,487
in honor of the holiday she seems
to have taken from these parts

156
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:33,658
and in recognition of the impostor
that stands in her stead.

157
00:09:34,534 --> 00:09:37,036
Tell me, do you know
what day it is, Evey?

158
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,287
Um...

159
00:09:38,371 --> 00:09:41,624
- November the 4th?
- Not anymore.

160
00:09:41,707 --> 00:09:43,835
[bells chiming]

161
00:09:47,463 --> 00:09:51,050
<i>Remember, remember
The 5th of November</i>

162
00:09:51,134 --> 00:09:54,303
<i>The gunpowder treason and plot</i>

163
00:09:54,387 --> 00:09:57,432
<i>I know of no reason
Why the gunpowder treason</i>

164
00:09:57,515 --> 00:10:00,101
<i>Should ever be forgot</i>

165
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:06,816
First, the overture.

166
00:10:07,775 --> 00:10:09,861
Yes.

167
00:10:10,653 --> 00:10:12,321
Yes, the strings.

168
00:10:14,198 --> 00:10:15,950
Listen carefully, can you hear it?

169
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,245
Now the brass.

170
00:10:19,328 --> 00:10:21,164
I can hear it!

171
00:10:21,247 --> 00:10:24,917
[Tchaikovsky's "1812 Overture"
playing over speakers]

172
00:10:27,086 --> 00:10:30,214
Look outside, Mommy!
They're playing music!

173
00:10:34,886 --> 00:10:37,096
- How do you do that?
- Wait.

174
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:39,140
Here comes the crescendo!

175
00:10:44,103 --> 00:10:45,605
[V laughing]

176
00:10:46,898 --> 00:10:49,233
How beautiful, is it not?

177
00:11:00,786 --> 00:11:05,082
<i>Gentlemen, you have had four hours.
You had better have results. Mr. Creedy.</i>

178
00:11:06,417 --> 00:11:08,211
The Bailey area is quarantined.

179
00:11:08,294 --> 00:11:10,630
All significant witnesses
have been detained.

180
00:11:10,713 --> 00:11:12,006
<i>Good. Mr. Etheridge?</i>

181
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:16,219
A recording device was found wired into
the central emergency-broadcast system.

182
00:11:16,302 --> 00:11:19,138
The DCD was Tchaikovsky's
<i>1812 Overture.</i>

183
00:11:19,222 --> 00:11:21,766
<i>Add it to the blacklist.
I never want to hear that music again.</i>

184
00:11:21,849 --> 00:11:23,142
Yes, sir.

185
00:11:23,226 --> 00:11:27,063
We also doubled our random sweeps
and are monitoring phone surveillance

186
00:11:27,146 --> 00:11:30,816
indicating a high percentage
of conversation about the explosion.

187
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,902
<i>Mr. Dascomb,
what are we doing about that?</i>

188
00:11:32,985 --> 00:11:35,571
We're calling it
an emergency demolition.

189
00:11:35,655 --> 00:11:38,699
We have spin coverage on the network
and throughout the InterLink.

190
00:11:38,783 --> 00:11:43,079
Experts have been lined up to testify
against the Bailey's structural integrity.

191
00:11:43,162 --> 00:11:46,207
<i>I want Prothero to speak on
the dangers of these old buildings</i>

192
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:49,835
<i>and how we must avoid clinging
to the edifice of a decadent past.</i>

193
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:53,673
<i>He should conclude that the New Bailey
will become the symbol of our time</i>

194
00:11:53,756 --> 00:11:56,968
<i>and the future
that our conviction has rewarded us.</i>

195
00:11:57,176 --> 00:11:58,386
<i>Mr. Heyer.</i>

196
00:11:58,469 --> 00:12:01,764
Our surveillance cameras captured
several images of the terrorist

197
00:12:01,847 --> 00:12:05,309
though the mask obviously makes
retinal identification impossible.

198
00:12:05,393 --> 00:12:10,606
We also managed to get a picture of
the girl that Creedy's men were detaining.

199
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:13,109
<i>- Who is she, Mr. Finch?</i>
- Not sure yet, sir.

200
00:12:13,192 --> 00:12:15,820
- But we're working on several leads.
<i>- Anything else?</i>

201
00:12:15,903 --> 00:12:17,780
We located the fireworks launch

202
00:12:17,863 --> 00:12:20,825
and found traces
of the explosives used at both sites.

203
00:12:20,908 --> 00:12:26,247
Unfortunately it appears that despite
the heavy level of sophistication

204
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:30,126
these devices were homemade
with over-the-counter chemicals

205
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:32,753
making them very difficult to trace.

206
00:12:34,005 --> 00:12:36,757
Whoever he is, chancellor,
he's very good.

207
00:12:36,966 --> 00:12:40,344
<i>Spare us your professional annotations,
Mr. Finch. They are irrelevant.</i>

208
00:12:40,428 --> 00:12:42,221
Apologies, chancellor.

209
00:12:42,305 --> 00:12:44,015
<i>Gentlemen, this is a test.</i>

210
00:12:44,098 --> 00:12:46,851
<i>Moments such as these
are matters of faith.</i>

211
00:12:46,934 --> 00:12:50,229
<i>To fail is to invite doubt
into everything we believe,</i>

212
00:12:50,313 --> 00:12:52,023
<i>everything we have fought for.</i>

213
00:12:52,231 --> 00:12:57,153
<i>Doubt will plunge this country back
into chaos, and I will not let that happen.</i>

214
00:12:57,236 --> 00:12:59,864
<i>Gentlemen, I want this
terrorist found</i>

215
00:12:59,947 --> 00:13:04,410
<i>and I want him to understand
what terror really means.</i>

216
00:13:04,493 --> 00:13:05,995
<i>England prevails.</i>

217
00:13:06,454 --> 00:13:08,748
[all] England prevails.

[TV theme music plays]

219
00:13:14,962 --> 00:13:18,257
- [woman] You think people will buy this?
- [Dascomb] Why not?

220
00:13:18,341 --> 00:13:20,343
This is the BTN.

221
00:13:20,426 --> 00:13:23,220
Our job is to report the news,
not fabricate it.

222
00:13:23,971 --> 00:13:25,890
That's the government's job.

223
00:13:27,391 --> 00:13:29,143
On the lighter side of things

224
00:13:29,226 --> 00:13:32,855
seems that the crew responsible for
the demolition of the Old Bailey

225
00:13:32,938 --> 00:13:37,360
wanted to give the old girl a grand,
albeit improvised, sendoff.

226
00:13:37,443 --> 00:13:40,154
<i>Although the demolition had been
planned for some time</i>

227
00:13:40,237 --> 00:13:43,407
<i>the music and the fireworks were,
according to the crew chief,</i>

228
00:13:43,491 --> 00:13:46,452
<i>- "definitely not on the schedule."</i>
- [man on TV] <i>We'll be right back.</i>

229
00:13:46,535 --> 00:13:50,414
Do you believe that load of bollocks?
I mean, there was no bloody demolition.

230
00:13:50,498 --> 00:13:52,041
I saw it, the whole thing.

231
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,919
- Did you see it?
- No. Last night I was...

232
00:13:55,002 --> 00:13:58,381
Yeah, that's right. You went
to see Daddy Deitrich, didn't you?

233
00:13:59,131 --> 00:14:01,092
Evey, there you are.

234
00:14:01,175 --> 00:14:03,427
- You are still working for me.
- Sorry, Patricia.

235
00:14:03,511 --> 00:14:05,930
I need two espressos and three coffees.

236
00:14:06,013 --> 00:14:08,099
And Deitrich is ready for his tea.

237
00:14:10,309 --> 00:14:11,560
[man] I don't get it.

238
00:14:11,644 --> 00:14:14,188
Why does he wear a Guy Fawkes mask
and then blow up the Bailey?

239
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,871
Didn't Fawkes try to blow up Parliament?

240
00:14:15,898 --> 00:14:19,944
It's not too late.
He's still got another 16 hours.

241
00:14:20,361 --> 00:14:22,405
Maybe he's just getting started.

242
00:14:22,488 --> 00:14:24,031
[phone ringing]

243
00:14:24,115 --> 00:14:25,616
Yeah?

244
00:14:26,117 --> 00:14:28,119
Okay. A lead on the girl.

245
00:14:28,244 --> 00:14:31,205
[man] Look, don't get me wrong,
I love it. A cow getting crucified.

246
00:14:31,622 --> 00:14:34,583
It's hysterical.
But you'll never get it approved.

247
00:14:34,667 --> 00:14:37,420
You've got to rewrite it, okay? Gotta go.

248
00:14:38,462 --> 00:14:41,257
I don't recall getting stood up
by a more attractive woman.

249
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,134
- Mr. Deitrich...
- Gordon, please.

250
00:14:43,217 --> 00:14:45,845
I don't need "mister" to make
this body feel any older.

251

Gordon...

252
00:14:47,847 --> 00:14:50,766
I was on my way last night,
but there were Fingermen

253
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:52,518
and I got scared and went home.

254
00:14:52,601 --> 00:14:57,148
Sadly, after last night,
I think our curfew will only get worse.

255

Gotcha.

- Hey, Fred.
- [Fred] All that been x-rayed?

00:15:21,464 --> 00:15:23,382
Nope. They're filled with bombs.

258
00:15:23,466 --> 00:15:25,801
Well, wait till commercials
to set them off, okay?

259
00:15:27,136 --> 00:15:29,305
- I can't believe you watch that shit.
[Fred] What?

260
00:15:29,388 --> 00:15:31,390

Not sure. They just arrived.
Marked for Stage 3.

What the hell is this?

267
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:05,382
Just put them over there
until I can figure out what they're for.

We're gonna need backup,
but keep it minimal.

You sure about that, sir?

00:16:21,148 --> 00:16:22,691
I want a chance to talk to her

<i>Why? Because while the truncheon

321

Who's to blame?</i>

00:31:30,306 --> 00:31:31,599
Where did you get it?

500
00:31:31,808 --> 00:31:34,936
[V] A government supply train
on its way to Chancellor Sutler.

501
00:31:35,979 --> 00:31:38,815
- You stole this from Chancellor Sutler?
- Yes.

502
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,275
You're insane.

503
00:31:40,358 --> 00:31:44,320
[V] I dare do all that may become a man.
Who dares more is none.

504
00:31:44,404 --> 00:31:46,906
<i>- Macbeth.</i>
- Very good.

505
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:49,993
My mum, she used to
read all his plays to me

506
00:31:50,076 --> 00:31:52,454
and ever since,
I've always wanted to act.

507
00:31:52,537 --> 00:31:54,998
Be in plays, movies.

508
00:31:55,081 --> 00:31:58,752
When I was 9, I played Viola
in <i>Twelfth Night.</i> Mum was very proud.

509
00:31:58,835 --> 00:32:01,004
[V] Where is your mother now?

510
00:32:01,087 --> 00:32:02,964
She's dead.

511
00:32:03,047 --> 00:32:04,340
[V] I'm sorry.

512
00:32:06,634 --> 00:32:09,137
Can I ask about
what you said on the telly?

513
00:32:09,345 --> 00:32:10,930
- Did you mean it?
- Every word.

514
00:32:11,014 --> 00:32:15,059
You really think blowing up Parliament's
going to make this country a better place?

515
00:32:15,143 --> 00:32:17,520
[V] There's no certainty,
only opportunity.

516
00:32:17,604 --> 00:32:20,231
You can be pretty certain
that if anyone does show up,

517
00:32:20,315 --> 00:32:22,275
Creedy'll black-bag
every one of them.

518
00:32:22,567 --> 00:32:25,028
[V] People should not be afraid
of their governments.

519
00:32:25,111 --> 00:32:27,071
Governments should be afraid
of their people.

520
00:32:27,155 --> 00:32:29,616
And you'll make that happen
by blowing up a building?

521
00:32:30,867 --> 00:32:34,370
[V] The building is a symbol,
as is the act of destroying it.

522
00:32:34,454 --> 00:32:36,247
Symbols are given power by people.

523
00:32:36,873 --> 00:32:40,168
Alone, a symbol is meaningless,
but with enough people,

524
00:32:40,376 --> 00:32:43,004
blowing up a building
can change the world.

525
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,965
I wish I believed that was possible.

526
00:32:46,382 --> 00:32:50,678
Every time I've seen this world change,
it's always been for the worse.

527
00:32:50,887 --> 00:32:53,348
<i>I'll tell you what I know.
I know this is not a man.</i>

528
00:32:53,431 --> 00:32:54,891
[TV audience applauding]

529
00:32:54,974 --> 00:32:56,100
[Prothero] What is he?

530
00:32:56,184 --> 00:32:58,061
[Prothero on TV]
<i>A man does not wear a mask.</i>

531
00:32:58,144 --> 00:33:01,439
- What is he?
<i>- A man does not threaten civilians.</i>

532
00:33:01,898 --> 00:33:05,109
<i>He's what every gutless,
freedom-hating terrorist is:</i>

533
00:33:05,193 --> 00:33:07,529
<i>A goddamn coward!</i>

534
00:33:07,612 --> 00:33:09,614
[phone ringing]

535
00:33:10,532 --> 00:33:12,033
There will be no negotiation.

536
00:33:12,116 --> 00:33:14,702
When I arrive in the morning,
the Paddy will be gone.

537
00:33:14,786 --> 00:33:18,373
I'm looking at the tape right now,
and he has no idea how to light me.

538
00:33:18,456 --> 00:33:21,209
My nose looks like Big fucking Ben.

539
00:33:21,334 --> 00:33:24,879
Listen to me, you bleeding sod,
England prevails because I say it does!

540
00:33:24,963 --> 00:33:27,841
So does every lazy cunt on this show,
and that includes you.

541
00:33:27,924 --> 00:33:31,219
Find another DOP
or find yourself another job.

542
00:33:33,763 --> 00:33:35,306
<i>I'll tell you what I wish.</i>

543
00:33:35,807 --> 00:33:37,475
<i>I wish I'd been there.</i>

544
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:39,853
<i>I wish I'd had the chance
for a face-to-face.</i>

545
00:33:39,936 --> 00:33:42,397
<i>Just one chance, that's all I'd need.</i>

546
00:33:47,068 --> 00:33:51,030
<i>This so-called V and his accomplice,

<i>neo-demagogues,

548
00:33:54,576 --> 00:33:59,247
<i>A delusional and aberrant voice
delivering a terrorist's ultimatum.</i>

549
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:03,126
<i>An ultimatum that was met
with swift and surgically precise justice.</i>

550
00:34:03,209 --> 00:34:06,087
- No mercy!
<i>- The moral, ladies and gentlemen, is:</i>

551
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:08,464
[together]
Good guys win, bad guys lose

552
00:34:08,548 --> 00:34:11,968
and, as always, England prevails!

553
00:34:14,012 --> 00:34:15,972
Holy Christ! Jesus!

554
00:34:17,265 --> 00:34:19,225
Good evening, Commander Prothero.

555
00:34:19,309 --> 00:34:21,978
Oh, my God! How did you get in here?

556
00:34:22,061 --> 00:34:25,273
Don't worry, I've made sure
our reunion won't be disturbed by

557
00:34:25,356 --> 00:34:27,692
any pesky late-night phone calls,
commander.

558
00:34:27,775 --> 00:34:29,611
Stop. Why do you keep calling me that?

559
00:34:29,986 --> 00:34:34,574
That was your title, remember?
When we first met, all those years ago.

560
00:34:34,657 --> 00:34:36,492
You wore a uniform in those days.

561
00:34:39,621 --> 00:34:41,205
You.

562
00:34:42,582 --> 00:34:46,127
- It is you.
- The Ghost of Christmas Past.

563
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:48,129
[phone ringing]

564
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:58,056
- Yeah?
[Dascomb] <i>Finch, it's Dascomb.</i>

565
00:34:58,348 --> 00:35:00,934
- Dascomb.
<i>- I've already called the chancellor.</i>

566
00:35:01,017 --> 00:35:04,812
<i>- We have to get control of the situation.</i>
- What situation?

567
00:35:06,356 --> 00:35:10,401
Chancellor Sutler agreed, for obvious
reasons, we have to keep this discreet.

568
00:35:10,485 --> 00:35:13,154
In the wrong light,
the loss of the Voice of London

569
00:35:13,237 --> 00:35:15,323
could be devastating
to our credibility.

570
00:35:16,658 --> 00:35:18,284
Perhaps a stroke?

571
00:35:18,826 --> 00:35:21,245
No, no, it's too horrific.

572
00:35:21,329 --> 00:35:25,124
A quiet, dignified death in his sleep.

573
00:35:26,376 --> 00:35:29,087
- We got any eyes or ears on this?
- No, camcos were cut.

574
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:33,758
It's the same M.O. as before.
But we got an elevator log ID.

575
00:35:33,841 --> 00:35:37,261
- Let me guess.
- She's in deep, inspector.

576
00:35:37,845 --> 00:35:38,845
[metal clanging]

577
00:35:38,888 --> 00:35:40,139
V?

[soaring music playing on TV]

579
00:35:44,143 --> 00:35:45,603
[V chuckles]

580
00:35:46,354 --> 00:35:48,314
My fat, metal friend.

Mondego.

584
00:36:07,917 --> 00:36:11,587
Oh, God. I hope I didn't wake you.

585
00:36:12,088 --> 00:36:15,383
No, I just thought you were fighting.
I mean, for real.

586
00:36:15,591 --> 00:36:16,884
[V] My favorite film:

587
00:36:16,968 --> 00:36:21,556
<i>The Count of Monte Cristo,</i>
with Robert Donat as Edmond Dantes.

588
00:36:21,639 --> 00:36:24,976
<i>It is not my sword, Mondego,
but your past that disarmed you.</i>

It gets me every time.

590
00:36:28,104 --> 00:36:29,897
- Never seen it.
- Really?

591
00:36:30,606 --> 00:36:33,317
- Would you like to?
- Does it have a happy ending?

592
00:36:33,651 --> 00:36:35,737
[V] As only celluloid can deliver.

593
00:36:36,112 --> 00:36:37,613
Okay.

594
00:36:38,406 --> 00:36:39,741
Put the sword away.

595
00:36:40,283 --> 00:36:42,201
Forensics just wrapped.

596
00:36:42,744 --> 00:36:46,080
No prints, no hair, no fibers.
The guy is like a ghost.

597
00:36:46,164 --> 00:36:48,082
You won't believe
what they found on Prothero.

598
00:36:48,166 --> 00:36:50,334
- Drugs?
- Could've started his own hospital.

599
00:36:50,418 --> 00:36:52,045
- Interesting.
- Why?

600
00:36:52,128 --> 00:36:55,631
Did you know Lewis Prothero was
one of the richest men in the country

601
00:36:55,715 --> 00:36:57,550
before he was the Voice of London?

602
00:36:57,633 --> 00:37:00,178
- Drugs?
- Legal ones.

603
00:37:00,261 --> 00:37:03,139
Major stockholder
in Viadoxic Pharmaceutical.

604
00:37:03,222 --> 00:37:07,518
Viadoxic and St. Mary's
in less than a week. Coincidence?

605
00:37:07,602 --> 00:37:11,189
When you're at this as long as I've been,
you stop believing in coincidence.

606
00:37:11,981 --> 00:37:13,691
<i>May we come up?</i>

607
00:37:14,734 --> 00:37:17,403
- [Dantes] <i>You find your own tree.</i>
- [V] You find your own tree.

608
00:37:22,784 --> 00:37:24,911
- Did you like it?
- Yeah.

609
00:37:25,661 --> 00:37:28,915
- But it made me feel sorry for Mercedes.
- Why?

610
00:37:30,041 --> 00:37:32,919
Because he cared more about revenge
than he did about her.

611

<i>...nationwide were devastated

<i>...most awarded stars

She blinks a lot when she does a story
she knows is false.

<i>Lewis, you will be sorely missed.</i>

622
00:38:13,042 --> 00:38:16,295
V, yesterday I couldn't find my ID.

623
00:38:16,379 --> 00:38:18,131
You didn't take it, did you?

624
00:38:18,714 --> 00:38:21,342
[V] Would you prefer a lie or the truth?

625
00:38:23,052 --> 00:38:25,304
Did you have anything
to do with that?

626
00:38:25,388 --> 00:38:28,391
- Yes, I killed him.
- You.

627
00:38:28,474 --> 00:38:30,017
- Oh, God.
- You're upset.

628
00:38:30,226 --> 00:38:32,687
I'm upset?
You just said you killed Lewis Prothero.

629
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:36,232
I might have killed the Fingermen that
attacked you. I heard no objection.

630
00:38:36,315 --> 00:38:38,860
- What?
- Violence can be used for good.

631
00:38:39,235 --> 00:38:41,779
- What are you talking about?
- Justice.

632
00:38:44,574 --> 00:38:48,244
Oh, I see.

633
00:38:48,536 --> 00:38:51,247
[V] There's no court in this country
for men like Prothero.

634
00:38:52,665 --> 00:38:54,750
And are you going to kill more people?

635
00:38:56,085 --> 00:38:57,503
[V] Yes.

636
00:38:58,129 --> 00:39:00,006
Take a look at this.

637
00:39:00,089 --> 00:39:02,592
Prothero's military record.

638
00:39:03,509 --> 00:39:04,927
What do you see?

639
00:39:05,845 --> 00:39:12,059
Iraq, Kurdistan, Syria,
before and after, Sudan.

640
00:39:12,268 --> 00:39:13,895
- Busy boy.
- But after all that

641
00:39:13,978 --> 00:39:17,732
they put him in charge
of a detention facility at Larkhill.

642
00:39:17,815 --> 00:39:20,651
Well, no good deed goes unpunished.

643
00:39:21,903 --> 00:39:24,822
You think there's a connection
between our boy and Larkhill?

644
00:39:24,906 --> 00:39:28,826
It might explain the connection
between him and the Hammond girl.

645
00:39:29,202 --> 00:39:33,372
Problem is, I can't find
any other record of it.

646
00:39:33,456 --> 00:39:38,878
Larkhill? Larkhill? I cannot recall
that particular facility, inspector.

647
00:39:38,961 --> 00:39:42,423
- You're welcome to review our records.
- We've been through your records.

648
00:39:42,506 --> 00:39:46,093
All it says is that there was
a detention facility at Larkhill

649
00:39:46,302 --> 00:39:48,804
approximately 10 miles
north of Salisbury.

650
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:50,097
Well, there you have it.

651
00:39:52,058 --> 00:39:54,602
This is a matter of some urgency, major.

652
00:39:54,685 --> 00:39:57,939
We need to know if there was anything
different about this facility.

653
00:39:58,314 --> 00:40:00,483
I'm sorry, inspector,
I simply cannot recall.

654
00:40:00,566 --> 00:40:03,361
Was there a specific profile
for those being sent there?

655
00:40:03,903 --> 00:40:06,614
- Usual undesirables, I should think.
- But do you know?

656
00:40:06,822 --> 00:40:09,742
- Of course not. I wasn't stationed there.
- Do you know who was?

657
00:40:09,825 --> 00:40:13,120
I cannot recall specific names,
but if you look through our records...

658
00:40:13,204 --> 00:40:17,833
Your records are either deleted,
omitted or missing.

659
00:40:17,917 --> 00:40:19,919
As head of the Detention Program
at that...

660
00:40:20,002 --> 00:40:23,923
Before you go further, let me remind you
things were very chaotic back then.

661
00:40:24,548 --> 00:40:26,842
Now we don't have the problems
we had back then.

662
00:40:26,926 --> 00:40:29,595
We all did what we had to do.

663
00:40:29,679 --> 00:40:33,015
And in those circumstances,
we did the best we could.

664
00:40:33,099 --> 00:40:34,976
That's all I have to say about that.

665
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:43,067
You can do this.

666
00:40:53,202 --> 00:40:54,662
Hi.

667
00:40:55,871 --> 00:40:57,873
I've been thinking.

668
00:40:59,375 --> 00:41:01,168
There's something
I want to ask you

669
00:41:01,252 --> 00:41:05,172
but I don't think you'll understand why
unless you know a few things about me.

670
00:41:07,508 --> 00:41:10,928
My father was a writer.
You would have liked him.

671
00:41:11,887 --> 00:41:14,307
He used to say artists used lies
to tell the truth

672
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:16,892
while politicians used them
to cover the truth up.

673
00:41:17,018 --> 00:41:19,186
[V] A man after my own heart.

674
00:41:19,395 --> 00:41:22,023
He always told the best stories.

675
00:41:23,274 --> 00:41:25,526
Until my brother died.

676
00:41:27,945 --> 00:41:29,822
That was when everything changed.

677
00:41:30,698 --> 00:41:34,201
<i>My brother was one of the students
at St. Mary's.</i>

678
00:41:34,285 --> 00:41:38,164
<i>After he died,
my parents became political.</i>

679
00:41:40,082 --> 00:41:43,711
<i>They protested the war
and the Reclamation.</i>

680
00:41:43,919 --> 00:41:46,213
<i>When Sutler was appointed high chancellor,</i>

681
00:41:46,297 --> 00:41:48,591
<i>they were at the riot in Leeds.</i>

682
00:41:48,674 --> 00:41:50,718
<i>I watched on the television,</i>

683
00:41:50,926 --> 00:41:53,304
<i>thinking I was going
to see my parents killed.</i>

684
00:41:53,929 --> 00:41:56,390
<i>I remember them arguing at night.</i>

685
00:41:56,474 --> 00:41:59,894
<i>Mum wanted to leave the country.
Dad refused.</i>

686
00:41:59,977 --> 00:42:03,105
<i>He said if we ran away,
they would win.</i>

687
00:42:03,189 --> 00:42:05,066
<i>Win, like</i>

688
00:42:05,149 --> 00:42:06,400
<i>it was a game.</i>

689
00:42:06,484 --> 00:42:07,568
[door opens]

690
00:42:09,153 --> 00:42:10,529
Evey, quick, hide!

691
00:42:25,503 --> 00:42:27,463
- Mummy!
- [Evey's mother] Evey!

692
00:42:27,546 --> 00:42:29,006
[Evey]
<i>I never saw them again.</i>

693
00:42:29,548 --> 00:42:33,344
It was like those black bags erased them
from the face of the earth.

694
00:42:33,719 --> 00:42:35,262
I'm sorry, Evey.

695
00:42:35,471 --> 00:42:38,099
No, I'm the one that's sorry.

696
00:42:38,182 --> 00:42:40,559
Sorry I'm not a stronger person.

697
00:42:40,643 --> 00:42:43,687
Sorry I'm not like my parents.
I wish I was...

698
00:42:45,064 --> 00:42:46,565
but I'm not.

699
00:42:47,274 --> 00:42:50,486
I wish I wasn't afraid all the time...

700
00:42:52,196 --> 00:42:53,614
but I am.

701
00:42:53,697 --> 00:42:57,284
I know this world is screwed up.
Believe me, I know it better than most.

702
00:42:57,493 --> 00:43:02,289
Which is why I wanted to ask, if there is
anything I can do to help make it right,

703
00:43:03,541 --> 00:43:05,459
please let me know.

704
00:43:05,543 --> 00:43:07,253
[V] If you wish.

705
00:43:14,885 --> 00:43:17,513
Do you really think
you'll find something here?

706
00:43:17,596 --> 00:43:19,140
Worth a shot.

707
00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:22,143
One thing is true of all governments:

708
00:43:22,226 --> 00:43:26,063
The most reliable records are tax records.

709
00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:35,906
It appears that the original
electronic records have all been lost.

710
00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:39,994
Probably during the Reclamation.
A lot of things went missing back then.

711
00:43:40,077 --> 00:43:44,165
But I found this hard copy
filed in the cold vault.

712
00:43:44,248 --> 00:43:46,584
Everything we've got on Larkhill
is in there.

713
00:43:46,667 --> 00:43:49,170
Thanks. This is a great help.

714
00:43:53,549 --> 00:43:55,634
[Evey speaking in Latin]

715
00:44:00,598 --> 00:44:04,185
[V] "By the power of truth, I, while living,
have conquered the universe."

716
00:44:04,268 --> 00:44:07,480
- Personal motto?
- From <i>Faust.</i>

717
00:44:07,563 --> 00:44:10,065
That's about trying
to cheat the devil, isn't it?

718
00:44:10,191 --> 00:44:12,359
[V] It is. And speaking of the devil,

719
00:44:12,568 --> 00:44:15,362
I was wondering if your offer to help
was still standing.

720
00:44:15,446 --> 00:44:17,865
- Of course.
- It appears that unforeseen circumstances

721
00:44:17,948 --> 00:44:20,826
have accelerated my original plan.

722
00:44:20,910 --> 00:44:24,747
As a result, I'm in need of someone
with some theatrical skill.

723
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:26,123
I'll do my best.

724
00:44:26,624 --> 00:44:28,375
[V] I believe you will.

725
00:44:31,712 --> 00:44:36,884
Another doctor. Why does
a detention facility need so many doctors?

726
00:44:37,092 --> 00:44:38,969
I don't know, but this is interesting.

727
00:44:39,053 --> 00:44:42,598
The highest-paid person
at the camp was a priest.

728
00:44:42,681 --> 00:44:45,893
- Really?
- Yeah, Father Lilliman.

729
00:44:45,976 --> 00:44:49,855
- Lilliman.
- Was paid almost 200 grand a month.

730
00:44:50,689 --> 00:44:52,233
Now, that is interesting.

731
00:44:53,734 --> 00:44:56,820
Looks like he was promoted.
He's a bishop now.

732
00:45:00,241 --> 00:45:02,243
- Your Grace.
- Oh, Denis.

733
00:45:02,326 --> 00:45:04,119
- Has everything been arranged?
- Yes.

734
00:45:04,203 --> 00:45:06,413
I've just received
your InterLink itinerary.

735
00:45:06,497 --> 00:45:09,416
You should arrive in Perth
in time for Mass.

736
00:45:09,625 --> 00:45:11,126
You're most diligent, Denis,

737
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:15,256
a noble example for all those
who labor in the name of our Lord, but...

738
00:45:15,339 --> 00:45:17,925
- Your Grace?
- It wasn't labor I was speaking of.

739
00:45:18,008 --> 00:45:21,136
It was, rather, my final remittance
that I was interested in.

740
00:45:21,804 --> 00:45:23,597
My last little joy.

741
00:45:23,681 --> 00:45:25,474
I'm sorry, Your Grace.

742
00:45:26,684 --> 00:45:30,020
She has arrived, but there was
some confusion at the agency.

743
00:45:30,104 --> 00:45:33,440
They've sent a new girl who,
I'm afraid, is a little older than usual.

744
00:45:33,524 --> 00:45:34,942
Older?

745
00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:37,319
Oh, dear. She's not too old, I trust?

746
00:45:37,444 --> 00:45:39,697
That is for Your Grace to decide.

747
00:45:51,834 --> 00:45:54,461
- Oh, my.
- Your Grace.

748
00:45:56,088 --> 00:46:01,093
To think that I doubted your loveliness
for an instant.

749
00:46:03,012 --> 00:46:05,723
Mea culpa, my child.

750
00:46:05,806 --> 00:46:07,182
Mea culpa.

751
00:46:12,771 --> 00:46:16,191
Your Grace, we don't have much time
and I have to tell you something.

752
00:46:16,275 --> 00:46:20,362
A confession? I love the confession game.

753
00:46:20,863 --> 00:46:22,489
Tell me your sins.

754
00:46:22,573 --> 00:46:24,491
This isn't a game, Your Grace.

755
00:46:24,575 --> 00:46:26,910
Someone's coming.
I think he means to kill you.

756
00:46:27,202 --> 00:46:28,871
- I'm sorry?
- I'm telling you this

757
00:46:28,954 --> 00:46:31,624
because I want some kind
of protection or amnesty.

758
00:46:31,707 --> 00:46:35,461
I had nothing to do with the Bailey
and made a mistake in the Jordan Tower.

759
00:46:35,544 --> 00:46:38,756
- I think this should balance it out.
- What are you talking about?

760
00:46:38,839 --> 00:46:40,758
I'm Evey Hammond. I'm...

761
00:46:40,841 --> 00:46:44,136
I've been the prisoner of the terrorist V
for the past several weeks.

762
00:46:44,219 --> 00:46:47,556
I'm telling you that, any moment,
he's going to come through that door.

763
00:46:47,765 --> 00:46:51,143
I unlocked the window in the room
where Denis told me to get ready.

764
00:46:51,226 --> 00:46:53,604
[laughing] Wonderful!

765
00:46:53,687 --> 00:46:56,023
It's a game I've never played!

766
00:46:56,231 --> 00:46:58,233
What a delightful mind you have.

767
00:46:58,317 --> 00:47:00,235
I hope the rest of you
is just as interesting.

768
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:03,656
- No, please, you have to believe me.
- Oh, I do, I do, I do.

769
00:47:03,739 --> 00:47:05,949
Let me show you
the firmness of my beliefs.

770
00:47:06,033 --> 00:47:07,493
Stop it! Get off of me!

771
00:47:07,785 --> 00:47:09,828
Seems I've captured
a dangerous terrorist.

772
00:47:09,912 --> 00:47:12,039
Now, how best to procure
her confession?

773
00:47:12,623 --> 00:47:13,749
Oh!

774
00:47:14,166 --> 00:47:17,127
You little bitch.
You fucking little whore!

775
00:47:20,047 --> 00:47:21,715
[V] Reverend.
- Oh, my God.

776
00:47:21,799 --> 00:47:23,550
She wasn't lying. It is you.

777
00:47:23,759 --> 00:47:25,761
I'm sorry.

778
00:47:25,844 --> 00:47:27,680
- I had to.
[V] Evey!

779
00:47:32,393 --> 00:47:34,561
And thus I clothe my naked villainy

780
00:47:34,645 --> 00:47:37,773
with old odd ends
stolen forth from holy writ

781
00:47:37,856 --> 00:47:41,068
and seem a saint,
when most I play the devil.

782
00:47:41,151 --> 00:47:43,153
Oh, please, have mercy.

783
00:47:43,362 --> 00:47:45,280
Oh, not tonight, Bishop.

784
00:47:45,406 --> 00:47:47,116
<i>Not tonight.</i>

785
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:51,745
[Lilliman over speaker]
<i>Don't do this, I beg of you.</i>

786
00:47:51,829 --> 00:47:53,622
Well, then.
Children's hour at the abbey.

787
00:47:53,706 --> 00:47:55,791
[V] <i>Open your mouth
and stick out your tongue.</i>

788
00:47:55,874 --> 00:47:59,294
- What the...?
- [Lilliman]<i>I don't want to die!</i>

789
00:48:00,087 --> 00:48:02,631
This is Surveillance 109.
We have an emergency.

790
00:48:04,174 --> 00:48:05,259
[camera shutter clicks]

791
00:48:05,342 --> 00:48:09,179
Run every name in that file.
I want the whereabouts of all of them.

792
00:48:09,263 --> 00:48:10,973
- Tonight.
- Yes, sir.

793
00:48:11,348 --> 00:48:13,726
Pucker up, here comes the Finger.

794
00:48:14,476 --> 00:48:17,187
Yeah. Get going. I'll handle him.

795
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:23,318
Creedy.

796
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:24,862
What are you doing here?

797
00:48:25,821 --> 00:48:29,950
Several prominent party members
have been murdered, chief inspector.

798
00:48:30,033 --> 00:48:34,329
This is no ordinary situation and requires
more than your ordinary attention.

799
00:48:34,413 --> 00:48:37,332
The chancellor demanded
my immediate involvement.

800
00:48:37,416 --> 00:48:40,502
It'll be hard to investigate
if you're detaining all my witnesses.

801
00:48:40,586 --> 00:48:43,839
The security of information is paramount.

802
00:48:44,381 --> 00:48:45,883
In these volatile times,

803
00:48:45,966 --> 00:48:48,886
mistakes like Jordan Tower
can no longer be tolerated,

804
00:48:48,969 --> 00:48:51,430
if, indeed,
Jordan Tower was an accident.

805
00:48:51,513 --> 00:48:53,849
- What does that mean?
- Terrorist seems to have

806
00:48:53,932 --> 00:48:56,643
a rather intimate understanding
of our system.

807
00:48:56,727 --> 00:48:59,563
The chancellor suspects
there might be an informer.

808
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:02,316
Are you saying I'm under surveillance,
Mr. Creedy?

809
00:49:02,399 --> 00:49:04,234
At this time, it would behoove you

810
00:49:04,318 --> 00:49:09,406
to cease any investigation of matters
that have long since passed

811
00:49:09,490 --> 00:49:12,951
and concentrate on the concerns
of our present.

812
00:49:13,619 --> 00:49:14,953
You mean Larkhill?

813
00:49:15,037 --> 00:49:18,665
Major Wilson is a friend
of the high chancellor.

814
00:49:18,874 --> 00:49:22,085
- His loyalty is not in question.
- But mine is?

815
00:49:23,295 --> 00:49:26,173
Your mother was Irish, wasn't she?

816
00:49:26,882 --> 00:49:30,010
Terrible what St. Mary's
did to Ireland, wasn't it?

817
00:49:31,637 --> 00:49:33,931
I've been a party member for 27 years.

818
00:49:34,014 --> 00:49:36,391
If I were you, chief inspector,

819
00:49:36,475 --> 00:49:38,685
I'd find the terrorist

820
00:49:38,894 --> 00:49:40,771
and I'd find him soon.

821
00:49:41,355 --> 00:49:42,815
[doorbell rings]

822
00:49:42,898 --> 00:49:44,024
[siren wailing nearby]

823
00:49:44,107 --> 00:49:45,692
Please.

824
00:49:49,905 --> 00:49:52,032
Evey? Good God!

825
00:49:52,115 --> 00:49:54,701
I'm sorry.
I didn't know where else to go.

826
00:49:56,662 --> 00:49:59,665
Yes, well, you better come inside
before someone sees you.

827
00:50:08,173 --> 00:50:11,051
- Cheers.
- I know every cop's looking for me.

828
00:50:11,134 --> 00:50:13,679
I know it's horrible of me
to put you in this situation.

829
00:50:13,762 --> 00:50:16,223
- Evey...
- You could be in terrible trouble.

830
00:50:16,306 --> 00:50:17,933
Evey, listen to me.

831
00:50:18,016 --> 00:50:21,937
If the government searched my house,
you would be the least of my problems.

832
00:50:26,108 --> 00:50:27,734
You trusted me.

833
00:50:27,943 --> 00:50:30,988
It would be terrible manners
for me not to trust you.

834
00:50:44,251 --> 00:50:46,753
Oh, my God.
That's <i>God Save the Queen.</i>

835
00:50:46,837 --> 00:50:49,631
My parents took me to it
when they hung it at Gallery 12.

836
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:53,927
- I thought Sutler had it destroyed.
- He believes he did.

837
00:50:54,011 --> 00:50:56,889
Cost me more than this house,
but no matter how bad I feel,

838
00:50:57,097 --> 00:50:58,849
it always cheers me up.

839
00:51:00,976 --> 00:51:05,063
- What is that?
- It's a copy of the Koran, 14th century.

840
00:51:05,147 --> 00:51:07,357
- Are you a Muslim?
- No, I'm in television.

841
00:51:08,150 --> 00:51:09,610
But why would you keep it?

842
00:51:09,693 --> 00:51:13,030
I don't have to be Muslim to find
the images beautiful or poetry moving.

843
00:51:13,113 --> 00:51:15,157
Is it worth it? If they found that here...

844
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:17,576
I told you,
you'd be the least of my worries.

845
00:51:18,201 --> 00:51:20,203
Thank you, Gordon.

846
00:51:20,287 --> 00:51:22,497
- Thank you so much.
- It's all right.

847
00:51:22,623 --> 00:51:26,168
This whole thing started the night
he blew up the Old Bailey.

848
00:51:26,251 --> 00:51:28,503
I was on my way here, and...

849
00:51:28,587 --> 00:51:30,172
Ah.

850
00:51:30,255 --> 00:51:31,757
Yes.

851
00:51:35,010 --> 00:51:37,512
You see, we are both fugitives
in our own way.

852
00:51:38,347 --> 00:51:39,806
- But...
- You're wondering why

853
00:51:40,015 --> 00:51:42,559
you were invited here to supper
in the first place

854
00:51:42,643 --> 00:51:46,813
if my appetites were
for less conventional fare.

855
00:51:46,897 --> 00:51:50,525
Unfortunately, a man in my position
is expected to entertain

856
00:51:50,609 --> 00:51:53,278
young and attractive ladies
like yourself.

857
00:51:53,528 --> 00:51:57,282
Because in this world,
if I were to invite who I desired,

858
00:51:57,366 --> 00:52:01,411
I would undoubtedly find myself
without a home, let alone a TV show.

859
00:52:01,495 --> 00:52:04,539
- I'm sorry.
- Not as sorry as I am.

860
00:52:05,832 --> 00:52:07,751
The truth is, after so many years,

861
00:52:07,834 --> 00:52:11,338
you begin to lose
more than just your appetite.

862
00:52:11,546 --> 00:52:15,509
You wear a mask for so long,
you forget who you were beneath it.

863
00:52:15,676 --> 00:52:21,348
I'm sorry, chief inspector.
Same basic toxicology as Prothero.

864
00:52:21,556 --> 00:52:24,559
You could get these poisons
from any house in London.

865
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:27,270
Thanks, Delia.

866
00:52:28,063 --> 00:52:31,483
[Delia]
Any leads on finding this guy?

867
00:52:31,566 --> 00:52:34,945
Nothing yet. But there's something else
you can help me with.

868
00:52:37,698 --> 00:52:40,742
You started as a botanist, didn't you?

869
00:52:42,202 --> 00:52:44,621
It's... It's a Scarlet Carson.

870
00:52:46,123 --> 00:52:48,458
They're believed to be extinct.

871
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:51,586
He leaves them at the crime scenes.

872
00:52:52,212 --> 00:52:54,423
I'd appreciate it
if you could have a look at it.

873
00:52:54,631 --> 00:52:57,175
Any information could be helpful.

874
00:52:57,968 --> 00:53:00,804
- Of course.
- [phone ringing]

875
00:53:00,887 --> 00:53:02,305
Excuse me.

876
00:53:03,098 --> 00:53:04,307
Yeah?

877
00:53:04,391 --> 00:53:07,352
[Dominic] <i>I just finished
going through the file, inspector.</i>

878
00:53:07,436 --> 00:53:08,770
<i>You better get back here.</i>

879
00:53:08,854 --> 00:53:10,355
[Finch] Yeah, okay.

880
00:53:12,107 --> 00:53:15,235
- My God. He's killed them all.
- [Dominic] All but one.

881
00:53:16,361 --> 00:53:18,905
- [Finch] Who is she?
- [Dominic] Not sure.

882
00:53:18,989 --> 00:53:21,616
She's clearly one of the people
in charge at Larkhill.

883
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:25,287
But after they shut it down,
she disappeared for two years.

884
00:53:25,370 --> 00:53:28,040
Till she applied for an overseas visa,
which was denied.

885
00:53:28,623 --> 00:53:30,125
Running away?

886
00:53:30,208 --> 00:53:34,421
Probably, because after that,
all record of her seems to stop.

887
00:53:34,629 --> 00:53:37,007
- She changed her name.
- That's what I'm guessing.

888
00:53:37,090 --> 00:53:40,260
I put a call in to the registry,
but I haven't heard back.

889
00:53:40,343 --> 00:53:43,722
- It's late, or early.
- Call them again. I want that name.

890
00:53:56,151 --> 00:53:57,486
What? Are you sure about that?

891
00:53:57,986 --> 00:53:59,404
Okay. Thank you.

892
00:54:00,363 --> 00:54:03,784
Dr. Diana Stanton changed her name
to Delia Surridge.

893
00:54:04,159 --> 00:54:06,203
- The coroner?
- Yeah.

894
00:54:06,995 --> 00:54:08,455
Jesus, I just saw her.

895
00:54:11,458 --> 00:54:12,751
[wind whistling]

896
00:54:17,506 --> 00:54:19,341
It's you, isn't it?

897
00:54:20,008 --> 00:54:23,095
- You've come to kill me.
- [V] Yes.

898
00:54:24,554 --> 00:54:26,473
Thank God.

899
00:54:27,057 --> 00:54:28,475
[siren wailing]

900
00:54:28,558 --> 00:54:31,228
[operator] <i>I'm sorry, but I can't get
a response from that number.</i>

901
00:54:31,311 --> 00:54:33,230
<i>There's a problem with the connection.</i>

902
00:54:33,313 --> 00:54:35,190
Jesus Christ.

903
00:54:35,690 --> 00:54:37,192
He's there.

904
00:54:38,193 --> 00:54:41,613
[Delia] After what happened,
after what they did,

905
00:54:42,030 --> 00:54:44,116
I thought about killing myself.

906
00:54:46,409 --> 00:54:49,496
But I knew that one day
you'd come for me.

907
00:54:50,789 --> 00:54:52,999
I didn't know what
they were going to do.

908
00:54:53,792 --> 00:54:55,377
I swear to you.

909
00:54:55,710 --> 00:54:57,212
Read my journal.

910
00:54:57,295 --> 00:55:00,590
What they did was only possible
because of you.

911
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:06,096
Oppenheimer was able to change
more than the course of a war.

912
00:55:06,179 --> 00:55:09,057
He changed the entire course
of human history.

913
00:55:10,308 --> 00:55:12,894
Is it wrong to hold on
to that kind of hope?

914
00:55:13,103 --> 00:55:16,273
I have not come
for what you hoped to do.

915
00:55:16,356 --> 00:55:18,275
I've come for what you did.

916
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:21,111
It's funny.

917
00:55:21,194 --> 00:55:24,072
I was given one of your roses today.

918
00:55:25,323 --> 00:55:28,535
I wasn't sure you were the terrorist
until I saw it.

919
00:55:30,745 --> 00:55:34,374
What a strange coincidence,
that I should be given one today.

920
00:55:35,458 --> 00:55:38,044
There are no coincidences, Delia.

921
00:55:38,253 --> 00:55:41,256
Only the illusion of coincidence.

922
00:55:41,339 --> 00:55:43,383
I have another rose.

923
00:55:44,551 --> 00:55:46,887
And this one is for you.

924
00:55:52,475 --> 00:55:56,396
- You're going to kill me now?
- I killed you 10 minutes ago

925
00:55:57,189 --> 00:55:58,982
while you slept.

926
00:56:00,025 --> 00:56:02,777
- Is there any pain?
- No.

927
00:56:02,986 --> 00:56:04,362
Thank you.

928
00:56:06,781 --> 00:56:09,910
Is it meaningless to apologize?

929
00:56:10,327 --> 00:56:11,411
[V] Never.

930
00:56:12,621 --> 00:56:14,581
I'm so sorry.

931
00:56:24,841 --> 00:56:27,636
[siren wailing]

932
00:56:36,228 --> 00:56:37,938
Damn it.

933
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:43,318
[Finch] The terrorist obviously
wanted us to have it.

934
00:56:43,401 --> 00:56:47,072
He wanted us to know the story,
or at least a part of it.

935
00:56:47,155 --> 00:56:50,242
<i>Am I to understand that you have read
this document, inspector?</i>

936
00:56:50,450 --> 00:56:52,535
- Yes, sir.
<i>- Has anyone else read it?</i>

937
00:56:52,619 --> 00:56:55,538
- No, sir.
<i>- Then let me make this perfectly clear.</i>

938
00:56:55,747 --> 00:56:59,251
<i>The contents of this document
are a matter of national security</i>

939
00:56:59,334 --> 00:57:03,255
<i>constituting an assault on the character
of several important party members</i>

940
00:57:03,630 --> 00:57:06,925
<i>as well as a blatant violation
of the Articles of Allegiance.</i>

941
00:57:07,008 --> 00:57:10,011
<i>As the authenticity of this document
cannot be verified,</i>

942
00:57:10,095 --> 00:57:14,015
<i>it could be an elaborate forgery
created by the terrorist</i>

943
00:57:14,099 --> 00:57:17,852
<i>as easily as it could be the deranged
fantasy of a former party member</i>

944
00:57:17,936 --> 00:57:20,146
<i>who resigned for psychological reasons.</i>

945
00:57:20,647 --> 00:57:23,275
<i>Any discussion of this document
or its contents</i>

946
00:57:23,358 --> 00:57:26,361
<i>will be regarded, at the very least,
as an act of sedition</i>

947
00:57:26,444 --> 00:57:29,030
<i>if not a willful act of treason.</i>

948
00:57:29,114 --> 00:57:32,534
<i>- Is that understood, Mr. Finch?</i>
- Yes, sir.

949
00:57:32,617 --> 00:57:35,370
<i>You would do well, inspector,</i>

950
00:57:35,453 --> 00:57:37,914
<i>to put it out of your mind.</i>

951

- Really?
- I swear.

1000
01:01:01,159 --> 01:01:06,039
That is a strange coincidence.
Although there's an obvious explanation.

1001
01:01:06,122 --> 01:01:08,082
- There is?
- Yes, Evey.

1002

1003

At last you know the truth.

1004

You're stunned, I know.

1005
01:01:13,713 --> 01:01:17,509
Hard to believe, isn't it, that beneath
this wrinkled, well-fed exterior,

1006
01:01:17,592 --> 01:01:22,805
there lies a dangerous killing machine
with a fetish for Fawkesian masks.

Yeah, I know.
I'm useless without a studio audience.

1010

for less than that.

Of course, he was right, wasn't he?

1012

There is something wrong
with this country.

1013

I don't care if you answer me or not.

1019
01:02:19,070 --> 01:02:21,281
I just wanna say this aloud.

1020
01:02:22,532 --> 01:02:26,369
But I need to know that this question
will not leave this office.

1021
01:02:26,452 --> 01:02:28,788
Yeah, of course, inspector, but...

1022
01:02:29,872 --> 01:02:31,291
Because of the terrorist?

1023
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:34,085
No.

1024
01:02:35,253 --> 01:02:38,339
So, what is it, chief? What's going on?

1025
01:02:41,175 --> 01:02:44,679
The question I want to ask
is about St. Mary's

1026
01:02:45,555 --> 01:02:46,931
and Three Waters.

1027
01:02:49,100 --> 01:02:53,479
The question that's kept me up
for the last 24 hours,

1028
01:02:53,688 --> 01:02:56,482
the question I have to ask, is:

1029
01:02:57,984 --> 01:03:00,862
What if the worst,

1030
01:03:01,571 --> 01:03:05,199
the most horrifying biological attack
in this country's history

1031
01:03:05,283 --> 01:03:09,120
was not the work of religious extremists?

1032
01:03:09,203 --> 01:03:12,957
I don't understand. We know it was.
They were caught. They confessed.

1033
01:03:13,041 --> 01:03:15,251
And they were executed. I know.

1034
01:03:15,335 --> 01:03:18,379
And maybe that's really what happened.

1035
01:03:20,715 --> 01:03:23,343
But I see this chain of events...

1036
01:03:24,719 --> 01:03:28,306
these coincidences, and I have to ask:

1037
01:03:28,389 --> 01:03:30,016
What if that isn't what happened?

1038
01:03:30,224 --> 01:03:33,186
What if someone else unleashed that virus?

1039
01:03:33,269 --> 01:03:37,398
What if someone else
killed all those people?

1040
01:03:37,482 --> 01:03:39,859
Would you really wanna know who it was?

1041
01:03:40,860 --> 01:03:42,320
Sure.

1042
01:03:42,403 --> 01:03:44,781
Even if it was someone
working for this government?

1043
01:03:46,741 --> 01:03:48,284
That's my question.

1044
01:03:48,743 --> 01:03:51,537
If our own government was responsible

1045
01:03:51,746 --> 01:03:56,000
for what happened at St. Mary's
and Three Waters...

1046
01:03:57,960 --> 01:04:00,296

1047
01:04:00,380 --> 01:04:04,550

01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:41,335
<i>They were beautiful.</i>

1166
01:13:43,921 --> 01:13:46,215
<i>I thought we would
love each other forever.</i>

1167
01:13:46,924 --> 01:13:49,134
<i>I remember our teacher telling us</i>

1168
01:13:49,218 --> 01:13:52,012
<i>that it was an adolescent phase
that people outgrew.</i>

1169
01:13:52,096 --> 01:13:53,681
<i>Sarah did.</i>

1170
01:13:55,224 --> 01:13:57,059
<i>I didn't.</i>

1171
01:13:57,268 --> 01:14:01,438
<i>In 2002, I fell in love
with a girl named Christina.</i>

1172
01:14:01,522 --> 01:14:03,107
<i>That year I came out to my parents.</i>

1173
01:14:03,190 --> 01:14:04,566
[shouting indistinctly]

1174
01:14:04,650 --> 01:14:07,653
[Valerie] <i>I couldn't have done it
without Chris holding my hand.</i>

1175
01:14:07,736 --> 01:14:11,657
<i>My father wouldn't look at me.
He told me to go and never come back.</i>

1176
01:14:11,740 --> 01:14:12,992
[woman crying]

1177
01:14:13,075 --> 01:14:14,868
[Valerie] <i>My mother said nothing.</i>

1178
01:14:15,703 --> 01:14:19,665
<i>But I'd only told them the truth.
Was that so selfish?</i>

1179
01:14:20,291 --> 01:14:24,670
<i>Our integrity sells for so little,
but it is all we really have.</i>

1180
01:14:24,753 --> 01:14:27,006
<i>It is the very last inch of us.</i>

1181
01:14:27,881 --> 01:14:29,758
<i>But within that inch,</i>

1182
01:14:29,842 --> 01:14:31,135
<i>we are free.</i>

1183
01:14:33,887 --> 01:14:35,514
[man]
It ends whenever you want it to.

1184
01:14:35,597 --> 01:14:38,225
- Just tell us where he is.
- I don't know.

1185
01:15:14,803 --> 01:15:17,348
[Valerie] <i>I'd always known
what I wanted to do with my life</i>

1186
01:15:17,431 --> 01:15:22,686
<i>and in 2015, I starred in my first film,</i>
The Salt Flats.

1187
01:15:24,021 --> 01:15:27,691
<i>It was the most important role of my life.
Not because of my career,</i>

1188
01:15:27,775 --> 01:15:29,818
<i>but because that was how I met Ruth.</i>

1189
01:15:32,112 --> 01:15:33,822
<i>The first time we kissed,</i>

1190
01:15:34,448 --> 01:15:38,702
<i>I knew I never wanted to kiss
any other lips but hers again.</i>

1191
01:15:45,125 --> 01:15:48,003
<i>We moved to a small flat
in London together.</i>

1192
01:15:48,087 --> 01:15:50,672
<i>She grew Scarlet Carsons for me
in our window box</i>

1193
01:15:51,673 --> 01:15:54,468
<i>and our place always smelt of roses.</i>

1194
01:15:56,303 --> 01:15:58,972
<i>Those were the best years of my life.</i>

1195
01:16:02,601 --> 01:16:05,104
<i>But America's war grew worse and worse</i>

1196
01:16:05,187 --> 01:16:07,189
<i>and eventually came to London.</i>

1197
01:16:07,272 --> 01:16:10,401
The bill proposed by the Undersecretary
for Defense, Adam Sutler

1198
01:16:10,484 --> 01:16:13,487
to close the remaining tube stations
passed with near-universal...

1199
01:16:13,570 --> 01:16:16,490
[Valerie]
<i>After that, there were no roses anymore.</i>

1200
01:16:17,074 --> 01:16:18,409
<i>Not for anyone.</i>

1201
01:16:18,492 --> 01:16:20,661
[man] You won't last much longer.

1202
01:16:20,744 --> 01:16:22,496
You're gonna die here.

1203
01:16:22,579 --> 01:16:25,707
Why protect someone
who doesn't give a shit about you?

1204
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,086
[door slams, locks]

1205
01:16:36,552 --> 01:16:39,930
[Valerie] <i>I remember how the meaning
of words began to change.</i>

1206
01:16:41,140 --> 01:16:46,687
<i>How unfamiliar words like "collateral"
and "rendition" became frightening,</i>

1207
01:16:47,271 --> 01:16:52,109
<i>while things like "Norsefire" and the
"Articles of Allegiance" became powerful.</i>

1208
01:16:52,526 --> 01:16:56,029
<i>I remember how "different"
became dangerous.</i>

1209
01:16:56,113 --> 01:16:58,699
<i>I still don't understand it,</i>

1210
01:16:58,782 --> 01:17:00,909
<i>why they hate us so much.</i>

1211
01:17:02,369 --> 01:17:03,871
[grunts]

1212
01:17:06,748 --> 01:17:09,334
[Valerie] <i>They took Ruth
while she was out buying food.</i>

1213
01:17:12,045 --> 01:17:14,673
<i>I've never cried so hard in my life.</i>

1214
01:17:16,216 --> 01:17:18,427
<i>It wasn't long till they came for me.</i>

1215
01:17:26,226 --> 01:17:30,314
<i>It seems strange that my life should end
in such a terrible place.</i>

1216
01:17:30,397 --> 01:17:35,861
<i>But for three years,
I had roses and apologized to no one.</i>

1217
01:17:38,697 --> 01:17:40,324
<i>I shall die here.</i>

1218
01:17:40,407 --> 01:17:44,036
<i>Every inch of me shall perish.</i>

1219
01:17:44,119 --> 01:17:45,871
<i>Every inch</i>

1220
01:17:46,455 --> 01:17:47,706
<i>but one.</i>

1221
01:17:51,877 --> 01:17:53,587
<i>An inch.</i>

1222
01:17:54,296 --> 01:17:56,882
<i>It is small, and it is fragile</i>

1223
01:17:57,090 --> 01:18:00,761
<i>and it is the only thing
in the world worth having.</i>

1224
01:18:00,886 --> 01:18:06,016
<i>We must never lose it or give it away.
We must never let them take it from us.</i>

1225
01:18:06,767 --> 01:18:11,188
<i>I hope that, whoever you are,
you escape this place.</i>

1226
01:18:11,271 --> 01:18:14,525
<i>I hope that the world turns
and that things get better.</i>

1227
01:18:16,026 --> 01:18:19,655
<i>But what I hope most of all
is that you understand what I mean</i>

1228
01:18:19,738 --> 01:18:23,033
<i>when I tell you that
even though I do not know you</i>

1229
01:18:23,116 --> 01:18:25,911
<i>and even though
I may never meet you,</i>

1230
01:18:26,119 --> 01:18:29,373
<i>laugh with you, cry with you,</i>

1231
01:18:29,456 --> 01:18:31,416
<i>or kiss you...</i>

1232
01:18:31,875 --> 01:18:33,752
<i>I love you.</i>

1233
01:18:33,835 --> 01:18:36,421
<i>With all my heart,</i>

1234
01:18:36,672 --> 01:18:38,632
<i>I love you.</i>

1235
01:18:40,259 --> 01:18:41,677
<i>Valerie.</i>

1236
01:18:54,398 --> 01:18:56,066
[man] I'm instructed to inform you

1237
01:18:56,149 --> 01:18:59,152
that you have been convicted
by special tribunal

1238
01:18:59,236 --> 01:19:02,281
and that unless you are ready
to offer your cooperation,

1239
01:19:02,364 --> 01:19:04,324
you are to be executed.

1240
01:19:04,408 --> 01:19:08,203
Do you understand what I'm telling you?

1241
01:19:09,246 --> 01:19:12,040
- Yes.
- Are you ready to cooperate?

1242
01:19:15,210 --> 01:19:18,171
- No.
- Very well.

1243
01:19:20,173 --> 01:19:22,968
Escort Miss Hammond back to her cell.

1244
01:19:24,094 --> 01:19:25,637
Arrange a detail of six men

1245
01:19:25,721 --> 01:19:28,724
and take her out behind
the chemical shed and shoot her.

1246
01:19:44,698 --> 01:19:45,991
[man] It's time.

1247
01:19:47,701 --> 01:19:49,077
I'm ready.

1248
01:19:50,787 --> 01:19:53,624
[man] Look, all they want
is one little piece of information.

1249
01:19:53,707 --> 01:19:55,959
Just give them something, anything.

1250
01:19:56,877 --> 01:19:58,378
Thank you,

1251
01:19:58,462 --> 01:20:01,506
but I'd rather die
behind the chemical sheds.

1252
01:20:01,715 --> 01:20:06,053
[man] Then you have no fear anymore.
You're completely free.

1253
01:20:12,059 --> 01:20:13,310
What?

1254
01:21:37,561 --> 01:21:39,062
Hello, Evey.

1255
01:21:40,605 --> 01:21:41,898
You.

1256
01:21:44,067 --> 01:21:46,903
- It was you?
- Yeah.

1257
01:21:47,320 --> 01:21:48,989
That wasn't real?

1258
01:21:51,450 --> 01:21:55,495
- Is Gordon...?
- I'm sorry, but Mr. Deitrich's dead.

1259
01:21:55,620 --> 01:21:57,080
I thought they'd arrest him

1260
01:21:57,164 --> 01:22:00,459
but when they found a Koran
in his house, they had him executed.

1261
01:22:01,126 --> 01:22:02,627
Oh, God.

1262
01:22:03,336 --> 01:22:06,882
- Fortunately, I got to you before they did.
- You got to me?

1263
01:22:08,633 --> 01:22:10,469
You did this to me?

1264
01:22:12,053 --> 01:22:13,472
You cut my hair?

1265
01:22:15,140 --> 01:22:16,433
You tortured me?

1266
01:22:17,267 --> 01:22:19,102
You tortured me.

1267
01:22:20,645 --> 01:22:21,855
Why?

1268
01:22:23,023 --> 01:22:27,527
[V] You said you wanted to live without
fear. I wish there'd been an easier way

1269
01:22:27,611 --> 01:22:29,738
- but there wasn't.
- Oh, my God.

1270
01:22:29,821 --> 01:22:31,782
I know you may never forgive me

1271
01:22:32,365 --> 01:22:35,035
but nor will you understand
how hard it was for me.

1272
01:22:35,118 --> 01:22:38,246
Every day, I saw in myself
everything you see in me now.

1273
01:22:38,663 --> 01:22:40,874
Every day, I wanted to end it.

1274
01:22:40,957 --> 01:22:44,628
But each time you refused to give in,
I knew I couldn't.

1275
01:22:44,711 --> 01:22:47,506
You're sick! You're evil!

1276
01:22:48,131 --> 01:22:51,134
You could have ended it.
You could have given in, but you didn't.

1277
01:22:51,885 --> 01:22:54,262
- Why?
- Leave me alone! I hate you!

1278
01:22:54,471 --> 01:22:58,058
[V] That's it! See, at first,
I thought it was hate too.

1279
01:22:58,141 --> 01:23:00,769
Hate was all I knew.
It built my world, imprisoned me,

1280
01:23:00,852 --> 01:23:03,438
taught me how to eat,
how to drink, how to breathe.

1281
01:23:03,522 --> 01:23:07,192
I thought I'd die
with all the hate in my veins.

1282
01:23:07,275 --> 01:23:09,277
But then something happened.

1283
01:23:09,361 --> 01:23:11,863
It happened to me
just as it happened to you.

1284
01:23:11,947 --> 01:23:14,908
Shut up! I don't want to hear
your lies!

1285
01:23:14,991 --> 01:23:18,829
[V] Your own father said
that artists use lies to tell the truth.

1286
01:23:18,912 --> 01:23:20,705
Yes, I created a lie.

1287
01:23:20,914 --> 01:23:24,668
But because you believed it,
you found something true about yourself.

1288
01:23:24,751 --> 01:23:28,088
- No.
- What was true in that cell is true now.

1289
01:23:28,171 --> 01:23:31,341
What you felt in there
has nothing to do with me.

1290
01:23:31,424 --> 01:23:34,094
I can't feel anything anymore!

1291
01:23:34,177 --> 01:23:37,430
Don't run from it, Evey.
You've been running all your life.

1292
01:23:37,514 --> 01:23:39,015
[gasping]

1293
01:23:39,099 --> 01:23:40,934
I can't. Can't breathe.

1294
01:23:41,476 --> 01:23:45,814
Asthma. When I was little...

1295
01:23:47,941 --> 01:23:49,484
Listen to me, Evey.

1296
01:23:50,151 --> 01:23:53,321
This may be the most important moment
of your life. Commit to it.

1297
01:23:53,405 --> 01:23:55,198
[sobbing]

1298
01:23:55,282 --> 01:23:59,744
They took your parents from you.
They took your brother from you.

1299
01:23:59,828 --> 01:24:02,706
They put you in a cell
and took everything they could take,

1300
01:24:02,789 --> 01:24:04,958
except your life.

1301
01:24:05,041 --> 01:24:08,003
And you believed that was all
there was, didn't you?

1302
01:24:08,086 --> 01:24:10,922
The only thing you had left
was your life, but it wasn't.

1303
01:24:11,006 --> 01:24:14,759
- Oh, please.
- You found something else.

1304
01:24:14,843 --> 01:24:18,763
In that cell, you found something
that mattered more to you than life.

1305
01:24:18,847 --> 01:24:22,225
When they threatened to kill you
unless you gave them what they wanted,

1306
01:24:23,143 --> 01:24:25,270
you told them you'd rather die.

1307
01:24:25,812 --> 01:24:27,355
You faced your death, Evey.

1308
01:24:27,772 --> 01:24:30,525
You were calm. You were still.

1309
01:24:30,609 --> 01:24:33,069
Try to feel now what you felt then.

1310
01:24:39,242 --> 01:24:41,202
Oh, God.

1311
01:24:43,705 --> 01:24:45,040
I felt.

1312
01:24:45,707 --> 01:24:47,125
[V] Yes?

1313
01:24:49,085 --> 01:24:50,962
I'm dizzy.

1314
01:24:51,046 --> 01:24:53,214
I need air.

1315
01:24:53,298 --> 01:24:56,635
Please, I need to be outside.

1316
01:24:56,718 --> 01:24:58,803
[V] There's a lift.
It'll take us to the roof.

1317
01:24:58,970 --> 01:25:01,973
[thunder rumbling]

1318
01:25:17,405 --> 01:25:18,865
God is in the rain.

[Cat Power's "I Found a Reason" playing]

1322
01:26:23,638 --> 01:26:25,098
V.

1323
01:26:26,099 --> 01:26:27,600
I'm leaving.

1324
01:26:30,020 --> 01:26:33,606
There are 872 songs in here.

1325
01:26:34,482 --> 01:26:37,694
I've listened to them all,
but I've never danced to any of them.

1326
01:26:37,777 --> 01:26:40,989
- Did you hear me?
- Yes.

1327
01:26:41,072 --> 01:26:42,615
I can't stay here.

1328
01:26:44,117 --> 01:26:45,660
[V] I know.

1329
01:26:46,911 --> 01:26:50,373
Well, you won't find
any more locked doors here.

1330
01:26:51,332 --> 01:26:53,543
I thought about keeping this

1331
01:26:53,626 --> 01:26:57,172
but it didn't seem right,
knowing you wrote it.

1332
01:27:03,178 --> 01:27:04,637
I didn't.

1333
01:27:06,765 --> 01:27:08,850
May I show you something before you go?

1334
01:27:19,652 --> 01:27:22,238
- She was real.
- Yes.

1335
01:27:22,322 --> 01:27:24,157
She's beautiful.

1336
01:27:25,241 --> 01:27:27,410
- Did you know her?
- No.

1337
01:27:27,786 --> 01:27:30,288
She wrote the letter
just before she died.

1338
01:27:30,371 --> 01:27:33,291
And I delivered it to you
as it had been delivered to me.

1339
01:27:33,666 --> 01:27:35,376
Then it really happened, didn't it?

1340
01:27:36,086 --> 01:27:38,671
- Yes.
- You were in the cell next to her.

1341
01:27:41,257 --> 01:27:43,843
And that's what this is all about.

1342
01:27:43,927 --> 01:27:47,097
You're getting back at them
for what they did to her.

1343
01:27:47,722 --> 01:27:50,975
- And to you.
- What was done to me created me.

1344
01:27:51,059 --> 01:27:53,061
It's a basic principle of the universe

1345
01:27:53,144 --> 01:27:56,189
that every action will create
an equal and opposing reaction.

1346
01:27:56,272 --> 01:27:57,732
Is that how you see it?

1347
01:27:57,816 --> 01:28:00,360
- Like an equation?
- What was done to me was monstrous.

1348
01:28:00,485 --> 01:28:02,612
And they created a monster.

1349
01:28:13,206 --> 01:28:16,251
- Do you know where you'll go?
- No.

1350
01:28:17,293 --> 01:28:18,920
That would have scared me before

1351
01:28:19,003 --> 01:28:21,881
but I suppose I should thank you.

1352
01:28:22,215 --> 01:28:23,800
Well.

1353
01:28:33,351 --> 01:28:35,019
Thank you.

1354
01:28:37,522 --> 01:28:39,149
Goodbye.

1355
01:28:41,317 --> 01:28:43,027
Evey...

1356
01:28:44,028 --> 01:28:47,031
may I ask you for something?

1357
01:28:47,115 --> 01:28:51,953
If I had one wish, I would wish
to see you again, if only once

1358
01:28:52,162 --> 01:28:53,872
before the 5th.

1359
01:28:56,291 --> 01:28:58,751
- All right.
- Thank you.

1360
01:29:13,808 --> 01:29:16,311
[sobbing]

1361
01:29:20,982 --> 01:29:23,776
[Heyer] Chancellor, I know no one
seems to want to discuss this

1362
01:29:23,860 --> 01:29:26,362
but if we're to be prepared
for any eventuality,

1363
01:29:26,446 --> 01:29:29,449
then it can't be ignored any longer.

1364
01:29:29,532 --> 01:29:34,078
The red report in front of you has been
vetted by several demolition specialists.

1365
01:29:34,162 --> 01:29:35,747
Now, it concludes that

1366
01:29:35,830 --> 01:29:38,750
the most logical delivery system
for the terrorist to use

1367
01:29:39,375 --> 01:29:41,878
would be an airborne attack.

1368
01:29:41,961 --> 01:29:43,671
A separate report has been filed

1369
01:29:43,755 --> 01:29:47,675
suggesting a train, despite the fact
that the tunnels surrounding Parliament

1370
01:29:47,759 --> 01:29:49,427
have been sealed shut.

1371
01:29:49,510 --> 01:29:51,512
<i>Who filed that report?</i>

1372
01:29:52,680 --> 01:29:54,307
[Heyer] Chief Inspector Finch.

1373
01:29:54,390 --> 01:29:57,393
<i>Do you have any evidence
to support this conclusion, Mr. Finch?</i>

1374
01:29:57,477 --> 01:30:00,104
No, sir. Just a feeling.

1375
01:30:00,188 --> 01:30:02,232
<i>If I am sure of anything, inspector,</i>

1376
01:30:02,315 --> 01:30:06,569
<i>it is that this government won't survive
if it is to be subject to your feelings.</i>

1377
01:30:06,653 --> 01:30:09,739
<i>Mr. Dascomb, what we need right now</i>

1378
01:30:09,822 --> 01:30:12,909
<i>is a clear message
to the people of this country.</i>

1379
01:30:12,992 --> 01:30:15,411
<i>This message must be read
in every newspaper,</i>

1380
01:30:15,495 --> 01:30:18,122
<i>heard on every radio,
seen on every television.</i>

1381
01:30:18,206 --> 01:30:22,335
<i>This message must resound
throughout the entire InterLink!</i>

1382
01:30:22,418 --> 01:30:26,005
<i>I want this country to realize
that we stand on the edge of oblivion.</i>

1383
01:30:26,089 --> 01:30:30,343
<i>I want every man, woman and child to
understand how close we are to chaos.</i>

1384
01:30:30,426 --> 01:30:32,470
<i>I want everyone</i>

1385
01:30:32,553 --> 01:30:36,349
<i>to remember why they need us!</i>

1386
01:30:36,432 --> 01:30:41,062
<i>In the former United States, civil war
continues to devastate the Midwest.</i>

1387
01:30:41,145 --> 01:30:45,525
<i>Scientists attribute this water shortage
to the lack of rainfall the last two years.</i>

1388
01:30:45,608 --> 01:30:48,861
<i>Ministry officials expect
water coupon prices to rise.</i>

1389
01:30:48,945 --> 01:30:50,947
<i>Police have arrested nine suspects.</i>

1390
01:30:51,030 --> 01:30:54,909
Can you believe this shit?
Been going on all summer.

1391
01:30:54,993 --> 01:30:59,038
<i>Outside the quarantine zone, a new
airborne pathogen has killed 27 people.</i>

1392
01:30:59,497 --> 01:31:03,543
<i>Authorities uncovered new evidence
linking the terrorist organization called V</i>

1393
01:31:04,002 --> 01:31:07,964
<i>to the St. Mary's viral attack
on London 14 years ago.</i>

1394
01:31:18,224 --> 01:31:19,851
[device beeps]

1395
01:31:19,934 --> 01:31:22,562
[Dominic] My friend inside the Finger
came up with something.

1396
01:31:22,895 --> 01:31:24,605
There were three men.

1397
01:31:24,689 --> 01:31:26,566
Covert intel.

1398
01:31:26,649 --> 01:31:29,027
Original black-baggers,
all under Creedy.

1399
01:31:30,028 --> 01:31:33,906
[Finch] Alan Percy, Robert Keyes,
William Rookwood.

1400
01:31:33,990 --> 01:31:36,159
The day after the St. Mary's outbreak,

1401
01:31:36,242 --> 01:31:39,704
Percy gives his Beretta a blowjob,
Keyes dies in a fire...

1402
01:31:39,787 --> 01:31:41,414
Rookwood goes missing.

1403
01:31:41,497 --> 01:31:44,500
Bloody coincidences
are making me sick to my stomach.

1404
01:31:44,584 --> 01:31:46,419
Rookwood.

1405
01:31:46,502 --> 01:31:48,421
How do I know that name?

1406
01:31:53,509 --> 01:31:58,681
[Dominic] Holy shit. He must have had
a hidden trip on his file at the Finger.

1407
01:31:58,765 --> 01:32:00,433
But how'd he know it was you?

1408
01:32:02,643 --> 01:32:04,187
What do we do?

1409
01:32:05,438 --> 01:32:08,149
I'm a cop. I have to know.

1410
01:32:16,657 --> 01:32:19,994
I came when they opened it.
It gave me the collywobbles.

1411
01:32:21,662 --> 01:32:23,289
Still does.

1412
01:32:33,508 --> 01:32:35,551
That's close enough, inspector.

1413
01:32:35,802 --> 01:32:36,969
[device beeps]

1414
01:32:37,053 --> 01:32:38,346
We're not wired.

1415
01:32:39,389 --> 01:32:42,934
I'm sorry, but a man in my position
survives by taking every precaution.

1416
01:32:43,017 --> 01:32:46,354
- You have information for us?
- No, you already have the information.

1417
01:32:46,437 --> 01:32:48,606
All the names and dates
are inside your head.

1418
01:32:48,689 --> 01:32:51,234
What you want,
what you really need, is a story.

1419
01:32:51,317 --> 01:32:53,361
A story can be true or false.

1420
01:32:54,028 --> 01:32:57,073
I leave such judgments to you,
inspector.

1421
01:32:57,907 --> 01:33:01,369
Our story begins,
as these stories often do,

1422
01:33:01,452 --> 01:33:04,664
with a young, up-and-coming politician.

1423
01:33:04,747 --> 01:33:08,793
He's a deeply religious man
and a member of the Conservative Party.

1424
01:33:09,001 --> 01:33:13,381
<i>He's completely single-minded and
has no regard for the political process.</i>

1425
01:33:13,464 --> 01:33:16,717
<i>The more power he attains,
the more obvious his zealotry</i>

1426
01:33:16,801 --> 01:33:19,429
<i>and the more aggressive
his supporters become.</i>

1427
01:33:20,304 --> 01:33:25,518
<i>Eventually, his party launches a special
project in the name of national security.</i>

1428
01:33:25,601 --> 01:33:29,021
<i>At first it's believed to be a search
for biological weapons</i>

1429
01:33:29,105 --> 01:33:31,983
<i>and it's pursued without regard
to its cost.</i>

1430
01:33:32,066 --> 01:33:35,903
<i>However, the true goal
of this project is power.</i>

1431
01:33:35,987 --> 01:33:38,823
<i>Complete and total hegemonic domination.</i>

1432
01:33:38,906 --> 01:33:41,534
<i>The project, however, ends violently.</i>

1433
01:33:42,910 --> 01:33:45,538
<i>But the efforts of those involved
are not in vain</i>

1434
01:33:45,621 --> 01:33:50,751
<i>for a new ability to wage war is born
from the blood of one of the victims.</i>

1435
01:33:50,835 --> 01:33:54,505
Imagine a virus,
the most terrifying virus you can

1436
01:33:54,589 --> 01:33:57,717
and then imagine that you
and you alone have the cure.

1437
01:33:57,800 --> 01:34:02,805
<i>But if your ultimate goal is power,
how best to use such a weapon?</i>

1438
01:34:02,889 --> 01:34:06,601
Well, it's at this point in our story
that along comes a spider.

1439
01:34:07,310 --> 01:34:09,228
<i>A man seemingly without a conscience</i>

1440
01:34:09,312 --> 01:34:11,689
<i>for whom the ends
always justify the means.</i>

1441
01:34:11,772 --> 01:34:15,443
<i>And it's he who suggests that their target
should not be an enemy of the country,</i>

1442
01:34:15,526 --> 01:34:17,487
<i>but rather, the country itself.</i>

1443
01:34:18,070 --> 01:34:20,990
<i>Three targets are chosen
to maximize the effect of the attack:</i>

1444
01:34:21,073 --> 01:34:24,076
<i>A school, a tube station
and a water-treatment plant.</i>

1445
01:34:24,160 --> 01:34:26,829
<i>Several hundred die
within the first few weeks.</i>

1446
01:34:26,913 --> 01:34:29,373
Three Waters has, in fact,
been contaminated.

1447
01:34:29,457 --> 01:34:32,168
Authorities are attempting to control
its deadly spread.

1448
01:34:32,251 --> 01:34:34,371
...sent a wave of destruction
through the Underground.

1449
01:34:35,087 --> 01:34:38,382
[Rookwood] <i>Fueled by the media,
fear and panic spread quickly,</i>

1450
01:34:38,466 --> 01:34:41,636
<i>fracturing and dividing
the country until, at last,</i>

1451
01:34:41,761 --> 01:34:43,804
<i>the true goal comes into view.</i>

1452
01:34:43,888 --> 01:34:45,556
Before the St. Mary's crises,

1453
01:34:45,640 --> 01:34:49,769
no one would've predicted the results
of the election that year. No one.

1454
01:34:49,852 --> 01:34:54,398
<i>And then not long after the election,
Io and behold, a miracle.</i>

1455
01:34:54,482 --> 01:34:57,109
<i>Some believed it was the work
of God himself.</i>

1456
01:34:57,193 --> 01:35:01,030
<i>But it was a pharmaceutical company
controlled by certain party members</i>

1457
01:35:01,113 --> 01:35:04,492
<i>that made them all obscenely rich.</i>

1458
01:35:04,575 --> 01:35:08,871
A year later, several extremists are tried,
found guilty and executed,

1459
01:35:08,955 --> 01:35:12,208
while a memorial is built
to canonize their victims.

1460
01:35:13,251 --> 01:35:18,047
But the end result,
the true genius of the plan, was the fear.

1461
01:35:18,130 --> 01:35:20,550
Fear became the ultimate tool
of this government.

1462
01:35:20,633 --> 01:35:23,344
Through it, our politician
was ultimately appointed

1463
01:35:23,427 --> 01:35:27,431
to the newly created position
of high chancellor.

1464
01:35:27,640 --> 01:35:30,226
The rest, as they say, is history.

1465
01:35:32,186 --> 01:35:36,274
- Can you prove any of this?
- Why do you think I'm still alive?

1466
01:35:38,859 --> 01:35:42,822
All right. We'd like to take you into
protective custody, Mr. Rookwood.

1467
01:35:42,905 --> 01:35:44,865
I'm sure you would.

1468
01:35:44,949 --> 01:35:49,954
But if you want that recording,
you'll do what I tell you to do.

1469
01:35:50,037 --> 01:35:53,082
Put Creedy under 24-hour surveillance.

1470
01:35:53,165 --> 01:35:56,127
When I feel safe he can't pick his nose
without you knowing,

1471
01:35:56,210 --> 01:35:57,753
I'll contact you again.

1472
01:35:57,837 --> 01:36:00,172
Till then, cheerio.

1473
01:36:01,799 --> 01:36:03,175
[Finch] Rookwood...

1474
01:36:04,802 --> 01:36:06,679
why didn't you come forward before?

1475
01:36:07,722 --> 01:36:09,140
What were you waiting for?

1476
01:36:09,223 --> 01:36:11,475
Well, for you, inspector.

1477
01:36:11,684 --> 01:36:13,436
I needed you.

1478
01:36:34,373 --> 01:36:36,500
[V] Shh, shh, shh.

1479
01:36:37,251 --> 01:36:40,504
[Beethoven's "Symphony No. 5"
playing over speaker]

1480
01:36:40,713 --> 01:36:42,840
What's he doing in the dark there?

1481
01:36:42,923 --> 01:36:45,551
Creepy Creedy.
Not sure I wanna know.

1482
01:36:45,635 --> 01:36:49,305
Sutler can no longer trust you,
can he, Mr. Creedy?

1483
01:36:49,388 --> 01:36:51,599
And we both know why.

1484
01:36:52,266 --> 01:36:54,685
After I destroy Parliament,

1485
01:36:54,769 --> 01:36:58,731
his only chance will be to offer them
someone else, some other piece of meat.

1486
01:36:58,814 --> 01:37:00,107
And who will that be?

1487
01:37:00,358 --> 01:37:02,526
You, Mr. Creedy.

1488
01:37:02,735 --> 01:37:06,238
A man as smart as you
has probably considered this.

1489
01:37:06,322 --> 01:37:10,201
A man as smart as you
probably has a plan.

1490
01:37:10,284 --> 01:37:13,537
That plan is the reason
Sutler no longer trusts you.

1491
01:37:13,621 --> 01:37:16,207
It's the reason why
you're being watched right now,

1492
01:37:16,290 --> 01:37:19,168
why there are eyes and ears
in every room of this house

01:49:39,866 --> 01:49:43,703
It took nearly 10 years to
clear the tracks and lay a bit of my own.

1659
01:49:45,664 --> 01:49:47,207
Let me show you.

1660
01:50:03,348 --> 01:50:06,935
- These tracks lead to Parliament.
- Yes.

1661
01:50:07,644 --> 01:50:09,688
Then it's really going to happen,
isn't it?

1662
01:50:09,771 --> 01:50:13,150
[V] It will if you want it to.

1663
01:50:13,608 --> 01:50:15,777
- What?
- This is my gift to you, Evey.

1664
01:50:16,319 --> 01:50:21,825
Everything that I have: my home,
my books, the gallery, this train,

1665
01:50:21,908 --> 01:50:24,953
I'm leaving to you to do with
what you will.

1666
01:50:25,036 --> 01:50:26,538
Is this another trick, V?

1667
01:50:26,621 --> 01:50:31,042
[V] No. No more tricks. No more lies.

1668
01:50:31,126 --> 01:50:33,128
Only truth.

1669
01:50:33,211 --> 01:50:36,465
And the truth is, you made me
understand that I was wrong,

1670
01:50:36,923 --> 01:50:41,845
that the choice to pull this lever
is not mine to make.

1671
01:50:42,053 --> 01:50:44,848
- Why?
- Because this world,

1672
01:50:44,931 --> 01:50:49,478
the world that I'm a part of and
that I helped shape, will end tonight.

1673
01:50:50,479 --> 01:50:52,564
And tomorrow,
a different world will begin

1674
01:50:52,647 --> 01:50:57,777
that different people will shape,
and this choice belongs to them.

1675
01:51:00,780 --> 01:51:02,616
Where are you going?

1676
01:51:02,908 --> 01:51:05,327
The time has come for me
to meet my maker

1677
01:51:05,410 --> 01:51:08,830
and to repay him in kind
for all that he's done.

1678
01:51:08,914 --> 01:51:11,791
V, wait!
Please, you don't have to do this.

1679
01:51:11,875 --> 01:51:14,503
You could let it go.
We could leave here together.

1680
01:51:14,586 --> 01:51:17,589
No. You were right about what I am.

1681
01:51:18,089 --> 01:51:20,091
I have no tree waiting for me.

1682
01:51:20,509 --> 01:51:25,055
All I want, all I deserve,
is at the end of that tunnel.

1683
01:51:25,138 --> 01:51:26,932
That's not true.

1684
01:51:53,542 --> 01:51:54,918
I can't.

1685
01:52:04,094 --> 01:52:05,637
<i>My fellow Englishmen...</i>

1686
01:52:06,179 --> 01:52:08,223
<i>tonight, our country,</i>

1687
01:52:08,306 --> 01:52:09,933
<i>that which we stand for</i>

1688
01:52:10,016 --> 01:52:11,726
<i>and all that we hold dear,</i>

1689
01:52:11,810 --> 01:52:15,689
<i>faces a grave and terrible threat.</i>

1690
01:52:15,772 --> 01:52:17,274
[soldier] The area's clean, sir.

1691
01:52:17,816 --> 01:52:21,695
<i>This violent and unparalleled assault
to our security</i>

1692
01:52:21,778 --> 01:52:23,613
<i>will not go undefended...</i>

1693
01:52:23,697 --> 01:52:25,073
Where is he?

1694
01:52:25,156 --> 01:52:26,241
<i>...or unpunished.</i>

1695
01:52:26,324 --> 01:52:28,577
[V] Penny for the Guy.

1696
01:52:28,660 --> 01:52:32,706
<i>Our enemy is an insidious one,
seeking to divide us</i>

1697
01:52:33,290 --> 01:52:37,794
<i>and destroy the very foundation
of our great nation.</i>

1698
01:52:37,877 --> 01:52:42,048
[V] I have kept my side of the bargain,
but have you kept yours?

1699
01:52:42,132 --> 01:52:43,383
Bring him down.

1700
01:52:43,466 --> 01:52:45,760
<i>Tonight we must remain steadfast.</i>

1701
01:52:46,219 --> 01:52:48,096
<i>We must remain determined.</i>

1702
01:52:48,179 --> 01:52:51,474
<i>But most of all, we must remain united.</i>

1703
01:52:54,728 --> 01:52:58,356
<i>Those caught tonight
in violation of curfew</i>

1704
01:52:58,440 --> 01:53:01,192
<i>will be considered in league
with our enemy</i>

1705
01:53:01,276 --> 01:53:04,613
<i>and prosecuted as a terrorist
without leniency or exception.</i>

1706
01:53:04,696 --> 01:53:06,281
I want to see his face.

1707
01:53:06,364 --> 01:53:09,909
<i>Tonight, I give you my most solemn vow</i>

1708
01:53:09,993 --> 01:53:12,495
<i>thatjustice will be swift,</i>

1709
01:53:12,579 --> 01:53:15,123
<i>it will be righteous,</i>

1710
01:53:15,206 --> 01:53:17,584
<i>and it will be without mercy.</i>

1711
01:53:19,711 --> 01:53:21,880
Oh, God. No.

1712
01:53:21,963 --> 01:53:25,967
[V] At last, we finally meet.

1713
01:53:26,051 --> 01:53:28,345
[sobbing]

1714
01:53:28,428 --> 01:53:30,847
I have something for you, chancellor.

1715
01:53:31,097 --> 01:53:32,932
A farewell gift.

1716
01:53:33,016 --> 01:53:36,728
For all the things you've done,
for the things you might have done,

1717
01:53:36,811 --> 01:53:38,855
and for the only thing you have left.

1718
01:53:41,232 --> 01:53:43,151
Goodbye, chancellor.

1719
01:53:44,152 --> 01:53:45,362
Mr. Creedy.

1720
01:53:47,697 --> 01:53:49,616
Disgusting.

1721
01:53:49,699 --> 01:53:51,618
[gunshot echoes]

1722
01:54:02,253 --> 01:54:04,422
Now that's done with,

1723
01:54:04,506 --> 01:54:08,385
it's time to have a look at your face.

1724
01:54:08,927 --> 01:54:10,470
Take off your mask.

1725
01:54:10,762 --> 01:54:12,013
[V] No.

1726
01:54:19,604 --> 01:54:21,272
[men grunting]

1727
01:54:27,404 --> 01:54:29,072
Defiant to the end, huh?

1728
01:54:30,990 --> 01:54:34,661
You won't cry like him, will you?
You're not afraid of death.

1729
01:54:34,744 --> 01:54:35,995
You're like me.

1730
01:54:36,079 --> 01:54:38,790
The only thing you and I
have in common, Mr. Creedy,

1731
01:54:38,873 --> 01:54:40,583
is we're both about to die.

1732
01:54:42,168 --> 01:54:44,003
How do you imagine that's gonna happen?

1733
01:54:44,087 --> 01:54:46,464
With my hands around your neck.

1734
01:54:48,675 --> 01:54:49,884
Bollocks.

1735
01:54:50,927 --> 01:54:53,179
What are you gonna do, huh?

1736
01:54:53,263 --> 01:54:55,473
We've swept this place.
You've got nothing.

1737
01:54:55,557 --> 01:55:00,019
Nothing but your bloody knives
and your fancy karate gimmicks.

1738
01:55:00,103 --> 01:55:01,771
We have guns.

1739
01:55:01,855 --> 01:55:05,191
No, you have bullets and the hope
that when your guns are empty,

1740
01:55:05,275 --> 01:55:07,444
I'm no longer standing, because if I am,

1741
01:55:08,319 --> 01:55:10,405
you'll all be dead before you've reloaded.

1742
01:55:10,739 --> 01:55:12,907
That's impossible!

1743
01:55:15,326 --> 01:55:16,369
Kill him.

1744
01:55:33,219 --> 01:55:35,722
[breathing heavily]

1745
01:55:41,019 --> 01:55:42,145
[V] My turn.

1746
01:56:09,589 --> 01:56:11,674

1747
01:56:24,479 --> 01:56:26,439

1748
01:56:53,800 --> 01:56:56,010
Die! Die!

1749
01:56:56,928 --> 01:56:59,055
Why won't you die?

1750
01:56:59,180 --> 01:57:01,432
- [gun clicks]
- Why won't you die?

1751
01:57:03,226 --> 01:57:06,396
Beneath this mask,
there is more than flesh.

1752
01:57:06,479 --> 01:57:09,399
Beneath this mask there is an idea,
Mr. Creedy.

1753
01:57:10,650 --> 01:57:12,944
And ideas are bulletproof.

1754
01:57:19,117 --> 01:57:20,451

[helicopter whirring]

1758
01:58:04,579 --> 01:58:07,749
This is perimeter one.
Whitehall is secure. Over.

1759
01:58:07,832 --> 01:58:09,208
[man] This is General Ackroyd.

1760
01:58:09,542 --> 01:58:11,169
Keep communication tight.

1761
01:58:11,252 --> 01:58:14,589
I won't have this getting any more
bollixed up than it already is.

1762
01:58:18,509 --> 01:58:19,844
V!

1763
01:58:22,889 --> 01:58:24,307
[V gasping]

1764
01:58:24,390 --> 01:58:27,018
Oh, God, we have to stop your bleeding.

1765
01:58:27,101 --> 01:58:31,314
Please, don't.
I'm finished and glad of it.

1766
01:58:31,648 --> 01:58:33,274
Don't say that.

1767
01:58:33,775 --> 01:58:36,694
I told you, only truth.

1768
01:58:40,156 --> 01:58:43,660
For 20 years, I sought only this day.

1769
01:58:43,743 --> 01:58:45,912
Nothing else existed...

1770
01:58:48,039 --> 01:58:50,041
until I saw you.

1771
01:58:51,167 --> 01:58:53,419
Then everything changed.

1772
01:58:54,837 --> 01:58:56,756
I fell in love with you, Evey...

1773
01:58:58,341 --> 01:59:01,552
like I no longer believed I could.

1774
01:59:01,636 --> 01:59:04,180
V, I don't want you to die.

1775
01:59:06,933 --> 01:59:10,728
That's the most beautiful thing

1776
01:59:10,812 --> 01:59:13,481
you could have ever given me.

1777
01:59:21,072 --> 01:59:22,490
V?

1778
01:59:23,700 --> 01:59:24,993
V?

Eyes and ears have detected movement
heading towards Trafalgar Square.

1781
01:59:38,548 --> 01:59:40,633
This is perimeter one.
We have enemy contact.

1782
02:00:12,832 --> 02:00:14,917
Hold it. Stop right there.

1783
02:00:18,337 --> 02:00:19,881
You're Evey Hammond, aren't you?

1784
02:00:27,847 --> 02:00:29,182
Then it's over?

1785
02:00:29,640 --> 02:00:30,850
Almost.

1786
02:00:30,933 --> 02:00:33,478
Stop. Get your hand off that lever.

1787
02:00:35,772 --> 02:00:36,939
No.

[lieutenant] Enemy is approaching fast.
Requesting orders.

1789
02:00:40,151 --> 02:00:42,487
- What shall we do?
- No response from Command.

1790
02:00:43,821 --> 02:00:45,740
Or from Party Leader Creedy.

1791
02:00:46,324 --> 02:00:47,700
Or from the high chancellor.

1792
02:00:48,576 --> 02:00:49,869
Why are you doing this?

1793
02:00:50,328 --> 02:00:52,747
- Because he was right.
- About what?

1794
02:00:52,830 --> 02:00:57,418
That this country needs more than
a building right now. It needs hope.

1795
02:01:02,381 --> 02:01:04,967
Bloody hell, stand down! Stand down!

It's time.

1799

Tell me...

1800
02:02:24,255 --> 02:02:26,757
do you like music, Mr. Finch?

Yes.

1804
02:02:50,698 --> 02:02:52,325

Who was he?

1808
02:03:27,026 --> 02:03:28,319
He was Edmond Dantes.

1809
02:03:30,446 --> 02:03:32,865
And he was my father

1810
02:03:32,949 --> 02:03:34,951
and my mother.

He was you...

1814
02:03:46,128 --> 02:03:47,546
and me.

1815
02:03:49,715 --> 02:03:51,634
