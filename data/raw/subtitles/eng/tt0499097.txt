1
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:57,743
Agent Ritter.

2
00:01:57,827 --> 00:02:00,704
What’s the CIA got for us today?

3
00:02:00,788 --> 00:02:02,122
Lieutenant Commander.

4
00:02:02,206 --> 00:02:04,291
Sun’s going down.
We should get to it.

5
00:02:10,506 --> 00:02:12,800
The hostage is a CIA operative.

6
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:14,552
We believe he is being held

7
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:16,762
by Syrian government forces
in a nearby building.

8
00:02:16,846 --> 00:02:19,223
Call sign is "Randy."
We approach from the south.

9
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:22,643
We should expect eyes on us
here and here.

10
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:26,105
How many Syrian troops
are we talking about?

11
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:28,107
I don’t have that information.

12
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,651
Well, that was a good talk.

13
00:02:33,028 --> 00:02:34,989
- You a comedian? Is that it?
- No, no, no.

14
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:37,074
He’s just a bit of a smart-ass.

15
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,717
No, that’s not right.
I’m the smart-ass.

16
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:40,327
Yeah, he’s, uh...
he’s more of a badass.

17
00:02:40,411 --> 00:02:42,204
- Oh.
- Yeah.

18
00:02:42,288 --> 00:02:43,873
Let’s move.

19
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:10,357
Three, two, one.

20
00:03:40,012 --> 00:03:41,931
Clear!

21
00:03:47,186 --> 00:03:48,687
Hostage identity confirmed.

22
00:03:48,771 --> 00:03:50,564
It’s him.

23
00:03:50,648 --> 00:03:51,815
Let’s move.

24
00:03:53,317 --> 00:03:54,878
- What the hell is this, Ritter?
- I got you, man.

25
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:56,904
These are ex-Russian military.

26
00:03:56,987 --> 00:04:00,074
You said Syrian army,
not Russians.

27
00:04:01,492 --> 00:04:03,410
I don’t see any Russians.

28
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:07,081
Okay, what are we waiting for?
Let’s go.

29
00:04:12,211 --> 00:04:13,963
Let’s move.

30
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:19,885
RPG!

31
00:04:19,969 --> 00:04:21,345
- Get back!
- Take cover!

32
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:52,209
Greer!

33
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:01,343
We got a man down.
We need an extraction.

34
00:05:01,427 --> 00:05:03,679
Priority is
securing the hostage.

35
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:05,806
We rendezvous at the exfil.
Let’s move!

36
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:10,978
Hang on!

37
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,235
Team member Russell is dead!

38
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,570
Move him to the exfil!

39
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:25,659
Smoke-out!

40
00:05:43,761 --> 00:05:47,097
PMCs, Russian transpo.

41
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:48,390
Ritter lied.

42
00:05:48,474 --> 00:05:49,808
This isn’t a safe house.

43
00:05:49,892 --> 00:05:51,769
It’s a Russian arms depot.

44
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:53,353
Yeah, no shit.

45
00:05:53,437 --> 00:05:55,189
Fire in the hole.

46
00:05:58,108 --> 00:05:59,860
On me.

47
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:01,570
Got your back.

48
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,261
Ritter, explain the Russians!

49
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:09,847
They weren’t just contractors.
They were Russian military.

50
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:16,311
But you knew that, didn’t you?

51
00:07:26,822 --> 00:07:28,448
Confirm target.

52
00:07:28,532 --> 00:07:30,701
Eagle Six.
Yes, target is confirmed.

53
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:32,911
Need an air strike at grid

54
00:07:32,995 --> 00:07:36,373
November Papa six seven
five two niner zero.

55
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:39,334
I should’ve been fully briefed.

56
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:41,211
The Russians killed
one of my men.

57
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:43,005
Well, that’s the job,
sweetheart.

58
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:45,048
Yeah, bullshit.

59
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:47,384
Stand down.
Do it, Senior Chief.

60
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,428
- Now.
- What are you doing?

61
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:53,599
Attaboy!

62
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:29,760
You want to hear
something romantic?

63
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:32,596
Yeah? What’s that?

64
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,306
This isn’t your baby.

65
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:39,895
Oh, you cold-blooded.

66
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:43,774
Listen, you gonna park your butt
right over here on this couch.

67
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,484
Cold.

68
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,319
You crazy.

69
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:49,446
Uh, no, it’s all good.

70
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,448
I’ll go get something for you.

71
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,659
Okay.

72
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:55,077
Want some water?

73
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,537
Uh, I want some wine.

74
00:08:57,621 --> 00:08:59,539
Okay, I’ll take an iced tea.

75
00:08:59,623 --> 00:09:01,083
Okay, that’s better.

76
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:02,793
With some sugar.

77
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:04,586
I got you.

78
00:09:08,924 --> 00:09:10,735
Yeah, they need that,
but we also got to figure out

79
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:12,135
why they acting out so much.

80
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:14,012
We got to, like,
help these teachers out

81
00:09:14,096 --> 00:09:15,514
- in the public schools.
- Mm-hmm.

82
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:16,783
- Hey.
- Oh, babe, I was just about

83
00:09:16,807 --> 00:09:18,284
- to bring it to you.
- No, no, that’s okay.

84
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:19,977
Sister Easton was
talking my ear off,

85
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,895
so it’s safer in here.

86
00:09:21,979 --> 00:09:23,373
Yeah, that’s facts.

87
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:24,564
She got you, didn’t she?

88
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:27,210
Pam’s been telling us
you got yourself

89
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:28,360
a fancy new job, right?

90
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:30,404
Well, no, he’s been
offered the job.

91
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:32,281
- He hasn’t taken it yet.
- Oh.

92
00:09:32,364 --> 00:09:34,324
It’s, uh...
it’s private security.

93
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:36,410
Good hours, good pay.

94
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:39,496
Mm-hmm.

95
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:43,208
Well, it’s a big step,
retiring from the military.

96
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:47,087
- When are you due again?
- Oh.

97
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:49,214
- Next month, the 17th.
- Oh, next month, the 17th.

98
00:09:49,298 --> 00:09:51,133
Oh, man, I remember
when we had our first.

99
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:54,011
Oh, my God, you think combat
keeps you up at night,

100
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:56,388
you just wait till
that little joker gets hungry.

101
00:09:59,016 --> 00:10:00,642
He gonna dropkick you.

102
00:10:00,726 --> 00:10:03,395
It’s a girl.

103
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:05,439
A girl.
Oh, now you’re in trouble.

104
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:16,700
- One of these?
- Finished?

105
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:19,077
Babe, could you help me
take out the garbage, please?

106
00:10:19,161 --> 00:10:20,954
- Yes.
- Yeah, sure.

107
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:27,544
Daddy, you said
you’d play Twister!

108
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,047
All right, all right,
just give me a second.

109
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:09,419
You remember this night?

110
00:11:09,503 --> 00:11:11,421
Yeah, I remember
that dress and them shoes.

111
00:11:12,923 --> 00:11:14,466
I remember your hair.

112
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:23,058
I am on my way.
I just got stuck in a...

113
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:25,310
Jesus, man, come on!

114
00:11:25,394 --> 00:11:27,229
Where are you coming from?

115
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:29,398
Um...

116
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:31,775
I was at Happy’s
with some of the boys.

117
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:34,277
Another boys’ night
with your Navy SEALs?

118
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:36,071
Babe, please, don’t start.

119
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:38,990
What the...?

120
00:11:40,117 --> 00:11:42,035
Baby? Hello?

121
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:43,829
Hello?

122
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:48,250
What happened?

123
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:49,918
How’s my girl?

124
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:52,087
Pregnant.

125
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:54,339
You should try it.

126
00:11:54,423 --> 00:11:58,051
Oh, actually, I was
talking about my other girl.

127
00:11:58,135 --> 00:12:00,137
- Oh. Excuse me.
- Mm-hmm.

128
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,180
So, what, you doing good, baby?

129
00:12:02,264 --> 00:12:04,307
Daddy can’t wait
for you to get here.

130
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:07,018
We got your room all picked out.

131
00:12:07,102 --> 00:12:09,229
Yeah, wait. What was that?

132
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:11,731
Oh. She says she’s gonna be
a daddy’s girl.

133
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:13,775
- Oh, God, I doubt it.
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.

134
00:12:13,859 --> 00:12:15,652
It’s two against one.

135
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,446
You know what? I surrender.

136
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:19,364
I know when I’m outnumbered.

137
00:12:21,158 --> 00:12:24,828
Ugh.

138
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:30,584
Now, you know...

139
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:34,796
...how much it turns me on
when you wear my socks, right?

140
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,381
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

141
00:12:36,465 --> 00:12:37,674
And you got ’em on.

142
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,384
- Mm-mm.
- Mm-hmm.

143
00:12:39,468 --> 00:12:41,928
John, no, I really need
to go to sleep tonight.

144
00:12:42,012 --> 00:12:43,930
No, I know, you...
you can go to sleep.

145
00:12:44,014 --> 00:12:45,616
- No.
- I just... It’s gonna be quick.

146
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,058
- It’ll be quick. I promise.
- No.

147
00:12:47,142 --> 00:12:48,518
Mm, stop.

148
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:50,645
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

149
00:12:50,729 --> 00:12:53,148
Goodbye.

150
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:56,193
And don’t stay downstairs
all night listening to music.

151
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:58,028

Pam.

172
00:17:52,489 --> 00:17:54,282
Baby?

173
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:04,417
Pam.

174
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:09,047
No.

175
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:11,216
No. No.

176
00:18:51,506 --> 00:18:54,050
What we know is
three perps are dead

177
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,094
and Senior Chief Kelly
is in critical condition,

178
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:57,971
isn’t likely to pull through.

179
00:18:58,054 --> 00:19:00,348
Also killed was his wife.

180
00:19:00,431 --> 00:19:02,791
Uh, Kelly is the third member
of the Special Operations unit

181
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:05,228
to be attacked
in the last 24 hours.

182
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:07,814
FBI has provided the remaining
team members and their families

183
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:10,733
access to security
and protective custody.

184
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:12,569
We have to be alert
to the fact that

185
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:14,505
these SEALs get themselves
into all worlds of trouble.

186
00:19:14,529 --> 00:19:16,781
Drugs, arms, information.

187
00:19:16,865 --> 00:19:18,783
And keeping that in mind,
we are taking

188
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:21,995
every possible scenario
into consideration.

189
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:23,973
- Yes.
- Ritter!

190
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:25,582
What the hell was that

191
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:28,167
"every possible scenario"
bullshit in there?

192
00:19:28,251 --> 00:19:30,545
My men were not dirty,
and you know it.

193
00:19:32,255 --> 00:19:34,173
What is the whole story?

194
00:19:34,257 --> 00:19:35,842
And don’t bullshit me, Ritter.

195
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:38,011
Today is not the day for it.

196
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:41,264
We’re looking into it.

197
00:19:43,308 --> 00:19:47,478
How come both times
my world has gone to shit,

198
00:19:47,562 --> 00:19:49,856
you’re standing
in the middle of it?

199
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:55,361
Just good luck, I guess.

200
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:39,656
I need a doctor!

201
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:41,950
Code blue!

202
00:20:42,033 --> 00:20:43,868
- Check his pulse.
- BP’s dropping.

203
00:20:43,952 --> 00:20:46,204
- Start chest compressions.
- I got you.

204
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:10,937
The baby.

205
00:21:43,386 --> 00:21:45,388
Know who’s behind it?

206
00:21:49,142 --> 00:21:50,893
I don’t know.

207
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:56,899
Pros.

208
00:21:58,234 --> 00:22:00,111
They were pros.

209
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,619
The guy they found
in my bedroom...

210
00:22:11,289 --> 00:22:13,291
I didn’t kill him.

211
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:19,213
He was already dead
when I got there.

212
00:22:25,803 --> 00:22:27,889
One got away.

213
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,562
All I need...

214
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:39,275
...is a name.

215
00:22:42,779 --> 00:22:44,655
Give me a name.

216
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:50,661
Even if I knew...

217
00:22:54,248 --> 00:22:56,250
...you know I can’t do that.

218
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:15,770
Which part of "please knock"
wasn’t clear?

219
00:23:18,648 --> 00:23:20,900
Excuse me, Mr. Secretary.

220
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:22,318
My apologies, sir.

221
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:24,445
No need.

222
00:23:24,529 --> 00:23:26,906
I would’ve been disappointed
with anything less.

223
00:23:31,244 --> 00:23:32,787
Special assignment to the DoD.

224
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:34,288
It’s impressive.

225
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:38,918
You even got a window.

226
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:40,795
Please.

227
00:23:43,047 --> 00:23:46,008
I did some work with your uncle.

228
00:23:46,092 --> 00:23:49,137
Jim Greer is
one hell of an operative.

229
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:51,055
If you say so, sir.

230
00:23:53,349 --> 00:23:56,811
He speaks very highly of you
and your judgment.

231
00:23:58,146 --> 00:24:01,691
Which is why I would like
to talk to you about John Kelly.

232
00:24:04,402 --> 00:24:07,822
Lieutenant Commander,
in your opinion,

233
00:24:07,905 --> 00:24:10,741
how far can Kelly be trusted?

234
00:24:16,247 --> 00:24:18,249
You know the drill.

235
00:24:19,834 --> 00:24:22,253
Chest press to 15.
Let’s go.

236
00:24:55,161 --> 00:24:57,830
Lieutenant Commander, come in.

237
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:02,001
Uh...

238
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:04,921
Mr. Secretary, all due respect,
the director made it clear

239
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:07,381
I was to brief you and you only.

240
00:25:07,465 --> 00:25:09,008
Hmm.

241
00:25:09,091 --> 00:25:10,551
Take a seat.

242
00:25:10,635 --> 00:25:12,345
I asked the CIA to brief me

243
00:25:12,428 --> 00:25:14,347
on the situation
relating to your men.

244
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:15,890
I thought you’d like
to be present.

245
00:25:15,973 --> 00:25:17,475
Thank you, sir.

246
00:25:23,397 --> 00:25:25,024
Yuri Zelin.

247
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:27,276
Son of Nikolay Zelin,
head of the FSB.

248
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:33,491
This is Yuri in Aleppo
an hour before our assault.

249
00:25:33,574 --> 00:25:36,285
Lieutenant Commander’s team
killed him on the second floor.

250
00:25:37,495 --> 00:25:39,181
Now, what he was doing there,
we don’t know,

251
00:25:39,205 --> 00:25:43,292
but Webb, Rowdy and Kelly
all seem to have been payback.

252
00:25:43,376 --> 00:25:47,213
All the men Kelly killed
in his house had FSB links.

253
00:25:48,339 --> 00:25:51,008
So you are actually telling me

254
00:25:51,092 --> 00:25:53,886
the massacres of our men
and their families

255
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:56,305
were foreign attacks
on U.S. soil.

256
00:25:56,389 --> 00:25:58,683
Russians.

257
00:25:58,766 --> 00:26:01,435
By proxy.

258
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:05,022
None of them were connected to
Russia in an official capacity.

259
00:26:05,106 --> 00:26:06,625
Did you know Russia
was dealing weapons

260
00:26:06,649 --> 00:26:08,818
out of Aleppo when we went in?

261
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:10,945
Oh, we had a feeling.

262
00:26:13,614 --> 00:26:16,450
We’re a man short.

263
00:26:16,534 --> 00:26:19,287
Kelly said one of
the Russians got away.

264
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:21,330
There’s three men here.
Where’s the fourth?

265
00:26:21,414 --> 00:26:23,332
Uh, it doesn’t matter.

266
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:27,628
The CIA’s position on this
moving forward

267
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:29,338
is that the matter is closed.

268
00:26:29,422 --> 00:26:31,507
What?

269
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,635
The director considers
the score even.

270
00:26:34,719 --> 00:26:36,971
She feels, uh,

271
00:26:37,054 --> 00:26:39,473
it’s unnecessary
to poke the bear any further.

272
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:48,399
If Sarah believes
there’s not enough intel

273
00:26:48,482 --> 00:26:51,110
for me to generate a response,
my hands are tied.

274
00:26:51,193 --> 00:26:53,195
For now.

275
00:27:00,494 --> 00:27:02,496
Get your mug.

276
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:27,146
We celebrating something?

277
00:27:27,229 --> 00:27:28,898
Drink.

278
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:36,155
That’s an order.

279
00:27:49,627 --> 00:27:51,545
I finally understand
how you felt

280
00:27:51,629 --> 00:27:53,839
on that helicopter in Syria.

281
00:27:53,923 --> 00:27:55,800
About Ritter.

282
00:27:58,135 --> 00:28:00,805
CIA doesn’t support
any further investigation

283
00:28:00,888 --> 00:28:04,016
into the attacks
or Pam’s murder.

284
00:28:06,602 --> 00:28:08,521
Came straight from
the director’s office.

285
00:28:08,604 --> 00:28:12,108
They’re calling it
national security.

286
00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:13,831
They know it was
Russian nationals, and...

287
00:28:13,901 --> 00:28:15,528
Jesus.

288
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:18,614
...it’s just a file on a
classified server somewhere now.

289
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:28,707
Shit.

290
00:28:31,377 --> 00:28:34,130
Probably gonna go
to jail for this.

291
00:28:35,756 --> 00:28:37,508
But hey.

292
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:42,263
These are your toe tags.

293
00:28:47,184 --> 00:28:49,854
I got ’em from Secretary Clay.

294
00:28:52,314 --> 00:28:55,234
- Where’s the fourth?
- Your survivor’s a ghost.

295
00:28:55,317 --> 00:28:59,071
But these three were cleared
by the chief of intel.

296
00:29:00,114 --> 00:29:02,533
Andre Vaseliev, ex-FSB.

297
00:29:02,616 --> 00:29:04,702
He’s the one
who issued their passports.

298
00:29:04,785 --> 00:29:07,621
Vaseliev.

299
00:29:07,705 --> 00:29:10,541
He’ll know
who the fourth man is.

300
00:29:11,959 --> 00:29:14,879
- Anybody talk to him yet?
- Nope.

301
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:17,965
He’s full-on untouchable.

302
00:32:16,769 --> 00:32:18,646
Watch out there. Whoa.

303
00:32:18,729 --> 00:32:20,147
What are you doing, man?
Come on.

304
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:22,650
Hey. You watch out.

305
00:32:22,733 --> 00:32:24,777
- Hey, you.
- That your brother?

306
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:27,571
- What? What?
- Blow me.

307
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,703
Hey. Hey.

308
00:32:34,787 --> 00:32:36,431
- You got to get out of here.
- Look, I-I got... I got...

309
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:37,849
- I got a jacket, too. Look.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

310
00:32:37,873 --> 00:32:39,184
- I-I just...
- Keep it moving. Keep it moving.

311
00:32:39,208 --> 00:32:40,769
- I just want to show you my jacket.
- No, no, no, no.

312
00:32:40,793 --> 00:32:41,978
- You guys...
- You got to keep it moving.

313
00:32:42,002 --> 00:32:43,229
Can we trade?
Can we trade jackets?

314
00:32:43,253 --> 00:32:44,338
No. Back up. Back up.

315
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:45,899
I get it. I get it.
I just need to go...

316
00:32:45,923 --> 00:32:47,609
- No. Get back. Take a step...
- Get by.

317
00:32:47,633 --> 00:32:49,235
- I got to get through.
- No, you don’t. No, you don’t.

318
00:32:49,259 --> 00:32:50,945
- You need to go this way.
- I got to go that way.

319
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,572
- No, you don’t. You need to step...
- I-I...

320
00:32:52,596 --> 00:32:55,057
- Okay, okay. All right, okay.
- I told you, get back!

321
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,434
Okay, okay.

322
00:32:57,518 --> 00:32:59,645
Okay, I just...

323
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:04,149
I just need to go...

324
00:33:25,546 --> 00:33:27,840
911. What’s the nature
of your emergency?

325
00:33:27,923 --> 00:33:30,509
Hey, I’m dropping off somebody
at Dulles Airport,

326
00:33:30,592 --> 00:33:32,928
and I see a car swerving
in and out of the lanes.

327
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:35,013
I pulled up next to him,
and, um,

328
00:33:35,097 --> 00:33:36,640
I hate to be this guy,

329
00:33:36,724 --> 00:33:38,559
but I’m pretty sure
he flashed a gun at me.

330
00:33:38,642 --> 00:33:40,018
Dark SUV.

331
00:33:40,102 --> 00:33:42,813
License plate
R-T-five-six-two-nine.

332
00:33:42,896 --> 00:33:45,482
Hurry up.
I’m-I’m really scared.

333
00:34:10,883 --> 00:34:14,928
Why does it take so much time
to get rid of the police?

334
00:34:16,472 --> 00:34:20,601
Don’t worry, Mr. Vaseliev.
I’ll get you to the gate.

335
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:07,606
Yeah, you remember me? Huh?

336
00:35:07,689 --> 00:35:09,024
Who killed my wife? Huh?

337
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:10,692
Who was the fourth guy
at my house?

338
00:35:10,776 --> 00:35:12,236
Give me a name.

339
00:35:14,696 --> 00:35:17,366
You give me a name.

340
00:35:21,245 --> 00:35:23,080
Okay.

341
00:35:23,163 --> 00:35:25,082
I’ll give you a name.

342
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:28,210
John Kelly.

343
00:35:29,503 --> 00:35:32,464
You are the problem, John.

344
00:35:32,548 --> 00:35:34,174
You’re supposed to be dead,

345
00:35:34,258 --> 00:35:36,176
so wherever you go,
death will follow.

346
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,097
Yeah.

347
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,723
Yeah, I punctured your lung.

348
00:35:41,807 --> 00:35:44,101
My wife Pam,
she drowned in her own blood.

349
00:35:44,184 --> 00:35:45,978
Now, you give me a name.

350
00:35:46,061 --> 00:35:47,813
Give me a name,
and I’ll make it quick.

351
00:35:50,566 --> 00:35:52,568
Viktor Rykov.

352
00:35:54,486 --> 00:35:55,713
He’s exiting the vehicle!

353
00:35:55,737 --> 00:35:57,281
Get down!
Hands where we can see ’em!

354
00:35:57,364 --> 00:35:58,764
- Let us see your hands!
- Get down!

355
00:35:58,824 --> 00:36:00,284
- I’m military!
- Turn around.

356
00:36:00,367 --> 00:36:01,845
- Hands up!
- Don’t shoot! I’m military!

357
00:36:01,869 --> 00:36:03,287
Get your hands behind your head!

358
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:06,290
Literally hours
before the Dulles attack,

359
00:36:06,373 --> 00:36:08,709
an anonymous source releases
classified documents

360
00:36:08,792 --> 00:36:11,044
that tie the Russian government
to the attacks

361
00:36:11,128 --> 00:36:14,172
on our Navy SEALs
here in the U.S.,

362
00:36:14,256 --> 00:36:16,675
and you’re telling me
that’s coincidental?

363
00:36:16,758 --> 00:36:18,844
I’m saying I’d be wary
about accusing

364
00:36:18,927 --> 00:36:21,305
the Russian state
of assassinating

365
00:36:21,388 --> 00:36:23,515
U.S. service members
on American soil.

366
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:29,271
We didn’t leak
the Russian thing.

367
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:30,814
I mean, why would we?

368
00:36:30,898 --> 00:36:32,733
We were the ones
trying to cover it up.

369
00:36:36,653 --> 00:36:38,405
And as a courtesy,
Director Dillard thought

370
00:36:38,488 --> 00:36:41,116
you might want to know
how Kelly got to Vaseliev.

371
00:36:42,993 --> 00:36:44,661
Lieutenant Commander Greer?

372
00:36:44,745 --> 00:36:46,246
Yeah, we can’t prove it.

373
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:49,625
Although, as I recall,
you were quite insistent

374
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:51,919
that she be briefed
on the matter.

375
00:36:52,961 --> 00:36:55,130
She did seem resourceful.

376
00:36:57,591 --> 00:37:00,344
There is the obvious concern
that this new development

377
00:37:00,427 --> 00:37:02,512
sends the wrong message
to Moscow.

378
00:37:02,596 --> 00:37:04,264
The wrong message?

379
00:37:06,266 --> 00:37:08,477
They hit us at home.

380
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,604
Now they’re paying attention.

381
00:37:10,687 --> 00:37:13,440
And Kelly has
a big target on his back.

382
00:37:13,523 --> 00:37:16,401
Even in prison,
he won’t be safe.

383
00:37:16,485 --> 00:37:20,697
Some situations warrant
thinking outside the box.

384
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:28,622
Has it occurred to you
that John Kelly

385
00:37:28,705 --> 00:37:31,458
perhaps has done
something we can’t?

386
00:37:32,626 --> 00:37:34,753
He shook a tree
that needed shaking.

387
00:37:34,836 --> 00:37:36,088
So...

388
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:39,132
...let’s see who else falls out.

389
00:37:40,133 --> 00:37:43,220
You’re pretty messy right now.

390
00:37:43,303 --> 00:37:45,806
In more ways than one.

391
00:37:45,889 --> 00:37:47,891
No, I’m not.

392
00:37:50,102 --> 00:37:52,688
I spent half my life
playing that game.

393
00:37:55,482 --> 00:37:58,318
I’m the one that went to hell
and did their dirty work.

394
00:37:59,987 --> 00:38:02,864
We served a country
that didn’t love us back.

395
00:38:04,324 --> 00:38:07,285
Because we believed
in what it could be.

396
00:38:07,369 --> 00:38:10,414
We fought for what
America could be.

397
00:38:12,082 --> 00:38:14,084
But they crossed a line.

398
00:38:15,419 --> 00:38:17,963
They brought their war
into my house.

399
00:38:21,508 --> 00:38:23,510
They took my wife.

400
00:38:27,556 --> 00:38:29,099
And they took my baby girl

401
00:38:29,182 --> 00:38:31,393
before she got a chance
to take a breath.

402
00:38:35,188 --> 00:38:37,524
That contract is broken.

403
00:38:39,151 --> 00:38:41,153
They’re gonna play
by my rules now.

404
00:38:42,946 --> 00:38:46,158
I’ll show them
what a pawn can do to a king.

405
00:38:50,746 --> 00:38:52,748
The files you got
on those Russians,

406
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:55,709
Secretary Clay gave it
to you, right?

407
00:38:55,792 --> 00:38:57,627
I need you to get
a message to him.

408
00:39:00,005 --> 00:39:02,007
That’s impossible, John.

409
00:39:03,383 --> 00:39:05,677
But I found out something.

410
00:39:07,929 --> 00:39:09,973
What do you have?

411
00:39:10,057 --> 00:39:11,683
No.

412
00:39:11,767 --> 00:39:13,310
If he wants to know what I know,

413
00:39:13,393 --> 00:39:15,937
then you got to get me
out of here, and fast.

414
00:39:17,731 --> 00:39:20,942
Why do you think I ended up
in a prison full of Russian mob?

415
00:39:21,026 --> 00:39:22,903
Think about it.

416
00:39:27,657 --> 00:39:29,743
They can get to me in here.

417
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:46,069
On your feet.

418
00:40:46,153 --> 00:40:48,446
Turn around and face the wall.

419
00:40:50,365 --> 00:40:52,409
Now, why would I do that?

420
00:40:52,492 --> 00:40:55,287
I’m taking you on a little trip.

421
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:58,707
Nah, I’m good right here.

422
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:01,960
Stand up and face the wall.

423
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:06,631
If you can’t tell me
where I’m going,

424
00:41:06,715 --> 00:41:08,717
I’m not moving.

425
00:42:20,664 --> 00:42:22,499
- Go, go, go, go!
- Move, move!

426
00:42:46,606 --> 00:42:48,459
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Close the door,

427
00:42:48,483 --> 00:42:50,026
or I’m-a start snapping necks!

428
00:43:08,545 --> 00:43:10,213
Make a hole.

429
00:43:10,297 --> 00:43:13,008
Ma’am, approaching John now.

430
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:22,559
Senior Chief Kelly.

431
00:43:22,642 --> 00:43:25,520
I’m United States Marshal
Kevin Townsend.

432
00:43:26,771 --> 00:43:29,190
I’m gonna slide a phone
through your hatch.

433
00:43:29,274 --> 00:43:31,359
Somebody would like
to talk to you.

434
00:43:31,443 --> 00:43:33,153
Drop it in.

435
00:43:37,115 --> 00:43:38,575
This is John.

436
00:43:38,658 --> 00:43:40,827
John, it’s me.

437
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:42,746
We’re getting you out of there.

438
00:43:42,829 --> 00:43:44,622
Follow the U.S. Marshal.

439
00:43:44,706 --> 00:43:46,166
You can trust him.

440
00:43:49,544 --> 00:43:51,713
Unless you’re not done.

441
00:43:53,256 --> 00:43:55,050
I’m done.

442
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:12,650
You know you messed up
when they send a motorcade.

443
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:16,196
Buddy, they’re gonna write songs

444
00:44:16,279 --> 00:44:18,323
about all the shit
you messed up.

445
00:44:45,809 --> 00:44:47,227
This way.

446
00:44:57,946 --> 00:44:59,697
Mr. Secretary.

447
00:44:59,781 --> 00:45:01,408
Senior Chief John Kelly.

448
00:45:01,491 --> 00:45:03,118
John.

449
00:45:04,536 --> 00:45:07,205
Have you met Sarah Dillard?
She runs the CIA.

450
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:10,583
And Robert Ritter,
also from the C...

451
00:45:10,667 --> 00:45:12,502
I know him.

452
00:45:14,087 --> 00:45:16,798
So, what have you learned?

453
00:45:16,881 --> 00:45:19,259
Make our trip down here
worthwhile.

454
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,722
Viktor Rykov.

455
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:32,021
How do you know that name?

456
00:45:32,105 --> 00:45:35,442
He was the fourth gunman
at my house.

457
00:45:35,525 --> 00:45:37,277
He killed my wife.

458
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:39,571
Viktor Rykov is dead.

459
00:45:39,654 --> 00:45:41,364
Who the hell is Viktor Rykov?

460
00:45:43,408 --> 00:45:45,827
He’s classified.

461
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:47,787
Tell the man.

462
00:45:51,708 --> 00:45:53,793
Viktor Anatoly Rykov.

463
00:45:53,877 --> 00:45:55,837
Born in Tyumen.
Parents died early.

464
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,506
Moved to the U.S.
as a young child for a time.

465
00:45:58,590 --> 00:46:00,383
Suspected Russian
special forces.

466
00:46:00,467 --> 00:46:03,678
Counterespionage, FSB, weapons.

467
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:05,472
His ideology was post-Soviet.

468
00:46:05,555 --> 00:46:07,158
He believed the West
could be brought down

469
00:46:07,182 --> 00:46:09,392
by a series of strategic attacks
on American soil.

470
00:46:09,476 --> 00:46:12,562
He was a planner and a doer.

471
00:46:12,645 --> 00:46:15,690
He had an established set
of embedded agents.

472
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:18,693
That is, until we, uh...

473
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:20,361
sanctioned him.

474
00:46:20,445 --> 00:46:22,530
Or thought we sanctioned him.

475
00:46:24,949 --> 00:46:26,868
Tran.

476
00:46:26,951 --> 00:46:28,369
Can you reassure us

477
00:46:28,453 --> 00:46:29,933
that Mr. Kelly
wouldn’t know Mr. Rykov

478
00:46:29,996 --> 00:46:31,664
if he was standing
in front of him?

479
00:46:31,748 --> 00:46:33,583
Put him in a lineup, please.

480
00:46:40,006 --> 00:46:41,841
Top right.

481
00:46:43,343 --> 00:46:45,720
Yeah, that’s him.

482
00:46:56,272 --> 00:47:00,109
If it is him, what do we do?

483
00:47:00,193 --> 00:47:04,239
If Rykov is alive, we need
to find him and bring him in.

484
00:47:04,322 --> 00:47:06,324
We know his M.O.

485
00:47:06,407 --> 00:47:08,618
We have to assume that
this operation is not a one-off.

486
00:47:08,701 --> 00:47:10,203
Think about it.

487
00:47:11,788 --> 00:47:13,706
And, uh,

488
00:47:13,790 --> 00:47:16,000
if I had to guess, he’s probably
staged out of Russia.

489
00:47:16,084 --> 00:47:18,086
I need to be on that team.

490
00:47:18,169 --> 00:47:20,296
Thank you, John, sincerely,

491
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:23,132
but we’ll take it from here.

492
00:47:23,216 --> 00:47:25,635
Lieutenant Commander,
you’ll head the mission.

493
00:47:25,718 --> 00:47:28,263
You’ll be making an extraction.

494
00:47:28,346 --> 00:47:31,057
- I suggest you prepare a list.
- No, no.

495
00:47:32,517 --> 00:47:34,117
I think I’ve shown
that I’m willing to go

496
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:37,605
further than anyone
to get the job done.

497
00:47:37,689 --> 00:47:40,233
Consider what I did in Dulles
as an audition.

498
00:47:42,694 --> 00:47:46,447
Sir, if this guy’s
as bad as he says he is,

499
00:47:46,531 --> 00:47:49,033
then you need somebody like me.

500
00:47:49,117 --> 00:47:50,994
And there’s nobody like me.

501
00:47:51,077 --> 00:47:54,497
I don’t think
that would be optimal, sir.

502
00:47:54,581 --> 00:47:56,916
It is my opinion
that Senior Chief Kelly is not

503
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,836
in the right state of mind
to be in the field right now.

504
00:48:06,509 --> 00:48:09,095
With all due respect,

505
00:48:09,178 --> 00:48:11,681
I think he’s perfectly suited.

506
00:48:14,976 --> 00:48:17,186
He goes, too.

507
00:48:20,982 --> 00:48:23,026
But after the mission,
you will return

508
00:48:23,109 --> 00:48:26,112
to the penitentiary as a felon.

509
00:48:30,867 --> 00:48:33,453
Never jumped from
a passenger jet before.

510
00:48:33,536 --> 00:48:34,871
It’s modified.

511
00:48:34,954 --> 00:48:37,248
You’ll jump out
of the cargo door.

512
00:48:37,332 --> 00:48:39,250
But backstopping
an unplanned flight

513
00:48:39,334 --> 00:48:41,669
over Germany to Russia
takes time.

514
00:48:41,753 --> 00:48:44,130
The route from Leipzig
to Anchorage is already cleared.

515
00:48:44,213 --> 00:48:45,548
Goes right over the DZ.

516
00:48:45,632 --> 00:48:47,152
- I’ll see you guys later.
- Copy that.

517
00:48:49,302 --> 00:48:52,305
So, this Rykov’s hiding
in Murmansk?

518
00:48:52,388 --> 00:48:55,892
No bullshit, I thought
this was an exercise.

519
00:48:55,975 --> 00:48:58,353
We’re flying civilian?

520
00:48:58,436 --> 00:49:00,036
Given the heightened tension
with Russia,

521
00:49:00,063 --> 00:49:01,689
it’s the cleanest plan.

522
00:49:01,773 --> 00:49:04,067
And we cannot leave a trace
of U.S. presence behind.

523
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:05,693
Understood?

524
00:49:05,777 --> 00:49:07,570
What’s our exfil?

525
00:49:09,072 --> 00:49:11,866
You should read
the mission brief.

526
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:13,868
Hey, Ritter,
you’re not joining us?

527
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:15,953
I’ll see you over there.

528
00:49:33,346 --> 00:49:35,098
Stop.

529
00:49:35,181 --> 00:49:36,516
Hmm?

530
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:38,184
Don’t do that, John.

531
00:49:38,267 --> 00:49:39,727
I’m serious.

532
00:49:39,811 --> 00:49:41,354
Mm. Okay.

533
00:49:41,437 --> 00:49:43,022
Okay.

534
00:49:43,106 --> 00:49:44,440
Okay, I’m sorry.

535
00:49:44,524 --> 00:49:45,733
I’m sorry. I’m sorry.

536
00:49:45,817 --> 00:49:47,819
Why are you such an asshole?

537
00:49:51,364 --> 00:49:54,575
"I don’t think Senior Chief
Kelly’s fit for the field."

538
00:49:55,952 --> 00:49:57,412
Hmm?

539
00:49:57,495 --> 00:49:59,288
What was that?

540
00:50:00,373 --> 00:50:02,291
You don’t trust me no more?

541
00:50:02,375 --> 00:50:06,379
Like I said,
you’re pretty messy right now.

542
00:50:16,264 --> 00:50:18,182
Before I put a bullet
in Vaseliev’s head,

543
00:50:18,266 --> 00:50:20,268
you know what he told me?

544
00:50:22,103 --> 00:50:24,522
That death follows me around.

545
00:50:26,774 --> 00:50:28,526
- He was right.
- John, he was...

546
00:50:28,609 --> 00:50:30,987
No, no, no, no,
just hear me out.

547
00:50:33,114 --> 00:50:36,784
If I hadn’t been
on that mission in Aleppo,

548
00:50:36,868 --> 00:50:40,121
if I would’ve pulled out
one tour earlier, my wife...

549
00:50:41,956 --> 00:50:45,960
...my kid, they’d still be here.

550
00:50:49,964 --> 00:50:51,924
My family.

551
00:50:53,843 --> 00:50:55,762
Don’t get much more death
around you than that.

552
00:50:55,845 --> 00:50:57,472
- John.
- No, no.

553
00:50:57,555 --> 00:50:59,348
You’re not responsible
for any of that.

554
00:50:59,432 --> 00:51:00,975
But I am.

555
00:51:02,393 --> 00:51:04,395
It’s my family.

556
00:51:08,399 --> 00:51:10,359
I’m gonna make it right.

557
00:51:12,278 --> 00:51:15,573
After that,
my life doesn’t matter.

558
00:51:15,656 --> 00:51:17,241
This isn’t a revenge mission.

559
00:51:17,325 --> 00:51:19,327
This is an extraction.

560
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:24,540
We are going to
bring him to justice.

561
00:51:24,624 --> 00:51:27,251
Tell me that’s gonna
be enough for you.

562
00:51:30,463 --> 00:51:34,926
I’m done making promises
that I can’t keep.

563
00:51:44,477 --> 00:51:46,038
This is the captain.

564
00:51:46,062 --> 00:51:47,855
30 minutes to HALO jump.

565
00:51:47,939 --> 00:51:49,690
Prepare for drop.

566
00:51:50,858 --> 00:51:52,693
Let’s go, boys.

567
00:51:53,694 --> 00:51:55,905
What’d you dream about?

568
00:51:55,988 --> 00:51:57,657
You.

569
00:52:05,331 --> 00:52:07,250
Check your equipment!

570
00:52:09,544 --> 00:52:11,128
Two minutes to drop, fellas.

571
00:52:11,212 --> 00:52:13,005
Stand by. Stand by.

572
00:52:18,594 --> 00:52:20,572
This is Russian Air Force,

573
00:52:20,596 --> 00:52:22,557
armed, S-U-five-seven.

574
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:24,058
You have been intercepted.

575
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:25,768
- Acknowledge.
- Abort, abort!

576
00:52:25,852 --> 00:52:27,228
Abort! Abort the jump!

577
00:52:27,311 --> 00:52:28,747
This is Transatlantic 104.

578
00:52:28,771 --> 00:52:30,606
We are en route
from Leipzig/Halle

579
00:52:30,690 --> 00:52:32,149
to Anchorage with clearance.

580
00:52:32,233 --> 00:52:33,568
Divert immediately

581
00:52:33,651 --> 00:52:35,027
to Murmansk Airdrome, ULM.

582
00:52:35,111 --> 00:52:37,047
Stay low, stay low,
st-stay low, stay low, stay low!

583
00:52:37,071 --> 00:52:38,531
He got a good look inside.

584
00:52:38,614 --> 00:52:40,374
If you do not, your intentions

585
00:52:40,449 --> 00:52:42,369
will be considered hostile
to Russian Federation.

586
00:52:42,451 --> 00:52:44,245
You will be shot down.

587
00:52:44,328 --> 00:52:46,247
This is Transatlantic 104.

588
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:47,957
You are garbled and unreadable.

589
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:49,375
Can you repeat?

590
00:52:53,087 --> 00:52:54,231
Missile launch. Missile launch.

591
00:52:54,255 --> 00:52:55,631
Right, two o’clock.

592
00:52:55,715 --> 00:52:57,395
Evasive maneuvers!
Evasive maneuvers!

593
00:52:59,302 --> 00:53:00,553
Brace, brace, brace!

594
00:53:06,058 --> 00:53:07,268
Brace!

595
00:53:12,648 --> 00:53:14,191
Can you put her down?

596
00:53:14,275 --> 00:53:15,860
We’re going for a swim.

597
00:53:15,943 --> 00:53:18,613
Get back and take a seat
and brace for hard impact.

598
00:53:22,450 --> 00:53:24,201
Sit down! Sit down!

599
00:53:24,285 --> 00:53:26,203
Strap in! Brace for impact!

600
00:53:55,691 --> 00:53:57,568
Is everybody good?!

601
00:53:57,652 --> 00:53:59,212
- We’re good.
- We’re good!

602
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:01,214
- Go! Move! I got it!
- We got to move now!

603
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:02,633
- Everybody, get out!
- Let’s go!

604
00:54:02,657 --> 00:54:04,009
- Evacuate now!
- No, I got to get...

605
00:54:04,033 --> 00:54:06,035
I got to get the gear.
We got to get the rest.

606
00:54:06,118 --> 00:54:07,787
Go! Leave it! Leave it!

607
00:54:07,870 --> 00:54:09,389
- Let’s go, boys!
- Come on!

608
00:54:09,413 --> 00:54:10,831
There’s no mission
without the gear!

609
00:54:10,915 --> 00:54:12,684
- Come on, let’s go!
- There’s no mission...

610
00:54:12,708 --> 00:54:15,711
Get out. Get out.

611
00:54:15,795 --> 00:54:17,505
I got to get the gear.

612
00:54:17,588 --> 00:54:19,966
We got to move!

613
00:54:26,305 --> 00:54:28,182
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

614
00:54:34,772 --> 00:54:36,565
Where you going?
Where you going?

615
00:54:36,649 --> 00:54:38,359
I got to get the gear.

616
00:54:38,442 --> 00:54:40,569
You can’t go back there.

617
00:54:40,653 --> 00:54:42,446
I got to get the Zodiac.

618
00:54:42,530 --> 00:54:44,115
Kelly!

619
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:17,685
John! John!

620
00:57:17,768 --> 00:57:19,728
Get him up to the surface!

621
00:57:19,812 --> 00:57:21,206
All right, we got you.

622
00:57:21,230 --> 00:57:22,499
We got you, we got you,
we got you.

623
00:57:22,523 --> 00:57:23,563
- Grab the gear.
- Come on.

624
00:57:23,607 --> 00:57:24,817
- Come on.
- Grab the gear.

625
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:27,361
We got the Zodiac.
Hold on to it.

626
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:28,904
Come on. Come on.

627
00:57:28,988 --> 00:57:30,030
Come on, you did it.

628
00:57:30,114 --> 00:57:32,825
You did it, homey.
You did it. Come on.

629
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:41,936
Hey, they’re pulling us out,
right?

630
00:58:42,019 --> 00:58:44,813
Not until the mission’s over.

631
00:58:44,897 --> 00:58:48,609
Well, I figured, since we just
exploded in the sky...

632
00:58:49,652 --> 00:58:51,737
Bet everyone thinks we’re dead.

633
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:54,657
Well, that’s the one thing
we got going for us.

634
00:58:56,659 --> 00:58:59,203
Ricardo.

635
00:58:59,286 --> 00:59:01,205
That’s my real name.

636
00:59:01,288 --> 00:59:03,999
If we’re gonna die together,

637
00:59:04,083 --> 00:59:06,585
may as well drop
the code names, right?

638
00:59:07,795 --> 00:59:09,797
Franklin.

639
00:59:11,173 --> 00:59:12,883
Seymour.

640
00:59:12,967 --> 00:59:14,635
Hey, don’t say shit, all right?

641
00:59:20,099 --> 00:59:21,934
Karen.

642
00:59:23,936 --> 00:59:25,980
John.

643
00:59:28,023 --> 00:59:30,317
Isn’t this nice?

644
00:59:31,819 --> 00:59:34,613
Mm. Still not adding up.

645
00:59:34,697 --> 00:59:37,199
What if us getting shot down
wasn’t an accident?

646
00:59:37,283 --> 00:59:39,159
It’s really hard to forget about

647
00:59:39,243 --> 00:59:41,245
that last mission
we went on with Ritter.

648
00:59:41,328 --> 00:59:43,580
You were in the briefing.
You heard what they said.

649
00:59:43,664 --> 00:59:45,791
Ritter was the one
who said Rykov was dead.

650
00:59:45,874 --> 00:59:48,419
He was also the one
who stopped the investigation

651
00:59:48,502 --> 00:59:51,422
into my wife’s murder.
Isn’t that right?

652
00:59:51,505 --> 00:59:53,340
So now he’s the only asshole,

653
00:59:53,424 --> 00:59:55,050
the only one
that wasn’t on the plane.

654
00:59:55,134 --> 00:59:56,677
Give me a reason.

655
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:59,471
What reason would he possibly
have to sack the mission?

656
00:59:59,555 --> 01:00:00,931
Don’t know.

657
01:00:01,015 --> 01:00:05,019
But either way,
I’m going to get some answers.

658
01:00:06,312 --> 01:00:08,731
You tracking me?

659
01:00:09,982 --> 01:00:12,609
According to
senior Kremlin officials,

660
01:00:12,693 --> 01:00:16,322
the Airbus was not a
Transatlantic Airlines flight...

661
01:00:16,405 --> 01:00:18,407
But a spy aircraft
operated by the American CIA.

662
01:00:18,490 --> 01:00:20,492
One official stated
that the fake manifest...

663
01:00:20,576 --> 01:00:22,453
Hey, turn around.
Slowly! Slowly!

664
01:00:22,536 --> 01:00:23,829
Hands up. Hands up.

665
01:00:23,912 --> 01:00:24,913
I’ll stitch you up.

666
01:00:24,997 --> 01:00:26,040
- Search it.
- Sit down.

667
01:00:26,123 --> 01:00:28,500
- Sit down. Sit down. Down.
- Search it.

668
01:00:28,584 --> 01:00:30,127
What’s happening here, Greer?

669
01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:31,879
Quiet!

670
01:00:33,922 --> 01:00:36,467
- What’s the money for, Ritter?
- Listen, why don’t we just

671
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:37,861
put the guns down
and we can talk about

672
01:00:37,885 --> 01:00:39,112
what the hell is going on here!

673
01:00:39,136 --> 01:00:40,530
Why don’t you tell us
what our real mission is?

674
01:00:40,554 --> 01:00:41,740
You know what
my mission is, man.

675
01:00:41,764 --> 01:00:43,140
Now, why weren’t you
on the plane?

676
01:00:43,223 --> 01:00:44,683
How did they know
where to find us?

677
01:00:44,767 --> 01:00:46,560
- Russian airspace...
- Bullshit!

678
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:48,121
Same thing happened in Aleppo.

679
01:00:48,145 --> 01:00:50,481
What’s the real mission?

680
01:00:50,564 --> 01:00:53,192
Talk.

681
01:00:53,275 --> 01:00:55,402
I’m trying to get Rykov!

682
01:00:56,904 --> 01:00:58,781
Ask him. Ask him.

683
01:00:58,864 --> 01:01:00,741
Speak.

684
01:01:01,950 --> 01:01:03,577
He offer us money

685
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:06,038
to help capture target
in apartment building,

686
01:01:06,121 --> 01:01:07,831
get him to U.S. base in Finland.

687
01:01:07,915 --> 01:01:10,292
We thought you were dead!
We had to finish.

688
01:01:10,376 --> 01:01:12,562
- The threat of more attacks is real.
- Stay down!

689
01:01:12,586 --> 01:01:14,546
We need to get Rykov.

690
01:01:14,630 --> 01:01:16,006
We said no,
we cannot help, okay?

691
01:01:16,090 --> 01:01:18,759
We’re advance only.
We have families.

692
01:01:19,802 --> 01:01:21,804
He’s telling the truth!

693
01:01:23,055 --> 01:01:25,265
You want Rykov?
I can get you to him.

694
01:01:25,349 --> 01:01:27,285
That’s what you want, isn’t it?

695
01:01:27,309 --> 01:01:29,311
Easy! Easy!

696
01:01:29,395 --> 01:01:31,355
Get right here.
You think it’s a game?!

697
01:01:31,438 --> 01:01:32,856
Huh?

698
01:01:35,859 --> 01:01:37,194
Hmm?

699
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:43,826
I didn’t sell you out.

700
01:02:09,059 --> 01:02:11,353
You’re out of your goddamn mind!

701
01:02:59,860 --> 01:03:01,904
Home sweet home.

702
01:03:03,405 --> 01:03:05,240
Target is in the kitchen.

703
01:03:05,324 --> 01:03:07,075
He’s sitting at a table
drinking.

704
01:03:07,159 --> 01:03:09,039
- Is he alone?
- Two bodyguards.

705
01:03:34,937 --> 01:03:36,939
I’m just looking.

706
01:04:19,940 --> 01:04:22,401
Hold on, hold on, hold on,
hold on, hold on, hold on.

707
01:04:26,655 --> 01:04:28,865
John, what do you see?

708
01:04:38,208 --> 01:04:39,209
Damn it, John!

709
01:04:39,293 --> 01:04:41,128
Damn it, John, open the door.

710
01:04:41,211 --> 01:04:42,212
Open the door.

711
01:04:42,296 --> 01:04:44,423
John.

712
01:04:44,506 --> 01:04:46,717
- Get the fucking door open.
- Get the crowbar.

713
01:05:00,314 --> 01:05:03,400
John Kelly.

714
01:05:03,483 --> 01:05:05,652
Good to see you again.

715
01:05:08,363 --> 01:05:10,574
My wife’s name was Pam.

716
01:05:12,159 --> 01:05:14,995
And you’re gonna say it
before you die.

717
01:05:17,831 --> 01:05:19,833
I didn’t kill your wife.

718
01:05:21,126 --> 01:05:22,961
A decision did.

719
01:05:25,088 --> 01:05:27,007
Pawns, John, both of us.

720
01:05:27,090 --> 01:05:31,595
We’re just pawns
serving the same king.

721
01:05:34,890 --> 01:05:37,517
Do you know
I’m in the CIA, John?

722
01:05:37,601 --> 01:05:39,436
Did they tell you that?

723
01:05:41,688 --> 01:05:43,690
We wanted you here.

724
01:05:45,567 --> 01:05:47,736
You or anyone like you.

725
01:05:52,658 --> 01:05:54,701
What did they tell you,
that you were here

726
01:05:54,785 --> 01:05:57,245
to prevent an upcoming attack?

727
01:05:59,581 --> 01:06:01,917
There are no other ops, John.

728
01:06:03,502 --> 01:06:06,129
You and me being here...

729
01:06:06,213 --> 01:06:08,423
is the op.

730
01:06:23,063 --> 01:06:25,482
We fancy ourselves
true patriots.

731
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:31,863
We accept the possibility
of our death.

732
01:06:36,284 --> 01:06:38,704
Both of us.

733
01:06:47,546 --> 01:06:51,758
Our lives offered willingly
for the highest cause.

734
01:06:52,801 --> 01:06:54,177
Yeah?

735
01:06:54,261 --> 01:06:55,762
What cause is that?

736
01:06:55,846 --> 01:06:58,098
America, John.

737
01:07:02,561 --> 01:07:04,563
All we have to do is die.

738
01:07:04,646 --> 01:07:05,897
No, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait.

739
01:07:05,981 --> 01:07:07,821
Let-let’s just...
let’s just talk about things.

740
01:07:07,899 --> 01:07:10,277
Let’s just talk for
a little bit longer, okay?

741
01:07:14,406 --> 01:07:18,160
Those behind us in Washington...

742
01:07:18,243 --> 01:07:20,829
are not the only true patriots.

743
01:07:42,768 --> 01:07:44,770
Everybody all right?

744
01:07:48,315 --> 01:07:50,233
Let’s go! Let’s get out!

745
01:07:53,528 --> 01:07:54,988
We have to move!

746
01:08:06,833 --> 01:08:09,503
He wanted us here.
He was waiting for us.

747
01:08:09,586 --> 01:08:11,129
Shit!

748
01:08:11,213 --> 01:08:12,339
Sniper!

749
01:08:18,512 --> 01:08:21,014
- Hey, Dallas is down!
- Dallas!

750
01:08:22,766 --> 01:08:25,977
- Who’s got eyes on it?
- Dallas is down!

751
01:08:26,061 --> 01:08:27,896
Where’s it coming from?

752
01:08:29,189 --> 01:08:30,333
Dallas, where are you hit?

753
01:08:30,357 --> 01:08:31,667
- Dallas is hit.
- In my stomach.

754
01:08:31,691 --> 01:08:32,943
Dallas, can you move?

755
01:08:33,026 --> 01:08:34,694
I can’t.

756
01:08:34,778 --> 01:08:36,780
Talk to me, Dallas.
You’re all right, man.

757
01:08:36,863 --> 01:08:38,365
We’re gonna get you
out of there.

758
01:08:38,448 --> 01:08:40,534
- Where is he at?
- Hey!

759
01:08:40,617 --> 01:08:42,702
Kelly, it’s from your six!

760
01:08:46,915 --> 01:08:49,876
I can’t see him!

761
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:52,045
Thunder, lay down some fire!

762
01:08:52,128 --> 01:08:54,381
Kelly, it’s from your six.

763
01:08:57,676 --> 01:08:59,177
Help me.

764
01:08:59,261 --> 01:09:01,638
Hey, hey,
I won’t leave you here.

765
01:09:01,721 --> 01:09:03,115
It’s not naptime.

766
01:09:03,139 --> 01:09:04,367
Cover me, cover me,
cover me, cover me.

767
01:09:04,391 --> 01:09:06,101
Move.

768
01:09:14,067 --> 01:09:16,361
Coming back to you.
Crossing, crossing, crossing!

769
01:09:21,491 --> 01:09:23,493
Dallas, hang in there, buddy!

770
01:09:33,086 --> 01:09:36,214
- Third floor, second window!
- Third floor, second window!

771
01:09:36,298 --> 01:09:39,843
- Lay down some cover!
- I’m pinned down! Cover fire!

772
01:09:44,472 --> 01:09:47,392
You’re covered! Get him!
Go, go, go!

773
01:09:49,102 --> 01:09:50,729
Come on.

774
01:09:50,812 --> 01:09:53,565
Second sniper!

775
01:09:56,443 --> 01:09:58,403
There’s a second sniper!

776
01:09:58,486 --> 01:09:59,905
12 o’clock!

777
01:10:10,457 --> 01:10:12,250
Get him out of there!

778
01:10:22,218 --> 01:10:23,720
Get me out of here!

779
01:10:28,975 --> 01:10:30,685
Goddamn it.

780
01:10:32,228 --> 01:10:33,772
Shit!

781
01:10:33,855 --> 01:10:34,981
Hey.

782
01:10:35,065 --> 01:10:37,067
Ritter, this in the brief?

783
01:10:38,652 --> 01:10:41,112
- We need an out.
- Thunder’s down!

784
01:10:41,196 --> 01:10:42,836
There’s a sniper
covering the entry point!

785
01:10:42,906 --> 01:10:44,491
We need to find another way!

786
01:10:44,574 --> 01:10:46,159
You still in the fight, Thunder?

787
01:10:46,242 --> 01:10:48,662
Still in the game, ma’am.
I got our six.

788
01:10:48,745 --> 01:10:50,163
All right.

789
01:10:52,874 --> 01:10:54,876
I’m screening the situation.

790
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:57,003
Hatchet, Kelly, cover me.

791
01:10:57,087 --> 01:10:58,296
- Got you.
- Moving. - Moving.

792
01:10:58,380 --> 01:11:00,048
Covering fire!

793
01:11:05,804 --> 01:11:07,764
We got to frag that sniper.

794
01:11:09,683 --> 01:11:10,850
Cease fire.

795
01:11:10,934 --> 01:11:12,978
Cease fire.

796
01:11:36,376 --> 01:11:38,795
They just killed
two police officers.

797
01:11:43,216 --> 01:11:44,759
Shit.

798
01:11:44,843 --> 01:11:46,845
’Cause it looks like we did it.

799
01:11:53,101 --> 01:11:54,728
The dead Russians in my house.

800
01:11:56,062 --> 01:11:58,523
They wanted us to find ’em.

801
01:11:58,606 --> 01:12:00,366
They wanted us to find
a dead Russian soldier

802
01:12:00,442 --> 01:12:02,318
on American soil.

803
01:12:03,611 --> 01:12:05,822
And if we die here,
then they’ll find a bunch

804
01:12:05,905 --> 01:12:08,742
of dead American soldiers
on Russian soil, too.

805
01:12:09,826 --> 01:12:11,578
And if we kill a couple cops

806
01:12:11,661 --> 01:12:13,788
on the way out of here,
even better.

807
01:12:13,872 --> 01:12:15,248
Jesus.

808
01:12:17,584 --> 01:12:19,502
Everything...

809
01:12:19,586 --> 01:12:22,213
the assassination of the team,

810
01:12:22,297 --> 01:12:25,341
my house, this op...

811
01:12:25,425 --> 01:12:27,427
it was a setup
from the beginning.

812
01:12:29,971 --> 01:12:32,515
They’re trying to start a war.

813
01:12:40,148 --> 01:12:41,983
Like Rykov said,

814
01:12:42,067 --> 01:12:44,277
now all we got to do is die.

815
01:12:46,780 --> 01:12:49,407
Yeah, we’re not gonna do that.

816
01:12:49,491 --> 01:12:51,076
All right.

817
01:12:51,159 --> 01:12:53,078
We got to take out
this sniper in the hallway.

818
01:12:53,161 --> 01:12:54,788
I need you to buy us an exit.

819
01:12:54,871 --> 01:12:56,331
Tracking.

820
01:12:58,333 --> 01:13:00,126
- Moving.
- Thunder, pass me your pack.

821
01:13:06,883 --> 01:13:08,802
- Moving!
- Laying down cover!

822
01:13:18,436 --> 01:13:19,663
Stay in it. Stay in it, fellas.

823
01:13:19,687 --> 01:13:21,272
All right.

824
01:13:21,356 --> 01:13:23,108
I got him. I got him.

825
01:13:24,109 --> 01:13:25,652
All clear!

826
01:13:31,574 --> 01:13:33,701
All right.
Let’s move. Let’s move.

827
01:13:56,391 --> 01:13:58,768
Hold tight!
We’re making a way!

828
01:13:58,852 --> 01:14:00,854
Push, push, push!

829
01:15:09,005 --> 01:15:10,381
My gun jammed.

830
01:15:11,424 --> 01:15:13,051
Nice.

831
01:15:23,019 --> 01:15:24,979
All right.

832
01:15:27,398 --> 01:15:28,775
Time to go!

833
01:15:28,858 --> 01:15:30,443
Time to go,
time to go, time to go!

834
01:15:30,526 --> 01:15:31,694
Get out of here! Go!

835
01:15:31,778 --> 01:15:33,738
All right, come here.

836
01:15:33,821 --> 01:15:35,156
Almost there.

837
01:15:35,240 --> 01:15:36,324
Last man!

838
01:15:36,407 --> 01:15:38,701
Lobby, lobby, lobby!

839
01:15:38,785 --> 01:15:40,828
- Come on!
- Dallas, let’s go.

840
01:15:42,121 --> 01:15:43,706
Yeah, you almost there.

841
01:15:47,168 --> 01:15:48,795
To the right.

842
01:15:50,421 --> 01:15:52,674
Set him down, set him down,
set him down.

843
01:15:52,757 --> 01:15:53,967
Cover the exits!

844
01:15:56,761 --> 01:15:58,638
Watch my six.

845
01:15:58,721 --> 01:16:00,181
All right, man.

846
01:16:05,812 --> 01:16:07,563
All right.

847
01:16:11,693 --> 01:16:14,279
Hey, man.

848
01:16:14,362 --> 01:16:16,281
You got kids?

849
01:16:19,450 --> 01:16:21,286
What?

850
01:16:23,037 --> 01:16:24,706
Kids.

851
01:16:31,879 --> 01:16:35,591
Yeah. Yeah.

852
01:16:35,675 --> 01:16:38,052
Anything you want me
to tell ’em?

853
01:16:40,305 --> 01:16:42,307
Tell ’em, um,

854
01:16:42,390 --> 01:16:45,059
I love them.

855
01:16:45,143 --> 01:16:46,978
Sure.

856
01:16:49,272 --> 01:16:51,274
Tell ’em...

857
01:16:52,525 --> 01:16:54,277
Tell ’em...

858
01:17:20,970 --> 01:17:22,972
I got a plan.

859
01:17:24,891 --> 01:17:27,894
I’m gonna get up to the roof
and clear a path for you guys.

860
01:17:31,147 --> 01:17:34,484
We’re not leaving you behind.

861
01:17:34,567 --> 01:17:37,195
We can’t leave anybody behind.

862
01:17:39,197 --> 01:17:42,241
If we leave a trace,
they’re going to get their war.

863
01:17:42,325 --> 01:17:44,452
You got to get the team
out of here.

864
01:17:46,079 --> 01:17:47,705
To them, I’m not a soldier.

865
01:17:50,583 --> 01:17:52,919
I’m a felon.

866
01:17:53,002 --> 01:17:55,004
I can die here.

867
01:17:57,757 --> 01:17:59,425
Tracking?

868
01:18:09,268 --> 01:18:11,020
Hmm?

869
01:20:17,855 --> 01:20:20,566
Keep moving. Keep moving.

870
01:20:21,859 --> 01:20:23,069
Come on, Kelly.

871
01:23:08,067 --> 01:23:09,694
Come on, baby.

872
01:25:18,489 --> 01:25:20,533
Come on.

873
01:25:20,616 --> 01:25:22,618
Can you walk? Can you walk?

874
01:25:35,589 --> 01:25:37,591
The others went ahead.

875
01:26:36,233 --> 01:26:38,277
You guys heard
what Rykov said, right?

876
01:26:41,780 --> 01:26:44,074
He said it started in D.C.

877
01:26:46,201 --> 01:26:48,829
I thought I was
a pawn hunting a king.

878
01:26:52,750 --> 01:26:54,960
Rykov wasn’t a king.

879
01:26:55,044 --> 01:26:57,129
He was just me
on the other side.

880
01:26:59,131 --> 01:27:01,133
Pawns could never kill a king.

881
01:27:04,845 --> 01:27:07,306
All I’ve got
to go back to is jail.

882
01:27:20,152 --> 01:27:23,656
There’s a duffel bag of money
below deck.

883
01:27:25,658 --> 01:27:27,493
It’s yours.

884
01:27:30,454 --> 01:27:33,040
But you never made it out alive.

885
01:27:33,123 --> 01:27:35,334
You died in Murmansk.

886
01:27:38,879 --> 01:27:41,340
With you as a ghost,

887
01:27:41,423 --> 01:27:43,884
maybe we can find out
who’s behind this.

888
01:27:52,267 --> 01:27:54,561
I was wrong about you.

889
01:28:03,696 --> 01:28:05,632
...minister has accused the U.S.

890
01:28:05,656 --> 01:28:08,575
of an attack on a civilian
building in Murmansk

891
01:28:08,659 --> 01:28:10,744
which resulted
in multiple casualties.

892
01:28:10,828 --> 01:28:13,622
The White House denies
any connection.

893
01:28:13,706 --> 01:28:16,291
In response,
the U.S. has accused Russia

894
01:28:16,375 --> 01:28:18,919
of trying to shift blame
for the downed commercial flight

895
01:28:19,003 --> 01:28:20,671
over the Barents Sea.

896
01:28:20,754 --> 01:28:23,048
Each country has yet
to prove its claims,

897
01:28:23,132 --> 01:28:24,800
but the fact remains

898
01:28:24,883 --> 01:28:26,802
relations between
the two nations

899
01:28:26,885 --> 01:28:30,514
haven’t been this strained
since the Cold War.

900
01:28:30,597 --> 01:28:32,474
There are also concerns about

901
01:28:32,558 --> 01:28:35,561
how an escalation in tensions
could affect the economy.

902
01:28:35,644 --> 01:28:38,063
A U.S. trade representative
has stated that...

903
01:28:48,824 --> 01:28:50,826
Mr. Secretary.

904
01:28:52,036 --> 01:28:54,038
John.

905
01:28:56,206 --> 01:28:58,208
Greer told me you were dead.

906
01:28:58,292 --> 01:29:00,252
I’m sorry to sneak up
on you like this,

907
01:29:00,335 --> 01:29:02,421
but I had to go ghost.

908
01:29:02,504 --> 01:29:05,049
It was the only way I could
get you that information.

909
01:29:05,132 --> 01:29:07,551
Wh-What information?

910
01:29:07,634 --> 01:29:10,220
About the mission.

911
01:29:10,304 --> 01:29:12,848
We weren’t supposed to
make it out of there alive.

912
01:29:12,931 --> 01:29:14,683
Sir, this was a CIA op.

913
01:29:14,767 --> 01:29:16,518
They ran it out of D.C.
the entire time.

914
01:29:16,602 --> 01:29:18,402
They’re trying to heat up
tension with Russia.

915
01:29:23,275 --> 01:29:25,277
You’re not suggesting Dillard?

916
01:29:28,614 --> 01:29:29,948
I’ve known Sarah for years.

917
01:29:30,032 --> 01:29:31,825
I don’t always agree
with her methods,

918
01:29:31,909 --> 01:29:34,536
but she’s nothing
if not a patriot.

919
01:29:34,620 --> 01:29:36,830
I know she doesn’t seem
like the type of person

920
01:29:36,914 --> 01:29:38,683
that would put an operative
in an explosive vest,

921
01:29:38,707 --> 01:29:39,833
have him blow himself up.

922
01:29:39,917 --> 01:29:42,377
Well, that’s exactly my point.

923
01:29:42,461 --> 01:29:45,923
Thing is, Greer left
that part out of the report.

924
01:29:46,965 --> 01:29:49,551
And when I said that
just now, you...

925
01:29:49,635 --> 01:29:51,553
you didn’t seem a bit surprised.

926
01:29:55,933 --> 01:29:58,727
Well, nothing surprises me
anymore, John.

927
01:30:19,706 --> 01:30:21,458
There he goes.

928
01:30:24,962 --> 01:30:26,882
I don’t know what you think
you’re doing, sailor.

929
01:30:28,799 --> 01:30:30,759
Helpless, huh?

930
01:30:32,594 --> 01:30:35,514
You sent me all over this world,

931
01:30:35,597 --> 01:30:38,725
put my life on the line
because I believed that we were

932
01:30:38,809 --> 01:30:40,811
on the right side of things.

933
01:30:40,894 --> 01:30:43,647
That our way would keep
people like you in check.

934
01:30:43,730 --> 01:30:45,274
Pull over, John.

935
01:30:45,357 --> 01:30:48,193
- You’re confused.
- So you’re gonna tell me why.

936
01:30:50,696 --> 01:30:52,656
Why my family?

937
01:30:52,739 --> 01:30:54,032
My wife?

938
01:30:54,116 --> 01:30:55,951
My daughter?

939
01:30:56,034 --> 01:30:58,036
Why kill my team?

940
01:30:59,705 --> 01:31:02,249
Rykov was all in,

941
01:31:02,332 --> 01:31:04,835
so I’d like a little bit
of what you sold him.

942
01:31:04,918 --> 01:31:06,545
You are making a mistake.

943
01:31:06,628 --> 01:31:08,380
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

944
01:31:08,463 --> 01:31:10,424
Know where we driving?

945
01:31:12,509 --> 01:31:15,095
You got a farm
out in West Virginia, right?

946
01:31:17,556 --> 01:31:19,808
Your daughter should be
home from college.

947
01:31:21,310 --> 01:31:23,312
Wesleyan.
That’s a good school.

948
01:31:24,771 --> 01:31:26,356
Your wife.

949
01:31:26,440 --> 01:31:28,984
Your son, too.

950
01:31:29,067 --> 01:31:31,945
So I suggest you start talking.

951
01:31:32,029 --> 01:31:33,780
Because if you don’t,

952
01:31:33,864 --> 01:31:37,701
I’m gonna make you watch me kill
your whole damn family.

953
01:31:37,784 --> 01:31:40,871
I never met Rykov in my life.

954
01:31:40,954 --> 01:31:43,040
I’m listening.

955
01:31:49,713 --> 01:31:51,798
You know who won World War II?

956
01:31:53,634 --> 01:31:56,178
It wasn’t the generals
or the admirals.

957
01:31:56,261 --> 01:31:58,597
It was the economists.

958
01:31:58,680 --> 01:32:01,767
More tanks, planes, ships.

959
01:32:01,850 --> 01:32:03,894
And all that spending lifted

960
01:32:03,977 --> 01:32:05,896
this entire nation
out of poverty.

961
01:32:05,979 --> 01:32:09,107
Freed the world from tyranny.

962
01:32:09,191 --> 01:32:13,028
A big country needs big enemies.

963
01:32:13,111 --> 01:32:16,573
The best enemy we ever had
was the Soviet Union.

964
01:32:16,657 --> 01:32:21,411
Our fear of them
unified our people.

965
01:32:21,495 --> 01:32:23,413
Gave us purpose.

966
01:32:24,665 --> 01:32:26,625
The problem today, John,

967
01:32:26,708 --> 01:32:29,461
is half this country thinks
the other half is its enemy

968
01:32:29,544 --> 01:32:31,713
because they have
no one else to fight.

969
01:32:33,131 --> 01:32:34,883
So...

970
01:32:34,967 --> 01:32:37,886
we gave them a real enemy.

971
01:32:37,970 --> 01:32:40,555
One with the power
to threaten their lives,

972
01:32:40,639 --> 01:32:42,474
their freedoms.

973
01:32:42,557 --> 01:32:45,060
Freedoms you take for granted.

974
01:32:46,561 --> 01:32:49,147
And it works, John.
It works.

975
01:32:50,941 --> 01:32:53,151
You just wouldn’t die.

976
01:32:54,194 --> 01:32:58,991
You had no right
to take so much from us.

977
01:32:59,074 --> 01:33:02,077
No, I did. I swore an oath.

978
01:33:04,371 --> 01:33:06,873
Me, too.

979
01:33:06,957 --> 01:33:08,792
To my wife.

980
01:33:10,002 --> 01:33:12,921
Her name was Pam.

981
01:33:13,005 --> 01:33:16,383
And you’re gonna say it
before you die.

982
01:33:18,385 --> 01:33:19,886
Uh, what...

983
01:33:34,151 --> 01:33:36,069
You’re gonna say her name.

984
01:33:36,153 --> 01:33:38,196
Get me out of here!

985
01:33:38,280 --> 01:33:40,324
Say her name.

986
01:33:40,407 --> 01:33:41,825
Get me out of here!

987
01:33:47,331 --> 01:33:49,416
Say it!

988
01:33:49,499 --> 01:33:50,709
Pam!

989
01:33:53,170 --> 01:33:54,880
Pam!

990
01:34:00,677 --> 01:34:02,721
Pam!

991
01:34:05,057 --> 01:34:06,475
Pam...

992
01:35:11,498 --> 01:35:13,500
There is a heaven.

993
01:35:18,797 --> 01:35:21,007
Mm, is this it?

994
01:35:22,050 --> 01:35:24,678
No, baby, it’s not.

995
01:35:29,558 --> 01:35:31,852
What about you?

996
01:35:31,935 --> 01:35:34,187
Are you in heaven?

997
01:35:34,271 --> 01:35:36,064
I’m with you.

998
01:35:44,281 --> 01:35:46,283
Not always.

999
01:35:48,076 --> 01:35:50,537
No, not always.

1000
01:35:50,620 --> 01:35:52,414
But now.

1001
01:35:59,045 --> 01:36:01,465
Pam, I miss you.

1002
01:36:01,548 --> 01:36:03,550
I know.

1003
01:36:05,427 --> 01:36:07,429
It’s okay.

1004
01:36:17,772 --> 01:36:20,817
"And lead us not
into temptation,

1005
01:36:20,901 --> 01:36:23,195
"but deliver us from evil.

1006
01:36:24,863 --> 01:36:27,616
"For thine is the kingdom

1007
01:36:27,699 --> 01:36:30,744
"and the power and the glory

1008
01:36:30,827 --> 01:36:33,663
"forever and ever.

1009
01:36:33,747 --> 01:36:35,582
Amen."

1010
01:37:10,033 --> 01:37:11,844
Although the precise nature

1011
01:37:11,868 --> 01:37:13,662
of the action
remains classified,

1012
01:37:13,745 --> 01:37:15,413
it apparently cost the life

1013
01:37:15,497 --> 01:37:17,541
of Secretary of Defense
Thomas Clay,

1014
01:37:17,624 --> 01:37:20,085
who was found dead
in the Potomac River last week

1015
01:37:20,168 --> 01:37:21,545
in an apparent suicide.

1016
01:37:21,628 --> 01:37:23,296
Emerging reports suggest

1017
01:37:23,380 --> 01:37:25,799
he was involved
in a potentially treason...

1018
01:37:25,882 --> 01:37:28,510
Hey. I was listening to that.

1019
01:37:33,682 --> 01:37:35,850
Lot less people than I thought.

1020
01:38:06,881 --> 01:38:10,135
We gave them a real enemy.

1021
01:38:10,218 --> 01:38:12,721
One with the power
to threaten their lives,

1022
01:38:12,804 --> 01:38:14,681
their freedoms.

1023
01:38:14,764 --> 01:38:16,766
Freedoms you take for granted.

1024
01:38:18,268 --> 01:38:20,854
And it works, John.
It works.

1025
01:38:23,064 --> 01:38:25,066
You just wouldn’t die.

1026
01:38:29,487 --> 01:38:31,489
I need a favor.

1027
01:38:46,713 --> 01:38:49,132
Vaseliev did say that
none of this would be over

1028
01:38:49,215 --> 01:38:51,635
until John Kelly was dead.

1029
01:38:55,347 --> 01:38:57,098
Here’s your new legend,

1030
01:38:57,182 --> 01:38:59,601
courtesy of
your little friend Ritter.

1031
01:39:02,771 --> 01:39:04,939
"John Clark."

1032
01:39:05,023 --> 01:39:06,941
That’s real creative.

1033
01:39:07,025 --> 01:39:10,028
Yeah, well, the CIA isn’t
exactly known for that.

1034
01:39:10,111 --> 01:39:12,030
That’s fair.

1035
01:39:13,907 --> 01:39:16,201
What are you gonna do, John?

1036
01:39:19,037 --> 01:39:22,624
Disappear.

1037
01:39:26,753 --> 01:39:29,130
And I know
you’re dead and all now,

1038
01:39:29,214 --> 01:39:31,466
but don’t be a stranger.

1039
01:39:31,549 --> 01:39:33,468
Yes, ma’am.

1040
01:41:51,606 --> 01:41:53,608
Director.

1041
01:41:54,943 --> 01:41:57,445
Congratulations on
the promotion, by the way.

1042
01:41:58,696 --> 01:42:00,532
Thank you.

1043
01:42:02,408 --> 01:42:06,663
Got to say I was surprised
when you, uh, came back to D.C.

1044
01:42:08,206 --> 01:42:10,542
I’ve been thinking
about what happened.

1045
01:42:12,168 --> 01:42:14,379
About how it could happen again.

1046
01:42:17,006 --> 01:42:19,092
So I put together some thoughts.

1047
01:42:20,677 --> 01:42:24,722
A multinational
counterterrorist team,

1048
01:42:24,806 --> 01:42:29,978
made up of U.S., U.K.,
hand-selected NATO personnel,

1049
01:42:30,061 --> 01:42:33,523
with the full support of their
national intelligence services.

1050
01:42:33,606 --> 01:42:36,693
And who’s gonna run
that kind of thing?

1051
01:42:36,776 --> 01:42:38,611
I will.

1052
01:42:40,321 --> 01:42:42,824
I want to present it
to the president.

1053
01:42:45,743 --> 01:42:47,954
Do you, now?

1054
01:42:57,964 --> 01:42:59,883
Calling it Rainbow.

1055
01:43:01,134 --> 01:43:03,011
Why is that?

1056
01:43:07,181 --> 01:43:09,183
It’s personal.

1057
01:43:15,064 --> 01:43:16,649
Hey, John.

1058
01:43:20,069 --> 01:43:22,071
It’s good to have you back.

1059
01:43:28,244 --> 01:43:30,246
It’s good to be back.
