mall, it belongs in a museum.

368
00:30:13,782 --> 00:30:17,217
Museum where
it'll make no profit.

369
00:30:17,284 --> 00:30:19,086
What's this?

370
00:30:19,153 --> 00:30:20,321
No.

371
00:30:20,387 --> 00:30:24,091
Aldo, as long as
we are fifty-fifty,

372
00:30:24,158 --> 00:30:25,426
that's how it stays.

373
00:30:25,492 --> 00:30:26,994
No malls.

374
00:30:29,196 --> 00:30:31,332
I see Maurizio got married.

375
00:30:31,398 --> 00:30:32,399
[Rodolfo] Oh, God!

376
00:30:32,466 --> 00:30:34,636
Some... Oh, she's...

377
00:30:34,703 --> 00:30:36,103
I can't even say her name.

378
00:30:37,304 --> 00:30:39,039
Well, sooner or later
you will have to.

379
00:30:39,106 --> 00:30:40,441
- No, no, no.
- Yes.

380
00:30:40,508 --> 00:30:42,242
No, Maurizio and I history.
History.

381
00:30:42,309 --> 00:30:43,944
- No, come on.
- I don't...

382
00:30:44,011 --> 00:30:45,647
You are old.

383
00:30:45,714 --> 00:30:50,384
Maurizio is your only son.
He is your true legacy.

384
00:30:50,451 --> 00:30:52,986
- You don't bring him back into the fold...
- Well, maybe...

385
00:30:53,053 --> 00:30:54,823
I'm telling you...

386
00:30:54,888 --> 00:30:58,225
you'll only wind up being
a bitter and lonely old man.

387
00:30:58,292 --> 00:31:00,060
That's what happens
to all of us.

388
00:31:00,127 --> 00:31:01,830
Time will tell. But...

389
00:31:01,895 --> 00:31:04,599
Yeah. When did you
last touch him, huh?

390
00:31:04,666 --> 00:31:06,133
When did you last hug him?

391
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,335
You don't touch anybody.

392
00:31:09,537 --> 00:31:11,405
You used to touch
every once in a while,

393
00:31:11,472 --> 00:31:13,575
now you, what,
touch yourself?

394
00:31:13,641 --> 00:31:16,110
- You? You, teaching me?
- That's correct.

395
00:31:16,176 --> 00:31:19,313
[stuttering] How's it going
with your boy? Hmm?

396
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:22,916
Well, your son is
a smart lawyer.

397
00:31:22,983 --> 00:31:24,151
Mine is an idiot.

398
00:31:24,218 --> 00:31:26,487
But he's my idiot.

399
00:31:26,554 --> 00:31:28,322
And I know
how to deal with him.

400
00:31:28,389 --> 00:31:31,191
But you need to deal
with your son.

401
00:31:31,258 --> 00:31:32,893
- Ah...
- Yes.

402
00:31:33,728 --> 00:31:35,496
It's my birthday on Sunday.

403
00:31:35,563 --> 00:31:36,930
Yeah?

404
00:31:36,997 --> 00:31:38,165
We'll all be there.

405
00:31:38,899 --> 00:31:40,334
You should come.

406
00:31:44,438 --> 00:31:46,173
I'll have to look at my diary.

407
00:31:47,575 --> 00:31:50,077
[telephone ringing]

408
00:31:54,348 --> 00:31:55,983
- Hello.
- [Aldo] <i>Hello.</i>

409
00:31:56,049 --> 00:31:57,652
Who is this?

410
00:31:57,719 --> 00:32:01,656
- Si, <i>this is Aldo. Aldo Gucci.</i>
- Aldo.

411
00:32:01,723 --> 00:32:04,057
<i>I hope I'm not interrupting
anything important.</i>

412
00:32:04,124 --> 00:32:05,459
What could be more important

413
00:32:05,527 --> 00:32:07,494
than a phone call
from my new uncle?

414
00:32:07,562 --> 00:32:13,000
I am truly sorry for not being
able to come to your wedding.

415
00:32:13,066 --> 00:32:14,803
It was... I couldn't help it.

416
00:32:14,869 --> 00:32:16,136
Business beckoned.

417
00:32:18,172 --> 00:32:20,073
Easy on that.

418
00:32:21,275 --> 00:32:23,143
I understand, of course.
I know how busy you are.

419
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:26,180
<i>We are celebrating my
birthday this weekend</i>

420
00:32:26,246 --> 00:32:27,816
<i>at my villa.</i>

421
00:32:27,882 --> 00:32:29,651
<i>And I think it would be</i>

422
00:32:29,717 --> 00:32:33,220
a perfect opportunity for you
to come and meet the family.

423
00:32:33,287 --> 00:32:34,823
What do you think?

424
00:32:34,889 --> 00:32:35,989
Your birthday,
I would love that.

425
00:32:36,056 --> 00:32:37,592
How many candles is it?

426
00:32:37,659 --> 00:32:39,594
<i>Seventy.</i>

427
00:32:39,661 --> 00:32:43,096
They say it's the new
sixty-nine.

428
00:32:43,163 --> 00:32:45,867
Well, I can't speak
for Maurizio.

429
00:32:45,934 --> 00:32:47,334
He's right here.

430
00:32:49,571 --> 00:32:50,538
[whispers] No.

431
00:32:50,605 --> 00:32:51,573
Please.

432
00:32:58,378 --> 00:32:59,614
<i>Ciao,</i> Aldo.

433
00:32:59,681 --> 00:33:00,782
<i>Maurizio!</i>

434
00:33:00,849 --> 00:33:03,250
How is my little lawyer?

435
00:33:03,317 --> 00:33:05,720
<i>I'm fine. I'm fine.</i>

436
00:33:05,787 --> 00:33:07,488
What are you doing this Sunday?

437
00:33:08,957 --> 00:33:10,625
I'll double check.

438
00:33:10,692 --> 00:33:12,594
Come to my birthday party.

439
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:14,762
I'm only in town
for a couple of weeks.

440
00:33:14,829 --> 00:33:16,029
<i>Come on.</i>

441
00:33:17,866 --> 00:33:19,366
Let me discuss it
with Patrizia.

442
00:33:19,433 --> 00:33:21,435
- Let's go! A little day trip.
- I don't...

443
00:33:21,503 --> 00:33:24,706
You know, your father and I
aren't getting any younger.

444
00:33:24,772 --> 00:33:27,474
These gatherings are becoming
more and more

445
00:33:27,542 --> 00:33:30,310
of a rare occurrence,
you know.

446
00:33:31,011 --> 00:33:32,379
Please.

447
00:33:34,716 --> 00:33:35,884
<i>Come on!</i>

448
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:37,719
I'll be jumping out of a cake.

[men grunting]

Come on.
Kick his teeth out.

452
00:34:04,044 --> 00:34:07,015
Come on! Come on!

453
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,584
Earn your fucking lunch!

454
00:34:10,552 --> 00:34:12,820
Kick his teeth out. Come on!

455
00:34:13,988 --> 00:34:15,657
Go, go, go!

456
00:34:15,723 --> 00:34:18,125
That's it. Go!

457
00:34:18,191 --> 00:34:21,461
Maurizio! Come on!
We're missing a player.

458
00:34:21,529 --> 00:34:24,032
- Oh. No, no, no.
- What no? Yes, yes. Come on.

459
00:34:24,097 --> 00:34:26,734
We're missing a player.
Come on!

460
00:34:26,801 --> 00:34:29,003
- Put it on. Take that jacket off.
- Okay.

461
00:34:29,069 --> 00:34:30,137
You know it.

462
00:34:30,203 --> 00:34:31,305
Paolo!

463
00:34:31,371 --> 00:34:33,073
Watch him. Watch him play.

464
00:34:33,741 --> 00:34:35,142
See that?

465
00:34:35,208 --> 00:34:38,012
Oh, my God. Look at that.

466
00:34:38,078 --> 00:34:40,113
[man] Maurizio! Maurizio!

467

[shouts]

468
00:34:42,182 --> 00:34:43,383
[Aldo] That's your husband!

Paolo!

471
00:34:57,932 --> 00:34:59,634

00:35:07,407 --> 00:35:08,676
How do you act shy?

<i>♪ Happy birthday, dear Aldo ♪</i>

476
00:35:11,746 --> 00:35:13,615
- Papa!
- "Papa." I love that.

478
00:35:15,415 --> 00:35:18,086
He's never in his life
called me Papa.

479
00:35:18,151 --> 00:35:20,622
Patrizia, you should know...

480
00:35:21,421 --> 00:35:23,357
that the Guccis

481
00:35:23,423 --> 00:35:27,194
were noble saddle-makers
to medieval courts.

482
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:32,332
We have history flowing through
these green and red webbings.

483
00:35:32,399 --> 00:35:35,503
And yes, we are expensive.

484
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:40,407
But quality is remembered
long after price is forgotten.

485
00:35:41,174 --> 00:35:43,044
Huh?

486
00:35:43,111 --> 00:35:45,412
Thoughts on Paolo's outfit,
Domenico?

487
00:35:45,479 --> 00:35:47,314
You're the fashionista.

488
00:35:47,982 --> 00:35:50,450
It's eccentric.

489
00:35:51,251 --> 00:35:53,554
I designed this myself.

490
00:35:53,621 --> 00:35:58,960
Well, you should reconsider
your wardrobe choices, Paolo.

491
00:35:59,027 --> 00:36:02,262
You are Gucci,
you need to dress the part.

492
00:36:02,329 --> 00:36:04,331
It's chic.

493
00:36:05,733 --> 00:36:08,936
My father's problem is that
he's stuck in the past.

494
00:36:09,003 --> 00:36:13,074
He refuses to take Gucci
into the next century.

495
00:36:13,141 --> 00:36:16,010
- [Aldo] Yes, Gucci is doing fine under my watch.
- [Paolo] No!

496
00:36:16,077 --> 00:36:17,578
- No, don't worry about it.
- Oh, no!

497
00:36:17,645 --> 00:36:19,781
No. No.

498
00:36:19,847 --> 00:36:21,448
It needs new ideas.

499
00:36:21,516 --> 00:36:23,250
- New energy.
- Of course.

500
00:36:23,316 --> 00:36:25,953
And I happen to be
bursting with creativity.

501
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:28,956
- Yes, yes.
- Yes, my bladder may be full...

502
00:36:30,058 --> 00:36:32,994
but my dreams are even fuller.

503
00:36:33,061 --> 00:36:35,863
I'm like a rush of water.

Please.

506
00:36:41,169 --> 00:36:43,638
[Paolo] You're always
brushing me off.

507
00:36:43,705 --> 00:36:47,975
I'm a designer.
I need to express myself.

508
00:36:48,042 --> 00:36:51,612
- But why all this sudden moaning?
- I have a...

509
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:56,416
- [Aldo] What do you want?
- [Paolo] Because, I'm so sick of you ignoring me.

510
00:36:56,483 --> 00:36:58,218
I am sick of your talking.

511
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:00,353
Sick of it.

512
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:02,690
You deliberately hurt
my feelings.

513
00:37:02,757 --> 00:37:04,625
- [Aldo] Yes.
- No, no, no.

514
00:37:04,692 --> 00:37:06,861
- Jenny! Jenny honey.
- No! That's what he wants.

515
00:37:06,928 --> 00:37:09,296
- Don't. Sit down. Sit down! Sit down.
- [Aldo] You have succeeded.

516
00:37:09,362 --> 00:37:10,865
I haven't had espresso.

517
00:37:10,932 --> 00:37:13,134
- [Aldo] Bye.
- Thanks for having us, Uncle.

518
00:37:13,201 --> 00:37:18,238
Ah! My nephew,
he has such great taste.

519
00:37:19,006 --> 00:37:21,843
Oh. A small wedding gift.

520
00:37:23,911 --> 00:37:25,213
Thank you.

521
00:37:25,278 --> 00:37:28,850
Come to New York. Okay?

522
00:37:30,218 --> 00:37:31,786
- <i>Ciao,</i> Aldo.
- <i>Ciao!</i>

- <i>Ciao.</i>
- [laughs]

[bidding farewell in Italian]

525
00:37:34,922 --> 00:37:36,389
Oh, it's good to see you.

526
00:37:36,456 --> 00:37:39,326
I couldn't believe
you got into the car.

527
00:37:39,392 --> 00:37:40,728
How did you do that?

528
00:37:43,064 --> 00:37:44,464
[Maurizio] It's all bullshit.

529
00:37:44,532 --> 00:37:45,800
We're not royalty.

530
00:37:47,001 --> 00:37:49,704
My grandfather Guccio was
a bellhop in London.

531
00:37:49,771 --> 00:37:53,107
That's where he got the idea
for leather goods.

532
00:37:53,174 --> 00:37:56,244
By carrying bags around
for rich aristocrats.

533
00:37:56,309 --> 00:37:57,745
Gucci is like that cake.

534
00:37:57,812 --> 00:37:59,647
What?

535
00:37:59,714 --> 00:38:02,750
Once you think there's enough
to go around...

536
00:38:04,085 --> 00:38:06,821
then you'll have a taste,
and then you'll want more...

537
00:38:06,888 --> 00:38:09,356
and then you'll want
the whole thing for yourself.

538
00:38:11,491 --> 00:38:12,827
What about you?

539
00:38:14,262 --> 00:38:17,330
You just gonna sit around
and watch them eat everything?

540
00:38:18,132 --> 00:38:19,734
Me? I am Gucci by name.

541
00:38:20,835 --> 00:38:24,272
I don't have
their Tuscan character.

542
00:38:24,337 --> 00:38:27,374
It was diluted by

That's what you are.

How did you sleep?

728

Like babies.

729
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:24,566

Thank you.

Well, that looks great on you.

Looks that good!

736

We're so surprised.

00:49:37,077 --> 00:49:39,246
Yeah, Patrizia is just
playing dress-up.

738
00:49:39,313 --> 00:49:43,083
Yeah. Well,
here's a little secret.

00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:46,186
Don't tell anybody. See?

Come here, Patrizia.

Anything you see is yours.

What does that even mean?

757

I don't know.
It means something.

758

You'll be my eyes and ears

759

You'll represent the company.

760

I know you are.

So svelte.

Your cheek bones
could cut a diamond.

Oh, please. To what do I owe
this unexpected pleasure?

788
00:52:25,113 --> 00:52:29,717
Well, I came
first and foremost...

789
00:52:29,784 --> 00:52:32,920
to say... Well...

790
00:52:33,921 --> 00:52:34,856

Maurizio and my father
have been spending

796
00:52:51,371 --> 00:52:53,074
a lot of time together
in New York.

797
00:52:53,141 --> 00:52:55,175
And I thought...

798
00:52:56,544 --> 00:52:58,846
maybe you and I
could do the same.

799
00:52:59,681 --> 00:53:01,415
Why would I...

800
00:53:01,481 --> 00:53:03,283
[Paolo] Well, to discuss...

801
00:53:04,118 --> 00:53:05,720
[Rodolfo] To discuss what?

802
00:53:05,787 --> 00:53:07,354
My ideas.

803
00:53:08,321 --> 00:53:10,692
- You have ideas?
- Boof.

804
00:53:10,758 --> 00:53:13,561
Does an elephant
shit in the jungle?

805
00:53:15,063 --> 00:53:17,965
I was born with a gift.

806
00:53:19,232 --> 00:53:20,768
I am an artist.

807
00:53:20,835 --> 00:53:23,336
My father,
he just won't see it.

808
00:53:24,605 --> 00:53:25,540
But...

809
00:53:26,808 --> 00:53:28,475
These are yours?

810
00:53:28,543 --> 00:53:31,445
How come the family doesn't
know you have a gift?

811
00:53:31,512 --> 00:53:33,614
Domenico, did you know
Paolo had a gift?

812
00:53:33,681 --> 00:53:35,750
I'm afraid I did not, sir.

814

These were inspired
by my trip to Cuba.

I call this collection...

819
00:53:53,201 --> 00:53:54,836
"Havana Libre."

820
00:53:58,206 --> 00:53:59,774
Lots of pastels.

821
00:53:59,841 --> 00:54:04,377
Rum inspired, sun-soaked
and lots of browns.

822
00:54:04,444 --> 00:54:10,450
You have pastels
and brown together.

You must not show these
to anyone.

Keep them hidden.

my ideas, right?

831

Oh, call me a lawyer.

832

Not you.

833
00:54:43,818 --> 00:54:46,453
Over the years, I have found...

834
00:54:47,955 --> 00:54:54,427
that true talent is often
unaware of its own brilliance.

835
00:54:54,494 --> 00:54:59,200
It must be cherished
and protected.

You have found one thing...

01:12:02,455 --> 01:12:03,858
You just asked me a question.

1090
01:12:05,026 --> 01:12:06,627
And what you really
want to know is

1091
01:12:06,694 --> 01:12:08,262
whether you can ask me
two questions,

1092
01:12:08,328 --> 01:12:09,297
one of which
you've already asked.

1093
01:12:09,362 --> 01:12:11,566
[laughing]

1094
01:12:11,632 --> 01:12:15,468
That's good.
Domenico, very funny.

1095
01:12:15,536 --> 01:12:17,505
Okay, here is
my second question.

1096
01:12:19,140 --> 01:12:24,512
What do you see as being
your purpose at Gucci?

1097
01:12:26,514 --> 01:12:27,815
Is this a job interview?

1098
01:12:28,316 --> 01:12:29,482
Maybe.

1099
01:12:31,018 --> 01:12:32,620
I'm a conservationist.

1100
01:12:34,222 --> 01:12:37,859
Gucci is a rare animal.
It must be protected.

1101
01:12:39,660 --> 01:12:40,828
Protected from who?

1102
01:12:41,829 --> 01:12:43,496
From whoever threatens it.

1103
01:12:45,465 --> 01:12:47,768
I find it very interesting that

1104
01:12:47,835 --> 01:12:50,137
you have such
a strong connection

1105
01:12:50,204 --> 01:12:52,640
to that which is not yours.

1106
01:12:54,075 --> 01:12:55,910
Uh...

1107
01:12:55,977 --> 01:12:58,679
Sometimes it takes an outsider
to see the truth.

1108
01:12:59,146 --> 01:13:00,081
<i>Bravo.</i>

1109
01:13:01,649 --> 01:13:05,920
Paolo, this one reminds me
of childhood.

1110
01:13:05,987 --> 01:13:09,957
Yeah, well, it's a memory
wrapped in lycra.

1111
01:13:10,024 --> 01:13:13,928
It's just so you.
It's exquisite.

1112
01:13:13,995 --> 01:13:15,263
Do you think so?

1113
01:13:15,329 --> 01:13:16,964
You have a gift,
I'm telling you.

1114
01:13:17,031 --> 01:13:18,431
Oh, well, stop.

1115
01:13:19,499 --> 01:13:21,135
Stop, you're going
to make me...

1116
01:13:21,202 --> 01:13:23,436
you're going to make me cry.

1117
01:13:24,538 --> 01:13:28,609
Nobody has ever
said that to me. Nobody.

1118
01:13:28,676 --> 01:13:31,045
Paolo, why don't you have
your own line?

1119
01:13:31,112 --> 01:13:34,148
These are just mock-ups.

1120
01:13:34,215 --> 01:13:36,817
I can't afford to get serious.

1121
01:13:36,884 --> 01:13:38,653
With your gift,
and your talent,

1122
01:13:38,719 --> 01:13:39,820
and your vision...

1123
01:13:39,887 --> 01:13:40,721
Are you kidding?

1124
01:13:40,788 --> 01:13:42,523
Gucci needs new blood.

1125
01:13:43,190 --> 01:13:44,792
Goodbye 1930s.

1126
01:13:45,559 --> 01:13:47,795
Hello, '80s. Huh?

1127
01:13:47,862 --> 01:13:51,632
Oh, you took the words
right out of my guts.

1128
01:13:51,699 --> 01:13:53,701
- Paolo Gucci is coming.
- [Paolo scatting]

1129
01:13:57,305 --> 01:13:59,974
Come on. [continues scatting]

1130
01:14:03,443 --> 01:14:04,578
[groans]

1131
01:14:05,246 --> 01:14:06,514
[sighs]

1132
01:14:10,284 --> 01:14:13,120
I'm disgusted by the way
your father treats you.

1133
01:14:14,322 --> 01:14:15,488
[sighs]

1134
01:14:16,590 --> 01:14:19,093
Leaving you behind
to groom Maurizio.

1135
01:14:19,994 --> 01:14:21,494
It's not right.

1136
01:14:21,562 --> 01:14:22,997
Who does he think he is?

1137
01:14:24,131 --> 01:14:27,868
Well, a dinosaur posing
as a butthole.

1138
01:14:27,935 --> 01:14:29,870
[chuckles]

1139
01:14:29,937 --> 01:14:31,839
[laughing]

1140
01:14:31,906 --> 01:14:33,975
You were a comedian
in a past life.

1141
01:14:35,643 --> 01:14:37,511
[Paolo wheezing]

1142
01:14:38,212 --> 01:14:39,613
Maurizio likes you.

1143
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:41,716
- [Paolo] Ah...
- He always has.

1144
01:14:41,782 --> 01:14:44,218
Well, I like my cousin too.

1145
01:14:44,285 --> 01:14:48,723
He's quiet like a...
like a little mouse.

1146
01:14:48,789 --> 01:14:50,858
Uh, tiny little mousy.

1147
01:14:50,925 --> 01:14:53,260
Doesn't scream like the others.

1148
01:14:53,327 --> 01:14:56,731
No, he doesn't. And you
and Maurizio together...

1149
01:14:56,797 --> 01:14:58,599
That would be amazing.

1150
01:14:58,666 --> 01:15:00,901
- That's a new chapter for Gucci.
- [Paolo] No, no, no.

1151
01:15:00,968 --> 01:15:03,738
My father,
he would never allow it.

1152
01:15:03,804 --> 01:15:07,541
He's got my little peaches
in a very tight grip.

1153
01:15:08,042 --> 01:15:09,110
Paolo...

1154
01:15:11,278 --> 01:15:12,680
maybe it's time...

1155
01:15:13,814 --> 01:15:15,516
to respectfully...

1156
01:15:17,284 --> 01:15:18,686
leave him behind.

1157
01:15:20,788 --> 01:15:22,523
You are justified.

1158
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:30,031
I do have...

1159
01:15:30,831 --> 01:15:33,000
something on my father.

1160
01:15:34,335 --> 01:15:37,938
Can you keep a secret?

1161
01:15:38,005 --> 01:15:40,708
Cross your heart
and hope to die.

1162
01:15:42,143 --> 01:15:45,646
Father, Son,
and House of Gucci.

1163
01:15:45,713 --> 01:15:46,981
[Paolo] Okay.

1164
01:15:48,616 --> 01:15:49,884
Okay.

1165
01:15:57,324 --> 01:15:59,126
Well, you know...

1166
01:15:59,193 --> 01:16:00,594
[Patrizia] You don't
have to tell me.

1167
01:16:00,661 --> 01:16:02,363
- Listen...
- It's just...

1168
01:16:02,430 --> 01:16:04,632
I can come back any time.
We can talk about your designs.

1169
01:16:05,866 --> 01:16:10,071
But what would I get
out of this?

1170
01:16:17,745 --> 01:16:20,214
We could offer you
an exclusive deal

1171
01:16:20,281 --> 01:16:22,683
to distribute your own line
under Gucci.

1172
01:16:23,784 --> 01:16:25,619
I should talk to Maurizio.

1173
01:16:31,225 --> 01:16:32,693
[Maurizio] <i>You talked to him?</i>

1174
01:16:33,194 --> 01:16:34,295
When?

1175
01:16:34,361 --> 01:16:35,296
[thunder rumbling]

1176
01:16:35,362 --> 01:16:36,831
Today.

1177
01:16:36,897 --> 01:16:38,699
He showed me his designs.

1178
01:16:39,500 --> 01:16:40,701
Why didn't you tell me?

1179
01:16:41,836 --> 01:16:43,671
[Patrizia] I'm telling you now,
aren't I?

1180
01:16:43,737 --> 01:16:45,507
[sputters] Patrizia,
that's not the point.

1181
01:16:45,574 --> 01:16:49,076
Don't focus on the process,
focus on the result.

1182
01:16:50,744 --> 01:16:52,680
I told him...

1183
01:16:52,746 --> 01:16:54,348
we'd distribute
his clothing line

1184
01:16:54,415 --> 01:16:57,084
under Gucci
and he committed to a deal.

1185
01:17:02,123 --> 01:17:04,758
Maurizio, those designs
won't see the light of day.

1186
01:17:04,825 --> 01:17:06,827
We need Paolo on our side.

1187
01:17:07,628 --> 01:17:09,230
What game are you playing?

1188
01:17:15,336 --> 01:17:17,338
I'm looking out
for our best interests.

1189
01:17:17,404 --> 01:17:18,439
Is that a game?

1190
01:17:18,507 --> 01:17:20,908
[rain pattering]

1191
01:17:24,879 --> 01:17:26,680

1192
01:17:33,654 --> 01:17:34,722
[beeps]

1193
01:17:34,788 --> 01:17:35,923
[Paolo exclaims]

1194
01:17:38,359 --> 01:17:39,760
Mau, Mau!

1195
01:17:39,827 --> 01:17:41,295
Thank you for coming.

1196
01:17:43,964 --> 01:17:45,733
You thought I lost my touch.

1197
01:17:45,799 --> 01:17:48,135
No, not yet.

1198
01:17:48,202 --> 01:17:49,904
[Maurizio] <i>Ciao,</i> Paolo.

1199
01:17:49,970 --> 01:17:50,804
You sounded urgent,
so I came right away.

1200
01:17:50,871 --> 01:17:52,006
Very well.

1201
01:18:04,018 --> 01:18:09,423
I got these from three
of his ex "secretaries."

1202
01:18:09,490 --> 01:18:12,259
He's not exactly
a favorite among the ex's.

1203
01:18:12,326 --> 01:18:15,296
In fact,
they all hate his guts.

1204
01:18:19,066 --> 01:18:25,339
Gucci is a very black hole
of undeclared income.

1205
01:18:26,140 --> 01:18:28,275
Paolo, this is fraud...

1206
01:18:28,342 --> 01:18:30,277
on a global scale.

1207
01:18:30,344 --> 01:18:33,714
In Italy taxes are okay,
but in America...

1208
01:18:34,448 --> 01:18:35,916
it is very different.

1209
01:18:36,984 --> 01:18:39,220
We should keep this
to ourselves.

1210
01:18:39,286 --> 01:18:42,323
[sputters] But we can use it...

1211
01:18:42,389 --> 01:18:46,093
as leverage
to persuade him a bit.

1212
01:18:46,860 --> 01:18:48,796
And with you...

1213
01:18:49,430 --> 01:18:50,565
on my side...

1214
01:18:50,632 --> 01:18:53,100
we have the majority we need

1215
01:18:53,167 --> 01:18:55,135
for you to become your own man.

1216
01:18:55,202 --> 01:18:59,106
And he won't get into
any real trouble, right?

1217
01:18:59,173 --> 01:19:02,142
No. [sputters] At this point...

1218
01:19:02,209 --> 01:19:04,945
worst case scenario,
he pays his taxes.

1219
01:19:05,012 --> 01:19:06,715
They slap his wrists.

1220
01:19:06,780 --> 01:19:08,249
Happens all the time.

1221
01:19:09,517 --> 01:19:11,885
But more importantly,
he would see you.

1222
01:19:13,555 --> 01:19:14,888
He would see you.

1223
01:19:16,423 --> 01:19:17,424
[sighs]

1224
01:19:18,425 --> 01:19:20,127

- I knew it was you.
- Oh, wow!

1448
01:34:25,666 --> 01:34:26,800
You look exactly the same.

1449

So do you.

1450

Until then,
you're coming with us.

1451
01:34:30,539 --> 01:34:31,872
- [Maurizio] I am not going.
- Because you said you were.

1452
01:34:31,939 --> 01:34:32,940
No. I always wanted to come.

1453

You said you would.

[Maurizio] Hey...

[chuckling]

1457
01:34:51,325 --> 01:34:52,960
[Patrizia] Hope
I'm not interrupting.

1458
01:34:53,027 --> 01:34:54,728
No, of course not.
You're not interrupting.

1459
01:34:56,230 --> 01:34:58,265
I see you've put up the tree.

1460
01:34:58,332 --> 01:34:59,800
[Maurizio] Yes. Yes.

1461
01:34:59,867 --> 01:35:02,236
Everybody, this is Patrizia.

1462
01:35:03,404 --> 01:35:06,073
- Hey, Patrizia.
- And this is Alessandra.

1463
01:35:07,542 --> 01:35:10,344
- Hello.
- Franco and Gianni, you know, of course.

1464
01:35:10,411 --> 01:35:11,912
This is my friend Paola...

1465
01:35:11,979 --> 01:35:14,649
and these are
all of her slaves.

1467
01:35:15,916 --> 01:35:17,051

1468
01:35:21,188 --> 01:35:22,156
Oh, sorry.

1469
01:35:24,825 --> 01:35:27,161
What do you think
of the macaroons?

1470
01:35:27,228 --> 01:35:30,464
This hazelnut one
is to die for.

1471
01:35:30,532 --> 01:35:33,767
Yeah. Where did you get 'em?

1472
01:35:33,834 --> 01:35:37,838
There is this charming little place
by Notre-Dame-de-Lorette in Paris.

1473
01:35:37,905 --> 01:35:41,942
"De-Lorette."
Notre-Dame-de-Lorette.

1474
01:35:42,009 --> 01:35:43,143
- Right.
- De-Lorette.

1475
01:35:44,579 --> 01:35:47,181
Maurizio and I stayed there
five years ago.

1476
01:35:48,048 --> 01:35:50,317
We had the most amazing time.

1477
01:35:50,384 --> 01:35:53,854
I begged Maurizio to take me
there for my 25th birthday.

1478
01:35:53,921 --> 01:35:57,024
And of course, he obliged.

1479
01:35:58,727 --> 01:36:00,995
As soon as we landed,
we went to the Jules Verne restaurant...

1480
01:36:01,061 --> 01:36:02,731
in the Eiffel Tower.

1481
01:36:02,796 --> 01:36:04,365
It's at the top.

1482
01:36:04,431 --> 01:36:06,400
No, no, no.
It's on the second floor.

1483
01:36:08,936 --> 01:36:10,938
It was magnificent.

1484
01:36:11,772 --> 01:36:13,407
Later we went to the Louvre.

1485
01:36:13,474 --> 01:36:15,677
I'd always dreamt
of seeing the Louvre.

1486
01:36:15,744 --> 01:36:18,445
We arranged for a private tour.
Thank God.

1487
01:36:18,513 --> 01:36:20,981
Imagine all those crowds.
I couldn't do it.

1488
01:36:21,048 --> 01:36:24,218
They just want to know where
you got the macaroons, sweetie.

1489
01:36:24,285 --> 01:36:25,853
I'm telling them.

1490
01:36:25,919 --> 01:36:28,055
Yeah, you're filling the story
full of unnecessary details.

1491
01:36:29,823 --> 01:36:31,526
[Patrizia] I don't think
our guests mind.

1492
01:36:31,593 --> 01:36:33,794
They wouldn't say if they did.

1493
01:36:35,630 --> 01:36:37,565
You're an unnecessary detail.

1494
01:36:39,400 --> 01:36:40,934
[laughing]

1495
01:36:45,906 --> 01:36:47,841
What I am trying
to tell you is...

1496
01:36:47,908 --> 01:36:51,979
De Sole is the only person who
saw the unsigned certificates.

1497
01:36:52,046 --> 01:36:55,883
He worked for my father for ten
years and he never questioned him.

1498
01:36:56,483 --> 01:36:57,985
I trust him.

1499
01:36:58,986 --> 01:37:00,954
He's not the problem.

1500
01:37:02,323 --> 01:37:04,058
I heard the way you spoke
to me at lunch.

1501
01:37:04,124 --> 01:37:05,727
He's not the problem?

1502
01:37:05,794 --> 01:37:07,194
[Maurizio] I was tired.

1503
01:37:09,531 --> 01:37:13,300
Next time, don't embarrass
me in front of those people.

1504
01:37:13,367 --> 01:37:15,537
Those people
are friends of mine.

1505
01:37:15,603 --> 01:37:18,339
I've known most of them
longer than you.

1506
01:37:19,273 --> 01:37:22,109
He is the problem. Say it!

1507
01:37:22,176 --> 01:37:25,446
Patrizia, I was tired.
I'm tired.

1508
01:37:25,513 --> 01:37:28,382
Then wake yourself up
and say it.

1509
01:37:28,449 --> 01:37:29,917
[Maurizio] Okay.

1510
01:37:29,983 --> 01:37:32,721
When you make me
sneak around my own family.

1511
01:37:32,787 --> 01:37:35,189
When you set father and son
against each other...

1512
01:37:35,255 --> 01:37:37,157
and me against Paolo.

1513
01:37:37,224 --> 01:37:40,461
When you second-guess a person
like Domenico De Sole...

1514
01:37:40,528 --> 01:37:43,497
the only person
my father trusted.

1515
01:37:43,565 --> 01:37:47,067
These things have an effect on the
environment I operate in. On me.

1516
01:37:48,570 --> 01:37:50,237
Actions have consequences.

1517
01:37:50,304 --> 01:37:53,107
[Patrizia] I did that for you.
I was being constructive.

1518
01:37:53,173 --> 01:37:56,210
I'm not gonna apologize
for that. No thanks.

1519
01:37:57,812 --> 01:38:01,482
My uncle is in prison and
my cousin thinks I'm scum.

1520
01:38:01,549 --> 01:38:03,585
And you think
that's constructive?

1521
01:38:03,651 --> 01:38:05,953
Don't pin Gucci's problems
on me, okay?

1522
01:38:06,019 --> 01:38:08,021
I'm just here mopping up
your fucking mess.

1523
01:38:08,088 --> 01:38:10,023
I never asked for your help.

1524
01:38:21,736 --> 01:38:23,270
Maurizio...

1525
01:38:23,337 --> 01:38:25,406

[sighs]

1527
01:38:30,043 --> 01:38:32,514
The only thing
I need from you...

1528
01:38:32,580 --> 01:38:36,016
is to stay away from Gucci
before you cause any more damage.

1529
01:38:37,685 --> 01:38:40,454
I can handle it by myself.

1530
01:38:40,522 --> 01:38:41,922
Is that clear?

1531
01:38:45,693 --> 01:38:48,563
Truthfully, I'm only
getting involved...

1532
01:38:48,630 --> 01:38:52,834
because you are an
incompetent, little baby idiot.

1533
01:38:52,901 --> 01:38:55,469
You're a fucking
weak little brat.

1534
01:38:55,537 --> 01:38:58,405
You really are only
one half of Gucci.

1535
01:38:58,472 --> 01:39:00,107
The shit half.

1536
01:39:04,311 --> 01:39:06,013
And you want a real man?

1537
01:39:06,079 --> 01:39:07,214

Yeah, now you can
get what you want.

01:41:29,456 --> 01:41:31,258
You know I never shop there.

So chic.

I know how to make.

You ever steal anything, Paola?

What?

1591
01:42:29,117 --> 01:42:30,585
Forgive me.

1592
01:42:30,652 --> 01:42:32,687
I am trying to teach
Alessandra...

1593
01:42:32,754 --> 01:42:35,288
the importance of not touching
other people's belongings.

1594
01:42:43,865 --> 01:42:47,334
I don't consider myself a
particularly ethical person...

1595
01:42:47,401 --> 01:42:48,803
but I am fair.

1596
01:42:52,472 --> 01:42:54,809
What I cannot
wrap my head around...

1597
01:42:56,511 --> 01:42:59,714
is people who steal
just for ego.

1598
01:43:00,447 --> 01:43:02,349
Or the pleasure of it.

1599
01:43:03,584 --> 01:43:06,319
For personal satisfaction.

1600
01:43:20,902 --> 01:43:23,236
I'll have my maid
drop off the strudel.

Do you like my hair?

do you like my hair?

Oh, yes, very nice.

01:56:08,268 --> 01:56:09,403
[crowd applauding]

1788
01:56:11,972 --> 01:56:13,541
[music stops]

1789
01:56:13,608 --> 01:56:16,544
[playing chatter]

1790
01:56:16,611 --> 01:56:18,746
- Where is he?
- I'm afraid he couldn't come.

1791
01:56:18,813 --> 01:56:20,849
What do you mean
he couldn't come?

1792
01:56:20,915 --> 01:56:22,817
He had a business in Paris.

1793
01:56:22,884 --> 01:56:27,187
- He's lying and so are you.
- Maurizio is very busy, Patrizia.

1794
01:56:27,254 --> 01:56:30,792
He didn't even have the decency to
come to his daughter's last recital.

1795
01:56:30,859 --> 01:56:32,192
What kind of a father is he?

1796
01:56:33,227 --> 01:56:35,095
There will be
a new arrangement.

1797
01:56:35,162 --> 01:56:37,599
And why did he send you, huh?

1798
01:56:37,665 --> 01:56:39,901
Hey, Domenico,
why did he send you?

1799
01:56:39,968 --> 01:56:41,569
What, you're his
little fucking messenger?

1800
01:56:41,636 --> 01:56:43,237
He didn't have
the decency to come here.

1801
01:56:43,303 --> 01:56:45,272
He's too much of a coward
to do it himself?

1802
01:56:45,339 --> 01:56:46,674
I have the papers right here.

1803
01:56:47,942 --> 01:56:49,409
Papers?

1804
01:56:49,476 --> 01:56:52,279
Ah, papers!
I'm not signing any papers.

1805
01:56:52,346 --> 01:56:56,183
You can tell him to come here and talk
to me like a fucking normal human being.

1806
01:56:56,250 --> 01:56:59,621
Maurizio said you and Alessandra can
continue to live in the penthouse

1807
01:56:59,687 --> 01:57:02,289
since it's no longer
his primary residence.

1808
01:57:02,356 --> 01:57:06,159
He's happy to extend payments until
you're able to stand on your own two feet.

1809
01:57:06,226 --> 01:57:08,495
- What are you talking about?
- Please.

1810
01:57:08,563 --> 01:57:11,131
What are you saying?
What are you saying to me?

1811
01:57:11,866 --> 01:57:13,467
Huh?

1812
01:57:13,535 --> 01:57:15,068
- These are words, Domenico.
- Support for Alessandra.

1813
01:57:15,135 --> 01:57:17,104
- I'm not talking to you.
- Shared custody.

1814
01:57:17,170 --> 01:57:18,706
You come to my daughter's school.
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1815
01:57:18,773 --> 01:57:20,808
Shared custody. He wants...

1816
01:57:20,875 --> 01:57:23,043
He wants to make this as easy
as possible for both of you.

1817
01:57:25,178 --> 01:57:26,548
[tearfully] Shared custody?

1818
01:57:27,414 --> 01:57:29,416
Are we talking about divorce?

1819
01:57:29,483 --> 01:57:31,351
Is that what we're doing here?

1820
01:57:34,254 --> 01:57:36,123
Where is he right now?

1821
01:57:37,491 --> 01:57:39,092
[sobbing]
Where is he right now?

1822
01:57:39,159 --> 01:57:40,494
I'm not at liberty to say.

1823
01:57:41,596 --> 01:57:43,196
Look in my eyes.

1824
01:57:46,266 --> 01:57:49,269
Do you see anything
in these eyes

1825
01:57:49,336 --> 01:57:55,142
that would let you think that I would
ever let anyone ruin my daughter's life?

1826
01:57:56,243 --> 01:57:58,078
Compromise her.

1827
01:57:59,079 --> 01:58:00,213
Do you?

1828
01:58:01,549 --> 01:58:02,784
Do you see that?

1829
01:58:05,419 --> 01:58:08,388
You know that won't happen.

1830
01:58:09,924 --> 01:58:11,559
I will relay the message.

1831
01:58:12,292 --> 01:58:14,028
Get the fuck out of here.

1832
01:58:14,094 --> 01:58:15,262
Yeah.

1833
01:58:24,104 --> 01:58:26,340
For your review, Mr. Gucci.

1834
01:58:26,406 --> 01:58:28,977
We hope you'll find
this offer appealing.

1835
01:58:29,043 --> 01:58:30,678
[Aldo] Well...

1836
01:58:30,745 --> 01:58:35,583
I'd rather not read
my own obituary, no?

1837
01:58:36,784 --> 01:58:38,753
Maestro, I can assure you

1838
01:58:38,820 --> 01:58:41,188
there's no greater admirer
of Gucci than myself.

1839
01:58:41,254 --> 01:58:42,657
[chuckling]

1840
01:58:42,724 --> 01:58:44,525
Oh, God.

1841
01:58:44,592 --> 01:58:47,461
To be able to finally sit down
with a member of the dynasty.

1842
01:58:48,529 --> 01:58:51,331
It's something
we will cherish forever.

1843
01:58:52,265 --> 01:58:53,735
And truly...

1844
01:58:53,801 --> 01:58:56,537
I understand
how difficult this is.

1845
01:58:56,604 --> 01:58:58,673
Please don't patronize me.

1846
01:58:58,740 --> 01:59:00,273
Please.

1847
01:59:00,340 --> 01:59:04,012
Those words
are not comforting to me.

1848
01:59:04,078 --> 01:59:09,216
They make me feel offended
in a way, I must say.

1849
01:59:09,751 --> 01:59:11,251
Mr. Gucci,

1850
01:59:11,318 --> 01:59:13,755
I have a plane
that leaves in one hour.

1851
01:59:13,821 --> 01:59:15,556
If there is a problem
with the offer...

1852
01:59:15,623 --> 01:59:17,324
Said and Omar,
they're at your disposal.

1853
01:59:17,391 --> 01:59:19,093
No, no, no.

1854
01:59:19,159 --> 01:59:22,764
[stuttering] We are very
grateful for your offer...

1855
01:59:22,830 --> 01:59:25,232
except no.

1856
01:59:25,833 --> 01:59:27,135
Right, Papa?

1857
01:59:27,200 --> 01:59:30,872
That shoe you showed me
before...

1858
01:59:30,938 --> 01:59:34,441
take a look inside your shoe
and see at the heel.

1859
01:59:34,509 --> 01:59:36,844
There's something
you should see.

1860
01:59:36,911 --> 01:59:41,314
I remember ordering
a pair of those...

1861
01:59:41,883 --> 01:59:43,518
for Clark Gable.

1862
01:59:44,719 --> 01:59:46,253
1953.

1863
01:59:47,555 --> 01:59:50,290
Right before
he did the film <i>Mogambo.</i>

1864
01:59:52,026 --> 01:59:53,861
This is the rarest of shoes.

1865
01:59:54,696 --> 01:59:56,931
You see that? You see that?

1866
01:59:56,998 --> 01:59:58,465
It's a gold leaf.

1867
01:59:59,667 --> 02:00:01,268
You know...

1868
02:00:01,334 --> 02:00:03,771
I had to stop doing that.

1869
02:00:03,838 --> 02:00:05,640
It got too expensive.

1870
02:00:09,877 --> 02:00:10,845
So.

1871
02:00:13,047 --> 02:00:14,916
Where did you get that shoe?

1872
02:00:15,983 --> 02:00:17,484
Where?

1873
02:00:17,552 --> 02:00:20,755
There's no way you bought
that shoe in London.

1874
02:00:21,488 --> 02:00:22,990
Who gave it to you?

1875
02:00:25,193 --> 02:00:26,359
Would you know?

1876
02:00:28,563 --> 02:00:30,497
My, he doesn't wanna answer.

1877
02:00:30,565 --> 02:00:31,899
[Paolo]
Well, that's the least...

1878
02:00:31,966 --> 02:00:33,366
[Aldo] This meeting is over.

1879
02:00:34,168 --> 02:00:36,269
I broke up the meeting.

1880
02:00:37,905 --> 02:00:39,372
Where is he going?

1881
02:00:39,439 --> 02:00:41,274
[Nemir] I'm very sorry.

1882
02:00:41,341 --> 02:00:42,476
I had no choice.

1883
02:00:48,683 --> 02:00:49,684
Aldo.

1884
02:00:51,284 --> 02:00:52,452
[exclaiming]

1885
02:00:53,154 --> 02:00:54,421
Did you know this?

1886
02:00:56,791 --> 02:00:57,792
No.

1887
02:00:59,359 --> 02:01:00,895
No!

1888
02:01:05,133 --> 02:01:06,534
Maurizio.

1889
02:01:10,938 --> 02:01:13,541
You fucking traitor.

1890
02:01:20,882 --> 02:01:21,816
[sighs]

1891
02:01:31,793 --> 02:01:32,894
[sobs]

1892
02:01:54,515 --> 02:01:57,350
This is what you want?

1893
02:02:12,967 --> 02:02:14,334
[grunts]

1894
02:02:16,804 --> 02:02:18,338
Congratulations.

1895
02:02:20,041 --> 02:02:24,879
You are now the majority
shareholder...

1896
02:02:26,446 --> 02:02:27,682
of Gucci.

1897
02:02:29,183 --> 02:02:30,818
You must feel wonderful.

1898
02:02:50,872 --> 02:02:51,806
Boof.

1899
02:02:56,244 --> 02:02:57,511
[man] You need to relax.

1900
02:02:57,578 --> 02:02:59,747
Relax. Relax.

1901
02:02:59,814 --> 02:03:02,650
You floating.
You floating like in the air.

1902
02:03:02,717 --> 02:03:04,285
Floating. Floating.

1903
02:03:04,352 --> 02:03:06,621
From there to there.
Go left to right.

1904
02:03:06,687 --> 02:03:11,092
[Maurizio] Ms. Wintour, walk into any one
of Gucci's 144 international boutiques

1905
02:03:11,158 --> 02:03:13,828
and you will find you are
walking into a new world.

1906
02:03:13,895 --> 02:03:15,630
A new vision.

1907
02:03:15,696 --> 02:03:20,835
But wasn't the lure of Gucci
precisely its historical appeal?

1908
02:03:21,569 --> 02:03:24,839
The legacy is remarkable.

1909
02:03:24,906 --> 02:03:27,375
[Maurizio] Well, this is true.

1910
02:03:27,440 --> 02:03:30,410
<i>We are products of our past but we
don't have to be prisoners of it.</i>

1911
02:03:31,279 --> 02:03:33,281
<i>I don't fear change.</i>

1912
02:03:33,347 --> 02:03:34,548
<i>I embrace it.</i>

1913
02:03:35,883 --> 02:03:39,787
Where Ralph Lauren stores,
they feel like movie sets

1914
02:03:39,854 --> 02:03:41,989
and Versace
is a rock concert,

1915
02:03:42,056 --> 02:03:45,826
Gucci stores will feel
like the Vatican of fashion.

1916
02:03:45,893 --> 02:03:48,428
["Ashes to Ashes" playing]

1917
02:03:51,565 --> 02:03:52,767
<i>Grazie.</i>

1918
02:04:07,014 --> 02:04:11,085
How are you funding
your vision?

1919
02:04:11,152 --> 02:04:13,988
- [Maurizio] Well, that is a very good secret.
- [chuckles]

1920
02:04:17,291 --> 02:04:18,592
Don't ask.

1921
02:04:23,130 --> 02:04:25,498
It may take some time
to recover...

1922
02:04:26,367 --> 02:04:28,869
but this is a long-term plan.

1923
02:04:28,936 --> 02:04:32,505
<i>Sometimes you have to go down
to come back up again.</i>

1924
02:04:33,841 --> 02:04:36,844
Ferre, Armani, and Versace!

1925
02:04:36,911 --> 02:04:39,113
That's who I said I wanted
designing our new line.

1926
02:04:39,180 --> 02:04:41,248
And they would be honored
to be working for us.

1927
02:04:41,315 --> 02:04:43,117
De Sole,
where the fuck are they?

1928
02:04:43,184 --> 02:04:46,721
Maurizio, they have
their own lines.

1929
02:04:46,787 --> 02:04:48,089
They're their own bosses.

1930
02:04:48,155 --> 02:04:50,124
I know they have...

1931
02:04:50,191 --> 02:04:52,593
I've spoken to everybody.
Nobody wants to...

1932
02:04:52,660 --> 02:04:54,762
Then you haven't tried
hard enough.

1933
02:04:56,263 --> 02:04:58,132
There is someone.

1934
02:04:58,199 --> 02:04:59,800
Maybe.

1935
02:04:59,867 --> 02:05:00,801
Here.

1936
02:05:09,810 --> 02:05:11,112
Who am I looking at?

1937
02:05:12,213 --> 02:05:13,848
He's from Texas.

1938
02:05:14,682 --> 02:05:16,050
A mechanic?

1939
02:05:16,951 --> 02:05:18,986
Maybe you should meet him.

1940
02:05:19,053 --> 02:05:22,056
[man] I see cranked up blacks.

1941
02:05:22,123 --> 02:05:24,091
Jewel-tone velvet.

1942
02:05:24,158 --> 02:05:26,293
And unconventional
styling touches.

1943
02:05:26,360 --> 02:05:28,829
Loafers, sans socks.

1944
02:05:28,896 --> 02:05:31,532
I see pole dancers
flanking the runways.

1945
02:05:31,999 --> 02:05:33,067
Female...

1946
02:05:34,235 --> 02:05:35,736
and male, of course.

1947
02:05:40,007 --> 02:05:44,812
I have a vocabulary that
will allow you to expand.

1948
02:05:44,879 --> 02:05:46,647
That's what the brand requires.

1949
02:05:46,714 --> 02:05:48,682
That's where we need to head.

1950
02:05:48,749 --> 02:05:52,920
Without sacrificing the family
character of what this brand is.

1951
02:05:52,987 --> 02:05:54,688
The family character
is the brand.

1952
02:05:56,824 --> 02:05:59,160
I'm here to embellish.
I'm here to resurrect.

1953
02:06:05,066 --> 02:06:06,100
[chuckles]

1954
02:06:15,576 --> 02:06:17,044
[Patrizia] Maurizio.

1955
02:06:17,111 --> 02:06:19,313
Stop. Please,
please, please.

1956
02:06:19,380 --> 02:06:20,714
I'm begging you.
Please stop.

1957
02:06:22,016 --> 02:06:25,152
Okay, I... I don't want
a confrontation.

1958
02:06:25,219 --> 02:06:26,654
Me neither.

1959
02:06:26,720 --> 02:06:28,055
I tried calling.

1960
02:06:28,122 --> 02:06:32,493
Yes, and calling
and calling and calling.

1961
02:06:32,561 --> 02:06:34,061

02:17:54,108 --> 02:17:55,877
We're all friends here.

2137
02:17:55,943 --> 02:17:58,345
We can, we all
respect each other.

2138
02:17:59,213 --> 02:18:00,347
[Maurizio] <i>Grazie.</i>

2139
02:18:03,283 --> 02:18:04,819
We're very concerned.

2140
02:18:06,888 --> 02:18:09,023
What concerns you?

2141
02:18:09,090 --> 02:18:10,858
Numbers.

2142
02:18:10,925 --> 02:18:12,459
Specifically, Gucci's.

2143
02:18:14,829 --> 02:18:16,798
Well, you said you didn't care
about numbers.

2144
02:18:16,864 --> 02:18:19,567
That you trusted your instinct.

2145
02:18:19,634 --> 02:18:22,335
Yeah. I care about numbers
when they're terrible numbers.

2146
02:18:24,872 --> 02:18:28,408
Our projections for 1996
are abysmal.

2147
02:18:29,644 --> 02:18:31,512
By slashing hundreds of
profitable items...

2148
02:18:31,579 --> 02:18:33,581
You mean
my uncle's knickknacks?

2149
02:18:37,251 --> 02:18:41,488
[man] Losses are likely to total
$30 million this year on sales

2150
02:18:41,556 --> 02:18:43,558
of $180 million.

2151
02:18:43,624 --> 02:18:46,828
Down from $210 million in 1991.

2152
02:18:48,129 --> 02:18:50,497
And $270 million.

2153
02:18:51,566 --> 02:18:54,602
There is $85 million
in bank debts.

2154
02:18:54,669 --> 02:18:59,372
We may even have trouble paying
salaries for the next couple of months.

2155
02:19:00,141 --> 02:19:03,077
Profits remain elusive.

2156
02:19:03,144 --> 02:19:06,581
And I've always said that our
strategic plan would take five years.

2157
02:19:06,647 --> 02:19:08,415
It's not about
immediate profit.

2158
02:19:08,481 --> 02:19:10,417
You go down
to come back up again.

2159
02:19:10,483 --> 02:19:12,086
That is how you get out
of a stall.

2160
02:19:12,153 --> 02:19:14,856
But the personal items
are a concern as well.

2161
02:19:16,524 --> 02:19:20,228
All paid for through Gucci's
accounts and charged as expenses.

2162
02:19:20,294 --> 02:19:22,763
The multimillion-dollar
antiques in the stores.

2163
02:19:22,830 --> 02:19:24,699
The purchase
of countless cars

2164
02:19:24,765 --> 02:19:27,500
including a Ferrari F40
and a Lamborghini Countach.

2165
02:19:27,568 --> 02:19:30,938
$3 million on a watch,
a Patek Philippe 2523.

2166
02:19:31,005 --> 02:19:32,940
$7 million on
a luxury penthouse.

2167
02:19:33,007 --> 02:19:34,507
I could go on and on.

2168
02:19:34,575 --> 02:19:37,111
An 18th century palatial villa
outside Florence

2169
02:19:37,178 --> 02:19:38,913
for use as a training center.

2170
02:19:38,980 --> 02:19:41,315
I have justifications
for all of these things

2171
02:19:41,381 --> 02:19:44,285
but it doesn't seem that
you're in a place to hear them.

2172
02:19:44,352 --> 02:19:48,089
Maurizio, please try and take this
in the spirit of our friendship.

2173
02:19:49,590 --> 02:19:51,158
We've been through
a lot together.

2174
02:19:52,360 --> 02:19:54,461
You have many qualities.

2175
02:19:54,528 --> 02:19:56,297
But we must be realistic.

2176
02:19:56,364 --> 02:19:58,799
You're not a natural manager.

2177
02:19:58,866 --> 02:20:03,470
You can't run a business purely
on charm and eccentricities.

2178
02:20:03,537 --> 02:20:05,740
No. You need time as well.

2179
02:20:08,576 --> 02:20:10,511
Last night does mark
a new chapter for Gucci

2180
02:20:10,578 --> 02:20:11,979
and I am the one
that brought it to you.

2181
02:20:12,046 --> 02:20:14,982
Maurizio, I want you
to understand

2182
02:20:15,049 --> 02:20:18,853
whatever happens between
both of our companies,

2183
02:20:18,920 --> 02:20:23,624
I have never stopped
respecting you or your vision.

2184
02:20:25,458 --> 02:20:27,862
But I have vision
for my people too.

2185
02:20:27,929 --> 02:20:29,897
And I have a business to run.

2186
02:20:36,971 --> 02:20:39,740
We want to offer you
$150 million

2187
02:20:39,807 --> 02:20:41,509
for your 50% stake in Gucci.

2188
02:20:41,575 --> 02:20:44,145
[chuckles softly]
You want to buy me out.

2189
02:20:44,211 --> 02:20:46,047
[Domenico]
We want to save the business.

2190
02:20:46,981 --> 02:20:49,116

appointed CEO?

[chuckles]

2192
02:21:00,728 --> 02:21:02,596
She was right about you.

2193
02:21:07,001 --> 02:21:09,370
$150 million.

2194
02:21:09,437 --> 02:21:10,805
You'll be a rich man.

2195
02:21:10,871 --> 02:21:12,640
If you really think
it's about money,

2196
02:21:12,707 --> 02:21:15,142
then you know less about Gucci
than I thought.

- Yes.

This meat.
Where is it coming from?

2201
02:21:42,169 --> 02:21:44,538
This is the finest beef
in Tuscany.

2202
02:21:44,605 --> 02:21:46,407
It comes from
the Val di Chiana.

2203
