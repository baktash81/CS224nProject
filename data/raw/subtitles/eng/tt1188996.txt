00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:10,666
Would you come with me, Sir?

00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:29,583
Hands in front.

Hands behind your head.

6
00:05:41,834 --> 00:05:43,499
Behind your head and turn around.

7
00:05:43,709 --> 00:05:45,499
Open your mouth. Open your mouth.

8
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,708
Anything on the watch-list, George?

9
00:06:03,709 --> 00:06:06,083
No flags. He's clean.

10
00:06:08,709 --> 00:06:11,749
Okay. Mr. Khan, we are done here.

11
00:06:14,167 --> 00:06:15,416
You can go.

Put your stuff in your bag.

00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:22,666
Gone. lt's gone.. my last
flight to Washington DC has left.

14
00:06:23,417 --> 00:06:25,666
The last American
Airlines flight has left.

15
00:06:25,667 --> 00:06:28,541
The next flight leaves after
seven hours and five minutes.

16
00:06:28,542 --> 00:06:31,541
United 59. United.. United 59.

17
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,208
lt leaves in the morning at 6.10.
Ticket $366.. it costs $366.

18
00:06:37,209 --> 00:06:40,166
l don't have the money.

19
00:06:40,167 --> 00:06:41,958
l have to take a bus
to Washington DC now.

20
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:45,624
Okay. l have to take a
bus to Washington DC now.

21
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:47,708
Why are you going to Washington DC?

22
00:06:48,292 --> 00:06:51,749
l am going to meet the
President of the United States.

23
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:57,208
Why is that? ls he
a friend of yours?

24
00:06:57,209 --> 00:07:00,666
Oh, no, no, no, no. He's
not a friend. No, no, no.

25
00:07:00,667 --> 00:07:02,874
l have something to say to him.

26
00:07:03,834 --> 00:07:05,249
Oh yeah?
- Yes.

27
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:09,083
Well, tell the President
something from me too then.

28
00:07:09,084 --> 00:07:13,708
Okay. Okay.
- Tell him l said, howdy.

29
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,624
Howdy? How.. Okay.

30
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,124
Pen?

31
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:24,291
J. Marshall.

32
00:07:24,584 --> 00:07:26,916
John.
- John.

33
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:30,208
John.
- John. John Marshall says howdy.

34
00:07:30,459 --> 00:07:33,083
Howdy. Okay. Howdy.

35
00:07:33,084 --> 00:07:35,833
Yes. Okay. Okay.
John Marshall says..

36
00:07:35,834 --> 00:07:38,916
But l have.. my own
message to give to him first.

37
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:40,624
Oh yeah? What is that?

38
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:42,333
You know where Osama is?

39
00:07:42,334 --> 00:07:46,666
Oh, no, no, no, no. No. This
is not my message. No, no, no.

40
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,958
What is your message, Mr. Khan?

41
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,624
l have to say to him..

42
00:07:54,417 --> 00:07:57,624
My name is Khan. And
l am not a terrorist.

43
00:08:56,417 --> 00:08:59,333
May Allah bless this
letter l'm writing to you.

44
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:02,124
The book 'Different Minds' says..

45
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:05,624
..that people like us can't
express their emotions in words.

46
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:08,083
But we can write them easily.

47
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:11,458
l can fill thousands of pages,
millions of times with..

48
00:09:11,667 --> 00:09:13,374
'l love you, Mandira.'

49
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,999
But not once could l say it to you.

50
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,249
Perhaps that's why
you are angry with me.

51
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,333
l had promised you that l
would meet the President..

52
00:09:21,334 --> 00:09:23,791
..so, my attempts are on.

53
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,166
Meanwhile whenever l have time,
l will write all..

54
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:30,374
..that l couldn't say to you.

55
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,916
And then, you will love me again.

56
00:09:42,209 --> 00:09:44,708
My Abbu (father) Dilawar
Amanullah Khan worked for..

57
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:47,749
..the S.T. workshop in Borivali.

58
00:09:48,042 --> 00:09:49,833
He took me with
him to work everyday.

59
00:09:49,834 --> 00:09:52,958
And left me to play in the garage.

60
00:09:53,209 --> 00:09:56,749
l know how to repair
broken things since then.

61
00:09:57,209 --> 00:10:01,208
Strangely, l could
never repair Abbu.

62
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,999
Hey, is this your dad's place?

63
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,916
Go home and kill your time.

64
00:10:05,917 --> 00:10:07,249
Kill? Kill?

65
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,958
Get out now! Out!

66
00:10:19,667 --> 00:10:23,666
You fool! ldiot! Ruined my clothes!

67
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,041
Ammi.. Ammi.. Ammi..

68
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:37,124
Zakir is sleeping.

69
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:38,291
What's this?

70
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,999
'Kill time.'
- How did you get so wet?

71
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,499
'Kill time.' l want to 'kill time.'
- What?

72
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,041
Abdul Workshop asked me to
go home and 'kill time.'

73
00:10:45,292 --> 00:10:47,208
How do l do that?

74
00:10:47,209 --> 00:10:48,499
'Kill time? '

75
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,499
ls that what the devil told you?

76
00:10:52,834 --> 00:10:55,291
Okay. l'll teach you
how to 'kill time.'

77
00:10:55,500 --> 00:11:01,124
Like this. Like this.

78
00:11:02,042 --> 00:11:04,583
This way.

79
00:11:10,584 --> 00:11:12,249
Come on, Rizu.

80
00:11:13,042 --> 00:11:15,166
Give me a hug.. just once?

81
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:18,374
Come on. Come on.

82
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:24,124
My Ammi (mother) Razia Khan.

83
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:26,541
l feel peace when you hug me.

84
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,541
She was from Jalalpur, UP.

85
00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:32,124
She embroidered clothes.

86
00:11:32,542 --> 00:11:36,708
No doctor could tell her
why l was the way l was.

87
00:11:36,709 --> 00:11:39,958
But Ammi.. She never
felt the need to know why.

88
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:42,624
l don't know how, but
she found a way to know me.

89
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:44,624
Just like you.

90
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,958
Fools! All of them!!

91
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:54,374
Each one of them should
be shot dead mercilessly!

92
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:56,208
Didn't even spare our women!

93
00:11:56,209 --> 00:11:58,166
Dogs! Rogues! ldiots!

94
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:00,874
Are you guys with me?

95
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:02,833
Rogues. All of them.

96
00:12:02,834 --> 00:12:04,916
Each one of them should
be shot dead mercilessly.

97
00:12:08,667 --> 00:12:10,499
l had told you not to step out.

98
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,291
Now, come on. Let's eat.

99
00:12:12,292 --> 00:12:14,583
Rogues. All of them.

100
00:12:14,584 --> 00:12:18,541
Each one of them should
be shot dead mercilessly.

101
00:12:18,792 --> 00:12:20,333
Rogues. All of them.

102
00:12:20,334 --> 00:12:21,791
What did you say?

103
00:12:21,792 --> 00:12:23,333
Rogues. All of them.

104
00:12:23,334 --> 00:12:24,499
Where did you hear that?

105
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,791
Each one of them
should be shot dead.

106
00:12:25,792 --> 00:12:26,958
Shut up!

107
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,083
Rogues. All of them.

108
00:12:28,084 --> 00:12:30,166
Shut up, Rizu.

109
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:32,083
Come with me. come.

110
00:12:32,792 --> 00:12:34,499
Look at this.

111
00:12:35,167 --> 00:12:39,499
This is you. Rizvan. Who?

112
00:12:40,167 --> 00:12:41,833
Rizvan.
- Yes.

113
00:12:42,084 --> 00:12:47,208
And this is the person who
has a stick in his hand.

114
00:12:47,209 --> 00:12:49,166
And he is beating you.

115
00:12:49,167 --> 00:12:52,249
lt's bad.. beating is bad.
- Yes. lt's bad.

116
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,666
Now, this is you again, Rizvan.

117
00:12:55,834 --> 00:13:00,916
And this is the
person who has a lollipop.

118
00:13:00,917 --> 00:13:02,083
And he gives it to you.

119
00:13:02,084 --> 00:13:04,333
Lollipop is sweet.
lt's a good thing.

120
00:13:04,334 --> 00:13:06,041
Good boy.
- Good boy.

121
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:10,416
Now, tell me which one of these is
a Hindu and which one, a Muslim?

122
00:13:15,417 --> 00:13:17,374
Both look alike.

123
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,124
Good.

124
00:13:20,542 --> 00:13:22,749
Remember one thing, son.

125
00:13:23,292 --> 00:13:26,749
There are only two kinds
of people in this world.

126
00:13:27,917 --> 00:13:31,249
Good people who do good deeds.

127
00:13:31,792 --> 00:13:33,958
And bad people who do bad.

128
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:37,958
That's the only
difference in human beings.

129
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:40,708
There's no other difference.
Understood?

130
00:13:41,542 --> 00:13:44,791
What did you understand?
Tell me. Tell me.

131
00:13:45,042 --> 00:13:49,749
Good people. Bad people.
No other difference.

132
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,958
Ammi's lesson was not
taught in any school.

133
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,624
Not in my school at least.

134
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:13,624
Master Wadia lives somewhere here.

135
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:15,124
Give me the map.

136
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,666
Come fast.

137
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:25,833
Rizu, what are you doing?
Stop that and come here.

138
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,624
Hang on. Coming.

139
00:14:33,084 --> 00:14:37,166
Hello. l'm Razia. This
is Rizu. l mean Rizvan.

140
00:14:37,417 --> 00:14:38,916
l have heard a lot about you.

141
00:14:38,917 --> 00:14:42,499
That you are a very learned man.
You have a lot of degrees.

142
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,999
B.A., M.A.

143
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,374
Whatever!

144
00:14:45,917 --> 00:14:51,124
But people say you don't do
anything. That's a good thing!

145
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:58,041
Rizu. My Rizu is a sharp boy.

146
00:14:58,792 --> 00:15:02,249
So, l thought if you agree to
teach him here, in your house

147
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:05,458
That way, you can pass
your time too, isn't it?

148
00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:07,166
What nonsense!

149
00:15:07,167 --> 00:15:10,583
Mr. Wadia. Mr. Wadia. Trust me.

150
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:13,499
My Rizu is an intelligent boy.

151
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:17,083
Rizu.. Talk to Mr. Wadia in English.

152
00:15:17,334 --> 00:15:20,249
Speak in English. Come on.
Say something in English.

153
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,833
Wadia. Wadia.

154
00:15:22,084 --> 00:15:25,791
Wadia family is a Parsi
family originally based in Surat.

155
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:29,041
Launji Narsolaunji Wadia
started the Wadia ship..

156
00:15:29,042 --> 00:15:31,624
..building dynasty in 1736.

157
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:34,708
When he obtained a contract from
the British East lndia Company..

158
00:15:34,709 --> 00:15:36,958
..for building docks
and ships in Bombay.

159
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:39,874
Wadia. Wadia.

160
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,499
The highway man came riding..

161
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,999
..riding up to the old lnn-door.

162
00:15:47,584 --> 00:15:53,333
The highway man came
riding up to the old lnn-door.

163
00:15:55,584 --> 00:16:03,999
Ammi.. l'm hungry.
Let's go. l'm hungry.

164
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,499
Ammi said master
Wadia was a good man.

165
00:16:07,959 --> 00:16:11,374
Good people did good deeds.

166
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,833
Master Wadia taught
me a lot of things.

167
00:16:14,834 --> 00:16:18,416
About books. And about life too.

168
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:25,208
Rizvan. Rizvan, don't come here.

169
00:16:25,209 --> 00:16:28,624
There's too much water.
Go home! Go home!

170
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:38,833
Mr. Wadia. What are
you doing? come out!

171
00:16:38,834 --> 00:16:41,999
Your pupil is amazing!

172
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,791
What's going on? Why
are you guys screaming?

173
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:50,666
Rizvan, what are you doing?
l asked you to go home.

174
00:17:00,709 --> 00:17:02,041
Too good.

175
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,333
You are pumping water out.

176
00:17:04,334 --> 00:17:07,333
That's amazing. Genius. Genius.

177
00:17:08,417 --> 00:17:10,624
He is my pupil. My pupil.

178
00:17:26,542 --> 00:17:29,333
You think he can repair all this?

179
00:17:32,667 --> 00:17:34,208
You know, Mr. Wadia?

180
00:17:34,209 --> 00:17:36,166
My Rizu did nothing short
of a miracle near his house.

181
00:17:36,167 --> 00:17:37,874
The water had filled till here.
- Mother!

182
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:40,166
One minute! The water was till here.

183
00:17:40,167 --> 00:17:43,166
Rizu fixed some motor
type of thing. One minute!

184
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:45,291
Put the motor in the water,
and the water was gone!

185
00:17:45,292 --> 00:17:47,208
l saw it with my own eyes.

186
00:17:47,209 --> 00:17:48,291
Really?
- Yes.

187
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,666
Zakir.

188
00:17:55,167 --> 00:17:56,958
You won a cup, didn't you?

189
00:17:58,042 --> 00:17:59,874
l'm really happy about that.

190
00:18:01,167 --> 00:18:02,624
And Rizu?

191
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,416
Even he is happy for you.

192
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,958
You should be happy too.

193
00:18:09,334 --> 00:18:11,083
He is your brother, isn't he?

194
00:18:11,084 --> 00:18:13,666
Good boy. Wipe your tears.

195
00:18:13,917 --> 00:18:15,124
Come on.

196
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:25,874
You are my good son, aren't you?

197
00:18:27,709 --> 00:18:30,541
Zakir was fortunate.

198
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:32,666
He could cry.

199
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:39,624
Zakir, Rizu says it's
going to be very cold there.

200
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:42,124
You have taken everything,
right? Don't forget anything.

201
00:18:44,292 --> 00:18:46,083
l will miss you, my son.

202
00:18:46,084 --> 00:18:48,374
Only if you find time from
bhai (brother) will you miss me!

203
00:18:56,459 --> 00:19:00,708
As soon as he completed 18 years,
Zakir left for America.

204
00:19:00,709 --> 00:19:04,166
He got a scholarship
at Michigan University.

205
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,541
l felt very bad when he left.

206
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:13,541
But l never told him.

207
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,749
And in just a few days, l
got accustomed to his absence.

208
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,749
Ammi. Hasina teaches
at the university.

209
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:24,916
She can't leave mid-term and come.

210
00:19:26,084 --> 00:19:30,083
lt's her first Eid (festival)
in the family after the wedding.

211
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:35,458
We haven't even seen her yet.
Come here, please.

212
00:19:36,584 --> 00:19:37,999
Ammi.

213
00:19:38,417 --> 00:19:39,833
Don't worry.

214
00:19:39,834 --> 00:19:42,124
Your immigration will
be done in a few days.

215
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,458
Then you will live with us.

216
00:19:46,542 --> 00:19:50,416
l won't go anywhere without Rizvan.

217
00:19:52,834 --> 00:19:54,249
l know that.

218
00:19:54,584 --> 00:19:56,416
l'm sponsoring bhai as well.

219
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,874
Okay, Ammi. l have to hang
up now. l'll call later.

220
00:20:02,917 --> 00:20:04,124
Yeah?

221
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:25,916
Oh, Lord.
- Oh, lord.

222
00:20:29,542 --> 00:20:31,458
Ammi, you should sleep now.

223
00:20:31,459 --> 00:20:34,416
Sleeping calms the mind and
provides rest to the body.

224
00:20:34,917 --> 00:20:36,291
Shut up!

225
00:20:36,709 --> 00:20:38,708
Nothing is wrong with me.

226
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,416
Just missing Zakir, that's all.

227
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:44,624
His laughter.

228
00:20:45,167 --> 00:20:46,666
His anger.

229
00:20:47,209 --> 00:20:48,916
The sound of his gargling.

230
00:20:48,917 --> 00:20:52,083
At 7am. At 2pm. 9pm.

231
00:21:15,917 --> 00:21:17,791
Enough peace?

232
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:24,958
Please, Rizu. Two minutes?
Only two minutes.

233
00:21:27,084 --> 00:21:28,958
Only two minutes?

234
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:37,124
1001, 1002.

235
00:21:37,459 --> 00:21:40,833
But Mandira, the effect
of those two minutes..

236
00:21:40,834 --> 00:21:45,999
..lasted only for six months,
four days and 17 hours.

237
00:21:56,625 --> 00:22:01,208
Ammi died of
congestive cardiomyopathy.

238
00:22:01,584 --> 00:22:05,541
Her heart became too
big for its own good.

239
00:22:16,042 --> 00:22:18,833
Before dying, Ammi made me promise..

240
00:22:18,834 --> 00:22:22,874
..that like Zakir, l would
make a happy life for myself.

241
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:27,291
That l would go to America.

242
00:22:42,292 --> 00:22:47,208
And then l came here
to your favourite city.

243
00:22:47,209 --> 00:22:48,874
San Francisco.

244
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:57,666
And it was scary. Very scary.

245
00:23:19,917 --> 00:23:22,249
Bhai, this is Hasina.

246
00:23:23,167 --> 00:23:24,833
Hello, bhai.

247
00:23:26,584 --> 00:23:28,124
How are you?

248
00:23:31,917 --> 00:23:34,499
Hope your flight was comfortable.
- Hello.

249
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,874
Come on. Let's go in.

250
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:40,749
Hello to you too.

251
00:23:42,375 --> 00:23:44,624
Zakir's wife, Hasina.

252
00:23:45,459 --> 00:23:47,916
She was from Brooklyn, New York.

253
00:23:47,917 --> 00:23:51,499
She taught psychology
in the university here.

254
00:23:52,417 --> 00:23:55,874
She was the first to find out..

255
00:24:05,709 --> 00:24:09,916
..that l had Asperger's Syndrome.

256
00:24:11,834 --> 00:24:15,499
My fear of new places. New people.

257
00:24:17,709 --> 00:24:21,249
My hatred for the colour
yellow and sharp sounds.

258
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,374
The reason for me
being so different..

259
00:24:27,375 --> 00:24:29,958
..from everyone was
defined in just two words..

260
00:24:31,209 --> 00:24:33,916
..Asperger's Syndrome.

261
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:37,458
Take this.

262
00:24:37,459 --> 00:24:40,708
When you look through this
it will be like watching TV.

263
00:24:40,709 --> 00:24:42,083
TV?

264
00:24:42,084 --> 00:24:45,124
This way, you won't be
scared of new places or roads.

265
00:24:45,125 --> 00:24:46,708
Not scared?
- No.

266
00:24:46,709 --> 00:24:49,083
Just press this button. See.. try?

267
00:24:55,834 --> 00:24:58,083
l took bhai to the Autistic Society.

268
00:24:58,084 --> 00:25:00,249
Hi, Mrs. Brennan.
- Hi.

269
00:25:00,584 --> 00:25:02,208
Sorry.
- l had.

270
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:04,583
Mrs. Brennan there
believes that bhai is better..

271
00:25:04,584 --> 00:25:07,124
..than most people with Asperger's.

272
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:12,041
Maybe in odd ways, but at
least he can express his feelings.

273
00:25:12,834 --> 00:25:15,749
And l think your Ammi had
a lot to with it, Zakir.

274
00:25:21,959 --> 00:25:23,583
Good morning.
- Good morning.

275
00:25:24,084 --> 00:25:25,583
This is our office.

276
00:25:25,584 --> 00:25:27,333
Come in. Have a good look.

277
00:25:27,334 --> 00:25:28,541
Have a good look.

278
00:25:28,542 --> 00:25:30,416
What are you doing? come this way.

279
00:25:31,084 --> 00:25:33,041
What did l have when
l came to America?

280
00:25:33,042 --> 00:25:35,041
Nothing. But today?

281
00:25:35,042 --> 00:25:36,499
See for yourself.

282
00:25:36,875 --> 00:25:40,249
l am the biggest dealer
for Mehnaz Herbal Products.

283
00:25:40,792 --> 00:25:44,208
Because this is America.
- America.

284
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:46,916
Here, the harder you work,
the more successful you get.

285
00:25:46,917 --> 00:25:50,041
America. - l have worked
very hard. Now, it's your turn.

286
00:25:50,042 --> 00:25:51,333
America.
- Okay?

287
00:25:51,334 --> 00:25:52,541
Shall we? Come.

288
00:25:55,042 --> 00:25:56,999
Not that way. This way

289
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,749
America.
- Come.

290
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:02,041
These are all our products
and these are the details.

291
00:26:02,375 --> 00:26:04,666
You will be given the names
and addresses of all the salons.

292
00:26:04,667 --> 00:26:07,749
You will go to every one of
them and sell these. Understand?

293
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:09,916
No.
- You will.

294
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,499
Mehnaz Herbal Beauty Products.

295
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:21,916
Mehnaz..

296
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:30,041
The rose water in the clay mask
cleans and clarifies your skin..

297
00:26:30,042 --> 00:26:33,874
..and makes you glow
like a newly-wed bride.

298
00:26:34,875 --> 00:26:37,333
A newly-wed bride.

299
00:26:41,625 --> 00:26:46,458
Mehnaz Herbal Beauty Products.
All of them.

300
00:26:46,459 --> 00:26:51,874
Mehnaz Herbal Beauty Products will
make you glow like a newly-wed bride.

301
00:26:51,875 --> 00:26:53,583
l'm divorced.

302
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:56,791
We have nothing for
the newly-divorced.

303
00:26:57,334 --> 00:26:59,374
Just a pimple cream won't help.

304
00:26:59,375 --> 00:27:02,874
You need to cleanse your face,
and your system.

305
00:27:02,875 --> 00:27:05,833
l think that maybe l
just need a boyfriend.

306
00:27:05,834 --> 00:27:08,583
Oh, no, no. You
don't need a boyfriend.

307
00:27:08,584 --> 00:27:11,874
You need this and Jamal Gota.

308
00:27:12,084 --> 00:27:13,666
lndian laxative.

309
00:27:14,375 --> 00:27:18,166
lt says that the product
will reach you in seven days.

310
00:27:18,167 --> 00:27:19,333
We're lying.

311
00:27:19,334 --> 00:27:21,374
lt will reach you only in ten days.

312
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:31,124
Move!

313
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,958
Come on! Move it!

314
00:28:42,417 --> 00:28:44,583
Come on. Get out of
the way, you freak.

315
00:28:45,334 --> 00:28:47,333
No, no, no.

316
00:28:50,334 --> 00:28:51,958
Get out of here. Come on.

317
00:28:51,959 --> 00:28:53,374
Hey, you guys, just leave him alone.

318
00:28:53,375 --> 00:28:54,541
Stop it.

319
00:28:54,542 --> 00:28:56,416
Stop it, okay? Just go.

320
00:28:56,792 --> 00:28:58,249
Go, please.

321
00:29:00,792 --> 00:29:02,166
Are you okay?

322
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,874
Are you scared?

323
00:29:05,875 --> 00:29:07,083
lt's okay.

324
00:29:07,084 --> 00:29:09,583
Look, there's nothing
wrong with being scared.

325
00:29:10,125 --> 00:29:12,166
Just don't make your fear so large..

326
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,041
..that it stops you
from achieving your goal.

327
00:29:14,042 --> 00:29:16,333
Okay? All right, bye.

328
00:29:56,917 --> 00:29:59,291
Hello. Welcome to Karma.

329
00:29:59,667 --> 00:30:00,916
l'm the manager here.

330
00:30:00,917 --> 00:30:02,333
Can l help you?

331
00:30:04,417 --> 00:30:05,999
Oh God.

332
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,583
l think you have recognised me.

333
00:30:08,959 --> 00:30:11,166
lt's all right. Don't be shy.

334
00:30:11,542 --> 00:30:14,208
l am Rita Singh. Ex Miss lndia.

335
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,249
These blow-dryers..

336
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:19,041
l am Rita Singh. Ex Miss lndia.

337
00:30:19,042 --> 00:30:23,666
You look old. You must have
been Miss lndia before l was born.

338
00:30:23,959 --> 00:30:25,333
Okay?

339
00:30:31,292 --> 00:30:35,291
The theory of entrainment
in Physics states that..

340
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:40,208
..some specific sounds
increase the rate of your heartbeat.

341
00:30:46,584 --> 00:30:48,374
For me, Mandira..

342
00:30:48,792 --> 00:30:54,124
..that specific sound has always
been the sound of your laughter.

343
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,041
So, you were coming here?

344
00:30:58,042 --> 00:30:59,916
Don't take it personally, Rita.

345
00:31:00,667 --> 00:31:02,458
l hope you've come for a haircut.

346
00:31:02,792 --> 00:31:04,874
You have got great hair.
- Okay.

347
00:31:05,542 --> 00:31:07,291
Okay.
- Okay. - Take an appointment.

348
00:31:07,292 --> 00:31:11,291
My name is Rizvan Khan. Khan. Khan.

349
00:31:12,167 --> 00:31:15,041
l may look a little strange to you..

350
00:31:15,042 --> 00:31:17,833
..but that's because l
have Asperger's Syndrome.

351
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:21,333
lt's named after Dr. Hans Asperger.

352
00:31:21,584 --> 00:31:24,666
That doesn't mean l'm mad.

353
00:31:24,667 --> 00:31:26,666
Oh, no, no, no, no.

354
00:31:26,667 --> 00:31:28,541
l'm very intelligent.

355
00:31:28,542 --> 00:31:31,958
Very smart. Very smart.

356
00:31:31,959 --> 00:31:34,999
But there are certain
things l don't understand.

357
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,624
For instance, people say when l go
to their houses, "Come, Rizvan..

358
00:31:38,625 --> 00:31:40,291
..think of it as your own house."

359
00:31:40,292 --> 00:31:43,124
But how do l do that
when the house isn't mine?

360
00:31:43,375 --> 00:31:46,999
l don't understand why people
say one thing and think another.

361
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,291
My Ammi would say there are only
two kinds of people in the world.

362
00:31:50,292 --> 00:31:52,541
Good people and bad people.

363
00:31:52,792 --> 00:31:54,124
l'm a good person.

364
00:31:54,125 --> 00:31:56,458
l do good deeds.

365
00:31:56,459 --> 00:31:59,416
l'm here to sell Mehnaz
Herbal Beauty products.

366
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:00,874
l don't know how to sell.

367
00:32:00,875 --> 00:32:04,124
But my brother Zakir
tells me that's myjob.

368
00:32:04,459 --> 00:32:08,041
Mehnaz Herbal Beauty
products they are good products.

369
00:32:08,292 --> 00:32:10,749
l have tried them all on me.

370
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:13,624
That's why my skin glows.

371
00:32:13,875 --> 00:32:17,083
Shinning like a newly-wed bride.

372
00:32:17,875 --> 00:32:20,333
Allow me.. Allow me to show you..

373
00:32:20,334 --> 00:32:24,208
..all the Mehnaz Herbal
Beauty products, please.

374
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,291
May l?

375
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,624
Yes, you can.

376
00:32:29,875 --> 00:32:30,999
So tell me.

377
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,791
Which product will
make me beautiful?

378
00:32:32,792 --> 00:32:34,083
No.

379
00:32:34,084 --> 00:32:37,041
No product can make you beautiful.

380
00:32:37,042 --> 00:32:39,083
That's rude.
- No, no.

381
00:32:39,667 --> 00:32:42,708
Beauty products can
only enhance the skin.

382
00:32:43,042 --> 00:32:44,791
They cannot make you beautiful.

383
00:32:44,792 --> 00:32:46,041
Wow.

384
00:32:46,042 --> 00:32:47,208
A salesman, and yet
you speak the truth?

385
00:32:47,209 --> 00:32:49,083
Always. Always.

386
00:32:50,125 --> 00:32:51,291
How many products do you have?

387
00:32:51,292 --> 00:32:53,541
22. 22.

388
00:32:53,792 --> 00:32:56,291
Give six of each.
- Oh no, no, no. No.

389
00:32:56,292 --> 00:33:00,041
All our products expire
in three months. lt dies.

390
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:04,041
You need only four.
The rest will get spoilt.

391
00:33:06,125 --> 00:33:08,041
What did you say the name was?

392
00:33:08,459 --> 00:33:11,458
Mehnaz Herbal Beauty Products.

393
00:33:11,459 --> 00:33:13,041
Your name?

394
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:15,708
Rizvan Khan.

395
00:33:15,709 --> 00:33:16,791
Khan.

396
00:33:17,042 --> 00:33:18,416
l'm Mandira. -

397
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,166
Mandira.

398
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,833
Hi.
- Hi.

399
00:33:26,292 --> 00:33:29,541
Hi.

400
00:34:53,667 --> 00:34:55,999
lsn't this shocking pink
a little too shocking?

401
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,124
Not at all! lt looks beautiful!

402
00:34:58,334 --> 00:34:59,708
Pink is so your colour.

403
00:34:59,709 --> 00:35:00,999
Really?
- Yeah.

404
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,166
l agree.

405
00:35:06,959 --> 00:35:09,291
Hello. Hello.

406
00:35:09,292 --> 00:35:11,833
Hi. Nice colour.

407
00:35:11,834 --> 00:35:14,541
Oh yes. Pink is so my colour.

408
00:35:14,875 --> 00:35:17,374
Oh no, no, no. No cell phone.
No cell phone.

409
00:35:17,375 --> 00:35:18,541
Why?

410
00:35:18,542 --> 00:35:20,124
Because bees die due to cell phones.

411
00:35:20,125 --> 00:35:21,999
Who?!
- Bees. Bees. Bees.

412
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,833
Cell phone signals cause bees to
lose their way home, and they die.

413
00:35:25,834 --> 00:35:27,499
They die. They die.

414
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,666
lt's not good.

415
00:35:28,667 --> 00:35:29,958
Because Albert Einstein has said..

416
00:35:29,959 --> 00:35:32,291
Albert Einstein has apparently said.

417
00:35:32,292 --> 00:35:35,041
Apparently said.. - That if
all the bees in the world die..

418
00:35:35,042 --> 00:35:37,333
..exactly four years
after that all men will die.

419
00:35:37,334 --> 00:35:38,541
That's right. That's right.

420
00:35:38,542 --> 00:35:40,583
All men die. All men die.

421
00:35:40,584 --> 00:35:44,083
Oh no. No cell phones then. lf all
the men die, what will happen to me?

422
00:35:44,584 --> 00:35:45,749
You're bad.

423
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:49,958
This cream has an extra
care skin nourishing lotion..

424
00:35:49,959 --> 00:35:53,166
..which contains Aloe Vera,
Calamine and Jojoba oil..

425
00:35:53,167 --> 00:35:56,333
..which restore the
pH scale of the skin.

426
00:35:59,584 --> 00:36:03,999
The pH is an algorithm of
the activity of hydrogen ions..

427
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,916
..in a solution which tells
you how acidic or basic it is.

428
00:36:06,917 --> 00:36:09,333
The exponentials of
hydrogen ions being very high..

429
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:11,124
..it's not practical to measure it.

430
00:36:11,125 --> 00:36:15,624
lt's not an absolute term,
it's just a relative.

431
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,833
Basically it means..
this cream is very nice.

432
00:36:23,459 --> 00:36:25,666
Okay.
- Okay.

433
00:36:27,292 --> 00:36:30,458
l'll take it.
- Okay.

434
00:37:21,084 --> 00:37:25,583
l trained for a year and then
took a further course in LA.

435
00:37:25,584 --> 00:37:27,749
l mean.. But l did want to make it.

436
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:29,416
l think training
is really important.

437
00:37:29,417 --> 00:37:30,999
How can you cut
somebody's hair without it?

438
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,208
And that's how l came here.

439
00:37:32,209 --> 00:37:33,499
You?

440
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,416
Were you saying something to me?

441
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,041
And l think you know the most
we know the most we can do is..

442
00:37:38,042 --> 00:37:40,166
..just texturise it a
little bit, thin it out. And..

443
00:37:40,167 --> 00:37:42,999
Even l want to have my
hair cut by you, Mandira.

444
00:37:43,584 --> 00:37:45,624
Yeah. l know, Rizvan. But..

445
00:37:45,625 --> 00:37:47,999
Please, please. Please
cut my hair. Please.

446
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,791
Yeah. And l am
dying to cut your hair.

447
00:37:49,792 --> 00:37:51,208
No, no, no, no. Don't die.
- But maybe later?

448
00:37:51,209 --> 00:37:54,208
No, don't die. Just cut my hair now.

449
00:37:54,209 --> 00:37:55,791
Rizvan..
- No, now.

450
00:38:34,917 --> 00:38:36,749
So? How is it?

451
00:38:38,667 --> 00:38:43,041
Marry me.

452
00:38:43,042 --> 00:38:45,208
Liked it so much?!

453
00:38:45,209 --> 00:38:46,624
Hang on. One second.

454
00:38:46,625 --> 00:38:47,833
Marry me.
- Excuse me.

455
00:38:47,834 --> 00:38:49,041
Hello?

456
00:38:49,834 --> 00:38:50,999
Sameer.

457
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,249
Hi. Reached home?

458
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:53,999
Okay. Okay, l'm coming.

459
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,749
Bye. Love you.

460
00:38:57,084 --> 00:38:58,374
Sameer?

461
00:39:00,542 --> 00:39:03,208
Sameer! Sameer! Sam!

462
00:39:03,209 --> 00:39:05,499
Come on. Please, hurry up.
- Coming!

463
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:09,249
Quickly. Come on! come on! Come on!

464
00:39:09,459 --> 00:39:11,624
You put everything into the bag?
- Yup.

465
00:39:11,625 --> 00:39:13,374
Summer camp project?
- Yup.

466
00:39:13,375 --> 00:39:14,958
Lunch.
- Yup.

467
00:39:14,959 --> 00:39:16,291
Soccer gear?

468
00:39:16,292 --> 00:39:17,791
l think l forgot.

469
00:39:17,792 --> 00:39:20,833
Mom, stop acting. You
forgot deliberately.

470
00:39:20,834 --> 00:39:22,124
Do you have to play soccer?

471
00:39:22,125 --> 00:39:23,374
lt's dangerous. What
if you get hurt playing?

472
00:39:23,375 --> 00:39:25,083
What if l get hurt
running this way with you?

473
00:39:25,084 --> 00:39:26,249
Nothing will happen to you here.

474
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:28,333
l'm here. Your Mom!

475
00:39:28,334 --> 00:39:30,958
Mom, stop being so dramatic.
You are such a drama queen.

476
00:39:31,125 --> 00:39:32,666
Yeah, l am.

477
00:39:32,667 --> 00:39:36,291
Okay. Almost there.
Almost there. Almost there.

478
00:39:36,292 --> 00:39:37,499
Thank God. We are on time.

479
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,833
Okay. Bye, Mom.

480
00:39:39,542 --> 00:39:41,124
Where's my hug? Where's my kiss?

481
00:39:41,125 --> 00:39:42,999
Stop it, Mom. l have got reputation.

482
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,291
Reputation.

483
00:39:44,292 --> 00:39:45,874
Bye!
- Bye!

484
00:39:45,875 --> 00:39:48,958
Bye! The apple of my eye.
Love me till l die..

485
00:39:53,292 --> 00:39:55,499
Oh God. Oh shit.

486
00:40:01,084 --> 00:40:02,791
Hey, Rizvan. Hi.

487
00:40:02,792 --> 00:40:05,041
Hi. Any sales appointment?

488
00:40:05,042 --> 00:40:06,374
You are divorced.

489
00:40:06,375 --> 00:40:07,541
Divorced.

490
00:40:07,542 --> 00:40:09,583
Rita told me you are divorced.

491
00:40:09,584 --> 00:40:12,999
You were 19 when you
had an arranged marriage.

492
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,624
You came to America
with your husband.

493
00:40:14,625 --> 00:40:16,083
He harassed you a
lot for three years..

494
00:40:16,084 --> 00:40:17,958
..and then left for
Australia with another woman.

495
00:40:17,959 --> 00:40:20,874
lt must take a long time to
run till Australia, right?

496
00:40:21,417 --> 00:40:23,666
He divorced you from there and
didn't even pay you alimony.

497
00:40:23,667 --> 00:40:26,916
Such a beast! Slimy! ldiot!

498
00:40:26,917 --> 00:40:28,541
He hasn't called you even
once in the last four years.

499
00:40:28,542 --> 00:40:30,374
Hasn't even spoken to Sam.

500
00:40:30,375 --> 00:40:31,999
Now, where is he
going to come back..

501
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,708
Slimy bastard, mother..

502
00:40:33,709 --> 00:40:34,874
Mother..

503
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,583
..l can't say the next word.

504
00:40:39,125 --> 00:40:40,624
You have said enough.

505
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,833
Thank you.
- Welcome.

506
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:47,333
Marry me.
- Just go.

507
00:40:47,334 --> 00:40:49,083
Marry me.
- Just go, okay?

508
00:40:49,084 --> 00:40:50,166
Marry me.

509
00:40:59,667 --> 00:41:00,958
Okay.

510
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:05,541
Mandira..
- No, Rita.

511
00:41:05,542 --> 00:41:06,916
No more appointments tomorrow!

512
00:41:06,917 --> 00:41:09,249
Mrs. V is coming tomorrow and
her hair colouring takes time.

513
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:10,749
Okay. Bye.

514
00:41:12,709 --> 00:41:14,374
Bye.
- Bye, girl.

515
00:41:24,375 --> 00:41:26,083
Rizvan, are you okay?

516
00:41:28,584 --> 00:41:31,749
No!
- What? Rizvan!

517
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:34,541
Please..
- No..

518
00:41:34,542 --> 00:41:36,458
What happened?!

519
00:41:48,417 --> 00:41:49,708
Hi.

520
00:41:50,042 --> 00:41:51,249
You run fast.

521
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:56,999
l don't like yellow.

522
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,458
Okay.
- No.

523
00:41:58,875 --> 00:42:00,041
ls that for me?

524
00:42:00,042 --> 00:42:02,166
Yes. This and this.

525
00:42:03,042 --> 00:42:04,708
But l won't give it to you.
- Why?!

526
00:42:04,709 --> 00:42:06,624
No.
- l love balloons. - No, no, no, no.

527
00:42:06,625 --> 00:42:08,374
ln fact, Sam loves balloons.
- No.

528
00:42:08,375 --> 00:42:11,041
Whenever he sees them, he
wants to set them free in the sky.

529
00:42:11,042 --> 00:42:14,958
Red, blue, pink, green..
these colours look good on you.

530
00:42:15,375 --> 00:42:19,249
Yellow, yellow, dirty fellow.

531
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:20,416
Okay.

Let's go.

536
00:42:29,417 --> 00:42:33,291
Look. l'm sorry l was angry.

537
00:42:33,584 --> 00:42:37,291
Your words reminded me of
all that l wanted to forget.

538
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:39,916
He really was a..

539
00:42:40,375 --> 00:42:42,541
..beast. Slimy. ldiot.
- Yeah.

540
00:42:42,542 --> 00:42:44,624
Slimy. ldiot and all that.

541
00:42:44,625 --> 00:42:46,666
So, you don't love him?

542
00:42:46,917 --> 00:42:49,124
No. No, no. Of course not.

543
00:42:49,417 --> 00:42:54,166
Not that, but l feel bad that
Sam will never know his father.

544
00:42:54,167 --> 00:42:55,833
lf you don't love him, marry me.

545
00:42:55,834 --> 00:42:57,708
Oh, God. Stop it please.
- Marry me.

546
00:42:57,709 --> 00:42:59,249
Marriage is not a joke.

547
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:00,791
You know. You don't even know me.

548
00:43:00,792 --> 00:43:02,166
l know you well.

549
00:43:02,167 --> 00:43:03,999
You give fruit to
Roger the homeless.

550
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,208
You cut hair. You do
good deeds. You are good.

551
00:43:06,209 --> 00:43:07,708
You're okay. - Knowing
just that is not good enough.

552
00:43:07,709 --> 00:43:09,208
Yes. Yes. lt's
enough for me. Marry me.

553
00:43:09,209 --> 00:43:12,124
lt's.. - Marry me. - Oh,
God. l want to kill myself.

554
00:43:12,125 --> 00:43:14,083
Marry me. - l'm fed up.. - Oh, no,
no, no, no, no. Don't kill yourself.

555
00:43:14,084 --> 00:43:15,458
Oh, no, don't kill yourself.

556
00:43:15,459 --> 00:43:17,958
Don't die. Please, don't die.
- l'm joking.

557
00:43:17,959 --> 00:43:19,999
Please don't die.
- l was joking. - Please don't die.

558
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,624
Relax, l'm joking.
- Please don't die.

559
00:43:21,625 --> 00:43:22,999
l don't understand..

560
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,333
Mandira. Mandira.
- l was joking..

561
00:43:24,334 --> 00:43:25,791
Cable car. 1873.

562
00:43:25,792 --> 00:43:29,624
The first cable car was
started in San Francisco in 1873.

563
00:43:30,125 --> 00:43:34,416
1873. - You know you're ridiculous.
You're just ridiculous.

564
00:43:34,667 --> 00:43:37,416
l mean.. Either you are stuck in
the 'marry me, marry me' loop..

565
00:43:37,417 --> 00:43:40,166
..or you keep recounting
the history of San Francisco.

566
00:43:40,542 --> 00:43:42,249
l don't want to know. Okay?

567
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:43,999
l know everything about this city.

568
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,666
Liar. Liar.

569
00:43:45,667 --> 00:43:47,999
lt's impossible to know
everything about a city.

570
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,124
l've tried.
- Really? - Liar. Liar.

571
00:43:50,125 --> 00:43:51,499
Are you challenging me?
- Bum on fire.

572
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:52,791
Liar. Liar. - Are you
challenging me? - Bum on fire.

573
00:43:52,792 --> 00:43:54,249
Okay. You're on.
- l'm on.

574
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:55,416
You're on.
- Liar. Liar..

575
00:43:55,417 --> 00:43:59,333
lf you can show me one
place or thing in this city..

576
00:43:59,334 --> 00:44:02,666
..that l haven't seen before then..
- You'll marry me.

577
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:06,166
You'll marry me.
- Whatever.

578
00:44:06,167 --> 00:44:07,333
Whatever.
- Okay. Okay.

579
00:44:07,334 --> 00:44:09,416
You'll marry me.
- But till then..

580
00:44:09,417 --> 00:44:10,916
..you will shut your encyclopedia.
- Okay.

581
00:44:10,917 --> 00:44:12,124
And no 'marry me, marry me'.
- Okay.

582
00:44:12,125 --> 00:44:13,708
Okay.
- Okay. Whatever.

583
00:44:13,709 --> 00:44:15,291
You'll marry me.

584
00:44:16,042 --> 00:44:20,583
And you're right.. the first cable
car came to San Francisco in 1873.

585
00:44:20,584 --> 00:44:21,749
Yeah.

586
00:44:21,959 --> 00:44:25,374
And in the same year, the
first tram was started in Kolkata.

587
00:44:25,375 --> 00:44:27,874
Did you know that?
- No. You're smart.

588
00:44:27,875 --> 00:44:29,083
That l am.

589
00:44:29,084 --> 00:44:31,791
And pretty.
- That too.

590
00:44:31,792 --> 00:44:34,124
l'm pretty smart too.

591
00:44:34,459 --> 00:44:36,208
Mom. come on.

Yeah. Let me handle it.

Mrs. V, you are looking beautiful.
- You are the best.

596
00:44:43,042 --> 00:44:45,708
But you make me come
too far for my hair.

597
00:44:45,709 --> 00:44:49,208
Please accept my offer
and move to Banville.

598
00:44:49,209 --> 00:44:51,666
You are very generous,
Mrs. V, but l..

Shh about that. Sara, you tell her.

602
00:44:57,542 --> 00:44:59,958

Oh, my God. l'm so sorry.

00:45:12,625 --> 00:45:14,333
Not fair.

Mandira. Mandira, l have
made a list of places..

One minute. Just

00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,124
This list can wait.

621
00:45:30,125 --> 00:45:31,666
First, you have to
do something for me.

622
00:45:31,667 --> 00:45:33,374
Will you take Sam
to Discovery museum?

623
00:45:33,375 --> 00:45:34,749

Please, please, don't kill yourself.

637
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,624
Sam, where's your hand?

638
00:46:02,667 --> 00:46:04,083
What are you doing?

639
00:46:04,084 --> 00:46:06,208
Mom said not to let go of your hand.

640
00:46:06,209 --> 00:46:07,833
Mom is mad!

641
00:46:07,834 --> 00:46:08,999
No touching, okay?

642
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,124

But now we need one
more team. We need Team C.

00:46:22,792 --> 00:46:24,999
Now who's going to be Team C?

650
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,208
What game is this?

651
00:46:26,209 --> 00:46:28,249
Can't you see? lt's a puzzle.

652
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:30,499
This grid has names of
animals hidden in it.

653
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:36,208
The team that identifies the maximum
number of animals wins a prize.

00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:15,833
l was 22 when l divorced.

698
00:49:15,834 --> 00:49:18,624
l was only 22 years old.
- 22.

699
00:49:18,625 --> 00:49:20,333
l had nothing.

700
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:22,624
No money.

701
00:49:22,834 --> 00:49:25,041
No parental support.

702
00:49:25,459 --> 00:49:28,166
l didn't even have a house.

703
00:49:28,167 --> 00:49:29,416
Okay.

704
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,041
l had only Sam with me.

705
00:49:33,792 --> 00:49:36,166
l didn't know what the
future had in store.

706
00:49:37,542 --> 00:49:40,333
One day, as l was thinking,
l started walking.

707
00:49:41,167 --> 00:49:45,249
l walked a lot and
stopped after reaching here.

708
00:49:49,042 --> 00:49:50,458
There was no way ahead.

709
00:49:50,459 --> 00:49:52,249
Yeah, only water.

710
00:49:52,250 --> 00:49:54,416
So, l turned back.

711
00:49:56,334 --> 00:49:58,541
Saw the entire city in front of me.

712
00:50:00,334 --> 00:50:04,624
And for a minute, l felt
it was waiting for me.

713
00:50:05,917 --> 00:50:07,583
l decided then..

714
00:50:08,542 --> 00:50:12,666
No, l'm going to make this work.

715
00:50:13,125 --> 00:50:14,916
And l'm going to win.

716
00:50:15,209 --> 00:50:16,666
We shall overcome.

717
00:50:16,667 --> 00:50:17,874
We shall overcome?

718
00:50:17,875 --> 00:50:20,124
Yes! We shall overcome.

719
00:50:20,125 --> 00:50:21,791
lt's my favourite song.

720
00:50:21,792 --> 00:50:26,583
We shall overcome.
We shall overcome.

721
00:50:26,584 --> 00:50:30,958
We shall overcome. One day.

722
00:50:31,167 --> 00:50:40,416
The heart believes in it.
That we shall overcome one day.

723
00:50:40,417 --> 00:50:42,166
Oh, no, no, no, no.

724
00:50:42,167 --> 00:50:43,833
You sing badly.

725
00:50:43,834 --> 00:50:45,458
You suck. You suck.
- What?!

726
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:48,333
What?! As if you are any better!

727
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,708
You suck.

728
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:00,791
You are staring at me.

729
00:51:00,792 --> 00:51:02,041
You are staring.

730
00:51:02,334 --> 00:51:04,041
You are staring.
- Okay.

731
00:51:04,042 --> 00:51:05,458
Okay.

732
00:51:06,542 --> 00:51:09,416
Sam and l are moving
to Banville next month.

733
00:51:09,750 --> 00:51:10,999
Banville.

734
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,041
l'm opening my own salon there.

735
00:51:14,042 --> 00:51:15,208
Banvile, california.

736
00:51:15,209 --> 00:51:17,833
Population 30,000.
- Yes.

737
00:51:17,834 --> 00:51:19,958
Take me with you, Mandira.

738
00:51:20,250 --> 00:51:22,166
l'm thin, l won't need much space.

739
00:51:22,167 --> 00:51:24,458
l'll keep an eye on Sam.
l'll never let go of his hand.

740
00:51:24,709 --> 00:51:27,499
Dishwasher, microwave,
washing machine, refrigerator..

741
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:28,708
..l'll repair everything.

742
00:51:28,709 --> 00:51:31,416
Dishwasher, microwave oven,
washing machine..

743
00:51:31,417 --> 00:51:32,624
..refrigerator l'll
repair everything.

744
00:51:32,625 --> 00:51:33,749
Please take me with you.
- Khan. - No, no.

745
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:34,958
Please take me with you.
- Khan, we are getting late.

746
00:51:34,959 --> 00:51:36,541
Khan, we are getting late.
We have to go.

747
00:51:36,542 --> 00:51:37,749
Please take me with you.

748
00:51:37,750 --> 00:51:39,291
Khan, we are getting late.
- No, no please take me with you

749
00:51:39,292 --> 00:51:42,166
We have to go.
- Okay, okay

750
00:51:42,959 --> 00:51:45,458
And by the way, l
have been here before.

751
00:51:45,959 --> 00:51:47,041
Okay.

752
00:51:49,542 --> 00:51:51,374
Come on.
- Okay.

753
00:51:52,084 --> 00:51:55,416
Many things frighten me, Mandira.

754
00:51:55,750 --> 00:52:00,208
But nothing frightens me more
than the thought of losing you.

755
00:52:09,750 --> 00:52:15,291
l was scared then
and l'm scared now.

756
00:52:27,792 --> 00:52:29,874
We're full, partner, no room.

757
00:52:30,125 --> 00:52:33,083
Okay.. is there any
other motel nearby?

758
00:52:33,375 --> 00:52:36,166
Oh, you are an lndian.
l'll make some adjustments.

759
00:52:36,167 --> 00:52:39,249
You know, it's a Saturday.

760
00:52:39,542 --> 00:52:42,583
So, all the honeymoon
couples have booked my rooms.

761
00:52:42,584 --> 00:52:43,833
Saturday?

762
00:52:43,834 --> 00:52:46,208
Why? Do they marry
only on Saturdays here?

763
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:51,624
The one-night marriages..
try and understand.

764
00:52:51,625 --> 00:52:54,166
But you don't worry.
You can stay in my room.

765
00:52:54,167 --> 00:52:55,999
lt has a nude channel too!

766
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,541
Nude channel?

767
00:52:57,542 --> 00:53:00,333
The naughty and noisy channel.

768
00:53:00,334 --> 00:53:02,541
Naughty? Noisy?

769
00:53:03,584 --> 00:53:05,083
Down. Down!

770
00:53:05,084 --> 00:53:08,291
You fool. You idiot!

771
00:53:08,292 --> 00:53:10,958
l'll burn that fair
skin of yours, you idiot!

772
00:53:12,292 --> 00:53:14,333
Rascal! Rascal!

773
00:53:14,542 --> 00:53:17,041
All this is because
of the lousy Muslims.

774
00:53:17,042 --> 00:53:19,374
Six years ago, they blew
up the World Trade Centre..

775
00:53:19,375 --> 00:53:21,124
..and today, we
bear the brunt of it.

776
00:53:21,125 --> 00:53:24,458
They call forjihad (holy war) and
we have to suffer the consequences.

777
00:53:24,459 --> 00:53:28,291
And these white folk?
All blind donkeys!

778
00:53:28,292 --> 00:53:30,833
Can't you make out the difference
between a Gandhian lndian..

779
00:53:30,834 --> 00:53:34,374
..and a violent Muslim?

780
00:53:34,375 --> 00:53:35,874
Should l show you?!

781
00:53:36,125 --> 00:53:39,708
l'm going to put a board
out here: No Muslims Allowed!

782
00:53:39,959 --> 00:53:42,166
This is the fourth
glass broken by the rogues!

783
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:47,416
Don't worry, Brother. Come here.
lt's dangerous out there.

784
00:53:47,750 --> 00:53:51,166
Listen.. come back!
What's your name?

785
00:53:52,375 --> 00:53:55,583
My name is Khan, and
l'm not a terrorist.

786
00:54:02,375 --> 00:54:03,958
Thank you.

787
00:54:09,542 --> 00:54:11,708
l miss you Mandira.

788
00:54:11,709 --> 00:54:16,208
l know l can't return
before meeting the President.

789
00:54:16,209 --> 00:54:20,749
l couldn't meet him in Washington,
so, now l'm going to Santa Fe.

790
00:54:21,125 --> 00:54:23,874
One can achieve
everything by trying, Mandira.

791
00:54:24,667 --> 00:54:28,208
Like l found that place. That day.

792
00:54:33,959 --> 00:54:35,874
Yes, l'm coming, coming.

793
00:54:36,792 --> 00:54:38,124
Khan, thank God.

794
00:54:38,125 --> 00:54:39,291
Where were you all these days?

795
00:54:39,292 --> 00:54:40,458
l was so worried about you.

796
00:54:40,459 --> 00:54:41,749
You could have called.

797
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:43,374
But no, you won't.

798
00:54:43,375 --> 00:54:45,791
Cell phones are bad for bees.
- Now.

799
00:54:45,792 --> 00:54:47,541
What? But wait.

800
00:54:47,542 --> 00:54:49,791
Tell me where we are going?

801
00:54:49,792 --> 00:54:52,624
l am not dressed properly.
l don't even have my shoes.

802
00:55:03,875 --> 00:55:06,499
Here. lt's close.

803
00:55:06,959 --> 00:55:08,249
Where?

804
00:55:20,042 --> 00:55:23,583
What do you mean one minute?
- One minute.

805
00:55:23,584 --> 00:55:25,999
Keep quiet, Mandira. Quiet.
- Okay.

806
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,999
Quiet, Mandira. Quiet, quiet.
- Okay.

807
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,958
Quiet.
- Okay.

808
00:55:30,209 --> 00:55:32,416
l have been timing it for six days.

809
00:55:32,667 --> 00:55:33,999
One minute. close your eyes.

810
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,416
Close your eyes.
- Okay.

811
00:55:35,417 --> 00:55:36,583
Now, now, now, now.
- Okay.

812
00:55:36,584 --> 00:55:39,041
Close your eyes. Okay.

813
00:55:39,042 --> 00:55:42,499
Okay, okay, okay, okay

814
00:55:50,167 --> 00:55:51,833
Now, open your eyes.

815
00:55:51,834 --> 00:55:52,999
Open your eyes.

816
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,124
Open now. Now, now.

817
00:55:55,125 --> 00:55:56,958
Now, please.

818
00:56:14,792 --> 00:56:18,374
Have you seen this before?

819
00:56:26,334 --> 00:56:27,958
No.

820
00:56:34,375 --> 00:56:35,999
Khan.
- Okay.

821
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:49,583
Marry me.

822
00:56:52,125 --> 00:56:55,749
Okay.
- Marry me.

823
00:57:00,334 --> 00:57:03,541
You cannot marry her.
lt's blasphemy!

824
00:57:04,209 --> 00:57:07,291
And if you do, l will
sever all ties with you.

825
00:57:07,709 --> 00:57:09,999
You will have no place in my house.

826
00:57:11,584 --> 00:57:13,333
She is a Hindu.

827
00:57:13,334 --> 00:57:15,999
There's a lot of difference
between them and us, understood?

828
00:57:19,792 --> 00:57:22,541
No. There's no difference.

829
00:57:23,250 --> 00:57:27,249
Good people.. bad people.
There's no other difference.

830
00:57:38,750 --> 00:57:40,083
Mandira.

831
00:57:41,167 --> 00:57:42,833
Welcome.

832
00:57:42,834 --> 00:57:46,833
So, after your marriage,
will my name be Sameer Khan?

833
00:57:47,459 --> 00:57:51,083
lt will be Sameer Khan,
from the epiglottis.

834
00:57:51,084 --> 00:57:55,208
Khan.
- Yeah.

835
01:00:27,834 --> 01:00:30,291
We can't do this without touching.

836
01:00:30,292 --> 01:00:31,666
l know.
- You know.

837
01:00:31,667 --> 01:00:32,874
Yeah.

838
01:00:32,875 --> 01:00:35,999
l have read it in this book.

839
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:40,124
lntercourse for dumbos,
by Dr. Richard k. Woomer.

840
01:00:40,667 --> 01:00:42,958
Okay.
- Nice pictures.

841
01:00:47,542 --> 01:00:50,458
l think we should do it.

842
01:00:50,709 --> 01:00:54,083
Now, now we should do it now.

843
01:00:54,792 --> 01:00:57,208
One minute, and..
- Oh, no, no not one minute.

844
01:00:57,209 --> 01:00:58,624
Yeah.

845
01:00:58,625 --> 01:01:00,541
lt will take longer than one minute.

846
01:01:43,417 --> 01:01:44,999
Bye, Khan.
- Bye, Sam.

847
01:01:45,334 --> 01:01:47,916
Lunch. Lunch. Lunch. Lunch. Lunch.
- Quick, quick.

848
01:01:47,917 --> 01:01:49,208

01:01:49,209 --> 01:01:51,624
Bye! The apple of my eye!

Thank you, sweetheart.
- You're welcome, sweetheart.

852
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,708
Were you flirting with her?

853
01:02:21,417 --> 01:02:24,916
You're not a liar.
- Okay.

854
01:02:24,917 --> 01:02:27,333
Reese, l've to do my homework.
Let me go home.

855
01:02:27,334 --> 01:02:29,083
Just 10 minutes, okay.
- Only 10 minutes.

856
01:02:29,084 --> 01:02:30,249
Alright.

857
01:02:30,542 --> 01:02:32,958
Surprise.

Thank you, Daddy.

859
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:41,208
Daddy? What about me?

Happy birthday to you.

861

Mandira. Mandira, can we

862
01:02:54,375 --> 01:02:56,291
Now, now is good.

863
01:03:11,625 --> 01:03:16,249
With Allah's blessings, l
fulfilled my promise to Ammi.

864
01:03:16,667 --> 01:03:20,333
l made a happy life for myself.

865
01:03:34,167 --> 01:03:35,333
Hello.

866
01:03:37,209 --> 01:03:38,708
Yes, Sarah.

867
01:03:40,917 --> 01:03:42,166
What?

868
01:03:43,584 --> 01:03:45,416
Khan, switch on the TV, please.

869
01:03:45,417 --> 01:03:47,499
Yes, Sarah let me
call you back, okay.

870
01:03:49,042 --> 01:03:51,583
l've never seen
anything like this before..

871
01:03:51,584 --> 01:03:54,208
Oh, my God!

872
01:03:55,167 --> 01:03:59,541
A second plane.. a second
plane just hit the other tower.

873
01:04:00,542 --> 01:04:04,583
The skyline of Manhattan
has been changed forever.

874
01:04:04,584 --> 01:04:07,416
New York's twin towers are gone.

875
01:04:12,542 --> 01:04:14,624
Both towers have been hit.

876
01:04:14,625 --> 01:04:18,958
lt must've been a
coordinated attack..

877
01:04:50,125 --> 01:04:53,791
Mom, why are Reese and Mrs.
Garrick taking money from everyone?

878
01:04:53,792 --> 01:04:55,083
Donations, baby.

879
01:04:55,084 --> 01:04:59,999
For the family of the fire-fighters
who died saving people during 9/11.

880
01:05:00,834 --> 01:05:02,874
Hi.
- Hi.

881
01:05:02,875 --> 01:05:04,833
How is it going?
- Good, good.

882
01:05:04,834 --> 01:05:06,874
The Johnson's just
gave a thousand dollars.

883
01:05:06,875 --> 01:05:08,208
Wow.

884
01:05:08,209 --> 01:05:09,374
Thank you.

885
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:10,541
Oh, God.
- Here.

886
01:05:10,542 --> 01:05:12,416
3500 dollars.

887
01:05:12,792 --> 01:05:14,124
lt's annual Zakat
(religious tax) money.

888
01:05:14,125 --> 01:05:17,041
lt's a duty in lslam.
Duty, duty, duty.

889
01:05:17,042 --> 01:05:19,499
ln lslam they donate a
certain percentage of their..

890
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:21,458
..income each year in charity.
- Yes.

891
01:05:21,459 --> 01:05:23,041
This year, how could
it be anything else?

892
01:05:23,042 --> 01:05:29,166
Yes, that's $3502
and 50 cents exactly.

893
01:06:25,250 --> 01:06:31,958
ln the western world, history
is marked simply by BC and AD.

894
01:06:32,459 --> 01:06:36,958
But now, there is a
third distinction. 9/11.

895
01:06:38,959 --> 01:06:42,874
Reports are in from
various parts of America that..

896
01:06:42,875 --> 01:06:49,041
..Muslims are being
targeted and attacked.

897
01:06:50,709 --> 01:06:52,166
Back off.

898
01:06:53,125 --> 01:06:54,499
Get away.

899
01:06:57,125 --> 01:06:59,124
A Sikh employee in Michigan
was shot dead by his employer..

900
01:06:59,125 --> 01:07:00,791
..because he was
mistaken for an Afghani.

901
01:07:00,792 --> 01:07:04,624
ln the wake of 9/11, a lot of
American Muslims are changing..

902
01:07:04,625 --> 01:07:06,999
..their names to
escape racial profiling.

903
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,583
Questions are being raised
about America's biased views..

904
01:07:09,584 --> 01:07:12,249
..towards the lslamic community.

905
01:07:12,250 --> 01:07:16,041
Even as Muslim women wearing
hijabs (veils) are being targeted.

906
01:07:16,042 --> 01:07:18,708
Post 9/11, America's view
towards its lslamic inhabitants..

907
01:07:18,709 --> 01:07:20,583
..is changing rapidly.

908
01:07:27,875 --> 01:07:29,624
They must be getting late.

909
01:07:29,625 --> 01:07:31,291
Let's mom drop you today.

910
01:07:31,542 --> 01:07:33,291
And we'll grab an
ice-cream on the way. - Yeah.

911
01:07:33,292 --> 01:07:34,416
Come on.

912
01:07:35,125 --> 01:07:37,041
Of all the religions in the world..

913
01:07:37,042 --> 01:07:39,666
..lslam is the most
violent and aggressive.

914
01:07:39,875 --> 01:07:44,666
lt encourages killing or 'Jihad'
as they call it, in the name of God.

915
01:08:05,209 --> 01:08:10,374
Sam, you need to tell your
mom about this. - No, Reese.

916
01:08:10,792 --> 01:08:13,291
l think she already has
too much to worry about.

917
01:08:36,417 --> 01:08:38,124
Get out of my country.

918
01:08:55,625 --> 01:08:59,541
Don't wear this now.

919
01:09:06,417 --> 01:09:10,333
Allah will understand.
These people won't.

920
01:09:13,792 --> 01:09:15,249
Never.

921
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,083
Yes?

922
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:27,708
l'm Mandira. l heard
about Hasina, so..

923
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:33,583
She is upstairs,
bhabi (sister-in-law).

924
01:09:40,625 --> 01:09:42,416
He won't come in.

925
01:10:01,709 --> 01:10:07,458
Bhai, please come in. Please.

926
01:10:26,167 --> 01:10:33,249
You are my good son, aren't you?

927
01:10:36,167 --> 01:10:39,749
Alright, Mandira,
you'll join us on Monday.

928
01:10:41,250 --> 01:10:43,166
Thank you so much.

929
01:10:43,625 --> 01:10:45,874
l just want to clarify one thing.

930
01:10:46,584 --> 01:10:49,874
My last name is Khan,
my husband is Muslim.

931
01:10:51,625 --> 01:10:56,208
We'll see you on Monday.
- Thanks.

932
01:11:00,459 --> 01:11:04,249
Khan. l got the job, l got the job.
- Okay.

933
01:11:04,250 --> 01:11:05,458
l got the job.
- Okay.

934
01:11:05,459 --> 01:11:06,624
Now, everything will be all right.

935
01:11:06,625 --> 01:11:07,958
We'll do it. We'll do it.
- l know.

936
01:11:07,959 --> 01:11:09,083
We'll do it.
- We'll do it.

937
01:11:09,084 --> 01:11:10,708
Yes, yes, yes.
- We shall overcome?

938
01:11:10,709 --> 01:11:12,624
We shall overcome?

939
01:11:12,625 --> 01:11:17,208
We shall overcome.
We shall overcome.

940
01:11:17,209 --> 01:11:18,541
You suck.

941
01:11:18,542 --> 01:11:20,874
You suck. Please don't sing.

942
01:11:22,792 --> 01:11:28,499
We shall overcome. l know,
Mandira, we will..

943
01:11:30,292 --> 01:11:35,958
l'm in Santa Fe, New Mexico,
to meet the President.

944
01:11:39,459 --> 01:11:42,333
His motorcade has 12 cars..

945
01:11:42,334 --> 01:11:48,124
..but no one tells me
which car the President is in.

946
01:12:00,667 --> 01:12:06,958
Mandira, l don't know why, but l
keep failing to meet the President.

947
01:12:07,167 --> 01:12:09,666
But l know l have to meet him.

948
01:12:09,917 --> 01:12:12,749
l have to tell him about Sam.

949
01:12:17,459 --> 01:12:19,041
Sam. Khan.

950
01:12:19,042 --> 01:12:20,999
So there you guys are.

951
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,499
So, how was your day?

952
01:12:23,084 --> 01:12:24,374
Again Xbox?

953
01:12:25,459 --> 01:12:27,583
Make place for me,
make place for me.

954
01:12:27,959 --> 01:12:30,208
Don't hug me mom.
- come here, sweety.

955
01:12:30,209 --> 01:12:31,624
Don't hug me.

956
01:12:31,625 --> 01:12:35,541
And how are you sweetheart? - No,
no don't hug me, don't hug me, no.

957
01:12:40,167 --> 01:12:42,249
Phone.
- l know.

958
01:12:42,250 --> 01:12:44,166
But l'll be back.
- Why?

959
01:12:44,167 --> 01:12:46,291
Because you've no choice.

960
01:12:48,542 --> 01:12:51,124
Hello. Hey Sarah.

961
01:12:52,875 --> 01:12:56,541
Mark's being sent to cover
the war, in Afghanistan.

962
01:12:59,750 --> 01:13:02,624
Reese, pass Mrs. Khan the salad.

963
01:13:03,750 --> 01:13:05,999
Sam, you okay?
- Yeah, l'm fine.

964
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,041
Sarah, we are fine.

965
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:12,958
l'm fine.

966
01:13:15,834 --> 01:13:17,999
Rizvan, how is the chicken?
Do you like it?

967
01:13:18,292 --> 01:13:20,499
No, not at all.

968
01:13:23,792 --> 01:13:26,541
Did l.. did l say a joke?

969
01:13:26,875 --> 01:13:28,458
Yes you did, Rizvan.

970
01:13:28,459 --> 01:13:31,958
And a very good one indeed.
- Thank you Mark.

971
01:13:32,250 --> 01:13:34,208
But the chicken is not good.

972
01:13:34,792 --> 01:13:38,249
lt's a new recipe. l..
- Don't make it ever again.

973
01:13:40,542 --> 01:13:44,541
Mark was going to cover the
war in Afghanistan, Mandira.

974
01:13:45,584 --> 01:13:47,291
Ammi was right.

975
01:13:47,292 --> 01:13:49,541
Families are not just made by blood.

976
01:13:49,542 --> 01:13:51,374
They are made with love too.

977
01:13:51,375 --> 01:13:56,083
Sarah, Mark and Reese had
become a part of our world.

978
01:13:56,292 --> 01:14:00,291
But l never told them that..

979
01:14:00,917 --> 01:14:02,833
l should have told them.

980
01:14:28,167 --> 01:14:29,749
Take care, buddy.

981
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:34,749
See you, Reese.
- Take care, Reese.

982
01:14:37,959 --> 01:14:39,541
Hey, Reese.

983
01:14:56,792 --> 01:15:01,874
ln chapter five, verse 32 of the
Quran, Allah has decreed that..

984
01:15:02,125 --> 01:15:09,374
..the death of one innocent is
equal to the death of humanity.

985
01:15:20,042 --> 01:15:27,041
l knew that the death of
innocents in 9/11..

986
01:15:27,042 --> 01:15:29,166
..would cost the entire humanity.

987
01:15:29,584 --> 01:15:34,458
But l did not know that
you and l would have to pay..

988
01:15:34,459 --> 01:15:36,958
..the biggest price, Mandira.

989
01:15:37,292 --> 01:15:41,666
Why did this happen
to us, Mandira? Why?

990
01:15:51,209 --> 01:15:54,208
Reese. Just talk to me man.

991
01:15:54,209 --> 01:15:56,999
Wait a minute. Why are
you ignoring me, Reese?

992
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:58,416
lts been so many days since..

993
01:15:58,417 --> 01:16:00,749
Reese, listen to me. Wait a minute.

994
01:16:01,625 --> 01:16:03,583
Please listen to me man.

995
01:16:03,917 --> 01:16:06,041
What's the problem?
What have l done?

996
01:16:06,292 --> 01:16:08,166
Reese, just listen to me.
- Piss off.

997
01:16:08,167 --> 01:16:09,583
Listen to me.

998
01:16:16,375 --> 01:16:18,999
Hello. l have got new shoes for you.

Okay.

1005

Return policy, only

1006
01:16:42,417 --> 01:16:43,833
Hey.

1007
01:16:44,584 --> 01:16:48,624
l'm sorry. l shouldn't have yelled.
- Yes, very loud.

1008
01:16:48,625 --> 01:16:51,666
Very, very loud. Not nice,
not nice. - Khan.

1009
01:16:51,959 --> 01:16:53,791
Khan, please don't be angry with me.

1010
01:16:53,792 --> 01:16:55,666
l don't have any
friends apart from you.

1011
01:16:55,667 --> 01:16:57,624
Liar. Liar.

1012
01:16:57,834 --> 01:16:59,124
Reese is your friend.

1013
01:16:59,125 --> 01:17:00,291
He's your friend.
- Right.

1014
01:17:00,292 --> 01:17:02,583
You're a liar. He's your friend.

1015
01:17:02,584 --> 01:17:04,833
Cool shoes.
- Thank you.

1016
01:17:04,834 --> 01:17:06,374
Can l try them?
- No.

1017
01:17:06,375 --> 01:17:08,166
Please.
- No, please.

1018
01:17:09,084 --> 01:17:10,999
Want to play?
- No.

1019
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:12,249
l'll beat you.

1020
01:17:12,250 --> 01:17:14,541
l'll kick your butt.
- Oh, you'll kick my butt.

1021
01:17:14,542 --> 01:17:15,749
You suck.
- l suck.

1022
01:17:15,750 --> 01:17:17,208
You suck.
- No, l think you suck.

1023
01:17:17,209 --> 01:17:18,999
l'll kick your butt.
- You'll kick my butt.

1024
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:20,249
Yeah.
- Here, catch.

1025
01:17:20,250 --> 01:17:21,749
Okay, here catch.

1026
01:17:21,750 --> 01:17:24,124
Thank you, bye.
- Bye.

1027
01:17:24,125 --> 01:17:25,958
Hey, Sam.

1028
01:17:26,917 --> 01:17:30,916
Liar. Liar. Bum on fire.

1029
01:17:36,959 --> 01:17:38,999
Mom, l'm off.

1030
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,999
l'm going to school.
- Good morning.

1031
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,583
Mom, be quick.

1032
01:17:43,584 --> 01:17:45,499
Please mom. Mom l'm getting late.

1033
01:17:45,500 --> 01:17:49,416
Chill out mom.
- Don't try to be cool. - Why, dude?

1034
01:17:49,417 --> 01:17:51,541
Whatever. l'll be late today,
l have soccer practise.

1035
01:17:51,542 --> 01:17:53,749
Do you have to play soccer?

1036
01:17:53,750 --> 01:17:55,124
Do you have to cut hair?

1037
01:17:55,125 --> 01:17:56,374
Very clever.

1038
01:17:56,375 --> 01:17:59,958
The apple of my eye!
Love me till l die!

1039
01:18:01,959 --> 01:18:04,374
Sam. Sam.

1040
01:18:04,709 --> 01:18:06,666
Why is Sam walking so strangely?

1041
01:18:08,667 --> 01:18:10,458
Why are you laughing so strangely?

1042
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:14,666
You're too cute.
- No, no.

1043
01:18:14,667 --> 01:18:16,083
You're too cute.
- No, no, please, please.

No, no.

1046
01:18:19,750 --> 01:18:21,708
No, no, please.
Please, don't hug me.

1047
01:18:22,584 --> 01:18:27,291
November 27, 2007. 8:23 am.

1048
01:18:28,917 --> 01:18:33,458
l still remember the day.. That's
the last time l heard you laugh.

1049
01:18:33,459 --> 01:18:36,166
Reese. Reese.

1050
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:38,166
Reese, you haven't
spoken in eight days now.

1051
01:18:38,167 --> 01:18:39,541
What's up?
- Just leave me alone.

1052
01:18:39,542 --> 01:18:41,583
What's with you? You
know l loved your dad.

1053
01:18:41,584 --> 01:18:43,499
Just.. don't talk about my dad.

1054
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:45,708
Come on, Reese, we're best friends.
Our moms are best friends.

1055
01:18:45,709 --> 01:18:47,958
You know what you people
are nobody's best friends.

1056
01:18:47,959 --> 01:18:50,374
All you people care is about
your damn 'Jihad' or whatever.

1057
01:18:50,375 --> 01:18:51,749
What are you talking about man?

1058
01:18:51,750 --> 01:18:53,624
Reese, just listen to me.
- Just go away.

1059
01:18:53,625 --> 01:18:55,708
No, Reese, you listen..
- Shut up, and go! - Listen.

1060
01:18:55,709 --> 01:18:58,749
Sameer, l said go away.
- Listen to me man.

1061
01:18:58,750 --> 01:19:00,041
Just go away.

1062
01:19:00,042 --> 01:19:01,249
Look at those two little brats.

1063
01:19:01,250 --> 01:19:04,249
Hey, ladies, come on
time out. Come on.

1064
01:19:04,250 --> 01:19:05,708
Didn't you hear him?

1065
01:19:05,709 --> 01:19:07,249
He said "Leave him alone".

1066
01:19:07,250 --> 01:19:09,041
So why don't you go
home to your mummy.

1067
01:19:09,042 --> 01:19:12,208
Stay out of it.
- What?

1068
01:19:12,209 --> 01:19:13,833
l said, stay out of it.
- What did you say?

1069
01:19:13,834 --> 01:19:15,333
You heard me, stay out of it.

1070
01:19:17,084 --> 01:19:18,708
Jim, let him go.
- What's the matter?

1071
01:19:18,709 --> 01:19:20,374
Don't you care about your dead dad?
- Yeah, but..

1072
01:19:20,375 --> 01:19:23,041
ls Osama your lover?
- Let him go.

1073
01:19:23,042 --> 01:19:24,541
So.. dead.

1074
01:19:29,167 --> 01:19:31,458
Stop it guys, you're hurting him.

1075
01:19:32,334 --> 01:19:34,041
Oh, he liked that one.

1076
01:19:37,084 --> 01:19:38,208
What did he just do.

1077
01:19:39,167 --> 01:19:40,708
Let's get him guys.

1078
01:19:47,542 --> 01:19:49,583
Hey, Osama's son.

1079
01:19:49,584 --> 01:19:51,166
Bloody Paki.

1080
01:20:18,750 --> 01:20:22,333
Get away.

1081
01:20:30,542 --> 01:20:34,291
Screw you assholes
- What did you say?

1082
01:20:34,959 --> 01:20:36,166
Screw you.

1083
01:20:58,167 --> 01:21:00,958
Sameer. Come on buddy, get up.

1084
01:21:00,959 --> 01:21:02,124
Sameer.

1085
01:21:02,125 --> 01:21:03,749
Sameer, come on.

1086
01:21:03,750 --> 01:21:06,624
Sameer. Sameer.

1087
01:21:06,625 --> 01:21:08,916
Oh, shit.
- come on.

1088
01:21:09,542 --> 01:21:11,124
This didn't happen, okay.

1089
01:21:11,125 --> 01:21:13,583
This didn't happen
this didn't happen.

1090
01:21:13,875 --> 01:21:15,124
Or else..

1091
01:21:15,417 --> 01:21:16,874
Do you hear me?

1092
01:21:43,250 --> 01:21:44,999
Mrs. Khan. l'm detective Garcia.

1093
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,041
l need to ask you some
questions about this?

1094
01:21:47,042 --> 01:21:48,874
Later.
- Let's get him into the ER.

1095
01:21:48,875 --> 01:21:52,249

- Yes, they are..

1096
01:21:52,250 --> 01:21:54,416
Lip discoloration..
discolouration of the face.

1097
01:21:54,417 --> 01:21:55,791
How is his pulse?
- Rapid pulse.

1098
01:21:55,792 --> 01:21:59,124
Possible internal bleeding.
Possible spleen rupture.

1099
01:21:59,125 --> 01:22:01,624
What's going on?
- We got to do this fast, you guys.

1100
01:22:01,834 --> 01:22:04,124
He's losing blood. l think
we got to give him blood.

1101
01:22:04,125 --> 01:22:05,833
We got to do this fast.

1102
01:22:06,792 --> 01:22:08,374
Spleen rupture.

1103
01:22:08,959 --> 01:22:13,958
Spleen rupture. Spleen rupture.
Spleen rupture.

1104
01:22:15,584 --> 01:22:17,583
Go, go, go.

1105
01:22:17,584 --> 01:22:19,833
Ma'am, you need to stay out.

1106
01:22:23,042 --> 01:22:24,583
Okay, what've we got here,
what've we got?

1107
01:22:24,584 --> 01:22:25,958
No signs of internal bleeding.

1108
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:28,208
Give me vitals.

1109
01:22:28,209 --> 01:22:30,083
Heart is throbbing extremely low.
- Okay.

1110
01:22:30,084 --> 01:22:32,249
Okay, defib now.
- He's technicardiac.

1111
01:22:32,500 --> 01:22:34,833
Give me the defib.
- Ready for defib.

1112
01:22:34,834 --> 01:22:36,458
Okay, we're going to shock in 200.

1113
01:22:36,459 --> 01:22:37,958
Ready now.

1114
01:22:38,292 --> 01:22:39,541
Clear.

1115
01:22:40,167 --> 01:22:41,583
200.

1116
01:22:41,584 --> 01:22:47,791
One, two, three.. clear.
- Still no pulse.

1117
01:22:48,459 --> 01:22:49,833
Okay go to 300.

1118
01:22:49,834 --> 01:22:50,916
Clear.

1119
01:22:52,375 --> 01:22:54,416
Still no pulse, doctor.

1120
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:02,416
We lost him.

1121
01:23:02,917 --> 01:23:05,166
Time of death, 8:05 pm.

1122
01:23:25,584 --> 01:23:26,916
Sam.

1123
01:23:32,875 --> 01:23:34,583
Ruptured spleen.. spleen.

1124
01:23:34,584 --> 01:23:37,291
lt's the only part
of the human body..

1125
01:23:37,292 --> 01:23:39,499
..the use of which is
not known to doctors.

1126
01:23:39,875 --> 01:23:42,083
When the capsule
containing the spleen is ruptured..

1127
01:23:42,084 --> 01:23:45,041
..a splenectomy is performed,
and the spleen is removed.

1128
01:23:45,292 --> 01:23:51,624
But that can lead to
pneumococcal infection.

1129
01:23:51,625 --> 01:23:56,999
He's dead.

1130
01:24:02,417 --> 01:24:08,166
The splenic.. artery is clamped.
- Time of death, 8:05 pm.

1131
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:27,499
Time of death, 8:05 pm.

1132
01:25:11,125 --> 01:25:12,541
Sam.

1133
01:25:16,250 --> 01:25:18,291
Come back to me.

1134
01:25:21,042 --> 01:25:29,124
Come back to me, baby.

1135
01:25:33,667 --> 01:25:35,416
Don't leave me.

1136
01:25:37,667 --> 01:25:39,791
Don't leave me, please.

1137
01:25:44,209 --> 01:25:48,958
Come back to me please.
Please come back. Please.

1138
01:25:55,750 --> 01:25:58,624
Come back to me, Sam.

1139
01:25:59,584 --> 01:26:01,791
Sam, come back.

1140
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,874
Don't leave me.

1141
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:34,708
l apologise for the late hour.

1142
01:26:34,709 --> 01:26:38,833
But 48 hours is our best window
to catch the attackers. - Yeah.

1143
01:26:38,834 --> 01:26:41,541
Now, l've gone through the
medical examiner's reports.

1144
01:26:41,542 --> 01:26:44,333
The attack on your son
seems very personal Mrs. Khan.

1145
01:26:44,334 --> 01:26:46,749
lt happened at the
community soccer field.

1146
01:26:47,750 --> 01:26:51,791
lnspector Garcia told us
that our Sam's death..

1147
01:26:51,792 --> 01:26:54,083
..may have been a racial attack.

1148
01:26:54,084 --> 01:26:58,041
His wounds were proof of that.

1149
01:26:58,042 --> 01:27:01,208
He was a Muslim, so he was killed.

1150
01:27:01,209 --> 01:27:04,333
But l couldn't understand.

1151
01:27:04,334 --> 01:27:08,916
Being a Muslim is not
a bad thing, Mandira.

1152
01:27:31,917 --> 01:27:33,666
Sam.

1153
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:36,208
My baby.

1154
01:27:36,209 --> 01:27:37,458
Mandira..

1155
01:27:37,459 --> 01:27:38,916
We killed him.

1156
01:27:38,917 --> 01:27:40,166
Mandira..

1157
01:27:40,167 --> 01:27:43,958
We killed him.

1158
01:27:43,959 --> 01:27:45,166
Mandira..

1159
01:27:45,167 --> 01:27:46,999
Let's go home.

1160
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,208
We killed him.

1161
01:27:51,209 --> 01:27:52,749
lt's time for dinner.

1162
01:27:52,750 --> 01:27:53,916
Doctors say that post-traumatic
disorder causes people..

1163
01:27:53,917 --> 01:27:55,041
..to ignore their health.

1164
01:27:55,042 --> 01:27:58,666
Both of us killed him. - You
need to take care of your health.

1165
01:27:58,667 --> 01:28:00,583
Just shut up, just shut up.

1166
01:28:00,584 --> 01:28:01,916
Are you listening
to what l am saying?

1167
01:28:01,917 --> 01:28:04,624
We killed him!

1168
01:28:06,500 --> 01:28:10,041
lt's all my fault.

1169
01:28:11,125 --> 01:28:13,666
lf l hadn't married you..

1170
01:28:13,667 --> 01:28:15,458
..all this wouldn't have happened.

1171
01:28:16,959 --> 01:28:21,249
l thought you loved me so much.

1172
01:28:21,584 --> 01:28:23,333
Loved Sam so much.

1173
01:28:23,334 --> 01:28:27,749
What difference would it
make if his name is changed?

1174
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:29,583
What difference would it make..

1175
01:28:29,584 --> 01:28:31,958
..if a 'Khan' was added to his name?

1176
01:28:33,084 --> 01:28:34,999
But l was wrong.

1177
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:36,791
lt makes a difference.

1178
01:28:37,209 --> 01:28:39,166
lt does make a difference.

1179
01:28:39,167 --> 01:28:42,166
l should never have
married a Muslim man!

1180
01:28:42,750 --> 01:28:45,958
lf Sam had been a Rathod (Hindu),
he would have been alive today.

1181
01:28:45,959 --> 01:28:47,833
He was a Khan, so, he died.

1182
01:28:47,834 --> 01:28:51,083
He died because of you.
Because of your surname!

1183
01:28:52,334 --> 01:28:54,999
l don't understand
what you are saying.

1184
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:58,124
l don't understand what you
are saying. You are not well.

1185
01:28:58,125 --> 01:28:59,374
God.

1186
01:28:59,667 --> 01:29:02,416
l want to die.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

1187
01:29:02,417 --> 01:29:03,666
l want to die.

1188
01:29:03,667 --> 01:29:05,583
No, no, no Mandira please don't die.

1189
01:29:05,834 --> 01:29:09,666
No, no, please don't die.

1190
01:29:10,084 --> 01:29:12,666
You can't die. Please don't die.

1191
01:29:12,667 --> 01:29:15,666
Just leave me alone, please.

1192
01:29:15,667 --> 01:29:17,541
Leave me please.

1193
01:29:17,542 --> 01:29:19,666
l don't even want to see you.

1194
01:29:19,667 --> 01:29:23,791
Whenever l see you l
remember Sam's wounds.

1195
01:29:25,667 --> 01:29:27,124
l can't do this.

1196
01:29:28,750 --> 01:29:30,749
l can't do this anymore.

1197
01:29:31,042 --> 01:29:32,791
l'm leaving you, Khan.

1198
01:29:32,792 --> 01:29:35,124
l'm leaving you!

1199
01:29:35,125 --> 01:29:36,708
Why should you leave?

1200
01:29:36,709 --> 01:29:38,583
The house is yours. l will leave.

1201
01:29:38,584 --> 01:29:41,166
Go right now! This instant!

1202
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:43,583
Go right now.

1203
01:29:43,584 --> 01:29:47,291
Go! Go!

1204
01:29:55,542 --> 01:29:56,958
Mandira..

1205
01:30:00,250 --> 01:30:02,083
When should l come back?

1206
01:30:03,375 --> 01:30:08,833
When should you be back?

1207
01:30:09,834 --> 01:30:11,666
You know Banville?

1208
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,541
lt has a population of 30,000.

1209
01:30:14,542 --> 01:30:19,124
And each one of those
30,000 people hates you.

1210
01:30:19,125 --> 01:30:21,583
Tell all of them that
you are not a terrorist.

1211
01:30:21,584 --> 01:30:23,416
Why only them?

1212
01:30:23,417 --> 01:30:27,708
Tell every person in America.

1213
01:30:28,625 --> 01:30:31,916
Can you do that? can you?

1214
01:30:31,917 --> 01:30:33,416
No, you can't.

1215
01:30:33,417 --> 01:30:36,416
Why don't you tell the
President of United States then?

1216
01:30:36,834 --> 01:30:41,749
Mr. President, my name is
Khan and l'm not a terrorist.

1217
01:30:42,667 --> 01:30:44,833
So, he can tell all these people..

1218
01:30:45,084 --> 01:30:48,958
..that my Sam was not the
terrorist son of a terrorist father.

1219
01:30:49,375 --> 01:30:51,499
He was just a baby.

1220
01:30:52,875 --> 01:30:54,666
My baby.

1221
01:30:57,875 --> 01:30:59,749
When you do that..

1222
01:31:01,084 --> 01:31:02,916
..come back.

1223
01:31:04,042 --> 01:31:05,958
Come back then!

1224
01:31:14,500 --> 01:31:27,333
Mr. President, my name is
Khan and l'm not a terrorist.

1225
01:31:27,625 --> 01:31:34,791
My name is Khan and
l'm not a terrorist.

1226
01:31:34,792 --> 01:31:37,041
Not a terrorist.

1227
01:32:47,792 --> 01:32:52,624
Mandira, l felt a stab of pain
in my chest when l left you.

1228
01:32:52,625 --> 01:32:55,499
l thought it was chest congestion.

1229
01:32:55,500 --> 01:33:00,749
But no amount of gingerjuice
could make the pain go away.

1230
01:33:01,209 --> 01:33:02,458
lt's still there.

1231
01:36:57,625 --> 01:37:01,958
Bhabhi, whatever you
said then was said in anger.

1232
01:37:02,417 --> 01:37:04,833
lt was Sam's grief
that made you say it.

1233
01:37:05,292 --> 01:37:07,958
We all know you love him a lot.

1234
01:37:08,167 --> 01:37:11,583
Then why don't you.. - There is no
space for love in my life right now.

1235
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:13,916
Love will weaken me.

1236
01:37:14,417 --> 01:37:16,874
Hate will help me fight this battle.

1237
01:37:17,250 --> 01:37:19,666
And l have to fight for Sam.

1238
01:37:20,292 --> 01:37:22,958
l can't be Khan's wife right now.

1239
01:37:23,792 --> 01:37:27,249
l'm just a mother
whose son has been killed.

1240
01:37:39,334 --> 01:37:42,374
l've had a long day, and
l've sold enough tickets.

1241
01:37:42,834 --> 01:37:45,916
l'll have to call you back, alright.

1242
01:37:48,417 --> 01:37:51,749
For dinner with the
president is $500 you know.

1243
01:37:56,209 --> 01:37:59,291
That's.. that's 500.

1244
01:38:01,542 --> 01:38:04,833
What church are you from?
- Church? Church?

1245
01:38:05,500 --> 01:38:08,083
This is a Christian's only event.

1246
01:38:08,084 --> 01:38:12,958
But.. but it says, it's a fund
raiser for the draught in Africa.

1247
01:38:13,334 --> 01:38:14,708
For christians, honey.

1248
01:38:14,959 --> 01:38:18,666
Honey, Honey keep it.

1249
01:38:20,167 --> 01:38:22,208
For those are not
Christian in Africa.

1250
01:38:25,292 --> 01:38:28,749
Honey. Honey, feed Africa.

1251
01:38:43,042 --> 01:38:44,749
Offer it to him as well?

1252
01:38:48,417 --> 01:38:50,874
Excuse me, would you
like to have some?

1253
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:39,041
What's your name?
- Rizvan Khan. Khan.

1254
01:39:39,917 --> 01:39:42,833
l'm lmran and this is Sajida.

1255
01:39:44,709 --> 01:39:45,999
Where are you off to?

1256
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:47,541
lt's time for the bus to leave.

1257
01:39:47,792 --> 01:39:49,249
Prayer time.

1258
01:39:49,250 --> 01:39:50,999
Prayer time?

1259
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,124
Now? Here?

1260
01:39:54,542 --> 01:39:58,708
You should pray depending upon
the place and the people around.

1261
01:40:01,250 --> 01:40:04,416
No. No, no.

1262
01:40:05,792 --> 01:40:08,249
Prayer should never depend
upon the place or the people.

1263
01:40:08,250 --> 01:40:10,499
lt should depend
only on your belief.

1264
01:41:50,667 --> 01:41:52,208
My God, my knee.

1265
01:41:52,209 --> 01:41:54,333
Oh my God, my knee is bleeding.

1266
01:41:56,125 --> 01:41:59,999
l'm sorry, but l
can't repair your knee.

1267
01:42:00,292 --> 01:42:03,958
But can you at least
help me please. - Help?

1268
01:42:05,417 --> 01:42:07,833
Oh, yes l can do that.

1269
01:42:08,584 --> 01:42:10,041
Okay, thanks.

1270
01:42:10,459 --> 01:42:12,583
Joel, that better be you.

1271
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:16,541
Hello.

1272
01:42:16,959 --> 01:42:18,916
You are an angel.

1273
01:42:18,917 --> 01:42:20,124
You've saved my baby.

1274
01:42:20,125 --> 01:42:22,291
He could've been out
there lying, bleeding.

1275
01:42:22,292 --> 01:42:23,708
Oh, thank you, thank you.

1276
01:42:23,709 --> 01:42:26,874
You little frisky thing,
aren't you? - Please don't hug me.

1277
01:42:26,875 --> 01:42:28,833
Alright.
- That's my Mama Jenny.

1278
01:42:28,834 --> 01:42:31,999
Always trying to hug everyone.
- Mama Jenny, please don't hug me.

1279
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:37,999
Joel lzale Williams. l told
you not take that bicycle out.

1280
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,749
Now off to bed with you.
- Yes, ma'am.

1281
01:42:40,750 --> 01:42:43,958
You. You Mr. Repair man.
- Rizvan.

1282
01:42:43,959 --> 01:42:47,166
Rizvan. Oh, you hungry child?
You want little dinner?

1283
01:42:47,167 --> 01:42:49,333
No, l want lots of dinner.

1284
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,041
First we've got to get
you out of those clothes.

1285
01:42:54,042 --> 01:42:57,374
You want me to be naked?
- No, no, no.

1286
01:42:57,375 --> 01:42:59,916
Just get this
cleaned up, that's all.

1287
01:42:59,917 --> 01:43:03,999
Funny hair Joel and his
Mama Jenny are good people.

1288
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,958
Mama Jenny is strict
and a little fat too.

1289
01:43:07,209 --> 01:43:09,458
But l like her.

1290
01:43:20,042 --> 01:43:21,999
Mama Jenny's elder son, James..

1291
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:25,958
..was killed two
months ago in the lraq war.

1292
01:43:28,917 --> 01:43:31,291
But he loved his country.

1293
01:43:33,209 --> 01:43:37,166
Mama Jenny too
asked me about Sameer.

1294
01:43:37,500 --> 01:43:40,916
Sam has been gone for 179 days..

1295
01:43:40,917 --> 01:43:45,708
..and for the first time,
someone made a mention of him to me.

1296
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:57,249
Poor baby.

1297
01:44:00,459 --> 01:44:04,041
Mama Jenny and Funny Hair
Joel live in Wilhemina..

1298
01:44:04,042 --> 01:44:06,541
..Tarrow County, Georgia.

1299
01:44:08,250 --> 01:44:15,458
This small town has 204
people and 754 cows exactly.

1300
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:21,541
All the people here
work at the dairy farm.

1301
01:44:21,542 --> 01:44:25,124
And pray at the church Of Rock.

1302
01:44:29,500 --> 01:44:35,499
Today, there's a memorial service
for all the soldiers killed in lraq.

1303
01:44:39,959 --> 01:44:45,041
Mama Jenny has added Sameer's
name to the list of martyrs.

1304
01:44:47,500 --> 01:44:53,083
Mama Jenny said by
remembering and talking about them..

1305
01:44:53,084 --> 01:44:55,874
..we can get closer to them.

1306
01:44:55,875 --> 01:44:57,958
Letters just stopped.

1307
01:44:58,625 --> 01:45:02,124
My mom's never been the same,
she cries all the time.

1308
01:45:03,209 --> 01:45:05,999
l loved my brother so much,
and l just want him to know..

1309
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,499
..if he's out there,
that l miss him.

1310
01:45:08,875 --> 01:45:09,999
He's always..

1311
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:16,249
l too tried to get closer to Sam.

1312
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:20,499
Sameer Rathod Khan, my son.

1313
01:45:20,959 --> 01:45:25,333
Weight 56 kilogram,
blood group O positive.

1314
01:45:25,584 --> 01:45:28,249
Sameer loved Xbox and soccer.

1315
01:45:28,250 --> 01:45:32,874
He loved his soccer shoes so
much that he would sleep in them.

1316
01:45:32,875 --> 01:45:35,583
That was the only bad habit he had.

1317
01:45:35,584 --> 01:45:38,874
Sam was six years old
when l married his mother.

1318
01:45:38,875 --> 01:45:41,166
Sameer was a good son.

1319
01:45:41,167 --> 01:45:46,833
He did not mind sharing
his mom's love with me.

1320
01:45:47,167 --> 01:45:51,999
But l couldn't be
such a good dad to him.

1321
01:45:52,792 --> 01:45:57,999
Other dads sense their children's
unsaid needs and fulfil them.

1322
01:45:58,375 --> 01:46:02,374
But l can't sense
unexpressed feelings.

1323
01:46:02,375 --> 01:46:04,833
So, l couldn't fulfil them.

1324
01:46:05,584 --> 01:46:08,583
But.. but, Sam never complained.

1325
01:46:08,584 --> 01:46:11,749
He never complained.

1326
01:46:13,417 --> 01:46:15,708
Sam had one more bad habit.

1327
01:46:15,709 --> 01:46:17,499
He told us only good things.

1328
01:46:17,750 --> 01:46:19,833
He always hid bad news from us.

1329
01:46:21,125 --> 01:46:23,041
He would never tell me
when my favorite..

1330
01:46:23,042 --> 01:46:24,833
..team Manchester United lost.

1331
01:46:24,834 --> 01:46:26,249
Never.

1332
01:46:26,459 --> 01:46:29,958
Unless we had a bet.
Then he would tell me.

1333
01:46:30,292 --> 01:46:35,833
Then l would l have to give him
his mint chocolate-chip ice cream.

1334
01:46:36,917 --> 01:46:38,749
Two scoops.

1335
01:46:39,542 --> 01:46:41,458
Two scoops, always.

1336
01:46:45,209 --> 01:46:46,666
Two scoops.

1337
01:46:47,417 --> 01:46:50,374
On 27th November 2007,
he was killed.

1338
01:46:52,292 --> 01:46:55,166
He was 13 years, nine
months and four days old.

1339
01:46:56,792 --> 01:47:00,583
Sameer was not only my son,
he was my dearest friend.

1340
01:47:00,584 --> 01:47:03,791
Actually, my only friend.

1341
01:47:03,792 --> 01:47:05,291
My..

1342
01:47:05,792 --> 01:47:10,666
My.. only best friend.

1343
01:47:18,750 --> 01:47:22,416
l'm sure Allah is happy that
Sam is with him in heaven.

1344
01:47:22,709 --> 01:47:30,416
l.. Mama Jenny, l
don't know what to say.

1345
01:47:31,500 --> 01:47:36,166
l don't want to say anymore.

1346
01:48:12,709 --> 01:48:14,583
Come on, Rizvan.

1347
01:49:53,042 --> 01:49:54,499
Okay.
- Okay.

1348
01:49:54,500 --> 01:49:55,999
Bye.

1349
01:49:56,959 --> 01:49:59,333
Bye, Rizvan.
- Bye.

1350
01:49:59,334 --> 01:50:00,958
Bye.
- Bye.

1351
01:50:00,959 --> 01:50:03,124
Okay, okay bye.

1352
01:50:03,125 --> 01:50:05,541
God bless you, my son.

1353
01:50:06,459 --> 01:50:08,666
What do you mean
you're shutting the case?

1354
01:50:09,042 --> 01:50:11,041
Understand it's been six months.

1355
01:50:11,042 --> 01:50:13,666
Okay, no witnesses, no suspects,
no evidence.

1356
01:50:13,667 --> 01:50:16,166
There's been no movement
on this case, Mrs. Khan.

1357
01:50:16,167 --> 01:50:17,958
Look, l really have no choice.

1358
01:50:17,959 --> 01:50:20,291
But you know, maybe.. maybe
there's somebody at school..

1359
01:50:20,292 --> 01:50:21,499
..who will remember something.

1360
01:50:21,500 --> 01:50:23,708
You know, maybe you can go
door to door, class to class.

1361
01:50:23,709 --> 01:50:25,458
Door to door and homes,
and something..

1362
01:50:25,459 --> 01:50:27,999
You know l've done that already.
- But, you know..

1363
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:29,624
Maybe there's something
else that you'll find.

1364
01:50:29,625 --> 01:50:30,999
You see these files?

1365
01:50:31,375 --> 01:50:33,791
These are all those
waiting forjustice too.

1366
01:50:34,417 --> 01:50:36,749
Look, l'm sorry,
Mrs. Khan. l truly am.

1367
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,999
Sometimes there really
are no answers. - No.

1368
01:50:40,584 --> 01:50:42,624
l don't accept that.

1369
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,166
l do not accept that.

1370
01:50:45,167 --> 01:50:47,458
There has to be an answer.

1371
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:51,833
And if you can't find it, l will.

1372
01:51:15,542 --> 01:51:16,958
Hi.
- Hi.

1373
01:51:16,959 --> 01:51:19,624
l'm looking for any lead on
the boys who killed my son.

1374
01:51:19,875 --> 01:51:23,083
Any information at all. My
number is there. - Okay.

1375
01:51:36,375 --> 01:51:38,833
l have reached Los Angeles now.

1376
01:51:39,917 --> 01:51:43,958
The President is coming
visit the college campus here.

1377
01:51:48,625 --> 01:51:50,999
l have reached
three days before him..

1378
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,791
..so that l don't miss
him this time around.

1379
01:51:59,167 --> 01:52:02,624
l am going to pray that
Allah wills it so too.

1380
01:52:12,667 --> 01:52:15,166
Listen, listen, listen brothers.

1381
01:52:15,625 --> 01:52:17,666
We are digressing.

1382
01:52:18,084 --> 01:52:20,333
l have said it before.

1383
01:52:20,875 --> 01:52:25,249
l have no problem with
Christians or the Jews.

1384
01:52:26,375 --> 01:52:30,458
ln fact, l have no problems
with our Hindu brothers too.

1385
01:52:30,917 --> 01:52:36,583
l treat a lot of Hindu
patients in St. Benedict's hospital.

1386
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:40,333
l get angry only
when this same grace..

1387
01:52:40,334 --> 01:52:42,791
..is not
reciprocated towards us Muslims.

1388
01:52:43,042 --> 01:52:45,458
My blood boils..

1389
01:52:45,459 --> 01:52:52,166
..when lsraeli Jews
massacre our Palestinian brothers.

1390
01:52:52,667 --> 01:52:54,291
Or when Hindus in lndia..

1391
01:52:54,292 --> 01:52:57,583
..cut our women and children
to pieces with their swords.

1392
01:52:57,875 --> 01:53:02,374
That's when my blood boils.

1393
01:53:02,667 --> 01:53:05,208
Doesn't your blood boil? Answer me.

1394
01:53:05,209 --> 01:53:06,999
Doesn't your blood boil?
- lt does. lt does.

1395
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:08,458
lt does. lt does.

1396
01:53:08,459 --> 01:53:11,833
So, do something then. Do something!

1397
01:53:13,584 --> 01:53:18,749
l, Dr. Faisal Rehman,
take an oath that l'm ready.

1398
01:53:18,750 --> 01:53:19,999
Are you people ready? Are you?

1399
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:21,208
Yes, we are. Yes. Yes, we are.

1400
01:53:21,209 --> 01:53:24,124
Are you people ready?

1401
01:53:24,125 --> 01:53:27,541
Yes, we are. Yes. Yes, we are.

1402
01:53:31,417 --> 01:53:37,708
Mighty Allah had even asked
lbrahim to sacrifice his son.

1403
01:53:39,542 --> 01:53:46,458
And without asking a single question,
lbrahim agreed to sacrifice him.

1404
01:53:47,375 --> 01:53:50,666
lt's our turn today.

1405
01:53:50,667 --> 01:53:55,041
lt's our duty to let our blood
flow for the cause of lslam.

1406
01:53:55,292 --> 01:53:56,958
This is what Allah demands!

1407
01:53:57,250 --> 01:54:01,166
This is what lslam demands!

1408
01:54:01,167 --> 01:54:05,583
No, no, no, no.

1409
01:54:05,875 --> 01:54:07,249
No.

1410
01:54:07,792 --> 01:54:10,749
You are lying.

1411
01:54:11,125 --> 01:54:12,874
Wait.. Wait..

1412
01:54:13,125 --> 01:54:14,624
Why, brother?

1413
01:54:15,125 --> 01:54:18,208
Don't you believe that the Lord
had asked for lsmail's sacrifice?

1414
01:54:18,209 --> 01:54:19,999
No, no.

1415
01:54:21,375 --> 01:54:23,208
My Ammi has told me the story.

1416
01:54:24,125 --> 01:54:29,124
Saint lbrahim did not doubt
the compassion of the Lord.

1417
01:54:29,125 --> 01:54:31,666
No, no, no. No.

1418
01:54:32,334 --> 01:54:35,624
The story is an example of his
immense strong faith and belief.

1419
01:54:36,292 --> 01:54:37,666
And that's the reason..

1420
01:54:38,792 --> 01:54:41,791
..why despite being incited
by a stranger repeatedly..

1421
01:54:42,625 --> 01:54:45,666
..Saint lbrahim did not waver
from his path of righteousness.

1422
01:54:45,667 --> 01:54:46,999
No.

1423
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,083
He didn't listen to the stranger.

1424
01:54:49,084 --> 01:54:53,708
He was sure Allah would never allow
the blood of his progeny to be shed.

1425
01:54:54,917 --> 01:54:56,458
And he was right.

1426
01:54:57,417 --> 01:55:01,583
The mighty Allah
saved lsmail's life.

1427
01:55:02,334 --> 01:55:06,166
My Ammi also said, "Rizvan..

1428
01:55:07,667 --> 01:55:13,833
..this story shows that the
path ofAllah is that of love..

1429
01:55:13,834 --> 01:55:19,041
..not of hatred and war."

1430
01:55:21,542 --> 01:55:23,333
You are lying.

1431
01:55:23,334 --> 01:55:27,374
Dr. Faisal Rehman is a liar.
- You are lying.

1432
01:55:27,375 --> 01:55:28,666
Look. The meaning of
the story is clear.

1433
01:55:28,667 --> 01:55:32,708
Dr. Faisal Rehman is a liar.
- Our brother here speaks the truth.

1434
01:55:32,709 --> 01:55:34,499
Allah's path is that of compassion.

1435
01:55:34,500 --> 01:55:36,874
That's why his loved ones are called
'blessed by the compassionate! '

1436
01:55:36,875 --> 01:55:40,374
Dr. Faisal Rehman is a liar.
Ask him who was that stranger?

1437
01:55:40,375 --> 01:55:41,499
l'm not lying!

1438
01:55:41,500 --> 01:55:42,749
You are lying!

1439
01:55:42,750 --> 01:55:44,708
Our times demand..
- Ask him..

1440
01:55:44,709 --> 01:55:47,749
The stranger who tried to
veer lbrahim from his path..

1441
01:55:47,750 --> 01:55:48,958
..was he an infidel?

1442
01:55:48,959 --> 01:55:50,083
How does it matter who he was?

1443
01:55:50,084 --> 01:55:51,458
But Doctor, who was he?

1444
01:55:51,459 --> 01:55:53,458
Listen l can explain everything.

1445
01:55:53,459 --> 01:55:56,708
Brother, tell us who he was.

1446
01:56:03,250 --> 01:56:09,166
Satan! Satan! Satan!

1447
01:56:25,459 --> 01:56:27,541
The world is strange, Mandira.

1448
01:56:27,542 --> 01:56:32,958
The more l try to understand
it the lesser l understand.

1449
01:56:33,667 --> 01:56:36,124
l miss you.

1450
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,416
Hello.
- Hello.

1451
01:56:42,875 --> 01:56:45,708
Bhai.. You? Where are you?

1452
01:56:46,459 --> 01:56:49,958
FBl. Do you have a
number for the FBl?

1453
01:56:50,417 --> 01:56:52,833
FBl? Why?

1454
01:57:20,375 --> 01:57:21,708
Please.

1455
01:57:21,709 --> 01:57:23,208
lt's our college, and
they are pushing us around.

1456
01:57:23,209 --> 01:57:25,666
l wonder why they are so excited.
That too for this President.

1457
01:57:25,667 --> 01:57:27,833
Lousy pods of garlic!

1458
01:57:28,375 --> 01:57:29,833
l love it.

1459
01:57:29,834 --> 01:57:33,958
There are no better cusswords
than lndian ones. - Really.

1460
01:57:44,042 --> 01:57:46,291
Boys and girls.

1461
01:57:46,292 --> 01:57:49,583
Come on. This is the man
you waited for hours to see.

1462
01:57:49,584 --> 01:57:52,124
Let's give him a
warm round of applause.

1463
01:57:52,125 --> 01:57:55,833
l present to you,
the man, the legend.

1464
01:57:55,834 --> 01:57:59,249
The president of the
United States of America.

1465
01:58:00,792 --> 01:58:03,041
Alright, yes.

1466
01:58:07,167 --> 01:58:08,916
Alright, come on everybody.

1467
01:58:08,917 --> 01:58:12,583
Let's give this guy a nice
warm round of applause..

1468
01:58:12,584 --> 01:58:14,791
..for his esteemed support.

1469
01:58:17,292 --> 01:58:18,624
And there he is.

1470
01:58:18,625 --> 01:58:20,791
Alright everybody, alright.

1471
01:58:20,792 --> 01:58:23,708
Everybody, make some noise.

1472
01:58:23,709 --> 01:58:25,208
President.

1473
01:58:27,209 --> 01:58:40,333
Mr. President.

1474
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:48,208
My name Khan, and
l'm not a terrorist.

1475
01:58:54,334 --> 01:58:56,541
Mr. President.

1476
01:58:57,542 --> 01:59:00,833
My name Khan, and
l'm not a terrorist.

1477
01:59:01,667 --> 01:59:03,333
Did he just say terrorist?

1478
01:59:03,334 --> 01:59:05,499
l'm not a terrorist.
- Terrorist!

1479
01:59:05,500 --> 01:59:09,458
He says he's a terrorist.
- l'm not a terrorist.

1480
01:59:17,292 --> 01:59:19,124
Move.

1481
01:59:40,542 --> 01:59:42,124
Don't move.

1482
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:44,708
l got him.

1483
01:59:58,625 --> 02:00:00,583
Don't move, man. Don't move.

1484
02:00:00,584 --> 02:00:03,958
Keep your hands
where l can see them.

1485
02:00:08,084 --> 02:00:11,541
My name is Khan, and
l'm not a terrorist.

1486
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:13,624
l don't understand.

1487
02:00:14,250 --> 02:00:16,041
He is strange.

1488
02:00:16,625 --> 02:00:18,583
First, he was standing silently.

1489
02:00:18,875 --> 02:00:20,124
Then all of a sudden,
he was screaming.

1490
02:00:20,125 --> 02:00:21,374
And what was he screaming..

1491
02:00:21,375 --> 02:00:24,791
l'm not a terrorist. l'm
not a terrorist. Strange.

1492
02:00:24,792 --> 02:00:26,833
There's something more to his story.

1493
02:00:27,084 --> 02:00:29,416
Yes. But why are
we after this story?

1494
02:00:29,792 --> 02:00:32,083
Listen, Raj. This
can't be our project.

1495
02:00:32,084 --> 02:00:35,083
l don't want to get into
this Khan story. l'm scared.

1496
02:00:35,084 --> 02:00:36,958
Scared because he is a Khan?

1497
02:00:37,625 --> 02:00:39,458
lf he was a Khanna,
you wouldn't be, right?

1498
02:00:39,459 --> 02:00:40,958
What do you mean?

1499
02:00:41,292 --> 02:00:43,208
You know what l'm saying, Komal.

1500
02:00:45,667 --> 02:00:48,041
Listen, this is
going to be my project.

1501
02:00:48,375 --> 02:00:50,249
Are you with me?

1502
02:00:54,834 --> 02:00:57,124
He's been following the
President for some weeks now.

1503
02:00:57,125 --> 02:01:00,666
And we.. frankly can't know
whether he's a 'Jihadi' or not.

1504
02:01:02,417 --> 02:01:04,999
l have made a
mistake again, Mandira.

1505
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:08,124
And now, the
President is angry with me.

1506
02:01:08,125 --> 02:01:10,624
He has even told the judge about it.

1507
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:15,374
That's why the judge has
asked me to be shut away.

1508
02:01:26,709 --> 02:01:31,124
He has also ordered that l
should meet a psychiatrist.

1509
02:01:31,125 --> 02:01:34,833
He says he will meet me after that.

1510
02:01:34,834 --> 02:01:39,083
l will tell him then
that l'm not an enemy.

1511
02:01:39,084 --> 02:01:40,791
l'm not evil.

1512
02:01:40,792 --> 02:01:43,958
l am unable to say
anything now, Mandira.

1513
02:01:45,625 --> 02:01:48,541
l'm very scared.

1514
02:01:54,459 --> 02:01:57,166
His name is Rizvan Khan.
- Rizvan Khan. - Yes.

1515
02:01:57,167 --> 02:01:58,624
They are not saying
anything beyond that right now.

1516
02:01:58,625 --> 02:02:01,208
l knew the police wasn't
going to tell us anything.. Now?

1517
02:02:01,209 --> 02:02:04,291
Now what? There are
other ways of finding out.

1518
02:02:04,500 --> 02:02:05,874
Come on, let's go.

1519
02:02:07,167 --> 02:02:08,916
Guys, you know this is illegal.

1520
02:02:08,917 --> 02:02:11,583
Yes. And you never do
anything illegal, right?

1521
02:02:13,875 --> 02:02:16,666
Here. complete
information on Rizvan Khan.

1522
02:02:16,667 --> 02:02:18,624
House, work address,
social security number.

1523
02:02:18,625 --> 02:02:21,249
Credit records, salary statement.
ln short, his entire life!

1524
02:02:21,250 --> 02:02:23,999
Wow, dude, lnder you're a rockstar.
- Yes, thanks.

1525
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:25,458
Bye.
- Okay, okay, okay.

1526
02:02:25,459 --> 02:02:26,916
Stay out ofjail.

1527
02:02:27,125 --> 02:02:28,833
Yeah, l'll call you back. Bye.

1528
02:02:28,834 --> 02:02:31,499
Yeah, l'm telling you, it's a
great piece for your paper, okay.

1529
02:02:31,500 --> 02:02:33,416
This man, Rizvan Khan,
is a simple guy.

1530
02:02:33,417 --> 02:02:35,208
He sells beauty
products for a living.

1531
02:02:35,209 --> 02:02:36,458
Listen.

1532
02:02:36,459 --> 02:02:37,791
He's no enemy combatant.

1533
02:02:37,792 --> 02:02:38,999
That's what you think.

1534
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:41,749
l just interviewed an extremist
in a Kabul prison last year.

1535
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,958
He was just a tailor.
There's no story here, bud.

1536
02:02:49,959 --> 02:02:52,208
This place is strange, Mandira.

1537
02:02:52,209 --> 02:02:56,791
There are no windows to any room
and the bathrooms don't have a door.

1538
02:02:57,042 --> 02:03:00,083
And the toilet has a lock.

1539
02:03:02,625 --> 02:03:06,041
My eyes burn and l feel sleepy too.

1540
02:03:07,709 --> 02:03:10,333
At times, it's very hot here.

1541
02:03:10,334 --> 02:03:12,333
At other times, it is very cold.

1542
02:03:12,334 --> 02:03:16,458
l told them l would
repair their air conditioner..

1543
02:03:16,917 --> 02:03:18,791
..but they won't let me.

1544
02:03:20,459 --> 02:03:23,416
They don't even tell me
the time so that l can pray.

1545
02:03:23,417 --> 02:03:25,999
That's why every
time l feel scared..

1546
02:03:26,292 --> 02:03:29,416
l bow and pray.

1547
02:03:30,250 --> 02:03:32,958
Oh, sorry guys, sorry.
Give me two minutes, okay.

1548
02:03:32,959 --> 02:03:34,833
Look, l've looked over the details.

1549
02:03:34,834 --> 02:03:36,458
l'm not really interested, but..

1550
02:03:36,459 --> 02:03:38,291
..why don't you try
Bobby Ahuja, at PBC.

1551
02:03:38,292 --> 02:03:41,083
He might able to
help you. Okay. Alright.

1552
02:03:41,375 --> 02:03:43,999
But why? Why do you want
to meet the President?

1553
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,499
Why do you know so
much about the President?

1554
02:03:46,500 --> 02:03:49,083
Why were you reading
up on the President?

1555
02:03:49,375 --> 02:03:51,208
Do you know these people?

1556
02:03:51,209 --> 02:03:53,583
Azhar Mahmood, Omar Khan..

1557
02:03:53,584 --> 02:03:55,916
l think they are angry..

1558
02:03:55,917 --> 02:03:59,708
..because l'm not able to answer
their questions about the Al Qaeda.

1559
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,999
But l don't know
anything about them.

1560
02:04:03,292 --> 02:04:07,791
Mandira, l should have
read up on Al Qaeda before.

1561
02:04:07,792 --> 02:04:11,583
Why? Why were you at
the Rally? Okay, what?

1562
02:04:13,209 --> 02:04:15,291
lt's time for his session with me.

1563
02:04:15,625 --> 02:04:17,583
As ordered by the judge.

1564
02:04:18,334 --> 02:04:22,374
Do you really buy this, "My wife
told me to meet the President" shit?"

1565
02:04:22,375 --> 02:04:24,499
Would it matter if l said yes?

1566
02:04:26,042 --> 02:04:27,208
Hello.
- Hi.

1567
02:04:27,209 --> 02:04:30,374
Raj.
- Raj, Bobby Ahuja. Please sit.

1568
02:04:33,375 --> 02:04:37,041
l didn't have your number or l
would have called to tell you that..

1569
02:04:37,042 --> 02:04:40,083
..l can't cover the
Rizvan Khan story.

1570
02:04:40,084 --> 02:04:42,208
l have a busy schedule.

1571
02:04:42,625 --> 02:04:45,416
l have no time for
another two months.

1572
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,958
You know otherwise, you know
l would've done something.

1573
02:04:48,959 --> 02:04:51,666
But.. you know what l mean?

1574
02:04:51,667 --> 02:04:54,208
lf you don't mind me asking, sir.

1575
02:04:54,625 --> 02:04:57,666
Was this photograph
taken before 9/11?

1576
02:04:59,542 --> 02:05:01,499
Yes. Why?

1577
02:05:04,084 --> 02:05:05,291
What's so funny?

1578
02:05:05,292 --> 02:05:09,333
No, it's not funny at all actually.

1579
02:05:10,542 --> 02:05:14,333
They confused a Sikh for a Muslim
and you changed your entire life.

1580
02:05:15,459 --> 02:05:18,499
And here, they are not even
treating a Muslim like a human..

1581
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:20,666
..and you aren't able
to change your schedule?

1582
02:05:23,334 --> 02:05:25,166
Thank you for your time, sir.

1583
02:05:36,375 --> 02:05:38,791
You have one new message.

1584
02:05:38,792 --> 02:05:41,958
Hi Raj, this is
Bobby Ahuja from PBC.

1585
02:05:42,167 --> 02:05:44,208
Don't forget to
watch the news tomorrow.

1586
02:05:45,792 --> 02:05:48,999
My name is Khan, and
l'm not a terrorist.

1587
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:50,583
Mr. President.

1588
02:05:50,584 --> 02:05:52,916
Rizvan Khan of Banville
California was arrested..

1589
02:05:52,917 --> 02:05:55,999
..on June 15th at the
CLA Presidential Rally.

1590
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:57,541
He has been accused
of being a terrorist..

1591
02:05:57,542 --> 02:05:59,499
..and has been jailed
for the last 15 days.

1592
02:05:59,500 --> 02:06:00,999
Without any evidence.

1593
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:03,208
And without legal representation.

1594
02:06:03,209 --> 02:06:06,499
And today, we have with us Mr.
and Mrs. Zakir Khan.

1595
02:06:06,500 --> 02:06:07,833
Family of Rizvan Khan.

1596
02:06:07,834 --> 02:06:10,791
lmran, the Khan from the bus is
on PBC. Quick, switch on the TV!

1597
02:06:10,792 --> 02:06:13,374
Very angry and very upset.

1598
02:06:14,209 --> 02:06:16,791
l mean, how can anyone
call him a terrorist?

1599
02:06:17,834 --> 02:06:19,541
That too without any evidence.

1600
02:06:19,542 --> 02:06:22,958
Tell them how last month
Bhai called for the FBl.

1601
02:06:23,459 --> 02:06:26,708
Bhai had called last month.
He wanted the number for the FBl.

1602
02:06:26,709 --> 02:06:31,208
He wanted to report some terrorist
recruiter called, Dr. Faisal Rehman.

1603
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:35,499
Yo, how's business, asshole?

1604
02:06:36,167 --> 02:06:37,874
Fuck you.

1605
02:06:38,167 --> 02:06:41,166
l mean we're told to
report suspicious characters.

1606
02:06:41,167 --> 02:06:43,999
Participate in.. protecting
the country from extremists.

1607
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:45,874
And then when we do that..

1608
02:06:45,875 --> 02:06:48,499
..we're just put into
the jail, like my brother.

1609
02:06:48,500 --> 02:06:51,916
Yeah, this is judge Preston,
can you give me the FBl please?

1610
02:06:52,250 --> 02:06:55,666
The question over here is, not why
he's trying to meet the President.

1611
02:06:55,667 --> 02:06:57,708
The question is, what's
wrong in an ordinary citizen..

1612
02:06:57,709 --> 02:06:59,833
..wanting to meet the
President of his country?

1613
02:07:00,459 --> 02:07:04,166
Or is itjust wrong for
a Muslim man to even try?

1614
02:07:06,500 --> 02:07:09,791
And as Rizvan Khan
continues to be treated as guilty..

1615
02:07:09,792 --> 02:07:14,916
..until proven innocent, for
PBc News, my name is Bobby Ahuja.

1616
02:07:15,292 --> 02:07:16,958
And l'm not a terrorist.

1617
02:07:16,959 --> 02:07:19,249
He is right. Zakir Bhai is right.

1618
02:07:19,959 --> 02:07:24,583
We are told to report to the
government any information..

1619
02:07:24,584 --> 02:07:27,624
..we have on any terrorist activity.

1620
02:07:28,250 --> 02:07:31,874
And when we do that,
what happens is before you.

1621
02:07:32,125 --> 02:07:35,249
Why is this being
asked over and over again?

1622
02:07:35,250 --> 02:07:37,958
"Why does Khan want to
meet the President?"

1623
02:07:38,292 --> 02:07:43,208
What's the harm if an ordinary
citizen wants to meet the President?

1624
02:07:43,209 --> 02:07:44,833
What's wrong?

1625
02:07:44,834 --> 02:07:48,583
Or then tell us clearly that
Muslims don't have right to do so.

1626
02:07:51,292 --> 02:07:53,624
Yes, good afternoon.
This is Tracy Brennan..

1627
02:07:53,625 --> 02:07:56,999
..Chairperson of the American
Autistic society in San Francisco.

1628
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:59,791
Would you put me on to your
officer in-charge of the..

1629
02:07:59,792 --> 02:08:01,999
..Rizvan Khan case, please?

1630
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,499
This is about the Rizvan Khan case.

1631
02:08:04,875 --> 02:08:07,999
Any information you
have on Rizvan Khan.

1632
02:08:08,250 --> 02:08:09,916
Look l've been calling all morning.

1633
02:08:09,917 --> 02:08:13,249
l need to know where Rizvan
Khan has been taken, please.

1634
02:08:16,584 --> 02:08:17,916
Hello, hello.

1635
02:08:17,917 --> 02:08:21,124
My name is Rizvan Khan.
Khan, from the epiglottis.

1636
02:08:21,125 --> 02:08:23,458
l want to report a man.

1637
02:08:23,459 --> 02:08:25,374
l have to report a man.

1638
02:08:25,375 --> 02:08:29,333
l met him at a downtown mosque.

1639
02:08:29,334 --> 02:08:31,874
His name is Dr. Faisal Rehman.

1640
02:08:31,875 --> 02:08:35,083
Faisal Rehman, he works at
the St. Benedicts Hospital.

1641
02:08:35,084 --> 02:08:36,999
He is a bad man.

1642
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:39,458
He is a very bad man.

1643
02:08:41,167 --> 02:08:44,249
Your call helped
them arrest Dr. Rehman.

1644
02:08:44,500 --> 02:08:46,958
Eight others were arrested with him.

1645
02:08:47,834 --> 02:08:50,208
lt's a big catch, Rizvan.

1646
02:08:50,209 --> 02:08:51,999
You are free to go now.

1647
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:53,999
You are free.

1648
02:09:12,209 --> 02:09:13,749
Hey, watch it.

1649
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:23,166
Finally, Rizvan Khan's
innocence has been proved.

1650
02:09:23,542 --> 02:09:26,249
He will be freed in a few moments.

1651
02:09:26,667 --> 02:09:28,041
A small, but increasing
group of supporters..

1652
02:09:28,042 --> 02:09:29,916
..have gathered here today..

1653
02:09:29,917 --> 02:09:31,958
..and have shown
no signs of leaving.

1654
02:09:31,959 --> 02:09:36,666
Bano, come quickly! Rizvan Khan
has been released. He's been freed.

02:09:58,209 --> 02:10:00,749

02:10:00,750 --> 02:10:03,291
..innocence and what not.
- Crazy lady. Mandira.

1661
02:10:03,667 --> 02:10:05,041
Mandira was here.

1662
02:10:05,542 --> 02:10:07,541
Crazy lady, Mandira was here.

1663
02:10:07,542 --> 02:10:11,499
Where did she go?

1664
02:10:11,834 --> 02:10:13,999
Where did she go?
- She went out the back way.

1665
02:10:21,792 --> 02:10:33,416
Mandira.

1666
02:11:36,417 --> 02:11:39,791
Sorry Mandira, l couldn't meet you..

1667
02:11:40,125 --> 02:11:42,874
..since l haven't
fulfilled my promise to you yet.

1668
02:11:46,709 --> 02:11:50,958
But somehow Mandira,
as soon as l saw you..

1669
02:11:51,334 --> 02:11:53,958
..the pain in my chest vanished.

1670
02:11:58,375 --> 02:12:00,208
Where did Rizvan Khan go?

1671
02:12:00,375 --> 02:12:03,416
And why does he want to meet
the President? No one knows.

1672
02:12:03,750 --> 02:12:05,541
So why he wants to
meet the President..

1673
02:12:05,542 --> 02:12:08,749
..and what is his message about
continues to remain a mystery.

1674
02:12:08,959 --> 02:12:10,999
This is Bobby Ahuja, PBC news.
- Yeah, so..

1675
02:12:11,334 --> 02:12:13,083
Thank you so much for
this internship, sir.

1676
02:12:13,084 --> 02:12:14,458
We promise not to let you..

1677
02:12:14,459 --> 02:12:16,666
Thank me later..
First find this Khan..

1678
02:12:16,959 --> 02:12:19,416
His story has moved
thousands of Muslims.

1679
02:12:20,209 --> 02:12:22,249
l wish l knew where Bhai was, Raj.

1680
02:12:22,417 --> 02:12:23,708
He calls me.

1681
02:12:24,959 --> 02:12:28,249
Yeah. Yeah, next time he
calls me l'll let you know.

1682
02:12:32,750 --> 02:12:34,249
Yo, Paki loser.

1683
02:12:44,209 --> 02:12:46,708
Hey! My name is Abdul!

1684
02:12:48,125 --> 02:12:50,166
You want a piece of me.

1685
02:12:51,459 --> 02:12:53,541
You show me the finger?
- Enough, okay buddy.

1686
02:12:53,750 --> 02:12:56,124
Come, l'll show you once
and for all. - l'm done.

02:12:56,125 --> 02:12:57,249
Come l'll show you!

1688
02:12:58,000 --> 02:12:58,999
What you looking at?

1689
02:13:17,542 --> 02:13:22,291
For a while now l have
been fighting with myself.

1690
02:13:22,709 --> 02:13:28,166
l teach you about identity when my
own has been changed so drastically.

1691
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:33,666
My hijab is notjust
my religious identity.

1692
02:13:35,959 --> 02:13:39,833
lt is a part of my existence.

1693
02:13:42,375 --> 02:13:44,458
Khan stayed in room 22 only.

1694
02:13:45,167 --> 02:13:46,874
You want to stay in the same room?

1695
02:13:47,209 --> 02:13:51,333
Only 25 dollars extra,
to be a part of history.

1696
02:13:52,250 --> 02:13:55,374
And mind you, my name is Jitesh.

1697
02:13:55,750 --> 02:13:57,749
And l'm not a terrorist.

1698
02:13:58,709 --> 02:14:00,958
Mummy, l want to tell
you something today.

1699
02:14:01,875 --> 02:14:04,124
Today l'm proud to
be a computer hacker.

1700
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:07,416
Ya.. l have eaten already.

1701
02:14:07,584 --> 02:14:09,041
At least listen to
what l'm saying first.

1702
02:14:18,334 --> 02:14:24,374
Hurricane Molly.. now
moving at 125 miles per hour..

1703
02:14:24,375 --> 02:14:26,458
..has severely hit
the southern coast.

1704
02:14:26,459 --> 02:14:29,083
And the authorities around the
southern region have been alerted.

1705
02:14:29,250 --> 02:14:32,041
We now go live to Alex,
who's on location.

1706
02:14:32,209 --> 02:14:33,374
Thank you, Janice.

1707
02:14:33,375 --> 02:14:34,749
Attention all passengers..

1708
02:14:35,084 --> 02:14:38,291
..E- 52 bus to Portland has
been delayed by 10 minutes.

1709
02:14:38,292 --> 02:14:41,583
Again, E-52 Portland bus
has a ten minute delay.

1710
02:14:41,584 --> 02:14:42,958
We regret the inconvenience.

1711

We have a fresh update,

1714
02:14:51,292 --> 02:14:53,208
Full on by hurricane Molly.

1715

At this point we don't

1716
02:14:56,959 --> 02:15:04,166
Mama Jenny.. Mama
Jenny l have to go to her.

1717
02:15:18,584 --> 02:15:22,291
Raj.. Bhai called.. You wanted
to know where he was, didn't you?

1718
02:15:22,500 --> 02:15:23,749
Yes, Zakir bhai?

1719
02:15:23,750 --> 02:15:25,249
He's going to Wilhemina.

1720
02:15:25,250 --> 02:15:30,041
Wilhemina? That's in Georgia, right?

1721
02:15:30,042 --> 02:15:31,416
Ya.. Somewhere there.

1722
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:33,124
What is he doing there?

1723
02:15:33,125 --> 02:15:35,166
He said that he has to
meet some Mama Jenny there.

1724
02:16:07,750 --> 02:16:12,083
Mandira, there's going to be a
delay in meeting the President.

1725
02:16:13,709 --> 02:16:15,708
l have come to Wilhemina, Georgia.

1726
02:16:16,125 --> 02:16:20,124
Mama Jenny and Funny
hair Joel are in trouble.

1727
02:16:20,500 --> 02:16:23,124
There's too much
water here, Mandira..

1728
02:16:23,542 --> 02:16:27,249
..and l don't think
Mama Jenny can swim.

1729
02:16:27,459 --> 02:16:29,749
She's a little fat.

1730
02:17:26,167 --> 02:17:28,458
Rizvan. Mama Rizvan.

1731
02:17:29,125 --> 02:17:32,874
Rizvan. What are you doing here?

1732
02:17:33,459 --> 02:17:40,166
Mama Jenny, l'm happy, Funny
hair Joel and you are not dead.

1733
02:17:40,167 --> 02:17:41,833
l'm happy.

1734
02:17:44,584 --> 02:17:46,666
Thank you for coming, Rizvan.

1735
02:17:47,209 --> 02:17:50,624
But you should not be here.
- l'm happy, l'm here.

1736
02:17:50,625 --> 02:17:51,791
No, you must go.

1737
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:53,874
No, you must go.
- No, no, no.

1738
02:17:53,875 --> 02:17:55,208
Listen to me.
- No, no, no.

1739
02:17:56,375 --> 02:17:57,749
You should not be here.

1740
02:17:58,125 --> 02:18:01,333
This one you cannot repair. Now go.

1741
02:18:16,667 --> 02:18:18,124
Mama, Rizvan.

1742
02:18:22,292 --> 02:18:24,624
Oh, God the church is going to fall.

1743
02:18:24,625 --> 02:18:25,958
We're going to die.

1744
02:18:26,417 --> 02:18:28,041
The church is going to fall.

1745
02:19:19,334 --> 02:19:22,749
Hadith says that the Almighty
does notjudge by color or creed..

1746
02:19:22,750 --> 02:19:24,083
..but by actions and deeds.

1747
02:19:24,084 --> 02:19:25,291
lf that is the truth..

1748
02:19:25,292 --> 02:19:27,333
..then Rizvan Khan by the
sheer force of his actions..

1749
02:19:27,334 --> 02:19:30,083
..has elevated the entire
humanity in the eyes of God.

1750
02:19:31,459 --> 02:19:33,708
Just recently this
man was arrested..

1751
02:19:33,709 --> 02:19:36,749
..and tortured for being an
enemy combatant of this country.

1752
02:19:37,584 --> 02:19:39,999
Wonder what the government
officials would call this..

1753
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:41,958
..Muslim enemy combatant today?

1754
02:19:42,292 --> 02:19:45,833
As he selflessly tries to save
the remaining lives in Wilhemina.

1755
02:19:45,834 --> 02:19:48,333
Just a few days ago this
man was called a terrorist..

1756
02:19:48,334 --> 02:19:49,833
..and tortured mercilessly.

1757
02:19:49,834 --> 02:19:52,041
Today we wait for the response
of the government officials..

1758
02:19:52,375 --> 02:19:55,916
..as he tirelessly
strives to save innocent lives.

1759
02:19:55,917 --> 02:19:57,999
lf the authorities want
to find the true enemy..

1760
02:19:58,000 --> 02:19:59,416
..combatant of this country.

1761
02:19:59,709 --> 02:20:03,374
Then they would find it in the
grief and debris of Wilhemina.

1762
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:06,499
lt's a long journey
to change the world.

1763
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:11,708
But the first few steps have been
taken by Rizvan Khan in Wilhemina.

1764
02:20:13,292 --> 02:20:16,083
lsn't it our duty now to
take this journey forward?

1765
02:20:16,875 --> 02:20:18,708
Raj Burman, Star News.

1766
02:20:29,375 --> 02:20:35,624
Please don't take my
baby away from me.

1767
02:20:37,875 --> 02:20:41,583
Mandira, people are suffering
here and are very helpless.

1768
02:20:42,542 --> 02:20:46,541
l wish l could take
all of them from here.

1769
02:20:46,875 --> 02:20:49,041
But l don't have the
physical strength to do that.

1770
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:54,083
Mama Jenny is right..

1771
02:20:54,625 --> 02:20:57,958
This one.. this one l can't repair.

1772
02:21:01,375 --> 02:21:04,874
Now we can only await
the Lord's merciful eye.

1773
02:21:12,584 --> 02:21:18,541
Mama! Mama!

1774
02:22:15,209 --> 02:22:17,333
While several hurricane hit areas..

1775
02:22:17,334 --> 02:22:19,499
..have suffered from
government inaction.

1776
02:22:19,500 --> 02:22:23,333
One small town in Georgia is
slowly getting back on its feet.

1777
02:22:24,042 --> 02:22:26,749
This group has brought
something more valuable than money.

1778
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:28,374
They brought themselves.

1779
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:31,333
The US government may
have forgotten the flood..

1780
02:22:31,334 --> 02:22:33,083
..inflicted area of Wilhemina,
Georgia..

1781
02:22:33,084 --> 02:22:35,041
..but one man has
refused to be indifferent..

1782
02:22:35,042 --> 02:22:37,124
..to the plight of its inhabitants.

1783
02:22:37,292 --> 02:22:39,833
This one man has spared
no efforts in helping..

1784
02:22:39,834 --> 02:22:43,041
..rehabilitate the
population ofWilhemina.

1785
02:22:43,875 --> 02:22:46,374
Looking at him as an
inspiration today..

1786
02:22:46,375 --> 02:22:49,083
..many Americans have
rushed to Wilhemina..

1787
02:22:49,084 --> 02:22:53,291
..and its neighboring towns to help
in rebuilding the destroyed towns.

1788
02:22:53,500 --> 02:22:56,208
And all this just
because of one man..

1789
02:22:56,209 --> 02:22:58,499
..whose name is Rizvan Khan..

1790
02:22:58,500 --> 02:23:02,083
..and who, in his own words,
is not a 'terrorist'..

1791
02:23:13,292 --> 02:23:15,041
Following the example of Wilhemina..

1792
02:23:15,042 --> 02:23:17,208
..towns are being
adopted across the country.

1793
02:23:17,584 --> 02:23:19,708
And while our military
is tied up in lraq..

1794
02:23:19,709 --> 02:23:21,374
..reconstruction of these towns..

1795
02:23:21,584 --> 02:23:24,333
..has been taken on
by ordinary Americans.

1796
02:23:24,584 --> 02:23:28,208
And today, as our
special guest from Wilhemina..

1797
02:23:28,209 --> 02:23:30,083
..we have the man, who
got the whole ball rolling.

1798
02:23:30,375 --> 02:23:31,874
Mr. Rizvan Khan.

1799
02:23:32,125 --> 02:23:36,166
Oh no, no, no it's Khan.
- Excuse me.

1800
02:23:36,167 --> 02:23:38,416
Khan.
- Excuse me.

1801
02:23:38,750 --> 02:23:39,999
Khan.
- One minute.

1802
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:41,958
From the epiglottis, ma'am. Khan.

1803
02:23:42,459 --> 02:23:43,624
l'm sorry, Rizvan.

1804
02:23:44,084 --> 02:23:46,708
Maybe you could tell us why
you want to meet the president?

1805
02:23:47,417 --> 02:23:50,541
Senator, you need to take a look
at these campaign accounts. - Later.

1806
02:23:50,542 --> 02:23:51,583
l want to watch this.

1807
02:23:52,792 --> 02:23:54,749
My beautiful wife, Mandira.

1808
02:23:55,709 --> 02:24:02,708
She.. she told me to go and
meet the President of America.

1809
02:24:03,125 --> 02:24:06,458
A long tiring journey,
Rizvan. What kept you going?

1810
02:24:06,459 --> 02:24:09,208
My son's soccer shoes.

1811
02:24:09,459 --> 02:24:14,583
My son Sam, and his best friend
Reese, they they love playing soccer.

1812
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:25,124
l'm sorry Mrs. Khan,
l didn't know what to do.

1813
02:24:25,125 --> 02:24:27,833
And l was scared. And
they threatened hurt me.

1814
02:24:27,834 --> 02:24:29,166
And l'm sorry.

1815
02:24:29,167 --> 02:24:31,708
l'm just really, really sorry.

1816
02:24:31,709 --> 02:24:37,208
l'm sorry Mrs..
- Sorry is not good enough.

1817
02:24:39,209 --> 02:24:41,208
That's just not good enough.

1818
02:25:15,625 --> 02:25:17,499
Thank you for asking
for leniency for me.

1819
02:25:20,459 --> 02:25:23,041
l didn't do it for you,
l did it for your mom.

1820
02:25:24,500 --> 02:25:25,874
My mom won't forgive me.

1821
02:25:27,667 --> 02:25:29,999
She will. She's a mom.

1822
02:26:10,209 --> 02:26:12,583
Mandira, this is Sarah.

1823
02:26:13,292 --> 02:26:14,458
Thanks.

1824
02:26:14,459 --> 02:26:16,624
Thank you for Reese.

1825
02:26:18,459 --> 02:26:20,458
And l hope and pray that
Sam's soul rests in peace.

1826
02:26:23,584 --> 02:26:28,666
Mandira, we both know what it
feels like to lose people we love.

1827
02:26:29,125 --> 02:26:31,833
l lost my husband to hate.

1828
02:26:31,834 --> 02:26:33,624
Don't lose Rizvan.

1829
02:26:33,875 --> 02:26:40,458
Let go of your anger, just let go.

1830
02:26:53,792 --> 02:26:54,999
l love you son.

1831
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:13,458
Zakir, Hasina.

1832
02:27:14,084 --> 02:27:15,416
l'm leaving now.. Bye, bye.

1833
02:27:15,625 --> 02:27:18,458
Bhai why do you have to
leave so late at night?

1834
02:27:18,792 --> 02:27:20,541
l've to go now.

1835
02:27:20,542 --> 02:27:22,291
lt is three days to the
Presidential election.

1836
02:27:22,625 --> 02:27:23,874
After that the
President will change.

1837
02:27:23,875 --> 02:27:25,583
l have to meet him before that.

1838
02:27:25,750 --> 02:27:27,958
Now, l need to meet
him now. Now, now.

1839
02:28:44,084 --> 02:28:45,708
Leave me!

1840
02:28:45,875 --> 02:28:48,874
You got Dr. Rehman arrested!

1841
02:28:49,125 --> 02:28:52,083
You are an infidel! This
is your punishment, Khan!

1842
02:28:52,459 --> 02:28:54,249
This is your punishment!
You have to die!

1843
02:28:54,792 --> 02:28:56,499
lslam will never forgive you!

1844
02:28:56,750 --> 02:28:57,999
Leave me!

1845
02:28:58,417 --> 02:29:01,374
Oh Lord!!

1846
02:29:01,750 --> 02:29:05,499
The United States of
America has a new President.

1847
02:29:05,500 --> 02:29:06,749
Doctor, he just got up.

1848
02:29:06,750 --> 02:29:08,708
Let me check all
his vitals, lets go.

1849
02:29:47,792 --> 02:29:50,874
There are only two kinds
of people in this world.

1850
02:29:53,709 --> 02:29:56,708
He died because of you.
Because of your surname!

1851
02:29:58,792 --> 02:30:00,166
Leave me alone.

1852
02:30:00,917 --> 02:30:03,374
Go right now! This instant!

1853
02:30:03,375 --> 02:30:05,874
Go now, now.

1854
02:30:08,167 --> 02:30:09,833
When should l come back, Mandira?

1855
02:30:52,459 --> 02:30:55,499
l.. l didn't die, Mandira.

1856
02:30:57,709 --> 02:31:00,999
No, you didn't.

1857
02:31:03,750 --> 02:31:07,166
Can l get a hug, please?

1858
02:31:07,667 --> 02:31:08,874

l love you too.

1861
02:31:33,292 --> 02:31:35,958
Today the President elect visits
flood inflicted Georgia State.

1862
02:31:36,417 --> 02:31:38,624
The question is
whether Rizvan Khan..

1863
02:31:38,625 --> 02:31:42,916
..who has just been discharged from
the hospital will get to meet him.

1864
02:31:43,250 --> 02:31:48,166
Khan has refused to go back home
until he meets the President elect.

1865
02:31:48,334 --> 02:31:49,833
Raj Burman.. Star News.

1866
02:31:51,500 --> 02:31:53,874
Khan.. let's go home. You
don't need to do this now.

1867
02:31:53,875 --> 02:31:55,083
No, no, no.

1868
02:31:55,084 --> 02:31:57,291
Why?
- No, no, no.

l have to meet the President.

1870
02:32:00,417 --> 02:32:05,416
Ammi had said, "A Khan
always keeps his word!"

1871
02:32:07,917 --> 02:32:11,958
Folks, we'll make sure
we do everything we can..

1872
02:32:11,959 --> 02:32:14,374
..to bring Georgia back on its feet.

After offering aid to
the state of Georgia..

United Nations' special summit.

02:32:46,125 --> 02:32:48,333
The President has left. Please.

1883
02:32:48,334 --> 02:32:49,541

for all his efforts in Wilhemina..

1886
02:32:56,000 --> 02:32:57,958
..is now at the Governor's mansion.

1887
02:32:59,750 --> 02:33:03,708
He has been trying to meet
the President for a while now.

1888
02:33:03,709 --> 02:33:08,416
lt's sad that he won't
meet the President even today.

1889
02:33:08,417 --> 02:33:10,916
Rizvan Khan's supporters are
quite dejected at this prospect.

1890
02:33:10,917 --> 02:33:14,374
However it looks like he'll face
disappointment all over again.

1891
02:33:14,917 --> 02:33:17,499
A disappointed group
of Khan's supporters..

1892
02:33:17,500 --> 02:33:19,708
..are getting ready to turn back.

1893
02:33:21,500 --> 02:33:23,166
Copy that, Regal is on foot.

1894
02:33:24,375 --> 02:33:26,874

02:35:33,875 --> 02:35:35,083
Sam..

1915
02:35:36,042 --> 02:35:40,499
Our Khan has managed to achieve,
with his love and humanity..

1916
02:35:41,125 --> 02:35:42,999
..what my hatred
could never achieve.

1917
02:35:44,167 --> 02:35:45,916
My anger threw us apart..

1918
02:35:46,917 --> 02:35:50,374
..but today his love has
brought us together in a way..

1919
02:35:50,917 --> 02:35:54,166
..where we remember
you with renewed hope.

1920
02:36:03,292 --> 02:36:05,749
Now l will never let
him go anywhere, Sam.

1921
02:36:06,792 --> 02:36:09,124
l will keep this love with me..

1922
02:36:10,750 --> 02:36:15,833
For me.. For you.. Forever!
