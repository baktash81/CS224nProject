Hello there.
My name is Robert White.
And I'm Joseph Young.

27
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:03,505
And we're with the Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
Who?.

28
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:07,280
Let me ask you a question.
What would you say
if someone offered you...

29
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:09,287
peace and happiness
through all of eternity?.

30
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:12,017
Fuck off!

31
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:18,123
Thank you.
Have a nice day.

Yeah, baby.

33
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:30,709
You make me so horny.

34
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:33,803
Oh, I want it so bad.

35
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:40,717
I bet you do.
And I'm gonna give it to you.

36
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:44,655
Oh, good. 'Cause I'm
so badly wanting it.

- I'm not a stud.
- Huh?.

00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:28,595
Somebody, save me.

51
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:39,141
You can't defeat me, Orgazmo!

52
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:41,271
Oh, yeah, I can too.

53
00:04:41,347 --> 00:04:44,316

an attractive little garden here.
- Why, thank you, young man.

59
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:07,664
I just planted those flowers last week.
My, how they grow!

Take that book of Mormon and shove it so
far up your righteous asses that you choke,

What is your problem, Zazinsky?.

00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:06,562
He blocked. He wasn't supposed to block,
and he broke my finger.

79
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:08,862
You told me you knew how to fight.

80
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:11,096
Orgazmo's supposed to be a badass.

81
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:13,195
He shouldn't block me then!

82
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:15,206
Get back in there...

83
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:19,267
and look tough,
you fucking pansy!

84
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:22,803
I can't.
My finger is broke.

You listen to me,
you cocky prick!

Hey, where are you and Lisa
gonna have the wedding?.

89
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,198
Well, of course, Lisa wants
to get married in the temple...

90
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:45,601
in Salt Lake City,
but it costs a lot of money.

91
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:48,731
I don't think I can afford it.
Yeah, I know what you mean.

92
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:51,800
I don't know why the church makes it
so expensive to have a wedding there.

93
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:55,109
Hey, don't worry. If you really
want something to happen,

94
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:57,479
the Heavenly Father will
probably make it happen.

95
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,484
Yeah.
Yeah.

96
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:02,282

Oh, no. Help.

98
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,085
No one's gonna help
you now, honey!

Well, why didn't you say so?
Come on in!

143
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,698

"I say untoyou, 'Nay, they are many.

Yea, and we can witness
of their sincerity,

146
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:11,032
because of their love towards their
brethren, and also towards us. "

spoke to prophets...

148
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:15,780
right here

00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:18,214
Yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah.
I dig that Jesus guy.

150
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:22,084
You do?.
Oh, sure. The kids love him.

00:10:22,154 --> 00:10:24,987
Happy Tart?.
Oh, thank you.

152
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:28,359
Listen, kid.
Mmm.

153
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:31,055
[Clears Throat]
Have you ever considered acting?.

154
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:35,499
Me? Oh, yes. Actually,
I majored in theater at B.Y.U.

155
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:37,399
Go on.
Yeah.

156
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,405
Are you making a movie here?.
Yeah.

157
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:44,170
And I want you to take over
as the leading man in my film.

158
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:46,336
Me?

159
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:50,315
Really? Well, wow.

160

I still have another week
of mission work to do, but--

161
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:58,588
Well, what kind of movie is it?.
It's an action/adventure porno.

162
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:03,494
Porno? Like as in pornographic?

163
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:07,089
Well, yeah, but it's not like that.
Oh.

164
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:10,158
Oh, I don't do those--
those kind of movies.

165
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:14,696
Look, kid. It's two days' work,
and I'll give you $5,000.

166
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:17,607
Hey, you were only giving me 300.
How's your finger,
Chechechez?

167
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,237
I think it's better.
I'm ready to go.
Yeah?

168
00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:23,247
- Ow!
- That certainly is a lot of money,

169
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:25,340
but I'm afraid
it goes against my beliefs.

170
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:27,682
Thank you very mu--
Look, kid.

171
00:11:27,753 --> 00:11:32,053
You got me all wrong.
This is not your average porno.

172
00:11:32,124 --> 00:11:34,615
This is a very touching script.

173
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:38,391
It's a poignant story about
some very important issues.

174
00:11:39,598 --> 00:11:42,396
But are there people having intercourse?

175
00:11:42,468 --> 00:11:44,402
Well, this is an adult film.

176
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,597
Well, see, I can't do that.

177
00:11:46,672 --> 00:11:49,766
All right. Make it $7,000.

178
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:53,141
It's very nice of you to offer me
so much money, but--

179
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,146
Ten thousand.

180
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:57,478
I can't. See, I have a fiancée.
And if she ever--

181
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,916
I got it.
We'll use a stunt cock.

182
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:04,183
Anytime there's actual penetration,
we'll bring in another penis.
We do it all the time.

183
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:08,283
All you have to concern yourself with
is the crime fighting and the acting.

184
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:13,931
But see, I'd still be acting
in a pornographic movie.
And that's what I--

185
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:18,095
Twenty thousand dollars.
Excuse me?

186
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:19,831
Twenty thousand dollars? Are you crazy?

187
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:22,465
Twenty thousand dollars
for two days' work?

188
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:25,066
And you don't even have to fuck.

189
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:31,074
I have to think about this.
Can I think about this?

190
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:34,017
Sure. We'll start first thing
Monday morning.

191
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:36,111
Well, I have to think about this.
Yeah.

192
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:38,122
You start at 10:00.

193
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:40,317
I'm gonna think about this now.

194
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:43,452
I don't know. He doesn't seem much
like the porno type to me, boss.

195
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:45,827
That's why he's so perfect for Orgazmo.

196
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:48,230
He's so prissy and wholesome.

197
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,632
You watch. In a couple of weeks,

198
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:54,195
I'll make that little mama's boy
the biggest porn star in the country.

199
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:02,380

201
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,951
Hello?
Hi, Lis.

202
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:15,687
Hi, honey.
How are things in Utah?

203
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:19,288
Utah isn't as nice without you,
that's for sure. How are things there?

204
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:21,560
Oh, fine.

205
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:25,570
I, uh-- I had an interesting day.
I got offered a part in a movie.

206
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:29,802
A movie? Like a Hollywood movie?

207
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:34,710
Yeah, and it pays a lot.
Oh, Joe. That's wonderful.

208
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,873
Is it enough so that we can
get married in the temple?

209
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:39,577
Lisa, it's $20,000.

210
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,643
[Screams]

211
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,053
[Chuckling]

212
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:47,217
Oh, you're the best, Joe.

213
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:51,354
Well, I don't know
if I'm gonna do it, Lis.
What? Why not?

214
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:56,094
There are some things in the movie
that are against God's way.

215
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:59,626
Joe, even if movies are
a little crude now and then,

216
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:03,937
I think that the Lord understands that
you need money for your family's future.

217
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:09,504
Twenty thousand dollars
would get us off to a great start.
I know it would.

218
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:12,745
So what is it?
What are you acting in?
Oh.

219
00:14:12,818 --> 00:14:16,015
Uh, it's, uh,

220
00:14:16,088 --> 00:14:20,115
Death of a Salesman.
Oh, let me guess.
You're playing Biff, right?

221
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:22,683
Biff, yeah.
[Chuckles]

222
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:26,060
[Horn Honks]
Daddy's here to take me
to choir practice, Joe.

223
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:28,565
Can I call you back later?
Sure, sure.

224
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:32,695
Jesus and I love you, Joe.
Jesus and I love you too, Lis.

225
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:35,205
Bye.
Bye.

226
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:46,445
Heavenly Father,
please show me the way.

227
00:14:46,518 --> 00:14:50,318
I know it would be sinful to act
in a movie that had sexual activity,

228
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:53,449
but Lisa is so important to me.

229
00:14:53,525 --> 00:14:57,427
And I need the money for
our wedding and for a place to live.

230
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:03,125
Please, just give me a sign
if you don't want me to do it.

[Car Alarms Blaring]

234
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:19,116
Any sign at all.

235
00:15:22,187 --> 00:15:25,020
Where is that little fucking choir boy?

236
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,752
I don't think he's gonna show up.
Oh, really?

237
00:15:27,826 --> 00:15:32,661
Rodgers, you and pickle dick here
go find that bastard.

238
00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:35,359
And you tell him
if he doesn't act in my film,

239
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:38,801
his parents, his friends,
his fuckin' pets are gonna pay!

240
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:42,307
You tell him
if he fucks with me, he'll be--
[Door Opens]

241
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:44,501
Well, hello.

242
00:15:45,577 --> 00:15:48,978
Hello.
We were just talking about you.
How are you?

243
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:53,109
I'm fine.
Super. Why don't you
go get into wardrobe,

244
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:55,551
and we'll get started right away.

245
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,851
Orbison, who am I fucking
in this scene?

246
00:15:57,923 --> 00:16:00,585
Uh, you'll be fucking
Jeff and probably Ben.

247
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:03,321
Have you met our new
Orgazmo?
No.

248
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:05,625
Hi, how do you do?
Hi, are we fucking?

249
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:08,963
No. You'll be fucking
his stunt cock.

250
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:12,367
And I'm not doing any ass-licking today.
I told you that, right?

251
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:15,339
Yes, yes. No ass-licking.
Okay.

252
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:20,403
I'm not an ass-licker.
Give 'em an inch,
they take a mile.

253
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,606
[No Audible Dialogue]

254
00:16:22,681 --> 00:16:25,275
Oh, what was I thinking?

255
00:16:25,351 --> 00:16:29,014
There you are. Get in here. Come on.
Just get in here and put this on.

256
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:31,613
Put it on.
Just put it on now.
Uh, okay. Can I--

257
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:34,853
Oh.
So you must be the new Orgazmo.

258
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:38,920
No, I-- Maybe. My name's Joe.

259
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,398
Ben Chapleski.
I play Choda Boy.

260
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:44,265
What's a Choda Boy?
I'm your sidekick.

261
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:47,032
My sidekick? I have a sidekick?
Yeah.

262
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:49,040
What do--
[Yells]

263
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:53,903
Uh, I didn't know I had a sidekick.
Didn't they even tell you the plot?

264
00:16:53,979 --> 00:16:56,345
No, they just said I'm a superhero.

265
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:59,009
Right. You're Orgazmo.

266
00:16:59,084 --> 00:17:01,052
And you fight crime
with your Orgazmorator.

267
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,557
And I'm your sidekick, and I help you out
with my specially designed sex toys.

268
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:07,888
Oh.

269
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,793
I don't think I've seen you before.
Are you new in this business?

270
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:14,765
Oh, yeah. This is my first time.
I'm actually a normal person.

271
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,994
Hey, we're all normal people, man.

272
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:19,936
Hell, I got Ph. D.'s in physics
and engineering from M.I.T.

273
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:22,030
M.I.T.? In Boston?

274
00:17:22,107 --> 00:17:24,200
No, it's in Cambridge, actually.

275
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:27,734
But if you have two Ph.D.'s,
why do you do these kind of movies?

276
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:30,680
See you on set, Choda Boy.

277
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:34,011
That's why.

278
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:36,281
See, I have what's called
an overactive sex drive.

279
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:39,590
Hey, just between you and me,

280
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:42,320
I don't get a whole lot
of action from women.

281
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:46,728
- They don't seem to
take me very seriously.
- You don't say.

282
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:50,565
Yeah, but I get plenty of action here.
And I love every minute of it.

283
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:52,729
But if you're such a scientific genius,

284
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:54,739
don't you think
Heavenly Father has something...

285
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:58,538
more important planned for your life?
Who?

286
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:01,977
You.
What?

287
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:05,978
[Grunts]
Yeah.

288
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,578
Stand back, Jizzmaster Zero!

289
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,794
You look good, man.

290
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:19,763
Let's make some porno.

291
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:26,469
- Hey, man, you need to shave your balls?
- What? Why would I do that?

292
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:28,597
All male actors shave their balls, Joe.

293
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:31,541
Makes the old Johnson look bigger.

294
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,601
Give it a shot.

295
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,670
No, I'm not--
I'm using a stunt thing.

296
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:41,686
Oh, kid. You look fucking "fabeau"!
I see you met Choda Boy.

297
00:18:41,753 --> 00:18:43,983
Yes.
Hey, that's not the only thing
that changed.

298
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:45,990
I really beefed this script up.

299
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:48,390
Come on, people.
Let's get shooting!
Mr. Orbison.

300
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:51,452
Yeah?
You're not gonna put my name
anywhere on this movie are you?

301
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:53,464
Oh, no, kid.
You'll get a stage name.
Oh, good.

302
00:18:53,532 --> 00:18:55,693
Everybody does.
Now, let's see. Joe Young, right?
Right.

303
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:59,294
Young, Young,
tongue, bung, hung. Hung!

304
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:02,363
Tom Hung. It's perfect.
You like that?
No.

305
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:05,501
Okay, people. Let's go.
Come on. Set this up for me.

306
00:19:05,577 --> 00:19:07,568
Okay, this is what we're doing.

307
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:13,482
One: Uh, Candi, Saffi and Jizzmaster
Zero are getting busy on the bed.

308
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:16,646
- How busy?
- Both of you are doing oral on him.

309
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:21,557
And then two: Orgazmo
and Choda Boy break through the wall.

310
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:26,189
Three: They fight with
Jizzmaster Zero and his henchmen.

311
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:29,325
And four: You all fuck
like nasty pigs. Got it?

312
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:31,392
Nasty pigs. Got it.

313
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:34,462
Whoa, whoa. Mr. Orbison, you said
I wouldn't have to have sex, remember?

314
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:37,532
You said we'd use a stunt-- stunt--

315
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:39,543
Cock, a stunt cock.

316
00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:42,273
Yes, you get a stunt cock,
but only for penetration.

317
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:44,611
Penetration?
Who's gonna be penetrated?

318
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:48,175
Penetration is when the penis
enters an orifice, Joe.

319
00:19:48,253 --> 00:19:53,190
Penetration you don't do,
but you do have to get nasty
with the ladies. That's the deal.

320
00:19:53,258 --> 00:19:56,091
Okay, people. Let's go.

321
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:58,755
Lights on.
Lights are on and stable, Captain.

322
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,855
Whoo-hoo! Let's see some fuckin' action!

323
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:04,266
Dave, calm down.
Yeah? Right. Sorry.

324
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:06,463
All right. You give me
some nice close-ups.

325
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:09,769
Andyou give me a nice, slowzoom...

326
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:12,639
starting with a medium
close-up on the cock.

327
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:16,078
And then widening out
to an establishing shot.

328
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:18,082
Genius.

329
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:22,443
Roll cameras.

330
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:25,854
And we're sucking.

331
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:29,717
Good, we're sucking.

332

I can barely even lift it now.
What is it?

00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:39,786
It's the Orgazmorator.
I've made it work.

Golly, it's huge.
Yeah.

508
00:31:44,502 --> 00:31:47,665
I could probably make
a more compact version,
but then I'd have to use cold fusion...

509
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:50,674
instead of the fission device
that's inside of it now.

510
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:52,676

figure out cold fusion,

This guy looks really familiar.

989
01:04:25,361 --> 01:04:30,264
Of course he looks familiar.
He's Choda Boy in the film.

990
01:04:30,333 --> 01:04:34,360
Oh, yeah, that's right.
Choda Boy. Good stuff.

991
01:04:34,437 --> 01:04:37,497
- You work for Orbison?
- Is there a problem, Chapleski?

992
01:04:39,208 --> 01:04:44,874
No. No, there's no problem.
Excuse me.

993
01:04:46,349 --> 01:04:48,909
Hi, cupcake. I'm home.

994
01:04:48,985 --> 01:04:51,510
[Women]
Orgazmo!
And Choda Boy!

995
01:04:51,587 --> 01:04:55,614
[Joe] I'll use my Orgazmorator.
[Imitates Ray Gun]

996
01:04:55,691 --> 01:04:57,682
[Ben]
Nice shot!
[Sobs]

997
01:04:58,794 --> 01:05:01,194
Uh, how's it going?

998
01:05:01,264 --> 01:05:03,255
Joe, how could you?

999
01:05:05,301 --> 01:05:09,135
Lisa, listen to me.
You had your heart so set on
being married in the temple,

1000
01:05:09,205 --> 01:05:12,663
and-- and having a nice place to live,
and I wanted to have it all for you.

1001
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:15,176
But you had to know
that I didn't want this.

1002
01:05:18,281 --> 01:05:22,240
I-- It all happened so fast, Lis, but--

1003
01:05:22,318 --> 01:05:24,809
Fie on you, Satan!

1004
01:05:24,887 --> 01:05:26,878
[Sobs]

1005
01:05:28,024 --> 01:05:32,518
Lisa, I-- I thought nobody would never know.
I-I had no idea it would get this popular.

1006
01:05:32,595 --> 01:05:35,621
How could you have sex
with all of those women?

1007
01:05:35,698 --> 01:05:38,360
I didn't have sex with 'em.
It was a stunt cock.

1008
01:05:40,536 --> 01:05:43,004
A stunt... cock?

1009
01:05:43,072 --> 01:05:45,063
Yeah.

1010
01:05:45,141 --> 01:05:49,202
So-- So you aren't actually
touching those women's...

1011
01:05:49,278 --> 01:05:51,269
breasts?

1012
01:05:52,648 --> 01:05:55,879
Oh, no.
That's all just special effects.

1013
01:05:55,952 --> 01:05:59,388
Really?
No.

1014
01:06:01,457 --> 01:06:03,550
Lisa, I love you.

1015
01:06:03,626 --> 01:06:06,652
And-And I did this all for you
and for-for us.

1016
01:06:06,729 --> 01:06:10,256
Is this what you think
Heavenly Father has intended for you?

1017
01:06:11,701 --> 01:06:15,933
I don't know, Lisa.
All I know is that I'm
finally good at something.

1018
01:06:16,005 --> 01:06:18,098
You have to quit, Joe.

1019
01:06:18,174 --> 01:06:21,234
You have to quit right now
and get back to Utah.

1020
01:06:21,310 --> 01:06:23,676
I can't quit, Lisa.
We're still shooting.

1021
01:06:23,746 --> 01:06:27,011
But-- But what about me?

1022
01:06:27,083 --> 01:06:31,486
Lisa, It's two more days;
two more days of shooting
and then we'll have all the money we need.

1023
01:06:31,554 --> 01:06:34,853
I don't want the money
if this is how you have to earn it!

1024
01:06:34,924 --> 01:06:38,087
- Well, I don't know how else I can earn it!
-Joe, it is wrong!

1025
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:40,526
Would you just stop hollerin' at me?
Criminy!

1026
01:06:46,235 --> 01:06:48,499
I guess we don't have
anything else to say.

1027
01:06:59,715 --> 01:07:03,151
I don't know what's
happened to you, Joe.

1028
01:07:03,219 --> 01:07:07,713
But [Sniffles] I hope you're happy
in the life you've chosen.

1029
01:07:07,790 --> 01:07:09,883
Don't quote Dickens
in my apartment!

1030
01:07:11,894 --> 01:07:14,055
[Sobbing, Squeaking]

1031
01:07:16,699 --> 01:07:18,860
That's right. It's my house!

1032
01:07:18,934 --> 01:07:21,164
[T-Rex]
Ooh, come on now.

1033
01:07:21,237 --> 01:07:24,229
Come on baby. Ohh, ohh, yeah!

1034
01:07:24,306 --> 01:07:28,743
Shake that ass now! Come on.
Come on. Move that ass, baby.

1035
01:07:28,811 --> 01:07:31,075
Ooh, oh, yeah!

1036
01:07:31,147 --> 01:07:33,513
Oh, that's a baby now.
Lisa!

1037
01:07:33,582 --> 01:07:37,018
Ohh, you feel so good inside, baby.
Lisa!

1038
01:07:37,086 --> 01:07:39,554
Come on.
Who's your little flower now?
Li sa.

1039
01:07:39,622 --> 01:07:41,852
[Shouts]
Lisa!
Who's your little flower now?

1040
01:07:41,924 --> 01:07:45,917
That's right, baby. Come on.
Give it to Mama now!

1041
01:07:45,995 --> 01:07:48,190
Give it to Mama. Come on!
Aw, heck!

1042
01:07:48,264 --> 01:07:50,824
- What's your nam e again?
- I am Sancho.

1043
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:53,733
Look, I get a lot of people
auditioning all the time.

1044
01:07:53,803 --> 01:07:58,240
What makes you think
you'd be good at porno?
I am Sancho.

1045
01:07:58,307 --> 01:08:02,175
That's great,
but what do you do?

1046
01:08:02,244 --> 01:08:05,407
What do I do? I am Sancho.

1047
01:08:05,481 --> 01:08:10,043
- And?
- And there are many Jeffs in the world...

1048
01:08:10,119 --> 01:08:12,610
and many Toms as well.

1049
01:08:12,688 --> 01:08:16,124
But I... am Sancho.

1050
01:08:16,192 --> 01:08:19,593
- And?
- Are you Sancho?

1051
01:08:19,662 --> 01:08:21,892
No, you are not Sancho.

1052
01:08:21,964 --> 01:08:27,459
Neither is Scott Baio Sancho.
Frank Gifford, he's not Sancho.

1053
01:08:27,536 --> 01:08:31,404
- But I--
- You are Sancho!

1054
01:08:31,474 --> 01:08:35,069
- That's right.
- Okay, you're hired.

1055
01:08:35,144 --> 01:08:38,079
Of course.
You get a hundred bucks a scene.

1056
01:08:38,147 --> 01:08:44,052
We're shooting one tonight.
It's on the volcano set
with the Ass-Fuck Twins.

1057
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:46,213
[Intercom Beeps, Clicks]

1058
01:08:46,288 --> 01:08:49,815
Yeah?
[Man] Boss, Joe Young's here to see you.
He says it's very important.

1059
01:08:49,892 --> 01:08:53,828
Goddamn it. Send him in.
[Beeps, Clicks]

1060
01:08:58,234 --> 01:09:00,566
What do you want, Hung?
I'm very, very busy.

1061
01:09:00,636 --> 01:09:03,537
Well, Mr. Orbison,
I just came by to tell you that...

1062
01:09:03,606 --> 01:09:06,973
I have to quit.
Oh, my God, it's Orgazmo!

1063
01:09:07,042 --> 01:09:09,033
I'm not Orgazmo!
I am Sancho.

1064
01:09:09,111 --> 01:09:13,775
You see, Mr. Orbison, my-my fiancée
came in from out of town,
and everything just--

1065
01:09:13,849 --> 01:09:17,615
Well, dang it, I just have to
get back to Utah and marry her!

1066
01:09:17,686 --> 01:09:20,450
Get outta here.
I'll see you on set tomorrow.

1067
01:09:20,523 --> 01:09:22,923
No, I'm serious. I--

1068
01:09:22,992 --> 01:09:26,655
I appreciate everything you've done for me,
but I have to say no.

1069
01:09:26,729 --> 01:09:29,527
My contract does state
that I can leave whenever I want.

1070
01:09:29,598 --> 01:09:32,328
Wait a minute, kid.
You're forgetting something.

1071
01:09:32,401 --> 01:09:36,531
- What?
- That contracts don't mean shit to me!

1072
01:09:36,605 --> 01:09:40,439
Now, you're gonna finish this film,
and then do you know
what you're gonna do?

1073
01:09:40,509 --> 01:09:43,103
- No.
- You're gonna do Orgazmo 3,

1074
01:09:43,179 --> 01:09:48,242
Orgazmo 4, Orgazmo 5,
Orgazmo Twenty-fucking-seven
if I want you to!

1075
01:09:48,317 --> 01:09:51,343
- And do you know why?
- No.

1076
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:56,517
Because I'm Maxxx Orbison,
and I get what I want!

1077
01:09:56,592 --> 01:10:00,119
Now-- Now, hold on a minute, Mr. Orbison.
I said I don't wanna do it.

1078
01:10:00,196 --> 01:10:04,064
- And you don't-- you don't own me.
- You wanna bet I don't, punk?

1079
01:10:04,133 --> 01:10:10,072
Now, I'm warning you, kid:
Don't fuck with me!

1080
01:10:10,139 --> 01:10:13,233
Now, you go home
and you tell your little fiancée
that the wedding is off,

1081
01:10:13,309 --> 01:10:18,770
and you have your ass back here
tomorrow a.m.!

1082
01:10:18,847 --> 01:10:24,808
Or else you'll be sleeping
with the fishes. See?

1083
01:10:27,056 --> 01:10:30,321
[Clicks, Beeps]
Send in the next audition.

1084
01:10:31,460 --> 01:10:36,193
You know, I have had enough
of your poop, Mr. Orbison.

1085
01:10:36,265 --> 01:10:38,426
Find yourself another Orgazmo!

1086
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:40,832
I'm warnin' you, Hung!

1087
01:10:40,903 --> 01:10:42,894
Good-bye!

1088
01:10:44,273 --> 01:10:47,003
Not so fast, happy pants.

1089
01:10:47,076 --> 01:10:49,909
Fss-sss-aaa-aah!
[Orbison]
No. No.

1090
01:10:49,979 --> 01:10:53,676
It's his decision. Let him go.

1091
01:10:58,187 --> 01:11:00,519
Hm!

1092
01:11:00,589 --> 01:11:03,183
You should've let me whup his ass,
Uncle Orbison!

1093
01:11:03,259 --> 01:11:06,387
No, we don't need him all messed up
for the shoot tomorrow.

1094
01:11:08,264 --> 01:11:10,255
There's another way.

1095
01:11:12,001 --> 01:11:13,992
[Sniffling]

1096
01:11:15,404 --> 01:11:17,998
[Bags Hit Ground]

1097
01:11:18,073 --> 01:11:20,337
Joe?

1098
01:11:20,409 --> 01:11:23,071
Joe, it's me.

1099
01:11:23,145 --> 01:11:26,114
Joe, come on. Can we please
just talk about this some more?

1100
01:11:28,984 --> 01:11:31,384
Joe.
Hi, Ben.

1101
01:11:31,453 --> 01:11:35,480
Man, I just tried callin' you.
I've got some big news.
No, no, no. I've got big news too.

1102
01:11:35,557 --> 01:11:37,650
I just quit.
What?

1103
01:11:37,726 --> 01:11:42,060
I'm goin' back to Utah
to be a normal Mormon again.
I just came to say good-bye.

1104
01:11:42,131 --> 01:11:45,999
I found out who's been
beating up G-Fresh.
It's Orbison.

1105
01:11:46,068 --> 01:11:48,832
Those thugs work for him,
Joe.

1106
01:11:49,838 --> 01:11:53,899
Orbison. Wow.
Boy, that guy just thinks
he owns the world, doesn't he?

1107
01:11:53,976 --> 01:11:57,776
Yeah, he does.
And that's why you and I need to do somethin'.

1108
01:11:57,846 --> 01:12:01,942
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Look, I might have lost the only thing
that really matters to me.

1109
01:12:02,017 --> 01:12:04,349
I'm not staying in this town
another hour!

1110
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:08,880
Hey, you're gonna let
Orbison extort money
from somebody like G-Fresh?

1111
01:12:08,957 --> 01:12:12,324
Listen to me, Joe! You need to--
No, no.
You-- You listen to me, Ben.

1112
01:12:12,394 --> 01:12:16,023
I don't know exactly when I lost
control of my life, but I want it back!

1113
01:12:16,098 --> 01:12:18,430
No, wait a minute.
See, now you're doin' what they told ya!

1114
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:24,461
Doggone it, Ben! I'm not a superhero.
I'm a Latter-day Saint.

1115
01:12:35,150 --> 01:12:37,141
Lisa?
[Ringing]

1116
01:12:45,361 --> 01:12:47,693
- Hello?
-Joe! Joe, help me!

1117
01:12:47,763 --> 01:12:50,994
- Lisa, what--
-Joe!

1118
01:12:51,066 --> 01:12:54,866
- I told you not to fuck with me, Hung!
- What have you done with her?

1119
01:12:54,937 --> 01:12:58,566
I'm gonna send her away
so you don't have to worry
about her for a while.

1120
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:01,200
Now, you be on set tomorrow a.m.,

1121
01:13:01,276 --> 01:13:03,642
or else I'm not gonna send her away.

1122
01:13:03,712 --> 01:13:05,839
I'm gonna blow her away.

1123
01:13:05,914 --> 01:13:08,474
Do you understand what I mean?

1124
01:13:08,550 --> 01:13:12,179
You mean, she'll be sleeping
with the fishes, see?

1125
01:13:12,254 --> 01:13:18,159
That's right. Now, you just finish this film,
and we'll see about getting
you two lovebirds back together.

1126
01:13:18,227 --> 01:13:20,787
Don't hurt her-- her.

Oh.

- [Fist Thumps]
- What should we do with her, boss, huh?

1129
01:13:35,978 --> 01:13:39,277
We need some collateral.

1130
01:13:39,348 --> 01:13:41,839
Twins! Take a break.

1131
01:13:41,917 --> 01:13:44,784
Put her on the set.

1132
01:13:46,755 --> 01:13:51,624
Joe, what the hell you doin'?
He took her, Ben.
Orbison took my cupcake!

1133
01:13:51,693 --> 01:13:54,753
Oh, shit!
I knew it would come to this.

1134
01:13:54,830 --> 01:13:58,129
Where's the Orgazmorator?
I have to get her back.
Hold on. Listen.

1135
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:02,603
Orbison's mansion is like a fortress, Joe.
There's no way you can do this by yourself.
I know.

1136
01:14:02,671 --> 01:14:07,074
That's why I need you.
Damn, Joe.
I've never seen you like this.

1137
01:14:07,142 --> 01:14:09,372
I'm pissed off.

1138
01:14:09,445 --> 01:14:12,881
- Help me! Help!
- Will you shut up?

1139
01:14:12,948 --> 01:14:17,317
You pig! You're the one responsible
for degrading all of those women!

1140
01:14:17,386 --> 01:14:20,787
Hey, hey, what about men, huh?
He degrades them too.

1141
01:14:20,856 --> 01:14:23,723
Yeah, men are equally degraded
in pornographic films.

01:27:48,863 --> 01:27:52,526
This is the last of
the bedroom stuff.
Oh, great.

1306
01:27:56,104 --> 01:27:57,969
[Horn Honking]

1307
01:28:04,245 --> 01:28:06,907
- Hey, kids.
- Hi, Choda Boy.

1308
01:28:06,981 --> 01:28:09,415
All ready to leave, huh?

1309
01:28:09,484 --> 01:28:11,475
Yeah, I, uh--

1310
01:28:11,552 --> 01:28:14,487
I guess so.
[Sighs]
So, I...

1311
01:28:14,555 --> 01:28:17,718
guess there's no more...

1312
01:28:17,792 --> 01:28:20,056
Orgazmo and Choda Boy.

1313
01:28:20,128 --> 01:28:22,926
No, I-- I don't think so.

1314
01:28:22,997 --> 01:28:26,592
So, maybe someday
I could come to Utah.

1315
01:28:28,403 --> 01:28:31,304
It was-- It was really good
meeting you, really good.

1316
01:28:31,372 --> 01:28:35,308
Yeah. There was a lot
of good stuff goin' on.

1317
01:28:35,376 --> 01:28:37,708
Whole lot of good stuff.
Good stuff.

1318
01:28:37,779 --> 01:28:39,713
Good, good stuff.
Yeah.

1319
01:28:39,781 --> 01:28:43,080
Kind of stuff that...
makes you feel good.
It's good.

1320
01:28:44,319 --> 01:28:48,016
- Yeah, Joe.
- [Sobs] Oh, Joe!

1321
01:28:48,089 --> 01:28:51,650
[Lisa]
I can't let you do this.
Oh, God!

1322
01:28:51,726 --> 01:28:56,823
Joe, this really is crazy, but I think
you might have been right.

1323
01:28:56,898 --> 01:28:59,799
What?
Oh, Joe, it is so hard to know...

1324
01:28:59,867 --> 01:29:03,200
what Heavenly Father wants from us
or what he has in mind.

1325
01:29:03,271 --> 01:29:07,970
This whole thing is just too
gosh-darn wacky to be coinky-dink!

1326
01:29:08,042 --> 01:29:11,773
Maybe this is what Heavenly Father
has intended for you.

1327
01:29:11,846 --> 01:29:14,838
[Laughs]
Oh, Lisa.

1328
01:29:14,916 --> 01:29:16,907
Oh, Joe!
[Laughing]

1329
01:29:21,889 --> 01:29:24,323
Whoa! They're goin'crazy!

1330
01:29:27,095 --> 01:29:29,529
Ohh, ho-ho-ho!

1331
01:29:29,597 --> 01:29:31,997
Ben, L.A. needs us.

1332
01:29:32,066 --> 01:29:34,864
The world needs us. Heck, I think
the whole universe needs us!

1333
01:29:34,936 --> 01:29:39,964
You mean, you're gonna stay?
I think you guys need
to clean up Los Angeles.

1334
01:29:40,041 --> 01:29:44,137
Well, there's nothin' that can stop us!
Well, crime fighting will have
a new name!

1335
01:29:44,212 --> 01:29:48,581
From now on, if someone
wants to turn to a life of crime,
they'll have to answer to Orgazmo.

1336
01:29:48,649 --> 01:29:52,710
- And Choda Boy!
- Oh! This is so wonderful! Let's pray.

1337
01:29:52,787 --> 01:29:55,551
Oh, boy, look at the time.
Now, Choda Boy,

1338
01:29:55,623 --> 01:29:58,490
superheroes that pray together
stay together.

1339
01:29:58,559 --> 01:30:00,550
Ah, what the fuck.

1340
01:30:01,729 --> 01:30:05,358
Heavenly Father, may we serve you
in the best way we know how.

1341
01:30:05,433 --> 01:30:10,427
May our decisions be rash,
may we do what's right,
and God bless us.

1342
01:30:10,505 --> 01:30:15,670
God bless us, every one!

1343
01:30:15,743 --> 01:30:18,610
Oh!
Oh!

1344
01:30:18,679 --> 01:30:20,909
Ah!
Hey, hey, hey!

1345
01:30:29,991 --> 01:30:31,959
Ahh!

1346
01:30:32,026 --> 01:30:34,517
Choda Boy!

1347
01:30:42,904 --> 01:30:46,897
Oh, well, Doc, how bad is it?

1348
01:30:46,974 --> 01:30:51,411
Isn't good, Mr. Orbison.
There's a problem...
with your little guy.

1349
01:30:51,479 --> 01:30:54,607
What's wrong with my little guy?

1350
01:30:54,682 --> 01:30:58,482
Well, I'm afraid your testicles
have swollen to the size
of Florida oranges.

1351
01:30:58,553 --> 01:31:01,647
Don't you think I noticed that!
[Groans]

1352
01:31:01,722 --> 01:31:04,987
Tell me somethin' I don't know,
you cocky prick!

1353
01:31:06,227 --> 01:31:09,196
We're gonna have to
amputate your pee-pee.

1354
01:31:15,369 --> 01:31:17,360
[Laughing]

1355
01:31:21,042 --> 01:31:23,840
I've got you now, Joe Young!

1356
01:31:24,979 --> 01:31:28,312
Soon you'll be meeting up with...

1357
01:31:28,382 --> 01:31:31,647
Neutered Man!
