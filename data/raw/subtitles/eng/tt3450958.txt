1
00:01:05,094 --> 00:01:08,327
Fifteen years ago, a
scientific experiment gone wrong

2
00:01:08,328 --> 00:01:11,158
gave RISE to a species
of intelligent apes

3
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:14,926
and destroyed most of humanity with a
virus that became known as Simian Flu.

4
00:01:14,927 --> 00:01:19,630
RISE

5
00:01:19,781 --> 00:01:23,531
With the DAWN of a new ape
civilization led by Caesar,

6
00:01:23,532 --> 00:01:25,953
the surviving humans
struggled to coexist.

7
00:01:25,954 --> 00:01:29,027
But fighting finally broke
out when a rebel ape, Koba,

8
00:01:29,028 --> 00:01:31,455
led a vengeful attack against humans.

9
00:01:31,456 --> 00:01:35,700
DAWN

10
00:01:36,636 --> 00:01:39,755
The humans sent a distress call
to a military base in the North,

11
00:01:39,756 --> 00:01:41,889
where all that remained of
the U.S. Army was gathered.

12
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:45,884
A ruthless Special Forces
Colonel and his hardened battalion

13
00:01:45,885 --> 00:01:47,711
were dispatched to
exterminate the apes.

14
00:01:47,712 --> 00:01:51,457
Evading capture for the last two years, Caesar
is now rumoured to be marshalling the fight

15
00:01:51,458 --> 00:01:56,745
from a hidden command base in
the wood, as the WAR rages on.

16
00:01:56,746 --> 00:01:58,608
WAR

17
00:01:58,609 --> 00:02:05,609
WAR FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES

18
00:02:05,913 --> 00:02:11,073
MONKEY KILLER

19
00:02:12,655 --> 00:02:16,895
BEDTIME FOR BONZO

20
00:02:21,468 --> 00:02:24,929
ENDANGERED SPECIES

21
00:02:54,409 --> 00:02:57,119
Cap.

22
00:03:36,677 --> 00:03:39,387
Is that a trench?

23
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,763
It looks like there's more of them inside.

24
00:03:46,923 --> 00:03:49,618
Echo 2-6 to command.

25
00:03:49,619 --> 00:03:53,074
Colonel, we've got eyes on 3 kongs in
the north woods. One of them is armed.

26
00:03:53,075 --> 00:03:57,418
Our donkey just spotted another
trench. Maybe the base is near.

27
00:03:57,609 --> 00:04:00,569
Yes, sir.

28
00:04:01,335 --> 00:04:04,045
Yes, sir. Copy.
Over.

29
00:04:09,171 --> 00:04:11,881
Donkey.

30
00:04:16,308 --> 00:04:19,018
Preacher.

31
00:04:22,394 --> 00:04:24,338
The one with the gun.

32
00:04:24,339 --> 00:04:28,754
As soon he guns him down, you guys
take out the trench. -Yes, sir. -Yes, sir.

33
00:04:48,144 --> 00:04:50,854
Fire!

34
00:04:56,659 --> 00:04:59,369
Come on!

35
00:06:18,886 --> 00:06:21,596
Reload.

36
00:07:16,306 --> 00:07:19,016
Fall back!

37
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:43,710
Colonel, do you copy?
Colonel?

38
00:07:43,711 --> 00:07:46,794
Who is this? -Preacher, sir.
Preacher. -Where are you, soldier?

39
00:07:46,795 --> 00:07:50,662
I need your position. -I don't know.
-What do you see?

40
00:07:50,857 --> 00:07:54,360
I can't see anything, sir. We lost
a lot of men and captain is dead, sir.

41
00:07:54,361 --> 00:07:58,456
Calm down. You're in command now.
-Command, sir?

42
00:07:58,457 --> 00:08:01,829
I think it’s just me by myself now.

43
00:08:04,907 --> 00:08:07,463
Colonel, I don’t think
I’m gonna make it, sir.

44
00:08:07,464 --> 00:08:09,950
I am sorry. I am so sorry, sir.

45
00:08:09,951 --> 00:08:13,352
Listen to me.
Kill as many as you can.

46
00:08:17,342 --> 00:08:20,052
No. No, no!

47
00:09:35,069 --> 00:09:38,000
63 dead.

48
00:09:42,794 --> 00:09:46,253
You are him. You're Caesar.

49
00:09:47,543 --> 00:09:50,175
We've been searching
for you for so long.

50
00:09:50,176 --> 00:09:53,718
We heard you had a hidden command
base, but we could never find it.

51
00:09:53,719 --> 00:09:56,192
Some of us were starting to
think that you might be dead,

52
00:09:56,193 --> 00:10:00,687
but the Colonel McCullough said you were out
here somewhere. -Kill us already. -Shut up, man!

53
00:10:00,688 --> 00:10:04,702
What? They're animals.
He's gonna slaughter us.

54
00:10:11,371 --> 00:10:16,974
I did not start this war.

55
00:10:17,107 --> 00:10:20,811
The ape who did is dead.

56
00:10:21,703 --> 00:10:24,045
His name was Koba.

57
00:10:24,046 --> 00:10:26,756
I killed him.

58
00:10:28,304 --> 00:10:35,200
Now I fight only to protect apes.
-Yeah?

59
00:10:36,763 --> 00:10:41,398
What about him?
We got ten more just like him.

60
00:10:41,889 --> 00:10:47,241
I know these apes. They followed Koba.

61
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:50,520
They tried to kill me.

62
00:10:50,521 --> 00:10:54,012
They fear what I will do to them.

63
00:10:54,013 --> 00:10:56,112
So now

64
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:58,692
they serve you…

65
00:10:58,693 --> 00:11:01,403
just to survive.

66
00:11:02,314 --> 00:11:06,160
I no fear you!

67
00:11:09,272 --> 00:11:13,035
You must fear!

68
00:11:13,036 --> 00:11:17,402
How long you think
woods can protect you?

69
00:11:17,403 --> 00:11:21,004
Humans destroy you.

70
00:11:21,482 --> 00:11:25,942
Their Colonel has all power.

71
00:11:26,091 --> 00:11:31,066
For them, he more than just human.

72
00:11:32,784 --> 00:11:34,948
He everything.

73
00:11:34,949 --> 00:11:39,013
He say: "First Caesar die…

74
00:11:39,917 --> 00:11:43,835
then all of you die."

75
00:11:50,064 --> 00:11:53,930
Winter! Take this traitor outside!

76
00:11:59,811 --> 00:12:03,677
What should we do with the humans?

77
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,857
You are letting us go?

78
00:12:18,858 --> 00:12:22,733
Tell your Colonel…
you have seen me now.

79
00:12:22,978 --> 00:12:27,064
And I have a message for him.
Leave us the woods…

80
00:12:27,065 --> 00:12:29,775
and the killing can stop.

81
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:43,393
Do you think they will
give him the message?

82
00:12:43,394 --> 00:12:46,576
They are the message, Maurice.

83
00:12:46,614 --> 00:12:49,690
He will see we are not savages.

84
00:12:56,669 --> 00:13:01,230
The traitor attacked me! He got away!

85
00:13:27,731 --> 00:13:31,799
Koba still haunts us.

86
00:13:33,693 --> 00:13:41,598
What I didn't see that he could
not forgive what humans did to him.

87
00:13:42,167 --> 00:13:45,658
No one could have known
how much darkness...

88
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:49,691
was living inside him.

89
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:26,265
Father!

90
00:14:40,763 --> 00:14:43,078
Welcome home, Rocket.

91
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:45,721
You look tired.

92
00:14:45,722 --> 00:14:50,485
It was a long journey.
-Father, we found something!

93
00:14:50,486 --> 00:14:53,196
Come.

94
00:15:18,158 --> 00:15:20,986
Mother!

95
00:15:27,947 --> 00:15:32,722
Cornelius...
Say hi to your brother!

96
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:43,753
Look who's here, son...

97
00:15:53,594 --> 00:15:57,060
Lake...

98
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:30,718
This is it, Father.
We can start over. A new home.

99
00:16:31,013 --> 00:16:36,774
What is beyond those mountains, son?
-Show them, Rocket.

100
00:16:48,566 --> 00:16:52,883
A desert! The journey is long...

101
00:16:52,884 --> 00:16:55,756
But that is why humans
will not find us.

102
00:16:55,757 --> 00:16:58,769
We must leave tonight!

103
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:01,006
Tonight? That's impossible.

104
00:17:01,007 --> 00:17:06,668
How long can we wait, Lake?
Soldiers getting closer! -Winter...

105
00:17:14,644 --> 00:17:18,035
Your son's been gone, Caesar...

106
00:17:18,036 --> 00:17:22,843
He doesn't know how hard it's been.

107
00:17:24,714 --> 00:17:28,114
I know you are scared...

108
00:17:28,115 --> 00:17:30,756
We all are...

109
00:17:30,757 --> 00:17:34,599
But we are still planning...

110
00:17:36,227 --> 00:17:42,566
Yes. We must find
a safe way out of woods.

111
00:17:42,567 --> 00:17:44,993
There were only two of you.

112
00:17:44,994 --> 00:17:49,006
But we are many.

113
00:17:59,003 --> 00:18:03,117
We will find a way out of here.

114
00:18:05,193 --> 00:18:11,252
Apes together strong.

115
00:19:19,878 --> 00:19:24,410
Stay here, son.
Protect your mother and brother!

116
00:20:07,967 --> 00:20:09,962
Caesar! What's wrong?

117
00:20:09,963 --> 00:20:11,806
How many on patrol?

118
00:20:11,807 --> 00:20:14,624
Five? Six?
-Get them!

119
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:17,872
Luca, get Rocket too.

120
00:21:09,929 --> 00:21:12,864
Unit calling command.
Colonel...

121
00:21:22,203 --> 00:21:28,212
Rocket? What happened?
-I heard him talking! Colonel is here!

122
00:21:29,081 --> 00:21:32,116
Ninety-nine, target acquired.

123
00:21:32,117 --> 00:21:37,325
Ninety-nine, target acquired.
Repeat, King Kong is dead.

124
00:21:37,326 --> 00:21:40,986
Let's go.
I get up from here.

125
00:23:46,112 --> 00:23:50,622
Caesar...
We can't find Winter!

126
00:23:52,676 --> 00:23:57,308
He was scared! I think he betrayed us!

127
00:24:00,748 --> 00:24:05,033
Have you found Cornelius yet?

128
00:24:05,034 --> 00:24:08,125
We're still searching.

129
00:24:11,781 --> 00:24:16,142
Let's go look for Caesar’s little son.

130
00:24:48,731 --> 00:24:51,735
Come, Cornelius.

131
00:24:59,233 --> 00:25:02,384
You're safe now.

132
00:25:19,124 --> 00:25:21,374
Lake.

133
00:25:21,375 --> 00:25:23,723
You loved my son.

134
00:25:23,724 --> 00:25:27,864
Look after his brother,
until I return.

135
00:25:32,346 --> 00:25:36,487
You're not coming with
us to our new home?

136
00:25:36,488 --> 00:25:39,198
No.

137
00:25:42,134 --> 00:25:44,844
Go with Lake.

138
00:25:59,587 --> 00:26:04,183
Caesar! You're not going after them?!

139
00:26:05,496 --> 00:26:07,218
Not them, him.

140
00:26:07,219 --> 00:26:11,386
Caesar, you are our leader!

141
00:26:11,387 --> 00:26:15,129
We can't leave without you!

142
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:17,820
You must.

143
00:26:17,821 --> 00:26:19,967
The soldiers will be back soon.

144
00:26:19,968 --> 00:26:22,914
Father!

145
00:26:23,521 --> 00:26:27,972
When I find him,
the soldiers will all come after me.

146
00:26:28,635 --> 00:26:32,628
That makes you the best chance
to get out of woods.

147
00:26:35,012 --> 00:26:38,169
Where is he going?!

148
00:26:40,876 --> 00:26:45,396
Caesar! Caesar!

149
00:27:33,397 --> 00:27:38,578
The soldiers' camp is always moving.
My guards think they know where it is.

150
00:27:38,579 --> 00:27:43,634
Let me take you.
-You need me to back you up!

151
00:27:43,784 --> 00:27:46,318
No!

152
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:53,862
Please...
I know what it's like to lose a son.

153
00:27:54,283 --> 00:27:58,698
I may not make it back.

154
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:03,301
That's why I'm coming.

155
00:28:03,927 --> 00:28:07,771
To make sure you do.

156
00:28:43,353 --> 00:28:49,363
Guards think soldiers here...
Always fires burning.

157
00:29:01,681 --> 00:29:04,127
No one here.

158
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:07,325
Search the area.

159
00:29:29,384 --> 00:29:32,283
Just gonna put this down.

160
00:30:05,629 --> 00:30:08,279
What's he doing out here alone?

161
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:11,481
Maybe he's a deserter?

162
00:31:22,918 --> 00:31:25,628
Look around.

163
00:31:27,804 --> 00:31:30,514
Take what you can.

164
00:33:23,343 --> 00:33:28,356
Something wrong with her.
I don't think she can speak.

165
00:33:29,328 --> 00:33:32,038
Come.

166
00:33:48,989 --> 00:33:53,789
She'll die out here alone.

167
00:33:54,352 --> 00:33:57,577
We cannot take her, Maurice.

168
00:34:00,722 --> 00:34:07,100
I understand...
But I cannot leave her.

169
00:35:14,876 --> 00:35:19,084
Did you find the Colonel?

170
00:35:19,085 --> 00:35:21,844
No.

171
00:35:21,959 --> 00:35:24,669
Winter.

172
00:35:37,305 --> 00:35:40,015
Where is the Colonel?

173
00:35:48,515 --> 00:35:51,599
He's gone.
-Gone?

174
00:35:52,664 --> 00:35:58,152
He left this morning,
took many men with him.

175
00:35:58,153 --> 00:36:01,721
More soldiers are coming
down from the North.

176
00:36:01,722 --> 00:36:06,922
The Colonel is going to
meet them at the border.

177
00:36:07,095 --> 00:36:10,409
What border?
Why?

178
00:36:13,937 --> 00:36:16,293
I don't know.

179
00:36:16,294 --> 00:36:19,963
But the rest of us are going tomorrow.

180
00:36:20,945 --> 00:36:24,979
Donkeys think the
soldiers from the North

181
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:29,197
are coming to help finish
off the apes for good.

182
00:36:29,198 --> 00:36:32,193
That day, after the
battle on the hill,

183
00:36:32,194 --> 00:36:36,753
the donkey we caught promised me
the Colonel would spare my life

184
00:36:36,754 --> 00:36:41,347
if I told them where you were hiding.

185
00:36:41,746 --> 00:36:45,435
Forgive me!

186
00:36:48,694 --> 00:36:52,000
My son...

187
00:36:53,056 --> 00:36:57,400
My wife...

188
00:36:58,339 --> 00:37:01,049
are dead.

189
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:14,506
Now what do we do?

190
00:38:14,507 --> 00:38:17,020
Wait till the soldiers go...

191
00:38:17,021 --> 00:38:21,330
Follow them to the Colonel.

192
00:38:53,966 --> 00:38:56,130
Koba?

193
00:38:56,131 --> 00:39:03,261
Ape not kill ape.

194
00:39:11,455 --> 00:39:15,528
The soldiers are leaving!

195
00:39:52,459 --> 00:39:55,169
They stopped.

196
00:40:07,714 --> 00:40:10,973
What are they shooting at?

197
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:15,309
I don't know.

198
00:41:36,952 --> 00:41:39,662
Why did they shoot you?

199
00:41:58,757 --> 00:42:01,567
Like her!

200
00:42:01,843 --> 00:42:04,647
He cannot speak!

201
00:42:07,278 --> 00:42:11,664
He will die of those wounds.

202
00:42:20,888 --> 00:42:23,598
Luca.

203
00:42:43,104 --> 00:42:45,371
Where did the soldiers go?!

204
00:42:45,372 --> 00:42:49,044
Winter said they
were going to a border.

205
00:42:49,045 --> 00:42:52,388
Yes but which way is that?!

206
00:46:39,799 --> 00:46:44,031
Bad... ape.

207
00:46:48,391 --> 00:46:52,253
Bad ape.

208
00:46:53,813 --> 00:46:55,712
Who are you?

209
00:46:55,713 --> 00:46:59,200
What are you doing here?

210
00:47:00,733 --> 00:47:03,970
I don't think he understands.

211
00:47:05,497 --> 00:47:10,270
I don't recognize him.
He's not one of us.

212
00:47:11,426 --> 00:47:14,279
Are you alone here?

213
00:47:33,171 --> 00:47:35,881
Cold?

214
00:47:51,050 --> 00:47:53,765
Cold.

215
00:47:57,208 --> 00:48:00,633
I see girl.
I think you human.

216
00:48:00,634 --> 00:48:05,039
But you ape. Like me!

217
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:08,023
No, no. Put down.

218
00:48:08,695 --> 00:48:14,517
How long have you been here?
-Long time. Long... long time.

219
00:48:24,756 --> 00:48:27,414
Home.

220
00:48:27,415 --> 00:48:30,125
Old home.

221
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:33,034
SIERRA
ZOO

222
00:48:34,232 --> 00:48:36,545
Are there more like you?

223
00:48:36,546 --> 00:48:42,045
More apes… from zoo?
-Dead. All dead.

224
00:48:42,143 --> 00:48:46,699
Long time.
Human get sick.

225
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:50,214
Ape get smart.

226
00:48:50,264 --> 00:48:53,930
Then human kill ape. But not me.

227
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:56,165
I run.

228
00:48:56,166 --> 00:49:01,874
You learned to speak?
-Listened human.

229
00:49:04,528 --> 00:49:07,238
Bad ape!

230
00:49:08,183 --> 00:49:10,736
Bad ape.

231
00:49:10,737 --> 00:49:12,501
No.

232
00:49:12,502 --> 00:49:15,359
No touch.

233
00:49:15,555 --> 00:49:18,265
That's mine.

234
00:49:23,776 --> 00:49:26,486
I am okay.

235
00:49:34,633 --> 00:49:36,444
Amazing...

236
00:49:36,445 --> 00:49:39,123
Always thought we were the only ones.

237
00:49:39,124 --> 00:49:42,177
Wonder if there are more in the world?

238
00:49:42,178 --> 00:49:46,212
More apes like us.

239
00:49:46,853 --> 00:49:51,279
Here. Eat. Eat.

240
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:55,579
New friends.

241
00:49:55,580 --> 00:49:57,734
Special day.

242
00:49:57,735 --> 00:50:01,193
CALIFORNIA BORDER
QUARANTINE FACILITY

243
00:50:01,194 --> 00:50:04,151
Where did you get this?

244
00:50:05,795 --> 00:50:08,060
Bad place.

245
00:50:08,061 --> 00:50:12,353
I find long time ago.
After zoo I look for food.

246
00:50:12,354 --> 00:50:15,623
I find human zoo.

247
00:50:15,624 --> 00:50:18,293
Zoo for sick.

248
00:50:18,294 --> 00:50:23,712
Big walls. Sick human climb.

249
00:50:23,884 --> 00:50:26,921
Bad human kill.

250
00:50:26,922 --> 00:50:34,426
And then all get sick. All
dead now. Long time. Long time.

251
00:50:34,427 --> 00:50:37,432
Bad humans?

252
00:50:37,433 --> 00:50:40,143
Soldiers?

253
00:50:41,908 --> 00:50:45,131
Soldiers.
-A deserted military camp!

254
00:50:45,132 --> 00:50:48,437
On the border!

255
00:50:48,438 --> 00:50:53,564
Maybe the Colonel and the
troops are going there?

256
00:50:53,668 --> 00:50:58,015
Is it far? Can you take us?
-Human zoo?

257
00:50:58,016 --> 00:51:01,495
No! No go back there.
I...

258
00:51:01,496 --> 00:51:04,052
Everyone dead. I come
here. Very safe here.

259
00:51:04,053 --> 00:51:08,252
Never go back! No!
-Please. You must take us. -No!

260
00:51:08,366 --> 00:51:12,775
No! Cannot take! Cannot take!
No, no!

261
00:51:12,776 --> 00:51:15,457
No! Look! Look! Look!

262
00:51:15,458 --> 00:51:18,209
More snow. Cannot go. Must stay.

263
00:51:18,210 --> 00:51:23,250
You eat, you rest, stay here.
With me.

264
00:51:24,656 --> 00:51:28,006
Here. You keep.

265
00:51:29,908 --> 00:51:32,618
She keep.

266
00:51:59,002 --> 00:52:02,291
Who is...

267
00:52:06,296 --> 00:52:08,883
child?

268
00:52:08,884 --> 00:52:11,594
I don't know.

269
00:52:11,785 --> 00:52:16,149
But she with you?

270
00:52:17,713 --> 00:52:20,711
She has no one else.

271
00:52:26,199 --> 00:52:31,161
I see you look at her just now.

272
00:52:32,822 --> 00:52:36,368
Look sad.

273
00:52:40,006 --> 00:52:43,606
You have child?

274
00:52:45,350 --> 00:52:48,060
One.

275
00:52:49,144 --> 00:52:52,266
The other was killed by human.

276
00:52:54,322 --> 00:52:57,032
Soldier?

277
00:53:07,714 --> 00:53:10,424
I...

278
00:53:12,518 --> 00:53:16,523
Had child.

279
00:53:21,805 --> 00:53:26,370
You think you will find him…

280
00:53:27,810 --> 00:53:30,520
at human zoo?

281
00:53:34,797 --> 00:53:37,754
Soldier?

282
00:53:39,777 --> 00:53:42,487
I don't know.

283
00:53:43,793 --> 00:53:46,503
Maybe.

284
00:53:47,726 --> 00:53:50,436
Then...

285
00:53:54,073 --> 00:53:58,686
Maybe I take you.

286
00:55:40,332 --> 00:55:43,042
Thirsty.

287
00:55:43,253 --> 00:55:45,968
Thirsty.

288
00:55:47,891 --> 00:55:50,601
Thirsty.

289
00:56:04,814 --> 00:56:07,664
Luca, come.
Let's go closer.

290
00:56:07,665 --> 00:56:10,375
Keep them safe.

291
00:56:15,433 --> 00:56:17,457
What are they doing?

292
00:56:17,458 --> 00:56:20,368
I don't know.

293
00:56:22,705 --> 00:56:27,165
What's that? A patrol?

294
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:30,101
I don't see riders.

295
00:56:34,299 --> 00:56:37,009
Hold it!

296
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:40,790
I saw them coming.

297
00:57:10,996 --> 00:57:14,113
At least this time...

298
00:57:14,114 --> 00:57:17,983
I was able to protect you...

299
00:58:27,925 --> 00:58:31,080
Caesar...

300
00:58:32,030 --> 00:58:37,372
This must stop. It's not too
late to join the other apes.

301
00:58:37,373 --> 00:58:40,492
We cannot turn back!

302
00:58:40,868 --> 00:58:42,721
Luca gave his life.

303
00:58:42,722 --> 00:58:45,500
Please!

304
00:58:49,946 --> 00:58:52,656
They must pay.

305
00:58:58,333 --> 00:59:00,444
Now...

306
00:59:00,445 --> 00:59:04,152
you sound like Koba.

307
00:59:09,987 --> 00:59:12,527
It was a mistake bringing you all.

308
00:59:12,528 --> 00:59:14,950
This is my fight.

309
00:59:14,951 --> 00:59:17,661
I will finish this alone.

310
00:59:18,493 --> 00:59:21,424
Go. Now.

311
00:59:21,425 --> 00:59:24,135
Join the others.

312
01:00:50,177 --> 01:00:54,353
What happened?

313
01:00:55,361 --> 01:00:59,319
They came out of nowhere...

314
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:02,030
Attacked us.

315
01:01:02,342 --> 01:01:05,130
We thought they would kill us all...

316
01:01:05,131 --> 01:01:08,729
But the Colonel stopped them!

317
01:01:09,334 --> 01:01:11,139
There was madness in his eyes!

318
01:01:11,140 --> 01:01:16,962
He said they would use us,
before we died!

319
01:01:16,963 --> 01:01:20,452
And they brought us all here!

320
01:01:21,243 --> 01:01:23,953
Use you?

321
01:01:24,391 --> 01:01:28,101
They've been forcing us to work!

322
01:01:28,102 --> 01:01:30,125
What...

323
01:01:30,126 --> 01:01:32,836
What kind of work?

324
01:01:34,692 --> 01:01:39,202
Wait. My little son is here.

325
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:51,668
Grant...

326
01:01:51,669 --> 01:01:54,816
and Lee.

327
01:01:56,696 --> 01:01:59,406
Wellington...

328
01:02:00,321 --> 01:02:03,031
and Napoleon.

329
01:02:04,679 --> 01:02:07,389
Custer

330
01:02:08,231 --> 01:02:10,941
and Sitting Bull…

331
01:02:12,804 --> 01:02:16,325
You’re probably not much of a reader,

332
01:02:16,731 --> 01:02:20,663
but this is a big moment.

333
01:02:21,109 --> 01:02:23,668
Where were you?

334
01:02:23,669 --> 01:02:28,224
We came upon your herd.
We got lucky.

335
01:02:28,225 --> 01:02:32,101
I was surprised you weren’t with them.

336
01:02:42,254 --> 01:02:46,897
I hope you don’t come to
regret sparing his life.

337
01:02:47,177 --> 01:02:49,887
He's quite a good shot.

338
01:02:55,233 --> 01:02:59,236
Have you finally come
to save your apes?

339
01:02:59,237 --> 01:03:01,837
I came for you.

340
01:03:01,838 --> 01:03:04,548
For me?

341
01:03:05,970 --> 01:03:07,968
Who did I kill that night?

342
01:03:07,969 --> 01:03:11,086
My wife.

343
01:03:11,533 --> 01:03:14,818
My son.

344
01:03:25,546 --> 01:03:27,592
I'm sorry.

345
01:03:27,593 --> 01:03:30,574
I was there for you.

346
01:03:40,752 --> 01:03:43,253
God.

347
01:03:43,254 --> 01:03:46,004
Look at your eyes.

348
01:03:46,191 --> 01:03:48,934
Almost human.

349
01:03:52,047 --> 01:03:57,742
How did you know I was here?
-I was told you were coming.

350
01:03:58,057 --> 01:04:01,147
That more soldiers from the north...

351
01:04:01,148 --> 01:04:04,757
would be joining you here.
-Joining me?

352
01:04:04,758 --> 01:04:07,590
To finish us off.

353
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:10,901
For good.

354
01:04:12,393 --> 01:04:15,103
Who told you that?

355
01:04:23,077 --> 01:04:25,787
Okay.

356
01:04:26,753 --> 01:04:29,463
Let's go.

357
01:05:06,757 --> 01:05:09,467
Father!

358
01:05:10,655 --> 01:05:13,365
Father!

359
01:06:34,327 --> 01:06:36,888
Lake.

360
01:06:37,084 --> 01:06:42,535
Forgive them.
We've been through much.

361
01:06:48,942 --> 01:06:51,811
Father!

362
01:06:52,791 --> 01:06:55,501
What have I done?

363
01:07:33,184 --> 01:07:35,894
Battalion, halt!

364
01:07:40,486 --> 01:07:43,581
Blood!
-Makes the grass grow!

365
01:07:43,582 --> 01:07:46,068
We!
-Make the blood flow!

366
01:07:46,069 --> 01:07:49,823
We are the beginning!
-And the end!

367
01:09:32,118 --> 01:09:35,782
We haven't had food or
water since we got here...

368
01:09:41,137 --> 01:09:43,847
Why do they need a wall?

369
01:10:18,884 --> 01:10:21,163
Donkey!

370
01:10:21,164 --> 01:10:23,918
Get him!
-Okay, okay.

371
01:10:23,919 --> 01:10:26,629
Okay.

372
01:10:54,113 --> 01:10:56,823
Leave him!

373
01:13:34,615 --> 01:13:41,242
Tell them to get back to work.
-Apes need food and water.

374
01:13:43,235 --> 01:13:48,771
Tell them.
-Give them food and water.

375
01:13:56,655 --> 01:13:58,775
Five.

376
01:13:58,776 --> 01:14:01,328
Four.

377
01:14:01,329 --> 01:14:04,039
Three.

378
01:14:04,437 --> 01:14:07,147
Two.

379
01:14:22,995 --> 01:14:27,335
Hurry! Back to work!

380
01:14:43,859 --> 01:14:46,677
String him up, donkey.

381
01:14:55,761 --> 01:14:58,844
Bad place.

382
01:15:00,069 --> 01:15:02,908
Bad, bad place.

383
01:15:04,928 --> 01:15:07,638
What you see?

384
01:15:12,804 --> 01:15:19,640
Must save them! -But how?
-Must think! What would Caesar do?

385
01:15:20,485 --> 01:15:23,195
No!

386
01:15:24,616 --> 01:15:27,326
Why so small?

387
01:15:59,055 --> 01:16:01,791
What did the Colonel promised you?

388
01:16:01,792 --> 01:16:05,957
You really think he let you live?

389
01:16:05,958 --> 01:16:08,668
After we are gone?

390
01:16:08,838 --> 01:16:12,001
You let them call you donkey.

391
01:16:12,002 --> 01:16:14,790
You are ape.

392
01:16:23,467 --> 01:16:27,073
Colonel wants see you.

393
01:16:44,148 --> 01:16:46,945
HISTORY

394
01:16:50,867 --> 01:16:55,393
Interfere with the work again, I will
begin slaughtering the apes, one by one.

395
01:16:55,394 --> 01:16:57,630
Understand?
I need that wall.

396
01:16:57,631 --> 01:17:04,991
Apes need food and water. -They'll get
food and water when they finish their work.

397
01:17:06,651 --> 01:17:09,584
Give apes food and water.

398
01:17:09,585 --> 01:17:14,318
Or they cannot finish it.
-You know, you're very emotional.

399
01:17:16,023 --> 01:17:20,856
What makes you think you’re
in a position to make demands?

400
01:17:25,270 --> 01:17:28,632
Okay, let's go.
-The soldiers who are coming here,

401
01:17:28,633 --> 01:17:32,904
they are not coming
to join you, are they?

402
01:17:33,299 --> 01:17:39,133
I saw men outside, on the wall,
preparing for battle.

403
01:17:40,740 --> 01:17:45,552
They told me you're smart,
but that's impressive.

404
01:17:45,553 --> 01:17:49,303
No, they won't be joining me.

405
01:17:49,304 --> 01:17:51,016
They are against you?

406
01:17:51,017 --> 01:17:54,160
They fear me.

407
01:17:54,161 --> 01:17:58,328
Why?
Because you kill your own men?

408
01:17:58,760 --> 01:18:01,078
We found bodies.

409
01:18:01,079 --> 01:18:05,467
Something wrong with these men.

410
01:18:07,718 --> 01:18:11,517
Jesus Christ, you are impressive.

411
01:18:12,603 --> 01:18:16,836
You paint quite a picture.
What you must think of me.

412
01:18:17,139 --> 01:18:20,631
I think you have no mercy.

413
01:18:38,300 --> 01:18:41,010
You came here to kill me.

414
01:18:41,649 --> 01:18:43,629
Were you going to show me mercy?

415
01:18:43,630 --> 01:18:48,394
I showed you mercy
when I spared your men.

416
01:18:48,395 --> 01:18:53,513
I offered you peace
and you killed my family.

417
01:19:07,803 --> 01:19:10,149
Mercy.

418
01:19:10,150 --> 01:19:14,408
Do you have any idea what
your mercy would do to us?

419
01:19:17,460 --> 01:19:20,428
You’re much stronger than we are.

420
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:22,889
You're smart as hell.

421
01:19:22,890 --> 01:19:28,286
No matter what you say, you’d eventually
replace us. That’s the law of Nature.

422
01:19:28,418 --> 01:19:30,557
The irony is, we created you.

423
01:19:30,558 --> 01:19:33,680
We tried to defy Nature, bend it to our will.

424
01:19:33,681 --> 01:19:38,997
And Nature’s been punishing us
for our arrogance ever since.

425
01:19:41,229 --> 01:19:44,705
Ten months ago, I sent out
recon units to look for your base.

426
01:19:44,706 --> 01:19:48,342
My own son was a soldier
with one of the units.

427
01:19:48,343 --> 01:19:50,636
One day he suddenly stopped speaking.

428
01:19:50,637 --> 01:19:53,278
He became primitive, like an animal.

429
01:19:53,279 --> 01:19:57,777
They contacted me, said that
they thought he’d lost his mind,

430
01:19:57,884 --> 01:20:00,901
that the war was too much for him.

431
01:20:01,076 --> 01:20:05,095
Then the man who cared for
him stopped speaking too.

432
01:20:05,444 --> 01:20:10,119
Their medic had a theory,
before he stopped speaking,

433
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:12,783
that the virus that
almost wiped us out,

434
01:20:12,784 --> 01:20:17,161
the virus that every human
survivor still carries,

435
01:20:17,162 --> 01:20:19,473
had suddenly changed.

436
01:20:19,474 --> 01:20:22,184
Mutated.

437
01:20:22,554 --> 01:20:27,997
And if it spread, it would destroy
humanity for good this time.

438
01:20:29,275 --> 01:20:34,925
Not by killing us, but by robbing
us of the things that make us human.

439
01:20:34,926 --> 01:20:37,702
Our speech, our higher thinking.

440
01:20:37,703 --> 01:20:42,555
It would turn us into
beasts. You talk about mercy?

441
01:20:44,384 --> 01:20:47,094
What would you have done?

442
01:20:49,209 --> 01:20:52,091
It was a moment of clarity for me.

443
01:20:52,092 --> 01:20:56,323
I realized that I would have
to sacrifice my only son,

444
01:20:56,324 --> 01:21:00,286
so that humanity could be saved.

445
01:21:02,314 --> 01:21:07,876
I held that gun in my
hand for a long time...

446
01:21:11,476 --> 01:21:16,622
And I pointed it at my only child.

447
01:21:18,057 --> 01:21:24,050
He looked at me with
trust in his eyes.

448
01:21:25,787 --> 01:21:28,964
Even in his primitive gaze,

449
01:21:33,131 --> 01:21:35,862
I felt his...

450
01:21:35,915 --> 01:21:38,625
love.

451
01:21:44,292 --> 01:21:47,417
I pulled the trigger.

452
01:21:48,422 --> 01:21:54,524
It purified me.
It made my purpose clear.

453
01:21:55,925 --> 01:22:00,110
I gave orders to kill the
others infected, all of them.

454
01:22:00,111 --> 01:22:04,990
Burn their belongings, anything
that might spread contamination.

455
01:22:04,991 --> 01:22:07,522
Some of the men
questioned my judgment.

456
01:22:07,523 --> 01:22:10,645
I was asking them to
do what I had done,

457
01:22:10,646 --> 01:22:16,570
to sacrifice their friends, their family.

458
01:22:18,281 --> 01:22:21,515
Of course, they refused.

459
01:22:23,545 --> 01:22:26,255
I had them killed too.

460
01:22:27,429 --> 01:22:32,647
Others with children
deserted into the woods.

461
01:22:33,133 --> 01:22:37,148
One of those cowards fled
to my superiors up north.

462
01:22:37,149 --> 01:22:42,480
They tried to convince me that this
plague could be dealt with medically.

463
01:22:42,481 --> 01:22:49,177
That’s when I realized that they
had learned nothing from our past.

464
01:22:50,436 --> 01:22:53,404
You killed them too?

465
01:22:54,673 --> 01:22:57,383
What did I do, Preacher?

466
01:22:57,821 --> 01:23:00,464
You severed their heads, sir.

467
01:23:00,465 --> 01:23:02,822
Except for the one I spared

468
01:23:02,823 --> 01:23:05,936
so he could return
and deliver a message.

469
01:23:05,937 --> 01:23:08,746
If they wanted to
relieve me of my command,

470
01:23:08,747 --> 01:23:13,343
they’d have to meet me
here, and do it themselves.

471
01:23:13,344 --> 01:23:16,154
This used to be a weapons depot.

472
01:23:16,203 --> 01:23:20,985
They turned it into a relocation camp
when the crisis was just beginning.

473
01:23:21,479 --> 01:23:25,861
But the weapons are all still
here, inside the mountain.

474
01:23:25,862 --> 01:23:29,365
How many men will be coming?

475
01:23:29,366 --> 01:23:31,072
Probably all of them.

476
01:23:31,073 --> 01:23:33,137
But don’t get any ideas,

477
01:23:33,138 --> 01:23:36,588
the only thing they fear
more than me is you apes.

478
01:23:43,129 --> 01:23:47,789
This is a holy war.

479
01:23:48,667 --> 01:23:53,161
All of human history
has led to this moment.

480
01:23:53,162 --> 01:23:58,168
If we lose, we’ll be
the last of our kind.

481
01:23:58,428 --> 01:24:05,197
It will be a planet of apes,
and we’ll become your cattle

482
01:24:06,182 --> 01:24:08,892
Look at you.

483
01:24:08,893 --> 01:24:11,726
You think I am sick, don't you?

484
01:24:19,793 --> 01:24:22,769
I didn’t mean to kill your son.

485
01:24:24,383 --> 01:24:29,010
But if his destiny was to
inherit your unholy kingdom...

486
01:24:30,043 --> 01:24:32,753
I am glad I did.

487
01:24:34,245 --> 01:24:36,955
Get back!

488
01:24:44,743 --> 01:24:47,453
So emotional!

489
01:24:54,074 --> 01:24:56,966
I see how conflicted you are.

490
01:24:57,279 --> 01:25:00,674
You are confused in your purpose.

491
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:06,022
You’re angry at me for something
I did that was an act of war.

492
01:25:06,201 --> 01:25:10,693
But you’re taking this
all much far too personally.

493
01:25:12,539 --> 01:25:17,450
What do you think my men
would have done to your apes,

494
01:25:17,451 --> 01:25:20,246
if you had killed me?

495
01:25:20,727 --> 01:25:23,488
Or is killing me more important?

496
01:25:35,497 --> 01:25:40,094
Soldiers everywhere!
How will we get in?

497
01:25:40,418 --> 01:25:45,234
Must get in somehow...
Must get in!

498
01:25:46,338 --> 01:25:48,651
In? In?

499
01:25:48,652 --> 01:25:50,552
No!

500
01:25:50,553 --> 01:25:53,703
No go in! No!

501
01:26:00,537 --> 01:26:04,203
Friends! Friends! No!
No go in!

502
01:26:04,204 --> 01:26:06,914
No go in!

503
01:26:09,036 --> 01:26:12,059
Friend! Friend!

504
01:26:15,394 --> 01:26:18,601
Thank you. Thank you, friend.

505
01:27:03,944 --> 01:27:07,356
You save our lives!

506
01:27:47,234 --> 01:27:53,228
Sick humans must have
escaped down here!

507
01:27:56,977 --> 01:28:03,327
No, no!
No, no climb! No!

508
01:28:16,106 --> 01:28:19,565
What? What you see?

509
01:28:23,142 --> 01:28:25,697
APE-POCALYPSE
NOW

510
01:28:25,698 --> 01:28:28,485
Wonder where we are.

511
01:28:52,271 --> 01:28:55,329
No! Friend...

512
01:28:58,635 --> 01:29:00,964
No!

513
01:29:00,965 --> 01:29:02,984
No!

514
01:29:02,985 --> 01:29:05,185
No! No!

515
01:29:05,186 --> 01:29:07,896
No! Come, come!

516
01:29:11,359 --> 01:29:14,586
Come! Come, come.

517
01:29:14,587 --> 01:29:16,560
No! Come!

518
01:29:16,561 --> 01:29:19,271
Come! Come, come!

519
01:29:50,659 --> 01:29:53,369
Koba...

520
01:29:57,662 --> 01:29:59,895
Sleep.

521
01:29:59,896 --> 01:30:03,147
You cannot save them.

522
01:30:04,195 --> 01:30:08,466
Apes all die here.

523
01:30:10,808 --> 01:30:13,538
No!
-Yes.

524
01:30:15,326 --> 01:30:18,130
Join me...

525
01:30:34,856 --> 01:30:37,566
If he's still alive in the morning...

526
01:30:42,207 --> 01:30:45,896
He goes back to work as everyone else.

527
01:30:45,897 --> 01:30:48,448
Or you shoot him.

528
01:30:48,449 --> 01:30:52,439
Come. Come. Come.

529
01:30:55,089 --> 01:30:57,799
She go in!

530
01:32:04,368 --> 01:32:07,861
Thirsty?

531
01:34:23,450 --> 01:34:27,490
Hide. Quick.

532
01:34:36,154 --> 01:34:39,182
Humans will kill her!

533
01:34:39,789 --> 01:34:43,002
I know what to do! Go!

534
01:36:15,178 --> 01:36:17,888
Are there others out there?

535
01:36:24,795 --> 01:36:27,505
Sweep the area.

536
01:36:27,558 --> 01:36:30,268
Put him in the pen.

537
01:37:11,906 --> 01:37:16,473
Feeling better?

538
01:37:20,682 --> 01:37:26,639
Good. Then we can talk about escape.

539
01:37:26,640 --> 01:37:29,740
Apes together strong!

540
01:37:38,036 --> 01:37:41,434
We are the beginning!
-And the end!

541
01:38:04,432 --> 01:38:07,142
Still alive.

542
01:38:37,620 --> 01:38:40,498
Send him to the quarry.
Alone.

543
01:38:43,012 --> 01:38:45,791
Hold on.

544
01:39:03,294 --> 01:39:06,004
What is this?

545
01:39:09,209 --> 01:39:11,919
How did this get in there?

546
01:39:14,095 --> 01:39:16,805
Get him to work.

547
01:39:28,922 --> 01:39:31,632
Thirty-seven.

548
01:39:41,262 --> 01:39:43,972
Fifty-five.

549
01:39:44,751 --> 01:39:47,125
Thirty-seven steps to the adult cage.

550
01:39:47,126 --> 01:39:50,241
Fifty-five to the children.

551
01:40:23,598 --> 01:40:27,057
DONKEY

552
01:40:28,577 --> 01:40:35,264
You know, Colonel shoot apes
when wall is done.

553
01:40:37,902 --> 01:40:42,016
This wall is madness.

554
01:40:42,017 --> 01:40:44,909
It won't save him.

555
01:40:45,506 --> 01:40:47,948
Anymore that it will save you.

556
01:40:47,949 --> 01:40:50,744
I save myself.

557
01:40:50,745 --> 01:40:56,899
Is there anything left of you to safe?

558
01:41:18,111 --> 01:41:20,821
Up!

559
01:41:36,703 --> 01:41:39,413
Apes going back to the cage?

560
01:41:42,391 --> 01:41:46,976
You are very brave.

561
01:41:47,076 --> 01:41:50,218
Brave?
-Brave!

562
01:41:50,219 --> 01:41:52,929
Brave!

563
01:41:56,833 --> 01:41:59,543
Ape?

564
01:42:00,355 --> 01:42:04,078
Me? Ape?

565
01:42:10,999 --> 01:42:13,709
You are...

566
01:42:24,767 --> 01:42:27,477
Nova.

567
01:42:28,833 --> 01:42:31,543
Nova.

568
01:42:41,508 --> 01:42:43,623
Come! Come! Come to see!

569
01:42:43,624 --> 01:42:45,679
Come to see!

570
01:42:45,680 --> 01:42:48,932
Come! Come to see!

571
01:43:03,136 --> 01:43:08,680
34, 35, 36, 37! 30!
37!

572
01:43:10,791 --> 01:43:13,501
I do.

573
01:43:14,660 --> 01:43:17,370
What now?

574
01:43:24,867 --> 01:43:27,577
What?

575
01:43:32,609 --> 01:43:34,985
No!

576
01:43:34,986 --> 01:43:36,688
No!

577
01:43:36,689 --> 01:43:40,986
No, no! No, no!

578
01:43:44,725 --> 01:43:47,435
Okay.

579
01:44:51,756 --> 01:44:55,408
This is the ape I told you about!

580
01:44:56,317 --> 01:44:59,204
Thank you.

581
01:45:15,426 --> 01:45:18,163
Bad Ape.

582
01:45:19,076 --> 01:45:21,786
Bad Ape.

583
01:45:22,582 --> 01:45:25,292
Bad... Bad Ape.

584
01:45:36,917 --> 01:45:39,768
What's wrong?

585
01:45:58,446 --> 01:46:01,841
We can't keep digging!
It will flood the whole tunnel!

586
01:46:01,842 --> 01:46:05,783
If we don't,
we can't reach the children!

587
01:46:24,321 --> 01:46:26,256
We must keep looking down there...

588
01:46:26,257 --> 01:46:28,491
Find another way to
reach the children.

589
01:46:28,492 --> 01:46:32,723
We must leave now!
More soldiers are coming!

590
01:46:32,724 --> 01:46:37,543
Humans will destroy each other!
And us with them!

591
01:46:41,282 --> 01:46:43,992
We’ll have to get the
children out above ground.

592
01:46:44,033 --> 01:46:46,743
How?

593
01:47:21,869 --> 01:47:24,579
You animals!

594
01:47:43,693 --> 01:47:45,879
Who did that?

595
01:47:45,880 --> 01:47:48,590
Who did that?

596
01:47:52,143 --> 01:47:54,853
Who was it?

597
01:48:01,246 --> 01:48:03,956
Was it you?

598
01:49:55,531 --> 01:49:58,913
I love you, son.

599
01:51:07,568 --> 01:51:10,278
Go, go.

600
01:51:26,112 --> 01:51:28,822
Hurry! Let's go!

601
01:51:32,375 --> 01:51:35,287
Caesar, what's wrong?

602
01:51:45,267 --> 01:51:47,749
Hurry. You must go.

603
01:51:47,750 --> 01:51:50,226
Without you?

604
01:51:50,227 --> 01:51:52,140
No.

605
01:51:52,141 --> 01:51:54,851
Maurice was right.

606
01:51:58,660 --> 01:52:03,728
I am like Koba.

607
01:52:03,729 --> 01:52:08,655
He could not escape his hate.

608
01:52:14,040 --> 01:52:17,386
And I still cannot escape mine.

609
01:52:22,675 --> 01:52:27,882
Move! Go, go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

610
01:53:11,132 --> 01:53:14,300
Colonel! Colonel!

611
01:53:15,734 --> 01:53:18,444
Where the hell is he?

612
01:58:03,846 --> 01:58:06,556
Hurry up!

613
01:59:01,643 --> 01:59:05,637
Colonel, are you in there?
Colonel?

614
01:59:46,346 --> 01:59:49,781
Donkey! Grenade launcher!

615
02:00:46,219 --> 02:00:49,920
God damn it, donkey!
Get me the launcher!

616
02:01:38,566 --> 02:01:41,775
THE BEGINNING
THE END

617
02:09:08,716 --> 02:09:12,339
Don't worry.

618
02:09:16,338 --> 02:09:19,048
Don't worry.

619
02:09:22,531 --> 02:09:25,934
Maurice...

620
02:09:27,680 --> 02:09:33,782
You are home now.

621
02:09:35,889 --> 02:09:39,381
Apes are strong...

622
02:09:42,452 --> 02:09:47,954
With or without me.

623
02:10:14,126 --> 02:10:21,384
Son will know...

624
02:10:21,715 --> 02:10:29,632
who was father.

625
02:10:38,978 --> 02:10:43,284
And what...

626
02:10:43,285 --> 02:10:48,948
Caesar did...

627
02:10:50,501 --> 02:10:53,545
for us.

628
02:11:57,501 --> 02:12:00,664
Caesar...
