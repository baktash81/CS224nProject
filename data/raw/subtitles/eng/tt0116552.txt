<i>I had never seen anything</i>

483
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,720
<i>It was huge.</i>

484
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,600
<i>I had no idea what to expect,</i>

485
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,400
<i>Shadow kept insisting</i>

486
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,120
<i>But, I don't know,</i>

487
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,040
<i>we were just</i>

488
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,960
<i>Which, to be honest,</i>

489
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,240
<i>Heck, I was in no hurry.</i>

490
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,440
<i>Why should I rush home?</i>
<i>So Jamie could ignore me?</i>

491
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,080
<i>Nah, I was enjoying</i>

492
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,400

CHANCE: What's this?

494
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,600
The old nose radar is pickin' up
some pretty strong signals here.

495
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,040
(SNIFFING)
Mmm, I'm getting warm.

496
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,280
Gettin' warmer, warmer.

497
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,480
Whoa! It's a buffet.

Hey, Shadow, you're a retriever.

500
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,440
Fetch me a lemon wedge,
would you?

501
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,640
Oh, my favorite. Sushi!
(MEOWS)

502
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,720

check out the dessert tray.

Sha!

504
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,720
Ah, fine. Didn't look
fresh to me anyway, crabby!

We're all still hungry, Sassy.

Better get used to it, babe.

508

Only the strong survive.

SHADOW: Will you two
quit bickering?

511
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,200
Okay, fine, I'll just starve.

512
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,440
Or not! Where there's a cat...

513
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:01,720
-Hi, Tiger.
-...there's cat food.

514
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,360
-Stand back, boys,
and watch a pro.
-This I gotta see.

Oh.

00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,720
First you bound up,
acting like you really
want to see him.

517
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,280
Then make your
cautious approach.

518
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,600
-Hi.
-Yes...

519
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:15,560
-Isn't my fur long and silky?
-Nice kitty.

-It's a kitty, like you.

00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,600
I don't believe it.
The kid's actually buying it.

523
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,920
-Heck, I can do this.
-Chance!

524
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,840
-Hey, kid.
I'm a pretty kitty too, see?

-SASSY: Beat it, moron!
-WOMAN: Bad dog. Go away!

528

-Meow. Ahem, meow!
-Go away!

00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:42,080
-SASSY: "Meow"?
-CHANCE: Lady, wait! Meow!

00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,840
Ugh! I can't believe
I said that.

Chance...

532
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,840
Whoa, she must
really hate cats.

533
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
-Only cats that look like you!
-Way to go, pup.

534
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,960
-They were about to feed me!
-Oh, just face it,
they didn't buy your act.

535
00:27:56,160 --> 00:28:00,480
He was charmed by me.
He was heading for the
can opener, and you blew it.

00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,440
SASSY: Oh, Shadow!

537
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,880
Attila the Hungry
here has ruined everything.

538
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,600
We'll find food as we go.
We've gotta keep moving.

539
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:11,040
Yeah, keep movin'.
That's what I was
tryin' to tell her, Shadow.

540
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:15,120
-She... she's such
a time-waster.
-Me? I'm a time-waster? Ha!

541
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,800
SASSY: Who took half a year
to paper train?

00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,040
CHANCE: Oh, that's so funny
I forgot to bark.

543
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,520
SHADOW:
We have to find that bridge.
It must be around somewhere.

544
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,520
SASSY: I don't see
why we can't just stop
and ask for directions.

545
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:30,480
CHANCE: Will you listen to her?
Listen, Sassy, we're guys. Okay?

546
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,720
We don't ask for directions.
We don't need 'em.

547
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35,880
We know where we're goin'
every step of the... (GRUNTS)

Woo-hoo! Whoa!

No offense, dude,
but you need a bath!

00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,560
Hey, boss,
what's all the ruckus?

551
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,320
Yo, Pete, these runts
just trespassed on our turf.

552
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,600
Excuse us.
We're not from around here.

553
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,560
That so?
They're not from around here.

554
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,760
Where are you from?
Planet Stupid?

555
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:58,320
Look, they brought their
pretty little kitty too.

556
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,880

with the cat but me!

-Don't lay a paw on her.
-Who's gonna stop me, old timer?

was a long, furry thing

-Huh?

-Yo, boss, it's Riley's gang.

00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,160
Hey, hot stuff,
why don't you butt out?

-Are you lookin' to get fixed?
-Ha-ha! Good one, Delilah.

stay off my turf, chump!

Sassy, can you get away?

580
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,800
Not with old...

-Are you still there, kitty?
-Oh, duh!

Don't worry, lady,
I'll save you.

-Hey, Pete!
-What is that pup doing?

584
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:17,400
-Bonehead, come get me.
-Whoa, bombs away!

00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,080
I see, the old
"geranium to the cranium."

-Whoopsie!
-Ow!

fighting, stranger.

This ain't over yet, Goldie.
Watch your back.

590
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,720
PETE: Yeah, your back.

00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,920
RILEY: I hope you're not
makin' threats, Trash-can.

592
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,640
Unless you want
to wake up at the vet's.

Yo, what's up with you?

00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,840
Don't you know this place
ain't safe for no... pets?

597
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,520
Yes. Unfortunately, we're lost.

598
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,240
Do you think we came here
on purpose? Guess again.

599
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,400
Ooh, excuse me!

600
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,560
My name's Riley,
but you can call me Riley.

That's Sassy. I'm Shadow.

Wait a minute now.
Wasn't there another
one of you pets?

603
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:06,080
Oh, boy, this decoy business
is tough work.

00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:09,240
They gotta be right behind me.
Paws, don't fail me now.

00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,600
quit scratchin' when
you're tryin' to talk.

Dang! While we're young, dog!

611
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:29,000
He went up the, uh,
south s-s-si-i-ide...

612
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,880
Chill! He went up
the south side alley.

00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,560
-(SIGHS) Precisely.
-Yo, Delilah, come here.

Look, she knows the south side.
If anybody can find
your friend, she will.

615
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,000
I hope you can catch him.
He's fast.

616
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,720
Well, so am I.
Back in a flash.

617
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,640
Hey, where'd Delilah go?

618
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:54,560
Get a grip, Bando.
She just went
to go find their friend.

619
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,400
But she's my girlfriend.

620
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,640
Yeah, right.
Not in this lifetime.

621
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,920

00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:11,600
Yes, I did it! I outfoxed them!
I mean, I out-dogged them.

624
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,680
I faced danger,
and I sniffed its butt.

625
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:16,160
What a rush!
What excitement! What...

626
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,360

around here for? Oh! Oh!

Come on, Chance, move!

630
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:36,320
Okay, time to break out
the fancy moves.

631
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:40,760
This is crazy!
What did that dog eat
for breakfast, jet fuel?

632
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:45,800
Oh, this kid is fast,
but not fast enough.

633
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,560
Cute butt.

Ooh, ahh, ahh!
Front leg cramp.

Ooh, back leg cramp.

-You're a girl?
-Yep.

you're all mine.

in for the kill.

found their friend yet.

out there, right?

leave Chance out there.

Delilah's found him?

658

What if she didn't find him?
Or worse, what if she did?
Oh, no!

-Don't you "hi" me.

-Game? I don't have a game.

Look, I was only chasing you
because your friends back in
the alley asked me to, okay?

My friends, huh?
So tell me, what are
my friends' names?

They didn't show me
any secret paw shake.

A-ha, they didn't, huh?
Good, 'cause there ain't one.

00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,480
Now explain that kiss.

669
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:01,280
Kiss? That was no kiss.
Friendly lick, maybe.

They want you, pet.

you never come back.

a lot about this city.

We need to cross

Do you know where that is?

I know where it is,
but I ain't goin' there.

695

and we don't like the man.

Guess we'll have to find
that bridge on our own.

Face it, they don't want you.

of those humans.

they seem.

I could trust Jamie.

755
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,960
He rescued me from
the bad place.

756
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,080
He takes me for walks,
he lets me eat off his plate.

757
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,160
-He gave me a home.
-DELILAH: Let me
tell you something.

758
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,880
When Riley was a puppy,

759
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,280
he thought he found
a home with humans too.

760
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,720
<i>They tied a ribbon</i>
<i>to his collar...</i>

761
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,400
<i>and they put him in</i>
<i>a big basket underneath a tree.</i>

762
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:21,560
<i>But the little boy, he didn't</i>
<i>seem to like Riley very much.</i>

763
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:25,320
<i>He didn't want to hold him,</i>
<i>or play with him, or anything.</i>

764
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:29,200
<i>So later, they drove</i>
<i>into the city</i>

765
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,800
<i>and they left Riley</i>
<i>in the gutter</i>

766
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:35,120
<i>on the coldest,</i>
<i>rainiest night of the year.</i>

767
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,280
So Riley found
other abandoned dogs...

768
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,760
and he made a home for them,
to protect them from all humans.

769
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:51,920
They got rid of Riley
just 'cause the kid
didn't want to play with him?

770
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,880
Huh. Jamie's getting
tired of playing with me.

771
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,400
-Uh-oh.
-You don't think?

772
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,760
I don't know, Chance.

773
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:01,360
All I know is,
I don't trust humans.

774
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,320
And I don't know
any dog that does.

775
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:06,000
Why? What'd your
humans do to you?

776
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,120
Me? Oh, I never had humans.

777
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,640
I was born a stray.

778
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:30,160
<i>Poor Delilah. No wonder</i>
<i>she doesn't trust humans.</i>

779
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,680
<i>She's never had any.</i>

780
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,320
<i>She doesn't know how great</i>
<i>it can be havin' a family,</i>

781
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,520
<i>havin' somebody there</i>
<i>to look out for you.</i>

782
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,000
Got ya!

783
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,520
Delilah, I...

784
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:56,280
Well, I just wanted to tell you
that, uh...

785
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:00,400
-Oh, here.
-Oh, Chance, you're sweet.

786
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:06,200
Yep, that's right:
an American bulldog,
a golden retriever

787
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:08,800
and a Himalayan cat.

788
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:14,160
Right, right.
I talked to you last night.
No. No reports so far, sir.

789
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,720
What are the chances
of finding these animals?

790
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,480
Uh, realistically? One in ten.

791
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,400
I mean,
it's a big city out there.

792
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,680
You got cars and trucks,
trains and trolleys.

793
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:31,200
There are animal science labs,
other strays.
You got your wackos.

794
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,760
I mean, there's a million things
that can do major harm

as long as you like.

961
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:57,520
SHADOW: Thanks, Riley.
You're very kind.

962
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:58,800
SASSY:
Right, if he's so kind,

963
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:00,240
why doesn't he help us
find that bridge?

964
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:03,120
SHADOW: We can't leave
until we find Chance.

965
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:06,200
-Why not?
-You know you miss him.

966
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:09,200
Okay, I miss his stupid jokes
and his stupid face...

967
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:11,200
and his stupid stupidness.

968
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:13,160
SHADOW: Oh, Sassy, stop it.

969
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:16,480
And I'm stupidly starting
to worry about him.

970
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,280
RILEY: What...
What in the world is goin' on?

971
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:41,800
SLEDGE:
Ooh, check it out!

972
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:45,280
<i>♪ Chance and Delilah</i>
<i>sniffin' at a tree, K-I-S... ♪</i>

973
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:46,480
RILEY: Chill out, Sledge.

974
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:50,120
Hey, guys. (YAWNING)
Where you been?

975
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:52,400
-Chance!
-SASSY: Let me at him!

976
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:54,400
I'm gonna use his nose
as a scratch post!

977
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:56,440
We looked everywhere for you!

978
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:58,320
-CHANCE: Well, here I am.
-SPIKE: Eew!

979
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:01,320
They were probably
kissing and stuff. Gross!

980
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:05,040
Dee, you go, girl!
Looks like he got it goin' on.

981
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:08,040
No way,
he's all b-b-b-b-b...

982
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:10,840
b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b...

983
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:12,320
bark...

984
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:15,080
-and no b-b-b-b-b...
-Oh, here we go.

985
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:17,480
...b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b...

986
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:20,040
-"Bite", fool.
-Exactly!

987
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:23,720
But, Delilah, I thought...
What about me?

988
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:27,560
-Who are you?
-I'm her... I mean,
I was gonna be her...

989
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:31,000
Ah, Bando, face it.
You ain't nothin'
but a hound dog.

990
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:34,200
Bando, I told you,
you and I are just friends.

991
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:36,320
Huh? But, Delilah...

992
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:39,280
-What? Catch a clue, Opie.
-Why, you little...

993
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:41,520
Maybe someone should
take you for a walk, pal.

994
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:43,960
-Bando, knock it off!
-Sorry, Riley.

995
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:45,360
I wasn't tryin'
to start somethin'.

996
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:48,200
I'm done. I'm calm.
Stupid lost dog

997
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:50,760
comes along tryin' to steal
my woman. Home wrecker.

998
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:53,080
RILEY:
What's up with this, girl?
I know you can't be serious.

999
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:55,240
-But, Riley...
-But nothin', Delilah.

1000
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:57,960
-The dude's a pet.
-What's that supposed to mean?

1001
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:00,520
DELILAH: Come on, Chance.
We don't need to take this.

1002
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:03,000
I should have known
they wouldn't understand.

1003
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:06,280
-RILEY: Shadow,
we got us a problem.
-Yep.

1004
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:09,800
DELILAH: Oh, that Riley's
got a lot of nerve.

1005
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:12,280
I mean, I can't believe
he called you a pet.

1006
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:14,240
CHANCE: But... I am a pet.

1007
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:17,080
DELILAH: Yeah, but I...
I know you're more than that.

1008
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:19,920
I mean, look how much fun
you've been having today
in the city.

1009
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,640
-It's almost like you're...
-Like... what?

1010
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:26,640
-Like you're a natural,
a city dog.
-Yeah, I feel that too.

1011
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:29,240
DELILAH: We had fun today.
We could have fun tomorrow.

1012
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:31,800
CHANCE:
Tomorrow's wide open for me.

1013
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,440
-DELILAH: So that's a yes?
-Totally.

1014
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:35,640
CHANCE: Oh, wow, Delilah,
this is gonna be great.

1015
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:38,920
You and me,
together in the city.
Forget about it.

1016
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:41,280
-Oh, but...
-What? What's wrong?

1017
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:44,040
-Well, it's Jamie.
-What about him?

1018
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:47,040
If I stay here,
what's gonna happen to him?

1019
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:49,760
You said yourself he hasn't
had time for you lately.

1020
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,880
Well, yeah,
but I still kind of miss him.

1021
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:54,400
I can't tell you
what to do, Chance.

1022
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:58,160
All I know is I never really
felt this way before.

1023
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:01,520
Me either. I...
I wanted to say the same thing
to you all day,

1024
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:02,960
but then I thought
you'd laugh at me,

1025
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:04,280
and then I'd really feel
like a dork.

1026
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:06,440
-(LAUGHING)
-Geez, you are laughing at me.

1027
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:09,880
No, I'm laughing with you.
(LAUGHING)

1028
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:11,920
-I knew that.
-(LAUGHING CONTINUES)

1029
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:16,920
(BOTH LAUGHING)

1030
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:27,120
Okay. Thanks.

1031
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:34,680
WOMAN: (OVER P.A.)
<i>Due to the weather conditions,</i>

1032
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:37,360
<i>all arrivals and departures</i>

1033
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:39,080
<i>Thank you for your patience.</i>

1034
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:50,160
Okay, Mom, let's just say
I was worried about Chance.
Think I'll ever see him again?

1035
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:55,440
Oh, honey, they found
their way home once before.
They can do it again.

1036
00:54:57,320 --> 00:54:58,800
I hope so.

1037
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:03,680
I'm really sorry for being
such a big jerk lately.

1038
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:07,360
-Oh. Go to sleep, sweetie.
-Okay.

1039
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:09,600
We'll be home soon.

1040
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,000
(WATER DRIPPING)

1041
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,200
Oh, a bath! A facial!

1042
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:22,680
-A dog? Oh!
-Huh?

1043
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:26,120
You're the ugliest thing
I've ever seen.

1044
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:28,160
Yeah? Well, that's not what
you said last night, toots.

1045
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:30,240
Ugh, I feel faint. Ugh!

1046
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:33,920
CHANCE: Hey, Delilah,
get a load of that!
It's a doughnut!

1047
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,200
It's a big rubber do...
No, it's a throne!
It's the doughnut throne!

1048
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:38,880
Hey, I'm the doughnut king!
(BARKING)

1049
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:41,280
SLEDGE:
Yo, this brother's trippin'.
He's kinda cute, though.

1050
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:43,640
Give me your glazed,
your jelly,

1051
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:45,200
your cinnamon crullers
yearning to be dunked!

1052
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:47,800
Shadow, what you did
back at that fire,

1053
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,600
well, that was
pretty righteous, man.

1054
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:54,640
So, if humans mean
that much to you,
I'll take you all to the bridge.

1055
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:56,080
That's great, Riley.

1056
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:59,480
Now I just have to get
Chance to come along.

1057
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:01,440
I was wrong.
This isn't a throne.

1058
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:02,880
It's the world's biggest
chew toy.

1059
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:05,280
(LAUGHS) Chance,
we should probably head back in.

1060
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:08,520
(BARKING) Heads up!
Air raid, two o'clock!

1061
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:12,120
Delilah, cover my wing!
Assume attack formation!

1062
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:15,120
(IMITATES AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE)

1063
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:18,720
CHANCE: Take that! Ha!
Whoa, spoils of war!

1064
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:20,760
Delilah, come here.
Get your share.

1065
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:23,360
-SHADOW: Hello, Delilah.
-Oh, hi.

1066
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:25,440
SHADOW: I need to talk to you
about Chance.

1067
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:26,440
Oh?

1068
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:28,120
He's not like you.

1069
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:30,360
He's not like any
of the other strays.

1070
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:33,480
-Yeah, I know he's different.
-You have to let him go.

1071
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:36,000
Let him go?
What are you talking about?

1072
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:38,560
He doesn't have what it takes
to survive in the city.

1073
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:40,480
Everything's a game to him.

1074
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:42,040
But I can take care of him.

1075
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:44,200
This is a dangerous place,
Delilah.

1076
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:46,560
You won't always be able
to be there for him.

1077
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:48,720
You know, you're starting
to sound like Riley.

1078
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:50,560
I said I can take care of him.

1079
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:53,720
Well, I hope you're right...
for his sake.

1080
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:55,440
(EXASPERATED SIGH)

1081
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:57,760
You know, you could've been
a contender. But look at you.

1082
00:56:57,840 --> 00:56:59,960
You're a bag of trash.
You're a disgrace.

1083
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:02,480
Ding, ding, ding, ding!
At the start of round two,

1084
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:04,800
the garbage is starting
to fight back.

1085
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:07,720
Chance is up against the ropes,
but he ducks! He gives a left!

1086
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:10,920
-(CHUCKLING) What are you doing?
-CHANCE: He won't let go!

1087
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:13,600
SLEDGE: Oh, no,
it's the blood-red van!

1088
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:16,560
-Chance, come on!
-SLEDGE: Everybody, run!

1089
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:19,880
Quick, hide!

1090
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:23,920
Hurry, upstairs!

1091
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:26,240
Uh-oh.

1092
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:36,880
Mmm! Wow, that was
worth fighting for. Mmm.

1093
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:40,320
Chance?
Guys, is Chance up here?

1094
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:41,720
Oh, no.

1095
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:50,160
SASSY: Shadow, those men
are gonna get Chance.

1096
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:52,560
(SNIFFING) Wait a minute.
Do I smell a cheeseburger?

1097
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:54,680
All right, come out
with your buns up.

1098
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:57,400
-All right, Jack, here it is.
-Oh, no, Ralph.

1099
00:57:57,880 --> 00:58:00,320
This is your moment
in the spotlight.

1100
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:02,200
-Me?
-Yes, you.

1101
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:03,280
I don't know...

1102
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:05,960
Just look at him, Ralph.

1103
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:09,160
A big, juicy cherry
just waiting to be plucked.

1104
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:10,680
Turn around! Turn around!

1105
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:12,920
DELILAH: I'm so sorry.
I thought he
was right behind me.

1106
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:16,760
-Chance, run.
-SPIKE: He's a goner.

1107
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:19,640
Where is it? Hey!

1108
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:22,640
-Hey, buddy.
-Who are you guys?

1109
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:25,080
Wanna go on a ride?
Wanna go on a ride
with us, doggy?

1110
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:27,480
We got a lot of nice
other dogs in there.

1111
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:31,000
-Ah, big boy has the burger.
-And they call me stupid.

1112
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:33,800
-Jack, this ain't workin'.
-Shh! Stay.

1113
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:36,720
Stay.

1114
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:41,240
What a handsome
young man we are.

1115
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:44,080
-Who? Me?
-Yes, I'm talkin' to you.

1116
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:47,000
Is our young man
hungry today?

1117
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:50,360
Can we interest him

01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:25,240
As James Brown would say,
we're headin' to the bridge,
hey!

1281
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:34,560
(BARKS)
Good-bye, Delilah.

1282
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:36,560
I'm sorry.

1283
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:02,160
Come on, you two.
Keep it moving.

1284
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:03,920
Pick it up a little, Sassy.

1285
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,800
Do you think he even knows
where the bridge is?

1286
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:10,480
He knows. He said
we'd be there by sun-up.

1287
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,880
If you can't find the bridge
from here,

1288
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:22,960
well, you're in more trouble
than I thought.

1289
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:25,920
(CHUCKLES) I guess we can
find it, Riley.

1290
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:28,520
So, this is it.

1291
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:30,560
No, really? (CHUCKLES)

1292
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:32,440
You mean, you're not gonna visit
the city every weekend?

1293
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:34,600
Oh, I've had enough city life,
thank you.

1294
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:36,960
Well, if you're ever
in the neighborhood, drop by,

1295
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:39,760
but do call first.
Good-bye, Riley.

1296
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:41,440
So long, Sassy.

1297
01:08:41,680 --> 01:08:44,080
You know, she's kinda fine
for a feline.

1298
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:45,760
Uh-huh, you know it!

1299
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:47,880
-Bye, Riley.
-Wait up, Sassy.

1300
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:49,360
Yo, house pet!

1301
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:53,960
I'll keep in mind
what you said about humans.

1302
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:55,840
Riley, you're all right.

1303
01:08:56,680 --> 01:08:59,560

leave Chance behind.
Home won't be the same.

-Exactly.
-Sassy,

1313
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:31,080
we can't cross the bridge
without him.

1314
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:34,640
Oh, you're right.
Drat, we were so close.

1315
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:37,440
Then it's settled.
We're going back.

-Oh, no!

Well, well,

Back off, Ashcan.
We don't wanna fight.

Don't wanna fight?

You're not so tough without
your buddy Riley around.

We're just trying to get home.
So I'll ask you again...

1322

Shadow, be careful.

1323
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:57,640
Back off, both of you.

1324

You ain't the one
I want, Gramps.

-ASHCAN: Go to it, Pete.

I'm on it, boss.

that one?

-Well, I can't speak for Sassy.

You know, you worry too much.

1381
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:34,880
I've been trailing you
ever since you left Riley's.

1382
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:37,280
I knew we could count
on you, Chance.

1383
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:40,880
So, my dynamic dog duo,
let's all go home.

Absolutely.

1385
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:45,000
Yeah, that's assuming
I still have a home.

1386
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:47,480
Don't be ridiculous.
You're home's with us.

1387
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:48,720
And with Jamie.

1388
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:50,960
He must be worried sick
about you.

1389
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:52,880
Or just plain sick of me.

1390
01:12:56,280 --> 01:12:58,400
It's Riley! He's back.

1391
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:03,120

look at you,

1392
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:05,120
sitting here like your tail
won't ever wag again.

1393
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:07,040
Riley, I feel terrible.

1394
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:09,200
How could I have said
those things to Chance?

1395
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:11,320
You did what you had to,
Delilah.

1396
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:12,400
It was for the best.

and he's not.

but that's just the way it is.

I'm really sorry.
Is everybody okay?

1442
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:09,600
Yeah, we're fine.
But what happened?

1443
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:12,080
There was this crazy dog
right in the road!

1444
01:16:12,160 --> 01:16:13,400
I tried to stop,
but these rigs

1445
01:16:13,480 --> 01:16:15,240
-just don't stop that fast.
-Chance!

-Chance!
-Honey,

1448
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:23,600
why don't you go talk
to the trucker?

-Chance.

Where's Chance?

1452

Where's Chance, Dad?
Where's my dog?

1453
01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:43,560
Jamie, the reason
the trucker...

1454
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:49,000
The reason he put on his brakes
so quickly was...

1455
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:54,440
there was a dog
in the middle of the road.

1456
01:16:55,160 --> 01:16:57,880
No. No!

01:16:58,240 --> 01:17:00,880

CHANCE: Oh!
What am I talking about?
Of course it's you!

1462

It's really you! I found you!
I found my boy!

It's so good to see you again.
I love you, Chance.

CHANCE: I can't believe...

1472
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:35,040
I thought
I'd never see you again!

I was mean to you.

It's okay.
You go ahead without me.

01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:55,840
Come on, buddy.

Hey, Dad, there's
something wrong with Chance.

1486
01:18:11,160 --> 01:18:13,680
I mean, he's sick or something.

01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:15,200
Well, he's tired, son.

1488
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:17,440
He'll be fine
when he gets all rested up.

You gotta take a little time.
You'll see, after a while

you're gonna forget
all about...

-Oh, Chance, I've missed you.

Delilah, how did you find me?

1511
01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:24,560
I followed my nose, Chance,

I'm so sorry.

as pretty as you.

It's all right.
I think Chance knows her.

1530

Oh, yeah, he knows her.

1531

stick around this time.
