00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,500
My reminiscence.

3
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,620
I always thought
that for such a lovely river...

4
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,620
...the name was mystifying:

5
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,460
Cape Fear.

6
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:54,500
When the only thing to fear
on those enchanted summer nights...

7
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:59,380
...was that the magic would end
and real life would come crashing in.

8
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:38,380
Okay, Cady, the moment
you've been waiting for.

9
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:05,620
Any people coming for you, Cady?

10
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:09,180
-What about your books?
-Already read them.

11
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,980
Hi. How are you?

12
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,180
-¿Cómo estás?
-Bien.

13
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,700
This ropa limpia?

14
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:47,540
No, that means "clean." These are dirty.

15
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:50,140
The idea is to resolve the tension.

16
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:54,780
I need to find a motif
that's about movement.

17
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:58,300
Not the most mind-blowing concept
for a travel agency...

18
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,340
...but what the hey?

19
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,900
-Like an arrow, maybe?
-Yeah, like an arrow.

20
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,380
Maybe.

21
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:10,220
But, see, then the other aspect
is stability...

22
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:13,220
...a company that you can trust.

23
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,580
So if you can balance those ideas...

24
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:19,060
...in a way that's pleasing to the eye
then you got a logo.

25
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:22,300
Okay: Movement, stability...

26
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,300
...and an arrow.

27
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:29,700
Okay, I'll think of something for that one.

28
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:33,220
Benjamin! Yes.

29
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,300
They switched babies on me
at the hospital, didn't they?

30
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,980
How'd you do in there?

31
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:41,860
I got the judge to postpone
the alimony hearing for another 21 days.

32
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,620
Great.

33
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:47,260
I've got till Monday to find out
which S and L and which municipality...

34
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:50,300
-...my son-in-law stashed all that money.
-Right.

35
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:53,420
-Anyway, my daughter and I thank you.
-You're welcome, Tom.

36
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:57,660
Here's Daddy!

37
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,500
Good-bye, Junior.

38
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,140
¡Adios!

39
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:14,660
Yes, that's very creative, Junior.

40
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,260
He liked me.

41
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:24,780
All this time, he actually liked me.

42
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:38,100
You can't go in. Your father's making
a television appearance for his campaign.

43
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,300
Dad, I've got to talk to you.

44
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:45,140
What the hell are you doing here?
I'm about to go on the air.

45
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:48,140
What is this smoke?

46
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,620
Excuse me.

47
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:59,980
Come on, let's move seats.

48
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:13,260
Okay, then I quit as your son.

49
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:18,180
Do you believe that annoying loser guy?

50
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:20,300
You should have just punched him out.

51
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:23,060
What? Just punched him out?
What do you mean?

52
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:26,620
You boxed. You could've
shoved him around, shut him up.

53
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,260
-I could take you.
-Careful.

54
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:31,420
-That's who I could take.
-You could've kicked him in the face.

55
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:32,900
Kicked him in the face?

56
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:36,140
You know how to fight dirty.
You do that for a living.

57
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,820
Real cute, Leigh.

58
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:41,180
-Let's sit outside.
-How much do I owe you?

59
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,820
-It's taken care of.
-Taken care of? Who?

60
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,500
There.

61
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:02,860
Girls, come on, let's sit inside.
Yeah, let's sit inside.

62
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,500
Mr. Perfect Form.

63
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,420
-Look.
-What?

64
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:36,100
You gotta snap your wrist
on the backhand.

65
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:38,780
Usually I like a little music
at this point, Sam.

66
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:41,140
Sam, I want to play in this lifetime.

67
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,580
All right.

68
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:45,900
-You gotta snap your wrist.
-Tag.

69
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:53,260
-We should stop doing this for a while.
-Doing what? We're not doing anything.

70
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,100
-No, I know that.
-Yet.

71
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:58,260
Okay. Fine. Maybe you're right.

72
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,780
Why? Does your wife mind?

73
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:04,260
My wife doesn't even know you exist,
which, most certainly, is for the best.

74
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,100
Why's that?

75
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:09,020
God, Lori, you know why you ask
that question?

76
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,220
-'Cause you've never been married.
-Why?

77
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:14,060
Is marriage synonymous with deception?

78
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:17,780
It's just that when two people...

79
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:21,460
...get married and live together
for a long time...

80
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:27,220
I like hanging out with you, so sue me.

81
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:31,300
You're funny, and you're cute,
and, I don't know...

82
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:35,260
We talk about the courts
and which judge is senile...

83
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,420
...which one wears a gun under his robe.

84
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:41,100
Oh, God. You know, Lori,
another time, another place...

85
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,620
...and who knows?

86
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:46,740
-Tomorrow?
-Yeah, it's a light docket.

87
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:50,220
No, I won two out of three.
Let's make it best out of five.

88
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:55,460
All right, that's good, actually,
because today I let you win.

89
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:58,260
-Sure you did.
-See ya.

90
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,740
Free as a bird. You go wherever you want
with whomever.

91
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,620
That much freedom
could get a fellow in trouble.

92
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:15,260
-I'd like my keys.
-Could it be you don't remember me?

93
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:18,140
I remember you.
You were at the movies the other night.

94
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:20,260
I'm disappointed. I'm hurt.

95
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:22,260
I would like my keys.

96
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,700
Max Cady.

97
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,340
You look the same.

98
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,380
Maybe 15 pounds heavier.

99
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:34,260
But they say the average man
gains a pound a year till he's about...

100
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,740
Come on.

101
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,060
Gains a pound a year till he's about 60.

102
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:43,700
Me? I dropped a pound every year
in my sentence.

103
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:48,180
-Atlanta, '77.
-You got it. July.

104
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:52,060
Fourteen years since I held a set of keys.

105
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,900
Well, you look good, healthy.

106
00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:00,300
Thank you. It's a struggle
to stay healthy in the joint.

107
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:03,140
But you wouldn't know about that,
would you?

108
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:06,780
They would stick you with
the white trash. They don't work all day.

109
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,140
In fact...

110
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:11,540
...this little old cigar is my only vice...

111
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:15,340
...'cause I needed a vice in the joint
to remind me I was human.

112
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,020
What brings you to New Essex?

113
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,020
Oh, the climate.

114
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,740
Boy, the South.

115
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:27,460
I'm thinking of settling down here
in New Essex, Counsellor.

116
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,020
Have you been following me?

117
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:32,740
It's a small town.
We're gonna run into each other.

118
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:35,780
-Well, take care, Mr. Cady.
-You, too.

119
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:42,140
-You're gonna learn about loss.
-What?

120
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:54,220
Dad, could you...

121
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,580
I'm sorry, Dani.

122
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,820
-What're you working on?
-It's English.

123
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:03,260
We're supposed to read
Look Homeward, Angel...

124
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:05,620
...which is a kind of reminiscence...

125
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:08,820
...and we have to attempt something
in the same style.

126
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:12,220
What's it about, your reminiscence?

127
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:15,420
The houseboat.

128
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,340
It's not even July 3 yet.

129
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:29,020
We ought to take two weeks
and go to Wilmington...

130
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:31,340
...like the old times, dock the houseboat.

131
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:34,300
I wanted to in early June.
You said you didn't have time.

132
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:37,020
-I probably don't.
-Yeah, now I don't, either.

133
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:39,540
Besides, Dani's got summer school
till Labor Day.

134
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:43,500
Is it really that critical
that she can't miss two damn weeks?

135
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:46,140
You know,
the alternative was to expel her.

136
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:50,900
Maybe this Drama teacher from the college
will get her excited about something.

137
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,420
Yeah, about him, probably.

138
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:57,380
Why'd they have to make such a stink,
like she was on heroin, or something?

139
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,740
I mean, what's marijuana?

140
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:02,580
You and I smoked a little dope in our time.

141
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:06,020
In some cultures,
it's considered almost a sacrament.

142
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:08,100
I realize in ours it's forbidden.

143
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:13,180
Right up there with incest
and necrophilia and bestiality.

144
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,820
Honey.

145
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:18,260
-Worship of idols, cannibalism.
-Do that again.

146
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:21,620
-What?
-Do that again.

147
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,820
-Sam, somebody's out there!
-What?

148
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,140
Leave the light off. Leave it off.

149
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:25,380
I saw him when the fireworks went off.

150
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,220
What?

151
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:30,460
-I think I talked to him this afternoon.
-You know him?

152
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:33,340
I want you the hell off my property!

153
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:47,980
He's gone.

154
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:57,060
He said,
"I'm gonna make you think about loss."

155
00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:00,740
Or, "I'm gonna make you learn about loss."
Something like that.

156
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:03,380
That's very poetic.

157
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:06,500
-Who is he? Where did he come from?
-He's from...

158
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:09,900
Come on, Leigh, get the dog off.
Ben, get down.

159
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:14,860
He doesn't mind me at all.
It's your dog. Come on.

160
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,060
No, he shouldn't be up on the table.

161
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:19,980
-You'll have dog hairs in the tea.
-Get down.

162
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:21,580
Where's he from?

163
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:24,140
He's from the hills, Pentecostal crackers.

164
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,380
What was he in prison for?

165
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:32,380
-I think it was battery.
-You think it was battery?

166
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:37,060
-Who did he batter? A man? A woman?
-I don't know.

167
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:40,940
It was fourteen years ago.
You know, it's kind of...

168
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:43,300
I really don't remember.

169
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:46,940
What does he want with you?

170
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:49,740
He's just trying to bug us,
just messing around.

171
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:52,660
He's an ex-con, so he's just...

172
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:57,300
You know, he's probably upset
at the lawyer.

173
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:00,500
-Yeah, your clientele.
-Yeah.

174
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,460
-'Bye, Dad.
-'Bye, Dani.

175
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:08,380
-You look tired.
-Thanks. I needed that.

176
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:12,420
I'd rather Dani didn't wander out alone...

177
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,180
...on her walks in the woods...

178
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:17,380
...till I've started a few things,
maybe even talk to the boss.

179
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,620
-What if she takes Benjamin with her?
-Big Ben, our guard dog?

180
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,660
What's he gonna do, lick him to death?

181
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:26,020
-Just tell her.
-What? I hardly know anything about him.

182
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:29,100
I don't mean his biography.
Just there's some creep around.

183
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,900
If you see him again,
call the cops and then call me.

184
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:34,060
What about a weapon?

185
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:37,660
In case things get exciting around here.

186
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:40,660
Would you feel more secure
with a loaded gun in the house?

187
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:43,020
We'd end up using it on each other.

188
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:46,940
Or Dani would. He won't do anything.
He just got out of prison.

189
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:49,460
He doesn't want to go right back.

190
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,660
Call Lee Heller.

191
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:57,820
Lee is a colorful character but he's still
the best criminal lawyer in the state.

192
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,340
-Good.
-Get me Lee Heller.

193
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:03,780
-Sam, you defended this guy, right?
-Right.

194
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:06,020
What makes you think
he wants to harm you?

195
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,980
Yesterday I was getting in my car.

196
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,860
The guy comes up.
We have a conversation.

197
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:14,220
He says to me,
"You're gonna learn about loss."

198
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:18,660
That'd hardly qualify
under the terrorist threat statutes.

199
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:21,460
Tom, for Christ's sake, the guy's an ex-con.

200
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:24,540
You know as well as I do what that means.

201
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:27,300
Last night, there he was, behind our house.

202
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:30,620
-Attempted B and E.
-No, not exactly.

203
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:34,380
He was sitting on a wall
that bounds our property.

204
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:37,060
That's not even trespassing, Sam.

205
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:40,420
Come on. What can I say?
Get a restraining order.

206
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:43,540
I filed one this morning.
The hearing's in ten days.

207
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:47,220
Good. Anything I can do.

208
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,900
Tom, fourteen years ago...

209
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:54,420
...in this case I had a report on the victim.

210
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,420
-It was a rape case.
-That's right.

211
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,740
Rape and aggravated sexual battery.

212
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:01,300
Anyway, I had a report on this victim...

213
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:04,220
...and it came back
that she was promiscuous.

214
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,220
And...

215
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,940
...I buried it.

216
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:16,460
-Anybody else know about this?
-No, I buried it.

217
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:19,860
I didn't show it to the client
or the prosecution.

218
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:22,820
But if you had seen
what this guy had done to this girl...

219
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:25,820
"In every criminal prosecution,
the accused shall have...

220
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:28,380
"...the Assistance of Counsel
for his defense."

221
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,100
I know the Sixth Amendment.
I believe in it.

222
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:33,500
That's why I left
the Public Defender's Office.

223
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:36,100
There was no way to serve the law
in that capacity.

224
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:38,660
Some folks don't have the right
to the best defense?

225
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:40,820
Of course they deserve the best defense!

226
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,620
But if you had seen what he did
to this girl...

227
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:46,620
-Buried the report.
-lf it was your own daughter.

228
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:49,740
-Yeah, I mean...
-Buried the report.

229
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:51,860
Jesus, Sam.

230
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,820
Oh, God.

231
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:03,100
But I don't see how he could know that.
He was illiterate.

232
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:06,460
I had to read everything to him:
the probable cause affidavit...

233
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,700
...the arrest reports, everything.

234
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,860
There's no way he could know that.

235
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,420
Hey, Dani...

236
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:28,260
...it's so quiet out here,
and the light's so perfect...

237
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:31,340
...why don't you get your book
and come out here and read?

238
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:33,020
Why?

239
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,540
I told you why.

240
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:39,860
Is it because he's like a flasher
or just a peeper?

241
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:42,380
What do you know about that? A flasher?

242
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:45,460
You don't think I've been flashed before?

243
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:49,380
I didn't mean to insult you.
I'm sure you've been flashed.

244
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:52,540
If you want to come out, come on out.
If you don't, go on.

245
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,540
Do whatever you want.

246
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:57,540
But don't go outside.

247
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:05,340
'Afternoon, Counselor.

248
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,820
What do you want, Mr. Cady?

249
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,540
They're great at that age, ain't they?

250
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:25,500
All those discoveries ahead of them.
You're lucky.

251
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:29,100
My own daughter,
she don't even know me.

252
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:32,220
After I went inside,
her mama told her I was dead...

253
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,580
...which, in a way, I was.

254
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:38,940
Mr. Cady, I realize that you suffered.

255
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:43,180
I understand your problem,
but, I mean, why me?

256
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:46,660
I was your lawyer. I defended you.

257
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:49,700
Why not badger the D.A. or the judge?

258
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:52,700
-"Badger."
-Why not them?

259
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:59,180
Best I remember,
they was just doing right by their jobs.

260
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:02,340
I didn't do my job? Is that right?

261
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:05,460
I pleaded you out
to a lesser occluded offense.

262
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:07,820
You could've gotten rape
instead of battery.

263
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:11,620
I'd have been up for parole in seven years
according to Georgia penal code.

264
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:15,140
Rape is a capital offense.
You could've gotten life, death.

265
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:17,860
You could be sitting
on death row right now.

266
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:22,780
I learned to read during my stretch.

267
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:26,740
First, Spot Goes To The Farm...

268
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:30,420
...then Runaway Bunny,
then law books, mostly.

269
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:36,260
Did you know, after I discharged you,
I acted as my own attorney?

270
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:38,740
Applied several times for an appeal.

271
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,740
No, I didn't know that.

272
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,660
So, here we are...

273
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:49,740
...two lawyers, for all practical purposes,
talking shop.

274
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:51,900
How much do you want, Mr. Cady?

275
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:56,700
-How much do I want what?
-How much money do you want?

276
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:01,100
Money?
Counselor, do I look destitute to you?

277
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:04,060
I'm open to discussion,
within reasonable limits.

278
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,580
You ever been a woman?

279
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:11,260
-A what?
-A woman.

280
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:16,380
Some fat, hairy, ugly hillbilly's wet dream?

281
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:23,820
I realize that you suffered.
There's no question about that.

282
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:26,660
You don't know
what suffering is, Counselor.

283
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:29,620
Like it says in Galatians 3:

284
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:33,300
"Have ye suffered so many things in vain?"

285
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:40,500
I learned from the get-go in the joint
to get in touch with my feminine side.

286
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:50,780
I'm open to some sort of discussion
on compensation.

287
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:54,100
What shall be my compensation, sir...

288
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:57,420
...for being held down and sodomized
by four white guys...

289
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:59,740
...or four black guys?

290
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,980
Shall my compensation be the same?

291
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:06,460
What is the formula for compensation, sir?

292
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:08,820
How about $10,000 in cash?

293
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,140
Do I...

294
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:19,180
Let's just break that down.

295
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:22,780
That figure just came
to the top of my head.

296
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:27,700
For argument's sake,
let's say $20,000, $30,000.

297
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:30,380
I'll tell you what. Let's say $50,000.

298
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:33,100
$50,000 into fourteen years.

299
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:36,020
Fourteen years times 365 days...

300
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:39,060
...is about 5,000 days.

301
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:43,940
You divide that by $50,000,
and that's like $10 a day.

302
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:46,900
That's not even minimum wage.

303
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:50,780
To say nothing about the family
and respect that I lost.

304
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:54,900
I don't think you really understand
what we're talking about.

305
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,420
Fourteen years.

306
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,820
Whoops.

307
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:04,180
Gotta git.
I'm late for another appointment.

308
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:11,100
I got some good news.

309
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:13,100
I got the bank, the account number.

310
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:16,460
I'll call your son-in-law's lawyer,
tell him we're going to court.

311
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,660
Mr. Bowden, your wife's on line one.

312
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:20,900
Ask her to hold. I have to make a call.

313
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:24,020
-I wouldn't make that call. The way I'd...
-Mr. Bowden...

314
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:26,140
...she says it's urgent.

315
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,300
Yeah?

316
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:36,660
...these kind of horrible,
high-pitched howls.

317
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:39,300
They sounded like he was screaming...

318
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:42,260
...and then Dani came running in, and I...

319
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,500
...I called the vet.

320
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:49,660
Then it was so weird because...

321
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:55,500
...it was like he was winding down...

322
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:59,860
...just winding down like an old clock.

323
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:02,900
Then, all of a sudden, he just stopped.

324
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,780
He had this kind of...

325
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:11,500
...his eyes just wide open,
and this kind of...

326
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,620
...surprised look.

327
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:18,700
And then...

328
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,700
...then he died.

329
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:28,900
He just died, before the vet even got here.

330
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:33,260
What did the vet say?

331
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:36,100
-That he was poisoned.
-Poisoned?

332
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:38,260
What kind of poison?

333
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:43,340
-I don't know what kind of poison.
-Jesus! I told you not to let him out.

334
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:45,780
-I didn't let him out!
-Then how?

335
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,300
Stop!

336
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:53,020
I've got an English setter myself,
so I don't cotton to dog killers.

337
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:56,980
Trouble is, poisoning a dog is just a fine.

338
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:59,740
But if he's unemployed,
he has to have money...

339
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,620
...or we'll bust him for vagrancy.

340
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:04,460
We'll give him a full-body strip search.

341
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:08,380
Jerk a knot in his tail.

342
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,140
All right.

343
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:15,180
They got so many ways on the books
to lean on an undesirable.

344
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:18,540
He'll feel about as welcome
around here as a case of yellow fever.

345
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:21,700
-Hands against the wall.
-Spread them.

346
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,620
-That him?
-Face the wall.

347
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:27,460
One-way mirror, Mr. Bowden.
He doesn't know you're here.

348
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:29,780
Yeah, that's him.

349
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,780
Get the shirt off.

350
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:35,900
-Come on, hurry up.
-Just pass it over to him.

351
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:41,500
-Hand it to me.
-Knock off the shoes.

352
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:44,820
Hand them to the other officer.

353
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:49,060
Pass them to him. Come on.

354
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:52,460
Put the arms out.

355
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,980
Put your arms out straight.

356
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:58,820
Roll your palms.

357
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,060
Do what he says.

358
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:05,060
Turn around, slow.

359
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,740
I don't know whether
to look at him or read him.

360
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:22,420
Stand still.

361
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:27,420
One more step for you.
You know the routine.

362
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:31,380
Against the wall.

363
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:35,100
We searched his apartment.
Car registration and everything's in order.

364
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:38,700
There's no guns or any other weapons.
But we found these.

365
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,980
Cady's savings account.

366
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:45,500
$30,000?

367
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:48,060
Yeah, his mother died
while he was serving.

368
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:50,380
The farm got sold off.
He got the proceeds.

369
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:53,500
He's got money.
Where does that leave us?

370
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:56,580
At the very least, we nail him
for the dog. What happened?

371
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:59,500
You let the dog out. Cady abducted him.

372
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,860
We didn't let the dog out.

373
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:07,140
Cady came into your house?
That's illegal entry with intent.

374
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:10,300
But he didn't come in the house.

375
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:14,900
I'm not a cop.
I don't know exactly how he did it.

376
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:17,620
I just know that he did it somehow.

377
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,620
That's not good enough, Mr. Bowden.

378
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:21,940
You're a lawyer.
You damn well know that.

379
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:23,980
Get off the pants.

380
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:31,060
Sooner or later, he's gonna screw up.

381
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:34,220
The sheriff assured me
that they always do. He's an ex-con.

382
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:36,820
He's going to get the message
in no uncertain terms.

383
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,540
I'd still like to kill him.

384
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:05,380
How come you didn't join up with them?
You can tap.

385
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:07,340
You can tap dance.

386
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:11,540
I wanted to once, but I don't know...

387
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:24,020
-Son of a bitch.
-What?

388
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:32,060
-He's staring at you.
-What are you talking about?

389
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,580
What the hell are you doing?

390
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:41,300
Hot as a firecracker on the 4th of July.

391
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:46,420
-You're damn lucky to have her, boy.
-You son of a bitch.

392
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:48,420
Where did he go?

393
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:57,700
Watch my arm. It might be broke.

394
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:01,540
What's with you? You have no right
to be pushing me around like that.

395
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:05,060
I was just watching the parade.
I wasn't pranking on nobody.

396
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:07,780
What are you getting so upset about?

397
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:10,060
You're lucky I don't sue you.

398
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,780
All right.

399
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:15,780
-Settle down.
-I am settled down.

400
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,580
-What are you doing?
-It's nothing.

401
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:23,100
-Who was that?
-It's no one. Come on.

402
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:26,500
The fellow with the tie,
his wife took him away.

403
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:30,180
-I think he really hurt his arm.
-Mom!

404
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:36,460
-Strong drink you got there, mister.
-You said it.

405
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:40,180
Just put a little goldfish in it,
and you'll be fine.

406
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:43,820
You seem to be having a good time.

407
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:47,260
-I've been practicing.
-Practicing for what?

408
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:50,500
-How to fall on the floor?
-A life of debauchery.

409
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:51,860
Debauch, what?

410
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:54,660
Debauchery. It's a three-syllable word.

411
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:59,300
Making fun of me?
That's okay. No problem.

412
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:02,180
-I made you blush.
-Blush?

413
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:06,340
Yes. You're now the color
of your shirt, scarlet.

414
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:11,420
I had no business getting
stuck on a guy who was married.

415
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:14,980
-You certainly did not.
-I don't know what I was thinking.

416
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,180
God only knows.

417
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:19,700
Aren't I the bozo on this bus?

418
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:24,340
Oh, God. Lest you think that I slept
with this particular married guy...

419
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,140
That's your business. Not mine.

420
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:29,860
I don't want to make it sound like
I've been through a busload of them.

421
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:32,180
That's the way it sounded to me.

422
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:34,540
-He was the first.
-Oh, yeah.

423
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:37,340
-He was, I swear.
-Oh, yeah.

424
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:40,060
-Oh, boy.
-Tell it to the judge.

425
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:45,780
-Actually the rat stood me up today.
-Did he?

426
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,420
-Yes!
-What a shame.

427
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:49,340
I know.

428
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:51,940
So, now it's my turn. Where are you from?

429
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:53,340
Where am I from?

430
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:55,100
-You're gonna love this.
-Yes.

431
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:59,580
I'm from the Georgia State
Correctional Facility.

432
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:09,540
You think I'm joking? That's the truth.
I just got released from prison.

433
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:13,700
My god. This is the way
my day has been turning out.

434
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:17,500
Actually, it reminds me of a joke.

435
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:21,300
-Do you want to hear it?
-Tell me. Liven up the night.

436
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:25,660
An unmarried woman...
Wait a minute, that's not it.

437
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:29,020
-Come on, get the joke straight.
-Shut up. Let me do it.

438
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:31,180
An unmarried woman meets a guy...

439
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:33,980
...and he tells her he just got out of prison.

440
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,140
"What did you do?" she asks.

441
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:40,620
"I hacked my wife into 52 pieces
with a chain saw."

442
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:44,660
She says, "So, you're single?"

443
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:47,380
-That's even funnier.
-Thank you.

444
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,500
-Could I ask you something?
-What?

445
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:51,860
-What did you do?
-I knew you were going to ask.

446
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:56,580
-I hacked my wife into 52 pieces.
-I was afraid you'd say that.

447
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:59,380
I'm a very small person, so maybe...

448
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:02,260
Maybe I can hack you into 40 pieces.

449
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:10,100
-What did you do, really?
-No, really, but what did you do?

450
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:16,900
There was this protest march
on this nuclear power plant and...

451
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:19,060
...when they came to arrest us...

452
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:22,020
...this macho sheriff got rough
with the lady behind me.

453
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:25,900
I popped the bastard,
so they gave me a little time for it.

454
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:29,660
I'm drinking a sea breeze.
I hope you can afford them.

455
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:34,300
You have to stay sober. If you ain't
sober, you're taking your chances.

456
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:36,460
Because I'm just one hell of an animal.

457
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:38,500
Yeah? Do tell.

458
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:43,660
Get you on this side, doll. Let's do this.

459
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:45,740
Who is Loretta anyway?

460
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:48,460
That's the love of my life.
She's no longer with us.

461
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:52,380
-I thought I was the love of your life.
-Chopped her into 52 pieces.

462
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:59,860
He hurt you like this, that married guy?

463
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:03,260
-He hurt you like this?
-I told you, we never did anything.

464
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:06,700
-He hurt you like this?
-Oh, scandal.

465
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,900
He's a rough one.

466
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:11,100
How's this feel?

467
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:16,420
Oh, my God. Am I under arrest?

468
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:20,980
Not quite, darlin'.

469
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:26,180
Officer, I swear, it's all a mistake.

470
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:31,020
That married guy hurt you like this?

471
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:34,140
Because what he did to me
hurt a lot worse than this!

472
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:45,300
I've got you now, bitch!

473
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:58,460
Dani, when did this key stop working?

474
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:01,300
What? Oh, I don't know.

475
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:05,020
No wonder. A wire's missing.

476
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:10,380
A piano wire is missing. Was somebody
fooling around with the piano?

477
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:11,860
What?

478
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,660
-Yeah?
-Mr. Bowden.

479
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:19,380
-I think we might have a little break.
-Good.

480
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:23,260
I can be there in a half hour.
All right, fine. Thank you.

481
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:26,460
-Who was that?
-Cady raped another girl.

482
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:30,380
Rape? You said it was battery.

483
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:33,140
The case was wobbly. I got it reduced.

484
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:35,660
I remember those days, old slippery Sam.

485
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:38,740
I'm sorry.
I just didn't want to alarm you or Dani.

486
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:41,780
-Why? How old was that girl?
-16.

487
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,820
16, what?

488
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:52,460
My birthday is coming up.

489
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:54,580
Neighbors heard screams and called us.

490
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:57,420
When the perp drove off,
somebody made his plate.

491
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:59,460
-Max Cady.
-Great.

492
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:02,820
We got one little problem.
The girl is scared.

493
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:05,620
She's claiming she fell down some stairs.

494
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:17,460
Don't look at me.

495
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:21,820
Oh, my God.

496
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:24,420
You two know each other?

497
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:30,860
Yeah, we work together.

498
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:33,500
I'll be outside.

499
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:39,580
I'm so stupid.

500
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:47,780
You stood me up at the club the other day.

501
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,900
Then you didn't call.

502
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:54,860
By last night...

503
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:57,860
...I was feeling pretty reckless.

504
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:01,980
I thought about what you said, you know...

505
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:06,340
...that your wife didn't know I existed.

506
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,700
And I felt like...

507
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:12,220
...I was going to show you.

508
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:17,100
I guess I showed you, all right, didn't I?

509
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:21,100
I guess I really showed you.

510
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:28,820
Listen to me, okay?

511
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:32,020
Now, look, this guy Cady...

512
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:34,700
...he's done this kind of thing before.

513
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:38,740
Now, he's going to do this
over and over again...

514
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:42,140
...unless you testify
and we take him to court...

515
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:43,660
No.

516
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:46,180
And press charges and testify.

517
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:52,700
I know how it works. I see it every day.

518
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:56,220
Only this time, I'm on the other side.

519
00:38:57,020 --> 00:39:00,500
I don't want to explain why I was in a bar...

520
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:04,140
...and how much I had to drink
and what I was wearing.

521
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:06,580
Not by the people I work with.

522
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:11,740
Not by the guys that I see
cross-examine other people on the stand.

523
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:15,820
Just crucify them.
They just laugh about it later.

524
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:19,780
They'll even ask about you.

525
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:23,980
Listen to me. I don't care about that.

526
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:26,820
Well, I care about that.

527
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:29,660
I'm sure you do, too.

528
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:36,500
I'm terribly sorry. I'm just terribly sorry.

529
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:45,020
If this is something personal
between you, the girl and Cady...

530
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:46,180
Personal?

531
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:50,620
All right, come on, Lieutenant.
What are you implying?

532
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:54,060
Only that there are some things
that are better handled quietly.

533
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:55,540
Not by the police.

534
00:39:56,700 --> 00:40:00,020
This Cady is planning to rape my wife,
but it's not your problem?

535
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:02,500
I can't bust someone for planning a rape.

536
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:05,260
You're a lawyer.
You know that damn well.

537
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:07,260
-Thanks.
-The way I'd handle it...

538
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:09,780
What, file a restraining order?
I already did.

539
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:11,860
Just think of Cady as a tiger.

540
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:15,620
The trick is to get him out of the brush.
How do we do that?

541
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:18,700
You stake out a couple of your goats
and hide in a tree.

542
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:20,500
What are you suggesting?

543
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:24,100
That I use my family as bait?
And then what?

544
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:27,780
Hope that this psychopath
attacks my wife and child?

545
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:31,220
-Then what? Blow his head off?
-I'm a law officer.

546
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:35,740
It would be unethical of me to advise a
citizen to take the law into his own hands.

547
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:39,900
-I suppose you must've misunderstood me.
-I guess I must've.

548
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:42,980
Well, pardon me all over the place.

549
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:11,340
And he's been harassing my family.

550
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:15,460
Cleverly, so that the law can't touch him.

551
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:18,700
I believe he's able to slip
in and out of the house undetected.

552
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:20,660
Although, is he out? I can't tell.

553
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:23,460
He's either out or in. I'm not sure.

554
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:24,980
I can't see through walls.

555
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:28,660
I'm not asking you to see through walls.
That's fine.

556
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:32,980
Why can't anybody do anything for me?
What good are cops and laws...

557
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:36,580
Sam, calm down.
Let me explain something to you.

558
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:39,620
The system is set up to handle
generalized problems...

559
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:41,900
...like burglary and robbery.

560
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:45,740
But if some lone creep targets you
for some obscure reason...

561
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:49,020
...the system is slow and skeptical.
Pathetic even.

562
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:52,980
What's your connection with this fellow?

563
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:57,700
-I was his lawyer, his public defender.
-But you shafted him somehow, right?

564
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:02,380
-At least that's the way he perceives it.
-I don't care what you did.

565
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:05,420
-What did he do?
-He raped a 16-year-old girl.

566
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:09,100
Do you have a daughter around 16?

567
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:10,780
She's 15.

568
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:13,060
Here's the deal.

569
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:16,700
I'll do a background check,
follow him and write up a risk assessment.

570
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:19,860
-Great. Now, the cops...
-I can find him.

571
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:23,660
-His name's Max Cady.
-Just take it easy. Stay calm.

572
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:27,580
Dani, you can just relax because...

573
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:31,780
...your daddy has a private investigator
on the payroll.

574
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,660
Isn't that right?

575
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:37,420
What's your feeling about him?
What, Sam Spade?

576
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:40,860
Mickey Spillane? Peter Gunn?

577
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:43,620
Dirty Harry? Perry Mason?

578
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:46,660
No. Perry Mason was a lawyer.

579
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:49,900
The minute I walked in
this guy's office, I felt relaxed.

580
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:51,900
This guy is totally in charge.

581
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:54,340
Kersek deals with these types for a living.

582
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:56,820
He looked like he was going to enjoy...

583
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:00,620
-Yes?
-Yeah, it's me.

584
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:05,820
After you left, I had this conversation
with a C.O. at Statesboro prison.

585
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:08,580
Seems our man Cady had
a job in the kitchen.

586
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:12,140
There was this other inmate
working there with him, obstinate S.O.B.

587
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:16,260
He hated Cady's cigar smoke
and was always moaning about it.

588
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:19,900
One day, they found him
with his neck broke and his tongue bit off.

589
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:20,780
Jesus.

590
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:21,900
Yeah.

591
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:28,740
They couldn't place Cady
at the scene of the accident...

592
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:30,380
...if you want to call it that...

593
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:32,220
...at least not out loud.

594
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:36,220
But the parole board kept him in
for another seven years.

595
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:39,900
The subject is on the move.
Get a good night's sleep.

596
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:42,140
-Who was that?
-Our private eye.

597
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:44,260
I thought we were relaxed now.

598
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:48,140
New Essex County Hospital.

599
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:51,140
Yes, room 5036, please.

600
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:53,300
-One minute, please.
-All right.

601
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:56,940
-Hello?
-Hi, Lori, it's me.

602
00:43:57,020 --> 00:44:00,300
I just feel God-awful
you got dragged into this thing.

603
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:01,700
It's not your fault.

604
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:06,820
If I had any idea that Cady would hurt you
to get at me, I would have warned you.

605
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:09,580
Yeah, I know. I'm glad you called.

606
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:11,620
Yeah, well.

607
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:15,300
-I'm so sorry about this.
-I feel the same way.

608
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:20,740
Are you really determined
about moving back to Connecticut?

609
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:22,780
I've thought about it a lot.

610
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:25,660
I just think it's probably the best thing.

611
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:29,020
I thought that maybe
I could go back to school.

612
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:31,660
I'm really going to miss you.

613
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:33,780
Right. Excuse me.

614
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:36,260
-That sounds real good.
-Yeah.

615
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:40,340
-That'll work out fine. I'll get back to you.
-All right, 'bye.

616
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:47,940
Well, I just don't know what I hate more:

617
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:53,020
That insipid tone
or your stupid, sophomoric infidelities.

618
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:55,180
Who was that?

619
00:44:56,540 --> 00:44:58,980
-The girl that got beat up?
-Yes, it was.

620
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:02,580
I already told you.
She's a clerk at the county courthouse.

621
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:05,980
And what? You're fucking her?

622
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:10,820
Interesting choice, Sam.
Calling from our bedroom phone.

623
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:14,820
Why is it that whenever I have
a private phone conversation...

624
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:17,500
...you assume that I'm fucking someone?

625
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:21,420
That's why that psychopath
chose her, right?

626
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:25,580
Yes, that's why he chose her.
But I'm not fucking her in any way.

627
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:31,020
Well, you sleazy son of a bitch!

628
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:35,220
Stop it!

629
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:37,700
Dani is right downstairs.

630
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:43,340
-Honey, there's nothing the matter.
-Yeah, I can see, Dad.

631
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:47,860
I thought you promised
to leave all that shit behind in Atlanta.

632
00:45:56,620 --> 00:46:00,260
The humiliation we went through
confessing our dirty little secrets...

633
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:02,420
...in those sessions with Dr. Hackett.

634
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:05,620
-We talked that one incident to death.
-Why did you bother?

635
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:08,980
-Because you asked me to go.
-I mean, why did you bother?

636
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:14,580
Why did you bother with you and me?
With the marriage?

637
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:18,060
Uprooting me and Dani? Moving?

638
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:22,020
Because that's what we decided to do!
You said you wanted to get out.

639
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:25,740
-What is it I don't get?
-You don't get it.

640
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:30,780
Nadine?

641
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:33,260
It's Dani.

642
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:35,900
Nothing.

643
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:39,620
I'm just losing my mind here.

644
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:44,540
You know, had the balls to walk out,
if that's what you wanted.

645
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:47,580
Like I was going to split,
with you acting the way you act.

646
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:50,300
Acting? You did some acting.

647
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:52,180
I don't remember acting.

648
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:55,300
You don't remember?
Let me refresh your memory.

649
00:46:55,420 --> 00:46:59,620
Remember not working for three months?
Not fixing any meals?

650
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:01,700
I'm not on fucking trial here!

651
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:06,460
Do you remember crying every morning
afternoon, evening? Remember that?

652
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:11,340
I scared you, huh?

653
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:14,540
What did you think, Sam?

654
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:18,180
You thought maybe
I was going to kill myself?

655
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:20,380
-Over you?
-Who else?

656
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:22,060
You pompous ass.

657
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:24,980
You wouldn't leave the bedroom!

658
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:29,660
-I wish you could say the same.
-This what Dr. Hackett talked about.

659
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:31,340
Digging up the past.

660
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:37,420
The relevant issue is whether
I've been messing around in New Essex.

661
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:39,060
And I have not been.

662
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:42,740
As far as this girl goes, she's just a kid.

663
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:44,140
That shouldn't stop you.

664
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:48,180
She's a baby. You gravitate
to people in the same profession as you.

665
00:47:48,380 --> 00:47:49,780
You gravitate to women.

666
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:53,460
Come on, I'm a lawyer, she's a clerk.
She looks up to me.

667
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:56,300
She's just infatuated. I can't help that.

668
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:03,580
Look, Leigh, I'm scared.

669
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:06,540
This whole thing has...

670
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:12,580
I keep feeling that there
is some animal out there stalking us.

671
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:15,700
I think he wants to hurt us
in the worst way...

672
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:19,420
...and that's got me frightened to death.

673
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:26,620
-You really are scared, aren't you?
-Yeah.

674
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:28,820
Somebody finally got to you.

675
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:32,180
Look, I think...

676
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:37,300
...he beat and raped her because he knew
that she wouldn't testify...

677
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:40,500
...that she wouldn't press charges...

678
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:42,780
...because she knows the system.

679
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:44,740
I mean, she works in it.

680
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:46,980
She knows that she'd be on trial.

681
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:52,500
Then, because she wouldn't testify,
you would assume that...

682
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:55,260
...there was something
going on between us...

683
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:58,220
...and it would cause a rift.

684
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:03,700
That we'd be much more vulnerable to him.

685
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:14,100
I'm glad we talked about this,
because we can work together.

686
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:17,940
We can beat that son of a bitch,
the two of us, working as a team.

687
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:23,180
Jesus Christ.

688
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:27,780
Yeah, this is great. This is something else.

689
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:31,020
Oh, shit!

690
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:44,580
-Here you go.
-I'm sorry, I haven't ordered yet.

691
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:47,660
That fellow over there
sent this over, paid for and all.

692
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:48,740
Who?

693
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:52,020
-Which one?
-That guy who is just leaving.

694
00:49:56,060 --> 00:49:57,140
Excuse me.

695
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:00,380
Cady, come here.

696
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:02,140
Wait up a second.

697
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:05,700
I've been in a real bad mood lately.
Shame, ain't it?

698
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:08,660
You know what you can do
to brighten my mood?

699
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:10,740
-No.
-Get the hell out of here.

700
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:14,220
I don't mean this town,
I mean the whole state.

701
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:18,420
I don't want to see you or hear you
and I don't want to smell you. Leave.

702
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:20,140
Are you my friend?

703
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:21,940
No, I'm not your friend.

704
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:26,620
I thought maybe you were because I like to
plan my comings and goings with friends.

705
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:30,060
But if you're not my friend,
I'd call that presumptuous.

706
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:34,020
In fact, I'd call it downright rude,
because I ain't your porch-baby, buddy.

707
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:39,060
Gee golly gosh. I'm sorry I offended you,
you white trash piece of shit.

708
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:41,820
I got the all-over fidgets on that one.

709
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:44,900
You've really shaken me up.
I'm shivering all over.

710
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:50,020
It's not necessary to lay
a foul tongue on me, my friend.

711
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:53,500
I could get upset.
Things could get out of hand.

712
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:56,420
Then, in self-defense,
I could do something to you...

713
00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:58,500
...that you would not like, right here.

714
00:50:58,620 --> 00:51:02,260
-Anytime you feel squirrelly, you just jump.
-You threatening me?

715
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:06,420
You catch on fast.

716
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:09,980
I'm well within my rights
to be here and you know it.

717
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:14,180
-lf I stay here, what you going to do?
-I don't give a rat's ass about your rights.

718
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:16,620
Watch your step,
you know what I'm talking about.

719
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:19,820
You going to arrest me?
You a cop? Or were you a cop?

720
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:22,340
Were you not good enough
to remain on the force?

721
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:24,700
That's the feeling I'm getting here.

722
00:51:27,220 --> 00:51:29,300
Hope you enjoyed your breakfast.

723
00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:39,420
Ma'am, this belong to you?

724
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:41,740
-Can I help you?
-I just found it.

725
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:44,300
Thought you might need it back.

726
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:48,460
Not to frighten you, but if a dogcatcher
comes across a dog without a license...

727
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:52,220
...he's liable to think he's a stray
and do God knows what to it.

728
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:54,300
You know...

729
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:56,940
...our dog is...

730
00:51:57,700 --> 00:51:59,860
-He passed away.
-What a shame.

731
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:02,900
Man's best friend and all. Woman's too.

732
00:52:04,140 --> 00:52:06,740
Even without closing my eyes,
I can picture him...

733
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:10,540
...big, friendly, shaggy,
asleep at your feet...

734
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:15,980
...keeping you company while you're trying
to finish up those pesky little sketches.

735
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:21,340
You're Max Cady, aren't you?

736
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:27,140
You better get the hell out of here
before I call the police.

737
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:28,740
I'm not doing nothing.

738
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:31,780
Just giving back your dog collar.
I'm not on your property.

739
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:34,100
What'd you come out here for,
to look around?

740
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:36,540
Go ahead, Mr. Cady, take a good look.

741
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:38,100
Nice house.

742
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:41,260
It is a nice house.
You satisfied now you've seen it?

743
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:44,460
Or is there more?

744
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:47,460
Is that it?

745
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:49,980
There is going to be more, isn't there?

746
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:52,380
You won't stop until you're happy.

747
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:56,180
How can I be happy
when you're not happy?

748
00:52:57,380 --> 00:52:59,300
You don't know anything about me.

749
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:02,060
-I know what I see, ma'am.
-Yeah?

750
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:05,620
I wanted to know what you looked like.

751
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:09,220
I've been waiting to see your face,
but now that I see you...

752
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:12,580
...you are just repulsive.

753
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:14,540
-I understand.
-Yeah.

754
00:53:14,620 --> 00:53:18,580
I'm not your type.
All that prison time made me coarse.

755
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:21,260
Guess I'm covered in too many tattoos?

756
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:26,740
But there's not a whole lot
to do in prison but desecrate your flesh.

757
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:29,620
It didn't have to be that way
for either of us...

758
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:32,380
...if your husband hadn't betrayed us both.

759
00:53:33,020 --> 00:53:35,260
Who knows?
We might have been different people.

760
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:38,060
We might have been happy, Leigh.

761
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:41,380
-Mom, someone's on the phone!
-Dani!

762
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:43,420
Don't come out here!

763
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:56,140
Sam.

764
00:53:57,260 --> 00:53:59,180
I thought I'd catch you here.

765
00:54:00,860 --> 00:54:03,020
-That little smart aleck made me.
-He what?

766
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:05,820
It wasn't my fault.
He was looking to be covered.

767
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:08,540
There is a lot of cutsie-cutsie
in that little prick.

768
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:10,860
-I told you.
-You know where he was today?

769
00:54:10,940 --> 00:54:13,660
At the public library reading
Thus Spake Zarathustra...

770
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:16,380
...by Friedrich Nietzsche,
the German philosopher.

771
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:19,020
-He said that God is dead.
-God is dead. Right.

772
00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:22,660
We can keep going this way,
but it's going to get expensive.

773
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:27,660
I'm not so concerned about days.
Stay on him a few more nights.

774
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:30,420
Do you really want
to resolve this situation?

775
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:33,780
-Yes, I'd love to resolve it.
-Then I got a suggestion.

776
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:38,900
There are men that can be hired, by me,
to do a little hospital job on Cady.

777
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:44,740
What are we talking about here?

778
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:47,220
Two pieces of pipe and a bicycle chain.

779
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:51,580
He won't be so scary after that.

780
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:53,860
I'm a lawyer. Are we agreed on that?

781
00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:57,620
Maybe 2,000 years ago,
we'd have stoned him to death.

782
00:54:57,740 --> 00:55:01,540
I can't operate outside the law.
The law is my business.

783
00:55:06,460 --> 00:55:10,860
-I'm home! Where is everybody?
-In here.

784
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:15,100
'Evening, ladies. Oh, chicken.

785
00:55:17,140 --> 00:55:19,220
How is everything? Is everything okay?

786
00:55:19,340 --> 00:55:21,100
-Yeah.
-Good.

787
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:27,820
He was here today.

788
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:38,100
-Hello?
-Hello, Danielle?

789
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:40,900
-Is this Miss Danielle Bowden?
-Yeah.

790
00:55:41,340 --> 00:55:43,340
This is your new teacher calling.

791
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:45,940
-From English or Drama?
-Drama.

792
00:55:46,780 --> 00:55:48,900
-So how you doing?
-Fine.

793
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:53,020
I'm just going down the list,
greeting my summer students.

794
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:55,020
You sound kind of down.

795
00:55:57,700 --> 00:56:00,940
There's just been stuff
going on around here, that's all.

796
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:03,580
-Anything I can do?
-I doubt it.

797
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:06,860
Shit happens, you know,
like the t-shirt says.

798
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:07,980
Yeah.

799
00:56:09,260 --> 00:56:13,340
You know, all that negativity,
you can use that.

800
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:16,500
What do you mean?

801
00:56:16,860 --> 00:56:20,420
I'm the kind of teacher that takes
a very personal interest in his kids.

802
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:24,620
Don't mind me. Everything you're
going through, it's okay, go with it.

803
00:56:24,740 --> 00:56:27,340
The awkwardness you feel,
walking down the street...

804
00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:30,500
...and some leering fool is
making fun of your sexuality...

805
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:34,740
...the turmoil you feel, extra bad when
that time of the month comes around...

806
00:56:34,820 --> 00:56:37,100
...the anger you feel
that your mom and dad...

807
00:56:37,180 --> 00:56:40,380
...won't let you grow up
and be yourself, be a woman.

808
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:45,260
Don't suppress or deny it.
Use it in your life and work.

809
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:49,020
Okay. I mean...

810
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:53,540
I'll have to think about all that.

811
00:56:54,340 --> 00:56:58,460
Class is tomorrow in Room 110, right?

812
00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:01,460
No, it's been changed to the theater.

813
00:57:01,580 --> 00:57:04,780
-What better place for Drama, right?
-Yeah.

814
00:57:06,780 --> 00:57:11,860
And remember, Danielle, you can use
all those fears to draw upon and learn.

815
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:14,660
You know this little tune?

816
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:18,940
"If you want a do right

817
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:20,580
"All days

818
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:23,540
"woman

819
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:27,420
"You've gotta be a

820
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:29,820
"do right

821
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:33,740
"All night man"

822
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:41,420
You can trust in me,
because I'm a do right man, okay?

823
00:57:43,820 --> 00:57:45,180
Okay, 'night now.

824
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:48,300
Okay. Good night.

825
00:57:52,740 --> 00:57:55,100
Honey, I think maybe I should walk you in.

826
00:57:55,220 --> 00:57:58,620
No, it's okay, Mom.
There are a lot of people here.

827
00:57:58,740 --> 00:58:00,860
I'll be right here at 4:00 to pick you up.

828
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:02,980
-Okay.
-'Bye.

829
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:07,860
I didn't think summer sessions
would be so crowded.

830
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:11,740
They're just having a big meeting
about next fall's chorus program.

831
00:58:12,140 --> 00:58:15,580
-I have to go downstairs for Drama.
-Okay, 'bye.

832
00:59:01,060 --> 00:59:02,500
Hello.

833
00:59:06,980 --> 00:59:08,460
Nadine?

834
00:59:21,940 --> 00:59:25,580
I'm here for the Drama class.

835
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:35,980
Am I busted?

836
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:38,300
-No.
-I hope not.

837
00:59:38,780 --> 00:59:41,340
You can't smoke grass in school.

838
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:43,500
Privilege of the profession.

839
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:47,060
Eases inhibitions.
You down here for Drama?

840
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:48,420
Yeah.

841
00:59:48,780 --> 00:59:50,940
Are you the Drama teacher?

842
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:53,380
And you're, let me guess.

843
00:59:56,460 --> 00:59:57,900
Cecile James?

844
00:59:58,020 --> 01:00:01,860
No, I'm Danielle Bowden.

845
01:00:02,020 --> 01:00:04,420
Danielle. Oh, we spoke last night.

846
01:00:04,620 --> 01:00:06,100
Yeah.

847
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:08,780
Oh, I'm sorry. How rude.

848
01:00:10,060 --> 01:00:11,380
It's okay.

849
01:00:17,020 --> 01:00:19,220
"I think we're alone now"

850
01:00:23,540 --> 01:00:24,740
Okay.

851
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:39,100
Thanks. Here.

852
01:00:39,580 --> 01:00:41,420
I'm going to give this to you.

853
01:00:46,020 --> 01:00:48,180
Little trick I learned. Take it.

854
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:54,500
You know when we spoke
on the phone last night?

855
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:58,340
You really made sense to me.

856
01:01:00,940 --> 01:01:02,620
I thought a lot.

857
01:01:02,740 --> 01:01:05,460
Those are human truths.
That's what it's all about.

858
01:01:05,580 --> 01:01:07,700
And that's what we deal with here.

859
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:10,500
See the book you have, Thomas Wolfe?

860
01:01:11,020 --> 01:01:13,820
It's all about self-discovery,
the inner voyage.

861
01:01:15,740 --> 01:01:18,020
I like the end...

862
01:01:18,820 --> 01:01:22,100
...where Eugene's journey was really...

863
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:24,500
...mystical, you know?

864
01:01:25,140 --> 01:01:28,020
It was almost like a pilgrimage.

865
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:31,180
Almost like a cop-out, if you ask me.

866
01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:33,900
Though those were the facts of Wolfe's life.

867
01:01:35,140 --> 01:01:37,900
The novel is what you would call
a roman à clef.

868
01:01:37,980 --> 01:01:39,620
You know what that is?

869
01:01:41,380 --> 01:01:43,100
Sure.

870
01:01:43,180 --> 01:01:47,100
Well, nonetheless, you can't escape
your demons just by leaving home.

871
01:01:47,740 --> 01:01:50,940
Although writers do find new freedom
when they relocate abroad.

872
01:01:51,020 --> 01:01:53,660
Take Henry Miller.
Have you read his trilogy?

873
01:01:54,180 --> 01:01:55,860
Plexus, Nexus and Sexus?

874
01:01:57,220 --> 01:01:59,140
-You haven't read that?
-No.

875
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:01,820
You're missing something.

876
01:02:02,420 --> 01:02:07,140
You know what?
I did read Tropic of Cancer.

877
01:02:07,620 --> 01:02:09,300
Just parts of it, though...

878
01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:13,260
...because I had to sneak it off
my parents' shelf, you know?

879
01:02:15,140 --> 01:02:18,900
His descriptions are pretty vivid,
I would say.

880
01:02:19,020 --> 01:02:21,300
In one of the novels, I don't recall which...

881
01:02:21,460 --> 01:02:25,020
...he describes an erection
as a piece of lead with wings on it.

882
01:02:25,380 --> 01:02:29,060
-I didn't read that part.
-Of course not. You're not allowed.

883
01:02:29,180 --> 01:02:32,260
Your parents don't want you
to achieve adulthood.

884
01:02:32,380 --> 01:02:35,500
They know the pitfalls of adulthood,
all that freedom.

885
01:02:35,580 --> 01:02:37,460
They know it only too well.

886
01:02:38,420 --> 01:02:41,620
Temptation to stray,
deflecting their guilt and anger onto you...

887
01:02:41,740 --> 01:02:45,140
...for a crime that's not even a crime,
for smoking grass.

888
01:02:50,620 --> 01:02:52,340
Wait a second.

889
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:55,300
Where are you from?

890
01:02:56,660 --> 01:02:57,700
Where am I from?

891
01:02:57,780 --> 01:02:59,940
-Yeah.
-Where do you think I'm from?

892
01:03:00,460 --> 01:03:02,100
I don't know, but...

893
01:03:02,180 --> 01:03:04,620
If I told you, you going to get mad at me?

894
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:14,540
I'm from the black forest.

895
01:03:18,260 --> 01:03:19,980
That's funny.

896
01:03:20,620 --> 01:03:23,700
You're not the Drama teacher, are you?

897
01:03:24,740 --> 01:03:26,540
Maybe I'm the big bad wolf.

898
01:03:31,460 --> 01:03:35,060
So you're that guy that's been
hanging around the house?

899
01:03:35,620 --> 01:03:38,140
You're the one that killed my mom's dog?

900
01:03:39,540 --> 01:03:41,900
-Your mom's dog was killed?
-Yeah.

901
01:03:42,620 --> 01:03:45,020
I didn't even know anything about that.

902
01:03:45,340 --> 01:03:46,780
That's a shame.

903
01:03:47,660 --> 01:03:49,300
That's a damn shame.

904
01:03:49,820 --> 01:03:51,180
Yes, it was.

905
01:03:51,580 --> 01:03:53,220
What kind of dog was it?

906
01:03:54,180 --> 01:03:56,100
I don't know. He was just...

907
01:03:56,580 --> 01:03:59,380
He was fluffy, and...

908
01:04:00,060 --> 01:04:01,420
Fluffy?

909
01:04:06,420 --> 01:04:08,020
So you didn't do that?

910
01:04:08,180 --> 01:04:10,380
Of course I didn't do that.

911
01:04:15,340 --> 01:04:17,820
-Okay.
-I wouldn't do that.

912
01:04:18,860 --> 01:04:21,380
So why... What are you doing here, then?

913
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:24,860
Well, I came to meet you,
to be honest with you.

914
01:04:28,380 --> 01:04:31,020
-Why? I mean...
-Because...

915
01:04:32,420 --> 01:04:35,580
...I wanted to meet you,
see what you're like.

916
01:04:35,980 --> 01:04:38,860
I see you're a nice person. That's all.

917
01:04:42,300 --> 01:04:45,860
-You're not going to hurt me, are you?
-I'm not going to hurt you at all.

918
01:04:45,940 --> 01:04:48,140
There's no hurting here, Danielle.

919
01:04:49,740 --> 01:04:53,340
Between us there's no anger, nothing.
Just a search for truth.

920
01:04:56,020 --> 01:04:59,980
Did you judge me, get angry at me
when you caught me smoking the grass?

921
01:05:01,180 --> 01:05:02,220
No.

922
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:07,660
But your parents judged you.
Got plenty angry at you, didn't they?

923
01:05:08,060 --> 01:05:09,500
Yeah.

924
01:05:09,820 --> 01:05:12,060
They punished you for their sins.

925
01:05:13,180 --> 01:05:14,620
What did they do?

926
01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:20,700
My dad...
They just yelled a whole lot and...

927
01:05:21,820 --> 01:05:23,140
...my mom cried...

928
01:05:23,220 --> 01:05:26,540
...and my dad said
I couldn't drive the Cherokee.

929
01:05:26,620 --> 01:05:30,460
I'd say they punished you
for their sins, and you resent that...

930
01:05:30,540 --> 01:05:32,460
...and you should resent it.

931
01:05:33,460 --> 01:05:36,460
But Professor do-right has
a little advice for you.

932
01:05:37,220 --> 01:05:39,540
You shouldn't damn them.
Don't judge them.

933
01:05:39,620 --> 01:05:42,500
Just forgive them,
for they know not what they do.

934
01:05:45,180 --> 01:05:47,260
Why do you hate my father?

935
01:05:47,340 --> 01:05:51,060
I don't hate him at all.
Oh, no. I pray for him.

936
01:05:51,580 --> 01:05:53,180
I'm here to help him.

937
01:05:54,820 --> 01:05:56,860
We all make mistakes, Danielle.

938
01:05:57,420 --> 01:06:00,020
You and I have. At least we try to admit it.

939
01:06:00,420 --> 01:06:01,700
Don't we?

940
01:06:02,180 --> 01:06:03,340
Yeah.

941
01:06:03,900 --> 01:06:05,700
But your daddy, he don't.

942
01:06:06,900 --> 01:06:10,780
Every man carries a circle of hell
around his head like a halo.

943
01:06:11,140 --> 01:06:13,260
Your daddy, too. Every man...

944
01:06:13,660 --> 01:06:17,740
...has to go through hell
to reach his paradise.

945
01:06:18,180 --> 01:06:19,940
You know what paradise is?

946
01:06:20,820 --> 01:06:22,380
-No.
-Salvation.

947
01:06:24,060 --> 01:06:25,980
'Cause your daddy's not happy.

948
01:06:26,060 --> 01:06:27,780
Your mommy's not happy.

949
01:06:28,060 --> 01:06:31,180
And you know what? You're not happy.

950
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:35,060
-Are you?
-No, I'm not.

951
01:06:39,940 --> 01:06:42,580
You thought about me last night,
didn't you?

952
01:06:47,460 --> 01:06:48,820
Yes, I did.

953
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:50,580
I know.

954
01:06:53,340 --> 01:06:56,500
You know, I think
I might have found a companion...

955
01:06:57,860 --> 01:07:00,540
...for that long walk to the light.

956
01:07:03,940 --> 01:07:06,340
Do you mind if I put my arm around you?

957
01:07:20,020 --> 01:07:21,140
It's okay.

958
01:07:23,340 --> 01:07:25,940
No, I don't mind.

959
01:07:26,020 --> 01:07:27,340
Okay.

960
01:08:54,900 --> 01:08:58,860
Kersek, where the hell have you been?
He came at my daughter at school.

961
01:08:58,940 --> 01:09:02,380
You asked me to watch him nights.
I'm watching nights. What happened?

962
01:09:02,460 --> 01:09:06,300
My wife, Leigh, found some marijuana
in one of Dani's schoolbooks.

963
01:09:06,380 --> 01:09:09,060
We don't know if Cady
gave it to her or what happened.

964
01:09:09,140 --> 01:09:11,260
She's scared and she won't talk about it.

965
01:09:11,340 --> 01:09:13,740
But this has gone far enough.
It's got to stop!

966
01:09:13,820 --> 01:09:16,500
-You phone the cops?
-No, I didn't phone the cops.

967
01:09:16,620 --> 01:09:19,740
What did you call them?
"Slow, skeptical pathetic, even."

968
01:09:19,980 --> 01:09:23,180
No, Leigh, that's all right.
Just hold on a minute.

969
01:09:25,460 --> 01:09:26,340
Kersek...

970
01:09:26,420 --> 01:09:30,380
...I want to hire those three guys,
you remember, the hospital job.

971
01:09:30,460 --> 01:09:33,340
Consider it done, the sooner the better.

972
01:09:33,540 --> 01:09:35,500
Three men are going to cost you a grand.

973
01:09:35,580 --> 01:09:38,460
It's not chicken feed
but you don't go with less than three.

974
01:09:38,540 --> 01:09:40,260
It's better to overdo it.

975
01:09:40,340 --> 01:09:42,420
You'll have the money in the morning.

976
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:45,060
We'll be on for tomorrow night.
And Sam...

977
01:09:46,420 --> 01:09:48,460
...you'll feel good about this.

978
01:09:51,180 --> 01:09:52,300
All right.

979
01:10:05,380 --> 01:10:07,540
Do you notice these young people?

980
01:10:07,780 --> 01:10:09,340
They don't look very happy.

981
01:10:09,420 --> 01:10:13,580
They're committed to their professions
and ambitions but not to each other.

982
01:10:13,660 --> 01:10:15,420
Cady, shut up and listen.

983
01:10:17,260 --> 01:10:18,900
If you don't leave...

984
01:10:19,220 --> 01:10:23,220
...my family alone
and you don't get out of here...

985
01:10:23,660 --> 01:10:26,740
...you're going to be hurting
like you never dreamed.

986
01:10:28,740 --> 01:10:30,740
-Could you repeat that?
-I said...

987
01:10:30,860 --> 01:10:33,020
...if you don't get out of here...

988
01:10:33,220 --> 01:10:36,220
...you're going to be hurting
like you never dreamed.

989
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:37,820
-A threat?
-Yeah.

990
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:39,860
You bet your ass that's a threat.

991
01:10:39,940 --> 01:10:41,700
I have thought of relocating...

992
01:10:41,780 --> 01:10:44,700
...where I'd be more appreciated,
California, perhaps.

993
01:10:44,780 --> 01:10:47,580
...I could teach earthquake preparedness.

994
01:10:48,180 --> 01:10:51,700
But then it hits me,
I love New Essex, Counselor.

995
01:10:52,780 --> 01:10:56,340
I mean, where else could I just
casually confer with an old colleague?

996
01:10:56,420 --> 01:10:59,660
We're not colleagues.
Do you understand that?

997
01:10:59,780 --> 01:11:02,460
-You think you're better than me.
-No, I don't.

998
01:11:02,540 --> 01:11:04,220
That's not the goddamned point.

999
01:11:04,300 --> 01:11:08,060
Good. If you're not better than me
then I can have what you have.

1000
01:11:08,500 --> 01:11:11,340
-What do I have?
-A wife, a daughter.

1001
01:11:13,860 --> 01:11:16,740
I'm going to teach you
the meaning of commitment.

1002
01:11:17,420 --> 01:11:21,420
Fourteen years ago, I was forced to make
a commitment to an eight-by-nine cell...

1003
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:24,660
...and now you're going to be forced
to make a commitment.

1004
01:11:24,740 --> 01:11:26,940
You could say I'm here to save you.

1005
01:11:30,220 --> 01:11:31,220
Fine.

1006
01:11:32,900 --> 01:11:34,740
Check out the Bible, Counselor...

1007
01:11:34,820 --> 01:11:37,220
...the book between Esther and Psalms.

1008
01:11:47,740 --> 01:11:49,020
You all right?

1009
01:11:50,340 --> 01:11:52,380
-Is everything all right?
-Yeah.

1010
01:11:56,060 --> 01:11:58,420
This isn't going to work, you know.

1011
01:11:58,500 --> 01:12:02,740
-What isn't going to work?
-Locking us in, hiding us from the world.

1012
01:12:02,820 --> 01:12:04,700
Oh, don't be so dramatic, Dani.

1013
01:12:04,780 --> 01:12:08,700
-Making me stay out of school.
-You're going back to school tomorrow.

1014
01:12:08,780 --> 01:12:11,260
And put some clothes on.
You're not a kid anymore.

1015
01:12:11,380 --> 01:12:15,340
Why am I going back to school tomorrow?
What are you going to do?

1016
01:12:15,420 --> 01:12:17,580
That's none of your concern, Dani.

1017
01:12:20,060 --> 01:12:21,100
Dad...

1018
01:12:22,220 --> 01:12:25,100
...he didn't force himself on me, you know.

1019
01:12:25,620 --> 01:12:28,060
I know you'd like to think that he did.

1020
01:12:28,740 --> 01:12:30,940
But I think he was...

1021
01:12:31,660 --> 01:12:34,660
I think he was just trying
to make a connection with me.

1022
01:12:34,740 --> 01:12:36,540
-You know?
-Now, Dani...

1023
01:12:36,820 --> 01:12:38,860
...I want you to listen to me.

1024
01:12:39,380 --> 01:12:41,220
No. Do you understand?

1025
01:12:42,940 --> 01:12:46,700
There will never be any connection
between you...

1026
01:12:47,220 --> 01:12:48,620
...and Max Cady.

1027
01:12:50,180 --> 01:12:51,740
You understand that?

1028
01:13:01,700 --> 01:13:03,180
Did he touch you?

1029
01:13:05,820 --> 01:13:07,740
What are you laughing about?

1030
01:13:08,180 --> 01:13:09,580
Why are you smiling?

1031
01:13:09,660 --> 01:13:12,300
I'm asking you a question.
Did he touch you?

1032
01:13:13,340 --> 01:13:15,260
Dani, wipe that smile off your face!

1033
01:13:15,340 --> 01:13:17,420
I'm asking you did he touch you?

1034
01:13:24,420 --> 01:13:27,180
Oh, wait, Dani. I'm sorry.

1035
01:13:29,780 --> 01:13:31,580
Wait, honey. I'm sorry.

1036
01:13:31,660 --> 01:13:33,500
Get out of here!

1037
01:14:41,020 --> 01:14:42,700
Come on.

1038
01:15:13,740 --> 01:15:15,180
Counselor?

1039
01:15:20,060 --> 01:15:21,500
Is that you?

1040
01:15:25,260 --> 01:15:28,260
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

1041
01:15:42,620 --> 01:15:44,620
I ain't no white trash piece of shit.

1042
01:15:44,700 --> 01:15:46,940
I'm better than you all.

1043
01:15:49,660 --> 01:15:51,780
I can out-learn you.

1044
01:15:52,860 --> 01:15:54,820
I can out-read you.

1045
01:15:54,900 --> 01:15:59,820
I can outthink you,
and I can out-philosophize you.

1046
01:15:59,940 --> 01:16:02,300
And I'm going to outlast you.

1047
01:16:02,380 --> 01:16:06,660
You think a couple whacks to my
good-old-boy gut will get me down?

1048
01:16:06,780 --> 01:16:09,420
It's going to take a hell of a lot
more than that...

1049
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:11,860
...to prove you're better than me!

1050
01:16:14,020 --> 01:16:18,220
"I am like God, and God like me.

1051
01:16:18,300 --> 01:16:21,020
"I am as large as God.

1052
01:16:21,100 --> 01:16:24,100
"He is as small as I.

1053
01:16:24,180 --> 01:16:28,780
"He cannot above me
nor I beneath him be."

1054
01:16:30,460 --> 01:16:34,020
Silesius, 17th century.

1055
01:16:45,900 --> 01:16:47,820
Could you be there?

1056
01:17:05,420 --> 01:17:07,340
I wonder if you're here.

1057
01:17:16,540 --> 01:17:18,140
Ah, fuck it.

1058
01:17:19,540 --> 01:17:22,300
If you're here,
what the fuck is the difference?

1059
01:17:23,420 --> 01:17:24,700
Fuck it!

1060
01:17:35,060 --> 01:17:37,940
-I've got Mr. Kersek on one.
-Good. I'll take it.

1061
01:17:39,420 --> 01:17:41,540
Sam, you look tired. You get that writ?

1062
01:17:41,620 --> 01:17:44,460
No, we have to get into that.
Let me just grab this.

1063
01:17:44,740 --> 01:17:46,980
-Kersek.
-I'm damn sorry about last night.

1064
01:17:47,060 --> 01:17:49,660
That son of a bitch could survive
a nuclear strike.

1065
01:17:49,740 --> 01:17:50,940
Hang on a second.

1066
01:17:51,020 --> 01:17:53,460
Tom, I'm not doing it. I pulled a fast one...

1067
01:17:53,540 --> 01:17:55,860
...and it's come back and bit me on the ass.

1068
01:17:55,940 --> 01:18:00,180
What you did was dumb. What I'm asking
is no big deal. This is my daughter!

1069
01:18:00,260 --> 01:18:03,860
No, it's perjury.
It's bullshit and I'm not doing it!

1070
01:18:03,980 --> 01:18:06,180
-All right?
-I'll be in my office.

1071
01:18:06,260 --> 01:18:08,100
Who was that top criminal lawyer?

1072
01:18:08,180 --> 01:18:10,540
Lee Heller. We need to talk.

1073
01:18:10,620 --> 01:18:13,420
If word gets out how Cady
bushwhacked those bastards...

1074
01:18:13,500 --> 01:18:15,340
...it'll be hard to get three new guys.

1075
01:18:15,420 --> 01:18:17,780
I don't want three new guys.
You hear me?

1076
01:18:17,860 --> 01:18:22,060
Mr. Heller, it's Sam Bowden
from Broadbent and Denmeyer.

1077
01:18:22,140 --> 01:18:26,340
Tom speaks very highly of you. He says
you're the best, and that's what I need.

1078
01:18:26,460 --> 01:18:29,940
We froze our butts together in Korea.
How can I help you, Sam?

1079
01:18:30,020 --> 01:18:34,620
It's a petition for a restraining order,
but there have been complications.

1080
01:18:34,700 --> 01:18:38,180
I know this is short notice,
but I need this injunction.

1081
01:18:38,260 --> 01:18:42,180
There's an ex-convict named Max Cady
who's been harassing my family.

1082
01:18:42,260 --> 01:18:45,580
I'm sorry, Mr. Bowden.
I can't continue this conversation.

1083
01:18:45,660 --> 01:18:50,060
-Is there a more convenient time?
-The damn thing is, I have a conflict.

1084
01:18:50,140 --> 01:18:51,860
-What would that be?
-You see...

1085
01:18:51,940 --> 01:18:54,860
...Mr. Cady retained my services yesterday.

1086
01:18:54,940 --> 01:18:57,980
-He what?
-In fact, I see on my phone sheet...

1087
01:18:58,060 --> 01:19:01,220
...Mr. Cady called this morning,
so I'm sure he'll fill me in...

1088
01:19:01,300 --> 01:19:04,540
But wait a minute, Lee.
This man is a psychotic.

1089
01:19:04,620 --> 01:19:08,180
It appears I'll be seeing you
at that hearing after all.

1090
01:19:09,860 --> 01:19:13,980
-Could you repeat that?
-I said, "If you don't leave...

1091
01:19:14,420 --> 01:19:18,580
"...my family alone
and if you don't get out of here...

1092
01:19:18,660 --> 01:19:21,820
"...you're gonna be hurting
like you never dreamed."

1093
01:19:22,460 --> 01:19:27,180
-A threat?
-You bet your ass that's a threat.

1094
01:19:27,260 --> 01:19:31,260
You need only glance
at my client to know...

1095
01:19:32,260 --> 01:19:37,780
...that Mr. Bowden made good
on his heinous and cowardly threat.

1096
01:19:38,420 --> 01:19:42,460
Just as God arose to judgment
to save all the meek of the earth...

1097
01:19:42,700 --> 01:19:45,540
...I hope and pray you will do the same, sir.

1098
01:19:45,620 --> 01:19:47,180
Your honor...

1099
01:19:47,940 --> 01:19:51,220
...Mr. Cady wouldn't have
surreptitiously taped our meeting...

1100
01:19:51,300 --> 01:19:53,260
...unless he knew that he'd...

1101
01:19:55,020 --> 01:19:59,100
This court does not condone...

1102
01:19:59,820 --> 01:20:03,740
...feuds, vendettas or vigilantism.

1103
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:09,300
Let me quote our great Negro educator,
Mr. Booker T. Washington.

1104
01:20:10,100 --> 01:20:14,260
"I will let no man drag me down so low...

1105
01:20:15,580 --> 01:20:18,060
"...as to make me hate him."

1106
01:20:18,220 --> 01:20:19,180
Yes.

1107
01:20:19,980 --> 01:20:22,580
I will grant the restraining order...

1108
01:20:22,700 --> 01:20:26,260
...not to validate the malice between you...

1109
01:20:26,340 --> 01:20:31,380
...but in the interest of Christian harmony.

1110
01:20:32,940 --> 01:20:36,020
You may not come within 500 yards...

1111
01:20:36,100 --> 01:20:40,740
...of Mr. Maximilian Cady...

1112
01:20:41,620 --> 01:20:46,580
...until such time as the court
may lift the injunction.

1113
01:20:46,980 --> 01:20:51,820
King Solomon could not have
adjudicated more wisely, your honor.

1114
01:20:52,580 --> 01:20:57,180
I am so offended by the Philistine tactics
of Mr. Bowden...

1115
01:20:57,500 --> 01:21:01,180
...I petitioned the A.B.A.
for his disbarment...

1116
01:21:01,660 --> 01:21:04,180
...on the grounds of moral turpitude.

1117
01:21:04,420 --> 01:21:07,460
Now, if you will excuse us, my client...

1118
01:21:07,540 --> 01:21:10,420
...is due back at the hospital...

1119
01:21:13,020 --> 01:21:17,460
...for the results of his numerous x-rays.

1120
01:21:19,940 --> 01:21:21,460
Kersek, I want a gun.

1121
01:21:21,540 --> 01:21:24,020
-I need a gun. I want a gun.
-You want a gun?

1122
01:21:24,100 --> 01:21:25,620
Yeah, I need a gun.

1123
01:21:25,820 --> 01:21:29,420
-Know anything about guns?
-I don't believe in them. Not in the house.

1124
01:21:29,500 --> 01:21:32,340
I'll get you a gun. What kind?
Now, calm down.

1125
01:21:32,620 --> 01:21:35,940
-Something simple I can handle.
-Let me see what fits you.

1126
01:21:36,020 --> 01:21:38,740
Forty-five...
Let me see your hands.

1127
01:21:40,860 --> 01:21:43,260
-A .38 snub-nosed special.
-All right. Good.

1128
01:21:43,340 --> 01:21:45,340
I can teach you how to use it.

1129
01:21:45,420 --> 01:21:47,660
-Great.
-The first lesson is this...

1130
01:21:47,780 --> 01:21:50,140
...don't think of it as trying to kill a man.

1131
01:21:50,220 --> 01:21:52,260
-Right.
-It's an extension of your fist.

1132
01:21:52,340 --> 01:21:54,540
You're just reaching out
and knocking him down.

1133
01:21:54,620 --> 01:21:56,220
Boom. All right.

1134
01:21:56,300 --> 01:21:58,940
Later on we'll shoot some trees, okay?

1135
01:21:59,020 --> 01:22:00,740
That'd be great. Good.

1136
01:22:03,340 --> 01:22:05,100
What is it? What?

1137
01:22:05,220 --> 01:22:06,780
-Well, Sam...
-Yeah?

1138
01:22:06,860 --> 01:22:09,420
I give you a gun. You pull it on Cady...

1139
01:22:09,540 --> 01:22:13,580
...it will dawn on you that shooting
a man is different than shooting a tree.

1140
01:22:13,660 --> 01:22:15,660
Next thing, you know, Cady has the gun.

1141
01:22:15,740 --> 01:22:19,860
You'll teach me. I could handle a gun.
He won't take it away.

1142
01:22:20,140 --> 01:22:22,980
Best-case scenario:
you kill Cady dog-dead.

1143
01:22:24,140 --> 01:22:27,260
Fifteen years to life.
Do you realize that, Counselor?

1144
01:22:33,220 --> 01:22:36,020
Oh, Jesus! It's all fucked up, Kersek!

1145
01:22:36,900 --> 01:22:40,340
I mean, the law considers me
more of a loose cannon than Max Cady!

1146
01:22:40,420 --> 01:22:44,740
Some big-shit attorney has whipped the
A.B.A.'s ethics committee into a frenzy.

1147
01:22:45,340 --> 01:22:48,340
There's an emergency session
in Raleigh over the assault.

1148
01:22:48,420 --> 01:22:50,180
How did they link that to you?

1149
01:22:50,260 --> 01:22:54,580
I went to warn Cady.
I thought it was the decent thing to do.

1150
01:22:54,660 --> 01:22:57,980
Maybe I'd scare him. He was wired.

1151
01:23:00,340 --> 01:23:02,300
Goddamn fools.

1152
01:23:05,660 --> 01:23:08,060
This hearing, it's real important?

1153
01:23:09,780 --> 01:23:14,220
Only if I want to continue to practice law.

1154
01:23:14,300 --> 01:23:16,460
Cady isn't expected there, is he?

1155
01:23:17,180 --> 01:23:19,260
Mr. Cady, he's beyond reproach.

1156
01:23:19,460 --> 01:23:21,860
-But you're required to be there.
-Yeah.

1157
01:23:22,380 --> 01:23:25,420
-When is this hearing?
-It's Thursday morning, 9:00.

1158
01:23:25,780 --> 01:23:28,500
The torture begins and lasts for two days.

1159
01:23:29,580 --> 01:23:31,820
You have to fly up the night before?

1160
01:23:31,940 --> 01:23:33,140
Right.

1161
01:23:33,980 --> 01:23:37,820
Cady's an opportunist.
If he thinks you're gone for two days...

1162
01:23:37,900 --> 01:23:41,060
...that's going to be as tempting to him
as shit is to a fly.

1163
01:23:41,300 --> 01:23:43,100
If Cady breaks into your home...

1164
01:23:43,180 --> 01:23:44,700
...he can be killed.

1165
01:23:44,780 --> 01:23:46,020
Justifiably.

1166
01:23:47,980 --> 01:23:51,500
But he won't show unless
he's sure you won't be there.

1167
01:25:00,260 --> 01:25:02,980
-Have a good trip.
-All right. Bye-bye.

1168
01:25:03,060 --> 01:25:05,220
-Call us tonight, okay?
-All right.

1169
01:25:15,900 --> 01:25:19,980
-I didn't miss the 9:20 to Raleigh?
-I'm afraid you did. There's a 10:20.

1170
01:25:20,100 --> 01:25:24,100
It's not that. I have some
important papers for Samuel Bowden.

1171
01:25:24,660 --> 01:25:26,140
Was he on the 9:20?

1172
01:25:26,740 --> 01:25:29,220
We can't give out that information, sir.

1173
01:25:29,300 --> 01:25:31,020
Well, it's just...

1174
01:25:31,380 --> 01:25:33,660
...I guess I could send it to him overnight...

1175
01:25:33,740 --> 01:25:37,540
...but he might be back, for all I know,
tomorrow morning, and I...

1176
01:25:38,620 --> 01:25:40,220
See, I...

1177
01:25:40,300 --> 01:25:43,700
My wife and I have been in an accident,
and he's our lawyer.

1178
01:25:43,780 --> 01:25:47,900
If I don't get in touch with him,
we could lose this case.

1179
01:25:47,980 --> 01:25:50,660
We've already lost our little daughter Dani.

1180
01:25:52,180 --> 01:25:53,260
Is...

1181
01:25:54,940 --> 01:25:59,020
Is there any way to know if he was
on that flight and when he's returning?

1182
01:25:59,100 --> 01:26:00,980
It'd really help us.

1183
01:26:11,380 --> 01:26:13,900
He'll be back the day after tomorrow, sir.

1184
01:26:13,980 --> 01:26:15,420
Bless your heart.

1185
01:26:31,380 --> 01:26:32,700
Go on in.

1186
01:26:35,180 --> 01:26:36,420
Get down, Sam.

1187
01:26:43,180 --> 01:26:44,700
Give me a cigarette.

1188
01:26:45,540 --> 01:26:48,980
Slow down. You're outpacing me
two-to-one since you started again.

1189
01:26:49,060 --> 01:26:51,460
Just keep track of how many I owe you.

1190
01:26:53,460 --> 01:26:56,020
-How'd it go at the airport?
-We did our thing...

1191
01:26:56,100 --> 01:26:59,260
...but we don't know if he saw us,
or if he was there.

1192
01:27:00,060 --> 01:27:01,900
Set the trap and we'll see.

1193
01:27:02,660 --> 01:27:04,140
What if we don't want to see?

1194
01:27:04,220 --> 01:27:05,620
-Dani!
-What?

1195
01:27:05,740 --> 01:27:07,820
Maybe he poisoned the dog.

1196
01:27:07,900 --> 01:27:09,980
Sam, watch out for the windows.

1197
01:27:10,060 --> 01:27:12,580
You're not allowed to stand up, remember?

1198
01:27:19,620 --> 01:27:22,140
-Didn't Cady go after her?
-You don't know Dani.

1199
01:27:22,220 --> 01:27:25,900
If she finds a palmetto bug in her bedroom,
she takes it outside.

1200
01:27:26,180 --> 01:27:28,420
You know, she could never kill anything.

1201
01:27:28,540 --> 01:27:30,500
Even a six-foot palmetto bug?

1202
01:27:33,100 --> 01:27:34,540
Oh, God.

1203
01:27:43,220 --> 01:27:44,460
What is that?

1204
01:27:45,500 --> 01:27:48,780
It's monofilament line.
I got it from Sam's fishing gear.

1205
01:27:49,100 --> 01:27:51,660
I stretch it across the windows
and the doors...

1206
01:27:51,740 --> 01:27:53,820
...and tie it to Dani's teddy bear here.

1207
01:27:53,940 --> 01:27:58,940
If the bear moves a quarter of an inch,
I know if the holy ghost is sneaking in.

1208
01:28:29,100 --> 01:28:30,700
What are you reading?

1209
01:28:35,380 --> 01:28:37,700
-Why? Did Kersek quit?
-No.

1210
01:28:38,540 --> 01:28:40,340
It's just that Cady said...

1211
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:42,140
You want some answers.

1212
01:28:43,780 --> 01:28:45,260
Me, too.

1213
01:28:47,300 --> 01:28:49,900
I'd like to know just how strong we are...

1214
01:28:50,900 --> 01:28:52,180
...or how weak.

1215
01:28:54,780 --> 01:28:58,340
But I guess the only way
we're going to find that out is by...

1216
01:28:58,540 --> 01:29:00,140
...going through this.

1217
01:29:03,900 --> 01:29:07,700
It's just that Cady said to read the book
between Esther and Psalms.

1218
01:29:08,620 --> 01:29:10,260
Which is which one?

1219
01:29:10,740 --> 01:29:12,140
The book of Job.

1220
01:29:15,260 --> 01:29:18,140
Job was a good man. He believed in God...

1221
01:29:19,260 --> 01:29:21,180
...and God tested his faith.

1222
01:29:21,860 --> 01:29:24,020
He took away everything he had...

1223
01:29:25,740 --> 01:29:27,300
...even his children.

1224
01:29:43,820 --> 01:29:46,500
It's hideous, this plan. I mean, barbaric.

1225
01:29:46,980 --> 01:29:49,900
They're crazy.
My dad's turned into some kind of...

1226
01:29:50,260 --> 01:29:51,460
I don't know what.

1227
01:29:51,540 --> 01:29:52,740
Barbaric.

1228
01:29:56,180 --> 01:30:00,500
Listen to your father.
Do what they say. What else can you do?

1229
01:30:00,580 --> 01:30:02,580
Leave. We could go to the houseboat...

1230
01:30:02,660 --> 01:30:05,180
...you know, and get lost in any inlet.

1231
01:30:10,340 --> 01:30:11,620
Dani, come on.

1232
01:30:12,300 --> 01:30:13,820
Don't stay outside.

1233
01:30:20,900 --> 01:30:23,500
Do you want to know
what really disturbs me?

1234
01:30:24,140 --> 01:30:25,740
Killing this guy.

1235
01:30:26,700 --> 01:30:28,620
I mean, taking a man's life.

1236
01:30:30,580 --> 01:30:32,900
I don't know if I can live with that.

1237
01:30:33,580 --> 01:30:35,060
You may have to.

1238
01:30:35,580 --> 01:30:38,340
-Sam, just remember the plan.
-I know the plan.

1239
01:30:38,540 --> 01:30:41,060
Damn, it's premeditated.

1240
01:30:41,620 --> 01:30:44,820
It makes me an accomplice,
an accessory, an abettor.

1241
01:30:45,540 --> 01:30:47,340
It's also excessive force.

1242
01:30:47,420 --> 01:30:50,100
The only thing excessive
we could do to Cady...

1243
01:30:50,180 --> 01:30:52,740
...would be to gut him and eat his liver.

1244
01:30:52,900 --> 01:30:54,300
That might be excessive.

1245
01:30:54,380 --> 01:30:56,540
Jesus Christ, Kersek, I'm serious.

1246
01:30:56,860 --> 01:30:58,940
No, you're scared.

1247
01:30:59,260 --> 01:31:00,660
But that's okay.

1248
01:31:01,140 --> 01:31:03,140
I want you to savor that fear.

1249
01:31:03,780 --> 01:31:05,860
You know, the South evolved in fear...

1250
01:31:05,940 --> 01:31:08,380
...fear of the Indian, fear of the slave...

1251
01:31:08,460 --> 01:31:10,260
...fear of the damn Union.

1252
01:31:11,220 --> 01:31:14,020
The South has a fine tradition
of savoring fear.

1253
01:31:32,140 --> 01:31:33,620
What's the matter?

1254
01:31:34,260 --> 01:31:35,980
Don't look over!

1255
01:31:36,860 --> 01:31:38,580
She's making me nervous.

1256
01:31:39,940 --> 01:31:41,700
What would she normally do...

1257
01:31:41,780 --> 01:31:44,020
...if Sam wasn't around to run her home?

1258
01:31:44,100 --> 01:31:45,940
-She'd stay...
-She'd stay over.

1259
01:31:46,020 --> 01:31:47,860
Well, then, she stays over.

1260
01:34:24,380 --> 01:34:25,900
-What?
-Leigh.

1261
01:34:26,380 --> 01:34:28,100
I know how the dog died.

1262
01:34:29,580 --> 01:34:31,380
-Sam, are you dreaming?
-No!

1263
01:34:31,460 --> 01:34:34,900
I just had the weirdest feeling
he was already in the house.

1264
01:34:50,100 --> 01:34:51,820
Can't sleep, Miss Graciela?

1265
01:34:52,300 --> 01:34:53,620
Yeah. It's hot.

1266
01:34:55,220 --> 01:34:59,020
You know, I think it's the humidity
that makes us all so thirsty.

1267
01:35:00,780 --> 01:35:02,500
Excuse me.

1268
01:35:03,380 --> 01:35:05,300
My pop was a cop.

1269
01:35:06,060 --> 01:35:07,300
Twenty years.

1270
01:35:07,980 --> 01:35:10,580
This was his favorite drink on a stakeout.

1271
01:35:29,900 --> 01:35:32,340
I learned that in prison. You like?

1272
01:35:32,780 --> 01:35:34,580
White trash piece of shit.

1273
01:35:43,900 --> 01:35:45,300
Stay here, Leigh.

1274
01:35:51,620 --> 01:35:52,660
Kersek?

1275
01:36:08,380 --> 01:36:10,740
Dani, go back to your room.

1276
01:36:10,820 --> 01:36:12,100
Lock the door.

1277
01:36:18,980 --> 01:36:21,700
-Don't go down there, Sam.
-No, it's all right.

1278
01:36:50,020 --> 01:36:51,540
Dani, don't look.

1279
01:36:52,060 --> 01:36:54,100
Oh, my God, Graciela!

1280
01:36:57,340 --> 01:36:58,500
Oh, my God.

1281
01:37:24,900 --> 01:37:26,460
It's the piano wire.

1282
01:37:32,580 --> 01:37:34,900
I'm going to get this son of a bitch!

1283
01:37:43,580 --> 01:37:45,100
Tell him to stop!

1284
01:37:47,260 --> 01:37:49,220
God, he might be out here!

1285
01:38:30,420 --> 01:38:32,580
Listen, I've got Kersek's gun with me...

1286
01:38:32,700 --> 01:38:36,220
...and you'll find the piano wire
that Cady used in the house.

1287
01:38:36,300 --> 01:38:38,580
Yeah, I know how this looks.

1288
01:38:38,780 --> 01:38:41,180
You're not supposed to flee
a murder scene.

1289
01:38:41,260 --> 01:38:43,580
Listen, Lieutenant.
You may not know this...

1290
01:38:43,660 --> 01:38:46,700
...but in the law there's something
called force majeure.

1291
01:38:46,780 --> 01:38:49,220
It means an unforeseeable act of God...

1292
01:38:49,340 --> 01:38:52,020
...and it cancels all promises
and obligations.

1293
01:38:52,100 --> 01:38:54,540
So, legally speaking, all bets are off.

1294
01:38:54,940 --> 01:38:58,100
You find Max Cady and we'll come back.

1295
01:39:00,700 --> 01:39:03,020
-What did he say?
-He said we're fugitives.

1296
01:39:03,100 --> 01:39:05,580
-What's that mean?
-It means we're doing something right.

1297
01:39:33,820 --> 01:39:36,820
Where's that old mongrel dog of yours,
Mrs. Bowden?

1298
01:41:57,940 --> 01:41:59,980
Tomorrow, I'll catch some fish.

1299
01:42:00,500 --> 01:42:04,580
Oh, you know, you don't have to.
I've got enough food to last us a week.

1300
01:42:13,020 --> 01:42:14,460
But it'd be nice.

1301
01:42:16,020 --> 01:42:16,940
Good.

1302
01:42:26,420 --> 01:42:28,580
It's only rain. A sheet of rain.

1303
01:42:33,060 --> 01:42:35,260
-What was that?
-It's just a squall.

1304
01:42:36,900 --> 01:42:39,460
-I'll go check the anchor.
-Wait, Dad. Don't go out.

1305
01:42:39,540 --> 01:42:42,340
No, Danielle. Everything is okay. All right?

1306
01:42:42,420 --> 01:42:46,180
-Yeah. We're on the river now, baby.
-It's just a squall kicking.

1307
01:43:11,260 --> 01:43:13,260
Graciela has a brother.

1308
01:43:13,620 --> 01:43:17,460
I mean, she had a brother.

1309
01:43:18,460 --> 01:43:19,620
Oh, sweetie.

1310
01:43:22,260 --> 01:43:24,700
We'll get in touch with him right away.

1311
01:43:27,980 --> 01:43:29,700
We're making some tea.

1312
01:43:40,420 --> 01:43:42,540
I can't hear you. It's windy out.

1313
01:44:23,900 --> 01:44:25,060
What's that?

1314
01:44:25,540 --> 01:44:26,860
Are we moving?

1315
01:44:31,860 --> 01:44:33,260
'Evening, ladies.

1316
01:44:34,820 --> 01:44:36,740
You know my husband has a gun?

1317
01:44:36,820 --> 01:44:38,060
Not this gun?

1318
01:44:38,500 --> 01:44:40,700
-Is it this gun?
-Where is he?

1319
01:44:40,780 --> 01:44:43,420
Resting up. He had a long difficult day.

1320
01:44:44,260 --> 01:44:48,700
Danielle, I told you, you can't escape
your demons just by leaving home.

1321
01:44:49,780 --> 01:44:50,940
I didn't.

1322
01:44:51,900 --> 01:44:54,300
-My parents brought me here.
-Of course.

1323
01:44:55,260 --> 01:44:56,540
Where's Sexus?

1324
01:44:57,300 --> 01:44:59,900
-Back at the house.
-Shame.

1325
01:45:00,340 --> 01:45:03,220
I had hoped we could
read aloud from it together.

1326
01:45:05,340 --> 01:45:07,740
Well, I...

1327
01:45:08,260 --> 01:45:10,740
-...memorized some for you.
-Did you?

1328
01:45:10,820 --> 01:45:12,540
-Yeah.
-Did you?

1329
01:45:16,020 --> 01:45:17,540
Well, I'm impressed.

1330
01:45:18,780 --> 01:45:19,980
Which part?

1331
01:45:22,220 --> 01:45:23,900
The part...

1332
01:45:25,220 --> 01:45:27,300
...you know what part, you know.

1333
01:45:28,620 --> 01:45:31,900
-I don't think you did your homework.
-I did.

1334
01:45:32,900 --> 01:45:34,380
What parts were they?

1335
01:45:36,700 --> 01:45:37,940
The good parts?

1336
01:45:38,420 --> 01:45:39,900
Yeah. They were...

1337
01:45:39,980 --> 01:45:42,220
-Were you a good girl?
-I was.

1338
01:45:42,420 --> 01:45:44,380
I knew you'd follow me here and...

1339
01:45:44,460 --> 01:45:46,380
You know me pretty well, don't you?

1340
01:45:46,460 --> 01:45:48,620
Yeah. I do.

1341
01:45:49,100 --> 01:45:51,660
You're going to know me a lot better, too.

1342
01:45:57,260 --> 01:45:59,420
Are you offering me something hot?

1343
01:46:00,660 --> 01:46:03,180
Let's get something straight here.

1344
01:46:05,180 --> 01:46:09,140
I spent fourteen years
in an eight-by-nine cell...

1345
01:46:09,220 --> 01:46:12,100
...surrounded by people
who were less than human.

1346
01:46:13,380 --> 01:46:16,500
My mission in that time was
to become more than human.

1347
01:46:18,180 --> 01:46:19,220
You see?

1348
01:46:20,860 --> 01:46:23,460
Granddaddy used to handle
snakes in church.

1349
01:46:23,780 --> 01:46:25,140
Granny drank strychnine.

1350
01:46:25,220 --> 01:46:28,260
You could say I had a leg-up,
genetically speaking.

1351
01:46:37,140 --> 01:46:39,700
I'm going to forgive you, Danielle, honey.

1352
01:46:40,140 --> 01:46:42,820
I know that wasn't the real you,
the true you.

1353
01:46:42,940 --> 01:46:45,460
But I would like you to wait in the hold.

1354
01:46:48,660 --> 01:46:50,940
Danielle, get in the hold.

1355
01:46:54,700 --> 01:46:56,020
-Stop!
-No!

1356
01:47:04,660 --> 01:47:06,900
Ready to be born again, Mrs. Bowden?

1357
01:47:11,020 --> 01:47:15,060
A few minutes alone with me, darling,
and you'll be speaking in tongues.

1358
01:48:33,940 --> 01:48:35,500
Excuse me, Mrs. B.

1359
01:48:35,820 --> 01:48:37,420
Please don't take umbrage...

1360
01:48:37,500 --> 01:48:40,100
...but in the plan that I have formulated...

1361
01:48:40,500 --> 01:48:43,860
...there's much more to it
than just you and I making love.

1362
01:48:43,940 --> 01:48:46,020
I mean, that's just so...

1363
01:48:46,780 --> 01:48:48,580
...commonplace and dreary.

1364
01:48:50,460 --> 01:48:52,500
Here and now, we have an opportunity.

1365
01:48:52,580 --> 01:48:54,660
"What is that opportunity?" you ask.

1366
01:48:54,740 --> 01:48:57,300
Why, here and now,
we have an opportunity...

1367
01:48:57,380 --> 01:49:00,420
...to depict and dramatize...

1368
01:49:03,300 --> 01:49:05,660
...both the heights and the depths...

1369
01:49:06,900 --> 01:49:10,420
...of a mama's true love of her daughter,
if you get my meaning.

1370
01:49:10,500 --> 01:49:13,180
Come on out, babe.
Come on, darling. Let's go.

1371
01:49:13,300 --> 01:49:16,020
Get out. Get up here.

1372
01:49:16,420 --> 01:49:19,380
This is between you and me.
Leave them out of it.

1373
01:49:19,460 --> 01:49:23,420
This is my night, Counselor.
Don't you step on my lines.

1374
01:49:24,900 --> 01:49:25,780
Stop!

1375
01:49:28,100 --> 01:49:29,260
Yes, Leigh?

1376
01:49:29,940 --> 01:49:32,180
Listen to me, Max.

1377
01:49:35,500 --> 01:49:38,500
You know, Max, since all this started...

1378
01:49:38,740 --> 01:49:40,780
...I've thought about you all the time.

1379
01:49:40,860 --> 01:49:45,940
I've tried to imagine
what it must have been like for you...

1380
01:49:46,300 --> 01:49:48,580
...all those years, locked up in jail.

1381
01:49:48,660 --> 01:49:53,820
I've tried to imagine you
and even your crimes...

1382
01:49:53,980 --> 01:49:57,660
...and how you must have felt
in those moments that you did them.

1383
01:49:58,340 --> 01:50:01,980
See, I know about loss, Max.

1384
01:50:02,060 --> 01:50:06,700
I know about losing time,
even losing years.

1385
01:50:07,620 --> 01:50:11,660
And I know it doesn't compare to jail, but...

1386
01:50:12,580 --> 01:50:14,340
...I can understand...

1387
01:50:14,780 --> 01:50:17,020
...and I could share this with you.

1388
01:50:17,140 --> 01:50:21,940
Because of that whatever it is
that you've got planned...

1389
01:50:22,220 --> 01:50:24,540
...I want you to do it just with me...

1390
01:50:26,100 --> 01:50:27,660
...not with her...

1391
01:50:28,460 --> 01:50:29,740
...because...

1392
01:50:31,700 --> 01:50:33,660
...we have this connection.

1393
01:50:45,180 --> 01:50:47,180
What do you think, Counselor?

1394
01:50:52,660 --> 01:50:54,660
That was real eloquent, Leigh.

1395
01:50:56,980 --> 01:50:58,300
Brave, too.

1396
01:50:58,900 --> 01:51:02,860
I want to thank you for conveying to me
your most powerful emotions...

1397
01:51:03,940 --> 01:51:05,060
...because...

1398
01:51:10,900 --> 01:51:13,180
...I'm going to enjoy this all the more.

1399
01:51:23,300 --> 01:51:24,460
Oh, my God!

1400
01:52:22,140 --> 01:52:25,460
The people call Samuel J. Bowden!

1401
01:52:29,140 --> 01:52:32,380
Do you swear to tell the truth
and nothing but the truth?

1402
01:52:32,460 --> 01:52:35,500
-Somebody's got to man the boat.
-Did you swear?

1403
01:52:35,620 --> 01:52:37,100
-I'll do it.
-Sit, Danielle.

1404
01:52:37,180 --> 01:52:40,260
Don't make light of your civic duty.
You're the jury.

1405
01:52:41,460 --> 01:52:44,580
All right, I swear to tell the truth.
What do you want to know?

1406
01:52:44,660 --> 01:52:48,660
Was a prior sexual history ever prepared
in connection with my defense?

1407
01:52:53,180 --> 01:52:54,180
It's...

1408
01:52:56,020 --> 01:52:58,420
I'm sorry, Your Honor.
That was argumentative.

1409
01:52:58,500 --> 01:53:02,380
An investigator did prepare a prior
sexual history on the alleged victim...

1410
01:53:02,460 --> 01:53:03,660
...true?

1411
01:53:03,740 --> 01:53:07,340
I can ask leading questions, Your Honor.
He is a hostile witness.

1412
01:53:07,420 --> 01:53:11,220
Would you care to tell the court
what the gist was of this report?

1413
01:53:11,300 --> 01:53:13,900
It was fourteen years ago.
I can't remember that.

1414
01:53:14,820 --> 01:53:17,340
How can he answer
when you're hitting him?

1415
01:53:18,060 --> 01:53:21,540
Because he's perjuring himself.
He knows damn well what it said.

1416
01:53:21,620 --> 01:53:24,460
-Don't you?
-It said that she was promiscuous.

1417
01:53:24,540 --> 01:53:27,900
It said she had three different lovers
in one month.

1418
01:53:28,100 --> 01:53:31,460
At least three! And did you show
this report to the D.A.?

1419
01:53:35,940 --> 01:53:40,460
I found it when I started representing
myself six years into my sentence!

1420
01:53:40,620 --> 01:53:42,540
But there it was in the court file.

1421
01:53:42,620 --> 01:53:45,140
Back in '77, you buried it, Counselor.

1422
01:53:45,220 --> 01:53:47,900
Would you care to tell the jury why?

1423
01:53:49,500 --> 01:53:51,900
Would you care to tell the court why?

1424
01:53:54,260 --> 01:53:57,020
Because I know he brutally raped her
and he beat her.

1425
01:53:57,100 --> 01:53:59,140
Talk to me! I'm standing here!

1426
01:54:00,060 --> 01:54:03,180
Just because she was promiscuous
doesn't justify you raping her!

1427
01:54:03,260 --> 01:54:06,980
You bragged that you beat two prior
aggravated rapes. You were a menace!

1428
01:54:07,060 --> 01:54:08,620
You were my lawyer!

1429
01:54:10,260 --> 01:54:13,020
That report could have saved me
fourteen years.

1430
01:54:13,100 --> 01:54:15,980
-You're probably right.
-You self-righteous fuck!

1431
01:54:20,860 --> 01:54:24,220
I'm Virgil and I'm guiding you
through the gates of Hell.

1432
01:54:24,300 --> 01:54:27,860
We are now in the 9th circle,
the circle of traitors.

1433
01:54:28,300 --> 01:54:31,380
Traitors to country,
traitors to fellow man...

1434
01:54:31,740 --> 01:54:33,540
...traitors to God!

1435
01:54:33,820 --> 01:54:38,060
You, sir, are charged with
betraying the principles of all three!

1436
01:54:38,460 --> 01:54:40,860
Can you please quote for me the A.B.A.'s...

1437
01:54:40,940 --> 01:54:43,660
...Rules of Professional Conduct, Canon 7?

1438
01:54:45,140 --> 01:54:47,460
"A lawyer should represent his client..."

1439
01:54:47,540 --> 01:54:51,140
"Should zealously represent his client
within the bounds of the law."

1440
01:54:51,220 --> 01:54:54,020
And I find you guilty, Counselor...

1441
01:54:54,100 --> 01:54:56,420
...guilty of betraying your fellow man...

1442
01:54:56,500 --> 01:54:58,500
...guilty of betraying your country...

1443
01:54:58,580 --> 01:55:00,740
...guilty of abrogating your oath...

1444
01:55:00,820 --> 01:55:03,460
...guilty of judging me and selling me out!

1445
01:55:03,740 --> 01:55:07,140
And with the power vested in me
by the kingdom of God...

1446
01:55:07,460 --> 01:55:11,780
...I sentence you to the 9th circle of Hell!

1447
01:55:11,860 --> 01:55:14,580
Now you will learn about loss...

1448
01:55:14,860 --> 01:55:18,620
...loss of freedom, loss of humanity.

1449
01:55:19,100 --> 01:55:22,980
Now you and I will truly
be the same, Counselor.

1450
01:55:23,140 --> 01:55:25,260
Danielle, get down on your knees.

1451
01:55:25,340 --> 01:55:26,580
Take off your clothes!

1452
01:55:26,660 --> 01:55:28,380
Down on your knees now!

1453
01:55:30,860 --> 01:55:33,580
Take off your clothes!
Get down on your knees!

1454
01:55:36,540 --> 01:55:38,220
Don't!

1455
01:55:40,700 --> 01:55:44,060
Now, off with your clothes!

1456
01:55:44,220 --> 01:55:48,780
You, Leigh, take off your clothes. Now!

1457
01:55:50,620 --> 01:55:53,140
Come on!

1458
01:55:54,820 --> 01:55:56,740
Tonight, you'll learn to be an animal...

1459
01:55:56,820 --> 01:55:59,500
...to live like an animal and to die like one.

1460
01:56:03,140 --> 01:56:04,780
Give me your hand!

1461
01:56:39,020 --> 01:56:40,220
Go!

1462
01:59:05,860 --> 01:59:08,900
Did you forget about that
restraining order, Counselor?

1463
01:59:08,980 --> 01:59:11,340
You're well within 500 yards!

1464
01:59:18,340 --> 01:59:20,220
Well, here we are, Counselor...

1465
01:59:20,300 --> 01:59:21,940
...just two lawyers...

1466
01:59:22,100 --> 01:59:23,540
...working it out!

1467
01:59:37,380 --> 01:59:39,140
I'm going to kill you!

1468
01:59:39,300 --> 01:59:42,220
You already sacrificed me, Counselor.

1469
02:00:27,940 --> 02:00:30,860
"On Jordan's stormy banks I stand

1470
02:00:31,060 --> 02:00:33,300
"Oh who will come and go with me

1471
02:00:33,940 --> 02:00:37,340
"I am bound for the promised land"

1472
02:02:39,460 --> 02:02:41,780
We never spoke about what happened...

1473
02:02:42,180 --> 02:02:44,180
...at least not to each other.

1474
02:02:45,260 --> 02:02:47,180
Fear, I suppose...

1475
02:02:47,860 --> 02:02:50,980
...that to remember his name
or what he did...

1476
02:02:51,340 --> 02:02:53,940
...would mean letting him into our dreams.

1477
02:02:54,900 --> 02:02:58,220
And me, I hardly dream
about him anymore.

1478
02:03:00,140 --> 02:03:03,620
Still, things won't ever be
the way they were before he came.

1479
02:03:04,300 --> 02:03:06,020
But that's all right...

1480
02:03:06,300 --> 02:03:10,260
...because if you hang onto the past,
you die a little every day.

1481
02:03:11,140 --> 02:03:12,580
And for myself...

1482
02:03:13,300 --> 02:03:15,060
...I know I'd rather live.
