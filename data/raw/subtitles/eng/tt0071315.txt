1
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:40,994
Enough's enough, Curly. You can't eat
the Venetian blinds, I just got them.

2
00:02:57,678 --> 00:03:00,222
Down the hatch.

3
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:14,486
- She's no good.
- What can I tell you?

4
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:18,782
When you're right, you're right.
And you're right.

5
00:03:18,991 --> 00:03:24,246
I'll pay you the rest next week.
We only caught 60 tons of skipjack.

6
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:28,709
They pay less for skipjack
than albacore tuna.

7
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:34,590
I only brought it up to illustrate a point.
I don't want your last dime.

8
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:39,511
- Thank you, Mr Gittes.
- Call me Jake. Careful driving home.

9
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:45,225
Mrs Mulwray is waiting for you,
with Mr Walsh and Mr Duffy.

10
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:48,020
Mrs Mulwray, may I present Mr Gittes.

11
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:52,524
- Mrs Mulwray, how do you?
- Mr Gittes.

12
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:56,278
What seems to be the problem?

13
00:03:56,486 --> 00:04:01,158
My husband... I believe
is seeing another woman.

14
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:07,539
No... really?
I am sorry.

15
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:11,376
Mr Gittes, do you think
we could discuss this alone?

16
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:16,840
I'm afraid not.
These are my operatives, -

17
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:20,135
- and at some point
they'll have to assist me.

18
00:04:20,344 --> 00:04:24,014
- I can't do everything myself.
- Of course not.

19
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:35,108
What makes you certain that your
husband is involved with someone?

20
00:04:35,317 --> 00:04:38,278
A wife can tell.

21
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:43,367
- Do you love your husband?
- Yes, of course.

22
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:46,245
Then go home and forget everything.

23
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:52,876
I'm sure he loves you too. Do you know
the expression: Let sleeping dogs lie?

24
00:04:53,085 --> 00:04:57,631
- You're better off not knowing.
- I have to know.

25
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:05,138
Very well.

26
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:10,352
- What is your husband's first name?
- Hollis. Hollis Mulwray.

27
00:05:10,561 --> 00:05:16,108
- Water and Power?
- He's chief engineer.

28
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:19,319
Chief engineer?

29
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:31,999
This type of investigation
can be hard on your pocketbook.

30
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:36,920
- It takes time...
- Money doesn't matter to me.

31
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:44,970
Okay, we'll see what we can do.

32
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:53,645
Today you can hop a streetcar, and in
25 minutes, you end up in the Pacific.

33
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:58,108
You can swim in it and fish in it,
but you can't drink it.

34
00:05:58,317 --> 00:06:01,570
You can't
irrigate an orange grove with it.

35
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:06,700
We live next door to the ocean,
but we also live on the edge of a desert.

36
00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:09,870
Los Angeles is a desert community.

37
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:13,749
Beneath this building is a desert.

38
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:18,170
Without water, the dust will rise up
cover us as though we never existed.

39
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:21,632
The Alto Vallejo can save us from this.

40
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:27,179
I suggest that 8½ million dollars
is a fair price to pay -

41
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:31,850
- to keep the desert from our streets,
and not on top of them.

42
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:40,651
Mayor Bagby... Let's hear from
all the departments again.

43
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:44,905
We'd better take Water and Power first.
Mr Mulwray?

44
00:06:56,834 --> 00:07:02,464
In case you've forgotten, over 500 died
when the Van der Lip Dam gave way.

45
00:07:04,675 --> 00:07:11,598
This shale is similar to the permeable
shale in the Van der Lip disaster.

46
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:15,394
It couldn't withstand
that kind of pressure.

47
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:19,189
Now you propose
another dirt-banked dam, -

48
00:07:19,398 --> 00:07:25,571
- with slopes of 2½ to 1, 112 feet high,
and a 12,000-acre water surface.

49
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:30,242
Well, it won't hold.
I won't build it, it's that simple.

50
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:34,413
I'm not going to make
the same mistake twice.

51
00:07:46,258 --> 00:07:50,637
What the hell are you doing?
Get those goddam things out of here!

52
00:07:50,846 --> 00:07:56,059
Tell me where to take them!
You don't have an answer for that.

53
00:07:56,268 --> 00:08:02,733
You steal water from the valley,
ruin the grazing, starve the livestock...

54
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:07,404
Who's paying you to do that, Mulwray?
That's what I want to know!

55
00:12:53,565 --> 00:12:57,736
- Jeez, he was there all night.
- That's right.

56
00:12:57,945 --> 00:13:02,574
I had to go back three times
to pick up the watches.

57
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:12,584
Yesterday he went to three reservoirs,
a men's room, and the Pig & Whistle.

58
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:16,505
The guy's got water on the brain.

59
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:30,769
So what have you got?

60
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:55,169
- This?
- They got into a terrific argument.

61
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:02,342
- What about?
- I don't know. The traffic was loud.

62
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:06,346
I heard one thing though:
"Apple core".

63
00:14:06,555 --> 00:14:09,600
- Apple core?
- Yeah.

64
00:14:11,935 --> 00:14:17,941
- Is that what you spent the day doing?
- You said to take pictures, so I did.

65
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:22,654
Let me explain
something to you, Walsh.

66
00:14:22,863 --> 00:14:27,284
This business requires
a certain amount of finesse.

67
00:14:29,328 --> 00:14:33,332
- What is it, Sophie?
- Duffy's on the phone.

68
00:14:37,169 --> 00:14:41,840
- Duff, where are you?
- The buzzard's got a cute little twist.

69
00:14:42,049 --> 00:14:48,096
- Slow down. Where are you?
- They're in Echo Park, in a rowboat!

70
00:14:48,305 --> 00:14:51,016
Okay...

71
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:55,312
Echo Park. Water again.

72
00:15:08,242 --> 00:15:12,538
Okay, pal,
let's have us a big smile.

73
00:15:19,169 --> 00:15:21,588
You'll love it.

74
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:31,825
When you get this much publicity,
you're practically a movie star.

75
00:16:36,914 --> 00:16:41,752
- Look at that, Barn.
- Yeah, the heat's murder.

76
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:45,506
Fools' names and fools' faces.

77
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:53,555
- What's that, pal?
- You've got some way to make a living.

78
00:16:53,764 --> 00:16:59,353
- What do you do to make ends meet?
- Mortgages. First National Bank.

79
00:16:59,561 --> 00:17:03,607
Did you foreclose
on many families this week?

80
00:17:03,815 --> 00:17:07,778
- We don't publish records in the paper.
- Neither do I.

81
00:17:07,986 --> 00:17:12,991
- No, you have your press agent do it.
- Is this bimbo a regular customer?

82
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:17,496
I make an honest living. I help people
when they're in a desperate situation.

83
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:22,626
I don't kick families out of their houses
like you bums at the bank do.

84
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:27,464
Maybe you'd like to go outside
and discuss it. What do you think?

85
00:17:27,673 --> 00:17:33,637
- Let me tell you about the guy...
- I don't know how it got in the paper.

86
00:17:33,846 --> 00:17:37,516
- I make an honest living.
- Of course you do.

87
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:42,187
Anyway, this guy got tired
of screwing his wife.

88
00:17:42,396 --> 00:17:48,026
So his friend says he should do
what the Chinese do...

89
00:17:49,486 --> 00:17:55,409
Duffy. Hey, Walsh! Sophie,
go to the little girls' room for a minute.

90
00:17:55,617 --> 00:18:00,539
But Mr Gittes...
Yes, Mr Gittes.

91
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:07,212
I want to tell you a story. There's a
guy who's tired of screwing his wife...

92
00:18:07,421 --> 00:18:10,841
- Jake, there's a problem.
- Wait a second.

93
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:16,221
His friend says to do it like the Chinese
do it. "How do the Chinese do it?"

94
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:21,894
"Well, first they screw a little bit,
then they read a little Confucius, -

95
00:18:22,102 --> 00:18:26,023
- come back, screw a little bit more,
then they stop again..."

96
00:18:26,231 --> 00:18:30,736
- Jake!
- Walsh, just listen, you'll love this.

97
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:34,448
"They go back
and they screw a little bit more, -

98
00:18:34,656 --> 00:18:38,911
- and then they contemplate the moon.
It makes it more exciting."

99
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:43,332
So now the guy goes home
and starts screwing his own wife.

100
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:48,879
So he screws her a little, then goes out
of the room and reads Life magazine.

101
00:18:49,087 --> 00:18:54,259
He goes back in and screws her a bit,
then goes out and smokes a cigarette.

102
00:18:54,468 --> 00:19:00,849
His wife is sore. So the next time he's
going out to look at the moon she says:

103
00:19:01,058 --> 00:19:06,271
"Hey, what's the matter with you?
You're screwing just like a Chinaman!"

104
00:19:07,189 --> 00:19:10,609
Jesus, that Barney...

105
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:19,743
- Mr Gittes?
- Yes.

106
00:19:20,786 --> 00:19:23,664
Do you know me?

107
00:19:23,872 --> 00:19:28,502
Well... I think
I would have remembered.

108
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:34,591
- Have we ever met?
- Well, no.

109
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,553
- Never?
- Never.

110
00:19:37,761 --> 00:19:42,808
That's what I thought. I'm Mrs Evelyn
Mulwray. Mr Mulwray's wife.

111
00:19:45,102 --> 00:19:48,272
Not that Mulwray?

112
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,400
Yes, Mr Gittes. That Mulwray.

113
00:19:51,608 --> 00:19:55,571
And since you agree
that we've never met before, -

114
00:19:55,779 --> 00:20:01,243
- you must also agree that I never
hired you to spy on my husband.

115
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:05,164
I see you like publicity, Mr Gittes.

116
00:20:05,372 --> 00:20:08,500
Well, you're going to get it.

117
00:20:08,709 --> 00:20:14,089
There's been some misunderstanding.
There's no need to get tough with me...

118
00:20:14,298 --> 00:20:18,760
I don't get tough with anyone.
My lawyer does.

119
00:20:20,637 --> 00:20:24,224
Here's something for you, Mr Gittes.

120
00:20:25,976 --> 00:20:30,272
I suppose we'll be hearing
from your attorney.

121
00:20:44,703 --> 00:20:48,373
- Mr Mulwray?
- He's not in, Mr...?

122
00:20:48,582 --> 00:20:52,711
- May I ask what it's regarding?
- It's personal. Has he been gone long?

123
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:56,715
- Since lunch.
- Gee whiz, and I'm late.

124
00:20:56,924 --> 00:21:02,346
- He was expecting you?
- 15 minutes ago. I'll go in and wait.

125
00:21:02,596 --> 00:21:05,015
Sir!

126
00:22:37,191 --> 00:22:41,153
Could I help you?
Russ Yelburton, deputy chief.

127
00:22:41,361 --> 00:22:45,491
J.J. Gittes.
It's not a departmental matter.

128
00:22:45,699 --> 00:22:49,453
- Would you care to wait in my office?
- Certainly.

129
00:22:49,661 --> 00:22:53,457
We're a bit nervous,
with all this business in the papers -

130
00:22:53,665 --> 00:22:57,628
- about Mr Mulwray.
Right this way.

131
00:23:02,674 --> 00:23:06,803
After you've worked with a man
for a certain length of time, -

132
00:23:07,012 --> 00:23:10,933
- you come to know
his habits and values.

133
00:23:11,141 --> 00:23:15,812
Either he's the kind who chases
after women, or he isn't.

134
00:23:16,021 --> 00:23:21,527
- Mulwray never even kids about it.
- Maybe he takes it very seriously.

135
00:23:23,362 --> 00:23:26,573
- Sit down.
- No, thank you.

136
00:23:26,782 --> 00:23:31,286
- Where is he having lunch?
- I'm sorry, I don't know.

137
00:23:31,495 --> 00:23:36,542
- Well, tell him I'll be back.
- I will.

138
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:42,047
Do you mind if I take one of your cards,
in case I have to get in touch with you?

139
00:23:47,845 --> 00:23:52,307
- Mulvihill, what are you doing here?
- They shut my water off. So what?

140
00:23:52,516 --> 00:23:57,813
How'd you find out? You don't drink it,
you don't take a bath in it...

141
00:23:58,021 --> 00:24:03,193
They wrote you a letter... But then
you'd have to be able to read.

142
00:24:04,152 --> 00:24:06,780
Relax, glad to see you.

143
00:24:06,989 --> 00:24:11,201
- Do you know Claude Mulvihill?
- I hope so, he's working for us.

144
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:15,747
- Doing what?
- There's been threats to the reservoirs.

145
00:24:15,956 --> 00:24:21,336
- Any particular reason?
- Rationing. The farmers are desperate.

146
00:24:21,545 --> 00:24:26,300
- But the city needs drinking water.
- Well, you're in luck.

147
00:24:26,508 --> 00:24:32,472
When he was sheriff, the rum runners
landed tons of booze on the beach -

148
00:24:32,681 --> 00:24:38,228
- and never lost a drop. He ought to be
able to hold on to your water for you.

149
00:25:38,872 --> 00:25:42,167
J.J. Gittes to see Mr Mulwray.

150
00:26:05,357 --> 00:26:07,401
Please.

151
00:26:22,249 --> 00:26:24,710
You wait.

152
00:27:24,978 --> 00:27:29,399
- Bad for glass.
- Yeah, sure.

153
00:27:29,608 --> 00:27:32,569
Bad for the glass.

154
00:28:08,146 --> 00:28:13,068
- Mr Gittes.
- Actually, I came to see your husband.

155
00:28:15,779 --> 00:28:18,866
- Something to drink?
- What are you having?

156
00:28:19,074 --> 00:28:23,453
- Iced tea.
- That'll be fine, thank you.

157
00:28:26,123 --> 00:28:29,459
My husband's at the office.

158
00:28:29,668 --> 00:28:34,631
Actually, he's not. And he's checked
out of his apartment at the El Macondo.

159
00:28:34,882 --> 00:28:37,384
That's not his apartment.

160
00:28:38,886 --> 00:28:44,224
Anyway, the point is,
I'm not in business to be loved, -

161
00:28:44,433 --> 00:28:48,937
- but I am in business. Whoever
set your husband up, set me up.

162
00:28:49,146 --> 00:28:54,193
L.A. Is a small town. People talk.
I don't want to become a local joke.

163
00:28:54,401 --> 00:28:58,238
You've talked me into it.
I'll drop the lawsuit.

164
00:28:58,447 --> 00:29:02,826
- What?
- Let's just drop the whole thing.

165
00:29:03,035 --> 00:29:08,624
- Sugar, lemon, or both?
- Both... I don't want to drop it.

166
00:29:10,209 --> 00:29:12,586
I better talk to your husband.

167
00:29:12,794 --> 00:29:18,050
Why? Hollis seems to think
you're an innocent man.

168
00:29:18,258 --> 00:29:23,305
I've been accused of a lot of things,
but never that.

169
00:29:23,514 --> 00:29:27,684
Someone's gone to a lot of trouble,
and I intend to find out.

170
00:29:27,893 --> 00:29:31,271
I'm not supposed to be the one
caught with his pants down.

171
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:35,901
Unless it's a problem,
I'd like to talk to your husband.

172
00:29:36,109 --> 00:29:40,948
- May I speak frankly, Mrs Mulwray?
- You may if you can, Mr Gittes.

173
00:29:41,156 --> 00:29:45,994
That little girlfriend. She was pretty,
in a cheap sort of way, of course...

174
00:29:46,203 --> 00:29:49,164
She's disappeared.
Maybe they disappeared together.

175
00:29:49,373 --> 00:29:54,378
- If they did, how does that affect you?
- It's nothing personal.

176
00:29:54,586 --> 00:29:59,007
It's very personal.
It couldn't be more personal.

177
00:29:59,216 --> 00:30:03,262
- Is this an obsession with you?
- Let's look at it this way...

178
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:08,433
This phoney broad, excuse
the language, tells me she's you.

179
00:30:08,642 --> 00:30:13,480
Whoever put her up to it isn't after me,
they're out to get your husband.

180
00:30:13,689 --> 00:30:17,359
If I can see him, I can help him.

181
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:23,866
- Did you talk to him this morning?
- No.

182
00:30:24,074 --> 00:30:26,827
I went riding rather early.

183
00:30:27,035 --> 00:30:31,874
- It looks like you went quite a distance.
- I was riding bareback.

184
00:30:32,082 --> 00:30:36,837
You might try the Oak Pass
or the Stone Canyon Reservoir.

185
00:30:37,045 --> 00:30:40,507
He often takes walks.
Otherwise he'll be home by 6:30.

186
00:30:40,674 --> 00:30:44,094
- I'll stop by.
- Please call first.

187
00:31:00,569 --> 00:31:03,030
Sorry, closed to public.

188
00:31:03,238 --> 00:31:06,742
That's all right, officer...

189
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:10,621
Russ Yelburton,
Deputy Chief of the department.

190
00:31:10,829 --> 00:31:14,500
Sorry, Mr Yelburton.
Go on down.

191
00:31:39,233 --> 00:31:44,530
- Gittes, get out before he sees you.
- Loach, what's going on?

192
00:31:48,158 --> 00:31:52,412
- Hello, Jake.
- Lou. How are you?

193
00:31:52,621 --> 00:31:58,168
Lousy cold I can't seem to shake,
but otherwise I'm okay.

194
00:31:58,377 --> 00:32:02,464
- Summer colds are the worst.
- Yeah, they are.

195
00:32:02,673 --> 00:32:07,010
- There's no smoking here.
- We'll make an exception this time.

196
00:32:07,219 --> 00:32:12,182
I'll see he's careful with the matches
and doesn't burn himself.

197
00:32:12,391 --> 00:32:15,310
How'd you get past the guard?

198
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:19,231
To tell you the truth, I lied a little.

199
00:32:19,439 --> 00:32:23,360
- You look like you've done well.
- I get by.

200
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:28,073
Sometimes it takes a man a while
to find himself. Maybe you have.

201
00:32:28,282 --> 00:32:32,661
Yeah, going through
other people's dirty linen.

202
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:38,000
Tell me, you still putting Chinamen
in jail for spitting in the laundry?

203
00:32:38,208 --> 00:32:42,754
You're a little behind the times.
They use steam irons now.

204
00:32:42,963 --> 00:32:45,716
And I'm out of Chinatown.

205
00:32:45,924 --> 00:32:50,470
- Since when?
- Since I made lieutenant.

206
00:32:50,679 --> 00:32:53,348
Congratulations.

207
00:32:53,557 --> 00:32:58,604
- What are you doing around here?
- I'm looking for somebody.

208
00:32:58,812 --> 00:33:02,900
- Hollis Mulwray. You seen him?
- Yeah.

209
00:33:03,108 --> 00:33:07,863
- I'd like to talk to him.
- You'd like to talk to him...

210
00:33:09,823 --> 00:33:15,078
You're welcome to try.
There he is.

211
00:33:32,804 --> 00:33:37,392
It looks like he was washed down
the entire length of the run-off channel.

212
00:33:37,601 --> 00:33:40,687
- Could he swim?
- Of course.

213
00:33:40,896 --> 00:33:46,193
Obviously, the fall must have
knocked him unconscious.

214
00:33:46,401 --> 00:33:52,115
Mrs Mulwray, this alleged affair
your husband was having...

215
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:58,580
The publicity didn't make him
morose or unhappy?

216
00:33:59,748 --> 00:34:02,459
It didn't make him happy.

217
00:34:02,668 --> 00:34:06,713
- He couldn't have taken his own life?
- No.

218
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:14,263
Do you happen to know the name
of the young lady in question?

219
00:34:15,681 --> 00:34:19,226
- No.
- Or where she might be?

220
00:34:19,434 --> 00:34:23,730
You and your husband
never discussed her?

221
00:34:25,691 --> 00:34:30,612
We did.
He wouldn't tell me her name.

222
00:34:30,821 --> 00:34:35,242
We quarrelled over her, of course.
It came as a complete surprise to me.

223
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:40,205
A complete surprise? I thought
you hired a private investigator.

224
00:34:40,414 --> 00:34:43,792
A private investigator?

225
00:34:44,001 --> 00:34:46,712
Mr Gittes.

226
00:34:51,216 --> 00:34:57,556
Yes, but I did that to put an end to
a ridiculous rumour that had no basis.

227
00:35:00,934 --> 00:35:05,856
When did Mr Gittes inform you that the
rumours had some foundation in fact?

228
00:35:06,064 --> 00:35:09,276
Just before the story broke
in the papers.

229
00:35:09,484 --> 00:35:14,490
You wouldn't happen to know where
I could find her... or her name?

230
00:35:14,698 --> 00:35:17,910
- No.
- Of course not.

231
00:35:18,118 --> 00:35:22,414
- Will you need me for anything else?
- No, I don't think so.

232
00:35:22,623 --> 00:35:26,585
If we need any more information
we'll be in touch.

233
00:35:26,793 --> 00:35:30,506
Of course you have
my deepest sympathy.

234
00:35:30,714 --> 00:35:34,968
I'll see her to the car, Lou.
I'll be right back.

235
00:35:36,345 --> 00:35:39,598
- Jake, what's the story?
- Take it easy.

236
00:35:39,806 --> 00:35:44,770
We better do this in a hurry...
Give us a little room!

237
00:35:46,271 --> 00:35:50,734
You want a picture, guys?
Here it is. "Gittes", two T's and an E.

238
00:35:51,735 --> 00:35:55,280
Thank you for going along with me
back there.

239
00:35:55,489 --> 00:36:00,035
I just didn't want to explain anything.
I'll send you a check.

240
00:36:00,244 --> 00:36:04,873
- A check?
- To make it official that I've hired you.

241
00:36:21,056 --> 00:36:26,144
I'll have it this afternoon...
Jake, what are you doing here?

242
00:36:26,353 --> 00:36:31,149
It's my lunch hour, Morty. I thought I'd
drop by and see who'd dropped dead.

243
00:36:31,358 --> 00:36:35,487
Middle of a drought,
and the water commissioner drowns.

244
00:36:35,696 --> 00:36:39,491
- Only in L.A.
- Looks pretty banged up.

245
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:42,744
Well, it's a long fall.

246
00:36:46,957 --> 00:36:49,918
So how are you doing, Morty?

247
00:36:50,127 --> 00:36:53,172
Never better, except for this cough.

248
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:56,842
- You know me, Jake.
- Yeah.

249
00:37:03,557 --> 00:37:08,604
- So who have you got there?
- Leroy Shuhardt. Local drunk.

250
00:37:08,812 --> 00:37:13,233
Used to hang around Ferguson's Alley.

251
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:18,864
Quite a character. Lately he's been
living in a downtown storm drain.

252
00:37:20,741 --> 00:37:25,496
Had a bureau dresser down there
and everything.

253
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:35,714
He drowned too.

254
00:37:35,923 --> 00:37:40,344
- Come again?
- Got drunk. Passed out in the riverbed.

255
00:37:40,552 --> 00:37:45,516
- The L.A. River?
- Yeah, what's wrong with that?

256
00:37:45,724 --> 00:37:50,521
- It's dry as a bone.
- It's not completely dry.

257
00:37:50,729 --> 00:37:55,818
He ain't gonna drown in a damp
riverbed, no matter how soused he is.

258
00:37:56,026 --> 00:37:59,029
We got water out of him. He drowned.

259
00:38:56,712 --> 00:38:58,881
Hello.

260
00:39:05,554 --> 00:39:10,976
Howdy. You were riding out here
the other day, weren't you?

261
00:39:12,644 --> 00:39:17,316
- Do you speak English? Habla Ingles?
- Si.

262
00:39:17,524 --> 00:39:22,488
You were talking to a man
a few days ago. He wore glasses...

263
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:28,994
- What did you talk about?
- The water.

264
00:39:29,203 --> 00:39:33,540
- What about the water?
- When it comes.

265
00:39:33,749 --> 00:39:38,253
- What did you tell him?
- It comes in different parts of the river.

266
00:39:38,462 --> 00:39:41,798
Every night a different part.

267
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:06,693
Son of a bitch.
Goddam Florsheim shoe.

268
00:42:13,951 --> 00:42:16,578
Hold it there, kitty cat.

269
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:27,464
Hello, Claude.
Where'd you get the midget?

270
00:42:31,218 --> 00:42:35,264
You're a very nosy fellow.
Know what happens to nosy fellows?

271
00:42:35,472 --> 00:42:39,184
No? Wanna guess?

272
00:42:39,393 --> 00:42:43,021
No? Okay.
They lose their noses.

273
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:49,820
Next time you lose the whole thing.

274
00:42:50,028 --> 00:42:55,075
I'll cut it off
and feed it to my goldfish. Understand?

275
00:42:55,951 --> 00:42:59,413
- Understand?
- I understand.

276
00:43:11,717 --> 00:43:16,638
So a contractor wants to build a dam
and makes a few pay-offs. So what?

277
00:43:16,847 --> 00:43:20,142
You can't nail Mulvihill.
They'll claim you were trespassing.

278
00:43:20,350 --> 00:43:24,938
I don't want Mulvihill. I want the
big boys that are making the pay-offs.

279
00:43:25,147 --> 00:43:29,985
- Then what'll you do?
- Sue the shit out of them.

280
00:43:31,987 --> 00:43:35,532
- What is it, Sophie?
- A Miss Sessions is calling.

281
00:43:35,782 --> 00:43:39,119
- Who?
- Ida Sessions.

282
00:43:39,328 --> 00:43:42,289
Don't know her. Take a number.

283
00:43:42,498 --> 00:43:48,462
People like that will be having dinner
with the judge who's trying the suit.

284
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:51,924
I'm sorry. Miss Sessions insists.

285
00:43:52,132 --> 00:43:55,469
- She says you know her.
- Okay.

286
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:03,435
Hello, Miss Sessions.
I don't believe we've had the pleasure.

287
00:44:03,644 --> 00:44:08,482
- Oh yes we have. Are you alone?
- Isn't everyone?

288
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:11,944
What can I do for you?

289
00:44:12,152 --> 00:44:16,698
Well, I'm a working girl. I didn't
come in to see you on my own.

290
00:44:16,907 --> 00:44:21,870
- When did you come in?
- I pretended to be Mrs Mulwray.

291
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:26,416
Shut the fuck up...
Yes, I remember.

292
00:44:26,625 --> 00:44:32,047
- Is something wrong?
- I was just checking with an associate.

293
00:44:32,256 --> 00:44:37,886
- Go on.
- I never expected all this to happen.

294
00:44:38,095 --> 00:44:43,308
If it gets out, I want someone to know
that I didn't know what would happen.

295
00:44:43,517 --> 00:44:48,647
I understand. Who was your employer?
It would be helpful to both of us.

296
00:44:48,856 --> 00:44:51,483
Oh, no. No.

297
00:44:52,484 --> 00:44:55,821
What's your address?
Maybe we could talk this over.

298
00:44:56,029 --> 00:45:01,243
Just look in the obituary column
of today's L.A. Post-Record.

299
00:45:01,451 --> 00:45:05,706
You'll find one of those people.

300
00:45:07,666 --> 00:45:10,836
Sure...
How do you like them apples?

301
00:45:49,041 --> 00:45:52,628
Thank you for coming.

302
00:45:58,342 --> 00:46:01,053
- Yes, sir?
- Drink?

303
00:46:01,261 --> 00:46:04,890
Tom Collins with lime, not lemon.

304
00:46:08,936 --> 00:46:12,898
I got your check in the mail.

305
00:46:13,106 --> 00:46:18,570
- As I said, I was very grateful.
- I'm afraid that's not good enough.

306
00:46:22,866 --> 00:46:27,996
- How much would you like?
- Oh, stop it. The money's fine.

307
00:46:28,205 --> 00:46:34,503
But I think you short-changed me
on the story.

308
00:46:34,711 --> 00:46:39,550
Something else besides the death
of your husband was bothering you.

309
00:46:39,758 --> 00:46:45,222
- You were upset, but not that upset.
- Don't tell me how I feel.

310
00:46:48,517 --> 00:46:51,228
Sorry.

311
00:46:51,436 --> 00:46:55,983
You sue me, your husband dies,
you drop the lawsuit like a hot potato.

312
00:46:56,191 --> 00:47:01,822
All of it quicker than the wind
from a duck's ass. Excuse me...

313
00:47:02,030 --> 00:47:06,618
- Then you ask me to lie to the police.
- It wasn't much of a lie.

314
00:47:06,827 --> 00:47:12,374
If he was killed, it was. This could look
like a pay-off to withhold evidence.

315
00:47:12,583 --> 00:47:15,544
But he wasn't killed.

316
00:47:17,421 --> 00:47:20,757
Mrs Mulwray,
I think you're hiding something.

317
00:47:28,599 --> 00:47:33,437
I suppose I am.
Actually, I knew about the affair.

318
00:47:34,938 --> 00:47:38,025
- How did you find out?
- My husband.

319
00:47:38,233 --> 00:47:42,988
He told you? And you weren't
in the least bit upset?

320
00:47:43,197 --> 00:47:46,325
I was grateful.

321
00:47:46,533 --> 00:47:50,787
- You'll have to explain that.
- Why?

322
00:47:50,996 --> 00:47:55,834
When a wife tells me she's happy
that her husband is cheating on her, -

323
00:47:56,043 --> 00:47:59,671
- it runs contrary to my experience.

324
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:05,385
- Unless what?
- She was cheating on him.

325
00:48:08,388 --> 00:48:10,807
Were you?

326
00:48:14,895 --> 00:48:18,273
I dislike the word "cheat".

327
00:48:18,482 --> 00:48:23,195
Did you have affairs?
Did he know about it?

328
00:48:24,279 --> 00:48:29,451
I wouldn't run home and tell him
whenever I'd been to bed with another.

329
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:35,040
- Anything else you want to know?
- Where were you when Hollis died?

330
00:48:35,249 --> 00:48:38,585
- I can't tell you.
- You don't know?

331
00:48:38,794 --> 00:48:42,047
- I can't tell you.
- You were seeing someone too.

332
00:48:43,799 --> 00:48:48,887
- For very long?
- I don't see anyone for very long.

333
00:48:49,096 --> 00:48:52,474
It's difficult for me.

334
00:48:54,101 --> 00:48:59,606
Now, I think you know
all you need know about me.

335
00:48:59,815 --> 00:49:05,195
I didn't want publicity. I didn't want to
go into all of this then, or now.

336
00:49:05,404 --> 00:49:08,532
Is that all?

337
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:14,580
Oh, by the way...
What does this "C" stand for?

338
00:49:16,456 --> 00:49:19,334
Cross.

339
00:49:19,543 --> 00:49:23,839
- That's your maiden name?
- Yes. Why?

340
00:49:24,047 --> 00:49:26,133
No reason.

341
00:49:26,341 --> 00:49:30,554
- You must have had a reason to ask.
- No, I'm just a snoop.

342
00:49:35,684 --> 00:49:39,480
No, I have my own car. The Packard.

343
00:49:39,688 --> 00:49:45,194
Wait a minute, sonny.
I think you better come with me.

344
00:49:45,402 --> 00:49:49,740
There's nothing more to say.
Get my car, please.

345
00:49:51,408 --> 00:49:56,413
Okay, but in case you're interested,
your husband was murdered.

346
00:49:56,622 --> 00:50:00,459
Someone's been dumping thousands
of tons of water from the reservoirs, -

347
00:50:00,667 --> 00:50:05,547
- and we're supposedly in a drought.
He found out about it and he was killed.

348
00:50:05,756 --> 00:50:11,261
There's a drowned drunk. Involuntary
manslaughter, if anyone took the time.

349
00:50:11,512 --> 00:50:16,517
It seems like half the city is trying
to cover it up, which is fine by me, -

350
00:50:16,725 --> 00:50:20,771
- but I goddam near lost my nose.

351
00:50:21,021 --> 00:50:24,274
And I like it.
I like breathing through it.

352
00:50:24,483 --> 00:50:28,904
And I still think
that you're hiding something.

353
00:50:36,286 --> 00:50:38,664
Mr Gittes...

354
00:50:47,548 --> 00:50:51,343
J.J. Gittes to see Mr Yelburton.

355
00:51:20,622 --> 00:51:23,876
Mr Yelburton will be busy
for some time.

356
00:51:24,084 --> 00:51:27,838
Well, it's my lunch hour. I can wait.

357
00:51:28,046 --> 00:51:31,383
He's liable to be tied up indefinitely.

358
00:51:31,592 --> 00:51:36,555
I take a long lunch hour.
All day, sometimes.

359
00:52:37,282 --> 00:52:42,120
- Noah Cross worked for the company?
- Yes... No.

360
00:52:42,329 --> 00:52:46,834
- Did he or didn't he?
- He owned it.

361
00:52:47,042 --> 00:52:51,463
- He owned the water department?
- Yes.

362
00:52:51,672 --> 00:52:57,719
You mean, he owned
the entire water supply for the city?

363
00:53:02,432 --> 00:53:07,938
- How'd they get it away from him?
- Mulwray felt the public should own it.

364
00:53:08,147 --> 00:53:12,776
Mr Mulwray?
I thought you said Cross owned it.

365
00:53:12,985 --> 00:53:16,405
Along with Mr Mulwray.

366
00:53:16,613 --> 00:53:21,618
- They were partners?
- Yes, they were partners.

367
00:53:58,113 --> 00:54:01,658
Mr Yelburton will see you now.

368
00:54:05,496 --> 00:54:11,001
Mr Gittes, sorry to keep you waiting.
These staff meetings just go on and on.

369
00:54:11,210 --> 00:54:16,215
It must be especially tough to take over
under these circumstances.

370
00:54:16,423 --> 00:54:21,053
Yes, Hollis was the best
department chief the city ever had.

371
00:54:21,261 --> 00:54:26,308
- What happened to your nose?
- Cut myself shaving.

372
00:54:26,517 --> 00:54:31,230
- That must really smart.
- Only when I breathe.

373
00:54:35,567 --> 00:54:41,031
Only when you breathe... Don't tell me
you're still working for Mrs Mulwray?

374
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:44,159
- I never was.
- I don't understand.

375
00:54:44,368 --> 00:54:48,080
Neither do I, actually.
You hired me.

376
00:54:48,288 --> 00:54:52,167
Or you hired that chippie to hire me.

377
00:54:52,376 --> 00:54:58,590
- You're not making a bit of sense.
- Let's look at it this way:

378
00:54:58,799 --> 00:55:03,554
Mulwray didn't want to build a dam.
His reputation was hard to get around.

379
00:55:03,762 --> 00:55:08,934
You decided to ruin it. Then he found
out you were dumping water at night.

380
00:55:09,142 --> 00:55:12,396
Then he was... drowned.

381
00:55:12,604 --> 00:55:18,152
That's an outrageous accusation.
I don't know what you're talking about.

382
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:22,739
Well, Whitey Mehrholtz
over at the Times will.

383
00:55:22,948 --> 00:55:28,662
Dumping thousands of gallons of water
in the middle of a drought is news.

384
00:55:30,205 --> 00:55:32,666
Mr Gittes...

385
00:55:32,875 --> 00:55:38,338
We're not anxious for it to get around,
but we have been diverting water -

386
00:55:38,547 --> 00:55:41,925
- to irrigate orange groves
in the Northwest Valley.

387
00:55:42,134 --> 00:55:47,973
They have no legal right to our water,
but we've been trying to help them out.

388
00:55:48,182 --> 00:55:51,435
When you divert water,
there's a little run-off.

389
00:55:52,227 --> 00:55:57,065
Yeah, a little run-off...
Where did you say those groves were?

390
00:55:57,274 --> 00:56:02,029
- In the Northwest Valley.
- That's like saying they're in Arizona.

391
00:56:02,237 --> 00:56:07,075
My field men are out,
I can't give you the exact location.

392
00:56:07,284 --> 00:56:13,332
You're a married man, aren't you?
Hard working, wife, kids...?

393
00:56:13,540 --> 00:56:17,920
- Yes.
- I don't want to nail you.

394
00:56:22,132 --> 00:56:27,221
I want to find out who put you up to it.
I'll give you a few days to think on it.

395
00:56:27,429 --> 00:56:32,392
Call me, I can help. Who knows,
maybe we can put the whole thing off -

396
00:56:32,601 --> 00:56:38,982
- on a few big shots, and you can stay
head of the department for 20 years.

397
00:57:20,023 --> 00:57:23,610
- Drink?
- No, thank you.

398
00:57:27,781 --> 00:57:29,825
What is your usual salary?

399
00:57:30,033 --> 00:57:34,746
$35 a day, plus 20 for my associates.

400
00:57:34,913 --> 00:57:40,586
Plus expenses,
plus a bonus if I show results.

401
00:57:43,797 --> 00:57:47,301
Whoever killed my husband,
why have they gone to all this trouble?

402
00:57:47,509 --> 00:57:53,557
Money. How they plan to make it
emptying reservoirs, I don't know.

403
00:57:53,765 --> 00:57:57,728
I'll pay your salary, plus $5,000, -

404
00:57:57,936 --> 00:58:02,399
- if you find out what happened
to Hollis, and who is involved.

405
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:12,367
Sophie, draw up one of our
standard contracts for Mrs Mulwray.

406
00:58:16,663 --> 00:58:23,295
Were you married before Mulwray and
your father sold the water department?

407
00:58:23,504 --> 00:58:27,299
Noah Cross is your father, isn't he?

408
00:58:29,343 --> 00:58:31,428
Yes, of course.

409
00:58:31,637 --> 00:58:37,810
It was sometime after. I was just out
of grade school when they did that.

410
00:58:39,853 --> 00:58:44,149
Then you married
your father's business partner.

411
00:58:45,734 --> 00:58:49,238
You've already got one going.

412
00:58:50,531 --> 00:58:54,660
Does my talking about your father
upset you?

413
00:58:54,868 --> 00:58:56,954
No...

414
00:58:57,162 --> 00:59:02,042
Yes, a little.
You see, Hollis and my fa...

415
00:59:02,251 --> 00:59:07,673
...my father
had a falling out, finally.

416
00:59:07,881 --> 00:59:13,178
- Over you or the water department?
- Why should it be over me?

417
00:59:13,387 --> 00:59:16,557
Then it was over the water department.

418
00:59:16,765 --> 00:59:23,272
Hollis felt the water should belong to
the public. I think my father disagreed.

419
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:28,861
Actually, it was over the
Van der Lip Dam. The dam that broke.

420
00:59:29,069 --> 00:59:33,615
- Hollis never forgave him for it.
- Never forgave him for what?

421
00:59:33,824 --> 00:59:39,413
For talking him into building it.
They never spoke from that time on.

422
00:59:42,708 --> 00:59:45,377
You sure about that?

423
00:59:45,586 --> 00:59:48,213
Of course I'm sure.

424
00:59:52,050 --> 00:59:54,428
Sign here.

425
00:59:54,636 --> 00:59:56,763
The copy's for you.

426
01:00:59,201 --> 01:01:04,164
Mr Gittes?
How do you do?

427
01:01:04,373 --> 01:01:09,878
- You got a nasty reputation. I like that.
- Thanks.

428
01:01:10,087 --> 01:01:16,552
You're not a bank president. In your
business it's good advertising.

429
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:21,390
- It doesn't hurt.
- It helps get a client like my daughter.

430
01:01:21,598 --> 01:01:25,519
- Probably.
- I'm surprised you still work for her.

431
01:01:25,727 --> 01:01:29,273
Unless she's suddenly come up
with another husband.

432
01:01:29,481 --> 01:01:33,569
She happens to think
the last one was murdered.

433
01:01:33,777 --> 01:01:39,283
- How did she get that idea?
- I think I gave it to her.

434
01:01:39,491 --> 01:01:44,371
I hope you don't mind. I believe
they should be served with the head.

435
01:01:44,580 --> 01:01:48,125
As long as you don't
serve the chicken that way.

436
01:01:49,042 --> 01:01:52,296
Tell me, what do the police say?

437
01:01:52,504 --> 01:01:55,591
They're calling it an accident.

438
01:01:55,799 --> 01:01:59,845
- Who's the investigating officer?
- Lt. Lou Escobar.

439
01:02:00,053 --> 01:02:02,890
- You know him?
- Oh, yeah.

440
01:02:02,889 --> 01:02:06,768
- Where from?
- We worked together, in Chinatown.

441
01:02:08,145 --> 01:02:12,942
- Would you call him a capable man?
- Very.
