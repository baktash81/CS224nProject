00:00:12,076 --> 00:00:14,211
-( tires screeching )
-( crash )

2
00:00:31,362 --> 00:00:35,199
## ASKED THAT GIRL
WHAT SHE WANTED TO BE ##

3
00:00:35,199 --> 00:00:39,136
## AND SHE SAID, BABY, CAN'T YOU SEE? ##

4
00:00:39,136 --> 00:00:42,873
## I WANNA BE THE FAMOUS,
A STAR OF THE SCREEN ##

5
00:00:42,873 --> 00:00:44,775
## BUT YOU CAN DO ##

6
00:00:44,775 --> 00:00:46,777
## SOMETHING IN BETWEEN ##

7
00:00:46,777 --> 00:00:49,413
## BABY, YOU CAN DRIVE MY CAR ##

8
00:00:50,648 --> 00:00:53,417
## YES, I'M GONNA BE A STAR ##

9
00:00:54,852 --> 00:00:57,688
## BABY, YOU CAN DRIVE MY CAR ##

10
00:00:57,688 --> 00:01:00,091
## AND BABY, I LOVE YOU ##

11
00:01:03,094 --> 00:01:07,031
## I TOLD THAT GIRL THAT
MY PROSPECTS WERE GOOD ##

12
00:01:07,031 --> 00:01:10,935
## AND SHE SAID, BABY,
IT'S UNDERSTOOD ##

13
00:01:10,935 --> 00:01:14,505
## WORKING FOR PEANUTS
IS ALL VERY FINE ##

14
00:01:14,505 --> 00:01:18,609
## BUT I CAN SHOW YOU A BETTER TIME ##

15
00:01:18,609 --> 00:01:21,345
## BABY, YOU CAN DRIVE MY CAR ##

16
00:01:22,747 --> 00:01:25,349
## YES, I'M GONNA BE A STAR ##

17
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:29,120
## BABY, YOU CAN DRIVE MY CAR ##

18
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:32,723
## AND BABY, I LOVE YOU ##

19
00:01:32,723 --> 00:01:35,392
## BEEP BEEP'M BEEP BEEP YEAH ##

20
00:01:36,827 --> 00:01:39,230
## BEEP BEEP'M BEEP BEEP YEAH ##

21
00:01:40,898 --> 00:01:43,000
## BEEP BEEP'M BEEP BEEP YEAH! ##

22
00:02:16,767 --> 00:02:19,170
( sawing metal )

23
00:03:03,881 --> 00:03:06,617
( laughing maniacally )

24
00:03:28,472 --> 00:03:30,141
( continues laughing )

25
00:03:42,086 --> 00:03:44,388
( tires squealing )

26
00:03:54,432 --> 00:03:56,467
( growling )

27
00:04:54,925 --> 00:04:59,029
Man's voice: Remember, the driver
must always see the big picture.

28
00:04:59,029 --> 00:05:01,298
When driving through
puddles or in heavy rain,

29
00:05:01,298 --> 00:05:03,601
your tires may
begin to hydroplane--

30
00:05:03,601 --> 00:05:06,137
actually ride on the water
rather than the pavement.

31
00:05:06,137 --> 00:05:08,205
If this happens to you, don't panic

32
00:05:08,205 --> 00:05:11,242
and especially don't jam on your brakes.

33
00:05:11,242 --> 00:05:13,611
In this actual scientific demonstration,

34
00:05:13,611 --> 00:05:15,946
we see that in as little
as a quarter inch of water

35
00:05:15,946 --> 00:05:19,049
your tires may lose contact
with the surface completely.

36
00:05:39,203 --> 00:05:41,372
( laughs )

37
00:05:44,408 --> 00:05:46,410
( tires screech )

38
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:48,212
( bell rings )

39
00:05:51,282 --> 00:05:53,317
DOES YOUR BROTHER
HAVE MONO OR SOMETHING?

40
00:05:53,317 --> 00:05:56,353
- HE SLEPT THROUGH THE ENTIRE COURSE.
- NO.

41
00:05:56,353 --> 00:05:58,722
HE'S JUST BRAIN-DEAD.

42
00:06:00,558 --> 00:06:03,294
MR. ANDERSON.

43
00:06:03,294 --> 00:06:06,263
IT'S PUNKS LIKE YOU THAT PARAMEDICS

44
00:06:06,263 --> 00:06:09,233
END UP SCRAPING OFF THE
ROAD AT 4:00 IN THE MORNING.

45
00:06:09,233 --> 00:06:12,303
FOR YOUR SAKE AND THE SAFETY OF OTHERS,

46
00:06:12,303 --> 00:06:15,473
I HOPE YOU FAIL YOUR DRIVING EXAM.

47
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:31,655
( engine revving )

48
00:06:31,655 --> 00:06:33,724
WAIT UP!

49
00:06:33,724 --> 00:06:35,726
WAIT UP! MY BUS!

50
00:06:45,302 --> 00:06:47,538
- ( honking )
- ( tires screech )

51
00:06:59,683 --> 00:07:02,486
YOU KNOW, DEAN, I CAN'T HELP WONDERING,

52
00:07:02,486 --> 00:07:04,722
IS IT EVER GONNA GET THAT GOOD FOR ME?

53
00:07:04,722 --> 00:07:08,659
ANDERSON, THE ONLY DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN YOU AND THAT GREASEBALL

54
00:07:08,659 --> 00:07:11,595
- IS THAT HE HAS A LICENSE, AND YOU DON'T.
- ( tires screech )

55
00:07:13,197 --> 00:07:15,332
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!

56
00:07:15,332 --> 00:07:16,967
SCUMBAG!

57
00:07:21,739 --> 00:07:23,908
GET ON IT. I'LL DRIVE YOU HOME.

58
00:07:23,908 --> 00:07:27,044
NO WAY, MAN. I HAVE A
DRIVER'S EXAM TO TAKE SATURDAY.

59
00:07:27,044 --> 00:07:28,913
- I DON'T WANT TO GET KILLED.
- LES.

60
00:07:28,913 --> 00:07:32,416
YOUR LICENSE IS JUST AS
IMPORTANT TO ME AS IT IS TO YOU.

61
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:35,619
I'LL TAKE IT EASY.

62
00:07:35,619 --> 00:07:37,221
TRUST ME.

63
00:07:37,221 --> 00:07:39,623
Dean: WHOO-HOO! YEAH!

64
00:07:39,623 --> 00:07:41,892
WATCH OUT, WATCH OUT!

65
00:07:41,892 --> 00:07:43,194
DEAN! DEAN!

66
00:07:46,397 --> 00:07:49,467
- Man: I'LL GET YOU, YOU LITTLE PRICK!
- DEAN!

67
00:07:49,467 --> 00:07:50,901
( tires screech )

68
00:08:00,911 --> 00:08:03,481
- Dean: Hee-hee-hee-hee!
- Les: Whoa!

69
00:08:07,284 --> 00:08:09,153
HERE YOU GO!

70
00:08:09,153 --> 00:08:11,255
FRONT-DOOR SERVICE!

71
00:08:11,255 --> 00:08:14,725
- GREAT. THANKS.
- WOW!

72
00:08:14,725 --> 00:08:16,460
Dean: WHOSE CADDY?

73
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:19,563
IT'S MY GRANDFATHER'S.
16 YEARS OLD, MAN,

74
00:08:19,563 --> 00:08:22,099
AND IT ONLY HAS 20,000 MILES ON IT.

75
00:08:22,099 --> 00:08:24,268
WOW!

76
00:08:24,268 --> 00:08:27,705
- WHAT'S IT DOING HERE?
- MY GRANDDAD'S AFRAID TO TAKE IT ON LONG TRIPS,

77
00:08:27,705 --> 00:08:30,007
SO HE BORROWED MY DAD'S CAR FOR A WEEK.

78
00:08:30,007 --> 00:08:33,277
DO YOU KNOW THIS BOAT WOULD KICK ASS

79
00:08:33,277 --> 00:08:35,279
UP AT ARCHIES?

80
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,115
DO YOU THINK THERE'S ANY CHANCE
WE CAN GET IT SATURDAY NIGHT?

81
00:08:38,115 --> 00:08:39,984
- NOT A CHANCE IN HELL.
- NO WAY.

82
00:08:39,984 --> 00:08:42,686
- HEY, DAD, WHAT'S UP?
- I'M JUST CLEANING OUT THE GARAGE,

83
00:08:42,686 --> 00:08:45,289
MAKING SOME ROOM FOR THE
OLD BOAT. WHAT DO YOU THINK?

84
00:08:45,289 --> 00:08:48,325
- AS LONG AS YOU'RE HERE, YOU WANT TO GIVE US A HAND?
- HEY, DEANO!

85
00:08:48,325 --> 00:08:51,328
I'D LOVE TO, MR. ANDERSON,
BUT I JUST REMEMBERED--

86
00:08:51,328 --> 00:08:53,130
( coughs )

87
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:56,467
I'M ALLERGIC TO DUST AND CARDBOARD BOXES

88
00:08:56,467 --> 00:08:59,770
( coughs ) I GOTTA GO.
SEE YOU TONIGHT, LES!

89
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:02,706
- SEE YOU TONIGHT, DEANO.
- TAKE CARE OF THAT COUGH, DEAN.

90
00:09:02,706 --> 00:09:04,775
- DAD?
- YEAH.

91
00:09:04,775 --> 00:09:06,977
DO YOU THINK THERE'S
ANY WAY YOU CAN TELL ME

92
00:09:06,977 --> 00:09:08,979
IF I CAN BORROW MOM'S
CAR SATURDAY NIGHT?

93
00:09:08,979 --> 00:09:12,383
HERE'S THE DEAL, LES. FIRST GET
YOUR LICENSE, THEN WE'LL TALK.

94
00:09:20,257 --> 00:09:21,859
Mr. Anderson: NATALIE!

95
00:09:21,859 --> 00:09:24,195
WHAT NICE HAPPENED TO WHO TODAY?

96
00:09:24,195 --> 00:09:26,397
WHAT INTERESTING NEWS?

97
00:09:26,397 --> 00:09:29,934
- ( indistinct chatter )
- ( chatting stops )

98
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,722
FOR YOUR INFORMATION,
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I ATE

99
00:09:51,722 --> 00:09:55,259
WHEN I WAS PREGNANT WITH ALL
OF YOU. YOU TURNED OUT OKAY.

100
00:09:55,259 --> 00:09:56,961
- Les: DAD?
-YEP?

101
00:09:56,961 --> 00:09:59,997
DID YOU, UM, LOOK AT
THE BROCHURE I GAVE YOU?

102
00:09:59,997 --> 00:10:02,133
-YOU BET.
- WHAT DID YOU THINK?

103
00:10:02,133 --> 00:10:05,035
WELL, A $23,000 BMW

104
00:10:05,035 --> 00:10:08,439
FOR A 16-YEAR-OLD KID WHO'S
NEVER HAD A JOB A DAY IN HIS LIFE?

105
00:10:08,439 --> 00:10:10,474
I THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA.

106
00:10:10,474 --> 00:10:12,943
BUT DAD, THE CAR
WOULDN'T ONLY BE FOR ME.

107
00:10:12,943 --> 00:10:15,446
I MEAN, SHE CAN USE IT TOO!

108
00:10:15,446 --> 00:10:17,815
DON'T INCLUDEME IN YOUR OBSESSIONS.

109
00:10:17,815 --> 00:10:20,885
LES, ISN'T IT PREMATURE TO BE
TALKING ABOUT GETTING A CAR?

110
00:10:20,885 --> 00:10:23,654
YOU JUST FINISHED YOUR DRIVER'S
ED COURSE TWO HOURS AGO.

111
00:10:23,654 --> 00:10:27,258
KARL SAYS THAT IN AMERICA,
PEOPLE ARE MISLEAD TO BELIEVE

112
00:10:27,258 --> 00:10:30,828
- THAT A CAR REPRESENTS FREEDOM
AND INDIVIDUALITY-- - RIGHT.

113
00:10:30,828 --> 00:10:35,065
WHEN IN ESSENCE, IT IS MORE
OPPRESSIVE THAN ANYTHING ELSE.

114
00:10:35,065 --> 00:10:37,902
BURDENING THE INDIVIDUAL
WITH SUCH MATERIALISTIC COST--

115
00:10:37,902 --> 00:10:41,338
WAIT, WHO CARES WHAT YOUR
COMMIE BOYFRIEND THINKS?

116
00:10:41,338 --> 00:10:44,508
- I SEE IT'S GREAT TO BE AN AMERICAN.
- I AGREE.

117
00:10:44,508 --> 00:10:46,143
YES!

118
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:48,879
THIS IS THE MOST OPPRESSIVE
ENVIRONMENT A CHILD CAN BE RAISED IN.

119
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:51,849
NATALIE, ONE DAY SOON,
IT WILL ALL BE OVER.

120
00:10:51,849 --> 00:10:54,652
- YOU'LL GO AWAY.
-( honking )

121
00:10:54,652 --> 00:10:57,188
( honks )

122
00:10:57,188 --> 00:10:59,123
ALL RIGHT, I'M OUT OF HERE.

123
00:10:59,123 --> 00:11:02,426
HEY, BUDDY, DOWN!

124
00:11:02,426 --> 00:11:04,762
( honking continues )

125
00:11:09,467 --> 00:11:12,036
Dean: YO, LET'S GO!

126
00:11:12,036 --> 00:11:15,372
-( honking continues )
-LES, COME ON, GET YOUR BUTT DOWN HERE!

127
00:11:16,474 --> 00:11:18,242
LES!

128
00:11:18,242 --> 00:11:20,611
- ( honking )
- GET DOWN HERE, LES!

129
00:11:24,315 --> 00:11:26,183
- GET OUT!
- OUT!

130
00:11:26,183 --> 00:11:28,853
RIGHT. I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

131
00:11:28,853 --> 00:11:32,456
## SWEET, SWEET SURRENDER... ##

132
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:36,927
- MOM-- - WHAT
ARE YOU DOING?

133
00:11:36,927 --> 00:11:38,629
DUCK DOWN! DUCK DOWN!

134
00:11:38,629 --> 00:11:41,632
Dean: MOM, MOM! NO, DON'T STOP HERE.

135
00:11:41,632 --> 00:11:44,435
- GO, GO!
- IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE CAR, DEAN?

136
00:11:44,435 --> 00:11:46,270
NO, IT'S NOT THE CAR, IT'S YOU.

137
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:49,473
- YOU'RE DRIVING. PLEASE, JUST GO.
- ALL RIGHT.

138
00:11:57,214 --> 00:12:01,419
- THANKS, MOM. DRIVE SAFELY.
- Boy: HEY, DWEEBS!

139
00:12:01,419 --> 00:12:04,188
DOES MOMMY HOLD YOUR
DICKS WHEN YOU PISS?

140
00:12:04,188 --> 00:12:07,625
( laughing )

141
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:10,594
SORRY, MOM, I DIDN'T INTRODUCE
YOU. THOSE ARE MY FRIENDS.

142
00:12:10,594 --> 00:12:13,731
- OH. GOOD NIGHT
- GOOD NIGHT, MOM.

143
00:12:15,733 --> 00:12:18,302
## WHEN  YOUR LIFE MEETS MINE ##

144
00:12:18,302 --> 00:12:22,406
## YOU REACH WAY DOWN INSIDE... ##

145
00:12:23,474 --> 00:12:25,009
THANKS, MOM.

146
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:27,945
GOOD NIGHT, HONEY.

147
00:12:27,945 --> 00:12:30,047
- IGNORE.
-BYE, MOM!

148
00:12:30,047 --> 00:12:31,882
- Mom: BE CAREFUL!
- HEY, GUYS!

149
00:12:31,882 --> 00:12:34,952
HEY, GUYS! WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

150
00:12:34,952 --> 00:12:38,789
GUYS! HEY, GUYS, IT'S ME, CHARLES!

151
00:12:38,789 --> 00:12:41,192
( dance music playing )

152
00:12:45,996 --> 00:12:48,833
OH, BABY!

153
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:51,902
HEY, DO YOU EVER WONDER WHAT KIND OF CAR

154
00:12:51,902 --> 00:12:54,371
SOME OF THESE BABES WOULD
LOSE THEIR VIRGINITY IN?

155
00:12:54,371 --> 00:12:57,007
YOU NEVER CEASE TO AMAZE ME, DEANO.

156
00:12:57,007 --> 00:12:59,009
NO, SERIOUSLY. OKAY,

157
00:12:59,009 --> 00:13:00,745
LOOK AT SHERYL LIEBERMAN.

158
00:13:00,745 --> 00:13:03,881
Charles: A V.W. CONVERTIBLE.

159
00:13:03,881 --> 00:13:06,951
SHERYL LIEBERMAN? TRANS AM.

160
00:13:08,452 --> 00:13:12,323
- BETH MacCLAIN.
- Les: A VOLVO. NO, WAIT.

161
00:13:12,323 --> 00:13:14,525
-A STATION WAGON.
-( all three laugh )

162
00:13:15,659 --> 00:13:18,696
OKAY, I GOT ONE FOR YOU. BONNIE DUPER.

163
00:13:18,696 --> 00:13:22,433
- Les: A CARGO VAN.
- Charles: A GARBAGE TRUCK!

164
00:13:29,507 --> 00:13:31,175
MERCEDES.

165
00:13:32,243 --> 00:13:34,345
MERCEDES LANE.

166
00:13:34,345 --> 00:13:36,614
I'VE BUMPED INTO HER A MILLION TIMES.

167
00:13:36,614 --> 00:13:38,382
SHE'S NEVER BUMPED INTO ME ONCE.

168
00:13:38,382 --> 00:13:41,085
- COME WITH ME.
- NO, LISTEN, YOU DON'T OWN ME.

169
00:13:41,085 --> 00:13:43,020
WOMEN HAVE RIGHTS IN THIS COUNTRY.

170
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:46,357
NOT LIKE KUWAIT OR PAKISTAN
WHERE THEY WORSHIP THEIR MEN.

171
00:13:46,357 --> 00:13:49,126
MERCEDES, IT HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH WORSHIP.

172
00:13:49,126 --> 00:13:51,996
IT HAS TO DO WITH GOING
TO PARTIES WITH KIDS!

173
00:13:51,996 --> 00:13:54,465
I HAPPEN TO GO TO
SCHOOL WITH THESE KIDS.

174
00:13:54,465 --> 00:13:57,234
- I HAVE FRIENDS HERE.
- FRIENDS, YES. FRIENDS, OKAY.

175
00:13:57,234 --> 00:14:00,538
BUT THESE ARE CHILDREN.
THEY CAN DO NOTHING FOR YOU.

176
00:14:00,538 --> 00:14:03,941
MERCEDES, I'M BEGINNING TO...

177
00:14:05,609 --> 00:14:07,111
PERSPIRE.

178
00:14:07,111 --> 00:14:09,213
YOU KNOW THAT I HATE TO PERSPIRE.

179
00:14:09,213 --> 00:14:10,614
NOW LET US GO.

180
00:14:10,614 --> 00:14:12,917
I THINK I CAN FIND MY OWN WAY HOME,

181
00:14:12,917 --> 00:14:15,419
-THANK YOU.
- DON'T DO THIS, MERCEDES.

182
00:14:15,419 --> 00:14:18,022
AND PAOLO, IF YOU'RE
WONDERING ABOUT SATURDAY NIGHT,

183
00:14:18,022 --> 00:14:20,424
I JUST REMEMBERED I ALREADY HAVE A DATE.

184
00:14:20,424 --> 00:14:23,394
YOU HAVE A DATE? WITH WHO?

185
00:14:25,863 --> 00:14:28,733
- WITH HIM.
- WITH ME?

186
00:14:28,733 --> 00:14:30,568
DIDN'T WE MAKE ARRANGEMENTS?

187
00:14:30,568 --> 00:14:33,537
YEAH, I-- I
BELIEVE SO.

188
00:14:33,537 --> 00:14:36,774
BUT NOTHING WAS FINAL.

189
00:14:38,676 --> 00:14:40,578
WELL, NOW THEY'RE FINAL.

190
00:14:41,812 --> 00:14:43,314
CIAO!

191
00:14:45,516 --> 00:14:47,551
HEY, WATCH IT!

192
00:14:48,953 --> 00:14:50,521
THANKS.

193
00:14:59,163 --> 00:15:01,298
LES, I HAVE THE ANSWER.

194
00:15:01,298 --> 00:15:03,434
WHAT DON'T YOU JUST
ASK HER, TO MAKE SURE?

195
00:15:03,434 --> 00:15:07,037
I'D LOVE TO, CHARLES, BUT I CAN'T
TALK TO SOMETHING I CAN'T SEE, RIGHT?

196
00:15:07,037 --> 00:15:09,807
LAST NIGHT WAS THE CLOSEST ANY
OF US HAVE EVER BEEN TO HER.

197
00:15:09,807 --> 00:15:11,409
WELL, YOU'RE IN LUCK, LOVERBOY,

198
00:15:11,409 --> 00:15:13,611
'CAUSE SHE'S SITTING
DOWN RIGHT OVER THERE.

199
00:15:18,115 --> 00:15:21,485
- WAIT, WAIT, DEAN. I CAN'T DO IT, MAN!
- GO ON, ASK HER.

200
00:15:21,485 --> 00:15:24,855
IF YOU'RE LUCKY, SHE'LL BITE. ( laughs )

201
00:15:31,695 --> 00:15:33,998
Dean: GO FOR IT!

202
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,737
-( honking )
- LES!

203
00:15:39,737 --> 00:15:41,072
LES.

204
00:15:42,506 --> 00:15:44,308
LES?

205
00:15:47,445 --> 00:15:49,880
LES, IT'S ME, PAPA!

206
00:15:51,382 --> 00:15:54,118
- LES, WAIT UP!
- ( honks )

207
00:15:54,118 --> 00:15:56,754
WHERE ARE YOU GOING? LES?

208
00:15:58,389 --> 00:16:01,692
WHAT'S THE MATTER? IS THERE
SOMETHING WRONG WITH HAVING A FATHER?

209
00:16:01,692 --> 00:16:04,361
DAD, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

210
00:16:04,361 --> 00:16:06,697
I HAD TO RUN SOME ERRANDS
FOR YOUR MOM AFTER WORK

211
00:16:06,697 --> 00:16:08,933
AND I THOUGHT I'D STOP
BY AND TAKE YOU DRIVING.

212
00:16:08,933 --> 00:16:12,269
I FIGURE, IF YOU CAN HANDLE THIS
CRUISER YOU CAN HANDLE ANYTHING.

213
00:16:12,269 --> 00:16:15,106
- WHAT ABOUT GRANDPA?
- WHAT ABOUT GRANDPA?

214
00:16:15,106 --> 00:16:18,509
- WHO KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING WITHMYCAR. GET IN.
- YEAH!

215
00:16:19,977 --> 00:16:22,947
- DAD, HERE COMES A STOP SIGN.
- NICE CALL.

216
00:16:22,947 --> 00:16:25,249
( radio playing )

217
00:16:25,249 --> 00:16:27,351
THAT WAS A GOOD ONE.

218
00:16:28,652 --> 00:16:30,621
WHY DON'T WE MAKE A
RIGHT TURN RIGHT HERE?

219
00:16:31,856 --> 00:16:33,858
- WHAT?
- I HAVE TO ASK YOU A FAVOR,

220
00:16:33,858 --> 00:16:35,659
AND YOU COULD SAY NO.

221
00:16:35,659 --> 00:16:38,729
BUT I WILL NEVER, EVER ASK YOU FOR
ANOTHER FAVOR AS LONG AS I LIVE.

222
00:16:38,729 --> 00:16:42,299
LES, YOU KNOW THAT'S A LIE.

223
00:16:42,299 --> 00:16:44,802
OKAY, SEE THAT GIRL OVER THERE WALKING?

224
00:16:44,802 --> 00:16:45,970
DAD!

225
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:48,439
THAT IS THE GIRL OF MY DREAMS.

226
00:16:48,439 --> 00:16:51,242
OKAY, OKAY.

227
00:16:51,242 --> 00:16:53,077
- LET'S GIVE HER A CRUISE!
- DAD.

228
00:16:53,077 --> 00:16:56,480
DAD, SHH! LOOK,

229
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,917
- SHE JUST ASKED ME OUT LAST NIGHT, DAD.
- YEAH?

230
00:16:59,917 --> 00:17:01,986
NOW, IF I DROVE BY HER

231
00:17:01,986 --> 00:17:05,156
WITH YOU IN THE
CAR WITH ME--

232
00:17:05,156 --> 00:17:08,192
NO OFFENSE, IT JUST WOULDN'T
WORK. YOU UNDERSTAND?

233
00:17:08,192 --> 00:17:12,029
YOU'RE ASKING ME TO LET YOU DRIVE
THIS CAR ALONE WITHOUT A LICENSE.

234
00:17:12,029 --> 00:17:14,899
- ARE YOU CRAZY?!
- I'M JUST GONNA GO UP TO HER,

235
00:17:14,899 --> 00:17:18,102
CIRCLE AROUND, MAYBE SAY HELLO
TO HER AND COME RIGHT BACK.

236
00:17:18,102 --> 00:17:19,870
TWO MINUTES! I'LL BE CAREFUL, DAD.

237
00:17:21,405 --> 00:17:23,474
- SURE.
- THANKS.

238
00:17:23,474 --> 00:17:25,576
- BE CAREFUL.
- I WILL, I PROMISE.

239
00:17:25,576 --> 00:17:27,878
- I TRUST YOU.
- THANKS, DAD.

240
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:32,383
- OH AND, DAD, DAD!
-YEAH?

241
00:17:32,383 --> 00:17:34,018
WOULD YOU MIND?

242
00:17:45,563 --> 00:17:48,432
- ( honks )
- MERCEDES!

243
00:17:48,432 --> 00:17:51,469
MERCEDES? LES ANDERSON, FROM THE PARTY

244
00:17:51,469 --> 00:17:54,105
LAST NIGHT.

245
00:17:54,105 --> 00:17:56,607
OH. OH, HI!

246
00:17:56,607 --> 00:17:58,609
I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T RECOGNIZE YOU.

247
00:17:58,609 --> 00:18:00,978
HOP IN, I'LL GIVE YOU A LIFT.

248
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:03,514
SURE.

249
00:18:03,514 --> 00:18:04,982
HOLD ON!

250
00:18:11,322 --> 00:18:13,057
AFTER YOU, MADAME.

251
00:18:27,271 --> 00:18:29,940
OKAY, SO, WHICH HOUSE IS YOURS?

252
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:32,076
- THIRD ONE ON
THE LEFT. - OKAY--

253
00:18:32,076 --> 00:18:35,212
BUT, I'M NOT GOING HOME.

254
00:18:35,212 --> 00:18:37,848
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

255
00:18:37,848 --> 00:18:40,518
TO A FRIEND'S HOUSE, IN CEDARWOOD.

256
00:18:40,518 --> 00:18:42,787
YOU DON'T MIND, SO YOU?

257
00:18:50,561 --> 00:18:52,430
NOT AT ALL.

258
00:18:57,768 --> 00:18:59,570
LES?

259
00:19:00,838 --> 00:19:02,807
LES?!

260
00:19:02,807 --> 00:19:04,308
LES!

261
00:19:04,308 --> 00:19:07,445
LES!

262
00:19:07,445 --> 00:19:09,146
LES!

263
00:19:16,821 --> 00:19:19,790
- THANKS A LOT.
- WAIT, WAIT!

264
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:21,459
MERCEDES!

265
00:19:21,459 --> 00:19:25,262
LAST NIGHT AT THE PARTY,

266
00:19:25,262 --> 00:19:27,565
YOU KIND OF MENTIONED SOMETHING ABOUT

267
00:19:27,565 --> 00:19:30,267
ME AND YOU MAYBE GOING
OUT SATURDAY NIGHT.

268
00:19:30,267 --> 00:19:32,136
ANYWAY, I WAS JUST

269
00:19:32,136 --> 00:19:35,806
WONDERING IF IT WAS STILL ON.

270
00:19:35,806 --> 00:19:38,776
SURE. CALL ME TOMORROW.

271
00:19:38,776 --> 00:19:41,245
LET ME GIVE YOU MY NUMBER
IN CASE SOMETHING COMES UP.

272
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:45,783
- OH, HERE. WRITE IT ON THIS.
- GREAT.

273
00:19:47,084 --> 00:19:50,388
THANKS A LOT FOR THE RIDE, LES.

274
00:19:50,388 --> 00:19:53,157
YEAH, NO PROBLEM.

275
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:13,244
( growls )

276
00:20:16,147 --> 00:20:18,315
HOW COULD YOU DO IT, LES?

277
00:20:18,315 --> 00:20:20,451
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING ABOUT?

278
00:20:20,451 --> 00:20:22,553
I DON'T BELIEVE IT. I MEAN...

279
00:20:22,553 --> 00:20:25,923
NOT ONLY DID YOU BREAK
YOUR EXPLICIT PROMISE TO ME,

280
00:20:25,923 --> 00:20:29,627
BUT YOU USED UP YOUR LAST FAVOR.

281
00:20:29,627 --> 00:20:32,596
I SUPPOSE YOU KNOW WHERE
THIS LEAVES YOU, DON'T YOU?

282
00:20:32,596 --> 00:20:34,932
- NOT IN GOOD SHAPE?
- THAT'S RIGHT.

283
00:20:34,932 --> 00:20:37,468
LOOK, DAD, JUST LET ME
EXPLAIN IT TO YOU, OKAY?

284
00:20:37,468 --> 00:20:39,970
SHE TOLD ME SHE LIVED THREE HOUSES DOWN.

285
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:41,639
I THOUGHT I WAS TAKING HER HOME.

286
00:20:41,639 --> 00:20:43,441
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL HER THE TRUTH?

287
00:20:43,441 --> 00:20:45,409
TELL MERCEDES LANE THE TRUTH,

288
00:20:45,409 --> 00:20:48,746
- THAT LES ANDERSON DOESN'T HAVE A LICENSE?
- YES.

289
00:20:48,746 --> 00:20:51,715
AND RISK HER HAVING A HEART
ATTACK FROM LAUGHING SO HARD AT ME?

290
00:20:51,715 --> 00:20:54,051
Mr. Anderson: HER? HER
HAVING A HEART ATTACK?

291
00:20:54,051 --> 00:20:57,154
LOOK, DAD, PLEASE PUT
YOURSELF IN MY SHOES.

292
00:21:00,357 --> 00:21:02,793
LOOK, YOU'RE UPSETTING YOUR MOTHER.

293
00:21:02,793 --> 00:21:04,195
SHE'S PREGNANT, YOU KNOW?

294
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:07,531
Dean: DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENS

295
00:21:07,531 --> 00:21:09,667
IF YOU GET CAUGHT
DRIVING WITHOUT A LICENSE?

296
00:21:09,667 --> 00:21:12,470
THEY MAKE YOU WAIT TWO YEARS
BEFORE YOU CAN TAKE THE TEST AGAIN.

297
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:15,272
THAT'S 24 MONTHS. THAT'S
AN AWFUL LOT OF BUS RIDES.

298
00:21:15,272 --> 00:21:17,608
RELAX, DEANO. I DIDN'T GET CAUGHT.

299
00:21:17,608 --> 00:21:21,245
AND YOU WOULD HAVE DONE THE
EXACT SAME THING THAT I DID.

300
00:21:21,245 --> 00:21:24,248
NOW, DID YOU GUYS COME OVER HERE
TO ASK ME SOME QUESTIONS, OR WHAT?

301
00:21:25,349 --> 00:21:27,485
ALL RIGHT, HERE'S ONE:

302
00:21:27,485 --> 00:21:31,255
"HOW CAN YOU IDENTIFY A BLIND PEDESTRIAN

303
00:21:31,255 --> 00:21:33,224
TO WHOM YOU MUST YIELD
THE RIGHT OF WAY?"

304
00:21:33,224 --> 00:21:35,092
THIS IS A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME.

305
00:21:35,092 --> 00:21:37,995
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU JUST MOVED
HERE FROM BEDROCK OR SOMETHING.

306
00:21:37,995 --> 00:21:40,164
YOU'VE BEEN A PASSENGER
IN A CAR ALL YOUR LIFE.

307
00:21:40,164 --> 00:21:43,334
-( classical music plays )
- AND WHAT IS THIS SHIT?

308
00:21:46,036 --> 00:21:48,639
NATALIE!

309
00:21:48,639 --> 00:21:51,008
HEY, NATALIE, I WAS WONDERING,

310
00:21:51,008 --> 00:21:52,877
IF YOU'RE DRIVING 55 MILES PER HOUR

311
00:21:52,877 --> 00:21:54,879
AND YOU COLLIDE WITH A RUNAWAY TRAIN,

312
00:21:54,879 --> 00:21:57,748
WOULD IT MAKE
ANYIMPROVEMENTS ON YOUR FACE?

313
00:21:57,748 --> 00:22:00,751
- ( Dean laughs )
- ( burps )

314
00:22:04,021 --> 00:22:07,224
GOOD LUCK ON YOUR EXAM
TOMORROW, EINSTEIN!

315
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:12,530
GOOD AFTERNOON, CHILDREN!

316
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:16,567
IN THE NEXT 20 MINUTES, YOU
WILL BE GIVEN 30 QUESTIONS.

317
00:22:16,567 --> 00:22:18,636
ANYTHING OVER FIVE MISTAKES

318
00:22:18,636 --> 00:22:21,705
WILL BE CONSIDERED A FAILING GRADE.

319
00:22:21,705 --> 00:22:25,042
WE'LL BEGIN AT THE SOUND OF THE BELL.

320
00:22:27,378 --> 00:22:28,913
-( bell rings )
- BEGIN.

321
00:22:33,217 --> 00:22:36,520

Press start to begin.

323
00:22:38,823 --> 00:22:40,825
Question one: What should you do

324
00:22:40,825 --> 00:22:42,827
if you miss your exit
from an expressway?

325
00:22:42,827 --> 00:22:45,296
A: Jam on the breaks and back up;

326
00:22:45,296 --> 00:22:48,165

327
00:22:48,165 --> 00:22:51,769

- HA!
-Question two:

329
00:22:55,072 --> 00:22:57,475
Which is usually the
smoothest lane of traffic?

330
00:22:57,475 --> 00:23:00,678
WHY DON'T THEY JUST GIVE LICENSES AWAY?

331
00:23:00,678 --> 00:23:03,647
-Incorrect.
- WHAT?

332
00:23:09,687 --> 00:23:12,490
Question three: You must
look for bicycle riders

333
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:15,292
in the same lanes used by
motor vehicles, because they...

334
00:23:15,292 --> 00:23:17,661
A: Must ride facing oncoming traffic;

335
00:23:17,661 --> 00:23:20,097
B: Are entitled to
share the road with you;

336
00:23:20,097 --> 00:23:22,566
C: Always have the right of way.

337
00:23:27,138 --> 00:23:29,907
Incorrect.

338
00:23:29,907 --> 00:23:33,110
When driving through fog
or rain, it is advisable...

339
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:35,112
( overlapping questions )

340
00:23:45,289 --> 00:23:48,392
...C: Stop.

341
00:23:48,392 --> 00:23:50,628

342
00:23:50,628 --> 00:23:53,697
Warning, one more wrong and you fail!

343
00:23:59,003 --> 00:24:00,704
FINISHED!

344
00:24:03,207 --> 00:24:04,975
Question 26.

345
00:24:04,975 --> 00:24:08,412
At 55 miles per hour you come
upon a large puddle of water.

346
00:24:08,412 --> 00:24:11,015
Do you A: Pump the brakes;

347
00:24:11,015 --> 00:24:14,151
B: Gently ease your
foot off the gas pedal;

348
00:24:14,151 --> 00:24:16,220
C: Accelerate?

349
00:24:27,231 --> 00:24:29,900
Incorrect. You have failed!

350
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:41,712
- DAMN!
- Student: OH MAN!

351
00:24:41,712 --> 00:24:43,981
- Student £2: WHAT HAPPENED?
-I LOST MY SCREEN.

352
00:24:43,981 --> 00:24:46,016
SOMEONE PULL THE PLUG OR SOMETHING?

353
00:24:47,852 --> 00:24:50,721
MR. ANDERSON. MR. ANDERSON!

354
00:24:50,721 --> 00:24:53,090
MR. ANDERSON. OH, MR. ANDERSON.

355
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:56,494
YOU CAN THANK YOUR SISTER FOR THIS ONE.

356
00:24:56,494 --> 00:24:58,329
- I CAN?
- UH-HUH.

357
00:24:58,329 --> 00:25:00,264
DUE TO A COMPUTER MALFUNCTION,

358
00:25:00,264 --> 00:25:02,800
WE ARE UNABLE TO SEARCH
THE SYSTEM'S MEMORY

359
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,002
FOR YOUR TEST RESULTS.

360
00:25:05,002 --> 00:25:08,606
HOWEVER, SINCE YOUR SISTER
RECEIVED A PERFECT SCORE,

361
00:25:08,606 --> 00:25:10,574
WE ARE GOING TO PASS YOU

362
00:25:10,574 --> 00:25:13,577
AND ALLOW YOU TO TAKE YOUR ROAD TEST.

363
00:25:15,646 --> 00:25:17,615
I MEAN, HOW DIFFERENT CAN YOU

364
00:25:17,615 --> 00:25:20,851
AND YOUR TWIN SISTER ACTUALLY BE?

365
00:25:20,851 --> 00:25:23,421
( laughs )

366
00:25:23,421 --> 00:25:26,123
- WHAT ABOUT ME?
- WAIT A MINUTE, STAND BACK.

367
00:25:26,123 --> 00:25:27,892
DON'T CROWD ME. I'M A LIVING TIME BOMB

368
00:25:38,702 --> 00:25:40,738
- OKAY.
- HI.

369
00:25:44,842 --> 00:25:47,945
LAST NAME FIRST, FIRST NAME LAST.

370
00:25:47,945 --> 00:25:50,781
ANDERSON. LES ANDERSON.

371
00:25:50,781 --> 00:25:53,517
BUCKLE UP, SON! IT'S
THE REAL WORLD OUT HERE!

372
00:25:55,019 --> 00:25:56,821
ANDERSON?

373
00:25:56,821 --> 00:25:58,756
I WANT YOU TO TAKE A LONG,

374
00:25:58,756 --> 00:26:01,258
HARD LOOK AT THIS CUP OF COFFEE.

375
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,428
I LOVE MY COFFEE.

376
00:26:04,428 --> 00:26:06,630
IT'S PROBABLY THE ONE
THING I TRULY CHERISH

377
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:08,899
ON THIS GODFORSAKEN
MUDBALL CALLED EARTH.

378
00:26:08,899 --> 00:26:10,401
WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY

379
00:26:10,401 --> 00:26:14,872
IS THAT MOST EXAMINERS USE A CLIPBOARD.

380
00:26:14,872 --> 00:26:17,174
I DON'T BELIEVE IN THEM.

381
00:26:17,174 --> 00:26:19,777
WHAT IDOBELIEVE IN IS MY CUP OF COFFEE.

382
00:26:19,777 --> 00:26:22,113
NOW THAT COFFEE'S HOT,
FILLED RIGHT TO THE BRIM.

383
00:26:22,113 --> 00:26:24,348
IF IT SPILLED ON ME, IT'S
PROBABLY BURN ME, HUH?

384
00:26:24,348 --> 00:26:25,850
- SPEAK UP, SON!
- YEAH, YEAH.

385
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:28,152
- NOBODY LIKES TO GET BURNED, DO THEY?
- NO.

386
00:26:28,152 --> 00:26:30,821
SO IT'S REAL SIMPLE. YOU BURN ME

387
00:26:30,821 --> 00:26:32,523
YOU FAIL.

388
00:26:32,523 --> 00:26:34,725
YOU DON'T, YOU PASS.

389
00:26:34,725 --> 00:26:36,093
IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT.

390
00:26:51,542 --> 00:26:53,644
Examiner £1: ALL RIGHT, ANDERSON.

391
00:26:53,644 --> 00:26:56,514
LET'S START OFF WITH SOME LIGHT TRAFFIC.

392
00:26:56,514 --> 00:26:59,717
-( honking )
-( sirens wailing )

393
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:08,893
NOW I WANT YOU TO GET OVER IN THAT LANE.

394
00:27:08,893 --> 00:27:09,927
NOW.

395
00:27:17,034 --> 00:27:20,571
Examiner £2: VERY GOOD, NATALIE.

396
00:27:20,571 --> 00:27:23,040
NOW, WHY DON'T YOU HEAD
UP TO THE LEFT HERE?

397
00:27:25,409 --> 00:27:27,912
LET'S SEE HOW YOU HANDLE THIS HILL.

398
00:27:30,147 --> 00:27:31,916
VERY GOOD.

399
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:34,351
Examiner £1: ANDERSON,
LET'S PULL TO A STOP

400
00:27:34,351 --> 00:27:36,921
- RIGHT HERE.
- Les: HERE?

401
00:27:41,158 --> 00:27:44,595
( car honking )

402
00:27:44,595 --> 00:27:48,232
- ( honks )
- WHAT THE HECK'S WRONG WITH HIM?

403
00:27:48,232 --> 00:27:51,302
EVERY TIME I COME UP THIS
ROAD THERE'S SOME IDIOT KID.

404
00:27:51,302 --> 00:27:54,338
-COME ON, YOU MORON!
-WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR, CHRISTMAS?

405
00:27:54,338 --> 00:27:57,575
OUGHT TO HAVE A TRUCK
TO GET THAT THING MOVING.

406
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:05,349
HA HA!

407
00:28:05,349 --> 00:28:09,019
OKAY, NATALIE, I'D LIKE YOU TO
STOP RIGHT NEXT TO THIS CAR HERE.

408
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:12,690
GOOD.

409
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:15,626
NOW WHY DON'T YOU
PARALLEL PARK RIGHT HERE?

410
00:28:19,163 --> 00:28:21,932
VERY, VERY, VERY GOOD!

411
00:28:25,803 --> 00:28:29,039
ANDERSON, I WANT YOU TO MAKE
A PARALLEL PARK RIGHT IN HERE.

412
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:32,376
- IN THERE?
- WHAT AM I SPEAKING, GREEK? IN HERE.

413
00:28:44,989 --> 00:28:46,257
HA!

414
00:28:48,993 --> 00:28:51,629
CONGRATULATIONS. HERE'S YOUR LICENSE.

415
00:28:51,629 --> 00:28:55,132

416
00:28:55,132 --> 00:28:56,834
- GOOD MORNING. HOW ARE YOU?
- LOUSY!

417
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:03,841
- ( tires screech )
- I GOT IT!I GOT IT!

418
00:29:03,841 --> 00:29:05,276
SLOW DOWN!

419
00:29:15,186 --> 00:29:17,888
YOU'RE IN LUCK, ANDERSON.

420
00:29:17,888 --> 00:29:19,423
THE CUP...

421
00:29:19,423 --> 00:29:21,792
WAS EMPTY. ( laughs )

422
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,930
SEE YOU ON THE BATTLEFIELD
SOMETIME, SOLDIER.

423
00:29:28,733 --> 00:29:31,368
CONGRATULATIONS. HERE'S YOUR LICENSE.

424

00:29:35,272 --> 00:29:38,008
MR. ANDERSON. JUST A MINUTE.

426
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:42,046
SOMEONE WANTS TO SPEAK WITH YOU.

427
00:29:48,619 --> 00:29:51,722
( heart beating )

428
00:29:55,526 --> 00:29:57,828
( footsteps echoing )

429
00:30:04,702 --> 00:30:07,204
WELL, MR. ANDERSON,

430
00:30:07,204 --> 00:30:09,206
WE WERE ABLE TO RETRIEVE

431
00:30:09,206 --> 00:30:11,575
YOUR TEST RESULTS FROM THE COMPUTER.

432
00:30:11,575 --> 00:30:15,146
AND I SUPPOSE YOU
ALREADY KNOW YOU FAILED.

433
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,182
GOD GIVETH

434
00:30:18,182 --> 00:30:20,885
AND THE D.M.V. TAKETH AWAY.

435
00:30:20,885 --> 00:30:22,787
YOU MUSTN'T FUCK

436
00:30:22,787 --> 00:30:25,556
WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF
VEHICLES, MR. ANDERSON.

437
00:30:25,556 --> 00:30:28,426
WE CAN MAKE YOUR LIFE A LIVING HELL.

438
00:30:29,927 --> 00:30:31,328
( gasps )

439
00:30:38,035 --> 00:30:41,372
- ( honking )
- ( radio playing )

440
00:30:44,575 --> 00:30:46,444
( sighs )

441
00:31:25,282 --> 00:31:28,486
- Mrs. Anderson: HI!
- Mr. Anderson: HI, WE'RE HOME!

442
00:31:28,486 --> 00:31:30,454
WHERE IS EVERYBODY?

443
00:31:32,189 --> 00:31:35,059
- PLEASE, WE'LL KEEP THE
PLASTIC ON-- - YEAH-- NO--

444
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:38,729
- Les: MOM? DAD?
- YEAH, IN HERE. SHH.

445
00:31:38,729 --> 00:31:41,265
MOM? DAD? HI.

446
00:31:41,265 --> 00:31:44,435
Mr. Anderson: YEAH, HI,
SPORT. WHAT'S THE GOOD WORD?

447
00:31:44,435 --> 00:31:46,804
UM...

448
00:31:46,804 --> 00:31:49,540
I HAVE TO TELL YOU GUYS SOMETHING.

449
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:53,210
OH NO, YOU PUT A DENT
IN THE CAR ALREADY?

450
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:54,979
WHAT IS IT, HONEY?

451
00:31:58,783 --> 00:32:01,018
UM...

452
00:32:01,018 --> 00:32:03,454
- I-- - Mr.
Anderson: WHAT?

453
00:32:04,588 --> 00:32:06,657
WHAT?

454
00:32:09,026 --> 00:32:11,362
## I'M A FREE MAN! ##

455
00:32:11,362 --> 00:32:12,963
- WOW! YEAH!
- YES!

456
00:32:12,963 --> 00:32:15,433
- CONGRATULATIONS.
- THANK YOU.

457
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:17,735
SO TELL ME, WAS IT MURDER? WAS IT TOUGH?

458
00:32:17,735 --> 00:32:20,805
NOT AT ALL, DAD. IT WAS LIKE
TAKING CANDY FROM A BABY.

459
00:32:20,805 --> 00:32:22,406
GREAT. LOOK,

460
00:32:22,406 --> 00:32:24,975
I FILLED YOUR MOM'S CAR UP WITH SOME GAS

461
00:32:24,975 --> 00:32:28,245
JUST IN CASE YOU FELT LIKE
TAKING IT FOR A LITTLE SPIN.

462
00:32:28,245 --> 00:32:30,681
- Mrs. Anderson: HOW SWEET.
- WELL, DAD.

463
00:32:30,681 --> 00:32:33,918
I WAS KIND OF THINKING ABOUT GOING
TO MY ROOM AND TAKING A LITTLE NAP.

464
00:32:33,918 --> 00:32:36,387
- I'M EXHAUSTED.
- HONEY, WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

465
00:32:36,387 --> 00:32:39,423
- SAY "AH!"
- MOM, COME ON, WHAT COULD BE WRONG WITH ME?

466
00:32:39,423 --> 00:32:41,559
- IT'S THE GREATEST DAY OF MY LIFE!
- I KNOW.

467
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:44,328
SO WHY DON'T YOU TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF YOUR FATHER'S SENILITY

468
00:32:44,328 --> 00:32:47,398
- AND TAKE MY CAR FOR A SPIN?
- GO AHEAD.

469
00:32:47,398 --> 00:32:50,034
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU
GUYS REMEMBER OR NOT,

470
00:32:50,034 --> 00:32:52,737
BUT 16 YEARS OF WAITING AND DREAMING

471
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:55,139
IS A LOT OF PRESSURE. AND I'M NOT SURE

472
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:57,174
THAT BEING BEHIND THE WHEEL OF A CAR

473
00:32:57,174 --> 00:32:59,176
IS THE RIGHT PLACE
FOR ME TO BE RIGHT NOW.

474
00:32:59,176 --> 00:33:01,312
( rings )

475
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:06,417
- HELLO?
-( cheering )

476
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:09,253
DID YOU HEAR THAT? YOU DID
IT, MAN. HOW DOES IT FEEL?

477
00:33:09,253 --> 00:33:11,088
Les: Dean, What's going on?

478
00:33:11,088 --> 00:33:14,625
HOLD ON A SECOND. I'M
LOOKING FOR MY CAR KEYS.

479
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:17,194
FOUND THEM RIGHT HERE,
NEXT TO MY A.A.A. CARD.

480
00:33:17,194 --> 00:33:19,296
GREAT. NOW COME OVER AND PICK US UP.

481
00:33:20,598 --> 00:33:23,367
- UH, I CAN'T.
-Of course, you can.

482
00:33:23,367 --> 00:33:25,936
YOU CAN DO ANYTHING,
LES. YOU HAVE A LICENSE.

483
00:33:25,936 --> 00:33:28,072
WHAT? SEE THAT, DEAN, MY MOM'S CALLING.

484
00:33:28,072 --> 00:33:31,375
THEY'RE ALREADY ASKING ME TO RUN
ERRANDS. I HAVE TO GO. GOODBYE!

485
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:35,846
( humming )

486
00:33:48,893 --> 00:33:50,928
"TEST FAILED"?

487
00:33:51,996 --> 00:33:54,231
UH-OH.
UH-OH.

488
00:33:54,231 --> 00:33:55,800
ROBERT!

489
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,635
## Trouble ##

490
00:33:57,635 --> 00:33:59,203
## Trouble ##

491
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:02,339
ALL RIGHT, MERCEDES! HA-HA. YEAH!

492
00:34:02,339 --> 00:34:04,442
WELL, YOU KNOW--
LOWER IT, IT'S RINGING.

493
00:34:04,442 --> 00:34:06,143
COME HERE.

494
00:34:06,143 --> 00:34:09,980
- ( rings )
- HELLO?

495
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:12,516
RUDY, MOM'S GOT BROWNIES IN THE KITCHEN.

496
00:34:12,516 --> 00:34:14,452
- GO! HURRY,
QUICK! - BUT--

497
00:34:14,452 --> 00:34:17,488
- DAD, WHAT DO YOU NEED?
- LES, MY BOY.

498
00:34:17,488 --> 00:34:21,025
WE'RE DRINKING A TOAST TO YOU.

499
00:34:21,025 --> 00:34:23,627
Mercedes: Hello? Hello?

500
00:34:23,627 --> 00:34:25,162
Hello?!

501
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:29,433
DAD, THAT'S REALLY THOUGHTFUL OF YOU,

502
00:34:29,433 --> 00:34:31,702
BUT I SHOULDN'T BE DRINKING AND DRIVING.

503
00:34:31,702 --> 00:34:33,871
I KNOW THAT, LES. I KNOW THAT.

504
00:34:33,871 --> 00:34:35,406
- HAVE A
DRINK. - BUT I--

505
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:38,943
YOU JUST SAVED ME $26,000.

506
00:34:38,943 --> 00:34:41,746
- WHAT?
- FIRST RAISE YOUR GLASS

507
00:34:43,013 --> 00:34:46,150
TO SAVING ME 26,000 BUCKARONIS.

508
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:48,285
HOW DID I DO THAT, DAD?

509
00:34:48,285 --> 00:34:50,855
SIMPLE. 23,000 FOR THE BMW,

510
00:34:50,855 --> 00:34:52,790
3,000 FOR THE INSURANCE.

511
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:54,925
- I DON'T GET IT.
-NO?

512
00:34:54,925 --> 00:34:56,994
-NO.
- GET IT?

513
00:34:59,296 --> 00:35:00,931
Both: HE FAILED?

514
00:35:00,931 --> 00:35:03,734
HE FAILED AND HE LIED.

515
00:35:05,236 --> 00:35:07,371
LOOK, DAD,

516
00:35:07,371 --> 00:35:09,473
I FIGURED THAT I CAN
GET THROUGH THE WEEKEND

517
00:35:09,473 --> 00:35:11,308
AND THEN TAKE IT OVER MONDAY, YOU KNOW?

518
00:35:11,308 --> 00:35:13,611
I KNOW WHAT YOU FIGURED.

519
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:17,748
LISTEN, YOU'RE GROUNDED FOR TWO WEEKS.

520
00:35:17,748 --> 00:35:20,184
IT'S NOT THE END OF THE WORLD.

521
00:35:20,184 --> 00:35:22,119
- FEELS LIKE IT.
-( doorbell rings )

522
00:35:27,091 --> 00:35:30,494
-GOOD EVENING, KARL.
- GOOD EVENING, MRS. ANDERSON.

523
00:35:30,494 --> 00:35:33,931
- IS NATASHA AT HOME?
- SHE'LL BE DOWN IN A SECOND.

524
00:35:33,931 --> 00:35:36,834
- HOW ARE YOU FEELING?
- FINE. FINE.

525
00:35:36,834 --> 00:35:39,036
- FINE, THANK YOU.
- I ADMIRE YOU.

526
00:35:39,036 --> 00:35:42,373
I REALLY ADMIRE YOU
FOR HAVING THE COURAGE

527
00:35:42,373 --> 00:35:44,742
TO BRING A CHILD INTO
THIS OPPRESSIVE WORLD.

528
00:35:44,742 --> 00:35:46,844
- AND LET ME JUST-- -
( screaming )NATALIE!

529
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:53,117
NATASHA, WE'RE GOING TO A PROTEST.

530
00:35:53,117 --> 00:35:55,119
DO WE HAVE TO TAKE YOUR MOTHER'S

531
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:57,188
IMPERIALIST GAS GUZZLER?

532
00:35:57,188 --> 00:36:00,191
WOULD YOU RATHER TAKE MY
GRANDFATHER'S CADILLAC?

533
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,836
( sighs )

534
00:36:43,768 --> 00:36:46,537
( rings )

535
00:36:49,673 --> 00:36:52,443
- HELLO?
- HI, IS LES IN, PLEASE?

536
00:36:52,443 --> 00:36:55,913
- YEAH, THIS IS LES.
- HI, THIS IS MERCEDES.

537
00:36:55,913 --> 00:36:58,449
Do you remember me?

538
00:36:58,449 --> 00:37:01,118
REMEMBER YOU? YES, OF
COURSE. HI, HOW ARE YOU?

539
00:37:01,118 --> 00:37:03,354
ACTUALLY, I'M A LITTLE LONELY.

540
00:37:03,354 --> 00:37:06,357
I thought that we had a date tonight,

541
00:37:06,357 --> 00:37:09,126
AND I FIGURED I'D CALL YOU
SINCE YOU HADN'T CALLED ME.

542
00:37:09,126 --> 00:37:11,262
OH, UM,
WELL, I--

543
00:37:11,262 --> 00:37:15,299
I WAS OUT ALL DAY. I
WAS DEEP-SEA FISHING.

544
00:37:15,299 --> 00:37:18,803
SO YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED YOUR
MIND ABOUT TONIGHT, HAVE YOU?

545
00:37:18,803 --> 00:37:20,871
TONIGHT? NOW?

546
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:23,708
- NO.
-Great.

547
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:25,910
SO YOU CAN PICK ME UP IN 20 MINUTES?

548
00:37:29,613 --> 00:37:31,882
- LES?
-Hang on.

549
00:37:51,168 --> 00:37:53,637
AN INNOCENT GIRL,

550
00:37:53,637 --> 00:37:55,906
A HARMLESS DRIVE.

551
00:37:55,906 --> 00:37:58,509
WHAT COULD POSSIBLY GO WRONG?

552
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:05,282
MERCEDES?

553
00:38:05,282 --> 00:38:07,118
I'LL BE THERE IN HALF AN HOUR.

554
00:38:24,869 --> 00:38:27,638
( groaning )

555
00:38:46,357 --> 00:38:47,758
OH MAN!

556
00:38:47,758 --> 00:38:50,494
NO! NO! NO!

557
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:55,533
NO, NOT THE BUSHES!

558
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:07,378
( snores )

559
00:39:13,484 --> 00:39:15,019
GOD!

560
00:39:19,757 --> 00:39:21,992
OH! AH!

561
00:39:21,992 --> 00:39:23,694
- SH-- -(
bulb breaks )

562
00:39:33,804 --> 00:39:35,740
( engine starts )

563
00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:50,721
( gasps )

564
00:39:52,123 --> 00:39:54,759
OW! OW!

565
00:39:58,529 --> 00:40:01,532
HMM. HMM?

566
00:40:07,705 --> 00:40:11,442
DON'T WORRY, IT WAS
NOTHING. GO BACK TO SLEEP.

567
00:40:11,442 --> 00:40:13,544
MMM... THAT'S NICE.

568
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:27,291
( doorbell rings )

569
00:40:38,402 --> 00:40:39,937
LET'S GO.

570
00:40:47,845 --> 00:40:51,282
Radio: ## 'Cause you spell trouble ##

571
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:53,617
## Trouble ##

572
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:57,054
## I tried to please you,
but I'm wasting my time ##

573
00:40:57,054 --> 00:40:58,656
## You're nothing but trouble ##

574
00:40:58,656 --> 00:41:00,758
## Trouble ##

575
00:41:00,758 --> 00:41:03,527
## Trouble, baby ##

576
00:41:06,063 --> 00:41:07,965
## Trouble. ##

577
00:41:19,577 --> 00:41:22,279
- Woman: THANK YOU.
- TAKE GOOD CARE OF MY CAR, PAL.

578
00:41:22,279 --> 00:41:24,048
YES, SIR. ( laughs )

579
00:41:24,048 --> 00:41:25,816
( tires screech )

580
00:41:30,388 --> 00:41:32,390
-( loud crash )
-( tapping on glass )

581
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:33,858
COME ON, MAN, OPEN UP!

582
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:36,227
-LET'S GO!
- OPEN THE DOOR, LES.

583
00:41:36,227 --> 00:41:38,696
DID YOU SEE THAT? IF
I LET HIM PARK MY CAR

584
00:41:38,696 --> 00:41:40,431
HE'LL RUIN MY TRANSMISSION. NO WAY!

585
00:41:43,034 --> 00:41:45,036
HEY, WHAT ABOUT MY TIP?

586
00:41:49,907 --> 00:41:51,642
HERE WE ARE.

587
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:55,446
WAIT, WE CAN'T PARK HERE.
IT'S A TOW-AWAY ZONE.

588
00:41:55,446 --> 00:41:57,681
ON A SATURDAY NIGHT?

589
00:41:57,681 --> 00:42:00,885
YOU'RE ACTING LIKE IT'S THE
FIRST TIME YOU'VE EVER DRIVEN.

590
00:42:14,632 --> 00:42:16,934
( club music playing )

591
00:42:16,934 --> 00:42:19,236
- HEY, BABY.
- HI.

592
00:42:19,236 --> 00:42:21,706
- WHOA, WHOA! WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
- I'M WITH HER.

593
00:42:23,274 --> 00:42:26,410
YOU WOULDN'T BE WITH HER IF
SHE WAS YOUR SIAMESE TWIN!

594
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:28,646
- LOSE YOURSELF, KID.
- MERCEDES!

595
00:42:32,116 --> 00:42:34,185
HI!

596
00:42:34,185 --> 00:42:37,088
- IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU.
- HI.

597
00:42:43,761 --> 00:42:45,363
DAMN IT!

598
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:50,501
- PAOLO?
- MERCEDES.

599
00:42:50,501 --> 00:42:52,670
WHAT A LOVELY SURPRISE IT IS TO SEE YOU.

600
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:56,340
- I HAVE TO TALK TO YOU.
- BY THE WAY, THIS IS VERONIQUE.

601
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:58,743
SHE'S GOING TO BE MOVING IN WITH ME.

602
00:42:58,743 --> 00:43:01,545
IS THIS THE ONE YOU TOLD ME ABOUT?

603
00:43:02,747 --> 00:43:04,682
WOULD YOU LIKE A
DRINK? GIVE HER A DRINK.

604
00:43:04,682 --> 00:43:07,385
- WHAT ARE YOU HAVING?
- NOTHING.

605
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:18,963
MERCEDES! HEY, ARE YOU OKAY?

606
00:43:20,664 --> 00:43:24,035
OH MY GOD. MY CAR!

607
00:43:26,504 --> 00:43:28,639
WHOA! JESUS!

608
00:43:29,874 --> 00:43:33,544
WAIT, WAIT! WAIT! HOLD UP!

609
00:43:33,544 --> 00:43:35,379
GET OFF MY TRUCK, BOY!

610
00:43:35,379 --> 00:43:39,150
LOOK, MISTER, YOU
CAN'T DO THIS TO MY CAR!

611
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:41,152
BOY, I'VE DRIVEN WITH DEER, ANTELOPE,

612
00:43:41,152 --> 00:43:43,154
EVEN BEARS STRAPPED TO THAT BUMPER.

613
00:43:43,154 --> 00:43:45,156
AIN'T NO 65-LB. SACK OF FLYSHIT

614
00:43:45,156 --> 00:43:47,291
LIKE YOU GONNA SHAKE
ME A HELL A DIFFERENCE.

615
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:49,393
I'LL PAY YOU. I'LL GIVE
YOU EVERYTHING I GOT!

616
00:43:50,594 --> 00:43:52,630
- ( tires screech )
- AAH!

617
00:43:57,034 --> 00:43:59,637
JUST HOW MUCH YOU TALKING ABOUT?

618
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:06,644
- PLEASE, SIR, BE GENTLE.
- ( laughs )

619
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:10,848
FOR 80 BUCKS?!

620
00:44:10,848 --> 00:44:12,450
( laughs louder )

621
00:44:15,886 --> 00:44:18,322
80 BUCKS!

622
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:30,334
WOULD YOU LIKE SOME CHAMPAGNE?

623
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:32,737
- IT MIGHT HELP.
- NO, THANKS.

624
00:44:32,737 --> 00:44:34,739
I ALREADY HAD SOME TONIGHT.

625
00:44:36,207 --> 00:44:39,243
I'M REALLY SORRY ABOUT THE CAR.

626
00:44:39,243 --> 00:44:42,246
- I FEEL LIKE IT WAS ALL MY FAULT.
- DON'T BE SILLY.

627
00:44:42,246 --> 00:44:45,483
I SHOULD HAVE GIVEN THE CAR TO
THE VALET IN THE FIRST PLACE.

628
00:44:45,483 --> 00:44:47,885
I'M SORRY ABOUT YOUR FRIEND.

629
00:44:47,885 --> 00:44:51,122
HE WAS A JERK ANYWAYS. I DON'T
KNOW WHY I EVEN HUNG AROUND HIM.

630
00:44:53,858 --> 00:44:56,827
- LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.
- AND GO WHERE?

631
00:44:56,827 --> 00:44:59,063
WITH THE AMOUNT OF
MONEY I HAVE IN MY POCKET

632
00:44:59,063 --> 00:45:01,198
WE HAVE TWO CHOICES.

633
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:04,602
WE CAN EITHER SIT IN FRONT A
PARKING METER FOR 20 MINUTES,

634
00:45:04,602 --> 00:45:07,004
OR GO BUY OURSELVES A NEWSPAPER.

635
00:45:10,641 --> 00:45:12,843
LET ME TELL YOU. I KNOW A QUIET SPOT

636
00:45:12,843 --> 00:45:15,112
WITH PLENTY OF FREE PARKING.

637
00:45:21,018 --> 00:45:23,621
( shocks creaking )

638
00:45:24,689 --> 00:45:27,024
ARE YOU SURE THERE'S A ROAD HERE?

639
00:45:28,693 --> 00:45:30,594
THANK GOD.

640
00:45:51,816 --> 00:45:55,019
HEY, IT'S AMAZING UP HERE.

641
00:45:55,019 --> 00:45:57,621
HOW DID YOU EVER FIND THIS PLACE?

642
00:45:57,621 --> 00:46:00,491
SOMEONE I KNOW USED TO TAKE ME HERE.

643
00:46:02,927 --> 00:46:05,062
NOT A BOYFRIEND.

644
00:46:05,062 --> 00:46:07,164
MY FATHER USED TO TAKE ME HERE

645
00:46:07,164 --> 00:46:10,201
TO SHOW ME HOW BEAUTIFUL
THE WORLD COULD BE

646
00:46:10,201 --> 00:46:12,636
IF YOU COULD STEP AWAY
AND SEE IT AT A DISTANCE.

647
00:46:16,741 --> 00:46:19,710
- I HAVEN'T BEEN HERE IN A LONG TIME.
- NO, NO, NO.

648
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:22,313
NOT ON THE CAR. I MEAN,
I'LL GET YOU A BLANKET.

649
00:46:24,348 --> 00:46:27,385
- YOU SURE COME PREPARED.
- LIKE A BOY SCOUT.

650
00:46:27,385 --> 00:46:29,587
-LES?
- YES?

651
00:46:29,587 --> 00:46:31,889
I'M SORRY I DRAGGED YOU INTO ALL THIS.

652
00:46:33,657 --> 00:46:36,293
- I DON'T USUALLY ACT LIKE THIS.
- NO, IT'S OKAY.

653
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:37,828
I DON'T MIND.

654
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:42,533
HERE YOU GO.

655
00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:49,640
- I'M REALLY GLAD I CALLED YOU TONIGHT.
- YEAH?

656
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:53,010
I'M-- I'M
REALLY GLAD TOO.

657
00:46:54,578 --> 00:46:57,348
ALL WE'RE MISSING NOW IS
SOME SOFT ROMANTIC MUSIC.

658
00:46:57,348 --> 00:46:59,483
HOLD ON.

659
00:47:06,757 --> 00:47:09,160
-( soft music plays )
-( music stops )

660
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:15,833
OH MAN.

661
00:47:21,939 --> 00:47:24,408
OH GREAT. GRANDPA'S TOP 10!

662
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:36,620
-( soft music plays )
- ( groans )

663
00:47:41,392 --> 00:47:44,362
WAIT-- AREN'T YOU
DRINKING RATHER HEAVILY?

664
00:47:44,362 --> 00:47:46,797
## Strangers in the night ##

665
00:47:46,797 --> 00:47:49,600
-## Exchanging glances... ##
- DO YOU WANT TO DANCE?

666
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,836
-## Wandering in the night... ##
- TO THIS?

667
00:47:51,836 --> 00:47:53,804
- UH, YEAH. WHERE?
- RIGHT UP HERE.

668
00:47:53,804 --> 00:47:56,574
YOU COULDN'T PRAY FOR
A MORE ROMANTIC SETTING.

669
00:47:58,409 --> 00:48:01,278
- ( metallic scraping )
- YEAH, I GUESS SO.

670
00:48:05,282 --> 00:48:08,686
## Something in your eyes ##

671
00:48:08,686 --> 00:48:11,088
## Was so inviting ##

672
00:48:11,088 --> 00:48:13,591
## Something in your smile ##

673
00:48:13,591 --> 00:48:16,327
## Was so exciting... ##

674
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:20,765
- MAYBE I SHOULD TAKE MY SHOES OFF.
- YEAH.

675
00:48:20,765 --> 00:48:22,600
GOOD IDEA.

676
00:48:26,771 --> 00:48:30,174
## Strangers in the night ##

677
00:48:30,174 --> 00:48:32,209
## Two lonely people ##

678
00:48:32,209 --> 00:48:35,446
## We were strangers in the night ##

679
00:48:35,446 --> 00:48:37,448
## Up to the moment ##

680
00:48:37,448 --> 00:48:40,251
## When we said our first hello ##

681
00:48:40,251 --> 00:48:43,087
## Little did we know ##

682
00:48:43,087 --> 00:48:45,523
## Love was just a glance away ##

683
00:48:45,523 --> 00:48:48,926
## A warm, embracing dance away... ##

684
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:50,461
( hood creaking )

685
00:48:50,461 --> 00:48:52,630
GET UP! GET OFF! GET OFF THE CAR!

686
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:56,067
- WHAT'S THE MATTER, LES?
- THE HOOD, IT'S CAVING IN. GET OFF QUICK!

687
00:48:56,067 --> 00:48:57,802
LITTLE LES, I LOVE THIS SONG.

688
00:48:57,802 --> 00:49:00,705
THEN YOU DEFINITELY HAD TOO
MUCH TO DRINK. COME ON, GET OFF.

689
00:49:00,705 --> 00:49:03,541
( giggling )

690
00:49:03,541 --> 00:49:05,609
OH WOW! STAY HERE.

691
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:10,348
( Mercedes giggling )

692
00:49:10,348 --> 00:49:12,350
( laughing )

693
00:49:13,918 --> 00:49:15,853
COME ON, GET IN.

694
00:49:15,853 --> 00:49:17,455
- OH!
- SHH.

695
00:49:17,455 --> 00:49:20,558
WE'VE GOT TO GET THIS
THING FIXED. SLIDE OVER.

696
00:49:20,558 --> 00:49:22,993
( engine stalling )

697
00:49:22,993 --> 00:49:25,463
MERCEDES, PLEASE.

698
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:31,068
YOU HAVE SUCH BABY-SOFT SKIN.

699
00:49:35,172 --> 00:49:37,208
## Ever since that night ##

700
00:49:37,208 --> 00:49:39,577
## We've been together... ##

701
00:49:39,577 --> 00:49:41,579
( snoring )

702
00:49:46,050 --> 00:49:49,687
DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE NOISE,
MAN. MY PARENTS ARE VAMPIRES.

703
00:49:49,687 --> 00:49:52,390
AND I'LL TELL YOU
SOMETHING. YOU HAVE BALLS.

704
00:49:52,390 --> 00:49:55,960
YOU DEFINITELY HAVE BALLS
FOR SNAGGING THIS CAR.

705
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:57,862
I'M IMPRESSED.

706
00:49:57,862 --> 00:50:00,431
ALL RIGHT, LES. LET'S SEE THE LICENSE.

707
00:50:00,431 --> 00:50:02,767
NO WAY. FORGET IT, GUYS. IT'S UGLY.

708
00:50:02,767 --> 00:50:05,369
OF COURSE IT IS. BIG DEAL.

709
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:07,371
- Charles: COME ON, LES.
- NO WAY!

710
00:50:07,371 --> 00:50:09,306
- LET ME TAKE A PICTURE OF IT.
-FORGET IT.

711
00:50:09,306 --> 00:50:11,575
DON'T YOU THINK HE SHOULD
LET ME TAKE A PICTURE OF IT?

712
00:50:11,575 --> 00:50:13,844
- OKAY. CHARLES, OKAY.
-ALL RIGHT.

713
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:16,313
- SAY "CHEESE"!
- CHEESE.

714
00:50:17,515 --> 00:50:19,483
GREAT.

715
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:24,989
WELL, TAKE A LOOK,
LES. WHAT DO YOU THINK?

716
00:50:24,989 --> 00:50:27,258
- EXCELLENT WORK, DEAN.
- THANKS.

717
00:50:27,258 --> 00:50:29,260
THIS IS SPECTACULAR!

718
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:31,062
YOU SAVED ME, MAN. THANKS.

719
00:50:33,798 --> 00:50:37,001
SO, I GUESS WE CAN GO TO ARCHIES NOW?

720
00:50:37,001 --> 00:50:39,336
LOOK, DEANO, PAL, I PROMISE YOU,

721
00:50:39,336 --> 00:50:41,338
NEXT WEEKEND, YEAH, FINE, OKAY.

722
00:50:41,338 --> 00:50:43,107
WE CAN GO TO ARCHIES. BUT NOT TONIGHT.

723
00:50:43,107 --> 00:50:45,543
MERCEDES DOESN'T HAVE TO
BE HOME FOR A COUPLE HOURS.

724
00:50:45,543 --> 00:50:48,079
LES, LET ME EXPLAIN SOMETHING TO YOU.

725
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:50,381
UNLESS YOU'RE INTO SOME
INTENSE KINKY SHIT--

726
00:50:50,381 --> 00:50:52,149
AND YOU NEVER KNOW AFTER TONIGHT,

727
00:50:52,149 --> 00:50:54,819
THIS MERCEDES HAS A DEAD BATTERY.

728
00:50:56,420 --> 00:51:00,558
LES, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
ARCHIES ATOMIC HERE.

729
00:51:00,558 --> 00:51:02,460
YOU CAN'T GET THERE WITHOUT A LICENSE.

730
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:04,195
IT'S IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE.

731
00:51:04,195 --> 00:51:05,830
NO BUSSES, NO TRAINS, NO PLANES.

732
00:51:05,830 --> 00:51:08,265
ONLY THE SLICKEST, MOST
INTENSE DRIVING MACHINES

733
00:51:08,265 --> 00:51:10,401
YOU'VE EVER SEEN IN YOUR LIFE.

734
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:14,138
I HAVE THE DIRECTIONS MY BROTHER
GAVE ME IN MY BACK POCKET.

735
00:51:14,138 --> 00:51:17,041
YOU WON'T REGRET THIS. THERE'S
FIVE GIRLS FOR EVERY GUY.

736
00:51:17,041 --> 00:51:19,510
AND WE'RE NOT TALKING
DOGS, WE'RE TALKING BUNNIES.

737
00:51:19,510 --> 00:51:21,445
DEAN, DID YOU WIPE YOUR FEET OFF?

738
00:51:21,445 --> 00:51:23,647
YES, I WIPED THE CONCRETE OFF MY FEET.

739
00:51:23,647 --> 00:51:25,316
HEY, CHARLES, PUSH IN THE LIGHTER.

740
00:51:25,316 --> 00:51:28,185
I GOT A SURPRISE FOR EVERYBODY.

741
00:51:28,185 --> 00:51:30,554
NO WAY. NOT IN HERE. HUH-UH.

742
00:51:30,554 --> 00:51:32,890
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH
YOU, LES? THIS IS A CAR,

743
00:51:32,890 --> 00:51:34,558
IT'S NOT AN OXYGEN TENT.

744
00:51:34,558 --> 00:51:37,361
DEAN, IF THERE'S ANY EVIDENCE
AT ALL THAT I TOOK THIS CAR

745
00:51:37,361 --> 00:51:40,731
MY DAD'S GONNA SLAUGHTER ME FIRST
AND ASK QUESTIONS LATER, OKAY?

746
00:51:40,731 --> 00:51:43,634
- STOP IT!
- ( cars honking )

747
00:51:53,577 --> 00:51:57,515
- ( sweeper honking )
- HEY, LES, THIS IS GREAT AND ALL,

748
00:51:57,515 --> 00:51:59,483
BUT COULD TAKE THE CAR OUT OF NEUTRAL?

749
00:51:59,483 --> 00:52:01,585
WE JUST GOT PASSED BY A STREET-SWEEPER.

750
00:52:04,722 --> 00:52:07,058
( honks )

751
00:52:07,058 --> 00:52:09,460
( loud heavy metal music playing )

752
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:12,363
Man: HEY, GIRLS, WHOSE
CAR YOU DRIVING, GRANDMA'S?

753
00:52:12,363 --> 00:52:14,532
COME ON, RACE HIM.

754
00:52:14,532 --> 00:52:16,233
LET'S MESS WITH THE FAGGOTS, MAN.

755
00:52:18,569 --> 00:52:20,671
WAIT,
GET THAT--

756
00:52:23,874 --> 00:52:25,810
( engine revving )

757
00:52:33,317 --> 00:52:34,752
GO!

758
00:52:37,388 --> 00:52:40,558
Dean: LES, WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?

759
00:52:40,558 --> 00:52:42,593
ARE YOU 16 OR 60?

760
00:52:42,593 --> 00:52:45,563
YOU COULD HAVE GIVEN THOSE
GEARHEADS A RUN FOR THEIR MONEY.

761
00:52:45,563 --> 00:52:47,331
DEAN THIS IS MY GRANDFATHER'S CAR.

762
00:52:47,331 --> 00:52:49,934
GIVE ME A CAR THAT I'M
NOT GENETICALLY RELATED TO,

763
00:52:49,934 --> 00:52:51,702
I PROMISE THINGS WILL CHANGE, OKAY?

764
00:52:51,702 --> 00:52:55,439
- HONEY.
- OKAY, OKAY, OKAY!

765
00:52:55,439 --> 00:52:57,641
OKAY, I'M COUNTING. DO YOUR BREATHING.

766
00:52:57,641 --> 00:53:00,111
( breathing quickly ) OKAY.

767
00:53:00,111 --> 00:53:02,780
IS IT HOT IN HERE?

768
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:04,582
IS IT HOT OR IS IT JUST ME?

769
00:53:04,582 --> 00:53:08,853
- IT'S HOT?
- IT'S LIKE A SAUNA IN HERE.

770
00:53:08,853 --> 00:53:12,156
WANT ME TO GO DOWN TO THE GARAGE
AND TURN ON THE AIR CONDITIONING?

771
00:53:12,156 --> 00:53:15,860
NO, THAT'S OKAY. I LIKE
TO JUST SIT HERE AND SWEAT.

772
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:17,795
I'LL TURN ON THE AIR CONDITIONING.

773
00:53:30,875 --> 00:53:32,643
( moans )

774
00:53:49,026 --> 00:53:51,328
Mrs. Anderson on intercom: Hey, Robert?

775
00:53:51,328 --> 00:53:52,997
Robert?!

776
00:53:54,598 --> 00:53:58,069
- YES?
- I'M NOT HOT ANYMORE. I'M HUNGRY.

777
00:53:58,069 --> 00:54:00,938
Will you make me a sandwich, please?

778
00:54:00,938 --> 00:54:03,974
- OKAY, HONEY.
-Sardines and pickles, okay?

779
00:54:03,974 --> 00:54:05,209
( groans )

780
00:54:08,045 --> 00:54:10,247
( cars honking )

781
00:54:12,983 --> 00:54:15,486
## Saturday night is
the loneliest night ##

782
00:54:15,486 --> 00:54:18,022
## Of the week ##

783
00:54:18,022 --> 00:54:21,926
## 'Cause that's the night
that my sweetie and I ##

784
00:54:21,926 --> 00:54:24,829
## Used to dance cheek to cheek ##

785
00:54:24,829 --> 00:54:28,999
## I don't mind Sunday night at all ##

786
00:54:28,999 --> 00:54:33,237
## 'Cause that's the night
friends come to call ##

787
00:54:33,237 --> 00:54:36,707
## And Monday through Friday's a gas ##

788
00:54:36,707 --> 00:54:40,378
## And another week goes past ##

789
00:54:40,378 --> 00:54:42,380
## But Saturday night ##

790
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:46,050
## Is the loneliest night of the week ##

791
00:54:46,050 --> 00:54:48,352
## I sing the song ##

792
00:54:48,352 --> 00:54:50,621
## That I sang for the memories... ##

793
00:54:50,621 --> 00:54:52,857
- YOU ASSHOLE, DO UP HER SHIRT.
- NO WAY.

794
00:54:52,857 --> 00:54:55,059
FORGET ABOUT IT. I MEAN, LOOK AT US.

795
00:54:55,059 --> 00:54:57,495
WE'RE THREE WILD ANIMALS
BOMBING DOWN THE HIGHWAY

796
00:54:57,495 --> 00:54:59,330
WITH THE CRUISE CONTROL SET TO 55 M.P.H.

797
00:54:59,330 --> 00:55:01,499
I DON'T NEED A TICKET
ON MY FIRST NIGHT OUT.

798
00:55:01,499 --> 00:55:03,734
GOD DAMN IT, STOP THAT!

799
00:55:03,734 --> 00:55:05,836
WHAT IS THIS CRAP WE'RE LISTENING TO?

800
00:55:05,836 --> 00:55:08,139
MY PARENTS DON'T EVEN LISTEN TO THIS!

801
00:55:10,408 --> 00:55:12,843
- GIVE ME THAT CAMERA!
- NO!

802
00:55:12,843 --> 00:55:15,880
GOD DAMN IT, DEAN, IT'S NOT YOUR CAMERA.

803
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:18,382
- GIVE ME THE CAMERA. GIVE ME IT!
- NO! NO!

804
00:55:18,382 --> 00:55:19,884
- GIVE ME IT!
- NO!

805
00:55:19,884 --> 00:55:22,653
- JESUS!
- WATCH OUT!

806
00:55:30,594 --> 00:55:32,663
OH, WE'RE GONNA DIE!

807
00:55:32,663 --> 00:55:35,933
-I TOLD YOU THIS WAS GONNA HAPPEN.
- SHIT!

808
00:55:47,244 --> 00:55:50,214
- Charles: LES,
STOP THE CAR! -UH-OH.

809
00:55:50,214 --> 00:55:52,283
( all scream )

810
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:15,473
I THINK I'M GONNA THROW UP.

811
00:56:15,473 --> 00:56:18,042
( screams )

812
00:56:18,042 --> 00:56:20,678
- GET HER OUT OF THE CAR, QUICK!
- HELP! HELP!

813
00:56:20,678 --> 00:56:23,014
HELP! GET HER OFF OF ME!

814
00:56:23,014 --> 00:56:24,982
- NOT IN THE CAR, PLEASE!
- I'M TRAPPED!

815
00:56:29,253 --> 00:56:30,788
( screams )

816
00:56:30,788 --> 00:56:33,024
LES, I APOLOGIZE FOR EVERYTHING,

817
00:56:33,024 --> 00:56:35,693
BUT THAT RIDE WAS DEFINITELY
WORTH THE PRICE OF ADMISSION.

818
00:56:35,693 --> 00:56:37,995
THAT MAKES UP FOR A
WHOLE LIFE OF BOREDOM.

819
00:56:37,995 --> 00:56:39,663
THERE'S A SCRATCH ON MY CAR.

820
00:56:41,298 --> 00:56:43,034
WHERE?

821
00:56:43,034 --> 00:56:45,936
RIGHT THERE. RIGHT HERE,
THERE'S A BIG OLD SCRATCH.

822
00:56:45,936 --> 00:56:48,739
-HOLD ON, LET ME SEE.
- MY DAD'LL MURDER ME. LOOK AT THIS!

823
00:56:48,739 --> 00:56:51,342
-THERE IS NO SCRATCH.
-THERE IS A SCRATCH HERE.

824
00:56:51,342 --> 00:56:54,412
A TINY LITTLE SCRATCH. YOUR DAD
IS NOT GOING TO SEE THAT SCRATCH.

825
00:56:54,412 --> 00:56:56,747
YOUR DAD'S A 40-YEAR-OLD
GUY WHO WEARS GLASSES.

826
00:56:56,747 --> 00:56:59,550
NOT AN EAGLE, OKAY? NOW LISTEN TO ME.

827
00:56:59,550 --> 00:57:02,553
WE ARE TWO SECONDS AWAY FROM
ARCHIES. DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

828
00:57:02,553 --> 00:57:05,656
YOU LISTEN TO ME. TWO
SECONDS OR NOT TWO SECONDS.

829
00:57:05,656 --> 00:57:07,992
WATCH MY LIPS. WE'RE
NOT GOING TO ARCHIES.

830
00:57:07,992 --> 00:57:10,795
WE'RE NOT DRIVING IN MY
GRANDFATHER'S CADILLAC ANYMORE.

831
00:57:10,795 --> 00:57:13,030
WE ARE IN FACT GOING HOME, OKAY?

832
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:16,200
- Dean: NO, IT'S NOT OKAY!
- YOU DON'T LOOK TOO GOOD.

833
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:19,804
- ( Mercedes moans )
- Dean: WE CANNOT TURN AROUND NOW.

834
00:57:19,804 --> 00:57:21,472
WE'D BETTER GET YOU A SODA.

835
00:57:22,973 --> 00:57:25,509
YOU HAVE WORKED REALLY HARD

836
00:57:25,509 --> 00:57:27,712
FOR THAT LICENSE IN YOUR WALLET.

837
00:57:27,712 --> 00:57:31,315
YOU'VE HAD 16 YEARS OF HUMILIATION,

838
00:57:31,315 --> 00:57:33,317
BEGGING FOR LIFTS FROM PEOPLE

839
00:57:33,317 --> 00:57:35,353
WHO COULDN'T GIVE A
SHIT ABOUT YOUR IMAGE.

840
00:57:35,353 --> 00:57:38,022
LES, YOU'VE HAD TO STAND AND WATCH

841
00:57:38,022 --> 00:57:41,258
AS ALL THE PRETTY GIRLS DROVE
OFF IN SOME OLDER JERK'S CAR.

842
00:57:41,258 --> 00:57:43,527
HUMILIATION-- I KNOW,
I'VE BEEN THROUGH IT!

843
00:57:43,527 --> 00:57:45,329
BUT THAT'S ALL OVER NOW.

844
00:57:45,329 --> 00:57:48,933
LES, THAT THING IN YOUR WALLET,

845
00:57:48,933 --> 00:57:51,068
THAT'S NO ORDINARY PIECE OF PAPER.

846
00:57:51,068 --> 00:57:52,903
THAT IS A DRIVER'S LICENSE!

847
00:57:52,903 --> 00:57:55,172
IT IS NOT ONLY A DRIVER'S LICENSE,

848
00:57:55,172 --> 00:57:57,141
IT'S AN AUTOMOBILE LICENSE!

849
00:57:57,141 --> 00:57:59,110
AND IT'S NOT ONLY AN AUTOMOBILE LICENSE,

850
00:57:59,110 --> 00:58:01,012
IT IS A LICENSE TO LIVE,

851
00:58:01,012 --> 00:58:05,282
A LICENSE TO BE FREE,
TO GO WHEREVER, WHENEVER,

852
00:58:05,282 --> 00:58:07,618
AND WITH WHOMEVER YOU CHOOSE.

853
00:58:07,618 --> 00:58:10,287
( player piano playing )

854
00:58:19,430 --> 00:58:21,899
ARCHIES, MAN. LET'S DO IT.

855
00:58:21,899 --> 00:58:24,535
- DEANO, I DON'T KNOW.
- LES,

856
00:58:24,535 --> 00:58:26,637
TO LIVE IN FEAR

857
00:58:26,637 --> 00:58:29,173
IS NOT TO LIVE AT ALL.

858
00:58:34,178 --> 00:58:36,013
WHAT ABOUT MERCEDES?

859
00:58:37,682 --> 00:58:39,917
I DON'T THINK THIS IS SUCH A GOOD IDEA.

860
00:58:39,917 --> 00:58:41,585
OF COURSE IT'S A GOOD IDEA.

861
00:58:41,585 --> 00:58:44,021
IN HALF AN HOUR, THERE'S
GONNA BE BABES ALL OVER US.

862
00:58:44,021 --> 00:58:46,123
SHE'LL KILL IT FOR US.

863
00:58:50,327 --> 00:58:53,497
WOW, DID YOU EVER
IMAGINE IN ALL YOUR LIFE

864
00:58:53,497 --> 00:58:57,301
THAT YOU WOULD SEE A MERCEDES FIT
INSIDE THE TRUNK OF A CADILLAC?

865
00:58:57,301 --> 00:58:59,236
LOOK, I FEEL BAD ABOUT THIS.

866
00:58:59,236 --> 00:59:01,605
FEEL BAD? FOR HER?

867
00:59:01,605 --> 00:59:04,875
THIS TRUNK IS BIGGER THAN
THE SIZE OF MY BEDROOM.

868
00:59:04,875 --> 00:59:06,644
LET'S GO.

869
00:59:10,081 --> 00:59:11,882
NIGHTY-NIGHT.

870
00:59:16,987 --> 00:59:20,925
## CHILLS OVER ME ##

871
00:59:20,925 --> 00:59:23,894
## DIFFERENT FROM THE REST ##

872
00:59:23,894 --> 00:59:25,730
## I WON'T SETTLE FOR LESS ##

873
00:59:25,730 --> 00:59:27,598
## HELLO ##

874
00:59:30,001 --> 00:59:32,837
-## WON'T TAKE NO ##
-## Won't take no ##

875
00:59:32,837 --> 00:59:35,339
## OH, BABY ##

876
00:59:35,339 --> 00:59:38,976
## FROM NOW ON, YOU AND I ##

877
00:59:40,177 --> 00:59:42,480
## STOOD THE TEST OF TIME ##

878
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:46,050
## STILL YOU'RE ON MY MIND ALWAYS ##

879
00:59:48,552 --> 00:59:51,355
-## NIGHT AND DAY ##
-## Night and day ##

880
00:59:51,355 --> 00:59:53,924
-## OH BABY... ##
- WHOA!

881
00:59:53,924 --> 00:59:56,193
HONEY! I LOVE YOU!

882
00:59:56,193 --> 00:59:59,296
HEY, EYES FORWARD.

883
00:59:59,296 --> 01:00:00,965
Dean: LOOK AT HER!

884
01:00:03,701 --> 01:00:05,903
HEY, COME BACK HERE.

885
01:00:05,903 --> 01:00:08,172
## YOU KNOW YOU ARE MY LIFE, GIRL ##

886
01:00:08,172 --> 01:00:10,141
## CRUCIAL ##

887
01:00:10,141 --> 01:00:12,610
## BABY, YOU'RE THE ONE ##

888
01:00:12,610 --> 01:00:15,246
## CRUCIAL LOVIN'... ##

889
01:00:15,246 --> 01:00:16,847
HI!

890
01:00:16,847 --> 01:00:19,350
-## BABY ##
-## Crucial... ##

891
01:00:19,350 --> 01:00:21,919
HEY, HEY, HEY. HEY GUYS.

892
01:00:21,919 --> 01:00:24,722
WAIT UP FOR A SECOND. WHY DON'T
YOU GUYS GO GET SOME DINNER?

893
01:00:24,722 --> 01:00:27,992
I'M GONNA GET DESSERT.
ALL RIGHT? GO, GO.

894
01:00:29,627 --> 01:00:31,028
HI!

895
01:00:31,028 --> 01:00:34,265
## LOVE IS ON THE RISE ##

896
01:00:34,265 --> 01:00:37,168
## DON'T WANT TO BE ALONE ##

897
01:00:37,168 --> 01:00:40,571
## I NEED TO FIND SOMEONE ##

898
01:00:40,571 --> 01:00:42,973
## I CAN CALL MY OWN ##

899
01:00:42,973 --> 01:00:45,776
## NOT JUST ANYONE ##

900
01:00:46,844 --> 01:00:48,879
## OH NO... ##

901
01:00:48,879 --> 01:00:51,816
- HERE YOU GO.
- Charles: THANK YOU.

902
01:00:52,983 --> 01:00:55,653
GUYS, IT'S ALL SET UP.

903
01:00:55,653 --> 01:00:57,621
I TOOK CARE OF EVERYTHING.

904
01:00:57,621 --> 01:01:00,191
THEY'LL BE HERE IN A FEW
MINUTES-- ONE FOR EACH OF US.

905
01:01:00,191 --> 01:01:02,460
DEAN, I WILL NEVER DOUBT YOU AGAIN.

906
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:04,962
- I KNOW YOU WON'T!
- MY DREAMS NEVER GET THIS GOOD.

907
01:01:04,962 --> 01:01:07,031
MY FANTASIES NEVER GET THIS GOOD!

908
01:01:07,031 --> 01:01:09,500
AND THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING!

909
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:10,968
- WHOO!
- WHOA!

910
01:01:10,968 --> 01:01:12,603
Les: YEAH, LET'S EAT!

911
01:01:22,046 --> 01:01:23,547
SORRY.

912
01:01:25,049 --> 01:01:27,651
- QUICK, ROLL UP THE WINDOWS!
- THOSE ASSHOLES AGAIN.

913
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:31,989
CHARLES, YOU SPASTICATED IDIOT!

914
01:01:31,989 --> 01:01:35,726
Charles: IT WAS AN ACCIDENT!
ROLL UP THE WINDOWS!

915
01:01:35,726 --> 01:01:38,029
HEY, MY HAMBURGER!

916
01:01:38,029 --> 01:01:40,264
GIVE ME MY HAMBURGER. OW! OW!

917
01:01:40,264 --> 01:01:43,034
- Dean: ROLL THE WINDOW DOWN.
- Charles: NO, KEEP IT UP!

918
01:01:43,034 --> 01:01:45,036
-ROLL IT DOWN!
-NO, KEEP IT UP!

919
01:01:45,036 --> 01:01:47,271
-( engine stalling )
- HEY, COME HERE!

920
01:01:49,273 --> 01:01:51,275
- HI!
- GOD DAMN IT!

921
01:01:51,275 --> 01:01:53,110
( engine starts )

922
01:01:53,110 --> 01:01:56,313
- YOU CAN'T LEAVE NOW. WHAT ABOUT THE GIRLS?
- THEY'RE MANIACS.

923
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:18,369
Dean: ARCHIES, COME BACK!

924
01:02:18,369 --> 01:02:20,705
COME BACK!

925
01:02:20,705 --> 01:02:23,040
COME BACK!

926
01:02:25,209 --> 01:02:28,446
Anchorwoman: I'm standing outside
the gates of Allied Technologies

927
01:02:28,446 --> 01:02:31,949
where a group of peaceful protesters
are gathered to demonstrate against

928
01:02:31,949 --> 01:02:35,286
the late-night transportation of
military hardware through our streets.

929
01:02:35,286 --> 01:02:38,589
NOW, JIM, AS YOU CAN SEE, THERE'S
A WIDE RANGE OF PEOPLE HERE

930
01:02:38,589 --> 01:02:40,758
- ALL SINGING AND CHANTING...
- I DON'T KNOW.

931
01:02:40,758 --> 01:02:43,127
I DON'T THINK THIS IS SUCH
A GOOD IDEA. CAN WE GO HOME?

932
01:02:43,127 --> 01:02:45,696
LOOK, DEAN, WE'RE GOING
HOME. AND IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT

933
01:02:45,696 --> 01:02:48,699
YOU CAN JUMP OUT RIGHT HERE--
WHEREVER THE HELL WE ARE.

934
01:02:52,770 --> 01:02:55,873
HEY, THAT LOOKS LIKE MY MOM'S AUDI.

935
01:03:06,083 --> 01:03:09,653
HOLY SHIT! I THINK WE'RE BEING INVADED!

936
01:03:09,653 --> 01:03:13,057
- ( sirens blaring )
- HERE THEY COME!

937
01:03:16,794 --> 01:03:18,229
COME ON!

938
01:03:21,632 --> 01:03:24,535
HEY! NO, NO, NOT ON MY
CAR! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

939
01:03:26,137 --> 01:03:28,472
MY CAR! MY CAR!

940
01:03:28,472 --> 01:03:30,107
HEY, I KNOW THAT GUY!

941
01:03:30,107 --> 01:03:32,710
HE LOOKS LIKE MY SISTER'S BOYFRIEND!

942
01:03:32,710 --> 01:03:35,546
- LES?
- SHIT, MY SISTER! DUCK!

943
01:03:35,546 --> 01:03:38,616
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!
- NATALIE, DON'T TELL DAD.

944
01:03:38,616 --> 01:03:40,685
- I BEG YOU!
- YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE A LICENSE!

945
01:03:40,685 --> 01:03:42,319
NATALIE, DON'T TELL DAD!

946
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:44,922
P.A.: All right, let's
round these people up.

947
01:03:44,922 --> 01:03:46,824
Cuff them and put them in the wagon.

948
01:03:46,824 --> 01:03:48,926
EXCUSE ME!

949
01:03:50,127 --> 01:03:51,562
SHIT.

950
01:03:51,562 --> 01:03:53,698
AS YOU CAN SEE BEHIND ME,

951
01:03:53,698 --> 01:03:55,466
WHAT STARTED AS A PEACEFUL PROTEST

952
01:03:55,466 --> 01:03:58,469
has now mushroomed into a
substantial demonstration.

953
01:03:58,469 --> 01:04:00,838
It seems that tempers
flared when executives

954
01:04:00,838 --> 01:04:03,607
from Allied Technologies
refused to speak to rep--

955
01:04:03,607 --> 01:04:05,576
( snores )

956
01:04:07,111 --> 01:04:09,613
- Dean: OH MY GOD!
- Les: WHAT WAS GOING ON BACK THERE?

957
01:04:09,613 --> 01:04:12,950
Dean: I DON'T KNOW, BUT I'LL TELL YOU,
THIS CADDY SURE CAN TAKE A BEATING.

958
01:04:12,950 --> 01:04:15,353
Les: NOT HALF THE BEATING YOU'LL GET

959
01:04:15,353 --> 01:04:17,188
UNLESS YOU CLAM UP, DEAN!

960
01:04:23,127 --> 01:04:25,930
OH THIS IS GREAT. THIS IS REAL CLASSIC.

961
01:04:25,930 --> 01:04:28,366
Charles: THEY MUST BE
CHECKING FOR DRUNK DRIVERS.

962
01:04:28,366 --> 01:04:31,002
-YEAH, NO SHIT!
- DON'T SWEAT IT.

963
01:04:31,002 --> 01:04:32,870
THINK OF YOUR LICENSE AS A CREDIT CARD.

964
01:04:32,870 --> 01:04:35,272
SOONER OR LATER, YOU'VE
GOT TO BREAK IT IN.

965
01:04:35,272 --> 01:04:37,575
PULL OVER ON THE CURB, RIGHT OVER THERE.

966
01:04:37,575 --> 01:04:39,744
Dean: AND WHAT ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT?

967
01:04:39,744 --> 01:04:43,114
WE'RE SOBER. THEY'RE HERE TO
CATCH DRUNKS, LIKE THAT DICK.

968
01:04:43,114 --> 01:04:45,549
HAVE YOU HAD ANYTHING
TO DRINK TONIGHT, SIR?

969
01:04:45,549 --> 01:04:48,185
TAKE IT EASY.

970
01:04:48,185 --> 01:04:49,787
LICENSE AND REGISTRATION.

971
01:04:54,225 --> 01:04:56,494
LICENSE AND REGISTRATION, SON.

972
01:04:57,862 --> 01:04:59,930
UM, SIR,

973
01:04:59,930 --> 01:05:01,832
I FORGOT MY LICENSE AT HOME.

974
01:05:01,832 --> 01:05:03,834
BUT UM,

975
01:05:03,834 --> 01:05:06,704
I COULD GIVE YOU THIS.

976
01:05:13,277 --> 01:05:15,446
ALL RIGHT, SIT TIGHT.

977
01:05:16,681 --> 01:05:19,216
WHY DIDN'T YOU SHOW HIM YOUR LICENSE?

978
01:05:19,216 --> 01:05:22,253
WHAT WAS THAT THING YOU FLASHED
IN FRONT OF US AT THE HOUSE?

979
01:05:22,253 --> 01:05:23,954
MY SCHOOL I.D.

980
01:05:23,954 --> 01:05:25,890
ARE YOU TELLING US
THAT YOU LEFT THE HOUSE

981
01:05:25,890 --> 01:05:29,794
ON YOUR FIRST NIGHT OUT WITH
A LICENSE WITHOUT A LICENSE?

982
01:05:29,794 --> 01:05:32,797
NO, DEAN, I'M NOT TELLING YOU THAT.

983
01:05:32,797 --> 01:05:34,999
LOOK, GUYS,

984
01:05:34,999 --> 01:05:37,368
I FAILED MY EXAM.

985
01:05:37,368 --> 01:05:39,203
Both: YOU WHAT?!

986
01:05:39,203 --> 01:05:42,973
- PROPER GRAMMAR IS-- - THIS
PUNK DOESN'T EVEN HAVE A LICENSE.

987
01:05:42,973 --> 01:05:45,276
ALL RIGHT, SIR, WHAT I'D LIKE YOU TO DO

988
01:05:45,276 --> 01:05:47,912
IS TO TRY TO WALK THIS
LINE HERE, ALL RIGHT?

989
01:05:47,912 --> 01:05:49,680
- ALL RIGHT.
- PESKY, COME HERE.

990
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:51,949
YOU JUST KEEP WALKING.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

991
01:05:51,949 --> 01:05:54,585
WE HAVE TO CALL A WAGON
TO PICK THIS GUY UP.

992
01:05:54,585 --> 01:05:56,587
THIS IS GOING TO GO IN OUR RECORDS.

993
01:05:56,587 --> 01:05:59,824
WE'RE GONNA BE LOCKED UP IN A CELL
WITH MEN WHO'VE MURDERED AND RAPED

994
01:05:59,824 --> 01:06:01,592
AND ROBBED CONVENIENCE STORES!

995
01:06:01,592 --> 01:06:04,829
WILL YOU TAKE A PILL OR
SOMETHING? WILL YOU JUST RELAX?

996
01:06:04,829 --> 01:06:08,499
NOTHING'S GOING TO HAPPEN
TO US. WE'RE JUVENILES.

997
01:06:10,534 --> 01:06:12,536
NICE CALL, DEAN.

998
01:06:12,536 --> 01:06:15,206
ALL RIGHT, ANDERSON, LET'S
HAVE A LOOK INSIDE THE TRUNK.

999
01:06:18,709 --> 01:06:20,311
COME ON. I AIN'T GOT ALL NIGHT.

1000
01:06:21,379 --> 01:06:22,980
COME ON! COME ON!

1001
01:06:28,686 --> 01:06:30,688
HI, HOW YOU DOING?

1002
01:06:30,688 --> 01:06:33,691
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

1003
01:06:33,691 --> 01:06:36,027
MY DATE?

1004
01:06:36,027 --> 01:06:38,329
( siren wails )

1005
01:06:39,964 --> 01:06:43,134
WE GOT TO ROLL! THERE'S A
RIOT GOING ON AT ALLIED TECH!

1006
01:06:44,235 --> 01:06:46,270
YOU JUST GOT LUCKY, PAL.

1007
01:06:49,607 --> 01:06:51,442
LET'S GO.

1008
01:06:51,442 --> 01:06:53,778
( siren wails )

1009
01:06:53,778 --> 01:06:57,081
- Drunk: EXCUSE ME,
OFFICER-- - YES! PERFECT!

1010
01:06:57,081 --> 01:06:59,417
SEE, LES, WHAT DID I
TELL YOU? PIECE OF CAKE!

1011
01:06:59,417 --> 01:07:01,585
SHUT UP, HUH? HELP ME WITH HER.

1012
01:07:01,585 --> 01:07:03,821
DO SOMETHING USEFUL IN LIFE, WOULD YOU?

1013
01:07:04,889 --> 01:07:07,058
IT LOOKS LIKE A LINE. OH YEAH.

1014
01:07:09,427 --> 01:07:12,330
OH, MASERATI.

1015
01:07:12,330 --> 01:07:15,966
OH, THIS IS MUCH NICER THAN MINE.

1016
01:07:15,966 --> 01:07:17,668
KEYS?!

1017
01:07:19,170 --> 01:07:21,505
THIS CHICK IS NO PAPERWEIGHT.

1018
01:07:21,505 --> 01:07:24,075
- SO WHERE'S OUR NEXT STOP?
- THERE ARE NO STOPS, DEAN.

1019
01:07:24,075 --> 01:07:26,310
- WE'RE GOING HOME.
- ( engine starts )

1020
01:07:33,884 --> 01:07:35,553
OH, I'M DEAD.

1021
01:07:35,553 --> 01:07:38,289
I'M SO DEAD THEY'RE GONNA
HAVE TO BURY ME TWICE.

1022
01:07:38,289 --> 01:07:41,292
LET'S GO.

1023
01:07:41,292 --> 01:07:43,094
## Back on top in June... ##

1024
01:07:43,094 --> 01:07:44,929
LOOKS LIKE I'M IN FOR THE NIGHT.

1025
01:07:44,929 --> 01:07:46,797
## I said that's life... ##

1026
01:07:46,797 --> 01:07:50,234
- YOU CAN'T TAKE THIS CAR!
- HE TOOK OUR CAR. WE'LL TAKE HIS!

1027
01:07:54,405 --> 01:07:58,743
-## But I don't let it get me down... ##
- WHAT A WASTE.

1028
01:07:58,743 --> 01:08:00,778
NOW I'M SWINGING!

1029
01:08:02,179 --> 01:08:04,148
GO! GO!

1030
01:08:04,148 --> 01:08:07,418
## I'VE BEEN A PUPPET,
A PAUPER, A PIRATE ##

1031
01:08:07,418 --> 01:08:11,255
## A POET, A PAWN AND A KING ##

1032
01:08:11,255 --> 01:08:14,625
## I'VE BEEN UP AND DOWN
AND OVER AND OUT-- ##

1033
01:08:14,625 --> 01:08:17,495
WHERE THE HELL AM I?

1034
01:08:17,495 --> 01:08:19,096
- HE'S GOING LEFT!
- I SEE HIM!

1035
01:08:22,166 --> 01:08:23,968
All: WHOA!

1036
01:08:29,707 --> 01:08:33,110
- WHERE THE HELL'S THIS GUY GOING?
-## That's life... ##

1037
01:08:33,110 --> 01:08:34,679
YEAH, GO, SAMMY!

1038
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:39,684
OH! OH!

1039
01:08:42,019 --> 01:08:43,821
- SHIT!
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

1040
01:08:43,821 --> 01:08:45,723
I CAN FIX THAT. IT'S
ONLY THE RIGHT SIDE.

1041
01:08:45,723 --> 01:08:49,393
## Each time I find myself ##

1042
01:08:49,393 --> 01:08:52,296
-## Laying flat on my back... ##
- ( screams )

1043
01:08:52,296 --> 01:08:55,299
## I JUST PICK MYSELF UP ##

1044
01:08:55,299 --> 01:08:58,269
## AND GET BACK IN THE RACE ##

1045
01:08:58,269 --> 01:08:59,670
## THAT'S LIFE! ##

1046
01:09:06,477 --> 01:09:08,946
MY LIFE'S NO BED OF
ROSES, THAT'S FOR SURE.

1047
01:09:08,946 --> 01:09:11,982
PEOPLE ARE THE PROBLEM.
PEOPLE PUSHING ME AROUND!

1048
01:09:11,982 --> 01:09:15,219
I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU SAY TO THE
GUY, JUST GET HIM TO PULL OVER!

1049
01:09:15,219 --> 01:09:18,856
THE MAN IS A DRUNK LUNATIC. DON'T
YOU THINK THIS IS A LITTLE DANGEROUS?

1050
01:09:18,856 --> 01:09:21,993
YOU'RE TELLING ME ABOUT DANGEROUS?
WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S DANGEROUS?

1051
01:09:21,993 --> 01:09:24,261
ME GOING HOME AND HAVING
TO EXPLAIN TO MY FATHER

1052
01:09:24,261 --> 01:09:27,031
THAT THIS PIECE OF SHIT IS
MY GRANDFATHER'S CADILLAC.

1053
01:09:27,031 --> 01:09:30,301
HERE HE IS, AND YOU BETTER TALK TO HIM.

1054
01:09:31,469 --> 01:09:34,071
- BE TOUGH!
- EXCUSE ME, SIR?

1055
01:09:34,071 --> 01:09:36,741
SIR, PARDON ME. EXCUSE ME?

1056
01:09:36,741 --> 01:09:39,143
I BELIEVE THERE'S BEEN
A SLIGHT MIX-UP HERE.

1057
01:09:39,143 --> 01:09:42,680
IT SEEMS YOU'VE MISTAKENLY
DRIVEN OFF WITH OUR CAR.

1058
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:46,417
THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY
MUCH. YOU'RE VERY KIND.

1059
01:09:46,417 --> 01:09:50,388
- Les: WHAT THE HELL? - COME ON,
GET THE JUICE- HEAD TO PULL OVER!

1060
01:09:50,388 --> 01:09:52,523
- SIR?

1061
01:09:52,523 --> 01:09:54,291
( vomits )

1062
01:09:57,895 --> 01:10:01,032
LES, HE JUST VOMITED IN YOUR CAR.

1063
01:10:01,032 --> 01:10:02,833
( groans )

1064
01:10:02,833 --> 01:10:04,969
( gargling )

1065
01:10:07,138 --> 01:10:09,106
OH SHIT!

1066
01:10:15,646 --> 01:10:17,381
WHOO! WHAT AIRLINE IS THIS?!

1067
01:10:17,381 --> 01:10:19,650
COME ON, GO! YEAH!

1068
01:10:19,650 --> 01:10:21,485
- COME ON!
- SHUT UP, DEANO!

1069
01:10:21,485 --> 01:10:24,488
HEY, CHECK IT OUT. SPONGEHEAD'S
ACTUALLY DRIVING STRAIGHT.

1070
01:10:24,488 --> 01:10:26,190
WHAT HE DO, SOBER UP?

1071
01:10:29,293 --> 01:10:32,596
- ( snoring )
- Dean: HOLY SHIT!

1072
01:10:32,596 --> 01:10:34,899
- HE'S OUT COLD.
- OH SHIT!

1073
01:10:37,635 --> 01:10:41,305
CHARLES, YOU TAKE THE GAS. DEANO, YOU
TAKE THE WHEEL. I'M GOING OUT THERE.

1074
01:10:41,305 --> 01:10:43,274
WAIT A MINUTE! NO, LES, IT'S JUST A CAR!

1075
01:10:43,274 --> 01:10:46,243
YOU TRY TELLING THAT TO MY FATHER!

1076
01:10:46,243 --> 01:10:49,413
- Charles: BE CAREFUL, LES!
- HOLD IT STEADY!

1077
01:10:49,413 --> 01:10:52,717
- DEAN, HOLD THE CAR STEADY!
- COME ON.

1078
01:10:52,717 --> 01:10:55,686
KEEP IT STRAIGHT, WOULD YOU?

1079
01:10:58,089 --> 01:10:59,590
SHIT.

1080
01:10:59,590 --> 01:11:01,792
STOP IT.

1081
01:11:01,792 --> 01:11:04,295
- YOU'RE LOSING CONTROL.
-LES!

1082
01:11:04,295 --> 01:11:07,531
- ( ripping )
- WHOA!

1083
01:11:07,531 --> 01:11:09,867
I'M GONNA FALL! DEANO!

1084
01:11:09,867 --> 01:11:11,402
- GET AWAY!
- HOLY SHIT!

1085
01:11:11,402 --> 01:11:13,671
SHIT! WHOA!

1086
01:11:13,671 --> 01:11:15,339
DEANO! WHOA!

1087
01:11:15,339 --> 01:11:17,375
MISTER!

1088
01:11:17,375 --> 01:11:20,277
WAKE UP, WOULD YOU!? COME ON.

1089
01:11:20,277 --> 01:11:22,646
WAKE UP! PLEASE, WAKE UP!

1090
01:11:22,646 --> 01:11:25,449
WILL YOU GET YOUR
HAND OFF THE GODDAMN--

1091
01:11:25,449 --> 01:11:26,617
SHIT.

1092
01:11:27,718 --> 01:11:30,788
WHOA! DEANO, HELP!

1093
01:11:31,956 --> 01:11:33,824
Dean: WE'RE LOSING HIM!

1094
01:11:33,824 --> 01:11:35,593
HI, LES!

1095
01:11:44,035 --> 01:11:45,936
GOD, I HATE DRUNK DRIVERS.

1096
01:11:50,107 --> 01:11:53,310
WHAT?! OH NO!

1097
01:11:53,310 --> 01:11:55,079
WATCH THE ROAD, COME ON!

1098
01:11:57,948 --> 01:11:59,717
Both: OH SHIT!

1099
01:12:01,652 --> 01:12:04,021
NO, NO!

1100
01:12:06,257 --> 01:12:08,526
( screams )

1101
01:12:23,908 --> 01:12:26,210
( horn blaring )

1102
01:12:42,727 --> 01:12:44,662
( drunk snoring )

1103
01:12:47,398 --> 01:12:49,333
- ( horn stops )
- ( drunk mumbles )

1104
01:13:06,417 --> 01:13:09,987
- Charles: GET OUT OF THE CAR!
- Dean: YOU'RE STEPPING ON MY FACE!

1105
01:13:09,987 --> 01:13:12,056
OH, YOU'RE ALIVE! WE
THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD.

1106
01:13:12,056 --> 01:13:14,859
OH MY GOD, DID YOU SEE WHAT YOU DID?

1107
01:13:14,859 --> 01:13:16,827
HONEY, I'M HOME!

1108
01:13:16,827 --> 01:13:18,963
- WHO IS THIS GUY?
- I DON'T KNOW.

1109
01:13:18,963 --> 01:13:21,298
WHO ARE YOU?!

1110
01:13:21,298 --> 01:13:24,135
WELL, MY FRIEND, YOU'RE A
LITTLE THIEF. GIVE ME THOSE KEYS.

1111
01:13:24,135 --> 01:13:26,904
YES, BUT SEE, "FRIENDS DON'T
LET FRIENDS DRIVE DRUNK."

1112
01:13:26,904 --> 01:13:30,107
- ( laughs )
- YOU CALL YOURSELF A FRIEND?

1113
01:13:30,107 --> 01:13:32,476
LOOK, YOU WERE INCREDIBLE!

1114
01:13:32,476 --> 01:13:36,047
YOU ARE AN ANIMAL. I MEAN,
NOBODY'S GOING TO BELIEVE THIS!

1115
01:13:36,047 --> 01:13:39,450
YEAH, NOT TOO BAD FOR A KID
WITHOUT HIS LICENSE, HUH?

1116
01:13:58,469 --> 01:14:02,206
LES, I GOTTA TELL YOU,
LICENSE OR NO LICENSE,

1117
01:14:02,206 --> 01:14:05,109
THAT WAS ONE INTENSE DISPLAY OF DRIVING.

1118
01:14:05,109 --> 01:14:07,111
YEAH, AND AS FAR AS A FIRST NIGHT OUT

1119
01:14:07,111 --> 01:14:09,380
ON THE TOWN WITH A CAR IS CONCERNED,

1120
01:14:09,380 --> 01:14:11,615
THAT ONE DEFINITELY SETS THE STANDARD.

1121
01:14:11,615 --> 01:14:14,785
THANK GOD YOU DON'T GET YOUR LICENSE
FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS, BUDDY.

1122
01:14:14,785 --> 01:14:17,121
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO
TELL SLEEPING BEAUTY?

1123
01:14:17,121 --> 01:14:19,256
I DON'T KNOW.

1124
01:14:20,391 --> 01:14:22,393
SHH.

1125
01:14:22,393 --> 01:14:25,096
- GOOD NIGHT, LES.
- YEAH.

1126
01:14:25,096 --> 01:14:26,731
SEE YOU LATER, LES.

1127
01:14:38,976 --> 01:14:41,746
( moaning )

1128
01:14:45,316 --> 01:14:47,918
- ROBERT?
- MM?

1129
01:14:47,918 --> 01:14:50,621
THIS IS IT. ( chuckles )

1130
01:14:50,621 --> 01:14:53,691
- THAT'S NICE, HONEY.
- THIS IS IT.

1131
01:14:53,691 --> 01:14:56,127
I'M UP! I'M UP, I'M UP!

1132
01:14:56,127 --> 01:14:59,296
OKAY, DO YOUR BREATHING.
( rapid breathing )

1133
01:14:59,296 --> 01:15:01,732
HOW FAR APART ARE THE CONTRACTIONS?

1134
01:15:01,732 --> 01:15:04,235
FIVE MINUTES? FINE, PLENTY OF TIME.

1135
01:15:04,235 --> 01:15:08,272
THAT DREAM WAS SO BIZARRE, LES,

1136
01:15:08,272 --> 01:15:10,608
AS IF I WAS TRAPPED
IN THE TRUNK OF A CAR.

1137
01:15:10,608 --> 01:15:13,477
AND SUDDENLY THE TRUNK FLIPPED OPEN

1138
01:15:13,477 --> 01:15:16,847
AND THERE YOU WERE RESCUING ME.

1139
01:15:16,847 --> 01:15:19,850
- SO WEIRD.
- SOUNDS CRAZY.

1140
01:15:19,850 --> 01:15:22,653
OH, I KNOW IT SOUNDS
UNBELIEVABLE, BUT...

1141
01:15:22,653 --> 01:15:25,122
SOMEHOW YOU'RE ALWAYS THERE TO HOLD ME

1142
01:15:25,122 --> 01:15:27,024
LIKE YOU ARE RIGHT NOW.

1143
01:15:27,024 --> 01:15:30,661
I FELT SO SAFE AND SO WARM.

1144
01:15:32,196 --> 01:15:35,032
I'M SORRY I WAS SUCH A SLEEPY
- HEAD TONIGHT.

1145
01:15:35,032 --> 01:15:37,768
- YOU MUST HAVE BEEN SO BORED.
- NO, DON'T BE SILLY.

1146
01:15:37,768 --> 01:15:40,871
TONIGHT FOR ME WAS
LIKE NON-STOP ACTION.

1147
01:15:42,506 --> 01:15:45,609
- WHEN CAN WE GO OUT AGAIN?
- HONESTLY, MERCEDES,

1148
01:15:45,609 --> 01:15:48,479
TONIGHT MIGHT BE THE LAST NIGHT
ANYBODY EVER SEES ME ALIVE.

1149
01:15:48,479 --> 01:15:50,481
WHY? WHAT HAPPENED?

1150
01:15:51,882 --> 01:15:53,918
IT'S A LONG COMPLICATED STORY.

1151
01:15:53,918 --> 01:15:56,487
YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT IT.

1152
01:15:56,487 --> 01:15:58,356
DOES IT HAVE A HAPPY ENDING?

1153
01:15:59,724 --> 01:16:01,759
UH-HUH, HAS SO FAR.

1154
01:16:01,759 --> 01:16:04,161
HOPEFULLY ONE DAY I'LL GET
TO TELL YOU HOW IT ENDS.

1155
01:16:04,161 --> 01:16:06,397
I'LL BE HERE.

1156
01:16:14,772 --> 01:16:16,273
BYE.

1157
01:16:22,146 --> 01:16:23,681
- OW!
- THE BABY?

1158
01:16:23,681 --> 01:16:25,349
NO, THE LACES ARE TOO TIGHT.

1159
01:16:25,349 --> 01:16:27,585
- OKAY--
-ROBERT!

1160
01:16:27,585 --> 01:16:29,787
HONEY?

1161
01:16:29,787 --> 01:16:32,123
- ( chuckling )
- OH WAIT, LET ME GET MY JACKET.

1162
01:16:32,123 --> 01:16:34,925
- WHERE'S MY JACKET?
- OKAY, OKAY.

1163
01:16:34,925 --> 01:16:37,261
- OKAY.
- OH, I FORGOT THE BAG.

1164
01:16:37,261 --> 01:16:39,964
IT'S OKAY. I'M GONNA WAIT HERE.

1165
01:16:39,964 --> 01:16:41,966
- OKAY.
- OKAY, CALM DOWN, HONEY.

1166
01:16:41,966 --> 01:16:44,769
- YOU OKAY?
- YEAH, I'M FINE.

1167
01:16:44,769 --> 01:16:47,438
- OW! ANOTHER ONE.
- OH NO. OKAY.

1168
01:16:47,438 --> 01:16:50,041
OKAY. YEAH. PUT YOUR ARM ON ME.

1169
01:16:50,041 --> 01:16:52,143
( rapid breathing )

1170
01:16:53,711 --> 01:16:55,880
OH MAN.

1171
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:57,348
HERE WE GO.

1172
01:17:01,852 --> 01:17:03,788
( rattling )

1173
01:17:07,892 --> 01:17:10,528
( rapid breathing )

1174
01:17:10,528 --> 01:17:13,230
- UH-OH. -
WHAT? WHAT?

1175
01:17:13,230 --> 01:17:17,001
- WHAT?
- GOSH, I'M FINE.

1176
01:17:17,001 --> 01:17:20,237
- SORRY, I'M FINE NOW.
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN, YOU'RE FINE?

1177
01:17:20,237 --> 01:17:23,040
I THINK IT WAS AIR BUBBLES
FROM THE PICKLE OR SOMETHING.

1178
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:26,644
ARE YOU SURE? I MEAN,
THE CAR'S RIGHT HERE.

1179
01:17:26,644 --> 01:17:28,679
I'M SORRY. I'M FINE.

1180
01:17:31,282 --> 01:17:34,051
WHY IS THE GARAGE DOOR OPEN?

1181
01:17:34,051 --> 01:17:36,087
NATALIE PROBABLY LEFT IT OPEN.

1182
01:17:36,087 --> 01:17:38,222
NO, HONEY, NATALIE TOOK THE AUDI.

1183
01:17:38,222 --> 01:17:40,992
- WHERE THE HELL IS THE AUDI?
- ( muffled )OW.

1184
01:17:43,461 --> 01:17:45,763
ROBERT!

1185
01:17:45,763 --> 01:17:48,432
-WHAT THE--
-ROBERT!

1186
01:17:49,633 --> 01:17:51,402
HONEY, KEEP BREATHING!

1187
01:17:51,402 --> 01:17:54,105
WHOA! WHOA!

1188
01:17:54,105 --> 01:17:56,273
( rapid breathing )

1189
01:17:56,273 --> 01:17:58,843
( groaning )

1190
01:18:01,445 --> 01:18:03,914
( whimpering )

1191
01:18:12,623 --> 01:18:15,459
( moaning )

1192
01:18:25,836 --> 01:18:27,772
SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOUR BED, LES?

1193
01:18:29,807 --> 01:18:33,544
MIND EXPLAINING WHAT SIZE
SHARK WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS?

1194
01:18:35,346 --> 01:18:37,581
- WELL-- - NO, I
DON'T WANT TO KNOW!

1195
01:18:37,581 --> 01:18:39,583
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW.
SAVE IT FOR THE JUDGE.

1196
01:18:39,583 --> 01:18:42,853
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT
YOU'VE DONE TONIGHT, LES?

1197
01:18:42,853 --> 01:18:44,889
WHAT THIS MEANS TO YOUR FUTURE

1198
01:18:44,889 --> 01:18:46,824
IN THIS HOUSE AND ON THIS PLANET?

1199
01:18:46,824 --> 01:18:49,727
- I HAVE AN IDEA.
- NO, YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY!

1200
01:18:49,727 --> 01:18:51,696
YOU CAN'T EVEN BEGIN TO IMAGINE!

1201
01:18:53,397 --> 01:18:55,933
WE HAD A COLLEGE FUND SET ASIDE FOR YOU.

1202
01:18:55,933 --> 01:18:57,935
THAT'S GONE NOW.

1203
01:18:57,935 --> 01:18:59,637
YOU HAD FREE ROOM AND BOARD,

1204
01:18:59,637 --> 01:19:02,673
TWO TRUSTING PARENTS AND A SOCIAL LIFE.

1205
01:19:02,673 --> 01:19:04,675
IT'S ALL GONE.

1206
01:19:04,675 --> 01:19:08,479
YOU HAD A TV, A STEREO, A BASEBALL MITT,

1207
01:19:08,479 --> 01:19:10,448
A TENNIS RACKET, A SKATEBOARD,

1208
01:19:10,448 --> 01:19:13,184
A BICYCLE--
ALL GONE!

1209
01:19:13,184 --> 01:19:16,320
YOU EVEN HAD SUNLIGHT
AND A WINDOW IN YOUR ROOM.

1210
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:17,688
ROBERT!

1211
01:19:17,688 --> 01:19:20,291
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, BUDDY BOY,

1212
01:19:20,291 --> 01:19:23,527
YOU ARE DAMN LUCKY YOUR MOTHER

01:19:23,527 --> 01:19:25,363
ROBBY, IAM IN LABOR!

- HOW FAR APART ARE THE CONTRACTIONS?
- I DON'T KNOW.

1217
01:19:33,804 --> 01:19:36,040
YOU DON'T KNOW? IS IT
ONE MINUTE, TWO MINUTES?

1218
01:19:36,040 --> 01:19:38,075
- HOW CLOSE?
- TOO CLOSE.

1219
01:19:38,075 --> 01:19:39,577
NO HANDLE!

1220
01:19:39,577 --> 01:19:42,480
NO HANDLE. NO HANDLE.

1221
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:45,249
OKAY, HONEY, WE'LL BE IN
A HOSPITAL IN A MINUTE.

1222
01:19:45,249 --> 01:19:47,485
- SIT DOWN. WATCH YOUR HEAD.
- OH ROBERT.

1223
01:19:47,485 --> 01:19:50,087
- COME IN THE BACKSEAT WITH ME.
- NO, I CAN'T.

1224
01:19:50,087 --> 01:19:52,223
- I HAVE TO DRIVE.
- LES CAN DRIVE.

1225
01:19:52,223 --> 01:19:54,959
WHAT? LES WHO? NOT THAT LES.

1226
01:19:54,959 --> 01:19:57,595

1228
01:20:01,232 --> 01:20:03,067
DAD, LET ME DRIVE.

1229
01:20:04,869 --> 01:20:07,238
- I CAN DO IT, DAD.
- ( Mrs. Anderson screams )

1230
01:20:07,238 --> 01:20:10,741
ROBERT, PLEASE STAY WITH ME. I NEED YOU.

1231
01:20:12,677 --> 01:20:16,113
- DAD?
- OKAY, YOU DRIVE.

1232
01:20:16,113 --> 01:20:18,349
BUT TRY AND DO IT LIKE
YOU HAVE A LICENSE!

1233
01:20:18,349 --> 01:20:20,785
LET ME OPEN THE DOOR!

1234
01:20:24,155 --> 01:20:27,224
Rudy: EW! IT SMELLS LIKE PUKE IN HERE!

1235
01:20:27,224 --> 01:20:30,628
- Les: SHUT UP, RUDY.
- ( tires screech )

1236
01:20:32,530 --> 01:20:36,400
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!
- SORRY, IT'S A RED LIGHT.

1237
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:38,636
ARE YOU CRAZY? THERE ISN'T CAR IN SIGHT.

1238
01:20:38,636 --> 01:20:41,706
WE'RE RUSHING YOUR MOTHER TO THE
HOSPITAL, NOT TO A BRIDGE GAME!

1239
01:20:41,706 --> 01:20:43,474
COME ON, GO THROUGH IT. GO THROUGH IT.

1240
01:20:46,143 --> 01:20:47,712
WHAT ARE YOU DOING? COME ON!

1241
01:20:47,712 --> 01:20:49,513
I'M PUSHING THE GAS. IT AIN'T MOVING.

1242
01:20:49,513 --> 01:20:51,816
SOUNDS LIKE THE TRANSMISSION.
TRY ANOTHER GEAR.

1243
01:20:53,517 --> 01:20:55,186
- COME ON, TRY LOW.
- MOM?

1244
01:20:55,186 --> 01:20:57,855
DON'T WORRY, I'M JUST HAVING A BABY.

1245
01:20:59,256 --> 01:21:02,293
- WHAT WAS THAT?
- REVERSE WORKS, DAD.

1246
01:21:04,862 --> 01:21:06,530
HONEY?

1247
01:21:06,530 --> 01:21:08,899
LET HIM DRIVE BACKWARDS.

1248
01:21:08,899 --> 01:21:11,235
LET HIM DRIVE SIDEWAYS, I DON'T CARE.

1249
01:21:11,235 --> 01:21:13,604
JUST GET ME THERE!

1250
01:21:15,306 --> 01:21:17,274

1256
01:21:41,866 --> 01:21:44,669
Mr. Anderson: GO RIGHT! NO, LEFT!

1257
01:21:44,669 --> 01:21:46,537
NO, GO RIGHT! NO!

1258
01:21:48,339 --> 01:21:50,508
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
GET OFF THE SIDEWALK!

1259

WHAT ARE YOU DOING? LES,

1263
01:22:12,330 --> 01:22:16,600
LOOK OUT! WHERE'D YOU

01:23:53,798 --> 01:23:55,933
LOOK, DON'T WORRY ABOUT GRANDPA.
