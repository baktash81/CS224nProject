1
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:32,900
Damn!

2
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,700
Whiskey, let's find us
a nice little bank.

3
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,600
What do you know? I'm the boss.

4
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,500
That does it, Whiskey.

5
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,300
Now just for that, I'm going in alone.

6
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,500
Without me, you'll wind up
holding a broken chair together.

7
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,700
You say something?

8
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,000
Okay...

9
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,300
...but remember, I'm boss.

10
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:51,800
Cactus Jack Slade waits in the shade

11
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,200
Pondering his evil schemes

12
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:59,300
He's a well- known bad guy

13
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:05,200
Ready to try whatever it takes
To live up to his name

14
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:09,100
No one is safe from the villain

15
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:13,500
He totes a dangerous gun

16
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,600
And robbing and stealing
And just plain dirty dealing

17
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,300
Cactus Jack Slade gets it done

18
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:35,900
Get off the streets, he's the villain

19
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,100
Meet me in front.

20
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:48,800
Close all the stores
Lock all the doors

21
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:53,300
Cactus Jack Slade has arrived

22
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,400
- Who is it?
- The sheriff.

23
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,300
Open up.

24
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,800
You're not the sheriff.

25
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,100
I lied.

26
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:22,900
One, close the door. Two, open the
safe. Three, on the floor.

27
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,700
You forgot number two.

28
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:43,500
Oh, no, I didn't. I did that
when you stuck that gun in my face.

29
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:47,600
- Open that safe.
- The safe is locked for the night.

30
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,800
And only Mr. Simpson
has the combination.

31
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,300
I'm just a clerk.

32
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,900
Excuse me.

33
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,100
Got a light?

34
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,900
How about a cigar?

35
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,100
I don't smoke.

36
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,600
Oh, I should've had two...

37
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:02,700
- What's that noise?
- It came from the bank.

38
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,300
The sheriff's coming.

39
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,900
What are you doing, you traitor?
Whiskey? You traitor!

40
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,100
I'll get even with you.

41
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,600
You won't get away with this.

42
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,200
Traitor! I'll get even with you.

43
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:38,600
Get your hands off me.
Nobody pushes me around like this.

44
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,700
Here, ma'am, let me help you
cross the street.

45
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:06,000
Are you blind?
Don't you see all these horses?

46
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:10,100
We'll never live through this.
Watch out!

47
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,900
Are you trying to get me killed?
Oh, this is terrible.

48
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,300
Here, let me help you, ma'am.

49
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,500
See, Mother, safe and sound.

50
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:25,100
First of all, I ain't your mother.

51
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:28,600
Secondly,
take your arm off me, dummy!

52
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:33,700
And third, I didn't want to cross
the street in the first place.

53
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,900
Yes, ma'am.

54
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:54,500
Charming, you're gonna miss
your train.

55
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,800
Now remember what I told you.

56
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,800
Avery Simpson would steal the candy
from a young'un if he got the chance.

57
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,100
- Are you listening?
- Yes, Papa.

58
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:07,200
- Them shoes still on that mare?
- Hell, yes.

59
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:12,400
There's enough silver in that hill
to make a St. Louis hooker happy...

60
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,000
...but it won't do no good
in the hills, understand?

61
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:20,200
So you watch out
for that thieving Avery Simpson...

62
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:24,300
...or he'll wind up owning
all of my mine. You follow me?

63
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,800
One ticket to Snake's End.

64
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,400
That'll do it,
one ticket to Snake's End.

65
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,300
Going away on a business trip,
Mr. Parody?

66
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,100
None of your business, Charming.

67
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:44,500
Well, here's your ticket.
Well, take it. Bite on it.

68
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:48,600
I'll get ahold of somebody to meet you
in Snake's End.

69
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,400
And he'll protect you.

70
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,400
I can take care of myself.

71
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:59,500
Charming, I'm not worried about...
I'm worried about the money!

72
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:02,400
Bring the money right back
to the house.

73
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:07,900
- And be careful of strangers.
- Yes, Daddy.

74
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,100
Pardon me, sir.

75
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,700
- I'm Handsome Stranger.
- So?

76
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:26,800
That's my name.
You have a telegram for me.

77
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,700
Boy, you talk...

78
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,100
...funny.

79
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:37,300
Well, that's easy for you to say.
What about my telegram?

80
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,700
So I did. I forgot to write it down.

81
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,300
With all that commotion
and everything...

82
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,100
...going over at the bank...

83
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:50,800
But I do recollect what it said.

84
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,600
It was from a guy named...

85
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,600
...Parody Jones. He said...

86
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:01,700
...his daughter was coming into town
to pick something up at the bank.

87
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:05,100
And that you are supposed
to escort her...

88
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,700
...back out to his...

89
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,100
...place.

90
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:17,200
And then he said something
about you owing him.

91
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,500
That's true.

92
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:24,300
He saved my life once.
I've been beholden to him ever since.

93
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,300
When is Miss Jones arriving?

94
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,500
Miss Jones is...

95
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:33,300
Miss Jones is coming in
On the evening train

96
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,500
Do I still have time to eat?

97
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:40,800
Sure, you do. Just go on over
to the Broken Spoke and eat.

98
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,800
Broken Spoke? It's a saloon.

99
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,400
That's right.
And this here's a telegraph office.

100
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,900
To send a telegram, you come here.

101
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,200
It's the only place in town.

102
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:56,800
To eat, you go to the Broken Spoke,
because it's the only place in...

103
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,900
Thank you. Thank you.

104
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,600
...town.

105
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:06,300
Oh, I don't believe it.
Oh, easy. Go slow, go slow.

106
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,200
What happened?

107
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:16,500
She was trying to cross the street.
Got hit by a beer wagon.

108
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:21,500
I always say that alcohol and driving
don't mix. What a pity.

109
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,300
I thought I heard that voice!

110
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:29,900
Get out! I'll kill you!
Stop this stretcher! Get that man!

111
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:34,600
If it wasn't for you I wouldn't
have been hurt. Turn around!

112
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,800
Turn this stretcher! Get that man!

113
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,500
I'll teach you when I want to cross
the street!

114
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,900
You leave me alone!
I'm gonna make you...

115
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,400
- Morning, Mr. Avery.
- I want to see your prisoner.

116
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,500
I want to see him alone.

117
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,300
Traitor.

118
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,700
- Cactus Jack?
- Who are you?

119
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:22,100
I'm Avery Simpson.

120
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,900
I own the bank you blew up last night.

121
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,700
I used too much dynamite.

122
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,300
Well, I'm not mad at you
for blowing up my bank.

123
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:37,200
I'm not even mad at you for trying
to blow my safe apart.

124
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:41,000
I don't keep any money in it anyway.
I don't trust banks.

125
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,500
- You know why I'm not mad at you?
- Why?

126
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:50,300
Because you and me may be able
to do business together.

127
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,900
Now if we can...

128
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:57,100
...you'll walk out of here with me
scot-free.

129
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:02,100
And I'll give you $1000 cash tomorrow.

130
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,200
If we can't do business together,
the sheriff is gonna hang you...

131
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,100
...tonight.

132
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,900
I don't know.

133
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:19,300
- Well?
- I'm thinking, I'm thinking.

134
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,400
- It's a deal.
- Good.

135
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:39,100
A year ago I grubstaked
an old prospector.

136
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,700
For that I got half of everything.
You follow me?

137
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,900
Now he needs more money
to work the mine.

138
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,900
He's putting up the other half
as collateral.

139
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:52,200
I'm gonna lend him that money.
You follow me?

140
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:56,400
His daughter will take the cash back
in the morning.

141
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:02,000
I don't want it to get there.
If it don't, I'll get the whole mine.

142
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:06,900
- You still follow me?
- What about a little advance?

143
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:16,300
Here's $20, which
I'll deduct from the 500 you'll earn.

144
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:20,200
You made mention of $1000,
didn't you?

145
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,100
I thought I made mention of a hanging,
didn't I?

146
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,900
Five hundred dollars.

147
00:17:55,800 --> 00:18:00,700
Whiskey, if you behave,
we're gonna be rich. Real rich.

148
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,900
Whiskey.

149
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:43,700
Not you. Stay outside.

150
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,700
Leave the bottle.

151
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,900
That's an uppercut.

152
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,100
That's a left cross.

153
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,900
And that's a two-by-four.

154
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,400
Thank you.

155
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,900
Mr. Stranger...

156
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:02,900
...the evening train's coming.
I just heard the...

157
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,900
...blow.
It's at Five-Mile Crossing.

158
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:11,400
Then the train has five miles to go.
I still can finish my meal.

159
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:16,900
If you want to meet the old train
you'd better come now because...

160
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,600
...Five-Mile Crossing is only
half a mile down the t...

161
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,100
- Track?
- Way.

162
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,900
Really?

163
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,100
I'd better go.

164
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:42,400
Charming
Charming

165
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:47,100
There ain't no woman in these parts
That looks as good as you

166
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:51,500
Charming
Charming

167
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,900
Don't forget
What you were sent to do

168
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,700
Pardon me. Pardon me.

169
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,700
Would you mind taking hold of these,
please?

170
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,700
Well, yes, ma'am.

171
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,500
Wonderful.

172
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:33,600
You were the only lady
to get off the train.

173
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,900
Yes, I was.

174
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:39,100
- Then you must be Charming.
- You've said it all.

175
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,600
I mean, Charming Jones.
Parody's daughter.

176
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,900
I'm your pa's friend.
He told me to pick you up.

177
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,900
- I'm Handsome Stranger.
- Yes, you are.

178
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,100
- Let me help you.
- Thank you.

179
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,600
My!

180
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:02,700
- Shall we?
- Oh, yes. Yes.

181
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:26,400
Handsome Stranger is such
a wonderful nickname.

182
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,600
How did you get it?

183
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:31,500
It's not a nickname.
It's my real name.

184
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:36,000
- Really?
- Yes, I was named after my father.

185
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,500
He must have been quite a man.

186
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:41,900
I don't know. I never met him.

187
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,200
How did you meet my daddy?
I never heard him mention your name.

188
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,000
I met him in Denver.
He saved my life.

189
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:58,100
He nursed me
after I got beat up by ruffians.

190
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:03,100
Oh, dear. Why did they do that?

191
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,600
You know, I don't know.

192
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:09,600
But like I said,
it was a few years ago in Denver.

193
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:14,500
I saw a bunch of crazy horses
running down Main Street.

194
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:18,900
I finally realized
that these were runaways.

195
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:23,600
So I jumped on my horse
and I chased them down the street.

196
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:27,200
I ran after them.
It was crazy.

197
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:31,900
They were going faster and faster.
I was catching up with them.

198
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:36,800
There were children and women
and old men in danger in the street.

199
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000
It was really dangerous.
I tried to save them.

200
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,300
You risked your life to try
to stop them.

201
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:48,600
- I do this every day. I try to...
- Oh, how wonderful.

202
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:52,800
So I kept running after them
and finally I did catch up.

203
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,400
- What are you doing?
- I got them under control.

204
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,200
Get him off my horse.

205
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:12,500
You dummy. How am I gonna
make a living?

206
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:16,200
That was the only cathouse in town.

207
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,200
Excuse me, ma'am.
What do you do for a living?

208
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,300
And that's the way it was.

209
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:33,600
That was a brave and noble thing
you did, stopping that team of horses.

210
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:37,100
Why, you could have been killed!

211
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,500
Oh, yes.

212
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,300
There's been a change of plans.

213
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:42,200
The girl already got somebody
to ride shotgun for her.

214
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:47,100
He don't look like much, but
it won't be easy to get the money.

215
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,200
Why don't I just hold them up...?

216
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:55,100
Why don't you just do that,
if you think you can handle it?

217
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,800
What makes you think I can't?

218
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:01,600
You did such a magnificent job
on the bank.

219
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:08,300
Yeah, well, I've had a lot more
experience robbing people.

220
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,800
Make sure you get that money.

221
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:15,300
- I'll get it.
- Make sure you bring back all of it.

222
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:19,200
- I'm not dishonest.
- And I'm not a trusting man.

223
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,900
I always insure a risk.

224
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,700
You take good care of that box,
young man.

225
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,200
Charming, have a nice trip.
Say hi to your dad.

226
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,700
We could've saved
some of Daddy's money...

227
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,800
...by taking only one room.

228
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,600
Oh, no, don't worry about it.

229
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,100
I can pay for my own room.

230
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:18,400
He was waiting at the station
When the train pulled in

231
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:23,800
He was there to meet a lady
As a favour for a friend

232
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:30,800
The stranger was a proud man
Who paid the debts he owed

233
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:36,500
And it was his time to pay the debt
He owed from long ago

234
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:41,600
Handsome Stranger
Where do you come from?

235
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:45,100
No one seems to know
Your business here

236
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:50,900
With your steel- blue eyes
And pearl handled guns

237
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:54,800
There ain't an outlaw anywhere
You fear

238
00:28:56,100 --> 00:29:00,400
Handsome Stranger
Where do you come from?

239
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:04,000
No one seems to know
Your business here

240
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:09,900
With your steel- blue eyes
And pearl handled guns

241
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:13,700
There ain't an outlaw anywhere
You fear

242
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:21,700
Oh, let me straighten out the bags.
Can you hold this?

243
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:32,600
- Are you gonna be long?
- No.

244
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:36,100
- What are you doing?
- Tying down the bags.

245
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,200
Higher.

246
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,400
No.
I mean me, higher.

247
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,500
Now, was that difficult?

248
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:05,800
This is the day we strike it rich.

249
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:16,200
One, I merely step out
in front of that wagon.

250
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:25,000
That ought to stop them.
Two, I shoot the boyfriend.

251
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:32,400
Three, I steal the money
and ravish that woman.

252
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:39,300
Leaving that oily banker
with his thumb up his dumb.

253
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,700
I'll handle this.

254
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,500
- Did you hear that?
- No, I heard nothing.

255
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:33,200
There was a big sound.

256
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,500
Whiskey!

257
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:17,000
Whiskey, where you been?

258
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:37,400
Why does the banker want him watched?
He needs to be looked after.

259
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:51,400
- I've never done this before.
- You're doing a good job.

260
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,900
Oh, thank you.

261
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:58,200
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Oh, you're so welcome.

262
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:04,000
- What a relief!
- What?

263
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:07,100
We passed the bend and
nothing happened.

264
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:09,000
Yes, I know.

265
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:18,200
Whiskey!

266
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:33,800
- It sure is desolate out here.
- Yes, ma'am.

267
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:46,400
Won't it be awful if we're robbed
or attacked by bandits?

268
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,200
I hear they do
terrible things to women.

269
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:05,500
You don't talk much, do you?

270
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,200
I wish you'd make some conversation.

271
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:20,400
Otherwise, it's going to be a very,
very dull trip.

272
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:25,000
- What do you want to talk about?
- Oh, anything. Surprise me.

273
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:30,200
You want to see my gun?
Bet you've never seen one like this.

274
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,200
It's like any other gun.

275
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:39,200
It just looks like any other gun,
but it's different.

276
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,200
Oh, really?

277
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:44,500
Well, tell me.
I'm dying to know.

278
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,300
- This is a seven-shot six-shooter.
- Yeah?

279
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:51,400
And I had it specially made.

280
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,200
Why?

281
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:58,300
- Why?
- Yes, why?

282
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,200
I don't know.

283
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
- Nobody asked me that before.
- I'll bet.

284
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:56,400
Ah, I love those Latin hymns.

285
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:01,800
Welcome, stranger.
You're a handsome stranger.

286
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:07,600
I see by the guns you wear
that you're a man of violence.

287
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:13,000
Violence is ignorance.
But it's not too late to be saved.

288
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:17,100
The skies are darkening.
Soon, the rain will fall.

289
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:19,500
The angels are weeping.

290
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:23,300
Let their teardrops
cleanse your heart.

291
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:26,100
- It's not too late to be saved.
- Really?

292
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:31,000
You can be the salt of the earth,
the light of the life.

293
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,100
- But you gotta stop drinking.
- I'm not.

294
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,600
- No drinking.
- Never.

295
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:38,500
- No cussing.
- Never.

296
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:42,300
No dirty jokes.

297
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:51,000
The wicked sprung up like grass and
the works of iniquity flourished...

298
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:56,000
...it was so they might be destroyed.
Hand me your guns.

299
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:05,100
Now, if I were a mind to rob you...

300
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,600
...or perhaps
molest your lady friend...

301
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:13,800
...this gun wouldn't scare you at all.

302
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,200
Because we both know it's not loaded.

303
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:23,000
- But I want to tell you that...
- Freeze. My gun is definitely loaded.

304
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,600
Right.

305
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:28,000
If I were to pull the trigger...

306
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,800
...it wouldn't scare you.
- Reverend!

307
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:46,700
I wish he wouldn't have left so soon.

308
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:49,900
I think he really could've helped me.

309
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,000
Me too.

310
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:58,300
You and your seven-shot six-shooter.

311
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,600
Whiskey.

312
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,000
What happened?

313
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,300
Behave yourself.

314
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:51,600
Whiskey, when we steal that money,
we're gonna buy a nice spread.

315
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:57,200
With a little corral
and a couple of cute fillies for you.

316
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:03,100
I think I'll get me
a couple cute fillies too.

317
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:08,600
Now, go away.
I gotta work this out.

318
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:18,300
Yeah, this is gonna work.

319
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:39,000
I like this place.
Let's spend the night here.

320
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:41,000
Perfect.

321
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:00,000
I'll take care of the team, okay?

322
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:09,800
Charming
Charming

323
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:14,900
There ain't no woman in these parts
That looks as good as you

324
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:19,100
Charming
Charming

325
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:22,500
Don't forget
What you were sent to do

326
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:28,800
She came to town
With her head held high

327
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:34,500
Cowboys smile when she walks by

328
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:40,400
Across the badlands she does ride

329
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:46,100
With a handsome stranger
By her side

330
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:49,600
Charming

331
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:54,400
Charming

332
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:58,200
There ain't no woman
Looks as good as you

333
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,500
What's the matter?

334
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:19,000
- Do you know which way is north?
- Why?

335
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:24,800
When we stay overnight here,
we point the wagon to the North Star.

336
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:29,400
- We know in the morning where to go.
- Really?

337
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,800
I read it in one of the
pioneer magazines.

338
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:36,100
Tell you what.

339
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:41,000
If we cross the river and stay on
the road we've been on all day...

340
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:44,000
...we'll get to where we're going.

341
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:50,700
- You're right.
- You know, I think I'll take a bath.

342
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:53,300
I'll get some wood for the fire.

343
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:57,000
Would you like to scrub my back?

344
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:59,600
I'd better get the wood.

345
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:03,600
I knew he'd say that.
I knew it.

346
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:09,400
Handsome?

347
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,600
Handsome, is that you?

348
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:25,600
We should have packed a lunch.
It's gonna be a long job.

349
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:29,400
You wanna Indian wrestle?

350
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:51,200
Miss Charming?

351
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:54,200
I've been lying here
and looking at you...

352
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:57,200
...and thinking how fitting
your name is.

353
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:01,200
I mean, it really does you justice.

354
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:05,300
How did you get a name like that?

355
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:09,300
It was the first thing
that my daddy said...

356
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:12,600
...when he found out
they were going to have me.

357
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:16,800
Mama said,
"Parody, I think I'm pregnant."

358
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:21,800
And Daddy said,
"Oh, charming. Just charming."

359
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:26,300
Your dad.
He's quite a guy, I'll tell you.

360
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:34,000
Do you have a girl?

361
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:41,400
Have you ever had a girl?

362
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:44,800
I don't think so, Miss Charming.

363
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:59,400
What are you gonna do?

364
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:07,400
It's going to get cold tonight.

365
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:11,500
So I think I'm getting
some wood for the fire.

366
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:25,000
What the...?

367
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:29,200
Respect!

368
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:35,200
One of these days,
I'm gonna trade you in for a mule.

369
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:39,100
Yeah, you think you're so
goldarned smart.

370
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:43,000
I don't think that was so funny.

371
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:11,100
Whiskey!

372
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:19,500
Did you hear me?

373
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:25,800
Then what are you standing there for?

374
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:39,400
Anxious Beaver, look down there.

375
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,600
Over there.

376
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:51,200
- It's him.
- Him it is.

377
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:58,000
That's a very smart horse.

378
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:02,800
Now, that's a horse for you, Mary.

379
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:19,500
My braves!

380
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:40,400
We're gonna have a necktie party,
Mr. Handsome Stranger.

381
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:45,700
You're gonna be the guest of honour,
Mr. Handsome Stranger.

382
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:14,400
Whiskey!

383
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:20,000
Whiskey!

384
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,700
I'll tell you when.

385
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:34,900
Missed.

386
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:39,700
Rock went behind. Gonna hit the thing.
I don't get that.

387
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:05,500
It's chapter six.
"The tunnel in the hillside."

388
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:37,500
Right there.

389
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,300
Did you see that?

390
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:58,900
Oh, what do you know?

391
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:05,700
This is a shortcut.

392
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,300
Watch this.

393
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:31,700
I'll show you how to handle
these situations.

394
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:36,300
Here.

395
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:40,100
Back up.

396
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:52,700
Keep it that way.

397
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:57,700
Keep it taut.

398
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:23,800
Back up!

399
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,700
Back up!

400
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:29,300
Do you hear me?

401
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:30,100
We've got to be careful from here on.
This is Indian country.

402
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:40,300
- Indian County.
- County?

403
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:55,700
Whiskey, this book has been
fouling me up.

404
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:00,600
I don't need Jesse James.

405
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:03,500
Or Doc Holliday.

406
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:06,300
Or Billy the Kid.

407
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,100
I don't need anybody.

408
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:13,900
From now on, I do it my way.

409
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:18,100
Cactus Jack Slade.

410
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:13,600
Why does old enemy...

411
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:18,200
...Prickly Jack come to Nervous Elk?

412
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:22,900
It's Cactus Jack. Cactus Jack Slade.

413
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:27,600
I come to speak with straight tongue.

414
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:31,500
Tongue may be straight...

415
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:36,100
...but mouth hide many sharp teeth.

416
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:41,500
I seek great chief's help.
I lost my heart to a girl.

417
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:45,700
- Can't you talk without your hands?
- Yeah, well...

418
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:50,300
...this fellow that's with her
is one big mean critter.

419
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:56,500
How can this tired old warrior help?

420
01:00:57,300 --> 01:01:01,800
I was hoping that if you and me
and a bunch of these braves...

421
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,800
...were to pop out
sudden-like at him...

422
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:08,700
...he wouldn't be so likely
to start a ruckus.

423
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:15,600
You want nothing from this man...

424
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:18,000
...but woman?
- Not one thing.

425
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:20,500
Well, I'd take the buckboard.

426
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:24,100
She couldn't ride a horse
dressed like she is.

427
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:26,900
I'd even give him my horse.

428
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:30,300
I'm still willing
to do him a kindness.

429
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:35,500
Giving him that horse no kindness.

430
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:48,900
What's in it for Nervous Elk?

431
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:55,700
- Scalps.
- Scalps?

432
01:01:55,900 --> 01:02:01,900
- Come now, Many-Sticker John.
- It's Cactus Jack Slade.

433
01:02:02,100 --> 01:02:04,900
Whatever.

434
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:10,600
Scalps don't put beans on table.

435
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:15,900
I'll share the woman.

436
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:22,900
White woman crazy.

437
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:26,200
They all keep one bullet in gun.

438
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:28,200
Yeah, I heard that.

439
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:31,800
By the way, I've been meaning
to ask you...

440
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:37,100
What do you Indians do when
you capture a white woman?

441
01:02:39,100 --> 01:02:43,700
Nervous Elk not know.

442
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:50,200
Crazy white woman always shoots self
before me have chance to find out!

443
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:54,700
All except one.

444
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,800
Who, by mistake...

445
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:00,600
...shoot Nervous Elk...

446
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:03,400
...in the jewels.

447
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:07,100
Yeah, I remember.

448
01:03:07,300 --> 01:03:10,700
For old-time's sake, will you help me?

449
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:15,500
Me like nearsighted elk
that make love to cactus...

450
01:03:15,700 --> 01:03:18,300
...been stuck before.

451
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:22,000
We will help.

452
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:25,500
I knew I could count on my friend.
Thanks, chief.

453
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,700
Now what's the matter with you?

454
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:48,800
What's wrong?

455
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:53,100
I wasn't gonna give you away.

456
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:58,800
Come here. I was just saying that.

457
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,500
See you at the camp.

458
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:20,300
That man is here to steal money,
isn't he?

459
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:24,500
And if you help him,
you'll be stealing also.

460
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:28,300
But you've given your word
to the banker.

461
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:32,200
- Would you go back on it now?
- Uh-huh.

462
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:40,000
- What about that white man?
- Piss on the white man.

463
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:12,800
Listen to those drums!
It's so scary.

464
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:16,300
Don't worry. They never attack
until daylight.

465
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:18,500
Really?

466
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:26,400
Thank you.

467
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:41,600
Know what? He's gonna
set the Indian back 50 years.

468
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:47,100
I don't know which is worse,
him or those damn drums.

469
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:52,100
This is the plan of attack.
Go over it with your troops.

470
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:55,300
- Okay, chief.
- Good brave.

471
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:59,400
Well, Handsome...

472
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:04,400
...this is our last night together.
- Yeah.

473
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:09,700
Tomorrow at this time you'll be home
safe and sound with your daddy.

474
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:17,100
- I'm not really sleepy, are you?
- Oh, no, I'm wide awake.

475
01:06:17,300 --> 01:06:20,100
Good.

476
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,500
What have you got in mind?

477
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:30,300
- I know what.
- What?

478
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:35,100
- Want to hear some knock-knock jokes?
- I'll get some wood for the fire.

479
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:39,000
We attack at dawn.

480
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:43,400
Chief, why don't we attack now,
when they're off guard?

481
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:47,400
- Indians never attack till dawn.
- I know, but why?

482
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:53,500
Because at night, Indians too busy
pounding on those dumb drums!

483
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:11,300
There they are!

484
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:28,700
- What are we waiting for?
- It not dawn yet.

485
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:33,800
Until 6:28 and 45 seconds,
according to almanac.

486
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:37,200
Chief, you sure your braves
can handle this?

487
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:42,500
My people greatest light cavalry
ever mount horse!

488
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,900
- I hope so.
- It dawn!

489
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:51,600
My braves, prepare to mount!

490
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:56,700
Prepare to mount!

491
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,600
Mount!

492
01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:04,200
Mount!

493
01:08:07,100 --> 01:08:08,400
Charge!

494
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:41,000
- Chief!
- Set up field hospital!

495
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:45,200
Count casualties!
Prepare for another attack!

496
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:49,000
- Prepare for attack!
- Will you shut up?

497
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:54,800
Chief, I appreciate your help, but...

498
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:59,300
...it's not gonna work out.
- My word is bond!

499
01:08:59,500 --> 01:09:03,000
Hey, Beaver, any braves still moving?

500
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:06,300
- Yeah, chief, two.
- Good. Get mounted!

501
01:09:06,500 --> 01:09:11,300
- Get mounted!
- Four of us will continue.

502
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:17,700
No fear, Porcupine Jack.
You're in good hands.

503
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:23,100
No, it's Cactus Jack.
Cactus Jack Slade!

504
01:09:23,300 --> 01:09:26,100
Jeez, I'm gonna do it my own way.

505
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:28,500
Whiskey!

506
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:34,100
- Did anybody see my horse?
- He went thataway.

507
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:36,900
Whiskey!

508
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:44,900
Whiskey!

509
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:50,200
Thattaboy, Handsome!

510
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:52,800
Son of a gun!

511
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,600
They're gaining on us. Come on!

512
01:10:14,300 --> 01:10:16,800
Keep them between the ditches!

513
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:31,500
Yeah, you tell them! Come on, Bumper!

514
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:34,400
You're looking good! Come on, honey!

515
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:39,800
- They're getting closer, Handsome.
- I know.

516
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,900
I don't know what got them so mad.

517
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:46,700
Well, I'll tell you, I don't know.
It could be...

518
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,800
...those knock-knock jokes.
I don't know.

519
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,800
- Really?
- Really.

520
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:56,600
But I do know we're slowing down.

521
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:04,600
I think you better go a little
faster, because they're gonna get us.

522
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:08,900
I can't go any faster.
These horses are really tired.

523
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:15,300
Well, in a little ways
you're gonna be safe.

524
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:18,500
- What do you mean, ma'am?
- Trust me.

525
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,300
There it is.

526
01:11:41,900 --> 01:11:44,200
You, back over here...

527
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:46,700
...where you belong.

528
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:54,700
- That was pretty close, chief.
- Close not good enough.

529
01:11:54,900 --> 01:12:00,300
Well, braves, back to bead-stringing.

530
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:03,200
Bye-bye, chief. Maybe next time!

531
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:14,100
And I got all dressed up for nothing.

532
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:23,100
On tiptoe.

533
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:42,500
Stop.

534
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:06,700
Whiskey?

535
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:08,900
Whiskey?

536
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:16,300
Whiskey!

537
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:24,500
Excuse me, ma'am?

538
01:19:24,700 --> 01:19:29,200
Isn't it dangerous to have
blasting powder in the house?

539
01:19:29,300 --> 01:19:31,300
I really don't care.

540
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:40,900
We got 'em.

541
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,600
I don't need your help.

542
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:05,600
Whiskey, you've got
a funny sense of humour.

543
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:15,300
What did you do in there?

544
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:22,700
Take another step,
and I'll ventilate you.

545
01:20:26,700 --> 01:20:30,100
Nobody outsmarts Cactus Jack Slade.

546
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:34,500
Hold it.

547
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:40,100
Like the man said, just hold it.

548
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:55,000
Exactly what are your intentions?

549
01:20:55,300 --> 01:20:57,400
To see that justice is done.

550
01:21:00,300 --> 01:21:02,400
And yours?

551
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:04,200
Blow his head off.

552
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:07,700
- Steal the money.
- And?

553
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:13,600
Then I'm gonna ravish you.

554
01:21:16,700 --> 01:21:19,500
Handsome, you lose.

555
01:21:20,600 --> 01:21:25,200
What's his name here just outbid you.
