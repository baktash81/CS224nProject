1
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:50,473
This is a story about two men.

2
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:53,379
One named Gale Sayers,
the other, Brian Piccolo.

3
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,554
They came from different parts
of the country.

4
00:00:55,789 --> 00:01:00,192
They competed for the same job.
One was white, the other black.

5
00:01:00,427 --> 00:01:03,692
One liked to talk a lot,
the other was shy as a 3-year-old.

6
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,660
Our story's about how
they came to know each other...

7
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,994
...fight each other
and help each other.

8
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:15,999
Ernest Hemingway said that
every true story ends in death.

9
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:17,607
This is a true story.

10
00:01:17,844 --> 00:01:19,607
Yo! Heads up!

11
00:01:23,716 --> 00:01:24,808
Here you go.

12
00:01:25,051 --> 00:01:26,245
Thanks.

13
00:01:32,158 --> 00:01:33,056
Gale Sayers?

14
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:40,828
Brian Piccolo. We met up in Buffalo
in that All-American game last June.

15
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:44,896
Sorry, I didn't remember.
I'm not good at that stuff.

16
00:01:46,172 --> 00:01:49,039
Oh, golly, that's all right.

17
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:52,210
I can see how you might forget,
but I sure couldn't.

18
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:54,208
That was a heck of a talk we had.

19
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:58,816
I said, "I'm Brian Piccolo. I hear
we'll both be playing for the Bears."

20
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:00,815
And you said...
I'll never forget it.

21
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:04,319
You said, "Uh-huh."
Just like that. "Uh-huh."

22
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:08,183
Whenever I'm feeling
kind of low and depressed...

23
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:10,123
...well, I think about that advice.

24
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:12,797
A lot of guys wouldn't
have talked to me, but not you.

25
00:02:13,032 --> 00:02:15,830
You just said, "Uh-huh."
Just like that. Right out.

26
00:02:18,371 --> 00:02:19,395
Uh-huh.

27
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:22,735
Where do I check in?

28
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:26,010
That building over there.
That's where Halas is.

29
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:39,654
Did you ever meet him before?

30
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,560
Talked to him
on the phone a few times.

31
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:45,460
Yeah, well...

32
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:48,891
Look, let me give you
a little hint, all right?

33
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:50,693
See, he's...

34
00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:52,766
He's a good guy and all that...

35
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,497
...but he's a little deaf
in his left ear...

36
00:02:55,742 --> 00:02:57,607
...and a little too vain to admit it.

37
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:01,371
So you gotta stand on his right side
if you want him to hear you.

38
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:05,647
Okay, thanks.

39
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:08,615
You bet.
Rookies gotta stick together.

40
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:45,817
Pardon me. Can you tell me where
I can find Coach Halas' office?

41
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,185
Thank you.

42
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:02,968
Come in.

43
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:08,437
Well, Sayers.

44
00:04:09,515 --> 00:04:10,641
I'm George Halas.

45
00:04:10,883 --> 00:04:13,716
Yeah, I know. I mean,
everyone knows who you are.

46
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:16,513
You're in time to give me
a hand with this thing.

47
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:18,815
My good-luck picture.

48
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:21,959
That's the first professional team
I ever played on.

49
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:24,720
The Decatur Staleys in 1920.

50
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,133
How's your leg?

51
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:30,362
I understand where you...

52
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,734
- I understand you hurt it.
- It's fine. 100%.

53
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:37,169
And your head?

54
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:40,743
My head? There's nothing
wrong with my head.

55
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:41,844
Good.

56
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:45,073
Being in that All-Star game
put you three weeks behind.

57
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:49,217
- Ain't gonna be easy.
- NFL ain't supposed to be easy.

58
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:51,118
That's right.

59
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,983
Well, all I can promise you
is a fair shot.

60
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:57,956
But you're gonna have
a lot of company.

61
00:04:58,231 --> 00:05:01,325
Jon Arnett, Ralph Kurek,
Brian Piccolo.

62
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,963
There's gonna be plenty...

63
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:07,663
Gonna be plenty crowded out there.

64
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:11,576
A fair shot is all I want.
Can't ask for more than that.

65
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:15,971
We plan using our backs
as receivers this year.

66
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:18,243
Did you do much...?

67
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:23,183
Did you do much pass catching
when you were in college?

68
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,814
Yes, sir, I did.

69
00:05:26,392 --> 00:05:28,292
Usually, safety-valve stuff.

70
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:30,894
Well, I like to keep
my backs in a pattern.

71
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:34,622
Unless the other team's blitzing.
You'll have to watch for that.

72
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:38,030
Those linebackers. You gotta
make sure they're not coming in.

73
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:41,638
- I know, especially with teams...
- What the hell are you doing?

74
00:05:41,874 --> 00:05:43,068
I don't know what you mean.

75
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:46,745
I know you got moves, but you
don't have to show them to me now.

76
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:50,039
You're bouncing around here
like a pauper in a pay toilet.

77
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:54,284
Well, I was just trying to get on
the side of your good ear.

78
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:58,055
What are you talking about,
"good ear"?

79
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:04,727
Brian Piccolo said that...

80
00:06:06,165 --> 00:06:07,655
He said...

81
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:22,541
Hey, Sayers.

82
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:26,650
We'll have to stop meeting like this.
My wife's getting suspicious.

83
00:06:33,192 --> 00:06:34,659
Hold it down!

84
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:39,293
Some of you cats
that pulled in today...

85
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:42,257
...haven't heard
what will be expected.

86
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:44,470
So hold it down and let me talk.

87
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:47,969
You new guys will get
a playbook tomorrow.

88
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,208
It's like the Bible.

89
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:52,639
You lose your playbook,
it's gonna cost you $1000.

90
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:55,342
I heard this thing twice
already today.

91
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,674
Lose your playbook,
it'd cost a $1000.

92
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:00,613
Lose it twice, they feed
your foot to the defense.

93
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:02,582
Would you cool it, please?

94
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:05,052
I'm just trying to be helpful.

95
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:07,623
- Well, I don't need your...
- Mr. Sayers!

96
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:17,628
I mentioned the fine for talking at
a meeting. You hear what I said?

97
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:22,732
No, I did not.

98
00:07:22,975 --> 00:07:26,843
The fine for talking at a team
meeting, Mr. Sayers, is $25.

99
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:29,570
And it's just been laid on you.
Can you dig that?

100
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:32,808
Yeah.

101
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:40,718
Sorry, man.

102
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:51,963
Hold up.

103
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:56,469
It was brought to my attention that
unless Sayers was saying his beads...

104
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:59,109
...it might be fair
if Mr. Piccolo would sing a song.

105
00:07:59,345 --> 00:08:01,575
Say, like, maybe a fight song.

106
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:03,748
Wake Forest, right, Mr. Piccolo?

107
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:06,948
That's right.

108
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:14,455
You can't let it get to you.
It's just a question of style.

109
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:16,252
Style, I say.

110
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,797
Excuse me.

111
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:25,265
Oh, here's to Wake Forest

112
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:29,464
A glass of the finest Red Ruddy
Rhenish filled up to the brim

113
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:34,277
Her sons, they are many
Unrivaled by any

114
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,948
With hearts o'erflowing
They will sing a hymn

115
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:39,576
Rah! Rah! Rah!

116
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:41,548
Wake Forest, rah!

117
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:44,221
Old alma mater's sons we are

118
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:48,492
We'll herald the story
And die for her glory

119
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:52,220
Old Black and Gold is ever waving high

120
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:18,213
All right.
Let's go to 10 nice and loud.

121
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:20,049
Start off slowly.
Ready. Exercise.

122
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:23,751
One, two, three.
One, two, three.

123
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:28,528
Dig! Dig! What's wrong
with you? You're not trying!

124
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:31,430
You're not trying.
You make me sick!

125
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:37,302
We're loaning you those uniforms.
Don't you know that?

126
00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:40,512
We'll let you keep them as long as
you play like Chicago Bears.

127
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:44,512
But the minute you start tiptoeing
around, we're gonna want them back.

128
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,877
42-trap, Sayers up.

129
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:49,519
Way to go! Way to go, Gale!

130
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:51,753
That's more like it.

131
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:54,391
Good execution, Charley.
That's it.

132
00:09:57,697 --> 00:09:59,096
Two-ninety-two!

133
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:00,822
Set, hut!

134
00:10:07,573 --> 00:10:08,904
Ready, set...

135
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:09,937
...go!

136
00:10:19,685 --> 00:10:21,516
Ready, set, go!

137
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,561
I think it's working.

138
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:38,526
What's working?

139
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:41,235
I'm getting you overconfident.

140
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:52,215
Plant. You gotta plant your
right foot, boy. That's dumb.

141
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,628
Just practicing the halfback option.

142
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:10,493
I haven't got the lock that
you have on making the team...

143
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:14,137
...and Halas said that they're gonna
use that option a lot this year.

144
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:16,864
And it's not one of
my strong points, understand?

145
00:11:19,378 --> 00:11:21,073
Try going to your left.

146
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:25,784
They don't look for a right-handed
guy to throw, going to his left.

147
00:11:26,585 --> 00:11:27,449
I will, thanks.

148
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:33,615
Hey, Sayers.
I did say, "Thank you."

149
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:36,383
I know.

150
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:40,024
Well, that usually calls
for a response like:

151
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,626
"You're welcome,"
or "How's your mother?"

152
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:44,633
"How's your mother?"

153
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:46,969
She's fine. Thank you for asking.

154
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:50,335
You're welcome.

155
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,417
Hut! Hut!

156
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,124
Okay, first cut.

157
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:13,395
Where do we start?

158
00:12:13,632 --> 00:12:14,530
Backfield.

159
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:15,893
- Fenne4?
- Cut.

160
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:17,693
- Daniels?
- Cut.

161
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:19,231
Sayers?

162
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:20,871
Are you kidding?

163
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:21,903
Charles?

164
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:25,201
Shoot him. Justifiable homicide.

165
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:26,843
What about Piccolo?

166
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:30,640
He's too slow and he's too light,
but he hangs in like a terrier.

167
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:33,044
Let's keep him till the final cut.

168
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:36,819
Hut! Hut! Hut!

169
00:12:45,831 --> 00:12:49,232
Piccolo, you bonehead,
that was fake draw, screen right!

170
00:12:49,468 --> 00:12:52,960
What the hell do you do on
fake draw, screen right?

171
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:56,868
On a fake draw, screen right,
I pick up a linebacker if he's coming.

172
00:12:57,109 --> 00:13:00,977
Unless it's Butkus, then I notify
the quarterback to send for a priest.

173
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,912
All right, knock it off.
Don't encourage him.

174
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,344
Let's run that again.

175
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:06,812
Let's go. Come on.

176
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:08,485
We're not holding this man up.

177
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:11,155
I know we're not,
that's why we're here.

178
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:14,120
Don't tell me about the fool,
because I was there!

179
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,760
You talk like I'm blind!
Come in.

180
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:18,327
I saw him.

181
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:22,161
But he's not giving him pressure.
He didn't at the time.

182
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:23,527
Hello, Gale.

183
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:26,329
Come on in, sit down.

184
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:28,935
You know Ed McCaskey. J.C.

185
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:30,870
I'll call you back, all right?

186
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,737
You want some iced tea?

187
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:34,945
Yeah, please.

188
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:37,015
There you go.

189
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:47,184
I'll tell you what we wanted
to talk to you about.

190
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:53,095
Well, I'm an old-timer
in a lot of ways.

191
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:57,034
At least that's what
some people keep telling me.

192
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:02,570
But I don't think it's all that
common for a man of my age to...

193
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:06,110
...be used to the way things are.

194
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,142
To be comfortable with things.

195
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:15,214
What it comes down to is
that J.C. Had a notion here...

196
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:18,456
...and Ed seems to think
it's a good idea.

197
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,384
And I guess we are due for
some changes around here.

198
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:25,689
You want me to play flanker,
not running back.

199
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:27,057
No, no, no.

200
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:29,833
It's not that simple, Gale.

201
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:33,436
J.C.'s idea, and yes,
I did agree with him...

202
00:14:34,473 --> 00:14:36,964
...'cause that this is 1965.

203
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,939
We'd like the Bears to room
together according to position...

204
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:41,578
...without any regard to race.

205
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:46,746
So we'd like you and Brian Piccolo
to room together.

206
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:53,085
That's all?
That's what this is about?

207
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:54,417
Is that all?

208
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:58,790
Yeah! You had me worried.
I thought it was something really...

209
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:00,430
This is something "really"

210
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:04,932
A white man and a black man rooming
together hasn't been done before.

211
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:07,831
You're gonna be called
a "Tom" by some blacks...

212
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:10,371
...and "uppity nigger" by some whites.

213
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:13,305
When we go on the road,
I'm talking about Atlanta...

214
00:15:13,545 --> 00:15:16,912
...Houston, Miami, New Orleans...

215
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:20,585
...it ain't gonna be no better in
Detroit, Minnesota or San Francisco...

216
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:22,184
...or any other town.

217
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:26,991
You're gonna rock the boat, and
people out there are already seasick.

218
00:15:27,993 --> 00:15:31,485
What J.C. Is saying is that
there may be some pressures.

219
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:33,322
Severe ones.

220
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:37,868
What do you say?

221
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:01,020
You and me are rooming together.

222
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,687
- Says who?
- Who else?

223
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:07,925
That's terrific.

224
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:12,900
It's a shame he couldn't ask me
how I feel, isn't it?

225
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,070
You want me out?

226
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:21,234
I don't want you out, stay.
I guess I'm just...

227
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:25,348
...steamed at the old man for not
putting me in the scrimmage today.

228
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,217
Is that your wife?

229
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:33,586
She's pretty.

230
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,987
So is yours, and the little girl.

231
00:16:36,228 --> 00:16:37,354
Thanks.

232
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:41,823
Supposed to call her tonight...

233
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:43,796
...tell her how I'm going.

234
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:48,701
That might be the shortest
phone call in history.

235
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:50,101
Maybe not.

236
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,069
Pic...

237
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:57,643
...they wouldn't room us together
unless we both made the team.

238
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,124
That's right.

239
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:22,471
- Let's go call our wives.
- Wait a minute, I just called!

240
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:27,339
- Come on, man!
- Out you go.

241
00:17:32,851 --> 00:17:35,479
Congratulations on making
the team, gentlemen.

242
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:36,684
Well done.

243
00:17:36,922 --> 00:17:39,914
Coach Halas kind of frowns
on the hazing of new men.

244
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:43,651
But now that you've made the team,
it's like you're one of us.

245
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:48,159
Welcome to the Chicago Bears!

246
00:17:59,978 --> 00:18:04,347
Pass from Concannon to Sayers,
complete for a touchdown for the Bears.

247
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:32,010
Is playing in the NFL any easier
than you thought it'd be?

248
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:34,610
My first game.
Not exactly an expert.

249
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:36,974
J.C. Says he hasn't seen
anyone carry the ball...

250
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:39,878
...for the Bears like that
since Willie Galimore.

251
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,177
The blocks were there.

252
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,214
That's not what you said last night.

253
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:49,018
You called the offensive line
the "seven blocks of Silly Putty."

254
00:18:50,762 --> 00:18:52,525
You're Brian Piccolo.

255
00:18:52,764 --> 00:18:57,565
Yes, sir, that's right.
Piccolo. P-l-C-C-O-L-O.

256
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:01,295
You two are the only black and white
player rooming together on the team.

257
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,337
Any problems so far?

258
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:05,876
Not as long as he doesn't
use the bathroom.

259
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,139
Pic!

260
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:22,149
Hey, Gale, when you run...

261
00:19:22,394 --> 00:19:25,625
...do you think about what
you're doing, or you just do it?

262
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:27,331
I just do it.

263
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,793
Start thinking about it, will you?

264
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:31,730
I want to play some too.

265
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:38,971
I save it.
Anyway, so...

266
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:43,040
Concannon calls this trap play.
You know what a trap play is?

267
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:44,945
I think so.

268
00:19:48,253 --> 00:19:51,086
A trap play is when all
the linemen go one way...

269
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:54,258
...and hopefully, the defense goes
the same way. If they do...

270
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:56,961
...it's a big hole.
If they don't, it's bad news.

271
00:19:57,629 --> 00:20:00,655
Anyway, Concannon calls
this trap play...

272
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:03,333
...and it's beautiful.
43 yards, wasn't it?

273
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:07,733
And Halas sees he's tired...

274
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:10,203
...and sends me in.
I go in and he comes out.

275
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:12,672
Concannon then figures
he's gonna get foxy.

276
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:14,674
You know, Concannon is...

277
00:20:17,182 --> 00:20:18,774
Well, he says, "Same play."

278
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:21,111
Very same play.

279
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:24,653
Trap play is also called
a "sucker play"...

280
00:20:24,923 --> 00:20:27,517
...because it makes the defense
look bad when it works.

281
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:32,059
And defenses do not like to look
real bad. Makes them kind of surly.

282
00:20:32,497 --> 00:20:34,328
All the linemen go this way...

283
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:38,468
...and it's like I'm looking at a team
portrait of the Los Angeles Rams.

284
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:42,299
Hey, Deacon? Merlin?
How's the family, Rosey?

285
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:46,837
I was afraid to get up, that
not everything would come with me.

286
00:20:47,112 --> 00:20:50,843
You've never seen anyone
so black-and-blue in your life!

287
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:55,477
It's like I'm rooming
with a colored player again.

288
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,014
Gale told a joke.

289
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:05,522
The stone-face from Kansas speaks.

290
00:21:05,897 --> 00:21:08,866
All right!
Hey, Chicago! Chicago!

291
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,399
Sayers speaks! He speaks!

292
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:14,100
Hey, Black Magic?

293
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:16,238
Listen to this letter I got.

294
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:21,411
"You must have been raised with pigs
to room with one of those darkies.

295
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:25,139
You must not have been taught
anything when you were a boy.

296
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:28,353
You must have crawled out
from under some slimy rock."

297
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:30,486
Is that all?

298
00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:33,384
Except the usual: "Love, Mother."

299
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:38,361
Magic.

300
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:42,227
- I'm gonna write you a speech.
- What kind of speech?

301
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:45,925
An acceptance speech for
Rookie of the Year. You can't miss.

302
00:21:46,171 --> 00:21:49,402
I gotta give a speech?
No way.

303
00:21:51,943 --> 00:21:55,640
The man we're honoring tonight
was a two-time All-American.

304
00:21:55,881 --> 00:21:59,715
He was the top draft choice
of the Chicago Bears of 1965...

305
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:04,149
...and three times, during the season,
he gained 100 or more yards.

306
00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:06,949
Perhaps his best
individual performance...

307
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:09,217
All right, go ahead.
From the top.

308
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:11,520
I want to thank you all
for this honor...

309
00:22:11,763 --> 00:22:15,460
...but I really think it's not right
to give it to one man.

310
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:19,927
Football is a team sport and...

311
00:22:22,407 --> 00:22:24,568
Start from the top. Look up.

312
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:25,606
Gale Sayers.

313
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:08,008
I'd like to thank you all
for this honor...

314
00:23:08,286 --> 00:23:10,015
...though it's not really right...

315
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:33,572
Thank you.

316
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:38,713
Who'd believe it?

317
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:43,755
I mean, who would ever believe it?

318
00:23:46,725 --> 00:23:47,817
Dumb.

319
00:23:50,562 --> 00:23:53,725
All right, let's go.
On the line: Davis, Turner.

320
00:23:55,133 --> 00:23:56,327
Ready...

321
00:23:56,568 --> 00:23:58,468
...set, go!

322
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:00,765
Spinny, Lyle!

323
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:03,673
Ready...

324
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:06,139
...set, go!

325
00:24:06,745 --> 00:24:08,736
O'Bradovich, Caroline!

326
00:24:09,681 --> 00:24:12,878
Hey, Abe. Since when does
a lineman have to race a halfback?

327
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:16,519
- Race against the clock, not me.
- I still ought to have a handicap.

328
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:20,282
You said the defensive backfield
was your handicap all last year, O.B.

329
00:24:20,525 --> 00:24:22,493
Shut up, Pic.
You're still a rookie to me.

330
00:24:22,727 --> 00:24:24,752
Cut it out.
Pic, get back in line.

331
00:24:24,996 --> 00:24:26,657
Ready, set...

332
00:24:29,935 --> 00:24:31,903
- Did you just get in?
- Yeah.

333
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:36,039
I would have been in earlier,
but my plane got fogged in in Detroit.

334
00:24:38,443 --> 00:24:39,535
You're in good shape.

335
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:42,144
Worked hard all winter.
Did you talk to Linda?

336
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:43,574
No, why?

337
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:46,010
I thought you heard.
Joy's expecting again.

338
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:47,047
That's great.

339
00:24:47,285 --> 00:24:49,344
If it's a boy,
we'd like to name it after you.

340
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:52,352
- No kidding.
- Got a real nice ring to it.

341
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:54,117
Spade Piccolo.

342
00:24:59,064 --> 00:25:00,497
Last season is history.

343
00:25:00,732 --> 00:25:03,701
You're gonna run and hit
and hurt and run some more.

344
00:25:03,935 --> 00:25:05,163
All right, let's go.

345
00:25:05,403 --> 00:25:07,530
42-trap, Piccolo up.

346
00:25:11,276 --> 00:25:12,971
Brian, that's the way to go!

347
00:25:13,578 --> 00:25:15,842
See, Sayers, that's why
you'll never make it.

348
00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:17,548
Pizza has magical properties...

349
00:25:17,782 --> 00:25:20,615
...that give Italians
a lot of strength and speed.

350
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:22,649
A lot of great Italian
running backs...

351
00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:26,585
That's right, there are. There's
Leroy Kellian, Lenny Moorinelli.

352
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:28,383
- Hey, J.C.
- Hey, babe.

353
00:25:28,627 --> 00:25:30,492
Is that Sunday's lineup?

354
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:33,857
- What's the backfield?
- Concannon, Ralph Kurek...

355
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:35,225
...and you.

356
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:49,036
Well, come on, Magic.
Pizza's gonna get cold.

357
00:25:55,654 --> 00:25:57,884
Play pass, be alive!

358
00:25:58,456 --> 00:25:59,923
Be alive!

359
00:26:00,158 --> 00:26:02,922
Everybody, get it in.
Come on, let's go there.

360
00:26:04,763 --> 00:26:06,355
You got him. You got him now!

361
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:19,772
Bears' ball. First and 10 on
the San Francisco 42-yard line.

362
00:26:20,111 --> 00:26:21,043
Come on, Bobby, let's go!

363
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,679
All right, let's go, Bobby!
Let's go!

364
00:26:24,716 --> 00:26:26,377
Yours, Gale. 28-toss.

365
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:28,017
On three.

366
00:26:28,486 --> 00:26:30,613
That's good. Come on.

367
00:27:37,055 --> 00:27:38,784
- Let me help you.
- No.

368
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:24,758
- It's just so good to have you home.
- Yeah, it's good to be home.

369
00:28:25,804 --> 00:28:27,101
Can I get you anything?

370
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:30,731
Nope. I'm fine.

371
00:28:41,352 --> 00:28:44,253
It's almost lunchtime.
Would you like a sandwich?

372
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:46,347
I'm not hungry. You go ahead.

373
00:28:50,528 --> 00:28:53,497
I left the kids at Joy's,
so I'd better go pick them up.

374
00:28:55,433 --> 00:28:57,264
- Will you be all right?
- Yeah.

375
00:28:57,502 --> 00:28:58,298
You sure?

376
00:28:58,536 --> 00:29:00,936
Yes, I'm sure.

377
00:29:27,065 --> 00:29:31,968
Her sons, they are many
Unrivaled by any

378
00:29:32,403 --> 00:29:35,133
With hearts o'erflowing
They will sing a hymn

379
00:29:35,974 --> 00:29:39,967
Rah! Rah! Wake Forest, rah!

380
00:29:40,178 --> 00:29:42,078
Old alma mater's sons we are...

381
00:29:42,313 --> 00:29:43,712
Is that you, Magic?

382
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:47,282
Yes, it is.
Thought you'd never get here.

383
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:50,181
- What are you doing here?
- That is not a bad act.

384
00:29:50,421 --> 00:29:52,184
But "Peg Leg" Bates does it better.

385
00:29:52,524 --> 00:29:54,549
What is that thing supposed to be?

386
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:57,493
That's not supposed to be
anything than what it is...

387
00:29:57,729 --> 00:29:59,526
...which is a leg-lift machine.

388
00:29:59,764 --> 00:30:01,163
- Well, what for?
- What for?

389
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:07,428
Getting that knee back in shape
won't be a take-it-easy proposition.

390
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:11,774
If you're afraid, I mean,
that's understandable.

391
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:15,142
I'm not afraid.

392
00:30:28,693 --> 00:30:29,955
You ought to be afraid.

393
00:30:30,195 --> 00:30:34,325
I'm not afraid. I'm just tired of
being bugged by reporters, Linda, you!

394
00:30:34,566 --> 00:30:37,694
You know, you are a real charmer.
An absolute saint.

395
00:30:37,936 --> 00:30:39,403
Maybe you think it's friendly...

396
00:30:39,637 --> 00:30:42,902
You can stick that in your ditty
bag too, you dumb jackass.

397
00:30:46,377 --> 00:30:48,345
You know, Gale...

398
00:30:49,814 --> 00:30:52,681
...when I was in high school...

399
00:30:54,719 --> 00:30:56,949
...I was one of the best backs
in the state.

400
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:59,349
Unfortunately for me...

401
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:02,287
...the best back in the state,
Tucker Frederickson...

402
00:31:02,894 --> 00:31:04,452
...went to the same school.

403
00:31:05,163 --> 00:31:08,257
The colleges used to come down
and watch us play.

404
00:31:08,499 --> 00:31:11,559
Old Tuck, he wound up at Auburn...

405
00:31:11,803 --> 00:31:13,930
...and I wound up at Wake Forest.

406
00:31:14,172 --> 00:31:15,503
Good school. Nice place...

407
00:31:17,342 --> 00:31:20,607
...but not exactly center ring,
you understand?

408
00:31:23,982 --> 00:31:26,815
I worked my tail off at Forest.

409
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:28,985
In my senior year...

410
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:32,682
...I led the nation
in rushing and scoring.

411
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:37,460
I mean, I led the entire nation.

412
00:31:38,596 --> 00:31:43,124
So I go look for a pro team,
and I pick the Bears.

413
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:47,966
Now who else comes to the Bears?
Mr. Sayers.

414
00:31:48,206 --> 00:31:50,640
Big gun from a big school.

415
00:31:50,875 --> 00:31:53,070
I'm number two all over again.

416
00:31:56,481 --> 00:31:58,039
Well, old buddy...

417
00:31:58,283 --> 00:32:00,274
...l'm number one guy now...

418
00:32:00,785 --> 00:32:02,719
...but for all the wrong reasons.

419
00:32:04,055 --> 00:32:06,683
Unless you come back 100 percent...

420
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:08,825
...people are gonna say:

421
00:32:09,661 --> 00:32:11,322
"Piccolo got in on a pass.

422
00:32:12,964 --> 00:32:15,660
Lucky break."
I don't want it like that.

423
00:32:16,334 --> 00:32:18,393
I'm gonna whip you, Sayers.

424
00:32:19,537 --> 00:32:22,904
But you gotta be at your best,
or it won't mean a thing.

425
00:32:23,141 --> 00:32:27,601
You're not gonna be one second
slower or one degree weaker.

426
00:32:30,415 --> 00:32:33,907
I am gonna work your tail off
to get that leg back in shape...

427
00:32:34,152 --> 00:32:36,985
...for my sake. You got that?

428
00:32:50,835 --> 00:32:54,271
Now for sports. In Los Angeles,
the Chicago Bears trimmed the Rams...

429
00:32:54,505 --> 00:32:56,405
...by a score of 17-16.

430
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:59,474
Quarterback Jack Concannon
was 8 for 14 passing...

431
00:32:59,711 --> 00:33:02,544
...and the running game was ably
manned by Brian Piccolo...

432
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:05,374
...who gained 105 yards
in 14 carries.

433
00:33:05,616 --> 00:33:07,379
Piccolo was awarded the game ball.

434
00:33:07,618 --> 00:33:11,281
Also on the West Coast,
the San Francisco 49ers...

435
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:21,294
- Hello?
- Dr. Fox? This is Brian Piccolo.

436
00:33:21,566 --> 00:33:23,898
- How's he doing?
- Pretty well, Brian, I think.

437
00:33:24,135 --> 00:33:27,536
Though it's boring going through
those exercises by yourself.

438
00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:29,763
It's drudgery and it's painful.

439
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:33,273
A lot of people give up
when they're alone in that situation.

440
00:33:41,886 --> 00:33:44,252
Four. That's good, babe.

441
00:33:48,092 --> 00:33:49,525
Five.

442
00:33:51,095 --> 00:33:51,891
No way.

443
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:54,098
Now don't bone me, man, come on.

444
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:56,766
Hang tough. Five more
and that's it for the night.

445
00:33:57,502 --> 00:34:00,062
Five more. Come on, get tough.

446
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:01,968
That's six.

447
00:34:04,475 --> 00:34:05,567
Seven.

448
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:08,841
Get it up. Eight.

449
00:34:09,647 --> 00:34:11,842
No way. No way.

450
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:15,686
- I can't.
- Can't make it?

451
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:18,746
Nigger. Chicken nigger.

452
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:23,256
Pic, don't make me laugh, please!

453
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:34,898
"I know what I'll do.
I'll call Gale a nigger...

454
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:38,438
...and he'll do all them reps.
He'll be so mad."

455
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:40,568
It's too much!

456
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,638
Nigger, nigger!

457
00:34:50,054 --> 00:34:52,454
Lay off. What am I supposed
to do, call you a wop?

458
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:54,749
Now that would make me mad.

459
00:34:58,963 --> 00:35:00,692
What are you guys doing?

460
00:35:01,699 --> 00:35:03,860
You wouldn't believe it, baby...

461
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:07,731
...but Brian tried
to call me a nigger!

462
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:22,919
First man to the stand for a beer?

463
00:35:23,187 --> 00:35:24,916
- All right?
- You're on.

464
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:50,932
I think I owe you a beer.

465
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:54,871
I think...

466
00:36:56,447 --> 00:36:59,507
...I owe you a lot more than that.

467
00:37:05,122 --> 00:37:06,749
Two beers, please.

468
00:37:10,294 --> 00:37:11,318
You're healthy.

469
00:37:20,204 --> 00:37:23,002
You think training camp
is some kind of a country club?

470
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:24,469
Is that what you think?

471
00:37:24,709 --> 00:37:26,973
Because no man's assured
of a job around here.

472
00:37:27,211 --> 00:37:30,146
And if you think you are,
you've got another thing coming.

473
00:37:30,381 --> 00:37:31,279
Get them up!

474
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:33,710
Get them up! Get them up!

475
00:37:33,951 --> 00:37:36,010
Come on, Pic. Come on, Pic.
Get them up.

476
00:37:36,654 --> 00:37:38,349
Come on, Billy, lift them up.

477
00:37:58,876 --> 00:37:59,968
Come in.

478
00:38:04,649 --> 00:38:07,083
- Hey, Brian.
- Oh, hello, coach.

479
00:38:07,485 --> 00:38:10,318
- Mind if I come in?
- Oh, no, not at all.

480
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:13,218
Gale, how's the knee?

481
00:38:13,491 --> 00:38:15,584
Fine. Real strong.

482
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:19,893
Excuse me, coach, if you want
to talk to Gale here, I'll just...

483
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:22,759
No, actually I want to talk
to the both of you.

484
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:27,537
Well, how things look
this year, coach?

485
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:30,035
Good. Real good.

486
00:38:30,274 --> 00:38:32,765
Matter of fact, there's one boy
I'm very impressed with.

487
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:37,447
I wouldn't be surprised to see him
replace you as number two halfback.

488
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:42,342
Because I'm gonna make you
number one fullback.

489
00:38:43,287 --> 00:38:48,190
Hey, Pic! You and me, starting
backfield. What do you say?

490
00:38:52,363 --> 00:38:54,888
Coach, I didn't think
it was possible...

491
00:38:55,132 --> 00:38:57,965
...but you finally found
a way to shut him up.

492
00:39:15,986 --> 00:39:17,715
Touchdown, Piccolo.

493
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:31,967
Sixty yards and a touchdown
for Gale Sayers.

494
00:39:33,003 --> 00:39:34,163
- Hey, Pic?
- Yo.

495
00:39:34,405 --> 00:39:36,566
You know you got
a 4.3 rushing average?

496
00:39:36,807 --> 00:39:39,503
No, but hum a few bars,
and I'll see if I can fake it.

497
00:39:39,744 --> 00:39:41,507
Oh, Pic!

498
00:39:44,582 --> 00:39:46,573
Touchdown, Piccolo.

499
00:40:03,134 --> 00:40:04,795
Two hundred and forty-one.

500
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,196
Holloway.

501
00:40:09,273 --> 00:40:11,400
Holloway: 251.

502
00:40:11,642 --> 00:40:13,633
- Piccolo.
- Big Abe.

503
00:40:14,178 --> 00:40:16,146
Scrimmage gonna teach us
new trick plays?

504
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:20,316
Only trick I'd give you is how to keep
meat on. You're down another pound.

505
00:40:20,551 --> 00:40:22,041
What's there is all choice.

506
00:40:22,453 --> 00:40:24,887
2061/4. Skinniest fullback
in the league.

507
00:40:25,122 --> 00:40:28,182
What's the matter with you?
You sweat all the fat off of us...

508
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:31,190
...then complain we're too thin.
You're hard to please.

509
00:40:31,629 --> 00:40:33,096
Get out of here.

510
00:40:34,465 --> 00:40:35,693
Sayers.

511
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:40,369
Tell your Italian buddy
to load up on the pasta.

512
00:40:40,738 --> 00:40:42,205
Maybe he wants to be quicker.

513
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,568
Ten pounds lighter. A half a second
slower in a 40-yard sprint.

514
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:47,209
It ain't working.

515
00:40:48,646 --> 00:40:51,308
Come on, Brian, hit that hole!
Hit it!

516
00:40:51,549 --> 00:40:53,244
What's wrong with you, Piccolo?

517
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:59,287
Listen, Gale, is he really hurting?
He's gotta move.

518
00:40:59,523 --> 00:41:00,490
He's not hitting!

519
00:41:00,724 --> 00:41:02,055
Come on, baby, we gotta get it!

520
00:41:07,832 --> 00:41:09,299
Come on, baby, come on!

521
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,730
- Nice block.
- Thanks.

522
00:41:47,438 --> 00:41:50,271
There must be 90 million pounds
of pollen in the air.

523
00:42:00,317 --> 00:42:04,048
You ought to get Dr. Fox to give you
something for that hay fever.

524
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:10,451
He did. The only thing
I'm allergic to is Nitschke.

525
00:42:11,262 --> 00:42:12,820
Come on, stick it in their ear!

526
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:24,136
Good game.

527
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:25,603
Looking at you...

528
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:28,371
...l'd never know we won the game.

529
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:35,749
I don't feel very much
like a winner about now.

530
00:42:35,986 --> 00:42:37,146
Why not?

531
00:42:38,455 --> 00:42:41,549
Gale, I'm sending Brian Piccolo
back to Chicago.

532
00:42:41,792 --> 00:42:44,317
He's not gonna finish
the road trip with us.

533
00:42:45,529 --> 00:42:47,895
Ralph Kurek's gonna start next week.

534
00:42:48,699 --> 00:42:50,030
But why?

535
00:42:50,301 --> 00:42:53,361
Because I've always had a policy
on this team from the start.

536
00:42:53,604 --> 00:42:56,232
Best players play. No exceptions.

537
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:58,799
Right now, Kurek's the best player.

538
00:42:59,043 --> 00:43:01,841
A lot of guys take a while
to get started.

539
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:04,673
And Piccolo's never been
one of those guys.

540
00:43:05,616 --> 00:43:08,483
He's always been in shape.
Willing to give 100%.

541
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:12,021
He's not doing that anymore,
and that's what worries me.

542
00:43:13,824 --> 00:43:15,223
I don't know what it is.

543
00:43:15,459 --> 00:43:17,552
Could be something physical...

544
00:43:17,795 --> 00:43:20,855
...or it might be
an emotional disturbance.

545
00:43:21,565 --> 00:43:23,032
Something with his wife, children...?

546
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:24,325
Pic? Come on!

547
00:43:24,568 --> 00:43:26,229
Something's taken the edge off him.

548
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:28,700
And I gotta find out
what that something is.

549
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:30,736
For his sake, as well as the team's.

550
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:34,710
- When's he gonna find out?
- Abe's telling him now.

551
00:43:34,979 --> 00:43:38,005
That's why I didn't want you to
go back to the hotel right away.

552
00:43:40,484 --> 00:43:42,816
I wouldn't wanna be
in Abe's shoes right now.

553
00:43:44,688 --> 00:43:47,156
I wouldn't wanna be
in your shoes in 10 minutes.

554
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:07,068
Who'd believe it?
I mean, really, who'd believe it?

555
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:10,769
- Halas wants you to see the doctor.
- Halas don't know what he wants.

556
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:15,350
Gibron's his boy.
You should have heard that lecture.

557
00:44:15,586 --> 00:44:17,451
Wants me to patch things up with Joy.

558
00:44:17,688 --> 00:44:20,486
I say, "Things are fine
with me and Joy."

559
00:44:20,724 --> 00:44:24,922
He just smiles that
Father Flanagan smile of his...

560
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:27,494
...and says I shouldn't be
afraid to level with him.

561
00:44:29,533 --> 00:44:31,160
Dear Abby in a jockstrap.

562
00:44:31,402 --> 00:44:32,562
Pic, be fair.

563
00:44:32,803 --> 00:44:34,634
Dr. Fox says that...

564
00:44:34,905 --> 00:44:36,964
Don't give me no crud
about our great doctor.

565
00:44:37,207 --> 00:44:39,903
Wants me to get a physical
for the cough. No allergy.

566
00:44:40,144 --> 00:44:41,975
"What is it?" I say.
He says:

567
00:44:42,212 --> 00:44:44,544
"Well, it could be a virus.

568
00:44:45,115 --> 00:44:48,744
Could be a staph infection
or any one of a thousand things."

569
00:44:49,887 --> 00:44:52,913
Like being treated
in a damn Chinese restaurant.

570
00:44:55,292 --> 00:44:58,455
Two from Column A,
three from Column B.

571
00:45:01,999 --> 00:45:03,933
He's just trying to help.

572
00:45:15,612 --> 00:45:17,341
I guess you're right.

573
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:24,077
It's all so pointless, Gale.

574
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:29,523
I mean, I know perfectly well
what's wrong with me.

575
00:45:34,631 --> 00:45:36,155
I think I'm pregnant.

576
00:46:08,732 --> 00:46:12,429
Coach, which end of the field you
want me to take if we lose the toss?

577
00:46:15,739 --> 00:46:17,798
Come in, Gale. Close the door.

578
00:46:24,715 --> 00:46:26,808
We just got a call from the hospital.

579
00:46:27,918 --> 00:46:29,886
Brian Piccolo has cancer.

580
00:46:36,994 --> 00:46:37,824
Oh, God.

581
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:41,988
They've scheduled an operation
for tomorrow morning.

582
00:46:43,333 --> 00:46:44,493
An operation to do what?

583
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:53,073
They're gonna have to remove
part of Brian's right lung.

584
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:05,417
The doctors have no explanation.

585
00:47:07,024 --> 00:47:10,425
It's something that Brian carried
around inside him all his life.

586
00:47:11,962 --> 00:47:13,896
What kicked it off?
They don't know.

587
00:47:14,865 --> 00:47:18,028
Whether or not they got it in time...

588
00:47:19,403 --> 00:47:20,768
...l'm afraid they don't
know that either.

589
00:47:29,112 --> 00:47:30,841
Who's gonna tell them?

590
00:47:32,282 --> 00:47:33,112
I'll tell them.

591
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:35,081
No.

592
00:47:37,454 --> 00:47:38,853
I'll tell them.

593
00:47:39,823 --> 00:47:41,188
You, Gale?

594
00:47:41,625 --> 00:47:43,252
That's right, me.

595
00:47:44,428 --> 00:47:45,793
I'll tell them.

596
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:51,562
Let's go.

597
00:47:57,641 --> 00:48:00,269
May I have your attention
a minute, fellas?

598
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:01,772
Come on over here.

599
00:48:14,791 --> 00:48:16,918
Gale has something he wants
to say to you.

600
00:48:41,385 --> 00:48:43,250
You all know that...

601
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:47,053
...we hand out a game ball to...

602
00:48:52,462 --> 00:48:54,430
...the outstanding player.

603
00:48:56,033 --> 00:48:58,024
Well, I'd like to change that.

604
00:49:02,506 --> 00:49:04,269
We just got word...

605
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:08,836
...that Brian Piccolo is...

606
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:15,209
...sick, very sick.

607
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:22,784
And it looks like...

608
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:32,527
...he might never play football...

609
00:49:34,371 --> 00:49:35,702
...again.

610
00:49:41,211 --> 00:49:42,940
Or for a long time.

611
00:49:51,855 --> 00:49:54,619
I think we should
dedicate ourselves...

612
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:04,228
...to give our maximum effort
to win this game...

613
00:50:08,105 --> 00:50:10,198
...and give the game ball...

614
00:50:11,708 --> 00:50:13,005
...to Pic.

615
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:17,575
We can all sign it...

616
00:50:22,252 --> 00:50:24,083
...and take it up...

617
00:50:27,924 --> 00:50:29,255
...to the hos...

618
00:50:32,429 --> 00:50:34,124
Oh, my God.

619
00:50:39,336 --> 00:50:42,533
Fantastic! Could you believe it?

620
00:50:42,773 --> 00:50:46,971
Sayers, I mean, you've got some moves
on the field, but in a locker room...

621
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:49,508
...you are one big klutz.

622
00:50:49,746 --> 00:50:51,646
Now listen to me.

623
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:53,577
Listen now.

624
00:50:53,817 --> 00:50:55,444
When you dedicate
a game to someone...

625
00:50:55,685 --> 00:50:58,950
...you are then supposed to go
out and win it, idiot.

626
00:51:00,357 --> 00:51:03,224
Pat O'Brien never said,
"Let's blow one for the Gipper."

627
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:05,690
Man, you are so bad.

628
00:51:05,929 --> 00:51:08,762
We would have won if Concannon
called that trap play...

629
00:51:08,999 --> 00:51:12,435
...but he hates to call it without
you in there for the repeat.

630
00:51:21,311 --> 00:51:23,609
- Here, Gale.
- Thank you.

631
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:30,144
Beats ham hocks, don't it?

632
00:51:40,197 --> 00:51:42,188
Anybody wanna see my scar?

633
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:47,001
- Out!
- What's matter?

634
00:51:47,237 --> 00:51:50,035
Out, now! No discussion, out.

635
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:51,865
We just got here!

636
00:51:53,977 --> 00:51:56,275
See you later, guys.
Thanks for coming.

637
00:51:57,481 --> 00:52:00,177
- You just gonna lay there?
- J.C., hang on to this, will you?

638
00:52:00,417 --> 00:52:01,816
Later, Pic.

639
00:52:11,461 --> 00:52:16,330
Take Gale down and have him give
that little girl his autograph.

640
00:52:17,033 --> 00:52:19,228
A little girl I met
the day I came in...

641
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:21,300
...had her operation
the same day I did.

642
00:52:21,538 --> 00:52:24,166
Told her I'd give her your autograph.

643
00:52:24,407 --> 00:52:25,840
You don't mind, do you?

644
00:52:26,076 --> 00:52:28,101
No problem. I'll be glad to.

645
00:52:28,345 --> 00:52:30,643
All right. Take off.

646
00:52:38,522 --> 00:52:41,252
- It's time now, Mrs. Piccolo.
- Thank you.

647
00:52:48,565 --> 00:52:49,862
I'll be right back.

648
00:52:50,433 --> 00:52:51,695
Won't you?

649
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:14,887
May I help you?

650
00:53:19,863 --> 00:53:21,262
My name is Mrs. Piccolo.

651
00:53:21,498 --> 00:53:23,557
My husband's a patient
on the third floor...

652
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:26,462
...and he told me about
a little girl, Patti Lucas...

653
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:28,466
...who wanted this gentleman's
autograph.

654
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:31,132
Mrs. Piccolo, Patti isn't
with us anymore.

655
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:34,175
- Do you have a home address?
- Mrs. Piccolo, Patti...

656
00:53:34,411 --> 00:53:37,380
My husband wanted her to have
the autograph very much.

657
00:53:38,515 --> 00:53:39,709
Come on.

658
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:46,753
Mrs. Piccolo, Patti's dead.

659
00:53:48,425 --> 00:53:50,757
She passed away early this morning.

660
00:54:25,362 --> 00:54:27,296
Nothing wrong with
that knee, I tell you.

661
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:29,828
Congratulations, Dr. Piccolo.

662
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:36,136
Do you know what, Joy?

663
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:38,835
I've been thinking.

664
00:54:39,075 --> 00:54:42,511
What with Gale healthy,
and Ralph Kurek healthy...

665
00:54:42,746 --> 00:54:46,705
...l'm gonna have a tough time getting
back in that lineup next year.

666
00:54:48,018 --> 00:54:49,918
So I was thinking...

667
00:54:50,687 --> 00:54:53,588
...what's so difficult
about being a kicker?

668
00:54:55,325 --> 00:54:58,852
I just wonder if it's something
you can teach yourself.

669
00:54:59,095 --> 00:55:02,462
Because you don't need
a great amount of wind...

670
00:55:02,699 --> 00:55:04,724
...or stamina or size.

671
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:09,901
What do you think of my
brainstorm, old Gloomy Gus?

672
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:15,543
Well, I don't know, Brian.
I'm no expert on kickers and things.

673
00:55:15,812 --> 00:55:18,781
You just run an end run
Red Grange would be proud of.

674
00:55:21,184 --> 00:55:23,948
Don't make fun of me, Brian.
I'm scared.

675
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:26,049
What of?

676
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:30,956
You can't be serious.
You know perfectly well what of.

677
00:55:31,594 --> 00:55:35,360
No, I don't.
I swear to God, I don't, honey.

678
00:55:36,966 --> 00:55:38,558
Now, look, I'm...

679
00:55:38,802 --> 00:55:41,202
...no idiot.

680
00:55:41,438 --> 00:55:44,373
This thing I got is bad, I know that.

681
00:55:46,076 --> 00:55:48,772
It's just a detour, Joy.

682
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:50,946
I'm not gonna let it stop me.

683
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:53,809
I'm just not. There's no way.

684
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:57,247
I got too much to do yet, Joy.

685
00:56:11,968 --> 00:56:14,835
Pick it up.
Pick it up, you dummy!

686
00:56:15,939 --> 00:56:17,065
Mr. Piccolo, calm down.

687
00:56:17,307 --> 00:56:19,798
Calm down?
How do I calm down?

688
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:22,568
You'd think the ball was wearing
a white sheet.

689
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:28,073
I was gonna catch it, but when it
started coming down, I said to myself:

690
00:56:28,318 --> 00:56:31,754
"I wonder what Pic would do
in a situation like this."

691
00:56:31,988 --> 00:56:34,320
And dropping it seemed to be
the answer.

692
00:56:36,459 --> 00:56:39,860
- At least you won a game.
- That's right.

693
00:56:41,598 --> 00:56:43,429
You didn't dedicate this one to me?

694
00:56:43,666 --> 00:56:45,691
Nope. Dedicated it to Butkus.

695
00:56:45,935 --> 00:56:46,765
Why?

696
00:56:47,036 --> 00:56:48,731
Because he threatened us.

697
00:56:49,439 --> 00:56:50,667
How are you? Seriously.

698
00:56:55,345 --> 00:56:57,939
I'm hanging in there, Magic.

699
00:56:58,181 --> 00:57:00,706
Just doing what they tell me to do.

700
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:03,578
Listen...

701
00:57:04,387 --> 00:57:06,412
...will you do me a favor?

702
00:57:06,723 --> 00:57:08,554
You got it. Name it.

703
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:12,626
Call Joy, will you?

704
00:57:12,862 --> 00:57:15,228
When she left here tonight...

705
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:18,966
...she was really down.
I never saw her that down.

706
00:57:21,037 --> 00:57:22,800
I'll call her as soon
as I get back.

707
00:57:23,039 --> 00:57:24,631
Thanks, I appreciate it.

708
00:57:26,810 --> 00:57:28,368
Phone call for Mr. Sayers.

709
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:31,409
Lady says it's an emergency.
She seemed very upset.

710
00:57:31,648 --> 00:57:34,139
- I'll take it.
- I hope I did the right thing.

711
00:57:34,384 --> 00:57:36,750
I'm sure you did.
Thank you very much.

712
00:57:46,095 --> 00:57:47,027
From Joy Piccolo.

713
00:57:52,836 --> 00:57:57,432
I know it's awful to ask you to come
here in the middle of the night, but...

714
00:57:57,674 --> 00:58:00,438
It doesn't bother us,
so don't let it bother you.

715
00:58:07,984 --> 00:58:09,747
Why don't you just say it?

716
00:58:12,422 --> 00:58:14,754
They found more of the tumor.

717
00:58:24,667 --> 00:58:28,569
They told me this morning that
they want to operate again.

718
00:58:32,976 --> 00:58:35,342
I was going to tell Brian...

719
00:58:39,682 --> 00:58:41,707
...but I just couldn't, Gale.

720
00:58:45,488 --> 00:58:50,323
I mean, I don't know whether or not
he can take the disappointment.

721
00:58:52,996 --> 00:58:54,691
And if he can't...

722
00:58:55,865 --> 00:58:58,095
...I know I can't.

723
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:10,138
The doctor is going to tell him
in the morning.

724
00:59:13,583 --> 00:59:15,414
And if you could be there, Gale...

725
00:59:16,519 --> 00:59:18,214
...it might help.

726
00:59:22,792 --> 00:59:23,986
I'll be there, Joy.

727
00:59:30,433 --> 00:59:31,297
What'd you try?

728
00:59:31,634 --> 00:59:32,828
End run.

729
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:34,900
I had my linebackers in a blitz.

730
00:59:35,138 --> 00:59:36,298
All right.

731
00:59:38,875 --> 00:59:40,706
Well, did you gain or what?

732
00:59:41,744 --> 00:59:42,938
Come in.

733
00:59:44,681 --> 00:59:47,206
I'm sorry if I'm disturbing anything.

734
00:59:47,650 --> 00:59:49,174
Come on in. Not at all.

735
00:59:50,153 --> 00:59:52,417
I can beat him later.
What can I help you with?

736
00:59:52,655 --> 00:59:55,749
I know this is a bother at a time
like this, Mr. Piccolo...

737
00:59:55,992 --> 00:59:58,688
...but hospitals have rules
and regulations, you see.

738
00:59:58,928 --> 01:00:01,089
I need your signature on this.

739
01:00:01,331 --> 01:00:02,798
What is it?

740
01:00:07,637 --> 01:00:10,970
The doctor has been here, hasn't he?
He's talked to you?

741
01:00:11,207 --> 01:00:12,003
No. Why?

742
01:00:15,345 --> 01:00:17,313
- I'll step back a little later.
- No, wait.

743
01:00:21,184 --> 01:00:23,345
What would the doctor have
to say to me?

744
01:00:23,753 --> 01:00:24,913
Mr. P...

745
01:00:35,231 --> 01:00:36,823
Talk to me, Magic.

746
01:00:45,041 --> 01:00:46,804
The tests show...

747
01:00:51,614 --> 01:00:54,481
...there's more of the tumor
than they thought, Pic.

748
01:00:56,019 --> 01:00:58,146
They have to operate again.

749
01:01:30,019 --> 01:01:32,510
So if you'll just sign
this consent, Mr...

750
01:01:32,822 --> 01:01:33,789
Putting this off...

751
01:01:34,023 --> 01:01:35,957
I said, "No!" Are you deaf?

752
01:01:38,761 --> 01:01:41,195
Mr. Sayers, can't you talk
to your friend?

753
01:01:42,598 --> 01:01:43,565
Mr. Eberle...

754
01:01:44,567 --> 01:01:47,161
...I think I'd rather talk to you.

755
01:01:52,742 --> 01:01:55,074
Brian is a professional athlete,
Mr. Eberle.

756
01:01:55,311 --> 01:01:57,472
A professional gets into
a habit after a while.

757
01:01:58,081 --> 01:01:59,844
He gets himself ready for a game...

758
01:02:00,083 --> 01:02:02,881
...mentally as well as physically.

759
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:07,146
Because he knows those two things
are all tied up together.

760
01:02:08,257 --> 01:02:10,589
And there's a clock inside...

761
01:02:11,427 --> 01:02:13,827
...and when the game starts...

762
01:02:14,530 --> 01:02:17,021
...he's 100% mentally and physically.

763
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:19,964
And what Brian is saying...

764
01:02:20,203 --> 01:02:23,536
...is that you're scheduling the game
before he can get ready.

765
01:02:27,143 --> 01:02:29,668
Couldn't it wait until
over the weekend?

766
01:02:30,513 --> 01:02:31,309
Yes, it could...

767
01:02:31,547 --> 01:02:33,174
Then let it.

768
01:02:38,721 --> 01:02:40,916
First thing Monday morning,
Mr. Piccolo.

769
01:02:46,696 --> 01:02:48,220
I'll see you then.

770
01:03:32,909 --> 01:03:33,876
Thanks, Magic.

771
01:03:35,011 --> 01:03:36,478
No sweat.

772
01:03:54,030 --> 01:03:55,827
Looks like I scored a touchdown.

773
01:04:05,842 --> 01:04:09,505
Mr. Piccolo, we're gonna
put you to sleep now.

774
01:04:10,046 --> 01:04:12,514
That could be...

775
01:04:13,616 --> 01:04:16,881
...the worst choice of words
I've ever heard in my life.

776
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:20,883
The winner of this year's George S.
Halas Most Courageous Player award:

777
01:04:21,123 --> 01:04:22,852
Gale Sayers.

778
01:04:49,518 --> 01:04:53,682
I'd like to say a few words about
a guy I know, a friend of mine.

779
01:04:55,424 --> 01:04:57,358
His name is Brian Piccolo...

780
01:04:58,728 --> 01:05:00,923
...and he has the heart of a giant...

781
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:06,960
...and that rare form of courage
which allows him to kid himself...

782
01:05:07,203 --> 01:05:09,228
...and his opponent.

783
01:05:10,306 --> 01:05:11,773
Cancer.

784
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:15,937
He has the mental attitude...

785
01:05:16,178 --> 01:05:20,774
...which makes me proud to have
a friend who spells out courage...

786
01:05:21,017 --> 01:05:24,509
...24 hours a day,
every day of his life.

787
01:05:29,458 --> 01:05:31,255
Now you flatter me...

788
01:05:33,029 --> 01:05:35,259
...by giving me this award.

789
01:05:37,533 --> 01:05:39,865
But I say to you, here and now...

790
01:05:41,370 --> 01:05:44,396
...Brian Piccolo is the man of courage
who should receive...

791
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:46,870
...the George S. Halas award.

792
01:05:52,415 --> 01:05:54,542
It's mine tonight...

793
01:05:57,586 --> 01:05:59,850
...and Brian Piccolo's tomorrow.

794
01:06:09,465 --> 01:06:11,899
I love Brian Piccolo.

795
01:06:14,737 --> 01:06:17,331
And I'd like all of you
to love him too.

796
01:06:20,176 --> 01:06:23,942
And tonight, when you
hit your knees...

797
01:06:31,187 --> 01:06:34,281
...please ask God to love him.

798
01:07:00,116 --> 01:07:01,640
Hi, Magic.

799
01:07:02,485 --> 01:07:04,009
How you doing, Pic?

800
01:07:06,355 --> 01:07:08,220
I'm hanging in there.

801
01:07:08,457 --> 01:07:10,948
I heard what you did at...

802
01:07:11,193 --> 01:07:13,889
...that banquet last night.
If you were here I'd kiss you.

803
01:07:14,130 --> 01:07:16,257
I'm glad I'm not there, then.

804
01:07:17,133 --> 01:07:19,124
Hey, Gale, they...

805
01:07:19,368 --> 01:07:22,166
...tell me you gave me
a pint of blood. Is that true?

806
01:07:23,272 --> 01:07:24,261
Yep.

807
01:07:25,241 --> 01:07:26,902
That explains it then.

808
01:07:27,143 --> 01:07:29,043
Explains what?

809
01:07:29,845 --> 01:07:33,212
I've had this craving
for chitlins all day.

810
01:07:37,319 --> 01:07:39,082
I'll be there tomorrow.

811
01:07:40,189 --> 01:07:41,588
See you then.

812
01:07:41,991 --> 01:07:43,652
All right.

813
01:07:43,893 --> 01:07:45,690
I ain't going anywhere.

814
01:07:52,668 --> 01:07:54,033
How is he, Linda, really?

815
01:07:55,004 --> 01:07:57,199
Hurry, Gale. Please hurry.

816
01:08:25,968 --> 01:08:28,368
Brian, Gale's here.

817
01:08:42,451 --> 01:08:44,351
Hello, Black Magic.

818
01:08:51,026 --> 01:08:52,755
You're so bad.

819
01:08:55,898 --> 01:08:58,867
A racist, that's all you are.

820
01:09:01,270 --> 01:09:04,330
Just a bigot from head to toe.

821
01:09:06,775 --> 01:09:08,504
You better believe it, man.

822
01:09:14,216 --> 01:09:15,410
How you doing, Pic?

823
01:09:23,292 --> 01:09:24,782
It's fourth and eight...

824
01:09:29,598 --> 01:09:30,895
...and they won't let me punt.

825
01:09:35,037 --> 01:09:36,368
Go for it, then.

826
01:09:39,542 --> 01:09:41,772
I'm trying, Gale.

827
01:09:47,816 --> 01:09:50,216
Jesus, God, I'm trying.

828
01:10:22,952 --> 01:10:26,979
Remember you got me with
those mashed potatoes?

829
01:10:33,229 --> 01:10:34,856
You deserved it.

830
01:10:38,067 --> 01:10:41,525
The way you sang that dumb fight song.

831
01:10:45,507 --> 01:10:48,408
And that 32-trap play.

832
01:10:48,644 --> 01:10:50,168
Remember?

833
01:10:53,315 --> 01:10:54,976
I'm gonna...

834
01:10:58,120 --> 01:11:01,146
...get you next training camp.

835
01:11:01,390 --> 01:11:02,857
I'm gonna get you.

836
01:11:09,965 --> 01:11:11,592
I'll be waiting.

837
01:11:18,707 --> 01:11:20,572
I'm feeling a little...

838
01:11:21,944 --> 01:11:23,605
...punk.

839
01:11:25,014 --> 01:11:27,107
So I think I'll...

840
01:11:29,718 --> 01:11:32,016
...try to get some sack. Okay?

841
01:11:42,665 --> 01:11:44,223
I'll see you tomorrow.

842
01:11:45,401 --> 01:11:47,096
If you say so.

843
01:12:29,511 --> 01:12:31,502
I love you, Brian.

844
01:12:33,682 --> 01:12:35,172
I love you.

845
01:12:47,429 --> 01:12:49,761
Who'd believe it, Joy?

846
01:12:53,736 --> 01:12:54,964
Who'd ever believe it?

847
01:13:10,919 --> 01:13:14,355
Brian Piccolo died of cancer
at the age of 26.

848
01:13:14,590 --> 01:13:16,888
He left a wife and three daughters.

849
01:13:17,126 --> 01:13:19,617
He also left a great many
loving friends...

850
01:13:19,862 --> 01:13:22,023
...who miss him
and think of him often.

851
01:13:22,264 --> 01:13:26,132
But when they think of him, it's
not how he died that they remember...

852
01:13:26,368 --> 01:13:27,699
...but rather how he lived.

853
01:13:27,936 --> 01:13:30,131
How he did live.
