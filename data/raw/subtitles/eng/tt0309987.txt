1
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:22,286
The pawn of an obscure coalition...

2
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:23,919
of dubious interests...

3
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,157
the Minister Malraux
has driven...

4
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:30,032
Henri Langlois out
of the French Cinematheque.

5
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:33,105
...if offered us all
a free and fair conception...

6
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:35,265
of French film culture.

7
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:39,004
Now, for bureaucratic reasons,
culture's arch-enemies...

8
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,603
have seized this bastion
of liberty.

9
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:44,616
Resist them!

10
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:47,618
- Liberty isn't given!
- It's taken!

11
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,347
All those who love film...

12
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:50,945
- In France...
- And abroad.

13
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:52,149
...are with you.

14
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:55,523
And with Henry Langlois!

15
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,018
What lies behind it?

16
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:31,323
The police!

17
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,561
Excuse me.

18
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:13,569
Can you remove this?

19
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:16,532
It's stuck to my lips.

20
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:20,578
Can you remove my cigarette?
It's stuck.

21
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,807
Yes, yes...

22
00:06:22,915 --> 00:06:24,405
of course.

23
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:27,916
Sorry.

24
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:29,304
Truffaut, Godard, Charbol, Rivette...

25
00:07:29,415 --> 00:07:32,851
and Renoir,Jean Rouch,
Rohmerare here.

26
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:35,648
Signoret, Jean Marais
and God knows who else.

27
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:37,017
Marcel Carne too.

28
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,818
Why is Carne here?

29
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:42,156
What should we do?
Stay or leave?

30
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:44,627
I don't know.

31
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:17,396
- What's up with you?
- Me?

32
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,692
Come on, stick with me!

33
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:53,863
Fascists!

34
00:08:53,966 --> 00:08:56,935
- Bastards!
- Assholes!

35
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,563
The pavement of the Champs-Elysees.

36
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:50,577
Will you come to Rome with me?

37
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:50,723
Third floor!

38
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:56,757
Theo and I are contagious!
- What?

39
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:01,603
You mustn't catch us.

40
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,593
- It's beautiful.
- You think so?

41
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,162
Good luck.

42
00:14:32,838 --> 00:14:34,533
Evening, Maman.

43
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,475
What are you doing here?

44
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:40,738
- We're here for dinner.
- What?

45
00:14:40,846 --> 00:14:42,643
With Matthew.

46
00:14:42,748 --> 00:14:45,308
- Didn't Isabelle say?
- Which Matthew?

47
00:15:04,603 --> 00:15:06,161
What's wrong?

48
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:09,571
What can I say, Isabelle?
I'm cooking for two...

49
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:11,233
and now there are
five of us.

50
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:12,435
Didn't Theo
tell you?

51
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:15,274
No, he didn't.
And neither did you.

52
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:18,544
Have you got mashed potatoes
for brains or what?

53
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:20,448
You were supposed
to tell her!

54
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:22,179
You're crazy!

55
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:24,848
Bitch, cow, slut...

56
00:16:02,494 --> 00:16:04,462
Papa, it's me.

57
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:06,053
We're eating in.

58
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:08,531
And the cinematheque?

59
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,864
Closed until further
notice.

60
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:43,564
A petition is a poem,
a poem is a petition.

61
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:56,278
I hope I'll never be like him.

62
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:08,462
Yes, sorry. You were saying?

63
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:10,091
We should go to bed.

64
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:15,469
You had something
to tell the children, didn't you?

65
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,936
Yes, of course.

66
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:19,510
I'm sorry.

67
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,806
The cheques
are on the mantelpiece.

68
00:21:21,913 --> 00:21:24,507
Don't cash them
until you need them, all right?

69
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:32,657
Good night, Papa. Have a safe journey.

70
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:36,785
Good night, dear.
Theo.

71
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:54,376
Good night.

72
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:43,607
Come in.

73
00:30:45,977 --> 00:30:48,070
Good morning.

74
00:35:53,784 --> 00:35:55,718
Stop!

75
00:36:26,484 --> 00:36:28,008
He's good.

76
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:30,713
You know what I'm thinking?

77
00:36:30,821 --> 00:36:32,220
What?

78
00:36:32,323 --> 00:36:33,881
"Bande a part. "

79
00:36:33,991 --> 00:36:35,424
You're right.

80
00:37:38,889 --> 00:37:42,518
Go get Papa's stopwatch.

81
00:38:04,148 --> 00:38:06,207
Hey! No! Stop!

82
00:39:58,496 --> 00:39:59,588
That's Mama.

83
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:03,632
I'm too wet to answer.

84
00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:36,694
That's different.

85
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:41,226
Hello. Hello?

86
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:44,000
Too bad.
