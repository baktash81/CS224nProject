[Muttering]

12
00:02:30,818 --> 00:02:33,487
But do you mean to say,
Northbrook,

13
00:02:33,554 --> 00:02:35,656
that you know nothing
about Carpathia whatever?

14
00:02:35,723 --> 00:02:37,925
Don't even know where the beastly
place is, for a start.

15
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,993
How long have you been
in the foreign office?

16
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,162
15 years, sir, but I'm in
the far eastern department.

17
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:43,997
Now, that's no excuse.

18
00:02:44,064 --> 00:02:47,368
What would you think if I said
that I knew nothing about Siam?

19
00:02:47,435 --> 00:02:49,203
Don't think I'd mind very much.

20
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:52,039
That sort of remark will
get you nowhere, Northbrook.

21
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:53,741
Not even out of this job?

22
00:02:53,807 --> 00:02:54,807
Certainly not.

23
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:57,110
Your predecessor
has had a riding accident,

24
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,779
and you are now in his saddle,

25
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:01,882
attached to suite of the grand Duke Charles,
regent of Carpathia,

26
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:03,617
and there's an end of it.

27
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:05,886
But I made so many jolly little
plans for the coronation,

28
00:03:05,953 --> 00:03:07,855
and I don't speak
a word of Carpathian.

29
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:09,457
Oh, that's all right.

30
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:13,026
Fortunately, they're excessively
proud of their English.

31
00:03:13,093 --> 00:03:15,963
Now, look here, Northbrook.

32
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:18,799
Carpathia...

33
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:21,969
a mixed german/slav population
of 11 1/2 millions,

34
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:24,638
the most efficient railway
service in the Balkans,

35
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:27,541
and the fourth-largest
army in Europe.

36
00:03:27,608 --> 00:03:31,144
So delicately poised is the
balance of power at this moment

37
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,981
that the secession
of this from...

38
00:03:35,182 --> 00:03:36,182
This...

39
00:03:36,183 --> 00:03:38,452
To...

40
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:41,389
That would certainly
make the aggressor

41
00:03:41,455 --> 00:03:43,591
feel strong enough
to start his war.

42
00:03:43,657 --> 00:03:46,360
And I presume that even in
the far eastern department

43
00:03:46,427 --> 00:03:49,997
they have some idea of who that
aggressor would likely to be.

44
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,399
Kaiser Wilhelm.

45
00:03:51,465 --> 00:03:53,867
Precisely.
Kaiser bill.

46
00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:56,770
They should've left
the station by now.

47
00:03:56,837 --> 00:04:00,240
You'd better get along
to their embassy.

48
00:04:00,308 --> 00:04:03,311
Yes, by Jove, here they are.

49
00:04:04,612 --> 00:04:07,381
There, Northbrook.
There is your future charge.

50
00:04:07,448 --> 00:04:09,116
Who's the boy?

51
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:11,985
The king, for heaven's sake.
The regent's son.

52
00:04:12,052 --> 00:04:13,387
Don't you know anything?

53
00:04:13,454 --> 00:04:15,423
Unhappily,
the boy's pro-German,

54
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:17,100
a cousin of the kaiser
on his mother's side,

55
00:04:17,124 --> 00:04:19,827
and in 18 months' time,
when he comes to power,

56
00:04:19,893 --> 00:04:21,795
we shall have to
look out for trouble.

57
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:23,964
That's the queen dowager
beside him...

58
00:04:24,031 --> 00:04:27,635
the boy's grandmother,
the regent's mother-in-law.

59
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:30,103
Quite a formidable old lady.

60
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:32,406
And there is the regent.

61
00:04:32,473 --> 00:04:35,275
A character, Northbrook.

62
00:04:35,343 --> 00:04:37,378
Definitely a character.

63
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:45,152
By the way, grand ducal highness,
not serene.

64
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:47,421
And all for formalities...

65
00:04:47,488 --> 00:04:50,324
backing out,
all that sort of thing.

66
00:04:50,391 --> 00:04:52,092
He's very touchy
about those matters.

67
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:54,928
In fact, he's a very touchy
proposition altogether,

68
00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:56,864
but a very vital one.

69
00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:01,168
He must not by one jot nor
one tittle be offended.

70
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:04,271
And you are the instrument
chosen by fate and by me

71
00:05:04,338 --> 00:05:05,939
to see to that happy result.

72
00:05:06,006 --> 00:05:08,809
Tonight, for instance,
take him out, entertain him...

73
00:05:08,876 --> 00:05:10,076
the opera, whatever he wishes.

74
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,712
The opera? I say.

75
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:15,048
I said, Northbrook,
whatever he wishes.

76
00:05:31,365 --> 00:05:32,866
Yes, who is it?

77
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:34,143
Miss Marina, hurry.
You'll be late.

78
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,335
What?

79
00:05:35,403 --> 00:05:36,913
All the principals
to meet the royal party.

80
00:05:36,937 --> 00:05:39,172
Miss Springfield's lining
them up on the stage now.

81
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:41,141
Oh, gosh!
My shoulder thing is busted.

82
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:42,476
Just keep still.

83
00:05:42,543 --> 00:05:43,711
What party?

84
00:05:43,777 --> 00:05:45,212
It'll be that Carpathian lot

85
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:47,114
in the royal box, I expect.

86
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,817
Oh, gosh!

87
00:05:49,883 --> 00:05:53,521
You'll be all right,
dear, only hurry.

88
00:05:58,926 --> 00:06:01,662
Quickly. Quickly, everyone, into line.
He's coming.

89
00:06:03,531 --> 00:06:06,333
Quickly! Quiet, everyone. Into line.
He's coming. Who's missing?

90
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,201
Elsie Marina.

91
00:06:08,268 --> 00:06:10,447
She would be. Can't that girl
ever make an entrance on time?

92
00:06:10,471 --> 00:06:12,406
They said to tell her,
miss Springfield.

93
00:06:12,473 --> 00:06:14,984
Chorus, in 2 groups, and remember,
you are to be seen and not heard.

94
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:17,745
And, principals,
you are not to speak

95
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:19,246
unless you are
directly addressed.

96
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:20,981
Should that happy
privilege be yours,

97
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:23,884
the regent is to be
addressed as your grand...

98
00:06:23,951 --> 00:06:25,719
Ducal highness.

99
00:06:33,193 --> 00:06:35,262
May I present
miss Maisie Springfield?

100
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:37,765
But I know miss Springfield well.
We are old friends.

101
00:06:37,831 --> 00:06:39,299
Oh, your grand ducal highness.

102
00:06:39,366 --> 00:06:42,402
What a charming character
is this, uh, coconut girl.

103
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:45,105
Oh, I'm so happy to hear your
grand ducal highness say so.

104
00:06:45,172 --> 00:06:49,677
It is a character that goes a little
deeper than most in musical comedy.

105
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:51,378
Ah, yes. Yes, indeed.
Quite so.

106
00:06:51,445 --> 00:06:52,722
I have been so anxious
to find a role

107
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:55,583
which offered an...
an emotional challenge.

108
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:57,150
Most charming it is.

109
00:06:57,217 --> 00:06:59,186
I began to feel we had
lost the gay person

110
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,021
that I knew in Paris.

111
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:03,290
How gracious of you,
sir, to remember.

112
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:06,827
I look forward to...
and this, I take it, is our hero.

113
00:07:06,894 --> 00:07:10,163
I'm most honored to meet your...
Grand ducal highness.

114
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:13,934
I trust lord Percy will
manage to extricate himself

115
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:15,569
from his present impasse.

116
00:07:15,636 --> 00:07:18,639
Oh, yes. Yes, indeed, sir,
as you'll see, I hope.

117
00:07:18,706 --> 00:07:20,207
How do you do?
Good evening.

118
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,542
Mr. Tim Thorne Lestrange.

119
00:07:21,609 --> 00:07:23,210
Gosh, what do I do?

120
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,445
Just take his hand and curtsy.

121
00:07:25,513 --> 00:07:26,479
What is he, a king or something?

122
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,314
Regent.

123
00:07:27,315 --> 00:07:29,083
What's that?

124
00:07:29,149 --> 00:07:32,219
It's a sort of king's understudy,
but he's on all the time.

125
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,354
Regent.

126
00:07:34,421 --> 00:07:35,623
Regent: How do you do?

127
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:36,423
Man: Good evening, sir.

128
00:07:36,424 --> 00:07:37,658
Miss Betty boot.

129
00:07:37,725 --> 00:07:40,027
Most charming.
Delightful.

130
00:07:40,093 --> 00:07:42,329
Such pretty music.
Did you think so?

131
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:43,396
Oh, I did. Yes, sir.

132
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,365
Yes. It, um...

133
00:07:45,432 --> 00:07:48,969
Good play.
It goes a little deeper, I think.

134
00:07:49,036 --> 00:07:50,704
Oh, yes, sir.
Rather, sir.

135
00:07:50,771 --> 00:07:52,239
Charming disguises.

136
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,041
Mr. Dan Lupino.

137
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:55,342
Most amusing.

138
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:56,977
Miss Maggie Cooper.

139
00:07:57,044 --> 00:08:00,681
Most agreeable.
Such a strong and original story,

140
00:08:00,748 --> 00:08:01,849
don't you think so?

141
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:03,917
Oh, yes, sir.
We all love it.

142
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:07,555
It offers an emotional
challenge, no?

143
00:08:07,621 --> 00:08:09,557
Oh, yes, sir, like anything.

144
00:08:09,623 --> 00:08:10,791
Miss Murgatroid.

145
00:08:10,858 --> 00:08:13,961
[Speaking native language]

146
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:15,262
What do I say?

147
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,630
Just how do you do?

148
00:08:16,697 --> 00:08:17,977
What if he says something to me?

149
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:20,133
You say something back.
Come on, get into line.

150
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,200
Mr. Arthur Lucas.

151
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:22,770
Good evening.
Miss Fanny Trehearne.

152
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,605
Ah, how do you do?
Most delightful.

153
00:08:24,672 --> 00:08:26,239
Miss Elsie Marina.

154
00:08:26,306 --> 00:08:29,543
And the little American
friend of our heroine, huh?

155
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:30,744
How do you do?
Good evening.

156
00:08:30,811 --> 00:08:33,513
How do you do,
your regent... oops.

157
00:08:33,581 --> 00:08:35,849
The damage, I trust,
can be retrieved?

158
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:37,818
Oh, yes. I can
fix it with a pin.

159
00:08:37,885 --> 00:08:39,219
A pin.
Has no one here a pin?

160
00:08:39,286 --> 00:08:40,954
I should be most happy
to assist you.

161
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:42,890
Oh, no, your regency.

162
00:08:42,956 --> 00:08:45,693
Ha ha. Charming.
Most delightful.

163
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:47,060
Well, good night.

164
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:50,030
Oh, perhaps better not
tempt Providence again.

165
00:08:50,097 --> 00:08:51,098
Ha ha ha ha.

166
00:08:51,164 --> 00:08:55,302
Well, good night,
ladies and, uh...

167
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:56,970
Good night.

168
00:08:59,807 --> 00:09:01,775
I'm really...
I'm very pleased,

169
00:09:01,842 --> 00:09:03,611
really very pleased.

170
00:09:03,677 --> 00:09:07,214
Oh. So many doors,
like an audience with the Japanese emperor.

171
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,582
Yes, indeed.

172
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:10,183
I'm so sorry I must
leave your theater,

173
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,219
but, alas,
the foreign secretary awaits me.

174
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:14,387
Oh, yes, sir.
What a shame you couldn't stay

175
00:09:14,454 --> 00:09:15,889
and see our
lovely wedding scene.

176
00:09:15,956 --> 00:09:18,726
Dare we hope for another visit
from your serene highness?

177
00:09:23,597 --> 00:09:25,198
Himmel, he's not serene.

178
00:09:25,265 --> 00:09:28,168
He has not been serene
since he was regent.

179
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:32,372
All right, he's gone.
Come on, get on with it.

180
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:35,709
[All talking excitedly]

181
00:09:35,776 --> 00:09:38,946
Oh, miss Springfield,
I'm terribly sorry for being so late.

182
00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:40,914
That, miss Marina,
I'm prepared to forget,

183
00:09:40,981 --> 00:09:42,826
but what I cannot forgive
is your disgracing us all

184
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:44,652
in front of my very
dear friend the regent.

185
00:09:44,718 --> 00:09:46,654
See?
It could've happened to anyone.

186
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,955
It could happen to anyone.

187
00:09:48,021 --> 00:09:49,322
That's what makes it so funny,

188
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:51,458
that it always seems
to happen to you.

189
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:53,761
What did you think of him,
by the way?

190
00:09:53,827 --> 00:09:57,130
Don't you think
he's rather a dream?

191
00:09:57,197 --> 00:09:58,465
A dream, she says.

192
00:09:58,531 --> 00:09:59,800
She knows better.

193
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,907
If those are your wishes, sir,

194
00:10:06,974 --> 00:10:08,742
they will be
carried out, of course.

195
00:10:08,809 --> 00:10:11,211
If you please, Mr. Northbrook.

196
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:17,918
Come in.

197
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:19,153
Miss Marina, a letter.

198
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:20,220
What?

199
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:24,157
I say, by Jove, you look
absolutely stunning.

200
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:25,993
Oh, go away, silly.

201
00:10:26,927 --> 00:10:29,096
Good evening, milord.

202
00:10:31,198 --> 00:10:32,198
Miss Marina.

203
00:10:32,232 --> 00:10:34,201
Miss Marina.

204
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,135
Else.

205
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:41,641
Have I got too much Rouge on?

206
00:10:41,709 --> 00:10:42,976
Where are you going?
Romano's.

207
00:10:43,043 --> 00:10:45,012
No, that's all right.
Pink shades.

208
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:46,446
Aha.
Private room?

209
00:10:46,513 --> 00:10:47,881
Certainly not.
The idea.

210
00:10:47,948 --> 00:10:49,649
Come on, Betty.
Who are they?

211
00:10:49,717 --> 00:10:51,251
Oh, we don't know
their names, dear.

212
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:53,186
Betty. Oh,
don't be late, loves.

213
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:55,131
But they're all right.
They're in the lifeguards.

214
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:56,656
Oh, come on.

215
00:10:56,724 --> 00:10:58,501
Remember, we've got to be in our
places tomorrow morning at 7:00.

216
00:10:58,525 --> 00:11:00,193
7:00?
Yes, 7:00.

217
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,495
But the procession doesn't
start till half past 9:00.

218
00:11:02,562 --> 00:11:04,497
That's what it says in the papers, dear.
[Blows]

219
00:11:04,564 --> 00:11:05,598
Whatever is that?

220
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,634
Prop man gave to me
for tomorrow.

221
00:11:07,701 --> 00:11:10,738
It's all right. I'll see she gets
there on time. Come on, Betty.

222
00:11:10,804 --> 00:11:12,272
Oh, I wouldn't miss
the coronation

223
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:14,274
for the whole brigade of guards.

224
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:17,610
I say, by Jove, you look
absolutely stunning.

225
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:21,148
Good night, Ivy, dear.
Don't wait for us.

226
00:11:21,214 --> 00:11:22,750
Oh, thanks, dear.
Good night.

227
00:11:22,816 --> 00:11:23,951
So long, else.

228
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:25,886
What's that,
summons or something?

229
00:11:25,953 --> 00:11:27,654
Hey, listen.
Come here.

230
00:11:27,721 --> 00:11:29,322
Listen.

231
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:31,959
"His grand ducal highness,

232
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:34,995
"the grand Duke Charles,
prince regent of Carpathia,

233
00:11:35,062 --> 00:11:39,032
"requests the pleasure of
miss Elsie Marina's company

234
00:11:39,099 --> 00:11:41,935
"at supper this evening,
June the 21st, 1911,

235
00:11:42,002 --> 00:11:45,338
"at 12 midnight
at Carpathian embassy,

236
00:11:45,405 --> 00:11:47,741
46 Belgrave square."

237
00:11:47,808 --> 00:11:48,909
Let me see.
Is it a joke?

238
00:11:48,976 --> 00:11:50,677
"The honorable Peter Northbrook

239
00:11:50,744 --> 00:11:52,946
"will present himself at
the Avenue theater at 11:15

240
00:11:53,013 --> 00:11:56,917
to escort miss Marina
to the embassy."

241
00:11:56,984 --> 00:11:58,752
You're in, dear.

242
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:03,757
Oh, gosh, I don't
have a thing to wear.

243
00:12:11,832 --> 00:12:13,566
Please, ladies, please.

244
00:12:13,633 --> 00:12:14,701
Time is getting short.

245
00:12:14,768 --> 00:12:16,403
Oh, this won't do.

246
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:18,349
I think this one's the best,
Elsie, dear, honest.

247
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:21,674
Say, who else is coming to this
party besides his majesty?

248
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,076
His majesty?

249
00:12:23,143 --> 00:12:25,112
Yes, that... that...
that grand Duke.

250
00:12:25,178 --> 00:12:27,714
Oh, my dear, you've
quite startled me.

251
00:12:27,781 --> 00:12:29,049
Look, miss Marina,

252
00:12:29,116 --> 00:12:31,151
I think perhaps before
you meet the regent again,

253
00:12:31,218 --> 00:12:32,796
you should learn the
correct form of address.

254
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,421
Otherwise, who knows?

255
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:37,624
There may be a few petites
moments d'embarras.

256
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,392
Oh, I just hate that.

257
00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:43,030
Your host tonight is correctly
addressed as your grand ducal highness

258
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:45,498
or sir. Although,
as the prince of Hungary,

259
00:12:45,565 --> 00:12:48,268
which he was before he married
the late queen of Carpathia,

260
00:12:48,335 --> 00:12:50,403
he is, I suppose,
correctly entitled

261
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,873
to the formal appellation
of imperial and royal.

262
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,242
Although, at that time,
by his own request,

263
00:12:55,308 --> 00:12:58,545
serene highness was continued
until he became regent.

264
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:01,181
I don't know what
you're talking about.

265
00:13:01,248 --> 00:13:03,917
It's most important that you should,
miss Marina.

266
00:13:03,984 --> 00:13:06,686
And I don't even know who you are,
much less who he is.

267
00:13:06,753 --> 00:13:09,823
I am his grand ducal highness'
personal equerry.

268
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:11,758
And in my own right,

269
00:13:11,825 --> 00:13:14,403
the deputy head of the far eastern
department of the foreign office.

270
00:13:14,427 --> 00:13:17,464
Deputy head of the far eastern department.
Imagine.

271
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,099
Imagine.

272
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:22,435
I still don't know anything.
I mean, why, uh...

273
00:13:22,502 --> 00:13:24,838
Royal and imperial?
Isn't one enough?

274
00:13:24,905 --> 00:13:27,140
Well, it all goes back
to the holy Roman empire.

275
00:13:27,207 --> 00:13:28,842
The grand Duke
is a nephew by marriage...

276
00:13:28,909 --> 00:13:30,010
Bulging on the hip?

277
00:13:30,077 --> 00:13:32,045
Of the emperor
Franz Josef of Austria.

278
00:13:32,112 --> 00:13:34,681
All right. No wisecracks
about Austria, then.

279
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:37,985
I sincerely hope no wisecracks
about anything, miss Trehearne.

280
00:13:38,051 --> 00:13:40,053
In these troubled times,
the lightest remark

281
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,122
can have most terrible
repercussions.

282
00:13:42,189 --> 00:13:44,157
I can see
the history books now...

283
00:13:44,224 --> 00:13:45,658
the war of Elsie's remark.

284
00:13:45,725 --> 00:13:47,436
Say, is it all right
over the you-know-what?

285
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,029
Wonderful over
the you-know-what.

286
00:13:49,096 --> 00:13:52,099
You can come out now.

287
00:13:54,734 --> 00:13:55,734
Well?

288
00:13:55,735 --> 00:13:56,904
Very nice.

289
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:58,671
Is that all you can say?

290
00:13:58,738 --> 00:14:00,273
Very nice, indeed.

291
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,208
Oh, miss Marina,

292
00:14:01,209 --> 00:14:02,809
there is one other small point...

293
00:14:02,876 --> 00:14:04,244
in conversation with royalty,

294
00:14:04,311 --> 00:14:07,380
only speak when you are
directly addressed.

295
00:14:07,447 --> 00:14:08,781
What did he say?

296
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,951
Wait for the cue before speaking the line,
dear.

297
00:14:11,018 --> 00:14:12,219
Good night, Mr. Northbrook.

298
00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:14,387
Good night.
I won't wait up.

299
00:14:14,454 --> 00:14:17,757
Are you sure he hasn't gotten me
mixed up with Maisie Springfield?

300
00:14:17,824 --> 00:14:19,592
He's a very dear friend of hers,

301
00:14:19,659 --> 00:14:20,659
she keeps telling us.

302
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,329
I'm quite sure of that.

303
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:25,332
But why me? I just have that
little bit in the second act.

304
00:14:25,398 --> 00:14:27,334
Perhaps that was just
the little bit he liked.

305
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,336
But why me?
I wonder why he wants me.

306
00:14:29,402 --> 00:14:32,005
Hmm. Tough question that,
all right.

307
00:14:32,072 --> 00:14:33,706
Don't forget
tomorrow morning, dear.

308
00:14:33,773 --> 00:14:36,109
Must leave here sharp at 6:20,

309
00:14:36,176 --> 00:14:38,611
so don't be too late.
Good night.

310
00:14:38,678 --> 00:14:40,147
Be good!

311
00:14:49,256 --> 00:14:53,826
Gosh, this is the first time
I've ever seen an embassy.

312
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,462
Surely not.

313
00:14:55,528 --> 00:14:58,365
After all, there are 9 embassies
in London at the present time.

314
00:15:00,167 --> 00:15:03,336
Anyway, it's the first time
I've ever been...

315
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:05,305
Inside of one.

316
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,341
Gosh.

317
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:11,378
This is really something,
isn't it?

318
00:15:11,444 --> 00:15:12,912
Something.

319
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:15,182
This hallway and everything.

320
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:16,416
Yes.

321
00:15:16,483 --> 00:15:20,520
Personally,
I find the decorations a little vulgar.

322
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:23,890
Well, all I can can say
is give me vulgarity.

323
00:15:23,957 --> 00:15:25,925
We needn't have hurried so much.

324
00:15:25,993 --> 00:15:27,594
We're the first ones, aren't we?

325
00:15:28,695 --> 00:15:30,563
This way, miss Marina.

326
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:33,433
Upstairs? What's the idea of
having a supper party upstairs?

327
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,268
Well, it's quite
an informal party.

328
00:15:35,335 --> 00:15:38,238
But think of all the trouble
of bringing the food

329
00:15:38,305 --> 00:15:39,639
all the way up from the kitchen.

330
00:15:39,706 --> 00:15:42,409
I fancy it'll be a cold supper,
miss Marina.

331
00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:44,311
Well, they still
have to carry it up.

332
00:15:44,377 --> 00:15:46,379
Is his wife going to be here?

333
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:49,616
No, miss Marina.
Her late majesty passed over, as they say,

334
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:50,682
some 10 years ago.

335
00:15:50,717 --> 00:15:51,918
Oh.

336
00:15:51,985 --> 00:15:53,196
Now, if you should meet
the queen dowager...

337
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,587
oh, gosh, another one?

338
00:15:54,654 --> 00:15:56,789
She is addressed as
"your majesty" or "ma'am."

339
00:15:56,856 --> 00:15:58,525
Now, the young king,
the regent's son...

340
00:15:58,591 --> 00:15:59,826
oh, no.

341
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:01,971
Well, it's extremely unlikely
that you will meet him,

342
00:16:01,995 --> 00:16:04,331
but he is
"your majesty" or "sir."

343
00:16:04,397 --> 00:16:08,335
I'm shaking.
This is worse than a first night.

344
00:16:10,237 --> 00:16:13,106
Oh, we're still the first ones,
aren't we?

345
00:16:13,173 --> 00:16:16,109
Gee, this is all right,
too, isn't it?

346
00:16:16,176 --> 00:16:18,645
Is that the dining room
in there?

347
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:20,013
No.

348
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:24,717
Well, is it in there?

349
00:16:24,784 --> 00:16:26,153
No.

350
00:16:27,954 --> 00:16:29,589
There, then.

351
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:30,656
No.

352
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:32,292
Well, where is it?

353
00:16:32,359 --> 00:16:34,194
Hmm.

354
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:39,766
And incidentally,
where is his regency?

355
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,268
His grand ducal highness.

356
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:43,470
Oh, well, all right.
But where is he?

357
00:16:43,536 --> 00:16:46,206
He was called away
to an important meeting.

358
00:16:59,586 --> 00:17:00,720
Hey!

359
00:17:20,473 --> 00:17:21,941
Two places.

360
00:17:22,008 --> 00:17:23,042
Pas devant.

361
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:24,844
What?
Not in front of them.

362
00:17:24,911 --> 00:17:26,079
I know, but two places. Shh!

363
00:17:34,121 --> 00:17:35,388
[Doors close]

364
00:17:35,455 --> 00:17:36,999
Please, miss Marina,
I beg you, control yourself.

365
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:38,591
There's no need for panic.

366
00:17:38,658 --> 00:17:40,527
Oh, isn't there?
This is a plot, isn't it?

367
00:17:40,593 --> 00:17:42,495
Supper for two.
You knew all the time.

368
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,664
Well, I suppose I have to
confess I did have an idea

369
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:46,709
when I received the grand Duke's
instructions regarding yourself...

370
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:48,668
you know, there's a word
for what you are,

371
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:52,305
and it's not deputy head of
the far eastern department.

372
00:17:52,372 --> 00:17:54,574
Miss Marina, I implore you
not to leap to conclusions.

373
00:17:54,641 --> 00:17:56,419
I don't have to do any
leaping to this conclusion.

374
00:17:56,443 --> 00:17:58,287
I just walked straight there,
and I'm walking straight out!

375
00:17:58,311 --> 00:18:00,913
But why this panic over a harmless
little tete-à-tete supper?

376
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:04,251
Oh, I know all about these harmless
little tete-à-tete suppers.

377
00:18:04,317 --> 00:18:06,286
I've had to fight my way
out of quite a few.

378
00:18:06,353 --> 00:18:08,288
"Champagne, and I hope
you like caviar

379
00:18:08,355 --> 00:18:09,922
"and something cold to follow,

380
00:18:09,989 --> 00:18:12,292
"because we really don't want
the servants around, do we?

381
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:15,395
"It's so much more fun serving ourselves,
don't you think?

382
00:18:15,462 --> 00:18:18,198
"And then after supper, miss Marina,
you must be very tired.

383
00:18:18,265 --> 00:18:21,067
Why don't you put your feet
up on this nice sofa?"

384
00:18:21,134 --> 00:18:22,735
Oh, no.
I know every move.

385
00:18:22,802 --> 00:18:24,082
Aren't you
confusing this embassy

386
00:18:24,137 --> 00:18:25,672
with a private room at Romano's?

387
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:27,474
What's the difference?
Except up there,

388
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,276
it's a longer run from
the sofa to the door.

389
00:18:29,342 --> 00:18:31,778
And there's no evidence
that a Duke can't run

390
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:33,004
just as fast as the next man.

391
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:34,013
Oh, please, please, miss Marina.

392
00:18:34,014 --> 00:18:35,282
Pas devant.

393
00:18:35,348 --> 00:18:36,916
Now, don't give me
pas devant stuff.

394
00:18:36,983 --> 00:18:38,451
Make any excuse you like, uh...

395
00:18:38,518 --> 00:18:40,553
My aunt's ill or something.
Your aunt, miss Marina?

396
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,589
I'm awfully sorry.
Really I am, but good-bye.

397
00:18:42,655 --> 00:18:44,357
Oh, please, please,
please, miss Marina.

398
00:18:44,424 --> 00:18:46,135
You want to get me and
the whole foreign office

399
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:46,926
in the most terrible trouble?

400
00:18:46,993 --> 00:18:48,661
Since you asked, yes.

401
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:50,506
I'm sure you don't want
to insult the grand Duke.

402
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:51,674
Why don't you have a
little supper with him?

403
00:18:51,698 --> 00:18:53,266
It'll be a very good one.

404
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:54,610
He's the most charming
conversationalist.

405
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:56,769
After supper,
all you have to say is,

406
00:18:56,836 --> 00:18:59,572
"well, sir, it's been a most delightful
evening, and I must go home."

407
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:02,509
Yes, as an exit line, that's swell,
but can you guarantee the exit?

408
00:19:02,575 --> 00:19:04,953
I don't think so. This is a Balkan
grand Duke, for heaven's sake.

409
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,346
Educated in England.

410
00:19:06,413 --> 00:19:08,848
That's just what I mean.
No. Listen, please.

411
00:19:08,915 --> 00:19:10,383
Miss Marina, please.

412
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:14,053
Look, supposing I do guarantee your exit,
as you call it?

413
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,489
Supposing I give you time for supper,
and then after supper,

414
00:19:16,556 --> 00:19:18,658
I come in with a message
from a hospital,

415
00:19:18,725 --> 00:19:21,160
where your aunt has been
taken after an accident?

416
00:19:21,228 --> 00:19:23,162
Well, I don't know.

417
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:26,333
No, I don't think so at all.

418
00:19:26,399 --> 00:19:28,835
Why, thank you.

419
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:32,505
How do you do?
So good of you to come on such short notice.

420
00:19:32,572 --> 00:19:34,241
Oh, that's all right,
your regency.

421
00:19:34,307 --> 00:19:35,642
Your grand ducal.

422
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:38,077
Oh, that's all right,
your grand ducal.

423
00:19:38,144 --> 00:19:40,847
Highness.
Grand ducal highness.

424
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:42,048
Oh, the hell with it.

425
00:19:42,114 --> 00:19:44,050
I must apologize for being late.

426
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:46,319
The crowds are already
gathering in the streets,

427
00:19:46,386 --> 00:19:47,387
and my motor was held up.

428
00:19:47,454 --> 00:19:49,356
That's all right.

429
00:19:49,422 --> 00:19:51,734
Northbrook, I expect you are looking
forward to your night's rest.

430
00:19:51,758 --> 00:19:53,078
We have a very full day
before us.

431
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:54,727
We have indeed, sir.

432
00:19:54,794 --> 00:19:56,863
The carriage leaves the
embassy for Buckingham Palace

433
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:59,031
at 9:00. If you're
here at 8:20...

434
00:19:59,098 --> 00:20:00,199
Very good, sir.
Good night.

435
00:20:00,267 --> 00:20:02,502
Good night,
your grand ducal highness.

436
00:20:20,287 --> 00:20:23,022
Were you surprised
to get my invitation?

437
00:20:23,089 --> 00:20:25,057
I'll say I was.
I was so surprised,

438
00:20:25,124 --> 00:20:26,402
I couldn't hardly think
you meant me.

439
00:20:26,426 --> 00:20:28,094
Oh, but of course I meant you.

440
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,997
I had your name most carefully
marked down on my program.

441
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,900
In matters of this kind,
I assure you, I am most methodical.

442
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:36,836
Who did you think I meant
if not you, huh?

443
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:38,771
Well, Maisie Springfield.

444
00:20:38,838 --> 00:20:41,441
Oh, no, no, no.
Maisie Springfield...

445
00:20:41,508 --> 00:20:43,576
she's far too,
what I would call, old hat.

446
00:20:43,643 --> 00:20:45,545
Oh?
And am I what you'd call new hat?

447
00:20:45,612 --> 00:20:49,181
Ha ha ha!
Excellent, miss, uh... Miss, uh...

448
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,150
You don't have
your program handy.

449
00:20:51,217 --> 00:20:53,019
Shh!
Ha ha ha ha ha.

450
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,387
Capital. Most amusing.

451
00:20:54,454 --> 00:20:55,598
Marina. Elsie Marina.
That's my name.

452
00:20:55,622 --> 00:20:56,823
Of course.
How stupid of me.

453
00:20:56,889 --> 00:20:59,292
It's just my stage name,
Elsie Marina.

454
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:01,027
My dad was a marine, see?

455
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:03,430
My real name
is Elsie Stolzenburg.

456
00:21:04,063 --> 00:21:05,532
Indeed.

457
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:09,101
I decided to change it when I
decided to stay in England.

458
00:21:09,168 --> 00:21:12,539
You see,
the company I came over with from the states,

459
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:14,507
um, they got stranded
in New York.

460
00:21:14,574 --> 00:21:16,275
In the strand?
Really?

461
00:21:16,343 --> 00:21:19,812
♪ let's all go down the strand,
have a banana ♪

462
00:21:19,879 --> 00:21:22,382
heh heh heh heh.
Most amusing.

463
00:21:22,449 --> 00:21:23,616
You like caviar, I hope.

464
00:21:23,683 --> 00:21:25,217
Oh, yes.

465
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:28,688
I ordered a cold supper because
then we can serve ourselves,

466
00:21:28,755 --> 00:21:30,990
and that's so much more fun,
don't you agree?

467
00:21:31,057 --> 00:21:32,692
Oh, yes, much more fun.

468
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:34,260
That is a charming dress.

469
00:21:34,327 --> 00:21:36,596
Well, it's very old, I'm afraid.

470
00:21:36,663 --> 00:21:37,363
Shh!

471
00:21:37,364 --> 00:21:38,898
You like vodka?

472
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:41,233
I've never tried it.
I don't think I better.

473
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:45,872
But you must.
This is very special.

474
00:21:45,938 --> 00:21:48,741
Well, uh, cheerio.

475
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:50,610
Cheerio.

476
00:21:50,677 --> 00:21:53,446
Oh, no, no, no.
Not to sip like that.

477
00:21:53,513 --> 00:21:55,748
You'll make yourself,
as you say, uh, tiddly.

478
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:59,051
Like this, and then it
has no dangerous effect.

479
00:22:02,088 --> 00:22:04,657
No, no.
No more, please.

480
00:22:04,724 --> 00:22:06,593
Oh, one more
will not hurt a fly.

481
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:08,194
Maybe, but you know
what they say...

482
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,396
drunk as a fly?

483
00:22:09,462 --> 00:22:11,698
Oh, but that is
really quite excellent.

484
00:22:11,764 --> 00:22:14,967
I can see you have a witty
little tongue, miss Marina.

485
00:22:15,034 --> 00:22:15,834
I have?

486
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:17,537
Hurt a fly.
Drunk as a fly.

487
00:22:17,604 --> 00:22:19,138
I must remember that.

488
00:22:19,205 --> 00:22:21,941
I really shouldn't bother,
your grand ducal.

489
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:23,810
Well, uh, cheerio.

490
00:22:23,876 --> 00:22:24,977
Cheerio.

491
00:22:26,979 --> 00:22:28,247
[Coughs]

492
00:22:28,314 --> 00:22:30,116
What is the matter?

493
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:33,152
That time I burned
my witty little tongue.

494
00:22:33,219 --> 00:22:35,221
Heh heh heh.
That is very sad.

495
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:39,225
I'm really quite delighted you're here,
miss Marina. Quite delighted.

496
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:40,927
I hope you are, too.

497
00:22:40,993 --> 00:22:42,194
Enraptured.

498
00:22:42,261 --> 00:22:43,996
Ah, will you sit here?

499
00:22:45,965 --> 00:22:46,965
[Pop]

500
00:22:46,966 --> 00:22:47,966
Champagne?

501
00:22:47,967 --> 00:22:49,402
Yes.

502
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:02,081
There. Now we are to ourselves.

503
00:23:08,354 --> 00:23:10,757
Good. Well, now,
you will forgive me

504
00:23:10,823 --> 00:23:12,659
if I don't join you
for the minute.

505
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:14,093
I have already had dinner

506
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:17,864
and have one or two matters
of business to attend to.

507
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:27,540
Turned quite warm all of a sudden,
hasn't it?

508
00:23:29,642 --> 00:23:32,044
I wasn't addressed.

509
00:23:32,111 --> 00:23:34,280
Give me the ambassador.

510
00:23:34,346 --> 00:23:37,149
Very well, then wake him.

511
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:40,319
Ach, ambassador, you were asleep?
How sad.

512
00:23:40,386 --> 00:23:43,556
I wish to tell you of my interview
with the foreign secretary.

513
00:23:43,623 --> 00:23:47,059
It concerned, of course,
my having ordered the arrest of Wolffstein.

514
00:23:47,126 --> 00:23:49,095
Sir, what has disturbed
them at the moment,

515
00:23:49,161 --> 00:23:51,598
we have not been able
to think up a charge,

516
00:23:51,664 --> 00:23:53,733
which makes it rather awkward.

517
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,235
Yes, it was careless of me,
I admit,

518
00:23:56,302 --> 00:23:58,938
but I have been
so busy all evening.

519
00:23:59,005 --> 00:24:02,542
What? Yes, yes, my dear fellow,
you can speak freely.

520
00:24:02,609 --> 00:24:04,677
There's no one here.

521
00:24:04,744 --> 00:24:07,780
Uncarpathian activities.

522
00:24:07,847 --> 00:24:10,950
Heh heh heh.
Yes, that would be most amusing.

523
00:24:11,017 --> 00:24:13,052
But what has
chiefly disturbed, sir,

524
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:16,489
at what is the fact that these
stupid Americans have protested.

525
00:24:16,556 --> 00:24:21,060
Some nonsense about political
freedom and Democratic rights.

526
00:24:21,127 --> 00:24:23,362
You know what children
the Americans are

527
00:24:23,429 --> 00:24:24,564
in matters of this kind.

528
00:24:24,631 --> 00:24:26,165
Their diplomacy always makes me

529
00:24:26,232 --> 00:24:28,467
think of the minotaur legend reversed,
you know?

530
00:24:28,535 --> 00:24:34,907
The bull chasing Theseus through
the labyrinth. Heh heh heh.

531
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:39,278
A steam-traction engine
in Hampton court maze.

532
00:24:39,345 --> 00:24:40,446
Heh heh heh heh.

533
00:24:40,513 --> 00:24:42,949
Eh? Eh? Ha ha ha ha!

534
00:24:43,015 --> 00:24:45,251
Excellent. "Heh heh heh heh."

535
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:49,088
What? Oh, no. The British,
of course, will be more sensible.

536
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:52,158
They'll wait until after
the trial and then protest.

537
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:53,660
But, oh, Herr gock,

538
00:24:53,726 --> 00:24:56,462
when will these
crazy Americans grow up?

539
00:24:56,529 --> 00:25:00,166
Yes, we will talk tomorrow.
Good night.

540
00:25:03,803 --> 00:25:05,938
Well, well, well.
And how is everything?

541
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:07,139
Just dandy.

542
00:25:07,206 --> 00:25:09,676
Ach. I see you have
already served yourself.

543
00:25:09,742 --> 00:25:11,010
How remiss of me.

544
00:25:11,077 --> 00:25:12,879
Oh, not at all.
I prefer it this way.

545
00:25:12,945 --> 00:25:15,381
Splendid.
Well, uh, cheerio.

546
00:25:15,447 --> 00:25:16,515
Mud in your eye.

547
00:25:16,583 --> 00:25:19,151
[Chokes]
What a priceless expression.

548
00:25:19,218 --> 00:25:20,258
Wherever did you learn it?

549
00:25:20,286 --> 00:25:21,287
In America.

550
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:22,531
Oh, really.
Have you been there?

551
00:25:22,555 --> 00:25:23,956
I was born there.
I am American.

552
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:25,658
Are you, indeed, miss, uh...

553
00:25:25,725 --> 00:25:27,369
Yes, your grand ducal,
that's just what I am.

554
00:25:27,393 --> 00:25:30,529
Excuse me. I have thought of
another telephone call I must make.

555
00:25:30,597 --> 00:25:34,634
Oh, it's quite all right.
I just adore my own company.

556
00:25:36,603 --> 00:25:38,705
Connect me with
the French ambassador.

557
00:25:38,771 --> 00:25:41,774
Heh? Yes, he'll still
be at the reception.

558
00:25:41,841 --> 00:25:43,976
Well, I shall try later.

559
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,980
To president Taft.

560
00:25:50,917 --> 00:25:54,153
I said, to president Taft.

561
00:25:57,590 --> 00:26:00,092
[Whispering]
President Taft.

562
00:26:03,195 --> 00:26:05,464
So I wasn't addressed.

563
00:26:05,531 --> 00:26:07,867
Who cares?

564
00:26:07,934 --> 00:26:10,469
Bull in the labyrinth.

565
00:26:10,536 --> 00:26:13,372
Who the heck's Theseus, anyway?

566
00:26:13,439 --> 00:26:17,777
Protest. I should darn well
think they would protest,

567
00:26:17,844 --> 00:26:20,579
arresting people that way.

568
00:26:21,948 --> 00:26:25,484
Disgraceful.
Ah, miss Marina,

569
00:26:25,551 --> 00:26:28,154
won't you have some champagne?

570
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,956
Oh, I don't know,
your grand ducal.

571
00:26:30,022 --> 00:26:32,391
You really think I ought?

572
00:26:32,458 --> 00:26:35,662
Well, maybe just a sip.

573
00:26:35,728 --> 00:26:38,798
Maybe just up to...

574
00:26:38,865 --> 00:26:41,133
Whoa! Ha ha ha!

575
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,136
I beg your pardon.
You said something?

576
00:26:44,203 --> 00:26:48,808
Oh, no. Just playing a little
game over here all by myself.

577
00:26:48,875 --> 00:26:51,077
Good. Uh, cheerio.

578
00:26:51,143 --> 00:26:52,244
Down the hatch.

579
00:26:52,311 --> 00:26:53,311
Ha ha ha.

580
00:26:55,014 --> 00:26:58,417
Why was I not informed of
Wolffstein's arrest, father?

581
00:26:58,484 --> 00:27:00,252
Why was I left to learn it

582
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:01,954
from the London
evening standard?

583
00:27:02,021 --> 00:27:03,823
There was no need to inform you.

584
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:06,826
No need to inform the king?!

585
00:27:06,893 --> 00:27:10,062
Ah. May I present
miss Elsie Marina?

586
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:11,729
Good evening.
It's delightful to meet you.

587
00:27:11,764 --> 00:27:12,965
Won't you sit down?

588
00:27:13,032 --> 00:27:14,834
By whose orders
was Wolffstein arrested?

589
00:27:14,901 --> 00:27:16,903
By mine, of course.

590
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:19,305
He must be released immediately.

591
00:27:19,371 --> 00:27:22,842
Yes. You may be a real king very soon,
Nicky,

592
00:27:22,909 --> 00:27:25,745
but for the moment,
I'm still the ruler of Carpathia

593
00:27:25,812 --> 00:27:27,513
and of yourself.

594
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:29,949
Go to your room.

595
00:27:30,016 --> 00:27:32,685
Go to your room at once.

596
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:41,493
Good night, miss Marina.

597
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,262
It has been a great pleasure.

598
00:27:43,329 --> 00:27:45,832
Good night, your highness...
majesty.

599
00:27:48,701 --> 00:27:50,870
Colonel Hoffman.

600
00:27:51,771 --> 00:27:52,872
Hoffman.

601
00:27:52,939 --> 00:27:54,173
Go to the king's bedroom,

602
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,742
see if he's there,
and lock him in.

603
00:27:55,808 --> 00:27:57,476
Also, most important,

604
00:27:57,543 --> 00:27:59,979
put no telephone calls through to him,
inward or outward,

605
00:28:00,046 --> 00:28:01,147
until further notice.

606
00:28:01,213 --> 00:28:02,524
Understood,
your grand ducal highness.

607
00:28:02,548 --> 00:28:04,483
Will you hold a moment,
sir, please?

608
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:07,887
Queen dowager: We're just going up
to say good night to the regent.

609
00:28:07,954 --> 00:28:09,388
Her majesty
has just come in, sir,

610
00:28:09,455 --> 00:28:11,415
and is declaring her intention
of saying good night

611
00:28:11,457 --> 00:28:12,725
to your grand ducal highness.

612
00:28:12,792 --> 00:28:15,594
I see. Very well.

613
00:28:15,661 --> 00:28:17,063
The queen dowager has returned

614
00:28:17,129 --> 00:28:19,631
from St. James palace
earlier than expected

615
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,500
and is coming up in a moment.

616
00:28:21,567 --> 00:28:24,703
Huh. The queen dowag... the queen dowager?
That's your mother?

617
00:28:24,771 --> 00:28:25,671
My mother-in-law.

618
00:28:25,672 --> 00:28:27,174
Oh, that's worse.

619
00:28:27,239 --> 00:28:29,217
You... you... you...
you'll want me to hide, won't you?

620
00:28:29,241 --> 00:28:30,041
[Chuckling]

621
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:32,044
Um, where?
Uh, in there?

622
00:28:32,111 --> 00:28:33,612
Do you have a closet
or something?

623
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:35,314
My dear.

624
00:28:35,381 --> 00:28:38,350
I can see you have a very
strong sense of the dramatic.

625
00:28:38,417 --> 00:28:40,719
No, no, no.
Just sit there and calm yourself.

626
00:28:40,787 --> 00:28:42,267
Now, before you meet
my mother-in-law,

627
00:28:42,321 --> 00:28:44,323
I must warn you,
she is a little vague

628
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:47,359
and can be very deaf,
on occasions.

629
00:28:47,426 --> 00:28:49,461
My dear,

630
00:28:49,528 --> 00:28:50,963
such boredom.

631
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:52,799
The decoration's hideous,

632
00:28:52,865 --> 00:28:54,934
and the music...
catastrophe.

633
00:28:55,001 --> 00:28:58,070
Our friend, the ex-king
of Moravia, drove me home.

634
00:28:58,137 --> 00:29:00,072
He is now called
the Duke of Strelitz.

635
00:29:00,139 --> 00:29:01,917
He cannot, of course,
go to the Abbey tomorrow,

636
00:29:01,941 --> 00:29:04,944
but he is most anxious that you
should invite him to the room

637
00:29:05,011 --> 00:29:06,946
you have taken
in the Ritz for Nicky.

638
00:29:07,013 --> 00:29:08,380
Maud? Yes, ma'am?

639
00:29:08,447 --> 00:29:10,749
Oh, there you are, my dear.
I did not see you.

640
00:29:10,817 --> 00:29:14,954
Give me a glass of that
champagne that I see over there.

641
00:29:15,021 --> 00:29:17,857
Might I present
miss Elsie Marina?

642
00:29:17,924 --> 00:29:19,926
Oh, yes, my dear.
Of course.

643
00:29:19,992 --> 00:29:21,293
I remember you well.

644
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,129
Oh, I'm quite sure
you don't, your royal...

645
00:29:23,195 --> 00:29:27,633
oh, I mean, your, uh... Imperial...
your... Uh, serene majesty?

646
00:29:27,699 --> 00:29:28,968
What does she say?

647
00:29:29,035 --> 00:29:30,736
She says she is deeply flattered

648
00:29:30,803 --> 00:29:33,739
and compliments you on
your wonderful memory.

649
00:29:33,806 --> 00:29:34,874
Thank you, my dear.

650
00:29:34,941 --> 00:29:36,008
Sweetly pretty.

651
00:29:36,075 --> 00:29:37,676
She should use more mascara.

652
00:29:37,743 --> 00:29:39,979
When one is young,
one should use a lot of mascara,

653
00:29:40,046 --> 00:29:41,647
and when one is old,

654
00:29:41,713 --> 00:29:43,115
one should use much more.

655
00:29:43,182 --> 00:29:44,550
And what do you do, my dear?

656
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:47,553
I-I'm in the coconut girl
at the Avenue.

657
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:48,720
Ja?

658
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:50,022
She says she's an actress.

659
00:29:50,089 --> 00:29:53,092
An actress? That is
very interesting.

660
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:56,262
Um, madame Sarah Bernhardt
has acted for us, you know.

661
00:29:56,328 --> 00:29:59,999
Personally, I do not find her so
good in Magda as mademoiselle Duse.

662
00:30:00,066 --> 00:30:01,400
You agree, no?

663
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:04,904
No?

664
00:30:04,971 --> 00:30:06,438
You do not agree?

665
00:30:06,505 --> 00:30:07,773
That is very interesting.

666
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,408
You know Lucien Quitry, too?

667
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:11,878
No, ma'am.

668
00:30:11,944 --> 00:30:13,712
Only madame Bernhardt.

669
00:30:13,779 --> 00:30:16,219
Well, you are quite right to be
loyal to your friends, my dear.

670
00:30:16,282 --> 00:30:18,851
Loyalty is a quality that we
do not see enough nowadays.

671
00:30:18,918 --> 00:30:22,121
Tres bien.
Well, I must go to bed.

672
00:30:22,188 --> 00:30:23,890
Which uniform are
you wearing tomorrow?

673
00:30:23,956 --> 00:30:25,824
The morning
royal guards, my dear.

674
00:30:25,892 --> 00:30:27,393
Ah, now let me see what color.

675
00:30:27,459 --> 00:30:28,961
Oh, that's all right.
We won't clash.

676
00:30:29,028 --> 00:30:30,196
Good night, my dear.

677
00:30:30,262 --> 00:30:32,431
Maud? Where is that idiot?
Yes, ma'am?

678
00:30:32,498 --> 00:30:34,934
Tell my aides I am
ready to go to bed.

679
00:30:35,001 --> 00:30:36,111
Maud, you look very pinched.

680
00:30:36,135 --> 00:30:37,403
What is the matter with you?

681
00:30:37,469 --> 00:30:39,138
I fear I have
a slight cold, ma'am.

682
00:30:39,205 --> 00:30:42,108
Oh, you poor thing.
I am so very, very sorry.

683
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:43,218
I must make you one
of my syrups.

684
00:30:43,242 --> 00:30:45,144
So kind of you, ma'am.

685
00:30:45,211 --> 00:30:47,813
Idiotic creature... always catching cold.
I really can't think how.

686
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,949
As far as I know,
her life is quite blameless.

687
00:30:50,016 --> 00:30:51,550
Anyway, with a face like that...

688
00:30:51,617 --> 00:30:53,419
good night, my dear.
You are so delightful.

689
00:30:53,485 --> 00:30:54,853
Good night, ma'am.

690
00:30:54,921 --> 00:30:57,256
And just a touch more on the cheeks,
too, I think.

691
00:30:57,323 --> 00:30:58,925
Yes, ma'am.

692
00:30:58,991 --> 00:31:02,428
And don't make mischief between
me and madame Bernhardt now,

693
00:31:02,494 --> 00:31:04,330
or I shall be cross.

694
00:31:07,533 --> 00:31:10,136
Oh, a little vague?

695
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:13,339
Say, doesn't she mind
about you and me?

696
00:31:13,405 --> 00:31:15,141
Mind?

697
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:17,276
Well, isn't she
your wife's mother?

698
00:31:17,343 --> 00:31:18,610
No, my dear.

699
00:31:18,677 --> 00:31:21,647
My wife and I were married
because she needed to reinforce

700
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:24,283
her trade agreement
with Hungary.

701
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:27,753
I accepted her because
the emperor told me to.

702
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:31,257
For 10 years, we were utterly and
completely devoted to each other

703
00:31:31,323 --> 00:31:34,126
with never an unkind word
on either side.

704
00:31:34,193 --> 00:31:36,028
How could there be any question

705
00:31:36,095 --> 00:31:41,100
of anyone minding anything
in such circumstances?

706
00:31:41,167 --> 00:31:44,203
Ooh, I find your life shocking.

707
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:45,271
Why?

708
00:31:45,337 --> 00:31:47,706
Well, there's no...
Love in it.

709
00:31:47,773 --> 00:31:49,208
Nothing?

710
00:31:49,275 --> 00:31:52,244
Oh, yes,
Maisie Springfields by the dozens,

711
00:31:52,311 --> 00:31:54,180
but I mean, oh, real love.

712
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:55,447
[Telephone rings]

713
00:31:55,514 --> 00:31:56,514
Oh, excuse me.

714
00:31:56,515 --> 00:31:59,485
Oh, no, not again.

715
00:32:01,453 --> 00:32:03,155
Yes?

716
00:32:03,222 --> 00:32:07,226
Riots? My dear fellow,
there is no need to panic.

717
00:32:07,293 --> 00:32:10,429
The new chief of police is a good man,
and I trust him.

718
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:12,364
Heh? No!

719
00:32:16,068 --> 00:32:18,004
Well, my dear...

720
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:21,840
Well?

721
00:32:21,907 --> 00:32:25,311
My dear,
wouldn't you be more comfortable on the sofa?

722
00:32:25,377 --> 00:32:28,680
You could put your feet
up there and rest.

723
00:32:28,747 --> 00:32:30,016
Oh, no, thank you.

724
00:32:30,082 --> 00:32:33,885
I think I'll stay
right where I am.

725
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:35,988
Just as you please.

726
00:32:41,493 --> 00:32:43,529
[Chuckling]

727
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:51,270
My dear, it was so good of you

728
00:32:51,337 --> 00:32:54,073
to come and see me here tonight.

729
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,641
You said that before.

730
00:32:55,707 --> 00:32:56,708
Did I?

731
00:32:56,775 --> 00:32:59,511
That is a beautiful dress.

732
00:32:59,578 --> 00:33:01,747
You said that before, too.

733
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,849
Heh heh heh.
What does it matter?

734
00:33:03,915 --> 00:33:05,317
What are words,

735
00:33:05,384 --> 00:33:07,786
where deeds can
say so much more?

736
00:33:07,853 --> 00:33:11,123
[Laughing] That's just terrible,
my...

737
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:12,791
what is terrible?

738
00:33:12,858 --> 00:33:14,960
That performance of yours.

739
00:33:15,027 --> 00:33:17,496
Dear, I do not altogether
understand you, miss Marina.

740
00:33:17,563 --> 00:33:22,000
Ohh. Now, don't pull
"grand Duke" with me.

741
00:33:22,068 --> 00:33:24,070
You made a pass,
and I turned it down.

742
00:33:24,136 --> 00:33:25,337
That's all that happened.

743
00:33:25,404 --> 00:33:28,074
We can still be friendly.

744
00:33:29,708 --> 00:33:31,477
Excuse me.

745
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,782
Say, listen,
I could use a short one.

746
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:39,085
I need it for my heart.
It's kind of beating down here.

747
00:33:39,151 --> 00:33:40,519
I'm so sorry.

748
00:33:40,586 --> 00:33:42,621
It's all right.
It's not your fault.

749
00:33:42,688 --> 00:33:44,666
In fact, if I'd known this was
all that was going to happen,

750
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:47,226
I wouldn't even
have been nervous.

751
00:33:47,293 --> 00:33:49,995
Long life to your
grand highness.

752
00:33:50,062 --> 00:33:51,263
Cheerio.

753
00:33:52,764 --> 00:33:56,435
Better luck next time,
only not with me, of course.

754
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:02,374
Say, listen,
there is something to this stuff.

755
00:34:02,441 --> 00:34:04,310
Are you sure there's no effect

756
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:06,245
when you drink it that way?

757
00:34:07,646 --> 00:34:11,717
After 3 of them,
you might experience a certain euphoria.

758
00:34:11,783 --> 00:34:14,220
I think you have had enough.

759
00:34:14,286 --> 00:34:16,522
I think so, too.

760
00:34:19,625 --> 00:34:23,529
I don't know why I was
so nervous tonight.

761
00:34:23,595 --> 00:34:26,998
I thought I was gonna have a
real struggle with myself.

762
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,867
I thought...

763
00:34:28,934 --> 00:34:31,570
Well, of course, I would have won it.
I always do.

764
00:34:31,637 --> 00:34:33,439
But I thought this time...

765
00:34:33,505 --> 00:34:35,841
he's a Hungarian prince

766
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:38,009
and a grand ducal...

767
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:40,846
Well, with fire
and passion and...

768
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:44,049
I thought if...
Anybody knows about this love stuff,

769
00:34:44,116 --> 00:34:45,751
this guy will.

770
00:34:45,817 --> 00:34:48,820
Ha ha ha ha ha!

771
00:34:51,223 --> 00:34:53,091
[Suppresses a laugh]

772
00:34:54,726 --> 00:34:56,695
I even thought...

773
00:34:56,762 --> 00:34:58,730
I even thought
that you'd have...

774
00:34:58,797 --> 00:35:02,601
Gypsy violins playing somewhere outside,
and that...

775
00:35:02,668 --> 00:35:05,604
The lights would be
dimmed low and...

776
00:35:05,671 --> 00:35:09,741
There'd be strange,
seductive perfume everywhere in the air.

777
00:35:09,808 --> 00:35:11,910
Well, put it all together,
I thought,

778
00:35:11,977 --> 00:35:15,647
"mmm, sister,
you better watch your step.

779
00:35:15,714 --> 00:35:18,850
You just better watch out."

780
00:35:21,787 --> 00:35:23,322
Oh, well.

781
00:35:23,389 --> 00:35:25,524
Do they all fall
as easily as that,

782
00:35:25,591 --> 00:35:28,126
those Maisie Springfields
and all those others?

783
00:35:28,194 --> 00:35:32,130
Before your insults grow too
great to be borne, miss Marina,

784
00:35:32,198 --> 00:35:33,832
I'm ringing for your motor.

785
00:35:33,899 --> 00:35:35,534
Oh, no, don't do that.

786
00:35:35,601 --> 00:35:37,903
I mean,
I don't want you to get your car out again.

787
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:39,738
I live way out in Brixton.

788
00:35:39,805 --> 00:35:40,806
I could just walk.

789
00:35:40,872 --> 00:35:42,841
You will go in the motor!

790
00:35:42,908 --> 00:35:44,576
Ok, if you insist.

791
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:47,746
I'll just get my wrap.

792
00:35:47,813 --> 00:35:49,581
Ohh!

793
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:50,882
Sorry.

794
00:35:58,089 --> 00:35:59,858
Pretty good, huh?

795
00:36:06,198 --> 00:36:07,933
Why am I deserted?!

796
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:11,337
Why is there no one
to answer the bell?!

797
00:36:12,771 --> 00:36:13,339
Major Domo!

798
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:14,606
With respect,

799
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:15,850
your grand ducal
highness yourself

800
00:36:15,874 --> 00:36:17,209
gave orders that the attendants

801
00:36:17,276 --> 00:36:18,777
were to be moved from the door...

802
00:36:18,844 --> 00:36:22,781
see that a motor is here,
and tell the a.D.C. On duty

803
00:36:22,848 --> 00:36:25,651
he is to escort miss Marina
to a place called Brixton.

804
00:36:25,717 --> 00:36:28,854
As your grand ducal
highness commands.

805
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,656
Major Domo!

806
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:40,098
Why was this room not perfumed?

807
00:36:40,165 --> 00:36:41,600
Perfumed, your grand
ducal highness?

808
00:36:41,667 --> 00:36:43,435
And why were the lights
not turned down

809
00:36:43,502 --> 00:36:45,504
to give a romantic
and mysterious effect?

810
00:36:45,571 --> 00:36:48,173
With respect, your grand ducal
highness gave no such command.

811
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,141
Himmel!
Am I to think of everything?

812
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:52,678
Have I not enough on my mind?

813
00:36:59,985 --> 00:37:01,687
What are you doing?

814
00:37:01,753 --> 00:37:04,823
You would lock the stable door
after the horse has bolted?

815
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:07,235
If it is your grand ducal highness'
wish that the stable door be locked,

816
00:37:07,259 --> 00:37:08,803
I will instantly instruct
the head coachman...

817
00:37:08,827 --> 00:37:11,697
dummkopf! Do you not know
the English idiomatic phrase

818
00:37:11,763 --> 00:37:16,034
that it is foolish to lock the
stable door after the horse has...

819
00:37:16,101 --> 00:37:18,770
Hey? But has it?

820
00:37:31,383 --> 00:37:33,018
Give that to me.

821
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:35,987
Wait.

822
00:37:36,054 --> 00:37:38,390
One of my personal
servants plays the violin.

823
00:37:38,457 --> 00:37:39,825
Which is that?

824
00:37:39,891 --> 00:37:42,428
I think it is Franz,
your grand ducal highness.

825
00:37:42,494 --> 00:37:43,729
And does he play it well?

826
00:37:43,795 --> 00:37:45,307
I am tone deaf,
your grand ducal highness...

827
00:37:45,331 --> 00:37:46,698
where is he now?
In bed, sir.

828
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:48,885
Well, fetch him out of it,
and tell him I may need him

829
00:37:48,934 --> 00:37:50,836
to play his confounded
fiddle outside this door.

830
00:37:50,902 --> 00:37:53,004
But don't let him begin
until I ring.

831
00:37:53,071 --> 00:37:53,971
Wait!

832
00:37:53,972 --> 00:37:56,542
[Humming]

833
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:59,077
Oh, hasn't the car
gotten here yet?

834
00:37:59,144 --> 00:38:01,380
Ah, the little bird...

835
00:38:01,447 --> 00:38:04,215
So anxious to return
to her nest.

836
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:06,952
Well, this is my exit, I guess.

837
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:12,223
Please, this is not
quite yet good-bye.

838
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,826
Give me just one minute
to tell you

839
00:38:14,893 --> 00:38:18,564
how deeply distressed I feel at
what has happened between us.

840
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,732
Listen, I'm the one
who should be sorry.

841
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:23,402
Oh, please, please, let me try to
explain a little about something

842
00:38:23,469 --> 00:38:25,337
that is in my mind
at the moment.

843
00:38:25,404 --> 00:38:28,106
Won't you sit down
just for a second, huh?

844
00:38:28,173 --> 00:38:30,409
Well, I don't want to
keep those drivers up.

845
00:38:30,476 --> 00:38:32,911
Oh, that is all right.
They're used to waiting.

846
00:38:32,978 --> 00:38:34,380
It is simply this, my dear.

847
00:38:34,446 --> 00:38:38,650
I have realized that all that you
have said about my life is true.

848
00:38:38,717 --> 00:38:40,919
It is quite without love.

849
00:38:40,986 --> 00:38:44,756
I'm... I'm growing
into middle age.

850
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:46,124
Oh, no.

851
00:38:46,191 --> 00:38:48,494
Almost into middle age.

852
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,529
Hey, I didn't ask for that.

853
00:38:50,596 --> 00:38:54,833
Yes. Here am I having
reached the age of 40,

854
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:57,903
and I have never known what
it is to love or be loved.

855
00:38:57,969 --> 00:39:00,906
It is like the legend
of the sleeping Princess,

856
00:39:00,972 --> 00:39:03,442
only here it is
the prince who sleeps

857
00:39:03,509 --> 00:39:06,478
and awaits the kiss of the
beautiful young maiden

858
00:39:06,545 --> 00:39:09,381
that will bring him
back to life.

859
00:39:09,448 --> 00:39:12,050
You mean you want me
to kiss you.

860
00:39:13,485 --> 00:39:15,086
You are so literal.

861
00:39:15,153 --> 00:39:16,855
It is love that I need,

862
00:39:16,922 --> 00:39:19,825
the ennobling love
of a pure young woman,

863
00:39:19,891 --> 00:39:22,093
her bright faith in me as I am

864
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,795
and as I might yet be,

865
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:28,434
her glowing self-sacrifice to my
little weaknesses and desires...

866
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,902
for love is sacrifice,
is it not?

867
00:39:30,969 --> 00:39:31,869
[Rings bell]

868
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:34,606
Yes. And where is
the mystic kiss

869
00:39:34,673 --> 00:39:37,976
which might bring this
sleeping prince to life?

870
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:43,715
I got you.

871
00:39:43,782 --> 00:39:46,918
Do you know what
your hair reminds me of?

872
00:39:46,985 --> 00:39:48,086
[Violin playing]

873
00:39:48,153 --> 00:39:50,689
Summer corn, kissed by the wind

874
00:39:50,756 --> 00:39:54,192
into enchantingly
exciting furrow...

875
00:39:54,259 --> 00:39:55,594
Your eyes...

876
00:39:55,661 --> 00:39:56,461
Hey!

877
00:39:56,462 --> 00:39:57,663
Hmm?

878
00:39:57,729 --> 00:39:59,631
Where is that music coming from?

879
00:39:59,698 --> 00:40:03,469
Music? Oh.
One of my servants, a Hungarian,

880
00:40:03,535 --> 00:40:06,071
always plays at this hour.

881
00:40:06,137 --> 00:40:09,074
He's lamenting his lost love.

882
00:40:13,044 --> 00:40:14,379
Ohh.

883
00:40:14,446 --> 00:40:16,414
Poor boy.

884
00:40:16,482 --> 00:40:19,585
Isn't life awful?

885
00:40:19,651 --> 00:40:22,387
Go back to my eyes.

886
00:40:22,454 --> 00:40:25,857
Twin pools of gladness and joy

887
00:40:25,924 --> 00:40:29,394
in which any man would be
happy to drown himself.

888
00:40:29,461 --> 00:40:30,729
In both of them?

889
00:40:30,796 --> 00:40:32,664
[Laughing]
In either.

890
00:40:32,731 --> 00:40:35,433
Oh, I like that.
Twin pools.

891
00:40:35,501 --> 00:40:36,267
Go on.

892
00:40:36,268 --> 00:40:38,070
Ah, your chin...

893
00:40:38,136 --> 00:40:42,841
Oh, you skipped my nose because
you noticed the bump on the end.

894
00:40:42,908 --> 00:40:44,242
Oh, no, no, no.

895
00:40:44,309 --> 00:40:48,580
I left it out because there is
nothing to say of perfection.

896
00:40:48,647 --> 00:40:51,182
Oh, that's nice.

897
00:40:51,249 --> 00:40:52,984
Back to my chin.

898
00:40:53,051 --> 00:40:55,954
This is what I think
of your chin.

899
00:40:58,156 --> 00:41:00,358
My darling.

900
00:41:00,425 --> 00:41:03,228
Oh, my darling.

901
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:06,264
[Violin continues playing]

902
00:41:06,331 --> 00:41:08,900
Oh, that poor Hungarian!

903
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:11,537
I do hope he gets his love back.

904
00:41:11,603 --> 00:41:12,938
Well, don't think of his love.

905
00:41:13,004 --> 00:41:15,306
Think of ours,
my darling, you know?

906
00:41:15,373 --> 00:41:17,475
Think of our love and the
beauty of our meeting here.

907
00:41:17,543 --> 00:41:19,110
Ooh, you have pretty hair.

908
00:41:19,177 --> 00:41:20,478
Ah, you think so, huh?

909
00:41:20,546 --> 00:41:21,780
You like my hair?

910
00:41:21,847 --> 00:41:24,315
You use the wrong stuff
on it, though.

911
00:41:24,382 --> 00:41:25,450
What do you use?

912
00:41:25,517 --> 00:41:26,918
A little pomade, dear, but...

913
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:29,320
that's where you're wrong.
You should use, um...

914
00:41:29,387 --> 00:41:31,256
oh, what's the name
of that stuff?

915
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:32,658
What's the name of it?

916
00:41:32,724 --> 00:41:34,560
Oh, I know!
Uh, pinaud's lilac.

917
00:41:34,626 --> 00:41:35,994
Huh? Ah.

918
00:41:36,061 --> 00:41:38,429
So remember what I was
asking you, my darling...

919
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:39,765
to remember our love.

920
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:41,700
Oh, you have pretty eyebrows.

921
00:41:41,767 --> 00:41:44,302
"Love"...
what a universe of joy and pain

922
00:41:44,369 --> 00:41:46,204
lies in that little word.

923
00:42:13,498 --> 00:42:14,538
Your grand ducal highness!

924
00:42:14,566 --> 00:42:16,167
This is intolerable!

925
00:42:16,234 --> 00:42:18,212
My deepest respects, sir.
My message is so important,

926
00:42:18,236 --> 00:42:19,476
I had no choice but to intrude.

927
00:42:19,504 --> 00:42:21,106
Revolution?!
No, sir.

928
00:42:21,172 --> 00:42:23,012
Miss Marina's aunt has
been in a motor accident.

929
00:42:23,074 --> 00:42:26,211
The hospital is calling
for her most urgently.

930
00:42:26,277 --> 00:42:27,278
What?

931
00:42:27,345 --> 00:42:31,249
Oh, go away, you silly lad.

932
00:42:31,316 --> 00:42:33,585
[Giggling]

933
00:42:33,652 --> 00:42:35,854
But, miss Marina, your aunt.

934
00:42:35,921 --> 00:42:38,323
Do you realize how
serious her condition is?

935
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:41,326
Well, it's her own fault.
She has no right out this time of night.

936
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:42,226
She's 93.

937
00:42:42,227 --> 00:42:43,193
Miss Marina...

938
00:42:43,194 --> 00:42:44,863
miss Marina asked
you to go away,

939
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:46,164
and I command you to go away.

940
00:42:46,231 --> 00:42:47,899
I am most horribly displeased

941
00:42:47,966 --> 00:42:49,176
at this breach of etiquette,
Mr. Northbrook,

942
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,936
and shall no doubt
find opportunity

943
00:42:51,002 --> 00:42:53,038
of expressing my displeasure
in certain quarters.

944
00:42:53,104 --> 00:42:55,073
Your grand ducal highness... go!

945
00:42:59,077 --> 00:43:00,211
[Giggling]

946
00:43:04,549 --> 00:43:06,785
My dear...

947
00:43:06,852 --> 00:43:08,086
Ooh.

948
00:43:08,153 --> 00:43:10,722
I got a solemn word
of warning for you.

949
00:43:10,789 --> 00:43:13,659
What is that, my beloved?

950
00:43:13,725 --> 00:43:16,862
You know what's going to happen?

951
00:43:16,928 --> 00:43:19,831
I'm gonna fall in love with you,

952
00:43:19,898 --> 00:43:22,033
'cause I always, always do.

953
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:23,301
Always?

954
00:43:23,368 --> 00:43:26,571
Hmm. Both times.

955
00:43:26,638 --> 00:43:29,474
So, you better watch out.

956
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:32,778
You better watch out.

957
00:43:36,281 --> 00:43:40,318
Oh! What pretty cherubs
on the ceiling!

958
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:45,356
Good night, my darling.

959
00:43:45,423 --> 00:43:47,258
Good night.

960
00:43:47,325 --> 00:43:50,095
See you in the morning.

961
00:43:51,429 --> 00:43:52,931
Major Domo!

962
00:43:52,998 --> 00:43:55,133
[Violin continues playing]

963
00:44:24,029 --> 00:44:25,997
Stop that infernal din!

964
00:44:26,064 --> 00:44:29,200
How do you expect a man
to get any sleep?

965
00:45:08,339 --> 00:45:09,339
[Bell rings]

966
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:10,375
Good morning, sir.

967
00:45:21,452 --> 00:45:23,388
[Whispering urgently]

968
00:45:31,429 --> 00:45:32,864
Good gracious.

969
00:45:34,265 --> 00:45:35,666
Ah, good morning,
Mr. Northbrook.

970
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:37,202
Good morning, sir.

971
00:45:37,268 --> 00:45:39,180
Uh, my father has sent for me.
You think I should go in?

972
00:45:39,204 --> 00:45:40,381
I think, sir,
perhaps you'd better not.

973
00:45:40,405 --> 00:45:41,706
I understand from the major Domo

974
00:45:41,773 --> 00:45:43,408
that his valets are with him.

975
00:45:43,474 --> 00:45:45,476
They're having a little
trouble with his shaving.

976
00:46:02,527 --> 00:46:05,696
Promising weather for the coronation,
don't you think so, sir?

977
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:07,332
Pity you can't
go into the Abbey,

978
00:46:07,398 --> 00:46:09,467
but, of course,
protocol forbids it.

979
00:46:09,534 --> 00:46:12,838
I understand you're watching the procession
from a window in the Ritz hotel.

980
00:46:12,904 --> 00:46:15,440
You should have
an exceptionally good view.

981
00:46:15,506 --> 00:46:17,475
Who is accompanying
your majesty?

982
00:46:17,542 --> 00:46:20,711
The Duke of Strelitz...
And, of course, my jailer.

983
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:22,914
Your jailer, sir?

984
00:46:22,981 --> 00:46:24,182
Colonel Hoffman.

985
00:46:24,249 --> 00:46:26,852
Charles: Is that you, Nicky?

986
00:46:26,918 --> 00:46:28,486
Yes, father.

987
00:46:30,889 --> 00:46:32,657
Good morning, Nicky.

988
00:46:32,723 --> 00:46:34,923
I've been thinking things over,
and it seems to me better

989
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,703
you do not have Strelitz
with you this morning.

990
00:46:36,727 --> 00:46:39,130
But, father,
I do not want to be alone with Hoffman.

991
00:46:39,197 --> 00:46:40,365
I know.

992
00:46:40,431 --> 00:46:42,043
Strelitz is my cousin,
and I have not seen him

993
00:46:42,067 --> 00:46:43,768
since his...
since his abdication.

994
00:46:43,835 --> 00:46:45,847
Yeah, I know, dear boy, you are very
fond of him, but I really think...

995
00:46:45,871 --> 00:46:50,475
dummkopf! Am I to go to the coronation
looking like a sliced tomato?!

996
00:47:01,552 --> 00:47:02,854
[Knock on door]

997
00:47:14,799 --> 00:47:16,001
Aye?

998
00:47:16,067 --> 00:47:18,203
[Speaking Hungarian]

999
00:47:21,306 --> 00:47:23,909
Nicky, when in England,
we speak only English.

1000
00:47:23,975 --> 00:47:26,777
[Shouting in Hungarian]

1001
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:28,980
In any case, Nicky,
I believe you are merely sulking

1002
00:47:29,047 --> 00:47:31,049
because of Wolffstein's arrest.

1003
00:47:31,116 --> 00:47:33,551
That issue is far too important
for me as sulking, father.

1004
00:47:33,618 --> 00:47:35,186
Will you please tell me

1005
00:47:35,253 --> 00:47:37,133
what has happened in my
country since last night?

1006
00:47:37,188 --> 00:47:39,457
The riots are still continuing,

1007
00:47:39,524 --> 00:47:41,392
and that they appear
to be well organized,

1008
00:47:41,459 --> 00:47:45,530
I have had no option but to
order certain further arrests.

1009
00:47:45,596 --> 00:47:46,864
Further arrests?

1010
00:47:46,932 --> 00:47:50,668
Yes. I have the list
here, I think.

1011
00:47:50,735 --> 00:47:52,603
Yes, here it is.

1012
00:48:01,046 --> 00:48:04,315
No friends of yours there,
I hope.

1013
00:48:04,382 --> 00:48:07,652
I am not allowed to have
politicians for friends, father.

1014
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:09,187
You know that.

1015
00:48:09,254 --> 00:48:11,556
Thank you so much,
Mr. Northbrook.

1016
00:48:13,091 --> 00:48:16,494
Oh, I wonder who it is
I have left off this list.

1017
00:48:16,561 --> 00:48:18,196
There was some name
he was looking for

1018
00:48:18,263 --> 00:48:21,732
and relieved to find not there.

1019
00:48:21,799 --> 00:48:23,034
Shh.

1020
00:48:23,101 --> 00:48:25,170
[Speaking Hungarian]

1021
00:49:18,556 --> 00:49:19,590
Northbrook!

1022
00:49:19,657 --> 00:49:20,691
Sir?

1023
00:49:20,758 --> 00:49:22,860
Do I see what I saw?

1024
00:49:22,927 --> 00:49:24,495
I fear so, sir. Yes.

1025
00:49:24,562 --> 00:49:26,764
But why has she not
been got rid of, huh?

1026
00:49:26,831 --> 00:49:28,699
I understand, sir,
her sleep was unduly heavy

1027
00:49:28,766 --> 00:49:30,768
and resistant
to prodding and shaking...

1028
00:49:30,835 --> 00:49:32,779
she cannot be seen here
at this hour of the morning.

1029
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:33,838
She will make a scandal.

1030
00:49:33,904 --> 00:49:35,184
Suppose the queen
is in that room

1031
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:36,783
and she comes out again
looking like that, huh?

1032
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:38,643
I'm sure, sir,
her sense of comme il faut...

1033
00:49:38,709 --> 00:49:42,313
she has as much sense of comme
il faut as a rhinoceros.

1034
00:49:43,548 --> 00:49:44,615
Do I gather, sir,

1035
00:49:44,682 --> 00:49:48,019
that the evening was not
an entirely happy one?

1036
00:49:49,387 --> 00:49:52,090
Northbrook, this British
understatement of yours

1037
00:49:52,157 --> 00:49:53,824
I begin to find irritating.

1038
00:49:53,891 --> 00:49:56,027
The evening was an
unqualified nightmare.

1039
00:49:56,094 --> 00:49:57,195
Oh, I'm so sorry, sir.

1040
00:49:57,262 --> 00:49:59,164
I have only one evening
in London,

1041
00:49:59,230 --> 00:50:00,598
one single evening

1042
00:50:00,665 --> 00:50:02,900
in which to arrange for
myself a little relaxation,

1043
00:50:02,967 --> 00:50:04,169
and what happens?

1044
00:50:04,235 --> 00:50:06,671
Out of the whole of
this vast, teeming city,

1045
00:50:06,737 --> 00:50:09,240
teeming with beautiful,
intelligent women,

1046
00:50:09,307 --> 00:50:12,443
you find me what?
A little American ninnycompoop.

1047
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:15,746
With respect, sir,
either "ninny" by itself or "nincompoop."

1048
00:50:15,813 --> 00:50:17,148
"Ninnycompoop" will serve.

1049
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:19,350
She fully deserves a new word.

1050
00:50:19,417 --> 00:50:21,586
The mind of a backward child,

1051
00:50:21,652 --> 00:50:22,920
the muscles of a boxer,

1052
00:50:22,987 --> 00:50:24,622
and an approach to life

1053
00:50:24,689 --> 00:50:27,024
of such stomach-turning
sentimentality

1054
00:50:27,092 --> 00:50:28,426
that I found myself, Northbrook,

1055
00:50:28,493 --> 00:50:31,229
I found myself last night
uttering phrases

1056
00:50:31,296 --> 00:50:33,464
which had any single one
of them been overheard

1057
00:50:33,531 --> 00:50:35,766
would have made me
the laughingstock of Europe.

1058
00:50:35,833 --> 00:50:37,235
And to crown it all,

1059
00:50:37,302 --> 00:50:40,571
she is rendered insensible
by an amount of vodka

1060
00:50:40,638 --> 00:50:42,107
which in Carpathia

1061
00:50:42,173 --> 00:50:44,775
you would add to the morning
milk of a 4-year-old child

1062
00:50:44,842 --> 00:50:46,411
as a mild tonic!

1063
00:50:46,477 --> 00:50:48,546
And, gott, how maddening

1064
00:50:48,613 --> 00:50:51,216
to think how overjoyed Lucy
sunningdale would have been

1065
00:50:51,282 --> 00:50:54,419
if I had asked her to have a little
supper with me here last night.

1066
00:50:54,485 --> 00:50:56,254
I'd like to remind
your grand ducal highness

1067
00:50:56,321 --> 00:50:57,755
I think I heard you remark

1068
00:50:57,822 --> 00:51:00,691
that you found lady Sunningdale...
Old hat.

1069
00:51:00,758 --> 00:51:03,060
I have no doubt at
all that I did.

1070
00:51:03,128 --> 00:51:04,962
Nevertheless,
my dear Northbrook,

1071
00:51:05,029 --> 00:51:06,664
there is an old Russian saying...

1072
00:51:06,731 --> 00:51:10,401
"better an old hat
than a bare head."

1073
00:51:10,468 --> 00:51:12,437
And telephone
to lady Sunningdale

1074
00:51:12,503 --> 00:51:15,005
and ask her to join me
here tonight for supper.

1075
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:17,142
But, sir, the coronation ball...

1076
00:51:17,208 --> 00:51:19,777
I shall make a token appearance
and leave in good time,

1077
00:51:19,844 --> 00:51:21,045
say about 12:30.

1078
00:51:21,112 --> 00:51:23,013
But, sir, tonight,
coronation night,

1079
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:24,515
she may well have an engagement.

1080
00:51:24,582 --> 00:51:26,184
She will break it.

1081
00:51:27,185 --> 00:51:29,420
Elsie: Good morning.

1082
00:51:29,487 --> 00:51:31,989
That's his room
in there, isn't it?

1083
00:51:32,056 --> 00:51:33,424
Yes, but, miss Marina...

1084
00:51:33,491 --> 00:51:35,626
but I've just got to say
good morning.

1085
00:51:35,693 --> 00:51:36,794
Charles: Who is that?

1086
00:51:36,861 --> 00:51:37,761
Guess who.

1087
00:51:37,762 --> 00:51:39,130
Oh, gott!

1088
00:51:42,667 --> 00:51:43,801
Good morning, my dear.

1089
00:51:43,868 --> 00:51:44,534
Oh, good morning.

1090
00:51:44,535 --> 00:51:45,703
How are you?

1091
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:47,281
Oh, you poor darling,
you've cut yourself.

1092
00:51:47,305 --> 00:51:48,506
It is nothing.

1093
00:51:48,573 --> 00:51:51,609
Oh, but you still
look lovely to me.

1094
00:51:51,676 --> 00:51:52,476
What's the matter?

1095
00:51:52,477 --> 00:51:54,212
Uh, someone might come in.

1096
00:51:54,279 --> 00:51:55,780
Oh, this is Times Square.

1097
00:51:55,846 --> 00:51:56,957
I found that out last night.

1098
00:51:56,981 --> 00:51:57,982
But who cares?

1099
00:51:58,048 --> 00:51:59,250
But this is the morning.

1100
00:51:59,317 --> 00:52:00,785
It's different, you know?

1101
00:52:00,851 --> 00:52:01,751
What's different about it?

1102
00:52:01,752 --> 00:52:02,652
Unless maybe it's you.

1103
00:52:02,653 --> 00:52:03,988
No, I assure you, my dear,

1104
00:52:04,054 --> 00:52:05,523
I'm exactly the same person.

1105
00:52:05,590 --> 00:52:07,458
You're not acting
exactly the same way.

1106
00:52:07,525 --> 00:52:08,859
But this is the morning.

1107
00:52:08,926 --> 00:52:10,761
You keep saying that.

1108
00:52:10,828 --> 00:52:13,964
I remember last night,
the way you kept repeating yourself.

1109
00:52:14,031 --> 00:52:15,933
Tell me, my darling grand Duke,

1110
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,402
is it only very late at night

1111
00:52:17,468 --> 00:52:19,036
that you're such
a lonely person,

1112
00:52:19,103 --> 00:52:22,707
you feel the need to share your
life with a pure young woman,

1113
00:52:22,773 --> 00:52:24,275
no, no, please.
Whose bright face...

1114
00:52:24,342 --> 00:52:25,376
Ennobling love...

1115
00:52:25,443 --> 00:52:26,677
there are certain phrases

1116
00:52:26,744 --> 00:52:28,313
should never be quoted
out of context.

1117
00:52:28,379 --> 00:52:29,539
I don't know what that means.

1118
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:30,948
Oh, yes I do.

1119
00:52:31,015 --> 00:52:33,017
It means it's the morning.

1120
00:52:33,083 --> 00:52:34,752
Doesn't it?

1121
00:52:34,819 --> 00:52:38,623
Anyway, to me, it's
still dream time.

1122
00:52:38,689 --> 00:52:41,659
This coronation day, 1911,

1123
00:52:41,726 --> 00:52:46,030
I woke up to find myself
madly in love with you.

1124
00:52:46,096 --> 00:52:47,232
But madly.

1125
00:52:47,298 --> 00:52:49,033
So there.

1126
00:52:49,099 --> 00:52:52,570
My dear, I'm overwhelmed, of course,
but, alas, I feel it my duty...

1127
00:52:52,637 --> 00:52:54,605
oh, don't make
another long speech,

1128
00:52:54,672 --> 00:52:55,816
although some of them last night

1129
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:57,742
made more sense than you know.

1130
00:52:57,808 --> 00:53:00,545
You know, you do need
more love in your life.

1131
00:53:00,611 --> 00:53:03,381
I never met anyone
who needed it more.

1132
00:53:03,448 --> 00:53:04,949
So now you've got it,

1133
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:06,217
good luck to you.

1134
00:53:06,284 --> 00:53:07,518
Cheerio.

1135
00:53:07,585 --> 00:53:08,795
Is that all you're going to say?

1136
00:53:08,819 --> 00:53:11,389
Oh, my dear, of course
I'm overwhelmed,

1137
00:53:11,456 --> 00:53:14,292
but, alas, we have
so little time together.

1138
00:53:14,359 --> 00:53:16,961
I must leave tomorrow
for Carpathia.

1139
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:17,661
Tomorrow?

1140
00:53:17,662 --> 00:53:18,763
Mmm.

1141
00:53:18,829 --> 00:53:20,665
Oh, well. As soon
as the show's over,

1142
00:53:20,731 --> 00:53:21,866
I'll rush right over.

1143
00:53:21,932 --> 00:53:22,732
That's a promise.

1144
00:53:22,733 --> 00:53:23,734
Splendid.

1145
00:53:23,801 --> 00:53:26,404
Anyway, we still
have today, haven't we?

1146
00:53:27,838 --> 00:53:30,808
Well, now, you see,
my dear miss Marina...

1147

1148
00:53:31,876 --> 00:53:33,911

Ah. Well, alas, beloved...

oh,
don't go on saying alas in that phony way.

Oops. Here we go.

1152
00:53:40,251 --> 00:53:41,452
We have precisely 7 minutes.

1153
00:53:41,519 --> 00:53:42,687
Oh, gott, I must get ready.

1154
00:53:42,753 --> 00:53:44,154
And so, alas...

1155

I mean I'm afraid we must
say our little adieus.

1156
00:53:47,392 --> 00:53:49,460
Ok, honey. You go get
into your costume,

1157
00:53:49,527 --> 00:53:52,473
and don't forget, I'm going to be sitting
right outside of the Avenue theater.

1158
00:53:52,497 --> 00:53:53,798
That's where you came
last night.

1159
00:53:53,864 --> 00:53:56,434
That's just opposite
the new admiralty arch,

1160
00:53:56,501 --> 00:53:59,036
so don't forget to wave
to me, will you?

1161
00:53:59,103 --> 00:54:00,371
I will remember.

1162
00:54:04,642 --> 00:54:06,844
Oh, say, could you get me
an old raincoat somewhere?

1163
00:54:06,911 --> 00:54:08,579
Raincoat?

1164
00:54:08,646 --> 00:54:11,015
Yes, I can't very well go
down the street this way.

1165
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:12,281
I see your point, miss Marina.

1166
00:54:12,317 --> 00:54:13,918
I'll try and find you
an old mackintosh,

1167

1221
00:57:36,987 --> 00:57:39,123
Sooner, miss Marina?

1222
00:57:39,189 --> 00:57:40,189
Yes.

1223
00:57:40,190 --> 00:57:41,759
I speak German.

1224
00:57:41,826 --> 00:57:43,894
I was born in Milwaukee.

1225
00:57:43,961 --> 00:57:46,664
You're going to turn your
father out on August 15

1226
00:57:46,731 --> 00:57:49,066
and make yourself a real king.

1227
00:57:49,133 --> 00:57:51,669
The Bulgarian army's
going down to help you.

1228
00:57:51,736 --> 00:57:54,171
It is most unfortunate that
you should have heard that.

1229
00:57:54,238 --> 00:57:56,473
It might prove exceedingly
dangerous for you.

1230
00:57:56,541 --> 00:57:59,343
Dangerous? Oh,
don't give me that.

1231
00:57:59,409 --> 00:58:00,511
I'm an American citizen.

1232
00:58:00,578 --> 00:58:02,179
Nobody can do anything to me.

1233
00:58:02,246 --> 00:58:05,149
Besides,
who cares about your old Balkan revolutions?

1234
00:58:05,215 --> 00:58:07,051
You have them
all the time, anyway.

1235
00:58:07,117 --> 00:58:08,619
You... ahem...

1236
00:58:09,887 --> 00:58:12,890
You are going to
tell father, of course.

1237
00:58:12,957 --> 00:58:14,959
Depends if I get the chance.

1238
00:58:15,025 --> 00:58:16,927
[Bugle blows] Miss Marina,
I beg of you...

1239
00:58:16,994 --> 00:58:18,095
oh, excuse me.

1240
00:58:18,162 --> 00:58:19,964
[Women shouting]

1241
00:58:21,966 --> 00:58:23,467
Hello, Fanny!
Hiya, girls!

1242
00:58:23,534 --> 00:58:25,069
You all right?

1243
00:58:25,135 --> 00:58:27,113
Of course I'm all right.
What, are you worried about me?

1244
00:58:27,137 --> 00:58:28,906
Worried?
I didn't sleep a wink last night,

1245
00:58:28,973 --> 00:58:31,075
so this morning I went to
collect a rescue squad.

1246
00:58:31,141 --> 00:58:33,143
Oh, I don't need any rescuing.

1247
00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:34,579
I'm having a lovely time.

1248
00:58:34,645 --> 00:58:36,881
Elsie, you're a wicked girl.

1249
00:58:36,947 --> 00:58:38,716
Oh, no, I'm not. Not yet.

1250
00:58:38,783 --> 00:58:39,817
Well, come down at once.

1251
00:58:39,884 --> 00:58:42,086
We're terribly late as it is.

1252
00:58:42,152 --> 00:58:43,353
Ok, you run ahead.

1253
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:45,923
I have to say my one last
good-bye to my regent.

1254
00:58:45,990 --> 00:58:47,858
Fanny: What's he like, Elsie?

1255
00:58:47,925 --> 00:58:50,060
Elsie: He's the cutest
grand Duke in the world.

1256
00:58:50,127 --> 00:58:51,127
Is he nice?

1257
00:58:51,161 --> 00:58:53,664
No, not really,
just kind of cute.

1258
00:58:53,731 --> 00:58:54,865
Like the ones on the stage?

1259
00:58:54,932 --> 00:58:56,601
He's not like that at all.

1260
00:58:56,667 --> 00:58:59,369
He hasn't any sense of humor
and not a bit of charm.

1261
00:58:59,436 --> 00:59:00,571
What? What?
What?

1262
00:59:00,638 --> 00:59:02,472
Well, why do you find him
so cute, then?

1263
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:03,874
I don't know.
I just do.

1264
00:59:03,941 --> 00:59:06,076
In fact, I love him so much,
I could eat him,

1265
00:59:06,143 --> 00:59:07,077
just chew him up.

1266
00:59:07,078 --> 00:59:08,446
[Women giggle]

1267
00:59:08,512 --> 00:59:11,315
Don't let anybody get my seat.
Run along, now.

1268
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:12,381
Women: Bye, Elsie.

1269
00:59:13,884 --> 00:59:15,986
But I have a very good
sense of humor!

1270
00:59:16,053 --> 00:59:18,022
Oh! Oh, of course
you have,

1271
00:59:18,088 --> 00:59:19,590
but it's kind of a Balkan one,

1272
00:59:19,657 --> 00:59:21,626
just as good as ours,
but different.

1273
00:59:21,692 --> 00:59:24,629
And, well, you shouldn't listen to
private conversations.

1274
00:59:24,695 --> 00:59:26,272
Nicky, what are you
doing standing about?

1275
00:59:26,296 --> 00:59:28,699
You should be on your way.

1276
00:59:28,766 --> 00:59:29,900
Yes, father.

1277
00:59:43,113 --> 00:59:44,148
Here.

1278
00:59:44,214 --> 00:59:45,214
What's this?

1279
00:59:45,215 --> 00:59:46,617
A small parting gift.

1280
00:59:46,684 --> 00:59:49,186
I was going to present it to you
with a few appropriate words,

1281
00:59:49,253 --> 00:59:51,622
but now you have driven them
clean out of my head.

1282
00:59:51,689 --> 00:59:52,923
Oh, it's beautiful.

1283
00:59:52,990 --> 00:59:55,025
With your crest and everything.

1284
00:59:55,092 --> 00:59:56,092
It is nothing.

1285
00:59:56,093 --> 00:59:57,928
I don't want to say anything,

1286
00:59:57,995 --> 00:59:59,840
but I'll bet there are
quite a few of these things

1287
00:59:59,864 --> 01:00:02,466
being worn around Europe these days,
huh?

1288
01:00:02,532 --> 01:00:03,934
Oh, not Maisie Springfield.

1289
01:00:04,001 --> 01:00:05,569
Oh, well, I can't complain.

1290
01:00:05,636 --> 01:00:08,472
After all, she really earned hers,
didn't she?

1291
01:00:08,538 --> 01:00:10,140
Pin it on for me, please.

1292
01:00:27,057 --> 01:00:30,360
This is where I wake up,
I guess, isn't it?

1293
01:00:30,427 --> 01:00:32,629
I fear so, my dear.

1294
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:38,235
Yes, uh, ok, well...

1295
01:00:38,302 --> 01:00:39,904
Guess that's my cue.

1296
01:00:41,338 --> 01:00:42,338
Good-bye.

1297
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:45,810
It has been wonderful
knowing you.

1298
01:00:45,876 --> 01:00:48,679
If only it could have
lasted longer.

1299
01:00:50,014 --> 01:00:51,782
[Giggling]

1300
01:00:51,849 --> 01:00:53,718
What's the matter?
I've said something wrong?

1301
01:00:53,784 --> 01:00:56,153
No, you spoke
your line beautifully.

1302
01:00:56,220 --> 01:00:58,222
It's your medals.
They're tickling me.

1303
01:00:58,288 --> 01:01:00,290
Why do you always
say such things?!

1304
01:01:00,357 --> 01:01:02,192
You seem to enjoy
disconcerting me.

1305
01:01:02,259 --> 01:01:05,095
That is one thing I cannot bear,
to be disconcerted.

1306
01:01:05,162 --> 01:01:07,331
See that her majesty is ready.
We leave in 2 minutes.

1307
01:01:07,397 --> 01:01:08,632
Her majesty is ready.

1308
01:01:08,699 --> 01:01:10,010
And the motor to take
the king to the Ritz?

1309
01:01:10,034 --> 01:01:11,034
He has already left.

1310
01:01:11,035 --> 01:01:12,436
Miss Marina...
[Clicks heels]

1311
01:01:17,241 --> 01:01:18,241
[Door slams]

1312
01:01:25,015 --> 01:01:27,051
This is all I can
find, I'm afraid.

1313
01:01:27,117 --> 01:01:28,618
Belongs to the housekeeper.

1314
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:30,821
Oh, it'll do just fine, thanks.

1315
01:01:32,723 --> 01:01:34,058
Oh, dear.

1316
01:01:34,124 --> 01:01:36,560
Life is rather sad
sometimes, isn't it?

1317
01:01:36,626 --> 01:01:38,162
Sometimes.

1318
01:01:41,365 --> 01:01:42,499
I'm so late now,

1319
01:01:42,566 --> 01:01:44,201
I'll never get there on time.

1320
01:01:47,772 --> 01:01:49,373
Oh, gosh!

1321
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:51,842
Who was that?
Mr. Northbrook, who was that creature?

1322
01:01:51,909 --> 01:01:53,543
Was it an anarchist?

1323
01:01:53,610 --> 01:01:54,410
No, ma'am.

1324
01:01:54,411 --> 01:01:55,980
Then who was it?

1325
01:01:56,046 --> 01:01:59,049
A young lady, ma'am,
called miss Elsie Marina.

1326
01:01:59,116 --> 01:02:00,116
Ah.

1327
01:02:01,651 --> 01:02:03,020
Fetch her to me.

1328
01:02:06,891 --> 01:02:08,692
Miss Marina.

1329
01:02:08,759 --> 01:02:11,461
Her majesty wishes
to speak to you.

1330
01:02:13,864 --> 01:02:15,399
Miss Marina.

1331
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:44,394
Good morning, my dear.

1332
01:02:44,461 --> 01:02:46,263
So delightful to see you again.

1333
01:02:46,330 --> 01:02:50,034
Why are you dressed up
as a revolutionary?

1334
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:51,836
Is this a new game?

1335
01:02:51,902 --> 01:02:53,737
If it is,
you should have let me know.

1336
01:02:53,804 --> 01:02:55,139
I love games.

1337
01:02:55,205 --> 01:02:56,907
Elsie: No, ma'am.
It's not a game.

1338
01:02:56,974 --> 01:02:59,143
Well, take that thing off.

1339
01:02:59,209 --> 01:03:01,111
It looks most unbecoming.

1340
01:03:04,114 --> 01:03:05,434
Queen dowager:
Come here, my dear.

1341
01:03:08,152 --> 01:03:10,787
I am going to have a cigarette.

1342
01:03:10,855 --> 01:03:12,556
So soothing
before a long ordeal.

1343
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:14,358
Will you join me?

1344
01:03:14,424 --> 01:03:15,424
No, thank you.

1345
01:03:15,425 --> 01:03:16,961
Well, please sit down.

1346
01:03:21,298 --> 01:03:23,333
Oh, ma'am is probably wondering

1347
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:26,503
why I'm still dressed the way
I was last night.

1348
01:03:26,570 --> 01:03:29,573
You see,
I had a stupid accident with my latchkey.

1349
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:31,075
What does she say?

1350
01:03:31,141 --> 01:03:33,210
Said she had an accident with her latchkey,
ma'am.

1351
01:03:33,277 --> 01:03:34,320
And what is a latchkey?
Well, ma'am, it's...

1352
01:03:34,344 --> 01:03:35,779
oh, it does not matter.

1353
01:03:35,846 --> 01:03:37,882
I'm sure it is
something very dull.

1354
01:03:37,948 --> 01:03:40,650
Such irritating news,
Mr. Northbrook, this morning.

1355
01:03:40,717 --> 01:03:41,761
Maud Wollenzu meisen-braun,

1356
01:03:41,785 --> 01:03:42,920
my chief lady-in-waiting,

1357
01:03:42,987 --> 01:03:44,855
claims she cannot leave her bed.

1358
01:03:44,922 --> 01:03:49,226
So I have no option but to take
the baroness brunnheim to the Abbey.

1359
01:03:49,293 --> 01:03:51,228
It is not, of course, her fault,

1360
01:03:51,295 --> 01:03:54,464
but I feel we shall be very
squashed in the carriage.

1361
01:03:54,531 --> 01:03:56,166
[Speaking French]

1362
01:04:06,043 --> 01:04:07,244
Excuse me, ma'am.

1363
01:04:07,311 --> 01:04:09,279
I didn't quite catch that.

1364
01:04:09,346 --> 01:04:12,249
I don't think miss Marina speaks French,
ma'am.

1365
01:04:12,316 --> 01:04:14,418
Doesn't speak French?
How ridiculous.

1366
01:04:14,484 --> 01:04:17,721
She lives with Sarah
Bernhardt in Paris.

1367
01:04:17,787 --> 01:04:19,423
[Speaking French]

1368
01:04:28,765 --> 01:04:29,765
Oui.

1369
01:04:29,766 --> 01:04:31,735
You see?

1370
01:04:31,801 --> 01:04:33,570
[Speaking French]

1371
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:44,713
Oui.

1372
01:04:44,714 --> 01:04:45,714
Bien.

1373
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:47,151
[Speaking French]

1374
01:04:57,727 --> 01:04:59,863
Most intelligent.
Reading la Roche-Foucauld.

1375
01:04:59,930 --> 01:05:01,565
Yes, indeed, ma'am.

1376
01:05:01,631 --> 01:05:03,667
I think perhaps I'd
better warn the regent

1377
01:05:03,733 --> 01:05:05,811
that we shall be leaving soon
if your majesty will excuse me.

1378
01:05:05,835 --> 01:05:07,737
Mmm. Is that that evening dress
you were wearing?

1379
01:05:07,804 --> 01:05:10,840
Oh, yes, ma'am. You see,
I was trying to explain...

1380
01:05:10,907 --> 01:05:11,907
ohh...

1381
01:05:11,908 --> 01:05:13,477
Lottie, my jewelry box.

1382
01:05:17,614 --> 01:05:20,684
Just turn around,
my dear, will you?

1383
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:22,286
And lower yourself.

1384
01:05:26,323 --> 01:05:29,093
Yes, that is very possible.

1385
01:05:29,159 --> 01:05:31,028
I think we need something else.

1386
01:05:31,095 --> 01:05:32,396
But, ma'am...

1387
01:05:32,462 --> 01:05:34,298
just turn around again,
my dear, will you?

1388
01:05:34,364 --> 01:05:36,633
And lower yourself again.

1389
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:37,734
Good.

1390
01:05:37,801 --> 01:05:39,669
Oh, what's happening?

1391
01:05:39,736 --> 01:05:40,837
Is this a game?

1392
01:05:40,904 --> 01:05:42,639
Did you say something, my dear?

1393
01:05:42,706 --> 01:05:45,075
Ask ma'am if this is a game!

1394
01:05:45,142 --> 01:05:47,344
She wants to know,
is this a game, ma'am?

1395
01:05:47,411 --> 01:05:50,080
Uh, Lottie, my dear,
put your cape on her, would you?

1396
01:05:50,147 --> 01:05:52,516
Oh, what's happening?
Please tell me.

1397
01:05:52,582 --> 01:05:53,650
Better and better.

1398
01:05:53,717 --> 01:05:55,361
Lottie, my dear, would you
be very disappointed...

1399
01:05:55,385 --> 01:05:57,054
ho ho.
On the contrary, ma'am,

1400
01:05:57,121 --> 01:05:59,523
as you know,
it is my little trouble.

1401
01:05:59,589 --> 01:06:02,126
I always have been a little
nervous of long ceremonies.

1402
01:06:02,192 --> 01:06:03,460
Good.
That is settled, then.

1403
01:06:03,527 --> 01:06:06,196
Lend her your gloves
and arrange her veil on her.

1404
01:06:06,263 --> 01:06:08,398
Oh, what's happening?
Please tell me.

1405
01:06:08,465 --> 01:06:11,335
I am appointing you my lady-in-waiting
for the day, my dear,

1406
01:06:11,401 --> 01:06:13,803
and taking you to the Abbey.

1407
01:06:13,870 --> 01:06:16,073
Oh, ma'am, you can't.

1408
01:06:16,140 --> 01:06:18,442
I mean, what if someone
would recognize me?

1409
01:06:18,508 --> 01:06:19,308
I'd be arrested.

1410
01:06:19,309 --> 01:06:20,349
Arrest my lady-in-waiting?

1411
01:06:20,377 --> 01:06:22,046
My dear child,
such an absurdity.

1412
01:06:22,112 --> 01:06:24,781
But where will I sit,
and what will I do?

1413
01:06:24,848 --> 01:06:26,316
You just do what is obvious

1414
01:06:26,383 --> 01:06:29,053
and sit where
Mr. Northbrook tells you.

1415
01:06:29,119 --> 01:06:30,887
You still look rather bare.

1416
01:06:30,954 --> 01:06:32,556
I know.
You need an order.

1417
01:06:32,622 --> 01:06:34,958
Lottie, go and fetch the ambassador,
will you?

1418
01:06:35,025 --> 01:06:35,825
My dear...

1419
01:06:35,826 --> 01:06:37,062
Hello.

1420
01:06:37,127 --> 01:06:39,063
My dear, such fun,
how you will laugh.

1421
01:06:39,129 --> 01:06:40,997
We are taking miss Marina
to the Abbey.

1422
01:06:41,065 --> 01:06:42,566
Oh? Are we?

1423
01:06:42,632 --> 01:06:45,202
But I need an order
for her, my dear.

1424
01:06:45,269 --> 01:06:47,171
Ah, dear ambassador,

1425
01:06:47,237 --> 01:06:48,314
fetch me that nice mauve order,

1426
01:06:48,338 --> 01:06:49,706
the one the regent gave

1427
01:06:49,773 --> 01:06:51,575
to the foreign secretary
the other day.

1428
01:06:51,641 --> 01:06:52,909
My dear mother-in-law...

1429
01:06:52,976 --> 01:06:54,254
what is it you
are wearing, Lottie?

1430
01:06:54,278 --> 01:06:56,113
The purple pillow...

1431
01:06:56,180 --> 01:06:57,223
no. The mauve one is
much more fetching.

1432
01:06:57,247 --> 01:06:58,748
So slim and pretty,

1433
01:06:58,815 --> 01:07:00,950
we will now be most
comfortable in the carriage.

1434
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:02,186
Hand it to the regent.

1435
01:07:04,821 --> 01:07:05,922
You realize, I suppose,

1436
01:07:05,989 --> 01:07:07,491
that this order is only given

1437
01:07:07,557 --> 01:07:09,859
for a very special
personal service

1438
01:07:09,926 --> 01:07:10,894
to the head of the state?

1439
01:07:10,895 --> 01:07:11,995
Such hairsplitting.

1440
01:07:12,062 --> 01:07:13,697
No doubt she will
do you one one day.

1441
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:19,403
Take your cape off.

1442
01:07:22,139 --> 01:07:23,273
Kneel down.

1443
01:07:29,579 --> 01:07:33,883
I hereby invest you with
the royal Carpathian order

1444
01:07:33,950 --> 01:07:37,254
of perseverance.

1445
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:39,223
Second-class.

1446
01:07:39,289 --> 01:07:41,225
Queen dowager:
Come, my dears.

1447
01:07:42,659 --> 01:07:47,397
And I hereby return you this.

1448
01:07:47,464 --> 01:07:49,599
After all,
we're not parting quite yet,

1449
01:07:49,666 --> 01:07:52,169
are we, my darling grand Duke?

1450
01:08:03,046 --> 01:08:05,215
[Crowd cheering]

1451
01:08:18,995 --> 01:08:21,298
[Band plays]

1452
01:08:27,036 --> 01:08:28,905
Oh, it's a shame.

1453
01:08:28,972 --> 01:08:30,707
She's gonna hate us.
Oh, do be quiet.

1454
01:08:30,774 --> 01:08:32,585
Yes, fair Lily,
we can't spoil a lovely day like this

1455
01:08:32,609 --> 01:08:35,011
worrying about
that wretched girl.

1456
01:08:35,078 --> 01:08:37,113
I'm sure miss America
has missed the boat.

1457
01:08:37,181 --> 01:08:38,315
Nyah, nyah, nyah.

1458
01:08:38,382 --> 01:08:39,949
Oh, shut up.
Oh, cheer up, Fanny.

1459
01:08:40,016 --> 01:08:41,685
It's her own silly fault.

1460
01:08:41,751 --> 01:08:43,052
Well, it's a shame.

1461
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:44,654
Oh, well.
What could we do?

1462
01:08:57,100 --> 01:08:58,802
[Cheering]

1463
01:09:18,054 --> 01:09:20,924
Oh! Isn't this wonderful?

1464
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:22,192
Most impressive.

1465
01:09:22,259 --> 01:09:25,529
And the soldiers
facing the procession, too.

1466
01:09:25,595 --> 01:09:29,366
Such a change from the last coronation
I attended, the bessarabias.

1467
01:09:29,433 --> 01:09:31,668
Revolver shots going off
like kettle drums

1468
01:09:31,735 --> 01:09:34,037
and the sky black
with infernal machines.

1469
01:09:34,103 --> 01:09:36,172
Happily, no fatalities,

1470
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:37,441
except in the crowd,

1471
01:09:37,507 --> 01:09:40,444
but it all left
a very bad impression.

1472
01:09:46,115 --> 01:09:47,851
[Gasp]

1473
01:10:07,871 --> 01:10:10,974
This must be his grand Duke
who lives now.

1474
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:12,476
This is your moment,
Maisie, dear.

1475
01:10:12,542 --> 01:10:14,478
She won't get over this.
It's a shame.

1476
01:10:20,550 --> 01:10:22,252
It's her. I promise you,
it's her.

1477
01:10:22,319 --> 01:10:23,620
It's Elsie!

1478
01:10:23,687 --> 01:10:25,389
It's Elsie!

1479
01:10:25,455 --> 01:10:27,457
[Bugle blowing]

1480
01:10:27,524 --> 01:10:29,259
[Women screaming]

1481
01:10:30,927 --> 01:10:32,262
Ha ha ha ha!

1482
01:10:32,329 --> 01:10:34,498
Miss Springfield,
miss Springfield,

1483
01:10:34,564 --> 01:10:36,165
it's Elsie Marina,
miss Springfield,

1484
01:10:36,232 --> 01:10:39,002
with the regent
of Carpathia. Mmm!

1485
01:10:39,068 --> 01:10:41,037
Such a thing could not happen.

1486
01:10:41,104 --> 01:10:43,307
[Horn blowing]

1487
01:11:14,971 --> 01:11:17,407

[Bells peal]

1494
01:17:43,226 --> 01:17:46,329
Say, you haven't seen an old raincoat around,
have you?

1495
01:17:50,867 --> 01:17:52,335
Ok, forget it.

1496
01:17:55,438 --> 01:17:56,438
Oh.

1497
01:18:04,547 --> 01:18:06,649
Gosh.

1498
01:18:06,716 --> 01:18:08,351
Another one.

1499
01:18:39,783 --> 01:18:41,117
Hi there!

1500
01:18:42,318 --> 01:18:44,921
Good afternoon, miss Marina.

1501
01:18:44,988 --> 01:18:47,690
Oh, don't look so anxious.

1502
01:18:47,757 --> 01:18:49,392
I don't tell tales.

1503
01:18:49,458 --> 01:18:52,461
Oh. Oh, that is good of you.

1504
01:18:52,528 --> 01:18:54,230
I'm so very grateful.

1505
01:18:54,297 --> 01:18:55,808
Still,
that doesn't mean that I don't think

1506
01:18:55,832 --> 01:18:58,701
you're a very naughty boy.

1507
01:18:58,768 --> 01:18:59,903
Indeed?

1508
01:18:59,969 --> 01:19:02,071
To me and many of my countrymen,

1509
01:19:02,138 --> 01:19:05,374
it is my father who
is the naughty boy.

1510
01:19:05,441 --> 01:19:07,510
Yes, but you're only 16,

1511
01:19:07,576 --> 01:19:08,476
whereas he's...

1512
01:19:08,477 --> 01:19:09,879
well, he says 40,

1513
01:19:09,946 --> 01:19:12,615
but I'd make a rough guess at,
um...

1514
01:19:12,681 --> 01:19:14,183
45?

1515
01:19:14,250 --> 01:19:16,385
Shouldn't you wait
till you're grown up?

1516
01:19:16,452 --> 01:19:17,954
Miss Marina...

1517
01:19:18,021 --> 01:19:20,423
I can see that you are very kind

1518
01:19:20,489 --> 01:19:22,358
and a good person,

1519
01:19:22,425 --> 01:19:24,693
but in matters of this nature...

1520
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:25,795
Nicolas...

1521
01:19:25,862 --> 01:19:28,865
I wish to speak with you.

1522
01:19:28,932 --> 01:19:30,499
No, do not go, miss Marina.

1523
01:19:30,566 --> 01:19:32,368
This concerns you, too.

1524
01:19:32,435 --> 01:19:34,637
The telephone operator
has reported to Hoffman

1525
01:19:34,703 --> 01:19:37,240
that you've talked with
the German ambassador this morning.

1526
01:19:37,306 --> 01:19:37,806
That is true?

1527
01:19:37,807 --> 01:19:39,309
Yes.

1528
01:19:39,375 --> 01:19:41,210
After miss Marina
had obtained you the number.

1529
01:19:41,277 --> 01:19:43,079
She did not know
what the number was.

1530
01:19:43,146 --> 01:19:45,181
You passed a message,
didn't you?

1531
01:19:45,248 --> 01:19:46,649
Your operator will tell you...

1532
01:19:46,715 --> 01:19:47,715
she doesn't speak German.

1533
01:19:47,716 --> 01:19:49,318
I know.
I found that out.

1534
01:19:51,955 --> 01:19:54,090
Will you tell me
the message, Nicky?

1535
01:19:59,863 --> 01:20:04,533
Isn't it nice that it was such
a fine day for the coronation?

1536
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:06,302
You'll go to your room.

1537
01:20:06,369 --> 01:20:08,838
Colonel Hoffman will
visit you there later.

1538
01:20:08,905 --> 01:20:10,473
And, of course,
there's no question

1539
01:20:10,539 --> 01:20:12,641
of your going
to the ball tonight.

1540
01:20:12,708 --> 01:20:15,778
I prefer not to keep company
with traitors.

1541
01:20:15,845 --> 01:20:18,114
Miss Marina...

1542
01:20:18,181 --> 01:20:21,617
I say this with sincerity.

1543
01:20:21,684 --> 01:20:23,219
It has been a real pleasure.

1544
01:20:35,398 --> 01:20:38,534
What am I to do with such a boy?

1545
01:20:41,470 --> 01:20:44,273
If you were asking me
that question seriously,

1546
01:20:44,340 --> 01:20:47,243
oh, would I give you an answer,
but since you're not...

1547
01:20:47,310 --> 01:20:48,978
but I am asking you,
although, Herr Gott,

1548
01:20:49,045 --> 01:20:50,880
I know what the
answer is going to be.

1549
01:20:50,947 --> 01:20:54,517
Something about his not having
enough love in his life, I suppose.

1550
01:20:54,583 --> 01:20:56,085
Not such a bad guess.

1551
01:20:56,152 --> 01:20:58,621
[Speaking German]

1552
01:20:58,687 --> 01:21:00,789
Such sentimental idiocy.

1553
01:21:00,856 --> 01:21:03,092
Why do you always
swear in German?

1554
01:21:03,159 --> 01:21:07,363
Because the Germans
have the best oaths...

1555
01:21:07,430 --> 01:21:11,400
And the best machine guns.

1556
01:21:11,467 --> 01:21:13,336
Yes, I suppose...

1557
01:21:13,402 --> 01:21:15,304
Cross thunder weather yet again

1558
01:21:15,371 --> 01:21:17,540
wouldn't sound nearly so fierce,
would it?

1559
01:21:18,908 --> 01:21:20,143
Oh, well.

1560
01:21:20,209 --> 01:21:21,978
I guess there's
nothing left for me to do

1561
01:21:22,045 --> 01:21:24,347
but to take off all of my finery

1562
01:21:24,413 --> 01:21:26,482
and slip quietly
out of your life forever.

1563
01:21:26,549 --> 01:21:27,716
What?

1564
01:21:27,783 --> 01:21:30,153
I said, I guess
there's nothing left...

1565
01:21:30,219 --> 01:21:31,454
no, no, no.
Before that.

1566
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:33,422
You translated.
Do you speak German?

1567
01:21:33,489 --> 01:21:34,257
Sure.

1568
01:21:34,258 --> 01:21:35,658
Then you heard his message.

1569
01:21:35,724 --> 01:21:38,761
Oh, yes, but I'm not going
to tell you what it was,

1570
01:21:38,827 --> 01:21:41,030
so don't excite yourself
too much.

1571
01:21:41,097 --> 01:21:43,699
Ooh, don't you look cute
when you're fierce.

1572
01:21:43,766 --> 01:21:45,468
Miss Marina...

1573
01:21:45,534 --> 01:21:48,404
You are in possession of some very
dangerous information, and I must...

1574
01:21:48,471 --> 01:21:50,940
now, don't put the screws on me,
darling.

1575
01:21:51,007 --> 01:21:53,376
Oh, my dear, dear child,
if only you could...

1576
01:21:53,442 --> 01:21:56,045
oh, you can't wheedle me either.

1577
01:21:56,112 --> 01:21:58,181
[Shouting in German]

1578
01:21:58,247 --> 01:22:00,516
Well done.
That's the best yet.

1579
01:22:00,583 --> 01:22:02,285
[Giggling]

1580
01:22:02,351 --> 01:22:03,886
My darling, don't swear anymore.

1581
01:22:03,953 --> 01:22:05,354
You're gonna run out of oaths.

1582
01:22:05,421 --> 01:22:07,356
I'm not going to tell you,
and that's that,

1583
01:22:07,423 --> 01:22:10,626
but I will tell you I think
the treatment of your son just now

1584
01:22:10,693 --> 01:22:11,627
was plain bad policy.

1585
01:22:11,628 --> 01:22:13,430
Good policy, I suppose,

1586
01:22:13,496 --> 01:22:15,374
would be to kiss the little schweinhund
on both cheeks

1587
01:22:15,398 --> 01:22:17,233
and say, let bygones be bygones.

1588
01:22:17,300 --> 01:22:19,435
Dear child, come to the ball.

1589
01:22:19,502 --> 01:22:21,270
The words right out of my mouth.

1590
01:22:21,337 --> 01:22:23,257
Now, who is Nicky more likely
to tell his plot to,

1591
01:22:23,306 --> 01:22:24,607
that nasty old colonel Hoffman

1592
01:22:24,673 --> 01:22:26,709
giving him the
dickens in his room

1593
01:22:26,775 --> 01:22:29,378
or his dream prince
of a beautiful father

1594
01:22:29,445 --> 01:22:30,779
taking him to the ball?

1595
01:22:30,846 --> 01:22:31,923
Do not call me by these names.

1596
01:22:31,947 --> 01:22:33,016
It is grotesque.

1597
01:22:33,082 --> 01:22:34,217
Oh, darling,

1598
01:22:34,283 --> 01:22:36,385
I may call you by
other names one day,

1599
01:22:36,452 --> 01:22:37,886
but for now,
you'll have to forgive

1600
01:22:37,953 --> 01:22:39,422
the language of love.

1601
01:22:40,923 --> 01:22:43,092
I'm ready for my good-bye kiss.

1602
01:22:46,529 --> 01:22:47,563
Is that all I get?

1603
01:22:47,630 --> 01:22:49,132
The way I'm feeling
at the moment,

1604
01:22:49,198 --> 01:22:51,267
it is considered a bit too much.

1605
01:22:53,236 --> 01:22:55,238
Tell the king
to come and see me.

1606
01:22:55,304 --> 01:22:57,540
Hey, what about
my parting present?

1607
01:23:03,112 --> 01:23:05,514
No. Pin it on, please.

1608
01:23:17,293 --> 01:23:18,561
Now...

1609
01:23:18,627 --> 01:23:21,064
Say to me what you said
to me this morning.

1610
01:23:21,130 --> 01:23:23,199
If I do, you will
only laugh at me again

1611
01:23:23,266 --> 01:23:25,210
and say my epaulets are
scratching you or something,

1612
01:23:25,234 --> 01:23:28,003
and I shall be
disconcerted again.

1613
01:23:28,071 --> 01:23:29,705
Take the risk.

1614
01:23:30,873 --> 01:23:34,443
It has been wonderful
knowing you.

1615
01:23:34,510 --> 01:23:37,380
If only it could
have lasted longer.

1616
01:23:39,315 --> 01:23:41,016
Thank you, my darling.

1617
01:23:53,529 --> 01:23:55,164
His majesty.

1618
01:23:57,866 --> 01:24:00,269
Nicky...

1619
01:24:00,336 --> 01:24:02,771
Sit down, Nicky.

1620
01:24:02,838 --> 01:24:04,773
This German embassy affair

1621
01:24:04,840 --> 01:24:06,609
has made me most unhappy.

1622
01:24:06,675 --> 01:24:08,444
I have always known
that you and I

1623
01:24:08,511 --> 01:24:10,513
did not see eye-to-eye
on policy,

1624
01:24:10,579 --> 01:24:13,349
but that my own son
should conspire against me

1625
01:24:13,416 --> 01:24:16,352
has been a most bitter shock.

1626
01:24:16,419 --> 01:24:19,188
Ah, Nicky, Nicky,
I wonder if you realize

1627
01:24:19,255 --> 01:24:22,525
how easy it is to break
a father's heart.

1628
01:24:22,591 --> 01:24:25,661
If you mean your heart,
father, I don't.

1629
01:24:25,728 --> 01:24:29,665
Perhaps that is because I don't
wear my heart on my sleeve, Nicky.

1630
01:24:29,732 --> 01:24:33,369
Some people prefer to keep their
feelings bottled up, you know,

1631
01:24:33,436 --> 01:24:35,104
and I... maybe I am at fault...

1632
01:24:35,171 --> 01:24:36,839
[plucks strings]

1633
01:24:36,905 --> 01:24:40,476
Anyway, Nicky, I don't want to say
any more about it.

1634
01:24:40,543 --> 01:24:42,945
I have decided to let bygones
be bygones,

1635
01:24:43,011 --> 01:24:44,980
and after all,
in spite of everything,

1636
01:24:45,047 --> 01:24:46,615
you may come to the ball.

1637
01:24:46,682 --> 01:24:48,617
Thank you, father,
but I don't think I want to.

1638
01:24:48,684 --> 01:24:50,619
I think I would
rather go to bed.

1639
01:24:50,686 --> 01:24:52,621
Oh, but, sir,
you must go to the ball.

1640
01:24:52,688 --> 01:24:55,324
It's going to be
the most beautiful ball ever...

1641
01:24:55,391 --> 01:24:57,226
fabulous uniforms,
beautiful decorations...

1642
01:24:57,293 --> 01:24:59,128
no. I would've
liked to have gone,

1643
01:24:59,195 --> 01:25:01,864
but grandmother says she's not going
because she's tired,

1644
01:25:01,930 --> 01:25:03,332
and I won't know anyone.

1645
01:25:03,399 --> 01:25:05,334
And I won't have anyone
to dance with.

1646
01:25:05,401 --> 01:25:06,545
Invite someone to dance with.

1647
01:25:06,569 --> 01:25:07,712
Invite someone?
Yes, of course.

1648
01:25:07,736 --> 01:25:09,338
I can easily arrange these
things.

1649
01:25:09,405 --> 01:25:10,973
You mean anyone?
Yes, anyone!

1650
01:25:11,039 --> 01:25:13,576
Miss Marina,
will you accompany me

1651
01:25:13,642 --> 01:25:15,778
to the coronation ball tonight?

1652
01:25:17,780 --> 01:25:22,751
Oh, I shall be very happy to obey
your majesty's command.

1653
01:25:22,818 --> 01:25:23,618
That is good!

1654
01:25:23,619 --> 01:25:25,588
Then I shall come in person

1655
01:25:25,654 --> 01:25:27,523
to collect you at
your theater at 11:00?

1656
01:25:27,590 --> 01:25:29,225
Oh, that would be nice.

1657
01:25:29,292 --> 01:25:32,561
Say, uh, do you think your
grandmother would mind if...

1658
01:25:32,628 --> 01:25:35,431
No, she won't mind.
I'll bring them for you.

1659
01:25:35,498 --> 01:25:36,899
She'll just say, "such fun."

1660
01:25:36,965 --> 01:25:39,902
And I'll borrow one of her tiaras
for you, too.

1661
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:43,672
Well, if they can see me leave
the theater in a tiara,

1662
01:25:43,739 --> 01:25:47,543
they can darn well see me arrive
in an evening gown.

1663
01:25:47,610 --> 01:25:49,678
I think I shall find
you another order.

1664
01:25:49,745 --> 01:25:52,715
The one you are wearing
is not first-class.

1665
01:25:52,781 --> 01:25:56,685
Oh. No?
Well, mind, I wasn't going to say anything,

1666
01:25:56,752 --> 01:26:00,589
but, um, if you really think...

1667
01:26:09,998 --> 01:26:11,834
See you at the ball.

how many engagements

your sake tonight...

So kind.

1675
01:27:07,155 --> 01:27:11,026
You will come, then,
to the embassy at about 12:30?

1676
01:27:11,093 --> 01:27:12,828
I have arranged a little supper.

1677
01:27:12,895 --> 01:27:16,832
At your command,
I would come to the end of the earth.

fortunately not so far.

Ah, and here is
your escort, my dear.

highness will permit.

1681

Not at all.
I envy you, old boy.

1682
01:27:33,749 --> 01:27:35,718
Well?
I'm afraid I can't find them.

1683
01:27:35,784 --> 01:27:37,520
Northbrook,
you should not let them

1684
01:27:37,586 --> 01:27:38,854
out of your sight for a moment.

1685
01:27:38,921 --> 01:27:41,223

anything can happen.

1692

Well,
it seems reasonable enough to me.

were a reasonable man.

1694

Indeed? And I have been
looking for you.

1702
01:28:46,622 --> 01:28:48,023
Well, can you beat that?

1703
01:28:48,090 --> 01:28:50,225
Father, I feel sure
that you should like

1704
01:28:50,292 --> 01:28:53,095
to have a dance
with miss Marina.

1705
01:28:53,161 --> 01:28:54,397
I should be charmed.

Would you care for
a little refreshment?

1709
01:29:02,638 --> 01:29:04,106
Thank you so much.

1710
01:29:04,172 --> 01:29:05,774
What a sweet boy he is.

1711

My son?

1712
01:29:06,842 --> 01:29:08,110
Far too grown up.

1713
01:29:08,176 --> 01:29:10,112
I guess that's just due to, uh...

1714
01:29:10,178 --> 01:29:11,780
due to his upbringing.

1715
01:29:11,847 --> 01:29:14,249
Say, wouldn't it be a good thing

1716
01:29:14,316 --> 01:29:15,884
if you and him made it up?

1717
01:29:15,951 --> 01:29:18,787
I mean, for your country and for
European peace and all that.

1718
01:29:18,854 --> 01:29:20,823
These things are not
done so easily.

1719
01:29:20,889 --> 01:29:22,634
Oh, I don't know.
With a little give and take,

1720
01:29:22,658 --> 01:29:23,458
it wouldn't be so hard.

1721

As a matter of fact,

1722
01:29:24,893 --> 01:29:26,505
I just happen to know what
his conditions would be.

1723
01:29:26,529 --> 01:29:27,763
Conditions?

1724
01:29:27,830 --> 01:29:30,966
Yes. He wants a motorcycle,

1725
01:29:31,033 --> 01:29:36,672
and he wants to be allowed to
ride it anywhere in Carpathia.

1726
01:29:36,739 --> 01:29:39,508
Well, it seems
reasonable enough to me.

1727
01:29:39,575 --> 01:29:42,144
Let's see. What else
did he want?

1728
01:29:42,210 --> 01:29:44,780
Oh, yes, I remember.

1729
01:29:44,847 --> 01:29:46,449

and your range is
so charming as it is.

1740
01:30:06,902 --> 01:30:08,003
Do you reverse?

1741
01:30:08,070 --> 01:30:09,705
Just try me.

1742
01:30:40,002 --> 01:30:42,971
[Giggles]

1743
01:30:50,045 --> 01:30:51,980
It is time for Nicky to go home.

1744
01:30:52,047 --> 01:30:55,984
And it is time for me to say
good-bye to you, my dear.

1745
01:30:56,051 --> 01:30:57,051
Oh, is it?

1746
01:30:57,052 --> 01:30:58,453
I fear so, my dear.

1747
01:30:58,521 --> 01:31:01,824
Oh... Alas.

1748
01:31:02,858 --> 01:31:04,793
Um, what about my brooch?

1749
01:31:04,860 --> 01:31:07,429
Uh, it will be sent on to you.

1750
01:31:07,496 --> 01:31:08,631
Oh, no. Don't bother.

1751
01:31:08,697 --> 01:31:11,033
I could stop by sometime
and pick it up.

1752
01:31:11,099 --> 01:31:12,367
Yes, of course. By all means.

1753
01:31:12,434 --> 01:31:14,970
Northbrook?
Yes, sir?

1754
01:31:15,037 --> 01:31:17,372
You will conduct his
majesty back to the embassy

1755
01:31:17,439 --> 01:31:19,007
and take miss Marina to Brixton.

1756
01:31:19,074 --> 01:31:21,710
And now, my dear,
it really is good-bye.

1757
01:31:21,777 --> 01:31:24,179
I thank you for your
little services to us,

1758
01:31:24,246 --> 01:31:27,583
and I wish you much
happiness and success.

1759
01:31:29,317 --> 01:31:31,554
Oh, your grand ducal,

1760
01:31:31,620 --> 01:31:33,922
it's been a great, great...

1761
01:31:35,791 --> 01:31:39,094
Well... Good-bye.
Good-bye.

1762
01:31:45,100 --> 01:31:46,201
Good night, Nicky.

1763
01:31:46,268 --> 01:31:49,605
Northbrook, I will take
my carriage in 10 minutes.

1764
01:32:04,419 --> 01:32:09,057
They went for a ride on a bus?

1765
01:32:09,124 --> 01:32:10,292
A public bus?

1766
01:32:10,358 --> 01:32:12,527
On number 57.

1767
01:32:13,662 --> 01:32:15,163
This may mean
a scandal, Northbrook.

1768
01:32:15,230 --> 01:32:16,732
Yes, sir.

1769
01:32:16,799 --> 01:32:20,302
And you followed this bus in the
carriage as far as Victoria station?

1770
01:32:20,368 --> 01:32:21,970
Yes, sir.
I then followed them on foot

1771
01:32:22,037 --> 01:32:23,839
as they walked from
there to the embassy.

1772
01:32:23,906 --> 01:32:26,074
They walked... you mean
she's here in the building?

1773
01:32:26,141 --> 01:32:28,677
Yes, sir. She is with the king
in the stewards' room.

1774
01:32:28,744 --> 01:32:30,188
What are they doing
in the stewards' room?

1775
01:32:30,212 --> 01:32:32,314
She is teaching the king
an American dance

1776
01:32:32,380 --> 01:32:34,016
called a fox trot.

1777
01:32:34,082 --> 01:32:36,151
Your valet Franz
is playing for them.

1778
01:32:36,218 --> 01:32:41,089
With one or two others of the household.
In ragtime.

1779
01:32:41,156 --> 01:32:42,390
[Speaking German]

1780
01:32:42,457 --> 01:32:43,759
Exactly, sir.

1781
01:32:46,795 --> 01:32:49,064
Lady Sunningdale is late.

1782
01:32:49,131 --> 01:32:51,433
Only a few minutes, sir.

1783
01:32:51,499 --> 01:32:53,235
Her unpunctuality used to be

1784
01:32:53,301 --> 01:32:55,738
one of her most irritating
characteristics.

1785
01:32:55,804 --> 01:33:01,076
I had hoped she might have grown
out of it by now.

1786
01:33:01,143 --> 01:33:04,947
She has had
the, after all... Time.

1787
01:33:06,014 --> 01:33:06,948
Hello.

1788
01:33:06,949 --> 01:33:07,815
Hello.

1789
01:33:07,816 --> 01:33:09,484
Oh, supper!
How lovely.

1790
01:33:09,551 --> 01:33:11,119
How thoughtful of you, darling.

1791
01:33:11,186 --> 01:33:13,588
I'll just run down and
say good night to Nicky.

1792
01:33:13,656 --> 01:33:16,859
I'll be right back
in just a minute.

1793
01:33:25,467 --> 01:33:26,835
Come, come, sir.

1794
01:33:26,902 --> 01:33:28,804
All that is needed is
a little firmness.

1795
01:33:28,871 --> 01:33:29,972
You should say straight out

1796
01:33:30,038 --> 01:33:31,439
that the supper is not for her

1797
01:33:31,506 --> 01:33:33,051
and that you are
expecting another guest.

1798
01:33:33,075 --> 01:33:34,943
That is your
considered suggestion

1799
01:33:35,010 --> 01:33:37,179
for surmounting this
crisis, Northbrook?

1800
01:33:37,245 --> 01:33:38,346
Yes, sir, it is.

1801
01:33:38,413 --> 01:33:41,650
Then I can only say that
I now fully understand

1802
01:33:41,717 --> 01:33:44,552
why the foreign office
always makes such a mess

1803
01:33:44,619 --> 01:33:47,422
of its relations
with the state department.

1804
01:33:47,489 --> 01:33:50,458
Northbrook, we are not here dealing
with a civilized adult,

1805
01:33:50,525 --> 01:33:51,927
but with an unruly child.

1806
01:33:51,994 --> 01:33:56,631
Do you think I am anxious
to have supper for 3?

1807
01:33:57,365 --> 01:33:58,801
I'm sorry, sir.

1808
01:33:58,867 --> 01:34:01,804
I had not, I agree,
considered that aspect.

1809
01:34:01,870 --> 01:34:04,472
The best policy, then,
would appear for me to...

1810
01:34:04,539 --> 01:34:06,775
Intercept lady Sunningdale
on arrival

1811
01:34:06,842 --> 01:34:09,812
and escort her to the little
music roomdownstairs.

1812
01:34:09,878 --> 01:34:12,547
There I can arrange to
have another table made.

1813
01:34:12,614 --> 01:34:13,849
2 suppers I am to eat?

1814
01:34:13,916 --> 01:34:15,617
I'm afraid I see no alternative.

1815
01:34:15,684 --> 01:34:17,452
But how am I to leave this one?

1816
01:34:17,519 --> 01:34:20,022
That is the crux, Northbrook.

1817
01:34:20,088 --> 01:34:22,691
A few minutes after
lady Sunningdale arrives,

1818
01:34:22,758 --> 01:34:24,492
I shall come up here
and announce

1819
01:34:24,559 --> 01:34:26,729
that the ambassador
urgently requires your presence

1820
01:34:26,795 --> 01:34:28,196
in the chancellery

1821
01:34:28,263 --> 01:34:30,365
and that your business
will last for at least an hour.

1822
01:34:30,432 --> 01:34:32,567
You will then say good-bye
to miss Marina

1823
01:34:32,634 --> 01:34:34,402
for positively the last time...

1824
01:34:34,469 --> 01:34:35,437
oh, I shall be here, sir.

1825
01:34:35,438 --> 01:34:36,872
No harm will come to you...

1826
01:34:36,939 --> 01:34:39,207
and leave miss Marina for me
to escort back to Brixton.

1827
01:34:39,274 --> 01:34:40,843
At least an hour is hopeless.

1828
01:34:40,909 --> 01:34:42,144
You had better say all night.

1829
01:34:42,210 --> 01:34:43,678
Only so will your plan

1830
01:34:43,746 --> 01:34:45,680
have the faintest
chance of success.

1831
01:34:46,715 --> 01:34:47,816
Well, here I am.

1832
01:34:47,883 --> 01:34:49,684
You may leave us, Northbrook.

1833
01:34:49,752 --> 01:34:51,186
Very well, sir.

1834
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:03,065
Say, he doesn't do that half
as bad as me, does he?

1835
01:35:03,131 --> 01:35:04,131
Vodka?

1836
01:35:04,132 --> 01:35:05,132
Thank you.

1837
01:35:09,071 --> 01:35:10,605
Oh, that's too much.

1838
01:35:10,672 --> 01:35:14,409
Oh, you can take that, surely.

1839
01:35:14,476 --> 01:35:17,412
Oh,
too fast. I wanted to make you a toast.

1840
01:35:17,479 --> 01:35:19,714
Well, here, you'll have to
have some more.

1841
01:35:19,782 --> 01:35:21,249
No... not so much, please.

1842
01:35:21,316 --> 01:35:24,086
You don't want to spoil
my illusions of you, do you?

1843
01:35:24,152 --> 01:35:26,088
What are your illusions of me?

1844
01:35:26,154 --> 01:35:29,624
Well, your capacity for vodka's
certainly one of them.

1845
01:35:29,691 --> 01:35:34,797
Here's to... More love
in everybody's life.

1846
01:35:34,863 --> 01:35:35,998
Cheers.

1847
01:35:37,866 --> 01:35:41,736
Well, I have
a little document here.

1848
01:35:41,804 --> 01:35:43,071
Shall I read it?

1849
01:35:46,975 --> 01:35:49,044
"Manifesto to
my faithful subjects.

1850
01:35:49,111 --> 01:35:50,913
"I, Nicolas viii, king,

1851
01:35:50,979 --> 01:35:53,581
"do hereby renounce and reject
thoroughly the overtures

1852
01:35:53,648 --> 01:35:55,851
"lately made to me
by a certain person

1853
01:35:55,918 --> 01:35:59,621
"that I assume the powers of government
before the appointed time,

1854
01:35:59,687 --> 01:36:02,891
"and I do hereby solemnly adjure
all citizens of the realm

1855
01:36:02,958 --> 01:36:05,127
"to unite loyally
and wholeheartedly

1856
01:36:05,193 --> 01:36:07,595
"under the regency of my father,
the grand Duke Charles,

1857
01:36:07,662 --> 01:36:09,597
"for the settled peace
of the kingdom.

1858
01:36:09,664 --> 01:36:11,166
Signed, Nicolas."

1859
01:36:13,902 --> 01:36:16,071
But it isn't signed
"Nicolas" at all.

1860
01:36:16,138 --> 01:36:17,772
Of course not, darling.

1861
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:21,844
You know, you have those little
conditions to agree to first.

1862
01:36:21,910 --> 01:36:24,980
Give and take, darling.
Give and take.

1863
01:36:25,047 --> 01:36:26,481
Ah, that's right.

1864
01:36:26,548 --> 01:36:29,651
That'll help you see it
in the best possible light.

1865
01:36:29,717 --> 01:36:32,154
Do you not see,
you pretty little dummkopf,

1866
01:36:32,220 --> 01:36:35,490
that a general election will
put the kaiser's party in power

1867
01:36:35,557 --> 01:36:38,626
and there will be a war
in Europe in 6 months?

1868
01:36:38,693 --> 01:36:41,964
Well,
I don't see how you can be so sure.

1869
01:36:42,030 --> 01:36:43,966
I mean, well, what
if your party wins?

1870
01:36:44,032 --> 01:36:45,968
That's a funny thing
about general elections.

1871
01:36:46,034 --> 01:36:47,602
You never know
who's going to win.

1872
01:36:47,669 --> 01:36:51,974
"The overtures lately made to
me by a certain person..."

1873
01:36:52,040 --> 01:36:53,976
Of course, you do not realize

1874
01:36:54,042 --> 01:36:56,478
what it is you are
making the boy sign.

1875
01:36:56,544 --> 01:36:58,947
Yes, darling.
A manifesto.

1876
01:36:59,014 --> 01:37:02,450
A confession.
An abject confession by my son

1877
01:37:02,517 --> 01:37:05,120
that the kaiser's party
were plotting with him

1878
01:37:05,187 --> 01:37:07,655
to overthrow the constitution
and destroy me.

1879
01:37:07,722 --> 01:37:08,590
Ausgezeichnet!

1880
01:37:08,591 --> 01:37:09,825
Another vodka.

1881
01:37:09,892 --> 01:37:11,326
Ah, no, thank you.
I've had enough.

1882
01:37:11,393 --> 01:37:12,293
A little one.

1883
01:37:12,294 --> 01:37:14,429
Ah, hmm.

1884
01:37:14,496 --> 01:37:15,496
Something to eat?

1885
01:37:15,530 --> 01:37:18,867
Uh, no, thank you.
I'm not hungry.

1886
01:37:18,934 --> 01:37:21,536
Of course, the timing of events

1887
01:37:21,603 --> 01:37:23,671
will have to be most
carefully considered.

1888
01:37:23,738 --> 01:37:27,876
I hold the initiative now.
I must not lose it.

1889
01:37:27,943 --> 01:37:31,213
Well, I don't see,
with your fine brain

1890
01:37:31,279 --> 01:37:33,882
and your wonderful grasp
of the situation,

1891
01:37:33,949 --> 01:37:36,952
how you could ever lose
anything so little

1892
01:37:37,019 --> 01:37:39,287
as an initiative.

1893
01:37:50,198 --> 01:37:52,968
Wouldn't you be more comfortable
with your feet up?

1894
01:37:53,035 --> 01:37:55,170
No, thank you.

1895
01:38:00,575 --> 01:38:02,344
Vodka?

1896
01:38:02,410 --> 01:38:04,212
No, thank you.

1897
01:38:08,650 --> 01:38:09,384
Mein gott! I have it!

1898
01:38:09,385 --> 01:38:10,151
What?

1899
01:38:10,152 --> 01:38:11,419
I will give this manifesto

1900
01:38:11,486 --> 01:38:13,956
to the press of
the entire world.

1901
01:38:14,022 --> 01:38:15,557
That will proclaim
wolffstein's guilt

1902
01:38:15,623 --> 01:38:17,759
and explain why I've
had to put him in jail.

1903
01:38:17,825 --> 01:38:20,528
Also, it will answer those
stupid American protests...

1904
01:38:20,595 --> 01:38:23,098
I mean, it will satisfy
Democratic opinion.

1905
01:38:23,165 --> 01:38:24,366
Well, that's wonderful.

1906
01:38:24,432 --> 01:38:26,668
But here lies the
real key of the plan.

1907
01:38:26,734 --> 01:38:28,303
I will be most magnanimous.

1908
01:38:28,370 --> 01:38:31,173
Having established the guilt of
Wolffstein to the entire world,

1909
01:38:31,239 --> 01:38:33,108
I will then release him.

When you see her,
say good-bye to her for me

2072

and give her this
small parting gift.

01:48:07,381 --> 01:48:10,017
What? Oh, good morning,
miss Marina.

2087
01:48:10,084 --> 01:48:11,085
Good morning.

2088
01:48:11,152 --> 01:48:12,720
Yes, I am.

2089
01:48:12,787 --> 01:48:15,590
That's a sport you
should leave to me.

2090
01:48:19,426 --> 01:48:22,530
It was a lovely sunrise
this morning, wasn't it?

2091
01:48:22,597 --> 01:48:24,599
I doubt if I paid it
quite the same attention

2092
01:48:24,666 --> 01:48:26,400
as you obviously have.

2093
01:48:26,467 --> 01:48:28,135
I do hope you
haven't taken cold.

2094
01:48:28,202 --> 01:48:30,204
Were you out there long?

2095
01:48:30,271 --> 01:48:31,973
Almost all night.

2096
01:48:32,039 --> 01:48:33,841
I didn't want to
go back to Brixton.

2097
01:48:33,908 --> 01:48:35,442
I wanted to see them off.

2098
01:48:35,509 --> 01:48:39,413
You weren't thinking of going to the station,
miss Marina.

2099
01:48:39,480 --> 01:48:41,248
No.

2100
01:48:41,315 --> 01:48:42,416
I see.

2101
01:48:42,483 --> 01:48:44,085
I have to present these to you

2102
01:48:44,151 --> 01:48:45,452
with the king's compliments

2103
01:48:45,519 --> 01:48:46,988
and his thanks for last night,

2104
01:48:47,054 --> 01:48:48,694
which he claims was the
pleasantest evening

2105
01:48:48,756 --> 01:48:52,727
he has ever spent in his life.

2106
01:48:54,596 --> 01:48:59,533
Oh, how sweet.
He signed it, too.

2107
01:48:59,601 --> 01:49:01,869
Aah! Ha ha!

2108
01:49:01,936 --> 01:49:04,238
The royal Carpathian arms.

2109
01:49:04,305 --> 01:49:06,608
Well, wouldn't you know it?

2110
01:49:13,848 --> 01:49:15,416
As I am plainly de trop,

2111
01:49:15,482 --> 01:49:18,485
I shall await your grand ducal
highness in the hall.

2112
01:49:18,552 --> 01:49:20,154
I won't say good-bye,
miss Marina.

2113
01:49:20,221 --> 01:49:21,732
I understand we shall be seeing
a lot of each other

2114
01:49:21,756 --> 01:49:23,057
during the next few days,

2115
01:49:23,124 --> 01:49:24,467
what with special passports
and other things.

2116
01:49:24,491 --> 01:49:26,027
Special passports?

2117
01:49:26,093 --> 01:49:27,962
Northbrook, that was intended
to be a surprise.

2118
01:49:28,029 --> 01:49:29,764
I'm so sorry,
your grand ducal highness.

2119
01:49:29,831 --> 01:49:33,200
I wouldn't have spoilt it
for the world.

2120
01:49:36,503 --> 01:49:37,705
[Door closes]

2121
01:49:39,206 --> 01:49:40,742
Good morning.

2122
01:49:41,609 --> 01:49:43,778
Good morning.

2123
01:49:53,420 --> 01:49:54,656
[Chuckles]

2124
01:49:54,722 --> 01:49:56,157
My dear.

2125
01:49:56,223 --> 01:49:59,360
I have been making such
a spectacle of myself today,

2126
01:49:59,426 --> 01:50:01,128
behaving like a schoolboy,

2127
01:50:01,195 --> 01:50:03,097
and what is so surprising,
loving it, you know?

2128
01:50:03,164 --> 01:50:04,598
Oh, dear.

2129
01:50:04,666 --> 01:50:07,334
This morning it's up to me
to be the grown-up one,

2130
01:50:07,401 --> 01:50:08,169
isn't it?

2131
01:50:08,170 --> 01:50:10,172
Oh, grown up, eh?

2132
01:50:10,237 --> 01:50:13,941
It's hard for you to remember,
I suppose, sometimes.

2133
01:50:14,008 --> 01:50:17,144
You're really quite
an important man, aren't you?

2134
01:50:17,211 --> 01:50:18,946
Oh...

2135
01:50:19,013 --> 01:50:22,950
I rule a small country
which is not my own.

2136
01:50:23,017 --> 01:50:26,453
For which I have some loyalty,
but no feeling.

2137
01:50:26,520 --> 01:50:29,256
I rule it as well as I can.

2138
01:50:29,323 --> 01:50:33,360
No better and no worse than
any other man in my place.

2139
01:50:33,427 --> 01:50:35,462
Is that so important?

2140
01:50:35,529 --> 01:50:36,597
They say it is.

2141
01:50:36,664 --> 01:50:38,866
They? Why are they?

2142
01:50:40,634 --> 01:50:42,103
People.

2143
01:50:43,037 --> 01:50:45,639
Last night one man said,

2144
01:50:45,707 --> 01:50:47,517
"you know, you wouldn't
think it to look at him,

2145
01:50:47,541 --> 01:50:50,845
but there goes the best political
brain in Europe."

2146
01:50:50,912 --> 01:50:52,222
"Would not think it
to look at..."

2147
01:50:52,246 --> 01:50:54,648
but, my darling,
in 18 months' time,

2148
01:50:54,716 --> 01:50:56,217
I shall surrender
my power to Nicky.

2149
01:50:56,283 --> 01:50:58,219
I shall then be a free citizen.

2150
01:50:58,285 --> 01:51:03,657
In 18 months' time, I'm free
of my contract with George Edwards.

2151
01:51:03,725 --> 01:51:06,027
So there we are, aren't we?

2152
01:51:06,093 --> 01:51:07,762
18...

2153
01:51:08,595 --> 01:51:11,032
My dear child.

2154
01:51:12,566 --> 01:51:16,070
You do not realize
what can happen in this world

2155
01:51:16,137 --> 01:51:18,806
in 18 months.

2156
01:51:18,873 --> 01:51:21,442
Yes, I think I do.

2157
01:51:21,508 --> 01:51:24,746
I really think I do.

2158
01:51:27,782 --> 01:51:30,217
This is good-bye, then.

2159
01:51:30,284 --> 01:51:31,986
Au revoir.

2160
01:51:33,420 --> 01:51:35,456
Au revoir, of course.

2161
01:51:39,126 --> 01:51:42,830
Could I have my parting present now,
please?

2162
01:51:56,577 --> 01:51:58,512
But it is real, you know?

2163
01:51:58,579 --> 01:52:00,815
Of course it is, my darling.

2164
01:52:00,882 --> 01:52:05,519
I just want to remember
which one it is.

2165
01:52:05,586 --> 01:52:08,322
Pin it on for me, please.

2166
01:52:16,630 --> 01:52:18,933
Poor darling, you feel terr...

2167
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,602
terribly disconcerted?

2168
01:52:21,668 --> 01:52:24,571
Yes...

2169
01:52:24,638 --> 01:52:25,973
I do.

2170
01:52:27,341 --> 01:52:30,744
Childishness
isn't all fun, is it?

2171
01:52:33,614 --> 01:52:35,049
No.

2172
01:52:39,420 --> 01:52:41,755
[Door opens]

2173
01:52:41,823 --> 01:52:43,257
Good morning, miss Marina.

2174
01:52:43,324 --> 01:52:45,426
How good of you
to be here so early,

2175
01:52:45,492 --> 01:52:47,161
is it not, Charles?
Yes, yes, indeed.

2176
01:52:47,228 --> 01:52:49,897
My dear, such a night.
Not a wink of sleep.

2177
01:52:49,964 --> 01:52:53,267
Some dreadful drunkard fiddling in
the corridor for hours and hours.

2178
01:52:53,334 --> 01:52:55,136
And the night before, too,
only not so long.

2179
01:52:55,202 --> 01:52:56,971
I did not dare
go out and stop him

2180
01:52:57,038 --> 01:52:59,473
in case it was an anarchist
or a republican or something.

2181
01:52:59,540 --> 01:53:01,275
One never knows nowadays.

2182
01:53:01,342 --> 01:53:02,910
So disturbing.

2183
01:53:02,977 --> 01:53:06,513
My dear, why do you
always wear white?

2184
01:53:06,580 --> 01:53:09,716
I suppose because
I think it suits me, ma'am.

2185
01:53:09,783 --> 01:53:11,485
Yes. But not
all the time, my dear.

2186
01:53:11,552 --> 01:53:14,788
You are imitating the divine
Sarah Bernhardt, no doubt.

2187
01:53:14,856 --> 01:53:16,323
But even she, I am told,

2188
01:53:16,390 --> 01:53:19,160
changes her dress occasionally.

2189
01:53:19,226 --> 01:53:20,226
Mmm...

2190
01:53:20,227 --> 01:53:21,295
Maud.

2191
01:53:21,362 --> 01:53:23,064
Yes, ma'am, I have it here.

2192
01:53:23,130 --> 01:53:25,732
Here is a little brooch for you

2193
01:53:25,799 --> 01:53:28,836
with the Carpathian arms on it.

2194
01:53:28,903 --> 01:53:30,604
Thank you, ma'am.
How kind of you.

2195
01:53:30,671 --> 01:53:33,274
And here is a photograph for you,
too.

2196
01:53:33,340 --> 01:53:34,808
Let me see, now.

2197
01:53:34,876 --> 01:53:37,544
Yes, I have signed it.

2198
01:53:37,611 --> 01:53:39,613
Thank you, ma'am.

2199
01:53:39,680 --> 01:53:42,884
You may kiss me, my dear.

2200
01:53:47,721 --> 01:53:49,356
Hmm.

2201
01:53:49,423 --> 01:53:52,359
Mr. Northbrook,
you will come to the station with us?

2202
01:53:52,426 --> 01:53:54,896
Of course, ma'am.
The king has already left for the station

2203
01:53:54,962 --> 01:53:56,663
with the ambassador.

2204
01:53:56,730 --> 01:53:58,942
And there is a motor to take
miss Marina where she wishes?

2205
01:53:58,966 --> 01:54:01,668
Of course, sir.

2206
01:54:01,735 --> 01:54:06,307
Yes. I do think just a little
variety in the costume, my dear.

2207
01:54:06,373 --> 01:54:08,575
Nothing exaggerated, of course.

2208
01:54:08,642 --> 01:54:09,810
Simply from time to time,

2209
01:54:09,877 --> 01:54:12,213
an ordinary little day dress.

2210
01:54:12,279 --> 01:54:14,681
Such fun it has been.
Good-bye.

2211
01:54:14,748 --> 01:54:17,051
Good-bye, ma'am.

2212
01:54:31,732 --> 01:54:34,868
Send me a photograph.

2213
01:54:37,771 --> 01:54:40,574
Address it to the theater.

2214
01:54:46,713 --> 01:54:48,482
Sign it.

2215
01:54:52,653 --> 01:54:54,621
Elsie: Au revoir.

2216
01:54:57,691 --> 01:55:00,027
Charles: Au revoir.
