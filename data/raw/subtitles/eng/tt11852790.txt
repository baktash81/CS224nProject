We're fixing to put

00:01:37,698 --> 00:01:42,201
We're gonna see
out of you three, which one
truly is the master distiller.

33
00:01:42,203 --> 00:01:45,104
Now, what you get with that,
your bragging rights.

34
00:01:45,106 --> 00:01:48,907
But beyond that, you get
a limited run of your liquor
at a major distillery.

35
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:50,309
Pretty big deal.

36
00:01:50,311 --> 00:01:55,914
This competition's
all about tiny bubbles.
Carbonated liquor.

37
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:59,651
You're going to make us
a high proof,
great-tasting liquor

38
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:03,522
That then you're going
to temper it down
and carbonate it.

39
00:02:03,524 --> 00:02:05,424
Carbonated liquor in a can.

40
00:02:05,426 --> 00:02:07,759
It is the biggest trend going
right now.

41
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:10,162
Myself, I have one
in a can on the shelf.

42
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:11,997
But it is not easy.

43
00:02:12,032 --> 00:02:17,202
You need to be very precise
with your ph level and perfect
with your proofing.

44
00:02:18,606 --> 00:02:21,807
Tickle! Roll that beautiful
"history of" footage.

45
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:27,045
I think we'd all agree
that a little fizz and sparkle

<i>Make a drink</i>
<i>feel like a celebration.</i>

Now, I don't know what
he was trying to accomplish,
but here we are.

51
00:02:47,635 --> 00:02:51,403
Until then, liquor
had always been
drank straight.

52
00:02:51,405 --> 00:02:54,840
<i>But when people started mixi</i>
<i>carbonated water</i>
<i>with their liquor,</i>

53
00:02:54,942 --> 00:02:59,545
<i>It very quickly became</i>
<i>everybody's favorite way</i>
<i>to drink it.</i>

54
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:03,515
Hard seltzer
is once again the favorite
of the liquor world.

55
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:09,354
<i>Hard seltzer abv</i>
<i>ranges from 4% to 6%,</i>

Ahh. Effervescent.

57
00:03:14,962 --> 00:03:18,664
[digger] all right, guys.
What we want
is your best base liquor

58
00:03:18,732 --> 00:03:20,098
For your carbonated beverage.

59
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,801
That's where we're gonna
base our decision
on your first run.

60
00:03:22,803 --> 00:03:25,103
Come with me,
we're gonna go
build some mash.

61
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:38,817
All right, guys.
Time to build your mash.

62
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:40,686
Stuff you've never
been so proud of
in your life.

63
00:03:40,688 --> 00:03:44,790
You got one hour.
Your time starts now.
Good luck, guys.

64
00:03:44,792 --> 00:03:46,358

going down. [laughing]

65
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,827

-[chip] it's a good start.

[lauren laughing]

67
00:03:58,706 --> 00:04:01,406
-Oh, *bleep*, okay.
-How you feeling
down there, ryan?

68
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:04,209
I'm worried about
this direct flame.
Never done it.

69
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:06,044
-And outside.
-Yeah.

70
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:07,312
Gonna be interesting.

71

73
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,120

not intentionally stumble

74
00:04:15,122 --> 00:04:16,321
Into something
that you just love so much.

75
00:04:16,323 --> 00:04:17,356
What I like about distilling?

76
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:18,924

78
00:04:21,395 --> 00:04:24,029
It's science,
it's art, it's tasty.

79
00:04:24,031 --> 00:04:27,132
<i>At work, we have</i>
<i>a 600 liter hybrid still.</i>
<i>It's a beast.</i>

80
00:04:28,736 --> 00:04:31,236
So you can tell
it gets kind of like,
soupy and thick.

81
00:04:31,338 --> 00:04:33,939
So what we're gonna do
is add rye, make it thicker.

82
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:38,810
My experience with bubbles
is we do rtds, ready to drink
cocktails in cans.

83
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:41,113
<i>Our cola canned cocktails</i>
<i>are lightning.</i>

what you're doing here.

87
00:04:52,826 --> 00:04:55,127
-I'm making
a standard empire rye.
-Mmm-hmm.

88

-You're all grain,
no extra sugars?
-Nope, nothing.

91
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:06,705
Well, in your end product,
what are you looking at
for your abv?

92
00:05:06,707 --> 00:05:09,041
-I'm trying to hit
between 5% and 8%.
-All right.

93
00:05:09,043 --> 00:05:10,642
We look forward
to seeing how
you gonna carbonate it.

94
00:05:10,711 --> 00:05:11,743
I can't wait for you
to taste it.

95
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:12,711
All right, good luck.

96
00:05:12,713 --> 00:05:14,046

-[lauren] yeah, I am.

99
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:19,818
[chip] okay.

100
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,354

a whole lot of fire

106

Have not experimented
with catnip, but that
is next on my list.

107
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:46,345
I've had about a year or two
of experience working
with tiny bubbles.

108
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:48,146
<i>It's definitely</i>
<i>trial and error.</i>

109
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:49,614
<i>There's a lot of little thin</i>

110
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:51,750
That you have to be
conscious of when working
with bubbles.

111
00:05:51,819 --> 00:05:55,687
<i>And you know, people</i>
<i>tend to underestimate me</i>
<i>most of the time,</i>

112
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:58,323
<i>Because it is such</i>
<i>a male-dominated industry.</i>

113
00:05:58,325 --> 00:06:01,326
<i>But I'm pretty confident</i>
<i>in the work that I do.</i>

114
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:05,230
[digger] lauren, tell me
what your plan is here.

115
00:06:05,232 --> 00:06:07,432
Liquor with a little bit
of corn, little bit
of malted barley,

116
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:09,501
And then
I'm using a little bit
of turbinado sugar,

117
00:06:09,503 --> 00:06:11,503
Which is just
raw, unrefined sugar.

118
00:06:11,505 --> 00:06:13,939
Think that turbinado's
gonna work out well for you?

119
00:06:13,941 --> 00:06:16,408
I hope so.

120
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:19,811
This a recipe
you've used before, or is this
an experiment at this point?

121
00:06:19,813 --> 00:06:21,213
No, this is a little bit
of an experiment, yeah.

122
00:06:21,215 --> 00:06:23,048
-Kind of bold.
-That's why I'm here, though.

123
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:25,317
-You know, try something out.
-You need anything,
holler at me.

124
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:26,618
-I will.
-Good luck.

125
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,220
You're just
cool as a cucumber

126
00:06:28,222 --> 00:06:31,123

<i>just had, uh, the idea</i>
<i>to start making liquor.</i>

131
00:06:42,403 --> 00:06:45,003
We started running in 2002.

132
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:49,141
My brother passed away in 2019
at 35, and it destroyed me.

133
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,810
<i>I quit running</i>
<i>for about a year.</i>

134
00:06:51,812 --> 00:06:53,945
And, uh... [clears throat]

135
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:56,748
<i>I decided</i>
<i>he wouldn't want me</i>
<i>to quit running.</i>

136
00:06:56,817 --> 00:06:58,517
<i>So I went full blast.</i>

137
00:06:58,519 --> 00:06:59,751
And that led
to my still business.

138
00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:03,121
<i>13 stills. All family owned</i>
<i>and operated.</i>

139
00:07:03,123 --> 00:07:05,290
And this year alone,
we're gonna have

140
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:07,626
About 200 stills go out
of this shop.

141
00:07:07,628 --> 00:07:11,263
I sell a lotta liquor.
People come from miles around
to get my bourbon.

142
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:13,732
<i>I sell the hell out of it.</i>
<i>It's my life.</i>

143
00:07:14,501 --> 00:07:16,101
I know I'm gonna
produce good liquor,

144
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:18,804
But I'm really worried
about going down there
and carbonating my drink.

145
00:07:18,806 --> 00:07:20,806
I've only done carbonation
a couple times.

146
00:07:20,808 --> 00:07:22,507
<i>And it was with dry ice.</i>

147
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:25,043
I just take me a jug of liquor
and I crack the lid

148
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:26,445
And throw a piece
of dry ice in there.

149
00:07:26,447 --> 00:07:30,348
My recipe comes from
my little brother, tracy.

150
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,750
It's me and his recipe
of corn and rye

151
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:33,351
That we worked on
for about 15 years.

152
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:37,122
Hello, digger.
How you doing,
buddy?

153
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:38,723
I'm all right, how about you?

154
00:07:38,725 --> 00:07:41,426
Uh, pretty good. A little busy
trying to get some sugar
in here,

155
00:07:41,428 --> 00:07:42,961
And, uh, get mashed in.

156
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:44,529
A little rye, little corn.

157
00:07:44,531 --> 00:07:45,831
That's, uh, my specialty.

158
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:48,800
-What's your abv
for your final drink?
-I have no idea.

159
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:51,303
I'm not really good
with abv on the fly.

160
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:53,972
I don't care if it's
80 proof or 90 proof.

161
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:55,841
I just want a really good,
smooth jar of liquor.

162
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:58,109
You realize
you're carbonating
a can, don't you?

163
00:07:58,111 --> 00:08:00,745
-Yes, sir.
-See, that's what you gotta
be concerned with.

164
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:04,316
If you go in there
with 80 proof trying to get it
to carbonate,

165
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:05,817
You're dead in the water, bro.

166
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:09,855
You need to be way less
than 10 usually
before you can get anything.

167
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:12,324
10 abv, not 10 proof.

168
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:14,693
So that's your
easy rule of thumb.

169
00:08:14,695 --> 00:08:17,562
Appreciate every
word of advice
you can give me, sir.

170
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:21,700
I'm absolutely nervous
about my competitors,

171
00:08:21,702 --> 00:08:24,803
<i>Because they both</i>
<i>come from big</i>
<i>distillery backgrounds.</i>

172
00:08:24,805 --> 00:08:26,605
[digger] guys, ten minutes.

173
00:08:26,607 --> 00:08:28,206
It's drawing short.

174
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:29,341
[lauren]
is your sugar dissolved?

175
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:30,642
-[jason] yes, ma'am.
-All right.

176
00:08:30,744 --> 00:08:33,311
[jason] turned out
pretty good so far.

177
00:08:33,313 --> 00:08:35,146
We'll see here in five days.

178
00:08:35,215 --> 00:08:36,647
How you doing over there?

179
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:39,251
[lauren] good.
Got a little bit of sweetness,
but not there yet.

180
00:08:43,624 --> 00:08:46,024
-How's the taste?
-Good. Dead on.

181
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,392
Getting some sweet notes.

182
00:08:47,394 --> 00:08:49,327
[digger] five minutes,
boys and girls.

183
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:51,530
Better be
getting that mash
in them barrels.

184
00:08:51,532 --> 00:08:53,398
[jason speaking]

185
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,799
[chip speaking]

186
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,202
[lauren speaking]

187
00:08:59,106 --> 00:09:01,606
Guys, you got two minutes.
Looks like you're done.

188
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:04,676
Why don't y'all head on out?
We'll keep an eye on them.
Good luck, guys.

189
00:09:04,678 --> 00:09:06,711
-[chip] thank you.
-[jason] thank you.

190
00:09:17,324 --> 00:09:19,925
Welcome back, guys.
It's your first run.

191
00:09:19,927 --> 00:09:23,995
Time for y'all to get
that liquor out of that mash
for your carbonated beverage.

192
00:09:23,997 --> 00:09:29,034
What you got at stake, though,
is who goes to
the still parts house first.

193
00:09:29,036 --> 00:09:32,537
If you get in there first,
you're guaranteed to get
a thumper if you need one.

194
00:09:32,606 --> 00:09:34,105
You got four hours.

195
00:09:34,107 --> 00:09:36,474
Your time starts now.

196
00:09:36,476 --> 00:09:37,842
Good luck, guys.

197
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:41,046
-[digger] pretty mash
right there.
-[mark] yeah. Sure is.

198
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:48,853
She's triple filtering.

199
00:09:48,855 --> 00:09:52,223
[mark] she's got a strainer
inside a basket
inside a strainer.

200
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:55,060
That liquor will be called
houdini if it gets out
of there, won't it?

201
00:09:55,062 --> 00:09:56,461
[laughing]

202
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,701
-Jason's already got
fire under his still.
-[digger] yup.

203
00:10:02,703 --> 00:10:03,735
[tim] looks like we cooking.

204
00:10:06,707 --> 00:10:08,273
Yeah, there's fire.

205
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:12,444
-[lauren] what do you think
about my flame?
-[jason] give it more.

206
00:10:12,512 --> 00:10:14,112
-[lauren] yeah, you think so?
-[jason] *bleep* yeah.

207
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:15,547
[lauren] <i>I haven't</i>
<i>worked a lot with pot stills</i>

208
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:17,616
So jason did help me
with running the still.

209
00:10:17,618 --> 00:10:19,217
[lauren] all right, jason.
We're doing this.

210
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:20,952
[lauren] <i>we all</i>
<i>helped each other out.</i>

211
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:25,590
The biggest challenge for me
is to go up against
these two guys

212
00:10:25,592 --> 00:10:27,425
That I really do truly admire.

213
00:10:27,427 --> 00:10:30,128
-Appreciate it, thank you.
-Yes, ma'am. Anything you need
just let me know.

214
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,529
[lauren] thanks, man.

215
00:10:31,531 --> 00:10:33,565
[chip speaking]

216
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:37,302
Chip's having a whole lot
of problems with his mash.
He got a lot of thick grain.

217
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:41,039
[digger] well, boys and girls,
you've burned 45 minutes
of your time left.

218
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:43,441
-How much did you put
in your pot, jason?
-About eight gallons.

219
00:10:43,543 --> 00:10:46,378
Gonna use everything else
for the thumper
for the next round.

220
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:49,748
Assuming that
you come out in time
to get a thumper.

221
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:53,218
I don't assume.
I'm gonna get my first pick.

222
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:56,054
Everything is gonna
really depend on that thumper.

223
00:10:57,524 --> 00:11:01,326
Lauren, do you feel like
your fermentation's
where you need it to be?

224
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:03,962
So it looks like
my fermentation's
still going a little bit.

225
00:11:03,964 --> 00:11:06,331
Could use a few more days,
so I only used
a little bit of mash.

226
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:10,101
And then I'll take
that reserve mash and then
put that into the thumper

227
00:11:10,103 --> 00:11:11,503
And try
to flavor it
elsewhere.

228
00:11:11,505 --> 00:11:14,039
With turbinado sugar,
it sometimes dies

229
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,241
Right when
your fermentation
gets started.

230
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:18,209
Oh, boy.

231
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:23,214
Well, she's gotta win
this first competition, guys,
to get the thumper.

232
00:11:23,216 --> 00:11:26,217
-There might not be
two thumpers in there.
-We shall see.

233
00:11:26,219 --> 00:11:28,553
Good god,
it's getting warm in here
already, boys.

234
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,660
Gotta win
this first competition, guys,
to get the thumper.

235
00:11:35,762 --> 00:11:37,829
Oh, that there will
be coming out
any minute.

236
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:41,800
Ah, dang. There we go.

237
00:11:41,802 --> 00:11:43,835
-[lauren] coming out?
-[jason] yes, sir.

238
00:11:43,904 --> 00:11:45,437
[chip] I'm running.

239
00:11:48,008 --> 00:11:50,041
-[jason] she's running, too.
-[chip] you running, too?

240
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:51,710
[lauren]
mmm-hmm. Yeah,
it just started.

241
00:11:53,246 --> 00:11:54,946
Two hours, guys.

242
00:11:57,951 --> 00:11:59,417
[jason] what proof
you think it is?

243
00:12:00,754 --> 00:12:02,120
Thinking, like, 130.

244
00:12:02,122 --> 00:12:04,522
<i>Concerned about the proof.</i>

245
00:12:04,524 --> 00:12:08,560
Never just used my, you know,
senses as far as taste, smell.

246
00:12:08,628 --> 00:12:10,662
It would be a lot easier
if I had a hydrometer, though.

247
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:12,263
[tim] yeah, y'all
wouldn't make it in the woods.

248
00:12:12,332 --> 00:12:14,299
-I can tell you
that right now.
-[laughing]

249
00:12:14,301 --> 00:12:16,134
[digger] one hour left, guys.

250
00:12:17,537 --> 00:12:18,703
Oh, my god.

251
00:12:18,705 --> 00:12:19,804
It smells a little bit off.

252
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,207
[sighs]

253
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:28,813
It has such a weird flavor
off the bottom.

254
00:12:30,217 --> 00:12:32,050
How can I do this safely?

255
00:12:32,052 --> 00:12:33,818
[tim] what are
you trying to do?

256
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,353
[chip] redistill the mash.

257
00:12:39,226 --> 00:12:42,927
I wanna see if I can put
more mash into the still
as fast as possible.

258
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:44,129
Dude...

259
00:12:45,532 --> 00:12:47,298
-[chip] don't--
-there's not enough time.

260
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,000
[chip] *bleep* it,
I'm doing it.

261
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:51,836
This is what I'm doing now.
I have no option.

262
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:53,204
[mark] what the hell?

263
00:12:53,206 --> 00:12:55,940
-[chip groans]
-[lauren] what's
the game plan?

264
00:12:56,009 --> 00:12:58,610
[chip] I'm just gonna
re-pitch in. See what
I can get out.

265
00:12:58,612 --> 00:12:59,911
[lauren] throw it all back in?

266
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:01,479
[chip] yeah, I'm just gonna do
a second run straight through.

267
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:04,115
[lauren] well, *bleep* try it.

268
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:06,618
I mean, you're taking
a ballsy leap right now
doing what you're doing.

269
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:09,320
If you really feel
like you're behind the ball,
what do you got to lose?

270
00:13:09,322 --> 00:13:10,522
You're gonna bring
up your proof,

271
00:13:10,524 --> 00:13:12,423
It's gonna give
you a bunch more notes
of flavors,

272
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:13,691
And if it works
it's gonna be cool.

273
00:13:13,693 --> 00:13:15,460
[lauren] about to find out.

274
00:13:15,562 --> 00:13:17,695
We've had a lot of risk-takers
in the past.

275
00:13:17,697 --> 00:13:19,230
Didn't pay off
for some of them.

276
00:13:19,232 --> 00:13:20,565
Some of them it did.

277
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,734
[chip] actually,
if I could grab a hand
from you.

278
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:29,674
Either it's gonna work
really well or really bad.

279
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:31,743
[digger] oh, we're getting
tight now, guys.

280
00:13:31,845 --> 00:13:33,211
30 minutes left in your run.

281
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:39,117
[jason] <i>I try not to let</i>
<i>my nerves get to me.</i>

282
00:13:39,119 --> 00:13:41,553
I have a lot of personal
reasons for being here.

283
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:42,954
<i>I carry</i>
<i>my little brother with me.</i>

284
00:13:43,056 --> 00:13:44,856
<i>This is his ashes in this ja</i>

285
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:47,025
<i>He is with me everywhere I g</i>

286
00:13:55,702 --> 00:13:58,102
[chip] oh, *bleep*.
That one's tastes exactly
like I make it at home.

287
00:13:58,104 --> 00:14:00,004
-[tim] amazing
-[chip] I'm very happy
with that.

288
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:02,540
<i>After I re-pitched</i>
<i>halfway through,</i>

289
00:14:02,576 --> 00:14:04,142
<i>The jar had the flavor</i>
<i>I needed.</i>

290
00:14:04,211 --> 00:14:06,711
<i>It's tasty. It's spicy.</i>
<i>It's good.</i>

291
00:14:07,614 --> 00:14:09,314
15 minutes left.

292
00:14:09,316 --> 00:14:13,518
-You bringing it in, jason?
-Yes, sir. I think this is
the jar I wanna turn in.

293
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,819
Thank you, guys.

294
00:14:14,821 --> 00:14:16,721
I bet your brother's
real proud of you
for that jar.

295
00:14:16,723 --> 00:14:18,523
Thank you. Means a lot.

296
00:14:19,326 --> 00:14:20,625
[digger] good luck, buddy.

297
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:24,963
[lauren] <i>I'm concerned</i>
<i>about the proof.</i>

298
00:14:24,965 --> 00:14:26,264
I tend to overthink things,

299
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:28,299
<i>But I thought</i>
<i>the jar that I had there</i>

300
00:14:28,301 --> 00:14:30,235
Was probably the best
that I could present.

301
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:31,469
<i>I was happy with it.</i>

302
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:34,439
I love the flavor, the taste.
It was really smooth.

303
00:14:34,507 --> 00:14:35,740
All right, you guys.

304
00:14:35,742 --> 00:14:37,508
-[mark] is that the one?
-Here is my jar. Thank you.

305
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,377
-[digger] thank you.
Good luck.
-[mark] good luck, lauren.

306
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:42,347
[digger] two minutes, chip.
Time is drawing nigh.

307
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:43,681
Bring it in here, boss.

308
00:14:43,683 --> 00:14:46,150
Best jar I got. Chip 2.0.
It's me, but better.

309
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:48,119
-Thank you.
-[mark] good luck, chip.

310
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:50,355
Let's do a little taste.

311
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:51,823
Chip 2.0.

312
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:54,325
[tim] well, he's looking
pretty high.

313
00:14:54,327 --> 00:14:57,028
He's looking about a 108,
right there.

314
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,429
What do you think
your final proof was?

315
00:14:58,431 --> 00:15:00,932
I'm kind of confident.
120-ish, maybe?

316
00:15:00,934 --> 00:15:01,933
Whoa.

317
00:15:04,104 --> 00:15:05,803
Mmm. Different smell,
ain't it?

318
00:15:05,805 --> 00:15:08,406
-Mmm, earthy.
-Yeah. That's all that malt.

319
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:10,675
-Gotta good smell, really.
-[digger] and it's rye.

320
00:15:10,677 --> 00:15:12,377
[tim] little spicy.

321
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:15,747
Yeah, it burns your tongue,
where you can't differentiate
between those flavors.

322
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:18,416
I think it could be better
if it was a little lower.

323
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:20,618
-Pour us another one, tim.
-All right.

324
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,819
This is lauren's.

325
00:15:21,821 --> 00:15:23,354
[digger] that is lauren's.

326
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:25,623
That's a 100 proof
right there.

327
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,358
My mash wasn't
fully fermented,

328
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,460
Uh, but I'm pretty happy
with the results.

329
00:15:29,562 --> 00:15:32,297
-Oh, that smells good.
-[mark] yeah.

330
00:15:32,299 --> 00:15:36,301
That's got
a really, really good floral,
citrusy note on it.

331
00:15:36,303 --> 00:15:38,703
I think she's spot-on
on flavor.

332
00:15:38,705 --> 00:15:40,271
She's got a fruity note.

333
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:44,242
That would build a real nice
carbonated cocktail
the way it is right there.

334
00:15:44,311 --> 00:15:46,744
-She done good.
-[tim] moving on.

335
00:15:46,813 --> 00:15:48,980
-Jason.
-The backwoods guy.

336
00:15:48,982 --> 00:15:50,248
-[tim] uh-oh.
-[digger] oh.

337
00:15:50,317 --> 00:15:51,916
Oh, he's a little low.

338
00:15:51,918 --> 00:15:53,351
[tim] I mean, he's in the 80s.

339
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:54,952
Uh-oh.

340
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,121
[tim] I don't know
what he's got there,
but it ain't no alcohol in it.

341
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,427
Hmm, a little
different smell there.

342
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:04,362
Of course, he's rye heavy.

343
00:16:04,431 --> 00:16:07,332
-[tim] rye and corn.
-[digger] got that earthy,
grainy nose.

344
00:16:11,504 --> 00:16:13,805
Wow. Yeah, he's got
a good taste, though.

345
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:15,239
Yeah, he needs
to bring that proof up.

346
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:16,341
It's got some power.

347
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:17,842
Yeah, 80, 90.

348
00:16:17,844 --> 00:16:21,913
And once it's carbonated,
high-proof alcohol would
mask your flavor.

349
00:16:21,915 --> 00:16:24,816
Low proof alcohol won't bring
it to the table.

350
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:27,218
I for one am as nervous
as a man can be.

351
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,053
I'm hoping to get a thumper.

352
00:16:29,055 --> 00:16:31,556
-All right, you good?
-[digger] I'm good.

353
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:33,658
-I'm gonna go fetch them.
-[mark] go get them, cuz.

354
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:39,731
[digger] all right, guys.

355
00:16:39,733 --> 00:16:43,101
Now, we tasted three
incredible jars of liquor.

356
00:16:43,103 --> 00:16:45,636
Now, chip,
your flavor's spot on.

357
00:16:45,705 --> 00:16:47,939
Just what I would expect
out of an all-grain.

358
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:50,408
It was really, really good.

359
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:53,111
Your taste profile was
like chocolate ice cream.

360
00:16:53,113 --> 00:16:57,048
You know, it has
a real rich, deep flavor.

361
00:16:57,050 --> 00:17:00,251
[mark] flavor would even be
better if the proof
wasn't so high.

362
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:04,122
-But a damn fine job.
Congratulations.
-Thank you, sir.

363
00:17:04,124 --> 00:17:06,424
Jason, your rye liquor,
brother.

364
00:17:06,426 --> 00:17:08,126
It was spot on for flavor.

365
00:17:08,128 --> 00:17:09,961
Messed up just a tiny bit.

366
00:17:10,063 --> 00:17:12,063
Your proof was
a little bit low.

367
00:17:12,065 --> 00:17:15,500
-That being said,
you did a damn fine job.
-Thank you.

368
00:17:15,502 --> 00:17:18,736
Lauren, your flavor profile's
spot on.

369
00:17:18,805 --> 00:17:20,304
Uh, you used flaked corn--

370
00:17:20,306 --> 00:17:23,041
-Yep.
-...And to me, it's got
an unique flavor in itself.

371
00:17:23,043 --> 00:17:25,943
Your proof is 100.
Great job on that.

372
00:17:25,945 --> 00:17:28,446
[mark] and nobody's going
home here, guys.

373
00:17:28,515 --> 00:17:30,848
This is just for still parts.

374
00:17:30,917 --> 00:17:33,317
Give y'all a pecking order
to pick your still parts.

375
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:34,919
Lauren, you're number one.

376
00:17:34,921 --> 00:17:36,954
Jason, you're number two.

377
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,624
And unfortunately, chip,
you're pulling the caboose.

378
00:17:39,626 --> 00:17:42,460
So, that being said,
get y'all out there

379
00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:43,661
And let you pick
your still parts.

380
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:44,862
Tickle!

381
00:17:45,665 --> 00:17:48,199
What do we got
going on here today?

382
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:49,500
[tim] well, we need
some more still parts.

383
00:17:49,502 --> 00:17:50,835
All right, y'all,
come on with me.

384
00:17:50,937 --> 00:17:51,836
We'll get y'all hooked up.

385
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:54,005
-Good luck.
-[lauren] thank you.

386
00:17:54,007 --> 00:17:55,573
[mark] good job, guys!

387
00:17:57,043 --> 00:17:59,577
We're doing
something a little different
with this still house pick.

388
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:01,612
I hid a snake in there.

389
00:18:01,614 --> 00:18:04,715
All right? But don't worry.
He's friendly.

390
00:18:04,717 --> 00:18:06,951
[all laugh]

391
00:18:07,053 --> 00:18:09,420
We're here
to pick your still parts.

392
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:11,456
You're gonna have
three minutes inside there.

393
00:18:11,524 --> 00:18:13,524
Lauren, you're up first.

394
00:18:13,526 --> 00:18:17,161
Your three minutes starts now.

395
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:18,563
-You better get up.
-[lauren] let's get in there.

396
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:20,498
-You only got three minutes.
-[lauren] all right.

397
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,734
<i>There was a sense</i>
<i>of urgency to be first</i>
<i>in the still house.</i>

398
00:18:23,803 --> 00:18:27,038
Definitely wanted
the traditional pot thumper.

399
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,006
<i>Uh, you know, warm condenser</i>

400
00:18:29,008 --> 00:18:31,943
-Okay, well, I see a pot.
All right.
-[lauren] yes.

401
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:33,311
Have you run
across the snake yet?

402
00:18:33,313 --> 00:18:35,413
[all laugh]

403
00:18:35,415 --> 00:18:37,047
[tickle] he's a big one.

404
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:39,517
[lauren] <i>a lot</i>
<i>of the equipment</i>
<i>that, you know, is here toda</i>

405
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:41,285
I have never had
any experience running.

406
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:43,154
One and a half minutes.

407
00:18:43,256 --> 00:18:46,124
-[tickle] it goes quicker
than you think.
-[lauren] it sure does.

408
00:18:46,126 --> 00:18:47,825
She is coming out
with more stuff.

409
00:18:47,827 --> 00:18:50,328
All right.
We have got a thumper.

410
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,963
You're down
to five seconds, lauren.

411
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:56,100
Four, three, two, one.

412
00:18:56,102 --> 00:18:58,603
-The rest
of those parts are mine.
-All right.

413
00:18:58,605 --> 00:19:00,805
Tell you what, she does got
a box full of stuff now.

414
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:02,306
All right, jason.

415
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:04,408
Your time starts now.

416
00:19:06,045 --> 00:19:09,147
Everything is gonna
really depend on that thumper.

417
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:11,649
[tickle] well,
are you finding
everything you need in there?

418
00:19:11,718 --> 00:19:13,151
[jason] open her up, tickle.
Open her up.

419
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:14,952
Oh, yeah, open it up? Okay.

420
00:19:14,954 --> 00:19:19,857
We have got a condenser
and a thumper.

421
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:21,459
[chip] I'm worried if I'm
gonna have anything left.

422
00:19:21,561 --> 00:19:24,262
[tickle] and three, two, one.

423
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:26,898
-Okay, have you got
everything you need?
-I don't know.

424
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,432
[tickle] make sure. Make sure.

425
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:31,435
And we will let chip have a go
at what is left.

426
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:35,506
Are you ready? You have got
three minutes starting now.

427
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:37,108
I ain't gonna lie
to you, chip.

428
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:40,745
I believe I'd grab every
damn thing that's in there.
All that's left.

429
00:19:40,813 --> 00:19:43,014
It's kind of disappointing
coming in third
for the still house,

430
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:45,116
<i>But I'm gonna grab</i>
<i>whatever else is left.</i>

431
00:19:46,219 --> 00:19:47,718
I'm gonna work
with any equipment I can grab.

432
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,854
We've got a pot
and a condenser.

433
00:19:49,956 --> 00:19:51,355
You've got 30 seconds left.

434
00:19:51,457 --> 00:19:53,824
Seems like forever when you're
microwaving a burrito.

435
00:19:53,826 --> 00:19:56,360
But, uh, it's not too long
picking still parts.

436
00:19:56,429 --> 00:19:57,628
[all laugh]

437
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,197
[chip] what the *bleep*?
Grab it all!

438
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:00,698
Grab it all.

439
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,935
[tickle] this last 30 seconds
goes by real quick, chip.

440
00:20:03,937 --> 00:20:05,203
[chip whispering] oh, my god.

441
00:20:08,942 --> 00:20:11,442
This last 30 seconds goes
by real quick, chip.

442
00:20:11,511 --> 00:20:13,244
[chip whispering] oh, my god.

443
00:20:13,346 --> 00:20:15,613
It goes by so fast, you've
only got 15 seconds left.

444
00:20:15,615 --> 00:20:17,114
[chip] I think I have enough.

445
00:20:17,116 --> 00:20:19,050
-[tickle] are you done?
-[chip] uh...

446
00:20:19,118 --> 00:20:20,651
[tickle] well, you are now.

447
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,720
-[lauren laughs]
-[jason laughs] he's done now.

448
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:25,056
Now that y'all got
all your all's still parts,

449
00:20:25,124 --> 00:20:26,857
Let's roll back
the way we came.

450
00:20:31,764 --> 00:20:34,265
-We made it back.
-Oh.

451
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:35,833
[tickle] yeah, well,
you know, I told them

452
00:20:35,935 --> 00:20:37,602
I hid a snake up
in the still house,

453
00:20:37,604 --> 00:20:39,737
-But didn't none
of them find it.
-[chuckles]

454
00:20:39,806 --> 00:20:42,607
[tickle] uh, I reckon, uh,
they got plenty
of still parts.

455
00:20:42,609 --> 00:20:45,710
-[digger] you be good.
-[tickle] I'm gonna try.

456
00:20:45,712 --> 00:20:48,045
So, hopefully, everybody's got
everything they need.

457
00:20:48,114 --> 00:20:50,548
You got one hour to put
our stills together.

458
00:20:50,617 --> 00:20:52,516
Your time starts now.

459
00:20:52,518 --> 00:20:54,051
Good luck guys
and get with it.

460
00:20:56,823 --> 00:20:58,456
[chip] oh, *bleep*.

461
00:20:58,524 --> 00:20:59,824
I don't know
how I'm gonna do this.

462
00:21:02,228 --> 00:21:03,427
Oh, come on now!

463
00:21:04,831 --> 00:21:07,198
Well, everybody's moving
with a sense of urgency,

464
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,600
-As you say.
-[mark] yep. Chip's going
a little different route.

465
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:12,503
Yes, he's a little bit,
uh, high rise over there,

466
00:21:12,505 --> 00:21:14,605
But, you know, his problem is
connecting that condenser.

467
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:15,640
[chip] oh, come on now!

468
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:18,442
Houston, we have a problem.

469
00:21:18,511 --> 00:21:21,212
[lauren] uh-oh. No go.

470
00:21:21,214 --> 00:21:23,614
I needed a thump post,
but I don't have a thump post.

471
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:26,951
One of your buddies
may have picked one up
that you need inadvertently.

472
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:28,319
You never know.

473
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:30,921
-Is it a thump post?
-Yeah, that's what
your buddies are for.

474
00:21:30,923 --> 00:21:32,356
-They'll help you.
-That's why I love you.

475
00:21:32,425 --> 00:21:33,858
A little still house love.

476
00:21:36,296 --> 00:21:38,829
It's almost like
his arm coming in is too long.

477
00:21:38,831 --> 00:21:40,865
[jason] oh, yeah.
I see it ain't sitting square.

478
00:21:42,101 --> 00:21:44,535
Still ain't setting
down in the burner just right.

479
00:21:45,305 --> 00:21:46,537
[digger] there you go.

480
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:48,939
That's headed
in the right direction.

481
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:51,409
[mark] maybe this might be
a new record time.

482
00:21:51,411 --> 00:21:53,511
Not even ten minutes
ticked off yet.

483
00:21:56,115 --> 00:21:57,615
All right, guys,
you all are done.

484
00:21:57,617 --> 00:22:00,418
That was
a damn impressive time.

485
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:04,221
-[mark] you guys are on it.
-We're looking at 14 minutes
that lapsed.

486
00:22:04,223 --> 00:22:07,325
Your next step is
flavoring your liquor.

487
00:22:07,327 --> 00:22:10,328
Do it in your spirit run,
infuse a little flavor in it.

488
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:11,462
Your going to use
that as a base

489
00:22:11,531 --> 00:22:13,130
For your flavored
carbonated beverage.

490
00:22:13,132 --> 00:22:16,801
But somebody's going home
on this one, so make it count.

491
00:22:17,704 --> 00:22:18,903
You're gonna have four hours.

492
00:22:18,905 --> 00:22:20,404
We wanna see your best.

493
00:22:20,406 --> 00:22:23,207
Your time starts now.
Get with it.

494
00:22:23,943 --> 00:22:25,209
[mark] good luck.

495
00:22:34,821 --> 00:22:35,720
Bam!

496
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:38,856
Oh, yeah.

497
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:46,664
[mark] that's damn flavor
central right there.

498
00:22:49,435 --> 00:22:50,801
So, what are
you over there beating on?

499
00:22:50,803 --> 00:22:52,002
Your, uh... Blackberries or...

500
00:22:52,004 --> 00:22:54,105
Blackberries, some pineapple,

501
00:22:54,107 --> 00:22:56,707
And then, I have a little bit
of pineapple juice in there.

502
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,275
Nice.

503
00:22:58,277 --> 00:23:00,211
[lauren] <i>a game plan</i>
<i>with the pineapple</i>
<i>and the blackberries</i>

504
00:23:00,213 --> 00:23:01,912
<i>Is to heat it up on the top</i>
<i>of the pot of the still</i>

505
00:23:01,914 --> 00:23:04,048
<i>To try</i>
<i>to cook it a little bit,</i>

506
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:05,850
<i>And then I'll put</i>
<i>that back in the thumper.</i>

507
00:23:08,955 --> 00:23:11,255
Chip's got great mash,
he really does.

508
00:23:11,324 --> 00:23:13,624
I wanna see what he puts
in that gin basket.

509
00:23:13,626 --> 00:23:15,326
[chip]
<i>because I didn't get</i>
<i>a thumper,</i>

510
00:23:15,328 --> 00:23:17,027
<i>I'm gonna approach</i>
<i>flavor completely differentl</i>

511
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:18,462
Get some of these botanicals,

512
00:23:18,531 --> 00:23:20,331
Put them
right into this gin basket,

513
00:23:20,333 --> 00:23:21,899
And let it vapor infuse.

514
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:25,302
I've got straw, flower, clove,
menthol, cinnamon stick,

515
00:23:25,304 --> 00:23:28,506
<i>Jamaican chew stick, orange</i>
<i>ginger, and cane sugar.</i>

516
00:23:28,508 --> 00:23:32,243
The drink is
sweet, spicy, earthy.

517
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:33,944
<i>It's got</i>
<i>a really floral punch to it</i>

518
00:23:33,946 --> 00:23:35,446
It's like sweet
and spicy chicken,

519
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:37,848
But it's just
a really fantastic cocktail.

520
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:40,251
All different kind of flavors
going on here.

521
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:43,421
Bet y'all be coming
out any minute.

522
00:23:45,525 --> 00:23:49,627
-It's how we make
the moonshine!
-[chuckling]

523
00:23:49,629 --> 00:23:50,828
[chip] damn, jason.

524
00:23:52,098 --> 00:23:54,064
The rye and oak come
through really good.

525
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:58,702
So, jason, do you typically
put tape around the bends?

526
00:23:58,704 --> 00:24:00,137
-[jason] is it leaking?
-Yeah.

527
00:24:00,239 --> 00:24:01,705
Know how to do that?
Oatmeal paste?

528
00:24:01,707 --> 00:24:03,908
Make it a little thicker
than a biscuit.

529
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:07,044
I'm from minnesota. We don't
typically make biscuits.

530
00:24:07,113 --> 00:24:09,113
-What do you make then?
-Pies.

531
00:24:09,115 --> 00:24:11,348
-A little less as thick
as pie crust.
-[lauren] okay.

532
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,051
-I like the way y'all are
doing business here.
-[lauren] oh, yeah.

533
00:24:14,153 --> 00:24:15,386
[mimics minnesotan accent]
oh, yeah.

534
00:24:15,388 --> 00:24:16,754
[lauren laughs]

535
00:24:16,756 --> 00:24:19,323
Halfway through, guys.
Two hours burnt,
two hours left.

536
00:24:20,126 --> 00:24:21,258
[chip] two hours.

537
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,760
[jason] it's getting
warm in here.

538
00:24:24,096 --> 00:24:25,729
-Yeah, it's running.
-[chip] getting
something finally.

539
00:24:27,033 --> 00:24:29,099
-[lauren] guys, what jar are
you on?
-Three full ones.

540
00:24:29,101 --> 00:24:31,235
-[chip] one.
-I have not collected yet.

541
00:24:31,337 --> 00:24:33,037
Hey, it's... It's not a race.

542
00:24:34,407 --> 00:24:35,339
[lauren softly] there.

543
00:24:35,408 --> 00:24:36,841
Oh, now we're cruising!

544
00:24:40,012 --> 00:24:42,146
Anything go in your thump keg
other than your mash?

545
00:24:42,215 --> 00:24:43,547
Straight cherries for now.

546
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:44,748
For my flavor run,

547
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:46,317
I'm shooting
for a cherry lemonade.

548
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:49,753
I've got some cherries
and then I got some
concentrated lemonade.

549
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:52,623
Gonna pull that tamp
back off of that thumper.

550
00:24:52,625 --> 00:24:54,124
I'm gonna have some cherries.

551
00:24:54,126 --> 00:24:55,426
And then get it charged with.

552
00:24:55,428 --> 00:24:58,429
He's gonna stop and restart
again with cherries.

553
00:24:58,431 --> 00:25:00,564
That's a little bit of risky,
it looked like to me.

554
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,500
It's a little unorthodox.

555
00:25:04,237 --> 00:25:06,203
<i>Let's charge the thumper</i>
<i>with the cherries.</i>

556
00:25:06,205 --> 00:25:08,205
<i>If I can get that cherry not</i>
<i>in there,</i>

557
00:25:08,207 --> 00:25:10,741
<i>I'm gonna start making</i>
<i>my cuts.</i>

558
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:13,744
And once we put
the combination in it,
it's gonna blow them away.

559
00:25:15,915 --> 00:25:17,548
Is that what you're putting
in your thumper?

560
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:20,518
[lauren] yeah. Pineapple
and the blackberries.

561
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,319
-You gonna re-charge it
or what are you doing?
-Yeah.

562
00:25:22,321 --> 00:25:25,222
I've never opened
a still with a thump keg.

563
00:25:25,224 --> 00:25:28,025
It can be dangerous.
They can explode.

564
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:29,426
It's true. They can.

565
00:25:31,063 --> 00:25:32,730
[chip] the flame's off.
You're good.

566
00:25:32,732 --> 00:25:34,932
Oh, I got it. Good.

567
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:40,037
Perfect.

568
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:46,242
Ow.

569
00:25:46,244 --> 00:25:48,445
<i>Because I was doing</i>
<i>such high abvs beforehand,</i>

570
00:25:48,514 --> 00:25:51,048
I was waiting
to fill those botanical jars
to come off it.

571
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:52,917
I've got this access port,
which I'm thinking

572
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:54,752
About just open that up,
toss some extra stuff
right in there.

573
00:25:54,787 --> 00:25:55,852
That's a great idea.

574
00:25:55,854 --> 00:25:58,689
Come on, baby.
I need you to do something.

575
00:25:58,691 --> 00:26:00,724
There's charge number three.

576
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:02,526
-[chip] are you putting
more in?
-[jason] yes, sir.

577
00:26:02,528 --> 00:26:04,728
-[chip] nice.
-[jason] put the heat
to it, baby.

578
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,530
[digger] all right, guys.
One hour.

579
00:26:06,532 --> 00:26:10,000
It ended up being 30 to 45
minutes before it
really started kicking.

580
00:26:10,002 --> 00:26:11,435
[sighs]

581
00:26:11,437 --> 00:26:13,203
But I'm very happy
with that botanical note.

582
00:26:13,205 --> 00:26:15,306
I'm going somewhere with that.

583
00:26:15,308 --> 00:26:16,440
[jason] nice.

584
00:26:17,343 --> 00:26:19,043
And how's your
*bleep* coming along?

585
00:26:19,111 --> 00:26:20,744
[lauren] I don't like it.

586
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:23,280
No, it's just a little hot.
The pineapple's coming
through a little rough.

587
00:26:23,282 --> 00:26:26,584
[tim] what you working with?
What you got there?
Strawberry?

588
00:26:26,586 --> 00:26:29,153
I put a little bit
of pineapple juice in here,

589
00:26:29,221 --> 00:26:32,423
And then I made a, uh,
like a triple berry, uh,
simple syrup,

590
00:26:32,425 --> 00:26:34,325
So a little bit
of blackberry,
raspberry, strawberry

591
00:26:34,327 --> 00:26:38,362
To make it mellow, kind of
smooth it out so it's a nice
tasting drink for y'all.

592
00:26:38,431 --> 00:26:41,031
That's making me
want to taste it.

593
00:26:41,033 --> 00:26:43,434
Chip, looks like you're doing
a little blending?

594
00:26:43,502 --> 00:26:44,935
Just trying to get
my flavor right.

595
00:26:45,004 --> 00:26:46,303
Those red jars down there?

596
00:26:46,305 --> 00:26:48,138
-[mark] yes, sir?
-[chip] that's going to be
my main flavor.

597
00:26:48,207 --> 00:26:49,707
It's a sorrel punch.
Smells like mulled wine.

598
00:26:49,709 --> 00:26:51,542
It really, like,
punches it up.

599
00:26:53,212 --> 00:26:55,980
[mark] very,
very interesting. Lauren?

600
00:26:55,982 --> 00:26:57,648
-[lauren] hi.
-What have you got going
on over here?

601
00:26:57,650 --> 00:27:00,718
Pineapple's coming off
a little hot for me, so I have
some charcoal going here

602
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,621
To try to temper that down
so it's not so aggressive.

603
00:27:03,623 --> 00:27:06,123
-[mark] you're
still grinding, so...
-[lauren] mmm-hmm.

604
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:08,225
You're probably good.
Good luck, hon.

605
00:27:08,227 --> 00:27:10,861
-Thank you.
-Jason, how you doing?

606
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:14,498
My cherries didn't quite
turn out like I wanted it to.

607
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:17,501
That cherry came out
vanilla-y, it's... It's weird.

608
00:27:17,503 --> 00:27:20,404
Well, you know, you get it
where you want it.

609
00:27:20,406 --> 00:27:23,107
But the telltale sign's
in the tongue.

610
00:27:23,109 --> 00:27:24,408
Good luck, jason.

611
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:25,609
-Thank you very much.
-Yes, sir.

612
00:27:27,113 --> 00:27:28,545
30 minutes, guys.

613
00:27:28,614 --> 00:27:30,247
I still think it's
too freaking hot.

614
00:27:30,349 --> 00:27:33,817
Ah, this fudging proof
has got me jacked.

615
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:35,319
I don't know
if I can do anything else
with this *bleep* jar.

616
00:27:39,792 --> 00:27:41,925
[jason] I don't know
if I can do anything else
with this *bleep* jar.

617
00:27:41,927 --> 00:27:46,463
-[lauren] come on, jas.
-[jason] ah, this fudging
proof has got me jacked.

618
00:27:48,701 --> 00:27:50,801
Don't second guess yourself.

619
00:27:50,803 --> 00:27:53,203
We're in mad scientist mode.

620
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,940
[digger] 15 minutes, folks.

621
00:27:58,244 --> 00:28:02,312
Mine is a very deep,
bold, complex jar.

622
00:28:02,314 --> 00:28:07,317
<i>But I wasn't prepared</i>
<i>to do that much mixing.</i>

623
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:10,954
[lauren] as we get closer,
it's becoming more and more
challenging and tough.

624
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:16,026
[jason] you know what?
I think this is the jar, boys.

625
00:28:17,797 --> 00:28:21,699
I've run for 17 and a half
years with my little brother.

626
00:28:21,701 --> 00:28:24,702
This other jar
in the other hand
is his ashes.

627
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:28,238
I put every ounce
of my soul
into this jar.

628
00:28:28,307 --> 00:28:29,673
Your brother's
very proud of you.

629
00:28:29,675 --> 00:28:33,444
[jason]
I guarantee you.
Here it is.

630
00:28:35,448 --> 00:28:36,547
[mark] good luck, buddy.

631
00:28:36,648 --> 00:28:38,081
-[digger] good luck.
-[jason] thank you, sirs.

632
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:39,950
-[digger] that's
a touching story.
-[mark] that's what I like.

633
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:41,952
One minute.

634
00:28:43,422 --> 00:28:45,055
-[chip] thank you.
-Good luck.

635
00:28:45,124 --> 00:28:46,623
-Thanks, guys.
-Head on out.

636
00:28:47,827 --> 00:28:49,259
[digger] these are gonna be
tempered down.

637
00:28:49,361 --> 00:28:50,861
They've probably got
a lot more alcohol

638
00:28:50,963 --> 00:28:52,563
Than what we're gonna see
in their finished product.

639
00:28:52,664 --> 00:28:56,533
Once it's carbonated,
it's gonna have a whole
different, brighter flavor.

640
00:28:56,602 --> 00:28:58,736
-All right, this is chip.
-Looks good.

641
00:29:00,005 --> 00:29:01,939
Man, it's rosy.

642
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,741
I get ginger.

643
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:05,642
[tim] different.

644
00:29:07,313 --> 00:29:09,012
-Unique taste.
-[digger] powerful.

645
00:29:09,014 --> 00:29:11,215
-Yeah, I think it's
a little too much ginger.
-[tim] little bit bitter.

646
00:29:11,217 --> 00:29:13,317
When you carbonate it,
brightens it up.

647
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:16,954
I don't think it's a candidate
for very much tempering down.

648
00:29:17,022 --> 00:29:18,722
No, no alcohol.

649
00:29:18,724 --> 00:29:21,024
Well, pour us up another one.

650
00:29:21,026 --> 00:29:22,326
All right.

651
00:29:22,328 --> 00:29:24,027
First time using pineapple
and, uh,

652
00:29:24,029 --> 00:29:25,729
You know,
it definitely did come
off hot.

653
00:29:25,731 --> 00:29:28,599
Very colorful. Lauren.

654
00:29:28,601 --> 00:29:30,100
It looks like strawberry.

655
00:29:30,102 --> 00:29:31,802
[mark] she kept
saying pineapple.

656
00:29:31,804 --> 00:29:34,438
[tim]
this could be interesting.

657
00:29:34,507 --> 00:29:36,206
I can smell alcohol.

658
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:39,543
-Hmm. Pineapple.
-Oh, I smell pineapple
through and through there.

659
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:42,212
Now we're talking!
Lotta flavor.

660
00:29:42,214 --> 00:29:45,315
Damn. I'm missing
the blackberry, but I'm
getting the strawberry.

661
00:29:45,317 --> 00:29:47,417
Ooh!

662
00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:49,453
I think the game just changed.

663
00:29:49,555 --> 00:29:51,287
That's real pineapples.

664
00:29:51,357 --> 00:29:54,658
Gotta bring that alcohol down
to carbonate it, and I hope
that doesn't hurt her.

665
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:57,060
This is jason. Lemonade.

666
00:29:57,062 --> 00:29:59,830
It was a really good idea,

667
00:29:59,832 --> 00:30:03,100
But I... I was not at all
confident about my proofing.

668
00:30:03,102 --> 00:30:05,235
Ooh.

669
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:07,638
Looks like lemonade,
smells like lemonade.

670
00:30:07,706 --> 00:30:09,706
Smells like lemonade
with a little bit of octane.

671
00:30:09,708 --> 00:30:10,541
[mark] yeah, it's...

672
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:11,608
[tim] little bit
different, though.

673
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:13,143
But he wanted
a cherry lemonade.

674
00:30:13,212 --> 00:30:14,411
I can't taste them.

675
00:30:14,413 --> 00:30:16,013
[digger] I'm not
a huge lemonade fan,

676
00:30:16,015 --> 00:30:17,815
But I just like the way that
that tastes.

677
00:30:17,817 --> 00:30:21,852
I think if he's carbonated it
just like it is and put it
in a can.

678
00:30:21,954 --> 00:30:23,854
If it will carbonate
at that proof,

679
00:30:23,956 --> 00:30:26,223
-That's where it needs
to be done.
-Yeah.

680
00:30:26,225 --> 00:30:28,458
-Are we locked in?
-I'm good.

681
00:30:28,527 --> 00:30:29,626
Well, I'm gonna go fetch them.

682
00:30:35,734 --> 00:30:36,834
Welcome back.

683
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:41,004
You know, we had
three fine jars of liquor.

684
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:43,507
Chip, you had
a lot of botanicals in there.

685
00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:45,008
Man, it was complex.

686
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:47,711
-You really had to dig in
there to try to separate it.
-Thank you.

687
00:30:47,713 --> 00:30:51,448
I do feel like
it's light on the alcohol.

688
00:30:51,517 --> 00:30:54,418
-Jason, you said you put
some cherries in there.
-[jason] yes, sir.

689
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:57,821
I didn't get any cherries.
I got lemonade.

690
00:30:57,823 --> 00:31:00,257
You had plenty
of alcohol in it,
but damn fine job.

691
00:31:00,326 --> 00:31:01,491
[jason] thank you very much.

692
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:04,027
Lauren, I'm picking up
on that berry flavor, there.

693
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:05,963
-And, yes, pineapple.
-Thank you.

694
00:31:05,965 --> 00:31:08,298
And the alcohol flavor
is there too.

695
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,100
I dranked a little bit of it
and I can feel it.

696
00:31:10,102 --> 00:31:11,335
I don't know if it...

697
00:31:11,403 --> 00:31:13,003
If it has to be
proofed down or not,

698
00:31:13,005 --> 00:31:15,305
-To... To carbonate it.
-Mmm-hmm.

699
00:31:15,307 --> 00:31:19,910
Three fine jars of liquor,
but somebody is going home
on this.

700
00:31:19,912 --> 00:31:21,311
It was a tough decision.

701
00:31:24,149 --> 00:31:26,717
But, chip,
your jar bounced you.

702
00:31:26,719 --> 00:31:27,951
Take it home, brother.

703
00:31:29,655 --> 00:31:30,921
[chip speaking]

704
00:31:30,923 --> 00:31:32,356
I'm sad.

705
00:31:32,457 --> 00:31:35,826
But, no matter what it is,
this is the experience that...

706
00:31:35,828 --> 00:31:37,694
I can't tell you
how much it means to me.

707
00:31:37,696 --> 00:31:39,630
It was an honor
to judge you, my friend.

708
00:31:39,632 --> 00:31:40,831
-[mark] thank you, chip.
-Thank you.

709
00:31:41,834 --> 00:31:45,302
That been said, you two
are progressing forward.

710
00:31:45,304 --> 00:31:48,505
So, don't get
too cloudy about it.

711
00:31:48,507 --> 00:31:52,042
Our next step is,
you got to take
what you got built,

712
00:31:52,111 --> 00:31:53,510
And let's get you carbonating.

713
00:31:53,512 --> 00:31:55,345
Head on out. We'll go get
everything together.

714
00:31:58,083 --> 00:31:59,549
-[lauren] easy, guys.
-[tim] thank you, all.

715
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:01,218
-[jason] thank you, thank you.
-[digger] good job.

716
00:32:13,032 --> 00:32:14,531
[digger] welcome back, guys.

717
00:32:16,035 --> 00:32:18,001
Here we go. Carbonation day.

718
00:32:18,003 --> 00:32:21,104
You notice we got
an extra face in here
right now.

719
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:23,106
I'm going to hand it off
to josh owens.

720
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:25,509
He is the king
of chaos and carbonation.

721
00:32:25,511 --> 00:32:28,312
Hey, y'all. I did
this carbonation thing myself.

722
00:32:28,314 --> 00:32:29,947
I know how tough it is.

723
00:32:29,949 --> 00:32:31,415
We're putting co2 to it.

724
00:32:33,018 --> 00:32:34,685
God almighty!

725
00:32:34,687 --> 00:32:36,720
That thing done jumped
20 feet!

726
00:32:36,722 --> 00:32:40,324
It's a pretty tough challenge
and I'm excited to see
what y'all do with it.

727
00:32:40,326 --> 00:32:42,159
[narrator] <i>to carbonate</i>
<i>their moonshine,</i>

728
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:46,463
<i>Distillers will pour</i>
<i>their spirits</i>
<i>into a pressurized keg.</i>

729
00:32:46,532 --> 00:32:49,132
<i>Then, using a co2 tank,</i>

730
00:32:49,201 --> 00:32:52,235
<i>They'll force carbon dioxid</i>

731
00:32:52,338 --> 00:32:55,205
<i>Purging the oxygen</i>

732
00:32:55,207 --> 00:32:58,642
<i>Forcing carbon dioxide</i>

733
00:32:58,711 --> 00:33:01,745
<i>When reaching their desired</i>

734
00:33:01,847 --> 00:33:03,680

736
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:11,922
Bring us two cans
of your best carbonated
alcoholic beverage

737
00:33:11,924 --> 00:33:13,056
Within one hour.

738
00:33:13,125 --> 00:33:15,125
Your time starts now.

739
00:33:15,127 --> 00:33:16,159
Good luck, guys.

740
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:19,429
You pouring
spring water in there?

741
00:33:19,431 --> 00:33:21,698
[jason] yes, sir. I got to get
that proof down.

742
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:24,501
It's up way too high
for a good carbonated drink.

743
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:26,803
And I got to hit it right on,
or it's not going to be right.

744
00:33:26,805 --> 00:33:30,707
So, lauren, I've noticed
you dumped about
10 different things in there.

745
00:33:30,709 --> 00:33:32,075
What's all that stuff been?

746
00:33:32,077 --> 00:33:35,812
Pineapple juice, lemon juice,
a little bit of orange juice,

747
00:33:35,814 --> 00:33:38,815
Fresh blackberries,
and then fresh mint.

748
00:33:38,817 --> 00:33:41,284
And just a little bit
of rosemary
that I'm just gonna bruise up,

749
00:33:41,286 --> 00:33:43,253
See if it carries
over any flavor.

750
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:45,022
I hear you.
A lot of good flavors.

751
00:33:45,024 --> 00:33:46,823
So, jason, what all
did you put in yours?

752
00:33:46,825 --> 00:33:49,860
I've got lemonade
and a lemon oleo.

753
00:33:49,928 --> 00:33:52,062
It was pretty much
a homemade simple syrup.

754
00:33:52,164 --> 00:33:54,364
I really want to get
every bit of that lemon smell

755
00:33:54,466 --> 00:33:56,500
-Just right in your nose.
-[josh] okay.

756
00:33:56,502 --> 00:33:59,302
Guys, you have used up
20 of your minutes.

757
00:33:59,304 --> 00:34:00,804
You got 40 to go.

758
00:34:03,409 --> 00:34:06,209
Oh, we're getting
forced carbonation now, guys.

759
00:34:08,447 --> 00:34:10,313
[josh] how many
pounds of pressure
you putting on there?

760
00:34:10,315 --> 00:34:12,816
This is set at 45 right now.

761
00:34:12,818 --> 00:34:14,518
I want it
to be highly carbonated,

762
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:17,120
And just tingle
real, real hard in your mouth.

763
00:34:17,122 --> 00:34:20,724
<i>I've studied about</i>
<i>the ph levels</i>
<i>holding the carbonation.</i>

764
00:34:20,726 --> 00:34:23,427
I'm really curious
of how my drink's
gonna turn out.

765
00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:25,796
[whispers] you gotta fill
that thing up about
three times

766
00:34:25,798 --> 00:34:27,431
To get nothing but pure co2.

767
00:34:27,433 --> 00:34:29,332
Only, I hadn't seen him
do that yet.

768
00:34:29,434 --> 00:34:31,301
But I'm interested in seeing
what she'll do.

769
00:34:31,303 --> 00:34:32,803
[lauren] <i>I think we're both</i>
<i>gonna bring it.</i>

770
00:34:32,805 --> 00:34:34,437
<i>Our competitive sides</i>
<i>are coming out now.</i>

771
00:34:37,843 --> 00:34:40,510
It looks like jason
is getting ready to put his
in the can over there.

772
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:41,912
He's working on it.

773
00:34:41,914 --> 00:34:44,514
It's not as easy
as you think it is.

774
00:34:44,516 --> 00:34:46,516
You think you're
just putting it in a can.

775
00:34:46,518 --> 00:34:48,819
<i>But I'm cautioning you.</i>
<i>I'd be careful.</i>

776
00:34:48,821 --> 00:34:50,253
Oh, come on, baby.

777
00:34:50,322 --> 00:34:51,187
[machinery whirring]

778
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:53,824
That canning machine
is awesome.

779
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,326
Check that out.

780
00:34:57,863 --> 00:35:00,263
That's killer.
Can I buy that thing?

781
00:35:00,365 --> 00:35:02,299
I want to buy it. I need one.

782
00:35:02,301 --> 00:35:03,333
[digger] of course, you do.

783
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:04,634
[jason] it's pretty neat.

784
00:35:04,703 --> 00:35:07,304
Well, that is about a handy
dandy gadget, ain't it?

785
00:35:07,306 --> 00:35:09,039
[digger] yeah, you'll need
to buy extra cans

786
00:35:09,108 --> 00:35:10,807
'cause when you try
to get one of those set up

787
00:35:10,809 --> 00:35:12,209
You're going
to kill a few cans.

788
00:35:12,211 --> 00:35:14,211
It will mash,
it will twist them up.

789
00:35:14,213 --> 00:35:16,346
That would be a hell of a way
for me to sell my seltzer.

790
00:35:16,415 --> 00:35:17,514
[digger] yeah.

791
00:35:17,516 --> 00:35:20,317
You getting close
to being ready to carbonate?

792
00:35:20,319 --> 00:35:22,419
Yeah. I'm almost done.

793
00:35:24,123 --> 00:35:26,623
Now let's see
your way of carbonation.

794
00:35:36,535 --> 00:35:39,636
[whispers] now, if she purges
you'll know she knows
what she's doing.

795
00:35:39,738 --> 00:35:41,204
The pressure is on.

796
00:35:41,206 --> 00:35:43,306
There's a lot of
different ways
to carbonate cocktails.

797
00:35:43,308 --> 00:35:44,708
<i>Right and wrong.</i>

798
00:35:45,711 --> 00:35:47,043
[ice crackling]

799
00:35:47,913 --> 00:35:50,247
[hissing]

800
00:35:59,057 --> 00:36:02,225
I'm very nervous
to see lauren doing
a couple different things

801
00:36:02,227 --> 00:36:03,627
<i>For her forced carbonation.</i>

802
00:36:04,429 --> 00:36:06,730
He didn't purge his air out.

803
00:36:06,732 --> 00:36:07,964
When he filled it up with co2,

804
00:36:07,966 --> 00:36:09,032
-He just left it.
-[tim] yeah.

805
00:36:09,034 --> 00:36:10,901
I'm quite nervous.
I will not lie.

806
00:36:15,107 --> 00:36:16,172
[josh] I did this
a few weeks ago in the woods.

807
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:17,741
Funny that I'm sitting
here judging it this week.

808
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,342
And how did it turn out?
Do you like it?

809
00:36:19,444 --> 00:36:20,577
It turned out good.

810
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:22,512
I didn't see those, though.
I had to make mine.

811
00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:25,815
I took a 15 gallon beer keg,
I drilled a hole in it.

812
00:36:25,817 --> 00:36:27,350
Now, that would have saved me
some headache.

813
00:36:27,452 --> 00:36:28,418
You should have come seen me.

814
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:29,553
I'd have took care
of you, buddy.

815
00:36:29,621 --> 00:36:30,854
-You sell those?
-[digger] yeah.

816
00:36:30,923 --> 00:36:32,155
I didn't know that.

817
00:36:32,257 --> 00:36:34,224
[digger] you'd be making
your own red bull, josh.

818
00:36:34,226 --> 00:36:36,226
Yeah. They say,
"red bull gives you wings,

819
00:36:36,228 --> 00:36:38,361
But moonshine gives you
four-wheel drive."

820
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:39,829
Sometimes it puts
you in the mud.

821
00:36:39,831 --> 00:36:41,431
Ain't that right?

822
00:36:41,433 --> 00:36:42,432
[all laugh]

823
00:36:45,504 --> 00:36:46,336
[air hissing]

824
00:36:47,606 --> 00:36:49,172
[digger] jason,
I was noticing,

825
00:36:49,174 --> 00:36:52,042
You didn't purge
the air off of it and then,
fill it back up again.

826
00:36:52,143 --> 00:36:53,710
Were you not worried
you wouldn't have enough

827
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:55,545
-Co2?
-[jason] I didn't
want to over foam it.

828
00:36:55,614 --> 00:36:58,949
-That citrus is gonna
take good to carbonation.
-[digger] uh-huh.

829
00:36:58,951 --> 00:37:00,150
I have very little
to work with.

830
00:37:00,219 --> 00:37:01,318
I didn't want to foam.

831
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,320
If I foam, it was over.

832
00:37:04,923 --> 00:37:07,324
[lauren] a little bit
of a foamy action here.

833
00:37:07,326 --> 00:37:08,658
I think she foamed it up.

834
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:12,362
[lauren] <i>having too many</i>
<i>particles can cause foaming</i>

835
00:37:12,464 --> 00:37:14,331
And that's a nightmare
to can anything

836
00:37:14,333 --> 00:37:16,533
<i>That has a lot</i>
<i>of sediment in there.</i>

837
00:37:16,602 --> 00:37:19,102
Ooh, we got
some fizzy fuzz in there.

838
00:37:19,104 --> 00:37:21,538
[lauren] I thought there
was more liquid on the bottom,
but there's not.

839
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,006
I think she's going
to make another batch.

840
00:37:23,008 --> 00:37:24,541
[josh] yeah, it can't be
just a touch light.

841
00:37:25,844 --> 00:37:28,745
-Would you buy a half can?
-[chuckles] right on.

842
00:37:28,847 --> 00:37:30,447
10 minutes, boys and girls.

843
00:37:32,017 --> 00:37:33,817
[lauren] <i>definitely</i>
<i>trial and error</i>

844
00:37:33,819 --> 00:37:36,686
<i>With a different setup</i>
<i>that I have never had</i>
<i>any experience working with</i>

845
00:37:36,688 --> 00:37:39,456
But, excited to have
them drink my canned cocktail

846
00:37:39,557 --> 00:37:40,724
And I think
they'll really enjoy it.

847
00:37:40,726 --> 00:37:41,725
I'm ready.

848
00:37:41,727 --> 00:37:43,126
[jason] all right.

849
00:37:43,128 --> 00:37:45,128
-Good luck.
-Good luck.

850
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:47,130
[jason] hope y'all enjoy
these four cans here.

851
00:37:47,132 --> 00:37:48,898
May the best can win.

852
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,134
Thanks, guys!

853
00:37:51,203 --> 00:37:54,404
Let's bust the top
on these things.
I'm dying to taste it.

854
00:37:54,406 --> 00:37:55,739
[tim] all right. Here we go.

855
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,240
See if we got any fizzy.

856
00:37:57,242 --> 00:37:58,942
[can opens]

857
00:37:58,944 --> 00:38:00,977
That's just like
it's supposed to be.

858
00:38:00,979 --> 00:38:02,312
Whose is it? Oh.

859
00:38:03,148 --> 00:38:04,648
[tim] now, we know
who that is.

860
00:38:04,749 --> 00:38:06,716
Open lauren's other can,
there, tim.

861
00:38:06,718 --> 00:38:08,451
[can opens]

862
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,552
Oh, yeah.

863
00:38:10,422 --> 00:38:11,855
[tim] yeah, all the suds.

864
00:38:14,226 --> 00:38:15,825
It's good as hell.

865
00:38:15,827 --> 00:38:17,494
That's almost orgasmic.

866
00:38:17,496 --> 00:38:19,129
Tastes like a punch to me.

867
00:38:19,131 --> 00:38:21,464
You can definitely tell
there's a little bit
of that oj in there.

868
00:38:21,533 --> 00:38:22,932
-I get pineapple.
-A lot of pineapple.

869
00:38:23,034 --> 00:38:24,234
You definitely
can taste
the pineapple.

870
00:38:24,303 --> 00:38:26,803
It could be a little bit
more carbonated.

871
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:28,505
[burps]
there's you carbonation.

872
00:38:28,507 --> 00:38:32,008
-I put 17 years
into that recipe.
-Mmm-hmm.

873
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:35,245
But I'm really nervous
about how it turned out.

874
00:38:35,347 --> 00:38:36,679
[can opens]

875
00:38:36,715 --> 00:38:39,316
That had a little bit
more pop to it,
it sounded like.

876
00:38:39,318 --> 00:38:40,717
[josh] that's
the lemonade in there.

877
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:42,352
[digger] though,
we still have another can.

878
00:38:42,421 --> 00:38:44,220
Hold on. Thanks, boss.

879
00:38:44,222 --> 00:38:46,623
-[can opens]
-[josh] all right, then.

880
00:38:46,625 --> 00:38:48,625
[digger] it looks
flat coming out.

881
00:38:48,627 --> 00:38:51,027
[tim] it's really, really
light carbonation.

882
00:38:51,029 --> 00:38:52,128
[mark] yeah.

883
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:54,164
[tim] you get
any on the tongue?

884
00:38:54,232 --> 00:38:55,699
[mark] a little. Very little.

885
00:38:55,701 --> 00:38:57,100
It's got a great flavor to it.

886
00:38:57,903 --> 00:38:59,202
This *bleep* is good too.

887
00:38:59,204 --> 00:39:01,504
It reminds me
of my grandma's lemonade.

888
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:02,939
-With a kick.
-[josh] yeah.

889
00:39:03,008 --> 00:39:03,807
Hold on.

890
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:06,743
Okay, tickle.

891
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:08,144
[chuckles]

892
00:39:08,213 --> 00:39:09,979
-Damn, is it good!
-Yeah.

893
00:39:09,981 --> 00:39:11,414
Oh, I'm getting a buzz.

894
00:39:11,416 --> 00:39:13,550
-[digger] well, hell,
you ought to.
-Whoo!

895
00:39:13,651 --> 00:39:17,120
He did a good job.
I just think he lost a step
of carbonation.

896
00:39:17,122 --> 00:39:18,388
I do, too.

897
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:19,522
-Cheers.
-Yeah.

898
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:20,623
-I love you.
-Love you, too.

899
00:39:20,625 --> 00:39:22,425
But I do want to beat you.

900
00:39:22,427 --> 00:39:24,961
-[chuckles]
-I want to beat you, too.

901
00:39:24,963 --> 00:39:26,596
Everybody rock solid?

902
00:39:26,598 --> 00:39:27,931
I'm with you.

903
00:39:27,933 --> 00:39:28,965
[mark] I'm riding
with you, bud.

904
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,033
[digger] well, I'm
gonna go fetch them.

905
00:39:32,604 --> 00:39:34,104
Welcome back, guys.

906
00:39:34,106 --> 00:39:36,106
One of y'all will be named
master distiller,

907
00:39:36,108 --> 00:39:39,109
And win a limited run
of your liquor

908
00:39:39,111 --> 00:39:42,045
At sugarlands
distilling company
in gatlinburg, tennessee.

909
00:39:42,114 --> 00:39:44,614
Jason, there wasn't so much
carbonation on it.

910
00:39:44,616 --> 00:39:46,349
But the flavor was perfect.

911
00:39:46,418 --> 00:39:47,817
Amazing!

912
00:39:47,819 --> 00:39:50,620
I can't believe
you got that out of rinds
of freaking lemons.

913
00:39:50,622 --> 00:39:52,122
I've never heard
of that before.

914
00:39:52,124 --> 00:39:53,957
That's a first for me.
Amazing job.

915
00:39:53,959 --> 00:39:55,825
[mark] I promise you,

916
00:39:55,827 --> 00:39:59,062
Your brother ain't
any prouder of that jar
than I am.

917
00:39:59,064 --> 00:40:01,865
Thank you very much.
It means a lot.

918
00:40:01,933 --> 00:40:05,301
Lauren, your flavors
was off the chain as well.

919
00:40:05,303 --> 00:40:08,204
So, lauren, I saw you
over there with this flavor,
and that flavor,

920
00:40:08,206 --> 00:40:11,040
And I'm thinking,
"what in the world
is going to happen with this?"

921
00:40:11,142 --> 00:40:13,143
But it came out excellent.

922
00:40:13,211 --> 00:40:14,611
You know, that pineapple
that was in there,

923
00:40:14,613 --> 00:40:16,079
It was just
all over the place.

924
00:40:16,081 --> 00:40:18,114
I mean, it was unreal.

925
00:40:18,116 --> 00:40:21,951
But, unfortunately,
both of you
can't be master distiller.

926
00:40:23,355 --> 00:40:24,421
And, uh...

927
00:40:27,559 --> 00:40:30,026
Lauren, you're the next
master distiller.

928
00:40:30,028 --> 00:40:31,961
-Congratulations.
-Thanks.

929
00:40:31,963 --> 00:40:33,563
[clapping]

930
00:40:38,203 --> 00:40:40,036
I'm *bleep* pumped!
Like, I'm excited.

931
00:40:40,138 --> 00:40:43,840
But, it's hard going against
someone like jason,

932
00:40:43,909 --> 00:40:45,408
<i>Who you build</i>
<i>these friendships with.</i>

933
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:48,611
I think that's what really
truly makes it so emotional.

934
00:40:49,915 --> 00:40:51,748
One fell short on carbonation.

935
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:53,616
That's the only difference.
Carbonation.

936
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:55,351
-[digger] yup.
-I thank you all
for your kind words.

937
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,287
You guys are awesome.

938
00:40:57,289 --> 00:40:59,222
[lauren] <i>the title of</i>
<i>master distiller means to m</i>

939
00:40:59,224 --> 00:41:02,859
That I am capable
and able to do this,

940
00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:06,262
As a young woman
in the distilling scene.

941
00:41:06,331 --> 00:41:08,064
And the first thing
I'm going to do
when I get home

942
00:41:08,066 --> 00:41:12,602
Is hit up, uh, jason
and have him build me
a nice copper moonshine still.

943
00:41:12,604 --> 00:41:14,404
Here's to you guys.
Good job, y'all.

944
00:41:14,406 --> 00:41:18,041
She beat a good moonshiner
and laid down
some good liquor.

945
00:41:18,043 --> 00:41:19,409
And she ought
to be proud of that.

946
00:41:19,411 --> 00:41:20,710
Get the hell out of here,
both of you.

947
00:41:20,712 --> 00:41:22,045
Quick, we're gonna
start crying.

948
00:41:22,047 --> 00:41:23,246
Love y'all.

949
00:41:23,348 --> 00:41:24,814
All right, guys.
Congratulations.

950
00:41:24,816 --> 00:41:26,716
[mark] I'm too old
for this much *bleep*.

951
00:41:26,718 --> 00:41:29,018
-[digger] yep.
-[mark] god almighty!

952
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:30,053
[digger chuckles]
