335
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:54,460
But I figure two Goofs
are better than one.

336
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:56,763
Two "goofs" all right.

337
00:23:56,835 --> 00:24:00,134
Just think!
A whole 'nother year,

338
00:24:00,238 --> 00:24:02,570

he didn't say a year. I heard a year.

<i>he didn't say a year.</i>

Ayear's like...
That's forever.

342
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:17,187
You realize this could
severely affect campus hijink-age.

343
00:24:17,255 --> 00:24:20,656
Yeah! And how we gonna
whip those Gammas now?

344
00:24:20,725 --> 00:24:24,126
- With your dad's
"practice interruptus"?
- Listen, guys.

345
00:24:24,196 --> 00:24:27,165
Cut the old man some slack.
He has to be here.

346
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:29,757
He was fired, and he can't find
a good job without a degree.

347
00:24:29,835 --> 00:24:31,894
Fired? Whoa.

348
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:34,530
You mean like
his pink slip was showing?

349
00:24:34,606 --> 00:24:36,631
Don't push it, man.

350
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:40,200
Look, I talked to him
and laid out all the ground rules.

351
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:42,576
No interfering with
the "X" Games practice.

352
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:46,242
No hounding us about schoolwork.
No coming into our room unannounced.

353
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,513
And no acting
like a father.

354
00:24:48,587 --> 00:24:50,680

A-Ahem.

400
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:53,965
Good morning, gentlemen.
I am the Head Librarian,

401
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:56,599
versed in all aspects
of your school's library,

402
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:59,235
<i>including, but not limited to,</i>
<i>fiction, nonfiction,</i>

403
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:01,209

00:28:01,312 --> 00:28:06,306
- How may I help you?
- Hi there, Miss "Marpole-ee."
Marpole. Marpole!

405
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:09,649
My Dad needs a library card.
Could you...

406
00:28:09,721 --> 00:28:12,519
Oh, it would be
my pleasure.

407
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:15,753
We here at the college library
believe that owning a library card...

408
00:28:15,827 --> 00:28:18,057
is a privilege,
not a right.

409
00:28:18,129 --> 00:28:20,893
<i>Consequently,</i>

to your library experience.

Well, yes it is.
