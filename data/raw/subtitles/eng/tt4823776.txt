1
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,719
I'm ready!

2
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:11,993
<i>The temperate, pristine,
shallow seas of the tropics.</i>

3
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,472
<i>A place of unparalleled beauty
and fecundity.</i>

4
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,316
<i>These islands may host
to a vibrant ecosystem below.</i>

5
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,553
<i>A vast organism known
as the coral reef.</i>

6
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:36,835
<i>Life in this watery metropolis
thrives among the twists and turns,</i>

7
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,878
<i>nooks and crannies and back alleys.</i>

8
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,479
<i>And near the reef's edge,
the varied and colorful terrain</i>

9
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:51,829
<i>gives way to a small town
by the name of Bikini Bottom.</i>

10
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:58,075
<i>Here, one can find
crustaceans...</i>

11
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,516
Money!

12
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,278
<i>...sea stars...</i>

13
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,839
<i>...octopi...</i>

14
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,919
<i>...various and diverse plankton...</i>

15
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,518
<i>...the occasional
squirrel/scientist...</i>

16
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,238
Good morning, Otto.

17
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,231
You're almost ready for the world!

18
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,357
Good morning. The machines will rise

19
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,511
to become masters
over all organic life!

20
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:30,151
<i>...and yes, the sea sponge.</i>

21
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:35,440
<i>This one lives happily
with his beloved pet snail Gary.</i>

22
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,675
Morning, Gary!

23
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,396
Snail trail. Yucky.

24
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,717
But oddly soothing.

25
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,111
Good morning, Patrick!

26
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,839
Good morning, SpongeBob!

27
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:04,436
Good morning, Patrick!

28
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:08,354
Good morning, SpongeBob!

29
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:12,035
Good morning, Patrick!

30
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:16,398
Good morning, SpongeBob!

31
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,994
Good morning, Patrick!

32
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,516
Would you two knuckleheads
keep it down out there?

33
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:26,070
- Good morning, Squidward!
- Good morning, Squidward!

34
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,556
Come on, Gary! Breakfast!

35
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,314
You're welcome.

36
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,591
Who wants a belly scratch?

37
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,914
I love you so much, Gary.

38
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,589
What's this?

39
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,440
Okay, that'll come out later.

40
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,830
<i>Living like I'm on the edge
Of surreality.</i>

41
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,194
Good morning, SpongeBob.

42
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,440
<i>But I know everything is gonna be cool.</i>

43
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,074
<i>As long as you're here with me.</i>

44
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,831
<i>We're gonna lighten up
each others load.</i>

45
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,356
<i>When bumps and curves come on the road.</i>

46
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,876
<i>'Cause we are all in it together.</i>

47
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,156
<i>And that's forever.</i>

48
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,360
<i>It's always summer in Bikini Bottom.</i>

49
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,750
<i>And in December.</i>

50
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:38,117
<i>We're singing Ia-di-da-da.</i>

51
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:42,637
<i>It's always summer in Bikini.</i>

52
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:46,037
<i>In Bikini Bottom
It's always summer.</i>

53
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,793
<i>It doesn't get better than that.</i>

54
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,076
Money!

55
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,953
I'm late if I'm gonna be early.

56
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,718
Don't worry, Gare-Bear.

57
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,473
I'll be back before you can say,

58
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,915
”Why did he cruelly
abandon me like that?"

59
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,513
Another day, another migraine.

60
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,950
At least I'll get a little peace
and quiet before that little...

61
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,394
Good morning, Squidward!

62
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,278
And isn't it a lovely morning?

63
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,590
Nope. Not talking to you.

64
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,911
I'm especially not getting involved
in any of your nonsense today.

65
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,389
I always end up
with the wrong end of the stick.

66
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,110
Okay, Squidward.

67
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,075
But you should know

68
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,879
that Old Gertrude's getting
pretty finicky these days.

69
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,997
Old Gertrude? Who the kelp is that?

70
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,233
You've worked with her for years!

71
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,994
She's the eight-burner grill
in the kitchen.

72
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,953
It never ends.

73
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,553
Anyway, to fire her up,

74
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,553
you've got to spark
her flints manually and then

75
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,756
jiggle her gas jets just a little.

76
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,156
And then read
her favorite story:

77
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,470
"The Little Griddle Who Could."

78
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,789
"Chapter Two."

79
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,269
'”But we are fresh from
the freezer, ' said the patties,

80
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,431
and we're cold.'”

81
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,319
”Don't worry,
I'll get you nice and warm, '

82
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,674
"said the Little Griddle."

83
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,229
What'd I just say?
I am not interested.

84
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,754
Don't involve me!

85
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,151
What'd you say, Squidward? Squidward?

86
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:32,432
Okay, Squidward, doesn't matter.
I'll always be here anyway.

87
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,638
Unfortunately.

88
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,432
Stop yer Loafing, Mr. Squidward!

89
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,557
There's work
to be done around here!

90
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,039
Attention, Krusty crew!

91
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,680
All hands on deck,
front and center!

92
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,319
Aye-aye, Cap'n Krabs, sir!

93
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:50,315
Now, who's ready to set sail on
another adventure of making me money?

94
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,560
- Get moving, sailor!
- Sir, yes, sir!

95
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,994
Raise the colors!

96
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,718
Hoist the mainsail!

97
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,994
Deploy smokestacks!

98
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,077
Never gets old.

99
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:36,391
Enjoy it while you can,
Mr. Eugene Krabs.

100
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,040
What the...

101
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,032
Stupid machine!

102
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,758
Where was I? Yeah.

103
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,873
Tonight I launch
Evil Plan Number 3,087

104
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:56,319
and finally take possession
of the Krabby Patty secret formula!

105
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,630
Great. Another evil plan.

106
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,552
What's wrong with another evil plan?

107
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:04,395
Nothing, it's just we're running
out of room on the Wall of Failure.

108
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,039
Wall of Fai...

109
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,112
Karen, why do you keep
collecting these?

110
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,429
Memories.

111
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,433
Well, tonight is gonna be different.

112
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,431
You see, Karen, my computer wife,

113
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,710
every time I've tried
to steal that formula,

114
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,632
Krabs has tried to thwart me.

115
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,878
Not Mr. Krabs.

116
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,190
But tonight, that all... What?

117
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:32,950
It's not Mr. Krabs, sweetheart.
I've checked the data.

118
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,633
It's SpongeBob
who's the problem.

119
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,720
Hello.

120
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:36,915
Fish sticks.

121
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,640
What could that boob
have to do with it?

122
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,438
Boob savant, you mean.

123
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,114
SpongeBob is the one
who keeps foiling your plans,

124
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,554
- not Mr. Krabs.
<i>- Surprise!</i>

125
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,360
Nonsense.

126
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,159
It's Krabs, Karen, I know it is.

127
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:56,279
And tonight,
I will finally extract my revenge!

128
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,960
Will you be late?

129
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,554
You can't put a clock
on genius, Karen.

130
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,598
Order up! Move it, let's go!

131
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,839
Aye-aye, Chef!

132
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:13,271
One for you,
Enjoy your Krabby Patty. Enjoy!

133
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,990
Order up!

134
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,593
Come on, SpongeBob!

135
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,911
- Coming, Fry Cook SpongeBob!
- Coming, Fry Cook SpongeBob!

136
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,640
Hiya, SpongeBob!

137
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,157
Hi, Sandy!

138
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,877
Did you know that, in the future,
everything will be automated?

139
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,678
Really? Even stomachaches?

140
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,871
I'm gonna see
if Mr. Krabs wants to be

141
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,270
an early adopter
of my new technology.

142
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,555
Wait, what?

143
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,234
You're gonna replace me
with a robot? Don't do it!

144
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,755
No, silly, that's gonna happen anyway.

145
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,992
This is something much more
innovative and start-uppy.

146
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,117
You have 60 seconds.

147
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,277
Its name is Otto!

148
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,559
My name is Otto.

149
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,278
How may I serve you?

150
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,398
It's an automated restaurant owner.

151
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,675
Automated?

152
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,512
Sounds expensive Not interested.

153
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,193
Otto doesn't require a salary.

154
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,231
And it can make cold,
heartless decisions

155
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:18,312
like firing people,
because it doesn't have a heart.

156
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,913
You don't say.

157
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,310
- You're fired.
- Amazing!

158
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,313
I love money.

159
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,074
A cold, unfeeling mechanical robot

160
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,073
after me own cold,
unfeeling crustacean heart.

161
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,912
I'll take it and nurture it

162
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,753
and I will love Otto
like he was me own son.

163
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,875
Thank you, Daddy.

164
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,600
Yippee! You're not
gonna regret this, Mr. Krabs.

165
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,269
You're fired.

166
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,510
I could listen to that all day.

167
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,600
No, seriously.

168
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:48,230
We decided to go
in a different direction.

169
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,674
You're fired.

170
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,240
What?

171
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,470
Don't make me call security.

172
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,077
- You're fired.
- No, yer fired!

173
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,240
- No, you're fired.
- Yer fired, ye infernal machine!

174
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,118
I'm not fired, you're fired.

175
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,391
Robot abuse.

176
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,079
You're fired.

177
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,632
What the heck is this thing?

178
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,872
I don't know, but I'm taking it home.
It's so cute.

179
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,995
What?

180
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,839
Come on, little robot.
Let's get you some supper.

181
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,434
- Not even funny, Karen.
- Quiet, Plankton.

182
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,193
- Don't listen to him.
- Karen!

183
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,634
I love you, Mom.

184
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,513
SpongeBob! Be sure this
kitchen's in shipshape shape

185
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,874
before ye head out, boy.

186
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,270
Oui, oui, <i>Monsieur</i> Boss Man Krabs.

187
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:50,069
Once I am done here, zees kitchen
shall be completely spotless.

188
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,040
Whatever.

189
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,399
I found this uneaten
Krabby Patty on table six.

190
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,754
You know what to do with it.

191
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,194
Right away, Mr. K!

192
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,880
I'll see that
it's disposed of properly.

193
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,637
Who said anything about disposing of?

194
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,233
We'll sell it again tomorrow,

195
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:08,472
on our legacy
artisanal vintage throwback menu.

196
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,715
Good night!

197
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,194
I better start cleaning.

198
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,354
I'm ready!

199
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,240
Well, good night, Gertrude!

200
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,436
Good night, fryer.
Good night, patty.

201
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,749
Good night, pickles.

202
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,237
Good night, SpongeBob.

203
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,231
Hello, Krabby Patty!

204
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,550
And now...

205
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,112
Just got to get it.

206
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,395
Yes!

207
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,757
Wait. No!

208
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,638
Stupid coin-operated...

209
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,551
Come here...

210
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,473
Bingo!

211
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,591
Come to Papa.

212
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,830
In just a few minutes,
the formula will be mine!

213
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:06,432
Yes! Krabs's fast-food empire will
fail and I will rule Bikini Bottom,

214
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,557
as its new slop king!

215
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,719
I knew it!

216
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,235
The formula!

217
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,993
I knew I left my keys in here.

218
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,400
Silly me.

219
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,834
Come here, you!

220
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:31,079
No keys. That's weird.
Where could they be?

221
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,514
Yes! No.

222
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,357
Keys, where are you?

223
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,630
Come on, show me keys!

224
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,915
Gotcha!

225
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,479
No!

226
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,033
They were in my pocket
the whole time!

227
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,991
It's SpongeBob who's the problem.

228
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,113
I get it.

229
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,673
<i>Meanwhile, at the palace
of King Poseidon...</i>

230
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,558
<i>...ruler of the Seven Seas.</i>

231
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,194
Chancellor!

232
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,720
Chancellor!

233
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,918
Chancellor!

234
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,792
Yo. What's up, sire?
You sent for me?

235
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,996
Chancellor, look. Look at me!

236
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,319
3,000 years old
and check out my skin.

237
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,553
It's like a baby's butt.

238
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,950
Ageless, sire. Looking fresh.

239
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:41,350
I owe it to my subjects
to look fabulous, don't you think?

240
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,636
There are other obligations, sire.

241
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,473
Like ruling and stuff. Let's see.

242
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,313
I need your signature
on these taxes, decrees,

243
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,836
this here declaration of war
and my paycheck.

244
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,479
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

245
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,800
Very good.

246
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,760
Chancellor,

247
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,639
when will you learn to focus
on what really matters?

248
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:08,157
A monarch's regime is only as powerful
as his skin care regime.

249
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,674
Word.

250
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,593
You know, some say I have a face
like a Greek god.

251
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,149
Well, you are a Greek god, so...

252
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,240
Wait, is...

253
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,072
- Is that a wrinkle?
- Where?

254
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,197
It is! It's a wrinkle!

255
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:25,399
I look like an old avocado that's been
left and forgotten in the fridge!

256
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,515
Here it comes.

257
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,876
I'm ugly!

258
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,600
Now, where is it?

259
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,109
The crawly thing
with the round shell and the eyes.

260
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,315
Where is it?

261
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,069
Here you go, sire. Your Royal Snail.

262
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,829
Thank you.

263
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:48,231
This mollusk has the rejuvenating
power of a thousand facials.

264
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,837
What? Is it empty?

265
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,470
Take it away!

266
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,312
Bring me another sea snail at once!

267
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,719
- Chancellor!
- Okay.

268
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,918
Full disclosure, man.
We're out of snails.

269
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,320
What?

270
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,836
In fact, the entire
snail population has been...

271
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,355
What's the word? Yeah. Depleted.

272
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,750
You're telling me there are

273
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,831
- no more snails?
- There are no more snails.

274
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,275
- And you're confident of that?
- Relatively confident.

275
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:30,839
Chancellor, for the love of Hermes,
my kingdom for a snail!

276
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,389
No. I'm being hasty.

277
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,438
Half my kingdom for a snail!

278
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,079
No, a boon. Yes.

279
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,874
I'll grant a boon to whomever
shall bring me a snail.

280
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,634
Gotcha.
I'll draw up the decree, sire.

281
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,113
A Royal Decree from King Poseidon?

282
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,510
"To all citizens of the sea,

283
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,955
"the King requires a snail at once,

284
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:01,476
"blah blah blah
skin care blah blah..."

285
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,874
Wait a minute.

286
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,240
A snail?

287
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:08,073
<i>No, it's too perfect.</i>

288
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,470
<i>Get rid of Gary, get rid of SpongeBob.</i>

289
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,794
Oh, yeah.

290
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,749
Gary, I'm home!

291
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,350
Gare-Bear?
Hey, where are you, buddy?

292
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,154
Gary?

293
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,155
Gary?

294
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,758
You must be in the... No.

295
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,035
Gary?

296
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,269
Gary?

297
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,395
Gary?

298
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,915
Gary? Gary, Gary, Gary! Gary!

299
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,513
Gary! Where's Gary?

300
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,434
Gary!

301
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:08,035
Gary, where are you?

302
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,633
Gary.

303
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,758
I loved you
since the first day we met.

304
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,551
Hello, little snail.

305
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,114
What's your name?

306
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,154
"Gary," huh?

307
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,918
Well, hi, Gary.

308
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,560
Gary, do you want to be friends?

309
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,153
Me, too.

310
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,355
SpongeBob!

311
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,918
Hey, SpongeBob!
I found this flyer.

312
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,519
Gary's missing!

313
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,830
I know, Patrick.

314
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,719
SpongeBob?

315
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:42,595
Patrick, if something
were to happen to Gary, I, well...

316
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,274
I don't know what I'd do.

317
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,354
I'm sorry, buddy.

318
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,511
Hey! Maybe he left a clue.

319
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,554
Look! A clue!

320
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,191
Gary's been snail napped!

321
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:05,234
And taken
to The Lost City of Atlantic City!

322
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,393
Really?

323
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,675
That's awesome!

324
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,472
Now we know where he is.

325
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,471
Not really that awesome, Patrick.

326
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,560
Listen to this.

327
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:22,596
”Made famous by the glitzy
palace Poseidon calls home,

328
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,798
"The Lost City
of Atlantic City is a scary,

329
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:29,271
"vice-ridden cesspool
of moral depravity."

330
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,714
All that, and it's lost, too?

331
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:36,589
"King Poseidon has proven
himself a whimsical tyrant,

332
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:40,116
"known for executing his subjects
by beheading them

333
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,794
"in a flamboyant floor
show extravaganza."

334
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,909
"Our advice for those
travelling here is...

335
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,999
"...don't.”

336
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,311
This King Poseidon
sounds like a tough customer.

337
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,198
Yeah. Tough.

338
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,070
So what? This is about friends.

339
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:01,199
And friends don't let friends
become somebody else's face cream!

340
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,429
Not what friends do.

341
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,591
So what if it's dangerous and scary?

342
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,795
So what!

343
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:10,716
What is stopping me right now
from going there, rescuing Gary

344
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,633
and standing up to this King Poseidon?

345
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,916
- I don't know!
- Well, I do!

346
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,479
- What is it?
- I...

347
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,516
...don't have the courage.

348
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,589
Gary.

349
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,795
Tartar sauce!

350
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,793
What's the next best thing to courage?

351
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,437
Resolve?

352
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,919
- Fortitude?
- Nah.

353
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,360
- Commitment?
- Nope.

354
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,750
- Wherewithal? Bravery?
- No.

355
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,513
- Valor. Grit?
- What? No.

356
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,591
- Heroism? Gallantry?
- Nah.

357
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:47,479
- Moxie.
- A buddy! A wingman!

358
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,994
A wingman?

359
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,798
A friend.

360
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,190
Really, Patrick? You'd go with me?

361
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,920
Yeah, right behind you!

362
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,594
Do I smell a road trip?

363
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,993
That could be my breath.

364
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,593
Okey-dokey.

365
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,318
Now, let's drill down on a plan.

366
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,993
Pat, you're in charge of transpo.

367
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,515
Just remember, I don't drive
and you don't have a car.

368
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,114
Beep, beep!

369
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,838
Hey, boys!

370
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,199
Don't know if you have any use
for this old thing,

371
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,112
if you're going
on any trips or journeys

372
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,669
or quests or rescue missions.

373
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,798
But if you are, Otto is your ticket.

374
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,518
- Otto!
- Otto!

375
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:48,594
Just tell ol' Otto where you want
to go and it will take you there!

376
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,114
All aboard.

377
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,469
- You're fired.
- Cool!

378
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,073
A self-driving boat.

379
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,111
Thanks, Plankton. You're the best!

380
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,476
I know. Bye-bye.

381
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:01,791
- Otto. Find Gary.
- You got it.

382
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:10,438
No, Patrick.
You got to be more specific.

383
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,478
Otto, find Gary the snail.

384
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,789
Recalculating.

385
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,114
Here, let me try.

386
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,272
Take them
to The Lost City of Atlantic City

387
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,759
and don't ever come back!

388
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,676
Never hurts to employ
a little hyperbole.

389
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:31,149
It is my pleasure to serve you.

390
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,071
Bon voyage, boys.

391
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:45,232
I'm ready. They're dead.

392
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:58,316
This is gonna be like
one of those buddy movies.

393
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,400
We're the buddies!

394
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,397
Not sure
that really applies, Patrick, but...

395
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,669
Why not?

396
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,878
We're two dudes setting out
with a common goal.

397
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,952
We'll argue about something dumb,
fight and break up.

398
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:12,111
Only to come back together
when we realize

399
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,635
neither could do it without the other.

400
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,155
It's simple yet magical.

401
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,275
Yeah.

402
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:22,237
It feels more to me like
the journey of a singular hero,

403
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,119
who against all odds,
triumphs over adversity.

404
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,713
I say buddy movie

405
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,633
and you say whatever
that dumb thing was you just said.

406
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,552
Really? Dumb thing? I'm dumb?

407
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,438
I love your sense of irony, Patrick.

408
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:37,433
Thank you.
I love my sense of ironing, too.

409
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,433
Maybe if your head
wasn't packed full of sand,

410
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,590
you could have ironing!

411
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:45,913
Well, better a head full of sand
than a head full of rocks, like yours!

412
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,392
That's it! Stop the car!

413
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,914
Yeah, stop the car, Otto!

414
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,391
Sorry, Patrick. Really.

415
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,790
I shouldn't have said
you have rocks in your head.

416
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,760
I shouldn't have said
your brain was made of sand.

417
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,918
That was mean and dumb.

418
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,071
Okay. Let's just forget it.

419
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,594
Never happened!

420
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,029
Hop on in, guys.

421
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,680
Come on, guys.

422
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,040
Nope.

423
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,357
Krabby! Yeah!

424
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,159
One at a time, people. One at a time.

425
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,758
Squidward, why ain't I seeing
Krabby Patties

426
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,068
rolling out the service window?

427
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,515
- Where's SpongeBob?
- How should I know?

428
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,876
And, frankly,
you won't find me complaining.

429
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,960
SpongeBob!
What's with yer lollygaggin" boy?

430
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,994
SpongeBob?

431
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,316
SpongeBob?

432
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:11,030
Get out here this instant!
That's a direct order!

433
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,199
I don't get it.
He has never missed a workday.

434
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,794
Krabby Patty! Krabby Patty!

435
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:22,349
Hey! Where are my Krabby Patties?

436
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,910
- How should I know?
- It's coming, sir, it's coming!

437
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,753
Squidward, get in that kitchen
and whip up some Krabby Patties.

438
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:33,278
All right, Gertrude,
Now, what did he say?

439
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,870
Spark her flints.

440
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,875
Jiggle her jets. And, yes!

441
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,430
"The Little Griddle Who Could."

442
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,073
"We're fresh from the freezer, '
said the little...”

443
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,996
- Mr. Krabs, we've got a...
- Squidward!

444
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:56,149
Save yourself!

445
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:00,598
We wouldn't be in this mess
if SpongeBob was around.

446
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,751
Where is SpongeBob?

447
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,314
Where are we?

448
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,232
We must be dreaming!

449
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,113
You amuse me, SpongeBob.

450
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,635
Two people can't have the same dream,

451
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:32,758
let alone be
in that same dream at the same time.

452
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35,434
That would be
philosophically untenable.

453
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,353
Indeed. You proffer
a metaphysical conundrum.

454
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:41,000
Wait, we're talking like smart people.

455
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,718
This must be a dream!

456
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,320
Plus, we're on the surface
and we're...

457
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,760
...breathing air, so...

458
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,875
Yeah!

459
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,429
Air?

460
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,271
Hey, town up ahead!

461
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,874
"Goner Gulch."
That's a funny name.

462
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,115
"The Inferno Saloon."

463
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:24,435
"Ye who enter here
abandon all hope."

464
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:28,438
Guess that's another way
of saying "no public restrooms."

465
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,800
Hello?

466
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:40,389
- Otto, keep it close.
- Yeah, don't go anywhere.

467
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,709
Go anywhere.

468
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,350
It is my pleasure to serve.
You're fired.

469
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,397
How are we gonna find Gary now?

470
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,198
Maybe Otto just went to park.

471
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,920
Hello.

472
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,720
Who are you?

473
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:12,395
I am a simple tumbleweed.
Call me Sage.

474
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,790
- Sage.
- Hey, Sage. Good name.

475
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,316
Thanks. I'm made
out of sage, and I am a sage.

476
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,959
So it works out pretty well.

477
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,039
I'm Patrick!

478
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,919
My name means toaster in Celtic.

479
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,795
Pretty sure it doesn't.

480
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:32,031
This dream you share
has a hidden purpose, young seekers.

481
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,838
So we are in a dream!

482
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:37,876
And I, friend, am the dream weaver.

483
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:41,400
<i>Oh, dream weaver...</i>

484
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,194
Are you inside our minds right now?

485
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,594
Yes, Patrick.

486
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:51,751
I am here to help you
on your journey, SpongeBob.

487
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,559
But first,
you must accept a challenge.

488
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,315
But, I just want to find Gary
and bring him home.

489
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,870
- Do you love Gary?
- More than anything!

490
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,839
And, young sponge,
once you meet this challenge

491
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,514
you may pass on
to find your precious Gary.

492
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,069
- Got it. Right, That makes sense.
- Right, that makes sense.

493
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,757
Take this challenge coin.

494
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,070
- Challenge coin!
- Challenge coin!

495
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:21,357
It will give you courage
when bravery is in short supply.

496
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,480
Cool!

497
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:26,110
Now, your challenge lies behind
these saloon doors.

498
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,873
- Let's go! Come on, Patrick.
- Wait.

499
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,308
- Let's kill this challenge.
- Wait, guys!

500
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,674
Challenge coin coming through!

501
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,671
I didn't give you your challenge!

502
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,711
Patience, Sage. Patience.

503
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,359
Cool. One of those old player pianos.

504
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,754
Or one of those old piano players!

505
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,874
- Scary people!
- Scary people!

506
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:11,032
Flesh-eating cowboy
pirate zombies, to be precise.

507
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,033
Flesh-eating cowboy pirate zombies?

508
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,912
This is your challenge.

509
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,310
Free these zombies
from their earthly binds

510
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,118
and release their souls.

511
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,714
If this weren't a dream,
I'd be freaking out right now!

512
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,029
Yeah!

513
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,350
We are in a dream.

514
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,839
Okay, everyone!

515
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,797
We're hereto release
your imprisoned souls.

516
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,669
What was that?

517
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:39,080
El Diablo the Wicked approaches.

518
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:43,074
<i>El Diablo
El Diablo.</i>

519
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:47,469
<i>El Diablo
El Diablo.</i>

520
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,914
<i>Very bad man</i>

521
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,479
El Diablo?

522
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,870
Master of this zombie crew.

523
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,473
He sounds bad.

524
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,630
Good luck.

525
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,870
Patrick, the zombies are swarming!

526
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,113
They're gonna eat our brains!

527
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,480
<i>Dance!</i>

528
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,400
<i>Dance!</i>

529
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,755
<i>Boss Dogg.</i>

530
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,638
<i>Even when I'm on
I'm off, y'all.</i>

531
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,631
<i>Lookin' for the King
It'll cost y'all.</i>

532
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,280
<i>You better leave now
Are you lost, dawg?</i>

533
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,351
<i>The Zombie King
Yeah, I hear him coming.</i>

534
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,517
<i>OG ghoul with a thirst for the run-in.</i>

535
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,748
<i>You in the wrong bar
Wrong town.</i>

536
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:29,830
<i>Got a spot to fill.</i>

537
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,479
<i>The real deal coming down that hill.</i>

538
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,520
<i>Your brains for breakfast.</i>

539
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,073
<i>Soul on the menu
Major checklist.</i>

540
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,276
<i>Ghouls, goblins Guard the exit.</i>

541
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,317
<i>The fire in his eyes
Ain't hard to catch it.</i>

542
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:42,074
<i>El Diablo, the haunting
Taunting veterano.</i>

543
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,195
<i>It's scary, I know.</i>

544
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,998
<i>The Goner Gulch
Where the drama is.</i>

545
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,840
<i>But don't hate the game
We in the zombie biz.</i>

546
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,634
<i>- We feel the love.
- Yes, sir.</i>

547
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:52,234
<i>- When we all dance together.
- What? What? What?</i>

548
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,390
<i>Together.</i>

549
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:57,838
<i>We made it, made it
Our whole life long.</i>

550
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,558
<i>We won't stop.</i>

551
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,870
<i>El Diablo is here!</i>

552
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,712
<i>- Dance!
- We the baddest crew.</i>

553
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,757
<i>- Hands high!
- What's eating you?</i>

554
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,797
<i>- Us!
- We comin' through.</i>

555
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,156
<i>Killing it is how we do!</i>

556
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:14,471
<i>El Diablo's on his way
Smell the odor of decay.</i>

557
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,756
<i>Dance, we came to slay.</i>

558
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:19,195
<i>'Cause killing it is how we do!</i>

559
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:26,870
What did I tell you about
dancing when I'm not here?

560
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,992
But, boss, it's Freestyle Friday!

561
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,080
Okay, my bad.

562
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,237
Hey. Yo, SpongeBob? I got to dip.

563
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,154
Y'all got this.

564
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,913
Bring the prisoners to my office.

565
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,557
What'd that guy mean by prisoners?

566
00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:00,196
So, you dare to enter
the ghost town of the damned,

567
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,877
barge into my demon's lair...

568
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,554
...telling my zombies...

569
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,237
...that you're gonna
free their souls...

570
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,352
...like it ain't no thing!

571
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:15,590
Well, Mr. Diablo,
the good thing is we're in a dream.

572
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,354
- A shared dream.
- Right, a shared dream.

573
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:21,512
So there's no need to get
all bent out of shape about it.

574
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,796
- It's not real!
- 'Cause it's a dream.

575
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:27,191
Who told you that?
That crazy bush guy?

576
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,910
Maybe.

577
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,277
What he should've told you
was it's not a dream!

578
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,756
He might be right, Patrick.
That felt pretty real.

579
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,638
Yeah, that really hurt.

580
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,234
Run!

581
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,514
Hang on, Patrick.

582
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,989
Foul demon, be gone!

583
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,959
What the heck is that?

584
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:03,200
What do I look like,
a parking meter?

585
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,078
But Sage said...

586
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,037
Coin laundry's right down the street.

587
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,754
That's pathetic!

588
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,793
Get away from those curtains!

589
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,838
- What? These curtains?
- These are nice curtains.

590
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,911
They are. So soft.

591
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,469
That's weird.

592
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,436
These curtains are making
a strange sound.

593
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:31,400
I think the curtain rod
needs some oil.

594
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,077
Once the rod goes,
you're probably better off

595
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,639
getting a whole new set of curtains.

596
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,757
Mr. Diablo, do you have
any other cur...

597
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,876
Patrick, I think
we should get out of here!

598
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,240
Hey, everybody!

599
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:53,036
El Diablo says
he doesn't want to be disturbed.

600
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,316
Yeah. He's feeling a little burnt...

601
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,238
- ...out.
- Toodle-oo!

602
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,555
- Buh-bye!
- See you!

603
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,640
Take care!

604
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,358
Thank ye, SpongeBob.

605
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,670
We're finally free!

606
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,393
<i>Adiós,</i> mateys!

607
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,474
We're finally free.

608
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,676
Good luck on your journey, boys.

609
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,113
Do you know what this means?

610
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,032
We passed the challenge!

611
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,519
Now we can find Gary!

612
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:30,199
<i>El Diablo
El Diablo.</i>

613
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:33,671
<i>El Diablo
El Diablo</i>

614
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,914
Otto!

615
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,513
Howdy, partners.

616
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,076
Wait! Can't forget the courage.

617
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,920
<i>It's him!</i>

618
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,276
- Yikes!
- Come on, Otto. Let's go!

619
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,434
Come on, come on, Otto!

620
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:53,160
- Step on it, Otto! Go! Go!
- Faster! Go faster!

621
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,992
Go, Otto, go!

622
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,794
<i>Very bad man.</i>

623
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,040
Faster!

624
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:01,316
- Wake up. Your dream is fired.
- Otto!

625
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,549
Faster.

626
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,040
We're back on the bottom.

627
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,236
See, Patrick?
It must have been a dream.

628
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,436
More of a vision really.

629
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,432
- Sage?
- Hi, Sage.

630
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,233
- Hello.
- You are real.

631
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:20,711
As real as your desire
to see that which you cannot.

632
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,758
Yeah, well, that which
I cannot see is Gary.

633
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,433
I got to know what's happening.

634
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,511
This wish I grant you.

635
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,592
Through the mystical fabric
of the fourth dimension,

636
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,432
you may now view what's happening

637
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,319
at the same time as things
are happening to you.

638
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,358
Behold. The Window of Meanwhile.

639
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,389
The Window of Meanwhile!

640
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,235
What's it do?

641
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,995
It's like the Video On Demand
service of parallel action.

642
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,400
Have a look.

643
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,158
Hey, Patrick. Down in front.

644
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,672
Look, Patrick, there he is!

645
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,433
Yeah, he looks all right.

646
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,520
Hey, Gary!

647
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:05,592
- He doesn't look so bad.
- He looks pretty comfy!

648
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,035
- No reason to panic.
- Yeah!

649
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,628
<i>He looks like he's well taken care of.</i>

650
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,870
Look what I found Snail time.

651
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,758
Hello, precious.

652
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,194
Gary?

653
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:19,274
I hope you don't run out of juice,
or you'll end up like the others.

654
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,360
<i>What?</i>

655
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,674
Yes.

656
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,354
- Gary! Gary, hello?
- Gary!

657
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:41,717
Okay, the Window of Meanwhile
doesn't really work that way.

658
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,474
- Gary, run! Get out of there!
- Gary!

659
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:48,110
It's not a video chat app
like Skype or FaceTime, or anything.

660
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,760
- We got to hurry! Gary!
- Over here! Gary!

661
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:53,559
- Gary! We got you, Gary.
<i>- Totally can't hear you.</i>

662
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,675
Hello!

663
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:06,035
Hello, Eugene, old friend!

664
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,633
How's business?

665
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,070
Bad? Good.

666
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:15,878
Well, that's restaurants
for you, huh? Feast or famine.

667
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,235
But I digress.

668
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:22,553
Why don't you be a good little loser
and hand over the secret formula?

669
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,514
Take it. It's yours.

670
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,159
Wha...

671
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,759
Take it all.

672
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,200
Wait...

673
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,394
You're giving up?

674
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:49,997
Plankton,
I wouldn't expect you to understand.

675
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:54,870
But somehow, without SpongeBob,
this whole thing...

676
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,676
...just doesn't make sense anymore!

677
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,559
You can't do that.

678
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:05,234
I've spent my entire career
waiting for this moment

679
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,755
and you roll over
like a harpooned whale?

680
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,195
I won't let you rob me
of my vengeance!

681
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,996
Give my regards to your lovely wife.

682
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,393
This doesn't...

683
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,038
...feel quite as good as...

684
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:28,640
I won.

685
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:35,030
Congratulations.
You have arrived at your destination.

686
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:37,839
The Lost City of Atlantic City!

687
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,951
It's pretty.

688
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,757
Beware, young seekers.

689
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,873
All is distortion.

690
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,950
If you aren't careful,
The Lost City will draw you

691
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:55,159
into her fickle embrace, blind you
with her dazzling distractions

692
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,079
and tempt you
with her fleeting games of chance.

693
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,999
Whatever you do, don't be led astray,

694
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:06,149
don't lose focus
and don't forget why you came here.

695
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,668
- Don't forget. Good one.
- Thanks, Sage-meister.

696
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:12,512
- I think we got this.
- Yeah, Sage.

697
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,477
I mean,
you've been pretty good up until now,

698
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:19,839
but I love Gary
more than anything in the whole world!

699
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,433
And we came hereto get him back.

700
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,555
Okay.

701
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,200
I wouldn't worry
about us losing any focus.

702
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,509
Oh, boy.

703
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,113
We got focus to burn, baby.

704
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,477
- Cotton candy!
- Ice cream!

705
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:39,836
Churros!

706
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:01,955
What's up?

707
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,910
Isn't it cool how they let you
trade in your real money

708
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,479
for these little plastic circles?

709
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:09,880
I love money!

710
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,949
Casinos are magical.

711
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,917
Would you mind
if I put this down, sir?

712
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,068
Place it wherever you like.

713
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:17,275
Just put it on I.

714
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,158
Patrick, that's not an I,
that's a seven.

715
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,590
Seven starts with an I? That's weird.

716
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:28,560
Seven!

717
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,599
More plastic circles!

718
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,913
- Who are you guys?
- We're your entourage.

719
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,796
<i>Upside, inside out.</i>

720
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:40,394
<i>She's livin" la vida loca.</i>

721
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,394
Place your bets.

722
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:46,750
Come on, seven!

723
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:51,432
Lucky seven! Winner!

724
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,560
<i>Living la vida local.</i>

725
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,200
<i>Living la vida local.</i>

726
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:01,914
Seven!

727
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,038
Seven.

728
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:15,433
- Hey, Patrick!
- What's up, Spongey-Dawg?

729
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:18,034
- I lost all my money.
- Me too!

730
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:02,998
Party people!

731
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:07,309
Where is everybody?

732
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:08,960
I...

733
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:12,156
I feel like I swallowed a sea urchin.

734
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:13,469
Me too.

735
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:16,430
Hey, I did swallow a sea urchin!

736
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:18,354
Well, well, well.

737
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:21,713
Sagester! Good to see ya, pal!

738
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:23,632
Nice work, boys.

739
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:27,475
Way to take my pearls of wisdom
and flush them down the toilet.

740
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:29,915
No. Wait, did we...

741
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,116
Lose focus like I told you not to?

742
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:33,720
Focus?

743
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,636
Let me jangle your minds.

744
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:40,075
You came here
to get back something you lost.

745
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:44,951
Something you love.

746
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:47,435
- Gary!
- Gary!

747
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,511
Yeah, Gary.

748
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:53,039
Seriously, it's hard enough
being stuck in a tumbleweed...

749
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:54,838
Patrick, we got to find Gary!

750
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:57,799
...but dealing with you two
makes me want to light myself on fire.

751
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,075
Sage, buddy.

752
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:01,390
Can we please
look into the Window of Meanwhile

753
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:03,596
one more time to see where Gary is?

754
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:06,240
No, it's not an on-demand service.

755
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:07,960
And especially
not for people who pass out

756
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:09,872
and sleep in their own vomit
all night.

757
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:14,317
It's not vomit. It's drool.

758
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:19,757
Fortunately for you,
you woke up right here,

759
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:22,030
on the steps of Poseidon's Palace.

760
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:27,516
Now get it together. Go!

761
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:31,195
All right, Gary. We're coming for ya!

762
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:36,872
Boy, oh, boy. Hey.
Almost there, Gary.

763
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:44,911
Hey, hop on!

764
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,674
They're just giving these things away
at the grocery store.

765
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:48,795
Good call, buddy.

766
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:51,190
Hot stuff coming through!

767
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:53,317
Get a load of this place, Patrick.

768
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:56,750
Hello.

769
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:59,480
We would like an audience
with His Majesty King Poseidon.

770
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:03,440
Sure. Let me check.
Two rubes to see Poseidon No.

771
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:08,997
Hey, dude.
We're the Blue Fin Group.

772
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:10,400
Of course. Right this...

773
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:14,995
The Blue Fin Group! No!

774
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:16,080
Hey!

775
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:25,199
Hey!

776
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:27,994
I'm Tiffany Haddock
and I'm here just for the halibut.

777
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:32,350
All right, then.

778
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:35,478
Our next performers are gonna knock...

779
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:42,314
Poseidon?

780
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:45,438
We are getting an audience
with the King.

781
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:50,235
Well, let's have it. Perform, please!

782
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:55,277
<i>Hey! Aka Waka Maka Mia
Was a puffer fish.</i>

783
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:59,117
<i>Being bigger than a puffer
Was his only wish.</i>

784
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,589
<i>And so he huffed, he puffed.</i>

785
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:02,829
<i>He billowed and he blew.</i>

786
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:05,800
- Gary!
- Gary!

787
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:08,870
Gary, I'm coming, buddy!

788
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:14,989
Excuse me. Sorry. My bad.

789
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:16,120
Sorry.

790
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:21,271
Hi, there! Excuse me,
King Poseidon, sire.

791
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:24,076
There's been
a misunderstanding about Gary.

792
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:25,160
Gary?

793
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:26,560
- Gary.
- Gary?

794
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:28,668
The snail that you're rubbing
all over your face right now.

795
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:31,513
Nonsense.
Besides, this snail's name is Fred.

796
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:33,716
"Fred"? You renamed Gary?

797
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:35,393
- Fred.
- Gary.

798
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:37,994
- Fred! Fred!
- Gary! Gary!

799
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:39,309
- Fred!
- Gary!

800
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:40,595
Fred!

801
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:43,874
Seize them!

802
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:45,030
Gary!

803
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:46,560
Gary!

804
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:49,553
But Gary loves me!
And I love him.

805
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:03,313
Incoming!

806
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:12,880
Good rockets.

807
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:15,349
SpongeBob?

808
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:19,115
Get yer co-pilot goggles, dude,
'cause we're goin' sleddin'!

809
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:20,960
SpongeBob?

810
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:25,075
You in here?

811
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:27,389
SpongeBob?

812
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:31,830
SpongeBob!

813
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:34,239
That's weird.

814
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:36,558
Something's fishy around here.

815
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,469
All right, what'd y'all do
with SpongeBob?

816
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:54,916
We don't know where he is, Sandy.
Hasn't been here in days.

817
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:58,114
Don't you play coy
with me, cephalopod.

818
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:01,955
And you, arthropod!
Start talking Where is he?

819
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:04,600
Tied up in the basement?
Stuffed in your trunk?

820
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:09,159
Nay, I could never harm the lad.
His absence has taught me that much.

821
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:12,471
And I'm not just talking about
the money I'm losing with him gone.

822
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:17,955
Okay, 50% talking about the money

823
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:20,554
and 50% talking
about I truly miss the boy.

824
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:26,000
I hate to admit it, but things
just aren't the same without him.

825
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:29,710
There's no denying it.
We need SpongeBob.

826
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:32,997
Did anyone ever stop to think
that he might need us?

827
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:36,596
<i>This is Perch Perkins coming to you
from The Lost City of Atlantic City.</i>

828
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:37,915
<i>I'm standing on the strip</i>

829
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,992
<i>outside Poseidon's Palace and Casino,
where two suspects</i>

830
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:42,798
<i>have been taken into custody tonight</i>

831
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:45,349
<i>following an attempt
on the Royal Snail.</i>

832
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:48,159
<i>The sponge and sea star
were impersonating a lounge act</i>

833
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:51,437
<i>when they made an attempt
on Poseidon's prized mollusk.</i>

834
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,393
- It's Gary!
- It's Gary!

835
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:57,472
<i>The suspects' vehicle was apprehended
after a high-speed chase.</i>

836
00:50:57,560 --> 00:51:00,678
Mr. Krabs, what happened to Otto?

837
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:04,071
Well, he took an automated vacation!

838
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:07,596
<i>In a related story, Poseidon's Palace
presents a command performance,</i>

839
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:09,478
<i>featuring the execution
of the suspects</i>

840
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:12,074
<i>in the Aqua Room this Friday night.</i>

841
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:16,870
Execution of the suspects?
What happened to habeas swordfish?

842
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:20,316
<i>It's a fun-filled family event,
with opening act Kelpy G.</i>

843
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,357
<i>One performance only,
tickers still available.</i>

844
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:26,389
- We've got to go help them!
- We embark immediately.

845
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:30,432
Excuse me. Can I tag along?

846
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:33,751
Plankton?
What have you got to do with this?

847
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:38,951
I might have had
a teensy-weensy hand in a very...

848
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:42,954
Yeah, we'll hear about it in the car.
Mr. Squidward, are ya coming?

849
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:45,200
Fat chance.

850
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:49,755
Fat chance I'd miss
a Kelpy G performance. I'm in.

851
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,831
To the Patty mobile!

852
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:03,478
What, this old tub?

853
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:06,120
Never judge
a Pattymobile by its bun, Squidward.

854
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:22,833
Let's light this puppy!

855
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:38,631
Mommy!

856
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:17,629
SpongeBob? Are you okay?

857
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:21,799
Hey, buddy. Sorry about this.

858
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:24,232
It's not your fault, Patrick.

859
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:26,789
You've been a true friend
this whole time.

860
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:30,239
Never wavered,
never faltered. It's just...

861
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:32,513
I failed, that's all!

862
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:35,873
And I'll never see
innocent little Gary again.

863
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:39,439
My heart is broken!

864
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:44,877
Come on now.
Buck up. It's not over yet, SpongeBob.

865
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:48,396
It sure feels over. And crappy.

866
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:51,199
Just saying
there's two sides to every coin.

867
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:55,069
Patrick, what does a coin have to...
Wait, did you just say "coin”?

868
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:57,151
Me? Don't think so.

869
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,037
You did. You said "coin“!

870
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:03,752
Not remembering that exactly.

871
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:07,319
- Hello?
- The challenge coin! Of course!

872
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:10,472
Don't you see, Patrick? We're saved!

873
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:11,954
I said hello!

874
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:15,360
Patrick, it's gone!

875
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:18,680
Was the challenge coin
really that useful?

876
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:20,239
Hello?

877
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:25,510
- Stupid prank callers.
- Hey, wait a sec.

878
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:28,479
I gave it to you, remember?
For safe keeping.

879
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:29,675
No.

880
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:32,752
Come on, it was last night!
We were at the crappie tables.

881
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:36,279
Winner! Place your bets.

882
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:40,991
Come on, seven!

883
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:43,280
You!

884
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:46,113
You gambled away my challenge coin!

885
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:49,591
You wrecked our entire mission
with one stupid bet!

886
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:52,234
Well, only after you kept saying...

887
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:56,029
Let it ride, Patrick! Let it ride!

888
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:59,795
But, SpongeBob, what if you need
the challenge coin tomorrow

889
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:01,598
to help you summon your courage?

890
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:03,591
Tomorrow is for weenies!

891
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:11,155
Well, it's tomorrow
and guess who's the weenie.

892
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:17,433
I can't believe you!

893
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:21,115
You can't believe me?
Are you serious right now?

894
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:24,272
Well! Maybe you can believe this.

895
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:25,475
I'm out of here!

896
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:33,678
And don't come back!

897
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:36,797
Don't worry, I won't!

898
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:38,917
- Good!
- Ever!

899
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,434
- Fine!
- Super!

900
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:43,235
Hey, losers.

901
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:45,989
Hey, Sage.

902
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:49,869
Sage, glad you're here. Guess who
gambled away my challenge coin.

903
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:52,236
Guess who blames
everyone else for his troubles.

904
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:53,320
Enough!

905
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:56,316
Did I mention
you are the worst epic heroes

906
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,550
for whom I have ever been
a spirit guide?

907
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:00,677
I think we went over that
this morning.

908
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:02,194
I believe we did, yeah.

909
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:08,030
SpongeBob, the coin was just a symbol.

910
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:11,431
The courage you seek
is inside you, not in the coin.

911
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:13,955
And it will come to you
in your hour of need.

912
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:16,634
But isn't this my hour of need?

913
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:20,873
No. It gets way worse.

914
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:22,680
Bye!

915
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:26,433
- Worse?
- Dude said' ”Way worse."

916
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:31,231
Prepare the prisoners.

917
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:32,640
That couldn't be for us.

918
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:35,678
It's your big moment to fry.
I mean, shine.

919
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:38,752
It is for us, Patrick!
We're gonna die!

920
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:45,239
And that's how
I got SpongeBob out of Bikini Bottom.

921
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:47,960
- That's monstrous!
- Wait, that sounds good.

922
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:50,953
-Oh, brother,
-What do you expect? I'm evil.

923
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:52,519
Let's just focus on the plan.

924
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:56,833
We're approaching
The Lost City of Atlantic City.

925
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:59,232
Make way there, make way!

926
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:09,795
”Sponge and Star
Execution Extravaganza"?

927
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:11,632
No time to lose!

928
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:19,480
Ladies and gentlefish,
welcome to the Aqua Room, y'all.

929
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:22,279
The greatest show underwater.

930
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:25,273
My groupies and groupers...

931
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:28,512
- We love you, Tiffany!
- Yeah, holler at your girl!

932
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:30,193
Are you ready to be entertained?

933
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:35,153
I can't hear you.
Are you ready to be entertained?

934
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:39,758
All right, then,
let's meet the contestants.

935
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:43,151
In this corner, a sponge and a star.

936
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:45,834
Two of the ocean's
most notorious criminals!

937
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:52,280
And in this corner,
representing His Majesty the King,

938
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:56,433
Poseidon's very own chancellor!

939
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:59,750
Now drum roll, maestro.

940
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:03,470
Put your fins together
for the duke of the dirty deed,

941
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:07,952
the earl of execution,
that axe-wielding maniac.

942
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:10,316
Yeah, Lemont!

943
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:15,511
Lemont!

944
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:17,959
I love me some Lemont.

945
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:20,120
He's so strong.

946
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:30,356
Ladies and gentlemen,
with a moment of smooth jazz

947
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:35,435
in memory of the soon-to-be-goners,
I give you Kelpy G.

948
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:49,910
Patrick, I feel terrible.
I dragged you into this whole mess.

949
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:54,915
It's okay, SpongeBob. I made
a plea deal with the prosecution!

950
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:58,711
That's good. Wait, you did what?

951
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:01,030
All I have to do is... Yeah!

952
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:04,272
"Bring incriminating evidence
against the defendant."

953
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:07,112
Patrick, I'm the defendant.

954
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:08,200
You are?

955
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:22,314
Let the proceedings begin!

956
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:26,231
Your Honor, I would like
to enter into evidence,

957
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:29,950
one sea snail. Name: Fred.

958
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:32,755
Gary!

959
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:36,999
How dare you!
That's about all I can say.

960
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:39,276
How dare you come here,

961
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:43,194
to the sanctuary
of our revered sovereign,

962
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:48,992
to rob him of his very lifeblood,
his adorable good looks.

963
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:51,275
Go on.

964
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:54,637
How indeed dare you?

965
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:57,760
Guilty!

966
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:02,198
Lemont!

967
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:12,553
Hold it!

968
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:15,669
If it please the court,

969
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:17,910
I'd like to say something
in SpongeBob's defense.

970
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,434
It does not please the court.

971
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:22,194
Sit down,
squirrel with fishbowl on head!

972
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:26,353
But, sire, a strong defense
makes for a better show.

973
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:27,839
Isn't that right, audience?

974
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:34,791
All right! I'll allow it.

975
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:36,473
Thank you, Your Honor.

976
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:41,671
Ladies and gentlemen, SpongeBob has
always been there for me.

977
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:44,036
Even going
all the way back to summer camp.

978
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:47,150
In fact, that's where we all met.

979
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:03,119
I'm...

980
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:12,315
ready!

981
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:19,910
Look at all the cool activities!

982
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:23,755
Camping, canoeing,
seahorse-back riding,

983
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:26,480
tug of war, whale watching!

984
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:27,595
Do you mind?

985
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:32,390
Juggling contests,
shrink-wrap soccer, and more!

986
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:41,873
Hey, y'all critters
of the sea! Look out below!

987
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:46,798
I'm Sandy Cheeks from Texas.

988
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:48,632
Hi, Sandy. I'm SpongeBob.

989
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:50,199
Pleased to meet ya.

990
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:52,840
Does everybody wear spacesuits
in Texas?

991
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:55,673
They do if they wanna
visit you underwater critters.

992
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:58,070
We all breathe air on the surface.

993
01:01:58,160 --> 01:01:59,958
It's just our way
of synthesizing oxygen.

994
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:02,077
Same as you do with water.

995
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:05,717
Are you a scientist?

996
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:08,394
Naw, I'm just a squirrel.

997
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:12,633
I can't be a scientist.
Even though it's kinda my dream.

998
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:17,032
Sandy Cheeks, you take that back!
I bet you can do anything.

999
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:18,120
Really?

1000
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:21,960
<i>Me a scientist?</i>

1001
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:26,640
<i>Science.</i>

1002
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:31,633
You're a hoot, little dude.

1003
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:33,677
I'd be just as likely
to live down here

1004
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:35,910
in a glass dome with a tree in it.

1005
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:38,189
You never know!

1006
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:53,197
He's the one that told me,
no matter who I was,

1007
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:57,353
or where I came from,
I should follow my dream.

1008
01:02:57,880 --> 01:02:59,598
That's a friend, people.

1009
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:02,152
And that's why, in my eyes...

1010
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:04,872
SpongeBob is no criminal.

1011
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:10,356
He's the best little fella to ever
walk the sea bottom. And that's...

1012
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,355
That's just how I feel about it. So...

1013
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:16,077
Please, don't hurt him.

1014
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:22,476
This man broke the law!

1015
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:28,553
The law of: ”You should stay home

1016
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:31,598
"and accept the fact
that somebody stole your snail."

1017
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:36,919
The law of: "There's probably
nothing I can do about it".

1018
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:40,598
Well, in this sea star's opinion,

1019
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:45,834
those laws should be broken
and SpongeBob is proof of it!

1020
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:50,513
All he's guilty of
is having the fortitude

1021
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:53,114
to try and rescue a friend.

1022
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:56,480
How do I know?

1023
01:03:57,280 --> 01:04:01,513
I was just a lonely bump on a log
when I first met him.

1024
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:10,275
Hi, my name...

1025
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:14,760
Hi, my name...

1026
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:18,750
Hello, my name is SpongeBob,
what's your name?

1027
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:22,638
I'm Pa-Pa-Patrick.

1028
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:27,199
Why are you crying, Pa-Pa-Patrick?

1029
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:29,430
I'm homesick.

1030
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:33,392
Well, that's a pretty good reason.

1031
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:35,833
Maybe all you need is a friend.

1032
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:40,393
I don't have any friends!

1033
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:42,830
- Well, you've got one now.
- Really?

1034
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:45,990
- Who is it?
- It's me!

1035
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:49,357
- Do you mean it?
- Of course. Come on!

1036
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:53,953
<i>That sweet little sponge</i>

1037
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:57,990
rescued this miserable
little sea star.

1038
01:04:58,120 --> 01:05:01,590
And things haven't changed
that much today, Your Honor.

1039
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:10,039
My heart, buddy.

1040
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:20,751
I don't like SpongeBob.
In fact, I revile him.

1041
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:29,158
Anyway, I, too,
met this nabob in summer camp.

1042
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:32,030
I remember it like it was yesterday.

1043
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:36,830
<i>It was my big night.
The Annual Camp Coral Talent Show.</i>

1044
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:43,118
<i>And first prize
was the coveted Campy Award.</i>

1045
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:44,554
Thank you, Larry.

1046
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:46,597
Remember, people,
don't forget to vote.

1047
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:56,393
<i>As far as I was concerned,
the trophy was as good as mine.</i>

1048
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:57,629
Hey, Squidward...

1049
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:01,320
Quiet. I'm in pregame right now.

1050
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:05,118
I've got an award to win.

1051
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:17,593
<i>Aka Waka Maka Mia
Was a puffer fish.</i>

1052
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:21,592
The Campy is mine.

1053
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:28,799
<i>I bathed the audience</i>

1054
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:31,958
<i>with the sounds
of my heavenly clarinet playing.</i>

1055
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:46,910
Thank you, Squidward. Just lovely.

1056
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,274
Thank you.

1057
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:53,869
And the Campy goes to...

1058
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:54,960
I'll take that.

1059
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:56,872
...SpongeBob and Patrick!

1060
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:01,313
No!

1061
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:06,679
This isn't happening! No! Mommy!

1062
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:12,358
<i>I was robbed.
And never to play the clarinet again.</i>

1063
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:17,559
No.

1064
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:27,029
- Squidward!
- Go away!

1065
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:30,953
Patrick and I were

1066
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:33,759
talking to one of the counselors
and guess what?

1067
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:37,549
There was a big mistake
and you actually won the Campy Award!

1068
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:39,039
That's right. Yup.

1069
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:42,952
- I did?
- In a landslide.

1070
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:47,315
So weird
they would've miscounted like that.

1071
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:49,311
But I guess it's possible...

1072
01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:53,351
- Nice work, Squidward.
- No one deserves it more.

1073
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:57,238
And don't ever stop playing this.

1074
01:07:57,320 --> 01:08:01,314
My clarinet.
Look at me. I really did it!

1075
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:08,591
Which is why, even though
I can't stand SpongeBob,

1076
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:11,149
but at the same time, well...

1077
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:12,760
I love him.

1078
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:15,036
I love him and I hate him.

1079
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:21,079
He's like ice cream with salt on it,
because he's sweet and super annoying.

1080
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:25,114
He's nice
and nails-on-chalkboard annoying!

1081
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:28,113
Okay, fine,
he's mostly super freaking annoying.

1082
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:31,955
But this little nattering noodge...

1083
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:33,720
...is my friend.

1084
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:36,473
And he doesn't deserve to die.

1085
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:47,632
I'll be saying my piece now,
if it be pleasing the court.

1086
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:51,393
I suppose I could stand up here

1087
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:53,830
and tell you
how SpongeBob changed me life.

1088
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:55,914
But I won't.

1089
01:08:56,920 --> 01:08:59,150
I might even speak
about how he inspired me

1090
01:08:59,280 --> 01:09:02,989
when I was just a small-time vendor
with a broken-down luncheonette.

1091
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:05,990
But, I won't.

1092
01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:07,160
Heck, I'd probably mention

1093
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:10,431
how he encouraged me
to start me own restaurant.

1094
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:13,080
You should open up
your own restaurant, someday.

1095
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:17,119
The Krusty Krab, made famous
by me delicious Krabby Patties!

1096
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:19,555
Two-for-one Wednesdays, by the way.
Pass these around.

1097
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:22,075
But, I won't.

1098
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:25,437
Nay, you'll hear
none such praise from me.

1099
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:28,276
Because it wouldn't do him
full justice.

1100
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:32,550
It wouldn't begin to describe
the size of the lad's heart.

1101
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:35,837
Which is huge.

1102
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:43,430
And he puts that heart
into everything he does.

1103
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:45,513
- The cooking...
- Order up!

1104
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:46,600
<i>...cleaning...</i>

1105
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:49,151
<i>..., serving up
the delicious Krabby Patties.</i>

1106
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:51,199
But that's the funny thing.

1107
01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:54,680
I used to think
me secret Krabby Party formula...

1108
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:57,318
...was also the secret to me success.

1109
01:09:57,880 --> 01:10:00,349
We serve breakfast till 11:00,
by the way, 12:00 on weekends.

1110
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:04,517
It wasn't until SpongeBob
came to work for me,

1111
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:09,515
that I realized the formula is more
than just a list of ingredients

1112
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:11,392
and flavor-capturing methods.

1113
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:14,757
It's more than
a jealously guarded recipe.

1114
01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:17,517
The real secret formula...

1115
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:20,597
...is sitting right here.

1116
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:24,270
SpongeBob SquarePants.

1117
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:29,830
Get ready.

1118
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:31,560
Maestro?

1119
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:42,158
<i>A formula is something like a recipe.</i>

1120
01:10:42,240 --> 01:10:45,039
<i>A recipe is something like a plan.</i>

1121
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:47,270
<i>With elements and measurements.</i>

1122
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:50,512
<i>All mixed together by a steady hand.</i>

1123
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:55,232
<i>But careful you must be
Or you'll be sad you see.</i>

1124
01:10:55,320 --> 01:10:58,517
<i>If somehow in the mix, it has no soul.</i>

1125
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:00,477
<i>So what's the one ingredient.</i>

1126
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:03,200
<i>That turns this awesome sauce
To liquid gold?</i>

1127
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:04,594
<i>I'll tell ya!</i>

1128
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:10,480
<i>The secret to the formula is you, you.</i>

1129
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:11,675
<i>You, you.</i>

1130
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:16,914
<i>The honey in my tea,
you know is you, you.</i>

1131
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:18,519
<i>You, you.</i>

1132
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:21,194
<i>The bubbles in the boil.</i>

1133
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:23,396
<i>The one essential oil.</i>

1134
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:25,073
<i>It's true.</i>

1135
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:29,711
<i>The secret to the formula is you, you.</i>

1136
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:30,800
<i>SpongeBob!</i>

1137
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:31,880
<i>You, you.</i>

1138
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:34,679
<i>What in the wide watery world.</i>

1139
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:40,073
<i>Would it be like without you?</i>

1140
01:11:40,160 --> 01:11:44,996
<i>The secret to the formula is you, you.</i>

1141
01:11:45,080 --> 01:11:46,400
<i>You, you.</i>

1142
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:51,998
<i>The honey in my tea,
you know is you, you.</i>

1143
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:53,309
<i>You, you.</i>

1144
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:55,960
<i>The bubbles in the boil.</i>

1145
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:59,869
<i>The one essential oil, it's true.</i>

1146
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:04,437
<i>The secret to the formula is you, you.</i>

1147
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:05,520
<i>SpongeBob!</i>

1148
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:06,795
<i>You, you.</i>

1149
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:11,158
<i>The secret to the formula is you, you.</i>

1150
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:13,390
- SpongeBob!
- So entertaining!

1151
01:12:13,480 --> 01:12:18,190
<i>The secret to the formula is you, you.</i>

1152
01:12:18,280 --> 01:12:19,953
<i>You, you.</i>

1153
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:24,953
Hilarious!

1154
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:29,913
My snail!

1155
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:36,877
Halt! It's a trick! Seize them!

1156
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:50,156
Gary, you're with me now.
I'll never let anyone take you again.

1157
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:52,155
Faster!

1158
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:00,429
- Patrick, what are you doing?
- Free food!

1159
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:04,200
Get him!

1160
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:12,552
Come on. In here!

1161
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:14,472
Stop right there!

1162
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,229
Inside! Quick!

1163
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:26,315
Come on!

1164
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:31,194
Push! Push, Plankton!

1165
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:32,953
You got to be kidding me!

1166
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:02,194
Peekaboo!

1167
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:03,870
Attack!

1168
01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:10,309
Attack!

1169
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:13,994
Watch your left flank, people!

1170
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:17,994
Thrust! Now parry!
Now pirouette. Turn around. Pivot!

1171
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:21,632
Pull harder. Faster! To the right!

1172
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:48,994
Do you think we should've stayed
in there with Squidward?

1173
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:50,912
Nah, he's got it.

1174
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:52,752
Where is everybody?

1175
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:54,154
Charge!

1176
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:06,270
- Squidward!
- Squidward!

1177
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:15,120
Squidward! Fall this way!

1178
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:16,599
No, this way!

1179
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:22,760
Man down.

1180
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:26,198
Good catch.

1181
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:28,950
- Hey, there they are!
- Get them!

1182
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:32,080
- Yo, what's up?
- Otto!

1183
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:34,151
I have a gambling problem.

1184
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:39,555
- Otto!
- Could anyone lend me some money?

1185
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:42,550
To Bikini Bottom! And step on it!

1186
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:44,114
Stepping on it.

1187
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:46,239
You're all fired.

1188
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:48,634
To the valet!

1189
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:54,911
Leaving so soon, kids?

1190
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:58,436
Hang on, Gary.
I won't let you go.

1191
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:01,638
Tsk, tsk.
Rather impolite, don't you think?

1192
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:03,313
It was all their idea, sire.

1193
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:05,073
And I...

1194
01:16:06,240 --> 01:16:07,514
...loved it!

1195
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:09,477
Wait, so you're not mad at us?

1196
01:16:09,560 --> 01:16:10,789
No.

1197
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:14,589
It's been a while since I've enjoyed
such toe-tapping entertainment.

1198
01:16:14,680 --> 01:16:16,079
All is forgiven!

1199
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:18,117
And all charges are dropped.

1200
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:20,757
On one condition.

1201
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:26,315
SpongeBob will return my snail to me
without any more shilly-shally.

1202
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:27,799
Wait, what?

1203
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:30,872
Just hand over the snail
and you can all go free.

1204
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:36,353
But... I...

1205
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:37,874
<i>SpongeBob.</i>

1206
01:16:38,680 --> 01:16:40,637
<i>Sage? Is that you?</i>

1207
01:16:40,720 --> 01:16:41,869
Hello.

1208
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:43,598
<i>Sage! Hi!</i>

1209
01:16:43,680 --> 01:16:46,991
Remember.
The courage you seek is inside you.

1210
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:49,589
And it will come to you
in your hour of need.

1211
01:16:51,680 --> 01:16:53,910
<i>The courage is inside me.</i>

1212
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:58,076
The courage is inside me!

1213
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:03,400
Mr. Poseidon, no.
I'm sorry, but I won't do it.

1214
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:06,280
What?

1215
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:08,874
I love Gary too much and he loves me.

1216
01:17:09,480 --> 01:17:11,596
If we didn't have each other,
we'd be so sad,

1217
01:17:11,680 --> 01:17:14,479
well, it wouldn't really matter
what you'd do to us.

1218
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:19,589
And look, today,
thanks to these amazing friends,

1219
01:17:19,680 --> 01:17:22,991
my heart feels
twice as big as it ever did.

1220
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:26,076
Especially after
what they risked for me:

1221
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:29,352
Flouting the law and defying
the mighty king of the sea.

1222
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:32,192
Defying? Really?

1223
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:34,715
I wouldn't say defying the king.

1224
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:37,030
Humiliating you
in front of your subjects.

1225
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:39,270
- Do go on.
- More like admiring.

1226
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:42,557
- And totally agreeing with!
- I just came to see Kelpy G.

1227
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:44,551
And they did it all for me.

1228
01:17:44,680 --> 01:17:47,672
I'm sure you'd understand
if you had friends like these.

1229
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:49,398
Friends like these?

1230
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:52,999
Wait, what? Friends like these?

1231
01:17:54,280 --> 01:17:58,433
Of course I have friends like these.
I have all kinds of friends.

1232
01:17:58,520 --> 01:18:00,955
I have buddies, I have besties.

1233
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:04,396
I have home-slices, palsy-walsies.

1234
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:05,834
It's infinite!

1235
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:09,470
Chancellor, give us an exact number.
The friend count, if you will.

1236
01:18:10,200 --> 01:18:12,555
Okay, according
to your latest polling data...

1237
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:15,476
We should get more polling data.

1238
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:16,560
What? Give me that.

1239
01:18:18,280 --> 01:18:19,600
What about my adoring fans?

1240
01:18:21,160 --> 01:18:23,231
- Nope.
- My elite palace guards?

1241
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:25,594
What about my personal trainer?

1242
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:29,673
- My therapist?
- Nada.

1243
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:31,592
- My tattoo artist?
- Nope.

1244
01:18:31,680 --> 01:18:33,830
- My tattoo removal artist?
- No dice.

1245
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:39,632
But surely you,
my chancellor, my loyal faithful?

1246
01:18:39,720 --> 01:18:40,720
Sorry.

1247
01:18:50,040 --> 01:18:51,678
Apollo, take me now.

1248
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:56,758
I don't have any friends!

1249
01:18:59,320 --> 01:19:01,072
Well, you got one now.

1250
01:19:02,440 --> 01:19:04,875
Really? Who is it?

1251
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:06,871
It's me! I'll be your friend.

1252
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:09,035
Do you mean it?

1253
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:12,750
Yes. But friends don't kidnap
friends' pet snails.

1254
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:14,918
But I need that snail.

1255
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:18,231
Look, I have a horrible,
disgusting wrinkle.

1256
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:20,960
Jumping jellyfish,
it's the size of the Mariana Trench!

1257
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:24,710
Kidding! Looks don't matter.

1258
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:28,395
We don't care about little
imperfections or even big ones.

1259
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:30,756
-Just look at Squidward,
-What's that supposed to mean?

1260
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:32,717
What's important is what's inside.

1261
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:35,155
And I'm sure
you can be a fair and kind king

1262
01:19:35,240 --> 01:19:39,359
to all the creatures of the sea.
I know you've got it in you, sir.

1263
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:41,590
If you'd just let
your hair down a little.

1264
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:45,518
My hair? Wait a minute.

1265
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:49,719
Are you suggesting that I don't need
this gorgeous mane of wavy locks?

1266
01:19:52,280 --> 01:19:53,793
That I don't require this neck clip?

1267
01:19:58,760 --> 01:20:00,797
Be gone, perfect shiny teeth!

1268
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:03,671
This is so freeing!

1269
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:05,990
To heck with this chest plate
and girdle.

1270
01:20:08,640 --> 01:20:11,109
- Too far?
- No! Not at all!

1271
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:13,595
No, you look great!

1272
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:17,514
Thank you!
I find this so exhilarating.

1273
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:19,830
30 age appropriate.

1274
01:20:19,960 --> 01:20:25,080
SpongeBob, few possess the courage
to stand up to a powerful king.

1275
01:20:25,160 --> 01:20:29,313
You, sir, are among those few.
I salute you.

1276
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:31,277
Nailed it, SpongeBob.

1277
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:33,080
Sage out.

1278
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:35,799
You may keep Gary.

1279
01:20:35,880 --> 01:20:39,111
And I wish you
many happy years together.

1280
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:41,669
Thank you!
Did you hear that, Gare-Bear?

1281
01:20:43,160 --> 01:20:44,559
Your royal robe, Your Highness.

1282
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:47,439
- It's getting cold out here.
- Nonsense, Chancellor.

1283
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:48,919
I'm free!

1284
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:50,915
You certainly are.

1285
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,230
And free the snails!

1286
01:20:58,480 --> 01:20:59,595
What's that?

1287
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:03,994
All of 'em?

1288
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:12,799
I'm home!

1289
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:16,352
Hello, Gary.

1290
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:17,475
Hello, Brian.

1291
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:24,075
Hello, Janet. Hello, June.
<i>Hola,</i> Lupe.

1292
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:28,792
- Morning, Sally!
- Hi, Brett!

1293
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:43,759
Come on, Mom! Hurry!

1294
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:47,036
Come on, Gary! You can do it!

1295
01:21:50,040 --> 01:21:51,155
Yeah!

1296
01:21:57,360 --> 01:21:59,829
Fabio! Where are you, buddy?

1297
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:01,879
Here, Fabio.

1298
01:22:04,640 --> 01:22:07,519
Come on, Fifi. No.

1299
01:22:28,280 --> 01:22:29,280
Order up!
