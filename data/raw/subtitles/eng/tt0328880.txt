Well, he's actually the squirrel.
I'm more of a purebred wolverine.

344
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,219
Look at these cuspids. (GROWLS)

345
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:18,675
- TUKE: Give him a little room.
- (GROANS) Why am I talking to moose?

346
00:29:18,674 --> 00:29:21,223
- No, we're squirrels, eh.
- Wolverine.

347
00:29:22,344 --> 00:29:24,346
I'll find it myself.

348
00:29:25,264 --> 00:29:27,767
- Oh, I wouldn't go that way.
- Why not, eh?

349
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:30,860
Uh, well, there was a reason.

350
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:33,280
TUKE: You brought it up.
RUTT: I'm trying to...

- Well, no, but it's driving me nuts.

Ow. (GROANS)

357
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:03,051
Hey. Is the coast clear?

358
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:05,888
- What?
- Are there any hunters around?

359
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:08,398
- Uh... No.
- Oh, good!

360
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:11,226
- (SHOUTS)
- You didn't see the trap?

361
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:15,276
I saw it from a mile away.
You must be pretty embarrassed.

362
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:16,607
Don't worry.

363
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:20,072
(WHISPERS) I won't tell anyone.

364
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:22,663
- What?
- You need to get down. Let me help.

365
00:30:22,738 --> 00:30:24,331
Oh, wait. Ow!

366
00:30:24,406 --> 00:30:27,000
- Hold still.
- Just... Stop that. Ow!

367
00:30:27,701 --> 00:30:29,169
If you just...

368
00:30:29,578 --> 00:30:32,127
- Stop it!
- It's no use.

369
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:36,923
The only way to get down
is to chew your own foot off.

370
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:40,889
I don't need some stupid bear's help.
I just need the stick.

371
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:43,262
- Okay, here.
- No, I'll do it myself.

372
00:30:43,342 --> 00:30:45,936
Put it back. No, where you found it.

373
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:48,938
- Oh.
- To the left. By the little rock.

374
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:50,352
- Here?
- Yes.

375
00:30:50,432 --> 00:30:51,809
Okay.

376
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:55,608
Boy, that tree is strong, huh?

377
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:58,699
You know, when I was little,
I was really into climbing trees.

378
00:30:58,774 --> 00:31:00,026
All kinds of trees.

379
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:05,865
I climbed pine trees, oaks, cedars,
maples, birch trees, willow trees...

380
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:08,120
My eyes were watering
and my tongue was swollen.

381
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:11,791
From that moment on,
I was more careful about what I lick.

- That was funny. Do it again.

385
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:31,269
- Don't you have someplace to go?
- Yeah, the salmon run.

386
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:36,479
How about this?
I get you down, then we go together.

387
00:31:36,478 --> 00:31:39,482
- Deal?
- Yeah, okay, fine.

388
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:42,989
If you can magically get me down,
I'll go with you to this...

389
00:31:43,068 --> 00:31:46,117
- Salmon run.
- Whatever. But if you can't...

390
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:50,501
You turn around, walk away,
and never come back, ever.

391

- You swear?
- Yeah.

392
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:55,339
- Pinky swear?
- Yeah, sure, fine, pinky swear.

393
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:58,338
But this is a human trap
and you're just a dumb little bear.

There's no way
you're going to be able...

we travel by day and sleep by night.

touch the mountain. Last year...

- Lots of bears and fish.

No. You know
where the lights touch the earth?

right by the salmon run.

- Rutt.
- You're breaking my concentration.

00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:09,538
We should start running, like now!

477
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:14,047
I can't. I'm still digesting, eh.
I'll get cramps.

- You think so?

- And, uh, smallish bear.

519
00:40:55,203 --> 00:40:57,581
I didn't know you had a little brother.
He's cute.

520
00:40:57,664 --> 00:41:01,589
- Actually, he's...
- There was this hunter following us.

521
00:41:01,668 --> 00:41:04,922
We was thinking if we could
maybe just hang out with you guys.

522
00:41:04,921 --> 00:41:07,549
- Just hang out.
- Yeah, it'd be fun.

523
00:41:07,632 --> 00:41:10,886
- If the hunter was going to catch up...
- Then you'd eat him.

524
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:14,564
- That's what we was thinking.
- We lost the hunter at the glacier.

525

You don't think he'll follow those?

526
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:21,321
- They are quite nice.
- I've got an idea.

RUTT: Beauty, eh?

544
00:42:23,458 --> 00:42:27,133
Okay, here's how I remember it.
The snow is white, it's all right.

545
00:42:27,128 --> 00:42:29,631
Yellow or green, it's just not clean.

546
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,303
I learned that one the hard way.

547
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:35,978
That reminds me. Last year at the
salmon run my friend Bucky dared me.

548
00:42:36,054 --> 00:42:39,183
But I'd heard of a cub
who stuck his tongue to an iceberg.

549
00:42:39,182 --> 00:42:41,150
Then he started to float away.

550
00:42:41,142 --> 00:42:44,021
To save him
they had to rip off his tongue,

551
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:46,990
so now he hath to talk like thith
all the time and...

552
00:42:47,065 --> 00:42:49,909
- Do you ever stop talking?
- Oh!

Look. The night rainbow.

- You can see the spirits from here.
- You know about the great spirits?

00:42:56,741 --> 00:42:59,995
Yeah, my grandma's up there,
and my granddad.

556
00:43:01,162 --> 00:43:04,757
Mom says the spirits make
all the magical changes in the world.

557
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:08,712
Like how the leaves change colour,
or the moon changes shapes,

558
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:12,386
- or tadpoles change into frogs.
- Yeah, I get it.

559
00:43:12,465 --> 00:43:17,062
You know, for a change, maybe
they could just leave things alone.

560
00:43:17,053 --> 00:43:20,057
- What do you mean?
- My brother's a spirit.

561

If it wasn't for him, I...

562
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:25,019
I wouldn't be here.

- What happened to him?
- He was killed by a...

- Tree.
- Okay.

- A vertical log.
- Tree.

- Tree.

into a homing pigeon?

you and Binky found

First of all, his name's Bucky, not Binky.

601
00:46:04,095 --> 00:46:06,564
Second, it wasn't a pine cone,
it was a pine nut.

602
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:09,688
And it was huge.
Even bigger than your fat head.

Oh, gee,
our big guardian bear is leaving, eh?

Yeah. We'd better follow him. Come on.

- I can't get off.

Me, neither. Okay, you guys...

with those guys later, eh?

might be a good time for me to drive.

610
00:46:31,872 --> 00:46:34,421
Just relax and enjoy the ride.

611
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,218

00:46:37,169 --> 00:46:38,546

I have a fat head?

Well, if you hunched your shoulders
a little it wouldn't seem so big.

give us directions.

Yeah. The salmon run's not far.

and then there's surprised.

01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:51,526
Me and Mom were eating fish,
having a great time.

848
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:56,573
All of a sudden she pushes me into
the bushes and tells me to be real quiet.

849
01:02:56,940 --> 01:03:00,490
She says, "I smell something."
So I started sniffing.

850
01:03:01,528 --> 01:03:04,202
There's something in the woods
running towards us,

851
01:03:04,281 --> 01:03:06,784
getting closer and closer.

853
01:03:08,535 --> 01:03:12,585
And then, out of the trees,
jumps a hunter.

(ALL GASP)

855
01:03:14,416 --> 01:03:17,386
And now there's nowhere for Mom to go.

856
01:03:17,377 --> 01:03:21,132
The monster has her backed up
against this giant glacier.

857
01:03:25,552 --> 01:03:29,273
The monster attacks,
but Mom's too quick for him.

858
01:03:29,264 --> 01:03:34,862
And before he can do it again, she
stands up real big and yells, "Go away."

- (SHOUTING)
- SITKA: <i>Kenai.</i>

860
01:03:36,896 --> 01:03:38,648
Mom smells more of them.

861
01:03:38,732 --> 01:03:40,734
There's a whole pack
coming right at us.

862
01:03:41,234 --> 01:03:43,236
Sitka, no. The bear. Behind you.

863
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:45,664
<i>She runs to stop them</i>
<i>before they get to me.</i>

864
01:03:45,739 --> 01:03:48,788
<i>They're all around her,</i>
<i>poking her with sticks.</i>

865
01:03:48,867 --> 01:03:52,667
- KENAI: Sitka.
<i>- The whole thing broke and fell off.</i>

866
01:03:52,746 --> 01:03:54,589
<i>There was ice everywhere.</i>

867
01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:57,417
<i>She couldn't hold her breath</i>
<i>any longer, and pow.</i>

868
01:03:57,417 --> 01:04:01,422
She bursts out of the water.
I've never been so scared in my life.

869
01:04:01,713 --> 01:04:04,637
- KENAI: <i>I'm going after the bear.</i>
- Koda?

870

DENAHI: <i>Sitka wouldn't want it.</i>
KENAI: <i>Sitka's not here</i>

871
01:04:06,634 --> 01:04:08,728
<i>because of that monster.</i>

872
01:04:10,889 --> 01:04:14,484
Whoa. Fell off a glacier?
I've never seen anything like that.

- Can you imagine?
- (WHIMPERING)

874
01:04:17,270 --> 01:04:19,944
Kenai. What's the matter, Kenai?

FEMALE: What happened next?
FEMALE 2: Was she okay?

876
01:04:23,777 --> 01:04:27,156
Hey, Kenai, what's wrong?
Where you going?

877
01:04:27,238 --> 01:04:30,492
She got out of the water okay.
That's how we got separated.

878
01:04:30,492 --> 01:04:33,496
Right after that I met Kenai.

879
01:04:33,495 --> 01:04:34,667

01:05:25,171 --> 01:05:26,844
- You look horrible.
- Koda...

884
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:29,844
My mom says when
you eat too much fish, just lie down.

885
01:05:32,262 --> 01:05:34,264
There's something I, uh...

886
01:05:35,265 --> 01:05:37,438
You know that story
you told me last night?

887
01:05:37,517 --> 01:05:40,862
- Yeah.
- Well, I have a story to tell you.

888
01:05:40,854 --> 01:05:43,232
Really? What's it about?

889
01:05:43,231 --> 01:05:46,405
Well, it's kind of about a man,

890
01:05:46,484 --> 01:05:49,078
and kind of about a bear.

891
01:05:49,154 --> 01:05:52,203
But mostly it's about a monster.

892
01:05:53,533 --> 01:05:55,535
A monster who did something so bad...

893

<i>I'd do anything within my power</i>

896
01:06:11,676 --> 01:06:14,805
<i>I'd give everything I've got</i>

897
01:06:14,888 --> 01:06:19,485
<i>But the path I seek</i>
<i>is hidden from me now</i>

898
01:06:19,559 --> 01:06:22,779

01:18:24,950 --> 01:18:29,000
Listen to me. I was a man
that was changed into a bear.

1019
01:18:29,079 --> 01:18:32,504
No beaver. Man into bear. That's it.

1020
01:18:32,583 --> 01:18:36,679
Oh. Yeah, so, before that
you was probably like a goat?

1021
01:18:36,670 --> 01:18:39,014
- What about a water buffalo?
- No, he's a rabbit.

1022
01:18:39,006 --> 01:18:42,510
Look at his ears and furry feet.
Watch out for the rabbit, eh.

1023
01:18:42,509 --> 01:18:43,852
No way, eh.

1024
01:18:43,844 --> 01:18:47,690
Okay, now, everyone,
take a big inhale, eh?

1025
01:18:47,765 --> 01:18:49,233
And then on...

1026
01:18:49,308 --> 01:18:53,529
On the exhale,
shift into salutation to the sun.

1027
01:18:53,771 --> 01:18:55,489
(ALL GROANING)

1028

(LAUGHS)

1031
01:19:10,788 --> 01:19:14,008
- How you doing over there, Koda?
- Oh, pretty good.

1032
01:19:16,627 --> 01:19:20,177
(BOTH LAUGHING, GROWLING)

(CLEARS THROAT)

1034
01:24:29,064 --> 01:24:32,534
In accordance with all federal
and state wildlife regulations,

1035
01:24:32,609 --> 01:24:35,328
no fish were harmed
during the making of this film.

1037
01:24:37,364 --> 01:24:40,413
- No! He's gonna eat me!
- (ROARS)

1038
01:24:41,076 --> 01:24:43,374
(NERVOUS LAUGH) Cut. Cut.

1039
01:24:43,954 --> 01:24:46,207
Somebody, help me.
Help me. Somebody.

1040
01:24:46,290 --> 01:24:48,088

- Ooh!
