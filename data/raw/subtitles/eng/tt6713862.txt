1
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:24,740
Samadhi

2
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:30,640
is an ancient Sanskrit word, for which there
is no modern equivalent.

3
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:38,210
There is a fundamental challenge with making
a film about Samadhi.

4
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:54,230
Samadhi points to something that can’t be
conveyed on the level of mind.

5
00:01:54,230 --> 00:02:00,240
This film is simply the outer manifestation
of my own inner journey.

6
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:06,950
The intention is not to teach you about Samadhi,
or provide information for your mind, but

7
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:17,260
to inspire you to directly discover your true
nature.

8
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:29,200
Samadhi is relevant now more than ever.

9
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:34,840
We are at a time in history where we have
not only forgotten Samadhi, but we have forgotten

10
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:43,700
what we forgot.

11
00:02:43,700 --> 00:03:28,129
This forgetting is Maya, the illusion of the
self.

12
00:03:28,129 --> 00:03:34,239
As humans most of us live immersed in our
daily lives, with little thought of who we

13
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:42,439
are, why we are here, or where we’re going.

14
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:49,680
Most of us have never realized the true self,
the soul or what the Buddha called annata

15
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:56,980
- that which is beyond name and form, beyond
thinking.

16
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:01,520
As a result we believe we are these limited
bodies.

17
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:10,870
We live in fear, either conscious or unconscious,
that the limited self structure that we are

18
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:25,630
identified with, will die.

19
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:30,890
In today's world the vast majority of people
who are engaged in religious or spiritual

20
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:39,750
practices such as yoga, prayer, meditation,
chanting or any kind of ritual, are practicing

21
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,340
techniques which are conditioned.

22
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:49,530
Which means they are just part of the ego
construct.

23
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:55,479
The seeking and the activity isn’t the problem-
thinking you have found the answer in some

24
00:04:55,479 --> 00:05:01,260
external form is the problem.

25
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:07,350
Spirituality in its most common form is no
different than the pathological thinking that

26
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:10,680
is going on everywhere.

27
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,050
It is a further agitation of the mind.

28
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:19,480
More human doing, as opposed to human being.

29
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:28,840
The ego construct wants more money, more power,
more love, more of everything.

30
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:37,610
Those on the so-called spiritual path desire
to be more spiritual, more awake, more equanimous,

31
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:43,380
more peaceful, more enlightened.

32
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:53,141
The danger for you watching this film is that
your mind will want to acquire Samadhi . Even

33
00:05:53,141 --> 00:06:01,130
more dangerous is that your mind might think
it has acquired Samadhi.

34
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:06,270
Whenever there is a desire to attain something
you can be sure that it is the ego construct

35
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:08,120
at work.

36
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:17,850
Samadhi is not about attaining or adding anything
to yourself.

37
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:26,830
To realize Samadhi is to learn to die before
you die.

38
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:32,360
Life and death are like yin and yang- an inseparable
continuum.

39
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:37,440
Endlessly unfolding, with no beginning and
no end.

40
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:42,630
When we push away death, we also push away
life.

41
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:48,820
When you experience the truth directly of
who you are, there is no longer fear of life

42
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:51,030
or death.

43
00:06:51,030 --> 00:07:00,160
We are told who we are by our society and
our culture, and at the same - time we are

44
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:12,719
slaves to the deeper unconscious biological
craving and aversion that governs our choices.

45
00:07:12,719 --> 00:07:16,360
The ego construct is nothing more than the
impulse to repeat.

46
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:22,880
It is simply the path that energy once took
and the tendency for the energy to take that

47
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:33,190
path again, whether it is positive or negative
for the organism.

48
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:39,760
There are endless levels of memory or mind,
spirals within spirals.

49
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:46,530
When your consciousness identifies with this
mind or ego construct, it ties you to social

50
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:54,750
conditioning, which you could call the matrix.

51
00:07:54,750 --> 00:08:00,940
There are aspects of the ego that we can be
conscious of, but it is the unconscious, the

52
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:13,370
archaic wiring, the primal existential fears,
that are actually driving the whole machine.

53
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:18,649
Endless patterns of grasping towards pleasure
and avoidance of pain are sublimated into

54
00:08:18,649 --> 00:08:31,089
pathological behaviours .... our work....
our relationships.... our beliefs, our very

55
00:08:31,089 --> 00:08:37,150
thoughts, and our whole way of living.

56
00:08:37,150 --> 00:09:08,120
Like cattle, most humans live and die in passive
subjugation, feeding their lives to the matrix.

57
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:12,200
We live lives locked into narrow patterns.

58
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:17,460
Lives often filled with great suffering, and
it never occurs to us that we can actually

59
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:25,990
become free.

60
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:34,300
It is possible to let go of the life that
has been inherited from the past, to live

61
00:09:34,300 --> 00:10:08,300
the one that is waiting to come forth through
the inner world.

62
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:20,800
We were all born into this world with biological
conditioned structures, but without self awareness.

63
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:29,280
Often when you look into a young child's eyes
there is no trace of self, only luminous emptiness.

64
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:36,510
The person one grows into is a mask worn over
consciousness.

65
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:54,260
Shakespeare said, "All the world's a stage,
and all the men and women merely players".

66
00:10:54,260 --> 00:11:04,290
In an awakened individual, consciousness shines
through the personality, through the mask.

67
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:08,960
When you are awake, you don't become identified
with your character.

68
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:17,030
You don't believe that you are the masks that
you are wearing.

69
00:11:17,030 --> 00:12:12,779
But nor do you give up playing a role.

70
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:19,050
Twenty-four hundred years after Plato wrote
the Republic, humanity is still making its

71
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:25,430
way out of Plato's cave.

72
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:36,680
In fact we may be more transfixed by illusions
than ever.

73
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:42,600
Plato had Socrates describe a group of people
who lived chained in a cave all of their lives,

74
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,220
facing a blank wall.

75
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:50,480
All they could see were shadows projected
on the wall by the things passing in front

76
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,440
of a fire which was behind them.

77
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,960
This puppet show becomes their world.

78
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:06,560
According to Socrates, the shadows were as
close as the prisoners would ever get to seeing

79
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:11,100
reality.

80
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:16,370
Even after being told about the outside world
they continued to believe that the shadows

81
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:19,430
were all that is.

82
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:24,400
Even if they suspected there was something
more they were unwilling to leave what was

83
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:36,000
familiar.

84
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,800
Humanity today is like the people who have
only seen the shadows on the cave wall.

85
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,260
The shadows are analogous to our thoughts.

86
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:47,779
The world of thinking is the only world that
we know.

87
00:13:47,779 --> 00:13:52,150
But there is another world that is beyond
thinking.

88
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:55,029
Beyond the dualistic mind.

89
00:13:55,029 --> 00:14:03,380
Are you willing to leave the cave, to leave
all that you have known to find out the truth

90
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:16,390
of who you are?

91
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:22,371
In order to experience Samadhi it is necessary
to turn attention away from the shadows, away

92
00:14:22,371 --> 00:14:25,900
from the thoughts towards the light.

93
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:40,640
When a person is only used to darkness then
they must gradually become accustomed to the

94
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:49,330
light.

95
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:55,240
Like acclimatizing to any new paradigm it
takes time and effort, and a willingness to

96
00:14:55,240 --> 00:15:16,680
explore the new, as well as shed the old.

97
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:30,330
The mind can be likened to a trap for consciousness,
a labyrinth or a prison.

98
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:39,779
It is not that you are in prison, you are
the prison.

99
00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:48,270
The prison is an illusion.

100
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:54,330
If you are identified with an illusory self,
then you are asleep.

101
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:59,340
Once you are aware of the prison, if you fight
to get out of the illusion, then you are treating

102
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:06,820
the illusion as if it is real and you still
remain asleep, except now the dream becomes

103
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:07,820
a nightmare.

104
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:19,440
You will be chasing and running from shadows
forever.

105
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:26,570
Samadhi is awakening from the dream of the
separate self or the egoic construct.

106
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:38,610
Samadhi is awakening from identification with
the prison that I call me.

107
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:47,690
You can never actually be free, because wherever
you go your prison is there.

108
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:53,601
Awakening is not about get rid of the mind
or the matrix, on the contrary; when you are

109
00:16:53,601 --> 00:16:58,860
not identified with it, then you can experience
the play of life more fully, enjoying the

110
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:03,700
show as it is, without craving or fear.

111
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:09,880
In the ancient teachings this was called the
divine game of Leila: the game of playing

112
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:22,039
in duality.

113
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:25,549
Human consciousness is a continuum.

114
00:17:25,549 --> 00:17:31,169
On one extreme, humans are identified with
the material self.

115
00:17:31,169 --> 00:17:37,559
On the other extreme is Samadhi, the cessation
of self.

116
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:46,470
Every step we take on the continuum towards
Samadhi, brings less suffering.

117
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:51,610
Less suffering does not mean life is free
from pain.

118
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:58,909
Samadhi is beyond the duality of pain and
pleasure.

119
00:17:58,909 --> 00:18:04,299
What it means is that there is less mind,
less self creating resistance to whatever

120
00:18:04,299 --> 00:18:22,309
unfolds and that resistance is what creates
suffering.

121
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:28,220
Realizing Samadhi even once allows you to
see what is at the other end of the continuum.

122
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:34,570
To see that there is something other than
the material world and self interest.

123
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:41,309
When there is an actual cessation of the self
structure in Samadhi there is no egoic thought,

124
00:18:41,309 --> 00:18:51,020
no self, no duality yet there is still the
I am, annata or no self.

125
00:18:51,020 --> 00:19:01,059
In that emptiness is the dawn of prajna or
wisdom- the understanding that the immanent

126
00:19:01,059 --> 00:19:10,820
self is far beyond the play of duality, beyond
the entire continuum.

127
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:18,440
The immanent self is timeless, unchanging,
always now.

128
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:24,509
Enlightenment is the merging of the primordial
spiral, the ever-changing manifested world

129
00:19:24,509 --> 00:19:34,269
or lotus in which time unfolds, with your
timeless being.

130
00:19:34,269 --> 00:19:41,700
Your inner wiring grows like an ever-unfolding
flower as you disidentify with the self, becoming

131
00:19:41,700 --> 00:20:09,580
a living bridge between the world of time
and the timeless.

132
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:14,539
Merely realizing the immanent self is only
the beginning of one’s path.

133
00:20:14,539 --> 00:20:20,530
Most people will have to experience and lose
Samadhi countless times in meditation before

134
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:24,629
they are able to integrate it into other facets
of life.

135
00:20:24,629 --> 00:20:32,220
It is not unusual to have profound insights
into the nature of your being during meditation

136
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:39,990
or self inquiry, only to find yourself once
again falling back into old patterns, forgetting

137
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:53,750
the truth of who you are.

138
00:20:53,750 --> 00:21:00,950
To realize that stillness or emptiness in
every facet of life, every facet of one’s

139
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:23,619
self, is to become emptiness dancing as all
things.

140
00:21:23,619 --> 00:21:27,600
Stillness is not something separate from movement.

141
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,799
It is not opposite to movement.

142
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:42,159
In Samadhi stillness is recognized to be identical
with movement, form is identical to emptiness.

143
00:21:42,159 --> 00:22:02,440
This is nonsensical to the mind because mind
is the coming into being of duality.

144
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:09,649
Rene Descartes, the father of western philosophy,
is famous for the saying “I think therefore

145
00:22:09,649 --> 00:22:11,139
I am”.

146
00:22:11,139 --> 00:22:18,340
No other phrase more clearly encapsulates
the fall of civilisation and the full scale

147
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:23,109
identification with the shadows on the cave
wall.

148
00:22:23,109 --> 00:22:32,460
Descartes’ error, like the error of almost
all humans, was the equating of fundamental

149
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:36,740
being with thinking.

150
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:51,309
At the beginning of his most famous treatise,
Descartes wrote that almost everything can

151
00:22:51,309 --> 00:23:03,340
be called into doubt; he can doubt his senses,
and even his thoughts.

152
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:09,991
Likewise in the Kalama Sutra the Buddha said
that in order to ascertain the truth, one

153
00:23:09,991 --> 00:23:17,320
must doubt all traditions, scriptures, teachings
and all of the content of one’s mind and

154
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,919
senses.

155
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:28,350
Both of these men started with great scepticism,
but the difference was that Descartes stopped

156
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:35,059
inquiring at the level of thinking, while
the Buddha went deeper- he penetrated beyond

157
00:23:35,059 --> 00:23:39,739
the deepest levels of the mind.

158
00:23:39,739 --> 00:23:46,859
Maybe if Descartes had gone beyond his thinking
mind, he would have realized his true nature

159
00:23:46,859 --> 00:23:52,970
and Western consciousness would be very different
today.

160
00:23:52,970 --> 00:24:00,889
Instead, Descartes described the possibility
of an evil demon that could be keeping us

161
00:24:00,889 --> 00:24:04,039
under a veil of illusion.

162
00:24:04,039 --> 00:24:10,940
Descartes did not recognize this evil demon
for what it was.

163
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:19,409
As in the movie the Matrix, we could all be
hooked up to some elaborate program feeding

164
00:24:19,409 --> 00:24:22,250
us an illusory dream world.

165
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:27,399
In the movie, humans lived out their lives
in the matrix, while on another level they

166
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:32,960
were merely batteries, feeding their life
force to the machines which used their energy

167
00:24:32,960 --> 00:25:06,720
for their own agenda.

168
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:11,399
People always want to blame something outside
of themselves for the state of the world or

169
00:25:11,399 --> 00:25:12,799
for their own unhappiness.

170
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:20,100
Whether it is a person, a particular group
or country, religion or some kind of controlling

171
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:27,999
Illuminati like Descartes’ evil demon, or
the sentient machines in the Matrix.

172
00:25:27,999 --> 00:25:35,139
Ironically, the demon that Descartes envisioned
was the very thing that he defined himself

173
00:25:35,139 --> 00:25:36,139
by.

174
00:25:36,139 --> 00:25:42,759
When you realize Samadhi, it becomes clear
that there is a controller, there is a machine,

175
00:25:42,759 --> 00:25:48,379
and evil demon leaching your life day after
day.

176
00:25:48,379 --> 00:26:01,250
The machine is you.

177
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:08,230
Your self structure is made up of many little
conditioned sub-programs or little bosses.

178
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:21,190
One little boss that craves food, another
craves money, another status, position, power,

179
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:25,679
sex, intimacy.

180
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:28,799
Another wants consciousness or attention from
others.

181
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:34,879
The desires are literally endless and can
never be satisfied.

182
00:26:34,879 --> 00:26:40,679
We spend a lot of our time and energy decorating
our prisons, succumbing to pressures to improve

183
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:47,019
our masks, and feeding the little bosses,
making them more powerful.

184
00:26:47,019 --> 00:26:56,710
Like drug addicts, the more we try to satisfy
the little bosses, the more we end up craving.

185
00:26:56,710 --> 00:27:04,729
The path to freedom is not self improvement,
or somehow satisfying the self’s agenda,

186
00:27:04,729 --> 00:27:12,999
but it’s a dropping of the self’s agenda
altogether.

187
00:27:12,999 --> 00:27:18,309
Some people fear that awakening their true
nature will mean that they lose their individuality

188
00:27:18,309 --> 00:27:20,429
and enjoyment of life.

189
00:27:20,429 --> 00:27:28,519
Actually, the opposite is true; the unique
individuation of the soul can only be expressed

190
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:36,240
when the conditioned self is overcome.

191
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:41,649
Because we remain asleep in the matrix most
of us never find out what the soul actually

192
00:27:41,649 --> 00:27:57,899
wants to express.

193
00:27:57,899 --> 00:28:05,479
The path to Samadhi involves meditation, which
is both observing the conditioned self; that

194
00:28:05,479 --> 00:28:14,429
which changes, and realizing your true nature;
that which does not change.

195
00:28:14,429 --> 00:28:22,450
When you come to your still point, the source
of your being, then you await further instructions

196
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:28,100
without any insistence on how your outer world
has to change.

197
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:38,429
Not my will, but higher will be done.

198
00:28:38,429 --> 00:28:43,649
If the mind only tries to change the outer
world to conform with some idea of what you

199
00:28:43,649 --> 00:28:49,299
think the path should be, it is like trying
to change the image in a mirror by manipulating

200
00:28:49,299 --> 00:28:51,940
the reflection.

201
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:58,330
To make the image in a mirror smile you obviously
can’t manipulate the reflection, you have

202
00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:05,590
to realize the you that is the authentic source
of the reflection.

203
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:11,229
Once you realize the authentic self, it doesn’t
mean that anything on the outside necessarily

204
00:29:11,229 --> 00:29:13,860
needs to change.

205
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:20,789
What changes is the conscious, intelligent,
inner energy or prana which is freed from

206
00:29:20,789 --> 00:29:30,019
conditioned patterns and becomes available
to be directed by the soul.

207
00:29:30,019 --> 00:29:35,210
You can only become aware of the soul’s
purpose when you are able to watch the conditioned

208
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:58,269
self and its endless pursuits, and let them
go.

209
00:29:58,269 --> 00:30:03,590
In Greek mythology, it was said that the gods
condemned Sisyphus to repeat a meaningless

210
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:06,529
task for all eternity.

211
00:30:06,529 --> 00:30:12,010
His task was to endlessly push a boulder up
a mountain, only to have it roll down again.

212
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:24,830
The

213
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:31,609
French existentialist and Nobel Prize winning
author, Albert Camus, saw the situation of

214
00:30:31,609 --> 00:30:35,399
Sisyphus as a metaphor for humanity.

215
00:30:35,399 --> 00:30:47,009
He asked the question, ‘How can we find
meaning in this absurd existence?’.

216
00:30:47,009 --> 00:30:55,389
As humans we are toiling endlessly, building
for a tomorrow that never arrives, and then

217
00:30:55,389 --> 00:31:09,289
we die.

218
00:31:09,289 --> 00:31:15,629
If we truly realize this truth then we will
either go mad if we are identified with our

219
00:31:15,629 --> 00:31:32,700
egoic personas, or we will awaken and become
free.

220
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:37,809
We can never succeed in the outer struggle,
because it is just a reflection of our inner

221
00:31:37,809 --> 00:31:39,789
world.

222
00:31:39,789 --> 00:31:45,759
The cosmic joke, the absurdity of the situation
becomes clear when there is a complete and

223
00:31:45,759 --> 00:32:15,090
utter failure of the egoic self to awaken
through its futile pursuits.

224
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:23,700
In Zen there is a saying, “Before enlightenment
chop wood, carry water.

225
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:35,019
After enlightenment chop wood, carry water”.

226
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:41,019
Before enlightenment one must roll the ball
up the hill, after enlightenment one must

227
00:32:41,019 --> 00:32:44,840
also roll the ball up the hill.

228
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:47,450
What has changed?

229
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:51,749
The inner resistance to what is.

230
00:32:51,749 --> 00:32:58,679
The struggle has been dropped, or rather the
one who struggles has been realized to be

231
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:00,929
illusory.

232
00:33:00,929 --> 00:33:14,649
The individual will or individual mind and
divine will, or higher mind, are aligned.

233
00:33:14,649 --> 00:33:27,690
Samadhi is ultimately a dropping of all inner
resistance - to all changing phenomena, without

234
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:28,879
exception.

235
00:33:28,879 --> 00:33:36,409
The one who is able to realize inner peace,
irrespective of circumstance has attained

236
00:33:36,409 --> 00:33:39,190
true Samadhi.

237
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:45,070
You drop resistance not because you condone
one thing or another, but so that your inner

238
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:50,179
freedom is not contingent on the outer.

239
00:33:50,179 --> 00:33:57,580
It’s important to note that when we accept
reality as it is, it doesn’t necessarily

240
00:33:57,580 --> 00:34:04,169
mean that we stop taking action in the world,
or we become meditating pacifists.

241
00:34:04,169 --> 00:34:10,330
Actually the opposite can be true; when we’re
free to act without being driven by unconscious

242
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:17,300
motives, then it is possible to act in alignment
with the Tao, with the full force of our inner

243
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:30,030
energy behind us.

244
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:35,810
Many will argue that in order to change the
world and bring about peace we need to fight

245
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:39,899
harder against our perceived enemies.

246
00:34:39,899 --> 00:34:48,659
Fighting for peace is like shouting for silence;
it just creates more of what you don’t want.

247
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:55,489
These days there is a war against everything:
a war against terror, a war against disease,

248
00:34:55,489 --> 00:35:00,540
a war against hunger.

249
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:13,369
Every war is actually a war against ourselves.

250
00:35:13,369 --> 00:35:17,150
The fight is part of a collective delusion.

251
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:23,400
We say that we want peace, but we continue
to elect leaders who engage in war.

252
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:29,400
We lie to ourselves saying that we are for
human rights, but continue to buy products

253
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,960
made in sweatshops.

254
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:36,309
We say we want clean air, but we continue
to pollute.

255
00:35:36,309 --> 00:35:42,660
We want science to cure us of cancer but won’t
change our self-destructive habitual behaviours

256
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:45,670
that make us more likely to be sick.

257
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:50,589
We delude ourselves that we are promoting
a better life.

258
00:35:50,589 --> 00:35:57,569
We don’t want to see our hidden parts that
are condoning suffering and death.

259
00:35:57,569 --> 00:36:06,690
The belief that we can win a war against cancer,
hunger, terror, or any enemy that was created

260
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:13,030
by our own thinking and behaviour, actually
lets us continue to delude ourselves that

261
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:18,589
we don’t have to change the way that we
operate on this planet.

262
00:36:18,589 --> 00:36:23,700
The inner world is where the revolution must
first take place.

263
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:30,589
Only when we can directly feel the spiral
of life within will the outer world come into

264
00:36:30,589 --> 00:36:33,950
alignment with the Tao.

265
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:41,990
Until then, anything we do will add to the
chaos already created by the mind.

266
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:49,369
War and peace arise together in an endless
dance; they are one continuum.

267
00:36:49,369 --> 00:36:53,029
One half cannot exist without the other.

268
00:36:53,029 --> 00:36:58,910
Just as light cannot exist without dark, and
up cannot exist without down.

269
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:07,079
The world seems to want light without darkness,
fullness without emptiness, happiness without

270
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:19,770
sadness.

271
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:38,339
The more the mind gets involved, the more
fragmented the world becomes.

272
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:44,430
Every solution that comes from the egoic mind
is driven by the idea that there is a problem,

273
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:52,950
and the solution becomes an even greater problem
than what it was trying to solve.

274
00:37:52,950 --> 00:38:07,540
What you resist persists.

275
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:14,819
Human ingenuity creates new antibiotics only
to find nature getting more cunning as bacteria

276
00:38:14,819 --> 00:38:16,839
gets stronger.

277
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:24,500
Despite our best efforts in the ongoing fight,
the prevalence of cancer is actually increasing,

278
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:32,740
the number of hungry people in the world steadily
grows, the number of terrorist attacks worldwide

279
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:36,270
continues to rise.

280
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:45,200
What’s wrong with our approach?

281
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:50,890
Like the Sorcerer’s Apprentice from Goethe’s
poem, we have taken hold of a great power,

282
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:56,109
but do not have the wisdom to wield it.

283
00:38:56,109 --> 00:39:03,230
The problem is that we do not understand the
tool that we are using.

284
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:18,010
We do not understand the human mind and its
proper role and purpose.

285
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:24,130
The crisis is born of the limited conditioned
way in which we think, the way we feel and

286
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:35,000
experience life.

287
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:41,510
Our rationalism has robbed us of our ability
to recognize and experience the wisdom of

288
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:48,059
many ancient cultures.

289
00:39:48,059 --> 00:39:54,670
Our egoic thinking has robbed us of the ability
to feel the depth and profound sacredness

290
00:39:54,670 --> 00:40:02,760
of life, the numinosity of life, and to realize
entirely different levels of consciousness,

291
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:11,289
which are now almost lost to humanity.

292
00:40:11,289 --> 00:40:17,529
In the ancient Egyptian tradition, Neters
were archetypal forms whose characteristics

293
00:40:17,529 --> 00:40:23,420
could be embodied by those who purified their
physical and spiritual bodies in such a way

294
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:27,630
that they were fit to house higher consciousnesses.

295
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:38,790
The original Neter, or the divine principle
of this wisdom was known as Thoth or Tehuti.

296
00:40:38,790 --> 00:40:44,750
Often depicted as a scribe with the head of
a bird or Ibis, and represented the origin

297
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:49,090
of all knowledge and wisdom.

298
00:40:49,090 --> 00:40:55,720
Thoth could be described as the cosmic principle
of thinking or thought.

299
00:40:55,720 --> 00:41:04,010
Thoth gave us language, concepts, writing,
mathematics, and all the arts and manifestations

300
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:05,940
of the mind.

301
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:15,170
Only those who had gone through special training
were allowed to access Thoth’s sacred knowledge.

302
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:26,030
The book of Thoth is not a physical book,
but is the wisdom of the akashic or etheric

303
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:27,319
realm.

304
00:41:27,319 --> 00:41:32,710
Legend tells that Thoth’s knowledge was
deeply hidden in a secret place within every

305
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:42,390
human being, and was protected by a golden
serpent.

306
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:48,579
The archetypal or perennial myth of the serpent
or dragon guarding a treasure is one that

307
00:41:48,579 --> 00:42:02,250
permeates many cultures and has been called
by names such as kundalini shakti, chi, holy

308
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:06,110
spirit, and inner energy.

309
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:12,779
The golden serpent is the egoic construct
which is bound in the inner energies and until

310
00:42:12,779 --> 00:42:19,450
it is mastered and overcome, the soul will
never be able to attain true wisdom.

311
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:24,869
It was said that the book of Thoth brought
nothing but suffering to any individual who

312
00:42:24,869 --> 00:42:32,380
read it, even though they would find the secrets
of the gods themselves and all that is hidden

313
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:34,869
within the stars.

314
00:42:34,869 --> 00:42:42,500
What must be understood is that the book brought
suffering to any individual who read it, any

315
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:45,420
ego that tried to control it.

316
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:53,859
In the Egyptian tradition awakened consciousness
was represented by Osiris.

317
00:42:53,859 --> 00:43:00,410
Without this awakened consciousness, any knowledge
or understanding obtained by the limited self

318
00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:08,240
would be dangerous, disconnected from higher
wisdom.

319
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:15,849
The eye of Horus had to be open.

320
00:43:15,849 --> 00:43:21,480
The esoteric meaning that we find here is
similar to the more familiar story of “the

321
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:23,710
fall” in the garden of Eden.

322
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:30,400
The book of Thoth parallels the book of knowledge
of good and evil whose fruit Adam and Eve

323
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:41,960
were tempted to eat.

324
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:49,200
Humanity of course has already eaten the forbidden
fruit, already opened the book of Thoth, and

325
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:54,910
has been cast out of the garden.

326
00:43:54,910 --> 00:44:01,980
The serpent is a metaphor for the primordial
spiral that extends from the microcosm to

327
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:06,730
the macrocosm.

328
00:44:06,730 --> 00:44:11,549
Today the serpent is living as you.

329
00:44:11,549 --> 00:44:18,800
It is the egoic mind expressed as the manifested
world.

330
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:22,589
We have never before had access to so much
knowledge.

331
00:44:22,589 --> 00:44:30,130
We have gone deep into the material world,
even finding the so-called God particle, but

332
00:44:30,130 --> 00:44:37,420
we have never been more limited, more ignorant
of who we are, how to live, and we do not

333
00:44:37,420 --> 00:45:28,430
understand the mechanism by which we create
suffering.

334
00:45:28,430 --> 00:45:32,230
Our thinking has created the world as it is
now.

335
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:37,529
Whenever we label something as good or bad,
or create preference in our mind it is due

336
00:45:37,529 --> 00:45:44,050
to the coming into being of egoic structures
or self interests.

337
00:45:44,050 --> 00:45:51,000
The solution is not to fight for peace or
conquer nature, but to simply recognize the

338
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:59,670
truth; that the very existence of the ego
structure creates duality, a split between

339
00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:10,730
self and other, mine and yours, man and nature,
inner and outer.

340
00:46:10,730 --> 00:46:19,660
The ego is violence; it requires a barrier,
a boundary from the other in order to be.

341
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:24,180
Without ego there is no war against anything.

342
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:30,940
There is no hubris, there is no overreaching
nature to create profit.

343
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:38,970
These external crises in our world reflect
a serious inner crises; we don’t know who

344
00:46:38,970 --> 00:46:41,329
we are.

345
00:46:41,329 --> 00:46:48,000
We are completely identified with our egoic
identities, consumed by fears and are cut

346
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,670
off from our true nature.

347
00:46:50,670 --> 00:47:00,880
Races, religions, countries, political affiliations,
any group that we belong to, all reinforce

348
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:04,900
our egoic identities.

349
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:10,220
Almost every group that exists on the planet
today wants to claim its perspective as true

350
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:15,010
and correct, as we do on an individual level.

351
00:47:15,010 --> 00:47:21,130
By claiming the truth as its own, the group
perpetuates its own existence in the same

352
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:29,920
way that an ego or self structure defines
itself against other.

353
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:35,970
Now more than ever different realities and
polarized belief systems are co-existing on

354
00:47:35,970 --> 00:47:36,970
earth.

355
00:47:36,970 --> 00:47:42,559
It is possible for different people to experience
completely different thoughts and emotional

356
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:48,529
reactions to the very same external phenomena.

357
00:47:48,529 --> 00:47:56,720
In the same way, samsara and nirvana, heaven
and hell, are two different dimensions occupying

358
00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:00,119
the very same world.

359
00:48:00,119 --> 00:48:11,839
An event that may appear apocalyptic to one
person, could be seen as a blessing to another.

360
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:17,319
So what is becoming obvious is that your external
circumstances don’t have to affect your

361
00:48:17,319 --> 00:48:22,480
inner world in any particular way.

362
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:31,369
To realize Samadhi is to become a self-propelled
wheel, to become autonomous, a universe unto

363
00:48:31,369 --> 00:48:36,490
oneself.

364
00:48:36,490 --> 00:48:44,780
Your experience of life is not contingent
on changing phenomena.

365
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:50,609
An analogy can be made with Metatron’s cube.

366
00:48:50,609 --> 00:48:57,160
Metatron is mentioned in various ancient Christian,
Islamic and Jewish texts, and is archetypally

367
00:48:57,160 --> 00:49:05,300
related to the Egyptian Neter Thoth, as well
as Hermes Trismegistus of Greece.

368
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:10,339
Metatron is intimately connected with the
tetragrammaton.

369
00:49:10,339 --> 00:49:17,400
The tetragrammaton is the fundamental geometric
pattern, the template or primordial emanation

370
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:25,960
of physical reality, which has been called
the word of God or Logos.

371
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:31,990
Here we see a two dimensional representation
of the figure, but if you look a certain way,

372
00:49:31,990 --> 00:49:35,519
you see a three D cube.

373
00:49:35,519 --> 00:49:41,849
When you see the cube, nothing has changed
in the figure, but your mind has added a new

374
00:49:41,849 --> 00:49:46,240
dimension to your seeing.

375
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:52,009
Dimensionality or one’s perspective is simply
a matter of becoming habituated to a new way

376
00:49:52,009 --> 00:49:56,319
of perceiving the world.

377
00:49:56,319 --> 00:50:03,960
Upon realizing Samadhi we become free of perspective,
or free to create new perspectives, because

378
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:12,549
there is no self invested in or attached to
a particular viewpoint.

379
00:50:12,549 --> 00:50:23,250
The greatest minds in human history have often
pointed to levels of thought beyond the limited

380
00:50:23,250 --> 00:50:25,099
self structure.

381
00:50:25,099 --> 00:50:31,980
Einstein said “The true measure of a human
being is determined primarily by the measure

382
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:38,250
and sense in which he has attained liberation
from the self.”

383
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:46,230
So it’s not that thinking and the existence
of the self is bad, thinking is a wonderful

384
00:50:46,230 --> 00:50:53,540
tool when the mind is in service to the heart.

385
00:50:53,540 --> 00:51:06,359
In Vedanta it is said that the mind makes
a good servant but a poor master.

386
00:51:06,359 --> 00:51:13,950
The ego perpetually filters reality through
language and labels, and is constantly judging.

387
00:51:13,950 --> 00:51:17,700
Preferring one thing over another.

388
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:23,850
When the mind and senses are your master,
they will create endless suffering, endless

389
00:51:23,850 --> 00:51:32,460
craving and aversion, locking us into the
matrix of thinking.

390
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:39,519
If you want to realize Samadhi, do not judge
your thoughts as good or bad, but find out

391
00:51:39,519 --> 00:51:45,790
who you are prior to thought, prior to the
senses.

392
00:51:45,790 --> 00:51:57,309
When all labels are dropped then it is possible
to see things as they are.

393
00:51:57,309 --> 00:52:05,280
The moment a child is told what a bird is,
if they believe what they’re told then they

394
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:07,690
never see a bird again.

395
00:52:07,690 --> 00:52:52,259
They only see their thoughts.

396
00:52:52,259 --> 00:52:57,609
Most people think that they are free, conscious
and awake.

397
00:52:57,609 --> 00:53:04,539
If you believe you are already awake, then
why would you do the difficult work to attain

398
00:53:04,539 --> 00:53:08,930
what you believe you already have?

399
00:53:08,930 --> 00:53:16,130
Before it becomes possible to awaken, it is
necessary to accept that you are asleep, living

400
00:53:16,130 --> 00:53:20,430
in the matrix.

401
00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:25,920
Examine your life honestly, without lying
to yourself.

402
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:32,140
Are you able to stop your robotic, repetitive
life patterns if you want to?

403
00:53:32,140 --> 00:53:40,079
Can you stop seeking pleasure and avoiding
pain, are you addicted to certain foods, activities,

404
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:41,519
pastimes?

405
00:53:41,519 --> 00:53:49,309
Are you constantly judging, blaming, criticizing
yourself and others?

406
00:53:49,309 --> 00:53:56,490
Does your mind incessantly seek out stimulus,
or are you completely fulfilled just being

407
00:53:56,490 --> 00:53:59,329
in silence?

408
00:53:59,329 --> 00:54:02,200
Do you react to how people think about you?

409
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:06,410
Are you seeking approval, positive reinforcement?

410
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:12,130
Do you somehow sabotage situations in your
life?

411
00:54:12,130 --> 00:54:17,859
Most people will experience their lives the
same way today as they will tomorrow and a

412
00:54:17,859 --> 00:54:22,829
year from now, and ten years from now.

413
00:54:22,829 --> 00:54:29,390
When you begin to observe your robot-like
nature you become more awake.

414
00:54:29,390 --> 00:54:34,809
You begin to recognize the depth of the problem.

415
00:54:34,809 --> 00:54:41,690
You are completely and utterly asleep, lost
in a dream.

416
00:54:41,690 --> 00:54:47,500
Like the inhabitants of Plato’s cave, most
who hear this truth will not be willing or

417
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:55,529
capable of changing their lives because they
are attached to their familiar patterns.

418
00:54:55,529 --> 00:55:02,500
We go to great lengths justifying our patterns,
burying our heads in the sand rather than

419
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:05,680
facing the truth.

420
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:12,300
We want our saviours, but we are not willing
to get up on the cross ourselves.

421
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:19,740
What are you willing to pay to be free?

422
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:26,300
Realize that if you change your inner world,
you must be prepared to change the outer life.

423
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:32,470
Your old structure and your old identity must
become the dead soil out of which new growth

424
00:55:32,470 --> 00:55:39,869
comes.

425
00:55:39,869 --> 00:55:45,119
The first step to awakening is to realize
that we are identified with the matrix of

426
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:49,670
the human mind, with the mask.

427
00:55:49,670 --> 00:55:55,249
Something within us must hear this truth and
be roused from its slumber.

428
00:55:55,249 --> 00:56:18,349
There is a part of you, something timeless,
that has always known the truth.

429
00:56:18,349 --> 00:56:31,749
The matrix of the mind distracts us, entertains
us, keeps us endlessly doing, consuming, grasping,

430
00:56:31,749 --> 00:56:39,160
in a cycle of craving and aversion with constantly
changing forms, keeping us from the flowering

431
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:47,829
of our consciousness, from our evolutionary
birthright which is Samadhi.

432
00:56:47,829 --> 00:56:58,380
Pathological thinking is what passes for normal
life.

433
00:56:58,380 --> 00:57:06,329
Your divine essence has become enslaved, identified
with the limited self structure.

434
00:57:06,329 --> 00:57:15,720
The great wisdom, the truth of who you are
is buried deep within your being.

435
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:27,039
J. Krishnamurti said, “It is no measure
of one’s health to be well adjusted to a

436
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:39,759
profoundly sick society.”

437
00:57:39,759 --> 00:58:02,810
Identification with the egoic mind is the
sickness and Samadhi is the cure.

438
00:58:02,810 --> 00:58:25,680
The saints, sages and awakened beings throughout
history have all learned the wisdom of self-surrender.

439
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:45,089
How is it possible to realize the true self?

440
00:58:45,089 --> 00:58:52,520
When you peer through the veil of Maya, and
let go of the illusory self, what is left?
