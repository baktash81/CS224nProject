1
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:28,030
Mother.

2
00:00:33,327 --> 00:00:35,078
You walked with me then.

3
00:00:38,832 --> 00:00:40,250
In the silence.

4
00:00:47,758 --> 00:00:49,843
Before there was a world.

5
00:00:56,016 --> 00:00:58,936
Before night or day.

6
00:01:04,149 --> 00:01:06,068
Alone in the stillness.

7
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:16,954
Where nothing was.

8
00:02:43,248 --> 00:02:44,458
Mother.

9
00:02:48,462 --> 00:02:49,838
Where are you?

10
00:03:06,146 --> 00:03:07,647
Where have you gone?

11
00:03:43,934 --> 00:03:45,268
I fear.

12
00:03:59,074 --> 00:04:00,367
Full of trouble.

13
00:04:05,288 --> 00:04:07,207
A riddle to myself.

14
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,169
Am I not your child?

15
00:05:37,881 --> 00:05:39,257
Who are you?

16
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:48,600
Life giver.

17
00:05:55,065 --> 00:05:56,733
Light bringer.

18
00:20:02,661 --> 00:20:03,913
Mother.

19
00:20:11,212 --> 00:20:12,463
Born.

20
00:20:19,678 --> 00:20:20,554
Now.

21
00:20:30,523 --> 00:20:31,649
I am.

22
00:20:44,912 --> 00:20:45,996
Life.

23
00:20:57,633 --> 00:20:58,926
Restless.

24
00:21:18,195 --> 00:21:19,822
Unsatisfied.

25
00:21:37,131 --> 00:21:38,591
I thirst.

26
00:21:55,524 --> 00:21:56,567
Light.

27
00:22:04,283 --> 00:22:05,326
Dark.

28
00:22:20,216 --> 00:22:21,926
Speak with me.

29
00:22:34,063 --> 00:22:35,272
What am I?

30
00:22:44,365 --> 00:22:45,366
Where?

31
00:23:53,309 --> 00:23:55,060
Who brought me here?

32
00:25:30,948 --> 00:25:32,199
Oh mother.

33
00:25:34,743 --> 00:25:36,412
Abyss of light.

34
00:25:46,505 --> 00:25:48,257
All beholding.

35
00:25:58,225 --> 00:25:59,435
Blazing.

36
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,653
Shining through all time.

37
00:26:38,724 --> 00:26:40,142
I touch you.

38
00:26:45,439 --> 00:26:47,357
You burn with fire.

39
00:26:54,573 --> 00:26:56,033
I tremble,

40
00:26:57,910 --> 00:26:59,828
Quake in wonder.

41
00:27:14,676 --> 00:27:16,553
Where are you leading me?

42
00:29:39,571 --> 00:29:40,781
Oh life.

43
00:29:46,495 --> 00:29:48,205
Giver of good.

44
00:29:53,669 --> 00:29:55,045
Creating yourself

45
00:29:58,006 --> 00:30:00,550
In ever changing shapes.

46
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,397
You give

47
00:30:18,568 --> 00:30:20,070
without asking.

48
00:33:17,455 --> 00:33:18,748
Nature.

49
00:33:27,299 --> 00:33:29,134
Who am I to you ?

50
00:33:45,692 --> 00:33:47,861
You devour youself

51
00:33:50,447 --> 00:33:53,450
Only to give birth to yourself again.

52
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:55,428
Will we always be together?

53
00:35:20,412 --> 00:35:22,455
Oh light of love.

54
00:35:30,839 --> 00:35:32,674
Don't be far from me.

55
00:37:04,682 --> 00:37:06,351
You waken me.

56
00:37:13,191 --> 00:37:14,984
Endless source.

57
00:37:19,614 --> 00:37:21,157
Endless river.

58
00:37:24,869 --> 00:37:27,455
Shapeless as a cloud.

59
00:37:40,552 --> 00:37:42,512
Mother of all.

60
00:37:48,268 --> 00:37:49,644
From you

61
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,732
all things ascend.

62
00:38:07,454 --> 00:38:09,622
Stone flows

63
00:38:10,582 --> 00:38:11,541
like mist.

64
00:40:21,546 --> 00:40:23,590
The many change

65
00:40:26,342 --> 00:40:27,802
and pass.

66
00:40:35,602 --> 00:40:37,103
You endure.

67
00:40:46,529 --> 00:40:48,239
A living flame

68
00:41:04,881 --> 00:41:06,924
hidden in all things.

69
00:42:22,542 --> 00:42:23,876
Where are you?

70
00:43:53,007 --> 00:43:54,008
You.

71
00:43:58,012 --> 00:44:00,264
Too great to see.

72
00:44:08,064 --> 00:44:10,525
No end to your birth.

73
00:44:17,782 --> 00:44:19,492
Eternal birth.

74
00:45:55,630 --> 00:45:57,548
What is this world?

75
00:46:04,513 --> 00:46:06,182
The stricken ox.

76
00:46:12,063 --> 00:46:13,981
The abandoned child.

77
00:46:18,653 --> 00:46:20,029
The wound.

78
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:26,202
The old woman.

79
00:46:55,523 --> 00:46:57,441
Might we be deceived?

80
00:47:11,747 --> 00:47:13,124
The soul.

81
00:47:15,543 --> 00:47:16,377
A wish.

82
00:47:20,464 --> 00:47:21,632
A dream.

83
00:47:28,848 --> 00:47:31,183
And we know nothing.

84
00:47:43,821 --> 00:47:45,072
Blind.

85
00:47:57,752 --> 00:47:59,128
Oh life.

86
00:48:06,469 --> 00:48:08,262
Hear my voice.

87
00:49:25,923 --> 00:49:27,174
Mother.

88
00:49:33,973 --> 00:49:36,559
Does your goodness never fail?

89
00:50:13,262 --> 00:50:15,014
Will you abandon me?

90
00:50:50,466 --> 00:50:52,426
Did love make me?

91
00:55:46,386 --> 00:55:47,638
Mother.

92
00:55:54,019 --> 00:55:55,729
Where have you gone?

93
00:56:05,948 --> 00:56:07,866
Why are you silent?

94
00:56:19,628 --> 00:56:22,339
Can a mother forget her child?

95
00:56:36,478 --> 00:56:38,105
You do nothing.

96
00:56:42,192 --> 00:56:43,986
See nothing wrong.

97
00:56:57,499 --> 00:56:59,001
I fear you.

98
00:57:04,798 --> 00:57:07,676
You, whom I should love.

99
00:58:04,941 --> 00:58:06,693
So much joy.

100
00:58:12,824 --> 00:58:14,660
Why not always?

101
00:58:23,418 --> 00:58:25,170
Giver of good.

102
00:58:35,639 --> 00:58:36,932
Life.

103
00:59:23,895 --> 00:59:25,188
To you

104
00:59:27,649 --> 00:59:29,776
all things flow back.

105
00:59:39,202 --> 00:59:40,537
The bridge.

106
00:59:46,543 --> 00:59:47,919
The gate.

107
01:01:47,163 --> 01:01:48,498
Oh mother.

108
01:02:00,260 --> 01:02:02,137
What did they accomplish?

109
01:02:06,516 --> 01:02:07,767
Sorrow.

110
01:02:12,564 --> 01:02:13,773
Pain.

111
01:03:35,021 --> 01:03:36,314
Time.

112
01:03:44,072 --> 01:03:45,448
Ravaging.

113
01:03:52,580 --> 01:03:54,332
Devouring all.

114
01:04:09,264 --> 01:04:10,849
What lasts?

115
01:04:50,638 --> 01:04:52,557
How do I reach you?

116
01:05:10,033 --> 01:05:11,159
You,

117
01:05:15,497 --> 01:05:19,793
the good towards which all things aspire.

118
01:05:34,974 --> 01:05:36,643
Beyond time.

119
01:05:45,527 --> 01:05:47,320
Beyond sorrow.

120
01:16:26,459 --> 01:16:27,543
Mother.

121
01:16:36,510 --> 01:16:38,220
What do I love,

122
01:16:42,391 --> 01:16:44,143
when I love you?

123
01:17:04,830 --> 01:17:05,873
You.

124
01:17:10,503 --> 01:17:11,796
The light.

125
01:17:14,507 --> 01:17:15,800
The dark.

126
01:17:19,845 --> 01:17:21,222
The moth.

127
01:17:24,183 --> 01:17:25,309
The flame.

128
01:17:30,648 --> 01:17:32,024
The friend

129
01:17:34,235 --> 01:17:35,903
and the stranger.

130
01:17:41,033 --> 01:17:42,409
The wine

131
01:17:44,161 --> 01:17:45,079
and the cup.

132
01:17:59,718 --> 01:18:00,928
The dawn.

133
01:18:06,725 --> 01:18:08,143
Our light.

134
01:18:41,635 --> 01:18:42,595
Oh mother.

135
01:18:50,311 --> 01:18:52,438
The tears you wept.

136
01:18:56,525 --> 01:18:58,903
The scenes you've looked on.

137
01:19:03,908 --> 01:19:05,326
Love poured out.

138
01:19:10,539 --> 01:19:12,166
The strivings.

139
01:19:18,547 --> 01:19:19,924
Hopes.

140
01:19:56,669 --> 01:19:59,004
The shadows flee.

141
01:20:06,762 --> 01:20:08,138
The show.

142
01:20:20,567 --> 01:20:24,405
Time goes back to her source.

143
01:21:11,702 --> 01:21:12,995
Mother.

144
01:21:19,543 --> 01:21:21,420
I take your hand.

145
01:21:29,303 --> 01:21:30,763
I dream no more.

146
01:21:37,311 --> 01:21:39,146
Joined to you.

147
01:21:44,985 --> 01:21:48,238
Leaf to branch.

148
01:21:52,367 --> 01:21:55,370
Branch to tree.

149
01:22:06,131 --> 01:22:08,717
Love binds us together.

150
01:22:47,172 --> 01:22:49,216
What lives in you

151
01:22:51,009 --> 01:22:52,219
can't die.

152
01:23:04,815 --> 01:23:06,191
Oh life!

153
01:23:13,866 --> 01:23:14,999
Oh mother!
