Boy:
Did Mama sing every day?

18
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,561
Every single day?

19
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:36,563
Girl:
Every single day.

20
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:40,066
And did Papa sing, too?

21
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:43,069
Yes, Papa sang, too.

22
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:45,071
Don't get so close, Caleb.

23
00:01:45,071 --> 00:01:47,073
You'll heat up.

24
00:01:47,073 --> 00:01:50,577
What did I look like
when I was born?

25
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:52,078
You didn't have
any clothes on.

26
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:53,580
I know that.

27
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,583
You looked like this.

28
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:58,585
I had hair.

29
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:00,086
Not enough
to talk about.

30
00:02:00,086 --> 00:02:02,589
And she named me Caleb

31
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:05,592
'cause Caleb means bold.

32
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:08,595
I would have named you
"troublesome."

33
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:12,098
And before she died,
Mama handed me to you

34
00:02:12,098 --> 00:02:14,601
in a yellow blanket
and said...?

35
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:17,103
And said...?

36
00:02:17,103 --> 00:02:21,107
And Mama said,
"Isn't he beautiful, Anna?"

37
00:02:21,107 --> 00:02:23,109
And I was.

38
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:24,611
The end.

39
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:27,614
That's your end
of the story, Caleb.

40
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:30,116
I thought
when you were born--

41
00:02:30,116 --> 00:02:32,619
I said you were
homely and plain

42
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:36,623
and you had a terrible holler
and a horrid smell.

43
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:42,162
And that it was my fault
Mama died the next morning?

44
00:02:46,549 --> 00:02:51,554
I never thought that,
Caleb-- never.

45
00:02:51,554 --> 00:02:55,058
I forgot to say
good night to her.

46
00:02:55,058 --> 00:02:57,560
That's all
I could think about.

47
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:01,064
And Papa didn't
sing anymore?

48
00:03:06,069 --> 00:03:09,572
Caleb:
Do you remember
Mama's songs, Anna?

49
00:03:09,572 --> 00:03:12,075
Anna:
Kind of. Some of them.

50
00:03:12,075 --> 00:03:17,080
Caleb:
Maybe if you could remember her
songs I could remember her, too.

51
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:21,084
(Caleb humming "Billy Boy")

52
00:03:32,061 --> 00:03:35,064
Nice soapy smell,
that dough.

53
00:03:35,064 --> 00:03:37,567
That's my hair, Papa.

54
00:03:44,073 --> 00:03:47,076
I caught
a horny toad today, Papa

55
00:03:47,076 --> 00:03:49,078
and I kept him
in my pocket.

56
00:03:49,579 --> 00:03:51,080
Is he still in your pocket?

57
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,082
I put him
in the vegetable garden

58
00:03:53,082 --> 00:03:55,084
so he can eat
all the bugs.

59
00:03:55,084 --> 00:03:57,587
Good thinking.

60
00:03:57,587 --> 00:03:59,088
Caleb...

61
00:04:10,099 --> 00:04:14,604
God, thank you for all the food
except the turnip.

62
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:25,565
A while back I placed
an advertisement

63
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:27,567
in the newspaper.

64
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:29,052
An advertisement?

65
00:04:29,052 --> 00:04:30,453
What for?

66
00:04:30,453 --> 00:04:31,454
Someone to
help us out.

67
00:04:31,454 --> 00:04:33,289
Another
housekeeper?

68
00:04:33,289 --> 00:04:36,292
Not like Kelley;
she snored.

69
00:04:36,292 --> 00:04:38,294
No, not for a housekeeper.

70
00:04:38,294 --> 00:04:39,796
Well, then...
Hush.

71
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:44,717
For a wife.

72
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:47,720
You mean a mother?

73
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,023
That, too.

74
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:52,241
We had a mother.

75
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:55,728
There.

76
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:58,231
"Needed: A kind woman
to share a life

77
00:04:58,231 --> 00:05:01,567
"with a widower and his
two young children

78
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:04,070
"to make a
difference.

79
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,706
No picture necessary."

80
00:05:07,156 --> 00:05:08,157
Oh, Papa.

81
00:05:08,157 --> 00:05:12,161
I have received an answer.

82
00:05:12,161 --> 00:05:14,947
"Dear Mr. Jacob Witting:

83
00:05:14,947 --> 00:05:18,668
"I am Sarah Wheaton
from Maine.

84
00:05:18,668 --> 00:05:20,586
Sarah:
I am answering your
advertisement.

85
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:22,588
I live with an older brother
William

86
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:24,090
who is about to be married.

87
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:26,592
I have always loved
to live by the sea

88
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:29,595
but at this time,
I feel a move is necessary

89
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:33,099
and the truth is, the sea
is as far east as I can go.

90
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:36,102
My choice, as you can see,
is limited.

91
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:39,605
This should not be taken
as an insult.

92
00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:44,110
I am strong and I work hard
and I'm willing to travel

93
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,612
but I am not mild-mannered.

94
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:48,614
If you should still care
to write

95
00:05:48,614 --> 00:05:51,117
I would be interested
in your children

96
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:53,119
and about where you live
and you.

97
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:58,157
Very truly yours,
Sarah Elizabeth Wheaton.

98
00:05:58,157 --> 00:06:01,994
"P.S.: Do you have
opinions on cats?

99
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:03,496
I have one."

100
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:04,997
Papa?

101
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:05,998
Yes.

102
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:09,001
Ask her if she sings.

103
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:24,233
Jacob:
The children are named
Caleb and Anna.

104
00:06:24,233 --> 00:06:26,736
Caleb is the youngest--
only six.

105
00:06:26,736 --> 00:06:29,238
Too young to write
a long letter

106
00:06:29,238 --> 00:06:33,743
he asked me to send you
the footprint of his dog Nick.

107
00:06:33,743 --> 00:06:37,747
He asked if you could live
in a house with small rooms.

108
00:06:37,747 --> 00:06:41,250
He wanted me to tell you
he holds his breath--

109
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:44,754
that he has been holding
his breath for a long time.

110
00:06:44,754 --> 00:06:46,255
There you are.

111
00:06:48,257 --> 00:06:50,259
Sarah, you don't
have to go.

112
00:06:50,259 --> 00:06:51,260
You're wrong,
Will; I do.

113
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,762
There's plenty of room
in that house.

114
00:06:53,262 --> 00:06:54,263
Meg wants you
to live with us.

115
00:06:54,263 --> 00:06:55,765
Nothing has to change.

116
00:06:55,765 --> 00:06:58,267
Things do change
if you let them.

117
00:06:58,267 --> 00:07:00,770
You belong here.

118
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:01,771
If I don't go now

119
00:07:01,771 --> 00:07:05,775
I'll never know what it's like
to have my own life.

120
00:07:05,775 --> 00:07:06,776
But, Sarah...

121
00:07:06,776 --> 00:07:08,277
This is my chance, Will.

122
00:07:28,297 --> 00:07:29,298
Jacob!

123
00:07:29,298 --> 00:07:31,801
It's been so long,
you broke Jack, finally.

124
00:07:31,801 --> 00:07:33,302
More or less.

125
00:07:33,302 --> 00:07:34,804
Caleb:
He loves Jack...

126
00:07:34,804 --> 00:07:36,305
no matter how bad he is.

127
00:07:36,305 --> 00:07:38,808
Maggie:
You look tired, Anna.

128
00:07:38,808 --> 00:07:39,809
Stay for supper

129
00:07:39,809 --> 00:07:41,310
can you?

130
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:44,313
I've got chicken left over,
biscuits, currant pie...

131
00:07:44,313 --> 00:07:45,815
We found some baby rabbits.

132
00:07:45,815 --> 00:07:46,816
Want to see?

133
00:07:46,816 --> 00:07:48,818
Yes!

134
00:07:48,818 --> 00:07:50,319
How many
are there?

135
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,822
(sighs)

136
00:07:52,822 --> 00:07:54,824
So, you look fine.

137
00:07:54,824 --> 00:07:57,827
(chuckling):
Big, Jacob. I look big.

138
00:07:57,827 --> 00:07:59,829
And what about
you, Jacob?

139
00:07:59,829 --> 00:08:01,330
Anything new?

140
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:03,332
Go ahead, Anna.

141
00:08:03,332 --> 00:08:05,334
Go with the others.

142
00:08:06,335 --> 00:08:07,336
Jacob...

143
00:08:07,336 --> 00:08:10,339
is something wrong?

144
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,843
I've had a reply
to my advertisement.

145
00:08:13,843 --> 00:08:14,844
A woman in Maine.

146
00:08:14,844 --> 00:08:16,345
She's interested?

147
00:08:16,345 --> 00:08:18,347
She's coming.

148
00:08:20,349 --> 00:08:21,851
Forgive me, Jacob

149
00:08:21,851 --> 00:08:24,854
but are you ready
for what is going to be like?

150
00:08:27,857 --> 00:08:29,859
I better start supper.

151
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:45,374
Sarah:
Dear Anna, my favorite colors
are the colors of the sea--

152
00:08:45,374 --> 00:08:48,878
blue and gray and green,
depending on the weather.

153
00:08:48,878 --> 00:08:51,380
My brother William
is a fisherman

154
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:55,167
and he tells me that when he is
in the middle of a fogbound sea

155
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:58,671
the water is a color
for which there is no name.

156
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:02,675
He catches flounder
and sea bass and bluefish.

157
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:05,678
Sometimes he sees whales.

158
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:12,685
(dishes clattering)

159
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:23,696
Anna?

160
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:25,698
You have nice things...

161
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:27,700
all around you.

162
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,703
Oh, darling...

163
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:32,705
your mama had
nice things, too.

164
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:34,206
Do you remember?

165
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:35,708
A little.

166
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:38,711
I remember candlesticks
on the table;

167
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:41,714
a painting of a black bird;

168
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:45,718
a quilt Mama made--
stars of color.

169
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:47,720
Papa put them away.

170
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,722
I know.

171
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:55,728
Your mama made this for me
a long time ago

172
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:58,731
when you were a little girl,
before Caleb.

173
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:02,735
Somehow this shawl makes me

174
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:05,237
less lonely for her.

175
00:10:05,237 --> 00:10:07,740
She won't stay, Maggie.

176
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,241
I know she won't.

177
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:11,243
I don't want her to come.

178
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:14,246
Anna,I came
to be Matthew's wife--

179
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:17,249
Rose and Violet's mother--

180
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:20,252
when they lost
their mother--I stayed.

181
00:10:20,252 --> 00:10:23,255
But what if she's
not like you?

182
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:27,760
Your papa won't do anything
what isn't right for you.

183
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,763
What if he doesn't know
what is right for us?

184
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:39,271
Maggie:
♪ Come on, ye fair ♪

185
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:44,777
♪ And tender maiden ♪
(harmonica accompanying)

186
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:49,281
♪ Take warning how ♪

187
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:54,286
♪ You court young men ♪

188
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:58,791
(children joining in):
♪ They're like a star ♪

189
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:03,796
? On a summer's morning ?

190
00:11:03,796 --> 00:11:08,801
♪ As they appear ♪

191
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:14,306
♪ And then they're gone... ♪

192
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:15,808
(Maggie humming)

193
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:18,310
Caleb:
Maybe I could
get a harmonica.

194
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:20,813
I could carry it with me
wherever I go.

195
00:11:21,313 --> 00:11:24,817
It would be like a little music
in my pocket.

196
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:30,823
Jacob:
Caleb, Anna... time to go.

197
00:11:33,826 --> 00:11:35,327
Thank you both.

198
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:36,328
Wait, Jacob.

199
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:39,331
For Anna.

200
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:40,833
No need for that, Maggie.

201
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:43,836
Let her keep it. Please.

202
00:11:45,254 --> 00:11:46,255
Anna.

203
00:11:46,255 --> 00:11:49,258
Thank you, Maggie.

204
00:11:49,258 --> 00:11:50,760
Come on.

205
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:05,191
(horse neighing)

206
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:07,693
(rain falling)

207
00:12:07,693 --> 00:12:09,695
Read my letter again, Anna.

208
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:11,697
You said you would.

209
00:12:11,697 --> 00:12:14,700
You've memorized it already.

210
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,203
Just read it.

211
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:22,708
"Dear Caleb,
my cat's name is 'Seal'

212
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:24,977
"because she is gray
like the seals

213
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:27,012
"that swim offshore in Maine.

214
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:29,815
"She is glad that Nick
sends his greetings.

215
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:31,851
"She likes dogs
most of the time.

216
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:35,054
"She says his footprint
is much larger than hers

217
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:36,972
which she is enclosing
in return."

218
00:12:36,972 --> 00:12:39,442
Caleb:
Papa, look!

219
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:43,312
"Yes, Icankeep a fire
going at night.

220
00:12:43,312 --> 00:12:45,181
"I do not know if I snore.

221
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:47,566
Seal has never told me."

222
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:49,568
Thank you.

223
00:12:53,572 --> 00:12:56,075
Read your letter
again, Papa.

224
00:12:59,495 --> 00:13:01,831
(thunder rolling)

225
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:08,287
"Dear Jacob:

226
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:10,689
"I will come by train.

227
00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:12,691
"I will wear a yellow bonnet.

228
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:15,895
"I will stay
for one month

229
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:17,730
"to see if I can
make a difference.

230
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:20,649
"Very truly
yours, Sarah.

231
00:13:20,649 --> 00:13:24,253
P.S.: I'm plain and tall."

232
00:13:24,253 --> 00:13:25,571
Caleb:
She's really coming.

233
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:28,274
Doesn't mean she'll stay.

234
00:13:30,659 --> 00:13:32,161
What's that written
at the bottom?

235
00:13:32,161 --> 00:13:34,663
"Tell them I sing."

236
00:13:34,663 --> 00:13:37,750
"Tell them I sing."

237
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:45,090
(whistle blowing)

238
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:30,970
Jacob:
Anna?

239
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:39,478
Why did you ask her to come?

240
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:40,980
We don't need
a stranger.

241
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,481
You and Caleb need someone.

242
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:43,482
We don't!

243
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:44,984
We're fine by ourselves.

244
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:46,986
She won't be my mother.

245
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:48,988
She can be Caleb's,
but not mine.

246
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:49,989
Anna.

247
00:14:53,492 --> 00:14:57,496
This doesn't mean
we'll forget Mama.

248
00:14:57,496 --> 00:15:00,416
I get so scared, Papa.

249
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:04,336
Sometimes I can't
remember what she
looked like.

250
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:08,007
Go, Papa. You'll be late.

251
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:10,509
Not until
you're all right.

252
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:12,511
Not until you smile.

253
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:16,015
(sobbing)

254
00:15:21,804 --> 00:15:23,772
(whistle blowing)

255
00:16:10,819 --> 00:16:12,321
(cat meowing)

256
00:16:12,321 --> 00:16:13,822
Ma'am?

257
00:16:13,822 --> 00:16:17,326
One-way ticket, please,
to Camden, Maine.

258
00:16:17,326 --> 00:16:19,828
Let's see. Camden, Maine.

259
00:16:25,834 --> 00:16:26,835
There you are.

260
00:16:36,845 --> 00:16:38,347
Thank you.

261
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:54,480
Sarah?

262
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,981
Sarah Wheaton?

263
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,451
Mr. Witting.

264
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:07,793
Is your trunk outside?

265
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:09,294
Yes.

266
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:12,798
I'm Jacob.

267
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:14,800
Yes.

268
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,301
(cat meowing)

269
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:17,302
Your cat?

270
00:17:17,302 --> 00:17:18,804
Yes. No, thank you.

271
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:20,305
I'll carry it.

272
00:17:30,766 --> 00:17:32,768
This is my trunk.

273
00:17:36,271 --> 00:17:37,272
(cat meowing)

274
00:17:37,272 --> 00:17:38,273
There you are.

275
00:18:11,306 --> 00:18:12,808
Man:
Afternoon, Jacob.

276
00:18:19,314 --> 00:18:21,817
Is it my hat?

277
00:18:23,819 --> 00:18:25,821
We don't get many
new people here.

278
00:18:25,821 --> 00:18:28,323
Not many visitors.

279
00:18:28,323 --> 00:18:30,325
So I see.

280
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:50,362
Is my face clean?

281
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:53,365
Can my face
be too clean?

282
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:55,868
No, your face isnot
too clean.

283
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:02,875
What if she thinks
we're loud and pesky?

284
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,377
You are loud and pesky.

285
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:08,380
Sarah loves the sea.

286
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,382
We don't have a sea.

287
00:19:12,384 --> 00:19:13,886
(sighing)

288
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:16,388
What if she doesn't
like our house?

289
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:18,390
I told her it was small.

290
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:22,394
Maybe I shouldn't have
told her it was small.

291
00:19:22,394 --> 00:19:24,897
Hush, Caleb... hush.

292
00:19:26,398 --> 00:19:30,402
Will she be nice
like Maggie?

293
00:19:30,402 --> 00:19:31,904
I don't know.

294
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:34,406
Wait... just wait.

295
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:36,408
How far away is Maine?

296
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:38,911
You know how far.

297
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:40,913
Now leave me alone,
Caleb.

298
00:19:42,414 --> 00:19:44,917
Will she like us?

299
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:47,920
Of course,
she will like us.

300
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,922
We are nice.

301
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:56,428
It's six miles
from town to home.

302
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:01,934
Some say the spaces here
make them nervous.

303
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:04,436
I'm used to the open sea.

304
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:10,943
How's the train?

305
00:20:11,443 --> 00:20:13,946
Fine.
Comfortable enough.

306
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:16,949
Where are the children?

307
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:18,951
Home.

308
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:22,955
I thought the two
of us should...

309
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:25,457
It would be simpler.

310
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:28,460
We could talk.

311
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:36,468
Anna is shy about this

312
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:38,971
but Caleb loves
your letters.

313
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:44,476
My wife died six years ago.

314
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:46,478
It's been difficult
for me.

315
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:48,480
I hope you...

316
00:20:50,482 --> 00:20:52,985
I hope you
won't expect...

317
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:54,486
It's all right,
Mr. Witting.

318
00:20:54,486 --> 00:20:56,989
I didn't come for love.

319
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:02,494
What I was saying is...

320
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:05,998
I hope you won't
expect the house

321
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:08,500
to be in
perfect order.

322
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,003
I didn't ask for love.

323
00:21:25,517 --> 00:21:28,020
A bonnet, Anna.

324
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,022
I see a
yellow bonnet.

325
00:22:14,232 --> 00:22:16,735
Whoa!

326
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:18,236
(barking)

327
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:20,238
Nick!

328
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:31,249
Did you bring some sea?

329
00:22:31,249 --> 00:22:33,752
Something from the sea...

330
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:34,753
and me.

331
00:22:34,753 --> 00:22:36,254
(cat meowing)

332
00:22:36,254 --> 00:22:37,756
And Seal, too.

333
00:22:38,757 --> 00:22:40,258
(cat meowing)

334
00:22:45,263 --> 00:22:47,265
(Nick barking)

335
00:22:49,267 --> 00:22:51,269
Jacob:
Cat will be good.

336
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:52,771
In the barn, for mice.

337
00:22:52,771 --> 00:22:55,774
She'll be good in the house,
too.

338
00:23:04,232 --> 00:23:06,234
I brought this for you, Caleb.

339
00:23:06,735 --> 00:23:07,736
Where I live

340
00:23:07,736 --> 00:23:11,740
the gulls fly high
and drop shells
on the rocks below.

341
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:15,243
When the shell is broken,
they eat what's inside.

342
00:23:15,243 --> 00:23:16,745
That is very smart.

343
00:23:17,746 --> 00:23:21,249
And Anna, this
is for you.

344
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:23,251
A sea stone.

345
00:23:23,251 --> 00:23:25,754
The sea washes over
and over and around it

346
00:23:25,754 --> 00:23:27,255
rolling it until
it's round

347
00:23:27,756 --> 00:23:28,256
and perfect.

348
00:23:28,757 --> 00:23:29,758
That is very smart, too.

349
00:23:30,759 --> 00:23:32,260
No, thank you.

350
00:23:33,261 --> 00:23:35,263
(cat meowing)

351
00:23:37,766 --> 00:23:39,267
Caleb...

352
00:23:39,267 --> 00:23:41,269
Caleb means "bold."

353
00:23:41,269 --> 00:23:42,771
Are you bold?

354
00:23:42,771 --> 00:23:44,272
Yes, very.

355
00:23:47,275 --> 00:23:50,278
When will we sing?

356
00:23:50,278 --> 00:23:51,780
I like to sing.

357
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:52,781
So do I.

358
00:23:52,781 --> 00:23:54,282
Soon.

359
00:24:10,048 --> 00:24:12,551
She isn't snoring.

360
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:14,553
Shh.

361
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:16,054
Jacob:
Caleb, Anna.

362
00:24:16,054 --> 00:24:17,556
Chores.

363
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:25,564
(Nick whimpering)

364
00:24:31,486 --> 00:24:33,989
(Seal meowing)

365
00:25:02,484 --> 00:25:05,487
(Nick barking)

366
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:54,035
(sighing)

367
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:11,469
(cow mooing)

368
00:26:15,473 --> 00:26:16,975
(Seal meowing)

369
00:26:19,978 --> 00:26:22,480
Seal likes it here, Papa.

370
00:26:28,987 --> 00:26:30,488
(door opening)

371
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,528
(cow mooing)

372
00:26:36,528 --> 00:26:39,030
Seal is happy here, Sarah.

373
00:26:43,501 --> 00:26:46,371
(horse whinnying)

374
00:26:51,876 --> 00:26:54,379
Caleb's pretty eager.

375
00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:56,381
I know.

376
00:26:57,382 --> 00:26:58,883
Who made the coffee?

377
00:26:58,883 --> 00:27:00,885
Anna... trying her hand
at it.

378
00:27:00,885 --> 00:27:03,388
Well, she doesn't
drink it, does she?

379
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:05,390
After this, I'll
make the coffee

380
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:06,391
and I'll get up
earlier.

381
00:27:06,391 --> 00:27:07,392
No matter.

382
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:09,894
You're a guest here
for a month.

383
00:27:13,231 --> 00:27:16,234
Would you like to see
the barn... animals?

384
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:19,704
Could we walk first?

385
00:27:19,704 --> 00:27:21,206
Sure.

386
00:27:26,711 --> 00:27:28,713
It's windy here.

387
00:27:28,713 --> 00:27:31,716
Not too many trees
to protect us from it.

388
00:27:31,716 --> 00:27:34,219
Katherine never really
liked the wind.

389
00:27:34,219 --> 00:27:36,221
Said it made a
sad sound at night

390
00:27:36,221 --> 00:27:39,724
like it was looking for
something it couldn't find.

391
00:27:39,724 --> 00:27:41,726
Over here is sorghum.

392
00:27:41,726 --> 00:27:43,228
We'll harvest
that soon.

393
00:27:43,228 --> 00:27:45,230
You'll have
to teach me.

394
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:46,731
No, that's
not for you.

395
00:27:46,731 --> 00:27:50,235
I hope you won't think of me
as just a guest, Jacob.

396
00:27:50,235 --> 00:27:51,736
I've worked
all my life.

397
00:27:51,736 --> 00:27:53,738
Fine, but there are
certain things that...

398
00:27:53,738 --> 00:27:54,739
I'm used
to rolling up my sleeves

399
00:27:54,739 --> 00:27:57,242
working alongside my brother,
doing what needs to be done.

400
00:27:57,242 --> 00:27:59,744
And I'm used to having
things done a certain way.

401
00:27:59,744 --> 00:28:01,746
And I'm not used
to being told what to do.

402
00:28:01,746 --> 00:28:02,747
I see that.

403
00:28:02,747 --> 00:28:05,250
Our ways, perhaps,
are different, but...

404
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:07,752
Ways can change.

405
00:28:07,752 --> 00:28:10,255
Stubborn, aren't you?

406
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:12,757
And you're not?

407
00:28:12,757 --> 00:28:14,259
(bird chirping)

408
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:18,263
Friendly, Anna.

409
00:28:18,263 --> 00:28:19,264
They're friendly.

410
00:28:19,264 --> 00:28:20,765
They're not.

411
00:28:20,765 --> 00:28:22,267
They're not?

412
00:28:22,267 --> 00:28:24,769
I think...
I think Sarah's not...
Sarah...

413
00:28:24,769 --> 00:28:26,771
what Papa thought
she'd be.
Sarah...

414
00:28:26,771 --> 00:28:30,275
Papa thought she'd
be like Mama.

415
00:28:30,275 --> 00:28:33,278
Mama did everything
Papa wanted.

416
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:34,279
Oh.

417
00:28:37,282 --> 00:28:40,652
(birds chirping)

418
00:28:40,652 --> 00:28:42,654
Sarah:
Here's one of my treasures,
a crab.

419
00:28:45,156 --> 00:28:47,459
This is a sea urchin.

420
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:48,877
You can touch it.

421
00:28:51,246 --> 00:28:53,248
Here's a scallop.

422
00:28:53,248 --> 00:28:56,084
Look at that
pretty design.

423
00:28:56,084 --> 00:28:59,087
Anna, there's a razor
clam on my bed stand.

424
00:28:59,087 --> 00:29:00,588
Would you get
it for me?

425
00:29:04,592 --> 00:29:07,095
Here's a mussel...

426
00:29:07,095 --> 00:29:09,564
and a sea snail--

427
00:29:09,564 --> 00:29:10,899
very simple

428
00:29:10,899 --> 00:29:12,917
and beautiful.

429
00:29:15,353 --> 00:29:19,023
This is a sea clam.

430
00:29:19,023 --> 00:29:20,442
What's the big one?

431
00:29:20,442 --> 00:29:22,944
Oh, this is a conch shell
someone gave me.

432
00:29:23,445 --> 00:29:25,447
Now, if you hold it to your ear

433
00:29:25,447 --> 00:29:27,449
you can hear the sea.

434
00:29:29,451 --> 00:29:30,952
Papa

435
00:29:30,952 --> 00:29:31,953
listen.

436
00:29:31,953 --> 00:29:32,954
You can.

437
00:29:35,457 --> 00:29:38,426
Wow, that is nice.

438
00:29:38,426 --> 00:29:40,345
So, that's the sea.

439
00:29:43,414 --> 00:29:47,152
Anna, listen.

440
00:29:47,152 --> 00:29:48,603
(horse nickering)

441
00:29:48,603 --> 00:29:50,104
(dog barking)

442
00:29:55,610 --> 00:29:57,612
At least Sarah
can hear the sea.

443
00:30:01,115 --> 00:30:02,066
(creaking)

444
00:30:02,066 --> 00:30:03,067
Good evening, Jess.

445
00:30:03,067 --> 00:30:04,569
Jacob.

446
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:08,072
Matthew says you might need
help later with the harvest.

447
00:30:08,072 --> 00:30:09,574
I'm looking for work.

448
00:30:09,574 --> 00:30:12,577
Yeah, for the harvest
I can use you and your horses.

449
00:30:12,577 --> 00:30:14,078
(creaking)

450
00:30:14,078 --> 00:30:15,079
This is Sarah Wheaton.

451
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,081
She's a friend from Maine.

452
00:30:17,081 --> 00:30:18,583
Jess Stearns, Sarah.

453
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:20,084
I've been to Maine.

454
00:30:20,084 --> 00:30:21,085
Really?

455
00:30:21,085 --> 00:30:22,086
Portland.

456
00:30:22,086 --> 00:30:23,087
It was beautiful

457
00:30:23,087 --> 00:30:24,589
and the ships
and the water...

458
00:30:24,589 --> 00:30:26,090
cobblestone streets.

459
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:27,091
Yeah.

460
00:30:27,091 --> 00:30:29,093
You sure you got
no work here now

461
00:30:29,093 --> 00:30:30,094
m-maybe mending fences?

462
00:30:30,094 --> 00:30:32,096
I could bed down in the barn.

463
00:30:32,096 --> 00:30:33,097
Fences, maybe.

464
00:30:33,097 --> 00:30:34,599
Not right now,
though, Jess.

465
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:37,602
I got to go to Topeka
for posts and wire.

466
00:30:39,103 --> 00:30:40,605
Well, then...

467
00:30:40,605 --> 00:30:42,607
I'll see you
at the picnic?

468
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:44,108
Well, I don't know.

469
00:30:44,108 --> 00:30:47,962
Papa's taking Sarah
to the picnic.

470
00:30:47,962 --> 00:30:49,464
Then, I will see you there?

471
00:30:49,464 --> 00:30:52,467
We'll talk about Maine.

472
00:30:52,467 --> 00:30:54,469
(insects buzzing)

473
00:30:54,469 --> 00:30:55,970
Evening, folks.

474
00:31:01,976 --> 00:31:03,978
It's at the church

475
00:31:03,978 --> 00:31:05,480
the picnic.

476
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,482
We schedule
the harvesting...

477
00:31:07,482 --> 00:31:08,983
sign on workers.

478
00:31:08,983 --> 00:31:10,985
There's food and music.

479
00:31:10,985 --> 00:31:13,488
Caleb:
And dancing.

480
00:31:13,488 --> 00:31:14,989
Papa never dances.

481
00:31:14,989 --> 00:31:17,492
Everybody dances.

482
00:31:17,492 --> 00:31:18,493
Not me.

483
00:31:18,493 --> 00:31:20,495
I don't know
how to dance.

484
00:31:20,495 --> 00:31:21,996
Well, then,
I'll teach you.

485
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,501
Here.

486
00:31:26,501 --> 00:31:28,503
Put this
in my pocket.

487
00:31:28,503 --> 00:31:30,004
Put your hand here.

488
00:31:30,004 --> 00:31:31,005
You ready?

489
00:31:31,005 --> 00:31:32,006
Mm-hmm.

490
00:31:32,006 --> 00:31:34,008
One, two, three...

491
00:31:34,008 --> 00:31:36,511
One, two, three...

492
00:31:36,511 --> 00:31:38,513
One, two, three...

493
00:31:38,513 --> 00:31:40,014
One, two, three...

494
00:31:40,014 --> 00:31:41,516
One, two, three...

495
00:31:41,516 --> 00:31:44,519
Maybe... couldn't we...
just the four of us

496
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:48,523
have our own dance here,
away from everybody?

497
00:31:59,534 --> 00:32:01,035
Where are you going?

498
00:32:01,035 --> 00:32:02,036
To pick flowers.

499
00:32:02,036 --> 00:32:05,039
I'll hang some of them
upside down to dry

500
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:07,041
so they'll keep
their color.

501
00:32:07,542 --> 00:32:10,044
There'll be flowers
all winter long.

502
00:32:10,044 --> 00:32:12,046
Sarah said, "Winter."

503
00:32:12,046 --> 00:32:14,048
That means
she will stay.

504
00:32:14,048 --> 00:32:16,050
Wait, I'll come, too!

505
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:18,052
(dog barking)

506
00:32:35,653 --> 00:32:37,655
(dog barking)

507
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,082
(horse nickering)

508
00:33:25,486 --> 00:33:26,988
Whoa.

509
00:33:35,496 --> 00:33:37,498
(tongue clicking)

510
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:04,992
(bird calling)

511
00:34:04,992 --> 00:34:08,496
Do you miss the
sea a lot, Sarah?

512
00:34:08,496 --> 00:34:09,997
Yeah.

513
00:34:09,997 --> 00:34:11,499
Yeah, I do...

514
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,504
but the land here rolls
a little like the sea

515
00:34:16,504 --> 00:34:20,007
and when the wind ripples
over the grass

516
00:34:20,007 --> 00:34:23,010
it looks just like the wind
on the sea.

517
00:34:41,529 --> 00:34:43,531
I've never seen
this before.

518
00:34:43,531 --> 00:34:45,032
What's it called?

519
00:34:47,535 --> 00:34:49,537
Bride's bonnet.

520
00:34:49,537 --> 00:34:51,539
(cat meows)

521
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,543
Well, we don't have it in Maine.

522
00:34:55,543 --> 00:34:59,046
We have seaside goldenrod
and wild asters

523
00:34:59,046 --> 00:35:00,548
and woolly ragwort.

524
00:35:00,548 --> 00:35:02,550
"Woolly ragwort"?

525
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:05,052
(chuckling):
Isn't that a name?

526
00:35:05,052 --> 00:35:06,053
(chair sliding)

527
00:35:06,053 --> 00:35:09,056
Caleb:

528
00:35:09,056 --> 00:35:12,560

532
00:35:21,068 --> 00:35:22,570
Anna...

533
00:35:30,077 --> 00:35:31,579
Caleb.

534
00:35:37,585 --> 00:35:38,586
God

535
00:35:38,586 --> 00:35:40,588
thank you for all the food.

536
00:35:40,588 --> 00:35:42,089
Thank you for sending us Sarah.

537
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:45,226
Would you please help
her like it here?

538
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:47,628
Amen.

539
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:50,631
(cat meows)

540
00:35:55,136 --> 00:35:56,637
Supper's fine, Sarah.

541
00:35:56,637 --> 00:35:58,639
Ayah.

542
00:35:58,639 --> 00:36:00,141
Bread, too.

543
00:36:00,141 --> 00:36:01,642
Papa baked it.

544
00:36:01,642 --> 00:36:04,145
It's my mother's recipe.

545
00:36:08,149 --> 00:36:10,151
What does "ayah" mean?

546
00:36:10,651 --> 00:36:13,654
Well, where I come from,
it means, "Yes."

547
00:36:14,155 --> 00:36:15,656
Want some beans?

548
00:36:15,656 --> 00:36:16,657
Ayah.

549
00:36:21,662 --> 00:36:24,165

(hands clapping)

561
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:56,614
Sarah:
My mama used to sing that to me
when I was your age, Caleb.

562
00:36:56,614 --> 00:36:58,115
Caleb:
I like it.

563
00:36:58,115 --> 00:36:59,116
Sing it again.

564
00:36:59,116 --> 00:37:00,618
All right.

00:37:00,618 --> 00:37:05,623

Sing, Jacob.

570
00:37:14,098 --> 00:37:17,602
(crickets chirping)

00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:19,604

577
00:37:47,081 --> 00:37:49,083
Tomorrow, I would like
to meet the sheep.

578
00:37:49,083 --> 00:37:51,085
You know
I've never touched one?

579
00:37:51,085 --> 00:37:52,086
Never?

580
00:37:52,086 --> 00:37:53,087
Never.

581
00:37:53,087 --> 00:37:56,090
I've touched seals, though--
realseals.

582
00:37:56,090 --> 00:37:57,591
They're cool and slippery

583
00:37:57,591 --> 00:38:00,594
and they slide
through the water like fish.

584
00:38:00,594 --> 00:38:04,598
They can
cry and sing.

585
00:38:04,598 --> 00:38:07,601
Sometimes they bark,
a little like a dog.

586
00:38:07,601 --> 00:38:09,103
Woof, woof.

587
00:38:09,103 --> 00:38:10,604
(barking)

588
00:38:11,105 --> 00:38:12,606
Nick.

589
00:38:12,606 --> 00:38:15,609
Caleb:
I wish I could
touch a seal

590
00:38:15,609 --> 00:38:17,111
right now.

591
00:38:17,111 --> 00:38:19,613
Mmm... so do I.

592
00:38:32,626 --> 00:38:34,628
(insects chirping and buzzing)

593
00:38:34,628 --> 00:38:36,630
(water flowing)

594
00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:49,527
How was your walk?

595
00:38:49,527 --> 00:38:51,028
It's beautiful.

596
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:56,534
The wind dies down
and it's peaceful.

597
00:38:56,534 --> 00:38:58,035
You should take Nick

598
00:38:58,035 --> 00:39:00,538
if you go any distance
from the house.

599
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:06,544
I love the sound
of water.

600
00:39:06,544 --> 00:39:08,546
I expect.

601
00:39:08,546 --> 00:39:11,048
I expect you might
feel lonely here.

602
00:39:14,051 --> 00:39:16,053
Anyplace can be lonely.

603
00:39:17,555 --> 00:39:19,557
Sarah...

604
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,562
I want this to work

605
00:39:24,562 --> 00:39:27,064
but...

606
00:39:27,064 --> 00:39:28,566
I know.

607
00:39:30,067 --> 00:39:31,569
So do I.

608
00:39:58,496 --> 00:40:01,382
(humming "Billy Boy")

609
00:40:12,893 --> 00:40:14,395
I cut Caleb's hair

610
00:40:14,395 --> 00:40:15,396
most times.

611
00:40:15,896 --> 00:40:16,897
I'm sorry.

612
00:40:16,897 --> 00:40:18,399
Here, you do it.

613
00:40:18,399 --> 00:40:19,900
I'll watch.

614
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:23,404
I want Sarah to do it
this time.

615
00:40:23,404 --> 00:40:25,906
You do it.

616
00:40:31,912 --> 00:40:34,415
What's the name
of William's boat?

617
00:40:34,415 --> 00:40:36,917
It's called theKittiwake.

618
00:40:36,917 --> 00:40:38,419
It's gray and white.

619
00:40:38,919 --> 00:40:41,922
It's named after a little gull
that's found way offshore

620
00:40:41,922 --> 00:40:43,424
where William fishes.

621
00:40:45,426 --> 00:40:48,429
We have three aunts
who live next door.

622
00:40:48,429 --> 00:40:51,432
They wear silk dresses
and no shoes.

623
00:40:51,432 --> 00:40:54,935
They call themselves
"the unclaimed treasures."

624
00:40:54,935 --> 00:40:57,438
You'd like them.

625
00:40:57,438 --> 00:40:58,439
Yep.

626
00:40:58,439 --> 00:41:01,442
Does your brother
look like you?

627
00:41:01,442 --> 00:41:03,444
I'm afraid so.

628
00:41:03,444 --> 00:41:05,446
He's plain and tall.

629
00:41:08,949 --> 00:41:11,452
What are you doing
with the hair?

630
00:41:11,452 --> 00:41:13,454
It's for the birds.

631
00:41:13,454 --> 00:41:15,456
They'll use it
to build their nests.

632
00:41:15,456 --> 00:41:17,958
Later we can look for
nests of curls.

633
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,462
Sarah said later.

634
00:41:21,462 --> 00:41:23,964
That means she will stay.

635
00:41:42,399 --> 00:41:44,401
Sarah:
Anna...

636
00:41:51,909 --> 00:41:55,913
Here, this is for you.

637
00:41:55,913 --> 00:41:57,915
May I?

638
00:42:04,922 --> 00:42:07,424
When I was a little girl...

639
00:42:08,425 --> 00:42:12,930
when I was ten,
my mama died.

640
00:42:14,932 --> 00:42:18,936
My papa was away
for long days

641
00:42:18,936 --> 00:42:21,438
fishing after that.

642
00:42:21,438 --> 00:42:24,441
Sometimes I...

643
00:42:24,441 --> 00:42:27,444
I think he worked
harder than he had to

644
00:42:27,444 --> 00:42:31,448
because...
he was so sad.

645
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:38,455
I had the aunts who loved
me and William, but...

646
00:42:40,457 --> 00:42:43,961
it wasn't the same.

647
00:42:49,967 --> 00:42:52,469
I know.

648
00:42:52,469 --> 00:42:54,972
(footsteps approaching)

649
00:42:54,972 --> 00:42:56,974
You look alike--

650
00:42:56,974 --> 00:42:58,976
like family.

651
00:43:32,142 --> 00:43:34,645
(whimpering)

652
00:43:34,645 --> 00:43:36,647
(Anna crying)

653
00:43:36,647 --> 00:43:40,150
Anna:
No! No!

654
00:43:45,189 --> 00:43:47,608
No!

655
00:43:48,609 --> 00:43:50,611
Anna? Anna?

656
00:43:50,611 --> 00:43:52,112
It's a bad dream.

657
00:43:52,112 --> 00:43:53,614
Anna, wake up.
Wake up.

658
00:43:53,614 --> 00:43:55,115
Shh.

659
00:43:55,115 --> 00:43:56,617
Mama!

660
00:43:56,617 --> 00:43:58,619
Mama!

661
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:02,623
(sobbing)

662
00:44:17,137 --> 00:44:21,642
Your mama made this,
didn't she?

663
00:44:23,644 --> 00:44:25,646
This was my mama's.

664
00:44:29,149 --> 00:44:32,653
Maggie gave me
this shawl--

665
00:44:32,653 --> 00:44:35,155
Mama made for her.

666
00:44:35,656 --> 00:44:39,159
Papa put away all the
things that she loved--

667
00:44:39,159 --> 00:44:43,664
quilts, her picture.

668
00:44:43,664 --> 00:44:46,166
Papa doesn't understand.

669
00:45:05,185 --> 00:45:07,688
(Seal meowing)

670
00:45:16,697 --> 00:45:18,198
Go on.

671
00:45:22,202 --> 00:45:23,704
She all right?

672
00:45:25,205 --> 00:45:29,209
She's wrapped
in her mother's shawl.

673
00:45:29,209 --> 00:45:32,212
I don't know
what to say to her.

674
00:45:32,212 --> 00:45:36,717
When Katherine died,
Anna had these...

675
00:45:36,717 --> 00:45:38,719
Nightmares.

676
00:45:38,719 --> 00:45:40,721
Every night.

677
00:45:40,721 --> 00:45:43,223
She'd hang onto me
for an hour.

678
00:45:43,223 --> 00:45:45,726
When I'd let her go
she'd cry again.

679
00:45:45,726 --> 00:45:47,728
Sound asleep...

680
00:45:47,728 --> 00:45:52,232
mournful, abandoned,
terrible sound.

681
00:45:52,232 --> 00:45:56,236
She's better now.

682
00:46:02,242 --> 00:46:04,244
Katherine's not coming back

683
00:46:04,244 --> 00:46:07,214
no matter how much
you and the children

684
00:46:07,214 --> 00:46:10,717
want her to,
Jacob.

685
00:46:16,723 --> 00:46:18,225
Perhaps...

686
00:46:20,727 --> 00:46:22,229
perhaps it's a mistake

687
00:46:22,229 --> 00:46:25,232
to deprive the children
of their memories.

688
00:46:25,232 --> 00:46:26,650
That's enough!

689
00:46:28,152 --> 00:46:31,655
What do you know about it?

690
00:46:44,168 --> 00:46:47,671
Katherine meant for her things
to be used and loved.

691
00:46:47,671 --> 00:46:48,672
I said no.

692
00:46:48,672 --> 00:46:49,673
She's dead, Jacob.

693
00:46:49,673 --> 00:46:51,175
The children are alive.

694
00:46:51,175 --> 00:46:52,676
They need the connection to her.

695
00:46:52,676 --> 00:46:55,679
You asked for someone
who would make a difference.

696
00:46:55,679 --> 00:46:58,632
Cutting their hair,
teaching them to cook

697
00:46:58,632 --> 00:47:00,133
singing with them

698
00:47:00,133 --> 00:47:02,636
helping them
with their schoolwork.

699
00:47:02,636 --> 00:47:04,137
This is a help to me.

700
00:47:04,137 --> 00:47:05,639
It's all I want.

701
00:47:05,639 --> 00:47:08,108
I cannot make a difference
until you come to peace

702
00:47:08,108 --> 00:47:09,610
with Katherine's death.

703
00:47:09,610 --> 00:47:12,029
This is not your business.

704
00:47:12,029 --> 00:47:14,031
The past steps on the heels
of the present

705
00:47:14,031 --> 00:47:15,532
whether or not you like it.

706
00:47:16,033 --> 00:47:18,035
In this matter
you will do as I want, Sarah.

707
00:47:18,035 --> 00:47:19,536
And you are not to encourage

708
00:47:19,536 --> 00:47:21,038
the children
otherwise.

709
00:47:21,038 --> 00:47:23,040
We will do what is right.

710
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:26,543
What is right in my house

711
00:47:26,543 --> 00:47:29,046
is what I say is right.

712
00:47:55,072 --> 00:47:56,573
(horse whinnying)

713
00:48:08,085 --> 00:48:10,087
(door closing)

714
00:48:41,568 --> 00:48:44,571
(door closing)

715
00:48:58,585 --> 00:49:01,088
I did it for Anna.

716
00:49:02,089 --> 00:49:05,092
I know you're angry
and I'm sorry for that

717
00:49:05,092 --> 00:49:07,094
but I'm not sorry
I did it.

718
00:49:07,094 --> 00:49:09,596
I'm sure of that.

719
00:49:30,117 --> 00:49:34,121
(fiddle playing lively tune)

720
00:50:05,652 --> 00:50:08,155
Anna:
Come on, Caleb,
I see Rose.

721
00:50:23,587 --> 00:50:27,007
Jacob, what have you told
people about me?

722
00:50:27,007 --> 00:50:30,010
Matthew and Maggie
know, of course.

723
00:50:30,010 --> 00:50:31,011
And the others?

724
00:50:31,011 --> 00:50:34,431
Jacob:
They've been told
you're visiting

725
00:50:34,431 --> 00:50:36,433
from the east
for a month.

726
00:50:36,433 --> 00:50:37,851
Old family friend.

727
00:50:37,851 --> 00:50:40,353
You're such a fool, Jacob.

728
00:50:40,353 --> 00:50:44,357
Not a soul here believes
I'm an old family friend.

729
00:50:44,357 --> 00:50:45,859
Matthew:
Jacob...

730
00:50:45,859 --> 00:50:48,361
Over here.

731
00:50:48,361 --> 00:50:50,864
This way.

732
00:50:52,866 --> 00:50:55,869
Sarah, this is Matthew,
Matthew Grant.

733
00:50:56,369 --> 00:50:56,870
Pleasure.

734
00:50:57,370 --> 00:50:58,371
Hello.

735
00:50:58,371 --> 00:50:59,873
This is Maggie,
Sarah.

736
00:50:59,873 --> 00:51:01,374
Hello.

737
00:51:01,374 --> 00:51:02,375
Hello, Maggie.

738
00:51:02,375 --> 00:51:05,879
Jacob has told people
I'm an old family friend.

739
00:51:05,879 --> 00:51:07,881
Somehow I don't think
they believe it.

740
00:51:08,381 --> 00:51:09,382
Somehow I think
you're right.

741
00:51:09,382 --> 00:51:10,884
Come sit here
with us.

742
00:51:13,887 --> 00:51:16,389
These people aren't
really unfriendly, Sarah.

743
00:51:16,389 --> 00:51:18,391
They protect
those they love.

744
00:51:18,391 --> 00:51:22,395
Yes, those alive
and those dead.

745
00:51:22,395 --> 00:51:27,901
We don't live very far
away, you know, Matthew and I.

746
00:51:27,901 --> 00:51:29,903
We are the closest farm.

747
00:51:29,903 --> 00:51:31,905
Sometimes when
I walk at night

748
00:51:31,905 --> 00:51:33,907
I imagine I can
see your light.

749
00:51:33,907 --> 00:51:36,409
Jacob:
Sarah Wheaton...

750
00:51:36,409 --> 00:51:37,911
The Parkleys.

751
00:51:37,911 --> 00:51:39,412
We'll be at your...

752
00:51:39,412 --> 00:51:40,914
at Jacob's house

753
00:51:40,914 --> 00:51:41,915
for the harvest.

754
00:51:42,415 --> 00:51:43,416
Good.

755
00:51:43,416 --> 00:51:47,420
Mavis Ridley,
Sarah Wheaton.

756
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:48,922
Hello.

757
00:51:49,923 --> 00:51:51,424
That's Mavis.

758
00:51:51,424 --> 00:51:52,926
She likes Papa.

759
00:51:52,926 --> 00:51:56,930
She invites him to
dinner all the time.

760
00:51:56,930 --> 00:52:00,433
Sarah, we practiced.

761
00:52:00,433 --> 00:52:02,435
Excuse me.

762
00:52:03,937 --> 00:52:05,939
Come on.

763
00:52:41,725 --> 00:52:44,728
Papa, Jess took Sarah away.

764
00:52:44,728 --> 00:52:48,231
It's called cutting in, Caleb.

765
00:52:48,231 --> 00:52:49,232
You cut in.

766
00:52:49,232 --> 00:52:51,234
Take Sarah back.

767
00:52:51,234 --> 00:52:54,237
I'd say
Jess looks quite smitten.

768
00:53:27,854 --> 00:53:29,856
Thank you, Jess.

769
00:53:29,856 --> 00:53:33,360
Now I must dance
with an old family friend.

770
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:09,162
Straight, Sarah--
keep contact.

771
00:54:09,162 --> 00:54:10,664
Don't let Ben
take the bit...

772
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:12,666
or he'll go
back to the barn.

773
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:15,168
Few days, we'll plow
up some more grass

774
00:54:15,168 --> 00:54:16,670
for next year's
planting.

775
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:18,171
The gang plow...

776
00:54:18,171 --> 00:54:20,674
Matthew and Maggie'll
come with the horses.

777
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:21,675
Whoa!

778
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:23,176
I want to do
that, too.

779
00:54:23,176 --> 00:54:25,679
You want to do
everything.

780
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:29,182
(panting):
Drive a wagon,
ride a horse...

781
00:54:29,182 --> 00:54:31,685
so I can go into
town by myself.

782
00:54:34,688 --> 00:54:36,189
What are you looking at?

783
00:54:36,189 --> 00:54:37,190
(laughs)

784
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:41,194
Is it so strange
to see a woman behind a plow?

785
00:54:41,194 --> 00:54:44,197
Surely Katherine
knew how to do this.

786
00:54:44,197 --> 00:54:46,700
Katherine...

787
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:48,702
She grew up on a farm.

788
00:54:48,702 --> 00:54:52,205
It was like breathing
to her, all the work.

789
00:54:55,208 --> 00:54:57,210
I'd known her all her life.

790
00:54:57,210 --> 00:55:01,715
Then one day
we were married, and...

791
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:04,217
it was as if we'd
always been married.

792
00:55:04,217 --> 00:55:07,721
What about you?

793
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:10,223
You must have had someone--

794
00:55:10,223 --> 00:55:12,726
A man who felt that way
about you.

795
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:14,227
(sighs)

796
00:55:14,227 --> 00:55:16,229
Ayuh.

797
00:55:16,229 --> 00:55:20,233
I wouldn't marry him
for the same reason.

798
00:55:20,233 --> 00:55:23,236
Everyone expected it.

799
00:55:23,236 --> 00:55:27,657
Well, we'd known each other
for so long, he thought...

800
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:36,499
He thought he knew
everything I was thinking.

801
00:55:39,502 --> 00:55:43,006
That's the way it was...
with Katherine.

802
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:46,009
I know.

803
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:49,512
I loved Katherine, Sarah.

804
00:55:50,513 --> 00:55:53,466
You still do, Jacob.

805
00:56:05,478 --> 00:56:08,982
Sarah:
I think these lambs need names,
don't you?

806
00:56:08,982 --> 00:56:13,987
How about Harriet,
after one of the aunts, and...

807
00:56:13,987 --> 00:56:15,488
that little one
over there

808
00:56:15,488 --> 00:56:17,490
with the black face
will be Mattie.

809
00:56:17,490 --> 00:56:18,992
She reminds me
of her-- her walk

810
00:56:18,992 --> 00:56:20,493
her steady eye.

811
00:56:20,493 --> 00:56:23,496
And that little one
over there will be Lu.

812
00:56:23,496 --> 00:56:28,501
Caleb:
♪ Sumer is icumen in,
loudly sing "cuckoo" ♪

813
00:56:28,501 --> 00:56:30,503
♪ Groweth seed
and bloweth mead... ♪

814
00:56:30,503 --> 00:56:32,505
Oh, I'm hot.
What do you say?

815
00:56:32,505 --> 00:56:35,008
Shall we be wicked
and go swimming?

816
00:56:35,008 --> 00:56:36,509
Swim? Swim where?

817
00:56:36,509 --> 00:56:38,511
We don't know how to swim.

818
00:56:38,511 --> 00:56:40,013
You don't know
how to swim?

819
00:56:40,013 --> 00:56:42,515
Well, come on!
I'll teach you
in the pond.

820
00:56:42,515 --> 00:56:44,017
Come on!

821
00:56:44,017 --> 00:56:46,019
(all laughing loudly)

822
00:56:48,021 --> 00:56:50,023
(laughing)

823
00:56:52,525 --> 00:56:54,527
(yells)

824
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:56,529
(children laughing)

825
00:56:59,032 --> 00:57:01,034
Come on.

826
00:57:05,038 --> 00:57:07,040
I drown every time.

827
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:08,541
Sarah:
Look, you just take

828
00:57:08,541 --> 00:57:10,043
a big, deep breath
and hold it

829
00:57:10,043 --> 00:57:12,045
and you'll float
like a balloon. Watch.

830
00:57:18,051 --> 00:57:19,552
That's what whales do, Caleb.

831
00:57:19,552 --> 00:57:22,055
Is this like the sea, Sarah?

832
00:57:22,055 --> 00:57:23,556
Oh, goodness, no.

833
00:57:23,556 --> 00:57:25,058
The sea is salt...

834
00:57:25,058 --> 00:57:27,560
it stretches
as far as you can see...

835
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:32,065
gleams like sun on glass,
and there are waves.

836
00:57:32,065 --> 00:57:34,067
Like this?

837
00:57:34,067 --> 00:57:37,070
(all laughing)

838
00:57:48,081 --> 00:57:49,082
Shh...

839
00:57:49,082 --> 00:57:50,583
Shh...

840
00:58:00,093 --> 00:58:02,095
Anna:
Papa...

841
00:58:03,596 --> 00:58:05,598
I dreamed
a perfect dream, Papa.

842
00:58:05,598 --> 00:58:08,601
I dreamed the field
had turned into a sea

843
00:58:08,601 --> 00:58:11,104
that gleamed
like the sun on glass.

844
00:58:11,104 --> 00:58:15,108
I dreamed Sarah was happy.

845
00:58:24,617 --> 00:58:28,121
Caleb:
Is this for William--
the prairie?

846
00:58:28,121 --> 00:58:30,123
Sarah:
Yeah.

847
00:58:30,123 --> 00:58:31,624
There's something wrong
with it.

848
00:58:31,624 --> 00:58:33,626
Something's missing.

849
00:58:33,626 --> 00:58:35,128
But what?

850
00:58:36,629 --> 00:58:39,132
Is that a camel?

851
00:58:39,132 --> 00:58:41,134
Sarah:
That is a cow.

852
00:58:41,134 --> 00:58:42,635
Ah.

853
00:58:43,136 --> 00:58:45,638
Couldn't tell
by the ears.

854
00:58:45,638 --> 00:58:47,640
Caleb:
"Windmill" was
my first word.

855
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:49,142
My first long word.

856
00:58:49,142 --> 00:58:51,144
Papa told me so.

857
00:58:51,144 --> 00:58:52,645
Mine was "daffodil."

858
00:58:52,645 --> 00:58:55,648
What was yours, Sarah?

859
00:58:55,648 --> 00:58:57,650
"Dune."

860
00:58:57,650 --> 00:58:59,152
"Dune?"

861
00:58:59,152 --> 00:59:01,154
At home we have rock cliffs
by the sea

862
00:59:01,654 --> 00:59:04,657
but William and I found a sandy
place, and we made a dune.

863
00:59:05,158 --> 00:59:08,161
When we were little,
we'd slide down into the water.

864
00:59:08,161 --> 00:59:09,662
We have no
dunes here.

865
00:59:11,164 --> 00:59:12,165
Yes, we do.

866
00:59:12,165 --> 00:59:13,166
We do?

867
00:59:13,166 --> 00:59:15,168
We do?
Jacob:
Come on.

868
00:59:16,669 --> 00:59:18,171
Come on.

869
00:59:21,174 --> 00:59:23,676
(barks)

870
00:59:23,676 --> 00:59:26,179
(Nick barking)

871
00:59:26,179 --> 00:59:28,181
Sarah...

872
00:59:28,181 --> 00:59:31,184
our dune.

873
00:59:31,184 --> 00:59:32,185
It looks high up!

874
00:59:32,185 --> 00:59:34,187
Are you scared, Sarah?

875
00:59:34,187 --> 00:59:36,189
Scared? Scared?

876
00:59:36,189 --> 00:59:37,690
You bet I'm not scared.

877
00:59:37,690 --> 00:59:39,692
(Sarah and children laughing)

878
00:59:39,692 --> 00:59:41,194
Jacob:
If you do it

879
00:59:41,194 --> 00:59:42,695
I'll teach you
to ride.

880
00:59:42,695 --> 00:59:43,696
You'll teach me

881
00:59:44,197 --> 00:59:45,698
to ride anyway.

882
00:59:45,698 --> 00:59:47,700
(children laughing)

883
00:59:49,702 --> 00:59:51,704
(sighs)

884
00:59:51,704 --> 00:59:53,406
Anna:
Jump, Sarah!

885
00:59:54,791 --> 00:59:55,792
Whoo!

886
00:59:55,792 --> 00:59:56,793
(laughing)

887
00:59:56,793 --> 00:59:58,294
Caleb:
Is it a good dune?

888
00:59:58,294 --> 01:00:01,297
Oh, it's a fine dune!

889
01:00:01,297 --> 01:00:04,300
Go on. Climb up.

890
01:00:05,301 --> 01:00:06,803
That's right.

891
01:00:06,803 --> 01:00:08,304
Big jump.

892
01:00:08,304 --> 01:00:09,806
You can do it.

893
01:00:11,307 --> 01:00:14,310
(laughter)

894
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:17,280
Now Anna.

895
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:18,781
Caleb:
Jump, Anna.

896
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:19,782
Whoo!

897
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:23,286
(laughing)

898
01:00:23,286 --> 01:00:24,787
Now you, Jacob.

899
01:00:24,787 --> 01:00:26,789
No, no.

900
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:29,292
Are you scared, Papa?

901
01:00:30,793 --> 01:00:32,295
(Nick barking)

902
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:33,296
Anna:
Jump, Papa!

903
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:34,797
Caleb:
Papa, jump!

904
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:36,299
(laughing)

905
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:39,302
(all laughing)

906
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:43,806
Caleb:
I want to go again.

907
01:00:43,806 --> 01:00:45,308
Anna:
So do I!

908
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:46,809
(laughing)

909
01:00:48,811 --> 01:00:51,314
Anna:
Whoo!

910
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:54,817
(children laughing
and hooting)

911
01:01:09,332 --> 01:01:11,834
Jacob... coffee?

912
01:01:19,842 --> 01:01:22,345
Nice difference you've made.

913
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:24,347
Coffee, I mean.

914
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:31,354
Jacob?

915
01:01:31,354 --> 01:01:32,855
Yes?

916
01:01:32,855 --> 01:01:34,857
Thank you for the dune.

917
01:01:34,857 --> 01:01:38,361
Oh, well, it wasn't a big thing.

918
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:41,364
It was a big thing to me.

919
01:01:43,282 --> 01:01:46,786
Then I'm glad.
You're welcome.

920
01:01:46,786 --> 01:01:48,788
(Nick barking)

921
01:01:51,791 --> 01:01:53,793
(horse neighing)

922
01:01:54,293 --> 01:01:56,295
Hello!

923
01:01:58,297 --> 01:02:00,299
Whoa! Whoa!

924
01:02:01,801 --> 01:02:03,302
It's a grand day,
isn't it?

925
01:02:03,302 --> 01:02:05,805
Ah, yeah.
It's wicked hot.

926
01:02:05,805 --> 01:02:08,307
Oh, God...

927
01:02:08,307 --> 01:02:09,809
Gently.

928
01:02:09,809 --> 01:02:13,312
I'm getting heavier
every day.

929
01:02:13,312 --> 01:02:14,313
Jacob.

930
01:02:15,314 --> 01:02:17,817
The light, Maggie--
I thank you for it.

931
01:02:18,317 --> 01:02:19,819
You noticed.
Yes.

932
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:22,822
Matthew:
Maggie...

933
01:02:22,822 --> 01:02:25,324
the chickens.

934
01:02:25,324 --> 01:02:27,326
Maggie:
They are for you,
Sarah...

935
01:02:27,326 --> 01:02:29,829
for eating.

936
01:02:40,339 --> 01:02:41,841
Sarah:
Aren't they dear?

937
01:02:41,841 --> 01:02:43,843
Those chickens
won't be for eating.

938
01:02:43,843 --> 01:02:46,345
Maggie:
These are for your
flower garden.

939
01:02:46,345 --> 01:02:47,847
My garden?

940
01:02:47,847 --> 01:02:49,348
Mm-hmm.

941
01:02:49,348 --> 01:02:50,850
Oh...

942
01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:52,852
Maggie,
you shouldn't be lifting.

943
01:02:52,852 --> 01:02:55,855
I'm fine. It's not due
for another month.

944
01:02:55,855 --> 01:03:00,860
Zinnias, marigolds
and wild fever-few.

945
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:04,363
Please do have
a flower garden.

946
01:03:04,363 --> 01:03:06,365
At Mama's grave

947
01:03:06,365 --> 01:03:09,368
we always put flowers there
that wilt and die.

948
01:03:09,368 --> 01:03:12,371
Papa doesn't want us
to plant flowers there.

949
01:03:12,371 --> 01:03:14,874
I don't know why.

950
01:03:14,874 --> 01:03:18,578
But it would be
a good thing

951
01:03:18,578 --> 01:03:19,579
wouldn't it, Sarah?

952
01:03:19,579 --> 01:03:22,031
Yes. It would be
a very good thing.

953
01:03:22,031 --> 01:03:25,001
Anna, would you please
bring us some lemonade.

954
01:03:40,016 --> 01:03:42,518
It's not what you
expected, is it?

955
01:03:42,518 --> 01:03:43,519
(laughs)

956
01:03:43,519 --> 01:03:45,521
Well, in some ways, it is.

957
01:03:45,521 --> 01:03:48,524
But there are some things
I never reckoned for.

958
01:03:48,524 --> 01:03:50,026
Katherine.

959
01:03:52,528 --> 01:03:55,531
She's here, you know?

960
01:03:55,531 --> 01:03:59,035
I can feel her here.

961
01:03:59,035 --> 01:04:03,039
Sometimes, I... I think
I can smell her scent.

962
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:05,541
I know.

963
01:04:07,043 --> 01:04:10,546
Jacob... can't let her go.

964
01:04:12,048 --> 01:04:13,549
And the children?

965
01:04:13,549 --> 01:04:17,553
Well, Caleb...
Caleb has so much room for me.

966
01:04:17,553 --> 01:04:20,056
Anna's trying.

967
01:04:20,056 --> 01:04:22,558
But it's not enough.

968
01:04:26,562 --> 01:04:28,064
Shouldn't we plant
the flowers?

969
01:04:28,064 --> 01:04:29,565
Ayuh. Right now.

970
01:04:34,203 --> 01:04:36,639
There is something
about a garden.

971
01:04:36,639 --> 01:04:38,374
It's very dirty.

972
01:04:38,374 --> 01:04:39,375
(both laughing)

973
01:04:39,375 --> 01:04:41,878
Soon you can drive
your wagon to my house

974
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:43,379
and I will give you more.

975
01:04:43,379 --> 01:04:44,881
I have tansy.

976
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:47,884
Ah, I had tansy in Maine.

977
01:04:47,884 --> 01:04:50,386
But I've never
driven a farm wagon.

978
01:04:50,386 --> 01:04:52,388
Jacob can teach you.

979
01:04:52,388 --> 01:04:53,890
So can I.

980
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:02,732
Maggie brought us
these flowers, Jacob.

981
01:05:02,732 --> 01:05:04,734
It's my garden.

982
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:12,241
It's nice you're here, Sarah.

983
01:05:12,241 --> 01:05:16,746
You must miss your friends
and family at home.

984
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:19,749
Well, there's always
something to miss...

985
01:05:19,749 --> 01:05:22,251
no matter where you are.

986
01:05:27,673 --> 01:05:30,676
You will come?
I'll come. Soon.

987
01:05:30,676 --> 01:05:32,678
Before the baby.

988
01:05:32,678 --> 01:05:34,680
Bye-bye.
Bye.

989
01:05:40,686 --> 01:05:44,190
So, now, what are we going
to name these chickens?

990
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:47,193
I knew it-- These chickens
won'tbe for eating.

991
01:05:47,193 --> 01:05:49,195
This one's "Ayuh."

992
01:05:49,195 --> 01:05:50,696
And that one's "Dune."

993
01:05:52,198 --> 01:05:54,200
And that one's "Woolly Ragwort."

994
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:55,701
(children laughing)

995
01:05:57,703 --> 01:06:00,706
Okay, come on...
get some supper.

996
01:06:06,712 --> 01:06:12,718
Children:
♪ Sumer is icumen in,
loudly sing "cuckoo"... ♪

997
01:06:12,718 --> 01:06:14,720
Shoo! Shoo! Go on!

998
01:06:18,724 --> 01:06:21,227
Sarah:
Wash your hands,
all right?

999
01:06:28,751 --> 01:06:29,752
Thank you.

1000
01:06:31,754 --> 01:06:33,756
Can Nick come to town?

1001
01:06:33,756 --> 01:06:38,260
He'd be happier here
with gophers to chase.

1002
01:06:45,768 --> 01:06:47,770
Come on, Nick.

1003
01:06:47,770 --> 01:06:49,271
(Nick barks)

1004
01:07:00,282 --> 01:07:03,786
Did you ever have
a dog, Sarah?

1005
01:07:03,786 --> 01:07:04,787
William did.

1006
01:07:04,787 --> 01:07:06,789
Her name was Gracie.

1007
01:07:06,789 --> 01:07:09,291
Sometimes she went
fishing with him

1008
01:07:09,291 --> 01:07:11,293
but she barked
at gulls.

1009
01:07:11,293 --> 01:07:13,796
Papa did when
he was little.

1010
01:07:13,796 --> 01:07:15,297
Ask him.

1011
01:07:15,297 --> 01:07:16,298
Ask him what?

1012
01:07:16,298 --> 01:07:19,301
Ask him what the
dog's name was.

1013
01:07:19,301 --> 01:07:20,803
All right.

1014
01:07:20,803 --> 01:07:22,304
What was his name?

1015
01:07:22,304 --> 01:07:23,305
Guess.

1016
01:07:23,305 --> 01:07:24,807
All right.

1017
01:07:24,807 --> 01:07:26,308
Rex?

1018
01:07:26,308 --> 01:07:29,311
No? Well, then...

1019
01:07:29,311 --> 01:07:30,813
Rover?

1020
01:07:30,813 --> 01:07:33,315
No. Guess!

1021
01:07:33,315 --> 01:07:36,318
Um, Willy?

1022
01:07:36,318 --> 01:07:38,320
Mortimer.

1023
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:39,321
Henry.

1024
01:07:39,321 --> 01:07:40,322
(kids laughing)

1025
01:07:40,322 --> 01:07:41,323
Spot.

1026
01:07:41,323 --> 01:07:43,826
Jacob:
No, Sarah. Guess.

1027
01:07:43,826 --> 01:07:46,328
Uh, Mike?

1028
01:07:46,328 --> 01:07:47,329
Tom?

1029
01:08:02,845 --> 01:08:05,848
Sarah, the list.

1030
01:08:05,848 --> 01:08:07,349
Good morning, Mrs. Parkley.

1031
01:08:07,349 --> 01:08:09,351
Hello.

1032
01:08:09,351 --> 01:08:12,855
I was wondering whether
you have any canned peaches.

1033
01:08:12,855 --> 01:08:14,857
Yes, I have those.

1034
01:08:14,857 --> 01:08:18,360
What about those
homemade ones over there

1035
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:19,862
in the glass jars?

1036
01:08:19,862 --> 01:08:21,363
Fine.

1037
01:08:22,364 --> 01:08:24,867
Sarah, Mrs. Parkley's peaches
are terrible.

1038
01:08:24,867 --> 01:08:27,870
Doesn't matter.

1039
01:08:27,870 --> 01:08:29,371
These are
my peaches, Miss...

1040
01:08:29,371 --> 01:08:30,372
Sarah.

1041
01:08:30,372 --> 01:08:31,373
Sarah.

1042
01:08:31,373 --> 01:08:32,374
Well, they
look wonderful.

1043
01:08:32,875 --> 01:08:33,375
I'll take two.

1044
01:08:33,876 --> 01:08:35,327
Oh, well, good.

1045
01:08:35,327 --> 01:08:36,829
Caleb:
Listen, Sarah.

1046
01:08:36,829 --> 01:08:38,330
(blows harmonica)

1047
01:08:43,836 --> 01:08:46,338
Anna, do you like
to draw?

1048
01:08:46,839 --> 01:08:48,340
I don't know how.

1049
01:08:48,340 --> 01:08:49,842
Would you like
to try?

1050
01:08:49,842 --> 01:08:50,843
Yes.

1051
01:08:50,843 --> 01:08:52,344
Sarah, we have fresh oranges.

1052
01:08:52,344 --> 01:08:56,348
Good. I'll take
this sketch book

1053
01:08:56,348 --> 01:08:57,850
and these, too.

1054
01:08:57,850 --> 01:08:59,852
And one more thing.

1055
01:09:02,688 --> 01:09:05,124
(Caleb blowing harmonica)

1056
01:09:16,051 --> 01:09:19,054
Aren't we going to stop
at Mama's grave?

1057
01:09:19,054 --> 01:09:20,055
Not today.

1058
01:09:20,055 --> 01:09:22,558
Jacob, it's all right
if Anna wants to.

1059
01:09:22,558 --> 01:09:23,559
No.

1060
01:09:23,559 --> 01:09:24,560
I don't mind,
really.

1061
01:09:25,060 --> 01:09:25,561
It's early.

1062
01:09:26,061 --> 01:09:27,563
We can stop
if you want to.

1063
01:09:27,563 --> 01:09:29,565
No! We'll do it
another day.

1064
01:09:36,071 --> 01:09:38,073
Papa, listen.

1065
01:09:40,492 --> 01:09:41,994
You'll be
sorry for that.

1066
01:09:41,994 --> 01:09:44,997
Maybe. At least
we'll know where he is.

1067
01:09:44,997 --> 01:09:46,498
That's fine, Caleb.

1068
01:09:46,498 --> 01:09:48,000
Are there ever any geese here?

1069
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,502
Sometimes flocks
of them come in.

1070
01:09:50,502 --> 01:09:52,504
The next day,
they're gone.

1071
01:09:52,504 --> 01:09:54,006
Going somewhere.

1072
01:09:54,006 --> 01:09:56,008
(Nick barks)

1073
01:09:56,008 --> 01:09:57,509
Oh, Nick! Oh, Nick!

1074
01:09:57,509 --> 01:09:58,510
Nick!

1075
01:09:58,510 --> 01:09:59,511
"Guess."

1076
01:09:59,511 --> 01:10:02,514
The dog's name was Guess.

1077
01:10:02,514 --> 01:10:03,515
Is that right, Anna?

1078
01:10:04,016 --> 01:10:05,017
Jacob:
Smart woman

1079
01:10:05,017 --> 01:10:06,518
but crazy, you know?

1080
01:10:06,518 --> 01:10:09,021
She bought
Mrs. Parkley's peaches.

1081
01:10:09,021 --> 01:10:10,522
(kids laughing)

1082
01:10:14,026 --> 01:10:16,528
(chuckling)

1083
01:10:24,036 --> 01:10:25,537
Whoa!

1084
01:10:28,040 --> 01:10:29,541
Jacob, what's wrong?

1085
01:10:29,541 --> 01:10:30,542
Vultures.

1086
01:10:30,542 --> 01:10:32,044
Something's dead.

1087
01:10:33,545 --> 01:10:35,047
Come on!

1088
01:10:39,501 --> 01:10:40,920
Jacob, it's Mattie!

1089
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:42,421
Do something.

1090
01:10:42,421 --> 01:10:44,423
Coyote got her.

1091
01:10:44,423 --> 01:10:45,925
What? In the middle
of the day

1092
01:10:45,925 --> 01:10:46,926
while we were in town?

1093
01:10:46,926 --> 01:10:48,928
Bones will be picked
clean by morning.

1094
01:10:48,928 --> 01:10:49,929
No! Shoo!

1095
01:10:49,929 --> 01:10:51,430
Go on! Go away! Shoo!

1096
01:10:51,430 --> 01:10:52,431
Go on! Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!

1097
01:10:52,431 --> 01:10:53,933
They're doing their job.

1098
01:10:53,933 --> 01:10:54,934
Do something, Jacob!

1099
01:10:54,934 --> 01:10:55,935
Do something!

1100
01:10:55,935 --> 01:10:57,436
The sheep have got
to be out.

1101
01:10:57,436 --> 01:10:59,438
They've got to eat!
This happens!

1102
01:10:59,438 --> 01:11:01,941
You can't let yourself
get attached.

1103
01:11:26,966 --> 01:11:28,467
Hungry?

1104
01:11:34,974 --> 01:11:37,476
The barn's a good place
to think.

1105
01:11:39,478 --> 01:11:40,980
Space.

1106
01:11:44,483 --> 01:11:47,486
You would think,
wouldn't you

1107
01:11:47,486 --> 01:11:49,488
that in this big land

1108
01:11:49,488 --> 01:11:53,993
there'd be enough space
for everyone

1109
01:11:53,993 --> 01:11:58,497
but there isn't...

1110
01:11:58,497 --> 01:11:59,999
is there?

1111
01:12:18,517 --> 01:12:20,019
(thunder rumbling)

1112
01:12:22,021 --> 01:12:25,024
Are those your overalls?

1113
01:12:25,024 --> 01:12:27,026
I borrowed them
from your father.

1114
01:12:27,026 --> 01:12:29,528
Women don't wear overalls.

1115
01:12:29,528 --> 01:12:31,030
This one does.

1116
01:12:31,030 --> 01:12:32,531
The roof needs fixing.

1117
01:12:32,531 --> 01:12:34,533
Caleb, better get
the sheep in now.

1118
01:12:34,533 --> 01:12:36,035
I don't like
the look of this.

1119
01:12:36,035 --> 01:12:38,037
Anna, bring some
provisions to the barn.

1120
01:12:38,037 --> 01:12:41,040
I'll get the roof fixed
before the storm comes.

1121
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:42,041
I'll help you.

1122
01:12:42,041 --> 01:12:43,542
I've done it before.

1123
01:12:43,542 --> 01:12:45,044
I know about roofs.

1124
01:12:45,044 --> 01:12:46,045
I'm a good carpenter.

1125
01:12:46,045 --> 01:12:47,046
Remember? I told you.

1126
01:12:47,046 --> 01:12:49,048
(cow lowing)

1127
01:12:50,049 --> 01:12:51,050
Caleb, the sheep.

1128
01:12:51,550 --> 01:12:53,552
Anna, you know what to get.

1129
01:12:53,552 --> 01:12:55,054
Then help Caleb.

1130
01:12:59,058 --> 01:13:00,059
You fast?

1131
01:13:00,059 --> 01:13:02,061
I'm fast
and I'm very good.

1132
01:13:02,061 --> 01:13:03,562
Those my overalls?

1133
01:13:04,563 --> 01:13:08,567
Caleb:
Why does she want to wear
Papa's overalls?

1134
01:13:08,567 --> 01:13:11,070
Did Mama ever wear overalls?

1135
01:13:11,070 --> 01:13:12,571
Hurry! Hurry, Caleb!

1136
01:13:12,571 --> 01:13:14,073
(dog barks)

1137
01:13:17,576 --> 01:13:18,577
(dog barks)

1138
01:13:26,085 --> 01:13:27,586
Jacob:
Quickly, Sarah.

1139
01:13:27,586 --> 01:13:29,088
It's not safe up here.

1140
01:13:40,516 --> 01:13:42,017
Sarah, come
to the barn now!

1141
01:13:42,017 --> 01:13:43,018
You go on.

1142
01:13:43,018 --> 01:13:44,386
Seal, where are you?!

1143
01:13:44,386 --> 01:13:47,189
(animals bellowing)

1144
01:13:52,661 --> 01:13:54,163
Where's Sarah?

1145
01:13:56,665 --> 01:13:57,666
Sarah, where were you?

1146
01:13:57,666 --> 01:13:59,668
Are you all right?

1147
01:13:59,668 --> 01:14:00,669
Is Seal in here?

1148
01:14:00,669 --> 01:14:01,670
No.

1149
01:14:02,171 --> 01:14:03,172
Sarah, don't go
back out!

1150
01:14:03,172 --> 01:14:05,174
Sarah, no.

1151
01:14:05,174 --> 01:14:06,675
Papa!

1152
01:14:06,675 --> 01:14:08,677
Come back here!

1153
01:14:09,178 --> 01:14:11,180
Seal?! Seal?!

1154
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:12,681
Seal?!

1155
01:14:12,681 --> 01:14:13,682
Seal?!

1156
01:14:13,682 --> 01:14:14,683
Seal?!

1157
01:14:14,683 --> 01:14:15,684
What are you doing?!

1158
01:14:15,684 --> 01:14:16,685
Jacob, the chickens.

1159
01:14:16,685 --> 01:14:17,686
Seal?!

1160
01:14:17,686 --> 01:14:18,687
Sarah, come on.

1161
01:14:18,687 --> 01:14:20,689
Jacob, please!

1162
01:14:20,689 --> 01:14:21,690
Forget the cat.

1163
01:14:21,690 --> 01:14:23,192
We're going to
get killed.

1164
01:14:23,192 --> 01:14:24,193
We got to
get back.

1165
01:14:24,193 --> 01:14:25,194
Let me go!

1166
01:14:25,194 --> 01:14:26,695
Seal?!

1167
01:14:30,699 --> 01:14:31,700
(shrieks)

1168
01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:33,702
Sarah, are you all right?

1169
01:14:33,702 --> 01:14:35,704
(gasping)

1170
01:14:35,704 --> 01:14:38,207
Jacob:
Anna, go back.

1171
01:14:40,709 --> 01:14:42,211
Go back!

1172
01:14:42,211 --> 01:14:43,712
Anna:
Sarah!

1173
01:14:43,712 --> 01:14:46,715
Anna, where's Seal?
Do you know?

1174
01:14:46,715 --> 01:14:47,716
No!

1175
01:14:47,716 --> 01:14:50,219
I never should
have brought Seal!

1176
01:14:50,219 --> 01:14:52,221
I never should
have come here!

1177
01:14:52,221 --> 01:14:53,722
I didn't mean that!

1178
01:14:53,722 --> 01:14:55,724
Yes, you did!

1179
01:14:55,724 --> 01:14:58,727
I saw the train ticket
in the drawer by your bed!

1180
01:14:58,727 --> 01:15:01,730
You never meant to stay!

1181
01:15:01,730 --> 01:15:03,232
Anna, hurry!

1182
01:15:03,232 --> 01:15:05,734
Sarah, come on!

1183
01:15:31,443 --> 01:15:34,947
(chicken clucks)

1184
01:15:34,947 --> 01:15:37,449
(cow lows)

1185
01:15:37,449 --> 01:15:42,955
What colors are
seen in storms?

1186
01:15:42,955 --> 01:15:45,457
Blue and gray and green.

1187
01:15:45,457 --> 01:15:46,458
Why?

1188
01:15:46,959 --> 01:15:49,962
Now I know what's missing
from your drawing.

1189
01:15:49,962 --> 01:15:51,463
What do you mean?

1190
01:15:51,463 --> 01:15:53,465
Colors. Colors
of our sea.

1191
01:15:53,465 --> 01:15:55,467
Colors of our storms:

1192
01:15:55,467 --> 01:15:56,468
Blue and gray

1193
01:15:56,468 --> 01:15:58,470
and green.

1194
01:15:59,972 --> 01:16:01,974
(clattering)

1195
01:16:01,974 --> 01:16:04,476
Jacob?

1196
01:16:04,476 --> 01:16:07,980
That's hail.

1197
01:16:15,988 --> 01:16:20,993
(dog whines)

1198
01:16:20,993 --> 01:16:23,495
It looks like
sun on glass.

1199
01:16:30,002 --> 01:16:32,004
Oh, Jacob.

1200
01:16:51,523 --> 01:16:53,025
Everything dies.

1201
01:16:55,527 --> 01:16:57,029
Anna.

1202
01:17:02,034 --> 01:17:08,540
We'll plant
more flowers,
I promise.

1203
01:17:08,540 --> 01:17:10,542
(banging)

1204
01:17:15,998 --> 01:17:16,999
Sarah:
Jacob?

1205
01:17:20,502 --> 01:17:22,504
The crops?

1206
01:17:22,504 --> 01:17:26,508
Two fields are gone,
maybe another.

1207
01:17:26,508 --> 01:17:28,510
Oh, I'm sorry, Jacob.

1208
01:17:28,510 --> 01:17:30,012
Can you replant?

1209
01:17:30,012 --> 01:17:32,014
It's late.

1210
01:17:34,016 --> 01:17:35,517
Maybe.

1211
01:17:35,517 --> 01:17:37,519
Might have
to sell the sheep.

1212
01:17:37,519 --> 01:17:38,520
Sell the sheep?

1213
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:41,023
The sheep
are not pets, Sarah.

1214
01:17:42,024 --> 01:17:46,028
We live by them,
one way or another.

1215
01:17:46,028 --> 01:17:48,530
I know that, Jacob.

1216
01:17:48,530 --> 01:17:51,533
I just want to help.

1217
01:17:51,533 --> 01:17:53,535
How can I help?

1218
01:17:54,036 --> 01:17:55,037
We'll be all right.

1219
01:17:55,037 --> 01:17:56,538
We'll manage.

1220
01:18:00,542 --> 01:18:01,543
I have some money.

1221
01:18:02,044 --> 01:18:03,045
You're welcome to it.

1222
01:18:03,045 --> 01:18:04,046
No!

1223
01:18:04,046 --> 01:18:07,049
I don't need that.

1224
01:18:08,533 --> 01:18:10,936
You don't need anything, do you?

1225
01:18:10,936 --> 01:18:12,938
You don't need anyone.

1226
01:18:12,938 --> 01:18:14,856
You don't need.

1227
01:18:20,312 --> 01:18:22,814
You can't take
anything from anyone

1228
01:18:22,814 --> 01:18:25,817
because you're still
so filled with her.

1229
01:18:25,817 --> 01:18:27,819
Filled with Katherine.

1230
01:18:27,819 --> 01:18:29,321
There's no room
in your life for anyone.

1231
01:18:29,821 --> 01:18:31,823
There's no room for anyone
to make a difference.

1232
01:18:31,823 --> 01:18:32,824
There's no room

1233
01:18:32,824 --> 01:18:34,326
in your heart.

1234
01:18:34,326 --> 01:18:36,328
That's not true.

1235
01:18:36,328 --> 01:18:38,330
I wanted this to...

1236
01:18:38,330 --> 01:18:41,333
I'm doing the best I can.

1237
01:18:41,333 --> 01:18:42,834
Some things you
just can't make happen.

1238
01:18:42,834 --> 01:18:43,835
I know

1239
01:18:43,835 --> 01:18:45,837
but...

1240
01:18:45,837 --> 01:18:49,841
This isn't going to work, is it?

1241
01:18:58,266 --> 01:19:00,769
The children
are very fond of you, Sarah.

1242
01:19:00,769 --> 01:19:02,154
So am I.

1243
01:19:02,154 --> 01:19:04,055
It just...

1244
01:19:04,055 --> 01:19:07,058
Isn't going to work.

1245
01:19:22,040 --> 01:19:24,493
You got the worst
of the storm.

1246
01:19:24,493 --> 01:19:25,994
We hardly got wet.

1247
01:19:27,996 --> 01:19:29,498
Sarah?

1248
01:19:29,498 --> 01:19:30,499
Hmm?

1249
01:19:30,499 --> 01:19:33,001
Something isn't right.

1250
01:19:33,001 --> 01:19:35,504
I'm not right.

1251
01:19:35,504 --> 01:19:36,505
Matthew:
Sarah?

1252
01:19:41,009 --> 01:19:43,011
It's been so nice.

1253
01:19:43,011 --> 01:19:46,014
She brought out
all of Mama's things

1254
01:19:46,014 --> 01:19:48,517
and Papa didn't make
her put them away.

1255
01:19:48,517 --> 01:19:50,519
But the month
is almost over.

1256
01:19:50,519 --> 01:19:53,021
She's not going to stay?

1257
01:19:53,021 --> 01:19:54,523
Sarah:
Oh!

1258
01:19:54,523 --> 01:19:56,024
Seal...

1259
01:19:56,024 --> 01:19:58,026
Seal, you're all right.

1260
01:19:58,026 --> 01:20:00,028
Yeah, my girl.

1261
01:20:00,529 --> 01:20:02,030
Now that she's found Seal

1262
01:20:02,030 --> 01:20:04,533
she has everything
she needs to go home with.

1263
01:20:04,533 --> 01:20:07,536
Don't tell Caleb
I said that.

1264
01:20:07,536 --> 01:20:10,038
Are you sorry
she came?

1265
01:20:10,038 --> 01:20:11,039
No.

1266
01:20:11,039 --> 01:20:13,041
Neither am I.

1267
01:20:39,067 --> 01:20:42,070
We're going to Maggie's first,
and then where?

1268
01:20:42,070 --> 01:20:44,072
Well, first, you're
going to teach me

1269
01:20:44,072 --> 01:20:45,073
how to drive
this wagon.

1270
01:20:45,574 --> 01:20:51,079
The line, traces,
cooper, hame, collar.

1271
01:21:02,090 --> 01:21:04,593
Mama would like this.

1272
01:21:04,593 --> 01:21:06,094
Yes.

1273
01:21:06,094 --> 01:21:09,097
But, Anna, these flowers
aren't for her.

1274
01:21:09,097 --> 01:21:10,599
They're for you.

1275
01:21:10,599 --> 01:21:12,601
But it will
hurt Papa.

1276
01:21:12,601 --> 01:21:15,604
Not any more
than he's hurting now.

1277
01:21:18,607 --> 01:21:20,108
I'll tell him.

1278
01:21:20,108 --> 01:21:23,111
Are you going to leave us?

1279
01:21:23,111 --> 01:21:24,613
Oh, Anna...

1280
01:21:24,613 --> 01:21:27,115
I can't...

1281
01:21:30,118 --> 01:21:34,122
Your father wants
the kind of woman I can't be.

1282
01:21:34,122 --> 01:21:38,126
But you could try,
couldn't you?

1283
01:21:38,126 --> 01:21:40,629
For Caleb?

1284
01:21:46,635 --> 01:21:49,137
(sobbing)

1285
01:22:08,657 --> 01:22:10,659
Jacob?

1286
01:22:10,659 --> 01:22:13,161
I did something
you will not like.

1287
01:22:13,161 --> 01:22:15,664
Anna:
Wedid something
 you will not like.

1288
01:22:15,664 --> 01:22:18,617
We planted flowers
on Mama's grave.

1289
01:22:22,871 --> 01:22:24,205
It wasn't your place.

1290
01:22:24,205 --> 01:22:25,707
No, it wasn't.

1291
01:22:25,707 --> 01:22:27,709
It was your place.

1292
01:22:28,710 --> 01:22:30,128
Matthew:
Sarah!

1293
01:22:30,128 --> 01:22:32,130
Jacob!

1294
01:22:32,130 --> 01:22:34,633
(horse galloping)

1295
01:22:34,633 --> 01:22:36,134
Sarah, the baby.

1296
01:22:36,134 --> 01:22:37,636
It's too early.

1297
01:22:37,636 --> 01:22:39,137
The doctor's gone.

1298
01:22:39,137 --> 01:22:40,639
We'll come.

1299
01:22:48,146 --> 01:22:50,649
Caleb:
Will she die, Papa?

1300
01:22:50,649 --> 01:22:52,651
Will Maggie die
like Mama?

1301
01:22:52,651 --> 01:22:53,652
Caleb!

1302
01:22:53,652 --> 01:22:55,153
No, Caleb! No!

1303
01:23:00,659 --> 01:23:02,577
(gasping and groaning)

1304
01:23:07,082 --> 01:23:10,085
I don't know how
to do this, Sarah.

1305
01:23:10,085 --> 01:23:11,086
I know.

1306
01:23:11,086 --> 01:23:13,054
I don't how to, either.

1307
01:23:13,054 --> 01:23:14,472
And I'm too old.

1308
01:23:14,472 --> 01:23:16,474
Oh, no.

1309
01:23:16,474 --> 01:23:18,476
My mother was old
when she had me.

1310
01:23:18,476 --> 01:23:19,477
How old?

1311
01:23:19,477 --> 01:23:20,478
How old are you?

1312
01:23:20,478 --> 01:23:22,414
(laughing)

1313
01:23:22,414 --> 01:23:23,882
(laughing)

1314
01:23:27,886 --> 01:23:30,889
You did not expect
to love him.

1315
01:23:30,889 --> 01:23:32,390
Did you?

1316
01:23:36,895 --> 01:23:39,898
(gasping)

1317
01:23:39,898 --> 01:23:41,399
Get Matthew, Sarah.

1318
01:23:44,402 --> 01:23:45,403
Matthew.

1319
01:23:45,403 --> 01:23:46,905
(Maggie groaning)

1320
01:23:51,409 --> 01:23:53,411
Jacob, I'm so afraid.

1321
01:23:55,914 --> 01:23:57,415
I know.

1322
01:23:57,415 --> 01:24:00,418
Maggie:
Sarah!

1323
01:24:22,941 --> 01:24:24,442
Sarah:
Jacob?!

1324
01:24:24,442 --> 01:24:25,443
Jacob!

1325
01:24:25,443 --> 01:24:27,445
She's not breathing.

1326
01:24:27,445 --> 01:24:28,446
I don't know what to do.

1327
01:24:28,446 --> 01:24:29,447
Matthew!
Matthew!

1328
01:24:29,948 --> 01:24:30,448
She's not breathing.

1329
01:24:30,949 --> 01:24:31,950
Matthew, quick.

1330
01:24:31,950 --> 01:24:33,451
I don't know what to do.

1331
01:24:46,464 --> 01:24:48,967
(baby crying)

1332
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:32,944
(grunting)

1333
01:25:39,450 --> 01:25:41,953
(groaning)

1334
01:25:41,953 --> 01:25:44,455
(sobbing)

1335
01:26:02,807 --> 01:26:08,813
She was too young,
17 when Anna was born.

1336
01:26:08,813 --> 01:26:11,816
It took two days.

1337
01:26:13,318 --> 01:26:16,321
Terrible...

1338
01:26:16,321 --> 01:26:18,823
Terrible pain.

1339
01:26:20,325 --> 01:26:21,826
The doctor said it was

1340
01:26:22,327 --> 01:26:25,330
because she was
so young... small.

1341
01:26:27,832 --> 01:26:31,336
Said maybe we
shouldn't have any more.

1342
01:26:32,837 --> 01:26:35,840
I thought three years...

1343
01:26:36,341 --> 01:26:38,343
I needed... a boy.

1344
01:26:38,843 --> 01:26:41,846
Then she...

1345
01:26:44,349 --> 01:26:48,353
...wasn't there,
wasn't curled beside me in bed

1346
01:26:48,353 --> 01:26:50,855
and I couldn't stop
long enough to...

1347
01:26:53,358 --> 01:26:57,862
I had a newborn, Sarah,
a three-year-old...

1348
01:26:57,862 --> 01:27:03,868
farm, crops, animals,
the house, but she just...

1349
01:27:05,370 --> 01:27:06,871
...wasn't there.

1350
01:27:09,874 --> 01:27:17,382
I... I couldn't stop long enough
to... tell her good-bye...

1351
01:27:17,382 --> 01:27:22,887
that I was sorry...
and that itwasmy fault.

1352
01:27:31,396 --> 01:27:39,904
That I missed her...
more than life itself.

1353
01:27:41,406 --> 01:27:42,407
That you loved her.

1354
01:29:17,835 --> 01:29:19,837
(door closing)

1355
01:29:44,862 --> 01:29:46,864
(footsteps)

1356
01:30:23,901 --> 01:30:26,904
Remember,
a strong hand.

1357
01:30:27,905 --> 01:30:29,407
Yes, Jacob.

1358
01:30:29,407 --> 01:30:31,409
Best to be home
before dark.

1359
01:30:31,409 --> 01:30:33,911
Driving is hard if
there's no full moon.

1360
01:30:33,911 --> 01:30:35,413
Yes, Jacob.

1361
01:30:35,413 --> 01:30:36,414
Why can't we come?

1362
01:30:36,914 --> 01:30:37,915
Why do you have
to go alone?

1363
01:30:37,915 --> 01:30:39,917
Because I do.

1364
01:30:39,917 --> 01:30:42,920
Take care of Seal.

1365
01:31:03,941 --> 01:31:06,944
I am loud
and pesky.

1366
01:31:06,944 --> 01:31:08,446
You said so.

1367
01:31:08,446 --> 01:31:09,947
No, Caleb.

1368
01:31:09,947 --> 01:31:11,449
She would tell us.

1369
01:31:11,449 --> 01:31:13,951
The house
is too small.

1370
01:31:13,951 --> 01:31:16,454
The house is not too small.

1371
01:31:16,454 --> 01:31:17,955
She's leaving.

1372
01:31:17,955 --> 01:31:19,457
She's not.

1373
01:31:19,457 --> 01:31:22,460
Not without
her trunk and Seal

1374
01:31:22,460 --> 01:31:24,462
and saying good-bye.

1375
01:31:24,462 --> 01:31:25,963
Not yet.

1376
01:31:28,966 --> 01:31:31,469
What has Sarah
gone to do?

1377
01:31:31,469 --> 01:31:33,471
I don't know, Anna.

1378
01:31:33,471 --> 01:31:35,473
Sarah's Sarah.

1379
01:31:35,473 --> 01:31:37,975
She does things
her way, you know?

1380
01:31:37,975 --> 01:31:39,477
I know.

1381
01:31:44,982 --> 01:31:47,985
Ask him if
she's coming back.

1382
01:31:47,985 --> 01:31:50,488
Of course
she's coming back.

1383
01:31:51,489 --> 01:31:53,491
Caleb.

1384
01:31:53,491 --> 01:31:55,493
(meowing)

1385
01:32:16,480 --> 01:32:18,983
Papa, it's gone!

1386
01:32:18,983 --> 01:32:20,484
What's gone?

1387
01:32:20,484 --> 01:32:22,987
Sarah had a train
ticket home in
her bed stand.

1388
01:32:22,987 --> 01:32:24,488
It's gone!

1389
01:32:24,488 --> 01:32:27,491
You'll say it's not
my place to know it

1390
01:32:27,491 --> 01:32:29,493
but it's true, Papa,
and it's gone.

1391
01:32:29,493 --> 01:32:31,495
Go after her

1392
01:32:31,495 --> 01:32:32,997
Papa.

1393
01:33:55,613 --> 01:33:58,616
Jacob, I...
I turned in my ticket.

1394
01:33:58,616 --> 01:34:01,619
I have this money.

1395
01:34:47,164 --> 01:34:52,670
(playing a sad tune)

1396
01:35:34,545 --> 01:35:36,046
(barks)

1397
01:35:36,046 --> 01:35:38,048
Hush, Nick.

1398
01:35:45,556 --> 01:35:48,058
Seal was worried.

1399
01:35:49,059 --> 01:35:52,563
And the house is
too small, we thought.

1400
01:35:52,563 --> 01:35:54,565
And I am loud
and pesky.

1401
01:35:54,565 --> 01:35:56,066
We thought
you might

1402
01:35:56,066 --> 01:35:59,570
be leaving us
because you missed the sea.

1403
01:35:59,570 --> 01:36:03,073
Well, I'll always
miss my old home

1404
01:36:03,073 --> 01:36:07,077
but the truth of it is
I'd miss you more.

1405
01:36:14,585 --> 01:36:16,086
For you, Anna.

1406
01:36:16,086 --> 01:36:17,588
And for Caleb.

1407
01:36:17,588 --> 01:36:19,089
For all of us.

1408
01:36:19,089 --> 01:36:22,092
Blue and gray
and green.

1409
01:36:22,092 --> 01:36:24,094
Papa, look!

1410
01:36:24,094 --> 01:36:26,597
Sarah has brought

1411
01:36:26,597 --> 01:36:28,098
the sea.

1412
01:36:44,114 --> 01:36:48,118
(Sarah laughing)

1413
