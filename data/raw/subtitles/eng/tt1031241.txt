1
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:45,160
I thought it came
at quarter past.

2
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,290
They said quarter past.

3
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:50,630
Well, they were wrong.

4
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:53,710
Are you Mr. Boggis?

5
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:54,680
Ah.

6
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,570
You're master Tolly.

7
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:03,350
I remember you as smaller.

8
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:07,320
I was smaller. I've grown.

9
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:10,150
Yes, yeah, I suppose
you would have.

10
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:16,060
Mrs. Oldknow
would have met you,

11
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:20,070
but the  r.a.f. decided
to move out.

12
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:23,230
They only told her
this morning.

13
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:29,610
Your grandmother's looking
forward to seeing you.

14
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:31,040
Is she?

15
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:38,090
Aren't you gonna wear
your coat?

16
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:39,710
All right.

17
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,230
We've heard about Mr. David.

18
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:51,700
He's not dead.

19
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:54,600
Nobody says he's dead,
not even the telegram.

20
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:57,300
He's just missing inaction.

21
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:58,400
That's all.

22
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,240
Ah. Missing.

23
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:03,070
That's it. That's it.

24
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,670
How's your mother?

25
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:36,580
All right, but busy.

26
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:39,380
She's trying to find out
where he is.

27
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:42,510
She's had to go to London.

28
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:45,520
Yeah, I expect she has.

29
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,360
I expect we'll have some news
any day now.

30
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:57,170
I mean,
when you're taken prisoner,

31
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,630
someone's got
to know something.

32
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:01,760
Mm.

33
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,810
Yes, I think they have.

34
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,470
Um, would you double-check...

35
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,410
uh, has someone checked
the music room?

36
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,450
Hello, Tolly.

37
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,850
Hello.

38
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,150
Do I still call you "granny"?

39
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:58,620
Well, what else
did you have in mind?

40
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:02,290
I don't know. "Mrs. Oldknow"?

41
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:05,300
No,  I think we'd better stick
with "granny."

42
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:06,770
I'm sorry I couldn't meet you.

43
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:09,670
I just didn't dare
leave them to it.

44
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:10,830
Are you sad they're going?

45
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:12,200
No.

46
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:15,780
We Oldknows like to be
left to our own devices.

47
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,340
I think that's just about it.

48
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:20,180
I've told them to put everything
back and under dust sheets,

49
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,370
so I expect it's all wrong.

50
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:23,950
Ah. We'll sort it out.

51
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,620
I hope we haven't been
too awful.

52
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:28,320
Well, you didn't pull
the place down,

53
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:30,380
so you did better than some.

54
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:31,760
Well, I'm not sure the house
would have let us.

55
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:34,890
Goodbye.

56
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,360
Does this mean all the soldiers
will be home soon?

57
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:40,870
Well, there's an awful lot
of cleaning up to do.

58
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:43,340
But most of them should be here
before too long.

59
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:44,770
Everything ready to go, sir.

60
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,600
Right-o. Thank you.

61
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,660
Bye, again.

62
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,340
You remember Mrs. Tweedie?

63
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:53,470
How do you do?

64
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:56,210
Oh, course he don't.
Why should he?

65
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,620
He weren't much more than
a scrap when he was last here.

66
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:01,210
And this is Bismarck.

67
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:03,290
He remembers you.

68
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:05,950
Now you come along with me,
and we'll get you settled in.

69
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,430
Here we are.

70
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,400
Lovely.

71
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,240
How long have you worked here?

72
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,810
Oh, too man-years
to think about.

73
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:36,320
Do you like it?

74
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:40,430
Yes, I do.

75
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:44,860
Though, it's a funny old house,
no doubt about that.

76
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:47,530
But it's our funny old house.

77
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,740
That's what my dad used to say.

78
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,830
He used to talk about
this place all the time.

79
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,770
You come down
when you're ready.

80
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,360
You don't have to worry.

81
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,630
I know he's alive.

82
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:17,430
I think I'll still worry a bit,
if it's all right with you.

83
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:21,370
Won't you sit-down?

84
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:28,740
Who are all these people?

85
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:30,870
They're your family.

86
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,510
But they're dead, aren't they?

87
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,850
I thought family meant
people who were living.

88
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:39,380
I dare say the distinction is
more important in Manchester.

89
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:40,580
Than further South.

90
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,060
Have you ever been
to Manchester?

91
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,530
Not that I recall.

92
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:48,430
So, how do you know
so much about it?

93
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,990
Is your mother well?

94
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:56,000
Has she found a place
in London to stay?

95
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:59,060
I know you don't like her.
You don't have to pretend.

96
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:02,540
I didn't think I was pretending.

97
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:06,910
Here we are.

98
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:11,420
There's bread for toast.

99
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,910
Toasting fork's there.

100
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:19,690
Well, give me a shout
if you need anything else.

101
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:20,930
Thank you, Mrs. Tweedie.

102
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:28,490
It's not true I don't like her.

103
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:30,500
I don't know her.

104
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:32,540
You didn't want him
to marry her.

105
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:34,700
No.

106
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:35,840
Why was that?

107
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,070
Was it because she was common?

108
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:40,580
Certainly not.

109
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:42,050
You wrote that she was common.

110
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:45,450
And not fit to sweep the leaves
up on the drive.

111
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,650
I saw the letter.

112
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,020
Well, sometimes
when you're angry,

113
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:52,060
you can overstate your case.

114
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:55,690
He shouldn't have shown that
to you.

115
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,730
He didn't. I found it.

116
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,000
Then he shouldn't have kept it.

117
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,900
He kept all your letters.

118
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:12,170
I was worried she wouldn't
understand Green Knowe.

119
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:15,470
She'd come from something
very different.

120
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:17,750
Anyway, it's immaterial now.

121
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:18,980
Why?

122
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:22,160
I don't think I shall be here
for much longer.

123
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,160
Why? What's happened?

124
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,160
Nothing.

125
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,790
The world's changing.
That's all.

126
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,730
I don't think I'll have
enough money to stay.

127
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,820
You can't sell it.

128
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,460
I may have to.

129
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:37,970
But it's never been sold.

130
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:42,500
Uuh, it's never been sold
till now.

131
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,010
We've come close a few times.

132
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,010
She brought us
right to the brink.

133
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,180
Mrs. Thomas Oldknow...
like you?

134
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:54,950
Hardly.

135
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:56,190
That's Maria van raymer.

136
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:59,490
She was Dutch,
grew up in India.

137
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,860
She married Captain Oldknow
in Calcutta,

138
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:04,130
then he brought her home.

139
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,200
Green Knowe must have
seemed very dull.

140
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,730
After such exotic beginnings.

141
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,070
Would you do your own sugar?

142
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,730
What's this bit?
It looks different.

143
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:14,810
That was Maria's new wing.

144
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:17,740
It was built
so she could entertain.

145
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:22,940
Is it because dad's missing...
why you're going to leave?

146
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:27,650
No, it isn't.
You mustn't think that.

147
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,520
If there was anyway
I could avoid it,

148
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:30,680
I promise you, I would.

149
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,630
He always said this house
was a part of you.

150
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,960
It's a part of all of us.

151
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:40,260
It's a part of your father,
part of you, too.

152
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:46,670
You don't know the place yet,
and you don't know me.

153
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:49,710
So, I suppose it's hard
for you to understand.

154
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:51,870
If you think that, then you
don't know me, either.

155
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:57,250
You're burning your toast.

156
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,720
Aw.

157
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,650
Hello?

158
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,810
They look like jewellery boxes.

159
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:33,210
So they were...
for Maria Oldknow's jewels.

160
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:35,680
They must have been put
up there before the fire.

161
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,820
What fire?

162
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:39,350
When the new wing burned down.

163
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:42,090
Granny says she almost lost
Green Knowe,

164
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:44,060
but why, if she was so rich?

165
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,250
She didn't have money.

166
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:47,260
Her father
was a diamond merchant,

167
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:49,350
and her fortune was all
in precious stones.

168
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:51,630
She could have sold them.
She could have,

169
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,220
but by the time she needed to,
they'd been stolen.

170
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,970
Do you think she cried
when she lost the jewels?

171
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:02,980
Why?

172
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,710
Do you?

173
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:08,270
I'm sure she did. Wouldn't you?

174
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:10,820
I'm afraid she took it out
on the captain.

175
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:12,720
For quite awhile afterwards.

176
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:14,190
Did they have children?

177
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,950
They did.

178
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:19,990
They had a son called Sefton...

179
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:24,760
ah... and a daughter
called Susan.

180
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:27,200
And you descend from Sefton.

181
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:29,400
What a funny name.

182
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:32,200
I don't think
someone called to towsland.

183
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,710
Is in much of a position
to talk.

184
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,840
Was Sefton nice?

185
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:45,750
No. He was selfish and spoiled.

186
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:46,980
The door in the dining room.

187
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:48,720
With the brick wall
behind it...

188
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:50,890
was that the way
through to Maria's wing?

189
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:52,160
It was.

190
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,460
Oh, look.

191
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:55,960
You might like this.
It was your father's.

192
00:13:56,030 --> 00:14:00,440
I made the pyjamas when
David had whooping cough.

193
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,800
So they could both
have whooping cough together.

194
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:07,780
I'm too old for it, really.

195
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:08,870
Yes, I know.

196
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:12,050
I just thought
it might interest you.

197
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:15,210
To know it was his.

198
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:18,150
Was Susan spoiled and selfish
like her brother?

199
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:20,880
No, not at all.

200
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,120
No, it would be hard
to spoil her.

201
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:24,780
Why?

202
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:27,730
Enough.

203
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,160
Good night.

204
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,070
He's a real Manchester lad.

205
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:40,170
I offered to send him
to a proper school.

206
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,330
I was happy to pay
for his whole education,

207
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:44,340
but of course she wouldn't hear of it.

208
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:45,950
Why not?

209
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:48,350
She didn't want him taught
to look down on her.

210
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:49,320
So selfish.

211
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:52,010
You'd think
she'd put him first.

212
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:54,950
Obviously his father
agreed with her.

213
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,150
Only because he was hypnotized.

214
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,090
Well, I don't think
it's done him any harm.

215
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,960
He seems as bright
as a button to me.

216
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:03,260
She's a controller. That's all.

217
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:08,490
I'm not attacking her.
I'm just stating a fact.

218
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:11,230
That's why she's kept him away.

219
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:12,400
He's only here now.

220
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:14,980
Because she couldn't think
how else to manage things.

221
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:18,140
It was exactly the same with
David, right from the start...

222
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:19,770
she could never share him.

223
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:21,840
Could you?

224
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:01,150
Sefton, is that you?

225
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:03,820
What where you thinking of,
wandering off like that?

226
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:05,860
Supposing you'd have
fallen down the stairs.

227
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:06,950
And broken your neck?

228
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,550
What would you say then?

229
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:11,220
Very little, I should think.

230
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,130
Never mind your cheek.

231
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,500
Come back to your own room now.

232
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:17,900
But, Perkins,
I was only talking to...

233
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:21,270
is it Sefton?

234
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:25,010
There's nobody here,
Miss Susan.

235
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:42,400
What are you doing downstairs?

236
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:46,600
Well, I hope
it's something serious.

237
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,030
Are you ill?

238
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,540
No.

239
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,570
Well, what is it?

240
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,210
Do you... do you believe in...

241
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:57,510
well, yes?

242
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:01,220
In ghosts...
do you believe in ghosts?

243
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:04,490
Certainly, I do. Don't you?

244
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,080
I do now.

245
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,620
Oh.

246
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:11,180
Oh, I see, yes.
Which of them was it?

247
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:14,490
Susan.

248
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:20,470
Well, yes, it would be,
after all those questions.

249
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:23,370
You'd better go to bed.
You'll get cold.

250
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,370
Do you want some more hot milk?

251
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,630
Hmm?

252
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:30,930
Mr. Boggis.

253
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,910
Mrs. Tweedie
told me about the fire.

254
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:37,250
How far did the
missing wing stretch?

255
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,220
Beyond the cedar tree there.

256
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:40,410
They planted that.

257
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:43,180
When they tore what was left
of it down.

258
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,120
One big room for dining,

259
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:48,060
drawing room,
family bedrooms above.

260
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,540
But it seems big enough
as it is.

261
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:01,060
Eh.

262
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,970
I think I'll climb the oak tree.

263
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,270
Don't do yourself a mischief.

264
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:53,990
Susan? Susan, is that you?

265
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:58,730
It's Sefton's spur.

266
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:02,290
We'll clean it up
and put it with its pair.

267
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:04,630
Is there a picture of Sefton?

268
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,170
Yes, it's there.

269
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:11,580
Boggis has brought the tree
into the music room.

270
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:14,350
Still a bit of a mess in there,
I'm afraid.

271
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:16,340
I thought we could
tidy it up later.

272
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,540
Then we could
decorate the tree.

273
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:21,750
You don't have to.

274
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:24,350
It's all right. I'll do it.

275
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:29,690
Why would Sefton
hide his own spur?

276
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,270
Oh, he didn't.
He wasn't the "s."

277
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:36,560
and the "j"was for someone
who changed Susan's life.

278
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,400
Unfortunately, not everyone.

279
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:41,100
Was pleased to see him
at Green Knowe.

280
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:45,540
There was a Butler here then
called John Caxton.

281
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:47,270
He might have been kinder.

282
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:55,520
Welcome home, captain.

283
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,620
Thank you, Caxton.
Thank you, one and all.

284
00:19:57,690 --> 00:19:59,060
Father! oh!

285
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:01,460
My darling!

286
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:04,660
What's this?

287
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:05,720
Oh.

288
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,630
She was running
all over the house, sir.

289
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,500
She would have done herself
an injury.

290
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:12,660
So she was tethered like a dog.

291
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,370
Did you know about it?

292
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,170
What else were we do to?

293
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,680
Would you rather
she fell down the stairs?

294
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,110
She's blind, Thomas.

295
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:22,150
She simply must get used to it.

296
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:24,450
But I am used to it, papa.

297
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:27,280
I'm so very, very used to it.

298
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,190
How are you, Maria?

299
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:36,160
How should I be,
after seven months in prison.

300
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:39,290
And no one but a blind girl
for company?

301
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:41,560
You've not been ill, I hope?

302
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,800
No, since you don't count
fatigue or melancholy.

303
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:46,100
As illness.

304
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:47,440
Where's Sefton?

305
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,710
Hello, father.

306
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:52,610
Were you not here to keep
your mother and sister company?

307
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,670
Some of the time.

308
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,720
Don't fuss the boy.
Now, let's go in.

309
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:58,310
Oh, are you not curious to see
what I've brought?

310
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:02,650
My dear.

311
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:09,520
Oh. Spurs.

312
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,470
I thought you wanted some.

313
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:12,520
You're too late.

314
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,430
Lord Farrar gave him
a pair last month.

315
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,470
Finer than these, I'm afraid.

316
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:20,240
Were they, indeed,
finer than these?

317
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:21,670
Well, he's the boy's godfather.

318
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,440
I suppose he can
give him a present.

319
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:25,670
I suppose he can.

320
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,180
Why was Farrar here?

321
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,580
He was staying nearby.

322
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:31,240
And looked in with some friends
for an evening.

323
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:35,350
Did you play?

324
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,620
I could hardly refuse
in my own house.

325
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:39,780
It would have looked
extraordinary.

326
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:42,560
How much did you lose, Maria?

327
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:43,820
A little.

328
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:44,900
A little.

329
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,590
A little or a lot.

330
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:48,500
What difference does it make?

331
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,230
You'll be angry either way.

332
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:53,430
What about me, father?
Is there nothing for me?

333
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:56,570
Ah, well, now,
one would have thought.

334
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,380
Let me see.

335
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:03,280
Ah, no, there seems to be
nothing here, unless...

336
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,920
tell me, please.

337
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:09,320
Help me.

338
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:10,620
Oh, mother, do say.

339
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:16,260
It's me.

340
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:19,930
This... is Jacob.

341
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:22,600
He'll be your special helper.

342
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:26,670
Now take him 'round the grounds
and show him his new home.

343
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:27,700
But first...

344
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,670
burn it.

345
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:37,480
Captain! Is that wise?

346
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:38,850
Come, Jacob.

347
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,480
Walk with me,

348
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:42,420
and you can describe
what you see.

349
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,700
This is a fine place.

350
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,750
Is it?

351
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:50,460
Sure. I never saw a...

352
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:52,700
My dad used to talk about
decorating the tree in here.

353
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,930
Look.

354
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,440
This was his favourite.

355
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,970
You hang it,
to remember him by.

356
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,870
I don't need to remember him.

357
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:13,020
Yes, your father
loved this one...

358
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:15,020
when he was a boy.

359
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:19,480
You could give parties
in a room like this.

360
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,390
Well, that's what
it was built for.

361
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:23,860
We'll have one
when he gets back.

362
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,560
Mm.

363
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:27,830
We had wonderful dances
when I was a girl.

364
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:37,610
Oh, blow me down!
What on earth is all this?

365
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:40,370
It's a Bible.

366
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:42,380
Oh.

367
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:45,280
It's the captain's Bible.

368
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:46,280
How odd.

369
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:47,980
I wondered where it had got to.

370
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,890
I hadn't seen it for years.

371
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:53,990
He's made it look as
if Jacob was his son.

372
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:56,960
So he has.

373
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:58,590
Like this..."ah!"

374
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:06,310
aren't you coming in?

375
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:08,000
Of course.

376
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:14,540
Where did you find him?

377
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:18,520
Well, I suppose the truth of it
is that he found me.

378
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:22,310
He appeared on board
the day we sailed.

379
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:23,380
He's runaway.

380
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,320
A runaway? A runaway what?

381
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:27,790
What do you think?
A runaway slave, of course.

382
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:30,560
He was going to be sold
in the market at Charleston,

383
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:33,570
but somehow he gave them the
slip and made for the harbour.

384
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:35,330
And sneaked on to your ship.

385
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,340
He heard we were bound
for England,

386
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,740
so he swam out that night
and climbed aboard.

387
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:44,370
I hid him in a barrel for
the harbour master's inspection,

388
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:46,540
and here he is.

389
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,910
But doesn't that mean
he's somebody's property?

390
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:52,040
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

391
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:55,520
Isn't it forbidden to keep
a stowaway aboard?

392
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:57,850
And if it is...

393
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:00,550
to help Jacob or any
slave to freedom,

394
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:02,890
I'd break every rule
in the book.

395
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,990
Oh, he's as bright
as a button, Maria.

396
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:06,690
I never knew a boy so quick.

397
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:08,530
Don't let Sefton hear you.

398
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,540
Hmm.

399
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,440
So, what will you do
with him now?

400
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:16,740
Well, as I said, he'll be
a friend for Susan.

401
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:19,440
I thought you were joking.

402
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:21,000
He'll change her life.
I promise you.

403
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,450
He can read to her.
He can learn with her.

404
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,450
He'll be her eyes.

405
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,040
That's as maybe.

406
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,560
Go on.

407
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:32,490
Well, apart from anything else,

408
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:35,720
he's... not English.

409
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:40,130
Do you think such distinctions
mean anything to her?

410
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:41,570
Come, come, my love.

411
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,400
You know better than anyone.

412
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:46,030
What it is like to be a stranger
in a foreign land.

413
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:47,730
Be kind to him.

414
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:48,870
But he's a boy.

415
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,480
I had noticed.

416
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,610
Then there's Perkins.

417
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:52,600
Dismiss her.

418
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,440
Susan's too old
to have a nurse, anyway.

419
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,480
But a boy can't wait on a girl.

420
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,110
Who's to bathe her or dress her?
And where will he live?

421
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:01,920
Find him a room in the stables
and hire a maid if you must.

422
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:04,860
From now on,
Jacob is Susan's companion.

423
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:09,760
You talk as if your former slave
isn't even to be a servant.

424
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:14,900
What will people say?

425
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:16,940
Nothing that will interest me.

426
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:26,510
We'll be a laughing stock.

427
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:29,050
I don't expect he'll stay long,
Mr. Sefton.

428
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,180
I don't, really.

429
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:33,480
I don't think he'll find
he fits in.

430
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:38,060
But he did fit in.

431
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:41,120
Of course. Susan was blind.

432
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,460
I should have realized.

433
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:45,070
What do you mean?

434
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:47,690
How did Jacob cope
with Susan's blindness?

435
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:50,070
Oh, he wouldn't have
thought about it.

436
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:51,940
Oh!

437
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:57,510
The point is, he set her free.

438
00:26:57,580 --> 00:27:00,880
He gave her wings.

439
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:04,080
It's much too big for just us.

440
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:06,520
But we don't care, do we?

441
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:07,690
We do not.

442
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,690
Who's he?

443
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,200
St. Christopher, of course.

444
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,260
Why is he here?

445
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:22,800
Nobody knows.
He's always stood here.

446
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:25,000
Did the old part burn?

447
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:27,110
A bit. Not too much.

448
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:29,700
Why not?

449
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:32,710
Because Fred Boggis
got a bucket line going.

450
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:34,870
There was a Boggis here then?

451
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:38,510
There's always been a Boggis
at Green Knowe.

452
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:45,130
After the fire, the captain
built a big music room.

453
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:47,180
To replace the rooms
that were lost.

454
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:50,630
Ah.

455
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,760
She never cared for it.

456
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,670
I don't think their marriage
was all that easy.

457
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:03,270
Not many of them are,
Master Tolly, not too many.

458
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:05,870
Are you married, Mr. Boggis?

459
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:12,950
I am.

460
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:15,760
Things are really quite
peaceful at the moment,

461
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,090
as it happens.

462
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:22,300
Yep. Really quite peaceful.

463
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:26,030
Oh. Just making a cup of coffee
for your grandmother.

464
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:28,830
Would you like one?

465
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,770
Mrs. Tweedie?

466
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:31,740
Hmm?

467
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:33,310
Have you ever seen any of them?

468
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:34,640
Any what?

469
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,040
Any of the people
who lived here before.

470
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:41,600
The Oldknows.

471
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:44,170
Mrs. Oldknow lives here now,
don't she?

472
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:46,880
Or have I got that wrong?

473
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:50,910
I mean Susan,
for instance, or Caxton.

474
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:54,060
Don't go stuffing your head.

475
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:55,960
With all that
superstitious nonsense.

476
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:59,930
"let the dead bury the dead"...
that's what the Bible says.

477
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:01,940
I've never understood that.

478
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:04,670
How can the dead bury the dead?

479
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:05,800
I don't know.

480
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:09,070
But I do know
if I don't get a move on,

481
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:11,350
this coffee's gonna be cold.

482
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:12,740
Door, please.

483
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,630
Who is it? Who's there?

484
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:33,100
What are you talking about?

485
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,900
It's me, Tolly.

486
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:36,330
You came before, didn't you?

487
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,200
What's going on?
Who are you speaking to?

488
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:39,710
Last year.

489
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:41,370
In the nursery, when Perkins
came and took me away.

490
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,380
Last year?
Two nights ago, you mean.

491
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,980
Jacob! Jacob!

492
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:47,000
Quickly... where can he hide?

493
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,070
Bring him round here.

494
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:49,210
Get him in the cupboard.

495
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,720
Get in the cupboard!

496
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:55,050
Where is the little beggar?

497
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,950
Who?

498
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,850
Don't you dare take his side.

499
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:01,390
Do you think I don't see you
together, grinning and laughing?

500
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:03,000
You shouldn't be so funny.

501
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,870
Mr. Sefton.

502
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:06,270
Getaway from there.

503
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:08,100
Leave her alone.

504
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:12,130
Now, you come along with me,
little Jacob.

505
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:14,760
I've got a job for you.

506
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,670
The captain says
I'm to stay with Susan.

507
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:18,210
"Miss Susan,"
you impertinent blackguard.

508
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,300
Miss Susan.

509
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:21,240
I was told to follow
Miss Susan's orders.

510
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:22,800
I'm giving the orders now.

511
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,020
Pardon, sir,
but the captain did say.

512
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:25,250
He was only to take orders
from Miss Susan!

513
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,020
Keep out of this, Boggis,
or you'll be sorry.

514
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,110
But I heard him!

515
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:29,750
Silence! How dare you parade
your insolence here?

516
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:30,760
Leave him be!

517
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:32,950
You wouldn't do this
if papa was at home!

518
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:34,390
Well, he isn't, is he?!

519
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:35,690
No! Get off!

520
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,850
Let him go!

521
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:39,030
Can I help? Tell me!

522
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:40,030
Let go of me!

523
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:42,900
Don't take on, Miss Susan.

524
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:45,040
- He won't hurt him. He wouldn't dare.
- But who...

525
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,770
Come on.
Let's see what's happening.

526
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:23,270
No! Get off!

527
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,780
Uh!

528
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:27,350
Sefton, leave him alone!

529
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:30,410
Back, you cat!
Control yourself.

530
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,210
I've got a job for him.
That's all.

531
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:34,820
I shot a pheasant today
that fell into the chimney,

532
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:35,820
and I want it.

533
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:37,490
Don't. Jacob, don't do it.

534
00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:40,220
Can't you stop this,
Mr. Caxton?

535
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:42,060
None of this would happen
if the master was home.

536
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:43,500
Hold your tongue, girl.

537
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:46,830
When the captain's away,
Mr. Sefton's master here.

538
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:47,930
Get on, you little tyke.

539
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,030
I want my bird,
and I'm tired of waiting.

540
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,970
Don't. Don't.

541
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:56,940
It's all right. I can do it.

542
00:31:57,010 --> 00:32:00,240
See? You're the one
making all the fuss.

543
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:03,310
Now take her upstairs
before I really lose my temper!

544
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,440
Come with me.

545
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,920
You can wait in your room.

546
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:08,390
He'll be all right.

547
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:11,950
Faster!

548
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:18,260
Robert... light the fire.

549
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:21,540
That'll speed things up a bit.

550
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:23,300
You don't have to do this,
you know.

551
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:24,540
He can't force you, Robert.

552
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:26,340
- What kind of man are you?
- Oh, well...

553
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:28,370
Robert, no.

554
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:31,210
Come on.
Don't make a meal of it.

555
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:41,980
My God.

556
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,830
For two pins I'd...

557
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:48,550
you'd what?

558
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:50,530
You'd lose your place.
That's what.

559
00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:58,000
Just pray for him.
That's all we can do now.

560
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:16,980
If it isn't lord farrar's
precious spurs.

561
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:20,580
Should someone go up after him?

562
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:22,950
And exactly who would
you suggest, sir?

563
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:25,050
I maybe in for a spot of bother.

564
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:26,490
If anything happens to him.

565
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:31,390
Boggis, clear this out.
Dampen it down.

566
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:34,190
It was only a bit of fun, man.

567
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:35,500
Where's your sense of humour?

568
00:34:57,290 --> 00:34:59,620
Finer than the captain's,
are they?

569
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:29,060
What? Who is it?

570
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:30,680
Shh. It's me.

571
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,690
Jacob.

572
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,520
Are you all right?
Are you hurt?

573
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:35,060
I'm all right.

574
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:37,720
Will you help me
play a trick on Mr. Sefton?

575
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,730
Oh, for heaven's sake, Susan,
I'm too busy for this.

576
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:42,600
Sefton, what's going on?

577
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:47,040
I told you...
he sent Jacob up the chimney.

578
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:48,300
Is this true?

579
00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:50,080
Why does it matter?

580
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,040
Is it true?

581
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:52,600
And if it is?

582
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,740
My darling,
you've been foolish.

583
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:58,150
What will you tell your father
if the boy comes to any harm?

584
00:35:58,220 --> 00:35:59,740
Mr. Sefton was shooting,

585
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:02,360
and a bird fell
into the chimney.

586
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,490
Wouldn't it have been more
foolish to have left it there?

587
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:05,720
Thank you, Caxton.

588
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:09,090
When I want your advice,
I shall ask for it.

589
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,720
What's that?

590
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:15,730
Mr. Sefton, sir, I got your bird.

591
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,730
Oh, my dear.

592
00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:27,380
Are the gentlemen shooting
chickens these days?

593
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,450
That's enough, all of you!

594
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:34,320
Shouldn't someone take it to
cook with the rest of the bag?

595
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:36,220
Come on, Jacob.

596
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:43,130
I'm your mother, and
I love you very much,

597
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:45,100
but you must learn
to control your temper,

598
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:47,130
or you'll end up in worse
trouble than this.

599
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,590
That'll teach him.

600
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:52,600
I doubt it.

601
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:54,500
What we have to put up with.

602
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:56,440
Worse things happen at sea.

603
00:36:58,410 --> 00:37:00,500
Take it away, Caxton.

604
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:03,710
Very good, sir.

605
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:06,620
I want to be rid of him, Caxton.

606
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:09,350
I want him out of this house.

607
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:11,690
How dare he prance about.

608
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:15,520
Waving my father's favour
in my face?

609
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,760
How dare he?

610
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:22,790
Patience, Mr. Sefton, patience.

611
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:27,240
Oh, when, oh, when,

612
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:31,440
will we be free of these
frightful coupons?

613
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,380
Mum says rationing will get
worse before it gets better.

614
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:36,510
It will.
She's right, I'm afraid.

615
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:40,380
I mean, it seems so unfair
when the war's nearly over.

616
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:43,390
If only things could
get back to normal.

617
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:46,190
She doesn't think things
will ever be normal again.

618
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:47,280
Oh, yes.

619
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,730
Well, a different normal,
but normal.

620
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,160
You take my word for it.

621
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,270
I'm so glad you could
come and stay.

622
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:58,740
I should hate to think you had
no memories of the old place.

623
00:37:58,810 --> 00:37:59,740
Before it went.

624
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:00,870
Morning.

625
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:03,310
I've got some memories
now, all right.

626
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:05,610
Well, you mustn't be frightened.

627
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:08,270
The house is bound
to share some secrets.

628
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:11,320
But you mustn't be scared.

629
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:12,850
I don't think I'm scared.

630
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:15,350
I don't know
what I feel exactly.

631
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:16,850
Good.

632
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,650
Very few people realize
they don't know what they feel.

633
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:20,920
Until they're at least 40.

634
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:27,160
Tolly, Tolly, you
do understand...

635
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:29,500
death is not
the important thing.

636
00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:31,560
What is, then?

637
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:35,570
Whether you were loved or not.

638
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,880
That's what people think about
at the end of their lives.

639
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,610
Do you believe that?

640
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:42,710
Yes, I do.

641
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:46,220
You can't possibly be
warm in just that.

642
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,520
Granny? Hmm?

643
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:54,930
You've never seen him,
have you,

644
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:57,450
since he's been missing?

645
00:38:57,530 --> 00:38:58,460
Because I haven't.

646
00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:00,230
I mean, I'm sure he's all right.

647
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:01,670
Because if he wasn't, I think

648
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:03,600
I would have seen him
by now, don't you?

649
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:06,940
And if you had, you would
have told me, wouldn't you?

650
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:10,460
Yes. I would have told you.

651
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:13,480
And, no, I haven't seen him.

652
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:15,310
That's something, anyway.

653
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:17,250
Mm-hmm.

654
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:39,540
Well, here's the shopping,
what there is of it.

655
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:41,700
Thank you, Tolly.

656
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:43,670
Where's Boggis?

657
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:45,970
He was working on the brambles
in the tower garden.

658
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,570
Where's that?

659
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:51,450
Beyond the stone coronet,
then turn left.

660
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:54,780
Why won't he wear a proper coat?

661
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:55,820
'cause he's a boy.

662
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:02,720
Boggis is kind, but if
I eat another rabbit,

663
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,960
I swear I'll turn into one.

664
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:07,000
He will keep bringing them in,
no matter what I say.

665
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:07,900
Ooh.

666
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:18,710
You've got your work cut out.

667
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:22,020
I don't know how we let it
turn into this.

668
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:24,980
Why is it called
the tower garden?

669
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:27,420
Because of the tower.

670
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:29,020
What tower?

671
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:31,490
Over there.

672
00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:35,330
Yeah, well, I suppose
you can't see it now.

673
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:40,570
When did it get so growed over?

674
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,590
What was it used for?

675
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:48,640
Water tower, I think, first,

676
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,610
with a big bath underneath.

677
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,370
A bath?

678
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,410
You mean, like,
"having a bath"?

679
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,710
Yeah, I know.
Seems funny, don't it?

680
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,450
Can I see?

681
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,450
Too dark to see anything.

682
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:05,390
I've got a torch.

683
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:13,760
It's much bigger down here.

684
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:16,670
A bath was a big event
in those days.

685
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:20,870
They dug out all
these tunnels and rooms.

686
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:23,470
So they'd have parties under
the ground while they bathed.

687
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:24,870
Like the Romans.

688
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:28,000
Yeah.

689
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,680
Then they put plumbing
in the house.

690
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:30,800
And forgot about this place.

691
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:36,050
Turned it into a garden
ornament, a folly.

692
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:40,620
When was this? Before the fire?

693
00:41:40,690 --> 00:41:43,960
Oh, yeah. 20 years or more.

694
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:47,560
Mind you... it came in handy.

695
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,530
A few days before
the fire happened.

696
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:50,900
Why?

697
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:53,530
Never you mind.

698
00:41:57,610 --> 00:42:01,380
He swore it was the same
as our usual brand.

699
00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:03,380
It looks simply revolting.

700
00:42:03,450 --> 00:42:04,940
War means sacrifice.

701
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,990
I think Tolly's all right.

702
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:11,990
Yes.

703
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:15,300
It's a funny old house to
wake up and find yourself in.

704
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:16,390
Yes.

705
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,370
But it's our funny old house.

706
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:21,700
That's what he said.

707
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:26,010
Did he? Did he, really?

708
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:28,840
It's going to have to go.

709
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,480
I'm afraid so.

710
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:34,570
I do the sums.
They don't change.

711
00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:36,150
Ain't there nothing
you can sell?

712
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:38,080
Not really.

713
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:39,880
Nothing that would make
any difference.

714
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:41,580
You'd think there'd be
an old master.

715
00:42:41,650 --> 00:42:42,680
Tucked in here somewhere.

716
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,020
Oh, we had a Vermeer once.

717
00:42:44,090 --> 00:42:47,630
Heaven knows
we could use it now.

718
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:51,030
I just wish I didn't feel
I was cheating Tolly.

719
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:53,930
Oh, he's a sensible boy.

720
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,490
He'll get through it.

721
00:42:55,570 --> 00:42:59,040
Besides, he's got more
important things to worry about.

722
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:02,740
He never stops thinking
about his father, for a start.

723
00:43:02,810 --> 00:43:05,740
Well, none of us do.

724
00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:07,780
No.

725
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,700
What shall we do?

726
00:43:33,770 --> 00:43:36,140
We have to stop them
finding him.

727
00:43:36,210 --> 00:43:37,140
We have to.

728
00:43:40,010 --> 00:43:42,540
Who are you?

729
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:43,670
You can see me?

730
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:45,150
Of course I can see you.

731
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:46,810
Why shouldn't I see you?

732
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:48,080
Who is this boy?

733
00:43:48,150 --> 00:43:51,590
I think he might be a...
a relation of mine.

734
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:53,150
You are, aren't you, in a way?

735
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:54,690
In a way.

736
00:43:54,690 --> 00:43:55,850
But I know your family,

737
00:43:55,930 --> 00:43:58,230
and I can assure you
this ain't none of them.

738
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:00,820
Shall I start
with what he's wearing?

739
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:04,500
It's all right, Jacob.
Maybe he can help.

740
00:44:04,570 --> 00:44:05,840
What's happened?

741
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,840
Fred Boggis...
they caught him poaching.

742
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:08,970
Just some hares.

743
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,640
Now Sefton means
to sell him to the gang.

744
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,740
What gang? The press gang.

745
00:44:12,810 --> 00:44:14,640
They kidnap men
to crew the ships.

746
00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:15,740
Why?

747
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:16,840
How else they gonna get
enough sailors?

748
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,140
So he'll have to go
with the gang,

749
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:20,590
and Sefton and Caxton will split
what they can get for him.

750
00:44:20,590 --> 00:44:23,250
The stupid thing is,
my father would save him,

751
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:24,950
and he's due back any day.

752
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:27,050
Caxton knows he's
still here somewhere.

753
00:44:27,130 --> 00:44:28,560
He's watching us all the time.

754
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:29,820
Where's Fred hiding?

755
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:32,060
There's a maze of tunnels
under the old water tower.

756
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:33,220
I know it. I'll find him.

757
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:34,630
Go to the kitchen first.

758
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:36,270
He hasn't had anything
to eat for three days.

759
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:38,170
And you can find out
if you're visible or not.

760
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,260
Excuse me?

761
00:44:40,610 --> 00:44:42,070
Nothing from the captain yet,
Mrs. Robbins.

762
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:43,610
Most inconsiderate, I must say.

763
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:44,880
How can we plan our menus.

764
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,810
Without so much
as a "by your leave"?

765
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:51,280
Menus are not of much interest
to the admiralty, Mrs. Gross.

766
00:44:51,350 --> 00:44:52,620
Yes, girl?

767
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:54,180
I was just wondering.

768
00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:57,780
If there was any news
about Fred Boggis.

769
00:44:57,860 --> 00:44:59,050
Really, Rose?

770
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:02,030
Well, I was just wondering
if you had any work to do.

771
00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:05,050
Because if not,
why do we pay your wages?

772
00:45:05,130 --> 00:45:06,960
Yes, Mrs. Gross.

773
00:45:11,170 --> 00:45:14,610
Not that I wouldn't like
to give her a word of comfort.

774
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:17,070
Mr. Sefton's very hard
on young Boggis.

775
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:18,130
That I do think.

776
00:45:18,210 --> 00:45:20,700
Mr. Caxton's put him up to it.

777
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:24,610
Mr. Caxton gets above his self
when the captain's away.

778
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:27,650
He's cleverer than
the people he works for.

779
00:45:27,650 --> 00:45:30,920
If you ask me, that's always
a recipe for trouble.

780
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:32,060
And he certainly takes on.

781
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:33,860
A great many of the
captain's duties.

782
00:45:33,930 --> 00:45:35,860
Now, now.

783
00:45:35,930 --> 00:45:38,360
Aah!

784
00:45:38,630 --> 00:45:41,620
Rose, whatever is the matter
with you, girl?

785
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:44,940
I-I just...

786
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:46,930
nothing, ma'am.

787
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:49,100
I cut my finger.

788
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:50,940
Get on with your work.

789
00:45:51,010 --> 00:45:52,640
Yes, ma'am.

790
00:45:58,950 --> 00:46:01,250
I just need to get
some more milk, ma'am.

791
00:46:10,730 --> 00:46:13,100
Who are you?

792
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:18,030
Are you a... ghost?

793
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:21,200
I don't think I can be.

794
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:24,170
I mean, I'm not dead.

795
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,730
Come to think of it,
I'm not actually even born yet.

796
00:46:26,810 --> 00:46:27,980
What?

797
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:28,970
Never mind all that.

798
00:46:29,050 --> 00:46:30,950
I need something
for Fred Boggis to eat.

799
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:32,040
Fred?

800
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:33,710
Can you help? Of course.

801
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:36,190
Have you seen him?

802
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:37,860
Is he all right?

803
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:39,690
I don't know yet.

804
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,320
What about this pie?

805
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:50,400
Well, that will never work.

806
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,410
Put it inside your clothes.

807
00:46:52,410 --> 00:46:53,740
That might do it.

808
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:54,930
It's worth a try.

809
00:46:55,010 --> 00:46:58,140
Well, what if Caxton
and his men can see you?

810
00:46:58,140 --> 00:47:01,140
Some people can. I did.

811
00:47:01,210 --> 00:47:03,680
Let's just hope they can't, then.

812
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:07,910
If you do get to Fred,
tell him to look after himself.

813
00:47:10,490 --> 00:47:12,120
Tell him Rose said so.

814
00:47:12,190 --> 00:47:13,160
I will.

815
00:47:21,070 --> 00:47:22,730
Aah!

816
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:23,220
Fred?

817
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:25,350
Are you down here?

818
00:48:25,430 --> 00:48:28,490
Fred?

819
00:48:28,570 --> 00:48:31,040
Fred?

820
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:33,070
Fred?

821
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:34,200
Are you here?

822
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:41,250
Fred?

823
00:48:41,250 --> 00:48:43,550
Susan told me to come.

824
00:48:49,050 --> 00:48:50,990
Who are you?

825
00:48:50,990 --> 00:48:52,860
You can see me, then.

826
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:54,050
Of course I can.

827
00:48:54,130 --> 00:48:56,250
And I should think everyone
else can see you, too.

828
00:48:56,330 --> 00:48:57,850
No, no one did.

829
00:48:57,930 --> 00:49:00,460
What's that?

830
00:49:00,530 --> 00:49:03,500
It's just a torch.

831
00:49:03,570 --> 00:49:05,560
I've brought you some food.

832
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:11,140
Torch?

833
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:15,440
It's not even burning.

834
00:49:15,510 --> 00:49:17,850
How's it work?

835
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:20,150
Here.

836
00:49:20,150 --> 00:49:22,280
Thanks.

837
00:49:22,350 --> 00:49:25,290
The message is,
you've got to stay here.

838
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:28,590
But they'll find me.

839
00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:30,450
They've searched it
twice already.

840
00:49:30,530 --> 00:49:33,900
One of them came so close,
I could smell his breath.

841
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:35,300
Next time they're gonna
get me for sure.

842
00:49:35,370 --> 00:49:36,830
No, I have to make a run
for it...

843
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:40,070
no, the captain will be home
any day now, any moment.

844
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:41,910
I promise.

845
00:49:41,910 --> 00:49:44,270
And that's what
Miss Susan says?

846
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:46,370
It is.

847
00:49:48,550 --> 00:49:51,020
All right.

848
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:54,320
I'll stay, though I may regret it.

849
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:56,410
Keep hidden. And good luck.

850
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:02,190
You wouldn't lend me that,
would you?

851
00:50:02,190 --> 00:50:04,160
Gets so dark down here.

852
00:50:04,230 --> 00:50:06,990
Keep it.

853
00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:08,430
Don't use it too much.

854
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:10,260
The battery will run out,

855
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:12,260
and I don't expect
you'll be able to get another.

856
00:50:12,270 --> 00:50:13,530
What's battery?

857
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:16,870
It's a big question.

858
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:20,940
Oh, and Rose said
to look after yourself.

859
00:50:21,010 --> 00:50:23,280
Did she, now?

860
00:50:23,350 --> 00:50:24,320
Rose?

861
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:29,010
Fancy that.

862
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:46,900
At last we've solved the mystery.

863
00:50:46,970 --> 00:50:48,170
Of the miracle light.

864
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:51,400
It's been part of our mythology
for so long.

865
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:53,600
Has it?

866
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:55,380
I can't think why
I didn't guess.

867
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:58,910
It's obvious, once you know.

868
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:02,110
It was a present from my daddy.

869
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:06,360
Well, then you both helped Fred.

870
00:51:12,670 --> 00:51:14,960
Granny?

871
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:17,560
This morning I had the torch
in my pocket.

872
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:19,190
Yes.

873
00:51:19,270 --> 00:51:20,970
But it was already in the case.

874
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:23,630
Mm, I suppose that's right.

875
00:51:23,710 --> 00:51:26,180
But surely isn't that
impossible?

876
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:30,380
Well... obviously not.

877
00:51:30,450 --> 00:51:32,250
There's one thing
I don't understand.

878
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:33,550
Only one?

879
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:35,090
Lucky old you.

880
00:51:35,150 --> 00:51:37,250
Seriously... with ghosts,

881
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:40,430
why is it that some people
can see them and some can't,

882
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:43,260
but then others can only see
them sometimes?

883
00:51:43,330 --> 00:51:45,990
Well, I don't know.

884
00:51:46,070 --> 00:51:49,700
It might depend on being open.

885
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:52,030
Maybe we get so full
of our own affairs,

886
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:53,630
we block off everything else.

887
00:51:53,710 --> 00:51:56,370
But some people can always
see them, can't they?

888
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:59,240
Oh, yes.

889
00:51:59,310 --> 00:52:00,440
Now, look...

890
00:52:00,510 --> 00:52:03,000
I've got some very tedious
business to attend to.

891
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:04,720
Why don't you go off
for a walk?

892
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:06,510
I'll see you at lunch.

893
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:07,640
All right.

894
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:12,650
Bismarck, go with him.

895
00:52:14,190 --> 00:52:16,220
What a useless dog.

896
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:27,000
Granny, would it be all right
if I go down to the vill...

897
00:52:27,070 --> 00:52:30,300
Are you so lost
to proportion, sir,

898
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:31,430
that even supposing.

899
00:52:31,510 --> 00:52:34,340
You were entitled to feel
aggrieved with this man,

900
00:52:34,410 --> 00:52:37,750
which you were not,
it seemed reasonable to you.

901
00:52:37,750 --> 00:52:41,020
To condemn him
to 10 years of slavery?

902
00:52:50,230 --> 00:52:51,590
Well may you be silent.

903
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:57,300
You are weak and easily led.

904
00:52:57,370 --> 00:53:01,270
And those who are easily led
are not easily followed.

905
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:06,380
You are a disgrace to this family.

906
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:11,070
Now go to your room. Thomas...
to your room, sir!

907
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:16,590
I'm sad, Caxton.

908
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:17,660
After our years together,

909
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:19,490
I would have looked
for something better.

910
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:24,720
Your employment is terminated.

911
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:27,350
What?

912
00:53:27,430 --> 00:53:30,420
You may take a month's
wages in lieu of notice.

913
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:34,630
But, Thomas,
you can't mean that.

914
00:53:34,710 --> 00:53:36,470
The Farrars will be here
in two days.

915
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:38,810
I can't receive them in a house
with no one to run it.

916
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:41,350
Get one of the footmen
to cover his duties.

917
00:53:41,410 --> 00:53:42,470
One of the footmen?

918
00:53:42,550 --> 00:53:44,810
After all the hospitality
I've had from them?

919
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:46,250
My mind is made up.

920
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:48,310
But you don't understand!
The Greshams are coming!

921
00:53:48,390 --> 00:53:50,750
The Carberys are coming!
The Northbrooks are coming!

922
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:52,650
It'll be a disaster!
Put them off.

923
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:54,690
Put them off?

924
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:57,420
Do you know how long it's taken
me to get them to say yes?

925
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:58,860
They've never been here before.

926
00:53:59,130 --> 00:54:00,330
I hardly know them.

927
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:02,300
What will they think of me
if the house is in chaos?

928
00:54:02,370 --> 00:54:04,700
Why do you invite people
you don't know?

929
00:54:04,770 --> 00:54:08,440
Because, Thomas, I'm trying
to build something.

930
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:10,170
I'm trying to make
a life for myself.

931
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:11,570
Isn't that what you want?

932
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:13,470
And now you disgrace me.
Why?

933
00:54:13,550 --> 00:54:15,710
What have I done?

934
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:18,150
Well, I'm sure you'll manage.

935
00:54:20,850 --> 00:54:25,320
I could work out my notice, sir,

936
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:27,790
if you'd let me...

937
00:54:27,860 --> 00:54:30,420
just until you find
someone else to take over.

938
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:31,660
Out of the question.

939
00:54:31,730 --> 00:54:34,330
Surely I'm entitled
to one favour, Thomas.

940
00:54:34,330 --> 00:54:36,270
And after all the time
Caxton's been with us,

941
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:37,800
is it so much to ask?

942
00:54:37,870 --> 00:54:39,840
It is.

943
00:54:41,710 --> 00:54:44,180
The answer's no.

944
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:52,320
I feel as if I'm in a crow's
nest, looking out to sea.

945
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:55,650
When I was little, I wanted
to be a sailor just like papa.

946
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:56,850
Not anymore?

947
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:59,320
I'm blind, and I'm female.

948
00:54:59,390 --> 00:55:01,360
I doubt the Navy
has a place for me.

949
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:03,260
Then why not be
a great explorer.

950
00:55:03,330 --> 00:55:04,630
And cross all seven seas?

951
00:55:04,630 --> 00:55:06,260
Do you really think I could?

952
00:55:06,330 --> 00:55:08,630
Someone will. Why not you?

953
00:55:08,630 --> 00:55:12,240
Jacob, nothing's impossible,
is it?

954
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,730
Not when you really want it?

955
00:55:14,810 --> 00:55:16,470
What are you doing?

956
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:19,600
I'm carving our initials,
Miss Susan,

957
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:21,410
so one day they'll find them,
and then they can say,

958
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:23,780
"'that's the famous lady traveller

959
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:25,180
and her faithful companion."

960
00:55:29,550 --> 00:55:32,280
I wonder what Sefton would say
if he could see us up here.

961
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:34,620
Yep. I wonder.

962
00:55:36,430 --> 00:55:37,520
Thank you, sir.

963
00:55:41,770 --> 00:55:44,260
If I hear of anymore
such incidents, Maria,

964
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:45,390
I will hold you to blame.

965
00:55:45,470 --> 00:55:46,400
Do you understand me?

966
00:55:46,470 --> 00:55:47,560
Oh, perfectly.

967
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:49,440
I'd be amazed
if you didn't blame me.

968
00:55:50,610 --> 00:55:53,340
Maria, my dear,
you mustn't think that I...

969
00:55:53,410 --> 00:55:55,780
no, that's right.
I mustn't think.

970
00:55:55,850 --> 00:55:57,710
I mustn't think, or I'll go mad.

971
00:55:57,780 --> 00:55:59,980
I mustn't think
that you'll leave me alone.

972
00:56:00,250 --> 00:56:01,740
In this desert
for months and years.

973
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:04,310
While you swan round Europe
playing tag with the French.

974
00:56:04,390 --> 00:56:06,790
There must be something
you can do besides gambling.

975
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:08,990
And what would that be, pray?

976
00:56:09,260 --> 00:56:11,990
Paying calls on neighbours
who don't like me,

977
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:15,300
who find me funny and foreign
and not to be trusted?

978
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:17,630
Or should I stay home
painting fans,

979
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:19,570
knotting lace,
helping the vicar?

980
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:20,800
Yes, I see what you mean.

981
00:56:20,870 --> 00:56:22,530
I don't want you to be bored.

982
00:56:22,610 --> 00:56:24,510
Then you're doomed
to disappointment.

983
00:56:29,310 --> 00:56:31,010
We both are.

984
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:35,310
The truth is, my dear,
we're not well matched.

985
00:56:35,390 --> 00:56:37,510
Which is my fault, I presume?

986
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:48,370
The fault is with neither
or both of us.

987
00:56:48,430 --> 00:56:53,470
We thought we could be happy,
but we're not,

988
00:56:53,470 --> 00:56:55,700
and it's too late now
for regrets.

989
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:07,350
Who's that climbing with Jacob
in the oak tree?

990
00:57:07,350 --> 00:57:08,880
He should be looking
after Susan,

991
00:57:08,950 --> 00:57:11,490
not larking about with some boy
from the village,

992
00:57:11,490 --> 00:57:12,860
and why does Boggis allow it?

993
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:14,050
What are they playing at?

994
00:57:14,330 --> 00:57:15,350
Village boy?

995
00:57:15,430 --> 00:57:17,990
Don't you recognize
your ladylike daughter?

996
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:21,330
It can't be.

997
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:23,990
If you mean it shouldn't be,
I quite agree with you.

998
00:57:24,070 --> 00:57:25,700
But how can she? She's...

999
00:57:25,770 --> 00:57:26,740
blind?

1000
00:57:26,810 --> 00:57:27,900
Oh, my dear,

1001
00:57:27,970 --> 00:57:30,340
that doesn't get in the way
of anything these days.

1002
00:57:30,410 --> 00:57:31,570
Was this what you wanted.

1003
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:33,870
When you brought
that foundling into our home?

1004
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:37,980
Susan!

1005
00:57:39,850 --> 00:57:41,650
Over here!

1006
00:57:41,650 --> 00:57:44,780
Father? Oh, don't be angry.

1007
00:57:44,860 --> 00:57:46,590
You can't climb a tree
in a stupid dress.

1008
00:57:46,660 --> 00:57:47,900
Trousers
are much more sensible.

1009
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:49,390
Give me 10 minutes to change,

1010
00:57:49,390 --> 00:57:51,420
and I shall look like
a model lady, I promise.

1011
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:52,830
She's a good climber, sir.

1012
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:54,800
And the clothes were my idea.

1013
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:55,800
Come here.

1014
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:56,830
Say you're not cross,
please, papa.

1015
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:58,870
At any rate, not with her, sir.

1016
00:57:58,940 --> 00:58:02,430
I'm not cross.

1017
00:58:02,510 --> 00:58:05,870
I'm not cross at all.

1018
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:08,740
I'm not cross with any of you.

1019
00:58:16,690 --> 00:58:20,020
So, was everything all right
after Caxton had gone?

1020
00:58:20,090 --> 00:58:22,890
No, I'm afraid not...
because he hadn't gone.

1021
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:24,100
He was still there.

1022
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:26,830
When a messenger came
later that same day,

1023
00:58:26,830 --> 00:58:29,100
calling the captain
back to his ship.

1024
00:58:29,170 --> 00:58:31,640
Oh, custard.

1025
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:33,900
He should have waited
until Caxton left.

1026
00:58:33,970 --> 00:58:37,930
Oh, my dear, any sailor summoned
to the wars must go.

1027
00:58:42,450 --> 00:58:44,940
Caxton! Hurry, they're here!

1028
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:48,550
Everything's ready, ma'am.

1029
00:59:12,710 --> 00:59:15,700
Sefton. How are you?

1030
00:59:15,780 --> 00:59:18,080
If you'd all like to go
to your rooms,

1031
00:59:18,150 --> 00:59:20,020
we'll have tea in here at 5:00.

1032
00:59:20,020 --> 00:59:23,450
Nellie, tell Miss Susan
to join us.

1033
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:25,550
And put her into the dress
that matches this one.

1034
00:59:25,620 --> 00:59:26,680
And Jacob, ma'am?

1035
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:28,890
Oh, send him back
to the stables.

1036
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:30,990
We won't need him again today.

1037
00:59:42,910 --> 00:59:45,470
Miss Susan, your mother
wants you to join her.

1038
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:46,910
Come and change your frock.

1039
00:59:46,910 --> 00:59:47,900
Not you, Jacob.

1040
00:59:47,980 --> 00:59:49,920
There's some tea
in the kitchen.

1041
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:53,750
I hate the way she treats you.

1042
00:59:53,820 --> 00:59:55,620
Go.

1043
01:00:04,230 --> 01:00:05,750
Susan, over here.

1044
01:00:07,570 --> 01:00:11,130
Can this charming newcomer
be dear little Susan?

1045
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:13,070
Curtsey to Lord Farrar, dear.

1046
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:18,470
Oh!

1047
01:00:18,540 --> 01:00:20,200
A fine snub for you, my lord.

1048
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:22,610
My sister meant
no insult, Mrs. Carbery.

1049
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:24,220
She's quite blind.

1050
01:00:24,220 --> 01:00:26,210
Oh, dear. I'm sorry
to hear that, Mrs. Oldknow.

1051
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:28,950
I don't recall you ever
mentioning it before.

1052
01:00:28,950 --> 01:00:30,620
How vexing for you.

1053
01:00:30,690 --> 01:00:32,990
You're right, Mrs. Carbery.

1054
01:00:33,060 --> 01:00:36,930
To have a child born blind
is very vexing.

1055
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,100
Come here, my dear. Sit by me.

1056
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:40,970
Of course.

1057
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:42,230
Aah! Oh, lord!

1058
01:00:42,230 --> 01:00:43,630
Jacob!

1059
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:45,830
Is she all right?

1060
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:46,840
Oh, my dear.

1061
01:00:46,910 --> 01:00:48,110
Don't worry. I'm here.

1062
01:00:48,110 --> 01:00:50,010
Jacob, I thought you were told
to go back to the stables.

1063
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:51,800
Beg pardon, ma'am,

1064
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:54,200
but the captain likes me to keep
a close eye on Miss Susan,

1065
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:56,850
if that's no bother to anyone.

1066
01:00:56,850 --> 01:00:59,720
Bravo! I wish I had someone
to keep me out of mischief.

1067
01:00:59,780 --> 01:01:02,250
Your wife will manage that,
surely, my lord.

1068
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:05,520
I'm afraid it would take up
too much of her time.

1069
01:01:05,590 --> 01:01:07,790
You've found yourself
quite a champion, Susan.

1070
01:01:07,860 --> 01:01:08,830
I think so.

1071
01:01:08,890 --> 01:01:10,730
I'm sure all the ladies
in the room.

1072
01:01:10,730 --> 01:01:11,960
Envy you your protector.

1073
01:01:12,030 --> 01:01:13,130
That's enough, Susan.

1074
01:01:13,130 --> 01:01:14,960
You'll wear us out
with your chatter.

1075
01:01:15,030 --> 01:01:16,260
Go along.

1076
01:01:16,330 --> 01:01:19,600
We hope to see you later on...
and your gallant knight.

1077
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:22,070
Childrenare a blessing,
of course,

1078
01:01:22,140 --> 01:01:24,670
but I confess to some relief
that mine are grown and gone.

1079
01:01:25,910 --> 01:01:28,150
Heaven knows their incessant
babble and fidget.

1080
01:01:28,150 --> 01:01:30,580
Would try the patience of job.

1081
01:01:30,650 --> 01:01:33,310
I believe Jesus was very fond
of their company,

1082
01:01:33,590 --> 01:01:35,950
but of course he and Joseph
were only carpenters,

1083
01:01:36,020 --> 01:01:37,720
not nearly such fine folk as we.

1084
01:01:40,190 --> 01:01:41,320
If you'll excuse me,

1085
01:01:41,590 --> 01:01:44,160
I have some things to see to
before we go up to dress.

1086
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:45,860
We dine at 8:00.

1087
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:49,170
You are a minx, Lady Gresham.

1088
01:01:50,170 --> 01:01:52,100
She'd worked so hard.

1089
01:01:52,170 --> 01:01:54,870
To bring these people
to Green Knowe,

1090
01:01:54,940 --> 01:01:58,170
and they patronized her
from the moment they arrived.

1091
01:01:58,240 --> 01:01:59,640
I've changed my mind.

1092
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:01,700
I'll wear the rose taffeta tonight.

1093
01:02:01,780 --> 01:02:02,710
Ma'am.

1094
01:02:02,780 --> 01:02:05,650
Keep the blue silk for tomorrow.

1095
01:02:05,650 --> 01:02:06,780
And the rubies...

1096
01:02:06,850 --> 01:02:08,280
the ones in gold filigree,
not the diamond setting.

1097
01:02:08,350 --> 01:02:09,680
Yes, ma'am.

1098
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:37,150
Oh, my heaven!

1099
01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:38,840
Madam, come quick!

1100
01:02:44,420 --> 01:02:46,980
Aah!

1101
01:02:47,060 --> 01:02:48,230
Caxton was the thief.

1102
01:02:48,230 --> 01:02:51,020
He decided to steal them
the moment he was sacked.

1103
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:53,030
That's why he
wanted to stay on.

1104
01:02:53,100 --> 01:02:54,900
Well, they shredded his room.

1105
01:02:54,970 --> 01:02:56,260
They never found a thing.

1106
01:02:56,330 --> 01:02:58,360
And then it was too late.

1107
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:27,660
Maria should have cancelled
the rest of the party,

1108
01:03:27,730 --> 01:03:30,670
but the crime
had to be dealt with,

1109
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:32,360
and the guests were reluctant

1110
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:36,430
to embark on another long
journey at once.

1111
01:03:36,710 --> 01:03:39,300
All of which meant
that 2 days later,

1112
01:03:39,380 --> 01:03:42,710
14 of them sat down to dine.

1113
01:03:42,780 --> 01:03:45,340
Your loss hasn't spoiled
your guest's appetite.

1114
01:03:45,420 --> 01:03:49,790
We all know there's pleasure
in a friend's misfortune.

1115
01:03:49,850 --> 01:03:51,820
The Germans even
have a name for it.

1116
01:03:51,890 --> 01:03:54,160
Perhaps you can win
something back tonight...

1117
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:55,250
with a little luck.

1118
01:03:56,760 --> 01:03:59,060
In truth, I don't feel
very lucky this evening...

1119
01:03:59,130 --> 01:04:01,830
in anything.

1120
01:04:01,900 --> 01:04:03,300
I'm told we're all
to be questioned tomorrow,

1121
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:05,330
and all the servants.

1122
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:07,370
My maid is beside herself.

1123
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:09,310
It seems rather unnecessary.

1124
01:04:09,310 --> 01:04:11,430
But perfectly thrilling.

1125
01:04:11,510 --> 01:04:14,180
Our poor hostess is a spectre
at her own feast.

1126
01:04:14,180 --> 01:04:15,310
I'm relieved to know...

1127
01:04:15,310 --> 01:04:17,920
something can disturb
her infinite refinement.

1128
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:19,440
Surely you must
pity her a little?

1129
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:20,920
It's hard to pity a woman...

1130
01:04:20,990 --> 01:04:23,460
who cares more for her jewels
than for her child.

1131
01:04:23,460 --> 01:04:26,420
What is it, Caxton?

1132
01:04:26,490 --> 01:04:28,390
Caxton, what's the matter?

1133
01:04:31,060 --> 01:04:33,060
I'm sorry to have
to tell you, madam,

1134
01:04:33,060 --> 01:04:35,970
but... the house is on fire.

1135
01:04:36,030 --> 01:04:38,030
What?!

1136
01:04:46,210 --> 01:04:48,510
What's that noise?

1137
01:04:48,780 --> 01:04:50,480
Your lordship, don't!

1138
01:04:58,360 --> 01:04:59,950
Oh!

1139
01:05:00,020 --> 01:05:01,510
You, man, open the window!

1140
01:05:03,390 --> 01:05:06,230
Northwood! Gresham!
Get outside and help the ladies!

1141
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:08,100
Quickly! Jonathan, help me!

1142
01:05:08,100 --> 01:05:09,160
Ooh!

1143
01:05:09,230 --> 01:05:11,830
Thomas, help me.

1144
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:17,110
Mrs. Oldknow,
I hate to hurry you,

1145
01:05:17,110 --> 01:05:18,270
but I really do think.

1146
01:05:18,340 --> 01:05:20,540
We'd find it more congenial
on the lawn.

1147
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:26,280
Get out of my way.

1148
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:28,310
"Susan by Jacob."

1149
01:06:28,310 --> 01:06:30,840
Arthur, George!
The house is on fire!

1150
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:32,180
Wake all the men.

1151
01:06:32,180 --> 01:06:34,220
And bring all the buckets
you can lay your hands on!

1152
01:06:34,250 --> 01:06:36,350
The house is on fire!

1153
01:06:36,420 --> 01:06:38,460
Jacob! What's going on?

1154
01:06:38,460 --> 01:06:39,450
Jacob!

1155
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:42,150
Let's get all the buckets
we can, lads!

1156
01:06:42,230 --> 01:06:44,630
Jacob, wake up! Jacob!

1157
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:46,020
What is it? What's happening?

1158
01:06:46,030 --> 01:06:47,110
The house is on fire. What?

1159
01:06:47,130 --> 01:06:48,430
Look!

1160
01:06:48,500 --> 01:06:49,560
Susan!

1161
01:07:00,210 --> 01:07:02,240
The servants know the
house better than we do,

1162
01:07:02,310 --> 01:07:05,510
so leave them to rescue
the contents.

1163
01:07:05,580 --> 01:07:08,620
Are there any sacks
and buckets to be had?

1164
01:07:08,620 --> 01:07:10,220
Fred Boggis has gone to get some.

1165
01:07:10,250 --> 01:07:11,550
What's happening?

1166
01:07:11,620 --> 01:07:15,220
We can slow it up if we
form a chain to the pond!

1167
01:07:15,290 --> 01:07:18,390
Then we shall have to hold it
back as best we can!

1168
01:07:18,460 --> 01:07:20,100
Why isn't anybody
doing anything?!

1169
01:07:20,100 --> 01:07:22,460
Come on! Hurry up!
Quickly, quickly, lads!

1170
01:07:22,530 --> 01:07:24,500
Ma'am! Ma'am!

1171
01:07:24,570 --> 01:07:25,900
Oh, I'm mad!

1172
01:07:25,970 --> 01:07:27,630
I should have told the men
to take the Vermeer!

1173
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:30,000
Caxton, Caxton, can you see if...

1174
01:07:31,110 --> 01:07:32,380
Where you going?

1175
01:07:32,380 --> 01:07:34,380
Over here! Quickly, come on!

1176
01:07:34,380 --> 01:07:38,180
Susan? Where's Miss Susan?

1177
01:07:38,250 --> 01:07:39,380
Where's the child?

1178
01:07:39,450 --> 01:07:40,420
Mrs. Oldknow?

1179
01:07:40,490 --> 01:07:42,650
Maria, is she still in the house?

1180
01:07:42,650 --> 01:07:44,260
No, no, no, she can't be.
She won't be...

1181
01:07:44,290 --> 01:07:45,250
well, then where is she?

1182
01:07:45,290 --> 01:07:47,020
I don't know. Sefton will know.

1183
01:07:47,090 --> 01:07:48,060
Have you seen Susan?

1184
01:07:48,130 --> 01:07:49,090
Where would Nellie
have taken her?

1185
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:50,150
I don't know.

1186
01:07:50,230 --> 01:07:52,530
Find Mrs. Gross.
Find Mrs. Gross.

1187
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:53,960
Come on! Hurry up!

1188
01:07:54,030 --> 01:07:55,120
Oh, no!

1189
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:56,430
Why are they bothering
with that for?!

1190
01:07:56,500 --> 01:07:58,490
It's not worth the canvas
it's painted on!

1191
01:07:58,570 --> 01:08:01,060
You come with me.

1192
01:08:01,140 --> 01:08:04,230
Did anyone bring out
the bowls?!

1193
01:08:04,310 --> 01:08:06,210
Nellie. It's Nellie.

1194
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:07,400
Have you seen Susan?

1195
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:09,280
I was in the kitchen
when it started.

1196
01:08:09,350 --> 01:08:11,020
Somebody told me
she'd come down.

1197
01:08:11,020 --> 01:08:12,150
Stop that. Just tell me
where her room is.

1198
01:08:12,150 --> 01:08:13,080
I know.

1199
01:08:16,020 --> 01:08:17,110
Get a ladder, somebody!

1200
01:08:17,190 --> 01:08:20,020
No, Lady. No one could
climb a ladder through that.

1201
01:08:20,020 --> 01:08:21,080
Well, a blanket, then.

1202
01:08:21,160 --> 01:08:22,390
We can hold both ends and...

1203
01:08:22,460 --> 01:08:25,260
I know away.

1204
01:08:25,330 --> 01:08:26,260
You can't go in there!

1205
01:08:26,330 --> 01:08:27,390
Yes, I can! I know how!

1206
01:08:27,470 --> 01:08:29,430
Mr. Sefton taught me!

1207
01:08:29,500 --> 01:08:33,490
Robert! Did anybody save
the plates in the dining room?

1208
01:08:33,570 --> 01:08:35,560
Mr. Caxton had most of it
in a sack,

1209
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:37,200
but I've not seen him since.

1210
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:19,710
Whoa!

1211
01:09:28,630 --> 01:09:30,060
Aah!

1212
01:09:38,700 --> 01:09:39,690
Susan.

1213
01:09:39,770 --> 01:09:41,200
Jacob, is that you?

1214
01:09:41,270 --> 01:09:42,200
It's me.

1215
01:09:42,270 --> 01:09:44,760
Oh, I knew you'd come.
I knew it.

1216
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:48,440
Well, I didn't, but here I am.

1217
01:09:48,510 --> 01:09:50,520
Are we going to die?
You can tell me.

1218
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:52,210
I don't mind, now you're here.

1219
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:54,440
We're all gonna die,
but if it's the same to you,

1220
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:56,110
I'd rather it wasn't right now.

1221
01:09:56,190 --> 01:09:58,260
But the window won't open
and the door's stuck.

1222
01:09:58,260 --> 01:10:00,160
And I can feel the heat
on the other side.

1223
01:10:00,220 --> 01:10:01,210
Just do what I tell you.

1224
01:10:01,290 --> 01:10:03,620
Come on, now.
Get in there and climb.

1225
01:10:22,710 --> 01:10:25,150
Wait for me and don't move.

1226
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:34,520
Aah!

1227
01:10:37,860 --> 01:10:39,390
Let's go.

1228
01:10:41,500 --> 01:10:42,700
Where are we now?

1229
01:10:42,700 --> 01:10:44,790
Coming back into the old part.

1230
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:56,270
Follow the plank.

1231
01:10:56,350 --> 01:10:58,750
Yes.

1232
01:10:58,820 --> 01:10:59,750
Now stop right there.

1233
01:11:05,660 --> 01:11:08,820
Are you ready?

1234
01:11:08,890 --> 01:11:10,760
This is the ladder.

1235
01:11:10,830 --> 01:11:12,160
There.

1236
01:11:12,230 --> 01:11:13,600
Don't be afraid.

1237
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:15,500
I'm not.

1238
01:11:19,870 --> 01:11:20,900
I've got it.

1239
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:26,610
Put your foot here.

1240
01:11:26,610 --> 01:11:27,610
I will.

1241
01:11:27,610 --> 01:11:29,200
You're almost down.

1242
01:11:38,390 --> 01:11:39,650
Mama?

1243
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:41,490
Look... it's Miss Susan.

1244
01:11:41,490 --> 01:11:42,860
He's saved Miss Susan.

1245
01:11:42,930 --> 01:11:45,420
Good lad!
Boy's all right!

1246
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:47,330
Susan.
Susan, my darling.

1247
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:50,200
Well done, guv, well done!

1248
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:53,500
By George, that was a good
night's work, young man.

1249
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:54,910
You should be proud
of yourself!

1250
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:00,870
Thank you.

1251
01:12:04,780 --> 01:12:07,310
For he's a jolly good fellow...

1252
01:12:07,390 --> 01:12:08,850
for he's a jolly good Fe...

1253
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:15,620
thank you, lord. Thank you.

1254
01:12:20,670 --> 01:12:22,190
What happened to Caxton?

1255
01:12:22,270 --> 01:12:25,360
Fred Boggis saw him run
upstairs with a sack.

1256
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:28,430
Maybe he got away with
the jewels, maybe not.

1257
01:12:28,510 --> 01:12:31,770
Either way, he was never seen
again after the fire.

1258
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:33,670
And did Maria
come to love Jacob?

1259
01:12:33,740 --> 01:12:36,540
Well, she was always kind
to him after that.

1260
01:12:43,420 --> 01:12:46,690
If you're going to have a bath
before dinner, you better go.

1261
01:12:50,730 --> 01:12:52,390
Granny? Hmm?

1262
01:12:52,460 --> 01:12:54,430
Why are you called
Mrs. Oldknow?

1263
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:57,230
If you grew up here, shouldn't
you be Mrs. something-else?

1264
01:12:57,300 --> 01:13:00,430
Your grandfather and I
were second cousins.

1265
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:02,560
So, you're more of an
Oldknow than anyone.

1266
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:04,980
You must have thought
you'd always live here.

1267
01:13:04,980 --> 01:13:07,950
Well, if I did,
I should have realized.

1268
01:13:08,010 --> 01:13:12,950
There's no such thing
as "always"...

1269
01:13:13,020 --> 01:13:15,320
not on earth.

1270
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:19,960
It's the table centre
for Christmas day.

1271
01:13:21,930 --> 01:13:24,020
Is it worth it,

1272
01:13:24,300 --> 01:13:26,730
going to all this bother
when it's just us?

1273
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:29,600
Can't have Christmas
without doing it properly.

1274
01:13:29,670 --> 01:13:31,500
Even in wartime?

1275
01:13:32,900 --> 01:13:36,500
Most of all in wartime.

1276
01:13:36,570 --> 01:13:37,700
News.

1277
01:13:42,510 --> 01:13:44,880
I wish it'd just stop ending
and just end.

1278
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:46,350
Shh, shh, shh.

1279
01:13:46,350 --> 01:13:47,620
General de Gaulle
has issued a statement.

1280
01:13:47,620 --> 01:13:49,280
Welcoming the Russian
advance on Berlin.

1281
01:13:49,350 --> 01:13:50,620
France is free again.

1282
01:13:50,620 --> 01:13:52,490
In the wake of the
French-Soviet treaty, signed...

1283
01:13:52,490 --> 01:13:54,580
the Russians are moving in.

1284
01:13:54,660 --> 01:13:56,820
It won't be long.
We're nearly there.

1285
01:13:56,890 --> 01:13:58,920
...when faced
by a common enemy.

1286
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,660
If you were a prisoner
in Germany.

1287
01:14:00,730 --> 01:14:02,370
And no one knew where you were,

1288
01:14:02,370 --> 01:14:03,860
I think you might be
released now.

1289
01:14:03,930 --> 01:14:06,930
...when they invest and capture
the city. At home...

1290
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,400
Why not see what
Boggis is up to?

1291
01:14:09,470 --> 01:14:11,510
Lovely day.

1292
01:14:11,510 --> 01:14:13,070
Shame to waste it.

1293
01:14:13,340 --> 01:14:15,780
...and so well against
the devastation.

1294
01:14:15,850 --> 01:14:17,640
Visited on them
by the German bombing...

1295
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:24,060
I know what you're thinking,
but you'll see.

1296
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:26,650
...they had conferred
on the city, the queen replied,

1297
01:14:26,720 --> 01:14:29,060
"it is we who are
honoured to be here."

1298
01:14:29,060 --> 01:14:31,460
do you have a holiday at all?

1299
01:14:31,530 --> 01:14:34,520
Plants don't know
it's Christmas, do they?

1300
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:37,470
But you'll take Christmas day
itself off, though, won't you?

1301
01:14:41,810 --> 01:14:44,370
I shall go back early
for me dinner.

1302
01:14:47,140 --> 01:14:48,810
That'll be soon enough.

1303
01:14:48,810 --> 01:14:51,940
What about Mrs. Boggis?
Won't she be lonely?

1304
01:14:55,690 --> 01:14:57,650
That'll be soon enough.

1305
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:06,700
Telegram for Mrs. Oldknow.

1306
01:15:06,700 --> 01:15:08,430
Thank you.

1307
01:15:11,570 --> 01:15:13,470
Shall I wait for an answer?

1308
01:15:13,540 --> 01:15:15,770
No. No, don't wait.

1309
01:15:32,120 --> 01:15:34,060
Telegram.

1310
01:15:37,530 --> 01:15:40,120
What rooms did they make
the music room from?

1311
01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:44,400
Two downstairs rooms, I think,

1312
01:15:44,470 --> 01:15:46,440
with some
little bedrooms above.

1313
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:50,030
Low servants' room, but they
give it a fine, high ceiling.

1314
01:15:50,110 --> 01:15:52,140
Is that narrow one the
music-room chimney?

1315
01:15:52,140 --> 01:15:54,840
No. No, no, that goes up
through the main stack,

1316
01:15:54,910 --> 01:15:56,610
with one from the great hall.

1317
01:15:56,610 --> 01:15:57,740
Well, what is it, then?

1318
01:15:57,820 --> 01:16:01,410
Why, leftover from before
the changes, I suppose.

1319
01:16:01,490 --> 01:16:05,110
Too much trouble
to take it away.

1320
01:16:05,190 --> 01:16:07,750
Tolly! Tolly!

1321
01:16:07,830 --> 01:16:09,550
Tolly!

1322
01:16:09,630 --> 01:16:10,890
Come. Come.

1323
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:22,770
It's a telegram
from your mother.

1324
01:16:22,770 --> 01:16:24,500
She's coming down to see us.

1325
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:25,540
When?

1326
01:16:25,610 --> 01:16:26,910
Tomorrow.

1327
01:16:26,980 --> 01:16:29,070
Is she staying for Christmas?

1328
01:16:29,150 --> 01:16:32,780
I don't know. You read it.

1329
01:16:32,850 --> 01:16:36,010
"Arriving tomorriow STOP Joan"

1330
01:16:36,090 --> 01:16:38,020
why don't we ring her?

1331
01:16:38,090 --> 01:16:40,610
I've tried. There's no reply.

1332
01:16:41,790 --> 01:16:43,050
Well, whatever it is,

1333
01:16:43,130 --> 01:16:45,060
she obviously doesn't want
to say it over the telephone.

1334
01:16:45,130 --> 01:16:47,620
At least we haven't long
to wait.

1335
01:16:49,970 --> 01:16:52,730
You'll be glad to see your mum.

1336
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:54,860
Oh, I got something for you.

1337
01:16:56,670 --> 01:16:59,070
Thank you.

1338
01:16:59,140 --> 01:17:01,540
Heard how yours was lost.

1339
01:17:02,950 --> 01:17:05,510
I've been thinking some more
about the jewels.

1340
01:17:05,580 --> 01:17:08,110
Oh! You and your questions.

1341
01:17:08,190 --> 01:17:10,150
Did Maria just give up?

1342
01:17:10,220 --> 01:17:11,950
Oh, not a bit of it.

1343
01:17:12,020 --> 01:17:13,580
This is absurd.

1344
01:17:13,660 --> 01:17:14,590
Without my jewels,

1345
01:17:14,660 --> 01:17:16,560
I'm a prisoner
to the end of my days.

1346
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:18,220
Just to accept that
would be absurd.

1347
01:17:35,750 --> 01:17:38,010
I want to learn
if I can recover my...

1348
01:17:39,550 --> 01:17:41,950
I know why you're here.

1349
01:17:44,790 --> 01:17:47,990
You must embroider
a picture of the house.

1350
01:17:47,990 --> 01:17:50,930
The thing is, I am rather busy.

1351
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,760
Surely if I ask my maid...

1352
01:17:52,830 --> 01:17:56,130
you must embroider the house.

1353
01:17:56,200 --> 01:17:58,900
Oh. Very well, then.

1354
01:17:58,970 --> 01:18:01,610
And you will use human hair.

1355
01:18:01,610 --> 01:18:03,800
How perfectly disgusting!

1356
01:18:03,870 --> 01:18:04,970
Taken from the heads.

1357
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:07,750
Of everyone who was there
on the night.

1358
01:18:07,750 --> 01:18:08,730
How could I?

1359
01:18:08,810 --> 01:18:10,870
We were 14 at the party,
and I've no idea...

1360
01:18:10,950 --> 01:18:12,610
not just the guests...

1361
01:18:12,680 --> 01:18:15,620
the servants,
the guests' servants,

1362
01:18:15,620 --> 01:18:19,020
the villagers, whoever
came to help, everyone.

1363
01:18:19,020 --> 01:18:20,220
Well, that's impossible.

1364
01:18:20,290 --> 01:18:25,790
The hair will tell you where
the jewels are to be found.

1365
01:18:27,300 --> 01:18:30,630
Even if I do this,
would I know how to read it?

1366
01:18:30,630 --> 01:18:32,000
That I cannot tell you.

1367
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:38,300
Seems a lot of nasty work
for a very uncertain result.

1368
01:18:38,380 --> 01:18:39,570
I have no other answer.

1369
01:18:39,640 --> 01:18:41,700
But why does it have to be me?

1370
01:18:41,780 --> 01:18:44,840
Because, Mrs. Oldknow,

1371
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:49,010
you have overplayed your hand.

1372
01:18:51,660 --> 01:18:53,320
How did Maria get all the hair?

1373
01:18:53,390 --> 01:18:55,790
With a lot of difficulty.

1374
01:18:55,860 --> 01:18:56,950
The word went' round.

1375
01:18:57,030 --> 01:18:59,660
In the end, everyone helped,
except Lady Farrar.

1376
01:18:59,660 --> 01:19:01,720
She refused, point-blank.

1377
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:03,270
So, what happened?

1378
01:19:03,330 --> 01:19:06,830
Her husband found some
on her hairbrush.

1379
01:19:06,900 --> 01:19:09,630
I think he rather liked Maria.

1380
01:19:09,710 --> 01:19:11,200
Does the picture still exist?

1381
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:13,040
Yes, it's that one, there.

1382
01:19:19,380 --> 01:19:20,910
Which is Susan's?

1383
01:19:20,980 --> 01:19:22,320
Oh, hers is easy.

1384
01:19:22,390 --> 01:19:25,620
'cause it was long,
Maria used it for the trees.

1385
01:19:25,690 --> 01:19:26,960
And Jacob's?

1386
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:28,820
Well, his was short.

1387
01:19:28,890 --> 01:19:31,790
In the end, she sewed that
little bird with it. See?

1388
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:36,060
But it didn't deliver
the jewels?

1389
01:19:36,130 --> 01:19:39,970
Five generations of Oldknows
have stared at that picture.

1390
01:19:39,970 --> 01:19:41,370
And never found the clue.

1391
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:43,130
Maybe it was a trick.

1392
01:19:43,210 --> 01:19:46,200
Of course it didn't work.
Caxton's was missing.

1393
01:19:46,280 --> 01:19:47,880
Without his, the picture
wasn't finished.

1394
01:19:47,950 --> 01:19:49,710
No, it was.

1395
01:19:49,710 --> 01:19:52,120
He'd given a lock of hair
to someone he was keen on.

1396
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:54,020
Maria?

1397
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:56,140
Oh, certainly not...
a housemaid.

1398
01:19:56,220 --> 01:19:57,650
Why did you say that?

1399
01:19:57,720 --> 01:19:58,980
No reason.

1400
01:19:59,060 --> 01:20:01,320
Anyway, Maria used it
for a chimney.

1401
01:20:01,390 --> 01:20:03,090
I think it's that one there.

1402
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:06,400
There wasn't much of it.
Come on.

1403
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:09,390
Into bed and don't
read too long.

1404
01:20:09,470 --> 01:20:12,270
You don't want to be tired
for your mother tomorrow.

1405
01:20:12,270 --> 01:20:14,290
Granny? Hmm?

1406
01:20:14,370 --> 01:20:17,070
Can you be nice to her
when she gets here?

1407
01:20:17,140 --> 01:20:18,230
Please?

1408
01:20:18,310 --> 01:20:21,150
Oh.

1409
01:20:21,150 --> 01:20:24,270
You make me
feel rather ashamed.

1410
01:20:24,350 --> 01:20:27,010
Of course I'll be nice to her.

1411
01:20:27,080 --> 01:20:31,350
'cause we all love dad,
don't we, all three of us?

1412
01:20:31,420 --> 01:20:35,450
I know he'd like it if we're all
getting along when he comes back.

1413
01:20:35,730 --> 01:20:37,850
Yes, of course he would.

1414
01:20:37,930 --> 01:20:40,330
I think she's found him.

1415
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:42,170
I think she knows where he is.

1416
01:20:42,170 --> 01:20:44,260
We mustn't raise our
hopes up too high.

1417
01:20:44,330 --> 01:20:47,930
I don't think my hopes
could get any higher.

1418
01:20:48,010 --> 01:20:51,370
No, nor mine, really.

1419
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:53,180
But...

1420
01:20:53,180 --> 01:20:54,410
but what?

1421
01:20:56,250 --> 01:20:58,110
No, never mind. Never mind.

1422
01:20:58,180 --> 01:21:00,740
We'll cross that bridge
when we come to it.

1423
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:04,410
Tolly? Yes?

1424
01:21:04,490 --> 01:21:10,190
If you have children,
don't ever quarrel with them.

1425
01:21:10,260 --> 01:21:14,470
No matter the reason,
no matter how angry you get...

1426
01:21:14,470 --> 01:21:16,930
don't quarrel.

1427
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:22,030
I promise you...
it's never worth it.

1428
01:21:29,250 --> 01:21:33,150
You do know I love you more
than anyone else in the world?

1429
01:21:33,220 --> 01:21:34,950
Except for daddy.

1430
01:21:35,020 --> 01:21:37,040
Except for David.

1431
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:38,850
I'm glad.

1432
01:21:38,920 --> 01:21:40,090
Good.

1433
01:21:40,090 --> 01:21:44,020
Because I wouldn't want there to
be any confusion on that score.

1434
01:21:44,090 --> 01:21:45,530
Good night.

1435
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:48,770
Night.

1436
01:22:08,190 --> 01:22:11,250
Maria used it for one
of the chimneys.

1437
01:22:13,560 --> 01:22:15,860
Low servants' room,

1438
01:22:15,860 --> 01:22:19,350
but they give it
a fine, high ceiling.

1439
01:22:19,430 --> 01:22:22,920
Fred Boggis saw him
run upstairs with a sack.

1440
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:25,870
Maybe he got away
with the jewels, maybe not.

1441
01:22:25,940 --> 01:22:27,870
Get out of my way!

1442
01:22:27,870 --> 01:22:30,270
Don't go up there!
That staircase is going!

1443
01:22:30,340 --> 01:22:31,400
You won't get back!

1444
01:22:31,480 --> 01:22:32,410
Of course.

1445
01:23:38,110 --> 01:23:41,040
Thank you for helping us
with Fred.

1446
01:23:41,110 --> 01:23:43,070
I don't know what we should
have done without you.

1447
01:23:43,110 --> 01:23:44,170
I heard he was all right.

1448
01:23:44,250 --> 01:23:45,940
Oh, yes, he never
left Green Knowe.

1449
01:23:46,020 --> 01:23:48,610
He married
a kitchen maid... Rose.

1450
01:23:48,690 --> 01:23:49,650
I thought he might.

1451
01:23:56,630 --> 01:23:58,530
He can't hurt you.

1452
01:23:58,600 --> 01:24:00,460
Did he start the fire?

1453
01:24:00,530 --> 01:24:03,260
He meant to start it
in revenge and go.

1454
01:24:03,330 --> 01:24:05,600
He had the jewels,
but the silver tempted him,

1455
01:24:05,670 --> 01:24:07,100
and then the gold.

1456
01:24:07,100 --> 01:24:10,010
He'd gone back up to hide it
in the chimney of his room.

1457
01:24:10,070 --> 01:24:12,440
When the fire took him,
but nobody ever knew.

1458
01:24:12,510 --> 01:24:14,370
You know.

1459
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:16,380
I know now.

1460
01:24:16,450 --> 01:24:19,070
You're looking for the one
behind you,

1461
01:24:19,150 --> 01:24:21,120
the one with the rope.

1462
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:23,180
The next one
serves the music room,

1463
01:24:23,250 --> 01:24:25,650
but you want the disused chimney
beyond that arch.

1464
01:24:25,720 --> 01:24:27,690
It's blocked by the
new ceiling below.

1465
01:24:30,030 --> 01:24:32,260
Thank you for helping us.

1466
01:24:32,330 --> 01:24:34,350
Thank you.

1467
01:25:18,310 --> 01:25:20,170
Tolly!

1468
01:25:20,240 --> 01:25:21,440
What on earth
have you been doing?

1469
01:25:21,510 --> 01:25:22,670
You've got to come to the music
room now... quickly.

1470
01:25:22,750 --> 01:25:25,050
Come on. What are you doing?

1471
01:25:25,050 --> 01:25:26,980
What have you been doing
with yourself?

1472
01:25:27,050 --> 01:25:27,710
You're black!

1473
01:25:29,420 --> 01:25:31,250
How did you find it?

1474
01:25:31,320 --> 01:25:33,060
Susan helped me...

1475
01:25:33,060 --> 01:25:37,520
and the picture and
Mr. Boggis and even you.

1476
01:25:37,590 --> 01:25:40,220
That doesn't look like much.

1477
01:25:41,670 --> 01:25:44,000
But these...
these are our silver plates.

1478
01:25:44,070 --> 01:25:46,660
Look.
Look... there's our crest.

1479
01:25:56,350 --> 01:25:58,250
Oh, Tolly.

1480
01:26:06,160 --> 01:26:07,210
Fetch a table.

1481
01:26:14,660 --> 01:26:15,630
Oh, Tolly.

1482
01:26:15,700 --> 01:26:17,630
Oh, look...
it's Maria's necklace,

1483
01:26:17,700 --> 01:26:19,100
the one in the portrait.

1484
01:26:20,270 --> 01:26:22,470
Oh, my. Rubies.

1485
01:26:22,540 --> 01:26:25,270
Oh! Oh, Tolly.

1486
01:26:26,510 --> 01:26:27,530
Does it suit me?

1487
01:26:28,680 --> 01:26:30,310
Oh, look!

1488
01:26:30,380 --> 01:26:32,750
I've never seen so many jewels!

1489
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:39,580
What do you think?

1490
01:26:39,660 --> 01:26:40,550
Try this.

1491
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:48,260
Look at all these bracelets.

1492
01:26:50,300 --> 01:26:51,800
Oh, my!

1493
01:26:55,140 --> 01:26:57,230
Oh, look at the rings.

1494
01:26:57,310 --> 01:27:00,330
Oh, Tolly!

1495
01:27:00,410 --> 01:27:02,340
Ouch!

1496
01:27:02,410 --> 01:27:05,470
So, Green Knowe can be saved
and everything put right?

1497
01:27:05,550 --> 01:27:10,550
It can. It most certainly can.

1498
01:27:10,550 --> 01:27:12,290
You won't sell all the jewels.

1499
01:27:12,290 --> 01:27:13,620
Don't worry.

1500
01:27:13,690 --> 01:27:17,160
You will not blush for
your mother or your wife.

1501
01:27:23,300 --> 01:27:25,670
What is it, Tolly?

1502
01:27:25,740 --> 01:27:30,170
I've been thinking
about ghosts.

1503
01:27:31,370 --> 01:27:34,180
Don't they come back...

1504
01:27:34,180 --> 01:27:36,810
if they come back...

1505
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:39,320
as they were when they died?

1506
01:27:39,320 --> 01:27:41,590
I'll just get started
on the washing-up.

1507
01:27:41,590 --> 01:27:44,520
Oh, thank you. Well...

1508
01:27:44,590 --> 01:27:45,780
don't they?

1509
01:27:45,860 --> 01:27:50,690
Well, no, not always.
But as a rule, yes.

1510
01:27:50,760 --> 01:27:53,600
Why?

1511
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:54,690
You know why.

1512
01:27:54,760 --> 01:27:57,670
I'm afraid I do.

1513
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:02,740
It's true. They died.

1514
01:28:02,810 --> 01:28:03,860
As children?

1515
01:28:03,940 --> 01:28:07,710
Well, it wasn't unusual then.

1516
01:28:10,380 --> 01:28:12,440
What did they die of?

1517
01:28:12,520 --> 01:28:15,210
It's hard to say.

1518
01:28:15,290 --> 01:28:19,720
No doubt something a pill
would cure in a week today.

1519
01:28:19,790 --> 01:28:21,650
Together?

1520
01:28:21,730 --> 01:28:24,850
Well, Susan went first.

1521
01:28:24,930 --> 01:28:29,520
And Jacob just
a few hours after,

1522
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:32,500
with the captain
holding his hand.

1523
01:28:32,570 --> 01:28:35,870
And crying his eyes out,
poor man.

1524
01:28:37,910 --> 01:28:40,810
But that makes it bearable.

1525
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:43,610
Don't you see?

1526
01:28:45,980 --> 01:28:50,480
Those children
were both truly loved.

1527
01:28:50,550 --> 01:28:52,320
So they're not sad.

1528
01:28:52,390 --> 01:28:55,650
And it's our job not
to think of them as sad.

1529
01:29:12,280 --> 01:29:13,970
What's the matter?

1530
01:29:19,420 --> 01:29:21,480
Nothing.

1531
01:29:22,750 --> 01:29:24,690
Race you back to the house!

1532
01:29:24,690 --> 01:29:26,780
That's not fair!
I wasn't ready!

1533
01:29:47,740 --> 01:29:48,730
What's that?

1534
01:29:59,460 --> 01:30:01,290
It can't be.

1535
01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:03,850
Oh, Tolly.

1536
01:30:26,820 --> 01:30:28,910
Oh, my dear.

1537
01:30:35,890 --> 01:30:38,030
There. Come.

1538
01:30:38,030 --> 01:30:40,760
Let's go inside.

1539
01:30:40,760 --> 01:30:42,790
Tolly, come on.

1540
01:30:42,870 --> 01:30:45,630
Let... let's all be together.

1541
01:30:45,700 --> 01:30:47,600
Come on.

1542
01:31:04,420 --> 01:31:05,910
Dad?

1543
01:31:05,990 --> 01:31:08,890
Dad, is that you?

1544
01:31:21,070 --> 01:31:23,510
David?

1545
01:31:23,570 --> 01:31:26,040
Don't worry.
You're gonna be okay.

1546
01:31:26,110 --> 01:31:28,670
I promise.

1547
01:31:28,750 --> 01:31:31,110
Now, come on.
The old girl's right.

1548
01:31:31,380 --> 01:31:34,420
You'll find she often is,
you know.

1549
01:31:34,420 --> 01:31:36,650
So, let's all be together.

1550
01:31:41,990 --> 01:31:46,090
Oh, Tolly, dear,
let's go inside.
