1
00:00:47,693 --> 00:00:49,611
What I love about Nicole...

2
00:00:50,279 --> 00:00:53,699
She makes people feel comfortable
about even embarrassing things.

3
00:00:54,866 --> 00:00:56,492
Hey, you look like you care about animals.

4
00:00:56,577 --> 00:00:57,411
Yes, I do.

5
00:00:57,494 --> 00:00:59,746
She really listens
when someone is talking.

6
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:01,873
-Do you want to sign up here?
-You know what? I...

7
00:01:01,957 --> 00:01:05,126
It's funny, I actually signed up for this,
but I never heard from you guys.

8
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:07,754
Sometimes she listens too much
for too long.

9
00:01:07,838 --> 00:01:09,130
Okay, if you e-mail me here —

10
00:01:09,214 --> 00:01:11,466
-Thank you so much. Have a good day.
-Good luck.

11
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:13,051
She is a good citizen.

12
00:01:14,011 --> 00:01:15,637
- Just call him.
- I'm not calling.

13
00:01:15,721 --> 00:01:19,349
She always knows the right thing to do
when it comes to difficult family shit.

14
00:01:19,433 --> 00:01:20,434
Call him.

15
00:01:24,313 --> 00:01:25,689
I get stuck in my ways,

16
00:01:25,772 --> 00:01:28,775
and she knows when to push me
and when to leave me alone.

17
00:01:32,696 --> 00:01:34,197
She cuts all our hair.

18
00:01:44,458 --> 00:01:46,042
Yeah!

19
00:01:46,126 --> 00:01:47,710
She is always inexplicably

20
00:01:47,794 --> 00:01:50,296
brewing a cup of tea
that she doesn't drink.

21
00:01:55,135 --> 00:01:57,971
And it's not easy for her
to put away a sock, or close a cabinet,

22
00:01:58,055 --> 00:02:00,474
or do a dish, but she tries for me.

23
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,100
Nicole grew up in LA around actors,
and directors, and movies, and TV,

24
00:02:06,396 --> 00:02:08,689
and is very close to her mother, Sandra,

25
00:02:08,774 --> 00:02:10,358
and Cassie, her sister.

26
00:02:11,902 --> 00:02:14,029
Note the wrapping.

27
00:02:25,999 --> 00:02:28,501
Nicole gives great presents.

28
00:02:32,631 --> 00:02:35,258
She is a mother who plays, really plays.

29
00:02:35,342 --> 00:02:36,551
-Lizard?
-Yeah.

30
00:02:37,427 --> 00:02:39,345
She never steps off playing

31
00:02:39,429 --> 00:02:41,013
or says iris too much.

32
00:02:41,098 --> 00:02:44,017
-Mom.
-And it must be too much some of the time.

33
00:02:46,103 --> 00:02:47,687
"...chopped down a Christmas tree..."

34
00:02:48,271 --> 00:02:49,105
All right.

35
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:51,482
Nice. Two, three, four... What?

36
00:02:52,776 --> 00:02:54,819
Are you kidding me? I was just in jail!

37
00:02:54,903 --> 00:02:56,195
Goddamn it!

38
00:02:56,279 --> 00:02:59,115
- Do not laugh at me! Stop it!
- She is competitive.

39
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,620
She is amazing at opening jars
because of her strong arms,

40
00:03:03,704 --> 00:03:05,706
which I've always found very sexy.

41
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:07,999
She keeps the fridge over-full.

42
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:09,918
No one is ever hungry in our house.

43
00:03:11,044 --> 00:03:12,336
She can drive a stick.

44
00:03:15,674 --> 00:03:16,633
How could you?

45
00:03:16,717 --> 00:03:18,677
After that movie, All Over The Girl,

46
00:03:19,052 --> 00:03:21,596
she could have stayed in LA
and been a movie star;

47
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,391
but she gave that up to do theater with me
in New York.

48
00:03:24,933 --> 00:03:26,976
You might as well get what you paid for.

49
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:28,603
She is brave.

50
00:03:31,898 --> 00:03:33,274
She is a great dancer.

51
00:03:33,358 --> 00:03:35,777
Infectious.
She makes me wish I could dance.

52
00:03:36,486 --> 00:03:39,947
She always says when she doesn't know
something, or hasn't read a book,

53
00:03:40,031 --> 00:03:41,407
or seen a film or a play,

54
00:03:41,491 --> 00:03:44,702
whereas I fake it or say something
like I haven't seen it in a while.

55
00:03:47,831 --> 00:03:51,668
My crazy ideas are her favorite things
to figure out how to execute.

56
00:03:57,382 --> 00:03:58,633
Let's try it...

57
00:04:00,427 --> 00:04:01,469
crawling...

58
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:05,849
but also standing.

59
00:04:06,683 --> 00:04:08,601
She is my fa favorite actress.

60
00:04:10,604 --> 00:04:12,480
What I love about Charlie...

61
00:04:13,023 --> 00:04:14,524
Charlie is undaunted

62
00:04:16,568 --> 00:04:19,279
He never lets other people’s opinions
or any setbacks

63
00:04:19,362 --> 00:04:21,072
keep him from what he wants to do.

64
00:04:22,449 --> 00:04:24,993
And he liked me, so...

65
00:04:25,076 --> 00:04:28,079
Charlie eats like he’s trying
to get it over with

66
00:04:28,163 --> 00:04:30,665
and like there won '1' be enough food
for e everyone.

67
00:04:30,749 --> 00:04:33,293
A sandwich is to be strangled
while devoured.

68
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:35,336
ls your sweater on backwards?

69
00:04:35,754 --> 00:04:39,591
But he is incredibly neat,
and I rely on him to keep things in order.

70
00:04:41,927 --> 00:04:42,844
So...

71
00:04:44,221 --> 00:04:45,555
He's energy-conscious.

72
00:04:46,389 --> 00:04:47,390
Hey.

73
00:04:49,726 --> 00:04:50,560
Sorry.

74
00:04:51,311 --> 00:04:53,313
He doesn't look in the mirror too often.

75
00:04:53,396 --> 00:04:55,022
I cried four times.

76
00:04:55,106 --> 00:04:55,940
Me too.

77
00:04:56,024 --> 00:04:57,442
He cries easily in movies.

78
00:04:57,526 --> 00:04:59,277
I wonder if it was the same four.

79
00:05:00,111 --> 00:05:02,571
He is very self-sufficient.
He can darn a sock,

80
00:05:02,656 --> 00:05:04,783
and cook himself dinner, and iron a shirt.

81
00:05:06,827 --> 00:05:08,495
How are we doing over here?

82
00:05:08,578 --> 00:05:09,745
The peppers are cut.

83
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:11,957
He rarely gets defeated, which...

84
00:05:12,624 --> 00:05:14,083
I feel like I always do.

85
00:05:14,167 --> 00:05:15,251
...cut some carrots.

86
00:05:16,878 --> 00:05:19,463
Charlie takes
all of my moods steadily.

87
00:05:19,548 --> 00:05:21,758
He doesn't give in to them
or make me feel bad about them.

88
00:05:22,926 --> 00:05:24,218
He's a great dresser.

89
00:05:24,302 --> 00:05:27,596
He never looks embarrassing,
which is hard for a man.

90
00:05:28,431 --> 00:05:30,182
Goddamn it, Charlie, get it together!

91
00:05:30,267 --> 00:05:31,643
He's very competitive.

92
00:05:31,726 --> 00:05:32,977
Come on!

93
00:05:33,478 --> 00:05:36,272
- What's this? Who owns Baltic Avenue?
- Me.

94
00:05:36,356 --> 00:05:37,357
How much is it?

95
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,358
-I don't have enough.
—$450.

96
00:05:39,442 --> 00:05:41,694
Okay, so I'm done?
I'm done, right? That's it?

97
00:05:42,529 --> 00:05:44,322
This is so frustrating!

98
00:05:45,115 --> 00:05:47,534
This is so frustrating. I always lose.

99
00:05:48,577 --> 00:05:49,995
- Dad.
- He loves being a dad.

100
00:05:50,078 --> 00:05:53,247
He loves all the things you're supposed
to hate, like the tantrums,

101
00:05:53,331 --> 00:05:54,582
the waking up at night.

102
00:05:56,376 --> 00:05:57,585
I had a bad dream.

103
00:05:59,629 --> 00:06:00,546
It's okay.

104
00:06:04,426 --> 00:06:06,636
It's almost annoying
how much he likes it,

105
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,930
but... then, it's mostly nice.

106
00:06:09,014 --> 00:06:10,473
Dad, stay.

107
00:06:39,586 --> 00:06:41,713
He disappears into his own world.

108
00:06:42,923 --> 00:06:44,090
Shit.

109
00:06:44,174 --> 00:06:45,884
- What's "shit?"
- This is our stop.

110
00:06:46,092 --> 00:06:48,385
He and Henry are alike in that way.

111
00:06:50,513 --> 00:06:53,641
He can tell people when they have food
in their teeth or on their face

112
00:06:53,725 --> 00:06:55,810
in a way that doesn't make them feel bad.

113
00:06:56,394 --> 00:06:57,812
Did you get it? Perfect.

114
00:06:57,896 --> 00:06:59,856
Charlie is self-made.

115
00:07:00,231 --> 00:07:01,273
His parents...

116
00:07:01,816 --> 00:07:03,442
I only met them once, but...

117
00:07:04,152 --> 00:07:07,905
he told me there was a lot of alcohol
and some violence in his childhood.

118
00:07:09,407 --> 00:07:11,992
As soon as she comes with a lookout,
they're coming with a camcorder.

119
00:07:12,077 --> 00:07:13,495
-Camcorder.
-Is that what they're called?

120
00:07:13,578 --> 00:07:16,622
He moved to New York from Indiana
with no safety net,

121
00:07:16,706 --> 00:07:18,999
and now he's more New Yorker
than any New Yorker.

122
00:07:19,084 --> 00:07:20,960
I made sure they used
the right almond milk.

123
00:07:21,044 --> 00:07:21,878
Genius.

124
00:07:21,962 --> 00:07:25,340
He is brilliant at creating family
out of whoever is around.

125
00:07:27,717 --> 00:07:31,429
With the theater company, he cast a spell
that made everyone feel included.

126
00:07:32,055 --> 00:07:34,057
No one, not even an intern,
was unimportant.

127
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:36,475
He could remember all the inside jokes.

128
00:07:36,559 --> 00:07:39,103
And where do you go when it's windy?

129
00:07:39,562 --> 00:07:41,355
Yeah, that — that was funny.

130
00:07:45,318 --> 00:07:48,404
He is extremely organized and thorough.

131
00:07:49,197 --> 00:07:51,407
He's very clear about what he wants,

132
00:07:51,491 --> 00:07:53,701
unlike me, who can't always tell.

133
00:07:54,452 --> 00:07:55,619
Let's stop right there.

134
00:08:16,307 --> 00:08:17,391
Who wants to start?

135
00:08:25,025 --> 00:08:26,693
I-I'm not going to read this out loud.

136
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:30,780
Why is that?

137
00:08:30,864 --> 00:08:32,490
Because I don't like what I wrote.

138
00:08:34,075 --> 00:08:37,369
As we mediate your separation

139
00:08:37,454 --> 00:08:39,622
and eventual divorce,

140
00:08:40,415 --> 00:08:43,209
things can get quite contentious.

141
00:08:43,293 --> 00:08:46,713
So, I like to begin
with a note of positivity,

142
00:08:47,255 --> 00:08:51,342
for the people I work with to remember
why they got married in the first place.

143
00:08:51,718 --> 00:08:54,387
And so that, as you come apart,

144
00:08:54,471 --> 00:08:56,097
you're reminded that...

145
00:08:56,931 --> 00:08:59,808
this is a person
you had great feeling for,

146
00:09:00,518 --> 00:09:02,978
and maybe still do in many ways.

147
00:09:06,274 --> 00:09:08,442
I'll read mine. I like what I wrote.

148
00:09:09,944 --> 00:09:11,236
For it to really work,

149
00:09:11,863 --> 00:09:13,239
you both have to read.

150
00:09:13,323 --> 00:09:14,407
I'm not going to.

151
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:16,534
Okay, um...

152
00:09:17,202 --> 00:09:20,872
I just think it's a shame
that you guys aren't going to get to hear,

153
00:09:21,372 --> 00:09:23,540
the wonderful things
you wrote about each other.

154
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:26,794
She always says I can't write,
but I think mine's pretty good.

155
00:09:26,878 --> 00:09:29,255
Nicole, maybe you'd change your mind
once you heard Charlie's.

156
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:30,757
I don't want to hear Charlie's.

157
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,091
We promised to listen.

158
00:09:32,175 --> 00:09:33,759
That's right.

159
00:09:34,135 --> 00:09:36,554
That's the very first step
in this process.

160
00:09:37,931 --> 00:09:41,392
Well, I think I'm going to go
if you two are going to just sit around

161
00:09:41,476 --> 00:09:43,519
and suck each other's dicks.

162
00:09:49,234 --> 00:09:51,945
How can this evil allow moderation ?

163
00:09:52,028 --> 00:09:54,113
How can this evil allow moderation?

164
00:09:55,115 --> 00:09:56,991
How can it be right
to betray the departed?

165
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:00,286
How is it human to be so...

166
00:10:01,538 --> 00:10:02,580
faithless?

167
00:10:04,332 --> 00:10:06,500
I want no praise from impious men.

168
00:10:07,502 --> 00:10:09,879
No home with them of quiet ease.

169
00:10:10,255 --> 00:10:13,007
Noble blood still runs in my veins.

170
00:10:14,467 --> 00:10:16,051
Shall I fail my father...

171
00:10:16,761 --> 00:10:18,053
stifling my cries,

172
00:10:18,555 --> 00:10:20,265
clipping the wings of grief?

173
00:10:21,015 --> 00:10:24,977
Must his corpse in the ground
wretchedly waste away,

174
00:10:25,061 --> 00:10:26,395
feebly count for nothing?

175
00:10:26,479 --> 00:10:28,147
Must his killers gloat...

176
00:10:28,523 --> 00:10:30,358
Must his killers gloat,

177
00:10:30,441 --> 00:10:33,402
never to pay with blood, for blood...

178
00:10:33,486 --> 00:10:36,447
Charlie gave me the note,
but it's really for you.

179
00:10:36,531 --> 00:10:38,991
-He told me to pick up my cues.
-How is that for me?

180
00:10:39,075 --> 00:10:40,785
Acting is reacting.

181
00:10:40,869 --> 00:10:43,204
I'm responding to you.
You're slowing me down.

182
00:10:43,288 --> 00:10:45,290
Frank, it's closing night, you know.

183
00:10:45,874 --> 00:10:48,626
You don't think Charlie and Nicole
will ever get back together?

184
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:51,713
No, I think this time it's really over.

185
00:10:51,796 --> 00:10:55,674
-It still feels weird.
-I feel like my parents are splitting up.

186
00:10:55,758 --> 00:10:57,551
It's always been "Charlie and Nicole."

187
00:10:57,635 --> 00:10:58,844
-Is Charlie still giving notes?
-Yep.

188
00:10:58,928 --> 00:11:00,596
You're lucky, Nic.
I wish I was going to LA.

189
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,890
You can actually have space in LA.
There's no space here.

190
00:11:05,435 --> 00:11:06,644
Ladies and gentlemen,

191
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,646
I want to make a toast

192
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:10,398
to Charlie...

193
00:11:11,149 --> 00:11:13,276
and to our beloved Nicole,

194
00:11:13,359 --> 00:11:17,859
who is going to be going out
on a new adventure,

195
00:11:18,489 --> 00:11:21,366
all the way to sunny California.

196
00:11:21,451 --> 00:11:24,829
And we are also going to try
something new.

197
00:11:24,913 --> 00:11:27,874
We are going to take our play to Broadway.

198
00:11:30,877 --> 00:11:33,421
It reminds me of when I was a young person

199
00:11:33,504 --> 00:11:35,797
and went to Broadway for the first time.

200
00:11:35,882 --> 00:11:37,466
And I'm telling you,

201
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:41,011
winning your first Tony at 27,

202
00:11:41,095 --> 00:11:43,222
it can mess with your head.

203
00:11:43,306 --> 00:11:46,851
I mean, I was just a baby.
Elia Kazan was backstage...

204
00:11:46,935 --> 00:11:48,561
I'm going to go over there now.

205
00:11:48,645 --> 00:11:51,147
- Don't do it. Mary Ann?
- ...elbowing Mike Nichols.

206
00:11:51,231 --> 00:11:53,775
And Mike was chatting with Dietrich,

207
00:11:53,858 --> 00:11:58,028
and Marlene, you know,
she usually was a barrel of monkeys,

208
00:11:58,112 --> 00:12:01,782
but tonight she was very, very serious.

209
00:12:02,784 --> 00:12:03,993
Could you give me a second?

210
00:12:25,515 --> 00:12:27,266
Well, I'd have to study it, but...

211
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:28,392
Hey.

212
00:12:28,476 --> 00:12:31,729
Hey, I didn't expect you guys home
until late.

213
00:12:32,188 --> 00:12:34,523
-How's he doing?
-Good, good. He went to bed on time.

214
00:12:34,607 --> 00:12:35,441
No fuss.

215
00:12:35,525 --> 00:12:37,527
Read him some of Cricket in Times Square.

216
00:12:38,861 --> 00:12:40,571
God, you guys are so attractive.

217
00:12:42,031 --> 00:12:44,742
Shit. Sorry, I didn't stop that
from being said.

218
00:12:45,785 --> 00:12:46,994
No, it's okay.

219
00:12:47,078 --> 00:12:49,747
I'll pay for the whole time.
We decided to come home early.

220
00:12:49,831 --> 00:12:52,708
Hey, thanks.
And also the travel time.

221
00:13:06,806 --> 00:13:09,517
...conversation
as well as anybody, but I've gotta run.

222
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,144
. . .if you know what I mean.

223
00:13:12,228 --> 00:13:15,856
- Y- You're leaving?
- Well, I ain't moving in.

224
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:18,108
We 'We'll be back when you get your-

225
00:13:24,324 --> 00:13:26,784
If you don't like that mediator,
we'll find another one.

226
00:13:26,868 --> 00:13:28,911
- Yeah.
- W-We might not need a mediator.

227
00:13:28,995 --> 00:13:30,955
We'll just split everything anyway,
I don't care.

228
00:13:31,414 --> 00:13:33,582
- Me neither.
- You can have most of it.

229
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:36,085
We'll get apartments near each other,
make it easier for Henry.

230
00:13:36,169 --> 00:13:37,044
We'll figure it out.

231
00:13:37,128 --> 00:13:38,921
-We want the same things.
-Right.

232
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:41,340
In the meantime,
the pilot will be fun for you.

233
00:13:44,177 --> 00:13:45,970
You don't think it's bad, do you?

234
00:13:46,054 --> 00:13:49,182
I don't ever watch TV,
so, you know, I can't tell.

235
00:13:58,316 --> 00:14:01,027
I told Henry I'd come out to LA
in two weeks to see him.

236
00:14:04,489 --> 00:14:05,448
Yes?

237
00:14:06,657 --> 00:14:07,658
Nothing.

238
00:14:09,702 --> 00:14:11,578
I can tell you want to give me a note.

239
00:14:11,662 --> 00:14:12,663
No, I don't.

240
00:14:14,582 --> 00:14:18,586
Yeah... I mean, yes, I do, but I guess...

241
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:23,174
I guess it doesn't matter now.
You won't be with the show anymore.

242
00:14:23,257 --> 00:14:24,258
It's stupid.

243
00:14:25,259 --> 00:14:27,970
You're not going to be able to sleep
until you tell me.

244
00:14:29,013 --> 00:14:30,014
Maybe not.

245
00:14:31,182 --> 00:14:32,349
Okay, then.

246
00:14:32,433 --> 00:14:34,184
So, there are two things.

247
00:14:35,353 --> 00:14:38,731
I thought your posture at the top
of scene seven is still too dignified.

248
00:14:39,774 --> 00:14:41,650
-Okay.
-And then...

249
00:14:43,361 --> 00:14:45,905
at the end, I could tell
you were pushing for the emotion.

250
00:14:46,406 --> 00:14:47,907
Well, you know I can't cry on stage,

251
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:50,492
and I know you don't like it
when I fake it, but...

252
00:14:51,744 --> 00:14:53,954
I thought maybe tonight
it would come, but...

253
00:14:55,248 --> 00:14:56,249
it didn't.

254
00:14:56,874 --> 00:14:58,166
That's all I had.

255
00:15:00,753 --> 00:15:02,004
Thanks for indulging me.

256
00:15:07,176 --> 00:15:08,260
Good night, Charlie.

00:15:43,212 --> 00:15:44,755

258
00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:47,675

G-ma, summer is for relaxing.

265
00:16:01,189 --> 00:16:04,025
-J' This is the day... ♪
-What do you want to do today?

266
00:16:04,108 --> 00:16:06,443
Hang out and relax with you.

267
00:16:06,527 --> 00:16:08,237
- Me too.
- No relaxing.

268
00:16:08,821 --> 00:16:10,906
Nicole has a hair and makeup test today,

269
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:14,368
and Henry, we got you into Fairy Camp
with the cousins.

270
00:16:14,994 --> 00:16:16,412
I hate Fairy Camp.

271
00:16:16,496 --> 00:16:18,706
Cassie says everyone likes Fairy Camp,

272
00:16:18,789 --> 00:16:21,291
and I think this is true.

273
00:16:22,335 --> 00:16:23,461


274
00:16:25,213 --> 00:16:27,632
Henry, go make your mom some coffee
like I taught you.

275
00:16:27,715 --> 00:16:30,175
Mom, wait till you taste my coffee.

276
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,887
Oop-a-doodle.

277
00:16:38,935 --> 00:16:42,355
Do you always sleep together?
Even in New York?

278
00:16:42,438 --> 00:16:45,607
No, it's just for right now
while we go through this transition.

279
00:16:46,234 --> 00:16:47,360
Shit.

280
00:16:47,443 --> 00:16:50,404
Don't tell Charlie when he gets here.
He hates co-sleeping.

281
00:16:50,488 --> 00:16:52,990
Well, I have to say, I agree with Charlie.

282
00:16:53,074 --> 00:16:55,076
Surprise surprise.

283
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:58,579
- It's as if you have exploded...
- Jesus, it's early.

284
00:16:59,247 --> 00:17:00,456
...into this room.

285
00:17:01,415 --> 00:17:02,791
I can do this part alone.

286
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:04,459
Fine. I won't look.

287
00:17:06,087 --> 00:17:10,091
As long as you're in my house,
wake up is at 6:30 a.m.,

288
00:17:10,216 --> 00:17:13,844
and until you know what you want to do,
we're going to do what I like to do.

289
00:17:13,928 --> 00:17:17,598
I can't just go from what Charlie
wanted to do to what you want to do.

290
00:17:17,682 --> 00:17:20,518
Even though I am 64

291
00:17:20,601 --> 00:17:22,394
and have a dead gay husband,

292
00:17:22,478 --> 00:17:25,230
I manage to get up every day,

293
00:17:25,314 --> 00:17:28,025
live my life,
and feel pretty good about myself.

294
00:17:28,109 --> 00:17:30,194
So, maybe your mom knows a thing or two.

295
00:17:30,653 --> 00:17:31,987
You know what I would do?

296
00:17:32,572 --> 00:17:33,531
About what?

297
00:17:33,614 --> 00:17:37,075
When Charlie gets here,
I'd whisk him off to Palm Springs.

298
00:17:37,159 --> 00:17:40,328
That's what your father and I did
whenever we hit a speed bump.

299
00:17:40,705 --> 00:17:43,749
Didn't you walk in on Dad
blowing the porter in Palm Springs?

300
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:47,545
And I always regretted
getting so upset about it.

301
00:17:47,628 --> 00:17:51,632
Charlie and I are getting a divorce, Mom.
There's nothing for us in Palm Springs.

302
00:17:51,716 --> 00:17:54,468
You need to wash your face
before you go to sleep.

303
00:17:54,552 --> 00:17:55,636
When Daddy gets here,

304
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,222
- maybe we could all go on the Jaws ride.
- Yeah.

305
00:17:58,306 --> 00:18:00,808
Or I could go once with Daddy
and once with you,

306
00:18:00,891 --> 00:18:02,726
because I wouldn't mind
going twice anyway.

307
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:04,603
No, we'll all go together, sweetheart.

308
00:18:04,687 --> 00:18:08,023
Did you know that Universal Studios
is where I did my first screen test?

309
00:18:08,107 --> 00:18:11,026
On the plane, I re-read the pilot
as if I were Charlie reading it,

310
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:13,237
and I started to think it was just bad.

311
00:18:13,321 --> 00:18:15,906
My agent says it's one to watch.

312
00:18:17,325 --> 00:18:19,702
-This coffee is good. Thank you.
-You're welcome.

313
00:18:19,785 --> 00:18:21,995
What if Charlie is on Broadway

314
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:24,331
with a play I brought him,
which I originated,

315
00:18:24,415 --> 00:18:25,916
and I'm just doing bad TV?

316
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,045
Everyone is only impressed
when they see someone on TV.

317
00:18:30,504 --> 00:18:32,631
- She's beautiful.
- Her wig looks great.

318
00:18:32,715 --> 00:18:34,383
Where's she been
the past ten years?

319
00:18:34,467 --> 00:18:37,052
Doing weird theater in New York,
downtown shit.

320
00:18:37,136 --> 00:18:39,263
-I saw one. it rained onstage.
-Can I say something?

321
00:18:39,347 --> 00:18:40,806
It was good. Edgy.

322
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:43,559
Directed by her husband,
supposedly very controlling.

323
00:18:43,643 --> 00:18:46,312
- We're lucky to have her.
- I'm surprised she said yes.

324
00:18:46,395 --> 00:18:48,897
- We can thank her divorce.
- Can she move her hand?

325
00:18:48,981 --> 00:18:51,775
It's going to be hard to roto in the hair
on the baby around her fingers.

326
00:18:51,859 --> 00:18:54,570
Can... you move your hand
further down the baby?

327
00:18:58,616 --> 00:19:00,868
- Where? Like here?
- Off the head entirely.

328
00:19:01,577 --> 00:19:02,995
I have to support his head.

329
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:06,499
No, no, support the head, of course.
Just try and do it from the... shoulders?

330
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:09,376
- It's perfect.
- Yes, good.

331
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,544
I can't hold a baby like this.

332
00:19:10,628 --> 00:19:11,837
She's right, that's going to look weird.

333
00:19:11,921 --> 00:19:13,923
We can totally do it.
It'll just take time and money.

334
00:19:14,006 --> 00:19:16,967
it was very important to me
to have this show based on hard science.

335
00:19:17,051 --> 00:19:18,719
So we can see your pretty face
and not ours.

336
00:19:18,803 --> 00:19:22,181
You should've seen me
before the plants invaded.

337
00:19:22,264 --> 00:19:23,473
I say that with respect.

338
00:19:23,557 --> 00:19:25,016
I was raised by two mothers.

339
00:19:25,393 --> 00:19:28,437
Can you lower the board please, Pablo?

340
00:19:29,855 --> 00:19:31,648
Here? How about here?

341
00:19:32,775 --> 00:19:34,777
-How about now?
-Why is there always a flirty grip?

342
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:37,153
I can do anything you want.
I just need her here two hours —

343
00:19:37,238 --> 00:19:38,280
Can I say something?

344
00:19:38,364 --> 00:19:40,199
Dennis, hold on. What, honey?

345
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,535
She has to know
how to hold a baby.

346
00:19:42,618 --> 00:19:44,995
- Later on, after she kills Donny...
- She kills Donny?

347
00:19:45,079 --> 00:19:47,122
That's a secret.
We didn't give the crew those pages.

348
00:19:47,206 --> 00:19:49,625
...she becomes a sort of a Earth mother
to the plant community.

349
00:19:49,709 --> 00:19:51,252
That's not going to make any sense

350
00:19:51,335 --> 00:19:53,295
if we feel like she's a bad mother
to her own kid.

351
00:19:53,379 --> 00:19:54,797
-She's right.
-Does Donny know?

352
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,299
-Must be nice to get out of New York.
-Well, I'm from out here.

353
00:19:57,383 --> 00:19:59,843
Our daughter, Mia, is at NYU,
living in a shoebox.

354
00:19:59,927 --> 00:20:02,012
She says it went up to 104 the other day.

355
00:20:02,096 --> 00:20:05,474
-We are just so excited to have you.
-I'm excited to be here.

356
00:20:05,558 --> 00:20:09,061
We're going for an early aughts aesthetic,
so having your presence just nails that.

357
00:20:09,145 --> 00:20:10,312
What signifies early aughts?

358
00:20:10,396 --> 00:20:12,064
Into The Girl was on TV...

359
00:20:12,148 --> 00:20:14,066
-All Over The Girl.
-...or streaming or something.

360
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:16,026
You are fucking hot in that movie.

361
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:17,861
-Carol.
-Fuck it, I speak my mind.

362
00:20:17,945 --> 00:20:20,489
-We're not allowing our son to see it.
-Because you show your tits.

363
00:20:20,573 --> 00:20:21,448
-Carol!
-Yeah.

364
00:20:21,532 --> 00:20:23,158
-Dennis.
-This is Carter Mitchum.

365
00:20:23,242 --> 00:20:25,702
He's a futurist at UCLA.

366
00:20:25,786 --> 00:20:29,247
He's consulting on all the environmental
stuff for the show so it's accurate.

367
00:20:29,331 --> 00:20:30,915
-Nice to meet you.
-Is it?

368
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,875
-What?
-Accurate?

369
00:20:31,959 --> 00:20:32,960
So far, none of it.

370
00:20:33,544 --> 00:20:36,171
This pilot will go.
So get ready to move back to LA.

371
00:20:36,255 --> 00:20:39,049
Listen, everything you were saying
back there was absolutely right.

372
00:20:39,133 --> 00:20:42,177
-If she's a bad mom, we lose the audience.
-Nobody knows we're killing Donny,

373
00:20:42,261 --> 00:20:43,929
-including Donny.
-I... I thought —

374
00:20:44,013 --> 00:20:46,890
Let us know if you'd like to be part
of our writers' room.

375
00:20:46,974 --> 00:20:49,101
I bet you'd be really helpful, actually.

376
00:20:49,185 --> 00:20:50,561
Or I could direct.

377
00:20:50,686 --> 00:20:53,063
-No, yeah.
-Sorry, what? Maybe that sounds crazy.

378
00:20:53,147 --> 00:20:54,314
No, do you have a reel?

379
00:20:54,857 --> 00:20:58,861
No, because I've — I've never done it.
I watched my husband do it for years.

380
00:20:59,195 --> 00:21:00,696
Almost ex-husband.

381
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:03,824
What's the opposite of fiancé?

382
00:21:03,908 --> 00:21:05,701
Dennis and I will talk
to your agent about it.

383
00:21:05,785 --> 00:21:09,121
At our theater I always wanted to direct,
and then Charlie would say something like,

384
00:21:09,205 --> 00:21:10,998
"The next one,"
but he was always the director,

385
00:21:11,081 --> 00:21:12,582
so there never was a next one.

386
00:21:13,459 --> 00:21:16,628
I don't know. Maybe if we'd
stayed married, there would've been.

387
00:21:16,712 --> 00:21:19,423
Yeah, no. We're going
to kill him off. it seems unlikely...

388
00:21:22,092 --> 00:21:23,593
I'm going to give you a number.

389
00:21:23,677 --> 00:21:26,429
Okay, is it a therapist?
Because I have a therapist.

390
00:21:26,722 --> 00:21:29,349
Well, it's my mom's therapist.
We share her.

391
00:21:29,433 --> 00:21:32,144
She's a lawyer. She represented me
when I left Dennis.

392
00:21:33,938 --> 00:21:35,356
You and Dennis are divorced?

393
00:21:35,439 --> 00:21:36,565
Since 2013.

394
00:21:36,649 --> 00:21:37,900
You still work together.

395
00:21:38,275 --> 00:21:39,234
That's nice.

396
00:21:39,318 --> 00:21:40,736
No, he's a fucking cocksucker.

397
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:43,280
Nora got me half of this project
in the settlement.

398
00:21:44,532 --> 00:21:47,076
Well, we talked about doing it
without lawyers.

399
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:49,077
My sister had me meet
a bunch of them already,

400
00:21:49,161 --> 00:21:51,663
and I... just... hated them.

401
00:21:52,289 --> 00:21:53,290
Call Nora.

402
00:21:53,999 --> 00:21:55,291
She saved my life.

403
00:21:56,794 --> 00:21:57,920
Sorry, I...

404
00:21:58,003 --> 00:21:59,004
look so schleppy.

405
00:21:59,088 --> 00:22:01,006
I had an event at my kid's school.

406
00:22:02,132 --> 00:22:03,508
Let me get this out of the way.

407
00:22:03,592 --> 00:22:05,927
I think you're a wonderful actress.

408
00:22:06,637 --> 00:22:07,471
Thank you.

409
00:22:07,555 --> 00:22:09,181
Moved All Over The Girl,

410
00:22:09,265 --> 00:22:11,809
but the theater stuff too...

411
00:22:11,892 --> 00:22:13,268
You saw the theater stuff?

412
00:22:13,352 --> 00:22:15,645
I was in New York last year for my book,

413
00:22:15,729 --> 00:22:17,439
which, remind me to give you a copy,

414
00:22:17,857 --> 00:22:19,275
and my publisher took me.

415
00:22:19,358 --> 00:22:20,359
Great.

416
00:22:21,235 --> 00:22:22,778
-Thank you.
-You are awesome.

417
00:22:25,114 --> 00:22:27,449
- Well, Charlie directed it.
- I know.

418
00:22:27,992 --> 00:22:29,034
He's very talented.

419
00:22:29,201 --> 00:22:30,410
He is.

420
00:22:30,494 --> 00:22:32,204
They're moving it to Broadway.

421
00:22:33,497 --> 00:22:35,081
Well, without me, of course.

422
00:22:35,583 --> 00:22:36,917
He was lucky to have you.

423
00:22:39,587 --> 00:22:41,046
How are you doing?

424
00:22:48,637 --> 00:22:50,263
Sorry.

425
00:22:51,807 --> 00:22:53,725
Honey...

426
00:23:02,276 --> 00:23:03,652
You take some breaths.

427
00:23:04,945 --> 00:23:07,906
And while you do,
I'm going to tell you about myself.

428
00:23:08,908 --> 00:23:10,451
If you should choose to hire me,

429
00:23:10,534 --> 00:23:13,078
I will work tirelessly for you,

430
00:23:13,162 --> 00:23:15,831
and I'm always available by phone or text,

431
00:23:15,915 --> 00:23:17,458
except when I'm with my kids.

432
00:23:17,541 --> 00:23:20,293
I insist on doing drop off and pick up
every day at school.

433
00:23:20,377 --> 00:23:22,504
- I understand.
- I've been through this myself.

434
00:23:23,547 --> 00:23:25,465
Thank you, Annie. So...

435
00:23:26,175 --> 00:23:27,718
I know how it feels.

436
00:23:27,801 --> 00:23:29,636
-You do?
-Yes.

437
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:33,390
I have a kid from my ex,
who is a narcissistic artist...

438
00:23:34,391 --> 00:23:35,725
and verbally abusive.

439
00:23:36,226 --> 00:23:38,770
I'm now with a great boyfriend
who lives in Malibu.

440
00:23:38,854 --> 00:23:40,355
Good.

441
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:43,066
Well, Charlie's not terrible.

442
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:44,776
No, of course not.

443
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:48,113
But they ravish you with attention
in the beginning...

444
00:23:48,197 --> 00:23:50,991
And then once we have babies,
we become the mom

445
00:23:51,075 --> 00:23:53,035
and... they get sick of us.

446
00:23:53,118 --> 00:23:54,035
Yeah.

447
00:23:56,538 --> 00:23:58,206
Where do you want to live now, doll?

448
00:23:58,832 --> 00:23:59,833
Well...

449
00:24:01,418 --> 00:24:03,753
I'm here now, obviously.

450
00:24:03,837 --> 00:24:06,381
I don't know
if the show will get picked up, but...

451
00:24:07,758 --> 00:24:08,925
it feels like home.

452
00:24:10,177 --> 00:24:11,178
It is home.

453
00:24:11,971 --> 00:24:14,223
It's the only home I've ever known
without Charlie.

454
00:24:15,015 --> 00:24:16,182
You want to stay here?

455
00:24:17,142 --> 00:24:19,102
Charlie's not going to want that. He...

456
00:24:20,145 --> 00:24:21,146
He hates LA.

457
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:23,357
We're interested in what you want to do.

458
00:24:24,441 --> 00:24:27,193
Sounds to me
like you did your time in New York.

459
00:24:28,153 --> 00:24:30,321
He can do some time here, no?

460
00:24:30,406 --> 00:24:32,366
He always said we would, but he never...

461
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,075
did.

462
00:24:34,702 --> 00:24:35,953
How old is your son?

463
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:37,204
Henry's eight.

464
00:24:37,287 --> 00:24:38,913
Yeah.

465
00:24:38,998 --> 00:24:40,124
He likes LA.

466
00:24:42,835 --> 00:24:44,545
I don't know if it's fair to him.

467
00:24:45,963 --> 00:24:47,798
I want you to listen to me.

468
00:24:49,675 --> 00:24:52,177
What you're doing is an act of hope.

469
00:24:53,262 --> 00:24:54,763
Do you understand that?

470
00:24:55,889 --> 00:24:56,890
Yeah.

471
00:24:57,349 --> 00:25:01,019
You're saying,
"I want something better for myself."

472
00:25:01,854 --> 00:25:02,688
I do.

473
00:25:03,272 --> 00:25:06,066
And this, right now, is the worst time.

474
00:25:07,026 --> 00:25:08,444
It will only get better.

475
00:25:10,696 --> 00:25:13,907
Wasn't it Tom Petty who said,
"The waiting is the hardest part"?

476
00:25:15,284 --> 00:25:16,368
I don't know.

477
00:25:16,869 --> 00:25:19,705
I represented his wife in their divorce.

478
00:25:19,788 --> 00:25:21,206
I got her half of that song.

479
00:25:21,832 --> 00:25:23,959
I don't want any money or anything.

480
00:25:25,085 --> 00:25:28,004
I just worry because we weren't
going to use lawyers, so...

481
00:25:28,839 --> 00:25:30,590
I don't want to be too aggressive.

482
00:25:31,967 --> 00:25:33,551
I want to stay friends.

483
00:25:35,012 --> 00:25:37,180
We'll do it as gently as possible.

484
00:25:38,515 --> 00:25:39,849
Now...

485
00:25:42,311 --> 00:25:45,022
Can you tell me a little more
about what's going on?

486
00:25:45,814 --> 00:25:49,317
Because part of what we're going to do
together is tell your story.

487
00:25:51,195 --> 00:25:53,197
It's difficult to articulate.

488
00:25:53,614 --> 00:25:54,615
It's...

489
00:25:54,698 --> 00:25:57,117
not as simple
as not being in love anymore.

490
00:25:57,201 --> 00:25:58,785
I understand.

491
00:25:59,995 --> 00:26:02,998
Why don't you start at the beginning?
Wherever that is for you.

492
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:06,376
Well...

493
00:26:07,836 --> 00:26:09,462
I was engaged to Ben

494
00:26:09,546 --> 00:26:11,297
and living in LA, you know?

495
00:26:12,424 --> 00:26:16,344
And I felt like yes,
I want to make movies and marry Ben.

496
00:26:16,804 --> 00:26:19,264
Jesus,
I was only 19 or 20 at the time.

497
00:26:19,348 --> 00:26:21,641
I never felt older in my whole life.

498
00:26:21,725 --> 00:26:23,852
Anyway, if I was honest with myself,

499
00:26:23,936 --> 00:26:25,979
it was like a small part of me
felt dead...

500
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:27,064
or dead-ish.

501
00:26:27,898 --> 00:26:29,232
You know, you tell yourself,

502
00:26:29,316 --> 00:26:31,318
"No one's perfect,
no relationship's perfect."

503
00:26:33,779 --> 00:26:35,655
This tea is delicious.

504
00:26:35,739 --> 00:26:38,074
Isn't it? It's the Manuka honey.

505
00:26:39,493 --> 00:26:41,828
Anyway, you were asking about Charlie.

506
00:26:42,496 --> 00:26:43,997
So, um...

507
00:26:44,081 --> 00:26:46,124
So, yes. So, I was... I was...

508
00:26:46,667 --> 00:26:49,294
happy with Ben and aware of the deadness,

509
00:26:49,378 --> 00:26:50,962
and I went to New York

510
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:54,341
to meet with this director
for this space movie.

511
00:26:54,424 --> 00:26:57,135
But one where they take space seriously,
like...

512
00:26:57,219 --> 00:26:59,221
Sex trafficking in space.

513
00:26:59,304 --> 00:27:00,638
You know, it was political.

514
00:27:00,722 --> 00:27:02,640
Or at least they wanted us
to think it was.

515
00:27:02,724 --> 00:27:03,975
Anyway, it just...

516
00:27:04,768 --> 00:27:08,480
it was really fulfilling the same need
that certain fucked up porn does.

517
00:27:08,564 --> 00:27:10,232
Um, but anyway, so...

518
00:27:10,566 --> 00:27:11,692
while I was there...

519
00:27:12,609 --> 00:27:14,277
the producer...

520
00:27:14,361 --> 00:27:15,653
Invited me to see a play.

521
00:27:17,447 --> 00:27:20,533
It took place in someone's apartment
with all the lights on.

522
00:27:21,118 --> 00:27:23,036
It was like nothing I'd ever seen before.

523
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,163
This strange...

524
00:27:25,747 --> 00:27:28,207
surreal, dystopian story,

525
00:27:28,625 --> 00:27:30,376
and it was so well-acted.

526
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:34,338
And one of the actors
was this big shaggy bear

527
00:27:34,423 --> 00:27:37,426
who played all his lines
looking directly at me,

528
00:27:37,509 --> 00:27:40,637
which I knew couldn't be the case,
but it felt like it.

529
00:27:41,138 --> 00:27:43,306
And then later, of course,
I learned that it was.

530
00:27:46,393 --> 00:27:49,187
-These cookies are really great too.
-I'll send you home with some.

531
00:27:49,271 --> 00:27:51,523
Afterwards, I was introduced to the cast,

532
00:27:51,607 --> 00:27:55,152
and the bear turned out
to also be the director.

533
00:27:55,777 --> 00:27:57,528
He talked to me and...

534
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,281


535
00:28:00,157 --> 00:28:01,491
I talked back.

536
00:28:03,535 --> 00:28:05,954
The dead part wasn't dead,
it was just in a coma.

537
00:28:06,455 --> 00:28:07,289
And...

538
00:28:08,415 --> 00:28:10,792
it was better than the sex, the talking.

539
00:28:10,876 --> 00:28:11,751
Although the...

540
00:28:12,544 --> 00:28:14,337
the sex was also like the talking.

541
00:28:14,421 --> 00:28:16,756
You know, everything is like everything
in a relationship.

542
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,341
Don't you find that?

543
00:28:18,759 --> 00:28:19,760
And, um...

544
00:28:20,219 --> 00:28:21,220
So, we spent...

545
00:28:22,512 --> 00:28:24,889
the whole night
and the next day together and...

546
00:28:26,516 --> 00:28:27,934
I just never left.

547
00:28:28,018 --> 00:28:31,896
Yes, to be honest, all the problems
were there in the beginning too.

548
00:28:32,272 --> 00:28:34,274
But... I just went along with him
and his life

549
00:28:34,358 --> 00:28:37,194
because it felt so damn good
to feel myself alive.

550
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:41,781
In the beginning,
I was the actress, the star, and...

551
00:28:42,616 --> 00:28:46,328
That felt like something, you know.
People came to see me at first, but...

552
00:28:47,329 --> 00:28:49,456
the farther away I got from that and...

553
00:28:50,332 --> 00:28:53,293
the more acclaim the theater company got,
I had less and less weight.

554
00:28:53,377 --> 00:28:54,711
I just became...

555
00:28:55,462 --> 00:28:56,296
"who?"

556
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:59,633
"Well, you know, the actress
that was in that thing that time."

557
00:28:59,716 --> 00:29:00,758
And he was the draw.

558
00:29:01,343 --> 00:29:03,303
And... that...

559
00:29:04,554 --> 00:29:05,888
would've been fine, but...

560
00:29:07,766 --> 00:29:08,975
I got smaller.

561
00:29:15,816 --> 00:29:16,858
I realized I...

562
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:20,320
I didn't ever really
come alive for myself.

563
00:29:20,404 --> 00:29:22,155
I was just feeding his aliveness.

564
00:29:23,407 --> 00:29:24,241
And...

565
00:29:25,617 --> 00:29:26,868
you know...

566
00:29:26,952 --> 00:29:29,120
He was so smart and creative, it...

567
00:29:29,788 --> 00:29:30,789
it was fine.

568
00:29:31,581 --> 00:29:34,750
You know, I would tell him things
at home in private,

569
00:29:34,835 --> 00:29:38,421
and they would work their way into public
conversation, into his work, and...

570
00:29:38,964 --> 00:29:41,925
For a while, that felt like enough.
I mean, I was just so...

571
00:29:42,092 --> 00:29:42,926
SO...

572
00:29:43,343 --> 00:29:45,428
so flattered
that someone like him would...

573
00:29:45,512 --> 00:29:47,680
would find an idea I had worth trying

574
00:29:47,764 --> 00:29:50,224
or a comment I made worth repeating and...

575
00:29:50,851 --> 00:29:52,561
and then, I got pregnant.

576
00:29:52,644 --> 00:29:56,147
And I thought that having a baby
could be ours, could really be ours,

577
00:29:56,231 --> 00:29:57,649
but also really mine.

578
00:29:58,025 --> 00:30:01,069
And... you know, he was so excited.

579
00:30:01,153 --> 00:30:02,612
So, it was nice.

580
00:30:03,196 --> 00:30:04,197
For a while.

581
00:30:04,865 --> 00:30:06,199
I mean, kids, they...

582
00:30:06,867 --> 00:30:08,869
they belong to themselves. It's like...

583
00:30:09,036 --> 00:30:11,621
the instant they leave your body,
it's just...

584
00:30:11,955 --> 00:30:14,791
the process of them going away...

585
00:30:15,834 --> 00:30:17,669
And I didn't belong to myself.

586
00:30:17,753 --> 00:30:20,964
And it was small stuff, stupid stuff,
and big stuff.

587
00:30:21,214 --> 00:30:23,424
All the furniture in our house

588
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,801
was his taste.

589
00:30:24,885 --> 00:30:26,970
I didn't even know
what my taste was anymore

590
00:30:27,054 --> 00:30:29,306
because I had never been asked to use it.

591
00:30:29,806 --> 00:30:32,558
I didn't even pick our apartment.
I just moved into his.

592
00:30:32,642 --> 00:30:35,561
And I made noises
about wanting to move back to LA, but...

593
00:30:35,645 --> 00:30:36,896
they came to nothing.

594
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:39,524
And we'd come here on holidays
because he liked my family.

595
00:30:39,608 --> 00:30:42,193
But if I suggested
we do a year or something,

596
00:30:43,028 --> 00:30:44,154
he'd just put me off.

597
00:30:44,488 --> 00:30:45,739
It would be...

598
00:30:46,656 --> 00:30:49,492
strange if he turned to me and said,

599
00:30:50,243 --> 00:30:51,911
"And what do you want to do today?"

600
00:30:52,913 --> 00:30:56,249
You know, I just watched that documentary
on George Harrison,

601
00:30:56,583 --> 00:30:58,042
and I thought, "Own it.

602
00:30:58,502 --> 00:30:59,836
Just own it.

603
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,421
Be like George Harrison's wife.

604
00:31:01,505 --> 00:31:03,632
Being a wife and a mother, that's enough."

605
00:31:04,049 --> 00:31:07,093
Yeah, then I realized
I couldn't remember her name, so...

606
00:31:08,929 --> 00:31:10,889
This pilot came along.

607
00:31:11,473 --> 00:31:14,767
It shot in LA and it paid so much...

608
00:31:14,851 --> 00:31:17,979
And it was like there was
this little lifeline thrown to me.

609
00:31:18,063 --> 00:31:21,066
Here's this bit of earth that's yours,
and...

610
00:31:22,192 --> 00:31:25,528
I was embarrassed about it
in front of him, but it was also like...

611
00:31:26,321 --> 00:31:30,283
yeah, this is who I am,
and this is what I'm worth.

612
00:31:30,367 --> 00:31:33,495
And maybe it's stupid,
but at least it's mine.

613
00:31:34,579 --> 00:31:38,583
And if he had just taken me
into a big hug and said,

614
00:31:38,917 --> 00:31:41,294
"Baby, I'm so excited for your adventure.

615
00:31:41,378 --> 00:31:44,339
Of course I want you to have
a piece of earth that's yours."

616
00:31:44,798 --> 00:31:45,632
Then...

617
00:31:45,966 --> 00:31:48,176
Well, then,
we might not be getting divorced.

618
00:31:48,427 --> 00:31:49,261
But...

619
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:52,222
he made fun of it and...

620
00:31:52,722 --> 00:31:54,974
was jealous like he is, and...

621
00:31:55,934 --> 00:31:58,019
then he realized about the money.

622
00:31:58,562 --> 00:32:01,690
And he told me I could funnel it
back into the theater company.

623
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:05,402
And that's when I realized...

624
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:07,404
he...

625
00:32:08,864 --> 00:32:10,073
truly didn't see me.

626
00:32:11,408 --> 00:32:14,035
He didn't see me as something
separate from himself.

627
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,330
And I asked him to say my phone number.

628
00:32:17,622 --> 00:32:18,497
Laughs]

629
00:32:18,582 --> 00:32:19,624
He didn't know it.

630
00:32:20,083 --> 00:32:21,125
So, I left.

631
00:32:27,799 --> 00:32:30,927
Also, I think he slept
with the stage manager, Mary Ann.

632
00:32:32,721 --> 00:32:34,389
That fucking asshole.

633
00:32:34,473 --> 00:32:35,640
Seventy-five...

634
00:32:35,974 --> 00:32:37,100
just 70,

635
00:32:37,184 --> 00:32:38,685
those two zeros,

636
00:32:38,768 --> 00:32:41,061
-seventy-five point zero zero...
-"if railroad is unowned...

637
00:32:41,146 --> 00:32:43,439
-that's zero cents.
-...you may buy it from the bank."

638
00:32:43,523 --> 00:32:46,192
"Advance to Illios...

639
00:32:46,276 --> 00:32:48,528
-Illinois.
-...Illinois Avenue."

640
00:32:49,154 --> 00:32:51,197
"Advance..." what does that mean?

641
00:32:51,281 --> 00:32:53,116
It means you've got to go
to Illinois Avenue.

642
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,577
So where is Illinois Avenue?

643
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:56,494
That one.

644
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:58,621
So Cassie, when Charlie gets here,

645
00:32:58,705 --> 00:33:00,289
you're going to hand him the envelope.

646
00:33:00,373 --> 00:33:02,124
Why do I have to do it?

647
00:33:02,209 --> 00:33:06,129
Because Nicole is very good
at getting people to do things for her.

648
00:33:06,213 --> 00:33:07,672
That's not what this is.

649
00:33:07,756 --> 00:33:09,883
I wiped her butt
until she was nine years old.

650
00:33:09,966 --> 00:33:11,175
She's very seductive that way.

651
00:33:11,259 --> 00:33:14,053
No, Mom, legally,
I can't be the one who serves him.

652
00:33:14,137 --> 00:33:16,347
But still, what I'm saying is true.

653
00:33:16,431 --> 00:33:19,308
Do I have to actually hand him
the envelope?

654
00:33:19,392 --> 00:33:22,061
Yes, but I'm going to tell him in advance
that they're divorce papers.

655
00:33:22,145 --> 00:33:25,273
Nora says it doesn't have to be so formal.
Where's Henry?

656
00:33:25,732 --> 00:33:28,443
He's playing in the living room
with Sam, and Jules, and Molly.

657
00:33:28,527 --> 00:33:30,654
Let's get them upstairs.
Charlie's going to be here soon.

658
00:33:30,737 --> 00:33:31,821
Sam, go upstairs.

659
00:33:31,905 --> 00:33:34,157
So, I'll tell Charlie
what's happening,

660
00:33:34,241 --> 00:33:37,118
and, Cassie,
you then hand him the envelope.

661
00:33:37,202 --> 00:33:38,036
Okay...

662
00:33:38,453 --> 00:33:39,495
I just get nervous.

663
00:33:39,579 --> 00:33:41,789
Well, can you un-serve?

664
00:33:42,541 --> 00:33:44,918
- What do you mean? Like take it back?
- Yeah.

665
00:33:46,002 --> 00:33:47,336
-I think so.
-You should check.

666
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:50,131
-In case we change our minds...
-I'm not going to change my mind.

667
00:33:50,215 --> 00:33:52,884
-...or we feel too bad for him.
-Maybe in case I do something wrong.

668
00:33:52,968 --> 00:33:54,886
Now you're both
just making me feel bad, okay?

669
00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:56,471
Sorry, sorry, I'm nervous!

670
00:33:56,555 --> 00:33:58,223
Well, we all are.

671
00:33:58,348 --> 00:34:00,099
And we love Charlie.

672
00:34:00,183 --> 00:34:02,226
You have to stop loving him, Mom.

673
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:03,978
You can't be friends with him anymore.

674
00:34:04,062 --> 00:34:06,481
Charlie and I have our own relationship...

675
00:34:06,565 --> 00:34:08,900
...independent of your marriage.

676
00:34:08,984 --> 00:34:10,485
Just like I'm still friends

677
00:34:10,569 --> 00:34:12,487
with Cassie's ex, Jeff.

678
00:34:12,571 --> 00:34:13,947
Are you still seeing Jeff?

679
00:34:14,447 --> 00:34:16,157
An occasional lunch.

680
00:34:16,241 --> 00:34:17,492
I can't believe you!

681
00:34:17,576 --> 00:34:19,411
He still wants his camera back,
by the way.

682
00:34:19,494 --> 00:34:22,622
Listen, nothing can be independent
of our marriage right now.

683
00:34:22,706 --> 00:34:25,709
I can't believe I even have to explain
this to you. Just be on my side, okay?

684
00:34:25,792 --> 00:34:27,210
- Okay.
- And...

685
00:34:27,794 --> 00:34:29,295
stop seeing Jeff!

686
00:34:30,755 --> 00:34:33,591
Cassie, you're the server.

687
00:34:33,675 --> 00:34:35,927
Just let me practice a few times.

688
00:34:36,011 --> 00:34:37,846
I was never a good auditioner.

689
00:34:37,929 --> 00:34:40,765
-That's because you wanted it too badly.
-It's not an audition.

690
00:34:40,849 --> 00:34:44,602
- I'll play Charlie.
- It's just my palms are so perspired.

691
00:34:44,686 --> 00:34:47,021
Sweetie, you're blotting the envelope.

692
00:34:47,105 --> 00:34:49,065
Maybe Nicole should play you.

693
00:34:49,149 --> 00:34:50,275
Did you really just say that?

694
00:34:50,358 --> 00:34:52,526
We don't need to practice.
This is not a performance.

695
00:34:52,611 --> 00:34:54,070
Did we finish the other wine already?

696
00:34:54,154 --> 00:34:55,238
Yeah.

697
00:34:56,448 --> 00:34:58,283
Okay, let me get him.

698
00:34:58,366 --> 00:34:59,700
-Okay.
-You both go in the other room.

699
00:34:59,784 --> 00:35:02,661
Cassie, you make sure that Henry
goes upstairs with Molly and Jules.

700
00:35:02,746 --> 00:35:03,747
Happening now.

701
00:35:05,665 --> 00:35:07,625
-Mom!
-I'm getting my wine.

702
00:35:08,501 --> 00:35:09,335
What?

703
00:35:09,419 --> 00:35:11,170
Henry's pooping
in the bathroom downstairs.

704
00:35:11,254 --> 00:35:12,797
Can we transfer him to the one upstairs?

705
00:35:12,881 --> 00:35:15,258
-I think it's mid-poop.
-Just grab him when he comes out.

706
00:35:15,342 --> 00:35:16,551
-Cassie?
-What?

707
00:35:16,635 --> 00:35:19,971
I'm... I'm putting the envelope
over here by the toaster.

708
00:35:20,055 --> 00:35:21,181
Copy you.

709
00:35:27,479 --> 00:35:28,480
Hi.

710
00:35:28,563 --> 00:35:30,648
- Where's Henry?
- He's pooping.

711
00:35:31,358 --> 00:35:32,650
Hi, Henry!

712
00:35:33,526 --> 00:35:35,027
Does this couch still open?

713
00:35:35,111 --> 00:35:35,945
Yeah.

714
00:35:36,321 --> 00:35:40,241
I got off the plane to a text, but don't
tell anyone yet. It's still a secret.

715
00:35:40,325 --> 00:35:41,409
Okay.

716
00:35:44,245 --> 00:35:46,163
I won a MacArthur grant.

717
00:35:46,581 --> 00:35:47,540
Charlie!

718
00:35:47,624 --> 00:35:49,208
My God, that's great!

719
00:35:49,292 --> 00:35:50,459
Congratulations.

720
00:35:50,543 --> 00:35:53,712
I'll say it because you can't.
It's the genius grant. You're a genius.

721
00:35:53,797 --> 00:35:55,715
I'm really happy for you.
You deserve it.

722
00:35:55,799 --> 00:35:58,384
It's yours too.
We did all of this together.

723
00:35:58,468 --> 00:36:00,011
Thank you, but...

724
00:36:00,095 --> 00:36:01,846
it's yours, Charlie, you enjoy it.

725
00:36:02,597 --> 00:36:03,723
I'm starving.

726
00:36:03,807 --> 00:36:05,934
It's good money,
and they parse it out over five years.

727
00:36:06,017 --> 00:36:08,561
But it means I can keep everyone
in the theater company employed,

728
00:36:08,645 --> 00:36:09,604
pay my credit card debt.

729
00:36:09,688 --> 00:36:10,855
So great.

730
00:36:10,939 --> 00:36:13,691
Of course, I went instantly to,
"It's all downhill from here.

731
00:36:13,775 --> 00:36:16,277
-Now my first Broadway play has to fail."
-No.

732
00:36:16,361 --> 00:36:18,279
We just started rehearsals again,
and I don't know.

733
00:36:18,363 --> 00:36:20,698
You always don't know at this point,
and then, it gets there.

734
00:36:20,782 --> 00:36:22,325
Do I? Because I don't remember.

735
00:36:22,409 --> 00:36:24,494
I know, it's true, it'll be great.

736
00:36:24,577 --> 00:36:26,078
Okay, I hope you're right.

737
00:36:26,621 --> 00:36:28,247
Everyone says hi.

738
00:36:30,375 --> 00:36:32,085
Tell them hi. I miss everyone.

739
00:36:32,168 --> 00:36:34,128
You'll see them again
when you come back.

740
00:36:34,212 --> 00:36:36,172
A MacArthur, Broadway...

741
00:36:36,256 --> 00:36:37,882
It's so exciting.

742
00:36:38,425 --> 00:36:40,093
Congratulations, Charlie.

743
00:36:46,891 --> 00:36:47,933
Which bathroom?

744
00:36:49,769 --> 00:36:51,145
-What?
-Is he pooping?

745
00:36:52,313 --> 00:36:53,689
Downstairs.

746
00:36:53,773 --> 00:36:54,648
Is your mom home?

747
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,484
Yeah, she's upstairs.

748
00:36:59,863 --> 00:37:01,447
- Hey, how's it going?
- Nothing yet.

749
00:37:01,531 --> 00:37:02,823
- It's me.
- I know.

750
00:37:03,324 --> 00:37:04,908
- I just got here.
- Hi.

751
00:37:04,993 --> 00:37:06,577
- I brought you something.
- Yay.

752
00:37:06,661 --> 00:37:08,537
Mom's getting me a present too.

753
00:37:08,621 --> 00:37:10,497
- Why?
- For pooping.

754
00:37:14,502 --> 00:37:16,170
- I love you.
- I love you.

755
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,215
I don't think we should reward him
for pooping anymore.

756
00:37:19,299 --> 00:37:21,634
I know, but he holds it in
and it's going on a week.

757
00:37:21,718 --> 00:37:24,387
- It's its own reward. G-ma!
- Charlie-bird!

758
00:37:24,471 --> 00:37:26,347
No! Stop it!

759
00:37:26,431 --> 00:37:28,141
God, I'm huge!

760
00:37:28,224 --> 00:37:30,226
- You're as light as a feather.
- Mom?

761
00:37:31,227 --> 00:37:34,647
-Why didn't you respond to my last e-mail?
-Well, your e-mails are so articulate.

762
00:37:34,731 --> 00:37:36,315
I get intimidated.

763
00:37:36,399 --> 00:37:38,609
- Mom, can you —
-Now, I'm going to lift you!

764
00:37:38,693 --> 00:37:41,320
Mom?

765
00:37:41,404 --> 00:37:42,405
Mom?

766
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:44,491
-Mom?
-What?

767
00:37:44,574 --> 00:37:45,908
Upstairs.

768
00:37:47,535 --> 00:37:49,245
I'm going to write you back now.

769
00:37:53,208 --> 00:37:54,375
Cassie?

770
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:56,127
Hey, Charlie.

771
00:37:56,211 --> 00:37:58,922
- I like your haircut.
- Thanks.

772
00:38:00,757 --> 00:38:02,550
- Mom?
- I'll go.

773
00:38:02,634 --> 00:38:04,552
Henry's calling you, Nicole!

774
00:38:04,636 --> 00:38:05,553
I hear him.

775
00:38:06,554 --> 00:38:08,013
What's going on, Henry?

776
00:38:08,097 --> 00:38:09,723
Can you ask Mom to come?

777
00:38:11,726 --> 00:38:12,935
He wants you.

778
00:38:15,939 --> 00:38:17,190
What kind of pie is that?

779
00:38:19,776 --> 00:38:20,610
It's...

780
00:38:25,365 --> 00:38:26,324
pecan.

781
00:38:27,742 --> 00:38:29,577
-Did you make it?
-I don't know.

782
00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:31,245
No, it's store bought.

783
00:38:31,955 --> 00:38:33,206
You know Joan's on Third?

784
00:38:33,289 --> 00:38:35,374
- Yeah. It's good, right?
- What?

785
00:38:35,458 --> 00:38:36,792
The store? Yeah.

786
00:38:37,877 --> 00:38:39,128
Jules and Molly love it.

787
00:38:39,212 --> 00:38:40,630
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

788
00:38:41,548 --> 00:38:42,799
I'm just hot!

789
00:38:44,217 --> 00:38:45,593
I'll pour you some water.

790
00:38:47,095 --> 00:38:48,721
Nicole says you're doing a play?

791
00:38:48,847 --> 00:38:50,348
I-I think you'd like it.

792
00:38:50,431 --> 00:38:54,017
It's a great unproduced play
by this really interesting British writer.

793
00:38:54,602 --> 00:38:56,395
- So, you do an English accent?
- Yeah.

794
00:38:56,479 --> 00:38:58,522
It's more northern England.

795
00:38:58,606 --> 00:38:59,732
What does that sound like?

796
00:39:01,693 --> 00:39:04,612
Ooh, you want a cup of tea, do ya?

797
00:39:04,696 --> 00:39:06,072
Laughs]

798
00:39:06,155 --> 00:39:07,948
Right. Good.

799
00:39:09,117 --> 00:39:12,495
Thank you, missus. What is...

800
00:39:13,454 --> 00:39:14,496
What's this?

801
00:39:14,581 --> 00:39:16,708
It's a manila envelope, love.

802
00:39:16,791 --> 00:39:19,168
- Ooh, can I start over?
- It has my name on it.

803
00:39:19,252 --> 00:39:20,086
Ooh.

804
00:39:25,466 --> 00:39:26,550
Jesus.

805
00:39:26,676 --> 00:39:29,011
Sorry. You're served.

806
00:39:31,306 --> 00:39:32,890
-What did you do?
-Nothing. I don't know.

807
00:39:33,391 --> 00:39:35,017
I can't lie.

808
00:39:35,101 --> 00:39:36,560
You're being served.

809
00:39:36,644 --> 00:39:39,396
You guys are getting a div...
I don't know, I'm sorry.

810
00:39:45,695 --> 00:39:48,489
I was going to warn you
so it didn't become a thing. I'm sorry.

811
00:40:02,003 --> 00:40:03,379
I feel like I'm in a dream.

812
00:40:05,131 --> 00:40:06,799
We don't have a marriage anymore.

813
00:40:06,883 --> 00:40:10,511
L-I know you don't want the disruption,
but you don't want to be married.

814
00:40:10,887 --> 00:40:12,430
Not... really.

815
00:40:14,641 --> 00:40:15,850
But I don't want this.

816
00:40:18,686 --> 00:40:21,021
What did you expect was going to happen?

817
00:40:24,275 --> 00:40:27,027
I... I don't know,
I guess I didn't think it through,

818
00:40:27,111 --> 00:40:30,656
but I thought we agreed
we weren't going to use lawyers.

819
00:40:31,115 --> 00:40:32,491
I want...

820
00:40:33,076 --> 00:40:36,621
I don't know, I'm trying to say this
as undramatically as possible.

821
00:40:36,704 --> 00:40:37,871
I want...

822
00:40:39,499 --> 00:40:41,542
an entirely different kind of life.

823
00:40:42,335 --> 00:40:44,962
Let's wait until you finish this pilot
and come back to New York.

824
00:40:45,046 --> 00:40:47,048
Let's figure it out there,
at home, together.

825
00:40:47,131 --> 00:40:50,008
-Nora's known for being very fair.
-We don't need to do it with envelopes.

826
00:40:50,093 --> 00:40:51,094
-This is Nora?
-Yeah.

827
00:40:51,177 --> 00:40:53,095
She's great. I feel like
we could be friends with her.

828
00:40:53,179 --> 00:40:56,432
-Why do I feel like that won't happen?
-It's just a formality.

829
00:40:56,516 --> 00:40:58,267
-Why...
-You don't have to respond right away.

830
00:40:58,351 --> 00:41:00,102
Why did Cassie have a pie?

831
00:41:00,186 --> 00:41:02,730
The pie was hers.
The pie wasn't part of it.

832
00:41:02,814 --> 00:41:03,773
Are you sure?

833
00:41:03,856 --> 00:41:05,899
I mean, what would the pie
have to do with anything?

834
00:41:05,984 --> 00:41:08,403
I don't know. it somehow makes it worse.

835
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,655
I'm sorry, but the pie was just a pie.

836
00:41:12,657 --> 00:41:13,699
So, what...

837
00:41:16,786 --> 00:41:17,870
What do I do?

838
00:41:20,581 --> 00:41:21,748
You get a lawyer too.

839
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:27,797
"Well, I guess l better be going.

840
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:31,133
Stuart rose from the ditch,
climbed into his car...

841
00:41:31,884 --> 00:41:34,344
and started up the road
that led toward the north.

842
00:41:35,263 --> 00:41:38,015
The sun was just coming up
over the hills on his right.

843
00:41:38,975 --> 00:41:42,478
As he peered ahead into the great land
that stretched before him,

844
00:41:43,021 --> 00:41:44,355
the way seemed long...

845
00:41:45,398 --> 00:41:46,690
but the sky was bright.

846
00:41:47,483 --> 00:41:50,360
And he somehow felt
he was headed in the right direction."

847
00:41:53,114 --> 00:41:54,990
I forgot it ended that way.

848
00:41:56,409 --> 00:41:59,578
Yeah, wow, Stuart really overreacted,
didn't you think?

849
00:42:00,329 --> 00:42:02,080
He was upset about his boat.

850
00:42:06,586 --> 00:42:07,962
Dad, you go away-

851
00:42:09,005 --> 00:42:11,257
Mom, you stay.

852
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:14,301
-Hey, Daddy just got here.
-It's okay.

853
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:16,721
Love you.

854
00:42:20,308 --> 00:42:24,729
You can come back, and wake me up,
and read to me later, Daddy, okay?

855
00:42:25,229 --> 00:42:26,230
Okay.

856
00:42:28,608 --> 00:42:30,693
Will you come sleep in my bed later?

857
00:42:30,777 --> 00:42:31,736
Yeah.

858
00:42:41,079 --> 00:42:41,954
on.

859
00:42:42,455 --> 00:42:44,498
Hang in there, Charlie-bird.

860
00:42:44,582 --> 00:42:45,624
Thanks, G-ma.

861
00:43:15,238 --> 00:43:17,531
-He's in a mommy phase right now.
-It's okay.

862
00:43:26,916 --> 00:43:27,750
Whoo!

863
00:43:27,834 --> 00:43:30,253
I'm sorry. I drank too much wine.

864
00:43:30,336 --> 00:43:32,046
-I can imagine.
-And didn't eat dinner.

865
00:43:32,130 --> 00:43:33,464
Stressful time.

866
00:43:34,507 --> 00:43:35,758
I hope Henry didn't notice.

867
00:43:35,842 --> 00:43:36,843
I'm sure he didn't.

868
00:43:36,926 --> 00:43:38,510
Now that I'm a parent,
I realize my parents

869
00:43:38,594 --> 00:43:40,178
were probably drunk all the time with me.

870
00:43:40,263 --> 00:43:41,222
Yeah.

871
00:43:41,305 --> 00:43:42,472
I'm sorry again.

872
00:43:44,267 --> 00:43:45,101
Thanks.

873
00:43:46,352 --> 00:43:47,478
Where are you staying?

874
00:43:51,065 --> 00:43:52,816
Well, I...

875
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:55,402
hadn't...

876
00:43:59,574 --> 00:44:00,575
I guess I'll...

877
00:44:02,994 --> 00:44:05,287
There's a new hotel on Highland that's...

878
00:44:06,122 --> 00:44:09,583
supposedly not too expensive
and... and pretty nice.

879
00:44:10,001 --> 00:44:11,711
Okay, I'll check it out.

880
00:44:12,295 --> 00:44:14,588
Again, that's great
about the MacArthur.

881
00:44:14,964 --> 00:44:15,798
Thanks.

882
00:44:23,556 --> 00:44:25,057
-Charlie?
-Yeah?

883
00:44:28,603 --> 00:44:29,645
Thanks.

884
00:44:36,861 --> 00:44:37,820
Fuck.

885
00:44:37,904 --> 00:44:41,115
-What?
-She's being represented by Nora.

886
00:44:41,199 --> 00:44:42,658
She's supposedly very fair?

887
00:44:42,742 --> 00:44:44,535
All right, here's the fact, Jack.

888
00:44:45,286 --> 00:44:48,163
I charge $950 an hour.

889
00:44:48,247 --> 00:44:50,082
Ted is 400.

890
00:44:50,166 --> 00:44:52,835
If you have a stupid question,
you call Ted.

891
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:57,172
To start, we'll need a $25,000 retainer.

892
00:44:57,256 --> 00:44:59,216
-That's more than I can —
-And all your financials.

893
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:00,843
We need to do a forensic accounting.

894
00:45:00,927 --> 00:45:04,430
Which runs anywhere
from ten to twenty thousand dollars.

895
00:45:05,139 --> 00:45:08,433
But if we can all agree right away,
it shouldn't get too bad, right?

896
00:45:08,517 --> 00:45:10,185
You were married here in LA?

897
00:45:10,269 --> 00:45:12,562
Yes... because her mom and sister
are out here

898
00:45:12,647 --> 00:45:15,524
-and I'm not close with my family.
-Your son was born out here?

899
00:45:15,608 --> 00:45:18,819
Yes, because, again, her mom
and sister are out here and I'm not —

900
00:45:18,903 --> 00:45:20,529
So, you got married here,

901
00:45:20,613 --> 00:45:22,323
your kid was born here...

902
00:45:23,950 --> 00:45:25,242
and she served you here?

903
00:45:25,326 --> 00:45:27,119
Yeah, but we lived in New York.

904
00:45:27,912 --> 00:45:28,996
Why?

905
00:45:30,456 --> 00:45:33,167
-Is there a problem?
-We'll have to reshape the narrative.

906
00:45:33,251 --> 00:45:36,879
If you're serious
about having your child in New York,

907
00:45:36,963 --> 00:45:38,589
this is what I suggest.

908
00:45:38,673 --> 00:45:41,550
You take your kid...
D-Did you say his name was Fred?

909
00:45:42,301 --> 00:45:43,135
Henry.

910
00:45:43,219 --> 00:45:44,136
Henry?

911
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:45,429
Why did I say Fred?

912
00:45:45,513 --> 00:45:47,014
I have a kid named Fred.

913
00:45:47,098 --> 00:45:50,643
You take Henry to New York
with you right now.

914
00:45:50,726 --> 00:45:53,019
Then we file an action in New York.

915
00:45:53,312 --> 00:45:54,730
We make this a New York case.

916
00:45:54,814 --> 00:45:56,982
We need to make an argument
you're a New York-based family.

917
00:45:57,066 --> 00:45:57,900
Well, we are.

918
00:45:57,984 --> 00:46:01,028
Otherwise, you'll probably never
see your kid outside of LA again.

919
00:46:01,112 --> 00:46:02,613
Really? No.

920
00:46:02,697 --> 00:46:05,950
It's very hard
to convince the courts to move a kid.

921
00:46:06,033 --> 00:46:09,244
As soon as you let your wife and child
leave New York,

922
00:46:09,328 --> 00:46:12,164
you made life very difficult for yourself.

923
00:46:12,248 --> 00:46:13,499
Yes, but as I said,

924
00:46:13,582 --> 00:46:16,042
we're a New York family,
that's just a fact.

925
00:46:16,919 --> 00:46:19,296
She's... here temporarily.

926
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:21,799
Then why do you think
she served you out here?

927
00:46:22,466 --> 00:46:26,595
I don't... know,
but Henry wants to go back to New York.

928
00:46:26,679 --> 00:46:28,639
Don't quote your kid.

929
00:46:29,307 --> 00:46:31,600
He's just telling you
what you want to hear.

930
00:46:32,393 --> 00:46:35,354
And trust me,
he's telling her the opposite.

931
00:46:35,438 --> 00:46:36,939
Let me have the Barber file!

932
00:46:37,023 --> 00:46:38,232
It's right here.

933
00:46:38,607 --> 00:46:40,191
Move my lunch to 1:30.

934
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:45,697
What's...

935
00:46:47,825 --> 00:46:49,701
"Exit Goat"?

936
00:46:49,785 --> 00:46:52,412
Exit Ghost. It's the name
of my theater company.

937
00:46:52,496 --> 00:46:53,663
You're a director?

938
00:46:53,748 --> 00:46:55,082
Theater director, yeah.

939
00:46:55,166 --> 00:46:58,085
-Anything I've seen?
-I don't know. What have you seen?

940
00:47:00,671 --> 00:47:02,756
Our production of Electra
is moving to Broadway...

941
00:47:04,008 --> 00:47:04,842
which is exciting.

942
00:47:04,925 --> 00:47:07,218
We have to make sure
that money is protected.

943
00:47:07,303 --> 00:47:09,847
I mean, it's theater,
so it's not a lot of money.

944
00:47:09,930 --> 00:47:12,974
I basically put whatever money I make
back in the theater.

945
00:47:13,059 --> 00:47:16,020
I wonder, do we ask for support?

946
00:47:16,562 --> 00:47:18,146
- Interesting.
- From Nicole?

947
00:47:18,230 --> 00:47:19,606
I'm not going to do that.

948
00:47:20,107 --> 00:47:21,733
Does your wife's family have money?

949
00:47:22,777 --> 00:47:25,905
Her mother has some
from her TV career.

950
00:47:25,988 --> 00:47:27,322
And her father died.

951
00:47:27,406 --> 00:47:31,868
Well, we could say that we don't want
her mother to see the kid,

952
00:47:32,203 --> 00:47:33,537
draw her into the case.

953
00:47:33,621 --> 00:47:36,749
In that instance,
her mother could pay your legal fees.

954
00:47:37,208 --> 00:47:38,167
No.

955
00:47:38,834 --> 00:47:40,544
I'm very close to her mom.

956
00:47:40,628 --> 00:47:43,547
-Nicole's family has been my family —
-Yeah, but that's going to change.

957
00:47:43,631 --> 00:47:45,466
And I suggest you get used to it.

958
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:50,012
-We need to hire a private investigator.
-Really? I mean...

959
00:47:51,722 --> 00:47:54,099
-Really?
-Does your wife do drugs or anything?

960
00:47:54,183 --> 00:47:55,017
Coke?

961
00:47:55,768 --> 00:47:57,144
Not in any real way.

962
00:47:57,228 --> 00:47:59,939
Well, we're not going to win
if she's the perfect mother.

963
00:48:00,022 --> 00:48:01,898
She was addicted to TUMS for a while.

964
00:48:02,316 --> 00:48:03,233


965
00:48:03,317 --> 00:48:06,445
It wasn't nothing.
She was up to a tube a day.

966
00:48:06,529 --> 00:48:08,364
Have you noticed anyone following you?

967
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:09,489
No.

968
00:48:10,658 --> 00:48:12,034
Well, keep an eye out.

969
00:48:12,118 --> 00:48:14,286
Look, you need to be prepared for the fact

970
00:48:14,370 --> 00:48:18,457
that Nora is going to portray you
as a neglectful, absent father.

971
00:48:18,958 --> 00:48:21,168
- But I'm not.
- You live in New York.

972
00:48:21,252 --> 00:48:22,920
You're consumed with your work.

973
00:48:23,421 --> 00:48:26,841
She and your kid are out here, struggling.

974
00:48:26,924 --> 00:48:30,302
Nora's going to use that strategy.
I'm sure of it.

975
00:48:30,386 --> 00:48:31,553
But Nicole's not going to lie.

976
00:48:31,637 --> 00:48:34,514
Listen, if we start from a place
of reasonable,

977
00:48:34,598 --> 00:48:36,891
and they start from a place of crazy,

978
00:48:36,976 --> 00:48:41,021
when we settle, we'll be somewhere
between reasonable and crazy.

979
00:48:41,105 --> 00:48:41,980
Which is still crazy.

980
00:48:42,064 --> 00:48:43,648
Half of crazy is crazy.

981
00:48:43,732 --> 00:48:46,693
You know what people say, "Criminal
lawyers see bad people at their best,

982
00:48:46,777 --> 00:48:48,862
divorce lawyers see good people
at their worst."

983
00:48:48,946 --> 00:48:51,823
Before this is all over,
you're going to hate me and Ted,

984
00:48:51,907 --> 00:48:54,534
just because of what we represent
in your life.

985
00:48:54,618 --> 00:48:55,619
I'm sure you're right.

986
00:48:55,703 --> 00:48:58,872
So tell me the story again.
You came out here to see your kid.

987
00:48:58,956 --> 00:49:00,374
-Maybe I'm not explaining this well.
-She serves you.

988
00:49:00,458 --> 00:49:02,084
-We're friendly, we're fine.
-What a bitch.

989
00:49:02,168 --> 00:49:04,211
We're just trying to figure this out.
She's not a bitch.

990
00:49:04,295 --> 00:49:05,629
Thanks, but this isn't...

991
00:49:05,713 --> 00:49:07,047
We're doing it a different way.

992
00:49:07,423 --> 00:49:10,134
And... I can't even close to afford this.

993
00:49:10,509 --> 00:49:14,387
I've got to get back to New York.
I have a Broadway play in rehearsals.

994
00:49:18,642 --> 00:49:22,103
I was the hot shit at that time.

995
00:49:22,188 --> 00:49:26,688
Young, very sexy,
with a great head of hair.

996
00:49:27,234 --> 00:49:29,945
I just so appreciate that Charlie
gave me this opportunity.

997
00:49:30,029 --> 00:49:31,321
Or maybe I should thank Nicole.

998
00:49:31,405 --> 00:49:33,990
I heard Nicole's pilot went to series,
so she's moving to LA.

999
00:49:34,074 --> 00:49:35,658
And they put Henry in school out there.

1000
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:36,952
Well, is Charlie moving too?

1001
00:49:37,036 --> 00:49:38,120
Not Charlie.

1002
00:49:38,204 --> 00:49:39,413
He won't abandon us.

1003
00:49:39,497 --> 00:49:41,123
And you can't do theater in LA.

1004
00:49:41,207 --> 00:49:43,584
Charlie said she and Henry
are coming back to New York

1005
00:49:43,667 --> 00:49:45,418
when she finishes filming her show.

1006
00:49:45,503 --> 00:49:46,921
I wouldn't be so sure.

1007
00:49:47,004 --> 00:49:49,923
Nicole was never going to stay
in New York, that was obvious.

1008
00:49:50,007 --> 00:49:52,009
She was probably
planning this move all along.

1009
00:49:52,092 --> 00:49:55,428
When she sees an opportunity,
believe me, she takes it.

1010
00:49:55,513 --> 00:49:57,640
Well, LA is nice.

1011
00:49:58,057 --> 00:49:58,974
The space.

1012
00:49:59,058 --> 00:50:02,227
Miss Four Time Oscar winner, sucking my...

1013
00:50:02,311 --> 00:50:04,396
Okay, how is everyone today?

1014
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:06,607
Nobody get too close.
I think I caught Donna's cold.

1015
00:50:06,690 --> 00:50:09,484
-Sorry, Charlie.
-I'm expecting a Skype call from Henry,

1016
00:50:09,568 --> 00:50:11,319
so I might have to step out.

1017
00:50:12,488 --> 00:50:14,865
So, Charlie, what you're going through now

1018
00:50:14,949 --> 00:50:18,243
is going to be horrible,
but it will be over.

1019
00:50:18,327 --> 00:50:19,494
Thanks, Frank.

1020
00:50:19,870 --> 00:50:21,079
-Another thing.
-Yeah?

1021
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:25,709
Fuck as many people as you can right now.

1022
00:50:25,793 --> 00:50:28,003
Women, men.

1023
00:50:28,671 --> 00:50:31,173
-Take what I said seriously.
-You might need help wrapping gauze.

1024
00:50:31,257 --> 00:50:33,968
-It needs to stay tight.
-Okay, I'm — I'm confused.

1025
00:50:34,051 --> 00:50:36,219
What... scene
is the Invisible Man outfit for?

1026
00:50:36,303 --> 00:50:38,263
No, that's my Halloween costume.

1027
00:50:38,347 --> 00:50:40,891
And the Frankenstein
is for Henry.

1028
00:50:42,643 --> 00:50:43,810
He's coming here this weekend.

1029
00:50:43,894 --> 00:50:45,770
We're going to trick or treat
in the Slope.

1030
00:50:45,854 --> 00:50:48,147
I made it more James Whale
than Kenneth Branagh.

1031
00:50:48,232 --> 00:50:49,942
-Perfect.
-Can I talk to you?

1032
00:50:50,651 --> 00:50:52,402
Yeah, over...

1033
00:50:53,028 --> 00:50:55,280
I've typed up the blocking
from the last two rehearsals,

1034
00:50:55,364 --> 00:50:59,326
and here are the director notes
from that Danish production from the '70s.

1035
00:51:00,411 --> 00:51:01,328
Where'd you find it?

1036
00:51:01,412 --> 00:51:03,997
-The library, duh.
-Ha!

1037
00:51:04,331 --> 00:51:05,540
Can I come over tonight?

1038
00:51:06,959 --> 00:51:08,961
Mary Ann, it's too hard now.

1039
00:51:09,044 --> 00:51:10,962
I just can't be with anyone right now.

1040
00:51:11,046 --> 00:51:13,882
But we did it when you were married
and we shouldn't have done it.

1041
00:51:13,966 --> 00:51:16,301
And now that you're not married,
shouldn't we be doing it?

1042
00:51:16,385 --> 00:51:19,388
I'm not not married yet.

1043
00:51:19,888 --> 00:51:21,598
You're torturing yourself.

1044
00:51:21,849 --> 00:51:23,767
Just make sure
everything doesn't go to hell.

1045
00:51:25,019 --> 00:51:27,021
-I'm relying on you, okay?
-Fine.

1046
00:51:27,104 --> 00:51:29,648
-Thanks.
-I wish you'd accept generosity better.

1047
00:51:29,732 --> 00:51:31,024
Hold on. Let me...

1048
00:51:31,442 --> 00:51:33,360
- Hello?
- Is this Charlie Barber?

1049
00:51:33,861 --> 00:51:34,695
Yes.

1050
00:51:34,778 --> 00:51:36,571
Hi, this is Nora Fanshaw.

1051
00:51:36,655 --> 00:51:38,531
I represent your wife, Nicole Barber.

1052
00:51:38,657 --> 00:51:40,742
- Hi.
- Do you have an attorney yet?

1053
00:51:40,826 --> 00:51:41,660
No.

1054
00:51:41,744 --> 00:51:44,246
Okay, then it is okay for me
to talk to you directly, okay?

1055
00:51:44,330 --> 00:51:45,205
Okay.

1056
00:51:45,664 --> 00:51:48,833
I 'm calling because we haven't
received your response to our filing.

1057
00:51:49,251 --> 00:51:52,379
Yeah, I've been rehearsing this play
and flying back and forth to LA.

1058
00:51:52,463 --> 00:51:54,548
You're going to need
to file your response.

1059
00:51:56,508 --> 00:51:59,260
- Nicole said there was no rush.
- It's been more than 30 days

1060
00:51:59,345 --> 00:52:00,179
since you were served.

1061
00:52:00,262 --> 00:52:02,222
By law, you're meant to respond
within 30 days.

1062
00:52:02,306 --> 00:52:03,765
I didn't like the first lawyer I met.

1063
00:52:03,849 --> 00:52:06,309
It says that very clearly
on the document you were given.

1064
00:52:06,393 --> 00:52:07,268
Did you read it?

1065
00:52:07,353 --> 00:52:09,104
Yeah, but I thought
that's just what it says.

1066
00:52:09,188 --> 00:52:10,939
We weren't even going to do it
with lawyers.

1067
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:14,150
Charlie, I think I shouldn't
tuck in my shirt.

1068
00:52:14,234 --> 00:52:17,195
- Nicole said I could take my time.
- And we've let you take your time.

1069
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:20,407
-Keeps coming out during the love scene.
-Could you hold a second? What love scene?

1070
00:52:20,491 --> 00:52:21,825
When I hug Beth.

1071
00:52:21,909 --> 00:52:23,118
You don't hug Beth.

1072
00:52:23,202 --> 00:52:25,329
I think it's something we should explore.

1073
00:52:25,412 --> 00:52:28,331
Can't you just tuck it in tighter
or get Donna to safety pin it?

1074
00:52:28,415 --> 00:52:30,250
I also have a kind of a thing

1075
00:52:30,334 --> 00:52:32,878
- about, tucking things in.
- Charlie?

1076
00:52:32,961 --> 00:52:34,295
If you don't file your response,

1077
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:36,799
we 're going to file a request
for default judgment against you.

1078
00:52:36,882 --> 00:52:39,759
...insecurities about my figure.

1079
00:52:39,843 --> 00:52:41,052
- Charlie?
- Yes, sorry.

1080
00:52:41,136 --> 00:52:43,304
Default judgment, what does that mean?
Don't hug Beth.

1081
00:52:43,389 --> 00:52:45,432
We 'll be able to lay claim
to whatever we want.

1082
00:52:45,516 --> 00:52:47,392
W-What do you mean,
whatever you want of what?

1083
00:52:47,476 --> 00:52:49,895
Your apartment, your things,
everything you own.

1084
00:52:49,978 --> 00:52:50,812
We...

1085
00:52:50,896 --> 00:52:53,732
She and I already discussed this.
We don't own that much stuff.

1086
00:52:53,816 --> 00:52:55,442
She can have
pretty much whatever she wants.

1087
00:52:55,526 --> 00:52:58,570
And it means we 'll set the number
for child support at its highest level

1088
00:52:58,654 --> 00:53:00,530
and claim full custody of your child.

1089
00:53:02,741 --> 00:53:03,658
Full custody?

1090
00:53:05,411 --> 00:53:08,038
- I mean, that's not even —
-This is what the law says.

1091
00:53:08,997 --> 00:53:12,041
Nicole's not going to do that.
I mean, she won't.

1092
00:53:12,126 --> 00:53:13,877
No, Charlie, l represent Nicole,

1093
00:53:13,961 --> 00:53:16,254
and she's aware of everything
I'm saying to you.

1094
00:53:16,338 --> 00:53:17,630
I just spoke to her this morning.

1095
00:53:17,715 --> 00:53:20,926
Well, I spoke to her five minutes
before I go! on the call.

1096
00:53:24,346 --> 00:53:25,347
Okay, so what do I do?

1097
00:53:25,431 --> 00:53:27,724
You need to get a lawyer
and respond immediately.

1098
00:53:27,808 --> 00:53:31,186
Nicole wants to do this amicably,
but you're leaving us no other option.

1099
00:53:31,270 --> 00:53:33,021
I'll get a lawyer.
Can I get a lawyer here?

1100
00:53:33,105 --> 00:53:35,065
- I don't know where "here " is.
- New York.

1101
00:53:35,149 --> 00:53:37,442
I That's what all that honking is ?

1102
00:53:38,152 --> 00:53:40,154
No, you'll have to come to LA
and meet people in LA.

1103
00:53:40,237 --> 00:53:41,196
I'm rehearsing a —

1104
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:44,658
If you don't respond in Los Angeles by Friday, you'll leave us no choice.

1105
00:53:44,742 --> 00:53:46,368
Wh — Which line?

1106
00:53:47,035 --> 00:53:49,746
I have to take this.
Can you hold on a second, Charlie ?

1107
00:54:16,565 --> 00:54:19,651
Me and Mommy are in the middle
of a super secret treasure hunt.

1108
00:54:20,611 --> 00:54:23,196
-I thought the plane landed at nine.
-What are you wearing?

1109
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:24,364
Sock pants.

1110
00:54:24,448 --> 00:54:26,074
It did. What are sock pants?

1111
00:54:26,158 --> 00:54:28,076
He doesn't like to feel the breeze
on his legs.

1112
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:29,202
He dressed himself.

1113
00:54:29,286 --> 00:54:31,329
-There are long pants. Can I talk to you?
-It's almost noon.

1114
00:54:31,413 --> 00:54:33,331
There was traffic. We've got to get going.

1115
00:54:33,415 --> 00:54:36,167
-Why don't we ever do a treasure hunt?
-Henry, can you wait a minute?

1116
00:54:36,251 --> 00:54:37,377
No talking alone.

1117
00:54:37,461 --> 00:54:39,671
Just one bit of talking alone,
then I'll be right there.

1118
00:54:40,005 --> 00:54:41,506
I got a call from your lawyer.

1119
00:54:41,590 --> 00:54:44,092
She said you'd take everything and...

1120
00:54:45,177 --> 00:54:47,179
custody and everything
if I didn't respond.

1121
00:54:47,262 --> 00:54:49,013
It's better if we just
let the lawyers do this.

1122
00:54:49,097 --> 00:54:51,265
Yeah, but she's saying things
I don't think you mean.

1123
00:54:51,350 --> 00:54:53,018
Henry, we need to get going.

1124
00:54:53,101 --> 00:54:54,560
I don't want to go now.

1125
00:54:54,645 --> 00:54:56,938
-Have you gotten a lawyer yet?
-That's what I'm here to do.

1126
00:54:57,022 --> 00:54:58,565
Come on, Henry. I'm in a rush.

1127
00:54:58,649 --> 00:54:59,816
I have three more clues.

1128
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:02,444
Why did you start a treasure hunt
or whatever so close to my arrival?

1129
00:55:02,528 --> 00:55:04,613
-Cool.
-You were late. We were killing time.

1130
00:55:04,696 --> 00:55:07,073
Honey, come. We're going to finish
the treasure hunt later.

1131
00:55:07,157 --> 00:55:08,741
- I'm going to be rich!
- Okay.

1132
00:55:08,826 --> 00:55:10,994
You're going to go with your daddy.
It's going to be fun.

1133
00:55:11,078 --> 00:55:14,331
And I've got a present for you
when you get back as a reward.

1134
00:55:15,207 --> 00:55:16,416
He's not going to the dentist.

1135
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:18,418
-I'm trying to help.
-I'm staying here.

1136
00:55:18,502 --> 00:55:19,336
Come on.

1137
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:24,174
Henry?

1138
00:55:29,805 --> 00:55:32,307
- Got the booster?
- I have a booster.

1139
00:55:34,101 --> 00:55:35,727
Wait, no, it's not in.

1140
00:55:36,103 --> 00:55:36,978
What's not in?

1141
00:55:37,437 --> 00:55:39,439
The seat's not connected.

1142
00:55:42,526 --> 00:55:44,194
I asked the rental company to install it.

1143
00:55:44,278 --> 00:55:47,197
Yeah, I think they can't
for liability reasons.

1144
00:55:47,281 --> 00:55:49,491
-Do you know how these things —
-Let me just... If you...

1145
00:55:49,575 --> 00:55:52,286
- There should be a clip to clip onto.
- ...dig...

1146
00:55:54,955 --> 00:55:56,498
{effort grunts]

1147
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:58,583
Fuck!

1148
00:55:58,667 --> 00:56:00,669
- Why "fuck?"
- Something sharp.

1149
00:56:00,752 --> 00:56:01,919
-Can't I stay with Mom?
-No.

1150
00:56:02,004 --> 00:56:03,046
Why not?

1151
00:56:03,130 --> 00:56:05,132
It's my time with you.
I just flew 3,000 miles.

1152
00:56:05,215 --> 00:56:06,090
I don't want to.

1153
00:56:06,174 --> 00:56:07,675
Henry, get in the fucking car!

1154
00:56:09,845 --> 00:56:12,097
I'm sorry, but Jesus,
get in the fucking car.

1155
00:56:17,185 --> 00:56:19,353
How do you spell LEGO Bionicles?

1156
00:56:19,438 --> 00:56:21,815
That's two words.
What does LEGO start with?

1157
00:56:21,899 --> 00:56:22,941
Just tell me.

1158
00:56:23,025 --> 00:56:24,234
-Don't you want to learn it?
-No.

1159
00:56:24,318 --> 00:56:25,736
-It's on the box, anyway.
-L...

1160
00:56:25,819 --> 00:56:26,861
Then what?

1161
00:56:26,945 --> 00:56:29,739
E... You know,
everyone at the theater says hi.

1162
00:56:29,823 --> 00:56:30,782
Hi.

1163
00:56:30,866 --> 00:56:31,741
Then what?

1164
00:56:31,825 --> 00:56:33,368
A "♪-♪-♪" sound.

1165
00:56:33,452 --> 00:56:35,412
-Are you excited for Halloween?
-J?

1166
00:56:35,495 --> 00:56:36,329
G-

1167
00:56:36,413 --> 00:56:38,081
- Then what?
- And an "O" sound.

1168
00:56:38,165 --> 00:56:40,292
-O?
-Are you excited for Halloween?

1169
00:56:40,375 --> 00:56:41,334
Yeah.

1170
00:56:41,418 --> 00:56:42,877
I brought both our costumes.

1171
00:56:42,961 --> 00:56:45,254
I'm going as a store-bought ninja.

1172
00:56:45,339 --> 00:56:47,466
But we agreed.
I had Donna make you a Frankenstein.

1173
00:56:47,549 --> 00:56:49,717
I don't want to be a Frankenstein anymore.

1174
00:56:49,801 --> 00:56:50,718
Are you sure?

1175
00:56:52,471 --> 00:56:53,513
Maybe just look at it.

1176
00:56:54,056 --> 00:56:56,767
It's awesome. We'll be Frankenstein
and the Invisible Man.

1177
00:56:56,850 --> 00:56:58,893
Mom bought me a ninja costume,

1178
00:56:58,977 --> 00:57:01,562
which is better because it costs more.

1179
00:57:01,647 --> 00:57:03,273
Technically, the Frankenstein cost more

1180
00:57:03,357 --> 00:57:05,442
when you factor in Donna's time
and the materials.

1181
00:57:05,525 --> 00:57:07,777
The cousins are also going to be ninjas.

1182
00:57:07,861 --> 00:57:09,654
But Henry,
we went through all this trouble.

1183
00:57:13,325 --> 00:57:14,367
Okay.

1184
00:57:14,451 --> 00:57:15,410
Whatever you want.

1185
00:57:19,998 --> 00:57:22,709
Please take the ticket.

1186
00:57:26,838 --> 00:57:28,673
- Dad, you're too far.
- I know.

1187
00:57:28,757 --> 00:57:31,426
Please take the ticket.

1188
00:57:38,141 --> 00:57:40,434
So, I'm not comfortable
leaving the bags in the car

1189
00:57:40,519 --> 00:57:42,646
where I've given the key to someone
I don't really know.

1190
00:57:42,729 --> 00:57:43,896
I've been here.

1191
00:57:43,981 --> 00:57:47,317
It's an office building,
so you've been to places like this before.

1192
00:57:47,818 --> 00:57:49,402
I remember those fish.

1193
00:57:50,696 --> 00:57:52,114
A lot of fish look the same.

1194
00:57:52,531 --> 00:57:53,532
Can I help you?

1195
00:57:53,615 --> 00:57:56,117
I'm Charlie Barber.
I have a 1:30 with Dan Cohen.

1196
00:57:56,201 --> 00:57:57,952
Hi. Where's your little man?

1197
00:57:58,036 --> 00:58:01,497
I don't have it this time.
I keep my skeletons at my mom's.

1198
00:58:01,581 --> 00:58:02,415
Okay.

1199
00:58:03,917 --> 00:58:04,834
Okay.

1200
00:58:04,918 --> 00:58:07,045
I'm sorry. We tried to reach you.

1201
00:58:07,129 --> 00:58:08,922
Mr. Cohen wanted me to apologize.

1202
00:58:09,006 --> 00:58:12,175
He can't see you because apparently
your wife already met with him

1203
00:58:12,259 --> 00:58:14,511
on the 7th of August about representation.

1204
00:58:15,303 --> 00:58:16,679
B-But she hired somebody else.

1205
00:58:16,763 --> 00:58:19,098
- ... Nora —
-Fanshaw?

1206
00:58:19,391 --> 00:58:21,893
But unfortunately, because she consulted
with Mr. Cohen already,

1207
00:58:21,977 --> 00:58:23,979
he's legally barred from representing you.

1208
00:58:25,605 --> 00:58:27,315
- Should we feed the fish?
- Yeah.

1209
00:58:27,858 --> 00:58:30,235
- it happens all the time.
- Really?

1210
00:58:30,318 --> 00:58:32,611
If you have a ticket,
I can validate your parking.

1211
00:58:34,364 --> 00:58:37,283
You know, it's common that people
meet with as many lawyers as possible

1212
00:58:37,367 --> 00:58:39,285
so that their spouse has limited options.

1213
00:58:39,369 --> 00:58:41,454
I don't think
she would've done it deliberately.

1214
00:58:41,538 --> 00:58:42,997
You'd be surprised.

1215
00:58:43,081 --> 00:58:45,625
Can all of them, like,
breathe out of the water?

1216
00:58:47,294 --> 00:58:49,421
Did you go to a lot of offices
with your mom?

1217
00:58:49,504 --> 00:58:50,630
Not so many.

1218
00:58:52,257 --> 00:58:53,216
Like 11.

1219
00:58:53,633 --> 00:58:56,177
I don't think anyone
would have stealed the bags, Daddy.

1220
00:58:56,261 --> 00:58:57,428
I need somebody today.

1221
00:58:57,512 --> 00:59:00,223
If I don't respond by tomorrow,
she said I could lose custody.

1222
00:59:00,307 --> 00:59:03,143
I didn't know who else to call.
There's got to be someone she didn't meet.

1223
00:59:03,226 --> 00:59:04,352
I have a name for you.

1224
00:59:05,395 --> 00:59:07,271
Bert Spitz.

1225
00:59:07,814 --> 00:59:11,108
He was the entertainment lawyer
at Roberta's agency.

1226
00:59:11,526 --> 00:59:12,360
Great.

1227
00:59:12,444 --> 00:59:15,905
But then he kind of got pushed
into retirement a few years ago,

1228
00:59:16,198 --> 00:59:18,033
and he went into family law.

1229
00:59:18,116 --> 00:59:19,951
-I called him.
-Thank you, G-ma.

1230
00:59:20,035 --> 00:59:22,704
- He can see you today at three.
- Aw, shit.

1231
00:59:23,371 --> 00:59:26,123
We never had this conversation,
Charlie-bird.

1232
00:59:26,208 --> 00:59:27,292
You got it. I love you.

1233
00:59:27,375 --> 00:59:28,334
- Aw.
- Dad!

1234
00:59:28,418 --> 00:59:31,003
-I need a new burger.
-Why?

1235
00:59:31,088 --> 00:59:35,509
Because you made us carry your bags
into the restaurant, I dropped it.

1236
00:59:36,885 --> 00:59:39,429
That's fine. I'll give you mine.
Get in the car.

1237
00:59:39,513 --> 00:59:42,307
Why did you bring me today
if you couldn't hang out with me?

1238
00:59:42,390 --> 00:59:44,308
Because I've been away
and want to see you.

1239
00:59:45,060 --> 00:59:48,396
Jamie Tuber has a little sister...

1240
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:50,940
...named, um, Lily Tuber.

1241
00:59:51,024 --> 00:59:53,276
-Yeah.
-And Lily Tuber is really bossy.

1242
00:59:55,529 --> 00:59:59,324
Getting divorced with a kid can be
one of the hardest things you'll ever do.

1243
01:00:00,992 --> 01:00:02,868
It's like a death without a body.

1244
01:00:05,038 --> 01:00:08,332
I know personally.
I've been there four different times.

1245
01:00:08,416 --> 01:00:10,042
You've been divorced four times?

1246
01:00:10,127 --> 01:00:11,253
Married four times.

1247
01:00:11,336 --> 01:00:12,837
Three divorces.

1248
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:16,215
This last one will stick, God willing.

1249
01:00:16,299 --> 01:00:18,968
That's why I graduated into family law,

1250
01:00:19,052 --> 01:00:21,220
to help people survive this painful time.

1251
01:00:22,973 --> 01:00:24,391
Here's how I see it.

1252
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:28,561
If we get bogged down
in "who did this," and "who did that,"

1253
01:00:28,645 --> 01:00:30,271
and "I don't want to pay the two dollars,"

1254
01:00:30,355 --> 01:00:33,024
it'll just cost you more money
and time and...

1255
01:00:34,025 --> 01:00:35,151
emotional stress,

1256
01:00:35,235 --> 01:00:37,612
and you'll probably end up
with the same result anyway.

1257
01:00:37,696 --> 01:00:38,863
Right.

1258
01:00:38,947 --> 01:00:41,866
I mean, I agree with that philosophy.
She does too, I'm sure.

1259
01:00:41,950 --> 01:00:45,286
And I always go with the truth,
no matter where that takes us.

1260
01:00:45,370 --> 01:00:47,455
You know, most people in my business
make up the truth

1261
01:00:47,539 --> 01:00:49,040
so they can get where they need to go.

1262
01:00:49,583 --> 01:00:51,710
You're just transactions to them.

1263
01:00:51,793 --> 01:00:53,669
L-I like to think of you as people.

1264
01:00:53,753 --> 01:00:55,546
Okay, good.

1265
01:00:55,630 --> 01:00:57,089
And not just you, her too.

1266
01:00:57,174 --> 01:00:58,008
Yes.

1267
01:00:58,091 --> 01:01:00,218
You know, this can be
a really ugly process.

1268
01:01:00,302 --> 01:01:03,179
But I also believe
it doesn't have to be terrible.

1269
01:01:03,263 --> 01:01:04,639
I'm glad to hear you say that.

1270
01:01:05,182 --> 01:01:06,016
Um...

1271
01:01:06,766 --> 01:01:09,143
I'd love to keep expenses down
as much as possible.

1272
01:01:09,227 --> 01:01:10,228
Of course you do.

1273
01:01:10,812 --> 01:01:14,816
I charge 450 an hour
and I need a $10,000 retainer to start.

1274
01:01:15,775 --> 01:01:18,319
I'll see if I can get an advance
on the Broadway transfer.

1275
01:01:18,403 --> 01:01:21,322
And keep in mind,
you'll have to pay for her lawyer.

1276
01:01:21,406 --> 01:01:22,907
I didn't...

1277
01:01:25,452 --> 01:01:27,370
- What?
- Well, at least part of her.

1278
01:01:27,454 --> 01:01:29,330
It doesn't make sense, does it?

1279
01:01:29,414 --> 01:01:32,458
I mean, you're doing this
because you love your kid.

1280
01:01:33,126 --> 01:01:36,420
And in doing so, you're draining money
from your kid's education.

1281
01:01:36,504 --> 01:01:38,547
- It seems ridiculous.
- It is.

1282
01:01:38,632 --> 01:01:39,883
It is, boy.

1283
01:01:41,468 --> 01:01:43,261
We'll have to respond right away.

1284
01:01:44,888 --> 01:01:46,514
Your son goes to school out here?

1285
01:01:46,598 --> 01:01:48,891
Yeah, temporarily. We agreed.

1286
01:01:49,351 --> 01:01:51,936
Her pilot went to series
and I wanted to accommodate her,

1287
01:01:52,020 --> 01:01:54,147
as she's often felt
we do things on my terms.

1288
01:01:54,231 --> 01:01:56,691
Be a better husband in divorce.

1289
01:01:56,775 --> 01:01:59,444
I guess something like that,
but we live in New York.

1290
01:02:00,570 --> 01:02:02,446
Well, with your kid
going to school out here,

1291
01:02:02,530 --> 01:02:04,031
the court may see it differently.

1292
01:02:04,115 --> 01:02:05,157
Will we go to court?

1293
01:02:05,242 --> 01:02:07,619
No, no, we don't want to go to court.

1294
01:02:07,702 --> 01:02:09,412
The courts in California are a disaster.

1295
01:02:09,496 --> 01:02:11,539
No, that's just how
we have to think about it.

1296
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:13,791
I'm not sure these are my glasses.

1297
01:02:14,167 --> 01:02:15,877
Where are you living while you're here?

1298
01:02:15,961 --> 01:02:17,253
I'm in a hotel right now.

1299
01:02:17,337 --> 01:02:18,546
No, a hotel doesn't look good.

1300
01:02:18,630 --> 01:02:20,089
-To who?
-The court.

1301
01:02:20,173 --> 01:02:22,133
You just said
we weren't going to go to court.

1302
01:02:22,217 --> 01:02:23,384
No, of course, of course.

1303
01:02:23,468 --> 01:02:26,012
We have to prepare to go to court,
hoping we don't go to court.

1304
01:02:26,096 --> 01:02:26,930
Okay.

1305
01:02:27,430 --> 01:02:28,889
You should get a place in LA.

1306
01:02:29,432 --> 01:02:32,059
And get a place near her.
It looks better for custody reasons.

1307
01:02:32,143 --> 01:02:34,436
She's in West Hollywood.
That'll be expensive.

1308
01:02:34,521 --> 01:02:36,439
L-I guess I could rent
our New York apartment.

1309
01:02:36,523 --> 01:02:37,357
Don't rent it.

1310
01:02:37,857 --> 01:02:40,067
You have to continue to prove
New York residence.

1311
01:02:40,151 --> 01:02:42,278
And of course, if you have a place in LA,

1312
01:02:42,362 --> 01:02:44,739
it's hard to show you all live
in New York, isn't it?

1313
01:02:44,823 --> 01:02:45,782
So...

1314
01:02:46,783 --> 01:02:47,909
what do I do?

1315
01:02:48,034 --> 01:02:51,370
I recommend you spend
as much time as you can with your son.

1316
01:02:52,289 --> 01:02:54,249
Many people fight for that time,

1317
01:02:54,332 --> 01:02:55,750
then they don't even use it.

1318
01:02:56,293 --> 01:02:57,877
They just want to win.

1319
01:02:57,961 --> 01:03:00,296
This shouldn't be
that complicated, right?

1320
01:03:00,380 --> 01:03:02,173
I mean, we're a New York family.

1321
01:03:02,257 --> 01:03:04,759
I think it's all pretty straightforward.
Right?

1322
01:03:04,843 --> 01:03:06,886
I hope so, yes.

1323
01:03:07,804 --> 01:03:09,263
I see no reason...

1324
01:03:10,015 --> 01:03:12,142
You both love your child.

1325
01:03:13,143 --> 01:03:14,310
You respect each other.

1326
01:03:14,644 --> 01:03:16,812
Why this shouldn't be
relatively pain-free.

1327
01:03:16,896 --> 01:03:17,980
Right.

1328
01:03:18,064 --> 01:03:19,982
I think you have my glasses.

1329
01:03:22,319 --> 01:03:23,611
That makes sense.

1330
01:03:24,654 --> 01:03:27,365
- What have you been doing?
- Reading this magazine.

1331
01:03:27,449 --> 01:03:29,409
You were reading California Lawyer?

1332
01:03:29,492 --> 01:03:30,326
Yeah.

1333
01:03:30,410 --> 01:03:33,079
Okay, I'm almost done.

1334
01:03:33,163 --> 01:03:35,582
I wouldn't expect too much from that cat.

1335
01:03:37,751 --> 01:03:40,378
-What kind of pet do you want?
-I don't know...

1336
01:03:40,462 --> 01:03:43,214
I want you to know
that eventually this will all be over,

1337
01:03:43,298 --> 01:03:45,091
and whatever we win or lose...

1338
01:03:45,675 --> 01:03:48,594
it'll be the two of you
having to figure this out together.

1339
01:03:49,304 --> 01:03:50,388
Thank you.

1340
01:03:50,472 --> 01:03:54,225
You're the first person in this process
who's spoken to me like a human.

1341
01:03:59,314 --> 01:04:01,816
You remind me of myself
on my second marriage.

1342
01:04:05,904 --> 01:04:07,822
Come! Come! Come! Come!

1343
01:04:07,906 --> 01:04:09,532
You have fun with Daddy?

1344
01:04:09,616 --> 01:04:11,743
We drove around to offices.

1345
01:04:11,826 --> 01:04:14,620
Do you want to see your ninja costume?
It's on G-ma's bed.

1346
01:04:14,704 --> 01:04:16,122
-Yeah!
-Yeah.

1347
01:04:17,874 --> 01:04:20,793
You know, I had Donna build him
this whole Frankenstein thing

1348
01:04:20,877 --> 01:04:22,378
with the plugs and —

1349
01:04:22,462 --> 01:04:24,881
Yeah, well, the cousins are ninjas,
so he wanted to do that —

1350
01:04:24,964 --> 01:04:26,799
But he and I had decided together.

1351
01:04:26,883 --> 01:04:28,551
Well, I can't make him
be Frankenstein.

1352
01:04:28,635 --> 01:04:31,012
I'm not asking you to,
but maybe you can help me out a little.

1353
01:04:31,096 --> 01:04:34,015
I'll leave the Frankenstein here, maybe
you can nudge him in that direction.

1354
01:04:34,516 --> 01:04:35,517
I'll try.

1355
01:04:36,976 --> 01:04:37,893
What's the...

1356
01:04:39,062 --> 01:04:41,022
Did you dye your hair again?
Is that for your show?

1357
01:04:41,564 --> 01:04:44,191
No, this is me. it was this way
when I saw you before.

1358
01:04:44,275 --> 01:04:46,068
I know, but I didn't say anything then.

1359
01:04:47,195 --> 01:04:48,404
You don't like it?

1360
01:04:48,488 --> 01:04:51,782
No, I guess it's fine.
Is it shorter? I prefer longer, but...

1361
01:04:52,742 --> 01:04:53,617


1362
01:04:54,619 --> 01:04:56,829
Sorry, it's just absurd.

1363
01:04:57,455 --> 01:04:58,539
Is everything okay?

1364
01:04:58,623 --> 01:05:00,249
Yeah. Why?

1365
01:05:00,917 --> 01:05:03,294
You seem, I don't know,
like something is —

1366
01:05:03,378 --> 01:05:04,504
Everything's fine.

1367
01:05:06,506 --> 01:05:08,216
Okay, I'm going to check in at the hotel,

1368
01:05:08,299 --> 01:05:11,260
but I should be able to get to you guys
by 5:00, 5:30 —

1369
01:05:11,344 --> 01:05:13,804
We're going to Cassie's in Pasadena

1370
01:05:13,888 --> 01:05:15,598
and trick-or-treating with the cousins.

1371
01:05:15,682 --> 01:05:16,849
Cassie lives in Pasadena now?

1372
01:05:16,933 --> 01:05:19,352
Yes. She and Sam moved there
a couple months ago.

1373
01:05:19,436 --> 01:05:20,645
Okay, I don't really know Pasadena.

1374
01:05:20,728 --> 01:05:23,647
-I'll figure it out. What's the address?
-My mom is looking forward to it...

1375
01:05:23,731 --> 01:05:25,691
-I'll text Sam.
-...and Cassie and Sam are mad.

1376
01:05:25,775 --> 01:05:27,151
-Mad at who?
-You.

1377
01:05:27,235 --> 01:05:29,403
- Cassie and Sam?
- You can understand that.

1378
01:05:29,487 --> 01:05:31,697
So, I think we should probably do
separate Halloweens.

1379
01:05:31,781 --> 01:05:34,283
But if you're okay with it,
then shouldn't they be okay with it?

1380
01:05:34,367 --> 01:05:36,619
-Let's do it this way this time.
-Do you not want me there?

1381
01:05:36,703 --> 01:05:37,578
I'm fine with it.

1382
01:05:37,662 --> 01:05:39,622
- Okay.
- It'll be nice for him.

1383
01:05:39,706 --> 01:05:41,082
He'll have two Halloweens.

1384
01:05:41,958 --> 01:05:45,336
What am I going to do with him for second
Halloween? Walk around Sunset Boulevard?

1385
01:05:45,420 --> 01:05:49,132
Maybe the hotel has something. Or you can
drive to a different neighborhood.

1386
01:05:52,760 --> 01:05:55,554
The sun sets forever.

1387
01:05:56,931 --> 01:05:59,850
There shall never be another dawn.

1388
01:06:00,977 --> 01:06:01,811
No!

1389
01:06:03,563 --> 01:06:05,356
Lady...

1390
01:06:05,857 --> 01:06:08,818
I require the solace of the shadows...

1391
01:06:09,861 --> 01:06:11,195
and the dark!

1392
01:06:30,632 --> 01:06:33,551
Okay, ready for Halloween?

1393
01:06:34,469 --> 01:06:36,179
-Hi.
-Wow, elaborate.

1394
01:06:36,721 --> 01:06:39,140
Sweetheart, don't forget to wear
your jacket. It's getting colder.

1395
01:06:39,224 --> 01:06:41,309
- This is a nice house.
- Ready to go back out?

1396
01:06:41,392 --> 01:06:42,810
- He has to pee.
- No, I don't.

1397
01:06:42,894 --> 01:06:43,728
He does.

1398
01:06:44,145 --> 01:06:46,355
Some of his men are in here
and also Bear-Bear.

1399
01:06:46,439 --> 01:06:48,482
You can keep that Bear-Bear,
because I got another one.

1400
01:06:48,566 --> 01:06:50,192
Does he know
that there are two Bear-Bears?

1401
01:06:50,276 --> 01:06:52,820
-It was his idea.
-David Bowie, right? Station to Station?

1402
01:06:53,404 --> 01:06:54,905
Let's Dance.

1403
01:06:54,989 --> 01:06:57,741
Henry, have a great Halloween
with Daddy, okay?

1404
01:06:59,661 --> 01:07:00,536
Have fun.

1405
01:07:03,915 --> 01:07:05,791
Go pee and then we're going back out.

1406
01:07:06,209 --> 01:07:07,710
I'm too tired.

1407
01:07:07,794 --> 01:07:10,338
Go pee, and then
we're going to go drive to Halloween.

1408
01:07:10,755 --> 01:07:12,590
This block looks promising.

1409
01:07:13,383 --> 01:07:14,717
I wish Halloween was over.

1410
01:07:14,801 --> 01:07:16,469
Well, it isn't.

1411
01:07:16,553 --> 01:07:19,013
If we were in New York,
we could be walking.

1412
01:07:19,097 --> 01:07:22,100
But I like that we're sitting right now.
I like to sit.

1413
01:07:22,559 --> 01:07:25,937
That's true, Los Angeles
does have sitting going for it.

1414
01:07:26,312 --> 01:07:28,897
I think that's why
I like Los Angeles better.

1415
01:07:28,982 --> 01:07:30,066
Because you get to sit?

1416
01:07:30,149 --> 01:07:32,234
And because I like my friends here better.

1417
01:07:32,402 --> 01:07:33,528
That's not true.

1418
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:36,697
What about Horatio and Poppy?

1419
01:07:36,781 --> 01:07:38,783
Horatio doesn't like me anymore.

1420
01:07:39,242 --> 01:07:40,618
And I don't like Poppy.

1421
01:07:41,035 --> 01:07:42,411
Here, I have Axel.

1422
01:07:42,495 --> 01:07:45,247
Axel's hilarious.
I think you'd like him, Dad.

1423
01:07:46,249 --> 01:07:47,625
And my family's here.

1424
01:07:48,835 --> 01:07:49,794
Besides you.

1425
01:08:17,864 --> 01:08:19,031
Everyone's asleep.

1426
01:09:10,583 --> 01:09:11,584
I need to pee!

1427
01:09:18,299 --> 01:09:19,717
Who gave you a lighter?

1428
01:09:22,845 --> 01:09:23,846
Lift the seat.

1429
01:09:30,228 --> 01:09:32,313
I'm going to have to go back to New York
on Monday.

1430
01:09:32,814 --> 01:09:33,856
Did you flush?

1431
01:09:40,613 --> 01:09:41,572
Wash your hands.

1432
01:09:43,324 --> 01:09:44,867
Will you play with me?

1433
01:09:45,868 --> 01:09:47,369
I'm tired, honey.

1434
01:09:59,757 --> 01:10:01,842
Did you hear me?
I have to go back to New York.

1435
01:10:01,926 --> 01:10:04,053
Watch out!
Whoosh! I'm falling!

1436
01:10:06,556 --> 01:10:09,392
You didn't catch me.

1437
01:10:12,311 --> 01:10:13,145
Okay?

1438
01:10:14,147 --> 01:10:15,398
Why aren't you here more?

1439
01:10:16,983 --> 01:10:19,151
I have to work.

1440
01:10:19,235 --> 01:10:21,445
You know my play is opening on Broadway.

1441
01:10:21,946 --> 01:10:23,948
Is it because you don't want to be
near Mom?

1442
01:10:24,031 --> 01:10:26,116
No. You know, like we talked about,

1443
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:28,744
we both decided not to be together
no matter where we are,

1444
01:10:28,828 --> 01:10:30,454
but we both want to be with you.

1445
01:10:31,289 --> 01:10:33,666
But you're not near me
if you're in New York.

1446
01:10:34,208 --> 01:10:36,043
Well, we all still live in New York.

1447
01:10:36,711 --> 01:10:38,546
Yeah, but I go to school here.

1448
01:10:39,213 --> 01:10:40,255
Just for right now.

1449
01:10:41,174 --> 01:10:43,551
Like that time we were in Copenhagen
for my play.

1450
01:10:43,634 --> 01:10:46,053
Remember all those kids in buckets?

1451
01:10:46,137 --> 01:10:47,346
I like my school here,

1452
01:10:47,430 --> 01:10:49,932
and Mom says we could stay here
if we want.

1453
01:10:51,851 --> 01:10:52,726
What do you mean?

1454
01:10:54,896 --> 01:10:56,063
She said that?

1455
01:10:56,147 --> 01:10:56,981
Yeah.

1456
01:11:03,613 --> 01:11:04,780
Vroom.

1457
01:11:06,866 --> 01:11:07,908
Aah!

1458
01:11:24,675 --> 01:11:27,594
- Hello?
- Are you moving out here?

1459
01:11:28,304 --> 01:11:31,015
- Did you find a lawyer?
- Yes. Henry says you're moving here.

1460
01:11:31,098 --> 01:11:32,349
Have your lawyer call Nora.

1461
01:11:32,433 --> 01:11:33,767
I want to talk about it as us.

1462
01:11:33,851 --> 01:11:34,852
Who the fuck is "us"?

1463
01:11:34,936 --> 01:11:37,021
Let's just get in a room, you and me.

1464
01:11:37,104 --> 01:11:38,647
That's what we always said we'd do.

1465
01:11:38,731 --> 01:11:41,066
-My lawyers wouldn't let me sign anything.
-It's our divorce.

1466
01:11:41,150 --> 01:11:43,360
They say I could later sue them
for malpractice.

1467
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:45,696
What am I walking into?

1468
01:11:45,780 --> 01:11:47,156
What are you walking into?

1469
01:11:47,240 --> 01:11:48,866
Yes, what the fuck is going on?

1470
01:11:48,950 --> 01:11:52,578
I read your fucking e-mails, Charlie!
I read them all.

1471
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:54,746
- When?
- I don't know, recently.

1472
01:11:54,831 --> 01:11:56,332
- Shit.
- You're a fucking liar.

1473
01:11:56,415 --> 01:11:59,084
-You fucked Mary Ann!
-It was after I was sleeping on the couch.

1474
01:11:59,168 --> 01:12:00,836
All this bullshit about working on us.

1475
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:02,796
You know what? I have been working.

1476
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:04,548
I've been doing the work alone.

1477
01:12:04,632 --> 01:12:05,966
How did you read my e-mails?

1478
01:12:06,050 --> 01:12:08,427
I hacked into your account, you dumb fuck!

1479
01:12:08,511 --> 01:12:09,845
I think that's illegal!

1480
01:12:09,929 --> 01:12:12,306
Don't give me this shit
about being surprised about LA.

1481
01:12:12,390 --> 01:12:14,058
Surprise! I have my own opinions.

1482
01:12:14,141 --> 01:12:16,309
How do you even know
how to do something like that?

1483
01:12:16,394 --> 01:12:18,229
Surprise! I want things
that aren't what you want,

1484
01:12:18,312 --> 01:12:20,480
because, surprise,
you were fucking another lady.

1485
01:12:20,565 --> 01:12:23,442
It was one time! I think you're conflating
two different things.

1486
01:12:23,526 --> 01:12:25,027
Mary Ann has nothing to do with LA.

1487
01:12:25,111 --> 01:12:26,821
I am conflating, motherfucker!

1488
01:12:26,904 --> 01:12:28,322
You watch me conflate!

1489
01:12:32,660 --> 01:12:34,244
Did you just stamp your foot?

1490
01:12:34,704 --> 01:12:37,498
I don't think I've ever done that before.
I'm just so angry.

1491
01:12:39,834 --> 01:12:42,753
- You look like you needed one.
- Yes, I do, thanks.

1492
01:12:43,796 --> 01:12:46,799
You know, the Japanese are making
really interesting tequila right now.

1493
01:12:47,508 --> 01:12:48,759
That's exciting, I guess.

1494
01:12:50,011 --> 01:12:52,638
-What are you so angry about?
-My fucking ex-husband.

1495
01:12:53,180 --> 01:12:56,516
I spent all this time feeling guilty,
and he's so self-absorbed.

1496
01:12:56,601 --> 01:12:57,602
It's pointless.

1497
01:12:58,060 --> 01:12:59,936
It's a game I'm playing with myself.

1498
01:13:01,105 --> 01:13:04,149
Hey, Pablo. We met at —

1499
01:13:04,233 --> 01:13:06,276
-You held the bounce board.
-The flirty grip.

1500
01:13:09,906 --> 01:13:12,325
-Here's what I want you to only do, okay?
-What?

1501
01:13:12,491 --> 01:13:14,659
-I want you to finger me.
-What?

1502
01:13:14,744 --> 01:13:16,620
-Just finger me.
-Okay.

1503
01:13:16,704 --> 01:13:19,540
That's all we're going to do,
just fingering. Okay?

1504
01:13:20,166 --> 01:13:21,917
I'm changing my whole fucking life.

1505
01:13:28,007 --> 01:13:31,593
Nicole and Charlie's son, Henry,
was born here in Los Angeles.

1506
01:13:31,677 --> 01:13:34,846
He currently attends Laurel Elementary
in Laurel Canyon,

1507
01:13:34,931 --> 01:13:36,766
and Nicole works in Hollywood

1508
01:13:36,849 --> 01:13:39,601
while also maintaining a full schedule
as a mother

1509
01:13:39,685 --> 01:13:42,646
with classes of swim, art,

1510
01:13:42,730 --> 01:13:45,524
gym, and music, as well as play groups.

1511
01:13:46,442 --> 01:13:49,528
Nicole is Henry's
primary custodial parent,

1512
01:13:49,612 --> 01:13:54,033
and to the extent that Charlie
would like to exercise his custodial time,

1513
01:13:54,116 --> 01:13:57,410
he should be making efforts
to visit Henry here in California.

1514
01:13:57,495 --> 01:13:59,288
Nora, you seem to be ignoring the fact

1515
01:13:59,372 --> 01:14:02,666
that they lived in New York for ten years.

1516
01:14:02,750 --> 01:14:06,086
My client worked in New York
for several years, that's true.

1517
01:14:06,170 --> 01:14:08,463
But Nicole was born and bred
right here in LA.

1518
01:14:09,006 --> 01:14:12,217
She and Charlie would come here
most holidays and summers

1519
01:14:12,301 --> 01:14:13,593
to spend time with her family,

1520
01:14:13,678 --> 01:14:15,137
who all live in LA.

1521
01:14:15,638 --> 01:14:17,598
She and Charlie were married in LA.

1522
01:14:18,391 --> 01:14:19,683
Would you like to see the photos?

1523
01:14:19,767 --> 01:14:21,685
No, I don't need to see the photos.

1524
01:14:22,144 --> 01:14:24,271
Although I'm sure
they both look beautiful.

1525
01:14:25,481 --> 01:14:27,649
It's my client's expectation

1526
01:14:27,733 --> 01:14:30,235
that after this TV show is completed,

1527
01:14:30,319 --> 01:14:32,321
the parties will move back to New York

1528
01:14:32,405 --> 01:14:34,198
where they currently keep an apartment.

1529
01:14:34,281 --> 01:14:37,409
And it's my understanding
that Charlie promised Nicole

1530
01:14:37,493 --> 01:14:40,787
that they would spend more time
in Los Angeles during the marriage.

1531
01:14:40,871 --> 01:14:43,790
But because of his insistence
that his work keep them in New York,

1532
01:14:43,874 --> 01:14:47,836
Nicole ended up staying there much longer
than she ever anticipated.

1533
01:14:49,380 --> 01:14:51,340
In fact, a few years ago,

1534
01:14:51,424 --> 01:14:54,802
Charlie was offered a residency
at the Geffen Playhouse

1535
01:14:54,885 --> 01:14:57,554
that would have taken his work
and his family

1536
01:14:57,972 --> 01:14:59,974
to Los Angeles for a year.

1537
01:15:00,725 --> 01:15:02,435
And he, um...

1538
01:15:02,518 --> 01:15:03,560
turned it down.

1539
01:15:04,103 --> 01:15:06,105
Even though that was Nicole's desire.

1540
01:15:06,188 --> 01:15:10,317
He wanted to maintain consistency
for his family and his child.

1541
01:15:10,401 --> 01:15:12,486
Was this the same consistency
he wanted to maintain

1542
01:15:12,570 --> 01:15:16,073
when they went to Copenhagen
for six months so he could direct a play?

1543
01:15:16,157 --> 01:15:19,243
Now, while I understand
Charlie lives in New York...

1544
01:15:19,827 --> 01:15:23,622
and when it's convenient to his work
schedule, he flies out to see his son...

1545
01:15:23,706 --> 01:15:26,166
He flies out here every chance he gets,
at great expense.

1546
01:15:26,250 --> 01:15:28,502
I don't see any reason
you can't be out here full time.

1547
01:15:28,586 --> 01:15:30,045
He makes his living in New York.

1548
01:15:30,129 --> 01:15:32,673
-Sorry, do we want to contemplate lunch?
-Good idea.

1549
01:15:32,757 --> 01:15:34,759
I'll order now so it'll come
when we're all hungry.

1550
01:15:34,842 --> 01:15:35,801
Yeah.

1551
01:15:35,885 --> 01:15:37,928
- Everyone good with Manny's?
- I'd love Manny's.

1552
01:15:39,055 --> 01:15:40,181
Have you had Manny's?

1553
01:15:41,098 --> 01:15:44,684
You'll love it.
Just really yummy sandwiches and salads.

1554
01:15:44,769 --> 01:15:46,228
I'll have the BLT.

1555
01:15:46,312 --> 01:15:47,187
Dad?

1556
01:15:47,938 --> 01:15:49,064
Turkey.

1557
01:15:49,148 --> 01:15:50,440
I'll have the BLT.

1558
01:15:50,775 --> 01:15:52,485
-You'll have the kale?
-Kale salad.

1559
01:16:10,461 --> 01:16:11,587
I don't know, sorry.

1560
01:16:13,756 --> 01:16:15,257
Charlie will have, um...

1561
01:16:17,176 --> 01:16:18,135
the Greek salad,

1562
01:16:18,594 --> 01:16:21,346
but with lemon and olive oil
instead of the Greek dressing.

1563
01:16:21,430 --> 01:16:22,264
Okay.

1564
01:16:22,348 --> 01:16:24,767
- I'll have the Chinese chicken salad.
- Okay, sure.

1565
01:16:24,850 --> 01:16:26,017
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

1566
01:16:29,396 --> 01:16:32,399
Congratulations, Charlie, on your grant.
Nicole told me.

1567
01:16:32,483 --> 01:16:33,484
Thank you.

1568
01:16:33,567 --> 01:16:34,901
He's a genius.

1569
01:16:36,237 --> 01:16:39,073
Well, I told Nicole
I loved your play.

1570
01:16:39,156 --> 01:16:41,158
- Really.
- Thanks.

1571
01:16:41,242 --> 01:16:43,160
You are one smart cookie.

1572
01:16:44,328 --> 01:16:45,370
Thanks.

1573
01:16:45,454 --> 01:16:47,831
I would just love to...

1574
01:16:47,915 --> 01:16:50,125
Crawl inside that brain.

1575
01:16:50,668 --> 01:16:54,838
There was that one moment
when you smell the toast, smell.

1576
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:58,717
It was literally my favorite thing
that I saw that year.

1577
01:16:58,801 --> 01:17:01,261
- Thanks.
- Truly genius.

1578
01:17:01,345 --> 01:17:02,179
Thank you.

1579
01:17:02,972 --> 01:17:05,391
I was sorry to hear it closed on Broadway.

1580
01:17:05,474 --> 01:17:07,100
They couldn't smell the toast.

1581
01:17:08,352 --> 01:17:09,853
It was so emotional.

1582
01:17:10,312 --> 01:17:11,187
Laughs]

1583
01:17:11,272 --> 01:17:13,482
It's very competitive, I imagine.

1584
01:17:14,775 --> 01:17:18,361
Now, when Charlie is in Los Angeles,

1585
01:17:18,445 --> 01:17:21,823
Nicole, of course, agrees
that it will be best for Henry

1586
01:17:22,283 --> 01:17:24,618
that he see each parent equally.

1587
01:17:26,412 --> 01:17:30,207
It's very nice out here, Charlie.
You should give it a chance.

1588
01:17:30,291 --> 01:17:32,751
Yeah, and the space... you can't beat it.

1589
01:17:32,835 --> 01:17:33,877
I love it too.

1590
01:17:34,795 --> 01:17:38,006
But all of our personal feelings
about the two cities aside,

1591
01:17:38,090 --> 01:17:42,302
we don't share your assertion
that the couple is an LA-based family.

1592
01:17:42,386 --> 01:17:44,679
It was very clearly their deal

1593
01:17:44,763 --> 01:17:48,057
that they would go back to New York
after Nicole finished her show.

1594
01:17:48,142 --> 01:17:49,685
I'm not aware of any deal.

1595
01:17:50,477 --> 01:17:52,187
Well, I didn't get it in writing.

1596
01:17:55,107 --> 01:17:58,068
Charlie, is this like the deal
that you made

1597
01:17:58,152 --> 01:18:01,738
that you and Nicole would spend more time
in LA during your marriage?

1598
01:18:01,822 --> 01:18:04,574
We didn't have a deal.
It was something we discussed.

1599
01:18:04,658 --> 01:18:05,742
But...

1600
01:18:05,826 --> 01:18:08,829
So, it's a deal
when it's something you want

1601
01:18:08,913 --> 01:18:10,915
and a discussion when Nicole wants it?

1602
01:18:14,210 --> 01:18:15,044
Sidebar...

1603
01:18:16,170 --> 01:18:19,089
Nora, do you have a spare office
where Charlie and I can sidebar?

1604
01:18:19,173 --> 01:18:20,007
Sure.

1605
01:18:20,090 --> 01:18:22,050
-Can you, um...
-I can show you.

1606
01:18:22,551 --> 01:18:23,385
Come on.

1607
01:18:29,391 --> 01:18:32,435
Nora is a very good lawyer.

1608
01:18:33,479 --> 01:18:34,813
-Tough, right?
-Yeah.

1609
01:18:35,397 --> 01:18:38,233
And you're in a bind because you've shown
you're willing to fly out here

1610
01:18:38,317 --> 01:18:40,110
and rent an apartment to see your son.

1611
01:18:40,194 --> 01:18:41,904
-You told me to do that.
-I know that.

1612
01:18:41,987 --> 01:18:45,281
And I'm doing that because I want
to see my kid, not to set a precedent.

1613
01:18:45,366 --> 01:18:47,951
Yes, but unfortunately,
you are setting a precedent.

1614
01:18:48,744 --> 01:18:50,370
And a judge might look at it that way.

1615
01:18:50,454 --> 01:18:53,665
What's the alternative? I stay in New York
and never come out here?

1616
01:18:53,749 --> 01:18:55,751
No, because then it would look
to the court

1617
01:18:55,834 --> 01:18:57,710
like you don't care about seeing your son.

1618
01:18:57,795 --> 01:19:00,964
Court or no court? Stop saying "court"
and then "never court."

1619
01:19:01,048 --> 01:19:03,800
Well, the way this is going,
we may have to go to court.

1620
01:19:04,426 --> 01:19:07,095
-Are you aware of how maddening you sound?
-I am.

1621
01:19:08,430 --> 01:19:10,223
And I know it seems unfair.

1622
01:19:13,936 --> 01:19:15,270
But imagine if you were...

1623
01:19:16,313 --> 01:19:19,232
a poor mother whose husband abandons her,

1624
01:19:19,316 --> 01:19:21,026
and then refuses to pay anything.

1625
01:19:22,778 --> 01:19:25,572
That's what the system
is trying to protect people from.

1626
01:19:27,825 --> 01:19:28,659
Listen...

1627
01:19:29,576 --> 01:19:30,952
if I were representing you —

1628
01:19:31,036 --> 01:19:32,203
You are representing me.

1629
01:19:32,288 --> 01:19:33,789
Right, no, of course. No...

1630
01:19:34,581 --> 01:19:38,501
I don't see a judge
moving this child from California.

1631
01:19:38,585 --> 01:19:40,378
I think we try and settle today.

1632
01:19:40,796 --> 01:19:42,756
Settle meaning what?

1633
01:19:43,549 --> 01:19:44,508
She gets LA.

1634
01:19:44,591 --> 01:19:46,009
No, Bert, just...

1635
01:19:47,177 --> 01:19:48,219
No.

1636
01:19:48,304 --> 01:19:50,180
I mean, we have to win this.

1637
01:19:50,264 --> 01:19:52,975
Remember, the win
is what's best for Henry.

1638
01:19:53,058 --> 01:19:55,477
And if you guys go to court,
he's going to get pulled into it.

1639
01:19:55,561 --> 01:19:58,605
But if he stays here
and I stay in New York, that's just...

1640
01:19:58,981 --> 01:20:00,107
then I won't...

1641
01:20:00,733 --> 01:20:02,735
I'll never get to really be
his parent again.

1642
01:20:02,818 --> 01:20:03,652
It'll be different.

1643
01:20:03,736 --> 01:20:04,737
It won't exist.

1644
01:20:05,195 --> 01:20:06,738
So maybe you move here.

1645
01:20:07,364 --> 01:20:08,948
You heard what Amir said about the space.

1646
01:20:09,033 --> 01:20:11,660
Fuck the space, Bert! Fuck the space!

1647
01:20:11,744 --> 01:20:15,122
I'll do whatever you want me to do,
but this is my advice.

1648
01:20:15,205 --> 01:20:17,457
I've seen these things go on and on,

1649
01:20:17,541 --> 01:20:20,377
and the burden of these battles
is immeasurable.

1650
01:20:20,461 --> 01:20:24,506
I had a client get colon cancer and die
before he and his wife came to agreement.

1651
01:20:24,590 --> 01:20:26,049
What about filing in New York?

1652
01:20:26,133 --> 01:20:27,467
It's too late.

1653
01:20:27,551 --> 01:20:29,511
And even if you did,
I don't think it would matter.

1654
01:20:29,595 --> 01:20:31,430
They're being reasonable financially,
you know?

1655
01:20:31,513 --> 01:20:34,182
You're — You're lucky they didn't ask
for half your grant money.

1656
01:20:34,266 --> 01:20:36,977
She wouldn't do that. She knows
I put all that money back in my theater.

1657
01:20:37,061 --> 01:20:38,645
If this continues, she might.

1658
01:20:39,104 --> 01:20:41,356
The actors and crew
all rely on that money.

1659
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:43,316
The court would never agree
with this, right?

1660
01:20:43,400 --> 01:20:46,361
Whether they do or not,
it'll cost you half your grant money

1661
01:20:46,445 --> 01:20:47,904
to go to court and prove it.

1662
01:20:50,824 --> 01:20:51,991
I feel like a criminal.

1663
01:20:52,951 --> 01:20:54,577
But you didn't commit any crime.

1664
01:20:54,661 --> 01:20:55,995
It doesn't feel that way.

1665
01:20:56,080 --> 01:20:58,499
If we give on LA right now,

1666
01:20:58,582 --> 01:21:00,417
and then try to make
the best deal possible,

1667
01:21:00,501 --> 01:21:02,544
I think we can get her
to give on other fronts.

1668
01:21:02,628 --> 01:21:04,546
There are no other fronts!

1669
01:21:05,506 --> 01:21:06,673
This is the thing!

1670
01:21:07,341 --> 01:21:09,468
He needs to know that I fought for him!

1671
01:21:09,551 --> 01:21:10,385
He'll know.

1672
01:21:25,025 --> 01:21:27,694
I should never have
let her come out here with Henry.

1673
01:21:27,778 --> 01:21:30,197
If it wasn't LA and New York,
it'd be something else.

1674
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:33,700
You'd be fighting about a house,
or a school district, or...

1675
01:21:35,119 --> 01:21:36,245
You know what this is like?

1676
01:21:36,328 --> 01:21:40,332
This is like that joke about the woman
at the hairdresser, she's going to Rome.

1677
01:21:40,416 --> 01:21:42,292
-Do you know this?
-I don't.

1678
01:21:42,376 --> 01:21:44,294
This woman is at her hairdresser
and she says,

1679
01:21:44,378 --> 01:21:45,754
"I'm going to Rome on holiday."

1680
01:21:45,838 --> 01:21:48,340
And he says, "Really?
What... what airline are you taking?"

1681
01:21:48,424 --> 01:21:49,967
She says, "Alitalia."

1682
01:21:50,050 --> 01:21:52,177
He says, "Alitalia? Are you crazy?

1683
01:21:52,261 --> 01:21:54,513
That's the worst...
That's terrible. Don't take that."

1684
01:21:54,596 --> 01:21:56,139
He says, "Where are you going to stay?"

1685
01:21:56,223 --> 01:21:57,933
She says, "I'm going to stay
at the Hassler."

1686
01:21:58,016 --> 01:22:00,268
"The Hassler? What, are you kidding?

1687
01:22:00,352 --> 01:22:03,313
They're renovating the Hassler.
You'll hear hammering all night long.

1688
01:22:03,397 --> 01:22:05,148
You won't sleep.
What are you going to see?"

1689
01:22:05,232 --> 01:22:07,609
She says, "I think I'm going to try
to go to the Vatican."

1690
01:22:07,693 --> 01:22:10,112
"The Vatican?
You'll be standing in line all day long.

1691
01:22:10,195 --> 01:22:11,613
You'll never get to see anything —"

1692
01:22:11,697 --> 01:22:13,907
I'm sorry, Bert,
am I paying for this joke?

1693
01:22:16,118 --> 01:22:18,703
Whatever happens here, it's temporary.

1694
01:22:19,246 --> 01:22:22,249
He's growing up. He's going to have
opinions on the subject.

1695
01:22:22,708 --> 01:22:24,584
Time is on your side, Charlie.

1696
01:22:26,336 --> 01:22:28,504
Maybe he'll do college on the East Coast.

1697
01:22:37,181 --> 01:22:41,518
I have most of my coins,
like my quarters and dimes, at Daddy's...

1698
01:22:41,602 --> 01:22:43,562
- Right.
- ...but I'm keeping my dollars

1699
01:22:43,645 --> 01:22:45,772
and my one twenty at yours, okay?

1700
01:22:46,398 --> 01:22:50,652
So, that is one twenty plus 50,
what is that?

1701
01:22:50,736 --> 01:22:51,862
Goddamn it.

1702
01:22:52,321 --> 01:22:53,363
What's "Goddamn it"?

1703
01:22:53,447 --> 01:22:55,323
Did you guys lose power where you are?

1704
01:22:55,407 --> 01:22:57,534
Dad? Did we lose power?

1705
01:22:58,035 --> 01:22:58,869
No.

1706
01:22:59,495 --> 01:23:02,372
There is rolling blackouts
in the hills and no w...

1707
01:23:02,956 --> 01:23:05,416
Damn it.
Now the gate won't close.

1708
01:23:05,501 --> 01:23:07,002
Her gate won't close.

1709
01:23:12,549 --> 01:23:13,383
Morn!

1710
01:23:13,884 --> 01:23:14,718
Hey.

1711
01:23:17,387 --> 01:23:19,597
- Can we go see my room?
- Yeah, of course.

1712
01:23:19,681 --> 01:23:21,349
-You tried all the —
-I tried everything.

1713
01:23:21,433 --> 01:23:23,143
Sorry I made you come out.

1714
01:23:23,227 --> 01:23:24,061
It's fine.

1715
01:23:24,186 --> 01:23:26,188
-I just —
-You don't want your gate open.

1716
01:23:26,355 --> 01:23:27,189
Right.

1717
01:23:27,606 --> 01:23:31,026
-There should be a panel or something —
-Maybe this is something here.

1718
01:23:33,237 --> 01:23:34,571
- It's a cute house.
- Yeah.

1719
01:23:34,655 --> 01:23:36,406
I mean, from what I can see.

1720
01:23:36,490 --> 01:23:37,324
Thanks.

1721
01:23:41,286 --> 01:23:42,412
You're getting shaggy.

1722
01:23:42,496 --> 01:23:45,123
Yeah, I have to find a hair cutter.

1723
01:23:46,667 --> 01:23:48,085
You want me to cut it?

1724
01:23:48,710 --> 01:23:49,669
Okay.

1725
01:24:00,597 --> 01:24:01,639
Close your eyes.

1726
01:24:06,728 --> 01:24:07,979
He's out.

1727
01:24:08,063 --> 01:24:09,731
Maybe he should stay here tonight.

1728
01:24:11,024 --> 01:24:11,858
It's my night.

1729
01:24:41,179 --> 01:24:43,764
Hey, come on. We're going.
Come on. Let's take a walk. Right?

1730
01:24:43,849 --> 01:24:44,933
Yeah, we're going to take a walk.

1731
01:24:45,017 --> 01:24:47,227
-We're taking a walk.
-Fine, all right. She's crazy.

1732
01:24:47,311 --> 01:24:48,687
We're mostly finished.

1733
01:24:49,313 --> 01:24:51,857
Bert and I hammered out
90 percent of the details,

1734
01:24:51,940 --> 01:24:55,068
and there's a couple minor things hanging,

1735
01:24:55,152 --> 01:24:56,236
but it should be easy.

1736
01:24:57,195 --> 01:24:59,739
And then the judge
makes your divorce official.

1737
01:25:00,449 --> 01:25:01,533
That's good.

1738
01:25:04,369 --> 01:25:06,329
- Fuck me.
- What?

1739
01:25:06,413 --> 01:25:08,289
Who's that?

1740
01:25:08,373 --> 01:25:11,125
Charlie shouldn't have done this.

1741
01:25:11,209 --> 01:25:12,793
What do you mean? Where's Bert?

1742
01:25:12,878 --> 01:25:16,506
This means that everything
we've agreed upon now is off the table.

1743
01:25:16,923 --> 01:25:18,007
We've got LA, right?

1744
01:25:18,091 --> 01:25:20,134
Not with Jay Marotta representing him.

1745
01:25:20,719 --> 01:25:22,178
This is a street fight now.

1746
01:25:22,262 --> 01:25:25,807
And I'm going to have to ask for things
that we wouldn't normally ask for.

1747
01:25:26,391 --> 01:25:28,893
This system rewards bad behavior.

1748
01:25:30,562 --> 01:25:31,521
.Jay-
- Hey!

1749
01:25:31,605 --> 01:25:32,480
Hi.

1750
01:25:32,731 --> 01:25:34,899
I saw Miriam at Madeo the other night.

1751
01:25:34,983 --> 01:25:36,442
-Yeah?
-Looking very handsome.

1752
01:25:36,526 --> 01:25:39,529
You know, you should come
to our Stand Up To Cancer event.

1753
01:25:39,613 --> 01:25:41,865
- John Legend's going to play.
- Love him.

1754
01:25:41,948 --> 01:25:43,991
Okay? It's going to be
at the Beverly Hilton, I think.

1755
01:25:44,076 --> 01:25:45,077
- Great.
- Okay?

1756
01:25:45,160 --> 01:25:46,870
She said you're spending
more time in Malibu.

1757
01:25:46,953 --> 01:25:48,496
- Really?
- Me too.

1758
01:25:48,580 --> 01:25:50,540
I haven't seen her
since that building was ICM.

1759
01:25:51,583 --> 01:25:52,792
A little history...

1760
01:25:54,294 --> 01:25:56,504
Ten years ago, Charlie takes a risk

1761
01:25:56,588 --> 01:26:01,088
when he first hires Nicole as an actress
in his play in New York City.

1762
01:26:02,052 --> 01:26:04,596
He's a well-regarded
up-and-coming director

1763
01:26:04,680 --> 01:26:06,139
of the avant-garde.

1764
01:26:06,431 --> 01:26:09,642
And she's known
as the girl in that college sex movie

1765
01:26:09,726 --> 01:26:11,811
who takes her top off.

1766
01:26:11,895 --> 01:26:13,938
-My client will not be slut-shamed...
-Ten years on...

1767
01:26:14,022 --> 01:26:15,189
...for an artistic choice.

1768
01:26:15,273 --> 01:26:17,650
...and many prestigious
theater roles later...

1769
01:26:18,110 --> 01:26:20,695
she becomes an actress
of great credibility.

1770
01:26:20,779 --> 01:26:23,072
And it's because of that credibility,

1771
01:26:23,365 --> 01:26:27,202
that she's offered the lead role
in a major television show.

1772
01:26:27,285 --> 01:26:30,705
This new opportunity is thanks to Charlie.

1773
01:26:30,789 --> 01:26:34,751
Your Honor, we shouldn't have to pay
support money at this point.

1774
01:26:35,669 --> 01:26:39,422
In fact, Charlie is entitled
to half her TV money,

1775
01:26:39,965 --> 01:26:42,509
present and future earnings of the show.

1776
01:26:45,095 --> 01:26:49,140
Charlie's just received
the enormous sum of $650,000

1777
01:26:49,224 --> 01:26:50,683
in the form of a MacArthur grant.

1778
01:26:50,767 --> 01:26:52,769
-Of which he gets...
-This is for the theater work...

1779
01:26:52,853 --> 01:26:55,522
-...he conducted during the marriage.
-...in 125,000 installments

1780
01:26:55,605 --> 01:26:56,856
...over five years.

1781
01:26:56,940 --> 01:26:59,275
-So by Jay's same logic, this is work...
-He uses the money...

1782
01:26:59,359 --> 01:27:01,903
-...that Nicole contributed to.
-to employ actors and crew members...

1783
01:27:01,987 --> 01:27:04,781
-One at a time, please.
-...and to pay debts that he's accumulated

1784
01:27:04,865 --> 01:27:07,576
with his theater company
that stars his wife.

1785
01:27:10,412 --> 01:27:12,705
- Bless you.
- Not only did she turn down

1786
01:27:12,789 --> 01:27:14,749
a lucrative and successful career
in movies

1787
01:27:14,833 --> 01:27:17,126
to perform in his little theater,

1788
01:27:17,878 --> 01:27:21,715
but she actually supplied Charlie
with a loan early on to help out.

1789
01:27:21,798 --> 01:27:24,300
-Which he paid back.
-She lent her name to the marquee,

1790
01:27:24,384 --> 01:27:26,803
which was the principle reason
people came to the theater.

1791
01:27:26,887 --> 01:27:28,430
That may have been true ten years ago.

1792
01:27:28,513 --> 01:27:32,683
And in turn,
she helped establish Charlie's reputation.

1793
01:27:33,310 --> 01:27:34,728
Now, over the next ten years,

1794
01:27:34,811 --> 01:27:37,897
she was subsequently offered parts
in movies, TV shows,

1795
01:27:38,023 --> 01:27:40,316
most of which she turned down
at Charlie's behest

1796
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:43,069
to be a mom and act in his plays.

1797
01:27:43,653 --> 01:27:47,698
So, while we are willing to be flexible
on support,

1798
01:27:47,783 --> 01:27:51,495
we contend that half of Charlie's
grant money be split between the parties.

1799
01:27:51,578 --> 01:27:54,038
I don't see how you can claim
that she gets half a grant

1800
01:27:54,122 --> 01:27:56,082
dedicated to his genius.

1801
01:27:56,166 --> 01:27:57,667
He became a genius during the marriage.

1802
01:27:57,751 --> 01:27:58,752
Come on, Nora.

1803
01:27:58,835 --> 01:28:01,504
Charlie himself, upon hearing
that he received the prize,

1804
01:28:01,588 --> 01:28:03,881
told Nicole that it belonged to her too.

1805
01:28:04,257 --> 01:28:06,384
That's what people say
when they win awards.

1806
01:28:06,468 --> 01:28:09,429
No, he was implying what was true.

1807
01:28:10,138 --> 01:28:13,599
His genius was an intangible asset
built during the marriage.

1808
01:28:13,683 --> 01:28:16,727
Nora, I like how you refer
to Charlie's theater

1809
01:28:16,812 --> 01:28:19,231
as a ramshackle downtown dump

1810
01:28:19,314 --> 01:28:20,982
when you're arguing custody,

1811
01:28:21,066 --> 01:28:23,151
but when you want more money,

1812
01:28:23,235 --> 01:28:25,737
he's a big, rich, genius
Broadway director.

1813
01:28:25,821 --> 01:28:27,155
You can't have it both ways.

1814
01:28:27,239 --> 01:28:28,240
Really? Why not?

1815
01:28:28,740 --> 01:28:30,950
And whether you think
it's fair or not, Jay,

1816
01:28:31,660 --> 01:28:34,079
the first monetary installment
from the MacArthur grant

1817
01:28:34,162 --> 01:28:36,914
was put into a joint marital account,
and thus became communal property.

1818
01:28:36,998 --> 01:28:39,625
Fuck. You shouldn't have put
that money in a joint account.

1819
01:28:39,709 --> 01:28:42,712
There's not going to be anything left,
anyway. I'm using it all to divorce her.

1820
01:28:42,796 --> 01:28:45,381
Nora, I have to say
that your account of this marriage

1821
01:28:45,465 --> 01:28:48,050
takes place in an alternate reality.

1822
01:28:48,635 --> 01:28:53,135
By suddenly moving to LA
and insisting on an LA residence,

1823
01:28:54,182 --> 01:28:56,392
Nicole is withholding Henry...

1824
01:28:56,476 --> 01:28:59,145
- Counsel, please be seated.
- ...alienating him from his father,

1825
01:28:59,229 --> 01:29:02,190
which has turned Charlie's world
upside down.

1826
01:29:02,274 --> 01:29:03,942
- Counselor?
- It amounts to an ambush.

1827
01:29:04,025 --> 01:29:06,193
"Withholding," Jay? Really? "Alienating"?

1828
01:29:06,570 --> 01:29:07,904
Well, those are fighting words,

1829
01:29:07,988 --> 01:29:11,074
and it's simply false and does nothing
to further this settlement.

1830
01:29:12,242 --> 01:29:15,119
Your recap of this situation
is outrageous.

1831
01:29:15,203 --> 01:29:18,206
And although California is,
without doubt, a no-fault state,

1832
01:29:18,290 --> 01:29:21,459
it bears mentioning
in the accurate recap of this situation

1833
01:29:21,543 --> 01:29:23,461
that Charlie had had extramarital affairs.

1834
01:29:23,545 --> 01:29:26,130
-An extramarital affair.
-Do you really want me to go there?

1835
01:29:26,214 --> 01:29:28,382
- Yeah, let's go there.
- Okay.

1836
01:29:28,466 --> 01:29:31,343
Nicole has admitted
to hacking Charlie's computer

1837
01:29:31,428 --> 01:29:32,846
and reading his e-mails,

1838
01:29:32,929 --> 01:29:35,348
which, if proven, is a felony.

1839
01:29:35,682 --> 01:29:37,475
And, Nora,
I don't think you'd be too happy

1840
01:29:37,559 --> 01:29:40,937
if I ask Nicole about her alcohol
consumption in the evenings.

1841
01:29:41,021 --> 01:29:41,855
What?

1842
01:29:41,938 --> 01:29:44,523
She confided in Charlie
one night recently,

1843
01:29:44,608 --> 01:29:46,943
having just carried Henry to bed,

1844
01:29:47,027 --> 01:29:51,489
that she was having trouble standing
while walking down the staircase.

1845
01:29:52,073 --> 01:29:55,034
And from what I understand,
this is not an isolated event.

1846
01:29:55,118 --> 01:29:57,286
So you let me know, Nora,

1847
01:29:57,370 --> 01:29:59,705
-and we will go there as needed.
-Charlie?

1848
01:30:00,749 --> 01:30:01,750
Can I ask you,

1849
01:30:01,833 --> 01:30:03,835
how do you expect
to have more time with Henry

1850
01:30:03,919 --> 01:30:06,379
when you don't exercise the time
you already have,

1851
01:30:06,463 --> 01:30:08,756
and exercise it responsibly?

1852
01:30:09,299 --> 01:30:12,010
On a recent visit to Los Angeles,

1853
01:30:12,093 --> 01:30:14,720
after failing to call, text,

1854
01:30:14,804 --> 01:30:17,014
communicate in any way, shape, or form,

1855
01:30:17,265 --> 01:30:18,766
Charlie finally arrived two hours late

1856
01:30:18,850 --> 01:30:20,768
to pick up Henry
at Nicole's mother's house.

1857
01:30:20,852 --> 01:30:22,770
At that point, the car seat,

1858
01:30:22,854 --> 01:30:26,566
which he had assured Nicole
had been professionally installed,

1859
01:30:26,650 --> 01:30:28,068
was clearly not even belted in.

1860
01:30:28,151 --> 01:30:31,154
-It was just sitting in the back seat.
-You have to buckle in the car seat.

1861
01:30:31,237 --> 01:30:32,071
-It's the law.
-I know.

1862
01:30:32,155 --> 01:30:34,657
-I thought the rental place did it.
-They can't. It's a liability.

1863
01:30:34,741 --> 01:30:36,784
I know that now.
Once we discovered that, we fixed it.

1864
01:30:36,868 --> 01:30:37,785
Counsel?

1865
01:30:38,787 --> 01:30:40,330
You can see my courtroom is full

1866
01:30:40,413 --> 01:30:43,999
and there are people who don't have
the resources your clients have,

1867
01:30:44,376 --> 01:30:47,587
and I'm fairly certain
you haven't exhausted, in good faith,

1868
01:30:47,671 --> 01:30:49,964
the arguments in the case of this child.

1869
01:30:50,048 --> 01:30:52,592
In the meantime,
we'll keep the status quo.

1870
01:30:52,676 --> 01:30:56,471
This remains an LA family
for the time being.

1871
01:30:56,554 --> 01:30:58,847
I took over this department recently,

1872
01:30:59,432 --> 01:31:02,059
and I'm still becoming acquainted
with the cases.

1873
01:31:02,143 --> 01:31:06,147
So, I'm going to appoint
an expert evaluator

1874
01:31:06,606 --> 01:31:09,525
who knows much more about young children
than I do.

1875
01:31:10,193 --> 01:31:12,445
Once the evaluation is done,

1876
01:31:12,529 --> 01:31:15,323
we'll modify the orders where necessary.

1877
01:31:20,412 --> 01:31:21,454
Hey.

1878
01:31:22,122 --> 01:31:23,248
Hey, where's Henry?

1879
01:31:23,873 --> 01:31:26,000
He's with Cassie and her kids
at laser tag.

1880
01:31:27,127 --> 01:31:28,211
You want something to drink?

1881
01:31:28,294 --> 01:31:31,964
I have unfiltered tap water, beer,
and some juice boxes.

1882
01:31:32,298 --> 01:31:33,549
I'll take a juice box.

1883
01:31:39,597 --> 01:31:41,599
You don't have anything on the walls?

1884
01:31:41,683 --> 01:31:44,769
I don't have anything to put on them
except Henry's art, which is being framed.

1885
01:31:44,853 --> 01:31:48,606
I can give you some stuff,
you know, until you get some things.

1886
01:31:48,982 --> 01:31:52,318
How about that great picture of Henry
on the Staten Island Ferry?

1887
01:31:52,485 --> 01:31:53,652
Aren't you in that one?

1888
01:31:55,196 --> 01:31:58,157
-I guess I... You could... cut me out.
-I'm gonna have to leave a day early

1889
01:31:58,241 --> 01:31:59,450
to go to New York on the 22nd.

1890
01:31:59,534 --> 01:32:01,577
So I was wondering
if I could take Henry that Friday.

1891
01:32:01,661 --> 01:32:04,747
The 22nd. So, that's the 21st?

1892
01:32:05,331 --> 01:32:07,249
We have plans, actually.

1893
01:32:07,333 --> 01:32:10,377
We're going to, um, some thing at LACMA
with the cousins.

1894
01:32:10,962 --> 01:32:13,047
But could you change it
so I could take him?

1895
01:32:13,131 --> 01:32:14,799
It's just one night.

1896
01:32:14,883 --> 01:32:16,426
-He's looking forward to it.
-Really?

1897
01:32:17,177 --> 01:32:19,470
It's my night, Charlie, we negotiated it.

1898
01:32:19,554 --> 01:32:20,429
Okay, fine.

1899
01:32:21,639 --> 01:32:22,598
But what?

1900
01:32:22,682 --> 01:32:24,642
No, I'm just asking you to be flexible.

1901
01:32:24,726 --> 01:32:27,562
I am flexible. You come in and out
and I adjust based on your schedule.

1902
01:32:27,645 --> 01:32:30,981
-This one night we have tickets to —
-It's not only this one night, but fine.

1903
01:32:31,066 --> 01:32:34,235
-Henry's teacher wants to meet with us.
-You mean his LA teacher?

1904
01:32:34,319 --> 01:32:37,322
Can you, answer the e-mail
so we could set a time?

1905
01:32:37,697 --> 01:32:39,156
Yeah, I've been distracted.

1906
01:32:40,283 --> 01:32:41,742
I understand.

1907
01:32:41,826 --> 01:32:44,370
They just want to rule out everything,
you know, with his reading.

1908
01:32:44,454 --> 01:32:46,247
I just think he's a little overanxious.

1909
01:32:46,331 --> 01:32:47,957
I think he wants it too much.

1910
01:32:48,041 --> 01:32:49,959
They said he's off the charts in math.

1911
01:32:50,043 --> 01:32:52,378
He quits too easily
when things aren't easy for him.

1912
01:32:52,462 --> 01:32:54,130
You know, he's like us, he's stubborn.

1913
01:32:54,964 --> 01:32:58,217
He's still a lousy Monopoly player
because he tries to save all his money.

1914
01:32:58,301 --> 01:32:59,260
Laughs]

1915
01:32:59,928 --> 01:33:00,762
Laughs]

1916
01:33:03,723 --> 01:33:04,557
So...

1917
01:33:05,809 --> 01:33:08,436
I thought we should talk.

1918
01:33:08,520 --> 01:33:10,522
I feel like maybe things
have gone too far.

1919
01:33:11,523 --> 01:33:14,734
I mean, my mom's taking out a loan
against the house to help me pay Nora.

1920
01:33:14,818 --> 01:33:16,110
I thought I paid Nora.

1921
01:33:16,194 --> 01:33:17,778
You pay 30 percent of Nora.

1922
01:33:17,862 --> 01:33:20,698
Well, I'm going broke too,
if that's any help.

1923
01:33:20,782 --> 01:33:22,784
I've just agreed to direct
two shitty plays,

1924
01:33:22,867 --> 01:33:25,160
and we can forget putting anything away
for Henry's college.

1925
01:33:25,745 --> 01:33:29,039
It's just that up until now, we've been
able to keep Henry somewhat removed,

1926
01:33:29,124 --> 01:33:30,625
and this will change that.

1927
01:33:31,918 --> 01:33:32,919
We have to protect him.

1928
01:33:33,002 --> 01:33:33,836
I agree.

1929
01:33:33,920 --> 01:33:37,173
Nora says that the evaluator
will come into our homes,

1930
01:33:37,465 --> 01:33:40,134
they're going to interview Henry
in addition to us,

1931
01:33:40,218 --> 01:33:43,137
our friends, family, enemies,

1932
01:33:43,221 --> 01:33:46,515
and then they'll observe us with him,
how we are as parents.

1933
01:33:46,599 --> 01:33:48,183
- Sounds awful.
- I know.

1934
01:33:48,685 --> 01:33:52,438
I feel like if anybody observed me on any
given day as a mom, I'd never get custody.

1935
01:33:54,607 --> 01:33:55,482
That was a joke.

1936
01:33:56,025 --> 01:33:58,318
- I know. I feel the same way.
- Right.

1937
01:33:58,403 --> 01:33:59,320
So...

1938
01:34:00,780 --> 01:34:02,948
Maybe we can figure
something out between us.

1939
01:34:03,616 --> 01:34:05,492
You remember I said this to you
at the beginning?

1940
01:34:05,577 --> 01:34:07,870
I know you did,
but these are different circumstances.

1941
01:34:07,954 --> 01:34:09,789
I was anticipating these circumstances.

1942
01:34:10,623 --> 01:34:12,583
Anyway, shall we try this?

1943
01:34:12,667 --> 01:34:14,335
Okay.

1944
01:34:28,183 --> 01:34:29,184
I don't know how to start.

1945
01:34:31,728 --> 01:34:34,105
Do you understand
why I want to stay in LA?

1946
01:34:34,189 --> 01:34:35,023
No.

1947
01:34:35,106 --> 01:34:36,482
Well... That's not...

1948
01:34:36,566 --> 01:34:39,110
Charlie, that's not a useful way
for us to start.

1949
01:34:39,194 --> 01:34:40,320
I don't understand it.

1950
01:34:42,280 --> 01:34:45,074
You don't remember promising
that we could do time here?

1951
01:34:45,158 --> 01:34:46,159
We discussed things.

1952
01:34:46,618 --> 01:34:48,077
We were married, we said things.

1953
01:34:48,161 --> 01:34:49,829
We talked about moving to Europe.

1954
01:34:49,913 --> 01:34:51,122
About getting a...

1955
01:34:52,207 --> 01:34:54,334
sideboard, or what do you call it?

1956
01:34:54,417 --> 01:34:57,044
A credenza, to fill the empty space
behind the couch.

1957
01:34:57,128 --> 01:34:58,254
We never did any of it.

1958
01:34:58,338 --> 01:35:00,048
You turned down the residency
at the Geffen

1959
01:35:00,131 --> 01:35:02,299
that would've brought us here
for a — a year.

1960
01:35:02,383 --> 01:35:03,801
It wasn't something I wanted.

1961
01:35:03,885 --> 01:35:06,554
We had a great theater company
and a great life where we were.

1962
01:35:06,638 --> 01:35:09,182
-You call that a great life?
-You know what I mean.

1963
01:35:09,265 --> 01:35:11,976
I don't mean we had a great marriage.
I mean, life in Brooklyn.

1964
01:35:12,852 --> 01:35:13,853
Professionally.

1965
01:35:14,229 --> 01:35:16,814
I don't know. Honestly,
I never considered anything different.

1966
01:35:16,898 --> 01:35:18,524
Well, that's the problem, isn't it?

1967
01:35:18,608 --> 01:35:21,694
I mean, I was your wife.
You should've considered my happiness too.

1968
01:35:21,778 --> 01:35:25,406
Come on, you were happy.
You've just decided you weren't now.

1969
01:35:26,699 --> 01:35:28,826
Okay. Okay.

1970
01:35:28,910 --> 01:35:29,994
Let's...

1971
01:35:30,620 --> 01:35:33,372
M-My work is here now, my family is here.

1972
01:35:33,456 --> 01:35:36,292
And I agreed to put Henry in school here
because your show went to series.

1973
01:35:36,376 --> 01:35:39,420
I did that knowing that when you were done
shooting, he'd come back to New York.

1974
01:35:39,504 --> 01:35:40,505
Honey, we never said that.

1975
01:35:40,588 --> 01:35:43,215
That may have been your assumption,
but we never expressly said that.

1976
01:35:43,299 --> 01:35:45,884
- We did say it.
- When did we say it?

1977
01:35:45,969 --> 01:35:47,845
I don't know when we said it,
but we said it.

1978
01:35:47,929 --> 01:35:49,764
-I thought —
-We said it that time on the phone!

1979
01:35:49,847 --> 01:35:51,390
Honey, let me finish. Sorry.

1980
01:35:51,474 --> 01:35:52,766
I keep saying that.

1981
01:35:52,850 --> 01:35:55,727
I thought that if Henry was happy here,

1982
01:35:55,812 --> 01:35:58,648
and my show continued,
that we might do LA for a while.

1983
01:35:58,731 --> 01:36:00,941
I was not privy to that thought process.

1984
01:36:01,025 --> 01:36:02,651
The only reason we didn't live here

1985
01:36:02,735 --> 01:36:04,445
is because you can't imagine desires

1986
01:36:04,529 --> 01:36:06,989
other than your own,
unless they're forced on you.

1987
01:36:07,073 --> 01:36:10,076
Okay, you wish you hadn't married me,
you wish you had a different life,

1988
01:36:10,159 --> 01:36:11,535
but this is what happened.

1989
01:36:12,704 --> 01:36:14,038
-So, what do we do?
-I don't know.

1990
01:36:16,374 --> 01:36:18,084
Nora says
there's no coming back from this.

1991
01:36:18,167 --> 01:36:21,712
Fuck Nora! I hate fucking Nora
telling me I always lived in LA

1992
01:36:21,796 --> 01:36:23,506
even though I never lived in LA.

1993
01:36:24,465 --> 01:36:26,425
How could you have her
say those things about me?

1994
01:36:26,509 --> 01:36:28,177
Jay said them about me too.

1995
01:36:28,720 --> 01:36:30,138
You shouldn't have fired Bert.

1996
01:36:30,221 --> 01:36:31,430
I needed my own asshole.

1997
01:36:33,182 --> 01:36:37,102
Let's just both agree both of our lawyers
said shitty stuff about both of us.

1998
01:36:37,186 --> 01:36:38,604
Nora was worse.

1999
01:36:38,688 --> 01:36:39,980
Jay called me an alcoholic.

2000
01:36:40,064 --> 01:36:42,816
You pulled the rug out from under me
and you're putting me through hell.

2001
01:36:42,900 --> 01:36:44,610
You put me through hell
during our marriage.

2002
01:36:44,694 --> 01:36:45,903
Is that what that was, hell?

2003
01:36:45,987 --> 01:36:48,197
And now you're going to put Henry
through this horrible thing

2004
01:36:48,281 --> 01:36:50,866
-so you can yet again get what you want!
-It's not what I want.

2005
01:36:50,950 --> 01:36:53,202
I mean, it's what I want,
but it's what was...

2006
01:36:53,578 --> 01:36:54,829
was...

2007
01:36:54,912 --> 01:36:56,079
what's best for him.

2008
01:36:56,164 --> 01:36:59,625
Well, I was wondering when you'd
get around to Henry and what he wants.

2009
01:36:59,709 --> 01:37:00,626
Fuck off!

2010
01:37:00,710 --> 01:37:04,130
No, you fuck off!
If you'd listen to your son, or anyone,

2011
01:37:04,213 --> 01:37:05,964
then he'd tell you
that he'd rather live here!

2012
01:37:06,049 --> 01:37:07,842
Stop putting your feelings about me
onto Henry.

2013
01:37:07,925 --> 01:37:09,426
He tells me he likes it better here.

2014
01:37:09,510 --> 01:37:11,678
He tells you because he knows
it's what you want to hear!

2015
01:37:11,763 --> 01:37:14,432
He tells me you're on the phone all
the time. You don't play with him.

2016
01:37:14,515 --> 01:37:17,643
Because I'm going through a divorce in LA
and trying to direct a play in New York!

2017
01:37:17,727 --> 01:37:20,771
Which closed because I wasn't there.
It was a huge opportunity for me...

2018
01:37:20,855 --> 01:37:22,773
You're fighting for something
you don't even want!

2019
01:37:22,857 --> 01:37:24,191
And I let everyone down.

2020
01:37:24,275 --> 01:37:26,360
You're being so much like your father.

2021
01:37:26,819 --> 01:37:28,487
Do not compare me to my father!

2022
01:37:28,571 --> 01:37:30,781
I didn't compare you to him.
I said you were acting like him.

2023
01:37:30,865 --> 01:37:32,074
You're exactly like your mother.

2024
01:37:32,158 --> 01:37:35,327
Everything you were complaining about her,
you're doing. You're suffocating Henry.

2025
01:37:35,411 --> 01:37:38,122
First of all, I love my mother.
She was a wonderful mother.

2026
01:37:38,206 --> 01:37:40,750
-I'm just repeating what you told me.
-Secondly, how dare you

2027
01:37:40,833 --> 01:37:42,459
compare my mothering to my mother!

2028
01:37:42,543 --> 01:37:45,504
I may be like my father,
but I am not like my mother!

2029
01:37:45,588 --> 01:37:46,589
You are!

2030
01:37:46,672 --> 01:37:48,215
And you're like my father!

2031
01:37:48,299 --> 01:37:49,717
You're also like my mother!

2032
01:37:49,801 --> 01:37:52,011
You're all the bad things
about all of these people!

2033
01:37:52,512 --> 01:37:53,596
But mostly your mother.

2034
01:37:53,679 --> 01:37:55,013
When we would lie in bed together,

2035
01:37:55,098 --> 01:37:57,934
sometimes I would look at you and see her
and just feel so gross!

2036
01:37:58,017 --> 01:38:00,728
-I felt repulsed when you touched me!
-You're a slob.

2037
01:38:00,812 --> 01:38:02,438
I made all the beds,
closed all the cabinets...

2038
01:38:02,522 --> 01:38:05,816
The thought of having sex with you
makes me want to peel my skin off.

2039
01:38:05,900 --> 01:38:08,193
You'll never be happy, in LA or anywhere.

2040
01:38:08,277 --> 01:38:10,821
You'll think you found
some better opposite guy than me,

2041
01:38:10,905 --> 01:38:13,282
and in a few years,
you'll rebel against him

2042
01:38:13,366 --> 01:38:16,494
because you need to have your voice,
but you don't want a voice.

2043
01:38:16,577 --> 01:38:18,870
You just want to fucking complain
about not having a voice!

2044
01:38:18,955 --> 01:38:22,208
I think about being married to you,
and that woman is a stranger to me.

2045
01:38:22,834 --> 01:38:25,211
-I mean, we had a child's marriage.
-You've regressed.

2046
01:38:25,294 --> 01:38:27,921
You've gone back to your life
before you met me, it's pathetic.

2047
01:38:28,005 --> 01:38:32,092
People used to tell me that you were
too selfish to be a great artist.

2048
01:38:32,176 --> 01:38:33,677
And I used to defend you.

2049
01:38:33,761 --> 01:38:35,137
They were absolutely right.

2050
01:38:35,221 --> 01:38:37,932
All your best acting is behind you.
You're back to being a hack!

2051
01:38:38,015 --> 01:38:41,184
You gaslighted me!
You're a fucking villain!

2052
01:38:41,269 --> 01:38:44,730
You want to present yourself as a victim
because it's a good legal strategy?

2053
01:38:44,814 --> 01:38:47,900
Fine, but you and I both know
you chose this life!

2054
01:38:48,401 --> 01:38:50,486
You wanted it until you didn't!

2055
01:38:51,362 --> 01:38:53,614
You used me so you could get out of LA.

2056
01:38:53,698 --> 01:38:54,740
I didn't use you.

2057
01:38:54,824 --> 01:38:57,243
You did, and then you blamed me for it!

2058
01:38:57,326 --> 01:38:59,745
You always made me aware
of what I was doing wrong,

2059
01:38:59,829 --> 01:39:01,121
how I was falling short!

2060
01:39:01,205 --> 01:39:02,915
Life with you was joyless!

2061
01:39:02,999 --> 01:39:05,543
What, so then you had to go
and fuck someone else?

2062
01:39:05,626 --> 01:39:07,210
You shouldn't be upset that I fucked her!

2063
01:39:07,295 --> 01:39:09,171
You should be upset
that I had a laugh with her!

2064
01:39:09,255 --> 01:39:10,089
Do you love her?

2065
01:39:10,173 --> 01:39:11,340
No.

2066
01:39:11,424 --> 01:39:13,968
But she didn't hate me. You hated me.

2067
01:39:14,051 --> 01:39:14,968
You hated me.

2068
01:39:15,052 --> 01:39:16,928
You fucked somebody we worked with.

2069
01:39:17,013 --> 01:39:19,515
You stopped having sex with me
in the last year.

2070
01:39:19,599 --> 01:39:21,100
I never cheated on you.

2071
01:39:21,184 --> 01:39:22,268
That was cheating on me!

2072
01:39:22,351 --> 01:39:24,311
But there was so much I could have done.

2073
01:39:24,395 --> 01:39:26,897
I was a director in my twenties
who came from nothing

2074
01:39:26,981 --> 01:39:30,234
and was suddenly on the cover
of fucking Time Out New York!

2075
01:39:30,318 --> 01:39:33,321
I was hot shit and I wanted
to fuck everybody and I didn't.

2076
01:39:33,404 --> 01:39:35,656
And I loved you
and I didn't want to lose you.

2077
01:39:35,740 --> 01:39:38,576
But I'm in my twenties,
and I didn't want to lose that too,

2078
01:39:38,659 --> 01:39:40,202
and I kinda did!

2079
01:39:40,661 --> 01:39:43,038
And you wanted so much so fast.

2080
01:39:43,122 --> 01:39:44,832
I didn't even want to get married.

2081
01:39:44,916 --> 01:39:46,500
And fuck it!

2082
01:39:46,834 --> 01:39:48,544
There's so much I didn't do.

2083
01:39:48,628 --> 01:39:51,297
- Thanks for that!
- You're welcome!

2084
01:39:51,380 --> 01:39:54,549
I can't believe
I have to know you forever!

2085
01:39:54,634 --> 01:39:56,844
You're fucking insane!

2086
01:39:57,512 --> 01:39:59,722
And you're fucking winning!

2087
01:40:00,348 --> 01:40:01,932
Are you kidding me?

2088
01:40:02,308 --> 01:40:04,143
I wanted to be married.

2089
01:40:04,685 --> 01:40:06,019
I'd already lost!

2090
01:40:06,479 --> 01:40:08,814
You didn't love me as much as I loved you!

2091
01:40:10,650 --> 01:40:12,360
What does that have to do with LA?

2092
01:40:14,695 --> 01:40:15,529
What?

2093
01:40:15,613 --> 01:40:19,033
You're so merged
with your own selfishness,

2094
01:40:19,116 --> 01:40:22,244
you don't even identify it
as selfishness anymore!

2095
01:40:22,620 --> 01:40:24,872
You're such a dick!

2096
01:40:24,956 --> 01:40:27,583
Every day I wake up
and I hope you're dead!

2097
01:40:27,667 --> 01:40:30,753
Dead, like if I could guarantee
Henry would be okay,

2098
01:40:30,836 --> 01:40:34,631
I'd hope you'd get an illness,
and then get hit by a car and die!

2099
01:40:54,527 --> 01:40:56,445
God!

2100
01:41:06,414 --> 01:41:07,248
I'm sorry.

2101
01:41:09,166 --> 01:41:10,125
Me too.

2102
01:41:36,068 --> 01:41:38,361
Okay. No, we can make this nice.

2103
01:41:38,738 --> 01:41:41,949
Um, I would take the smaller plants
and put them by the window.

2104
01:41:42,825 --> 01:41:45,410
And, do you have things
we can put on the walls?

2105
01:42:05,056 --> 01:42:07,224
All right, that's it.
Thank you very much.

2106
01:42:07,308 --> 01:42:09,601
We miss you,
and it looks great, really.

2107
01:42:09,685 --> 01:42:11,311
-Let us know how it goes, okay?
-All right.

2108
01:42:11,395 --> 01:42:13,480
I'll see you guys on, on Monday.

2109
01:42:13,814 --> 01:42:16,441
- Love you.
- All right, love you too. Bye.

2110
01:42:40,925 --> 01:42:42,718
Why do we have so many plants
all of a sudden?

2111
01:42:42,802 --> 01:42:45,554
We'll have to return some of that stuff,
so don't get too used to it.

2112
01:42:45,638 --> 01:42:47,556
I find plants kind of scary.

2113
01:42:47,932 --> 01:42:49,308
These plants are good guys.

2114
01:42:50,309 --> 01:42:51,893
Hey, come here.

2115
01:42:54,480 --> 01:42:55,355
Yeah?

2116
01:42:57,149 --> 01:43:00,277
Tomorrow, this woman is going to come
and visit us...

2117
01:43:01,320 --> 01:43:03,864
and be with us while we eat dinner.

2118
01:43:03,948 --> 01:43:06,200
-Is it your girlfriend?
-No,no.

2119
01:43:06,283 --> 01:43:08,994
-Is it Mommy's boyfriend?
-No. Why? Does Mommy have a boyfriend?

2120
01:43:09,078 --> 01:43:11,163
I don't know. Does she?

2121
01:43:11,247 --> 01:43:13,666
-I don't know.
-I don't know.

2122
01:43:15,126 --> 01:43:16,710
Why is someone watching us eat dinner?

2123
01:43:16,794 --> 01:43:18,253
I know, it's weird.

2124
01:43:18,963 --> 01:43:20,673
It's just something we have to do.

2125
01:43:21,090 --> 01:43:22,758
Which has to do with...

2126
01:43:23,134 --> 01:43:25,386
Mommy and me figuring out everything...

2127
01:43:26,345 --> 01:43:27,721
and how we're going to be.

2128
01:43:28,639 --> 01:43:29,473
Um...

2129
01:43:30,224 --> 01:43:31,225
You know?

2130
01:43:32,560 --> 01:43:33,727
Will you read to me?

2131
01:43:34,895 --> 01:43:36,062
Sure. Grab your book.

2132
01:43:37,356 --> 01:43:39,066
Do you use drugs or alcohol?

2133
01:43:39,483 --> 01:43:40,484
I drink alcohol.

2134
01:43:41,068 --> 01:43:42,861
How much alcohol do you drink?

2135
01:43:45,281 --> 01:43:47,616
I don't know, a glass of wine with dinner.

2136
01:43:47,700 --> 01:43:49,660
- Sometimes more.
- How much more?

2137
01:43:51,620 --> 01:43:53,246
It's... Sometimes a...

2138
01:43:53,581 --> 01:43:54,665
a few...

2139
01:43:55,416 --> 01:43:58,836
I... sometimes split a bottle of wine
with someone.

2140
01:43:58,919 --> 01:44:00,921
- Okay, who do you split it with?
- I mean...

2141
01:44:01,005 --> 01:44:04,591
if I'm having dinner with someone
and we order a bottle of wine.

2142
01:44:04,675 --> 01:44:06,968
- Okay.
- You know, like at a restaurant.

2143
01:44:07,052 --> 01:44:10,889
When you say, "Do you want to go
by the glass or do we get a bottle?"

2144
01:44:11,807 --> 01:44:14,518
- You get a bottle?
- Well, sometimes.

2145
01:44:15,978 --> 01:44:18,188
I mean, sometimes I go by the glass.

2146
01:44:18,898 --> 01:44:20,024
You know, it depends.

2147
01:44:24,528 --> 01:44:27,697
Did you mean drugs ever?
I have done drugs.

2148
01:44:29,033 --> 01:44:30,034
In college.

2149
01:44:31,035 --> 01:44:33,871
- Anything since you've been —
-I... I don't do it regularly.

2150
01:44:33,954 --> 01:44:35,664
Anything since you've been a mother?

2151
01:44:38,042 --> 01:44:39,334
Pot a few times.

2152
01:44:40,377 --> 01:44:43,296
Coke once at a party.
I mean, Henry wasn't with me.

2153
01:44:45,883 --> 01:44:48,844
What would you say
are your strengths as a parent?

2154
01:44:56,977 --> 01:44:57,811
I listen.

2155
01:44:59,271 --> 01:45:00,272
I play-

2156
01:45:02,608 --> 01:45:05,193
I-I put in the time. I...

2157
01:45:05,903 --> 01:45:06,862
love...

2158
01:45:07,863 --> 01:45:09,447
taking care of him...

2159
01:45:10,199 --> 01:45:11,783
watching him grow.

2160
01:45:13,869 --> 01:45:14,828
And sometimes...

2161
01:45:15,412 --> 01:45:19,165
what they say about "it goes so fast"
is true, but...

2162
01:45:20,626 --> 01:45:22,085
sometimes it's not.

2163
01:45:22,169 --> 01:45:24,838
Sometimes it goes too slow, honestly.

2164
01:45:26,215 --> 01:45:27,883
What are your weaknesses?

2165
01:45:30,803 --> 01:45:33,472
I'm too precise. I care too much.

2166
01:45:34,223 --> 01:45:36,141
Are those weaknesses?

2167
01:45:38,185 --> 01:45:39,019
Maybe not.

2168
01:45:42,314 --> 01:45:44,899
You know, he can be an asshole and...

2169
01:45:45,651 --> 01:45:48,278
I can get really pissed off,
and I'll call him on being an asshole —

2170
01:45:48,362 --> 01:45:49,738
I'm going to stop you there.

2171
01:45:50,197 --> 01:45:52,324
When you do this for real,
don't ever say that.

2172
01:45:52,408 --> 01:45:54,576
People don't accept mothers
who drink too much wine

2173
01:45:54,660 --> 01:45:56,662
and yell at their child
and call him an asshole.

2174
01:45:56,745 --> 01:45:58,246
I get it. I do it too.

2175
01:45:58,956 --> 01:46:01,041
We can accept an imperfect dad.

2176
01:46:01,125 --> 01:46:05,420
Let's face it, the idea of a good father
was only invented like 30 years ago.

2177
01:46:05,963 --> 01:46:08,966
Before that,
fathers were expected to be silent

2178
01:46:09,049 --> 01:46:12,802
and absent and unreliable and selfish,

2179
01:46:12,887 --> 01:46:15,389
and we can all say
we want them to be different.

2180
01:46:15,472 --> 01:46:18,766
But on some basic level,
we accept them.

2181
01:46:18,851 --> 01:46:20,894
We love them for their fallibilities,

2182
01:46:20,978 --> 01:46:24,815
but people absolutely don't accept
those same failings in mothers.

2183
01:46:24,899 --> 01:46:27,818
We don't accept it structurally
and we don't accept it spiritually.

2184
01:46:27,902 --> 01:46:31,697
Because the basis
of our Judeo-Christian whatever

2185
01:46:31,780 --> 01:46:35,408
is Mary, Mother of Jesus,
and she's perfect.

2186
01:46:35,492 --> 01:46:38,244
She's a virgin who gives birth,

2187
01:46:38,704 --> 01:46:43,204
unwaveringly supports her child
and holds his dead body when he's gone.

2188
01:46:43,834 --> 01:46:46,545
And the dad isn't there.
He didn't even do the fucking.

2189
01:46:46,879 --> 01:46:48,005
God is in heaven.

2190
01:46:49,006 --> 01:46:53,051
God is the father, and God didn't show up.

2191
01:46:53,344 --> 01:46:57,306
So, you have to be perfect, and Charlie
can be a fuck up and it doesn't matter.

2192
01:46:58,432 --> 01:47:01,726
You will always be held
to a different, higher standard.

2193
01:47:02,144 --> 01:47:05,313
And it's fucked up,
but that is the way it is.

2194
01:47:14,615 --> 01:47:16,700
Ooh! Whoosh!

2195
01:47:32,299 --> 01:47:35,802
I think I rang the wrong bell.
Nancy Katz.

2196
01:47:35,886 --> 01:47:37,178
Hi, I'm Charlie Barber.

2197
01:47:37,805 --> 01:47:39,473
Henry's just playing in his room.

2198
01:47:40,975 --> 01:47:42,351
Nancy, can I get you anything?

2199
01:47:42,434 --> 01:47:45,437
Um, I'm easy. A glass of water?

2200
01:47:54,196 --> 01:47:55,947
It's a new apartment.

2201
01:48:02,871 --> 01:48:04,080
Shall we go in here?

2202
01:48:04,164 --> 01:48:04,998
Sure.

2203
01:48:12,006 --> 01:48:12,923
Um...

2204
01:48:22,349 --> 01:48:25,268
Um, what's a day like
for the two of you here?

2205
01:48:25,811 --> 01:48:28,313
Well, if he has school,
I take him there, of course,

2206
01:48:28,397 --> 01:48:30,399
and pick him up, assuming I can do both.

2207
01:48:30,482 --> 01:48:32,567
What prevents you from picking him up?

2208
01:48:32,860 --> 01:48:33,735
Um...

2209
01:48:34,319 --> 01:48:37,905
You know, work. I'm preparing a play
I'm directing in a few months.

2210
01:48:37,990 --> 01:48:39,491
What is that?

2211
01:48:39,575 --> 01:48:42,494
Kasimir und Karoline by ("Ödön von Horváth.

2212
01:48:42,578 --> 01:48:44,454
We're doing it at the Barrow in New York.

2213
01:48:44,538 --> 01:48:46,039
So, you have to be away?

2214
01:48:46,123 --> 01:48:49,251
Yes, recently, since Nicole's
been working on the show in LA,

2215
01:48:49,334 --> 01:48:50,835
I come back and forth a lot.

2216
01:48:51,295 --> 01:48:52,963
- That sounds difficult.
- It is.

2217
01:48:53,922 --> 01:48:56,841
And expensive. I'll try to take him
with me some of the time,

2218
01:48:56,925 --> 01:48:59,052
but Nicole doesn't like for him
to fly so much.

2219
01:48:59,136 --> 01:49:02,639
Well, that can be hard on a child,
all that recycled air.

2220
01:49:04,433 --> 01:49:05,976
Well, he's sturdy.

2221
01:49:06,351 --> 01:49:08,728
Some parents won't take their kids
to a restaurant

2222
01:49:08,812 --> 01:49:10,647
because of these superbugs.

2223
01:49:14,818 --> 01:49:18,446
I noticed on one visit to Los Angeles,
you came on a Sunday

2224
01:49:18,530 --> 01:49:19,948
and left on a Thursday.

2225
01:49:20,032 --> 01:49:21,742
Why not stay for a weekend?

2226
01:49:22,326 --> 01:49:26,826
Um, on that time,
I had tech for Electra in New York.

2227
01:49:27,748 --> 01:49:28,915
What's that?

2228
01:49:29,875 --> 01:49:31,710
It was my Broadway debut.

2229
01:49:31,794 --> 01:49:34,004
I don't know what "tech" is.

2230
01:49:34,088 --> 01:49:37,549
It's the technical part of the production.
You figure out the lights.

2231
01:49:37,633 --> 01:49:39,760
-And Monday's our day off.
-What's a weekend day like?

2232
01:49:39,843 --> 01:49:42,512
Well, out here, he has basketball
on Saturday at 12.

2233
01:49:42,596 --> 01:49:43,680
Eleven, I'm sorry.

2234
01:49:43,764 --> 01:49:46,224
And so, we go there.
And then, afterwards...

2235
01:49:47,184 --> 01:49:50,687
maybe we'll get lunch somewhere,
and then, if there's a movie to see...

2236
01:49:50,938 --> 01:49:52,564
Does he like basketball?

2237
01:49:52,648 --> 01:49:53,774
He does.

2238
01:49:53,857 --> 01:49:57,235
His coach, Rick, says
he's a good dribbler, and I've seen that.

2239
01:49:57,653 --> 01:49:58,862
Ron.

2240
01:49:59,696 --> 01:50:01,656
Sorry, his coach's name is Ron.

2241
01:50:01,740 --> 01:50:03,408
Rick's his dentist in New York.

2242
01:50:03,492 --> 01:50:06,536
Well, you know our home home was —
is in New York.

2243
01:50:06,620 --> 01:50:08,121
That's where we live.

2244
01:50:08,205 --> 01:50:10,165
New York is a long way from here.

2245
01:50:10,707 --> 01:50:12,458
Well, we like it because we can walk.

2246
01:50:12,543 --> 01:50:14,336
You can walk here.

2247
01:50:14,419 --> 01:50:15,378
Not really.

2248
01:50:15,462 --> 01:50:17,213
And the space...

2249
01:50:23,470 --> 01:50:24,679
Do you like your school?

2250
01:50:25,848 --> 01:50:26,890
I love it.

2251
01:50:26,974 --> 01:50:29,101
What's your favorite part about it?

2252
01:50:29,560 --> 01:50:30,477
I don't know.

2253
01:50:32,062 --> 01:50:32,896
Maybe gym“-

2254
01:50:33,355 --> 01:50:34,564
You like math.

2255
01:50:35,732 --> 01:50:36,816
Not anymore.

2256
01:50:38,610 --> 01:50:39,861
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

2257
01:50:39,945 --> 01:50:42,447
- But you're getting really good at it.
- No.

2258
01:50:43,574 --> 01:50:44,992
Well, you are, but...

2259
01:50:47,744 --> 01:50:50,037
What do you and your dad
like to do together?

2260
01:50:50,747 --> 01:50:53,332
When I'm at my dad's,
we sometimes watch a movie,

2261
01:50:53,417 --> 01:50:55,043
or build a LEGO, or something.

2262
01:50:55,878 --> 01:50:58,005
My dad's a great LEGO builder.

2263
01:50:58,088 --> 01:50:59,422
And at your mom's?

2264
01:51:00,174 --> 01:51:03,677
At home, I have most of my toys,
and there's a pool,

2265
01:51:04,178 --> 01:51:06,221
and I have a tree house and jungle gym.

2266
01:51:07,931 --> 01:51:11,351
We have super secret treasure hunt,
which is really fun.

2267
01:51:12,769 --> 01:51:16,272
-Sweetheart?
-Army men ride in here and —

2268
01:51:16,356 --> 01:51:17,982
Want to help me set the table?

2269
01:51:18,525 --> 01:51:19,526
Do I have to?

2270
01:51:19,610 --> 01:51:22,154
-Just come in here and grab a plate.
-I'm playing.

2271
01:51:22,237 --> 01:51:23,071
Henry?

2272
01:51:24,323 --> 01:51:25,532
Okay.

2273
01:51:26,450 --> 01:51:27,451
Fine.

2274
01:51:31,538 --> 01:51:33,373
-Why are you being like this?
-What?

2275
01:51:33,457 --> 01:51:35,333
If I ask you to help out, help out.

2276
01:51:35,417 --> 01:51:37,502
-What is this?
-Special Meal.

2277
01:51:38,420 --> 01:51:40,296
What are the green things?

2278
01:51:40,380 --> 01:51:42,465
There aren't green things in Special Meal.

2279
01:51:42,549 --> 01:51:44,842
It's just a garnish.

2280
01:51:44,927 --> 01:51:45,844
I'll take it off.

2281
01:51:46,970 --> 01:51:48,972
I don't want to eat anything it touched.

2282
01:51:49,056 --> 01:51:52,768
-It doesn't change the taste of anything.
-I might want to be a vegetarian.

2283
01:51:53,393 --> 01:51:54,560
Mom's a vegetarian.

2284
01:51:54,645 --> 01:51:56,021
Is she a vegetarian now?

2285
01:51:56,605 --> 01:51:58,398
-Yeah.
-Well, then, you should like garnish.

2286
01:51:58,482 --> 01:52:00,358
It's all garnish, vegetarianism.

2287
01:52:02,361 --> 01:52:03,820
I'm done with my water.

2288
01:52:13,872 --> 01:52:15,164
Sure I can't get you anything?

2289
01:52:15,249 --> 01:52:16,959
No, I'm fine, thank you.

2290
01:52:19,586 --> 01:52:20,962
Do the thing with the knife.

2291
01:52:21,046 --> 01:52:22,881
No, I'm not.

2292
01:52:23,840 --> 01:52:24,674
No.

2293
01:52:25,634 --> 01:52:26,801
Come on.

2294
01:52:26,885 --> 01:52:28,094
It's not a dinner thing.

2295
01:52:31,139 --> 01:52:32,598
It's not an anytime thing.

2296
01:52:33,100 --> 01:52:34,768
What's the thing with the knife?

2297
01:52:35,602 --> 01:52:36,769
It's hilarious.

2298
01:52:36,853 --> 01:52:39,313
No, it's dumb.
I have a small knife on my key chain,

2299
01:52:39,398 --> 01:52:40,649
which is only for adults.

2300
01:52:42,317 --> 01:52:44,068
And I do a thing with it sometimes.

2301
01:52:45,612 --> 01:52:47,196
You said I could get a knife.

2302
01:52:47,698 --> 01:52:49,574
A jackknife, yeah, when you're older.

2303
01:52:50,284 --> 01:52:51,118
Like ten.

2304
01:52:51,743 --> 01:52:53,161
No, like 20.

2305
01:52:53,829 --> 01:52:54,663
Yeah.

2306
01:53:00,168 --> 01:53:04,422
Dime, rime, lime, pime, sime...

2307
01:53:04,506 --> 01:53:06,716
Honey, stop guessing.
You're so close. Stay with it.

2308
01:53:06,800 --> 01:53:08,802
I don't want to do it.

2309
01:53:08,885 --> 01:53:12,388
- What's the first letter?
- I don't want to do it. Can I do the iPad?

2310
01:53:12,472 --> 01:53:13,931
No, look. What's the first letter?

2311
01:53:14,308 --> 01:53:16,476
-I don't want to.
-It's a T. What sound does T make?

2312
01:53:16,560 --> 01:53:19,020
-Tuh.
-Right. Then just do the rest of it.

2313
01:53:19,479 --> 01:53:20,563
Dime.

2314
01:53:21,356 --> 01:53:22,231
No.

2315
01:53:22,316 --> 01:53:24,609
You have "tuh" and "ime." What is that?

2316
01:53:27,738 --> 01:53:28,613
Time.

2317
01:53:29,281 --> 01:53:30,115
It's time.

2318
01:53:31,366 --> 01:53:32,408
It's time.

2319
01:53:37,581 --> 01:53:38,582
You'll see, honey.

2320
01:53:38,665 --> 01:53:41,626
One day, it's just going to click
and you'll be able to read everything.

2321
01:53:42,544 --> 01:53:44,170
I need a break.

2322
01:53:44,254 --> 01:53:45,964
Can I go play in my room?

2323
01:53:46,048 --> 01:53:46,882
Sure.

2324
01:53:49,301 --> 01:53:50,135
Hey.

2325
01:53:52,471 --> 01:53:53,305
Yeah?

2326
01:54:10,781 --> 01:54:12,657
Do you ever observe married people?

2327
01:54:12,741 --> 01:54:14,284
No. Why would I?

2328
01:54:14,368 --> 01:54:16,536
I was kidding.

2329
01:54:27,923 --> 01:54:31,259
The knife thing is...
I carry this knife on my key chain,

2330
01:54:31,343 --> 01:54:33,053
which his mother got me, actually.

2331
01:54:34,763 --> 01:54:37,265
And I do this thing for his mom
where I pretend to cut myself,

2332
01:54:37,349 --> 01:54:40,018
but I retract the blade,
but I-l don't do it with him.

2333
01:54:45,524 --> 01:54:47,067
-That's fine.
-Are you okay?

2334
01:54:47,150 --> 01:54:49,694
Yeah, I must not have retracted
the blade all the way.

2335
01:54:49,778 --> 01:54:51,070
- Do you need —
-Yeah.

2336
01:54:52,489 --> 01:54:54,657
Yeah, no, it's fine.

2337
01:54:54,741 --> 01:54:56,325
What else can I tell you?

2338
01:54:57,327 --> 01:55:00,079
-Um, I think I have enough.
-You have enough?

2339
01:55:00,705 --> 01:55:03,290
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Totally. I'm fine.

2340
01:55:03,917 --> 01:55:06,836
Well, I'll leave you guys for tonight.

2341
01:55:07,421 --> 01:55:08,380
Okay.

2342
01:55:09,297 --> 01:55:12,383
I'll be in touch
if I have further questions.

2343
01:55:13,468 --> 01:55:14,969
Thanks.

2344
01:55:15,053 --> 01:55:15,887
Um...

2345
01:55:17,139 --> 01:55:18,765
Thanks. Um...

2346
01:55:21,309 --> 01:55:23,519
Thanks. Thank you for the water.

2347
01:55:23,603 --> 01:55:26,147
- Yeah, sure.
- Are you sure you're okay?

2348
01:55:26,231 --> 01:55:27,607
- Yeah.
- Okay.

2349
01:55:28,525 --> 01:55:29,734
- '- BYE-bye.
- Bye

2350
01:55:34,739 --> 01:55:36,157
Sorry.

2351
01:55:37,576 --> 01:55:38,493
All right, let...

2352
01:55:41,371 --> 01:55:42,705
I think you turn the...

2353
01:55:46,460 --> 01:55:47,794
-Okay
-Sorry

2354
01:55:48,295 --> 01:55:49,129
Okay.

2355
01:56:52,817 --> 01:56:54,151
Dad, are you okay?

2356
01:56:54,903 --> 01:56:56,279
Yeah, I'm just tired.

2357
01:57:13,505 --> 01:57:15,048
Dad, did she like us?

2358
01:57:17,133 --> 01:57:19,510
Yeah, she thought we were great.

Guys, slow down.

2391
01:58:55,732 --> 01:58:56,774
So...

2392
01:58:56,858 --> 01:58:59,235
because Charlie dropped his claim
to New York

2393
01:58:59,361 --> 01:59:00,403
we're mostly done.

2394
01:59:00,862 --> 01:59:01,988
Jay's lost interest,

2395
01:59:02,155 --> 01:59:04,490
and Ted, his associate,
is doing the paperwork.

2396
01:59:04,574 --> 01:59:06,325
And we're not taking any money, right?

2397
01:59:06,409 --> 01:59:08,619
We withdrew our claim for the MacArthur,

2398
01:59:08,703 --> 01:59:10,871
which I think
we could have gotten, by the way,

2399
01:59:10,955 --> 01:59:13,207
and they're not asking
for any of the show.

2400
01:59:14,334 --> 01:59:16,169
Thank you for everything, Nora.

2401
01:59:16,252 --> 01:59:17,670
You're welcome, doll.

2402
01:59:18,421 --> 01:59:20,214
To your new home in LA.

2403
01:59:25,303 --> 01:59:26,137
And...

2404
01:59:26,471 --> 01:59:27,847
whenever Charlie is in LA,

2405
01:59:27,931 --> 01:59:30,975
I got the custody breakdown to be 55/45.

2406
01:59:31,434 --> 01:59:34,353
So you'll have Henry an extra day
every two weeks.

2407
01:59:34,771 --> 01:59:36,189
I thought we made it equal.

2408
01:59:36,272 --> 01:59:37,982
I tweaked it at the last minute.

2409
01:59:38,066 --> 01:59:40,902
I just didn't want him
to be able to say he got 50/50,

2410
01:59:40,985 --> 01:59:42,444
bragging to his friends.

2411
01:59:42,946 --> 01:59:44,989
- But I don't want to do that.
- Take it.

2412
01:59:45,448 --> 01:59:46,490
You won.

2413
02:00:12,934 --> 02:00:15,186
Hi. You look like a guy
who really cares about animals.

2414
02:00:15,270 --> 02:00:16,104
Nope.

2415
02:00:36,040 --> 02:00:37,833
My God!

2416
02:00:38,084 --> 02:00:38,918
Hi.

2417
02:00:54,392 --> 02:00:56,769
The couch was technically hers,
pre-marriage.

2418
02:00:56,853 --> 02:00:58,771
But I mean... it was our couch.

2419
02:00:58,855 --> 02:01:00,648
It's not like I was going to buy
another couch.

2420
02:01:00,732 --> 02:01:03,067
But then when it comes time to split,
it's suddenly her couch

2421
02:01:03,151 --> 02:01:04,569
and I have no couch, and...

2422
02:01:05,278 --> 02:01:06,570
Hey, guys, what's UP?

2423
02:01:07,447 --> 02:01:09,699
I'm sitting on the floor
is the short version.

2424
02:01:12,327 --> 02:01:15,079
I'm sorry.
This is all so self-pitying and boring.

2425
02:01:15,163 --> 02:01:16,164
No, come on.

2426
02:01:16,247 --> 02:01:17,998
No, it's so stupid. I'm sorry.

2427
02:01:18,082 --> 02:01:20,918
-It sounds really tough.
-No, no, no, no. it is sad.

Is that all you think there is to it?

02:05:22,326 --> 02:05:23,702

02:05:28,583 --> 02:05:30,001

- Hey.

2494
02:05:30,084 --> 02:05:33,087
Good, yeah. Denny's dead now. We shot
the scene where he merges with the ficus.

2495
02:05:33,171 --> 02:05:35,256
- Henry's upstairs.
- She got an Emmy nomination.

2496
02:05:35,673 --> 02:05:38,133
-She's a great actress.
-No, for directing.

2497
02:05:39,802 --> 02:05:41,637
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

2498
02:05:41,721 --> 02:05:44,515
Now I know what you were
so obsessed with all the time.

2499
02:05:44,599 --> 02:05:46,475
-Um, we should get ready.
-Yeah.

2500
02:05:46,559 --> 02:05:48,394
- We're the Beatles.
- Come on, Charlie.

2501
02:05:48,478 --> 02:05:49,979
I didn't really get a costume together.

2502
02:05:50,063 --> 02:05:52,273
-You could be George Martin.
-I don't need to be anything.

2503
02:05:52,356 --> 02:05:54,608
-You've got to be something.
-A ghost. I'll get you a sheet.

2504
02:05:54,692 --> 02:05:56,819
I have the album cover
if anyone needs to reference it.

2505
02:05:56,903 --> 02:05:59,780
And we should leave soon. I'm saying that
as much for me as anyone else.

2506
02:05:59,864 --> 02:06:02,366
- Am I John or George?
- Trick-or-treating starts at 5:00.

2507
02:06:02,450 --> 02:06:03,951
You're George. Nicole is John.

2508
02:06:10,875 --> 02:06:13,752
I wanted to tell you
I took a residency at UCLA.

2509
02:06:15,379 --> 02:06:17,839
I'm going to direct two plays

2510
02:06:21,677 --> 02:06:23,470
So, I'm going to be here for a while.

That's great.

2512
02:06:30,686 --> 02:06:31,895

2513
02:06:34,107 --> 02:06:34,941
Yeah.

02:08:34,393 --> 02:08:36,478
-I don't know this one.
-Embarrassing.

2548
02:08:37,313 --> 02:08:38,272
"...embarrassing,

2549
02:08:38,773 --> 02:08:42,109
wh-ich is hard for a man."

2550
02:08:43,110 --> 02:08:44,152
You read it now.

2551
02:08:46,447 --> 02:08:47,865
"He's very competitive.

2552
02:08:48,991 --> 02:08:50,701
He loves being a dad.

2553
02:08:51,953 --> 02:08:54,121
He loves all the things
you're supposed to hate,

2554
02:08:54,538 --> 02:08:55,956
like the tantrums,

2555
02:08:56,457 --> 02:08:57,875
the waking up at night.

2556
02:08:58,584 --> 02:09:01,044
It's almost annoying how much he likes it,

2557
02:09:01,420 --> 02:09:02,796
but then, it's mostly nice.

2558
02:09:04,090 --> 02:09:06,133
He disappears into his own world.

2559
02:09:06,217 --> 02:09:08,302
He and Henry are alike that way.

2560
02:09:09,804 --> 02:09:11,013
He can tell...

2561
02:09:11,347 --> 02:09:14,141
people they have food in their teeth

2562
02:09:14,809 --> 02:09:17,728
or on their face in a way
that doesn't make them feel bad.

2563
02:09:18,646 --> 02:09:20,022
Charlie is self-made.

2564
02:09:20,398 --> 02:09:22,817
His parents, I only met them once,

2565
02:09:22,900 --> 02:09:25,736
but he told me
there was a lot of alcohol...

2566
02:09:29,407 --> 02:09:31,909
He moved to New York from Indiana

2567
02:09:32,451 --> 02:09:33,368
with no safety net,

2568
02:09:33,452 --> 02:09:36,413
and now he's more New Yorker
than any New Yorker.

2569
02:09:37,206 --> 02:09:40,209
He's brilliant at creating family
out of whoever is around.

2570
02:09:40,584 --> 02:09:41,960
With the theater company...

2571
02:09:42,837 --> 02:09:44,338
he casts a spell...

2572
02:09:44,964 --> 02:09:47,549
that made everyone feel included.

2573
02:09:48,009 --> 02:09:50,845
No one, not even an intern,
was unimportant."

2574
02:09:52,013 --> 02:09:53,389
What's an intern?

2575
02:09:53,472 --> 02:09:55,098
It's like a...

2576
02:09:55,850 --> 02:09:57,476
helper, but who isn't paid.

2577
02:09:57,560 --> 02:09:59,144
Why aren't they paid?

2578
02:10:00,021 --> 02:10:02,023
They're young, they're learning.

2579
02:10:03,232 --> 02:10:06,235
I don't know, maybe if they do a good job,
they get paid later.

2580
02:10:06,319 --> 02:10:07,945
Okay, keep going.

2581
02:10:08,946 --> 02:10:12,950
"He could remember all the inside jokes,
he's extremely organized and thorough,

2582
02:10:13,034 --> 02:10:16,454
he's very clear about what he wants,
unlike me who can't always tell.

2583
02:10:17,038 --> 02:10:20,166
I fell in love with him
two seconds after I saw him.

2584
02:10:43,773 --> 02:10:45,733
And I'll never stop loving him,

2585
02:10:45,816 --> 02:10:47,859
even though
it doesn't make sense anymore."

2586
02:11:02,124 --> 02:11:04,501
-See you. Good seeing you.
-Good seeing you too.

2587
02:11:04,585 --> 02:11:06,378
- Charlie!
- G-ma.

2588
02:11:06,462 --> 02:11:08,589
I'm so happy you came.

2589
02:11:08,672 --> 02:11:10,173
I'll e-mail you that article.

2590
02:11:10,257 --> 02:11:11,383
-Yes, please do.
-Yeah.

2591
02:11:11,467 --> 02:11:13,385
- All right. Thank you.
- Take care.

2592
02:11:17,765 --> 02:11:20,684
We were going to bring him to dinner,
but he's so wiped out.

2593
02:11:20,768 --> 02:11:22,227
You want to take him?

2594
02:11:23,312 --> 02:11:25,314
-It's your night.
-I know.

2595
02:11:25,398 --> 02:11:27,441
-Yeah. I'll drop him back in the morning.
-Good.

2596
02:11:27,525 --> 02:11:29,527
Yeah, text me when you're up.
We'll figure something out.

2597
02:11:29,610 --> 02:11:31,445
You're going to go with your dad, okay?

2598
02:11:31,529 --> 02:11:32,988
- Okay.
- Yeah?

2599
02:11:43,833 --> 02:11:45,751
I love you.

2600
02:11:46,168 --> 02:11:47,502
I love you too.

2601
02:11:53,134 --> 02:11:54,051
Hey.

2602
02:12:06,147 --> 02:12:07,189
Thanks.
