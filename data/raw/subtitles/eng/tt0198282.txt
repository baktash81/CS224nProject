- [Narrator] There's an old
Indian legend that tells of the

24
00:01:20,083 --> 00:01:23,411
coming of the white-man and
it warns that the tribes

25
00:01:23,436 --> 00:01:26,798
will be conquered and
scattered, but it goes on to say

26
00:01:26,823 --> 00:01:29,771
that in time, there will
come along some young Braves

27
00:01:29,796 --> 00:01:33,040
who will rediscover the
long-forgotten truths

28
00:01:33,065 --> 00:01:34,178
of their forefathers.

29
00:01:34,885 --> 00:01:38,960
This story is about a rebellious
young Brave called Starbird

30
00:01:38,985 --> 00:01:40,508
and the truths he discovered.

31
00:01:41,139 --> 00:01:43,181
(roaring plane engine)

32
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:01,892
- [Starbird Voiceover] Let me
see, did he say turn the wheel

33
00:02:01,917 --> 00:02:04,813
left and step on the
right pedal to turn right?

34
00:02:05,466 --> 00:02:07,791
Or was that to turn left?

35
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:11,026
Oh boy, this isn't as
easy as it was yesterday.

36
00:02:11,289 --> 00:02:13,284

(raccoon squeaks)

44
00:03:57,498 --> 00:03:58,644
- [Man] Starbird?

45
00:03:59,033 --> 00:04:00,367
Nadine?

46
00:04:03,954 --> 00:04:06,348
- [Starbird] Nadine, will you marry me?

47
00:04:07,168 --> 00:04:10,210
- I might, if you'd only change your ways.

48
00:04:13,235 --> 00:04:14,904
- A man is what he is.

49
00:04:15,529 --> 00:04:18,995
- Sometimes I think you're
ashamed of being an Indian.

50
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:21,762
- I'm not.
- But you are not proud of it.

51
00:04:25,042 --> 00:04:25,952
Are you?

52
00:04:26,472 --> 00:04:27,847
- What's there to be proud of?

53
00:04:29,546 --> 00:04:32,622
- Starbird, why do you try
so hard to be different?

54
00:04:32,838 --> 00:04:34,846
To always oppose our way.

55
00:04:35,132 --> 00:04:36,761
- Some people have choices in life!

56
00:04:37,051 --> 00:04:37,986
Decisions to make.

57
00:04:38,148 --> 00:04:39,842
They get to choose where they wanna live,

58
00:04:39,867 --> 00:04:41,450
what they wanna do, who they wanna be.

59
00:04:42,093 --> 00:04:43,237
They're free!

60
00:04:44,085 --> 00:04:45,085
That's all I'm asking.

61
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,457
Just a chance to choose my own life.

62
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,120
Will you come with me?

63
00:05:10,626 --> 00:05:11,870
- No, Starbird.

64
00:05:12,632 --> 00:05:13,524
I can't.

65
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:15,176
- You're a coward, Starbird!

66
00:05:15,316 --> 00:05:16,647
You're a disgrace to all of us.

67
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:18,509
(tense music)

68
00:05:21,306 --> 00:05:22,890
Leave here, Starbird, forever!

69
00:05:28,238 --> 00:05:29,833
- We were friends once, Ramheart.

70
00:05:30,343 --> 00:05:31,844
Now you've turned against me.

71
00:05:32,194 --> 00:05:32,942
Why?

72
00:05:33,471 --> 00:05:36,042
- You don't deserve the honor
of being a member of this tribe.

73
00:05:38,482 --> 00:05:40,982
(rhythmic tribal music)

74
00:05:51,428 --> 00:05:53,304
- You shouldn't scorn, Starbird.

75
00:05:53,498 --> 00:05:54,743
You should take part.

76
00:05:55,029 --> 00:05:56,529
- [Starbird] Why, Grandfather?

77
00:05:56,734 --> 00:05:58,598
- You forget, the ritual is for us.

78
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:00,604
Not for those who look on.

79
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:03,180
You bear a proud name, Starbird.

80
00:06:03,855 --> 00:06:06,563
As I look at you now, I do
not see an Indian Brave.

81
00:06:09,392 --> 00:06:15,059
- [Narrator] Starbird was hurt
by his grandfather's blunt words.

82
00:06:15,651 --> 00:06:16,934
And his pride was stung.

83
00:06:17,766 --> 00:06:20,971
So he hotheadedly turned
in his ceremonial necklace.

84
00:06:21,418 --> 00:06:24,241
A symbol of being a member of the tribe.

85
00:06:28,646 --> 00:06:33,186
Now he knows for certain he
must leave the reservation,

86
00:06:33,211 --> 00:06:36,729
and make a life for himself elsewhere.

87
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:45,526
(somber acoustic guitar music)

88
00:06:58,217 --> 00:06:59,084
(car horn honks)

89
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:03,768
- Where you headed?

90
00:07:04,985 --> 00:07:05,882
- No place.

91
00:07:07,905 --> 00:07:09,785
- [Driver] It's pretty
rugged country, isn't it?

92
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,540
A man could get himself lost in there,

93
00:07:11,565 --> 00:07:13,615
have one heck of a time
finding his way out.

94
00:07:13,781 --> 00:07:14,574
- [Starbird] Yeah.

95
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:16,557
- [Driver] You lookin'
for some kind of work?

96
00:07:16,623 --> 00:07:17,663
- [Starbird] More or less.

97
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:19,435
- Well, we're diggin' some browse ways.

98
00:07:19,501 --> 00:07:20,802
- What are they?

99
00:07:20,981 --> 00:07:24,037
- Well they're traffic lanes
through very dense brush

100
00:07:24,062 --> 00:07:26,935
to allow the browse animals
like deer better access

101
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,439
to their natural food supply.

102
00:07:30,414 --> 00:07:32,301
I don't know for sure that
they're lookin' for any hands

103
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:34,286
right now but if you're
interested, you could ask.

104
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:36,610
- Oh I don't know, I...

105
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,448
I sort of like to fool around with motors.

106
00:07:41,112 --> 00:07:44,364
- Well, now we've got an
equipment depot at Mount Meadow,

107
00:07:44,389 --> 00:07:48,501
and there's an airport about
two-three miles down the road.

108
00:07:48,908 --> 00:07:50,709
Maybe that's what you're lookin' for.

109
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:07,237
(buzzing and whirring propeller)

110
00:08:12,411 --> 00:08:16,193
(roaring plane engine)

111
00:08:17,023 --> 00:08:18,463
- [Pilot] Is this your first flight?

112
00:08:18,534 --> 00:08:19,254
- [Starbird] Yeah.

113
00:08:20,665 --> 00:08:22,665
Boy, things sure look
different from up here.

114
00:08:30,161 --> 00:08:31,585
- [Pilot] Go ahead, try it.

115
00:08:40,445 --> 00:08:45,487
(moody wind music)

116
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:11,708
- [Narrator] Starbird was
really excited about flying.

117
00:09:11,965 --> 00:09:14,970
Soaring up there with the
eagles was the kind of freedom

118
00:09:14,995 --> 00:09:18,761
he'd had bottled up inside
himself for a long time.

119
00:09:19,229 --> 00:09:22,940
So, he didn't really mean
to steal the airplane,

120
00:09:22,965 --> 00:09:26,548
he just got carried away and
borrowed it for a little while.

121
00:09:26,979 --> 00:09:30,812
(buzzing and whirring propeller)

122
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:43,536

(Starbird groans)

126
00:10:07,183 --> 00:10:09,933
When Starbird regained consciousness,

127
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:12,500
he knew he was in serious trouble.

128
00:10:15,216 --> 00:10:17,227
His whole body hurt.

129
00:10:17,604 --> 00:10:19,383
His arm was broken.

130
00:10:19,657 --> 00:10:24,010
And he was a long, long
way from civilization.

131
00:10:35,774 --> 00:10:39,113
(crow squawks)

132
00:10:45,858 --> 00:10:47,278
The plane.
(ominous music)

133
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:51,355
He'd better salvage anything
from it he could use.

134
00:11:40,803 --> 00:11:44,169
He'd need the hatchet
and the matches for sure,

135
00:11:44,194 --> 00:11:46,876
but the thermos bottle was broken.

136
00:11:54,448 --> 00:11:55,313
Wait a minute.

137
00:11:55,944 --> 00:11:58,985
Maybe the pilot had put
his lunch in the plane.

138
00:12:03,652 --> 00:12:06,226
(Starbird groans)

139
00:12:15,861 --> 00:12:18,270
Seeing the young deer was comforting.

140
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:22,172
It reminded him he wasn't
really alone in the wilderness,

141
00:12:22,197 --> 00:12:25,758
and he remembered something
his grandfather had said long ago.

142
00:12:25,801 --> 00:12:27,384
(wind music)

143
00:12:28,088 --> 00:12:29,623
- [Grandfather] Animals are our brothers.

144
00:12:29,689 --> 00:12:31,560
We must help them whenever we can.

145
00:12:31,802 --> 00:12:33,062
Remember that, Starbird.

146
00:12:33,235 --> 00:12:34,610
- Yes, Grandfather.

147
00:12:50,581 --> 00:12:52,629
(crow squawks)

148
00:13:02,456 --> 00:13:07,372

150
00:13:25,969 --> 00:13:28,861
- [Narrator] The pain in
his broken arm was intense.

151
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:33,949
He knew the bone must be set,
and he must do it himself.

152
00:14:15,997 --> 00:14:21,038
(tense music)

153

- Hey!

Down here!

161
00:16:11,858 --> 00:16:13,519
Hey!

162
00:16:14,224 --> 00:16:15,641
Help me!

(somber acoustic guitar music)

164

- [Narrator] Now, Katie Crow
had been lookin' at that sack

165
00:16:41,181 --> 00:16:42,575
and wonderin' what was in it

166
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,737
ever since Starbird sat it down.

167
00:16:49,696 --> 00:16:50,501
- Get out of there!

168
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:52,755
- [Narrator] Well, no need to be rude.

169
00:16:53,171 --> 00:16:55,053
I was leaving anyway.

(moody tribal music)

171
00:17:33,712 --> 00:17:34,950
- [Starbird Voiceover]
Grandfather always said,

172
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:38,870
"if you're lost in the woods,
follow a river downstream."

173
00:17:39,367 --> 00:17:41,085
I guess I'll give it a try.

174
00:18:04,469 --> 00:18:07,617
- [Narrator] Seeing the baby
foxes and the young deer,

175
00:18:07,642 --> 00:18:12,296
Starbird had a warm feeling of
kinship with his brothers, the animals.

176
00:18:12,741 --> 00:18:15,611
Something he'd really never felt before.

177
00:18:18,807 --> 00:18:21,724
As he watched young Bandini the deer,

178
00:18:22,146 --> 00:18:25,656
Starbird suddenly realized
she was in danger.

181
00:18:39,553 --> 00:18:40,855
(Starbird whistles)

182
00:19:05,305 --> 00:19:06,766
(cougar roars)

183
00:19:37,704 --> 00:19:41,137
- [Narrator] Old Man Cougar
hadn't eaten for days,

184
00:19:41,162 --> 00:19:44,287
and he could practically
taste that tender young deer.

185
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:47,586
When that man thing scared it off.

186
00:19:47,964 --> 00:19:51,240
Now he was gonna have to run
his legs off to get a meal.

187
00:19:51,658 --> 00:19:54,055
Drat that man thing anyway.

188
00:19:54,241 --> 00:19:56,575
What is it doing in
this part of the forest?

189
00:19:57,174 --> 00:19:58,685
If it didn't smell so bad, (cougar roars)

190
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:01,147
he was half a mind to eat it instead.

191
00:20:01,801 --> 00:20:04,696
Of course he'd heard they tasted terrible.

192
00:20:07,251 --> 00:20:09,886
(melancholic piano music)

193
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:19,360
(crow squawks)

194
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:35,132
(jaunty upbeat music)

195
00:21:19,219 --> 00:21:20,718
(raccoon squeaks)

196
00:21:28,577 --> 00:21:30,055
- Hello, little fellow.

197
00:21:34,063 --> 00:21:35,071
Are you hungry, too?

198
00:21:35,464 --> 00:21:37,630
- [Narrator] Well, it sure
didn't look like Starbird

199
00:21:37,655 --> 00:21:39,489
was gonna be lonesome.

200
00:21:51,257 --> 00:21:53,042
(crow squawks)

201
00:21:53,096 --> 00:21:54,804
- You want some too?

202
00:22:00,838 --> 00:22:02,207
(crow squawks)

203
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,412
(crow squawks)

204
00:22:16,371 --> 00:22:17,572
(raccoon squeaks)

205
00:22:41,672 --> 00:22:43,000
(bear roars)

206
00:22:54,952 --> 00:22:58,354
You go away, I don't want
your momma comin' around!

207
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:18,152
(cougar roars)
(suspenseful music)

208
00:23:23,673 --> 00:23:25,210
(cougar roars)

209
00:23:43,232 --> 00:23:44,948
(cougar roars)

210
00:24:14,241 --> 00:24:17,876
- [Narrator] Trying to do
things with one hand was tough,

211
00:24:17,901 --> 00:24:20,052
but if you thought it through first,

212
00:24:20,077 --> 00:24:23,333
you could do most anything,
Starbird discovered.

213
00:24:25,418 --> 00:24:27,072
(playful music)

214
00:24:27,169 --> 00:24:30,457
As usual, Brother Bear
was lookin' things over.

215
00:24:31,098 --> 00:24:33,012
Well, what have we here?

216
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,247
A cave?

217
00:24:36,748 --> 00:24:38,130
Funny-lookin' cave.

218
00:24:38,825 --> 00:24:41,495
Sure wasn't made for short, fat bears.

219
00:25:15,582 --> 00:25:17,415
Well, pretty poor cave.

220
00:25:17,896 --> 00:25:19,341
Got a big hole in it.

221
00:25:26,202 --> 00:25:27,376
(xylophone glissando)

222
00:25:32,185 --> 00:25:33,487
- Back for dessert, huh?

223
00:25:46,476 --> 00:25:51,476
(owl hoots)
(peaceful piano music)

224
00:25:58,773 --> 00:26:02,860
(wolf howls)

225
00:26:05,875 --> 00:26:09,234
(peaceful orchestral music)

226
00:26:18,129 --> 00:26:20,070
- [Narrator] Starbird
was awakened by the feel

227
00:26:20,095 --> 00:26:21,694
of a rough tongue.

228
00:26:21,933 --> 00:26:24,648
It was friendly Brother Bear again.

229
00:26:25,276 --> 00:26:28,809
Starbird was still concerned
that the cub's mother

230
00:26:28,834 --> 00:26:31,152
might show up and bad-tempered.

231
00:26:31,878 --> 00:26:34,420
Starbird couldn't know it of course, but,

232
00:26:34,445 --> 00:26:36,820
little Brother Bear was an orphan.

233
00:26:42,191 --> 00:26:47,275
(atmospheric wind music)

234
00:26:49,462 --> 00:26:53,254
(suspenseful music)

235
00:27:03,533 --> 00:27:06,445
(cougar roars)

236
00:27:06,638 --> 00:27:09,513
Starbird didn't like the way
Old Man Cougar was lurkin'

237
00:27:09,538 --> 00:27:11,345
around growlin'.

238
00:27:11,775 --> 00:27:14,712
He decided he better cut
himself a spear for protection.

239
00:27:14,767 --> 00:27:16,781
(cougar growls)

240
00:27:26,047 --> 00:27:27,783
(cougar growls)

241
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:31,755
(cougar growls)

242
00:27:44,841 --> 00:27:46,470
(cougar growls)

243
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:49,895
(peaceful orchestral music)

244
00:28:14,677 --> 00:28:16,347
(raccoon squeaks)

245
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,225
- Goodbye, little fellas.

246
00:28:43,487 --> 00:28:44,646
Stay out of trouble.

247
00:28:46,946 --> 00:28:49,238
- [Narrator] He felt a growing
fondness for the little

248
00:28:49,263 --> 00:28:51,916
fellas and wondered
what would happen to 'em

249
00:28:51,941 --> 00:28:53,774
after he was gone.

250
00:28:56,549 --> 00:28:59,839
(crow squawks)

251
00:29:07,669 --> 00:29:10,827
(suspenseful music)

252
00:29:11,025 --> 00:29:12,817
(cougar roars)

253
00:29:18,067 --> 00:29:20,692
(peaceful upbeat music)

254
00:29:42,385 --> 00:29:43,613
(raccoon squeaks)

255
00:29:45,151 --> 00:29:47,511
- [Starbird] You're gonna get
your feet wet, little raccoon.

256
00:29:52,195 --> 00:29:53,272
(raccoon squeaks)

257
00:30:07,851 --> 00:30:09,277
- [Narrator] Naturally, Brother Bear

258
00:30:09,302 --> 00:30:10,988
intended going along, too.

259
00:30:11,296 --> 00:30:15,297
But first, he had to investigate
this strange-lookin' tree

260
00:30:15,322 --> 00:30:17,138
that Starbird had built.

261
00:30:17,701 --> 00:30:18,697
Hmm.

262
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:22,583
Well, it smelled like
any ordinary old tree.

263
00:30:23,526 --> 00:30:25,436
Nothin' hangin' on it good to eat.

264
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:31,992
Oops!

265
00:30:33,007 --> 00:30:34,979
Well, not much of a tree.

266
00:30:35,413 --> 00:30:36,777
Too flimsy.

267
00:30:44,142 --> 00:30:49,142
(suspenseful music)
(cougar growls)

268
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:56,769
(cougar roars)
(joyful music)

269
00:31:08,124 --> 00:31:09,137
(raccoon squeaks)

270
00:31:18,048 --> 00:31:20,519
Roger Raccoon didn't
have very good manners

271
00:31:20,544 --> 00:31:22,040
when it came to food.

272
00:31:22,282 --> 00:31:24,049
Mmm, boy!

273
00:31:24,364 --> 00:31:25,903
It's time for breakfast!

274
00:31:47,286 --> 00:31:48,549
(crow squawks)

275
00:31:53,132 --> 00:31:56,632
And Katie Crow who could
spot food a country-mile

276
00:31:56,657 --> 00:32:00,384
hollered out "hey, how about
some of that apple for me!"

277
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:04,284
Of course it sounded just
like "caw, caw" to Starbird,

278
00:32:04,309 --> 00:32:06,190
but he knew what she meant.

279
00:32:10,641 --> 00:32:11,592
(crow squawks)

280
00:32:12,929 --> 00:32:14,595
- Well, here's our friend again.

281
00:32:14,778 --> 00:32:16,445
Welcome, Brother Bear.

282
00:32:17,291 --> 00:32:18,485
You lonesome?

283
00:32:19,699 --> 00:32:21,032
Where's your momma?

284
00:32:22,425 --> 00:32:23,174
(raccoon squeaks)

285
00:32:23,511 --> 00:32:25,225
Somebody turn her into a rug?

286
00:32:26,401 --> 00:32:27,674
- [Narrator] Where is it?

287
00:32:27,699 --> 00:32:29,747
Don't tell me you ate it all, you pig!

288
00:32:30,465 --> 00:32:33,215
Raccoon, I ought to lay one on ya!

289
00:32:34,204 --> 00:32:35,246
(crow squawks)

290
00:32:41,343 --> 00:32:43,272
(raccoon squeaks)

291
00:32:53,003 --> 00:32:54,930
When he looked across at the splendor

292
00:32:54,955 --> 00:32:56,833
of the snow-capped peaks,

293
00:32:56,858 --> 00:32:59,397
it gave Starbird a strange feeling.

294
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:03,447
It almost seemed he'd been there before.

295
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:06,159
One of the legends of the Indian people

296
00:33:06,184 --> 00:33:09,664
is that the Great Spirit lives
on the top of the mountain.

297
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:13,966
Starbird felt a strong urge to go there.

298
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:15,632
(suspenseful keys)

299
00:33:19,508 --> 00:33:21,800
(upbeat piano music)

300
00:33:42,043 --> 00:33:43,750
- What have you got there?

301
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:48,264
Sweet William, huh?

302
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,610
- [Narrator] And that's how Brother Bear

303
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,507
got the name of Sweet William.

304
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:09,555
- Well, come on, Sweet William!

305
00:34:23,091 --> 00:34:25,221
(crow squawks)

306
00:34:36,714 --> 00:34:38,854
- [Narrator] Old Man Cougar was waiting.

307
00:34:39,146 --> 00:34:40,855
Hungry and mean.

308
00:34:41,157 --> 00:34:44,277
And everybody knew he meant trouble.

309
00:34:49,118 --> 00:34:52,497
(suspenseful music)

310
00:34:57,319 --> 00:34:59,746
(raccoon squeaks)
(cougar growls)

311
00:35:00,137 --> 00:35:02,678
(cougar roars)

312
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,681
(crow squawks)

313
00:35:08,373 --> 00:35:11,827
Sweet William and Roger
were both really frightened.

314
00:35:12,576 --> 00:35:14,050
There comes a time

315
00:35:14,075 --> 00:35:16,556
when a man must put his
courage to the test.

316
00:35:17,133 --> 00:35:18,918
(cougar roars)

317
00:35:21,135 --> 00:35:22,469
(cougar roars)

318
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:25,171
(cougar roars)

319
00:35:25,478 --> 00:35:28,888
Starbird knew he must face Old Man Cougar,

320
00:35:28,913 --> 00:35:30,328
no matter what happened.

321
00:35:30,494 --> 00:35:34,191
- Now I know a mountain lion
doesn't wanna attack a human,

322
00:35:34,221 --> 00:35:35,904
but if you wanna mess
with my friends here,

323
00:35:35,929 --> 00:35:37,554
you're gonna have to mess with me.

324
00:35:37,646 --> 00:35:39,038
Come on, move.

325
00:35:39,162 --> 00:35:41,227
Move!
(cougar roars)

326
00:35:43,651 --> 00:35:44,922
(cougar roars)

327
00:35:45,357 --> 00:35:46,277
(cougar roars)

328
00:35:46,405 --> 00:35:47,905
(crow squawks)

329
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:49,756
(cougar roars)

330
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,027
Get out, move!

331
00:35:54,184 --> 00:35:55,226
(cougar roars)

332
00:35:55,873 --> 00:35:56,508

(cougar roars)

336
00:36:05,833 --> 00:36:07,477
(cougar roars)

337
00:36:11,298 --> 00:36:12,729

(raccoon squeaks)

344
00:36:31,991 --> 00:36:34,378
- [Narrator] Old Man Cougar
didn't care for this business

345
00:36:34,403 --> 00:36:36,958
of being jabbed with a sharp stick.

346
00:36:40,373 --> 00:36:42,490
(crow squawks)

347
00:36:46,398 --> 00:36:47,525
- Thanks for your help.

348
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,320
(peaceful music)

349
00:36:50,662 --> 00:36:52,125
Hey, that tickles.

350
00:36:52,257 --> 00:36:53,757
(crow squawks)

351
00:36:58,821 --> 00:36:59,932
(raccoon squeaks)

352
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,247
Sweet William?

353
00:37:08,366 --> 00:37:11,563
(upbeat banjo music)

354
00:37:12,777 --> 00:37:14,698
Thanks to you too, Sweet William.

355
00:37:27,123 --> 00:37:28,586
(crow squawks)

356
00:38:33,575 --> 00:38:35,979
- [Narrator] Sweet William
just remembered that his momma

357
00:38:36,004 --> 00:38:39,690
had taught him those things
swimmin' were good to eat.

358
00:39:01,518 --> 00:39:03,212
- By golly, you did it.

359
00:39:06,436 --> 00:39:09,172
You're not a bad fisherman, Sweet William.

360
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:35,132
(upbeat piano music)

361
00:39:35,508 --> 00:39:36,630
(raccoon squeaks)

362
00:39:53,205 --> 00:39:54,001
Here!

363
00:39:54,026 --> 00:39:55,520
Raccoons gotta eat, too.

364
00:40:10,179 --> 00:40:12,000
(crow squawks)

365
00:40:13,246 --> 00:40:15,226
- [Narrator] Katie yelled down, "Hey!

366
00:40:15,251 --> 00:40:17,126
"What about me?"

367
00:40:28,083 --> 00:40:29,759
(crow squawks)

368
00:40:35,587 --> 00:40:36,639
Not bad.

369
00:40:36,979 --> 00:40:38,720
Not bad at all.

370
00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:42,916
(crow squawks)

371
00:41:07,695 --> 00:41:11,208
(raccoon squeaks)

372
00:41:40,017 --> 00:41:41,645
- Sweet William?

373
00:41:44,468 --> 00:41:45,944
Sweet William!

374
00:41:50,411 --> 00:41:52,215
Hey, bear!

375
00:42:22,017 --> 00:42:23,402
(raccoon squeaks)
(crow squawks)

376
00:42:31,142 --> 00:42:32,901
Sweet William!

377
00:42:43,726 --> 00:42:45,836
(playful organ music)

378
00:42:46,024 --> 00:42:47,501
- [Narrator] Sweet William had, of course,

379
00:42:47,526 --> 00:42:49,615
heard Starbird calling,

380
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:51,714
but he was having such a good time,

381
00:42:51,739 --> 00:42:54,091
he just couldn't be bothered right now.

382
00:43:16,267 --> 00:43:17,712
Well, well!

383
00:43:17,857 --> 00:43:18,887
Hello there!

384
00:43:19,304 --> 00:43:21,415
You look like an interesting fella!

385
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,393
Wanna wrestle?

386
00:43:24,956 --> 00:43:27,894
Phew, no wonder he's in the creek.

387
00:43:28,221 --> 00:43:30,810
That fella really needs a bath.

388
00:43:57,078 --> 00:43:59,732
(raccoon squeaks)

389
00:44:22,029 --> 00:44:23,335
- Sweet William!

390
00:44:23,555 --> 00:44:25,173
Come on down, Sweet William!

391
00:44:38,054 --> 00:44:39,594
Hold everything!

392
00:44:58,155 --> 00:45:00,234
- [Narrator] Roger was disgusted.

393
00:45:00,434 --> 00:45:04,416
Let that dumb bear get
down the best way he can.

394
00:45:04,786 --> 00:45:08,534
Starbird, you're gonna fall
and hurt yourself again!

395
00:45:08,983 --> 00:45:11,381
Careful, Starbird.

396
00:45:33,381 --> 00:45:34,559
Easy.

397
00:45:34,713 --> 00:45:35,796
Easy.

398
00:45:45,764 --> 00:45:47,418
(crow squawks)

399
00:46:15,567 --> 00:46:17,255
(raccoon squeaks)

400
00:46:22,646 --> 00:46:23,420
(crow squawks)

401
00:46:30,012 --> 00:46:30,737
(raccoon squeaks)

402
00:46:40,904 --> 00:46:41,956
(raccoon squeaks)

403
00:46:49,871 --> 00:46:51,361
- Oh, not again.

404
00:46:51,435 --> 00:46:52,823
Hey, Sweet William!

405
00:46:52,906 --> 00:46:54,231
Hold on there!

406
00:46:54,926 --> 00:46:57,061
- [Narrator] Suddenly
it dawned on Starbird

407
00:46:57,086 --> 00:47:00,093
that Sweet William was
trying to lead him somewhere.

408
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:02,108
That the bear must know of a place

409
00:47:02,133 --> 00:47:03,820
he wanted Starbird to see.

410
00:47:22,899 --> 00:47:27,899
(joyful music)

411
00:47:44,587 --> 00:47:45,947
(raccoon squeaks)

412
00:47:47,436 --> 00:47:49,520
(peaceful atmospheric music)

413
00:47:53,999 --> 00:47:56,271
- Hm, what do ya know?

414
00:48:18,904 --> 00:48:21,464
Sure would like to go up that
mountain and look around.

415
00:48:27,789 --> 00:48:31,172
Well, Sweet William, it
looks like a long way around.

416
00:48:31,725 --> 00:48:32,900
You feel like comin' along?

417
00:48:35,286 --> 00:48:36,556
(Sweet William growls)

418
00:48:38,709 --> 00:48:40,268
Okay, come on.

419
00:48:59,152 --> 00:49:01,460
There's gotta be an
easier way to get there.

420
00:49:01,705 --> 00:49:03,042
(raccoon squeaks)

421
00:49:05,522 --> 00:49:06,923
You comin' too, little raccoon?

422
00:49:14,261 --> 00:49:16,639
You may have an idea there, little fella.

423
00:49:25,112 --> 00:49:26,833
What do ya think, Sweet William?

424
00:49:28,078 --> 00:49:31,074
Ain't gonna be easy,
maybe even impossible,

425
00:49:31,099 --> 00:49:32,958
but it's worth a try.

426
00:49:59,387 --> 00:50:00,287
(crow squawks)

427
00:50:03,425 --> 00:50:04,125
(crow squawks)

428
00:50:05,212 --> 00:50:06,562
Where'd you come from?

429
00:50:06,682 --> 00:50:08,182
(crow squawks)

430
00:50:21,315 --> 00:50:26,356
(joyful music)

431
00:50:54,921 --> 00:50:57,257
(raccoon squeaks)

432
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:04,734
- [Narrator] Starbird
discovered that building a raft

433
00:51:04,759 --> 00:51:07,839
with one hand is one heck of a job.

434
00:51:08,094 --> 00:51:10,034
(Starbird groans)

435
00:51:21,290 --> 00:51:22,082
(crow squawks)

436
00:51:36,693 --> 00:51:38,303
(raccoon squeaks)

437
00:52:05,414 --> 00:52:07,033
- All right, all aboard.

438
00:52:10,199 --> 00:52:12,901
- [Narrator] Starbird had a
lot more confidence in his raft

439
00:52:12,926 --> 00:52:15,874
than Roger who eyed it suspiciously.

440
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:18,312
"It'll never make it," he thought.

441
00:52:18,572 --> 00:52:20,898
"We'll end up swimming
for our lives."

442
00:52:21,956 --> 00:52:23,990
- Come on, Sweet William.

443
00:52:34,095 --> 00:52:35,924
(raccoon squeaks)

444
00:52:39,764 --> 00:52:41,764
(peaceful music)

445
00:52:49,575 --> 00:52:51,579
- [Narrator] Easy, you big lama.

446
00:52:51,604 --> 00:52:53,729
You'll sink us before we get started.

447
00:52:55,595 --> 00:52:57,204
That's right, stupid.

448
00:52:57,590 --> 00:53:01,249
Fall off and tear the boat
up trying to get back aboard.

449
00:53:35,468 --> 00:53:39,007
Back ashore, Bandini
watched them head out,

450
00:53:39,032 --> 00:53:42,615
then tore off around the lake
to meet 'em on the other side.

451
00:54:07,198 --> 00:54:10,301
(raccoon squeaks)

452
00:54:10,697 --> 00:54:13,126
- Sit down, you two,
you're rockin' the boat.

453
00:54:29,261 --> 00:54:31,440
(creaking)

454
00:54:34,476 --> 00:54:36,392
(raccoon squeaks)

455
00:54:47,092 --> 00:54:49,888
(Sweet William growls)
(suspenseful music)

456
00:54:54,285 --> 00:54:56,273
Hang on, Sweet William!

457
00:54:59,538 --> 00:55:00,667
Hang on!

458
00:55:02,177 --> 00:55:03,618
I'm coming!

459
00:55:12,032 --> 00:55:13,972
Don't jump, Sweet William!

460
00:55:17,779 --> 00:55:18,971
Stay!

461
00:55:19,274 --> 00:55:20,761
Hang on, Sweet William!

462
00:55:24,004 --> 00:55:26,105
Crazy bear.

463
00:55:27,683 --> 00:55:29,573
(raccoon squeaks)

464
00:55:48,176 --> 00:55:51,780
(upbeat music)

465
00:56:10,865 --> 00:56:14,205
- [Narrator] Sweet William
was amazed, delighted,

466
00:56:14,230 --> 00:56:16,413
and a little bit frightened of the snow.

467
00:56:16,826 --> 00:56:20,853
It was fun to run and slide
on, and it didn't taste bad.

468
00:56:21,163 --> 00:56:25,830
(suspenseful music)

469
00:56:29,512 --> 00:56:31,252
(guns fire)

470
00:56:34,647 --> 00:56:36,689
He'd never heard a gun before,

471
00:56:36,714 --> 00:56:39,589
but he didn't need anybody
to tell him it meant danger.

472
00:56:51,793 --> 00:56:54,235
- How could you miss a bear in close?

473
00:56:55,325 --> 00:56:57,273
- 'Cause he ducked, that's why.

474
00:56:57,693 --> 00:56:58,877
Which way did he go?

475
00:56:59,031 --> 00:57:00,130
- That'a way.

476
00:57:01,914 --> 00:57:03,664
- I'll get him the next time.

477
00:57:12,347 --> 00:57:14,090
(xylophone glissando)

478
00:57:16,212 --> 00:57:20,046
(joyful music)

479
00:57:26,256 --> 00:57:28,406
- [Narrator] When
Starbird saw the hunters,

480
00:57:28,431 --> 00:57:31,333
he knew Sweet William
was in deadly danger.

481
00:57:41,586 --> 00:57:44,976
Starbird's first thought
was to distract the hunters

482
00:57:45,001 --> 00:57:48,376
from Sweet William and give
him a chance to get away.

483
00:57:50,592 --> 00:57:51,574
(wood snaps)

484
00:57:51,864 --> 00:57:53,627
(suspenseful piano music)

485
00:58:01,647 --> 00:58:03,068
(raccoon squeaks)

486
00:58:30,993 --> 00:58:34,362
(sliding whistle)

487
00:58:36,436 --> 00:58:37,878
- Hey, it's over here!

488
00:58:45,846 --> 00:58:48,926
(playful music)

489
00:58:51,424 --> 00:58:52,278
- No!

490
00:58:52,692 --> 00:58:53,878
He's over here.

491
00:59:22,351 --> 00:59:24,953
- [Narrator] Roger got
the idea from Starbird,

492
00:59:24,978 --> 00:59:27,520
and decided he'd do a
little distracting, too.

493
00:59:27,995 --> 00:59:28,922
(wood cracks)

494
00:59:29,783 --> 00:59:30,908
- What was that?

495
00:59:32,827 --> 00:59:34,868
(suspenseful piano music)

496
01:00:10,234 --> 01:00:10,934
(thud)

497
01:00:15,003 --> 01:00:16,744
- I could have swore I seen him.

498
01:00:17,305 --> 01:00:19,735
- Well he ain't here,
that's for darn sure.

499
01:00:20,708 --> 01:00:23,081
Sure is a small one for all this trouble.

500
01:00:23,106 --> 01:00:25,022
- Them's the best eatin'.

501
01:00:25,865 --> 01:00:27,369
- That's right.

502
01:00:28,350 --> 01:00:29,968
(upbeat piano music)

503
01:00:36,997 --> 01:00:38,067
(crow squawks)

504
01:00:38,861 --> 01:00:40,343
What you jumpin' for? (laughs)

505
01:00:40,476 --> 01:00:41,417
- Who's jumpin'?

506
01:00:41,591 --> 01:00:43,560
- It's just an old crow, that's all.

507
01:00:43,585 --> 01:00:45,169
- I know it!

508
01:01:04,035 --> 01:01:05,520
There he is!
- There he is!

509
01:01:05,849 --> 01:01:07,391
(guns fire)

510
01:01:08,473 --> 01:01:10,575
- (laughs) I think I winged him!

511
01:01:10,752 --> 01:01:12,031
- Come on!

512
01:01:25,127 --> 01:01:28,303
You missed him clean, he's
done gone and give us the slip.

513
01:01:29,934 --> 01:01:32,267
- I swear I seen him
start up that mountain.

514
01:01:32,416 --> 01:01:34,718
- Well he ain't gonna make time climbin'.

515
01:01:34,977 --> 01:01:36,718
- Well there's some snow up there.

516
01:01:36,898 --> 01:01:38,648
He'll be leavin' tracks, more than likely.

517
01:01:39,049 --> 01:01:40,489
- Let's go for it.

518
01:01:50,958 --> 01:01:54,581
(upbeat blues music)

519
01:02:39,861 --> 01:02:42,539
Ain't been up this far in quite a spell.

520
01:02:43,043 --> 01:02:45,062
- Seems a lot further than I thought.

521
01:02:45,563 --> 01:02:47,813
Ain't much further to the timber line.

522
01:02:48,335 --> 01:02:50,333
He'll be easier to track in the open.

523
01:02:50,406 --> 01:02:53,883
- Yeah, if it doesn't get
dark before we get there.

524
01:03:04,543 --> 01:03:05,784
- Sweet William!

525
01:03:07,171 --> 01:03:08,587
Little raccoon!

526
01:03:32,205 --> 01:03:33,900
(raccoon squeaks)

527
01:03:35,143 --> 01:03:37,287
I was beginning to think I'd lost you.

528
01:03:49,547 --> 01:03:51,616
When I was a kid on the
reservation, we used to gather

529
01:03:51,641 --> 01:03:53,127
them nuts by the bushel.

530
01:03:53,768 --> 01:03:56,637
We'd sell 'em for uh, a few pennies.

531
01:03:57,427 --> 01:03:59,284
Indian nuts, they called 'em.

532
01:04:00,128 --> 01:04:02,041
They were darn good eatin', too.

533
01:04:02,219 --> 01:04:04,269
(raccoon squeaks)

534
01:04:04,779 --> 01:04:05,887
(crow squawks)

535
01:04:10,608 --> 01:04:12,749
(crow squawks)

536
01:04:20,592 --> 01:04:24,649
(joyful piano music)

537
01:04:31,107 --> 01:04:34,162
- Hey, here's a print, real clear, too.

538
01:04:35,605 --> 01:04:36,896
- Here's another one over here.

539
01:04:38,154 --> 01:04:39,858
Can't see how we can miss him now.

540
01:04:39,984 --> 01:04:41,484
That bear's up on this mountain.

541
01:04:41,577 --> 01:04:42,841
- Yeah, sure seems like it.

542
01:04:42,938 --> 01:04:44,146
Only one thing, though.

543
01:04:44,678 --> 01:04:47,346
- What?
- Gonna be gettin' dark before long,

544
01:04:47,371 --> 01:04:49,491
and I ain't aimin' to get
caught up here in the night.

545
01:04:49,647 --> 01:04:52,108
- You mean, you gonna let
that critter get away,

546
01:04:52,133 --> 01:04:54,159
after all that climbin' we done?

547
01:04:56,289 --> 01:04:58,113
- Them prints will still
be here in the mornin'.

548
01:04:58,163 --> 01:05:00,025
So will the bear.
- Well I don't know.

549
01:05:00,450 --> 01:05:02,938
- We'll come back up here
first thing after sun's up.

550
01:05:03,435 --> 01:05:05,745
Gets mighty cold up here after dark.

551
01:05:06,410 --> 01:05:08,643
- Well, I don't know.

552
01:05:09,207 --> 01:05:10,624
I sure would hate to lose that cub

553
01:05:10,649 --> 01:05:12,613
after all the work we been to.

554
01:05:14,451 --> 01:05:16,178
Maybe you got a point there, anyway.

555
01:05:16,727 --> 01:05:17,897
- Come on.

556
01:05:21,654 --> 01:05:23,029
Will you come on!

557
01:05:24,056 --> 01:05:26,456

noticed it more and more.

561
01:06:01,168 --> 01:06:04,761

no longer hiding from him,

562
01:06:04,786 --> 01:06:08,468
and that even the elusive
foxes now openly performed

563
01:06:08,493 --> 01:06:11,216
their courtship rights while he watched.

564
01:06:36,831 --> 01:06:39,231
(raccoon squeaks)

565
01:06:40,884 --> 01:06:42,683
- Sweet William!

566
01:06:45,188 --> 01:06:47,829
I was pretty darn sure I'd
seen the last of you, bear.

567
01:06:48,035 --> 01:06:49,692
Alive, anyway.

Those people were trying to kill you

in the open like that.

Grandfather, I...

629
01:13:28,401 --> 01:13:31,201
- [Narrator] Snug in the
cave with his friends,

630
01:13:31,226 --> 01:13:34,105
Starbird felt a closeness with the night.

631
01:13:34,783 --> 01:13:39,056
In the distance, a coyote
howled, like a lost devil child.

632
01:13:39,678 --> 01:13:42,003
And he heard the footfalls
of a mountain lion

633
01:13:42,028 --> 01:13:45,855
creeping softly across
the snow in the stillness.

634
01:13:46,834 --> 01:13:49,282
He thought of the mysteries of life.

635
01:13:49,498 --> 01:13:52,167
Of father sky and mother earth.

636
01:13:52,730 --> 01:13:55,772
And a feeling of
contentment came over him.

637
01:13:59,054 --> 01:14:01,497
- Go to sleep, you guys!

638
01:14:13,277 --> 01:14:18,277

(peaceful piano music)

640
01:15:30,862 --> 01:15:32,862
- [Bearded Hunter] Only
one way he could have gone.

641
01:15:32,932 --> 01:15:33,616
- Where?

642
01:15:33,682 --> 01:15:35,625
- Up, ya darned old fool!

643
01:15:35,963 --> 01:15:38,255
(upbeat blues music)

644
01:16:03,995 --> 01:16:04,758
Look!

645
01:16:06,936 --> 01:16:08,040
- I see him!

646
01:16:15,572 --> 01:16:16,603
- Is that him?

647
01:16:17,421 --> 01:16:18,901
- There he is!

648
01:16:21,909 --> 01:16:22,609
- Now.

649
01:16:22,720 --> 01:16:23,720
Now!

650
01:16:26,714 --> 01:16:28,459
- You're too darn slow.

651
01:16:30,596 --> 01:16:32,035
- Now.
Now.

652
01:16:32,725 --> 01:16:33,892
(gun fires)

653
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:45,837

(gun fires)
(crow squawks)

655
01:16:50,958 --> 01:16:52,488
Stand right where you are.

656
01:16:54,814 --> 01:16:56,899
- Just don't budge and
nobody's gonna get hurt.

657
01:16:57,214 --> 01:16:58,559
- Have you been followin' me?

658
01:16:58,894 --> 01:17:00,172
- That there bear.

659
01:17:02,270 --> 01:17:04,736
- His pelt's no good to
you, he's just a cub.

660
01:17:05,350 --> 01:17:08,267
- [Hunter] Those are the best
eatin' kind, eh, partner?

661
01:17:08,386 --> 01:17:10,122
- None better I know of.

662
01:17:14,434 --> 01:17:17,214
Kindly oblige us by stepping
aside there, Indian.

663
01:17:18,328 --> 01:17:19,063
- No.

664
01:17:19,201 --> 01:17:20,942
- We didn't aim to do no killin',

665
01:17:20,967 --> 01:17:22,545
human that is, but we can.

666
01:17:22,768 --> 01:17:24,310
- And sure enough will, too.

01:17:25,964 --> 01:17:27,047
(Sweet William growls)

668
01:17:28,542 --> 01:17:30,709
- Hold it, right there!

669
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:35,742
Drop those guns behind you.

670
01:17:36,566 --> 01:17:37,566
Slow.

671
01:17:43,732 --> 01:17:44,478
Now!

672
01:17:45,497 --> 01:17:47,548
Before I give you a load of this buckshot.

673
01:17:53,156 --> 01:17:55,127
Pick up the guns, boy.

674
01:18:02,510 --> 01:18:03,875
Empty the shells.

675
01:18:35,539 --> 01:18:37,779
Now look in their pockets and
make sure they got no more.

676
01:19:08,434 --> 01:19:12,333
(dissonant piano keys)

677
01:19:12,892 --> 01:19:13,663
Okay.

678
01:19:13,907 --> 01:19:16,749
Pick up your guns and get goin', you two.

679
01:19:17,708 --> 01:19:21,208
(upbeat blues music)

680
01:19:24,503 --> 01:19:26,548
(sliding whistle)

681
01:19:30,896 --> 01:19:32,517
(sliding whistle)

682
01:19:51,855 --> 01:19:54,055
- [Narrator] Good heavens, what was this?

683
01:19:54,082 --> 01:19:55,155
- Whoa.

684
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:04,091
- [Narrator] Sweet William had
already had enough excitement

685
01:20:04,116 --> 01:20:05,254
for one day.

686
01:20:05,425 --> 01:20:09,954
And now this great beast
with long ears showed up.

687
01:20:11,437 --> 01:20:12,180
- Howdy.

688
01:20:12,879 --> 01:20:13,785
- Hello.

689
01:20:14,043 --> 01:20:16,191
- I seen a bit of smoke
up here last night.

690
01:20:16,409 --> 01:20:18,097
Figured it might be a campfire.

691
01:20:18,398 --> 01:20:19,889
- Well, you figured right.

692
01:20:20,012 --> 01:20:21,612
- [Ranger] Decided I better take a look.

693
01:20:22,189 --> 01:20:25,720
- Well, it's a good thing for us you did.

694
01:20:26,652 --> 01:20:28,028
- Indian, ain't ya?

695
01:20:28,472 --> 01:20:29,321
- Yes.

696
01:20:29,589 --> 01:20:31,065
They call my Starbird.

697
01:20:32,517 --> 01:20:34,422
- Ain't often I get to
see another human being.

698
01:20:34,912 --> 01:20:36,080
- No, I guess not.

699
01:20:36,933 --> 01:20:38,114
- Name's Mattie.

700
01:20:38,470 --> 01:20:39,993
- Nice to meet ya, Mattie.

701
01:20:40,970 --> 01:20:42,219
- I best be goin'.

702
01:20:42,380 --> 01:20:43,714
I got other things to do.

703
01:20:47,134 --> 01:20:49,313
You can come along if you mind to.

704
01:20:49,338 --> 01:20:51,006
You're welcome.

705
01:20:52,038 --> 01:20:53,413
- Don't mind if I do.

706
01:20:58,663 --> 01:21:00,319
Come on, you two.

707
01:21:00,771 --> 01:21:02,825
(upbeat piano music)

708
01:21:27,547 --> 01:21:28,367
(crow squawks)

709
01:21:33,096 --> 01:21:36,012
- You Indians sure got
a way with critters.

710
01:21:36,430 --> 01:21:38,268
- Animals are our friends.

711
01:21:39,808 --> 01:21:42,255
- That be your airplane
down there in the valley?

712
01:21:43,711 --> 01:21:44,417
- No.

713
01:21:44,750 --> 01:21:45,907
- Just thought I'd ask.

714
01:21:57,798 --> 01:21:59,172
- Not that plane!

715
01:22:01,016 --> 01:22:04,194
What I mean is, I don't actually own it,

716
01:22:04,219 --> 01:22:06,116
but I sort of borrowed it.

717
01:22:06,862 --> 01:22:08,115
- You stole it.

718
01:22:08,260 --> 01:22:09,551
- Well I meant to bring it back.

719
01:22:11,439 --> 01:22:13,810
I know it was a crazy thing to do,

720
01:22:13,835 --> 01:22:16,483
but I just wanted to fly so bad,

721
01:22:16,508 --> 01:22:18,312
and I really did mean to bring it back.

722
01:22:18,538 --> 01:22:21,116
- They'll be comin' for ya
on account of that airplane.

723
01:22:21,471 --> 01:22:24,221
Ain't gonna be easy to make
them believe what you say.

724
01:22:24,354 --> 01:22:25,428
- I know.

725
01:22:27,132 --> 01:22:29,132
- Got me a trap somewhere.

726
01:22:29,829 --> 01:22:30,909
- A trap?

727
01:22:33,153 --> 01:22:34,213
- It's humane.

728
01:22:34,383 --> 01:22:35,466
Instant kill.

729
01:22:36,206 --> 01:22:37,831
Legal.

730
01:22:40,791 --> 01:22:42,063
- You know, I could have
gotten myself killed

731
01:22:42,088 --> 01:22:45,741
doin' what I did, but I
think it was worth the risk,

732
01:22:45,766 --> 01:22:47,132
'cause I learned somethin'.

733
01:22:47,627 --> 01:22:49,232
Somethin' I won't soon forget.

734
01:22:49,536 --> 01:22:52,693
I found out why my forefathers
loved the land they lived on.

735
01:22:53,532 --> 01:22:55,494
They had to struggle hard to survive but,

736
01:22:55,519 --> 01:22:56,768
they were happy doing it.

737
01:22:57,289 --> 01:22:58,914
I think I know why now.

738
01:23:01,583 --> 01:23:02,283
- Huh.

739
01:23:03,122 --> 01:23:05,397
Ain't even touched the bait.

740
01:23:07,431 --> 01:23:09,348
No tracks neither.

741
01:23:09,930 --> 01:23:11,534
- Maybe there aren't
as many animals around

742
01:23:11,559 --> 01:23:12,536
as there used to be.

743
01:23:12,796 --> 01:23:14,867
- Person's got a right
to try to make a livin'.

744
01:23:15,279 --> 01:23:16,145
- By killin'?

745
01:23:16,287 --> 01:23:17,472
- Ain't stealin'!

746
01:23:18,061 --> 01:23:19,315
Come on, baby.

747
01:23:22,740 --> 01:23:23,606
- No.

748
01:23:24,452 --> 01:23:27,346
(somber acoustic guitar music)

749
01:23:28,829 --> 01:23:31,249
- [Mattie] Ain't likely to
go easy on you, Starbird.

750
01:23:31,666 --> 01:23:32,806
- [Starbird] I know.

751
01:23:33,080 --> 01:23:35,539
- [Mattie] A man can hide
from the law just so long,

752
01:23:35,564 --> 01:23:37,051
even in these mountains.

753
01:23:37,227 --> 01:23:38,503
And then what?

754
01:23:38,856 --> 01:23:40,731
- [Starbird] I don't know,
Mattie, I just don't know.

755
01:23:40,797 --> 01:23:42,002
I'm not a criminal.

756
01:23:42,327 --> 01:23:43,887
- [Mattie] The law could say different.

757
01:23:44,139 --> 01:23:45,765
- [Starbird] You know, when I
crashed that plane, I was just

758
01:23:45,790 --> 01:23:47,916
glad to be alive, all I wanted was just to

759
01:23:47,941 --> 01:23:49,773
get down the hill.

760
01:23:50,150 --> 01:23:52,703
After three days, I'm not
so sure I ever wanna leave.

761
01:23:53,461 --> 01:23:56,836
- Well, better make up your mind, boy.

762
01:23:57,609 --> 01:23:59,877
That way will take you down the mountain.

763
01:24:00,738 --> 01:24:03,530
And that way will take you
back up into the woods.

764
01:24:03,965 --> 01:24:05,283
It's up to you.

765
01:24:12,165 --> 01:24:17,165
(peaceful orchestral music)

766
01:24:25,248 --> 01:24:26,666
- Thanks, Mattie.

767
01:24:31,088 --> 01:24:32,262
(raccoon squeaks)

768
01:24:36,349 --> 01:24:37,484
(raccoon squeaks)

769
01:24:41,515 --> 01:24:42,449
(laughs)

770
01:24:48,239 --> 01:24:49,822
Goodbye, little raccoon.

771
01:24:49,915 --> 01:24:51,456
(raccoon squeaks)

772
01:25:03,484 --> 01:25:05,389
Now Sweet William, you
stay here with Mattie.

773
01:25:05,448 --> 01:25:06,887
(Sweet William growls)

774
01:25:07,047 --> 01:25:08,364
I'll miss ya but don't worry

775
01:25:08,389 --> 01:25:09,789
'cause I'll be back, Sweet William.

776
01:25:27,335 --> 01:25:30,620
- Well, I was wonderin'
about you, Bandini.

777
01:25:36,728 --> 01:25:37,982
(crow squawks)

778
01:25:38,581 --> 01:25:39,795
(crow squawks)

779
01:25:44,736 --> 01:25:46,024
- How will I find you, Mattie?

780
01:25:46,322 --> 01:25:47,948
- Don't you worry, Starbird.

781
01:25:48,261 --> 01:25:49,712
We'll find you when you come back.

782
01:26:13,086 --> 01:26:16,096
- [Starbird Voiceover] When
I have forgotten my pride,

783
01:26:16,121 --> 01:26:20,015
when I am filled with love
for all your creatures,

784
01:26:20,040 --> 01:26:22,796
lead me, oh father sky.

785
01:26:23,827 --> 01:26:26,761
In your love I shall grow, o ancient one,

786
01:26:26,786 --> 01:26:28,865
until hatred disappears.

787
01:26:29,683 --> 01:26:32,867
Until all envy and
jealous and petty thoughts

788
01:26:32,892 --> 01:26:34,910
are blown away,

789
01:26:34,935 --> 01:26:37,692
as the wind blows the
mists from the valley.

790
01:26:38,956 --> 01:26:42,456
I was weak, but now you've made me strong.

791
01:26:43,479 --> 01:26:46,308
I was proud, but now I shall be humble.

792
01:26:47,695 --> 01:26:50,460
I was filled with bad thoughts,

793
01:26:50,485 --> 01:26:53,806
but now they shall be gone forever,

794
01:26:53,831 --> 01:26:57,081
as a youth leaves the ways of childhood,

795
01:26:57,106 --> 01:26:59,126
