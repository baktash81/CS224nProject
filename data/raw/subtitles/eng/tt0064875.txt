I would say.

How could you hoodwink me like
this about Mrs. Satterfield?

1205
01:09:03,686 --> 01:09:05,973
It wasn't a lie, exactly.

1206
01:09:06,307 --> 01:09:08,040
Not a black one anyway.

1207
01:09:08,460 --> 01:09:11,004
Gray. Dark gray, Pa says.

1208
01:09:11,186 --> 01:09:12,347
Where is he?

1209
01:09:12,387 --> 01:09:14,549
At the butcher's getting
the turkey for tomorrow.

1210
01:09:14,589 --> 01:09:16,319
Oh, Theo, you've got to see it.

1211
01:09:16,358 --> 01:09:18,350
Thirty pounds! The biggest
turkey in the whole--

1212
01:09:18,393 --> 01:09:19,604
Sterling, stop trying
to change the subject.

1213
01:09:19,628 --> 01:09:21,494
A fellow
owed Pa some money, see?

1214
01:09:21,530 --> 01:09:23,795
Sterling North, answer me!

1216
01:09:26,701 --> 01:09:29,102
It was my fault.

1217
01:09:29,137 --> 01:09:32,665
I should have told you.

1218
01:09:32,707 --> 01:09:35,643
We just couldn't do it.

1219
01:09:35,677 --> 01:09:38,044
Why not?

1220
01:09:38,330 --> 01:09:42,173
What is so difficult
about hiring a housekeeper?

1221
01:09:43,259 --> 01:09:46,546
Sterling, I'm talking to you.

1222
01:09:47,225 --> 01:09:49,791
What's so awful
about Mrs. Satterfield?

1223
01:09:49,875 --> 01:09:53,209
She's a perfectly nice,
clean, respectable lady.

1224
01:09:53,428 --> 01:09:56,421
What is so wrong with
having your meals on time?

1225
01:09:56,465 --> 01:09:57,956
And your socks darned.

1226
01:09:57,999 --> 01:10:00,247
Maybe the furniture
polished once in awhile.

1227
01:10:00,296 --> 01:10:03,994
- Tell me!
- OK. OK, I'll tell you.

1228
01:10:04,058 --> 01:10:06,289
Because she wouldn't
be anything like Mom.

1229
01:10:06,327 --> 01:10:09,388
Or you, even.
That's what's wrong.

1230
01:10:10,865 --> 01:10:16,236
Well, Sterling, Mama's gone,
and I've got a job.

1231
01:10:16,270 --> 01:10:18,899
OK, so you've got a job.

1232
01:10:18,940 --> 01:10:21,307
It's easy for you
to sit in Chicago...

1233
01:10:21,342 --> 01:10:23,004
and write your letters.

1234
01:10:23,044 --> 01:10:25,275
But what about Pa and me?

1235
01:10:25,313 --> 01:10:28,511
Pa's gone half the time.

Mrs. Satterfield--

1237
01:10:32,019 --> 01:10:35,012
Do you know the first thing
that she wanted to do?

1238
01:10:35,056 --> 01:10:37,924
She wanted to kick out
Wowser and Rascal, too.

1239
01:10:37,959 --> 01:10:41,123
That's right.
Just--just--she hates animals.

1240
01:10:41,162 --> 01:10:44,030
She wanted to kick them out
like they were nothing.

1241
01:10:44,065 --> 01:10:46,159
Like--
like they didn't even matter.

1242
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:48,260
I see.

1243
01:10:48,302 --> 01:10:51,238
Soon as she came in here,
she was walking in...

1244
01:10:51,272 --> 01:10:53,468
putting her finger
all over mother's furniture...

1245
01:10:53,508 --> 01:10:56,808
saying, "Kick 'em out.
Animals aren't people."

1246
01:10:56,844 --> 01:10:58,005
Well, maybe they're not...

1247
01:10:58,045 --> 01:11:01,072
but they're not just animals
to me, Theo.

1248
01:11:01,115 --> 01:11:02,811
They're--they're--

1249
01:11:02,850 --> 01:11:04,375
Yeah.

1250
01:11:04,419 --> 01:11:07,651
I'm not gonna let anyone
kick them out.

1251
01:11:07,823 --> 01:11:09,621
Not anyone.

1252
01:11:10,375 --> 01:11:12,910
Hey, Sterling...

1253
01:11:13,845 --> 01:11:15,575

You know, there's a fella
down in Illinois--

1272
01:12:08,717 --> 01:12:11,118
Named McQuade. He owes you
real estate commission.

1273
01:12:11,153 --> 01:12:12,553
Gave you
the pick of the flock...

1274
01:12:12,588 --> 01:12:14,165

to be the biggest turkey...

1275

go down and pick him up...

Ice boats? The water won't
freeze over for a month.

1283
01:12:35,144 --> 01:12:37,875
Fine.
Take him out there and wait.

1284
01:12:42,551 --> 01:12:44,645

thinking too clearly.

is that somebody else

too eternally selfish...

responsible human being...

1310
01:13:47,616 --> 01:13:50,085
and give that boy
the father he deserves.

1311
01:13:50,119 --> 01:13:51,553
Now, you just wait a minute--

1312
01:13:51,587 --> 01:13:53,317
Papa, I won't wait!

1313
01:13:53,355 --> 01:13:55,483

to get said for once.

in going into all that.

to have to do your job.

[Snarls]

1376
01:18:34,410 --> 01:18:36,641
He bit me.

1377
01:18:39,248 --> 01:18:41,012
I'll get the iodine.

1378
01:18:45,988 --> 01:18:49,857
<i>MISS WHALEN: Sterling,
don't get too fond of him.</i>

1379
01:18:49,892 --> 01:18:51,918
<i>He won't al ways be young.</i>

1380
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:53,792
<i>There'll come a day
when old Mother Nature...</i>

1381
01:18:53,829 --> 01:18:57,664
<i>will reach across your shoulder
and tap his ear...</i>

1382
01:18:57,699 --> 01:19:00,635
<i>and he'll tell you
that it's time to go.</i>

1383
01:19:14,716 --> 01:19:16,685
Come here, son.

1384
01:19:21,590 --> 01:19:23,718
Take care of these bites.

1385
01:19:25,327 --> 01:19:30,322
He didn't mean it, Pa.
He just wants to ramble.

1386
01:19:32,501 --> 01:19:33,867
Hurt?

1387
01:19:33,902 --> 01:19:35,871
It just stings a little.

1388
01:19:35,904 --> 01:19:37,304
Hmm.

1389
01:19:40,676 --> 01:19:42,406
Pa?

1390
01:19:42,444 --> 01:19:45,346
Hmm?

1391
01:19:45,380 --> 01:19:47,906
I'm gonna have to let him go.

1392
01:19:54,223 --> 01:19:56,658
Well, that's the way it is,
Sterling.

1393
01:19:56,692 --> 01:19:59,662
Things change.

1394
01:19:59,695 --> 01:20:04,258
We can't always keep them
the way we'd like them to be.

1395
01:20:04,299 --> 01:20:06,632
We all have to grow up sometime.

1396
01:20:08,070 --> 01:20:10,301
Raccoons and boys, too.

1397
01:20:13,909 --> 01:20:15,935
Even fathers, I guess.

1398
01:20:18,747 --> 01:20:22,343
He'll ramble for a while.

1399
01:20:22,384 --> 01:20:25,548
That's just
some people's nature.

1400
01:20:25,587 --> 01:20:29,285
But he'll get over it.
He'll get over it.

1401
01:20:31,627 --> 01:20:36,531
He'll get smart, settle down.

1402
01:20:36,565 --> 01:20:40,161
Might even rent that little
office over Pringle's store.

her mysterious message.</i>

1407
01:21:05,583 --> 01:21:08,109

I had to take him back...</i>

1412
01:21:21,499 --> 01:21:24,628

almost bird-like.</i>

1414
01:21:26,170 --> 01:21:28,639

a little female...</i>

<i>chittering at us.</i>

1416
01:21:29,874 --> 01:21:34,175
<i>Not so much at me as at Rascal.</i>

1417
01:21:34,212 --> 01:21:38,445
<i>I wondered if he'd heard her,
half hoping he hadn't.</i>

1418
01:21:38,483 --> 01:21:40,475
<i>But it was soon clear
that he had.</i>

1419
01:21:40,518 --> 01:21:43,613
<i>He could hardly wait to land.</i>

1420

<i>STERLING: Though I was sorry
to see him go...</i>

1421
01:21:59,103 --> 01:22:03,564
<i>it helped to know he wouldn't
be alone in the world.</i>

1422
01:22:05,843 --> 01:22:09,143
<i>Just once he looked back
to see if I was still there...</i>

1423
01:22:10,949 --> 01:22:15,353
<i>I think he was sort of
saying good-bye.</i>
