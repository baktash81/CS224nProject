4 BATTLES TO FREEDOM

10

11
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:54,907
SAVE POINT: 414 METERS

12
00:02:29,233 --> 00:02:31,944
Take the fucking team back.

13
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:49,855
Turn me around.

14
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:09,833
Shit!

15
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:58,424
Good run, Kable.

16
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:03,178
- My name is Tillman.
- Whatever your name is,

17
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:06,473
- you got to the save point fast.
- Who the fuck cares?

18
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:07,850
No one is getting out of here alive.

19
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,893
I am. I'm gonna make it out.

20
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:11,562
Sure you will.

21
00:05:11,562 --> 00:05:14,648
They said you got 3 battles left
before you get out.

22
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:27,911
Bob!

23
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:29,455
Let me handle this.
Bob!

24
00:05:29,455 --> 00:05:31,790
- Do we have the interview or don't?
- Yes,

25
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,208
we are cunt hair close.

26
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:36,295
Look I'm not going to blow the
3 asian wars for close.

27
00:05:36,295 --> 00:05:39,340
With all do respect, Bob,
nobody cares about dead orientals.

28
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:42,801
- They care about Ken Castle.
- Can I hear it from Gina, please?

29
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:44,428
Okay, Bob...

30
00:05:45,888 --> 00:05:49,933
Bob, are you aware that Castle has clocked
exactly one media appearance state,

31
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:53,729
and that was Walter's last interview
before she died, that would be 9 fucking years ago!

32
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:57,691
Stop menstruating and just tell me
whether we fucking have it?

33
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,860
We fucking, have it.

34
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,487
Good!

35
00:06:03,906 --> 00:06:06,241
Okay, focus.
Let's get lunch.

36
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:07,951
Iranian, sushi or mexican?

37
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:09,870
Burger chili fried?

38
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,580
I could eat a burger.

39
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:15,584
We live in society.

40
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,087
We visit society.

41
00:06:19,463 --> 00:06:20,839
I mean,

42
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:23,968
which one, which one is
more real? Really?

43
00:06:23,968 --> 00:06:26,929
I mean, which one is really real?
You know what I mean?

44
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:35,521
<i>You're watching
Gina Parker Smith, alive!</i>

45
00:06:35,521 --> 00:06:38,524
<i>World link tonight exclusive!</i>

46
00:06:39,191 --> 00:06:41,151

off the charts.

47
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,903
You realize he could
buy the network.

48
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:44,530
Yeah, why would he?
The son of a bitch pulls

49
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:47,449
650 millions pay-per-views
for one single broadcast.

50
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:52,329
Going live in...
5... 4... 3... 2... 1...

51
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,166
First, there was "Society".

52
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,961
The ultimate sim environment,
where players don't control

53
00:06:58,961 --> 00:07:02,548
virtual animated characters,
but actual,

54
00:07:02,548 --> 00:07:05,175
living, breathing human beings.

55
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:09,138
They walked them, they talked them,
they juiced them, they rocked them.

56
00:07:10,222 --> 00:07:13,017
Rickidy dickidy doo.
We had that on t-shirts
back on 2010.

57
00:07:13,017 --> 00:07:15,394
The creation of reclusive genius
Ken Castle...

58
00:07:15,394 --> 00:07:17,146
"Who is Ken Castle?"

59
00:07:17,146 --> 00:07:19,231
"Society" took the
world by storm,

60
00:07:19,231 --> 00:07:22,234
becoming the number one guilty
pleasure of billions.

61
00:07:22,234 --> 00:07:25,070
You can get paid
to be controlled,

62
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:27,114
or you can pay to control.

63
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:30,284
And generating one of the world's
largest private fortunes,

64
00:07:30,326 --> 00:07:33,245
surpassing Bill Gates
practically, over night.

65
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:39,251
Nine months ago,
Castle availed a new simulation.

66
00:07:39,251 --> 00:07:44,131
One that would take gaming into new heights
of thrilling excess...

67
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:47,176
and controversy.

68
00:07:47,176 --> 00:07:48,594
SLAYERS

69
00:07:48,594 --> 00:07:52,348
Slayers, if "Society" let us
live through others,

70
00:07:52,348 --> 00:07:55,309
"Slayers" could let us
die through others.

71
00:07:55,309 --> 00:08:00,189
Slayers gives the gamer full control
of a flesh and blood human being,

72
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:02,358
in full scale
kill or be killed combat.

73
00:08:02,358 --> 00:08:04,652
And when we say "flesh and blood"

74
00:08:04,652 --> 00:08:09,073
We mean, flesh...
and blood.

75
00:08:17,206 --> 00:08:20,334
- Slayers.
- Slayers!

76
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:22,253
Why isn't it murder?

77
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:26,966
Gina, when was the last time you saw someone
volunteer to be murdered?

78
00:08:26,966 --> 00:08:31,011
I'm sure you know that every last one
of our Slayers is a bonified death row inmate.

79
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:33,514
Each one offered the chance to participate
as an alternative to their sentences.

80
00:08:33,514 --> 00:08:36,016
If you stay alive for 30 sessions,
you can get set free.

81
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:37,643
That's not a bad goddamn deal.

82
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:43,148
And has any of these men or women have
actually survived long enough to be set free?

83
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:46,944
Well I remind the audience that Slayers
was put together with a full cooperation

84
00:08:46,944 --> 00:08:49,154
and approval, of the United States
Federal government.

85
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:50,781
That the revenue that produces...

86
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:53,367
is responsible for funding
our entire prison system...

87
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:55,661
keeping the bad guys
behind bars.

88
00:08:55,661 --> 00:08:59,164
And that the prop was voted
for by a cock solid 68% of the american public.

89
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:02,042
In an election tainted by
a suspected digital fraud.

90
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:04,670
Let's talk about the
so called "genericons".

91
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,755
Sent into the Slayers environment,

92
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:10,843
With a set of pre programmed actions,
with no one controlling them,

93
00:09:10,843 --> 00:09:14,221
and no way to react, their chances
of survival next to nil?

94
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:17,349
There's plenty of men and women in prison
who can never cut it to Slayers

95
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:20,853
shouldn't they be given the same chance,
roll the dice for a ticket out?

96
00:09:20,853 --> 00:09:23,230
Besides they only need to survive
one session.

97
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,524
Right.

98
00:09:25,524 --> 00:09:27,651
So Mr. Castle,
how the hell does it work?

99
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:31,739
It begins with a single nano cell
planted in the motor cortex of the brain.

100
00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:35,034
This cell can replicate,

101
00:09:35,034 --> 00:09:37,328
replacing the cells around it
with perfect copies.

102
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:42,666
And these copied cells contain
remote access functionality.

103
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:45,628
Therefore nano plus cortex,
equals a "nanex".

104
00:09:45,628 --> 00:09:48,547
Is it true, that every human
that undergoes this procedure,

105
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:51,675
will have a distinct "ip" address,
like a mobile device...

106
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:53,677
- or a notebook computer?
- Similar, yes.

107
00:09:53,677 --> 00:09:57,640
But control is strictly localized
with the parameters of our gaming environment.

108
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,642
You take "Society" for instance.

109
00:09:59,642 --> 00:10:02,811
Once our cast member has left the workplace
they're completely free,

110
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:05,189
from the control and
monitoring of their player.

111
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:07,733
Oh well that's a relief!

112
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:09,735
For some, maybe.

113
00:10:09,735 --> 00:10:11,362
For some...

114
00:10:16,534 --> 00:10:20,412
Don't you suspect some folks wouldn't
mind a bit of controlling?

115
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:22,790
Someone else making all the
decisions for you?

116
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:27,753
No tough choices,
no responsibilities?

117
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:32,550
- Think about it.
- We will, Mr. Castle.

118
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:35,052
We will!

- Mr. Castle, we have no idea where this is...

00:16:18,354 --> 00:16:20,022
Why would anyone want my name?

172
00:16:20,022 --> 00:16:22,817
You don't even know what's
going on out there, do you?

173
00:16:22,817 --> 00:16:25,319
<i>All medical personal
report to central process.</i>

174
00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:27,280
- Damn, gotta go.
- No no! Wait,

175
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,116
How did you get this picture?
Have you seen them?

176
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:59,687
<i>Sweat baby sweat baby
sex is a Texas drought.</i>

177
00:16:59,687 --> 00:17:03,190
<i>Me and you do the kind of stuff
only Prince would sing about</i>

178
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:07,570
<i>So put your hands down my pants
and you'll be feeling nuts</i>

179
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:09,572
<i>Yes I'm Siskel,
yes I'm Ebert</i>

180
00:17:09,572 --> 00:17:11,866
<i>and you're getting
two thumbs up</i>

181
00:17:11,866 --> 00:17:14,285
<i>Come quicker than FedEx never reach an apex,
just like Coca-Cola stock you are inclined,</i>

182
00:17:14,285 --> 00:17:16,203
<i>To make me rise an hour early</i>

183
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:19,206
<i>just like Daylight Savings Timeo</i>

184
00:17:19,206 --> 00:17:22,793
<i>You and me baby
ain't nothin' but mammals</i>

185
00:17:22,793 --> 00:17:26,923
<i>So let's do it like they do
on the Discovery Channell. Do it again now.</i>

186
00:17:26,923 --> 00:17:30,468
<i>You and me baby ain't nothin' but mammals
So let's do it</i>

187
00:17:30,468 --> 00:17:34,305
<i>like they do on the Discovery Channel
Gettin' horny now</i>

188
00:18:03,793 --> 00:18:08,464
- Hey.
- Hi.

189
00:18:09,465 --> 00:18:11,092
So what's your damage?

190
00:18:14,971 --> 00:18:18,849
You know, just hanging out.
Just looking to meet people.

191
00:18:18,849 --> 00:18:21,102
...meet people.

192
00:18:21,102 --> 00:18:24,397
Lucky you. You met me.

193
00:18:30,486 --> 00:18:36,450
- I'm Nika.
- I'm Dale. I like your fur.

194
00:18:37,451 --> 00:18:41,455
- Do you wanna go somewhere?
- Do you wanna go somewhere?

195
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:46,335
We are somewhere.

196
00:19:12,778 --> 00:19:18,117
<i>Ken Castle...Is a liar.
Liar!</i>

197
00:19:18,784 --> 00:19:20,536
Fuck!

198
00:19:20,536 --> 00:19:23,122
<i>A new video prank by
the subversive group Humanz...</i>

199
00:19:23,122 --> 00:19:25,541
<i>caused a nation wide
stir today.</i>

200
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:29,378
<i>All contact between "Society" city, and
an estimated 3 quarters of a million players</i>

201
00:19:29,378 --> 00:19:32,590
<i>were shut down for 3 hours
while Castle technicians</i>

202
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:37,011
<i>were working on what they described as
a "satellite infection"...</i>

203
00:19:37,011 --> 00:19:40,348
<i>These pranks, at first,
attributed to rogue isolated hackers </i>

204
00:19:40,348 --> 00:19:44,060
<i>are now suspected to be the work of
an elaborate and sophisticated,</i>

205
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:47,647
<i>network of programming cells,
spread around several countries.</i>

206
00:19:47,647 --> 00:19:49,732
<i>Experts estimate that the service interruption</i>

207
00:19:49,732 --> 00:19:53,194
<i>will end up costing Castle
billions in lost revenue.</i>

208
00:19:53,194 --> 00:19:55,446
<i>Well don't cry for Castle,
he can cover this with</i>

209
00:19:55,446 --> 00:19:57,782
<i>change in his couch cushions.</i>

210
00:19:57,782 --> 00:20:00,201
<i>On a personal note,
that shit was fucked up.</i>

211
00:20:00,201 --> 00:20:03,454
<i>Yeah it was.
I literally pissed myself.</i>

212
00:20:03,454 --> 00:20:05,248
<i>Sounds like fun.</i>

213
00:20:05,248 --> 00:20:09,085
<i>Seriously, these Humanz cock suckers,
they're are out of control.</i>

214
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:22,348
- Sandra.
- Quiet.

215
00:20:23,391 --> 00:20:28,813
- My name is Sandra.
- Stop talking.

216
00:23:14,103 --> 00:23:16,481
<i>They can't say
I didn't try...</i>

217
00:24:24,173 --> 00:24:25,800
Fuck yeah!

218
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:45,778
We're all going to die!

219
00:24:54,495 --> 00:24:56,622
Get me out of here!

220
00:24:58,041 --> 00:25:01,794
I'm not supposed to be here!

221
00:25:01,794 --> 00:25:05,256
Who are they?

222
00:25:05,256 --> 00:25:11,429
Who the fuck are they?
Who the fuck is playing us man?

223
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,818
Shut up, fish.

224
00:25:52,887 --> 00:25:57,934
Gay, gay, gay, tardily gay.

225
00:25:57,934 --> 00:25:59,727
- Swarmers.
- Swarmers.

226
00:25:59,727 --> 00:26:01,729
The latest innovation
from Browning,

227
00:26:01,729 --> 00:26:03,564
this self detonating cartridge...

228
00:26:03,564 --> 00:26:05,108
offers the widest
and deadliest spray available...

229
00:26:05,233 --> 00:26:06,901
from a full tracking, cornering coordinates.

230
00:26:06,901 --> 00:26:08,152
- Daddy like it.
- Simon!

231
00:26:08,152 --> 00:26:10,613
Fan girl, stop hacking me.

232
00:26:10,613 --> 00:26:13,866
You suck Simon. You're going to get
my boyfriend killed...

233
00:26:13,866 --> 00:26:17,036
before he gets out of jail and
before he can fill me up with his!

234
00:26:17,036 --> 00:26:18,746
Simon!
I just wanna play you.

235
00:26:18,746 --> 00:26:21,249
- Forget about that star fucker.
- Shut up bitch!

236
00:26:22,083 --> 00:26:24,460
So when am I going to get to meet you,
for like, real?

237
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:26,212
What's that?

238
00:26:26,921 --> 00:26:28,840
What's up looser?

239
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:31,259
Mum says: Go to college,
move the fuck out, and...

240
00:26:31,259 --> 00:26:33,845
Oh yeah! You're a sick retard!
You're pathetic.

241
00:26:33,886 --> 00:26:35,346
You smell like Jeffrey Dahmer.

242
00:26:35,346 --> 00:26:37,223
- Wanna make out?
- You wish.

243
00:26:37,223 --> 00:26:39,559
I can't wait until they
cut you out, Simian.

244
00:26:39,559 --> 00:26:40,560
Your balls bitch.

245
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,603
- Simon?
- Maybe.

246
00:26:41,603 --> 00:26:43,271
Oh my God! Is really you!

247
00:26:43,271 --> 00:26:47,317
- Nice.
- Do you want to see our tits, Simon?

248
00:26:47,317 --> 00:26:48,109
Yes, yes I do.

249
00:26:48,109 --> 00:26:52,488
Now that we have your attention, here's
an offer that you can't refuse.

250
00:26:52,488 --> 00:26:54,782
- Here we go.
- 50 million euros...

251
00:26:54,782 --> 00:26:56,284
for control of Kable.

252
00:26:56,284 --> 00:26:59,495
instant transfer to the account
of your choice.

253
00:26:59,495 --> 00:27:01,372
Kable is not for sale,
thank you.

254
00:27:01,372 --> 00:27:02,498
Baby, make a hundred...

255
00:27:02,498 --> 00:27:04,876
Spin the reel!

256
00:27:11,007 --> 00:27:13,718
What the fuck?

257
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:29,984
If you want to talk to Kable,
we can show you how.

258
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:39,535
Look at it.
The new face of Slayers.

259
00:27:39,535 --> 00:27:42,121
Pure, crystalized horror,

260
00:27:42,121 --> 00:27:45,333
two stories high and
bathed in bloody red.

261
00:27:45,333 --> 00:27:46,709
He is what they want.

262
00:27:46,709 --> 00:27:47,794
They love Kable.

263
00:27:47,794 --> 00:27:49,170
They do now,

264
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:52,382
but when they watch their hero die
right in front of their eye balls...

265
00:27:52,382 --> 00:27:53,883
so sharp and vivid...

266
00:27:53,883 --> 00:27:56,886
if feels like it could've reach out and
touch the wet flesh.

267
00:27:56,886 --> 00:28:01,391
They're going to change their point of view
Be seduced by the power.

268
00:28:01,391 --> 00:28:05,853
The violence, the dominance.
Is human nature.

269
00:28:05,853 --> 00:28:08,731
Kable made it to 28 battles, every
player in the game is going to take him out.

270
00:28:08,731 --> 00:28:10,817
Yeah, Kable is a perfect soldier,

271
00:28:10,817 --> 00:28:13,152
he's a tactical killing computer.

272
00:28:13,152 --> 00:28:17,949
His only vulnerability is
the nanex itself. The...

273
00:28:17,991 --> 00:28:19,826
delay between Simon's commands

274
00:28:19,826 --> 00:28:22,996
and Kable's ability to execute.

275
00:28:23,037 --> 00:28:25,164
So why should this one be any different?

276
00:28:25,164 --> 00:28:27,876
Who controls him?

277
00:28:31,713 --> 00:28:33,423
No one.

278
00:28:44,976 --> 00:28:47,186
Get it out of me!

279
00:29:07,081 --> 00:29:09,125
What the hell happened
to this one?

280
00:29:09,125 --> 00:29:11,252
Looks like he escaped.

281
00:29:15,465 --> 00:29:20,803
Hi girls. Back to your exercise.

282
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:32,982
That's Hackman,
Hackman, Hackman, knack man.

283
00:29:32,982 --> 00:29:35,568
They say he killed a
whole bunch of people, man.

284
00:29:35,568 --> 00:29:37,654
Killed himself all kinds of people.

285
00:29:38,655 --> 00:29:42,575
And then one day, he just walks up
and turns himself in...

286
00:29:42,575 --> 00:29:45,870
like he wants to be inside
or some crazy shit like that.

287
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:47,372
You know what I'm saying?

288
00:29:47,372 --> 00:29:49,958
So it's going to be all
kinds of Slayers, man.

289
00:29:49,958 --> 00:29:53,253
As long as you got motherfuckers like
that running around killing...

290
00:29:53,253 --> 00:29:57,465
Kable! Let's go!
Upgrades, come on.

291
00:29:59,968 --> 00:30:02,011
Why don't you upgrade
a brother man?

292
00:30:02,011 --> 00:30:04,514
Why don't you shut the fuck up?!

293
00:30:08,643 --> 00:30:11,479
Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up.

294
00:30:11,479 --> 00:30:14,065
Fucking, shut the fuck up.

295
00:30:41,259 --> 00:30:43,970
- Who wimps?
- What?

296
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:47,724
Who wimps,
the player or the slayer?

297
00:30:51,269 --> 00:30:57,108
Someone, somewhere else is the eye.

298
00:30:57,108 --> 00:30:59,319
It's tripped out, man.

299
00:30:59,319 --> 00:31:04,908
Sometimes, they take over.
Completely, they...

300
00:31:04,908 --> 00:31:07,702
move you around like a robot.

301
00:31:07,702 --> 00:31:11,080
- But that don't work so good.
- Why?

302
00:31:11,915 --> 00:31:13,625
The delay.

303
00:31:13,625 --> 00:31:17,253
Yeah the ping.
They talk about that.

304
00:31:17,253 --> 00:31:20,924
About how long it takes the
Slayer to respond to the command.

305
00:31:20,924 --> 00:31:23,343
Whatever they call it,

306
00:31:23,343 --> 00:31:28,640
the slice of a second out there,
is the difference between living and dying.

307
00:31:29,349 --> 00:31:32,143
When that trigger pulls...

308
00:31:36,856 --> 00:31:39,275
it's just me.

309
00:32:00,755 --> 00:32:02,424
Hey, Kable.

310
00:32:03,883 --> 00:32:06,010
Look.

311
00:32:06,803 --> 00:32:08,972
I just killed someone.

312
00:32:09,973 --> 00:32:12,350
This is the blood.

313
00:32:14,352 --> 00:32:15,979
Look.

314
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:21,776
He's back here.

315
00:32:21,776 --> 00:32:23,403
Wanna see?

316
00:32:25,697 --> 00:32:28,366
No your head
ain't working straight.

317
00:32:32,412 --> 00:32:35,623
I'm going to kill you too,
on sunday.

318
00:32:35,623 --> 00:32:36,958
Yeah, probably.

319
00:32:36,958 --> 00:32:38,960
That's why they put me here.

320
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,838
I got no strings.

321
00:32:41,838 --> 00:32:46,718
I got no strings,
so I have fun.

322
00:32:46,718 --> 00:32:50,597
I'm not tied up to anyone.

323
00:32:50,597 --> 00:32:55,143
They got strings,
but you can see,

324
00:32:55,977 --> 00:33:01,024
there are no strings on me.

325
00:33:01,024 --> 00:33:03,193
You go two whores, Kable.

326
00:33:03,943 --> 00:33:06,946
- What the fuck you said?
- Outside.

327
00:33:07,739 --> 00:33:12,035
I'm sorry,
I met your pretty girls.

328
00:33:13,244 --> 00:33:16,831
So you want to get back to them.

329
00:33:16,831 --> 00:33:19,250
But I'm going to visit them first.

330
00:33:31,471 --> 00:33:33,556
Alright.

331
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:41,856
Kable.

332
00:33:42,565 --> 00:33:47,028
Kable. Kable, dude. It's me.
It's me.

333
00:33:47,028 --> 00:33:48,196
Who?

334
00:33:48,196 --> 00:33:51,366
Simon, I'm playing you.

335
00:33:51,366 --> 00:33:55,328
- How come I can hear you?
- Well it's mud.

336
00:33:55,328 --> 00:33:57,789
Gamers can't talk to cons.

337
00:33:57,789 --> 00:33:59,416
I know.

338
00:34:00,208 --> 00:34:03,253
It's fucking unbelievable.
This is amazing.

339
00:34:19,853 --> 00:34:21,521
Cool yeah?

340
00:34:21,521 --> 00:34:23,314
No it's not cool.

341
00:34:24,274 --> 00:34:26,943
Pay attention to the fucking game!

342
00:34:34,701 --> 00:34:37,620
Okay, okay.
I got it, I got it.

343
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:38,955
What are you, 12?

344
00:34:38,955 --> 00:34:41,958
I'm 17 actually,
thank you.

345
00:34:47,797 --> 00:34:49,883
This is unbelievable.

346
00:34:49,883 --> 00:34:52,719
How am I not dead yeat?

347
00:34:52,761 --> 00:34:55,764
Cause I'm a badass,
motherfucker.

348
00:35:08,693 --> 00:35:10,695
Shit!

349
00:35:17,077 --> 00:35:21,247
Freek, you shouldn't be here.

350
00:35:42,102 --> 00:35:43,979
- Gibs.
- What?

351
00:35:43,979 --> 00:35:47,899
Like giblets. Chunks.
Pieces. Pieces everywhere.

352
00:35:47,899 --> 00:35:50,443
These are real humans fucker.

353
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:59,661
Death row, psychos...  so what?

354
00:35:59,661 --> 00:36:02,289
They had it coming anyway, right?

355
00:36:15,677 --> 00:36:17,846
I guess that goes for me too.

356
00:36:17,846 --> 00:36:19,931
Yeah, but you're different.

357
00:36:20,849 --> 00:36:22,934
Different, how?

358
00:36:22,934 --> 00:36:25,645
I don't know, because
you're in my side.

359
00:36:25,645 --> 00:36:28,523
Damn new area.

360
00:36:34,029 --> 00:36:37,365
Think about it Kable, all the shit
we've been through together,

361
00:36:37,365 --> 00:36:40,076
what an epic run, man.

362
00:36:40,076 --> 00:36:42,245
It's gonna suck to see it end.

363
00:36:42,245 --> 00:36:43,955
Are you fucking kidding me?

364
00:36:43,955 --> 00:36:47,459
Oh yeah, I get that for you is different.

365
00:36:50,879 --> 00:36:52,464
This way.

366
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,469
- There's nothing there.
- Trust me, kid.

367
00:36:57,469 --> 00:37:00,388
It's restricted area. It's beyond
the border of the game

368
00:37:00,388 --> 00:37:02,807
I couldn't put you there if I tried.

369
00:37:02,807 --> 00:37:03,892
Warning.

370
00:37:03,892 --> 00:37:05,518
Access denied.

371
00:37:12,943 --> 00:37:15,612
Very well.

372
00:37:16,446 --> 00:37:18,198
Shit.

373
00:37:30,585 --> 00:37:32,629
Bye, Kable.

374
00:37:45,767 --> 00:37:49,062
Come on.

375
00:37:49,062 --> 00:37:52,440
This kid will get me killed.

376
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,442
Dude I'm right here, man.
I can hear you.

377
00:37:54,442 --> 00:37:56,987
Listen to me.

378
00:37:56,987 --> 00:37:59,614
I don't know who's behind it or why,

379
00:37:59,614 --> 00:38:03,577
but I was supposed to die tonight.
Lucky for us,

380
00:38:03,577 --> 00:38:06,288
I can beat them...

381
00:38:06,288 --> 00:38:08,331
but not with you controlling me.

382
00:38:08,331 --> 00:38:10,000
What the hell are you talking about?

383
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:14,671
Turn me lose, kid.
You want to win? Turn me lose.

384
00:38:14,671 --> 00:38:16,506
Find a way.

385
00:38:17,799 --> 00:38:20,010
Bastard.

386
00:38:25,974 --> 00:38:30,770
So Ms Roth. Says here you're
applying for custody of your daughter?

387
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:33,356
Delia, her name is Delia.

388
00:38:34,149 --> 00:38:37,277
Spouse incarcerated, left without the possibility of parol.

389
00:38:37,277 --> 00:38:40,614
- You use your maiden name?
- huh-huh.

390
00:38:41,615 --> 00:38:43,992
My husband, is...

391
00:38:43,992 --> 00:38:47,245
it's not entirely true
regarding his sentence.

392
00:38:47,245 --> 00:38:49,581
In fact,
he's due to be released soon.

393
00:38:49,581 --> 00:38:53,919
Ms. Roth,
your husband was charged and...

394
00:38:56,087 --> 00:38:58,465
charged and convicted
of first degree murder,

395
00:38:58,465 --> 00:39:01,176
I can't hardly
consider his release,

396
00:39:01,176 --> 00:39:05,680
or if it happened at all..
I don't think it would be a good thing.

397
00:39:08,517 --> 00:39:10,644
So it's says you're an actor?

398
00:39:12,604 --> 00:39:15,315
I don't know that I've
seen you in anything.

399
00:39:15,315 --> 00:39:17,484
I work in "Society".

400
00:39:18,151 --> 00:39:20,070
It's a job.

401
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:22,822
Ms. Roth, your child has been exceedingly well placed,

402
00:39:22,822 --> 00:39:25,742
the new family is very wealthy,
she won't have to work for anything.

403
00:39:25,742 --> 00:39:28,787
Now I can understand that
you love your daughter.

404
00:39:28,787 --> 00:39:32,958
Probably very much. But do you really
think she would be better off...

405
00:39:32,958 --> 00:39:35,085
with...

406
00:39:35,085 --> 00:39:36,878
people like you?

407
00:39:38,296 --> 00:39:42,801
Yes, I do.
I'm her mother.

408
00:39:45,846 --> 00:39:49,724
We will give your application on
the consideration of merits.

409
00:40:13,582 --> 00:40:16,585
<b>Body armor purchased</b>

410
00:40:19,337 --> 00:40:20,922
Do you like the software?

411
00:40:20,922 --> 00:40:22,007
Software?

412
00:40:22,007 --> 00:40:23,967
The walkie talkie, player.

413
00:40:24,009 --> 00:40:25,594
No shit.

414
00:40:25,594 --> 00:40:28,889
You're the guy from the TV,
the Humanz.

415
00:40:28,889 --> 00:40:30,098
That's right, baby.

416
00:40:30,098 --> 00:40:32,309
You think about
what the brother said?

417
00:40:32,309 --> 00:40:34,394
What brother do you refer,
brother?

418
00:40:34,394 --> 00:40:37,105
Kable wants the freedom to ass kick.

419
00:40:37,105 --> 00:40:38,899
Do shit his way.

420
00:40:38,899 --> 00:40:41,359
- Are you going to give it to him?
- You were listening?

421
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:43,153
We see and hear everything...

422
00:40:43,153 --> 00:40:46,531
everything that goes on inside
that so called game.

423
00:40:46,531 --> 00:40:49,743
Alright then,
Kable said we got lucky...

424
00:40:49,743 --> 00:40:52,496
They were gunning for us.
What's that all about?

425
00:40:52,496 --> 00:40:54,664
Kable got a past,
he knows things.

426
00:40:54,664 --> 00:40:56,750
Things you don't even know.

427
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:59,711
- What things?
- Things that Castle is afraid of.

428
00:40:59,711 --> 00:41:03,799
As long as you boy stays on the him inside,
Castle knows he can keep him quiet.

429
00:41:03,799 --> 00:41:08,804
But if he ever got out... Castle
would never let that happen.

430
00:41:08,804 --> 00:41:10,055
There's one battle left,

431
00:41:10,055 --> 00:41:11,890
I think I can handle my own business,
thank you very much.

432
00:41:11,890 --> 00:41:13,600
You're not hearing me.

433
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:17,270
This is not something you can control.

434
00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:19,272
They're gonna kill his ass, Simon.

435
00:41:19,272 --> 00:41:21,525
In the eyes of the world,
and then what?

436
00:41:21,525 --> 00:41:25,946
You're just another poor
little rich honky.

437
00:41:25,946 --> 00:41:29,032
No cable, no pussy, no shit.

438
00:41:29,032 --> 00:41:34,913
Look man, this... this is too heavy. I don't
even know what the hell are you talking about.

439
00:41:34,913 --> 00:41:38,125
- I just play games, man. Games.
- That's right.

440
00:41:38,125 --> 00:41:40,085
It is a game.
You want to win, don't you?

441
00:41:40,085 --> 00:41:41,336
Yeah, I intent to.

442
00:41:41,336 --> 00:41:44,381
Then you need to cut your
strings puppet master.

443
00:41:44,381 --> 00:41:48,093
Imagine a slave that don't got
to wait to be told what to do.

444
00:41:48,093 --> 00:41:49,970
No ping, you dig?

445
00:41:50,595 --> 00:41:51,888
That would be cheating.

446
00:41:51,888 --> 00:41:54,307
A mod.
That's all it would be.

447
00:41:54,307 --> 00:41:58,437
You know why?
Because the game's got to evolve.

448
00:41:58,478 --> 00:42:01,273
- You feel me?
- I do.

449
00:42:02,149 --> 00:42:04,568
I do feel you my,
giant brother.

450
00:42:04,568 --> 00:42:07,446
Well then,
let's rock baby.

451
00:42:13,118 --> 00:42:17,998
Tillman...
he knows you talked to him.

452
00:42:18,915 --> 00:42:20,917
Your player.

453
00:42:24,921 --> 00:42:27,466
- Who are you?
- A friend.

454
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,385
I don't have any.

455
00:42:30,385 --> 00:42:32,429
Listen to me.

456
00:42:32,429 --> 00:42:37,017
Simon is going to give you what you want.
What you asked him for.

457
00:42:39,394 --> 00:42:42,814
- How do you know that?
- I know something else.

458
00:42:42,856 --> 00:42:45,275
Whether or not he's controlling you,

459
00:42:45,275 --> 00:42:48,195
you will never reach the save point.

460
00:42:48,236 --> 00:42:49,905
Castle won't allow it.

461
00:42:49,905 --> 00:42:52,699
- We'll see.
- No, you have to escape.

462
00:42:52,699 --> 00:42:55,744
Your wife and your
daughter need you, Tillman.

463
00:42:57,287 --> 00:42:59,623
If you want to get out and see
the people in the picture...

464
00:42:59,623 --> 00:43:02,042
you will have to find another way.

465
00:43:06,671 --> 00:43:09,549
I need you to get me something.

466
00:43:09,549 --> 00:43:11,927
What? Tell me.

467
00:43:13,178 --> 00:43:16,348

471
00:44:12,404 --> 00:44:14,031

- You happened!

Kill something!

00:45:41,201 --> 00:45:43,036

479
00:45:43,036 --> 00:45:45,664

This is the last game

00:45:45,664 --> 00:45:48,667

going to look like a total asshole...

Initial reports are that Kable,

505
00:49:47,990 --> 00:49:50,951
the most recognizable face
of the Slayers phenomenon...

506
00:49:50,993 --> 00:49:53,495
next to Ken Castle himself,

507
00:49:53,495 --> 00:49:55,873
is officially listed as fragged.

508
00:49:55,873 --> 00:49:59,251
Just one session away from being
the first Slayer ever...

509
00:49:59,251 --> 00:50:02,129
to win a full pardon and release.

510
00:50:02,129 --> 00:50:06,008
And in NetCast, fledged by technical
difficulties and dead spots

511
00:50:06,008 --> 00:50:08,260
the report could not be confirmed,

512
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:12,222
however Kable, born
John Tillman of Albany, New York

513
00:50:12,222 --> 00:50:14,850
and convicted of murder just 4 years ago,

514
00:50:14,850 --> 00:50:19,021
has been removed from Slayers
rosters and upcoming events listings.

515
00:50:19,021 --> 00:50:21,857

516
00:50:21,857 --> 00:50:23,650
could not be reached for comment.

517
00:50:25,194 --> 00:50:26,695
Do you have a question?

518
00:50:26,695 --> 00:50:28,780
Tillman left her away for the outside, right?

519
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:32,284
- Tillman, yeah.
- Find her.

520
00:51:01,688 --> 00:51:04,358
<i>Blink, activated.</i>

521
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:40,269
She's not home.

522
00:51:40,269 --> 00:51:44,231
But Castle's personal security will be,
soon enough and trust me...

523
00:51:44,231 --> 00:51:47,526
- You don't want to meet them.
- Who are you?

524
00:51:47,526 --> 00:51:49,862
You asked me that once before

525
00:51:50,863 --> 00:51:53,240
- Your voice.
- You know, you should really come with me.

526
00:51:54,324 --> 00:51:55,951
Like now!

527
00:52:51,882 --> 00:52:54,218
See that's why you're a fool!
That's what I'm talking about!

528
00:52:55,803 --> 00:52:59,598
Could you stop

529
00:52:59,598 --> 00:53:02,017
Come one man, that's why
it's a game of deception, man!

530
00:53:08,107 --> 00:53:10,234
That's bullshit, man!
You know that's bullshit!

531
00:53:10,234 --> 00:53:12,236
So you're the ones who broke me out?

532
00:53:12,236 --> 00:53:15,030
- We only freed your mind.
- And your ass follows.

533
00:53:15,030 --> 00:53:16,949
Holly shit...
You made it!

534
00:53:16,949 --> 00:53:23,997
You're really here.
Kable. You're great.

535
00:53:25,916 --> 00:53:29,753
- You got questions.
- A few.

536
00:53:29,753 --> 00:53:31,922
So she took my blood.
Why?

537
00:53:31,922 --> 00:53:33,924
The nanex.

538
00:53:33,924 --> 00:53:36,927
It modifies the actual cell
structure of your brain.

539
00:53:36,927 --> 00:53:40,889
We can crack it, but it's not one size fits all,
we need your DNA

540
00:53:40,889 --> 00:53:43,517
so that we can generate costume code.

541
00:53:43,517 --> 00:53:45,060
Alright, then why me?

542
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:46,812
Because Castle
is afraid of you man.

543
00:53:46,812 --> 00:53:49,982
It ain't just a game, Tillman.
Every day there's more people stepping forward.

544
00:53:49,982 --> 00:53:53,694
Want to be a part of Castle's world,
throwing away everything that means to be human.

545
00:53:53,694 --> 00:53:55,529
Right now is the desperate ones.

546
00:53:55,529 --> 00:53:59,908
Convicts, addicts, the sick, the poor.
The ones that fell through the cracks.

547
00:53:59,908 --> 00:54:01,869
The federal prison system
is growing out of control.

548
00:54:01,869 --> 00:54:03,954
Set to bankrupt the whole damn USA,

549
00:54:03,954 --> 00:54:06,373
then Castle rides in on a white horse

550
00:54:06,373 --> 00:54:09,460
Says he has a plan to bail us all out
and we just fall in line?

551
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:11,086
The healthcare system is collapsing.

552
00:54:11,086 --> 00:54:13,756
And this time he's pushing for
total control over genetic diseases.

553
00:54:13,756 --> 00:54:15,841
Birth defect is no longer an issue.

554
00:54:15,841 --> 00:54:18,218
All we have to do is exchange our cells
for the ones he wants to give us.

555
00:54:18,218 --> 00:54:20,220
Promise of a longer life
and a fatter wallet...

556
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:22,222
- Do you think people will refuse?
- Fuck no.

557
00:54:22,222 --> 00:54:23,849
Then the next thing you know...

558
00:54:25,809 --> 00:54:27,936
we're all slaves.

559
00:54:29,855 --> 00:54:31,482
I can't help you.

560
00:54:32,983 --> 00:54:35,778
Tillman.
We know where she is.

561
00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:42,845
Hi, Nika.

562
00:55:43,637 --> 00:55:46,724
- Oh hi. Rick Rape, right?
- Rick Rape, right?

563
00:55:48,183 --> 00:55:51,145
I thought you weren't allowed
to come here anymore.

564
00:55:56,692 --> 00:55:59,028
That was last month.
I was a bad boy.

565
00:56:01,697 --> 00:56:06,785
Are you still a bad boy?

566
00:57:04,927 --> 00:57:07,888
- Please, don't kill me.
- Please, don't kill me.

567
00:57:07,888 --> 00:57:09,682
No.

568
00:57:10,975 --> 00:57:13,727
- I'll do anything.
- Don't say that.

569
00:57:17,898 --> 00:57:19,275
Stop!

570
00:57:19,275 --> 00:57:22,361
Stop!
Goddamn it.

571
00:57:23,028 --> 00:57:26,782
You, in there controlling...
Let her talk!

572
00:57:26,782 --> 00:57:29,743
I can't she has to say what I tell her.

573
00:57:30,452 --> 00:57:32,496
You can hear me.
I know you can.

574
00:57:35,165 --> 00:57:36,500
I love you.

575
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:38,127
I love you too.

576
00:57:39,003 --> 00:57:40,838
Shut up!

577
00:57:41,922 --> 00:57:44,925
Don't say anything else.
I'm going to find you...

578
00:57:44,925 --> 00:57:48,012
and I'm going to rip you to fucking pieces,
do you understand me?

579
00:57:48,012 --> 00:57:50,055
I'm getting you out of here.

580
00:57:54,059 --> 00:57:56,979
I'm going to take you to some place
where you can turn it off, the program.

581
00:57:58,105 --> 00:58:00,065
Hi Kable.

582
00:58:14,246 --> 00:58:17,082
Look at me bitch!

583
00:58:19,084 --> 00:58:21,045
Anybody in there?

584
00:58:39,188 --> 00:58:41,148
Go on.

585
00:58:41,148 --> 00:58:42,775
Do it.

586
00:59:44,295 --> 00:59:46,589
What the fuck do we do?

587
01:01:50,588 --> 01:01:52,506
I can get you out of here.

588
01:02:02,850 --> 01:02:05,895
Oh shit!
I can't believe it's you!

589
01:02:05,895 --> 01:02:11,567
This is... listen, Tillman,
you can trust me, I swear.

590
01:02:12,693 --> 01:02:16,614
If not...
you're dead!

591
01:02:16,614 --> 01:02:18,324
Okay.
Faster! Faster!

592
01:02:35,883 --> 01:02:37,343
I guess you remember that day, huh?

593
01:02:37,343 --> 01:02:41,347
You just gotten Kable through his
10th consecutive session alive.

594
01:02:42,306 --> 01:02:45,017
No one ever thought an icon could last that long.

595
01:02:45,017 --> 01:02:47,228
Pretty hot shit, aren't you?
King player.

596
01:02:47,228 --> 01:02:49,146
Good times.

597
01:02:49,146 --> 01:02:52,608
Sure, on the outside.
Now look at these.

598
01:02:54,902 --> 01:02:56,821
That's what it's like on the inside.

599
01:02:56,821 --> 01:03:00,116
Wonder how long you would last
on the other side of the screen?

600
01:03:00,783 --> 01:03:03,494
You know, Simon...
you being held here today...

601
01:03:04,745 --> 01:03:07,707
suspected of aiding an escape
of a convicted murder

602
01:03:07,707 --> 01:03:10,042
from a maximum security penitentiary.

603
01:03:10,042 --> 01:03:12,712
The charges are beyond serious.

604
01:03:14,964 --> 01:03:17,174
Your hard drives have been seized.

605
01:03:18,050 --> 01:03:21,387
Forensics are depicting the content
as we speak.

606
01:03:21,387 --> 01:03:24,014
Your internet activity over
the last 10 years,

607
01:03:24,014 --> 01:03:26,684
is being scrutinized and catalogued.

608
01:03:26,684 --> 01:03:28,394
In minute...

609
01:03:29,103 --> 01:03:30,855
vivid detail.

610
01:03:30,855 --> 01:03:33,899
In addition, your father's bank
accounts have been frozen,

611
01:03:33,899 --> 01:03:35,818
pending further investigation.

612
01:03:36,777 --> 01:03:40,698
After all, it was essentially his money
that funded Mr. Tillman's escape.

613
01:03:41,741 --> 01:03:43,325
Now I need you to tell me...

614
01:03:43,325 --> 01:03:46,746
everything that happened leading
up to yesterday afternoon.

615
01:03:46,746 --> 01:03:51,417
Anybody you talked to,
everything you saw, everything you did.

616
01:03:52,501 --> 01:03:55,755
And I need you to tell me that
right now.

617
01:03:55,755 --> 01:03:57,381
Yeah, huh...

618
01:03:58,591 --> 01:04:00,926
I'm going to need something too.

619
01:04:03,304 --> 01:04:07,224
Oh really?
And what might that be?

620
01:04:08,017 --> 01:04:11,354
Could you guys do a sandwich like...

621
01:04:11,354 --> 01:04:14,690
peanut butter,
or almond butter, walnut butter...

622
01:04:14,690 --> 01:04:17,735
huh, pecan butter, pistachio butter..

623
01:04:19,403 --> 01:04:23,282
pretty much any kind of...
you know, nut butter

624
01:04:23,282 --> 01:04:24,909
with some grape jelly.

625
01:04:27,912 --> 01:04:29,872
Pistachio butter.

626
01:04:29,872 --> 01:04:32,958
- They make that?
- It's awesome.

627
01:04:48,057 --> 01:04:49,600
Now what?

628
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:53,396
Now we just put the DNA into the suit,
light it up, extract it...

629
01:04:53,396 --> 01:04:56,107
a few modifying sequences into the code and

630
01:04:56,107 --> 01:04:57,483
we're good to go.

631
01:04:57,483 --> 01:04:59,735
- It's an anti-spyware program.
- Basically.

632
01:04:59,735 --> 01:05:02,279
We can't quarantine the foreign
cells per say, but...

633
01:05:02,279 --> 01:05:05,074
we can disable their ability to transmit and receive.

634
01:05:05,074 --> 01:05:07,618
Fuck that.
I'll make you cut it out me.

635
01:05:07,618 --> 01:05:09,745
That would be like cutting out
a part of your brain.

636
01:05:09,745 --> 01:05:12,581
The nanex cells replace the cells,
they replicate.

637
01:05:12,581 --> 01:05:14,208
They become you.

638
01:05:15,876 --> 01:05:18,587
We're going to have to keep her sedated
until we kill the link.

639
01:05:18,587 --> 01:05:21,590
Otherwise she will be broadcasting
everything she sees and hears,

640
01:05:21,590 --> 01:05:23,509
30 minutes.
You give us a robot...

641
01:05:23,509 --> 01:05:26,971
we give you back a super hot female.

642
01:05:26,971 --> 01:05:28,639
Tillman!

643
01:05:28,639 --> 01:05:30,266
We need to talk.

644
01:05:32,143 --> 01:05:34,312
- So talk.
- Come on.

645
01:05:43,446 --> 01:05:46,157
They tested on soldiers.

646
01:05:46,157 --> 01:05:48,784
The first volunteer was
the corporate Travis Scotch

647
01:05:48,784 --> 01:05:51,203
a friend of yours, I believe.

648
01:05:51,203 --> 01:05:53,497
And the second,
it was you.

649
01:05:58,252 --> 01:06:00,630
The idea was to replace your brain,

650
01:06:01,631 --> 01:06:03,674
bit by bit,
cell by cell.

651
01:06:03,674 --> 01:06:07,261
The new tissue would never break down,
never deteriorate.

652
01:06:08,638 --> 01:06:12,266
A new era in human longevity, that's what they told us.

653
01:06:12,266 --> 01:06:14,393
9 weeks later Scotch was dead.

654
01:06:14,393 --> 01:06:16,562
and you were serving life at maximum.

655
01:06:16,562 --> 01:06:18,272
Castle's project was shut down.

656
01:06:18,272 --> 01:06:20,942
But the same technology
resurfaced within a year

657
01:06:20,942 --> 01:06:22,234
in a game.

658
01:06:22,234 --> 01:06:24,570
Castle called it "Society".

659
01:06:24,570 --> 01:06:28,616
Tillman, listen man, whatever happened in that
project, is something Castle wanted buried.

660
01:06:28,616 --> 01:06:32,036
We need that shit man.
What you saw, what you know.

661
01:06:34,288 --> 01:06:35,831
I don't know what to tell you.

662
01:06:35,831 --> 01:06:37,833
You gotta tell me shit.

663
01:06:37,833 --> 01:06:39,502
I want you to show me.

664
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:45,049
Okay, we're ready to rock.
We're ready to break the link in...

665
01:06:45,049 --> 01:06:47,843
3... 2... 1.

666
01:06:57,895 --> 01:06:59,480
Who's there?

667
01:07:05,278 --> 01:07:07,196
What are you doing here?

668
01:07:08,656 --> 01:07:11,492
- Who are you?
- Tech support.

669
01:07:11,492 --> 01:07:13,119
SOCIETY
LINK FAILURE

670
01:07:23,421 --> 01:07:25,631
- What are we looking at?
- His memories.

671
01:07:25,631 --> 01:07:28,426
Translating into raw audiovisual data.

672
01:07:29,886 --> 01:07:31,596
I read something about this.

673
01:07:31,596 --> 01:07:34,682
But that tech is not supposed to be
available for another decade.

674
01:07:34,682 --> 01:07:37,768
They'll have better shit than
this in Best Buy in 18 months.

675
01:07:46,277 --> 01:07:48,905
Son of a bitch!
John Tillman.

676
01:07:48,905 --> 01:07:52,491
Man I never thought I would be so
happy to see your ugly face.

677
01:07:53,576 --> 01:07:56,871
Scotch.

678
01:07:58,539 --> 01:08:01,876
<i>Is it me or is this place fucked?</i>

679
01:08:02,585 --> 01:08:05,087
<i>They got me hooked up to
computers 5 hours a day.</i>

680
01:08:06,255 --> 01:08:09,217
Feed me vitamins, and pills,
and god knows what

681
01:08:09,217 --> 01:08:11,677
giving me injections, taking and giving me blood...

682
01:08:11,677 --> 01:08:16,057
These nurses are whipping my ass...
and there are male nurses to bro!

683
01:08:17,308 --> 01:08:19,310
I can't believe I let you
talk me in to this.

684
01:08:19,310 --> 01:08:23,731
And I'm having these, like, blackouts...
and is scaring the shit out of me.

685
01:08:23,731 --> 01:08:25,566
I don't even know how long I've been here

686
01:08:28,528 --> 01:08:30,780
Hey man...

687
01:08:32,823 --> 01:08:35,076
<i>Are they letting you out already,
you son of a bitch?</i>

688
01:08:37,370 --> 01:08:39,288
I'm not getting out.

689
01:08:39,288 --> 01:08:40,957
Okay.

690
01:08:45,419 --> 01:08:47,713
Johnny...
Are you good?

691
01:08:49,632 --> 01:08:50,758
I'm fine.

692
01:08:50,758 --> 01:08:52,552
Man you don't look fine.

693
01:08:55,137 --> 01:08:56,472
I'm sorry.

694
01:08:56,472 --> 01:08:58,099
Yeah that's okay.

695
01:08:59,392 --> 01:09:01,811
It's not like you ever been that
good in the first place.

696
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:10,945
What's the gun for, John?

697
01:09:10,945 --> 01:09:12,572
What's happening?

698
01:09:13,823 --> 01:09:16,284
Really you're scaring me man.
What's the gun for?

699
01:09:16,284 --> 01:09:17,743
I can't st...

700
01:09:17,743 --> 01:09:19,620
I can't stop.

701
01:09:19,620 --> 01:09:22,123
Stop what?
What did they do to you man?

702
01:09:24,834 --> 01:09:27,128
John, stop it! You're scaring me now.
Stop it.

703
01:09:27,128 --> 01:09:28,754
Sorry Scotch, I...

704
01:09:30,089 --> 01:09:31,716
John, no! Don't!
Stop!

705
01:09:44,187 --> 01:09:46,564
Not the best commercial for Ken Castle.

706
01:09:46,564 --> 01:09:47,982
They made them do it.

707
01:09:47,982 --> 01:09:49,942
- Castle made them do it.
- It was a test.

708
01:09:49,942 --> 01:09:51,110
Touching.

709
01:09:51,110 --> 01:09:53,029
Excuse me,
media whore.

710
01:09:53,029 --> 01:09:54,906
This isn't just a story.

711
01:09:54,906 --> 01:09:56,991
The whole world is splitting down the middle.

712
01:09:56,991 --> 01:09:59,410
Sooner or later,
everyone is going to have to take a side,

713
01:09:59,410 --> 01:10:01,037
even scavengers like you!

714
01:10:41,119 --> 01:10:42,870
It's you.

715
01:10:50,461 --> 01:10:52,672
I missed you, so much!

716
01:10:52,672 --> 01:10:54,966
You are the reason I held on.

717
01:11:00,138 --> 01:11:02,682
- I love you.
- Where's our daughter?

718
01:11:08,771 --> 01:11:10,565
I couldn't stop them. I'm sorry.

719
01:11:10,565 --> 01:11:12,817
Nobody could.

720
01:11:12,817 --> 01:11:16,446
The foster parents paid good money
to remain anonymous.

721
01:11:16,446 --> 01:11:19,073
But there's always a data trail
if you know where to look.

722
01:11:19,073 --> 01:11:20,450
Where is she?

723
01:11:20,450 --> 01:11:21,993
I'm sorry, Tillman.

724
01:11:21,993 --> 01:11:23,953
She's with Castle.

725
01:11:40,303 --> 01:11:41,929
Tillman!

726
01:11:43,806 --> 01:11:46,184
That's all the story
you're going to get.

727
01:11:59,447 --> 01:12:01,074
Silverton, get up.

728
01:12:03,367 --> 01:12:05,578
What's going on man?

729
01:12:05,578 --> 01:12:08,915
Looks like someone up the chain
has decided you're no longer a threat.

730
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:19,801
CHEATER

731
01:12:19,801 --> 01:12:22,303
FUCK YOU CHEATER!

732
01:12:28,351 --> 01:12:32,897
NANEX
ACCESS DENIED

733
01:12:37,652 --> 01:12:39,404
We'll find him.

734
01:12:40,530 --> 01:12:42,156
Don't worry.

735
01:12:42,824 --> 01:12:44,534
We'll come to us.

736
01:12:46,285 --> 01:12:49,455
KABLE, THE FALLEN HERO OF SLAYER
REST IN PEACE

737
01:14:00,026 --> 01:14:02,779
- Not bad for a video, huh?
- What?

738
01:14:02,779 --> 01:14:06,366
The latest and greatest, I defy you
to tell it from real life...

739
01:14:06,366 --> 01:14:08,201
could you imagine porn on this thing?

740
01:14:49,492 --> 01:14:55,623
<i>I've got you under my skin</i>

741
01:14:55,623 --> 01:15:01,879
<i>I've got you deep
in the heart of me.</i>

742
01:15:02,422 --> 01:15:04,841
<i>So deep in my heart</i>

743
01:15:04,882 --> 01:15:08,886
<i>that you're really a part of me</i>

744
01:15:09,929 --> 01:15:15,310
<i>I've got you under my skin</i>

745
01:15:15,310 --> 01:15:20,231
<i>I'd tried so not to give in</i>

746
01:15:22,358 --> 01:15:27,697
<i>I said to myself:
this affair never will go so well</i>

747
01:15:29,198 --> 01:15:34,787
<i>But why should I try to resist
when, baby, I know so well</i>

748
01:15:34,787 --> 01:15:41,044
<i>I've got you...</i>

749
01:15:42,337 --> 01:15:44,297
<i>under my skin.</i>

750
01:15:46,132 --> 01:15:49,260
<i>I'd sacrifice anything come what might</i>

751
01:15:49,260 --> 01:15:52,680
<i>For the sake of havin' you near.</i>

752
01:15:52,680 --> 01:15:56,601
<i>In spite of a warnin'
voice that comes in the night</i>

753
01:15:56,601 --> 01:15:59,896
<i>And repeats, repeats in my ear...</i>

754
01:15:59,896 --> 01:16:05,985
<i>Don't you know, little
fool, you never can win?</i>

755
01:16:05,985 --> 01:16:12,241
<i>Use your mentality,
wake up to reality.</i>

756
01:16:12,784 --> 01:16:18,164
<i>But each time that I do
just the thought of you</i>

757
01:16:18,164 --> 01:16:20,625
<i>Makes me stop before I begin</i>

758
01:16:20,625 --> 01:16:24,462
<i>'Cause I've got you under my skin</i>

759
01:16:27,799 --> 01:16:32,220
<i>under my skin.</i>

760
01:16:36,432 --> 01:16:37,725
You're awesome!

761
01:16:37,725 --> 01:16:39,102
Castle.

762
01:16:39,102 --> 01:16:40,728
Kable.

763
01:16:42,021 --> 01:16:43,523
I don't care about you.

764
01:16:43,523 --> 01:16:45,900
You just want your little
sugar pie, I know.

765
01:16:45,900 --> 01:16:47,568
So don't do anything stupid.

766
01:16:48,361 --> 01:16:49,946
My house, my rules.

767
01:16:50,780 --> 01:16:52,657
Come on, I want to show you something

768
01:16:59,205 --> 01:17:01,791
I wanted to thank you for
leading me into them,

769
01:17:01,791 --> 01:17:04,335
the Humanzuz's cell, that is.

770
01:17:05,753 --> 01:17:08,673
Of course sooner or later they
would be whistling my tune

771
01:17:08,673 --> 01:17:10,466
just like everybody else, but...

772
01:17:10,466 --> 01:17:13,845
Meantime, there's that little cracker
program they dreamed of that got my attention.

773
01:17:13,845 --> 01:17:15,972
That was a genuine disuse, no doubt about it

774
01:17:15,972 --> 01:17:18,266
One thing even they didn't know, though,

775
01:17:18,266 --> 01:17:20,393
I'm wired too.

776
01:17:20,393 --> 01:17:25,523
I replaced 98% of my own noodle
with nano-tissue years ago.

777
01:17:25,523 --> 01:17:29,068
But mine's different.
It's built to send,

778
01:17:31,446 --> 01:17:32,530
to transmit,

779
01:17:32,530 --> 01:17:34,991
whereas every other nano-cell
that I've put out there,

780
01:17:34,991 --> 01:17:37,952
including the ones
in your head Kable,

781
01:17:37,952 --> 01:17:40,246
are designed to receive.

782
01:17:40,246 --> 01:17:42,916
I think it, you do it.

783
01:17:50,715 --> 01:17:53,635
We're talking every Slayer,
everyone in Society city.

784
01:17:53,635 --> 01:17:56,179
I believe your better half would
fall under that category,

785
01:17:56,179 --> 01:17:58,848
provided they were within
range of my transmitters.

786
01:17:58,848 --> 01:18:02,352
Very nice, Castle. So you got
an army of psychotics

787
01:18:02,352 --> 01:18:04,771
and deviants to dance around for you?

788
01:18:04,771 --> 01:18:10,235
You're thinking small, Kable.
But not as small as me.

789
01:18:10,235 --> 01:18:12,529
See, nano-cells are real small.

790
01:18:12,529 --> 01:18:16,115
A thousand times smaller than
these dust particulars.

791
01:18:17,075 --> 01:18:19,619
You inhale it. They go to work;
replicating, spreading

792
01:18:19,619 --> 01:18:22,664
like a virus, multiplying
in exponentials.

793
01:18:22,664 --> 01:18:26,125
Six months time, I can have a
hundred million people converted.

794
01:18:26,125 --> 01:18:28,795
Ditch diggers, porn stars,
and presidents.

795
01:18:28,795 --> 01:18:30,213
Not one would be the wiser.

796
01:18:30,213 --> 01:18:33,258
A hundred million people who buy
what I want them to buy,

797
01:18:33,258 --> 01:18:35,426
vote how I want them to vote,

798
01:18:35,426 --> 01:18:39,180
do pretty much damn well anything
I figure they ought to do.

799
01:18:39,931 --> 01:18:41,516
For instance...

800
01:19:17,886 --> 01:19:20,305
You should have let him
fight for himself.

801
01:19:21,514 --> 01:19:23,224
Maybe you would've had a shot.

802
01:19:23,224 --> 01:19:26,436
- I think you're missing the point, my man.
- No no, I get it.

803
01:19:26,436 --> 01:19:27,937
You're pulling all the strings around here.

804
01:19:27,937 --> 01:19:30,607
Which makes my next move pretty...

805
01:19:32,775 --> 01:19:34,569
Neglected to mention my smart boys reversed

806
01:19:34,569 --> 01:19:36,905
that crack the Humanz worked for you.

807
01:19:36,905 --> 01:19:39,782
Easy breezy once I had access to their drives.

808
01:19:49,667 --> 01:19:53,379
<i>You're mine boy.</i>

809
01:20:10,897 --> 01:20:12,816
Come one, let's boogey wooguey
rock n' roll.

810
01:20:20,281 --> 01:20:23,284
I think that badass Slayer of the game
don't seem like much, does he?

811
01:20:31,334 --> 01:20:32,961
Lucky shot

812
01:20:35,338 --> 01:20:36,965
Not really.

813
01:20:49,102 --> 01:20:51,563
I need an audience
boys...

814
01:21:09,080 --> 01:21:14,878
No no no, you crawl...
on your belly like a toad.

815
01:21:14,878 --> 01:21:17,172
Is this bad?
I'm really bad.

816
01:21:17,797 --> 01:21:19,841
<i>Is this bad?
I'm really bad.</i>

817
01:21:26,848 --> 01:21:28,475
That's sweet.

818
01:21:31,269 --> 01:21:34,939
Alright boys are you ready?
It's time for a true test.

819
01:21:35,940 --> 01:21:38,818
Just like last time, remember?

820
01:21:41,613 --> 01:21:44,616
Yeah, you're stronger now,
a little more fighting...

821
01:21:44,616 --> 01:21:47,619
But I think the end result
will be just about the same.

822
01:22:07,222 --> 01:22:08,681
What the hell was that?

823
01:22:08,681 --> 01:22:11,226
Someone from the outside
is sending him commands...

824
01:22:11,226 --> 01:22:13,311
We're being broadcast live.

825
01:22:14,270 --> 01:22:16,898
Jam the signal!

826
01:22:17,941 --> 01:22:19,442
Goddamn retards!

827
01:22:19,442 --> 01:22:21,069
We're working on it...

828
01:22:22,779 --> 01:22:24,406
I think it,

829
01:22:24,948 --> 01:22:27,450
You... fucking... do it...

830
01:22:36,376 --> 01:22:38,461
Look at this knife...

831
01:22:38,461 --> 01:22:40,547
imagine me sticking it into your gut.

832
01:22:42,132 --> 01:22:45,635
Think about it...
make it real!

833
01:23:17,709 --> 01:23:19,335
Yes!

834
01:23:40,398 --> 01:23:44,402
- Are you okay?
- Are you my daddy, Tillman?

835
01:23:47,030 --> 01:23:48,656
I'm your daddy.

836
01:23:53,745 --> 01:23:55,372
Wait.

837
01:23:56,915 --> 01:23:59,042
- Shut it off.
- Pardon?

838
01:23:59,042 --> 01:24:01,127
The nanex.

839
01:24:02,128 --> 01:24:05,840
It's nothing to you.
Just a mouse click.

840
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:07,425
Set us free.

841
01:24:13,473 --> 01:24:15,183
Well played, Kable.
