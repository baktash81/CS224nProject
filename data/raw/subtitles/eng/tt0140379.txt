1
00:03:08,449 --> 00:03:11,009
We'll eat with these.

2
00:03:11,085 --> 00:03:12,052
Crystal!

3
00:04:29,196 --> 00:04:30,629
Ah.

4
00:04:31,699 --> 00:04:33,462
Now, fair Hippolyta,

5
00:04:33,534 --> 00:04:35,729
our nuptial hour draws on a pace.

6
00:04:35,803 --> 00:04:39,739
Four happy days
bring in another moon.

7
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:44,437
But O, me thinks, how slow
this old moon wanes!

8
00:04:44,511 --> 00:04:47,947
She lingers my desires,

9
00:04:48,015 --> 00:04:50,142
like to a step dame or a dowager,

10
00:04:50,217 --> 00:04:51,980
long withering out
a young man's revenue.

11
00:04:52,052 --> 00:04:54,646
Four days will quickly
steep themselves in night,

12
00:04:54,722 --> 00:04:58,249
four nights will quickly
dream away the time.

13
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:04,959
And then the moon,
like to a silver bow

14
00:05:05,032 --> 00:05:06,590
new-bent in heaven,

15
00:05:06,667 --> 00:05:09,864
shall behold the night
of our solemnities.

16
00:05:09,937 --> 00:05:13,168
Happy be Theseus,
our renowned duke.

17
00:05:14,241 --> 00:05:16,641
Thanks, good Egeus.

18
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:19,474
What's the news with thee?

19
00:05:20,848 --> 00:05:23,442
Full of vexation come I,

20
00:05:23,517 --> 00:05:26,179
with complaint against my child,

21
00:05:26,253 --> 00:05:28,414
my daughter Hermia.

22
00:05:32,192 --> 00:05:34,092
Egeus:
Stand forth, Demetrius.

23
00:05:35,529 --> 00:05:36,587
My noble lord,

24
00:05:36,663 --> 00:05:39,461
this man hath
my consent to marry her.

25
00:05:39,533 --> 00:05:42,627
Stand forth, Lysander.

26
00:05:42,703 --> 00:05:45,763
This man hath bewitched
the bosom of my child.

27
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:47,773
Thou, thou, Lysander,

28
00:05:47,841 --> 00:05:49,570
thou hast given her rhymes

29
00:05:49,643 --> 00:05:51,133
and interchanged love tokens

30
00:05:51,211 --> 00:05:53,179
with my child.

31
00:05:53,247 --> 00:05:54,874
With cunning hast thou filched

32
00:05:54,948 --> 00:05:56,210
my daughter's heart.

33
00:05:56,283 --> 00:05:58,046
Turned her obedience,
which is due to me,

34
00:05:58,118 --> 00:06:00,086
to stubborn harshness.

35
00:06:03,824 --> 00:06:05,485
And, my gracious duke,

36
00:06:05,559 --> 00:06:07,857
be it so she will not
here before your grace

37
00:06:07,928 --> 00:06:09,793
consent to marry
with Demetrius.

38
00:06:09,863 --> 00:06:13,230
I beg the ancient
privilege of Athens.

39
00:06:15,302 --> 00:06:18,328
As she is mine,
I may dispose of her,

40
00:06:18,405 --> 00:06:24,139
and that shall be either
to this gentleman...

41
00:06:24,211 --> 00:06:25,735
or to her death,

42
00:06:25,813 --> 00:06:29,909
according to our law...

43
00:06:29,983 --> 00:06:32,508
immediately provided
in that case.

44
00:06:37,491 --> 00:06:38,890
What say you, Hermia?

45
00:06:40,027 --> 00:06:43,053
Relent, sweet Hermia,
and, Lysander, yield

46
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:45,030
thy crazed title
to my certain right.

47
00:06:45,099 --> 00:06:46,589
You have her father's love,
Demetrius.

48
00:06:46,667 --> 00:06:48,760
Let me have Hermia's.

49
00:06:48,836 --> 00:06:50,861
Do you marry him.

50
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:53,504
Cur. Cur!

51
00:06:53,574 --> 00:06:56,008
Scornful Lysander,

52
00:06:56,076 --> 00:06:58,203
true, he hath my love,

53
00:06:58,278 --> 00:07:01,338
and what is mine
my love shall render him.

54
00:07:01,415 --> 00:07:03,110
And she is mine,

55
00:07:03,183 --> 00:07:05,674
and all my right of her

56
00:07:05,752 --> 00:07:08,653
I do estate unto Demetrius.

57
00:07:08,722 --> 00:07:11,555
I am, my lord,
as well derived as he,

58
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:14,389
as well possessed.
My love is more than his,

59
00:07:14,461 --> 00:07:17,328
and which is more than
all these boasts can be,

60
00:07:17,397 --> 00:07:19,388
I am beloved
of beauteous Hermia.

61
00:07:19,466 --> 00:07:22,867
Why should not I
then prosecute my right?

62
00:07:22,936 --> 00:07:26,963
Demetrius,
I'll avouch it to his head,

63
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,871
made love to
Nedar's daughter Helena

64
00:07:28,942 --> 00:07:31,570
and won her soul.

65
00:07:31,645 --> 00:07:36,207
And she, sweet lady, dotes,

66
00:07:36,283 --> 00:07:38,843
devoutly dotes,
dotes in idolatry,

67
00:07:38,919 --> 00:07:41,717
upon this spotted
and inconstant man.

68
00:07:41,788 --> 00:07:44,848
I must confess
I have heard so much.

69
00:07:47,261 --> 00:07:51,254
I do entreat your grace
to pardon me.

70
00:07:51,331 --> 00:07:53,322
I know not by what power
I am made bold,

71
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,494
nor how it may concern
my modesty

72
00:07:56,570 --> 00:08:00,267
in such a presence here
to plead my thoughts...

73
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:02,535
but I beseech your grace
that I may know

74
00:08:02,609 --> 00:08:04,474
the worst that may
be fall me in this case.

75
00:08:04,545 --> 00:08:05,512
Either to die the death,

76
00:08:05,579 --> 00:08:08,139
or to abjure forever
the society of men.

77
00:08:08,215 --> 00:08:12,242
And therefore, fair Hermia,
question your desires,

78
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,187
know of your youth,
examine well your blood,

79
00:08:16,256 --> 00:08:18,918
whether, if you yield not
to your father's choice,

80
00:08:18,992 --> 00:08:21,153
you can endure
the livery of a nun,

81
00:08:21,228 --> 00:08:24,664
for aye to be
in shady cloister mewed,

82
00:08:24,731 --> 00:08:26,722
to live a barren sister
all your life,

83
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,598
chanting faint hymns
to the cold fruitless moon.

84
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:33,197
So will I grow...

85
00:08:33,273 --> 00:08:35,901
so live, so die, mylord,

86
00:08:35,976 --> 00:08:38,137
ere I will yield
my virgin patent up

87
00:08:38,212 --> 00:08:40,180
unto his lordship
whose unwished yoke

88
00:08:40,247 --> 00:08:42,272
my soul consents
not to give sovereignty.

89
00:08:45,152 --> 00:08:47,712
Take time to pause.

90
00:08:57,898 --> 00:08:59,456
By the next new moon,

91
00:08:59,533 --> 00:09:01,660
upon that day
either prepare to die

92
00:09:01,735 --> 00:09:03,703
for disobedience
to your father's will,

93
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:07,900
or else to wed Demetrius,
as he would,

94
00:09:07,975 --> 00:09:09,909
or on Diana's altar to protest

95
00:09:09,977 --> 00:09:14,243
for aye austerity
and single life.

96
00:09:18,285 --> 00:09:20,776
For you, fair Hermia,
look you arm yourself

97
00:09:20,854 --> 00:09:23,755
to fit your fancies
to your father's will.

98
00:09:28,462 --> 00:09:29,622
Come, Hippolyta.

99
00:09:35,969 --> 00:09:37,960
Demetrius, come.

100
00:09:38,038 --> 00:09:39,562
And come, Egeus.

101
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,609
I have some private schooling
for you both.

102
00:09:52,319 --> 00:09:54,412
How now, my love?

103
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,924
Why is your cheek so pale?

104
00:10:02,996 --> 00:10:06,124
How chance the roses there
do fade so fast?

105
00:10:06,199 --> 00:10:08,599
Be like for want of rain,

106
00:10:08,669 --> 00:10:10,000
which I could well beteem them

107
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:12,868
from the tempest of my eyes.

108
00:10:12,939 --> 00:10:14,270
Aye me!

109
00:10:18,178 --> 00:10:20,203
For aught
that I could ever read,

110
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,248
could ever hear
by tale or history,

111
00:10:22,316 --> 00:10:26,616
the course of true love
never did run smooth.

112
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:30,623
If there were
a sympathy in choice,

113
00:10:30,691 --> 00:10:33,626
war, death, or sickness
did lay siege to it,

114
00:10:33,694 --> 00:10:38,222
making it momentary as a sound,

115
00:10:38,298 --> 00:10:41,734
swift as a shadow,
short as any dream,

116
00:10:41,802 --> 00:10:44,828
as brief as the lightning
in the collied night,

117
00:10:44,905 --> 00:10:47,533
that, in a spleen,
unfolds both heaven and earth,

118
00:10:47,607 --> 00:10:51,134
and ere a man hath power
to say'behold!'

119
00:10:51,211 --> 00:10:55,648
the jaws of darkness
to devour it up.

120
00:10:55,716 --> 00:10:59,812
So quick bright things
come to confusiÃ³n.

121
00:11:04,157 --> 00:11:07,593
Therefore hear me, Hermia.

122
00:11:07,661 --> 00:11:09,094
I have a widow aunt,

123
00:11:09,162 --> 00:11:11,255
a do wager of great revenue,

124
00:11:11,331 --> 00:11:13,299
and she respects me
as her only son.

125
00:11:13,367 --> 00:11:15,665
Helena: Demetrius!

126
00:11:16,737 --> 00:11:18,204
Demetrius!

127
00:11:20,173 --> 00:11:22,403
Demetrius!

128
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:25,102
Ohh.

129
00:11:28,115 --> 00:11:30,640
Demetrius!

130
00:11:38,191 --> 00:11:41,058
How happy some
o'er other some can be!

131
00:11:41,128 --> 00:11:43,892
Through Athens I am thought
as fair as she.

132
00:11:43,964 --> 00:11:45,522
But what of that?

133
00:11:45,599 --> 00:11:47,863
Demetrius thinks not so.

134
00:11:47,934 --> 00:11:51,370
He will not know what all
but he do know.

135
00:11:51,438 --> 00:11:55,306
Love looks not with the eyes,
but with the mind,

136
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:59,209
and therefore is winged Cupid
painted blind.

137
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:00,644
God speed, fair Helena.

138
00:12:00,714 --> 00:12:02,773
Whit her away?

139
00:12:05,118 --> 00:12:07,382
Call you me fair?

140
00:12:07,454 --> 00:12:09,445
That fair again unsay.

141
00:12:09,523 --> 00:12:11,582
Demetrius loves your fair.

142
00:12:13,393 --> 00:12:17,989
O...happy fair!

143
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,468
Sickness is catching.

144
00:12:22,536 --> 00:12:24,401
O, were favor so,

145
00:12:24,471 --> 00:12:28,464
yours would I catch,
fair Hermia, ere I go.

146
00:12:28,542 --> 00:12:31,943
O,teach me how you look,
and with what art

147
00:12:32,012 --> 00:12:34,503
you sway the motion
of Demetrius' heart.

148
00:12:34,581 --> 00:12:37,106
His folly, Helena,
is no fault of mine.

149
00:12:37,184 --> 00:12:39,812
None but your beauty.

150
00:12:39,886 --> 00:12:42,116
Would that fault were mine!

151
00:12:42,189 --> 00:12:45,283
Take comfort.

152
00:12:45,358 --> 00:12:47,622
He no more shall see my face.

153
00:12:47,694 --> 00:12:50,527
Lysanderand myself
shall fly this place.

154
00:12:50,597 --> 00:12:52,121
Helen...

155
00:12:52,199 --> 00:12:54,224
to you our minds we will unfold.

156
00:12:54,301 --> 00:12:57,668
Tomorrow night,
when Phoebe doth behold

157
00:12:57,737 --> 00:12:59,932
her silver visage
in the watery glass,

158
00:13:00,006 --> 00:13:02,566
a time that lovers' flights
doth still conceal,

159
00:13:02,642 --> 00:13:05,975
through Athens gates
have we devised to steal.

160
00:13:06,046 --> 00:13:08,742
And thence from Athens
turn away our eyes

161
00:13:08,815 --> 00:13:11,045
to seek new friends
and stranger companies.

162
00:13:11,117 --> 00:13:12,084
Egeus: Hermia!

163
00:13:12,152 --> 00:13:13,744
Ohh.

164
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,583
Hermia!

165
00:13:17,157 --> 00:13:19,421
Farewell, sweetplay fellow.

166
00:13:19,493 --> 00:13:21,461
Pray thou for us,

167
00:13:21,528 --> 00:13:24,088
and good luck grant thee
thy Demetrius.

168
00:13:24,164 --> 00:13:25,096
Egeus: Hermia!

169
00:13:25,165 --> 00:13:26,928
Ohh.

170
00:13:28,168 --> 00:13:29,100
Keep word, Lysander.

171
00:13:29,169 --> 00:13:31,160
I will, my Hermia.

172
00:13:41,181 --> 00:13:42,273
Helena, adieu.

173
00:13:42,349 --> 00:13:46,410
As you on him,
Demetrius dote on you.

174
00:13:49,189 --> 00:13:52,181
Oh... spite!

175
00:13:52,259 --> 00:13:54,615
Oh, hell.

176
00:14:36,724 --> 00:14:38,658
Ah, buon giorno!

177
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:54,664
Is all our company here?

178
00:15:54,735 --> 00:15:56,532
Here, PeterQuince.

179
00:15:56,603 --> 00:15:59,071
Best to call them
generally, man by man,

180
00:15:59,139 --> 00:16:00,663
according to the scrip.

181
00:16:05,646 --> 00:16:07,511
Come here, here.

182
00:16:07,581 --> 00:16:09,776
Here is the scroll
of every man's name

183
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:11,545
which is thought fit
through all our town

184
00:16:11,618 --> 00:16:12,676
to playin our interlude

185
00:16:12,753 --> 00:16:13,685
before the duke and duchess

186
00:16:13,754 --> 00:16:15,016
on his wedding day a tnight.

187
00:16:15,089 --> 00:16:17,023
But first,
good PeterQuince,

188
00:16:17,091 --> 00:16:19,025
say what the play treats on,

189
00:16:19,093 --> 00:16:21,527
then read the names
of the actors,

190
00:16:21,595 --> 00:16:22,892
and so grow to a point.

191
00:16:22,963 --> 00:16:25,557
Marry, our play is
The Most Lamentable Comedy

192
00:16:25,632 --> 00:16:28,192
and Cruel Death
of Pyramus and Thisby.

193
00:16:28,268 --> 00:16:31,760
A very good piece of work,
I assure you, and a merry.

194
00:16:32,973 --> 00:16:34,907
Now, good PeterQuince,
call forth your actors

195
00:16:34,975 --> 00:16:36,966
by the scroll.

196
00:16:37,044 --> 00:16:39,035
Masters...

197
00:16:39,113 --> 00:16:41,047
spread yourselves.

198
00:16:41,115 --> 00:16:44,050
So, uh, answer as I call you.

199
00:16:44,118 --> 00:16:45,642
Nick Bottom the weaver.

200
00:16:45,719 --> 00:16:47,380
Ready.

201
00:16:47,454 --> 00:16:49,388
Name what part I am for,
and proceed.

202
00:16:49,456 --> 00:16:52,425
You, Nick Bottom,
are set down for Pyramus.

203
00:16:53,927 --> 00:16:55,326
What is Pyramus?

204
00:16:55,396 --> 00:16:56,863
A lover or a tyrant?

205
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:58,898
He's a lover
that kills himself,

206
00:16:58,966 --> 00:17:00,661
most gallant, for love.

207
00:17:00,734 --> 00:17:02,133
All:Ahh.

208
00:17:02,202 --> 00:17:04,500
That will ask some tears
in the true performing of it.

209
00:17:04,571 --> 00:17:07,506
If I do it, let the audience
look to their eyes.

210
00:17:07,574 --> 00:17:10,008
I will move storms.

211
00:17:10,077 --> 00:17:13,911
I will condole in some measure.

212
00:17:13,981 --> 00:17:15,846
Now,to the rest.

213
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:16,848
Quince:Well-

214
00:17:16,917 --> 00:17:18,214
Yet, my chief humor
is for a tyrant.

215
00:17:18,285 --> 00:17:20,412
I could play Ercles rarely,

216
00:17:20,487 --> 00:17:22,512
or a part to tear a catin,

217
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:24,022
to make all split.

218
00:17:24,091 --> 00:17:25,023
Francis Flute-

219
00:17:25,092 --> 00:17:26,992
The raging rocks

220
00:17:27,061 --> 00:17:29,996
and shivering shocks
shall break the locks

221
00:17:30,064 --> 00:17:31,759
of prison gates,

222
00:17:31,832 --> 00:17:34,198
and Phibbus' car

223
00:17:34,268 --> 00:17:41,800
shall shine from far

224
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:47,711
and... make and mar

225
00:17:47,781 --> 00:17:50,682
the foolish fates.

226
00:17:50,751 --> 00:17:52,116
Ha ha ha.

227
00:17:55,889 --> 00:17:58,289
This was lofty. Ha ha.

228
00:17:58,358 --> 00:18:00,292
Uh, ahem, Pyramus.

229
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:03,227
Uh, Francis Flute
the bellows-mender.

230
00:18:03,297 --> 00:18:04,662
Here, PeterQuince.

231
00:18:04,731 --> 00:18:05,891
Francis Flute,

232
00:18:05,966 --> 00:18:07,558
you must take Thisby on you.

233
00:18:07,634 --> 00:18:09,226
What is Thisby?
A wandering knight?

234
00:18:09,303 --> 00:18:11,328
He's the lady
that Pyramus must love.

235
00:18:16,076 --> 00:18:18,306
Nay, faith,
let not me play a woman.

236
00:18:18,378 --> 00:18:19,470
I have a beard coming.

237
00:18:19,546 --> 00:18:21,980
And I may hide my face,
let me play Thisby,too.

238
00:18:22,049 --> 00:18:23,016
Ohh-

239
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:25,381
I'll speak in
a monstrous little voice:

240
00:18:25,452 --> 00:18:26,942
''Thisne, Thisne!''

241
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:29,580
Ah, Pyramus, my lover dear,

242
00:18:29,656 --> 00:18:32,147
thy Thisby dear, and lady dear!''

243
00:18:32,226 --> 00:18:33,158
Ohh!

244
00:18:33,227 --> 00:18:36,025
No, no,
you must play Pyramus.

245
00:18:36,096 --> 00:18:37,028
Snout...

246
00:18:37,097 --> 00:18:38,689
and Flute, you Thisby.

247
00:18:40,534 --> 00:18:42,126
Robin Starveling the tailor.

248
00:18:42,202 --> 00:18:44,136
Here, PeterQuince.

249
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:48,137
Ah,well...

250
00:18:51,778 --> 00:18:55,771
Snug the joiner,
you the lion's part.

251
00:18:55,849 --> 00:18:56,781
Ahh.

252
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:58,283
And I hope we have
a play well fitted.

253
00:18:58,352 --> 00:19:00,980
Have you
the lion's part written?

254
00:19:01,054 --> 00:19:03,454
Pray you, if it be,
give it me,

255
00:19:03,524 --> 00:19:04,821
for I am slow of study.

256
00:19:04,892 --> 00:19:06,587
No, you may do it extempore,

257
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:07,854
for it is nothing but roaring.

258
00:19:07,928 --> 00:19:09,088
Roar!

259
00:19:09,163 --> 00:19:10,892
Roar!

260
00:19:10,964 --> 00:19:13,364
Let me play the lion, too.

261
00:19:13,433 --> 00:19:15,230
I will roar that I will do

262
00:19:15,302 --> 00:19:16,667
any man's heart good to hear me.

263
00:19:16,737 --> 00:19:18,932
I will roar that
I will make the duke say,

264
00:19:19,006 --> 00:19:21,998
''Let him roar again.
Let him roar again!''

265
00:19:22,075 --> 00:19:23,337
But you should do it
too terribly,

266
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:24,342
that you would fright

267
00:19:24,411 --> 00:19:25,343
the duchess and the ladies,

268
00:19:25,412 --> 00:19:26,674
and they would shriek.

269
00:19:26,747 --> 00:19:29,477
And that were enough
to hang us all.

270
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:31,040
I grant you, friends,

271
00:19:31,118 --> 00:19:33,052
if I should fright the ladies
out of their wits,

272
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,486
they would have no more
discretion but to hang us.

273
00:19:35,556 --> 00:19:38,855
But I will aggravate my voice
so that I will roar you

274
00:19:38,926 --> 00:19:41,258
as gently as any sucking dove;

275
00:19:41,328 --> 00:19:45,765
I will roar you
an 'twere any nightingale.

276
00:19:56,643 --> 00:19:59,703
Aah-

277
00:20:49,162 --> 00:20:52,598
You can play no part
but Pyramus.

278
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:55,601
Pyramus is a sweet-faced man,

279
00:20:55,669 --> 00:20:58,194
a proper man as one shall see
in a summer's day,

280
00:20:58,272 --> 00:21:02,072
a most lovely gentlemanlike man.

281
00:21:02,142 --> 00:21:05,600
Therefore you must
needs play Pyramus.

282
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:19,752
Well...

283
00:21:21,628 --> 00:21:23,789
I will undertake it.

284
00:21:23,864 --> 00:21:26,298
Masters,
you have all your parts,

285
00:21:26,366 --> 00:21:28,425
and I am to entreat you
to con them by tomorrow night

286
00:21:28,502 --> 00:21:30,470
and to meet in the palace wood,
a mile without the town.

287
00:21:30,537 --> 00:21:32,061
There will we rehearse.

288
00:21:32,139 --> 00:21:35,336
If we meet in the city,
we will be dogged by company

289
00:21:35,409 --> 00:21:37,377
and our devices known.

290
00:21:37,444 --> 00:21:40,208
Pray you fail me not.

291
00:21:41,281 --> 00:21:43,579
We will meet

292
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:45,550
and there we may rehearse

293
00:21:45,619 --> 00:21:48,918
most obscenely
and courageously.

294
00:21:48,989 --> 00:21:50,923
Take pains.

295
00:21:50,991 --> 00:21:52,720
Be perfect.

296
00:21:54,461 --> 00:21:56,122
Adieu.

297
00:23:37,464 --> 00:23:39,989
Ere Demetrius looked
on Hermia's eyne,

298
00:23:40,066 --> 00:23:43,467
he hailed down oaths
that he was only mine.

299
00:23:43,537 --> 00:23:47,029
And when this hail
some heat from Hermia felt,

300
00:23:47,107 --> 00:23:48,938
so he dissolved,

301
00:23:49,009 --> 00:23:51,204
and showers of oaths did melt.

302
00:23:54,815 --> 00:23:58,376
I will go tell him
of fair Hermia's flight.

303
00:23:58,452 --> 00:23:59,783
Then to the wood this very night

304
00:23:59,853 --> 00:24:01,377
will he pursue her.

305
00:25:06,448 --> 00:25:07,380
Get off!.

306
00:25:07,449 --> 00:25:08,848
Get off there!

307
00:25:08,917 --> 00:25:10,908
Ah, fie!

308
00:25:36,345 --> 00:25:38,745
Oh, sweet beauty!

309
00:25:39,848 --> 00:25:41,509
How now, spirit?

310
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:44,017
Whit her wander you?

311
00:25:44,086 --> 00:25:46,054
Over hill, over dale,

312
00:25:46,121 --> 00:25:48,214
through bush,
through a briar,

313
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:49,951
over park, over pale,

314
00:25:50,025 --> 00:25:51,754
through flood, through a fire,

315
00:25:51,827 --> 00:25:54,261
I do wander everywhere.

316
00:25:54,329 --> 00:25:56,524
Swifter than the moon's sphere.

317
00:25:56,598 --> 00:25:59,362
And I serve the fairy queen,

318
00:25:59,434 --> 00:26:01,732
to dew her orbs upon the green.

319
00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:07,406
Either I mistake your shape
and making quite,

320
00:26:07,476 --> 00:26:10,070
or else you are that shrewd
and knavish sprite

321
00:26:10,145 --> 00:26:11,407
called Robin Goodfellow.

322
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,004
Are not you he

323
00:26:13,081 --> 00:26:15,015
that frights the maidens
of the villagery-

324
00:26:15,083 --> 00:26:16,141
Psst!

325
00:26:16,218 --> 00:26:19,346
Skims milk, and sometimes
labors in the quern

326
00:26:19,421 --> 00:26:21,753
and bootless makes
the breathless housewife churn?

327
00:26:21,823 --> 00:26:24,553
Are not you he?

328
00:26:24,626 --> 00:26:26,059
Thou speak'sta right.

329
00:26:26,128 --> 00:26:28,255
I am that merry wanderer
of the night.

330
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:30,662
I jest to Oberon

331
00:26:30,732 --> 00:26:32,290
and make him smile

332
00:26:32,367 --> 00:26:35,063
when I a fatand
bean-fed horse beguile,

333
00:26:35,137 --> 00:26:37,162
neighing in likeness
of a filly foal.

334
00:26:42,711 --> 00:26:44,975
And sometimes...

335
00:26:46,982 --> 00:26:48,279
Ugh!

336
00:26:53,422 --> 00:26:56,983
Farewell,thou lob of spirits.

337
00:26:57,059 --> 00:26:59,550
I'll be gone.

338
00:26:59,628 --> 00:27:03,928
The queen and all herelves
come here anon.

339
00:27:03,999 --> 00:27:06,763
The king doth keep
his revels here tonight.

340
00:27:06,835 --> 00:27:09,360
Take heed the queen come
not within his sight.

341
00:27:15,143 --> 00:27:17,202
For Oberon

342
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:20,077
is passing fell

343
00:27:20,148 --> 00:27:21,638
and wrath.

344
00:27:43,572 --> 00:27:45,164
- Hey!
- Go on.

345
00:28:11,733 --> 00:28:15,430
Ill met by moonlight,
proud Titania.

346
00:28:15,504 --> 00:28:17,665
What,jealous Oberon!

347
00:28:17,739 --> 00:28:19,070
Fairies, skip hence.

348
00:28:19,141 --> 00:28:21,837
I have forsworn
his bed and company.

349
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:22,877
Tarry!

350
00:28:22,944 --> 00:28:25,105
Rashwanton,

351
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,943
am not I thy lord?

352
00:28:28,984 --> 00:28:31,111
Then I must be thy lady.

353
00:28:37,692 --> 00:28:39,819
Why art thou here,

354
00:28:39,895 --> 00:28:42,921
come from
the farthest steppe of India,

355
00:28:42,998 --> 00:28:47,458
but that, for sooth,
the bouncing Amazon,

356
00:28:47,536 --> 00:28:51,370
your buskin'd mistress
and your warrior love,

357
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,772
to Theseus must be wedded,

358
00:28:53,842 --> 00:28:55,605
and you come to give their bed

359
00:28:55,677 --> 00:28:57,304
joy and prosperity.

360
00:28:57,379 --> 00:29:00,280
How canst thou thus
for shame, Titania,

361
00:29:00,348 --> 00:29:02,282
glance at my credit
with Hippolyta,

362
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:04,318
knowing I know
thy love to Theseus?

363
00:29:04,386 --> 00:29:06,718
These are the forgeries
of jealousy.

364
00:29:06,788 --> 00:29:10,519
And never, since
the middle summer's spring,

365
00:29:10,592 --> 00:29:13,755
met we on hill,
in dale, forest, or mead,

366
00:29:13,829 --> 00:29:16,093
by paved fountain
or by rushy brook,

367
00:29:16,164 --> 00:29:18,064
but with thy brawls

368
00:29:18,133 --> 00:29:20,567
thou hast disturbed our sport.

369
00:29:20,635 --> 00:29:24,071
Therefore, the winds,
piping to us in vain,

370
00:29:24,139 --> 00:29:25,367
as in revenge,

371
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,001
have sucked up from the sea
contagious fogs,

372
00:29:29,077 --> 00:29:31,272
which, falling in the land,

373
00:29:31,346 --> 00:29:34,509
hath every pelting river
made so proud

374
00:29:34,583 --> 00:29:38,019
that they have overborne
their continents.

375
00:29:38,086 --> 00:29:40,520
And this same progeny
of evils comes

376
00:29:40,589 --> 00:29:42,454
from our debate,

377
00:29:42,524 --> 00:29:44,424
from our dissensiÃ³n.

378
00:29:44,493 --> 00:29:47,985
We are their parents
and original.

379
00:29:48,063 --> 00:29:49,553
Do you amend it then?

380
00:29:52,067 --> 00:29:54,092
It lies in you.

381
00:29:54,169 --> 00:29:57,297
Why should Titania
cross her Oberon?

382
00:29:57,372 --> 00:29:59,101
I do but beg
a little changeling boy

383
00:29:59,174 --> 00:30:00,607
to be my henchman.

384
00:30:00,675 --> 00:30:02,700
Set your heart at rest.

385
00:30:02,777 --> 00:30:07,305
The fairyland buys
not the child of me.

386
00:30:07,382 --> 00:30:10,977
His mother was
a votaress of my order,

387
00:30:11,052 --> 00:30:13,486
and in the spiced Indian air,

388
00:30:13,555 --> 00:30:18,424
by night, full often
hath she gossiped by my side

389
00:30:18,493 --> 00:30:21,985
and sat with me
on Neptune's yellow sands,

390
00:30:22,063 --> 00:30:26,261
marking the embarked traders
on the flood

391
00:30:26,334 --> 00:30:30,327
when we have laughed
to see the sails conceive

392
00:30:30,405 --> 00:30:33,863
and growbig-bellied
with the wanton wind.

393
00:30:36,211 --> 00:30:40,238
But she, being mortal,
of that boy did die,

394
00:30:40,315 --> 00:30:44,308
and for her sake
do I rear up her boy.

395
00:30:44,386 --> 00:30:47,048
And for her sake

396
00:30:47,122 --> 00:30:49,090
I will not part with him.

397
00:30:49,157 --> 00:30:52,149
How long within this wood
intend you stay?

398
00:30:52,227 --> 00:30:55,128
Perchance till after
Theseus'wedding day.

399
00:30:57,465 --> 00:31:02,334
If you will patiently
dance in our round...

400
00:31:02,404 --> 00:31:05,373
and see our moonlight revels,

401
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,668
go with us.

402
00:31:06,741 --> 00:31:09,039
Give me that boy,
and I will go with thee.

403
00:31:12,914 --> 00:31:15,906
Not for thy fairy kingdom!

404
00:31:15,984 --> 00:31:17,781
Fairies, away!

405
00:31:17,852 --> 00:31:21,447
We shall chide downright
if I longer stay.

406
00:31:25,627 --> 00:31:26,889
Well, go thy way.

407
00:31:26,962 --> 00:31:29,362
Thou shalt not from this grove

408
00:31:29,431 --> 00:31:31,865
till I torment thee
for this injury.

409
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,902
My gentle Puck, come hit her.

410
00:31:42,277 --> 00:31:44,074
Thou rememberest,

411
00:31:44,145 --> 00:31:46,613
since once I sat
upon a promontory

412
00:31:46,681 --> 00:31:49,206
and heard a mermaid
on a dolphin's back

413
00:31:49,284 --> 00:31:52,845
uttering such dulcet
and harmonious breath

414
00:31:52,921 --> 00:31:56,288
that the rude sea
grew civil a ther song.

415
00:31:59,294 --> 00:32:02,320
That verytime, I saw,
but thou couldst not,

416
00:32:02,397 --> 00:32:05,798
flying between the cold
moon and the Earth,

417
00:32:05,867 --> 00:32:08,700
Cupid all armed.

418
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:11,102
A certain aim he took

419
00:32:11,172 --> 00:32:13,572
and loosed his love shaft smartly

420
00:32:13,642 --> 00:32:15,269
from his bow.

421
00:32:15,343 --> 00:32:19,040
Yet, marked I where
the bolt of Cupid fell.

422
00:32:19,114 --> 00:32:22,049
It fell upon
a little western flower,

423
00:32:22,117 --> 00:32:23,584
before milk-white,

424
00:32:23,652 --> 00:32:25,677
now purple with love'swound.

425
00:32:27,322 --> 00:32:29,415
Fetch me that flower.

426
00:32:29,491 --> 00:32:31,584
The juice of it,
on sleeping eyelids laid,

427
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:34,493
will make all man, all woman
madly dote

428
00:32:34,562 --> 00:32:37,554
upon the next live creature
that it sees.

429
00:32:39,801 --> 00:32:41,200
Fetch me this herb

430
00:32:41,269 --> 00:32:42,702
and be thou here again

431
00:32:42,771 --> 00:32:44,932
ere the leviathan
can swim a league.

432
00:32:45,006 --> 00:32:46,701
I'll puta girdle
round about the Earth

433
00:32:46,775 --> 00:32:48,208
in 40 minutes.

434
00:33:02,857 --> 00:33:04,950
Having once this juice,

435
00:33:05,026 --> 00:33:08,427
I'll watch Titania
when she's asleep

436
00:33:08,496 --> 00:33:12,023
and drop the liquor of it
in hereyes.

437
00:33:15,003 --> 00:33:18,234
The next thing then
she waking looks upon...

438
00:33:18,306 --> 00:33:23,039
she shall pursue it
with the soul oflove.

439
00:33:23,111 --> 00:33:27,571
And ere I take this charm
from off her sight,

440
00:33:27,649 --> 00:33:29,116
I'll make her render up
herpage to me.

441
00:33:29,151 --> 00:33:30,584
I'll make her render up
herpage to me.

442
00:33:30,652 --> 00:33:33,849
I love thee not,
therefore pursue me not!

443
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:45,358
Where is Lysanderand fair Hermia?

444
00:33:45,433 --> 00:33:47,731
Thou toldst me they were
stolen unto this wood,

445
00:33:47,802 --> 00:33:50,134
and here am I,
and wode within this wood,

446
00:33:50,205 --> 00:33:51,729
because I cannot meet my Hermia!

447
00:33:55,810 --> 00:33:56,834
Hence!

448
00:33:56,911 --> 00:33:59,880
Get thee gone
and follow me no more!

449
00:34:10,058 --> 00:34:12,151
Do I entice you?

450
00:34:12,227 --> 00:34:14,218
Do I speak you fair?

451
00:34:14,295 --> 00:34:17,264
Or rather, do I not
in plainest truth tell you

452
00:34:17,332 --> 00:34:20,301
I do not,
nor I cannot, love you?

453
00:34:20,368 --> 00:34:23,166
And even for that
do I love you the more.

454
00:34:24,672 --> 00:34:27,038
I am your spaniel.

455
00:34:27,108 --> 00:34:29,235
And, Demetrius,
the more you beat me,

456
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:30,902
I will fawn on you.

457
00:34:30,979 --> 00:34:33,539
Use me but as your spaniel.

458
00:34:33,615 --> 00:34:35,640
Spurn me, strike me,

459
00:34:35,717 --> 00:34:38,083
neglect me, lose me,
but give me leave,

460
00:34:38,153 --> 00:34:40,451
unworthy as I am,
to follow you.

461
00:34:40,522 --> 00:34:42,752
What worser place
can I beg in your love

462
00:34:42,824 --> 00:34:45,952
than to be used
as you use your dog?

463
00:34:46,027 --> 00:34:48,757
Tempt not too much
the hatred of my spirit,

464
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:51,230
for I am sick
when I do look on thee.

465
00:34:51,299 --> 00:34:54,666
And I am sick
when I look not on you!

466
00:34:54,736 --> 00:34:56,226
Do...

467
00:34:56,304 --> 00:34:58,238
impeach your modesty

468
00:34:58,306 --> 00:34:59,637
too much

469
00:34:59,707 --> 00:35:01,368
to leave the city

470
00:35:01,442 --> 00:35:02,807
and commit yourself
into the hands of one

471
00:35:02,877 --> 00:35:05,072
that loves you not?

472
00:35:05,146 --> 00:35:09,276
To trust the opportunity
of night...

473
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:12,877
and the ill counsel
of a desert place

474
00:35:12,954 --> 00:35:16,287
with the richworth
of your virginity?

475
00:35:18,059 --> 00:35:19,458
Your virtue

476
00:35:19,527 --> 00:35:21,518
is my privilege.

477
00:35:23,064 --> 00:35:24,691
For that

478
00:35:24,766 --> 00:35:27,860
it is not night
when I do see your face.

479
00:35:27,936 --> 00:35:30,166
Therefore I think
I am not in the night.

480
00:35:30,238 --> 00:35:32,399
Nor doth this wood
lack worids of company,

481
00:35:32,473 --> 00:35:35,806
for you in my respect
are all the worid.

482
00:35:35,877 --> 00:35:37,572
I'll run from thee

483
00:35:37,645 --> 00:35:38,839
and hide me in the brakes

484
00:35:38,913 --> 00:35:41,814
and leave thee to
the mercy of wild beasts!

485
00:35:41,883 --> 00:35:44,249
The wildest hath not
such a heart as you.

486
00:35:44,319 --> 00:35:45,616
Run when you will,

487
00:35:45,687 --> 00:35:47,314
the story shall be changed.

488
00:35:47,388 --> 00:35:49,720
Apollo flies,
and Daphne holds the chase.

489
00:35:49,791 --> 00:35:51,850
The dove pursues the griffin.

490
00:35:51,926 --> 00:35:53,757
I will not stay thy questions!

491
00:35:53,828 --> 00:35:55,193
Let me go!

492
00:35:55,263 --> 00:35:57,356
Or if thou follow me,
do not believe

493
00:35:57,432 --> 00:35:58,729
but I shall do thee
mischief in the wood!

494
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,166
Aye, in the temple,
in the town, in the field,

495
00:36:01,236 --> 00:36:03,864
you do me mischief-oh!

496
00:36:03,938 --> 00:36:07,305
Fie, Demetrius!

497
00:36:07,375 --> 00:36:11,812
Your wrongs do set
a scandal on my sex!

498
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:12,938
Oh!

499
00:36:13,014 --> 00:36:17,007
We cannot fight for love
as men may do.

500
00:36:20,688 --> 00:36:23,122
We should be wooed

501
00:36:23,191 --> 00:36:25,682
and were not made to woo.

502
00:36:31,866 --> 00:36:34,198
I'll follow thee

503
00:36:34,269 --> 00:36:36,430
and make a heaven of hell

504
00:36:36,504 --> 00:36:40,406
to die upon the hand
I love so well.

505
00:36:46,314 --> 00:36:47,872
Fare thee well, nymph.

506
00:36:49,217 --> 00:36:50,514
Ere he shall leave this grove,

507
00:36:50,585 --> 00:36:52,519
thou shalt fly him,

508
00:36:52,587 --> 00:36:54,282
and he shall seek thy love.

509
00:36:58,293 --> 00:36:59,988
Hast thou the flower there?

510
00:37:01,996 --> 00:37:03,759
Ahh...

511
00:37:15,743 --> 00:37:19,270
I know a bank where
the wild thy me blows,

512
00:37:19,347 --> 00:37:23,613
where oxlips and
the nodding violet grows,

513
00:37:23,685 --> 00:37:28,816
quite over canopied
with the luscious woodbine,

514
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:32,053
with sweetmusk-roses
and with eglantine.

515
00:37:33,394 --> 00:37:37,262
There sleeps Titania
sometime of the night.

516
00:37:37,332 --> 00:37:41,564
Lulled in these flowers
with dances and delight.

517
00:37:41,636 --> 00:37:46,164
And there the snake
throws her enameled skin,

518
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:50,108
weed wide enough
to wrap a fairy in.

519
00:37:50,178 --> 00:37:53,170
With the juice of this
I'll streak her eyes

520
00:37:53,247 --> 00:37:56,580
and make her full
of hateful fantasies.

521
00:38:00,722 --> 00:38:02,690
Take thou some of it

522
00:38:02,757 --> 00:38:04,657
and seek through this grove.

523
00:38:04,726 --> 00:38:07,286
A sweet Athenian lady
is in love

524
00:38:07,362 --> 00:38:09,592
with a disdainful youth.

525
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:11,063
Anoin this eyes,

526
00:38:11,132 --> 00:38:13,999
but do it when
the next thing he espies

527
00:38:14,068 --> 00:38:16,263
maybe the lady.

528
00:38:16,337 --> 00:38:17,804
Thou shalt know the man

529
00:38:17,872 --> 00:38:19,737
by the Athenian garments
he hath on.

530
00:38:19,807 --> 00:38:21,798
And look...

531
00:38:21,876 --> 00:38:24,743
thou meet me ere
the firstcock crow.

532
00:38:24,812 --> 00:38:26,245
Fear not, my lord.

533
00:38:26,314 --> 00:38:28,214
Your servant shall do so.

534
00:39:04,102 --> 00:39:06,036
Hello, my queen.

535
00:39:06,104 --> 00:39:08,265
How sweet! Hello.

536
00:39:36,735 --> 00:39:39,568
Sing me now asleep.

537
00:39:39,637 --> 00:39:43,164
Then to thy offices
and let me rest.

538
00:40:17,375 --> 00:40:18,865
Hence, away.

539
00:40:18,943 --> 00:40:20,911
Now all is well.

540
00:40:20,979 --> 00:40:23,106
One a loof stands sentinel.

541
00:40:59,984 --> 00:41:03,078
What thou seest
when thou dost awake,

542
00:41:03,154 --> 00:41:07,113
do it for thy true love take.

543
00:41:07,192 --> 00:41:09,092
Love...

544
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:11,492
and languish for his sake.

545
00:41:14,098 --> 00:41:16,931
Be it ounce orcator bear,

546
00:41:17,001 --> 00:41:19,834
pard, or boar
with bristled hair...

547
00:41:21,372 --> 00:41:22,805
In thy eye that doth appear

548
00:41:22,874 --> 00:41:24,739
when thou wakest,

549
00:41:24,809 --> 00:41:26,902
it is thy dear.

550
00:41:33,551 --> 00:41:35,712
Wake when some vile thing
is near.

551
00:41:46,931 --> 00:41:49,195
Fairlove.

552
00:41:49,267 --> 00:41:51,235
You faint when wandering
in the wood,

553
00:41:51,302 --> 00:41:53,702
and to speak troth,

554
00:41:53,771 --> 00:41:55,238
I forgot our way.

555
00:41:55,306 --> 00:41:57,638
Oh.

556
00:41:57,709 --> 00:42:00,109
We'll rest us, Hermia,
if you think it good

557
00:42:00,178 --> 00:42:02,476
and tarry for the comfort
of the day.

558
00:42:02,547 --> 00:42:04,606
Be it so, Lysander.

559
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:13,582
Well, find you out a bed...

560
00:42:13,658 --> 00:42:15,751
for I upon this bank
shall rest my head.

561
00:42:48,493 --> 00:42:50,290
Lysander!

562
00:42:50,361 --> 00:42:52,556
One turfshall serve
as pillow for us both.

563
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:54,097
One heart, one bed.

564
00:42:54,165 --> 00:42:55,928
Two bosoms and one troth.

565
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,934
Nay, good Lysander.
For my sake, my dear,

566
00:42:58,002 --> 00:43:00,197
lie further off yet.
Do not lie so near.

567
00:43:00,271 --> 00:43:03,035
Oh,take the sense,
sweet, of my innocence.

568
00:43:04,776 --> 00:43:06,209
I mean...

569
00:43:06,277 --> 00:43:08,040
that my heart unto yours is knit

570
00:43:08,112 --> 00:43:09,477
so that but one heart

571
00:43:09,547 --> 00:43:11,174
we can make of it.

572
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:13,376
Two bosoms

573
00:43:13,451 --> 00:43:14,884
interchained with an oath

574
00:43:14,953 --> 00:43:18,514
so then two bosoms
in a single troth.

575
00:43:18,590 --> 00:43:20,820
Then by your side,

576
00:43:20,892 --> 00:43:23,793
no bedroom me deny.

577
00:43:23,861 --> 00:43:25,260
For lying so, Hermia,

578
00:43:25,330 --> 00:43:26,763
I do not lie.

579
00:43:30,935 --> 00:43:33,267
Lysander riddles very prettily.

580
00:43:43,348 --> 00:43:45,077
Mmm.

581
00:43:45,149 --> 00:43:46,309
Nay, gentle friend.

582
00:43:49,053 --> 00:43:50,077
Mmm!

583
00:43:50,154 --> 00:43:52,588
For love and courtesy,
lie further off.

584
00:43:54,792 --> 00:43:56,453
In human modesty...

585
00:43:59,130 --> 00:44:01,462
such separation
as may well be said

586
00:44:01,532 --> 00:44:03,796
becomes a virtuous bachelor
and a maid.

587
00:44:06,137 --> 00:44:08,605
So far be distant.

588
00:44:08,673 --> 00:44:11,733
And good night, sweet friend.

589
00:44:11,809 --> 00:44:13,242
Thy love ne'er alter

590
00:44:13,311 --> 00:44:14,744
till thy sweet life end.

591
00:44:14,812 --> 00:44:15,801
Amen.

592
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:18,542
Amen to that fair prayer,
say I.

593
00:44:18,616 --> 00:44:20,174
And then end life

594
00:44:20,251 --> 00:44:22,344
when I end loyalty.

595
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:32,088
Here is my bed.

596
00:44:32,163 --> 00:44:34,131
Sleep give thee all his rest.

597
00:44:34,198 --> 00:44:36,666
With half that wish,
the wisher's eyes be pressed.

598
00:44:56,721 --> 00:44:58,416
Through the forest have I gone,

599
00:44:58,489 --> 00:45:02,118
but Athenian found I none
on whose eyes I might approve

600
00:45:02,193 --> 00:45:05,128
this flower's force
in stirring love.

601
00:45:09,634 --> 00:45:11,898
Night...

602
00:45:11,969 --> 00:45:13,664
and silence.

603
00:45:17,709 --> 00:45:19,973
But who is here?

604
00:45:23,181 --> 00:45:25,741
Weeds of Athens
he doth wear-oh!

605
00:45:25,817 --> 00:45:28,684
This is he, my master said,
despised the Athenian maid.

606
00:46:26,477 --> 00:46:29,241
And there the maiden,
sleeping sound

607
00:46:29,313 --> 00:46:32,544
on the dank and dirty ground.

608
00:46:39,490 --> 00:46:41,185
Pretty soul.

609
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:45,422
She durst not lie
with this lack-love,

610
00:46:45,496 --> 00:46:47,487
this kill-courtesy.

611
00:46:50,334 --> 00:46:53,929
Churl,
upon thy eyes I throw

612
00:46:54,005 --> 00:46:56,997
all the power
this charm doth owe.

613
00:46:57,074 --> 00:46:59,474
When thou wakest,
let love forbid

614
00:46:59,544 --> 00:47:02,980
sleep his seaton thy eyelid.

615
00:47:03,047 --> 00:47:05,811
And so awake when I am gone,

616
00:47:05,883 --> 00:47:08,010
for I must now...

617
00:47:08,085 --> 00:47:09,746
to Oberon!

618
00:47:12,089 --> 00:47:13,681
I charge thee hence,

619
00:47:13,758 --> 00:47:14,952
and do not haunt me thus.

620
00:47:15,026 --> 00:47:16,459
Oh,wilt thou darkling leave me?

621
00:47:16,527 --> 00:47:17,687
Do not so.

622
00:47:17,762 --> 00:47:19,525
Stay on thy peril.

623
00:47:19,597 --> 00:47:21,258
I alone will go.

624
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:33,171
I am out of breath
in this fond chase.

625
00:47:34,345 --> 00:47:37,974
The more my prayer,
the lesser is my grace.

626
00:47:40,351 --> 00:47:43,081
Happy is Hermia,
where soe'er she lies,

627
00:47:43,154 --> 00:47:46,590
for she hath blessed
and attractive eyes.

628
00:47:49,694 --> 00:47:53,528
How came her eyes so bright?

629
00:47:53,598 --> 00:47:56,089
Not with salt tears.

630
00:47:56,167 --> 00:47:59,796
If so, my eyes are oftener
washed than hers.

631
00:48:01,539 --> 00:48:03,632
No.

632
00:48:03,708 --> 00:48:05,266
No, no.

633
00:48:05,343 --> 00:48:06,435
No.

634
00:48:06,510 --> 00:48:10,344
I am as...ugly...

635
00:48:10,414 --> 00:48:12,974
as a bear.

636
00:48:13,050 --> 00:48:16,850
For beasts that meet me
run away for fear.

637
00:48:25,796 --> 00:48:27,559
Lysander?

638
00:48:35,172 --> 00:48:37,538
Dead or asleep?

639
00:48:37,608 --> 00:48:41,044
Lysander, if you live,
good sir, awake.

640
00:48:41,112 --> 00:48:42,773
Oh.

641
00:48:42,847 --> 00:48:45,975
And run through fire
I will for thy sweet sake.

642
00:48:46,050 --> 00:48:47,415
Where is Demetrius?

643
00:48:47,485 --> 00:48:49,510
Oh, how fit a word
is that vile name

644
00:48:49,587 --> 00:48:51,179
to perish on my sword.

645
00:48:51,255 --> 00:48:54,691
Do not say so, Lysander.
Say not so.

646
00:48:54,759 --> 00:48:56,886
What?
Though he love your Hermia?

647
00:48:56,961 --> 00:48:59,657
Lord, what though?

648
00:48:59,730 --> 00:49:01,493
Yet Hermia still loves you,

649
00:49:01,565 --> 00:49:02,862
then be content.

650
00:49:02,934 --> 00:49:04,595
Content with Hermia?

651
00:49:04,669 --> 00:49:07,536
No. I do repent
the tedious minutes

652
00:49:07,605 --> 00:49:08,799
I with her have spent.

653
00:49:08,873 --> 00:49:12,070
Not Hermia, but Helena I love.

654
00:49:12,143 --> 00:49:15,044
Who will not change
a raven for a dove?

655
00:49:16,714 --> 00:49:18,045
Wherefore was I

656
00:49:18,115 --> 00:49:20,447
to this keen mockery born?

657
00:49:20,518 --> 00:49:21,450
When at your hands

658
00:49:21,519 --> 00:49:23,282
did I deserve such scorn?

659
00:49:23,354 --> 00:49:24,616
Is't not enough,

660
00:49:24,689 --> 00:49:26,213
is't not enough, young man,

661
00:49:26,290 --> 00:49:28,758
that I did never,
no, nor never can,

662
00:49:28,826 --> 00:49:30,794
deserve a sweetlook
from Demetrius' eye

663
00:49:30,861 --> 00:49:33,796
but you must flout
my insufficiency?

664
00:49:33,864 --> 00:49:37,129
Oh, but fare you well.

665
00:49:37,201 --> 00:49:39,066
Per force I must confess,

666
00:49:39,136 --> 00:49:43,664
I thought you lord
of more true gentleness.

667
00:49:43,741 --> 00:49:45,606
She sees not Hermia.

668
00:49:46,844 --> 00:49:48,812
Hermia, sleeps thou there,

669
00:49:48,879 --> 00:49:51,905
and never mayst thou come
Lysander near.

670
00:49:51,983 --> 00:49:55,009
And, all my powers,

671
00:49:55,086 --> 00:49:58,522
address your love and might

672
00:49:58,589 --> 00:50:00,682
to honor Helen

673
00:50:00,758 --> 00:50:03,989
and to be her knight!

674
00:50:10,216 --> 00:50:12,548
Aye, me.

675
00:50:12,618 --> 00:50:14,677
For pity,
what a dream was here.

676
00:50:14,754 --> 00:50:16,619
Ohh.

677
00:50:17,690 --> 00:50:20,158
Lysander, look how I do quake...

678
00:50:20,226 --> 00:50:22,319
with fear.

679
00:50:22,395 --> 00:50:24,260
Lysander?

680
00:50:27,366 --> 00:50:29,266
Lysander?

681
00:50:31,304 --> 00:50:33,067
Lysander!

682
00:50:44,083 --> 00:50:46,051
Here's a marvelous,
convenient place

683
00:50:46,118 --> 00:50:47,449
for our rehearsal.

684
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:50,648
This green plot
shall be our stage,

685
00:50:50,723 --> 00:50:53,783
this hawthorn brake
our tiring house,

686
00:50:53,859 --> 00:50:55,724
and we will, uh,

687
00:50:55,795 --> 00:50:56,921
do it in action

688
00:50:56,996 --> 00:50:59,328
as we will do it
before the duke.

689
00:50:59,398 --> 00:51:00,456
PeterQuince.

690
00:51:00,533 --> 00:51:02,228
What sayest thou,
bully Bottom?

691
00:51:02,301 --> 00:51:06,738
There are things in this
Comedy of Pyramus and...

692
00:51:06,806 --> 00:51:07,738
Thisby.

693
00:51:07,807 --> 00:51:09,638
Thisby that will never please.

694
00:51:09,709 --> 00:51:11,802
First, Pyramus must draw a sword

695
00:51:11,877 --> 00:51:13,538
to kill himself

696
00:51:13,613 --> 00:51:15,046
which the ladies cannot abide.

697
00:51:15,114 --> 00:51:16,706
By our lady, a parlous fear.

698
00:51:16,782 --> 00:51:19,080
I believe we must
leave the killing out

699
00:51:19,151 --> 00:51:20,175
when all is done.

700
00:51:20,253 --> 00:51:21,481
Not a whit.

701
00:51:21,554 --> 00:51:24,785
I have a device to make all well.

702
00:51:24,857 --> 00:51:26,381
Write me a prologue,

703
00:51:26,459 --> 00:51:28,188
and let the prologue seem to say

704
00:51:28,261 --> 00:51:30,422
we will do no harm
with our swords

705
00:51:30,496 --> 00:51:32,862
and that Pyramus is not
killed indeed,

706
00:51:32,932 --> 00:51:33,990
and for the more better assurance

707
00:51:34,066 --> 00:51:35,090
tell them that I, Pyramus,

708
00:51:35,167 --> 00:51:36,361
am not Pyramus,

709
00:51:36,435 --> 00:51:37,834
but Bottom the weaver.

710
00:51:37,903 --> 00:51:39,837
This will put them out of fear.

711
00:51:39,905 --> 00:51:42,203
Oh,well, we will have
such a prologue,

712
00:51:42,275 --> 00:51:44,800
and it shall be written
in, uh, 8 and 6.

713
00:51:44,877 --> 00:51:45,809
No, make it 2 more.

714
00:51:45,878 --> 00:51:47,175
Let it be written
in 8 and 8.

715
00:51:47,246 --> 00:51:50,477
But there is 2 hard things:

716
00:51:50,549 --> 00:51:53,177
That is to bring
the moonlight into a chamber,

717
00:51:53,252 --> 00:51:55,652
for, you know, Pyramus
and Thisby meet by moonlight.

718
00:51:55,721 --> 00:51:57,086
Doth the moon shine

719
00:51:57,156 --> 00:51:58,145
that night we play our play?

720
00:51:58,224 --> 00:51:59,691
A calendar. A calendar!

721
00:51:59,759 --> 00:52:00,691
Calendar.

722
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:01,692
Look in the almanac.

723
00:52:01,761 --> 00:52:03,194
Find out if the moon shine.

724
00:52:03,262 --> 00:52:04,194
Find out moon shine.

725
00:52:04,263 --> 00:52:06,424
It doth shine that night.

726
00:52:06,499 --> 00:52:08,399
It doth shine that night.

727
00:52:11,637 --> 00:52:13,468
Why, then may you leave

728
00:52:13,539 --> 00:52:15,029
a casement
of the great chamber window

729
00:52:15,107 --> 00:52:17,166
open where we play,

730
00:52:17,243 --> 00:52:18,676
and the moon may shine in

731
00:52:18,744 --> 00:52:20,837
at the casement.

732
00:52:20,913 --> 00:52:22,676
Two hard things.

733
00:52:22,748 --> 00:52:25,273
We must have a wall
in the greatchamber,

734
00:52:25,351 --> 00:52:27,410
for Pyramus and Thisby,
says the story,

735
00:52:27,486 --> 00:52:30,455
did talk through
the chink of a wall.

736
00:52:30,523 --> 00:52:33,219
You can never bring in a wall.

737
00:52:33,292 --> 00:52:35,123
What say you, Bottom?

738
00:52:36,862 --> 00:52:39,330
Some man

739
00:52:39,398 --> 00:52:42,765
or other must present wall.

740
00:52:42,835 --> 00:52:44,166
Uh, Sam. Sam.

741
00:52:44,236 --> 00:52:47,694
And let him have some plaster

742
00:52:47,773 --> 00:52:49,934
or some loam or some
rough cast about him

743
00:52:50,009 --> 00:52:52,910
to signify wall.

744
00:52:55,481 --> 00:52:58,109
And let him hold his fingers thus,

745
00:52:58,184 --> 00:53:01,051
and through that cranny

746
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:02,883
shall Pyramus and...

747
00:53:02,955 --> 00:53:03,887
Starveling:Thisby.

748
00:53:03,956 --> 00:53:05,321
Thisby whisper.

749
00:53:05,391 --> 00:53:06,585
You can never bring in a wall.

750
00:53:06,659 --> 00:53:08,320
No, no, no.
A- And if this maybe,

751
00:53:08,394 --> 00:53:09,861
then all is well.

752
00:53:09,929 --> 00:53:10,896
Pyramus, you begin,

753
00:53:10,963 --> 00:53:12,362
and when you have
spoken your speech,

754
00:53:12,431 --> 00:53:16,333
enter into that brake.
Thisby, stand forth.

755
00:53:16,402 --> 00:53:19,269
Now, left foot forward
and then antique gesture.

756
00:53:19,338 --> 00:53:21,670
Uh, Pyramus, speak.

757
00:53:21,741 --> 00:53:24,733
What hempen home spuns
have we swaggering here

758
00:53:24,810 --> 00:53:27,176
so near the cradle
of the fairy queen?

759
00:53:27,246 --> 00:53:28,304
Line.

760
00:53:28,381 --> 00:53:29,313
Quince:Thisby.

761
00:53:29,382 --> 00:53:30,349
Thisby,

762
00:53:30,416 --> 00:53:33,874
the flowers of odious
savors sweet-

763
00:53:33,953 --> 00:53:35,682
Odorous. Odorous.

764
00:53:35,755 --> 00:53:38,087
Odorous savors sweet,

765
00:53:38,157 --> 00:53:41,422
so hath thy breath,
my dearest Thisby dear.

766
00:53:41,494 --> 00:53:42,722
But hark!

767
00:53:42,795 --> 00:53:44,558
A voice.

768
00:53:44,630 --> 00:53:45,688
Stay thou but here a while,

769
00:53:45,765 --> 00:53:48,962
and by and by
I will to thee appear.

770
00:53:50,102 --> 00:53:52,696
A stranger Pyramus
than e'er played here.

771
00:53:52,772 --> 00:53:55,240
Psst.
Must I speak now?

772
00:53:55,307 --> 00:53:56,831
Aye, marry, must you,
for he goes back

773
00:53:56,909 --> 00:53:57,933
to see a noise that he heard

774
00:53:58,010 --> 00:53:59,238
and is to come again.

775
00:54:00,913 --> 00:54:02,005
Most radiant-

776
00:54:02,081 --> 00:54:04,345
Quince:
Most radiant...

777
00:54:04,417 --> 00:54:05,645
Most radiant-

778
00:54:05,718 --> 00:54:06,650
Most radiant...

779
00:54:06,719 --> 00:54:08,152
Most radiant Pyramus...

780
00:54:09,221 --> 00:54:10,153
Most-

781
00:54:10,222 --> 00:54:11,484
Shh. Shh.

782
00:54:11,557 --> 00:54:14,219
Lily-white of hue...

783
00:54:14,293 --> 00:54:16,659
If I were fair, Thisby.

784
00:54:16,729 --> 00:54:19,129
If I were only thine.

785
00:55:00,806 --> 00:55:03,707
I'll meet thee, Pyramus,

786
00:55:03,776 --> 00:55:05,243
at Ninny's tomb.

787
00:55:05,311 --> 00:55:07,040
That's Ninus'tomb, man!

788
00:55:07,112 --> 00:55:10,081
Why, you must not speak that yet.

789
00:55:10,149 --> 00:55:12,083
That you answer to Pyramus.

790
00:55:12,151 --> 00:55:13,743
You speak all your part at once,

791
00:55:13,819 --> 00:55:15,252
cues and all.

792
00:55:15,321 --> 00:55:17,569
Enter, Pyramus!

793
00:55:20,238 --> 00:55:22,729
The cue is past.
It is ''never tire.''

794
00:55:22,808 --> 00:55:24,708
If I were fair,Thisby.

795
00:55:24,776 --> 00:55:26,437
If I were fair,Thisby.

796
00:55:26,511 --> 00:55:29,071
If I were fair,Thisby,

797
00:55:29,147 --> 00:55:30,341
I were only thine.

798
00:55:30,415 --> 00:55:31,746
Aah! Aah!

799
00:55:31,817 --> 00:55:33,182
Aah! Aah!

800
00:55:33,251 --> 00:55:34,980
Oh, monstrous.
Oh, strange.

801
00:55:35,053 --> 00:55:35,917
Fly, masters.

802
00:55:35,987 --> 00:55:37,045
We are haunted.

803
00:55:37,122 --> 00:55:39,249
Oh. Ooh.

804
00:55:39,324 --> 00:55:41,792
Bottom,thou art changed.

805
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:43,020
What do I see on thee?

806
00:55:43,094 --> 00:55:44,789
What do you see?

807
00:55:44,863 --> 00:55:48,230
What, you see an ass-head
of your own, do you?

808
00:55:49,334 --> 00:55:51,131
Bless thee, Bottom.
Bless thee.

809
00:55:51,203 --> 00:55:53,728
Thou art translated.

810
00:55:55,473 --> 00:55:57,031
Aah.

811
00:56:01,546 --> 00:56:03,639
Why do they run away?

812
00:56:05,317 --> 00:56:08,684
I see their knavery.

813
00:56:08,753 --> 00:56:10,880
This is to make an ass of me,

814
00:56:10,956 --> 00:56:13,424
to fright me, if they could,

815
00:56:13,491 --> 00:56:14,958
but I will not stir
from this place,

816
00:56:15,026 --> 00:56:17,221
do what they can.

817
00:56:17,295 --> 00:56:18,455
And I will sing

818
00:56:18,530 --> 00:56:20,964
that they shall hear
I am not afraid.

819
00:56:23,635 --> 00:56:27,196
*The woosel cock
so black of hue *

820
00:56:27,272 --> 00:56:29,467
* With orange-tawnybill *

821
00:56:29,541 --> 00:56:32,806
*The throstle
with his note so true *

822
00:56:32,878 --> 00:56:37,178
*The wren with little quill *

823
00:56:39,351 --> 00:56:44,254
What Ã¡ngel wakes me
from my flowery bed?

824
00:56:44,322 --> 00:56:46,415
*The finch,the sparrow
and the lark *

825
00:56:46,491 --> 00:56:48,254
*The plain-song cuckoo gray *

826
00:56:48,326 --> 00:56:51,762
* Whose note so many
a man doth mark *

827
00:56:51,830 --> 00:56:54,526
* And dares not answer nay *

828
00:56:55,901 --> 00:56:58,734
I pray thee, gentle mortal,
sing again.

829
00:56:58,803 --> 00:57:01,135
Mine earis much enamored

830
00:57:01,206 --> 00:57:02,696
of thy note.

831
00:57:02,774 --> 00:57:03,900
So is mine eye

832
00:57:03,975 --> 00:57:06,170
enthralled to thy shape,

833
00:57:06,244 --> 00:57:09,577
and thy fair virtues
force, per force,

834
00:57:09,648 --> 00:57:11,809
doth move me, on the first view,

835
00:57:11,883 --> 00:57:15,842
to say...to swear,

836
00:57:15,921 --> 00:57:17,513
I love thee.

837
00:57:22,327 --> 00:57:24,192
M- M-Me thinks, mistress,

838
00:57:24,262 --> 00:57:26,730
you should have
little reason for that,

839
00:57:26,798 --> 00:57:28,595
and yet,

840
00:57:28,667 --> 00:57:30,532
to say the truth,

841
00:57:30,602 --> 00:57:34,504
reason and love keep little
company together nowadays.

842
00:57:36,107 --> 00:57:38,837
Nay, I can gleek,
upon occasiÃ³n.

843
00:57:40,912 --> 00:57:44,541
Thou art as wise
as thou art beautiful.

844
00:57:44,616 --> 00:57:47,244
Not so, neither.

845
00:57:56,161 --> 00:57:57,685
If I have wit enough
to get out of this wood,

846
00:57:57,762 --> 00:57:59,957
I have enough to serve
mine own turn.

847
00:58:00,031 --> 00:58:02,932
Out of this wood
do not desire to go.

848
00:58:08,506 --> 00:58:10,235
Oh!

849
00:58:10,308 --> 00:58:12,299
Aah!

850
00:58:12,377 --> 00:58:14,072
Thou shalt remain here,

851
00:58:14,145 --> 00:58:16,204
whether thou wilt or no.

852
00:58:19,117 --> 00:58:23,816
I'll give thee fairies
to attend on thee,

853
00:58:23,888 --> 00:58:27,289
and they shall fetch thee jewels

854
00:58:27,359 --> 00:58:29,350
from the deep

855
00:58:29,427 --> 00:58:31,258
and sing while thou

856
00:58:31,329 --> 00:58:34,958
on pressed flowers dost sleep,

857
00:58:35,033 --> 00:58:40,630
and I will purge
thy mortal grossness so

858
00:58:40,705 --> 00:58:45,768
that thou shalt
like an airy spirit go.

859
00:58:47,779 --> 00:58:50,270
Peaseblossom! Cobweb.

860
00:58:50,348 --> 00:58:51,713
- Ready.
- And I.

861
00:58:51,783 --> 00:58:53,683
Moth and Mustardseed.

862
00:58:53,752 --> 00:58:55,242
- And I.
- And I.

863
00:58:59,891 --> 00:59:02,086
Where shall we go?

864
00:59:08,433 --> 00:59:12,164
Be kind and courteous
to this gentleman.

865
00:59:12,237 --> 00:59:16,037
Hop in his walks
and gambol in his eyes.

866
00:59:16,107 --> 00:59:19,474
Feed him with apricocks
and dewberries,

867
00:59:19,544 --> 00:59:21,535
with purple grapes,
green figs,

868
00:59:21,613 --> 00:59:23,979
and mulberries.

869
00:59:24,049 --> 00:59:27,712
Nod to him, elves,
and do him courtesies.

870
00:59:27,786 --> 00:59:31,153
I cry your worship's mercy
heartily.

871
00:59:31,222 --> 00:59:32,712
I beseech your worship's name.

872
00:59:32,791 --> 00:59:34,315
Cobweb.

873
00:59:34,392 --> 00:59:36,121
I shall desire you
of more acquaintance,

874
00:59:36,194 --> 00:59:38,389
good Cobweb.

875
00:59:38,463 --> 00:59:40,829
If I cut my finger,
I shall make bold-

876
00:59:40,899 --> 00:59:41,831
Your name, I pray you.

877
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:43,060
Mustardseed.

878
00:59:43,134 --> 00:59:45,034
Oh, I know your patience well.

879
00:59:45,103 --> 00:59:46,661
Your kindred have made my eyes

880
00:59:46,738 --> 00:59:48,000
waterere now.

881
00:59:48,073 --> 00:59:49,335
I shall desire you
of more acquaintance,

882
00:59:49,407 --> 00:59:50,567
Mustardseed.

883
01:00:12,530 --> 01:00:14,225
Hail, mortal.

884
01:00:14,299 --> 01:00:16,859
Hail, mortal.

885
01:00:16,935 --> 01:00:19,028
Hail, mortal.

886
01:00:19,104 --> 01:00:23,438
Hail, hail, hail.

887
01:00:51,035 --> 01:00:54,095
I wonder if Titania be awaked,

888
01:00:54,172 --> 01:00:57,369
then what it was
that next came in her eye

889
01:00:57,442 --> 01:01:00,843
which she must dote on
in extremity.

890
01:01:02,847 --> 01:01:05,407
How now, mad spirit?

891
01:01:05,483 --> 01:01:09,010
What night-rule now
about this haunted grove?

892
01:01:09,087 --> 01:01:12,545
My mistress with a monster
is in love.

893
01:01:20,331 --> 01:01:23,391
This falls out better
than I could devise.

894
01:01:25,537 --> 01:01:27,402
But hast thou yet latched
the Athenian's eyes

895
01:01:27,472 --> 01:01:29,201
with the love-juice,
as I did bid thee do?

896
01:01:29,274 --> 01:01:30,298
I took him sleeping.

897
01:01:30,375 --> 01:01:31,808
That is finished,too.

898
01:01:31,876 --> 01:01:33,036
Demetrius:...so bitter...

899
01:01:33,111 --> 01:01:34,544
Stand close.

900
01:01:34,612 --> 01:01:36,307
Now I but chide.

901
01:01:36,381 --> 01:01:37,780
But I should use thee worse,
for thou, I fear,

902
01:01:37,849 --> 01:01:39,441
has given me cause to curse.

903
01:01:39,517 --> 01:01:41,382
If thou hast slain Lysander
in his sleep,

904
01:01:41,452 --> 01:01:43,010
being o'er shoes in blood,

905
01:01:43,087 --> 01:01:46,147
plunge in the deep,
and kill me,too.

906
01:01:46,224 --> 01:01:48,021
This is the same Athenian.

907
01:01:48,092 --> 01:01:50,026
This is the woman...

908
01:01:50,094 --> 01:01:51,026
Uh-huh.

909
01:01:51,095 --> 01:01:52,187
But not this the man.

910
01:01:52,263 --> 01:01:54,094
The sun was not
so true unto the day

911
01:01:54,165 --> 01:01:56,565
as he to me.

912
01:01:56,634 --> 01:02:00,468
Would he have stolen away
from sleeping Hermia?

913
01:02:00,538 --> 01:02:02,836
Where is he?

914
01:02:02,907 --> 01:02:05,432
Good Demetrius,
wilt thou give him me?

915
01:02:05,510 --> 01:02:08,001
I had rather give
his carcass to my hounds.

916
01:02:08,079 --> 01:02:10,206
Ohh. Out, dog.

917
01:02:10,281 --> 01:02:12,181
Out, cur.

918
01:02:14,085 --> 01:02:15,950
Thou drivest me past the bounds

919
01:02:16,020 --> 01:02:18,215
of maiden's patience.

920
01:02:18,289 --> 01:02:19,984
And hast thou killed him
while sleeping?
