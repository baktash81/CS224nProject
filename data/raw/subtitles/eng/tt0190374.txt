1
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:28,080
The Empire of Izmer
has long been a divided land.

2
00:00:28,327 --> 00:00:32,669
Ruled by the Mages,
an elite group of magic users.

3
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:36,059
The lowly Commoners,
those without magic...

4
00:00:36,102 --> 00:00:38,655
are little more than slaves.

5
00:00:38,693 --> 00:00:41,344
Izmer's young Empress Savina...

6
00:00:41,381 --> 00:00:45,309
wishes equality
and prosperity for all.

7
00:00:45,348 --> 00:00:50,529
But the evil Mage Profion
has other intentions.

8
00:02:51,022 --> 00:02:53,226
At last!

9
00:02:54,765 --> 00:02:56,422
Come, Damodar.

10
00:03:05,802 --> 00:03:06,948
Release him.

11
00:03:43,363 --> 00:03:46,046
You are mine now.

12
00:03:48,035 --> 00:03:49,692
Come to me!

13
00:04:00,097 --> 00:04:03,229
Yes, I told you
it could be done.

14
00:04:03,264 --> 00:04:06,841
You have the power
of the Immortals.

15
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:10,142
You can control Dragons.

16
00:04:10,176 --> 00:04:12,248
With a Dragon army
at my command...

17
00:04:12,286 --> 00:04:13,848
I can crush the Empress...

18
00:04:13,887 --> 00:04:16,025
and control
what is rightfully mine!

19
00:04:17,342 --> 00:04:19,229
You don't like that, do you?

20
00:04:19,262 --> 00:04:20,473
Good!

21
00:04:20,509 --> 00:04:23,324
I can use every ounce
of your rage!

22
00:04:24,733 --> 00:04:25,943
Come on.

23
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,955
Follow me.

24
00:04:28,924 --> 00:04:30,201
Follow me!

25
00:04:31,805 --> 00:04:33,942
I said follow me!

26
00:05:01,941 --> 00:05:04,276
What now, my lord Profion?

27
00:05:04,309 --> 00:05:08,334
We shall have to modify
our plans.

28
00:05:08,373 --> 00:05:11,820
Summon the High Council of Mages
immediately.

29
00:05:11,861 --> 00:05:15,438
They're about to learn something
of our young Empress...

30
00:05:15,475 --> 00:05:18,409
that may give them pause
for thought.

31
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:20,043
It will be done.

32
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:34,028
This must be some
twisted magic experiment...

33
00:05:34,063 --> 00:05:36,484
gone seriously wrong.

34
00:05:36,526 --> 00:05:38,086
Why is it every time
something bad happens...

35
00:05:38,127 --> 00:05:39,687
you blame the Mages?

36
00:05:39,726 --> 00:05:42,444
When was the last time
you saw a river catch on fire?

37
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:45,064
You think they care
if anyone got hurt?

38
00:05:45,102 --> 00:05:48,843
I'd love to find a way to give
those Mages some payback.

39
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:53,223
''Ridley the Savior.''

40
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:55,528
That'll be the day.

41
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:58,181
Look, Ridley,
things are the way they are.

42
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,106
There's nothing
you can do to change it.

43
00:06:00,139 --> 00:06:02,691
You got your haves
and your have-nots.

44
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:04,519
We are your gotta-gets.

45
00:06:04,554 --> 00:06:07,652
And right about now,
we gotta get paid.

46
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:11,431
The Magic School.

47
00:06:11,464 --> 00:06:12,839
The what?!

48
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:14,181
The Magic School?

49
00:06:14,215 --> 00:06:15,394
Are you crazy?

50
00:06:15,432 --> 00:06:16,861
We'll break
into the Magic School.

51
00:06:16,904 --> 00:06:18,113
Think of what we could get.

52
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:20,158
With the fire,
it won't be heavily guarded.

53
00:06:20,743 --> 00:06:23,045
Think of the challenge, Snails.

54
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:26,243
Think of what
we could find in there.

55
00:06:26,278 --> 00:06:28,067
If we pull this off...

56
00:06:28,102 --> 00:06:31,069
we'll be the envy
of every Thief in Sumdall.

57
00:06:32,037 --> 00:06:33,313
Trust me.

58
00:06:38,532 --> 00:06:41,631
Why would the Empress
want to disband this Council?

59
00:06:41,669 --> 00:06:44,318
It's a concept
I find difficult to believe.

60
00:06:44,355 --> 00:06:47,454
Azmath, your loyalty
is commendable...

61
00:06:47,492 --> 00:06:49,825
but we have all watched
the Empress' growing up...

62
00:06:49,859 --> 00:06:51,745
and we have all
heard her views...

63
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:54,910
on what she considers to be
the injustices of the land.

64
00:06:54,945 --> 00:06:57,497
But she is just a young woman.

65
00:06:57,537 --> 00:07:00,383
Young people speak
from the heart, not the mind.

66
00:07:00,417 --> 00:07:02,172
In time, with our counsel...

67
00:07:02,207 --> 00:07:05,719
she will come to understand
why things cannot be changed.

68
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:06,872
Maybe so.

69
00:07:06,911 --> 00:07:10,489
But is that a risk
you are willing to take?

70
00:07:10,527 --> 00:07:12,021
Her revolutionary ideas...

71
00:07:12,062 --> 00:07:14,101
have already taken root
among the people.

72
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:17,304
In time,
her influence will grow.

73
00:07:17,341 --> 00:07:19,195
As the months go by...

74
00:07:19,228 --> 00:07:22,097
she will learn to master
the powers of her Scepter.

75
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,082
When she does,
I have no doubt...

76
00:07:24,123 --> 00:07:27,439
she will use it
to enforce her changes upon us.

77
00:07:28,411 --> 00:07:30,298
What do you propose, Profion?

78
00:07:31,258 --> 00:07:36,243
I humbly ask that we vote
to remove the Scepter...

79
00:07:36,281 --> 00:07:39,249
from the Empress' control...

80
00:07:39,289 --> 00:07:42,834
so that government in Izmer
will remain secure.

81
00:07:42,872 --> 00:07:45,359
Remove the Scepter
which lolls above our heads...

82
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:48,334
and destroy the threat
of revolution forever!

83
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:53,678
And if she does not agree?

84
00:07:53,718 --> 00:07:55,179
Then...

85
00:07:56,470 --> 00:08:00,462
her true intentions
will become clear.

86
00:08:00,501 --> 00:08:05,038
And then we will be forced
to do whatever we must...

87
00:08:05,076 --> 00:08:09,744
to protect the strength
and unity of Izmer.

88
00:08:11,027 --> 00:08:12,619
What say you?

89
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,130
How could he get the Council
to turn against me?

90
00:08:29,168 --> 00:08:32,134
He plays on the fears
of the others--

91
00:08:32,175 --> 00:08:34,443
their fears of change.

92
00:08:34,478 --> 00:08:35,723
I know, Vildan...

93
00:08:35,758 --> 00:08:39,270
but the changes I propose
are for the good of the people.

94
00:08:39,308 --> 00:08:41,829
All people deserve
to be free and equal...

95
00:08:41,868 --> 00:08:44,203
whether Commoner or Mage.

96
00:08:44,236 --> 00:08:47,238
I know this within the depths
of my soul...

97
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:49,132
and if necessary...

98
00:08:49,164 --> 00:08:53,441
I would die to make that
the way Izmer is run.

99
00:08:53,484 --> 00:08:55,905
What can l do to stop Profion?

100
00:08:55,947 --> 00:08:58,598
You must outsmart him.

101
00:08:58,636 --> 00:09:01,700
Over the past years,
I have been searching...

102
00:09:01,738 --> 00:09:05,414
for an ancient artifact
called the Rod of Savrille.

103
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:07,970
It holds the same powers
as your Scepter...

104
00:09:08,009 --> 00:09:10,016
with one difference--

105
00:09:10,057 --> 00:09:12,805
It controls Red Dragons.

106
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,531
If you could obtain it...

107
00:09:14,568 --> 00:09:17,087
you could relinquish
your Scepter to the Council...

108
00:09:17,126 --> 00:09:19,647
and still have protection
against Profion.

109
00:09:19,687 --> 00:09:22,020
I must have
that Rod of Savrille!

110
00:09:22,054 --> 00:09:24,574
With one wave of it,
I will topple her...

111
00:09:24,613 --> 00:09:29,664
and bring down that useless
Council of idiots with her.

112
00:09:30,628 --> 00:09:33,497
What is your wish, my lord?

113
00:09:37,187 --> 00:09:41,823
Pay a visit to the Magic School
and see our friend Vildan.

114
00:09:41,858 --> 00:09:43,931
Persuade him to give you
the scroll of which he speaks...

115
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:46,556
and bring it here to me.

116
00:09:50,114 --> 00:09:51,422
And, Damodar...

117
00:09:52,386 --> 00:09:54,589
make sure that he's
no longer around...

118
00:09:54,624 --> 00:09:57,940
to give our young Empress
any more good advice.

119
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:02,811
Come, my friend.

120
00:10:09,565 --> 00:10:11,452
Ridley,
why it got to be so high?

121
00:10:11,484 --> 00:10:12,694
Snails, let go of me.

122
00:10:12,733 --> 00:10:14,969
Can't we just rob
the first floor next time?

123
00:10:15,005 --> 00:10:16,149
Hurry up.

124
00:10:16,188 --> 00:10:18,773
Why don't we just rob God
while we're up here?

125
00:10:18,811 --> 00:10:19,891
Come on, Snails.

126
00:10:19,931 --> 00:10:21,556
I thought you said
this was going to be easy.

127
00:10:21,595 --> 00:10:23,417
No, I said it wasn't impossible.

128
00:10:23,451 --> 00:10:25,142
That's the same thing
you said...

129
00:10:25,178 --> 00:10:26,640
when we robbed
that little Halfling's house.

130
00:10:26,683 --> 00:10:28,112
Who'd he catch? Me.

131
00:10:28,154 --> 00:10:30,063
Who'd he beat
from the waist down? Me.

132
00:10:30,106 --> 00:10:32,309
-Are you going to jump?
-You going to catch me?

133
00:10:32,346 --> 00:10:33,774
-I'm going to catch you.
-Promise?

134
00:10:33,817 --> 00:10:35,441
I promise. Now jump.

135
00:10:35,479 --> 00:10:36,593
All right.

136
00:10:40,312 --> 00:10:41,424
Sorry.

137
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:44,172
I thought l heard something.

138
00:10:44,215 --> 00:10:47,150
You did.
Me hitting the ground.

139
00:10:51,222 --> 00:10:52,715
That is a big Dragon.

140
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:57,678
Now we're talking.

141
00:10:58,868 --> 00:11:01,104
All right. Let's get to work.

142
00:11:10,324 --> 00:11:11,949
I've already told you, Marina.

143
00:11:11,987 --> 00:11:13,230
The Empress can't use...

144
00:11:13,265 --> 00:11:15,153
her Scepter
of Gold-Dragon control...

145
00:11:15,185 --> 00:11:18,032
or Profion will paint her
as a tyrant to the Council.

146
00:11:18,065 --> 00:11:21,227
Profion must be made
to expose himself to them.

147
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:23,598
Damn it, I know it's here.
Where is it?

148
00:11:23,632 --> 00:11:25,061
It should be right here.

149
00:11:25,104 --> 00:11:26,990
Are you sure you put it away
in its proper place?

150
00:11:27,023 --> 00:11:28,779
I'm sure.

151
00:11:28,815 --> 00:11:30,060
You're sure, are you?

152
00:11:30,095 --> 00:11:33,542
Then why is it filed here
with these volumes on alchemy?

153
00:11:33,582 --> 00:11:35,687
It belongs in Dracology.

154
00:11:35,726 --> 00:11:37,100
Where is it?

155
00:11:37,134 --> 00:11:39,021
I know I've got it somewhere.

156
00:11:39,054 --> 00:11:41,093
Ah, yes, this was it.

157
00:11:41,133 --> 00:11:43,238
Really, Marina,
you must stop dawdling.

158
00:11:43,277 --> 00:11:46,342
The Empress only has
three days until the Council...

159
00:11:46,381 --> 00:11:48,801
forces her to relinquish
her Scepter to them.

160
00:11:48,844 --> 00:11:50,534
-I'm sorry.
-That's all right.

161
00:11:50,572 --> 00:11:53,253
You must understand
the seriousness of our task.

162
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:55,494
I just feel like l should be
doing something more...

163
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:56,675
than shelving books.

164
00:11:56,713 --> 00:11:58,306
I understand, Marina...

165
00:11:58,345 --> 00:12:01,640
but you must learn
to be patient to maintain focus.

166
00:12:01,673 --> 00:12:04,193
That's the best help
you can provide just now.

167
00:12:04,233 --> 00:12:05,662
I suppose you're right.

168
00:12:13,351 --> 00:12:17,147
I never saw a scroll
so hard to decode!

169
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:19,361
It's protected
by very ancient magic.

170
00:12:19,398 --> 00:12:22,266
Marina,
fetch me some Manticore wing.

171
00:12:31,587 --> 00:12:33,474
-What is that?
-A Dragon tooth.

172
00:12:33,506 --> 00:12:35,328
-Put it back!
-Just a Dragon tooth.

173
00:12:35,362 --> 00:12:37,565
-Put it back.
-A Gold Dragon tooth?

174
00:12:37,601 --> 00:12:40,122
-It's too big. Put it back.
-Come on, Ridley.

175
00:12:55,071 --> 00:12:56,564
Here.

176
00:12:57,342 --> 00:12:59,382
What'd you give me
the rodent for?

177
00:12:59,422 --> 00:13:01,015
Pick it up! Come on.

178
00:13:01,854 --> 00:13:04,122
You already got enough of these
at your house.

179
00:13:04,156 --> 00:13:05,945
Look at this.

180
00:13:07,037 --> 00:13:10,003
We're going to be rich.

181
00:13:13,275 --> 00:13:15,314
You know how much
we could get for one of these?

182
00:13:15,355 --> 00:13:16,533
Don't touch that!

183
00:13:19,322 --> 00:13:22,355
One of the lab creatures
must have got loose again.

184
00:13:22,393 --> 00:13:23,800
Marina, check on it.

185
00:13:23,834 --> 00:13:24,978
Right.

186
00:13:29,816 --> 00:13:30,992
Snails, relax.

187
00:13:34,008 --> 00:13:35,120
It's an illusion.

188
00:13:37,048 --> 00:13:38,127
I knew that.

189
00:13:38,168 --> 00:13:39,728
Don't touch anything else!

190
00:13:39,767 --> 00:13:40,879
All right.

191
00:13:45,238 --> 00:13:47,180
What are you doing?

192
00:13:47,222 --> 00:13:48,848
We're the...

193
00:13:48,886 --> 00:13:51,406
The cleaning crew.

194
00:13:51,445 --> 00:13:52,525
Right.

195
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:54,387
This is dirty.

196
00:13:54,421 --> 00:13:56,492
Cleanup crew's more like it.

197
00:13:56,532 --> 00:13:58,671
You're Thieves trying to rob us.

198
00:14:06,099 --> 00:14:10,124
She must've put a holding spell
on us with that bracelet.

199
00:14:10,162 --> 00:14:12,649
It must be the only way she can
get guys to come home with her.

200
00:14:12,689 --> 00:14:14,576
I'd have to put a feeble-mind
spell on myself...

201
00:14:14,608 --> 00:14:16,168
to want to take you home.

202
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:18,567
That was funny.

203
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:20,015
You're going
to the city dungeon.

204
00:14:20,048 --> 00:14:21,160
That wasn't.

205
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:22,279
What a relief.

206
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:24,424
I'll be thanking you
when they cut my head off.

207
00:14:24,463 --> 00:14:26,700
You should.
It'd be an improvement.

208
00:14:28,239 --> 00:14:29,896
There's that superior
intelligence...

209
00:14:29,933 --> 00:14:31,755
you Mages are so famous for.

210
00:14:31,789 --> 00:14:34,125
Yes, well,
speaking of intelligence...

211
00:14:34,158 --> 00:14:36,840
what kind of genius
would break into a Magic School?

212
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,145
He'd have to be
really stupid or--

213
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:40,390
Or what?

214
00:14:40,428 --> 00:14:41,955
Well...

215
00:14:43,179 --> 00:14:44,357
Master!

216
00:14:47,818 --> 00:14:50,469
lf you don't tell me
which scroll it is...

217
00:14:50,506 --> 00:14:52,807
I'll have to kill you painfully.

218
00:14:52,841 --> 00:14:54,402
Never!

219
00:15:10,406 --> 00:15:12,893
Are you crazy?
You just zapped...

220
00:15:12,933 --> 00:15:14,559
The Chief
of the Crimson Brigade!

221
00:15:15,685 --> 00:15:17,627
To the streets of Sumdall!

222
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:20,706
Follow them, you fools!

223
00:15:20,741 --> 00:15:22,911
Where are we going?

224
00:15:26,818 --> 00:15:28,891
Hey, nice trick!

225
00:15:28,931 --> 00:15:30,360
No, the other way!

226
00:15:30,402 --> 00:15:33,152
Watch out!

227
00:15:40,449 --> 00:15:41,790
Lady, please, stop and listen.

228
00:15:41,824 --> 00:15:43,230
Escapes are
our bread and butter.

229
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,138
-What's that?
-I don't know!

230
00:15:50,175 --> 00:15:52,062
Get this rope off
so I can deal with it!

231
00:15:54,494 --> 00:15:57,811
Can't nobody get a moment
of peace around here?

232
00:15:57,855 --> 00:15:59,993
I ought to...

233
00:16:06,813 --> 00:16:08,089
Nice lid.

234
00:16:08,124 --> 00:16:09,947
You shouldn't have done that.

235
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,125
Check that door.

236
00:16:12,124 --> 00:16:14,066
It's locked! It's locked!

237
00:16:26,681 --> 00:16:28,087
Follow me!

238
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,226
If you think I'm going
in that filthy mess--

239
00:16:30,264 --> 00:16:31,376
That's disgusting!

240
00:16:39,926 --> 00:16:45,905
Post Brigades at every
sewer entrance and exit.

241
00:16:45,941 --> 00:16:49,038
I want them found...

242
00:16:49,397 --> 00:16:50,923
now.

243
00:16:54,548 --> 00:16:57,646
Marina of Pretensa,
student Mage...

244
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:01,359
is sought for the brutal murder
of Vildan Vildir.

245
00:17:01,394 --> 00:17:02,473
A reward will be...

246
00:17:02,513 --> 00:17:03,627
I can't believe this!

247
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:05,356
You better believe it.
They're framing us.

248
00:17:05,393 --> 00:17:07,084
They're framing you.
You're nothing but a Thief.

249
00:17:07,121 --> 00:17:09,870
They can't be framing me.
I'm an aristocrat. I'm a Mage.

250
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:12,174
A low-level Mage--
completely expendable.

251
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:14,096
Practically worthless.

252
00:17:14,128 --> 00:17:15,753
This is ridiculous.

253
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:17,765
I'll go to the authorities.

254
00:17:17,807 --> 00:17:19,847
I can't go to the authorities.

255
00:17:19,887 --> 00:17:22,057
That's right.
They'll toss you in prison...

256
00:17:22,094 --> 00:17:23,719
and torture you
till you confess.

257
00:17:23,758 --> 00:17:26,343
You better tell us,
'cause like the man said...

258
00:17:26,382 --> 00:17:27,843
we're your accomplices.

259
00:17:30,284 --> 00:17:31,626
All right.

260
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:32,837
Come on!

261
00:17:50,121 --> 00:17:51,844
You allow...

262
00:17:51,881 --> 00:17:55,077
a slip of a girl
to escape you...

263
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,461
with the scroll...

264
00:17:58,504 --> 00:18:02,300
and now Norda,
the Empress' finest tracker...

265
00:18:02,343 --> 00:18:03,936
is in pursuit...

266
00:18:05,254 --> 00:18:09,890
and you tell me
not to concern myself?

267
00:18:09,926 --> 00:18:12,511
It was a mistake.

268
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:15,810
It will not happen again.

269
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:17,469
There you are right.

270
00:18:19,588 --> 00:18:21,311
And here's why...

271
00:19:01,085 --> 00:19:04,630
Just a friend I'm sending along
for the ride.

272
00:19:04,668 --> 00:19:08,758
A gentle reminder
not to make any more mistakes.

273
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:12,021
The moment you deliver me
the Rod...

274
00:19:12,058 --> 00:19:14,327
I'll ensure that he--

275
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:15,605
it...

276
00:19:15,642 --> 00:19:17,136
vacate the premises.

277
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,142
Now...

278
00:19:21,176 --> 00:19:23,444
may l suggest...

279
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:27,091
that once you two have become
fully acquainted...

280
00:19:27,127 --> 00:19:29,615
you follow the Empress'
tracker Norda.

281
00:19:29,655 --> 00:19:32,273
She happens to be good
at her job.

282
00:19:32,311 --> 00:19:35,125
She will lead you
to our missing friends...

283
00:19:35,158 --> 00:19:36,434
and the scroll...

284
00:19:36,469 --> 00:19:39,436
and this time, Damodar...

285
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:42,030
don't fail me.

286
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:12,869
It's about time!

287
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:23,081
If we find the Rod, the Empress
heaps us with gold, huh?

288
00:20:25,101 --> 00:20:27,882
Why don't you try and rise above
being a Dwarf?

289
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:31,396
This isn't about gold.
It's about saving our Empire.

290
00:20:31,435 --> 00:20:33,638
Empire?
Who cares about the Empire?

291
00:20:33,675 --> 00:20:36,544
You Mages are the only ones
who benefit from it.

292
00:20:36,586 --> 00:20:38,724
Oh, really? That's
an interesting sentiment...

293
00:20:38,762 --> 00:20:40,670
coming from a guy
who steals things for a living.

294
00:20:42,539 --> 00:20:45,287
Have you ever heard
of honor amongst Thieves?

295
00:20:45,321 --> 00:20:48,190
We might live outside the law,
but we respect each other.

296
00:20:48,233 --> 00:20:51,746
Unlike a bunch
of back-stabbing Mages.

297
00:20:51,785 --> 00:20:55,167
That is just the sort of
half-baked, illiterate drivel...

298
00:20:55,209 --> 00:20:58,623
that proves Commoners
really are common.

299
00:20:59,783 --> 00:21:01,953
That's it. We're out of here.
Come on, Snails.

300
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:04,325
We'll go into hiding.
She can find the Rod herself.

301
00:21:04,358 --> 00:21:05,787
Fine.

302
00:21:12,132 --> 00:21:13,594
I thought you were leaving.

303
00:21:13,636 --> 00:21:15,392
Mind if we eat first?

304
00:21:15,428 --> 00:21:17,501
No. Be my guest.

305
00:21:25,571 --> 00:21:27,577
Those red marks there
look like the locks...

306
00:21:27,618 --> 00:21:29,822
my father used to put on plans
in his carriages.

307
00:21:29,858 --> 00:21:31,679
Please.

308
00:21:31,713 --> 00:21:35,836
This is an ancient scroll,
not a blueprint for a bucket.

309
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:37,759
You don't seem to know
what you're doing...

310
00:21:37,792 --> 00:21:39,930
so you might as well let me
have a look.

311
00:21:39,967 --> 00:21:41,855
Give that back!

312
00:21:41,887 --> 00:21:44,407
Let's see. He used to put
his fingers like this...

313
00:21:44,446 --> 00:21:46,137
and then he'd say
something like...

314
00:21:46,174 --> 00:21:49,469
Alanor, salah--
What was that word?

315
00:21:49,502 --> 00:21:50,581
Bidet.

316
00:21:50,621 --> 00:21:53,206
Bidet? Bidara! Bidara.

317
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:56,540
Alanor, salah, bidara!

318
00:22:01,563 --> 00:22:03,767
Can't blame me for trying.
At least I--

319
00:22:11,418 --> 00:22:13,872
See that there?
I knew that boy had talent!

320
00:22:16,536 --> 00:22:19,154
Alanor, salah, bidara!

321
00:22:43,955 --> 00:22:46,605
Do not let them escape...

322
00:22:46,643 --> 00:22:49,806
or you will suffer
a fate far worse...

323
00:22:49,843 --> 00:22:53,965
than that which hath
been inflicted upon me.

324
00:22:54,001 --> 00:22:59,052
So there I am, hogtied,
lying on my back.

325
00:23:00,049 --> 00:23:02,666
This Orc starts poking me
with the spear.

326
00:23:02,704 --> 00:23:05,126
Kind of a no-win situation.

327
00:23:05,168 --> 00:23:08,233
So, I say to myself,
''What do l got to lose?''

328
00:23:08,272 --> 00:23:10,606
So, I take that spear
and bite it.

329
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,330
And I start chewing.

330
00:23:18,127 --> 00:23:19,980
Idol of idols.

331
00:23:24,493 --> 00:23:26,315
With an Elf.

332
00:23:26,349 --> 00:23:28,519
You got to be kidding.

333
00:23:28,555 --> 00:23:32,035
The problem with Elves is
they got no meat on their bones.

334
00:23:32,076 --> 00:23:35,555
You got to get yourself
a nice 250-pound Dwarf.

335
00:23:35,594 --> 00:23:39,424
With hair on her chin
you can hang on to.

336
00:23:56,359 --> 00:23:57,635
Excuse me, little man.

337
00:24:03,461 --> 00:24:05,347
You looking for somebody
in particular?

338
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:07,585
Or are you just looking for...

339
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,890
somebody?

340
00:24:11,171 --> 00:24:12,993
Actually...

341
00:24:13,027 --> 00:24:15,329
I'm looking for someone
just like you.

342
00:24:17,251 --> 00:24:18,810
What a coincidence...

343
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:21,119
'cause I was looking for someone
just like you.

344
00:24:21,154 --> 00:24:23,324
We got to celebrate.

345
00:24:23,361 --> 00:24:27,516
Bartender, give me a bottle
of your best wine.

346
00:24:29,088 --> 00:24:30,332
Make that your cheapest.

347
00:25:00,281 --> 00:25:01,874
Wait.

348
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:05,943
I need the girl.

349
00:25:12,856 --> 00:25:14,263
Bar fight!

350
00:25:19,223 --> 00:25:20,532
Get them !

351
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:22,899
This ain't the time for romance!

352
00:25:22,934 --> 00:25:25,137
-What are you doing?
-Come on! Come on!

353
00:25:28,214 --> 00:25:30,385
Wait, I got to go back.
I think I'm in love!

354
00:25:30,422 --> 00:25:32,625
With an Elf?
They think Humans are a joke!

355
00:25:32,661 --> 00:25:34,417
All right, I lied.
I just want to hit it!

356
00:25:44,755 --> 00:25:47,340
Let's get Ridley out of here.

357
00:25:47,378 --> 00:25:49,646
Bidet, bidet, bidet.

358
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:52,653
That Wraith
must have been defective.

359
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:54,696
-He seemed reliable to me.
-He did not.

360
00:25:59,216 --> 00:26:01,485
It's Damodar, man.
He's onto us.

361
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:04,301
With what we've walked into,
everyone's going to be onto us.

362
00:26:04,335 --> 00:26:06,855
What do you mean,
everybody's onto us?

363
00:26:06,894 --> 00:26:08,967
Go ahead.
Tell him what you got us into.

364
00:26:09,006 --> 00:26:10,795
Me? But you--

365
00:26:11,758 --> 00:26:14,660
Go ahead.
Tell me what you got us into.

366
00:26:14,701 --> 00:26:16,707
According to the Wraith
inside the scroll...

367
00:26:16,748 --> 00:26:19,367
the Rod we're looking for
caused the Great War.

368
00:26:21,388 --> 00:26:22,631
Is that all?

369
00:26:24,235 --> 00:26:26,057
Have you lost your damn mind?

370
00:26:27,019 --> 00:26:29,473
What does this Rod do?

371
00:26:29,514 --> 00:26:32,481
It's supposed to have the power
to control Red Dragons.

372
00:26:32,522 --> 00:26:33,983
I don't know about you...

373
00:26:34,025 --> 00:26:35,934
but this sound
like a pretty bad idea to me.

374
00:26:35,977 --> 00:26:37,220
It gets better.

375
00:26:37,257 --> 00:26:39,231
This map
leads to a Dragon temple.

376
00:26:39,273 --> 00:26:41,826
To get in, we have to get
the Eye of the Dragon...

377
00:26:41,865 --> 00:26:43,457
from the Guildmaster
of the Thieves Guild...

378
00:26:43,495 --> 00:26:44,989
in Antius City.

379
00:26:45,031 --> 00:26:46,112
Xilus?

380
00:26:46,151 --> 00:26:47,231
No. Get--

381
00:26:47,271 --> 00:26:48,417
No way!

382
00:26:48,455 --> 00:26:49,698
I told her she's crazy...

383
00:26:49,735 --> 00:26:52,352
but she keeps going on about
Profion and the Empress.

384
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:53,600
Profion?

385
00:26:53,638 --> 00:26:55,525
They can
take care of themselves.

386
00:26:55,558 --> 00:26:56,735
I suggest we lay low...

387
00:26:56,773 --> 00:26:59,936
let the whole thing blow over,
come back, rob everybody.

388
00:26:59,973 --> 00:27:01,914
That's all. Let's go.

389
00:27:01,956 --> 00:27:04,344
Snails,
there's one more small problem.

390
00:27:07,715 --> 00:27:09,787
Problem?

391
00:27:09,827 --> 00:27:11,353
What's the problem, Ridley?

392
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:16,758
I kind of committed us
to find it.

393
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:20,794
Ridley, how could you
do something like that?

394
00:27:25,375 --> 00:27:27,066
You--

395
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:31,803
I can't believe this.

396
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:34,107
I can't believe--

397
00:27:34,142 --> 00:27:37,109
''This is our big chance, huh?

398
00:27:37,149 --> 00:27:39,222
''Let's rob the magic school.
This is our big chance!''

399
00:27:39,261 --> 00:27:40,689
That's what you said to me,
right?

400
00:27:40,732 --> 00:27:41,812
This is...

401
00:27:41,853 --> 00:27:43,826
dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb.

402
00:27:43,868 --> 00:27:45,079
Dumb!

403
00:27:45,117 --> 00:27:47,930
I got a new name for dumb.
''Ridley.''

404
00:27:47,963 --> 00:27:50,417
This is the Ridley-est thing
I ever heard of.

405
00:27:52,923 --> 00:27:55,029
I'll understand
if you don't want to go.

406
00:27:56,794 --> 00:27:58,420
What do you mean I can't go?

407
00:28:00,634 --> 00:28:03,022
Look, all I'm saying is that...

408
00:28:03,065 --> 00:28:06,993
don't you think this is just
a little bit out of our league?

409
00:28:07,033 --> 00:28:08,244
Just a little bit?

410
00:28:08,281 --> 00:28:09,808
Snails, listen to me, OK?

411
00:28:09,849 --> 00:28:11,987
This Eye of the Dragon
we're supposed to get?

412
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:14,412
It's a ruby
the size of your fist.

413
00:28:14,456 --> 00:28:16,365
I don't--

414
00:28:16,407 --> 00:28:18,294
A ruby the size of a fist?

415
00:28:18,326 --> 00:28:21,621
Yeah. We'll use her to help us
get it, and we'll take off.

416
00:28:21,654 --> 00:28:23,344
We'll make a fortune.

417
00:28:25,685 --> 00:28:26,863
Trust me.

418
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,704
I hate when you say that!

419
00:28:38,387 --> 00:28:40,656
Ridley, I know I'll regret this.

420
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:43,275
I knew you'd come
through for me!

421
00:28:43,313 --> 00:28:45,255
Don't touch me.

422
00:28:45,297 --> 00:28:46,672
OK, just a little bit.

423
00:28:46,705 --> 00:28:48,298
We're in.

424
00:28:49,745 --> 00:28:51,785
How about you?

425
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:57,413
I don't see what choice I have.

426
00:28:57,456 --> 00:29:01,230
Just tell me one thing--
lf I help, who'll pay me?

427
00:29:05,006 --> 00:29:09,032
We'll worry about that later.

428
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:17,321
That's a terrible way
to do business.

429
00:29:41,671 --> 00:29:44,387
I didn't do it.
I didn't do it!

430
00:29:44,422 --> 00:29:45,764
Get out of here!

431
00:30:09,409 --> 00:30:10,686
Ridley, check it out.

432
00:30:13,569 --> 00:30:15,227
Let's go.

433
00:30:37,533 --> 00:30:40,794
Listen, we're looking for
esteemed Guildmaster Xilus.

434
00:30:40,829 --> 00:30:42,170
We thought you'd know him.

435
00:30:42,205 --> 00:30:44,212
The only thing I know is...

436
00:30:44,252 --> 00:30:46,520
you ought to take your business
out of town...

437
00:30:46,556 --> 00:30:50,036
before you get the words
''outsiders not appreciated''...

438
00:30:50,075 --> 00:30:53,554
branded right where
your nose used to be.

439
00:30:53,595 --> 00:30:54,969
Get it?

440
00:30:59,481 --> 00:31:01,107
Thanks for your time!

441
00:31:02,744 --> 00:31:05,646
lf I ain't drinking,
you sure ain't shopping!

442
00:31:05,688 --> 00:31:07,095
Come on!

443
00:31:09,911 --> 00:31:12,278
There you are!
Where have you been?

444
00:31:12,311 --> 00:31:14,284
Don't look at us, all right?

445
00:31:14,327 --> 00:31:15,536
We're just shopping.

446
00:31:15,574 --> 00:31:17,842
Is that three-eyed
hyphen bastard watching us?

447
00:31:21,908 --> 00:31:23,315
If we follow him...

448
00:31:23,349 --> 00:31:24,941
he'll probably lead us
into the Guild.

449
00:31:26,196 --> 00:31:27,308
There he goes.

450
00:31:27,347 --> 00:31:29,234
Let's go.

451
00:31:51,983 --> 00:31:53,096
Come on.

452
00:32:10,891 --> 00:32:13,312
Elwood, we'll go in.
You keep a lookout.

453
00:32:23,113 --> 00:32:24,454
Nice.

454
00:32:27,464 --> 00:32:29,351
Isn't that Tollum?

455
00:32:29,384 --> 00:32:31,488
The guy
that kidnapped the Duke of--

456
00:32:34,631 --> 00:32:36,573
Let's keep 'em walking.

457
00:32:37,735 --> 00:32:39,077
Let's go find Xilus.

458
00:32:39,112 --> 00:32:40,486
That won't be necessary.

459
00:32:41,926 --> 00:32:44,229
Like I said,
''Outsiders not appreciated.''

460
00:32:44,263 --> 00:32:45,636
You was talking to us?

461
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:47,164
We was confused
'cause your third eye...

462
00:32:47,206 --> 00:32:48,667
was looking at somebody
completely different.

463
00:32:48,709 --> 00:32:50,052
Take 'em away!

464
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:53,505
Don't touch me!

465
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:55,580
Get off me! Get off of me!

466
00:32:59,843 --> 00:33:01,567
Where do you think
they took Snails?

467
00:33:01,603 --> 00:33:04,701
Don't worry. He'll be fine.
Just let me do the talking.

468
00:33:04,739 --> 00:33:06,331
So this is it?

469
00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:08,441
Everything a Thief strives for?

470
00:33:10,498 --> 00:33:12,123
You must be Xilus.

471
00:33:12,161 --> 00:33:14,682
Ridley Freeborn. Practitioner
of the larcenous crafts.

472
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,437
Member in good standing
of the Sumdall Guild.

473
00:33:17,471 --> 00:33:20,439
It's a pleasure to meet you.

474
00:33:20,479 --> 00:33:22,334
A fellow Thief.

475
00:33:22,368 --> 00:33:25,018
The pleasure's all mine.

476
00:33:25,054 --> 00:33:26,363
See?

477
00:33:26,398 --> 00:33:27,892
Sumdall, eh?

478
00:33:27,934 --> 00:33:29,876
How is old Sumdall?

479
00:33:29,918 --> 00:33:32,121
That's a pretty tough town,
isn't it?

480
00:33:32,157 --> 00:33:33,684
All those Mages.

481
00:33:33,725 --> 00:33:35,284
We get by.

482
00:33:35,325 --> 00:33:37,692
Yes, well, I think you
must be very accomplished...

483
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:41,204
to have such a precious morsel
traveling with you.

484
00:33:43,324 --> 00:33:46,137
What might I do for you?

485
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:47,730
The unity of our kingdom--

486
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:51,414
We understand you have something
called the Eye of the Dragon.

487
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:52,911
We desperately need it.

488
00:33:54,168 --> 00:33:57,812
Yes, well, I'm always happy
to help a fellow Thief.

489
00:33:57,848 --> 00:34:01,808
Have you ever heard
of the Antius Guild Maze?

490
00:34:03,064 --> 00:34:05,813
Of course.
Every Thief has heard of it.

491
00:34:05,847 --> 00:34:07,091
Wonderful.

492
00:34:07,127 --> 00:34:09,810
Then you'll know
that the Eye of the Dragon...

493
00:34:09,846 --> 00:34:12,846
is the prize at the center
of my Guild Maze, won't you?

494
00:34:12,886 --> 00:34:16,082
You finish the maze,
you win the prize.

495
00:34:16,118 --> 00:34:18,605
Has anyone ever
finished it before?

496
00:34:21,172 --> 00:34:23,081
They all died trying.

497
00:34:23,124 --> 00:34:25,938
But look on the bright side.

498
00:34:25,971 --> 00:34:28,304
At least the prize
is still there.

499
00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:31,943
Good health.

500
00:34:31,985 --> 00:34:33,839
And jolly good luck.

501
00:35:00,492 --> 00:35:02,664
This is a good one, Ridley.

502
00:35:15,594 --> 00:35:17,317
That's no fair!

503
00:36:03,585 --> 00:36:05,919
-I give him forty seconds.
-Nah, a minute.

504
00:36:05,953 --> 00:36:08,374
I can't believe they're betting
on whether or not he lives.

505
00:36:08,417 --> 00:36:10,010
Au contraire, precious morsel.

506
00:36:10,048 --> 00:36:12,633
They're betting on
how long before he dies.

507
00:36:35,387 --> 00:36:37,329
Be careful, Ridley!

508
00:36:55,767 --> 00:36:57,174
Oh, my.

509
00:36:57,207 --> 00:36:59,477
This is not right!

510
00:37:01,143 --> 00:37:03,346
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Very clever.

511
00:37:03,382 --> 00:37:04,625
But is clever enough?

512
00:37:04,662 --> 00:37:06,964
Come on,
the game ain't over yet.

513
00:38:41,508 --> 00:38:43,580
Very light on his feet,
isn't he?

514
00:38:50,914 --> 00:38:52,856
What kind of vault is that?

515
00:39:20,445 --> 00:39:22,811
I think she needs
to visit her friend.

516
00:39:58,839 --> 00:40:00,048
Nice.

517
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:06,766
Well, yes, yes, yes.

518
00:40:06,806 --> 00:40:09,260
Very clever. Well done, you.

519
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:11,667
-You were absolutely amazing.
-Thank you.

520
00:40:11,701 --> 00:40:13,707
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Thank you.

521
00:40:13,748 --> 00:40:17,194
I waited fifteen years
for someone to pick that lock.

522
00:40:17,235 --> 00:40:19,755
I knew the man
that could survive that maze...

523
00:40:19,795 --> 00:40:21,453
would be able to
get into that vault.

524
00:40:21,491 --> 00:40:23,050
And now, here he is.

525
00:40:23,089 --> 00:40:25,577
The man. You.

526
00:40:25,618 --> 00:40:29,927
Why don't you give me
what's rightfully mine?

527
00:40:31,601 --> 00:40:33,739
What about honor
amongst Thieves?

528
00:40:35,856 --> 00:40:38,791
What a romantic notion.

529
00:40:38,832 --> 00:40:41,765
Do you honestly believe
I could've amassed my wealth...

530
00:40:41,806 --> 00:40:43,181
if I worried about honor?

531
00:40:45,101 --> 00:40:47,141
So, pretty boy...

532
00:40:47,181 --> 00:40:48,610
if you don't want Hugo here...

533
00:40:48,653 --> 00:40:51,499
to rearrange your features
for you...

534
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:53,987
I suggest you just give it up.

535
00:40:59,915 --> 00:41:02,119
Who the hell is he?

536
00:41:02,155 --> 00:41:03,715
Who the hell are you?

537
00:41:12,232 --> 00:41:13,825
I don't know who you are...

538
00:41:13,864 --> 00:41:16,767
but be prepared
for a lesson in pain.

539
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:23,134
You must be joking.

540
00:41:23,175 --> 00:41:28,476
I never joke when Mages trespass
in my Guild!

541
00:41:33,894 --> 00:41:35,803
This is the map you're after.

542
00:41:37,477 --> 00:41:40,476
Clear a path,
and I'll put it out.

543
00:41:45,443 --> 00:41:46,652
Do it.

544
00:43:00,821 --> 00:43:02,065
Let go of me!

545
00:43:18,738 --> 00:43:20,079
You OK?

546
00:43:20,882 --> 00:43:22,091
We got to save Marina.

547
00:43:23,057 --> 00:43:25,129
Wait. What about the Dwarf?

548
00:43:25,168 --> 00:43:27,688
You get the Dwarf,
I'll get the girl.

549
00:43:27,727 --> 00:43:30,575
Wait. How come I always
got to get the Dwarf?

550
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:31,719
Damn!

551
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:49,224
Ridley, we already
have the Dragon's Eye.

552
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:51,148
Let's take it to Sumdall
and sell it.

553
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:53,035
Snails, we're not leaving
without Marina.

554
00:43:53,068 --> 00:43:54,955
Listen to you, Ridley!

555
00:43:54,987 --> 00:43:56,711
You're going to risk your life
for a Mage?

556
00:43:56,747 --> 00:43:58,175
Listen, Snails--

557
00:43:58,218 --> 00:43:59,364
What?

558
00:44:01,577 --> 00:44:03,465
I wouldn't do that...

559
00:44:04,553 --> 00:44:06,114
if I were you.

560
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:17,726
Hey, it's you.

561
00:44:18,854 --> 00:44:20,195
You know her?

562
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:21,408
We're acquainted.

563
00:44:21,447 --> 00:44:23,682
Is that the Elf
you were drooling over?

564
00:44:23,718 --> 00:44:25,441
I wouldn't put it that way.

565
00:44:25,477 --> 00:44:27,201
But, yeah, that's her.
Pretty, huh?

566
00:44:27,237 --> 00:44:29,211
They all look alike to me.

567
00:44:29,252 --> 00:44:31,107
Silence!

568
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:33,506
Where is the girl?

569
00:44:33,539 --> 00:44:34,784
None of your business.

570
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:37,373
Wrong, Human.

571
00:44:37,412 --> 00:44:40,760
It is my business to arrest you
and Marina of Pretensa...

572
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:43,552
and to take you
and the scroll you stole...

573
00:44:43,587 --> 00:44:45,212
back to the Empress of Izmer.

574
00:44:47,075 --> 00:44:49,944
So you're the law, are you?

575
00:44:49,986 --> 00:44:51,414
I should have known.

576
00:44:51,457 --> 00:44:53,082
One of your fellow lawmen--

577
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:54,746
in fact, the Chief
of the Crimson Brigade--

578
00:44:54,784 --> 00:44:56,377
beat you to the punch.

579
00:44:56,416 --> 00:44:58,456
He just took off with Marina!

580
00:44:58,496 --> 00:45:00,829
-Damodar.
-That's him.

581
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:02,718
Only he's not working
for the law anymore.

582
00:45:02,751 --> 00:45:05,173
He's working for Profion.

583
00:45:05,215 --> 00:45:08,857
He's the one you want, not us.

584
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:26,354
Your Majesty.

585
00:45:27,995 --> 00:45:30,928
Yes, Norda.
Have you found me the scroll?

586
00:45:30,970 --> 00:45:32,432
No, Your Highness.

587
00:45:32,473 --> 00:45:35,123
I have unfortunate tidings
to report.

588
00:45:35,161 --> 00:45:38,870
It seems Profion
also seeks the Rod.

589
00:45:38,905 --> 00:45:40,758
But how could he know?

590
00:45:40,791 --> 00:45:42,547
I do not know, milady.

591
00:45:42,583 --> 00:45:45,103
Damodar has captured
Marina of Pretensa...

592
00:45:45,142 --> 00:45:46,484
and the scroll...

593
00:45:46,518 --> 00:45:49,714
but I have her companions
in my custody.

594
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:51,158
What is your command?

595
00:45:53,812 --> 00:45:56,682
Seek Damodar out.

596
00:45:56,725 --> 00:45:58,613
We need that Rod.

597
00:45:58,645 --> 00:46:02,288
The Council demands my response
imminently.

598
00:46:02,324 --> 00:46:05,323
Norda, please hurry.

599
00:46:05,363 --> 00:46:06,988
Our time is running out.

600
00:46:07,027 --> 00:46:09,001
As you wish.

601
00:46:18,193 --> 00:46:20,200
Gather the horses.

602
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:21,898
We will track Damodar.

603
00:46:23,184 --> 00:46:25,157
They will travel with us.

604
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:27,784
Should they try to escape...

605
00:46:27,823 --> 00:46:29,197
kill them.

606
00:46:51,179 --> 00:46:52,553
Tell me...

607
00:46:53,738 --> 00:46:56,869
Why were you
at the Thieves Guild?

608
00:46:56,906 --> 00:47:00,932
It isn't exactly
a sightseeing spot, is it?

609
00:47:03,402 --> 00:47:06,881
We needed money for supplies.

610
00:47:19,622 --> 00:47:22,142
You'll have to do better
than that.

611
00:47:26,373 --> 00:47:28,096
I'm curious.

612
00:47:29,252 --> 00:47:31,521
You're a Mage...

613
00:47:31,556 --> 00:47:36,378
and yet you're
disgracing your family...

614
00:47:36,419 --> 00:47:39,352
by consorting with Thieves.

615
00:47:39,393 --> 00:47:44,543
You're a disgrace to Izmer,
conspiring against the Empress.

616
00:47:46,337 --> 00:47:49,206
I have no dispute with her.

617
00:47:49,249 --> 00:47:50,676
You know me.

618
00:47:50,719 --> 00:47:56,022
I have served her family loyally
for many a year.

619
00:47:57,439 --> 00:48:01,628
It is Profion's desire
to dethrone her...

620
00:48:02,878 --> 00:48:05,017
not mine.

621
00:48:06,045 --> 00:48:08,794
Then why do you help him?

622
00:48:14,844 --> 00:48:18,105
Look at me.

623
00:48:19,322 --> 00:48:21,810
Look at me!

624
00:48:24,217 --> 00:48:28,146
If I do not obtain the Rod...

625
00:48:28,186 --> 00:48:30,257
I will die.

626
00:48:30,297 --> 00:48:33,395
Please...

627
00:48:33,432 --> 00:48:36,279
help me.

628
00:48:39,095 --> 00:48:41,135
I'm sorry, but I...

629
00:48:41,175 --> 00:48:43,443
I cannot help you.

630
00:48:50,325 --> 00:48:52,429
Foolish girl.

631
00:48:54,324 --> 00:48:56,844
I can suck...

632
00:48:56,884 --> 00:49:00,200
the information I want...

633
00:49:00,244 --> 00:49:02,827
right out of you.

634
00:49:21,647 --> 00:49:24,331
Your friends have procured...

635
00:49:24,367 --> 00:49:27,715
the Eye of the Dragon...

636
00:49:27,758 --> 00:49:30,824
from the Thieves Maze.

637
00:49:32,557 --> 00:49:35,306
A key...

638
00:49:35,341 --> 00:49:36,934
of some sort.

639
00:50:00,073 --> 00:50:03,106
Can't I just walk?

640
00:50:03,144 --> 00:50:07,617
Don't you people know Dwarves
are terrified of horses?

641
00:50:07,655 --> 00:50:08,768
Get over it.

642
00:50:10,471 --> 00:50:12,544
A lot of Dwarves are afraid
to show their true feelings.

643
00:50:12,582 --> 00:50:14,305
I'm not, OK?

644
00:50:37,729 --> 00:50:39,768
They followed the valley.

645
00:50:39,809 --> 00:50:41,401
I know these lands.

646
00:50:41,441 --> 00:50:43,131
There's a shortcut up ahead.

647
00:50:43,169 --> 00:50:45,437
Through the forest
and over those hills.

648
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:49,079
It means leaving the trail...

649
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:52,218
but if Damodar sets up camp
and we ride all night...

650
00:50:52,255 --> 00:50:55,157
we stand a good chance
of cutting him off.

651
00:50:55,198 --> 00:50:56,758
All right, let's go.

652
00:50:59,485 --> 00:51:02,900
I love the way you track.

653
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:05,810
You wouldn't happen
to be single, are you?

654
00:51:05,853 --> 00:51:07,195
What?

655
00:51:07,228 --> 00:51:09,562
There's no harm in asking
is there?

656
00:51:09,595 --> 00:51:11,505
It just so happens
that I'm single.

657
00:51:11,548 --> 00:51:13,685
Can you believe it?

658
00:51:13,723 --> 00:51:15,730
How old are you?

659
00:51:15,770 --> 00:51:18,322
Twenty-three. l know
I'm a little young for you.

660
00:51:18,361 --> 00:51:20,631
What if I get my hands
on an aging potion?

661
00:51:20,666 --> 00:51:22,552
I'll sacrifice
a couple of years for you.

662
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:26,673
I'm 234.

663
00:51:26,713 --> 00:51:29,330
Oh, damn.

664
00:51:29,367 --> 00:51:31,505
I didn't mean
that much of a change.

665
00:51:48,117 --> 00:51:49,263
Hurry.

666
00:51:57,012 --> 00:51:58,538
Ridley, look--Beholders.

667
00:51:58,578 --> 00:52:01,197
Relax, Snails.
We'll just sneak around 'em.

668
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:10,887
Now what?

669
00:52:10,928 --> 00:52:13,677
A little distraction.

670
00:52:30,892 --> 00:52:32,834
All right, Snails, stay close.

671
00:52:41,386 --> 00:52:42,597
All clear.

672
00:52:51,721 --> 00:52:55,103
OK. I'll get Marina.
You get the map.

673
00:52:55,145 --> 00:52:56,671
OK. Hey, wait, Ridley.

674
00:52:56,712 --> 00:52:58,599
How you get the girl
and I get a map?

675
00:52:58,631 --> 00:53:00,289
We got to work out
some new plans.

676
00:53:00,327 --> 00:53:01,439
Go.

677
00:53:09,159 --> 00:53:11,012
Be careful.

678
00:53:12,486 --> 00:53:13,630
All right.

679
00:53:16,164 --> 00:53:18,717
You, too.

680
00:53:30,402 --> 00:53:31,579
Let's go in.

681
00:53:33,569 --> 00:53:36,383
We were not meant
to enter this place.

682
00:53:37,664 --> 00:53:41,012
This task
they must complete alone.

683
00:54:00,347 --> 00:54:02,933
I'm Damodar.

684
00:54:29,176 --> 00:54:32,470
A little black magic.

685
00:54:41,142 --> 00:54:43,214
All right, Damodar.

686
00:54:43,253 --> 00:54:45,936
Nice.

687
00:54:50,003 --> 00:54:52,937
Piece of cake.

688
00:55:00,242 --> 00:55:02,663
I knew this was too easy.

689
00:55:15,918 --> 00:55:18,536
Need a hand?

690
00:56:26,497 --> 00:56:27,872
It's OK.

691
00:56:34,848 --> 00:56:37,215
Let's get you out of here.

692
00:56:37,248 --> 00:56:38,677
Come on.

693
00:56:50,878 --> 00:56:53,333
Just like you Thieves.

694
00:56:53,373 --> 00:56:56,885
Always taking things
that don't belong to you.

695
00:56:56,924 --> 00:56:59,193
All right. Now...

696
00:56:59,227 --> 00:57:01,561
I'm mad.

697
00:57:01,596 --> 00:57:05,458
You want to play, do you?

698
00:57:05,499 --> 00:57:08,117
Yeah. Let's play.

699
00:57:09,403 --> 00:57:12,500
OK, you win. Game over.

700
00:57:34,645 --> 00:57:35,724
There they are!

701
00:57:35,765 --> 00:57:38,154
So much for getting
out of here without a fight.

702
00:57:47,059 --> 00:57:48,336
Thanks.

703
00:57:48,371 --> 00:57:49,713
Anytime.

704
00:58:15,342 --> 00:58:18,156
Hit him ! Hit him !

705
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:46,948
Let's go!

706
00:59:22,530 --> 00:59:23,807
Come on.

707
00:59:27,489 --> 00:59:30,305
You cannot be serious.

708
00:59:30,337 --> 00:59:32,278
I've never been so serious.

709
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:35,037
Oh, please.

710
00:59:57,851 --> 01:00:02,105
If you'll give me
the Dragon's Eye...

711
01:00:02,139 --> 01:00:04,889
I might decide...

712
01:00:04,922 --> 01:00:06,962
to let you die quickly.

713
01:00:08,312 --> 01:00:09,425
Go to hell!

714
01:00:47,665 --> 01:00:51,820
Not your usual punctual self.

715
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:56,135
Where's my Dragon's Eye?

716
01:01:02,735 --> 01:01:04,141
I have it.

717
01:01:04,175 --> 01:01:07,022
Really?

718
01:01:07,054 --> 01:01:09,028
Show it to me.

719
01:01:13,741 --> 01:01:15,715
Let him go first,
and it's yours.

720
01:01:22,733 --> 01:01:24,390
Snails, don't!

721
01:01:54,087 --> 01:01:57,468
Make it easy on yourself.

722
01:01:57,510 --> 01:02:00,640
Give me what is mine.

723
01:02:04,099 --> 01:02:05,474
Never!

724
01:02:05,508 --> 01:02:08,190
You're as stubborn
as your friend.

725
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:13,054
Very well.

726
01:02:14,946 --> 01:02:17,335
You've made your choice.

727
01:02:23,137 --> 01:02:24,282
Come on, Ridley!

728
01:02:29,023 --> 01:02:30,517
Transporting!

729
01:02:34,686 --> 01:02:36,596
Come on, Ridley!

730
01:02:36,638 --> 01:02:38,808
Come on!

731
01:03:05,528 --> 01:03:09,040
The Council has voted.
You must oblige us.

732
01:03:10,232 --> 01:03:12,719
You understand the consequences
of your decision--

733
01:03:12,759 --> 01:03:15,247
Do not patronize me, Azmath...

734
01:03:15,287 --> 01:03:18,003
for I understand all too well.

735
01:03:20,021 --> 01:03:24,276
Yes, I violate the law
in defying the Council...

736
01:03:24,309 --> 01:03:27,156
but if I were
to give you this Scepter...

737
01:03:27,189 --> 01:03:30,058
my crime would be graver yet...

738
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:32,489
for I would be
defying my conscience...

739
01:03:32,532 --> 01:03:34,539
and our people.

740
01:03:36,691 --> 01:03:38,926
Have you all forgotten?

741
01:03:38,963 --> 01:03:43,305
This Council was created to
protect the people of Izmer...

742
01:03:43,347 --> 01:03:44,524
but ask yourselves...

743
01:03:44,562 --> 01:03:47,180
Is this what you are doing?

744
01:03:47,217 --> 01:03:50,184
I say not.

745
01:03:50,225 --> 01:03:53,160
Your concern
is only for yourselves...

746
01:03:53,201 --> 01:03:54,794
not the people.

747
01:03:54,832 --> 01:03:57,069
And Your Majesty
is forcing the Empire...

748
01:03:57,104 --> 01:03:58,564
to the verge of civil war...

749
01:03:58,608 --> 01:04:00,430
in the best interests
of the people?

750
01:04:00,463 --> 01:04:04,719
The man who convinced you
to take the Scepter from me...

751
01:04:04,751 --> 01:04:08,045
so that he would leave
the state defenseless.

752
01:04:09,325 --> 01:04:11,300
Be careful, my friends...

753
01:04:11,342 --> 01:04:15,334
for once he's done with me,
this Council may be next.

754
01:04:18,764 --> 01:04:21,153
War benefits no one, Profion...

755
01:04:21,196 --> 01:04:22,984
and I oppose it.

756
01:04:24,554 --> 01:04:28,002
But if it is necessary to obtain
the freedom of our people...

757
01:04:29,514 --> 01:04:33,637
then no cost could be too great
to achieve that goal.

758
01:04:33,673 --> 01:04:35,943
Do you hear her words?

759
01:04:35,977 --> 01:04:39,554
She violates our highest law!

760
01:04:39,591 --> 01:04:43,366
And then seeks to force us
into submission...

761
01:04:43,399 --> 01:04:45,951
with a threat of war.

762
01:04:45,990 --> 01:04:49,820
Each citizen of Izmer,
whether a Commoner or a Mage...

763
01:04:49,862 --> 01:04:53,603
deserves an equal right
for prosperity...

764
01:04:53,637 --> 01:04:55,491
and as Empress...

765
01:04:55,525 --> 01:04:59,386
this is how I decree
Izmer shall be run...

766
01:04:59,428 --> 01:05:02,657
from this day forward.

767
01:05:02,691 --> 01:05:04,000
Such pretty words.

768
01:05:04,035 --> 01:05:07,230
My friends, I warned you...

769
01:05:07,266 --> 01:05:10,234
that this headstrong child...

770
01:05:11,682 --> 01:05:14,431
will defy you and destroy you.

771
01:05:14,465 --> 01:05:18,773
Her youth
denies her the wisdom...

772
01:05:18,816 --> 01:05:22,361
to understand why
some things cannot change...

773
01:05:22,399 --> 01:05:25,595
but idealism is for children...

774
01:05:25,631 --> 01:05:30,966
and a child is not fit
to govern an Empire.

775
01:05:31,007 --> 01:05:33,145
I ask you one last time!

776
01:05:33,182 --> 01:05:36,498
Will you submit
to the ruling of this Council...

777
01:05:36,541 --> 01:05:38,875
and relinquish your Scepter?

778
01:05:38,908 --> 01:05:41,079
I was praying...

779
01:05:41,115 --> 01:05:43,057
that you would
find the wisdom...

780
01:05:43,100 --> 01:05:46,644
to see that the path
I propose for Izmer...

781
01:05:46,682 --> 01:05:49,617
is the right one.

782
01:05:50,618 --> 01:05:52,657
I do not wish to fight you...

783
01:05:52,697 --> 01:05:56,722
but I will not
leave the Empire...

784
01:05:56,761 --> 01:06:00,558
at the mercy
of an unscrupulous charlatan!

785
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:05,815
So decide as you must,
but know one thing--

786
01:06:08,023 --> 01:06:10,577
I am not afraid.

787
01:06:24,916 --> 01:06:27,469
A wonderful performance.

788
01:06:27,508 --> 01:06:30,639
My friends, ask yourselves...

789
01:06:30,675 --> 01:06:33,260
are we prepared to see
our Empire...

790
01:06:33,299 --> 01:06:35,568
destroyed by a child?

791
01:06:38,354 --> 01:06:41,801
Then is now not the time
we should act?

792
01:06:43,186 --> 01:06:45,673
Then down with the tyrants...

793
01:06:45,713 --> 01:06:47,687
and let the war begin!

794
01:07:17,451 --> 01:07:18,693
What is he doing?

795
01:07:21,258 --> 01:07:23,843
Isn't he going to use
any spells?

796
01:07:23,881 --> 01:07:25,474
Wait.

797
01:07:55,619 --> 01:07:57,594
How did you do that?

798
01:07:57,635 --> 01:08:02,369
The Elven people do not require
spells to work with magic.

799
01:08:02,402 --> 01:08:05,305
You use magic.

800
01:08:06,529 --> 01:08:08,863
We are part of it.

801
01:08:10,817 --> 01:08:11,831
Part of magic?

802
01:08:11,872 --> 01:08:15,449
As are all living creatures,
including Dragons.

803
01:08:15,488 --> 01:08:20,605
Sadly, Humans see only
their destructive powers.

804
01:08:23,198 --> 01:08:25,053
I had a dream. I saw--

805
01:08:25,087 --> 01:08:27,028
You saw a Dragon being born.

806
01:08:27,069 --> 01:08:28,564
It was amazing.

807
01:08:29,791 --> 01:08:31,579
Life was exploding all around.

808
01:08:31,614 --> 01:08:32,954
So it should.

809
01:08:32,989 --> 01:08:36,250
You see, when Dragons are born,
they bring new magic with them.

810
01:08:36,285 --> 01:08:39,667
Magic is the life force
of our world.

811
01:08:39,708 --> 01:08:42,872
It keeps nature
and everything around us...

812
01:08:42,908 --> 01:08:45,046
in balance.

813
01:08:48,827 --> 01:08:50,714
And if many Dragons should die?

814
01:08:50,746 --> 01:08:55,252
Life would wither as it must...

815
01:08:55,290 --> 01:08:58,039
and the balance
would be destroyed.

816
01:08:58,072 --> 01:09:00,342
The Rod.

817
01:09:02,392 --> 01:09:04,082
You and your countrymen...

818
01:09:04,120 --> 01:09:07,054
are very close
to irreparably destroying...

819
01:09:07,094 --> 01:09:10,607
the fabric of magic
with this Rod you seek.

820
01:09:10,646 --> 01:09:13,101
The Rod is man-made...

821
01:09:13,141 --> 01:09:15,989
unnatural.

822
01:09:16,021 --> 01:09:18,410
It must not be disturbed.

823
01:09:21,524 --> 01:09:24,338
You must rest.

824
01:09:49,262 --> 01:09:52,458
I'm sorry about Snails.

825
01:09:56,685 --> 01:09:58,540
I'm sure you are.

826
01:10:03,181 --> 01:10:04,969
He died for a good cause.

827
01:10:05,005 --> 01:10:07,970
A good cause?

828
01:10:09,547 --> 01:10:12,482
What cause is that?

829
01:10:12,523 --> 01:10:15,337
The Empress against Profion?

830
01:10:18,154 --> 01:10:19,614
Politics.

831
01:10:21,577 --> 01:10:23,432
I'm through with all that.

832
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:28,479
I'm not going to die
over some power struggle...

833
01:10:28,519 --> 01:10:29,894
between a couple
of greedy Mages.

834
01:10:29,928 --> 01:10:31,683
No, you're wrong.

835
01:10:31,719 --> 01:10:34,566
No, you're wrong! Mage!

836
01:10:34,598 --> 01:10:36,932
You never had to live
on the other side.

837
01:10:36,965 --> 01:10:38,875
You know what?
Snails was right.

838
01:10:38,917 --> 01:10:40,542
There is nothing we can do
to change it...

839
01:10:40,581 --> 01:10:43,036
and if I had listened to him,
he would still be alive.

840
01:10:43,077 --> 01:10:45,498
Just because some Mages are evil
does not mean they all are.

841
01:10:45,540 --> 01:10:46,784
I'm not!

842
01:10:51,012 --> 01:10:53,881
Let me let you in
on a little secret.

843
01:10:53,923 --> 01:10:57,468
The Empress that Snails died for
stands to lose everything...

844
01:10:57,506 --> 01:10:59,993
because she is fighting
to change things.

845
01:11:00,034 --> 01:11:01,724
As if she has anything
to worry about.

846
01:11:04,258 --> 01:11:05,982
You are so naive.

847
01:11:07,873 --> 01:11:09,247
She risks everything...

848
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:11,647
because she does not believe
the system is fair.

849
01:11:11,681 --> 01:11:14,201
Profion seeks to dethrone her
because she believes...

850
01:11:14,240 --> 01:11:16,955
that Mages and Commoners
should be treated as equals.

851
01:11:16,991 --> 01:11:20,733
She is fighting to change
what you hate so much!

852
01:11:23,710 --> 01:11:27,354
That, Ridley,
is what Snails died for.

853
01:11:40,667 --> 01:11:44,278
When Vildan told me what was
happening with the Empress...

854
01:11:46,299 --> 01:11:49,461
I wanted to do
all l could to help her.

855
01:11:50,777 --> 01:11:52,849
But even then,
I did not understand...

856
01:11:52,889 --> 01:11:55,855
why she would want Commoners
to be equal with us.

857
01:11:59,608 --> 01:12:01,201
But now...

858
01:12:02,230 --> 01:12:05,264
after being with you
for only a few days...

859
01:12:05,302 --> 01:12:09,230
and seeing how you always manage
to find your way...

860
01:12:10,965 --> 01:12:13,866
I understand why the Empress
is right.

861
01:12:18,131 --> 01:12:20,236
Please, Ridley.

862
01:12:20,275 --> 01:12:23,308
Help me show them
we are not like they are.

863
01:12:30,864 --> 01:12:32,653
You know, for a Mage...

864
01:12:37,456 --> 01:12:39,463
you're pretty smart.

865
01:13:16,458 --> 01:13:19,457
It will protect you.

866
01:13:19,497 --> 01:13:21,537
Thank you.

867
01:13:57,282 --> 01:13:58,711
All right. This is it.

868
01:13:58,753 --> 01:14:01,089
This is the entrance
to the dungeon.

869
01:14:10,944 --> 01:14:12,219
What happened?

870
01:14:13,886 --> 01:14:15,032
What is it?

871
01:14:16,286 --> 01:14:18,970
It's a wall force of some kind.

872
01:14:19,006 --> 01:14:20,915
I've never seen
this kind of magic.

873
01:14:26,653 --> 01:14:28,561
Only you were meant to pass.

874
01:14:32,795 --> 01:14:35,665
I guess l go alone, then.

875
01:14:41,306 --> 01:14:42,646
Be careful.

876
01:14:42,681 --> 01:14:46,259
Don't worry. I'll be fine.

877
01:15:50,477 --> 01:15:51,524
Great.

878
01:15:53,582 --> 01:15:54,693
Now what?

879
01:17:32,666 --> 01:17:34,674
Sorry, Snails.

880
01:17:58,517 --> 01:18:00,589
Finally,
a Mage who got what he deserved.

881
01:18:03,094 --> 01:18:05,875
Why do you disturb
the Rod of Savrille?

882
01:18:07,413 --> 01:18:10,128
To save the Empire of Izmer.

883
01:18:11,284 --> 01:18:12,745
Who...

884
01:18:12,788 --> 01:18:14,313
What are you?

885
01:18:14,355 --> 01:18:17,072
I am Savrille,
creator of the Rod...

886
01:18:17,106 --> 01:18:20,237
cursed with the crime of trying
to control the Red Dragons...

887
01:18:20,275 --> 01:18:22,762
and sentenced
to this purgatory...

888
01:18:22,802 --> 01:18:26,576
until someone worthy
of its power takes it.

889
01:18:26,608 --> 01:18:28,812
You are such a man?

890
01:18:30,703 --> 01:18:32,678
I don't know
if anybody's such a man.

891
01:18:35,215 --> 01:18:37,003
But I'm going to find out.

892
01:18:38,190 --> 01:18:42,150
Be warned. Anyone who wields
the power of the Rod...

893
01:18:42,190 --> 01:18:44,393
shall suffer a horrible fate...

894
01:18:44,430 --> 01:18:47,146
for the evil it creates
cannot be undone...

895
01:18:47,181 --> 01:18:49,864
unless its spell is broken.

896
01:18:49,900 --> 01:18:51,145
How do I break the spell?

897
01:18:51,181 --> 01:18:54,562
That, you must discover.

898
01:20:06,429 --> 01:20:09,331
The Empress has called
her Dragons upon us.

899
01:20:12,701 --> 01:20:15,351
Don't just stand there
admiring them !

900
01:20:15,388 --> 01:20:16,599
Destroy them
before they reach us.

901
01:20:16,636 --> 01:20:18,010
Hurry! Hurry!

902
01:20:19,644 --> 01:20:21,367
Prepare to fire!

903
01:20:21,403 --> 01:20:22,647
Fire!

904
01:20:31,066 --> 01:20:32,408
Come on.

905
01:20:43,928 --> 01:20:46,961
Get up! Prepare to fire again!

906
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:48,786
Move that crossbow.

907
01:20:48,822 --> 01:20:51,572
Aim for their wings, you fools!

908
01:20:54,326 --> 01:20:56,463
Fire, you fools! Fire!

909
01:21:17,842 --> 01:21:19,630
What have I done?

910
01:21:25,039 --> 01:21:26,152
Come to me.

911
01:21:47,596 --> 01:21:49,352
I found the Rod!

912
01:21:50,732 --> 01:21:53,797
Thanks for saving me
the trouble.

913
01:22:07,688 --> 01:22:10,437
Feels good, doesn't it?

914
01:22:10,471 --> 01:22:11,813
Remember...

915
01:22:11,847 --> 01:22:16,932
your stupidity and persistence
got your Thief friend killed.

916
01:22:16,966 --> 01:22:18,624
Don't let it be responsible...

917
01:22:18,662 --> 01:22:21,923
for finishing off the rest
of your social circle.

918
01:22:26,468 --> 01:22:29,151
Oh, look.

919
01:22:29,187 --> 01:22:33,016
I've cut her. What a shame.

920
01:22:33,059 --> 01:22:34,368
Don't hurt her.

921
01:22:34,403 --> 01:22:36,704
Then give me the Rod!

922
01:22:36,738 --> 01:22:39,323
And you'll release them?

923
01:22:39,362 --> 01:22:42,111
Don't do it, Ridley.

924
01:22:45,249 --> 01:22:47,866
You have my word.

925
01:23:12,125 --> 01:23:14,393
Finally.

926
01:23:14,428 --> 01:23:16,370
You said you'd let them go!

927
01:23:20,187 --> 01:23:21,911
I lied.

928
01:23:21,947 --> 01:23:23,321
Kill them...

929
01:23:25,754 --> 01:23:27,794
slowly.

930
01:24:41,933 --> 01:24:45,095
Give that to me.

931
01:24:52,138 --> 01:24:54,724
You said you'd set me free.

932
01:25:03,431 --> 01:25:06,813
Now what about my head?

933
01:25:23,076 --> 01:25:24,734
Here they come!

934
01:25:28,548 --> 01:25:30,009
Come, Damodar.

935
01:25:30,051 --> 01:25:31,677
To the roof of Sumdall.

936
01:25:44,801 --> 01:25:46,207
Fire!

937
01:26:15,706 --> 01:26:19,001
My destiny.

938
01:26:22,297 --> 01:26:25,079
Come to me.

939
01:27:30,412 --> 01:27:33,162
Look. I've cut you.

940
01:27:33,196 --> 01:27:35,585
What a shame.

941
01:28:33,954 --> 01:28:36,474
You can run, Your Ladyship...

942
01:28:36,513 --> 01:28:40,309
but you'll never run far enough!

943
01:28:42,752 --> 01:28:48,153
Let their blood
rain from the sky!

944
01:28:58,109 --> 01:29:00,443
You'll pay for that, boy.

945
01:29:00,476 --> 01:29:04,053
You really think
that you can steal my destiny?

946
01:29:05,020 --> 01:29:08,697
I'll invent a new destiny
especially for you...

947
01:29:08,731 --> 01:29:09,907
full of pain.

948
01:29:10,875 --> 01:29:15,608
A new kind of pain
and new senses to feel it with.

949
01:29:15,641 --> 01:29:17,715
Not if I kill you first.

950
01:29:19,449 --> 01:29:23,190
This will be a real pleasure.

951
01:29:42,388 --> 01:29:44,177
Not so talented, eh, Mr. Ridley?

952
01:29:44,212 --> 01:29:48,467
I've enjoyed our little chat,
but now it's your time to die.

953
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:10,277
My little tracker.
I could--

954
01:30:11,281 --> 01:30:12,872
Hey, Mage!

955
01:30:12,913 --> 01:30:16,522
Why don't you pick on somebody
your own size?

956
01:30:19,215 --> 01:30:20,709
Back for more?

957
01:30:20,751 --> 01:30:24,099
You really think you can
use that, you little burglar?

958
01:30:43,050 --> 01:30:44,543
Well, that's impossible.

959
01:30:44,586 --> 01:30:47,456
Bring them down on him, Ridley!

960
01:30:47,498 --> 01:30:49,057
Destroy him !

961
01:31:10,724 --> 01:31:12,546
I won't become you.

962
01:31:18,979 --> 01:31:22,274
What have you done?

963
01:31:25,986 --> 01:31:29,215
Your Majesty.

964
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:35,775
It's over, Profion.

965
01:31:35,808 --> 01:31:39,037
The battle maybe, Your Majesty.

966
01:31:39,072 --> 01:31:40,697
Maybe...

967
01:31:42,719 --> 01:31:46,874
but not the war.

968
01:32:59,282 --> 01:33:00,459
Thank you.

969
01:33:28,331 --> 01:33:31,680
People of Izmer...

970
01:33:31,723 --> 01:33:36,937
at long last, I do declare
that you are now all equal.

971
01:33:36,970 --> 01:33:39,653
Let the celebration begin.

972
01:33:54,886 --> 01:33:56,642
You hear that, buddy?

973
01:33:58,854 --> 01:34:00,512
That's for you.

974
01:34:02,214 --> 01:34:05,279
Nothing's going to be the same
without you.

975
01:34:07,653 --> 01:34:09,856
But I guess I'll
have to get used to that.

976
01:34:11,620 --> 01:34:13,627
I just hope wherever you are...

977
01:34:15,459 --> 01:34:18,241
you know that you did
make a difference.

978
01:34:21,059 --> 01:34:22,553
You helped things change.

979
01:34:36,415 --> 01:34:39,578
You finally got it.

980
01:34:39,613 --> 01:34:41,042
Your big score.

981
01:34:49,054 --> 01:34:50,363
I guess I'd better get going...

982
01:34:50,397 --> 01:34:52,731
or I'm going to miss
my own knighting ceremony.

983
01:34:52,764 --> 01:34:54,619
Ridley the Savior.

984
01:34:54,653 --> 01:34:56,441
Can you believe it?

985
01:35:03,514 --> 01:35:05,172
I'm going to miss you, pal.

986
01:35:53,553 --> 01:35:56,814
Do not question your gift.

987
01:35:56,849 --> 01:35:58,921
Your friend awaits you.
