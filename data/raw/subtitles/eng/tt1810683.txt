1
00:01:00,027 --> 00:01:03,329
<i>This is O'Hare, California.</i>

2
00:01:07,835 --> 00:01:11,673
<i>Back then, it was nothing more
than a sleepy fishing village</i>

3
00:01:11,773 --> 00:01:13,640
<i>with a hill at the end of Main Street.</i>

4
00:01:17,011 --> 00:01:19,605
<i>Like you see in postcards.</i>

5
00:01:21,615 --> 00:01:24,386
<i>My story takes place on the home front,</i>

6
00:01:24,786 --> 00:01:27,253
<i>in the midst of World War II.</i>

7
00:01:29,657 --> 00:01:31,726
That's me...

8
00:01:32,026 --> 00:01:33,510
the little fella.

9
00:01:35,629 --> 00:01:37,430
Closer?

10
00:01:38,533 --> 00:01:41,698
Stop causing trouble, you midget.

11
00:01:42,687 --> 00:01:45,705
<i>Nobody in that town liked me much.</i>

12
00:01:50,411 --> 00:01:52,745
One, two, three.

13
00:01:54,298 --> 00:01:57,068
<i>I was eight years old.</i>

14
00:01:57,168 --> 00:02:00,853
<i>But the story really starts
the day I met my dad.</i>

15
00:02:02,089 --> 00:02:04,226
<i>My only friend.</i>

16
00:02:05,326 --> 00:02:07,195
<i>My partner.</i>

17
00:02:07,545 --> 00:02:08,813
He's a boy.

18
00:02:09,981 --> 00:02:12,784
- He's so...
- What? Little?

19
00:02:12,884 --> 00:02:15,253
Well, he'll grow.

20
00:02:15,353 --> 00:02:16,503
Right?

21
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,342
I got you covered, okay?

22
00:02:32,225 --> 00:02:34,469
'Cause we're partners.

23
00:02:38,876 --> 00:02:41,613
<i>I wanted to be just like him.</i>

24
00:02:42,113 --> 00:02:43,646
<i>And do everything he did.</i>

25
00:02:47,451 --> 00:02:51,954
<i>And everything we did
became a great adventure.</i>

26
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:58,796
Very proud of you, partner.
You handled the pain like a true hero.

27
00:02:58,896 --> 00:03:01,833
Actually, you remind me
of another hero...

28
00:03:02,133 --> 00:03:04,669
"Ben Eagle, The Magician."

29
00:03:04,969 --> 00:03:08,606
And Ben Eagle said to his sidekick,
"Do you believe you can do this?"

30
00:03:08,706 --> 00:03:13,259
<i>"Do you believe you can do this?"
That became our motto.</i>

31
00:03:20,218 --> 00:03:22,921
- Do you believe we can do this?
- Yes, I believe we can do this.

32
00:03:23,321 --> 00:03:25,788
Let's go, partner.

33
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:33,798
- The mast is broken.
- Partner, do you believe you can do this?

34
00:03:33,898 --> 00:03:35,834
Yes, I believe I can do this.

35
00:03:36,734 --> 00:03:40,588
- <i>This is the police.</i>
- Partner, do you believe we can do this?

36
00:03:40,688 --> 00:03:42,738
Yes, partner.

37
00:03:43,138 --> 00:03:45,939
Pepper. Pepper Flynt Busbee,

38
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:48,914
- I've been yelling for 20 minutes.
- <i>That's my mom.</i>

39
00:03:49,014 --> 00:03:51,182
Come on, we're in the middle
of a great story.

40
00:03:51,282 --> 00:03:53,918
<i>Always there to snap us back to reality.</i>

41
00:03:54,748 --> 00:03:56,786
It's time to go to bed.

42
00:03:58,555 --> 00:03:59,724
Come on.

43
00:04:01,202 --> 00:04:03,561
<i>And that's my brother, London.</i>

44
00:04:03,661 --> 00:04:07,599
<i>Finally old enough
to sign up for the fight.</i>

45
00:04:07,699 --> 00:04:11,100
- Bye, Mom.
- <i>All was good in the old Busbee home.</i>

46
00:04:14,752 --> 00:04:17,106
<i>Or so I thought.</i>

47
00:04:27,718 --> 00:04:30,224
The new "Ben Eagle"!

48
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:35,190
You gotta bring your quarter
for a look-see.

49
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:37,409
- What are you having, your usual today?
- Yeah, give me the usual.

50
00:04:37,509 --> 00:04:38,897
Me too.

51
00:04:39,697 --> 00:04:42,600
<i>The war was still raging.</i>

52
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,169
<i>The enemy has infiltrated the USA.</i>

53
00:04:45,269 --> 00:04:48,184
<i>Stupid American,
you know not what Tokyo do.</i>

54
00:04:48,284 --> 00:04:51,639
<i>Not on my watch, little fella.</i>

55
00:04:55,245 --> 00:04:59,084
<i>Everyone was pitching in,
doing their part.</i>

56
00:05:00,184 --> 00:05:04,689
<i>Uncle Sam had all the teens
lining up, ready to fight.</i>

57
00:05:04,789 --> 00:05:06,823
Busbee, London.

58
00:05:09,326 --> 00:05:11,162
Sorry, son. 4F.

59
00:05:11,961 --> 00:05:14,532
Hoffman, William.

60
00:05:14,632 --> 00:05:17,035
Sergeant, sir?

61
00:05:17,135 --> 00:05:21,139
With all due respect, what do flat feet
have to do with killing Japs?

62
00:05:21,239 --> 00:05:23,576
That's just the way it is, kid.

63
00:05:24,476 --> 00:05:25,739
Thanks.

64
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:28,388
Welcome to the US Army.

65
00:05:29,513 --> 00:05:32,481
Landry, Gene.

66
00:05:34,117 --> 00:05:36,455
How's the weather down there, "Midget"?

67
00:05:36,555 --> 00:05:38,297
Two vanillas.

68
00:05:39,557 --> 00:05:42,160
Hey, the world looks bigger
from down here.

69
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,496
He sure is small.

70
00:05:44,896 --> 00:05:47,829
Hey, where's your cane, "Tiny Tim"?

71
00:05:55,472 --> 00:05:59,108
- You think you're gonna buy 'em this time?
- No, not today.

72
00:06:14,691 --> 00:06:16,692
Piece of junk!

73
00:06:20,263 --> 00:06:22,467
4F. Stupid war.

74
00:06:23,067 --> 00:06:26,004
I can't let you do this, Dad.
This is my fight.

75
00:06:26,104 --> 00:06:29,856
- But you always knew one of us had to go.
- It was supposed to be me.

76
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:40,097
Come on, Lon.
Aren't you gonna eat anything?

77
00:06:45,922 --> 00:06:49,391
London's not going to war, right?

78
00:07:07,612 --> 00:07:11,416
Does that mean that...
you're going instead?

79
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:14,157
Yes.

80
00:07:15,532 --> 00:07:17,753
He'll be back before you know it.

81
00:07:20,024 --> 00:07:23,628
- Why can't we stay together?
- Partner, I have to go.

82
00:07:24,228 --> 00:07:26,162
I don't want you to go.

83
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:41,309
Time's up, privates.

84
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,704
You got nothing to blame yourself about.

85
00:08:06,804 --> 00:08:09,005
- You take care of yourself, okay?
- All right.

86
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:41,265
I'm not a midget, right?

87
00:09:41,765 --> 00:09:44,468
We shouldn't use that word.

88
00:09:44,568 --> 00:09:47,972
"Midget" is a mean word
for people with dwarfism.

89
00:09:48,072 --> 00:09:50,772
I'm afraid your son had something
to do with the nickname.

90
00:09:51,142 --> 00:09:53,011
- Mom!
- That's okay, Pepper.

91
00:09:53,111 --> 00:09:56,946
I will make sure Freddy
makes things right.

92
00:10:05,588 --> 00:10:07,559
Any news from James?

93
00:10:07,659 --> 00:10:10,995
He should be here on the 15th.
He said his tour would end by summer.

94
00:10:11,595 --> 00:10:14,529
That's what he said in his last letter.

95
00:10:19,135 --> 00:10:23,032
- Do I have dwarfism or what?
- You know what? Let's...

96
00:10:23,132 --> 00:10:26,844
just keep an eye on you. It's really
too soon to make any type of diagnosis.

97
00:10:26,944 --> 00:10:31,883
I will, however, suggest
we see each other regularly.

98
00:10:31,983 --> 00:10:36,117
But for now, Pepper,
let's just say you're a...

99
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,188
little boy.

100
00:10:47,297 --> 00:10:49,367
Teacup!

101
00:10:49,617 --> 00:10:51,385
Come on, get up.

102
00:10:52,835 --> 00:10:55,774
Mr. Jones yelled at me yesterday.

103
00:10:56,574 --> 00:11:00,745
He really blew a fuse about his car.
He said you were a...

104
00:11:01,245 --> 00:11:04,612
- You want to know what he called you?
- No, I don't.

105
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:09,718
Let's hear this baby hum.

106
00:11:27,803 --> 00:11:29,272
Why is this thing not working?

107
00:11:29,372 --> 00:11:32,243
The old one works fine.
Your dad was happy with it.

108
00:11:32,343 --> 00:11:34,245
What do you know?

109
00:11:35,144 --> 00:11:37,349
He's gonna love this.

110
00:11:37,449 --> 00:11:40,508
Now mind your own and get
the lousy Packard ready.

111
00:11:41,684 --> 00:11:43,905
- Can I go?
- Yeah, go.

112
00:11:44,005 --> 00:11:46,972
- Don't need your pestering, either.
- And what about my money?

113
00:11:47,072 --> 00:11:49,271
- I don't have any.
- But mom told you.

114
00:11:49,371 --> 00:11:53,813
"But mom told you." This ain't time
to be spending money like that.

115
00:12:07,243 --> 00:12:09,278
What a waste.

116
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:21,893
Dad's been eyeing these boots
for a long time, hasn't he?

117
00:12:21,993 --> 00:12:23,999
Yes, he has.

118
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:26,548
Thank you.

119
00:12:32,269 --> 00:12:36,840
Hi, Jenny. Can I have two tickets
for the "Ben Eagle Show"?

120
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:39,076
Does this mean your father's
coming back?

121
00:12:39,176 --> 00:12:42,611
Yeah, he should be here soon.
Bye, Jenny. Thank you.

122
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:58,927
Good morning, Mrs. Busbee.

123
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:04,201
On March 11th, your husband,

124
00:13:04,301 --> 00:13:08,272
James L. Busbee
was part of a tactical operation.

125
00:13:08,372 --> 00:13:13,275
His platoon was sent to secure Malabang,
a village in the Philippines.

126
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:29,725
I can't wait to see him. He's the best.

127
00:13:31,829 --> 00:13:35,464
Hey, look. It's the midget
who ratted on me.

128
00:13:39,537 --> 00:13:42,704
- Come on, let's get him!
- Get him!

129
00:13:45,876 --> 00:13:47,063
Fight!

130
00:14:01,891 --> 00:14:06,104
Midget! Midget! Midget!
Midget! Midget! Midget...

131
00:14:08,732 --> 00:14:10,207
Stop!

132
00:14:11,031 --> 00:14:15,037
We can't call him "midget."
It could traumatize him.

133
00:14:19,709 --> 00:14:21,743
Gimme that.

134
00:14:32,655 --> 00:14:36,695
In the name of the freakiest thing
alive, I baptize you,

135
00:14:36,795 --> 00:14:38,130
"Little Boy."

136
00:14:42,403 --> 00:14:44,565
Okay. Okay.

137
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:48,172
Is my husband dead or alive?

138
00:14:48,272 --> 00:14:51,909
We don't know, ma'am.
His body wasn't located at the scene.

139
00:14:52,009 --> 00:14:55,276
We believe he's been taken
as a prisoner of war.

140
00:15:00,885 --> 00:15:03,274
Good luck getting out.

141
00:15:35,276 --> 00:15:36,618
What's wrong?

142
00:16:37,113 --> 00:16:39,350
He's barely eaten all week.

143
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:42,784
Just take him, would you?

144
00:16:45,988 --> 00:16:49,660
He got the extra ticket for your dad.

145
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:52,574
Fine.

146
00:16:56,165 --> 00:17:00,171
<i>Elegant in his top hat
and floating cane,</i>

147
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,596
<i>Ben Eagle, the magician...</i>

148
00:17:04,525 --> 00:17:06,529
<i>is in reality...</i>

149
00:17:08,578 --> 00:17:11,549
<i>a super crime fighter!</i>

150
00:17:12,849 --> 00:17:14,518
<i>In today's episode,</i>

151
00:17:14,618 --> 00:17:19,028
<i>is Tyra finally safe
from the clutches of Sir Pent?</i>

152
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:34,371
Hey! Going for a drink.

153
00:17:34,904 --> 00:17:37,908
But the live show is next.

154
00:17:38,508 --> 00:17:43,714
<i>This is what happens
to Ben Eagle's precious interest.</i>

155
00:17:43,914 --> 00:17:45,266
<i>You'll never get away with it.</i>

156
00:17:45,366 --> 00:17:48,052
<i>What are we gonna do?
There are too many.</i>

157
00:17:48,152 --> 00:17:50,641
<i>Interpretation, Kid Falcon.</i>

158
00:17:50,741 --> 00:17:52,987
<i>I hope this works.</i>

159
00:18:02,932 --> 00:18:04,365
<i>Ben Eagle!</i>

160
00:18:06,052 --> 00:18:08,553
<i>Ben Eagle!</i>

161
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:18,146
And now, the moment of truth.

162
00:18:20,717 --> 00:18:22,184
I am searching.

163
00:18:24,287 --> 00:18:26,155
Searching for the one

164
00:18:26,275 --> 00:18:30,918
who the High Lama of Tibet told me
would be in this very room.

165
00:18:32,795 --> 00:18:35,246
- The chosen one.
- Me!

166
00:18:37,767 --> 00:18:39,552
You.

167
00:18:43,939 --> 00:18:46,075
Look who's here.

168
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:49,639
London.

169
00:18:49,739 --> 00:18:51,047
My boy.

170
00:18:51,148 --> 00:18:54,018
- Hey, Sam.
- Hey, London. The usual?

171
00:18:54,818 --> 00:18:58,089
What you are about to see
is not an illusion.

172
00:18:58,189 --> 00:19:02,259
You will bear witness
to a profound experience.

173
00:19:02,359 --> 00:19:05,763
The movement of an inanimate object

174
00:19:06,163 --> 00:19:08,252
through inner power.

175
00:19:08,352 --> 00:19:10,019
But I'm not gonna perform it.

176
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:12,867
My new colleague will.

177
00:19:40,196 --> 00:19:42,533
Now you have the power.

178
00:19:43,133 --> 00:19:46,868
It's up to you
to achieve the impossible.

179
00:19:50,659 --> 00:19:53,749
- But they're gonna make fun of me.
- Not if you move the bottle, they won't.

180
00:19:54,099 --> 00:19:56,513
You just do as I say.

181
00:19:58,898 --> 00:20:02,686
Raise your hands and point them
at the bottle. There.

182
00:20:02,886 --> 00:20:05,556
Get off the stage, runt!

183
00:20:05,656 --> 00:20:08,158
Ignore the world. Ignore the world.

184
00:20:08,258 --> 00:20:11,462
- Focus.
- Stand up, little boy.

185
00:20:11,562 --> 00:20:16,064
- He is standing.
- Get him a step stool.

186
00:20:25,107 --> 00:20:27,711
Do you believe you can do this?

187
00:20:28,211 --> 00:20:31,413
<i>Partner, do you believe you can do this?</i>

188
00:20:41,857 --> 00:20:44,462
Do you believe you can move it,
yes or no?

189
00:20:46,929 --> 00:20:49,867
Yes, I believe I can move the bottle.

190
00:20:49,967 --> 00:20:53,537
- I don't believe you.
- Yes, I believe I can move it!

191
00:20:53,637 --> 00:20:57,638
- Louder.
- Yes! I can move the bottle!

192
00:21:39,348 --> 00:21:43,320
That's the kind of faith that Moses had
when he parted the Red Sea...

193
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:46,516
the kind of faith that little David
had when he defeated Goliath

194
00:21:46,616 --> 00:21:48,659
with a little stone.

195
00:21:48,759 --> 00:21:52,595
That's what we need, my friends,
in these difficult times.

196
00:21:52,695 --> 00:21:56,800
So like Father Oliver used to ask,
"What can we do?

197
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:59,403
What can we do for our relatives at war?

198
00:22:00,803 --> 00:22:03,838
What can we do if we are here

199
00:22:03,938 --> 00:22:06,203
and they are there?

200
00:22:06,719 --> 00:22:07,990
And the answer is...

201
00:22:10,056 --> 00:22:14,050
if we have faith the size
of a mustard seed,

202
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:15,452
we can move a mountain.

203
00:22:16,248 --> 00:22:20,157
If we can move a mountain,
then nothing will be impossible for us.

204
00:22:20,657 --> 00:22:23,471
Not even ending this war...

205
00:22:24,394 --> 00:22:27,127
and having our loved ones back.

206
00:22:31,967 --> 00:22:35,572
<i>I already knew someone
who could move a mountain.</i>

207
00:22:35,672 --> 00:22:40,709
<i>I wondered if the source of his powers
was the mustard seed.</i>

208
00:22:58,594 --> 00:23:02,162
<i>This was a source of unlimited powers?</i>

209
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:08,035
<i>So if this was true,
this was all I needed to...</i>

210
00:23:13,575 --> 00:23:16,012
<i>And there he was...</i>

211
00:23:16,112 --> 00:23:17,984
<i>the enemy.</i>

212
00:23:19,015 --> 00:23:21,552
- London!
- What?

213
00:23:22,252 --> 00:23:25,678
There's a Jap at Gilliam's.

214
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:30,944
<i>I couldn't understand how one of them
was free in O'Hare.</i>

215
00:23:31,094 --> 00:23:33,562
<i>After Pearl Harbor,
they put them all in camps.</i>

216
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:40,070
<i>After years of internment,
the Army, in its wisdom,</i>

217
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:42,806
<i>has decided to release
those of Japanese ancestry</i>

218
00:23:42,906 --> 00:23:45,829
<i>who have proven loyal to the US.</i>

219
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:51,314
<i>They seem harmless, don't they?
But can we trust them?</i>

220
00:23:51,414 --> 00:23:56,784
<i>Well, I for one, remember Pearl Harbor,
so I say, "Remain vigilant."</i>

221
00:24:08,097 --> 00:24:10,536
Store doesn't serve Japs.

222
00:24:13,302 --> 00:24:15,970
Everything okay here?

223
00:24:21,676 --> 00:24:24,606
You forgot the onions, Hashimoto.
Put these on my tab.

224
00:24:24,706 --> 00:24:27,718
- Father, with all due respect...
- Now, Gilliam.

225
00:24:28,818 --> 00:24:31,955
- These too.
- Of course, Father.

226
00:24:32,055 --> 00:24:35,158
I'm getting sick and tired of hearing
again and again and again

227
00:24:35,258 --> 00:24:39,660
about Pearl Harbor and about how my son
"gave his life for his country."

228
00:24:40,863 --> 00:24:43,066
Because he didn't.

229
00:24:43,766 --> 00:24:46,567
Those Japs took his life.

230
00:24:48,038 --> 00:24:51,039
And they did it in the most
cowardly way you can imagine.

231
00:24:55,211 --> 00:24:58,191
We need to do something about that Jap.

232
00:25:00,516 --> 00:25:04,885
If I could, I would smash
every Jap with my bare hands.

233
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:37,292
That's the rat's dump.

234
00:25:38,553 --> 00:25:41,416
You want to smash him
with your bare hands?

235
00:25:43,725 --> 00:25:45,574
Here you go.

236
00:25:46,074 --> 00:25:47,979
Have at him.

237
00:25:49,565 --> 00:25:51,662
Go on.

238
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:16,682
There he is!

239
00:26:24,233 --> 00:26:27,067
Take that, dirty Jap!

240
00:26:31,273 --> 00:26:34,442
Maybe this'll let him know
that "slants" ain't welcome...

241
00:26:37,412 --> 00:26:42,250
<i>I finally understood why
they don't let flat feet into the Army.</i>

242
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:09,329
Five groups of 10 "Hail Marys"
and five "Our Fathers."

243
00:27:09,429 --> 00:27:11,431
In Latin.

244
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:16,390
<i>Sancta Maria, mater Dei,
ora pro nobis peccatoribus,</i>

245
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:19,912
<i>nunc, et in hora mortis nostrae.</i> Amen.

246
00:27:20,012 --> 00:27:21,897
Now you.

247
00:27:22,691 --> 00:27:24,653
In Latin?

248
00:27:26,295 --> 00:27:29,163
Thank God nothing happened to Hashimoto.

249
00:27:30,836 --> 00:27:33,771
- I've finished.
- Very good.

250
00:27:34,964 --> 00:27:35,906
Something else?

251
00:27:37,011 --> 00:27:39,842
The seed itself doesn't do anything.
What I said is...

252
00:27:40,042 --> 00:27:42,941
"If you have faith,
the invisible power"...

253
00:27:43,041 --> 00:27:46,714
- Like Ben Eagle's powers?
- "Ben Eagle"?

254
00:27:49,618 --> 00:27:53,086
Well, no, that's just fantasy.

255
00:28:00,129 --> 00:28:02,299
How can you say that?

256
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:05,888
I met Ben Eagle and he showed me
how to move a bottle.

257
00:28:06,987 --> 00:28:09,339
He can also move a mountain,
just like you said.

258
00:28:09,439 --> 00:28:14,546
No, no, no. That's not the same thing.
That's not faith. Let's see.

259
00:28:14,646 --> 00:28:19,442
- If you have faith, "fides" in Latin...
- Crispin...

260
00:28:20,242 --> 00:28:22,305
I'll take it from here.

261
00:28:23,585 --> 00:28:24,891
I understand.

262
00:28:29,157 --> 00:28:30,344
Take a seat.

263
00:28:36,198 --> 00:28:40,701
Why don't you show me
how you moved the bottle?

264
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:44,611
- You want to see?
- Yes, I do.

265
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:07,331
I guess that was stupid of me.

266
00:29:14,236 --> 00:29:16,523
Why don't you try again?

267
00:29:50,471 --> 00:29:52,272
Again.

268
00:30:10,692 --> 00:30:12,462
There, it moved.

269
00:30:14,232 --> 00:30:18,902
- No, you moved it.
- Yes, because you moved me to move it.

270
00:30:19,002 --> 00:30:23,607
See, I moved it because you wanted
the bottle to move so much.

271
00:30:23,707 --> 00:30:28,008
And that, you could say,
is how faith works.

272
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,867
At least some of the time.

273
00:30:31,547 --> 00:30:34,915
And this is as much as I need
to move a mountain?

274
00:30:38,186 --> 00:30:39,989
In theory, yes.

275
00:30:40,089 --> 00:30:43,293
But... it's up to Him.

276
00:30:43,693 --> 00:30:47,195
- He's the mover.
- How could I get bigger faith?

277
00:31:00,342 --> 00:31:03,713
The list, the ancient list.

278
00:31:03,813 --> 00:31:06,483
For centuries, people believed
that if you do this list,

279
00:31:06,583 --> 00:31:09,719
it'll make your faith... powerful.

280
00:31:09,819 --> 00:31:12,155
This is what you have to do.

281
00:31:12,255 --> 00:31:14,289
"Feed the hungry,

282
00:31:15,591 --> 00:31:17,727
shelter the homeless,

283
00:31:18,782 --> 00:31:20,830
visit those in prison,

284
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:24,901
- clothe the naked."
- Naked?

285
00:31:25,001 --> 00:31:27,804
How is that supposed to...

286
00:31:27,904 --> 00:31:30,107
"Visit the sick,

287
00:31:31,127 --> 00:31:32,540
bury the dead."

288
00:31:36,778 --> 00:31:38,615
Oh, just one more thing.

289
00:31:38,715 --> 00:31:41,217
In order to make this list work for you,

290
00:31:41,317 --> 00:31:47,088
I'm gonna add one essential item.

291
00:31:52,093 --> 00:31:55,565
"Befriend Hashimoto"?! Are you crazy?

292
00:31:55,665 --> 00:31:57,600
It's your choice, Pepper.

293
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:00,586
What does that Jap
have to do with anything?

294
00:32:01,137 --> 00:32:02,970
Everything.

295
00:32:04,439 --> 00:32:07,310
Your faith won't work

296
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:10,458
if you have even the slightest bit
of hatred in you.

297
00:32:16,318 --> 00:32:21,821
Fine. I'll do it if that's what
it takes to bring my dad back.

298
00:32:22,758 --> 00:32:25,665
- Come again?
- Bring my dad back.

299
00:32:27,229 --> 00:32:31,167
Yes, but only if it's God's will.

300
00:32:31,267 --> 00:32:34,435
Why wouldn't God
want to bring my dad back?

301
00:32:39,007 --> 00:32:40,543
I don't know.

302
00:32:40,643 --> 00:32:45,478
But if I get enough faith,
nothing's impossible, right?

303
00:32:49,317 --> 00:32:51,052
Yeah.

304
00:33:48,077 --> 00:33:51,884
- What do you want?
- I'm sorry about the other day.

305
00:34:00,555 --> 00:34:01,891
So, were you nice to him?

306
00:34:01,991 --> 00:34:05,859
Yeah. How can anyone
be friends with a Jap?

307
00:34:07,296 --> 00:34:10,664
Take him a gift, as a peace offering.

308
00:34:19,808 --> 00:34:21,675
Hey, Jap.

309
00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:27,262
Want a soda?

310
00:35:14,831 --> 00:35:17,800
And all he did was
throw it in the trash.

311
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,104
Oh, I think you'll be okay.

312
00:35:23,973 --> 00:35:26,843
- Hang out with him.
- Hang out?

313
00:35:26,943 --> 00:35:30,010
Yep. Just get to know him.

314
00:35:34,983 --> 00:35:38,489
Ollie, why are you getting me
involved in this?

315
00:35:38,589 --> 00:35:41,875
I just don't see how this helps anyone.

316
00:35:43,925 --> 00:35:46,402
Yes, yes, he did,

317
00:35:46,502 --> 00:35:50,442
but I don't even drink soda.

318
00:35:50,867 --> 00:35:55,101
Jeez. Just tell the kid to stop.

319
00:35:55,337 --> 00:35:57,125
Oh, no, he's back again.

320
00:36:01,176 --> 00:36:02,679
Hey!

321
00:36:03,379 --> 00:36:05,401
What are you doing
monkeying around my house?

322
00:36:05,701 --> 00:36:07,383
I want to hang out.

323
00:36:07,783 --> 00:36:09,952
Go hang out somewhere else.

324
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:13,039
I meant with you.

325
00:36:27,569 --> 00:36:30,498
Okay. Let's "hang out."

326
00:36:36,344 --> 00:36:39,712
Come on, get in, "Little Boy."

327
00:36:41,316 --> 00:36:44,088
Bad nicknames travel fast in this town.

328
00:36:44,188 --> 00:36:48,248
My family knows where I am.
Especially London.

329
00:37:02,212 --> 00:37:04,305
Okay, let's hang out.

330
00:37:13,582 --> 00:37:16,035
Go ahead, I'll meet you inside.

331
00:37:16,135 --> 00:37:18,151
No, no.

332
00:37:19,109 --> 00:37:20,988
Okay.

333
00:37:25,727 --> 00:37:27,737
What's he doing here?

334
00:37:32,034 --> 00:37:33,832
Come.

335
00:37:47,115 --> 00:37:48,384
What can I get you?

336
00:37:48,484 --> 00:37:52,852
- I'll have a chocolate sundae with...
- Hey, I ain't talking to you, Nip.

337
00:37:58,593 --> 00:38:00,835
What do you want, Little Boy?

338
00:38:01,596 --> 00:38:03,364
Two scoops of vanilla.

339
00:38:12,307 --> 00:38:15,309
I haven't had ice cream in years.

340
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:20,282
Why are you eating my ice cream?

341
00:38:20,382 --> 00:38:22,819
You can get ice cream anytime.

342
00:38:23,219 --> 00:38:25,607
Next time, try chocolate.

343
00:38:29,991 --> 00:38:32,995
Now are we finished hanging out?

344
00:38:33,095 --> 00:38:35,465
Then can I scratch you from my list?

345
00:38:36,578 --> 00:38:40,801
- What list?
- Father Oliver's "ancient list."

346
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:45,172
No, Ollie.

347
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:50,891
You told the boy that if he waves
a magic wand, he can bring his father back.

348
00:38:50,991 --> 00:38:53,060
- You don't believe that, do you?
- Maybe.

349
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:56,349
Maybe not.

350
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:02,184
If it's God's will, yes.

351
00:39:02,284 --> 00:39:06,162
He can do anything. He could turn you
into a rabbit if He wanted to.

352
00:39:06,262 --> 00:39:09,430
Have faith, Hashimoto.
You should try it.

353
00:39:11,409 --> 00:39:13,736
Not again.

354
00:39:13,836 --> 00:39:16,339
I do have faith.

355
00:39:16,439 --> 00:39:20,541
Faith in oneself.
Not in your imaginary friend in the sky.

356
00:39:24,045 --> 00:39:28,849
Let's hope this little game of yours
doesn't mess with the boy's mind.

357
00:39:31,586 --> 00:39:35,291
Two weeks? But what about the list?

358
00:39:35,391 --> 00:39:39,161
- I already finished with the Jap.
- Really?

359
00:39:39,261 --> 00:39:41,295
We're friends now.

360
00:39:42,964 --> 00:39:48,085
You continue with Mr. Hashimoto till
I can't see the hate in your eyes anymore.

361
00:39:50,071 --> 00:39:54,177
Go and visit a prisoner.
You already know one.

362
00:39:58,981 --> 00:40:01,617
I'll help you with the list
when I get back.

363
00:40:01,717 --> 00:40:03,666
I promise.

364
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:26,208
Befriend that rat
in order to get dad back?

365
00:40:26,308 --> 00:40:29,211
By doing this stupid list?

366
00:40:29,311 --> 00:40:33,647
By befriending him,
all you're doing is betraying Dad.

367
00:40:46,387 --> 00:40:47,563
Hey!

368
00:40:47,663 --> 00:40:49,697
Where do you think
you're going, Little Boy?

369
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,485
Come on.

370
00:41:13,722 --> 00:41:15,974
Jap lover!

371
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:25,985
You can drop me off here.

372
00:42:48,916 --> 00:42:52,194
I don't have anyone
to help me with my list.

373
00:43:04,357 --> 00:43:06,067
Okay.

374
00:43:06,167 --> 00:43:10,965
First things first...
my name is not "Jap."

375
00:43:15,243 --> 00:43:16,859
It's Hashimoto.

376
00:43:28,323 --> 00:43:31,282
All right, come in.

377
00:43:55,416 --> 00:43:59,543
Okay, come. Show me what you got.

378
00:44:05,639 --> 00:44:07,897
Where do we start?

379
00:44:08,597 --> 00:44:11,166
"Visit those in prison."

380
00:44:11,686 --> 00:44:14,182
Why is this crossed out?

381
00:44:15,370 --> 00:44:17,239
My brother.

382
00:44:17,539 --> 00:44:20,170
At least that schmuck
was good for something.

383
00:44:20,270 --> 00:44:22,311
"Visit the sick."

384
00:44:22,711 --> 00:44:24,914
I can help you with that one.

385
00:44:25,719 --> 00:44:29,582
Okay, just wait for me over here.

386
00:44:32,553 --> 00:44:34,857
I'm here for my monthly check-up.

387
00:44:35,423 --> 00:44:37,635
Who's your friend?

388
00:44:41,462 --> 00:44:43,552
He's not my friend.

389
00:44:43,652 --> 00:44:45,528
Thank you.

390
00:44:47,769 --> 00:44:50,172
Pepper. Come on.

391
00:44:51,125 --> 00:44:53,440
He's "not his friend."

392
00:45:15,996 --> 00:45:17,728
Hi.

393
00:45:21,486 --> 00:45:23,093
I was just visiting.

394
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:41,369
You can keep it.

395
00:45:43,591 --> 00:45:45,642
Thanks, kid.

396
00:45:49,397 --> 00:45:51,956
"Shelter the homeless."

397
00:45:52,601 --> 00:45:55,803
Is that one-eared oaf
still working at the shop?

398
00:45:55,903 --> 00:45:57,873
Teacup?

399
00:45:58,729 --> 00:46:00,908
<i>Yeah, he sleeps there.</i>

400
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:05,422
Not quite a home, right?

401
00:46:06,022 --> 00:46:09,449
What about London's vacant bed?

402
00:46:15,089 --> 00:46:17,630
Hey, they fit.

403
00:46:17,730 --> 00:46:20,095
I've never worn one of these before.

404
00:46:21,210 --> 00:46:23,144
It feels...

405
00:46:23,244 --> 00:46:25,062
nice.

406
00:46:25,162 --> 00:46:28,000
Then I guess you can keep 'em, Teacup.

407
00:46:40,381 --> 00:46:42,676
The next one...

408
00:46:43,085 --> 00:46:45,799
"Clothe the naked."

409
00:46:49,438 --> 00:46:50,626
"Spider ladies."

410
00:46:51,246 --> 00:46:54,061
They "knit and bite" all day.

411
00:47:00,601 --> 00:47:02,704
Shouldn't you be somewhere,

412
00:47:02,804 --> 00:47:07,143
playing with sticks or something,
with your friends?

413
00:47:08,214 --> 00:47:10,820
He has no friends.

414
00:47:20,154 --> 00:47:22,639
You put these two...

415
00:47:33,201 --> 00:47:36,703
- I think the baby's gonna like it.
- Thank you.

416
00:47:39,707 --> 00:47:41,911
<i>With Hashimoto's help,</i>

417
00:47:42,511 --> 00:47:45,382
<i>I'd finished the list in no time.</i>

418
00:47:46,114 --> 00:47:49,649
<i>And maybe he wasn't so bad after all.</i>

419
00:47:51,419 --> 00:47:53,956
<i>Things were looking up.</i>

420
00:47:54,156 --> 00:47:56,465
Good afternoon, Mrs. Busbee.

421
00:47:57,526 --> 00:48:01,030
I took the liberty of stopping by
today because I...

422
00:48:01,130 --> 00:48:04,199
I heard about your husband and...

423
00:48:04,299 --> 00:48:06,534
get your hat off.

424
00:48:07,136 --> 00:48:11,110
Mrs. Busbee, I want you
to know if you need anything,

425
00:48:11,210 --> 00:48:12,742
you can count on me.

426
00:48:14,509 --> 00:48:16,545
Thank you, Dr. Fox.

427
00:48:16,945 --> 00:48:18,714
Yeah.

428
00:48:19,314 --> 00:48:22,242
Boy, it smells good in here.

429
00:48:22,342 --> 00:48:25,904
Is that a casserole I smell?

430
00:48:26,504 --> 00:48:29,456
- It is.
- Yeah, I thought I could...

431
00:48:32,259 --> 00:48:34,294
Would you like to join us?

432
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:38,498
Yeah.

433
00:48:40,968 --> 00:48:43,338
Seems Dr. Fox always gets what he wants.

434
00:48:44,382 --> 00:48:45,907
Dr. Fox?

435
00:48:46,007 --> 00:48:48,360
This is great. Thank you so much.

436
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:50,426
Here we go.

437
00:48:58,886 --> 00:49:03,807
Emma... Freddy and I
haven't eaten like this since...

438
00:49:05,446 --> 00:49:07,827
well, Clarice passed.

439
00:49:23,245 --> 00:49:27,316
- Thank you for getting me out of jail.
- No trouble at all, son.

440
00:49:28,116 --> 00:49:30,652
I would do anything for your mother.

441
00:49:30,752 --> 00:49:33,410
That's my dad's seat, you know.

442
00:49:36,574 --> 00:49:38,360
I can see why.

443
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:40,527
Best view in the house.

444
00:49:43,697 --> 00:49:47,748
- May I be excused?
- Yes, you may.

445
00:50:13,461 --> 00:50:15,191
Hey!

446
00:50:15,691 --> 00:50:17,294
What are you doing...

447
00:50:17,394 --> 00:50:20,836
I heard about your stupid "magic list."

448
00:50:21,639 --> 00:50:25,402
And if you want it back,
you're gonna have to get it from me.

449
00:50:47,595 --> 00:50:51,722
But that was the list...
the ancient list. I need that one.

450
00:50:51,822 --> 00:50:54,369
If you need it so bad,
take it back from him.

451
00:50:54,469 --> 00:50:57,206
How? He's bigger than me.

452
00:50:57,954 --> 00:51:00,692
Everybody's bigger than me.

453
00:51:07,214 --> 00:51:08,884
Okay, stand up.

454
00:51:09,284 --> 00:51:12,079
Let's see how small you are.

455
00:51:14,687 --> 00:51:16,425
Right.

456
00:51:16,525 --> 00:51:19,295
You're a very small boy, indeed.

457
00:51:19,795 --> 00:51:24,201
Toothpick arms, cricket legs...

458
00:51:24,301 --> 00:51:26,633
size of Masao Kume.

459
00:51:31,472 --> 00:51:34,250
- Who's Masao...
- Kume.

460
00:51:34,350 --> 00:51:36,876
- Samurai.
- What's that?

461
00:51:39,046 --> 00:51:41,994
You don't know what a samurai is?

462
00:51:44,985 --> 00:51:47,493
These are samurai...

463
00:51:47,593 --> 00:51:49,858
Japanese warriors.

464
00:51:49,958 --> 00:51:52,794
What one's Masao... Kume?

465
00:51:54,483 --> 00:51:56,148
This is Masao Kume.

466
00:51:56,248 --> 00:52:00,085
- He doesn't look like a warrior.
- He wasn't.

467
00:52:00,685 --> 00:52:02,451
Not yet.

468
00:52:12,412 --> 00:52:14,790
<i>Masao Kume was small.</i>

469
00:52:15,750 --> 00:52:17,766
<i>Powerless.</i>

470
00:52:18,253 --> 00:52:20,987
<i>Nothing but a servant.</i>

471
00:52:23,157 --> 00:52:26,161
But in every man's life,

472
00:52:26,261 --> 00:52:28,610
there comes a day of truth.

473
00:52:28,710 --> 00:52:34,957
And that day came
when the Mongols invaded Japan.

474
00:52:35,057 --> 00:52:37,286
Who are the Mongols?

475
00:52:37,386 --> 00:52:39,425
They were bullies.

476
00:52:42,022 --> 00:52:44,776
<i>Samurai tried to defend their land,</i>

477
00:52:44,976 --> 00:52:49,813
<i>but Mongols had "Bukha the Immense."</i>

478
00:53:27,525 --> 00:53:30,472
<i>The Mongols issued a challenge.</i>

479
00:53:30,572 --> 00:53:34,676
<i>If anyone could defeat Bukha in battle,</i>

480
00:53:34,776 --> 00:53:37,877
<i>they would leave Japan, never to return.</i>

481
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:13,874
<i>Masao Kume believed
that nothing was more powerful...</i>

482
00:54:13,974 --> 00:54:15,748
<i>than the will.</i>

483
00:54:51,318 --> 00:54:54,387
The will to face one's fear...

484
00:54:55,990 --> 00:54:58,464
and to act.

485
00:55:05,766 --> 00:55:07,594
Stand.

486
00:55:09,303 --> 00:55:12,574
Now don't measure yourself
from here to the floor.

487
00:55:12,794 --> 00:55:16,462
Measure yourself from here to the sky.

488
00:55:18,532 --> 00:55:21,234
That makes you the tallest boy in town.

489
00:56:02,542 --> 00:56:06,744
Hey, Freddy. Look.
Someone's giving you the stink eye.

490
00:56:08,816 --> 00:56:10,802
Looking for something...

491
00:56:10,902 --> 00:56:12,737
Little Boy?

492
00:56:12,837 --> 00:56:16,558
Maybe this. It's a magic list, right?

493
00:56:16,658 --> 00:56:18,690
Give it back.

494
00:56:21,128 --> 00:56:22,995
Please?

495
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:37,643
You fat motherless pig!

496
00:56:44,517 --> 00:56:47,872
- Freddy, Freddy, Freddy, Freddy!
- This'll teach you to never mess with me.

497
00:56:48,272 --> 00:56:51,140
Freddy, Freddy, Freddy...

498
00:57:04,671 --> 00:57:07,122
I'm finishing you this time.

499
00:57:33,675 --> 00:57:35,871
"Invite a friend over."

500
00:57:36,671 --> 00:57:39,872
Feed the hungry also means
inviting a friend to eat.

501
00:57:58,510 --> 00:58:01,140
...whacked him so hard.

502
00:58:04,699 --> 00:58:06,642
I'll get it.

503
00:58:11,605 --> 00:58:14,246
Good day, Mrs. Busbee. I...

504
00:58:16,510 --> 00:58:20,048
I seem to have made a mistake.

505
00:58:21,110 --> 00:58:23,583
- Would you wait there a moment?
- Yes.

506
00:58:28,021 --> 00:58:31,423
I said for you to invite a friend.

507
00:58:32,558 --> 00:58:34,693
He is my friend.

508
00:58:41,468 --> 00:58:44,806
There's been no mistake.
Please come in, Mr. Hashimoto.

509
00:58:44,906 --> 00:58:47,439
Thank you, Mrs. Busbee.

510
00:58:56,115 --> 00:58:59,422
Do you have hot dogs
in Japan, Mr. Hashimoto?

511
00:59:00,483 --> 00:59:02,821
No, Mrs. Busbee.

512
00:59:07,927 --> 00:59:11,197
It's been 42 years
since I've been in Japan.

513
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:15,652
Seems like a lifetime ago.

514
00:59:17,271 --> 00:59:19,273
And do you still have
relatives over there?

515
00:59:19,373 --> 00:59:22,424
All I have left
of all my relatives is a...

516
00:59:22,524 --> 00:59:25,200
photo of my two nephews...

517
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:27,755
Takeshi and Koji.

518
00:59:32,252 --> 00:59:34,956
They probably live in my hometown still.

519
00:59:36,256 --> 00:59:38,757
Haven't heard from them since...

520
00:59:40,521 --> 00:59:42,873
The war changed everything.

521
00:59:45,232 --> 00:59:47,302
Yes, it has.

522
00:59:47,928 --> 00:59:49,423
For everyone.

523
00:59:52,472 --> 00:59:55,076
And did they send you away to the camps?

524
00:59:55,176 --> 01:00:00,479
- That is not the kind of question you ask.
- No, Mrs. Busbee, it's okay.

525
01:00:02,950 --> 01:00:05,086
It's simple.

526
01:00:05,386 --> 01:00:08,083
I have the face of the enemy.

527
01:00:08,756 --> 01:00:11,692
Doesn't matter if this is my home.

528
01:00:11,792 --> 01:00:14,496
Doesn't matter if I love
this land, this country...

529
01:00:14,596 --> 01:00:19,098
Mom, where's that other set of keys?
That lamebrain Teacup forgot...

530
01:00:37,284 --> 01:00:41,353
- Maybe we should...
- Yes, I'll help you clean up.

531
01:00:41,922 --> 01:00:43,728
Thank you.

532
01:00:49,763 --> 01:00:51,660
Sorry.

533
01:01:04,811 --> 01:01:05,922
London?

534
01:01:06,881 --> 01:01:09,017
London, what are you doing?
Put that down right now.

535
01:01:09,117 --> 01:01:11,853
London, put it down right now. Please?

536
01:01:11,953 --> 01:01:13,842
London, think about your dad.

537
01:01:13,942 --> 01:01:16,991
- Get out.
- London, think about what you're doing.

538
01:01:17,591 --> 01:01:20,659
Please stop. Stop.

539
01:01:21,061 --> 01:01:22,773
Mrs. Busbee.

540
01:01:24,922 --> 01:01:25,970
Pepper.

541
01:01:26,070 --> 01:01:30,247
Get out now.

542
01:01:30,605 --> 01:01:32,672
Or I'll shoot you where you stand.

543
01:01:36,476 --> 01:01:38,565
Get out!

544
01:01:48,822 --> 01:01:52,596
A Jap will not eat at my father's table.

545
01:01:53,060 --> 01:01:54,829
This is all your fault!

546
01:01:54,929 --> 01:01:58,430
Dad had to go to war
because you couldn't!

547
01:02:00,767 --> 01:02:03,037
Listen to me. If I see you
hanging out with that rat,

548
01:02:03,137 --> 01:02:05,905
- I will smack you in front of everyone...
- Enough!

549
01:02:11,646 --> 01:02:13,899
- You need to stop this nonsense.
- Stop what?

550
01:02:13,999 --> 01:02:17,985
Stop an eight-year-old boy from thinking
that he can do something to help his dad?

551
01:02:18,085 --> 01:02:20,521
Tell me, London,
what is so wrong with that?

552
01:02:20,821 --> 01:02:22,574
Nothing.

553
01:02:22,674 --> 01:02:26,942
Except for when the day comes
to tell him the Japs killed his father.

554
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:31,357
Stop saying your dad is dead.

555
01:02:33,300 --> 01:02:36,440
- Mom, I'm just trying to be prepared.
- Oh, shut up.

556
01:02:49,616 --> 01:02:51,578
Look at that.

557
01:02:58,024 --> 01:03:00,229
You should go home now.

558
01:03:00,995 --> 01:03:03,097
Is this man bothering you?

559
01:03:03,197 --> 01:03:05,132
No.

560
01:03:05,232 --> 01:03:06,568
He's my friend.

561
01:03:06,668 --> 01:03:10,571
Look, I have no business here with you.
All due respect, I'm going my way.

562
01:03:10,671 --> 01:03:13,639
With all due respect,
you're not going anywhere just yet.

563
01:03:15,508 --> 01:03:17,812
Am I a joke to you?

564
01:03:17,862 --> 01:03:21,169
Listen to me, if I see you around my brother
again, I will put a bullet in your head.

565
01:03:21,219 --> 01:03:23,213
- Do you understand me?
- That won't be needed.

566
01:03:23,313 --> 01:03:25,920
I think "Mr. Buddha-head"
here understands.

567
01:03:26,020 --> 01:03:29,788
You got one week to pack your crap
and get your yellow hide out of here.

568
01:03:31,691 --> 01:03:35,063
What, you don't believe me?
You stay and find out.

569
01:03:35,163 --> 01:03:36,840
Hey!

570
01:03:36,940 --> 01:03:40,168
You want to do something for Dad,
then you stop palling around with this rat.

571
01:03:40,268 --> 01:03:42,687
Stupid priest filling your head
with a bunch of fairy tales.

572
01:03:42,787 --> 01:03:46,391
What if I can?
What if I can bring Dad back?

573
01:03:47,441 --> 01:03:49,276
Dad back?

574
01:03:49,376 --> 01:03:52,580
How? How are you gonna
bring Dad back, you idiot?

575
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:55,817
Like... like, with the mustard seed.

576
01:03:56,917 --> 01:03:58,938
You can "move a mountain."

577
01:04:13,099 --> 01:04:14,750
Fine.

578
01:04:18,538 --> 01:04:20,708
You want to move a mountain?
There's one. Go ahead.

579
01:04:20,808 --> 01:04:24,036
Move it. Move it!

580
01:04:26,313 --> 01:04:28,502
Move it for everyone!

581
01:04:28,602 --> 01:04:32,987
You don't have to do it.
He's just trying to humiliate you.

582
01:04:34,156 --> 01:04:36,630
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

583
01:04:36,730 --> 01:04:39,026
Not now. No.

584
01:04:39,126 --> 01:04:40,614
Calm down.

585
01:05:10,098 --> 01:05:11,376
That's it.

586
01:06:37,777 --> 01:06:39,780
Do you know when Father Oliver's
coming back?

587
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:41,449
That's the little boy.

588
01:06:41,549 --> 01:06:44,767
This was much more
than just an earthquake.

589
01:06:44,867 --> 01:06:48,128
- What was it?
- It's a miracle.

590
01:06:50,524 --> 01:06:52,093
Let people believe what they want.

591
01:06:52,193 --> 01:06:56,264
They need crap like this to believe
that there's something bigger than them.

592
01:06:56,564 --> 01:07:00,332
Truth is, that earthquake would've happened
whether that boy was there or not.

593
01:07:02,336 --> 01:07:06,283
I've been walking to work for 35 years
and I'm telling you,

594
01:07:06,383 --> 01:07:09,844
that mountain was definitely...

595
01:07:10,344 --> 01:07:13,547
more to the right. Right?

596
01:07:14,081 --> 01:07:15,083
Father Oliver?

597
01:07:15,183 --> 01:07:17,685
What? What?
Yes, I heard about it on the...

598
01:07:17,785 --> 01:07:21,287
- No, a boy moved a mountain.
- He moved a what?

599
01:07:51,351 --> 01:07:53,589
I figured it out!

600
01:07:54,388 --> 01:07:55,751
Hashimoto!

601
01:08:00,426 --> 01:08:04,765
Japan is practically straight
in front of us.

602
01:08:05,365 --> 01:08:08,269
Now if you point to where the sun
touches the sea,

603
01:08:08,869 --> 01:08:12,487
you'd be pointing directly at Japan.

604
01:08:16,909 --> 01:08:19,313
- Why the sudden interest?
- I need to end the war.

605
01:08:19,413 --> 01:08:22,590
My dad can't come back until it's over.

606
01:08:23,917 --> 01:08:26,420
You mean doing this?

607
01:08:26,932 --> 01:08:28,189
Yes.

608
01:08:29,183 --> 01:08:32,075
All right, maybe it's time
I'm honest with you.

609
01:08:32,175 --> 01:08:34,161
I don't believe that you moved
any mountain

610
01:08:34,261 --> 01:08:36,464
or you had anything to do
with the earthquake.

611
01:08:36,564 --> 01:08:39,400
You were there. How could you say that?

612
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:44,036
I just don't believe that anyone
in the world could do such a thing.

613
01:08:48,140 --> 01:08:50,975
Then are you saying I should stop?

614
01:08:53,747 --> 01:08:58,717
I would say do what makes sense for you.

615
01:09:13,032 --> 01:09:15,336
It's just a loan, for goodness' sake.

616
01:09:15,436 --> 01:09:18,586
A loan from that Fox has enough strings
to start a puppet factory.

617
01:09:18,686 --> 01:09:21,244
And what do you suggest, then?
Lose your father's shop?

618
01:09:23,644 --> 01:09:26,280
We can pay him back
when your dad gets home.

619
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:30,815
I think Dr. Fox is counting
on Dad never coming home.

620
01:09:32,118 --> 01:09:34,887
And his loan required you
to get all dolled up?

621
01:09:41,127 --> 01:09:44,596
Today is me and your dad's
wedding anniversary.

622
01:09:56,175 --> 01:09:58,181
I'm sorry.

623
01:10:26,863 --> 01:10:29,441
What's Little Boy doing?

624
01:10:32,246 --> 01:10:35,751
I do believe men
can move mountains, Ollie.

625
01:10:35,851 --> 01:10:37,948
With dynamite.

626
01:10:39,419 --> 01:10:44,303
I believe that what happened to the mountain
can't be reduced to a game of chance.

627
01:10:45,859 --> 01:10:47,893
Much of life is a gamble, Ollie.

628
01:10:50,864 --> 01:10:53,500
You're advising a desperate child

629
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:57,137
who's ready to believe anything
that he is told.

630
01:10:57,237 --> 01:10:59,273
So tell me, Ollie...

631
01:10:59,373 --> 01:11:05,079
what happens when your imaginary friend
works in His mysterious ways...

632
01:11:05,779 --> 01:11:08,244
and his father dies?

633
01:11:09,082 --> 01:11:13,621
Then my "imaginary friend"
will also help him through it.

634
01:11:14,967 --> 01:11:17,324
Tell the kid to stop.

635
01:11:17,424 --> 01:11:20,892
If he doesn't,
could lose faith in himself.

636
01:11:22,061 --> 01:11:23,929
That's what you should be
worrying about.

637
01:12:47,547 --> 01:12:50,548
- Said it in the papers.
- Little Boy.

638
01:12:51,851 --> 01:12:54,183
That's Little Boy!

639
01:12:57,456 --> 01:12:59,244
There he is!

640
01:12:59,344 --> 01:13:00,978
Little Boy's here.

641
01:13:01,328 --> 01:13:03,631
- You did it!
- You did it, son.

642
01:13:05,566 --> 01:13:07,602
Go on, go on, read it to him.

643
01:13:07,702 --> 01:13:09,638
Give me that.

644
01:13:09,738 --> 01:13:12,042
Listen to this, Little Boy.

645
01:13:12,142 --> 01:13:15,376
"The greatest power known to man
has been unleashed.

646
01:13:15,776 --> 01:13:18,412
Yesterday at 5:15 our time,

647
01:13:18,512 --> 01:13:22,433
Hiroshima was destroyed
by the force of the atomic bomb,

648
01:13:22,533 --> 01:13:24,383
codename..."

649
01:13:26,718 --> 01:13:28,199
"Little Boy."

650
01:13:33,091 --> 01:13:35,379
- You did it.
- You did it.

651
01:13:35,479 --> 01:13:37,352
You did it.

652
01:13:42,169 --> 01:13:44,238
I did it!

653
01:13:44,338 --> 01:13:46,971
My dad is coming home!

654
01:13:53,835 --> 01:13:55,713
I did it!

655
01:13:58,952 --> 01:14:02,653
- You did it, Little Boy.
- My dad is coming home.

656
01:14:07,761 --> 01:14:09,563
I did it!

657
01:14:09,663 --> 01:14:12,325
My dad is coming home!

658
01:14:43,829 --> 01:14:46,545
Did they say when Dad's coming back?

659
01:14:53,839 --> 01:14:56,643
I wish things were that simple.

660
01:14:58,745 --> 01:15:01,515
Colonel Bob said that...

661
01:15:02,115 --> 01:15:05,452
the bomb may not be good
for American prisoners.

662
01:15:07,069 --> 01:15:08,556
What do you mean?

663
01:15:08,656 --> 01:15:13,691
It means that the Japanese may try to harm
your dad in revenge for the bomb.

664
01:15:15,361 --> 01:15:18,290
It wiped out an entire city.

665
01:16:58,230 --> 01:17:00,739
Hello, Hashimoto.

666
01:17:03,803 --> 01:17:05,891
I warned you.

667
01:17:05,991 --> 01:17:08,402
But you dared stay.

668
01:17:10,343 --> 01:17:12,729
And looking on the bright side,

669
01:17:13,129 --> 01:17:14,959
I...

670
01:17:15,059 --> 01:17:17,542
ended up doing you a favor.

671
01:17:18,385 --> 01:17:23,077
It's imprudent... to keep all these
traitorous Japanese souvenirs.

672
01:17:25,025 --> 01:17:29,565
Since we are at war against Japan.

673
01:17:30,329 --> 01:17:35,033
It was evil rats just like you
who cowardly murdered my son.

674
01:17:43,709 --> 01:17:46,744
The yellow fella
don't take a hint, does he?

675
01:17:54,353 --> 01:17:56,591
Doing this...

676
01:17:58,091 --> 01:18:01,192
won't bring back your son.

677
01:18:16,442 --> 01:18:17,800
Sam.

678
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:20,372
Sam, that's enough, Sam!

679
01:18:26,883 --> 01:18:29,004
Let's get outta here.

680
01:18:29,265 --> 01:18:30,737
Now!

681
01:18:34,186 --> 01:18:35,963
Sam.

682
01:18:36,463 --> 01:18:39,166
Sam, we can't... we can't just
leave him in there. He's gonna die.

683
01:18:39,266 --> 01:18:42,736
If we're caught here and he dies,
we rot in jail. Do you understand me?

684
01:18:43,552 --> 01:18:47,261
Get in the truck. Get in the truck now!

685
01:18:53,712 --> 01:18:57,851
Okay, you wanna play the hero?
That's your choice.

686
01:18:58,251 --> 01:19:02,586
But you better be man enough
to face the consequences on your own.

687
01:19:36,773 --> 01:19:38,338
How is he?

688
01:19:41,126 --> 01:19:45,931
- His heart is very weak.
- But he's gonna be okay, right?

689
01:19:51,236 --> 01:19:53,302
I don't know.

690
01:20:38,388 --> 01:20:40,234
<i>You have to let one die.</i>

691
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:43,697
<i>Make your choice.</i>

692
01:20:58,404 --> 01:21:00,615
Hashimoto.

693
01:21:00,715 --> 01:21:02,910
Hashimoto?

694
01:21:09,548 --> 01:21:11,471
Pepper.

695
01:21:20,092 --> 01:21:21,895
Nurse!

696
01:21:21,995 --> 01:21:24,965
- Get the doctor.
- Dr. Foley!

697
01:21:25,565 --> 01:21:27,751
- I need oxygen.
- Right away.

698
01:21:27,851 --> 01:21:32,253
Mr. Hashimoto, can you hear me?
Can you hear me?

699
01:21:38,777 --> 01:21:40,958
He's stopped breathing.

700
01:21:43,782 --> 01:21:45,792
Please don't die.

701
01:24:24,993 --> 01:24:26,288
You're free.

702
01:24:26,388 --> 01:24:29,865
The Jap dropped the charges.
Says you saved his life.

703
01:24:31,250 --> 01:24:33,420
Whatever that means.

704
01:24:34,120 --> 01:24:35,853
Ma'am.

705
01:25:56,268 --> 01:25:58,362
It's time.

706
01:26:04,276 --> 01:26:08,479
<i>We were told my father
was laid to rest in the Philippines.</i>

707
01:26:11,116 --> 01:26:14,288
<i>My mother still chose to have
a memorial for him back home.</i>

708
01:26:14,388 --> 01:26:18,058
Let us commit James L. Busbee's
body to the ground,

709
01:26:18,158 --> 01:26:21,411
earth to earth, ashes to ashes,

710
01:26:21,511 --> 01:26:23,713
dust to dust,

711
01:26:23,813 --> 01:26:26,660
in the sure and certain hope

712
01:26:27,500 --> 01:26:30,070
of the resurrection to eternal life.

713
01:26:31,434 --> 01:26:34,841
In the name of the Father and of the Son

714
01:26:34,941 --> 01:26:36,618
and of the Holy Spirit.

715
01:26:36,718 --> 01:26:38,615
Amen.

716
01:28:12,337 --> 01:28:14,836
You're my only partner.

717
01:28:56,548 --> 01:28:58,277
Do you mind if I sit here?

718
01:29:18,170 --> 01:29:19,906
You know, I...

719
01:29:20,006 --> 01:29:23,241
never got to say goodbye to my wife.

720
01:29:24,976 --> 01:29:27,914
By the time I got to the hospital,

721
01:29:28,014 --> 01:29:30,248
she was already in a coma.

722
01:29:35,954 --> 01:29:38,540
She died the next morning.

723
01:29:48,299 --> 01:29:52,441
I think it was stupid of me
to believe that a midget like me

724
01:29:52,541 --> 01:29:55,475
could bring my dad back
with some stupid list.

725
01:29:55,575 --> 01:29:57,277
It was not stupid.

726
01:29:57,877 --> 01:30:00,636
It takes courage to believe.

727
01:30:03,982 --> 01:30:06,884
Your father would be more
than proud of you.

728
01:30:09,805 --> 01:30:14,616
All the love you have for him
was contained in that list.

729
01:31:28,366 --> 01:31:30,713
I did this for you.

730
01:32:04,602 --> 01:32:07,540
39 inches. Same as before.

731
01:32:07,640 --> 01:32:09,521
I'm afraid I still don't have a...

732
01:32:09,621 --> 01:32:12,512
a diagnosis
for his irregular development,

733
01:32:12,612 --> 01:32:15,548
but I do have some theories.

734
01:32:15,648 --> 01:32:18,301
Maybe I could come over the house...

735
01:32:18,401 --> 01:32:21,236
later and we could discuss them.

736
01:32:22,034 --> 01:32:23,809
Perhaps tonight?

737
01:32:23,909 --> 01:32:26,893
I really appreciate the help
you've given us.

738
01:32:26,993 --> 01:32:28,878
I really do,

739
01:32:28,978 --> 01:32:31,164
but right now,

740
01:32:31,264 --> 01:32:33,533
my family needs some time alone.

741
01:32:34,233 --> 01:32:38,295
- Maybe after some time...
- You're a good man, Dr. Fox.

742
01:32:38,395 --> 01:32:42,455
But I will always be Mrs. James Busbee.

743
01:32:46,311 --> 01:32:48,112
Come on.

744
01:33:53,479 --> 01:33:56,149
- I need more bandages!
- What's the name on this one?

745
01:33:57,205 --> 01:33:59,086
I got him, I got him.

746
01:33:59,186 --> 01:34:01,453
Get that on his head!

747
01:34:01,553 --> 01:34:06,456
"James L. Busbee... 39627771."

748
01:34:31,349 --> 01:34:34,351
You did it, you little runt. You did it.

749
01:34:41,192 --> 01:34:42,123
London!

750
01:35:02,080 --> 01:35:07,451
<i>Father Oliver said God was responsible
for bringing my dad back.</i>

751
01:35:11,256 --> 01:35:15,294
<i>Hashimoto said it was
my father's will to live.</i>

752
01:35:15,994 --> 01:35:19,562
He survived an extremely severe trauma.

753
01:35:20,331 --> 01:35:22,153
<i>Me?</i>

754
01:35:24,302 --> 01:35:27,616
<i>Oh, I was holding on
to my mustard seed...</i>

755
01:35:29,257 --> 01:35:31,845
<i>because the journey was not over yet.</i>

756
01:35:48,426 --> 01:35:50,460
Partner?

757
01:35:53,665 --> 01:35:56,818
I got the boots you really wanted.

758
01:36:14,552 --> 01:36:16,949
It's me, partner.

759
01:36:47,902 --> 01:36:49,765
Partner.
