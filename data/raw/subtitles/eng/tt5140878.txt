2
00:02:27,326 --> 00:02:29,603
Find me

3
00:03:07,684 --> 00:03:09,269
closer

4
00:04:00,877 --> 00:04:02,547
found you!

5
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:06,747
Ah ha!

6
00:04:06,772 --> 00:04:08,397
You think you could hide
from me, did you?

7
00:04:08,398 --> 00:04:11,220
Did you read what it said?
It said found you.

8
00:04:11,221 --> 00:04:13,534
- It didn't say tickle...
- Samuel. Bee.

9
00:04:13,535 --> 00:04:15,276
That's enough.

10
00:04:19,044 --> 00:04:22,117
- You don't want to get overheated.
- I'm not.

11
00:04:22,118 --> 00:04:23,559
You're sure?

12
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,747
Good.
Because now it's my turn!

13
00:04:25,748 --> 00:04:27,710
- Dad, help!
- You need help?

14
00:04:27,711 --> 00:04:29,791
Oh sure, I can
help tickle you.

15
00:04:31,061 --> 00:04:34,146
I think the bottom of this feet
might be very ticklish.

16
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:49,149
Time for bed, Bee.

17
00:04:52,229 --> 00:04:53,730
Thank you.

18
00:05:00,943 --> 00:05:03,877
- Love you Mommy.
- Love you more.

19
00:05:09,211 --> 00:05:10,760
Mommy?

20
00:05:16,934 --> 00:05:20,074
- Just for a little while.
- Thanks.

21
00:05:49,404 --> 00:05:50,660
- Mommy.
- Um-hm.

22
00:05:50,661 --> 00:05:52,964
Can we play dollies
when we get home?

23
00:05:52,965 --> 00:05:56,130
Well, I think if you help me
with the washing up

24
00:05:56,131 --> 00:05:59,535
- I can play dollies with you all afternoon.
- Sam.

25
00:05:59,536 --> 00:06:00,443
Yes!

26
00:06:00,444 --> 00:06:01,676
Sam.

27
00:06:02,494 --> 00:06:03,546
Good morning, Sam.

28
00:06:03,547 --> 00:06:04,925
- Good morning, Esther.
- Morning.

29
00:06:04,926 --> 00:06:06,885
Hey there, busy Bee.

30
00:06:07,253 --> 00:06:08,847
Sam, just wondering...

31
00:06:08,872 --> 00:06:10,649
if you got that order
of mine ready yet?

32
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:13,079
I got customers coming
into my store everyday

33
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,792
asking about your dolls.

34
00:06:14,793 --> 00:06:17,209
You can send your son
over tomorrow, Vic.

35
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,375
They're ready.

36
00:06:18,376 --> 00:06:19,411
Well, hallelujah.

37
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:21,765
I guess prayers do
get answered, don't they?

38
00:06:21,766 --> 00:06:22,762
They do.

39
00:06:22,763 --> 00:06:25,252
Oh right... well, thank you so much.
You all have a good Sunday.

40
00:06:25,253 --> 00:06:27,597
- You have a good day too.
- You have a lovely day.

41
00:06:29,546 --> 00:06:31,036
In you get.

42
00:06:34,116 --> 00:06:35,605
Damn it!

43
00:06:35,867 --> 00:06:37,523
Language.

44
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:43,685
There's a car coming,
why don't I wave it down

45
00:06:43,686 --> 00:06:45,114
and see if we can
get some help.

46
00:06:45,115 --> 00:06:47,077
No, no, no, no.
I got it.

47
00:06:55,292 --> 00:06:56,733
I'll get it.

48
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,882
BEE!

49
00:07:02,883 --> 00:07:04,539
No!

B-L-U-E

54
00:07:51,213 --> 00:07:53,793
Okay.
Pick a number.

55
00:07:54,656 --> 00:07:56,148
Linda?

56
00:07:56,873 --> 00:07:58,539
Um.

57
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:00,624
Four.

58
00:08:00,649 --> 00:08:02,173
Okay.

59
00:08:02,944 --> 00:08:05,643
You will soon make new friends.

60
00:08:06,585 --> 00:08:08,285
Do my now.

61
00:08:11,149 --> 00:08:12,801
What's wrong?

62
00:08:14,084 --> 00:08:16,467
I just wish you and me
were going to a new home

63
00:08:16,468 --> 00:08:18,717
instead of a new orphanage.

64
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,528
Sweet Sue thinks too.

65
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:27,578
It would be nice
to have a home.

66
00:08:27,579 --> 00:08:30,177
Yeah, but...
only if you're there.

67
00:08:30,178 --> 00:08:32,782
I don't want to go
anywhere you're not.

68
00:08:34,736 --> 00:08:36,343
So, let's swear.

69
00:08:36,344 --> 00:08:39,807
If someone wants one of us,
they get both of us.

70
00:08:40,012 --> 00:08:42,813
Okay.
I swear.

71
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:44,139
Good.

72
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:46,083
Me too.

73
00:08:46,912 --> 00:08:49,603
You know what I like most
about Sweet Sue?

74
00:08:49,832 --> 00:08:51,222
What?

75
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:54,970
She looks just like you.

76
00:08:57,705 --> 00:09:00,147
So, how much further
is it, father?

77
00:09:00,368 --> 00:09:04,225
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
You're worse than the children, sister.

78
00:09:05,446 --> 00:09:09,300
The Mullins agreeing to take
us in was a gift from god.

79
00:09:09,301 --> 00:09:12,724
What kind of person isn't
excited about getting a gift?

80
00:09:12,923 --> 00:09:15,200
I should mention
don't be alarm if you...

81
00:09:15,201 --> 00:09:17,889
don't see much of
Mrs Mullins at first.

82
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,397
She... has a condition.

83
00:09:20,398 --> 00:09:24,850
You see, she was in
an accident years ago.

84
00:09:24,851 --> 00:09:28,056
You girls would do well
to help her if need be.

85
00:10:38,998 --> 00:10:42,093
Janice.
You need help?

86
00:10:42,094 --> 00:10:44,811
No, thanks.
I can manage.

87
00:10:50,148 --> 00:10:51,675
Sister.

88
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:56,248
She's one of the unfortunate ones
with that polio outbreak,

89
00:10:56,249 --> 00:10:59,045
but she's getting stronger everyday.

90
00:10:59,046 --> 00:11:01,826
She won't be a burden,
I promise you.

91
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:03,033
Um-hm.

92
00:11:03,034 --> 00:11:06,750
Mr Mullins, why don't
you show the girls around?

93
00:11:06,994 --> 00:11:09,507
I can unload their belongings.

94
00:11:10,052 --> 00:11:11,947
We'll start inside.

95
00:11:12,093 --> 00:11:13,929
Thank you, father.

96
00:11:22,736 --> 00:11:25,660
Wow.
This is an amazing castle.

97
00:11:25,661 --> 00:11:28,284
Which obviously makes us the princesses.

98
00:11:28,309 --> 00:11:29,742
This is our new orphanage?

99
00:11:29,767 --> 00:11:32,561
I think this is fine if
we're never being adopted.

100
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:36,526
There's a TV.

101
00:11:36,527 --> 00:11:40,897
The television no longer works,
the radio however does.

102
00:11:46,181 --> 00:11:48,747
This goes on forever.

103
00:11:48,748 --> 00:11:51,649
You're right. We're going to need
a map to find our way around.

104
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:53,955
Girls, this way.

105
00:11:55,409 --> 00:11:58,039
As you can see, the dining room
is more than adequate

106
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,303
to accommodate all of us.

107
00:12:02,901 --> 00:12:04,050
Wow.
Look here.

108
00:12:04,051 --> 00:12:05,965
Let's stay together.

109
00:12:13,362 --> 00:12:16,030
Mrs Mullins and I stay in here.

110
00:12:16,254 --> 00:12:19,803
Fell free to use the rest of the
downstairs as you see fit.

111
00:12:19,828 --> 00:12:22,137
Your rooms are upstairs.

112
00:12:22,571 --> 00:12:23,701
Mr Mullins.

113
00:12:23,702 --> 00:12:27,747
Is there someway Janice and I
can maybe stay down here?

114
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:29,422
Me too.

115
00:12:29,507 --> 00:12:31,156
I'll be fine.

116
00:12:45,512 --> 00:12:48,167
I installed it years ago
for my wife.

117
00:12:48,168 --> 00:12:52,270
Hasn't been used in ages,
but it works fine.

118
00:12:52,659 --> 00:12:54,456
Try it, Jan.

119
00:12:56,202 --> 00:12:58,369
If you don't, I will.

120
00:13:03,434 --> 00:13:04,874
Up is up

121
00:13:04,899 --> 00:13:06,580
Down is down.

122
00:13:06,581 --> 00:13:08,522
But it won't work...

123
00:13:09,929 --> 00:13:12,869
... unless you click the seat belt in.

124
00:13:13,532 --> 00:13:15,070
Like this.

125
00:13:17,023 --> 00:13:18,604
Simple.

126
00:13:29,785 --> 00:13:31,399
Thank you.

127
00:14:28,899 --> 00:14:30,998
I get to go next!

128
00:14:44,689 --> 00:14:46,676
Wow.
Nice.

129
00:14:46,701 --> 00:14:49,373
I guess this is ours.

130
00:14:50,878 --> 00:14:53,803
Let's take that side.

131
00:14:53,804 --> 00:14:56,028
Kate and Tierney can have these.

132
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:58,405
What about Linda and me?

133
00:14:58,711 --> 00:15:02,353
Relax, Janice. This is a big house,
there are other bedrooms.

134
00:15:02,378 --> 00:15:04,387
Why can't Linda and me
have those over there?

135
00:15:04,412 --> 00:15:08,237
Okay, but then,
where would Kate and Tierney sleep?

136
00:15:14,918 --> 00:15:16,494
Wow.

137
00:15:16,599 --> 00:15:18,082
This is neat.

138
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,618
I got this one.

139
00:15:46,623 --> 00:15:48,015
Locked.

140
00:15:48,354 --> 00:15:50,702
And it stays that way too.

141
00:15:59,434 --> 00:16:02,256
Hey, Jan.
In here.

142
00:16:30,108 --> 00:16:31,475
Hey.

143
00:16:32,545 --> 00:16:34,967
You wanna bunk beds?

144
00:17:51,909 --> 00:17:54,541
- Hey sister Charlotte, can we...
- Oh lord.

145
00:17:54,566 --> 00:17:59,064
Please bless Nancy with the wisdom
to not give people their heart attacks.

146
00:17:59,065 --> 00:18:00,430
Sorry.

147
00:18:00,461 --> 00:18:01,805
What is your emergency?

148
00:18:01,806 --> 00:18:03,090
Can we go exploring?

149
00:18:03,091 --> 00:18:05,102
Help father Massey with
your things first and then...

150
00:18:05,103 --> 00:18:06,710
But Mr Mullins insist that we go.

151
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:08,971
- But that doesn't mean you don't have to...
- You know how father Massey is.

152
00:18:08,972 --> 00:18:11,102
We'll only get in the way.

153
00:18:12,832 --> 00:18:15,148
- Fine.
- She said okay!

154
00:18:15,149 --> 00:18:17,356
But look out for one another.

155
00:18:21,846 --> 00:18:23,636
You coming, Jan?

156
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,695
Maybe in a little while.

157
00:18:27,376 --> 00:18:28,827
Well.

158
00:18:29,516 --> 00:18:31,375
Maybe I'll stay too.

159
00:18:31,572 --> 00:18:33,869
Because you feel sorry for me?

160
00:18:34,672 --> 00:18:35,856
Well...

161
00:18:35,857 --> 00:18:39,145
You promised you wouldn't
treat me any differently.

162
00:18:39,182 --> 00:18:40,663
Okay.

163
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,080
See ya!

164
00:20:22,858 --> 00:20:26,862
Dear lord.
Thank you for bringing us all together.

165
00:20:27,934 --> 00:20:30,501
Bless this food for our use,

166
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,235
and us to thy service.

167
00:20:34,204 --> 00:20:37,261
Fill our hearts with grateful praise.

168
00:20:37,637 --> 00:20:41,499
And help us give you
glory each day through

169
00:20:43,326 --> 00:20:46,112
Jesus Christ our Lord.
Amen.

170
00:20:46,113 --> 00:20:47,513
- Amen.
- Amen.

171
00:20:58,817 --> 00:21:00,856
If you'd excuse me.

172
00:21:35,818 --> 00:21:37,350
Carol.

173
00:21:43,309 --> 00:21:45,653
Keep to your own business.

174
00:21:57,453 --> 00:22:02,527
And if I die before I wake,
I pray the lord my soul to take.

175
00:22:02,528 --> 00:22:04,808
Please, god.
Help Linda and me find a good home

176
00:22:04,809 --> 00:22:06,252
and keeps us together.

177
00:22:06,253 --> 00:22:10,026
- So we finally be real sisters.
- With good loving parents.

178
00:22:10,027 --> 00:22:12,619
That hate homework
because we do.

179
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:16,880
But, even if they don't,
that's okay too.

180
00:22:17,216 --> 00:22:19,096
Amen.

181
00:23:06,926 --> 00:23:09,580
Find me

182
00:23:46,162 --> 00:23:47,754
in here

183
00:23:57,434 --> 00:23:59,013
Nancy.

184
00:24:00,045 --> 00:24:01,513
Carol.

185
00:24:02,187 --> 00:24:04,373
Are you guys in here?

186
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:13,089
Forgive me, Father,
for I am about to sin.

187
00:30:53,863 --> 00:30:57,333
I think this is where
Mr Mullins keeps his wife.

188
00:30:57,631 --> 00:30:59,211
Does she really wear a mask?

189
00:30:59,236 --> 00:31:01,674
Yeah, she looked like a doll.

190
00:31:02,676 --> 00:31:04,599
Mrs Mullins?

191
00:31:04,683 --> 00:31:06,055
You down there?

192
00:31:06,056 --> 00:31:07,381
Stop it.

193
00:31:08,045 --> 00:31:10,123
I think he seems nice.

194
00:31:10,278 --> 00:31:13,150
Why don't you go find Janice,
see what she's up to.

195
00:31:13,151 --> 00:31:14,269
Why?

196
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:16,116
So you can talk about boys.

197
00:31:16,117 --> 00:31:18,786
Well, do you want to
talk about boys?

198
00:31:18,998 --> 00:31:21,789
Gross.
No.

199
00:31:21,846 --> 00:31:23,222
I want to play a game.

200
00:31:23,223 --> 00:31:24,575
Okay.

201
00:31:24,576 --> 00:31:26,084
Let's play hide and seek.

202
00:31:26,085 --> 00:31:28,484
You go hide and
we'll come look for you.

203
00:31:28,485 --> 00:31:29,926
Okay.

204
00:31:35,122 --> 00:31:38,128
So, are we going to
look for her?

205
00:31:38,309 --> 00:31:39,890
Maybe.

206
00:31:45,798 --> 00:31:47,385
Bless you.

207
00:31:47,386 --> 00:31:48,823
Thank you.

208
00:31:49,474 --> 00:31:50,944
What are you doing?

209
00:31:50,945 --> 00:31:54,269
I asked Mr Mullins if we could use
this room for our new classroom

210
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:56,674
and he graciously agreed.

211
00:31:56,675 --> 00:31:58,543
Would you like to help?

212
00:32:00,646 --> 00:32:02,290
What's wrong?

213
00:32:03,582 --> 00:32:06,018
I have a sin to confess.

214
00:32:07,609 --> 00:32:10,544
Forgive me, sister Charlotte,
for I have sinned.

215
00:32:11,104 --> 00:32:14,142
-  It's been...
- At least 2 weeks.

216
00:32:15,151 --> 00:32:17,734
... at least 2 weeks
since my last confession.

217
00:32:19,873 --> 00:32:22,289
There's this room upstairs
I'm not suppose to go into.

218
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:24,105
But you did anyway.

219
00:32:25,079 --> 00:32:26,319
How did you know?

220
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,773
Because otherwise why would
you be telling me about it.

221
00:32:31,404 --> 00:32:34,215
Well, the door was already opened.

222
00:32:34,834 --> 00:32:38,482
I don't know how because
Mr Mullins always keeps it locked.

223
00:32:39,052 --> 00:32:41,291
When I went inside
there was this little doll.

224
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:43,597
- And it was really strange.
- Janice.

225
00:32:43,738 --> 00:32:45,368
Weird things started to happen.

226
00:32:45,369 --> 00:32:47,952
Janice, listen to yourself.

227
00:32:49,127 --> 00:32:51,587
What do I always say?

228
00:32:52,385 --> 00:32:55,791
A sin is a sin
no matter the context.

229
00:32:56,917 --> 00:33:01,437
More importantly, you absolutely
cannot disobey the Mullins.

230
00:33:02,748 --> 00:33:05,692
We only just got here and
they're doing a very generous thing

231
00:33:05,693 --> 00:33:08,195
by allowing us
to stay with them.

232
00:33:09,643 --> 00:33:12,503
If they decide to
no longer have us here...

233
00:33:12,504 --> 00:33:14,445
we'll all be split up.

234
00:33:14,787 --> 00:33:18,167
So next time you're thinking
of breaking a rule,

235
00:33:18,403 --> 00:33:22,874
think of how that could've affect
the other girls first.

236
00:33:24,871 --> 00:33:26,158
Do you understand me?

237
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:28,112
Yes.
I'm sorry, sister, I wasn't thinking.

238
00:33:28,113 --> 00:33:29,699
It's okay, love.

239
00:33:32,054 --> 00:33:35,182
For your penance,
pray 1 Hail Mary

240
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:38,675
and unpack 3 of these boxes.

241
00:33:43,441 --> 00:33:45,219
What are you guys doing?

242
00:33:45,996 --> 00:33:47,981
Unpacking boxes.

243
00:33:48,351 --> 00:33:49,639
Oh.

244
00:34:36,772 --> 00:34:38,888
This place is so creepy.

245
00:34:52,556 --> 00:34:54,069
What was that?

246
00:34:59,402 --> 00:35:01,118
What was that?

247
00:35:07,142 --> 00:35:09,419
How dare you!

248
00:35:12,674 --> 00:35:14,947
Oh, Mr Scarecrow.

249
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:27,195
Oh.

250
00:36:28,089 --> 00:36:29,646
Found you.

251
00:36:29,984 --> 00:36:32,287
You're not very good at hiding.

252
00:36:37,727 --> 00:36:41,059
Years of neglect have
affected the counter balance.

253
00:36:41,293 --> 00:36:43,904
There.
That should keep the draft out.

254
00:36:43,905 --> 00:36:45,455
Thank you.

255
00:36:54,338 --> 00:36:56,303
That was taken in Romania.

256
00:36:56,304 --> 00:36:58,621
At a convent of cloistered nuns.

257
00:36:58,622 --> 00:37:00,430
They have little contact
with the outside world

258
00:37:00,431 --> 00:37:03,303
but I became very close
to these three.

259
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:06,575
That's sister Maria.
That's sister Anna.

260
00:37:06,576 --> 00:37:08,709
And that's sister Lucia.

261
00:37:10,122 --> 00:37:11,903
Who's this?

262
00:37:12,289 --> 00:37:13,425
!! Valak !!

263
00:37:14,572 --> 00:37:17,597
I... don't know.
I don't think I even met her.

264
00:37:20,518 --> 00:37:22,242
Is there anything else you need?

265
00:37:22,267 --> 00:37:24,086
No.
Thank you.

266
00:37:28,049 --> 00:37:29,544
Good night.

267
00:37:31,897 --> 00:37:33,426
Good night.

268
00:37:36,527 --> 00:37:38,425
Uuu.
I like him.

269
00:37:38,565 --> 00:37:40,359
Which one would you marry?

270
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,051
Oh.
I don't know.

271
00:37:42,052 --> 00:37:45,161
I guess I'll just have to date
all of them to find out.

272
00:37:45,482 --> 00:37:47,482
How do you like his eyebrows?

273
00:37:48,033 --> 00:37:50,310
- His eye.
- Ain't he handsome?

274
00:38:15,031 --> 00:38:18,617
Night time is when Mrs Mullins
gets her powers.

275
00:38:18,618 --> 00:38:21,204
That's why she's in bed all day.
But at night...

276
00:38:21,205 --> 00:38:23,200
she can go wherever she wants.

277
00:38:23,201 --> 00:38:27,072
She needs to
so she can feed.

278
00:38:27,097 --> 00:38:29,666
And if you look directly
at her you'll die.

279
00:38:29,667 --> 00:38:31,808
And to get you to look,
she'll keep saying your name

280
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:36,659
over and over
till you can't stand it!

281
00:38:38,718 --> 00:38:41,945
Nancy.
Nancy.

282
00:38:41,946 --> 00:38:44,217
- Nancy...
- No. No.

283
00:38:44,242 --> 00:38:45,695
Nancy.

284
00:39:02,826 --> 00:39:04,062
No.

285
00:39:04,641 --> 00:39:06,559
She's ready to feed.

286
00:39:07,098 --> 00:39:09,967
Carol.
Carol.

287
00:39:09,968 --> 00:39:11,018
Carol.

288
00:39:11,019 --> 00:39:12,384
Hey, we're not suppose to be up.

289
00:39:12,385 --> 00:39:14,752
- Well, you'll do it to.
- Hey.

290
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:26,044
Why isn't he answering her?

291
00:39:56,838 --> 00:39:58,821
- It's her.
- Don't look at her.

292
00:39:59,022 --> 00:39:59,968
No!

293
00:39:59,969 --> 00:40:03,364
No.
Please please please...

294
00:40:03,682 --> 00:40:05,066
Please.

295
00:40:06,883 --> 00:40:08,088
Please.

296
00:40:16,419 --> 00:40:17,916
She's gone.

297
00:40:19,079 --> 00:40:21,726
She's gone.
She's gone.

298
00:40:24,353 --> 00:40:25,953
What's going on?

299
00:40:25,954 --> 00:40:27,124
What on god's earth?

300
00:40:27,149 --> 00:40:28,701
- Sister Charlotte.
- Mrs Mullins.

301
00:40:28,702 --> 00:40:29,784
She was here.
We heard.

302
00:40:29,785 --> 00:40:32,110
In this room,
she was standing right over there.

303
00:40:32,111 --> 00:40:33,449
Who?

304
00:40:34,398 --> 00:40:36,117
Your wife apparently.

305
00:40:36,118 --> 00:40:37,863
They said she was
just in here.

306
00:40:37,864 --> 00:40:39,497
Oh, that's impossible.

307
00:40:39,498 --> 00:40:42,815
My wife hasn't been
able to walk for years.

308
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:08,194
Girls.
Girls.

309
00:41:09,178 --> 00:41:11,859
Let's go back to our studies, okay?

310
00:41:25,035 --> 00:41:27,040
You okay, Nance?

311
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:40,622
Did you really see Mrs Mullins
in your room last night?

312
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:42,470
Yes.
We swear we were under the cover and...

313
00:41:42,471 --> 00:41:44,511
Nancy.
Stop it.

314
00:41:44,512 --> 00:41:47,661
We just freaked ourselves out
last night, you know that.

315
00:42:03,852 --> 00:42:05,541
Mrs Mullins?

316
00:42:06,003 --> 00:42:07,859
Sister Charlotte.

317
00:42:07,884 --> 00:42:10,934
Could I trouble you
for a glass of water?

318
00:42:10,959 --> 00:42:12,729
Of course.

319
00:42:48,105 --> 00:42:50,729
It's good to hear
some life again.

320
00:42:51,262 --> 00:42:56,053
I've been cooped up here so long
I forgotten what that sounded like.

321
00:42:58,018 --> 00:42:59,921
What a lovely picture.

322
00:42:59,922 --> 00:43:01,966
She was taken from us

323
00:43:01,967 --> 00:43:05,309
at an early age... unfortunately.

324
00:43:06,698 --> 00:43:09,413
If you could turn away
for a moment, sister.

325
00:43:09,414 --> 00:43:11,160
Yes, of course.

326
00:43:12,899 --> 00:43:16,173
I'm very sorry to hear
about your daughter.

327
00:43:18,347 --> 00:43:22,685
But we find comfort in knowing
she waits for you in heaven.

328
00:43:23,015 --> 00:43:25,438
I wish that were true.

329
00:45:17,457 --> 00:45:19,834
Oh my gosh.

330
00:45:20,859 --> 00:45:23,202
You shouldn't be in here.

331
00:45:23,244 --> 00:45:25,333
Well, neither should you.

332
00:45:36,306 --> 00:45:38,436
Who's room is this anyways?

333
00:45:38,437 --> 00:45:40,376
The Mullins had a daughter.

334
00:45:40,377 --> 00:45:42,132
It was her's.

335
00:45:44,314 --> 00:45:45,976
Had one?

336
00:45:46,497 --> 00:45:48,541
I think she died.

337
00:45:50,924 --> 00:45:53,832
And I think that was her
playing the music too.

338
00:45:59,075 --> 00:46:00,933
Stop trying to scare me.

339
00:46:00,934 --> 00:46:02,848
I'm not.
It's the truth.

340
00:46:02,849 --> 00:46:04,808
Then why are we in here?

341
00:46:04,809 --> 00:46:06,843
- We should leave.
- No.

342
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:08,673
Oh.

343
00:46:20,449 --> 00:46:21,912
Linda.

344
00:46:22,256 --> 00:46:23,743
What is it?

345
00:46:25,215 --> 00:46:27,312
We shouldn't be in here.

346
00:46:29,221 --> 00:46:30,605
Okay.

347
00:46:31,671 --> 00:46:33,443
I'll leave in a minute.

348
00:46:33,444 --> 00:46:35,201
Well, I'm going.

349
00:47:05,926 --> 00:47:09,434
Dear Diary, today I came home

350
00:47:44,145 --> 00:47:45,765
Who's doing that?

351
00:48:36,699 --> 00:48:38,197
Hi.

352
00:48:52,056 --> 00:48:55,443
You're the Mullins' daughter...
aren't you?

353
00:48:57,877 --> 00:49:00,150
What happened to you?

354
00:49:00,346 --> 00:49:02,340
Will you help me?

355
00:49:05,193 --> 00:49:07,071
What do you need?

356
00:49:10,481 --> 00:49:12,895
YOUR SOUL!

357
00:49:33,642 --> 00:49:35,385
Charlotte!

358
00:49:35,386 --> 00:49:37,716
Sister Charlotte!

359
00:50:48,901 --> 00:50:50,209
No.

360
00:52:52,265 --> 00:52:54,105
How do you feel?

361
00:52:55,154 --> 00:52:56,968
Give her some space.

362
00:53:01,154 --> 00:53:02,671
Girls.

363
00:53:03,658 --> 00:53:05,426
Janice is feeling
a little down right now.

364
00:53:05,427 --> 00:53:08,420
So, we need to do
what we can to support her.

365
00:53:08,868 --> 00:53:11,628
Time I think
is all she needs.

366
00:53:11,911 --> 00:53:15,052
She'll walk again, right?

367
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:17,671
We'll have to see.

368
00:53:19,381 --> 00:53:20,737
You need sleep.

369
00:53:20,738 --> 00:53:23,402
That's going to help you
with the healing.

370
00:53:23,701 --> 00:53:26,287
I can't stay here, sister Charlotte.

371
00:53:27,064 --> 00:53:28,907
We can't stay here.

372
00:53:28,908 --> 00:53:30,674
We need to leave.

373
00:53:30,689 --> 00:53:32,168
Leave?

374
00:53:32,193 --> 00:53:33,930
And go where?

375
00:53:36,491 --> 00:53:39,287
There isn't anywhere else
for us to go.

376
00:53:39,972 --> 00:53:42,910
I didn't fall down those stairs.

377
00:53:43,547 --> 00:53:45,626
Something threw me.

378
00:53:46,061 --> 00:53:48,037
What do you mean?

379
00:53:50,529 --> 00:53:52,459
You always say that

380
00:53:52,566 --> 00:53:55,467
even though we can't see god
we can...

381
00:53:55,468 --> 00:53:57,814
we can feel his presence.

382
00:53:58,377 --> 00:53:59,834
Well...

383
00:54:00,181 --> 00:54:04,229
in this house I feel
a different kind of presence.

384
00:54:04,334 --> 00:54:05,983
What kind?

385
00:54:09,954 --> 00:54:11,974
An evil one.

386
00:54:12,008 --> 00:54:14,021
It's coming after me.

387
00:54:14,022 --> 00:54:15,464
Coming after my soul.

388
00:54:15,465 --> 00:54:17,001
You soul?

389
00:54:17,002 --> 00:54:19,102
Because I'm the weakest.

390
00:54:19,103 --> 00:54:20,928
No, darling.

391
00:54:21,145 --> 00:54:22,542
Listen.

392
00:54:22,621 --> 00:54:25,360
The devil preys on
those weak in faith,

393
00:54:25,361 --> 00:54:27,943
not weak of flesh and bone.

394
00:54:28,039 --> 00:54:31,625
You are as strong
as any of us, Janice.

395
00:54:32,975 --> 00:54:34,653
Stronger.

396
00:54:51,196 --> 00:54:53,640
You're quiet, Samuel.

397
00:54:54,604 --> 00:54:56,925
I think it was a mistake...

398
00:54:57,523 --> 00:54:59,616
to bring the girls here.

399
00:55:00,926 --> 00:55:02,503
Why?

400
00:55:04,593 --> 00:55:06,380
The girl ...

401
00:55:06,832 --> 00:55:08,807
The girl that fell.

402
00:55:09,774 --> 00:55:11,842
Maybe she didn't fall.

403
00:55:12,375 --> 00:55:14,008
Maybe...

404
00:55:14,655 --> 00:55:16,594
It was an accident.

405
00:55:17,293 --> 00:55:19,161
That's all it was.

406
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:21,568
Accidents happen.

407
00:55:25,663 --> 00:55:28,995
It's been quiet for 12 years.

408
00:55:30,663 --> 00:55:34,343
You should try embracing
the presence of the girls...

409
00:55:34,793 --> 00:55:37,656
instead of frightening them away.

410
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:43,960
You'll be better soon.

411
00:55:43,961 --> 00:55:46,038
I don't think so.

412
00:55:47,862 --> 00:55:49,678
Not this time.

413
00:55:50,009 --> 00:55:51,946
But you have too.

414
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:55,819
You said we'll find
a new home.

415
00:55:56,738 --> 00:55:59,061
No one is going to
want me now.

416
00:55:59,062 --> 00:56:01,229
I'll just be a burden.

417
00:56:02,410 --> 00:56:05,031
But you swore we'll stick together.

418
00:56:05,478 --> 00:56:07,345
I take it back.

419
00:56:10,889 --> 00:56:13,475
Maybe I won't get adopted.

420
00:56:17,635 --> 00:56:19,306
You will.

421
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:21,079
You know why?

422
00:56:21,705 --> 00:56:23,791
Because you're special.

423
00:56:25,262 --> 00:56:30,138
You're going to get adopted by
a nice family somewhere

424
00:56:30,139 --> 00:56:32,904
and they're going to
spoil you so much.

425
00:56:33,381 --> 00:56:35,260
You're going to have
so many dolls that...

426
00:56:35,261 --> 00:56:37,594
you won't even be able to
name all of them.

427
00:56:37,595 --> 00:56:39,251
Sure I can.

428
00:56:39,252 --> 00:56:40,941
Janice one.

429
00:56:40,942 --> 00:56:43,522
Janice Two.
Janice Three.

430
00:56:44,964 --> 00:56:48,532
Linda.
Time for bed.

431
00:56:50,470 --> 00:56:53,091
Won't you come upstairs?

432
00:56:53,928 --> 00:56:56,158
I don't want to sleep alone.

433
00:56:57,990 --> 00:56:59,422
Here.

434
00:57:00,409 --> 00:57:02,176
Take Becca.

435
00:57:02,472 --> 00:57:04,179
This way,

436
00:57:04,797 --> 00:57:06,782
I'll always be with you.

437
00:57:09,954 --> 00:57:13,140
Then, you should have Sweet Sue.

438
00:57:14,954 --> 00:57:16,591
Thank you.

439
00:57:20,276 --> 00:57:23,061
Remember before
all of this.

440
00:57:23,281 --> 00:57:27,354
When we used to sneak around
the orphanage at night,

441
00:57:27,534 --> 00:57:30,276
And ate all the chocolate
in the pantry.

442
00:57:30,277 --> 00:57:34,217
Father Massey was convinced
that we had mice.

443
00:57:35,025 --> 00:57:39,784
Oh lord, please cleanse
my soul of my sins

444
00:57:39,785 --> 00:57:42,445
and cleanse our house of...

445
00:57:42,446 --> 00:57:44,846
- these mice.
- these mice.

446
00:57:51,299 --> 00:57:53,702
Whatever happens...

447
00:57:54,850 --> 00:57:58,615
I'm thinking always
all those things we did together.

448
00:58:01,271 --> 00:58:02,952
Good night, Linda.

449
00:58:03,339 --> 00:58:05,202
Good night, Janice.

450
01:03:04,648 --> 01:03:07,385
A little sunlight will
do you some good.

451
01:03:07,451 --> 01:03:10,599
I don't the sunlight can fix
what's wrong with me.

452
01:03:11,749 --> 01:03:14,203
You mustn't give up hope.

453
01:03:15,656 --> 01:03:18,179
Hope is a home onto itself.

454
01:03:18,180 --> 01:03:21,176
Dwell in it and it will
protect and keep you.

455
01:03:23,061 --> 01:03:25,382
What book of the bible
is that from?

456
01:03:27,460 --> 01:03:29,199
The book of Charlotte.

457
01:03:30,001 --> 01:03:32,638
But that doesn't
make it any less so.

458
01:03:34,128 --> 01:03:35,925
Are you okay here?

459
01:03:37,454 --> 01:03:39,633
The sunlight actually
feels kind of nice.

460
01:03:39,634 --> 01:03:41,386
I told you.

461
01:03:49,472 --> 01:03:50,973
That's too low.

462
01:04:18,937 --> 01:04:20,677
Sister Charlotte?

463
01:04:27,018 --> 01:04:28,737
No, no, no!

464
01:04:29,272 --> 01:04:31,675
No!
Please!

465
01:06:05,990 --> 01:06:07,457
Janice!

466
01:06:10,345 --> 01:06:11,772
Janice!

467
01:06:14,035 --> 01:06:15,729
What's going on?

468
01:06:18,303 --> 01:06:19,953
I couldn't get out.

469
01:06:19,954 --> 01:06:21,822
Are you okay?

470
01:06:25,402 --> 01:06:27,115
I'm fine.

471
01:06:33,850 --> 01:06:36,170
I'm worry about Janice.

472
01:06:36,774 --> 01:06:38,868
A few nights ago
she wanted to leave.

473
01:06:38,869 --> 01:06:40,389
Why she want to leave?

474
01:06:40,390 --> 01:06:43,337
Probably because this place
is off the wall.

475
01:06:43,404 --> 01:06:46,974
She told me the Mullins's daughter
was coming for her.

476
01:06:46,999 --> 01:06:49,475
The Mullins' had a daughter?

477
01:06:49,821 --> 01:06:52,283
She died a long time ago.

478
01:06:52,487 --> 01:06:54,873
So, she's seeing ghost?

479
01:06:56,351 --> 01:06:58,207
Keep your voice down.

480
01:06:58,455 --> 01:07:00,664
So, she's seeing ghost?

481
01:07:01,192 --> 01:07:02,765
I guess.

482
01:07:03,143 --> 01:07:06,271
Well...
You guys saw something.

483
01:07:06,458 --> 01:07:08,047
That wasn't a ghost.

484
01:07:08,048 --> 01:07:10,527
Ghost can only be
of dead people.

485
01:07:11,246 --> 01:07:13,712
How does that explain
what you saw?

486
01:07:13,737 --> 01:07:16,415
Unless it really was Mrs Mullins.

487
01:07:17,481 --> 01:07:22,059
Or...
something was just trying to scare you.

488
01:07:22,698 --> 01:07:25,570
You guys are doing a good job
with that on your own.

489
01:07:30,101 --> 01:07:34,536
Janice is probably just looking for ways
to justify us treating her differently.

490
01:07:35,112 --> 01:07:36,737
I don't think so.

491
01:07:36,738 --> 01:07:38,078
Of course you don't.

492
01:07:38,079 --> 01:07:40,228
You'll know what I mean
when you're older.

493
01:07:40,321 --> 01:07:42,352
Now go get to bed.

494
01:08:17,073 --> 01:08:18,988
What are you waiting for?

495
01:08:19,013 --> 01:08:20,595
Nothing.

496
01:08:24,797 --> 01:08:26,454
You like it?

497
01:08:26,982 --> 01:08:28,647
It's nice.

498
01:08:33,114 --> 01:08:35,354
It's not my finest work.

499
01:08:46,201 --> 01:08:48,055
You seem troubled.

500
01:08:48,815 --> 01:08:50,543
Maybe I can help.

501
01:08:51,764 --> 01:08:53,671
I don't think so.

502
01:08:53,701 --> 01:08:57,136
Talking about the things
that bothers us sometimes...

503
01:08:57,805 --> 01:08:59,769
all the help we need.

504
01:09:01,058 --> 01:09:02,506
Well...

505
01:09:04,257 --> 01:09:06,249
It's Janice.

506
01:09:06,250 --> 01:09:08,578
She's acting funny.

507
01:09:09,538 --> 01:09:11,384
Acting funny?

508
01:09:12,421 --> 01:09:14,361
She says...

509
01:09:16,100 --> 01:09:18,583
she's seen your daughter.

510
01:09:20,669 --> 01:09:22,411
My daughter...

511
01:09:24,919 --> 01:09:28,183
has been dead for a
very very long time.

512
01:09:30,443 --> 01:09:32,116
I know, but...

513
01:09:32,472 --> 01:09:35,875
You see,
Janice went into her bedroom.

514
01:09:35,876 --> 01:09:37,244
She what?

515
01:09:37,936 --> 01:09:40,795
She knows she wasn't suppose to
but...

516
01:09:40,796 --> 01:09:43,994
- she found this doll and...
- What doll?

517
01:09:44,598 --> 01:09:46,183
The one in the white dress.

518
01:09:46,184 --> 01:09:47,788
That's impossible!

519
01:09:47,789 --> 01:09:49,814
That doll was hidden away.

520
01:09:49,815 --> 01:09:51,726
She mustn't go near that doll!

521
01:09:51,727 --> 01:09:53,444
You understand me?

522
01:11:07,147 --> 01:11:08,847
Found you

523
01:11:20,795 --> 01:11:23,475
Janice, I told you
not to use that room.

524
01:11:23,829 --> 01:11:29,924
Please don't take
my sunshine away...

525
01:12:07,578 --> 01:12:09,618
Ahhh!

526
01:12:09,756 --> 01:12:11,319
Stay here.

527
01:12:13,358 --> 01:12:15,053
Mr Mullins.

528
01:12:20,667 --> 01:12:22,972
Mr Mullins, are you okay?

529
01:12:41,427 --> 01:12:43,524
Go get ready for bed, girls.

530
01:12:43,525 --> 01:12:45,916
I need to speak to Mrs Mullins.

531
01:15:55,425 --> 01:15:58,459
Linda.
What are you doing?

532
01:15:58,793 --> 01:16:00,132
This doll.

533
01:16:00,133 --> 01:16:03,257
It's hurting Janice
and it killed Mr Mullins.

534
01:16:03,373 --> 01:16:05,300
I'm getting rid of it!

535
01:16:12,223 --> 01:16:14,263
Linda, let's go back.

536
01:16:29,129 --> 01:16:30,585
Linda?

537
01:16:37,576 --> 01:16:39,165
No!

538
01:16:57,155 --> 01:16:58,109
What is that?

539
01:16:58,134 --> 01:17:00,212
Who cares!
Run!

540
01:17:09,771 --> 01:17:12,377
Janice. Janice.
I got rid of it.

541
01:17:12,402 --> 01:17:14,532
I got rid of the doll.

542
01:17:17,314 --> 01:17:18,734
Janice.

543
01:17:18,735 --> 01:17:20,056
Janice.

544
01:17:20,136 --> 01:17:21,988
- What's going on?
- Where is Janice?

545
01:17:21,989 --> 01:17:24,164
- I don't know.
- Go find her.

546
01:17:24,165 --> 01:17:25,539
Hurry!

547
01:17:30,912 --> 01:17:32,185
What's going on?

548
01:17:32,186 --> 01:17:33,159
No!

549
01:17:33,160 --> 01:17:35,438
No!
Get that thing away from me!

550
01:17:38,202 --> 01:17:39,740
It's back.

551
01:17:39,765 --> 01:17:41,726
I know it was back.

552
01:17:41,751 --> 01:17:43,437
What is it?

553
01:17:44,614 --> 01:17:46,076
Evil.

554
01:17:46,835 --> 01:17:49,062
The devil itself.

555
01:17:49,836 --> 01:17:51,600
What are you talking about?

556
01:17:52,731 --> 01:17:56,431
After Samuel and I...
lost our daughter

557
01:17:56,709 --> 01:18:00,090
we prayed and promised
our devotion to

558
01:18:00,091 --> 01:18:02,532
whatever power that
would allow us to

559
01:18:02,533 --> 01:18:06,514
speak or see our
beloved girl again.

560
01:18:07,341 --> 01:18:10,449
It started small,
the contact.

561
01:18:16,079 --> 01:18:17,852
But it was her.

562
01:18:18,231 --> 01:18:20,028
Our busy Bee.

563
01:18:20,287 --> 01:18:22,187
We know it was her.

564
01:18:23,575 --> 01:18:26,316
She wanted permission
to move into the doll

565
01:18:26,317 --> 01:18:28,953
so she could be
with us forever.

566
01:18:39,579 --> 01:18:41,315
please

567
01:18:41,525 --> 01:18:43,396
We said yes.

568
01:18:43,421 --> 01:18:46,584
And that's when it became stronger.

569
01:18:49,302 --> 01:18:51,882
Soon we can actually see her.

570
01:18:52,467 --> 01:18:56,029
Only in fleeting glimpses
but it was enough.

571
01:18:57,104 --> 01:18:59,223
Our beloved Bee.

572
01:18:59,569 --> 01:19:01,110
Our darling.

573
01:19:01,233 --> 01:19:03,014
Annabelle?

574
01:19:10,998 --> 01:19:13,179
Even though I couldn't hold her.

575
01:19:13,180 --> 01:19:17,339
It was comforting to start
the past activity again.

576
01:19:21,455 --> 01:19:25,515
But we soon realised
it wasn't our Annabelle at all.

577
01:19:35,053 --> 01:19:40,802
You are my sunshine,
my only sunshine

578
01:19:41,299 --> 01:19:43,888
You make me happy ...

579
01:19:44,670 --> 01:19:47,051
when skies are gray

580
01:19:48,366 --> 01:19:51,056
You'll never know dear,

581
01:19:51,329 --> 01:19:53,946
how much I love you

582
01:19:54,571 --> 01:20:00,342
Please don't take my sunshine away

583
01:20:27,791 --> 01:20:29,270
Esther?

584
01:20:29,964 --> 01:20:31,424
Esther.

585
01:20:35,942 --> 01:20:38,549
My... eye...

586
01:20:43,851 --> 01:20:46,075
It was a demonic presence.

587
01:20:46,076 --> 01:20:48,736
And it was using our
Annabelle to manipulate us

588
01:20:48,737 --> 01:20:51,445
into giving it soul
it couldn't have.

589
01:20:51,446 --> 01:20:53,513
It tried to take mine.

590
01:20:53,514 --> 01:20:56,390
But Samuel reached out
to the church.

591
01:20:57,167 --> 01:20:58,759
They saved my soul

592
01:20:58,760 --> 01:21:02,188
but the evil was still
attached to that doll.

593
01:21:03,339 --> 01:21:05,695
So we locked it away

594
01:21:05,700 --> 01:21:08,900
where it could be surrounded
by the word of god.

595
01:21:52,938 --> 01:21:56,174
It was quiet
for all these year.

596
01:21:56,243 --> 01:21:58,886
I thought the evil was contained.

597
01:22:00,047 --> 01:22:03,477
We thought helping the girls
could be our penance.

598
01:22:03,672 --> 01:22:07,083
But we end up giving it
just what it wanted.

599
01:22:07,092 --> 01:22:11,756
You are my sunshine,
my only sunshine

600
01:22:11,757 --> 01:22:16,279
You make me happy
when skies are gray

601
01:22:18,010 --> 01:22:20,494
- You'll never know dear,
- Janice.

602
01:22:20,495 --> 01:22:23,004
how much I love you

603
01:22:23,183 --> 01:22:26,883
Please don't take my sunshine away

604
01:22:26,884 --> 01:22:28,619
She can walk.

605
01:22:28,876 --> 01:22:31,034
It's just us, Janice.

606
01:22:32,073 --> 01:22:34,588
Time to cease from sin, Carol.

607
01:22:41,108 --> 01:22:42,851
Sister Charlotte!
Sister Charlotte!

608
01:22:42,852 --> 01:22:44,232
It's-It's Janice.

609
01:22:44,233 --> 01:22:45,987
- She's... She's...
- Look what she did!

610
01:22:45,988 --> 01:22:47,781
- Carol, call for help.
- Okay.

611
01:22:47,782 --> 01:22:50,055
- And stay together.
- Okay.

612
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:57,729
They're on their way.
Let get somewhere safe.

613
01:23:01,978 --> 01:23:03,354
What do we do?

614
01:23:03,355 --> 01:23:06,200
We can't just leave her here,
can we?

615
01:23:17,794 --> 01:23:19,554
Mrs Mullins?

616
01:23:21,965 --> 01:23:23,675
Mrs Mullins?

617
01:23:25,415 --> 01:23:27,265
Mrs Mullins?

618
01:23:45,240 --> 01:23:46,726
Girls.

619
01:23:46,900 --> 01:23:49,245
Let's go.
Now!

620
01:23:52,430 --> 01:23:56,691
Forgive me, sister,
for I have sinned.

621
01:24:26,284 --> 01:24:28,874
- Sister Charlotte! Sister Charlotte!
- Run!

622
01:24:32,587 --> 01:24:34,285
Linda!

623
01:24:36,173 --> 01:24:38,645
Go, Tierney!
Get help!

624
01:24:38,750 --> 01:24:40,343
Or...

625
01:24:40,813 --> 01:24:42,694
... you can help me.

626
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:56,501
The truck!

627
01:24:57,664 --> 01:24:59,740
Come on.
Come on.

628
01:25:01,340 --> 01:25:03,728
- Close the door! Close the door!
- Come on!

629
01:25:03,729 --> 01:25:05,762
Go!
Go.

630
01:25:11,883 --> 01:25:14,130
- No!
- No! Come on!

631
01:25:17,472 --> 01:25:18,885
Okay.

632
01:25:20,499 --> 01:25:22,250
No!

633
01:25:22,270 --> 01:25:24,195
I'm trying!

634
01:25:31,874 --> 01:25:34,059
- It's not starting!
- I'm trying!

635
01:25:34,084 --> 01:25:35,504
Guys!

636
01:25:38,755 --> 01:25:41,278
- Guys! Guys!
- What? What?

637
01:25:41,776 --> 01:25:43,042
The scarecrow.

638
01:25:43,067 --> 01:25:45,056
What scarecrow?

639
01:25:46,220 --> 01:25:47,427
What...

640
01:25:49,894 --> 01:25:51,946
- Kate.
- Come on!

641
01:26:11,323 --> 01:26:13,290
Come on!
Run!

642
01:26:18,469 --> 01:26:19,949
Carol?

643
01:26:22,783 --> 01:26:24,036
What?

644
01:26:26,929 --> 01:26:28,275
No!
No!

645
01:26:28,483 --> 01:26:31,229
Nancy, I can't get the door open.
Is it locked?

646
01:26:31,230 --> 01:26:33,387
Can you get it from your side?

647
01:26:34,388 --> 01:26:35,925
Girls.

648
01:26:36,640 --> 01:26:38,399
Nancy?

649
01:28:09,658 --> 01:28:10,640
No.

650
01:28:10,641 --> 01:28:12,113
No.
No.

651
01:29:32,094 --> 01:29:34,703
Lord, help me.
Lord, help.

652
01:29:34,728 --> 01:29:36,767
Help...

653
01:29:37,752 --> 01:29:39,217
Carol, it's me.

654
01:29:39,218 --> 01:29:40,662
It's just me.

655
01:29:41,273 --> 01:29:42,916
Now, come on.

656
01:29:48,595 --> 01:29:50,354
Linda.

657
01:31:54,185 --> 01:31:55,844
She's loon.

658
01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:09,431
No!

659
01:32:11,318 --> 01:32:12,750
No!

660
01:33:29,849 --> 01:33:31,941
Sister Charlotte?

661
01:33:57,922 --> 01:34:01,335
You know what I like most
about Sweet Sue?

662
01:34:05,850 --> 01:34:08,500
She looks just like you.

663
01:34:45,712 --> 01:34:47,339
Linda?

664
01:34:48,702 --> 01:34:51,585
Where are you, Linda?

665
01:34:54,929 --> 01:34:56,635
Linda?

666
01:35:07,703 --> 01:35:11,868
Linda, come out and play.

667
01:35:36,700 --> 01:35:38,231
Found you!

668
01:35:40,795 --> 01:35:43,079
You swore if I found a home
you'd come too.

669
01:35:43,080 --> 01:35:45,699
You know what they say
about breaking a swear.

670
01:35:45,700 --> 01:35:47,100
You go straight to hell.

671
01:35:47,125 --> 01:35:48,453
 Janice!

672
01:35:55,126 --> 01:35:56,675
Forgive me.

673
01:35:57,495 --> 01:35:58,897
No!

674
01:36:00,442 --> 01:36:01,969
Let me out!

675
01:36:01,970 --> 01:36:03,770
Let me out!

676
01:36:04,194 --> 01:36:06,624
Let me out... !

677
01:36:47,856 --> 01:36:49,246
Go!

678
01:36:58,240 --> 01:37:00,751
- Sister Charlotte!
- Sister Charlotte!

679
01:38:39,460 --> 01:38:41,096
Anything?

680
01:38:41,320 --> 01:38:43,106
I'm afraid not.

681
01:38:43,343 --> 01:38:45,403
Still no sign of the girl.

682
01:38:45,413 --> 01:38:47,469
But at her age...

683
01:38:47,831 --> 01:38:49,961
how far could she'd gone?

684
01:38:51,990 --> 01:38:53,838
Don't worry.

685
01:38:54,340 --> 01:38:56,119
We'll find her.

686
01:39:02,981 --> 01:39:04,879
This house is blessed.

687
01:39:04,880 --> 01:39:08,375
Whatever evil was here
is no longer.

688
01:39:09,280 --> 01:39:10,712
But...

689
01:39:10,977 --> 01:39:12,707
The doll.

690
01:39:12,846 --> 01:39:15,691
It was a conduit
for the evil.

691
01:39:15,716 --> 01:39:18,116
That evil has moved on.

692
01:39:18,310 --> 01:39:20,695
Now the doll
is just a doll.

693
01:39:20,696 --> 01:39:22,209
So...

694
01:39:22,890 --> 01:39:25,070
... which one of you gets this?

695
01:39:50,366 --> 01:39:52,370
How are you holding up?

696
01:39:54,492 --> 01:39:56,349
I'm okay.

697
01:39:58,956 --> 01:40:02,817
You know, that wasn't Janice back there.
That was...

698
01:40:03,910 --> 01:40:05,848
... something else.

699
01:40:09,690 --> 01:40:11,323
I know.

700
01:40:48,553 --> 01:40:51,037
ST. JOACHIM
ORPHANAGE

701
01:40:51,062 --> 01:40:53,319
Hi there.
Welcome.

702
01:40:53,344 --> 01:40:55,574
Let's go right inside, shall we?

703
01:40:58,146 --> 01:41:00,975
She mostly keeps to herself,
that can be a bit quite,

704
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:02,913
but she's a lovely girl.

705
01:41:02,938 --> 01:41:05,479
She's just been through a lot.

706
01:41:06,510 --> 01:41:08,770
I think you will love her.

707
01:41:11,140 --> 01:41:12,760
Hello.

708
01:41:12,957 --> 01:41:15,470
There's someone here to see you, sweetie.

709
01:41:17,980 --> 01:41:21,913
I want to introduce you to
Mr and Mrs Higgins.

710
01:41:23,306 --> 01:41:25,961
And you must be...

711
01:41:25,986 --> 01:41:28,409
- Annabelle.
- Annabelle.

712
01:41:28,434 --> 01:41:30,621
What a lovely name.

713
01:41:31,462 --> 01:41:33,538
We brought you a present.

714
01:41:36,870 --> 01:41:39,040
I hope you like dolls.

715
01:42:07,245 --> 01:42:15,381
12 YEARS LATER

716
01:42:26,027 --> 01:42:27,790
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.

717
01:42:27,791 --> 01:42:29,225
What is it?

718
01:42:29,226 --> 01:42:30,343
Stay here.

719
01:42:30,344 --> 01:42:31,811
No, no, no!
No, wait.

720
01:42:31,812 --> 01:42:32,996
It's okay.
It's alright, sweetheart.

721
01:42:32,997 --> 01:42:34,337
I'm just going to
take a quick look.

722
01:42:34,338 --> 01:42:36,241
Call the police.

723
01:42:49,926 --> 01:42:52,589
- Annabelle?
- Hi, Mom.

724
01:43:15,049 --> 01:43:16,632
John.
