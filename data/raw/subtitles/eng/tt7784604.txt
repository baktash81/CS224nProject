2
00:03:03,009 --> 00:03:04,927
Come on, Peter.

3
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,684
Wake up. Peter. Wake up.

4
00:03:10,109 --> 00:03:11,536
Here's your suit.

5
00:03:15,755 --> 00:03:18,457
Do you know if your sister
slept in her room last night?

6
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:21,031
I don't know.

7
00:03:23,971 --> 00:03:25,457
Come on, Peter. Get up.

8
00:03:48,045 --> 00:03:51,358
Oh, Charlie.
For God's sake, come on!

9
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,745
It was freezing last night!

10
00:03:56,115 --> 00:03:57,840
That's how you get pneumonia.

11
00:03:58,021 --> 00:03:59,397
That's okay.

12
00:03:59,671 --> 00:04:01,871
Okay, come on.
Let's go. We're late.

13
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,721
Your mother's
in the car already.

14
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:16,595
Um...

15
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,666
It's heartening to see so many
strange new faces here today.

16
00:04:23,448 --> 00:04:27,465
Um, I know my mom
would be very touched

17
00:04:27,869 --> 00:04:30,640
and probably a little
suspicious...

18
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:34,532
um, to see this turnout. So.

19
00:04:38,592 --> 00:04:43,097
My mother was a very secretive
and private woman.

20
00:04:43,327 --> 00:04:45,138
She had private rituals,

21
00:04:45,224 --> 00:04:48,228
private friends,
private anxieties.

22
00:04:48,884 --> 00:04:50,300
It honestly feels
like a betrayal

23
00:04:50,302 --> 00:04:52,552
just to be standing here
talking about her.

24
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,963
<i>She was a very difficult woman
to read.</i>

25
00:05:02,888 --> 00:05:05,774
<i>If you ever thought you knew
what was going on with her,</i>

26
00:05:05,815 --> 00:05:08,151
<i>and God forbid
you tried to confront that.</i>

27
00:05:12,009 --> 00:05:13,394
<i>But when her life
was unpolluted,</i>

28
00:05:13,464 --> 00:05:15,900
<i>she could be
the sweetest, warmest,</i>

29
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:17,955
<i>most loving person
in the world.</i>

30
00:05:19,718 --> 00:05:21,709
She was also
incredibly stubborn,

31
00:05:21,758 --> 00:05:24,315
which maybe, explains me.

32
00:05:26,331 --> 00:05:28,934
You could always count on her
to always have the answer.

33
00:05:30,473 --> 00:05:33,003
And if
she ever was mistaken,

34
00:05:33,063 --> 00:05:35,312
and well,
that was your opinion...

35
00:05:35,347 --> 00:05:40,164
And you were wrong.

36
00:06:03,687 --> 00:06:05,365
There aren't nuts in that?

37
00:06:05,881 --> 00:06:07,349
- No.
- Good.

38
00:06:09,103 --> 00:06:10,731
Does that have nuts? 'Cause
we don't have the EpiPen.

39
00:06:10,733 --> 00:06:11,745
I know.

40
00:06:39,435 --> 00:06:43,525
Hello, Rexy! Good dog.

41
00:06:43,571 --> 00:06:45,136
Shoes off, everybody.

42
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:47,695
Charlie, shoes off.

43
00:06:55,927 --> 00:06:57,365
It does feel weird.

44
00:06:58,732 --> 00:06:59,933
Yeah.

45
00:07:01,361 --> 00:07:02,783
Should I be sadder?

46
00:07:03,578 --> 00:07:07,261
You should be
whatever you are. It'll come.

47
00:07:28,844 --> 00:07:30,851
Hey, how's it going?

48
00:07:30,985 --> 00:07:32,595
Mmm, just working.

49
00:07:33,655 --> 00:07:35,983
Taking a break
from avoiding the show.

50
00:07:40,987 --> 00:07:44,914
So, you still toiling away
at the hospice?

51
00:07:45,322 --> 00:07:48,058
Yeah, between this
and the, uh, preschool.

52
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:52,854
So what's our deadline now?
Seven months?

53
00:07:53,421 --> 00:07:56,191
- Six and a half.
- Ooh, coming up.

54
00:07:57,707 --> 00:07:59,543
Any ideas for titles?

55
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:08,385
Come in.

56
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:10,557
Hey...

57
00:08:10,741 --> 00:08:12,709
- Goodnight, kiddo.
- Goodnight.

58
00:08:15,459 --> 00:08:18,866
Are you, uh... Are you feeling
okay about everything?

59
00:08:18,952 --> 00:08:20,828
Yeah. Fine.

60
00:08:21,577 --> 00:08:22,944
A little sad?

61
00:08:23,922 --> 00:08:26,296
Mmm...

62
00:08:26,393 --> 00:08:29,523
Yeah, I get it. I know.

63
00:08:29,844 --> 00:08:31,503
- Goodnight.
- Night.

64
00:08:31,559 --> 00:08:32,860
Love you.

65
00:08:48,055 --> 00:08:49,090
Who's this?

66
00:08:51,775 --> 00:08:53,108
That's Grandma?

67
00:09:04,025 --> 00:09:06,090
You know
you were her favorite, right?

68
00:09:07,631 --> 00:09:09,533
Even when
you were a little baby,

69
00:09:09,535 --> 00:09:10,258
she wouldn't let me feed you

70
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,932
because she needed
to feed you.

71
00:09:12,121 --> 00:09:13,648
Drove me crazy.

72
00:09:14,672 --> 00:09:16,682
She wanted me to be a boy.

73
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,684
You know, I was a tomboy
when I was growing up.

74
00:09:24,248 --> 00:09:28,511
I hated dresses
and dolls and pink.

75
00:09:30,305 --> 00:09:32,140
Who's gonna take care of me?

76
00:09:32,357 --> 00:09:35,298
Um, excuse me.

77
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,399
You don't think
I'm gonna take care of you?

78
00:09:38,812 --> 00:09:40,360
But when you die.

79
00:09:43,368 --> 00:09:44,641
Well, then...

80
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:47,420
Dad will take care of you.

81
00:09:48,678 --> 00:09:50,065
Or Peter.

82
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,642
You never cried as a baby.

83
00:10:10,513 --> 00:10:12,014
You know that?

84
00:10:13,735 --> 00:10:15,504
Even when you were born.

85
00:10:24,524 --> 00:10:26,621
Did you feel
like you wanted to cry today?

86
00:10:31,724 --> 00:10:33,894
You think it might feel
like a relief?

87
00:10:59,248 --> 00:11:00,651
Goodnight, sweetheart.

88
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,854
Mom?

89
00:13:34,694 --> 00:13:36,864
I just scared myself
in the workshop.

90
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:40,453
With... With what?

91
00:13:45,627 --> 00:13:46,696
No.

92
00:14:08,578 --> 00:14:09,746
Are you done?

93
00:14:11,681 --> 00:14:12,916
Almost.

94
00:14:14,148 --> 00:14:17,598
So, maybe we finish the toy
after the quiz.

95
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:18,846
What do you think?

96
00:14:20,804 --> 00:14:22,299
- Okay.
- Okay.

97
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,305
Oh, my God! What was that?

98
00:14:46,859 --> 00:14:48,609
So, if we go by the rule

99
00:14:48,663 --> 00:14:52,019
that the hero is undone
by his fatal flaw,

100
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:54,641
what is Heracles' flaw?

101
00:14:55,837 --> 00:14:57,039
Arrogance.

102
00:14:57,093 --> 00:14:59,631
Okay. Why?

103
00:15:00,049 --> 00:15:02,819
Because he literally refuses
to look at all the signs

104
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:05,781
that are literally handed
to him the entire play.

105
00:15:06,348 --> 00:15:08,459
Okay, interesting.

106
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:10,771
So he thinks he has control.

107
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:12,270
But let's all remember,

108
00:15:12,349 --> 00:15:15,404
Sophocles wrote the oracle
so that it was unconditional,

109
00:15:15,467 --> 00:15:19,433
meaning, Heracles never had
any choice, right?

110
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:22,329
So does that make it
more tragic or less tragic

111
00:15:22,385 --> 00:15:24,638
that if he has a choice?

112
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:26,683
- Less.
- Okay.

113
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:28,683
- Why?
- Because.

114
00:15:31,486 --> 00:15:33,254
Care to
weigh in, Peter?

115
00:15:34,954 --> 00:15:36,949
Um, about which part?

116
00:15:39,201 --> 00:15:40,291
I think it's more tragic

117
00:15:40,293 --> 00:15:42,069
because if it's all
just inevitable,

118
00:15:42,071 --> 00:15:44,490
then that means that
the characters had no hope.

119
00:15:44,599 --> 00:15:45,400
They never had hope

120
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:47,290
because they're all just,
like, hopeless.

121
00:15:47,389 --> 00:15:48,251
They're all like pawns

122
00:15:48,253 --> 00:15:50,811
in this horrible,
hopeless machine.

123
00:17:04,844 --> 00:17:06,813
- Hello!
- Hi!

124
00:17:49,273 --> 00:17:50,808
Did you go up
in my mom's room?

125
00:17:52,053 --> 00:17:53,187
No.

126
00:17:53,973 --> 00:17:55,774
Mmm. Door was open.

127
00:18:01,788 --> 00:18:02,756
Hello?

128
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,402
Sorry. I know it's irrational.

129
00:18:04,466 --> 00:18:06,168
- No problem.
- Thank you.

130
00:18:07,173 --> 00:18:09,320
Hey, Dad. It's the cemetery.

131
00:18:09,635 --> 00:18:10,771
About what?

132
00:18:11,629 --> 00:18:12,829
Let me see.

133
00:18:13,529 --> 00:18:16,249
Hello? Yes.

134
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,020
What does that mean?

135
00:18:25,768 --> 00:18:27,104
Desecrated?

136
00:18:31,672 --> 00:18:33,375
But it's only been a week.

137
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,753
Yes, okay, yes. Sure.

138
00:18:39,884 --> 00:18:41,325
All right. I understand.
Yes...

139
00:18:41,381 --> 00:18:44,290
Uh, why don't I call you back?
Yes. Goodbye.

140
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:45,467
What was it?

141
00:18:47,319 --> 00:18:49,740
Uh, just some billing crap.

142
00:18:51,024 --> 00:18:53,448
Okay, well, I'm, uh...
I'm gonna go see a movie.

143
00:18:54,576 --> 00:18:55,682
Okay.

144
00:19:23,155 --> 00:19:23,867
He would say

145
00:19:23,869 --> 00:19:27,237
"I'm a burden, I'm a burden,
I'm a burden."

146
00:19:31,391 --> 00:19:33,684
And I would
tell him, "No, no."

147
00:19:40,651 --> 00:19:43,560
But yes,
he was a burden.

148
00:19:44,265 --> 00:19:47,376
Now we've set aside
some time for any newcomers

149
00:19:47,428 --> 00:19:49,213
who might like to speak.

150
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:50,989
So, anyone.

151
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:54,456
If it's your first
or second time with us,

152
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:56,097
the floor is open.

153
00:19:59,811 --> 00:20:02,705
Yes. Would you like to...

154
00:20:02,773 --> 00:20:04,015
Maybe not.

155
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,301
Okay. No pressure.

156
00:20:14,956 --> 00:20:16,090
My name's Annie.

157
00:20:16,317 --> 00:20:17,623
Hi, Annie.

158
00:20:19,305 --> 00:20:21,164
My mom died a week ago.

159
00:20:21,455 --> 00:20:24,645
So I'm just here
for trying it.

160
00:20:25,704 --> 00:20:28,241
I have a lot of resistance
to things like this,

161
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:31,400
but I came to these
a couple years ago.

162
00:20:31,441 --> 00:20:34,552
Well, I was forced to come
and I guess it, um...

163
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:37,941
I guess it helped. So, um...

164
00:20:40,932 --> 00:20:44,527
My mom was old and she wasn't
all together there at the end.

165
00:20:44,609 --> 00:20:46,955
And we were pretty much
estranged before that,

166
00:20:46,957 --> 00:20:49,881
so it really wasn't
a huge blow.

167
00:20:50,174 --> 00:20:55,419
But I did love her.

168
00:20:56,852 --> 00:20:58,303
And she didn't have
an easy life.

169
00:20:58,354 --> 00:21:01,493
She had DID, which became
extreme at the end.

170
00:21:01,712 --> 00:21:03,179
And dementia.

171
00:21:03,281 --> 00:21:07,319
And my father died when I was
a baby from starvation,

172
00:21:07,401 --> 00:21:10,221
um, because he had
psychotic depression

173
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:11,019
and he starved himself,

174
00:21:11,021 --> 00:21:13,289
which I'm sure was just
as pleasant as it sounds.

175
00:21:13,346 --> 00:21:14,880
And then there's my brother.

176
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:16,932
My older brother
had schizophrenia

177
00:21:16,996 --> 00:21:18,263
and when he was 16

178
00:21:18,303 --> 00:21:20,040
he hanged himself
in my mother's bedroom

179
00:21:20,102 --> 00:21:21,752
and of course
the suicide note blamed her

180
00:21:21,788 --> 00:21:25,192
accusing her of putting people
inside him. So.

181
00:21:28,938 --> 00:21:30,874
That was my mom's life.

182
00:21:43,344 --> 00:21:44,576
And then she lived
in our house

183
00:21:44,578 --> 00:21:46,293
at the end before hospice.

184
00:21:46,329 --> 00:21:47,849
We weren't even talking
before that.

185
00:21:47,917 --> 00:21:49,914
I mean, we were
and then we weren't.

186
00:21:50,203 --> 00:21:51,810
And then we were.

187
00:21:54,719 --> 00:21:56,276
She's completely manipulative.

188
00:21:56,312 --> 00:21:59,701
Until my husband finally
enforced a no-contact rule,

189
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:02,024
which lasted until I got
pregnant with my daughter.

190
00:22:02,119 --> 00:22:03,191
I didn't let her
anywhere near me

191
00:22:03,193 --> 00:22:04,847
when I had my first, my son,

192
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,716
which is why I gave her
my daughter,

193
00:22:06,718 --> 00:22:09,182
who she immediately
stabbed her hooks into.

194
00:22:09,558 --> 00:22:12,278
And I just...
I felt guilty again.

195
00:22:12,321 --> 00:22:13,760
I felt guilty again.

196
00:22:14,017 --> 00:22:15,060
When she got sick,

197
00:22:15,062 --> 00:22:17,303
not that she was really even
my mom at the end,

198
00:22:17,305 --> 00:22:21,944
and not that she would ever
feel guilty about anything.

199
00:22:26,551 --> 00:22:30,102
And I just don't want to put
any more stress on my family.

200
00:22:32,412 --> 00:22:34,736
I'm not even really sure
if they could...

201
00:22:36,315 --> 00:22:38,150
Could give me that support.

202
00:22:41,647 --> 00:22:43,483
And I just...
I just feel like...

203
00:22:46,989 --> 00:22:49,047
I just sometimes
feel like it's all ruined.

204
00:22:51,847 --> 00:22:56,020
And then I realize
that I am to blame.

205
00:22:58,631 --> 00:22:59,665
Or not that I'm to blame,

206
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:04,483
but I am blamed! I'm...

207
00:23:05,671 --> 00:23:09,358
And what do you think
you feel blamed for?

208
00:23:12,718 --> 00:23:14,084
I don't know.

209
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:19,249
<i>Hey, what's
going on in town</i>

210
00:23:19,251 --> 00:23:21,070
<i>anyway, Mister?
A convention or something?</i>

211
00:23:21,072 --> 00:23:21,780
<i>What?</i>

212
00:23:21,782 --> 00:23:23,012
<i>Well, those clothes
you're wearing.</i>

213
00:23:23,014 --> 00:23:23,990
<i>I talked to a guy this morning</i>

214
00:23:23,992 --> 00:23:25,957
<i>who was wearing
the same kind of outfit.</i>

215
00:23:26,074 --> 00:23:28,349
<i>Maybe it's the guy
you're looking for, huh?</i>

216
00:23:28,351 --> 00:23:29,718
<i>You spoke to him?</i>

217
00:23:30,069 --> 00:23:32,088
<i>What did he tell you?
Where did he go?</i>

218
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,445
<i>Hey, what's the matter
with you?</i>

219
00:23:33,509 --> 00:23:34,684
<i>Hey, take your hands off me.</i>

220
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,214
<i>You will tell me
what he said to you!</i>

221
00:23:36,268 --> 00:23:37,300
<i>Well why should I?</i>

222
00:23:37,351 --> 00:23:38,951
<i>Hey, who do you think
you are anyway?</i>

223
00:23:41,126 --> 00:23:42,514
<i>He came in
with the dog tags!</i>

224
00:23:42,633 --> 00:23:43,799
<i>Wanted to know
about the address</i>

225
00:23:43,801 --> 00:23:45,010
<i>and I told him how to find it.</i>

226
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,051
Where?

227
00:25:51,113 --> 00:25:54,771
Hey, um, do you think
I could maybe borrow

228
00:25:54,773 --> 00:25:56,307
one of the cars tonight?

229
00:25:56,567 --> 00:25:58,994
Why? Where are you going?

230
00:25:59,171 --> 00:26:01,905
Oh, just like
a school barbecue thing.

231
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,891
Oh, so you're not eating
with us?

232
00:26:04,054 --> 00:26:05,776
No, I was still gonna
eat here.

233
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,317
Well, you can eat there
if you want. I just didn't...

234
00:26:07,319 --> 00:26:09,941
No, no, no. I'm gonna
eat here. I just, I...

235
00:26:09,996 --> 00:26:12,699
Just be going to hang out.

236
00:26:15,284 --> 00:26:16,486
No drinking?

237
00:26:18,009 --> 00:26:21,047
We're not even old enough
to get drinks if we wanted to.

238
00:26:21,354 --> 00:26:24,223
Well, that's a crock. I'm just
asking if you're drinking.

239
00:26:24,637 --> 00:26:26,271
Well, I just answered no.

240
00:26:28,016 --> 00:26:29,695
You gonna take your sister?

241
00:26:31,197 --> 00:26:34,056
Uh... Does she want to go?

242
00:26:34,689 --> 00:26:37,358
Have you asked her?

243
00:26:41,045 --> 00:26:42,213
Charlie?

244
00:27:12,623 --> 00:27:13,703
Charlie!

245
00:27:15,819 --> 00:27:20,029
I mean, what are you doing?
Leaving the house barefoot?

246
00:27:20,227 --> 00:27:21,251
Are you some kind of idiot?

247
00:27:21,253 --> 00:27:23,960
You can't roam around
with no shoes and no coat.

248
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:25,896
- I want Grandma.
- Oh.

249
00:27:26,504 --> 00:27:29,030
Oh, what?
You're angry with me now?

250
00:27:32,439 --> 00:27:34,878
You are going to this...
Hey, socks off.

251
00:27:35,018 --> 00:27:36,821
You're going to this party
with your brother.

252
00:27:37,485 --> 00:27:38,421
What party?

253
00:27:38,423 --> 00:27:41,134
Some school hangout
with other kids.

254
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:43,469
That's okay.

255
00:27:43,471 --> 00:27:46,592
No, it's not okay.
You're going.

256
00:27:46,716 --> 00:27:48,188
- Why?
- Because it'll be fun.

257
00:27:48,244 --> 00:27:50,176
Because you'll get to hang out
with other kids.

258
00:27:50,239 --> 00:27:51,452
- With who?
- With your...

259
00:27:51,504 --> 00:27:53,204
With your brother.
With other kids.

260
00:27:58,542 --> 00:28:00,126
- Fine.
- Good. You're going.

261
00:28:00,158 --> 00:28:02,161
- She's going with you.
- Great.

262
00:28:02,215 --> 00:28:04,057
Now this really means
no drinking.

263
00:28:04,126 --> 00:28:05,895
Yeah, I really wasn't
going to.

264
00:29:42,267 --> 00:29:43,746
<i>Whoa. Hi.</i>

265
00:29:45,173 --> 00:29:46,475
Oh. Hi.

266
00:29:47,135 --> 00:29:48,470
How's the party?

267
00:29:49,671 --> 00:29:51,834
Why? You wanna know
if you should come?

268
00:29:52,231 --> 00:29:54,245
Uh, yeah. What do ya think?

269
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:58,045
Either way.

270
00:30:00,698 --> 00:30:03,067
Hey, do you happen
to smoke at all?

271
00:30:03,107 --> 00:30:04,742
I have really good weed.

272
00:30:11,156 --> 00:30:13,425
- The other room has a bong.
- Sick.

273
00:30:18,965 --> 00:30:20,463
Do you wanna wait out here
for a second?

274
00:30:20,528 --> 00:30:22,569
- No.
- Charlie, please, just...

275
00:30:22,634 --> 00:30:24,454
It'll be two minutes
and then we can hang out.

276
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:27,468
You can draw.
Please, Charlie. I'm...

277
00:30:29,074 --> 00:30:31,212
Oh, shit, look. They're
giving out chocolate cake.

278
00:30:31,214 --> 00:30:32,471
Not to everyone.

279
00:30:32,473 --> 00:30:33,812
Yes to everyone. It's a party.

280
00:30:33,859 --> 00:30:35,854
- I don't know anyone.
- Nobody does.

281
00:30:35,909 --> 00:30:38,663
Just walk over and stand there
and they'll give you a piece.

282
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,489
Hurry up. They're gonna
run out. Come on, Charlie.

283
00:30:46,364 --> 00:30:49,769
Hey, guys. Peter has weed.

284
00:31:13,665 --> 00:31:15,303
That was
your sister downstairs?

285
00:31:15,616 --> 00:31:17,643
Yeah. Charlie.

286
00:31:19,566 --> 00:31:20,834
Is your sister hot?

287
00:31:23,637 --> 00:31:25,627
I actually saw her
drawing me last week.

288
00:31:25,832 --> 00:31:26,759
Oh, yeah?

289
00:31:26,827 --> 00:31:29,553
Yeah. She made me
look retarded.

290
00:31:29,858 --> 00:31:31,224
Yeah. That's Charlie.

291
00:32:00,538 --> 00:32:02,005
Peter?

292
00:32:02,194 --> 00:32:05,064
Charlie.

293
00:32:05,417 --> 00:32:07,687
What's up?

294
00:32:12,087 --> 00:32:13,389
Are you okay?

295
00:32:14,988 --> 00:32:16,858
It's hard to breathe.

296
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,587
What do you mean?

297
00:32:20,781 --> 00:32:22,909
I think my throat's
getting bigger.

298
00:33:12,336 --> 00:33:14,406
It's okay, Charlie. We're
almost at the hospital, okay?

299
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,482
Charlie!

300
00:34:54,396 --> 00:34:55,719
You okay.

301
00:34:58,848 --> 00:34:59,982
Okay.

302
00:36:08,224 --> 00:36:10,290
Okay, good.
They're home.

303
00:36:10,953 --> 00:36:12,020
Good.

304
00:37:09,029 --> 00:37:11,189
I'm running out
for some balsam wood.

305
00:37:11,191 --> 00:37:12,417
You want anything?

306
00:37:12,463 --> 00:37:14,919
I'm good, sweetheart.
Drive safe.

307
00:37:14,974 --> 00:37:17,600
Okay. Back in 20.

308
00:37:55,165 --> 00:37:58,622
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

309
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:07,436
Oh, no. I can't, I can't...

310
00:38:07,566 --> 00:38:12,980
I just want to die!

311
00:38:19,045 --> 00:38:21,754
Oh, God. It hurts too much!

312
00:38:21,756 --> 00:38:23,894
I just need to die!

313
00:38:28,483 --> 00:38:31,845
Charlie!

314
00:38:35,924 --> 00:38:39,787
Oh, God.

315
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:49,071
Oh, Charlie!

316
00:42:21,727 --> 00:42:24,269
Hey, are you guys friends
with Becky on Facebook?

317
00:42:24,871 --> 00:42:26,573
You're friends with Becky?

318
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:29,698
I said "Facebook friends."

319
00:42:30,619 --> 00:42:32,415
But seriously,
you see her statuses, bro?

320
00:42:32,417 --> 00:42:34,204
Oh, my God,
dude, I know.

321
00:42:34,251 --> 00:42:36,738
- Like, every ten seconds.
- For real.

322
00:42:36,784 --> 00:42:40,539
Oh, dude, what about, uh,
fucking... Let me hit that.

323
00:42:40,602 --> 00:42:42,672
- Brian?
- Brian and his girlfriend.

324
00:42:42,745 --> 00:42:43,981
He calls her something...

325
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:46,109
He calls her something really
goofy, dude. What does he...

326
00:42:46,172 --> 00:42:47,270
Oh, he calls her princess.

327
00:42:49,969 --> 00:42:52,062
Who fucking calls
their girlfriend "princess"?

328
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:53,777
What the fuck?

329
00:42:53,831 --> 00:42:54,613
Dude, he's like,

330
00:42:54,644 --> 00:42:57,344
"I'm picking up
my princess from the airport.

331
00:42:57,399 --> 00:42:59,603
Fucking eating cous...
What the fuck.

332
00:42:59,666 --> 00:43:00,433
It's couscous.

333
00:43:00,482 --> 00:43:03,619
Couscous. I don't give a shit,
"...with my princess."

334
00:43:03,674 --> 00:43:04,954
You hit that shit?

335
00:43:05,004 --> 00:43:06,111
Who's his girlfriend?

336
00:43:06,167 --> 00:43:09,633
Some, uh, some fucking
stupid college chick.

337
00:43:10,891 --> 00:43:11,845
Oh, damn.

338
00:43:11,930 --> 00:43:14,313
I wanna fucking stupid
college princess, bro.

339
00:43:14,384 --> 00:43:16,093
Yeah.

340
00:43:16,157 --> 00:43:17,895
Oh, hey dude.
Dude, dude, dude.

341
00:43:17,955 --> 00:43:19,089
Are you... Are you all right?

342
00:43:21,853 --> 00:43:24,522
I think I'm having a...
Like a reaction.

343
00:43:25,104 --> 00:43:26,105
My throat is...

344
00:43:26,187 --> 00:43:27,942
I think my throat
is getting bigger.

345
00:43:28,342 --> 00:43:31,614
Dude, it's just it's...
It's just weed.

346
00:43:31,799 --> 00:43:33,520
Chill, man. It's all right.

347
00:43:33,693 --> 00:43:35,475
Just hold my hand. Hold on.

348
00:45:12,293 --> 00:45:15,685
Uh, I'm so sorry
to chase you down.

349
00:45:15,732 --> 00:45:18,334
Uh, were you not
coming in, or...

350
00:45:19,016 --> 00:45:22,337
I... No, I just, um...
I forgot something.

351
00:45:22,390 --> 00:45:25,278
Oh, okay, sorry.
Sorry, I just...

352
00:45:25,323 --> 00:45:27,853
I recognized you
from a few months ago.

353
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:32,468
Oh, God.
I feel very silly. I'm Joan.

354
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:35,067
Hi.

355
00:45:35,123 --> 00:45:36,731
Are you doing better?

356
00:45:37,908 --> 00:45:40,443
- What?
- After your mother?

357
00:45:41,094 --> 00:45:43,565
What? No, no.
That's not...

358
00:45:46,143 --> 00:45:49,065
My, um...
My daughter was killed.

359
00:45:49,469 --> 00:45:52,866
Oh. I'm...

360
00:45:52,928 --> 00:45:55,499
I'm so, so sorry.

361
00:45:56,349 --> 00:45:59,231
Oh, would you like to
come in with me?

362
00:45:59,317 --> 00:46:01,242
Or we could even
just have a coffee.

363
00:46:01,288 --> 00:46:03,991
Uh, I'm sorry.
Really, I, um...

364
00:46:04,077 --> 00:46:06,590
I can't...
I really did forget something.

365
00:46:06,642 --> 00:46:08,050
My son died.

366
00:46:09,836 --> 00:46:11,303
Oh.

367
00:46:13,903 --> 00:46:15,438
I'm so sorry.

368
00:46:16,010 --> 00:46:17,712
How old was yours?

369
00:46:21,330 --> 00:46:22,464
Thirteen.

370
00:46:22,952 --> 00:46:25,829
God. That's awful.

371
00:46:27,578 --> 00:46:33,164
My son and my grandson
drowned four months ago.

372
00:46:33,607 --> 00:46:35,302
The little one was seven.

373
00:46:35,674 --> 00:46:37,090
Oh, my God!

374
00:46:37,883 --> 00:46:41,046
I've been coming here
for a couple of months now.

375
00:46:42,070 --> 00:46:43,690
And it has helped.

376
00:46:43,910 --> 00:46:46,414
It doesn't
make it easier obviously,

377
00:46:46,466 --> 00:46:50,909
but sometimes
it makes it less lonely.

378
00:46:52,814 --> 00:46:54,400
Okay.

379
00:46:54,490 --> 00:46:57,226
And now I'm about to
embarrass myself but, uh,

380
00:46:59,097 --> 00:47:03,535
if you need someone
to talk to...

381
00:47:04,189 --> 00:47:05,893
'Cause we all do.

382
00:47:12,036 --> 00:47:13,638
If you need it.

383
00:47:16,172 --> 00:47:18,963
Okay.

384
00:47:19,143 --> 00:47:21,361
Thank you. Really.

385
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:25,142
Okay.

386
00:47:29,907 --> 00:47:31,120
Bye-bye.

387
00:47:44,049 --> 00:47:45,567
- Hey.
- Hey.

388
00:47:46,991 --> 00:47:49,447
- I'm going to bed.
- Where were you?

389
00:47:49,519 --> 00:47:53,358
At the movies.
Gonna go to bed.

390
00:47:53,406 --> 00:47:55,543
Okay. I'll come up with you.

391
00:47:56,158 --> 00:47:57,272
Okay.

392
00:48:17,516 --> 00:48:19,665
I'll be right back.

393
00:48:20,754 --> 00:48:23,200
No you won't.
You're taking the blanket.

394
00:48:24,039 --> 00:48:25,507
I can't sleep.

395
00:48:27,904 --> 00:48:29,473
It's freezing out there.

396
00:48:30,523 --> 00:48:32,003
Well, the heater's up there.

397
00:48:33,529 --> 00:48:34,663
Okay.

398
00:48:36,472 --> 00:48:37,672
Is that okay?

399
00:48:39,772 --> 00:48:41,743
If it gets too cold,
come back in.

400
00:48:46,686 --> 00:48:48,261
I just need to sleep.

401
00:50:17,846 --> 00:50:18,847
Shit.

402
00:51:22,734 --> 00:51:24,771
Oh, Annie. You came.

403
00:51:24,773 --> 00:51:26,186
It's a little earlier
than we said.

404
00:51:26,188 --> 00:51:28,547
Ah, you're perfect.
Come in. Come in.

405
00:51:35,829 --> 00:51:38,258
Uh, your welcome mat.

406
00:51:38,665 --> 00:51:40,955
Ah!
It's kind of cute, huh?

407
00:51:40,957 --> 00:51:43,734
Yeah. My mother used to
embroider ones just like that.

408
00:51:43,736 --> 00:51:46,070
Did she really?
Isn't that funny?

409
00:51:46,984 --> 00:51:49,019
Please come in. Sit.

410
00:51:50,235 --> 00:51:52,138
First there's the...

411
00:51:53,248 --> 00:51:55,207
The smell of something wrong.

412
00:51:57,105 --> 00:52:01,170
And then the body.

413
00:52:02,230 --> 00:52:08,071
Covered in black blood,
like tar.

414
00:52:13,655 --> 00:52:17,175
And her head wasn't there
so I couldn't see her face.

415
00:52:17,216 --> 00:52:19,687
But they were gone.

416
00:52:20,975 --> 00:52:24,840
And her hands,
and her little finger nails.

417
00:53:00,479 --> 00:53:02,782
How is your relationship
with your son?

418
00:53:04,147 --> 00:53:06,205
- Peter?
- Hmm.

419
00:53:07,389 --> 00:53:09,500
Oh, God. Um...

420
00:53:12,436 --> 00:53:14,406
Okay, I sleepwalk.

421
00:53:16,890 --> 00:53:19,654
I mean, I haven't done it
in years, but, um...

422
00:53:20,369 --> 00:53:23,402
A couple years ago,
I woke up

423
00:53:23,933 --> 00:53:26,982
and I was standing
next to Peter in Charlie's bed

424
00:53:26,984 --> 00:53:30,129
when they shared a room.

425
00:53:32,355 --> 00:53:33,567
And they were

426
00:53:35,501 --> 00:53:38,471
completely covered
in paint thinner.

427
00:53:39,948 --> 00:53:41,551
And so was I.

428
00:53:42,459 --> 00:53:43,995
From head to toe.

429
00:53:47,439 --> 00:53:50,117
And I was standing there
with a box of matches

430
00:53:50,179 --> 00:53:51,900
and an empty can
of paint thinner.

431
00:53:54,437 --> 00:53:56,166
And I woke myself up
striking the match,

432
00:53:56,207 --> 00:53:59,400
which also woke Peter up,
and he started to scream.

433
00:54:01,205 --> 00:54:03,142
And I immediately put
the match out.

434
00:54:03,213 --> 00:54:05,310
Like, immediately.

435
00:54:05,386 --> 00:54:07,865
I mean, I was just
as shocked as he was.

436
00:54:09,157 --> 00:54:12,033
And it was impossible
to convince them

437
00:54:12,035 --> 00:54:14,157
that it was just sleepwalking,

438
00:54:14,276 --> 00:54:18,149
which of course it was, but...

439
00:54:18,865 --> 00:54:20,902
The timing was awful.

440
00:54:20,972 --> 00:54:23,781
Peter and I had gotten into
this stupid quarreling phase,

441
00:54:23,783 --> 00:54:26,853
just forever arguing
about nothing, such...

442
00:54:29,449 --> 00:54:30,951
Frivolous stuff.

443
00:54:34,273 --> 00:54:36,529
And Peter always held it
against me.

444
00:54:37,334 --> 00:54:38,909
And there was nothing
I can say

445
00:54:38,971 --> 00:54:41,007
and nothing I can do

446
00:54:41,288 --> 00:54:44,496
because it happened.

447
00:54:47,749 --> 00:54:49,550
While I was asleep.

448
00:54:53,797 --> 00:54:56,001
Hey! That was quick.

449
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:58,447
Did you bike all the way here?

450
00:54:58,541 --> 00:55:00,808
Um, no. Actually my friend
drove me home.

451
00:55:00,894 --> 00:55:04,007
Oh, uh, by the way,
Peter, have you, um...

452
00:55:04,081 --> 00:55:07,117
Have you signed up for that,
uh, SAT prep course?

453
00:55:07,182 --> 00:55:08,010
I'll do it tomorrow.

454
00:55:08,012 --> 00:55:09,549
Yeah, you know what,
you gotta do that

455
00:55:09,551 --> 00:55:11,085
because it's coming up.

456
00:55:47,279 --> 00:55:49,049
Jesus Christ, Annie.

457
00:55:50,501 --> 00:55:53,026
You're not planning on letting
him see that, are you?

458
00:55:53,096 --> 00:55:54,713
- Who?
- Peter.

459
00:55:54,783 --> 00:55:56,601
How do you think he's gonna
feel when he sees that?

460
00:55:56,603 --> 00:55:58,228
What? It's not about him.

461
00:55:58,230 --> 00:55:59,345
Oh, no?

462
00:55:59,347 --> 00:56:01,745
No. It's a neutral view
of the accident.

463
00:56:11,515 --> 00:56:13,342
Are you, uh, are you
coming down to dinner?

464
00:56:13,398 --> 00:56:14,004
I'm making dinner.

465
00:56:14,006 --> 00:56:16,341
No, I made the dinner.
I came to get you.

466
00:56:16,475 --> 00:56:19,135
Come, stay, whatever you want.
I don't really give a shit.

467
00:57:06,445 --> 00:57:08,041
This is really good, Dad.

468
00:57:09,385 --> 00:57:10,454
Thanks, buddy.

469
00:57:29,837 --> 00:57:31,356
You okay, Mom?

470
00:57:35,110 --> 00:57:36,112
What?

471
00:57:38,342 --> 00:57:40,312
Is there something
on your mind?

472
00:57:42,754 --> 00:57:44,556
Is there something
on your mind?

473
00:57:47,306 --> 00:57:51,988
It just seems like there might
be something you wanna say.

474
00:57:51,990 --> 00:57:53,405
- Peter...
- Like what?

475
00:57:53,444 --> 00:57:55,617
I mean, why would I wanna
say something

476
00:57:55,669 --> 00:57:57,556
so I can watch you
sneer at me.

477
00:57:58,903 --> 00:58:00,813
Sneer at you?
I don't ever sneer at you.

478
00:58:00,892 --> 00:58:01,962
Oh, sweetie.
You don't have to.

479
00:58:01,990 --> 00:58:03,416
You get your point across.

480
00:58:03,618 --> 00:58:05,503
Okay, so fine. Then say
what you wanna say then.

481
00:58:05,567 --> 00:58:06,248
Peter.

482
00:58:06,330 --> 00:58:10,751
I don't wanna say anything.
I've tried saying things.

483
00:58:10,790 --> 00:58:12,235
Okay, so try again.
Release yourself.

484
00:58:12,259 --> 00:58:13,809
Oh, release you, you mean.

485
00:58:13,856 --> 00:58:15,932
Yeah, fine. Release me.
Just say it.

486
00:58:15,964 --> 00:58:17,315
Just fucking say it!

487
00:58:17,364 --> 00:58:19,785
Don't you swear at me,
you little shit!

488
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:21,739
Don't you ever
raise your voice at me!

489
00:58:21,795 --> 00:58:23,623
I am your mother!

490
00:58:23,685 --> 00:58:25,124
Do you understand?

491
00:58:25,126 --> 00:58:29,170
All I do is worry and slave
and defend you.

492
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:32,935
And all I get back is that
fucking face on your face.

493
00:58:33,005 --> 00:58:36,253
So full of disdain
and resentment

494
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:38,175
and always so annoyed.

495
00:58:38,232 --> 00:58:40,293
Well, now your sister is dead.

496
00:58:40,801 --> 00:58:44,120
And I know you miss her,
and I know it was an accident

497
00:58:44,174 --> 00:58:45,484
and I know you're in pain.

498
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:47,560
And I wish I could take that
away for you.

499
00:58:47,623 --> 00:58:50,317
I wish I could shield you
from the knowledge

500
00:58:50,319 --> 00:58:54,374
that you did what you did,
but your sister is dead!

501
00:58:55,054 --> 00:58:56,856
She's gone forever!

502
00:58:58,491 --> 00:59:00,637
And what a waste.

503
00:59:00,699 --> 00:59:03,348
If it could have maybe brought
us together or something.

504
00:59:03,402 --> 00:59:05,389
If you could have just said,
"I'm sorry",

505
00:59:05,436 --> 00:59:07,499
or faced up to what happened.

506
00:59:07,561 --> 00:59:10,064
Maybe then we could do
something with this.

507
00:59:10,134 --> 00:59:12,800
But you can't take
responsibility for anything!

508
00:59:12,881 --> 00:59:15,642
So now I can't accept...

509
00:59:15,743 --> 00:59:19,853
And I can't forgive because...

510
00:59:22,398 --> 00:59:25,656
Because nobody admits
anything they've done!

511
00:59:57,322 --> 00:59:58,723
What about you, Mom?

512
01:00:04,462 --> 01:00:06,329
She didn't wanna go
to the party.

513
01:00:08,357 --> 01:00:10,158
So why was she there?

514
01:00:11,690 --> 01:00:14,092
All right. We're
stopping this right now.

515
01:00:15,841 --> 01:00:17,008
That's it.

516
01:00:19,170 --> 01:00:22,392
I said stop right now.

517
01:00:22,460 --> 01:00:23,695
Fine!

518
01:00:31,315 --> 01:00:32,284
Fine.

519
01:01:45,982 --> 01:01:47,216
Joan?

520
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:50,764
Oh! Annie!

521
01:01:50,766 --> 01:01:53,930
- Hey.
- Oh!

522
01:01:54,305 --> 01:01:56,162
- Annie!
- Hi!

523
01:01:57,481 --> 01:01:59,259
Oh, my!

524
01:01:59,494 --> 01:02:00,986
How are you?

525
01:02:01,057 --> 01:02:03,187
- Oh, Annie! I'm...
- Are you okay?

526
01:02:04,850 --> 01:02:09,222
I'm... I am, yes.
I'm really good.

527
01:02:09,224 --> 01:02:13,333
- I'm really, really...
- Okay.

528
01:02:14,201 --> 01:02:17,856
Something's...
Something happened, Annie,

529
01:02:17,926 --> 01:02:22,720
and I feel completely
turned around.

530
01:02:22,809 --> 01:02:25,082
What happened?

531
01:02:25,152 --> 01:02:27,003
I don't even know
if I should say.

532
01:02:27,005 --> 01:02:28,247
What do you mean?

533
01:02:28,249 --> 01:02:29,985
You're gonna think I am crazy!

534
01:02:29,987 --> 01:02:31,054
No, not at all.

535
01:02:31,118 --> 01:02:33,403
Oh. Okay.

536
01:02:34,365 --> 01:02:35,602
All right, come on.

537
01:02:37,998 --> 01:02:42,510
I met a spiritual medium.

538
01:02:43,904 --> 01:02:46,952
They were performing
an open séance.

539
01:02:46,954 --> 01:02:48,714
I know, I know
what you're thinking,

540
01:02:48,716 --> 01:02:50,482
but they asked me to attend.

541
01:02:50,546 --> 01:02:53,312
They were bringing skeptics
in and scientists.

542
01:02:53,351 --> 01:02:55,994
So I went, fully skeptical.

543
01:02:56,048 --> 01:03:00,489
And what I experienced there,
Annie, was truly...

544
01:03:00,688 --> 01:03:01,433
Open séance...

545
01:03:01,435 --> 01:03:07,403
They brought in the spirit of
a man from the 19th century.

546
01:03:07,474 --> 01:03:11,270
And no, no, not in a kind of
smoke and mirrors way, no.

547
01:03:11,272 --> 01:03:12,475
And the man sitting
next to me

548
01:03:12,477 --> 01:03:15,804
was a completely
cynical neurologist

549
01:03:15,806 --> 01:03:20,149
and he looked permanently
changed by the end of it.

550
01:03:20,204 --> 01:03:23,342
No, I... I... I know
what you're thinking. I do.

551
01:03:23,396 --> 01:03:27,087
But I... I approached
the medium afterwards

552
01:03:27,158 --> 01:03:29,905
and I asked her about my son
and my grandson

553
01:03:29,932 --> 01:03:32,969
and she came to my apartment
and she...

554
01:03:38,510 --> 01:03:40,658
She ended up performing...

555
01:03:41,633 --> 01:03:45,996
Well... She conjured
my grandson.

556
01:03:46,973 --> 01:03:49,844
No, no, no, I know, I know
what that smile is. I know.

557
01:03:49,846 --> 01:03:52,317
Annie, Annie...
I wouldn't believe it either,

558
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:53,931
I didn't believe it,

559
01:03:54,273 --> 01:03:57,853
but I heard his voice.

560
01:03:58,576 --> 01:04:01,371
I felt his presence
in the room.

561
01:04:01,373 --> 01:04:03,832
Annie, this is real.

562
01:04:05,570 --> 01:04:07,345
What are you doing right now?

563
01:04:07,759 --> 01:04:09,410
I'm just here shopping.

564
01:04:09,412 --> 01:04:10,820
Do you wanna come over?

565
01:04:11,023 --> 01:04:14,339
Oh, Annie. Please, Annie.
I really think you should.

566
01:04:14,414 --> 01:04:17,352
It would be everything
if you came.

567
01:04:29,977 --> 01:04:31,613
Nice mood setter.

568
01:04:41,475 --> 01:04:42,875
Okay.

569
01:04:44,614 --> 01:04:46,925
I'm going to put my hand
on the glass,

570
01:04:48,260 --> 01:04:50,403
but I'm not going to
add pressure.

571
01:04:51,281 --> 01:04:52,883
You do the same.

572
01:05:01,665 --> 01:05:03,165
All right.

573
01:05:08,419 --> 01:05:09,815
Louis...

574
01:05:12,305 --> 01:05:15,343
Louis, are you here?
It's Grandma.

575
01:05:26,115 --> 01:05:30,258
Louis, if you are here
with us,

576
01:05:31,457 --> 01:05:34,927
please just try
and slide the glass.

577
01:05:39,345 --> 01:05:43,219
Louis, if you're here...

578
01:05:46,148 --> 01:05:47,449
Hi, Louis!

579
01:05:47,507 --> 01:05:51,014
- Hi, Louis!
- How did you do that?

580
01:05:51,930 --> 01:05:56,324
Louis, I'm going to ask you
some questions. Okay, sweetie?

581
01:05:56,746 --> 01:06:01,077
If the answer is yes,
slide the glass to the right.

582
01:06:01,469 --> 01:06:03,069
If it's no,

583
01:06:03,211 --> 01:06:06,362
slide it the other way,
to the left.

584
01:06:06,494 --> 01:06:08,169
Do you understand?

585
01:06:11,514 --> 01:06:14,787
Louis, are you okay?

586
01:06:17,734 --> 01:06:19,336
Are you in pain?

587
01:06:20,590 --> 01:06:23,834
- Oh, my God!
- It's okay. It's okay.

588
01:06:24,188 --> 01:06:26,068
It's okay. It's okay.

589
01:06:26,131 --> 01:06:29,235
Louis, I brought
your chalkboard.

590
01:06:29,527 --> 01:06:32,229
Remember your chalkboard?

591
01:06:33,202 --> 01:06:35,171
Can you write something?

592
01:07:03,806 --> 01:07:07,714
Oh, Louis!
I love you, sweetheart!

593
01:07:08,061 --> 01:07:10,164
I'm sorry.
Could we stop?

594
01:07:10,814 --> 01:07:11,610
What?

595
01:07:11,657 --> 01:07:13,763
- I'm sorry.
- Please...

596
01:07:13,865 --> 01:07:16,296
Louis, we're going to stop
for a second,

597
01:07:16,358 --> 01:07:18,226
but I'll be right back.

598
01:07:22,011 --> 01:07:22,737
Are you all right?

599
01:07:22,739 --> 01:07:24,233
I'm sorry, I'm just...
I really...

600
01:07:24,235 --> 01:07:25,806
I understand, I understand.

601
01:07:25,808 --> 01:07:27,836
That's exactly how I reacted
the first time.

602
01:07:27,838 --> 01:07:29,334
I have to go. Okay.
I'm... I'm sorry. Thank you.

603
01:07:29,336 --> 01:07:32,106
- No, no. It's okay. It's okay.
- Thank you. Yeah.

604
01:07:39,752 --> 01:07:42,452
I know. I know, honey.

605
01:07:42,529 --> 01:07:44,503
If you want to try this
on your own...

606
01:07:44,561 --> 01:07:47,130
- God...
- It's okay. It's okay.

607
01:07:47,179 --> 01:07:49,265
First light the candle,

608
01:07:49,336 --> 01:07:52,093
then choose an item that
belonged to your daughter.

609
01:07:52,149 --> 01:07:54,952
That will be your link.
Mine was the chalkboard.

610
01:07:55,007 --> 01:07:56,374
That's my link.

611
01:07:56,557 --> 01:07:58,626
It's all right.
It's all right.

612
01:07:58,746 --> 01:08:01,394
It's okay. There you go.

613
01:08:01,396 --> 01:08:02,932
Then when you're ready,

614
01:08:03,289 --> 01:08:05,260
read this out loud,

615
01:08:05,262 --> 01:08:08,193
every syllable,
very carefully.

616
01:08:08,470 --> 01:08:10,822
Sorry, why?
What is it?

617
01:08:10,869 --> 01:08:12,349
I don't know
what language it is.

618
01:08:12,351 --> 01:08:14,539
The medium
had me read it first.

619
01:08:14,613 --> 01:08:16,581
It's to make things start.

620
01:08:16,669 --> 01:08:19,184
But remember,
your whole family...

621
01:08:19,209 --> 01:08:21,921
Every member needs to be
in the house.

622
01:08:21,992 --> 01:08:24,746
Your son, everyone.
Very important.

623
01:08:24,748 --> 01:08:26,471
- Okay.
- Okay?

624
01:08:26,856 --> 01:08:29,027
Deep breath.

625
01:08:29,061 --> 01:08:30,816
You didn't kill her, Annie.

626
01:08:36,312 --> 01:08:37,252
What?

627
01:08:37,936 --> 01:08:39,872
She isn't gone.

628
01:11:26,039 --> 01:11:28,776
Mom?
What are you doing?

629
01:11:33,869 --> 01:11:35,386
What's going on?

630
01:11:36,542 --> 01:11:38,209
You're sleepwalking.

631
01:11:45,008 --> 01:11:48,845
I'm sorry. Is Charlie here?

632
01:11:51,580 --> 01:11:53,577
Why are you scared of me?

633
01:11:57,644 --> 01:11:58,768
What?

634
01:12:02,705 --> 01:12:04,673
I never wanted
to be your mother.

635
01:12:09,536 --> 01:12:10,643
Why?

636
01:12:11,224 --> 01:12:12,893
I was scared.

637
01:12:14,803 --> 01:12:17,972
I didn't feel like a mother.

638
01:12:18,747 --> 01:12:20,463
But she pressured me.

639
01:12:21,326 --> 01:12:22,713
Then why did you have me?

640
01:12:22,762 --> 01:12:25,636
It wasn't my fault.
I tried to stop it.

641
01:12:27,754 --> 01:12:28,988
How?

642
01:12:31,504 --> 01:12:33,529
I tried to have a miscarriage.

643
01:12:36,465 --> 01:12:37,651
How?

644
01:12:38,819 --> 01:12:39,874
However I could.

645
01:12:39,876 --> 01:12:42,984
I did everything they told me
not to do but it didn't work.

646
01:12:43,504 --> 01:12:45,421
I'm happy it didn't work.

647
01:12:45,828 --> 01:12:47,675
You tried to kill me.

648
01:12:47,732 --> 01:12:49,529
No, I did not. I love you!

649
01:12:49,531 --> 01:12:50,739
You tried to kill me!

650
01:12:50,788 --> 01:12:52,592
- I love you!
- Why did you try to kill me?

651
01:12:52,662 --> 01:12:54,164
I didn't!
I was trying to save you!

652
01:12:54,220 --> 01:12:56,266
Why did you try to kill me?

653
01:13:23,047 --> 01:13:24,225
Peter?

654
01:13:26,303 --> 01:13:27,867
Peter, sweetheart? Wake up.

655
01:13:27,869 --> 01:13:30,095
- What?
- It's okay. It's me.

656
01:13:30,142 --> 01:13:32,589
I am so, so sorry
for everything.

657
01:13:32,645 --> 01:13:34,050
- Please, please forgive me.
- It's okay.

658
01:13:34,077 --> 01:13:35,271
I can't stand
the things I said.

659
01:13:35,273 --> 01:13:36,742
It's okay. It's okay.

660
01:13:38,350 --> 01:13:40,702
Can you get up, sweetheart?
We're gonna try something.

661
01:13:40,726 --> 01:13:42,216
I was having a nightmare.

662
01:13:42,255 --> 01:13:43,717
Oh, it's okay.
We can do something.

663
01:13:43,764 --> 01:13:44,582
Do what?

664
01:13:44,584 --> 01:13:46,621
I figured it out.
Come on, come on.

665
01:13:48,882 --> 01:13:52,094
Steven. Baby. Steve, wake up.

666
01:13:53,276 --> 01:13:54,603
- What?
- Come downstairs.

667
01:13:54,667 --> 01:13:55,872
We're gonna try
something together.

668
01:13:55,927 --> 01:13:58,077
Come on, come on.

669
01:14:00,544 --> 01:14:02,031
Steve, come on. Let's go.

670
01:14:16,645 --> 01:14:18,412
- Dad?
- It's okay.

671
01:14:26,394 --> 01:14:27,823
Come on, come on!

672
01:14:34,301 --> 01:14:36,968
Okay. So...

673
01:14:37,091 --> 01:14:39,088
It's freezing in here.

674
01:14:39,117 --> 01:14:40,762
Wait! No, no, no.
What are you doing? Wait!

675
01:14:40,842 --> 01:14:41,819
I'm gonna close the window.

676
01:14:41,821 --> 01:14:43,267
No, no.
We can't change anything.

677
01:14:43,269 --> 01:14:44,769
I don't wanna mess it up.

678
01:14:44,933 --> 01:14:47,182
Everyone needs to sit.
Come sit.

679
01:14:48,014 --> 01:14:49,536
My friend Joan taught me
how to do this.

680
01:14:49,592 --> 01:14:52,228
What friend Joan?

681
01:14:52,472 --> 01:14:53,794
We need our palms on the table

682
01:14:53,796 --> 01:14:55,483
and our fingers to touch.
Please.

683
01:14:55,485 --> 01:14:56,925
What are we doing here, Annie?

684
01:14:56,970 --> 01:14:58,405
Please. You'll see.

685
01:15:00,382 --> 01:15:03,544
Please. Trust me.

686
01:15:06,971 --> 01:15:08,396
All right, fine.

687
01:15:12,166 --> 01:15:14,235
We can do it over here then.

688
01:15:14,863 --> 01:15:17,166
Peter. Okay.

689
01:15:18,376 --> 01:15:20,810
Okay, Steve. Come on.

690
01:15:21,739 --> 01:15:23,585
I need you both
to concentrate.

691
01:15:23,587 --> 01:15:24,478
On what?

692
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:25,465
Think about Charlie,
if you can.

693
01:15:25,467 --> 01:15:27,900
- Oh, for fuck's sake.
- Sweetheart, please, please.

694
01:15:27,902 --> 01:15:28,971
I tried this 20 minutes ago

695
01:15:28,973 --> 01:15:30,374
- and it worked.
- What worked?

696
01:15:30,376 --> 01:15:31,352
I would not be bringing you
down here if it didn't.

697
01:15:31,354 --> 01:15:32,213
Well, I just need to show you.

698
01:15:32,215 --> 01:15:35,898
- Show what?
- Fuck! I'm a...

699
01:15:36,329 --> 01:15:37,502
I'm a medium, okay?

700
01:15:37,504 --> 01:15:38,883
I was
seeing apparitions earlier

701
01:15:38,885 --> 01:15:41,123
and I just shook them off
and I shouldn't have.

702
01:15:41,411 --> 01:15:42,475
Please, I know how it sounds,

703
01:15:42,524 --> 01:15:43,532
but there's no way
to talk about it.

704
01:15:43,570 --> 01:15:45,761
I just need to show you, okay?
Please, you'll see.

705
01:15:45,816 --> 01:15:47,672
- I'm completely lucid.
- Peter, go to bed.

706
01:15:47,726 --> 01:15:49,453
What! No, no, no!
Peter, please!

707
01:15:49,492 --> 01:15:50,454
We need to do this
as a family.

708
01:15:50,456 --> 01:15:53,254
This needs all our energies,
okay? Together.

709
01:15:53,290 --> 01:15:55,728
All right, I'll stay.

710
01:15:55,966 --> 01:15:57,561
Steve. Steve, please.

711
01:15:57,563 --> 01:15:59,892
I really, really need you
to be open to this.

712
01:15:59,894 --> 01:16:02,959
Please, please.
I promise... Both of you.

713
01:16:03,027 --> 01:16:05,917
Please. I need you
to be open. Please.

714
01:16:06,128 --> 01:16:09,776
Come on, Steve.
Come on, come on. I promise.

715
01:16:09,778 --> 01:16:12,872
Okay.

716
01:16:13,424 --> 01:16:15,016
Okay, good.

717
01:16:15,351 --> 01:16:17,389
So, I read that earlier.

718
01:16:17,391 --> 01:16:19,226
I don't think
I need to read that again.

719
01:16:19,892 --> 01:16:21,895
What language is even that?

720
01:16:22,294 --> 01:16:24,744
Try to concentrate.

721
01:16:31,572 --> 01:16:32,695
Charlie?

722
01:16:34,231 --> 01:16:35,840
Charlie, are you here?

723
01:16:43,956 --> 01:16:45,491
Charlie, it's Mommy.

724
01:16:46,546 --> 01:16:48,100
And Daddy and Peter.

725
01:16:55,324 --> 01:16:57,862
Charlie, if you're
in this room with us,

726
01:16:58,074 --> 01:16:59,975
I'm gonna have us all
touch the glass.

727
01:16:59,977 --> 01:17:01,411
Don't add pressure.

728
01:17:02,561 --> 01:17:04,095
Now if you're in here,
Charlie,

729
01:17:04,181 --> 01:17:06,471
I want you to move
the glass for us.

730
01:17:06,540 --> 01:17:07,724
Even if it's just a tiny bit.

731
01:17:07,726 --> 01:17:08,831
- Oh, Jesus Christ, Annie!
- Even if it's just the tiniest

732
01:17:08,833 --> 01:17:10,469
little movement.
Okay, Charlie?

733
01:17:12,775 --> 01:17:13,833
Okay.

734
01:17:14,913 --> 01:17:18,776
Shit. What the hell?

735
01:17:19,650 --> 01:17:21,619
- What?
- You don't feel that?

736
01:17:22,173 --> 01:17:23,113
What? Feel what?

737
01:17:23,115 --> 01:17:27,008
Like, you don't feel
the air flexing?

738
01:17:30,447 --> 01:17:32,514
Wow! Yes!

739
01:17:32,516 --> 01:17:34,886
Thank you, Charlie!
That was so good!

740
01:17:35,150 --> 01:17:38,460
Okay. Now, Charlie,
what I'd like for you to do

741
01:17:38,506 --> 01:17:41,427
is I'd like for you to show
them what you did earlier.

742
01:17:45,803 --> 01:17:47,324
Can you show them what
you just did for me before?

743
01:17:47,345 --> 01:17:49,448
- Mom.
- She's gonna do it.

744
01:17:54,165 --> 01:17:56,251
- That's enough!
- What! No, no, no!

745
01:17:56,253 --> 01:17:58,584
Listen,
when I did this earlier,

746
01:17:58,963 --> 01:18:01,672
this manifested on the page.
I saw it!

747
01:18:01,674 --> 01:18:03,122
- I saw it!
- What is it?

748
01:18:03,124 --> 01:18:04,576
- It's Charlie!
- Annie!

749
01:18:04,578 --> 01:18:05,704
Charlie, did you want to draw
some more?

750
01:18:05,761 --> 01:18:07,807
- You can keep going.
- Stop it! Stop it!

751
01:18:07,838 --> 01:18:10,055
Okay, we need to keep
our fingers touching...

752
01:18:10,057 --> 01:18:11,778
You are scaring him!

753
01:18:11,780 --> 01:18:14,276
No, I am not!
Peter, Peter, listen...

754
01:18:14,278 --> 01:18:15,399
Stop it!

755
01:18:15,401 --> 01:18:17,889
Listen to me.
There is no need to be scared.

756
01:18:17,891 --> 01:18:19,062
This is your sister.

757
01:18:20,343 --> 01:18:21,223
Mom.

758
01:18:24,244 --> 01:18:26,937
Charlie, what's wrong?

759
01:19:07,262 --> 01:19:08,192
Hello?

760
01:19:09,232 --> 01:19:12,628
- Mom?
- Mom? Mom?

761
01:19:12,630 --> 01:19:13,713
I don't like this.

762
01:19:13,715 --> 01:19:15,341
- Dad, I don't like this.
- What's happening?

763
01:19:15,343 --> 01:19:16,716
- Please stop.
- Annie, please, stop this.

764
01:19:16,718 --> 01:19:17,775
- What's going on?
- Please stop this.

765
01:19:17,777 --> 01:19:19,185
- Please.
- Mom!

766
01:19:19,187 --> 01:19:20,741
You're really freaking me out.
Please stop.

767
01:19:20,743 --> 01:19:21,912
What's happening?
Why is everyone scared?

768
01:19:21,914 --> 01:19:23,155
Dad, make it stop.

769
01:19:23,710 --> 01:19:25,060
Why
are you scaring me!

770
01:19:25,109 --> 01:19:27,314
Make it stop! Make it stop!
Make it fucking stop!

771
01:19:27,361 --> 01:19:29,402
- Make it stop!
- Where's Mom!

772
01:19:29,466 --> 01:19:32,447
Stop it!
Stop it now! Please stop!

773
01:19:32,491 --> 01:19:34,494
Mom? Peter?
Peter, I'm scared.

774
01:19:34,543 --> 01:19:36,506
Dad, make it stop!

775
01:19:36,594 --> 01:19:40,356
What the hell?
What are you doing?

776
01:19:49,222 --> 01:19:50,691
What happened?

777
01:20:35,023 --> 01:20:37,530
Our country has had
many ups and downs

778
01:20:37,532 --> 01:20:38,845
economically speaking.

779
01:20:38,847 --> 01:20:40,313
We've talked
about the struggles

780
01:20:40,351 --> 01:20:45,206
during the 1800s
compared to the fall of 1929,

781
01:20:45,469 --> 01:20:48,066
in an era that
become known appropriately

782
01:20:48,121 --> 01:20:49,770
as the Great Depression.

783
01:20:49,772 --> 01:20:53,827
For a decade we suffered
through many, many hardships.

784
01:20:53,875 --> 01:20:58,749
In 1929, Wall Street had been
going so well

785
01:20:58,852 --> 01:21:02,774
that when it finally crashed
because of the Great Boom,

786
01:21:02,837 --> 01:21:07,407
it caused a huge decline
in the economy.

787
01:21:07,513 --> 01:21:11,144
So much so
that it caused food lines.

788
01:21:13,987 --> 01:21:17,296
This is where
the Federal Government has,

789
01:21:17,298 --> 01:21:18,696
or still has...

790
01:21:29,376 --> 01:21:31,620
Uh, uh. Yes, Peter?

791
01:21:31,622 --> 01:21:34,154
Um, I'm sorry.
I have to go to the bathroom.

792
01:21:34,231 --> 01:21:36,804
Um, of course. Take the pass.

793
01:21:40,369 --> 01:21:41,693
As I was saying...

794
01:21:47,330 --> 01:21:48,079
Hello?

795
01:21:48,585 --> 01:21:50,280
<i>Can you guess
who just called me from school</i>

796
01:21:50,325 --> 01:21:52,320
<i>in complete hysterics?</i>

797
01:21:53,287 --> 01:21:55,823
- Charlie?
- <i>What?</i>

798
01:21:57,234 --> 01:21:59,489
Uh, nothing. What happened?

799
01:21:59,491 --> 01:22:00,987
<i>Peter just called me, Annie,</i>

800
01:22:00,989 --> 01:22:03,098
<i>terrified,
crying in the halls,</i>

801
01:22:03,100 --> 01:22:04,204
<i>convinced
he's being threatened</i>

802
01:22:04,206 --> 01:22:06,669
<i>by some vengeful spirit.</i>

803
01:22:06,724 --> 01:22:08,747
Why does he think
he's being threatened?

804
01:22:08,785 --> 01:22:11,792
<i>Listen to me, Annie.
I have a son to protect.</i>

805
01:22:12,269 --> 01:22:12,971
What does that mean?

806
01:22:12,973 --> 01:22:15,276
<i>It means that that's what
I'm worried about right now</i>

807
01:22:15,314 --> 01:22:16,193
<i>and that's how...</i>

808
01:22:16,195 --> 01:22:17,629
Hey, don't talk to me
like this.

809
01:22:17,664 --> 01:22:19,185
He's my son too...

810
01:22:19,521 --> 01:22:20,317
Oh!

811
01:22:31,177 --> 01:22:33,740
Do not hang up on me again.

812
01:22:33,742 --> 01:22:37,074
I am not sleepwalking anymore.
Do you understand?

813
01:23:02,237 --> 01:23:03,258
<i>At the tone,</i>

814
01:23:03,260 --> 01:23:05,393
<i>please record
your voice message.</i>

815
01:23:05,395 --> 01:23:06,866
<i>When you are
finished recording,</i>

816
01:23:06,868 --> 01:23:09,918
<i>you may hang up or press pound
for more options.</i>

817
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:11,771
<i>Annie, hi!</i>

818
01:23:11,773 --> 01:23:14,022
<i>This is Patrick
at the Archer Gallery.</i>

819
01:23:14,024 --> 01:23:17,477
<i>Um, I was just calling
first to see how you're doing,</i>

820
01:23:17,479 --> 01:23:19,158
<i>how your family's doing.</i>

821
01:23:19,160 --> 01:23:20,452
<i>We've all been thinking
about you</i>

822
01:23:20,454 --> 01:23:22,711
<i>and just worrying about you</i>

823
01:23:22,713 --> 01:23:24,808
<i>and hoping you're okay.</i>

824
01:23:24,810 --> 01:23:27,374
<i>You guys have been in our
constant thoughts and prayers.</i>

825
01:23:27,376 --> 01:23:32,668
<i>And then also, uh, we just
wanted to, well, to say first,</i>

826
01:23:32,670 --> 01:23:35,422
<i>if you need us to postpone
the show or push the date,</i>

827
01:23:35,454 --> 01:23:37,310
<i>it's obviously more than okay.</i>

828
01:23:37,545 --> 01:23:41,476
<i>And if not, uh,
we just wanna call and see</i>

829
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:44,784
<i>if we could help
in any way or offer...</i>

830
01:23:56,843 --> 01:23:59,457
Oh, jeez. That smell.

831
01:24:08,950 --> 01:24:11,078
Annie?
What's that smell?

832
01:24:36,551 --> 01:24:38,093
What the fuck happened here?

833
01:24:39,124 --> 01:24:41,414
I didn't feel like
looking at it anymore.

834
01:27:30,097 --> 01:27:31,265
Charlie?

835
01:28:11,394 --> 01:28:13,949
Peter?
Oh my God, Peter!

836
01:28:15,042 --> 01:28:16,464
What's wrong, baby?
What's happening?

837
01:28:16,466 --> 01:28:17,511
What are you doing?

838
01:28:17,513 --> 01:28:18,527
What do you mean?

839
01:28:18,529 --> 01:28:20,195
You were pulling on my head!

840
01:28:20,197 --> 01:28:21,314
What? No I wasn't.
I just came in.

841
01:28:21,371 --> 01:28:23,646
You were screaming.
What happened?

842
01:28:23,716 --> 01:28:24,961
I saw Charlie in the corner

843
01:28:24,963 --> 01:28:26,939
and then you started
trying to pull my head off!

844
01:28:26,941 --> 01:28:28,903
Oh, Peter.
I would never do that to you.

845
01:28:28,905 --> 01:28:30,723
Are you crazy? Please, baby.

846
01:28:32,119 --> 01:28:33,688
What corner
did you see Charlie?

847
01:28:35,401 --> 01:28:36,756
Peter, listen to me.

848
01:28:36,820 --> 01:28:38,942
I don't know what's happening
or what you just saw,

849
01:28:39,005 --> 01:28:40,646
but I am stopping this.

850
01:28:40,708 --> 01:28:42,729
Do not tell Dad
what you just said to me.

851
01:28:42,762 --> 01:28:44,847
Do not, okay?
Because it is not true.

852
01:28:44,849 --> 01:28:45,735
Something is happening

853
01:28:45,737 --> 01:28:46,805
and I'm the only one
who could stop it.

854
01:28:46,807 --> 01:28:48,793
Do you understand?
I'm the only one

855
01:28:48,795 --> 01:28:50,117
who can fix this.

856
01:31:31,970 --> 01:31:33,081
Joan?

857
01:31:37,644 --> 01:31:39,954
Joan, please.
I need to talk to you.

858
01:31:43,555 --> 01:31:46,377
Joan, I really need
to ask you a question.

859
01:31:53,772 --> 01:31:54,974
Joan!

860
01:32:17,713 --> 01:32:19,231
Peter!

861
01:32:24,750 --> 01:32:25,995
Peter!

862
01:32:28,524 --> 01:32:30,479
Peter!

863
01:32:34,295 --> 01:32:36,583
I expel you!

864
01:32:40,384 --> 01:32:42,219
Zantany!

865
01:32:46,989 --> 01:32:48,422
Dagdany!

866
01:32:50,870 --> 01:32:52,679
Aparagon!

867
01:32:55,148 --> 01:32:56,924
Peter!

868
01:32:57,215 --> 01:33:00,349
Get out!

869
01:33:04,647 --> 01:33:06,133
Peter!

870
01:33:36,234 --> 01:33:37,440
Oh, God.

871
01:37:06,490 --> 01:37:09,460
...so everyone
feels justified.

872
01:37:11,103 --> 01:37:14,745
Iphigenia's murder
was commanded by the gods.

873
01:37:45,468 --> 01:37:48,040
So, really,
Agamemnon had no choice...

874
01:38:16,761 --> 01:38:18,095
Peter.

875
01:38:20,054 --> 01:38:21,822
Peter, what's wrong?

876
01:38:24,308 --> 01:38:26,409
Peter, are you all right?

877
01:38:31,918 --> 01:38:34,394
Can he breathe?

878
01:38:34,518 --> 01:38:35,970
Peter,
what are you doing, man?

879
01:39:17,675 --> 01:39:20,241
<i>Call from West High School.</i>

880
01:39:40,447 --> 01:39:41,682
Hello.

881
01:39:42,812 --> 01:39:43,976
Yes, it is.

882
01:40:22,259 --> 01:40:23,977
Oh, thank God.

883
01:40:26,175 --> 01:40:28,683
Wait, what? Oh my God!

884
01:40:28,738 --> 01:40:31,406
What happened?
What happened to him?

885
01:40:31,469 --> 01:40:33,539
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

886
01:40:33,572 --> 01:40:37,267
Oh my God. Oh, no.
Oh, who did that?

887
01:40:37,333 --> 01:40:39,748
He did it, apparently,
to himself.

888
01:40:41,402 --> 01:40:42,974
Smashed his face
into his own desk.

889
01:40:42,976 --> 01:40:45,634
Okay, Steve. Wait, wait.
Wait, Steve. Listen.

890
01:40:45,636 --> 01:40:48,214
Take his feet.
Please, take his feet.

891
01:40:53,766 --> 01:40:56,927
Steve, uh, upstairs...

892
01:40:56,989 --> 01:41:01,104
In the attic when you were
gone, I went up there and I...

893
01:41:01,151 --> 01:41:02,108
I just... I really need you

894
01:41:02,110 --> 01:41:03,945
to go up there
and see what I saw.

895
01:41:05,033 --> 01:41:06,608
There's a body.

896
01:41:07,630 --> 01:41:08,919
Yeah. I mean,
I think it's my mother,

897
01:41:08,921 --> 01:41:10,758
I think, but I can't tell
because the skin's all black

898
01:41:10,760 --> 01:41:13,295
and she's all distended
but the head is gone.

899
01:41:14,724 --> 01:41:17,694
Will you, please? I just need
you to go and see upstairs.

900
01:41:19,452 --> 01:41:22,102
Please, Steve.

901
01:41:33,729 --> 01:41:35,164
And then there's more.

902
01:41:35,816 --> 01:41:38,579
You mean more than your
mother's headless body?

903
01:41:38,668 --> 01:41:40,103
Of course there is.

904
01:42:27,875 --> 01:42:30,104
- Jesus, fuck!
- Okay, there's more.

905
01:42:30,106 --> 01:42:31,846
What the fuck was that?

906
01:42:31,848 --> 01:42:33,191
Why didn't you
call the police?

907
01:42:33,193 --> 01:42:34,836
The police can't help us.

908
01:42:35,422 --> 01:42:36,260
Who the fuck is that up there?

909
01:42:36,262 --> 01:42:38,496
Do you remember Joan,
my friend whose grandson died?

910
01:42:38,498 --> 01:42:41,009
- She took me to her apartment.
- It did look like your mother.

911
01:42:41,068 --> 01:42:42,704
Well, listen. She taught me
how to do the séance.

912
01:42:42,706 --> 01:42:45,197
I didn't even want to, but she
brought her grandson back

913
01:42:45,199 --> 01:42:47,442
and I saw it and felt it just
like you did with Charlie.

914
01:42:47,444 --> 01:42:49,848
Now, look.
This is my mother's album.

915
01:42:49,850 --> 01:42:51,511
Now look here. See this?

916
01:42:51,513 --> 01:42:54,031
See her?
That's her. That's Joan.

917
01:42:54,033 --> 01:42:55,386
She didn't even mention
knowing my mom

918
01:42:55,388 --> 01:42:57,149
and I've never met her before,
but she approached me.

919
01:42:57,151 --> 01:42:58,438
She consoled me.

920
01:42:58,440 --> 01:43:00,647
She told me about this séance,
and she showed me how.

921
01:43:00,649 --> 01:43:01,752
Now look at this.
See this symbol?

922
01:43:01,816 --> 01:43:02,758
On the necklace
my mom gave me.

923
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:04,639
It's her necklace, right?
They're both wearing it,

924
01:43:04,641 --> 01:43:06,789
and they're wearing it
in every photo.

925
01:43:06,791 --> 01:43:08,886
And look at that pattern!
Did you see up there?

926
01:43:08,888 --> 01:43:11,447
This was painted
above the body, right?

927
01:43:11,449 --> 01:43:12,931
In blood!

928
01:43:14,051 --> 01:43:17,991
You dug up the grave.
It was you, wasn't it?

929
01:43:18,069 --> 01:43:18,747
What?

930
01:43:18,749 --> 01:43:19,648
All those nights you were

931
01:43:19,650 --> 01:43:20,949
pretending to go
to the movies.

932
01:43:20,951 --> 01:43:21,991
You're not even listening!

933
01:43:21,993 --> 01:43:23,736
And then the day
the cemetery called, I said,

934
01:43:23,738 --> 01:43:25,948
"Oh, I won't tell her
because she'd be worried."

935
01:43:25,950 --> 01:43:28,256
Oh, God damn it!
Listen to me, Steve!

936
01:43:28,258 --> 01:43:29,775
I know you don't trust me

937
01:43:29,777 --> 01:43:31,670
and there is nothing
I can do about that.

938
01:43:32,437 --> 01:43:34,942
But they put a curse on us
when we brought Charlie back.

939
01:43:34,944 --> 01:43:36,928
We made a pact with something.

940
01:43:36,930 --> 01:43:37,846
Something that is
in this house.

941
01:43:37,877 --> 01:43:39,678
I don't know what it is
but it is after Peter.

942
01:43:39,680 --> 01:43:42,593
I watched these pages fill.

943
01:43:42,595 --> 01:43:45,153
All of them are Peter!

944
01:43:45,564 --> 01:43:47,580
I'm sorry.
I don't know what I did.

945
01:43:47,582 --> 01:43:50,627
I don't know what I did
but Peter is in danger...

946
01:43:51,091 --> 01:43:53,061
And I started it.

947
01:43:53,592 --> 01:43:55,701
Now if we destroy this book,

948
01:43:56,200 --> 01:43:58,014
it will take me too.

949
01:43:59,070 --> 01:44:00,544
I tried to burn it. I tried.

950
01:44:00,546 --> 01:44:02,412
But my arm caught on fire
on its own

951
01:44:02,414 --> 01:44:03,976
as if I was linked to it
because I am linked to it.

952
01:44:03,978 --> 01:44:06,548
I understand this now. Please!

953
01:44:07,028 --> 01:44:09,031
If we don't destroy
this book...

954
01:44:12,093 --> 01:44:13,797
Peter will...

955
01:44:15,250 --> 01:44:17,999
Oh, God. Do you understand?

956
01:44:19,251 --> 01:44:23,555
We have to do this. Please,
please, please, please.

957
01:44:23,632 --> 01:44:25,100
For Peter.

958
01:44:36,363 --> 01:44:38,432
I need you to trust me, Steve.

959
01:44:40,168 --> 01:44:43,112
It needs to be me.
It's my fault.

960
01:44:43,114 --> 01:44:46,733
It's my fault.
I know it's my fault. Please.

961
01:44:46,735 --> 01:44:49,839
Please, I need you
to throw it in the fire.

962
01:44:51,041 --> 01:44:52,380
Please, I just...
I can't do it.

963
01:44:52,382 --> 01:44:54,843
I can't.
I'm just too fucking scared.

964
01:44:54,845 --> 01:44:56,720
But if we don't do it...

965
01:44:56,722 --> 01:44:59,292
If we don't do it,
it's gonna be Peter,

966
01:44:59,348 --> 01:45:02,696
it's gonna be our son.
Okay, I know this. I know so.

967
01:45:02,698 --> 01:45:05,722
Just, please, please,
please, please, please...

968
01:45:10,727 --> 01:45:13,269
Steve, please.
Please understand, baby.

969
01:45:13,271 --> 01:45:17,821
Please, please.
Please throw it in the fire.

970
01:45:26,102 --> 01:45:28,151
Sweetheart, please.

971
01:45:28,418 --> 01:45:30,755
Please take it, take it.
You gotta do it.

972
01:45:30,757 --> 01:45:31,864
You gotta do it.

973
01:45:32,163 --> 01:45:34,154
Okay. Thank you, thank you.

974
01:45:34,224 --> 01:45:38,319
Okay, here. Okay.

975
01:45:38,365 --> 01:45:40,301
Now listen to me.
Listen to me.

976
01:45:47,632 --> 01:45:51,852
Oh! You are
the love of my life.

977
01:45:56,942 --> 01:46:00,563
I love you, Steve.
I love you so, so much.

978
01:46:01,421 --> 01:46:03,938
Oh, God, I love you so much.

979
01:46:04,065 --> 01:46:05,879
And I love Peter so much.

980
01:46:10,168 --> 01:46:11,622
Now please, just...

981
01:46:13,153 --> 01:46:14,955
Please just throw it in.

982
01:46:33,016 --> 01:46:35,205
I'm not gonna do this
with you anymore.

983
01:46:35,961 --> 01:46:38,012
What? No, no, no!

984
01:46:38,068 --> 01:46:40,337
No, no,
it's not helpful for you.

985
01:46:41,051 --> 01:46:43,589
You are sick, Annie.

986
01:46:44,387 --> 01:46:46,109
I need to call the police.

987
01:46:47,121 --> 01:46:48,956
Oh, God!

988
01:47:56,110 --> 01:47:57,178
Mom?

989
01:48:00,977 --> 01:48:02,044
Dad?

990
01:49:39,143 --> 01:49:40,276
Mom?

991
01:49:41,426 --> 01:49:42,260
Dad?

992
01:50:08,577 --> 01:50:09,978
Hello?

993
01:50:57,783 --> 01:50:59,417
Mom?

994
01:53:38,704 --> 01:53:41,288
Stop! Mom, please stop!

995
01:53:41,290 --> 01:53:43,543
Mom, I'm sorry!
Okay, I'm sorry.

996
01:53:47,777 --> 01:53:51,084
Mommy. Mommy, please.
I'm begging you.

997
01:53:51,100 --> 01:53:52,801
I'm begging you to stop.

998
01:54:01,008 --> 01:54:02,148
Mommy?

999
01:55:19,141 --> 01:55:20,948
Just gotta wake up.

1000
01:55:20,950 --> 01:55:23,273
You just gotta wake up.
Come on. You're okay.

1001
01:55:23,275 --> 01:55:26,456
Just wake up. Wake up!
Wake up! Wake up!

1002
02:01:43,196 --> 02:01:47,515
Oh, hey, hey, hey.
It's all right.

1003
02:01:48,056 --> 02:01:49,412
Charlie...

1004
02:01:53,285 --> 02:01:54,821
You're all right now.

1005
02:01:57,695 --> 02:02:01,711
You are Paimon,

1006
02:02:02,756 --> 02:02:05,661
one of the eight kings
of Hell.

1007
02:02:08,427 --> 02:02:11,265
We have looked
to the Northwest

1008
02:02:11,267 --> 02:02:13,178
and called you in.

1009
02:02:14,077 --> 02:02:17,138
We've corrected
your first female body

1010
02:02:17,507 --> 02:02:22,044
and give you now
this healthy male host.

1011
02:02:22,748 --> 02:02:28,351
We reject the Trinity and pray
devoutly to you, great Paimon.

1012
02:02:28,773 --> 02:02:33,036
Give us your knowledge
of all secret things.

1013
02:02:33,411 --> 02:02:38,065
Bring us honor, wealth,
and good familiars.

1014
02:02:38,659 --> 02:02:41,647
Bind all men to our will,

1015
02:02:41,733 --> 02:02:47,735
as we have bound ourselves
for now and ever to yours.

1016
02:02:54,891 --> 02:02:56,627
Hail, Paimon!

1017
02:02:57,380 --> 02:02:59,843
Hail, Paimon!

1018
02:03:00,937 --> 02:03:03,442
Hail, Paimon!

1019
02:03:04,572 --> 02:03:06,773
Hail!
