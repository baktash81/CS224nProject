1
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:54,754
Water's boiling I'll have 
fresh coffee in a minute.

2
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:17,243
Please need to call the police

3
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:20,447
before it's too late.

4
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:22,549
Before it's too 
late for what, Father?

5
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:26,986
Must use your telephone.

6
00:01:26,986 --> 00:01:27,921
Help yourself.

7
00:01:31,324 --> 00:01:35,995
I don't seem to have a...

8
00:01:35,995 --> 00:01:37,464
It's all right, Father.

9
00:01:37,464 --> 00:01:39,065
- It's on me.
- Thank you.

10
00:01:39,065 --> 00:01:40,633
The sheriff's a good 
friend of mine.

11
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:43,036
He'll take care of 
all your troubles.

12
00:01:43,036 --> 00:01:46,973
We need help.

13
00:01:46,973 --> 00:01:48,308
Help.

14
00:01:48,308 --> 00:01:49,109
All of us.

15
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:51,878
Make your call, Father.

16
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:53,480
I'll go fix the coffee.

17
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:31,211
Welcome back to St. Catherine's, Father.

18
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:23,616
Communications Control, please.

19
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:26,819
This is Andrew Boran.

20
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:28,187
Code word equator.

21
00:06:28,187 --> 00:06:29,989
I wanna speak to 
Commander Beckerman.

22
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:34,794
Hello, Commander.

23
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:35,695
Andrew Boran.

24
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:37,997
I've just been deciphering

25
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:40,400
some signals from outer space,

26
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,034
and the patterns are,

27
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:44,904
are, well, consistent,

28
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:49,075
as though they're trying to 
form words or sentences.

29
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,710
Have you picked up anything similar?

30
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,250
No, I wish I could tell you more.

31
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,785
It's just a feeling I have.

32
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:02,688
Okay, thanks anyway.

33
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:09,395
It's 5:30, Professor,

34
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:10,463
and you are a guest of honor

35
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:11,898
at that banquet this evening.

36
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,034
Yeah, thanks, Larry.

37
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:42,882
I knew it.

38
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:43,816
You're not ready.

39
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,053
If you wanna stop by the plant

40
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:48,220
on the way to the banquet,

41
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,188
you'd better hurry.

42
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:43,075
Hmm, what's this?

43
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:48,347
I just thought of something 
better to do.

44
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:51,384
Oh, you had the same thought 
this morning.

45
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:52,551
What's happening to you?

46
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:56,188
Are you complaining?

47
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:58,858
Only that these little attacks

48
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:00,126
didn't start 10 years ago.

49
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,695
You're right.

50
00:11:02,695 --> 00:11:03,729
We're wasting time.

51
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:09,201
Andrew, come on, we'll be late.

52
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:12,004
Well, so we'll miss the food part.

53
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:12,838
Who cares?

54
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:25,017
We could at least go 
back to the bedroom

55
00:11:26,385 --> 00:11:28,154
I'll never make it.

56
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:50,703
What's so important this 
time of night?

57
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,644
This is the first time I've 
been able to detect

58
00:12:58,644 --> 00:13:01,647
the same kind of coded 
message going into space

59
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:03,115
as I've received from space.

60
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:08,287
You understand?

61
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,223
No, not at all.

62
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:38,317
Andrew, what does that mean?

63
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:39,552
I don't know.

64
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,855
Except it's the first 
time I've ever been able

65
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:45,758
to decipher three words 
in our own language.

66
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:47,026
Don't you receive messages

67
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:48,861
from all over the world 
all the time?

68
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:52,865
This message didn't come 
from our world.

69
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:55,868
Andrew, what are you 
talking about?

70
00:13:57,036 --> 00:14:00,339
Hmm, what on Earth are 
you talking about?

71
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:04,743
I'm not talking about 
anything on this Earth.

72
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,615
Well, come on.

73
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:10,516
We'd better go, huh?

74
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,184
We're gonna be late.

75
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:14,687
Andrew?

76
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:15,688
The banquet.

77
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:18,724
Come on.

78
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:20,559
Yeah.

79
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:57,162
I'm so proud of you, Andrew.

80
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:04,403
You know, it really would have 
been a perfect evening,

81
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:07,907
if Collins just hadn't 
told that dumb joke.

82
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,208
What was that joke?

83
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:10,709
Something about a...

84
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:11,977
We're interrupting this program

85
00:15:11,977 --> 00:15:13,646
to bring you a late 
breaking news story.

86
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:14,980
Beijing reports a major

87
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,015
earthquake in Southeast China.

88
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:17,149
- Wait a minute.
- Near the site

89
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:19,084
of last year's devastation.

90
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:20,686
Despite Chinese government claims

91
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:22,454
in the area of earthquake prediction,

92
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:24,123
this latest tragedy has apparently

93
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:25,958
caught them completely off guard.

94
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:28,527
The death toll so far 
has reached 20,000,

95
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:30,696
but may well climb to 10 
times this number

96
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:32,765
when communication is 
finally re-established

97
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:35,734
with the major population 
center of Fuzhou.

98
00:15:35,734 --> 00:15:38,337
President Carter has offered 
official American assistance.

99
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:39,238
That's terrible.

100
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,074
I wonder when it happened.

101
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:44,076
Probably while we were 
at the banquet,

102
00:15:45,577 --> 00:15:47,746
between the time we 
left the plant and now.

103
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:50,783
We heard the news before 
we left home.

104
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,685
There was nothing 
about an earthquake.

105
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,923
Those three words on the monitor,

106
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:00,826
"Large Earth disruption."

107
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:04,897
Really, Andrew, to think that 
there's any connection

108
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:08,267
between your three words and 
and earthquake in China,

109
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:09,835
that's really reaching.

110
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:12,004
Besides, you said that those words

111
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:14,440
didn't come from any 
place on this Earth.

112
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,274
That's right.

113
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:18,043
Well, then where'd they come from?

114
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:21,947
I'm gonna find out.

115
00:16:43,202 --> 00:16:44,036
Andrew!

116
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,918
Oh.

117
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:01,153
Andrew, I want to talk to you.

118
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:02,254
Well, you haven't checked the negative

119
00:17:02,254 --> 00:17:03,856
velocity sector in sometime now.

120
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,758
We got to keep working 
on this thing,

121
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:07,960
and that crystal you had 
installed it's burning up.

122
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,295
Look, I'm on my way there 
right now, Ray, okay?

123
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:11,897
I heard that you've been 
burying yourself

124
00:17:11,897 --> 00:17:12,831
in the computer section.

125
00:17:12,831 --> 00:17:13,899
Well, I'm still picking up

126
00:17:13,899 --> 00:17:15,667
those signals I told you about,

127
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:16,668
and more frequently.

128
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:19,405
Have you heard anything 
from the Pentagon?

129
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:20,572
Yes, I have,

130
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:22,875
but not about your 
request for a separate.

131
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,910
Well, what then?

132
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:26,612
Well, you must have made 
yourself some friends

133
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:28,714
at that banquet last night.

134
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:29,648
What do you mean?

135
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:31,417
The head of public relations

136
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:33,218
just called me from Washington,

137
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:35,721
and they're setting up a 
lecture tour for you.

138
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,356
You're going out in the street.

139
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:39,525
Now, if you'll make yourself 
popular on that tour,

140
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:41,894
you can get practically 
everything, anything you want,

141
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:44,797
and much easier and faster 
than anything I can do for you.

142
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,900
What's the purpose of this tour?

143
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,968
Well, there's been a 
considerable drop off in

144
00:17:49,968 --> 00:17:53,439
the enrollment of the various 
universities theses days.

145
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:55,441
You know, under the kind 
of scientific research

146
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:56,708
that we do here.

147
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:58,477
Everybody wants to study ecology

148
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:00,446
or one of the other earthly subjects.

149
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:02,314
Now you go out on that tour, Andrew,

150
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:03,682
you talk to those kids like you

151
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:05,484
talked to us at the 
banquet last night.

152
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:06,685
You're gonna make yourself

153
00:18:06,685 --> 00:18:07,786
a lot of contacts.

154
00:18:07,786 --> 00:18:08,620
Yes, sir.

155
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:16,295
Tell them how glamorous the 
position really is.

156
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:18,130
Talk to them about 
outer space and all

157
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:21,667
those wonderful flying 
saucers we see every day.

158
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:23,669
Sorry, Ray, get somebody else.

159
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:25,838
You don't seem to understand, Andrew.

160
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:28,006
You really have nothing 
to do with it.

161
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:30,943
Washington is arranging a 
series of lectures for you,

162
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:33,312
and they feel that's 
important that you go.

163
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:34,880
And, frankly, I do too.

164
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,081
So why don't you just finish what

165
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:37,516
you have to do around here today,

166
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:40,152
go home, have yourself 
a drink, relax,

167
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:41,386
spend a pleasant evening.

168
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:44,323
Meanwhile, I'll get in touch

169
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:46,125
with Washington about 
your itinerary.

170
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,827
We'll get together in 
the morning, okay?

171
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:50,295
I'll talk it over with Sylvia.

172
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:51,830
Oh, Sylvia would love to go off

173
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,665
on a trip like this with you!

174
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:08,547
Hi, John.

175
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:09,548
Hi, Andrew.

176
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:10,582
How's the family?

177
00:19:10,582 --> 00:19:11,917
Oh, fine, thanks.

178
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:14,319
Missed you here last Tuesday.

179
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:16,855
Well, I'm involved in another project.

180
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:19,158
I hear.

181
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:35,207
You know, sometimes I get the 
feeling we've gone about

182
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:37,109
as far as we can with 
this experiment.

183
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:39,444
But that other project,

184
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:41,413
that's something else.

185
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:46,852
I got a feeling I'm really on 
to something important,

186
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,556
and nobody else in the 
plant's willing to help.

187
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:52,357
I know.

188
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:39,564
The Senate approved,

189
00:21:39,564 --> 00:21:41,066
and sent to President Carter a bill

190
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:44,236
authorizing 36 billion for 
military procurement.

191
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:45,203
The bill could be compromised

192
00:21:45,203 --> 00:21:46,405
between the House and the Senate

193
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:47,839
in a disagreement over funds

194
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:50,042
for a nuclear aircraft carrier.

195
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:51,877
The House had voted to 
delete the funds,

196
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:53,211
but agreed to a compromise

197
00:21:53,211 --> 00:21:56,148
that authorized 81.6 million

198
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,517
for preliminary work on the carrier.

199
00:21:58,517 --> 00:21:59,785
In California,

200
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:01,920
a four million federal 
drought relief loan,

201
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:05,390
the first under the Emergency 
Drought Act of 1977,

202
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:08,260
was issued to the 
Chowchilla Water District.

203
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,329
State Treasurer, Jesse Unruh,

204
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,230
whose office must approve 
all such loans,

205
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:15,334
said two million of the money 
will be used to dig new wells,

206
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,869
another million for improvement 
of existing wells,

207
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:20,539
and the last million for 
installation of pipe lines.

208
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:23,241
And now, a little about sports.

209
00:22:23,241 --> 00:22:25,811
Iliana Stacey, the 
hotheaded Romanian...

210
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:32,784
You know, the best thing 
about this tour of yours?

211
00:22:32,784 --> 00:22:33,618
What?

212
00:22:34,753 --> 00:22:38,457
Well, your speech only 
takes 45 minutes.

213
00:22:39,591 --> 00:22:41,293
That'll give us a lot 
of time together.

214
00:22:42,494 --> 00:22:44,129
It will be just like 
a second honeymoon.

215
00:22:46,898 --> 00:22:48,934
"Ten standard minutes."

216
00:22:50,235 --> 00:22:53,004
That's what the message 
read, "10 minutes."

217
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:55,006
I don't get it.

218
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:01,513
That's really romantic, Andy,

219
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:03,382
"Ten standard minutes."

220
00:23:06,184 --> 00:23:07,018
Go to sleep.

221
00:23:25,837 --> 00:23:28,540
You're the best we've had 
this season, Professor.

222
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:31,143
You had them spelled bound 
there for 45 minutes.

223
00:23:31,143 --> 00:23:32,644
Well, I had a lot to say,

224
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:35,247
and I'm sincere.

225
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:37,783
This field's very 
important to get into.

226
00:23:37,783 --> 00:23:39,684
Someday, interplanetary communication

227
00:23:39,684 --> 00:23:41,520
is going to be as common as Ma Bell.

228
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,156
Next time I'm gonna sit closer.

229
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:45,657
What's that supposed to mean?

230
00:23:45,657 --> 00:23:47,426
Well, tonight I sat 
way in the back,

231
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:49,861
in case you were really boring 
then I could quickly.

232
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,265
We usually have to get together

233
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:55,867
in the coffee shop 
after every lecture.

234
00:23:55,867 --> 00:23:57,602
Would sure love to have 
you and your wife.

235
00:23:57,602 --> 00:24:00,138
Well, we might be able to stop 
by for a few minutes, Bob.

236
00:24:00,138 --> 00:24:01,206
But if we don't,

237
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:02,474
I wanna thank you for making

238
00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:03,975
everything so pleasant for us.

239
00:24:03,975 --> 00:24:05,977
It's been our pleasure, 
Professor, really.

240
00:24:05,977 --> 00:24:08,246
- Thank you, Bob.
- Yeah, bye-bye.

241
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:20,826
A dangerous flow of lava

242
00:24:20,826 --> 00:24:22,360
from the east side of the crater,

243
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,996
which may pose a threat to 
the citizens of Kinshasa.

244
00:24:26,097 --> 00:24:28,099
A citywide evacuation 
is being planned

245
00:24:28,099 --> 00:24:30,268
should the threat continue to grow.

246
00:24:30,268 --> 00:24:32,704
Scientists also report a 
cloud noxious gas

247
00:24:32,704 --> 00:24:34,973
stretching towards the Angolan border.

248
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:36,174
Ladies and gentlemen,

249
00:24:36,174 --> 00:24:37,576
a bulletin has just been handed me.

250
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:38,944
Kinshasa has been inundated

251
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:41,179
by a massive flow of molten lava.

252
00:24:41,179 --> 00:24:42,981
The casualty figures are not yet in,

253
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:45,450
but said to be in the tens of thousands.

254
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:46,985
This volcanic eruption is accompanied

255
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:48,587
by severe earth tremors through

256
00:24:48,587 --> 00:24:50,388
the entire country of Zaire.

257
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:55,527
Sylvia, what's the exact 
date of my next lecture?

258
00:24:56,928 --> 00:24:59,231
There's some things 
I wanna check out.

259
00:24:59,231 --> 00:25:00,765
All right.

260
00:25:03,768 --> 00:25:04,970
We have until Wednesday.

261
00:25:28,326 --> 00:25:30,529
That volcano erupting in Africa,

262
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:31,763
doesn't it bother you 
that it didn't happen

263
00:25:31,763 --> 00:25:33,932
within the 10 minutes you 
were talking about?

264
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:35,634
I don't know.

265
00:25:36,935 --> 00:25:38,036
Maybe their minutes are measured

266
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:39,571
on a different scale than ours.

267
00:25:43,074 --> 00:25:45,277
Well, we're about to 
come into Wrightwood.

268
00:25:45,277 --> 00:25:46,611
See that circle on the map?

269
00:25:46,611 --> 00:25:47,812
Yeah.

270
00:25:47,812 --> 00:25:50,015
I'll bet there's a 
transmitter right there.

271
00:25:51,449 --> 00:25:52,817
We'll go up to the next 
junction and take a right.

272
00:25:52,817 --> 00:25:53,985
Then go a mile or two.

273
00:25:53,985 --> 00:25:55,120
That should be it.

274
00:25:56,688 --> 00:25:57,789
But I though you said the space

275
00:25:57,789 --> 00:25:59,257
message you received indicated

276
00:25:59,257 --> 00:26:01,593
a 50-mile radius around here.

277
00:26:01,593 --> 00:26:02,594
Yeah, but there were two signals

278
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:04,696
within that 50-mile radius.

279
00:26:04,696 --> 00:26:06,298
The spot we're about to 
come to is definitely where

280
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:08,166
one of the signals originated from.

281
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:34,926
Hello, Sister.

282
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:35,760
Hello.

283
00:27:00,352 --> 00:27:01,820
Hello, Sister.

284
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:05,590
Aren't we blessed with 
such a beautiful afternoon?

285
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:06,725
Yes, we certainly are.

286
00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:08,593
May I offer you this rose?

287
00:27:08,593 --> 00:27:10,595
You know, when I pray 
to St. Catherine,

288
00:27:10,595 --> 00:27:12,697
she always makes sure 
that I have the most

289
00:27:12,697 --> 00:27:15,367
beautiful rose bush in 
the entire garden.

290
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:16,568
Be careful of the thorns.

291
00:27:16,568 --> 00:27:17,402
I will.

292
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:18,403
Thank you very much.

293
00:27:46,431 --> 00:27:47,632
You know, maybe I better send

294
00:27:47,632 --> 00:27:49,367
my instruments back to Woolworth's.

295
00:27:50,802 --> 00:27:52,871
Well, it's not exactly what 
we were looking for,

296
00:27:52,871 --> 00:27:55,473
but it sure is beautiful.

297
00:27:55,473 --> 00:27:56,307
Yeah.

298
00:27:59,944 --> 00:28:01,079
Well, that other spot on the chart's

299
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:02,447
about 40 miles from here.

300
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:47,258
Andrew, we might get in trouble.

301
00:28:47,258 --> 00:28:49,260
Yeah, we might.

302
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,095
Come on.

303
00:29:06,311 --> 00:29:08,480
What is this place?

304
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,881
Looks like a zoo.

305
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:11,850
A zoo for what?

306
00:31:30,255 --> 00:31:31,089
Andrew?

307
00:31:46,604 --> 00:31:47,405
Andrew?

308
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,141
Andrew.

309
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:00,418
Help!

310
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:02,086
Help!

311
00:32:10,962 --> 00:32:12,463
Andrew, Andrew, Andrew!

312
00:32:12,463 --> 00:32:13,298
- What's the matter?
- The door closed!

313
00:32:13,298 --> 00:32:14,132
The door!

314
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:18,169
Listen I was just there.

315
00:32:18,169 --> 00:32:19,437
It's all right.

316
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:21,606
It's all right.

317
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:22,941
I was so scared.

318
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:26,177
Where were you?

319
00:32:27,512 --> 00:32:29,414
I was right in there it's okay.

320
00:32:29,414 --> 00:32:30,682
Okay.

321
00:32:30,682 --> 00:32:31,916
Whew.

322
00:32:31,916 --> 00:32:33,918
It's all right, honey.

323
00:32:35,687 --> 00:32:36,521
It's okay.

324
00:32:38,823 --> 00:32:40,491
It's all right.

325
00:32:40,491 --> 00:32:41,492
Whew.

326
00:32:41,492 --> 00:32:42,327
Come on.

327
00:32:52,837 --> 00:32:53,938
Let's go home.

328
00:32:53,938 --> 00:32:55,206
We don't have to do this.

329
00:32:55,206 --> 00:32:57,442
No, no, no, I'll be all right really.

330
00:32:57,442 --> 00:32:59,911
Just don't leave me again.

331
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:00,812
All right.

332
00:34:07,645 --> 00:34:08,813
All right, both of you.

333
00:34:08,813 --> 00:34:09,747
Put your hands where I can see them

334
00:34:09,747 --> 00:34:11,482
and keep coming down the stairs.

335
00:34:11,482 --> 00:34:12,884
That's it crawl under here.

336
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:14,352
Follow me underneath.

337
00:34:14,352 --> 00:34:15,353
Get under there.

338
00:34:20,825 --> 00:34:21,859
Lean up against the wall.

339
00:34:21,859 --> 00:34:23,061
- Hands high!
- Let's go!

340
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:23,995
Either one of you make 
the slightest move,

341
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:24,962
and I'll kill both of you.

342
00:34:24,962 --> 00:34:27,198
- Will you...
- Shut up!

343
00:34:32,637 --> 00:34:34,806
Spread them out come on!

344
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:45,183
Who sent you.

345
00:34:45,183 --> 00:34:46,150
Nobody sent us.

346
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,485
We came on our own.

347
00:34:47,485 --> 00:34:48,719
Nobody?

348
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,755
We're five miles off the main highway.

349
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,190
It's the dead of night,

350
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,724
and the two of you decided to take

351
00:34:53,724 --> 00:34:55,393
a quiet little walk in the park.

352
00:34:55,393 --> 00:34:56,928
Is that what you're 
trying to tell us?

353
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,396
Maybe you better 
explain who you are,

354
00:34:58,396 --> 00:35:00,731
and what you're doing down here.

355
00:35:00,731 --> 00:35:03,201
I don't think you realize 
the trouble you're in.

356
00:35:04,635 --> 00:35:07,105
There's a good chance you 
may never leave here alive.

357
00:35:15,546 --> 00:35:17,715
So you're Professor Boran?

358
00:35:18,749 --> 00:35:20,184
Who are you?

359
00:35:20,184 --> 00:35:22,253
I'm Commander Joseph Beckerman.

360
00:35:31,996 --> 00:35:33,931
What's so funny?

361
00:35:33,931 --> 00:35:35,266
We talk to each other at least

362
00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:36,968
once a month on the telephone.

363
00:35:38,736 --> 00:35:40,538
Commander, my wife, Sylvia.

364
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:42,273
How do you do?

365
00:35:42,273 --> 00:35:44,709
I still don't understand 
what's going on.

366
00:35:44,709 --> 00:35:46,577
Come with me please, both of you.

367
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:54,085
As you can see,

368
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:55,720
we're in the communications business,

369
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:56,687
just as he is,

370
00:35:56,687 --> 00:35:59,357
except that we're underground,

371
00:35:59,357 --> 00:36:00,858
and the reason for that is simple.

372
00:36:00,858 --> 00:36:03,761
While he's trying to decipher 
messages from outer space,

373
00:36:03,761 --> 00:36:06,764
we're keeping close tabs 
on communications between

374
00:36:06,764 --> 00:36:09,634
Russian space stations 
and points of earth.

375
00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:13,037
You mean those are Russian 
words we're hearing?

376
00:36:13,037 --> 00:36:15,239
They're the only ones besides us

377
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:17,275
that go up there right now.

378
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:18,109
Excuse me.

379
00:36:32,423 --> 00:36:35,026
For the time being, it's an easy job,

380
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:36,994
but think what it'll be 
like in just a few years

381
00:36:36,994 --> 00:36:39,430
when the other countries 
start doing the same things.

382
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:42,366
Sending satellites and 
stations up there,

383
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:44,735
it'll sound like the Tower of Babel,

384
00:36:44,735 --> 00:36:46,737
and that's what we're planning.

385
00:36:47,672 --> 00:36:50,041
Well, now, tell me more, Andy.

386
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:52,944
What in the devil are you 
doing snooping around here?

387
00:36:53,844 --> 00:36:55,313
You could have gotten killed.

388
00:36:56,247 --> 00:36:57,582
Yeah, I believe it.

389
00:36:59,784 --> 00:37:00,918
I wish I could tell you,

390
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:03,387
but I can't.

391
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:10,661
All right.

392
00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:42,960
I know what you're thinking.

393
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,497
Tomorrow we go back to that convent.

394
00:37:46,497 --> 00:37:48,132
We do go back to that convent,

395
00:37:50,134 --> 00:37:51,802
but that's not what I'm thinking.

396
00:38:07,385 --> 00:38:10,221
You remember the other night

397
00:38:10,221 --> 00:38:12,490
I told you to go to sleep?

398
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:14,625
Yes.

399
00:38:16,227 --> 00:38:17,495
I was a fool.

400
00:38:20,164 --> 00:38:21,499
You sure were.

401
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:24,362
Good morning, Sister.

402
00:39:27,231 --> 00:39:29,533
Who's in charge of the convent?

403
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:30,935
Father Pergado.

404
00:39:32,103 --> 00:39:33,571
Come.

405
00:39:33,571 --> 00:39:35,539
He always welcomes strangers.

406
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:11,308
Welcome to St. Catherine's.

407
00:40:11,308 --> 00:40:12,910
I'm a Father Pergado.

408
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,278
We're very happy to 
meet you, Father.

409
00:40:14,278 --> 00:40:16,847
This is my wife, Sylvia, 
and I'm Andrew Boran.

410
00:40:18,048 --> 00:40:19,817
We're sorry to barge 
in on you like this,

411
00:40:19,817 --> 00:40:22,153
but the convent was 
on her way home,

412
00:40:22,153 --> 00:40:26,056
and we wanted to satisfy a curiosity.

413
00:40:26,056 --> 00:40:27,691
Curiosity?

414
00:40:27,691 --> 00:40:28,759
My husband's not talking about

415
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:30,761
a religious curiosity, Father.

416
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:31,929
Well, no, Father.

417
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:34,098
I work in communications,

418
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:36,734
and my monitors keep 
pointing to this area

419
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:38,903
as a center of activity.

420
00:40:38,903 --> 00:40:40,171
I ought to have known better.

421
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:41,705
I should never have 
allowed Sister Theresa

422
00:40:41,705 --> 00:40:44,141
to bring her transistor 
radio in here,

423
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:45,709
but she does love 
the opera so much.

424
00:40:45,709 --> 00:40:47,611
I don't think a transistor
 would give off

425
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:48,913
the kind of the air 
waves I'm talking about.

426
00:40:48,913 --> 00:40:51,749
Then I don't know what 
else it could've been.

427
00:40:51,749 --> 00:40:53,951
Father, do you ever hear any

428
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:56,187
strange noises here in the convent,

429
00:40:56,187 --> 00:40:57,688
or nearby in the forest?

430
00:40:58,622 --> 00:40:59,423
Not really.

431
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:02,293
The occasional animal 
noises, of course,

432
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:05,963
and from time to time a 
gunshot from a hunter.

433
00:41:07,498 --> 00:41:08,332
Nothing else.

434
00:41:08,332 --> 00:41:09,500
It's very quiet here.

435
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,168
Well, look you don't have to say yes

436
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:12,369
to what I'm about to ask,

437
00:41:12,369 --> 00:41:15,606
but this is a power impulse meter,

438
00:41:15,606 --> 00:41:17,608
and I'd like to simply walk around

439
00:41:17,608 --> 00:41:20,177
and check your walls 
and the basement.

440
00:41:20,177 --> 00:41:21,979
Of course, anything 
we can do to help.

441
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:24,882
Sister Patrizia will accompany you.

442
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:29,086
Thank you so much.

443
00:41:29,086 --> 00:41:31,388
Thank you very much.

444
00:43:56,066 --> 00:43:58,035
Did you manage to find what 
you were looking for?

445
00:43:58,035 --> 00:43:59,236
I'm afraid not.

446
00:43:59,236 --> 00:44:00,471
Well, I'm sorry.

447
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:03,207
Our instruments are 
usually quite accurate.

448
00:44:03,207 --> 00:44:05,776
But, then again they're 
just that instruments.

449
00:44:05,776 --> 00:44:07,411
Yes, of course.

450
00:44:07,411 --> 00:44:08,746
Would you care to stay for lunch?

451
00:44:08,746 --> 00:44:09,780
You're more than welcome.

452
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:11,315
Oh, no thank you, Father.

453
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:14,485
We have a long way to go, 
and we'd better get going.

454
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:15,519
Thanks for your help.

455
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:16,920
Not at all.

456
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:17,755
- Goodbye.
- Bye, bye.

457
00:44:17,755 --> 00:44:18,589
Bye.

458
00:44:30,634 --> 00:44:31,502
Andrew?

459
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:33,037
I knew that was you.

460
00:44:33,037 --> 00:44:34,471
What happened?

461
00:44:34,471 --> 00:44:35,839
You didn't get canceled, did you?

462
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:37,541
I wanted to see about those signals.

463
00:44:37,541 --> 00:44:39,810
Let's not get mixed 
up in all that again.

464
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:41,512
I heard that you were doing great.

465
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:44,248
What are you doing back here?

466
00:44:44,248 --> 00:44:46,316
I had a few days before my next lecture.

467
00:44:46,316 --> 00:44:47,551
I wanna check on somethings.

468
00:44:47,551 --> 00:44:48,786
Okay, if you need anything just holler,

469
00:44:48,786 --> 00:44:51,522
but in the meantime you 
get back on the tour.

470
00:44:56,827 --> 00:44:59,229
Good afternoon, Professor.

471
00:44:59,229 --> 00:45:00,164
Oh, hi, Larry.

472
00:45:00,164 --> 00:45:01,131
How are the lectures going?

473
00:45:01,131 --> 00:45:02,132
Oh, fine, fine.

474
00:45:02,966 --> 00:45:03,901
Here.

475
00:45:03,901 --> 00:45:04,968
Here's a copy of my itinerary.

476
00:45:04,968 --> 00:45:06,170
Oh, sure.

477
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:08,105
Now, I'll phone you from time to time.

478
00:45:08,105 --> 00:45:09,807
But if you see anything 
out of the ordinary,

479
00:45:09,807 --> 00:45:11,275
anything at all,

480
00:45:11,275 --> 00:45:12,242
I want to know about it.

481
00:45:12,242 --> 00:45:13,243
Of course.

482
00:46:58,682 --> 00:47:01,385
That message was sent to outer space.

483
00:47:01,385 --> 00:47:02,920
It described you and me.

484
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:04,822
We both know where it came from.

485
00:47:06,623 --> 00:47:07,457
The convent.

486
00:47:11,595 --> 00:47:13,030
Well, what are we gonna do?

487
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:14,431
The only thing we can do.

488
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:19,169
Go it alone.

489
00:48:22,599 --> 00:48:24,234
Hang on!

490
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:25,068
Go!

491
00:50:55,452 --> 00:50:58,755
Have repair's been made to 
the velocity control system?

492
00:50:58,755 --> 00:51:00,457
We did the best we could.

493
00:51:00,457 --> 00:51:02,926
Then some warp speed should be in order.

494
00:51:04,961 --> 00:51:06,863
We shall soon find out.

495
00:51:25,615 --> 00:51:27,918
"Our Father who art in Heaven,

496
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:29,686
"hallowed be thy name.

497
00:51:29,686 --> 00:51:31,221
"Thy kingdom come.

498
00:51:31,221 --> 00:51:33,990
"Thy will be done on Earth 
as it is in Heaven.

499
00:51:35,158 --> 00:51:37,394
"Give us this day our daily bread,

500
00:51:37,394 --> 00:51:39,563
"and forgive us our trespasses

501
00:51:39,563 --> 00:51:42,666
"as we forgive them 
that trespass against us.

502
00:51:43,834 --> 00:51:45,869
"And lead us not into temptation,

503
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:53,376
"but deliver us from evil."

504
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:48,692
We have exhausted all 
the possibilities.

505
00:53:48,692 --> 00:53:50,126
All except two.

506
00:53:52,762 --> 00:53:55,031
I know, we need them now.

507
00:54:25,562 --> 00:54:26,396
My apologies.

508
00:54:27,497 --> 00:54:28,798
For what you just did?

509
00:54:30,033 --> 00:54:32,535
You are an intelligent 
man, Professor,

510
00:54:32,535 --> 00:54:34,938
and soon you will 
understand everything.

511
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:37,874
Look around you.

512
00:54:37,874 --> 00:54:39,643
What do you see here?

513
00:54:42,512 --> 00:54:44,848
A command display complex,

514
00:54:46,149 --> 00:54:48,218
a library computer control center.

515
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:51,488
Obviously, everything in this room

516
00:54:51,488 --> 00:54:55,058
has some connection with 
velocity-time relationships.

517
00:54:55,058 --> 00:54:55,892
Exactly.

518
00:54:57,027 --> 00:54:58,795
Interstellar travel.

519
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:01,364
What happened to the 
nuns who were here before?

520
00:55:01,364 --> 00:55:02,899
You humans are just beginning

521
00:55:02,899 --> 00:55:04,868
to understand cloning.

522
00:55:04,868 --> 00:55:06,670
We mastered it many years ago.

523
00:55:08,004 --> 00:55:09,472
We took on the appearance 
of Father Pergado

524
00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:12,108
and the six nuns in this mission,

525
00:55:12,108 --> 00:55:14,678
because we were forced 
to for our experiments.

526
00:55:14,678 --> 00:55:16,479
You are telling us

527
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:19,749
that you murdered six 
nuns and a priest?

528
00:55:21,284 --> 00:55:22,252
We had no choice.

529
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:26,856
There was a malfunction 
in negative velocity.

530
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:30,894
A space ship?

531
00:55:30,894 --> 00:55:34,397
No, we use international navigation.

532
00:55:35,899 --> 00:55:38,301
We have paid many visits 
to your planet, Professor.

533
00:55:38,301 --> 00:55:40,770
But now, your Earth has become

534
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:42,972
restructured through 
seismic disturbance,

535
00:55:44,441 --> 00:55:47,410
and we cannot return to 
our planet as we did before.

536
00:55:48,745 --> 00:55:50,480
How did you manage then?

537
00:55:51,748 --> 00:55:54,384
We used what you humans would call

538
00:55:54,384 --> 00:55:58,254
a time warp such as that one.

539
00:55:59,456 --> 00:56:00,390
What do you want from us?

540
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:01,591
Your planet has been working

541
00:56:01,591 --> 00:56:04,594
on a speed coordination system.

542
00:56:04,594 --> 00:56:06,596
We know that, Mr. Boran.

543
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:11,534
What we do know is what 
you have achieved.

544
00:56:13,570 --> 00:56:16,973
We've developed an emergency speed.

545
00:56:16,973 --> 00:56:19,109
How many kilometers per hour?

546
00:56:19,109 --> 00:56:20,910
Close to 200 million.

547
00:56:23,613 --> 00:56:25,014
What precisely do you use

548
00:56:25,014 --> 00:56:28,118
to achieve this emergency speed?

549
00:56:28,118 --> 00:56:32,122
A small capsule containing 
zero time reference,

550
00:56:32,122 --> 00:56:33,656
a variance crystal.

551
00:56:33,656 --> 00:56:36,226
That is exactly what we need.

552
00:56:37,093 --> 00:56:39,095
I can't help you.

553
00:56:39,095 --> 00:56:41,197
Well, I'd never get 
it away from the plant.

554
00:56:41,197 --> 00:56:42,832
Well, security's too tight.

555
00:56:42,832 --> 00:56:45,001
Unfortunately, there is no more time.

556
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:50,073
I know that you are 
tired and you need rest,

557
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:53,610
but by the morning 
you will find a way.

558
00:56:55,879 --> 00:56:57,480
You will, Mr. Boran,

559
00:57:00,283 --> 00:57:01,317
or you will lose your wife.

560
00:57:04,454 --> 00:57:05,455
Goodnight.

561
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:46,796
I'm afraid.

562
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:48,498
They're so powerful.

563
00:57:50,166 --> 00:57:51,334
But limited.

564
00:57:53,069 --> 00:57:55,038
They must be prisoners 
of this place,

565
00:57:55,905 --> 00:57:57,607
unable to function away from it.

566
00:57:58,808 --> 00:58:00,710
Otherwise, they'd get 
to crystal themselves.

567
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:05,114
What are they gonna do?

568
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:08,251
We're not waiting 
around to find out.

569
00:58:08,251 --> 00:58:09,619
We're gonna get out of here.

570
00:58:09,619 --> 00:58:10,453
Oh, how?

571
00:58:12,355 --> 00:58:13,990
Well, look at this place.

572
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:15,291
The door's wide open.

573
00:58:15,291 --> 00:58:16,659
There's no one guarding us.

574
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:19,395
When they sleep,

575
00:58:19,395 --> 00:58:21,097
maybe their powers sleep with them.

576
00:58:22,699 --> 00:58:23,533
Now, come on.

577
00:58:24,934 --> 00:58:25,768
Come on.

578
00:58:27,570 --> 00:58:28,404
Come on.

579
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:25,795
They've taken the car.

580
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:12,001
Of course.

581
01:01:13,770 --> 01:01:15,505
They're controlling our every move.

582
01:01:18,174 --> 01:01:20,076
That's why we couldn't escape.

583
01:01:25,782 --> 01:01:28,284
We have to find somebody 
they had no contact with,

584
01:01:30,553 --> 01:01:32,255
a total stranger.

585
01:01:34,090 --> 01:01:35,458
All right.

586
01:02:11,094 --> 01:02:13,096
What the hell is 
wrong with you two?

587
01:02:13,096 --> 01:02:15,098
Look, this is an emergency.

588
01:02:15,098 --> 01:02:17,433
Please, take us to the 
nearest police station.

589
01:02:18,568 --> 01:02:19,669
Please, help us.

590
01:02:29,078 --> 01:02:29,912
Yeah.

591
01:02:29,912 --> 01:02:31,380
Okay, get in, come on.

592
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:43,486
I know.

593
01:03:45,087 --> 01:03:47,356
Welcome to St. Catherine's.

594
01:05:04,166 --> 01:05:06,035
I trust that you slept well.

595
01:05:15,945 --> 01:05:17,747
What kind of a planet 
do you come from

596
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:19,548
that you'd kill to 
get back to it?

597
01:05:21,417 --> 01:05:25,955
We have no deaths there, 
no diseases, no wars.

598
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:28,424
Utopia?

599
01:05:29,425 --> 01:05:30,860
A perfect world, right?

600
01:05:32,161 --> 01:05:32,995
Yes.

601
01:05:34,130 --> 01:05:36,132
That is why we're so 
anxious to return to it,

602
01:05:37,566 --> 01:05:40,903
and that is why you will 
do exactly as we ask.

603
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:45,975
We shall look after your 
wife until you return.

604
01:05:47,843 --> 01:05:51,647
But we want that variance 
crystal and we want it now.

605
01:05:56,085 --> 01:05:57,753
Remember, Mr. Boran,

606
01:05:59,655 --> 01:06:02,425
you will be under our 
protection every moment.

607
01:06:02,425 --> 01:06:04,627
Do you mean the same 
kind of protection

608
01:06:04,627 --> 01:06:07,563
that you used to 
murder Father Pergado,

609
01:06:07,563 --> 01:06:09,832
and that poor driver who 
tried to pick us up?

610
01:06:11,901 --> 01:06:13,102
If it is needed.

611
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:19,275
You will help us.

612
01:06:31,821 --> 01:06:33,356
You've got to promise me,

613
01:06:33,356 --> 01:06:36,058
you won't do anything 
to antagonize them.

614
01:06:36,058 --> 01:06:36,892
I won't.

615
01:06:38,194 --> 01:06:39,695
But what they're asking you to do

616
01:06:39,695 --> 01:06:41,931
is impossible without 
getting someone killed.

617
01:06:43,265 --> 01:06:46,168
What about John Davis 
and the other guards?

618
01:06:46,168 --> 01:06:47,770
If anything happened to them,

619
01:06:47,770 --> 01:06:49,038
I couldn't live with myself.

620
01:06:49,038 --> 01:06:50,740
We're gonna get out of this alive.

621
01:06:52,041 --> 01:06:54,010
I have a way to get in the plant

622
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:56,212
without involving John 
and the other guards.

623
01:06:58,047 --> 01:06:59,015
Be careful, Andy.

624
01:07:01,484 --> 01:07:05,621
What could happen with all 
those nuns to pray for me.

625
01:13:00,676 --> 01:13:01,510
No, stop!

626
01:13:01,510 --> 01:13:02,578
Don't shoot, dammit!

627
01:13:02,578 --> 01:13:04,513
It's Professor Boran!

628
01:13:54,830 --> 01:13:56,665
You have what you want.

629
01:13:56,665 --> 01:13:58,333
Now I want my wife.

630
01:13:59,668 --> 01:14:01,970
I'm afraid that will not be possible.

631
01:14:01,970 --> 01:14:04,106
We had an agreement!

632
01:14:04,106 --> 01:14:06,642
The agreement is expired.

633
01:14:06,642 --> 01:14:07,476
You!

634
01:15:25,721 --> 01:15:27,422
We are going back today, Boran.

635
01:15:27,422 --> 01:15:28,957
Crystal has been installed.

636
01:15:28,957 --> 01:15:32,528
The planet Earth has emitted 
an overabundance of diseases.

637
01:15:32,528 --> 01:15:35,097
They are contaminating the universe.

638
01:15:35,097 --> 01:15:37,866
All the planets light years 
away from here will suffer,

639
01:15:38,867 --> 01:15:40,502
unless it is destroyed.

640
01:15:43,572 --> 01:15:44,940
Destroyed?

641
01:15:44,940 --> 01:15:46,441
We have received our orders.

642
01:15:48,377 --> 01:15:50,712
An earthquake in the 
remote part of China,

643
01:15:51,914 --> 01:15:54,483
the eruption of a long dead volcano.

644
01:15:55,851 --> 01:15:57,085
We stopped when we discovered

645
01:15:57,085 --> 01:15:58,687
that the restructuring of the earth

646
01:15:58,687 --> 01:16:01,924
was preventing us from 
returning to our own planet.

647
01:16:01,924 --> 01:16:04,826
That problem has now been rectified.

648
01:16:04,826 --> 01:16:06,562
Your world will end.

649
01:16:08,297 --> 01:16:09,464
Nothing can prevent it.

650
01:16:13,068 --> 01:16:13,902
This convent

651
01:16:18,006 --> 01:16:19,274
will be the last to go.

652
01:16:23,345 --> 01:16:25,380
I have set the emergency speed at

653
01:16:25,380 --> 01:16:27,616
200 million kilometers per hour,

654
01:16:28,650 --> 01:16:30,752
three times the speed required.

655
01:16:30,752 --> 01:16:32,621
We have a direct path.

656
01:18:21,697 --> 01:18:24,366
You would make an excellent 
citizen of our world, Professor.

657
01:18:24,366 --> 01:18:28,270
I wish that you and your 
wife would come with us.

658
01:18:28,270 --> 01:18:32,007
On Earth, your talents 
are used for destruction.

659
01:18:32,007 --> 01:18:35,010
On our planet, we use them to build.

660
01:20:11,973 --> 01:20:14,409
Tell me it's not happening, Andrew.

661
01:20:14,409 --> 01:20:15,277
It can't be.

662
01:20:18,847 --> 01:20:20,182
It is happening.

663
01:20:21,249 --> 01:20:22,250
It had to happen.

664
01:20:23,451 --> 01:20:25,654
God knows what's on the 
other side of that wall.

665
01:20:30,058 --> 01:20:31,393
It's our only chance.

666
01:20:33,295 --> 01:20:34,196
Let's take it.
