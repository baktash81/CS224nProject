1
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:20,602
The country was big

2
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:22,725
When it was new

3
00:00:22,772 --> 00:00:24,272
The best men was big

4
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:25,975
And their yarns was too

5
00:00:26,067 --> 00:00:27,607
And their tallest tales

6
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:29,494
Folks believed was true

7
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:31,491
So the more they were told

8
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:33,413
The more they grew

9
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,990
Davy, Davy Crockett

10
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:40,368
King of the wild frontier

11
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:43,957
History remembers the name of his gun

12
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:45,502
And some of the deeds

13
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:47,585
He really done

14
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:49,380
But most of his chores

15
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:50,796
For freedom and fun

16
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:52,802
Got turned into legends

17
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,636
And this here is one

18
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:58,471
Davy, Davy Crockett

19
00:00:58,516 --> 00:01:01,806
Helpin' his fame spread wide

20
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:03,305
Had a lotta furs

21
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:05,056
That he aimed to ship

22
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:06,818
And he set his mind

23
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,650
On a river trip

24
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:11,855
When a braggin' boatman
give him some lip

25
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:15,570
A-claimin' there was no man
he couldn't whip

26
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:19,656
Davy, Davy Crockett

27
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:23,624
Tangling with big Mike Fink

28
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:36,602
Them Kentucky ants got a bite
like a alligator.

29
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:38,849
Sure ain't particular what they chaw on.

30
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:46,613
Look at that, would ya?

31
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:48,649
This is the longest hunt
we ever been on.

32
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:51,191
Biggest bunch of pelts
we ever got, too, Georgie.

33
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:52,526
Leastwise, the heaviest.

34
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:55,240
Them packhorses is plum wore out,
and so am I.

35
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:58,198
How much longer you figure
we gotta walk anyhow?

36
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:00,831
I figure we'll reach
the old Ohio pretty soon.

37
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:04,366
Yeah, sure am lookin' forward
to that boat ride.

38
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:09,499
Nothing to do all day but sit in the sun
and fish all the way down to Natchez.

39
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:12,213
That's a mighty good idea
of your'n, Davy.

40
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:14,588
At least we'll get a better price
for our furs there.

41
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:16,296
You ain't foolin' me none.

42
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,716
You ain't thinkin' about the price of furs.

43
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,555
You're thinking about
all that new country

44
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:21,638
we're gonna be lookin' at.

45
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:28,228
Ow!

46
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:38,868
Hey, you, you get away from here.

47
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:40,408
Just ain't your night, is it, Georgie?

48
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:45,082
I'm gonna turn in afore
something else happens.

49
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:58,263
Them fellas sing worse than you.

50
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:02,599
Ain't nothing living
gonna keep me awake tonight.

51
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:13,732
Hey, Davy.

52
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:15,736
- Hey, Davy.
- Now what?

53
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:17,697
There's something in bed with me.

54
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:20,776
Well, kiss it good night and go to sleep.

55
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:02,702
- There's our boat ride.
- Get a move on, Mahalia.

56
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:04,334
It ain't much further.

57
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,763
Listen to the thunder

58
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:21,011
Hear the winds roar

59
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:23,182
Hurricane's a-comin'

60
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,513
Board up the door

61
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:27,676
Load up the cannon

62
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:29,975
Call out the law

63
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:31,689
Worstest calamity

64
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:34,189
That folks ever saw

65
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,574
Girls run and hide

66
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:38,941
Brave men shiver

67
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:41,278
He's Mike Fink

68
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:44,124
King of the river

69
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,740
What's goin' on here anyway?

70
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:48,697
I don't know,
but something sure got their fur riled up.

71
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:50,288
Landin's over there.

72
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:52,213
A real depopulator

73
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,882
Oh, what a deep divin' catfish

74
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:58,338
Well, boys, hope they don't run out
of Monongahela red eye this time!

75
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:03,637
Born too mean to die

76
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:07,057
Oh... Oh!

77
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:14,099
That ought to keep her from drifting.

78
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:22,152
Say, Mister, which one of them fellas
is captain of this boat?

79
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:25,407
What did you say?

80
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,331
He wants to know who the captain is.

81
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:32,584
How long you bushwhackers
been holed up in the backwoods?

82
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:35,539
Everybody knows who the captain
of the Gullywhumper is.

83
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:38,085
It's me, Mike Fink, king of the river.

84
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:40,881
Well, captain,
meet up with Davy Crockett,

85
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:42,343
king of the wild frontier.

86
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:49,766
Davy Crockett, huh?
Well, it sure is a small world.

87
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:52,268
You're about a foot shorter
than you ought to be.

88
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,312
Don't worry, he's still a-growin'.

89
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:56,807
I like them yarns
they keep spreading about him.

90
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:58,729
Mighty hard to live up to sometime.

91
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:01,985
Well, I don't have no trouble
livin' up to mine.

92
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:06,110
I am the original ring-tail roarer
from the thunder and lightning country.

93
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,029
I'm a real snorter and a head-buster.

94
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:10,449
I can out-run, out-jump,
out-sing, out-swim,

95
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:13,326
out-match, out-shoot,
out-eat, outright...

96
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:14,464
Out-talk?

97
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:17,584
Yeah, out-talk, out-cuss and out-fight.

98
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:21,297
Anybody in the whole Mississippi
and Ohio rivers put together.

99
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,591
Mighty interesting,
but all we wanna know

100
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:25,343
is how far down the river you're going.

101
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:27,256
Why, all the way to New Orleans,
of course.

102
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:30,893
Told you I'm Mike Fink, king of the river.
This is my own private river.

103
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:33,893
Well, have you got room
for a couple of private passengers?

104
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:35,346
- Where you bound?
- Natchez.

105
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:37,226
We got some furs
we aim to sell down there.

106
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:40,774
Well, you get a better price
for your furs in New Orleans.

107
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:43,147
Tell you what I'll do,
seeing as how it's you.

108
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:44,784
I'll make you a special rate.

109
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:46,657
Well, that's mighty nice of you.

110
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:49,571
Yes, you and your furs
all the way to Natchez,

111
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:52,409
or New Orleans,
for only a thousand dollars hard money.

112
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:55,794
Why, that's plain uncivilized piracy.

113
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,825
Ain't no question about it.

114
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:01,206
Now, make up your minds
and let me know afore morning.

115
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:02,665
You're keeping me from my drinkin'.

116
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:06,045
A thousand dollars?

117
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:09,182
Who does that big windbag think he is?

118
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,182
Seems like he told us.

119
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:14,522
Well, he might be the king of the river,
but he ain't got the only boat.

120
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:19,977
- Howdy, there.
- Howdy.

121
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:23,018
- This your boat?
- Yep.

122
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:26,359
- Bertha Mae out of Marietta.
- Sounds like a racehorse.

123
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:28,407
Pretty hard to beat if she's handled right.

124
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:30,409
Which way you going?
Upriver or down?

125
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:32,531
Ain't going no place right now.

126
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:34,158
Barrel's marked for New Orleans.

127
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:37,912
That's right.
But my crew up and deserted me.

128
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:40,709
- What'd they do that for?
- Heared about the Injuns.

129
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:43,961
Didn't know there was
any Injun trouble around here.

130
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:46,716
Oh, it ain't here.
Downriver somewhere.

131
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:48,972
Other side of Shawnee town.

132
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:51,091
Them red devils
are attacking everything.

133
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:54,889
Flatboats loaded with settlers.
Even on the keelboats.

134
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:57,234
Got so bad, nobody'd sign on.

135
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:59,438
Don't seem to be scaring off
Mike Fink none.

136
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,060
Him and them
Pittsburgh pole-pushers of his,

137
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:03,896
they ain't human enough to be scared.

138
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:06,692
Looks like we picked
the wrong time for a boat ride.

139
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:08,775
Hey.

140
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,070
Are you really Davy Crockett?

141
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:12,574
Why, sure.

142
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:14,868
I'm Captain Cobb.

143
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:16,241
This is my friend, Georgie Russell.

144
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:17,867
- Glad to know ya.
- Howdy.

145
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:21,254
You fellas got quite a reputation
when it comes to Injun fightin'.

146
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:23,752
Now if folks knew
you were going downriver with me,

147
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:25,424
we could get ourselves a crew.

148
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:26,593
What do you think, Georgie?

149
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:29,171
Beats paying a thousand dollars,
that we ain't got.

150
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:30,428
How many men would it take?

151
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,090
Six, if they're as strong as you be.

152
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:35,256
Well, if they don't know anymore
about boating

153
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:38,096
than Georgie and me,
it'll be some crew.

154
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:42,269
Better split up.
We're gonna cover the town.

155
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,395
Don't you be a-feared
of tootin' your own horn, Davy.

156
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,820
Well, mind what you go promisin'.

157
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,110
Don't want anybody
to think this's gonna be a frolic.

158
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:52,863
That one's about the right size.

159
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,486
See you back at the landing.

160
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:12,014
Ah!

161
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:37,528
- Ah!
- Oh!

162
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:50,507
Now, anybody else don't care
for my cee-gar?

163
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:59,474
Kind of handy with them fists of your'n,
ain't you?

164
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:01,725
I'm better at kicking and bitin'.

165
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:04,189
You're just the kind of fella I been
looking for. Have a drink on me?

166
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:06,898
You're just the kind of fella
I've been looking for, too.

167
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:12,358
Well, here's mud in your eye.

168
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:16,449
Wanna know something?

169
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:20,702
Sleepy little old river town like this
ain't no place for a man of your talents.

170
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:22,995
- Mister, that's a fact.
- Have another?

171
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,869
- Ha.
- What's your name?

172
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:26,707
Jocko.

173
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:30,384
- Mine's Georgie.
- Well, I'm pleased to meet you.

174
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,675
Ah, it's kind of tasty, ain't it?

175
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:47,187
That'd grow pink whiskers...

176
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:49,359
That'd grow pink whiskers
on a hound dog.

177
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:53,688
Hey, Jocko, how do you like to see
a little something of the world?

178
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,319
What you driving at, Georgie?

179
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:56,954
I'm gonna let you in on something.

180
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:59,741
Me and Davy Crockett
is getting up a little party

181
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:01,084
to take a boat ride down the river.

182
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:03,828
- Take a what?
- Boat ride, on the Bertha Mae.

183
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,583
Clean down to New Orleans.

184
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,168
What's so funny?

185
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:11,381
That's the gall-bustingest joke
I ever heard.

186
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,420
Hey, Mike!

187
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:15,417
This clodhopper
is trying to sign old Jocko

188
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:17,256
on the Bertha Mae.

189
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:22,755
You tired of livin'?

190
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:25,177
Nobody tries to steal
one of Mike Fink's crew.

191
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:27,097
Well, how did I know this little hyena...

192
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:28,436
This little squirt...

193
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,111
One of your hyenas?

194
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:34,357
I accept your apology.
Couple of Mike Fink specials.

195
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:40,032
I thought you and Davy Crockett
was a couple of smart fellas.

196
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:43,446
Turnin' me down for a bumblin' old coot
like Cap Cobb.

197
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,950
You heard about them Injuns downriver?

198
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,960
Yeah, but Injuns
don't scare Davy none.

199
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,131
Our only trouble is,
we can't get a crew.

200
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,840
Well, you ain't gonna find
no keelboat men around here.

201
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:57,013
If any of these cornhuskers
are crazy enough to join up with you,

202
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:59,131
you'll end up in a sandbar for sure.

203
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:01,553
Yeah, it's risky, all right,
but we get a free ride.

204
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:04,505
Well, it's your funeral.

205
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:13,571
As we say down in New Orleans,
bon voyage!

206
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:20,698
Hey, down the hatch!

207
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:23,241
Well, I already had a little more
than I'm used to.

208
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:24,905
Oh, come on now, square off.

209
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:28,834
You're gonna be a river man,
you gotta learn how to drink like one.

210
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:47,472
That's funny.
No sign of my friend Russell anywhere.

211
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:48,636
You go look for him, Davy.

212
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:50,394
We'll find the rest of the fellas you need.

213
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:52,098
Yeah, it may take a little persuading,

214
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:54,358
but we'll have a full crew
on the landin' afore morning.

215
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:56,398
Mighty obligin' of you fellas
to join up with me.

216
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:58,194
Well, anything for you, Davy.

217
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:00,738
Well, let's get some men.

218
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:10,459
Yee-haw!

219
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:13,369
Yee-hoo! Ha ha!

220
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,459
Whoo hoo hoo!

221
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:16,714
Yee-hoo!

222
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,546
Hey! Hiya, Davy!

223
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,879
What in thunder got into him?

224
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:24,296
Only a couple of Mike Fink specials.

225
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:26,262
Well, Georgie ain't a drinkin' man.

226
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:28,217
That's what he claimed, but look at him!

227
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:31,137
Hey, Davy! Yee-hoo!

228
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:35,020
Yee-hoo! Ah hoo hoo!

229
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:37,114
Georgie Russel,
quit making a fool out of yourself

230
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:38,571
and get off...

231
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:41,571
Oh, leave him alone, Crockett,
he's enjoying hisself!

232
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:43,736
Ain't had so much fun

233
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:47,913
since I slid down old Smokey
on a barrel stave!

234
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,657
Don't worry, Davy,
we'll beat 'em easy!

235
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:52,498
Beat 'em?

236
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:56,792
What's he talking about? Beat who?

237
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:59,127
Me. Looks like you got a race
on your hands.

238
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:01,883
- Race? What kind of race?
- Well, keelboats, of course!

239
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:03,764
The Gullywhumper
against the Bertha Mae.

240
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,763
- To New Orleans.
- We can't race you.

241
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,965
Well, that's what I told him,
but he wouldn't believe me.

242
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:11,765
Bet your furs against two barrels
of my Monongahela whiskey.

243
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:14,851
He knows better than that.
It took us all winter to get them furs.

244
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:17,767
My crew's gonna look mighty fancy
in coonskin caps.

245
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:21,653
Yee-hoo! Ah-ha!

246
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:22,855
Whoo-hoo-hoo.

247
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:37,038
George, get down from there!

248
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:52,809
Hey!

249
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:55,137
Hey, hey, have a little heart.

250
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:56,685
That's awful wet!

251
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:59,810
If you're gonna be a river man,
you gotta get used to water.

252
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:03,185
I'm awful sorry, Davy.

253
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:05,697
Bein' sorry ain't gonna get us
to New Orleans ahead of Mike Fink.

254
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:07,739
Well, couldn't tell him I was only foolin'?

255
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:09,623
You think he's the kind
to let you off that easy?

256
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:12,698
No, I don't reckon he is.
I'll never do it again, Davy.

257
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:14,366
Well, you better not.

258
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:16,785
Now we really gotta
find ourselves a crew.

259
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:18,212
Well, not in your condition.

260
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:20,712
You get on back to the boat
and have Cap Cobb put you to bed

261
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:22,634
while I gather up the gear.

262
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:29,135
Thank you, Davy.
You're mighty understandin'.

263
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:40,727
Citizens of Maysville,

264
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:44,358
you are about to witness the start
of an historical event,

265
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:48,531
which may well be remembered
as the classic contest of all time,

266
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,534
a keelboat race

267
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:54,084
between the intrepid
Davy Crockett of Tennessee...

268
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:02,633
And the undefeated Mike Fink,
king of the river!

269
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:10,893
Are the captains ready?

270
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:11,968
I'm ready.

271
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:15,719
I guess I'm as ready as I'll ever be.

272
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:18,478
Hey, Crockett, might as well
give me them furs right now.

273
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:20,398
You ain't won 'em yet.

274
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:24,687
Well, if I don't, I'll eat my hat,
red feather and all!

275
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:29,243
One of these days, that big blowhard's
gonna get what's comin' to him.

276
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,571
Take your starting positions.

277
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:33,989
Stand by!

278
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:37,785
Stand by!

279
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,580
No, no, no!

280
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:44,917
Jumpin' catfish! Do like I told ya.

281
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:47,634
Go forward so we can walk back.

282
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:56,063
Now remember,
no one starts until the cannon fires.

283
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:58,734
Get ready.

284
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:00,555
Get ready, boys.

285
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:46,516
Listen to the thunder

286
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:48,977
Hear the winds roar

287
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:51,439
Hurricane's a-comin'

288
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:53,907
Board up the door

289
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:56,409
Load up the cannon

290
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:58,832
Call out the law

291
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,661
Worstest calamity

292
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:03,786
That folks ever saw

293
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:06,132
Girls run and hide

294
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:08,630
Brave men shiver

295
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,840
I'm Mike Fink

296
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:13,593
King of the river!

297
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:15,835
Oh, he's a ring-tail roarer

298
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:18,348
And a tough old alligator

299
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,520
Oh, he's a bull-nosed bully

300
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:23,059
And a real depopulator

301
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:25,143
Oh, what a fightin' devil

302
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:27,897
He'll spit right in your eye

303
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:30,271
He's gonna live forever

304
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,200
Born too mean to

305
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:36,448
Die

306
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:47,541
It ain't no use, Davy.
We ain't gonna catch 'em.

307
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:49,174
We just ain't got
the hang of it.

308
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,001
What we need's a song
like they've got.

309
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:52,706
Well, let's sing one, then.

310
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:56,838
He don't take nothin'
from no man at all, ho!

311
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:58,465
The bigger they brag

312
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,557
The harder they fall, ho!

313
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:03,677
The tougher they are,
the louder they squall

314
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:07,309
When they get wet through
in a free-for-all, ho!

315
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:10,733
Davy, Davy Crockett

316
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,733
King of the wild frontier

317
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,066
Ain't no trick at all

318
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:17,413
To pole a keelboat

319
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:20,907
We can beat Mike Fink
with anything that floats

320
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:24,250
We got the hang
while we feel our oats

321
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:26,078
Look at them clodhoppers,
would ya?

322
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,540
Davy, Davy Crockett

323
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:31,916
Was I snorin' again?

324
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:34,424
On your feet! They're catchin' up!

325
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,260
Don't strain yourselves, boys.

326
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:37,881
They ain't gonna catch us.

327
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:54,114
Wait till they find their selves
going down dead man's shoot!

328
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:57,449
Stand by!

329
00:19:57,529 --> 00:20:00,029
All righty, let's pole!

330
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:02,871
1, 2, 3, 4!

331
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:05,701
1, 2, 3, 4.

332
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:12,634
Much obliged for relievin' me, Davy.

333
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:13,789
How we doin'?

334
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:16,049
We're gainin' on them.
They're just around that bend.

335
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:18,421
Yeah, so's the falls of the Ohio.

336
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:20,677
- Falls?
- That's what they call 'em.

337
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:23,511
Actually, it's a stretch of bad rapids.

338
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:27,177
Used to be real dangerous
till they put in the channel marker.

339
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:36,816
That's funny...

340
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:39,574
River must've cut a new channel
since my last trip.

341
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:51,458
Gentlemen, let's have
a moment of silence

342
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:55,210
for them poor unfortunates
what took the wrong channel.

343
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:05,008
Hey, you stumble-footed idiots!

344
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:07,517
What are you trying to do,
send us to the bottom?

345
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:09,137
Pass them poles!

346
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,189
Hey, cap. It's getting rough.

347
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:13,809
You sure we're in the right channel?

348
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,855
Jumpin' Jehoshaphat!

349
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,360
We're in dead man's shoot!

350
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:21,152
Somebody must've moved the marker!

351
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:28,294
Hey, can't afford to lose you now, cap.

352
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:29,870
Better get below.

353
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,590
Hey, Davy, look out!

354
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:43,255
There's a rock dead ahead.

355
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,931
Pole, you lop headed baboons!
They're beatin' us!

356
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:30,806
Let's pole!

357
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:38,269
Hey, Davy, we're still leadin'.
We might just win this race.

358
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,727
Georgie, don't go skinnin' the bear
till we shoot him.

359
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:42,606
Hey, cap, what's them lights up ahead?

360
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:44,902
Shawnee town. And we better put in.

361
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:47,446
Put in, and let them hyenas
get ahead of us again?

362
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:48,662
Can't be helped.

363
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:51,792
Everything below is soakin' wet,
even our powder.

364
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:54,660
And them Injuns is apt
to jump us anytime now.

365
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:58,633
Hey, Mike, listen.
It sounds like they're puttin' ashore.

366
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:01,170
- Uh-huh. So are we.
- What? You crazy?

367
00:23:01,254 --> 00:23:02,964
Why, now's our chance
to get way ahead!

368
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:05,876
What's the sense of bustin' our backs
when there's an easier way?

369
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:07,637
Here, take over.

370
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:22,191
Pretty late.
Sure hope Davy'll find somethin' open.

371
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:23,395
If they don't take long,

372
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:26,275
maybe we can get started again
afore that Mike Fink shows up.

373
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,030
Ain't no sign of him yet.

374
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:30,155
Hope they don't sneak by us in the dark.

375
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:48,301
- What's that?
- Just an old bullfrog.

376
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:50,553
If that ain't just like a city fella!

377
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:53,559
Don't even know a bullfrog
when he hears one.

378
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:01,274
Little old rascal's getting
pretty close, ain't he?

379
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,900
Oh, the whole riverbank's full of 'em.

380
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:20,922
- What'd you do, Fink?
- Me?

381
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:22,921
- Yeah, what'd you do? What'd you do?
- Nothin'.

382
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:25,213
Seems like a couple bolts
rusted off their rudder

383
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:27,255
when they wasn't looking.

384
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,720
Don't figure it can hang together
too much longer.

385
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:50,739
Hello, there! Come on ashore!

386
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,450
Yoo-hoo, boys.

387
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:54,702
Come on over, boys.
Have a good time!

388
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:58,414
We got liquor
and some fine entertainment.

389
00:24:58,788 --> 00:25:01,078
We're lonesome
for some dancin', men!

390
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:03,076
You won't be sorry!

391
00:25:04,711 --> 00:25:06,051
Well, what do you know?

392
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:08,087
They made that old cave into a tavern.

393
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:10,303
Fetch your poles and hold her, boys.

394
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:11,593
Yoo-hoo, boys!

395
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:14,085
Don't overdo it. They're stoppin'.

396
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:15,764
You Injuns get ready.

397
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:22,438
Ain't you gettin' mighty ambitious,
Mason...

398
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:24,729
Takin' on Mike Fink and his crew?

399
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:27,233
We'll take them as easy
as we did the others.

400
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:35,197
Sure wish we had
some of that cologn-y water.

401
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:38,083
Yeah.

402
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,288
Ah! Mike, look!

403
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:45,456
I'm afraid them sir-eens
is gonna be disappointed.

404
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,554
Oh, ain't that rudder busted yet?

405
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:49,919
That Crockett's got a real gift
for spoilin' my fun.

406
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:51,255
Yeah!

407
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,130
See you gals on the way back!

408
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:54,506
- Yoo-hoo!
- Yoo-hoo!

409
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:55,974
Now to them poles!

410
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,560
Ah, it didn't work, they're going on.

411
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:03,192
They won't get far. Take the horses.

412
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:20,867
Stay in the saddle.
Wanna leave footprints all over?

413
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:35,377
Injuns! Get braced for some fun, boys!

414
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:41,765
This is what we've been waitin' for.

415
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:45,350
Carnation, Davy. Can't we let Mike Fink
try braggin' his way out of this one?

416
00:26:50,358 --> 00:26:51,688
Yee!

417
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:04,829
Keep poling to 'em, boys!

418
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:25,595
Where the devil did that
other boat come from?

419
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:27,225
Don't know, but let's get!

420
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,030
- Anybody get hurt, Mike?
- How could we?

421
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:44,077
You chased 'em off
before we got started.

422
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:48,581
Help, help! Hey, help!

423
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,930
Now what made that bust loose?

424
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:05,563
You fellas are sure having tough luck,
ain't you?

425
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,430
Sorry we can't help you none.

426
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:09,807
Shove off, boys. We got a race to win.

427
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:14,440
That puffed-up polecat
had something to do with this.

428
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:16,066
Wait'll we catch up with him again.

429
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:36,302
They didn't leave nobody
on the Gullywhumper, Davy.

430
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:37,551
Now's our chance to get even.

431
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:39,969
Sure would be easy
to swap rudders, all right.

432
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:43,930
No, we gotta win this race
fair and square.

433
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:46,723
There's a good ship fitter here.

434
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:48,808
I'll wake him up
and get him right to work.

435
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:49,983
How long you figure it'll take?

436
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:52,441
Oh, won't take no time at all
to hang a rudder.

437
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,400
That is, if he's got one already made up.

438
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:55,732
I sure hope he's got one,

439
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:58,357
because Mike ain't gonna wait around
once he knows we're here.

440
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:05,332
Mike seems to be enjoying himself.

441
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:09,708
Maybe you and me can keep him
entertained a while longer.

442
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:11,669
Give us a signal
when you're ready to shove off.

443
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,330
I'll do that.

444
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:19,969
Why, you milk-livered city folk
done been took in by them tall tales

445
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:21,838
about this here Davy Crockett.

446
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:24,336
King of the wild frontier, my eye!

447
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:26,429
There ain't room in this country
but for one king,

448
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:28,854
- and that's me!
- Yes, sir, Mr. Fink.

449
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:31,022
Why, that squash-headed beanpole
of a bear hunter

450
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,690
ain't no match for my shadow.

451
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:33,851
I can beat him at anything you name.

452
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:35,058
Take shooting, for instance.

453
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:38,358
Them paper targets he uses,
ain't no test of a man's nerve.

454
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:44,870
Now, hold still.

455
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:47,529
Hold still.

456
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:53,708
But with a target like that...

457
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:59,630
If a man ain't awful careful,
he could make a mighty serious mistake.

458
00:30:00,381 --> 00:30:01,881
Wait a minute, Mr. Fink.

459
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:04,756
You ain't aimin' to shoot this
off my head?

460
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:07,554
That's good whiskey you're spillin'.

461
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,890
There ain't nothin' to it,
if you'll hold still like this...

462
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:18,071
Like that, Mike?

463
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:39,457
Lucky thing for you fellas
that Mike Fink's got a sense of humor.

464
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:40,746
Come on, belly up!

465
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:46,467
Seems like the proprietor's gone
on a sudden journey

466
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:47,763
and left me in charge.

467
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:49,176
Drinks is on the house!

468
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:53,266
Come on, join us!

469
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:55,271
We'd admire to,
but me and Georgie

470
00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:57,771
don't hold with drinking
when we got a race to win.

471
00:30:58,314 --> 00:31:00,614
Why, I thought you fellas
would be ready to give up by now.

472
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:03,610
You don't know Davy.
He ain't never quit nothin' in all his life.

473
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:06,283
These hillbillies are sure hounds
for punishment, ain't they?

474
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:11,080
Why, we'll be halfway to Natchez
before you get that rudder fixed.

475
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:13,289
Come on, boys, drink up,
and let's shove off!

476
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:20,792
Hey, Mike. I'm surprised at you.

477
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,920
Why?

478
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:25,126
Lettin' that shot of Davy's stand
without no challenge.

479
00:31:25,174 --> 00:31:26,634
Ha ha, you call that a shot?

480
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:28,428
Why, any kid back in Pittsburgh
could do the same

481
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:30,349
if his pa'd let him waste a whiskey.

482
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,010
With the same target
you was gonna use?

483
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:35,228
Yeah. Only I was gonna do it backwards.

484
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,850
- Backwards?
- In the mirror.

485
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:38,896
- Here, I'll show you.
- Oh, no, you don't.

486
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:44,230
You scared, too, Crockett?

487
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:47,319
Lot of difference between
being scared and downright foolish.

488
00:31:47,363 --> 00:31:49,243
All right,
I'll show you a real trick then.

489
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:51,874
- I'll shoot it off my own hat.
- This we gotta see.

490
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:05,915
Back out of the way, everybody!

491
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:25,191
That's tolerable good shootin'
for a river man.

492
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:26,316
Tolerable?

493
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:28,152
I suppose you can do better?

494
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:31,781
I might just try.
Charge up old Betsy for me.

495
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:09,240
I ain't so sure about this.
Better duck your heads.

496
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,050
I just don't believe it.

497
00:33:55,616 --> 00:33:57,196
It is not humanly possible

498
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:59,535
to leap up and catch
a ball in your mouth.

499
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:09,210
Why, you...

500
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:13,134
What's going on around here?

501
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:14,376
Who shot again?

502
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:15,679
Now, fellows, stop fighting!

503
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:19,222
Now, fellows, stop fighting.

504
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:24,436
Aah!

505
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:26,862
I said stop fightin'!

506
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:35,947
I told you to stop fighting!
You guys stop fighting!

507
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:45,787
Hey! Hey!

508
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:48,839
Hey! Come on, get me!

509
00:34:48,961 --> 00:34:50,461
I need some help!

510
00:34:51,714 --> 00:34:54,134
- I wonder what he wants.
- I don't know.

511
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:56,335
Hey, cap, swing into that island.

512
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:15,946
Thank the lord you stopped.

513
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:17,700
You're the first souls I've seen

514
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:20,912
since my flatboat went to pieces
and marooned me here.

515
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:22,743
I near starved to death.

516
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:25,289
We can fix that. Come on aboard.

517
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:26,923
Thank you kindly, son.

518
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:29,209
Mind waitin' till I fetch my livestock?

519
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:31,166
Livestock?

520
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:46,598
Hey! We ain't got time
to load all them animals!

521
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:48,346
Here comes the Gullywhumper!

522
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:52,727
- Cap's right.
- We just can't leave him here.

523
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:55,567
Even if we did get him aboard,
we ain't got room to pole.

524
00:35:55,611 --> 00:35:58,031
Hey, forget about them critters,
grandpa, and get aboard.

525
00:35:58,072 --> 00:35:59,112
We're in a hurry!

526
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,030
I can't leave my stock!

527
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:03,374
It ain't right that he should.

528
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,160
Come on, boys.
Let's give him a hand.

529
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:23,719
Now, ain't that obligin'
of them cornhuskers,

530
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:25,676
waitin' here for us like this?

531
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:31,558
Hey, Crockett, what you doin',

532
00:36:31,647 --> 00:36:34,607
recruitin' a new crew?

533
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:41,315
This ain't no laughin' matter.

534
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:53,789
Oh!

535
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:59,511
What are you belly-aching about?
We're doing all the work.

536
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:04,716
Now I know exactly
how Noah must've felt.

537
00:37:11,145 --> 00:37:13,805
So much obliged
for all the trouble I put you to.

538
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:16,020
That's my place yonder on the bayou.

539
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:17,818
Got time to break bread with us?

540
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:20,532
Admire to,
but we got some time to make up.

541
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:24,566
Excuse me, please.
I got to look after my critters.

542
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:28,830
Well, I sure gotta hand it to you, Davy.

543
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:31,503
You just don't know when you're up.

544
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:33,712
Well, not everybody can come in first.

545
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:37,295
Maybe the good lord
didn't intend for us to win this race.

546
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:41,298
Well, then what are we breaking
our backs for to get to New Orleans?

547
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:43,432
We gotta deliver some furs to Mike Fink.

548
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:48,346
So long, cap.
Sorry your boat's so big.

549
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:50,927
What's the matter with the size?

550
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:52,438
Well, if she was a might smaller,

551
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,860
you could save 40 miles
by takin' this here bayou.

552
00:37:56,899 --> 00:37:59,529
I been down it in my skiff plenty of times.

553
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:03,197
Runs back into the Mississippi
just above New Orleans.

554
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:04,909
Think we got a chance
at gettin' through?

555
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:09,489
Well, it'd be a tight squeeze,
but if you cut a few trees out of the way

556
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:11,327
and don't mind scraping
the bottom a little,

557
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:12,792
you might make it.

558
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:17,169
Georgie,
maybe we ain't lost this race yet.

559
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:15,810
We been practicing long enough.
Now let's show 'em something.

560
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:21,943
Go to them poles,
you scummy river rats!

561
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:31,494
If you don't get me
to that landing afore Crockett,

562
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:33,867
so help me,
I'll turn every mother's son of ya

563
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:35,164
into catfish bait!

564
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:51,007
Push, boys!

565
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:53,773
Push like you never pushed afore!

566
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:00,110
We're beatin' 'em, boys! Push!

567
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:08,783
Moose. Give 'em the Pittsburgh punch!

568
00:40:16,997 --> 00:40:18,497
Aah!

569
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:22,748
So you want to play rough?

570
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:26,966
Ah!

571
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:32,803
- Give it to 'em, Jocko.
- Oh!

572
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:37,595
Give 'em what for, Davy.

573
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:44,023
Use that pole, man!

574
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,690
Hit 'em! Hit 'em!

575
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:18,055
Uh... Uh!

576
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:38,948
Hey! You thought you was
gonna wear our pelts!

577
00:41:39,413 --> 00:41:41,543
You thought we was
gonna be trailin'!

578
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:58,100
What's the world gonna say?

579
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:02,600
Mike Fink, king of the river,
losin' to a pack of landlubbers.

580
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:04,805
I don't reckon we want
anything but our furs.

581
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:06,557
That's all we started out to do.

582
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:10,027
You mean, you ain't gonna
lay claim to my red feather?

583
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:11,950
There's only one king of the river, Mike.

584
00:42:11,987 --> 00:42:13,697
Yeah, that there bayou
we just come through

585
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:15,781
ain't rightly a part of the Mississipp.

586
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:19,539
Where's my hat?

587
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:25,289
They were darn good friends
from that day on

588
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:28,836
Davy sold his furs and then was gone

589
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:32,381
Sailin' north with Mike
to the land of the fawn

590
00:42:32,466 --> 00:42:36,296
Where a man could live
by brain and brawn

591
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:39,969
Davy, Davy Crockett

592
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:42,977
Off for the woods again

593
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:46,900
From the mouth of the river
up to its head

594
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:50,321
Boatmen and travelers
was filled with dread

595
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:54,151
'Cause redskin pirates
was raisin' old Ned

596
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:57,698
And the whole blamed river
was a-runnin' red

597
00:42:58,325 --> 00:43:01,785
Davy, Davy Crockett

598
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:06,669
The man who don't know fear

599
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:09,964
Put your backs into it.

600
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:11,634
What do you think this is, a free trip?

601
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:14,592
Why, you ungrateful polecat, we shoved
and dragged this old tub of yours

602
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:15,965
all the way up from New Orleans.

603
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:20,929
I gotta admit, for a couple backwoods
bear hunters, you ain't done bad.

604
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:23,765
Those are mighty kind words
coming from you, Mike.

605
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:25,941
You can put us ashore
any place along here.

606
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:33,688
I can't see why you
bristle-headed varmints

607
00:43:33,736 --> 00:43:36,356
can't land at a settlement
like civilized passengers.

608
00:43:36,405 --> 00:43:38,195
How do you like that?
He works the tar out of us,

609
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,620
then he calls us "passengers."

610
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:41,200
It's the quickest way to get home.

611
00:43:41,243 --> 00:43:44,413
- Sounds like a mighty long walk to me.
- Who's walkin'?

612
00:43:44,496 --> 00:43:46,826
We're gonna get some horses
and sit down for a change.

613
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:50,714
Now, where are you gonna find horses
in a lonesome place like this?

614
00:43:50,919 --> 00:43:53,959
Chickasaws. This is their country,
and they're real friendly.

615
00:44:11,231 --> 00:44:13,151
Been a real pleasure knowing you, Mike.

616
00:44:13,233 --> 00:44:15,493
I ain't likely to forget you two, neither.

617
00:44:18,864 --> 00:44:21,414
Hey, you forgot your sack!

618
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:23,120
- Oh, that's yours.
- Mine?

619
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:25,449
Just a little something
to remember us by.

620
00:44:25,537 --> 00:44:26,907
Open it up.

621
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:33,795
Well, ain't she a pretty little pop gun?

622
00:44:35,255 --> 00:44:37,835
"To Mike Fink, king of the river,

623
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:42,755
"from his admirers,
Davy Crockett and G. Russel."

624
00:44:43,097 --> 00:44:44,427
Oh, now that we're leavin',

625
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:46,055
we figured you needed
something to protect you

626
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:48,520
against them redskin pirates upriver.

627
00:44:48,602 --> 00:44:50,402
Don't reckon I'll need her for that.

628
00:44:50,437 --> 00:44:51,807
But she'll sure come in mighty handy

629
00:44:51,897 --> 00:44:54,607
for letting tavern keepers
know Mike Fink's a-comin'.

630
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:56,692
There's something else
in that sack for you.

631
00:44:57,736 --> 00:44:59,446
Uhh.

632
00:45:03,283 --> 00:45:05,243
Aw. You shouldn't have done it.

633
00:45:05,285 --> 00:45:08,155
Georgie and me didn't want nobody
thinkin' you still wasn't king.

634
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:11,293
Never was no danger of that.

635
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:15,165
You bushwhackers ever get a hankering
to be river men again, look me up.

636
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:19,585
All right, get back to your poling,
you fork-tailed scorpions!

637
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:23,295
And pull!

638
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:25,684
Put your backs into it!

639
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:28,774
Shove on them poles!

640
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:31,808
What do you think this is,
a pleasure cruise?

641
00:45:32,354 --> 00:45:34,524
We got a cargo to move!

642
00:45:47,536 --> 00:45:48,996
Hey, here's a trail.

643
00:45:49,037 --> 00:45:51,657
Probably lead us right
to a Chickasaw camp.

644
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:09,850
Off through the wood
we're a-marching along

645
00:46:09,975 --> 00:46:12,475
Makin' up yarns and a-singin' a song

646
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:15,943
He's ringy as a bear and twice as strong

647
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:18,573
Thinks he's right
'cause he ain't often wrong

648
00:46:19,067 --> 00:46:21,817
Davy, Davy Crockett

649
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:23,742
Back in the woods again

650
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:28,619
What's the matter?

651
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:31,659
If you'd been listening,
you'd know ain't nothin' but you singin'.

652
00:46:31,705 --> 00:46:33,365
Yeah, that's right. Not a sound.

653
00:46:33,415 --> 00:46:36,495
Not a bird or a squirrel.
Something must've scared 'em.

654
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:39,089
Must be a Chickasaw huntin' party
somewheres nearby.

655
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:41,421
Well, they ain't huntin' us.
Let's find them.

656
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:43,717
I reckon they'll find us,
if we stay on this trail.

657
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:46,679
You quit the caterwaulin'.
No need to scare off their game.

658
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:11,537
Davy, where are ya?

659
00:47:11,703 --> 00:47:14,043
Hey, you darn idiot! Cut me down.

660
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:25,006
So you stepped
in a old deer snare, huh?

661
00:47:25,968 --> 00:47:29,178
It's a good thing Mike Fink can't see
the king of the wild frontier now.

662
00:47:30,556 --> 00:47:32,006
Ow! Ooh!

663
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:48,744
What's the matter with you
crazy Chickasaw? We're friends!

664
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:51,453
You're making a terrible mistake!

665
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:52,575
Don't you understand,

666
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:54,409
it's Davy Crockett
you're trying to hog-tie.

667
00:47:54,454 --> 00:47:56,124
Don't you understand? Davy Crock...

668
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:13,200
Now you know where
they was taking us.

669
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:14,833
Yeah, but what are they
going to do with us?

670
00:49:14,868 --> 00:49:16,788
You've seen red hornet
stirred up before.

671
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:18,540
Shouldn't be too hard to guess.

672
00:49:22,376 --> 00:49:25,036
Mind your manners, Georgie.
This is the chief.

673
00:49:29,716 --> 00:49:32,886
I am told you are the hunter
white men call Davy Crockett.

674
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:34,258
He sure is, chief.

675
00:49:34,346 --> 00:49:36,596
You are known to us
as friend of the red man.

676
00:49:36,723 --> 00:49:39,063
We both are,
and look how you're treating us.

677
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:42,853
You and your friend will not be harmed,
but you will remain prisoner.

678
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:44,855
Why are your men in war paint?

679
00:49:44,898 --> 00:49:47,528
We go to avenge the murder
of our brothers.

680
00:49:47,567 --> 00:49:50,147
This messenger has come
from the chief of the Kaskaskias.

681
00:49:50,445 --> 00:49:52,945
White men have been killing
his people without reason,

682
00:49:53,031 --> 00:49:54,741
hunting them down like animals.

683
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:56,240
Kaskaskias?

684
00:49:56,785 --> 00:49:58,865
They're up on the Ohio
around cave-in rock.

685
00:49:58,912 --> 00:50:00,452
Well, no wonder folks
been shootin' at 'em.

686
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:02,749
They've been attacking every boat
comes down the river.

687
00:50:02,791 --> 00:50:04,001
Do you understand what they say?

688
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:07,094
They are white.
They hear only white man's lies.

689
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:08,920
Now, listen here, you.
This ain't something we heard.

690
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:10,456
We seen it, didn't we, Davy?

691
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:12,379
- Sure did.
- When was this?

692
00:50:12,968 --> 00:50:14,258
Not more than three months ago.

693
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:15,764
Yeah, we helped break up
a raid on a boat

694
00:50:15,804 --> 00:50:18,014
- just below the big cave.
- More lies.

695
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:20,638
Three moons ago
my people were hiding far from the river,

696
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:21,886
driven there by the white men.

697
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:23,597
Then it must have been
some other tribe.

698
00:50:23,645 --> 00:50:26,395
There are no other red men
in the land of the Kaskaskias.

699
00:50:26,648 --> 00:50:29,318
- We have always kept the peace.
- I believe you.

700
00:50:29,901 --> 00:50:31,741
Georgie, you know what this means?

701
00:50:31,778 --> 00:50:34,158
Well, it could mean some white skunks
are dressing up like Indians

702
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:35,819
so these poor devils get the blame.

703
00:50:35,907 --> 00:50:37,827
We're going to find out who they are.

704
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:40,370
You say you know me.

705
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:44,081
Then you know Davy Crockett's
word is good. Turn us loose,

706
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:45,794
and we'll chase those varmints
out into the open.

707
00:50:45,834 --> 00:50:48,794
And if they ain't Indians, we'll see to it
everybody finds out about it.

708
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:50,961
It is too late.

709
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:53,338
Already more messengers
have gone to the Shawnee...

710
00:50:53,425 --> 00:50:56,135
The Miami, the Kickapoo.
And the Chippewa.

711
00:50:56,178 --> 00:50:58,928
Then call them back.
Send out runners of your own.

712
00:50:58,972 --> 00:51:00,772
Tell the chiefs to keep the peace.

713
00:51:00,974 --> 00:51:02,644
Know this, Davy Crockett.

714
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:04,936
We have always wanted peace
with the white man.

715
00:51:04,978 --> 00:51:07,058
But he does not want peace with us.

716
00:51:07,147 --> 00:51:09,227
He makes treaties and calls us brother.

717
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:11,026
But he believes any evil he hears of us.

718
00:51:11,818 --> 00:51:14,448
That's right. But it works two ways.

719
00:51:14,488 --> 00:51:16,988
To strike back
at a few no good murdering whites,

720
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:19,492
you'd turn the whole frontier
into a needless war.

721
00:51:20,827 --> 00:51:22,657
I will send runners.

722
00:51:22,704 --> 00:51:25,004
But we will wait
only until the full of the moon.

723
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:49,443
Sure hope that old Gullywhumper
didn't pass 'fore we got here.

724
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:50,653
They ain't had time.

725
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:53,280
We got a long way ahead of them,
thanks to them Indians.

726
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:56,030
What makes you think
Mike's gonna want to throw in with us?

727
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:58,033
It's his river we aim to clean up, ain't it?

728
00:51:58,115 --> 00:51:59,235
Yeah.

729
00:51:59,324 --> 00:52:01,534
That old chief didn't give us much time.

730
00:52:01,576 --> 00:52:03,696
Won't take long
for that new moon to fatten up.

731
00:52:05,205 --> 00:52:07,995
Leastwise we ain't gonna waste
no more time here.

732
00:52:11,878 --> 00:52:13,418
You know, Davy,
you showed rare good sense

733
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:15,205
in getting old Mike Fink to help you.

734
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:18,218
Don't make no difference
whether them pirates are red or white.

735
00:52:18,301 --> 00:52:20,681
Me and my skull busters'll make
mincemeat of them.

736
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,050
We gotta find 'em first.

737
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:23,927
Well, ain't certain
they'll show their selves

738
00:52:24,015 --> 00:52:26,725
after that whopping I gave them
comin' downriver.

739
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:29,060
They're sure to recognize
the old Gullywhumper.

740
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:31,556
Hey, Mike! Look what's comin'!

741
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:34,783
Why,
that's the Monongahela belle.

742
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:36,570
But where's her crew?

743
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:39,203
Prepare to grab her
as she comes alongside, boys.

744
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:40,529
Aye, aye, captain.

745
00:52:42,951 --> 00:52:46,751
All right, hold onto this mud bank,
you scummy river rats.

746
00:53:05,974 --> 00:53:07,564
I knowed old cap Donovan.

747
00:53:08,101 --> 00:53:10,601
Looks like he put up a real good fight
before they wiped him out.

748
00:53:10,896 --> 00:53:12,056
Yeah.

749
00:53:12,105 --> 00:53:14,765
Thought you said
these pirates wasn't Injuns.

750
00:53:14,816 --> 00:53:17,856
Well, they ain't.
No redskin ever made this arrow.

751
00:53:19,112 --> 00:53:20,702
Let me see that.

752
00:53:22,115 --> 00:53:23,775
Yeah, you're right.

753
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:26,947
Ain't no tribal markings,
ain't feathered right.

754
00:53:27,329 --> 00:53:30,749
I wonder how far downstream
she drifted since the massa-cree.

755
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:32,170
Ain't no way of telling.

756
00:53:44,012 --> 00:53:46,642
Nah, they didn't hardly leave nothing.

757
00:53:46,681 --> 00:53:48,971
Well, they left these.
Try it on for size.

758
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:51,939
Uh-uh! I wouldn't be caught dead
in a monkey suit like that.

759
00:53:51,978 --> 00:53:54,308
Well, it ain't gonna be hard
to disguise the Gullywhumper,

760
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:56,266
but something's
gotta be done about you.

761
00:53:56,316 --> 00:53:57,896
Now, put it on.

762
00:53:58,693 --> 00:54:00,113
Put it on.

763
00:54:16,002 --> 00:54:17,672
Good name for her, Garth.

764
00:54:28,056 --> 00:54:29,596
Hey, Moose.

765
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:33,099
Hide this below where
we can get it in a hurry.

766
00:54:43,029 --> 00:54:45,069
- What's so heavy in that sack?
- Rocks.

767
00:54:45,156 --> 00:54:48,156
Rocks? You featherheaded idiot!

768
00:54:48,535 --> 00:54:51,075
I'll find out what's going on here.

769
00:54:54,082 --> 00:54:56,132
What in thunderation you up to?

770
00:54:56,209 --> 00:54:57,499
You're a banker, ain't you?

771
00:54:57,585 --> 00:54:59,875
Yes, sir. King of the bankers, that's me.

772
00:54:59,921 --> 00:55:03,171
On my way up to Shawnee town
to open a new establishment.

773
00:55:03,216 --> 00:55:05,466
But what's these here rocks
got to do with that?

774
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:07,142
Can't run a bank without money, can ya?

775
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:09,224
No. Don't reckon.

776
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:12,056
That's your capital.
Genuine Spanish gold.

777
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:14,226
Say...

778
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:16,732
We're rich, ain't we?

779
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:18,863
That's what we're hopin'
them pirates will think.

780
00:55:18,898 --> 00:55:22,898
I figure if we stop in a couple of towns,
those folks'll hear about our rich cargo.

781
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:25,236
Word'll get upriver faster than we can.

782
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:34,161
Oh, the river is long
and the moon is high

783
00:55:34,247 --> 00:55:37,117
And I want a gal before I die

784
00:55:37,292 --> 00:55:40,042
Pretty little gal with a turned-up nose

785
00:55:40,086 --> 00:55:42,956
And dancin' music in her twinkling toes

786
00:55:43,757 --> 00:55:45,917
Oh, her cheeks is pink

787
00:55:46,301 --> 00:55:48,591
And her smile is shy

788
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:51,930
And her hair's the color of midnight

789
00:55:52,265 --> 00:55:53,765
Midnight sky

790
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:55,601
Set 'em up again.

791
00:55:55,643 --> 00:55:57,443
Color of midnight, midnight

792
00:55:57,479 --> 00:55:59,479
Midnight sky

793
00:56:13,453 --> 00:56:15,163
That banjo player's got real talent.

794
00:56:15,246 --> 00:56:17,616
Oh, yes.
He hits this town every once in a while.

795
00:56:17,707 --> 00:56:19,207
Plays to drum up business for himself.

796
00:56:19,667 --> 00:56:20,747
Who is he?

797
00:56:20,835 --> 00:56:23,665
A peddler from back East.
He calls himself Colonel Plug.

798
00:56:23,755 --> 00:56:25,875
I sure do admire classical music.

799
00:56:29,135 --> 00:56:30,635
What the devil is in this?

800
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,680
It's just your usual sarsaparilla, sir.

801
00:56:33,807 --> 00:56:35,307
Delicious, ain't it?

802
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:38,480
I don't believe I got your name, stranger.

803
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:40,480
McGillicuddy... J.J. McGillicuddy,

804
00:56:40,522 --> 00:56:42,522
on my way up to Shawnee town
to open up a new bank.

805
00:56:42,607 --> 00:56:45,227
Ah, Mr. McGillicuddy,
I feel it my duty to inform you

806
00:56:45,318 --> 00:56:47,188
that river travel
is not safe anymore here.

807
00:56:47,278 --> 00:56:49,238
Well, if you're referring
to them Injun pirates,

808
00:56:49,322 --> 00:56:51,122
we ain't carrying nothing they'd want.

809
00:56:51,157 --> 00:56:53,117
No guns, no powder.

810
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:55,036
Not even no whiskey.

811
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:57,290
Just a cargo of old Spanish gold.

812
00:56:59,624 --> 00:57:01,174
A cargo of gold?

813
00:57:01,584 --> 00:57:04,134
Well, I'm surprised
that your captain would risk that.

814
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:06,380
Well, you ain't scared any, are you, cap?

815
00:57:06,506 --> 00:57:07,756
Not about the gold.

816
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:09,591
We'll believe them Injuns
when we see 'em.

817
00:57:09,717 --> 00:57:11,217
Those butchers are real, all right.

818
00:57:11,302 --> 00:57:13,182
Wrecks of boats drift by all the time.

819
00:57:13,221 --> 00:57:14,681
What happened to their crews?

820
00:57:14,764 --> 00:57:16,144
Dead men don't talk, pretty much,

821
00:57:16,182 --> 00:57:17,932
but plenty of bodies
are fished out of the river

822
00:57:18,017 --> 00:57:19,097
scalped and chopped to pieces.

823
00:57:19,185 --> 00:57:20,935
No use to try to scare us off, mister.

824
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:23,810
We been hearing them Injun stories
all the way up from New Orleans.

825
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:26,187
Listen, you know who Mike Fink is,
don't you?

826
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:28,784
Who is he?

827
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:31,360
Mike Fink, the keelboat man.

828
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:33,068
Calls himself king of the river.

829
00:57:33,158 --> 00:57:35,948
Oh, that big blowhard.
What about him?

830
00:57:36,494 --> 00:57:38,454
Yeah. What about him?

831
00:57:38,538 --> 00:57:41,368
I've heard that even he's going
to quit the river.

832
00:57:41,416 --> 00:57:43,166
- You heard what?
- Yes, sir.

833
00:57:43,209 --> 00:57:46,839
Even that brained jackass
is too wise to risk it.

834
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,340
Jackass?

835
00:57:53,803 --> 00:57:55,513
Mind your manners, Mr. McGillicuddy.

836
00:57:55,805 --> 00:57:58,845
I'm okay now, boys.
Just one of my seizures.

837
00:57:58,892 --> 00:58:02,232
Excuse me, Mr. McGillicuddy.
I just couldn't help overhearing.

838
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:04,690
But do you really intend
going on upriver?

839
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:07,021
You don't think I'd go this far
if I wasn't, do ya?

840
00:58:07,192 --> 00:58:09,992
Well, now, I admire a man of courage.

841
00:58:10,069 --> 00:58:13,909
Just so happens that I'm mighty anxious
to get on up to Shawnee town myself.

842
00:58:13,948 --> 00:58:15,568
We're pretty crowded already.

843
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:18,038
Oh, shucks, I don't take up much room.

844
00:58:18,077 --> 00:58:20,157
All I got's my sample case and my banjo.

845
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:22,923
A little music wouldn't hurt none,
would it?

846
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:25,079
- This ain't no pleasure cruise.
- Listen.

847
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:26,458
You may be the captain,

848
00:58:26,544 --> 00:58:29,254
but I'm the boss banker
of this outfit, ain't I?

849
00:58:29,547 --> 00:58:31,167
What I say goes.

850
00:58:37,388 --> 00:58:38,808
Did he get aboard this one?

851
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:41,020
Yeah, just went into the cabin.

852
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:44,980
"B-o-n-a-n-z-a."

853
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:48,480
- You ever hear of her?
- You know I can't spell.

854
00:58:50,109 --> 00:58:52,239
Well, hello there, fellas.

855
00:58:52,278 --> 00:58:56,568
Say, I got a new verse
I want to try out on Mr. McGillicuddy.

856
00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:03,497
Something mighty fishy
about that peddler.

857
00:59:03,581 --> 00:59:05,251
Why'd you let Mike bring him aboard?

858
00:59:05,291 --> 00:59:07,961
'Cause he's the first sucker
that nibbled at our bait.

859
00:59:11,589 --> 00:59:13,299
Hello. Nice day.

860
00:59:13,341 --> 00:59:15,381
Mighty pretty, this Ohio river country.

861
00:59:15,468 --> 00:59:17,588
La belle rivière.

862
00:59:17,637 --> 00:59:19,637
That's what the Frenchmen
used to call it.

863
00:59:19,722 --> 00:59:21,012
Parlez-vous français?

864
00:59:21,766 --> 00:59:23,726
- Huh?
- You speak French?

865
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:25,350
Oh, sure.

866
00:59:28,481 --> 00:59:31,401
I've been saving this song
for a time just like this.

867
00:59:32,193 --> 00:59:35,073
There was a widow in New Madrid

868
00:59:35,154 --> 00:59:37,994
A-smokin' a pipe
and a-chawin' on a quid

869
00:59:38,074 --> 00:59:41,034
When she puckered up her lips,
I run for my life

870
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:44,369
But she run me down,
and now she is my wife

871
00:59:44,706 --> 00:59:47,166
Oh, her lips is red

872
00:59:47,333 --> 00:59:50,003
And her eyes is bold

873
00:59:50,086 --> 00:59:52,496
And her hair's the color of yeller

874
00:59:53,089 --> 00:59:55,419
Yeller gold

875
00:59:55,842 --> 00:59:58,722
The color of yeller, yeller

876
00:59:58,803 --> 01:00:01,013
Yeller gold!

877
01:00:01,639 --> 01:00:04,849
The river is long, and the moon is high

878
01:00:05,059 --> 01:00:08,099
I want a gal afore I die

879
01:00:08,187 --> 01:00:11,357
A pretty little gal with a turned-up nose

880
01:00:11,399 --> 01:00:14,779
And dancin' music in her twinkling toes

881
01:00:15,236 --> 01:00:17,986
Oh, her lips is red

882
01:00:18,406 --> 01:00:21,366
And her eyes is bold

883
01:00:21,618 --> 01:00:24,488
Her hair's like yeller, yeller

884
01:00:24,871 --> 01:00:27,291
Yeller gold

885
01:00:28,166 --> 01:00:31,036
The color of yeller, yeller

886
01:00:31,419 --> 01:00:33,919
Yeller gold

887
01:00:53,316 --> 01:00:54,936
Wait a minute! Wait a minute here.

888
01:01:02,241 --> 01:01:05,331
What you doing, Mason?
Smokin' up a new batch?

889
01:01:05,536 --> 01:01:06,826
Won't keep if I don't.

890
01:01:06,913 --> 01:01:08,543
You already got your mattress stuffed.

891
01:01:08,581 --> 01:01:10,291
What you want with more scalps?

892
01:01:10,375 --> 01:01:12,575
Got to keep folks thinkin'
we're Injuns, don't we?

893
01:01:12,627 --> 01:01:14,417
Hey, the Harpes is coming.

894
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:17,464
Did you hear that, Mason?
The Harpes just come in.

895
01:01:18,049 --> 01:01:19,419
Yeah.

896
01:01:30,937 --> 01:01:33,647
- More business for us?
- Yeah, and a fat one this time.

897
01:01:33,731 --> 01:01:36,821
- And the Colonel is aboard.
- Good. What's the cargo?

898
01:01:36,901 --> 01:01:39,361
- Gold.
- Yeller, yeller gold.

899
01:01:39,946 --> 01:01:43,236
Mighty obligin' to ship it our way.

900
01:01:46,869 --> 01:01:49,539
This waiting's making me nervous.
Time's getting short.

901
01:01:49,622 --> 01:01:51,422
That moon was half full last night.

902
01:01:51,457 --> 01:01:53,167
We still got a few days.

903
01:01:53,251 --> 01:01:55,791
Gonna take a few days
to get word back to Chickasaw.

904
01:01:55,837 --> 01:01:57,547
Reckon we ain't got long to wait now.

905
01:02:04,804 --> 01:02:05,894
My boys is all ready...

906
01:02:05,972 --> 01:02:07,762
Chock full of fighting
and itching to get at 'em.

907
01:02:07,807 --> 01:02:10,427
Not so loud.
Don't want Colonel Plug to hear.

908
01:02:10,476 --> 01:02:13,146
- Aw, he's still sleeping.
- Better make sure.

909
01:02:14,147 --> 01:02:17,937
Take over, Mr. McGillicuddy.
This is called a tiller.

910
01:03:09,869 --> 01:03:12,949
This is just about the place
they jumped us afore.

911
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:15,829
Ooh, I've worn
this monkey suit long enough.

912
01:03:37,188 --> 01:03:39,938
Rocks. Just plain rocks.

913
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:55,580
"Mike Fink"?

914
01:03:56,207 --> 01:03:57,867
"Davy Crockett"?

915
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:11,680
Oh... Oh, excuse me, boys.

916
01:04:11,764 --> 01:04:14,644
I was having a little difficulty
getting to sleep.

917
01:04:14,725 --> 01:04:17,305
I thought maybe you fellows
might like to hear a little music.

918
01:04:18,229 --> 01:04:20,439
It's Crockett and Fink

919
01:04:20,481 --> 01:04:21,771
And down in the hold

920
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:23,358
There's a cannon instead

921
01:04:23,442 --> 01:04:26,152
Of yeller, yeller gold

922
01:04:27,363 --> 01:04:29,413
That sounded like Plug.

923
01:04:29,448 --> 01:04:31,528
But what's he singing about this time?

924
01:04:31,617 --> 01:04:34,737
What difference does it make now?
He'll be sculling 'em pretty soon.

925
01:04:43,296 --> 01:04:45,916
You can't do this to me, consarn ya!

926
01:04:47,925 --> 01:04:49,125
Hey, Davy.

927
01:04:49,218 --> 01:04:51,048
Bring up my cannon when you come.

928
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:56,310
If I'd knowed I was gonna have
to tote this thing,

929
01:04:56,392 --> 01:04:58,442
I'd have argued for a pistol.

930
01:05:08,779 --> 01:05:09,989
Hey, Moose.

931
01:05:10,823 --> 01:05:12,493
Come aft and be gunner.

932
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:10,880
What'd you slow her down for?

933
01:06:10,925 --> 01:06:12,625
Close in on 'em. Lay them poles!

934
01:06:12,718 --> 01:06:13,888
What do you think we're doing?

935
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:16,260
Help!

936
01:06:27,733 --> 01:06:28,983
Mike, we're dragging bottom!

937
01:06:29,068 --> 01:06:31,238
Well, it's them confounded rocks
you brought on board!

938
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:32,990
Get 'em outta there!

939
01:06:38,411 --> 01:06:40,081
We're sinking!

940
01:06:41,622 --> 01:06:43,212
Help me!

941
01:06:43,332 --> 01:06:44,922
We're sinking, Mike!

942
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:46,921
Sinking? We're sunk!

943
01:06:47,003 --> 01:06:49,753
Grab your wee-pons, boys,
and let 'em have it!

944
01:07:01,767 --> 01:07:03,937
Dang it, you can't do this to me.

945
01:07:03,978 --> 01:07:07,268
I'll have the law on ya.
I'll have the law on ya!

946
01:07:10,109 --> 01:07:12,029
They're attacking us from the rear!

947
01:07:27,752 --> 01:07:28,842
Get the powder!

948
01:07:31,464 --> 01:07:32,804
Come on, fill her up!

949
01:07:47,980 --> 01:07:49,310
I scalped him!

950
01:08:06,165 --> 01:08:07,665
Aah!

951
01:08:38,656 --> 01:08:39,856
Ah!

952
01:08:58,175 --> 01:08:59,545
Oh!

953
01:09:06,767 --> 01:09:08,057
Oh!

954
01:09:12,189 --> 01:09:13,399
What's holding them up out there?

955
01:09:13,482 --> 01:09:15,112
Them boatmen's putting up
an awful good fight.

956
01:09:15,192 --> 01:09:17,112
We'll fix that.
Get the powder canoe in the water.

957
01:09:34,753 --> 01:09:36,173
Give me a hand.

958
01:09:44,847 --> 01:09:47,017
Hey! I'm on your side.

959
01:10:32,269 --> 01:10:34,099
We got 'em on the run!

960
01:10:34,146 --> 01:10:35,396
No wonder. Look what's coming.

961
01:11:08,180 --> 01:11:10,310
Somebody's playing awful rough.

962
01:11:10,349 --> 01:11:12,559
Why, that's Sam Mason
and the Harpe brothers,

963
01:11:12,643 --> 01:11:14,143
the orneriest skunks on the river.

964
01:11:14,311 --> 01:11:16,901
- Hey, they're getting away!
- Oh, no, they ain't.

965
01:11:17,356 --> 01:11:20,436
You take the rest of them in.
Georgie'll run them varmints down.

966
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:37,040
Boot tracks.
They're the ones we want.

967
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:46,220
Big Harpe, stay here and keep watch.

968
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:47,640
Wait a minute, what about my share?

969
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:49,390
You'll get what's comin' to you.

970
01:12:21,462 --> 01:12:24,632
Leave that big stuff.
We can't carry that on horseback.

971
01:12:34,475 --> 01:12:35,675
That's enough for now.

972
01:12:35,768 --> 01:12:37,558
We can't leave all this
for somebody else.

973
01:12:37,603 --> 01:12:40,193
Nobody's going to find it
till we can get back.

974
01:12:40,272 --> 01:12:42,112
That's what that keg of powder's for.

975
01:13:15,140 --> 01:13:17,140
Somebody's coming up the trail.

976
01:13:17,226 --> 01:13:18,766
Get out of sight.

977
01:13:48,340 --> 01:13:50,720
Cave Inn Tavern
ain't doing much business.

978
01:13:50,801 --> 01:13:53,511
Don't think it ever was a tavern, Georgie.

979
01:13:53,554 --> 01:13:55,474
You mean this is their hangout?

980
01:13:56,014 --> 01:13:57,474
It's gotta be.

981
01:13:57,516 --> 01:13:59,806
Davy! You ain't going in there?

982
01:14:00,060 --> 01:14:02,190
Them varmints went someplace.

983
01:14:20,873 --> 01:14:24,043
This is worse than crawling
in a hollow log after a bear.

984
01:15:05,375 --> 01:15:07,415
Hey, Davy...

985
01:15:09,421 --> 01:15:11,211
Kinda drafty in here.

986
01:15:11,423 --> 01:15:13,673
- Look what I found.
- What was you muttering about?

987
01:15:13,759 --> 01:15:17,049
Looky. Same kind we found
sticking in that wrecked keelboat.

988
01:15:17,471 --> 01:15:19,601
Here's where they changed into Injuns.

989
01:15:22,559 --> 01:15:25,599
Them three that we followed in here
must be the ringleaders.

990
01:15:39,451 --> 01:15:42,251
Stay here, and I'll see
if I can smoke something out.

991
01:16:20,450 --> 01:16:22,580
Hey, Davy, what's keeping you?

992
01:16:26,540 --> 01:16:27,750
There's plenty of loot in there.

993
01:16:27,833 --> 01:16:29,463
Well, they wouldn't go off and leave it.

994
01:16:29,501 --> 01:16:31,211
Reckon they're still around.

995
01:16:53,442 --> 01:16:55,862
This ought to lead
to something mighty interesting.

996
01:17:56,922 --> 01:17:58,262
Oof!

997
01:18:13,730 --> 01:18:15,230
Aah!

998
01:19:04,656 --> 01:19:06,366
Why, you...

999
01:19:07,409 --> 01:19:08,699
Aah!

1000
01:20:01,129 --> 01:20:02,459
Oh!

1001
01:20:09,554 --> 01:20:13,224
Well, here we are splitting up again,
you bushwhackers.

1002
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:17,900
And if we never meet again,
remember, I'm still king of the river.

1003
01:20:18,522 --> 01:20:19,772
Oh, you're better than a king, Mike.

1004
01:20:19,856 --> 01:20:22,226
- You're a first-class friend.
- Yeah?

1005
01:20:22,526 --> 01:20:24,486
Fact, you're the finest
fighting man I know.

1006
01:20:24,611 --> 01:20:27,241
Aw!

1007
01:20:27,864 --> 01:20:28,954
After Davy.

1008
01:20:33,036 --> 01:20:36,456
All right, ring-tail scorpions!
Start pulling!

1009
01:20:36,540 --> 01:20:39,750
Kept his promise to Mike and his crew

1010
01:20:39,835 --> 01:20:42,585
Kept his promise to the Injun chiefs too

1011
01:20:43,088 --> 01:20:46,628
For the river was clear
all the way through

1012
01:20:46,716 --> 01:20:50,256
And blaming the Injuns
was a-proven untrue

1013
01:20:50,303 --> 01:20:53,933
Davy, Davy Crockett

1014
01:20:53,974 --> 01:20:57,734
King of the wild frontier
