1
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:38,371
Come on, you lazy Cro-Magnon!

2
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:39,831
Ohh!

3
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:47,422
Hey! Back to work!
You guys had a break two days ago!

4
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:50,216
Come on, now!

5
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,806
Come on, Sheba!

6
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,975
That's my big girl!

7
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:04,481
Look at those pathetic worms...

8
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,317
burrowing their lives away.

9
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:11,071
Do you know why I'm up here
and they're down there, Miss Stone?

10
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,531
Because you lied on your resume?

11
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,325
No.

12
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:18,078
Because I have vision.

13
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:21,081
And right now I have a vision
of you and me...

14
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:24,417
dripping with coconut oil
on a beach in Rocapulco...

15
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:28,088
with Mr. Slate's fortune
to keep us company.

16
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:33,343
I'm glad we see eye to eye.

17
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:41,851
And somewhere down there
is the ignorant stooge...

18
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:44,896
who will make
all my schemes come true.

19
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,033
Yabba-dabba-doo!

20
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,619
Flintstones
Meet the Flintstones

21
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,622
They're a modern Stone Age family

22
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:06,751
From the town of Bedrock

23
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,754
They're a page
right out of history

24
00:02:12,757 --> 00:02:15,135
Let's ride with the family
down the street

25
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,929
Through the courtesy
of Fred's two feet

26
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,640
When you're
with the Flintstones

27
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,643
Have a yabba-dabba doo time
A dabba-doo time

28
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,312
We'll have a gay old time

29
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:42,996
The captain has just turned
on the seat belt sign...

30
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:46,166
signalling our descent
into the Bedrock area.

31
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:50,628
On your left, you'll be able to see the
Grand Canyon in about 15,000,000 years.

32
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,232
K-A-V-E
Radio Bedrock

33
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:15,695
The KAVE accu-forecast for tonight
calls for light seismic activity...

34
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:18,198
and a 20 percent chance
of meteor showers.

35
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:22,577
Quick traffic update: Due to lava flows,
Highway 1 will be closed... forever!

36
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,704
K-A-V-E
Molten Oldie

37
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:31,711
Sow belly, pot of beans
Tie a rope around your jeans

38
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:34,714
Tell your mom not to wait
You ain't coming home too late

39
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:37,717
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

40
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,094
Twitch

41
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:46,309
There's a town I know
where the hipsters go called Bedrock

42
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,228
Twitch, twitch

43
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,730
When you get that itch
you can do the Twitch

44
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,941
In Bedrock
Twitch, twitch

45
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:56,820
'Cause the Twitch is fine
Have yourself a time

46
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:59,072
- In Bedrock
- Drum solo!

47
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:06,746
Watch it, will ya?
Finally got my hair the way I like it.

48
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:09,749
I'm so excited, Fred.
l'm gonna be a father.

49
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,252
It's like a dream come true.

50
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:15,588
A son. Someone to carry on
the proud name of Rubble.

51
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:20,385
- Think I'll be a good daddy?
- Well, you're bound to find
something you're good at.

52
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,220
Yeah, sure.. Hey!

53
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,892
- Uncle!
- Heh heh heh.

54
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:32,272
You know, Fred, Betty and I
really owe it all to you.

55
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:35,775
We would've never qualified to adopt had
it not been for the money you gave us.

56
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:38,278
Remember, Barn, that's
between you and me.

57
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:42,699
- I'd like to tell the world what
a great guy my best buddy is!
- No, no, no!

58
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:47,287
True, it was a selfless, noble act,
if I do say so myself.

59
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,789
My only reward
will be your happiness.

60
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:52,792
I don't need to go blabbin'
my good deeds all around.

61
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:55,628
You're afraid to tell Wilma,
aren't you?

62
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:02,802
Afraid? Now, let's get
this straight, Rubble.

63
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:06,306
I don't need permission
from my wife to make a decision.

64
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,641
In my cave,
I reign supreme!

65
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,810
Su-preme!

66
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:14,647
- I won't tell her, Fred.
- Thanks, pal.

67
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,475
Hiya, Timmy!

68
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,853
Here you go!
Shoot, shoot, shoot!

69
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,522
Hey, Charlie!

70
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,667
- Huh?
- Wilma!

71
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:17,877
I'm home!

72
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:24,551
No, Dino! No, no!
No, Dino! Bad boy!

73
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,847
Bad dog!

74
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,892
- Good doggie!
- Bad Dino breath.

75
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,227
Fred!

76
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:37,897
Do you have to get Dino so wound up
when you come home?

77
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:41,401
It's not my fault. Maybe he'd
calm down if we had him fixed!

78
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:42,736
What?

79
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:51,369
Here comes
the big Daddysaurus!

80
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,502
How was your day, dear?

81
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,922
I think my Brontocrane's
pregnant again.

82
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,466
I tell ya,

83
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:08,428
you forget to lock her up
one Saturday night..

84
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,972
- Comfortable, Fred?
- On my way.

85
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:15,935
All I need's a brew and a good scratch.
Which one do you want to do first?

86
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:18,938
It does my heart good
to see you relaxing...

87
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,940
after a hard day
at the quarry.

88
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:24,194
I'm telling you, I married
the pick of the litter.

89
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:29,074
Fred, our garbage disposal
has been acting up a lot lately,

90
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,577
so I decided that it was
time to buy a new one.

91
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:36,498
But when I went to take money
out of our savings account,

92
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:39,668
- guess what?
- New garbage disposal?

93
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:43,546
New garbage disposal?
Why throw good money down the drain?

94
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,966
There's nothing wrong
with this one.

95
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:49,260
All right, you. Say "ahh".

96
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:50,845
Uh-uh.

97
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:59,479
Do you have any idea why there's
no money in our savings account?

98
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:00,772
Aha!

99
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,485
There's your problem right there.

100
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,827
All right, you!
Spit it out!

101
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:17,122
Where's the money, Fred?

102
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:20,959
Something happened to it.
There, I said it.

103
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:23,920
We have scrimped and saved
for that money.

104
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:28,466
And every time we get ahead, you have to
go blow it on some harebrained scheme!

105
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,480
I gave it to Barney.

106
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:45,650
- You what?
- I know I should've consulted you,

107
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:48,528
but Barney Rubble's my neighbor,
my lodge brother...

108
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,531
and my best friend since the first
time I went through the fifth grade!

109
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,324
Fred Flintstone!

110
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:57,537
Wilma, without that money, they
wouldn't be allowed to adopt a baby.

111
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:00,498
So go ahead, yell, scream,
let the fur fly.

112
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,501
Give the neighbors
something to talk about!

113
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:10,467
What you have just done
for the Rubbles...

114
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:18,141
And I adore you for it.

115
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,356
Mmm.

116
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:27,609
I also bought
a new bowling ball.

117
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,576
Wait! Come on, honey!

118
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,995
- Watch your step.
- Sit down.

119
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,999
All right, all together, folks.

120
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:54,094
Betty, sit down and relax.

121
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:56,721
Oh, I can't, Wilma.
lt just hit me.

122
00:09:57,097 --> 00:10:00,100
From now on,
I'll be spending 24 hours a day...

123
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,478
attending to the every need
of a helpless little boy.

124
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:11,361
Then again, maybe it won't be such
a big adjustment after all.

125
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:15,448
Fred!

126
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:21,121
And promise me you won't
say anything like you did
when you saw my sister's baby.

127
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:24,874
The kid had a tail. Was I supposed
to pretend I didn't notice?

128
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:29,421
Hello, Mommy and Daddy!
I have someone who wants to meet you!

129
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:33,508
Aah!

130
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:38,847
Well, it's not exactly
what we pictured, but...

131
00:10:39,723 --> 00:10:43,018
- we'll love him like he was our own.
- No, no, no.

132
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:46,271
This little fellow
belongs to the Hendersons.

133
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:56,239
- So glad you'll be nursing.
- Congratulations.

134
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:59,284
Mr. and Mrs. Rubble,
this is your little boy.

135
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:03,455
Barney, isn't he precious?

136
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:08,752
- Precious? They'd have been
better off with the monkey.
- Fred!

137
00:11:08,752 --> 00:11:11,379
- Does he have a name?
- Bamm-Bamm.

138
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:14,549
- Is that short for somethin'?
- Bamm-Bamm-Bamm.

139
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,763
You're going to have to take it
slowly with this one.

140
00:11:19,763 --> 00:11:23,558
He doesn't speak yet, and he's
a little skittish around humans.

141
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:28,355
But then again, I would be too if
I had been raised by wild mastodons.

142
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:33,610
- Mastodons?
- Let's not nitpick. A mammal's a mammal.

143
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:37,280
Well, sounds to me like
all he needs is a little lovin'.

144
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:40,075
Ohh.

145
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:42,827
Come here, little guy.

146
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:46,081
- Aah! He growled. Yeah.
- That's cute.

147
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:49,042
It's okay, little guy.
I'm your da-da.

148
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:01,846
Bamm-Bamm!

149
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:03,890
Oh! Barney!

150
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:06,685
- Oh, Betty!
- Bamm-Bamm! No!

151
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:17,612
Bamm-Bamm!
Bamm-Bamm, wait!

152
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:23,993
Stalactite, stalagmite
Hold your baby very tight

153
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:39,175
- Come back!
- Come here, little guy!

154
00:12:41,845 --> 00:12:44,097
- Bamm-Bamm! Bamm! Bamm-Bamm!
- Ohhh!

155
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:46,850
- Rock with the caveman
- Bamm-Bamm-Bamm-Bamm-Bamm!

156
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:48,852
Roll with the caveman

157
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:51,813
Shake to the caveman

158
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:54,315
- Break with the caveman
- Oof!

159
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:58,069
- Make with the caveman
Okay, give me a C-A-V-E
- Who-o-o-a!

160
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:02,032
- M-A-N, Caveman
- Whoa!

161
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:04,993
What an arm!

162
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:11,666
"And Cinderocka married
the handsome prince, and..

163
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:23,553
and they lived
happily ever after".

164
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:52,749
Yeah!

165
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:59,673
Okay, Brother Flintstone,
we need a strike to win.

166
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:01,633
Can you do it?

167
00:14:01,925 --> 00:14:03,802
Is the Earth flat?

168
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:11,309
- Come on, Freddie!
- Come on, hit it!

169
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:18,483
Come on, twinkle toes.

170
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:33,289
Fred!

171
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:36,501
- Waka-waka-woo!
- Waka-waka-woo!

172
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:40,171
- Wooga-wooga-wee!
- Wooga-wooga-wee!

173
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:42,924
Piki-piki-piki!
Poki-poki-poki!

174
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,719
Ahhhhhhhh-oooh!

175
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:48,054
Lava juice!

176
00:14:48,972 --> 00:14:51,474
Hey, can I have everybody's
attention, please?

177
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:54,060
I would like to
propose a toast...

178
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:57,814
to not only a great bowler,
but a great human being.

179
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:01,735
And no offense to you guys.

180
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:06,906
"Since I was just a lad of ten,
I've had the very bestest friend.

181
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:10,410
He may be big,
he may be loud,

182
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:15,665
so you'll never lose him
in a crowd.

183
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:18,710
But for my friend
the special part...

184
00:15:19,002 --> 00:15:21,755
is what's behind his ribs..
his heart.

185
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:24,924
I owe my son to him, and now...

186
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:29,596
I stand before my peers
and vow...

187
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:33,266
I'll pay him back,
someday, somehow".

188
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,980
The end.

189
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:51,743
- That was beautiful, Barn.
- I meant every word of it, Fred.

190
00:15:52,035 --> 00:15:54,996
- Care to join me in a cold one?
- Love to.

191
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:04,839
It doesn't get
any better than this.

192
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:44,879
Ohh!

193
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:47,841
No.

194
00:16:54,097 --> 00:16:55,724
Look at him.

195
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:58,226
Drunk as a skunkosaurus.

196
00:16:58,601 --> 00:16:59,978
Aaaah!

197
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:02,814
Mother, I can handle this.

198
00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:07,027
What's that old fossil doing here?
Did the tar pits back up again?

199
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:11,322
Well, somebody has to be here looking
after my daughter and grandchild...

200
00:17:12,115 --> 00:17:15,118
while you're out carousing
with a bunch of Neanderthals.

201
00:17:15,118 --> 00:17:17,912
Oh, really?
Well, for your information,

202
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:20,749
the lodge no longer
accepts Neanderthals.

203
00:17:20,749 --> 00:17:24,127
He robs your nest egg to bail
out that little troll next door...

204
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:27,589
while my daughter has to
wash her clothes in the river.

205
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:31,926
- I got half a mind..
- Oh, don't flatter yourself.

206
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:34,137
That's it!
Where's my club, Wilma?

207
00:17:34,137 --> 00:17:36,222
You just try it, fatso!

208
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:39,642
- If you was a man, I'd knock you..
- Enough! Mother! Fred!

209
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:42,479
You two should be
ashamed of yourselves!

210
00:17:43,146 --> 00:17:46,149
I've got my hands full
just being ashamed of him.

211
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:49,152
- You got your hands full
when you scratch your neck!
- Stop it!

212
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:50,779
Both of you!

213
00:17:51,154 --> 00:17:54,532
Mother, Fred is a loving husband
and a good provider.

214
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:58,161
Oh, really? What has he ever
provided you besides shade?

215
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:01,206
Oh, Wilma,

216
00:18:02,165 --> 00:18:04,668
you could've married
Elliot Firestone,

217
00:18:04,668 --> 00:18:07,087
the man who invented the wheel.

218
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:09,673
Instead you picked
Fred Flintstone,

219
00:18:09,673 --> 00:18:12,175
the man who invented
the excuse.

220
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:16,179
Let me tell you something, Pearl..
I'm not going to be a nobody all my life.

221
00:18:16,179 --> 00:18:19,683
One of these days, I'm gonna be
a somebody, a real somebody!

222
00:18:19,683 --> 00:18:23,186
We'll live in luxury, and Wilma
will have everything she deserves.

223
00:18:23,186 --> 00:18:26,189
When that day comes,
you'll be so busy eatin' crow...

224
00:18:26,189 --> 00:18:28,983
you'll be passing feathers
for a month!

225
00:18:29,693 --> 00:18:31,820
Oh, you poor, poor dear.

226
00:18:32,696 --> 00:18:36,533
And when I think of all the sacrifices
your father made for you.

227
00:18:38,201 --> 00:18:39,828
Lambs, oxen,

228
00:18:40,704 --> 00:18:42,622
your brother Jerry.

229
00:18:43,206 --> 00:18:45,250
- Well..
- Oh, Wilma.

230
00:18:45,709 --> 00:18:47,794
Do your mother a favor.

231
00:18:48,211 --> 00:18:50,213
Just call Elliot Firestone.

232
00:18:50,213 --> 00:18:52,590
Even if things don't work out,

233
00:18:52,841 --> 00:18:55,802
he can give you
a great deal on some tires.

234
00:18:56,219 --> 00:18:58,555
- Yes, Mother.
- Byesie-bye.

235
00:18:58,722 --> 00:19:01,349
I'll show her.
I'll show everybody.

236
00:19:01,725 --> 00:19:03,727
I know you will, Fred.

237
00:19:03,727 --> 00:19:06,563
- Call me fatso.
- Let's get some sleep.

238
00:19:28,752 --> 00:19:30,879
Hey, what's the special?

239
00:19:40,764 --> 00:19:42,515
This job sucks.

240
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:48,772
- What you got today?
- Lizard and onions. Want half?

241
00:19:48,772 --> 00:19:50,106
Sure.

242
00:19:54,778 --> 00:19:57,781
I hear that eatin'
too much red meat is bad for you.

243
00:19:57,781 --> 00:19:59,741
What a load of bunk.

244
00:19:59,783 --> 00:20:04,079
My father ate it every day of his life;
he lived to the ripe old age of 38.

245
00:20:04,287 --> 00:20:06,289
May I have
your attention!

246
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:08,792
I have a very important
announcement to make.

247
00:20:08,792 --> 00:20:12,796
- You found out why the guys
in pit 6 are losing their hair?
- Yes!

248
00:20:12,796 --> 00:20:17,300
And we are currently
in the process of refuting
the results of that investigation.

249
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,344
But today I am here...

250
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:21,304
to formally announce
the creation...

251
00:20:21,304 --> 00:20:24,599
of Slate and Company's
executive placement program.

252
00:20:24,808 --> 00:20:27,102
Hold your questions, please.

253
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:30,814
That's right; this Saturday
an aptitude test will be given,

254
00:20:30,814 --> 00:20:33,316
granting one of you
the opportunity...

255
00:20:33,316 --> 00:20:35,819
to crawl out
of the primordial ooze...

256
00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:37,654
and be somebody..

257
00:20:38,321 --> 00:20:40,323
A vice president
at Slate and Company,

258
00:20:40,323 --> 00:20:43,368
with an obscene salary
and a shiny nameplate.

259
00:20:45,328 --> 00:20:46,621
Ooh.

260
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:50,083
Good luck,
and may the best biped win.

261
00:20:52,335 --> 00:20:55,463
An executive?
This is my chance to be somebody.

262
00:20:56,339 --> 00:20:57,966
Be somebody.

263
00:20:59,509 --> 00:21:00,844
Whee!

264
00:21:03,513 --> 00:21:05,765
Higher, Bamm-Bamm,
higher!

265
00:21:06,516 --> 00:21:08,268
Higher! Higher!

266
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:10,854
Whee!

267
00:21:11,521 --> 00:21:13,314
- Wilma.
- Hmm?

268
00:21:13,523 --> 00:21:17,652
- How did you get rid of
the ring around the collar?
- By washing Fred's neck.

269
00:21:17,652 --> 00:21:21,031
Hmm. You know, if Fred scores
the highest on that test,

270
00:21:21,031 --> 00:21:24,034
you'll be able to hire someone
to do your laundry for you.

271
00:21:24,034 --> 00:21:28,538
If Fred scores the highest on that test,
I'll have to hire someone to revive me.

272
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:33,918
Oh, it's true;
Fred's no Albert Einstone.

273
00:21:34,044 --> 00:21:36,046
- But he may surprise you.
- Whee!

274
00:21:36,046 --> 00:21:37,672
Well, maybe.

275
00:21:38,048 --> 00:21:40,550
- He has been studying day and night.
- Whee!

276
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:45,472
I know! I've never seen him
so excited about something you
couldn't spread mayonnaise on.

277
00:21:51,561 --> 00:21:54,064
Barn, I've been thinking
about this executive job.

278
00:21:54,064 --> 00:21:55,690
It's not me.

279
00:21:56,066 --> 00:21:59,027
Cooped up inside
some swank office all day,

280
00:21:59,069 --> 00:22:01,071
kissing the big shot's feet.

281
00:22:01,071 --> 00:22:03,031
Not Fred Flintstone.

282
00:22:03,073 --> 00:22:05,075
Why, good afternoon,
Mr. Vandercave.

283
00:22:05,075 --> 00:22:08,912
- My, that's a handsome pelt
you're wearing today.
- Thank you.

284
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,083
Your attention, please!
Please take your seats.

285
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:14,834
And... welcome.

286
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:18,588
You will have one hour
to complete the exam.

287
00:22:18,588 --> 00:22:22,258
Please carve all answers
with a well-sharpened No. 2 chisel.

288
00:22:24,094 --> 00:22:26,096
On behalf
of Slate and Company,

289
00:22:26,096 --> 00:22:29,140
I want to wish you all
the very best of luck.

290
00:22:32,102 --> 00:22:33,728
Let's begin.

291
00:23:08,138 --> 00:23:09,472
Eeee!

292
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:21,943
Ohh.

293
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:25,947
Chisels down.

294
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,662
Please slide
your answer slab...

295
00:23:33,163 --> 00:23:35,165
into the numbered envelope
provided...

296
00:23:35,165 --> 00:23:37,709
and stack them neatly
on my desk.

297
00:23:38,668 --> 00:23:41,087
Psst! Hey, Fred!
How'd you do?

298
00:23:41,671 --> 00:23:43,757
How'd I do? How'd I do?

299
00:23:51,181 --> 00:23:54,809
- You want me to take that up for you?
- Yeah. Thanks, pal.

300
00:24:04,694 --> 00:24:07,447
"And I stand
before my peers and vow,

301
00:24:08,198 --> 00:24:10,950
I'll pay him back,
someday, somehow".

302
00:24:29,344 --> 00:24:30,637
Ahh.

303
00:24:34,724 --> 00:24:37,435
Well, Cliff,
the test results are in.

304
00:24:37,727 --> 00:24:39,729
And our unsuspecting dupe is?

305
00:24:39,729 --> 00:24:43,733
Believe it or not, the one who scored
the highest was Fred Flintstone.

306
00:24:43,733 --> 00:24:46,695
- That big ape?
- No, the big ape got a 65.

307
00:24:46,736 --> 00:24:48,738
Flintstone?
Oh, this can't be right!

308
00:24:48,738 --> 00:24:51,741
He must have cheated.
He's dense, he's witless..

309
00:24:51,741 --> 00:24:53,410
He's perfect.

310
00:24:54,744 --> 00:24:57,247
The results of the exam
were very competitive,

311
00:24:57,247 --> 00:25:00,375
and just because an applicant
was not selected...

312
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:02,877
is no indication
of lack of ability.

313
00:25:02,877 --> 00:25:06,256
- I am pleased to announce...
- I know a kiss-off
when I hear one; let's go.

314
00:25:06,256 --> 00:25:08,258
that the newest member
of our executive rank...

315
00:25:08,258 --> 00:25:10,343
is Mr. Fred Flintstone!

316
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,555
- Huh?
- Barney, quick. What's my name?

317
00:25:14,264 --> 00:25:16,766
- Fred Flintstone!
- Don't toy with me, Barney.

318
00:25:16,766 --> 00:25:18,768
You did it, Fred!
You made it!

319
00:25:18,768 --> 00:25:20,812
Yabba-dabba-dabba-doo!

320
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,864
Good morning,
Mr. Vice President.

321
00:26:13,323 --> 00:26:15,867
Good morning, Mrs. Vice President.

322
00:26:19,829 --> 00:26:21,915
Oh, Dino! Oh, Dino, no!

323
00:26:24,834 --> 00:26:26,169
Aaah!

324
00:26:27,837 --> 00:26:29,547
- Hey!
- Mmm!

325
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:31,383
Atta baby!

326
00:26:33,343 --> 00:26:34,969
Heh heh heh.

327
00:26:36,846 --> 00:26:38,139
Ohh.

328
00:26:44,354 --> 00:26:46,106
Good boy, Dino.

329
00:27:07,877 --> 00:27:09,838
Well, how do I look?

330
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:12,048
Daddy pretty.

331
00:27:12,882 --> 00:27:14,551
It's perfect!

332
00:27:14,884 --> 00:27:16,553
Yeah. Snazzy.

333
00:27:18,388 --> 00:27:21,307
What am I gonna call you now?
Boss? Chief?

334
00:27:21,891 --> 00:27:24,394
No, a simple
"Your Highness" will do.

335
00:27:24,394 --> 00:27:25,895
No, Barn,

336
00:27:26,896 --> 00:27:31,401
I'm not gonna be one of
these guys that makes it and
then forgets where he came from.

337
00:27:31,401 --> 00:27:35,405
The first thing I'm gonna do
is get everyone in the quarry
some vacation time.

338
00:27:35,405 --> 00:27:38,408
And maybe a health plan
with free foot care.

339
00:27:38,408 --> 00:27:41,911
I'd settle for them little packets
of ketchup for the lunch room.

340
00:27:41,911 --> 00:27:44,748
- I'm only one man.
- Not from the back.

341
00:27:44,914 --> 00:27:46,416
Hey, hey.

342
00:27:49,419 --> 00:27:52,297
Well, I guess this is it,
Mr. Flintstone.

343
00:27:59,429 --> 00:28:01,389
Go get 'em, big guy.

344
00:28:04,434 --> 00:28:06,686
- Hey, Barn.
- Yeah, Fred?

345
00:28:07,437 --> 00:28:10,398
Could you spot me
a couple bucks for lunch?

346
00:28:12,942 --> 00:28:14,861
You're right, Fred.

347
00:28:16,071 --> 00:28:17,947
Nothing's changed.

348
00:28:38,468 --> 00:28:40,720
Welcome aboard, Flintstone!

349
00:28:41,471 --> 00:28:44,057
We're glad you're here.
Nice suit!

350
00:28:44,974 --> 00:28:47,602
You know, Fred,
any gravel brain...

351
00:28:47,977 --> 00:28:51,189
can shovel rock
down in the quarry, but up here..

352
00:28:51,481 --> 00:28:55,485
- Do you know what we do up here?
- Me and the guys have always wondered.

353
00:28:55,485 --> 00:28:57,654
We interface, Flintstone.

354
00:28:57,987 --> 00:29:00,073
We strategize, analyze,

355
00:29:01,116 --> 00:29:02,992
conceptualize, prioritize.. 

356
00:29:02,992 --> 00:29:04,744
When do we eat?

357
00:29:05,495 --> 00:29:09,332
Fred, until this moment I wasn't sure
we'd picked the right man.

358
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,793
Now I'm certain.

359
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:21,803
Fred Flintstone,

360
00:29:22,012 --> 00:29:23,763
you've arrived.

361
00:29:26,016 --> 00:29:28,518
- This is my office?
- That's right.

362
00:29:28,518 --> 00:29:30,895
- This is my chair?
- Mm-hmm.

363
00:29:31,021 --> 00:29:35,025
Not to throw too much at you
on your first day, but this
big thing here is your desk.

364
00:29:35,025 --> 00:29:38,528
- My desk?
- Watch out for your fingers
in the drawers.

365
00:29:41,531 --> 00:29:43,408
Am I interrupting?

366
00:29:44,034 --> 00:29:47,620
Not at all. Fred, I'd like you
to meet your new secretary,

367
00:29:48,038 --> 00:29:50,540
- Miss Sharon Stone.
- My secretary?

368
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:53,168
Personal secretary,
Mr. Flintstone.

369
00:29:53,543 --> 00:29:56,171
That is, of course,
if you want me.

370
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:01,426
Great.

371
00:30:02,552 --> 00:30:05,805
Well, I'm sure the two
of you would like to get...

372
00:30:06,056 --> 00:30:07,932
better acquainted.

373
00:30:12,062 --> 00:30:14,564
Mr. Flintstone,
I'd like you to know...

374
00:30:14,564 --> 00:30:17,609
that I enjoy working
long hours, late nights,

375
00:30:18,568 --> 00:30:20,278
even weekends.

376
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:22,739
So feel free to use me...

377
00:30:24,074 --> 00:30:26,034
however you see fit.

378
00:30:27,577 --> 00:30:29,871
Now, can I get you anything?

379
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,956
- Coffee?
- Sure.

380
00:30:34,584 --> 00:30:37,253
- How would you like it?
- In a cup?

381
00:30:38,588 --> 00:30:40,590
Bold choice,
Mr. Flintstone!

382
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:43,009
You'll go far
in this company.

383
00:30:55,105 --> 00:30:57,774
Take a memo.
Cliff, let's play golf.

384
00:30:59,109 --> 00:31:02,529
We can prioritize, conceptualize
and, uh... tenderize.

385
00:31:03,113 --> 00:31:05,824
Executively yours,
Fred Fli.. Aaaaah!

386
00:31:07,617 --> 00:31:10,787
Are there six or seven
"Is" in "Fli.. Aaah"?

387
00:31:11,121 --> 00:31:14,124
- Who said that?
- It was I, your dictabird.

388
00:31:14,624 --> 00:31:17,460
- Dicta-what?
- Dictabird. Read my beak.

389
00:31:17,627 --> 00:31:19,629
"Cliff, let's play golf.

390
00:31:19,629 --> 00:31:23,049
We can prioritize, conceptualize
and, uh, tenderize".

391
00:31:24,509 --> 00:31:26,011
Wow. Wow!

392
00:31:28,138 --> 00:31:31,516
Mr. Flintstone, I'd like to warn
you that management positions...

393
00:31:31,516 --> 00:31:33,518
are fraught with peril.

394
00:31:33,518 --> 00:31:37,522
Whenever you find yourself
in a befuddled state,
I urge you to avail yourself...

395
00:31:37,522 --> 00:31:40,066
of my experience
and sage advice.

396
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:42,235
Oh, really?

397
00:31:42,527 --> 00:31:45,530
- Listen, birdie, let's get
the pecking order straight here.
- Hmm.

398
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:48,992
I don't need any help from you.
I'm Vice President of..

399
00:31:49,534 --> 00:31:50,994
Of, uh..

400
00:31:54,039 --> 00:31:56,124
Industrial procurement.

401
00:31:57,167 --> 00:31:59,419
How about that?
Excuse me.

402
00:32:02,547 --> 00:32:04,090
Hey, guys!

403
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:07,344
Guess what I am!

404
00:32:07,552 --> 00:32:10,430
Vice President of
Industrial Procurement!

405
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,062
Oy! Whew.

406
00:32:18,563 --> 00:32:19,898
Yeah.

407
00:32:21,566 --> 00:32:24,694
There. I'm all done with
the requisition forms.

408
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:27,447
What do you think?

409
00:32:28,073 --> 00:32:29,741
It's perfect.

410
00:32:31,076 --> 00:32:33,078
Looks just like the real one.

411
00:32:33,078 --> 00:32:36,915
Mr. Flintstone, you are about
to embezzle a great deal of money.

412
00:32:38,083 --> 00:32:41,002
Unfortunately, for you,
we get to keep it.

413
00:32:41,586 --> 00:32:44,589
We can have Flintstone
sign these right away.

414
00:32:44,589 --> 00:32:46,257
Not just yet.

415
00:32:46,591 --> 00:32:49,761
Creatures like
this Flintstone are... primitive,

416
00:32:50,595 --> 00:32:53,098
prone to irrational
bouts of integrity.

417
00:32:53,098 --> 00:32:56,851
We've got to make absolutely certain
he'll do whatever we say.

418
00:33:02,232 --> 00:33:04,943
Fred is the greatest bowler
on Earth.

419
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:07,987
"Fred is the greatest bowler
on Earth".

420
00:33:08,113 --> 00:33:11,199
Now you talk, and see
how much I can remember.

421
00:33:12,117 --> 00:33:13,785
Workin' hard?

422
00:33:16,121 --> 00:33:19,708
Okay, Fred, are you ready for
your first executive action?

423
00:33:20,625 --> 00:33:23,294
Whatever you need,
consider it done!

424
00:33:23,628 --> 00:33:25,630
Good! I want you
to fire Bernard Rubble.

425
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:28,049
Done.. What?
Fire Barney? Why?

426
00:33:28,633 --> 00:33:32,137
Well, for starters, he scored the lowest
on the management aptitude test.

427
00:33:32,137 --> 00:33:36,141
He's an imbecile.
The company can't afford to have
dead weight like him on the payroll!

428
00:33:36,141 --> 00:33:39,477
But, Mr. Vandercave,
he's got a new kid, a mortgage.

429
00:33:40,645 --> 00:33:43,023
I'm his best friend.
I can't.

430
00:33:43,148 --> 00:33:45,442
Fred, if you don't fire him,

431
00:33:46,651 --> 00:33:48,069
I will.

432
00:33:48,653 --> 00:33:50,739
And then I'll fire you.

433
00:34:03,668 --> 00:34:08,173
Come on, Fred, usually you're
yakkin' my ear off, but today
you haven't said two words.

434
00:34:08,173 --> 00:34:11,176
Something exciting
must have happened up there.

435
00:34:11,176 --> 00:34:14,971
- You don't want to know,
Barn, believe me.
- Sure I do, Fred.

436
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:18,183
You're the first one of us
to make it out of that quarry.

437
00:34:18,183 --> 00:34:21,978
Look at me. I'll probably be
working there the rest of my life.

438
00:34:22,187 --> 00:34:24,147
No, you won't, Barn.

439
00:34:24,189 --> 00:34:26,149
Take my word for it.

440
00:34:29,194 --> 00:34:32,697
Come take a look.. It's a dish
in the shower, you keep the soap in it.

441
00:34:32,697 --> 00:34:36,326
- Barney, there's something
we gotta talk about.
- Yeah, yeah. Later, Fred.

442
00:34:36,326 --> 00:34:37,827
Surprise!

443
00:34:38,203 --> 00:34:39,996
Way to go, Fred!

444
00:34:54,219 --> 00:34:56,721
- Wilma, you shouldn't have.
- Hmm?

445
00:34:56,721 --> 00:34:59,849
I didn't. This was all
Barney and Betty's idea.

446
00:35:01,226 --> 00:35:04,396
Aren't we lucky to have friends
like them, Fred?

447
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:06,523
Ohh!

448
00:35:07,232 --> 00:35:08,858
There he is!

449
00:35:09,734 --> 00:35:12,404
There's my big,
handsome son-in-law!

450
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,242
Have you lost weight?

451
00:35:17,242 --> 00:35:18,868
Have we met?

452
00:35:20,745 --> 00:35:23,248
Can I have everybody's
attention, please?

453
00:35:23,248 --> 00:35:25,750
I've got something
I'd like to say.

454
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:28,086
I hope it's not another poem.

455
00:35:30,755 --> 00:35:33,258
Betty, Bamm-Bamm and I
could not be happier,

456
00:35:33,258 --> 00:35:36,302
- even if it was me that got that job.
- Aww!

457
00:35:37,262 --> 00:35:40,974
So we got a little something
to show how proud of you we are.

458
00:35:41,266 --> 00:35:43,435
Congratulations, big guy!

459
00:35:46,896 --> 00:35:48,773
Barney, I can't accept this.

460
00:35:48,773 --> 00:35:50,775
- Sure, you can.
- No, I can't. Take it back.

461
00:35:50,775 --> 00:35:54,404
- We can't.
We had your initials branded on it.
- It's yours, Fred.

462
00:35:54,404 --> 00:35:57,282
- No, it's not!
- Fred, what's wrong with you?

463
00:35:57,282 --> 00:35:59,200
It's a lovely gift.

464
00:35:59,284 --> 00:36:02,287
- He's thrilled to receive it.
Aren't you, Fred?
- No!

465
00:36:02,287 --> 00:36:05,790
- Don't you like the color?
- It's not the briefcase,
it's not the color.

466
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:08,293
- I just can't take anything from you.
- But, Fred..

467
00:36:08,293 --> 00:36:10,253
Take a hike, shorty.

468
00:36:10,795 --> 00:36:13,673
My Freddie doesn't want
that tacky thing.

469
00:36:14,799 --> 00:36:17,802
- How come, Fred?
- Because you can't afford it, Barn.

470
00:36:17,802 --> 00:36:19,095
Ohh.

471
00:36:19,804 --> 00:36:21,598
Sure I can, pal.

472
00:36:22,307 --> 00:36:23,933
Not anymore.

473
00:36:24,809 --> 00:36:26,978
- You're fired.
- Fired?

474
00:36:33,818 --> 00:36:35,153
Well!

475
00:36:36,321 --> 00:36:39,783
Let's not let a little thing
like this spoil the party!

476
00:36:40,825 --> 00:36:42,410
Conga line!

477
00:36:43,328 --> 00:36:44,996
Conga! Conga!

478
00:36:53,338 --> 00:36:55,340
Don't worry about me, Fred.

479
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:59,719
- I've been working in that quarry
since it was eight feet deep.
- Atta boy!

480
00:36:59,844 --> 00:37:03,139
There could be a whole new world
opening up for me.

481
00:37:03,348 --> 00:37:07,686
- Maybe I'll take in that
franchise show this weekend.
- That's the spirit.

482
00:37:08,853 --> 00:37:11,356
There's just one thing
I gotta know.

483
00:37:11,356 --> 00:37:14,651
After all these years,
how come they're canning me?

484
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,695
Barn,

485
00:37:17,362 --> 00:37:19,572
you're a wonderful father,

486
00:37:19,864 --> 00:37:21,700
a loving husband,

487
00:37:21,866 --> 00:37:23,576
a hard worker,

488
00:37:23,868 --> 00:37:26,329
and one heck of a little bowler.

489
00:37:26,871 --> 00:37:30,166
But, Barn, none of that counts
on an aptitude test.

490
00:37:33,003 --> 00:37:35,380
You got the lowest score, pal.

491
00:37:37,382 --> 00:37:39,217
The lowest score?

492
00:38:00,905 --> 00:38:03,074
Wilma, that is beautiful!

493
00:38:04,909 --> 00:38:07,912
- Well, I have always wanted...
- You can't catch me!

494
00:38:07,912 --> 00:38:10,290
- a Halstone original.
- Mmm.

495
00:38:11,916 --> 00:38:14,586
- Ohh!
- Now, Wilma, don't be silly!

496
00:38:49,954 --> 00:38:52,832
if it means laying off
all those workers.

497
00:38:52,957 --> 00:38:55,460
Some have been here
since the beginning of time.

498
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:57,462
What if I could
quadruple your income?

499
00:38:57,462 --> 00:38:59,964
I'll miss them.
You were saying?

500
00:39:01,466 --> 00:39:04,052
Sorry I'm late.
I had car trouble.

501
00:39:04,969 --> 00:39:06,805
Picked up a nail.

502
00:39:06,971 --> 00:39:09,474
Thank you for sharing that,
Mr. Flagstone.

503
00:39:09,474 --> 00:39:11,643
- F..
- May we continue?

504
00:39:14,479 --> 00:39:16,481
Mr. Slate. Gentlemen.

505
00:39:16,481 --> 00:39:18,400
I have... a vision.

506
00:39:20,985 --> 00:39:24,197
While our competitors
are mired in the Stone Age,

507
00:39:24,489 --> 00:39:26,700
I give you...
the future!

508
00:39:27,617 --> 00:39:29,994
- Ohh.
- Slate and Company...

509
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:32,997
will revolutionize
the building industry...

510
00:39:32,997 --> 00:39:34,958
by providing simple,

511
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:38,003
low-cost,
modular housing units.

512
00:39:38,003 --> 00:39:39,963
Impossible, you say?

513
00:39:40,005 --> 00:39:41,923
Let me demonstrate.

514
00:39:42,007 --> 00:39:44,843
Through the miracle
of geothermal power,

515
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:48,221
the raw material is elevated to
the second stage,

516
00:39:49,014 --> 00:39:51,516
- where our steam-powered
conveyor belt carries..
- Steam?

517
00:39:51,516 --> 00:39:53,226
He's a madman!

518
00:39:54,519 --> 00:39:56,980
Steam-powered
conveyor belts...

519
00:39:57,022 --> 00:40:00,400
carry the product to be shaped,
cleaned, inspected...

520
00:40:01,026 --> 00:40:04,195
and delivered to
discerning consumers worldwide.

521
00:40:07,032 --> 00:40:10,035
And did I mention increasing
our profit margin...

522
00:40:10,035 --> 00:40:13,121
- fourfold?
- Very impressive, Mr. Vandercave.

523
00:40:14,039 --> 00:40:18,084
Very impressive. I think we should
implement this system immediately.

524
00:40:20,045 --> 00:40:21,338
Yes?

525
00:40:22,547 --> 00:40:25,550
Excuse me, Mr. Slate.
I know I'm the new man here,

526
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:29,262
but I don't think you hired me
to sit around and look pretty.

527
00:40:29,679 --> 00:40:33,475
I hate to bust your bubble,
but if you build houses this small,

528
00:40:33,558 --> 00:40:35,685
who's gonna live in 'em?

529
00:40:42,067 --> 00:40:44,569
- Excuse me. Mrs. Rubble?
- Yes.

530
00:40:45,195 --> 00:40:48,740
There seems to be a slight problem
with your credit card.

531
00:40:49,074 --> 00:40:51,201
Really?
And what would that be?

532
00:40:51,201 --> 00:40:53,078
It's no damn good!

533
00:41:01,086 --> 00:41:04,381
I have never been so embarrassed
in my entire life.

534
00:41:04,589 --> 00:41:08,426
- Go and play, children.
- Wilma, I promise you I'll pay you back.

535
00:41:09,594 --> 00:41:12,555
- I just don't know when.
- Oh, now, Betty.

536
00:41:13,098 --> 00:41:16,184
- It can't be as bad as all that.
- But it is.

537
00:41:16,601 --> 00:41:20,105
Barney's still out of work;
we've nearly spent all of our savings.

538
00:41:20,105 --> 00:41:23,358
And, Wilma, what if
the adoption agency finds out?

539
00:41:28,613 --> 00:41:30,990
I don't want to
lose my baby.

540
00:41:31,616 --> 00:41:35,078
I swear, Betty, Fred and I
would never let that happen.

541
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:37,831
- Oh, Wilma.
- Oh, Betty.

542
00:41:43,003 --> 00:41:44,879
Pterodactyl alert!

543
00:41:46,131 --> 00:41:47,757
Mommy, help!

544
00:41:54,139 --> 00:41:56,099
- Oh, yuck!
- Ecch!

545
00:41:56,933 --> 00:41:58,935
And in conclusion,
Mr. Slate,

546
00:41:58,935 --> 00:42:02,439
I feel a paid vacation for everyone
in the quarry would raise morale...

547
00:42:02,439 --> 00:42:04,441
and increase productivity,

548
00:42:04,441 --> 00:42:06,609
um, um...
a whole bunch!

549
00:42:06,943 --> 00:42:09,821
Sincerely yours,
Frederick J. Flintstone.

550
00:42:10,447 --> 00:42:13,450
Shall I make that "Flagstone,"
so he'll know who it's from?

551
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:15,994
My, don't we look
handsome today?

552
00:42:16,453 --> 00:42:17,954
Thank you.

553
00:42:17,954 --> 00:42:20,749
Here are today's batch
of requisitions,

554
00:42:20,957 --> 00:42:24,252
- all marked and ready
for your signature.
- Okay.

555
00:42:24,961 --> 00:42:26,963
You know, Miss Stone,

556
00:42:26,963 --> 00:42:31,593
I've been signing stacks of
these for weeks, and I hate
to pry, but what are they?

557
00:42:32,969 --> 00:42:34,971
Oh, just
tiny little forms...

558
00:42:34,971 --> 00:42:38,808
so that we can pay the contractors
working on the modernization.

559
00:42:40,477 --> 00:42:43,480
We remodeled our kitchen
a couple of years ago,

560
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:46,858
and let me tell you,
contractors can be real pirates.

561
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:51,196
- I'm gonna read these over.
- No!

562
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:56,576
You're much too busy for that,
Mr. Flintstone.

563
00:42:57,494 --> 00:42:58,953
Besides,

564
00:42:58,995 --> 00:43:00,872
reading is my job.

565
00:43:02,499 --> 00:43:05,502
You wouldn't want to put
poor little old me...

566
00:43:05,502 --> 00:43:07,837
out of work,
now, would you?

567
00:43:08,129 --> 00:43:09,381
No.

568
00:43:14,010 --> 00:43:15,887
Your wife. Mm-mmm.

569
00:43:17,013 --> 00:43:19,432
- Your wife.
- My wife. Wilma?

570
00:43:19,516 --> 00:43:22,560
- Wilma! What a surprise!
- So it would seem.

571
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:26,523
Miss Stone, I'd like you
to meet my wife Mrs. Flagstone...

572
00:43:26,523 --> 00:43:29,025
and our daughter, um, um, um, um..

573
00:43:29,025 --> 00:43:31,486
Isn't she beautiful?
My family.

574
00:43:31,653 --> 00:43:35,156
- I've heard so much about you.
- Well, I wish that I could say the same.

575
00:43:35,156 --> 00:43:39,035
That'll be all, Miss Stone.
I'll sign those documents
and place them on your desk.

576
00:43:39,035 --> 00:43:40,912
Whatever you want.

577
00:43:46,543 --> 00:43:50,380
- Your secretary is very attractive.
- Really? I hadn't noticed.

578
00:43:50,547 --> 00:43:54,217
- Did I mention she chisels
eighteen words a minute?
- Hmm.

579
00:43:55,552 --> 00:43:58,430
Hey, Wilma, did ya ever see
one of these?

580
00:44:00,557 --> 00:44:03,059
My wife is the most
beautiful gal in Bedrock.

581
00:44:03,059 --> 00:44:06,688
- "My wife is the most
beautiful gal in Bedrock".
- Nice try, Fred.

582
00:44:06,688 --> 00:44:08,606
"Nice try, Fred".

583
00:44:09,566 --> 00:44:12,902
Fred! I've come to talk
about the Rubbles' troubles.

584
00:44:13,570 --> 00:44:15,572
Hasn't Barney
found a job yet?

585
00:44:15,572 --> 00:44:20,035
It's gotten so bad, they've had to rent
out their house just to make ends meet.

586
00:44:20,076 --> 00:44:22,662
Really.
Where are they gonna live?

587
00:44:28,585 --> 00:44:30,962
So glad you're over your cold.

588
00:44:31,588 --> 00:44:33,131
Thank you.

589
00:44:42,599 --> 00:44:44,601
Isn't this nice, Betty?

590
00:44:44,601 --> 00:44:47,937
The Flintstones and the Rubbles,
all under one roof.

591
00:44:48,104 --> 00:44:52,108
Yes, but this is such an imposition.
Are you sure it's okay with Fred?

592
00:44:52,108 --> 00:44:53,860
Oh, absolutely.

593
00:44:55,111 --> 00:44:58,239
As a matter of fact,
he thinks it was his idea.

594
00:44:59,741 --> 00:45:02,994
- Hey, Freddie, a couple of cool ones.
- Oh, yeah.

595
00:45:08,124 --> 00:45:10,043
How about it, Barn?

596
00:45:11,127 --> 00:45:15,048
- Flintstones and Rubbles under one roof.
- But it's only temporary.

597
00:45:15,256 --> 00:45:17,008
It'd better be.

598
00:45:20,136 --> 00:45:22,138
- It'd better be!
- Yeah!

599
00:45:22,138 --> 00:45:25,642
Ah, Barn, I admire ya;
you've lost your job, your dignity,

600
00:45:25,642 --> 00:45:27,936
but not your sense of humor.

601
00:45:29,270 --> 00:45:31,314
Hey, cut it out, Fred!

602
00:45:33,650 --> 00:45:35,652
You like your steak rare?

603
00:45:35,652 --> 00:45:37,654
- Yeah.
- That one's yours.

604
00:45:37,654 --> 00:45:40,699
Hey, hey, stop!
Come here, you purple rodent!

605
00:45:41,157 --> 00:45:44,327
Don't forget to wash that off
before you eat it!

606
00:45:45,662 --> 00:45:47,789
Come here! Give me that!

607
00:45:48,665 --> 00:45:50,417
Help! Somebody!

608
00:45:51,167 --> 00:45:52,544
Ohhhh!

609
00:46:18,695 --> 00:46:20,697
Flintstone gets the rock.

610
00:46:20,697 --> 00:46:23,033
He sets his shot.
He shoots!

611
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:25,493
Ohh!

612
00:46:26,202 --> 00:46:27,829
Oh! Oh, boy.

613
00:46:29,706 --> 00:46:32,334
Miss Stone,
what a pleasant surprise.

614
00:46:32,334 --> 00:46:34,419
Oh. What happened here?

615
00:46:35,712 --> 00:46:39,215
- That's what I'd like to know!
- I'll get someone to fix it.

616
00:46:39,215 --> 00:46:40,967
Oh, Miss Stone?

617
00:46:41,217 --> 00:46:44,220
Before you go, there's
something bothering me...

618
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:47,223
- about this new system
we're putting in here.
- Oh?

619
00:46:47,223 --> 00:46:50,185
Yeah. I don't pretend
to understand it all,

620
00:46:50,226 --> 00:46:53,730
- but wouldn't this put a lot
of my guys out of work?
- How would I know?

621
00:46:53,730 --> 00:46:56,191
I'm just a little ol' secretary.

622
00:46:56,733 --> 00:46:59,235
Are you kiddin' me?
You're smart!

623
00:46:59,235 --> 00:47:01,237
I could tell that right off.

624
00:47:01,237 --> 00:47:04,324
There's a lot more
to you than you.. er.. uh..

625
00:47:05,241 --> 00:47:07,619
- You.. I mean..
- Thank you.

626
00:47:13,249 --> 00:47:17,796
I sure hope I didn't get you
into too much trouble with
your wife the other day.

627
00:47:18,755 --> 00:47:22,092
Nah. Wilma always forgives me.
She knows I love her.

628
00:47:22,884 --> 00:47:25,261
- And you do, don't you?
- Are you kiddin'?

629
00:47:25,261 --> 00:47:29,265
I'll never forget, the first time I met
her. She was working at a restaurant.

630
00:47:29,265 --> 00:47:33,728
I won this "All You Can Eat" contest
and she was the one that cleaned me off.

631
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:45,532
I think I know.

632
00:47:49,285 --> 00:47:51,788
- Where have you been?
- With Fred.

633
00:47:51,788 --> 00:47:53,790
I mean, Mr. Flintstone.

634
00:47:53,790 --> 00:47:55,709
I'm worried, Cliff.

635
00:47:56,292 --> 00:48:00,296
- He's smarter than we thought.
- He'd have to be to get himself
dressed in the morning.

636
00:48:00,296 --> 00:48:02,298
He's been asking
a lot of questions.

637
00:48:02,298 --> 00:48:05,468
I think we should just call
the whole thing off.

638
00:48:05,802 --> 00:48:08,263
No. No, I've got
a better idea.

639
00:48:09,305 --> 00:48:11,766
Why don't we
turn ourselves in,

640
00:48:11,808 --> 00:48:15,812
- then we can rot in jail
until the poles freeze over.
- I was just thinking..

641
00:48:15,812 --> 00:48:18,481
Stick to your strengths,
Miss Stone.

642
00:48:20,316 --> 00:48:22,402
And I'll stick to mine.

643
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:25,280
Besides,

644
00:48:26,322 --> 00:48:29,659
if Mr. Flintstone insists
on being so conscientious,

645
00:48:31,828 --> 00:48:34,080
perhaps we can give Fred...

646
00:48:34,831 --> 00:48:37,709
something to take his mind
off work, hmm?

647
00:48:39,836 --> 00:48:41,838
- A bonus?
- That's right, Fred!

648
00:48:41,838 --> 00:48:43,840
- You deserve it.
- For what?

649
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:46,509
Don't be modest,
you go-getter, you!

650
00:48:47,344 --> 00:48:50,472
And Fred, let me let you in
on a little secret.

651
00:48:50,847 --> 00:48:53,850
If you really want to become
a top executive at this company,

652
00:48:53,850 --> 00:48:56,519
you've got to start
living like one.

653
00:49:07,364 --> 00:49:09,157
Yabba-dabba-doo!

654
00:49:13,870 --> 00:49:16,373
Flintstones
Meet the Flintstones

655
00:49:16,873 --> 00:49:19,501
They're the modern
Stone Age family

656
00:49:20,377 --> 00:49:22,504
From the town of Bedrock

657
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:25,882
- They're a page right out of history
- Good afternoon, madam.

658
00:49:25,882 --> 00:49:28,385
- Full serve, please.
- Let's ride

659
00:49:28,385 --> 00:49:30,387
With the family
down the street

660
00:49:30,387 --> 00:49:33,181
Through the courtesy
of Fred's two feet

661
00:49:33,515 --> 00:49:36,017
When you're
with the Flintstones

662
00:49:36,893 --> 00:49:40,522
- Have a yabba-dabba-doo time
A dabba-doo time
- Oh, dear!

663
00:49:41,398 --> 00:49:43,566
We'll have a gay old time

664
00:49:58,915 --> 00:50:00,417
Good boy.

665
00:50:01,918 --> 00:50:04,921
Good, Wilma! Use your arms.
Perfect. That's four.

666
00:50:04,921 --> 00:50:07,924
- Betty! Towel.
- And good. Five. Strong, tight. Go six.

667
00:50:07,924 --> 00:50:12,137
- Keep going. Go eight.
Strong, tight. Go nine.
- A yabba-dabba-doo time

668
00:50:12,429 --> 00:50:14,222
The Flintstones!

669
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:25,900
We'll have a gay old

670
00:50:27,444 --> 00:50:29,279
- Time
- Ohhhhh!

671
00:50:31,448 --> 00:50:32,782
Yeah!

672
00:50:36,453 --> 00:50:39,164
Who said money
doesn't buy happiness?

673
00:50:39,956 --> 00:50:42,959
But, Fred, isn't this all
too much too fast?

674
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:47,464
Wilma, in the buffet of life
there are no second helpings.

675
00:50:47,464 --> 00:50:50,467
You gotta fill up your plate,
top off your cup,

676
00:50:50,467 --> 00:50:53,178
and stuff a few rolls
in your pocket.

677
00:50:53,970 --> 00:50:55,555
Fred, stop!

678
00:50:56,097 --> 00:50:57,724
Mmm. Frisky!

679
00:51:00,477 --> 00:51:02,937
You know, Barney,
life's funny.

680
00:51:02,979 --> 00:51:05,482
One minute people
are your best friends,

681
00:51:05,482 --> 00:51:09,986
the next you're fantasizing
they're being ripped apart
by a pack of rabid wolves.

682
00:51:09,986 --> 00:51:12,489
- You too, huh?
- Oh, Barney, they've changed.

683
00:51:12,489 --> 00:51:15,492
I hardly know them
since Fred's become such a big shot.

684
00:51:15,492 --> 00:51:19,996
And it should be us
squanderin' all our money and
treatin' our friends like dirt.

685
00:51:19,996 --> 00:51:22,582
- What do you mean?
- Oh, nothin'.

686
00:51:25,502 --> 00:51:27,504
Just sour grapes, I guess.

687
00:51:27,504 --> 00:51:29,506
Oh, don't worry, Barney.

688
00:51:29,506 --> 00:51:31,508
It's gonna get better.

689
00:51:31,508 --> 00:51:35,011
One day we're gonna look back
on all this and we'll laugh.

690
00:51:35,011 --> 00:51:39,140
Geez, I hope so, Betty, 'cause tomorrow
they got me testin' shark repellent.

691
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:41,142
Mmm. Oh, Barney. Ooh.

692
00:51:46,523 --> 00:51:48,233
Leaving early?

693
00:51:49,025 --> 00:51:52,654
Actually, the wife and I were
going to have dinner tonight
at Cavern on the Green.

694
00:51:52,654 --> 00:51:56,199
Ooh, pricey. Be sure to put that
on your expense account.

695
00:51:57,033 --> 00:51:59,035
Fred, before you go..

696
00:51:59,035 --> 00:52:03,039
- Would you mind chipping
your "X" on a couple of these?
- Yeah, sure. What are they?

697
00:52:03,039 --> 00:52:07,877
Well, you sign these and
your buddies down in the quarry
get some much-needed time off.

698
00:52:08,044 --> 00:52:12,549
No kiddin'!
I guess Mr. Slate finally noticed
all those memos I been sendin' in.

699
00:52:12,549 --> 00:52:15,802
I hope the guys will know
who's to thank for this.

700
00:52:16,553 --> 00:52:19,305
I'll make sure
you get all the credit.

701
00:52:25,186 --> 00:52:28,231
Mr. Flintstone,
up to now our relationship...

702
00:52:28,690 --> 00:52:32,652
- has not been based on mutuality
of admiration or respect.
- Huh?

703
00:52:32,819 --> 00:52:36,197
Put simply, you hate my bird guts
and I think you're dumber than mud.

704
00:52:36,197 --> 00:52:40,201
- Ah. Well, good night.
- Still, I wish to pass on
an old dictum...

705
00:52:40,702 --> 00:52:42,704
from business school
that may be apropos.

706
00:52:42,704 --> 00:52:45,206
Only an idiot signs something
before reading it.

707
00:52:45,206 --> 00:52:48,793
Excuse me. I'm the executive,
you're the office equipment.

708
00:52:49,210 --> 00:52:52,422
If I want to ask
the office equipment for advice,

709
00:52:52,714 --> 00:52:54,924
I'll ask the water cooler!

710
00:52:55,216 --> 00:52:57,886
Ladies and gentlemen,
the B.C.-52's!

711
00:53:01,222 --> 00:53:04,476
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, hey

712
00:53:08,229 --> 00:53:09,606
Twitch

713
00:53:11,733 --> 00:53:14,652
Well, I know a place
where the hipsters go

714
00:53:14,736 --> 00:53:17,113
Called Bedrock
Twitch, twitch

715
00:53:31,252 --> 00:53:34,172
Oh, the Stone Age crowd
is twitching proud

716
00:53:34,756 --> 00:53:36,966
In Bedrock
Twitch, twitch

717
00:53:38,259 --> 00:53:41,179
They do the twitch
Twitch, twitch, come on

718
00:53:50,397 --> 00:53:52,107
Twitch, twitch

719
00:53:53,775 --> 00:53:55,485
Twitch, twitch

720
00:53:57,278 --> 00:53:58,988
Twitch, twitch

721
00:54:00,281 --> 00:54:01,991
Twitch, twitch

722
00:54:05,787 --> 00:54:08,623
Do it, come on, baby
Do it, do it, do it

723
00:54:08,790 --> 00:54:12,544
- Do the twitch
like you got an itch, itch
- Yeah, yeah, yeah

724
00:54:12,794 --> 00:54:15,755
- Itch, itch, itch, itch
- Yeah, yeah, yeah

725
00:54:16,297 --> 00:54:18,550
Twitch
Thank you, Bedrock!

726
00:54:19,801 --> 00:54:23,263
Thanks, everybody.
And remember, don't drink and pedal.

727
00:54:23,304 --> 00:54:24,889
Good night!

728
00:54:28,309 --> 00:54:32,814
- How 'bout a spin, Betty?
- No, thank you, Fred.
I'll wait till Barney gets here.

729
00:54:32,814 --> 00:54:35,817
He started some new job today.
I'm not sure what time he gets done.

730
00:54:35,817 --> 00:54:39,946
While we're waiting, how about another
carafe of the bubbly? Garcon! Whoops.

731
00:54:39,946 --> 00:54:42,323
Don't worry, Mr. Flintstone.
I'll have that taken care of right away.

732
00:54:42,323 --> 00:54:44,284
Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh.

733
00:54:46,828 --> 00:54:48,747
Table seven, sonny.

734
00:54:54,836 --> 00:54:56,254
Barney!

735
00:54:56,838 --> 00:54:59,924
Barney, nice skins!
Sit down, take a load off!

736
00:55:00,342 --> 00:55:03,720
- I can't, Fred. I'm working here.
- You're a busboy?

737
00:55:04,846 --> 00:55:08,933
- It's honest work.
- Yeah, I don't have to
fight Dino for my supper.

738
00:55:09,851 --> 00:55:13,646
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'll get you a fresh tablecloth, sir.

739
00:55:16,858 --> 00:55:21,446
Wilma, you were worried
he'd never find a job and
we'd be stuck with him forever.

740
00:55:23,365 --> 00:55:24,616
Ow!

741
00:55:29,371 --> 00:55:32,332
Flintstone! Flintstone!
We want Flintstone!

742
00:55:33,875 --> 00:55:37,754
The demonstration continues
to get uglier at Slate and Company...

743
00:55:37,879 --> 00:55:41,966
following the unexpected layoff
of virtually the entire labor force...

744
00:55:42,884 --> 00:55:45,011
by V.P. Fred Flintstone.

745
00:55:45,387 --> 00:55:48,473
For the Cave News Network,
this is Susan Rock.

746
00:55:48,515 --> 00:55:50,392
Fred, did you hear what happened
to everyone at the quarry today?

747
00:55:50,392 --> 00:55:54,354
Yup. A few hours ago, I sent them
all off on a nice, long vacation.

748
00:55:54,396 --> 00:55:57,399
You mean, a permanent vacation.
He fired them!

749
00:55:57,399 --> 00:55:59,359
Fred! How could you?

750
00:55:59,526 --> 00:56:02,404
- I didn't do that.
- You did too! It's all over the TV!

751
00:56:02,404 --> 00:56:06,074
- Fred!
- Who are you going to believe..
me or some busboy?

752
00:56:06,908 --> 00:56:09,411
That busboy is
your best friend!

753
00:56:09,911 --> 00:56:13,790
Best friend? I lost my best friend
the day I became an executive!

754
00:56:13,915 --> 00:56:16,918
He's just jealous
of my hard-earned success.

755
00:56:17,043 --> 00:56:20,338
Hard-earned?
Tell me something, Mr. Vice President,

756
00:56:20,922 --> 00:56:23,717
what's a graduated
inventory plan, huh?

757
00:56:23,925 --> 00:56:25,927
How about supply and demand?

758
00:56:25,927 --> 00:56:28,346
Hey, Fred!
What's two and two?

759
00:56:29,431 --> 00:56:33,018
I didn't come here to talk business.
I'm out with my wife.

760
00:56:33,935 --> 00:56:36,146
Now, get me a clean spoon.

761
00:56:36,438 --> 00:56:38,106
That does it!

762
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:42,986
The only reason you got that job is
'cause I switched tests with you.

763
00:56:44,070 --> 00:56:46,823
- Oh, Barney.
- Oh-ho-ho, that's rich!

764
00:56:47,949 --> 00:56:52,454
What good would it do me to switch tests
with the guy that got the lowest score?

765
00:56:53,455 --> 00:56:57,000
- Think about it, Fred.
- Oh, finally it all makes sense.

766
00:56:58,585 --> 00:57:00,962
You don't believe this,
do you?

767
00:57:00,962 --> 00:57:04,799
- Are you calling my husband a liar?
- This has gone far enough.

768
00:57:04,966 --> 00:57:08,970
After everything that we've done
for you. We took you into our home.

769
00:57:09,971 --> 00:57:13,183
Yeah? So you could show off
every chance you got!

770
00:57:13,475 --> 00:57:15,977
You used to be such
nice people, but now...

771
00:57:15,977 --> 00:57:18,605
you're just a couple of
rich snobs!

772
00:57:19,981 --> 00:57:22,984
Better than being
a couple of petty ingrates.

773
00:57:22,984 --> 00:57:26,071
Come on, Barney.
We are moving out... tonight!

774
00:57:26,488 --> 00:57:29,240
Hang on, Betty.
I forgot to punch out.

775
00:57:51,513 --> 00:57:53,390
Eh, put it up top.

776
00:57:54,516 --> 00:57:57,102
Betty, please.
We can work it out.

777
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:00,980
We're all civilized people here.

778
00:58:01,022 --> 00:58:03,024
It's too late, Wilma.

779
00:58:03,525 --> 00:58:06,695
Come on, we all said things
that we didn't mean.

780
00:58:07,529 --> 00:58:09,447
Speak for yourself.

781
00:58:09,531 --> 00:58:11,533
Come on, Betty.
Time to hit the road.

782
00:58:11,533 --> 00:58:14,452
Fred! Aren't you even
the least bit sorry?

783
00:58:16,037 --> 00:58:19,582
Sure, I'm sorry. I'm sorry
I ever met the little moocher.

784
00:58:21,543 --> 00:58:23,086
Oh, Betty.

785
00:58:23,545 --> 00:58:25,714
- Good-bye, Wilma.
- Oh.

786
00:58:48,069 --> 00:58:49,738
They're gone.

787
00:58:55,076 --> 00:58:58,621
I cannot believe you just let them
walk out of our lives.

788
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:04,085
- At least I can walk around
the house in my underwear again.
- And that is more important...

789
00:59:04,085 --> 00:59:06,087
than 20 years of friendship?

790
00:59:06,087 --> 00:59:08,006
It is on a hot day.

791
00:59:08,089 --> 00:59:10,592
They were holding us back, Wilma.

792
00:59:11,092 --> 00:59:14,971
We'll make new friends. There's
4,000 other people in this world!

793
00:59:15,597 --> 00:59:18,099
- Who needs the Rubbles?
- I do.

794
00:59:19,225 --> 00:59:21,895
But I'll tell you
what I don't need.

795
00:59:22,103 --> 00:59:24,522
I don't need...
this necklace.

796
00:59:27,108 --> 00:59:29,611
You know, I don't need this lamp.

797
00:59:30,111 --> 00:59:32,822
And I don't need
this television set.

798
00:59:34,616 --> 00:59:36,201
Not the TV!

799
00:59:37,619 --> 00:59:39,496
I don't need this.

800
00:59:40,121 --> 00:59:41,998
I don't need this.

801
00:59:42,123 --> 00:59:45,502
I don't think I'll be needing
any of this bone china.

802
00:59:47,128 --> 00:59:50,507
Because I don't have
any friends to invite to dinner.

803
00:59:51,132 --> 00:59:54,678
I don't think I'll be using
any of these cups or saucers.

804
00:59:55,762 --> 01:00:00,016
You're gonna regret this. It's gonna
take you hours to clean up this mess.

805
01:00:09,651 --> 01:00:12,529
All right, Wilma.
Enough of this charade.

806
01:00:12,654 --> 01:00:15,281
Come back now,
and I'll forgive ya.

807
01:00:16,282 --> 01:00:19,035
Oh, you're bluffin',
Wilma Slaghoople.

808
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:21,663
You're not going
to your mother's.

809
01:00:21,663 --> 01:00:24,165
Once around the block,
you'll realize...

810
01:00:24,165 --> 01:00:27,544
the folly of your ways and
you'll come crawling back.

811
01:00:31,172 --> 01:00:32,590
Please.

812
01:01:00,702 --> 01:01:03,747
It's finally happened:
I've become my father.

813
01:01:04,706 --> 01:01:07,208
Now, Barney,
don't talk like that.

814
01:01:07,208 --> 01:01:10,211
- This place is fine for now.
- Come on, Betty.

815
01:01:10,211 --> 01:01:13,465
We're living downwind
from a family of wild boars.

816
01:01:13,715 --> 01:01:16,551
- Face it. We've hit rock bottom.
- Hmm.

817
01:01:19,220 --> 01:01:21,264
Come here, little guy.

818
01:01:22,724 --> 01:01:25,101
Can you say da-da?
Say da-da.

819
01:01:25,727 --> 01:01:27,645
- Bamm-Bamm!
- Oh.

820
01:01:28,730 --> 01:01:32,233
It doesn't really matter where we live,
as long as we're together.

821
01:01:32,233 --> 01:01:33,818
Family hug!

822
01:01:42,869 --> 01:01:44,662
- Betty?
- Hmm?

823
01:01:44,871 --> 01:01:47,582
Exactly where did you
get those eggs?

824
01:01:51,878 --> 01:01:53,254
Sorry.

825
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:56,091
I think it might be twins.

826
01:02:03,390 --> 01:02:05,016
There he is!

827
01:02:08,395 --> 01:02:10,730
You're a traitor, Flintstone!

828
01:02:10,897 --> 01:02:14,401
- Listen to me. I'm your friend.
- You're no friend of ours!

829
01:02:14,401 --> 01:02:16,820
And you're a rotten bowler too!

830
01:02:29,416 --> 01:02:31,584
Good morning, Mr. Flint..

831
01:02:43,430 --> 01:02:46,933
- They made a fool of me.
- Look what they had to work with.

832
01:02:46,933 --> 01:02:48,226
Wah!

833
01:02:49,936 --> 01:02:52,939
Flintstone, heard you were down
in the file room.

834
01:02:52,939 --> 01:02:54,441
Find anything interesting?

835
01:02:54,441 --> 01:02:56,985
Yeah! I'm on to
your little scam.

836
01:02:57,444 --> 01:02:59,946
Billing phony companies
and keeping the money for yourself.

837
01:02:59,946 --> 01:03:02,699
- I'm going to Mr. Slate.
- Good idea.

838
01:03:02,949 --> 01:03:05,952
Turning yourself in might
buy you a little leniency.

839
01:03:05,952 --> 01:03:09,080
- Me? This entire scheme was your idea.
- True.

840
01:03:09,581 --> 01:03:12,459
But I've graciously decided
to give you all the credit...

841
01:03:12,459 --> 01:03:14,461
since it's your name
on the requisitions.

842
01:03:14,461 --> 01:03:16,463
I never touched
any of that money!

843
01:03:16,463 --> 01:03:18,340
Hmm. Fred, please.

844
01:03:19,466 --> 01:03:23,511
Remodeling your house, furs, jewelry,
a fully-equipped Le Sabertooth.

845
01:03:23,970 --> 01:03:28,016
- Tsk, tsk, tsk.
You should have been more discreet.
- I'm innocent!

846
01:03:28,099 --> 01:03:31,061
Oh, boo-hoo-hoo.
Miss Stone, call security.

847
01:03:31,478 --> 01:03:34,105
Tell them we've
uncovered an embezzler.

848
01:03:34,105 --> 01:03:36,941
Miss Stone,
you'll back me up, won't ya?

849
01:03:38,985 --> 01:03:42,030
You better run while
you still have a chance.

850
01:03:43,990 --> 01:03:45,992
You'll never get away with this.

851
01:03:45,992 --> 01:03:47,744
I already have.

852
01:04:02,133 --> 01:04:04,386
Here comes the pterodactyl.

853
01:04:08,014 --> 01:04:10,725
- Mmm-mmm-mmm.
- It's no use, Mother.

854
01:04:12,018 --> 01:04:13,812
She misses Fred.

855
01:04:15,522 --> 01:04:18,525
I hope it's not that
pesky Avrok lady again.

856
01:04:18,525 --> 01:04:19,776
Oh!

857
01:04:21,528 --> 01:04:23,279
- Betty!
- Oh.

858
01:04:23,530 --> 01:04:26,408
- Bamm-Bamm!
- I have missed you so much.

859
01:04:26,533 --> 01:04:30,704
I don't care what Barney said; l
couldn't let you go through this alone.

860
01:04:31,538 --> 01:04:34,082
- Have you heard from Fred?
- No.

861
01:04:38,670 --> 01:04:40,547
I spoke to a lawyer.

862
01:04:40,547 --> 01:04:43,591
If he's missing seven years,
you can remarry.

863
01:04:44,050 --> 01:04:45,468
Mother!

864
01:04:47,053 --> 01:04:50,598
Well, wherever Fred is,
I hope he knows I still love him.

865
01:04:52,058 --> 01:04:53,351
Ohh.

866
01:04:54,060 --> 01:04:57,105
Calling all Bedrock units,
all Bedrock units.

867
01:05:09,075 --> 01:05:12,078
Tonight, in a special edition
of Bedrock's Most Wanted,

868
01:05:12,078 --> 01:05:15,081
we bring you the story
that's rocked our city,

869
01:05:15,081 --> 01:05:17,959
"The Case Of The
Embezzling Executive".

870
01:05:21,588 --> 01:05:24,090
Mr. Flintstone,
what are you doing?

871
01:05:24,090 --> 01:05:26,634
I'm an executive.
I'm embezzling.

872
01:05:28,094 --> 01:05:29,721
I'm shocked!

873
01:05:30,096 --> 01:05:32,682
How could you ever
marry that man?

874
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:36,227
Mother!
That man is not my husband.

875
01:05:37,103 --> 01:05:40,607
That's right. He plays Dr. Gravelman
on The Young And The Thumbless.

876
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:44,110
Fred might be a lot of things
but a thief is not one of them.

877
01:05:44,110 --> 01:05:46,613
- Can you prove it?
- Who cares?

878
01:05:46,613 --> 01:05:48,490
Yabba-dabba-dabba!

879
01:05:49,115 --> 01:05:52,118
- Yabba-dabba-dabba!
- This menace remains at large..

880
01:05:52,118 --> 01:05:55,789
- We ask the public's help
in apprehending..
- Maybe I can.

881
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:17,435
A little something to take that
chill off. Take a swig of this.

882
01:06:17,644 --> 01:06:19,854
Put hair on your knuckles.

883
01:06:21,648 --> 01:06:25,652
Tell me something..
You one of those guys that was
laid off at the stone quarry?

884
01:06:25,652 --> 01:06:27,654
I used to work there.

885
01:06:27,654 --> 01:06:32,659
A lot of guys here would like
to get their hands on the guy
who's responsible for all this.

886
01:06:33,159 --> 01:06:37,455
- So they could hear
his side of the story?
- What? His side of the story?

887
01:06:42,168 --> 01:06:43,962
Huh? Flintstone!

888
01:06:44,671 --> 01:06:46,256
Flintstone!

889
01:06:51,177 --> 01:06:53,054
It is! Flintstone!

890
01:06:57,684 --> 01:06:59,185
Squealer!

891
01:07:00,687 --> 01:07:02,147
Get him!

892
01:07:07,694 --> 01:07:11,906
Just think. This time tomorrow, we'll
be on a pterodactyl winging our w..

893
01:07:13,199 --> 01:07:15,160
- Oh, Cliff.
- Hmm?

894
01:07:16,202 --> 01:07:19,289
How come there's only
one ticket to Rocapulco?

895
01:07:22,208 --> 01:07:26,713
For your protection, darling.
I thought I would go on
a "business trip," while you...

896
01:07:26,713 --> 01:07:28,715
stay here to keep up appearances.

897
01:07:28,715 --> 01:07:32,010
Then, when we're sure it's safe,
I'll send for you.

898
01:07:32,719 --> 01:07:34,596
Forgive me, Cliff.

899
01:07:36,723 --> 01:07:39,559
Looks like you've
thought of everything.

900
01:07:51,738 --> 01:07:53,531
Psst. Excuse me!

901
01:07:57,243 --> 01:08:00,622
- Hello.
- No, Mumsie, I don't want
to go to school.

902
01:08:00,747 --> 01:08:03,124
The other boys make fun of me.

903
01:08:03,750 --> 01:08:05,210
Wake up!

904
01:08:06,252 --> 01:08:10,131
Oh, Mrs. Flintstone. To what do
I owe the honor of this break-in?

905
01:08:11,257 --> 01:08:13,510
I need your help, Mr. Bird.

906
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:16,888
- You hear everything that
goes on in this office.
- Mm-hmm.

907
01:08:16,888 --> 01:08:20,183
You are the only one who can help
clear my husband.

908
01:08:20,392 --> 01:08:24,270
My, my, what a delicious irony.
Thank you for sharing it with me.

909
01:08:24,771 --> 01:08:27,482
Now, let me share
something with you.

910
01:08:30,276 --> 01:08:32,487
Oh, now, Wilma, calm down.

911
01:08:32,779 --> 01:08:35,448
- Maybe I can reason with him.
- Ow!

912
01:08:37,283 --> 01:08:39,035
There. All set.

913
01:08:40,787 --> 01:08:43,957
You know, my only regret
is I won't be around...

914
01:08:44,791 --> 01:08:48,670
when that shoddy new equipment
blows up in their big, dumb faces.

915
01:08:49,796 --> 01:08:53,591
Oh, well, I'll just have to
console myself with all that money.

916
01:08:55,301 --> 01:08:57,095
Hey, who's that?

917
01:09:02,308 --> 01:09:04,477
That's Flintstone's wife.

918
01:09:06,312 --> 01:09:09,315
What would she want with
a stinky old dict..

919
01:09:09,315 --> 01:09:11,401
Son of a brachiosaurus!

920
01:09:12,318 --> 01:09:15,780
Well, Cliff. I guess you haven't
thought of everything.

921
01:09:17,824 --> 01:09:20,035
Oh, this is far from over.

922
01:09:28,335 --> 01:09:30,045
String him up!

923
01:09:30,337 --> 01:09:32,839
You can't do this.
I was framed!

924
01:09:32,839 --> 01:09:35,550
In a minute you're
going to be boxed.

925
01:09:41,348 --> 01:09:43,350
Anybody want a snowcone?

926
01:09:43,350 --> 01:09:45,226
- Barney!
- Fred!

927
01:09:46,353 --> 01:09:48,855
- What are you doing here?
- I'm getting lynched!

928
01:09:48,855 --> 01:09:52,567
- Oh. I got cherry, lime, rocky road.
- Do you know this guy?

929
01:09:54,361 --> 01:09:57,155
Know him?
He used to be my best friend.

930
01:09:58,365 --> 01:10:02,494
In a way, if it wasn't for me,
this whole mess probably
wouldn't have happened.

931
01:10:02,494 --> 01:10:06,456
Thanks for filling us in. We could've
made a very big mistake here.

932
01:10:08,375 --> 01:10:10,669
- Hang both of 'em.
- What?

933
01:10:10,877 --> 01:10:14,506
Gee, take it easy. They make you pay
for your own uniforms.

934
01:10:15,882 --> 01:10:18,635
Barney, I thought
you came to save me.

935
01:10:18,885 --> 01:10:22,555
Save you? I saw a crowd,
I figured I'd sell a few snowcones.

936
01:10:23,390 --> 01:10:26,393
- You mean you haven't forgiven me yet?
- Nope.

937
01:10:26,393 --> 01:10:28,895
Frankly, I don't think
this is going to help.

938
01:10:28,895 --> 01:10:31,398
- I took a cherry.
- I can't break a 20.

939
01:10:31,398 --> 01:10:33,775
Hey, hey, hey!
Wait a minute!

940
01:10:34,401 --> 01:10:37,696
Look, Barn, I know you're still
a little mad at me.

941
01:10:38,405 --> 01:10:42,409
But I want you to know, if I had
to have someone hanging next to me,

942
01:10:43,410 --> 01:10:45,286
I'm glad it's you.

943
01:10:47,914 --> 01:10:51,918
I guess switchin' them tests didn't turn
out much like I planned, huh, Fred?

944
01:10:51,918 --> 01:10:53,837
Hey, got any lemon?

945
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:55,797
Check in the back.

946
01:10:55,922 --> 01:10:59,050
Gee, why can't business
be this good every day?

947
01:10:59,426 --> 01:11:01,428
The story of my life.

948
01:11:02,429 --> 01:11:04,931
- I'm a loser.
- No, you're not.

949
01:11:05,432 --> 01:11:09,436
- This makes me a winner?
- No, but you're the best friend
a guy ever had...

950
01:11:09,436 --> 01:11:12,439
and that makes you a winner
in my book, pal.

951
01:11:12,439 --> 01:11:14,607
Me.. I'm just a big jerk.

952
01:11:18,445 --> 01:11:20,822
Ah, everybody loves you, Fred.

953
01:11:20,947 --> 01:11:23,074
Except for this lynch mob.

954
01:11:23,074 --> 01:11:24,576
Ah, Barn.

955
01:11:25,452 --> 01:11:26,953
Ah, Fred.

956
01:11:31,958 --> 01:11:35,295
You'll have plenty of time
to bond in the afterlife.

957
01:11:38,465 --> 01:11:40,091
Wilma, look!

958
01:11:43,970 --> 01:11:46,097
Watch out for that tree!

959
01:11:51,978 --> 01:11:53,938
Now wait, everybody.

960
01:11:56,483 --> 01:11:58,318
Fred is innocent.

961
01:12:00,445 --> 01:12:03,448
Barney, do you have to do
everything Fred does?

962
01:12:03,448 --> 01:12:05,617
Everybody, listen to him.

963
01:12:06,451 --> 01:12:09,287
First things first.
I demand an apology.

964
01:12:11,456 --> 01:12:13,792
- I'm sorry!
- Not you, him.

965
01:12:15,460 --> 01:12:17,587
Me? Apologize to a bird?

966
01:12:18,963 --> 01:12:20,924
Not Fred Flintstone!

967
01:12:21,966 --> 01:12:24,469
I had hoped we might be colleagues
but instead, you've treated me as if...

968
01:12:24,469 --> 01:12:27,472
I were an ordinary
piece of office furniture.

969
01:12:27,472 --> 01:12:29,974
I may eat bugs, but I have
feelings, Mr. Flintstone.

970
01:12:29,974 --> 01:12:32,394
- And you've hurt them.
- Aww.

971
01:12:35,980 --> 01:12:39,776
Uh, well, look, I know I could've
been a little more sensitive.

972
01:12:40,985 --> 01:12:43,905
- Especially when you were molting.
- Ohh.

973
01:12:43,988 --> 01:12:45,824
So, I'm... sorry.

974
01:12:46,491 --> 01:12:49,369
I don't think
they heard you in the back.

975
01:12:49,494 --> 01:12:51,579
- I'm sorry.
- Pardon?

976
01:12:52,997 --> 01:12:55,417
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
- Ohh.

977
01:12:56,626 --> 01:12:58,169
Now, then.

978
01:12:59,004 --> 01:13:03,341
Gather 'round, everyone. I'll tell you
the tale of an unsophisticated man...

979
01:13:04,009 --> 01:13:06,845
caught up in
a treacherous web of power,

980
01:13:07,012 --> 01:13:08,805
deceit and lust.

981
01:13:09,514 --> 01:13:11,057
Ooh, yeah.

982
01:13:13,018 --> 01:13:15,020
Why is the door open?

983
01:13:18,023 --> 01:13:21,443
- Betty, the door is open!
- Wilma, something's wrong!

984
01:13:26,531 --> 01:13:28,658
- Pebbles!
- Bamm-Bamm!

985
01:13:32,037 --> 01:13:35,248
What kind of madman would
do something like this?

986
01:13:40,545 --> 01:13:42,547
That's a poor poochie.

987
01:13:42,547 --> 01:13:44,883
That's a baby. That's a baby.

988
01:13:51,556 --> 01:13:54,851
- Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm are gone!
- They left this.

989
01:13:55,685 --> 01:13:58,563
- It's a note.
- "If you want to see your kids again,

990
01:13:58,563 --> 01:14:02,025
bring the Dictabird to the quarry
at dawn. No police".

991
01:14:17,082 --> 01:14:18,833
Mr. Flintstone.

992
01:14:20,210 --> 01:14:23,421
Stealing office equipment, really.
Tsk, tsk, tsk. 

993
01:14:23,588 --> 01:14:27,342
Is this the kind of example you want
to set for your daughter?

994
01:14:27,592 --> 01:14:30,470
- Where are the kids?
- The bird, please.

995
01:14:32,597 --> 01:14:35,558
- First, we want our children.
- Of course.

996
01:14:39,604 --> 01:14:42,107
- Bamm-Bamm!
- Take one more step, Mr. Rubble,

997
01:14:42,107 --> 01:14:45,735
and this quarry's safety record
will be severely tarnished.

998
01:14:46,236 --> 01:14:48,279
Now, give me the bird.

999
01:14:48,613 --> 01:14:51,282
Go on, Fred.
Give him what he wants.

1000
01:14:51,741 --> 01:14:54,411
- What?
- Don't worry, I got a plan.

1001
01:14:54,619 --> 01:14:59,124
- We're gonna get the kids back
and then we'll rescue you.
- What a strategist.

1002
01:15:01,126 --> 01:15:03,628
I should have signed
with Disney.

1003
01:15:03,628 --> 01:15:07,173
They never would've allowed this sort
of thing to happen.

1004
01:15:10,635 --> 01:15:13,263
- Ahh! Thank you, gentlemen.
- Easy.

1005
01:15:13,263 --> 01:15:16,016
And in the words of
my beloved mother,

1006
01:15:16,766 --> 01:15:20,103
I'm taking the money and moving
to a warmer climate.

1007
01:15:28,653 --> 01:15:30,280
Help, Daddy!

1008
01:15:37,162 --> 01:15:40,331
Let's discuss this, Cliff.
May I call you Cliff?

1009
01:15:40,665 --> 01:15:42,876
Barney, too much pressure.

1010
01:15:50,675 --> 01:15:52,510
One, two, three..

1011
01:15:55,680 --> 01:15:57,265
Nice goin'.

1012
01:15:58,183 --> 01:16:02,062
- Now what do we do?
- You get the kids,
I'll try and stop this.

1013
01:16:25,710 --> 01:16:27,045
Whoa!

1014
01:16:36,721 --> 01:16:40,558
Cliffy, have I ever told you you have
a very distinguished chin?

1015
01:16:40,725 --> 01:16:42,394
Shut up! Aah!

1016
01:16:48,233 --> 01:16:49,567
Whoa!

1017
01:16:51,236 --> 01:16:53,154
Yo, ow, ow, ow, ow!

1018
01:16:56,783 --> 01:16:58,702
Oh, dear, oh, dear.

1019
01:16:59,244 --> 01:17:02,288
Too many years behind a desk.
Mayday, mayday!

1020
01:17:07,752 --> 01:17:09,295
Hi, Da-da.

1021
01:17:11,756 --> 01:17:14,259
You did it!
You called me da-da!

1022
01:17:16,261 --> 01:17:18,430
Oh, Barney, you lunkhead!

1023
01:17:30,525 --> 01:17:33,778
What am I going to do?
I gotta think of somethin'.

1024
01:17:39,284 --> 01:17:40,744
Not now.

1025
01:17:47,792 --> 01:17:49,836
Wake up, Uncle Barney!

1026
01:17:53,298 --> 01:17:54,883
Help, help!

1027
01:17:55,300 --> 01:17:58,053
Save me!
Save me from this mad M.B.A.!

1028
01:17:59,304 --> 01:18:02,474
- Don't worry. I'll take care of him.
- My hero.

1029
01:18:05,810 --> 01:18:07,187
Yipes.

1030
01:18:07,812 --> 01:18:10,482
Flintstone,
kiss your bird good-bye.

1031
01:18:13,318 --> 01:18:14,819
Oh, mama.

1032
01:18:21,326 --> 01:18:23,828
Will there be anything else,
Mr. Flintstone?

1033
01:18:23,828 --> 01:18:26,873
No, Miss Stone.
Take the rest of the day off.

1034
01:19:00,365 --> 01:19:02,158
Yabba-dabba-doo!

1035
01:19:08,873 --> 01:19:10,250
Cliff?

1036
01:19:10,875 --> 01:19:13,628
It's time for you and me
to interface.

1037
01:19:30,020 --> 01:19:31,980
- Aah!
- Stee-rike!

1038
01:19:54,794 --> 01:19:56,421
And then, Cliff said,

1039
01:19:56,421 --> 01:19:59,924
"True. But I've graciously decided
to give you all the credit,

1040
01:19:59,924 --> 01:20:03,261
since it's your name on all
the requisition forms".

1041
01:20:06,431 --> 01:20:09,351
Mr. Flintstone,
I may not be in on Monday.

1042
01:20:10,060 --> 01:20:12,437
Don't worry, Miss Stone.
I'll tell 'em what you did.

1043
01:20:12,437 --> 01:20:16,316
- I'm sure they'll let you off easy.
- I've been a very bad girl.

1044
01:20:16,441 --> 01:20:18,485
But you have to admit,

1045
01:20:18,943 --> 01:20:21,279
I was very,
very good at it.

1046
01:20:26,576 --> 01:20:28,953
Come on, do it for Mommy.
Who am l?

1047
01:20:28,953 --> 01:20:30,872
- Bamm-Bamm!
- Oh.

1048
01:20:34,459 --> 01:20:36,461
Thank goodness,
you're all right.

1049
01:20:36,461 --> 01:20:40,465
Well, I'm not going to jail, but
it won't be easy getting a new job.

1050
01:20:40,965 --> 01:20:44,469
What kind of reference
is Mr. Slate gonna give me
after I destroyed his quarry?

1051
01:20:44,469 --> 01:20:47,931
None of this was your fault.
Mr. Slate will understand.

1052
01:20:47,972 --> 01:20:49,557
Flintstone!

1053
01:20:50,475 --> 01:20:52,977
Sure, now he gets
my name right.

1054
01:20:52,977 --> 01:20:54,938
How did this happen?

1055
01:20:55,980 --> 01:20:59,984
Mr. Slate, it all started when
the Rubbles here wanted to adopt a baby.

1056
01:20:59,984 --> 01:21:01,486
Not that!

1057
01:21:02,987 --> 01:21:05,365
How did this
happen to Cliff?

1058
01:21:06,491 --> 01:21:08,660
Well, you see, Mr. Slate,

1059
01:21:08,993 --> 01:21:11,496
the machinery went haywire
and the rocks got all crushed up...

1060
01:21:11,496 --> 01:21:13,998
and that got mixed in with water
and that came all down the hill.

1061
01:21:13,998 --> 01:21:17,293
- Mr. Slate, I'm sorry!
- Sorry? I love this stuff!

1062
01:21:19,004 --> 01:21:22,090
I'm gonna name it after
my daughter Concretia.

1063
01:21:24,009 --> 01:21:26,302
Flintstone, you're a genius!

1064
01:21:27,512 --> 01:21:29,305
Me? Really? Why?

1065
01:21:30,807 --> 01:21:34,853
Don't you see? Thanks to concrete,
man can now shape his own destiny.

1066
01:21:35,812 --> 01:21:38,273
- The Stone Age is over!
- Ahh.

1067
01:21:38,314 --> 01:21:42,027
First thing, I want you
to hire back all the men, Flintstone.

1068
01:21:42,318 --> 01:21:44,821
- We're going into
production immediately.
- We?

1069
01:21:44,821 --> 01:21:49,325
That's right.
You are hereby promoted to President
of the entire Concrete Division.

1070
01:21:49,325 --> 01:21:50,744
Yabba..

1071
01:21:57,334 --> 01:22:01,963
That's a real nice offer,
Mr. Slate, but unfortunately,
I'm gonna have to turn you down.

1072
01:22:01,963 --> 01:22:06,343
Don't listen to him, Mr. Slate.
Fred, it's a great job!
This time, you deserve it.

1073
01:22:06,343 --> 01:22:09,346
Barney, all my life
I wanted to be a somebody.

1074
01:22:09,346 --> 01:22:12,474
And when I finally did,
I turned into somebody I didn't like.

1075
01:22:12,474 --> 01:22:15,352
Good grief, man,
have you lost your mind?

1076
01:22:15,852 --> 01:22:18,355
This could make you rich
beyond your wildest dreams.

1077
01:22:18,355 --> 01:22:21,274
I was always the richest man
in the world.

1078
01:22:21,858 --> 01:22:23,860
I just never knew it.

1079
01:22:24,361 --> 01:22:26,363
So, if it's okay with you,
Mr. Slate,

1080
01:22:26,363 --> 01:22:29,449
all I want is my old job back
and my old life.

1081
01:22:29,991 --> 01:22:31,326
Fred.

1082
01:22:33,370 --> 01:22:35,872
And two weeks paid vacation
for all the men in the quarry,

1083
01:22:35,872 --> 01:22:38,375
an annual cost
of livin' increase...

1084
01:22:38,375 --> 01:22:41,378
and those little packets
of ketchup in the lunchroom.

1085
01:22:41,378 --> 01:22:44,839
- Done!
- Thanks, boss.
See you at the company picnic.

1086
01:22:46,883 --> 01:22:49,761
There goes the best
executive I ever had.

1087
01:22:51,388 --> 01:22:53,890
- Fred, I'm so proud of you.
- And I'm proud of you, Barney.

1088
01:22:53,890 --> 01:22:55,892
- I'm starving!
- Me too!

1089
01:22:55,892 --> 01:22:59,896
What do you say we get some breakfast.
Snake and eggs for everybody.

1090
01:22:59,896 --> 01:23:02,273
- My treat. Barney..
- Great.

1091
01:23:02,399 --> 01:23:06,486
- Yeah, Fred?
- Could you spot me a couple bucks?
I'm a little short.

1092
01:23:08,405 --> 01:23:10,573
- Not this time!
- What?

1093
01:23:29,926 --> 01:23:32,429
Flintstones
Meet the Flintstones

1094
01:23:32,429 --> 01:23:34,973
They're a modern
Stone Age family

1095
01:23:36,933 --> 01:23:39,060
From the
town of Bedrock

1096
01:23:39,060 --> 01:23:41,688
They're a page
right out of history

1097
01:23:44,441 --> 01:23:47,152
Someday maybe
Fred will win the fight

1098
01:23:47,444 --> 01:23:49,946
Then that cat will
stay out for the night

1099
01:23:49,946 --> 01:23:52,449
When you're
with the Flintstones

1100
01:23:52,449 --> 01:23:55,452
Have a yabba-dabba-doo time
A dabba-doo time

1101
01:23:56,453 --> 01:23:58,621
We'll have a gay old time

1102
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:06,629
- Wilma!
- We'll have a gay old time

1103
01:24:08,965 --> 01:24:10,342
Wilma!

1104
01:24:18,475 --> 01:24:20,268
Yabba-dabba-doo!

1105
01:24:28,485 --> 01:24:30,987
Flintstones
Meet the Flintstones

1106
01:24:30,987 --> 01:24:33,615
They're the modern
Stone Age family

1107
01:24:34,991 --> 01:24:37,160
From the
town of Bedrock

1108
01:24:37,994 --> 01:24:40,622
They're a page
right out of history

1109
01:24:41,998 --> 01:24:44,918
Let's ride with
the family down the street

1110
01:24:45,502 --> 01:24:48,296
Through the courtesy
of Fred's two feet

1111
01:24:49,005 --> 01:24:51,508
When you're
with the Flintstones

1112
01:24:51,508 --> 01:24:54,511
Have a yabba-dabba-doo time
A dabba-doo time

1113
01:24:56,012 --> 01:24:58,181
We'll have a gay old time

1114
01:25:39,556 --> 01:25:41,349
The Flintstones!

1115
01:25:43,560 --> 01:25:46,062
Flintstones
Meet the Flintstones

1116
01:25:46,563 --> 01:25:49,190
They're the modern
Stone Age family

1117
01:25:50,567 --> 01:25:52,736
From the
town of Bedrock

1118
01:25:53,570 --> 01:25:56,197
They're a page
right out of history

1119
01:25:57,574 --> 01:26:00,285
Someday maybe
Fred will win the fight

1120
01:26:01,077 --> 01:26:03,955
Then that cat will
stay out for the night

1121
01:26:04,581 --> 01:26:07,083
When you're
with the Flintstones

1122
01:26:07,083 --> 01:26:10,086
Have a yabba-dabba-doo time
A dabba-doo time

1123
01:26:11,588 --> 01:26:13,757
We'll have a gay old time

1124
01:26:21,598 --> 01:26:23,767
We'll have a gay old time

1125
01:26:29,105 --> 01:26:30,440
Yeah!

1126
01:26:35,612 --> 01:26:37,405
Yabba-dabba-doo!

1127
01:26:37,614 --> 01:26:40,116
I was travelin' to Earth
and what did I spot

1128
01:26:40,116 --> 01:26:42,619
A little village by the water
Sign said Bedrock

1129
01:26:42,619 --> 01:26:45,622
I met this kid named Freddie
Didn't wear no socks

1130
01:26:45,622 --> 01:26:48,124
He had a part-time gig at
the Gravel Pit slingin' rocks

1131
01:26:48,124 --> 01:26:51,127
Said he was into hip hop, could he
kick a spell, I told him go for it

1132
01:26:51,127 --> 01:26:54,130
But at first said what you think
I said you're style is prehistoric

1133
01:26:54,130 --> 01:26:57,133
Sounds stuck in the Stone Age
You're still using a hammer and chisel

1134
01:26:57,133 --> 01:26:59,135
Carving out your lyrics
on stone pages

1135
01:26:59,135 --> 01:27:02,639
It's about time you heard a style
from a real before-the-wheel rapper

1136
01:27:02,639 --> 01:27:05,141
Set it off
and he said yabba-dabba-doo

1137
01:27:05,141 --> 01:27:07,644
Then he got the crew
The fella's suddenly standing

1138
01:27:07,644 --> 01:27:09,646
In the middle of
a crowd of K drummers

1139
01:27:09,646 --> 01:27:11,648
Sayin' tell us how you flipped
the script and ripped

1140
01:27:11,648 --> 01:27:15,151
I get busy one time
They said yeah, yeah, I'm hip, I'm hip

1141
01:27:15,151 --> 01:27:17,153
Didn't know the time
Didn't know about fly

1142
01:27:17,153 --> 01:27:20,490
So l, you know, I had to show
a Cave Man how to rock

1143
01:27:23,159 --> 01:27:24,953
In the Stone Age

1144
01:27:26,162 --> 01:27:28,164
I showed a Cave Man
how to rock

1145
01:27:28,164 --> 01:27:29,958
Yabba-dabba-doo!

1146
01:27:34,170 --> 01:27:35,964
In the Stone Age

1147
01:27:36,673 --> 01:27:38,675
I showed a Cave Man
how to rock

1148
01:27:38,675 --> 01:27:40,468
Yabba-dabba-doo!

1149
01:27:48,685 --> 01:27:51,062
Barney Rubble
Fred Flintstone

1150
01:27:55,692 --> 01:27:58,653
Hey, Freddie boy
Don't try to get too close

1151
01:27:59,195 --> 01:28:01,865
I don't want to catch
a mammoth dose

1152
01:28:05,702 --> 01:28:08,163
We'll meet at
the Bedrock disco

1153
01:28:08,705 --> 01:28:11,499
Who cares when I got T. Rex
on my radio

1154
01:28:15,211 --> 01:28:18,381
On this prehistoric day
I feel duty-bound to say

1155
01:28:20,717 --> 01:28:23,094
Before I reach
my destination

1156
01:28:25,722 --> 01:28:28,892
On this prehistoric day
I feel duty-bound to say

1157
01:28:31,227 --> 01:28:33,229
I owes an explanation

1158
01:28:35,732 --> 01:28:37,817
Give me one good reason

1159
01:28:40,737 --> 01:28:42,864
Give me two good reasons

1160
01:28:45,742 --> 01:28:47,952
Give me three good reasons

1161
01:28:49,245 --> 01:28:51,414
Why's men do what they do

1162
01:28:56,753 --> 01:28:59,923
Yabba-dabba-doo, Yabba-dabba-doo
Yabba-dabba-doo

1163
01:29:04,761 --> 01:29:06,638
Anarchy in Bedrock

1164
01:29:08,264 --> 01:29:11,184
Stop in some time
and meet Betty and Wilma

1165
01:29:11,768 --> 01:29:14,813
Try some Flint upside-down
Rubble bubble cake

1166
01:29:15,271 --> 01:29:17,524
Or just try
Fruity Pebbles

1167
01:29:18,274 --> 01:29:19,734
'Cause I

1168
01:29:21,277 --> 01:29:22,737
Wanna be

1169
01:29:24,781 --> 01:29:26,533
Fred Flintstone

1170
01:29:28,785 --> 01:29:30,745
Is this the U.S.D.A.

1171
01:29:32,288 --> 01:29:34,124
Is this Hollywood

1172
01:29:35,792 --> 01:29:37,544
Is this Bedrock

1173
01:29:39,295 --> 01:29:41,506
I thought it was Hollyrock

1174
01:29:42,799 --> 01:29:44,259
'Cause I

1175
01:29:45,301 --> 01:29:46,761
Wanna be

1176
01:29:48,805 --> 01:29:50,557
Fred Flintstone

1177
01:29:53,810 --> 01:29:55,562
Yabba-dabba-doo

1178
01:30:02,819 --> 01:30:04,195
Wilma!
