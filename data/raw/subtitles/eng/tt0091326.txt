1
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:20,621
Hey, wouldn't a fly swatter be easier?

2
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:23,957
Man who catch fly with chopstick,

3
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:26,502
accomplish anything.

4
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:31,507
- You ever catch one?
- Not yet.

5
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:59,118
What was that you were doing
on those stumps over there?

6
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:02,412
- Called Crane Technique.
- Does it work?

7
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:07,042
- If do right, no can defense.
- Could you teach me?

8
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:10,045
First learn stand, then learn fly.

9
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:13,132
Nature rule, Daniel-san. Not mine.

10
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:16,009
- Where'd you learn it from?
- Father teach.

11
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:19,429
- You must have had some father, man.
- Oh, yes.

12
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,569
"Valor. "

13
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,400
Johnny, leave him alone, man.
He's had enough!

14
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:17,070
- I'll decide when he's had enough, man.
- What is wrong with you, Johnny?

15
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:19,072
- An enemy deserves no mercy.
- Right!

16
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:20,741
- No mercy!
- Right!

17
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:22,201
You're crazy, man!

18
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:29,541
Tommy, Bobby, get him!

19
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:41,887
Mercy is for the weak.

20
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:47,267
Here, on the street, in competition,
a man confronts you, he is the enemy.

21
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:51,146
An enemy deserves no mercy.
What is the problem, Mr. Lawrence?

22
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:56,443
Come on, let's forget this.

23
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:58,904
Wait. Not yet.

24
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:03,158
Time out! Go to your sensei. Turn. Kneel.

25
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,453
Johnny, you're a cream puff!

26
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,331
Sweep the leg.

27
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,585
You have a problem with that?

28
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,005
No, Sensei.

29
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:20,634
No mercy.

30
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,445
It's over, Johnny! Yeah! You did it!

31
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,951
LaRusso, are you okay? Can you go on?

32
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:49,079
Get him a body bag! Yeah!

33
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:51,498
- All right, feet.
- Do it again, Johnny!

34
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:54,668
That's a warning
for illegal contact to the knee.

35
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:56,837
Finish it! No mercy!

36
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:59,589
No mercy! Way to finish, Johnny!

37
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:01,300
Finish him!

38
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:07,681
Fight!

39
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:12,060
Winner!

40
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:29,536
Hey, Mr. Miyagi, you know, I was thinking.

41
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,163
About what, Daniel-san?

42
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:34,333
That maybe we should have
a strategy now, you know?

43
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:35,834
For what?

44
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:38,712
My future. My whole tournament career.

45
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:40,797
Miyagi already have one.

46
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,259
Really? What is it?

47
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:46,511
Early retirement.

48
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,731
Ali and mother wait for us at restaurant.

49
00:05:57,815 --> 00:05:59,566
Yeah, I know. I'm starving.

50
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,610
- That was great. Real good.
- Thank you.

51
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,862
Danny LaRusso, very impressive win, son.

52
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:05,864
- You showed a lot of poise under pressure.
- All right. Thanks.

53
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:09,701
People are gonna be talking about
that last kick for years. Congratulations.

54
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:11,828
Out of my way!

55
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:15,082
- Hey, man, what you doing to the brother?
- Don't play with me.

56
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,125
Excuse me.

57
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:32,557
Why does he act like that?

58
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:35,102
That guy just doesn't know
what karate's all about.

59
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,521
Yeah, well, maybe he should learn.

60
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:40,357
- Would you like to teach him?
- No.

61
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:42,567
- Good luck, Daniel.
- Thanks.

62
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:44,111
- Take care.
- Thanks. Thanks a lot.

63
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:46,655
Keep ladies waiting.

64
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:50,450
- Hey, wait, wait, wait!
- What?

65
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:51,993
- Can we have your autograph?
- Can we get an autograph?

66
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,912
All right! Yeah, man!

67
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:56,248
- So, how you guys doing?
- Great.

68
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:58,458
Oh, yeah? Where are you from?

69
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,669
- Reseda.
- You're from...

70
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:03,547
I'm from Reseda.
I moved there a couple months ago.

71
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:05,090
- Maybe we'll see you sometime.
- All right.

72
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:07,092
- Daniel-san.
- What?

73
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:08,927
Come. Getting late.

74
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:11,346
It's the price of fame, Mr. Miyagi.
Gotta get used to it.

75
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:14,057
Take it easy. Maybe I'll see you.

76
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:15,892
Hey, come on. That's not fair.
I got second place.

77
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:18,311
Second place? Second place is no place!
You're off the team!

78
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:20,313
- That sucks. I did my best.
- What did you say?

79
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:23,275
- I said I did my best.
- You're nothing! You lost. You're a loser!

80
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:26,194
- No. You're the loser, man.
- I'm the loser, huh?

81
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:27,696
Yeah.

82
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:31,950
- Now who's the loser?
- You know, you're really sick, man.

83
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:34,953
- Hey!
- Hey, come on!

84
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:37,414
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Don't!

85
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:40,041
How does second place feel now, huh?

86
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,252
- Come on! He can't breathe!
- Mind your business.

87
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:44,463
- You're gonna kill him!
- Sensei, please.

88
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:47,757
You're hurting him.
He's sorry, okay? He really is.

89
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,595
- Let him go.
- Mr. Miyagi's right.

90
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:53,138
Let him go!

91
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:55,223
I say, let him go!

92
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:57,517
Beat it, slope, or you're next.

93
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,723
Mercy is for the weak.

94
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:40,018
We do not train to be merciful here.

95
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:43,188
A man face you, he is enemy.

96
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:46,566
Enemy deserve no mercy.

97
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:49,402
No.

98
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,708
Daniel-san, ladies no wait forever.

99
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:06,127
You could've killed him, couldn't you?

100
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,630
- Hai.
- Well, why didn't you then?

101
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:12,592
Because, Daniel-san, for person
with no forgiveness in heart,

102
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:16,012
living even worse punishment than death.

103
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:15,822
Oh, Daniel-san,
must have been some senior prom.

104
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:18,199
- What happened?
- You mean, what didn't happen.

105
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:21,036
First I let Ali borrow the car,
and she redesigns my fender.

106
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,706
And I don't know what she did to the engine,
but that ain't running right, either.

107
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,167
And you know what else she does?

108
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:31,254
She tells me that she's just fallen in love
with some football player from UCLA.

109
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:33,381
- Why didn't she just lie?
- Things could be worse.

110
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,467
Yeah, well, don't worry about it. They are.

111
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:39,179
Last night, I find out my mom
got picked by a company to go to Fresno.

112
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:43,475
Two months. We leave tomorrow afternoon.
I gotta spend my whole summer in Fresno.

113
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:48,063
You're not gonna be able to fix that.

114
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:52,192
How'd you do that?

115
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:54,903
What'd you do?

116
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:59,157
- Come. Miyagi tell you later.
- Where we going?

117
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:02,202
I have just the thing make you feel better.

118
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:06,498
- Probably got work for me to do.
- Hit nail on head.

119
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:09,376
Yeah, well, how come every time I have
a problem, you have work for me to do?

120
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:12,545
- Cosmic coincidence.
- When'd you build this?

121
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:15,215
Daniel-san, watch.

122
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:35,318
Come. Take offjacket. You try.

123
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:38,613
Must focus.

124
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:41,116
Concentrate.

125
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,952
Focus. Most important.

126
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:49,249
I can't, Mr. Miyagi, not today, all right?
I'm just not in the mood.

127
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:50,875
- Why?
- Because my whole life

128
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,586
is going out of focus, that's why.

129
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:58,967
When you feel life out of focus,
always return to basic of life.

130
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:02,220
What, praying?

131
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:03,722
Breathing.

132
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:06,015
No breathe, no life.

133
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,409
Come try.

134
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:34,669
Out of mouth. Breathe in through nose.

135
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,216
Breathe out of mouth.

136
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:46,347
Breathe in.

137
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:51,352
Breathe out.

138
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,151
Now how feel?

139
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:02,113
Better. More focused.

140
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:05,074
Good. Come back to work.

141
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:22,801
- Hey, I did it.
- Good focus, Daniel-san.

142
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:26,262
Remember, breathe in, breathe out.

143
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:28,431
In,

144
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:30,600
out.

145
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:32,060
In,

146
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:33,645
out.

147
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:37,649
In,

148
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:39,442
out.

149
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:52,372
Very good work.

150
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:58,044
Daniel-san.

151
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:00,255
Daniel-san!

152
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,426
Yeah. I'll be right there.

153
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:08,388
- How feel?
- Much better. Thanks.

154
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,723
What am I building out there, anyway?

155
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:13,768
- Guest room.
- You expecting company?

156
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:16,229
Refugee.

157
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:18,648
Refugee?

158
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:21,150
Oh, yeah? That's great. From where?

159
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:23,778
Fresno.

160
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:32,912
Fresno?

161
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:35,373
Miyagi talk to mother last night, too.

162
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:38,710
- And she said I could stay in here?
- If like.

163
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:41,588
- You mean I don't have to go to Fresno?
- If no want.

164
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:44,132
Oh, man, you saved my life!

165
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:47,260
Thanks! Mr. Miyagi, thanks.

166
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:50,013
Welcome.

167
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:54,100
- Iced tea.
- Oh, yeah. Oh, no, wait. Look.

168
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:57,896
I made this for you. It's rosewood.
I thought it'd be nice to show them off.

169
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:02,150
Daniel-san, thank you for gift,

170
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:04,319
but why show off?

171
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,155
Well, you know,
it says something about you,

172
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:10,909
winning the Medal of Honor and all that.
It says you're brave. I thought it'd be neat.

173
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:14,537
This say you brave.

174
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:17,540
This say you lucky.

175
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,587
- Mr. Miyagi live here?
- Excuse me.

176
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:24,422
- "Miyagi. "
- Excuse me.

177
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:28,009
Mr. Miyagi. Registered letter
for you, sir, from Okinawa.

178
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:29,844
Okinawa?

179
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,847
Yes, sir. Would you sign here, please?

180
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:38,561
Hey, this is some place you have here.
From the outside yard, you'd never know it.

181
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:41,814
You should charge admission.

182
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,525
My missus loves this stuff.

183
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:47,946
You mind if I bring her by
sometime to see it?

184
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:51,449
Some other time, maybe.

185
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:56,746
Mr. Miyagi?

186
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:07,882
What is it?

187
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,470
My father.

188
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:16,474
He very sick.

189
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,063
Your father?
I didn't even know he was still alive.

190
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:36,035
How come you can get
a passport in one day?

191
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,246
Have next-day plane ticket.

192
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:43,334
You know, you never told me. Why'd you
ever leave Okinawa in the first place?

193
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,920
Fall in love with girl.

194
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,423
So? Why'd you leave?

195
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:53,219
Was arranged by her parents
she marry someone else.

196
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:57,265
Well, did you ever meet the guy?

197
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,435
What was he like?

198
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:03,312
Was Miyagi best friend.

199
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:12,780
So this is your old girlfriend, Yukie?
She sent the letter?

200
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:16,576
And this is your buddy?

201
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:19,162
My best buddy, Sato.

202
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:23,499
- You think he's still alive?
- We were same age.

203
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,961
What did he do when
he found out about you two?

204
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:30,006
Challenge Miyagi to fight.

205
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,634
Must've been some girl.

206
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:36,054
Miyagi remember.

207
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:38,890
I make big speech

208
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:41,476
in front of whole village.

209
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:46,439
Miyagi break with tradition,
go against parent arrangement.

210
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:50,151
Marry Yukie anyway.

211
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:59,660
Of course, Sato feel disgrace.

212
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:05,208
So, challenge Miyagi to fight
to save his honor.

213
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:08,294
And you lost?

214
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,004
No.

215
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:11,714
Never fight.

216
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:15,009
Next day, leave Okinawa forever.

217
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:20,640
Well, what about her? Didn't you love her?

218
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:23,810
- Very much.
- Well, did she love you?

219
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:28,606
- So, then how could you leave?
- Miyagi no believe in fighting.

220
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:32,193
Yeah, I know that,
but you guys were in love. Come on.

221
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:37,031
Daniel-san,
never put passion before principle.

222
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:40,535
Even if win, you lose.

223
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,251
You think they got married?

224
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:51,754
Sato, his family was richest in village.

225
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:55,049
Yukie's was poorest.
Was good arrangement.

226
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:58,386
Yeah, well, it was 45 years ago.

227
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:01,055
He shouldn't be angry
about his honor anymore.

228
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,515
Daniel-san,

229
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:06,352
in Okinawa, honor have no time limit.

230
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,356
Are you serious?

231
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:15,820
In Okinawa, honor very serious.

232
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:37,008
I guess I'd better get going.
I gotta go help my mom pack.

233
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:39,343
I'll stop by tomorrow, okay, Mr. Miyagi?

234
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:43,014
Taxi leave 6:00 p. m.

235
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:46,893
- Yeah, I'll be here by then.
- Daniel-san,

236
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:51,647
Miyagi sorry things not work out.

237
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:56,277
That's no problem. I hope your dad's okay.

238
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:52,375
You're cutting it pretty close, mister.

239
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:03,219
- Go airport.
- All right.

240
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:11,852
Have a good flight. Nice to see you.

241
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:14,438
- Hello.
- Good evening.

242
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:18,943
You will be in seat 32-B.

243
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:22,029
- Enjoy the flight.
- Hey, Mr. Miyagi!

244
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:24,949
Wait up! I'm coming with you!
My mother said it's okay.

245
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:26,867
I mean, if it's okay with you.

246
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:28,953
Very expensive ticket.

247
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:32,623
Well, no, no, no. I got the money out
of my savings account. It's all taken care of.

248
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,709
Savings for college education.

249
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:37,753
So I'll get a job when we get back,
and I'll go six months late.

250
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:39,755
It really doesn't make a difference when I go.

251
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,301
- Night jobs very hard to find.
- Yeah, I know.

252
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:47,471
I mean, Mr. Miyagi,
you're more important than college.

253
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:50,057
You're more important than anything to me.
I mean...

254
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,601
When I need you,
you're always there for me.

255
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:56,647
I just... I really wanna go,
and if it's okay with you, I'd like to go.

256
00:21:58,066 --> 00:21:59,984
Daniel-san, don't think good idea.

257
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:02,653
No, no. It'll give me a chance
to study Okinawan history up close.

258
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:05,948
- Come on.
- Never know you study that.

259
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,075
I just started.

260
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:10,328
- Come on.
- We're closing the doors.

261
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:11,787
Come on. Please.

262
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:14,582
I'm afraid you'll have to go back to the gate,
young man.

263
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:19,587
Young man coming with us.

264
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:23,007
Mr. Miyagi, thank you.

265
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:26,093
No, Daniel-san. Thank you.

266
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:30,681
Hope you don't get airsick.

267
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:32,266
What do you mean "airsick"?
What's airsick?

268
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:43,778
You know the biggest U.S. air base
in the Pacific is on Okinawa?

269
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:49,950
What's the name of your village again?

270
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:52,536
Tomi Village.

271
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:55,956
I can't find it.

272
00:22:57,959 --> 00:22:59,752
Find Naha?

273
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:01,962
Yeah, I know where Naha is.

274
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,632
Go south, along the sea.

275
00:23:05,258 --> 00:23:07,051
Find Tomi Village.

276
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:09,804
I keep running into the air base.

277
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:12,139
Daniel-san,

278
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:16,018
you look again morning.
Maybe Tomi Village be there.

279
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:17,812
Get some sleep.

280
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:50,344
Mr. Miyagi?

281
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:55,182
Was Sato as good as you in karate?

282
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,519
Have same teacher.

283
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:02,314
Your father? He taught both of you?

284
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:08,112
I thought you said your family's karate
was only taught from father to son.

285
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:13,075
Miyagi ask father make exception this case.

286
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:25,337
If you fought Sato, you think
your father would have been referee?

287
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,633
No referee.

288
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:34,305
How do you know who wins?

289
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:38,559
The one who dead doesn't.

290
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:19,433
It's pretty weird having somebody
go through my stuff like that.

291
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:21,769
I'm glad I didn't have any dirty laundry.

292
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:26,106
Was this place here when you left?

293
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:28,442
Miyagi leave Okinawa by boat.

294
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:31,570
No airport Okinawa at that time.

295
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,489
You know, I kept looking through my book.

296
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:36,784
I still can't find your village on a map.
How are we gonna find it?

297
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:38,160
Ask taxi.

298
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:42,456
Hey, Mr. Miyagi, isn't that him?

299
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:47,753
Hey, can you break a log like that?

300
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:51,799
Don't know. Never been attacked by tree.

301
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:10,943
It is great honor. I am Chozen Toguchi.

302
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:14,321
Yukie-san say sorry
she could not meet you herself.

303
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:16,615
We have a car waiting for you.

304
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:19,201
Car?

305
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:22,204
Please.

306
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:27,585
You speak very good English, Toguchi-san.

307
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:30,296
In Okinawa, it help to speak
very good English.

308
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:33,757
My friend and student, Daniel LaRusso.

309
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:35,718
Thank you.

310
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:38,929
- You karate student, huh?
- Yeah.

311
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:41,348
- Hello. Welcome to Okinawa.
- Thanks.

312
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:44,768
I hope your stay here is a pleasant one.

313
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:25,267
How you know I be here today?

314
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:28,979
Okinawa very small place.

315
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:41,241
Village south.

316
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:43,744
Why, please, we go north now?

317
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:47,081
Some things have changed
since you go, Miyagi-san.

318
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:49,416
And some things have not, eh?

319
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:13,774
Out!

320
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:28,622
- What's going on?
- No talking!

321
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:38,924
Uncle!

322
00:28:56,025 --> 00:28:57,484
Sato.

323
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:03,657
So, coward, you return.

324
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:07,661
To settle affairs with father.

325
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:10,497
And with me.

326
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:14,543
Sato, I no fight you.

327
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:18,839
Then you die as you have lived,

328
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:21,216
a coward!

329
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:28,766
You see your father,

330
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:31,018
then you see me!

331
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:01,590
- What are you gonna do?
- Find taxi.

332
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:03,467
No. About Sato.

333
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:05,636
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

334
00:30:06,095 --> 00:30:07,554
Nothing.

335
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:21,068
All this because you had to go and tell
everybody you were gonna marry Yukie?

336
00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:25,864
Why didn't you just marry her
and move to Alaska?

337
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:28,742
Daniel-san, nobody perfect.

338
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:47,594
- Where you going, buddy?
- Tomi Village.

339
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,013
Tomi Village? Never heard of it.

340
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:52,349
This is Kadena Air Base.

341
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:54,184
Sarge, Tomi Village?

342
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:57,855
You're standing on it, Corporal!
Get them out of here!

343
00:30:57,939 --> 00:30:59,773
Right. Just take that road and make a right.

344
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:05,362
Daniel-san,

345
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:10,158
Miyagi remember first time
father teach fishing,

346
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:12,119
right off this point.

347
00:31:12,912 --> 00:31:15,622
Was 1927.

348
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,459
Was much quieter then.

349
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:54,328
- Thanks a lot.
- Hai.

350
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:10,969
Take off shoe.

351
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:28,612
Auntie Yukie said you would come.

352
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:30,739
Yukie... Where is she?

353
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:36,036
- Nursing your father.
- Domo.

354
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:40,582
- Hi. I'm Daniel.
- Hi. I am Kumiko.

355
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:42,626
- Please.
- Thank you.

356
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:44,938
He sleeping.

357
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,610
Yukie,

358
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:56,825
how you know where to find me?

359
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:02,831
Have known for many years.

360
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:07,711
Why you never write sooner?

361
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:11,923
Out of respect.

362
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:17,304
- For husband.
- No.

363
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:20,140
For your silence.

364
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:24,644
I never marry.

365
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:48,627
What did he say?

366
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:54,257
"If I am dreaming, let me never awake.

367
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:59,429
"If I am awake, let me never sleep. "

368
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:51,565
Good morning.

369
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:55,402
You're Yukie.

370
00:35:56,028 --> 00:35:58,280
- You Daniel-san.
- Yes.

371
00:35:58,364 --> 00:36:00,282
Mr. Miyagi's told me a lot about you.

372
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:04,536
And he tell me lot about you.

373
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:07,831
- There's not that much to tell.
- Oh, no.

374
00:36:07,915 --> 00:36:12,335
He very proud of you.

375
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:13,753
Well...

376
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:17,507
How's his father feeling?

377
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,594
Very tired.

378
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:25,640
Miyagi Sensei in dojo.

379
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:28,185
- Thank you.
- Hai.

380
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:29,769
See you later.

381
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:56,546
- Good morning, Daniel-san.
- Good morning.

382
00:36:56,631 --> 00:37:00,467
- Welcome to Miyagi family dojo. You like?
- It's great.

383
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:04,012
This is really something.
Who are all these guys?

384
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:07,641
All the Miyagi ancestor, 400 year worth.

385
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:10,560
And who's that?

386
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:17,525
That is Miyagi Shimpo Sensei.
First Miyagi bring karate to Okinawa.

387
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:19,152
The one who went to China.

388
00:37:20,112 --> 00:37:21,571
1625.

389
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:24,991
- I forgot. How did he get there? By boat?
- By accident.

390
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:29,079
Like all Miyagi,
Shimpo Sensei was fisherman.

391
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:31,623
Love fishing. Love sake.

392
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:36,086
One day, strong wind, strong sun,

393
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:39,464
strong sake, but no fish.

394
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:43,385
Shimpo Sensei fall asleep
off coast of Okinawa,

395
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:46,721
wake up off coast of China.

396
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:50,725
Ten year later, he come back
with Chinese wife and two kids

397
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:55,981
and secret of Miyagi family karate.

398
00:37:58,484 --> 00:38:00,485
This is the secret of your family's karate?

399
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:06,533
- I don't get it.
- Practice. You will. Come. We go work.

400
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:12,372
- What are these things?
- This rules to karate.

401
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:17,752
Rule number one, karate for defense only.

402
00:38:20,923 --> 00:38:25,260
Rule number two,
first learn rule number one.

403
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:47,949
- Daniel-san.
- Yeah, coming.

404
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:58,001
God, this looks like the town
that time forgot.

405
00:38:58,085 --> 00:38:59,085
Yeah.

406
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:07,802
I think we went school together.
I would introduce you, but I forget name.

407
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:13,516
How come if this is a fishing village,
I don't see anybody fishing?

408
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:15,143
Yukie-san tell me last night.

409
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:19,647
After war, Sato father bring
in big commercial fishing boat.

410
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:24,736
Inside two year, all fish gone.
All small boat gone.

411
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:29,199
Almost everything gone, except old cannery.

412
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:34,204
And lots of memories. Ichiro.

413
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:41,169
When I left, he was same place,
doing same thing, playing same tune.

414
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:48,635
That's a shrine, right?

415
00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:50,804
Shinto shrine.

416
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:55,767
Boy, it must've been tough times
with all the fish gone, huh?

417
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:57,477
Very tough.

418
00:39:57,978 --> 00:40:01,564
Most people leave village for city,
look for work.

419
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:05,235
My father, some others,
invent whole new economy.

420
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:08,822
Go into vegetable business,
save what was left of village.

421
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:10,740
So, what?
So, everyone owns their own little farm?

422
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:13,201
No. Sato own. Village rent.

423
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:17,497
- That's a bummer.
- You're right. Familiar face.

424
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:22,460
After school,
Kumiko teach O-Bon dance to kids.

425
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:39,018
O- Bon dance. O-Bon dance.

426
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,770
It's for the festival
in honor of the dead, right?

427
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:42,355
Very good, Daniel-san.

428
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,983
Yeah, I remember reading about it last night.

429
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:48,069
What is that, a pillbox?
Probably left over from World War II.

430
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:53,575
Boy, it must've been terrible here.
15,000 Americans killed in like 10 days.

431
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:57,704
Yeah. And 150,000 Okinawan and Japanese.

432
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:00,748
Why we all so stupid?

433
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,534
You have seen father?

434
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:40,663
Then we finish tonight.

435
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:44,042
I bring a nephew for witness.

436
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:49,130
Then you and nephew both
lose sleep tonight. I not be there.

437
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:50,882
Your teacher coward!

438
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:56,846
You leave me no choice.

439
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:12,403
- Wait a second.
- Daniel-san.

440
00:42:18,452 --> 00:42:21,621
Your father, he want you.

441
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:24,999
And you, too.

442
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:32,358
Out of respect for my teacher,
I give you three days to mourn.

443
00:43:37,364 --> 00:43:40,199
When finish, I come back.

444
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:44,078
You prepare to join him.

445
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:13,978
You know, when my father died,

446
00:46:14,646 --> 00:46:18,316
I spent a lot of time
thinking I wasn't such a great son.

447
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:24,530
Like, maybe I could have listened
a little more,

448
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,910
or spent some more time with him together.

449
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:35,208
I felt so guilty, you know, like...

450
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:39,295
Like, he did everything for me
and I didn't do anything for him.

451
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:53,559
And then one day I realized, I did
the greatest thing for him before he died.

452
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:58,606
I was there with him,

453
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:01,692
and I held his hand,

454
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:04,278
and I said goodbye.

455
00:47:56,957 --> 00:47:59,917
Very good, Daniel-san. Time for next lesson.

456
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:02,628
All right!

457
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:09,218
You know, I don't get something.

458
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:13,472
If Sato hates you so much,
why does he give you time to mourn?

459
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:15,474
My father was his teacher.

460
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:18,686
Inside the heart,
Sato still know right from wrong.

461
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:22,356
- But he still wants to kill you.
- Sometime what heart know, head forget.

462
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:24,901
Yeah, but the guy's looking to go to war.
I don't understand.

463
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:27,403
Never stop war by taking part in one.

464
00:48:27,487 --> 00:48:29,238
Yeah, I know.
But what if he threw that punch over there?

465
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:31,490
- What would you have done?
- Block.

466
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:33,242
You think you could've?

467
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:36,495
- Even you could have.
- I'm not that strong.

468
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:39,707
Not matter who's stronger.
Matter who's smarter.

469
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:46,380
- I guess that's why I won the tournament.
- Good guess, Daniel-san.

470
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:56,682
From very first karate lesson,
Miyagi father always say,

471
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:59,852
"Best way to avoid punch, no be there. "

472
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:03,981
- I don't get it.
- Miyagi say same thing until I work here.

473
00:49:04,524 --> 00:49:07,276
Miyagi first job, work for Sato father.

474
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:16,035
One day, Miyagi mind on something
other than fish when empty net return.

475
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:25,169
- That was a little close.
- Drum technique. Understand?

476
00:49:26,755 --> 00:49:29,298
- Yeah!
- Drum technique.

477
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:31,050
Yeah, let me try.

478
00:49:33,428 --> 00:49:38,391
Oh, come on. Just one turn, please.
Oh, come on, you gotta. Just one turn.

479
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:45,648
- Please?
- Okay, come platform.

480
00:49:46,274 --> 00:49:49,110
- Great.
- I go pull up hook.

481
00:49:53,615 --> 00:49:57,785
Father say use drum technique
only as last resort.

482
00:49:57,869 --> 00:50:00,997
- Okay. You ready?
- Yeah, I'm ready. Let's do it.

483
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:06,752
- Remember, best block, no be there.
- Okay.

484
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:09,922
One, two, three!

485
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:19,348
- Daniel-san, you all right?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

486
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:22,309
Come. Enough for today.
Try again tomorrow.

487
00:50:31,611 --> 00:50:35,406
You know,
Miyagi and Yukie have first date here.

488
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:39,035
Remember like was yesterday.

489
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:44,415
Happen over load of fresh mackerel.

490
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:00,222
Daniel-san, you all right?

491
00:51:01,683 --> 00:51:04,477
Yeah. I'm sorry. That was pretty stupid.

492
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:12,568
Miyagi say that to father
when same thing happened.

493
00:51:12,652 --> 00:51:16,030
Father agree it was stupid. Father was right.

494
00:51:17,157 --> 00:51:19,992
Hey, is there a counterpunch
in the technique?

495
00:51:22,829 --> 00:51:24,121
Ask drum.

496
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:44,558
Come, Daniel-san, talk to drum later.

497
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:02,284
- That guy's uncle own everything?
- Almost.

498
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:06,747
Hey! There's Miyagi the coward.
And his baby!

499
00:52:08,041 --> 00:52:10,793
- Doesn't that bother you?
- Why should it?

500
00:52:10,877 --> 00:52:13,629
All the people might believe it's true
or something.

501
00:52:13,713 --> 00:52:18,134
Daniel-san, lie become truth only
if person want to believe it.

502
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:23,806
- Is that another old Okinawan saying?
- No. New Okinawa saying.

503
00:52:24,724 --> 00:52:26,016
How new?

504
00:52:27,352 --> 00:52:29,061
About 10 seconds.

505
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:35,568
Hey! Hey, are you okay?

506
00:52:36,069 --> 00:52:37,361
I'll get it.

507
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:40,948
Carrots, right?

508
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,202
- Ichiro.
- Daniel.

509
00:52:45,287 --> 00:52:46,412
- Daniel?
- Yes.

510
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:50,791
I'll get it. I'll get it.

511
00:53:03,096 --> 00:53:05,931
Your little teacher should get hearing aid.

512
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:10,060
- Maybe you need one, too.
- I only hear what's worth listening to.

513
00:53:12,105 --> 00:53:14,148
Come on, we are working here.

514
00:53:14,232 --> 00:53:15,733
What is this?

515
00:53:19,946 --> 00:53:21,822
So, you cheat people?

516
00:53:21,907 --> 00:53:25,159
- Shame! Shame!
- You cheat! You cheat!

517
00:53:25,243 --> 00:53:28,162
We'll talk sometime
when you're not so busy.

518
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:40,090
You still remember our song?

519
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:43,969
Sing for me.

520
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:51,268
- Yukie, I no sing long time.
- Please. Please.

521
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:07,826
We were so young then.

522
00:54:08,662 --> 00:54:12,289
Yukie, why you never marry?

523
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:14,875
You never come back.

524
00:54:16,544 --> 00:54:18,379
You knew I would not.

525
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:22,216
Yes, I knew.

526
00:54:25,345 --> 00:54:26,762
My father,

527
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:33,227
he ever tell you about
how he feel when I leave?

528
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:38,482
One time.

529
00:54:40,235 --> 00:54:45,864
He say he love you very much

530
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:52,788
and what you did was right.

531
00:54:59,212 --> 00:55:01,046
Except for one thing.

532
00:55:05,343 --> 00:55:07,720
I should have taken you with me.

533
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:42,046
- Hello.
- Hi.

534
00:55:42,922 --> 00:55:45,841
- I am disturbing you?
- What? No, no, not at all.

535
00:55:46,718 --> 00:55:48,052
What are you doing?

536
00:55:48,136 --> 00:55:51,513
- I was just practicing some moves. See?
- What are moves?

537
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:54,767
Well, it's like karate.
I'm trying to figure this thing out here.

538
00:55:55,935 --> 00:55:57,895
Looks like O-Bon dance.

539
00:55:58,772 --> 00:56:00,689
Well, then I must be doing
something wrong.

540
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:03,275
No, no, no. Doing something right. Look.

541
00:56:25,256 --> 00:56:28,550
- Wow. Where'd you learn that?
- From my auntie.

542
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:31,637
- That's terrific.
- You try.

543
00:56:33,098 --> 00:56:36,183
No, not me.
I was absent the day they taught graceful.

544
00:56:36,935 --> 00:56:40,145
- You were what?
- Forget it. It's just a bad joke.

545
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:42,689
- I'll try it. I'll try.
- Good.

546
00:56:50,949 --> 00:56:52,574
Wait a sec. Okay.

547
00:56:55,870 --> 00:56:59,039
Right and left.

548
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:21,228
Hey, look at this. We're a hit.
Maybe we could take it on the road.

549
00:57:22,522 --> 00:57:24,440
But we are on the road.

550
00:57:25,775 --> 00:57:29,778
You dance very nice. Like geisha.

551
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:31,989
Come on, Daniel-san, let's go.

552
00:57:32,073 --> 00:57:36,034
His little teacher's favorite technique, huh?
"Let's go. "

553
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:40,080
Hey, come on.
Give me the drum back, please.

554
00:57:40,165 --> 00:57:41,707
- You mean the baby rattle?
- Come on.

555
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:44,460
- Why don't baby come take it back?
- Oh, man...

556
00:57:46,212 --> 00:57:47,588
Hey, man!

557
00:57:49,507 --> 00:57:51,550
Daniel-san, are you okay?

558
00:57:52,802 --> 00:57:55,095
You insult my honor again,

559
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:57,890
and I kill you.

560
00:58:16,993 --> 00:58:20,704
You keep for your collection.
I know you like it.

561
00:58:29,255 --> 00:58:32,341
- Are you all right, Daniel-san?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

562
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:45,062
He cheats these people
and I'm insulting his honor. I don't get it.

563
00:58:45,605 --> 00:58:49,483
- He has no idea what honor is.
- Yeah, I kind of got that feeling.

564
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:53,779
Ever since we were children,
he has always been the same.

565
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:58,200
This is the first time I ever had somebody
ever tell me they're gonna kill me.

566
00:58:58,284 --> 00:59:00,786
This is ridiculous.
I gotta go talk to him or something.

567
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:05,249
He would only take it as a sign of weakness
and only try to hurt you again.

568
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:07,000
You got any ideas?

569
00:59:08,294 --> 00:59:09,628
Avoid him.

570
00:59:11,464 --> 00:59:13,799
I think I'm on the wrong island.

571
00:59:18,137 --> 00:59:21,139
- What's going on here?
- Tea ceremony.

572
00:59:22,767 --> 00:59:25,477
I guess it's an old ritual or something.

573
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:32,276
It means that they are falling in love again.

574
01:00:16,696 --> 01:00:19,615
- Daniel-san.
- I've been looking all over for you.

575
01:00:19,699 --> 01:00:23,493
- Been here trying to fix refrigerator.
- What's wrong with it?

576
01:00:24,537 --> 01:00:27,873
This. Gotta go Naha City for new part.

577
01:00:28,916 --> 01:00:30,375
You like come?

578
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:32,544
I was supposed to go sightseeing
with Kumiko,

579
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:34,087
- but I can go.
- Okay.

580
01:00:34,172 --> 01:00:36,506
- You go, have a good time.
- No, no, we could go tomorrow.

581
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:37,674
- No, I see you later.
- It's no big deal.

582
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:39,635
But we don't have plans.
There's nothing set.

583
01:00:39,719 --> 01:00:42,721
Daniel-san, never keep lady waiting.

584
01:00:44,557 --> 01:00:49,019
I'll remember that. I'll see you later.
Hi, sorry to keep you waiting.

585
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:10,582
Be careful.

586
01:01:13,211 --> 01:01:16,880
- This reminds me of the Palisades.
- Palisades? Where's that?

587
01:01:17,924 --> 01:01:21,593
- It's in New Jersey, where I used to live.
- Is it pretty?

588
01:01:22,970 --> 01:01:24,388
Some of it.

589
01:01:26,432 --> 01:01:30,435
There it is!
The ruins of the castle of King Sho Hashi.

590
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:32,145
The Peace King.

591
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:35,107
- You know King Sho Hashi?
- Not personally.

592
01:01:35,983 --> 01:01:37,109
Name of it is...

593
01:01:38,611 --> 01:01:40,237
Now Sato owns it.

594
01:01:40,321 --> 01:01:43,949
In old days, O-Bon dance was held here,
but no more.

595
01:01:44,325 --> 01:01:46,368
Now every piece goes away.

596
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:50,455
Sato, he sells it to museums.

597
01:01:51,249 --> 01:01:52,874
Sounds like him.

598
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:58,422
Legend is, if you race up to the castle
and win, your wish will come true.

599
01:01:58,506 --> 01:01:59,840
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

600
01:01:59,924 --> 01:02:02,801
- I'll give you a head start.
- Not necessary, thank you.

601
01:02:03,469 --> 01:02:07,013
- Excuse me.
- Ready, set, go!

602
01:02:07,098 --> 01:02:08,140
Hey!

603
01:02:25,158 --> 01:02:28,326
- I won!
- You cheated! And you know you did.

604
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:33,665
- We'll share the wish.
- Okay.

605
01:02:34,041 --> 01:02:35,667
Close your eyes.

606
01:02:51,976 --> 01:02:53,268
Hey, you know what I really wanna know?

607
01:02:53,352 --> 01:02:54,936
Like, what do you wanna do with your life?

608
01:02:55,021 --> 01:02:56,521
What do you wanna do?
What are your dreams?

609
01:02:56,606 --> 01:02:58,690
Okay, I'll show you my dream.

610
01:02:58,775 --> 01:03:02,277
You know, I still can't get used to people
driving on the wrong side of the street.

611
01:03:02,361 --> 01:03:05,363
- What side of the street do you drive on?
- On the right side, you know.

612
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:06,448
I didn't know that.

613
01:03:06,532 --> 01:03:09,117
Yeah, everybody drives
on the right side of the street.

614
01:03:09,202 --> 01:03:12,287
- Not everybody.
- Well, that's what I'm learning.

615
01:03:18,669 --> 01:03:21,797
- So, what? You want to sell TVs for a living?
- No.

616
01:03:21,881 --> 01:03:24,800
What? Interested in electronics?
I don't understand.

617
01:03:24,884 --> 01:03:27,135
No. There.

618
01:03:29,055 --> 01:03:30,680
That is my dream.

619
01:03:31,849 --> 01:03:34,559
- You want to be a dancer.
- Very much.

620
01:03:35,269 --> 01:03:38,897
Well, that's a great thing to be.
So, where do you study?

621
01:03:40,691 --> 01:03:43,652
No schools for this kind of dancing
in Okinawa.

622
01:03:43,736 --> 01:03:45,153
What a drag.

623
01:03:46,447 --> 01:03:50,075
Come to the dance tonight.
Oh, bring your friend.

624
01:03:50,159 --> 01:03:52,244
- Okay.
- Good. See you there.

625
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:56,998
- Like to go to dance?
- Sure. That's Sato's dojo.

626
01:03:59,335 --> 01:04:04,714
- Hey, I want to check that out. Come on.
- Not inside. Chozen teaches in there.

627
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:07,676
Hey, I'm not gonna go inside.
I just wanna see, you know.

628
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:10,470
Look through the window. He won't see me.

629
01:04:10,555 --> 01:04:13,890
- He teach American military police in there.
- Really?

630
01:04:15,601 --> 01:04:18,103
You must learn to move very quickly.

631
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:31,700
- He's not bad.
- He's Sato's number-one student.

632
01:04:31,784 --> 01:04:35,537
- I can see why.
- We must go. He may see you.

633
01:04:44,797 --> 01:04:48,216
Hey, you know,
maybe we'll run into Mr. Miyagi out here.

634
01:04:48,301 --> 01:04:49,259
Why would he be here?

635
01:04:49,343 --> 01:04:53,138
He said he had to come into town to get
a part for his refrigerator or something.

636
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:56,516
I know that store. It's right around corner.

637
01:04:56,601 --> 01:04:58,935
Maybe we will see him.

638
01:05:02,523 --> 01:05:07,402
- What's going on in here?
- This bad place. We don't want to go in here.

639
01:05:07,486 --> 01:05:10,113
- Hey, come on, let's check it out.
- No.

640
01:05:30,551 --> 01:05:33,219
Come on, baby, you can do it.
Give me the money.

641
01:05:33,304 --> 01:05:37,849
All right. I've got 40 right here.
Come on, baby. Come on. Come on.

642
01:05:39,143 --> 01:05:42,270
Show me you can do it.
Show me you can do it.

643
01:05:42,355 --> 01:05:46,441
- Yeah! I got 40!
- This guy's standing wrong.

644
01:05:47,652 --> 01:05:50,528
- See? I told you. You gotta use your hip.
- But he looks so strong.

645
01:05:50,613 --> 01:05:53,949
No, you gotta be strong here, not here.
It doesn't make a difference.

646
01:05:54,033 --> 01:05:57,619
Why, you think you can do better,
big mouth, huh?

647
01:05:57,703 --> 01:05:59,955
You think you can do better? Drop some ice.

648
01:06:00,039 --> 01:06:02,832
- I don't know.
- Then let us find out, huh?

649
01:06:02,917 --> 01:06:06,169
- Maybe some other time.
- There is no other time!

650
01:06:06,253 --> 01:06:09,589
Listen, whatever problems Mr. Miyagi has
with your uncle, they don't have to be ours.

651
01:06:09,674 --> 01:06:13,385
- Let me out of here.
- No. We have our own, huh?

652
01:06:14,679 --> 01:06:17,472
- Hey, Kumiko, where are you going?
- You go nowhere!

653
01:06:18,307 --> 01:06:20,976
Call my uncle. You will take a bet.

654
01:06:23,771 --> 01:06:25,105
I give three to one.

655
01:06:25,189 --> 01:06:28,942
What? No, no, no, I'm not doing it!
I'm not doing it!

656
01:06:29,026 --> 01:06:33,321
You have a choice,
broken ice or broken neck.

657
01:06:33,406 --> 01:06:38,910
- Hey, he's got to break all three, right?
- Wrong! All six!

658
01:06:40,454 --> 01:06:45,834
- All the bets in. All the bets in.
- Not all bets. Not yet.

659
01:06:48,087 --> 01:06:52,632
- Boy, am I glad to see you here.
- No worry nothing. Miyagi fix everything.

660
01:06:52,717 --> 01:06:57,012
- What odds?
- Three to one he does not make through ice.

661
01:06:57,096 --> 01:06:59,639
- How many pieces?
- Six.

662
01:07:00,433 --> 01:07:02,100
Okay. Come on, let's get out of here.

663
01:07:02,601 --> 01:07:07,105
- $600 say he break all six.
- 600 bucks?

664
01:07:08,190 --> 01:07:11,192
- I cannot cover that.
- You are covered.

665
01:07:15,823 --> 01:07:17,449
Now we have bet.

666
01:07:18,784 --> 01:07:20,869
All right! All right, give me your money.

667
01:07:20,953 --> 01:07:23,246
Hey, come here. I can't believe this.

668
01:07:23,330 --> 01:07:26,541
What, are you crazy? What, are you crazy?
I'm not gonna be able to break that.

669
01:07:26,625 --> 01:07:29,294
That guy just tried, he's twice my size,
he only got through two of them.

670
01:07:29,378 --> 01:07:31,713
- What do you expect me to do?
- Focus.

671
01:07:31,797 --> 01:07:34,549
- Great, and what are you gonna do?
- Pray.

672
01:07:37,803 --> 01:07:39,763
You got it. All bets are in.

673
01:08:35,694 --> 01:08:40,740
- We do not honor bet with coward.
- Do not embarrass uncle again.

674
01:08:50,042 --> 01:08:54,087
Thank you, Sato.
Pleasure do business with you.

675
01:08:59,635 --> 01:09:02,929
Hey, you knew it all along, didn't you?
You didn't have a doubt in your mind, man.

676
01:09:03,013 --> 01:09:04,347
- No doubt.
- So, what're we gonna do?

677
01:09:04,431 --> 01:09:06,641
How're we gonna spend it?
What're we gonna get?

678
01:09:06,725 --> 01:09:10,645
You get college tuition.
We get Chinese food. Come.

679
01:09:26,579 --> 01:09:29,122
Daniel-san, I thought you have date.

680
01:09:29,957 --> 01:09:32,125
Yeah, I was just waiting for Kumiko.

681
01:09:32,209 --> 01:09:36,087
Boy, I wish you had one of these back home.
This place is terrific.

682
01:09:36,839 --> 01:09:38,882
No use weapon for duster.

683
01:09:40,009 --> 01:09:42,468
- What, this old rag?
- Drop old rag.

684
01:09:43,220 --> 01:09:44,762
- Why?
- Drop.

685
01:09:47,933 --> 01:09:49,976
- What I see?
- I don't...

686
01:09:52,021 --> 01:09:53,730
- Right.
- Primary target.

687
01:09:53,814 --> 01:09:56,107
- Primary target. A little close.
- Konichiwa.

688
01:09:56,442 --> 01:09:57,859
- Hi.
- Hi.

689
01:09:57,943 --> 01:10:00,278
This is for you. Dance clothes.

690
01:10:01,614 --> 01:10:06,951
Miyagi!

691
01:10:09,955 --> 01:10:12,081
Come on! We waiting for you.

692
01:10:13,167 --> 01:10:16,878
My uncle say your three days mourning over.

693
01:10:18,631 --> 01:10:24,928
- I have been sent to get you.
- Tell uncle I am farmer, not fighter.

694
01:10:55,125 --> 01:10:57,752
Sensei, a visitor to see you.

695
01:11:11,392 --> 01:11:14,936
Is that same wood we find together
on beach that time?

696
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:17,063
Same. What you want?

697
01:11:18,941 --> 01:11:23,486
- Come make peace between us.
- You forget. You betray me.

698
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:28,908
- I was only 18 years old.
- And responsible for own action.

699
01:11:30,035 --> 01:11:33,705
- It explain why I leave.
- Fear is why you leave.

700
01:11:34,873 --> 01:11:39,794
- Sato, I beg you.
- Your fear make air stink.

701
01:11:44,883 --> 01:11:46,926
What has happened to you?

702
01:12:22,046 --> 01:12:23,421
Isn't this great?

703
01:12:24,214 --> 01:12:25,548
Yeah, it's nice.

704
01:12:26,216 --> 01:12:29,218
Are you still worried about
what happened this afternoon?

705
01:12:29,303 --> 01:12:31,596
Well, you see,
I came here to help Mr. Miyagi.

706
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:33,931
And all this stuff, I feel so helpless.

707
01:12:34,558 --> 01:12:36,142
Nothing you can do.

708
01:12:36,226 --> 01:12:37,643
Yeah. I guess.

709
01:12:37,728 --> 01:12:39,437
Can you dance like this?

710
01:12:39,521 --> 01:12:41,272
I can try.

711
01:12:41,357 --> 01:12:43,941
- One, two, three, four. Got it?
- I think so.

712
01:13:35,661 --> 01:13:37,412
Hey, you're very good.

713
01:13:37,496 --> 01:13:38,663
- You tease me.
- No, really.

714
01:13:38,747 --> 01:13:41,124
- You're a great dancer.
- You're a very good partner.

715
01:13:42,626 --> 01:13:44,544
Want to get something to drink?
Sit down or something?

716
01:13:44,628 --> 01:13:45,878
Okay.

717
01:13:45,963 --> 01:13:47,880
Where did you learn how to dance like that?

718
01:13:47,965 --> 01:13:51,050
Well, I've been
my mom's practice partner for years.

719
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:53,094
She must be a good teacher.

720
01:13:53,178 --> 01:13:55,388
Yeah, she's great. Have a seat.

721
01:13:55,472 --> 01:13:57,682
- Okay, thanks.
- Man.

722
01:14:00,686 --> 01:14:04,313
- You feeling better now?
- God. Much better, thanks.

723
01:14:05,441 --> 01:14:07,191
That's good.

724
01:14:09,111 --> 01:14:13,364
Hey, can I ask you something?

725
01:14:14,658 --> 01:14:15,992
Sure.

726
01:14:16,076 --> 01:14:17,160
It's, you know...

727
01:14:17,244 --> 01:14:20,371
It's kind of personal, though.

728
01:14:25,961 --> 01:14:27,336
Are you...

729
01:14:28,213 --> 01:14:30,923
Are you arranged like, you know?

730
01:14:31,550 --> 01:14:33,176
Arranged?

731
01:14:33,635 --> 01:14:35,428
Well, to marry somebody?

732
01:14:38,223 --> 01:14:41,184
No. That's an old custom.

733
01:14:42,227 --> 01:14:44,312
Whoever I marry is up to me.

734
01:14:45,063 --> 01:14:46,814
Well, that's good.

735
01:14:47,733 --> 01:14:49,108
Are you arranged?

736
01:14:50,235 --> 01:14:52,403
What, are you kidding? I'm a free agent.

737
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:55,114
What is free agent?

738
01:14:55,199 --> 01:14:57,742
Well, that just means that I'm available.

739
01:15:00,370 --> 01:15:01,787
That's good.

740
01:15:02,748 --> 01:15:04,207
Yeah.

741
01:15:12,674 --> 01:15:15,843
Oh, no, not again.
Hey, I'm not looking for any trouble.

742
01:15:15,928 --> 01:15:17,887
Maybe trouble looking for you.

743
01:15:18,472 --> 01:15:19,805
What do you want from me?

744
01:15:20,599 --> 01:15:22,058
My money back.

745
01:15:30,108 --> 01:15:32,193
Come on, man, that's all my money.

746
01:15:32,277 --> 01:15:34,654
No. All my money.

747
01:15:39,576 --> 01:15:44,330
Don't have worry about the little friend.
We take her home.

748
01:15:58,387 --> 01:15:59,804
Thank you.

749
01:16:01,473 --> 01:16:02,890
- Come on!
- Hai.

750
01:16:02,975 --> 01:16:05,643
Hey, coming through! Coming through!
Look out.

751
01:16:09,231 --> 01:16:10,648
Sorry.

752
01:16:12,150 --> 01:16:13,776
You got the keys?

753
01:16:16,822 --> 01:16:18,030
Come on.

754
01:16:57,195 --> 01:16:58,487
Miyagi!

755
01:16:59,698 --> 01:17:01,991
Miyagi, come out.

756
01:17:04,036 --> 01:17:05,369
Miyagi!

757
01:17:07,039 --> 01:17:09,123
We fight now!

758
01:17:44,993 --> 01:17:47,578
What are you guys doing here? Hey!

759
01:17:48,372 --> 01:17:49,789
Where Miyagi?

760
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:51,707
I don't know.

761
01:17:55,754 --> 01:17:57,922
Leave him message for me.

762
01:17:58,757 --> 01:18:00,257
With pleasure.

763
01:18:05,514 --> 01:18:08,182
Come here. I want to show you something.

764
01:18:46,930 --> 01:18:50,349
Your sensei teach you
how to fight with spear, huh?

765
01:18:51,935 --> 01:18:52,977
No.

766
01:18:57,023 --> 01:18:58,315
Too bad.

767
01:18:59,526 --> 01:19:02,236
Maybe he teach you how to be coward.

768
01:19:03,321 --> 01:19:04,947
Hey, Mr. Coward.

769
01:19:18,044 --> 01:19:19,837
Leave message.

770
01:19:34,686 --> 01:19:36,729
This your teacher's fault.

771
01:19:37,063 --> 01:19:40,149
If he were man with honor, you would live.

772
01:19:41,193 --> 01:19:43,319
But he's not.

773
01:19:58,001 --> 01:19:59,251
Enough!

774
01:20:01,254 --> 01:20:04,256
Uncle problem with Miyagi, not with boy.

775
01:20:04,716 --> 01:20:08,803
No, you have problem, old man, with me.

776
01:21:02,107 --> 01:21:03,774
Act of coward!

777
01:21:08,446 --> 01:21:10,322
Daniel-san, you okay?

778
01:21:10,407 --> 01:21:12,867
He was really gonna kill me.

779
01:21:15,453 --> 01:21:16,871
Come.

780
01:21:20,792 --> 01:21:23,419
Miyagi make tea. Make you feel better.

781
01:21:24,254 --> 01:21:26,797
Tomorrow we go home.

782
01:22:09,591 --> 01:22:14,428
I did not want for us to end this way again.

783
01:22:16,473 --> 01:22:18,724
I would stay if I could.

784
01:22:20,477 --> 01:22:21,769
I know.

785
01:22:44,292 --> 01:22:48,879
Yukie, what can I do to ease your pain?

786
01:22:57,347 --> 01:22:59,098
Take me with you.

787
01:23:19,828 --> 01:23:22,579
- Hi.
- Hi.

788
01:23:24,040 --> 01:23:25,749
What you doing?

789
01:23:27,711 --> 01:23:29,253
Old custom.

790
01:23:30,797 --> 01:23:33,132
When fishermen would go out to sea,

791
01:23:33,591 --> 01:23:36,635
families would offer rice to the gods.

792
01:23:38,763 --> 01:23:40,597
For a good catch?

793
01:23:42,851 --> 01:23:44,601
For a quick return.

794
01:23:52,360 --> 01:23:54,737
Thought any more about dance school?

795
01:23:56,114 --> 01:23:59,616
I told you. No schools for that here.

796
01:24:00,285 --> 01:24:02,703
Well, there are in the States.

797
01:24:03,788 --> 01:24:05,497
My home is here.

798
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:11,128
Home is where you hang your hat.

799
01:24:14,591 --> 01:24:16,675
You think I would like America?

800
01:24:17,343 --> 01:24:19,386
I think you would love it.

801
01:24:22,599 --> 01:24:24,808
Do you think it would love me?

802
01:24:27,896 --> 01:24:30,773
Well, I know one part of it that already does.

803
01:24:38,615 --> 01:24:40,741
- What's going on?
- Let's go see.

804
01:24:40,825 --> 01:24:42,743
Okay, come on.

805
01:25:11,356 --> 01:25:13,232
What are you doing?

806
01:25:14,150 --> 01:25:15,442
I sell land.

807
01:25:16,194 --> 01:25:17,528
Why?

808
01:25:17,612 --> 01:25:19,113
Why you think?

809
01:25:19,781 --> 01:25:22,116
You will destroy village?

810
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:24,368
No, you will!

811
01:25:36,005 --> 01:25:37,548
You win.

812
01:25:39,092 --> 01:25:40,759
I fight you.

813
01:25:43,513 --> 01:25:45,139
One condition.

814
01:25:45,807 --> 01:25:47,516
No matter who win,

815
01:25:48,852 --> 01:25:52,062
title to land pass to village forever.

816
01:25:52,605 --> 01:25:54,439
You ask for too much.

817
01:25:55,650 --> 01:25:58,402
Small price to pay for your honor.

818
01:26:00,989 --> 01:26:03,740
You're right. Small price.

819
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:08,495
I see you here midnight.

820
01:26:17,088 --> 01:26:21,008
Miyagi, I wait long time for this.

821
01:26:22,719 --> 01:26:24,219
No tricks tonight,

822
01:26:25,471 --> 01:26:28,223
or tomorrow everything gone!

823
01:26:30,143 --> 01:26:32,769
Their homes, their church,

824
01:26:33,521 --> 01:26:36,064
everything gone!

825
01:26:52,790 --> 01:26:53,916
What's this?

826
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,709
Last will and testament.

827
01:26:56,461 --> 01:27:00,714
Yukie get house here.
You get house and pickup back home.

828
01:27:02,383 --> 01:27:05,010
No, I don't want the house
and a pickup back home. I want you.

829
01:27:05,094 --> 01:27:07,346
Can't we call this off?
Why don't we just leave?

830
01:27:11,267 --> 01:27:13,644
Impossible, Daniel-san.

831
01:27:14,312 --> 01:27:16,563
Just forget about the honor garbage.

832
01:27:17,857 --> 01:27:20,359
Have nothing to do with honor garbage.

833
01:27:21,277 --> 01:27:24,029
This have to do with village survival.

834
01:27:24,906 --> 01:27:27,824
This isn't three points and you're out.
If you lose, I know what happens.

835
01:27:29,827 --> 01:27:31,787
Miyagi already win.

836
01:27:32,330 --> 01:27:35,874
No matter what happen, village safe forever.

837
01:29:07,342 --> 01:29:09,384
So, is this seat taken?

838
01:29:15,975 --> 01:29:17,434
I'm sorry.

839
01:32:18,908 --> 01:32:20,450
- Oh, no!
- What's wrong?

840
01:32:20,535 --> 01:32:24,913
- Quickly. There's danger. We must go.
- What? I don't understand.

841
01:32:24,997 --> 01:32:28,124
Big storm. Be here soon. Not safe here.

842
01:32:28,209 --> 01:32:30,794
- So, where're we going now?
- To village.

843
01:33:17,049 --> 01:33:19,801
- Hey, Mr. Miyagi, wait up!
- Come on.

844
01:33:19,885 --> 01:33:21,970
Do you believe all this wind? This is wild.

845
01:33:22,054 --> 01:33:24,180
And it get wilder.

846
01:33:38,863 --> 01:33:40,655
Are those people out there?

847
01:33:43,034 --> 01:33:45,535
Come. We go help.

848
01:33:55,421 --> 01:33:57,339
Stay there! We coming! Stay there!

849
01:33:57,423 --> 01:33:59,549
They need our help, boy. Careful...

850
01:33:59,634 --> 01:34:02,010
Hey, are you all right? You okay?

851
01:34:02,094 --> 01:34:04,220
I got baby.

852
01:34:04,305 --> 01:34:05,722
I got the boy.

853
01:34:06,182 --> 01:34:09,017
Come on. Hang on. Hold on.

854
01:34:09,727 --> 01:34:11,853
- Come, come on, come on!
- Hey.

855
01:34:13,064 --> 01:34:15,857
- Oh, no!
- Hey, Sato's in there!

856
01:34:17,193 --> 01:34:18,860
Here. Take baby.

857
01:34:18,944 --> 01:34:21,988
- I go find Sato. Go!
- What? Okay.

858
01:34:22,073 --> 01:34:25,241
- Kumiko, take him.
- Be careful. Let's go.

859
01:34:39,715 --> 01:34:41,800
Where uncle?

860
01:34:41,884 --> 01:34:43,426
He's dead.

861
01:34:51,727 --> 01:34:53,853
Come! Must work fast!

862
01:35:00,194 --> 01:35:03,446
Miyagi! Now you come to fight?

863
01:35:03,948 --> 01:35:05,365
Coward!

864
01:35:06,534 --> 01:35:08,618
Now when I am helpless!

865
01:35:09,286 --> 01:35:10,578
It won't move!

866
01:35:10,663 --> 01:35:12,956
You are lower than the storm!

867
01:35:13,708 --> 01:35:16,000
Now whole village see.

868
01:35:16,085 --> 01:35:19,671
This is only way you can win.

869
01:35:31,684 --> 01:35:35,186
Come, Daniel-san. Easy, Sato. Easy.

870
01:35:36,063 --> 01:35:37,981
I got you, old friend.

871
01:35:41,110 --> 01:35:43,027
You'll be okay now.

872
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:03,965
You take Mr. Sato back! I'll get the girl!

873
01:36:07,887 --> 01:36:09,596
Just hang on!

874
01:36:11,515 --> 01:36:13,308
Don't let go.

875
01:36:15,269 --> 01:36:18,188
Uncle! Uncle! I thought you were dead!

876
01:36:18,939 --> 01:36:20,857
I thought you were dead.

877
01:36:20,941 --> 01:36:22,358
Go help!

878
01:36:25,404 --> 01:36:27,071
Help him!

879
01:36:32,870 --> 01:36:36,331
I cannot help him. I cannot.

880
01:36:51,388 --> 01:36:52,555
Oh, no!

881
01:36:54,725 --> 01:36:57,644
Hang on! Just hang on! Hang on! Hold tight!

882
01:37:00,940 --> 01:37:02,315
No!

883
01:37:14,411 --> 01:37:15,578
Hold on!

884
01:37:22,253 --> 01:37:25,088
Just hang on! Give me your arm!

885
01:37:27,758 --> 01:37:29,384
Hold on tight!

886
01:37:36,350 --> 01:37:38,893
You're gonna be okay. We're okay. Hang on.

887
01:37:54,785 --> 01:37:57,203
Miyagi, let me go.

888
01:38:00,457 --> 01:38:02,125
You'll be okay.

889
01:38:05,754 --> 01:38:07,171
Thanks a lot.

890
01:38:24,315 --> 01:38:28,318
Now, to you I am dead.

891
01:38:59,767 --> 01:39:01,726
How're they gonna recover from this?

892
01:39:01,810 --> 01:39:04,270
All the seeds are gone. The place is wrecked.

893
01:39:04,355 --> 01:39:07,023
- What are they gonna do now?
- Best they can.

894
01:39:09,693 --> 01:39:12,528
What is all this? What's Sato doing here?

895
01:39:12,613 --> 01:39:14,280
Don't know.

896
01:39:28,003 --> 01:39:29,712
I come help rebuild.

897
01:39:30,422 --> 01:39:32,423
Here deed to village.

898
01:39:34,218 --> 01:39:37,178
Forgive me. I beg you.

899
01:39:39,640 --> 01:39:43,142
Sato, nothing to forgive.

900
01:39:44,561 --> 01:39:46,604
Hey, now's a good time to ask him.

901
01:39:46,689 --> 01:39:48,815
It is not my place.

902
01:39:51,610 --> 01:39:54,487
Mr. Sato, you know, O-Bon dance is soon,

903
01:39:54,571 --> 01:39:58,324
and it's gonna be real hard, the way
things are, to have it here in the village.

904
01:39:58,951 --> 01:40:00,952
What you ask of me?

905
01:40:01,620 --> 01:40:02,954
Well, can they have it in the castle?

906
01:40:03,038 --> 01:40:05,665
That's where it really belongs
anyway, isn't it?

907
01:40:10,379 --> 01:40:12,380
Your student become my teacher.

908
01:40:14,717 --> 01:40:16,884
O- Bon will be held in castle.

909
01:40:17,761 --> 01:40:19,470
Now and forever!

910
01:40:21,557 --> 01:40:23,099
One condition.

911
01:40:24,935 --> 01:40:26,769
You dance with us.

912
01:40:27,646 --> 01:40:29,355
Well, you got it.

913
01:40:33,027 --> 01:40:34,444
- Okay?
- Okay.

914
01:40:35,529 --> 01:40:36,821
Okay.

915
01:40:38,198 --> 01:40:41,284
See, you put your mind to it,
anything can happen.

916
01:40:41,368 --> 01:40:42,994
You're right.

917
01:42:06,286 --> 01:42:08,871
You know, if it wasn't for you,
I'd be making a lot of mistakes.

918
01:42:08,956 --> 01:42:11,499
If not for you, I not be here.

919
01:42:17,631 --> 01:42:20,049
Now remember,
you have nothing to worry about.

920
01:42:20,384 --> 01:42:23,136
I'm not worried. I think I'm scared.

921
01:42:23,220 --> 01:42:24,720
Are you kidding? I've seen you do it.

922
01:42:24,805 --> 01:42:27,390
You're gonna be terrific. It's true.

923
01:42:28,392 --> 01:42:31,477
- Listen, did I tell you you look beautiful?
- No.

924
01:42:32,396 --> 01:42:34,522
Well, you do.

925
01:42:46,577 --> 01:42:49,370
I've seen her practice. She's really amazing.

926
01:43:47,804 --> 01:43:49,263
Behind you!

927
01:43:53,810 --> 01:43:54,977
Kumiko!

928
01:43:55,312 --> 01:43:56,687
Get back!

929
01:43:56,772 --> 01:43:58,814
- Get back or I'll kill her!
- Chozen!

930
01:43:59,733 --> 01:44:01,359
Don't do this.

931
01:44:01,443 --> 01:44:02,902
I was wrong.

932
01:44:03,695 --> 01:44:05,279
Hate is wrong.

933
01:44:05,364 --> 01:44:08,491
- It's over.
- I cannot hear you, Uncle.

934
01:44:08,575 --> 01:44:10,826
I am dead to you, remember, huh?

935
01:44:10,911 --> 01:44:13,996
Chozen, you are your uncle's finest student.

936
01:44:14,706 --> 01:44:16,582
No disgrace him here.

937
01:44:16,667 --> 01:44:18,834
Your student disgrace me.

938
01:44:18,919 --> 01:44:21,170
I have been dishonored all because of him.

939
01:44:21,255 --> 01:44:23,422
For whatever happened, I apologize.

940
01:44:23,507 --> 01:44:25,883
Apology will not give me back my honor!

941
01:44:25,968 --> 01:44:28,803
- Well, neither will this.
- In their eyes it will.

942
01:44:28,887 --> 01:44:32,223
No more talk. You cross bridge, or I kill her!

943
01:44:36,395 --> 01:44:37,937
Daniel-san,

944
01:44:38,313 --> 01:44:41,065
this not tournament. This for real.

945
01:44:41,566 --> 01:44:42,775
Now!

946
01:44:58,667 --> 01:45:00,042
No bridge.

947
01:45:28,613 --> 01:45:30,698
Now I dropped the bridge. Let her go.

948
01:45:32,242 --> 01:45:35,536
- Come on!
- Now we fight to death!

949
01:46:46,316 --> 01:46:48,984
Step back, Daniel-san! Step back!

950
01:48:29,711 --> 01:48:31,295
Live or die, man?

951
01:48:33,757 --> 01:48:35,174
Die.

952
01:48:36,676 --> 01:48:37,801
Wrong.
