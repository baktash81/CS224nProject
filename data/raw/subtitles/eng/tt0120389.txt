1
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,440
I've got you now, wizard.

2
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,440
Get him!

3
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,640
Search every bush and tree!
Lerigot must be caught!

4
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,240
He's over there! Hurry!

5
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,040
Come on!

6
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,840
Easy now. He's close by.
Keep your eyes open.

7
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,440
There!

8
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,840
There's no escape, Lerigot!

9
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,440
It's all over, wizard!

10
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,840
Surrender to Divatox!

11
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,840
Fools! You let him escape!

12
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,920
COACH: Come on, Rocky!
Focus, Rocky! Focus!

13
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,120
Tommy! Follow-through!
Your follow-through!

14
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:53,120
Rocky, get back in there. Let's go!

15
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,120
All right. Get in there! Get in there!

16
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,920
Watch out. Come on, move!

17
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,520
Adam, get in there!

18
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,920
All right! Get in there!

19
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,120
Rocky, spinning-heel kick! My hand!

20
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,320
No. Look, you're trying too hard.

21
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,320
CHILDREN: # Row, row, row your boat
gently down the stream #

22
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,920
# Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily,
life is but a dream #

23
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,320
# Row, row, row your boat
gently down the stream... #

24
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:35,120
- Come on, Justin. You know the words.
- I don't feel like singing.

25
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,120
- Do you want to talk about it?
- There's nothing to talk about.

26
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,520
I just don't feel like singing.

27
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,670
OK.

28
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,520
( children continue singing )

29
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,720
Hey, Rocky. Maybe we are trying too hard.

30
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,720
Maybe we're not trying hard enough.

31
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,320
- Don't move.
- My back!

32
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,720
- Can we get some help?!
- It's gonna be all right.

33
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,320
- Just relax.
- Man, I'm so stupid!

34
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,320
- You're OK, man. Just calm down.
- Don't worry. Help is on its way.

35
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,320
Yeah, that was cool.

36
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,520
Rocky!

37
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,120
Justin, wait!

38
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,720
- Everyone, wait here. It'll be OK.
- KAT: Rocky!

39
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,720
Wait here.

40
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,120
- You'll be OK.
- Hang in there, pal.

41
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,640
Idiots!

42
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,040
You're worthless! And you!

43
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,040
- Me?!
- You lost Lerigot.

44
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,040
You let him get away.

45
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:35,640
I told you those bolt-brains didn't have a clue.

46
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:38,040
- Oh, shut up, Elgar!
- Whoa!

47
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:42,840
Those are your bolt-brains,
which makes this all your fault.

48
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:46,440
Come on, don't punish me.
I'm your favourite nephew.

49
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,240
Phew.

50
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,840
Hey, you two losers,
I nearly got fired for your screw-up!

51
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,840
You're just lucky
Aunt Divatox likes me. Whoa!

52
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,040
- Not again!
- Never send a moron to do a mutant's job.

53
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,640
If you're so great,
why don't you do the job, Rygog?

54
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:09,840
That runt Lerigot is still out there
with the key to the island of Muiranthias!

55
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,840
No, thanks. But I'd be happy to lend a hand.

56
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,640
Oh, yeah. Real funny.

57
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,040
- Quiet! Both of you!
- Sorry.

58
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,040
You're giving me such a migraine.

59
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,440
I have a plan.

60
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:27,840
Once we take away the one thing
he values most in the world,

61
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:32,640
Lerigot will come to us willingly.

62
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,040
Where's my Eely? Where is he?

63
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,440
BABY: Come to Mommy! Come here!

64
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,840
There's my boy! Yes!

65
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,040
I have a date with destiny.

66
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,640
I want Lerigot's family
captured and bought here.

67
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,920
Yes, give Mommy a kiss. Yes. ( sniggers )

68
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,520
Oh... Oh...

69
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,320
Argh!

70
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,520
- ( growl )
- Argh!

71
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,320
Alpha... Alpha...

72
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,120
Alpha...

73
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,720
Alpha?

74
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,920
Alpha... Alpha...

75
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:40,120
Ai yi yi. Zordon! Lerigot,
the wizard of Liaria, is here on Earth!

76
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,520
Zordon? Zordon, where are you?!

77
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,120
I'm here, Alpha.

78
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:49,120
Zordon, you scared the diodes out of me!

79
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,920
I'm sorry, Alpha. I too sensed the arrival of
Lerigot ans was tracking his whereabouts.

80
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:58,720
But why would he come here? He knows
he can't survive on Earth for very long.

81
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,920
Something must be terribly wrong. Pinpoint
his location and contact the Rangers.

82
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:07,920
- If Lerigot is in trouble, we must help him.
- Right. Beginning a worldwide search now.

83
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,120
Rocky?

84
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,520
( voices )

85
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,720
Hey!

86
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,720
- Brought you a surprise.
- There you go. How you doin'?

87
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:36,120
- Got you a card.
- And some decoration.

88
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:43,920
- The doctor said you'd make a full recovery.
- Yeah, but not in time for the competition.

89
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,520
- You guys are gonna have to go without me.
- We don't have a choice.

90
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:51,120
Without that prize money
the shelter's gonna close for good.

91
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,720
You know, Justin's taking this pretty hard.

92
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,920
It's bad enough he lost his mother.
Now he has to face losing the shelter.

93
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,520
- Well, we're not gonna let that happen.
- ( communicators bleep )

94
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,520
- Go ahead.
- Rangers, report to the Power Chamber.

95
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,720
A powerful wizard has arrived on Earth
and may be in danger.

96
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,520
We're on our way. Tommy out.

97
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:15,120
You guys heard Zordon.
What are you waiting for?

98
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,120
- All right. We'll let you know what's up.
- See you, Rocky.

99
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,520
- We'll be back, OK?
- Be careful.

100
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,720
- Ow!
- Who's there?

101
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,320
Justin?

102
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,920
Did you just hear all that?

103
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,320
You guys are the Power Rangers?

104
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:52,320
Lerigot has taken great pains to hide his
exact location. Someone must be after him.

105
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,720
You must find him quickly.

106
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,720
- Tanya and I will stay here just in case.
- Good idea, Adam.

107
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:01,320
- This could be trouble. Keep an eye out.
- He is in Central Africa.

108
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,920
Equip yourselves with the Power Boxes
and teleport there immediately.

109
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,320
- Right.
- He cannot survive the sun's rays.

110
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,120
Ai yi yi!

111
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:18,720
The short-range locators in your Power
Boxes should lead you to Lerigot. Good Luck.

112
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,520
- Ready?
- Let's go.

113
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,320
Ow!

114
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,120
Alpha?

115
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,720
Alpha?

116
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,720
Alpha...

117
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,520
I've found Lerigot. He's on Earth.

118
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:53,520
Yes! He must be looking for Zordon.

119
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,920
Excellent. You may kiss my hand. Gotcha!

120
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:00,720
Earth? Forget it. Let's go back
to looting and pillaging. That's what I like!

121
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,920
Never! Lerigot holds
the only key to free Maligore,

122
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,320
the great flame of destruction
and my husband-to-be.

123
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:13,320
Once we are wed, I will use his powers
to raid all the riches of the universe.

124
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,720
Thinking about it
just gives me goose bumps!

125
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,320
- Kinda gives me gas.
- Elgar!

126
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:23,520
You will head the capture of two...
two humans of purity and strength.

127
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:28,320
They'll be my dowry to Maligore. Activate
the barrier shields and set a course to Earth.

128
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,720
We're going after Lerigot!

129
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,120
Prepare to teleport!

130
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,320
Hey, hold it. What you got there?

131
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,520
- Just as I thought.
- What is this? Huh?

132
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,920
- I'll check these hot dogs.
- Bulkmeier! Skullovitch!

133
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,320
Beat it, kid.

134
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,120
Sir!

135
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:24,120
Men, listen up, because you know how I hate
to repeat myself. I hate to repeat myself.

136
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,520
You just did, sir.

137
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,920
I needn't remind you
of our luck in getting rehired, Men...

138
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:36,720
I have am important assignment for you.
It's am easy one, but one that will, uh...

139
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,920
- Skullovitch, are you listening to me?
- Yep, I'm with you, sir.

140
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,920
Well, listen to this. Precisely at 1900 hours,

141
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,720
you relieve me from duty at the international
danceathon. Do I make myself clear?

142
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,720
- Got it, sir!
- Yes, sir!

143
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,920
Would you mind, sir?

144
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,520
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

145
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,920
- Napkin?
- Got one, sir. Thanks.

146
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,720
Wow. Reminds me of parts of Australia.

147
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,520
Got him. The signal's coming from...

148
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,120
that direction. Let's go find him.

149
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,920
Wow, this is moving fast.
Adam, come check this out.

150
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:45,720
That object we're tracking just entered Earth's
atmosphere. But its identity is being blocked.

151
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,520
It is likely the reason Lerigot cam to Earth.
An evil energy surrounds it.

152
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:54,720
Man, I've got a bad feeling about this.
I hope Tommy and Kat make it back soon.

153
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:59,520
Lt Stone is already gonna kill us
for bein' late, so turn right!

154
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,520
Left! Left is north. North Star!

155
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,520
- Look at the stars there, man!
- That star?

156
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,120
- That star!
- That star is moving! Wanna make a wish?

157
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,320
( horrified cries )

158
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,120
- What the heck was that?!
- I dunno, but keep going!

159
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:25,320
- The accelerator's stuck!
- Whoa. Stop! Skull, slow down, man!

160
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:29,520
- I'm trying!
- Skull, there's a building up ahead.

161
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,120
Aaarghhh!

162
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,120
( rumbling )

163
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,280
Lerigot's signal is gettin' stronger.

164
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,280
Tommy, do you mind if we stop for a minute?

165
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,680
- You OK?
- Yeah, it's just hot out here.

166
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,680
I know. Want some water?

167
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,280
We still have a lot of jungle to cover.

168
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,080
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

169
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:40,080
Man, this heat's intense.

170
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,280
Don't move.

171
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:05,880
On the count of three, jump away.

172
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,080
One.

173
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,480
Two.

174
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,280
Three!

175
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,480
Kat!

176
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,080
Tommy!

177
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,680
Kat!

178
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,680
( Kat screams )

179
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,880
Zeo Ranger One! Pink!

180
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,480
Kat!

181
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,880
Kat!

182
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,080
Kat!

183
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,280
Kat!

184
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,480
My leg!

185
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,480
- Are you OK?
- Yeah. Are you?

186
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,480
- Yeah.
- My leg...

187
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,480
DIVATOX: What do you mean,
you can't find Lerigot?!

188
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,480
And are these
my humans of purity and strength?

189
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:05,280
Yeah. Check 'em out. I even scrambled their
brains so they'd be easier to deal with. Ta-da!

190
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,280
- What do you think?
- Urrrgh!

191
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,080
Are you out of your mind?

192
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:14,280
- ( embarrassed laugh )
- The idea was to woo Maligore,

193
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,280
not make him lose his lunch!

194
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,480
I am giving you one more chance.

195
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,880
Don't blow it.

196
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:29,280
Yes, ma'am. Hey, you heard the lady.
Go find me some more humans, you losers!

197
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,480
Oh, man.

198
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,680
We're headed in the right direction
but the signal's gettin' fainter.

199
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:44,880
He must be weakening from the sun's heat.
Tommy, we've gotta hurry.

200
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,080
Let's go.

201
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,480
Look.

202
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,880
Lerigot.

203
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,480
Lerigot!

204
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,200
Alpha?

205
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,880
Alpha?

206
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,480
Yes.

207
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,680
Alpha.

208
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,080
My name is Tommy, and this is Katherine.
We're friends.

209
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,480
- We're here to take you to Alpha.
- Alpha...

210
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,280
My leg!

211
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,880
He healed my leg.

212
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:14,880
- Thank you, Lerigot.
- Let's get him outta here.

213
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,280
It's OK.

214
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:32,280
Alpha, we're standing by
with Lerigot for teleportation.

215
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,880
Thank you.

216
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,200
Well, what do we have here?

217
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:09,000
Two humans, ripe for the picking,
and they're heading our way! ( cackles )

218
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,600
Two perfect specimens,
worthy of feeding my fiancé.

219
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,800
Throw them into the bilge,
where they'll stay fresh for Maligore.

220
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,200
It'll be my pleasure.

221
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:12,000
Now let's reel, in that little runt Lerigot.

222
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
He's probably with Zordon by now.
Remove the mind block.

223
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,600
We'll use his wife Yara to contact them both.

224
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:32,400
- Is he going to be all right?
- The sun has taken its toll on him.

225
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,600
- This should restore his life force... for now.
- I wonder who's after him.

226
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,400
( moaning ) Yara...

227
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,800
- What's happening?
- Tommy, wait.

228
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:49,200
Lerigot is receiving a telepathic transmission
that is obviously upsetting him greatly.

229
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,600
Zordon, what should we do?

230
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,600
Perhaps if we find out
what he is receiving, we can help him.

231
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:58,800
Alpha, attach the cranial transmission
scanner and connect it to the viewing globe.

232
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,800
- Ai yi yi!
- Zordon, I know you can hear me,

233
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,600
so listen well.

234
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,000
Lerigot must surrender.

235
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Say hello to Lerigot's family.

236
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,400
Yara, loving wife,

237
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,400
and caring mother to little baby Bethel.

238
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,000
Don't you just want to pinch
those adorable cheeks?

239
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,600
- Ai yi yi yi yi!
- Make it stop! Look what it's doing to him!

240
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:27,000
Bring him to me. Oh, and by the way,
as a token of my appreciation,

241
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,000
I'll spare a couple
of your favourite humans.

242
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:35,400
They're certainly not much to look at, but my
sensors tell me they were once one of your...

243
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:39,000
Oh, what do you call them?
Oh, yes. "Power Rangers."

244
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,800
- Kimberly.
- Do what I say or it's lights out for all of them.

245
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,000
And Jason.

246
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,600
Yara...

247
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,800
- Kim?
- Yeah?

248
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,800
I think we're in major trouble here.

249
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,600
I'd say.

250
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,000
Wish we could morph.

251
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,200
Doesn't look like there's any way out.

252
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,600
- Hola!
- Ja. Guten Tag.

253
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,600
( Spanish accent ) My name
is Antonio Bandanna.

254
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,400
- Bulk?
- Skull?

255
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,600
( German accent ) You are speaking to us?

256
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:28,200
Who ees this "Bulk" and "Skull"?

257
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:33,600
- Something's strange with those two.
- You just figured that one out?

258
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,400
( both speaking Liarian )

259
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,200
- They understand each other.
- As good friends should.

260
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,200
I don't understand it.
Why does Divatox want Lerigot?

261
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:53,400
I believe that Divatox plans
to use Lerigot and his golden key

262
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:57,000
to cross the treacherous Nemesis Triangle
into another dimension.

263
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,600
Once there, she will likely travel
to the lost island of Muiranthias

264
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:04,800
and attempt to join forces
with an evil creature named Maligore.

265
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,800
- Great. Then what?
- Then nothing will be safe.

266
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:11,400
- Even the Zords could not stop them.
- What? No!

267
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:15,600
- What's he doing?
- Ai yi yi!

268
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:21,600
He is performing the Liarian prayer of
guidance. Lerigot is preparing to surrender.

269
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,800
- But why? We can't let him do that.
- It's his family, Kat.

270
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,400
- We'd do the same for each other.
- I just hope they're OK.

271
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,800
OK, listen. We'll get Kim and Jason out
of there, then we'll go after Lerigot's family.

272
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:39,600
Kimberly and Jason were Power Rangers
once. If anyone can get through it, they can.

273
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:57,000
Careful. Watch your step.

274
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,400
Look. There they are.

275
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,800
Warriors, let's ride!

276
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,600
Send Lerigot down!

277
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:40,800
No! Bring our friends closer first!

278
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:44,400
You have no choice, humans!

279
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
This is as close as you get!
Now send the wizard down!

280
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,200
I don't like it. We should stall them
and figure something out.

281
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,200
Yeah, I think maybe you're right.

282
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,600
Lerigot's gone!

283
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,400
- Lerigot! No!
- Come back!

284
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:13,200
Come on, fur ball. Come to Elgar. ( sniggers )

285
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,800
All right! You have what you came for!
Let our friends go!

286
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:21,000
Swim for 'em! Arrivederci, turkeys!

287
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:39,000
All right, stop the boat.
You can dump them out right here.

288
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:47,400
Come and get 'em!
All right, take us back to the ship.

289
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,400
Move it!

290
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,200
I gotta go... I gotta go after 'em!

291
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,400
- No! It's a fake!
- Tommy! Tommy!

292
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,400
- I gotta check the other one.
- Tommy...

293
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:16,200
Come on. They're gone.
Tommy, come on! Come on!

294
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:21,000
- I gotta... gotta go after 'em...
- They tricked us.

295
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,400
Double, double rocks and rubble!

296
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,600
Abracadabra-cadabra-
cadabra-cadabra-cadabra-whoo!

297
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:51,000
If only its magic would glow in my hands,
I would have no need for you.

298
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:57,600
You will oversee our safe passage
into the Nemesis Triangle, won't you, twerp?

299
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:04,200
Set a course for me Nemesis Triangle!
Full speed ahead!

300
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:17,400
Once we get to the island of Muiranthias
on the other side...

301
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,200
( fly buzzing )

302
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,000
As I was saying.

303
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,000
- Once we get to the island of Muira...
- ( fly buzzing )

304
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,800
My Maligore's appetite will ignite

305
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:50,400
once he sees the powerlicious
offerings I've brought him.

306
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:55,800
Those two ex-Power Pukes will be the
perfect wedding meal for my Maligore!

307
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:56,550
OK.

308
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:04,200
This is so lame. We come back to surprise
everybody and help out with the shelter...

309
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:08,400
Next thing, we're snack food
for a monster with the munchies.

310
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,160
Munchies?

311
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:16,080
Level stabilisers off at 8.40.

312
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,480
- Full throttle on the power output.
- OK, all systems go here.

313
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:23,280
The Zords you are creating will possess
the power to carry you safely

314
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:28,080
through the Nemesis Triangle
to resuce Lerigot, his family and our friends.

315
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:31,080
Behold your new Turbo Zords.

316
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:34,080
They're just ordinary cars.

317
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,280
No, Tanya, they are extraordinary cars.

318
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:41,880
Vehicles equipped with the power
and velocity of Turbo technology.

319
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:45,480
Individually, they are
formidable fighting machines.

320
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:50,880
But merged together they form the Turbo
Megazord, the most powerful Zord ever.

321
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:59,880
Adam, Desert Thunder
will be yours to command.

322
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,480
Katherine, yours is called Wind Chaser.

323
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,480
Tanya, Dune Star is your Turbo Zord.

324
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,880
And, Tommy,
Red Lightning will serve you well.

325
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:13,680
Thanks, Zordon.

326
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:19,680
- But what about Rocky's?
- Mountain Blaster will stay behind for now.

327
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,880
Remember, Rangers.
Once inside the Nemesis Triangle,

328
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:27,480
communication with the Power Chamber
will be impossible.

329
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:33,480
ZORDON: Here are your new Turbo morphers,
five keys similar to Lerigot's golden key.

330
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:38,880
Individually, they power up your vehicles and
give you access to your morphing powers.

331
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:43,680
But only together are they powerful enough
to see you safely through your mission.

332
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:47,880
Now reach out, Rangers,
and accept your destiny.

333
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,680
Ready?

334
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,480
Ready.

335
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,880
Go!

336
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:07,080
Whoa! I've never felt anything like this!

337
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,880
Wow! This is great!

338
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,880
- All right!
- This is awesome!

339
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,680
- Whoa! This is incredible!
- Yeah!

340
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:17,280
- All right, guys, let's go to work.
- Right behind you.

341
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,680
- Wait for me!
- Let's do it!

342
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,480
All systems check out. Your Zords
are programmed and ready to go.

343
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:29,880
Take your Zords across the great desert to the
sea. There you will find the Ghost Galleon,

344
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:34,080
a phantom ship which will take you
and the Zords through the Nemesis Triangle.

345
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:37,680
You must merge the power of your keys
the moment you cross into the Triangle.

346
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:41,880
The combined power of your keys
and the Galleon will see you through safely.

347
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,880
Neither the ship nor your Zords
will be detectable by Divatox.

348
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,880
- Ai yi yi! Good luck, Rangers!
- Thanks, Alpha.

349
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:52,080
- Good luck, and may power protect you.
- All right, Rangers. Power up!

350
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,280
( # "Power Rangers Turbo, Go!"
by Super Power )

351
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:10,800
# Go #

352
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,680
# Go! #

353
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,080
# Power Rangers Turbo, go! #

354
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:20,280
- Man, this is awesome!
- Desert Thunder ready to rumble.

355
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,880
- Wind Chaser ready to howl.
- Dune Star's gonna shine.

356
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,880
- Red Lightning ready to bolt.
- ADAM: All systems go.

357
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,480
All right. Let's rip some velocity!
Shift into Turbo!

358
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:36,840
# Power Rangers Turbo, go! #

359
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:42,240
By accepting this honour, you are
also accepting a great responsibility.

360
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,240
As the newest Ranger,
you must take your lead from the others

361
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:48,240
and learn to use your new powers wisely.

362
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:52,440
You will command the Mountain Blaster
and be henceforth known as the Blue Ranger.

363
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:56,040
Good luck, and may the power protect you.

364
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,440
No Power Rangers in sight.

365
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:11,640
I knew Zordon would get it
through his thick skull not to mess with me.

366
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:15,240
I'm no veterinarian, but I think it's dying.

367
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:20,640
Oh! We can't let that wretched Liarian thingy
die till he opens the gateway to Muiranthias

368
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,040
and frees my betrothed!

369
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:58,440
You guys? I hear the ocean,
but... I don't see the ship.

370
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,840
I'll take a look up ahead.

371
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,840
I think I found it.

372
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:09,240
The Ghost Galleon.

373
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:11,040
It's amazing.

374
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,440
( engine revs )

375
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,840
Hey, guys, check it out.

376
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,440
Rocky?

377
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,440
Wow. Cool.

378
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:39,840
Justin, what are you doing here?
- Rocky couldn't make it, so they sent me.

379
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:43,440
- What are you talking about?
- Guys, I'm the new Blue Ranger!

380
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,840
Isn't that cool or what?

381
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:50,040
- What?
- Man, I was afraid I wasn't gonna make it.

382
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,440
Alpha had to give me
a crash course in driving.

383
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:55,440
Good thing you don't need
a licence to drive a Zord.

384
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,440
So, what are we doing here?

385
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:05,040
We'll talk about this later. Right now
we gotta get those cars on that ship.

386
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,760
Let's go.

387
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,760
- OK. Everybody on board?
- Yep, we're all here.

388
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:25,160
Let's check out the ship.

389
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,760
Hey, you guys, look at this!

390
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,360
I guess we should open it.

391
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:13,160
Looks like the portal keys
also control the ship.

392
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:15,560
Let's do it.

393
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:34,760
Hey, the compass is moving.

394
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:46,160
- And the sails! They're all raising...
- By themselves!

395
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,960
( # "Hope for the World" by The Mighty RAW # )

396
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:09,560
# There's hope for the world #

397
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:12,560
# Hope for the world #

398
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,960
# Hope for the world #

399
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,960
# Hope for the world #

400
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,160
# And as long as I exist #

401
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,760
# There's hope for the world #

402
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:31,160
# Hope for the world #

403
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:53,360
- Do I look fat?
- Nah!

404
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:58,160
( alarm sounds )

405
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:01,760
Hell's bells, what is going on now?

406
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:05,360
Sensors detect the presence
of five humans, but no vessel.

407
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:10,160
What, are they swimmimg?
We're in the middle of the blasted ocean!

408
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:13,760
Whatever they're travelling on
is totally undetectable.

409
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:17,360
Zordon's little Power Pukes, no doubt.

410
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,760
Why didn't the radar alert us?

411
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:25,160
I guess it needs fixing.

412
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,360
Never mind.

413
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:37,160
I'll just leave a little something for
those Power Parasites to remember me by.

414
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,760
KAT: Justin, where are you?

415
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,760
- Justin?
- I'm over here.

416
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:42,560
Why don't you come down below with us?
It's getting pretty cold out here.

417
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:45,560
I'm way too excited to sleep.

418
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:47,960
I was just thinking.

419
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:49,760
If my dad only knew,

420
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:54,560
man, he'd be so proud of me.
And all the other kids at the shelter...

421
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,960
- Justin, you can't...
- I know, I know.

422
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,960
It's for me to know and them to find out.

423
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,760
Ranger's code of honour.

424
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:05,960
- I won't tell anybody.
- Good.

425
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,360
I guess my dad's still up north.

426
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:16,160
He had to close down the martial-arts studio
after my mom passed away.

427
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:18,560
Why'd he close it down?

428
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:22,160
He just... He just couldn't focus any more.

429
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:25,760
It was like something
was missing inside him.

430
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:29,360
He'll find it again.
He just needs a little time, that's all.

431
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:34,160
I know. And when he does,
we can be family again.

432
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:35,960
That's important.

433
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:40,760
Yeah, it is. But you have to remember
that we've your family now too.

434
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:42,560
Come here.

435
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:50,360
OK. don't stay out too long.
Even Power Rangers need their sleep.

436
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:51,110
OK.

437
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:09,560
- He's OK.
- Good.

438
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:46,160
( croaking whisper ) Help...

439
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:48,560
Guys... Hey, guys...

440
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:52,160
OK, once we get there, we'll nead
to the middle of the island...

441
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:56,000
Justin?

442
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:05,960
Adam, look out!

443
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:14,360
- Guys! It's time to rumble.
- Let's go.

444
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:18,560
Justin!

445
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:29,360
Look out!

446
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:55,160
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

447
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:05,360
Aw... Ugh!

448
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:19,760
Boo!

449
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:28,160
( splash )

450
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:36,480
- This sure ain't the Love Boat.
- What's the Love Boat?

451
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:08,280
That's it. Kim, move away
from the wall for a minute.

452
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:08,880
Um, sure.

453
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:17,280
Instead of making weapons, I think we ought
to be concentrating on getting this panel off.

454
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:21,480
Wouldn't that mean
all the water would come in?

455
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:25,680
Yeah. Right now my dive computer says
we're at 435 feet.

456
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:28,680
As we get to Muiranthias,
the sub's gonna climb.

457
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:31,680
Once we hit 100 feet,
we pop this off the wall and "boom".

458
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:33,480
- And make it up in one breath?
- It's our only chance.

459
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:56,880
At last! We're finally approaching
the Nemesis Triangle!

460
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:02,880
- Begin our ascent! We must avoid the reets!
- You got it.

461
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:25,080
- Wait till we cross the Triangle.
- We'd better pass through it quickly!

462
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:32,280
There it is. The Nemesis Triangle.

463
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:35,880
It's incredible.

464
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:40,080
Yeah. Whatever's steering the ship
sure knows where to go.

465
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:42,480
Right into the heart of it.

466
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:53,280
It's time.

467
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:02,880
- The room's filling up! What's happening?
- I don't know!

468
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:07,680
We're minutes away
from the dimensional gateway.

469
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:14,280
I don't know how much longer I can hold it.

470
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:17,880
Look out!

471
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:25,680
- Tell me I'm not seeing things.
- No. It's the Triangle.

472
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:27,480
Looks pretty nasty.

473
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:29,880
Hit the deck!

474
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:44,280
Do it, wizard. Open the gateway.

475
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:47,880
Come on, come on. Do it!

476
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:53,280
You little fool! Open the chamber!

477
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:58,080
ELGAR: Don't move, you little hair ball!

478
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:05,280
You may be willing to sacrifice yourself, runt.
But how much do you love your little family?

479
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:08,880
- Elgar! Grab the baby!
- Right! Come here, you little brat.

480
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:13,080
( screams )

481
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:17,280
Well? What will it be?

482
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:19,680
That's better. Yeah.

483
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:24,480
Open the gateway!

484
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:35,280
Get to it.

485
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:59,880
( Divatox cackles )

486
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,880
- We need something to pry it with!
- Get the pipe.

487
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:16,080
Good idea.

488
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:26,280
This should do it.

489
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:34,080
- OK. Any time, Jason.
- I'm trying!

490
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:37,080
OK. This water's getting too high for me.

491
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:41,880
- We go swimming?
- Would you guys be quiet?!

492
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:44,880
I'm trying to get us out of here!

493
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:58,680
We're sinking. We're sinking.
OK, OK, don't panic. Don't panic.

494
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:01,080
We're sinking!

495
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:03,480
Oh, we're sinking. Gotta go!

496
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:08,280
- For some reason, we're taking on water.
- Water? Water?!

497
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:10,680
Water!

498
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:19,680
We're close to the gatway.
We need the keys.

499
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:23,280
- You guys go below. I'll get the keys.
- Be careful.

500
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:43,080
OK. Ready?

501
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:44,880
Now!

502
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:50,880
My key! I dropped my key!

503
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:53,280
My key!

504
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:01,680
- I can't reach it!
- Hurry, Justin!

505
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:08,280
I got it! Yes!

506
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:10,080
Come on! Hurry!

507
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:13,080
Let's do it.

508
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:51,480
( coughing )

509
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:55,680
We gotta get Bulk and Skull first. OK?

510
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:44,280
You guys? You have to exhale slowly
on your way to the top.

511
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:46,680
Swim now, like a little guppy.

512
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:28,680
What?! It's coming from the bilge!
Activate the emergency hatch!

513
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:31,680
- Right.
- Now!

514
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:32,880
- Quicker!
- OK.

515
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:52,680
Hope that drain's not clogged.

516
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:08,280
Now open the hatch to the bilge. Hurry up!

517
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:15,480
Well, I suppose Maligore
will have to do with just one sacrifice.

518
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:39,760
Man.

519
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:42,760
Wow. Land ahoy.

520
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:49,360
Thar she blows! Land ahoy!
Shiver me timbers!

521
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:51,760
I always wanted to say that.

522
00:58:57,160 --> 00:59:00,760
There it is. The lost island of Muiranthias.

523
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:03,760
Yep, looks pretty lost to me.

524
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:08,560
Maligore's volcano is inside the serpant's
temple. That's gotta be where they're going.

525
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:11,560
Then that's where we're goin' too.

526
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:34,960
Your evergrown hamster ain't lookin' so hot.

527
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:39,760
No! He must live long enough
to open Maligore's sacred temple door.

528
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:41,560
( alarm )

529
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:43,360
Now what?

530
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:48,760
This is impossible! Our radar is detecting
five human life forms approaching the island!

531
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:51,160
I knew they wouldn't let me down, Divatox.

532
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:57,160
- I have to get rid of those Power Rangers!
- Yeah, they're gettin' on my nerves.

533
00:59:58,360 --> 01:00:00,160
( phone rings )

534
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:04,360
Hi, Rita. D here.

535
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:07,360
Sorry to wake you.
I forgot about the time change.

536
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:10,960
Now listen. I know you've had
some experience in this matter.

537
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:13,960
I need your advice.
How do I get rid of the Power Rangers?

538
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:17,560
The Power Rangers? ( laughs )

539
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:22,360
If I knew that, do you think
I'd be lying here listening to this?

540
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:25,360
( snores )

541
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:28,960
My advice to you, Divatox?

542
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:30,160
Run!

543
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:32,560
( cackles )

544
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:35,560
Thanks for nothing.

545
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:07,360
What are you doing?

546
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:09,760
Stop it!

547
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:12,760
Let go of me! Stop it!

548
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:16,960
- She should have better camoutlage.
- What should we do?

549
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:20,560
We could resuce her.
Or we could enjoy is beach.

550
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:30,160
( both yell with terror )

551
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:53,560
Guys, something's wrong.
I can't get a lock on Lerigot.

552
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:58,360
Desert Thunder's up first. I'll drive to the top
of that cliff and see if I can see the temple.

553
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:01,960
Good. Keep in contact.
We'll get the other vehicles rolling.

554
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:03,760
Be careful.

555
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:45,760
Uh-oh.

556
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:48,160
Hey!

557
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:07,360
DIVATOX: They've gotta be riding something!
A couple of torpedoes will find out what.

558
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:10,960
Two torpedoes are armed and ready.
Fire one and two!

559
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:31,360
Cool view.

560
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:52,960
- Our cover's blown. Something's coming.
- And it's coming fast.

561
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:55,360
We can't be detected in the Turbo vehicles.

562
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:58,360
Come on! We gotta
get our butts in those cars!

563
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:03,680
Hey, guys!

564
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:19,280
No...

565
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:21,080
Whatever it was, we hit it!

566
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:40,280
- Looks like we all got through.
- All right!

567
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:43,880
- So what do you think, Justin?
- Wow! Can we do that again?

568
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:45,680
Head for shore.

569
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:54,680
Yeah!

570
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:24,680
Come on! I haven't got all day!

571
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:47,480
Oh, man.

572
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:16,880
- Where is it? My feet hurt.
- Stop complaining. We're almost there.

573
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:19,280
Wimp.

574
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:24,680
- Move it, prisoner.
- ( drumming )

575
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:28,880
I don't like the sound of that.

576
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:34,880
Come to think of it,
I don't like the looks of it either.

577
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:49,880
Hey, the little Power Geek's back.

578
01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:56,480
- So, you want a fight, huh?
- No, no, no. Wait, wait!

579
01:06:56,480 --> 01:07:00,080
Those are the Malachians, guardians
of Maligore. Get the wizard. Bring him.

580
01:07:00,680 --> 01:07:03,080
OK. Release the wizard!

581
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:07,880
Would you hurry up?

582
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:09,680
Here.

583
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:12,680
Do it, wizard. Spin your magic.

584
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:16,880
Lerigot...

585
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:24,080
Move it, fur ball.

586
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:36,680
- The little guy packs a punch!
- Give me that!

587
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:41,480
What a rush! That's right,
bow to me, you little peons.

588
01:07:42,680 --> 01:07:46,880
I love being queen. All right, come on,
everybody. We've got a wedding to get to.

589
01:07:48,080 --> 01:07:49,880
Here comes the bride!

590
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:52,280
Watch it, shorty.

591
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:54,680
Get going. Come on!

592
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:00,680
Warriors, bring the others.

593
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:04,880
Move it.

594
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:07,880
What are you lookin' at? Get inside!

595
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:14,560
- Guys! We gotta hurry!
- Are you all right?

596
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:16,960
Lerigot's dying.
We may already be too late.

597
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:19,960
All right. We'll leave the vehicles,
go for a silent approach.

598
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:24,160
Take out your morphers.
It's time to kick into action. Shift into Turbo!

599
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:26,560
Yeah! Oops.

600
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:32,560
Mountain Blaster Turbo power!

601
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:42,160
Desert Thunder Turbo power!

602
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:47,560
Dune Star Turbo power!

603
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:54,160
Wind Chaser Turbo power!

604
01:08:57,760 --> 01:09:00,160
Red Lightning Turbo power!

605
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:08,560
- Let's do it!
- Right!

606
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:11,560
- Right!
- Whoa! All right!

607
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:14,240
Hey, wait for me!

608
01:09:19,640 --> 01:09:21,440
I like it.

609
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:28,040
I love it, I love it.
Oh, the steaming skulls - perfect!

610
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:34,640
Put her down over there.

611
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:38,840
Come on!

612
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:40,640
Don't move.

613
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:44,240
Lerigot... Lerigot...

614
01:09:46,040 --> 01:09:49,040
The lava will have to go,
but we'll do all our entertaining here.

615
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:52,040
Of course, you won't be around to see it.

616
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:55,040
All right! It's time to feed my future husband!

617
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:01,040
Prepare the humans first!

618
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:03,440
On your feet!

619
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:08,240
He can have the Liarians for dessert.

620
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:13,640
If anyone knows a reason why we two
should not be joined in holy matrimony,

621
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:15,440
shut up!

622
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:26,240
- Sure beats walking.
- You can say that again.

623
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:37,040
Hear that? We're close. Keep your eyes open.

624
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:44,840
- Tommy! Over here!
- What's wrong?

625
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:47,240
- You OK?
- The sound's coming from that way.

626
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:50,840
- Good job, Justin.
- This is fun! Follow me, I'll lead the way.

627
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:57,440
- Justin, wait! It's too dangerous!
- I found the entrance!

628
01:10:58,040 --> 01:10:59,840
( chanting ) Maligore! Maligore!

629
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:06,440
Maligore, great flame of destruction,

630
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:10,640
it is I, Divatox,

631
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:13,640
your one and only true soul mate.

632
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:16,040
This moment has been long in coming,

633
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:21,440
and now I bring you two perfect specimens
to seal our matrimonial pact.

634
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:26,240
Awake and feed upon their purity.

635
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:29,840
Come forth and let evil twist their souls!

636
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:34,640
Be free again and join forces with me!

637
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:36,440
( Divatox cackles )

638
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:40,040
( chanting ) Maligore! Maligore!

639
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:45,440
- All right, guys, this is it. You guys ready?
- Ready.

640
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:51,440
Move out on my command.

641
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:56,240
Go!

642
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:04,640
Hey, did we miss the party?

643
01:12:05,240 --> 01:12:06,440
Who invited you?

644
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:10,640
We did. Rangers, this is Divatox.

645
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:13,640
Divatox, this is your worst nightmare.

646
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:14,840
Hah!

647
01:12:14,840 --> 01:12:17,840
Lower them into the volcano.

648
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:23,240
I'll get the wheel!

649
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:50,840
Divatox! Give up?

650
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:54,440
Elgar, go and give Power Boy my answer!

651
01:12:56,840 --> 01:12:59,840
Come back, you little twerp!

652
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:11,840
What's the matter? All choked up?

653
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:14,840
Come on, Lerigot. Over here.

654
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:19,040
Wait here. I'll be back as soon as I can.

655
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:33,440
- Kim!
- Into the fire!

656
01:13:36,440 --> 01:13:38,840
- You guys!
- Get... outta... my... way!

657
01:13:54,440 --> 01:13:56,840
- No! Let me go!
- Help! You guys!

658
01:13:57,440 --> 01:14:01,640
Too late, Rangers. Even now
they are becoming his spawns of evil.

659
01:14:06,440 --> 01:14:08,840
I love it when a plan comes together!

660
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:17,240
Kimberly! Jason!

661
01:14:17,240 --> 01:14:20,840
That's a nice trick.

662
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:32,240
Maligore's children! Destroy those
who would threaten the flames of unity!

663
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:35,840
Kim!

664
01:14:36,440 --> 01:14:38,240
Stop!

665
01:14:41,240 --> 01:14:43,640
Leave him alone!

666
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:47,240
Kim!

667
01:14:47,240 --> 01:14:49,640
Snap out of... urgh!

668
01:14:57,440 --> 01:14:59,240
Let... go... of... me...

669
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:05,840
- Kim, you've gotta fight the evil.
- Evil is like evil does.

670
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:08,240
Don't do this!

671
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:11,240
No!

672
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:14,240
Leave her alone. Kimberly, no!

673
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:17,840
No.

674
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:20,840
Look at me, Kim. Look at me.

675
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:23,240
It's me.

676
01:15:23,240 --> 01:15:25,640
- It's me. Tommy.
- Yes. We're your friends.

677
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:27,440
Friends?

678
01:15:28,040 --> 01:15:29,840
I don't have any friends.

679
01:15:32,240 --> 01:15:34,040
Wait.

680
01:15:34,040 --> 01:15:37,040
Oh, yeah. And, sweetie, pink is out.

681
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:45,440
- You're mine, Ranger!
- No. I don't wanna hurt you.

682
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:13,040
Into the fire. Into the fire.

683
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:17,840
Do it. Do it. Maligore's power will exceed!
Throw him in the fire!

684
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:20,840
No! This one is mine!

685
01:16:26,240 --> 01:16:30,440
- Throw him in the fire! Throw him in the fire!
- Yes. Into the fire.

686
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:37,040
( gasps )

687
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:45,440
Now I'm the one
with the muscles and the power!

688
01:16:46,040 --> 01:16:49,640
Yeah, that's right, Jase.
But you're not using your brain power!

689
01:16:56,840 --> 01:16:59,240
- Come on!
- Tommy! Hang on!

690
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:02,240
Come on, Jason. Don't fight me.

691
01:17:02,240 --> 01:17:05,240
You gotta remember.
Remember all the good!

692
01:17:06,440 --> 01:17:08,840
- No!
- You got it. Come on.

693
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:11,240
No!

694
01:17:13,640 --> 01:17:16,040
- All right, Kim?
- I'm with you!

695
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:32,240
- I think you're gonna need this.
- Yeah. Thanks.

696
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:35,240
Back to action!

697
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:39,440
- I'll get the Liarians.
- Right. Let's finish up, guys.

698
01:17:44,240 --> 01:17:47,240
- Watch it, you Christmas tree ornament!
- Sorry about that.

699
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:50,840
Maligore! Arise and meet your bride!

700
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:55,640
Together we will exact revenge on Lerigot,
descendant of those who imprisoned you!

701
01:17:55,640 --> 01:17:59,840
Come to me! Please! Aw, come on.

702
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:03,440
- The humans are turning pure again!
- No!

703
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:08,240
- Now we don't have a sacrifice!
- Oh, but we do, dear nephew.

704
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:11,840
We do?

705
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:14,240
Bye.

706
01:18:17,240 --> 01:18:20,240
Remind me to get another pet.

707
01:18:38,240 --> 01:18:40,040
Out of my face.

708
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:43,640
Excuse me.

709
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:48,440
- Why, thank you.
- Any time.

710
01:18:56,840 --> 01:18:58,640
Man! Tough room.

711
01:19:00,440 --> 01:19:02,160
Straighten up! He's coming.

712
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:07,560
I don't think I like this one bit.

713
01:19:12,360 --> 01:19:16,560
Come to me, Maligore!
Unite our powers as one!

714
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:35,760
Get ready to take this freak.

715
01:19:41,160 --> 01:19:42,960
He's back!

716
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:48,960
She wants to marry him?

717
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:53,160
Are you sure about this?

718
01:19:53,160 --> 01:19:57,960
- I think it's time to break out the hardware.
- Good call, Justin. Let's do it!

719
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:08,160
- Turbo lightning sword!
- Turbo hand blasters!

720
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:10,560
Turbo star chargers!

721
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:15,360
Talk to him.

722
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:17,760
- Turbo thunder cannon!
- Turbo wind fire!

723
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:23,160
You look... great. Haven't changed a bit.

724
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:29,160
Fire!

725
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:37,560
It's not working!

726
01:20:38,760 --> 01:20:40,560
Whoa! What a hot-head!

727
01:20:42,360 --> 01:20:44,760
What's the plan, Tommy?
That barely fazed him.

728
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:47,160
Lure brimstone-breath outside
and call our Zords.

729
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:50,760
- All right! I was hoping you'd say that!
- Let's do it!

730
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:04,560
Adam! Get up!

731
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:08,160
Oh, man! I can't move!

732
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:11,760
- Come on! You can do it!
- Hey, your bride's leaving.

733
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:15,960
I think I hear my mother calling.

734
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:19,560
- Made you look.
- You have no sense of direction!

735
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:21,360
And you're ugly.

736
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:27,960
Everyone! Out the way we came!
Adam, can you make it?

737
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:30,960
- Yeah.
- OK, let's go! Move it!

738
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:33,960
You OK?

739
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:42,960
We gotta get outta here. The place
is gonna blow. Come on! Move! Come on!

740
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:45,360
- Be careful!
- Come on, come on. Here we go.

741
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:20,160
- Head for the clearing.
- Got it.

742
01:22:20,160 --> 01:22:21,360
- Right behind you.
- Copt that.

743
01:22:21,960 --> 01:22:23,160
Yahoo!

744
01:22:35,160 --> 01:22:40,560
You're goin' on a diet the minute we get back.
Come on! We'll miss the whole fight.

745
01:22:51,480 --> 01:22:54,480
Let's see what this baby's got.
Ready to bring 'em together?

746
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:56,280
- Wind Chaser ready.
- Ready.

747
01:22:56,880 --> 01:22:57,480
- Ready!
- Ready!

748
01:22:58,080 --> 01:23:01,680
Do it! Turbo Megazord
morph sequence on line.

749
01:23:07,080 --> 01:23:10,080
Powering up the Turbo shield armour.
Desert Thunder's ready to rock!

750
01:23:10,680 --> 01:23:14,880
- Dune Star's right there with you.
- This is awesome! Mountain Blaster ready.

751
01:23:16,680 --> 01:23:19,080
# Mighty engines roar #

752
01:23:19,080 --> 01:23:21,480
# Turbocharged for more... #

753
01:23:22,680 --> 01:23:24,480
Initiate docking sequence now!

754
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:34,680
# Go! #

755
01:23:34,680 --> 01:23:37,080
# Power Rangers Turbo, go! #

756
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:38,280
# Power Rangers Turbo, go! #

757
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:41,280
Mountain Blaster's lined up and coming in!

758
01:23:53,880 --> 01:23:56,880
Red Lightning coming in
for final docking sequence.

759
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:18,480
# Go! #

760
01:24:18,480 --> 01:24:20,880
# Power Rangers Turbo, go! #

761
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:23,280
# Power Rangers Turbo, go! #

762
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:25,680
# Power Rangers Turbo! #

763
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:32,880
Megazord turbocharge!

764
01:24:38,280 --> 01:24:40,080
- Ready!
- Let's take care of business.

765
01:24:46,680 --> 01:24:48,480
Let's get him!

766
01:24:56,880 --> 01:24:58,680
Whoa! That was close.

767
01:24:58,680 --> 01:25:01,680
Maligore! Win this one for me, babe!

768
01:25:09,480 --> 01:25:10,680
We got him!

769
01:25:47,880 --> 01:25:48,480
- Ready to fly?
- Ready.

770
01:25:49,080 --> 01:25:52,080
All right. Engage mega Turbo jets now!

771
01:25:56,280 --> 01:25:58,080
Turbo jets full power!

772
01:26:07,680 --> 01:26:09,480
Later, flame-face!

773
01:26:26,280 --> 01:26:28,080
- Good job!
- We did it!

774
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:29,280
Yes! Yes!

775
01:26:35,880 --> 01:26:38,880
The volcano! It's erupting!
We'd better get out of here.

776
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:40,680
All my plans!

777
01:26:40,680 --> 01:26:44,280
The money! The jewels! The plastic surgery...

778
01:26:44,280 --> 01:26:47,280
I didn't even get a honeymoon!

779
01:26:49,680 --> 01:26:53,880
You mark my words, Rygog.
The Power Rangers will pay for this one day.

780
01:26:53,880 --> 01:26:58,680
- I never accept defeat!
- Right. No defeat. So what do we do now?

781
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:04,680
- Run!
- Right.

782
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:08,280
I want my mommy! Move it!

783
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:29,880
Hey, guys. How about a lift?

784
01:27:37,680 --> 01:27:39,480
All right. Here we go.

785
01:27:46,520 --> 01:27:50,120
PA: The competition is fierce, as
Angel Grove and Stone Canyon battle it out

786
01:27:50,120 --> 01:27:54,920
for the championship
and the $25,000 grand prize for their charity.

787
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:09,320
And Angel Grove scores the first point.

788
01:28:12,920 --> 01:28:14,720
Hey, Coach.

789
01:28:18,920 --> 01:28:21,320
Come on, Adam! Get up!

790
01:28:26,120 --> 01:28:30,920
Angel Grove scores again. One more point
and they clinch the championship!

791
01:29:05,120 --> 01:29:06,920
Point!

792
01:29:08,720 --> 01:29:09,920
I'm sorry.

793
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:17,120
After seven minutes and ten seconds
into the competition,

794
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:19,520
the National Championship title

795
01:29:20,120 --> 01:29:22,520
goes to the Angel Grove shelter!

796
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:26,720
( # Turbo Time" by Ellen ten Damme )

797
01:29:26,720 --> 01:29:29,720
- I knew they could do it!
- Come on.

798
01:29:38,720 --> 01:29:40,520
- Way to go, you guys!
- Yeah!

799
01:29:40,520 --> 01:29:44,120
That was so awesome! Way to go, you guys!

800
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:53,720
Well, looks like the shelter's
not closing any time soon.

801
01:29:53,720 --> 01:29:55,520
Come on, Justin.

802
01:29:57,320 --> 01:29:59,720
Yes! All right!

803
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:02,720
# Riding fast, faster fast #

804
01:30:02,720 --> 01:30:05,720
# Like turbo tigers in the night #

805
01:30:05,720 --> 01:30:08,720
# We are at top speed tracking you down #

806
01:30:08,720 --> 01:30:11,120
# Like turbo tigers in the darkest night #

807
01:30:11,120 --> 01:30:15,920
# Now it's turbo time! #
