1
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,559
Before the end
of the season last year...

2
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:49,279
...and then re-injured it
in spring training...

3
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,839
...on a terrific game-saving play.

4
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,958
You know, I was talking with...

5
00:00:53,959 --> 00:00:57,838
- What time is this going on?
- 7:30 is the pre-game.

6
00:00:57,839 --> 00:01:00,919
- Who'd you say was pitching?
- Tiant's pitching.

7
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:04,958
- Goddamn Cuban. He can hurl it.
- I'd hate to be facing him.

8
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:08,039
- Who are they playing, Yankees?
- Yankees.

9
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,567
Imagine a 92-mile-an-hour fastball
coming at you.

10
00:01:10,568 --> 00:01:12,695
- You don't have time to think.
- Hey, guys!

11
00:01:12,696 --> 00:01:15,078
What kind of night
you think Fisk will have?

12
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:17,318
He's been hot lately.

13
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:21,923
He gets on base twice tonight,
gets on base twice, I'll paint your porch.

14
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,959
Save.

15
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,446
The sewer.

16
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,643
Hold on, I'll get it.

17
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,039
Sorry, guys, I guess I don't
know my own strength.

18
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:56,403
You know what, Dave? That must be it.

19
00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:02,966
Hey...

20
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:06,118
...you guys know what
would be really cool?

21
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:08,799
- What?
- Driving a car.

22
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,959
You know, just around the block.

23
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,838
Yeah?

24
00:02:12,839 --> 00:02:16,359
Anyone on this street
keep their keys in their car?

25
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,118
I steal a car, my dad will kill me.

26
00:02:20,119 --> 00:02:23,540
Just around the block. Who said steal?

27
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,309
Your dad kill you
for writing your name too?

28
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,977
See, now it'll be there forever.

29
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,371
Me too.

30
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,371
Forever.

31
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:11,897
Let me ask you something.

32
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:19,420
You brats think it's okay to destroy
municipal property?

33
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,472
Come here.

34
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:28,016
Get over here.

35
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,965
Well, do you?

36
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,998
- No, sir.
- No, sir.

37
00:03:44,999 --> 00:03:47,924
- No.
- No, what?

38
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,519
Sir.

39
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,742
You're the hard case of the group, huh?

40
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,269
A pack of punks, huh?

41
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,038
You live around here?

42
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:06,617
Right there.

43
00:04:10,119 --> 00:04:11,919
You?

44
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,299
Right over there.

45
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:18,268
How about you?
Where do you live, son?

46
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:23,677
- Rester Street.
- Is your mother home?

47
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,963
We're gonna go have a talk with her.
Tell her what her punk kid's been up to.

48
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,076
Get in.

49
00:04:45,599 --> 00:04:48,425
Get the fuck inside.

50
00:05:03,159 --> 00:05:05,291
In.

51
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,116
You kids go tell your mothers
what you've been up to.

52
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:22,333
And don't let me catch you shits
ruining my sidewalks again.

53
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,079
What do you mean?
Who put Dave in a car?

54
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,119
The cop. He had a gold badge.

55
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:56,199
How do you know it was a cop?
See anything on the badge?

56
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,598
- No, no writing.
- He had a uniform on?

57
00:05:58,599 --> 00:06:00,358
Like a regular police uniform?

58
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:02,599
- He was a cop.
- He took Davey.

59
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,599
- So, what were you guys doing?
- We wrote our names in the cement...

60
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,159
You were writing in cement
and playing hockey, but they took Dave?

61
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,425
- That doesn't make sense. Come on.
- Is there something wrong, Dad?

62
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,118
Please.

63
00:06:34,119 --> 00:06:36,400
No more.

64
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,228
Please.

65
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:42,627
No more, please.

66
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:12,679
- Have you seen him?
- Looks like damaged goods to me.

67
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,960
Jesus.

68
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:50,758
You took some good swings today.

69
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:53,238
Dad, I struck out.

70
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:57,318
Good swings, though.
That's what counts.

71
00:07:57,319 --> 00:08:00,638
I'll never be a good ballplayer.

72
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:05,079
Hey, you're my son. Me, Dave Boyle.

73
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:09,599
Star shortstop, Trinity High School,
1978 to '82.

74
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,772
You're gonna be a great ballplayer.

75
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,214
Hey.

76
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,635
- See that gutter drain over there?
- Yeah.

77
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,359
I used to play on this street
when I was a kid.

78
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,719
That drain swallowed every ball we had.

79
00:08:26,719 --> 00:08:30,199
Baseballs, street-hockey balls, Pinkys.

80
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,199
If we could get that manhole cover up...

81
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,239
...could be 1000 balls down there.

82
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:39,009
Really? Let's try.

83
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:07,639
Get in.

84
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,519
Come on, Dad,
come help me hunt for balls.

85
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:15,123
Maybe tomorrow. Let's get home
before Mom starts to worry.

86
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:29,758
Jimmy. Jimmy.

87
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,879
Earth to Mr. Markum.

88
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,478
- What do you want now, Pete?
- Like I'm Mr. Needy all of a sudden?

89
00:09:36,479 --> 00:09:39,398
We're out of the Marlboros
and the Winstons are looking grim.

90
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:41,359
- So?
- So that means less profit...

91
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,519
...and more profit means I get a raise.

92
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,159
So why don't you order more.

93
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,077
All right, but if the
Surgeon General calls, you're my alibi.

94
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:05,718
- Hey, you.
- Hey, there.

95
00:10:05,719 --> 00:10:08,838
I'm going out tonight
with Eve and Diane, at 7:30.

96
00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:13,443
Don't stay out too late. You got your
sister's First Communion tomorrow.

97
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,199
- Christ, I sound like...
- Someone's father?

98
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,975
Yeah, somebody's. Not mine.

99
00:10:21,599 --> 00:10:23,879
- Later, Daddy.
- Later.

100
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,912
Have fun.

101
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,946
- Later.
- Later.

102
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,609
Brendan.

103
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:05,403
- You scared the shit out of me.
- Sorry, I didn't want your dad to see me.

104
00:11:05,479 --> 00:11:10,083
He sees you sneaking
into my car, he'll shoot you.

105
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,352
What will he do if he sees this?

106
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,075
Shoot you and then kill you.

107
00:11:22,479 --> 00:11:24,398
It's been six hours.

108
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,126
I had to see you.

109
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,755
I'm gonna be late for Eve and Diane.

110
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,278
Tomorrow?

111
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,807
Like we planned?

112
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:40,146
Tomorrow.

113
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,347
Drop me around the corner.

114
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,919
- Take it easy.
- He kept cutting me off!

115
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:23,159
He kept cutting me off!
He kept cutting me off!

116
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:27,238
He followed me all the way from
Lynnfield. He was trying to kill me!

117
00:12:27,239 --> 00:12:28,718
That son of a bitch!

118
00:12:28,719 --> 00:12:32,038
Oh, can you believe this guy
keeps confessing?

119
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:36,643
I don't know. Maybe we ought to grab a
lawyer out of one of these BMWs up here.

120
00:12:38,239 --> 00:12:40,073
Hey, Devine?

121
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:47,957
- What you looking at?
- The old neighborhood.

122
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:54,319
- We're done, but I can stay.
- No, I think we're good, thanks.

123
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,923
Um, a few of us are going
to the Cantab after.

124
00:13:00,999 --> 00:13:03,799
No, I don't think so, Jen.
Thanks. Thanks anyway.

125
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,427
Yeah.

126
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:10,759
- So the wife left you six months ago?
- So?

127
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:14,079
So Jenny Coughlin there
with the body, voice and the cuffs...

128
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:17,079
This girl, she makes gay guys
rethink their orientation.

129
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,599
So, what's your point?

130
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:22,399
The girl just wants to bed you,
not wed you. You don't even blink?

131
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,879
She wants to worship
at the temple of Sean Devine.

132
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,039
- I'm married, Whitey.
- So was Bill Clinton, didn't stop him.

133
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,679
You haven't talked to Lauren
in six months.

134
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,238
She calls all the time.

135
00:13:32,239 --> 00:13:35,398
And says absolutely nothing.
Weirdest thing I ever heard of.

136
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:39,279
One of these days, the phone's gonna
ring and she'll tell me why she left.

137
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:42,879
Yeah? Maybe she's waiting
for you to say something.

138
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,136
Come on, come on, come on.

139
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:08,318
The pitch. A swing and
a line drive into right field. A base hit.

140
00:14:08,319 --> 00:14:11,559
I just don't feel like
they're gonna win this one.

141
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:22,410
Could we please have three beers?

142
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:30,794
Yeah, come on.

143
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:46,182
You believe those chicks?

144
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:51,548
- Come on.
- Oh, yeah, baby.

145
00:14:52,479 --> 00:14:54,363
Hey.

146
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,821
Ain't that Jimmy Markum's girl?

147
00:14:57,159 --> 00:15:00,119
We've got you right over here, boys.

148
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,251
Yeah.

149
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,243
I've known her since she was a kid.

150
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:18,179
A ball and two strikes. Two on, two out.

151
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,759
Dave.

152
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,718
It's 3 in the morning.

153
00:15:30,719 --> 00:15:32,207
Where have you been?

154
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,902
Oh, my God.

155
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,435
I fucked up.

156
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,504
What happened?

157
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:46,483
This guy tried to mug me,
and I swung on him and he sliced me.

158
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:50,119
But look at your hand.
We gotta go to the hospital.

159
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:53,319
No, no, it's not that bad.
It's not that deep.

160
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:57,159
- It bled like hell. I can't go to the hospital.
- Oh, my God, Dave.

161
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:01,078
Come on. Come here.

162
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:06,243
So I'm walking to my car, and this
guy comes up to me, he asks for a light.

163
00:16:06,519 --> 00:16:09,759
I say I don't smoke.
He says neither does he.

164
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:13,358
My heart starts clocking a buck fifty
because there's no one around.

165
00:16:13,359 --> 00:16:15,878
- Oh, God.
- That's when I see the knife.

166
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:19,039
Says, "Your wallet or your life.
I'm leaving with one of them."

167
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:20,678
- That's what he said?
- Yeah.

168
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:24,039
So I try to brush past him.
That's when he slices me.

169
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:28,643
- You said you swung on him first.
- Celeste, can I tell the fucking story?

170
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:31,986
I'm sorry, babe.

171
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:38,211
I went fucking nuts on him, baby. I...

172
00:16:39,879 --> 00:16:41,862
I went off.

173
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,498
I bashed his head on the parking lot.

174
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:49,142
There was blood everywhere.

175
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,249
I might have killed him.

176
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:57,018
Killed him?

177
00:17:04,159 --> 00:17:06,598
It makes you feel...

178
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:09,426
...alone, you know, hurting somebody.

179
00:17:10,159 --> 00:17:14,359
Yeah, but you had to, right?

180
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:17,037
It makes you feel...

181
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,424
...alien.

182
00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:28,628
Okay.

183
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:31,199
Babe, you hop in the shower.

184
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,464
And I'll take care of your clothes.

185
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,958
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

186
00:17:38,959 --> 00:17:41,140
Here.

187
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,558
911, police services.
What's the nature of your emergency?

188
00:17:55,559 --> 00:17:59,079
There's, like, this car
with blood in it, and the door's open.

189
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,878
- What's the location of the car?
- Sydney Street.

190
00:18:01,879 --> 00:18:05,799
It's in the Flats by Pen Park.
Me and my friend just found it.

191
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,519
- Son, what's your name?
- He wants to know her name.

192
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,159
Your name, what's your name?

193
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,282
We're so fucking out of here.
Good luck, man.

194
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,678
Dispatch, this is Unit 33.

195
00:18:26,679 --> 00:18:31,283
We're gonna need a crime-scene tech,
and you might want to notify Homicide.

196
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:35,598
Thirty-three, have you
found a body yet? Over.

197
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:40,203
No, but by the looks
of this car, we'll find one sooner or later.

198
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,518
- Yeah?
- I'm in the weeds at the store...

199
00:18:54,519 --> 00:18:55,999
...and I need some help.

200
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,799
You and Katie can't handle 6,
how you gonna handle the church crowd?

201
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:04,112
- That's the thing, Katie ain't here.
- Hold on.

202
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,039
I'll be there in 10 minutes.

203
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:17,879
Just call Sal, make sure he can
get there at 8 instead of 10.

204
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,519
No-shows at work,
what if she no-shows at church?

205
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,118
She'll be there.

206
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:24,678
You know, she's gonna
screw up this day too.

207
00:19:24,679 --> 00:19:27,919
Oh, what other day
has she screwed up lately?

208
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,498
You got two other daughters,
don't forget.

209
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:34,119
I'll be at the church before anybody else,
don't worry about that.

210
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,499
What the fuck's going on here?

211
00:19:44,439 --> 00:19:48,199
- Pete, anybody show?
- No.

212
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,279
Katie didn't call?

213
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,362
No.

214
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,239
- Hello?
- Drew, Jimmy.

215
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,768
Sorry to wake you.
I'm looking for Katie.

216
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:11,055
Yeah, she's here, I think.
Hang on a second, let me go check.

217
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,399
Have a nice day.

218
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,519
No, it was Diane Cestra
who slept over. No Katie.

219
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:22,558
Eve said she dropped her off at around
1:00. Didn't say where she was going.

220
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,358
Don't worry, I'll track her down.

221
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:28,198
- She seeing anybody maybe?
- 19-year-old girls, who can keep a tally?

222
00:20:28,199 --> 00:20:32,018
- That's the cold truth, bud.
- I'll talk to you later.

223
00:20:38,919 --> 00:20:41,159
I'll take hookers
over old ladies any day.

224
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,919
- Mind if I go grab a smoke?
- You can smoke the whole pack.

225
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,754
Thanks.

226
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,331
Can I help you, Brendan?

227
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,318
No, Mr. Markum, I'm looking
for some of that tea that my ma likes.

228
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:07,237
- That's Barry's. Next aisle.
- Thanks.

229
00:21:19,879 --> 00:21:22,478
- When's Sal getting here?
- Anytime now.

230
00:21:22,479 --> 00:21:26,001
- That it, Bren?
- A Globe.

231
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,719
I thought Katie worked on Sundays.

232
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:32,991
Are you sweet
on my man's daughter, Bren?

233
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,479
No, I just see her here sometimes.

234
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:38,319
Her little sister's making
her First Communion today.

235
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,475
Thanks. Come on, Ray.

236
00:21:54,199 --> 00:21:56,331
Can I ask you something, Jimmy?

237
00:21:56,679 --> 00:21:58,860
Shoot.

238
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,101
Why do you hate that kid so bad?

239
00:22:01,159 --> 00:22:05,759
It's not hate. Doesn't that little
mute fucker spook you out sometimes?

240
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,359
No, not Silent Ray, Brendan.

241
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:12,438
He's nice. Does sign language with his
brother even though he doesn't have to.

242
00:22:12,439 --> 00:22:14,439
He doesn't want him to feel alone.

243
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:17,638
But you look at Brendan
like you're two steps away...

244
00:22:17,639 --> 00:22:20,599
...from slicing off his nose
and feeding it to him.

245
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:24,120
- No. Really?
- Straight up.

246
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:30,199
Here's Sal. About fucking time.

247
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:46,119
- Hey, there, bad boy.
- Sarge.

248
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:50,723
This should be the city's,
but the park's state jurisdiction.

249
00:22:50,839 --> 00:22:53,666
So if the body's in there,
the case is ours.

250
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:58,118
How much evidence do you
think they've destroyed?

251
00:22:58,119 --> 00:22:59,519
Let's go find out.

252
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,999
Parker Hill vic walks into the ER
on his own...

253
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,439
...steak knife sticking out
of his collarbone.

254
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:07,718
He asks the nurse, "Hey, where they
keep the Coke machine?"

255
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:11,118
- Did she tell him?
- What do we got on the car so far?

256
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:14,798
We found the registration in the
glove box. Owner is Katherine Markum.

257
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:16,439
- Oh, shit.
- You know her?

258
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:19,078
Maybe. Might be the daughter
of a guy I know.

259
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:22,798
We found a wallet and a license
in a backpack. She's 19.

260
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:26,758
- Oh, fuck, that's her.
- Is it a problem? You close with the guy?

261
00:23:26,759 --> 00:23:31,363
When we were kids. Now it's just
a "hello" around the neighborhood.

262
00:23:32,919 --> 00:23:34,919
Nineteen.

263
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,799
Fuck, man.

264
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:39,479
He's in for a world of hurt.

265
00:24:04,999 --> 00:24:08,521
Do not make her laugh.

266
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,719
Door was ajar when we found it,
headlights on.

267
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:21,998
Blood on the driver's door, speaker,
more blood on top of the steering wheel...

268
00:24:21,999 --> 00:24:26,278
...around this bullet hole. Punched through
the driver's seatback, shoulder level.

269
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:28,399
Okay, perp stood outside the car...

270
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,399
...girl slams him with the door,
perp gets a round off...

271
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:34,439
...hits her in the shoulder,
maybe the bicep.

272
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:38,257
She runs for it
through the trampled weeds...

273
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:42,946
- What do you think?
- Yeah, I dig that.

274
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,806
Body of Christ.

275
00:24:46,279 --> 00:24:49,006
- Body of Christ.
- Amen.

276
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:53,298
My God, Jimmy, our baby.

277
00:24:56,999 --> 00:24:59,577
Body of Christ.

278
00:25:00,039 --> 00:25:04,643
Body of Christ.

279
00:25:07,719 --> 00:25:10,519
So I'm thinking she hid
out here for a little bit.

280
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,078
The killer shows, she bolts.

281
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:15,679
She goes to the other side,
she takes off running again.

282
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:19,546
Well, we better call in some divers
while we're at it.

283
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,990
Body of Christ.

284
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:32,298
Body of Christ.

285
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:44,959
So you haven't seen him
in a long time or what?

286
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:49,439
No, I haven't seen him since we
were kids. Once in a while, I run into him.

287
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,878
Sure looked cute, though, didn't he?

288
00:25:51,879 --> 00:25:55,678
- Daddy, Daddy!
- Hey, darling. Good day, huh?

289
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,318
This dress itches.

290
00:25:57,319 --> 00:26:00,999
Yeah, I'm not even wearing it,
and it's itching me.

291
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,439
We are so proud of you.

292
00:26:21,639 --> 00:26:23,879
- Morning, honey.
- Dave.

293
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:28,038
There's nothing about it in the papers.
I checked three times.

294
00:26:28,039 --> 00:26:31,808
It was late, real late.

295
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,835
- Morning, Mikey.
- Morning, Dad.

296
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:40,723
- You up for hitting some Wiffle Balls?
- Yeah, come on, let's go.

297
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,510
Come on.

298
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:48,039
Put your coat on, Mike.

299
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,278
Thanks, Mom.

300
00:27:00,999 --> 00:27:03,359
- Hey, Jimmy.
- What's up, Ed?

301
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,119
They got Sydney blocked off,
Crescent to Dunboy.

302
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:10,318
Boo Bear Durkin saw frogmen going
into the Pen. Why you all decked out?

303
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:13,158
- Nadine's First Communion.
- What are you doing here?

304
00:27:13,159 --> 00:27:16,185
Just curious, I guess.

305
00:27:26,479 --> 00:27:31,083
That's my daughter's car.

306
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,958
The dog's sniffing
something by the old bear cage.

307
00:27:38,959 --> 00:27:40,799
- Want to take a walk over?
- Yeah.

308
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,039
- Trooper Devine?
- Yeah, go ahead.

309
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,439
We got a guy on Sydney
says he's the father.

310
00:27:45,439 --> 00:27:46,999
Oh, shit.

311
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,599
- Got a psychologist on the scene yet?
- En route.

312
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,518
Just keep him calm
till the shrink gets here.

313
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:56,039
Asking for you. Says he knows you.
Not taking no for an answer.

314
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,878
And he's got some guys with him.

315
00:27:57,879 --> 00:28:01,198
- What guys?
- Crazy-looking guys.

316
00:28:01,199 --> 00:28:05,678
- The Savage brothers.
- Just a "hi" around the neighborhood?

317
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:07,861
All right, I'm on my way.

318
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,798
- Hey, guys.
- That's our niece in there.

319
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:15,558
- Let us in.
- We're doing our job.

320
00:28:15,559 --> 00:28:16,958
- Let us in.
- Fuck you!

321
00:28:16,959 --> 00:28:18,758
The doughnut shop's that way!

322
00:28:18,759 --> 00:28:21,598
- Nick, Val, ease up.
- Fucking dickhead.

323
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:23,719
- Enough.
- Nick.

324
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:27,999
Go to Drew Pigeon's house, talk to his
daughter. Katie was with them last night.

325
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,925
- Kevin, let's go.
- And, guys?

326
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:34,159
These girls are friends,
so don't be hard on them.

327
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,688
- But get answers.
- You got it.

328
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:43,978
Yeah, that's what I believe. Yeah.

329
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:47,439
Hey, Jimmy. Hey, man.

330
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,118
- Is she in there?
- All we're doing is looking.

331
00:28:50,119 --> 00:28:53,799
- Quit blowing sunshine up his ass.
- That's my daughter's car.

332
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,878
- I understand.
- And it's got blood in it.

333
00:28:56,879 --> 00:29:01,159
You got fucking dogs all over. Why do you
got dogs looking for my daughter, Sean?

334
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:05,763
Because we're looking, Jimmy, okay?
Right now all she is is missing, okay?

335
00:29:05,799 --> 00:29:08,118
- Trooper Devine?
- Yeah, say again.

336
00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:11,118
Sergeant Powers says you need
to get in here ASAP.

337
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:14,919
- Your location?
- The old bear cage. It's a fucking mess.

338
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,839
All right.

339
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:19,219
Make sure he doesn't get through.

340
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,439
You got those bolt cutters in your car?

341
00:29:21,439 --> 00:29:25,398
I'll get us right through
that Sydney Street fence.

342
00:29:25,399 --> 00:29:27,531
Go.

343
00:29:30,759 --> 00:29:34,879
There's a massive search underway
for a woman missing in Buckingham Flats.

344
00:29:34,879 --> 00:29:37,559
All we know now
is there are signs of foul play...

345
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:40,758
...in a car found abandoned
outside of Pen Park.

346
00:29:40,759 --> 00:29:44,838
Now, police officers have moved in
quickly and cordoned off the area...

347
00:29:44,839 --> 00:29:48,199
...but even as we speak,
a crowd of spectators has gathered.

348
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:51,558
We don't know more than that,
but we will stay on the story.

349
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:56,163
Until later, this is Jim Smith
reporting for WB 56, 10:00 news.

350
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,966
Ready? Bat back.

351
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,569
All the way back.

352
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:17,758
I never saw anything like that before.

353
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:20,188
What do we got?

354
00:30:28,879 --> 00:30:31,407
Oh, Christ.

355
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,442
Is that her?

356
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,406
Yeah.

357
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,359
We'll have the father
do a positive ID at the morgue.

358
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:01,839
Blood's from a split
in the crown of her head.

359
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,759
She was beaten with a stick,
but that didn't kill her.

360
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:09,363
She was shot a second time.
Looks like a .38.

361
00:31:10,279 --> 00:31:12,679
What the fuck am I gonna tell him?

362
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,798
"Hey, Jimmy...

363
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:19,402
...God said you owed another marker.
He came to collect."

364
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:23,718
- Hey.
- Hold on!

365
00:31:23,719 --> 00:31:27,998
- Grab him. Stop that guy.
- Hey, you!

366
00:31:27,999 --> 00:31:30,318
- I'm fucking going in there!
- Take it easy!

367
00:31:30,319 --> 00:31:32,719
- Get his arms.
- Hold him. Come on.

368
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,999
- Let me in, you motherfuckers!
- Take it easy.

369
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,999
- Let me in!
- Is she in there?!

370
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,603
- Sean, is my daughter in there?!
- Let me in! You motherfuckers!

371
00:31:44,839 --> 00:31:48,359
Is my daughter in there?!
Is she in there?! Is she in there?!

372
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,638
Hey, take it easy! That's the father.

373
00:31:50,639 --> 00:31:54,119
Is my daughter in there?! Motherfuckers!

374
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:57,159
Is that my daughter in there?!

375
00:31:57,160 --> 00:32:00,358
Look into my eyes! Is she in there?!

376
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:04,878
- Get off me!
- Sean, is that my daughter in there?!

377
00:32:04,879 --> 00:32:08,202
Is that my daughter in there?

378
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:11,198
No! No!

379
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,199
Oh, no!

380
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,758
No, God!

381
00:32:18,759 --> 00:32:22,826
Oh, God, no!

382
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,758
No one's said anything, right?

383
00:33:06,759 --> 00:33:08,518
What do you mean?

384
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:13,038
You haven't seen her yet, right?
It might not be her, right?

385
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:15,078
Jimmy?

386
00:33:15,079 --> 00:33:16,799
- Jimmy, please...
- Please what?

387
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:21,118
- Please...
- Please what, baby? Please what?

388
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,824
Yeah, that's her.

389
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:05,089
That's Katie.

390
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,606
That's my daughter.

391
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,438
Fresh-brewed.

392
00:34:29,439 --> 00:34:31,959
So we need to work a time line.

393
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:34,358
It's details, little things
that make a case.

394
00:34:34,359 --> 00:34:38,823
You know, things that you could
forget about after a day or two.

395
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:43,799
Did you ever think about how one little
choice could change a whole life?

396
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,759
I heard Hitler's mother
wanted to abort him.

397
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:50,428
At the last minute,
she changed her mind.

398
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:53,371
See what I mean?

399
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:56,058
What do you mean, Jimmy?

400
00:34:57,439 --> 00:35:01,159
What if you or I had gotten
into that car instead of Dave Boyle?

401
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,119
- What car?
- You're losing me here.

402
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:05,846
If I'd gotten into that car that day...

403
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,638
...my life would have been
a different thing.

404
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:12,799
My first wife, Marita, Katie's mother...

405
00:35:12,799 --> 00:35:15,518
...she was a beautiful woman.

406
00:35:15,519 --> 00:35:17,800
Regal.

407
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,799
As a lot of Latin women are,
and she knew it.

408
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,359
You had to have balls
to go near her, and I did.

409
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:27,963
Eighteen years old, the two of us.
She was carrying Katie.

410
00:35:28,399 --> 00:35:30,318
Now, here's the thing, Sean.

411
00:35:30,319 --> 00:35:33,159
If I'd gotten into that car,
I'd be a basket case.

412
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:36,238
I never would have had the juice
to go near her.

413
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:39,439
And Katie never would have been born.

414
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,158
And she never would have
been murdered. You know?

415
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,928
- See?
- Yeah.

416
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:52,003
- You ever see Dave around?
- He married my cousin Celeste.

417
00:35:55,279 --> 00:35:59,159
What time did Katie get home
from work yesterday?

418
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,758
Around 7:30.

419
00:36:00,759 --> 00:36:04,281
Anything unusual,
out of the way about her?

420
00:36:04,359 --> 00:36:08,963
No. She sat with us,
with me and the girls, while we ate.

421
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:13,900
She was having dinner with her friends.

422
00:36:16,399 --> 00:36:19,558
- Eve Pigeon and Diane Cestra?
- Yeah.

423
00:36:19,559 --> 00:36:23,398
She talked to Nadine
about her Communion...

424
00:36:23,399 --> 00:36:26,919
...and then she was on the phone
in her room for a bit.

425
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:29,359
And then around 8, she left.

426
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:32,519
- Do you know who she talked to?
- No.

427
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:36,278
Do you mind if we have the phone
company subpoenaed for records?

428
00:36:36,279 --> 00:36:38,598
- No, go ahead.
- Good.

429
00:36:38,599 --> 00:36:43,203
You spent most of the day Saturday
with your daughter in the store, correct?

430
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:46,079
Yes and no. I was mostly in back.

431
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:49,158
Anything odd? A confrontation
with a customer, anything?

432
00:36:49,159 --> 00:36:52,439
No, she was herself,
she was happy. She...

433
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,571
She what?

434
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,558
It's nothing.

435
00:36:57,559 --> 00:37:01,230
Listen, the littlest thing
could be something right now.

436
00:37:01,279 --> 00:37:04,759
It's just that when she was little,
right after her mother died...

437
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:08,439
...I had just gotten out of prison,
she couldn't be by herself.

438
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:11,719
Whether she was crying or not,
it didn't matter...

439
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:15,918
...but she gave a look sometimes, like
she was preparing to never see you again.

440
00:37:15,919 --> 00:37:19,878
For a couple of seconds on Saturday,
she looked at me that way.

441
00:37:19,879 --> 00:37:22,959
- Okay.
- It was just a look.

442
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:27,563
It's information. We collect it, put it
together, see what fits. Little things.

443
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,159
You were in prison?

444
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,559
- Oh, Jesus.
- Here we go.

445
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:33,318
- Whitey.
- I'm just asking.

446
00:37:33,319 --> 00:37:37,158
Sixteen years ago, I did a two-year bit
for robbery at Deer Island.

447
00:37:37,159 --> 00:37:40,439
Is that gonna find
my daughter's killer? Just asking.

448
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:44,279
Let's forget about that.
Let's get back to the point.

449
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:47,198
- Sorry.
- It's all right. It's all right.

450
00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:49,559
Okay, Mr. Markum.

451
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:53,726
- Okay.
- Okay. All right. So, Jimmy...

452
00:37:54,039 --> 00:37:58,155
...outside of the look Katie gave you,
was there anything else?

453
00:38:04,359 --> 00:38:06,559
There was this kid.

454
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:09,039
What am I talking about?
That was this morning.

455
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,568
What? Remember, it's the little things.

456
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:15,639
This kid Brendan Harris come in the store,
like he was expecting to see her.

457
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:18,478
- Barely knew each other.
- Could they have been dating?

458
00:38:18,479 --> 00:38:20,358
- No.
- What makes you so sure?

459
00:38:20,359 --> 00:38:22,958
Sean, are you gonna grill me?
A father knows.

460
00:38:22,959 --> 00:38:25,998
Mrs. Markum, was Katie seeing anyone?

461
00:38:25,999 --> 00:38:29,119
No one right now, as far as we know.

462
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:32,239
- I mean, knew.
- I'll give you whatever you need tomorrow.

463
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:35,559
We got girls at home wanting to know
where their sister is.

464
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:40,163
All right, there will be a trooper
downstairs to take you home.

465
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,479
And if you think of anything...

466
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:48,844
...anything at all, give us a call.

467
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:56,119
He said you almost got into a car
when you were kids?

468
00:38:56,120 --> 00:39:00,038
Shit. Me, Jimmy and a kid named Boyle
were playing in front of my house.

469
00:39:00,039 --> 00:39:01,999
This car came up and took Dave away.

470
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,879
- Abduction?
- Yeah, guys pretending to be cops.

471
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:09,119
Convinced Dave to get in the car,
kept him for four days before he escaped.

472
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:11,039
- They catch these guys?
- One died.

473
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,959
The other got busted,
went the noose route in his cell.

474
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:17,958
Your pal Markum, the moment I laid
eyes on him, I could tell he'd done time.

475
00:39:17,959 --> 00:39:21,158
They never lose that tension,
it settles in their shoulders.

476
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:23,959
He lost his daughter.
That's what's in his shoulders.

477
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:28,563
No, that's in his stomach.
The tension in his shoulders, that's prison.

478
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:35,918
The gunshot wound
to the back of the head...

479
00:39:35,919 --> 00:39:37,959
...not the trauma from the beating.

480
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,518
What else?

481
00:39:39,519 --> 00:39:42,118
Her and her friends were barhopping.

482
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:45,199
We're interviewing anyone
who might have seen them.

483
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,878
One other thing,
the backpack in her car...

484
00:39:47,879 --> 00:39:50,918
...had pamphlets on Las Vegas
and a list of Vegas hotels.

485
00:39:50,919 --> 00:39:53,279
It doesn't sound like much.

486
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,906
What do you say, Devine?

487
00:39:57,039 --> 00:39:59,072
We'll get the guy, sir.

488
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:03,683
That's right. All right, let's do it.

489
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:10,628
- That's the best you can come up with?
- It made him happy, didn't it?

490
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,649
This is Sean.

491
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:19,976
- Hello?
- Is it Lauren?

492
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:25,211
You're in Manhattan.
I can tell by the traffic sounds.

493
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,952
Is he with you?

494
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,418
Is that the baby?

495
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,808
Christ, Lauren, at least tell me her name.

496
00:40:49,759 --> 00:40:52,639
Yeah, nice talking to you too.

497
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,613
Hey.

498
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:12,959
Would it surprise you?

499
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,239
Wouldn't be the first time.

500
00:41:17,959 --> 00:41:20,838
Did you see that girl?
Did you see that...?

501
00:41:20,839 --> 00:41:23,198
Did you see her?

502
00:41:23,199 --> 00:41:26,279
- I heard a car hit something.
- Hit what? Another car?

503
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:29,198
- Oh, no, not loud like that.
- Like hitting the curb?

504
00:41:29,199 --> 00:41:31,158
Yes, maybe.

505
00:41:31,159 --> 00:41:34,158
Then it stalled, and someone said, "Hi".

506
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:36,687
- Someone said, "Hi"?
- "Hi".

507
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:39,879
Then there was a loud crack.

508
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:43,598
- Could it have been a gunshot?
- Yes, maybe.

509
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:46,999
- Did you look out your window?
- Oh, no.

510
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,520
I was in my dressing gown by then.

511
00:41:50,599 --> 00:41:53,478
I don't look out the window
in my dressing gown.

512
00:41:53,479 --> 00:41:56,518
The voice you heard,
was that a male or a female?

513
00:41:56,519 --> 00:41:58,718
Female.

514
00:41:58,719 --> 00:42:00,355
I think.

515
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:03,959
- It sounds like the girl knew the shooter.
- Yeah.

516
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:06,636
Sorry to trouble you.

517
00:42:13,799 --> 00:42:16,319
- Jimmy.
- Theo.

518
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,718
How's my daughter?
How's Annabeth holding up?

519
00:42:18,719 --> 00:42:20,798
- She's trying.
- Let's get these on ice.

520
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:23,626
You got a couple of coolers?

521
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,426
Right here's fine.

522
00:42:35,879 --> 00:42:39,278
So how are you handling all this so far?

523
00:42:39,279 --> 00:42:42,279
- It hasn't really sunk in, Theo.
- Yeah?

524
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:44,759
It's gonna hurt like hell when it does.

525
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:48,518
When my Janey died,
I was no good for six months...

526
00:42:48,519 --> 00:42:52,318
...but my kids were
all grown up. I had that luxury.

527
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:56,733
You, you got domestic responsibilities.

528
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,878
Domestic responsibilities?

529
00:42:59,879 --> 00:43:04,483
Yeah, you gotta take care of my daughter
and those girls. That's your first priority.

530
00:43:05,519 --> 00:43:08,159
Oh, you figured that might
have slipped my mind?

531
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:11,233
It just needed to be said, that's all.

532
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:14,879
You'll come through
because you're a man.

533
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,119
Like I said to Annabeth,
your wedding day.

534
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:20,399
I said, "You got yourself
a real old-school man there."

535
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,078
- Like they put her in a bag.
- What?

536
00:43:23,079 --> 00:43:26,318
That's what Katie looked like
when I saw her in the morgue.

537
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:30,922
Like they put her in a bag
and then they beat the bag with pipes.

538
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,959
- Well...
- Janey died in her sleep, all due respect.

539
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:37,318
She went to sleep,
she never woke up. Peaceful.

540
00:43:37,319 --> 00:43:41,923
- You don't need to talk about Janey.
- My daughter was murdered.

541
00:43:41,999 --> 00:43:45,678
They put a gun to her. As we
stand here, she's on an autopsy slab...

542
00:43:45,679 --> 00:43:48,519
...getting cut open by scalpels
and chest spreaders...

543
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:52,884
...and you're talking to me
about domestic fucking responsibility?

544
00:43:55,719 --> 00:43:58,347
Good to see you, Theo.

545
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:05,318
Eve, just tell them what they
want to know.

546
00:44:05,319 --> 00:44:08,318
- Who was she dating?
- We already told the Savages.

547
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:11,119
- The Savage brothers?
- They were here yesterday.

548
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:14,519
Good, now try us out.
Who was she dating?

549
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:17,246
No one special.

550
00:44:19,959 --> 00:44:23,798
You guys were having
a goodbye dinner, right?

551
00:44:23,799 --> 00:44:26,239
- What?
- She was leaving town, wasn't she?

552
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:29,639
- Going to Las Vegas?
- How do you know?

553
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:34,243
She closed her bank account,
she had hotel phone numbers.

554
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:38,598
She wanted out of this dump.
She wanted to start a new life.

555
00:44:38,599 --> 00:44:42,478
Well, a 19-year-old girl
doesn't go to Las Vegas alone.

556
00:44:42,479 --> 00:44:44,879
So who was she going with?

557
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:49,483
Come on, girls.
Who was she going with?

558
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:51,176
Brendan.

559
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,318
Excuse me?

560
00:44:53,319 --> 00:44:56,998
- Brendan.
- Brendan Harris?

561
00:44:56,999 --> 00:44:59,279
Brendan Harris, yeah.

562
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,411
You got an address?

563
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:16,289
Hey, Dave.

564
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:21,558
Hey, Jimmy.

565
00:45:21,559 --> 00:45:25,676
Sorry, I came out for a smoke.

566
00:45:25,679 --> 00:45:29,100
Go ahead, sit down. Sit down.

567
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:37,369
I haven't had a chance
to talk to you all day.

568
00:45:37,479 --> 00:45:42,083
How you doing?

569
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:45,350
What happened to your hand?

570
00:45:45,799 --> 00:45:47,683
This?

571
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:52,843
I was helping a buddy move a couch.
I slammed it in the doorjamb.

572
00:45:53,479 --> 00:45:56,654
Ways you can manage
to hurt yourself, right?

573
00:45:58,279 --> 00:46:00,262
It's good to see you.

574
00:46:00,639 --> 00:46:02,226
Yeah?

575
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:09,958
How are our girls holding up?

576
00:46:09,959 --> 00:46:12,158
They're doing okay, I guess.

577
00:46:12,159 --> 00:46:16,127
That Celeste, she's a godsend.
You thank her for me, will you?

578
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:31,243
It's nice, isn't it? Just to sit out here.

579
00:46:32,599 --> 00:46:34,136
Yeah.

580
00:46:38,599 --> 00:46:42,598
I couldn't stand looking through the
fridge to find room for all that food...

581
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:45,719
...we're gonna throw away
in the next few days.

582
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:49,537
- Lot of waste, huh?
- Yeah.

583
00:46:50,119 --> 00:46:54,723
I just can't let anything get fucked up
in these next few days.

584
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:59,363
Because it's all anybody
will remember about her.

585
00:47:05,079 --> 00:47:09,146
One thing you could say about Katie,
even when she was little...

586
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,998
...that girl was neat.

587
00:47:14,719 --> 00:47:16,603
When I got out of the joint...

588
00:47:17,559 --> 00:47:21,031
...you know, after Marita died...

589
00:47:21,799 --> 00:47:26,403
...I remember, I was more afraid
of my little daughter...

590
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:30,894
...than I ever was of being in prison.

591
00:47:38,399 --> 00:47:41,027
I loved her...

592
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:44,039
...most...

593
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:50,324
...because when we were sitting in that
kitchen that night...

594
00:47:52,279 --> 00:47:56,883
...it was like we were the last two
people on Earth. You know, forgotten.

595
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:01,328
Unwanted.

596
00:48:02,839 --> 00:48:07,198
And it's really starting to piss me off,
Dave, because I can't cry for her.

597
00:48:07,199 --> 00:48:11,803
My own little daughter,
and I can't even cry for her.

598
00:48:15,879 --> 00:48:18,011
Jimmy.

599
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:23,791
You're crying now.

600
00:48:26,439 --> 00:48:29,017
Yeah, damn.

601
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:36,880
I just want to hug her one more time.

602
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:44,173
She was 19 fucking years old.

603
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:52,649
Do you want me to leave you alone?

604
00:48:53,159 --> 00:48:56,183
No, just stay here for a minute,
if that's cool.

605
00:48:56,719 --> 00:49:01,034
Yeah, sure. Jimmy, it's cool.

606
00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:19,319
When was the last time
you saw Katie Markum?

607
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:23,434
- You don't think I'd hurt her do you?
- She isn't hurt. She's dead.

608
00:49:25,799 --> 00:49:30,164
- I didn't kill her.
- Again, when's the last time you saw her?

609
00:49:31,439 --> 00:49:34,879
About 8...
Saturday night, about 8:00.

610
00:49:34,879 --> 00:49:37,259
About like 8, Brendan, or at 8?

611
00:49:37,479 --> 00:49:39,660
It was about 8. Um...

612
00:49:40,199 --> 00:49:44,803
We had a couple slices at Hi-Fi,
and she had to go meet Eve and Diane.

613
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:49,287
Yeah. Why doesn't Jimmy Markum
like you?

614
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,982
I don't know.

615
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:57,083
But he told Katie he never wanted her
to see me or any other Harris.

616
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:01,079
What? That thief thinks he's better
than our family?

617
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:02,678
He's not a thief.

618
00:50:02,679 --> 00:50:05,759
He's a thief! A scumbag burglar.

619
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:10,078
Daughter probably had the same bad
gene. You count yourself lucky, Bren.

620
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:14,683
So Katie had some brochures for Vegas.
We heard she was going there with you.

621
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:19,014
We were gonna leave Sunday.

622
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:23,071
We were gonna get married
when we got there.

623
00:50:24,519 --> 00:50:27,078
Well, that was the plan, right?

624
00:50:27,079 --> 00:50:29,998
You were gonna leave me?
Without a word?

625
00:50:29,999 --> 00:50:33,718
- Ma, I was gonna tell you.
- Just like your father, huh?

626
00:50:39,719 --> 00:50:43,879
That's my brother, Ray,
and his friend John.

627
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:46,399
- Hey, boys.
- Hey.

628
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,198
He don't speak.

629
00:50:48,199 --> 00:50:52,519
Father couldn't shut up, but his son's
a mute. Oh, yeah, life's fucking fair.

630
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:57,123
They're here about Katie. Why don't you
go watch TV or something.

631
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:02,323
So where were you between 12:30
and 2 a.m. on Sunday morning, Brendan?

632
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:03,919
I was asleep.

633
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:06,051
Can you confirm that, Mrs. Harris?

634
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:12,478
I can confirm that he closed his door
at 10:00.

635
00:51:12,479 --> 00:51:15,802
He came down for breakfast at 9.

636
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:20,558
I can't confirm that he didn't open
his window and go down the fire escape.

637
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:25,162
Okay, we're gonna ask you to take a
polygraph. You think you're up for that?

638
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:30,144
I loved her so much.

639
00:51:31,559 --> 00:51:34,782
I'm never gonna feel that again.

640
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:37,498
It doesn't happen twice.

641
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:41,786
Doesn't happen once most times.

642
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:44,941
Celeste.

643
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:49,798
- Sorry, Jimmy. You surprised me.
- What are you still doing here?

644
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:54,132
I don't know.

645
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:58,089
I don't know, I just...

646
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:00,638
Did Annabeth get to sleep?

647
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:03,238
Yeah, I convinced her to take a pill.

648
00:52:03,239 --> 00:52:06,809
- Could I get one of those?
- Yeah.

649
00:52:11,079 --> 00:52:14,005
One for the road and then home.

650
00:52:17,639 --> 00:52:22,243
Jimmy, I can stay over if you want.
Sit up with Annabeth.

651
00:52:22,279 --> 00:52:24,461
You've done enough.

652
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:30,768
To you and Dave for being here for this.

653
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:50,727
Okay, Jimmy. I'll be back.

654
00:52:51,239 --> 00:52:54,199
I'll be by first thing tomorrow.
See you first thing.

655
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:56,182
Good night.

656
00:52:56,719 --> 00:52:59,843
- Good night.
- Yeah, good night.

657
00:53:18,119 --> 00:53:19,804
Hello?

658
00:53:21,959 --> 00:53:26,563
Oh, Christ. Lauren, say something.

659
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:35,241
"Okay. Hey, Sean, how was your day?"

660
00:53:35,279 --> 00:53:39,039
Oh, me? I'm tired of wishing
things made sense.

661
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:41,359
I'm tired of caring about
some dead girl...

662
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:44,632
...and there's just gonna be
another one after her.

663
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:49,559
Sending killers to jail is sending them
where they've been heading all their lives.

664
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,989
The dead are still dead.

665
00:53:54,039 --> 00:53:56,439
Jesus, I...

666
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:58,759
...can't do this tonight.

667
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:00,891
I just...

668
00:54:01,479 --> 00:54:03,559
I can't do it.

669
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:05,691
Bye, baby.

670
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:17,452
Because...

671
00:54:18,159 --> 00:54:21,719
...sometimes the man
wasn't a man at all.

672
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:23,752
He was the boy.

673
00:54:24,239 --> 00:54:27,860
The boy who escaped from wolves.

674
00:54:28,199 --> 00:54:30,958
An animal of the dusk.

675
00:54:30,959 --> 00:54:33,158
Invisible.

676
00:54:33,159 --> 00:54:35,390
Silent.

677
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,678
Living in a world...

678
00:54:37,679 --> 00:54:40,555
...the others never saw.

679
00:54:41,799 --> 00:54:44,774
World of fireflies.

680
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:50,323
Unseen except as a flare
in the corner of your eye.

681
00:54:50,679 --> 00:54:55,283
Vanished by the time
you turn your head toward it.

682
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:10,603
I just gotta get my head right.

683
00:55:13,479 --> 00:55:16,998
Catch a nice, long sleep.

684
00:55:16,999 --> 00:55:20,569
And the boy will go back to his forest.

685
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:25,548
Back to his fireflies.

686
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:33,814
Is he asleep?

687
00:55:54,199 --> 00:55:57,075
How's Jimmy and everybody?

688
00:55:57,560 --> 00:55:59,479
Okay.

689
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:01,561
It's weird.

690
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:05,519
Took something like this for me and him
to become friends again.

691
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:08,444
Dave? Dave.

692
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,329
There's still nothing in the paper.

693
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:18,083
About what?

694
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:24,358
I don't know, honey. Maybe I didn't
hurt him as bad as I thought.

695
00:56:24,359 --> 00:56:27,483
He's a mugger. He's not going
to the hospital.

696
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:31,559
Yeah.

697
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:33,393
Right.

698
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:38,354
Anyhow, it doesn't matter, does it?

699
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:41,593
I mean, Katie Markum is dead.

700
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:45,342
That seems more important right now.

701
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:17,242
I know in my soul I contributed
to your death.

702
00:57:17,319 --> 00:57:20,294
But I don't know how.

703
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:40,679
Brendan Harris aced his polygraph.

704
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:43,399
Good. I didn't like him for it,
nor want him for it.

705
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:44,838
Yeah. Poor fucking kid.

706
00:57:44,839 --> 00:57:48,838
Ballistics will be back in a while.
Meantime, we got a list of bar patrons.

707
00:57:48,839 --> 00:57:51,558
All people who, I'm certain,
are dying to cooperate.

708
00:57:51,559 --> 00:57:54,438
Considering the crime, maybe.

709
00:57:54,439 --> 00:57:55,879
Dave Boyle?

710
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:59,639
Hey, is that the guy you were friends
with as a kid? The car guy?

711
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:00,999
Could be.

712
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:04,519
He's a guy to talk to. He knows you.
He won't treat us like cops.

713
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:08,933
- Clam up for no reason, huh?
- We'll see.

714
00:58:18,879 --> 00:58:20,813
Hey, Boyle!

715
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:23,599
- What's it been, seven, eight years?
- Yeah.

716
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:25,318
Yeah. How you doing?

717
00:58:25,319 --> 00:58:26,759
This is my son, Michael.

718
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:29,199
Hey, Michael. How you doing?
My name's Sean.

719
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:30,638
I'm an old buddy of your dad's.

720
00:58:30,639 --> 00:58:32,275
- Hi.
- Hi.

721
00:58:32,599 --> 00:58:35,878
- So you still with the staties?
- Homicide. This is my partner.

722
00:58:35,879 --> 00:58:38,638
- Sergeant Powers. How are you?
- So you got a minute?

723
00:58:38,639 --> 00:58:42,919
- We'd love to ask some quick questions.
- I was gonna walk Michael to school.

724
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:46,838
- I can be back in a few minutes.
- We'll walk with you, okay?

725
00:58:46,839 --> 00:58:48,624
Sure.

726
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:51,931
So you look good.

727
00:58:52,039 --> 00:58:55,078
- I hear rents are rising.
- Yeah, the yuppies are coming.

728
00:58:55,079 --> 00:58:57,759
They're cutting my dad's
old house up into condos.

729
00:58:57,760 --> 00:58:59,639
We walked by there the other day.

730
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:01,958
Must be something we could do
to stop them.

731
00:59:01,959 --> 00:59:04,439
A friend of mine says the other day,
he says:

732
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:06,639
"Neighborhood needs
a fucking crime wave.

733
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:08,879
Get property values where they belong."

734
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:13,359
Girls keep getting murdered up in
Pen Park you might get your wish.

735
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:15,918
Dave. Call me Dave.

736
00:59:15,919 --> 00:59:18,159
You said the F-word, Dad.

737
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:20,998
Yeah, I know.
Walk on up ahead, Michael.

738
00:59:20,999 --> 00:59:24,199
Us guys need to talk. Go on.

739
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:28,199
- So, what's up, Sean?
- Yeah, you heard about Katie Markum?

740
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:31,158
Yeah, I was at Jimmy's yesterday.
Celeste is there now.

741
00:59:31,159 --> 00:59:33,358
- Who's Celeste?
- My wife.

742
00:59:33,359 --> 00:59:37,598
- How's Jimmy doing?
- It's hard to tell. You know him.

743
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:41,599
- Yeah, so the reason we came by...
- Listen, I saw her.

744
00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:45,999
Katie. I don't know if you know that.
At McGill's, the night she died.

745
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,079
That's what we wanted to talk about.

746
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:52,039
They were at a couple of bars that night.
Your name turned up for McGill's.

747
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:54,399
They put on quite a show
dancing on the bar.

748
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:57,959
- Pretty drunk, huh?
- But it was harmless.

749
00:59:57,960 --> 01:00:01,038
They weren't stripping or nothing.
They were just 19.

750
01:00:01,039 --> 01:00:02,719
What time did they leave?

751
01:00:02,719 --> 01:00:05,799
I left at 1. They must've left
15 minutes before me.

752
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:09,518
- So we'll say 12:45?
- Sounds about right.

753
01:00:09,799 --> 01:00:12,479
You see anything unusual
or anyone...?

754
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:14,462
Michael.

755
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:16,359
Like what?
I don't know.

756
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:17,798
A guy watching the girls?

757
01:00:17,799 --> 01:00:21,170
A guy with hate in his eyes?
A woman-hater?

758
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:26,403
No, if they hadn't danced on the bar,
it would've been business as usual.

759
01:00:26,439 --> 01:00:27,918
See you later, Dad.

760
01:00:27,919 --> 01:00:30,051
- You got your milk money?
- Uh-huh.

761
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:38,739
Fuck, I hated school.

762
01:00:38,759 --> 01:00:40,439
What?

763
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:41,599
Oh, uh...

764
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:44,759
Yeah, me too, Sean.

765
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:49,363
Uh, just one more thing, Mr. Boyle.
Where did you go after you left McGill's?

766
01:00:50,159 --> 01:00:53,318
- Home.
- 15, would you say?

767
01:00:53,319 --> 01:00:56,643
- Roughly. Sure.
- All right.

768
01:00:57,640 --> 01:01:00,998
Yeah, well, thanks a lot, Dave.
We'll grab a beer sometime?

769
01:01:00,999 --> 01:01:04,768
- Yeah, I'd like that, Sean.
- All right.

770
01:01:10,439 --> 01:01:12,319
What?

771
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:15,145
What happened to him in that car?

772
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:23,559
Can you believe this?

773
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:26,598
Man, it's the same as Dunkin' Donuts.
It costs 15 times the price.

774
01:01:26,599 --> 01:01:28,731
Yeah, well...

775
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:32,398
You know, you take away love,
money or hate as motives...

776
01:01:32,399 --> 01:01:34,399
...you're not left with a whole lot.

777
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:37,038
Well, if this Markum thing's random,
I mean, shit.

778
01:01:37,039 --> 01:01:41,239
Yeah, tell me about it. But the old lady,
Prior, she doesn't hear a scream.

779
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:43,279
Hears a gunshot,
before that a "hi"...

780
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:46,559
...which tells me the girl is either
friendly or she knew him.

781
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:51,158
She turns to the curb, not too fast or she
hops it. Foot's off the clutch. She stalls.

782
01:01:51,159 --> 01:01:55,039
- She says, "Hi". He shoots her.
- She slams the door into him, takes off.

783
01:01:55,039 --> 01:01:57,758
What makes her swerve
without hitting the brakes?

784
01:01:57,759 --> 01:02:00,439
- I don't know. Something in the street.
- Maybe.

785
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:03,719
This Markum girl couldn't have
weighed more than what, 110?

786
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:07,999
- Hits hard enough to get a jump on him?
- Maybe he's knocked back on his heels.

787
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:11,559
Your pal Dave strikes me as a guy
permanently back on his heels.

788
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:14,799
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a second, how
did we get to Dave Boyle all of a sudden?

789
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:17,559
- We just got to him.
- He's a guy who was in the bar.

790
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:20,439
The last place, Seany,
the last place she was at.

791
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:22,639
The guy is wrong. You saw his hand.

792
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:26,319
Yeah, I saw his hand. You seriously
want to take a look at Dave Boyle?

793
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:28,897
Just a little one.

794
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:37,439
I'd recommend two sets of
visiting hours, from 3 to 5, and 7 to 9.

795
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:40,018
- Sure.
- Good.

796
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:45,603
- Have you thought about flowers?
- I'll call Knopfler's this afternoon.

797
01:02:45,919 --> 01:02:47,506
Good.

798
01:02:52,359 --> 01:02:54,640
And the notice?

799
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,635
Notice?

800
01:02:57,640 --> 01:03:02,243
Yes, the obituary. We can take care of it
if you give us her basic information.

801
01:03:02,479 --> 01:03:05,119
Or if you prefer donations
in lieu of flowers?

802
01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:07,152
Where's my daughter?

803
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:11,588
Downstairs, in the basement.

804
01:03:11,919 --> 01:03:13,455
I wanna see her.

805
01:03:58,599 --> 01:04:01,376
I'm gonna find him, Katie.

806
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:05,519
I'm gonna find him before the police do.

807
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:08,643
I'm gonna find the man,
and I'm gonna kill him.

808
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:14,873
Did you say something, Mr. Markum?

809
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:19,880
The notice.

810
01:04:20,679 --> 01:04:23,505
"Katherine Markum..."

811
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:28,639
...beloved daughter
of James and Marita, deceased...

812
01:04:28,639 --> 01:04:33,039
"...stepdaughter of Annabeth, sister to..."

813
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:37,156
"Sister to Sara and Nadine."

814
01:05:15,079 --> 01:05:19,683
- You guys again?
- Yeah. We're like two bad pennies.

815
01:05:19,879 --> 01:05:22,238
- You dropping in on Jimmy?
- Yeah.

816
01:05:22,239 --> 01:05:25,039
Do you have some kind of, what,
break in the case?

817
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:28,079
No, just paying our respects.
Where you off to?

818
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:30,799
Annabeth got a craving for cigarettes.

819
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:32,678
I'm gonna go get some.
See you in a minute.

820
01:05:32,679 --> 01:05:36,959
By the way, Mr. Boyle, what happened
to your hand there?

821
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:41,563
Uh, garbage disposal. It jammed,
I stuck my hand in, it started again.

822
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:44,752
- Stupid.
- Yeah, painful.

823
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:50,918
Garbage disposal. Bullshit.

824
01:05:50,919 --> 01:05:55,523
Yeah. Well, it doesn't mean
he killed anybody either. Come on.

825
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:11,420
- Heard you could use one.
- Thanks.

826
01:06:12,039 --> 01:06:16,643
- I quit 10 years ago, you believe this?
- Whatever you need right now.

827
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:20,219
Come on in, I'll get Jimmy.

828
01:06:24,759 --> 01:06:27,918
I got a couple errands I gotta run.
I'll be back in an hour.

829
01:06:27,919 --> 01:06:30,638
You don't have to come back, Celeste.
I'll be fine.

830
01:06:30,639 --> 01:06:31,918
- Sure?
- Celeste Boyle?

831
01:06:31,919 --> 01:06:33,479
Uh, yeah.

832
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:36,919
I'm Sean Devine, an old friend of Dave's.
This is Whitey Powers.

833
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:39,998
- Mrs. Boyle.
- Nice to meet you.

834
01:06:39,999 --> 01:06:41,784
Look, I gotta go.

835
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:46,079
- Oh, damn it.
- What?

836
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:47,918
I left my report pad in the cruiser.

837
01:06:47,919 --> 01:06:50,993
- You better go get it.
- Yeah.

838
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:52,934
Come on.

839
01:06:57,480 --> 01:07:01,358
Hey, Celeste, could I ask you
a quick question?

840
01:07:01,359 --> 01:07:03,838
- Me?
- What time did Dave get home Saturday?

841
01:07:03,839 --> 01:07:05,559
- What?
- It's a little thing.

842
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:09,318
We're running a time line on everything
involving Katie. I'm sure...

843
01:07:09,319 --> 01:07:11,748
...Dave told you he saw her
at McGill's.

844
01:07:12,799 --> 01:07:15,319
You think Dave killed Katie?

845
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:19,187
Oh, no. God. I didn't say that.
Why would I even think that?

846
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:24,199
- I don't know.
- No. It's just that we could figure out...

847
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:27,799
...what time she was on the road
if we knew what time Dave got home.

848
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:30,998
See, it's 5 minutes from your place
to McGill's...

849
01:07:30,999 --> 01:07:34,759
...and Katie left 15 minutes
before Dave did. You see what I mean.

850
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:38,380
I was asleep.

851
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:43,363
Saturday night, when Dave came in,
I was asleep.

852
01:07:43,919 --> 01:07:46,696
Okay. Well, thanks.

853
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:58,278
Bullshit.

854
01:07:58,279 --> 01:07:59,879
No, he was dating Katie, Jim.

855
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:03,559
They were gonna elope to Vegas.
We found tickets under their names.

856
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:05,592
Brendan Harris confirmed it.

857
01:08:05,719 --> 01:08:07,206
Remember what you said?

858
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:12,003
How she looked at you on Saturday like
she was preparing to never see you again?

859
01:08:13,279 --> 01:08:17,119
- Did Brendan Harris kill my daughter?
- No.

860
01:08:17,119 --> 01:08:19,003
You're 100 percent sure?

861
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:23,883
Passed his poly with flying colors, plus it
seemed to me like he really loved her.

862
01:08:26,279 --> 01:08:29,239
Jimmy, I'm just curious, man.

863
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:31,719
Why are you so dead set
against that kid?

864
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:36,084
He said Katie told him you'd disown
her if she ever dated a Harris.

865
01:08:36,839 --> 01:08:40,039
I knew his father. They called him
"Just Ray" Harris.

866
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:41,626
Why is that?

867
01:08:43,279 --> 01:08:45,959
There were so many Rays
in the neighborhood.

868
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:50,563
You had "Crazy Ray" Bucheck,
"Psycho Ray" Dorian.

869
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:54,118
The cool names were taken,
so he got stuck with "Just Ray".

870
01:08:54,119 --> 01:08:57,490
We never got along.
I flat out didn't like him.

871
01:08:57,640 --> 01:09:02,243
And he cut out on his wife when she was
pregnant with that little mute of hers.

872
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:04,678
I don't know.

873
01:09:04,679 --> 01:09:07,678
I just figure the apple doesn't fall
far from the tree.

874
01:09:07,679 --> 01:09:12,283
I didn't want Brendan or any other Harris
dating Katie or any daughter of mine.

875
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:17,438
I can't believe we're talking about
Just Ray Harris.

876
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:20,038
How about this? We've interviewed
witnesses...

877
01:09:20,039 --> 01:09:22,279
...canvassed people
who were in the bar.

878
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:26,279
We've run into more than a few of them
who were questioned...

879
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:29,798
...before us by one or more
of the Savage brothers.

880
01:09:29,799 --> 01:09:33,119
- So?
- So the Savages are not policemen, Jim.

881
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:36,878
- Some people don't talk to policemen.
- With all due respect...

882
01:09:36,879 --> 01:09:39,854
...and just so we're clear,
this is our case.

883
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,638
- How long?
- How long what?

884
01:09:42,639 --> 01:09:45,158
How long before you catch
my daughter's killer?

885
01:09:45,159 --> 01:09:46,746
You bargaining with us?

886
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:49,736
Bargaining?

887
01:09:51,080 --> 01:09:53,260
You giving us a deadline?

888
01:09:55,719 --> 01:10:00,282
We'll speak for Katie, Mr. Markum.
If that's okay with you.

889
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:05,203
Just find my daughter's killer, sergeant.
I'm not standing in your way.

890
01:10:08,559 --> 01:10:12,519
The last thing we need is Markum and
the Savages putting the fear of God...

891
01:10:12,520 --> 01:10:15,598
- ...into the neighborhood.
- We grew up terrified of those brothers.

892
01:10:15,599 --> 01:10:19,239
Eleven months apart, like their mother
ran a loose-cannon factory.

893
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:22,164
Fucking knuckleheads.

894
01:10:24,519 --> 01:10:26,678
Ballistics are in on the Markum murder.

895
01:10:26,679 --> 01:10:30,697
- Yeah, you got a match?
- You're gonna love it.

896
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:34,439
It's a perfect match.
Gun was a .38 Smith.

897
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:38,719
Part of a lot stolen from a gun dealer
in New Hampshire in 1982.

898
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:43,323
The gun that killed Katherine Markum
was used in a liquor-store holdup in 1984.

899
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:45,279
- In Buckingham.
- The Flats?

900
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:49,878
Rome Basin. Place called Looney Liquors.
I pulled the file.

901
01:10:49,879 --> 01:10:53,958
It was a two-man job.
They fired a warning shot into a wall.

902
01:10:53,959 --> 01:10:57,599
- That's where the bullet got pulled.
- Nice work.

903
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:00,178
Thought you'd like that.

904
01:11:28,159 --> 01:11:30,440
It's okay, Ray.

905
01:11:30,759 --> 01:11:32,940
Don't worry about it.

906
01:11:45,959 --> 01:11:47,546
Ma said that?

907
01:11:49,720 --> 01:11:51,206
That I'm better off?

908
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:59,798
I loved her! You know what that's like?

909
01:12:05,959 --> 01:12:08,141
I'm sorry.

910
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:17,660
No, you're wrong.

911
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:21,036
I won't ever feel that again.

912
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:25,883
Right there. Went in through a bottle
of Jack and stuck in the wall right there.

913
01:12:26,399 --> 01:12:30,278
- Scary, huh?
- Scarier than a glass of milk, right?

914
01:12:30,279 --> 01:12:32,919
So take me through it.
These two guys come in...

915
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:37,482
In rubber masks.
They came in through here.

916
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:41,864
That's the storeroom.

917
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:46,079
There's a door back there
that leads to a loading dock.

918
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:48,706
I always keep that door locked.

919
01:12:48,879 --> 01:12:51,879
So they must have had a key.

920
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:55,878
A key? So, what you're saying
is that it was an inside job?

921
01:12:55,879 --> 01:13:00,158
It had to be. One of them, at least,
worked for me at some point.

922
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:04,763
The only reason they fired that warning
shot was they must have known...

923
01:13:05,079 --> 01:13:06,919
...I kept this under the counter.

924
01:13:06,920 --> 01:13:11,234
- And you told the police that at the time.
- Yeah.

925
01:13:11,279 --> 01:13:13,878
Sure, they went through
my employment records.

926
01:13:13,879 --> 01:13:16,519
Questioned everybody
who used to work for me.

927
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:19,638
- Never made an arrest.
- Still have a copy of those records?

928
01:13:19,639 --> 01:13:24,243
Yeah, it's in a box in the office there.
But I know who did it.

929
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:26,119
Oh, yeah?

930
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:28,879
This guy I fired a couple of weeks before.

931
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:32,798
Son of a bitch came in here
a few days after the robbery.

932
01:13:32,799 --> 01:13:36,999
He had this fucking goddamn grin
on his face.

933
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,159
And I just knew.

934
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:42,432
Go tell a grin to a jury, right?

935
01:13:42,440 --> 01:13:44,620
You remember his name?

936
01:13:45,159 --> 01:13:47,399
Do I look senile to you?

937
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:49,798
- No, sir.
- Name...

938
01:13:49,799 --> 01:13:52,079
...was Ray Harris.

939
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:55,698
We used to call him "Just Ray".

940
01:13:57,639 --> 01:14:01,260
You say they used the same gun
for another crime?

941
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:05,933
- That's correct, sir.
- Thanks for your help, Mr. Looney.

942
01:14:16,519 --> 01:14:18,750
Where you been?

943
01:14:19,559 --> 01:14:21,399
Out.

944
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:26,398
What you watching?

945
01:14:26,399 --> 01:14:28,878
Some vampire movie.

946
01:14:29,080 --> 01:14:32,153
Guy just got his head torn off.

947
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:35,817
Where'd you go, Celeste?

948
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:42,079
I was sitting in my car...

949
01:14:42,079 --> 01:14:45,719
...down by the channel.
You know...

950
01:14:45,720 --> 01:14:47,405
...thinking about things.

951
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:52,478
- What'd you think about?
- Oh, you know...

952
01:14:52,479 --> 01:14:56,049
No, actually, I don't know.

953
01:15:00,839 --> 01:15:04,807
Things. You know, the day.

954
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:08,879
About Katie being dead.

955
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:12,251
And poor Annabeth and Jimmy,
you know...

956
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:14,438
...those things.

957
01:15:14,439 --> 01:15:16,819
Those things.

958
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:19,995
Know what I was thinking about, huh?

959
01:15:20,999 --> 01:15:22,833
Vampires.

960
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:25,607
What about them?

961
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:30,279
They're undead...

962
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:33,399
...but I think maybe there's
something beautiful about it.

963
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:36,959
Maybe one day you wake up
and you forget what it's like...

964
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:39,190
...to be human.
Maybe then it's okay.

965
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:42,599
What the fuck you talking about, Dave?

966
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:45,039
Vampires, sweetie. Werewolves.

967
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:47,568
You're not making any sense.

968
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:51,838
You think I killed Katie?

969
01:15:51,839 --> 01:15:54,079
- Celeste.
- What...?

970
01:15:54,079 --> 01:15:58,278
- That the sense we're making these days?
- Where'd you come up with that?

971
01:15:58,279 --> 01:16:01,679
You've barely looked at me since you
found out Katie was dead.

972
01:16:01,680 --> 01:16:03,518
In fact, you seem repulsed by me.

973
01:16:03,519 --> 01:16:05,359
- Dave!
- What?

974
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:09,963
I don't think anything.
I'm confused, okay?

975
01:16:10,079 --> 01:16:11,959
Even your friend Sean
asked about...

976
01:16:11,960 --> 01:16:14,119
He's not my friend, if you didn't know.

977
01:16:14,120 --> 01:16:18,723
He asked me about you.
What time you came home.

978
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:23,158
- What'd you tell him?
- I said I was asleep.

979
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:26,519
- That's good thinking, baby.
- Jesus Christ, Dave!

980
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:29,479
- Why not tell them about the mugger?
- The mugger?

981
01:16:29,480 --> 01:16:32,158
The mugger! I see how
your mind's working. I do.

982
01:16:32,159 --> 01:16:35,399
I come home with blood on me
the same night Katie's murdered.

983
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:37,382
I must have killed her, right?

984
01:16:37,399 --> 01:16:39,432
Fuck!

985
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:07,463
Henry...

986
01:17:07,719 --> 01:17:10,694
What? Henry?

987
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:15,244
Henry and George.

988
01:17:18,239 --> 01:17:20,867
I never told anyone that before.

989
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:23,895
Those were their names.

990
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:28,153
Isn't that fucking hilarious?

991
01:17:30,599 --> 01:17:34,169
At least that's what they called
themselves, but...

992
01:17:34,599 --> 01:17:38,639
...they were wolves, and Dave...

993
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:43,243
...was the boy who escaped
from wolves.

994
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:47,218
What are you talking about, Dave?

995
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:50,065
I'm talking Henry and George.

996
01:17:50,479 --> 01:17:53,802
They took me on a four-day ride.

997
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:58,443
They buried me in this ratty old cellar
with a sleeping bag.

998
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:02,759
And, man, Celeste...

999
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:04,792
...did they have their fun.

1000
01:18:06,279 --> 01:18:10,295
And no one came to help old Dave then.

1001
01:18:11,439 --> 01:18:16,042
Dave had to pretend to be
somebody else.

1002
01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:23,963
You mean, all those years ago...

1003
01:18:26,119 --> 01:18:28,996
...when you were a little boy?

1004
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:31,758
Dave...

1005
01:18:31,759 --> 01:18:34,238
Dave's dead.

1006
01:18:35,079 --> 01:18:39,683
I don't know who came out of that
cellar, but it sure as shit wasn't Dave!

1007
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:41,879
You see, honey...

1008
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:43,558
Fuck!

1009
01:18:43,559 --> 01:18:46,683
It's like vampires.

1010
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,379
Once it's in you...

1011
01:18:52,280 --> 01:18:54,559
...it stays.

1012
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:57,868
What stays?

1013
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:07,617
Did you know there were
child prostitutes in Rome Basin?

1014
01:19:07,719 --> 01:19:09,454
What?

1015
01:19:14,679 --> 01:19:16,464
Fuck!

1016
01:19:19,239 --> 01:19:22,279
I can't trust my mind anymore, Celeste.

1017
01:19:22,280 --> 01:19:24,659
I'm warning you...

1018
01:19:25,959 --> 01:19:28,140
...I can't trust my mind.

1019
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:33,998
I gotta go out,
try to get my head around it.

1020
01:19:36,079 --> 01:19:40,683
Okay.

1021
01:19:46,759 --> 01:19:50,638
- The gun sends us in a different direction.
- I don't see it that way.

1022
01:19:50,639 --> 01:19:53,279
What does Just Ray's gun
have to do with Dave?

1023
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:55,158
These things get passed around.

1024
01:19:55,159 --> 01:19:58,158
Just Ray may have blown town,
but his gun never did.

1025
01:19:58,159 --> 01:20:01,119
I say we talk with Brendan Harris
in the morning.

1026
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:05,199
And I say Dave Boyle. The hand story.
The wife, she's definitely scared.

1027
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:09,639
They're hiding something, but Boyle's
as much a killer as Brendan Harris.

1028
01:20:09,640 --> 01:20:13,798
Boyle fits the profile, a fucking T.
Mid-30s, white, marginally employed...

1029
01:20:13,799 --> 01:20:17,959
...sexually abused as a kid. On paper,
this guy should be in jail already.

1030
01:20:17,960 --> 01:20:20,358
Katie Markum
was not sexually abused, see?

1031
01:20:20,359 --> 01:20:23,759
In that equation,
sexual emission is part of the deal.

1032
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:27,758
You were friends when you were kids.
This makes you a fucking liability.

1033
01:20:27,759 --> 01:20:29,158
Hey, he's not my friend.

1034
01:20:29,159 --> 01:20:33,763
Turns out you're right, I'll have my cuffs
off my hip faster than yours.

1035
01:20:47,480 --> 01:20:49,412
Hey, Jimmy.

1036
01:20:50,240 --> 01:20:51,879
You're out late.

1037
01:20:51,880 --> 01:20:53,912
Yeah, you too.

1038
01:20:54,919 --> 01:20:56,878
It's cold, huh?

1039
01:20:56,879 --> 01:20:59,556
Yeah, I guess.

1040
01:21:06,199 --> 01:21:08,083
You know, I...

1041
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:10,318
I been sitting out here...

1042
01:21:10,319 --> 01:21:12,847
...over the last few years...

1043
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:18,803
...waiting on Katie to get back
from someplace.

1044
01:21:19,079 --> 01:21:23,683
About midnight, I'd say to Annabeth,
"I'm gonna sit on the porch for a while."

1045
01:21:28,239 --> 01:21:30,421
Weird thing is...

1046
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:33,318
...it seemed to bring her back.

1047
01:21:37,159 --> 01:21:39,588
I saw her, you know.

1048
01:21:40,879 --> 01:21:42,719
Saw who?

1049
01:21:42,720 --> 01:21:46,388
Katie. I was at McGill's Saturday night.

1050
01:21:47,599 --> 01:21:52,203
- You saw Katie Saturday night?
- Never got around to telling you.

1051
01:21:54,439 --> 01:21:56,422
Did you talk to her?

1052
01:21:56,840 --> 01:21:59,814
Just nodded hello at one point.

1053
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:03,014
Next time I looked up, she was gone.

1054
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:09,999
But, uh...

1055
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:11,883
...Jimmy...

1056
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:15,199
...she looked, um...

1057
01:22:16,040 --> 01:22:17,823
...happy.

1058
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:37,563
Uh, I got more walking to do.
Good night.

1059
01:22:48,239 --> 01:22:51,518
- You stole his car.
- His car was officially towed.

1060
01:22:51,519 --> 01:22:55,358
- From the front of his house.
- No! It was abandoned in Rome Basin...

1061
01:22:55,359 --> 01:22:56,959
...adjacent to the parkway.

1062
01:22:56,960 --> 01:23:01,479
Lucky for us, the parkway's state
jurisdiction. Some kids jacked the car...

1063
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:05,078
- ...they took it for a joy ride...
- What? Why'd you do it?

1064
01:23:05,079 --> 01:23:09,683
After I left last night, I decided to talk
to Boyle myself, put some fear into him.

1065
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:14,563
I get to his house, I decide to look in
his car, see what he's got. I find blood.

1066
01:23:14,719 --> 01:23:17,479
- Blood?
- Front seat of Dave's car. B-negative.

1067
01:23:17,480 --> 01:23:21,319
- How much?
- A bit. Found more in the trunk. A lot.

1068
01:23:21,320 --> 01:23:24,199
Type O, same type as Katie Markum.

1069
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:26,999
Wait, Katie Markum
never got in anybody's trunk.

1070
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,798
She was chased through the park
where she died.

1071
01:23:29,799 --> 01:23:33,638
- It's enough to ask questions.
- Your search is gonna get tossed out.

1072
01:23:33,639 --> 01:23:38,243
No, found and abandoned in state
jurisdiction, for insurance purposes.

1073
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:42,599
- In the best interest of the owner.
- Get a physical search, file the report.

1074
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:44,384
Bingo.

1075
01:23:44,680 --> 01:23:47,559
So, you wanna talk to him,
or should I send him home?

1076
01:23:47,560 --> 01:23:50,598
- Dave's here?
- I've had him in the box for an hour.

1077
01:23:50,599 --> 01:23:54,319
Sent two of my biggest, ugliest troopers
to pick him up.

1078
01:23:55,320 --> 01:23:56,678
Come on, Mr. Boyle!

1079
01:23:56,679 --> 01:24:00,358
We know you didn't get that swollen
hand sticking it in the garbage disposal.

1080
01:24:00,359 --> 01:24:04,963
- Oh, yeah? How do you know that?
- Why's your wife afraid of you?

1081
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:08,454
She know what really happened
to your hand?

1082
01:24:13,919 --> 01:24:16,838
How about a Sprite or something?

1083
01:24:16,839 --> 01:24:20,879
How about you tell us what really
happened Saturday night, Mr. Boyle?

1084
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:22,519
You lied.

1085
01:24:22,520 --> 01:24:25,119
That's your opinion,
which you're entitled to.

1086
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:29,723
- Hey, you think this is funny?
- No, I don't. I'm tired, I'm hung-over.

1087
01:24:29,959 --> 01:24:34,399
Not only was my car stolen last night,
but now you won't release it to me.

1088
01:24:34,399 --> 01:24:36,283
Okay.

1089
01:24:37,359 --> 01:24:39,342
All right.

1090
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:42,598
Tell us, Mr. Boyle,
how did you get the blood in your car?

1091
01:24:42,599 --> 01:24:45,774
- What blood?
- Let's start with the front seat.

1092
01:24:46,999 --> 01:24:49,379
What are you looking at him for?

1093
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:54,599
Hey, you think I could get
that Sprite, Sean?

1094
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:56,318
Sure.

1095
01:24:56,319 --> 01:24:58,699
Oh, I get it.

1096
01:24:58,840 --> 01:25:01,021
You're the good cop.

1097
01:25:01,080 --> 01:25:04,199
How about a meatball sub
while you're at it?

1098
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:07,969
I ain't your bitch, Dave.
Looks like you'll have to wait.

1099
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:12,187
Yeah, but you're someone's bitch,
aren't you, Sean?

1100
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:17,684
The blood on your front seat, Dave.
Answer the sergeant.

1101
01:25:19,519 --> 01:25:22,679
We got a chainlink fence
in our back yard.

1102
01:25:22,680 --> 01:25:26,358
Me and my kid play Wiffle Ball
every afternoon after school.

1103
01:25:26,359 --> 01:25:30,519
He's getting good, so most of the balls
are on the other side of the fence.

1104
01:25:30,520 --> 01:25:33,239
So I climb it.
Except I slip...

1105
01:25:33,240 --> 01:25:36,478
...slice myself where the links curl in,
right here.

1106
01:25:36,479 --> 01:25:38,599
Bled like hell.

1107
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:42,278
Ten minutes later,
I gotta pick up Michael at school.

1108
01:25:42,279 --> 01:25:45,479
Probably was still bleeding
when I got in the front seat.

1109
01:25:45,480 --> 01:25:47,512
What blood type are you?

1110
01:25:47,759 --> 01:25:49,599
B-negative.

1111
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:52,759
Yeah? That's the match we got.

1112
01:25:52,760 --> 01:25:54,919
- Well, there you go.
- Not quite.

1113
01:25:54,920 --> 01:25:57,894
Blood in the trunk of the car
wasn't B-negative.

1114
01:25:58,599 --> 01:26:01,959
I don't know anything
about any blood in the trunk.

1115
01:26:01,960 --> 01:26:05,158
No idea how half a pint of blood
got in the trunk?

1116
01:26:05,159 --> 01:26:08,359
- None.
- This is not the way you wanna go.

1117
01:26:08,360 --> 01:26:10,159
How will that look in court?

1118
01:26:10,160 --> 01:26:14,078
You not knowing how someone else's
blood got in the trunk of your car?

1119
01:26:14,079 --> 01:26:17,358
Gonna look fine, I suppose.
You filed the report.

1120
01:26:17,359 --> 01:26:19,438
What report?

1121
01:26:19,439 --> 01:26:23,879
The stolen-car report. The car
wasn't in my possession last night.

1122
01:26:23,880 --> 01:26:26,999
So whatever the thieves used it for,
you should find out...

1123
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:30,073
...because it sounds like they
were up to no good.

1124
01:26:35,240 --> 01:26:38,839
Things looking any better
on the Sprite, Sean?

1125
01:26:38,840 --> 01:26:42,399
Well, you just got too fucking smart.
The car is inadmissible.

1126
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:45,119
Anything there, his lawyers say
was put by thieves.

1127
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:47,759
- I can break him.
- He just kicked our asses!

1128
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:49,998
You still think Dave
wouldn't hurt a fly...

1129
01:26:49,999 --> 01:26:52,358
- Is that the point? No.
- What is the point?

1130
01:26:52,359 --> 01:26:56,519
We can break this open on the gun.
It's the gun.

1131
01:26:56,520 --> 01:26:59,295
Okay. Maybe.

1132
01:27:01,160 --> 01:27:03,142
So, what do we do with Dave?

1133
01:27:04,360 --> 01:27:06,194
Fuck it. Kick him loose.

1134
01:27:06,680 --> 01:27:10,639
Maybe a Celtic cross.
That's always a popular choice.

1135
01:27:10,640 --> 01:27:14,557
Or this lovely red marble here.

1136
01:27:14,600 --> 01:27:16,519
Or a figural.

1137
01:27:16,520 --> 01:27:18,403
That one.

1138
01:27:18,519 --> 01:27:22,685
Very good. Nice and simple.

1139
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:31,932
Hey, Jimmy!

1140
01:27:34,839 --> 01:27:37,417
Annabeth said you were here.

1141
01:27:38,200 --> 01:27:40,399
We been asking around, like you said to.

1142
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:42,039
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1143
01:27:42,040 --> 01:27:45,199
Jimmy, this ain't about the two-year bit
you did for me.

1144
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:47,519
And it ain't about me
missing your brains running things.

1145
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:48,678
I know.

1146
01:27:48,679 --> 01:27:52,798
Katie was my niece. Not by birth, but
she was part of our family, we loved her.

1147
01:27:52,799 --> 01:27:55,825
I don't question you, Val.
What's up?

1148
01:27:56,560 --> 01:28:01,163
Cops are all over this. Doing their job
for once. Bars, street trade, everything.

1149
01:28:01,319 --> 01:28:04,799
Every hooker we talked to, bartender,
already been questioned.

1150
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:08,679
- The fucking law has descended, Jimmy.
- What about Just Ray's kid?

1151
01:28:08,680 --> 01:28:12,639
Quiet as a mouse.
Kid's no trouble to anyone.

1152
01:28:12,640 --> 01:28:15,998
I talked to Diane and Eve.
They said he loved her.

1153
01:28:15,999 --> 01:28:19,023
Jimmy, they said that she loved him.

1154
01:28:20,359 --> 01:28:22,919
- Want us to take a run at him?
- No.

1155
01:28:22,920 --> 01:28:27,283
Hold off for now.
Anything else?

1156
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:30,904
What?

1157
01:28:33,559 --> 01:28:36,319
Val, you wanna spit something, spit it.

1158
01:28:36,319 --> 01:28:38,153
Tell him.

1159
01:28:39,400 --> 01:28:42,438
Sean Devine and his partner
went by and saw Dave Boyle.

1160
01:28:42,439 --> 01:28:46,679
Dave was at McGill's. Probably
questioning him like everybody else.

1161
01:28:46,680 --> 01:28:49,038
I heard something else this morning too.

1162
01:28:49,039 --> 01:28:53,643
- Two staties came by in uniform.
- Maybe forgot to ask him something.

1163
01:28:54,119 --> 01:28:56,919
No. When they left,
they took him with them.

1164
01:28:56,920 --> 01:29:00,588
They put him in the back seat,
if you know what I mean.

1165
01:29:14,760 --> 01:29:18,518
Raymond Matthew Harris,
born 9-6-1957.

1166
01:29:18,519 --> 01:29:21,199
First child, Brendan Seamus, born 1983.

1167
01:29:21,200 --> 01:29:25,798
Same year that Just Ray is indicted
in a scam to embezzle subway tokens.

1168
01:29:25,799 --> 01:29:28,199
Charges are dropped, and he's fired.

1169
01:29:28,200 --> 01:29:32,358
Does odd jobs after that,
including clerking at Looney Liquors.

1170
01:29:32,359 --> 01:29:36,963
Questioned in that robbery. Questioned in
another, same year, Blanchard Liquors...

1171
01:29:37,240 --> 01:29:39,559
...released on lack of evidence again.

1172
01:29:39,560 --> 01:29:42,319
- Beginning to become known, though.
- He's getting popular.

1173
01:29:42,320 --> 01:29:46,518
A known associate,
one Edmund Reese, fingers Raymond...

1174
01:29:46,519 --> 01:29:50,119
...in the 1985 heist
of a rare comic-book collection.

1175
01:29:50,120 --> 01:29:51,718
Comic books? You go, Ray.

1176
01:29:51,719 --> 01:29:54,438
Hey, hey, hey, excuse me,
$150,000 worth of comic books.

1177
01:29:54,439 --> 01:29:56,279
Oh, excuse me.

1178
01:29:56,280 --> 01:30:00,198
Raymond returned said literature
unharmed. Does a year solid inside.

1179
01:30:01,640 --> 01:30:04,198
Comes out with a chemical-dependency
problem.

1180
01:30:04,199 --> 01:30:06,118
Gets honest work
to support the habit, though?

1181
01:30:06,119 --> 01:30:08,718
Evidently not.

1182
01:30:08,719 --> 01:30:13,039
Picked up in a joint
MCU-FBI sting operation...

1183
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:17,478
...trafficking stolen goods across state
lines. Stole a truckload of cigarettes.

1184
01:30:17,479 --> 01:30:20,358
- The boy's got style.
- Got a boatload of grief too.

1185
01:30:20,359 --> 01:30:24,963
Stole the truck in Rhode Island,
drove it into Massachusetts.

1186
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:29,603
- Hence, the federal interstate rap.
- Hence, they got him by the balls, but...

1187
01:30:29,800 --> 01:30:31,782
...he does no time.

1188
01:30:32,159 --> 01:30:35,598
- He rolled on someone.
- Looks that way. After that, he's clean.

1189
01:30:35,599 --> 01:30:39,878
- August 1989, poof, he disappears.
- One, dead, two, in Witness Protection.

1190
01:30:39,879 --> 01:30:43,199
Three, he goes deep underground,
then pops back up...

1191
01:30:43,200 --> 01:30:46,799
...to murder his son's 19-year-old
girlfriend? We got nothing.

1192
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:51,398
A prime suspect in a robbery 18 years
ago, during which the weapon was used.

1193
01:30:51,399 --> 01:30:55,719
The guy's son dated the victim.
I say we got a lot.

1194
01:30:55,720 --> 01:30:58,159
Anything about Just Ray's
known associates?

1195
01:30:58,160 --> 01:31:00,838
Let's take a look.

1196
01:31:00,839 --> 01:31:05,443
Reginald 'Dukie' Neil, Kevin
'Whackjob' Sirraci, Nicholas Savage...

1197
01:31:06,120 --> 01:31:07,438
...Anthony Waxman.

1198
01:31:10,159 --> 01:31:12,340
And one James Markum.

1199
01:31:14,080 --> 01:31:16,905
And the hits just keep on coming.

1200
01:31:20,080 --> 01:31:23,559
- You looking for me?
- I'm Sean Devine. This is Whitey Powers.

1201
01:31:23,560 --> 01:31:25,918
I already gotta get back.

1202
01:31:25,919 --> 01:31:29,159
So you worked a task force
with Major Crimes in the '80s?

1203
01:31:29,160 --> 01:31:32,678
- Bunch of them.
- You took down a smalltimer, Ray Harris.

1204
01:31:32,679 --> 01:31:37,198
He stole a truckload of cigarettes from
a rest stop in Cranston, Rhode Island.

1205
01:31:37,199 --> 01:31:40,279
Trucker went to take a piss,
Harris guy jacks the truck.

1206
01:31:40,280 --> 01:31:42,678
I think we pulled him over
in New Bedford.

1207
01:31:42,679 --> 01:31:43,918
But Harris walked.

1208
01:31:44,159 --> 01:31:46,238
He didn't walk, he rolled.

1209
01:31:46,239 --> 01:31:50,439
Boston Police Anti-Gang Unit stepped in
for info on another case. He rolled.

1210
01:31:50,440 --> 01:31:52,323
On who?

1211
01:31:52,679 --> 01:31:54,799
What the fuck was the name?

1212
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:58,759
Him and three other guys knocked over
the MBTA counting room, 60 grand.

1213
01:31:58,760 --> 01:32:00,719
Jimmy Markum.

1214
01:32:00,720 --> 01:32:05,323
Kid was 19, 20. Slick as hell, man.
Ran a crew, never got arrested.

1215
01:32:05,719 --> 01:32:08,519
So did Harris ever testify in open court?

1216
01:32:08,520 --> 01:32:12,119
Never went. Markum dummied up
on the guys he was working with...

1217
01:32:12,120 --> 01:32:15,878
...DA was afraid he wouldn't be able
to convict. So he cut a deal.

1218
01:32:15,879 --> 01:32:18,158
Two years inside,
couple more suspended.

1219
01:32:18,159 --> 01:32:22,375
So Jimmy Markum never knew
that Ray Harris ratted him out?

1220
01:32:22,760 --> 01:32:25,359
Ray Harris disappeared
about two months...

1221
01:32:25,360 --> 01:32:28,358
...after Markum rotated back
into the free world.

1222
01:32:28,359 --> 01:32:30,342
What's that tell you?

1223
01:32:40,839 --> 01:32:43,558
Hey, Jimmy. Hey, Val.

1224
01:32:43,559 --> 01:32:46,438
- Hey, coz, how you doing?
- I'm good.

1225
01:32:46,439 --> 01:32:49,158
Okay. Hey.

1226
01:32:49,159 --> 01:32:51,758
- Hey, Celeste.
- Hey, Jimmy. Hey.

1227
01:32:51,759 --> 01:32:56,272
- Can I talk to you for a sec?
- I'll catch up with you in a minute.

1228
01:32:58,280 --> 01:33:00,262
Step into my office.

1229
01:33:11,640 --> 01:33:13,275
Beautiful day, huh?

1230
01:33:20,760 --> 01:33:23,189
Whatever it is, Celeste, it's okay.

1231
01:33:28,360 --> 01:33:31,239
I took Michael last night...

1232
01:33:31,240 --> 01:33:33,272
...and I went to a motel.

1233
01:33:34,999 --> 01:33:36,486
Okay.

1234
01:33:37,240 --> 01:33:39,421
I don't know, Jim.

1235
01:33:40,359 --> 01:33:42,739
I might have left Dave for good.

1236
01:33:43,720 --> 01:33:45,950
You left Dave?

1237
01:33:48,640 --> 01:33:50,424
Yeah.

1238
01:33:51,240 --> 01:33:53,024
Well...

1239
01:33:54,199 --> 01:33:58,117
...he's been acting kind of nuts lately.

1240
01:33:59,919 --> 01:34:02,101
I'm almost afraid of him.

1241
01:34:05,760 --> 01:34:07,842
Do you know something?

1242
01:34:10,440 --> 01:34:13,958
I know he was taken in by the cops
this morning.

1243
01:34:13,959 --> 01:34:15,959
He saw Katie the night
she was murdered.

1244
01:34:15,960 --> 01:34:19,239
Didn't tell me about it
till after the cops questioned him.

1245
01:34:19,240 --> 01:34:23,843
I know he's got a hand that looks like
it's been punching a fucking wall.

1246
01:34:24,079 --> 01:34:26,806
Is there anything else I should know?

1247
01:34:33,799 --> 01:34:35,683
Come here.

1248
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:39,623
Okay.

1249
01:34:40,320 --> 01:34:42,799
At 3 in the morning...

1250
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:47,403
...on Sunday, Dave came back to the
apartment covered in someone's blood.

1251
01:34:51,720 --> 01:34:54,099
What did he say happened?

1252
01:34:55,199 --> 01:34:58,719
That he was mugged.
That he...

1253
01:34:58,720 --> 01:35:01,559
He bashed the mugger's head
in the street.

1254
01:35:01,560 --> 01:35:02,918
That...

1255
01:35:02,919 --> 01:35:05,696
That he might have killed him.

1256
01:35:11,559 --> 01:35:15,180
But there was nothing in the paper.

1257
01:35:22,799 --> 01:35:27,403
- Celeste?
- Yeah?

1258
01:35:30,039 --> 01:35:31,824
Celeste?

1259
01:35:35,760 --> 01:35:38,635
Do you think Dave killed my Katie?

1260
01:35:42,919 --> 01:35:44,998
Okay. All right.

1261
01:35:44,999 --> 01:35:46,784
Okay.

1262
01:35:47,400 --> 01:35:49,581
Oh, God.

1263
01:35:55,119 --> 01:35:56,904
Okay.

1264
01:35:59,040 --> 01:36:01,469
Oh, my God.

1265
01:36:02,159 --> 01:36:05,199
- Tell me about your father.
- What?

1266
01:36:05,200 --> 01:36:09,278
Your father, Ray Sr.
You remember him.

1267
01:36:09,279 --> 01:36:13,743
- I was 6 when he left us.
- So you don't remember the guy?

1268
01:36:13,919 --> 01:36:16,597
I remember little things.

1269
01:36:16,839 --> 01:36:20,039
He smelled like Schlitz and Dentyne.

1270
01:36:20,040 --> 01:36:21,824
He...

1271
01:36:22,120 --> 01:36:23,954
He what?

1272
01:36:24,519 --> 01:36:29,123
He carried a lot of change in his pocket.
It jingled when he walked.

1273
01:36:29,319 --> 01:36:31,559
You could always hear him
coming home.

1274
01:36:31,560 --> 01:36:36,163
And if I guessed how much he had,
even if I was close, he'd give it to me.

1275
01:36:37,440 --> 01:36:40,238
You remember your father having a gun?

1276
01:36:40,239 --> 01:36:41,798
No.

1277
01:36:41,799 --> 01:36:46,403
Well, you seem awfully sure for
somebody who was 6 when he left.

1278
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:48,439
What's up?

1279
01:36:48,440 --> 01:36:51,319
- What's that?
- This is what you asked for.

1280
01:36:51,320 --> 01:36:55,878
CSS reports, ballistics, fingerprint
analysis, the 911 tape. Bunch of stuff.

1281
01:36:55,879 --> 01:36:57,862
- All right, thanks.
- Yeah.

1282
01:36:58,160 --> 01:37:01,282
We were talking about your father's gun.

1283
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:06,203
- I told you, my father didn't have a gun.
- Oh, well, I guess we were misinformed.

1284
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:10,598
- So when was the last time you talked?
- Never.

1285
01:37:10,599 --> 01:37:11,999
Never?

1286
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,359
He went out for a drink
and never came back.

1287
01:37:14,360 --> 01:37:17,879
But your mother never filed
a missing person's report. Why not?

1288
01:37:17,880 --> 01:37:19,679
Because he's not missing.

1289
01:37:19,680 --> 01:37:23,038
- He sends money every month.
- Sends money?

1290
01:37:23,039 --> 01:37:27,643
Five hundred bucks every month.
Like clockwork.

1291
01:37:28,040 --> 01:37:31,559
- From where?
- Postmark says Brooklyn.

1292
01:37:32,359 --> 01:37:35,534
- How do you know it's him?
- Who else would it be?

1293
01:37:37,599 --> 01:37:40,029
Who else would send it?

1294
01:37:40,680 --> 01:37:42,839
My ma says that's the way he was.

1295
01:37:42,840 --> 01:37:46,311
Do something shitty,
then he'd try to make up for it.

1296
01:37:49,160 --> 01:37:52,531
Why do you keep asking me
if my father had a gun?

1297
01:37:53,720 --> 01:37:55,454
You know why, kid.

1298
01:37:55,640 --> 01:37:57,176
No, I don't.

1299
01:37:57,800 --> 01:37:59,719
The gun that killed your girlfriend...

1300
01:37:59,720 --> 01:38:03,264
...was the same gun your father used
in a robbery 18 years ago.

1301
01:38:03,359 --> 01:38:04,847
So...

1302
01:38:05,159 --> 01:38:07,539
...you wanna tell me about it?

1303
01:38:09,959 --> 01:38:12,359
My father didn't have a gun.

1304
01:38:12,360 --> 01:38:14,739
You are fucking lying!

1305
01:38:20,359 --> 01:38:22,491
Can I go now?

1306
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:26,121
Or are you gonna charge me
with Katie's murder?

1307
01:38:38,120 --> 01:38:42,483
Hey! Dandy Dave Boyle,
how's it hanging?

1308
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:44,599
Hey, Val.

1309
01:38:44,600 --> 01:38:47,326
Nick. How you guys holding up?

1310
01:38:47,480 --> 01:38:49,958
- All right.
- It's fucked up.

1311
01:38:51,799 --> 01:38:53,584
Katie.

1312
01:38:54,600 --> 01:38:56,781
A fucking tragedy.

1313
01:38:57,480 --> 01:38:58,839
Yeah.

1314
01:38:58,840 --> 01:39:01,759
We're gonna get a couple of beers
and a bite to eat.

1315
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:03,246
Yeah?

1316
01:39:03,719 --> 01:39:06,038
Yeah. What do you say, man?

1317
01:39:06,039 --> 01:39:10,552
How about a boys' night out
in the middle of the day?

1318
01:39:12,199 --> 01:39:15,918
- I gotta get home after a while.
- Don't we all? Hop in.

1319
01:39:15,919 --> 01:39:18,051
- Come on, get in.
- All right.

1320
01:39:18,760 --> 01:39:22,527
Well, the first round's on me.

1321
01:39:23,400 --> 01:39:25,828
Now you're talking.

1322
01:39:43,120 --> 01:39:45,319
I think the kid is lying about the gun.

1323
01:39:45,320 --> 01:39:47,799
Absolutely. I told you
three times already.

1324
01:39:47,800 --> 01:39:52,403
- What about the father?
- I don't know. Maybe Just Ray is alive.

1325
01:39:52,959 --> 01:39:54,438
Eighty grand. I mean...

1326
01:39:54,439 --> 01:39:58,804
...who else is gonna send
that kind of money if not the father?

1327
01:39:58,959 --> 01:40:02,599
Listen, go home, have a drink.

1328
01:40:02,600 --> 01:40:06,079
- Let it go for a while.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1329
01:40:06,080 --> 01:40:08,479
Hey, anything good on the 911?

1330
01:40:08,479 --> 01:40:12,744
- I thought you listened to it.
- I thought you listened to it.

1331
01:40:16,040 --> 01:40:19,239
911, police services.
What's the nature of your emergency?

1332
01:40:19,240 --> 01:40:22,479
There's, like, this car
with blood in it, and the door's open.

1333
01:40:22,480 --> 01:40:25,478
- What's the location of the car?
- Sydney Street.

1334
01:40:25,479 --> 01:40:29,239
It's in the Flats by Pen Park.
Me and my friend, we just found it.

1335
01:40:29,240 --> 01:40:32,119
- Son, what's your name?
- He wants to know her name.

1336
01:40:32,120 --> 01:40:35,239
- Your name, what's your name?
- We're so fucking out of here.

1337
01:40:35,240 --> 01:40:37,319
Good luck, man.

1338
01:40:37,320 --> 01:40:41,319
That about cracks the case, don't it?
Let's get a burger or something.

1339
01:40:41,320 --> 01:40:43,203
Her.

1340
01:40:43,559 --> 01:40:46,919
- What?
- The kid on the tape.

1341
01:40:50,880 --> 01:40:53,958
- Son, what's your name?
- He wants to know her name.

1342
01:40:53,959 --> 01:40:58,078
- He said, "her name".
- She's a dead girl, refer to her as a she.

1343
01:40:58,079 --> 01:41:00,718
How does the kid know?
Girl's dead in the park.

1344
01:41:00,719 --> 01:41:04,737
How does he know the blood in the car
came from a woman?

1345
01:41:08,399 --> 01:41:09,986
Play it again.

1346
01:41:15,720 --> 01:41:19,238
This one time, we're going
to take down this stamp collector.

1347
01:41:19,239 --> 01:41:21,599
- Tie him up, rob him, we're out.
- Here.

1348
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:24,919
It was me, Nicky and this kid
Carson Leverett.

1349
01:41:24,920 --> 01:41:27,679
Mm, fucking Carson.

1350
01:41:27,680 --> 01:41:31,799
I swear, this kid couldn't tie his own
fucking shoe if you didn't show him.

1351
01:41:31,800 --> 01:41:34,278
We all wear suits
because we want to fit in.

1352
01:41:34,279 --> 01:41:38,883
We're in the elevator, it stops, this old
lady gets on. She starts screaming!

1353
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:44,438
Now Val turns to me,
but I'm looking at Carson.

1354
01:41:44,439 --> 01:41:46,518
I'm thinking, "What the fuck?"

1355
01:41:46,519 --> 01:41:51,123
Because that fucking bonehead's
still got his Ronald Reagan mask on!

1356
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:53,842
Fucking smiley mask!

1357
01:41:55,800 --> 01:41:57,399
Idiot!

1358
01:41:57,400 --> 01:42:00,325
And you guys didn't notice till then?

1359
01:42:01,599 --> 01:42:05,919
Shit like that happened all the time on
jobs. That's why Jimmy was so missed.

1360
01:42:05,920 --> 01:42:09,241
He saw shit happen
before it even went down.

1361
01:42:11,039 --> 01:42:13,468
Why do you think he went straight?

1362
01:42:15,599 --> 01:42:18,524
One word, pure and simple. Katie.

1363
01:42:20,320 --> 01:42:22,501
What about you guys?

1364
01:42:23,239 --> 01:42:27,752
What? Us? Going straight?

1365
01:42:28,240 --> 01:42:31,165
That's pretty fucking funny!

1366
01:42:34,200 --> 01:42:38,803
We're like bats, we like night too much.
Days are just good for sleeping through.

1367
01:42:38,919 --> 01:42:40,902
Want another shot?

1368
01:42:43,959 --> 01:42:46,639
You know, I should slow down
till we eat.

1369
01:42:46,640 --> 01:42:49,158
Come on, don't go fucking pussy on us!

1370
01:42:49,159 --> 01:42:50,845
Come on, get up.

1371
01:42:55,560 --> 01:42:57,939
Live a little, huh?

1372
01:43:23,719 --> 01:43:26,000
Slide over, Dave.

1373
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:30,119
- Dave.
- All right, Val! Now you're talking.

1374
01:43:30,120 --> 01:43:34,236
- How you doing?
- I'm a little drunk.

1375
01:43:36,079 --> 01:43:38,211
To our children.

1376
01:43:42,440 --> 01:43:44,769
- I always liked this bar.
- Yeah.

1377
01:43:45,679 --> 01:43:47,839
Yeah, nobody bothers you.

1378
01:43:47,840 --> 01:43:50,918
The way it should be,
nobody to bother you in this life.

1379
01:43:50,919 --> 01:43:54,519
No one fucking with you
or your loved ones. Right, Dave?

1380
01:43:54,520 --> 01:43:57,159
- Absolutely.
- Absolutely.

1381
01:43:57,160 --> 01:43:59,798
This guy's a hoot.
He can really get you going.

1382
01:43:59,799 --> 01:44:01,239
Yeah.

1383
01:44:01,240 --> 01:44:03,078
Oh, yeah, my man Dave.

1384
01:44:08,559 --> 01:44:10,840
Kevin, will you bring us a bottle?

1385
01:44:21,160 --> 01:44:24,481
- Drink up, Dave.
- Come on.

1386
01:44:24,519 --> 01:44:26,502
Thanks, Kevin.

1387
01:45:00,839 --> 01:45:03,919
Remember we took Ray Harris here
that time?

1388
01:45:03,920 --> 01:45:08,523
Everybody called this guy "Just Ray",
but Val here called him "Ray Jingles".

1389
01:45:11,399 --> 01:45:14,239
This guy walked around
with 10 bucks in change...

1390
01:45:14,240 --> 01:45:17,239
...in case he had to make a call
to Iraq or something.

1391
01:45:17,240 --> 01:45:19,519
Are you all right, Dave? Dave?

1392
01:45:19,519 --> 01:45:22,439
- You all right?
- Shit. I'm gonna be sick.

1393
01:45:22,440 --> 01:45:24,038
Come on. Come on, now.

1394
01:45:24,039 --> 01:45:28,643
Dave, use the back door. Huey
don't like cleaning it off the toilet rims.

1395
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:52,685
Hey, Ray.

1396
01:46:04,999 --> 01:46:08,322
You guys come to make sure
I didn't fall in?

1397
01:46:12,360 --> 01:46:14,541
Come here a second.

1398
01:46:19,399 --> 01:46:21,234
Sit down.

1399
01:46:29,880 --> 01:46:32,679
Let me tell you about Ray Harris.

1400
01:46:32,680 --> 01:46:36,958
He was a buddy of mine.
He used to visit me in prison.

1401
01:46:36,959 --> 01:46:41,563
He checked in on Marita and Katie,
my mother, if they needed anything.

1402
01:46:41,720 --> 01:46:44,358
He's also the one who put me in.
He ratted me out.

1403
01:46:44,359 --> 01:46:47,039
- Shit, that's terrible.
- My wife had cancer at the time.

1404
01:46:47,040 --> 01:46:49,598
- Yeah, I remember.
- Ray robbed me of being with her...

1405
01:46:49,599 --> 01:46:50,958
...when she was dying.

1406
01:46:50,959 --> 01:46:55,198
The death part you do alone, but I could
have helped her with the dying.

1407
01:46:55,199 --> 01:46:57,319
Why are you telling me this?

1408
01:46:57,320 --> 01:47:01,518
I knelt Ray down over there and
I shot him twice, in his throat and chest.

1409
01:47:01,519 --> 01:47:04,039
- We were both crying when I did it.
- Jimmy...

1410
01:47:04,040 --> 01:47:05,679
He was begging.

1411
01:47:05,680 --> 01:47:08,952
You know, pregnant wife, little Brendan.

1412
01:47:09,240 --> 01:47:13,478
He said he knew me.
He said I was a good man.

1413
01:47:13,479 --> 01:47:16,850
What do you think, Dave?
You think I'm a good man?

1414
01:47:16,999 --> 01:47:18,685
Who do you hate?

1415
01:47:20,520 --> 01:47:22,199
Come on, who?

1416
01:47:22,200 --> 01:47:23,984
No one.

1417
01:47:25,840 --> 01:47:30,443
- What is it you think I did?
- As I was holding him under the water...

1418
01:47:30,599 --> 01:47:34,119
...I could feel God watching me,
shaking his head. Not angry...

1419
01:47:34,120 --> 01:47:36,839
...but like if a puppy shit on a rug.

1420
01:47:36,840 --> 01:47:38,624
Who do you love?

1421
01:47:42,720 --> 01:47:44,702
You love me.

1422
01:47:46,399 --> 01:47:48,035
What about Ma?

1423
01:47:52,760 --> 01:47:57,025
You love me so much,
I wanna hear you say it.

1424
01:47:59,080 --> 01:48:03,199
- You think I killed Katie, don't you?
- Don't talk, Dave. Don't talk.

1425
01:48:03,200 --> 01:48:06,238
No, I killed someone,
but I didn't kill Katie.

1426
01:48:06,239 --> 01:48:08,038
This is the mugger story.

1427
01:48:08,039 --> 01:48:10,279
He wasn't a mugger,
he was a child molester.

1428
01:48:10,280 --> 01:48:12,558
He was having sex with
this kid in his car.

1429
01:48:12,559 --> 01:48:17,072
He was a fucking wolf!
He was a vampire!

1430
01:48:24,040 --> 01:48:25,526
Get out of here.

1431
01:48:37,480 --> 01:48:39,165
Run!

1432
01:48:39,439 --> 01:48:41,373
Dave, run!

1433
01:48:43,080 --> 01:48:47,439
- You killed a child molester.
- Yeah. Well, me and the boy.

1434
01:48:47,440 --> 01:48:50,438
- The molested boy helped you.
- Oh, no. No...

1435
01:48:50,439 --> 01:48:55,039
- You just said you and the boy!
- No, forget that!

1436
01:48:55,040 --> 01:48:59,643
- My head gets fucked up sometimes.
- Your wife thinks you killed my daughter.

1437
01:49:00,600 --> 01:49:03,959
You'd rather have her think that
than you killed a child molester?

1438
01:49:03,960 --> 01:49:07,479
People don't care if a child molester dies.
Why not tell the truth?

1439
01:49:07,480 --> 01:49:11,879
I don't know. Maybe I thought
I was turning into him.

1440
01:49:11,880 --> 01:49:14,507
I didn't kill Katie.

1441
01:49:14,760 --> 01:49:18,879
I don't remember hearing anything about
any guy's body being found.

1442
01:49:18,880 --> 01:49:23,159
- I put him in the trunk of my car.
- Letting this piece of shit explain?

1443
01:49:23,160 --> 01:49:26,198
- Fuck him. Fuck him! Do him!
- I didn't kill her!

1444
01:49:26,199 --> 01:49:30,198
Shut up! Shut the fuck up!
Everybody shut up!

1445
01:49:30,199 --> 01:49:33,799
This is my daughter I'm talking about!
Shut up!

1446
01:49:33,800 --> 01:49:35,386
- Fuck!
- Shut up!

1447
01:49:39,160 --> 01:49:40,559
Nineteen years old.

1448
01:49:40,560 --> 01:49:43,078
- I didn't kill Katie!
- Nineteen years old!

1449
01:49:43,079 --> 01:49:46,279
- Look at me, Jimmy!
- I'm looking at you, Dave.

1450
01:49:46,280 --> 01:49:47,799
I'm looking at you.

1451
01:49:47,800 --> 01:49:50,559
Why'd you do it?

1452
01:49:50,560 --> 01:49:55,163
Me and my son. Me and Celeste. There's
so many things we gotta make right.

1453
01:49:55,719 --> 01:49:58,639
Make it right now. Start now.
Admit what you did.

1454
01:49:58,640 --> 01:50:01,438
No more lies, no more secrets.

1455
01:50:01,439 --> 01:50:04,614
I wanna go home to Celeste.
I wanna feel Celeste.

1456
01:50:04,840 --> 01:50:09,443
Right after you do your time. I did mine,
you do yours. Admit what you did.

1457
01:50:09,799 --> 01:50:13,039
- The boy...
- One more time about the boy...

1458
01:50:13,040 --> 01:50:15,369
...and I will open you the fuck up.

1459
01:50:20,560 --> 01:50:23,639
I thought I was finished with all this.

1460
01:50:23,640 --> 01:50:27,754
I mean, killing people
and dumping them in the river.

1461
01:50:32,039 --> 01:50:35,839
You admit what you did, Dave,
and I'm gonna let you live.

1462
01:50:35,840 --> 01:50:40,319
Just say it out loud,
and I'll let you breathe.

1463
01:50:40,320 --> 01:50:43,999
Admit what you did,
and I will give you your life.

1464
01:50:43,999 --> 01:50:45,998
Admit what you did, Dave.

1465
01:50:45,999 --> 01:50:48,726
Admit what you did.

1466
01:50:49,800 --> 01:50:53,270
Admit what you did.
Admit what you did.

1467
01:50:53,480 --> 01:50:55,313
I know you can speak.

1468
01:50:57,959 --> 01:51:02,274
So say it. Say you love me.

1469
01:51:04,679 --> 01:51:09,044
Don't look at him, look at me.
Now, you say it. You say you love me.

1470
01:51:15,759 --> 01:51:20,272
- He never does anything without you!
- No, let me go! Stop!

1471
01:51:26,440 --> 01:51:28,159
I'm coming back!

1472
01:51:33,759 --> 01:51:37,158
You love me so much,
you gotta kill my fucking girlfriend, huh?

1473
01:51:37,159 --> 01:51:41,763
Speak, you fucking freak,
or I will fucking kill you!

1474
01:51:41,959 --> 01:51:44,598
Say her name. Say it.

1475
01:51:44,599 --> 01:51:48,479
Say it! Katie!
Say it or you die!

1476
01:51:59,399 --> 01:52:04,003
Kid, you want to point that
toward the floor, okay?

1477
01:52:04,359 --> 01:52:06,342
That's a Sig, right?

1478
01:52:08,199 --> 01:52:10,827
Don't you want to draw it on me?

1479
01:52:11,240 --> 01:52:13,918
No, I don't want to hurt a kid.

1480
01:52:13,919 --> 01:52:17,540
Plus, it looks like somebody else
beat me to it.

1481
01:52:17,639 --> 01:52:21,209
Brendan, man, he fucking punched me.

1482
01:52:21,319 --> 01:52:24,319
- He broke my nose.
- We'll arrest him.

1483
01:52:24,320 --> 01:52:28,519
- Haul his ass to jail if you like.
- I don't want him arrested.

1484
01:52:28,520 --> 01:52:30,552
I want him fucking dead!

1485
01:52:37,239 --> 01:52:41,843
Motherfucker.

1486
01:52:44,519 --> 01:52:47,991
Admit what you did, Dave...

1487
01:52:48,359 --> 01:52:50,438
...and I'll let you live.

1488
01:52:50,439 --> 01:52:54,839
Just say it out loud,
and I'll let you breathe.

1489
01:52:54,840 --> 01:52:57,417
You'll go to prison...

1490
01:52:57,959 --> 01:53:01,358
...but I'll give you your life.
Admit it, Dave.

1491
01:53:01,359 --> 01:53:05,079
Admit what you did. Admit it.

1492
01:53:09,079 --> 01:53:11,161
Yeah.

1493
01:53:12,840 --> 01:53:15,070
Yeah, I did it.

1494
01:53:17,959 --> 01:53:21,877
Why?

1495
01:53:24,159 --> 01:53:28,763
That night in McGill's...

1496
01:53:29,199 --> 01:53:33,802
...she reminded me of a dream I had.

1497
01:53:34,800 --> 01:53:36,485
What dream?

1498
01:53:37,599 --> 01:53:40,524
A dream of youth.

1499
01:53:42,200 --> 01:53:45,274
I don't remember having one.

1500
01:53:47,039 --> 01:53:49,419
So it was the dream?

1501
01:53:50,560 --> 01:53:53,435
The dream, yeah.

1502
01:53:54,039 --> 01:53:58,643
You'd know what I mean
if you'd got in that car instead of me.

1503
01:54:05,520 --> 01:54:09,040
But I didn't get in that car, Dave.

1504
01:54:09,600 --> 01:54:13,069
Hang on. Come here. You did.

1505
01:54:32,960 --> 01:54:35,785
We bury our sins here, Dave.

1506
01:54:38,079 --> 01:54:40,906
We wash them clean.

1507
01:54:42,520 --> 01:54:47,123
- His fucking lips are still moving.
- I got eyes, Val.

1508
01:54:52,800 --> 01:54:55,229
I wasn't ready.

1509
01:55:00,520 --> 01:55:02,105
It's like I said, Dave.

1510
01:55:04,959 --> 01:55:06,992
This part, you do alone.

1511
01:55:49,679 --> 01:55:51,910
Tough night?

1512
01:55:54,120 --> 01:55:56,499
Yeah, me too.

1513
01:55:57,960 --> 01:56:01,430
Saw a bullet with my name on it.

1514
01:56:09,119 --> 01:56:11,201
We got them, Jim.

1515
01:56:14,400 --> 01:56:16,035
Got who?

1516
01:56:16,239 --> 01:56:18,817
Katie's killers. Got them cold.

1517
01:56:22,719 --> 01:56:26,090
Killers, plural.

1518
01:56:26,200 --> 01:56:30,803
Yeah, kids, actually. Ray Harris' son
Ray Jr. and another kid, John O'Shea.

1519
01:56:31,479 --> 01:56:34,354
They just confessed a couple hours ago.

1520
01:56:38,280 --> 01:56:39,915
No doubt?

1521
01:56:40,320 --> 01:56:42,352
None.

1522
01:56:50,880 --> 01:56:52,663
Why?

1523
01:56:53,800 --> 01:56:55,638
They don't know.

1524
01:56:55,639 --> 01:56:58,238
They were playing with a gun,
saw a car coming...

1525
01:56:58,239 --> 01:57:02,843
...one of the kids lies down in the street,
car swerves, clutch kicks out. Katie.

1526
01:57:04,839 --> 01:57:08,719
O'Shea says they just meant to scare her
and the gun went off.

1527
01:57:08,720 --> 01:57:12,159
But she hit him with her door, ran...

1528
01:57:12,160 --> 01:57:16,763
...and they chased her
so she wouldn't tell anyone.

1529
01:57:23,520 --> 01:57:25,750
And the beating they gave her?

1530
01:57:27,719 --> 01:57:29,703
Ray Jr. had a hockey stick.

1531
01:57:32,359 --> 01:57:34,679
All right. Go easy.

1532
01:57:34,680 --> 01:57:36,960
Take a breath.

1533
01:57:37,839 --> 01:57:39,879
Look at me.

1534
01:57:39,880 --> 01:57:42,160
Look at me, Jimmy.

1535
01:57:43,960 --> 01:57:46,358
I got a call from Celeste Boyle.

1536
01:57:46,359 --> 01:57:50,963
She was hysterical. Says Dave's missing,
says you might know where he is.

1537
01:57:51,439 --> 01:57:53,959
We need to talk to him.

1538
01:57:53,960 --> 01:57:58,399
Boston P.D. found the body of a guy
in the woods behind McGill's.

1539
01:57:58,400 --> 01:58:01,275
A body? The body of a guy?

1540
01:58:01,319 --> 01:58:04,598
Yeah, a pedophile with three priors.

1541
01:58:04,599 --> 01:58:07,839
They want to talk to Dave about it.

1542
01:58:07,840 --> 01:58:10,268
So, Jimmy...

1543
01:58:10,720 --> 01:58:13,794
...when was the last time
you saw Dave?

1544
01:58:23,480 --> 01:58:27,297
The last time I saw Dave.

1545
01:58:28,039 --> 01:58:31,858
Yeah. Dave Boyle.

1546
01:58:39,080 --> 01:58:43,683
- Dave Boyle.
- Yeah, Jimmy. Dave Boyle.

1547
01:58:45,800 --> 01:58:50,403
That was 25 years ago, going up
this street in the back of that car.

1548
01:58:59,240 --> 01:59:03,843
Jimmy, what did you do?

1549
01:59:10,879 --> 01:59:14,399
Thanks for finding
my daughter's killers, Sean.

1550
01:59:17,319 --> 01:59:20,294
If only you'd been a little faster.

1551
01:59:27,640 --> 01:59:32,053
Are you gonna send Celeste Boyle
500 a month too?

1552
01:59:37,520 --> 01:59:40,642
Sometimes I think...

1553
01:59:40,960 --> 01:59:44,479
I think all three of us got in that car.

1554
01:59:44,599 --> 01:59:48,838
And all of this is just a dream,
you know?

1555
01:59:48,839 --> 01:59:51,417
A dream, sure.

1556
01:59:52,239 --> 01:59:54,598
In reality...

1557
01:59:54,599 --> 01:59:59,203
...we're still 11-year-old boys
locked in a cellar...

1558
01:59:59,279 --> 02:00:03,544
...imagining what our lives
would have been if we'd escaped.

1559
02:00:10,519 --> 02:00:12,678
Maybe you're right.

1560
02:00:12,679 --> 02:00:15,456
Who the fuck knows?

1561
02:00:42,120 --> 02:00:44,698
Yeah, this is Sean.

1562
02:00:49,879 --> 02:00:52,998
I'm sorry. I need you to know that.

1563
02:00:52,999 --> 02:00:55,726
I pushed you away.

1564
02:00:57,839 --> 02:01:00,715
I'm sorry too.

1565
02:01:01,080 --> 02:01:03,919
Things have been so messed up.

1566
02:01:03,920 --> 02:01:06,993
Loving you, hating you.

1567
02:01:08,519 --> 02:01:10,503
Come home?

1568
02:01:12,759 --> 02:01:15,090
You change the locks or anything?

1569
02:01:15,720 --> 02:01:17,802
No.

1570
02:01:18,320 --> 02:01:22,038
No, everything is just the way you left it.

1571
02:01:22,440 --> 02:01:25,761
- Nora.
- What's that?

1572
02:01:26,319 --> 02:01:30,684
Nora. That's our daughter's name, Sean.

1573
02:01:30,920 --> 02:01:32,759
Nora, huh?

1574
02:01:32,760 --> 02:01:37,363
Well, I like that. Nora.

1575
02:02:05,240 --> 02:02:07,966
I killed Dave.

1576
02:02:08,199 --> 02:02:11,918
I killed him, and I threw him
in the Mystic.

1577
02:02:12,200 --> 02:02:14,430
But I killed the wrong man.

1578
02:02:14,639 --> 02:02:17,366
That's what I've done.

1579
02:02:17,479 --> 02:02:20,305
And I can't undo it.

1580
02:02:20,720 --> 02:02:22,901
Jimmy.

1581
02:02:29,999 --> 02:02:33,370
I wanna feel your heart.

1582
02:02:33,480 --> 02:02:35,065
Last night...

1583
02:02:35,160 --> 02:02:39,318
...when I put the girls to bed,
I told them how big your heart was.

1584
02:02:39,319 --> 02:02:42,438
- I told them how much you loved Katie...
- Annabeth.

1585
02:02:42,439 --> 02:02:44,199
...because you created her.

1586
02:02:44,200 --> 02:02:48,119
And sometimes,
your love for her was so big...

1587
02:02:48,120 --> 02:02:51,918
- ...it felt like your heart would explode...
- Please stop.

1588
02:02:51,919 --> 02:02:55,758
I told them their daddy
loved them that much too.

1589
02:02:55,759 --> 02:02:59,279
That he had four hearts,
and they were all filled up...

1590
02:02:59,280 --> 02:03:03,239
...and aching with a love that meant
we would never have to worry.

1591
02:03:03,240 --> 02:03:07,843
And that their daddy would do
whatever he had to for those he loved.

1592
02:03:09,199 --> 02:03:12,439
And that is never wrong.

1593
02:03:12,440 --> 02:03:17,043
That can never be wrong,
no matter what their daddy had to do.

1594
02:03:18,279 --> 02:03:22,883
And those girls fell asleep at peace.

1595
02:03:30,960 --> 02:03:35,563
You said, "last night". You knew?

1596
02:03:36,320 --> 02:03:38,599
Celeste called, looking for you.

1597
02:03:38,600 --> 02:03:41,958
She was worried something might
happen. She told me about Dave.

1598
02:03:41,959 --> 02:03:44,838
Told me what she told you.
What kind of wife...

1599
02:03:44,839 --> 02:03:48,038
...says that about her husband?
And why'd she run to you?

1600
02:03:48,039 --> 02:03:52,439
- Why didn't you call?
- Because it's like I told the girls.

1601
02:03:52,440 --> 02:03:54,758
Their daddy's a king.

1602
02:03:54,759 --> 02:03:58,998
And a king knows what to do
and does it.

1603
02:03:58,999 --> 02:04:00,679
Even when it's hard.

1604
02:04:00,680 --> 02:04:05,038
And their daddy will do whatever
he has to for those he loves.

1605
02:04:05,039 --> 02:04:08,362
And that's all that matters.

1606
02:04:12,399 --> 02:04:16,079
Because everyone is weak, Jimmy.

1607
02:04:16,080 --> 02:04:18,438
Everyone but us.

1608
02:04:18,439 --> 02:04:20,678
We will never be weak.

1609
02:04:20,679 --> 02:04:23,257
And you...

1610
02:04:23,640 --> 02:04:26,813
You could rule this town.

1611
02:04:29,839 --> 02:04:32,519
And after, Jimmy...

1612
02:04:32,520 --> 02:04:35,318
...let's take the girls down to the parade.

1613
02:04:35,319 --> 02:04:38,591
Katie would have liked that.

1614
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:13,279
Michael!

1615
02:06:13,480 --> 02:06:18,083
Michael! Michael!

1616
02:06:18,759 --> 02:06:23,363
Michael!
