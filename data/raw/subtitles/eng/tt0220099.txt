1
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,792
Now, this might be
The room of any small boy...

2
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,198
but it happens to belong to
a boy named Christopher Robin.

3
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,796
And, like most small boys...

4
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:36,230
Christopher Robin had
toy animals to play with.

5
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:41,036
And together they had
many remarkable adventures...

6
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,116
in an enchanted place...

7
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:46,038
called the Hundred Acre Wood.

8
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,800
But of all
his animal friends...

9
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,514
Christopher Robin's
very best friend...

10
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,632
was a bear
called Winnie the Pooh.

11
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,196
Winnie the Pooh?
Wait halfa darn minute!

12
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,791
It seems to me that most of these
stories are about that silly old bear.

13
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,912
Well, then, Tigger,
who should this story be about?

14
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,998
Well, I happen
to know someone...

15
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:16,591
who's extremely fascinatin', not to
mention handsome and debonair-y.

16
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,109
But the title already says
Winnie the Pooh.

17
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:22,312
Oh, that's easy to fix.

18
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,239
There! Now, that's
a wonderful title.

19
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,636
And speaking of wonderful things--
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!

20
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,959
The wonderful thing about tiggers
is tiggers are wonderful things

21
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,878
Their tops are made out of rubber
their bottoms are made out of springs

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,719
They're bouncy, trouncy, flouncy, pouncy
Fun, fun, fun, fun, fun

23
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,434
But the most wonderful thing
about tiggers is I'm the only one

24
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,233
Tiggers are cuddly fell as
Tiggers are awfully sweet

25
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,033
Everyone el-es is jealous
That's why I repeat and repeat

26
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,754
The wonderful thing about tiggers
is tiggers are marvellous chaps

27
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,519
They're loaded with vim and with vigour
they love to leap in your laps

28
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,518
They're jumpy, bumpy, clumpy, pumpy
Fun, fun, fun, fun, fun

29
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,234
But the most wonderful thing
about tiggers is I'm the only one

30
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,316
I'm the only--

31
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,515
Hello! I'm Tigger.
That's T-l-double-geh-er.

32
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,552
- And that's me. Hoo, hoo, hoo!
- I know.

33
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,150
You've bounced me
lots and lots of times.

34
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,748
Yeah. Fun, ain't it?

35
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:42,112
Say, you want to go bouncin'
with me, on account
of bouncin's what tiggers do the--

36
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,071
eh, best.

37
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,952
- Eww.
- Well...

38
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,709
I would go bouncing
with you, Tigger...

39
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,435
except that I must count
all these honey pots...

40
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,189
to be sure that I have
enough for winter.

41
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,153
Let me get that, please.

42
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,990
- Bother.
- Yech!

43
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,159
What do these Pooh bears like
about this icky, sticky stuff anyway?

44
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,953
Well, no time for goofi n' off.
I've got dawdlin' to do.

45
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,278
Hoo, hoo! T.T.F.N.!
Ta-ta for now! Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!

46
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,111
Oh, d-d-dear, dear.

47
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,037
Hiya, Piglet, old pal!

48
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,799
What say you and I do
a little bouncin' together?

49
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,070
B-B-Bouncing? Oh, my!

50
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,749
I-l haven't enough firewood
to last the winter, and--

51
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,758
Why, sure, you do!
Why, there's lots of firewood.

52
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,916
What's this?
It's lyin' all over the place.

53
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,837
- Whoa! Whoa!
- There. See?

54
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,679
- Now we can go bouncin'.
- B-But...

55
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,553
I would really rather prefer
that my firewood...

56
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:54,150
not have quite so much
chair in it.

57
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,716
Oh. Well, then,
uh, T.T.F.N.!

58
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,400
Gotta be bouncin' along!
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!

59
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,309
Well, hello there!
And good mornin', Mrs Kanga, ma'am!

60
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,000
Well, good morning,
Tigger, dear.

61
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,714
She called me "dear."

62
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,957
Pardon me for askin', but you
wouldn't happen to be interested...

63
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,594
in doin' a bit of bouncin'
with me, would ya?

64
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:22,077
Well, I'm afraid I have just too much
to do this morning, dear.

65
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:27,194
Oh. Well,
if you have to--

66
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:31,359
See ya later. Bye.

67
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,950
Tigger! Tigger!
Tigger.

68
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,832
Oh.

69
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,871
I wonder why nobody
wants to bounce with me.

70
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,596
Oh, well.
What am I talkin' about?

71
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,679
There's plenty of others I haven't even
asked yet. Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!

72
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,034
And so, the others
all came 'round...

73
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,720
to see what they
might do to help.

74
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,752
But the end of Eeyore's house
was merely the beginning...

75
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,155
of a very unfortunate day.

76
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,589
Wow! Look at
the size of it.

77
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,953
Your attention, uh, please.

78
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:29,437
I have officially completed
the plans.

79
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:35,835
- What plans?
- The plans for removing this boulder...

80
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:40,078
and restoring to Eeyore,
uh, his happy home.

81
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,839
No need to bother
on my account.

82
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,475
All we need is a little,
uh, uh, team effort.

83
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,673
Rabbit's Rock Remover!

84
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:56,510
Now, then, Pooh bear,
release the counterweight.

85
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,991
Kanga and Roo...

86
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,830
start depressurizing
the granite extractor.

87
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,633
Piglet? Piglet...

88
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,354
start pulling your own weight
over there.

89
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,789
But l-- I don't weigh anything.

90
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,673
A-- A little more over there.

91
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,870
Yes. That's good.
No, no, no, no, no, no!

92
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,471
Over here. This way. This way.
All right, now--

93
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,876
- Oh, good. I think--
- Bother.

94
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:38,232
- Oh, my.
- Oh!

95
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,750
Well, now, why didn't it work?
Oh, let's see here now.

96
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,998
- The counterweight--
- Perhaps we could use
another helping hand.

97
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,680
Yes. All we really need is--

98
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,913
- Tigger!
- Hello, you blokes!

99
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:57,749
- Anyone up for a little bouncin'?
- No! No!

100
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,633
No bouncing! Look!

101
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:04,309
Just look at all this work
we have to do!

102
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,079
What? Movin' that old thing?
Hoo, hoo!

103
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,237
Not a problem.
All you need is a little bouncin'.

104
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,830
How will b-bouncing
move the rock, T-Tigger?

105
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,235
Tut, tut, tut.
Not now, Piglet.

106
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,955
If maybe we had a little, uh--

107
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,239
Mm-hmm. Right there!

108
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,911
"Bouncing will move this boulder."
It's almost amusing.

109
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,677
Whoo!

110
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,916
Oh! Help!

111
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,035
Whoa!

112
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,396
Wow!

113
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,672
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!
Now that that's outta the way...

114
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,074
who's up for
a little bouncin'?

115
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,716
What is it with you
and bouncing?

116
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:24,719
Just look at
my rock remover.

117
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,035
Everything's ruined...

118
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:31,836
and all you can think
about is bouncing!

119
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,951
But that's what
tiggers do best.

120
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,278
Exactly. Unlike us.

121
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,630
I'm afraid he's right, dear.

122
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,479
Wh-What we're
trying to say is that, uh...

123
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,512
we really can't bounce
like tiggers...

124
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,200
anyway because, uh--

125
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,231
We're not tiggers.

126
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,355
Who needs them
other fell as anyhow?

127
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,311
Mostly I'm happy
and I'm bouncy

128
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:38,194
Because lam
the on liest one

129
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,913
But now all at once
I feel so lonely

130
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:47,589
For someone like me

131
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,915
Someone like me

132
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:53,999
Right now
I'm sort offeerin 'downcy

133
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,317
I'm just about
the loneliest one

134
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,915
And deep in my heart
I'm sort of wishin'

135
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,998
For someone like me

136
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,190
Someone like me

137
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,869
Somebody with springs
and things

138
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,956
Who laughs and sings

139
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,310
And jumps everyday

140
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,355
Somebody who's
fun, fun, fun

141
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,914
Who loves to trounce
and pounce

142
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,396
And bounce
their gloomies away

143
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,158
Howl dream
there is another

144
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:37,955
A double
or a triple of me

145
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,116
To keep him company

146
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,835
But since I'm awake
I feel so lonely

147
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:47,316
Because I know it can't be

148
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,193
It never can be

149
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,791
Bein' that I'm the one
and on liest

150
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,036
Someone

151
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:00,232
Like me

152
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,869
Someone like me

153
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,669
Tigger? Um--

154
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,030
T-Tigger?

155
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,313
Don't be sad, Tigger.

156
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,069
Wh-Why don't you go bouncin'?
That'll cheer you up.

157
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,919
No one to bounce with, Roo boy.

158
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,749
Oh. Well...

159
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,757
what about another tigger?

160
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,633
Another tigger?
Well, that--

161
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,759
No, it's-- it's impossibibble.

162
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:39,429
It's crazy.
I'm the on liest one.

163
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,835
But aren't there other tiggers?

164
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:46,590
I've got a mama. Don't you have
a family somewhere too?

165
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,315
Why, that's ridic-- Uh--
I mean--

166
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,830
Ooh, a family
full of tiggers, you say.

167
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:57,555
Hoo, hoo.
Can you imaginate such a thing?

168
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,989
Why, that'd be more tiggers
than you could stick a shake at.

169
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,634
And we'd all be bouncin'!

170
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,149
Bouncin' morning, noon
and nighty-night!

171
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:09,034
- Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!
- But I could still bounce
with ya, right, Tigger?

172
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:13,312
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!
My very own tigger family!

173
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:18,957
Oh-ho. You wish to
find your family.

174
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:22,550
A most noble quest, indeed.

175
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,990
There we are.
Help yourself to the cream and sugar.

176
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,989
The search for
Familius Genus Tiggeris.

177
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:35,795
That is Latin, I believe.
Or is it, uh, Greek?

178
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:40,118
Speaking of family,
why, my very own family portraits...

179
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,276
hang right over there...

180
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,597
a collection I've gathered
throughout the years.

181
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:49,679
Notice the interesting twists and turns
of its many branches...

182
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,439
stretching out
across the ages.

183
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,870
It all comes from having
strong roots, you know...

184
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,355
and plenty of time to grow.

185
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,517
In fact, I do believe that
the very seed of my family...

186
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:05,110
began to germinate as far back
as the 1 4th century...

187
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:08,152
when a great-great-great
grand-uncle of mine...

188
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:11,909
went out on a limb and proclaimed
his blossoming love...

189
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,837
for a blooming young maid.

190
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,270
As their love blossomed,
they eventually...

191
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:21,916
were blessed with
nine fine young saplings.

192
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,315
Never a bough did break--

193
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:32,669
Now, my dear boy, are you quite
all right? Perhaps some more tea.

194
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,439
Anyway, if I may go
out on a limb here...

195
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:38,313
I would first and foremost
suggest for Tigger...

196
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:42,274
that to find one's family,
one must first look up...

197
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,595
one's family tree.

198
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,951
Oh, it does bring to mind
a distant nephew of mine.

199
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:51,675
An odd sort of fellow. He became
a sailor and fell in with a member...

200
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,916
- of the feline persuasion.
- My...

201
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:57,316
family tree?

202
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,398
My family tree!
Why didn't I think of thinkin' of that?

203
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:04,718
So long, beak lips! Thanks for the tip!
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!

204
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,149
Hoo, hoo, hoo!

205
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:11,114
I say.
Was it something I said?

206
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,713
And so began
Tigger's grand search...

207
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,195
for his family tree.

208
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,079
He searched high.

209
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,316
He searched low.

210
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,352
He searched near...

211
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,835
and he searched far.

212
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,237
Yoo-hoo!

213
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,715
Family! Family!

214
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,798
Hello!

215
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,992
But Tigger,
how are you gonna know...

216
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,395
which tree is your family tree?

217
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:49,159
Why, that's obvious, Roo boy.

218
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:52,636
My tigger family tree
has got to be the biggest...

219
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:56,469
hugest and most gigantical tree
in the entire Hundred Acre Woodses...

220
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,592
on account of all the enormous
numerical numerous numbers of...

221
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,188
tigger family members
that'll be on it.

222
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,596
And besides and furthermore,
it'll be all stripedy...

223
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,995
just like yours truly.
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!

224
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,792
The only question is...

225
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,196
where could
my family tree be?

226
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,436
There! Good as new.

227
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,519
Or maybe even better,
if I do say so myself.

228
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,600
Could be a bit drafty.

229
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,077
Might leak some.

230
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,549
Sort of lopsided.

231
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,670
Kind of cramped.

232
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,315
Otherwise, a dream house.

233
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,397
Hiya, donkey boy!

234
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,351
Hiya, donkey boy!

235
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,677
- Tigger.
- Tigger!
- Tigger?

236
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,155
Back to his bouncy old self.

237
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:02,512
Oh, is this perhaps
a tigger family tree up there?

238
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:07,191
Were you asking us
to bounce with you? Because,
you see, we would be glad to--

239
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,278
Hello, tigger family!

240
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:14,075
Hello!

241
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,317
- Uh, no, not this one. Hello!
- Hello!

242
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,193
- Other tiggers, come out,
come out, wherever you are!
- Other tiggers!

243
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,709
- Come out, come out,
wherever you are!
- And aren't! Et cetera!

244
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:26,435
- Hello! Tigger's family!
- Hello! Tigger's family!

245
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,269
- Where are you?
- Pooh bear?
I didn't know Tigger had a family.

246
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,710
Yes. Only it appears...

247
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,671
that he has lost them.

248
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,872
Seemed to be lookin' for 'em.

249
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,357
Uh, was that something
we were supposed to be doing too?

250
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:49,313
Why, I believe
it must be, Piglet.

251
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,558
I quite often remember to forget
these sorts of things.

252
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,150
Oh, no, no.

253
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,475
Aren't you coming, Rabbit?

254
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,628
Huh? To look
for more tiggers?

255
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,957
As if one wasn't bad enough.
No, no! No!

256
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,389
I have too many
winter preparations to make.

257
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,672
And-- And if you three had any sense,
you'd be doing the same.

258
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,556
Come on.

259
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,711
- Hello! Hello!
- Hello!

260
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:32,469
- Tiggers! Come out, come out,
wherever you aren't!
- Tiggers!

261
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:36,593
- Hello! Tiggers!
-Just where aren't
those tiggers anyway?

262
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,075
We looked every
which and where...

263
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,270
not to mention
right over there...

264
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,631
and not a single
stripedy tree in sight.

265
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:50,069
Maybe I've been going about this
all the wrong way upside down.

266
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,636
Maybe what I need to do
is find some sort of clue...

267
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,557
as to where are
their whereabouts.

268
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,910
What kind of clue?

269
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:02,397
Maybe in here. Some thingamabob
or an heir-i-loom or something.

270
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:07,196
Oh! Maybe this
belonged to my uncle!

271
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,436
Whatever.
And just think...

272
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,154
if there are other tiggers,
we could all bounce...

273
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,794
the Whoop-de-Dooper, Loop-de-Looper,
Ali-Ooper Bounce!

274
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,911
'Cause it's the bounce
that tiggers do best.

275
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:21,238
The Whoop-de-w--
What kind of bounce?

276
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,954
Oh, you know, that bounce I bounc-ed
when I bounced that big rock...

277
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,755
the most hardest bounce
of them all that only
the very bestest bouncers can bounce.

278
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:31,998
- You know.
- Only the very bestest bouncers...

279
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,873
can bounce it.

280
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,834
Oh! Could my auntie
have made this for me?

281
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,110
I could bounce it.

282
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,800
It looks like she made a pair.

283
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:50,273
If you could teach me the Whoopy
Super-Duper Bounce, then I could--

284
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,437
Teach ya the W-D-double-L-A-O-B?

285
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,793
What? That's ridickerous!
Why, it-- it's a--

286
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,798
It's a very powerful bounce,
and it's only...

287
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,990
for professional bouncers.

288
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,794
But I'm a real good bouncer.

289
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,957
Hoo, hoo, hoo.
No offence there, Roo boy...

290
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,311
but I think you're a little
on the smallish side of tiny...

291
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,351
and kinda lackin'
in perpendicaler.

292
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:19,268
I-l could do
the Whooper Dooper, uh--

293
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:23,712
The Looper Dooper, uh--
If you teach me.

294
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,990
Oh, you can't bounce the bounce...

295
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:29,476
if you can't even pronounce
the bounce.

296
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,716
Repeat after Tigger.

297
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:36,311
The Whoop-de-Dooper
Loop-de-Looper, Ali-Ooper Bounce

298
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:39,432
The Whoop-de-Dooper
Loop-de-Looper, Ali-Ooper Bounce

299
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:42,518
It's got the zip that makes you flip
and that's what really counts

300
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,916
In the Whoop-de-Dooper
Loop-de-Looper, Ali-Ooper Bounce

301
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:49,749
Now, half this bounce
is 90 percent mental.

302
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,348
If you calculate
the specific tiggerjectory...

303
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,311
of your stripecelleration
dicipherus...

304
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:58,035
by the square boot of your rebounce,
your vertical situituation indicator...

305
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,391
and your stripersonic springnertia
should ric-a-ticochet...

306
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,397
your hydranific
fu-silly-age...

307
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,318
into an accelerometric de-orbit!

308
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:10,319
- Any questions?
- When do I get to learn
the Whooping Looper Whooper--

309
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:13,512
I mean, the Looper
Dooper Whooper, uh--

310
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:16,632
The Whoop-de-Dooper
Loop-de-Looper, Ali-Ooper Bounce

311
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,832
The Whoop-de-Dooper
Loop-de-Looper, Ali-Ooper Bounce

312
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:23,270
The more you try, the more you fly
and that's what really counts

313
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,551
In the Whoop-de-Dooper
Loop-de-Looper, Ali-Ooper Bounce

314
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:30,389
Now, you swing your legs up high,
and you twist your tail in tight.

315
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,750
Wind up all your springs...

316
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,351
and with your eyes
situated straight ahead...

317
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,675
you let it all loose.

318
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,268
Um, is this right?

319
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,472
It's best when done by tiggers
'cause ourtiggerific figgers

320
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,672
Are filled with vim sand vigours
and that's the thing that triggers

321
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,758
The Whoop-de-Dooper
Loop-de-Looper, Ali-Ooper Bounce

322
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:55,031
The Whoop-de-Dooper
Loop-de-Looper, Ali-Ooper Bounce

323
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:58,311
- The more you try, the more you fly
and that's what really counts
- Right.

324
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,159
It activates, it elevates
accelerates and more

325
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,636
- Whee!
- You're bouncing off the ceiling
like you never did before

326
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,432
- The Whoop-de-Dooper
- Whoop-de-Dooper

327
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,039
- Loop-de-Looper
- Loop-de-Looper

328
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,913
Ali-Ooper

329
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:14,874
Bounce
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!

330
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,878
Wow! Now me! Now me!

331
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,516
Tut, tut, tut!
Hoo, hoo, hoo. Wait a minute.

332
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,393
We haven't gone over
all the safety rules and regularations.

333
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,796
- Aw!
- Rule number one:
Always bounce in a well-lit area.

334
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:43,198
Rule number the-next-one:
Never bounce near an open flame.

335
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:46,232
Rule three: Never bounce right
after eatin', or you'll get tail cramps.

336
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:49,716
- First you-- And then you--
- Rule number four:
Do not forget rule number--

337
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,274
And then you let it
all loose with a--

338
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,152
Rule number--

339
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:57,033
Whoo!

340
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,115
Whoa!

341
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,555
I think you let it
a little too loose.

342
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,990
Maybe another lesson?

343
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:22,074
I could--

344
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,397
What is this doohickey?

345
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,750
Why, that's no doohickey.

346
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,599
It's a thingamabob.
Been in the family for generations.

347
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,110
And I never even knew
I had a doo-- Hoo, hoo, hoo!

348
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,438
This is the exact thingamabob
I was lookin' for.

349
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,437
And it must have a picture...

350
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,199
of my tigger family inside it.

351
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,198
- Oh, boy!
- Oh! I can't wait.

352
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,515
I'll bet I got
my mother's eyes...

353
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,790
and my father's tail and-and--

354
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,718
one of my sister's chins,
of course.

355
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,756
My grand pappy's stripes.

356
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:12,471
It's kind of, sort of--

357
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:18,472
Empty.
Completely tiggerless.

358
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:22,593
How am I supposed to find
my family now?

359
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:30,432
M-Maybe there's another way
to reach 'em.

360
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,357
Another way?

361
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:40,358
A letter!
Why don't you write 'em a letter?

362
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,755
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!

363
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,593
- Hello!
- Hello?
- Hello out there.

364
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,517
Hello! Tigger's family?

365
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,074
Tigger's family tree.

366
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,112
Hello!

367
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,754
Uh, how will we know
a tigger family member...

368
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,757
when we see one?

369
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,917
I suspect that he, or she...

370
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:06,272
would be rather more bouncy
than usual, Piglet.

371
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,756
I found 'em--
Tigger's family.

372
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:13,077
- Really?
- Oh! Where, Eeyore?

373
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:19,909
Here they are, bouncin' like anything,
stripes and all.

374
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,670
No need to thank me.

375
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,155
Do these
particular tiggers seem...

376
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:32,875
rather strange to you, Piglet?

377
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,197
Y-Y-Yes, and rather f-fierce.

378
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:41,678
Still, I suppose you
never can tell with tiggers.

379
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:45,873
Pardon me, Mr--
or Mrs-- Tigger...

380
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,596
but could you perhaps accompany me
back to Tigger's house?

381
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,790
He misses you
very much, you see.

382
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:55,388
And he--
Oh, bother.

383
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:00,197
Uh-- Uh, hello,
tigger family member.

384
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:04,393
Uh, uh, I was wondering--
That is, i-i-ifyou're not too busy--

385
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,590
Oh! Whoa!

386
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,597
D-D-Dear.

387
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,473
Sinkin'? Figures.

388
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,114
If I could just have a moment?

389
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,390
But-But please come back!

390
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:26,275
We really need your help.
It would just take a minute. Oh, bother.

391
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,631
Nice tigger.
Ooh, hoo!

392
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:35,312
I-l don't remember tiggers being
quite this s-slippery, do you, Pooh?

393
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,237
Well, now that
I think of it...

394
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:42,718
I don't remember a tigger making quite
that sort of sound either.

395
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:46,833
- Piglet.
- Yes, Pooh bear?

396
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:51,238
I don't think these are
the right sort of tiggers after all.

397
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:55,592
Not that anyone
will miss me.

398
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,477
Let me see now.

399
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:03,355
"Dear T-l-double-geh-ers. Tiggers.

400
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,438
Greetin's and salivatin's!

401
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:10,917
Please drop by
any old time...

402
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,031
on account of my house...

403
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:17,039
is your house,
and vice-y verse-y.

404
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,628
Love, Tigger."

405
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,389
Hoo, hoo.
There! That oughta do it!

406
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:42,277
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!
Now there's nothin' to do...

407
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,436
but wait.

408
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,909
- Hello, Tigger's family.
- Hello!
- Hello.

409
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:54,272
- Tigger's family?
- Are you out there?
- Anybody out there?

410
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,268
Why, if my tummy
is not mistaken...

411
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,277
this particular family tree...

412
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,868
is a bee sort
of family tree.

413
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,231
And where there are bees...

414
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,191
there's honey.

415
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,630
Um, I think there may be
something moving...

416
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,149
in this tree.

417
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,077
D-Do you think
it could be...

418
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:23,397
Tigger's family up there,
Pooh bear?

419
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,910
I suppose there's only
one way to find out, Piglet.

420
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,750
Just as my tummy suspected.

421
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,596
Ow!

422
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,633
Bother. If only these bees
were a bit less...

423
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:57,035
busy.

424
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:01,472
Perhaps if I hummed
a soothing sort of song...

425
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,750
Like such:

426
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,191
Go to sleep

427
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:10,517
Shh, quiet
lf you're a bee

428
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,950
A lullaby

429
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,430
Lullabee, lullabee

430
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:23,313
Honey bees in the tree

431
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,994
Rest your wings

432
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,999
Till the morning light

433
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:34,510
Lullabee, lullabee

434
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,349
Honey bees in the tree

435
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,870
Your honey

436
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,151
Is safe tonight

437
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:48,511
Just dream to the tune

438
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,110
I 'am singing

439
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,037
Time to stop

440
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:57,072
All that buzzing and

441
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,475
Stinging
Mm, ouch.

442
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,910
Lullabee, lullabee

443
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:06,749
Honey bees in the tree

444
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,316
All I want is a smackrel

445
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,908
Or two

446
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,758
Or three

447
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,997
Don't sleep lightly

448
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:21,635
Sleep very tightly

449
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,036
Happy slumbers

450
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,879
To you

451
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,797
Shh.

452
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:42,157
Pooh bear's been up in that tree
an awful long time, don't you think?

453
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:46,671
Most likely he's stuck.
Been known to happen.

454
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,677
Oh, d-dear!

455
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:53,191
Then l-- I'd better climb up
and-and see if he's all right.

456
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,397
Uh, Pooh bear.

457
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,398
- Uh, a-a-are you stuck?
- Oh!

458
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,837
Oh, bother.

459
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:10,554
Uh, Pooh bear?

460
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:18,269
- Oh! Piglet.
- Yes, Pooh?

461
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,356
- I have come to the conclusion that--
- Whoa!

462
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:26,032
that these bees are definitely not
the right sort of tiggers!

463
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,515
It doesn't look good.

464
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,839
Bees! Run!

465
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:06,758
At last, the day
had come to an end...

466
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,156
as days often will.

467
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:14,558
And what had begun
as a very exciting idea...

468
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:17,956
had changed to
a rather discouraging one.

469
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,349
Tigger?
Uh, I gotta go home now.

470
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,391
Mama will be worried about me.

471
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,875
Tigger?

472
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,151
Oh, what, am I kiddin' myself?

473
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:37,316
They're not comin'...

474
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,908
'cause I might
as well face it--

475
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,793
there aren't any other tiggers.

476
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,908
I guess that means
this silly old thing's...

477
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,759
just gonna stay empty for...

478
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,553
all of forever.

479
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:57,116
But isn't that the wonderful thing
about tiggers...

480
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:00,038
being the only one?

481
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,435
You betcha, Roo boy.

482
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:06,269
Oh, the most wonderful thing
about tiggers is I'm

483
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,960
The very only

484
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:13,471
Last, lonely, single...

485
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,195
s-s-s-solitary...

486
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:19,515
one.

487
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,357
First, l--

488
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,596
And just so--

489
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,915
And then l--

490
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:35,431
Like this. And then
a little twist, like such.

491
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,432
And then I let it
all loose with a--

492
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,557
Oh! Whatever are
you doing, Roo, dear?

493
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:59,194
I'm practising
the Whoop-de-Doop-Tee Bounce.

494
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:02,357
Maybe if I do it
really good for Tigger...

495
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,358
he wouldn't miss
not having a family so much.

496
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:08,233
But I can't bounce it yet.

497
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:12,353
Well, I'm sure you'll be able
to do it in time, dear.

498
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:16,678
But Tigger seems awful lonely,
don't you think, Mama?

499
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:20,588
I suppose he might be
every now and again.

500
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,631
- Mama?
- Yes, dear?

501
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:25,479
I wish I had
a big brother like Tigger.

502
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,950
Now, why wish that...

503
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,548
when you have a Tigger
like Tigger?

504
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,636
'Cause then I'd be
his little brother...

505
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,672
and he'd be just like
one of our family.

506
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,473
- Wouldn't that be great?
- But, Roo, dear...

507
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,433
Tigger is one of our family.

508
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:47,236
And as long as we care for him,
he always will be.

509
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:00,480
Sweet dreams, Roo, dear.

510
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:14,799
I still wish I could do something
to make him feel better.

511
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,158
I say, young Roo,
if you suggest that a letter...

512
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,635
would bring cheer
to our friend Tigger...

513
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:26,958
then we shall,
by all means, write one!

514
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,675
Now, uh, what sort of letter
is this to be?

515
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,997
It's by us from them to him.

516
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:38,076
By which from what to whom?

517
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,794
From Tigger's family to Tigger.

518
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:43,878
Ah, yes!

519
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,994
"Dear Tigger,
Just a note to say--"

520
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:53,989
Uh, "just a note to say"?
What shall it say?

521
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,150
Well, uh...

522
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,589
I suppose it might say...

523
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,678
um, "dress warmly"?

524
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,394
Oh, oh, I see.

525
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,431
Excellent advice.

526
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,915
Oh, Owl?

527
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,430
Perhaps-- "Eat well"?

528
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,516
Good point, Pooh bear.

529
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,871
"Stay safe and sound"?

530
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,879
Oh, a very good idea, Piglet.

531
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,872
"Keep smilin'."

532
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,271
"We're always there for you."

533
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,470
"Wishing you all the best.

534
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:35,558
Signed, Your Family."

535
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,989
- There.
- Won't Tigger be pleased?

536
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:40,680
- Yes, yes, how wonderful for Tigger.
- What a splendid idea.

537
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,190
- Nice, everybody.
- Yes, marvellous work, everyone.

538
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,949
And so, the next morning--

539
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,191
Hello, everybody!

540
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,515
Pooh boy!
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!

541
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,756
Pigilet!

542
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:04,314
Kanga! Kanga!
Roo! Roo! Roo!

543
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:07,591
Hoo, hoo, hoo!
Eeyore! Eeyore, old buddy!

544
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:11,759
Look at what I got. A letter, a letter
for me! That's who. Hoo, hoo, hoo!

545
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:15,236
T-l-double-geh-er spells Tigger!

546
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:18,557
I, uh, wonder
who it might be from.

547
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,955
From my very own family!
I knew I had one.

548
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:24,311
A great big family!
Full of uncles and aunties...

549
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:27,716
and-and grand-tiggers
and second-cousin tiggers!

550
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,593
And they're all just like me.
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo.

551
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:34,110
Just imaginate it.
Hundreds of thousands of tiggers!

552
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:39,075
All bouncin' around up there
in our huge gigantical family tree!

553
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:45,113
There's momsey tiggers
and popsey tiggers

554
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,879
And tiggers In ever knew

555
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,594
Like sister tiggers
and brother tiggers

556
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,517
And cousin tiggers too

557
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:55,950
There's grandma tiggers and
grandpa tiggers as you can plainly see

558
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:59,595
When we're all together
it's ajumpin 'jamboree

559
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:02,837
'Round, 'round my family tree
I look like them and they look like me

560
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,474
'Round, 'round my family tree
We're a happy family

561
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:09,434
There's huge slews of nephew tiggers
Uncle tiggers by the ton

562
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,757
There's whippersnappin 'grandpappy
tiggers and grandma tiggers are fun

563
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:16,190
There's skinny, little tiny
little thin, little tiggers
Roly-poly tiggers too

564
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,869
But we're all relations and
we're quite a mighty crew

565
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,072
'Round, 'round my family tree
I look like them and they look like me

566
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,351
- 'Round, 'round my family tree
We're a happy family
- The Amazing Flying Tiggers!

567
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:30,393
'Round my family tree
We're a happy family

568
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:33,796
The firstest-most roots
of my family tree

569
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,673
Reach way backin history

570
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,758
To the braverest, fiercerest
noblerest tiggers

571
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:42,678
You'd ever care to see

572
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,872
The heroicest figgers
of my ancestor tiggers

573
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,912
Has always been
hailed and cheered

574
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,838
And the sculpturous grace
of our tiggerous faces

575
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:54,838
Is why we're all revered

576
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:58,077
There were warrior tiggers
Explorier tiggers

577
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,998
And tiggers of worldly acclaim

578
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:04,635
There were glorious
fantazmagorious tiggers

579
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:07,513
With prizes and fortunes and fame

580
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:10,757
There's the glamorous branch
and the amorous branch

581
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,190
Of our fabulous family tree

582
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,709
And when we sing together

583
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:21,152
We're in perfect harmony

584
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,716
'Round and 'round
my family tree

585
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:28,833
I look like them

'Round and 'round
my family tree

00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:38,750
We're a happy family
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo.

588
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:43,351
There's momsey tiggers

00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:46,916
And tiggers In ever knew
Hoo, hoo.

And grandma tiggers too

592
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:58,792
And when we tiggers
all get together

593
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:02,196
We really have a ball

594
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:06,199
The bounciest, trounciest
flounciest, pounciest

595
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,436
Most tiggerifigest

596
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,870
Family reunion of all

597
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:17,474
Everybody bounce! You know
how to do it! Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!

598
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:24,832
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo. And-- I'm especially
excited about this part--

599
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,235
they miss me somethin' awful!

600
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:31,399
And they're comin' to see me tomorrow!
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!

601
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,596
T-T-Tomorrow?

602
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:40,196
- Uh-oh.
- Oh, Tigger, I can't wait to meet them.

603
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:43,392
Now, w-w-w-where did it
say that exactly?

604
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:46,114
Exackatackly nowhere, per se...

605
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:51,553
'cause with us tiggers,
you got to read betwixt the lines.

606
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:55,719
I'm gonna see my whole family! 'Cause
my whole family is all comin' to see...

607
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:58,149
Little old
you-know-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

608
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,635
But the most wonderful thing
about tiggers is

609
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:04,196
I'm not the only one
I'm not the only one

610
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,390
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!

611
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,518
Now, Tigger was
so enormously excited...

612
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:15,237
that his friends couldn't help
but feel, well, a bit concerned.

613
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,237
Tigger?

614
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,116
Tigger?

615
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:31,110
- Tigger?
- Oh, hiya, Roo.

616
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,435
What are ya doin', Tigger?

617
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:36,518
Why, I'm buildin'
a family room on to my house!

618
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:39,393
So my family will
have plenty of room!

619
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:48,680
They got to live somewheres
after the big family reunitin' party.
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!

620
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,597
- Party?
- Why, sure!

621
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:54,713
Boy, it's gonna be great.
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!

622
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:57,991
It's all right in my letter.

623
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,630
Speakin' of which, you wanna hear
me read it once or thrice again?

624
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:09,117
- Uh, Tigger--
- "Dear--" They call me "dear."

625
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:11,117
It's embarrassin', ain't it,

626
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:15,199
the way us tiggers go oozin' oodles
and doodles of affection?

627
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:18,437
- Yeah, but--
- "Dear Tigger--" Ya see that?

628
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:22,314
Us tiggers always call us tiggers
by their firstest names.

629
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:25,000
"Dress warmly."
They're worried sick about me.

630
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:27,509
"Eat well. Keep smilin'.

631
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:29,437
Stay safe and sound."

632
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:32,028
And here is
the best part of all.

633
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:35,516
"We're always there forya."

634
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:39,679
Isn't this the all-time greatest?

635
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:43,076
Yeah, the greatest.

636
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:48,997
I was gonna tell him,
but I couldn't.

637
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:53,079
Pooh, do you think you could?

638
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:56,715
Why, certainly, Roo.

639
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,751
Could what?

640
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:02,395
Tell him, uh,
about the letter?

641
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:05,273
Why, certainly.

642
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,310
Could that be them already?

643
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:19,079
Tiggers are usually
fashion bubbly late.

644
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:26,959
Welcome, dear brothers,
to the house of Tigger!

645
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:29,389
Oh. Hiya, buddy bear.

646
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:32,796
You're just in time to help me
finish up with the finishin' up.

647
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:35,593
- Hold these here
while I put those there.
- Uh, Tigger...

648
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:40,316
there is a very important matter
which I must discuss.

649
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:45,389
You're right, Pooh boy! I could use
another balloon or two dozen.

650
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,670
Um, Tigger?

651
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:51,759
Hmm. Something
isn't right here.

652
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:57,795
Much better. Now, what'd you want to
talk about, Pooh boy?

653
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,592
Pooh?

654
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,870
Perhaps I'll need
a bit of help.

655
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,193
Tigger was so very excited...

656
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,629
and had so
very many things to do...

657
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:12,548
he heard very little
of what anyone else was saying.

658
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,877
But as it so happened...

659
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,878
none of his friends
had the heart to tell Tigger...

660
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,275
very much of anything anyway.

661
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:26,916
Not like he won't
find out for himself...

662
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,837
sooner or later.

663
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:32,839
Oh, poor dear.
He'll be so disappointed.

664
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,997
- Oh, d-d-dear.
- Indeed.

665
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:38,839
Oh, what have we done?

666
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:41,520
Oh, perhaps his family will come...

667
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:44,473
and everything will be fine.

668
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,636
That's it!

669
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:53,437
There!
A veritable work of art.

670
00:43:55,720 --> 00:44:00,669
Ah. And just how will this
cheer up Tigger?

671
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,918
Uh, well, uh,
the stripes look okay.

672
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:08,749
But what we have to do
is act real tiggery.

673
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,713
We gotta do a lot of bouncing...

674
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:13,831
and say a lot of tigger stuff.

675
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:18,033
Yes, such as,
"Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!"

676
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,991
"Absoposilutely."

677
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:22,680
That's kinda sorta like--

678
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,917
Like Tigger, but, um--

679
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:29,749
How to be a tigger
How to be a tigger

680
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:32,713
How to be a tigger
is up to you

681
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:34,876
Ah!
You've got to look like a tigger

682
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,913
-And-And sound like a tigger
-And act like a tigger too

683
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,793
If we paint black stripes
on our underwear

684
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,831
And glue on whiskers too

685
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:47,555
We're bound to appear
far more as tiggers do

686
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:49,716
Ha, ha. Unquestionably.

687
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:54,789
Maybe we could all say T. T.F.N.
and shout hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo

688
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:59,038
We all might sound
a lot more tiggerish too
You think?

689
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:02,470
And that is how to be a tigger
How to be a tigger

690
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:04,716
How to be a tigger
is up to you

691
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:07,195
You've got to look like a tigger
and sound like a tigger

692
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:10,756
And act like a tigger too

693
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:14,077
If we break things up
and knock things down

694
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:16,316
And leave the place a mess

695
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:21,116
That's the thing
that Tigger does the best
I oughta know.

696
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:23,959
And if I don't eat honey
from the honey pot

697
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:26,514
Ol' Tigger will plainly see

698
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:31,270
I must be another tigger
because I couldn't possibly be me

699
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:34,278
And that is how to be a tigger
How to be a tigger

700
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,630
How to be a tigger
is up to you

701
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:39,558
You've got to look like a tigger
and sound like a tigger

702
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:42,069
And act like a tigger--

703
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:44,998
Um, also.

704
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:50,399
Oh! Thank goodness I found you all here.
There's a terrible storm headed for--

705
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,835
What on earth are you doing?
Stripes? Springs?

706
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:59,872
Have you lost your minds?
You should be covering the windows!

707
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,072
Counting your supplies!
Gathering firewood!

708
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:06,158
Winter is here,
and-and you aren't even ready.

709
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:08,919
What are you doing
wasting your time with--

710
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:11,190
What am I doing
wasting my time?

711
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:13,959
I've got serious work to do!

712
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:18,551
At least I haven't lost sight
of what's really important.

713
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:24,192
Well, l-l-l really didn't
have enough time...

714
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:26,436
to gather any firewood.

715
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:29,438
I am down to this...

716
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:32,028
Last lonely honey pot.

717
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:36,557
Well, come to think of it, uh...

718
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:40,355
we don't really look or act
very much like tiggers.

719
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:44,553
Thought I was pretty convincing.

720
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:47,911
Wait! Wait! We gotta do it!
We have to do it!

721
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:50,429
Think how sad
Tigger's gonna feel.

722
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:56,078
Oh, but we don't really
know how to be a tigger.

723
00:46:56,200 --> 00:47:00,352
Yeah, we do. Um--

724
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:02,471
If we could all be happy

725
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:05,910
Full of friendliness and cheer

726
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:10,795
He'll surely see
we are his family

727
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:15,038
Ah!
We're filled with joy and laughter

728
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:18,197
And the happiness he starts

729
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:20,993
Candlelit from the bottom

730
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:24,999
Of our hearts

731
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:30,476
And that is how to be a tigger
How to be a tigger

732
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:34,479
How to be a tigger is up to you
you've got to be like a tigger

733
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:38,070
-Full of glee like a tigger with a happy
-Hoo, hoo, hoo

734
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:39,997
- How to be a tigger
- How to be a tigger

735
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:42,475
How to be a tigger
is up to you

736
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:45,353
You've got to be like a tigger
full of glee like a tigger

737
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:48,472
With a happy
hoo, hoo, hoo

738
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:52,718
Hoo, hoo

739
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:09,352
I wonder where they could be.

740
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:12,199
What if they got
the wrong directions?

741
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:15,756
What if they strayed
off the beaten path?

742
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:19,668
What if they're out there
hopelessly lost?

743
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:23,713
Clutched in the cruel grasp
of winter?

744
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:28,391
Hold on, tiggers!
I'm comin' to get ya!

745
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:31,034
Surprise!

746
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,719
Is it-- Is it--

747
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:38,115
Is it really you...

748
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:42,153
my very own
one and only family?

749
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:43,872
- Yep, yep!
- Come in, come in!

750
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,797
There's a lot of
catching' uppin' we gotta do.

751
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:48,309
We haven't seen each other in--

752
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:51,238
We haven't seen each other!

753
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:55,592
Ooh! Ooh.

754
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:58,951
Um, gee, it's, um, nice...

755
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:02,595
to have all us tiggers
gettin' together like this.

756
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,870
- Huh?
- Oh, yes, yes.
- Yes.

757
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,629
- Sure.
- It certainly is.

758
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:12,196
What am l--
Where the heck are my mannerisms?

759
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:15,710
Uh, uh, r-r-refreshin'
refreshyments for all.

760
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:17,637
Hoo, hoo.
Comin' right up. Hoo, hoo.

761
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:20,513
Help yourself. Don't be--
Don't be shy. There you go.

762
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:22,710
Take two, you're small.
I mean, they're small.

763
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:26,469
- I mean, oh, here, have another. A lot
of vitamins and minimals after all.
- Bother.

764
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:30,752
Oh, um, my, what-- what--
what a nice home you have.

765
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,440
Yes, and what
lovely decorations.

766
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:38,156
So bouncety
and, uh, stripedy.

767
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:42,319
- Nice weather.
- Party flavour?

768
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:46,513
Now this party's really startin'
to pick up. Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!

769
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:50,758
- So, what you been up to, cousin?
- I-l-l-- I've been, uh--

770
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:57,358
Bouncin'! Bouncin', bouncin',
mornin' and noon, and noon to night.

771
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:00,790
Why, that's what I've
been doin' too!

772
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:02,797
It must run in the family.

773
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:06,151
Hey, who's up for some
family-type fun and games?

774
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:09,078
You look like
a fun-lovin' type offella.

775
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:13,832
I got a great party-type,
family-type game we can play.

776
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:17,350
How about pin the tail
on the do--

777
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:23,349
It looks like
you already been playin' it.

778
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:25,994
- Whew!
- I know.

779
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:30,830
Let's all do what tiggers do best.
That would be bouncin', of course.

780
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:33,315
- Oh, yes, what a lovely idea.
- Oh, of course, bouncin' again.

781
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:37,797
- Yeah!
- Let the bouncin' begin!

782
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:43,034
Yeah!

783
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:45,993
Bounce. Bounce.

784
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,879
Oops.

785
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:55,152
I do enjoy bouncing.

786
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:58,909
- Bounce, bounce.
- Don't bounce too high now, Roo.

787
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:01,600
Tigger. Tigger, dear.

788
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:07,590
You certainly have
a wonderful family, Tigger.

789
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:11,679
Wait a second! We gotta bounce
the Whoop-de-Dooper...

790
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:15,110
Loop-de-Looper, Ali-Ooper Bounce!

791
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:17,356
What a tiggerific idea!

792
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:21,714
Guests first.

793
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:24,957
You gotta swing your legs up high.

794
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:27,514
And you twist your tail in tight.

795
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:30,074
You wind up all your springs...

796
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:33,237
and with your eyes,
fix them straight ahead...

797
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:35,476
you let it all loose and go...

798
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:37,716
"Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!"

799
00:51:55,160 --> 00:52:00,712
Roo! What are you doin'
impersonizin' a tigger?

800
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:07,157
Piglet?

801
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:10,795
Kanga. Owl.

802
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:13,832
- Eeyore!
- Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo.

803
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:19,759
We only wanted to help, Tigger.

804
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:23,993
Oh. Oh.

805
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:27,908
Now I understand.
It was all a big joke.

806
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:33,996
Well, that's all right...

807
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:36,236
'cause somewhere out there...

808
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:40,717
there's a tigger family tree
full of my real tigger family.

809
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:42,956
I've got a letter to prove it.

810
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:48,990
And I'm gonna find 'em, so...

811
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:51,236
T.T.F.E.

812
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:54,636
Ta-ta forever!

813
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:31,555
Poor Tigger,
all alone in the cold.

814
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:35,638
He must be very sad...

815
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:38,069
and perhaps lost.

816
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:40,760
And maybe even a bit...

817
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:45,316
hungry.

818
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:47,510
Bother.

819
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:54,630
Pooh, you gotta
help me find Tigger.

820
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:56,990
It's all my fault.

821
00:53:57,120 --> 00:54:00,078
He never would have left
if it wasn't 'cause of me.

822
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:03,397
I didn't mean
to make him feel bad.

823
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:07,593
I just-- I-l just wanted him
to-- to be my big brother.

824
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:09,358
Oh. Oh.

825
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:13,109
We gotta go find him.
We just gotta.

826
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,231
And so we will.

827
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:21,673
What we need is--
think, think, think--

828
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:25,394
an exposition.

829
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:28,512
- An expotition?
- Yes.

830
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:31,837
To the place where Tigger is.

831
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:35,396
Or was. Or will be?

832
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:38,950
I believe Rabbit should lead us.

833
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:42,117
- Rabbit?
- Oh, yes.

834
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:45,835
He's the only one who ever says
he knows what he's doing.

835
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:51,114
Absolutely not.

836
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:52,832
I mean, uh--

837
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:55,155
Well, after all, he, uh--

838
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:57,475
I-It was not, uh, my--
he, um--

839
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:59,955
He wanted to leave,
uh, didn't he?

840
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:02,435
But, Rabbit--

841
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:10,279
He could always give
that extra little push...

842
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:12,197
when you needed it.

843
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:14,356
Oh, thank you, Roo.

844
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:18,712
I-It was n-nice to have him here
when things were fr-frightful.

845
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:24,551
Sort of lit up the room
when he came in.

846
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,231
Uh, well, uh--
Y-- Well--

847
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:30,191
What do you need, uh, me for?

848
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:33,039
Why don't you, uh,
go find him yourselves?

849
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:36,197
But we're just not clever enough,
Rabbit.

850
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:39,995
Rabbit. I miss him.

851
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:44,557
Well, l, uh, oh--

852
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:46,477
Oh, very well.

853
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:53,713
- Tigger.
- Tigger!

854
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:58,191
- Tigger!
- Tigger.

855
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:01,232
Now, now, uh, careful, everyone.

856
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:03,954
It's a bit windy!

857
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:08,548
Are you all right, Eeyore?

858
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:13,071
Eeyore? Oh! Oh, d-d-dear!

859
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:17,757
- Help! Ooh!
- Uh, we must take care...

860
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:20,235
to stick together.

861
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:24,239
Perhaps not this stuck, Piglet.

862
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:27,193
P-P-P-Pardon me, P-Pooh.

863
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:29,515
- Tigger!
- Tigger!
- Tigger!

864
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:31,437
- Tigger!
- Tigger!

865
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:35,109
- Where are ya?
- Tigger!

866
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:38,756
Tiggers!

867
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:42,517
Tiggers!

868
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:47,031
Where are you, tiggerseses?

869
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:53,716
I-- I hope they're all okay.

870
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:02,193
Tiggers!

871
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:05,073
Tiggers! Whoa! Whoa!

872
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:11,352

00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:15,473
and most gigantical,
stripedy tree...

874
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:20,390
in all the entire
Hundred Acre Woodses!

875
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:23,398
Is it-- Is it--

876
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:27,193
My family tree!

877
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:38,470
My family tree!

878
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:41,637
I found it. I found it.
I can't believe it!

879
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:46,677
Hello! Hello up there!

880
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:49,712
Where are you, tiggers?
It's me, Tigger!

881
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:53,276
Hello! Hello, family!

882
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:56,676
I got your letter,
and-- and I came to see ya!

883
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:01,077
Hello!

884
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:06,192
Hello?

885
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:07,958
Hello?

886
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:12,112
Maybe they forgot I was comin'.

887
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:17,237
But...

888
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:22,115
I thought-- I thought
you were always there for me.

889
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:41,749
- Tigger.
- Tigger!
- Tigger!

890
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:46,271
- Where are you, Tigger?
- T-Tig-- g-g-g-er!

891
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:52,993
Oh, th-th-th-th-than--

892
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:54,917
Oh, you're-- you're welcome.

893
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:57,793
Tigger!

894
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:06,113
"Dear Tigger."

895
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:11,793
Tigger? Is that you?

896
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:15,799
Tigger! Tigger, it's me, Roo!

897
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:18,673
- Down here!
- Oh, Tigger. Thank goodness.

898
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:20,597
- Tigger! Tigger!
- Tigger!

899
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:24,599
- Tigger! Tigger!
- What? Hello? Did s--

900
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:27,598
- Could it be?
- Tigger, look. Tigger, down here.

901
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:31,349
It looks like the whole family
is finally here!

902
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:34,516
I'm comin', tiggers!

903
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:38,269
Tiggers! Tiggers!

904
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:42,276
- Hey, you're not tiggers.
- It's so wonderful.

905
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:45,073
What are you guyses doin' here?

906
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:47,634
"Doing"?
What are we doing here?

907
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:50,115
We came all this way
to look for you.

908
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:53,915
Now-- Now forget about
all this "other tiggers" nonsense...

909
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:56,190
and, uh, come home.

910
01:00:57,840 --> 01:01:00,035
Nonsense?

911
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:02,754
No! No!

912
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:07,317
No! No! No! No!

913
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:09,556
Are you, uh-- Are you crazy?

914
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:12,353
- It's not safe out here.
- Exactakly!

915
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:16,598
That's why you should all go home
where it is safe.

916
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:20,349
But I've gotta wait here
in my family tree...

917
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:23,233
for my real family!

918
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:25,954
Family! Family! Family!

919
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:30,437
- Family!
- Is that a rumbly in your tumbly, Pooh?

920
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:33,074
I don't think so, Piglet.

921
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:41,795
Come on, hurry up.
No time for dawdling.

922
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:44,195
Not a second to waste.

923
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:47,869
Watch yourself there, Roo boy.
Take care, Pooh bear!

924
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,797
Don't be scared, Piglet.

925
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:52,593
Up ya go, donkey boy!

926
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:57,629
Help! Oh, no, no!

927
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:03,152
Tigger!

928
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:10,998
Oh, no! Oh!

929
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:16,474
The Whoop-de-Dooper,
Loop-de-Looper, Ali-Ooper Bounce.

930
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:18,989
The more you try,
the more you fly.

931
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:20,917
And that's what really counts!

932
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:30,272
Tigger! Tigger!

933
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:32,197
Wake up, Tigger!

934
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:34,117
Wake up!

935
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:30,917
Tigger?

936
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:35,114
- Yes!
- We're alive!

937
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:37,708
- You saved him, Roo.
- That was just wonderful, Roo.

938
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:40,070
- Oh, Roo, that was very brave.
- Hooray.

939
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:44,637
What a Whoop-de-Doopin',
Loop-de-Loopin'
Ali-Oopin' Bounce that was!

940
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:46,557
It was, wasn't it?

941
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:51,196
I mean, I really did it,
didn't l?

942
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:53,117
Did ya?

943
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:58,155
Come here, you. Why, that bounce was
just as good as any old tigger fa--

944
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:03,636
Tigger...

945
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:05,557
family member.

946
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:11,837
Tigger?

947
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:15,637
Please don't go.

948
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:20,872
There they are.

949
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:23,389
We found them.
We found them.

950
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:26,034
- There's Tigger!
- Roo! Oh, Roo.

951
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:29,948
- Mama! Mama!
- We've been searching all over for you.
- How wonderful.

952
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:32,878
Oh, Roo, dear,
I was so worried.

953
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,797
I'm sorry, Mama.

954
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:37,480
- I'm all right.
- Oh, my little Roo.

955
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:40,273
Pooh bear!

956
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:43,836
- Pooh bear!
- Christopher Robin.

957
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:46,679
Pooh bear! Pooh!

958
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:48,597
There you are.

959
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:53,154
- Silly old bear.
- Oh, my!

960
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:56,795
- Nice to see ya.
- Where have you all been?

961
01:04:56,920 --> 01:05:00,071
We were looking for Tigger
looking for Tigger's family.

962
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:03,949
Tigger's family?

963
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:09,269
You didn't have to
go looking for them.

964
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:12,119
But-- But I got a letter, and--

965
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:14,037
and it said that-- that--

966
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:17,072
It was right-- Oh.

967
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:20,272
I must have lost it
in the avalanchee.

968
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:25,153
I can't even remember the words.

969
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:31,117
Dear Tigger,
just a note to say--

970
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:33,117
Dress warmly.

971
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:36,710
- Eat well.
- Stay safe and sound.

972
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:38,398
Keep smilin'.

973
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:40,556
We're always there for you.

974
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:44,070
- Signed--
- Your family.

975
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:51,111
You mean you fell as
are my family?

976
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:56,316
I'm afraid we have
nothing better to offer.

977
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:05,398
Well, of course not, Pooh boy...

978
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:09,069
'cause there's nothin' better
than the best!

979
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:12,316
I should have seen it
all along.

980
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:16,034
Spotted you a mile away.

981
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:24,597
Then the whole mountain
came down on top of us.

982
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:27,996
- But Tigger saved us!
- I wasn't worried at all...

983
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:31,078
except for the part
where I was worried, of course.

984
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:37,919
Ahem, ahoom and et cetera.

985
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:41,191
In honour of this most
occasional occasion...

986
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:44,039
my firs test ever
family reunitin'...

987
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:47,914
I'd like to present each ofya
with a present!

988
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:50,156
Firs test, for Eeyore!

989
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:56,355
A new family room
for your lovely home.

990
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:01,038
Seems kind of big.

991
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:03,799
Bit on the comfy side.

992
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:06,229
Not very drafty.

993
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:10,035
But I suppose
I'll get used to it.

994
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:14,437
I love parties so much.

995
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:22,912
And for Pooh boy,
enough honey to last all winter.

996
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:25,554
Or till next Thursday anyways.

997
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:27,796
Why, thank you, Tigger.

998
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:30,150
It looks good enough to eat.

999
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:36,152
And for Piglet, old pal,
a winter's worth of firewood.

1000
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:38,669
- Keep warm.
- Oh, thank you, Tigger!

1001
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:42,110
Well, you're very welcome.
I think I'll eat a piece myself.

1002
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:48,109
And for you, long ears,
I promise from now on...

1003
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:51,312
I'll always watch
where I'm bouncin'.

1004
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:55,991
Oh, well, thank you,
uh, uh, Tigger.

1005
01:07:56,120 --> 01:07:58,588
Bravo, Tigger! Bravo, I say.

1006
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:00,711
Very well done indeed.

1007
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:03,434
- I'm very impressed.
- Thank you so much!

1008
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:06,597
- Thank you, Tigger.
- Thank you so much, Tigger.

1009
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:10,030
- Oh, look at this.
- Whoa!

1010
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:13,709
You didn't think I was gonna
disremember you, did ya?

1011
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:19,472
Go on. Go on. Open her up.
It's all yours.

1012
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:25,235
Is it really for me, Tigger?

1013
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:31,153
Only the best
for my bestest little brother.

1014
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:36,397
Wait halfa minute.

1015
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:40,593
We still need a family portrait
to put in it.

1016
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:43,154
Look this way, everybody.
Closer.

1017
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:47,594
Smile.

1018
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:03,232
Sunny days and starry nights

1019
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:06,511
And lazy afternoons

1020
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:09,712
You're countin 'castles
in the clouds

1021
01:09:09,840 --> 01:09:12,912
And hummin' little tunes

1022
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:16,112
But somehow
right before your eyes

1023
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:19,073
The summer fades away

1024
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:22,112
Everything is different

1025
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:25,869
And everything has changed

1026
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,991
If you feel lost

1027
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:31,192
And on your own

1028
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:35,552
And far from home

1029
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:38,911
You're never alone, you know

1030
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:41,270
Just think of your friends

1031
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:44,756
The ones who care

1032
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:49,715
They all will be waitin' there

1033
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:52,832
With love to share

1034
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:56,839
And your heart will lead you

1035
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:59,633
Home

1036
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:06,511
Funny how photograph

1037
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:09,871
Can take you backin time

1038
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,468
To places and embraces

1039
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:16,479
That you thought
you'd left behind

1040
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:19,160
They're tryin' to remind you

1041
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:22,511
That you're not the only one

1042
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:25,712
That no one is an island

1043
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:29,594
When all is said and done

1044
01:10:29,720 --> 01:10:31,631
If you feel lost

1045
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:34,877
And on your own

1046
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:39,073
And far from home

1047
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:42,351
You're never alone, you know

1048
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:44,630
Just think of your friends

1049
01:10:44,760 --> 01:10:47,877
The ones who care

1050
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:52,676
They all will be waitin' there

1051
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:55,792
With love to share

1052
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:59,230
And your heart will lead you

1053
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:01,874
Home

1054
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,911
There'll come a day

1055
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:07,952
When you're losin' your way

1056
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:10,992
And you won't know where

1057
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:14,510
You belong

1058
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:20,510
They say that home
is where the heart is

1059
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:23,632
So follow your heart

1060
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:26,593
And know that you can't go wrong

1061
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:28,950
If you feel lost

1062
01:11:29,080 --> 01:11:32,072
And on your own

1063
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:36,113
And far from home

1064
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:39,038
You're never alone, you know

1065
01:11:39,160 --> 01:11:41,390
Just think of your friends

1066
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:44,478
The ones who care

1067
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:49,151
They all will be waitin' there

1068
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:52,113
With love to share

1069
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:55,198
And your heart will lead you

1070
01:11:55,320 --> 01:12:00,394
- If you feel lost
- Lost and on your own

1071
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:04,593
And far from home

1072
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:07,598
You're never alone, you know

1073
01:12:07,720 --> 01:12:10,075
Just think of your friends

1074
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:13,158
The ones who care

1075
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:17,956
They all will be waitin' there

1076
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:21,072
With love to share

1077
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:25,079
And your heart will lead you

1078
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:27,668
Where you belong

1079
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:30,553
I know your heart

1080
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:34,355
Will lead you

1081
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:38,837
Home
