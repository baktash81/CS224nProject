1
00:00:35,902 --> 00:00:38,169
I think I saw something.

2
00:00:38,379 --> 00:00:40,736
Steady lads! We're almost home.

3
00:00:40,737 --> 00:00:44,415
Just a few flaps more we'll
be over the white cliffs of Dover!

4
00:00:48,108 --> 00:00:49,360
Falcon!

5
00:00:51,612 --> 00:00:54,324
- 5 o'clock and coming in hot!
- Then lift it 30!

6
00:00:58,707 --> 00:01:01,106
Stay with me, private! Private!

7
00:01:15,826 --> 00:01:19,696
Wing commander Gutsy!
This just in from a seagull near Dover.

8
00:01:20,045 --> 00:01:22,825
- None of them made it back alive.
- None of them?

9
00:01:22,862 --> 00:01:25,810
But those were some of our top fliers.

10
00:01:25,812 --> 00:01:28,940
I'm sorry, sir.
I'm just a messenger pigeon.

11
00:01:29,733 --> 00:01:32,989
If we don't find some more birds fast,

12
00:01:33,095 --> 00:01:35,806
our goose is going to be cooked.

13
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:24,330
<i>Across the nation and the globe</i>

14
00:02:24,331 --> 00:02:27,632
<i>pigeons are taking wing
in the fight for freedom.</i>

15
00:02:27,669 --> 00:02:31,180
<i>Delivering top secret messages
from behind enemy lines,</i>

16
00:02:31,216 --> 00:02:35,728
<i>these fine feathered aviators are
the pride of the allied forces.</i>

17
00:02:37,105 --> 00:02:40,986
<i>It's the Royal Homing Pigeon
Service that leads the way.</i>

18
00:02:41,023 --> 00:02:45,661
<i>Whether cutting through enemy
lines or just cutting wise.</i>

19
00:02:45,698 --> 00:02:49,727
<i>These proud pigeons are
the model of birdhood.</i>

20
00:02:49,764 --> 00:02:51,753
<i>But don't count out the doves.</i>

21
00:02:51,788 --> 00:02:56,134
<i>War bond birds play a vital role
in raising seeds for the troops.</i>

22
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:58,407
<i>Wait a minute! Ahoy mates!</i>

23
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:00,752
<i>Nursing doves at 2 o'clock.</i>

24
00:03:00,753 --> 00:03:04,057
<i>Now that's what I call a task force!</i>

25
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:06,164
<i>Luxury bird baths, why not?</i>

26
00:03:06,268 --> 00:03:09,237
<i>These hearty heroes
need to look their best.</i>

27
00:03:09,587 --> 00:03:13,327
<i>Of course, not just any pigeon
can make the cut.</i>

28
00:03:13,328 --> 00:03:16,998
<i>But there's always room
for a few brave recruits.</i>

29
00:03:17,035 --> 00:03:21,103
<i>And there they go,
off to another exciting mission.</i>

30
00:03:21,104 --> 00:03:24,013
Homing pigeons, we salute you!

31
00:03:28,955 --> 00:03:31,438
This is the shot boys, watch this.

32
00:03:31,474 --> 00:03:33,398
- Two in the corner...
- Felix! Felix!

33
00:03:33,483 --> 00:03:36,404
- Valiant, do you mind?
- Sorry.

34
00:03:36,405 --> 00:03:37,257
Felix!

35
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:40,618
Felix, I could do it!
I could do that, Felix!

36
00:03:40,785 --> 00:03:44,193
- Do what, lad?
- I could be one of those brave recruits.

37
00:03:44,194 --> 00:03:47,838
Taking wing in the fight for freedom,
I know I could! I know it!

38
00:03:47,874 --> 00:03:50,943
Valiant! What, did I ever tell you?

39
00:03:50,944 --> 00:03:54,988
When I was your age,
I was already on the shores of France.

40
00:03:54,989 --> 00:03:57,805
Aquatic brigade.
Gull division.

41
00:03:57,806 --> 00:04:02,253
If it weren't for me wooden drumstick
and that shrapnel in my poopdeck,

42
00:04:02,254 --> 00:04:05,532
- I'd be out there right now!
- Maybe you're right.

43
00:04:05,656 --> 00:04:09,349
I'm just what they're looking for,
a pigeon with that something extra.

44
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:12,850
Well, you know it's not
a bloke's wingspan that counts,

45
00:04:12,851 --> 00:04:14,979
it's the size of his spirit!

46
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:18,317
Hey, everybody! Look outside!

47
00:04:31,755 --> 00:04:35,129
Royal Homing Pigeon Service!

48
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:37,424
Magnificent doves!

49
00:04:45,633 --> 00:04:49,224
Wing Commander Gutsy!
The most decorated pigeon ever!

50
00:04:49,226 --> 00:04:53,072
Thank you very much.
Yes, much obliged. Thank you.

51
00:04:53,073 --> 00:04:55,063
Come and have a drink with me now!

52
00:04:55,064 --> 00:04:58,387
- What shall it be, boys?
- Bug juice, shaken, not stirred.

53
00:04:58,388 --> 00:05:01,741
The RHPS always drinks on the house!

54
00:05:02,785 --> 00:05:06,122
Bug juice, shaken, not stirred.

55
00:05:06,123 --> 00:05:09,189
Merci beaucoup, ma cherie.

56
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:11,276
He spoke French!

57
00:05:16,031 --> 00:05:21,560
- So, what's the news from the front?
- Can't say, of course. Classified.

58
00:05:22,564 --> 00:05:27,989
But danger is our business, and I'm
sorry to say, business is all too good.

59
00:05:28,235 --> 00:05:30,911
Let me through!
Got to get to Wing Commander...

60
00:05:32,726 --> 00:05:35,578
- Excuse me, Wing Commander!
- Yes?

61
00:05:35,579 --> 00:05:39,238
- Sir, where do I sign up?
- Aren't you a bit on the wee side?

62
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:42,437
Talking about small wingspan,
pip-squeak.

63
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:52,040
There's always a place
for a few valiant birds.

64
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:53,959
Sign up is tomorrow in London.

65
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:57,856
Love to stay and chat,
but duty calls and we must answer.

66
00:05:57,925 --> 00:06:01,832
Beaks up, boys!
Let's make wind.

67
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:07,882
Hip hip hurray!
Hip hip hurray!

68
00:06:32,536 --> 00:06:35,143
I am far more talented than good looking.

69
00:06:37,949 --> 00:06:39,514
Herr General!

70
00:06:40,494 --> 00:06:43,102
Welcome back, General Von Talon.

71
00:06:43,222 --> 00:06:47,549
- Congratulations, sir. Another triumph!
- Ya woll mein General!

72
00:06:48,883 --> 00:06:51,300
Under the Geneva Convention,
as an officer,

73
00:06:51,301 --> 00:06:54,222
I have the right to be
treated as a pigeon of war.

74
00:06:54,648 --> 00:06:58,715
Have no fear, you will be.

75
00:06:59,623 --> 00:07:01,709
Take him to the cage!

76
00:07:03,155 --> 00:07:06,992
Get your talons off me,
you filthy falcons!

77
00:07:12,669 --> 00:07:16,653
Pigeons, pathetic little creatures.

78
00:07:19,032 --> 00:07:21,566
You don't eat your
prisoners of war, do you?

79
00:07:21,567 --> 00:07:23,372
Eat you!

80
00:07:26,044 --> 00:07:27,712
I'm a vegetarian.

81
00:07:28,212 --> 00:07:30,298
And yet you wear a leather cape?

82
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:36,418
Who is your contact in the resistance?

83
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:39,078
You know they'll send
a crack team to rescue me?

84
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:41,739
Rescue you?
You're a pigeon!

85
00:07:41,792 --> 00:07:48,675
- How important do you think you are?
- VIP. Very Important Pigeon!

86
00:07:48,832 --> 00:07:51,700
Very Impudent Pigeon!

87
00:07:51,961 --> 00:07:56,133
Who is your contact in the Resistance?

88
00:07:56,185 --> 00:07:58,792
- Oh, no.
- Speak!

89
00:07:59,719 --> 00:08:02,430
This canary will never sing.

90
00:08:03,183 --> 00:08:06,100
Listen to your mother, you can't go!

91
00:08:06,101 --> 00:08:08,672
Mum, there's a war going on
and I want to do my bit!

92
00:08:08,673 --> 00:08:11,281
- Oh, why, why, why!
- Oh, mum!

93
00:08:12,657 --> 00:08:14,013
Good bye.

94
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:17,036
- Those falcons are going to tear you apart!
- Oh, Mum!

95
00:08:17,854 --> 00:08:20,566
- My dear little baby!
- Mother, that's not helping!

96
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:29,556
- Mother, honestly, I'm gonna be fine!
- You were such a cute little egg!

97
00:08:29,561 --> 00:08:30,969
Oh, mum! Mum,

98
00:08:31,065 --> 00:08:36,038
I'm not an egg anymore!
It's time I left the nest.

99
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:37,900
No one thinks I can do this, and...

100
00:08:38,006 --> 00:08:41,865
Well, it may be my only chance to
show them and myself that they're wrong!

101
00:08:42,408 --> 00:08:46,080
Well, at least have some
breakfast before you go.

102
00:08:46,426 --> 00:08:48,517
Oh, mum. Mum!

103
00:08:48,518 --> 00:08:50,812
No. Thanks!

104
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:54,676
- Oh, Valiant!
- Right then.

105
00:08:55,897 --> 00:08:57,983
I love you.
Good bye!

106
00:09:00,227 --> 00:09:02,104
He'll always be an egg to me.

107
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,413
Ahoy there Valiant!

108
00:09:08,414 --> 00:09:11,184
I'm off now Felix! Wish me luck!

109
00:09:11,281 --> 00:09:13,315
Good luck!

110
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,715
Good bye...

111
00:09:16,466 --> 00:09:19,074
That boy is gonna get creamed.

112
00:09:22,886 --> 00:09:25,806
Valiant pigeon! Fearless flier!

113
00:09:28,126 --> 00:09:29,795
Pride of the Allied forces.

114
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:33,445
Feared by the enemy.
Loved by the ladies.

115
00:09:34,765 --> 00:09:35,808
Humble.

116
00:09:37,909 --> 00:09:40,746
Spits danger smack in the eye!

117
00:09:49,716 --> 00:09:52,324
Look at that! It's London!

118
00:09:58,343 --> 00:10:00,215
Alright, alright, alright. Listen up.

119
00:10:00,321 --> 00:10:03,366
This is easy. I mean for
intelligent guys like you, I can tell ya,

120
00:10:03,367 --> 00:10:05,986
All you gotta do, keep your eyes on
the pebble. You can't go wrong.

121
00:10:05,988 --> 00:10:08,767
She is shy, yeah. Give her a chance,
she will give you the slip.

122
00:10:09,185 --> 00:10:11,172
Find her and the crumbs is yours!

123
00:10:11,202 --> 00:10:13,715
Easy as pie. I don't...
I don't know how I stay in business.

124
00:10:13,716 --> 00:10:16,000
There it is. Not under that one.
Where is it now?

125
00:10:16,738 --> 00:10:18,800
Find her and the crumbs is yours,
the crumbs is yours!

126
00:10:18,988 --> 00:10:20,656
Which one is it under?

127
00:10:21,319 --> 00:10:22,988
- That one!
- That one?

128
00:10:23,322 --> 00:10:25,230
Oh, no! Bad luck again!

129
00:10:25,335 --> 00:10:30,498
Give you one more go? Law of averages.
I think you're gonna win this time.

130
00:10:30,706 --> 00:10:33,419
Serious thing, which
one has the pebble?

131
00:10:34,391 --> 00:10:37,072
Well, that would s...
In all the excitement I forgot myself.

132
00:10:37,177 --> 00:10:40,202
What would you gents say to a...
A game of...

133
00:10:40,615 --> 00:10:43,430
You big cheat!
Give me my crumbs back!

134
00:10:43,431 --> 00:10:45,465
On the level, gents.
Listen, I know what you're thinking...

135
00:10:45,517 --> 00:10:47,812
Come and get me, falcons!

136
00:10:52,856 --> 00:10:54,942
Strike me down if I tell a lie.

137
00:10:57,467 --> 00:10:58,979
Look at him. That was lucky.

138
00:10:59,285 --> 00:11:01,893
Prayers were answered.
That's never worked before but...

139
00:11:02,258 --> 00:11:04,133
- Hello, mate!
- I lost control, but then...

140
00:11:04,135 --> 00:11:06,816
You could not have picked
a better time to drop in.

141
00:11:07,234 --> 00:11:08,170
Bugsy's the name.

142
00:11:08,171 --> 00:11:10,570
I'm terribly sorry, I'm Valiant.

143
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:15,399
- So what brings you to my manor?
- Well, I've come to be an aviator.

144
00:11:15,556 --> 00:11:19,390
With the Royal Homing Pigeon Service.
Fighting for king and country!

145
00:11:19,391 --> 00:11:20,405
You don't say.

146
00:11:20,406 --> 00:11:23,000
Well, I've never been much
of a hope and glory bird myself.

147
00:11:23,001 --> 00:11:25,904
I'm rather partial to a little
something called freedom.

148
00:11:25,905 --> 00:11:27,862
Yeah, oh yeah, I flit about as I please.

149
00:11:27,863 --> 00:11:30,016
No one telling me what to do,
or when to do it.

150
00:11:30,017 --> 00:11:33,285
- Are those flies?
- They...

151
00:11:33,496 --> 00:11:35,060
They're friends of mine.

152
00:11:37,026 --> 00:11:40,650
So, RHPS recruit in the head.
Good idea, yeah. Right this way mate.

153
00:11:40,651 --> 00:11:43,620
I'm feeling rather patriotic myself,
all of a sudden.

154
00:11:46,376 --> 00:11:48,462
- There he is!
- Come on, after him.

155
00:11:55,294 --> 00:11:57,099
Let's keep going, come on.

156
00:11:58,456 --> 00:12:00,579
He's here somewhere.
I can smell him.

157
00:12:00,998 --> 00:12:02,457
Follow my lead, mate.

158
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,097
Hello! Two to enlist please.

159
00:12:06,098 --> 00:12:09,009
Valiant pigeon,
reporting for duty, sir.

160
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:10,104
Never heard of you.

161
00:12:10,105 --> 00:12:12,981
Valiant pigeon, yeah, yeah.
THE Valiant pigeon.

162
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:15,982
- You don't have Valiant on your list?
- No!

163
00:12:16,571 --> 00:12:19,063
- Clerical error.
- Should I have?

164
00:12:19,064 --> 00:12:21,144
Yes, I think you should have.

165
00:12:21,145 --> 00:12:23,856
<i>Look at him! He's a perfect specimen.
Do something.</i>

166
00:12:23,857 --> 00:12:26,246
He's fast as lightning,
strong as knocks.

167
00:12:26,637 --> 00:12:29,440
Very tall for his height. Stand up, yeah.
Sit back down again.

168
00:12:30,295 --> 00:12:34,989
The bird's a legend in the strapping...
...Barkley Hampshire area.

169
00:12:35,346 --> 00:12:36,704
Too small!

170
00:12:36,809 --> 00:12:40,665
You should be "yea" high
and you're not even "hey" high.

171
00:12:41,248 --> 00:12:44,336
- Charming, that's charming that is.
- And you!

172
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,469
Have you by any chance
heard of a birdbath?

173
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:52,294
Sad truth is, I've got me
a rare feather condition. Yeah.

174
00:12:52,295 --> 00:12:55,683
Can't go near a bath, or look at a bath,
and it makes me itch.

175
00:12:55,684 --> 00:12:57,192
Clear off the territory. Get lost!

176
00:12:57,193 --> 00:13:00,211
But, well,
Wing Commander Gutsy, he... he...

177
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:03,089
Exact... Yes.
Wing Commander Gutsy. That's right.

178
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:05,550
Valiant's best mate.
They went to school together.

179
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:07,156
You don't wanna get on
the wrong side of him,

180
00:13:07,157 --> 00:13:10,398
if he hears about this you are
gonna lose those stripes, mate.

181
00:13:11,273 --> 00:13:15,573
- You know Wing Commander Gutsy, you say?
- Well, ah... yeah.

182
00:13:15,658 --> 00:13:18,213
Well, that makes a difference.

183
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:22,114
- Sign here.
- Thank you! Thank you, sir.

184
00:13:22,438 --> 00:13:24,753
There he is!
You dirty clowns!

185
00:13:25,102 --> 00:13:27,985
When I get hold of you,
I'm gonna knock your beak off!

186
00:13:28,091 --> 00:13:31,137
- Hey! That's it! Pigeons Only.
- Get your wings off me!

187
00:13:34,205 --> 00:13:36,312
- Where do I sign up?
- Just sign here.

188
00:13:41,785 --> 00:13:44,282
- All right gents, in you go.
- Thank you, sir.

189
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,049
Who is this Gutsy geezer anyway?

190
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:49,415
If I see your ugly face around
here, I'm gonna have you!

191
00:13:52,754 --> 00:13:54,564
- We made it!
- Safe and sound.

192
00:13:54,565 --> 00:13:56,908
We're in the
Royal Homing Pigeon Service!

193
00:13:56,909 --> 00:13:59,924
The elite of the elite!
Fighting the heroic battle to save our...

194
00:13:59,925 --> 00:14:04,098
To save... our tail feathers,
which worked like a charm.

195
00:14:04,229 --> 00:14:05,669
Even though I say so myself.

196
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:08,193
So, with that, I'll be hittin' the skyway.

197
00:14:08,382 --> 00:14:10,467
Cheers mate, good luck. God bless.

198
00:14:10,468 --> 00:14:13,059
If you make it back in one piece,
be sure to...

199
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,266
look me... up...

200
00:14:15,412 --> 00:14:17,291
Hello? Hello?

201
00:14:21,506 --> 00:14:24,634
Gents, hello! Hello!

202
00:14:25,696 --> 00:14:28,416
No! There's been a terrible mistake!

203
00:14:28,417 --> 00:14:31,547
Trust me, this is
all gonna work out brilliantly.

204
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:34,291
Look, come on! Come on...

205
00:14:37,847 --> 00:14:41,132
I've been shanghaied.

206
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:03,819
That's a bit bright.

207
00:15:18,048 --> 00:15:21,054
- Sorry about that.
- I didn't mean to hurt ya little fella.

208
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:25,137
Hey, little fella!
It's not the size of your wingspan, no!

209
00:15:25,138 --> 00:15:27,081
It's the size of your spirit!

210
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:29,199
- If you say so, mate.
- Can't argue with that.

211
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,655
Well, I'm Tailfeather.
This is Toughwood, my brother.

212
00:15:32,947 --> 00:15:34,574
Not the sharpest beak on the block.

213
00:15:35,932 --> 00:15:38,602
- ...not the sharpest beak...
- What?!

214
00:15:38,655 --> 00:15:39,332
But...

215
00:15:39,385 --> 00:15:42,200
If you're ever in a scrum, there's
no better bird to have on your team.

216
00:15:42,201 --> 00:15:43,347
Yep, absolutely.

217
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,486
Nice to meet you. I'm Valiant.

218
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:48,201
- Valiant? It's good to meet you.
- Let's go!

219
00:15:48,724 --> 00:15:51,682
- It's two for the Tailfeather.
- Tailfeather, six to none.

220
00:15:59,675 --> 00:16:01,841
For a, quote, "elite unit", unquote,

221
00:16:01,842 --> 00:16:04,619
they seem to be letting in
almost anything with wings.

222
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:07,247
Including those flies,
circling your bottom.

223
00:16:07,478 --> 00:16:11,964
- Who do you think you are?
- I'm Lofty Thadious Worthington Pigeon.

224
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:16,254
I come from a long and honorable
line of warrior pigeons, but...

225
00:16:16,255 --> 00:16:18,132
Hello lads!

226
00:16:20,311 --> 00:16:22,564
I trust you've had a pleasant journey.

227
00:16:22,709 --> 00:16:26,086
Ah, well, I think
I speak for all of us when I say,

228
00:16:26,087 --> 00:16:28,926
the ride was a bit bumpy on the way in.

229
00:16:28,928 --> 00:16:32,849
Maybe, check the suspension
on that motorbike.

230
00:16:32,954 --> 00:16:34,950
And actually, we are all a wee bit thirsty,

231
00:16:34,951 --> 00:16:37,473
if we could have some cold drinks,
that would be nice.

232
00:16:37,474 --> 00:16:39,460
Yeah. Yeah.

233
00:16:39,461 --> 00:16:43,011
Of course! Well, that can
certainly be arranged, yeah.

234
00:16:43,151 --> 00:16:49,056
Right after I sprout beak feathers
and turn into a flamingo!

235
00:16:49,057 --> 00:16:52,968
Now fall in, feather brains! Fall in!

236
00:16:58,264 --> 00:17:02,498
For the next six weeks
your tails belong to me.

237
00:17:02,535 --> 00:17:07,205
You'll learn to march like birds,
fly like birds and fight like birds.

238
00:17:07,206 --> 00:17:11,158
I will make birds of you turkeys
even if it kills you!

239
00:17:11,638 --> 00:17:13,098
Except you.

240
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:18,798
- You won't last a week.
- Permission to die trying, sir!

241
00:17:19,775 --> 00:17:23,274
It's like this, ladies. You will shape up
and you will shape up fast,

242
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:27,077
or I will personally
drum you out of the corps!

243
00:17:27,078 --> 00:17:29,772
Well, funny you should...
I would love to get drummed out.

244
00:17:29,773 --> 00:17:32,416
I was gonna bring it up if you hadn't.
So...

245
00:17:32,417 --> 00:17:33,733
Hey, leave him alone!

246
00:17:33,734 --> 00:17:36,461
- He helped me to enlist...
- Pipe down, pip-squeak!

247
00:17:36,462 --> 00:17:41,515
I'm more interested in having
you all drop and give me 50!

248
00:17:41,552 --> 00:17:44,730
Courtesy of your short little friend here.

249
00:17:48,861 --> 00:17:50,071
Training at last.

250
00:17:50,592 --> 00:17:53,337
I say old bean,
wouldn't it be more sporting

251
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:56,853
if the chap who actually
committed the infraction... ow!

252
00:17:57,018 --> 00:18:01,339
Gentlemen, welcome to the
Royal Homing Pigeon Service.

253
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:12,270
For the last time,
what was your mission?

254
00:18:12,271 --> 00:18:16,319
And where are these
messages coming from?

255
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,363
Ha!

256
00:18:17,634 --> 00:18:20,827
Very well. Have it your way.

257
00:18:24,017 --> 00:18:28,791
- You want us to pluck out his feathers?
- And to clip his wings?

258
00:18:28,792 --> 00:18:31,049
Hurt his feelings?

259
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,244
No, no, no, no.

260
00:18:34,453 --> 00:18:38,519
Worse. Much worse.

261
00:18:40,189 --> 00:18:41,650
We have ways...

262
00:18:41,859 --> 00:18:43,945
of making you squawk.

263
00:18:54,062 --> 00:18:56,043
What kind of birds are you?

264
00:19:01,303 --> 00:19:03,806
Must resist yodeling... music!

265
00:19:26,343 --> 00:19:27,960
One two, one two!

266
00:19:28,794 --> 00:19:30,567
And... halt!

267
00:19:30,911 --> 00:19:34,605
Now fall out and report
to the nursing dove.

268
00:19:34,635 --> 00:19:36,199
<i>- Nurses? Brilliant!
- Nurses?</i>

269
00:19:41,831 --> 00:19:43,575
- Hello nurse.
- Look at her!

270
00:19:43,604 --> 00:19:45,898
Well, I've been waiting for you.

271
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:50,082
Do you have a little something for a brave
pigeon about to go into battle, hey darling?

272
00:19:50,184 --> 00:19:52,882
It just so happens I do
have something for you.

273
00:19:53,716 --> 00:19:55,062
Did you hear that?

274
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:57,893
Is this what you had in mind?

275
00:20:00,497 --> 00:20:02,375
It's awfully big.

276
00:20:03,422 --> 00:20:06,247
You're kind of short for a nursing dove.

277
00:20:06,693 --> 00:20:08,466
Look who's talking!

278
00:20:08,637 --> 00:20:12,036
I'd say you're kind
of short for a carrier pigeon.

279
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:17,086
- I'm Valiant by the way.
- All right then Valiant. I'm Victoria.

280
00:20:20,422 --> 00:20:25,974
Now, I know you lads have had a tiring day.
What you need is a nice relaxing shower.

281
00:20:41,805 --> 00:20:44,210
<i>Then I'll treat you to a fancy dinner.</i>

282
00:20:59,848 --> 00:21:01,985
<i>We'll get you a little feathercut.</i>

283
00:21:07,201 --> 00:21:09,498
<i>Set you up with some uniforms.</i>

284
00:21:17,298 --> 00:21:18,831
Beg your pardon.

285
00:21:19,207 --> 00:21:21,308
- Did that hurt?!
- Did that?

286
00:21:23,681 --> 00:21:24,515
That's it!

287
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:28,734
Come here!

288
00:21:29,782 --> 00:21:32,992
And we'll all turn in
for a good night's sleep.

289
00:21:39,605 --> 00:21:43,675
So this is where the smelly rotten
bits of disgusting refuse are dumped.

290
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,847
And our sleeping quarters would be where?

291
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,809
I'll never sleep in here.

292
00:21:56,588 --> 00:21:58,466
Well, this isn't so bad.

293
00:22:01,177 --> 00:22:04,499
Just like home.

294
00:22:12,755 --> 00:22:13,797
I've had enough!

295
00:22:18,331 --> 00:22:19,374
Speak!

296
00:22:19,931 --> 00:22:25,667
Lieutenant Mercury, Royal Homing
Pigeon Service, 4121444444697.

297
00:22:27,618 --> 00:22:29,704
Bring me the truth serum.

298
00:22:30,329 --> 00:22:31,059
Right away.

299
00:22:33,198 --> 00:22:34,627
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

300
00:22:37,057 --> 00:22:41,175
One shot of this,
and we will know... everything!

301
00:22:41,176 --> 00:22:45,035
I'll never talk! Never! Never!

302
00:22:55,622 --> 00:22:58,496
Wakey wakey!

303
00:23:04,422 --> 00:23:09,220
You bird brains are Squad F.
You know what that means?

304
00:23:09,972 --> 00:23:13,519
- Squad Fantastic!
- I've got it! Squad Formidable!

305
00:23:14,135 --> 00:23:15,438
Philosophical!

306
00:23:15,648 --> 00:23:16,690
No!

307
00:23:16,691 --> 00:23:21,385
It means you are
the fliers... of the future.

308
00:23:24,931 --> 00:23:29,015
The far future!
But my job, somehow, is

309
00:23:29,016 --> 00:23:32,547
to make you the carrier pigeons of today.

310
00:23:38,202 --> 00:23:41,478
Good maneuver. It might help
if you kept your eyes open.

311
00:23:41,603 --> 00:23:44,273
- Better get you back to your nursing dove.
- Thanks, Bugsy.

312
00:23:45,859 --> 00:23:47,978
You must really like it here,

313
00:23:47,981 --> 00:23:51,110
because this is the third time
this week you've been to see me.

314
00:23:51,527 --> 00:23:54,179
- I wish you'd be more careful.
- Don't you worry.

315
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:56,041
Where I come from,
danger is our business.

316
00:23:56,221 --> 00:23:58,544
Yeah, we spit danger in the eye.

317
00:23:59,207 --> 00:24:02,008
If they can dish it out,
well, I can take it.

318
00:24:02,114 --> 00:24:05,014
- And where do you come from?
- West Nestington.

319
00:24:05,467 --> 00:24:08,075
That's near Nestington, it's...

320
00:24:08,255 --> 00:24:09,819
close to the west of it actually.

321
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,317
Oh, Valiant!

322
00:24:14,214 --> 00:24:18,867
Well I have to...
return to my duties, so...

323
00:24:22,087 --> 00:24:23,339
Good bye.

324
00:24:24,695 --> 00:24:26,155
But Valiant, wait!

325
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,100
As homing pigeons it's our
duty to transport messages.

326
00:24:34,661 --> 00:24:38,482
In the worst of conditions,
wind, rain, sleet, snow,

327
00:24:38,517 --> 00:24:42,236
bombs exploding, bullets flying
and as if that weren't enough,

328
00:24:42,424 --> 00:24:47,660
mother nature has the audacity
to create a little something called...

329
00:24:48,163 --> 00:24:49,623
The Falcon.

330
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:54,589
20 pounds of pigeon eating muscle,
measuring five of your wing spans.

331
00:24:54,922 --> 00:25:00,264
They like to blind side their prey,
at speeds in excess of 200 miles per hour.

332
00:25:00,365 --> 00:25:02,767
But not to bite. Not yet.

333
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:06,689
The first strike is merely for impact.
They'll let you drop of it,

334
00:25:06,935 --> 00:25:12,533
making sure you're defenseless, and
scoop you up in their razor sharp talons.

335
00:25:15,385 --> 00:25:19,974
And in the dark of the night, you'll
have but a split second to recognize...

336
00:25:19,975 --> 00:25:23,104
friend from foe.

337
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:27,221
Friend or foe?

338
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:28,390
- Foe! - Foe!
- No!

339
00:25:28,631 --> 00:25:31,030
You idiots, it's a pigeon!

340
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:32,347
Friend or foe?

341
00:25:32,557 --> 00:25:35,410
- Foe! No, friend!
- That's friend! Or maybe...

342
00:25:35,411 --> 00:25:37,820
- No! It's a foe.
- Ah! Yes, yes!

343
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,322
Friend or foe?

344
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:45,916
- Friend!
- Friend! Oh, yes. My friend.

345
00:25:49,387 --> 00:25:52,516
99, 100.

346
00:25:53,533 --> 00:25:55,201
101.

347
00:25:55,645 --> 00:25:57,105
102!

348
00:25:58,957 --> 00:26:05,153
To survive his mission, a pigeon must have
the strength to carry his message capsule.

349
00:26:18,047 --> 00:26:21,387
He must have the speed
to fly like the wind.

350
00:26:30,564 --> 00:26:31,607
<i>Evasive action!</i>

351
00:26:31,754 --> 00:26:33,391
He must have the agility...

352
00:26:34,341 --> 00:26:36,427
to outmaneuver the enemy.

353
00:26:42,398 --> 00:26:46,300
And he must have the endurance
to battle the elements,

354
00:26:46,441 --> 00:26:50,222
flying long distances over raging seas.

355
00:26:58,851 --> 00:27:00,780
- Me again.
- Valiant.

356
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:06,413
My favorite!
How did you know?

357
00:27:19,711 --> 00:27:22,631
The parrot says to me
"How about we do a loop to loop?"

358
00:27:22,632 --> 00:27:24,447
I said, "I can't do a loop to loop."

359
00:27:29,217 --> 00:27:32,795
He says, "Why ever not?"
I say, "Well, I'm afraid of heights!"

360
00:27:32,796 --> 00:27:36,458
He says, "You?!
Afraid of heights? That's ridiculous!"

361
00:27:36,772 --> 00:27:40,747
I said, "Well, maybe to you,
mate, but not to me."

362
00:27:43,344 --> 00:27:44,679
- That's it, that's it.
- Come on!

363
00:27:47,122 --> 00:27:50,376
- Afternoon Monty!
- Hello Guts. What news?

364
00:27:50,481 --> 00:27:52,149
Not good I'm afraid.

365
00:27:52,567 --> 00:27:55,486
We just lost Squadron E over Belgium.

366
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:59,201
That means these new
recruits are our only chance.

367
00:27:59,972 --> 00:28:01,641
And they'll have to leave tomorrow.

368
00:28:02,214 --> 00:28:05,812
You can't be serious. They
haven't even finished their training.

369
00:28:05,896 --> 00:28:08,918
<i>Attack formation... Steady...</i>

370
00:28:15,408 --> 00:28:17,494
Sorry, but those are the orders.

371
00:28:17,912 --> 00:28:22,084
Have them ready at 1800 tomorrow,
Monty old boy. Cheers.

372
00:28:25,386 --> 00:28:27,472
Commander Gutsy is here, so...

373
00:28:28,029 --> 00:28:31,158
So I suppose you'll
be shipping out soon.

374
00:28:31,262 --> 00:28:35,277
I know, I know! I can't wait! I mean,
this is the moment I've been waiting for!

375
00:28:36,185 --> 00:28:39,940
Well, I'd like to be part of
what you come home to.

376
00:28:40,909 --> 00:28:45,603
I don't care if you're a hero.
Just concentrate on the getting back.

377
00:28:56,815 --> 00:28:59,110
You need to understand something, lads.

378
00:29:00,086 --> 00:29:02,953
Our losses have been heavy. Catastrophic.

379
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,405
You're all we've got!

380
00:29:06,255 --> 00:29:11,261
And so, today,
we fight for our country.

381
00:29:11,522 --> 00:29:16,162
Tomorrow our feathers may be
plucked from our lifeless bodies,

382
00:29:16,163 --> 00:29:19,762
our innards spread like jam on toast,

383
00:29:19,814 --> 00:29:23,412
and our bones fed to rabid weasels.

384
00:29:23,986 --> 00:29:25,394
But never mind that.

385
00:29:26,082 --> 00:29:31,698
On this day, in this place,
let it forever be known,

386
00:29:31,699 --> 00:29:37,957
that you pigeons did your
part in the heroic battle for...

387
00:29:40,518 --> 00:29:42,604
- Seeds!
- Freedom!

388
00:29:42,656 --> 00:29:47,245
Right! You will be Commander
Gutsy's support wing.

389
00:29:47,777 --> 00:29:53,304
I expect you to do whatever it takes
to ensure the success of his mission.

390
00:29:53,848 --> 00:29:59,229
Chaps, the message we have been sent
to carry is of the utmost importance.

391
00:29:59,448 --> 00:30:01,782
The outcome of the war
could well depend on it.

392
00:30:01,923 --> 00:30:07,728
We pigeons have never been entrusted
with a more critical or dangerous mission.

393
00:30:08,845 --> 00:30:13,278
May you fly straight! And may
your instinct guide you home.

394
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:21,299
- What did Gutsy mean by "highly dangerous"?
- I don't know. But I can tell you this.

395
00:30:22,185 --> 00:30:24,897
I am a bird of principle.

396
00:30:27,087 --> 00:30:29,278
And my number one principle is...

397
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:33,602
don't get involved with anything
called "highly dangerous"!

398
00:30:34,753 --> 00:30:39,865
And I will never violate my core beliefs.
Do not ask me to violate my core beliefs.

399
00:30:39,969 --> 00:30:41,446
You're talking to the wrong pigeon.

400
00:30:42,003 --> 00:30:46,905
Sir, point of clarification please.
Regarding the highly dangerous mission.

401
00:30:47,061 --> 00:30:49,876
- I've got a doctor's note.
- Zip it, Stinky.

402
00:30:49,877 --> 00:30:52,014
Yeah. Sure, now I understand, and...

403
00:30:52,015 --> 00:30:57,281
And I truly regret that I have
but one life to give for my country.

404
00:30:57,282 --> 00:31:01,037
I'd love to die, love to die.
Can't. Not Sunday. Bad for me.

405
00:31:01,038 --> 00:31:03,644
- Are you finished?
- Not quite. Well, listen...

406
00:31:03,645 --> 00:31:06,564
Maybe I'm not that conscientious,
but I do object.

407
00:31:06,566 --> 00:31:08,443
Get back to the barracks!

408
00:31:09,766 --> 00:31:11,017
Now!

409
00:31:14,127 --> 00:31:15,951
Do I still have to go on
the dangerous mission?

410
00:31:15,952 --> 00:31:17,083
- Now!
- Yep.

411
00:31:18,002 --> 00:31:20,797
- I'll take that as... yes, I do.
- Now!

412
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:34,568
- Hey, hey! Where are you going?
- Shh! Keep it down, mate.

413
00:31:34,917 --> 00:31:38,845
- Got some serious flying ahead.
- Flying, what do you mean fl...

414
00:31:38,846 --> 00:31:41,761
- Flying to where?
- Back to old Trafalgar Square, son.

415
00:31:41,767 --> 00:31:44,114
You're not leaving,
you'll break up the team!

416
00:31:44,166 --> 00:31:46,461
Team? I'm not a team player.

417
00:31:46,774 --> 00:31:48,703
Old bug buster plays solo.

418
00:31:48,807 --> 00:31:51,420
Bigger question's not why I'm leaving,
but why are you staying?

419
00:31:51,421 --> 00:31:54,974
Why am I sta... Well, because
it's my duty, it's our duty!

420
00:31:55,222 --> 00:31:58,403
Hold on! Sorry!
Have I missed something?

421
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:01,985
Did we start this? No.
Did we make those?

422
00:32:02,888 --> 00:32:04,197
Or those?

423
00:32:04,557 --> 00:32:06,955
I've seen them before, mate.
And it's not a pretty sight.

424
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:08,807
The truth is...

425
00:32:10,032 --> 00:32:12,543
I'm scared. Alright?

426
00:32:13,527 --> 00:32:16,257
Don't tell them that.
'cause I'll... I'll deny it.

427
00:32:16,656 --> 00:32:20,410
- Well, I'm scared too.
- Well, then come with me. Yeah.

428
00:32:20,828 --> 00:32:23,142
Trafalgar Square will be ours. Come on!

429
00:32:23,435 --> 00:32:25,521
But we didn't make Trafalgar Square either.

430
00:32:25,954 --> 00:32:28,609
And where do we go when
they start dropping bombs there?

431
00:32:29,328 --> 00:32:31,727
No, no, I'm staying. I'm doing my bit.

432
00:32:32,613 --> 00:32:35,742
Yeah...
They're lucky to have you, mate.

433
00:32:37,307 --> 00:32:39,601
Anyway, keep your wings dry, yeah?

434
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,845
- What's happenin'?
- What's going on?

435
00:32:47,742 --> 00:32:53,645
It's time for me to fly the coop, all right?
So, I guess this is farewell.

436
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:54,396
All right?

437
00:32:54,397 --> 00:32:57,445
- Wait, where are you goin'?
- You can't just leave, Bugsy.

438
00:32:59,211 --> 00:33:03,070
Look, I've got urgent
business to take care of, and...

439
00:33:05,915 --> 00:33:07,751
I better catch the wind
while it's blowing.

440
00:33:10,579 --> 00:33:13,927
Look me up when you get back, yeah?!
You know where I'll be!

441
00:33:30,556 --> 00:33:33,164
Gentlemen, take your places!

442
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:39,423
Our mission is to be dropped behind
enemy lines in occupied France.

443
00:33:39,752 --> 00:33:41,858
To make contact with
the French resistance.

444
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:46,893
To get a vital top secret message and
bring it back here by sundown tomorrow.

445
00:33:47,243 --> 00:33:52,068
Good luck. The fate of the freedom
loving world depends on us.

446
00:34:39,444 --> 00:34:40,487
Wait!

447
00:34:41,425 --> 00:34:43,303
Hey, Bugsy!

448
00:34:44,189 --> 00:34:46,943
You can't go without me!
I can't let you get all the glory!

449
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:10,942
Good luck, lads.

450
00:35:22,259 --> 00:35:26,953
- Hey, Bugsy! Thanks for coming back!
- Ah! I'll tell you the truth.

451
00:35:27,161 --> 00:35:29,455
It's the first worthwhile
thing I've ever done.

452
00:35:29,939 --> 00:35:31,886
We're gonna be fine. Right, Lofty?

453
00:35:31,906 --> 00:35:32,931
Yes. I...

454
00:35:34,138 --> 00:35:37,685
Indubitably!
Birds of a feather and all that, what?

455
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:43,379
- Right Lofty ol' mate. We stick together.
- Hey Tailfeather, can you believe that

456
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:47,493
we're the ones they pick to send on the
most important mission in World War II?

457
00:35:47,917 --> 00:35:48,907
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

458
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:50,472
Me too!

459
00:35:55,687 --> 00:35:57,564
Truthfully, I'm not a good singer anyway.

460
00:35:58,199 --> 00:35:59,242
Always off key.

461
00:36:00,714 --> 00:36:04,344
Enough already!
You've been jabbering for days!

462
00:36:04,553 --> 00:36:08,203
Hey, hey, who gave me the serum?
You want me to talk, okay I'm talking.

463
00:36:08,271 --> 00:36:11,957
Truth be told, I'm glad you did this.
Homing Pigeon racket is all well and good,

464
00:36:11,958 --> 00:36:14,304
but it's a stiff upper beak
rubbish all the time,

465
00:36:14,305 --> 00:36:16,912
I mean, I've got feelings
and I wanna express them, like...

466
00:36:17,538 --> 00:36:20,334
I always used to think my favorite
color was blue, cause it's for boys.

467
00:36:20,335 --> 00:36:21,337
Now I realize that I love...

468
00:36:23,066 --> 00:36:24,673
Shut up! Shut up!

469
00:36:27,033 --> 00:36:29,723
I demand better treatment I mean
the mice don't treat me like this!

470
00:36:29,741 --> 00:36:31,921
You know those charming
little Resistance chappies,

471
00:36:32,026 --> 00:36:33,756
with their fabulous
view over the harbor.

472
00:36:33,757 --> 00:36:37,094
The last time I was
in the attic in St. Pierre...

473
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:39,598
St. Pierre?

474
00:36:42,622 --> 00:36:48,503
The truth serum is genius.
Cover his cage!

475
00:36:49,297 --> 00:36:52,844
I'm curious,
what is your favorite color?

476
00:36:53,731 --> 00:36:54,564
Pink!

477
00:36:55,949 --> 00:36:58,975
Not like a hot pink, or a pastely pink.

478
00:36:59,482 --> 00:37:02,440
Just a kind of, well of, a pink pink.
You know what I mean, I mean,

479
00:37:02,492 --> 00:37:04,193
none of the rinky dink pinks.

480
00:37:06,779 --> 00:37:08,447
Excuse me.

481
00:37:09,503 --> 00:37:11,797
I like pink too.

482
00:37:21,214 --> 00:37:23,508
Come on. Chin up, Valiant!

483
00:37:24,265 --> 00:37:25,412
Stiff upper beak.

484
00:37:25,809 --> 00:37:28,207
Gentlemen, get ready to drop!

485
00:37:28,901 --> 00:37:30,898
Are you ready to drop?

486
00:37:31,539 --> 00:37:33,625
I think I've dropped already!

487
00:37:38,319 --> 00:37:41,750
It's okay to be scared, fellows!
I'd be worried if you weren't.

488
00:37:41,995 --> 00:37:44,920
It won't get better,
but you'll get used to it!

489
00:37:47,967 --> 00:37:49,218
Go! Go! Go!

490
00:37:59,179 --> 00:38:00,222
It's jammed!

491
00:38:02,099 --> 00:38:06,585
- Sir, let me help you!
- No! Go now! That's an order!

492
00:38:07,471 --> 00:38:08,409
Yes, sir.

493
00:38:24,003 --> 00:38:25,568
Come on Gutsy, get out of there!

494
00:38:28,227 --> 00:38:29,270
Come on.

495
00:38:46,681 --> 00:38:49,868
Hello? Hello? A little help chaps?

496
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:51,746
Hold on there,
we'll get you out of there now.

497
00:38:52,164 --> 00:38:55,903
Cheers! Bit of a tenuous landing that,
but, I dare say it could've been worse.

498
00:38:56,007 --> 00:38:57,093
<i>Watch out!</i>

499
00:38:57,118 --> 00:38:58,318
- Look out!
- Oh, my.

500
00:39:00,424 --> 00:39:02,824
- Sorry Lofty.
- Not to worry, old chap.

501
00:39:04,211 --> 00:39:06,088
I say, a bit of a muddle, this.

502
00:39:07,131 --> 00:39:10,990
- But at least we're all in one piece.
- Not quite all.

503
00:39:11,147 --> 00:39:13,858
- Where's Gutsy?
- He was still in the plane.

504
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:15,631
What do you mean
he was still in the plane?

505
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,926
His cage got stuck. I...

506
00:39:18,343 --> 00:39:20,690
- I don't think he got out.
- Ah! Well, that's it!

507
00:39:20,743 --> 00:39:23,715
We're dead! We're finished!
It's been a good run. Nice knowing you.

508
00:39:23,924 --> 00:39:26,478
You're quite mistaken, ol' boy.
I'm sure he made it out.

509
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:29,869
Gutsy always makes it out, he's going to
come and find us any minute now.

510
00:39:30,182 --> 00:39:31,642
And give us the plans for the mission.

511
00:39:38,525 --> 00:39:42,489
- Then who has the backup plan?
- You want the backup plan?

512
00:39:42,541 --> 00:39:47,233
- We die. That's the backup plan.
- But I'm not ready to die!

513
00:39:47,234 --> 00:39:53,032
- Am I ready? No one's asked me!
- So many books to read! Regrets! Why?

514
00:39:53,284 --> 00:39:55,108
That's it. We're dead.
Thank you very much.

515
00:39:55,109 --> 00:39:56,987
Everyone be quiet. Quiet!

516
00:39:58,916 --> 00:40:00,168
We need a plan.

517
00:40:01,795 --> 00:40:03,046
And the plan is...

518
00:40:04,027 --> 00:40:06,947
Is to find a safe location
to plan the next move.

519
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:15,187
- You heard the bird.
- So, our plan is to... make a plan?

520
00:40:16,804 --> 00:40:17,638
Come on.

521
00:40:27,125 --> 00:40:28,585
France is spooky.

522
00:40:29,268 --> 00:40:30,832
<i>Vive la France!</i>

523
00:40:31,145 --> 00:40:34,900
Quiet! Did you hear that?
There's someone in there!

524
00:40:35,318 --> 00:40:37,612
Somebody better go and have a look.

525
00:40:45,122 --> 00:40:46,790
All right, I'll go.

526
00:41:05,043 --> 00:41:06,816
All right you turkeys, let's go.

527
00:41:08,641 --> 00:41:12,761
Valiant, just pull yourself together.
There's nothing in here.

528
00:41:12,866 --> 00:41:17,350
Unless you're counting guns, bombs,
all the falcons, the pigeon-eating falcons.

529
00:41:17,403 --> 00:41:18,654
Pigeon-eating falcons!

530
00:41:23,191 --> 00:41:27,364
Come on, Tailfeather, let's get you
out of the grail. Come on, here we go.

531
00:41:30,283 --> 00:41:32,579
<i>- Thanks guys.
- Vive la France!</i>

532
00:41:37,376 --> 00:41:41,340
Pardonnez moi, my pigeon friends.
You are the RHPS, non?

533
00:41:41,653 --> 00:41:42,800
Yes, sir.

534
00:41:43,321 --> 00:41:45,616
French Résistance, Mouse Division.

535
00:41:46,137 --> 00:41:49,996
Well, am I glad to see ya.
I'll tell ya. How did you not find us?

536
00:41:50,205 --> 00:41:52,864
Well, there was
the plane and the explosion.

537
00:41:52,865 --> 00:41:55,575
And the screaming, and the pleading.

538
00:41:55,576 --> 00:42:01,782
More screaming, the begging, the crying,
whining, whinging, yelling, boohooing...

539
00:42:01,783 --> 00:42:02,877
- And...
- Enough about that.

540
00:42:02,878 --> 00:42:04,755
- Absolutely.
- Definitely, definitely. Yeah.

541
00:42:05,016 --> 00:42:07,936
Ah... Allow me to introduce myself.

542
00:42:08,197 --> 00:42:10,074
I am Charles De Girl.

543
00:42:11,222 --> 00:42:13,725
De Girl? Why do they call you De Girl?

544
00:42:14,090 --> 00:42:18,461
Because I am a girl.
The one and only girl.

545
00:42:19,878 --> 00:42:22,226
- I like France.
- Do you speak French?

546
00:42:22,277 --> 00:42:27,648
- Well, mais oui...
- Does "o là là" mean anything to you?

547
00:42:27,649 --> 00:42:31,820
Or "va va voom!" Oh yeah!
Does bonjour...

548
00:42:31,821 --> 00:42:34,429
All right! We don't have time for this!

549
00:42:34,794 --> 00:42:36,880
You have a message, we have a mission.

550
00:42:36,932 --> 00:42:39,331
- Let's get on with it!
- Not so fast, monsieur!

551
00:42:39,696 --> 00:42:41,574
This is Rallo.

552
00:42:42,147 --> 00:42:44,128
He is an expert in sab...

553
00:42:46,058 --> 00:42:47,519
Sabotage.

554
00:42:47,987 --> 00:42:49,632
Sabotage!

555
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:54,955
Non, non, non. Rollo!

556
00:42:57,896 --> 00:42:59,252
Rollo, stop!

557
00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:04,676
Pardon.

558
00:43:05,911 --> 00:43:07,408
Now, monsieur, before you
continue on your mission,

559
00:43:08,728 --> 00:43:10,986
it is our national custom to...

560
00:43:11,091 --> 00:43:13,698
- Break the bread?
- And cut the cheese!

561
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:16,846
Thank you for your hospitality,
but we just don't have time to eat.

562
00:43:17,036 --> 00:43:18,861
And anyway we're birds...

563
00:43:19,174 --> 00:43:22,303
- We don't eat cheese.
- We don't?

564
00:43:22,616 --> 00:43:25,014
- Look, about that message.
- We will take you to it.

565
00:43:25,223 --> 00:43:29,549
But the road is dangerous.
And guarded by the enemy falcon.

566
00:43:31,064 --> 00:43:34,453
But this cannot be a problem for
such highly trained pigeons.

567
00:43:34,663 --> 00:43:36,957
That is why you are squad A, oui?

568
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,252
The thing is, you see...

569
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:41,546
- Squad B?
- Not squad B.

570
00:43:41,703 --> 00:43:42,954
Squad C?

571
00:43:44,424 --> 00:43:46,902
So then... you are squad D!

572
00:43:47,909 --> 00:43:52,075
Just between us, squad D was never
really all it was cracked up to be.

573
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:53,677
I will not lie to you...

574
00:43:53,906 --> 00:43:56,025
You will definitely be eaten the falcons.

575
00:43:59,225 --> 00:44:02,772
That was some fine fromage.

576
00:44:02,948 --> 00:44:05,952
- Can you burp on cue?
- Yeah.

577
00:44:05,953 --> 00:44:09,499
I can burp on all the letters,
not just Q. Watch this...

578
00:44:09,603 --> 00:44:12,836
A. B. C.

579
00:44:13,097 --> 00:44:14,975
Be silent!

580
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:16,695
The falcons!

581
00:44:21,442 --> 00:44:22,693
I say!

582
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:24,361
Excuse me.

583
00:44:41,728 --> 00:44:42,563
Come on.

584
00:44:48,768 --> 00:44:49,602
Falcons!

585
00:44:52,627 --> 00:44:53,513
All clear!

586
00:45:22,113 --> 00:45:23,156
Stop that!

587
00:45:25,471 --> 00:45:28,121
Squad F...

588
00:45:29,332 --> 00:45:31,626
- We are here.
- Well, this is invigorating.

589
00:45:32,157 --> 00:45:35,703
The attic! There it is!
Fly, English pigeons! Fly!

590
00:45:37,372 --> 00:45:40,605
- Dear. Sorry, girl.
- Dirty bird!

591
00:45:40,657 --> 00:45:44,204
Lofty pigeon at your service.
Hold on, mademoiselle.

592
00:45:46,134 --> 00:45:47,359
He's heavy, this one!

593
00:45:49,575 --> 00:45:50,618
There they are!

594
00:45:51,348 --> 00:45:52,391
Faster!

595
00:45:54,425 --> 00:45:57,033
Sabotage!

596
00:46:04,177 --> 00:46:05,429
To the right!

597
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:06,785
Over there!

598
00:46:06,993 --> 00:46:09,496
I am going to get you!

599
00:46:21,126 --> 00:46:22,169
Hold on, De Girl!

600
00:46:27,645 --> 00:46:28,688
This is it!

601
00:46:31,557 --> 00:46:34,059
I must do the secret knock.

602
00:46:36,354 --> 00:46:38,232
- Who is it?
- De Girl.

603
00:46:38,431 --> 00:46:41,775
- We must do the secret password.
- Jacques, there is no time!

604
00:46:41,986 --> 00:46:45,324
"Ba, ba, black sheep. Have you any?"

605
00:46:45,961 --> 00:46:47,004
Wine?

606
00:46:47,149 --> 00:46:49,131
No, no, that is yesterday's password.

607
00:46:49,391 --> 00:46:50,538
- Cheese?
- No.

608
00:46:50,643 --> 00:46:51,414
- Seeds?
- No, no, no.

609
00:46:51,582 --> 00:46:52,834
- Petunias?
- No.

610
00:46:52,938 --> 00:46:53,981
Falcons!

611
00:46:54,711 --> 00:46:55,545
Jacques!

612
00:47:06,706 --> 00:47:10,773
- Let me give you le message.
- You can give me "le massage".

613
00:47:10,981 --> 00:47:12,964
Can you make sure it's
a full body massage.

614
00:47:13,381 --> 00:47:16,614
Message! The message
that is to go to London.

615
00:47:16,979 --> 00:47:18,231
Our freedom depends on it.

616
00:47:22,924 --> 00:47:25,011
And... who will carry them?

617
00:47:28,348 --> 00:47:29,913
Wait. I'll take it.

618
00:47:30,278 --> 00:47:32,051
- Bugsy?
- Extraordinary!

619
00:47:32,729 --> 00:47:36,316
- And you said you weren't a team player.
- Well, we'll see now won't we?

620
00:47:36,327 --> 00:47:38,361
Good luck, Bugsy.
May you fly straight...

621
00:47:38,413 --> 00:47:40,500
And let our instincts guide us home.

622
00:47:47,018 --> 00:47:48,061
Pardon.

623
00:47:52,755 --> 00:47:55,362
Good bye. And good luck, pigeons!

624
00:48:04,958 --> 00:48:06,523
Okay, farewell.

625
00:48:08,712 --> 00:48:10,277
Absolutely charmed.

626
00:48:12,468 --> 00:48:15,179
Just... one tiny thing.

627
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:18,048
- How are we gonna get out of here!
- We're trapped!

628
00:48:20,342 --> 00:48:23,054
I've got an idea!
I've got an idea!

629
00:48:24,826 --> 00:48:26,391
Where are they?

630
00:48:44,644 --> 00:48:45,687
Let's go!

631
00:48:54,709 --> 00:48:57,420
- Hey, it worked like a charm!
- They'll be teaching that one

632
00:48:57,421 --> 00:48:59,507
- at the academy!
- I just hope the others are OK.

633
00:48:59,820 --> 00:49:01,488
Can't count on it!

634
00:49:02,428 --> 00:49:03,471
Evasive action!

635
00:49:20,993 --> 00:49:21,827
Let's go.

636
00:49:28,696 --> 00:49:30,259
Get your claws off him!

637
00:49:31,736 --> 00:49:34,864
I said let go!
I'm the one you want!

638
00:49:44,565 --> 00:49:47,694
You can do better than
that, you English pigeon!

639
00:49:49,310 --> 00:49:50,353
Bugsy!

640
00:50:03,183 --> 00:50:04,121
Bugsy!

641
00:50:06,259 --> 00:50:07,302
Dinner time!

642
00:50:24,981 --> 00:50:25,920
Bugsy!

643
00:50:30,927 --> 00:50:34,473
It was not easy, Herr General.
But I have...

644
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:38,958
captured their leader!

645
00:50:40,783 --> 00:50:41,617
Leader...

646
00:50:42,139 --> 00:50:44,642
Or, perhaps, assistant leader.

647
00:50:45,633 --> 00:50:49,857
- But more importantly, Herr General.
- Get on with it!

648
00:50:51,943 --> 00:50:54,029
May I present you with...

649
00:50:55,515 --> 00:50:57,809
The message! Tada.

650
00:51:03,729 --> 00:51:06,754
The high commander will be pleased!

651
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:16,558
There will be medals, photographs,
commemorative stamps!

652
00:51:18,748 --> 00:51:21,877
I will personally deliver it to him.

653
00:51:23,963 --> 00:51:32,307
They must be desperate indeed to give the
message to this putrid smelling reject.

654
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:40,443
Oh, no, Dennis! You've squished...
He was my favourite.

655
00:51:42,841 --> 00:51:44,406
I am... You're...
That's exactly what...

656
00:51:44,459 --> 00:51:48,631
I'm putrefied, stinky, rotten.
Eat me, you'll be sick for a week.

657
00:51:50,091 --> 00:51:53,011
- Take him away!
- No! No, listen, you can't...

658
00:51:53,950 --> 00:51:57,079
I've got a doctor's note.
I've got a feather condition!

659
00:51:58,852 --> 00:52:02,816
Wait! On second thought,
he may prove useful.

660
00:52:02,919 --> 00:52:04,797
Yeah! Oh, yes! Oh, yes. Yes.

661
00:52:08,396 --> 00:52:10,482
Thank you.
You're very wise.

662
00:52:10,690 --> 00:52:11,942
What do you like?

663
00:52:12,358 --> 00:52:14,444
Cards? We can play cards.

664
00:52:15,279 --> 00:52:17,365
Find the pebble?
I've got a lovely voice.

665
00:52:17,522 --> 00:52:20,390
<i>There'll be blue birds over...</i>

666
00:52:20,703 --> 00:52:23,623
<i>The white cliffs of... Dover.</i>

667
00:52:23,937 --> 00:52:26,179
That probably annoys you, you don't want
that one, that's... No, you don't want...

668
00:52:26,231 --> 00:52:30,195
I was thinking more along
the lines of a celebration dinner.

669
00:52:30,612 --> 00:52:33,219
Celebration dinner!
Brilliant idea! I cook well!

670
00:52:33,376 --> 00:52:35,305
Not I cook well! I won't be in it.

671
00:52:35,357 --> 00:52:37,652
I can make dinner.
Bread crumbs! You'll love...

672
00:52:37,808 --> 00:52:41,772
You haven't tried my bread
crumb... bird-seedy thing.

673
00:52:43,128 --> 00:52:46,779
No, pigeon under glass.

674
00:52:47,144 --> 00:52:50,846
With a lovely Liebfraumilch reduction.

675
00:53:04,718 --> 00:53:05,552
<i>...tickle.</i>

676
00:53:05,761 --> 00:53:07,221
What did you do to him?

677
00:53:13,218 --> 00:53:14,470
You're all right, mate?

678
00:53:16,081 --> 00:53:17,546
Wait a minute now!

679
00:53:17,547 --> 00:53:20,676
It's a feng-shui.
That little bell should be over there!

680
00:53:21,406 --> 00:53:23,492
Okay. Yeah, yeah.

681
00:53:27,038 --> 00:53:29,229
Who was I kidding?
I don't belong here.

682
00:53:30,793 --> 00:53:32,097
I've let everyone down.

683
00:53:33,296 --> 00:53:35,799
Bugsy wouldn't even be here
if it weren't for me.

684
00:53:39,658 --> 00:53:42,579
Chaps! There's Valiant! Look! Follow me!

685
00:53:42,996 --> 00:53:44,039
<i>- Valiant!
- Valiant!</i>

686
00:53:44,092 --> 00:53:49,202
- Hey! Lofty! Toughwood!
- You've made it!

687
00:53:53,061 --> 00:53:56,347
- Chaps!
- Gutsy! You're alive!

688
00:53:56,451 --> 00:53:58,015
What happened?
Tell us what happened!

689
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:00,519
Plane exploded. Chute gave out.

690
00:54:00,571 --> 00:54:03,961
Free fall of 3,000 feet.
Set upon by a pack of wolves.

691
00:54:04,169 --> 00:54:08,132
Flew through barbed wire, picked up
some shrapnel from a stray grenade.

692
00:54:08,216 --> 00:54:10,824
Fought my way to the rendezvous,
when, here we are.

693
00:54:11,053 --> 00:54:13,660
Right! We can dispense
with the chit chat.

694
00:54:13,974 --> 00:54:16,060
I'm guessing the falcons
have acquired the message.

695
00:54:16,581 --> 00:54:18,667
- Yes, sir.
- Where's Bugsy?

696
00:54:19,032 --> 00:54:23,830
He sacrificed himself to save me.
The falcons got Bugsy and the message.

697
00:54:23,986 --> 00:54:26,281
- Which way did they go?
- That way.

698
00:54:26,959 --> 00:54:28,471
Oh, no!

699
00:54:29,201 --> 00:54:31,027
<i>Rule Britannia,</i>

700
00:54:31,079 --> 00:54:33,373
<i>Britannia rules the waves.</i>

701
00:54:33,425 --> 00:54:35,459
<i>Britons, never, never, never,</i>

702
00:54:35,511 --> 00:54:37,441
<i>will be slaves.</i>

703
00:54:37,806 --> 00:54:39,474
<i>Rule Britannia...</i>

704
00:54:42,176 --> 00:54:45,201
Come on, pull yourself together.
Snap out of it!

705
00:54:48,236 --> 00:54:51,522
Come on Bugsy ol' boy,
let's find us a way out of here.

706
00:54:51,626 --> 00:54:53,503
Where there's a will, there's a way.

707
00:54:54,025 --> 00:54:55,902
Right. You chaps sit tight.

708
00:54:56,111 --> 00:55:00,804
I'll fly in, avoiding the various
clever booby traps and deadly ambushes.

709
00:55:00,909 --> 00:55:03,620
Then subdue any resistance.
And secure the message.

710
00:55:03,672 --> 00:55:06,801
- Absolutely.
- Gutsy by name. Gutsy by nature.

711
00:55:20,413 --> 00:55:21,874
I will bathe.

712
00:55:25,889 --> 00:55:28,497
- Bring me my best cape.
- Yes, Herr General.

713
00:55:45,578 --> 00:55:47,634
- Join the army you said. See the...
- I didn't say it.

714
00:55:47,635 --> 00:55:48,834
- You did.
- It was your idea.

715
00:55:48,835 --> 00:55:52,069
- It was your idea!
- ... Not listening! No, no.

716
00:55:55,301 --> 00:55:57,752
I'm afraid it's not as
simple as I thought.

717
00:55:57,804 --> 00:56:02,262
This is a highly fortified bunker stuffed
to the gills with enemy falcons.

718
00:56:02,551 --> 00:56:05,888
There's only one opening, scarcely
big enough for a hummingbird.

719
00:56:05,992 --> 00:56:08,078
It's down the barrel of that gun.

720
00:56:08,861 --> 00:56:12,512
No, gentlemen, I'm afraid it's hopeless.

721
00:56:20,855 --> 00:56:21,898
I'll do it!

722
00:56:22,472 --> 00:56:23,307
Valiant!

723
00:57:23,801 --> 00:57:24,844
Bugsy?

724
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:48,311
I'm too young to die!
I can't believe it!

725
00:57:48,364 --> 00:57:49,928
- Hey!
- Hey?

726
00:57:50,554 --> 00:57:52,431
- Valiant?
- Bugsy.

727
00:57:56,134 --> 00:57:59,784
Hey! The message!
It's in there.

728
00:58:10,736 --> 00:58:13,031
No, no! Red.

729
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:18,141
Red says strong and decisive!
Red it is!

730
00:58:18,246 --> 00:58:21,062
- Yes, Herr General!
- Yes, yes, yes. That's what I'm here for.

731
00:58:21,375 --> 00:58:27,945
- No, no, wait. The blue was the actual trim.
- As many capes as you like, General.

732
00:58:29,145 --> 00:58:30,396
They're coming!

733
00:58:32,169 --> 00:58:33,422
Valiant, get down!

734
00:58:44,999 --> 00:58:49,119
- How many capes does someone need?!
- I'm sick of capes, I hate capes...

735
00:59:00,905 --> 00:59:02,313
Here goes.

736
00:59:13,838 --> 00:59:18,010
- Now I'll get you out of here Bugs.
- It's no use, he took the key with him.

737
00:59:18,218 --> 00:59:21,244
- Complete the mission!
- But Bugsy, I can't!

738
00:59:21,296 --> 00:59:25,259
Valiant! Forget about me! You've got
the message, now get out of here!

739
00:59:25,415 --> 00:59:27,501
- No, Bugsy!
- Go.

740
00:59:34,229 --> 00:59:35,689
Don't! Don't do it!

741
00:59:49,508 --> 00:59:50,761
Underlingk?

742
00:59:52,325 --> 00:59:53,577
Underlingk!

743
00:59:54,359 --> 00:59:56,236
Ya, Herr General.

744
00:59:56,445 --> 00:59:58,322
My beak brush!

745
00:59:58,583 --> 01:00:00,669
Ya, Herr General.

746
01:00:02,859 --> 01:00:06,891
<i>Pin on my medals, pin on my medals...</i>

747
01:00:09,221 --> 01:00:10,891
<i>...on my cape.</i>

748
01:00:11,047 --> 01:00:12,299
Cufflingk?

749
01:00:12,559 --> 01:00:14,645
Ya, Herr General?

750
01:00:14,802 --> 01:00:18,974
- My talon clippers.
- Ya, Herr General!

751
01:00:25,284 --> 01:00:26,535
I am magnificent!

752
01:00:30,290 --> 01:00:32,168
Valiant! They're coming!

753
01:00:35,349 --> 01:00:37,435
- Get him!
- Stop him!

754
01:00:42,754 --> 01:00:44,215
What's going on!

755
01:00:44,267 --> 01:00:45,310
Bugsy!

756
01:00:45,988 --> 01:00:48,074
Oh, yes. Brilliant!

757
01:00:48,856 --> 01:00:52,089
Come on, last chance. Get up!
Come on, get up...

758
01:00:55,219 --> 01:00:58,138
What is that repulsive odor?!

759
01:00:58,921 --> 01:01:01,424
Not to rush you or anything,
we gotta go! Come on!

760
01:01:02,728 --> 01:01:03,980
Well done, my lad!

761
01:01:04,918 --> 01:01:08,465
- You're from Squad E, right?
- It's a long story, I'll tell you later!

762
01:01:20,042 --> 01:01:22,545
You idiots!

763
01:01:23,693 --> 01:01:26,822
Valiant! Bugsy! Mercury!

764
01:01:29,429 --> 01:01:31,724
- We did it!
- Valiant, you made it!

765
01:01:33,914 --> 01:01:37,564
- And... the message?
- Oh, yes, sir. Safe and sound.

766
01:01:37,982 --> 01:01:40,327
- Good man!
- Thank you, sir.

767
01:01:40,380 --> 01:01:43,301
Right lads, we have
a message to deliver.

768
01:01:44,292 --> 01:01:45,960
Let's make wind!

769
01:01:53,575 --> 01:01:57,955
Those falcons are gonna think
twice before they try to mess with us!

770
01:02:00,771 --> 01:02:01,971
Enemy fliers!

771
01:02:02,075 --> 01:02:04,787
Toughwood! Tailfeather! Figure of 8!

772
01:02:04,839 --> 01:02:06,716
- Disperse!
- Yes, sir!

773
01:02:14,487 --> 01:02:15,739
Well done!

774
01:02:18,190 --> 01:02:20,693
Come on lads, attack formation!

775
01:02:20,901 --> 01:02:24,448
Valiant, complete the mission!
You know where to go.

776
01:02:26,794 --> 01:02:28,359
Keep it tight now!

777
01:02:29,141 --> 01:02:30,601
Let's go chaps!

778
01:03:00,848 --> 01:03:05,020
You look tired, little bird.
Wouldn't you like a rest...

779
01:03:05,177 --> 01:03:06,845
In my belly?

780
01:03:08,515 --> 01:03:12,165
So... you are the elite?

781
01:03:12,582 --> 01:03:15,086
The best of the best?

782
01:03:15,816 --> 01:03:18,423
There's more to me than meets...
your eye.

783
01:03:53,259 --> 01:03:56,388
I hope I'm gonna make it.
I think I'm gonna make it.

784
01:03:56,597 --> 01:03:58,161
And I'm going to make it!

785
01:04:19,544 --> 01:04:23,194
You can't escape me, pigeon!

786
01:04:48,539 --> 01:04:55,006
<i>What do you do with a drunken sailor,
early in the morning...</i>

787
01:04:56,101 --> 01:05:01,837
Valiant, back so soon!
And alive! Excitable boy!

788
01:05:05,436 --> 01:05:06,270
What the...

789
01:05:06,374 --> 01:05:10,025
Falcon! Sound the alarm!

790
01:05:15,449 --> 01:05:17,743
Sound the alarm!

791
01:05:59,150 --> 01:06:04,887
It's just you and me now, pigeon!
This is where it ends.

792
01:06:05,252 --> 01:06:08,642
You are nothing but
a lowly roof pigeon.

793
01:06:08,746 --> 01:06:11,354
You are no match for a Falcon Royal.

794
01:06:18,081 --> 01:06:21,732
It's just as I imagined!
Pieces and shreds!

795
01:06:22,305 --> 01:06:23,557
Valiant!

796
01:06:29,294 --> 01:06:30,545
Come on, come on...

797
01:06:31,380 --> 01:06:35,552
- You great ugly...
- ...you dirty falcon!

798
01:07:02,305 --> 01:07:06,268
Come out, little birdy.

799
01:07:06,633 --> 01:07:10,806
I may even spare
your puny little life!

800
01:07:17,532 --> 01:07:20,661
Just stay calm.
You can do this!

801
01:07:36,098 --> 01:07:37,662
Pip-squeak!

802
01:07:38,340 --> 01:07:40,009
My name is not pip-squeak!

803
01:07:40,166 --> 01:07:42,043
My name is Valiant!

804
01:07:45,537 --> 01:07:47,623
- Valiant!
- Good lad!

805
01:07:48,509 --> 01:07:50,595
Now, if you'll excuse me,

806
01:07:51,222 --> 01:07:53,308
I have a message to deliver.

807
01:07:55,446 --> 01:07:56,697
That's my boy!

808
01:08:14,845 --> 01:08:16,931
Valiant? You've made it?

809
01:08:18,392 --> 01:08:19,852
Valiant pigeon.

810
01:08:20,687 --> 01:08:23,606
Sir, I have a message to deliver.

811
01:08:52,082 --> 01:08:57,035
Gentlemen, a change of plan.
We now land in Normandy.

812
01:09:04,389 --> 01:09:07,831
Well done, son.
This could mean promotion.

813
01:09:08,821 --> 01:09:11,325
I'm proud of you.
You're a credit to the service.

814
01:09:11,377 --> 01:09:13,984
Thank you. Thank you, sir.
It's been a... Sorry!

815
01:09:14,244 --> 01:09:15,497
Sorry, sorry, sorry...

816
01:09:15,705 --> 01:09:16,957
- Valiant!
- Well done ol' boy!

817
01:09:17,009 --> 01:09:20,972
- I knew you'd do it.
- You little beauty. Well done, mate.

818
01:09:22,276 --> 01:09:23,736
Seeds!

819
01:09:32,914 --> 01:09:35,210
Ahoy there, Valiant!

820
01:09:35,679 --> 01:09:38,286
Bug juice, on the house of course.

821
01:09:41,102 --> 01:09:44,961
- I'm the hero around here.
- No, no. I'm the hero. You wanna see...

822
01:09:45,014 --> 01:09:47,830
- Will you shut up?
- I was doing alright till you came over.

823
01:09:50,751 --> 01:09:54,713
- Hello, handsome!
- I say!

824
01:10:05,770 --> 01:10:08,064
- Shall we shake a tailfeather?
- Certainly!

825
01:10:08,168 --> 01:10:09,837
Sergeant!

826
01:10:11,194 --> 01:10:15,365
- Valiant, maybe you and I could...
- Sorry, but I'm not available.

827
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:21,728
But I can't stress enough
how available I am.
