1
00:02:10,346 --> 00:02:12,932
<i>When your father was a boy like you...</i>

2
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:15,351
<i>... living with me here in Norway...</i>

3
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:18,104
<i>... I told him about witches, too...</i>

4
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:20,440
<i>... so that he would always be aware.</i>

5
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:24,777
<i>The most important thing
you should know about...</i>

6
00:02:24,861 --> 00:02:27,071
<i>... real witches is this.</i>

7
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,157
<i>Listen very carefully.</i>

8
00:02:29,615 --> 00:02:33,077
<i>Real witches dress in ordinary clothes...</i>

9
00:02:33,161 --> 00:02:35,621
<i>... and look very much like ordinary women.</i>

10
00:02:35,955 --> 00:02:37,832
They live in ordinary houses...

11
00:02:37,915 --> 00:02:40,877
...and they work in ordinary jobs.

12
00:02:44,964 --> 00:02:47,925
Every country in the world has witches.

13
00:02:48,718 --> 00:02:50,803
And there is a leader...

14
00:02:51,721 --> 00:02:54,432
...a high witch of each country.

15
00:02:54,807 --> 00:02:56,184
And the ruler...

16
00:02:57,143 --> 00:02:58,936
...of all the witches...

17
00:02:59,145 --> 00:03:02,565
...is the most evil woman in creation.

18
00:03:03,024 --> 00:03:06,944
The Grand High Witch herself.

19
00:03:12,367 --> 00:03:16,412
Witches spend their time
plotting to kill children.

20
00:03:17,163 --> 00:03:19,916
Stalking the wretched child like a hunter...

21
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:21,959
...stalks a bird in the forest.

22
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:24,087
Did they hunt you?

23
00:03:30,426 --> 00:03:32,053
You said it was an accident.

24
00:03:32,136 --> 00:03:35,264
A very unpleasant accident.

25
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:38,142
When I was younger...

26
00:03:38,893 --> 00:03:42,146
...I traveled the world
in search for the Grand High Witch...

27
00:03:42,188 --> 00:03:43,940
...but I never found her.

28
00:03:44,065 --> 00:03:47,986
I don't really believe
that anyone has ever found her.

29
00:03:48,569 --> 00:03:50,822
If no one's seen the Grand High Witch...

30
00:03:50,905 --> 00:03:52,740
...how are you sure she exists?

31
00:03:53,116 --> 00:03:56,661
Nobody's ever seen the devil,
but we know he exists, don't we?

32
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:01,457
<i>For all you know,
a witch might be living next door to you.</i>

33
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:04,919
<i>When I was little...</i>

34
00:04:05,003 --> 00:04:07,672
<i>... I lived beside a girl called Erica...</i>

35
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,174
<i>... who was taken by a witch.</i>

36
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:13,636
<i>Erica had very strict parents.</i>

37
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:16,848
<i>But even that didn't save poor Erica...</i>

38
00:04:17,056 --> 00:04:19,642
<i>... because when a witch chooses a victim...</i>

39
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:22,562
<i>... there is only one hope of escape:</i>

40
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:26,941
<i>Knowing everything about them
that I am telling you.</i>

41
00:04:27,317 --> 00:04:28,818
<i>I'm warning you!</i>

42
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:31,487
Erica, come in.

43
00:04:32,196 --> 00:04:36,117
<i>What makes her dangerous is the fact
that she doesn't look dangerous.</i>

44
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:39,746
<i>You can never be sure
if it's a witch you're looking at...</i>

45
00:04:39,871 --> 00:04:41,539
<i>... or a kind lady.</i>

46
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:46,711
Erica!

47
00:04:48,338 --> 00:04:50,048
How do you like my new painting?

48
00:04:50,131 --> 00:04:51,716
<i>It's magnifique, Papa.</i>

49
00:04:52,717 --> 00:04:54,052
Go to Larsen's...

50
00:04:54,802 --> 00:04:57,263
...and buy a liter of milk.

51
00:04:57,805 --> 00:04:58,890
Yes, Papa.

52
00:05:02,477 --> 00:05:03,811
Come straight home.

53
00:05:05,396 --> 00:05:08,358
<i>Real witches hate children.</i>

54
00:05:12,737 --> 00:05:15,782
Real witches are quite bald.

55
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:18,326
Although, of course, they wear wigs...

56
00:05:18,701 --> 00:05:19,952
...that itch...

57
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,955
...and cause them scalp rash.

58
00:05:23,247 --> 00:05:24,957
Do you know what scalp rash is?

59
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:25,917
No.

60
00:05:26,376 --> 00:05:30,254
Itching under the wig.
Must drive them crazy.

61
00:05:31,422 --> 00:05:36,260
They look quite hideous
behind their human facemasks.

62
00:05:36,678 --> 00:05:40,223
<i>They can only be distinguished
from ordinary women...</i>

63
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:45,061
<i>... if you are sharp enough
to spot the purple tinge to their eyes.</i>

64
00:05:46,771 --> 00:05:50,233
<i>Real witches have no toes.</i>

65
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:53,152
<i>Their feet have square ends...</i>

66
00:05:53,236 --> 00:05:57,031
<i>... revolting stumps
where their toes should be.</i>

67
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:00,702
<i>So they never wear pointed
or pretty shoes.</i>

68
00:06:00,785 --> 00:06:03,997
<i>Just plain, sensible shoes.</i>

69
00:06:04,789 --> 00:06:07,542
<i>Remember these things.</i>

70
00:06:08,876 --> 00:06:11,754
<i>Perhaps if Erica had known them...</i>

71
00:06:26,644 --> 00:06:28,479
<i>My poor Erica.</i>

72
00:06:29,147 --> 00:06:31,607
<i>For weeks they searched.</i>

73
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:36,029
<i>But witches don't murder children
with knives or guns.</i>

74
00:06:36,112 --> 00:06:38,281
<i>That's for people who get caught.</i>

75
00:06:38,406 --> 00:06:41,242
<i>And witches never get caught.</i>

76
00:06:42,785 --> 00:06:45,079
<i>They searched for miles around.</i>

77
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:47,874
<i>Everyone in the town searched...</i>

78
00:06:47,999 --> 00:06:51,836
<i>... but she had completely disappeared.</i>

79
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:02,472
<i>I was there in Erica's house
six weeks later.</i>

80
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,390
<i>Good day, Frau Larsen.</i>

81
00:07:04,474 --> 00:07:06,476
Come in, Helga. Have some cake.

82
00:07:06,768 --> 00:07:09,312
<i>I was her best friend when it happened.</i>

83
00:07:10,813 --> 00:07:12,315
<i>Then, that day...</i>

84
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:15,943
<i>... while Erica's mother
was pouring the coffee...</i>

85
00:07:16,361 --> 00:07:19,030
<i>... her father came walking towards us.</i>

86
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:23,034
<i>It was as though he had seen a ghost.</i>

87
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:25,036
<i>His face was all twisted up...</i>

88
00:07:25,119 --> 00:07:27,872
<i>... as he walked towards the painting
behind me.</i>

89
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:32,794
<i>There, as if it always had been there...</i>

90
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:34,796
<i>... was Erica...</i>

91
00:07:35,088 --> 00:07:37,340
<i>... locked in the painting...</i>

92
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:39,884
<i>... gazing at us.</i>

93
00:07:40,551 --> 00:07:42,261
<i>Papa...</i>

94
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,934
I don't believe it.
You saw her in the painting, Grandma?

95
00:07:48,017 --> 00:07:49,602
Many times.

96
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:53,189
But the peculiar thing
was that little Erica...

97
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:56,651
...kept changing her position in the picture.

98
00:07:57,193 --> 00:07:59,112
One day she'd be feeding the ducks.

99
00:07:59,195 --> 00:08:01,823
The next day,
she'd be inside the farmhouse...

100
00:08:02,115 --> 00:08:03,908
...Iooking out of a window.

101
00:08:03,992 --> 00:08:06,244
Did you see her moving in the picture?

102
00:08:06,369 --> 00:08:08,371
Nobody did.

103
00:08:08,705 --> 00:08:11,416
She was always just a figure...

104
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:14,043
<i>... motionless in the painting.</i>

105
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:19,465
<i>As the years went by,
Erica grew older, too.</i>

106
00:08:21,134 --> 00:08:23,928
And only five or six years ago...

107
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:26,764
...the old woman that Erica had become...

108
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:29,809
...bent and frail in the painting...

109
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:32,937
...began to disappear.

110
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:34,897
Until...

111
00:08:35,565 --> 00:08:38,067
...one morning, she was gone.

112
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:40,403
She died?

113
00:08:40,695 --> 00:08:41,779
Who knows?

114
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,408
Mysterious things go on
in the world of witches.

115
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,620
It's almost 9:00.

116
00:08:49,704 --> 00:08:52,081
Grandma's been telling me
about witches, Mom.

117
00:08:52,165 --> 00:08:55,209
And frightening you before you go to sleep.

118
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:57,628
Good night, darling.

119
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:58,921
Everything all right?

120
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:00,298
Very all right.

121
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,841
Go on. Enjoy yourselves.

122
00:09:01,924 --> 00:09:03,176
Good-bye, Mom.

123
00:09:04,135 --> 00:09:05,303
Here you go.

124
00:09:06,512 --> 00:09:08,806
- Good night, son.
- Good night, Dad.

125
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:10,475
No more stories, okay?

126
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:13,061
Oh, no.

127
00:09:39,253 --> 00:09:41,464
Come on, just one more story.

128
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:44,884
All right, one more. But very short.

129
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,429
Witches...

130
00:09:48,846 --> 00:09:50,807
...are very cruel.

131
00:09:51,307 --> 00:09:55,186
They have a highly developed sense
of smell.

132
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:58,898
A real witch could smell you
across the street...

133
00:09:58,982 --> 00:10:00,817
...on a pitch-black night.

134
00:10:01,109 --> 00:10:03,277
Not me. I just had a shower.

135
00:10:03,403 --> 00:10:04,696
Yes, she could.

136
00:10:04,946 --> 00:10:07,865
The cleaner you are,
the more a witch can smell you.

137
00:10:08,032 --> 00:10:09,617
That doesn't make sense.

138
00:10:09,701 --> 00:10:11,119
Yes, it does.

139
00:10:11,369 --> 00:10:14,497
A dirty child, it's the dirt she smells.

140
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,874
A clean child, it is the child.

141
00:10:20,503 --> 00:10:24,215
I'll never have a shower again,
and I'll have you for an excuse.

142
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:26,342
Well, just not too often.

143
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:29,387
Only once a month is probably safe.

144
00:10:29,595 --> 00:10:32,056
So a witch could smell me right now?

145
00:10:32,307 --> 00:10:35,268
To me, you smell of raspberries
and cream...

146
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:39,647
...but to a witch, you would smell
absolutely disgusting.

147
00:10:40,398 --> 00:10:42,400
What kind of disgusting?

148
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:45,361
Like dog's droppings.

149
00:10:46,195 --> 00:10:47,613
I don't believe it.

150
00:10:47,697 --> 00:10:49,198
You don't believe it?

151
00:10:49,699 --> 00:10:54,203
What's more, to a witch,
you'd smell of fresh dog's droppings.

152
00:10:54,287 --> 00:10:55,413
That's not true.

153
00:10:55,455 --> 00:10:57,915
There's no point in arguing.
It's a fact of life.

154
00:10:58,666 --> 00:11:02,920
So, if you see a woman holding her nose
as she passes you...

155
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:04,922
...she could easily be a witch.

156
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:08,551
And now it is definitely bedtime.

157
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:12,263
Good night, Grandma.

158
00:11:48,091 --> 00:11:49,050
Mom?

159
00:11:50,677 --> 00:11:51,678
Dad?

160
00:12:26,629 --> 00:12:29,048
<i>Frau Evershim,
could I come in for a minute?</i>

161
00:12:29,716 --> 00:12:31,718
I'm afraid I have some bad news.

162
00:12:32,093 --> 00:12:33,511
Come in.

163
00:12:34,178 --> 00:12:35,263
Wait here.

164
00:12:56,743 --> 00:12:58,244
Come here to me.

165
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:00,079
Come on.

166
00:13:00,747 --> 00:13:02,498
Let's cuddle up here.

167
00:13:02,707 --> 00:13:04,500
Sit on my lap.

168
00:13:25,647 --> 00:13:27,899
- Shall we bring them to England?
- Yes.

169
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:31,110
Let's do that. I think they're very good.

170
00:13:31,778 --> 00:13:33,154
I really do.

171
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:37,241
Quite a talent there,
which I didn't know anything about.

172
00:13:40,703 --> 00:13:41,663
Thanks.

173
00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:55,718
<i>After the accident...</i>

174
00:13:55,969 --> 00:13:59,889
<i>... I didn't take Luke
back to America right away.</i>

175
00:14:00,348 --> 00:14:02,642
<i>We went to England where I had a house.</i>

176
00:14:02,809 --> 00:14:06,604
<i>He started at the school his parents
had chosen for him before they...</i>

177
00:14:06,688 --> 00:14:09,023
- Bald?
- That's why they wear wigs.

178
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:11,442
<i>Before they came to me on their vacation.</i>

179
00:14:11,526 --> 00:14:12,777
They itch and scratch a lot.

180
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:15,279
I saw a woman yesterday with purple eyes.

181
00:14:33,464 --> 00:14:34,799
Hello, young man.

182
00:14:35,758 --> 00:14:38,177
What a magnificent tree house.

183
00:14:38,678 --> 00:14:40,430
Did you build it yourself?

184
00:14:40,596 --> 00:14:42,056
My dad and I did.

185
00:14:44,475 --> 00:14:46,436
I've got something for you here.

186
00:14:47,645 --> 00:14:49,814
Something I think you'll like.

187
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:52,525
- Jump down and I'll show you.
- No.

188
00:14:52,608 --> 00:14:54,944
- What?
- No, thank you very much.

189
00:14:55,069 --> 00:14:57,322
It's worth a lot of money.

190
00:14:58,031 --> 00:14:59,449
This is private property.

191
00:14:59,532 --> 00:15:01,242
There's nothing to be frightened of.

192
00:15:01,326 --> 00:15:03,411
I just wanted to give you this.

193
00:15:04,912 --> 00:15:08,333
I found him on my walk.
He's quite harmless.

194
00:15:10,251 --> 00:15:11,127
See?

195
00:15:12,253 --> 00:15:14,213
Little boys love snakes.

196
00:15:16,424 --> 00:15:18,009
Here, he's yours.

197
00:15:18,676 --> 00:15:20,678
Grandma! Grandma!

198
00:15:20,803 --> 00:15:24,182
I'll leave him here if you like.
Then you can come down and get him.

199
00:15:25,433 --> 00:15:27,560
They wriggle away quite quickly...

200
00:15:28,561 --> 00:15:31,356
...unless you tell them not to.

201
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:38,404
Grandma!

202
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:42,533
Perhaps you'd like some chocolate.

203
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:45,995
Grandma!

204
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,706
She can't hear you.

205
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:51,751
What's your name?

206
00:15:51,918 --> 00:15:52,877
Is it...

207
00:15:54,587 --> 00:15:55,630
...Luke?

208
00:15:56,589 --> 00:15:57,674
Thought so.

209
00:15:58,091 --> 00:16:00,051
Here you are, Luke.

210
00:16:00,593 --> 00:16:04,514
A big bar of chocolate.

211
00:16:05,098 --> 00:16:06,808
- If you...
- Luke.

212
00:16:08,101 --> 00:16:09,727
Luke, it's dinnertime.

213
00:16:18,361 --> 00:16:20,446
Luke, dinnertime.

214
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:30,164
- Did you see her?
- Yes.

215
00:16:30,873 --> 00:16:33,543
I think she was a witch.
Gloves, purple eyes.

216
00:16:33,626 --> 00:16:35,503
She wanted me to climb down and...

217
00:16:35,586 --> 00:16:37,714
...she hypnotized a snake
she wanted to give me.

218
00:16:37,797 --> 00:16:39,257
A real one?

219
00:16:39,382 --> 00:16:40,883
A real snake, yes!

220
00:16:44,929 --> 00:16:46,014
I swear.

221
00:16:48,641 --> 00:16:49,934
I believe you.

222
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:05,283
Close your eyes. No cheating.

223
00:17:05,366 --> 00:17:07,493
To your chair. There we are.

224
00:17:07,577 --> 00:17:10,163
"Happy birthday to you

225
00:17:10,371 --> 00:17:12,790
"Happy birthday to you

226
00:17:12,957 --> 00:17:15,793
"Happy birthday, dear Luke

227
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,712
"Happy birthday to you"

228
00:17:17,795 --> 00:17:19,005
There!

229
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:20,798
They're great!

230
00:17:21,591 --> 00:17:23,384
I'll build them a whole circus...

231
00:17:23,468 --> 00:17:26,346
...teach them tricks
and acrobatics and stuff.

232
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:28,848
It must be so neat being a mouse.

233
00:17:28,931 --> 00:17:32,810
<i>Just play all day and eat,
and then play some more.</i>

234
00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:35,813
I'll rig up a whole room with...

235
00:17:37,398 --> 00:17:38,941
Grandma!

236
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:41,819
Grandma!

237
00:17:44,739 --> 00:17:47,992
Your granny has a mild case of diabetes.

238
00:17:48,117 --> 00:17:49,827
It's nothing to worry about.

239
00:17:49,911 --> 00:17:53,289
Have a good rest,
and soon you'll be as right as rain.

240
00:17:53,373 --> 00:17:54,707
You'll be better.

241
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:57,168
I'm putting you on a sugar-free diet.

242
00:17:57,251 --> 00:18:00,546
No cakes, candies, or sugar at all.

243
00:18:01,422 --> 00:18:03,508
Those cigars won't do you any good.

244
00:18:03,591 --> 00:18:04,258
See?

245
00:18:04,342 --> 00:18:06,219
There are some more pills to take.

246
00:18:06,427 --> 00:18:08,846
With that and a good holiday
by the seaside...

247
00:18:09,013 --> 00:18:10,723
...you'll be good as new.

248
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:14,310
Come on, leave your granny to rest.

249
00:18:14,394 --> 00:18:17,647
Perhaps you can bring her breakfast in bed
in the morning.

250
00:18:18,231 --> 00:18:21,651
By tomorrow afternoon,
you can boss her around like before.

251
00:18:21,734 --> 00:18:23,695
- Bye-bye, Mrs. Evershim.
- Bye-bye.

252
00:18:23,778 --> 00:18:25,613
See you in a couple of days.

253
00:18:26,656 --> 00:18:28,282
- Can you find your way?
- Yes.

254
00:18:28,366 --> 00:18:31,327
How come doctors speak to everybody
like they're babies?

255
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:32,662
I know.

256
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:36,374
I'm sorry for spoiling your birthday...

257
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:38,543
...and for giving you a fright.

258
00:18:39,627 --> 00:18:42,547
Is it all right if I play
with William and Mary now?

259
00:18:42,672 --> 00:18:43,965
Yes, of course.

260
00:19:02,317 --> 00:19:04,736
Listen, Mary Mouse,
when Grandma gets better...

261
00:19:04,777 --> 00:19:07,613
...we're going with her to a hotel
by the ocean.

262
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,741
You've never been to the ocean.

263
00:19:10,033 --> 00:19:11,034
I'll tell you, it's big.

264
00:19:21,753 --> 00:19:23,588
Look at the hotel, Grandma.

265
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,298
It's not half bad.

266
00:19:38,478 --> 00:19:40,271
- Welcome, madam.
- Thank you.

267
00:19:40,355 --> 00:19:42,315
Think it'll be a nice day, yes?

268
00:19:42,565 --> 00:19:44,067
Can you manage, Luke?

269
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:05,964
Come on, Luke. There we go.

270
00:20:11,344 --> 00:20:13,930
Welcome to the Excelsior! Nicola Cole.

271
00:20:14,013 --> 00:20:15,556
I've looked forward to meeting you.

272
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,975
You look marvelous.

273
00:20:17,058 --> 00:20:19,227
Wish I could say the same for you.

274
00:20:20,728 --> 00:20:23,481
Miss Ernst. I am the owner of the hotel.

275
00:20:24,899 --> 00:20:26,943
We're very happy to have you here.

276
00:20:27,026 --> 00:20:29,320
Delighted. Should I sign or something?

277
00:20:29,487 --> 00:20:31,030
This is my secretary.

278
00:20:31,864 --> 00:20:33,616
Yes. How are you?

279
00:20:33,866 --> 00:20:35,201
Ladies.

280
00:20:36,035 --> 00:20:37,787
- Ina Clay Beckman.
- Indeed.

281
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:39,455
<i>Julia Whitman.</i>

282
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:42,250
<i>Julia. Yes. Where are you from?</i>

283
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:43,626
Darlington.

284
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:46,504
- Lois Leffour, from Southampton.
- Lois.

285
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,477
In there, that must be where you sleep.

286
00:21:03,062 --> 00:21:06,024
The carpetbag on the bed, please.

287
00:21:06,607 --> 00:21:10,194
I'll have a wash and brush-up
while you explore the place.

288
00:21:10,403 --> 00:21:13,031
Then we shall have tea together...

289
00:21:13,281 --> 00:21:15,700
...and you'll show me around, yes?

290
00:21:15,783 --> 00:21:16,826
Thank you.

291
00:21:16,909 --> 00:21:18,286
Don't lock me out.

292
00:21:18,369 --> 00:21:20,204
I promise I won't.

293
00:21:30,715 --> 00:21:32,717
You look wonderful, Miss Ernst.

294
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,762
We are looking forward to this afternoon.

295
00:22:15,134 --> 00:22:16,636
What are you doing?

296
00:22:17,387 --> 00:22:20,181
The raisins are all around the edge
of these cakes.

297
00:22:20,264 --> 00:22:21,724
They're really good.

298
00:22:21,975 --> 00:22:22,976
Thanks.

299
00:22:25,103 --> 00:22:26,396
My name's Luke.

300
00:22:28,231 --> 00:22:29,941
Bruno Jenkins.

301
00:22:30,316 --> 00:22:32,819
The cucumber sandwiches
are all right, too...

302
00:22:32,902 --> 00:22:35,822
...except when they use margarine
instead of butter.

303
00:22:36,239 --> 00:22:38,449
How much pocket money do you get?

304
00:22:38,574 --> 00:22:41,744
My dad's rich, but he's very tight.

305
00:22:41,911 --> 00:22:43,454
We've got three cars.

306
00:22:43,538 --> 00:22:44,706
Hello, boys.

307
00:22:44,831 --> 00:22:47,542
I hope there's butter
in the sandwiches today.

308
00:22:47,625 --> 00:22:50,211
I really do hate margarine.

309
00:22:51,087 --> 00:22:53,464
You've got those excellent cakes again.

310
00:22:53,548 --> 00:22:55,341
<i>There should be 14 of the...</i>

311
00:22:57,093 --> 00:22:58,469
Mr. Stringer!

312
00:23:00,972 --> 00:23:04,434
- What happened?
- I went to make the bed. They were there.

313
00:23:04,517 --> 00:23:07,312
- What?
- White and disgusting.

314
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:10,356
Calm down.

315
00:23:23,369 --> 00:23:25,455
Is this your room?

316
00:23:25,747 --> 00:23:26,873
Yes.

317
00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:32,253
I'm sorry, madam,
but I cannot permit mice in my hotel.

318
00:23:32,337 --> 00:23:34,505
How dare you say that
when your rotten hotel...

319
00:23:34,547 --> 00:23:36,507
...is full of rats anyway?

320
00:23:36,549 --> 00:23:37,800
Rats?

321
00:23:38,468 --> 00:23:40,219
There are no rats in this hotel.

322
00:23:40,303 --> 00:23:43,973
I saw one this morning running
along the corridor into the kitchen.

323
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:48,853
Madam, you only arrived in the hotel
this afternoon.

324
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,355
Morning, afternoon.

325
00:23:50,396 --> 00:23:52,690
I saw a rat in your hotel...

326
00:23:52,774 --> 00:23:55,026
...and if matters do not improve...

327
00:23:55,109 --> 00:23:58,571
...I'll have to report you
to the public health authorities.

328
00:24:00,865 --> 00:24:03,117
Look, madam, I'm not prepared...

329
00:24:03,201 --> 00:24:06,788
The cakes in the lounge are nibbled
all around the edges. I can show you.

330
00:24:06,871 --> 00:24:08,122
If you're not careful...

331
00:24:08,206 --> 00:24:10,959
...the health people
will order the whole hotel closed...

332
00:24:11,042 --> 00:24:13,711
...before everyone gets typhoid fever.

333
00:24:13,795 --> 00:24:15,713
You can't be serious, madam.

334
00:24:15,838 --> 00:24:18,216
I've never been more serious in my life.

335
00:24:18,299 --> 00:24:22,387
Now, will you or will you not
let my grandchild...

336
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:26,432
...keep his hygienic
and perfectly harmless pet mice?

337
00:24:33,439 --> 00:24:36,484
If they are kept in the cage,
and only in this room.

338
00:24:36,567 --> 00:24:38,236
Nowhere else in the hotel!

339
00:24:38,277 --> 00:24:39,445
Agreed.

340
00:24:40,363 --> 00:24:41,447
Very well.

341
00:24:50,415 --> 00:24:51,499
Grandma...

342
00:24:51,582 --> 00:24:54,168
...I can't train my mice if they're in a cage.

343
00:24:54,252 --> 00:24:56,671
Nibbled cakes, indeed.

344
00:24:56,879 --> 00:25:00,591
There were,
only it was a boy called Bruno Jenkins.

345
00:25:00,717 --> 00:25:04,887
I'm teaching William and Mary
how to be tightrope walkers.

346
00:25:04,971 --> 00:25:07,557
I brought the circus I'm building with me.

347
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,017
Good. Show me.

348
00:25:12,687 --> 00:25:13,730
Let's see.

349
00:25:13,813 --> 00:25:16,316
Look. I'm planning them a major house.

350
00:25:16,399 --> 00:25:20,403
Ramp ways here, a bathtub.
This elevator's pretty neat.

351
00:25:20,486 --> 00:25:24,949
You really did this yourself?
It's good. I'm impressed.

352
00:25:25,074 --> 00:25:26,659
You must train your mice...

353
00:25:26,743 --> 00:25:29,579
...but you mustn't get caught
or do it in here...

354
00:25:29,662 --> 00:25:32,457
...because if that hysterical maid
comes back...

355
00:25:34,292 --> 00:25:35,752
Now it's teatime.

356
00:25:35,835 --> 00:25:39,464
I just love English hotel teas.

357
00:25:39,589 --> 00:25:42,091
Cream cakes and shortbread and...

358
00:25:42,258 --> 00:25:43,468
No, Grandma.

359
00:25:43,509 --> 00:25:45,303
No cream cakes.

360
00:25:45,428 --> 00:25:47,805
And no shortbread, either.
It's full of sugar.

361
00:25:47,889 --> 00:25:50,600
I shall end up eating the same diet
as your mice.

362
00:25:51,309 --> 00:25:54,312
That's the trouble with this country:
A queue for everything.

363
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,648
They wouldn't think to have
two tea trolleys.

364
00:25:56,731 --> 00:25:59,609
No, that'd be too convenient
for the paying guests.

365
00:25:59,859 --> 00:26:02,820
They'll want two lumps of ice
in their whiskey next.

366
00:26:03,029 --> 00:26:05,865
They'd queue for their own funerals
if they could.

367
00:26:06,449 --> 00:26:09,160
I know that woman from somewhere...

368
00:26:09,702 --> 00:26:12,497
...but I can't for the life of me
remember where.

369
00:26:14,457 --> 00:26:16,960
Her face is so familiar.

370
00:26:18,211 --> 00:26:19,504
Which one?

371
00:26:19,712 --> 00:26:21,506
My memory's going.

372
00:26:21,547 --> 00:26:23,967
But it's as if I met her before.

373
00:26:24,509 --> 00:26:26,594
She's probably on TV or something.

374
00:26:27,303 --> 00:26:29,305
Cucumber sandwiches.

375
00:26:32,225 --> 00:26:34,018
Fish paste.

376
00:26:34,102 --> 00:26:35,895
You got the wrong one.

377
00:26:37,105 --> 00:26:39,315
Oh, no. Sugar.

378
00:26:39,565 --> 00:26:41,484
Sugar can kill you.

379
00:26:41,567 --> 00:26:44,570
I know, but it was very little.

380
00:26:45,571 --> 00:26:48,324
Something very odd is going on.

381
00:26:48,408 --> 00:26:49,826
Are you listening to me?

382
00:26:49,909 --> 00:26:52,996
You'll have some fresh air
if I have to take you out by your ear.

383
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:57,041
We didn't come here for you to sit eating
and watch telly all day.

384
00:26:57,375 --> 00:27:00,295
All the other boys are out there
playing in the water.

385
00:27:00,378 --> 00:27:01,796
Pick up your knife.

386
00:27:01,879 --> 00:27:03,756
You're just like your father.

387
00:27:09,887 --> 00:27:11,472
Good afternoon, madam.

388
00:27:13,933 --> 00:27:14,767
Go on.

389
00:27:14,851 --> 00:27:16,769
Are you sure you're all right?

390
00:27:17,562 --> 00:27:18,771
Fine, fine.

391
00:27:20,064 --> 00:27:22,025
What are you going to do now?

392
00:27:22,108 --> 00:27:25,153
I'm gonna take William and Mary
and explore this place.

393
00:27:25,236 --> 00:27:28,031
<i>Just don't get into trouble, will you?</i>

394
00:27:28,114 --> 00:27:29,073
I won't.

395
00:27:29,115 --> 00:27:30,241
Come on.

396
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,623
Excuse me, please.

397
00:27:40,293 --> 00:27:41,711
That's fine.

398
00:27:43,463 --> 00:27:45,256
Carry on with the rest of them.

399
00:27:45,298 --> 00:27:47,300
No. In the kitchen.

400
00:28:40,353 --> 00:28:41,479
Wait there.

401
00:28:57,704 --> 00:28:59,580
Great. Now do it again.

402
00:29:01,541 --> 00:29:02,792
Come on.

403
00:29:02,875 --> 00:29:06,087
I'm sure your delegates
will be comfortable in here.

404
00:29:06,379 --> 00:29:08,506
If there's anything we can do...

405
00:29:08,673 --> 00:29:10,550
Come on, Nicola, down the front!

406
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:15,847
Drinks will be served on the terrace after...

407
00:29:16,764 --> 00:29:18,599
...you've concluded your meeting.

408
00:29:18,683 --> 00:29:20,852
Skies are clearing, I'm glad to say.

409
00:29:21,436 --> 00:29:22,478
Sit down.

410
00:29:22,562 --> 00:29:25,189
We've prepared a fine meal for you tonight.

411
00:29:25,231 --> 00:29:27,108
The chef's special soup...

412
00:29:35,116 --> 00:29:36,534
Look at her eyes.

413
00:29:39,912 --> 00:29:41,414
I'll leave you to business.

414
00:29:41,456 --> 00:29:42,832
Fine. Thank you.

415
00:29:43,666 --> 00:29:45,460
Everybody sitting?

416
00:29:45,835 --> 00:29:47,253
Up front, sit down!

417
00:29:47,337 --> 00:29:49,714
Not yet!

418
00:29:50,173 --> 00:29:51,382
We've got to get out of here.

419
00:29:51,466 --> 00:29:52,759
Come along, ladies.

420
00:29:52,842 --> 00:29:55,428
The sooner you're ready,
the sooner we can start.

421
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:59,724
Thank you for letting me stay.

422
00:29:59,766 --> 00:30:02,518
- That's all right, Elsie.
- I'll lock up.

423
00:30:02,602 --> 00:30:03,603
- Good.
- Good.

424
00:30:03,686 --> 00:30:05,063
Then we'll begin.

425
00:30:34,801 --> 00:30:37,762
You may remove your shoes.

426
00:30:41,808 --> 00:30:44,227
You may remove your wigs.

427
00:30:45,561 --> 00:30:48,564
The doors, are they locked and bolted?

428
00:30:49,857 --> 00:30:51,901
Locked and bolted, Your Grandness.

429
00:30:51,985 --> 00:30:53,444
Good. Help me.

430
00:31:17,427 --> 00:31:20,221
Witches of England...

431
00:31:21,848 --> 00:31:24,392
...you're a disgrace!

432
00:31:25,643 --> 00:31:27,478
Miserable witches...

433
00:31:28,521 --> 00:31:31,983
...you are good-for-nothing worms!

434
00:31:33,192 --> 00:31:35,111
Everywhere I look...

435
00:31:37,947 --> 00:31:40,450
...I see the repulsive sight...

436
00:31:40,783 --> 00:31:42,327
...of hundreds...

437
00:31:43,369 --> 00:31:45,246
...thousands...

438
00:31:45,872 --> 00:31:47,915
...of revolting little children.

439
00:31:50,918 --> 00:31:52,295
I ask you:

440
00:31:53,546 --> 00:31:54,505
Why?

441
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,428
One child a week is no good to me.

442
00:32:01,387 --> 00:32:02,722
We will do better.

443
00:32:02,889 --> 00:32:04,891
We will do much better.

444
00:32:05,558 --> 00:32:08,603
Better is no good, either!

445
00:32:10,021 --> 00:32:14,192
I demand maximum results.

446
00:32:15,234 --> 00:32:16,444
So...

447
00:32:17,612 --> 00:32:20,156
...here are my orders.

448
00:32:21,532 --> 00:32:23,576
My orders are...

449
00:32:24,494 --> 00:32:26,371
...that every child...

450
00:32:27,246 --> 00:32:28,623
...in England...

451
00:32:29,374 --> 00:32:31,334
...shall be rubbed out.

452
00:32:32,085 --> 00:32:33,419
Destroyed!

453
00:32:34,921 --> 00:32:37,590
Every single child eliminated!

454
00:32:39,258 --> 00:32:42,512
Do I make myself clear?

455
00:32:47,058 --> 00:32:49,352
We can't possibly wipe out all of them.

456
00:32:51,187 --> 00:32:52,355
Who spoke?

457
00:32:55,191 --> 00:32:57,402
Who dares to argue with me?

458
00:33:00,947 --> 00:33:02,365
It was you?

459
00:33:02,824 --> 00:33:04,283
I didn't mean to argue.

460
00:33:04,367 --> 00:33:07,203
You dare to argue with me?

461
00:33:07,287 --> 00:33:09,622
No, honestly. It just was a...

462
00:33:10,123 --> 00:33:13,376
A stupid witch who answers back...

463
00:33:13,584 --> 00:33:16,129
...must burn until her bones are black!

464
00:33:16,254 --> 00:33:17,213
No.

465
00:33:17,338 --> 00:33:18,881
A foolish witch...

466
00:33:19,632 --> 00:33:21,134
...without a brain...

467
00:33:21,759 --> 00:33:24,429
...must sizzle into fiery flame!

468
00:33:25,305 --> 00:33:26,472
A witch...

469
00:33:26,764 --> 00:33:29,267
...who dares to say I'm wrong...

470
00:33:30,601 --> 00:33:33,062
...will not be with us...

471
00:33:33,313 --> 00:33:34,564
...very long!

472
00:33:37,859 --> 00:33:39,402
What the devil?

473
00:33:56,502 --> 00:34:01,257
I hope nobody else
is going to make me cross today.

474
00:34:05,053 --> 00:34:07,263
Now, this is my plan.

475
00:34:08,556 --> 00:34:09,807
Each of you...

476
00:34:10,391 --> 00:34:12,435
...will go back to your homes...

477
00:34:12,852 --> 00:34:15,772
...and resign from your jobs.

478
00:34:16,564 --> 00:34:17,774
Give notice.

479
00:34:18,232 --> 00:34:19,442
Retire.

480
00:34:21,152 --> 00:34:24,030
You will then buy,
with the money I give you...

481
00:34:25,031 --> 00:34:26,324
...sweet shops.

482
00:34:26,866 --> 00:34:28,117
Candy stores.

483
00:34:29,202 --> 00:34:33,414
The best and most respectable
sweet shops in England.

484
00:34:40,171 --> 00:34:43,841
Upstairs I have a trunkload
of this English money...

485
00:34:44,133 --> 00:34:46,386
...so you'll be able to offer three...

486
00:34:46,469 --> 00:34:49,472
...maybe four times
what these shops are worth.

487
00:34:49,555 --> 00:34:50,556
Go.

488
00:34:53,601 --> 00:34:55,353
On a certain day...

489
00:34:55,478 --> 00:34:57,939
...when all our plans are prepared...

490
00:34:58,064 --> 00:35:02,694
...you'll announce a great gala opening...

491
00:35:02,902 --> 00:35:07,240
...with free sweets, candies,
and chocolates for every child.

492
00:35:07,907 --> 00:35:09,409
Poison sweets.

493
00:35:09,617 --> 00:35:12,370
We'll wipe them out like weasels.

494
00:35:13,121 --> 00:35:15,039
- Who spoke?
- She did!

495
00:35:16,708 --> 00:35:18,042
It's brilliant.

496
00:35:18,751 --> 00:35:19,711
Poison?

497
00:35:20,878 --> 00:35:23,339
And you don't mind getting caught?

498
00:35:24,257 --> 00:35:26,050
Exposed?

499
00:35:26,384 --> 00:35:28,303
Vilified?

500
00:35:28,386 --> 00:35:29,679
I just thought...

501
00:35:29,762 --> 00:35:31,556
Spineless bumpkin!

502
00:35:32,223 --> 00:35:34,434
You blithering bogvumper!

503
00:35:35,018 --> 00:35:37,937
No wonder England is swarming with...

504
00:35:49,282 --> 00:35:52,327
Everything you sell that day...

505
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:55,455
...will have been treated...

506
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:57,832
...with my very latest...

507
00:35:58,625 --> 00:36:01,919
...and very greatest magic formula.

508
00:36:03,421 --> 00:36:06,966
Witches work only with magic!

509
00:36:08,176 --> 00:36:09,552
Wait. Come here.

510
00:36:10,511 --> 00:36:12,764
<i>Formula 86.</i>

511
00:36:13,473 --> 00:36:15,016
My greatest triumph.

512
00:36:16,643 --> 00:36:17,810
A work of...

513
00:36:19,145 --> 00:36:20,438
...genius.

514
00:36:21,981 --> 00:36:24,359
<i>Formula 86!</i>

515
00:36:25,276 --> 00:36:26,611
In this bottle...

516
00:36:27,111 --> 00:36:30,198
...500 doses...

517
00:36:30,281 --> 00:36:32,116
...with a delay mechanism...

518
00:36:32,158 --> 00:36:35,286
...that prevents it from working
until two hours...

519
00:36:35,536 --> 00:36:37,330
...after it has been taken.

520
00:36:40,333 --> 00:36:41,751
What does it do...

521
00:36:42,168 --> 00:36:43,795
...genius one?

522
00:36:52,387 --> 00:36:53,513
One dose...

523
00:36:54,222 --> 00:36:56,474
...and the time works to the second.

524
00:36:57,684 --> 00:37:00,061
But more than five doses...

525
00:37:00,353 --> 00:37:02,063
...breaks the delay barrier...

526
00:37:02,146 --> 00:37:04,983
...and the formula works instantly.

527
00:37:12,699 --> 00:37:13,866
The child...

528
00:37:16,327 --> 00:37:17,787
...starts to shrink.

529
00:37:22,542 --> 00:37:24,043
The child...

530
00:37:25,044 --> 00:37:26,796
...starts to...

531
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,340
...grow fur.

532
00:37:32,969 --> 00:37:34,053
Starts...

533
00:37:34,804 --> 00:37:36,889
...growing a tail.

534
00:37:39,684 --> 00:37:43,187
All this happens in precisely 25 seconds!

535
00:37:46,691 --> 00:37:49,360
Shrinking more.

536
00:37:54,032 --> 00:37:55,491
The child...

537
00:37:55,825 --> 00:37:58,745
...is no longer a child.

538
00:38:06,085 --> 00:38:07,587
The child...

539
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:11,924
...is a mouse!

540
00:38:16,763 --> 00:38:17,930
Silence.

541
00:38:18,765 --> 00:38:20,016
Shut up.

542
00:38:20,516 --> 00:38:22,935
Silence. Enough.

543
00:38:28,024 --> 00:38:29,400
This afternoon...

544
00:38:29,942 --> 00:38:32,445
...at precisely 4:15...

545
00:38:32,987 --> 00:38:35,365
...I put one dose of my formula...

546
00:38:35,615 --> 00:38:37,325
...on a bar of chocolate.

547
00:38:38,785 --> 00:38:41,412
I gave it to a repulsive...

548
00:38:41,454 --> 00:38:43,039
...smelly boy...

549
00:38:43,122 --> 00:38:44,791
...who was in the lobby.

550
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,837
"Was that good?" I asked him.

551
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:53,925
"Got any more?"...

552
00:38:55,134 --> 00:38:57,053
...said the nauseating child.

553
00:38:57,595 --> 00:39:01,349
"Six more bars like that one," I told him.

554
00:39:03,768 --> 00:39:05,520
In two minutes' time...

555
00:39:05,645 --> 00:39:08,106
...this appalling, foul-smelling creature...

556
00:39:08,147 --> 00:39:10,775
...is coming to collect his reward.

557
00:39:12,402 --> 00:39:14,362
In five minutes' time...

558
00:39:14,487 --> 00:39:17,448
...you'll see my magic formula in action.

559
00:39:20,368 --> 00:39:21,828
We're going to see.

560
00:39:26,332 --> 00:39:28,293
Quickly! Wigs! Gloves!

561
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:30,837
The appalling child will be here...

562
00:39:31,796 --> 00:39:33,715
...and you'll see my miracle.

563
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:36,050
Come on. Hurry up!

564
00:39:36,843 --> 00:39:38,177
That's good.

565
00:39:38,845 --> 00:39:40,305
Hurry up, everybody.

566
00:39:40,638 --> 00:39:41,597
Come on!

567
00:39:45,018 --> 00:39:47,603
Quickly! You're not on holiday!

568
00:39:47,687 --> 00:39:49,480
I'm being as quick as I can.

569
00:39:49,522 --> 00:39:50,606
Hurry up!

570
00:40:00,825 --> 00:40:01,743
Ready.

571
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:06,497
Hello, little boy.

572
00:40:06,956 --> 00:40:08,541
Come on in then.

573
00:40:09,334 --> 00:40:11,669
Come on. Wait just there.

574
00:40:17,216 --> 00:40:19,177
What's your name then?

575
00:40:19,969 --> 00:40:21,137
Bruno.

576
00:40:22,221 --> 00:40:23,431
Madam!

577
00:40:38,863 --> 00:40:42,158
That lady promised me six whole bars...

578
00:40:42,241 --> 00:40:45,662
...of cream-whip hazelnut milk chocolate.

579
00:40:48,915 --> 00:40:50,917
I've come to collect.

580
00:40:52,919 --> 00:40:54,087
Ladies...

581
00:40:55,088 --> 00:40:57,256
...may I introduce Bruno?

582
00:40:57,799 --> 00:40:59,217
Come up, Bruno.

583
00:40:59,676 --> 00:41:01,386
I have the chocolate here.

584
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:08,184
I said 6:15.

585
00:41:09,185 --> 00:41:12,105
And that is 15 seconds from now.

586
00:41:17,902 --> 00:41:19,988
You are in for a treat.

587
00:41:23,282 --> 00:41:24,867
We all are!

588
00:41:31,666 --> 00:41:33,626
What's going on?

589
00:41:34,252 --> 00:41:36,045
<i>Just a few moments.</i>

590
00:41:38,548 --> 00:41:39,507
Five...

591
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:41,301
I can't see any chocolates.

592
00:41:41,384 --> 00:41:46,347
...three, two, one, zero!

593
00:41:50,893 --> 00:41:54,063
We have ignition!

594
00:41:55,732 --> 00:41:58,359
Everybody, look! It's fantastic!

595
00:41:58,443 --> 00:41:59,569
It's begun!

596
00:42:01,237 --> 00:42:03,489
I can't stand it! It's so wonderful!

597
00:42:04,324 --> 00:42:05,950
It's fantastic!

598
00:42:36,022 --> 00:42:37,523
Where'd he go?

599
00:42:44,155 --> 00:42:45,114
Keys!

600
00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:48,660
Enough! Silence!

601
00:42:49,452 --> 00:42:52,956
Before the banquet tonight,
come to my room in groups of 10.

602
00:42:53,206 --> 00:42:54,832
Room number 208.

603
00:42:55,458 --> 00:42:58,252
I'll give you each a bottle
containing 500 doses.

604
00:42:58,628 --> 00:43:00,129
Also plenty of money.

605
00:43:00,546 --> 00:43:03,341
Do not forget your nose plugs
for the dinner.

606
00:43:03,591 --> 00:43:06,094
The dining room will be full
of filthy children.

607
00:43:06,177 --> 00:43:09,681
Without your nose plugs,
the stink will be unbearable.

608
00:43:10,556 --> 00:43:14,143
Now we'll have drinks on the terrace
with that ridiculous manager.

609
00:43:14,227 --> 00:43:15,728
Any questions?

610
00:43:17,522 --> 00:43:21,317
What if one of the chocolates
were accidentally eaten by a grownup?

611
00:43:22,735 --> 00:43:25,279
That's just too bad for the grownup.

612
00:43:25,363 --> 00:43:26,864
The meeting is over.

613
00:43:27,824 --> 00:43:29,200
Until next year.

614
00:43:34,247 --> 00:43:35,206
Wait!

615
00:43:43,006 --> 00:43:44,257
I smell...

616
00:43:46,092 --> 00:43:47,593
...dog's droppings.

617
00:43:51,931 --> 00:43:53,057
She's right.

618
00:43:55,184 --> 00:43:56,769
The smell!

619
00:44:09,365 --> 00:44:10,533
She's right!

620
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:16,205
Search out this small lump of dung!

621
00:44:18,625 --> 00:44:19,626
Find it!

622
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:23,504
It must be exterminated immediately!

623
00:44:31,137 --> 00:44:32,889
There he is!

624
00:44:52,825 --> 00:44:54,160
He's wiggling through.

625
00:44:54,243 --> 00:44:55,495
He's getting away.

626
00:44:55,578 --> 00:44:56,996
Come here, boy.

627
00:44:57,622 --> 00:44:58,957
Bring him to me!

628
00:45:17,058 --> 00:45:18,559
There he is!

629
00:45:47,922 --> 00:45:49,674
I saw him come this way.

630
00:45:49,882 --> 00:45:51,342
Where could he be?

631
00:46:06,733 --> 00:46:07,984
Bye-bye.

632
00:46:18,286 --> 00:46:20,079
No! My baby! Stop!

633
00:46:30,131 --> 00:46:32,133
A baby in a pram.

634
00:46:36,346 --> 00:46:37,347
Lovely!

635
00:46:49,651 --> 00:46:50,652
Oh, no.

636
00:46:51,444 --> 00:46:53,321
Get the boy! He's getting away!

637
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:39,117
Grandma, wake up!

638
00:47:39,826 --> 00:47:41,577
Please, Grandma!

639
00:47:43,413 --> 00:47:44,747
My grandma!

640
00:47:45,164 --> 00:47:48,126
An old adversary, I have discovered.

641
00:47:48,835 --> 00:47:50,461
Very old.

642
00:47:50,503 --> 00:47:52,422
If you hurt my grandma...

643
00:47:52,505 --> 00:47:53,548
Silence!

644
00:47:57,010 --> 00:47:58,678
We've got him, madam.

645
00:48:05,476 --> 00:48:07,145
Don't bite.

646
00:48:09,647 --> 00:48:11,065
Open up.

647
00:48:13,443 --> 00:48:14,986
Five hundred doses.

648
00:48:21,034 --> 00:48:22,160
Come along.

649
00:48:23,703 --> 00:48:24,704
Get up.

650
00:48:38,426 --> 00:48:39,636
Look.

651
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:51,189
This stinking little carbuncle
has had 500 doses.

652
00:48:52,065 --> 00:48:54,859
We are having instantaneous action.

653
00:49:08,748 --> 00:49:10,249
'Bye.

654
00:49:28,434 --> 00:49:29,602
Kill him.

655
00:49:30,728 --> 00:49:31,688
Kill him!

656
00:49:45,034 --> 00:49:47,120
Leave that little stinkpot!

657
00:49:47,453 --> 00:49:49,414
It's not worth bothering about.

658
00:49:49,455 --> 00:49:52,875
Come. Some whiskey and champagne
to celebrate.

659
00:49:54,294 --> 00:49:57,297
Bruno? I don't believe it, I can talk.

660
00:49:57,964 --> 00:49:58,965
Bruno?

661
00:50:01,634 --> 00:50:02,927
Who's that?

662
00:50:02,969 --> 00:50:05,221
Bruno, it's me. Luke.

663
00:50:06,931 --> 00:50:08,641
I'm down here.

664
00:50:09,309 --> 00:50:11,102
Where? I can't see you.

665
00:50:11,185 --> 00:50:12,812
Down here.

666
00:50:13,021 --> 00:50:14,397
You can talk, too.

667
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:15,773
This is weird.

668
00:50:19,819 --> 00:50:22,196
- This icing is terrific.
- Are you okay?

669
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:25,033
They didn't give me
the six bars of chocolate.

670
00:50:25,116 --> 00:50:27,952
You couldn't eat six bars of candy
now that you're a mouse.

671
00:50:28,161 --> 00:50:30,288
Don't be stupid. I'm not a...

672
00:50:30,997 --> 00:50:33,207
<i>Just because you're a...</i>

673
00:50:33,666 --> 00:50:35,668
That doesn't mean that I'm a...

674
00:50:37,128 --> 00:50:38,588
Good Lord.

675
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:44,677
I'm not too keen on being a mouse.

676
00:50:44,761 --> 00:50:46,429
We gotta find a way out of here.

677
00:50:46,512 --> 00:50:48,931
How long before we change back,
do you think?

678
00:50:49,015 --> 00:50:50,308
I don't think we will.

679
00:50:50,350 --> 00:50:51,893
Of course we will.

680
00:50:52,101 --> 00:50:56,022
We've gotta get upstairs and wake
my grandma. I'm real worried about her.

681
00:50:56,648 --> 00:50:59,942
Maybe it was the witch, or her diabetes.

682
00:51:00,193 --> 00:51:02,612
I only know she didn't wake up when I...

683
00:51:03,237 --> 00:51:05,073
She's got some peanuts, too.

684
00:51:05,865 --> 00:51:07,200
Dry-roasted?

685
00:51:08,368 --> 00:51:09,869
All right.

686
00:51:10,912 --> 00:51:12,080
Come on.

687
00:51:13,873 --> 00:51:15,375
William and Mary!

688
00:51:15,541 --> 00:51:17,335
Hi. It's me, Luke.

689
00:51:17,418 --> 00:51:19,003
Are you two all right?

690
00:51:19,379 --> 00:51:22,465
Crikey. Did they eat the chocolate as well?

691
00:51:22,715 --> 00:51:26,177
They were my pet mice.
But I guess they can't talk like we can.

692
00:51:26,386 --> 00:51:27,887
Catch you two later.

693
00:51:33,226 --> 00:51:34,519
Come on, Bruno.

694
00:51:35,728 --> 00:51:36,771
This way.

695
00:51:55,081 --> 00:51:56,207
They're gone.

696
00:51:56,249 --> 00:51:57,542
It's all clear.

697
00:51:57,875 --> 00:51:58,835
Come on.

698
00:52:00,086 --> 00:52:01,504
Wait for me.

699
00:52:04,257 --> 00:52:08,761
Running on a full stomach
isn't good for you.

700
00:52:08,845 --> 00:52:10,555
Better than being caught.

701
00:52:14,225 --> 00:52:17,687
- Keep up, Bruno.
- Sports give me indigestion.

702
00:52:22,942 --> 00:52:23,901
Get back.

703
00:52:23,985 --> 00:52:27,071
Okay, when I say "go", go!

704
00:52:27,947 --> 00:52:28,740
Go!

705
00:52:28,781 --> 00:52:30,241
- Run!
- Wait.

706
00:52:33,411 --> 00:52:34,579
Follow me.

707
00:52:41,794 --> 00:52:43,546
How will we get upstairs?

708
00:52:44,088 --> 00:52:45,006
I'm sorry.

709
00:52:45,089 --> 00:52:47,550
I don't know what I'm paying for.
I really don't.

710
00:52:47,634 --> 00:52:48,885
An overheated room.

711
00:52:48,968 --> 00:52:51,846
Dad? Hey, there's my dad!

712
00:52:51,971 --> 00:52:54,390
He doesn't know what's happened.
He'll kill you.

713
00:52:54,474 --> 00:52:55,767
My own father?

714
00:52:56,309 --> 00:52:59,812
The photographer of that brochure
should be arrested for fraud.

715
00:52:59,896 --> 00:53:02,440
I'm going to tell him. He'll put a stop to it.

716
00:53:02,649 --> 00:53:03,941
No, not now.

717
00:53:04,108 --> 00:53:07,362
Trust me, he'll stamp on you
the moment he sees you.

718
00:53:07,612 --> 00:53:08,571
Quick!

719
00:53:11,699 --> 00:53:14,035
It's so nice not having the kids around.

720
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:18,581
I smell food. Is there anything in this bag?

721
00:53:19,165 --> 00:53:20,500
They'll be fine.

722
00:53:20,583 --> 00:53:22,585
I think John was getting a cold.

723
00:53:22,669 --> 00:53:25,880
It's always the same.
You must relax once in a while.

724
00:53:25,964 --> 00:53:27,298
All right.

725
00:53:29,008 --> 00:53:30,301
This is it. Let's go.

726
00:53:30,385 --> 00:53:32,136
- No more sports!
- Hurry!

727
00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:35,974
Faster! Faster!

728
00:53:39,018 --> 00:53:40,812
I forgot my tail.

729
00:53:42,689 --> 00:53:44,440
Keep to the side!

730
00:53:48,569 --> 00:53:50,905
Being like this might not be so bad.

731
00:53:51,364 --> 00:53:53,366
There won't be any more school.

732
00:53:53,616 --> 00:53:55,034
That would be all right.

733
00:53:55,118 --> 00:53:57,662
Look at that. Don't eat the cheese.

734
00:53:57,745 --> 00:54:01,749
Remember, we've got two enemies now:
Humans and cats.

735
00:54:01,874 --> 00:54:04,002
We've got three cats at home.

736
00:54:04,210 --> 00:54:05,211
They'll have to go.

737
00:54:05,253 --> 00:54:08,298
My mother loves them,
but she's terrified of mice.

738
00:54:09,882 --> 00:54:10,842
Grandma!

739
00:54:12,010 --> 00:54:12,969
Grandma!

740
00:54:16,597 --> 00:54:18,641
Take your afternoon off tomorrow.

741
00:54:22,145 --> 00:54:23,104
Let's go.

742
00:54:23,187 --> 00:54:24,731
What? Hey, wait!

743
00:54:25,231 --> 00:54:28,151
There are four more floors to be done.

744
00:54:28,234 --> 00:54:29,319
Yes, sir.

745
00:54:30,570 --> 00:54:31,988
You do over there.

746
00:54:33,114 --> 00:54:34,741
I'll get this one.

747
00:54:35,325 --> 00:54:36,284
Back.

748
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:40,705
It bit me!

749
00:54:40,913 --> 00:54:43,207
- What bit you?
- A mouse in the towel.

750
00:54:44,042 --> 00:54:45,376
A mouse?

751
00:54:54,927 --> 00:54:56,054
Is she sober?

752
00:54:56,137 --> 00:54:59,223
Of course she's sober.
I've been with her all after...

753
00:54:59,515 --> 00:55:00,933
I mean, I...

754
00:55:01,559 --> 00:55:02,894
...I saw her...

755
00:55:02,935 --> 00:55:04,896
Yes, she's sober. Don't be stupid.

756
00:55:04,937 --> 00:55:06,564
Go to the second floor.

757
00:55:06,773 --> 00:55:08,941
Grandma! Grandma!

758
00:55:10,068 --> 00:55:11,569
Here by the phone.

759
00:55:13,446 --> 00:55:14,864
It's me Luke.

760
00:55:16,783 --> 00:55:18,159
Are you all right?

761
00:55:20,912 --> 00:55:21,871
Luke?

762
00:55:22,330 --> 00:55:23,790
It's me, Grandma.

763
00:55:26,376 --> 00:55:27,251
Luke!

764
00:55:27,335 --> 00:55:29,921
It was the Grand High Witch.
She is in this hotel.

765
00:55:29,963 --> 00:55:31,673
My God!

766
00:55:32,215 --> 00:55:34,509
Don't cry. It's okay.

767
00:55:34,759 --> 00:55:36,552
Things could have been worse.

768
00:55:36,636 --> 00:55:37,971
I got away from them.

769
00:55:38,054 --> 00:55:39,514
I'm still alive.

770
00:55:39,806 --> 00:55:41,808
My darling Luke.

771
00:55:42,058 --> 00:55:43,643
What have they done to you?

772
00:55:43,726 --> 00:55:45,687
They turned me into a mouse.

773
00:55:47,105 --> 00:55:50,066
I'm sorry. I can't stop shaking.

774
00:55:50,942 --> 00:55:53,403
The Grand High Witch, here?

775
00:55:53,569 --> 00:55:56,364
There's hundreds of them
right here in this hotel.

776
00:55:56,739 --> 00:55:59,575
I knew it. I could see it in her eyes.

777
00:55:59,909 --> 00:56:01,327
Lord.

778
00:56:02,412 --> 00:56:04,205
You squashed me.

779
00:56:05,498 --> 00:56:07,625
Grandma. This is Bruno Jenkins.

780
00:56:07,875 --> 00:56:08,710
I'm sorry.

781
00:56:08,793 --> 00:56:11,629
He said you've got dry-roast peanuts.

782
00:56:12,505 --> 00:56:13,631
Yes.

783
00:56:14,674 --> 00:56:15,925
Good. Thanks.

784
00:56:18,886 --> 00:56:20,430
We've got to stop them.

785
00:56:20,513 --> 00:56:24,183
They leave tomorrow with a bundle
of money and gallons of a formula...

786
00:56:24,267 --> 00:56:27,312
...that will change every kid in England
into a mouse.

787
00:56:27,395 --> 00:56:28,980
We must stop them.

788
00:56:30,773 --> 00:56:32,317
- Miss Ernst.
- Lois.

789
00:56:34,193 --> 00:56:36,529
Nice to see a bit of international clientele.

790
00:56:36,863 --> 00:56:38,990
- How do you do?
- Just flew in, did you?

791
00:56:39,032 --> 00:56:40,033
What?

792
00:56:40,074 --> 00:56:43,036
<i>Jet lag's the curse of the business classes.</i>

793
00:56:43,161 --> 00:56:44,829
Hope you don't mind me joining you.

794
00:56:44,871 --> 00:56:46,623
You're most welcome, sir.

795
00:56:47,957 --> 00:56:49,334
Herbert Jenkins.

796
00:56:49,542 --> 00:56:51,836
I'd like to say hello
to a fellow philanthropist.

797
00:56:52,337 --> 00:56:54,005
You collect stamps?

798
00:56:54,047 --> 00:56:55,340
Charities.

799
00:56:55,548 --> 00:56:58,051
This R.S.P.C.C.

800
00:56:58,134 --> 00:56:59,427
What is this R.S. P...

801
00:56:59,510 --> 00:57:00,970
Cruelty to children.

802
00:57:01,638 --> 00:57:04,641
Of course, you give money for the little...

803
00:57:07,435 --> 00:57:09,020
...children and...

804
00:57:09,896 --> 00:57:11,356
...we, of course...

805
00:57:11,606 --> 00:57:13,983
...we also give money for the little...

806
00:57:16,152 --> 00:57:18,279
I see you're holding your annual meeting.

807
00:57:18,363 --> 00:57:19,530
Funnily enough...

808
00:57:19,572 --> 00:57:22,825
...I addressed the last annual meeting
of our Rotary Club.

809
00:57:23,242 --> 00:57:26,079
Do you know much
about this country's Rotary Club?

810
00:57:31,042 --> 00:57:33,628
If I could get the formula into their food...

811
00:57:34,754 --> 00:57:37,840
You just have to get me down
to the Grand High Witch's room.

812
00:57:38,591 --> 00:57:39,676
I'm ready.

813
00:57:40,551 --> 00:57:41,886
I don't know.

814
00:57:41,970 --> 00:57:44,097
I've got to find the formula.

815
00:57:44,597 --> 00:57:45,431
No.

816
00:57:46,015 --> 00:57:47,684
This is too dangerous.

817
00:57:47,767 --> 00:57:48,893
Grandma.

818
00:57:51,854 --> 00:57:53,648
It's not far down.

819
00:57:53,940 --> 00:57:57,277
You're asking me to lower you
into the jaws of death.

820
00:57:57,360 --> 00:58:00,029
You two can't take on
the Grand High Witch.

821
00:58:00,238 --> 00:58:02,657
We can. We've got to.

822
00:58:02,782 --> 00:58:04,617
No one else will believe us.

823
00:58:04,701 --> 00:58:06,744
Quick, before she comes back.

824
00:58:15,670 --> 00:58:17,297
Luke, be careful.

825
00:58:18,298 --> 00:58:19,632
Please be careful.

826
00:58:19,716 --> 00:58:21,050
I'll be careful.

827
00:58:21,134 --> 00:58:22,260
Don't worry.

828
00:58:22,635 --> 00:58:23,970
Not so fast.

829
00:58:33,604 --> 00:58:34,772
Be careful.

830
00:58:35,273 --> 00:58:36,858
I will.

831
00:58:47,285 --> 00:58:48,369
Oh, no!

832
00:58:50,747 --> 00:58:51,748
Grandma!

833
00:58:53,499 --> 00:58:55,793
Luke, what happened? Are you all right?

834
00:58:57,253 --> 00:58:58,755
Why don't you answer?

835
00:59:02,342 --> 00:59:03,426
Down, cat.

836
00:59:03,885 --> 00:59:04,886
No, cat.

837
00:59:07,472 --> 00:59:09,265
Grandma, help!

838
00:59:13,811 --> 00:59:14,896
Down, cat!

839
00:59:15,021 --> 00:59:16,981
No. Go, cat.

840
00:59:18,691 --> 00:59:20,109
Grandma!

841
00:59:20,485 --> 00:59:21,819
Get away. Help!

842
00:59:22,278 --> 00:59:25,073
Get him away, Grandma! Help, Grandma!

843
00:59:26,824 --> 00:59:28,034
Grandma, help!

844
00:59:29,994 --> 00:59:30,662
Puss!

845
00:59:30,703 --> 00:59:33,373
Grandma, come on! Do something!

846
00:59:33,706 --> 00:59:35,166
Get it, cat.

847
00:59:35,291 --> 00:59:37,502
Cat, puss.

848
00:59:37,794 --> 00:59:39,504
Come on. Take it.

849
00:59:43,174 --> 00:59:44,634
Keep him there, Grandma.

850
00:59:44,717 --> 00:59:45,927
Come on, you little kitten.

851
00:59:46,594 --> 00:59:47,887
Come on, pussy.

852
00:59:48,096 --> 00:59:49,347
Keep him busy.

853
00:59:50,807 --> 00:59:52,517
Here. Take it.

854
00:59:57,939 --> 00:59:58,940
Come on.

855
00:59:59,107 --> 01:00:01,192
Take it, you silly cat.

856
01:00:01,734 --> 01:00:03,278
Don't let him in.

857
01:00:03,695 --> 01:00:04,737
Puss.

858
01:00:05,571 --> 01:00:06,698
Here.

859
01:00:22,797 --> 01:00:24,090
Hang on, tail.

860
01:00:30,930 --> 01:00:33,057
Come on, formula. Where are you?

861
01:00:58,875 --> 01:01:01,878
It has been unforgettable, Mr. Jenkins.

862
01:01:01,961 --> 01:01:03,421
My pleasure, madam.

863
01:01:03,630 --> 01:01:05,798
What a stimulating conversation
it has been.

864
01:01:05,882 --> 01:01:08,551
It's not every day that one meets a lady
of such quality...

865
01:01:08,885 --> 01:01:10,303
...and compassion.

866
01:01:25,860 --> 01:01:27,487
It's got to be somewhere up here.

867
01:01:27,820 --> 01:01:29,322
It's just got to be.

868
01:01:37,830 --> 01:01:38,790
Oh, man.

869
01:01:45,254 --> 01:01:46,923
We've got it, Grandma.

870
01:01:50,134 --> 01:01:52,804
Did you realize that was Bruno's father?

871
01:01:53,429 --> 01:01:54,555
Dreadful man.

872
01:01:54,639 --> 01:01:56,307
It was an act of mercy.

873
01:01:56,391 --> 01:01:58,851
The child shall never grow up
to be like his father.

874
01:02:01,437 --> 01:02:03,064
- Thanks.
- Liebchen?

875
01:02:07,735 --> 01:02:09,028
Liebchen?

876
01:02:17,495 --> 01:02:18,746
What is this?

877
01:02:20,456 --> 01:02:21,874
I'm so sorry.

878
01:02:21,958 --> 01:02:23,793
- I dropped my knitting.
- You!

879
01:02:25,878 --> 01:02:28,339
I'm knitting for my grandson.

880
01:02:28,423 --> 01:02:30,049
Have you seen him?

881
01:02:30,133 --> 01:02:31,134
No, no.

882
01:02:31,676 --> 01:02:32,719
Come, Liebchen.

883
01:02:32,802 --> 01:02:36,014
I'm dreadfully sorry. I do apologize.

884
01:02:36,180 --> 01:02:37,807
That's quite all right.

885
01:02:38,057 --> 01:02:40,435
If I see your grandson, I will...

886
01:02:42,478 --> 01:02:44,272
I will turn him into a mouse.

887
01:02:44,355 --> 01:02:47,525
And you, meddling old woman,
I'll deal with later.

888
01:02:54,991 --> 01:02:57,285
- Room 208.
- I hope we're not the first.

889
01:02:58,328 --> 01:02:59,746
Miss Ernst.

890
01:03:01,164 --> 01:03:02,248
Who is it?

891
01:03:02,332 --> 01:03:05,043
You told them to come up after the drinks.

892
01:03:05,627 --> 01:03:07,253
All right, let them in.

893
01:03:14,218 --> 01:03:15,303
Come in.

894
01:03:15,762 --> 01:03:17,847
You were wonderful this afternoon.

895
01:03:22,602 --> 01:03:24,187
You bad cat, Liebchen.

896
01:03:40,078 --> 01:03:42,747
So, when do you think
they'd implement it?

897
01:03:42,830 --> 01:03:44,749
First of the year, I suppose.

898
01:03:45,375 --> 01:03:47,418
This is a very pleasant hotel.

899
01:03:48,336 --> 01:03:51,172
The question is:
Would you like to work with them?

900
01:04:11,943 --> 01:04:13,945
I've got the formula!

901
01:04:14,279 --> 01:04:15,363
Thank God.

902
01:04:16,614 --> 01:04:18,491
Darling, I was so worried.

903
01:04:18,574 --> 01:04:21,286
There's 500 doses in this one little bottle.

904
01:04:21,744 --> 01:04:24,664
It's enough to change all the witches
in this hotel.

905
01:04:25,665 --> 01:04:26,958
Where's Bruno?

906
01:04:27,667 --> 01:04:29,836
There's some jolly good grapes here.

907
01:04:30,503 --> 01:04:31,713
What's happening?

908
01:04:31,796 --> 01:04:33,631
Nothing until dinnertime.

909
01:04:34,257 --> 01:04:36,592
We've got to get you back to your parents.

910
01:04:36,676 --> 01:04:38,344
What time is it?

911
01:04:38,928 --> 01:04:39,804
7:00.

912
01:04:39,846 --> 01:04:41,472
They'll be in the bar.

913
01:04:41,556 --> 01:04:44,017
A sherry and a large malt whiskey
and soda...

914
01:04:44,100 --> 01:04:45,476
...at 7:00 sharp.

915
01:04:46,019 --> 01:04:47,562
It gives you an appetite.

916
01:04:47,645 --> 01:04:48,604
Does it?

917
01:04:49,188 --> 01:04:50,273
Come on.

918
01:04:50,523 --> 01:04:53,901
Into my handbag, both of you.

919
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:56,738
This is going to be difficult.

920
01:04:57,405 --> 01:04:58,364
I'm full.

921
01:04:58,406 --> 01:05:00,867
We've got to get to the kitchen quickly.

922
01:05:01,701 --> 01:05:02,910
That tickles.

923
01:05:05,747 --> 01:05:07,332
Is that them?

924
01:05:07,373 --> 01:05:09,000
Yes. Listen, Grandma.

925
01:05:09,417 --> 01:05:10,877
Maybe we ought to...

926
01:05:11,377 --> 01:05:12,837
No, wait! Listen.

927
01:05:16,382 --> 01:05:17,675
Don't drown it.

928
01:05:18,384 --> 01:05:20,386
- Sorry.
- Look what you've done!

929
01:05:20,428 --> 01:05:21,929
She was drowning it.

930
01:05:22,221 --> 01:05:24,974
Are you Mr. And Mrs. Jenkins?

931
01:05:25,391 --> 01:05:27,894
Hole in one. What can we do for you?

932
01:05:28,144 --> 01:05:31,689
I'd like to have a word with you
about your son.

933
01:05:32,315 --> 01:05:33,650
Sit down.

934
01:05:35,443 --> 01:05:37,820
What's the little tyke been up to now?

935
01:05:38,112 --> 01:05:40,114
Raiding the kitchen, I suppose.

936
01:05:41,532 --> 01:05:44,869
If we could go somewhere more private.

937
01:05:45,370 --> 01:05:46,329
Private?

938
01:05:47,246 --> 01:05:49,040
Well, it is rather a...

939
01:05:49,499 --> 01:05:51,000
...personal matter.

940
01:05:51,209 --> 01:05:53,461
Look, Mrs. Whatever your name is...

941
01:05:53,670 --> 01:05:56,881
...if Bruno has broken a window
or smashed your spectacles...

942
01:05:56,923 --> 01:05:59,676
...I'll pay for it, but we're not budging.

943
01:05:59,759 --> 01:06:01,135
We always sit at this table.

944
01:06:01,260 --> 01:06:04,973
Where is Bruno anyway?
Tell him to come and see me.

945
01:06:05,807 --> 01:06:08,351
He is here already.

946
01:06:08,685 --> 01:06:09,936
What?

947
01:06:10,019 --> 01:06:11,396
In my handbag.

948
01:06:12,438 --> 01:06:15,566
Your son has suffered a mishap.

949
01:06:15,775 --> 01:06:18,987
He has been drastically altered.

950
01:06:19,570 --> 01:06:20,780
Altered?

951
01:06:21,155 --> 01:06:22,907
What do you mean, "altered"?

952
01:06:22,991 --> 01:06:25,868
I'm trying to tell you as gently as possible.

953
01:06:26,577 --> 01:06:29,956
My grandson saw them doing it to him.

954
01:06:29,998 --> 01:06:31,582
Saw who doing what?

955
01:06:32,959 --> 01:06:37,797
Saw the witches turn him into a mouse.

956
01:06:40,758 --> 01:06:42,135
Are you crackers?

957
01:06:44,804 --> 01:06:48,182
Tell the manager to throw this nutcase
out of the hotel.

958
01:06:48,266 --> 01:06:50,184
You need a funny farm, you do.

959
01:06:51,269 --> 01:06:52,979
Tell them, Bruno.

960
01:06:55,273 --> 01:06:56,482
It's a mouse!

961
01:06:56,816 --> 01:07:00,028
I can't stand them! Get it away from here!

962
01:07:00,153 --> 01:07:03,156
It is Bruno. Tell them, Bruno.

963
01:07:03,239 --> 01:07:05,116
Get out of here! How dare you!

964
01:07:05,158 --> 01:07:07,452
- Tell them, Bruno.
- Get out of here.

965
01:07:09,078 --> 01:07:10,496
It's me, Mum.

966
01:07:10,538 --> 01:07:14,125
Out, before I call the police,
you barmy old loony.

967
01:07:14,334 --> 01:07:16,628
I don't think they recognize me.

968
01:07:16,836 --> 01:07:17,837
Push off!

969
01:07:17,879 --> 01:07:20,590
Never come back, you stupid old witch!

970
01:07:20,673 --> 01:07:22,425
I did my best, Bruno.

971
01:07:22,508 --> 01:07:24,427
Don't worry, dear. She's gone.

972
01:07:26,971 --> 01:07:29,766
Evening, madam,
I'm just popping in to turn down your bed.

973
01:07:30,683 --> 01:07:32,226
How is the room service here?

974
01:07:32,310 --> 01:07:33,895
- Diabolical.
- Good.

975
01:07:34,270 --> 01:07:36,272
How do you know that woman upstairs?

976
01:07:36,356 --> 01:07:38,900
Come along. Walk downstairs.
The lift is out of order.

977
01:07:38,983 --> 01:07:40,276
I suppose it must be.

978
01:07:41,027 --> 01:07:44,280
- It's a five-course meal.
- Good, I'm rather hungry.

979
01:09:01,065 --> 01:09:03,526
I'd like to go home, that's what I'd like.

980
01:09:04,068 --> 01:09:06,237
- What are you doing here?
- The banquet.

981
01:09:06,321 --> 01:09:08,448
No! Go to your room and prepare for...

982
01:09:09,824 --> 01:09:12,952
...tomorrow's flight.
Yes, have a good flight.

983
01:09:13,119 --> 01:09:14,621
But it's our banquet!

984
01:09:14,704 --> 01:09:17,123
You are not here to enjoy yourself.

985
01:09:17,206 --> 01:09:18,916
You are here as my staff.

986
01:09:18,958 --> 01:09:21,294
Go to your room! Now!

987
01:09:22,128 --> 01:09:23,755
Ladies.

988
01:09:26,424 --> 01:09:27,842
I quit!

989
01:09:41,314 --> 01:09:44,484
I can't go through with it.
We could go home, yes?

990
01:09:44,567 --> 01:09:46,819
Grandma, if we don't try...

991
01:09:47,028 --> 01:09:51,157
...every mother and father
in England will lose their kids.

992
01:09:51,658 --> 01:09:53,409
- I know.
- We must do it.

993
01:09:53,493 --> 01:09:57,163
8:03. Now, 8:15 exactly.

994
01:09:57,330 --> 01:09:59,958
- I'll remember.
- I'm so terrified.

995
01:10:00,333 --> 01:10:01,876
Grandma, now!

996
01:10:04,504 --> 01:10:06,130
No, madam. Please, no.

997
01:10:06,214 --> 01:10:08,174
I'm sorry. This isn't the dining room.

998
01:10:08,257 --> 01:10:10,218
I am sorry, truly.

999
01:10:10,426 --> 01:10:13,304
The guests are not permitted, madam.

1000
01:10:13,388 --> 01:10:15,556
I am sorry, but...

1001
01:10:52,468 --> 01:10:53,594
One moment.

1002
01:11:05,064 --> 01:11:08,067
How is the cress soup
for the children's charity group?

1003
01:11:10,528 --> 01:11:11,821
A soup!

1004
01:11:12,697 --> 01:11:14,324
Very good, but no more salt.

1005
01:11:14,407 --> 01:11:15,533
No more?

1006
01:11:19,829 --> 01:11:21,873
What are you doing?

1007
01:11:22,332 --> 01:11:24,709
Are you a murderer or a chef?

1008
01:11:42,435 --> 01:11:43,895
They're everywhere.

1009
01:11:49,734 --> 01:11:51,778
Table 5 says the veal's too tough.

1010
01:11:51,861 --> 01:11:54,030
I will take care of this personally.

1011
01:11:59,243 --> 01:12:00,703
Chef!

1012
01:12:01,663 --> 01:12:04,624
The R.S.P.C.C. Party all want soup.

1013
01:12:04,958 --> 01:12:06,626
That's 87 for watercress.

1014
01:12:06,709 --> 01:12:09,253
Debby, bring the soup tureens.

1015
01:12:09,337 --> 01:12:12,340
<i>He'll adore it now.
A magic touch, n'est-ce pas?</i>

1016
01:12:39,701 --> 01:12:41,995
I'll check the soup before it's served.

1017
01:12:52,505 --> 01:12:54,716
She's eating the soup.

1018
01:13:02,056 --> 01:13:03,558
I'll see you later.

1019
01:13:04,350 --> 01:13:06,144
We're short-staffed tonight.

1020
01:13:11,149 --> 01:13:12,984
I may be a little late.

1021
01:13:13,484 --> 01:13:14,819
I can wait.

1022
01:13:26,539 --> 01:13:27,874
What is it?

1023
01:13:39,594 --> 01:13:40,678
Now.

1024
01:13:46,309 --> 01:13:47,685
A mouse!

1025
01:13:53,691 --> 01:13:57,528
There's a mouse running around
in my bloody underpants!

1026
01:13:57,570 --> 01:14:00,198
For goodness sake. Out of the way.

1027
01:14:02,033 --> 01:14:03,952
Get it out! Somebody help me!

1028
01:14:04,035 --> 01:14:05,870
Take your trousers off, you idiot!

1029
01:14:05,912 --> 01:14:07,413
Take your pants off.

1030
01:14:08,206 --> 01:14:09,290
Give me that.

1031
01:14:09,374 --> 01:14:11,834
Somebody get it out before it bites me!

1032
01:14:14,754 --> 01:14:15,880
I got to get out of here.

1033
01:14:15,922 --> 01:14:17,423
Somebody get it out!

1034
01:14:19,717 --> 01:14:20,885
I saw it.

1035
01:14:21,094 --> 01:14:22,220
Do you see it?

1036
01:14:22,303 --> 01:14:23,429
Nothing.

1037
01:14:24,847 --> 01:14:26,432
There's nothing much in there.

1038
01:14:28,685 --> 01:14:31,145
A lot of fuss about nothing. Mice.

1039
01:14:34,691 --> 01:14:36,109
It's gone.

1040
01:14:54,294 --> 01:14:55,295
Yes?

1041
01:14:55,628 --> 01:14:57,046
What kind of soup is that?

1042
01:14:57,130 --> 01:14:59,215
That is the cress soup.

1043
01:14:59,424 --> 01:15:02,927
If they're all having cress soup,
I'll have the cress soup.

1044
01:15:03,011 --> 01:15:05,972
That soup is specially made for their party.

1045
01:15:06,139 --> 01:15:09,017
The soup on the menu tonight
is cock-a-leekie...

1046
01:15:09,267 --> 01:15:11,185
...and very nice it is, too.

1047
01:15:11,436 --> 01:15:13,104
But I don't want cock-a-leekie.

1048
01:15:13,187 --> 01:15:15,648
I don't like cock-a-leekie. I like cress.

1049
01:15:15,690 --> 01:15:17,650
So take that back to the kitchen...

1050
01:15:17,734 --> 01:15:20,653
...and tell the chef there's one more order
for cress soup.

1051
01:15:20,695 --> 01:15:22,071
There's a laddie.

1052
01:15:38,463 --> 01:15:39,922
What's that then?

1053
01:15:55,396 --> 01:15:57,565
Don't touch it! It's in the soup!

1054
01:15:57,690 --> 01:15:58,983
Don't touch the soup!

1055
01:15:59,067 --> 01:16:00,318
Child!

1056
01:16:02,028 --> 01:16:03,321
Good.

1057
01:16:04,238 --> 01:16:05,531
Hurry up.

1058
01:16:11,371 --> 01:16:12,914
Nearly 8:15.

1059
01:16:16,876 --> 01:16:18,753
No. I can't believe it.

1060
01:16:19,003 --> 01:16:19,963
Dear me!

1061
01:16:20,046 --> 01:16:21,798
No, madam, please.

1062
01:16:22,173 --> 01:16:23,508
<i>Just a moment.</i>

1063
01:16:34,352 --> 01:16:36,020
8:15. I made it!

1064
01:16:39,732 --> 01:16:40,900
One more...

1065
01:16:42,193 --> 01:16:44,487
...cress soup, table 9.

1066
01:17:19,314 --> 01:17:20,398
Hi, Bruno.

1067
01:17:22,442 --> 01:17:24,235
Lovely, isn't it?

1068
01:17:24,444 --> 01:17:25,528
Red.

1069
01:17:25,612 --> 01:17:26,613
Yes.

1070
01:17:27,030 --> 01:17:28,031
Red.

1071
01:17:33,286 --> 01:17:35,788
I didn't want to be one of them anyway.

1072
01:17:39,834 --> 01:17:41,836
I'll bring you your main course.

1073
01:17:42,837 --> 01:17:45,131
- Well?
- I put it in the soup.

1074
01:17:45,214 --> 01:17:47,550
- The whole bottle?
- Every drop.

1075
01:17:47,634 --> 01:17:49,093
You angel.

1076
01:17:50,386 --> 01:17:51,763
You're bleeding.

1077
01:17:51,804 --> 01:17:55,266
A cook tried to cut off my tail
with a carving knife.

1078
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:58,269
Look! The Grand High Witch
is eating the soup!

1079
01:18:02,023 --> 01:18:03,816
They all are.

1080
01:18:12,700 --> 01:18:14,035
Another roll, sir?

1081
01:18:14,118 --> 01:18:15,328
No, thanks.

1082
01:18:16,120 --> 01:18:17,497
I'd like some...

1083
01:18:20,792 --> 01:18:22,919
I'd like some black pepper, please.

1084
01:18:23,378 --> 01:18:24,963
- My God!
- What?

1085
01:18:25,505 --> 01:18:28,841
Bruno's father
is about to eat the soup, too.

1086
01:18:29,217 --> 01:18:30,385
- Stop him!
- Quick!

1087
01:18:30,468 --> 01:18:33,846
I agree, dear, it's been a nightmare.

1088
01:18:34,639 --> 01:18:36,432
At least we got some cress soup.

1089
01:18:37,392 --> 01:18:38,768
Don't touch it!

1090
01:18:39,310 --> 01:18:42,480
I told you she was a loony.
She's an absolute nutter!

1091
01:18:43,022 --> 01:18:44,941
Look at my bloody soup!

1092
01:18:45,191 --> 01:18:47,443
And all that stuff about Bruno!

1093
01:18:47,527 --> 01:18:50,363
Bruno has been turned into...

1094
01:18:50,446 --> 01:18:52,949
He has not been turned into a...

1095
01:18:53,032 --> 01:18:55,076
Yes, I have. Hello, Dad.

1096
01:19:02,709 --> 01:19:05,837
Don't worry, Dad. It isn't all bad...

1097
01:19:06,713 --> 01:19:08,881
...just so long as the cat doesn't get me.

1098
01:19:08,965 --> 01:19:10,133
Bruno.

1099
01:19:10,216 --> 01:19:12,844
No more school, no more homework.

1100
01:19:13,094 --> 01:19:15,179
I'll live in the kitchen cupboard.

1101
01:19:17,307 --> 01:19:18,808
This is a trick.

1102
01:19:19,225 --> 01:19:20,602
It's that whiskey.

1103
01:19:21,519 --> 01:19:22,437
Hello, Mum.

1104
01:19:24,564 --> 01:19:27,483
Would you like to know
who did this to Bruno?

1105
01:19:35,867 --> 01:19:37,076
It's working.

1106
01:19:46,461 --> 01:19:47,670
Let go of me!

1107
01:19:51,924 --> 01:19:55,136
<i>My Formula 86! Give me that spoon!</i>

1108
01:19:56,638 --> 01:19:58,640
That woman over there.

1109
01:20:01,267 --> 01:20:04,896
She is the Grand High Witch.

1110
01:20:08,107 --> 01:20:11,027
Grandma,
she needs more time to become a...

1111
01:20:13,446 --> 01:20:15,990
She did it to Bruno...

1112
01:20:17,325 --> 01:20:22,288
...and thousands of other children
before him.

1113
01:20:24,582 --> 01:20:25,875
Good evening.

1114
01:20:26,084 --> 01:20:28,544
You're doomed, old woman!

1115
01:20:29,337 --> 01:20:31,255
You're doomed forever!

1116
01:20:31,297 --> 01:20:32,632
It must work.

1117
01:20:32,757 --> 01:20:33,758
You.

1118
01:20:42,308 --> 01:20:43,810
This is it, Bruno.

1119
01:20:54,487 --> 01:20:55,571
Come on!

1120
01:20:55,822 --> 01:20:57,282
Get the mice!

1121
01:21:04,831 --> 01:21:06,291
One is a witch.

1122
01:21:07,333 --> 01:21:11,045
The most evil and appalling woman
in the world.

1123
01:21:11,504 --> 01:21:13,256
A loathsome...

1124
01:21:13,756 --> 01:21:16,175
...hideous disgrace!

1125
01:21:16,509 --> 01:21:17,969
Yeah, Grandma!

1126
01:21:18,136 --> 01:21:22,807
I'm not finished with you yet, old woman!

1127
01:21:23,057 --> 01:21:24,642
Next time!

1128
01:21:25,893 --> 01:21:27,562
No next time.

1129
01:21:27,687 --> 01:21:31,316
This time it's your turn.

1130
01:21:43,536 --> 01:21:45,163
Herbert, do something!

1131
01:21:45,204 --> 01:21:46,956
It's in your garment.

1132
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:48,708
- Good night.
- Good night.

1133
01:21:51,961 --> 01:21:54,714
Get that brown one! No, the other one!

1134
01:21:56,883 --> 01:21:58,217
Look, it's her.

1135
01:21:59,719 --> 01:22:01,512
Get away from me!

1136
01:22:01,596 --> 01:22:03,389
Don't let her get away.

1137
01:22:03,973 --> 01:22:04,974
Get away!

1138
01:22:10,188 --> 01:22:11,856
Get me out of here!

1139
01:22:15,401 --> 01:22:17,654
Get out of my hotel!

1140
01:22:20,073 --> 01:22:21,240
Mr. Stringer.

1141
01:22:23,201 --> 01:22:26,913
There's an especially impetuous one
over there, under the water jug.

1142
01:22:26,996 --> 01:22:27,914
Thank you.

1143
01:22:27,997 --> 01:22:29,916
It's a pleasure.

1144
01:22:30,792 --> 01:22:31,876
Get away from me!

1145
01:22:31,960 --> 01:22:34,295
I tell you, get away from me!

1146
01:22:36,172 --> 01:22:37,799
Get away from me!

1147
01:22:50,770 --> 01:22:53,439
My mum's not very crazy about mice.

1148
01:22:53,773 --> 01:22:55,358
So I see.

1149
01:22:57,277 --> 01:22:58,695
Here is Bruno.

1150
01:22:59,737 --> 01:23:02,198
- Thank you.
- He needs to go on a diet.

1151
01:23:03,241 --> 01:23:05,660
Hi, Dad. Hi, Mum.

1152
01:23:05,743 --> 01:23:07,745
Stop it, dear. Stop it.

1153
01:23:08,121 --> 01:23:09,914
This is our Bruno.

1154
01:23:11,249 --> 01:23:13,960
Don't cry, Mum. You'll get used to me.

1155
01:23:16,629 --> 01:23:18,256
<i>Just a minute, Grandma.</i>

1156
01:23:18,339 --> 01:23:19,549
'Bye, Bruno.

1157
01:23:19,924 --> 01:23:20,967
'Bye.

1158
01:23:21,634 --> 01:23:23,386
Excuse me.

1159
01:23:25,638 --> 01:23:27,932
You always wanted me to lose weight.

1160
01:23:28,016 --> 01:23:30,101
Well, look at me now.

1161
01:23:38,651 --> 01:23:41,779
There. But I still don't understand.

1162
01:23:41,821 --> 01:23:43,197
I won't be long.

1163
01:23:49,787 --> 01:23:51,164
Come on, this way.

1164
01:23:51,247 --> 01:23:53,166
Right to the main dining room.

1165
01:23:53,583 --> 01:23:54,584
Hurry up.

1166
01:23:54,667 --> 01:23:56,461
- Your taxi, madam.
- Good-bye.

1167
01:24:23,529 --> 01:24:24,948
Put it down, Bill.

1168
01:24:25,490 --> 01:24:27,200
- That's it.
- You all right?

1169
01:24:30,036 --> 01:24:31,829
- Can you manage?
- I'm fine.

1170
01:24:31,871 --> 01:24:33,623
Look out. There's a step.

1171
01:24:37,001 --> 01:24:38,419
- Mrs. Evershim?
- Yes.

1172
01:24:38,503 --> 01:24:40,630
- There's a trunk for you.
- A trunk?

1173
01:24:41,547 --> 01:24:44,008
- Will you sign for it?
- Yes, all right.

1174
01:24:44,550 --> 01:24:45,718
Come in.

1175
01:24:47,136 --> 01:24:49,055
Great! It's arrived.

1176
01:24:49,430 --> 01:24:51,683
Don't open it yet. Wait for me.

1177
01:24:52,016 --> 01:24:53,851
Put it down there. That'll do fine.

1178
01:24:53,893 --> 01:24:55,270
All right, ma'am.

1179
01:24:55,728 --> 01:24:56,813
That's it.

1180
01:24:58,398 --> 01:24:59,524
Here I come.

1181
01:25:01,025 --> 01:25:02,402
Thank you.

1182
01:25:02,443 --> 01:25:05,446
I still have no idea who it could be from.

1183
01:25:06,239 --> 01:25:08,408
This is really gonna surprise you.

1184
01:25:11,369 --> 01:25:12,412
Open it.

1185
01:25:13,246 --> 01:25:14,956
- But what is it?
- Open it.

1186
01:25:17,166 --> 01:25:18,376
Money!

1187
01:25:19,669 --> 01:25:22,088
I saw it in the Grand High Witch's room.

1188
01:25:22,171 --> 01:25:25,133
I figured we could use it
when we go to America.

1189
01:25:27,427 --> 01:25:28,636
America?

1190
01:25:29,345 --> 01:25:31,264
We've got to go home because...

1191
01:25:31,889 --> 01:25:32,890
Look!

1192
01:25:35,351 --> 01:25:37,061
It was the Grand High Witch's.

1193
01:25:37,145 --> 01:25:40,356
It has the name and address
of every witch in America.

1194
01:25:47,905 --> 01:25:50,074
You are a genius.

1195
01:25:55,580 --> 01:26:00,001
"It doesn't matter who you are
and what you are

1196
01:26:00,084 --> 01:26:02,420
"As long as somebody loves you"

1197
01:26:03,504 --> 01:26:04,297
Luke.

1198
01:26:04,380 --> 01:26:05,882
What a day.

1199
01:26:06,883 --> 01:26:09,594
Perhaps we could find a good witch...

1200
01:26:09,636 --> 01:26:11,679
...to turn you back into my grandson.

1201
01:26:11,763 --> 01:26:14,933
I'll never be able to drive a real car, will I?

1202
01:26:15,475 --> 01:26:16,768
I don't know.

1203
01:26:16,893 --> 01:26:18,686
How long do mice live?

1204
01:26:18,978 --> 01:26:22,523
I hope we have time to take on
those American witches.

1205
01:26:23,483 --> 01:26:24,817
Shall we go to New York?

1206
01:26:24,901 --> 01:26:26,736
I've never been to New York.

1207
01:26:31,157 --> 01:26:32,742
Can we travel by ship?

1208
01:26:33,409 --> 01:26:35,119
First class.

1209
01:26:35,370 --> 01:26:36,704
The best cabin.

1210
01:26:36,996 --> 01:26:39,248
The best of everything.

1211
01:26:42,627 --> 01:26:44,253
Good night, Grandma.

1212
01:26:45,505 --> 01:26:46,839
Good night, Luke.

1213
01:26:59,102 --> 01:27:01,813
I really am happy to be a mouse,
you know.

1214
01:27:03,773 --> 01:27:06,192
I know, my darling.

1215
01:27:53,364 --> 01:27:54,616
Grandma!

1216
01:27:55,908 --> 01:27:57,660
Grandma, what's happening?

1217
01:28:40,244 --> 01:28:43,539
Off you go, back home to Luke.

1218
01:28:46,918 --> 01:28:48,795
Look, they're back!

1219
01:28:56,427 --> 01:28:58,513
Don't forget Bruno!
