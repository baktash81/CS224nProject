1
00:01:40,634 --> 00:01:41,865
Head cocked to the left.

2
00:01:42,152 --> 00:01:43,375
Partial deafness in ear.

3
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:45,311
First point of attack.

4
00:01:48,157 --> 00:01:49,928
Two. Throat. Paralyze vocal cords.
Stop screaming.

5
00:01:51,313 --> 00:01:53,719
Three. Got to be heavy drinker.
Floating rib to the liver.

6
00:01:54,813 --> 00:01:57,688
Four. Finally, drag the
left leg. Fist the patella.

7
00:01:59,375 --> 00:02:02,888
Summary prognosis: 
Conscious in 90 seconds
Martial efficacy: quarter of an hour at best.

8
00:02:03,502 --> 00:02:05,742
Full faculty of recovery: unlikely.

9
00:03:19,441 --> 00:03:21,724
- I like the hat.
- I just picked it up.

10
00:03:22,649 --> 00:03:23,996
You remember your revolver?

11
00:03:24,434 --> 00:03:25,590
Knew I forgot something.

12
00:03:26,449 --> 00:03:28,524
- I thought I'd left the stove on.
- You did.

13
00:03:31,522 --> 00:03:32,570
I think that's quite enough.

14
00:03:33,727 --> 00:03:35,103
You're a doctor, after all.

15
00:03:41,053 --> 00:03:42,198
Always nice to see you,
Watson.

16
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:46,855
Where's the inspector?

17
00:03:47,744 --> 00:03:49,001
Getting his troops lined up.

18
00:03:50,281 --> 00:03:51,137
That could be all day.

19
00:04:50,154 --> 00:04:51,549
Sherlock Holmes.

20
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,331
And his loyal dog.

21
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,644
Tell me, doctor

22
00:04:57,031 --> 00:04:59,677
As a medical man,
have you enjoyed my work?

23
00:05:00,407 --> 00:05:02,125
Let me show you how much
I've enjoyed it.

24
00:05:03,271 --> 00:05:04,770
Watson! Don't!

25
00:05:09,115 --> 00:05:10,522
Observe.

26
00:05:13,773 --> 00:05:14,939
How did you see that?

27
00:05:16,037 --> 00:05:17,439
Because I was looking for it.

28
00:05:22,254 --> 00:05:23,400
Lord Blackwood!

29
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:26,462
You seem surprised.

30
00:05:27,068 --> 00:05:29,477
I'd say the girl deserves
attention more than he.

31
00:05:31,132 --> 00:05:32,068
Indeed.

32
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,410
Oh, I'd leave that alone
if I were you, boyo.

33
00:05:41,443 --> 00:05:42,568
Good lad.

34
00:05:43,477 --> 00:05:45,068
Impeccable timing,
Lestrade.

35
00:05:46,662 --> 00:05:49,570
We've one for the doctor...
and one for the rope.

36
00:05:50,407 --> 00:05:51,948
- Clarky.
- Sir?

37
00:05:51,948 --> 00:05:53,937
This woman needs
a hospital immediately.

38
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:56,793
- Put her in the back of the Maria.
- Right, lads. That's it.

39
00:05:57,462 --> 00:06:01,681
Pick him up lads.

40
00:06:03,434 --> 00:06:04,732
If you don't mind.

41
00:06:06,981 --> 00:06:08,135
Get him out of my sight.

42
00:06:14,139 --> 00:06:15,950
And you were supposed
to wait for my orders.

43
00:06:16,818 --> 00:06:19,263
If I had, you'd be
cleaning up a corpse.

44
00:06:19,701 --> 00:06:20,951
and chasing a rumor.

45
00:06:21,452 --> 00:06:24,311
Besides, the girl's parents
hired me, not the Yard.

46
00:06:24,563 --> 00:06:27,262
Why they thought you would
require any assistance is beyond me.

47
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:31,201
Well, London will breathe a sigh of relief.
- Indeed.

48
00:06:31,507 --> 00:06:33,817
- Congratulations, Lestrade.
- Bravo, Inspector.

49
00:06:34,017 --> 00:06:35,259
Have a cigar.

50
00:06:35,643 --> 00:06:36,760
Gentlemen ...

51
00:06:37,077 --> 00:06:38,363
Cheese!

52
00:07:14,591 --> 00:07:16,418
156 over 80.

53
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:17,604
Very good.

54
00:07:18,276 --> 00:07:20,690
Me nerves are the best they've been
in years, thanks to you.

55
00:07:21,854 --> 00:07:23,138
Tell me something:

56
00:07:23,529 --> 00:07:26,690
Your new premises...
when are you moving in?

57
00:07:27,077 --> 00:07:28,432
I should be in
within the week.

58
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,407
Cavendish Place.

59
00:07:31,309 --> 00:07:32,546
And there will be a woman's 
touch too.

60
00:07:32,971 --> 00:07:34,388
Well, that's marvelous, indeed.

61
00:07:35,984 --> 00:07:37,282
Good God!

62
00:07:38,967 --> 00:07:41,285
- That was gunfire!
- No no.

63
00:07:42,391 --> 00:07:43,672
Hammer on nail, wasn't it?

64
00:07:44,233 --> 00:07:46,796
My colleague, probably ...
just putting up a painting.

65
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:48,862
I'll go and check.

66
00:07:49,984 --> 00:07:51,300
- Your colleague?
- Yes

67
00:07:52,204 --> 00:07:53,522
He won't be moving with you, will he?

68
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:55,947
No, he won't!

69
00:07:59,643 --> 00:08:00,661
Mrs. Hudson ...

70
00:08:00,988 --> 00:08:03,758
I won't go in there by myself!
Not while he's got a gun in his hand!

71
00:08:04,052 --> 00:08:06,348
You don't have to go in there at all.
Give me the paper.

72
00:08:06,348 --> 00:08:07,883
What will I do when
you leave, Doctor?

73
00:08:07,883 --> 00:08:09,229
He'll have the whole house down!

74
00:08:09,229 --> 00:08:10,676
He just needs another case,
that's all.

75
00:08:11,211 --> 00:08:12,490
Could you have a longer engagement?

76
00:08:13,584 --> 00:08:16,918
I smell gunpowder. This is not right you know!
Not in a domestic environment.

77
00:08:18,349 --> 00:08:20,116
Thank you, Captain Phillip.

78
00:08:20,493 --> 00:08:22,100
Perhaps a nice
cup of tea ...

79
00:08:22,576 --> 00:08:23,795
Same time next week.

80
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,787
Come along, Captain.
It's quiet downstairs.

81
00:08:26,787 --> 00:08:28,863
Mrs. Hudson?
Bring something to cheer him up.

82
00:08:39,536 --> 00:08:41,621
Permission to enter
the armory

83
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:43,474
Granted.

84
00:08:45,631 --> 00:08:48,912
Watson, I am in the process 
of inventing a device

85
00:08:49,122 --> 00:08:51,024
that supresses the sound
... of a gunshot.

86
00:08:54,604 --> 00:08:55,747
It's not working.

87
00:08:56,902 --> 00:08:58,312
Can I see that?

88
00:09:06,481 --> 00:09:09,918
You know it's been three months
since your last case?

89
00:09:14,199 --> 00:09:16,498
Gently. Gently, Watson.
Be gentle with me.

90
00:09:19,339 --> 00:09:21,016
I do think it's time
you found another one.

91
00:09:23,889 --> 00:09:25,203
I can't but agree.

92
00:09:25,438 --> 00:09:27,982
My mind embellishes, technician,
giving me problems, giving me work.

93
00:09:29,255 --> 00:09:30,390
The sooner the better.

94
00:09:31,281 --> 00:09:33,078
Paper.

95
00:09:34,047 --> 00:09:35,785
Let's see that.
There's a letter here.

96
00:09:38,672 --> 00:09:39,861
Mrs. Ramsey... of Queen's Park.

97
00:09:40,101 --> 00:09:41,330
Her husband's disappeared.

98
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,071
He's in Belgium, with the scullery maid.

99
00:09:44,064 --> 00:09:45,050
Is it November?

100
00:09:46,033 --> 00:09:47,955
Yes, Holmes.
What?

101
00:09:48,439 --> 00:09:50,454
Lady Radford reports ...

102
00:09:51,422 --> 00:09:53,715
oh, her emerald bracelet
has disappeared.

103
00:09:53,989 --> 00:09:55,238
It is an insurance swindle.

104
00:09:55,238 --> 00:09:57,362
Lord Radford likes fast women
and slow ponies.

105
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,600
I see you are the attending physician
at Blackwood's hanging. 

106
00:10:02,194 --> 00:10:02,912
Yes

107
00:10:03,349 --> 00:10:04,452
It was our last case together

108
00:10:04,452 --> 00:10:05,878
and I wanted to see it through to the end.

109
00:10:13,881 --> 00:10:14,954
A Mr. Louis ...

110
00:10:15,165 --> 00:10:18,244
I'm thinking of one case
that intrigues me at present.

111
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,177
The Curious Case of Mrs. Hudson

112
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:22,242
The absentee landlady.

113
00:10:22,581 --> 00:10:24,300
I've been studying her comings and goings.

114
00:10:24,801 --> 00:10:28,535
- And they appear to be most...sinister.
- Tea, Mr. Holmes?

115
00:10:28,941 --> 00:10:30,303
Is it poisoned, "nanny"?

116
00:10:30,819 --> 00:10:32,366
There's enough of that in you already.

117
00:10:32,863 --> 00:10:34,942
Don't touch.
Everything is in its proper place.

118
00:10:35,605 --> 00:10:37,802
As usual, "nanny".

119
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:41,068
Oop. He's killed the dog ...
again.

120
00:10:41,835 --> 00:10:43,584
What have you done to Gladstone,
now?

121
00:10:44,148 --> 00:10:46,295
I was simply testing
a new anesthetic.

122
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:48,398
He doesn't mind.

123
00:10:50,881 --> 00:10:51,858
Holmes

124
00:10:52,181 --> 00:10:53,399
as your doctor ...

125
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:54,897
Hell be straight as a trivet in no time.

126
00:10:54,897 --> 00:10:56,274
As your friend!

127
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:01,311
You've been in this room for two weeks.
I insist, you have to get out.

128
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:05,047
There is nothing of interest,
for me, out there on Earth.
At all.

129
00:11:05,509 --> 00:11:09,498
- So, you're free this evening?
- Absolutely.

130
00:11:09,838 --> 00:11:10,962
- Dinner?
- Wonderful.

131
00:11:10,962 --> 00:11:12,370
- The Royale?
- My favorite.

132
00:11:12,746 --> 00:11:13,776
Mary's coming.

133
00:11:15,294 --> 00:11:17,234
- Not available.
- You're meeting her, Holmes!

134
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:21,184
Have you proposed yet?

135
00:11:21,888 --> 00:11:23,404
No, I haven't found the right ring.

136
00:11:23,404 --> 00:11:24,685
So it's official.

137
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,486
It's happening, whether
yo like it or not.

138
00:11:27,719 --> 00:11:28,937
8:30, the Royale.

139
00:11:28,937 --> 00:11:30,630
- Wear a jacket.
- You wear a jacket.

140
00:12:07,036 --> 00:12:08,005
- Holmes!
- Hmm?

141
00:12:09,871 --> 00:12:11,068
You're early.

142
00:12:12,492 --> 00:12:13,512
Fashionably.

143
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:16,286
Miss Mary Morsten.

144
00:12:16,286 --> 00:12:17,978
Ahh, my goodness. What a pleasure.

145
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:22,539
For the life of me I don't know why it has taken
so long for him to intoduce us properly.

146
00:12:22,978 --> 00:12:23,976
The pleasure is mine.

147
00:12:29,322 --> 00:12:31,650
It's really is quite a thrill to
meet you, Mr. Holmes.

148
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:33,945
I've heard so much about you.

149
00:12:35,091 --> 00:12:38,000
I have a pile of detective novels
at home: of Collins, Poe ...

150
00:12:38,417 --> 00:12:39,262
It's true.

151
00:12:39,816 --> 00:12:41,450
It can seem a little farfetched 
though at some times

152
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:45,028
making these grand assumptions
out of such tiny details.

153
00:12:45,028 --> 00:12:46,608
That's not quite right, is it?

154
00:12:47,355 --> 00:12:49,973
In fact, the little details
are by far the most important.

155
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:56,069
- Take Watson ...
- I intend to.

156
00:12:58,983 --> 00:13:01,160
See his walking stick over there?
African snakewood?

157
00:13:01,798 --> 00:13:03,987
Hiding a blade of high tensile steel.

158
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,753
A few were rewarded to veterans 
of the Afghan War.

159
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:10,234
so I can assume he is 
a decorated soldier.

160
00:13:10,835 --> 00:13:12,536
Strong, brave, brave
born to be an adventurer.

161
00:13:13,909 --> 00:13:15,581
and neat,
as all military men.

162
00:13:15,881 --> 00:13:18,082
Now, I check his pockets.

163
00:13:20,697 --> 00:13:22,212
Ahh! A stub from a boxing match.

164
00:13:22,212 --> 00:13:24,675
Now, I can infer that 
he's a bit of a gambler.

165
00:13:24,978 --> 00:13:26,854
I 'd keep an eye on that dowry
if I were you.

166
00:13:26,854 --> 00:13:28,833
- Those days are behind me.
- Right behind you.

167
00:13:29,414 --> 00:13:31,072
It's cost us the rent
more than once.

168
00:13:31,788 --> 00:13:34,776
Well, with all due respect, Mr. Holmes,
You know John very well.

169
00:13:35,302 --> 00:13:37,050
What about a complete stranger?

170
00:13:38,396 --> 00:13:39,739
What can you tell about me?

171
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:41,303
- You?
- I don't think that's ...

172
00:13:41,303 --> 00:13:42,788
- I don't know that that's ...
- Not at dinner.

173
00:13:42,788 --> 00:13:44,118
- Perhaps another time.
- I insist.

174
00:13:44,358 --> 00:13:45,804
- You insist?
- Do you remember we discussed this>

175
00:13:45,804 --> 00:13:47,259
The lady insists.

176
00:13:54,493 --> 00:13:56,011
- You are a governess.
- Well done.

177
00:13:56,011 --> 00:13:58,368
Yes, well done.
Should we ... Waiter!

178
00:13:58,368 --> 00:14:01,182
Your student ...
It's a boy of eight.

179
00:14:01,871 --> 00:14:03,431
Charlie is seven, actually.

180
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:06,826
Then he's tall for his age.
He flicked ink at you today.

181
00:14:08,517 --> 00:14:11,548
- Is there ink on my face?
- There is nothing wrong with your face.

182
00:14:11,903 --> 00:14:13,551
There are two drops on your ear, in fact.

183
00:14:13,988 --> 00:14:15,793
India blue is almost
impossible to wash off.

184
00:14:16,372 --> 00:14:18,312
Anyway, a very impetuous act by the boy,

185
00:14:18,312 --> 00:14:20,714
which you have experienced many times, 
which is why

186
00:14:20,714 --> 00:14:23,208
the lady for whom you work
lent you that necklace.

187
00:14:23,622 --> 00:14:26,079
Pearls, diamonds, flawless ruby, hardly ...

188
00:14:26,655 --> 00:14:28,368
the gems of a governess.

189
00:14:31,655 --> 00:14:33,811
However, that jewels you are not wearing
tells us rather more

190
00:14:33,811 --> 00:14:35,297
- Holmes!
- You were engaged.

191
00:14:36,483 --> 00:14:39,673
The ring has gone, but the lightness of
the skin where it once sat suggests

192
00:14:39,673 --> 00:14:41,830
you spent some time abroad
wearing it proudly

193
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:44,189
that is, until you were informed
of its true and rather modest worth,

194
00:14:44,549 --> 00:14:47,082
at which point you broke off the 
engagement you returned to England 
for a better prospect.

195
00:14:47,409 --> 00:14:50,691
A doctor, perhaps?

196
00:14:57,810 --> 00:15:00,645
You're right on all counts,
Mr. Holmes, but for one.

197
00:15:03,733 --> 00:15:04,982
I didn't leave him.

198
00:15:05,982 --> 00:15:07,048
He died.

199
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:18,883
Well done, old boy.

200
00:16:47,474 --> 00:16:48,140
Stand up and fight!

201
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,235
Come on!

202
00:16:49,642 --> 00:16:51,906
Get up!

203
00:17:04,726 --> 00:17:06,064
That's it, big man.
We're done.

204
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:08,288
You've won. Congratulations.

205
00:17:09,641 --> 00:17:10,893
Oi! We ain't done yet.

206
00:17:16,409 --> 00:17:17,954
This mustn't register
on an emotional level.

207
00:17:20,394 --> 00:17:21,793
First, distract target.

208
00:17:23,432 --> 00:17:24,833
Then block his blind jab.

209
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:27,294
Counter with cross to left cheek.

210
00:17:28,271 --> 00:17:30,435
Discombobulate.

211
00:17:31,521 --> 00:17:34,416
Dazed, he'll attempt wild haymaker.
Employ elbow block.
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:36,602
And body shot.

212
00:17:37,587 --> 00:17:38,899
Block thorough left.

213
00:17:39,276 --> 00:17:40,383
Weaken that jaw.

214
00:17:42,055 --> 00:17:43,476
Now fracture.

215
00:17:45,463 --> 00:17:46,930
Break cracked ribs.

216
00:17:47,481 --> 00:17:48,776
Traumamatize solar plexus.

217
00:17:49,767 --> 00:17:51,608
Dislocate jaw entirely.

218
00:17:54,644 --> 00:17:55,996
Heel kick to diaphragm.

219
00:17:58,238 --> 00:17:59,765
In summary: ears ringing,

220
00:18:00,011 --> 00:18:02,728
jaw fractured, three ribs
cracked, four broken,

221
00:18:02,728 --> 00:18:04,877
diaphragm hemorrhaging.

222
00:18:04,877 --> 00:18:05,932
Physical recovery: 6 weeks.

223
00:18:06,239 --> 00:18:08,215
Full psychological recovery: 6 months.

224
00:18:08,751 --> 00:18:10,173
Capacity to spit at back of head...

225
00:18:10,486 --> 00:18:12,004
Neutralized.

226
00:18:40,934 --> 00:18:42,030
Where did that come from?

227
00:19:22,131 --> 00:19:23,596
What the hell is going on here, Charley?

228
00:19:24,337 --> 00:19:26,433
Lord Blackwood put him under
some kind of spell, sir.

229
00:19:26,634 --> 00:19:28,460
Looks like he's burning
from the inside out!

230
00:19:33,382 --> 00:19:34,411
Shut up!

231
00:19:35,493 --> 00:19:36,726
Charley. Charley!

232
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:39,304
Take this man to the infirmary!
Now!

233
00:19:51,959 --> 00:19:53,712
What's this all about then, Blackwood?

234
00:19:58,443 --> 00:19:59,972
There's someone I want to see.

235
00:20:21,265 --> 00:20:23,012
- Watson?
- Right.

236
00:20:23,868 --> 00:20:24,743
Let's go.

237
00:20:25,742 --> 00:20:27,492
What started merely as an experiment

238
00:20:27,856 --> 00:20:30,056
has brought me to the threshold
of a monumental discovery.

239
00:20:30,993 --> 00:20:32,717
Now, If I play a chromatic scale

240
00:20:34,182 --> 00:20:36,016
there's no measurable response.

241
00:20:36,486 --> 00:20:39,028
You do know what you're drinking 
is meant for eye surgery?

242
00:20:39,495 --> 00:20:40,670
But ... now,

243
00:20:41,122 --> 00:20:42,296
and this is remarkable

244
00:20:42,527 --> 00:20:45,278
if I change to atonal clusters.

245
00:20:47,088 --> 00:20:48,183
Voila! 

246
00:20:48,558 --> 00:20:50,094
They fly in counter-clockwise

247
00:20:50,094 --> 00:20:51,809
synchronized concentric circles.

248
00:20:51,809 --> 00:20:53,920
It is a regimented flock.

249
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,033
Watson, this is exceptional.

250
00:20:55,033 --> 00:20:58,935
I, using musical theory,
have created order from chaos.

251
00:21:01,739 --> 00:21:02,912
How do you lure them in?

252
00:21:03,412 --> 00:21:04,371
Excellent question.

253
00:21:04,911 --> 00:21:07,536
Individually.
I've been at it for six hours.

254
00:21:08,616 --> 00:21:09,933
And what happens if I do this?

255
00:21:14,474 --> 00:21:15,507
- Right.
- Clean yourself up.

256
00:21:16,038 --> 00:21:17,600
You are Blackwood's last request.

257
00:21:30,413 --> 00:21:31,978
Look at those towering structures.

258
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:36,347
It's the first combination of Bascule's
suspension bridge ever attempted.

259
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,168
Most innovative.

260
00:21:41,752 --> 00:21:43,293
What an industrious empire!

261
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:47,201
Oh, I have your winnings from last night.

262
00:21:49,637 --> 00:21:51,565
You weren't there, 
so I made your customary bet.

263
00:21:53,953 --> 00:21:56,063
You're right.
I'll keep it with your checkbook,

264
00:21:56,063 --> 00:21:57,609
locked safely away in my drawer.

265
00:22:00,358 --> 00:22:02,453
Did you know that the opera house
is featuring "Don Giovanni"?

266
00:22:03,171 --> 00:22:05,047
I could easily have procured a couple of tickets

267
00:22:05,047 --> 00:22:07,630
If you have any cultural 
inclinations this evening.

268
00:22:10,832 --> 00:22:12,976
You have a grand gift of silence, Watson.

269
00:22:12,976 --> 00:22:15,329
That makes you quite 
invaluable as a companion.

270
00:22:18,699 --> 00:22:20,208
I knew she'd been engaged.

271
00:22:21,082 --> 00:22:22,458
She told me.

272
00:22:22,736 --> 00:22:24,035
So that's no to the opera, then.

273
00:22:30,801 --> 00:22:31,848
That was my waistcoat.

274
00:22:31,848 --> 00:22:33,926
I thought we agreed that
it's too small for you.

275
00:22:33,926 --> 00:22:35,418
- I would like it back.
- I thought we agreed.

276
00:22:35,761 --> 00:22:36,896
I want it back.

277
00:23:10,293 --> 00:23:11,281
This way, Mr. Holmes.

278
00:23:13,341 --> 00:23:17,060
Blackwood certainly seems to have got
the crowd in something of a fear frenzy.

279
00:23:17,332 --> 00:23:19,718
Well, I'm certain it will disperse
once his feet have stopped twirling.

280
00:23:20,953 --> 00:23:22,060
Care to come along?

281
00:23:22,592 --> 00:23:23,935
No, you are on your own, old cock.

282
00:23:23,935 --> 00:23:25,707
I had no business with him
when he was alive.

283
00:23:26,019 --> 00:23:27,235
Suit yourself, "mother hen".

284
00:23:40,721 --> 00:23:43,126
It seems that you have 
lots of rooms to let.

285
00:23:43,676 --> 00:23:45,050
Yes. Had to move the prisoners,
sir.

286
00:23:45,565 --> 00:23:47,439
Otherwise we would 
have a riot on our hands.

287
00:23:47,439 --> 00:23:51,440
He has a peculiar effect
on the inmates as though...

288
00:23:53,769 --> 00:23:55,278
he can get inside their heads.

289
00:23:59,024 --> 00:24:02,035
I'm sure I can find my own way
if you have other duties to perform.

290
00:24:02,618 --> 00:24:04,193
Much obliged, sir.
Thank you, sir.

291
00:24:06,021 --> 00:24:13,684
And I stood upon the sand of the sea, 
and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, 

292
00:24:13,884 --> 00:24:16,819
having seven heads and ten horns, 
and upon his horns ten crowns,

293
00:24:17,402 --> 00:24:18,289
and upon his heads the name of blasphemy,

294
00:24:18,289 --> 00:24:19,758
and they worshipped the dragon 
which gave power unto the beast

295
00:24:19,758 --> 00:24:21,039
and they worshipped the beast, saying, 

296
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:22,479
Who is like unto the beast? 

297
00:24:22,479 --> 00:24:24,183
...the beast which I just saw
had the body of a leopard, 

298
00:24:24,183 --> 00:24:27,010
but had feet of a bear
and the mouth was the mouth of a lion.

299
00:24:27,273 --> 00:24:30,778
The dragon gave his power unto the beast,
and his seat and his authority.

300
00:24:31,246 --> 00:24:32,871
I love what you've done with the place.

301
00:24:35,137 --> 00:24:36,966
So glad you can accept my invitation.

302
00:24:37,984 --> 00:24:39,606
I have just a small point of concern.

303
00:24:41,436 --> 00:24:42,451
How can I help?

304
00:24:42,451 --> 00:24:44,199
I've already followed the murders
with some interest

305
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:46,797
And while my heart went out 
primarily to the families of the victims,

306
00:24:46,797 --> 00:24:48,734
I can not but notice
the criminal mastery

307
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,577
in the stroking of your brush.

308
00:24:51,629 --> 00:24:52,763
You are too kind.

309
00:24:52,763 --> 00:24:54,797
However, by comparison,
your work in the crypt

310
00:24:55,141 --> 00:24:57,596
was more akin to
a finger painting.

311
00:25:01,173 --> 00:25:03,736
So now you're curious
as to whether there's a logicum afoot?

312
00:25:04,142 --> 00:25:05,641
Either that or ...

313
00:25:07,769 --> 00:25:09,456
Shortly my friend will
pronounce you dead

314
00:25:09,456 --> 00:25:10,987
and I'm thought to maybe
keep you company.

315
00:25:11,769 --> 00:25:13,613
Your mistake is to imagine

316
00:25:13,613 --> 00:25:15,454
that anything earthly
led us to this moment.

317
00:25:15,674 --> 00:25:17,896
Your error in judgment is to assume 
that I'm holding the brush at all.

318
00:25:17,896 --> 00:25:20,489
I'm merely the channel.

319
00:25:20,848 --> 00:25:22,739
My only wish was that
I could have caught you sooner.

320
00:25:23,147 --> 00:25:25,729
Five lives might
have been spared.

321
00:25:27,545 --> 00:25:28,981
Those lives were a necessity.

322
00:25:30,602 --> 00:25:31,857
Sacrifice.

323
00:25:32,801 --> 00:25:35,682
Five otherwise meaningless creatures
called to serve a higher purpose.

324
00:25:35,983 --> 00:25:38,399
I wonder if they'd let Watson 
and me dissect your brain?

325
00:25:38,711 --> 00:25:40,178
After you hang, of course.

326
00:25:41,929 --> 00:25:45,900
I am sure that is some deformity 
that would be scientifically significant.

327
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:48,357
Then you too could serve
a greater purpose.

328
00:25:50,308 --> 00:25:52,837
Holmes, you must
widen  your case.

329
00:25:53,555 --> 00:25:57,499
I'm concerned you underestimate
the gravity of coming events.

330
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:03,184
You and I are ebound together a journey that
will wist the very fabric of nature.

331
00:26:04,638 --> 00:26:07,643
But beneath your mask of logic
I sense a fragility ...

332
00:26:09,049 --> 00:26:10,467
... that worries me.

333
00:26:11,768 --> 00:26:13,560
Steel your mind, Holmes.

334
00:26:15,178 --> 00:26:16,528
I need you.

335
00:26:16,528 --> 00:26:19,281
I say, you've come a long way
down from the House of Lords.

336
00:26:19,281 --> 00:26:20,752
- I will rise again.
- "Bon voyage".

337
00:26:20,752 --> 00:26:22,063
Pay attention!

338
00:26:22,341 --> 00:26:25,115
Three more will die and there is nothing
you can do to save them.

339
00:26:25,952 --> 00:26:27,927
You must accept that this
is beyond your control.

340
00:26:29,157 --> 00:26:31,614
By the time you realize
you made all this possible

341
00:26:32,907 --> 00:26:34,906
it will be the last sane thought
in your head.

342
00:26:43,784 --> 00:26:45,081
What did he want?

343
00:26:45,597 --> 00:26:46,694
I'm not sure.

344
00:26:47,192 --> 00:26:49,557
But I dont think you'will
need it, Father. Not for this one.

345
00:26:52,035 --> 00:26:55,661
Lord Henry Blackwood,
you are sentenced to death

346
00:26:56,506 --> 00:26:58,351
for the practice of black magic,

347
00:26:58,851 --> 00:27:01,212
the unholy murder of
five innocent young women,

348
00:27:01,212 --> 00:27:04,772
and attempted murder of a sixth.

349
00:27:05,398 --> 00:27:07,341
Do you have any final words?

350
00:27:08,276 --> 00:27:12,509
Death ... is only the beginning.

351
00:27:48,171 --> 00:27:50,295
That is the end of
Lord Blackwood.

352
00:28:12,634 --> 00:28:14,520
London is so bleak
this time of year.

353
00:28:16,136 --> 00:28:18,300
Not that I'm pining for
New Jersey,

354
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:21,179
Much prefer to travel in the winter.

355
00:28:24,662 --> 00:28:27,147
Here, I brought you these.
All the way from Syria.

356
00:28:27,823 --> 00:28:30,615
I found these exquisite dates
in Jordan

357
00:28:30,615 --> 00:28:32,087
and your favorite ...

358
00:28:32,928 --> 00:28:34,795
olives from the Cyclades.

359
00:28:35,571 --> 00:28:37,226
I thought we might have
a little tea party...

360
00:28:37,779 --> 00:28:40,493
and while I was setting the table,
I found this.

361
00:28:41,618 --> 00:28:43,232
a file with my name on it.

362
00:28:44,461 --> 00:28:46,730
"The theft of Velasquez'
portrait of the King of Spain.

363
00:28:48,057 --> 00:28:51,484
"and missing naval documents
lead to the resignation 
of the Bulgarian prime minister

364
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:56,137
Scandalous affair
and engagement of ... "

365
00:28:56,434 --> 00:29:02,373
"perhaps to both
Romanov princes."

366
00:29:03,996 --> 00:29:06,371
Simply studying your methods.

367
00:29:06,919 --> 00:29:08,748
In the event the authorities should 
ask me to hunt you down.

368
00:29:10,613 --> 00:29:13,030
But I don't see my name in 
any of these articles.

369
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:14,813
But your signature was clear.

370
00:29:16,544 --> 00:29:18,452
Is that the Maharaja's missing diamond?

371
00:29:19,897 --> 00:29:21,845
Or just another souvenir?

372
00:29:22,373 --> 00:29:24,173
Let's not dwell on the past.

373
00:29:25,831 --> 00:29:26,960
Shall we?

374
00:29:29,816 --> 00:29:32,236
Now, by the look of things,
I'd say you were between jobs.

375
00:29:32,236 --> 00:29:33,586
And you between husbands.

376
00:29:34,111 --> 00:29:35,349
How much did you give for the ring?

377
00:29:35,349 --> 00:29:38,224
He was boring, jealous,
and he snored.

378
00:29:39,618 --> 00:29:43,879
I'm Irene Adler again.

379
00:29:51,568 --> 00:29:52,788
Thank you.

380
00:29:59,342 --> 00:30:00,869
I need your help.

381
00:30:01,616 --> 00:30:03,342
I need you to find someone.

382
00:30:06,196 --> 00:30:07,631
Why are you always so suspicious?

383
00:30:07,631 --> 00:30:10,343
Should i answer chronologically
or alphabetically?

384
00:30:10,695 --> 00:30:13,445
Careful not to cut yourself
on this lethal envelope.

385
00:30:17,696 --> 00:30:19,728
I think you will find all the
information you need inside

386
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:22,885
Who are you working for?

387
00:30:24,859 --> 00:30:26,794
So, I'll have to find
out the hard way.

388
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:29,951
Keep your money,
I didn't say that I'd take the case.

389
00:30:29,951 --> 00:30:32,169
Well consider it a wager that you will.

390
00:30:34,045 --> 00:30:35,925
Do you emember the Grand?

391
00:30:35,925 --> 00:30:37,674
They gave me our old room.

392
00:30:52,176 --> 00:30:54,439
Hold the door.
Thanks, doctor.

393
00:31:17,944 --> 00:31:19,197
Ma'am.

394
00:31:23,077 --> 00:31:25,273
- He'll do it.
- Well done, Miss Adler.

395
00:31:27,257 --> 00:31:29,169
That's precisely why
I hired you.

396
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:32,694
I'll wager he will have our man
within the next 24 hours.

397
00:31:33,336 --> 00:31:34,421
He'd better.

398
00:31:34,998 --> 00:31:37,193
Reordan is the key to what
Blackwood was doing.

399
00:31:38,212 --> 00:31:39,874
He's essential to my plan.

400
00:31:42,883 --> 00:31:45,274
What's she doing?
Can't you see where you're going?

401
00:31:45,871 --> 00:31:47,297
Get off out of it!

402
00:31:48,648 --> 00:31:53,341
A liitle will go a long way, sir.

403
00:31:55,738 --> 00:31:56,341
Rubbing these callouses off this 
...

404
00:31:56,341 --> 00:31:57,798
God save the queen!

405
00:31:58,027 --> 00:31:59,342
God save the Queen, sir.

406
00:31:59,559 --> 00:32:00,589
Get off out of it!

407
00:32:04,644 --> 00:32:06,084
Look at you.

408
00:32:06,653 --> 00:32:08,113
The only woman you ever cared about...

409
00:32:08,113 --> 00:32:09,547
a world class criminal.

410
00:32:09,547 --> 00:32:10,623
Are you a masochist?

411
00:32:10,623 --> 00:32:11,716
Allow me to explain ...

412
00:32:11,954 --> 00:32:12,926
Allow me!

413
00:32:12,926 --> 00:32:15,957
She is the only adversary who
ever outsmarted you ... twice.

414
00:32:16,952 --> 00:32:18,439
Made a proper idiot out of you.

415
00:32:18,717 --> 00:32:19,906
Right. You've had your fun.

416
00:32:19,906 --> 00:32:22,063
- What's she want, anyway?
- Time to press on.

417
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,804
What could she possibly need?

418
00:32:24,469 --> 00:32:25,630
It doesn't matter.

419
00:32:25,836 --> 00:32:28,442
A beard.
A human canoe.

420
00:32:28,848 --> 00:32:31,285
She could sit on her back
and paddle you up the Thames.

421
00:32:31,785 --> 00:32:34,706
This is no consequence to you.

422
00:32:34,706 --> 00:32:36,035
We've done our last case together.

423
00:32:36,333 --> 00:32:37,253
I've already read it.

424
00:32:38,757 --> 00:32:39,908
Missing person.

425
00:32:40,598 --> 00:32:41,598
Luke Reordan.

426
00:32:41,879 --> 00:32:44,599
4 foot ten, red hair, no front teeth.
Case solved.

427
00:32:45,537 --> 00:32:46,724
You obviously do not have time.

428
00:32:47,368 --> 00:32:48,476
She likes ginger dwarfs.

429
00:32:48,756 --> 00:32:49,756
Midgets.

430
00:32:49,756 --> 00:32:51,163
- So, you agree.
- No, I don't agree.

431
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:53,821
It's more than a technicality.

432
00:32:54,726 --> 00:32:57,185
You are misrepresenting the dimensions
of foreshortened peoples.

433
00:32:57,968 --> 00:32:59,602
I've said too much.
I can tell. I've upset you.

434
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:01,476
No, I'm just stating that one has...

435
00:33:01,476 --> 00:33:03,163
What are you doing?

436
00:33:03,163 --> 00:33:05,530
- Will you allow me to explain?
- I wish you would.

437
00:33:29,418 --> 00:33:31,535
- Holmes? What are you doing?
- Nothing.

438
00:33:32,246 --> 00:33:33,903
- Are you wearing a false nose?
- A false nose? No.

439
00:33:34,218 --> 00:33:37,204
Tell me, if that was ...

440
00:33:37,628 --> 00:33:40,795
Holmes! Where you going?

441
00:33:45,515 --> 00:33:46,546
Watson?

442
00:33:47,891 --> 00:33:49,657
Help! Watson!

443
00:34:09,488 --> 00:34:11,175
Got some flowers for you, sweetheart.

444
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:13,428
Cut you a deal
because you're so pretty.

445
00:34:15,113 --> 00:34:16,572
Oh, my lucky day!

446
00:34:18,073 --> 00:34:20,093
I got gold if you do some for me.

447
00:34:24,606 --> 00:34:25,990
Do not move!

448
00:34:29,929 --> 00:34:31,233
Now what have we got here?

449
00:34:36,828 --> 00:34:38,117
Thank you.

450
00:34:39,277 --> 00:34:40,930
That's the Irene I knew.

451
00:35:33,569 --> 00:35:35,818
This plan intrigues me me, Watson.
He's got Adler on edge.

452
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:37,520
Which is no mean feat.

453
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,660
She's intimidated
She's scared of him.

454
00:35:40,099 --> 00:35:41,380
Yet she works for him.

455
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,200
Right.

456
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:47,055
It's nothing to do with me, but I'd advise 
you to leave the case alone.

457
00:35:48,087 --> 00:35:49,463
Well, I may not have a choice. Hmm?

458
00:35:50,506 --> 00:35:53,416
After all, I may be paying the rent alone
soon, thanks to you.

459
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:55,430
Get that out of my face.

460
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:56,852
It's not in your face.
It's in my hand.

461
00:35:57,072 --> 00:35:58,635
Get what is in your hand
out of my face.

462
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,498
- Mr. Holmes!
- Clarky!

463
00:36:00,498 --> 00:36:02,882
Sir, Inspector Lestrade asks that you
come with me at once.

464
00:36:03,093 --> 00:36:05,009
What's he done now?
Lost his way to Scotland Yard?

465
00:36:06,031 --> 00:36:07,933
Watson, grab a compass.
You means us.

466
00:36:08,345 --> 00:36:09,699
No, you means you.

467
00:36:09,915 --> 00:36:11,466
It's about Lord Blackwood,
sir. He ...

468
00:36:12,448 --> 00:36:16,471
It appears he's come
back from the grave, sir.

469
00:36:26,262 --> 00:36:27,859
- Most engaging.
- Very clever.

470
00:36:28,264 --> 00:36:30,030
I pronounced the man dead myself.

471
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:33,534
What are the facts?

472
00:36:33,534 --> 00:36:36,639
Groundskeeper claims he saw him walking
through the graveyard just this morning, sir.

473
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:39,314
I'll leave this in your capable hands.

474
00:36:40,518 --> 00:36:42,063
I have an appointment with Mary.

475
00:36:42,265 --> 00:36:44,234
It's not my reputation that's at stake here.

476
00:36:44,766 --> 00:36:47,003
Don't try that.

477
00:36:47,003 --> 00:36:49,738
Have the newspapers got wind of it yet?

478
00:36:50,862 --> 00:36:51,925
Well, that's what we're trying to avoid, sir.

479
00:36:51,925 --> 00:36:52,509
Certainly.

480
00:36:52,509 --> 00:36:55,583
- What's the major concern?
- Panic. Sheer, bloody panic, sir.

481
00:36:55,799 --> 00:36:56,989
Indeed.

482
00:36:57,193 --> 00:36:58,832
You're not taking this seriously,
are you Holmes?

483
00:36:58,832 --> 00:37:00,958
Yes.
As you should.

484
00:37:02,288 --> 00:37:04,271
It's a matter of
professional integrity.

485
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:06,916
No girl wants to
marry a doctor who

486
00:37:06,916 --> 00:37:08,742
can't tell if a man
is dead or not.

487
00:37:25,109 --> 00:37:26,804
Who do you think won the match,
Clarky?

488
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:29,077
- Sir?
- The rugby match.

489
00:37:30,369 --> 00:37:33,789
Your boys have done a magnificent job
of obliterating any potential evidence.

490
00:37:34,274 --> 00:37:36,526
Yes, but at least they never
miss an opportunity

491
00:37:36,775 --> 00:37:38,278
to miss an opportunity.

492
00:37:41,231 --> 00:37:42,705
You took the time, Holmes.

493
00:37:42,705 --> 00:37:45,327
<i> And on the third day ...</ i> </ i></i>

494
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:50,549
These slabs were sandstone,
half a ton each, if they're a pound,

495
00:37:50,549 --> 00:37:53,048
and they're smashed open from the inside.

496
00:37:53,687 --> 00:37:55,372
Lestrade. What of the coffin?

497
00:37:56,439 --> 00:37:58,278
We are in the process of
bringing it up now.

498
00:37:58,278 --> 00:37:59,419
I see. Hmpf.

499
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:02,397
Right.

500
00:38:02,656 --> 00:38:04,811
At what stage of the process?
Contemplative?

501
00:38:07,466 --> 00:38:08,865
And how is our witness?

502
00:38:09,459 --> 00:38:10,501
He's over there.

503
00:38:10,935 --> 00:38:14,628
And apparently he's cata..
cat ...

504
00:38:14,628 --> 00:38:15,690
Catatonic, sir.

505
00:38:16,835 --> 00:38:18,157
- He's not feeling very well.
- Yes.

506
00:38:21,252 --> 00:38:24,866
Now if you lot don't stop behaving like
a bunch of quivering milkmaids
you're on double time.

507
00:38:25,246 --> 00:38:28,005
Now you get down there and
you bring that coffin up ...
Now!

508
00:38:28,558 --> 00:38:30,159
Good day, sir!

509
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:35,757
All right.

510
00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:38,273
I'm a doctor.

511
00:38:48,695 --> 00:38:50,186
The man's in shock.

512
00:38:50,406 --> 00:38:52,885
He may need a few moments.

513
00:38:52,885 --> 00:38:55,150
The witness stated that he saw 
Lord Blackwood rising from the grave.

514
00:38:56,290 --> 00:38:58,166
- Well?
- Well?

515
00:38:58,557 --> 00:39:00,016
You pronounced him dead.

516
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:02,854
He had no pulse.

517
00:39:24,344 --> 00:39:25,716
Good lord.

518
00:39:27,466 --> 00:39:28,829
That's not Blackwood!

519
00:39:31,172 --> 00:39:33,857
Well, now we have a firm grasp
of the obvious.

520
00:39:38,922 --> 00:39:40,173
Time of death?

521
00:39:42,658 --> 00:39:44,408
Diptera is approximately ...

522
00:39:45,503 --> 00:39:49,269
2/3 of an inch

523
00:39:49,269 --> 00:39:52,487
which would put the time of death
between ten and twleve hours ago.

524
00:39:53,852 --> 00:39:55,394
May I borrow your pen?

525
00:40:00,464 --> 00:40:02,131
- Headless dwarf.
- Midget.

526
00:40:12,718 --> 00:40:14,369
I know what I saw!

527
00:40:15,792 --> 00:40:17,154
It was Blackwood!

528
00:40:18,634 --> 00:40:20,199
As clear as I see you.

529
00:40:22,813 --> 00:40:24,620
And when the dead walk...

530
00:40:26,188 --> 00:40:28,512
the living will fill these coffins.

531
00:40:31,483 --> 00:40:32,575
Well ...Um...

532
00:40:36,575 --> 00:40:39,138
Right. Put the lid on it 
and clean this lot up.

533
00:40:40,201 --> 00:40:41,925
You really believe he was resurrected?

534
00:40:42,201 --> 00:40:45,109
The question is not "if" but "how."
The game's afoot.

535
00:40:45,575 --> 00:40:48,029
"follow your spirit and upon this charge

536
00:40:48,029 --> 00:40:50,298
cry God for Harry, England
and St. George."

537
00:40:57,313 --> 00:40:59,569
Why that certain fish and chips store,
I don't understand.

538
00:40:59,569 --> 00:41:02,083
That particular beer they use.
A northern stout to be exact.

539
00:41:02,883 --> 00:41:03,925
You know, Holmes

540
00:41:04,363 --> 00:41:06,541
I've seen things in war
I don't understand.

541
00:41:06,541 --> 00:41:09,072
In India, I once met a man
who predicted his own death

542
00:41:09,072 --> 00:41:12,709
right down to the number and placement
of the bullets that killed him.

543
00:41:14,135 --> 00:41:15,395
You have to admit, Holmes,

544
00:41:15,706 --> 00:41:20,729
that a supernatural explanation
to this case, is theoretically possible.

545
00:41:21,741 --> 00:41:22,710
No, agreed, but ...

546
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:25,962
it is a huge mistake to theorize
before one has data.

547
00:41:26,357 --> 00:41:29,576
Inevitably, one begins to twist facts
to suit theory

548
00:41:29,576 --> 00:41:31,148
instead of theories to suit facts.

549
00:41:31,398 --> 00:41:34,431
That said, I believe our midget
is the key to this.

550
00:41:36,951 --> 00:41:39,982
Right. Scratches around the 
keyhole where the watch is wound.

551
00:41:40,307 --> 00:41:41,307
What does that tell you?

552
00:41:41,307 --> 00:41:43,119
The man was likely
a drunk.

553
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:46,056
Every time he wound the watch,
his hand would slip and hence the scratch.

554
00:41:46,056 --> 00:41:47,745
- Yes.
- Very good, Watson.

555
00:41:47,745 --> 00:41:49,904
You have developed considerable
deductive powers of your own.

556
00:41:50,281 --> 00:41:54,683
Let's see now. There are several
sets of initials scored..

557
00:41:54,683 --> 00:41:56,059
- Pawn brokers mark.
- Excellent.

558
00:41:56,291 --> 00:41:59,918
The mostb recent of which are
"M.H. M.H. M.H. .. ..

559
00:42:00,279 --> 00:42:02,187
- is for ...
- "Maddison and Haig."

560
00:42:07,155 --> 00:42:08,560
They should be able to give us an address.

561
00:42:13,502 --> 00:42:14,770
What a coincidence.

562
00:42:16,366 --> 00:42:18,842
There is one thing you've failed to deduce
from the watch, Holmes.

563
00:42:18,842 --> 00:42:20,097
Really? I think not.

564
00:42:20,616 --> 00:42:21,522
The time.

565
00:42:21,522 --> 00:42:22,960
I have to get back, Holmes.

566
00:42:23,959 --> 00:42:25,774
Taking tea with the in-laws.

567
00:42:26,336 --> 00:42:28,126
- Predicting your future, sir?
- Absolutely not.

568
00:42:28,690 --> 00:42:29,816
No thank you, ma'am.

569
00:42:29,816 --> 00:42:31,158
You need to hear what I have to tell you.

570
00:42:31,158 --> 00:42:33,493
We have no need of your
lucky hela, gypsy woman.

571
00:42:33,493 --> 00:42:35,182
Even if it's to do with Mary?

572
00:42:42,552 --> 00:42:43,962
I see two men.

573
00:42:44,505 --> 00:42:47,569
Brothers. Not in blood, but in bond. 

574
00:42:51,663 --> 00:42:52,778
What of Mary?

575
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:55,664
And from Mary.
For marriage. Oh, you will be married.

576
00:42:57,780 --> 00:42:58,715
Go on.

577
00:42:59,507 --> 00:43:03,697
I see patterned table cloths and...

578
00:43:03,697 --> 00:43:05,468
chain of figurines ...

579
00:43:06,031 --> 00:43:07,917
lace doilies...

580
00:43:08,439 --> 00:43:09,899
Doilies.

581
00:43:10,415 --> 00:43:12,071
Lace doilies, Holmes.

582
00:43:13,092 --> 00:43:16,541
- Does your depravity know no bounds?
- No.

583
00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:19,697
Oh, she turns to fat and 
she has a beard 
and she has a big wart...

584
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:21,380
What of the warts?

585
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:22,823
- She is covered in warts.
- Enough!

586
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:25,377
- Are they extensive?
- Please, enough!

587
00:43:29,492 --> 00:43:31,251
It's a most apt prediction Flora has made,

588
00:43:31,705 --> 00:43:33,878
And precisely the reason
you can't find a suitable ring.

589
00:43:34,693 --> 00:43:35,675
Do you have my money?

590
00:43:35,675 --> 00:43:38,068
You are terrified of a life
without the thrill of the macabre.

591
00:43:38,068 --> 00:43:39,223
Do you have my money?

592
00:43:39,223 --> 00:43:40,851
- Admit it! Admit it!
- Give me my money!

593
00:43:40,851 --> 00:43:42,278
Holmes.

594
00:43:45,629 --> 00:43:46,847
I see.

595
00:43:52,509 --> 00:43:53,642
Thank you.

596
00:43:56,586 --> 00:43:59,342
You've got your ring and 
I've got my address for the ginger midget.

597
00:43:59,805 --> 00:44:00,785
Should be just there.

598
00:44:00,785 --> 00:44:04,316
I think she'll really like this.

599
00:44:04,567 --> 00:44:06,372
And I have some change in my pocket.

600
00:44:11,132 --> 00:44:13,092
- Shall I look after it for you?
- No no.

601
00:44:14,937 --> 00:44:16,663
- Don't give it away here.
- No.

602
00:44:17,287 --> 00:44:18,684
I have to go see Mary.

603
00:44:19,311 --> 00:44:20,638
Give her my best.

604
00:44:22,075 --> 00:44:23,342
And the family as well.

605
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:06,083
It does make a considerable difference
to me having  

606
00:45:06,432 --> 00:45:09,037
someone with me on whom 
I can thoroughly rely.

607
00:45:09,659 --> 00:45:11,517
Well, you can rely on me
for exactly 10 minutes.

608
00:45:14,911 --> 00:45:16,943
He clearly felt something
would come after him.

609
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:18,745
Something did.

610
00:45:20,246 --> 00:45:21,693
Irene Adler was here,

611
00:45:22,185 --> 00:45:25,447
Either that, or the ginger midget 
wore the same Parisian perfume.

612
00:45:27,256 --> 00:45:31,403
Ahhh, putrefaction.

613
00:45:36,318 --> 00:45:39,539
Ammonium sulphate,
among other aromas.

614
00:45:43,977 --> 00:45:45,243
Phosphorus.

615
00:45:46,947 --> 00:45:48,249
Formaldehyde.

616
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:04,957
It looks like...
he was attempting to combine

617
00:46:05,754 --> 00:46:08,894
some kind of sorcery
and scientific formula.

618
00:46:17,016 --> 00:46:18,733
More impotantly...

619
00:46:19,374 --> 00:46:21,330
let's see what he was trying to dispose of.

620
00:46:23,205 --> 00:46:24,581
Potassium, magnesium.

621
00:46:24,581 --> 00:46:25,969
Sultafitic acid.

622
00:46:25,969 --> 00:46:29,134
Try to take the ion out of the ink
As long as it's not too burnt.

623
00:46:44,863 --> 00:46:46,285
Peculiar.

624
00:46:48,637 --> 00:46:50,354
Hydrated rhododendron.

625
00:47:15,965 --> 00:47:19,370
Holmes.
Look at the crest.

626
00:47:21,073 --> 00:47:22,771
Reordan was working with Blackwood.

627
00:47:23,122 --> 00:47:24,101
Of course he was.

628
00:47:24,868 --> 00:47:26,959
The question is...
to what end?

629
00:47:31,149 --> 00:47:33,883
Whatever he was working on...
He clearly succeeded.

630
00:47:34,639 --> 00:47:35,508
How so?

631
00:47:36,102 --> 00:47:37,774
Otherwise, he'd still
be alive.

632
00:47:38,510 --> 00:47:41,218
Which is why Miss Adler
is so desperate to find him.

633
00:47:41,218 --> 00:47:42,157
Yes.

634
00:47:42,901 --> 00:47:46,043
There's one odor I can't
quite put my finger on.

635
00:47:46,043 --> 00:47:47,533
Is it candy floss?
Molasses?

636
00:47:48,577 --> 00:47:49,606
Maple syrup.

637
00:47:51,636 --> 00:47:53,026
- Brown sugar!
- Toffee.
- Apple.

638
00:47:58,831 --> 00:48:00,098
Let me guess.

639
00:48:00,326 --> 00:48:03,046
Judging by your arsenous tool kit,

640
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:06,036
You're here to burn down the building
and extinguish all evidence therein.

641
00:48:06,999 --> 00:48:08,264
Just one minute, boys.

642
00:48:09,312 --> 00:48:10,893
Oh, Dredger!

643
00:48:26,515 --> 00:48:27,851
There a problem?

644
00:48:30,995 --> 00:48:32,339
Meat ...

645
00:48:32,339 --> 00:48:34,056
or potatoes?

646
00:48:34,524 --> 00:48:35,870
My ten minutes are up.

647
00:49:29,786 --> 00:49:30,912
You all right?

648
00:50:25,316 --> 00:50:26,359
Come!

649
00:50:46,783 --> 00:50:47,893
Holmes.

650
00:50:48,856 --> 00:50:49,988
What is that?

651
00:54:18,409 --> 00:54:19,614
Holmes!

652
00:55:13,516 --> 00:55:14,758
Watson ...

653
00:55:15,356 --> 00:55:16,992
What on earth have you done?

654
00:55:28,829 --> 00:55:30,207
I haven't slept all night.

655
00:55:30,829 --> 00:55:32,126
Not a wink.

656
00:55:34,049 --> 00:55:35,579
Why I ever believed ...

657
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:39,833
That I would get to have tea
with Mary's parents

658
00:55:40,709 --> 00:55:42,918
is beyond me, having been talkind 
into going with you.

659
00:55:43,567 --> 00:55:44,818
We could say it was in self-defense.

660
00:55:44,818 --> 00:55:49,482
I've been reviewing my notes,
our exploits over tha last seven months.

661
00:55:49,482 --> 00:55:50,748
Would you like to know my conclusion?

662
00:55:51,327 --> 00:55:53,570
I am psychologically disturbed.

663
00:55:53,994 --> 00:55:54,850
How so?

664
00:55:54,850 --> 00:55:59,234
Why else would I continually 
be led into situations

665
00:55:59,234 --> 00:56:02,587
where you deliberately 
withhold your plans for me?

666
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:03,338
Why else?

667
00:56:04,608 --> 00:56:07,522
You never complained about
my methods before.

668
00:56:08,139 --> 00:56:09,573
- I'm not complaining.
- You're not?

669
00:56:09,901 --> 00:56:10,983
What do you call this?

670
00:56:10,983 --> 00:56:12,872
How am I complaining?
I never complain!

671
00:56:12,872 --> 00:56:15,422
When do I complain about yout practicing
the violin at 3 in the morning?

672
00:56:15,667 --> 00:56:18,122
Or your mess, or your
general lack of hygiene

673
00:56:18,122 --> 00:56:19,776
or the fact that you steal my clothes?

674
00:56:19,776 --> 00:56:20,994
We have a barter system.

675
00:56:20,994 --> 00:56:23,731
When do I complain about you
setting fire to my rooms?

676
00:56:23,731 --> 00:56:24,967
Our rooms.

677
00:56:24,967 --> 00:56:27,747
The rooms. When do I complain that
you experiment on my dog?

678
00:56:27,747 --> 00:56:29,669
- Our dog.
- On the the dog!
- It's our dog!

679
00:56:29,669 --> 00:56:35,707
What I do take issue with is your
campaign to sabotage my relationship
with Mary.

680
00:56:43,467 --> 00:56:44,836
I understand.

681
00:56:45,126 --> 00:56:46,192
- Do you?
- I do.

682
00:56:47,970 --> 00:56:49,801
- I don't think you do.
- You're overtired.

683
00:56:50,909 --> 00:56:52,471
- Yes
- You're feeling a bit sensitive.

684
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:54,241
I'm not sensitive.

685
00:56:54,241 --> 00:56:56,084
What you need is a rest.

686
00:56:56,471 --> 00:56:58,963
My brother, Mycroft,
has a small estate near Chichester.

687
00:56:59,282 --> 00:57:01,119
Beautiful grounds.
There's a falls ...

688
00:57:02,238 --> 00:57:04,035
We could throw a lamb on the spit.

689
00:57:04,035 --> 00:57:07,560
We? Holmes, if I were to go to the 
country it would be with my future wife.

690
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:08,930
Well, certainly, if we must ...

691
00:57:08,930 --> 00:57:11,099
Not you, Mary and I!

692
00:57:11,099 --> 00:57:12,886
- You are not ...
- What? Invited?

693
00:57:13,275 --> 00:57:16,318
Why would I not be invited to my
own brother's country home, Watson?

694
00:57:16,318 --> 00:57:18,507
- You are not making any sense!
- You're not human!

695
00:57:18,817 --> 00:57:21,974
- John Watson?
- Yes.

696
00:57:22,947 --> 00:57:24,632
Your bail has been posted.

697
00:57:30,728 --> 00:57:31,948
Mary!

698
00:57:35,625 --> 00:57:37,011
Just Watson.

699
00:57:45,124 --> 00:57:48,886
I hope you get bail by breakfast,
because boys are getting hungry.

700
00:57:59,335 --> 00:58:00,722
Back off! Back off!

701
00:58:01,294 --> 00:58:04,469
To which the barman says:
"May I push in your stool?"

702
00:58:07,609 --> 00:58:09,234
Not you. You're out.

703
00:58:10,046 --> 00:58:13,097
- Until next time.
- Always a pleasure, Mr. Holmes.

704
00:58:15,170 --> 00:58:17,821
Thank heaven you're here, Lestrade
I'd almost ran out of jokes.

705
00:58:17,821 --> 00:58:19,894
You know, in another life,
you'd have made an excellent criminal.

706
00:58:19,894 --> 00:58:21,445
Yes, and you, sir,
an excellent policeman.

707
00:58:21,445 --> 00:58:22,861
Tomsky! Thank you.

708
00:58:24,924 --> 00:58:26,724
Please tell me you have answers.

709
00:58:27,502 --> 00:58:29,863
All in good time, Lestrade.

710
00:58:29,863 --> 00:58:32,863
All in good time? What is this, some parlor game
where we have to guess what your're thinking?

711
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:35,050
I've got a public in frenzy out there

712
00:58:35,050 --> 00:58:37,269
now if you don't fill me in
I'll have you in there 

713
00:58:37,269 --> 00:58:39,387
playing Victoria and Albert
quicker than a bookie's runner.

714
00:58:40,504 --> 00:58:42,491
Now, clean up and make yourself presentable.

715
00:58:43,725 --> 00:58:45,036
For whom?

716
00:58:45,036 --> 00:58:46,543
I have friends in high places.

717
00:58:46,543 --> 00:58:47,866
They're the ones
who bailed you out of there.

718
00:58:59,638 --> 00:59:02,180
I'm terribly sorry to 
inconvenience you, sir.

719
00:59:02,961 --> 00:59:04,735
But I'm going to have
to put this on you.

720
00:59:09,106 --> 00:59:12,887
Mr. Holmes, apologies
for summoning you like this.

721
00:59:13,892 --> 00:59:16,955
I'm sure it's quite a mystery as to
where you are and who I am.

722
00:59:17,903 --> 00:59:19,529
As to where I am ...

723
00:59:19,779 --> 00:59:23,294
I was admittedly lost for a moment,
between Charing Cross and Holborn,

724
00:59:23,294 --> 00:59:26,450
but I was saved by the bread shop
on Saffron Hill.

725
00:59:26,873 --> 00:59:32,093
the only baker to use a certain 
French glaze on their loaves,
a Brittany sage.

726
00:59:32,093 --> 00:59:33,845
After that the carriage fork left
and right

727
00:59:33,845 --> 00:59:36,185
a telltale bump at the fleet conduit

728
00:59:36,597 --> 00:59:38,624
As to who you are

729
00:59:38,624 --> 00:59:40,813
it took every ounce of my not
inconsiderabile experience.

730
00:59:41,178 --> 00:59:43,520
The letters on your desk are
addressed to Sir Thomas Rodrum.

731
00:59:44,461 --> 00:59:46,095
You are Chief Justice, that
would be your official title.

732
00:59:46,095 --> 00:59:50,753
Who you really are...
is of course is another matter entirely.

733
00:59:51,504 --> 00:59:53,469
Judging by the sacred ox on your ring

734
00:59:53,469 --> 00:59:55,722
you are the secret head
of the Temple of the Four Orders 

735
00:59:55,722 --> 00:59:57,580
into whose headquarters we now sit

736
00:59:58,004 --> 01:00:00,878
on the northwest corner
of St. James Square, I think.

737
01:00:01,472 --> 01:00:05,442
The only mystery that remains is
why you bothered to blindfold me at all.

738
01:00:08,122 --> 01:00:11,630
Yes ...
Well, standard procedure I suppose.

739
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:16,869
I dare say we have the
right man, gentlemen.

740
01:00:17,091 --> 01:00:17,944
Sherlock Holmes.

741
01:00:17,944 --> 01:00:21,091
Ambassador Standish from America,
and Lord Coward, the Home Sewcretary.

742
01:00:22,165 --> 01:00:26,092
I suppose you alraedy have some notion
as to the practices of our Order?

743
01:00:26,668 --> 01:00:27,685
Yes.

744
01:00:31,134 --> 01:00:32,200
Yes ... they are practically interesting.

745
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:35,796
You can be as skeptical as you like,
but our secret systems

746
01:00:35,796 --> 01:00:36,874
have steered the world for 
the greater good for centuries.

747
01:00:36,874 --> 01:00:39,125
The danger is they can be used
for more nefarious purposes.

748
01:00:40,278 --> 01:00:43,264
What some call the dark arts
or practical magic.

749
01:00:43,593 --> 01:00:46,405
We know you don't believe in magic,
Mr. Holmes.

750
01:00:47,154 --> 01:00:49,710
We don't expect you to share our faith,
merely

751
01:00:49,936 --> 01:00:51,300
our fears.

752
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:53,220
Fear is the 
more infectious condition

753
01:00:54,301 --> 01:00:55,779
in this instance.

754
01:00:58,583 --> 01:01:00,221
Fear of your own child.

755
01:01:03,654 --> 01:01:05,205
Blackwood is your son.

756
01:01:05,563 --> 01:01:10,393
You have the same irises, a rare dark green.
The diamond-shaped hazel flanks.

757
01:01:11,098 --> 01:01:15,004
Together with identical arterias
which are only passed down
through direct blood lines

758
01:01:15,004 --> 01:01:17,277
which makes you by necessity brothers

759
01:01:17,742 --> 01:01:20,589
or in this case,
more likely ... father and son.

760
01:01:25,659 --> 01:01:28,259
Very few people are privy 
to that information.

761
01:01:28,995 --> 01:01:32,130
And we want to keep it that way.

762
01:01:35,833 --> 01:01:37,775
He was conceived during one
of our rituals.

763
01:01:39,443 --> 01:01:40,381
His mother wasn't my wife.

764
01:01:40,381 --> 01:01:43,723
But she shared our beliefs.
She was a powerful practitioner.

765
01:01:44,268 --> 01:01:47,005
Though not enough to 
survive giving birth to him.

766
01:01:49,099 --> 01:01:50,842
Death followed him 
wherever he went.

767
01:01:51,162 --> 01:01:53,574
Those five girls were not the first
to be butchered.

768
01:01:53,574 --> 01:01:56,556
He killed many more using them 
to enhance his powers.

769
01:01:57,477 --> 01:02:00,216
No one could prove anything, of course,
but we all knew.

770
01:02:01,789 --> 01:02:03,886
The boy was a curse.

771
01:02:03,886 --> 01:02:06,101
We'd done our best to stop him 
ourselves, but it was not enough.

772
01:02:06,478 --> 01:02:08,904
His power grows daily.

773
01:02:08,904 --> 01:02:10,936
His resurrection is evidence of that.

774
01:02:10,936 --> 01:02:12,998
But what he does next will 
be far more dangerous.

775
01:02:13,375 --> 01:02:17,074
His secret lies in the book of spells.
This is the source of his power.

776
01:02:18,293 --> 01:02:21,012
He's going to raise a force that will 
alter the very course of the world.

777
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:23,938
I want you to find him and stop him
before he does.

778
01:02:24,951 --> 01:02:27,064
We'll give you any assistance that we can.

779
01:02:29,265 --> 01:02:32,754
As Home Secretary, I have considerable
influence over the police.

780
01:02:33,003 --> 01:02:36,440
So ...

781
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,733
Name your price.

782
01:02:41,078 --> 01:02:45,092
Well, of great benefit to being
a consulting detective is that I
can pick and choose my clients.

783
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:48,109
Consider it done.
I'll stop him.

784
01:02:49,564 --> 01:02:52,784
But not for you.
And certainly not for a price.

785
01:02:56,695 --> 01:02:59,237
I do have a parting query,
Sir Thomas.

786
01:02:59,550 --> 01:03:00,611
What is that?

787
01:03:00,611 --> 01:03:02,159
If the rest of his family
is dead...

788
01:03:02,990 --> 01:03:04,977
How long do you expect to survive?

789
01:03:05,862 --> 01:03:07,020
Food for thought.

790
01:03:32,148 --> 01:03:34,654
Well, perhaps you'll have
better luck opening that.

791
01:03:35,838 --> 01:03:38,586
Margaux. 58.
Comet vintage.

792
01:03:39,588 --> 01:03:42,931
How fascinating that an astronomical
event can affect the quality ...

793
01:03:43,557 --> 01:03:46,031
How is it going with our 
case you refuse to take?

794
01:03:46,642 --> 01:03:47,870
... wine.

795
01:03:48,901 --> 01:03:50,604
Oh, I've hit a dead end...
literally.

796
01:03:51,184 --> 01:03:56,600
I found your man.
He's buried in Blackwood's tomb.

797
01:03:58,215 --> 01:03:59,717
If you still need him.

798
01:04:01,615 --> 01:04:03,156
Oh dear...

799
01:04:04,608 --> 01:04:08,373
Hope my client doesn't come
looking for a refund.

800
01:04:08,971 --> 01:04:10,467
He's a professor, isn't he?

801
01:04:10,751 --> 01:04:13,000
I couldn't see his face, but I 
spotted a bit of chalk on his apparel.

802
01:04:13,719 --> 01:04:17,811
I've never known a teacher to carry a gun
and on such a clever contraption.

803
01:04:21,657 --> 01:04:24,079
Eyepatch.
Nice touch.

804
01:04:25,033 --> 01:04:27,361
So ... case closed.

805
01:04:27,361 --> 01:04:30,205
Which makes this a social visit.

806
01:04:30,616 --> 01:04:33,522
No. It's a your in over your
head Irene visit.

807
01:04:34,192 --> 01:04:36,745
Whoever killed Reordon 
was covering their tracks.

808
01:04:36,745 --> 01:04:40,463
which makes you the 
next loose end to be snipped.

809
01:04:41,068 --> 01:04:42,347
Let it breathe.

810
01:04:43,848 --> 01:04:45,880
I've never been in over my head.

811
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:48,903
Leave now. Disappear.
You're good at that.

812
01:04:49,631 --> 01:04:52,973
Or stay. And volunteer for 
protective custody.

813
01:04:57,007 --> 01:04:59,822
If I am in danger,
so are you.

814
01:05:03,804 --> 01:05:05,293
Come with me.

815
01:05:08,229 --> 01:05:10,106
What if we trusted each other?

816
01:05:11,855 --> 01:05:15,806
You're not listening.
I'm taking you...
either to the railway staion

817
01:05:16,418 --> 01:05:17,905
or the police station..

818
01:05:29,605 --> 01:05:31,171
So ...

819
01:05:34,891 --> 01:05:36,191
What is it to be?

820
01:05:38,052 --> 01:05:39,391
You decide.
Which will it be?

821
01:05:39,953 --> 01:05:44,375
I told you to let it breathe.

822
01:05:45,828 --> 01:05:47,201
Can you taste the comet?

823
01:05:53,815 --> 01:05:56,412
Why couldn't you just
come away with me?

824
01:07:44,751 --> 01:07:47,842
Madam, I need you to remain calm.

825
01:07:48,093 --> 01:07:50,920
Trust me, I'm a professional.
Beneath this pillow

826
01:07:51,217 --> 01:07:52,835
lies the key to my release.

827
01:07:53,872 --> 01:07:56,252
Of course, she misinterpreted
my intention entirely.

828
01:07:57,409 --> 01:08:01,625
- Naturally, sir.
- That's why I find this modern
religious fanaticism so troubling.

829
01:08:01,625 --> 01:08:02,522
There's no latitude
for misunderstandings.

830
01:08:02,522 --> 01:08:03,750
That's right. Rhyme over reason.

831
01:08:03,750 --> 01:08:06,062
And chambermaids were 
once such a liberal breed.

832
01:08:06,750 --> 01:08:08,099
My wife's a chambermaid.

833
01:08:11,117 --> 01:08:14,524
Anyway. Good thing she was a friend of Sarah's
or we might never have found you.

834
01:08:15,308 --> 01:08:17,804
The inspector's been over to
Baker Street himself this morning, sir.

835
01:08:22,785 --> 01:08:24,412
Just joking about the wife, sir.

836
01:08:29,568 --> 01:08:32,911
I've checked everything.
No sign of a break-in

837
01:08:34,132 --> 01:08:35,684
and the butler didn't hear a thing.

838
01:08:35,996 --> 01:08:38,312
Body in the nathtub.
His eyes are wide open

839
01:08:38,569 --> 01:08:40,193
and the only thing missing
was ...

840
01:08:41,725 --> 01:08:43,664
his ring, sir.

841
01:08:59,948 --> 01:09:01,629
Why did you drain the water?

842
01:09:01,629 --> 01:09:03,126
Out of common decency.

843
01:09:03,126 --> 01:09:04,855
Crime is common.
Logic is rare.

844
01:09:05,512 --> 01:09:08,608
The decent thing to do is to catch the killer
not to provide comfort for the corpse.

845
01:09:24,389 --> 01:09:25,817
What is that?

846
01:09:29,288 --> 01:09:30,539
Jasmine bath salt, sir.

847
01:09:30,539 --> 01:09:32,999
Superb. Probably comes from a
larger container.

848
01:09:33,475 --> 01:09:35,175
It will either be in the pantry

849
01:09:35,601 --> 01:09:38,678
high up, where it is warm and dry,
or in a linen cupboard with a vent.

850
01:09:38,678 --> 01:09:43,113
And constable, you could do worse
than to check the ground under the rear window

851
01:09:43,363 --> 01:09:45,003
for footprints that are not your own.

852
01:09:45,003 --> 01:09:47,706
Data, data, data. I cannot make
bricks without clay.

853
01:10:47,448 --> 01:10:48,683
Mr Holmes?

854
01:10:57,321 --> 01:10:58,899
Was it in the cupboard or the pantry?

855
01:10:59,787 --> 01:11:01,038
It was in the pantry, sir.

856
01:11:02,010 --> 01:11:03,697
I don't know what to make of this.

857
01:11:04,055 --> 01:11:05,187
Excellent work.

858
01:11:06,167 --> 01:11:07,386
Adieu. 

859
01:11:46,142 --> 01:11:48,330
What is the meaning of this, Coward?

860
01:11:48,330 --> 01:11:49,798
Why have you called this meeting?

861
01:11:50,298 --> 01:11:51,797
Sir Thomas is dead.

862
01:11:53,767 --> 01:11:56,800
I nominate Lord Blackwood
as head of the Order.

863
01:11:59,738 --> 01:12:01,081
Have you lost your mind?

864
01:12:02,111 --> 01:12:04,487
You know damned well what he is capable of.

865
01:12:04,487 --> 01:12:05,650
Of course he does.

866
01:12:08,021 --> 01:12:09,324
That's why we are here.

867
01:12:11,303 --> 01:12:12,897
That's why we are all here.

868
01:12:19,025 --> 01:12:21,490
My powers and my assets were
given to me for one purpose.

869
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:26,711
Magnificent ... but simple purpose.

870
01:12:28,214 --> 01:12:29,822
To create a new future.

871
01:12:30,992 --> 01:12:35,244
A future ... ruled ... by us.

872
01:12:38,462 --> 01:12:42,432
Tomorrow, at noon, we take the first step
towards a new chapter in our history.

873
01:12:44,932 --> 01:12:46,592
Magic will lead the way.

874
01:12:46,871 --> 01:12:48,839
Once the people of England
see our newfound power

875
01:12:48,839 --> 01:12:50,530
they will bow down in fear.

876
01:12:55,968 --> 01:12:59,186
Across the Atlantic lies
a colony that was once ours.

877
01:12:59,998 --> 01:13:01,491
It will be again.

878
01:13:02,232 --> 01:13:03,907
The Civil War has made them weak.

879
01:13:04,624 --> 01:13:08,905
Their government is as corrupt
and as ineffective as ours.

880
01:13:09,909 --> 01:13:11,311
So we'll take it back.

881
01:13:13,659 --> 01:13:15,485
We will remake the world.

882
01:13:17,674 --> 01:13:19,370
Create the future.

883
01:13:20,973 --> 01:13:23,503
These men are with me,
Standish.

884
01:13:24,595 --> 01:13:27,023
But ... are you?

885
01:13:28,412 --> 01:13:30,939
No, sir.
I am not.

886
01:13:32,285 --> 01:13:34,362
These powers that you are playing with ...

887
01:13:35,213 --> 01:13:37,552
no man can control.

888
01:13:39,504 --> 01:13:43,928
Well gentlemen,
someone has to stop them.

889
01:13:44,401 --> 01:13:48,990
Even if you won't.

890
01:13:49,343 --> 01:13:50,917
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

891
01:14:13,784 --> 01:14:16,573
Gentlemen ...
don't be afraid.

892
01:14:18,359 --> 01:14:22,597
As you can see,
we are protected.

893
01:14:24,936 --> 01:14:27,700
Come ... drink to your allegiance here.

894
01:14:33,829 --> 01:14:36,359
You control the police, 
now use them.

895
01:14:49,328 --> 01:14:50,736
I didn't know you were here.

896
01:14:50,736 --> 01:14:54,220
Since this room is no longer yours,
do you mind if I ... utilize it?

897
01:14:55,041 --> 01:14:56,612
Be my guest.

898
01:14:58,196 --> 01:15:00,740
- In here, chaps!
- Where do you want me to put it sir?

899
01:15:00,977 --> 01:15:02,427
Anywhere in here is fine.

900
01:15:13,208 --> 01:15:14,458
Who is he?

901
01:15:14,458 --> 01:15:16,366
He's the man who tried to kill
you at Reordan's lodgings.

902
01:15:16,805 --> 01:15:19,274
I suppose his neck didn't survive the
impact of Dredger landing on him.

903
01:15:20,138 --> 01:15:23,241
Yes ... Thanks for that, by the way.

904
01:15:26,141 --> 01:15:29,486
But there is some consolation in the knowledge
that he can still be of service to his fellow man.

905
01:15:34,611 --> 01:15:36,236
Elbow is long stained with blood.

906
01:15:36,478 --> 01:15:38,126
But it's ultimately his own injuries.

907
01:15:45,207 --> 01:15:49,503
I don't know if it's human. 
It's not a butcher. Let me see...

908
01:15:59,885 --> 01:16:01,896
Yellow Flame. Green burst.

909
01:16:02,634 --> 01:16:04,024
An industrial worker.

910
01:16:08,512 --> 01:16:10,805
Coal. River silt.

911
01:16:11,553 --> 01:16:14,243
And the stripe on his trousers
should put him squarely in ...

912
01:16:14,243 --> 01:16:15,680
Nine Elms.

913
01:16:15,899 --> 01:16:16,931
Sorry. What?

914
01:16:16,931 --> 01:16:18,985
The area you're looking for is Nine Elms.

915
01:16:21,445 --> 01:16:24,118
Do you remember where I put the 
Lord's registry of embassy interests?

916
01:16:24,792 --> 01:16:25,993
It's on the stepladder.

917
01:16:37,222 --> 01:16:40,372
Blackwood has had a dispatch at
anything that is corrosive to the spirit.

918
01:16:41,797 --> 01:16:43,281
Woolidge Arsenal.

919
01:16:43,529 --> 01:16:45,029
Limehouse Chemical Works.

920
01:16:45,029 --> 01:16:47,234
Probably be a factory
by the river.

921
01:16:47,234 --> 01:16:48,374
What's that?

922
01:16:49,185 --> 01:16:50,358
Never mind.

923
01:16:52,595 --> 01:16:54,175
You don't know where my 
rugby ball went, do you?

924
01:16:54,935 --> 01:16:56,271
No, not a clue.

925
01:16:56,625 --> 01:16:58,423
Queen's Heights slaughterhouse.

926
01:16:59,563 --> 01:17:00,984
Nine Elms.

927
01:17:01,348 --> 01:17:02,861
A factory by the river.

928
01:17:03,561 --> 01:17:05,501
Well done, Watson. That should 
lead us right to Blackwood.

929
01:17:05,910 --> 01:17:07,125
Dead or alive.

930
01:17:07,125 --> 01:17:08,411
Not us.

931
01:17:10,127 --> 01:17:11,521
You.

932
01:17:12,331 --> 01:17:13,489
Yes.

933
01:17:15,176 --> 01:17:16,504
Just a figure of speech, old boy.

934
01:17:26,506 --> 01:17:28,164
He's left it there on purpose.

935
01:17:59,847 --> 01:18:01,502
Glad to see that you two 
are working hard, then.

936
01:18:02,293 --> 01:18:04,280
And I thought we were 
trying to be discreet.

937
01:18:04,828 --> 01:18:07,841
You would not last 
one day in the navy!

938
01:18:11,079 --> 01:18:13,029
Holmes, are you sure there
is no other alternative means 

939
01:18:13,029 --> 01:18:14,879
of water transportation than that?

940
01:18:14,879 --> 01:18:17,406
I guarantee you no one knows
London's waterways better.

941
01:18:18,851 --> 01:18:20,412
Tim is practically a fish himself.

942
01:18:21,233 --> 01:18:22,532
Certainly drinks like one.

943
01:18:22,532 --> 01:18:24,395
Oh, you found a sense of humor, doctor.

944
01:18:24,850 --> 01:18:26,220
If only just a sense.

945
01:18:27,487 --> 01:18:30,408
Better take over here.
Bit tricky down here.

946
01:18:52,687 --> 01:18:53,799
Come on.

947
01:19:09,898 --> 01:19:11,157
- Look familiar?
- Yes.

948
01:19:11,627 --> 01:19:13,160
All that's missing is a ginger midget.

949
01:19:26,628 --> 01:19:28,068
They cleared something away from here.

950
01:19:28,068 --> 01:19:29,372
Not minutes ago.

951
01:19:29,372 --> 01:19:30,463
Like what?

952
01:19:31,101 --> 01:19:32,957
I'm not sure.
Something mechanical.

953
01:19:34,308 --> 01:19:36,192
Holmes.
976a
01:19:36,308 --> 01:19:37,980
Look at this.

954
01:20:02,322 --> 01:20:04,169
- 1:18
- Chapter and verse.

955
01:20:04,169 --> 01:20:07,200
Revelations. 1:18.
I am he that liveth, and was dead.

956
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:10,605
Behold I am alive, forevermore. 

957
01:20:12,902 --> 01:20:14,826
I warned you, Holmes, to accept 

958
01:20:14,826 --> 01:20:16,283
that this was beyond your control.

959
01:20:16,605 --> 01:20:19,073
Beyond what your rational 
mind could comprehend.

960
01:20:21,012 --> 01:20:23,637
What a busy afterlife you are having.

961
01:20:23,637 --> 01:20:25,110
I want you to be my witness.

962
01:20:25,499 --> 01:20:29,990
Tomorrow, at midday, 
the world as you know it...
will end.

963
01:20:30,422 --> 01:20:32,797
Show me your face and it will be
the end of your world right now.

964
01:20:33,064 --> 01:20:34,454
Save your bullet, Watson.

965
01:20:34,799 --> 01:20:36,627
A gift for you.

966
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:44,007
What wasd that about saving bullets?

967
01:20:50,868 --> 01:20:52,456
She followed you here, Holmes.

968
01:20:54,816 --> 01:20:57,126
You led your lamb to slaughter.

969
01:21:00,723 --> 01:21:01,681
Holmes!

970
01:21:03,519 --> 01:21:05,066
This game is designed to hurt.

971
01:21:17,071 --> 01:21:18,102
Watson!

972
01:21:22,685 --> 01:21:24,434
It's warm in here, Watson!

973
01:21:31,343 --> 01:21:32,790
In over your head yet, darling?

974
01:21:40,780 --> 01:21:42,353
- Hold on there!
- I can't!

975
01:21:42,625 --> 01:21:44,752
Let me take your weight.

976
01:21:45,326 --> 01:21:46,604
Give us a leg up, old boy.

977
01:21:49,700 --> 01:21:52,371
These German locks 
always give me trouble.

978
01:21:57,046 --> 01:21:58,386
It's a bandsaw.

979
01:22:02,216 --> 01:22:03,860
No matter. We have plenty of time.

980
01:22:06,036 --> 01:22:07,298
Holmes ...

981
01:22:15,238 --> 01:22:16,517
- It's not working!
- Keep calm.

982
01:22:25,906 --> 01:22:27,706
Holmes!
Hurry up!

983
01:22:34,607 --> 01:22:36,545
Don't get excited.

984
01:22:37,186 --> 01:22:38,500
Turn off that valve.

985
01:23:02,692 --> 01:23:04,226
And we bounce in three ...

986
01:23:04,472 --> 01:23:05,175
... two,

987
01:23:05,175 --> 01:23:06,772
... one.

988
01:23:17,853 --> 01:23:19,101
Thank you.

989
01:23:20,122 --> 01:23:21,477
I'm gonna get after Blackwood.

990
01:23:31,571 --> 01:23:32,759
Thank you.

991
01:23:33,446 --> 01:23:35,324
We should...help the doctor.

992
01:23:47,950 --> 01:23:49,389
Holmes!

993
01:25:50,076 --> 01:25:52,017
Lord Coward has issued a 
warrant for your arrest, sir.

994
01:25:54,524 --> 01:25:57,494
Watson is alive.
Just get out of here. Go,sir, now!

995
01:26:15,716 --> 01:26:17,154
Will the train be departing on time?

996
01:26:17,154 --> 01:26:19,249
The train's been delayed, madam.

997
01:26:19,841 --> 01:26:21,215
Shouldn't be long now though.

998
01:26:38,367 --> 01:26:41,157
The train will depart when I tell it to.

999
01:26:43,347 --> 01:26:46,627
And you will leave my employment 
when I allow you to.

1000
01:26:50,978 --> 01:26:52,623
I fulfilled my contract.

1001
01:26:53,592 --> 01:26:55,137
I found Reordan.

1002
01:26:55,137 --> 01:26:56,906
He's in Scotland Yard's mortuary.

1003
01:26:57,404 --> 01:26:58,769
So that's me finished.

1004
01:26:59,216 --> 01:27:02,498
Your job was to manipulate 
Holmes' feelings for you...

1005
01:27:03,187 --> 01:27:04,653
not succumb to them.

1006
01:27:07,717 --> 01:27:09,468
You have fulfilled nothing. 

1007
01:27:09,753 --> 01:27:12,442
I want what Reardon
was making for Blackwood. 

1008
01:27:12,928 --> 01:27:18,211
Finish the job, other the next dead
body will be Sherlock Holmes.

1009
01:27:46,155 --> 01:27:47,812
The surgeon should be along shortly.

1010
01:27:52,944 --> 01:27:54,430
You should be able to rest now.

1011
01:27:58,193 --> 01:27:59,685
Excuse me.

1012
01:28:03,723 --> 01:28:05,537
Is that the best you can do?

1013
01:28:05,816 --> 01:28:07,131
Yes, for now.

1014
01:28:07,974 --> 01:28:09,585
I must attend to my other patients.

1015
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:12,848
Doctor ...

1016
01:28:13,569 --> 01:28:14,660
Doctor!

1017
01:28:15,154 --> 01:28:16,873
Please!

1018
01:28:21,498 --> 01:28:23,280
I know that you care for 
him as much as I do.

1019
01:28:24,883 --> 01:28:26,994
This is not your responsibility.
It was his choice.

1020
01:28:29,242 --> 01:28:31,398
He'd say that it was worse than wounds.

1021
01:28:38,535 --> 01:28:39,943
Solve this!

1022
01:28:41,161 --> 01:28:42,592
Whatever it takes.

1023
01:28:57,787 --> 01:28:59,258
<i> It's Lord Blackwood, sir. </i>

1024
01:28:59,562 --> 01:29:01,289
<i>I've never been in over my head.</i>

1025
01:29:01,577 --> 01:29:04,064
<i> leave the case alone </i>

1026
01:29:04,064 --> 01:29:05,776
<i> you're not taking it seriously, Holmes. </i>

1027
01:29:06,001 --> 01:29:08,415
<i> beyond your control </i>

1028
01:29:08,634 --> 01:29:11,885
<i> tomorrow at midday, the world will end
public in frenzy </i>

1029
01:29:11,885 --> 01:29:13,152
<i> Holmes! </i>

1030
01:29:39,456 --> 01:29:42,976
<i> You and I are bound together on a journey 
that will twist the very fabric of nature. </i>

1031
01:29:43,484 --> 01:29:45,143
<i> steel your mind, Holmes. </i>

1032
01:29:46,696 --> 01:29:48,522
<i> ... force that will alter the
very course of the world </i>

1033
01:29:48,522 --> 01:29:49,829
<i> increases in power. </ I> </ i></i>
q

1034
01:29:49,829 --> 01:29:51,004
<i> ... is the source of his power. </ I> </ i></i>

1035
01:29:51,236 --> 01:29:52,110
<i> I need you. </ I> </ i></i>

1036
01:29:52,314 --> 01:29:53,882
<i> the secret lies in the book of spells. </i>

1037
01:30:22,329 --> 01:30:24,118
<i> Three more will die ...</ i> 

1038
01:30:25,649 --> 01:30:27,446
<i> and there is nothing you 
can do to save them </ i>

1039
01:30:28,993 --> 01:30:30,929
<i> we know you don't believe in magic. </i>

1040
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,444
<i> Reordon was working with Blackwood. </i>
1063a
01:30:36,724 --> 01:30:38,000
<i> something was coming to get him </i>

1041
01:30:41,181 --> 01:30:43,477
<i> the only thing missing was his ring </i>

1042
01:30:50,730 --> 01:30:52,605
<i> Give up, Holmes. </i>

1043
01:30:54,416 --> 01:30:56,855
<i> is a riddle that you cannot solve </i>

1044
01:31:03,359 --> 01:31:04,701
Good morning.

1045
01:31:08,136 --> 01:31:11,016
Now...you need to work.

1046
01:31:12,702 --> 01:31:14,170
Familiar artwork.

1047
01:31:16,358 --> 01:31:18,029
You look gorgeous.

1048
01:31:20,908 --> 01:31:22,735
Somehow I knew you wouldn't leave.

1049
01:31:32,019 --> 01:31:33,223
You made the front page.

1050
01:31:33,223 --> 01:31:34,770
Only a name and no picture?

1051
01:31:36,038 --> 01:31:39,884
So... it looks like you will need 
to work outside the law now...

1052
01:31:40,101 --> 01:31:43,446
and that's my area of expertise.

1053
01:31:43,446 --> 01:31:44,518
I feel safer already.

1054
01:31:46,855 --> 01:31:48,617
You seem to be making a rapid recovery.

1055
01:31:50,241 --> 01:31:51,522
Yes ...

1056
01:31:52,202 --> 01:31:54,193
Took the shrapnel out myself.

1057
01:31:54,764 --> 01:31:57,014
Mary said I had a lousy doctor.

1058
01:32:03,024 --> 01:32:05,804
Well then ...um... I'm just so very glad...

1059
01:32:06,427 --> 01:32:10,587
that...you're um...
well ...with us.

1060
01:32:16,024 --> 01:32:19,045
Now that you're sitting 
comfortably I shall begin.

1061
01:32:20,558 --> 01:32:23,470
My initial approach
was far too narrow.

1062
01:32:23,795 --> 01:32:25,857
When Blackwood invited me
to Pentonville prison

1063
01:32:25,857 --> 01:32:27,718
he suggested I widen my gaze

1064
01:32:27,718 --> 01:32:29,332
and at minimum I have done just that.

1065
01:32:29,902 --> 01:32:34,749
In fact, I may well have reconciled thousands
of years of theological dfisparity.

1066
01:32:36,364 --> 01:32:38,332
But that's for another time.

1067
01:32:38,959 --> 01:32:41,373
Blackwood's method is based
on a ritualistic mystical system

1068
01:32:41,373 --> 01:32:44,873
that's been employed by the Temple
of the Four Orders for centuries.

1069
01:32:45,222 --> 01:32:49,742
To fully understand the system,
to get inside it

1070
01:32:49,742 --> 01:32:51,796
I reenacted the ceremony
we interrupted at the crypt.

1071
01:32:52,361 --> 01:32:54,392
with a few enhancements of my own.

1072
01:32:55,595 --> 01:32:58,936
My journey took me so much farther down 
the rabbit hole than I had intended

1073
01:32:58,936 --> 01:33:01,835
and though I dirtied my fluffy white tail

1074
01:33:01,835 --> 01:33:04,401
I have emerged...enlightened.

1075
01:33:05,439 --> 01:33:08,275
A fraternity who silently 
controlled the Empire

1076
01:33:08,275 --> 01:33:11,239
shared the belief with the kings,
Pharaohs, and emperors of old

1077
01:33:11,524 --> 01:33:14,307
that the Sphinx was a door
to another dimension.

1078
01:33:14,536 --> 01:33:16,442
A gateway to an immeasurable power.

1079
01:33:16,728 --> 01:33:18,089
It's made up of four parts.

1080
01:33:18,341 --> 01:33:21,526
Thye foot of a lion, the tail of an ox,
the wings of an eagle

1081
01:33:22,035 --> 01:33:23,445
and the head of a man.

1082
01:33:23,786 --> 01:33:26,881
In Sir Thomas' secret chamber 
I found the bone of an ox

1083
01:33:27,104 --> 01:33:29,928
the tooth of a lion,
the feather of an eagle, 
and the hair of a man.

1084
01:33:30,475 --> 01:33:31,507
Map.

1085
01:33:35,506 --> 01:33:38,069
The points of the star represent 
the five murdered girls.

1086
01:33:38,384 --> 01:33:40,560
But the cross is what 
we are now interested in.

1087
01:33:41,512 --> 01:33:46,353
It's a widely held belief that within
the architecture of the great cities

1088
01:33:46,353 --> 01:33:48,635
a coded reference system exists.

1089
01:33:49,481 --> 01:33:52,066
Since he arose from the grave
Blackwood has killed three men.

1090
01:33:52,066 --> 01:33:56,060
Each murder was committed at a location
that has a direct connection with the temple.

1091
01:33:56,060 --> 01:33:57,656
Therefore ... the system.

1092
01:33:58,784 --> 01:34:01,286
Reardon, the ginger midget,
represents man.

1093
01:34:01,780 --> 01:34:03,312
We found his body ... here.

1094
01:34:04,607 --> 01:34:08,232
Sir Thomas ... master of the temple,
wore the ox ring.

1095
01:34:08,702 --> 01:34:10,224
He died here.

1096
01:34:10,985 --> 01:34:14,952
Standish, ambassador to America,
where the eagle has 

1097
01:34:15,186 --> 01:34:17,298
been the national emblem
for over a hundred years.

1098
01:34:17,519 --> 01:34:19,601
Headquarters for the Temple
of the Four Orders, where he died...

1099
01:34:20,425 --> 01:34:22,005
is here.

1100
01:34:23,485 --> 01:34:26,611
Correspondingly, the map will tell us
the location of Blackwood's final act.

1101
01:34:27,052 --> 01:34:31,647
So, we have man, the ox,  eagle, ...
only the lion remaining.

1102
01:34:32,641 --> 01:34:34,442
Right here.

1103
01:34:35,692 --> 01:34:37,019
Parliament.

1104
01:34:41,678 --> 01:34:46,635
Right. You four stay here,
the rest of you come with me.

1105
01:34:48,730 --> 01:34:50,114
Right this way.

1106
01:34:53,514 --> 01:34:54,993
Ladies first.

1107
01:34:57,996 --> 01:34:59,430
- Follow these instructions.
- Aren't you going?

1108
01:35:04,670 --> 01:35:06,526
Hello hello hello.

1109
01:35:07,398 --> 01:35:09,508
Did the devil turn up?

1110
01:35:10,712 --> 01:35:13,372
Well...Never mind.

1111
01:35:14,736 --> 01:35:16,300
You got the next best thing.

1112
01:35:39,933 --> 01:35:43,413
Beg your pardon, my lord.
I know that it's unorthodox.

1113
01:35:45,091 --> 01:35:49,509
But Mr. Holmes, here, has been making 
some serious accusations about you,

1114
01:35:51,686 --> 01:35:53,651
and the  Order.

1115
01:35:55,277 --> 01:35:56,746
I see.

1116
01:35:58,151 --> 01:36:01,061
Well, at least that solves the great mystery 
as to how you became an inspector.

1117
01:36:06,188 --> 01:36:07,559
Excuse me, my lord,

1118
01:36:08,622 --> 01:36:11,166
But I've been wanting to 
do that for a long time.

1119
01:36:11,563 --> 01:36:14,598
Well, Inspector, I have five minutes
before my next engagement.

1120
01:36:15,543 --> 01:36:18,574
So why don't you regale me
with your stories of conspiracy.

1121
01:36:21,888 --> 01:36:23,357
Thanks you, Lestrade.

1122
01:36:24,130 --> 01:36:25,404
My lord.

1123
01:36:31,421 --> 01:36:34,358
I'm curious, Coward. Did you assist
Blackwood in all the murders...

1124
01:36:34,704 --> 01:36:36,767
or just the one I prevented?

1125
01:36:37,942 --> 01:36:40,082
Very distinctive those 
handmade shoes of yours.

1126
01:36:42,895 --> 01:36:46,395
But the price of quality is often
the unique imprint they leave.

1127
01:36:48,360 --> 01:36:51,458
Nonetheless, I confess to being 
completely outmatched.

1128
01:36:52,533 --> 01:36:54,918
I could deduce very little 
from my investigation.

1129
01:36:56,550 --> 01:36:59,357
Fortunately there is nothing 
more stimulating than a case

1130
01:36:59,357 --> 01:37:00,645
where everything goes against you.

1131
01:37:01,885 --> 01:37:04,354
How many members of Parliament
ido you intend to murder at noon today?

1132
01:37:05,648 --> 01:37:09,575
Man, ox, eagle, lion.
Lion is the Parliament, tisn't it?

1133
01:37:12,619 --> 01:37:14,011
Very clever.

1134
01:37:14,961 --> 01:37:16,870
But it's not murder,
Mr. Holmes.

1135
01:37:17,556 --> 01:37:19,118
It's mercy.

1136
01:37:19,486 --> 01:37:21,837
We are giving the weak masses
a strong shepherd.

1137
01:37:22,370 --> 01:37:24,077
Don't you see that it's for their own...

1138
01:37:27,775 --> 01:37:30,336
No, but I don't care much what you think.

1139
01:37:30,554 --> 01:37:33,455
I jsimply wanted to know the location
of Blackwood's final ceremony.

1140
01:37:33,455 --> 01:37:35,043
And now you've given it to me.

1141
01:37:35,043 --> 01:37:36,681
I've told you nothing.

1142
01:37:36,681 --> 01:37:39,559
But your clothes say infinitely more
than you could ever hope.

1143
01:37:40,249 --> 01:37:43,091
The mud smeared on your boots 
from where you've been walking.

1144
01:37:43,597 --> 01:37:46,768
A touch of red brick dust on your knee
from where you've been kneeling.

1145
01:37:48,083 --> 01:37:51,093
A small bandage on your thumb
from where you have been vowing.

1146
01:37:51,498 --> 01:37:54,703
A faint aroma of excrement 
from where you've been standing.

1147
01:37:57,833 --> 01:38:01,178
You and Blackwood laid the final
touches to your ceremony in the sewers.

1148
01:38:01,178 --> 01:38:02,405
beneath Parliament

1149
01:38:02,656 --> 01:38:04,001
less than an hour ago.

1150
01:38:04,921 --> 01:38:06,550
Both houses meet today.

1151
01:38:07,345 --> 01:38:09,304
The whole government would be present.

1152
01:38:19,067 --> 01:38:21,537
It's a shame you made an 
enemy of Blackwood, Holmes.

1153
01:38:22,815 --> 01:38:24,473
You would have made a valuable ally.

1154
01:38:32,194 --> 01:38:33,974
How terrible is wisdom

1155
01:38:34,213 --> 01:38:36,476
when it brings no profit to the wise?

1156
01:38:38,464 --> 01:38:40,240
We take power at noon.

1157
01:38:40,240 --> 01:38:42,000
There isn't any time to 
waste then ...

1158
01:38:42,225 --> 01:38:44,069
is there?

1159
01:39:09,698 --> 01:39:12,357
I told you you he'd be coming out the 
top window, soldier boy. There isn't any way

1160
01:39:12,576 --> 01:39:14,181
he'd be coming out of that terrace.

1161
01:39:14,423 --> 01:39:17,263
Technically, that isn't the 
top window, is it, sailor boy?

1162
01:39:17,827 --> 01:39:20,111
- What is it?
- Well, it's the middle window.

1163
01:39:20,318 --> 01:39:24,795
Anyway!
You will be pleased to know Lestrade 
performed his role perfectly.

1164
01:39:25,610 --> 01:39:27,223
I think he rather enjoyed it.

1165
01:39:27,435 --> 01:39:29,193
I hope you know what 
you're doing, Holmes.

1166
01:39:29,664 --> 01:39:31,098
Here's the key.

1167
01:39:31,486 --> 01:39:33,069
You got all you needed from Coward?

1168
01:39:33,069 --> 01:39:35,052
Yes, I smoked him out
with relative ease.

1169
01:39:36,426 --> 01:39:37,704
- Taylor?
- Yes?

1170
01:39:37,704 --> 01:39:40,476
If you would, Captain, take us
under the bridge, port side,

1171
01:39:40,476 --> 01:39:44,288
approximately 100 yards, beyond that you will find
the tunnel that leads us to the sewers.

1172
01:39:45,333 --> 01:39:46,477
Right away, sir.
1196a
01:39:54,100 --> 01:39:55,000
The end is nigh.

1173
01:39:55,944 --> 01:39:59,604
Blackwood's come back from hell
and laid a curse upon this land.

1174
01:40:47,105 --> 01:40:49,303
Behold. Blackwood's magic revealed.

1175
01:40:49,835 --> 01:40:50,896
What does it do?

1176
01:40:50,896 --> 01:40:52,241
It is a chemical weapon.

1177
01:40:52,711 --> 01:40:53,850
First of its kind.

1178
01:40:54,053 --> 01:40:55,046
You deduced that how?

1179
01:40:56,012 --> 01:40:57,116
From my pocket.

1180
01:40:57,948 --> 01:41:00,511
I slipped this over rather a cumbersome
rat at the slaughterhouse.

1181
01:41:01,103 --> 01:41:02,386
Notice the blue discoloration.

1182
01:41:02,586 --> 01:41:06,336
The faintest smell of  bitter almonds,
telltale traces of cyanide.

1183
01:41:11,483 --> 01:41:14,330
Now we know what the ginger midget was working on.
It will revolutionize warfare.

1184
01:41:15,294 --> 01:41:16,112
Yes, killing a lot of people.

1185
01:41:17,714 --> 01:41:19,369
It's now 7 minutes to noon. 
What are we going to do?

1186
01:41:22,527 --> 01:41:24,217
Well when ...

1187
01:41:27,016 --> 01:41:28,922
...for a muse

1188
01:42:03,825 --> 01:42:05,220
Shoot him! 
Now, please!

1189
01:42:22,195 --> 01:42:25,821
The time has come.
Where only those who believe can remain.

1190
01:42:27,915 --> 01:42:30,354
Behold ... Lord Blackwood.

1191
01:42:45,011 --> 01:42:46,444
You seem surprised.

1192
01:42:48,425 --> 01:42:51,922
I have returned from beyond the grave
to fulfill England's destiny.

1193
01:42:53,341 --> 01:42:55,898
and extend the boundaries
of this great empire.

1194
01:42:59,315 --> 01:43:01,616
Listen to the rabble outside.

1195
01:43:02,193 --> 01:43:03,555
Listen ...

1196
01:43:03,956 --> 01:43:05,333
to the fear.

1197
01:43:05,721 --> 01:43:08,282
I will use that as a weapon
to control them ...

1198
01:43:09,927 --> 01:43:11,410
and then the world.

1199
01:43:15,691 --> 01:43:17,815
I've never seen anything like it.
Look at this.

1200
01:43:21,744 --> 01:43:24,057
It's specifically designed to
prevent us from disarming it.

1201
01:43:27,245 --> 01:43:29,976
These components appear to be designed 
to receive a signal of some sort.

1202
01:43:29,976 --> 01:43:31,804
Electromagnetic waves?

1203
01:43:32,058 --> 01:43:34,164
When triggered the
electrodes will send a charge

1204
01:43:34,403 --> 01:43:36,086
converting the chemical into gas

1205
01:43:36,289 --> 01:43:38,100
the gas will travel up that shaft

1206
01:43:38,100 --> 01:43:41,259
and filter through the ventilation 
system that leads directly to Parliament.

1207
01:43:41,662 --> 01:43:45,886
Within seconds of its administration, the 
most powerful men in the world will
be choking on death.

1208
01:43:47,811 --> 01:43:49,125
Blackwood must have some kind of transmitter

1209
01:43:49,125 --> 01:43:50,435
that connects  with it remotely.

1210
01:43:50,435 --> 01:43:51,942
Three minutes, ten seconds.

1211
01:43:51,942 --> 01:43:56,102
I will create an empire
that will endure for millennia.

1212
01:43:56,704 --> 01:43:58,953
Indestructible
...and eternal.

1213
01:44:00,616 --> 01:44:02,835
Move it!

1214
01:44:03,835 --> 01:44:08,262
We don't actually have to disarm
the device. We just have to
remove the cylinders.

1215
01:44:09,011 --> 01:44:10,138
Yes.

1216
01:44:10,138 --> 01:44:14,867
Except that they're welded in.
What we need is a controlled explosion.

1217
01:44:16,377 --> 01:44:19,818
We need a container to direct the blast,
like clay pipe. Should serve as that ambition.

1218
01:44:40,461 --> 01:44:42,000
Rather wish you hadn't done that, Irene.

1219
01:44:48,730 --> 01:44:52,657
On the twelfth chime,
I will summon the dark powers.

1220
01:44:54,528 --> 01:44:57,636
All those who are with me
shall be protected.

1221
01:44:58,823 --> 01:45:01,404
All others will perish.

1222
01:45:08,990 --> 01:45:10,499
I need your pipe.

1223
01:45:13,855 --> 01:45:15,514
Nut him!

1224
01:46:22,552 --> 01:46:26,010
A new order ... begins now.

1225
01:46:34,334 --> 01:46:35,614
What are you waiting for?

1226
01:46:38,490 --> 01:46:39,678
That.

1227
01:46:51,775 --> 01:46:54,136
Apprehend Coward!

1228
01:46:56,202 --> 01:46:58,580
- Can you manage?
- Of course I can.

1229
01:47:24,612 --> 01:47:26,862
Relax.
I'm a doctor.

1230
01:48:39,142 --> 01:48:40,930
Did you take a wrong turning somewhere?

1231
01:48:43,407 --> 01:48:44,863
We're safe now.

1232
01:48:45,800 --> 01:48:47,223
Interesting assessment.

1233
01:48:49,558 --> 01:48:50,988
Run off.

1234
01:48:54,051 --> 01:48:55,710
I won't be chasing you anymore.

1235
01:48:57,328 --> 01:48:58,782
Fare thee well.

1236
01:49:03,781 --> 01:49:05,220
I don't want to run anymore.

1237
01:49:08,678 --> 01:49:10,459
I'll tell you everything.

1238
01:49:10,866 --> 01:49:12,022
I wish you would.

1239
01:49:35,223 --> 01:49:36,260
No!

1240
01:50:42,736 --> 01:50:44,364
There was never any magic.

1241
01:50:46,268 --> 01:50:48,128
Only conjuring tricks.

1242
01:50:52,407 --> 01:50:54,124
The simplest involve paying people off.

1243
01:50:54,673 --> 01:50:57,454
Like the prison guard who pretended to
be obsessed outside your cell.

1244
01:50:58,140 --> 01:51:00,358
Your reputation and the 
inmates' fear did the rest.

1245
01:51:01,993 --> 01:51:04,322
Others required more 
elaborate preparations.

1246
01:51:04,633 --> 01:51:07,228
Like the sandstone slab 
that covered your tomb.

1247
01:51:09,590 --> 01:51:10,529
You had it broken before your burial and then

1248
01:51:10,529 --> 01:51:12,997
put back together with a mild adhesive.

1249
01:51:14,315 --> 01:51:16,095
An ancient Egyptian recipe, I believe.

1250
01:51:16,825 --> 01:51:21,547
A mixture of egg and honey,
besides, it'd be washed away by the rain.

1251
01:51:26,255 --> 01:51:28,344
Holmes!

1252
01:51:28,596 --> 01:51:31,204
Arranging for your father
to drown in his own bathtub

1253
01:51:31,408 --> 01:51:33,157
required more modern science.

1254
01:51:33,157 --> 01:51:35,821
Very clever of Reordan to find a paralytic

1255
01:51:36,031 --> 01:51:39,081
that was activated by the 
combination of copper and water.

1256
01:51:39,081 --> 01:51:42,867
and was therefore undetectable
once the bath water was drained.

1257
01:51:44,526 --> 01:51:45,793
It would have been quite a 
challenge for me had he

1258
01:51:45,793 --> 01:51:49,795
not also tested it on some 
unfortunate amphibian.

1259
01:51:54,315 --> 01:51:56,699
The death of Standish
was a real mystery

1260
01:51:56,699 --> 01:52:00,829
until you used the same compound
to blow up the wharf.

1261
01:52:01,138 --> 01:52:04,752
An odorless, tasteless, flammable liquid

1262
01:52:04,752 --> 01:52:07,514
gives it a burn with an unusual pink issue.

1263
01:52:09,031 --> 01:52:11,265
Did Standish mistake it for rain
as he entered the temple?

1264
01:52:11,265 --> 01:52:15,268
All it took was a spark.

1265
01:52:19,644 --> 01:52:21,549
A simple rigged bullet in his gun.

1266
01:52:23,400 --> 01:52:24,673
Ingenious.

1267
01:52:24,673 --> 01:52:27,652
Like all great performers, 
you saved your pièce de résistance
for the end

1268
01:52:28,222 --> 01:52:31,340
A chemical weapon 
distilled from cyanide

1269
01:52:31,340 --> 01:52:33,173
and refined in the bellies of swine.

1270
01:52:33,580 --> 01:52:36,550
Had it worked, your followers
in Parliament would have 

1271
01:52:36,800 --> 01:52:39,970
watched unharmed as their colleagues 
wre dying around them.

1272
01:52:40,796 --> 01:52:42,656
They didn't know you had 
given them the antidote.

1273
01:52:42,900 --> 01:52:44,467
Instead they would have believed

1274
01:52:44,980 --> 01:52:47,400
and that you'd harnessed the ultimate power.

1275
01:52:47,550 --> 01:52:52,800
And the world would have followed.
Fear being the most 
powerful weapon of all.

1276
01:52:53,600 --> 01:52:56,800
You'd better hope that it's
it's nothing more than superstition

1277
01:52:57,220 --> 01:52:59,800
and that you performed all the rituals perfectly.

1278
01:53:00,504 --> 01:53:02,533
The devil's due a soul, I'd say.

1279
01:53:04,472 --> 01:53:07,315
By God's sake, Holmes
Cut me loose!

1280
01:53:17,769 --> 01:53:20,349
First,
the world will see you for what you are.

1281
01:53:20,724 --> 01:53:22,340
A fraud.

1282
01:53:22,709 --> 01:53:25,523
Then you will be hanged...
properly this time.

1283
01:53:25,887 --> 01:53:28,321
It's a long journey from here to the rope.

1284
01:54:19,891 --> 01:54:22,328
I've never woken up in handcuffs before.

1285
01:54:23,506 --> 01:54:24,940
I have.

1286
01:54:26,355 --> 01:54:27,838
Naked.

1287
01:54:32,040 --> 01:54:33,620
A storm is coming.

1288
01:54:34,525 --> 01:54:36,915
Well ... we've still got a moment.

1289
01:54:41,856 --> 01:54:44,025
- Moriarty ...
- What?

1290
01:54:45,182 --> 01:54:46,828
That's his name.

1291
01:54:47,563 --> 01:54:49,180
And he is a professor.

1292
01:54:51,526 --> 01:54:53,370
Everyone has a weak spot.

1293
01:54:54,391 --> 01:54:56,212
And he found mine.

1294
01:54:57,962 --> 01:54:59,862
Where was it, precisely?

1295
01:55:10,796 --> 01:55:12,608
Please don't underestimate him.

1296
01:55:14,130 --> 01:55:15,955
He's just as brilliant as you are.

1297
01:55:16,829 --> 01:55:18,816
and infinitely more indevious.

1298
01:55:21,241 --> 01:55:22,779
We'll see about that.

1299
01:55:37,862 --> 01:55:40,270
You'll miss me, Sherlock.

1300
01:55:42,191 --> 01:55:45,167
Sadly... yes.

1301
01:56:13,527 --> 01:56:17,298
- Afternoon, sir. I put the 
  notebooks in this one, sir.
- Thank you.

1302
01:56:17,298 --> 01:56:18,650
What's in these, John?

1303
01:56:18,954 --> 01:56:20,718
- Scribbles.
- Scribbles?

1304
01:56:21,105 --> 01:56:22,778
- Notes.
- They're your adventures?

1305
01:56:23,247 --> 01:56:24,499
I'd like to read them.

1306
01:56:31,644 --> 01:56:32,717
Hold on. What's wrong?

1307
01:56:32,717 --> 01:56:35,062
Think he's finally come to terms with you leaving?

1308
01:56:35,406 --> 01:56:37,938
Mary, look at the ring he's given us.

1309
01:56:39,281 --> 01:56:41,114
Now, five minutes here, and we'll go home.

1310
01:56:41,780 --> 01:56:42,845
Our home.

1311
01:56:43,503 --> 01:56:44,749
Get up those stairs.

1312
01:56:53,130 --> 01:56:54,596
Don't worry, dear.

1313
01:56:55,252 --> 01:56:58,671
Suicide is not in his repertoire.
He's far too fond of himself for that.

1314
01:56:59,443 --> 01:57:00,766
Holmes!

1315
01:57:03,289 --> 01:57:05,672
Oh! 
Good afternoon.

1316
01:57:05,930 --> 01:57:09,225
I was trying to deduce the manner in which
Blackwood survived his execution.

1317
01:57:09,643 --> 01:57:11,196
Clearing our good names as well.

1318
01:57:12,080 --> 01:57:14,583
But it had a surprising supporous effect on me,

1319
01:57:14,583 --> 01:57:16,486
and I was carried off in the arms of Morpheus.

1320
01:57:16,954 --> 01:57:19,479
Like a caterpillar in a cocoon.
Good afternoon, dear.

1321
01:57:20,134 --> 01:57:21,520
Get on with it, Holmes.

1322
01:57:22,350 --> 01:57:24,603
Cleverly concealed in the hangman's knot was a hook.

1323
01:57:25,835 --> 01:57:28,803
Oh dear, I think my legs have fallen asleep.
I should probably come down.

1324
01:57:29,166 --> 01:57:30,730
John, shouldn't we help him down?

1325
01:57:30,730 --> 01:57:33,569
No, no, no, I hate to cut him off midstream.

1326
01:57:33,569 --> 01:57:34,864
Carry on.

1327
01:57:35,732 --> 01:57:38,834
Uh, look, the executioner attached it to a harness

1328
01:57:38,834 --> 01:57:41,492
thus allowing the weight to be distributed
around the waist
and the neck ...

1329
01:57:41,892 --> 01:57:43,294
to remain intact.

1330
01:57:43,637 --> 01:57:45,241
Oh, my lord, I can't feel my cheeks.

1331
01:57:45,241 --> 01:57:47,226
Might we continue this at ground level?

1332
01:57:47,461 --> 01:57:49,057
How did you manage it, Holmes?

1333
01:57:49,414 --> 01:57:52,713
I have managed it with braces, belts,
and a coat hook.

1334
01:57:53,585 --> 01:57:56,297
Please, Watson, my tongue is growing 
cold and I'll be no use to you at all.

1335
01:57:56,869 --> 01:57:58,465
- Worse things have happened.
- John.

1336
01:58:01,838 --> 01:58:03,713
None of this explains

1337
01:58:03,713 --> 01:58:05,236
Blackwood's lack of pulse.

1338
01:58:06,310 --> 01:58:09,029
Now, the medical mystery.

1339
01:58:09,029 --> 01:58:10,831
We must restore your reputation,
Watson.

1340
01:58:11,456 --> 01:58:15,092
There is a toxin refined from the
nectar of the rhododendron ponticum.

1341
01:58:15,497 --> 01:58:18,687
It is quite infamous in the region of Turkey
bordering the Black Sea

1342
01:58:18,687 --> 01:58:21,219
for its ability to induce an
apparently mortal paralysis.

1343
01:58:21,592 --> 01:58:25,328
Enough to mislead a medical mind even as
well-trained and tenacious as your own.

1344
01:58:25,782 --> 01:58:27,564
It's known locally as ...

1345
01:58:27,564 --> 01:58:29,016
What's wrong with Gladstone?

1346
01:58:29,234 --> 01:58:30,657
Mad honey disease..

1347
01:58:30,657 --> 01:58:33,304
He's demonstrating the very 
effect I've just described.

1348
01:58:34,554 --> 01:58:36,033
He's all right.

1349
01:58:38,643 --> 01:58:40,932
Mary, don't worry. He's seen far worse.

1350
01:58:41,867 --> 01:58:43,251
Mr. Holmes?

1351
01:58:45,128 --> 01:58:46,395
Doctor, Miss Mary ...

1352
01:58:47,131 --> 01:58:49,253
Sir, Inspector Lestrade asks that you 
come with me right away.

1353
01:58:50,838 --> 01:58:52,333
What is it this time, Clarky?

1354
01:58:52,557 --> 01:58:54,661
It's one of our sergeants, sir.

1355
01:58:54,661 --> 01:58:56,649
He went missing in the sewers
the day you stopped Lord Blackwood. 

1356
01:58:56,649 --> 01:59:00,053
I'm afraid sewage workers found
his body just this morning, sir.

1357
01:59:01,287 --> 01:59:03,883
We believe the sergeant
was the first man on the scene.

1358
01:59:04,849 --> 01:59:06,413
Can I help you, officer?

1359
01:59:07,007 --> 01:59:08,477
... shot in the head.

1360
01:59:10,120 --> 01:59:11,665
Was it a small caliber bullet?

1361
01:59:12,953 --> 01:59:14,152
Yes.

1362
01:59:15,496 --> 01:59:17,215
Were there powder burns on his eyebrows?

1363
01:59:17,682 --> 01:59:18,964
Indeed, sir.

1364
01:59:21,580 --> 01:59:22,931
Point blank range.

1365
01:59:23,372 --> 01:59:24,963
Moriarty.

1366
01:59:25,746 --> 01:59:27,455
Professor Moriarty.

1367
01:59:30,728 --> 01:59:32,225
There's a good boy!

1368
01:59:32,608 --> 01:59:33,955
Everything's going to be fine.

1369
01:59:35,507 --> 01:59:37,016
Where is Blackwood's device now?

1370
01:59:37,016 --> 01:59:38,706
Secret Service have it sir, sir.

1371
01:59:38,706 --> 01:59:40,208
They've taken over the case.

1372
01:59:40,613 --> 01:59:42,017
I'd wager there's a piece missing.

1373
01:59:44,945 --> 01:59:47,596
So Moriarty was after a piece of the machine.

1374
01:59:48,351 --> 01:59:49,527
Not the poison.

1375
01:59:49,527 --> 01:59:51,710
There's nothing more elusive
than an obvious fact.

1376
01:59:52,231 --> 01:59:54,550
Access to the invention
was the goal all along.

1377
01:59:55,160 --> 01:59:56,927
And Adler was just a diversion.

1378
01:59:57,302 --> 01:59:58,617
He knew I'd chase after her

1379
01:59:58,617 --> 02:00:00,461
thereby leaving the machine accessible.

1380
02:00:00,863 --> 02:00:03,881
The technology of that kind would
be worth an untold fortune.

1381
02:00:04,804 --> 02:00:09,491
Imagine being able to control any device
by sending a command by radio waves.

1382
02:00:10,920 --> 02:00:12,586
It's the future, Watson.

1383
02:00:15,990 --> 02:00:17,904
I've loaded the last of your boxes, sir.

1384
02:00:21,664 --> 02:00:23,135
- Well ...
- What?

1385
02:00:24,307 --> 02:00:25,507
Gladstone!

1386
02:00:25,507 --> 02:00:26,978
Stop him before he gets to the front door.

1387
02:00:28,040 --> 02:00:29,509
Clarky?

1388
02:00:31,634 --> 02:00:33,220
The case is reopened.
