1
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:44,753
Do you remember the story
of a girl who lived a life of cinders,

2
00:00:44,837 --> 00:00:46,671
and how she found true love

3
00:00:46,756 --> 00:00:49,633
because she kept a beautiful dream
in her heart?

4
00:00:50,718 --> 00:00:53,803
Of course it helped that she had
mouse friends who could sew

5
00:00:53,888 --> 00:00:57,057
and a Fairy Godmother
who could do wonders with pumpkins.

6
00:00:57,141 --> 00:01:00,560
Well, that girl is me.

7
00:01:06,776 --> 00:01:10,737
What a perfectly perfect life
lt's a fairy tale come true

8
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:14,574
l'm a princess and a wife
all because l fit a shoe

9
00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:19,204
When l dreamed of love
who'd have guessed l'd end up here

10
00:01:19,288 --> 00:01:22,499
At the end of a perfectly perfect year

11
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:24,125
Would my perfectly perfect wife

12
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:26,086
put on her perfectly fitting shoes?

13
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:27,837
You found my shoes.

14
00:01:29,507 --> 00:01:31,841
Better hurry. Fairy Godmother's waiting.

15
00:01:31,926 --> 00:01:34,302
What were the mice
using them for this time?

16
00:01:34,387 --> 00:01:35,553
Boats.

17
00:01:35,638 --> 00:01:36,638
There.

18
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:45,855
Oh, what a wonderfully
perfectly perfect year!

19
00:01:49,944 --> 00:01:51,945
Why should we have to do the chores?

20
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:53,822
l would rather rot in jail

21
00:01:53,906 --> 00:01:55,865
Washing dishes and scrubbing floors

22
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,701
That's just great
l broke a nail

23
00:01:57,785 --> 00:02:01,454
Cinderella is in the palace
living a life of luxury

24
00:02:01,539 --> 00:02:04,374
And we've not once
been invited to a ball

25
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:07,002
-Or even tea
-Why don't l get a happy ending?

26
00:02:07,086 --> 00:02:09,879
Where's the prince who'll marry me?

27
00:02:09,964 --> 00:02:14,759
When will this horrible
nightmare disappear?

28
00:02:15,261 --> 00:02:16,970
Pathetic.

29
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:22,559
Oh, what a perfectly
miserably awful year

30
00:02:24,145 --> 00:02:25,729
Give me your hand.

31
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:38,450
Somewhere there must be

32
00:02:38,534 --> 00:02:40,577
Someone who'll love me

33
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:44,664
And show me a world that l never knew

34
00:02:44,749 --> 00:02:46,499
He'll ask for my hand

35
00:02:46,584 --> 00:02:48,710
And l'll say "l do"

36
00:02:48,794 --> 00:02:52,505
Oh, wouldn't it be finer than fine

37
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:56,426
lf that perfectly perfect love

38
00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:00,764
Were mine

39
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:08,563
He's a perfectly charming prince

40
00:03:08,647 --> 00:03:10,523
She's a charmingly perfect lass

41
00:03:10,608 --> 00:03:13,693
They've lived happily ever
since she fit the slipper

42
00:03:13,778 --> 00:03:15,403
Made of glass

43
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:18,073
Take your places everyone

44
00:03:18,157 --> 00:03:22,285
The time is drawing near to celebrate

45
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:25,538
A perfectly perfect year

46
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:28,291
Surprise!

47
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:36,966
A perfect anniversary party

48
00:03:37,051 --> 00:03:38,718
That we planned for you

49
00:03:38,803 --> 00:03:40,136
And l threw in some magic

50
00:03:40,221 --> 00:03:42,514
With a bibbidi-bobbidi-boo

51
00:03:42,598 --> 00:03:46,434
Just like the night l sent you to the ball

52
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:50,105
So that's how Cinderella did it. Magic.

53
00:03:50,189 --> 00:03:53,691
On this perfectly perfect day
there is magic in the air

54
00:03:53,776 --> 00:03:57,570
Gee, l wonder if that old lady
has a wand that she could spare

55
00:03:57,655 --> 00:03:59,781
What could ever come between us?

56
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:02,117
l would gladly volunteer

57
00:04:02,201 --> 00:04:04,244
And as for the future

58
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:06,079
Well, it's perfectly clear

59
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:10,667
-lt's sure to be another magically
-Tragically

60
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:16,214
Perfectly perfect year

61
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:17,298
Perfect!

62
00:04:24,056 --> 00:04:26,474
Mother! Mother!

63
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:28,226
Mother!

64
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,353
Anastasia, where have you been?

65
00:04:30,438 --> 00:04:34,399
-Slacking off again.
-Mother, our troubles are over!

66
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:37,569
A stick?

67
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:39,446
Let's beat her with it.

68
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:41,489
No, no, no, no. Not a stick.

69
00:04:41,574 --> 00:04:43,825
A magic wand.

70
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:46,202
Well, she finally cracked.

71
00:04:46,287 --> 00:04:48,037
I saw this nutty old woman and zap!

72
00:04:48,122 --> 00:04:52,917
She gave Cinderella the beautiful gown
and, oh, the Prince.

73
00:04:53,002 --> 00:04:56,796
-I blame the housework.
-I'll prove it to you.

74
00:04:56,881 --> 00:05:00,675
What were those words again?
Wappity-pappity-poo?

75
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:03,553
Skip-skip-scadoo? No, I know it.
I know it. I think.

76
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:07,223
Oh, no, I've got it. I've got it.
Bibbidi-bobbidi...

77
00:05:07,308 --> 00:05:08,766
There it is!

78
00:05:08,851 --> 00:05:10,894
Child, put that down!

79
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:15,231
In the wrong hands that wand
could be extremely dangerous.

80
00:05:15,316 --> 00:05:18,485
Now, now give it back to me
you silly little goose.

81
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:21,738
No way, Grandma. Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!

82
00:05:36,295 --> 00:05:38,046
Look what you've done.

83
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:40,173
Now give me back my wand.

84
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:43,092
No, I need it,
you silly old garden gnome!

85
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:44,844
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!

86
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:59,108
Hello? Hello... Hello, Grandma?

87
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:04,656
I... I'm sorry.
Oh, I didn't mean to hurt you.

88
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:09,202
So this is how Cinderella did it.
What delicious irony.

89
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:11,955
Do you realise what this means, girls?

90
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:14,624
Yes! No more laundry!

91
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:21,339
It means power, riches,

92
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:23,341
revenge.

93
00:06:27,263 --> 00:06:29,430
I wanna be dirty, filthy, stinking rich!

94
00:06:29,515 --> 00:06:31,516
I want a prince of my own!

95
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,101
Please, please, please.

96
00:06:33,185 --> 00:06:35,019
-Give it to me!
-No, give it to me!

97
00:06:35,104 --> 00:06:36,813
Girls! Girls!

98
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:39,774
First things first.

99
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:42,235
Now, Cinderella,

100
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,947
to undo your trickery
and take what's rightfully ours,

101
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:49,701
I call upon all the forces of the universe!

102
00:06:49,785 --> 00:06:52,662
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!

103
00:07:10,848 --> 00:07:15,518
Reverse the moon and sun,
turn back tide and time,

104
00:07:15,603 --> 00:07:19,105
unravel Cinderella's happily ever after

105
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:22,567
to the moment my troubles began!

106
00:07:56,727 --> 00:07:58,394
Stop!

107
00:08:03,192 --> 00:08:05,443
-Wow.
-Wow.

108
00:08:10,074 --> 00:08:11,616
The Grand Duke!

109
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:14,952
It worked.

110
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:19,499
Magnificent!
And no one knows except us.

111
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:23,503
Get ready. This is your second chance.
Don't waste it.

112
00:08:23,587 --> 00:08:24,796
Where's Cinderella?

113
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,590
She's exactly where she was
the first time.

114
00:08:27,675 --> 00:08:29,258
Cinderelly!

115
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,347
The Grand Duke!

116
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:35,682
Your Excellence.

117
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:36,974
Your Grace.

118
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:39,602
His Grace will now read the royal...

119
00:08:39,687 --> 00:08:42,563
Pardon me, but we're all aware
of His Grace's purpose.

120
00:08:42,648 --> 00:08:45,024
Perhaps we should just get on with it.

121
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:49,112
Quite, madam. Quite.

122
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:08,923
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.

123
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:15,596
It fits!

124
00:09:15,681 --> 00:09:16,973
It fits?

125
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:19,225
It fits!

126
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:22,520
Mother, it fits.

127
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:24,814
Gee. I wonder if it fits.

128
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:27,316
It fits, it fits! Oh, Mother!

129
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:29,402
I'm gonna get my prince!

130
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:34,615
Grace and poise, my dear!

131
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:40,580
I hereby declare

132
00:09:40,664 --> 00:09:45,084
that we have found
the Prince's bride-to-be.

133
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:50,757
We must return to the palace at once!

134
00:09:53,302 --> 00:09:54,677
No. It can't be.

135
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:57,305
Would Your Grace excuse me?

136
00:09:57,389 --> 00:10:00,683
I must have a word with my maid.

137
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:08,649
You look confused, dear.

138
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:11,736
How could the slipper
have fit Anastasia?

139
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,530
I danced with the Prince.
That was my slipper.

140
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:18,075
Here, I have the other one.
I'm the one he's looking for.

141
00:10:18,202 --> 00:10:21,954
You may have danced with him.
You may even have thought it was love.

142
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:26,959
But the slipper fits Anastasia,
and that's who he's marrying.

143
00:10:27,044 --> 00:10:30,880
Whatever you think happened
last night was a dream.

144
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:40,556
I don't care where you go
or what you do,

145
00:10:40,641 --> 00:10:43,142
but you stay away from the palace.

146
00:10:43,227 --> 00:10:46,312
Stay away from the Prince.

147
00:10:50,234 --> 00:10:53,820
And clean up that broken glass.

148
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:21,138
What just a-happened?

149
00:11:22,266 --> 00:11:25,518
I... I don't understand.

150
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:27,895
I've...

151
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:31,315
l've always dreamed

152
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,110
That my life could be

153
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:36,362
Like a fairy tale

154
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:39,532
A perfect fantasy

155
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:41,617
Every day a new adventure

156
00:11:42,286 --> 00:11:44,996
On some undiscovered shore

157
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,123
Was it nothing more

158
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:48,624
Than a dream?

159
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:52,295
Then one magic night

160
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:55,381
With a single dance

161
00:11:55,465 --> 00:12:00,720
l found more than
just a storybook romance

162
00:12:00,804 --> 00:12:03,306
And for once my life was perfect

163
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,933
As we glided 'cross the floor

164
00:12:06,018 --> 00:12:08,895
And it was so much more

165
00:12:08,979 --> 00:12:14,066
So much more than a dream

166
00:12:14,151 --> 00:12:16,736
l could say it never happened

167
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,821
Just a dream from the start

168
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:21,657
But then l'd live my life

169
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:24,201
With a broken heart

170
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:26,662
No, no. No cry, Gus-Gus.

171
00:12:26,747 --> 00:12:29,040
Princey knows he danced
with Cinderelly.

172
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:33,377
Yes, of course he does.

173
00:12:33,462 --> 00:12:35,922
If I just see him again...

174
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:38,049
Yeah, yeah, see Princey!

175
00:12:38,133 --> 00:12:40,593
Yes. Everything will be all right.

176
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:44,513
-Everything will be all right.
-Duh... Yeah, yeah!

177
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:50,144
'Cause in a prince's arms
l've found a love l can't deny

178
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:52,855
lf there's any chance to set things right

179
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:56,859
l've simply got to try

180
00:12:56,944 --> 00:12:59,695
So l'll trust my heart

181
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:02,073
What else can l do?

182
00:13:02,157 --> 00:13:04,659
l can't live in dreams

183
00:13:04,743 --> 00:13:07,370
lf my dreams are to come true

184
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:09,664
There's a better life that's waiting

185
00:13:09,748 --> 00:13:12,416
Past the mountains l must climb

186
00:13:12,501 --> 00:13:18,381
l will take a chance on love
to get my once upon a time

187
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:26,138
Oh, I want so much more

188
00:13:26,223 --> 00:13:29,392
So much more

189
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:35,982
Than a dream

190
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:49,829
Cinderelly, big blue guards.

191
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:54,542
Gus-Gus handle 'em.
Let me at 'em! Let me at 'em!

192
00:13:57,087 --> 00:13:59,505
Let's try the servant's entrance first.

193
00:14:03,802 --> 00:14:06,429
-Good morning, sir.
-Good morning.

194
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:08,139
-Onions for the King.
-Well done.

195
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:09,348
Strawberries, sir.

196
00:14:10,434 --> 00:14:11,684
Keep out of sight.

197
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:14,979
The King is waiting. There you are.

198
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:18,941
-The King will enjoy them.
-They're his favourite.

199
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:47,470
Now, all we have to do is find him
and everything will be...

200
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:49,013
Stop! You there.

201
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:52,183
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

202
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:53,476
I...

203
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,895
I'm in charge of all the servants
in this castle,

204
00:14:55,979 --> 00:14:58,147
and I've never seen you before.

205
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:00,900
What is your purpose?

206
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:04,820
My purpose. Well... I... I...

207
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:08,365
I'm the royal mouse catcher.

208
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:13,204
Royal mouse catcher? Preposterous.

209
00:15:13,288 --> 00:15:15,414
Snap 'em and trap 'em.
That's my motto.

210
00:15:15,499 --> 00:15:16,707
Oh, no!

211
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:18,709
In the 30 years

212
00:15:18,794 --> 00:15:20,503
that I have supervised

213
00:15:22,506 --> 00:15:23,589
this castle,

214
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:28,010
I can assure you there has never
ever been a single, solitary...

215
00:15:28,095 --> 00:15:29,512
Mouse!

216
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:32,640
-Where is it?
-Mice!

217
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:41,023
Oh, please, let me help.

218
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:44,860
This is my kitchen. I'll take care of it!

219
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:47,530
Take that!

220
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:49,448
And that! Vile vermin!

221
00:15:49,533 --> 00:15:50,950
Please, I can handle this!

222
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:52,535
Not now!

223
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:54,036
I've got them on the run!

224
00:15:55,247 --> 00:15:56,705
Really, I can help.

225
00:16:03,505 --> 00:16:06,257
There he is! I got him! I got him!

226
00:16:09,219 --> 00:16:12,304
So then, I'll just go get those mice.

227
00:16:20,105 --> 00:16:21,981
Come on, guys.

228
00:16:22,274 --> 00:16:23,816
Nice work.

229
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,277
If we split up,
we'll find the Prince faster.

230
00:16:26,361 --> 00:16:27,820
Split up! Righty-o!

231
00:16:28,405 --> 00:16:31,157
-But, Dad...
-Those aren't reasons!

232
00:16:32,576 --> 00:16:34,785
Breeding, refinement!

233
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:37,163
These are the reasons
to marry someone.

234
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:40,332
Not their choice in transparent footwear!

235
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,171
Nice parry.

236
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:46,255
Thanks.

237
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:51,594
It's not about the slipper.
It's the girl in the slipper.

238
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:55,681
She was... Well, she was...

239
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:58,058
She was what?

240
00:16:58,143 --> 00:17:01,395
Well, she was the one.

241
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:03,105
I know it.

242
00:17:06,902 --> 00:17:09,278
You think there's only
one woman in the kingdom

243
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:11,447
who wears a size four and a half?

244
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:13,324
It's all I have to go on here.

245
00:17:13,408 --> 00:17:15,034
Oh, poppycock!

246
00:17:25,003 --> 00:17:27,004
You remember when you met Mom?

247
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:33,093
You said the first time
you touched her hand

248
00:17:33,178 --> 00:17:35,387
you just knew, instantly.

249
00:17:38,225 --> 00:17:41,393
The stars were brighter that night.

250
00:17:41,478 --> 00:17:44,563
Dad, you found true love.

251
00:17:44,648 --> 00:17:46,815
That's all I want.

252
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:50,110
They found her!

253
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:03,707
Zug-zug!

254
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:09,630
Now, if you ladies
would please have a seat,

255
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:12,174
the Prince will be right with you.

256
00:18:17,138 --> 00:18:18,847
My Prince!

257
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:22,726
Your Highness!

258
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:25,562
Oh, hello.

259
00:18:25,647 --> 00:18:30,192
Am I in the right room?
Of course I'm in the right room.

260
00:18:30,277 --> 00:18:34,071
Well, there...
There seems to be a little mix-up here.

261
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:38,325
I assure you, Your Highness,
the slipper fits my daughter's foot.

262
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:40,411
See? See?

263
00:18:40,495 --> 00:18:42,162
How could he miss it?

264
00:18:42,247 --> 00:18:44,873
Yeah, I see.

265
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:49,253
It's just that I was expecting...
Well, someone else.

266
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:51,922
I really do feel awful about this.

267
00:18:52,007 --> 00:18:54,174
But the royal proclamation declared...

268
00:18:54,259 --> 00:18:58,846
Yes, but it would appear that
more than one girl

269
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:01,724
actually fits the slipper.

270
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:05,144
I'm very sorry
to have inconvenienced you.

271
00:19:05,228 --> 00:19:09,523
Why don't I have the Grand Duke
escort you home safely.

272
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:12,318
If you'll please excuse me.

273
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:16,613
-But... But...
-Quiet!

274
00:19:18,116 --> 00:19:20,659
You will forget who you danced
with at the ball,

275
00:19:20,744 --> 00:19:23,203
and marry the girl who fits the slipper

276
00:19:23,288 --> 00:19:26,081
tonight. Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.

277
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:50,439
Wait. Hold the trumpet!

278
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:52,191
It's all coming back.

279
00:19:54,486 --> 00:19:55,778
It is you.

280
00:19:57,614 --> 00:19:59,782
Please. Please tell me your name.

281
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:03,118
It's Anastasia.

282
00:20:03,787 --> 00:20:04,995
Anastasia.

283
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:09,666
Well, I... I know it's sudden,
but will you marry me?

284
00:20:09,751 --> 00:20:11,126
Yes!

285
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:30,896
Yes.

286
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:35,526
I... I mean, yes. Definitely yes.

287
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:37,569
I will marry you.

288
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:42,282
Excellent.
The ceremony will take place tonight.

289
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:45,369
I trust that meets
with your approval, Sire.

290
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:47,204
The sooner the better.

291
00:20:47,288 --> 00:20:51,083
Splendid. Then tonight
we will have a new princess.

292
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:53,168
Wonderful. I'll go tell my father.

293
00:20:53,253 --> 00:20:56,255
Not good!
We have to find Cinderelly, Gus-Gus!

294
00:21:12,147 --> 00:21:15,315
I feel better already.

295
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:21,029
Grace and poise, girls.
Just remember, grace and poise.

296
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:24,158
Right. Grace and poise.

297
00:21:24,242 --> 00:21:26,493
Oh, look, a harp.

298
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:48,932
Lucifer?

299
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:57,733
Lucifer! Come here!

300
00:22:16,419 --> 00:22:17,836
Your Highness.

301
00:22:17,921 --> 00:22:19,171
Yes?

302
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:24,009
Hello.

303
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:26,428
It's wonderful to see you again.

304
00:22:27,972 --> 00:22:30,265
I'm sorry, have we met?

305
00:22:32,185 --> 00:22:35,437
I believe we danced last night
at the ball.

306
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:41,944
Well... Maybe you've mistaken me
for some other prince.

307
00:22:45,156 --> 00:22:46,907
I don't think so.

308
00:22:46,991 --> 00:22:48,867
You are quite the dancer.

309
00:22:48,952 --> 00:22:50,369
Well, it wasn't just me.

310
00:22:50,453 --> 00:22:54,039
It was the lady I was

311
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:55,958
dancing with.

312
00:23:04,384 --> 00:23:06,218
Oh, Your Highness.

313
00:23:06,302 --> 00:23:10,264
As a matter of fact, I'm gonna marry her.

314
00:23:10,348 --> 00:23:12,516
Marry? Really?

315
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,226
Yes! Tonight.

316
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:15,561
Tonight?

317
00:23:15,645 --> 00:23:18,063
Once you dance
with someone like Anastasia,

318
00:23:18,147 --> 00:23:19,940
you don't want to waste any time.

319
00:23:20,024 --> 00:23:21,984
Did you say Anastasia?

320
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:23,151
Yes.

321
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:24,987
But...

322
00:23:30,243 --> 00:23:33,704
Well... I guess I better be going.

323
00:23:33,788 --> 00:23:35,205
I've got to tell my father.

324
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:37,416
-But that's not right.
-I'm sorry?

325
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,669
You there. Royal mouse catcher!
I need you this...

326
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:45,173
I'm sorry, Your Grace. I didn't realise...

327
00:23:45,258 --> 00:23:46,592
I was the one...

328
00:23:46,676 --> 00:23:49,511
I need her this instant!
Please excuse us, Your Highness?

329
00:23:49,596 --> 00:23:51,597
Please. I'm sorry, just one moment.

330
00:23:51,681 --> 00:23:54,433
No, no, no.
Of course, I can see you're busy.

331
00:23:54,517 --> 00:23:56,685
I'll... I'll let you go.

332
00:23:57,687 --> 00:24:01,189
But it was me.

333
00:24:18,374 --> 00:24:21,752
Start here! I want this castle
completely rodent-free

334
00:24:21,836 --> 00:24:23,837
in time for the wedding.

335
00:24:47,236 --> 00:24:48,403
Cinderelly! Cinderelly!

336
00:24:48,738 --> 00:24:49,696
Gus?

337
00:24:49,781 --> 00:24:51,114
Cinderelly!

338
00:24:52,784 --> 00:24:54,284
We found Princey!

339
00:24:54,369 --> 00:24:58,246
I did, too.
But he doesn't even know who I am.

340
00:24:59,207 --> 00:25:00,248
No, no, no!

341
00:25:01,042 --> 00:25:02,793
It's a-magic.

342
00:25:02,877 --> 00:25:04,795
What? What are you talking about?

343
00:25:09,926 --> 00:25:11,259
Stepmother?

344
00:25:13,096 --> 00:25:15,972
-Fairy Godmother?
-Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.

345
00:25:16,057 --> 00:25:17,307
She stole it?

346
00:25:17,392 --> 00:25:19,267
-Boo-hoo-hoo!
-I show Princey!

347
00:25:20,228 --> 00:25:21,895
Princey! Princey!

348
00:25:23,481 --> 00:25:25,399
My Cinderelly awaits.

349
00:25:25,483 --> 00:25:28,443
Princey, you will marry Anastasia.

350
00:25:28,528 --> 00:25:30,028
Anaesthesia.

351
00:25:30,113 --> 00:25:32,614
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.

352
00:25:33,116 --> 00:25:36,326
She made him forget who I am.

353
00:25:38,788 --> 00:25:42,124
Magic! That explains it.

354
00:25:43,918 --> 00:25:46,086
Boys, we have to get that wand!

355
00:25:47,088 --> 00:25:50,257
Madame, the King himself
has instructed me

356
00:25:50,341 --> 00:25:52,759
to be solely in charge of this affair.

357
00:25:52,844 --> 00:25:56,263
I assure you I have it
entirely under control.

358
00:25:56,347 --> 00:25:58,056
Oh, really?

359
00:26:02,854 --> 00:26:04,521
Look at that!

360
00:26:04,605 --> 00:26:06,481
It's perfect!

361
00:26:13,573 --> 00:26:15,574
They smell lovely.

362
00:26:15,658 --> 00:26:17,743
Dispose of those roses at once.

363
00:26:17,827 --> 00:26:19,661
Anastasia's health is quite...

364
00:26:22,749 --> 00:26:24,082
...delicate.

365
00:26:24,167 --> 00:26:26,585
I'm quite sure I mentioned that to you.

366
00:26:26,669 --> 00:26:30,338
-Madam, I do not...
-Quite sure.

367
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:32,340
Yes.

368
00:26:32,425 --> 00:26:35,469
Well, perhaps the young ladies

369
00:26:35,553 --> 00:26:37,512
would like to sample the hors d'oeuvres.

370
00:26:40,349 --> 00:26:42,350
Your Grace, a word.

371
00:26:43,978 --> 00:26:47,022
These preparations
are entirely unacceptable.

372
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,109
What a pig!

373
00:26:54,238 --> 00:26:55,864
Who's the pig now?

374
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,621
You call this a cake?

375
00:27:06,501 --> 00:27:09,503
This wedding must reflect
my daughter's elegance.

376
00:27:09,587 --> 00:27:12,380
Drizella will be singing in the ceremony.

377
00:27:12,465 --> 00:27:14,466
Are you sure that's a good idea?

378
00:27:19,013 --> 00:27:21,973
Wait till you meet her, Dad.
She has everything.

379
00:27:22,058 --> 00:27:25,352
-Breeding, refinement...
-Yes, yes.

380
00:27:28,898 --> 00:27:30,232
No!

381
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:36,154
Are we in the right room?

382
00:27:36,239 --> 00:27:38,615
You! How could you let this happen?

383
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:41,201
Don't mind this.

384
00:27:41,285 --> 00:27:43,787
I shall have it cleaned up in no time.

385
00:27:43,871 --> 00:27:45,705
See that you do!

386
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:49,376
I want this wedding
to go off without a hitch.

387
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:51,920
And if it doesn't...

388
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:54,965
Oh, no! Please, Sire.

389
00:27:55,049 --> 00:27:56,925
I can explain. I, well, you see...

390
00:27:57,009 --> 00:28:01,513
Father, allow me introduce
my bride-to-be, Anastasia.

391
00:28:01,597 --> 00:28:04,891
Anastasia, this is my dad.

392
00:28:04,976 --> 00:28:07,853
It is an honour, Your Majesty.

393
00:28:07,937 --> 00:28:10,647
Charmed, I'm sure.

394
00:28:18,364 --> 00:28:21,283
So who's up for a dance?

395
00:28:22,743 --> 00:28:25,036
Your little escapade back there

396
00:28:25,121 --> 00:28:26,705
could have cost us everything!

397
00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:28,331
Don't ruin this!

398
00:28:28,416 --> 00:28:30,375
Go get him, twinkle toes.

399
00:28:39,385 --> 00:28:42,596
I don't dance much.

400
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:46,099
You're too modest.
That's how we met, remember?

401
00:28:46,183 --> 00:28:48,393
Oh, right. Of course.

402
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:51,187
I'll never forget when I first touched

403
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:53,815
your hand.

404
00:29:09,206 --> 00:29:10,749
I'm sorry.

405
00:29:10,833 --> 00:29:12,334
It won't happen again.

406
00:29:16,881 --> 00:29:28,683
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

407
00:29:38,027 --> 00:29:39,152
I'm sorry.

408
00:29:40,321 --> 00:29:41,738
Oh, dear.

409
00:29:49,205 --> 00:29:50,872
Are you okay?

410
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:56,002
Sorry, these aren't my shoes.

411
00:29:56,087 --> 00:29:59,464
I mean, what am I saying?
Of course they're my shoes.

412
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:02,968
I just don't know
what's wrong with me today.

413
00:30:03,052 --> 00:30:05,220
Oh, no, no, it was my fault.

414
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:08,598
I'm afraid I'm just not up-to-date
on the latest dance steps.

415
00:30:08,683 --> 00:30:12,769
Sire, if I may, your fitting.

416
00:30:12,853 --> 00:30:17,232
Oh, yes. This was fun. Thank you.

417
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:19,985
Well, if you'll please excuse me.

418
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:23,989
Come along, Sire.

419
00:30:24,073 --> 00:30:27,325
And after the fitting,
we must approve the butter sculpture.

420
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:29,536
I think it's a stunning likeness.

421
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:35,083
Well, no grace, no poise.

422
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:37,877
Other than that, it was lovely.

423
00:30:37,962 --> 00:30:40,672
He was nice to me.

424
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:43,675
That's because he's under a spell.

425
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:46,928
He'd have to be, to fall for you.

426
00:30:48,764 --> 00:30:50,015
It's more than that.

427
00:30:50,099 --> 00:30:51,474
Ladies!

428
00:30:54,061 --> 00:30:55,854
Your Majesty!

429
00:30:55,938 --> 00:31:00,900
I need to speak with my
future daughter-in-law immediately.

430
00:31:03,029 --> 00:31:04,738
Alone!

431
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:13,455
Let's make a run for it while we can.

432
00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:17,917
No, Sire, Sire, I'll have a dozen
dance instructors sent in immediately.

433
00:31:18,002 --> 00:31:19,335
Something's wrong.

434
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:21,713
An army of dance instructors.

435
00:31:21,797 --> 00:31:23,048
No, no.

436
00:31:23,132 --> 00:31:26,718
I thought... Why, I was sure
it was Anastasia last night.

437
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:28,970
But...

438
00:31:29,055 --> 00:31:31,639
Well, just now when I touched her hand,

439
00:31:32,975 --> 00:31:34,642
I felt

440
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:37,479
nothing.

441
00:31:38,647 --> 00:31:40,899
I can explain everything, Your Majesty.

442
00:31:40,983 --> 00:31:43,443
I have this... This inner ear thing and...

443
00:31:43,527 --> 00:31:47,238
You, my dear, are a dreadful dancer.

444
00:31:48,199 --> 00:31:50,909
Yes, I know, Your Majesty.

445
00:31:50,993 --> 00:31:53,161
Reminds me of my queen.

446
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:55,663
She trod on my feet, too.

447
00:31:56,874 --> 00:32:00,835
But she took
very good care of my heart.

448
00:32:02,213 --> 00:32:04,005
Come here, my dear.

449
00:32:05,132 --> 00:32:07,759
I want to show you something.

450
00:32:10,638 --> 00:32:13,515
A princess is bestowed
with many riches.

451
00:32:14,809 --> 00:32:18,019
Land, jewels, horses.

452
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:23,691
But today I wish to give you
something much more valuable.

453
00:32:28,405 --> 00:32:30,073
Isn't it lovely?

454
00:32:31,033 --> 00:32:32,784
A seashell?

455
00:32:32,868 --> 00:32:37,330
This shell was the queen's
most treasured possession.

456
00:32:37,873 --> 00:32:42,085
We found it while walking
by the water the day we met.

457
00:32:42,169 --> 00:32:44,921
You see, we reached for it
at the same moment,

458
00:32:45,005 --> 00:32:48,508
and when our hands touched

459
00:32:48,592 --> 00:32:52,387
that's when I knew I had found true love.

460
00:32:53,681 --> 00:32:56,891
You knew that
just by touching her hand?

461
00:32:56,976 --> 00:33:02,897
There's no more powerful force
in the world than true love.

462
00:33:08,529 --> 00:33:12,157
Well, that's all. Run along, now.

463
00:33:12,241 --> 00:33:15,410
-Run along.
-Thank you, Your Majesty.

464
00:33:16,245 --> 00:33:18,496
I do.

465
00:33:18,581 --> 00:33:20,081
Oh, I do.

466
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:25,003
I do. I do.

467
00:33:25,087 --> 00:33:27,297
I really do.

468
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:36,097
Oh, I do.

469
00:33:39,935 --> 00:33:44,355
Now there is finally someone
to love me

470
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:48,943
He'll show me a world
that l never knew

471
00:33:49,069 --> 00:33:54,199
With two simple words
all my dreams will come true

472
00:33:54,283 --> 00:34:02,624
l do

473
00:34:17,473 --> 00:34:19,682
You go get the Prince.

474
00:34:19,767 --> 00:34:21,893
Bigger!

475
00:34:21,977 --> 00:34:23,978
Let's try this!

476
00:34:25,272 --> 00:34:26,981
Oh, that's gorgeous.

477
00:34:31,654 --> 00:34:33,154
Lovely.

478
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:36,282
Drizella, stop that this instant!

479
00:34:37,826 --> 00:34:40,536
This wand is not a toy.

480
00:34:40,621 --> 00:34:43,539
It's in the dresser. Key's in her pocket.

481
00:34:47,753 --> 00:34:49,087
I've got to get in there.

482
00:34:49,171 --> 00:34:50,797
Cinderelly! They'll see you!

483
00:34:50,881 --> 00:34:52,590
-Yeah, too dangerous.
-But I...

484
00:34:52,675 --> 00:34:54,217
We'll take care of it!

485
00:34:54,301 --> 00:34:55,677
I do.

486
00:34:56,136 --> 00:35:04,018
I do. I do.

487
00:35:11,527 --> 00:35:15,655
All right, but whatever you do,
stay clear of Lucifer.

488
00:35:15,739 --> 00:35:17,907
Zug-zug. No Lucifee.

489
00:35:19,076 --> 00:35:20,827
What happened?
What did the King say?

490
00:35:22,246 --> 00:35:24,289
He's really very nice.

491
00:35:24,373 --> 00:35:27,166
He gave me
his most prized possession.

492
00:35:28,502 --> 00:35:29,669
A seashell?

493
00:35:29,753 --> 00:35:32,046
It's a symbol of true love.

494
00:35:32,798 --> 00:35:34,424
Oh, please.

495
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:40,263
-How special.
-He said that his heart...

496
00:35:40,347 --> 00:35:44,100
What is love compared
to the power we hold with the wand?

497
00:35:44,184 --> 00:35:46,185
You will learn that soon enough.

498
00:35:47,646 --> 00:35:49,856
I want the Prince to love me.

499
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,899
I think he could.

500
00:35:51,984 --> 00:35:55,737
Oh, you're serious.

501
00:35:55,821 --> 00:35:57,822
Well, the King likes me, too.

502
00:35:57,906 --> 00:36:01,743
He treated me like his own daughter.
Maybe we shouldn't be doing this.

503
00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:05,079
Maybe I should have put on the slipper.

504
00:36:06,248 --> 00:36:08,624
Maybe we don't even need the wand.

505
00:36:17,593 --> 00:36:20,136
Somebody put out the cat!

506
00:36:22,765 --> 00:36:26,392
Lucifer! Oh, hold still! Stop!

507
00:36:37,488 --> 00:36:39,322
Lucifer!

508
00:36:41,367 --> 00:36:42,700
Someone fetch the housekeeper.

509
00:36:46,163 --> 00:36:47,955
Housekeeping.

510
00:36:51,794 --> 00:36:54,128
Well, you certainly came quickly.

511
00:36:54,213 --> 00:36:57,006
We're very good.

512
00:37:01,762 --> 00:37:05,932
Clean this up. My daughter needs her
beauty sleep before tonight's wedding.

513
00:37:06,016 --> 00:37:08,643
Think that'll be enough time?

514
00:37:24,535 --> 00:37:27,161
Keep out of the maid's way, girls.

515
00:37:27,246 --> 00:37:30,164
There's a lot to do before the wedding.

516
00:37:36,672 --> 00:37:39,799
Isn't that right, Cinderella?

517
00:37:41,718 --> 00:37:43,678
I didn't know you worked here.

518
00:37:45,848 --> 00:37:48,141
You're far more persistent
than I thought.

519
00:37:48,225 --> 00:37:50,101
I won't let you get away with this.

520
00:37:50,185 --> 00:37:53,187
-We already have.
-I don't think so.

521
00:37:53,272 --> 00:37:54,856
Jaq! Gus!

522
00:37:57,943 --> 00:37:59,861
The wand!

523
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:03,197
Us a-coming, Cinderelly!

524
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:08,703
Yeah!

525
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:12,540
That servant girl is a thief! Get her!

526
00:38:14,668 --> 00:38:16,043
Zug-zug.

527
00:38:18,005 --> 00:38:19,714
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.

528
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:33,060
Stop! Thief!

529
00:38:33,145 --> 00:38:35,771
-Seize her at once!
-Don't move! Hold it!

530
00:38:35,856 --> 00:38:37,356
Halt in the name of the King!

531
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,117
You incompetent fools!

532
00:38:55,501 --> 00:38:58,252
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!

533
00:39:05,636 --> 00:39:07,136
Gus-Gus!

534
00:39:17,105 --> 00:39:18,940
Run, Gus-Gus!

535
00:39:19,024 --> 00:39:20,566
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!

536
00:39:31,578 --> 00:39:33,704
There she is! We've got her.

537
00:39:33,789 --> 00:39:35,206
You there, halt!

538
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:36,415
Halt!

539
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:40,461
Open up in the name of the King!

540
00:39:43,173 --> 00:39:45,216
Oh, hello.

541
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,802
Oh! Hey! What's going on?

542
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,474
All right, I'm coming.

543
00:39:53,559 --> 00:39:54,934
Cinderelly!

544
00:39:55,018 --> 00:39:56,602
Open up, I say!

545
00:39:56,687 --> 00:39:57,979
Gus-Gus!

546
00:40:01,275 --> 00:40:02,608
Catch.

547
00:40:05,529 --> 00:40:07,446
Open up in the name of the King!

548
00:40:09,032 --> 00:40:11,158
Lift the spell. Let him remember.

549
00:40:11,994 --> 00:40:13,953
Bibbidi-bobbidi...

550
00:40:18,125 --> 00:40:19,750
No!

551
00:40:19,835 --> 00:40:21,919
-What's going on?
-My apologies.

552
00:40:22,004 --> 00:40:24,005
It's a problem with my maid.

553
00:40:24,089 --> 00:40:26,507
-It's under control.
-Are you okay?

554
00:40:26,592 --> 00:40:29,635
-This servant girl is a thief.
-I am not a thief.

555
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:33,180
You're under a spell. That's why
you don't remember me. Please!

556
00:40:33,265 --> 00:40:34,348
Just listen!

557
00:40:41,732 --> 00:40:43,024
Let go!

558
00:40:43,984 --> 00:40:47,236
Poor child. Obviously out of her mind.

559
00:40:47,321 --> 00:40:48,946
I hope she'll be all right.

560
00:40:49,031 --> 00:40:52,033
She seemed, you know,
nice when I met her.

561
00:40:52,117 --> 00:40:54,619
Well, maybe a little confused, but,

562
00:40:54,703 --> 00:40:56,829
still there's something about her...

563
00:40:56,913 --> 00:41:00,207
Oh, don't trouble yourself,
Your Highness.

564
00:41:00,292 --> 00:41:04,712
I'll see to it, personally,
that she gets all the help she needs.

565
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:08,883
Nice try, but we won!

566
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:11,385
You won? What do you mean?

567
00:41:13,221 --> 00:41:14,555
Well...

568
00:41:15,557 --> 00:41:17,016
Nothing.

569
00:41:17,934 --> 00:41:19,226
I...

570
00:41:20,729 --> 00:41:22,897
You'll see she's taken care of?

571
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:25,316
Personally, Your Highness.

572
00:41:28,487 --> 00:41:30,946
Put her on the next ship
leaving the kingdom.

573
00:41:31,031 --> 00:41:33,407
I want her banished forever.

574
00:41:35,786 --> 00:41:37,370
And you...

575
00:41:37,454 --> 00:41:39,955
Keep your mouth shut or you're next.

576
00:41:42,417 --> 00:41:44,043
Quite fetching.

577
00:41:46,254 --> 00:41:48,089
Careful with those pins down there.

578
00:41:48,924 --> 00:41:51,175
Dad, something strange is going on.

579
00:41:51,259 --> 00:41:54,887
I'll say. My son is finally getting married.

580
00:41:54,971 --> 00:41:57,139
No. No, I mean something's wrong.

581
00:41:57,224 --> 00:42:01,519
Oh, nonsense, my boy. You wanted
the girl who fit the glass slipper.

582
00:42:01,603 --> 00:42:03,479
-Yes, but...
-Now you've got her.

583
00:42:03,563 --> 00:42:04,897
Hey.

584
00:42:04,981 --> 00:42:06,691
That's what I'm worried about.

585
00:42:06,775 --> 00:42:07,983
Hey, Princey! Prince!

586
00:42:08,151 --> 00:42:10,611
-Over here!
-Princey!

587
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:16,784
-Me?
-Yes, you. Let's go.

588
00:42:19,955 --> 00:42:23,791
Okay, first birds, now mice.

589
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:25,459
Come on!

590
00:42:40,642 --> 00:42:41,892
Hello?

591
00:42:46,189 --> 00:42:49,442
Hello? Little mice?

592
00:42:52,738 --> 00:42:55,948
Well, it's official. I've lost my mind.

593
00:42:56,032 --> 00:43:00,077
First I was hijacked by birds,
and now I'm talking to imaginary mice.

594
00:43:03,707 --> 00:43:05,458
Hey, Prince-Prince! Down here!

595
00:43:05,542 --> 00:43:06,917
Okay.

596
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:10,421
Maybe not so imaginary.

597
00:43:10,505 --> 00:43:13,841
Stepmother got a magic wand,
put spell on you. Fooled everyone.

598
00:43:13,925 --> 00:43:15,760
...came to the palace to marry you!

599
00:43:15,844 --> 00:43:18,971
Wait, hold on. Hold on.
I think I understand.

600
00:43:20,474 --> 00:43:22,016
Actually, I got nothing.

601
00:43:24,686 --> 00:43:26,228
What should we gonna do?

602
00:43:33,153 --> 00:43:35,613
You were dancing
with a very pretty girl

603
00:43:35,697 --> 00:43:37,364
-Pretty girl
-At midnight she ran off

604
00:43:37,449 --> 00:43:39,283
-ln such a whirl
-Such a whirl

605
00:43:39,367 --> 00:43:42,119
Her name was Cinderelly
She's the servant girl you met

606
00:43:42,204 --> 00:43:43,662
She's the one you want to marry

607
00:43:43,747 --> 00:43:45,414
Don't forget!
Don't forget!

608
00:43:45,499 --> 00:43:48,459
-At the ball, at the ball
-At the ball, at the ball

609
00:43:48,543 --> 00:43:51,212
Cinderelly was the maiden at the ball

610
00:43:51,296 --> 00:43:53,589
No, I danced with Anastasia at the ball.

611
00:43:54,049 --> 00:43:58,093
No, no. Princey only think that
because of Cinderelly's stepmother.

612
00:43:58,178 --> 00:44:00,429
Yeah, mean old lady.

613
00:44:00,514 --> 00:44:02,556
With a magic wand
she cast a wicked spell

614
00:44:02,641 --> 00:44:03,933
Wicked spell

615
00:44:04,017 --> 00:44:05,810
Which is why Princey isn't feeling well

616
00:44:05,894 --> 00:44:07,895
-Not so well
-You've forgotten Cinderelly

617
00:44:07,979 --> 00:44:09,814
And the dance you shared last night

618
00:44:09,898 --> 00:44:12,274
But we know it's not too late
to set things right

619
00:44:12,359 --> 00:44:14,860
'Cause at the ball!
At the ball! At the ball!

620
00:44:14,945 --> 00:44:17,947
-Yeah, at the ball
-Cinderelly was the maiden at the ball

621
00:44:18,031 --> 00:44:19,323
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Wait!

622
00:44:19,407 --> 00:44:21,617
You're telling me
I'm under a magic spell?

623
00:44:21,701 --> 00:44:23,702
And here's the worst part.

624
00:44:23,787 --> 00:44:26,163
When Cinderelly tried her best
to take a stand

625
00:44:26,248 --> 00:44:27,289
Take a stand

626
00:44:27,374 --> 00:44:30,334
Mean old lady had her
banished from the land

627
00:44:33,588 --> 00:44:35,464
Gus-Gus!

628
00:44:35,549 --> 00:44:36,674
Sorry.

629
00:44:37,676 --> 00:44:40,469
Cinderelly's on a ship
that's gonna sail her far away

630
00:44:40,554 --> 00:44:42,680
lt's up to Princey-Prince
to save the day

631
00:44:42,764 --> 00:44:44,348
'Cause at the ball
At the ball

632
00:44:44,432 --> 00:44:46,183
-At the ball
-What a ball

633
00:44:46,268 --> 00:44:47,726
Cinderelly won your heart

634
00:44:47,811 --> 00:44:49,270
Now magic's keeping you apart

635
00:44:49,354 --> 00:44:50,813
And she'll soon be gone forever

636
00:44:50,897 --> 00:44:52,773
Unless you can recall

637
00:44:52,858 --> 00:44:57,945
That Cinderelly
was the maiden at the ball

638
00:44:58,029 --> 00:44:59,405
At the ball!

639
00:44:59,489 --> 00:45:00,573
Magic?

640
00:45:01,408 --> 00:45:05,119
Magic made me think Anastasia
was the girl at the ball?

641
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,998
That would explain everything.

642
00:45:09,082 --> 00:45:10,708
Yeah!

643
00:45:20,719 --> 00:45:23,095
What? The servant girl?

644
00:45:23,179 --> 00:45:26,891
This Cinderelly? This belongs to her?

645
00:45:26,975 --> 00:45:29,518
-Yeah! Yeah!
-I have to find her.

646
00:45:29,603 --> 00:45:32,521
-Yeah! Yeah!
-Yeah! Yeah!

647
00:45:34,065 --> 00:45:37,234
-One more time.
-Yeah.

648
00:45:37,319 --> 00:45:39,236
At the ball! At the ball!

649
00:45:39,321 --> 00:45:41,280
We showed ol' Princey after all

650
00:45:41,364 --> 00:45:45,200
That Cinderelly was the maiden

651
00:45:45,285 --> 00:45:48,787
At the ball!

652
00:45:51,666 --> 00:45:53,792
Oh, thanks.

653
00:45:53,877 --> 00:45:56,086
And loved the song.

654
00:45:56,171 --> 00:45:58,672
-Go! Go! Go, Princey! Shoo! Shoo!
-Go! Go!

655
00:46:00,842 --> 00:46:02,384
I have to go.

656
00:46:02,469 --> 00:46:05,262
Go? But you're about to be married.

657
00:46:06,473 --> 00:46:09,099
But the talking mice
say she's the wrong girl.

658
00:46:09,184 --> 00:46:11,769
Son, wait!

659
00:46:12,854 --> 00:46:16,148
Son! Talking mice? Son?

660
00:46:17,442 --> 00:46:19,860
-And two bluebirds.
-Talking bluebirds?

661
00:46:21,529 --> 00:46:24,406
No, the bluebirds weren't talking.
Look, Dad...

662
00:46:24,491 --> 00:46:25,991
This is ridiculous.

663
00:46:26,076 --> 00:46:28,577
You agreed to marry the girl
in the glass slipper.

664
00:46:28,662 --> 00:46:31,705
-I was completely with you on that one.
-And I will.

665
00:46:32,874 --> 00:46:34,083
Just as soon as I find her.

666
00:46:34,167 --> 00:46:38,712
I forbid you
to take another step down these stairs!

667
00:46:40,882 --> 00:46:41,882
Okay.

668
00:46:43,718 --> 00:46:46,428
Son! Come back!

669
00:46:46,513 --> 00:46:49,431
We'll find you a doctor.
We'll have you leeched.

670
00:46:53,061 --> 00:46:55,354
We've got to get...

671
00:46:55,438 --> 00:46:57,356
Guards!

672
00:47:00,902 --> 00:47:03,737
The servant girl. Where is she?

673
00:47:04,155 --> 00:47:06,824
Guards! He's gone completely mad!

674
00:47:06,908 --> 00:47:08,659
-Your Majesty!
-Stop my son.

675
00:47:08,743 --> 00:47:10,786
Your blood pressure!

676
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:12,913
Stop! Stop!

677
00:47:12,998 --> 00:47:14,331
Dad, trust me.

678
00:47:14,416 --> 00:47:17,543
Son! I do trust you.

679
00:47:17,627 --> 00:47:20,254
It's the talking mice I'm worried about.

680
00:47:24,009 --> 00:47:25,009
Son!

681
00:47:25,093 --> 00:47:27,469
Close the gates! Close the gates!

682
00:47:35,311 --> 00:47:37,855
It'll be fine. Don't look up.

683
00:47:43,445 --> 00:47:45,320
Good boy.

684
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:49,658
-Yeah!
-Go get her, Princey!

685
00:47:52,203 --> 00:47:55,039
I'll send the troops after him at once,
Your Majesty.

686
00:47:55,123 --> 00:47:57,207
No, let him go.

687
00:47:57,292 --> 00:47:59,460
But... But, Your Majesty, the wedding.

688
00:47:59,544 --> 00:48:01,211
Let him go.

689
00:48:19,397 --> 00:48:21,231
Time to go.

690
00:48:31,076 --> 00:48:33,494
All hands on deck.

691
00:48:54,641 --> 00:48:57,601
l've always dreamed

692
00:48:57,685 --> 00:49:00,896
That my life could be

693
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:03,357
Like a fairy tale

694
00:49:03,441 --> 00:49:07,194
A perfect fantasy

695
00:49:13,535 --> 00:49:16,203
But it was nothing more

696
00:49:17,288 --> 00:49:19,915
Than a dream

697
00:49:19,999 --> 00:49:22,709
Loose the mainsail!

698
00:50:11,885 --> 00:50:14,261
Come on, boy! Nothing to it.

699
00:50:53,426 --> 00:50:54,760
Remember me?

700
00:51:22,497 --> 00:51:25,624
Will you marry me, Cinderelly?

701
00:51:25,708 --> 00:51:28,585
Yes, but...

702
00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:31,713
Actually, it's Cinderella.

703
00:51:31,798 --> 00:51:34,258
Cinderella!

704
00:51:35,176 --> 00:51:37,261
-It's not over yet!
-What?

705
00:51:37,345 --> 00:51:40,180
He thinks he can ruin my plans.

706
00:51:40,265 --> 00:51:42,766
-I think not.
-Who?

707
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:45,936
The Prince. He's gone after Cinderella.

708
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:49,690
-But I thought he loved me.
-Mother!

709
00:52:03,121 --> 00:52:04,788
Guards! Guards!

710
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:12,296
It's no use. The magic didn't work.

711
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:13,922
It wasn't as powerful as their...

712
00:52:14,007 --> 00:52:16,341
-You want the Prince to love you?
-Open up!

713
00:52:16,426 --> 00:52:18,343
Well, yes. Yes, of course I do.

714
00:52:18,428 --> 00:52:20,012
More than anything.

715
00:52:20,096 --> 00:52:22,764
-Then do exactly as I say.
-Open up!

716
00:52:22,849 --> 00:52:24,975
Open up in the name of the King!

717
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:34,776
Using magic on my son. The nerve.

718
00:52:34,861 --> 00:52:38,405
Your Majesty, we've gone over
every inch of the castle.

719
00:52:38,489 --> 00:52:39,990
It appears they have fled.

720
00:52:40,908 --> 00:52:43,285
Then search my entire kingdom!

721
00:52:43,369 --> 00:52:47,414
I want them found and arrested,
immediately!

722
00:52:50,084 --> 00:52:52,044
Keep in mind that I'm an old man

723
00:52:52,128 --> 00:52:55,088
and my heart can only take so much.

724
00:52:55,173 --> 00:52:57,466
Please, please, please,

725
00:52:57,550 --> 00:53:01,303
tell me that this is the girl
you intend to marry.

726
00:53:03,389 --> 00:53:05,682
All the stars are shining brighter, Dad,

727
00:53:05,767 --> 00:53:07,851
just like you said.

728
00:53:07,935 --> 00:53:09,644
Then what are we waiting for?

729
00:53:10,938 --> 00:53:14,399
Fetch the florist!
Bake an even bigger cake.

730
00:53:14,484 --> 00:53:17,361
The wedding is on tonight!

731
00:53:19,822 --> 00:53:23,784
No. This a way?

732
00:53:25,828 --> 00:53:27,746
No, no, no, no, thatta way.

733
00:53:27,830 --> 00:53:28,997
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

734
00:53:29,791 --> 00:53:31,041
Yes.

735
00:53:32,418 --> 00:53:34,127
Thank you.

736
00:53:35,338 --> 00:53:37,631
How lovely you look, my dear.

737
00:53:37,715 --> 00:53:39,049
Stepmother?

738
00:53:52,897 --> 00:53:55,190
It appears you were right, Cinderella.

739
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:58,151
The Prince does want to marry you.

740
00:53:58,236 --> 00:54:01,321
And marry you he shall.

741
00:54:01,406 --> 00:54:03,198
Anastasia.

742
00:54:04,325 --> 00:54:05,367
Anastasia!

743
00:54:18,589 --> 00:54:22,008
Or should I say "Cinderella."

744
00:54:25,012 --> 00:54:26,680
What have you done?

745
00:54:26,764 --> 00:54:28,723
The Prince won't be fooled.

746
00:54:28,808 --> 00:54:30,642
The Prince will never know.

747
00:54:30,726 --> 00:54:33,019
He'll be perfectly happy.

748
00:54:34,272 --> 00:54:38,191
But will you, Anastasia?
Will you be happy?

749
00:54:38,276 --> 00:54:41,319
I... I want what you had.

750
00:54:41,404 --> 00:54:43,905
But do you even love him?

751
00:54:43,990 --> 00:54:47,284
-I...
-Love! Look where it's gotten you.

752
00:54:48,953 --> 00:55:03,800
Cinderelly!

753
00:55:03,885 --> 00:55:06,052
What's happened, Cinderelly?

754
00:55:24,739 --> 00:55:28,325
Lucifer, make absolutely certain
they don't come back

755
00:55:29,368 --> 00:55:31,411
alive.

756
00:55:31,496 --> 00:55:33,413
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.

757
00:55:44,091 --> 00:55:45,258
Lucifer?

758
00:56:03,945 --> 00:56:05,445
We need to stop this thing.

759
00:56:05,530 --> 00:56:07,614
Right away, Cinderelly.

760
00:56:07,698 --> 00:56:09,533
Okay, okay. Chop-chop.

761
00:56:15,456 --> 00:56:17,541
Gus, can you reach the pin?

762
00:56:17,625 --> 00:56:19,125
Zug-zug.

763
00:56:46,904 --> 00:56:48,572
Gus-Gus!

764
00:56:52,118 --> 00:56:53,159
Jaq!

765
00:56:57,790 --> 00:57:00,166
Gus, hold on!

766
00:57:04,672 --> 00:57:06,381
Lucifer!

767
00:57:06,465 --> 00:57:08,174
Let him go!

768
00:57:10,845 --> 00:57:12,554
Gus!

769
00:57:22,481 --> 00:57:23,690
Bad kitty!

770
00:57:42,043 --> 00:57:44,044
Jaq! Gus!

771
00:58:24,251 --> 00:58:25,669
Now what are we gonna do?

772
00:58:26,295 --> 00:58:28,546
Well, I'm not gonna
miss my own wedding.

773
00:58:47,775 --> 00:58:50,110
Oh, thank you, my dear.

774
00:58:50,194 --> 00:58:53,321
This is all his mother
and I have ever wanted.

775
00:58:53,739 --> 00:58:58,034
To know that our son
has found his true love.

776
00:58:58,119 --> 00:59:03,039
So, you know it's love when
you touch someone's hand, right?

777
00:59:03,124 --> 00:59:04,999
At least, that's what I've heard.

778
00:59:05,084 --> 00:59:08,795
Why, yes!
That's what I've always thought.

779
01:00:04,518 --> 01:00:06,978
Dearly beloved...

780
01:00:07,062 --> 01:00:10,023
So far, so good, Your Majesty.

781
01:00:10,107 --> 01:00:11,983
He's not married yet.

782
01:00:12,067 --> 01:00:15,028
...to join together this man

783
01:00:15,112 --> 01:00:17,113
and this woman...

784
01:00:17,198 --> 01:00:19,657
My one and only Cinderella.

785
01:00:19,742 --> 01:00:21,868
...in matrimony.

786
01:00:24,747 --> 01:00:27,874
We're almost there.

787
01:00:36,509 --> 01:00:37,675
Halt!

788
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:41,930
...Cinderella, take this man
as your lawfully

789
01:00:42,014 --> 01:00:43,640
wedded husband?

790
01:00:43,724 --> 01:00:46,935
You don't understand, I must get inside.

791
01:00:47,019 --> 01:00:49,979
-Please.
-Just say it. Say, "I do."

792
01:00:50,064 --> 01:00:51,105
I...

793
01:01:00,741 --> 01:01:01,825
I

794
01:01:04,245 --> 01:01:05,245
don't.

795
01:01:07,081 --> 01:01:08,122
Anastasia.

796
01:01:08,791 --> 01:01:09,916
Cinderella.

797
01:01:13,379 --> 01:01:16,005
Spoiled little ingrate.

798
01:01:16,090 --> 01:01:19,175
I've given you everything
you ever wanted, Anastasia!

799
01:01:19,260 --> 01:01:21,928
But I want someone to love me, for me.

800
01:01:22,012 --> 01:01:25,515
Guards! Guards! Seize that woman!

801
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:29,227
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!

802
01:01:47,913 --> 01:01:51,499
-And now for you!
-Turn her into a toad, Mother.

803
01:01:51,584 --> 01:01:53,835
Stop! No more!

804
01:01:53,919 --> 01:01:56,462
-Even better.
-Cinderella!

805
01:01:56,547 --> 01:01:58,089
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!

806
01:01:58,799 --> 01:02:05,138
No!

807
01:02:20,321 --> 01:02:25,074
This is the real Cinderella,
your true love.

808
01:02:37,588 --> 01:02:39,505
It's you.

809
01:02:56,565 --> 01:02:59,525
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.

810
01:03:06,367 --> 01:03:09,202
I can't take much more of this.

811
01:03:11,997 --> 01:03:13,331
Anastasia.

812
01:03:20,547 --> 01:03:22,340
Thank you.

813
01:03:25,052 --> 01:03:27,387
Bibbidi-bobbidi...

814
01:03:28,555 --> 01:03:29,597
Boo.

815
01:03:32,518 --> 01:03:36,771
Oh, goodness! I certainly am stiff.

816
01:03:38,607 --> 01:03:40,191
Your Majesty,

817
01:03:40,901 --> 01:03:42,860
I don't deserve this.

818
01:03:48,409 --> 01:03:51,619
Everyone deserves true love.

819
01:04:01,255 --> 01:04:03,756
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.

820
01:04:07,386 --> 01:04:08,636
Thank you.

821
01:04:12,099 --> 01:04:15,685
Would you like me to return you
to your former lives?

822
01:04:16,812 --> 01:04:18,146
Former lives?

823
01:04:18,230 --> 01:04:20,982
Why, yes. You see, you two...

824
01:04:21,066 --> 01:04:23,401
Well, you were already...

825
01:04:24,445 --> 01:04:26,112
Oh, never mind.

826
01:04:26,196 --> 01:04:29,490
Well? Does anyone want
to marry my son?

827
01:04:32,953 --> 01:04:34,620
I do.

828
01:04:36,248 --> 01:04:39,208
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

829
01:05:13,702 --> 01:05:17,371
And they lived happily ever after,

830
01:05:17,456 --> 01:05:18,956
again.

831
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:37,892
Somehow l know l will find a way

832
01:05:37,976 --> 01:05:40,436
To a brighter day

833
01:05:40,521 --> 01:05:43,606
ln the sun

834
01:05:43,690 --> 01:05:47,860
Somewhere l know that he waits for me

835
01:05:47,945 --> 01:05:50,696

Although it may hide

846

For a while

847
01:06:45,252 --> 01:06:49,338
With just one touch
love can conquer fears

848
01:06:49,423 --> 01:06:52,008
Turning all your tears

849
01:06:52,092 --> 01:06:55,178

And make your heart sing
