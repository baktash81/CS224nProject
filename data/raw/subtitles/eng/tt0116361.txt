1
00:02:58,183 --> 00:03:01,269
Okay, we've got a four-word
sentence here for you.

2
00:03:01,603 --> 00:03:02,237
What is it?

3
00:03:02,437 --> 00:03:03,362
Vanessa.

4
00:03:05,315 --> 00:03:06,365
Vanessa, come on.

5
00:03:08,109 --> 00:03:09,160
Here we go...

6
00:03:10,486 --> 00:03:11,621
The, the,

7
00:03:15,116 --> 00:03:16,117
um, ca, ca...

8
00:03:23,499 --> 00:03:24,550
Meow.

9
00:03:28,213 --> 00:03:30,256
- Cat.
- Perfect, you've got it.

10
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,675
Now let's continue to the third word.

11
00:03:33,009 --> 00:03:34,469
- Dr, drin-
- Think.

12
00:03:36,596 --> 00:03:37,847
K followed by S.

13
00:03:39,766 --> 00:03:40,816
Thin-k-s.

14
00:03:43,686 --> 00:03:44,687
Um, drinks,

15
00:03:48,399 --> 00:03:49,859
drinks.
- You've got it.

16
00:03:50,193 --> 00:03:51,161
That's it exactly.

17
00:03:51,361 --> 00:03:52,278
- Drinks.
- You did it.

18
00:03:52,612 --> 00:03:54,239
Perfect, perfect girl.

19
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:58,076
The cat drinks

20
00:04:01,621 --> 00:04:04,123
milk.
- That's right very good.

21
00:04:06,251 --> 00:04:07,335
Great Vanessa.

22
00:04:13,007 --> 00:04:13,767
Vanessa!

23
00:04:13,967 --> 00:04:14,892
Chopper!

24
00:04:18,596 --> 00:04:19,931
Are we rewarded now?

25
00:04:50,461 --> 00:04:53,256
Hey mister, I got my own place.

26
00:04:53,589 --> 00:04:54,557
Mm-mm.

27
00:04:54,757 --> 00:04:56,509
It's right over there in the motel.

28
00:04:56,843 --> 00:04:57,477
Mm-mm.

29
00:04:57,677 --> 00:04:58,928
You can turn right here and just get in.

30
00:04:59,262 --> 00:04:59,938
It's cooler.

31
00:05:00,138 --> 00:05:01,139
Then can I get in the car with you?

32
00:05:01,472 --> 00:05:02,273
- Mm-mm.
- Please sir.

33
00:05:02,473 --> 00:05:03,850
I'll go wherever you want to go.

34
00:05:04,183 --> 00:05:04,818
I'll go where ever you want to go.

35
00:05:05,018 --> 00:05:05,652
Move it, now.

36
00:05:05,852 --> 00:05:06,486
No, thank you.

37
00:05:06,686 --> 00:05:07,320
Come on sir.

38
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,154
Sir!

39
00:05:08,354 --> 00:05:09,114
Well screw you too.

40
00:05:09,314 --> 00:05:10,565
Fucking nigger.

41
00:05:10,898 --> 00:05:13,109
Mom, what are you doing?

42
00:05:13,443 --> 00:05:14,736
What are you
doing home so early?

43
00:05:15,069 --> 00:05:16,904
It's not so early, Mom.

44
00:05:17,238 --> 00:05:17,956
How are you doing Ms. Lutz?

45
00:05:18,156 --> 00:05:20,366
Don't even talk to her Chopper.

46
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,201
Vanessa, I'm out of here.

47
00:05:22,535 --> 00:05:23,253
Okay.

48
00:05:23,453 --> 00:05:25,288
Will you give your
mom my regards for me?

49
00:05:25,621 --> 00:05:27,332
Will do Ms. Lutz.

50
00:05:27,665 --> 00:05:29,208
You said you weren't going
to do this no more, Mom.

51
00:05:29,542 --> 00:05:31,586
Listen, I've had enough
crap from your father all day.

52
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:32,554
I'm really stressed out here.

53
00:05:32,754 --> 00:05:33,596
Larry is not my dad.

54
00:05:33,796 --> 00:05:35,381
Listen if you're going
to smartass me you can just

55
00:05:35,715 --> 00:05:36,724
go on home right now.

56
00:05:36,924 --> 00:05:38,259
Get out of my face right now.

57
00:05:38,593 --> 00:05:39,227
Go on!

58
00:05:39,427 --> 00:05:40,061
Get out!

59
00:05:40,261 --> 00:05:41,187
Fine.

60
00:05:41,804 --> 00:05:42,605
Fine!

61
00:05:42,805 --> 00:05:44,432
You don't know nothing about nothing.

62
00:05:44,766 --> 00:05:48,311
You don't know a goddamn
thing about nothing.

63
00:05:54,859 --> 00:05:57,070
Larry, just let me through.

64
00:05:58,946 --> 00:06:00,323
What's the magic word?

65
00:06:00,656 --> 00:06:03,117
Fuck you, you piece of shit.

66
00:06:03,451 --> 00:06:04,460
Fuck you?

67
00:06:18,049 --> 00:06:19,467
How was school?

68
00:06:19,801 --> 00:06:22,095
Like you really fucking care.

69
00:06:22,428 --> 00:06:23,229
Fuckin' asshole.

70
00:06:23,429 --> 00:06:24,063
Hey!

71
00:06:24,263 --> 00:06:25,348
Me and your momma, we spent the whole day

72
00:06:25,681 --> 00:06:26,849
in line securing rent vouchers,

73
00:06:27,183 --> 00:06:29,435
and we can both use a
little consideration?

74
00:06:35,066 --> 00:06:36,943
Don't it bother you
your own wife bringing

75
00:06:37,276 --> 00:06:39,195
off all them strange guys for money?

76
00:06:39,529 --> 00:06:40,655
I make her use mouthwash after.

77
00:06:40,988 --> 00:06:43,032
Oh you like that minty fresh taste, huh?

78
00:06:43,366 --> 00:06:44,534
You know something Vanessa Lutz?

79
00:06:44,867 --> 00:06:47,412
I'm getting ready to take a
seriously big shit right on top

80
00:06:47,745 --> 00:06:49,497
of that pointy little head of yours.

81
00:06:49,831 --> 00:06:51,249
Don't be a smartass.

82
00:06:53,084 --> 00:06:57,004
Hey motherfucker.

83
00:06:58,965 --> 00:07:00,508
You want some company?

84
00:07:00,842 --> 00:07:02,017
- Yeah.
- <i>Oh.</i>

85
00:07:02,635 --> 00:07:03,394
Let me get in.

86
00:07:03,594 --> 00:07:05,096
You get the luckiest brakes.

87
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:06,514
And I mean lucky.

88
00:07:06,848 --> 00:07:08,224
What else could it be?

89
00:07:08,558 --> 00:07:09,442
We interrupt this program

90
00:07:09,642 --> 00:07:10,601
to go live to LA County

91
00:07:10,935 --> 00:07:13,187
Sheriff's Headquarters where
a press conference is now

92
00:07:13,521 --> 00:07:16,274
in progress regarding the
grisly find yesterday morning

93
00:07:16,607 --> 00:07:18,943
along San Diego freeway in Torrance.

94
00:07:19,277 --> 00:07:21,070
The two females have been identified as

95
00:07:21,404 --> 00:07:23,990
19-year-old Tempest Mueller

96
00:07:24,323 --> 00:07:28,870
of Downey and 16-year-old
Corky Poindexter of Bellflower.

97
00:07:30,204 --> 00:07:33,875
Both females have extensive
arrest records for prostitution

98
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:37,795
and we are now considering them
as victims of the individual

99
00:07:38,129 --> 00:07:41,299
that we call the I-5 killer.

100
00:07:42,717 --> 00:07:45,428
I'll take a few questions.

101
00:07:45,761 --> 00:07:47,889
I happen to be watching that Larry.

102
00:07:48,222 --> 00:07:49,265
Forget it.

103
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:50,725
You know you just don't
want me hearing about

104
00:07:51,058 --> 00:07:51,976
that killer out there.

105
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:54,645
Well, what if he drove up
right this second and snatched

106
00:07:54,979 --> 00:07:56,022
up Mom, huh?

107
00:07:56,355 --> 00:07:58,232
What would you have to
say then, smart guy?

108
00:07:58,566 --> 00:08:01,777
First of all,
your momma would kick his ass.

109
00:08:02,111 --> 00:08:04,155
And second of all,

110
00:08:04,489 --> 00:08:07,783
that killer is all the way up in LA, okay?

111
00:08:29,472 --> 00:08:32,016
♪ My dog's better than your dog ♪

112
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:34,185
♪ My dog's better than yours ♪

113
00:08:35,436 --> 00:08:37,522
♪ My dog's better 'cause
he gets Ken-L Ration ♪

114
00:08:37,855 --> 00:08:40,900
♪ My dog's better than yous ♪

115
00:08:41,234 --> 00:08:43,653
Larry, get your goddamn
hands off my anatomy.

116
00:08:43,986 --> 00:08:44,987
I swear to fucking God.

117
00:08:45,321 --> 00:08:46,614
What?

118
00:08:46,948 --> 00:08:48,407
What are you going to do?

119
00:08:48,741 --> 00:08:49,500
I'll tell mom.

120
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:52,453
Oh yeah, like she's
really going to believe you.

121
00:08:52,787 --> 00:08:55,289
You know I'm really not up
for your shit today Larry.

122
00:08:55,623 --> 00:08:57,250
In fact, I'm mad as hell at you right now.

123
00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:58,501
Awe, come here.

124
00:08:58,834 --> 00:08:59,835
Goddammit Larry!

125
00:09:00,169 --> 00:09:01,963
Get your fucking hands off me.

126
00:09:02,296 --> 00:09:02,972
You shithead.

127
00:09:03,172 --> 00:09:04,098
Ow!

128
00:09:05,675 --> 00:09:06,884
Fucker!

129
00:09:07,218 --> 00:09:08,186
Ah!

130
00:09:08,386 --> 00:09:09,312
Ah!

131
00:09:09,512 --> 00:09:10,438
You hit hard.

132
00:09:10,638 --> 00:09:11,606
Ow!

133
00:09:11,806 --> 00:09:12,731
Ow!

134
00:09:13,599 --> 00:09:14,359
Ow!

135
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:15,851
You just behave.

136
00:09:17,103 --> 00:09:18,771
Fuck, you hit hard.

137
00:09:19,855 --> 00:09:22,567
You know I can't help you if
you don't tell me what it is

138
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:23,826
you want.

139
00:09:25,319 --> 00:09:28,239
Well, maybe we better
just forget the whole thing.

140
00:09:28,573 --> 00:09:29,498
No.

141
00:09:30,408 --> 00:09:33,244
I bet you like having your wiener sucked.

142
00:09:33,536 --> 00:09:34,379
Hmm?

143
00:09:34,579 --> 00:09:35,213
Don't you?

144
00:09:35,413 --> 00:09:37,039
Yeah, I guess so.

145
00:09:37,373 --> 00:09:40,668
How come that doesn't surprise me?

146
00:09:41,002 --> 00:09:44,005
What would a thing like that cost?

147
00:09:44,338 --> 00:09:45,264
$30.

148
00:09:49,093 --> 00:09:50,261
Sheriff's Department.

149
00:09:50,595 --> 00:09:52,013
You're under arrest.

150
00:09:55,641 --> 00:09:56,692
Let go!

151
00:10:01,188 --> 00:10:02,115
Come on guys.

152
00:10:02,315 --> 00:10:02,949
I didn't do anything.

153
00:10:03,149 --> 00:10:03,991
I did nothing wrong.

154
00:10:04,191 --> 00:10:05,276
Take it easy.

155
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:06,202
Come on.

156
00:10:06,402 --> 00:10:09,030
Where do you think you're going?

157
00:10:09,363 --> 00:10:10,323
Ow!

158
00:10:10,656 --> 00:10:11,290
Ow!

159
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:12,125
You're hurting me.

160
00:10:12,325 --> 00:10:13,826
You're hurting my arm.

161
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,086
You're hurting me.

162
00:10:15,286 --> 00:10:16,495
You're hurting my arm.

163
00:10:16,829 --> 00:10:17,463
Ow!

164
00:10:17,663 --> 00:10:18,664
What's your name, miss?

165
00:10:18,998 --> 00:10:20,333
Ramona Lutz.

166
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:21,592
Bully.

167
00:10:24,587 --> 00:10:25,555
Are you staying at this motel?

168
00:10:25,755 --> 00:10:26,680
Yeah.

169
00:10:29,091 --> 00:10:31,135
I never saw that before in my life,

170
00:10:31,469 --> 00:10:33,095
and that's the God's truth, sir.

171
00:10:33,429 --> 00:10:36,182
You telling me this brown
residue isn't narcotics?

172
00:10:36,515 --> 00:10:37,558
It doesn't belong to me.

173
00:10:37,892 --> 00:10:38,568
What is that?

174
00:10:38,768 --> 00:10:39,402
Speed?

175
00:10:39,602 --> 00:10:40,236
You look like a speedy kind of gal.

176
00:10:40,436 --> 00:10:41,395
Oh, come on officer, please.

177
00:10:41,729 --> 00:10:43,773
Listen to me, please.

178
00:10:44,106 --> 00:10:46,942
My little girl's home with
me now, and she just got out

179
00:10:47,276 --> 00:10:48,819
of Children's Services.

180
00:10:49,153 --> 00:10:50,571
I can't afford to be busted again

181
00:10:50,905 --> 00:10:52,073
because they'll take her away from me.

182
00:10:52,406 --> 00:10:53,699
They'll just take my baby.

183
00:10:54,033 --> 00:10:56,619
You know this pipe
constitutes probable cause?

184
00:10:56,952 --> 00:10:58,704
We're going to have to take a
look inside your motel room.

185
00:10:59,038 --> 00:11:00,247
You can't do that.

186
00:11:00,581 --> 00:11:02,041
My husband's asleep.

187
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:04,752
Your husband know you're
out here soliciting?

188
00:11:05,086 --> 00:11:06,420
Oh, give us a fucking break.

189
00:11:06,754 --> 00:11:08,005
Your husband own a firearm, Ramona?

190
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:10,424
My Larry is on parole.

191
00:11:10,758 --> 00:11:13,594
He hasn't had a firearm for a long time.

192
00:11:13,928 --> 00:11:14,929
We're going to be real
unhappy if you're not

193
00:11:15,262 --> 00:11:16,430
telling us the truth Ramona.

194
00:11:16,764 --> 00:11:18,474
I am telling you the truth.

195
00:11:18,808 --> 00:11:19,484
Okay, come on.

196
00:11:19,684 --> 00:11:20,935
Let's go.

197
00:11:21,268 --> 00:11:23,688
You guys are making me wish I was dead.

198
00:11:24,021 --> 00:11:27,858
You fucking,

199
00:11:28,192 --> 00:11:29,202
You're going to cut that out right now

200
00:11:29,402 --> 00:11:30,528
or you're going to be hogtied.

201
00:11:30,861 --> 00:11:31,496
Just listen to me.

202
00:11:31,696 --> 00:11:33,322
Shut your mouth now.

203
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,574
Not another word.

204
00:11:41,789 --> 00:11:43,749
Please don't take my baby away.

205
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:46,043
Sheriff's Department Larry.

206
00:11:46,377 --> 00:11:47,302
Oh yes.

207
00:11:48,003 --> 00:11:50,631
We need to talk to you a minute.

208
00:11:50,965 --> 00:11:52,758
Hey, hey what the fuck?

209
00:11:53,092 --> 00:11:54,018
Oh shit.

210
00:11:54,844 --> 00:11:58,139
- Who's the girl Larry?
- Don't take my baby away.

211
00:11:58,472 --> 00:12:00,057
You diddling the daughter Larry?

212
00:12:00,391 --> 00:12:01,892
What kind of question is that?

213
00:12:02,226 --> 00:12:04,061
Get her out of here!

214
00:12:04,395 --> 00:12:05,029
Hey, hey, hey.

215
00:12:05,229 --> 00:12:05,863
Come on now.

216
00:12:06,063 --> 00:12:09,150
She ain't my real daughter,
and besides nothing's going on.

217
00:12:09,483 --> 00:12:10,117
Right?

218
00:12:10,317 --> 00:12:10,952
Ow, ow!

219
00:12:11,152 --> 00:12:12,069
Just who is this man to you?

220
00:12:12,403 --> 00:12:13,612
He's my stepfather.

221
00:12:13,946 --> 00:12:15,197
Take him into the
other room, and I'll talk

222
00:12:15,531 --> 00:12:16,207
to the juvenile alone.

223
00:12:16,407 --> 00:12:17,041
Ow!

224
00:12:17,241 --> 00:12:18,251
I got a pin in my shoulder,
and if you don't cuff

225
00:12:18,451 --> 00:12:20,035
me in front I swear to God
I'm going to sue the fucking

226
00:12:20,369 --> 00:12:23,080
police department until
there's no fucking tomorrow.

227
00:12:23,414 --> 00:12:24,331
You son of a bitch!

228
00:12:24,665 --> 00:12:25,299
Ow!

229
00:12:25,499 --> 00:12:27,293
What's your name, miss?

230
00:12:27,626 --> 00:12:29,336
Vanessa Lutz.

231
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:31,714
Well kid, I sure
don't envy your situation here.

232
00:12:32,047 --> 00:12:34,216
My parents is just going
through a hard time is all,

233
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:36,343
with the finances and everything.

234
00:12:36,677 --> 00:12:38,012
I see they got enough money

235
00:12:38,345 --> 00:12:39,889
left over to buy drugs.

236
00:12:40,222 --> 00:12:41,932
I wouldn't be comfortable talking about

237
00:12:42,266 --> 00:12:44,226
that sort of thing, ma'am.

238
00:12:47,313 --> 00:12:48,647
I'm going to ask you a question, okay?

239
00:12:48,981 --> 00:12:49,899
Don't get upset either.

240
00:12:50,232 --> 00:12:51,275
It's important.

241
00:12:51,609 --> 00:12:52,534
Okay.

242
00:12:53,611 --> 00:12:55,571
Is there some sort of
sexual activity going on

243
00:12:55,905 --> 00:12:58,449
between your stepfather and yourself?

244
00:12:59,867 --> 00:13:03,287
Elevator up!

245
00:13:04,371 --> 00:13:06,290
We are so fucked.

246
00:13:06,624 --> 00:13:08,000
What are you laughing at?

247
00:13:08,334 --> 00:13:09,710
We are so fucked.

248
00:13:11,086 --> 00:13:12,963
Don't take my baby away.

249
00:13:13,297 --> 00:13:13,973
Oh, please!

250
00:13:14,173 --> 00:13:15,424
If you love her so much
how come you don't clean up

251
00:13:15,758 --> 00:13:17,468
around here once in a while?

252
00:13:17,802 --> 00:13:19,386
I do clean up, sir.

253
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,639
It just happens that I'm
under a great deal of stress.

254
00:13:21,972 --> 00:13:24,141
My sister happened to die
three months ago in Washington,

255
00:13:24,475 --> 00:13:26,769
and I'm trying to get off methadone.

256
00:13:27,102 --> 00:13:29,021
- You're on methadone?
- Will you please

257
00:13:29,355 --> 00:13:30,523
give me a cigarette?

258
00:13:30,856 --> 00:13:31,899
I told you to keep quiet.

259
00:13:32,233 --> 00:13:33,692
Please give her a cigarette.

260
00:13:34,026 --> 00:13:35,027
Please.

261
00:13:35,361 --> 00:13:36,570
Are you mad at me?

262
00:13:36,904 --> 00:13:37,830
Honey?

263
00:13:38,614 --> 00:13:40,699
I'm not mad, Mom.

264
00:13:41,033 --> 00:13:42,034
Please, don't be mad.

265
00:13:42,368 --> 00:13:43,536
Come over here, give me a big hug.

266
00:13:43,869 --> 00:13:44,629
Come on.

267
00:13:44,829 --> 00:13:47,957
I ain't going to see you
for a long time, baby.

268
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:49,216
Come on.

269
00:13:51,377 --> 00:13:52,427
Ah, baby.

270
00:13:54,129 --> 00:13:56,340
I am so sorry, pooh bear.

271
00:13:56,674 --> 00:13:57,850
I'm so sorry.

272
00:14:00,845 --> 00:14:02,930
You still love me?

273
00:14:03,264 --> 00:14:04,265
I love you Momma.

274
00:14:04,598 --> 00:14:05,891
I love you more.

275
00:14:13,816 --> 00:14:14,825
I love you.

276
00:14:21,532 --> 00:14:22,208
Ow!

277
00:14:22,408 --> 00:14:24,869
Okay, just tell this piece of shit to get

278
00:14:25,202 --> 00:14:26,662
his knee out of my neck.

279
00:14:26,996 --> 00:14:29,498
Bye Ramona!

280
00:14:29,832 --> 00:14:31,125
I love you, honey.

281
00:14:32,334 --> 00:14:33,335
I love you.

282
00:14:35,337 --> 00:14:36,097
Ow!

283
00:14:36,297 --> 00:14:36,931
Ow!

284
00:14:37,131 --> 00:14:38,674
Ow!
- Watch her head.

285
00:14:40,926 --> 00:14:41,686
I'll go in the other car.

286
00:14:43,262 --> 00:14:44,889
Get her out of here.

287
00:14:45,222 --> 00:14:47,308
Bye, Ramona!

288
00:14:47,641 --> 00:14:49,518
Children's Services are on their way.

289
00:14:49,852 --> 00:14:51,145
Oh, that's just great.

290
00:14:51,478 --> 00:14:52,980
No offense kid, but
anything's an improvement

291
00:14:53,314 --> 00:14:54,239
over this.

292
00:14:57,526 --> 00:14:58,652
What do you think we ought to do with you?

293
00:14:58,986 --> 00:15:00,446
Just leave you here?

294
00:15:03,824 --> 00:15:06,243
I could stay with you
for a couple of weeks.

295
00:15:06,577 --> 00:15:07,503
Are you kidding?

296
00:15:07,703 --> 00:15:08,546
No, I'm serious.

297
00:15:08,746 --> 00:15:09,747
I mean I can do all sorts of chores

298
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,415
while you was out messing people up.

299
00:15:11,749 --> 00:15:13,876
We're not allowed to
do things like that.

300
00:15:16,587 --> 00:15:18,047
You're lying.

301
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,056
No, I'm not.

302
00:15:19,256 --> 00:15:19,890
Yeah, you are.

303
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:21,258
If you don't want to, all you had to do

304
00:15:21,592 --> 00:15:23,594
was just say it straight out.

305
00:15:23,928 --> 00:15:25,220
I don't want to.

306
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,141
Okay, then.

307
00:15:42,488 --> 00:15:43,822
Hey, Mrs. Sheets.

308
00:15:44,156 --> 00:15:45,074
I guess you heard the news.

309
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,041
Hello Vanessa.

310
00:15:46,241 --> 00:15:48,327
I heard you mother might
be away for a while.

311
00:15:48,661 --> 00:15:50,412
Yeah, it's her third arrest this year.

312
00:15:50,746 --> 00:15:52,498
She's looking at six months mandatory.

313
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:54,083
We're holding her stepfather

314
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:55,584
on multiple parole violations.

315
00:15:55,918 --> 00:15:58,879
Oh, I am so sorry
about all this, Vanessa.

316
00:15:59,213 --> 00:16:00,965
I can take over here now, officer.

317
00:16:01,298 --> 00:16:02,383
Good luck, kid.

318
00:16:02,716 --> 00:16:03,350
Yeah, right.

319
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:06,470
Come on over and ruin
my life again real soon.

320
00:16:06,804 --> 00:16:08,138
You don't have to be
so hard on the officer.

321
00:16:08,472 --> 00:16:12,434
She just took my whole
family off to jail, okay?

322
00:16:16,271 --> 00:16:19,441
Gosh, I hate pigs so much, Mrs. Sheets.

323
00:16:22,653 --> 00:16:23,654
Well, come on, now.

324
00:16:23,988 --> 00:16:26,782
Let's go gather up some of your things.

325
00:16:27,116 --> 00:16:29,493
You're putting me in foster
care again, aren't you?

326
00:16:29,827 --> 00:16:31,996
Honey, I'm willing to
consider any alternative you'd

327
00:16:32,329 --> 00:16:34,456
like to suggest, but I don't know.

328
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:37,001
My Grandma would be an alternative.

329
00:16:37,334 --> 00:16:39,378
This is the first I've
heard of any grandma.

330
00:16:39,712 --> 00:16:41,088
Yeah, on my father's side.

331
00:16:41,422 --> 00:16:42,631
My real father.

332
00:16:42,965 --> 00:16:44,008
See?

333
00:16:44,341 --> 00:16:46,468
She'd take me in, most likely.

334
00:16:46,802 --> 00:16:48,846
You don't sound too sure.

335
00:16:49,179 --> 00:16:51,598
Actually, she don't know about me yet.

336
00:16:51,932 --> 00:16:56,061
That's not going to do
us much good for tonight.

337
00:16:56,395 --> 00:16:58,355
Why haven't you been in
touch with her before now?

338
00:16:58,689 --> 00:17:00,816
Because before I was born
there was this bad blood

339
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:03,360
between her and my mom, and
there must have been some harsh

340
00:17:03,694 --> 00:17:05,529
words spoke because my mom was supposed

341
00:17:05,863 --> 00:17:06,831
to have thrown this chemical

342
00:17:07,031 --> 00:17:09,700
in her face that burned
her skin a little bit.

343
00:17:10,034 --> 00:17:11,118
Lovely.

344
00:17:11,452 --> 00:17:12,661
I tried to get her on the phone once,

345
00:17:12,995 --> 00:17:14,038
but she ain't listed.

346
00:17:14,371 --> 00:17:15,172
If I could just get up

347
00:17:15,372 --> 00:17:17,624
to that Stockton place,
I know I'd find her.

348
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:18,843
Just like that, huh?

349
00:17:19,043 --> 00:17:19,968
Yeah.

350
00:17:20,836 --> 00:17:22,337
Vanessa, Vanessa.

351
00:17:23,422 --> 00:17:24,556
Oh, my God.

352
00:17:25,841 --> 00:17:28,177
I know what I need.

353
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:31,972
Mrs. Sheets, could you come in
here and fold up my blanket?

354
00:17:32,306 --> 00:17:34,683
- This one?
- Yeah, that one.

355
00:17:35,017 --> 00:17:36,268
What in the world do you
want with this old thing.

356
00:17:36,602 --> 00:17:37,686
Oh, you know, my momma gave it to me.

357
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:38,937
What are you doing?

358
00:17:39,271 --> 00:17:40,197
Oh!

359
00:17:40,397 --> 00:17:41,031
Oh!

360
00:17:41,231 --> 00:17:42,357
Oh, oh!

361
00:17:42,691 --> 00:17:43,325
Shit!

362
00:17:43,525 --> 00:17:44,985
Sorry let me get you turned around.

363
00:17:45,319 --> 00:17:47,821
Vanessa, this is not funny.

364
00:17:48,155 --> 00:17:49,081
Vanessa!

365
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,866
I'm not laughing Mrs. Sheets.

366
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:51,834
I promise.

367
00:17:52,034 --> 00:17:55,788
If you yell loud enough, Mr.
Wong will come set you free.

368
00:17:56,121 --> 00:17:57,047
He's the day manager.

369
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:58,874
And I'll leave the keys on top of the TV.

370
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:00,217
Vanessa, don't do this!

371
00:18:00,417 --> 00:18:01,385
You come back here!

372
00:18:01,585 --> 00:18:02,511
Vanessa!

373
00:18:36,537 --> 00:18:39,289
Where the fuck are you, Chopper?

374
00:18:42,084 --> 00:18:43,210
Who wants some of this shit?

375
00:18:44,628 --> 00:18:46,880
Go get some fucking Doritos, bitch.

376
00:18:47,214 --> 00:18:48,715
Get the fuck out of here.

377
00:18:53,762 --> 00:18:54,813
Chopper!

378
00:18:57,015 --> 00:18:58,267
Chopper, we're fucked.

379
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,768
We're totally fucked.

380
00:19:00,102 --> 00:19:01,270
Just after you left, the
pigs came and pinched

381
00:19:01,603 --> 00:19:02,521
mom and Larry both.

382
00:19:02,855 --> 00:19:04,106
And my parole officer showed up

383
00:19:04,439 --> 00:19:07,609
like a motherfucking plague to
take me to foster care again.

384
00:19:07,943 --> 00:19:09,403
Just like last time.

385
00:19:12,447 --> 00:19:14,950
So, how did you get here?

386
00:19:15,284 --> 00:19:17,828
I cuffed her ankle to the bed.

387
00:19:18,162 --> 00:19:19,454
That wasn't very smart, Vanessa.

388
00:19:19,788 --> 00:19:20,464
I know.

389
00:19:20,664 --> 00:19:21,832
I know.

390
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:22,883
Look, I'm going up north.

391
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:24,376
Unless you never want to see me again,

392
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:26,128
you better get in this car
right now and come with me.

393
00:19:26,461 --> 00:19:29,464
I got to be in court
next week for sentencing.

394
00:19:29,798 --> 00:19:34,428
If I don't show I'll get a
year at Camp Gonzales for sure.

395
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:38,348
I guess I'm on my own.

396
00:19:39,433 --> 00:19:41,059
Where up north are you going?

397
00:19:41,393 --> 00:19:44,146
My grandma is up in Stockton.

398
00:19:44,479 --> 00:19:45,814
You got any money?

399
00:19:46,148 --> 00:19:47,073
No.

400
00:19:55,574 --> 00:19:58,160
Sell that when you
get where you're going.

401
00:19:58,493 --> 00:19:59,620
It's from Spain.

402
00:20:03,415 --> 00:20:04,958
I love you so much, Chopper.

403
00:20:05,292 --> 00:20:07,002
I love you too, baby.

404
00:20:28,106 --> 00:20:31,568
Oh, here, take this.

405
00:20:38,992 --> 00:20:40,126
I gotta go.

406
00:20:58,387 --> 00:21:02,057
Bye Chopper, my beloved boyfriend.

407
00:21:19,283 --> 00:21:20,951
Hey, pinche mayate!

408
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,444
Fucking car!

409
00:22:39,446 --> 00:22:42,407
my ass.

410
00:22:47,537 --> 00:22:48,588
Fuck.

411
00:23:10,143 --> 00:23:11,520
You having some kind of trouble?

412
00:23:11,853 --> 00:23:13,063
Yeah, the fucking cocksucker won't

413
00:23:13,397 --> 00:23:15,107
even fucking turn over.

414
00:23:16,316 --> 00:23:19,361
Excuse my bad language, sir.

415
00:23:19,694 --> 00:23:20,370
It's all right.

416
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:21,947
Mind if I take a look at it?

417
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,323
Yeah, go for it.

418
00:23:23,657 --> 00:23:24,699
Why don't you get behind the wheel there

419
00:23:25,033 --> 00:23:27,077
and step on the gas for me.

420
00:23:31,206 --> 00:23:32,257
Try it.

421
00:23:36,503 --> 00:23:37,471
Again.

422
00:23:44,386 --> 00:23:46,430
Well, I hate to be the one
to break the news to you,

423
00:23:46,763 --> 00:23:48,223
but this car has had it.

424
00:23:48,557 --> 00:23:50,100
I knew it was only a matter of time.

425
00:23:50,434 --> 00:23:51,401
Where you headed?

426
00:23:51,601 --> 00:23:53,353
My grandma is up in Stockton.

427
00:23:53,687 --> 00:23:55,105
Well, I'm going as far as LA.

428
00:23:55,439 --> 00:23:57,190
You're more than welcome to
ride with me if you like.

429
00:23:57,524 --> 00:23:58,200
Really, mister?

430
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,034
Sure.

431
00:23:59,234 --> 00:24:00,569
Why don't you grab your
stuff and let's go.

432
00:24:00,902 --> 00:24:01,828
Thanks!

433
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,683
I guess we ought to
call a tow truck, huh?

434
00:24:32,017 --> 00:24:33,560
Nah, Cal Trans will take care of it.

435
00:24:33,894 --> 00:24:36,229
I know my mom used to
work part time for them.

436
00:24:36,563 --> 00:24:37,939
So, what do I call you?

437
00:24:38,273 --> 00:24:38,949
I'm sorry.

438
00:24:39,149 --> 00:24:40,075
My name is Bob Wolverton.

439
00:24:40,275 --> 00:24:41,318
Hi, I'm Vanessa Lutz.

440
00:24:41,651 --> 00:24:42,819
Nice to meet you, Vanessa.

441
00:24:43,153 --> 00:24:46,198
Why don't you put on your
safety belt and we'll get going.

442
00:24:50,035 --> 00:24:51,085
Great.

443
00:25:00,337 --> 00:25:02,088
What's this all about?

444
00:25:02,422 --> 00:25:04,883
It's a psychological
manual I use at my work.

445
00:25:05,217 --> 00:25:08,512
I'm a counselor at a school for
boys with emotional trouble.

446
00:25:08,845 --> 00:25:09,888
Just boys, huh?

447
00:25:10,222 --> 00:25:11,348
No girls at all?

448
00:25:11,681 --> 00:25:12,807
I'm afraid so.

449
00:25:16,353 --> 00:25:17,237
So, how does your family feel about

450
00:25:17,437 --> 00:25:19,064
this trip of yours up to Stockton?

451
00:25:19,397 --> 00:25:22,067
I don't got no family
just at the moment.

452
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,320
Vanessa, everybody's got family.

453
00:25:25,654 --> 00:25:27,614
Shows how much you know.

454
00:25:28,907 --> 00:25:29,991
You want to talk about it?

455
00:25:30,325 --> 00:25:31,501
Not really.

456
00:25:32,327 --> 00:25:33,370
I'm sorry.

457
00:25:33,703 --> 00:25:35,288
It's an unfortunate habit of mine,

458
00:25:35,622 --> 00:25:37,624
sticking my nose in where
it doesn't really belong.

459
00:25:37,958 --> 00:25:40,001
That's a bad habit.

460
00:25:40,335 --> 00:25:41,545
Well, don't rub it in okay?

461
00:25:41,878 --> 00:25:42,921
It's just my work.

462
00:25:43,255 --> 00:25:45,215
I see a kid who looks
like they're in trouble

463
00:25:45,549 --> 00:25:47,259
and I start asking all kinds of questions.

464
00:25:47,592 --> 00:25:50,220
I guess it's just become second nature.

465
00:25:50,554 --> 00:25:52,472
It's that obvious?

466
00:25:52,806 --> 00:25:53,690
What is?

467
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:55,392
Me being in trouble.

468
00:25:55,725 --> 00:25:59,354
Look, the offer's still
open if you want it.

469
00:26:00,522 --> 00:26:04,067
You know, I've always found it
amazing how, how much easier

470
00:26:04,401 --> 00:26:06,444
it is to really share something
with a perfect stranger.

471
00:26:06,778 --> 00:26:08,113
Stuff that you couldn't even talk to with

472
00:26:08,446 --> 00:26:09,531
your best friend or your family.

473
00:26:09,864 --> 00:26:11,032
Yeah, I noticed that.

474
00:26:11,366 --> 00:26:12,325
That's real funny, isn't it?

475
00:26:12,659 --> 00:26:13,418
Yeah, it is.

476
00:26:13,618 --> 00:26:14,786
Most of the kids I work
with, I don't even have

477
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,454
to press them to talk about themselves.

478
00:26:16,788 --> 00:26:19,541
I just let them know I'm there
and that they can talk about

479
00:26:19,874 --> 00:26:21,918
themselves if they want to.

480
00:26:25,088 --> 00:26:28,091
Well, I guess my biggest problem

481
00:26:28,425 --> 00:26:31,720
right now is, my mamma is in jail.

482
00:26:33,179 --> 00:26:36,266
Vanessa, that sounds like
a pretty bad situation.

483
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:40,312
Yeah, that's why I'm
going to see my grandma.

484
00:26:41,229 --> 00:26:44,983
You mind me asking why
your mother's in jail?

485
00:26:45,317 --> 00:26:46,526
It's pretty embarrassing.

486
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:47,861
Vanessa, why would you be embarrassed

487
00:26:48,194 --> 00:26:49,162
about another person's acts?

488
00:26:49,362 --> 00:26:50,038
I don't know.

489
00:26:50,238 --> 00:26:51,281
It's just,

490
00:26:51,615 --> 00:26:54,284
I don't feel comfortable
talking about stuff like that.

491
00:26:54,618 --> 00:26:58,830
I think it makes me look
like a low-type person.

492
00:26:59,831 --> 00:27:01,875
I can understand that.

493
00:27:02,208 --> 00:27:03,418
You know, most of the boys I work with,

494
00:27:03,752 --> 00:27:05,795
even the most troubled ones,

495
00:27:06,129 --> 00:27:09,758
all they really need is just
someone to listen to them.

496
00:27:10,091 --> 00:27:11,676
Yeah, but you probably
get so sick of hearing

497
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:14,804
them sad stories day in and day out.

498
00:27:15,138 --> 00:27:16,022
I don't.

499
00:27:16,222 --> 00:27:17,349
I really love my work.

500
00:27:17,682 --> 00:27:18,483
I really do.

501
00:27:18,683 --> 00:27:20,310
I couldn't imagine myself
doing anything else.

502
00:27:20,644 --> 00:27:21,569
Not ever.

503
00:27:27,609 --> 00:27:31,237
I guess I wouldn't
mind talking to someone.

504
00:27:32,405 --> 00:27:35,158
Just wouldn't know where to begin.

505
00:27:36,076 --> 00:27:37,619
Why don't you begin with your mother.

506
00:27:37,952 --> 00:27:39,663
I mean, if you want to.

507
00:27:41,831 --> 00:27:45,669
My mamma's a whore.

508
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,468
Thanks, mister.

509
00:27:54,928 --> 00:27:55,845
I mean, Bob.

510
00:27:57,472 --> 00:27:58,523
There.

511
00:28:00,308 --> 00:28:04,312
I can't believe I'm
telling you all this stuff.

512
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:07,232
My mamma's in jail.

513
00:28:08,316 --> 00:28:10,485
It looks like my stepfather's
next parole officer

514
00:28:10,819 --> 00:28:12,696
ain't even been born yet.

515
00:28:14,239 --> 00:28:18,159
Vanessa, you really
don't have anyone, do you?

516
00:28:22,789 --> 00:28:24,040
That's terrible.

517
00:28:25,208 --> 00:28:27,877
Oh, that's just terrible.

518
00:28:28,211 --> 00:28:30,839
My real dad was this
merchant Marine out in Texas,

519
00:28:31,172 --> 00:28:33,758
but he got stabbed to death
on one of them container ships

520
00:28:34,092 --> 00:28:38,096
by this man from Pakistan,
before I was born.

521
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:39,064
You want to see his picture?

522
00:28:39,264 --> 00:28:41,891
I got it right here.
- Absolutely.

523
00:28:44,769 --> 00:28:46,187
That's my daddy.

524
00:28:49,816 --> 00:28:51,151
He looks very interesting.

525
00:28:51,484 --> 00:28:53,987
- You think?
- Absolutely.

526
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,905
I think so, too.

527
00:28:56,239 --> 00:28:58,116
Vanessa, your grandmother
is going to be very proud when

528
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:01,578
she finds out what a wonderful
granddaughter she's got.

529
00:29:01,911 --> 00:29:03,997
But I have to be honest with you.

530
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:06,082
I think given your present situation,

531
00:29:06,416 --> 00:29:09,377
maybe foster care would be the
way you should go right now.

532
00:29:09,711 --> 00:29:10,345
Oh Bob.

533
00:29:10,545 --> 00:29:11,471
You don't know.

534
00:29:11,671 --> 00:29:13,256
You know, sometimes them places are okay.

535
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:14,474
But most of the time,

536
00:29:14,674 --> 00:29:15,642
them people are just in it for the check

537
00:29:15,842 --> 00:29:17,510
that the state sends for your upkeep.

538
00:29:17,844 --> 00:29:19,804
I take it you've had
some bad experiences?

539
00:29:20,138 --> 00:29:22,056
The last one I was in,
there was this old man there

540
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:25,435
that everyone called Grandpa
and he had this disease called

541
00:29:25,769 --> 00:29:27,395
"Wiesenheimer's", I think it was,

542
00:29:27,729 --> 00:29:31,274
where your brain cells
run out into your pee.

543
00:29:33,485 --> 00:29:34,652
Yes, it's a form of senility.

544
00:29:34,986 --> 00:29:37,363
- Here's your check sir.
- Thank you.

545
00:29:37,697 --> 00:29:38,540
Thanks, Bob.

546
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:42,702
That's the best fucking
dinner I've had all month.

547
00:29:44,245 --> 00:29:45,663
Wouldn't mind stretching
my legs for a little while

548
00:29:45,997 --> 00:29:46,881
before I got behind the wheel.

549
00:29:47,081 --> 00:29:47,966
Do you mind?

550
00:29:48,166 --> 00:29:50,335
No, sure.

551
00:29:50,668 --> 00:29:52,504
I got all the time in the world.

552
00:29:52,837 --> 00:29:53,763
Great.

553
00:29:54,422 --> 00:29:56,966
So, them foster parents, the Morales,

554
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:57,976
I mean you would have

555
00:29:58,176 --> 00:29:59,886
thought a check from the state
would've been enough, but no.

556
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:02,472
They figured on me helping
out with Grandpa, too.

557
00:30:02,806 --> 00:30:04,849
You mean, you actually had
to provide care for this man?

558
00:30:05,183 --> 00:30:05,817
Get crucial.

559
00:30:06,017 --> 00:30:08,394
This guy was pissing his
sheets nearly every night.

560
00:30:08,728 --> 00:30:11,940
Just being near him made me
want to puke my guts out.

561
00:30:12,273 --> 00:30:14,400
So, what happened when you refused?

562
00:30:14,734 --> 00:30:15,902
They just started treating me

563
00:30:16,236 --> 00:30:18,738
like I was the biggest
bitch who'd ever been born.

564
00:30:19,072 --> 00:30:21,074
And this one night, just
a couple of weeks after

565
00:30:21,407 --> 00:30:23,618
I'd been placed there,
I woke up to see Grandpa

566
00:30:23,952 --> 00:30:25,870
standing over me with his cane in one hand

567
00:30:26,204 --> 00:30:28,414
and his you know what in the other.

568
00:30:28,748 --> 00:30:29,382
My God!

569
00:30:29,582 --> 00:30:30,342
What happened?

570
00:30:30,542 --> 00:30:32,418
I told him to get the hell out.

571
00:30:32,752 --> 00:30:34,087
I take it he didn't.

572
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:35,797
Nah, that's when he tried to slip in

573
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:37,298
in under the covers with me.

574
00:30:37,632 --> 00:30:39,968
I just went crazy on him.

575
00:30:40,301 --> 00:30:42,679
What do you mean, you went crazy?

576
00:30:43,012 --> 00:30:44,764
I was pissed off because
I couldn't see my mom

577
00:30:45,098 --> 00:30:46,516
and just having this perv standing over me

578
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:50,019
wagging his thing in my face
was just like the last straw.

579
00:30:50,353 --> 00:30:52,272
So what did you do?

580
00:30:52,605 --> 00:30:55,358
Well, got up on my knees and just

581
00:30:55,692 --> 00:30:58,278
slapped his dentures half out of his face.

582
00:30:58,611 --> 00:30:59,612
Then I dropped down on his chest

583
00:30:59,946 --> 00:31:01,531
and just started wailing on him,

584
00:31:01,865 --> 00:31:03,533
beating him up so hard.

585
00:31:03,867 --> 00:31:05,368
Swearing so loud.

586
00:31:05,702 --> 00:31:06,870
My God.

587
00:31:07,203 --> 00:31:07,837
Yeah.

588
00:31:08,037 --> 00:31:09,163
So then, the lights
went on and Mr. Morales

589
00:31:09,497 --> 00:31:10,582
showed up in his pajamas.

590
00:31:10,915 --> 00:31:12,500
Well, thank God he was there.

591
00:31:12,834 --> 00:31:14,043
Yeah, right.

592
00:31:14,377 --> 00:31:16,212
He hit me so hard I had
to have my jaw wired shut

593
00:31:16,546 --> 00:31:18,590
for nearly three months.

594
00:31:18,923 --> 00:31:20,008
Broke my nose too.

595
00:31:20,341 --> 00:31:22,510
That's how come it's so big.

596
00:31:22,844 --> 00:31:25,305
Vanessa, your nose is not big.

597
00:31:29,517 --> 00:31:31,352
It's pretty damn big.

598
00:31:34,105 --> 00:31:36,399
Was this man ever punished?

599
00:31:36,733 --> 00:31:37,742
Are you kidding?

600
00:31:37,942 --> 00:31:41,154
A pillar of society like Mr. Morales?

601
00:31:41,487 --> 00:31:42,414
Nah.

602
00:31:42,614 --> 00:31:44,324
But my mom got out of rehab
a couple of days later,

603
00:31:44,657 --> 00:31:46,951
so I didn't have to go back or nothing.

604
00:31:47,285 --> 00:31:48,745
You were telling me a while ago

605
00:31:49,078 --> 00:31:51,205
your step-dad was on parole.

606
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:53,458
Oh, yeah.

607
00:31:53,791 --> 00:31:55,627
Larry's been in lots of pens.

608
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:59,714
Like this one federal place
up in Illinois... Marion.

609
00:32:00,048 --> 00:32:02,216
It's mostly for drug shit.

610
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:06,846
Manufacturing methamphetamines,
stolen property.

611
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:08,890
Nothing real, real bad.

612
00:32:11,142 --> 00:32:14,938
Vanessa, please don't be
offended by my next question.

613
00:32:15,271 --> 00:32:17,106
But, um...

614
00:32:19,233 --> 00:32:21,277
Did your stepfather molest you?

615
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,281
Oh, my God.

616
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:30,119
You know, this lady police woman

617
00:32:30,453 --> 00:32:33,748
just asked me that very same
question just a few hours ago.

618
00:32:34,082 --> 00:32:36,751
And how did that make you feel?

619
00:32:37,085 --> 00:32:41,339
Like I got daddy's fuck
hole tattooed on my forehead.

620
00:32:41,673 --> 00:32:45,843
Maybe this is an issue
you should explore?

621
00:32:46,177 --> 00:32:49,138
I never even told my
fiancé about this stuff.

622
00:32:49,472 --> 00:32:50,356
Vanessa, if you keep something

623
00:32:50,556 --> 00:32:52,308
like this bottled up inside,

624
00:32:52,642 --> 00:32:55,019
it could wreck your whole life.

625
00:32:56,062 --> 00:32:57,480
Now you're scaring me.

626
00:32:57,814 --> 00:32:59,649
It's not my intention.

627
00:32:59,983 --> 00:33:01,776
I just think you have a
very good opportunity now

628
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:02,911
to get through

629
00:33:03,111 --> 00:33:04,320
some of the trauma and anguish
you've been suffering from

630
00:33:04,654 --> 00:33:06,197
for such a long time.

631
00:33:07,824 --> 00:33:09,701
I do got trauma, huh?

632
00:33:10,034 --> 00:33:12,745
Let's not kid ourselves, Vanessa.

633
00:33:14,706 --> 00:33:16,332
I've been so anguished,

634
00:33:16,666 --> 00:33:19,377
I can't even remember being happy.

635
00:33:19,711 --> 00:33:22,505
Vanessa, you have to
look this pain in the eye.

636
00:33:22,839 --> 00:33:26,634
Otherwise, it could rule over
every aspect of your life.

637
00:33:26,968 --> 00:33:29,053
Now, I think I can help you,

638
00:33:29,387 --> 00:33:32,265
but you're going to have to trust me.

639
00:33:33,224 --> 00:33:35,977
You're going to have to let me in.

640
00:33:40,106 --> 00:33:42,066
My God you're cold.

641
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:46,112
Just thinking about my
fucked up life is all.

642
00:33:53,411 --> 00:33:54,545
Let's go.

643
00:33:56,956 --> 00:33:59,125
I'm sorry.

644
00:33:59,459 --> 00:34:01,294
Here I'm blubbering like a big old baby,

645
00:34:01,627 --> 00:34:03,212
and you're just trying to help me.

646
00:34:03,546 --> 00:34:06,799
Vanessa, Vanessa, just take your time.

647
00:34:07,133 --> 00:34:08,176
Take your time.

648
00:34:17,226 --> 00:34:20,313
I was 11 when Larry first hit on me.

649
00:34:22,732 --> 00:34:24,567
Where was your mother?

650
00:34:24,901 --> 00:34:27,028
Some stupid halfway house.

651
00:34:30,156 --> 00:34:32,867
How did the abuse begin?

652
00:34:33,201 --> 00:34:35,369
With my mamma gone, I
had all these extra chores

653
00:34:35,703 --> 00:34:37,705
I had to do, like the laundry,

654
00:34:38,039 --> 00:34:39,832
the groceries and things like that.

655
00:34:40,166 --> 00:34:42,376
So, in effect you became
the woman of the house.

656
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:43,636
Yeah.

657
00:34:44,504 --> 00:34:45,671
Yeah.

658
00:34:46,005 --> 00:34:47,882
I was so proud of myself.

659
00:34:49,717 --> 00:34:52,762
And then this one night, we
was watching TV after dinner,

660
00:34:53,096 --> 00:34:56,891
like we always do, and
that's when Larry told me

661
00:34:57,934 --> 00:35:00,478
one of mamma's chores had always been

662
00:35:00,812 --> 00:35:03,022
to massage his you know what.

663
00:35:05,525 --> 00:35:08,069
Did Larry expose himself to you?

664
00:35:08,402 --> 00:35:10,113
All through the show.

665
00:35:11,405 --> 00:35:14,075
Did Larry have an erection?

666
00:35:14,408 --> 00:35:16,452
That's putting it mildly.

667
00:35:17,995 --> 00:35:21,415
Did he ask you to
perform oral sex for him?

668
00:35:21,749 --> 00:35:24,085
At first, I mean, he just had me hold on

669
00:35:24,418 --> 00:35:26,170
to his you know what

670
00:35:26,504 --> 00:35:29,173
during whatever happened to be on TV.

671
00:35:29,507 --> 00:35:32,385
He didn't get around to the
other thing you just mentioned

672
00:35:32,718 --> 00:35:33,811
for a while.

673
00:35:35,555 --> 00:35:37,849
I guess he figured if he went
all slow I wouldn't freak out

674
00:35:38,182 --> 00:35:39,892
and get him in trouble.

675
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:42,311
But back then I didn't know that stuff

676
00:35:42,645 --> 00:35:43,813
we was doing was criminal.

677
00:35:44,147 --> 00:35:45,898
Vanessa, victims often blame themselves.

678
00:35:46,232 --> 00:35:47,942
It's a common occurrence.

679
00:35:48,276 --> 00:35:49,485
Make no mistake about it.

680
00:35:49,819 --> 00:35:51,195
You are the victim.

681
00:35:52,655 --> 00:35:53,456
Really, Bob?

682
00:35:53,656 --> 00:35:54,832
Absolutely.

683
00:35:55,867 --> 00:35:57,702
I was such a baby back
then I didn't even know

684
00:35:58,035 --> 00:35:59,579
why men wanted all that stuff done to them

685
00:35:59,912 --> 00:36:00,713
in the first place.

686
00:36:00,913 --> 00:36:03,249
Vanessa, my God, you were a child.

687
00:36:03,583 --> 00:36:05,960
You must have been so confused.

688
00:36:07,628 --> 00:36:10,756
And when he did that
thing that you mentioned

689
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:15,011
for the first time, I swear to
Christ I thought he was going

690
00:36:15,344 --> 00:36:17,471
to the bathroom in my mouth.

691
00:36:23,311 --> 00:36:27,273
Vanessa, do I have your absolute trust?

692
00:36:28,816 --> 00:36:30,943
I guess I trust you more
than I've ever trusted anyone

693
00:36:31,277 --> 00:36:32,904
in my whole life, Bob.

694
00:36:33,863 --> 00:36:35,698
And I really mean that.

695
00:36:36,657 --> 00:36:37,617
Thank you.

696
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:40,244
The reason why I'm asking
is this very powerful new

697
00:36:40,578 --> 00:36:43,331
psychological technique
that I'd like to try on you.

698
00:36:43,664 --> 00:36:45,917
I think it could really help you.

699
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:46,926
What do you think?

700
00:36:47,126 --> 00:36:48,502
Would you like to give it a try?

701
00:36:48,836 --> 00:36:49,470
Yeah.

702
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:50,304
Sure.
- Okay.

703
00:36:50,504 --> 00:36:51,964
It consists of a battery of
questions that are designed

704
00:36:52,298 --> 00:36:55,259
to trigger certain elements
of your subconscious.

705
00:36:55,593 --> 00:36:57,094
I've got to warn you, Vanessa.

706
00:36:57,428 --> 00:37:00,556
This technique, it can be uncomfortable.

707
00:37:01,933 --> 00:37:03,059
Go for it, Bob.

708
00:37:03,392 --> 00:37:06,395
I mean, if you think
it's going to help me.

709
00:37:06,729 --> 00:37:07,863
Okay, okay.

710
00:37:09,607 --> 00:37:10,408
Let's get started.

711
00:37:10,608 --> 00:37:11,409
Are you ready?

712
00:37:11,609 --> 00:37:12,535
Mm-hmm.

713
00:37:13,402 --> 00:37:14,487
A few moments ago,
you were telling me that

714
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:17,365
you felt like Larry had gone
to the bathroom in your mouth.

715
00:37:17,698 --> 00:37:18,699
Those were your exact words.

716
00:37:19,033 --> 00:37:20,159
Do you remember?

717
00:37:23,454 --> 00:37:25,790
Now at that exact moment
when Larry ejaculated

718
00:37:26,123 --> 00:37:27,083
in your mouth,

719
00:37:28,542 --> 00:37:31,754
did you feel as though somehow
you were being transformed

720
00:37:32,088 --> 00:37:34,465
into some kind of a human urinal?

721
00:37:34,799 --> 00:37:36,133
What, are you fucking crazy?

722
00:37:36,467 --> 00:37:37,802
Vanessa, you just have to answer

723
00:37:38,135 --> 00:37:39,762
with the first thing that
comes into your mind.

724
00:37:40,096 --> 00:37:42,181
It's very very important.

725
00:37:42,515 --> 00:37:44,267
I knew I was flesh and blood.

726
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,060
I understand that,
but you have to tell me

727
00:37:46,394 --> 00:37:48,437
exactly how you felt.

728
00:37:48,771 --> 00:37:50,273
Vanessa, you have to learn how to express

729
00:37:50,606 --> 00:37:53,067
your feelings out loud.

730
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,572
I felt just like you said.

731
00:38:01,242 --> 00:38:03,327
Say it out loud, Vanessa.

732
00:38:06,622 --> 00:38:09,125
I felt like I had been...

733
00:38:10,418 --> 00:38:13,254
transformed into a human urinal.

734
00:38:14,964 --> 00:38:17,425
What made you feel like this?

735
00:38:23,681 --> 00:38:26,684
Having Larry ejaculate in my mouth.

736
00:38:35,276 --> 00:38:37,737
That's very good, Vanessa.

737
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:38,996
Very good.

738
00:38:40,323 --> 00:38:43,576
Now tell me this, and this
is absolutely crucial.

739
00:38:43,909 --> 00:38:45,536
Are you ready?

740
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:46,795
Mm-hmm.

741
00:38:49,582 --> 00:38:51,000
Vanessa...

742
00:38:52,126 --> 00:38:55,838
did Larry try to fuck you up the ass?

743
00:38:57,798 --> 00:38:59,050
Oh God.

744
00:38:59,383 --> 00:39:01,469
He tried, later on.

745
00:39:01,802 --> 00:39:02,728
Vanessa.

746
00:39:05,973 --> 00:39:09,393
Did you like it when Larry
fucked you up the ass?

747
00:39:13,022 --> 00:39:14,899
You piece of shit.

748
00:39:15,232 --> 00:39:17,443
Vanessa, I told you this
can get very uncomfortable.

749
00:39:17,777 --> 00:39:19,320
Pull over right now.

750
00:39:19,653 --> 00:39:20,663
We're not finished, yet.

751
00:39:20,863 --> 00:39:21,831
Oh yes, we are.

752
00:39:22,031 --> 00:39:22,915
We are definitely finished.

753
00:39:23,115 --> 00:39:24,041
Now you pull on over.

754
00:39:24,241 --> 00:39:25,785
Vanessa, you can
suffer irreparable damage

755
00:39:26,118 --> 00:39:27,453
if you break it off like this.

756
00:39:27,787 --> 00:39:28,829
I don't give a goddamn.

757
00:39:29,163 --> 00:39:30,373
Jesus Christ.

758
00:39:30,706 --> 00:39:31,424
- Shit.
- Bitch.

759
00:39:31,624 --> 00:39:34,293
- Fucking pervert.
- Jesus Christ.

760
00:39:34,627 --> 00:39:36,212
Where's the door handle?

761
00:39:36,545 --> 00:39:37,630
You looking for this?

762
00:39:39,423 --> 00:39:40,341
You just settle down.

763
00:39:40,674 --> 00:39:42,051
I'm going to kill you.

764
00:39:42,385 --> 00:39:43,352
I'm going to slit your
fucking throat right now.

765
00:39:43,552 --> 00:39:45,179
Is that what you want me to fucking do?

766
00:39:45,513 --> 00:39:46,147
Okay, okay.

767
00:39:46,347 --> 00:39:47,556
I'm stopping, okay?

768
00:39:47,890 --> 00:39:49,183
Now you get down there
on the floor and you get my

769
00:39:49,517 --> 00:39:53,020
fucking car keys and you
put them in the ignition.

770
00:39:54,105 --> 00:39:54,947
You wouldn't like it

771
00:39:55,147 --> 00:39:56,774
if someone was doing that to you.

772
00:39:57,108 --> 00:39:58,025
Well, you're probably right, Vanessa.

773
00:39:58,359 --> 00:40:00,194
I doubt I would like it if
someone was doing this to me.

774
00:40:00,528 --> 00:40:01,454
Well, then stop it.

775
00:40:01,654 --> 00:40:04,115
I will stop it
if you promise to behave.

776
00:40:04,448 --> 00:40:05,908
I promise I'll behave.

777
00:40:08,911 --> 00:40:11,956
Are you that guy on the news?

778
00:40:12,289 --> 00:40:13,374
I'm sorry?

779
00:40:13,707 --> 00:40:15,251
You the guy that's been
killing all them girls

780
00:40:15,584 --> 00:40:16,427
on the freeway, Bob?

781
00:40:18,963 --> 00:40:20,881
Why you killing all them girls, Bob?

782
00:40:21,215 --> 00:40:22,258
Because I've absolutely reached my

783
00:40:22,591 --> 00:40:24,385
fucking limit with
people like you, Vanessa.

784
00:40:24,718 --> 00:40:26,137
What kind of people am I supposed to be?

785
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:27,888
Alcoholics, drug addicts,

786
00:40:28,222 --> 00:40:29,765
fathers who fuck their daughters,

787
00:40:30,099 --> 00:40:32,601
the drug addicted motherfucking
whores with their bastards

788
00:40:32,935 --> 00:40:33,611
fucking offspring.

789
00:40:33,811 --> 00:40:35,354
Hey, I ain't no trick baby.

790
00:40:35,688 --> 00:40:39,400
Vanessa, I call them garbage
people, and I assure you

791
00:40:39,733 --> 00:40:40,860
you are one of them.

792
00:40:41,193 --> 00:40:42,528
- I am not.
- Look at you.

793
00:40:42,862 --> 00:40:45,197
You're already a master at
the manipulation of men.

794
00:40:45,531 --> 00:40:46,907
I didn't run nothing on you.

795
00:40:47,241 --> 00:40:48,534
It's so intrinsic to your fucking nature

796
00:40:48,868 --> 00:40:51,620
you are not even aware
of it when you do it.

797
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:55,716
Stupid bitch.

798
00:41:04,467 --> 00:41:05,968
So what, you think
it's okay to do all sorts

799
00:41:06,302 --> 00:41:07,386
of bad stuff to me now?

800
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,889
Well, that's an open-ended
discussion, Vanessa,

801
00:41:10,222 --> 00:41:12,099
dealing with deep
philosophical ramifications.

802
00:41:12,433 --> 00:41:14,393
Something you could hardly grasp.

803
00:41:14,727 --> 00:41:16,312
In fact, take it from me,
a professional, Vanessa,

804
00:41:16,645 --> 00:41:19,148
you're an absolute fucking moron.

805
00:41:19,482 --> 00:41:22,485
Maybe I ain't smart like
you, and maybe I haven't

806
00:41:22,818 --> 00:41:24,737
finished school, but at least
I ain't a fucking hypocrite.

807
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:27,823
Vanessa, please indulge me.

808
00:41:28,157 --> 00:41:31,243
Tell me why I am a hypocrite.

809
00:41:31,577 --> 00:41:33,871
You act like you's all
on some sort of mission,

810
00:41:34,205 --> 00:41:38,751
but all you want to do is just
get off in a sex type way.

811
00:41:40,836 --> 00:41:43,380
Are you going to do sex to me now?

812
00:41:43,714 --> 00:41:47,885
Vanessa, I promise you if
we get really, really intimate

813
00:41:48,219 --> 00:41:51,597
you're going to be way
past being offended.

814
00:41:53,057 --> 00:41:53,816
What?

815
00:41:54,016 --> 00:41:57,228
Are you going to fuck me when I'm dead?

816
00:41:58,646 --> 00:42:00,231
Mister, I'm a person.

817
00:42:00,564 --> 00:42:02,024
I'm a human being.

818
00:42:02,358 --> 00:42:04,151
Yeah, like that drug addict
fucking whore of a mother

819
00:42:04,485 --> 00:42:05,402
of yours?

820
00:42:05,736 --> 00:42:07,863
Well, I sure wouldn't
want to meet your mom, Bob.

821
00:42:10,866 --> 00:42:11,500
What?

822
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:12,993
You can talk about my mom,
but I can't talk about yours?

823
00:42:13,327 --> 00:42:15,996
We are not here to
talk about me, Vanessa.

824
00:42:16,330 --> 00:42:18,415
We are here to talk about you.

825
00:42:18,749 --> 00:42:20,501
So, get your fucking pants down

826
00:42:20,834 --> 00:42:23,796
and tell me how your father
used to fuck you in the mouth.

827
00:42:24,129 --> 00:42:25,339
Please, just let me go Bob.

828
00:42:25,673 --> 00:42:26,474
Goddammit!

829
00:42:27,508 --> 00:42:30,761
Get your fucking pants
down, you fucking cunt.

830
00:42:31,095 --> 00:42:32,721
What'd you call me?

831
00:42:33,055 --> 00:42:35,599
I called you a fucking cunt.

832
00:42:35,933 --> 00:42:37,184
Now get your fucking pants down,

833
00:42:37,518 --> 00:42:39,311
you dirty illiterate fucking cunt.

834
00:42:39,645 --> 00:42:40,688
Please, Bob.

835
00:42:41,021 --> 00:42:43,607
I said get your fucking pants down, now!

836
00:42:43,941 --> 00:42:45,025
Okay!

837
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:46,202
Okay!

838
00:42:46,402 --> 00:42:49,029
Look, I got these boots and I
got all them laces and stuff,

839
00:42:49,363 --> 00:42:50,698
so you're going to have
to give me a minute.

840
00:42:51,031 --> 00:42:52,040
Hurry up.

841
00:42:57,329 --> 00:42:58,338
Oh, fuck!

842
00:42:59,081 --> 00:43:00,749
Fucking bitch!

843
00:43:01,083 --> 00:43:03,252
I'm going to fucking kill you, Vanessa.

844
00:43:03,586 --> 00:43:05,045
You just settle down, Bob.

845
00:43:05,379 --> 00:43:06,013
Okay.

846
00:43:06,213 --> 00:43:07,181
You just settle down right now.

847
00:43:07,381 --> 00:43:08,224
Okay.

848
00:43:08,424 --> 00:43:10,384
Drop that razor out the window.

849
00:43:10,718 --> 00:43:15,264
If you try anything I'm going
to shoot you so many times.

850
00:43:16,599 --> 00:43:18,267
You know you should have
just let me out of the car

851
00:43:18,601 --> 00:43:20,728
when I asked you to, Bob.

852
00:43:21,061 --> 00:43:22,563
You see where bad manners get you?

853
00:43:22,896 --> 00:43:23,572
You see?

854
00:43:23,772 --> 00:43:25,899
Listen Vanessa, look I just-

855
00:43:26,233 --> 00:43:28,611
Look, I've heard all I'm
going to hear out of you.

856
00:43:28,944 --> 00:43:29,620
Ah, fuck.

857
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:30,913
So, there.

858
00:43:32,406 --> 00:43:33,332
Ah, Jesus Christ!

859
00:43:33,532 --> 00:43:34,450
And that's for tricking me

860
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:35,418
into telling you all them things

861
00:43:35,618 --> 00:43:37,745
I never even told my fiancé.

862
00:43:38,996 --> 00:43:41,332
Ah, Jesus Christ, we're
going to get into an accident!

863
00:43:41,665 --> 00:43:44,710
That's for cutting off
all my hair, you fucker.

864
00:43:45,044 --> 00:43:46,053
Vanessa, look, you're upset.

865
00:43:46,253 --> 00:43:46,887
Okay.

866
00:43:47,087 --> 00:43:47,888
You have every right to be.

867
00:43:48,088 --> 00:43:49,923
Look, something dark and
terrible came over me.

868
00:43:50,257 --> 00:43:51,300
I don't know what, but I
swear to you I wasn't going

869
00:43:51,634 --> 00:43:52,268
to hurt you.

870
00:43:52,468 --> 00:43:53,469
You've got to believe that.

871
00:43:53,802 --> 00:43:54,437
Oh, yeah right.

872
00:43:54,637 --> 00:43:55,271
I'm so sure.

873
00:43:55,471 --> 00:43:56,105
I'm serious.

874
00:43:56,305 --> 00:43:57,273
I just wanted to scare you.

875
00:43:57,473 --> 00:43:58,432
I don't even know why.

876
00:43:58,766 --> 00:44:03,145
Look, it's obvious to me now
I'm a profoundly sick man.

877
00:44:03,479 --> 00:44:05,356
Yeah, well I won't argue with you there.

878
00:44:05,689 --> 00:44:07,232
Anyone who'd do sex to a dead person

879
00:44:07,566 --> 00:44:09,652
is definitely sick, mister.

880
00:44:09,985 --> 00:44:10,911
Well, you see?

881
00:44:11,111 --> 00:44:11,787
You just admitted there.

882
00:44:11,987 --> 00:44:12,621
I'm a sick man.

883
00:44:12,821 --> 00:44:13,664
You can't hit a-
- Shut up!

884
00:44:13,864 --> 00:44:14,748
Shut up!

885
00:44:14,948 --> 00:44:16,325
Okay, okay, okay.

886
00:44:20,537 --> 00:44:21,705
Son of a bitch.

887
00:44:26,085 --> 00:44:29,380
Vanessa, what are you thinking right now?

888
00:44:29,713 --> 00:44:30,347
What?

889
00:44:30,547 --> 00:44:31,223
You want to hear more of my innermost

890
00:44:31,423 --> 00:44:32,424
fucking secrets?

891
00:44:32,758 --> 00:44:33,392
No.

892
00:44:33,592 --> 00:44:34,435
Fucking asshole.

893
00:44:34,635 --> 00:44:36,970
No, I was just wondering what
you were planning on doing.

894
00:44:37,304 --> 00:44:38,555
I'm going to turn you
in to the fucking pigs.

895
00:44:38,889 --> 00:44:41,016
That's what I'm going to do.

896
00:44:43,352 --> 00:44:47,147
Well, you know what will
happen then, don't you?

897
00:44:47,481 --> 00:44:50,984
Yeah, you'll end up
sucking gas at San Quentin.

898
00:44:51,318 --> 00:44:52,119
Vanessa-

899
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:53,529
You just might.

900
00:44:53,862 --> 00:44:58,075
Vanessa, people like me, we
don't go to the gas chamber.

901
00:44:58,409 --> 00:44:59,868
Then you'll go to the
penitentiary where the mighty

902
00:45:00,202 --> 00:45:02,913
Aryan brotherhood will make
you wish you'd never been born.

903
00:45:03,247 --> 00:45:04,540
Vanessa, the likelihood
of someone like me

904
00:45:04,873 --> 00:45:07,918
going to prison is absolutely nil.

905
00:45:08,252 --> 00:45:10,337
Well, you think they're
just going to let you walk?

906
00:45:10,671 --> 00:45:13,882
It will be like that time
Mr. Morales broke your jaw.

907
00:45:14,216 --> 00:45:15,801
You think so, huh?

908
00:45:16,135 --> 00:45:17,144
Absolutely.

909
00:45:17,344 --> 00:45:18,637
They won't take me for a killer.

910
00:45:18,971 --> 00:45:20,681
They'll let me go free.

911
00:45:21,014 --> 00:45:22,975
They'll send you to some new foster home.

912
00:45:23,308 --> 00:45:25,519
Probably make Mr. Morales'
place look like some pleasant

913
00:45:25,853 --> 00:45:27,029
dream to you.

914
00:45:28,647 --> 00:45:30,274
Unless, of course, you
want to play it smart

915
00:45:30,607 --> 00:45:33,402
for the first time in your life.

916
00:45:33,736 --> 00:45:36,238
How do I go about doing that, Bob?

917
00:45:36,572 --> 00:45:38,115
I got some money on me.

918
00:45:38,449 --> 00:45:39,416
I got an ATM card.

919
00:45:39,616 --> 00:45:41,535
We can go get some more, you go your way.

920
00:45:41,869 --> 00:45:42,995
I'll go mine.

921
00:45:43,328 --> 00:45:47,040
I swear to God you'll
never see or hear me again.

922
00:45:47,374 --> 00:45:48,500
What do you say?

923
00:45:50,294 --> 00:45:53,213
I say turn off on that exit up there.

924
00:45:53,547 --> 00:45:54,465
Jesus Christ, Vanessa.

925
00:45:54,798 --> 00:45:55,641
We're in the middle of nowhere.

926
00:45:55,841 --> 00:45:58,093
You want to get shot
a whole bunch of times?

927
00:45:58,427 --> 00:46:01,263
Now do like I tell you, dumb-ass.

928
00:46:01,597 --> 00:46:02,523
Okay.

929
00:46:02,723 --> 00:46:03,357
Okay I'm turning.

930
00:46:03,557 --> 00:46:05,601
You think this is a game?

931
00:46:18,155 --> 00:46:19,239
What are we going to do, Vanessa,

932
00:46:19,573 --> 00:46:20,374
drive around for three

933
00:46:20,574 --> 00:46:22,493
or four hours looking for a cop?

934
00:46:22,826 --> 00:46:23,827
Keep flapping your gums, Bob.

935
00:46:24,161 --> 00:46:26,079
Who cares, if no one is listening.

936
00:46:26,413 --> 00:46:29,041
Pull up on that dirt road over there.

937
00:46:46,850 --> 00:46:48,352
Now Bob, I know there's a lot of sick guys

938
00:46:48,685 --> 00:46:49,603
out there that get

939
00:46:49,937 --> 00:46:52,022
all hard thinking about messing women up.

940
00:46:52,356 --> 00:46:55,943
I mean, hell, that's
all you ever see on TV.

941
00:46:56,276 --> 00:46:57,694
But when a guy goes and
does that stuff for real,

942
00:46:58,028 --> 00:46:59,655
like you was planning
on doing to me tonight-

943
00:46:59,988 --> 00:47:00,948
Vanessa, I was just trying to scare you.

944
00:47:01,281 --> 00:47:03,575
You had your turn to talk.

945
00:47:03,909 --> 00:47:06,328
Okay, I think it's only fair
to let me get my two cents in.

946
00:47:06,662 --> 00:47:07,379
You're absolutely right.

947
00:47:07,579 --> 00:47:08,213
I'm sorry.

948
00:47:08,413 --> 00:47:09,373
Please, go on.

949
00:47:10,707 --> 00:47:13,877
When a guy hurts someone
who never hurt them,

950
00:47:14,211 --> 00:47:17,506
it makes him a criminal
first and a sick guy second.

951
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:21,176
Being sick has to take second
place to being crooked.

952
00:47:21,510 --> 00:47:23,387
And Bob, you're crooked.

953
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:26,557
You proved that to me tonight.

954
00:47:26,890 --> 00:47:28,183
Am I making any sense?

955
00:47:28,517 --> 00:47:30,727
Yes, there's so
much I want to tell you.

956
00:47:31,061 --> 00:47:31,695
Bob-

957
00:47:31,895 --> 00:47:32,938
Look, there's so much more to me

958
00:47:33,272 --> 00:47:33,906
than what you saw tonight.

959
00:47:34,106 --> 00:47:34,740
Bob!

960
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:36,149
Bob!
- Please.

961
00:47:36,483 --> 00:47:38,777
Time for talk is over, now.

962
00:47:41,905 --> 00:47:42,865
I'm going to ask you a question

963
00:47:43,198 --> 00:47:45,826
and it's real, real important, okay?

964
00:47:46,159 --> 00:47:47,085
What?

965
00:47:48,412 --> 00:47:50,163
Do you accept Jesus Christ as your Lord

966
00:47:50,497 --> 00:47:51,465
and personal Savior?

967
00:47:51,665 --> 00:47:52,791
Oh, my God.

968
00:47:53,125 --> 00:47:54,668
Vanessa, you're really scaring me.

969
00:47:55,002 --> 00:47:56,086
Tell me now, Bob.

970
00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:57,462
I need to know.

971
00:47:59,548 --> 00:48:01,258
Do you believe Jesus Christ is your Lord

972
00:48:01,592 --> 00:48:03,051
and personal Savior?

973
00:48:04,011 --> 00:48:05,387
Yes, I do.

974
00:48:05,721 --> 00:48:07,014
I swear.

975
00:48:07,347 --> 00:48:08,515
Good.

976
00:48:08,849 --> 00:48:09,892
That's really good.

977
00:49:02,903 --> 00:49:04,321
Oh God.

978
00:49:04,655 --> 00:49:05,581
Not like this.

979
00:49:37,562 --> 00:49:38,613
Oh God.

980
00:49:39,648 --> 00:49:41,984
Dear God, that was so fucking bad,

981
00:49:42,317 --> 00:49:45,779
but I was at a loss,
so I left it up to you.

982
00:49:46,863 --> 00:49:48,782
I love you with all my heart
and I hope you don't hate me

983
00:49:49,116 --> 00:49:50,993
more than you already do.

984
00:49:52,744 --> 00:49:56,206
Please bless Mamma, Larry and Chopper.

985
00:49:56,540 --> 00:49:57,465
Amen.

986
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:02,981
Oh yeah, sure thing.

987
00:51:03,315 --> 00:51:03,949
Regular?

988
00:51:04,149 --> 00:51:04,783
Yeah.

989
00:51:04,983 --> 00:51:06,860
Be right there.

990
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:28,090
I think I'll have the
double He-Man breakfast and

991
00:51:28,423 --> 00:51:30,801
a large sized cherry cola.

992
00:51:31,134 --> 00:51:32,060
Okay?

993
00:51:34,137 --> 00:51:35,188
What?

994
00:51:38,558 --> 00:51:40,227
I must look a fright.

995
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:41,728
Got a washroom?

996
00:51:54,116 --> 00:51:56,451
Dr. Barns, 4721.

997
00:51:56,785 --> 00:51:57,994
Dr. Barns, 4721.

998
00:52:01,665 --> 00:52:04,709
Dr. Cansino to ICU.

999
00:52:05,043 --> 00:52:07,129
Dr. Cansino to ICU.

1000
00:52:12,592 --> 00:52:14,553
Just one moment, please.

1001
00:52:19,349 --> 00:52:20,275
Please.

1002
00:52:21,601 --> 00:52:22,769
Please.

1003
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:25,071
Help me.

1004
00:52:25,939 --> 00:52:29,025
Call my wife, please.

1005
00:52:37,492 --> 00:52:39,911
- Freeze, police.
- Hey officer, what's up?

1006
00:52:40,245 --> 00:52:41,496
Let's go.

1007
00:52:41,830 --> 00:52:43,331
Sir, I did nothing wrong.

1008
00:52:43,665 --> 00:52:45,500
- Shut up.
- I did nothing wrong!

1009
00:52:45,834 --> 00:52:46,960
We've got a gun.

1010
00:52:47,294 --> 00:52:47,928
We've got a gun.

1011
00:52:48,128 --> 00:52:49,053
Big wow.

1012
00:52:50,463 --> 00:52:52,591
God, you know half the
goddamn world's got a gun,

1013
00:52:52,924 --> 00:52:54,259
and you're going to throw
me in the back of this-

1014
00:52:54,593 --> 00:52:56,553
Enough!

1015
00:52:56,887 --> 00:52:59,055
Give me a goddamn break.

1016
00:52:59,389 --> 00:53:03,185
What, you're not even going to
speak to me mister, oink man?

1017
00:53:03,518 --> 00:53:07,689
I bet you like-
- Backing up.

1018
00:53:09,482 --> 00:53:11,151
Mr. Wolverton.

1019
00:53:11,484 --> 00:53:12,119
Mr. Wolverton.

1020
00:53:13,612 --> 00:53:15,447
Mr. Wolverton has learned that
he's going to have to undergo

1021
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:17,407
a radical colectomy.

1022
00:53:17,741 --> 00:53:19,075
That's awful.

1023
00:53:19,409 --> 00:53:21,286
- Yeah!
- Oh, please no!

1024
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:22,746
There's a couple of detectives here

1025
00:53:23,079 --> 00:53:24,456
from the Sheriff's Department
that need to speak with you.

1026
00:53:28,710 --> 00:53:31,504
Mr. Wolverton, Mr. Wolverton.

1027
00:53:31,838 --> 00:53:33,048
Mr. Wolverton, can you hear me?

1028
00:53:33,381 --> 00:53:36,134
I'm Garnett Wallace, from
the Sheriff's Department.

1029
00:53:36,468 --> 00:53:39,221
I know you're in a lot of pain,
but can you take a moment?

1030
00:53:39,554 --> 00:53:41,139
I want to show you a photograph.

1031
00:53:41,473 --> 00:53:44,768
Tell me if this is the
person that shot you.

1032
00:53:45,101 --> 00:53:46,895
Is this the person that shot you?

1033
00:53:47,229 --> 00:53:48,438
Yes.

1034
00:53:48,772 --> 00:53:51,149
Are you sure this is
the person that shot you?

1035
00:53:52,776 --> 00:53:53,944
Okay, you'll be all right.

1036
00:54:04,329 --> 00:54:05,830
Mrs. Wolverton, your husband gave

1037
00:54:06,164 --> 00:54:07,249
a positive identification.

1038
00:54:07,582 --> 00:54:09,084
What happens now?

1039
00:54:09,417 --> 00:54:14,214
Well, you have to keep
in mind this is a juvenile

1040
00:54:14,589 --> 00:54:16,049
we're talking about.
- What?

1041
00:54:16,383 --> 00:54:17,309
Are you telling me you're
just going to let her go free?

1042
00:54:17,509 --> 00:54:19,219
I didn't say we're
going to let her go free.

1043
00:54:19,552 --> 00:54:22,013
She can be incarcerated
up to the age of 25.

1044
00:54:22,347 --> 00:54:23,231
For that?

1045
00:54:23,431 --> 00:54:24,232
Look at him.

1046
00:54:24,432 --> 00:54:25,317
10 years?

1047
00:54:25,517 --> 00:54:28,270
My husband is in there with
God knows how many bullets

1048
00:54:28,603 --> 00:54:30,897
in his head, and in his back.

1049
00:54:31,231 --> 00:54:34,609
She deliberately shot him
over and over and over again.

1050
00:54:34,943 --> 00:54:37,404
I want her held responsible.

1051
00:54:37,737 --> 00:54:39,614
Mrs. Wolverton, I assure you that

1052
00:54:39,948 --> 00:54:41,408
whoever did this isn't
just going to walk away.

1053
00:54:41,741 --> 00:54:42,826
What if he dies, huh?

1054
00:54:43,159 --> 00:54:45,870
If he dies, I think she should
be put in the electric chair.

1055
00:54:46,204 --> 00:54:47,089
- Gas.
- What?

1056
00:54:47,289 --> 00:54:49,708
They use gas in California.

1057
00:54:50,041 --> 00:54:52,460
I think you know what I mean, Detective.

1058
00:54:52,794 --> 00:54:54,713
I certainly hope that the
people that are responsible

1059
00:54:55,046 --> 00:54:57,215
for prosecuting this case can muster

1060
00:54:57,549 --> 00:54:59,634
just a little bit more
sensitivity to the rights

1061
00:54:59,968 --> 00:55:01,594
of the victims than you appear to have.

1062
00:55:01,928 --> 00:55:03,138
I didn't mean to sound uncaring.

1063
00:55:03,471 --> 00:55:05,598
I want that little
monster to pay for this.

1064
00:55:05,932 --> 00:55:09,394
For me, for my husband, for
the next person out there that

1065
00:55:09,728 --> 00:55:11,021
she'll end up hurting or killing

1066
00:55:11,354 --> 00:55:14,107
if God forbid she's allowed
back on the streets again.

1067
00:55:28,621 --> 00:55:29,873
Vanessa Lutz.

1068
00:55:30,206 --> 00:55:31,133
Yes, sir.

1069
00:55:31,333 --> 00:55:32,334
My name is Garnett Wallace

1070
00:55:32,667 --> 00:55:34,544
and this is my partner Mike Breer.

1071
00:55:34,878 --> 00:55:37,464
We're with the LA Sheriff's Department.

1072
00:55:37,797 --> 00:55:40,592
You're that guy on TV, aren't you?

1073
00:55:41,676 --> 00:55:42,686
Mm-hmm.

1074
00:55:42,886 --> 00:55:45,263
I'm investigating the I-5 murders.

1075
00:55:45,597 --> 00:55:47,640
Well y'all can all just
take a big old fucking cruise

1076
00:55:47,974 --> 00:55:50,477
because I took full out
care of that piece of shit.

1077
00:55:50,810 --> 00:55:54,564
Mr. Wolverton is in critical
condition, but he isn't dead.

1078
00:55:54,898 --> 00:55:55,866
Oh yeah, right.

1079
00:55:56,066 --> 00:55:57,942
I shot him so many times.

1080
00:55:59,652 --> 00:56:01,988
Aren't you concerned about being tried

1081
00:56:02,322 --> 00:56:04,282
as an adult for murder?

1082
00:56:04,616 --> 00:56:07,118
Vanessa, the reason
we're here is to give you

1083
00:56:07,452 --> 00:56:10,622
an opportunity to change your story.

1084
00:56:10,955 --> 00:56:15,668
Well, that would make me a
big fat liar, now wouldn't it?

1085
00:56:16,002 --> 00:56:17,379
Look kid.

1086
00:56:17,712 --> 00:56:19,672
Cooperate, because right now

1087
00:56:20,006 --> 00:56:21,549
we're the best friends you've got.

1088
00:56:21,883 --> 00:56:23,551
Yeah, I'm so sure.

1089
00:56:23,885 --> 00:56:25,387
You don't believe we're your friends?

1090
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:28,306
I believe you're out to ruin me.

1091
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:30,183
Look, I never said I wouldn't talk.

1092
00:56:30,517 --> 00:56:33,436
I might not happen to say
what y'all want to hear.

1093
00:56:33,770 --> 00:56:34,813
So, you want me to talk, that's fine.

1094
00:56:35,146 --> 00:56:38,566
But you've got to let me call
my fiancé right afterwards.

1095
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:40,151
Okay?

1096
00:56:40,485 --> 00:56:42,153
Okay?
- You can.

1097
00:56:42,487 --> 00:56:43,571
Fine.

1098
00:56:43,905 --> 00:56:45,073
No problem.

1099
00:56:45,407 --> 00:56:46,366
Now talk.

1100
00:56:46,699 --> 00:56:48,201
What do you want to know?

1101
00:56:48,535 --> 00:56:52,622
Did Mr. Wolverton say
he was the I-5 killer?

1102
00:56:52,956 --> 00:56:55,166
He didn't say he wasn't.

1103
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:57,043
I haven't said that I'm the I-5 killer.

1104
00:56:57,377 --> 00:56:58,753
And you haven't said
that you're going to slash

1105
00:56:59,087 --> 00:57:01,965
me dead with a razor and do
sex to my dead body, neither.

1106
00:57:02,298 --> 00:57:04,384
Mr. Wolverton
said that to you?

1107
00:57:04,717 --> 00:57:05,435
Yeah.

1108
00:57:05,635 --> 00:57:07,595
Right after he cut off all my hair.

1109
00:57:07,929 --> 00:57:10,306
Then he called me one
of them garbage people.

1110
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:12,517
Then I asked him if he was that I-5 Killer

1111
00:57:12,851 --> 00:57:14,853
and he just started
smiling all proud like.

1112
00:57:15,186 --> 00:57:19,107
You have an opportunity
now to clear your conscience.

1113
00:57:19,441 --> 00:57:22,986
I told the truth, and truth is eternal.

1114
00:57:24,571 --> 00:57:26,197
Vanessa Lutz,

1115
00:57:28,950 --> 00:57:30,952
you still haven't told us why you were

1116
00:57:31,286 --> 00:57:33,037
walking around with a loaded
pistol in the first place.

1117
00:57:33,371 --> 00:57:35,915
I was going to sell
it to finance my trip.

1118
00:57:36,249 --> 00:57:39,210
Oh, yet you ended up
shooting some poor slob

1119
00:57:39,544 --> 00:57:41,880
who had the decency to
give you a ride instead.

1120
00:57:42,213 --> 00:57:43,840
Yeah, except for the decency part.

1121
00:57:44,174 --> 00:57:45,800
When did you decide to rob him?

1122
00:57:46,134 --> 00:57:48,136
Was it before or after you shot him?

1123
00:57:48,470 --> 00:57:50,763
Look, that perv owed me
for pain and suffering.

1124
00:57:51,097 --> 00:57:52,307
So, yeah I took his money.

1125
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:53,483
Why didn't you just turn him in?

1126
00:57:53,683 --> 00:57:55,143
I wanted to, but he kept saying that

1127
00:57:55,477 --> 00:57:57,687
it would be his word
against mine and that he'd

1128
00:57:58,021 --> 00:58:00,732
just get off and I would
go to foster care again.

1129
00:58:01,065 --> 00:58:03,359
And aside from that, I just
knew that if I let him go,

1130
00:58:03,693 --> 00:58:05,361
he would go out and kill some other girl.

1131
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:07,363
And that would have been my fault.

1132
00:58:07,697 --> 00:58:10,325
And I couldn't have lived with that.

1133
00:58:10,658 --> 00:58:11,826
Never.

1134
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:13,085
No way.

1135
00:58:13,786 --> 00:58:14,796
Why were you so convinced

1136
00:58:14,996 --> 00:58:16,706
we wouldn't believe you?

1137
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:18,082
Because I've been in the system,

1138
00:58:18,416 --> 00:58:19,417
and once you've been in the system once,

1139
00:58:19,751 --> 00:58:22,086
ain't no one never going
to believe you again.

1140
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:24,506
It's just how it goes.

1141
00:58:24,839 --> 00:58:26,799
Tell us about your past legal problems.

1142
00:58:27,133 --> 00:58:28,510
It's all in my file.

1143
00:58:28,843 --> 00:58:31,054
I want to hear it from you.

1144
00:58:33,139 --> 00:58:34,190
Okay.

1145
00:58:36,976 --> 00:58:38,520
All right, when I was
younger, I used to have this

1146
00:58:38,853 --> 00:58:40,855
problem with shoplifting.

1147
00:58:41,189 --> 00:58:42,115
And I got caught.

1148
00:58:42,315 --> 00:58:45,485
And the judge sent me to
this group therapy session

1149
00:58:45,818 --> 00:58:48,071
for all these little girls
who was supposed to be clepto.

1150
00:58:48,404 --> 00:58:51,991
How many times were you
arrested for shoplifting Vanessa?

1151
00:58:52,325 --> 00:58:53,284
Seven times.

1152
00:58:55,620 --> 00:58:56,538
What else?

1153
00:58:59,666 --> 00:59:00,425
Okay.

1154
00:59:00,625 --> 00:59:02,001
Now this is going to sound bad,

1155
00:59:02,335 --> 00:59:05,255
but it's not as bad as it seems, okay?

1156
00:59:05,588 --> 00:59:09,717
But I learned later that I
had this problem with anger,

1157
00:59:10,051 --> 00:59:11,928
but I don't have that problem no more.

1158
00:59:12,262 --> 00:59:13,721
Just answer the question.

1159
00:59:14,055 --> 00:59:18,601
Back in Texas, these cops
said I lit this shed on fire.

1160
00:59:20,436 --> 00:59:21,196
What?

1161
00:59:21,396 --> 00:59:22,405
You were arrested for arson?

1162
00:59:22,605 --> 00:59:23,773
Yeah, but nobody got hurt.

1163
00:59:24,107 --> 00:59:25,108
It was no big deal.

1164
00:59:25,441 --> 00:59:26,776
And the judge even said
that I could get it

1165
00:59:27,110 --> 00:59:29,195
"explunged" from my record
if I was to go to these

1166
00:59:29,529 --> 00:59:31,614
group therapy sessions
with all them teenagers

1167
00:59:31,948 --> 00:59:34,534
who were supposed to be
firebugs or something.

1168
00:59:34,867 --> 00:59:38,037
But, um, that judge got switched.

1169
00:59:38,371 --> 00:59:40,164
So, that's why it's still there.

1170
00:59:40,498 --> 00:59:45,295
How many times
were you arrested for arson?

1171
00:59:46,421 --> 00:59:47,505
Three times.

1172
00:59:50,049 --> 00:59:51,134
Okay.

1173
00:59:51,467 --> 00:59:52,393
What else?

1174
00:59:53,177 --> 00:59:55,054
Come on Vanessa, tell us.

1175
00:59:56,973 --> 00:59:58,149
Soliciting.

1176
00:59:59,475 --> 01:00:02,186
Just doing what came natural, huh?

1177
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:03,529
Hey Mike.

1178
01:00:05,356 --> 01:00:08,067
What's that supposed to mean?

1179
01:00:08,359 --> 01:00:09,611
Let's get
back to the questions.

1180
01:00:09,944 --> 01:00:10,829
No, uh-<i>uh.</i>

1181
01:00:11,029 --> 01:00:12,864
What's that supposed to mean?

1182
01:00:13,197 --> 01:00:14,699
What, you think prostitution comes natural

1183
01:00:15,033 --> 01:00:16,409
like being a nigger?

1184
01:00:16,743 --> 01:00:17,910
Oh, wait you don't like
being called a nigger?

1185
01:00:18,244 --> 01:00:20,455
Well, I don't like being
called a natural born whore.

1186
01:00:20,788 --> 01:00:21,589
So there.

1187
01:00:21,789 --> 01:00:22,757
- Sit down.
- No!

1188
01:00:22,957 --> 01:00:25,043
He's talking to me the
way that fucking guy did.

1189
01:00:25,376 --> 01:00:26,419
Is that why you shot him?

1190
01:00:26,753 --> 01:00:29,297
Or was it because you wanted
what was in his wallet?

1191
01:00:29,631 --> 01:00:31,382
I already told you why I shot him,

1192
01:00:31,716 --> 01:00:33,176
you shit-skinned motherfucker.

1193
01:00:37,263 --> 01:00:39,307
Come on you fucking coon!

1194
01:00:39,641 --> 01:00:42,644
I'll kick your Black ass all
over this fucking station.

1195
01:00:42,977 --> 01:00:43,903
Shithead.

1196
01:00:45,688 --> 01:00:47,023
You okay, Mike?

1197
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:50,652
Why did you call him those names, Vanessa?

1198
01:00:50,985 --> 01:00:52,695
Because he didn't say he was sorry.

1199
01:00:53,029 --> 01:00:54,822
And I knew it would piss him off.

1200
01:00:55,156 --> 01:00:56,991
Now, how about that phone call?

1201
01:00:57,325 --> 01:00:58,084
Come on, come on.

1202
01:00:58,284 --> 01:01:00,286
I need another quarter.

1203
01:01:00,620 --> 01:01:01,545
Come on.

1204
01:01:06,042 --> 01:01:07,210
Hey Mrs. Wood.

1205
01:01:07,543 --> 01:01:08,753
Is Chopper there?

1206
01:01:39,158 --> 01:01:40,910
Holy shit.

1207
01:01:42,370 --> 01:01:45,832
Look who got beat with the ugly stick.

1208
01:01:46,165 --> 01:01:47,375
Is that you, Bob?

1209
01:01:49,043 --> 01:01:51,546
I can't believe such a teeny
weeny little gun made such

1210
01:01:51,879 --> 01:01:52,922
a big mess of some one.

1211
01:01:53,256 --> 01:01:55,299
Are you out of your mind?

1212
01:01:56,676 --> 01:01:58,511
You are so ugly, Bob!

1213
01:02:00,012 --> 01:02:02,265
That's going to cramp your
style with the babes, big time.

1214
01:02:02,598 --> 01:02:03,608
You know that, huh?

1215
01:02:03,808 --> 01:02:06,894
Especially little miss priss over there.

1216
01:02:07,228 --> 01:02:09,605
And hey I heard you have
one of them big poop bags

1217
01:02:09,939 --> 01:02:11,149
that's like attached to your body.

1218
01:02:11,482 --> 01:02:13,234
And all your shit comes
out and like lands in it.

1219
01:02:13,568 --> 01:02:15,862
You're just a big old
shit bag, ain't you Bob?

1220
01:02:16,195 --> 01:02:17,864
You just think of me every time you empty

1221
01:02:18,197 --> 01:02:19,323
that motherfucking thing, motherfucker.

1222
01:02:19,657 --> 01:02:20,291
Quiet.

1223
01:02:20,491 --> 01:02:22,285
Quiet, stay there.

1224
01:02:22,618 --> 01:02:24,120
All right.

1225
01:02:24,454 --> 01:02:27,623
One more word young lady
and you're going to be gagged.

1226
01:02:32,462 --> 01:02:35,298
The people versus Vanessa Julia Lutz.

1227
01:02:35,631 --> 01:02:37,300
Your honor, due to the heinous nature

1228
01:02:37,633 --> 01:02:40,803
of this crime and the defendant's
obvious lack of remorse,

1229
01:02:41,137 --> 01:02:43,347
the state moves that Vanessa Julia Lutz

1230
01:02:43,681 --> 01:02:45,141
be tried as an adult.

1231
01:02:45,475 --> 01:02:50,062
Your honor, my
client is an illiterate child.

1232
01:02:50,396 --> 01:02:51,606
One only has to look at her to see-

1233
01:02:51,939 --> 01:02:54,317
Oh, I've had my look, counselor.

1234
01:02:54,650 --> 01:02:56,652
And I've been listening, too.

1235
01:02:56,986 --> 01:02:58,613
And I'm going to direct
the youth authority

1236
01:02:58,946 --> 01:02:59,747
to prepare a report

1237
01:02:59,947 --> 01:03:04,160
on the defendant's suitability
to be tried as an adult.

1238
01:03:41,072 --> 01:03:42,740

Say hello to Vanessa.

Vanessa, this is Rhonda.

How you doing?

1257

I was hoping you could
show Vanessa around

1258
01:04:37,295 --> 01:04:38,838
the craft shop later.

1259
01:04:40,882 --> 01:04:41,932
I can't.

1260
01:04:42,925 --> 01:04:45,845
See, I'm on restriction.

1261
01:04:47,138 --> 01:04:50,141
Rhonda, what did you do this time?

1262
01:04:50,474 --> 01:04:55,229
Mrs. Joiner said that
I was touching Wanda Z

1263
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:57,899
all inappropriate.

1264
01:05:00,985 --> 01:05:04,822
Rhonda, I swear.

1265
01:05:12,663 --> 01:05:16,792
So, who'd you kill?

1266
01:05:17,126 --> 01:05:19,754
What makes you think I killed somebody?

1267
01:05:20,087 --> 01:05:23,132
Because they got you wearing one of them

1268
01:05:23,466 --> 01:05:24,926
orange murder suits.

1269
01:05:26,719 --> 01:05:29,555
Only the shooters wear them things.

1270
01:05:30,681 --> 01:05:35,186
Actually, I left him for
dead, but he pulled through.

1271
01:05:36,896 --> 01:05:40,900
Oh, I'm here for huffing paint.

1272
01:05:42,276 --> 01:05:44,570
They put you in here for that?

1273
01:05:44,904 --> 01:05:47,114
During the strip search,

1274
01:05:47,448 --> 01:05:50,326
they found a gram of tar in my cooch.

1275
01:05:51,827 --> 01:05:53,079
Do you like tar?

1276
01:05:54,121 --> 01:05:57,124
No, heroin is way too gnarly for me.

1277
01:05:58,793 --> 01:06:03,089
I don't get how a person
could go through their

1278
01:06:03,422 --> 01:06:06,133
whole lives never being into girls.

1279
01:06:09,845 --> 01:06:11,514
I just, I love girls.

1280
01:06:13,432 --> 01:06:15,393
You can keep them.

1281
01:06:15,726 --> 01:06:18,354
You don't know what you're missing.

1282
01:06:18,688 --> 01:06:20,272
♪ I said homeboy straight out ♪

1283
01:06:20,606 --> 01:06:21,983
♪ Gone again the very next day ♪

1284
01:06:22,316 --> 01:06:23,326
♪ I told him you ain't gonna stand there ♪

1285
01:06:23,526 --> 01:06:25,069
♪ You best step off ♪

1286
01:06:26,862 --> 01:06:28,197
Show-off alert.

1287
01:06:31,951 --> 01:06:32,877
How many?

1288
01:06:33,077 --> 01:06:37,415
Three, but you only
got to worry about one.

1289
01:06:49,927 --> 01:06:51,053
Cracker bunny.

1290
01:06:53,139 --> 01:06:56,475
They caught you ditching school, or what?

1291
01:06:58,644 --> 01:06:59,695
Bitch.

1292
01:07:00,479 --> 01:07:03,065
I'm fucking talking to you, man.

1293
01:07:07,611 --> 01:07:10,156
My name is Vanessa Julia Lutz.

1294
01:07:11,532 --> 01:07:12,533
Say it, cunt!

1295
01:07:22,918 --> 01:07:26,213
415 inmates only, module 1700.

1296
01:07:26,547 --> 01:07:29,508
Say my name before I
break your goddamn head.

1297
01:07:29,842 --> 01:07:30,643
Bitch!

1298
01:07:40,061 --> 01:07:41,028
Stick it in her.

1299
01:07:41,228 --> 01:07:42,354
Stick it in her.

1300
01:07:43,272 --> 01:07:44,648
Break it up!

1301
01:07:50,488 --> 01:07:51,413
Oh dear.

1302
01:07:55,409 --> 01:07:57,161
This isn't going to hurt a bit sweetie,

1303
01:07:57,495 --> 01:07:59,663
and afterwards, you'll
have a nice little nap.

1304
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:04,835
You can remove those pesky restraints now.

1305
01:08:35,282 --> 01:08:37,243
- Hi, honey.
- Grandma.

1306
01:08:37,576 --> 01:08:39,286
Here I am, hi, honey.

1307
01:08:41,122 --> 01:08:42,706
Grandma.

1308
01:08:44,291 --> 01:08:45,342
Hi.

1309
01:08:47,253 --> 01:08:49,046
Vanessa.
- Grandma.

1310
01:08:51,590 --> 01:08:52,516
Vanessa.

1311
01:08:56,303 --> 01:08:57,354
Vanessa.

1312
01:09:18,826 --> 01:09:20,494
Vanessa Julia Lutz.

1313
01:09:23,706 --> 01:09:27,168
Inmate shows no remorse for her crimes.

1314
01:09:30,004 --> 01:09:31,463
Inmate is combative.

1315
01:09:35,217 --> 01:09:39,680
Refuses to accept
responsibility for her actions.

1316
01:09:40,014 --> 01:09:41,390
Recommendations.

1317
01:09:41,724 --> 01:09:42,808
This inmate appears to be

1318
01:09:43,142 --> 01:09:45,895
a sophisticated criminal,
and an extreme danger

1319
01:09:46,228 --> 01:09:49,899
to society, and should be
required to pay the penalty

1320
01:09:50,232 --> 01:09:54,195
for her actions in a
facility for adult criminals.

1321
01:09:56,197 --> 01:09:57,323
Diagnosis,

1322
01:09:57,656 --> 01:10:00,117
antisocial personality disorder.

1323
01:10:01,785 --> 01:10:02,836
Prognosis,

1324
01:10:04,079 --> 01:10:05,130
very poor.

1325
01:10:06,540 --> 01:10:07,791
Recommendations,

1326
01:10:11,462 --> 01:10:13,547
this individual
is probably too far gone

1327
01:10:13,881 --> 01:10:16,300
to benefit from corrective
behavior modification

1328
01:10:16,634 --> 01:10:20,846
of the kind offered in
a setting for juveniles.

1329
01:10:50,751 --> 01:10:51,919
Hello, Vanessa.

1330
01:10:53,295 --> 01:10:56,757
Do you think you can
join the rest of us now?

1331
01:10:57,091 --> 01:11:00,052
If nobody gives me no more problems.

1332
01:11:03,639 --> 01:11:05,557
We need to put an end to the system

1333
01:11:05,891 --> 01:11:07,434
that lets dangerous violent thugs

1334
01:11:07,768 --> 01:11:11,438
be prosecuted as juveniles
rather than as adults

1335
01:11:11,772 --> 01:11:15,150
even when they have committed
the most vicious crimes.

1336
01:11:15,484 --> 01:11:18,028
Hi, this is Janice
Miller, of "Inside View".

1337
01:11:18,362 --> 01:11:20,781
We're here with Mr. Robert
Wolverton and his wife

1338
01:11:21,115 --> 01:11:23,993
Mimi Wolverton, at their
home in Orange County.

1339
01:11:24,326 --> 01:11:25,286
Would you describe some

1340
01:11:25,619 --> 01:11:28,205
of the hardships you've had to endure

1341
01:11:28,539 --> 01:11:31,000
since this ordeal began?

1342
01:11:31,333 --> 01:11:34,211
My husband has been
permanently disfigured.

1343
01:11:34,545 --> 01:11:36,088
How can he ever work with children again?

1344
01:11:36,422 --> 01:11:39,550
His appearance, well, it frightens them.

1345
01:11:40,843 --> 01:11:43,220
He's unable to have sexual relations.

1346
01:11:43,554 --> 01:11:46,223
You're saying your
husband is no longer capable

1347
01:11:46,557 --> 01:11:47,975
of achieving an erection?

1348
01:11:48,309 --> 01:11:50,811
That part of our lives is over now.

1349
01:11:51,145 --> 01:11:52,271
What makes me so angry

1350
01:11:52,604 --> 01:11:54,315
is how that little monster ridiculed us

1351
01:11:54,648 --> 01:11:55,816
during her preliminary hearing.

1352
01:11:56,150 --> 01:11:58,319
And the media, how dare
the media talk about

1353
01:11:58,652 --> 01:12:00,279
how horrible her life is.

1354
01:12:00,612 --> 01:12:01,580
What about us?

1355
01:12:01,780 --> 01:12:02,540
That psychopath.

1356
01:12:02,740 --> 01:12:05,576
She's been locked up nine, 10 times?

1357
01:12:05,909 --> 01:12:07,953
Why was she ever let back
out on the streets again

1358
01:12:08,287 --> 01:12:09,246
in the first place?

1359
01:12:09,580 --> 01:12:11,332
If the teenager who allegedly shot

1360
01:12:11,665 --> 01:12:12,750
your husband were here,

1361
01:12:13,083 --> 01:12:14,376
what would you want to say to her?

1362
01:12:14,710 --> 01:12:18,213
Was it worth the $300
she stole from my husband?

1363
01:12:18,547 --> 01:12:21,842
Are you bitter, Mr. Wolverton?

1364
01:12:22,176 --> 01:12:26,889
Well just, all the wonderful letters

1365
01:12:28,891 --> 01:12:32,227
that we received from across the country.

1366
01:12:33,270 --> 01:12:35,564
My dick may not function, but I have not

1367
01:12:35,898 --> 01:12:36,857
lost my smile.

1368
01:12:37,983 --> 01:12:39,818
I'm not a bitter man.

1369
01:12:41,153 --> 01:12:43,030
I know there's a lot of people

1370
01:12:43,364 --> 01:12:44,365
looking for some real life heroes,

1371
01:12:44,698 --> 01:12:46,909
and I think I've found a few.

1372
01:12:47,242 --> 01:12:50,079
Their courage is a real inspiration.

1373
01:12:50,412 --> 01:12:53,374
And now stay tuned for an
unusual story about a couple of

1374
01:12:53,707 --> 01:12:56,085
sweltering polar bears in Texas.

1375
01:13:23,946 --> 01:13:24,863
Holy shit.

1376
01:13:26,907 --> 01:13:27,825
It's okay.

1377
01:13:36,667 --> 01:13:40,712
Let me go get you some party punch.

1378
01:13:43,424 --> 01:13:45,384
No, I aint thirsty.

1379
01:13:50,931 --> 01:13:53,267
You're all wigged out, huh?

1380
01:13:55,394 --> 01:13:56,854
Just get all these bad nightmares once

1381
01:13:57,187 --> 01:13:58,897
I get out of isolation.

1382
01:14:03,902 --> 01:14:08,782
I'm so happy to get out
I can't even sleep at all,

1383
01:14:11,118 --> 01:14:13,203
let alone have nightmares.

1384
01:14:16,415 --> 01:14:20,127
For me it's like I get all shrunk down.

1385
01:14:20,461 --> 01:14:22,588
I don't get what you mean.

1386
01:14:25,257 --> 01:14:30,053
It's like I get like a
cat or a dog or something.

1387
01:14:30,387 --> 01:14:32,931
Until I'm just like they all are.

1388
01:14:35,017 --> 01:14:36,810
I get in the hole much
longer I'm just going

1389
01:14:37,144 --> 01:14:41,482
to be like this hermit,
shunning all human contact.

1390
01:14:41,815 --> 01:14:43,233
Scared like.

1391
01:14:45,736 --> 01:14:48,655
It's like that song says, Vanessa.

1392
01:14:50,824 --> 01:14:52,326
People need people.

1393
01:14:57,247 --> 01:15:00,250
I ain't so sure about that, Rhonda.

1394
01:15:01,627 --> 01:15:05,547
Well, what is it that
you think that you need?

1395
01:15:10,135 --> 01:15:12,012
I'll tell you.

1396
01:15:12,346 --> 01:15:16,975
Back in the hole, I decided
all I need to live is my will.

1397
01:15:23,065 --> 01:15:24,650
And a knife is good too.

1398
01:15:24,983 --> 01:15:27,986
So you don't feel so
at the mercy of events.

1399
01:15:32,533 --> 01:15:33,909
You made this?

1400
01:15:34,243 --> 01:15:37,371
Yeah, my stepfather Larry showed me how.

1401
01:15:37,704 --> 01:15:38,914
Pretty cool, huh?

1402
01:15:43,544 --> 01:15:46,088
What are you going to do with it?

1403
01:15:46,421 --> 01:15:49,091
Get the hell out of here.

1404
01:15:49,424 --> 01:15:52,427
You might have to mess
up some of the staff.

1405
01:15:52,761 --> 01:15:55,305
What, you really feel
sorry for them people?

1406
01:15:55,639 --> 01:15:57,432
You think normal people just
wake up one morning and decide

1407
01:15:57,766 --> 01:15:59,560
they're going to work in a prison?

1408
01:15:59,893 --> 01:16:03,647
They're perverts, every last one of them.

1409
01:16:03,981 --> 01:16:06,108
Any of them fuckos get in my
way I'm going to make them wish

1410
01:16:06,441 --> 01:16:07,534
they hadn't.

1411
01:16:15,450 --> 01:16:17,578
Do you like that?

1412
01:16:20,455 --> 01:16:23,292
I'll make out with you, but no fucking.

1413
01:16:23,625 --> 01:16:25,377
Because I'm straight.

1414
01:16:32,384 --> 01:16:33,510
Okay, you two.

1415
01:16:34,845 --> 01:16:36,722
Your honor, it's obvious
my client is a child

1416
01:16:37,055 --> 01:16:37,981
and very unstable.

1417
01:16:38,181 --> 01:16:38,816
It says right here,

1418
01:16:39,016 --> 01:16:40,434
"Nearly illiterate, emotionally immature,

1419
01:16:40,767 --> 01:16:42,352
prone to impulsivity, unpredictable."

1420
01:16:42,686 --> 01:16:43,770
Your honor, she is charged

1421
01:16:44,104 --> 01:16:46,440
with a gruesome crime.
- Counselor, please.

1422
01:16:46,773 --> 01:16:48,817
It goes on to say she
should be tried as an adult.

1423
01:16:49,151 --> 01:16:51,153
And stand trial
as an adult she will.

1424
01:16:51,486 --> 01:16:53,947
- Thank you, your honor.
- Jury selection will commence

1425
01:16:54,281 --> 01:16:55,907
on June 8th at 10 a.m.

1426
01:16:58,910 --> 01:17:00,245
Are we leaving?

1427
01:17:02,372 --> 01:17:03,582
What are y'all looking at?

1428
01:17:03,915 --> 01:17:05,083
Fuck all y'all.

1429
01:17:05,417 --> 01:17:06,960
Fuck you, chipmunk face.

1430
01:17:07,294 --> 01:17:09,588
And your fucking skipper wife.

1431
01:17:14,259 --> 01:17:15,886
I see here that you
and Vanessa were arrested

1432
01:17:16,219 --> 01:17:18,513
together twice in a period of two years.

1433
01:17:18,847 --> 01:17:20,974
Yeah, we needed the money.

1434
01:17:21,308 --> 01:17:22,643
We thought we'd be all
grown up turning tricks

1435
01:17:22,976 --> 01:17:25,228
on Warren Avenue right
outside the Snack and Shop,

1436
01:17:25,562 --> 01:17:28,482
except we got pinched
in like five minutes.

1437
01:17:28,815 --> 01:17:29,616
Bitch.

1438
01:17:29,816 --> 01:17:31,193
You two were engaged
in acts of prostitution

1439
01:17:31,526 --> 01:17:32,736
in the sixth grade.

1440
01:17:33,070 --> 01:17:35,530
I was only going to
jack them off, is all.

1441
01:17:35,864 --> 01:17:38,659
Did you ever see Vanessa act in an

1442
01:17:39,785 --> 01:17:42,329
overtly hostile way to
an actual human being?

1443
01:17:42,663 --> 01:17:45,999
You mean like
blow somebody's brains out

1444
01:17:46,333 --> 01:17:47,334
all over the place?

1445
01:17:47,668 --> 01:17:51,254
- Oh, you think that's funny?
- Yeah.

1446
01:17:51,588 --> 01:17:54,925
What about her
boyfriend who passed away?

1447
01:17:56,343 --> 01:17:58,428
It was pretty exclusive.

1448
01:18:00,722 --> 01:18:02,391
Okay, Sharon, that will be all for now.

1449
01:18:02,724 --> 01:18:04,184
Thank you very much.

1450
01:18:20,075 --> 01:18:22,911
I know she's blowing it over him.

1451
01:18:31,962 --> 01:18:33,964
Well, what do you know?

1452
01:18:40,053 --> 01:18:41,221
She's a coal burner.

1453
01:18:41,555 --> 01:18:43,181
What's a coal burner?

1454
01:18:43,515 --> 01:18:45,976
It means her boyfriend's Black.

1455
01:18:46,309 --> 01:18:48,478
- Are you surprised?
- Aren't you?

1456
01:18:48,812 --> 01:18:51,106
You know Mike, every kid we've spoken to

1457
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:54,693
about this Lutz girl seems to
hold her in very high regard.

1458
01:18:55,026 --> 01:18:56,528
Well, Wallace, look
at her friends outside.

1459
01:18:56,862 --> 01:18:57,904
They're the most fucked up
bunch of kids I've ever seen in

1460
01:18:58,238 --> 01:18:59,531
my damn life.

1461
01:18:59,865 --> 01:19:01,116
Still, something just doesn't-

1462
01:19:01,450 --> 01:19:02,659
What?

1463
01:19:03,952 --> 01:19:05,203
I've got to go back to the crime scene.

1464
01:19:05,537 --> 01:19:06,913
It's two and a
half hours away from here.

1465
01:19:07,247 --> 01:19:08,173
Wallace.

1466
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:10,500
Go, go, go.

1467
01:19:10,834 --> 01:19:12,753
Get it out of your system.

1468
01:19:52,834 --> 01:19:53,885
Go on.

1469
01:19:55,629 --> 01:19:57,339
Diamonds on the back ladies.

1470
01:19:57,672 --> 01:19:59,216
Diamonds on the back.

1471
01:20:01,343 --> 01:20:02,427
Get me some jerky.

1472
01:20:02,719 --> 01:20:03,895
Stay in line.

1473
01:20:16,316 --> 01:20:20,070
Don't forget to wash
your hands now, ladies.

1474
01:20:22,697 --> 01:20:25,408
Do you think that little guard's cute?

1475
01:20:25,742 --> 01:20:28,495
I guess, yeah sort of punky.

1476
01:20:31,039 --> 01:20:31,957
Better watch out because it's going

1477
01:20:32,290 --> 01:20:33,917
to get pretty crazy in here in a second.

1478
01:20:34,251 --> 01:20:36,837
You going to cut
up that cute little guard?

1479
01:20:37,170 --> 01:20:38,630
If he gets in my way, I will.

1480
01:20:38,964 --> 01:20:41,591
Man, you stupid,

1481
01:20:41,925 --> 01:20:43,677
if you think you can

1482
01:20:44,010 --> 01:20:46,012
get past both them two.

1483
01:20:46,346 --> 01:20:49,182
What the fuck do you
care what happens to me?

1484
01:20:49,516 --> 01:20:51,893
I'm here on double murder.

1485
01:20:52,227 --> 01:20:52,986
Okay?

1486
01:20:53,186 --> 01:20:54,354
In two years I'm going to be 18.

1487
01:20:54,688 --> 01:20:56,523
I'm going to be sent to
Frontera for 20 fucking years,

1488
01:20:56,857 --> 01:21:00,151
so why the hell shouldn't
we help each other, man?

1489
01:21:00,485 --> 01:21:04,906
Because two heads is a lot
fucking better than one head.

1490
01:21:09,953 --> 01:21:12,080
Hurry up in there, ladies.

1491
01:21:15,834 --> 01:21:17,085
Come on now.

1492
01:21:17,419 --> 01:21:18,511
All right.

1493
01:21:23,967 --> 01:21:25,719
Don't fucking breathe.

1494
01:21:26,928 --> 01:21:27,813
Vanessa.

1495
01:21:28,013 --> 01:21:29,097
I'm dead serious.

1496
01:21:29,431 --> 01:21:31,224
What did I say?
- Where did he go?

1497
01:21:31,558 --> 01:21:34,686
He went to get a beef treat, Mesquita,

1498
01:21:35,896 --> 01:21:37,063
and he'll be right back.

1499
01:21:37,397 --> 01:21:38,115
Shut up.

1500
01:21:38,315 --> 01:21:39,357
You can't get by the both of us.

1501
01:21:39,691 --> 01:21:41,318
- Shut up.
- Think about it.

1502
01:21:41,651 --> 01:21:42,577
Shut up.

1503
01:21:59,878 --> 01:22:01,922
My sister Brenda thinks you're cute.

1504
01:22:02,255 --> 01:22:02,931
I do not.

1505
01:22:03,131 --> 01:22:04,090
- You do, too.
- That's good.

1506
01:22:04,424 --> 01:22:06,593
Where's Mrs. Collins?

1507
01:22:06,927 --> 01:22:08,261
Mm-mm.

1508
01:22:11,806 --> 01:22:12,441
Yah!

1509
01:22:12,641 --> 01:22:14,017
Who told you you could fight?

1510
01:22:16,394 --> 01:22:17,562
You didn't have to kill me.

1511
01:22:17,896 --> 01:22:19,940
- What?
- You didn't have to kill me.

1512
01:22:20,273 --> 01:22:22,400
I didn't kill you, you
dirty little pervert.

1513
01:22:22,734 --> 01:22:27,322
Give me your goddamn car keys
before I cut your pecker off.

1514
01:22:27,656 --> 01:22:31,868
- He sure is bloody.
- Still think he's cute?

1515
01:22:36,206 --> 01:22:37,540
Fucking A, man.

1516
01:22:39,334 --> 01:22:40,710
There goes your fucking face.

1517
01:22:41,044 --> 01:22:43,630
Mesquita, I'd really like to go now.

1518
01:23:01,064 --> 01:23:02,983
Good night, everybody.

1519
01:23:10,907 --> 01:23:13,326
My homeys are here, Vanessa.

1520
01:23:20,333 --> 01:23:22,669
I missed you so much.

1521
01:23:24,129 --> 01:23:28,925
- You smell the same.
- What happened?

1522
01:23:29,259 --> 01:23:30,927
I was playing catch up.

1523
01:23:31,261 --> 01:23:34,639
This is my little bunkie Vanessa.

1524
01:23:42,856 --> 01:23:44,482
All right.

1525
01:23:51,281 --> 01:23:52,699
You look pretty.

1526
01:23:55,618 --> 01:23:58,204
You will think I'm sound
all feminist and shit.

1527
01:23:58,538 --> 01:24:00,874
It's like...

1528
01:24:01,207 --> 01:24:04,627
the one thing I learned in jail

1529
01:24:06,379 --> 01:24:10,175
is that girls got to help
out other girls, you know?

1530
01:24:10,508 --> 01:24:13,303
Especially convict girls, because,

1531
01:24:13,636 --> 01:24:16,556
if they don't they'll all be fucking dead.

1532
01:24:16,890 --> 01:24:17,891
You know what I mean?

1533
01:24:18,224 --> 01:24:21,186
I hear what you're saying.

1534
01:24:22,395 --> 01:24:23,446
Okay.

1535
01:24:27,233 --> 01:24:29,069
Need me to drop that off anywhere?

1536
01:24:29,402 --> 01:24:31,780
Nah, the owner he won't mind.

1537
01:24:36,451 --> 01:24:37,502
Yes.

1538
01:24:40,997 --> 01:24:42,999
You going to need this, girl.

1539
01:24:43,333 --> 01:24:45,001
Oh, Mesquita you've
already done too much for me.

1540
01:24:45,335 --> 01:24:46,294
This ain't even $20.

1541
01:24:46,628 --> 01:24:49,005
This bum's a total gas hog.

1542
01:24:49,339 --> 01:24:50,632
Don't be stupid.

1543
01:24:50,965 --> 01:24:54,052
You know, what I really need is a gun.

1544
01:25:02,227 --> 01:25:03,812
You going to give her my gun?

1545
01:25:04,145 --> 01:25:05,939
I'll get you another one, pendejo.

1546
01:25:06,272 --> 01:25:09,150
I'll get you a cellular too, and a beeper.

1547
01:25:09,484 --> 01:25:11,319
I get a hold of your ass.

1548
01:25:11,653 --> 01:25:13,279
Watch out for the pigs, Vanessa.

1549
01:25:13,613 --> 01:25:16,324
You know, I'm sorry for
busting your nose that time.

1550
01:25:16,658 --> 01:25:18,910
I was just real upset that day.

1551
01:25:19,244 --> 01:25:22,205
I'm all trying to work it so I can get

1552
01:25:22,539 --> 01:25:24,624
you to put out with me later on.

1553
01:25:24,958 --> 01:25:27,877
I guess I went about it pretty dumb, huh?

1554
01:25:28,211 --> 01:25:32,006
Mesquita, I'd put out for
you any day of the week.

1555
01:25:32,340 --> 01:25:34,425
I only do that in lockup.

1556
01:25:36,344 --> 01:25:37,270
Come here.

1557
01:25:48,273 --> 01:25:50,775
Good morning, Mrs. Wolverton.

1558
01:25:52,152 --> 01:25:53,653
Well, have you found her?

1559
01:25:53,987 --> 01:25:55,155
No, we haven't.

1560
01:25:55,488 --> 01:25:57,240
I really don't think
you're in any danger.

1561
01:25:57,574 --> 01:25:58,700
Oh, really?

1562
01:25:59,033 --> 01:26:00,243
Well, your life hasn't been ruined by

1563
01:26:00,577 --> 01:26:02,453
this little monster, has it?

1564
01:26:02,787 --> 01:26:04,747
Is your husband here
now, Mrs. Wolverton?

1565
01:26:05,081 --> 01:26:07,000
No, he's at St. John's
doing his physical therapy.

1566
01:26:07,333 --> 01:26:09,294
Now what the hell are you doing here?

1567
01:26:09,627 --> 01:26:10,545
Mike, go over to the hospital

1568
01:26:10,879 --> 01:26:13,047
and escort Mr. Wolverton
back here, please.

1569
01:26:13,381 --> 01:26:14,307
Why?

1570
01:26:16,801 --> 01:26:19,804
Mrs. Wolverton, I have
a search warrant here.

1571
01:26:20,138 --> 01:26:20,855
What?

1572
01:26:21,055 --> 01:26:23,308
If you would just sign it
anywhere, it would be fine.

1573
01:26:23,641 --> 01:26:25,685
I'm not signing anything.

1574
01:26:27,395 --> 01:26:29,606
Steve, make note that Mrs.
Wolverton refused to sign

1575
01:26:29,939 --> 01:26:31,399
and honor the search warrant.

1576
01:26:31,733 --> 01:26:32,984
I don't believe this.

1577
01:26:33,318 --> 01:26:34,360
So noted.

1578
01:26:34,694 --> 01:26:36,237
Okay, take care of the downstairs

1579
01:26:36,571 --> 01:26:38,114
and make sure that you
check out the garage,

1580
01:26:38,448 --> 01:26:41,075
the backyard and everything thoroughly.

1581
01:26:41,409 --> 01:26:43,244
What's this all about?

1582
01:26:43,578 --> 01:26:45,663
Mrs. Wolverton, certain
evidence has come to light,

1583
01:26:45,997 --> 01:26:47,874
which we are duty bound to investigate.

1584
01:26:48,208 --> 01:26:49,209
What sort of evidence?

1585
01:26:49,542 --> 01:26:51,336
I would prefer to
discuss it in the presence

1586
01:26:51,669 --> 01:26:54,380
of your husband, if you don't mind.

1587
01:26:55,590 --> 01:26:57,800
There's a storage shed out back.

1588
01:26:58,134 --> 01:27:00,011
I'm going to take a look.

1589
01:27:01,012 --> 01:27:03,598
You wouldn't happen to
have the key, would you?

1590
01:27:03,932 --> 01:27:05,099
Fuck you.

1591
01:27:05,433 --> 01:27:06,726
Didn't think so.

1592
01:27:25,328 --> 01:27:26,663
Robert Wolverton.

1593
01:27:27,664 --> 01:27:28,590
Correct.

1594
01:27:28,790 --> 01:27:29,715
Age 32.

1595
01:27:30,875 --> 01:27:33,503
Yeah, forensics is on its way.

1596
01:27:33,836 --> 01:27:38,132
Tony found some remains,
human, animal who knows.

1597
01:27:38,466 --> 01:27:39,592
Mrs. Wolverton, were you aware your

1598
01:27:39,926 --> 01:27:42,053
husband had mental problems?

1599
01:27:43,596 --> 01:27:45,598
Those were, those were,

1600
01:27:47,767 --> 01:27:49,477
those were children?

1601
01:27:49,811 --> 01:27:51,229
Children?

1602
01:27:51,562 --> 01:27:52,488
Yes.

1603
01:27:53,314 --> 01:27:54,983
Just like the Lutz girl
we've been dying to see get

1604
01:27:55,316 --> 01:27:57,527
strapped down in the gas chamber.

1605
01:28:02,031 --> 01:28:02,991
Will you ease up on her?

1606
01:28:03,324 --> 01:28:04,575
Fuck her.

1607
01:28:23,845 --> 01:28:24,846
Jesus Christ.

1608
01:28:39,777 --> 01:28:40,828
Shit.

1609
01:28:51,205 --> 01:28:52,298

Fuck you, too.

01:29:38,336 --> 01:29:40,004
Back again, huh?

1622
01:29:40,338 --> 01:29:41,381
Wanna fuck?

1623
01:29:41,714 --> 01:29:42,723
How much?

1624
01:29:48,930 --> 01:29:50,765
Depends on what you're into.

1625
01:29:51,099 --> 01:29:52,225
You suck cock?

1626
01:29:55,937 --> 01:29:56,896
Sure.

1627
01:29:57,230 --> 01:29:58,189
I can do that.

1628
01:29:59,899 --> 01:30:02,193
- I just want to get sucked.
- All right.

1629
01:30:02,527 --> 01:30:03,820
You just find us an alley
and I'll take care of you

1630
01:30:04,153 --> 01:30:05,446
right where you're sitting.

1631
01:30:05,780 --> 01:30:07,490
I'll pay you $25.

1632
01:30:07,824 --> 01:30:09,450
I can live with that.

1633
01:30:09,784 --> 01:30:10,710
Let's go.

1634
01:30:19,001 --> 01:30:20,336
You're underage, aren't you?

1635
01:30:20,670 --> 01:30:21,512
What, is that a problem?

1636
01:30:21,712 --> 01:30:23,047
No.

1637
01:30:23,381 --> 01:30:25,550
Young people gotta live, too.

1638
01:30:25,883 --> 01:30:27,301
You sure got that right.

1639
01:30:27,635 --> 01:30:29,053
Now get them all down, okay?

1640
01:30:29,387 --> 01:30:32,265
Makes it a whole lot easier that way.

1641
01:30:39,772 --> 01:30:41,232
Give me all your money.

1642
01:30:41,566 --> 01:30:42,692
All of it.

1643
01:30:43,025 --> 01:30:43,993
Goddamn it.

1644
01:30:45,361 --> 01:30:46,246
Jesus.

1645
01:30:46,446 --> 01:30:47,080
Okay.

1646
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:47,914
Hey, hey.

1647
01:30:48,114 --> 01:30:48,831
I'm sorry, okay, okay?

1648
01:30:49,031 --> 01:30:50,533
I was aiming at your head, mister.

1649
01:30:50,867 --> 01:30:52,160
Okay, I'm sorry.

1650
01:30:52,493 --> 01:30:53,703
If you get this over quick we'll both be

1651
01:30:54,036 --> 01:30:55,913
a lot happier, okay?

1652
01:30:56,247 --> 01:30:58,166
My money is in my
briefcase in the back seat.

1653
01:30:58,499 --> 01:30:59,709
Don't move it.

1654
01:31:00,042 --> 01:31:03,254
Just lean over and open
it up where it's laying.

1655
01:31:03,588 --> 01:31:06,174
And keep your pants where
they are, mister dirty mouth.

1656
01:31:06,507 --> 01:31:07,683
Okay, okay.

1657
01:31:09,051 --> 01:31:09,936
Okay.

1658
01:31:10,136 --> 01:31:11,888
Don't swing that
motherfucking thing at me

1659
01:31:12,221 --> 01:31:14,307
or I swear to God you're dead.

1660
01:31:14,640 --> 01:31:15,650
You believe me?

1661
01:31:15,850 --> 01:31:16,767
Why are you doing this?

1662
01:31:17,101 --> 01:31:18,936
Because I'm pissed off
and the whole world owes me.

1663
01:31:19,270 --> 01:31:21,314
Give me your goddamn money.

1664
01:31:31,240 --> 01:31:32,450
Where's the rest of it?

1665
01:31:32,783 --> 01:31:34,243
That's all I got.

1666
01:31:34,577 --> 01:31:36,704
You was just going to give me $5?

1667
01:31:37,038 --> 01:31:38,998
Please, please, please, just take it.

1668
01:31:39,332 --> 01:31:39,966
Okay?

1669
01:31:40,166 --> 01:31:40,800
Please.

1670
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:42,376
Get out of the goddamn car right now,

1671
01:31:42,710 --> 01:31:44,337
you little pecker snot.

1672
01:31:44,670 --> 01:31:45,596
Right now!

1673
01:31:46,756 --> 01:31:47,798
No, uh-<i>uh.</i>

1674
01:31:48,132 --> 01:31:52,595
You get all them panties off
before I get really pissed.

1675
01:31:53,971 --> 01:31:55,306
You think I'm kidding?

1676
01:31:57,934 --> 01:32:00,228
Now get your ass in the trunk.

1677
01:32:01,854 --> 01:32:05,358
Please, I'm claustrophobic.

1678
01:32:05,691 --> 01:32:06,326
Yeah.

1679
01:32:06,526 --> 01:32:07,735
Well, I get claustrophobic
sucking strange dick.

1680
01:32:08,069 --> 01:32:09,037
Get in there.

1681
01:32:09,237 --> 01:32:10,780
Please, please.

1682
01:32:11,113 --> 01:32:12,040
I gotta pee.

1683
01:32:12,240 --> 01:32:13,741
Well, pee in there motherfucker.

1684
01:32:14,075 --> 01:32:15,243
I ain't kidding.

1685
01:32:15,576 --> 01:32:16,502
Now.

1686
01:32:17,245 --> 01:32:18,454
Dumbass.

1687
01:32:18,788 --> 01:32:19,713
Dick.

1688
01:32:33,469 --> 01:32:34,520
Fuck.

1689
01:32:54,156 --> 01:32:54,957
I'm sorry sir.

1690
01:32:55,157 --> 01:32:57,618
This is a no smoking restaurant.

1691
01:33:11,924 --> 01:33:14,844
You really are a dear, Flo.

1692
01:33:18,764 --> 01:33:21,934
Would you care for a warm up?

1693
01:33:22,268 --> 01:33:23,728
No, thank you.

1694
01:33:24,061 --> 01:33:25,354
I'd like to order.

1695
01:33:26,564 --> 01:33:28,649
What would you like?

1696
01:33:28,983 --> 01:33:30,192
Chicken soup,

1697
01:33:31,277 --> 01:33:32,945
with a fucking straw.

1698
01:34:05,269 --> 01:34:06,070
Let me out.

1699
01:34:06,270 --> 01:34:07,188
I'm dying in here.

1700
01:34:07,521 --> 01:34:08,364
Oh, you are?

1701
01:34:08,564 --> 01:34:09,690
Well, do it now.

1702
01:34:10,691 --> 01:34:12,109
Will you slow down for Christ's sake?

1703
01:34:12,443 --> 01:34:14,737
You're going to get us killed.

1704
01:34:15,905 --> 01:34:16,664
There.

1705
01:34:16,864 --> 01:34:18,199
There's the exit.

1706
01:34:28,834 --> 01:34:29,885
Grandma.

1707
01:34:32,213 --> 01:34:33,263
Grandma.

1708
01:34:35,049 --> 01:34:36,100
Grandma.

1709
01:34:41,305 --> 01:34:42,515
Grandma.

1710
01:35:37,236 --> 01:35:40,197
Let me out, I'm dying in here!

1711
01:35:40,531 --> 01:35:42,324
Hey, wait a minute, hey!

1712
01:35:44,493 --> 01:35:46,662
Grandma, it's me!

1713
01:35:46,996 --> 01:35:48,122
It's me Vanessa!

1714
01:35:49,457 --> 01:35:50,458
Hey, Grandma!

1715
01:35:51,751 --> 01:35:52,552
It's me Vanessa.

1716
01:35:54,670 --> 01:35:55,763
Hi, Grandma.

1717
01:35:57,465 --> 01:35:58,799
Grandma, wake up.

1718
01:35:59,925 --> 01:36:01,677
It's time to wake up.

1719
01:36:02,011 --> 01:36:02,970
I'm your granddaughter.

1720
01:36:03,304 --> 01:36:06,015
I'm here to take care of you
forever and ever and ever.

1721
01:36:06,348 --> 01:36:07,725
Why are you hiding?

1722
01:36:09,268 --> 01:36:10,603
Here, let me see.

1723
01:36:14,648 --> 01:36:18,110
Them some big ugly fucking
teeth you got, Bob.

1724
01:36:21,697 --> 01:36:23,741
How do you like that, Vanessa?

1725
01:36:24,074 --> 01:36:25,117
You like how that fucking feels?

1726
01:36:25,451 --> 01:36:27,244
What did you do with my grandma?

1727
01:36:27,578 --> 01:36:29,955
You want to see your grandma?

1728
01:36:32,124 --> 01:36:34,418
Why don't you give Grandma a kiss?

1729
01:36:34,752 --> 01:36:36,170
You fucker!

1730
01:36:36,504 --> 01:36:38,005
You killed my grandma.

1731
01:36:38,339 --> 01:36:40,549
That's not all I did to Grandma.

1732
01:36:43,719 --> 01:36:44,353
Naomi.

1733
01:36:44,553 --> 01:36:47,431
Naomi, listen, I brought
you an extension cord.

1734
01:36:53,312 --> 01:36:53,946
You like that, Bob?

1735
01:36:54,146 --> 01:36:55,481
Die, you piece of shit.

1736
01:37:01,195 --> 01:37:02,287
Die, fucker!

1737
01:37:07,743 --> 01:37:08,702
Back inside.

1738
01:37:17,378 --> 01:37:19,505
Die, you piece of shit.

1739
01:37:22,508 --> 01:37:23,517
Let's go.

1740
01:37:27,930 --> 01:37:28,973
Vanessa!

1741
01:37:31,100 --> 01:37:32,393
Fucking piece of shit!

1742
01:37:34,728 --> 01:37:35,904
Fucking perv.

1743
01:37:36,856 --> 01:37:38,524
Die, motherfucker.

1744
01:37:38,858 --> 01:37:40,192
Die, you mother.

1745
01:37:40,526 --> 01:37:41,451
Vanessa.

1746
01:37:42,111 --> 01:37:43,362
Piece of shit.

1747
01:37:45,614 --> 01:37:46,949
Vanessa!

1748
01:37:48,909 --> 01:37:49,794
Vanessa!

1749
01:37:49,994 --> 01:37:51,662
Fucking piece of shit.

1750
01:37:53,330 --> 01:37:55,958
Who's the moron now, motherfucker?

1751
01:37:57,251 --> 01:37:58,177
Huh?

1752
01:37:59,420 --> 01:38:00,588
Huh?

1753
01:38:02,172 --> 01:38:03,140
Vanessa!

1754
01:38:07,052 --> 01:38:09,013
Die, you fuck, die!

1755
01:38:10,764 --> 01:38:11,690
Die!

1756
01:38:29,408 --> 01:38:30,701
Shit.

1757
01:38:31,035 --> 01:38:32,745
Get out of there.

1758
01:38:33,078 --> 01:38:34,246
Get out of there.

1759
01:38:54,516 --> 01:38:55,434
Holy shit.

1760
01:38:59,104 --> 01:39:00,155
Holy shit.

1761
01:39:04,443 --> 01:39:05,494
Holy shit.

1762
01:39:18,749 --> 01:39:20,626
Y'all got a cigarette?
