1
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,000
-What's happening?
- Nick, we've got a young punk here.

2
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:50,000
- Nice bike. Fast, huh?
- Yeah.

3
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,700
- You want to bet?
- Ain't you got nothing betterto do?

4
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:00,800
I say $50 on Nick.

5
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,700
- What do you say?
- Yeah, sure.

6
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,300
I'll take your social security.

7
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:36,400
You're a real fucking whacko,
you know that, pal?

8
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:08,100
Nicky, it's me.
The school called again.

9
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:12,400
We're three months behind.
I told them we'd send a cheque.

10
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,500
I'm taking the kids
to Mom's on Saturday.

11
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,900
Good luck today. Bye.

12
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,700
Nick Conklin? Barney Adell, attorney.

13
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:28,000
Do yourself a favour,
wear a jacket and tie today.

14
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,600
How are you, pal?

15
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,400
Patrick has been
calling Sister Elizabeth names.

16
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,300
- I called her an ugly goose.
- That's not so bad.

17
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:08,200
Give this money to Mommy.
I'll see you in two days.

18
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,300
Have a good day at school.

19
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,400
All right, hang on tight.

20
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:09,100
I hope somebody is paying you
to wear that suit.

21
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:13,500
Come on, get on. I don't want
anybody to see you like that.

22
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:20,600
- New shoes, $85 a pop.
- I hope you're wearing socks.

23
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,700
Ladies of the 80's
are going for shoes.

24
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:28,900
They say it's the second place
they're looking.

25
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:34,700
I heard that an lnternal Affairs
review isn't all that bad.

26
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:41,100
- I'll let you know when it's over.
- Show up in uniform, with your medals.

27
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:47,700
I'm serious. You've got
commendations up the yin yang.

28
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:57,600
- Vincent, let's go.
- Yeah, hold on to your dick.

29
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:03,200
- Meet me at Scalari's for lunch.
- We'll see how it goes.

30
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:07,400
If you don't show up,
you're going to be in real trouble.

31
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,600
13:00, do or die.

32
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,000
- You watch your tail.
- Yeah.

33
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:28,400
You'll walk. Just tell the truth.
Run your mouth, they'll screw you.

34
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:33,500
- I've got nothing to hide.
- I hope not, for my sake.

35
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:37,200
- Hi Nick, good luck.
- Thanks.

36
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:41,000
- How's your lawyer?
- I hardly know him.

37
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:47,000
Ifthese people get their way,
you'll get to know him real well.

38
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,300
You'll be sending his kids
through college.

39
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:09,400
- That's an impressive record.
- A regular hero.

40
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,600
- Tell me about Monte Ronan.
- Good cop.

41
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:18,200
He's the kind of guy you want
around when the shit goes down.

42
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:21,300
- That's what you think.
- Yeah.

43
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:25,400
- He's dirt.
- Yeah? Have you worked the streets?

44
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,800
We've got 30 homicides a week.

45
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:36,400
- Tell us about Patrick Donleavy.
- My client knows of no malfeasance.

46
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:40,700
28 June, '88.
Your unit arrested three suspects.

47
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,800
Cash was logged in at $65,000
and change.

48
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,800
We have reason to believe
there was over $73,000.

49
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,600
- Our sources say...
- Just listen to the cops.

50
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,400
It depends on the cops. Some
heroes think the rules don't apply.

51
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:01,500
I try to do my job.
It ain't easy, but I'm clean.

52
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,900
You have two kids in school.
House payments.

53
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:11,700
Alimony and an apartment.
I admire your thrift.

54
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:18,900
- Well, life's a bitch.
- You're out at least 1,000 a month.

55
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:22,900
If you want to charge me, charge me.
If not, go back to your office.

56
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:27,100
We'll charge you.
We can always get to a dirty cop.

57
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:33,400
You want dirt, go to City Hall.
Don't come here busting my ass!

58
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:40,900
- Suits!
- Are you okay?

59
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,500
How are the girls in Japan?

60
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:56,100
What is the most important control
exercised by a sergeant?

61
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:00,600
- A, cost control?
- B, manpower control.

62
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:06,900
What are we going for here,
sergeant or the supreme court?

63
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:11,000
How are you doing, Joe?
Give me a Scotch.

64
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,200
- That bad?
- I can't take any more of this shit.

65
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:19,000
He's going to be drinking his lunch.

66
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,600
To the lnternal Affairs Division:
Fuck 'em!

67
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:31,600
You ought to think about that. It's
a fast way to get to headquarters.

68
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:36,000
- You never know.
- That's right.

69
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,500
- Did you see Abolafia?
- I saw him.

70
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,700
- I hear he's importing Subarus.
- Wise guys have got to eat, too.

71
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:50,600
Lunching with the mob. Intelligence
has probably got this place wired.

72
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:55,300
Just talk into my left titty.

73
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,200
Look out!

74
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,800
What's going on?

75
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:05,500
- Don't even think about it.
- It's done, babe.

76
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:17,100
What did you say?

77
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:57,000
Sit down.
Relax.

78
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:05,200
Just relax.
Mind your business.

79
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:16,200
- Joe, call 911.
- Police!

80
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:43,000
- Hold it!
- Get out ofthe way!

81
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,000
Police! Get out of here!

82
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,800
Get the fuck out of here.

83
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,900
The guy who came through here,
where did he go?

84
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:33,000
Get out!

85
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,100
Out! Get out!

86
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:40,000
- Nicky, where are you?
- Here!

87
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:47,300
You hear me?
Are you okay?

88
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:52,100
Up. I've got him...
Up!

89
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:56,500
Okay, nice and easy.

90
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,900
Come on.

91
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,300
You little fuck.

92
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,900
You little shit!

93
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:11,400
Take him out of here.

94
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:20,800
Are you okay?

95
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Japanese mob.

96
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:34,200
The victims are certainly yakuza.

97
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:39,000
What were the Jap mob
and the Mafia doing over lunch?

98
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:43,700
- Nobody knows nothing?
- Nobody knows dick.

99
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:49,400
- Is that the paper the box was in?
- Yeah.

100
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,600
The famous box.

101
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:56,600
I'm going downstairs
to give our little darling a talk.

102
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:12,100
He doesn't speak English and
he ain't talking too much Japanese.

103
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:16,000
- Who's this guy?
- Japanese Embassy.

104
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:21,700
- They want him first.
- My collar, my case.

105
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:35,800
I got two clean homicides in there.
I almost bought it.

106
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,300
If they want him, they can
have him... after 20 years to life.

107
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:50,200
- What's this?
- The State Department.

108
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:55,700
They talk to me, I talk to you.
Shit rolls downhill.

109
00:18:55,900 --> 00:19:00,300
You and Vincent
are talking him back.

110
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:04,800
- This is bullshit!
- Don't start up again, Nick.

111
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:10,900
You already went off in their faces.
Take a breather, relax.

112
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:16,700
- Get a geisha. Do us both a favour.
- Give that to lnternal Affairs.

113
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:20,100
They can water my plants.

114
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:25,900
I'll stand behind you 100%...
as long as you're right.

115
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:29,200
As long as you're right.

116
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:11,200
What is it costing the city
to send this asshole home?

117
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,300
It isn't worth the cost of the dirt
to bury him.

118
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:20,000
You know Ronan, right?
He's a good cop.

119
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:26,200
- Yeah, he's a good cop.
- He's a good cop.

120
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:33,800
He busts his ass 14 hours a day
and ends up in debt for life.

121
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,900
Now look at this asshole. The man
is wearing my house payments.

122
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:43,000
What Ronan did was wrong.

123
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:49,000
He just took something
off a dealer he locked up.

124
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:56,800
You wait till you get a family.
The man was just trying to get by.

125
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,500
What the fuck are you looking at?

126
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:06,900
- What happened?
- I don't know.

127
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:10,300
He bit his lip or something.
Seat belt tight, babe?

128
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:00,700
We've got the local heat.

129
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:06,300
I think you are looking for us.
Detective Conklin from New York.

130
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:12,700
Welcome to Japan.
I am Inspector Nashida.

131
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:16,800
This is my partner,
Detective Vincent.

132
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,600
Do you have some paperwork for us?

133
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:24,600
Would you sign here
and here, please?

134
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,200
Key, please.

135
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,900
Thank you.

136
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,500
Come on, Nicky.

137
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:10,700
Off duty! I'll be in and out of geishas
like a Time's Square pickpocket.

138
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:16,500
Remember ladies, if you get bored,
Hotel Meiji.

139
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:21,300
I am Inspector Yamato,
Osaka Police.

140
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:45,900
They were dressed as offiicers.
It was in Japanese.

141
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:49,200
All right?

142
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:08,000
They were wearing uniforms.
They had the paperwork.

143
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:13,000
Definite maybes
and definite don't knows.

144
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:16,700
It ain't a lot of fun over here.

145
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:23,200
I went by the book.
There's no way to verify the ID.

146
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:26,500
- Maybe, I don't know.
- Nine definite maybes.

147
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:32,300
- Could I score some coffee?
- Coffee? One?

148
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:36,800
The paperwork is in Japanese.
I can't do a strip search.

149
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:40,100
I've been here two hours.

150
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:45,900
How much more time?

151
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,100
He does that one more time,
I'll cut it off.

152
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,300
Unbelievable, identical strangers.

153
00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:01,300
This is still an NYPD collar, right?

154
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:07,000
- Noodles? Don't hurt yourself.
- I'll salvage the situation.

155
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:21,100
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

156
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:30,300
Tell the IAD suits to kiss my ass.
Enough of this bullshit.

157
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:35,200
Are we on?
Nicky, game time.

158
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:39,600
We're on, Captain.
I'll call you later.

159
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:46,400
- What did Oliver have to say?
- You don't want to know.

160
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,500
- Are you going to be nice?
- I'll be nice.

161
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:54,000
I just hope one ofthese Nips
speaks English.

162
00:26:55,400 --> 00:27:02,200
Assistant Inspector
Matsumoto Masahiro, Osaka Police.

163
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,700
And I do speak fucking English.

164
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,600
Ask if there were
any witnesses at the airport.

165
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:26,200
The superintendent says
it's possible.

166
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:31,700
Manned space flight is possible.
Am I missing something here?

167
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:37,700
- He's tired from the flight.
- Could I get some coffee?

168
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:45,100
Tell us who this Sato guy is
and maybe we can help you.

169
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:50,500
Translate every word.
I want every word translated.

170
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:53,800
Yes, I understand.

171
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:10,100
Because of your negligence
a criminal has escaped.

172
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:13,400
- You should apologise.
- Our negligence?

173
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:20,500
They had your documents, your
uniforms and were in a secure area.

174
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:25,900
We'll take some ofthe heat for this
but we're not taking the rap.

175
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:30,500
- The bite, the fall.
- The blame.

176
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:39,600
- This is an insurance policy.
- He speaks English.

177
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:44,500
The police will find
your escaped prisoner.

178
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:48,400
You are foreigners. Nothing more
than interested observers.

179
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:55,500
- Go home, detective.
- This is an international incident.

180
00:28:55,700 --> 00:29:00,900
Until you sign off on this dickhead,
his ass is mine.

181
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:08,300
We either work together on this
together or I'm going to the Press.

182
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:12,900
- All right, you can stay.
- Thank you.

183
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:16,700
- You have to leave your guns.
- We're police offiicers.

184
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:22,400
You are civilians here. It is
illegal for you to carry a gun.

185
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:26,100
We understand.
Nick, your gun.

186
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:31,000
- Happy?
- All your guns.

187
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:37,300
You assign us a cop
who can find his ass with two hands.

188
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:42,400
- What?
- He wants a tough cop.

189
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:48,200
Of course. You will have
one of our top offiicers.

190
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:54,400
It sounds good,
or he's working on the dinner menu.

191
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:59,400
- Sayanora, Chief.
- Where's our cop?

192
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:03,800
It is my honour.

193
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:37,200
Stay close, please.

194
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:27,300
- Can we take a look at him?
- Just a moment.

195
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:34,300
This is one ofthe phoney cops
from the airport.

196
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:38,100
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

197
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:47,000
He's got no defensive wounds.
A nice, clean right-handed cut.

198
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:52,200
He's a fresh puppy.
The perpetrator could be wet.

199
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,800
Look at this.

200
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:00,700
Nice, maybe he's got
two fives for a ten.

201
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:07,700
The superintendent thanks you.
We should go.

202
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:11,900
Wait a minute.
Tell us what's going on.

203
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:17,200
- Is Sato doing his own guy?
- Don't interfere.

204
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:24,000
- I'm not interfering. This is what I do.
- You're just observers.

205
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:28,500
I usually get kissed
before I get fucked.

206
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:35,200
- What did he say?
- He likes a little foreplay.

207
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:08,700
- Detective!
- He's not going to break anything.

208
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:19,500
A little peroxide
will get rid of the bloodstain.

209
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:23,800
- What are you?
- Detective Conklin, NYPD.

210
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,600
How did you get that blood?

211
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:31,600
The girls think you're the guy
who lost Sato at the airport.

212
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:35,700
Just offthe plane
and you make the evening news.

213
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:39,400
Americans who are less than perfect
are amusing.

214
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:42,300
Can I talk to you?

215
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:47,600
How did you get the blood?

216
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:54,100
The girl who found the body was
upset, so I put my arms around her.

217
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:58,200
- Are you from Boston?
- Chicago.

218
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:02,300
- Where did you learn Japanese?
- Chicago.

219
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:05,400
Did you know the victim?

220
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:09,700
He was just in here drinking.

221
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:13,800
- Did you see the killer leave?
- Yeah, sure.

222
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,700
And he wrote his name on the back
of my dress and said to give it to you.

223
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,200
- Anything else?
- What are you busting my ass for?

224
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:27,200
Because you could get me killed.
There's a war going on here.

225
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:32,400
- What are you talking about?
- Between Sato and his old boss Sugai.

226
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:36,900
- Who knows about this?
- Counting you and me?

227
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:39,900
1 1 million.

228
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:50,200
- Did that woman tell you anything?
- Why would she? I'm just an observer.

229
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:55,700
Tell Ohashi I'll report to him
when he's ready to report to me.

230
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:02,000
- I'm a detective just like you.
- Bullshit, you're a suit.

231
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:07,000
Tell Ohashi
one good hand-job deserves another.

232
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:14,100
Charlie, get your map out.
Find the directions to the hotel.

233
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:17,000
- Don't you want a ride?
- We'll walk.

234
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:23,600
I want a complete file on Sato,
and a report on what happened here.

235
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:29,000
- Translate it by 09:00 tomorrow.
- Very well.

236
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:31,600
Thank you.

237
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:35,600
- Come on, Charlie.
- You will have a long walk.

238
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:41,000
If I get lost, we'll call a cop.

239
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,800
What?

240
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:58,100
I know he didn't fill us in
on the gang war, but I like the guy.

241
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:01,200
You told me it was four more blocks.

242
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:08,300
- You said we'd walk home.
- I don't know where the hotel is.

243
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:14,000
This isn't the time to ask you
what's going down with Oliver...

244
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:18,800
Some suits back home
think I cut a deal with Sato.

245
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,800
They're full of shit.
I'll back you up.

246
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,400
What's going on here?

247
00:36:56,500 --> 00:37:01,600
What? What?
What is your problem?

248
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,800
I don't know. We should cut our losses
and let the locals handle this one.

249
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:25,300
I can't go back without him.

250
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:36,700
Sato Kojo. He started as an enforcer
and rose quickly to minor boss.

251
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:42,000
He controls some of the docks
and some construction in Hawaii.

252
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,000
The victim last night
was one of Sato's guys.

253
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:53,500
And six hours earlier,
Sato put a hit on this guy...

254
00:37:55,700 --> 00:38:00,400
- Okada Genkuro, an artist.
- He's an engraver.

255
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:07,600
- 48 hours later he's in Scalari's.
- Who's this with Sato?

256
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:12,100
Sugai Kunio. Top Oyabun.

257
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:18,000
Like your Mafia bosses...
construction, gambling, extortion.

258
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:22,300
- What's Sugai doing with Sato?
- I don't know.

259
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:27,000
Even I know that Sato
used to work for Sugai.

260
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:31,300
Now they're knocking each other off
left and right.

261
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:34,800
These goddamn suits!

262
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:41,200
- What's with the SWATs out here?
- Exercise.

263
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:46,600
- Training perhaps.
- Come on, start cutting us in.

264
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:52,200
I can't figure out what was in
that box in Scalari's. Drugs?

265
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:58,400
No drugs. Steel, liquor, horses.

266
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:02,400
He owns part ofthe Club Miyako.

267
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,200
What's going on outside?

268
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:15,400
They have a tip
about Sato's last hideout.

269
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:18,500
- It's only a tip.
- It's only a tip?

270
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:22,100
I promise I'll keep you informed.

271
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:30,500
Could you find the file
on Sato's guy... Shinji Sekimitsu?

272
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:41,200
Please, I need authorisation.

273
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:45,500
No, it's a training exercise.

274
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,900
- Observers.
- You got it.

275
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,700
Observers.

276
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:10,000
Is that the guy from the airport?

277
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,200
That's him, right?

278
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,500
Easy, Nicky.

279
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,800
Hi, sweetheart.

280
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:45,800
You remember me, don't you?
Where's your boss?

281
00:41:56,100 --> 00:42:00,700
- I only want to talk to him.
- What are you doing?

282
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:04,600
This isn't New York.
We've got rules here.

283
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:09,200
I've seen Sato's work.
He ain't following your programme.

284
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:12,700
- You must have patience.
- Fuck patience.

285
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:30,200
He was here. I know it.

286
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,800
- We have to go.
- We're just observing.

287
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,900
Can I take a quick look?

288
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:46,500
Charlie.

289
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:58,600
- I got something.
- Mas is in deep shit now.

290
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:22,600
You don't want to eat that shit.
Give me a stick.

291
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:30,300
- Son of a bitch!
- I always said you were the best.

292
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,600
I owe you lunch.

293
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:06,800
Where's Mas?

294
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:12,300
Mas, we got good news for you.

295
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:16,000
What the fuck's his problem?

296
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:28,600
I will have no more to do with you.
Please, get out.

297
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:35,000
- I know you took a little heat...
- Ohashi is waiting for you.

298
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:39,200
- We'll square it.
- Let us explain what happened.

299
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:45,600
You have dishonoured me
and our department. You are a thief.

300
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:53,400
I saw you take the money.

301
00:45:56,100 --> 00:46:01,600
You saw me take the money...
I wanted to get things done.

302
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:06,300
I have informed Ohashi.
He informed your captain.

303
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:12,500
- We know what kind of man you are.
- You don't know one thing about me.

304
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:16,700
You and your self-righteous bullshit
will cost me my job.

305
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:28,100
If you pull it, you'd better use it.

306
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:36,400
Watch this, okay?
I only want to do this once.

307
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:44,500
Look, see how the impression
hardly leaves the ashes?

308
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:47,700
There wasn't enough pressure.

309
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:51,100
This is good, but this ain't money.

310
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:57,300
The box contained samples or plates,
and this is a counterfeiting war.

311
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:03,300
And you should talk to your partner
before you go to the suits.

312
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:06,100
We were going to cut you in.

313
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:42,400
Don't ever say you didn't have
a good time with Charlie Vincent.

314
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:53,100
You know the American girl,
is she around tonight?

315
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:59,000
Come here, baby. Join us.

316
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:02,000
Come on.

317
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:08,800
What is this?
It's still moving in my mouth.

318
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:15,200
I haven't taken the silverware,
so just take a hike.

319
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:19,800
Nicky, what are you doing?
Sit down. Join us.

320
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:25,300
Superintendent Ohashi would
like to see you in the morning.

321
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:33,800
Smoke a little peace pipe here.
We're all partners now.

322
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,700
Mas, please join us.
We'll have a good time.

323
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:42,600
- Come on.
- Thank you.

324
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:57,600
Conklin, I did my duty.
These are the men I work for.

325
00:48:57,700 --> 00:49:01,800
You talk to your partners
before you go to the suits.

326
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,800
You should think less of yourself
and more of your group.

327
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:10,300
Try to work like a Japanese.

328
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:14,500
I grew up with your soldiers.
You were wise then.

329
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:19,300
Now, music and movies
are all that America is good for.

330
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:24,200
We make the machines. We build
the future. We won the peace.

331
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:30,400
Not one of you guys
has ever had an original idea.

332
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:35,300
Are you guys
going to argue all the time?

333
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:41,900
What is this, a conspiracy
to fuck up my evening?

334
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:45,900
Mas, what are you doing?
It's good-time time.

335
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:50,000
- Kampaitime.
- Up and down.

336
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:13,600
Can I talk to you?

337
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:18,800
Look, I need your help.
I've got my tits in the wringer.

338
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,700
Just talk to me
for a couple of minutes.

339
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:28,700
Give that woman down there $50
and go where she takes you.

340
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:47,600
Show a little mercy,
some people are trying to eat.

341
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:51,700
- You like that stuff?
- Yes.

342
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:56,000
"That's Amore".
I was a teenager when it was new.

343
00:50:56,100 --> 00:51:00,100
I was a teenager when it was old.

344
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:05,000
If you're going to hang around with
NYPD, here's what you have to do.

345
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:10,000
Lose that tie, it's a fire hazard.
Here's a little gift.

346
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:15,100
Straight from the Big Apple,
from Charlie Vincent to you.

347
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,100
- Thanks.
- It's my honour.

348
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:24,800
I like you.

349
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:28,700
- Top drawer, yes?
- Top drawer.

350
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,400
Hey, meatball, what are you doing?
You can't hit a note.

351
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:40,300
- You could do better?
- Yes, I could do better.

352
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:44,600
- Put it up or shut it up.
- To you, from me.

353
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:54,500
- Thank you.
- Don't quit your day job.

354
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:06,600
That quick?
What's he talking about?

355
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:32,600
Ray Charles.

356
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,600
You and me.

357
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:40,200
Detective, wait.

358
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:44,700
Masahiro Matsumoto,
ladies and gentlemen.

359
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:12,100
Masahiro Matsumoto!

360
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:18,100
If you're looking for Sato,
I can't help you.

361
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:21,000
He hasn't been here in over a year.

362
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:25,600
- Who did he do regularly?
- Do you think I pay attention?

363
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:30,800
You'd recognise if one of your
customers had a different tie on.

364
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:39,900
He had a different girl every time.
I didn't know of anybody regular.

365
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:45,300
That's Sugai and the girl in sequins
is the one with blood on her hands.

366
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:49,600
- You did your homework.
- How do I get to him?

367
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:54,600
I've been living in this country
for seven years...

368
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:58,700
I still can't read the headlines.

369
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:01,400
How do I get to him?

370
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:06,200
Let the police handle it.
No one's going to help a gaijin.

371
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:12,200
A stranger. A foreigner.
Me and you... more you.

372
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:23,000
- Got to go.
- Hold on.

373
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:27,500
- Wrigley Field has lights now.
- Yeah, Mom told me.

374
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:33,000
Did she? Did she say it's not stupid
to be scared?

375
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:36,200
But sometimes
you've got to choose a side.

376
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:40,900
I did. I'm on my side.

377
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:14,200
- The drinks cost $1 25.
- How much was the fish?

378
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:18,300
- $200.
- Holy shit!

379
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:22,500
How much would it have been
if it was cooked? Did you pay?

380
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:28,900
No, Matsumoto signed it over
to the Osaka Police Department.

381
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:33,100
That's the best thing
he's done for us. You like the guy?

382
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:37,700
- Mas? He's okay.
- Who the hell's this?

383
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:47,700
I can't figure this place out.

384
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:53,300
You want to play?
You and me, come on.

385
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:55,600
Right here.
