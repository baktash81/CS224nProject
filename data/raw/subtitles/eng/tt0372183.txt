1
00:00:44,177 --> 00:00:47,510
This is not a drill, soldier.

2
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:49,810
We clear on that?

3
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:54,945
This is a live project.
You're a go.

4
00:00:55,021 --> 00:00:58,286
You're a go.

5
00:00:58,358 --> 00:01:01,725
Training is over.
Training is over.

6
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:03,820
Training is over.
Training is over.

7
00:01:50,376 --> 00:01:53,368
I ' m okay. It's fine.

8
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:56,176
Just a headache.

9
00:02:01,354 --> 00:02:05,222
You're burning up.

10
00:02:18,371 --> 00:02:20,305
It's okay.

11
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,909
Just a headache.

12
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:47,890
Anything new?
No.

13
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:51,960
It's just bits and pieces.

14
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:56,704
I can hear Conklin's voice,

15
00:02:56,776 --> 00:03:00,837
and there's that photograph, but...

16
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:05,010
I just can't stay with it.

17
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:07,348
But you’re sure it's not
just a bad dream?
It happened.

18
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,752
It was a mission.

19
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:13,916
And I was there.

20
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:17,156
You should write it down.

21
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:22,567
Two years we're scribbling
in that notebook--
It hasn't been two years.

22
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:25,900
It's always bad, and now it's just
the same thing over and over again.

23
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:31,433
But that's why we write it down.
Because sooner or later,
you remember something good.

24
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:36,705
I do remember something good.

25
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:38,978
All the time.

26
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:42,612
- I want one final go around.
- All teams listen up.

27
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:46,516
- We are standing by for final green.
- Survey Two,
I need to know when you've got eyes.

28
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:50,989
- This is Survey Two. I have eyes.
- Copy that.

29
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:55,323
Survey One, this is Hub.
Do you have visual contact?

30
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:59,854
Hub, this is Survey One.
Mobile One is in motion.

31
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:08,836
Survey Three, that is good.

32
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:12,708
Hub.
Director Marshal I from Langley.

33
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:14,542
- Langley.
- Stand by, please.

34
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:20,652
- Martin?
- I'm here. So is Donnie and Jack Weller.

35
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,315
We understand you're using
the full allocation for this buy.

36
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,551
It's where we came out.
It's a lot of money, Pam.

37
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:32,428
For a thief, a mole. If it does nothing more
than narrow the list of suspects,
it's a bargain at 1 0 times the price.

38
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:35,763
Hub, this is Survey Two.
Escort is breaking off..

39
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:38,497
Mobile One is entering the building.

40
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:42,667
Gentlemen, I have the seller on-site
and in play. Quite frankly,
there's nothing much more to discuss.

41
00:05:49,148 --> 00:05:52,049
- All right, Pam. Your call.
- Go.

42
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:54,109
- We're on.
- Audio contact only.

43
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:57,179
Switching to channel one now.

44
00:05:57,256 --> 00:05:59,087
Copy that. It's affirmative.

45
00:06:58,818 --> 00:07:01,218
Hub, Mobile One and seller
have entered the office.

46
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:02,777
Copy that.

47
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:19,599
This is everything?

48
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:56,341
Those were shots.

49
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:05,214
Survey One, come in.
Survey One, I need to know
what happened. What do you see?

50
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:07,309
- Do you see any shadows? I see nothing.
- What is your visual?

51
00:08:07,386 --> 00:08:11,322
- Get some men in there.
Get some men in there right now.
- Pull it up, Kurt.

52
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:15,685
Eye contact. I don't care if it's visual--
Mobile One, can you copy, please?

53
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:18,696
- Are you there, Mobile One?
- I'm sorry.

54
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:23,201
What do you see?

55
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:42,379
...Petroleum Association's annual
conference here in Berlin...

56
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:45,447
is Pekos Oil chief executive officer
Yuri Gretkov.

57
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:50,053
In just six years, Gretkov has turned
Pekos into an oil empire, which in turn--

58
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:57,564
He's become one of
the wealthiest men in Russia...

59
00:08:57,637 --> 00:09:01,198
after consolidating drilling rights
in the Caspian Sea and gaining control
of one of the wo--

60
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,624
How much?

61
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:32,249
Good morning, sir.
Morning.

62
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:36,821
He is my friend.
There's been a death in the family.

63
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:40,086
I wonder if you’ve seen him.

64
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:25,430
- Hey.
- Get in.

65
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:27,495
- What's wrong?
- We're blown.

66
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:30,508
How?
We pushed it.
We got lazy.

67
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:45,155
Idiot!

68
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:50,826
All right. That's twice now
I've seen the same guy.

69
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:52,887
I saw him in town.
He was at the telegraph office.

70
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:55,297
Are you sure?
How-How can you be sure?
It's just wrong.

71
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:58,200
The guy, the car he's driving,
what he's wearing-- it's just wrong.

72
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:05,004
Look, Jason, let's stay calm.
It could be anybody. This is real.

73
00:14:05,077 --> 00:14:08,706
This is real. That's him.
That's him right there.

74
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:11,773
Get your head down.
Silver Hyundai. Get your head down.

75
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:33,268
How far is he?

76
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:37,765
How far?

77
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:41,043
A hundred meters.

78
00:14:58,864 --> 00:15:00,957
Here, take the wheel.
You're gonna drive.

79
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:04,829
Switch.

80
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:09,230
Just head to the bridge.

81
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,785
- Turn here.
Cut through the field.
- Hang on.

82
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:22,679
All right, you keep going to the shack.
I'll meet you there in one hour.

83
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:26,081
I'm gonna bail out on the other side of this bridge.
It's the only way he can follow us.

84
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,483
What if it’s not who you think it is?
It's them. It's Treadstone.

85
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:31,045
Jason, don't do it.
Look, Marie, I warned 'em.

86
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:33,421
I don't want you to do it.
I told them what would happen
if they didn't leave us alone.

87
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:37,155
- It's never gonna be over like this.
I don't want--
- We don't have a choice.

88
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:39,197
Yes, you do.

89
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,802
Thank you.

90
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:03,865
Two of these explosive charges
placed on the power lines,
and one of them failed.

91
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:06,001
The fingerprints from the one
that didn't go off.

92
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:08,205
- And the Germans can't match it?
- No. Nobody's got it.

93
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:12,683
We checked out every database we could access.
But we're hooked into Langley now.

94
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:15,083
Run it.
Okay.

95
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:26,397
What the hell's Treadstone?

96
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:31,994
All right. Get me a flight.
We're going to Langley.

97
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:09,417
Two men dead,
three million in cash gone,
no Neski files,

98
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:11,394
and all very public.

99
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:14,591
This is still a clandestine agency, no?

100
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,600
I don't view this event
as a failure.

101
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:19,364
You call it a success?
We have a lead.

102
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:23,431
A fingerprint left by the assassin.
He's one of us.

103
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:28,872
- Who is it?
- What can you tell me
about Treadstone?

104
00:22:28,947 --> 00:22:32,906
Treadstone?
It's where the trail dead-ends.

105
00:22:32,984 --> 00:22:35,919
If you want an answer,
you're going to have to give me...

106
00:22:35,987 --> 00:22:39,218
a level-five S.C.I. access.

107
00:22:41,827 --> 00:22:43,795
We have a lead, Marty.

108
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:49,923
All right.
You've got your clearance.

109
00:22:50,001 --> 00:22:53,630
But you're on
a very short leash.

110
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:57,732
And you'll give a full report
to the group. I wanna know
where you’re going with this.

111
00:22:57,809 --> 00:23:00,437
Sir.

112
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:19,317
Ward?

113
00:24:19,391 --> 00:24:21,052
Yes?
Pamela Landy.

114
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:23,526
Hey, Pam.
What can I do for you?

115
00:24:23,595 --> 00:24:26,086
I was hoping you had
some time for me.
Time for what?

116
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:31,466
- I'm free right now, actually.
- That sounds ominous.
Let me check my schedule.

117
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:38,498
Excuse me.
I need to, uh--
Excuse me. Can I help you?

118
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:40,841
Yeah, I'm here to see Mr. Abbott.
Twenty minutes?

119
00:24:40,912 --> 00:24:43,710
See ya.

120
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:53,914
Operation Treadstone.
Never heard of it.

121
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:58,759
That's not gonna fly.
With all due respect, Pam, I think you
might've wandered past your pay grade.

122
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:03,494
That's a warrant from Director Marshall
granting me unrestricted access to...

123
00:25:03,568 --> 00:25:06,537
all personnel and materials
associated with Treadstone.

124
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:13,033
So, what are we looking at?
I wanna know about it.

125
00:25:13,111 --> 00:25:16,103
Know about it?
It was a kill squad.
Black-on-black.

126
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:20,675
We closed it down two years ago.
Nobody wants to know about Treadstone.
Not around here.

127
00:25:20,752 --> 00:25:24,415
So I think you better take this
back to Marty and let him know
exactly what you’re doing.

128
00:25:24,489 --> 00:25:28,687
He does.
I've been down to the archives.
I have the files, Ward.

129
00:25:30,428 --> 00:25:33,124
- Let's talk about Conklin.
- What are you after, Pam?

130
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:36,759
You wanna fry me?
You want my desk. Is that it?

131
00:25:36,835 --> 00:25:38,632
I wanna know what happened.
What happened?

132
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:43,697
Jason Bourne happened.
You got the files.
Then let's cut the crap.

133
00:25:43,775 --> 00:25:47,768
Conklin had these guys wound so tight,
they were bound to snap.

134
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:53,040
Bourne was his number-one.
The guy went for a job, screwed the op,
never came back.

135
00:25:53,118 --> 00:25:58,215
Conklin couldn't fix it,
couldn't find Bourne, couldn't adjust.
It all went sideways.

136
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:01,555
So you had Conklin killed?
I mean, if we're cutting the crap.

137
00:26:01,626 --> 00:26:04,117
I've given 30 years
and two marriages to this agency.

138
00:26:04,195 --> 00:26:07,096
I've shoveled shit on four continents.
I'm due to retire next year.

139
00:26:07,165 --> 00:26:10,157
But if you think I'm gonna sit here
and let you dangle me with this,

140
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:13,727
you can go to hell... and Marshall too.

141
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:17,469
It had to be done.

142
00:26:17,542 --> 00:26:20,340
- And Bourne? Where is he now?
- Dead in a ditch.

143
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:23,108
- Drunk in a bar in Mogadishu.
Who knows?
- I think I do.

144
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:25,649
I had a deal going down
in Berlin last week.

145
00:26:25,717 --> 00:26:28,345
During the buy, both our case officer
and the seller were killed.

146
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:31,480
They were killed by Jason Bourne.

147
00:26:34,826 --> 00:26:36,760
They're ready for us upstairs.

148
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:22,035
Seven years ago,
$20 million of C.I.A. funds disappeared
during a wire transfer through Moscow.

149
00:27:22,107 --> 00:27:27,545
In the investigation that followed,
we were contacted by
a Russian politician, Vladimir Neski.

150
00:27:27,612 --> 00:27:31,605
Neski claimed we had a leak
and that we'd been ripped off
by one of our own.

151
00:27:31,683 --> 00:27:34,049
And were we?
We never found out.

152
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:36,417
We were negotiating a meet
with Mr. Neski when he was killed.

153
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:38,456
- By who?
- His wife.

154
00:27:38,523 --> 00:27:41,185
The case had gone cold until a month ago
when we found a source.

155
00:27:41,259 --> 00:27:44,820
Another Russian in Berlin
who claimed to have access
to the Neski murder files.

156
00:27:44,896 --> 00:27:47,023
We thought we had
another bite at the apple.

157
00:27:50,301 --> 00:27:54,499
Turns out the assassin
was one of our own--Jason Bourne.

158
00:27:55,774 --> 00:27:58,766
I know Treadstone's not
a very popular subject around here,

159
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:01,368
but we found some interesting things
when we dug a little deeper.

160
00:28:01,446 --> 00:28:04,847
This is Conklin's personal computer.

161
00:28:04,916 --> 00:28:10,377
His Treadstone files are bloated
with code keys and case files that
he neither needed nor had clearance for.

162
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:14,448
Buried in the hard drive,
we found a deleted file with
an account number to a bank in Zurich.

163
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:20,260
At the time of his death,
he was sitting on a personal account
in the amount of$760,000.

164
00:28:20,331 --> 00:28:25,064
You know what his budget was?
We were throwing money at him
and asking him to keep it dark.

165
00:28:25,136 --> 00:28:28,128
- It was his own account.
He was up to something.
-This is supposed to be definitive?

166
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:31,107
What's definitive is that
I just lost two people in Berlin.
So what's your theory?

167
00:28:31,176 --> 00:28:35,738
Conklin's reaching out from the grave
to protect his good name?
The man is dead.

168
00:28:35,814 --> 00:28:39,079
- No one's disputing that, Ward.
- For Christ's sake, Marty, you knew Conklin.

169
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:43,109
Does this scan? I mean, at all?

170
00:28:43,188 --> 00:28:45,122
Cut to the chase, Pam.

171
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:47,522
I think that Bourne and Conklin
were in business together,

172
00:28:47,592 --> 00:28:50,755
that Bourne's still involved
and that whatever information
I was trying to buy in Berlin...

173
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:53,821
was big enough to bring Bourne
out from hiding to kill again.

174
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:56,059
How's that scan?

175
00:28:57,035 --> 00:28:58,969
Excuse me, sir,
but you’re not gonna believe this.

176
00:28:59,037 --> 00:29:02,006
Jason Bourne's passport
just popped up on the grid in Naples.

177
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:09,111
Okay. Contact Naples.
They need to know
who they're dealing with.

178
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:12,946
Find out what kind of local assets
we have in place there.

179
00:29:17,655 --> 00:29:20,647
Nah, it's nothing. Some guy's name
came up on the computer.

180
00:29:23,128 --> 00:29:26,962
Yeah. Hey, listen, Tom,
I'm gonna call you back, okay?

181
00:29:27,031 --> 00:29:29,329
All right.

182
00:29:44,349 --> 00:29:47,182
Mr. Bourne, I'm John Nevins.
I'm with the U.S. Consulate.

183
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:49,652
I just have a few questions for you.

184
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:02,631
You're coming out of Tangier.
Is that correct?

185
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,303
What's the, uh, nature
of your visit to Naples?

186
00:30:33,865 --> 00:30:38,029
Look, I don't know what you did,
and I don't know
who you’re working for.

187
00:30:38,102 --> 00:30:40,036
But I promise you this--

188
00:30:40,104 --> 00:30:43,096
you're gonna play ball
one way or the other.

189
00:30:50,615 --> 00:30:53,914
This is Nevins.

190
00:30:53,985 --> 00:30:57,182
This is Tom Cronin, C.I. Operations Officer
calling from Langley, Virginia.

191
00:30:57,255 --> 00:31:00,691
- Do you have a Jason Bourne in custody?
- Yes, I do.

192
00:31:00,758 --> 00:31:03,454
Listen, he's an agency priority target.

193
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:08,363
Call me back
as soon as he's secure.
I understand.

194
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:55,844
He's been detained.
Here's the number.

195
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:58,906
He's being interrogated by
a field officer out of the consulate.

196
00:32:12,897 --> 00:32:16,264
- Hello.
- This is Pamela Landy, C.I. supervisor.

197
00:32:16,334 --> 00:32:18,928
Where do we stand?

198
00:32:19,003 --> 00:32:21,801
I, uh, think he got away.

199
00:32:21,873 --> 00:32:24,603
Damn it.

200
00:32:24,676 --> 00:32:28,339
- Have you locked down the area?
- Locked it down? No. No.

201
00:32:28,413 --> 00:32:31,473
This is, uh-- This is Italy.
They don't exactly lock down--

202
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:34,985
- How long have you
worked for the agency?
- Me? For four years.

203
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:39,854
If you ever wanna make it to five,
you're gonna listen to me real close.
Bourne is armed and extremely dangerous.

204
00:32:39,924 --> 00:32:43,223
Last week in Berlin
he assassinated two men--
one a highly experienced field officer.

205
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:46,525
I want you to secure that area.
I want any evidence secured,
and I want it done right now.

206
00:32:46,597 --> 00:32:48,997
Is that clear?
Yes, sir-- ma'am.

207
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:52,468
I'm getting on a plane to Berlin
in 45 minutes, which means
you're gonna call me back in 30.

208
00:32:52,537 --> 00:32:55,131
And when I ask you where west and,
I had better be impressed.

209
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:02,072
- Berlin?
- I already have a team in place there.

210
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:04,740
I doubt that Bourne's in Naples
ready to start a family.

211
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:07,410
- You have no idea
what you're getting into.
- Do you have any idea?

212
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:10,852
From the minute he left Treadstone,
he's killed and eluded every single person
that you’ve sent to find him.

213
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:14,414
You read a couple of files on Jason Bourne,
and that makes you an expert?
This is my case, Ward.

214
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:18,155
Enough. I want you both
on that plane.

215
00:33:18,229 --> 00:33:22,427
We are, all of us, going to do
what we were either too lazy
or inept to do the last time around.

216
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,663
We're gonna find this son of a bitch
and take him down.

217
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:29,332
I 'm not having Jason Bourne
destroy any more of this agency.

218
00:33:29,407 --> 00:33:33,366
- Is that definitive enough for you?
- Yes.

219
00:33:36,748 --> 00:33:40,081
Jason Bourne
is armed and extremely dangerous.

220
00:33:40,151 --> 00:33:43,882
Last week in Berlin
he assassinated two men--
one a highly experienced field officer.

221
00:33:43,955 --> 00:33:45,650
I want that area--

222
00:33:45,723 --> 00:33:48,385
...he assassinated two men--
one a highly experienced field officer.

223
00:33:48,459 --> 00:33:52,122
I want that area secured.
I want any evidence secured,
and I want it done right now--

224
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:13,676
This is not a drill, soldier.

225
00:34:17,688 --> 00:34:21,180
This is not a drill, soldier.
This is not a drill, soldier.

226
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:25,089
We clear on that?
We clear on that?

227
00:35:38,836 --> 00:35:41,396
You'd been working at Treadstone
for three years,

228
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:43,406
and your cover at the time was what?

229
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:46,170
That I was an American student in Paris.

230
00:35:46,244 --> 00:35:49,179
And what exactly did your job
with Treadstone in Paris consist of?

231
00:35:49,247 --> 00:35:52,978
I had two responsibilities.
One was to coordinate
logistical operations.

232
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:55,211
The other was to monitor
the health of the agents.

233
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:57,754
Health, meaning what?
Their mental health.

234
00:35:57,822 --> 00:36:00,757
- Because of what they had been through,
they were prone to a variety of problems.
- What kind?

235
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:04,818
Depression, anger,
compulsive behaviors.

236
00:36:04,896 --> 00:36:08,832
They had physical symptoms.
Headaches, sensitivity to light.

237
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:11,232
- Amnesia?
- Before Bourne? No.

238
00:36:16,474 --> 00:36:19,637
The plane's ready.
There's a car waiting for you.

239
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:21,701
- Good luck.
- No. You were his local contact.

240
00:36:21,779 --> 00:36:25,340
You were with him the night Conklin died.
You're coming with us.

241
00:37:27,011 --> 00:37:32,677
Langley pulled an image out of Naples.
It's uploading right now.

242
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,513
It's coming in now.

243
00:37:35,653 --> 00:37:38,451
- I need clearance.
- He's not hiding, that's for sure.

244
00:37:38,522 --> 00:37:40,956
- Why Naples? Why now?
- Could be random.

245
00:37:41,025 --> 00:37:43,118
- Maybe he's running.
- On his own passport?

246
00:37:43,194 --> 00:37:45,856
- What is he actually doing?
- He's making his first mistake.

247
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,659
It's not a mistake.

248
00:37:48,899 --> 00:37:52,232
They don't make mistakes.
They don't do random.

249
00:37:52,303 --> 00:37:54,794
There's always an objective.
Always a target.

250
00:37:54,872 --> 00:37:57,363
The objective and targets
always came from us.
Who's giving them to him now?

251
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:59,773
Scary version?

252
00:37:59,844 --> 00:38:02,176
He is.

253
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:05,002
- I emptied it.
- It felt a little light.

254
00:39:05,076 --> 00:39:06,771
Put it down.

255
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:17,077
- Front.
- Sorry. Old habits.

256
00:39:19,423 --> 00:39:22,085
Use your teeth.
Ah.

257
00:39:32,737 --> 00:39:35,672
Word in the ether was
you'd lost your memory.

258
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,731
You still should've moved.

259
00:39:40,745 --> 00:39:43,578
- What do you want?
- Conklin.

260
00:39:43,647 --> 00:39:45,581
He's dead.

261
00:39:45,649 --> 00:39:50,382
Shot dead in Paris.
Dead the night you walked out.
So who's running Treadstone now?

262
00:39:50,454 --> 00:39:54,049
Nobody. They shut it down.

263
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:58,152
It's over. We're the last two.

264
00:40:03,033 --> 00:40:05,228
If it’s over,
then why are they still after me?

265
00:40:05,302 --> 00:40:07,930
- I don't know.
- Ever heard the name Pamela Landy?

266
00:40:08,005 --> 00:40:11,236
- I don't know who that is.
- Pamela Landy and Berlin.
What's going on in Berlin?

267
00:40:11,308 --> 00:40:14,141
I don't know.

268
00:40:14,211 --> 00:40:16,702
Why would I lie?

269
00:40:40,237 --> 00:40:42,432
I thought you were here to kill me.

270
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:49,205
What'd you do?
I'm sorry.

271
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,373
Did you call it in?

272
00:40:54,852 --> 00:40:57,377
Get up. Come on.

273
00:41:00,558 --> 00:41:03,891
You have a car out front?
The keys are in
my coat pocket.

274
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:05,895
But we should--
What?

275
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:08,363
Go out the back.
I have another car.

276
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:44,401
Pamela Landy.

277
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:50,143
Nein, mein Herr.
Danke.

278
00:45:55,886 --> 00:45:59,583
Pamela Landy.

279
00:45:59,656 --> 00:46:01,954
Nein.

280
00:46:10,234 --> 00:46:11,929
Pamela Landy, bitte.

281
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:16,637
Ja.

282
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:51,471
Pamela Landy, please.
One moment, please.

283
00:46:51,542 --> 00:46:55,205
Thank you.

284
00:46:55,279 --> 00:46:58,271
I wanted to call a guest.
Pamela Landy.

285
00:46:58,348 --> 00:47:01,249
Just one second, please.

286
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:04,481
Hello?

287
00:47:05,455 --> 00:47:08,583
Hello?

288
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:13,392
I'm sorry, sir.
The phone's busy right now.
Just try later. Thank you.

289
00:48:00,811 --> 00:48:04,212
Okay. Let's take a look at the timeline.
What's Bourne's objective?

290
00:48:04,281 --> 00:48:06,909
Now, I wanna break this out
in boxes.

291
00:48:06,984 --> 00:48:10,920
Naples outbound. Check everything.
Flights, trains, police reports.
That's box one.

292
00:48:10,988 --> 00:48:12,785
- T eddy, that's yours.
- Got it.

293
00:48:15,993 --> 00:48:18,427
Box number two.
Call it "prior connections. "

294
00:48:18,495 --> 00:48:21,225
I want to rerun al I Bourne's
Treadstone material. Every footstep.

295
00:48:23,867 --> 00:48:26,631
Kim, box three.
I want to identify his method of travel.

296
00:48:26,703 --> 00:48:29,263
Stay on the local cops.
We need a vehicle, a parking ticket,
something.

297
00:48:29,339 --> 00:48:33,901
Langley's offered to upload
any satellite imaging we need,
so let's find a target for them.

298
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:40,611
Danny, box four. I need fresh eyes.
Review the buy where
we lost the Neski files.

299
00:48:40,684 --> 00:48:45,348
Timeline it with what we know
about Bourne's movements.
Turn it upside down and see what we find.

300
00:48:47,691 --> 00:48:52,424
Come on, guys. We ran this guy's life
with total control for all those years.
We should be a step ahead of him.

301
00:48:52,496 --> 00:48:55,158
You wanna go home?
Find Jason Bourne.

302
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:18,952
- Pamela Landy.
- This is Jason Bourne.

303
00:49:20,691 --> 00:49:23,558
- Bourne?
- It's Bourne. We need 90 seconds
to triangulate his position.

304
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:26,027
What do you want?

305
00:49:28,198 --> 00:49:30,860
Are you running Treadstone?

306
00:49:34,037 --> 00:49:37,165
Treadstone was closed down
two years ago. You know that.

307
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:39,834
Then who's planning
the missions now?

308
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:43,277
There are no missions. It's over.

309
00:49:44,915 --> 00:49:48,180
- Then what do you want with me?
- Berlin.

310
00:49:50,754 --> 00:49:53,518
Have you forgotten
what happened in Berlin?

311
00:49:54,925 --> 00:49:58,258
You killed two people, Bourne.
You killed two people, Bourne.

312
00:49:58,328 --> 00:50:00,990
You killed two people, Bourne.

313
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:07,163
Neski-- Vladimir Neski--
Vladimir Neski--

314
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:17,740
Bourne?

315
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:22,246
I wanna come in.

316
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:28,458
- Okay. How do you wanna do it?
- We need 35 seconds.

317
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:33,258
- I need someone I know to bring me in.
- Who?

318
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:36,299
There was a girl in Paris.
She was part of the program.

319
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:41,728
She used to handle logistics.
Alexander Strasse, 30 minutes,
under the World Clock.

320
00:50:41,805 --> 00:50:44,968
Send her alone.
Give her your phone.

321
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:47,602
What if I can't find her?

322
00:50:47,677 --> 00:50:50,805
It's easy.
She's standing right next to you.

323
00:51:04,795 --> 00:51:07,389
- There's just so many areas--
- It's a very simple layout.

324
00:51:08,465 --> 00:51:10,330
Get the second quadrant.
Pull it out.

325
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:13,836
Where is it?
Get the second quadrant, please.
Pull it all the way up.

326
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:16,668
Clock is right here--
Shit, he's put her in the middle of everything.

327
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:19,675
This is a security nightmare.
There is no way we are going to
get her covered--

328
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:23,611
Call a Mayday into Berlin station.
We need snipers, D.O.D.,
whatever they've got.

329
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:27,810
No snipers. You put snipers
on the roof and it'll scare him off,
and I need answers.

330
00:51:27,884 --> 00:51:32,082
- You can't really believe
he wants to come in.
- He knows something about the Neski case.

331
00:51:32,155 --> 00:51:35,955
- I'm not gonna pass up this chance
to find out what it is.
- Don't be a fool. Not when we're this close.

332
00:51:36,026 --> 00:51:38,187
Are we talking about protecting Nicky
or killing Bourne?

333
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:43,255
- We're talking about killing Bourne.
- We're talking about the next dead body.
It might be Nicky. It will be someone.

334
00:51:43,333 --> 00:51:45,699
You're not hearing me.
Bourne dead gives me nothing.

335
00:51:49,039 --> 00:51:51,837
Can I talk to you privately?

336
00:51:57,147 --> 00:51:59,809
- What?
- I know how you’re feeling.

337
00:51:59,883 --> 00:52:02,511
You lost two men in Berlin
and you want it to mean something.

338
00:52:02,586 --> 00:52:04,577
But nothing Bourne gives you
will bring your men back.

339
00:52:04,654 --> 00:52:09,057
Nothing in those files
makes their sacrifice worthwhile.
You have to let go.

340
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:12,721
We're professionals.
When an operation goes bad, we tie it off.

341
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:16,960
If there’s something you're not
telling me, I want it now before I send
that girl out there. Do you understand?

342
00:52:20,303 --> 00:52:23,272
You talk about this stuff
like you read it in a book.

343
00:52:37,554 --> 00:52:39,647
What do you want to do?

344
00:52:40,724 --> 00:52:43,386
Put the snipers in place.

345
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:46,623
If things go bad,
we take him out.

346
00:52:46,696 --> 00:52:48,493
You got it.

347
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:31,166
Hub, this is Survey One.
We have a crowd moving in.

348
00:53:31,241 --> 00:53:35,473
- It's some sort of protest march.
- I'm sorry. This is as close as I can get.

349
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:39,481
- Survey Two, can you get in any closer?
- Kurt, make sure the south end is covered.

350
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:42,518
Roger. Affirmative. Copy that.

351
00:53:56,666 --> 00:54:01,228
Hello.
There's a tram coming towards you.
Get on it.

352
00:54:01,304 --> 00:54:04,171
- She's moving to the tram.
- Where's it going?

353
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:07,335
The tram is going
to Alexanderplatz Station.

354
00:54:12,315 --> 00:54:15,842
Survey Five, I can't see him.
I don't see him.

355
00:54:19,823 --> 00:54:22,383
Hub, this is Survey Two,
she's getting on a tram.

356
00:54:22,459 --> 00:54:24,518
- She's getting on the tram.
- Zoom in on the tram.

357
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:27,256
- Bourne's on the tram.
- I don't think he's on the tram.

358
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:29,730
He's on the tram.

359
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:35,002
Send them in to follow.
Tell them to keep their distance.

360
00:54:35,071 --> 00:54:37,039
Okay, Delta, let's go.
Get on it.

361
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:40,406
Come on. Let's go.

362
00:54:40,477 --> 00:54:44,106
- Tell her to hurry.
- There's nothing on the south side.

363
00:54:59,162 --> 00:55:02,256
Alexanderplatz Station,
25 seconds.
