My daughter's under here.
Please.

1085
01:23:14,702 --> 01:23:16,037

- Three, four...
- Faster!

1096
01:23:45,233 --> 01:23:47,276
Five, six, seven, eight,

1097
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:48,778

1105
01:24:22,103 --> 01:24:23,354
It's okay.

1106
01:24:23,437 --> 01:24:24,730
- He's gonna be okay.
- Come on.

1107
01:24:24,814 --> 01:24:26,107
He's breathing.

1108
01:24:26,190 --> 01:24:28,651
We gotta get him
out of here. Rick!

1109
01:24:30,152 --> 01:24:32,655
Mom, he's gonna make it.

1110

- This good?
- That's perfect.

1114
01:24:52,967 --> 01:24:55,678
As soon as more people come,
we need to get them registered.

1115
01:24:55,761 --> 01:24:56,971
- I can do that.
- Okay.

1116
01:24:57,054 --> 01:24:58,472
We need to call
the power company,

1117
01:24:58,556 --> 01:24:59,807
get them to shut
the grid down.

1118
01:24:59,890 --> 01:25:02,268
I can do that...

1119
01:25:02,351 --> 01:25:04,729
as soon as we get service.

1120
01:25:08,691 --> 01:25:11,360
She's gotta get to a hospital.

1121
01:25:11,444 --> 01:25:12,987
Can you take them?

1122
01:25:13,070 --> 01:25:14,989
I need to look for Peyton.

01:25:15,072 --> 01:25:16,365
You're not coming?

1124
01:25:16,449 --> 01:25:17,742
I'm gonna keep looking
for Peyton.

1125
01:25:17,825 --> 01:25:20,202

You can fill that out.

01:34:44,433 --> 01:34:47,186
Hey, he's gonna
make it, right?

1236

- Are you--
- I'm her son.

1237
01:34:49,271 --> 01:34:50,772
No.

1238
01:34:56,737 --> 01:34:58,572
No, he is not.

1239
01:35:17,341 --> 01:35:19,468

Excuse me, I'm gonna ask you
to fill out this form for me

1245
01:35:54,253 --> 01:35:56,088
and get it back to me
as soon as you can.

1246
01:35:58,799 --> 01:35:59,800
Si.

Huh?

1252
01:37:03,405 --> 01:37:05,782
No, I'm-- I'm fine.

1253
01:37:10,787 --> 01:37:12,789
Is he undocumented?

1254
01:37:18,128 --> 01:37:20,464
Will they send him back?

1255
01:37:22,591 --> 01:37:25,010
Will they help him first if I--

1256
01:37:25,093 --> 01:37:26,887
Yes, yes.

1257
01:37:26,970 --> 01:37:29,097
But even so,
there will be costs.

1258
01:37:31,308 --> 01:37:34,061
You need to know
it could be a lot.

1259
01:37:34,144 --> 01:37:36,229
I understand.

1260
01:37:36,313 --> 01:37:38,607
Okay. I'll be right back.
