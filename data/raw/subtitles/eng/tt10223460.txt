00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,241
{\an8}<i>All right,
let's do it again from the top.</i>

3
00:00:32,406 --> 00:00:33,742
<i>We can cue music.</i>

4
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:36,161
<i>Marry me, marry me, say yes</i>

5
00:00:36,245 --> 00:00:38,372
<i>Marry me, marry me, say yes</i>

6
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:39,915
{\an8}<i>Marry me, marry me</i>

7
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:42,125
{\an8}<i>Say yes, for the rest
The rest</i>

8
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:44,336
{\an8}<i>I never seen forever
Oh, yeah</i>

9
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:46,755
{\an8}<i>I never seen forever
In the wild</i>

10
00:00:46,839 --> 00:00:51,260
{\an8}<i>But now I'm lookin'
Now I'm lookin' in its eyes...</i>

11
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:54,179
<i>Tomorrow night,
superstar Kat Valdez</i>

12
00:00:54,263 --> 00:00:57,391
<i>and Grammy-winning
hot, hot, hot Bastian</i>

13
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:59,643
<i>will make history
when they perform</i>

14
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:03,063
{\an8}<i>their new hit song</i> Marry Me
<i>and exchange vows</i>

15
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:07,526
{\an8}<i>in front of the whole world.
20 million people.</i>

16
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:09,069
See you tomorrow.

17
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:10,863
I'll be the one in the veil.

18
00:01:10,946 --> 00:01:13,532
And guess who's gonna be
one of them. Me!

19
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:17,327
Okay, I hear that
she is wearing a Zuhair Murad custom gown

20
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:19,913
<i>with 10,000
hand-beaded crystals.</i>

21
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,915
I feel so grateful right now

22
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:23,166
<i>that everything
is the way it is.</i>

23
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,835
<i>I have a beautiful fiance</i>

24
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:26,712
{\an8}who's so supportive
and loving and...

25
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:28,505
{\an8}I feel so grateful
for the American fans because

26
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:30,340
{\an8}<i>they are supporting me and Kat
in a very nice way.</i>

27
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:32,176
<i>Marry Me</i> is sweeping the country.

28
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:35,053
<i>Planning the wedding show
has been insane.</i>

29
00:01:35,137 --> 00:01:36,680
Strike that, the world.

30
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,974
Kat Valdez and Bastian
are taking their vows onstage

31
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:40,809
<i>in New York City tomorrow night,</i>

32
00:01:40,893 --> 00:01:42,603
{\an8}<i>and then jetting off
to a private island</i>

33
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:45,939
{\an8}<i>where they'll make,
let's hope, more beautiful music together.</i>

34
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:47,191
{\an8}<i>City National Bank,</i>

35
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:49,568
<i>bank of the stars,
presents</i> Marry Me.

36
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:52,905
The end of a tour
and the beginning of a lifetime.

37
00:01:52,988 --> 00:01:55,449
And with me is Colin Calloway,
her manager. How are you?

38
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:56,825
I'm very well, Justin.
How are you?

39
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:59,620
I'm good. Now, I heard
this was all Bastian's idea.

40
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:02,956
Uh, no, no no, they both
wanted to give something back to the fans.

41
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,126
You know, combined, they have
a social reach of over 200 million people?

42
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:07,878
Uh, yeah, of course I know that.
I'm the manager.

43
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,963
-Who's her bridesmaid?
-Uh...

44
00:02:10,214 --> 00:02:12,132
What about her exes?
Will they be in the audience?

45
00:02:12,216 --> 00:02:13,550
They got some people,
uh, waiting for me,

46
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:14,968
-so I'm just gonna go and deal with that.
-Just...

47
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:16,303
Bye, guys.

48
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:17,513
I hate dealing with managers.

49
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:19,181
<i>Marry me</i>

50
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,183
<i>I want you in my life
So bad</i>

51
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:23,143
<i>Ma-ma-ma, ma-ma-ma
Ma-ma-ma</i>

52
00:02:23,227 --> 00:02:24,561
<i>Marry me</i>

53
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,231
Can somebody get this cart?

54
00:02:27,523 --> 00:02:28,899
Can somebody help me?

55
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,654
It's a gift from Pasquale Bruni.

56
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:35,447
I mean, if you don't
like it, I'll take it.

57
00:02:35,531 --> 00:02:36,990
-Ah, that's beautiful.
-Oh!

58
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:40,536
Um, let's pack it
for the honeymoon.

59
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:41,870
-Okay.
-Okay?

60
00:02:41,954 --> 00:02:43,747
Oh, more flowers.

61
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:45,707
My God, this is insane.

62
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:47,835
This is nothing.
There's a moving van on Park

63
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:49,670
stuffed with wedding gifts,
including a stove.

64
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:52,464
-Someone got me a stove?
-It's from a fan.

65
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:54,716
Who thinks I don't have a stove?

66
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,009
Yeah, Tyra?

67
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:57,177
Donate all of it.

68
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:01,473
Oh, it's Tom from iHeartRadio.

69
00:03:01,557 --> 00:03:03,851
Tom, the man himself.
Talk to me.

70
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:05,686
Of course I've got
some tickets for you,

71
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:07,229
even if we are
completely sold out.

72
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:09,106
I don't think there's
a single person in this city

73
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,024
<i>who's not clamoring
to come to this wedding.</i>

74
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:15,529
Think this is one of my better lunches,
but you be the judge.

75
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:17,281
Dad, don't mess up my hair.

76
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:18,782
I thought that gave
you good luck.

77
00:03:18,991 --> 00:03:20,742
That was, like, a long time ago.

78
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:23,245
I think it was about a month ago.

79
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:24,830
How great is this?

80
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:28,292
Going to the same school together.

81
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:29,376
Mm-hm. Great.

82
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,879
Oh. And, Lou, you probably
won't see that much of me.

83
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:34,381
I know that could be
a problem for you,

84
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:37,134
but if you
need to see me anytime...

85
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,927
-I won't.
-I like the independence.

86
00:03:39,011 --> 00:03:40,095
Good.

87
00:03:40,179 --> 00:03:42,431
Oh, and you know
the student that you're shadowing, Esther?

88
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:45,350
Full disclosure,
Esther is in my math club,

89
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:48,896
but I don't want
you to feel any pressure to join.

90
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:50,480
I'm not joining.

91
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:52,191
Tough audience.

92
00:03:58,155 --> 00:03:59,990
Um... Dad?

93
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,368
-Can I go in alone?
-Of course.

94
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:05,412
I was just gonna ask you
the same thing.

95
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,247
If I could walk in alone,

96
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:08,582
you know, for my street cred.

97
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,169
I love you!

98
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:20,135
You may be good at football,
you may be good at track,

99
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:22,971
but when it comes
to math clubs...

100
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:25,182
You better watch your back!

101
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:28,310
Coolidge Pi-thons attack!

102
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,730
Yes! What's our number?

103
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:36,068
3.141592...

104
00:04:37,236 --> 00:04:38,320
65839...

105
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:39,988
-65839...
-Percy, we got it. Good.

106
00:04:40,656 --> 00:04:43,492
Okay, remember,
if you sit in the question,

107
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:45,035
the answer will find you.

108
00:04:45,369 --> 00:04:47,579
Terrific job today.
I love the energy.

109
00:04:47,663 --> 00:04:50,707
I'm telling you, if we bring
that to the Mathalon finals, we win the...

110
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,918
-Oh, Esther, you got a second?
-Yeah.

111
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:55,045
How's Lou doing? She good?

112
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,171
I think so.

113
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,881
You know, she's great at math,
so at some point,

114
00:04:57,965 --> 00:04:59,550
I wouldn't be surprised
if she starts asking

115
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:00,968
about maybe
joining the Pi-thons.

116
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:02,553
'Cause, you know,
at her last school,

117
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,638
she made it to
the Mathalon finals.

118
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:06,682
Really? She never mentioned that.

119
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:08,642
You know, that's the thing.
She's really shy.

120
00:05:08,851 --> 00:05:11,562
Oh, not at all.
She was telling me about her vacation

121
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:13,355
and about this guy named David.

122
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:15,148
David? My ex's new husband?

123
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:16,525
What did she say about him?

124
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:18,610
-Uh--
-No, it doesn't matter. Never mind.

125
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,655
Actually, go ahead. Tell me.

126
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:22,948
Oh, just that he's awesome

127
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,908
and no matter what they do,
it's always cool

128
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:27,452
-and exciting and, you know...
-Fun.

129
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:28,745
- Yeah.
- Gotcha.

130
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:30,831
-All right.
-Okay. Thanks, Esther.

131
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:33,083
I guess they're going cave diving.

132
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,919
-Hmm. Cave diving.
-Yeah.

133
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:40,507
Where?

134
00:05:40,591 --> 00:05:42,259
In a stairwell,
spying on your daughter.

135
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,844
- Really?
- We're not spying.

136
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:46,430
We're... we're just watching
from a distance.

137
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:48,098
We're not spying.

138
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:50,434
Look, she had a hard time
at her last school.

139
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:52,227
I just want to make sure she's okay.

140
00:05:52,311 --> 00:05:54,938
So, what, you thought
you'd hook her up with the cool kids?

141
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,900
Parker, you're supposed
to set a good example

142
00:05:57,983 --> 00:05:59,234
as the guidance counselor.

143
00:05:59,318 --> 00:06:02,821
I am setting the best example
with my look and my vibe alone.

144
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:06,408
Jesus, kids still do the robot?

145
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:08,160
<i>Marry me, marry me, say...</i>

146
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:10,495
-Is that a <i>Marry Me</i> ringtone?
-Guilty.

147
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:11,872
What's <i>Marry Me?</i>

148
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:13,707
It's Kat and Bastian's new song.

149
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:14,833
It's everyone's new song.

150
00:06:14,917 --> 00:06:15,918
- It's my new song.
- It's not mine.

151
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:17,169
People are gonna propose to it.

152
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:20,172
They're gonna post videos of themselves
dancing to it down the aisle.

153
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:21,715
-Are you ready to be jealous?
-Yes.

154
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:24,676
I'm taking my new girlfriend Roxy
and her ex-girlfriend

155
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,345
-to their concert/wedding.
-Shut up.

156
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:28,138
Where she's gonna
look at me and say...

157
00:06:28,222 --> 00:06:29,681
Hi, baby.

158
00:06:29,765 --> 00:06:30,933
<i>Hi, love.</i>

159
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:32,476
<i>Did you see my post?</i>

160
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,353
No. You post something?

161
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:43,403
<i>So, do you like it?</i>

162
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:45,155
I love it.

163
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:47,616
I love you.

164
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:49,243
<i>I love you more, baby.</i>

165
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,663
-When'll you be home?
<i>-About an hour.</i>

166
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:54,289
You know there's about
a thousand people

167
00:06:54,373 --> 00:06:56,083
-in this apartment right now?
<i>-What?</i>

168
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:58,752
{\an8}<i>I know.</i>

169
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:02,673
Twenty million?

170
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:04,174
<i>Yeah, of course.</i>

171
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:07,386
Oh, my God.
This has gotten so out of control.

172
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:10,305
<i>I'm on with Kat. Wait.</i>

173
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:11,640
Yeah, I just...

174
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:15,978
Now I just wish it was me and you
on a beach somewhere.

175
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:17,312
<i>No, my love.</i>

176
00:07:17,396 --> 00:07:20,023
<i>You deserve the biggest
wedding in the world.</i>

177
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:23,277
<i>And tomorrow's gonna be
the best night of our lives.</i>

178
00:07:24,528 --> 00:07:27,197
- Can't wait.
<i>- I can't wait either, baby.</i>

179
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,074
Bye.

180
00:07:32,244 --> 00:07:33,537
Where's Kat?

181
00:07:33,996 --> 00:07:35,789
An interview in ten minutes.

182
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:40,335
<i>Look what I just found.</i>

183
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:41,628
Scoot over.

184
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:44,965
I was just
looking through some old pictures.

185
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:49,428
And look at this one I saw of you,
me and Mom in Jamaica, parasailing.

186
00:07:50,012 --> 00:07:51,221
We went parasailing?

187
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:52,723
Do you not remember?

188
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:55,601
I mean, to be honest,
I don't remember you together at all.

189
00:07:57,644 --> 00:08:00,689
Well, we were, and we had fun.

190
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:03,400
I get it, Dad. You were a fun guy.

191
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:07,029
I was, and I am a fun guy.

192
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:12,117
But, you know,

193
00:08:12,743 --> 00:08:15,662
it's not just about fun.

194
00:08:15,746 --> 00:08:17,456
It's... It's harder than that.

195
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:19,750
It's work. It's...

196
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,294
Well, think about Tank.

197
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:24,004
When Tank was a puppy.

198
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:25,714
- You remember that?
- Yeah.

199
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:27,090
You remember how fun he was

200
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:30,928
and playing tug-of-war with the Frisbee
and him jumping around?

201
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:34,806
And now he's old,
and his eyes don't work,

202
00:08:35,224 --> 00:08:37,392
and you don't know
how many good years he has left,

203
00:08:37,476 --> 00:08:39,269
-but you still...
-Dad, is Tank dying?

204
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:41,230
No. No.

205
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:43,774
I'm sorry, I... Tank's good.

206
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,734
I got a little off track.

207
00:08:46,652 --> 00:08:48,946
I was just...
What I meant is that

208
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:52,824
love is about sacrifice
and the day-to-day.

209
00:08:52,908 --> 00:08:55,327
Um, dad, uh, can I go to sleep now?

210
00:08:56,537 --> 00:08:58,247
Yeah, of course. Yeah.

211
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,290
-Okay. Goodnight.
-Okay.

212
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:01,416
Night.

213
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:08,173
<i>Last time
she was here, Kat Valdez,</i>

214
00:09:08,257 --> 00:09:10,467
<i>who let's just say
is no stranger to weddings...</i>

215
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:14,513
<i>...said she wanted to do
something smaller,</i>

216
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:16,682
<i>understated, intimate,</i>

217
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:19,393
<i>with just, say,
5,000 of their closest fans.</i>

218
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:21,979
- <i>I mean friends.

219
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:25,023
<i>Just a simple wedding
for a simple gal.</i>

220
00:09:25,107 --> 00:09:28,026
- <i>Just like Mom's wedding was.

221
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,736
<i>Hey, good morning, New York.</i>

222
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,905
<i>It's 102.7. This is Seacrest with you.</i>

223
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:33,240
<i>Kat and Bastian fans,</i>

224
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:34,324
<i>it's Enrique Santos with you.</i>

225
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:36,618
<i>Tonight, Kat Valdez and Bastian</i>

226
00:09:36,702 --> 00:09:39,162
<i>will give it all they got
and tie the knot.</i>

227
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:40,539
<i>Today is the big day.</i>

228
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:42,374
<i>That shit is crazy, man.</i>

229
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:45,627
<i>"Then on the shore of
the wide world I stand alone, and think,</i>

230
00:09:45,711 --> 00:09:48,839
"Till love and fame
to nothingness do sink."

231
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:52,050
It's Keats. You think he'll like it?

232
00:09:52,134 --> 00:09:54,052
If somebody explains it to him, yeah.

233
00:09:54,887 --> 00:09:55,929
It's beautiful.

234
00:09:56,847 --> 00:09:58,932
Oh, today is your wedding day!

235
00:09:59,016 --> 00:10:00,726
- Aah!
- Yeah! Yes! Yes!

236
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:02,477
Get it. Get it.

237
00:10:02,561 --> 00:10:03,979
Tomorrow would've been
our anniversary.

238
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:05,814
You guys went out
for what, two weeks?

239
00:10:05,898 --> 00:10:08,483
Seventeen days,
if you include the breakup.

240
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:11,028
And she dumped me with a text.

241
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:12,321
So rude.

242
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,616
Come to the Kat Valdez concert
with me tonight.

243
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:18,660
Parker, I'm not
a big concert person.

244
00:10:18,744 --> 00:10:21,747
Listen, this is
a once-in-a-lifetime invitation,

245
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,583
and you don't even get it.
This is Halley's Comet.

246
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:27,085
It's you wearing an outfit
that flatters your body.

247
00:10:27,169 --> 00:10:28,378
It's very rare.

248
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:29,588
Okay, I've got Lou tonight.

249
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,715
Good. I've got three tickets.

250
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:32,966
Bring her.

251
00:10:33,342 --> 00:10:35,886
Maybe she'll think you're fun.

I know the groom is not supposed to see
the bride before the wedding.

00:16:33,118 --> 00:16:34,828
- Kat, we love you!
- Kat!

347
00:16:34,912 --> 00:16:37,664
- I'm okay.
- Kat, you're a goddess!

348
00:16:40,501 --> 00:16:42,127
I'm told that, uh...

349
00:16:46,048 --> 00:16:47,716
...20 million people are

350
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:52,763
supposed to watch me sing <i>Marry Me
</i>to the love of my life...

351
00:16:56,141 --> 00:16:58,227
...and then watch as we take our vows.

352
00:17:01,647 --> 00:17:03,899
I didn't know
she was gonna do this. Beautiful.

353
00:17:04,983 --> 00:17:08,362
So it's only natural that I would
want to see who I'm talking to.

354
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:11,406
- We love you!
- Kat, we love you!

355
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:14,409
Probably didn't know
about this either, did you?

356
00:17:14,785 --> 00:17:16,369
Only natural that I say something,

357
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:18,622
if not about marriage,

358
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:21,333
then about... love.

359
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,838
Because that's what
we're all looking for, right?

360
00:17:27,464 --> 00:17:28,715
- Love?
- Yes!

361
00:17:29,383 --> 00:17:30,384
<i>A Page Six</i> exclusive...

362
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:33,512
We get so caught up in what
we want our life to be that...

363
00:17:36,849 --> 00:17:40,435
...we forget what our love actually is.

364
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:48,986
A lie.

365
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:50,988
It's okay! We love you!

366
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:53,323
A fairy tale that
you sold yourself so long ago

367
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:56,118
that you forgot that wasn't real.

368
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:03,834
But deep down, you knew.

369
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:05,127
We love you, Kat.

370
00:18:07,129 --> 00:18:08,380
We love you, Kat!

371
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:10,632
We love you!

372
00:18:10,716 --> 00:18:12,467
She's making a fool of herself.

373
00:18:12,551 --> 00:18:14,344
No.

374
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:16,471
Somehow you knew.

375
00:18:16,555 --> 00:18:17,806
You did that.

376
00:18:18,807 --> 00:18:23,145
You realize that it wasn't love at all.

377
00:18:23,896 --> 00:18:25,439
You were just in love

378
00:18:26,064 --> 00:18:29,318
with the idea of who
you wanted that person to be.

379
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:32,279
But you can't marry an idea.

380
00:18:41,163 --> 00:18:42,664
You know, they say,
if you want something different,

381
00:18:42,748 --> 00:18:44,833
you have to do something different.

382
00:18:47,211 --> 00:18:50,506
So this time, for the first time,

383
00:18:52,382 --> 00:18:53,550
you make a different choice.

384
00:18:55,886 --> 00:19:00,057
You jump off a cliff so high
you can't even see the fall.

385
00:19:03,894 --> 00:19:05,270
And you just...

386
00:19:09,233 --> 00:19:10,901
I don't know.
I don't know.

387
00:19:14,613 --> 00:19:15,864
...say yes.

388
00:19:26,792 --> 00:19:28,085
Why not?

389
00:19:29,503 --> 00:19:30,796
Sure.

390
00:19:32,965 --> 00:19:34,049
I'll marry you.

391
00:19:34,716 --> 00:19:35,801
You.

392
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:40,514
{\an8}Dad. Dad, that's you.

393
00:19:40,597 --> 00:19:41,974
I thought it would be Bastian,

394
00:19:42,057 --> 00:19:43,934
but it's just some guy
wearing a windbreaker.

395
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:45,185
Maybe he's a celebrity
wearing a mask.

396
00:19:45,269 --> 00:19:47,020
-Is this for real?
-Yeah, it's for real!

397
00:19:47,104 --> 00:19:48,689
Jesus H. She's talking to you.

398
00:19:48,772 --> 00:19:50,357
Charlie, go! Go!

399
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,026
-Go!
-Go!

400
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,862
Go!

401
00:19:56,572 --> 00:19:58,115
{\an8}Go! Go! Go!

402
00:20:30,105 --> 00:20:31,857
Oh, my God.

403
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,617
Do you, Katrina Valdez,

404
00:20:42,826 --> 00:20:45,495
take this guy to be
your lawfully wedded husband?

405
00:20:46,121 --> 00:20:48,373
And, I mean, really take him.
Think hard, girl.

406
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,421
- I do.
- Wait, what?

407
00:20:54,505 --> 00:20:57,174
And do you, some guy,

408
00:20:57,257 --> 00:20:59,885
take Kat to be your lawfully
wedded wife?

409
00:21:00,427 --> 00:21:01,845
No! Bastian!

410
00:21:01,929 --> 00:21:03,972
- Do it!
- Yeah!

411
00:21:05,724 --> 00:21:06,892
It's on you, bro.

412
00:21:13,524 --> 00:21:14,858
Say yes!

413
00:21:15,817 --> 00:21:16,985
Okay.

414
00:21:17,069 --> 00:21:18,487
We'll take "okay."

415
00:21:18,987 --> 00:21:22,032
By the power vested in me
by the state of New York,

416
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:24,034
I now declare you

417
00:21:24,618 --> 00:21:26,078
husband and wife.

418
00:21:58,777 --> 00:22:00,320
-Kat.
-Get the hell away from me.

419
00:22:00,404 --> 00:22:02,281
-Can I just explain...
-I'm serious!

420
00:22:02,364 --> 00:22:04,324
-Get her out of here!
-Clear this area.

421
00:22:04,408 --> 00:22:07,494
- Everybody out, please.
- What's going on? What happened?

422
00:22:09,413 --> 00:22:10,414
{\an8}Baby...

423
00:22:14,001 --> 00:22:15,210
Screw you, Bastian!

424
00:22:15,294 --> 00:22:17,588
We got in that fight in Miami,
then you told me to get out.

425
00:22:17,671 --> 00:22:18,922
Oh, so this is all my fault?

426
00:22:19,006 --> 00:22:20,174
It's nothing. It was nothing.

427
00:22:20,257 --> 00:22:21,842
Get me out of here.

428
00:22:21,925 --> 00:22:23,218
-Just... Whoa, just...
-Wait.

429
00:22:23,302 --> 00:22:26,180
Who the hell do you think
you are, man? Some fan?

430
00:22:26,263 --> 00:22:27,931
No, I'm not a fan. Just...

431
00:22:28,265 --> 00:22:29,600
Well, I mean, I am now.

432
00:22:29,683 --> 00:22:31,185
Okay. We're done.
You lot, get your phones down.

433
00:22:31,268 --> 00:22:33,103
Show's over. Go, go, go.

434
00:22:33,187 --> 00:22:34,396
Carl, take these two
round the back.

435
00:22:34,479 --> 00:22:35,647
I'll have you send
decoys round the front.

436
00:22:35,731 --> 00:22:37,232
- Listen.
- Just get him out of here!

437
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,484
Hey, move.

438
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,195
Hold him there. Hold him there.

439
00:22:41,278 --> 00:22:42,404
Terry, I'm good.

440
00:23:09,556 --> 00:23:11,183
That was crazy.

441
00:23:15,354 --> 00:23:18,023
I'm sorry.
I don't know exactly what to say

442
00:23:18,106 --> 00:23:20,901
or what just happened,
but I know on some level

443
00:23:20,984 --> 00:23:23,362
you must have really
cared about that guy.

444
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:26,532
I was marrying him.

445
00:23:28,033 --> 00:23:29,284
Good point.

446
00:23:34,665 --> 00:23:37,334
He's going to age badly.

447
00:23:40,629 --> 00:23:41,922
No, he's not.

448
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,299
Yeah, you're right.

449
00:23:44,383 --> 00:23:46,510
He's probably just gonna
get better looking.

450
00:23:52,641 --> 00:23:54,810
I'm really sorry about all this.

451
00:23:57,896 --> 00:23:59,398
Me, too.

452
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:13,078
You gonna be okay?

453
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:16,832
Jeff will take you home.

454
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:19,334
Okay. Goodnight.

455
00:24:29,803 --> 00:24:30,846
<i>Charlie, finally.</i>

456
00:24:30,929 --> 00:24:32,472
Hey. How's Lou?

457
00:24:32,556 --> 00:24:34,391
<i>She's fine.
She's at her mom's. Where are you?</i>

458
00:24:34,474 --> 00:24:36,310
I'm in a garage.
I'm on my way home.

459
00:24:36,393 --> 00:24:37,561
<i>Hold on. You're saying
you haven't seen it?</i>

460
00:24:37,644 --> 00:24:39,563
<i>Oh, my God.
You are everywhere.</i>

461
00:24:39,646 --> 00:24:40,898
<i>Online, on television, on...</i>

462
00:24:40,981 --> 00:24:42,274
What do you mean "television"?

463
00:24:42,357 --> 00:24:44,276
<i>Did you hear Kat Valdez got married</i>

464
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:45,777
<i>to a different stranger
at the concert tonight?</i>

465
00:24:45,861 --> 00:24:48,113
- <i>Do you believe that?

466
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,489
<i>On the way home
from the concert tonight,</i>

467
00:24:49,573 --> 00:24:51,658
<i>Kat Valdez also left
the guy from the concert,</i>

468
00:24:51,742 --> 00:24:53,827
<i>then married her Uber driver,
and then...</i>

469
00:24:55,579 --> 00:24:57,581
<i>Now he's... he's driving them
to the honeymoon</i>

470
00:24:57,664 --> 00:25:00,000
<i>in Turks and Caicos,
where she will marry the bellboy.</i>

471
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:02,961
<i>It's very... It's all...
It's all happening...</i>

472
00:25:09,676 --> 00:25:11,053
There you are.

473
00:25:14,973 --> 00:25:16,141
You need anything?

474
00:25:21,313 --> 00:25:22,564
Just...

475
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:25,150
tell me it didn't happen.

476
00:25:27,194 --> 00:25:29,196
Why do I always pick the wrong guy?

477
00:25:33,617 --> 00:25:35,327
I let everyone down.

478
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:38,121
No, no. No, you didn't.

479
00:25:38,205 --> 00:25:40,123
I can't get out
of my own way.

480
00:25:40,207 --> 00:25:41,750
Come here. Come here.

481
00:25:43,001 --> 00:25:44,419
It's all right.

482
00:25:44,503 --> 00:25:45,671
We'll figure it out.

483
00:25:46,338 --> 00:25:48,966
I promise.

484
00:25:49,049 --> 00:25:50,300
I promise.

485
00:25:51,468 --> 00:25:52,719
We'll figure it out.

486
00:25:53,053 --> 00:25:56,265
<i>Well, the good news
is there was a wedding last night.</i>

487
00:25:56,348 --> 00:25:59,309
<i>The bad news is it was not a joke.</i>

488
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,727
<i>I have two things to say.</i>

489
00:26:00,811 --> 00:26:03,689
<i>-First, Kat, we love you...
</i>-It's Bastian.

490
00:26:03,772 --> 00:26:05,399
He says he just
needs five minutes.

491
00:26:05,482 --> 00:26:07,109
Hang up and turn that off.

492
00:26:07,734 --> 00:26:08,986
I got to go.

493
00:26:09,361 --> 00:26:10,612
God, he's unbelievable.

494
00:26:10,696 --> 00:26:11,905
What now?

495
00:26:11,989 --> 00:26:13,490
Well, he's going to Puerto Rico.

496
00:26:13,574 --> 00:26:14,950
He says he needs
to get his head together.

497
00:26:15,033 --> 00:26:16,326
Huh. Whatever.

498
00:26:16,952 --> 00:26:18,370
Kat, he was crying.

499
00:26:18,453 --> 00:26:19,705
Not helping.

500
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,253
You all right?

501
00:26:26,837 --> 00:26:28,213
No.

502
00:26:28,297 --> 00:26:30,549
Okay, well, I did
a bit of digging last night,

503
00:26:30,632 --> 00:26:33,260
and it turns out,
out of 10,000 potential dumpster fires,

504
00:26:33,343 --> 00:26:35,387
you picked a decent,
straight, single father

505
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:37,389
with no criminal record,
and get this,

506
00:26:37,472 --> 00:26:38,891
he's a maths teacher.

507
00:26:38,974 --> 00:26:40,392
-And that's good?
-It's great.

508
00:26:40,475 --> 00:26:41,768
He's not gonna be a problem.

509
00:26:41,852 --> 00:26:43,687
I say we offer $5,000,

510
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:46,273
get him to sign an NDA
and let it all blow over.

511
00:26:48,525 --> 00:26:49,693
Or...

512
00:26:50,777 --> 00:26:52,029
Or?

513
00:26:54,489 --> 00:26:55,741
Or I could stay married to him.

514
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,288
You're kidding.

515
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:03,207
You're kidding.

516
00:27:05,209 --> 00:27:06,460
You're not kidding.

517
00:27:06,543 --> 00:27:08,003
You can't. We can't.

518
00:27:08,086 --> 00:27:10,464
It's not legal. We didn't file papers.

519
00:27:10,547 --> 00:27:11,840
So file the papers.

520
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:13,175
Wha...

521
00:27:13,967 --> 00:27:15,969
I mean, play
the record through here.

522
00:27:16,053 --> 00:27:17,429
I started
something last night,

523
00:27:17,513 --> 00:27:19,848
and if I don't finish it, I look crazy.

524
00:27:19,932 --> 00:27:21,767
"Er." You'll look crazier.

525
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:24,269
<i>Namaste.</i>

526
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:27,356
Yeah, we got to get
out in front of this.

527
00:27:27,439 --> 00:27:30,609
Now, he thinks
he can publicly humiliate me? Screw him.

528
00:27:30,692 --> 00:27:34,530
This is a manic response
to an insane situation.

529
00:27:34,613 --> 00:27:36,740
No, we have to change
the narrative.

530
00:27:36,823 --> 00:27:38,367
All right? I'm not
marrying him forever.

531
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:41,703
It's just for a month,
uh, a few months.

532
00:27:41,787 --> 00:27:43,455
Now, presuming
the man you married

533
00:27:43,539 --> 00:27:45,832
doesn't have a girlfriend or a life,

534
00:27:45,916 --> 00:27:48,210
and presuming I can
get him to agree,

535
00:27:48,293 --> 00:27:50,546
I'm not sure
exactly what we're telling the world.

536
00:27:51,213 --> 00:27:52,756
You don't want to be a joke.

537
00:27:53,674 --> 00:27:55,509
I don't want to be
the punch line.

538
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:00,222
We have to embrace
the spontaneity of the moment

539
00:28:00,305 --> 00:28:01,682
and just say...

540
00:28:04,226 --> 00:28:06,019
"Nothing else has worked.

541
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,149
"Maybe this will."

542
00:28:19,283 --> 00:28:20,284
You know what they say to do

543
00:28:20,367 --> 00:28:22,452
when your car's skidding
out of control, Colin?

544
00:28:23,287 --> 00:28:25,080
Close your eyes and pray?

545
00:28:27,374 --> 00:28:29,459
Hit the gas and turn into it.

546
00:28:29,543 --> 00:28:30,711
Wait, what are you saying?

547
00:28:30,794 --> 00:28:32,462
Rethink the paradigm.

548
00:28:32,546 --> 00:28:34,214
We're not selling
the world a fairy tale.

549
00:28:34,298 --> 00:28:35,966
We're taking
the fairy tale off the table.

550
00:28:36,049 --> 00:28:37,217
That's what you did last night.

551
00:28:37,301 --> 00:28:38,677
-That's what I did?
-Yeah.

552
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,804
Look, I was just
trying to help someone who seemed like

553
00:28:40,888 --> 00:28:42,306
they were in the middle
of a nervous breakdown.

554
00:28:42,389 --> 00:28:44,391
We're calling it
a break from tradition.

555
00:28:44,474 --> 00:28:46,977
A moment of clarity where
she picked you out of a crowd

556
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:49,313
and you, my friend, picked her.

557
00:28:49,396 --> 00:28:51,231
I don't even know her.

558
00:28:51,315 --> 00:28:53,817
Kat Valdez is a legend.

559
00:28:53,901 --> 00:28:56,153
Self-made.
She was raised by a single father

560
00:28:56,236 --> 00:28:58,447
who died before she had
any kind of success.

561
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:00,240
Now she's a woman north of 35

562
00:29:00,324 --> 00:29:02,784
in a business
that marginalizes women at any age.

563
00:29:02,868 --> 00:29:05,078
People love their artists
to bare their souls,

564
00:29:05,162 --> 00:29:06,580
then vilify them if they go too far.

565
00:29:06,663 --> 00:29:08,498
Well, I'm not gonna
let them do that to her.

566
00:29:08,582 --> 00:29:10,584
-And I'm asking you to help me.
-How?

567
00:29:10,667 --> 00:29:13,045
Stand beside her for three months.

568
00:29:13,128 --> 00:29:14,338
And what does she think about this?

569
00:29:14,421 --> 00:29:16,048
It was her idea.

570
00:29:16,131 --> 00:29:18,592
-She had the idea for...
-Yeah.

571
00:29:19,218 --> 00:29:20,719
What if we offered you $10,000?

572
00:29:20,802 --> 00:29:23,096
No. No, no, no. Wrong approach.

573
00:29:23,555 --> 00:29:24,932
Offer him, like, a fundraiser.

574
00:29:25,015 --> 00:29:26,266
He'll go for that.

575
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:29,686
Oh... Hi. I'm sorry. Are you two...

576
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:31,063
Ew. Gross. No.

577
00:29:31,146 --> 00:29:33,440
Parker Debs, guidance counselor.
Same school.

578
00:29:33,524 --> 00:29:36,193
How about, uh,
we host a fundraiser for your math club?

579
00:29:36,276 --> 00:29:37,986
Don't answer that. Okay.

580
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:41,782
What about if it's, like,
instead of three months, it's six months,

581
00:29:42,616 --> 00:29:44,910
and it could be,
like, a whole math wing?

582
00:29:44,993 --> 00:29:46,912
I'm thinking about the children.

583
00:29:46,995 --> 00:29:48,622
Yeah, this is ridiculous.

584
00:29:48,705 --> 00:29:52,251
I don't think anyone's gonna believe
that she's gonna go from Bastian to me.

585
00:29:52,334 --> 00:29:53,836
-That's a good point.
-Well, the fact is

586
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:55,838
that she did go
from Bastian to you.

587
00:29:55,921 --> 00:29:57,089
Counterpoint.

588
00:29:57,172 --> 00:29:58,924
We're not pretending you're in love.

589
00:29:59,007 --> 00:30:00,551
We're just gonna say
that you're getting

590
00:30:00,634 --> 00:30:02,052
to know each other,
and if it goes further,

591
00:30:02,135 --> 00:30:03,303
then great, and if it doesn't...

592
00:30:03,387 --> 00:30:04,805
It won't. Come...

593
00:30:04,888 --> 00:30:07,474
-Not with that attitude.
-Well, then it doesn't have to.

594
00:30:08,225 --> 00:30:10,310
This is about this moment.

595
00:30:10,394 --> 00:30:13,814
Managing the media
frenzy until things die down.

596
00:30:13,897 --> 00:30:15,399
I have a daughter.

597
00:30:15,482 --> 00:30:18,026
I don't want
to drag her into the middle of a circus.

598
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:22,155
I can assure you, we won't impinge
on your life whatsoever.

599
00:30:22,698 --> 00:30:24,616
How does it feel
to not be a nobody?

600
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,910
How do you feel about her being so much
hotter than you, Charlie?

601
00:30:26,994 --> 00:30:28,161
Hey, Charlie! Right here!

602
00:30:28,245 --> 00:30:30,205
Hey, Charlie, are you gonna go through
with this? Where's the honeymoon?

603
00:30:30,289 --> 00:30:31,957
Did you get
a good look at him?

604
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,584
Yeah. He's cute.

605
00:30:33,667 --> 00:30:35,002
What?

606
00:30:35,085 --> 00:30:36,753
- He's fine.
- Hey.

607
00:30:36,837 --> 00:30:38,547
Charlie, come in.

608
00:30:40,048 --> 00:30:41,425
Oh, she's right there. Jesus.

609
00:30:42,426 --> 00:30:43,510
Come over, guys.

610
00:30:43,594 --> 00:30:45,262
Charlie, Kat. Kat, Charlie.

611
00:30:45,345 --> 00:30:46,680
-Hi. Oh.
-How are you? Oh.

612
00:30:48,473 --> 00:30:50,851
- Okay.
- I'm Parker.

613
00:30:50,934 --> 00:30:53,645
I'm... I am the one
who brought Charlie to the concert,

614
00:30:53,729 --> 00:30:54,813
- so I'm...
- Yep.

615
00:30:54,897 --> 00:30:57,274
Basically, I guess
I'm responsible for this whole thing.

616
00:30:57,983 --> 00:30:59,193
Hi, Parker.

617
00:30:59,276 --> 00:31:00,277
Hey, Kat.

618
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,486
Hi.

619
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:03,155
Would you do me a favor,

620
00:31:03,238 --> 00:31:05,032
uh, just two seconds,
and just say,

621
00:31:05,115 --> 00:31:06,617
"Roxy, you really blew it"?

622
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:09,161
<i>Today Show</i> is a go
at 10:00 on Tuesday.

623
00:31:09,244 --> 00:31:11,038
-Sorry.
-They want...

624
00:31:11,121 --> 00:31:12,164
Charlie.

625
00:31:12,247 --> 00:31:15,751
Charlie in studio
and Kat remote from London.

626
00:31:15,834 --> 00:31:16,835
-Kat.
-Excuse me one second.

627
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:18,504
-I just have to take a call.
-Okay.

628
00:31:18,587 --> 00:31:20,130
-Bye, Kat.
-Everything's set up...

629
00:31:20,214 --> 00:31:22,341
-She's like a real person.
-All right, so what's going on?

630
00:31:22,424 --> 00:31:24,051
Oh, we're booking
interviews all week.

631
00:31:24,134 --> 00:31:25,636
Uh-huh. I thought
that's what today was.

632
00:31:25,719 --> 00:31:27,596
No, no. Today's more
of a press conference.

633
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:30,390
But throughout the next few weeks,
we're gonna have some sit-downs and B-roll

634
00:31:30,474 --> 00:31:32,309
and news outlets following us,
charting the progress

635
00:31:32,392 --> 00:31:33,936
as you two get to know each other.

636
00:31:34,019 --> 00:31:35,062
It's all in your email.

637
00:31:35,145 --> 00:31:36,313
I don't check my emails a lot.

638
00:31:36,396 --> 00:31:38,774
How do you schedule your life
if you don't check your email?

639
00:31:39,566 --> 00:31:40,734
Easy. I can't do anything

640
00:31:40,817 --> 00:31:43,403
between 8:00 and 3:00
Monday through Friday,

641
00:31:43,487 --> 00:31:44,988
and I have math club after school,

642
00:31:45,072 --> 00:31:46,573
and three days a week,
I have my kid.

643
00:31:46,657 --> 00:31:48,742
Beyond that,
I'm pretty much available.

644
00:31:48,825 --> 00:31:51,078
-So, sorry...
-Melissa.

645
00:31:51,161 --> 00:31:53,247
Melissa, you're gonna
have to move <i>The Today Show.</i>

646
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:54,414
What? Excuse me?

647
00:31:54,498 --> 00:31:56,083
We don't move <i>The Today Show.</i>

648
00:31:56,166 --> 00:31:58,585
We move for <i>The Today Show.</i>

649
00:31:58,669 --> 00:32:00,170
-He's gonna have to shift his schedule.
-Okay, I'll handle it.

650
00:32:00,254 --> 00:32:02,256
Okay, I can handle my own life.

651
00:32:02,339 --> 00:32:04,007
I can help him handle it.

652
00:32:04,091 --> 00:32:06,343
Uh, Melissa,
shouldn't you be posting Vitamix?

653
00:32:06,426 --> 00:32:07,678
That's Tyra's job.

654
00:32:08,762 --> 00:32:10,681
Oh. Right.

655
00:32:10,764 --> 00:32:11,974
Morning, everybody.
I don't know about you guys,

656
00:32:12,057 --> 00:32:14,101
but when I get up in the morning,
I like to meditate.

657
00:32:14,184 --> 00:32:16,311
I also love to have fresh juice.

658
00:32:16,395 --> 00:32:19,273
So I like to juice daily with my Vitamix.

659
00:32:19,356 --> 00:32:22,359
I take my fresh greens, mix and go.

660
00:32:22,442 --> 00:32:23,986
Okay, look, I hate
to interrupt an artist

661
00:32:24,069 --> 00:32:26,113
while she's juicing,
but we're gonna have to draw

662
00:32:26,196 --> 00:32:27,906
a hard line when it comes
to the students

663
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:30,117
-and the schedule, okay?
-Yeah.

664
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,451
You're a little shiny.

665
00:32:31,535 --> 00:32:33,954
Awesome. Let's take a selfie.

666
00:32:35,205 --> 00:32:36,623
I don't feel comfortable.

667
00:32:36,707 --> 00:32:38,834
-I really don't feel this is my world.
-It's natural.

668
00:32:38,917 --> 00:32:42,462
It just feels like everyone walking around
is, like, a sycophant.

669
00:32:42,546 --> 00:32:45,174
Everything in her life is sponsored.

670
00:32:45,257 --> 00:32:47,301
-I know, but don't ruin this for me.
-No, but listen to me.

671
00:32:47,384 --> 00:32:49,303
- I...
- Hey.

672
00:32:49,887 --> 00:32:51,263
-How we doing?
-I'm sorry.

673
00:32:51,346 --> 00:32:53,348
I don't... I don't think
it's gonna work out.

674
00:32:53,432 --> 00:32:54,433
It's just perspective.

675
00:32:54,516 --> 00:32:55,809
No, it's not just perspective.

676
00:32:55,893 --> 00:32:57,978
You see her as some pop star
with endorsement deals,

677
00:32:58,061 --> 00:32:59,897
a narcissist who takes
meaningless selfies,

678
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:01,023
but that's not the full...

679
00:33:01,106 --> 00:33:02,858
Well, I mean, is a selfie
ever meaningful? I mean...

680
00:33:02,941 --> 00:33:03,942
Look up.

681
00:33:04,026 --> 00:33:07,863
Look, I don't mean to be negative,
but I'm not a big social media person.

682
00:33:07,946 --> 00:33:09,781
I feel it's kind of a distorted reality.

683
00:33:09,865 --> 00:33:11,867
I'm so glad I came to your TED Talk.

684
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:14,703
No, come on. I see it
all the time in my students.

685
00:33:14,786 --> 00:33:15,954
- It's...
- Kat's ready to walk.

686
00:33:16,038 --> 00:33:17,039
Okay, she's ready.

687
00:33:17,122 --> 00:33:19,750
Social media
can also reach people.

688
00:33:19,833 --> 00:33:21,376
-No, I know. Yeah.
-It can be a tool.

689
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:22,794
You know what a tool is,
though, right, Charlie?

690
00:33:22,878 --> 00:33:25,255
- Okay. Thank you, Melissa.
- Burn.

691
00:33:27,299 --> 00:33:28,842
I know this is a lot.

692
00:33:28,926 --> 00:33:30,802
Just go out there
and be yourself.

693
00:33:30,886 --> 00:33:33,180
Myself probably
wouldn't be here, but...

694
00:33:33,263 --> 00:33:34,681
Listen, if you don't
want to do this...

695
00:33:34,765 --> 00:33:37,392
Uh... What, then I leave?

696
00:33:38,477 --> 00:33:39,603
I thought you said he was into this.

697
00:33:39,686 --> 00:33:41,688
- He is.
- He can hear you.

698
00:33:41,772 --> 00:33:44,942
Ladies and gentlemen,
Kat Valdez and her new husband,

699
00:33:45,025 --> 00:33:46,318
Charlie Gilbert.

700
00:33:52,366 --> 00:33:55,202
So, you think it's romantic
marrying a complete stranger?

701
00:33:55,285 --> 00:33:58,121
Uh, impulsive, without a plan.

702
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:01,708
But, hey, look where my plans got me.

703
00:34:01,792 --> 00:34:03,210
So, you just

704
00:34:03,293 --> 00:34:04,628
threw caution to the wind
and thought...

705
00:34:04,711 --> 00:34:06,547
{\an8}I didn't think, actually.

706
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:07,965
It was a moment.

707
00:34:08,047 --> 00:34:09,842
You're banking a lifetime on a moment?

708
00:34:09,925 --> 00:34:12,302
No, I'm banking a moment on a moment.

709
00:34:12,386 --> 00:34:14,471
Get enough of those,
and that's a lifetime.

710
00:34:14,554 --> 00:34:16,348
You know nothing about each other.

711
00:34:16,431 --> 00:34:17,891
Did you think twice?

712
00:34:17,975 --> 00:34:18,976
Charlie?

713
00:34:19,059 --> 00:34:20,811
People meet randomly
all the time.

714
00:34:20,893 --> 00:34:22,896
At a... At a bar or...

715
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:23,981
Online.

716
00:34:24,063 --> 00:34:26,315
Yeah, online, at 7-Eleven.

717
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:29,862
I mean, why is this any crazier?

718
00:34:29,945 --> 00:34:32,447
To state the obvious, you got married.

719
00:34:34,699 --> 00:34:36,994
Yeah, and...

720
00:34:37,077 --> 00:34:39,705
Now we get to know each other.

721
00:34:39,788 --> 00:34:42,456
- But not as man and wife?
- No.

722
00:34:42,541 --> 00:34:44,458
That would be nuts.

723
00:34:44,543 --> 00:34:45,710
Just for her.

724
00:34:45,793 --> 00:34:47,920
For me, it would be pretty amazing.

725
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:53,844
Last night, I held up a friend's sign
asking a woman to marry me,

726
00:34:53,927 --> 00:34:57,931
and she said, yes,
and I did, and...

727
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:03,145
you know, I did it not, you know,
because she was beautiful...

728
00:35:03,228 --> 00:35:04,897
Well, maybe a little...

729
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:09,943
Uh, but it just seemed like,
in the moment, the right thing to do.

730
00:35:10,027 --> 00:35:13,739
So, what, you just saw
each other and said, yes?

731
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,410
Yes.

732
00:35:19,661 --> 00:35:21,413
And that doesn't seem frivolous?

733
00:35:23,415 --> 00:35:26,001
Historically, marriage was transactional.

734
00:35:26,084 --> 00:35:28,378
It was about expanding your empire,

735
00:35:28,462 --> 00:35:31,590
and a woman's value
was based on what she brought.

736
00:35:31,673 --> 00:35:34,009
Like, "You give me a heifer,
and I'll give you my daughter."

737
00:35:36,053 --> 00:35:37,471
It's terrible. I know. That's...

738
00:35:37,554 --> 00:35:39,723
You know, I didn't come up with it.

739
00:35:39,806 --> 00:35:43,393
But it really was a business deal,

740
00:35:43,477 --> 00:35:45,562
and it wasn't designed
to be about love,

741
00:35:45,646 --> 00:35:49,358
and maybe that's where people
kind of get tripped up now.

742
00:35:49,441 --> 00:35:52,027
This is your
second marriage, right, Charlie?

743
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:53,779
You wouldn't want to fail again.

744
00:35:57,574 --> 00:36:00,160
Well, you haven't lived
unless you've failed, Bill.

745
00:36:00,244 --> 00:36:02,287
You should know that
from your time at CNBC.

746
00:36:03,914 --> 00:36:07,209
Listen, what we did was crazy.

747
00:36:07,292 --> 00:36:09,169
We know that, but, you know,

748
00:36:09,253 --> 00:36:12,005
it was just truly a leap of faith.

749
00:36:12,756 --> 00:36:15,801
The rules as they exist
pretty much suck for women.

750
00:36:15,884 --> 00:36:18,345
I mean, why do
we have to wait for men to propose?

751
00:36:18,428 --> 00:36:20,681
Why is everything on his terms?

752
00:36:20,764 --> 00:36:23,517
No, I think it is time
to shake things up.

753
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,310
How about this? We pick the guy,

754
00:36:25,394 --> 00:36:28,522
we keep our name
and let him earn the right to stay.

755
00:36:35,362 --> 00:36:37,114
That was terrific.

756
00:36:37,197 --> 00:36:38,740
No, no, seriously. Oh, and listen.

757
00:36:38,824 --> 00:36:40,033
Don't worry about Tuesday.

758
00:36:40,117 --> 00:36:41,368
We'll adjust our schedule around yours.

759
00:36:41,451 --> 00:36:42,870
-It'll be fine.
-Thanks. I appreciate it.

760
00:36:42,953 --> 00:36:44,204
-No, of course.
-We'll try not to

761
00:36:44,288 --> 00:36:45,747
turn your life
upside down too much.

762
00:36:45,831 --> 00:36:48,208
I think it might be
a little too late for that.

763
00:36:48,292 --> 00:36:49,877
I mean, do you ever
get used to this?

764
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:54,631
Just the attention
and the chaos and the people everywhere?

765
00:36:54,715 --> 00:36:56,216
I don't know.
Some days, you barely notice.

766
00:36:56,300 --> 00:37:00,262
Other days, you feel like...
a panda in a zoo.

767
00:37:01,555 --> 00:37:03,724
You should know that up front.

768
00:37:03,807 --> 00:37:05,309
Got it.

769
00:37:05,392 --> 00:37:08,312
-Where you off to now?
-Oh, London, for a meeting.

770
00:37:09,229 --> 00:37:11,481
And I'm off to Flatbush for a dog,

771
00:37:11,565 --> 00:37:13,734
which pretty much sums it up.

772
00:37:15,402 --> 00:37:17,154
I'll see you at the next photo op?

773
00:37:17,237 --> 00:37:18,405
Okay.

774
00:37:20,449 --> 00:37:22,117
Don't forget to check your schedule.

775
00:37:22,201 --> 00:37:23,285
I got it.

776
00:37:23,368 --> 00:37:26,205
OMG. He can't even text with that.

777
00:37:26,288 --> 00:37:28,332
OMG. Yes, he can.

778
00:37:28,415 --> 00:37:30,083
But very slowly.

779
00:37:42,429 --> 00:37:45,098
You did not look nervous,
and you know what, you kind of have

780
00:37:45,182 --> 00:37:46,642
offbeat good looks
for someone...

781
00:37:46,725 --> 00:37:48,227
-Offbeat?
-Charlie Valdez!

782
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:49,770
-Charlie, over here!
-What are they doing here?

783
00:37:49,853 --> 00:37:51,230
Relax. We're famous now.

784
00:37:51,313 --> 00:37:52,856
Is this a throuple?

785
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:54,942
Where's your wife?
Why don't you live with her?

786
00:37:55,025 --> 00:37:56,276
Why are you yelling at me?

787
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,903
- I'm standing right here.
- Come on, Charlie.

788
00:37:57,986 --> 00:37:59,279
- I'm gonna go inside.
- What are you doing?

789
00:37:59,363 --> 00:38:00,531
Are you now Mr. Valdez?

790
00:38:00,614 --> 00:38:01,865
Are you
in the doghouse, huh?

791
00:38:01,949 --> 00:38:03,825
Gonna be a short walk.

792
00:38:03,909 --> 00:38:05,786
Go inside. I'll deal with this.

793
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:07,579
You been
kicked out already?

794
00:38:07,663 --> 00:38:10,832
The dog can't shit
if people are watching.

795
00:38:10,916 --> 00:38:13,710
Luckily, I can only shit
if people are watching,

796
00:38:13,794 --> 00:38:16,380
so if you're feeling lucky...

797
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,675
I'm busy, too, by the way.

798
00:38:28,642 --> 00:38:29,977
<i>What's your name, baby?</i>

799
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:31,895
<i>- Janice.
<i>- Janice.</i>

800
00:38:32,688 --> 00:38:34,773
<i>You look so sexy tonight.</i>

801
00:38:44,283 --> 00:38:45,284
<i>I don't know about you guys,</i>

802
00:38:45,367 --> 00:38:46,869
<i>but when I get up in the morning,
I like to meditate.</i>

803
00:38:46,952 --> 00:38:49,204
<i>I also love to have fresh juice.</i>

804
00:38:49,288 --> 00:38:51,832
<i>So I like to juice daily with my Vitamix.</i>

805
00:38:51,915 --> 00:38:53,375
Could we get a Vitamix?

806
00:38:53,458 --> 00:38:55,002
I'd like to juice daily.

807
00:38:55,085 --> 00:38:57,296
Come on. Put that down.
No electronics at dinner.

808
00:38:57,379 --> 00:38:58,547
What do you call that?

809
00:38:59,464 --> 00:39:01,550
I call that a nature documentary,

810
00:39:01,633 --> 00:39:03,594
so we can travel while we eat.

811
00:39:04,678 --> 00:39:05,888
Put it down.

812
00:39:07,764 --> 00:39:10,851
So, is Kat, like, my stepmom?

813
00:39:10,934 --> 00:39:12,311
No, Lou. Come on.

814
00:39:12,394 --> 00:39:15,480
Dad, I think this experience is actually
really good for you.

815
00:39:15,564 --> 00:39:16,690
Says my 12-year-old?

816
00:39:16,773 --> 00:39:20,402
It's true. I mean, you never just, like,
do things without planning them.

817
00:39:20,485 --> 00:39:21,778
I think it's cool.

818
00:39:21,862 --> 00:39:23,530
I really want to meet her.

819
00:39:23,614 --> 00:39:28,076
I mean, Parker says she's nice,
and smart, and next-level hot.

820
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,412
She is nice. She is...
She's an attract...

821
00:39:30,495 --> 00:39:31,830
Here, let me get this.

822
00:39:32,664 --> 00:39:34,708
Dad, she just hit 80 million
followers on Instagram.

823
00:39:34,791 --> 00:39:36,376
Okay. I'm not impressed.

824
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:39,171
Talk to me when she gets
to 90 million, okay?

825
00:39:39,254 --> 00:39:40,506
Lou, it's not real.

826
00:39:40,589 --> 00:39:41,840
It's all a facade.

827
00:39:41,924 --> 00:39:43,842
You know, they had me wearing makeup.

828
00:39:43,926 --> 00:39:45,719
You wear makeup now?

829
00:39:45,802 --> 00:39:47,930
Wore once. Never again.

830
00:39:48,013 --> 00:39:49,223
Well, you never say never,

831
00:39:50,182 --> 00:39:51,266
but I don't plan on it

832
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:53,727
in the next couple months
that we're doing this.

833
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:56,396
And you're saying
the whole time I can't meet her?

834
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,898
I don't think
Mom would want that.

835
00:39:57,981 --> 00:39:59,900
Actually, Mom wants
to meet her, too.

836
00:39:59,983 --> 00:40:01,235
Oh, perfect.

837
00:40:01,318 --> 00:40:03,654
Lou, you know
that we're not really together.

838
00:40:03,737 --> 00:40:06,281
Her manager stages things. Look.

839
00:40:07,324 --> 00:40:09,117
-You have an iPhone?
-Yeah.

840
00:40:09,201 --> 00:40:11,036
I mean, it's just for scheduling.

841
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:13,330
-They're making me use it.
-Huh.

842
00:40:13,413 --> 00:40:15,791
Yeah, bowling, and then we're gonna
do a photo shoot, so...

843
00:40:15,874 --> 00:40:19,878
Uh-huh. But do you guys,
like, talk ever?

844
00:40:20,212 --> 00:40:22,130
It's just publicity. It's not real.

845
00:40:22,798 --> 00:40:24,007
Hmm.

846
00:40:25,217 --> 00:40:27,427
Yeah! Come on!

847
00:40:27,511 --> 00:40:29,137
Okay, your turn.

848
00:40:29,221 --> 00:40:30,973
Don't be nervous. It's just, uh...

849
00:40:31,056 --> 00:40:32,558
It's not a competition. Just having fun.

850
00:40:32,641 --> 00:40:33,976
Okay, no. I'm guessing

851
00:40:34,059 --> 00:40:35,978
from the way you're holding
that that you haven't done

852
00:40:36,061 --> 00:40:38,105
-too much bowling.
-Uh, what do I do?

853
00:40:38,188 --> 00:40:40,274
Well, you're gonna want
to put your fingers

854
00:40:40,357 --> 00:40:41,692
-in the holes there.
-Yeah. Uh-huh.

855
00:40:41,775 --> 00:40:43,360
This one, yeah.
Get your thumb in that one.

856
00:40:43,443 --> 00:40:44,695
{\an8}-There? That one? Okay.
-Yep. And then take

857
00:40:44,778 --> 00:40:47,155
{\an8}three steps kind of...
You want to land on your left,

858
00:40:47,239 --> 00:40:49,741
and don't be afraid
to use those little...

859
00:40:54,913 --> 00:40:56,957
A strike is better
than a spare, right?

860
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,501
That is not your first time bowling.

861
00:40:59,585 --> 00:41:01,420
Yes! Did you get that?

862
00:41:01,503 --> 00:41:03,755
-Come on! The old rope-a-dope.
-Yes!

863
00:41:04,298 --> 00:41:08,385
Oh, my God. I wish I put money on this,
because people are loving it.

864
00:41:08,468 --> 00:41:10,804
-What people?
-Well, this is an Instagram live feed,

865
00:41:10,888 --> 00:41:12,890
and 237,000 people

866
00:41:12,973 --> 00:41:14,766
are like, "Why is he
such a boring nerd?"

867
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:16,727
-Mel.
-What? Their words, not mine.

868
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:17,978
Get off the live, Mel.

869
00:41:18,061 --> 00:41:19,313
All right.

870
00:41:19,396 --> 00:41:22,191
So, we just need a little bit more
B-roll for <i>The Today Show.</i>

871
00:41:22,274 --> 00:41:24,776
Well, I've got to get home to Tank.

872
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:26,361
-Is Tank his daughter?
-Stop.

873
00:41:26,445 --> 00:41:28,071
-Okay.
-You have to go?

874
00:41:28,155 --> 00:41:30,240
Yeah, if you guys are done with me.

875
00:41:30,699 --> 00:41:32,701
Mm-hmm. We're going to a party.

876
00:41:33,202 --> 00:41:34,286
You go.

877
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:37,164
Where's home?

878
00:41:42,544 --> 00:41:44,171
Wow. Cool.

879
00:41:44,379 --> 00:41:45,380
Thanks.

880
00:41:46,632 --> 00:41:48,759
Yeah, it's a...

881
00:41:49,718 --> 00:41:51,845
Kat, meet dog.

882
00:41:51,929 --> 00:41:53,722
Wow, I never heard
that one before.

883
00:41:53,805 --> 00:41:57,017
Sorry. That was pretty... ruff.

884
00:41:58,685 --> 00:42:01,772
You are so lucky
that Mel didn't hear you say that.

885
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:03,315
No, I'm lucky Mel isn't here.

886
00:42:03,398 --> 00:42:05,484
I feel like you're never alone.

887
00:42:05,567 --> 00:42:07,069
What? I'm alone now.

888
00:42:07,152 --> 00:42:10,197
Well, I mean, yeah, other than Kofi.

889
00:42:10,405 --> 00:42:11,782
Just ignore him.

890
00:42:11,865 --> 00:42:14,368
Is everything you do filmed?

891
00:42:14,868 --> 00:42:16,662
- Banked.
- Banked?

892
00:42:16,745 --> 00:42:18,121
For my channel.

893
00:42:18,539 --> 00:42:20,415
Just little mini episodes of life.

894
00:42:23,043 --> 00:42:24,169
Uh...

895
00:42:24,336 --> 00:42:25,754
Can we skip an episode?

896
00:42:29,258 --> 00:42:31,844
- Want me to go?
- Yeah, you can go.

897
00:42:31,927 --> 00:42:33,762
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Goodnight. I'll see you.

898
00:42:33,846 --> 00:42:35,097
Happy?

899
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:36,181
Relieved.

900
00:42:37,724 --> 00:42:38,934
Is this your daughter?

901
00:42:39,017 --> 00:42:40,477
- Yeah.
- She's cute.

902
00:42:40,561 --> 00:42:42,771
Thanks. Yeah, she's great.

903
00:42:42,855 --> 00:42:46,233
Although she is
in that awkward in-between phase

904
00:42:46,316 --> 00:42:47,943
where she's still my baby girl,

905
00:42:48,026 --> 00:42:51,446
but she definitely
wants nothing to do with me.

906
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:53,407
And you can forget
about getting hugs,

907
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:55,826
'cause it's not happening anymore,

908
00:42:55,909 --> 00:42:57,619
which kind of breaks my heart,

909
00:42:57,703 --> 00:43:00,080
but that's the way it goes.

910
00:43:00,831 --> 00:43:02,332
What happened with her mom?

911
00:43:04,376 --> 00:43:05,794
I mean, I'm sorry, you don't...

912
00:43:05,878 --> 00:43:07,045
You know, it's none of my business.

913
00:43:07,129 --> 00:43:08,297
You don't have to tell me.

914
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:10,465
No, it's okay. Um...

915
00:43:11,758 --> 00:43:14,261
We were married,
and we actually had a good marriage.

916
00:43:14,344 --> 00:43:15,554
You know, then,

917
00:43:15,929 --> 00:43:17,181
I don't know,
all of a sudden, I got the feeling

918
00:43:17,264 --> 00:43:19,558
she didn't want it
or she didn't want me anymore,

919
00:43:19,641 --> 00:43:22,102
and I had nothing
to do but let her go.

920
00:43:22,603 --> 00:43:25,063
And, you know,
statistically, we're screwed,

921
00:43:25,147 --> 00:43:29,067
'cause 48% of marriages
end in divorce, so...

922
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:30,944
That means 52% work.

923
00:43:31,028 --> 00:43:32,654
Ah, an optimist.

924
00:43:34,114 --> 00:43:35,991
-This is so cool. Can I?
-Yeah.

925
00:43:37,117 --> 00:43:39,369
And then I think when you get up to,
like, second and third,

926
00:43:39,453 --> 00:43:41,538
then it jumps up to,
like, 67% failure rate.

927
00:43:41,622 --> 00:43:43,707
Even if it's one in a billion,

928
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:46,043
what does it matter?
It's worth a shot.

929
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,795
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

930
00:43:48,879 --> 00:43:50,130
I believe in marriage.

931
00:43:50,214 --> 00:43:51,256
Jesus, still?

932
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:53,592
Haven't you been
married like six times?

933
00:43:53,675 --> 00:43:54,843
Three times.

934
00:43:55,219 --> 00:43:57,054
Not including this. This is four.

935
00:43:57,971 --> 00:44:00,307
But the first time
was only 48 hours, so...

936
00:44:01,099 --> 00:44:02,184
doesn't count.

937
00:44:02,267 --> 00:44:04,311
But still, do you ever
feel like just kind of,

938
00:44:04,394 --> 00:44:07,314
"I'm waving the white flag
on marriage. That's it."

939
00:44:07,397 --> 00:44:08,941
No, it's like math.

940
00:44:09,233 --> 00:44:12,236
When you get a problem wrong,
you just don't give up on it.

941
00:44:14,154 --> 00:44:15,989
You keep trying till you get it right.

942
00:44:16,073 --> 00:44:17,366
<i>And what about
you and Bastian?</i>

943
00:44:17,449 --> 00:44:18,992
How long were
you guys together?

944
00:44:19,076 --> 00:44:20,953
Mm. Year and a half.

945
00:44:21,036 --> 00:44:23,664
I'd just split
from my second husband.

946
00:44:23,872 --> 00:44:25,749
He was a music producer
who did, uh,

947
00:44:25,832 --> 00:44:29,086
my last two albums
and then sold a sex tape.

948
00:44:29,461 --> 00:44:31,296
That's not the worst part.

949
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:33,882
The worst part is
I thought I could fix things.

950
00:44:34,383 --> 00:44:36,343
Pretty hard to fix a sex tape.

951
00:44:36,927 --> 00:44:38,053
Right.

952
00:44:41,849 --> 00:44:45,018
Sorry. Yeah,
it's just a little power nap.

953
00:44:45,727 --> 00:44:47,437
-Pacing himself.
-Hmm.

954
00:44:48,313 --> 00:44:50,607
If we give him a minute,
he'll... he'll restart.

955
00:44:50,691 --> 00:44:53,026
-Okay.
-But you were saying?

956
00:44:53,110 --> 00:44:54,611
Well, this business,
those type of guys,

957
00:44:54,695 --> 00:44:56,405
they build you up
to break you down.

958
00:44:56,488 --> 00:44:57,990
But you were
already famous, so...

959
00:44:58,073 --> 00:44:59,700
It's not about fame.

960
00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:02,619
You know, it's about credibility.

961
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:05,747
It just didn't matter
how successful I was.

962
00:45:05,831 --> 00:45:08,500
They never gave it to me.

963
00:45:09,585 --> 00:45:11,670
You know, I've never been
nominated for anything?

964
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:14,715
And then I met Bastian.

965
00:45:15,716 --> 00:45:16,758
And he...

966
00:45:17,301 --> 00:45:18,719
And he gave me this.

967
00:45:22,014 --> 00:45:23,932
"Sing." What does that mean?

968
00:45:24,558 --> 00:45:26,268
It means "Don't let them win."

969
00:45:31,398 --> 00:45:32,900
Nobody's all bad, Charlie.

970
00:45:32,983 --> 00:45:35,194
If they were, it would
make it so much easier.

971
00:45:35,861 --> 00:45:38,447
But cheating on you with
your assistant is pretty bad.

972
00:45:42,576 --> 00:45:45,204
Okay.

973
00:45:50,083 --> 00:45:51,126
Zoo mates.

974
00:45:53,504 --> 00:45:54,505
Zoo mates.

975
00:45:57,508 --> 00:45:59,301
See, we're not
so different, Charlie.

976
00:45:59,384 --> 00:46:01,428
<i>You know I tried so long</i>

977
00:46:01,512 --> 00:46:02,930
Come on. Come on!
It's not a big...

978
00:46:03,013 --> 00:46:05,766
<i>Every time I thought
I found it, I was wrong</i>

979
00:46:05,849 --> 00:46:09,520
<i>I swear I must've spent
A thousand nights</i>

980
00:46:09,603 --> 00:46:13,690
<i>Lookin' for somebody
Who could hold me tight</i>

981
00:46:13,774 --> 00:46:16,068
<i>Until I realized</i>

982
00:46:17,319 --> 00:46:19,238
<i>I am the love of
The love of my life...</i>

983
00:46:20,113 --> 00:46:21,657
The Marciano brothers
and Kat Valdez

984
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:23,992
are telling the world
there's no age limit.

985
00:46:24,076 --> 00:46:26,161
-Is that right?
-Guess so.

986
00:46:28,872 --> 00:46:31,291
<i>I am the love of
The love of my life</i>

987
00:46:32,709 --> 00:46:34,503
<i>I am the love of
The love of my life</i>

988
00:46:34,586 --> 00:46:36,171
<i>I was just waiting
For you...</i>

989
00:46:36,255 --> 00:46:37,339
Think we've got everything we need.

990
00:46:37,422 --> 00:46:40,133
We'll post to our socials,
so... you're all set.

991
00:46:40,217 --> 00:46:41,426
All right.

992
00:46:41,927 --> 00:46:44,429
Maybe... Is it okay if I stay?

993
00:46:45,430 --> 00:46:47,808
Oh, yeah. Yeah, of course.

994
00:46:48,141 --> 00:46:49,560
Make yourself at home.

995
00:46:50,143 --> 00:46:53,355
<i>I can't tell you now</i>

996
00:46:53,438 --> 00:46:57,442
<i>I don't know why
Don't know why</i>

997
00:46:57,526 --> 00:47:01,530
<i>And now
I'll pick myself up</i>

998
00:47:01,613 --> 00:47:04,658
<i>One more time
One more time</i>

999
00:47:04,741 --> 00:47:07,578
<i>You know I tried so long</i>

1000
00:47:07,661 --> 00:47:11,039
<i>Every time I thought
I found it, I was wrong...</i>

1001
00:47:11,123 --> 00:47:12,583
-Bye.
-Bye.

1002
00:47:12,666 --> 00:47:14,334
-Hey.
-Hey, Mom.

1003
00:47:15,752 --> 00:47:17,045
How you doing?

1004
00:47:17,129 --> 00:47:18,797
<i>Hold me tight</i>

1005
00:47:19,173 --> 00:47:21,175
<i>Until I realized</i>

1006
00:47:22,593 --> 00:47:24,845
<i>I am the love of
The love of my life...</i>

1007
00:47:24,928 --> 00:47:28,307
There's a picture
of you buying her a pregnancy test.

1008
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:29,516
-Charlie!
-No.

1009
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:31,852
No, that was
a stool softener for Tank.

1010
00:47:32,352 --> 00:47:34,146
<i>I ain't got nobody else
On my mind...</i>

1011
00:47:34,229 --> 00:47:37,399
<i>Kat Valdez and
her new husband, Charlie Gilbert.</i>

1012
00:47:37,482 --> 00:47:39,443
-What do I do?
-Just stand and smile.

1013
00:47:39,526 --> 00:47:41,028
Charlie! Charlie!

1014
00:47:41,111 --> 00:47:43,739
- Oh, my God, it's Bastian!
- Bastian!

1015
00:47:43,822 --> 00:47:46,366
Bastian,
Bastian! Over here!

1016
00:47:47,743 --> 00:47:49,953
Guys, this way.
How about the three of you together?

1017
00:47:50,037 --> 00:47:52,164
No hard feelings, man. Yeah?

1018
00:47:52,247 --> 00:47:54,374
No feelings at all.

1019
00:47:54,917 --> 00:47:56,460
{\an8}Mm. <i>Mamacita.</i>

1020
00:47:56,543 --> 00:47:57,544
{\an8}Bastian, one
with the three of you.

1021
00:48:04,593 --> 00:48:05,594
{\an8}What
did he say to you?

1022
00:48:05,677 --> 00:48:07,095
Kat, Bastian,
Charlie, this way!

1023
00:48:07,179 --> 00:48:08,388
What did he say, Charlie?

1024
00:48:08,472 --> 00:48:09,681
Look, Bastian! Bastian!

1025
00:48:09,765 --> 00:48:10,849
Thank you, guys.

1026
00:48:11,767 --> 00:48:14,811
My Spanish is a little rusty,
but he said,

1027
00:48:14,895 --> 00:48:16,855
"You're the most
beautiful woman I've ever seen.

1028
00:48:16,939 --> 00:48:18,148
"I'm such an idiot.

1029
00:48:18,232 --> 00:48:20,484
"And why did I get
that neck tattoo?"

1030
00:48:22,069 --> 00:48:23,237
You okay?

1031
00:48:25,531 --> 00:48:26,615
I'm good.

1032
00:48:30,494 --> 00:48:32,204
<i>Now, where are you?</i>

1033
00:48:32,287 --> 00:48:33,956
<i>Paris, for a show.</i>

1034
00:48:34,164 --> 00:48:35,332
<i>Oh...</i>

1035
00:48:35,415 --> 00:48:36,750
- Paris!
<i>- Is it weird having</i>

1036
00:48:36,834 --> 00:48:38,961
<i>everyone in the world
know who you are?</i>

1037
00:48:39,044 --> 00:48:42,422
<i>No, what's weird is that everyone in
the world thinks they know who I am.</i>

1038
00:48:42,506 --> 00:48:43,715
<i>Yeah, I bet.</i>

1039
00:48:43,799 --> 00:48:45,926
And you're headed
home after that?

1040
00:48:46,009 --> 00:48:47,636
<i>Well, um, I'm home tomorrow,</i>

1041
00:48:47,719 --> 00:48:49,930
<i>but then I have
that private in Japan.</i>

1042
00:48:50,097 --> 00:48:51,890
What's a private?

1043
00:48:51,974 --> 00:48:54,309
<i>I get paid a fortune
to sing songs</i>

1044
00:48:54,393 --> 00:48:56,812
<i>to like ten insanely rich people.</i>

1045
00:48:56,895 --> 00:48:57,980
<i>Do you think
maybe they'd want</i>

1046
00:48:58,063 --> 00:49:00,190
<i>to watch someone do
some math problems?</i>

1047
00:49:00,274 --> 00:49:02,067
<i>I'll ask.</i>

1048
00:49:02,150 --> 00:49:04,236
<i>All right,
well, I'll let you go,</i>

1049
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:06,280
<i>but call me if you're lonely.</i>

1050
00:49:09,116 --> 00:49:10,117
Hello?

1051
00:49:10,617 --> 00:49:11,702
<i>I'm lonely.</i>

1052
00:49:13,745 --> 00:49:16,081
It's been like 13 seconds.

1053
00:49:16,623 --> 00:49:18,417
<i>Are you brushing your teeth?</i>

1054
00:49:18,792 --> 00:49:20,586
-Yes.
<i>-Are you going to bed?</i>

1055
00:49:20,669 --> 00:49:23,213
<i>It's like 8:00 p.m. there.</i>

1056
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:24,673
Um...

1057
00:49:25,007 --> 00:49:27,050
<i>-Maybe.
</i>-Wow.

1058
00:49:27,134 --> 00:49:29,761
Well, I'm gonna read.
I'm not gonna go right to bed.

1059
00:49:30,470 --> 00:49:32,931
-How's Lou?
-She's really good.

1060
00:49:33,015 --> 00:49:35,350
She finally agreed
to join the math club,

1061
00:49:35,434 --> 00:49:38,187
which makes me happy,
'cause she's phenomenal at math

1062
00:49:38,270 --> 00:49:39,855
even though she doesn't
want to be.

1063
00:49:39,938 --> 00:49:41,481
Well, maybe she just
doesn't want to be you.

1064
00:49:41,565 --> 00:49:42,608
<i>That's for certain.</i>

1065
00:49:42,691 --> 00:49:44,067
But it's not really that.

1066
00:49:44,151 --> 00:49:46,695
It's more that she's afraid, and,

1067
00:49:46,778 --> 00:49:49,531
you know, she almost won
the Mathalon when she was 11.

1068
00:49:49,615 --> 00:49:51,033
-The Mathalon?
<i>-Yeah, the Mathalon.</i>

1069
00:49:51,116 --> 00:49:52,826
It's kind of like
the Grammys for math,

1070
00:49:52,910 --> 00:49:54,995
<i>except there's like
four people in the audience.</i>

1071
00:49:55,162 --> 00:49:58,040
-Ah.
<i>-She kind of froze in the finals,</i>

1072
00:49:58,123 --> 00:50:01,376
and then some kids
made fun of her and...

1073
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:03,170
I just want her to find her place.

1074
00:50:03,253 --> 00:50:05,589
Just give her a minute.

1075
00:50:05,672 --> 00:50:07,174
<i>Yeah, definitely.</i>

1076
00:50:07,591 --> 00:50:10,344
Okay, well, I'm glad you were lonely.

1077
00:50:12,262 --> 00:50:14,181
I guess I'll let you get to bed now.

1078
00:50:14,264 --> 00:50:16,183
<i>-Bye.
</i>-Okay.

1079
00:50:16,266 --> 00:50:17,851
<i>So long. Adios.</i>

1080
00:50:17,935 --> 00:50:19,978
Bye.

1081
00:50:20,062 --> 00:50:21,188
<i>See you.</i>

1082
00:50:28,779 --> 00:50:29,947
Yeah.

1083
00:50:33,742 --> 00:50:36,703
Okay, after you've completed
the prime factorization,

1084
00:50:36,787 --> 00:50:38,914
identify the distinct prime factor.

1085
00:50:38,997 --> 00:50:41,124
All right, listen up, Coolidge Pi-thons.

1086
00:50:41,208 --> 00:50:42,876
-I'm here on official business.
-Park...

1087
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:45,587
First of all,
who didn't get their waiver signed?

1088
00:50:46,296 --> 00:50:47,422
All right, you two, out.

1089
00:50:47,506 --> 00:50:48,882
Hey, you can't just dismiss my students.

1090
00:50:48,966 --> 00:50:50,676
Yes, I can.

1091
00:50:50,759 --> 00:50:52,928
You heard me. Scram. Beat it!

1092
00:50:54,638 --> 00:50:58,517
Now, for the rest of you
who know how to follow direction,

1093
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:01,603
I bring you the one, the only...

1094
00:51:06,650 --> 00:51:07,943
Kat, I love you!

1095
00:51:08,026 --> 00:51:10,237
Percy, stop yelling. She's right here.

1096
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:11,321
Hi.

1097
00:51:11,405 --> 00:51:14,074
Thought you had a private
for, like, a fortune.

1098
00:51:14,408 --> 00:51:16,076
I rescheduled.

1099
00:51:16,159 --> 00:51:18,412
All right, who's got
a question for Kat?

1100
00:51:18,495 --> 00:51:19,621
-I do!
-Me!

1101
00:51:19,705 --> 00:51:22,249
Say something smart.
Don't embarrass me.

1102
00:51:22,332 --> 00:51:23,333
Uh, George.

1103
00:51:23,417 --> 00:51:24,960
Did you really kiss Katy Perry?

1104
00:51:25,043 --> 00:51:26,253
Actually, she kissed me.

1105
00:51:26,503 --> 00:51:27,504
Ooh.

1106
00:51:27,588 --> 00:51:28,589
- Next.
- Oh!

1107
00:51:28,672 --> 00:51:30,007
Uh, not George.

1108
00:51:30,090 --> 00:51:31,216
-Spencer.
-Don't care.

1109
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:34,052
Why is Mr. Gilbert better than Bastian?

1110
00:51:35,304 --> 00:51:36,305
Well...

1111
00:51:37,764 --> 00:51:39,558
he didn't cheat on me
with my assistant.

1112
00:51:39,850 --> 00:51:42,102
Ooh.

1113
00:51:42,186 --> 00:51:44,229
Okay, you guys caught us
right in the middle

1114
00:51:44,313 --> 00:51:46,732
of our mock Mathalon training,

1115
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:49,610
which you're welcome to stay
and enjoy for a little bit.

1116
00:51:49,693 --> 00:51:51,445
Uh, Lou, you're up.

1117
00:51:51,528 --> 00:51:53,697
- Dad, no.
- Is that Lou?

1118
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:55,115
Yeah.

1119
00:51:55,199 --> 00:51:57,993
Finally. Hi.

1120
00:51:58,076 --> 00:52:00,704
-I've wanted to meet you forever.
-Me, too.

1121
00:52:00,787 --> 00:52:02,706
Are you kidding me?
They haven't met?

1122
00:52:02,789 --> 00:52:04,499
-No.
-What is wrong with you?

1123
00:52:04,583 --> 00:52:06,752
- Well, they...
- You're married.

1124
00:52:06,835 --> 00:52:08,378
Can we forget about
the mock Mathalon?

1125
00:52:08,462 --> 00:52:10,631
I have a million
questions for Kat.

1126
00:52:10,714 --> 00:52:12,966
Yeah, and Lou's too scared to
get up in front of people anyways.

1127
00:52:13,050 --> 00:52:14,510
Shut up, Jose.

1128
00:52:14,885 --> 00:52:16,887
Oh, well, don't worry.
I totally get it.

1129
00:52:16,970 --> 00:52:19,264
You know, sometimes
when I have to get up in front of an arena

1130
00:52:19,348 --> 00:52:23,060
with thousands and thousands
of people, I get so nervous.

1131
00:52:23,143 --> 00:52:25,979
No, I'm serious. I'm afraid I'll choke.

1132
00:52:26,647 --> 00:52:29,650
Okay, Mel, pull up "Kat VMAs 2010."

1133
00:52:29,733 --> 00:52:30,984
-I've got it.
-Okay.

1134
00:52:31,068 --> 00:52:32,444
-Hey, Google.
-Look at this.

1135
00:52:32,528 --> 00:52:37,241
Show me a video,
"Kat Valdez 2010 VMA performance."

1136
00:52:37,616 --> 00:52:41,453
{\an8}<i>Number nine, yeah
I'm going up</i>

1137
00:52:41,537 --> 00:52:43,830
{\an8}<i>I'm getting so high</i>

1138
00:52:43,914 --> 00:52:46,166
{\an8}<i>I'm not the sa...</i>

1139
00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:48,502
{\an8}Hey, Google. That's enough.

1140
00:52:50,003 --> 00:52:51,129
Yeah.

1141
00:52:52,005 --> 00:52:54,758
I forgot the lyrics on live TV

1142
00:52:54,842 --> 00:52:56,885
to a song that I wrote.

1143
00:52:56,969 --> 00:52:58,428
It could happen to anybody.

1144
00:52:58,512 --> 00:53:00,597
Yeah, but the point is
that once it does,

1145
00:53:00,681 --> 00:53:03,100
you're always worried, you know?

1146
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:04,726
What if it happens again?

1147
00:53:04,810 --> 00:53:06,144
What did you do?

1148
00:53:06,228 --> 00:53:07,771
I shifted focus.

1149
00:53:08,522 --> 00:53:09,731
I made my dance so hard

1150
00:53:09,815 --> 00:53:12,192
that all I could do
was concentrate on the steps.

1151
00:53:12,818 --> 00:53:15,779
So, it's like
you distracted your mind.

1152
00:53:15,863 --> 00:53:17,489
Yes. Exactly.

1153
00:53:17,573 --> 00:53:21,368
Concentrating on the dance steps made me
forget how scared I was.

1154
00:53:25,038 --> 00:53:27,291
Mel, we're gonna need
some speakers.

1155
00:53:29,418 --> 00:53:31,170
Not too loud, right?

1156
00:53:31,628 --> 00:53:33,589
<i>I just got paid...</i>

1157
00:53:33,672 --> 00:53:34,673
Hey!

1158
00:53:34,756 --> 00:53:35,966
And two.

1159
00:53:36,717 --> 00:53:38,510
And free your mind,
and three and four.

1160
00:53:38,594 --> 00:53:40,804
Make a turn, three and four.

1161
00:53:40,888 --> 00:53:42,472
Again, three and four.

1162
00:53:43,182 --> 00:53:44,266
And three and hour.

1163
00:53:44,349 --> 00:53:46,268
And one and two,
and three and four.

1164
00:53:46,351 --> 00:53:48,645
And ask a question,
three and four.

1165
00:53:50,606 --> 00:53:52,608
Look alive, Chuck,
three and four.

1166
00:53:52,691 --> 00:53:54,234
Oh, uh, okay.

1167
00:53:54,318 --> 00:53:56,737
Lou, what is 43 times 101?

1168
00:53:56,820 --> 00:53:58,822
-4-3-4-3.
-Yes!

1169
00:53:58,906 --> 00:54:00,490
Yes, you're on fire. Yes!

1170
00:54:00,574 --> 00:54:02,409
You're ruining it, Charlie,
three and four.

1171
00:54:02,492 --> 00:54:04,161
Keep the time,
and three and four.

1172
00:54:04,244 --> 00:54:05,245
And turn.

1173
00:54:05,329 --> 00:54:08,081
Esther,
what is five factorial?

1174
00:54:08,165 --> 00:54:10,000
Uh, 120.

1175
00:54:10,083 --> 00:54:11,084
Yeah!

1176
00:54:11,168 --> 00:54:13,337
All geniuses with rhythm.

1177
00:54:15,464 --> 00:54:16,965
<i>I just got paid...</i>

<i>I just got paid</i>

1193

What are the words?

1194
00:55:12,688 --> 00:55:15,357
Uh... I haven't figured that out yet.

1195
00:55:16,608 --> 00:55:19,111
And, actually, the more I try,
the harder it gets.

1196
00:55:21,154 --> 00:55:24,658
You know, when I can't
figure out homework stuff,

1197
00:55:25,450 --> 00:55:28,245
my dad says,
"If you sit in the question,

1198
00:55:28,328 --> 00:55:29,997
"the answer finds you."

1199
00:55:30,289 --> 00:55:31,373
Hmm.

1200
00:55:31,456 --> 00:55:32,499
And does it?

1201
00:55:33,250 --> 00:55:34,334
I don't know. I...

1202
00:55:34,877 --> 00:55:35,961
I don't sit long enough.

1203
00:55:36,044 --> 00:55:37,921
Yeah.

1204
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:39,798
That's my problem, too.

1205
00:55:44,428 --> 00:55:47,514
So, do you like my dad?

1206
00:55:48,557 --> 00:55:50,851
I mean, he can be so annoying,

1207
00:55:50,934 --> 00:55:54,104
but he's also, like,
really smart and nice.

1208
00:55:55,022 --> 00:55:57,649
You know, your dad says
you're the best thing about him.

1209
00:55:58,233 --> 00:56:00,194
That's probably true.

1210
00:56:00,277 --> 00:56:01,778
Let's put it right over here.

1211
00:56:03,322 --> 00:56:04,406
Whoa.

1212
00:56:04,615 --> 00:56:06,742
-Is all this stuff for you?
-Coach.

1213
00:56:06,825 --> 00:56:08,660
Is this another endorsement deal?

1214
00:56:08,744 --> 00:56:09,995
No.

1215
00:56:10,287 --> 00:56:12,706
They're donating merchandise
to Dress for Success,

1216
00:56:12,789 --> 00:56:14,791
which is a charity that I work with.

1217
00:56:14,875 --> 00:56:16,210
That's awesome.

1218
00:56:17,419 --> 00:56:18,420
You like?

1219
00:56:18,795 --> 00:56:19,838
I love.

1220
00:56:24,384 --> 00:56:26,178
-No way.
-Yeah.

1221
00:56:26,512 --> 00:56:27,679
Can I?

1222
00:56:28,305 --> 00:56:29,723
Don't worry. I'll pay them back.

1223
00:56:31,558 --> 00:56:32,559
-Okay, come on.
-Thank you.

1224
00:56:32,643 --> 00:56:34,895
You got another bag in here
with some textbooks.

1225
00:56:37,272 --> 00:56:39,191
- Thank you.
- Are you kidding?

1226
00:56:39,274 --> 00:56:40,442
I love it.

1227
00:56:42,069 --> 00:56:44,488
-I got to get her home.
-What?

1228
00:56:44,821 --> 00:56:46,949
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Already? No.

1229
00:56:48,116 --> 00:56:49,117
Okay.

1230
00:56:50,244 --> 00:56:51,328
I love Keats.

1231
00:56:56,875 --> 00:56:58,001
Oh...

1232
00:56:58,293 --> 00:57:00,254
Wha... Stop.
What are you doing?

1233
00:57:00,337 --> 00:57:02,840
- I killed it.
- It's not...

1234
00:57:02,923 --> 00:57:04,341
Listen, I'm gonna say something

1235
00:57:04,424 --> 00:57:07,845
that's probably gonna
come out completely wrong,

1236
00:57:07,928 --> 00:57:11,473
but you're beautiful
without all of that.

1237
00:57:11,557 --> 00:57:13,267
I mean, either way, you're...

1238
00:57:14,184 --> 00:57:15,477
good to go.

1239
00:57:15,936 --> 00:57:17,104
Good to go?

1240
00:57:17,187 --> 00:57:18,814
Good to go.

1241
00:57:18,939 --> 00:57:21,191
Okay, I'll take it.

1242
00:57:24,695 --> 00:57:26,280
You're a great teacher, Charlie.

1243
00:57:28,073 --> 00:57:30,409
Those kids, they're lucky to have you.

1244
00:57:31,326 --> 00:57:33,370
I don't know, hanging
with you guys today made me

1245
00:57:33,453 --> 00:57:35,622
feel kind of normal.

1246
00:57:35,706 --> 00:57:38,041
Wheels up for Puerto Rico at 7:00.

1247
00:57:39,543 --> 00:57:42,379
Oh, my bad.
I thought you were by yourself.

1248
00:57:46,758 --> 00:57:47,885
Puerto Rico.

1249
00:57:50,762 --> 00:57:55,225
Um, my friends, they have
a bed-and-breakfast there, so...

1250
00:57:56,018 --> 00:57:57,144
That's...

1251
00:57:58,478 --> 00:58:00,189
Listen, if... if...

1252
00:58:00,272 --> 00:58:03,984
If Bastian is the guy
that you think you're supposed to be with,

1253
00:58:04,067 --> 00:58:07,779
then, hell, I'll drive you to the airport.

1254
00:58:08,530 --> 00:58:10,449
But if you're not sure...

1255
00:58:11,950 --> 00:58:13,368
then come with me

1256
00:58:13,452 --> 00:58:15,913
to the fall semiformal
tomorrow night.

1257
00:58:16,538 --> 00:58:18,624
Yeah, they need chaperones.

1258
00:58:19,625 --> 00:58:21,460
Maybe you need chaperoning.

1259
00:58:22,961 --> 00:58:25,797
Listen, I'm not saying this as your
husband or even as your friend,

1260
00:58:25,881 --> 00:58:27,382
because technically
I'm not either,

1261
00:58:27,466 --> 00:58:31,386
but if you go back to Bastian,
aren't you just making

1262
00:58:31,470 --> 00:58:34,640
the same mistake
all over again... again?

1263
00:58:43,982 --> 00:58:46,193
Are you asking me to the school dance?

1264
00:58:47,986 --> 00:58:49,780
Well, I could leave a note in your locker,

1265
00:58:49,863 --> 00:58:52,241
but here we are in free period,

1266
00:58:52,324 --> 00:58:55,035
so I figured I'd take my shot.

1267
00:59:05,546 --> 00:59:06,755
Welcome.

1268
00:59:08,674 --> 00:59:10,676
Excuse me. Oh, wait, wait, wait.

1269
00:59:10,759 --> 00:59:12,970
Come on. Okay.

1270
00:59:13,053 --> 00:59:14,304
Can I have your left wrist?

1271
00:59:14,388 --> 00:59:15,681
My left wr... Okay.

1272
00:59:19,393 --> 00:59:21,270
Oh, my God.

1273
00:59:21,562 --> 00:59:22,563
How sweet.

1274
00:59:22,646 --> 00:59:25,983
Oh, and I also got you this to give me.

1275
00:59:27,693 --> 00:59:29,027
So thank you very much.

1276
00:59:29,111 --> 00:59:31,029
-I'm glad I thought of that.
-It's my favorite.

1277
00:59:33,740 --> 00:59:35,492
You look in...

1278
00:59:36,952 --> 00:59:38,078
You look...

1279
00:59:38,370 --> 00:59:39,621
Let's go to the dance.

1280
00:59:41,206 --> 00:59:44,751
Out of respect
for Mr. and Mrs. Gilbert-hyphen-Valdez,

1281
00:59:44,835 --> 00:59:47,629
we would like the gym
to be a photo-free zone,

1282
00:59:47,713 --> 00:59:50,299
so please check your phones
at the door.

1283
00:59:53,302 --> 00:59:54,928
You did all this for me?

1284
00:59:55,179 --> 00:59:57,055
I might've had a little help.

1285
00:59:59,766 --> 01:00:01,268
You know what, Kofi,
why don't you take the night off?

1286
01:00:01,351 --> 01:00:02,352
I'll let you know when I need you.

1287
01:00:02,436 --> 01:00:03,687
All right. Have a good time, y'all.

1288
01:00:03,770 --> 01:00:04,855
Okay. All right.

1289
01:00:05,981 --> 01:00:07,149
Unsupervised.

1290
01:00:07,524 --> 01:00:09,359
I'm gonna screen-grab
your search history

1291
01:00:09,443 --> 01:00:10,611
and send it to your mother.

1292
01:00:10,694 --> 01:00:11,862
That's a guarantee.

1293
01:00:15,199 --> 01:00:16,700
-Hey.
-Hey.

1294
01:00:16,783 --> 01:00:18,452
-How are you?
-Good to see you.

1295
01:00:20,746 --> 01:00:22,206
Kill the music!

1296
01:00:22,581 --> 01:00:25,959
A-one, two, three, four. Hit it.

1297
01:00:26,043 --> 01:00:28,378
<i>Marry me, marry me
Say yes</i>

1298
01:00:28,462 --> 01:00:30,881
<i>Marry me, marry me
Say yes...</i>

1299
01:00:30,964 --> 01:00:32,132
What are you doing?

1300
01:00:32,216 --> 01:00:35,385
You know, kids opening for
pop stars is very big these days.

1301
01:00:35,469 --> 01:00:36,803
<i>I've never
Seen forever...</i>

1302
01:00:36,887 --> 01:00:39,306
When did the glee club
learn <i>Marry Me?</i>

1303
01:00:39,389 --> 01:00:41,767
When Charlie Gilbert
became Charlie Valdez.

1304
01:00:41,850 --> 01:00:43,977
-I'm hungry, Mr. Pitts.
-Keep singing!

1305
01:00:44,061 --> 01:00:45,479
You're an inspiration, Pitts.

1306
01:00:45,562 --> 01:00:46,897
Right back at you, Gilbert.

1307
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:48,690
Oh, my God,
they are so adorable.

1308
01:00:48,774 --> 01:00:49,900
Thank you.

1309
01:00:49,983 --> 01:00:51,360
If you could.

1310
01:00:51,818 --> 01:00:53,403
<i>...tried</i>

1311
01:00:53,487 --> 01:00:54,905
Yeah, okay.

1312
01:00:54,988 --> 01:00:58,116
"To Jonathan Gregory Pitts,

1313
01:00:58,492 --> 01:01:01,286
"a fellow architect of song."

1314
01:01:01,370 --> 01:01:04,456
Okay, let her
breathe just a little bit.

1315
01:01:04,540 --> 01:01:05,541
Come on.

1316
01:01:05,624 --> 01:01:06,750
-<i>Ring, ring, ring
</i>-<i>Ring, ring</i>

1317
01:01:06,834 --> 01:01:08,168
<i>Church bells, let 'em ring
Ring, ring...</i>

1318
01:01:08,252 --> 01:01:09,253
Love and light.

1319
01:01:09,336 --> 01:01:11,004
-Love and light.
-Okay. Cut!

1320
01:01:11,088 --> 01:01:12,798
-<i>Tonight, tonight
</i>-Bring the music back!

1321
01:01:13,006 --> 01:01:15,759
<i>Keep me satisfied...</i>

1322
01:01:19,012 --> 01:01:21,306
So, do we have a job?

1323
01:01:21,390 --> 01:01:22,891
Do we have duties? What do we do?

1324
01:01:22,975 --> 01:01:24,852
Yes, we do. We got to monitor.

1325
01:01:24,935 --> 01:01:27,312
We got to guide. We got to encourage.

1326
01:01:27,396 --> 01:01:29,022
-Okay.
-We might have to discourage.

1327
01:01:29,106 --> 01:01:31,316
We might have to separate.

1328
01:01:31,650 --> 01:01:34,570
And maybe later... Mm, dance?

1329
01:01:34,653 --> 01:01:36,321
I don't think you want to see that.

1330
01:01:36,405 --> 01:01:38,824
Oh, I do. I do want to see that.

1331
01:01:38,907 --> 01:01:40,492
Did you see my corsage?

1332
01:01:40,576 --> 01:01:41,702
I did.

1333
01:01:49,042 --> 01:01:50,085
Hey!

1334
01:01:50,377 --> 01:01:51,879
Aah!

1335
01:01:53,755 --> 01:01:55,090
Oh, yeah, I want to do one.

1336
01:01:55,174 --> 01:01:56,758
-Ready? Okay.
-Yep.

1337
01:02:02,973 --> 01:02:03,974
Hold this.

1338
01:02:04,057 --> 01:02:05,184
What are you doing?

1339
01:02:06,435 --> 01:02:07,436
A private.

1340
01:02:13,692 --> 01:02:15,110
Hey, everybody.

1341
01:02:16,945 --> 01:02:19,239
This is my first semiformal,

1342
01:02:19,323 --> 01:02:20,490
and, uh...

1343
01:02:21,158 --> 01:02:23,118
I just want to thank you guys
for letting me crash.

1344
01:02:23,202 --> 01:02:24,620
We love you, Kat!

1345
01:02:24,912 --> 01:02:28,207
Thank you, Parker. Love you, too.

1346
01:02:29,041 --> 01:02:30,501
You guys mind if I do a song?

1347
01:02:30,709 --> 01:02:33,587
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1348
01:02:34,254 --> 01:02:36,757
I actually wrote this song
when I was about your age.

1349
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:38,300
It was on my very first album.

1350
01:02:38,383 --> 01:02:40,219
It's called <i>After Love.</i>

1351
01:02:40,302 --> 01:02:41,386
You guys may not know it.

1352
01:02:41,470 --> 01:02:43,305
- I do!
- Oh...

1353
01:02:43,388 --> 01:02:45,057
Do you want to come
up here and do it with me?

1354
01:02:46,517 --> 01:02:48,477
-You play?
-Y-yeah.

1355
01:02:48,685 --> 01:02:49,770
Let's do it.

1356
01:02:54,441 --> 01:02:58,028
Give it up for a fellow
architect of song, Mr. Pitts.

1357
01:03:00,447 --> 01:03:02,032
-Pitts!
-Mr. Pitts!

1358
01:03:04,660 --> 01:03:05,661
Ready?

1359
01:03:06,745 --> 01:03:07,788
Three, four.

1360
01:03:07,955 --> 01:03:09,498
<i>Long nights in your car</i>

1361
01:03:09,581 --> 01:03:11,583
<i>Mornings in your arms</i>

1362
01:03:12,042 --> 01:03:13,794
<i>From five-hour calls</i>

1363
01:03:13,877 --> 01:03:15,879
<i>To nothing at all</i>

1364
01:03:16,296 --> 01:03:18,006
<i>I guess I missed the signs</i>

1365
01:03:18,090 --> 01:03:20,676
<i>The writing
On the wall, ooh</i>

1366
01:03:20,759 --> 01:03:23,262
<i>Don't know where
It all went wrong</i>

1367
01:03:23,929 --> 01:03:28,350
<i>But if this is how
It's got to be</i>

1368
01:03:28,433 --> 01:03:33,146
<i>I need someone to tell me
Tell me, tell me, tell me</i>

1369
01:03:33,230 --> 01:03:35,732
<i>What comes after love?</i>

1370
01:03:35,816 --> 01:03:40,362
<i>I want to know there's
Something for me after us</i>

1371
01:03:40,445 --> 01:03:44,658
<i>I don't think my heart
Was made to break this much</i>

1372
01:03:44,741 --> 01:03:48,829
<i>Tell me there's a
Happy ever after love</i>

1373
01:03:48,912 --> 01:03:53,417
<i>Tell me there's a
Happy ever after us</i>

1374
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:57,045
<i>I believe, I believe</i>

1375
01:03:57,129 --> 01:03:59,214
<i>I believe in love</i>

1376
01:03:59,298 --> 01:04:03,385
<i>Even if, even if
It wasn't meant for us</i>

1377
01:04:03,468 --> 01:04:07,890
<i> I believe, I believe
I believe in love</i>

1378
01:04:07,973 --> 01:04:09,725
<i>I just need someone
To tell me</i>

1379
01:04:09,808 --> 01:04:11,518
<i>Tell me, tell me, tell me</i>

1380
01:04:11,602 --> 01:04:13,979
<i>What comes after love?</i>

1381
01:04:14,062 --> 01:04:18,609
<i>I want to know there's
Something for me after us</i>

1382
01:04:18,692 --> 01:04:22,821
<i>I don't think my heart
Was made to break this much</i>

1383
01:04:22,905 --> 01:04:27,075
<i>Tell me there's a
Happy ever after love</i>

1384
01:04:27,159 --> 01:04:31,371
<i>Tell me there's a
Happy ever after us</i>

1385
01:04:43,425 --> 01:04:46,303
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1386
01:04:46,512 --> 01:04:48,222
<i> Thank you guys so much!</i>

1387
01:04:49,556 --> 01:04:52,100
Well, that is my new favorite song.

1388
01:04:54,186 --> 01:04:56,271
What was your old favorite song?

1389
01:04:57,397 --> 01:04:59,316
I don't know, this might be

1390
01:04:59,399 --> 01:05:02,778
a little too edgy for you to handle,

1391
01:05:02,861 --> 01:05:05,405
but when my mom was sick,
we watched a lot of musicals,

1392
01:05:05,489 --> 01:05:07,324
and her favorite was <i>Camelot.</i>

1393
01:05:07,658 --> 01:05:08,659
Hmm.

1394
01:05:08,742 --> 01:05:10,327
You know, it was like <i>Game of Thrones,</i>

1395
01:05:10,410 --> 01:05:12,329
but less nudity and murder.

1396
01:05:12,412 --> 01:05:14,456
More music and velvet.

1397
01:05:16,333 --> 01:05:19,586
But, anyway, when Lancelot wants to
tell Guinevere how he feels,

1398
01:05:19,670 --> 01:05:22,381
instead of saying,
"I want to be with you,"

1399
01:05:22,464 --> 01:05:25,133
he says,
"We're gonna split up. It's inevitable."

1400
01:05:26,385 --> 01:05:27,511
That's a little depressing.

1401
01:05:27,594 --> 01:05:29,596
No, not when you hear it.

1402
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:33,308
"If ever I were to leave you,
it wouldn't be in summer."

1403
01:05:33,392 --> 01:05:37,312
<i>If ever I would leave you</i>

1404
01:05:38,272 --> 01:05:42,526
<i>It wouldn't be in summer</i>

1405
01:05:42,609 --> 01:05:45,946
<i>Seeing you in summer
I never would go</i>

1406
01:05:46,029 --> 01:05:47,906
-It's nice.
-Yeah.

1407
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:53,662
<i>Your hair streaked
With sunlight</i>

1408
01:05:53,745 --> 01:05:55,539
<i>Your lips red as flame...</i>

1409
01:05:55,622 --> 01:05:57,541
-Dance with me.
-No, I don't dance.

1410
01:05:57,624 --> 01:05:59,877
Come on. Dance with me.

1411
01:06:02,129 --> 01:06:03,422
Just a little bit.

1412
01:06:05,966 --> 01:06:07,384
There we go.

1413
01:06:09,052 --> 01:06:12,598
<i>How could it be in autumn?</i>

1414
01:06:12,681 --> 01:06:14,975
<i>How I'd leave in autumn</i>

1415
01:06:15,058 --> 01:06:19,146
<i>I never would know...</i>

1416
01:06:19,771 --> 01:06:22,482
Shouldn't we be listening
to Barry White, or Drake...

1417
01:06:22,566 --> 01:06:26,862
or whatever it is you listen to
when you're about to, you know...

1418
01:06:26,945 --> 01:06:28,113
To what?

1419
01:06:29,740 --> 01:06:30,949
Well...

1420
01:06:32,743 --> 01:06:36,538
Well, I don't want to presume that I'm
about to have the best night of my life,

1421
01:06:36,622 --> 01:06:40,501
but if I am, I don't want
to do it to Robert Goulet.

1422
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:44,171
I like it.

1423
01:06:44,838 --> 01:06:45,839
You do?

1424
01:06:45,923 --> 01:06:48,383
<i>When you catch
The fire's glow</i>

1425
01:06:48,467 --> 01:06:49,635
A lot.

1426
01:06:51,261 --> 01:06:55,641
<i>If ever I would leave you</i>

1427
01:06:56,058 --> 01:06:59,603
<i>How could it be in springtime</i>

1428
01:07:00,103 --> 01:07:07,110
<i>Knowing how in spring
I'm bewitched by you so?</i>

1429
01:07:07,569 --> 01:07:11,323
<i>Oh, no
Not in springtime...</i>

1430
01:07:11,740 --> 01:07:13,158
Is this smart?

1431
01:07:15,244 --> 01:07:17,746
I think we left smart six weeks ago.

1432
01:07:59,079 --> 01:08:01,290
-Morning.
-Morning.

1433
01:08:03,166 --> 01:08:05,544
Thank God you're here.

1434
01:08:06,044 --> 01:08:09,464
'Cause I did have
just a minute of...

1435
01:08:09,548 --> 01:08:12,467
"Is she gone? Did she leave?"

1436
01:08:12,551 --> 01:08:15,179
I was like, "God, just...

1437
01:08:15,262 --> 01:08:17,848
"I know you rock stars move fast,

1438
01:08:17,930 --> 01:08:20,309
"on to the next town, like, just..."

1439
01:08:20,392 --> 01:08:22,102
God. Here, take it.

1440
01:08:23,437 --> 01:08:24,438
Hey.

1441
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:25,814
<i> Hey, how was last night?</i>

1442
01:08:25,898 --> 01:08:28,483
-Amazing.
-<i>Wait. Where are you?</i>

1443
01:08:28,567 --> 01:08:30,944
-<i>Are you with, uh...
</i>-Yeah. Charlie.

1444
01:08:31,028 --> 01:08:32,738
-<i>Still?
</i>-Still.

1445
01:08:35,365 --> 01:08:36,783
"Charlie. Still."

1446
01:08:36,867 --> 01:08:38,911
Let's just
move that to Tuesday.

1447
01:08:38,993 --> 01:08:41,913
-<i>But they're expecting you.
</i>-Sorry. Just tell 'em no.

1448
01:08:42,706 --> 01:08:44,124
-<i>Okay.
</i>-Okay.

1449
01:08:44,207 --> 01:08:45,709
I'll call you later.

1450
01:08:46,167 --> 01:08:48,921
Did I hear you just
rearranging your day for me?

1451
01:08:49,755 --> 01:08:50,881
Maybe.

1452
01:08:51,423 --> 01:08:52,841
And you're welcome.

1453
01:08:53,425 --> 01:08:54,510
Thank you.

1454
01:08:55,676 --> 01:08:56,886
You and your mom?

1455
01:08:56,970 --> 01:08:58,346
Yeah, at Coney Island.

1456
01:08:58,430 --> 01:08:59,430
The Wonder Wheel.

1457
01:08:59,515 --> 01:09:01,850
Well, we actually called it
"The wishing wheel."

1458
01:09:01,934 --> 01:09:03,810
Yeah. We loved going out there.

1459
01:09:03,894 --> 01:09:05,729
Although the last time
that I took her out there,

1460
01:09:05,812 --> 01:09:07,481
it was closed, 'cause it was winter.

1461
01:09:07,564 --> 01:09:09,691
It was, like, right before
she passed away.

1462
01:09:09,774 --> 01:09:11,193
-I'm sorry.
-No, no.

1463
01:09:11,276 --> 01:09:13,654
It's okay. I like talking about her.

1464
01:09:13,737 --> 01:09:17,823
It happened a while ago
when Lou was like five, but...

1465
01:09:18,908 --> 01:09:23,080
they definitely got to spend
some good times together.

1466
01:09:23,162 --> 01:09:26,041
And it's crazy how much
of her I see in Lou.

1467
01:09:26,582 --> 01:09:28,460
You think she would've liked me?

1468
01:09:28,544 --> 01:09:30,504
- No.
- What?

1469
01:09:30,587 --> 01:09:32,005
Yes, she would've loved you.

1470
01:09:32,089 --> 01:09:33,924
She would've thought
you were amazing.

1471
01:09:34,006 --> 01:09:36,051
I mean, she might have
questioned a few things.

1472
01:09:36,134 --> 01:09:37,426
She was very...

1473
01:09:38,136 --> 01:09:39,763
Well, she was very self-sufficient.

1474
01:09:40,930 --> 01:09:43,350
Well, I'm, like, the most
self-sufficient person on the planet.

1475
01:09:43,433 --> 01:09:45,519
-I mean, I do more things in one day--
-No, I know.

1476
01:09:45,602 --> 01:09:46,979
I know you do. I'm not saying that.

1477
01:09:47,062 --> 01:09:50,023
I'm saying you have a lot of people,
you know, kind of handling things.

1478
01:09:50,107 --> 01:09:52,317
There's nothing wrong
with having help.

1479
01:09:52,401 --> 01:09:53,777
I mean, it doesn't mean
I'm helpless.

1480
01:09:53,861 --> 01:09:55,737
It just means that I have
a lot of things on my plate.

1481
01:09:55,821 --> 01:09:58,782
I know, but you might not need
as many people helping you

1482
01:09:58,866 --> 01:10:00,242
as you think you do.

1483
01:10:00,659 --> 01:10:02,160
So, what are you saying?

1484
01:10:02,911 --> 01:10:05,539
You want me to try being alone?

1485
01:10:05,622 --> 01:10:06,957
Because I could go
be alone right now.

1486
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:08,584
No, no, no, uh, let's be clear.

1487
01:10:08,667 --> 01:10:11,879
"Alone" means without help,
not alone without me.

1488
01:10:12,421 --> 01:10:13,463
Wait.

1489
01:10:14,381 --> 01:10:16,008
Is this a challenge?

1490
01:10:16,091 --> 01:10:17,092
Now you get it.

1491
01:10:17,176 --> 01:10:19,052
-What, are you challenging me?
-Yeah. Oh, yeah.

1492
01:10:19,136 --> 01:10:21,930
Yeah, but let's make it
a real challenge, okay?

1493
01:10:22,014 --> 01:10:24,057
-Okay.
-That means without doormen.

1494
01:10:24,141 --> 01:10:26,101
-Without yes-Melissa.
-Fine.

1495
01:10:26,185 --> 01:10:27,394
Without cooks,

1496
01:10:27,477 --> 01:10:29,438
without cleaners,
without hair extenders.

1497
01:10:29,521 --> 01:10:31,523
Yeah, this is serious.

1498
01:10:31,607 --> 01:10:32,983
Without live-feeding.

1499
01:10:33,066 --> 01:10:35,402
Without constant
filming updates.

1500
01:10:35,485 --> 01:10:37,738
Without all that
little stuff. Gone.

1501
01:10:38,238 --> 01:10:39,990
Okay. I can do that.

1502
01:10:40,073 --> 01:10:42,201
-Okay.
-What are you gonna do?

1503
01:10:42,284 --> 01:10:43,994
Me? I'm... You know,
I'm gonna be there.

1504
01:10:44,077 --> 01:10:45,162
I'm gonna monitor.

1505
01:10:45,245 --> 01:10:46,371
Mm-mm.

1506
01:10:46,496 --> 01:10:47,581
Nice try, buddy.

1507
01:10:47,664 --> 01:10:49,333
- Okay.
- What?

1508
01:10:51,126 --> 01:10:52,544
You're gonna get on social media.

1509
01:10:52,628 --> 01:10:53,712
-No.
-Yes.

1510
01:10:53,795 --> 01:10:55,297
Come on, that's... This is about you.

1511
01:10:55,380 --> 01:10:56,632
You're gonna go on social media.

1512
01:10:56,715 --> 01:10:58,133
You're gonna have Snapchat

1513
01:10:58,217 --> 01:11:00,093
and Instagram and TikTok.

1514
01:11:00,177 --> 01:11:02,095
-You're gonna do a dance! Yes!
-This is about you.

1515
01:11:02,179 --> 01:11:03,430
-Don't flip it.
-No, listen.

1516
01:11:03,514 --> 01:11:05,140
Why are you so judgmental?

1517
01:11:05,224 --> 01:11:06,642
It's so crazy.

1518
01:11:07,059 --> 01:11:09,019
No, look, this is gonna
be a great thing.

1519
01:11:09,102 --> 01:11:11,480
It's an amazing platform
for you as a teacher.

1520
01:11:11,563 --> 01:11:12,648
Seriously.

1521
01:11:13,315 --> 01:11:14,983
If you don't do it, I'm not doing it.

1522
01:11:16,860 --> 01:11:17,861
Okay.

1523
01:11:19,863 --> 01:11:22,699
<i>So, this is
your little getaway?</i>

1524
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:25,786
Nope. It's locked.

1525
01:11:34,670 --> 01:11:36,088
Nothing under there?

1526
01:11:36,463 --> 01:11:38,173
Gosh. Dang it.

1527
01:11:39,424 --> 01:11:41,468
-Jeff, can you...
-No, no, that's cheating.

1528
01:11:41,552 --> 01:11:43,804
Come on.
What are you gonna do?

1529
01:11:43,887 --> 01:11:45,305
You got a little problem.

1530
01:11:45,389 --> 01:11:47,933
Sometimes you just got
to concede. It's okay.

1531
01:11:58,652 --> 01:12:01,321
You really like to win.

1532
01:12:01,405 --> 01:12:03,699
Yes! Uh! Ha ha.

1533
01:12:04,908 --> 01:12:06,118
Coming?

1534
01:12:10,247 --> 01:12:12,416
I'm sorry I couldn't find
the wine glasses.

1535
01:12:13,750 --> 01:12:16,086
It's better.

1536
01:12:17,921 --> 01:12:19,256
Living room.

1537
01:12:21,925 --> 01:12:24,178
Oh, this... No. Sound.

1538
01:12:25,345 --> 01:12:26,805
Oh, my God.

1539
01:12:27,973 --> 01:12:30,475
-Jesus!
-Whose house is this?

1540
01:12:31,185 --> 01:12:32,519
Well, that actually could be nice

1541
01:12:32,603 --> 01:12:34,855
to offset the breeze
from the broken window.

1542
01:12:34,938 --> 01:12:36,940
-We can make s'mores.
-I like s'mores.

1543
01:12:37,024 --> 01:12:38,192
-Me, too.
-Yeah.

1544
01:12:38,275 --> 01:12:41,111
<i>What comes after love...</i>

1545
01:12:41,195 --> 01:12:45,199
I am going to
make us these smoothies all by myself.

1546
01:12:45,282 --> 01:12:49,411
<i>I don't think my heart
Was made to break this much</i>

1547
01:12:49,494 --> 01:12:52,956
<i>Tell me there's a
Happy ever after us...</i>

1548
01:12:54,124 --> 01:12:56,084
I think you may
have forgotten this.

1549
01:12:56,168 --> 01:12:58,337
Jesus, he's had an account
for 45 minutes,

1550
01:12:58,420 --> 01:13:00,214
and he already has
half a million followers.

1551
01:13:00,297 --> 01:13:01,340
- Oh, my God. Look.
- Half a million?

1552
01:13:01,423 --> 01:13:02,633
Now you need
your own web page.

1553
01:13:02,716 --> 01:13:05,427
Already created it on Wix.com.

1554
01:13:05,511 --> 01:13:07,054
"Numbers Neva Lie."

1555
01:13:07,137 --> 01:13:08,680
-Oh, that's perfect.
-That is a good one.

1556
01:13:08,764 --> 01:13:11,058
-I love that. Do you love that?
-Yeah, I do like it.

1557
01:13:11,141 --> 01:13:13,268
So, what do you want
your caption to be, Mr. G?

1558
01:13:15,270 --> 01:13:16,980
<i>"If you sit in the question,</i>

1559
01:13:17,147 --> 01:13:19,608
"the answer will find you."

1560
01:13:26,323 --> 01:13:28,784
Sorry, I was checking out
this guy on Instagram.

1561
01:13:28,867 --> 01:13:30,327
Oh, should I be jealous?

1562
01:13:30,410 --> 01:13:33,705
He sounds very
interesting and handsome.

1563
01:13:33,789 --> 01:13:35,624
Just posting about
all this math stuff.

1564
01:13:35,707 --> 01:13:37,084
One of those.

1565
01:13:37,626 --> 01:13:39,127
Brought you an apple.

1566
01:13:46,552 --> 01:13:48,178
Happy birthday, part one.

1567
01:13:50,055 --> 01:13:51,139
Thank you.

1568
01:13:51,223 --> 01:13:52,516
Yeah, on my last birthday,

1569
01:13:52,599 --> 01:13:54,977
I was at a math conference
in the Poconos.

1570
01:13:55,060 --> 01:13:57,855
-Oh! I have a lot to live up to.
-Yes.

1571
01:13:57,938 --> 01:13:59,273
-Open it!
-Okay.

1572
01:14:04,194 --> 01:14:07,614
Like, a handkerchief or...

1573
01:14:08,198 --> 01:14:09,449
Turn around.

1574
01:14:10,158 --> 01:14:11,952
Oh, it's a blindfold.

1575
01:14:14,538 --> 01:14:15,914
I'm a little taken aback.

1576
01:14:15,998 --> 01:14:18,792
I, uh, didn't know
this was your thing,

1577
01:14:18,876 --> 01:14:22,421
-but whatever you're... into.
-Shh.

1578
01:14:23,213 --> 01:14:24,840
- Okay, straight ahead.
- Okay.

1579
01:14:24,923 --> 01:14:26,425
I got to say, I'm getting excited.

1580
01:14:26,508 --> 01:14:27,801
-You should be.
-Okay.

1581
01:14:27,885 --> 01:14:29,052
Wait, turn around.

1582
01:14:29,136 --> 01:14:30,762
It's not a pinata.

1583
01:14:30,846 --> 01:14:32,514
Maybe. Okay.

1584
01:14:32,598 --> 01:14:33,599
That's it, right there.

1585
01:14:33,682 --> 01:14:35,559
-That's where I need you.
-Yeah.

1586
01:14:35,642 --> 01:14:37,352
-You ready?
-Okay.

1587
01:14:48,739 --> 01:14:50,073
Happy birthday.

1588
01:14:50,157 --> 01:14:51,575
No!

1589
01:14:51,658 --> 01:14:52,910
How?

1590
01:14:53,952 --> 01:14:55,746
I know a guy who knows a guy.

1591
01:14:58,207 --> 01:14:59,708
Come on.

1592
01:15:03,212 --> 01:15:05,130
Okay, so
we're on the wishing wheel.

1593
01:15:05,214 --> 01:15:07,549
- Yes.
- Go ahead.

1594
01:15:11,929 --> 01:15:14,389
'Kay, done. Your turn. Make a wish.

1595
01:15:16,225 --> 01:15:17,893
I already got it.

1596
01:15:32,282 --> 01:15:34,243
<i>Since you came around</i>

1597
01:15:34,326 --> 01:15:36,078
<i>You're testing my faith</i>

1598
01:15:36,161 --> 01:15:37,621
<i>I'm praying out loud</i>

1599
01:15:37,704 --> 01:15:38,789
Yeah.

1600
01:15:38,872 --> 01:15:40,874
<i>I feel it in my chest...</i>

1601
01:15:40,958 --> 01:15:43,961
-21!
-Yes!

1602
01:15:44,044 --> 01:15:45,170
-Yeah!
-Hey.

1603
01:15:45,254 --> 01:15:46,463
Come on. Okay. Sorry.

1604
01:15:46,547 --> 01:15:47,923
Great day, you guys.

1605
01:15:48,006 --> 01:15:50,759
We are finished. Grab your stuff.

1606
01:15:51,677 --> 01:15:54,596
-I'm ready.
-You are. You're gonna be great.

1607
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:55,806
- Yo, is that Bastian?
- Amazing.

1608
01:15:55,889 --> 01:15:56,890
- Thanks.
- What's up, kids?

1609
01:15:56,974 --> 01:15:58,100
Oh, my God, Bastian!

1610
01:15:59,226 --> 01:16:00,227
Wait, what's going on?

1611
01:16:00,310 --> 01:16:01,812
He insisted on coming.

1612
01:16:01,895 --> 01:16:04,273
Hey, come on, now.
Your parents are waiting for you outside.

1613
01:16:04,356 --> 01:16:06,567
Okay. See you later, guys. See you. Bye.

1614
01:16:06,650 --> 01:16:07,734
I tried to give you a heads-up,

1615
01:16:07,818 --> 01:16:09,319
but somebody wasn't
answering her phone.

1616
01:16:09,403 --> 01:16:10,612
No, no. There are
no phones at school.

1617
01:16:10,696 --> 01:16:12,656
-What are you guys doing here?
-You got nominated

1618
01:16:12,739 --> 01:16:16,034
for Best Pop Vocal Performance
at the Grammys.

1619
01:16:16,118 --> 01:16:18,996
- What?
<i>- Marry Me...</i>

1620
01:16:19,079 --> 01:16:21,164
-Oh, my God!
-We got nominated!

1621
01:16:21,248 --> 01:16:22,791
- Can you believe it?
- Congratulations.

1622
01:16:22,875 --> 01:16:24,668
-Oh, my God, yes!
-Congratulations.

1623
01:16:24,751 --> 01:16:26,628
Yes. Oh, my God.

1624
01:16:26,712 --> 01:16:27,796
I can't believe this.

1625
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:29,173
It was only a matter of time, babe.

1626
01:16:29,256 --> 01:16:31,091
-Oh, my God.
-You should tell her.

1627
01:16:31,175 --> 01:16:33,135
Oh, yeah.
So, um, Bastian's concert

1628
01:16:33,218 --> 01:16:35,012
at Madison Square Garden
on Friday is streaming

1629
01:16:35,095 --> 01:16:37,806
across multiple platforms,
so there's loads of exposure.

1630
01:16:37,890 --> 01:16:41,226
Yeah, he thought we could surprise
everyone and do <i>Marry Me.</i>

1631
01:16:41,310 --> 01:16:43,270
Right.
Now, the ballots are out next week,

1632
01:16:43,353 --> 01:16:45,981
and nobody's seen you two
together since...

1633
01:16:46,148 --> 01:16:47,524
well, you know, a while.

1634
01:16:48,734 --> 01:16:50,194
Um...

1635
01:16:50,527 --> 01:16:51,695
You know, we don't have any

1636
01:16:51,778 --> 01:16:53,989
-of the dancers in town.
-No, no, no.

1637
01:16:54,072 --> 01:16:55,199
It's short notice. I don't...

1638
01:16:55,282 --> 01:16:57,409
No, but wait.
But we can do the ballad version.

1639
01:16:57,492 --> 01:16:59,912
The one that we wanted
to release after the ceremony.

1640
01:17:04,249 --> 01:17:05,834
I don't know, Sebastian.

1641
01:17:06,084 --> 01:17:07,377
"Sebastian"?

1642
01:17:11,048 --> 01:17:13,008
Come on. "Sebastian"?

1643
01:17:13,091 --> 01:17:14,092
That's his real name.

1644
01:17:14,176 --> 01:17:15,385
Look, can I just...

1645
01:17:15,469 --> 01:17:17,387
I know this is a little...

1646
01:17:17,471 --> 01:17:18,597
I'm not trying to make a thing here,

1647
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:20,974
but this is the song that
you were gonna get married to.

1648
01:17:21,058 --> 01:17:22,768
This is huge for me.

1649
01:17:22,851 --> 01:17:24,937
Totally. Totally.

1650
01:17:25,771 --> 01:17:27,606
You should come. I want you to come.

1651
01:17:27,689 --> 01:17:29,233
Are you gonna come with us?

1652
01:17:31,693 --> 01:17:33,111
Right. Okay. I mean, it's...

1653
01:17:33,195 --> 01:17:34,738
it's not a big deal.

1654
01:17:35,364 --> 01:17:37,074
The nomination is.

1655
01:17:38,283 --> 01:17:40,160
So please don't be upset.

1656
01:17:40,244 --> 01:17:42,496
Uh, I'm just being a jerk.

1657
01:17:42,579 --> 01:17:43,914
And I'm sorry.

1658
01:17:43,997 --> 01:17:46,667
I just want you to remember
award shows are bullshit

1659
01:17:46,750 --> 01:17:49,211
and you don't need them
to tell you how good you are.

1660
01:17:50,379 --> 01:17:51,755
I know.

1661
01:17:52,297 --> 01:17:53,632
Just do me a favor.

1662
01:17:53,715 --> 01:17:56,093
Don't say "Sebastian."

1663
01:17:59,179 --> 01:18:00,556
See you, babe.

1664
01:18:01,932 --> 01:18:03,016
-See you soon.
-Hey.

1665
01:18:03,100 --> 01:18:04,476
We got to schedule
a band rehearsal

1666
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:06,395
-and a wardrobe fitting.
-Okay.

1667
01:18:06,478 --> 01:18:07,813
-Now?
-Yes, now.

1668
01:18:07,896 --> 01:18:09,314
-Yes.
-Okay. You good?

1669
01:18:09,398 --> 01:18:10,899
-I'm good.
-Are you sure?

1670
01:18:10,983 --> 01:18:12,401
Okay, I'll call you.

1671
01:18:12,484 --> 01:18:14,570
This is gonna
be so exciting!

1672
01:18:25,455 --> 01:18:26,582
Hey.

1673
01:18:28,458 --> 01:18:30,210
-You okay?
-Yeah.

1674
01:18:30,294 --> 01:18:32,963
Just keeping Tank company.

1675
01:18:33,046 --> 01:18:34,631
Good dog.

1676
01:18:37,801 --> 01:18:41,388
You're afraid she'll fall
back in love with Bastian and dump you?

1677
01:18:42,222 --> 01:18:43,682
No.

1678
01:18:44,975 --> 01:18:46,310
Yeah.

1679
01:18:46,393 --> 01:18:48,187
I'd be afraid of that, too.

1680
01:18:56,945 --> 01:18:58,363
Thank you. Thank you very much.

1681
01:18:58,447 --> 01:18:59,823
Thank you. Um...

1682
01:19:01,325 --> 01:19:03,744
I have a little surprise for you tonight.

1683
01:19:05,412 --> 01:19:06,705
There is a woman

1684
01:19:07,956 --> 01:19:09,499

1685
01:19:10,334 --> 01:19:12,294
and my biggest inspiration.

1686
01:19:23,805 --> 01:19:25,516
She always gonna be my family.

1687
01:19:27,309 --> 01:19:28,852
And we're always gonna have...

1688
01:19:30,103 --> 01:19:31,396

I know.

1691
01:19:50,666 --> 01:19:52,751
I don't know if I'd say
"bananas," but...

1692
01:19:58,173 --> 01:20:00,717
<i>I've never seen forever</i>

01:21:35,854 --> 01:21:38,440
<i>Marry me, marry me, say yes</i>

1729
01:21:38,524 --> 01:21:41,944
<i>Marry me, marry me
Say yes for the rest</i>

1730
01:21:42,027 --> 01:21:44,655
-<i>The rest of your life
</i>-<i>Marry me, baby</i>

1731
01:21:44,738 --> 01:21:47,241
<i>Marry me, marry me, say yes</i>

1732
01:21:47,324 --> 01:21:50,327

01:21:50,410 --> 01:21:52,913
<i>Marry me, marry me, say yes</i>

01:21:52,996 --> 01:21:55,374
<i>For the rest
The rest of your life</i>

1735
01:21:55,457 --> 01:21:57,584
<i>Baby</i>

1736
01:22:18,856 --> 01:22:22,568
<i>Ma-ma-ma-ma
Ma-ma-ma-ma, ma-marry me</i>

1737
01:22:22,651 --> 01:22:24,611
<i>Won't you marry me, baby?</i>

1738
01:22:24,695 --> 01:22:27,739
<i>Ma-ma-ma-ma
Ma-ma-ma-ma, ma-marry me</i>

1739
01:22:27,823 --> 01:22:30,158
<i>I want you
In my life so bad</i>

1740
01:22:30,242 --> 01:22:34,371
<i>Ma-ma-ma-ma
Ma-ma-ma-ma, ma-marry me</i>

1741
01:22:34,454 --> 01:22:36,290
<i>Won't you love me, baby?</i>

1742
01:22:36,373 --> 01:22:40,502
<i>Ma-ma-ma-ma
Ma-ma-ma-ma, ma-marry me</i>

1743
01:23:04,735 --> 01:23:07,112
Get your ass to the Garden.

1744
01:23:17,247 --> 01:23:18,540
Yes!

1745
01:23:18,624 --> 01:23:20,209
- Yeah. Pose.
- We did it.

1746
01:23:20,292 --> 01:23:21,877
We look so good!

1747
01:23:24,546 --> 01:23:25,756
You guys' chemistry is off the charts.

1748
01:23:25,839 --> 01:23:27,216
Come on, guys. Let's do it.

1749
01:23:27,299 --> 01:23:28,550
And
the audience felt it.

1750
01:23:46,068 --> 01:23:47,277
-You know?
-Yeah.

1751
01:23:47,361 --> 01:23:49,363
-Hey.
-Oh, my God.

1752
01:23:49,446 --> 01:23:51,406
-I didn't know you were coming.
-Hey.

1753
01:23:51,490 --> 01:23:55,118
No, I wasn't, and then I was like,
"I'm gonna get down there," and...

1754
01:23:55,202 --> 01:23:56,495
but I didn't have a pass,

1755
01:23:56,578 --> 01:23:58,163
so I couldn't get in at first,
and then luckily,

1756
01:23:58,247 --> 01:24:00,290
someone saw me
and they brought me backstage

1757
01:24:00,374 --> 01:24:02,334
and then brought me over here.

1758
01:24:03,335 --> 01:24:04,503
So, you didn't see it?

1759
01:24:04,586 --> 01:24:07,130
No, no, I did. I did. Yeah.

1760
01:24:07,256 --> 01:24:09,132
Well... Did you like it?

1761
01:24:09,216 --> 01:24:11,301
I thought it was amazing.

1762
01:24:11,385 --> 01:24:13,262
I was really happy for you.

1763
01:24:13,345 --> 01:24:14,847
I think you're amazing.

1764
01:24:16,098 --> 01:24:18,267
Can you guys...
You know, fine, we'll go over here.

1765
01:24:18,350 --> 01:24:19,601
Yeah.

1766
01:24:26,149 --> 01:24:28,360
It was great. It was...

1767
01:24:28,443 --> 01:24:30,612
Social media is exploding.

1768
01:24:30,696 --> 01:24:33,615
It's, uh... They're even saying
you guys are back together.

1769
01:24:33,699 --> 01:24:35,993
Well, if social media says
it's true, it must be true.

1770
01:24:41,415 --> 01:24:42,457
Wait, are you okay?

1771
01:24:42,541 --> 01:24:44,501
Yeah, no, I'm good.
I'm good. I'm just...

1772
01:24:44,585 --> 01:24:48,672
I'm looking at you here,
and it... It all worked out.

1773
01:24:48,755 --> 01:24:51,341
I mean, no one even
remembers the meltdown.

1774
01:24:51,425 --> 01:24:53,552
I know. It's crazy, right?

1775
01:24:55,387 --> 01:24:57,014
I'm really happy for you.

1776
01:24:57,097 --> 01:24:58,348
You deserve it.

1777
01:24:59,099 --> 01:25:00,475
You really do.

1778
01:25:09,067 --> 01:25:10,569
God, he can sing.

1779
01:25:10,652 --> 01:25:14,198
<i>Dame un segundo
Un segundo chance...</i>

1780
01:25:14,281 --> 01:25:15,532
<i>"Segundo</i> chance."

1781
01:25:15,616 --> 01:25:18,118
What is that? Second chances?

1782
01:25:19,745 --> 01:25:21,121
It's just a song.

1783
01:25:21,205 --> 01:25:22,497
Maybe.

1784
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:25,000
Maybe it's something more.

1785
01:25:28,295 --> 01:25:29,755
What's going on?

1786
01:25:29,838 --> 01:25:31,590
Look, I know this is a big deal,

1787
01:25:31,673 --> 01:25:33,467
and that's why
I wanted to come down here,

1788
01:25:33,550 --> 01:25:35,469
but I don't fit.

1789
01:25:35,552 --> 01:25:38,722
And I think that's
objectively pretty true.

1790
01:25:38,805 --> 01:25:40,891
-And we don't need to--
-So, what are you saying?

1791
01:25:43,143 --> 01:25:45,437
Look, if I'm being honest with myself,

1792
01:25:45,521 --> 01:25:47,189
I really came down here

1793
01:25:47,272 --> 01:25:49,858
just to say that this...
I don't think this works.

1794
01:25:51,818 --> 01:25:54,321
Can I have a bottle
of Hennessy X.O? Yeah?

1795
01:25:55,656 --> 01:25:56,823
Are you breaking up with me?

1796
01:25:56,907 --> 01:25:59,576
Katarina. Kat.

1797
01:25:59,785 --> 01:26:01,411
Kat, come here.

1798
01:26:01,495 --> 01:26:03,455
-Come here.
-It's okay. Go.

1799
01:26:03,539 --> 01:26:04,665
-Go.
-No.

1800
01:26:04,748 --> 01:26:06,375
-Come here.
-What are you saying?

1801
01:26:06,458 --> 01:26:08,085
-Tell me what you... What do you mean?
-Everybody's calling you.

1802
01:26:08,168 --> 01:26:09,419
It's nothing.
Talk later.

1803
01:26:09,503 --> 01:26:11,380
- Go. Go.
- Come here, baby.

1804
01:26:11,463 --> 01:26:12,756
It's fine. Keep going.

1805
01:26:12,840 --> 01:26:15,926
- Come on.
- Kat!

1806
01:26:20,889 --> 01:26:23,725
Guys, raise your glasses

1807
01:26:24,685 --> 01:26:27,646
to the woman who made
all this possible tonight.

1808
01:26:29,189 --> 01:26:30,524
To you.

1809
01:26:30,607 --> 01:26:31,775
To you, Kat.

1810
01:26:32,526 --> 01:26:34,444
-<i>Salud.
</i>-<i>Salud.</i>

1811
01:26:34,903 --> 01:26:35,904
<i>Salud. Salud.</i>

1812
01:26:35,988 --> 01:26:37,614
Yes, cheers!

1813
01:26:39,032 --> 01:26:40,659
It's for you, Kat!

1814
01:27:07,978 --> 01:27:10,063
<i>Always knew you</i>

1815
01:27:10,147 --> 01:27:13,984
<i>Even when
I didn't know you</i>

1816
01:27:14,067 --> 01:27:17,613
<i>Don't make sense
But it do</i>

1817
01:27:18,530 --> 01:27:21,617
<i>I was on my way to you</i>

1818
01:27:23,452 --> 01:27:27,706
<i>Every teardrop
Fell so heavy</i>

1819
01:27:27,789 --> 01:27:33,212
<i>Hurt like hell, but
Heaven sent me through</i>

1820
01:27:34,546 --> 01:27:37,216
<i>I was on my way to you</i>

1821
01:27:42,596 --> 01:27:46,517
{\an8}<i>And every heartbreak
Was a yellow brick road</i>

1822
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:50,270
<i>Pointing me straight
Just taking me home</i>

1823
01:27:50,354 --> 01:27:52,022
<i>I was never lost</i>

1824
01:27:52,105 --> 01:27:55,192
<i>I was just passing through</i>

1825
01:27:56,026 --> 01:28:00,280
{\an8}<i>I was on my way to you</i>

1826
01:28:01,740 --> 01:28:05,452
<i>Hope was hopeless
Faith was running</i>

1827
01:28:05,536 --> 01:28:10,624
{\an8}<i>Didn't notice you were coming through</i>

1828
01:28:11,250 --> 01:28:13,836
<i>You were on your way, too</i>

1829
01:28:16,255 --> 01:28:20,050
<i>And you don't believe
In meant to be</i>

1830
01:28:20,133 --> 01:28:25,931
<i>But somehow you were
Meant for me, it's true</i>

1831
01:28:26,014 --> 01:28:29,685
{\an8}<i>Yeah, you were on your way

1860
01:30:00,567 --> 01:30:02,236
<i>Oh, my darling</i>

1861
01:30:02,319 --> 01:30:04,655
<i>I'm on my way</i>

1862
01:30:19,795 --> 01:30:21,713
Come on, Charlie. Don't be stupid.

1863
01:30:21,797 --> 01:30:23,549
Well, it's a little late for that.

1864
01:30:24,842 --> 01:30:26,677
-You got another one.
-Take it, please.

1865
01:30:26,760 --> 01:30:28,428
It's made out to the school.

1866
01:30:28,512 --> 01:30:30,973
It just feels a little unseemly.

1867
01:30:31,056 --> 01:30:32,808
-I didn't do it for the money.
-I know,

1868
01:30:32,891 --> 01:30:35,477
but if you don't take the check,
then the prenup's not binding.

1869
01:30:35,936 --> 01:30:37,354
You could sell your story.

1870
01:30:37,437 --> 01:30:38,522
You could write a book.

1871
01:30:40,274 --> 01:30:42,025
Is that what you think of me?

1872
01:30:44,486 --> 01:30:46,321
Oh, come on, Charlie.

1873
01:30:46,405 --> 01:30:47,906
I was rooting for you.

1874
01:30:47,990 --> 01:30:50,200
I wanted it to work.
The whole world wanted it to.

1875
01:30:50,284 --> 01:30:53,537
I'm sorry to disappoint
you and the world.

1876
01:30:53,620 --> 01:30:55,038
You're disappointing yourself.

1877
01:30:55,122 --> 01:30:57,165
I'm protecting myself.

1878
01:30:58,125 --> 01:30:59,209
I can't get away from her.

1879
01:30:59,293 --> 01:31:03,005
There's always a poster,
a Vitamix or a billboard.

1880
01:31:03,088 --> 01:31:05,507
You know they're not together?

1881
01:31:09,428 --> 01:31:10,637
Maybe not.

1882
01:31:12,097 --> 01:31:13,557
But, Colin, can you do me a favor?

1883
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:16,226
Will you be there for her
when she figures it all out?

1884
01:31:16,518 --> 01:31:18,061
She's gonna need someone.

1885
01:31:27,029 --> 01:31:30,574
<i> On Friday's show, we'll be
talking to the beautiful Kat Valdez</i>

1886
01:31:30,657 --> 01:31:32,743
<i>about her new hit single

01:31:43,337 --> 01:31:46,507
<i>headbutting or tail slapping.</i>

1891
01:31:46,590 --> 01:31:50,093
<i>Physical dominance
establishes the leader.</i>

1892
01:31:50,177 --> 01:31:54,056
<i>Pods can travel in herds
of up to hundreds of dolphins</i>

1893
01:31:54,139 --> 01:31:56,475
<i>and can cover 80 miles.</i>

1894
01:32:12,199 --> 01:32:14,785
Mathalon, baby,
with the Mathalonians.

1895
01:32:14,868 --> 01:32:16,912
{\an8}-Headed to Peoria, Illinois.
-Hey.

1896
01:32:16,995 --> 01:32:18,205
{\an8}Coming to get ya.

1897
01:32:18,288 --> 01:32:20,249
{\an8}-Wait, what are you doing?
-We're live.

1898
01:32:20,332 --> 01:32:23,794
{\an8}Say something smart
or witty or, uh, numeric.

1899
01:32:23,877 --> 01:32:25,879
{\an8}5,000 people are watching.

1900
01:32:25,963 --> 01:32:27,297
{\an8}Bye.

1901
01:32:27,381 --> 01:32:29,258
{\an8}-Charles.
-I'm serious.

1902
01:32:29,341 --> 01:32:31,009
I can't. Turn it off.

1903
01:32:31,093 --> 01:32:33,053
Are you at some point
gonna be fun again?

1904
01:32:33,136 --> 01:32:34,304
I was never fun.

1905
01:32:34,388 --> 01:32:36,682
That's true, and I love you anyway.

1906
01:32:36,765 --> 01:32:39,059
You know,
you're not always gonna feel this way.

1907
01:32:39,142 --> 01:32:41,353
You're lucky you made it.
We were gonna leave without you.

1908
01:32:41,436 --> 01:32:42,729
Parker. No, we weren't.

1909
01:32:42,813 --> 01:32:45,148
-Come on, let's go, Percy.
-We absolutely were.

1910
01:32:46,441 --> 01:32:48,819
<i>I loved
you and Charlie as a couple.</i>

1911
01:32:49,486 --> 01:32:50,904
Are you still friends?

1912
01:32:51,947 --> 01:32:54,116
Is it okay if I ask you that?

1913
01:32:55,242 --> 01:32:56,326
Yeah.

1914
01:32:56,410 --> 01:32:57,619
Um, sure.

1915
01:32:58,704 --> 01:33:00,122
Yeah.

1916
01:33:00,205 --> 01:33:01,874
He seems like the sweetest man.

1917
01:33:02,583 --> 01:33:03,792
You know, I actually DMed him

1918
01:33:03,876 --> 01:33:06,378
to wish him luck
on his Mathalon tomorrow.

1919
01:33:06,461 --> 01:33:09,882
He never answered, obviously.

1920
01:33:12,009 --> 01:33:13,760
Mathalon's tomorrow?

1921
01:33:14,052 --> 01:33:15,053
Yeah.

1922
01:33:16,263 --> 01:33:17,598
- Hey.
- Hey.

1923
01:33:18,432 --> 01:33:19,933
I'll just fix that.

1924
01:33:20,017 --> 01:33:21,351
Thank you.

1925
01:33:22,519 --> 01:33:25,480
-Oh, I like that.
-Oh, thank you.

1926
01:33:25,564 --> 01:33:27,649
Nice.

1927
01:33:27,733 --> 01:33:28,859
<i>So, we've been... we've been</i>

1928
01:33:28,942 --> 01:33:30,444
beating around the bush,
and I think that

1929
01:33:30,527 --> 01:33:32,446
we should get right down to it.

1930
01:33:32,529 --> 01:33:35,115
I mean, we all know
that you guys are not "together,"

1931
01:33:35,199 --> 01:33:38,785
uh, yet you wrote
<i>Marry Me </i>for each other.

1932
01:33:38,911 --> 01:33:41,205
Uh, Bastian wrote <i>Segundo</i> for Kat.

1933
01:33:41,288 --> 01:33:43,874
Kat wrote <i>On My Way </i>for Bastian.

1934
01:33:43,957 --> 01:33:46,919
I'd say the next song
should probably be, uh,

1935
01:33:47,002 --> 01:33:48,921
<i>Come On Already! </i>Am I right?

1936
01:33:50,380 --> 01:33:51,798
Let's see if we can
get these two guys

1937
01:33:51,882 --> 01:33:54,885
to sing a little romantic duet
when we come back. Ooh.

1938
01:33:55,010 --> 01:33:56,887
Do not change that channel.

1939
01:34:07,981 --> 01:34:10,025
I didn't write
<i>On My Way </i>for Bastian.

1940
01:34:16,198 --> 01:34:17,199
I'm sorry, Jimmy.

1941
01:34:17,282 --> 01:34:20,244
I know it's an inopportune time
to have an epiphany, but...

1942
01:34:21,787 --> 01:34:23,288
I don't want to go back.

1943
01:34:27,042 --> 01:34:30,254
Someone told me that if you sit
in the question long enough,

1944
01:34:31,213 --> 01:34:32,965
the answer finds you.

1945
01:34:34,466 --> 01:34:35,926
And the answer is...

1946
01:34:38,136 --> 01:34:40,931
I don't want to keep making the same
mistakes over and over.

1947
01:34:43,725 --> 01:34:45,561
I want something different.

1948
01:34:52,484 --> 01:34:55,028
Come here.

1949
01:34:59,908 --> 01:35:02,286
So, I'm guessing
no romantic duet.

1950
01:35:05,122 --> 01:35:06,331
- Hey.
- Kat!

1951
01:35:06,415 --> 01:35:07,875
-That's Kat Valdez.
-Kat! Kat, wait!

1952
01:35:07,958 --> 01:35:08,959
Where you going?

1953
01:35:09,042 --> 01:35:10,627
Kat, hey! How about a shot, huh?

1954
01:35:10,711 --> 01:35:12,129
Peoria.

1955
01:35:12,212 --> 01:35:13,672
-I'll get you a plane.
-No.

1956
01:35:13,755 --> 01:35:16,091
I want to do this by myself, okay?

1957
01:35:16,175 --> 01:35:17,718
- Can't be that hard.
- Kat, come on.

1958
01:35:17,801 --> 01:35:19,386
- Kat, where you headed?
- How about another shot?

1959
01:35:19,469 --> 01:35:21,054
Take me to the airport.

1960
01:35:21,471 --> 01:35:22,639
Bye!

1961
01:35:23,307 --> 01:35:25,726
- Hey.
- That's not our car.

1962
01:35:29,938 --> 01:35:31,315
Whoa. Is that Kat Valdez?

1963
01:35:31,398 --> 01:35:33,150
Oh, my God.
Kat Valdez?

1964
01:35:33,233 --> 01:35:35,027
You're right.
What's she doing here?

1965
01:35:37,237 --> 01:35:39,239
Sorry. The last
connecting flight to Peoria

1966
01:35:39,323 --> 01:35:41,491
is through Chicago,
but it's all sold out.

1967
01:35:41,575 --> 01:35:43,410
If you fly tomorrow...

1968
01:35:43,493 --> 01:35:45,454
Tonight. It has to be tonight.

1969
01:35:45,537 --> 01:35:47,497
The Mathalon will be over
by noon tomorrow,

1970
01:35:47,581 --> 01:35:49,458
and I promised I'd be there.

1971
01:35:52,628 --> 01:35:56,632
I will give anyone
$5,000 for their standby slot to Chicago.

1972
01:35:56,715 --> 01:36:00,844
It's illegal.
You can't buy someone else's ticket.

1973
01:36:00,928 --> 01:36:02,888
-You can't?
-Kat.

1974
01:36:02,971 --> 01:36:05,224
Did you know
it's illegal to buy someone else's ticket?

1975
01:36:05,307 --> 01:36:07,184
Uh, yeah. Everyone does.

1976
01:36:07,267 --> 01:36:09,019
Now, I can't get you a plane,

1977
01:36:09,102 --> 01:36:10,938
but we got you the last
available ticket.

1978
01:36:11,021 --> 01:36:12,189
It's in coach.

1979
01:36:12,272 --> 01:36:13,899
-You're a lifesaver.
-Yeah.

1980
01:36:13,982 --> 01:36:15,817
Tell me that after
you get there, okay?

1981
01:36:15,901 --> 01:36:18,612
So, there's your passport
and some money.

1982
01:36:19,446 --> 01:36:20,989
Go find your answer.

1983
01:36:24,201 --> 01:36:26,078
-Okay.
-Go on.

1984
01:36:26,995 --> 01:36:27,996
Bye.

1985
01:36:29,998 --> 01:36:32,334
<i> Ladies and gentlemen,
due to freezing weather conditions</i>

1986
01:36:32,417 --> 01:36:33,669
<i>and some strong headwinds,</i>

1987
01:36:33,752 --> 01:36:35,838
<i>we will be in flight
a little longer than usual,</i>

1988
01:36:35,921 --> 01:36:37,965
<i>but we will get you there
by morning.</i>

1989
01:36:38,048 --> 01:36:39,299
Excuse me, miss.

1990
01:36:39,383 --> 01:36:41,677
I'd like to buy
champagne and caviar for the whole flight.

1991
01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:44,388
I'm sorry. We only have ham wraps,
cheese cubes

1992
01:36:44,471 --> 01:36:45,806
and Michelob ULTRA.

1993
01:36:45,889 --> 01:36:49,476
Okay, well, then ham wraps
and Michelob ULTRA.

1994
01:36:50,394 --> 01:36:52,396
What about
the cheese cubes?

1995
01:36:52,479 --> 01:36:54,565
Sure. Cheese cubes, too.
Why not?

1996
01:36:54,690 --> 01:36:59,194
Um, also, who wants to sell me
a very heavy winter coat?

1997
01:37:01,530 --> 01:37:04,741
Uh, the answer is nine?

1998
01:37:05,158 --> 01:37:07,119
That answer is correct.

1999
01:37:07,202 --> 01:37:09,121
This round goes
to the Coolidge Pi-thons.

2000
01:37:09,204 --> 01:37:11,623
Nice, Esther. Good job.

2001
01:37:11,707 --> 01:37:13,500
Go, Esther!

2002
01:37:18,088 --> 01:37:20,465
Where are the people
with the cars?

2003
01:37:20,549 --> 01:37:21,842
Excuse me, sir.
Do you have a phone charger?

2004
01:37:21,925 --> 01:37:23,010
-I-I need...
-No. Sorry.

2005
01:37:23,093 --> 01:37:24,678
- I do.
- You...

2006
01:37:24,761 --> 01:37:26,471
Colin called me, so...

2007
01:37:26,555 --> 01:37:28,515
Is Charlie here?

2008
01:37:28,599 --> 01:37:30,559
You know, I didn't
tell him I was coming.

2009
01:37:30,642 --> 01:37:33,061
I didn't want to screw
with him on the big day, in case...

2010
01:37:34,396 --> 01:37:37,107
You know, he's not good
with the back-and-forth,

2011
01:37:37,191 --> 01:37:39,735
so I got to ask you, Kat, are you...

2012
01:37:42,738 --> 01:37:44,198
Is this for real?

2013
01:37:46,575 --> 01:37:50,162
Well, I walked out on Fallon to freeze
my toes off in Peoria, so...

2014
01:37:53,081 --> 01:37:54,791
Excellent point.

2015
01:37:54,875 --> 01:37:56,460
I called an Uber.

2016
01:37:57,336 --> 01:37:59,588
-Forty-seven minutes?
-What?

2017
01:38:00,047 --> 01:38:01,298
We're not gonna make it.

2018
01:38:01,381 --> 01:38:02,633
Didn't they already start?

2019
01:38:02,716 --> 01:38:05,469
Should we hitch a ride?
I don't know what...

2020
01:38:05,969 --> 01:38:07,137
Wait!

2021
01:38:11,642 --> 01:38:15,646
This woman,
this superstar, this icon,

2022
01:38:15,729 --> 01:38:18,315
has flown in coach in stilettos

2023
01:38:18,398 --> 01:38:21,068
to win back the unlikely
love of her life,

2024
01:38:21,151 --> 01:38:24,321
who, against all odds, she loves.

2025
01:38:24,404 --> 01:38:25,697
And he loves her.

2026
01:38:25,781 --> 01:38:27,074
He does, right?

2027
01:38:27,157 --> 01:38:28,534
Completely.

2028
01:38:29,409 --> 01:38:32,746
The next thing you say
will forecast not just their future,

2029
01:38:33,247 --> 01:38:35,457
but the future
of-of anyone whoever believed

2030
01:38:35,541 --> 01:38:37,334
in the magic of a leap of faith.

2031
01:38:37,793 --> 01:38:40,170
-Look...
-She'll give you a thousand dollars.

2032
01:38:40,254 --> 01:38:42,506
The answer is 15.

2033
01:38:42,589 --> 01:38:43,966
The answer is correct.

2034
01:38:44,049 --> 01:38:45,801
-Five points, Trinity Numerators.
-Yes!

2035
01:38:45,884 --> 01:38:47,719
Yes! Get 'em!

2036
01:38:48,929 --> 01:38:50,097
Congratulations.

2037
01:38:50,430 --> 01:38:53,100
After a break, we're moving
to a sudden-death round

2038
01:38:53,183 --> 01:38:54,685
between
the three-time champions,

2039
01:38:54,768 --> 01:38:56,728
- Trinity Numerators...
- Yes!

2040
01:38:56,812 --> 01:38:59,481
...and the first-time finalists,
Coolidge Pi-thons.

2041
01:39:01,859 --> 01:39:04,361
-Sudden death.
-Ooh, blast off.

2042
01:39:04,444 --> 01:39:08,240
First up, Lou Gilbert
for the Coolidge Pi-thons.

2043
01:39:08,323 --> 01:39:09,741
Choker better pray.

2044
01:39:09,825 --> 01:39:11,535
Shut up.

2045
01:39:13,829 --> 01:39:15,122
You laughing at that?

2046
01:39:15,914 --> 01:39:17,040
Look...

2047
01:39:17,541 --> 01:39:19,084
I don't want to embarrass you.

2048
01:39:19,168 --> 01:39:20,752
I know that's your daughter.

2049
01:39:20,836 --> 01:39:22,546
- Yeah?
- I saw her last year.

2050
01:39:23,380 --> 01:39:24,923
She's got stage fright.

2051
01:39:25,007 --> 01:39:26,091
My daughter's fine.

2052
01:39:26,175 --> 01:39:29,094
Look, I just think maybe
it would be easier on you

2053
01:39:29,178 --> 01:39:31,513
if you guys just conceded the title.

2054
01:39:31,597 --> 01:39:33,223
-Concede?
-Mm-hmm.

2055
01:39:33,307 --> 01:39:34,808
-Give you the trophy?
-No.

2056
01:39:34,892 --> 01:39:37,895
It's more like you save
yourself from humiliation.

2057
01:39:38,270 --> 01:39:39,271
Huh?

2058
01:39:40,731 --> 01:39:42,774
Okay, huddle up. Here we go.

2059
01:39:43,692 --> 01:39:47,070
So, uh, Coach Looney Tunes
over there wants to know

2060
01:39:47,154 --> 01:39:49,323
if we just want to concede
and give him the trophy.

2061
01:39:49,406 --> 01:39:51,283
- No!
- That doesn't even make sense.

2062
01:39:51,366 --> 01:39:52,993
- Yeah.
- Four in a row, baby.

2063
01:39:53,076 --> 01:39:56,538
How about we go
show him what the Pi-thons are all about?

2064
01:39:56,622 --> 01:39:58,081
Yeah!

2065
01:40:00,042 --> 01:40:01,502
Lou, you ready for this?

2066
01:40:03,253 --> 01:40:04,588
Watch me.

2067
01:40:10,802 --> 01:40:12,179
This next answer will determine

2068
01:40:12,262 --> 01:40:15,098
whether the Coolidge Pi-thons
win the Mathalon.

2069
01:40:15,933 --> 01:40:17,476
Lou Gilbert.

2070
01:40:17,559 --> 01:40:19,061
-Yes, Lou.
-Go, Lou!

2071
01:40:23,690 --> 01:40:25,943
-Come on, Lou.
-You got this.

2072
01:40:27,319 --> 01:40:30,072
- Come on, Lou. You got this.
- Come on, Lou.

2073
01:40:30,906 --> 01:40:33,992
A circle with perimeter eight pi
is inscribed in an ellipse

2074
01:40:34,076 --> 01:40:35,869
whose width is twice its height.

2075
01:40:35,953 --> 01:40:38,789
What is the area
of the ellipse in square units?

2076
01:40:39,957 --> 01:40:41,875
Okay. All right, all right.

2077
01:40:41,959 --> 01:40:44,878
You know this. Set your mind to it.

2078
01:40:45,963 --> 01:40:47,214
She's got it.

2079
01:40:47,297 --> 01:40:48,340
Yeah, she...

2080
01:40:49,508 --> 01:40:51,426
Anyone know a good choke?

2081
01:40:51,510 --> 01:40:52,636
- Hey.
- Quiet, please.

2082
01:40:52,719 --> 01:40:54,221
Please respect the Mathalonians.

2083
01:40:57,432 --> 01:40:58,559
It's not fair.

2084
01:40:59,059 --> 01:41:00,269
Loser!

2085
01:41:08,485 --> 01:41:10,320
I tried to protect you from this.

2086
01:41:10,404 --> 01:41:11,738
Stop it.

2087
01:41:13,574 --> 01:41:15,117
Stay with us, Lou.

2088
01:41:17,995 --> 01:41:20,455
Don't let it get in your head!

2089
01:41:20,998 --> 01:41:22,416
Lou.

2090
01:41:29,548 --> 01:41:30,966
What the hell is this?

2091
01:41:31,258 --> 01:41:34,011
Oh, my God.

2092
01:41:44,146 --> 01:41:45,189
You guys, it's over here!

2093
01:41:47,316 --> 01:41:48,400
Dork!

2094
01:41:48,483 --> 01:41:50,068
Yeah, Mr. Gilbert. Good idea.

2095
01:41:50,152 --> 01:41:51,528
Yeah, that's it, Mr. Gilbert.

2096
01:41:51,612 --> 01:41:53,113
Yeah.

2097
01:41:53,322 --> 01:41:54,698
You got it.

2098
01:41:57,034 --> 01:41:58,202
Come on!

2099
01:42:06,126 --> 01:42:08,212
Come on. Objection. He's counting.

2100
01:42:08,295 --> 01:42:09,963
He's dancing, you lunatic.

2101
01:42:11,340 --> 01:42:12,591
That's Kat Valdez.

2102
01:42:12,674 --> 01:42:14,635
Oh, my gosh. I'm gonna die.

2103
01:42:15,677 --> 01:42:17,346
Come on. Come on.

2104
01:42:23,352 --> 01:42:24,686
I believe in you!

2105
01:42:28,774 --> 01:42:30,067
32 pi!

2106
01:42:32,194 --> 01:42:34,112
- The answer is correct.
- Yes!

2107
01:42:34,196 --> 01:42:35,781
But the timer's elapsed.

2108
01:42:35,864 --> 01:42:37,741
The Trinity Numerators retain
their national status.

2109
01:42:37,824 --> 01:42:41,828
We'll reconvene in ten minutes
for the awards presentation.

2110
01:42:42,788 --> 01:42:44,289
Hey, it's okay, Lou.

2111
01:42:44,373 --> 01:42:46,708
Four years in a row! Four years in a row!

2112
01:42:48,210 --> 01:42:49,336
Hey. Hey!

2113
01:42:49,419 --> 01:42:51,296
I'm so proud of you.

2114
01:42:51,380 --> 01:42:54,174
-Dad, I lost again.
-No, it doesn't matter.

2115
01:42:54,258 --> 01:42:56,844
First of all, you got it right.
It was perfect.

2116
01:42:56,927 --> 01:42:59,346
But second of all,
you were just up there.

2117
01:42:59,429 --> 01:43:01,932
You stood up there,
and you were so brave.

2118
01:43:02,933 --> 01:43:05,727
I'm the one who should be crying
for the dancing I was doing.

2119
01:43:05,811 --> 01:43:08,397
You were great.

2120
01:43:09,731 --> 01:43:10,899
Thank you.

2121
01:43:13,360 --> 01:43:14,987
I love you, Dad.

2122
01:43:15,821 --> 01:43:17,614
You were amazing, Lou.

2123
01:43:18,407 --> 01:43:19,908
Really, I mean,

2124
01:43:19,992 --> 01:43:21,785
you took a shot
even though it was scary.

2125
01:43:23,412 --> 01:43:24,705
That's what matters.

2126
01:43:28,333 --> 01:43:31,044
Not everything adds up
the way you think it will.

2127
01:43:34,840 --> 01:43:37,759
You know, they say
if you want something different,

2128
01:43:37,843 --> 01:43:39,887
you have to do something different.

2129
01:43:42,055 --> 01:43:43,599
What if we're just too different?

2130
01:43:43,682 --> 01:43:45,601
What if we're not?

2131
01:44:24,389 --> 01:44:26,808
{\an8}I'm fully blacking out right now.

2132
01:44:27,267 --> 01:44:29,937
- Come on, Mr. G.
- Come on, Mr. G!

2133
01:44:30,020 --> 01:44:31,897
You're leaving her hanging.

2134
01:44:31,980 --> 01:44:33,023
Come on, dude.

2135
01:44:33,106 --> 01:44:34,441
Dad.

2136
01:44:39,488 --> 01:44:41,573
Aww.

2137
01:44:48,664 --> 01:44:51,041
Ew.

2138
01:44:54,920 --> 01:44:56,296
Here we go.

2139
01:44:58,632 --> 01:45:00,884
<i>Marry me, marry me say yes</i>

2140
01:45:00,968 --> 01:45:03,387
<i>Marry me, marry me, say yes</i>

2141
01:45:03,470 --> 01:45:05,430
<i>Marry me, marry me, say yes</i>

2142
01:45:05,514 --> 01:45:06,807
<i>For the rest, the rest...</i>

2143
01:45:06,890 --> 01:45:09,101
<i>I never seen forever
Oh, yeah</i>

2144
01:45:09,184 --> 01:45:11,770
<i>I never seen forever
In the wild</i>

2145
01:45:11,854 --> 01:45:16,233
<i>But now I'm lookin'
Now I'm lookin' in its eyes</i>

2146
01:45:16,733 --> 01:45:18,735
<i>Baby, you're my shelter</i>

2147
01:45:18,819 --> 01:45:21,405
{\an8}<i>Shelter from
A broken paradise</i>

2148
01:45:21,488 --> 01:45:22,698
{\an8}<i>I couldn't dream it</i>

2149
01:45:22,781 --> 01:45:25,826
{\an8}<i>Any better if I tried</i>

2150
01:45:26,910 --> 01:45:28,745
<i>True love gotta
Ring, ring, ring</i>

2151
01:45:28,829 --> 01:45:29,872
-<i>Ring, ring
</i>-<i>Church bells</i>

2152
01:45:29,955 --> 01:45:31,874
-<i>Let 'em ring, ring, ring
</i>-<i>Ring, ring</i>

2153
01:45:31,957 --> 01:45:33,709
{\an8}<i>Angels gonna
Sing, sing, sing</i>

2154
01:45:33,792 --> 01:45:35,669
{\an8}<i>Tonight, tonight, tonight</i>

2155
01:45:35,752 --> 01:45:36,795
{\an8}<i>Baby</i>

2156
01:45:36,879 --> 01:45:39,131
{\an8}<i>Marry me, marry me, say yes</i>

2157
01:45:39,214 --> 01:45:41,508
{\an8}<i>Marry me, marry me, say yes</i>

2158
01:45:41,592 --> 01:45:43,677
{\an8}<i>Marry me, marry me, say yes</i>

2159
01:45:43,760 --> 01:45:45,929
{\an8}<i>For the rest, the rest
Of your life</i>

2160
01:45:46,013 --> 01:45:49,099
{\an8}<i>Ma-ma-ma, ma-ma-ma
Ma-ma-ma-marry me</i>

2161
01:45:49,183 --> 01:45:50,726
<i>Won't you love me, baby?</i>

2162
01:45:50,809 --> 01:45:53,478
<i>Ma-ma-ma, ma-ma-ma,
Ma-ma-ma-marry me...</i>

2163
01:45:53,562 --> 01:45:55,480
-Getting ready.
-Tanky.

2164
01:45:55,564 --> 01:45:57,691
-This is the calm...
-Ah!

2165
01:45:57,774 --> 01:45:58,817
Tank!

2166
01:45:59,818 --> 01:46:01,987
-Okay, wait. Slower.
-He doesn't have teeth.

2167
01:46:02,070 --> 01:46:03,572
-Slower. Okay.
-He doesn't...

2168
01:46:03,655 --> 01:46:06,700
{\an8}<i>Diamonds and a necklace
everything else is off</i>

2169
01:46:06,783 --> 01:46:08,285
{\an8}Good boy.

2170
01:46:08,368 --> 01:46:10,370
{\an8}<i>Now he wanna bet
He can beat me to the bed...</i>

2171
01:46:10,454 --> 01:46:12,831
So, we met
at Jimmy Fallon, didn't we?

2172
01:46:12,915 --> 01:46:14,374
-Yeah.
-We didn't hook up at Fallon.

2173
01:46:14,458 --> 01:46:16,043
No, we had sex at Burning Man.

2174
01:46:16,126 --> 01:46:17,669
So, Kat made me come
to one of those, um...

2175
01:46:17,753 --> 01:46:18,795
What are they called again, babe?

2176
01:46:18,879 --> 01:46:20,005
-It's called a Mathalon, bro.
-Yes!

2177
01:46:20,088 --> 01:46:21,089
Oh, my God, it's so boring.

2178
01:46:21,173 --> 01:46:22,216
And what do you guys
do there again?

2179
01:46:22,299 --> 01:46:23,634
-It's this thing called, um...
-Math.

2180
01:46:23,717 --> 01:46:25,260
-Yes! Oh, my God.
-Mm-hm. Yep.

2181
01:46:25,344 --> 01:46:26,803
{\an8}I fell asleep just even
thinking about it, but...

2182
01:46:26,887 --> 01:46:27,930
{\an8}She did.

2183
01:46:28,013 --> 01:46:30,766
{\an8}I met my most favorite person here.

2184
01:46:30,849 --> 01:46:32,643
We met at a party
as she was leaving.

2185
01:46:32,726 --> 01:46:35,270
And had I walked out ten seconds earlier,
we never would've met.

2186
01:46:35,354 --> 01:46:37,189
And I bet you wish
that was the case sometimes.

2187
01:46:37,272 --> 01:46:39,107
Never.

2188
01:46:39,650 --> 01:46:41,401
I had a six-mile radius set,

2189
01:46:41,485 --> 01:46:43,946
and she definitely
lived more than six miles away.

2190
01:46:44,029 --> 01:46:46,198
Well, she wanted
to meet at 4:00 p.m.

2191
01:46:46,281 --> 01:46:47,908
Who meets at 4:00 p.m.?

2192
01:46:47,991 --> 01:46:50,869
When we met, he was in a unitard.

2193
01:46:51,578 --> 01:46:53,205
She liked what she saw.

2194
01:46:54,498 --> 01:46:57,751
Eighty-one years ago,
we were born in the same hospital

2195
01:46:57,835 --> 01:47:00,754
two days apart, in diapers.

2196
01:47:00,838 --> 01:47:03,173
Here it is 81 years later,

2197
01:47:03,257 --> 01:47:05,133
and we're back in diapers again.

2198
01:47:05,217 --> 01:47:07,302
Oh, Charlie!

2199
01:47:07,427 --> 01:47:09,429
We met on a dating app, but then,

2200
01:47:09,513 --> 01:47:11,431
uh, he invited me on the second date,

2201
01:47:11,515 --> 01:47:13,767
um, camping in the woods,
and I was like,

2202
01:47:13,851 --> 01:47:15,894
"That seems unsafe...

2203
01:47:15,978 --> 01:47:17,271
-"so I'll go."
-Her friend told her not to go.

2204
01:47:17,354 --> 01:47:19,857
Yeah, but she did,
and it's been five years,

2205
01:47:19,940 --> 01:47:22,401
and she's still alive.

2206
01:47:23,193 --> 01:47:24,236
We met at a concert.

2207
01:47:24,319 --> 01:47:25,821
<i>Spotlight on you got me zoomin'</i>

2208
01:47:25,904 --> 01:47:28,657
<i>I'm falling into you</i>

2209
01:47:28,740 --> 01:47:31,326
<i>We're dancing on tabletops</i>

2210
01:47:31,410 --> 01:47:33,829
<i>Neighbors calling the cops</i>

2211
01:47:33,912 --> 01:47:36,123
<i>When I'm with you
Feels like</i>

2212
01:47:36,206 --> 01:47:38,250
<i>Nobody's watching us</i>

2213
01:47:38,333 --> 01:47:40,878
<i>We're burning down
All the clocks</i>

2214
01:47:40,961 --> 01:47:43,338
<i>Hoping that time will stop</i>

2215
01:47:43,422 --> 01:47:45,465
<i>Block out
The world tonight</i>

2216
01:47:45,549 --> 01:47:48,135
<i>Like nobody's watching us</i>

2217
01:47:48,218 --> 01:47:49,803
<i>Nobody's watching us</i>

2218
01:47:49,887 --> 01:47:52,222
<i>No, nobody's watching</i>

2219
01:47:52,306 --> 01:47:54,558
<i>So come touch my body</i>

2220
01:47:54,641 --> 01:47:57,227
<i>No, nobody's watching us</i>

2221
01:47:57,311 --> 01:47:59,438
<i>Nobody's watching us</i>

2222
01:47:59,521 --> 01:48:01,773
<i>No, nobody's watching</i>

2223
01:48:01,857 --> 01:48:04,151
<i>So come touch my body</i>

2224
01:48:04,234 --> 01:48:06,737
<i>No, nobody's watching us</i>

2225
01:48:06,820 --> 01:48:08,822
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh</i>

2226
01:48:08,906 --> 01:48:11,325
<i>Right here by the light
Of the moon</i>

2227
01:48:11,408 --> 01:48:14,077
<i>Spotlight on you
Got me zoomin'</i>

2228
01:48:14,161 --> 01:48:16,663
<i>I'm falling into you</i>

2229
01:48:16,747 --> 01:48:19,374
<i>We're dancing on tabletops</i>

01:48:19,458 --> 01:48:21,793
<i>Neighbors calling the cops</i>

2231
01:48:21,877 --> 01:48:24,171
<i>When I'm with you
Feels like</i>

2232
01:48:24,254 --> 01:48:26,256
<i>Nobody's watching us</i>

2233
01:48:26,340 --> 01:48:29,009
<i>We're burning down
All the clocks</i>

2234
01:48:29,092 --> 01:48:31,386
<i>Hoping that time will stop</i>

2235
01:48:31,470 --> 01:48:33,514
<i>Block out
The world tonight</i>

2236
01:48:33,597 --> 01:48:36,183
<i>Like nobody's watching us</i>

2237
01:48:36,266 --> 01:48:37,976
<i>Nobody's watching us</i>

2238
01:48:38,060 --> 01:48:40,187
<i>No, nobody's watching</i>

2239
01:48:40,270 --> 01:48:42,689
<i>So come touch my body</i>

2240
01:48:42,773 --> 01:48:44,525
<i>No, nobody's watching us</i>

2241
01:48:44,608 --> 01:48:47,653
-<i>No, no, no, no, no
</i>-<i>No-no-no, no-no</i>

2242
01:48:47,736 --> 01:48:49,863
<i>No, nobody's watching</i>

2243
01:48:49,947 --> 01:48:52,199
<i>So come touch my body</i>

2244
01:48:52,282 --> 01:48:55,160
<i>No, nobody's watching us</i>

2245
01:48:55,244 --> 01:48:56,662
<i>Na, na, na</i>

2246
01:48:58,121 --> 01:49:00,999
<i>Got ocean views from ceiling to the floor</i>

2247
01:49:01,083 --> 01:49:04,962
<i>Keep a milli by the bed
A hundred more offshore</i>

2248
01:49:05,045 --> 01:49:07,840
<i>Closets full of Louis
And Christian Dior</i>

2249
01:49:07,923 --> 01:49:11,343
<i>Picassos and van Goghs
That no one's seen before</i>

2250
01:49:11,426 --> 01:49:15,180
<i>Diamonds drippin' down
Like fountains</i>

2251
01:49:15,264 --> 01:49:17,933
<i>I'll sign, don't care
What the amount is</i>

2252
01:49:18,016 --> 01:49:19,393
<i>Every day and night</i>

2253
01:49:19,476 --> 01:49:21,478
<i>Live a life filled with luxury</i>

2254
01:49:21,562 --> 01:49:23,939
<i>Don't matter when
You're not with me</i>

2255
01:49:24,022 --> 01:49:25,065
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

2257
01:49:51,592 --> 01:49:53,051
<i>Is this sentimental</i>

2258
01:49:53,135 --> 01:49:55,012
<i>To put all my money just
Right where my heart is?</i>

2259
01:49:55,095 --> 01:49:56,346
<i>But, baby, you're special</i>

2260
01:49:56,430 --> 01:49:58,348
<i>No matter the cost
I'm-a do it regardless</i>

2261
01:49:58,432 --> 01:50:01,476
<i>Let's take a jet
We're riding out to Puerto Rico</i>

2262
01:50:01,560 --> 01:50:04,855
<i>Later we get the yacht
Head to Santo Domingo</i>

2263
01:50:04,938 --> 01:50:08,275
<i>And my body, papi
Es tu party</i>

2264
01:50:08,358 --> 01:50:11,612
<i>Now I'm flying
You be the pilot</i>

2265
01:50:11,695 --> 01:50:15,199
<i>No questioning
Our love, make my Best days even better</i>

2266
01:50:15,282 --> 01:50:18,202
<i>Long ain't long enough
I'm looking at forever</i>

2267
01:50:18,285 --> 01:50:21,580
<i>Diamonds drippin' down
Like fountains</i>
