1
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:03,915
- Mr. Szpilman?
- Hello.

2
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,543
I came specially to meet you.
I love your playing.

3
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:10,630
- Who are you?
- My name's Dorota, Jurek's sister.

4
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:13,341
- You're bleeding!
- It's nothing.

5
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:17,512
You can write him a fan letter later.
This isn't the best time. Come on.

6
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:20,306
Jurek, where have you been
hiding her?

7
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:27,272
- I don't know what to take.
- You always take too much.

8
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,609
How many suitcases are you taking?

9
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:34,738
What do you think, should I take
uncle Szymon's portrait?

10
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:38,116
Take it, don't take it,
take what you like.

11
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:40,744
Can't you see I'm worried sick?

12
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:42,704
He'll come home, he'll be alright.

13
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:46,916
- I should have another case.
- Mama, Wladek is home!

14
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:51,379
Thank God.
Wladek! You're wounded?

15
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:54,758
- No, it was nothing.
- I've been worried sick.

16
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:57,427
I told her not to worry.
You had your papers on you.

17
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:59,512
If you'd been hit by a bomb,
they'd know where to take you.

18
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:04,851
Henryk, don't say things like that.
God forbid. God forbid.

19
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,062
- Papa, Wladek is home.
- What did I tell you?

20
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:10,690
- What are you doing?
- Where's my hat with the wide brim?

21
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:15,570
- They've bombed us. We're off the air.
- Warsaw is not the only radio station.

22
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,655
Pack, darling.
Get your things packed.

23
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:19,949
- Where are we going?
- Out of Warsaw.

24
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:22,702
- Out of Warsaw where?
- You haven't heard?

25
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:25,580
- Heard what?
- Haven't you seen the paper?

26
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,333
- Where's the paper?
- I used it for packing.

27
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,960
- She used it for packing.
- The government has moved to Lublin.

28
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:35,632
All men must leave the city, go across
the river, set up a new line of defense.

29
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:39,761
There isn't anybody left here, only
the women. The men are all gone.

30
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:42,639
What do you think you'll do while
they set up a new line of defense?

31
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:46,101
- Wonder around with your suitcases?
- Pack, Wladek. There's no time.

32
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:50,063
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Good. I'm not going anywhere either.

33
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:52,941
Don't be ridiculous,
we've got to keep together.

34
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:56,486
Look. If I'm going to die, I prefer to
die in my own home, staying put.

35
00:03:56,695 --> 00:04:00,573
- God forbid.
- Shut up, I've got something. Listen.

36
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:04,953
...from the BBC in London.
The British government...

37
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:09,499
having received no reply
to the observations presented...

38
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:12,002
to the German government...

39
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:16,172
has declared war on nazi Germany.

40
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:20,093
- That's wonderful! Wonderful!
- It is expected that...

41
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:30,145
...within the next few hours, France
will make a similar declaration.

42
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:33,815
Poland is no longer alone.

43
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,156
Wonderful, wonderful!

44
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:46,828
- Mama, that was a great dinner.
- It certainly was.

45
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:49,581
When there's something to celebrate,
you've got to make an effort.

46
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:52,709
Here's to Great Britain and France!

47
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:56,713
Didn't I tell you? Didn't I tell you?
All will be well.

48
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:32,165
Five thousand and three.

49
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:37,504
- Is that all?
- Yes. It's all we've got left.

50
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:40,882
- It's 3,003 too much.
- Look.

51
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:44,469
"Further restrictions
regarding liquid assets.

52
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:47,889
Jews will be allowed to keep a
maximum of 2,000 zlotys at home."

53
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:52,560
- What do we do with the rest?
- Deposit it in a bank. Blocked account.

54
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:56,523
Banks! Who'd be stupid enough
to deposit money in a German bank?

55
00:05:56,773 --> 00:06:01,444
We could hide the money. Look here.
We can hide it under the flowerpots.

56
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:04,656
I'll tell you what we'll do.
We'll use try and tested methods.

57
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:07,325
You know what we did
in the last war?

58
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:11,413
We made a hole in the table leg,
and hid the money in there.

59
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:14,040
- Suppose they take the table away?
- What do you mean?

60
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:18,837
Germans go into Jewish homes and
take furniture, valuables, anything.

61
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,840
- Do they?
- Why'd they want a table like this?

62
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:26,094
- What on earth are you doing?
- Listen. Look.

63
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:30,390
This is the best place. No-one would
think of looking under the flowerpot.

64
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:33,727
- No, listen. I've been thinking...
- Really? That's a change.

65
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:37,188
- You know what? We use psychology.
- We use what?

66
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:42,360
We leave the money and the watch
on the table, covered. In full view.

67
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:48,116
- Are you stupid?
- The Germans will never notice it.

68
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:52,287
That's the stupidest thing I've ever
seen. Of course they'll notice. Look.

69
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:54,873
Look here.

70
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:56,916
Idiot.

71
00:06:57,334 --> 00:07:00,003
- And you call me stupid.
- Very good. That's the last place...

72
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:02,297
- This would take hours.
- We're not in a hurry.

73
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:05,633
- It won't take hours.
- How will you get them out? Tell me.

74
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:08,928
- How will you get them out?
- Quiet! Order, please!

75
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:11,806
- You reach them out individually.
- No-one listens to me!

76
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:14,893
Quiet, please, quiet.
Order, order, please.

77
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:19,397
- The lawyer, she likes order.
- Listen, just listen. Look.

78
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:23,109
The watch we put under the flowerpot
and the money we stuff in the violin.

79
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:29,824
- But I'll still be able to play?
- You'll find out.

80
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:33,787
- Jurek? It's Wladek Szpilman.
- Wladek, how are you?

81
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:37,040
We're fine, thank you.
And you?

82
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:41,461
Fine, under the circumstances.
I guess I know why you're calling.

83
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:45,924
There's nothing we can do.
They won't reopen the station.

84
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:50,887
- Yes, I know, but I...
- No music, no radio for the Polish.

85
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:54,349
But sure you'll find work.
A pianist like you.

86
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:57,018
Maybe, maybe not, but...

87
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:02,315
don't be offended, but I didn't call
to discuss my future carrier.

88
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:05,735
I nagged Jurek for weeks and weeks,
and at last he gave in and said...

89
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:09,114
"All right, come with me tomorrow",
so I came and...

90
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:11,700
they bombed the station.

91
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:15,453
- Meeting you like that was wonderful.
- Really?

92
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:19,040
Yes, it was unforgettable.

93
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,877
- I love your playing, Mr. Szpilman.
- Call me Wladek, please.

94
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:26,339
- No-one plays Chopin like you.
- I hope it's a compliment.

95
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:30,218
- Of course, I mean it.
- I was... trying to be funny.

96
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:34,723
- Should we go and have a coffee?
- I'd like that.

97
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:40,020
- And you, what do you do?
- I finished with the conservatoire.

98
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:43,189
- You're a musician?
- Yes. But only just.

99
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:45,984
- What instrument?
- The cello.

100
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,737
I love to see women
playing the cello.

101
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,199
JEWS FORBIDDEN

102
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:56,619
This is disgraceful.
How dare they?

103
00:08:56,828 --> 00:08:59,664
You know what people are like, they
want to be better nazis than Hitler.

104
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:03,752
- I'm going in there to complain.
- It's better not, believe me.

105
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:07,339
- It's humiliating. Someone like you!
- Good-bye.

106
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:14,095
We'll find somewhere else.

107
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:17,599
- We can walk in the park.
- No, we can't.

108
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:21,102
Official decree.
No Jews allowed in the park.

109
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,522
- My God. Are you joking?
- I'm not joking, it's true.

110
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:29,611
We could sit in a bench, but
"no Jews allowed on public benches".

111
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:31,613
This is absurd.

112
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:37,786
We can just stand here and talk.
I think we're allowed to do that.

113
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:43,291
So, you play the cello. That's nice.
And who's your favorite composer?

114
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,794
Chopin? Really? Well...

115
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:48,963
you'll have to learn to play
his cello sonata, won't you?

116
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:51,341
What about you, Wladek?

117
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:54,469
Perhaps I could accompany.
Me on the piano, you on the cello.

118
00:09:54,678 --> 00:09:58,973
Mr. Szpilman, you're quite,
quite wonderful.

119
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:03,353
Call me Wladek, please.

120
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:07,148
"Free emblems for Jews
in the Warsaw district.

121
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:10,318
I hereby order that all Jews
in the Warsaw district...

122
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:13,780
will wear visible emblems
when out of doors.

123
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:18,827
This decree will come into force
on the first of December, 1939...

124
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:22,455
and applies to all Jews
over 12 years of age.

125
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:26,084
The emblem will be worn
on the right sleeve...

126
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:30,046
and will represent the blue star
of David on a white background.

127
00:10:30,714 --> 00:10:33,717
The background must be
sufficiently large...

128
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:37,637
for the star to measure eight
centimeters from point to point.

129
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:42,392
The width of the arms of the star
must be one centimeter.

130
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:47,939
The Jews that do not respect this
decree will be severely punished.

131
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:52,902
Governor of the Warsaw district,
Dr. Fischer."

132
00:10:56,031 --> 00:11:00,410
- I won't wear it.
- I'm not going to be branded.

133
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:06,541
Let me see this.

134
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:14,632
Does it say that we have to provide
these armbands ourselves?

135
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:19,637
- Where will we get them?
- We're not going to wear them.

136
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:30,523
You!

137
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,735
Come here.

138
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:42,035
Why haven't you greeted us?

139
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:45,163
I'm sorry.

140
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:58,426
The sidewalk is forbidden for you.

141
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:00,720
Go to the gutter.

142
00:12:17,112 --> 00:12:21,074
- Have you seen this?
- What? What? I'm working. What?

143
00:12:22,826 --> 00:12:24,369
What is this?

144
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:29,290
- It's where they're going to put us.
- What do you mean "put us"?

145
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:35,422
"By order of the governor of the
Warsaw district, Dr. Fischer...

146
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:39,300
concerning the establishment of
the Jewish district in Warsaw.

147
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:45,140
There'll be created a Jewish district
in which Jews will have to reside."

148
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:49,811
Look here. "Jews living outside
of the prescribed area...

149
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:55,358
will have to move to the Jewish
district by 31 of October, 1940."

150
00:12:56,651 --> 00:12:58,820
They won't get all of us.
It's too small.

151
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:00,989
There's 400 thousand of us
in Warsaw.

152
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:04,743
No, 360 thousand.
So it will be easy.

153
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:08,830
What am I supposed to do?
You tell me.

154
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,377
Mama?

155
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:17,714
Mama, what is it?

156
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:22,260
20 zlotys!

157
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:25,722
That's all we have left, 20 zlotys.

158
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:32,479
What can I buy with 20 zlotys?

159
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:37,150
I'm sick of cooking potatoes,
potatoes, potatoes.

160
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:47,786
That's the price.
That's what I'm offering.

161
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:50,747
My advice is to accept.
You won't get more from anyone else.

162
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:54,876
- But it's a Bechstein!
- 2 thousand. My advice is to take it.

163
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:58,088
What are you going to do when
you're hungry? Eat the piano?

164
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:01,049
- Get out!
- What's the matter with you?

165
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:03,218
- Stop it!
- We'd rather give it away. Get out!

166
00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:06,638
Haven't you eaten today?
What are you suffering from?

167
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:09,474
You people are crazy.

168
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:13,687
I'm doing you a favor. Two thousand
and I'm paying for the removal.

169
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:16,481
I'm not even charging
for the removal!

170
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:19,943
You haven't eaten today.
You're crazy.

171
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:21,986
Take it.

172
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:58,189
Hello.

173
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:01,735
Hello. Hi.

174
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,156
I didn't want to come.

175
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:10,910
I didn't want to see all this, but...
I couldn't stop myself.

176
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:13,079
- How are you doing?
- Fine.

177
00:15:13,288 --> 00:15:15,248
Good.

178
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:19,169
No, not really.
They arrested my cousin.

179
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:21,713
Jurek says they'll let him out.

180
00:15:23,048 --> 00:15:27,552
- This is disgraceful.
- It won't last long. Don't worry.

181
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:30,722
That's what I said myself.

182
00:15:31,306 --> 00:15:33,600
It's too absurd.

183
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:40,815
I... I should go.

184
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:45,612
Well, I'll see you...

185
00:15:46,196 --> 00:15:47,572
soon.

186
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:54,287
Good-bye.

187
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:10,637
Well...

188
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:14,974
to tell you the truth,
I thought it would be worse.

189
00:16:21,231 --> 00:16:25,610
- Where will we sleep?
- I sleep in the kitchen with the girls.

190
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:28,780
You, Henryk and papa, in here.

191
00:16:30,365 --> 00:16:32,367
Look.

192
00:16:33,618 --> 00:16:35,829
Come and look.

193
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:10,113
Go away.

194
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:12,574
Go away! Go away!

195
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:16,786
Papa! Papa!

196
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:36,097
- Sell anything?
- Just one. Dostoievski, "The Idiot".

197
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:38,933
- 3 zlotys.
- It's better than yesterday.

198
00:17:39,142 --> 00:17:43,438
Three lousy zlotys. And there are
people there making millions.

199
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:46,316
- I know.
- You don't know, believe me.

200
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:49,944
They bribe the guards,
the guards turn a blind eye.

201
00:17:50,153 --> 00:17:54,949
They bring cartloads of food,
tobacco, liquor, French cosmetics.

202
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:56,993
And the poor are dying all around
and they don't give a damn.

203
00:17:57,327 --> 00:18:00,955
Excuse me, have you seen
my husband, Izaak Szerman?

204
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:05,418
A tall handsome man,
with a little gray beard.

205
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:10,131
- I'm afraid not.
- Excuse me. Good-bye.

206
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:14,052
Sleep well. But if you see him,
write to me, yes?

207
00:18:14,886 --> 00:18:16,262
Izaak Szerman.

208
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:34,489
Why do we have to have a gentile
street running through our area?

209
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:36,866
Why can't they go around?

210
00:18:37,117 --> 00:18:40,787
Don't worry. They're about to build
a bridge. Haven't you heard?

211
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:43,707
A bridge! Those idiots.

212
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:47,460
The Germans claim to be intelligent.

213
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:51,256
But do you know what I think?
I think they're totally stupid.

214
00:18:51,506 --> 00:18:54,384
I have a family to feed.
I spend half of my time here...

215
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:56,928
waiting for them to let us through.

216
00:18:57,762 --> 00:19:00,348
Maybe they think I come here
to listen to the music?

217
00:19:00,849 --> 00:19:05,687
- What is it? Are you in a hurry?
- What's wrong with you?

218
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:10,275
- Come on, do something.
- Right. Dance!

219
00:19:10,525 --> 00:19:13,236
- Dance!
- Dance!

220
00:19:13,445 --> 00:19:16,322
Come on, come on! Dance!

221
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:21,369
Very well.

222
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:23,580
What about you?
Dance with him.

223
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:29,294
Let's clear the street,
so the Jews can dance.

224
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,924
Come on. And you.

225
00:19:41,014 --> 00:19:42,682
Go on.

226
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:45,226
Faster!

227
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:49,064
Come on!

228
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:51,816
Faster!

229
00:19:55,612 --> 00:19:57,364
Come on!

230
00:19:58,239 --> 00:20:00,867
Faster!

231
00:20:03,161 --> 00:20:07,791
Come on, move! I said faster!
Come on, Jews!

232
00:20:07,999 --> 00:20:11,002
- Keep dancing.
- Dance.

233
00:20:29,813 --> 00:20:31,564
Good, they're here.

234
00:20:33,191 --> 00:20:36,152
Itzak Heller has been
waiting for you.

235
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:43,993
- What's this about?
- Sit down, have tea.

236
00:20:44,202 --> 00:20:46,579
I'll start lunch
when the girls get here.

237
00:20:52,502 --> 00:20:55,839
- So, what are you doing here?
- He brought cakes.

238
00:20:56,047 --> 00:21:01,678
His father is back in the jewelry
business. He's doing well.

239
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:06,683
Amazing, jewelry.

240
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:09,227
- We're recruiting.
- Who is recruiting?

241
00:21:09,436 --> 00:21:11,896
Don't be clever with me.
I'm coming as a friend.

242
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:14,315
They're bringing Jews in
from all over the country.

243
00:21:14,524 --> 00:21:16,609
Soon there will be half million people
in the ghetto.

244
00:21:16,818 --> 00:21:20,780
- We need more Jewish police.
- More Jewish police!

245
00:21:20,947 --> 00:21:24,451
You want me to beat up Jews
and catch the Gestapo spirit. I see.

246
00:21:25,076 --> 00:21:27,203
- Someone has got to do it.
- But why me?

247
00:21:27,412 --> 00:21:29,789
I thought you only recruited boys
with rich fathers.

248
00:21:29,998 --> 00:21:32,042
Look at my father, look at us...

249
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:35,337
I'm looking at you, that's why I'm
here. You can have a better life.

250
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:39,007
- You want to survive selling books?
- Yes, please.

251
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:42,552
I'm doing you people a favor.

252
00:21:43,053 --> 00:21:45,513
What about you?
You're a great pianist.

253
00:21:45,722 --> 00:21:48,183
We've got a police jazz band.
They'd welcome you with open arms.

254
00:21:48,433 --> 00:21:51,519
- Join us. You've got no work.
- Thank you, I've got work.

255
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,779
I'm sorry, he wants you to stop.

256
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,701
Who wants me to stop?

257
00:23:39,002 --> 00:23:40,795
I always say,
look on the bright side.

258
00:23:41,171 --> 00:23:44,466
You're in a small ghetto with
intellectuals, professional people.

259
00:23:44,674 --> 00:23:48,219
You're better off than us. Here in
the large ghetto it's a cesspool.

260
00:23:48,428 --> 00:23:51,556
- You have to give me something.
- You're an artist...

261
00:23:51,806 --> 00:23:53,808
you keep peoples' spirits up.
You do enough.

262
00:23:54,017 --> 00:23:57,604
- I want to help, do something.
- You're too well known.

263
00:23:57,812 --> 00:24:02,734
And you know what? You musicians
don't make good conspirators.

264
00:24:02,901 --> 00:24:07,030
You're too... too musical.

265
00:24:12,911 --> 00:24:14,037
- Who is that?
- Symche.

266
00:24:14,245 --> 00:24:16,373
Majorek.

267
00:24:17,374 --> 00:24:20,585
There are notices going up. City is
to be cleansed of the undesirables.

268
00:24:20,794 --> 00:24:23,838
- There's always notices going up.
- Hello, Symche.

269
00:24:24,923 --> 00:24:28,218
Dyrek. Mrs. Ysken.

270
00:24:29,886 --> 00:24:32,013
Jehuda, working hard?

271
00:24:32,222 --> 00:24:36,184
This is the greatest pianist in
Poland. Maybe the whole world.

272
00:24:36,434 --> 00:24:39,312
Wladyslaw Szpilman,
meet Majorek.

273
00:24:39,521 --> 00:24:41,356
- How do you do?
- I know your name.

274
00:24:42,482 --> 00:24:45,068
- I've never heard you play.
- Majorek used to be in the Army.

275
00:24:45,819 --> 00:24:50,281
Brilliant man. The only thing I've got
against him is he's not a socialist.

276
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:54,994
You better go now, Wladek.
It's nearly curfew.

277
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:58,998
You know how many copies
we print of our newspaper?

278
00:24:59,416 --> 00:25:01,209
Five hundred.

279
00:25:01,418 --> 00:25:04,754
You know how many people on
average read one copy? Twenty.

280
00:25:04,963 --> 00:25:09,551
That makes 10 thousand readers.
This will start the uprising.

281
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:13,054
Majorek hides them in his underpants
and leaves them in toilets.

282
00:25:13,221 --> 00:25:16,099
- Toilets?
- As many toilets as I can find.

283
00:25:16,307 --> 00:25:18,852
Germans never use Jewish toilets.

284
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:21,021
They're too clean for them.

285
00:25:27,318 --> 00:25:29,821
Please, mister, please.

286
00:25:57,891 --> 00:26:01,311
Hold it!
You little bastard!

287
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:06,316
Take this!

288
00:26:06,524 --> 00:26:08,568
Stop it! Stop it!

289
00:26:09,486 --> 00:26:10,570
Stop it!

290
00:26:13,323 --> 00:26:16,451
Come on, come on.
Come on, boy.

291
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:26,461
Stand up! Stand up.

292
00:26:56,408 --> 00:27:01,121
Please, tonight for once, I don't
want anything bad talked about.

293
00:27:01,329 --> 00:27:04,916
- Enjoy your meal.
- Then I'll tell you something funny.

294
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:08,128
- You know who I mean by Dr. Raszeja?
- The surgeon.

295
00:27:08,336 --> 00:27:13,174
The Germans allowed him into
the ghetto to perform an operation.

296
00:27:13,341 --> 00:27:16,469
On a Jew? They let a Pole
to come in to operate on a Jew?

297
00:27:16,678 --> 00:27:20,140
He got a pass, that's all I know.
Anyway, so...

298
00:27:20,348 --> 00:27:22,726
he puts the patient to sleep
and starts the operation.

299
00:27:22,934 --> 00:27:25,228
He'd just made the first incision
when the SS burst in...

300
00:27:25,895 --> 00:27:30,025
shoot the patient, then Dr. Raszeja
and everybody else who was there.

301
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,821
Isn't that a laugh?

302
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:38,908
The patient didn't feel a thing,
he was anesthetized.

303
00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:40,952
I said nothing bad.

304
00:27:41,619 --> 00:27:45,415
What's the matter with you all?
You lost your sense of humor?

305
00:27:46,541 --> 00:27:48,293
It's not funny.

306
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:51,880
You know what's funny? You're
funny, with that ridiculous tie.

307
00:27:53,256 --> 00:27:56,259
What are you talking about? What's
my tie have to do with anything?

308
00:27:56,634 --> 00:27:58,762
- I need this tie for my work.
- Your work?

309
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:03,183
- That's right, I work.
- Playing the piano for the parasites.

310
00:28:03,391 --> 00:28:06,561
- Parasites...
- Boys. Boys!

311
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:09,314
- They don't give a damn.
- And you blame me for their apathy?

312
00:28:09,522 --> 00:28:13,109
I see it everyday. They don't even
notice what's going around them.

313
00:28:13,318 --> 00:28:15,236
- I blame the Americans.
- For what? For my tie?

314
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:18,615
The American Jews,
and there are lots of them.

315
00:28:19,616 --> 00:28:22,952
What do they think they're doing?
People here are dying.

316
00:28:23,161 --> 00:28:25,455
Haven't got a bite to eat.

317
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:30,877
The Jewish bankers should persuade
America to declare war on Germany.

318
00:28:47,811 --> 00:28:49,979
The lights! The lights!

319
00:29:07,914 --> 00:29:12,210
Turn on the lights.

320
00:29:14,796 --> 00:29:17,507
Come on!

321
00:29:20,427 --> 00:29:24,764
Open the door!
We want to go in!

322
00:29:26,725 --> 00:29:28,643
Open the door!

323
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:44,576
Stand up!

324
00:29:46,703 --> 00:29:50,290
You, stand up! Come on!

325
00:29:50,957 --> 00:29:53,460
Throw him out!

326
00:30:06,639 --> 00:30:08,850
Mama...

327
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:24,699
Come on, run!

328
00:31:31,433 --> 00:31:35,937
- I'm Mr. Szpilman's sister.
- Go in. Not you.

329
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:57,876
- What?
- Come. It's terrible.

330
00:31:58,126 --> 00:32:01,254
- What?
- They're hunting people in the streets.

331
00:32:01,421 --> 00:32:03,631
They've taken Henryk.

332
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:08,303
Go home, alright? Go home,
I'll take care of it.

333
00:32:19,981 --> 00:32:23,693
Excuse me. Have you seen
my husband? Izaak Szerman?

334
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:27,781
- I'm afraid not.
- Tall, handsome, little gray beard.

335
00:32:27,947 --> 00:32:31,659
If you see him, write to me.
Don't forget. Izaak Szerman.

336
00:32:41,628 --> 00:32:43,380
What happened here?

337
00:32:43,588 --> 00:32:47,342
They've got my grandson. They
pick them up and take them away.

338
00:32:47,592 --> 00:32:51,304
What they do to them,
I've stopped believing in God.

339
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:55,058
Excuse me. Excuse me.

340
00:32:56,101 --> 00:32:57,977
Itzak?

341
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,063
Itzak?

342
00:33:00,271 --> 00:33:03,775
Itzak, it's Wladek Szpilman.

343
00:33:10,031 --> 00:33:12,617
- Henryk is in there.
- I haven't seen him.

344
00:33:12,784 --> 00:33:14,911
Believe me.
They picked him up.

345
00:33:19,249 --> 00:33:23,294
- Can you help?
- Now you need me. Now you need me!

346
00:33:23,461 --> 00:33:25,714
Can you help us?

347
00:33:26,381 --> 00:33:29,050
- It costs.
- I have no money.

348
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,886
Then there's nothing I can do.
You should have joined us.

349
00:33:32,095 --> 00:33:36,474
- They told me you had influence.
- Who told you?

350
00:33:36,725 --> 00:33:40,228
People I know. They said
you're an important man.

351
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,358
Itzak...

352
00:34:01,291 --> 00:34:04,294
- Hands up.
- How are you?

353
00:34:04,461 --> 00:34:08,214
- How are you?
- You, bandit.

354
00:34:08,381 --> 00:34:10,550
Dead! Dead!

355
00:34:10,759 --> 00:34:13,970
- He's crazy.
- Hands up.

356
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:17,307
- Want a cigarette?
- Cigarette?

357
00:34:17,807 --> 00:34:20,852
Thank you.

358
00:34:21,561 --> 00:34:25,523
Everything is alright!

359
00:34:25,732 --> 00:34:27,859
He looks very happy.

360
00:34:28,026 --> 00:34:30,904
Everything is alright.

361
00:34:31,112 --> 00:34:34,532
Everything is alright.

362
00:34:35,075 --> 00:34:38,661
Hands up! Hands up!

363
00:34:39,204 --> 00:34:40,538
It's alright.

364
00:34:42,332 --> 00:34:44,501
Help! Help!

365
00:34:44,709 --> 00:34:48,380
Let go! Help!

366
00:35:41,641 --> 00:35:45,145
- Why did they pick you up?
- So you go to Itzak Heller?

367
00:35:45,353 --> 00:35:48,898
- Did I ask you to talk to him?
- You're out, aren't you?

368
00:35:49,107 --> 00:35:54,029
- Did you beg to that piece of shit?
- I asked him to help you.

369
00:35:54,696 --> 00:35:56,865
What did you pay him?

370
00:35:57,866 --> 00:36:02,412
With what could I pay him? Every
zloty I earn we spend on food.

371
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:05,623
- I can look after myself.
- They were taking you away.

372
00:36:05,832 --> 00:36:09,794
It's got nothing to do with you.
It's me they wanted, not you.

373
00:36:10,003 --> 00:36:13,298
Why do you have to interfere
with other people's business?

374
00:36:13,465 --> 00:36:17,635
- You're mad. That's your trouble.
- That's also my business.

375
00:36:26,895 --> 00:36:30,190
What's the matter?
Are you sick?

376
00:36:31,232 --> 00:36:33,651
Hungry.

377
00:36:40,825 --> 00:36:45,205
Employment certificate. What's that
mean, no employment certificate?

378
00:36:45,455 --> 00:36:48,249
You have to have an
employment certificate...

379
00:36:48,458 --> 00:36:51,044
to work for the Germans
in the ghetto, otherwise...

380
00:36:51,294 --> 00:36:54,089
- Otherwise what?
- You'll be deported.

381
00:36:54,297 --> 00:36:57,676
- So the rumors were true.
- They're going to resettle us...

382
00:36:58,551 --> 00:37:01,680
and send us to labor camps,
in the East.

383
00:37:03,598 --> 00:37:06,643
- They're closing the small ghetto.
- Oh, God!

384
00:37:21,908 --> 00:37:23,827
Wladek? Wladek?

385
00:37:24,911 --> 00:37:28,790
I thought you were on tour playing
in London, Paris, New York, Chicago.

386
00:37:28,998 --> 00:37:31,751
- Not this week.
- You look terrible.

387
00:37:32,127 --> 00:37:34,963
Have you heard the rumors? They're
going to resettle us in the East.

388
00:37:35,171 --> 00:37:39,300
Rumors! You take it all too much
to heart. What's the trouble?

389
00:37:39,551 --> 00:37:43,930
I've been trying to get the certificate
of employment for my father.

390
00:37:44,139 --> 00:37:47,559
I managed to get one for me and my
family, but I need one for my father.

391
00:37:47,767 --> 00:37:50,937
- I've been to all the firms and shops...
- Why didn't you come to me?

392
00:37:51,187 --> 00:37:53,356
I didn't know you were
in the certificate business.

393
00:37:53,565 --> 00:37:55,942
I'm not, but Majorek is.

394
00:37:58,069 --> 00:38:00,238
Can you help?
I have no money.

395
00:38:00,488 --> 00:38:03,908
Please, don't insult us.
Can you do something for him?

396
00:38:04,117 --> 00:38:06,536
Be at the Schultz workshop
tomorrow, four o'clock.

397
00:38:06,786 --> 00:38:09,497
See what a wonderful piece
of luck you've had today?

398
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:13,543
That's the historical imperative in
action! That's why I always say:

399
00:38:13,752 --> 00:38:16,171
- "Look on the bright side!"
- Yes, I know.

400
00:38:29,267 --> 00:38:31,895
- How's your back?
- Better.

401
00:38:32,062 --> 00:38:34,064
Better?

402
00:38:34,272 --> 00:38:36,232
Better not ask.

403
00:38:49,329 --> 00:38:54,459
- Thank you.
- My pleasure. Won't help you anyway.

404
00:38:56,878 --> 00:38:59,214
Thank you, Mr. Schultz.

405
00:40:10,118 --> 00:40:13,246
At least we got work
in the ghetto.

406
00:40:14,122 --> 00:40:16,583
At least we are still together.

407
00:40:30,638 --> 00:40:33,350
Everybody out!
To the courtyard!

408
00:40:33,558 --> 00:40:35,894
Move, move!

409
00:40:36,478 --> 00:40:40,857
We are workers. We have
employment certification.

410
00:40:44,694 --> 00:40:46,780
Wait.

411
00:40:47,572 --> 00:40:48,573
Here.

412
00:40:48,823 --> 00:40:51,951
Go over there. Hurry.

413
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,162
You.

414
00:40:54,537 --> 00:40:57,248
You. You.

415
00:40:59,042 --> 00:41:00,835
You.

416
00:41:02,545 --> 00:41:04,422
You.

417
00:41:05,924 --> 00:41:08,093
You.

418
00:41:16,935 --> 00:41:20,313
The others, put your clothes on
and come back here.

419
00:41:20,522 --> 00:41:23,692
Bring your things with you.
15 kilos only.

420
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:26,820
Where are you taking us?

421
00:41:50,593 --> 00:41:53,138
I'm sorry, I did my best.

422
00:41:55,473 --> 00:41:58,476
- I thought the certificates'd save us.
- Stop it, Wladek.

423
00:41:58,727 --> 00:42:02,272
Let's just hope that Henryk
and Halina will be better off.

424
00:42:29,883 --> 00:42:32,177
- Where will we be going?
- You're going to work.

425
00:42:32,344 --> 00:42:35,805
You'll be much better off than
in the stinking ghetto. Move.

426
00:42:40,393 --> 00:42:44,356
Why did I do it? Why did I do it?

427
00:42:45,065 --> 00:42:50,403
Why did I do it?
Why did I do it?

428
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:55,241
Why did I do it?

429
00:43:38,535 --> 00:43:41,204
Don't you have a bottle of water?
He 's dying.

430
00:43:41,413 --> 00:43:43,331
My child is dying of thirst.

431
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:45,417
- I beg you.
- I'm sorry.

432
00:43:45,583 --> 00:43:49,462
- Don't you have water? I beg you.
- Can you hear what I'm saying?

433
00:43:49,671 --> 00:43:52,007
- I'm telling you, it's a disgrace.
- I can hear you.

434
00:43:52,215 --> 00:43:54,509
Letting them take us to our death
like sheep to the slaughter.

435
00:43:54,718 --> 00:43:56,928
- Not so loud.
- Why don't we attack them?

436
00:43:57,137 --> 00:44:00,265
There's half a million of us here.
We can break out of the ghetto.

437
00:44:00,473 --> 00:44:03,184
At least we can die honorably, not
as a stain on the face of History.

438
00:44:03,393 --> 00:44:06,104
Why are you so sure they're
sending us to our death?

439
00:44:06,312 --> 00:44:08,898
You know why I'm not sure?
Because they didn't tell me.

440
00:44:09,482 --> 00:44:13,153
- They're going to wipe us all out.
- What do you want me to do? Fight?

441
00:44:13,361 --> 00:44:15,947
To fight, we need organization,
plans, guns.

442
00:44:16,156 --> 00:44:18,783
He's right. Do you think I'm going
to fight with my violin bowl?

443
00:44:18,992 --> 00:44:21,828
The Germans would never squander
a huge labor force like this.

444
00:44:22,412 --> 00:44:24,539
They're sending us to a labor camp,
it's obvious.

445
00:44:24,706 --> 00:44:26,041
Sure.

446
00:44:26,249 --> 00:44:30,712
Look at that cripple, the old people,
the children. They're going to work?

447
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:34,674
Look at you. You're going to carry
logs on your back?

448
00:45:16,675 --> 00:45:19,928
Henryk! Halina, Henryk!

449
00:45:29,938 --> 00:45:34,275
I missed you.
I wanted to be with you!

450
00:45:43,118 --> 00:45:45,620
I wanted to be with you!

451
00:45:45,870 --> 00:45:47,997
Stupid. Stupid.

452
00:45:48,331 --> 00:45:52,544
Why did I do it? Why did I do it?

453
00:45:52,752 --> 00:45:56,089
She's getting on my nerves.

454
00:46:00,093 --> 00:46:05,056
- What did she do, for God's sake?
- She smothered her baby.

455
00:46:07,017 --> 00:46:10,562
They prepared a hiding place
and of course they went there.

456
00:46:10,812 --> 00:46:13,648
The baby cried
just as the police came.

457
00:46:13,857 --> 00:46:17,986
She smothered the cries with
her hands, the baby died.

458
00:46:19,279 --> 00:46:23,074
A policeman heard the death rattle
and found where they were hiding.

459
00:46:48,224 --> 00:46:50,477
What are you reading?

460
00:46:52,979 --> 00:46:57,817
"If you prick us, de we not bleed?
If you tickle us, do we not laugh?

461
00:46:57,984 --> 00:47:00,278
If you poison us, do we not die?

462
00:47:00,487 --> 00:47:03,615
And, if you wrong us,
shall we not revenge?"

463
00:47:11,206 --> 00:47:14,751
- Very appropriate.
- Yes. That's why I brought it.

464
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:36,189
Idiot. What does he think
he's gonna do with the money?

465
00:47:37,273 --> 00:47:40,026
Boy, come here.

466
00:47:40,777 --> 00:47:42,570
Come here.

467
00:47:43,905 --> 00:47:45,907
- How much for a caramel?
- 20 zlotys.

468
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:49,577
For one caramel? What do you think
you're gonna do with the money?

469
00:47:49,744 --> 00:47:52,080
20 zlotys.

470
00:47:53,623 --> 00:47:55,792
We've got 20 between us.

471
00:47:56,042 --> 00:47:58,628
I've got 10, I think.

472
00:48:01,381 --> 00:48:04,134
5, 10, 20.

473
00:49:26,841 --> 00:49:29,678
- Halina?
- What?

474
00:49:31,096 --> 00:49:35,058
- It's a funny time to say this, but...
- What?

475
00:49:36,059 --> 00:49:39,562
I wish I knew you better.

476
00:49:42,273 --> 00:49:44,359
Thank you.

477
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:02,460
Szpilman?

478
00:50:12,137 --> 00:50:14,597
Papa? Papa?

479
00:50:16,975 --> 00:50:19,310
Mama? Halina?

480
00:50:19,936 --> 00:50:22,480
Halina? Mama?

481
00:50:23,148 --> 00:50:28,153
What do you think you're doing?
I've saved your life. Just go! Go!

482
00:50:31,781 --> 00:50:34,075
Don't run!

483
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:37,704
Anna!

484
00:50:37,912 --> 00:50:40,331
Anna!

485
00:51:00,018 --> 00:51:03,104
Off they go to the melting pot.

486
00:51:06,191 --> 00:51:10,945
- This stays.
- Give it to me!

487
00:51:16,034 --> 00:51:18,787
What are you doing?
She's pregnant.

488
00:53:45,850 --> 00:53:47,811
Wladek?

489
00:54:05,995 --> 00:54:09,040
Why are you here, Wladek?

490
00:54:09,290 --> 00:54:11,960
It's like this, I...

491
00:54:13,586 --> 00:54:15,505
We...

492
00:54:17,799 --> 00:54:20,760
All of them, all of them.

493
00:54:20,969 --> 00:54:23,221
All of them.

494
00:54:24,305 --> 00:54:28,268
Perhaps they're lucky.
The quicker, the better.

495
00:54:28,476 --> 00:54:31,646
It's not finished yet. We'll stay
here for a couple of days...

496
00:54:31,855 --> 00:54:33,857
until things die down.

497
00:54:34,024 --> 00:54:37,610
I've bribed the policeman,
he'll come when it's over.

498
00:54:39,821 --> 00:54:43,575
Attention!
On the march!

499
00:54:53,543 --> 00:54:55,503
Onward!

500
00:54:57,881 --> 00:55:01,051
My God, I haven't been outside in,
it must be two years.

501
00:55:01,259 --> 00:55:04,220
Don't get overexcited.

502
00:55:20,236 --> 00:55:23,448
It's gold.
Very good price.

503
00:55:44,469 --> 00:55:46,429
Someone you know?

504
00:55:46,638 --> 00:55:48,640
A beauty.
Who is she?

505
00:55:48,848 --> 00:55:52,936
She's a singer. I knew her well.
Her husband is an actor.

506
00:55:53,103 --> 00:55:55,522
They're good people.
I'd like to talk to her.

507
00:55:55,730 --> 00:55:59,609
Don't forget, Wladek.
They hang them for helping Jews.

508
00:56:26,428 --> 00:56:28,847
Turn left!

509
00:56:29,055 --> 00:56:31,516
On the march!

510
00:56:35,729 --> 00:56:38,523
Stop! Halt!
Attention!

511
00:56:45,822 --> 00:56:48,742
At ease.

512
00:56:52,871 --> 00:56:55,582
Turn right!

513
00:57:02,756 --> 00:57:05,467
Step forward.

514
00:57:06,092 --> 00:57:07,594
You.

515
00:57:09,846 --> 00:57:12,474
You. You.

516
00:57:13,183 --> 00:57:15,060
You.

517
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:21,024
Down on the ground!

518
00:57:21,232 --> 00:57:24,402
Down on the ground!

519
00:57:51,721 --> 00:57:53,848
Turn left!

520
00:57:55,016 --> 00:57:57,435
On the march.

521
00:58:37,475 --> 00:58:39,769
How long have you been here?

522
00:58:39,978 --> 00:58:42,897
Since last night.

523
00:58:43,064 --> 00:58:45,483
I was pleased to see you.

524
00:58:49,404 --> 00:58:52,741
They're going to start
the final resettlement now.

525
00:58:54,617 --> 00:58:56,953
We know what it means.

526
00:58:57,996 --> 00:59:01,916
We sent someone out.
Zygmund, a good man.

527
00:59:04,461 --> 00:59:07,922
His orders were to follow
the trains out of Warsaw.

528
00:59:09,299 --> 00:59:11,468
He got to Sokolow.

529
00:59:11,718 --> 00:59:16,431
A man told him the tracks divided,
one branch's leading to Treblinka.

530
00:59:18,141 --> 00:59:22,020
He said everyday freight trains
carrying people from Warsaw...

531
00:59:22,228 --> 00:59:26,232
branch off to Treblinka
and return empty.

532
00:59:26,441 --> 00:59:29,527
No transports of food
are ever seen on that line.

533
00:59:30,278 --> 00:59:33,740
The civilians are forbidden
to approach the Treblinka station.

534
00:59:37,786 --> 00:59:40,080
They're exterminating us.

535
00:59:43,917 --> 00:59:46,544
It won't take them long.

536
00:59:47,962 --> 00:59:51,508
We are 60 thousand left,
out of half a million.

537
00:59:52,342 --> 00:59:54,928
Mostly young people.

538
00:59:56,221 --> 00:59:59,307
And this time we're gonna fight.

539
01:00:01,059 --> 01:00:03,770
We're in good shape.

540
01:00:04,020 --> 01:00:07,941
Organized.
We're prepared.

541
01:00:08,149 --> 01:00:10,985
If you need help, I...

542
01:00:30,505 --> 01:00:33,842
You! Come here!

543
01:00:34,926 --> 01:00:36,678
Shit!

544
01:00:44,686 --> 01:00:47,105
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

545
01:00:48,231 --> 01:00:50,775
I don't know what I was thinking.

546
01:01:00,076 --> 01:01:04,497
Take this! Take this!

547
01:01:19,137 --> 01:01:21,973
Take him away.

548
01:01:37,364 --> 01:01:41,284
I hope you play the piano better
than you carry bricks.

549
01:01:42,911 --> 01:01:45,497
He won't last long
if he goes on like this.

550
01:01:45,663 --> 01:01:48,583
I'll see if I can get him
something better.

551
01:02:11,356 --> 01:02:13,066
Trouble.

552
01:02:13,274 --> 01:02:15,819
Round up only the Jews!

553
01:02:16,027 --> 01:02:19,030
Round up!
Only the Jews.

554
01:02:19,239 --> 01:02:22,659
The Polish keep working.
Only the Jews.

555
01:02:29,874 --> 01:02:32,836
I have good news for you.

556
01:02:33,044 --> 01:02:37,924
There are rumors going around
that we like to...

557
01:02:38,174 --> 01:02:41,094
to resettle you.

558
01:02:42,971 --> 01:02:48,059
I promise you that now
and in the future...

559
01:02:48,226 --> 01:02:51,813
nothing else is planned.

560
01:02:52,856 --> 01:02:59,195
For this reason, we put
information posters on the wall.

561
01:03:00,488 --> 01:03:03,825
To show you our goodwill...

562
01:03:04,034 --> 01:03:07,996
you should vote one of you
to be allowed...

563
01:03:08,204 --> 01:03:11,207
to go in town daily...

564
01:03:11,624 --> 01:03:17,797
and bring 3 kilos of potatoes...

565
01:03:18,006 --> 01:03:22,469
and one loaf of bread
for each of your workers.

566
01:03:22,677 --> 01:03:28,141
So, why should we do something
like this if we'd resettle you?

567
01:03:29,351 --> 01:03:34,731
You can make good business
out of the things you don't eat.

568
01:03:36,274 --> 01:03:41,905
Isn't that something that you Jews
are good in? Making money?

569
01:03:45,909 --> 01:03:47,077
Dismiss them.

570
01:04:03,426 --> 01:04:07,347
That one, with the string.
The others, tied by wire.

571
01:05:16,082 --> 01:05:17,250
Now!

572
01:05:54,788 --> 01:05:56,790
Majorek.

573
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:01,461
I have a favor to ask.

574
01:06:02,128 --> 01:06:04,422
I want to get out of here.

575
01:06:07,217 --> 01:06:11,721
It's easy to get out. It's how you'll
survive on the other side that's hard.

576
01:06:11,930 --> 01:06:14,182
I know.

577
01:06:15,016 --> 01:06:18,895
Last summer, I worked for a day
in the Zelazna Brama Square.

578
01:06:19,062 --> 01:06:22,524
I saw someone I knew,
she's an old friend.

579
01:06:22,732 --> 01:06:26,236
A singer, her husband
is an actor.

580
01:06:27,779 --> 01:06:31,825
I've filled their names down and
their address, if they're still there.

581
01:06:32,033 --> 01:06:36,955
Janina Godlewska and Andrzej
Bogucki. They're good people.

582
01:06:37,997 --> 01:06:40,959
Would you try to make contact?

583
01:06:42,085 --> 01:06:47,799
You go to town everyday. Ask them
if they'd help me get out of here.

584
01:07:20,790 --> 01:07:23,460
Have you got any plaster?

585
01:07:32,844 --> 01:07:36,097
What are you up to?

586
01:07:37,724 --> 01:07:40,226
What have you got there?

587
01:07:40,435 --> 01:07:44,439
We are allowed to take
food to the ghetto.

588
01:07:44,647 --> 01:07:47,442
Three kilos of potato and bread.

589
01:07:47,650 --> 01:07:49,778
Open it.

590
01:07:53,531 --> 01:07:58,536
- It's only potatoes and bread.
- You're lying. That's not true.

591
01:07:59,913 --> 01:08:02,082
Open it.

592
01:08:30,068 --> 01:08:32,237
Potatoes!

593
01:08:35,865 --> 01:08:38,910
You Jews are all alike.

594
01:08:39,119 --> 01:08:42,831
We reach you with a finger...

595
01:08:43,039 --> 01:08:46,084
and you take the whole hand.

596
01:08:59,347 --> 01:09:03,768
If you lie to me again,
I'll kill you. Personally.

597
01:09:27,709 --> 01:09:30,003
I've tried your friends.

598
01:09:30,211 --> 01:09:33,631
- They don't live there anymore.
- Did you make contact?

599
01:09:34,174 --> 01:09:36,301
- Be ready to leave.
- When?

600
01:09:36,468 --> 01:09:38,428
- Soon.
- Halt!

601
01:09:40,096 --> 01:09:42,015
Shit! Shit!

602
01:09:42,182 --> 01:09:44,851
Wait. What's going on here?

603
01:09:45,060 --> 01:09:48,772
Take this! Take this!

604
01:09:54,986 --> 01:09:59,032
I'll teach you some discipline,
you dirty Jews.

605
01:10:03,411 --> 01:10:05,705
Do you know why
you're being hit?

606
01:10:05,914 --> 01:10:09,125
- No.
- Do you know why you're being hit?

607
01:10:09,334 --> 01:10:13,797
- Why?
- To celebrate New Year.
