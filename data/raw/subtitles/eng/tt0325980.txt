1
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:35,035
Drink up me 'earties yo ho!

2
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:39,205
We kidnap and ravage and don't give a hoot.

3
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:43,418
Drink up me 'earties yo ho!

4
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:49,382
Yo ho yo ho a pirate's life for me.

5
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:55,805
We extort, we pilfer, we filch and sack.
Drink up

6
00:00:56,348 --> 00:01:00,352
Quiet, missy,
cursed pirates sail these waters.

7
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:01,936
You don't want to bring them
down on us now, do ya?

8
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:05,940
- Mr. Gibbs that will do!
- She was singing about pirates.

9
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:12,405
Bad luck to be singing about pirates with us
mired in this unnatural fog. Mark my words.

10
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:14,324
Consider them marked.

11
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:16,785
On your way.

12
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:17,619
Aye, Lieutenant.

13
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:22,082
It's bad luck to have a woman on board, too,
even a miniature one.

14
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:26,002
I think it'd be rather exciting
to meet a pirate.

15
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,922
Think again, Miss Swann.

16
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:32,967
Vile and dissolute creatures,
the lot of them.

17
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:35,970
I intend to see to that any man who sails
under a pirate flag or...

18
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,765
...wears a pirate brand
gets what he deserves.

19
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:42,143
A short drop and a sudden stop.

20
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:47,774
Lieutenant Norrington,
I appreciate your fervor.

21
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:52,737
But I'm...I'm concerned about the effect
this subject will have upon my daughter.

22
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:54,948
My apologies, Governor Swann.

23
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:58,952
- Actually, I find it all fascinating.
- Yes, that's what concerns me.

24
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:29,232
Look, a boy!
There's a boy in the water!

25
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:33,820
Man overboard!

26
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:39,117
Haul him aboard!

27
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:50,211
He's still breathing.

28
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:52,172
Mary, Mother of God!

29
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:00,347
What happened here?

30
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:04,267
It's most likely the powder magazine.
Merchant vessels run heavily armed.

31
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:09,439
A lot of good it did them.

32
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:13,443
Everyone's thinking it.
I'm just saying it...pirates!

33
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:18,073
There's no proof of that.
It was probably an accident.

34
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:21,993
- Rouse the Captain immediately!
- Aye, sir.

35
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:24,454
Heave to and take in sail,
launch the boats.

36
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:31,753
Elizabeth I want you to accompany the boy.
He'll be in your charge.

37
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:34,673
Take care of him.

38
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:55,151
It's ok.

39
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:57,570
My name's Elizabeth Swann.

40
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,949
Will Turner.

41
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:03,368
I'm watching over you, Will.

42
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:19,259
- You're a pirate!
- Has he said anything?

43
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:23,054
His name is William Turner,
that's all I found out.

44
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:25,974
Take him below.

45
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:38,463
Elizabeth!

46
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:41,007
Are you alright?

47
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:46,346
- Are you decent?
- Yes, yes!

48
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:52,185
Still abed at this hour?
It's a beautiful day.

49
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:56,856
I have a gift for you.

50
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:02,654
- Oh, it's beautiful!
- Isn't it?

51
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:05,949
May I inquire as to the occasion?

52
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:09,953
Does a father need an occasion
to dote upon his daughter?

53
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:12,163
Go on.

54
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:17,544
Actually, I, uh...

55
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,964
I had hoped you might wear
it for the ceremony today.

56
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:21,965
The ceremony?

57
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:24,968
Captain Norringtons
promotion ceremony.

58
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,761
I knew it!

59
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:30,265
Commodore Norrington
he's about to become.

60
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:33,935
Fine gentleman, don't you think.
He fancies you.

61
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:37,355
Elizabeth?
How's it coming?

62
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:40,650
It's difficult to say.

63
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,361
I'm told it's the latest
fashion in London.

64
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:45,947
Well, women in London must've
learned not to breathe.

65
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:50,243
M'lord, you have a visitor.

66
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:10,972
Ah, Mr. Turner,
good to see you again.

67
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:12,474
Good day, sir.

68
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,352
I have your order.

69
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:25,945
The blade is folded steel, that's gold
filigree laid into the handle.

70
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:29,366
If I may?

71
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:34,662
Perfectly balanced. The tang is
nearly the full width of the blade.

72
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:39,876
Impressive, very impressive.

73
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:45,674
Ah, now, Commodore Norrington is
going to be very pleased with this.

74
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:48,968
Do pass my compliments
on to your Master.

75
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:52,847
I shall.

76
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:57,143
A craftsman is always pleased
to hear his work is appreciated.

77
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:02,941
- Ah, Elizabeth, you look absolutely stunning.
- Will.

78
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:05,860
So good to see you!

79
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:10,156
- I had a dream about you last night.
- About me?

80
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,575
Elizabeth, is that entirely
proper for you to...?

81
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:14,244
About the day we met,
do you remember?

82
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:16,246
How could I forget, Miss Swann?

83
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:19,249
Will, how many times must
I ask you to call me Elizabeth?

84
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:22,669
At least once more,
Miss Swann, as always.

85
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:26,381
There, see, at least the boy has
a sense of propriety.

86
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:28,967
Now, we really must be going.
Farewell.

87
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,762
Good day, Mr. Turner.

88
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:34,639
Come along.

89
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,935
Good day...

90
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:42,355
...Elizabeth.

91
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:13,530
What?

92
00:10:13,697 --> 00:10:16,199
Hold up there, you.

93
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:20,537
It's a shilling to tie up your
boat at the dock.

94
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:24,874
And I shall need to
know your name.

95
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:30,672
What d'ye say to three shillings
and we forget the name?

96
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:36,344
Welcome to Port Royal, Mr. Smith.

97
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:15,050
Two paces front!

98
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:19,679
Right about turn!

99
00:11:22,057 --> 00:11:23,600
Present...

100
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,060
...arms!

101
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,336
This dock is off limits to civilians.

102
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:54,255
I'm terribly sorry, I didn't know.
If I see one...

103
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:56,257
...I shall inform you immediately.

104
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:02,972
Apparently there's some sort of a high toned
and fancy to do up at the fort, eh?

105
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:08,770
How could it be that two upstanding gentlemen
such as yourselves did not merit an invitation?

106
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:12,148
Someone has to make sure this
dock stays off limits to civilians.

107
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:16,152
It's a fine goal to be sure but
it seems to me that a...

108
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:20,448
a ship like that makes this one
here a bit superfluous, really.

109
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:25,036
Ah, the Dauntless is the power
in these waters, true enough,

110
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:27,956
but there's no ship that can match
the Interceptor for speed.

111
00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:31,960
I've heard of one, supposed to be
very fast, nigh un-catchable...

112
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:34,754
"The Black Pearl"

113
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:40,051
Well...there's no real ship that
can match the Interceptor.

114
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:45,348
- The Black Pearl is a real ship.
- No, no it's not.

115
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:48,059
- Yes, it is, I've seen it.
- You've seen it?

116
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:51,271
- Yes.
- You haven't seen it.

117
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:52,272
Yes, I have.

118
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:56,276
You've seen a ship with black sails...

119
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:59,946
...that's crewed by the damned and
captained by a man so evil...

120
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:03,116
...that Hell itself spat him back out?

121
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:06,369
- No.
- No.

122
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:09,748
But I have seen a ship
with black sails.

123
00:13:09,748 --> 00:13:13,752
Oh, and no ship that's not crewed by
the damned and captained by a man so evil...

124
00:13:14,044 --> 00:13:16,046
...that Hell itself spat him
back out could possibly...

125
00:13:16,046 --> 00:13:18,798
...have black sails therefore couldn't
possibly be any other...

126
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:21,259
...ship than the Black Pearl.
Is that what you're saying?

127
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,970
No.

128
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:27,974
Like I said… there's no real ship
that can match the Interceptor

129
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:32,270
Hey!

130
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:35,273
You!

131
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:38,943
Get away from there! You don't
have permission to be aboard there, mate.

132
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,946
I'm sorry, it's just it's such
a pretty boat - ship.

133
00:13:42,364 --> 00:13:46,493
- What's your name?
- Smith or...Smithy, if you like.

134
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:49,662
What's your purpose in
Port Royal, Mr. Smith?

135
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,373
Yeah, and no lies!

136
00:13:51,373 --> 00:13:56,544
Well, then, I confess, it is my intention
to commandeer one of these ships.

137
00:13:56,544 --> 00:14:00,548
Pick up a crew in Tortuga, raid, pillage, plunder
and otherwise pilfer my weasely black guts out.

138
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:03,176
I said no lies.

139
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:04,344
I think he's telling the truth.

140
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:07,972
If he were telling the truth,
he wouldn't have told us.

141
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:11,935
Unless, of course, he knew you wouldn't
believe the truth even if he told it to you.

142
00:14:22,654 --> 00:14:23,655
May I have a moment?

143
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:36,835
- You look lovely, Elizabeth.
- Yes?

144
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:44,009
I apologize if I seem forward but I...
must speak my mind.

145
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:49,347
This promotion throws into sharp
relief that which I have...

146
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:55,562
...not yet achieved.
A marriage to a fine woman.

147
00:14:56,938 --> 00:15:00,275
You have become a fine
woman, Elizabeth.

148
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:01,943
I can't breathe.

149
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,155
Yes, I'm a bit nervous myself.

150
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:10,535
...and then they made me their chief.

151
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:14,372
Elizabeth?

152
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,376
Elizabeth!

153
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:22,380
The rocks!
Sir, it's a miracle she missed them!

154
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:27,344
- Will you be saving her then?
- I can't swim.

155
00:15:29,346 --> 00:15:31,848
Pearl of the Kings Navy you are.

156
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:33,350
Do not lose these.

157
00:15:48,365 --> 00:15:49,866
What was that?

158
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:33,368
I got her.

159
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:36,788
- Not breathing.
- Move!

160
00:16:43,253 --> 00:16:44,754
Never would have thought of that.

161
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:47,841
Clearly you've never been to Singapore.

162
00:16:53,263 --> 00:16:55,056
Where did you get that?

163
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:58,184
On your feet.

164
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,272
Elizabeth.

165
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:06,276
- Are you alright?
- Yes, I'm fine.

166
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,781
- Shoot him!
- Father!

167
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:15,869
Commodore, do you really
intend to kill my rescuer?

168
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,836
I believe thanks are in order.

169
00:17:28,757 --> 00:17:31,259
Had a brush with the East India
Trading company, did we?

170
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:32,844
Pirate?

171
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:35,263
Hang him.

172
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,850
Keep your guns on him, men.
Gillette, fetch some irons.

173
00:17:39,851 --> 00:17:45,523
- Well, well... Jack Sparrow, isn't it?
- Captain Jack Sparrow, if you please, sir.

174
00:17:46,274 --> 00:17:51,488
- Well, I don't see your ship...Captain.
- I'm in the market as it were.

175
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:55,325
- He said he'd come to commandeer one.
- Told ya he was telling the truth.

176
00:17:55,325 --> 00:17:57,827
These are his, sir.

177
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:03,375
No additional shots nor powder.

178
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:07,295
A compass that doesn't point north.

179
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:14,761
And I half expected it
to be made of wood.

180
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:20,225
You are, without doubt, the worst
pirate I've ever heard of.

181
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:23,228
But you have heard of me.

182
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:27,273
Commodore, I really must protest.

183
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:29,484
Carefully Lieutenant.

184
00:18:29,901 --> 00:18:31,778
Pirate or not this man saved my life.

185
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:35,532
One good deed is not enough to redeem
a man of a lifetime of wickedness.

186
00:18:35,532 --> 00:18:38,076
Though it seems enough
to condemn him.

187
00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:39,369
Indeed.

188
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:41,371
Finally.

189
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:44,290
No, don't shoot!

190
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:48,253
I knew you'd warm up to me.
Commodore Norrington, my effects, please...

191
00:18:48,253 --> 00:18:50,088
...and my hat.

192
00:18:51,256 --> 00:18:52,048
Commodore!

193
00:18:54,342 --> 00:18:58,304
- Elizabeth, it is Elizabeth isn't it?
- It's Miss Swann.

194
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:02,308
Miss Swann, if you'd be so kind.
Come, come, dear, we don't have all day.

195
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:06,855
Now if you'd be very kind.

196
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:25,373
Easy on the goods, darling.

197
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:27,876
You're despicable.

198
00:19:27,876 --> 00:19:31,838
Sticks and stones, love. I saved your
life, you saved mine, we're square.

199
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:35,800
Gentlemen, m'lady,

200
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,054
you will always remember this as
the day that you almost caught...

201
00:19:39,054 --> 00:19:41,306
...Captain Jack Sparrow.

202
00:20:00,742 --> 00:20:04,037
- Now, will you shoot him?
- Open fire!

203
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:12,462
On his heels!

204
00:20:30,855 --> 00:20:34,859
Gillette, Mr. Sparrow has a dawn
appointment with the gallows...

205
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:37,070
...I would hate for him to miss it.

206
00:20:41,449 --> 00:20:42,992
Search upstairs.

207
00:20:44,411 --> 00:20:45,370
Look lively, men.

208
00:22:18,755 --> 00:22:21,466
Right where I left you.

209
00:22:27,764 --> 00:22:28,765
Not where I left you.

210
00:22:39,651 --> 00:22:40,860
You're the one they're hunting.

211
00:22:42,654 --> 00:22:43,363
The pirate.

212
00:22:44,447 --> 00:22:47,325
You seem somewhat familiar.
Have I threatened you before?

213
00:22:47,659 --> 00:22:50,620
I make a point of avoiding
familiarity with pirates.

214
00:22:50,745 --> 00:22:54,082
Ah. Well, then it would be a shame to
put a black mark on your record.

215
00:22:54,082 --> 00:22:55,375
So, if you'll excuse me...

216
00:22:59,254 --> 00:23:01,548
Do you think this wise, boy...

217
00:23:01,548 --> 00:23:03,842
...crossing blades with a pirate?

218
00:23:05,677 --> 00:23:07,262
You threatened Miss Swann.

219
00:23:10,056 --> 00:23:12,350
Only a little.

220
00:23:24,988 --> 00:23:28,283
You know what you're doing,
I'll give you that. Excellent form...

221
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:30,869
...but how's your footwork?

222
00:23:31,703 --> 00:23:34,873
If I step here...
Very good.

223
00:23:35,957 --> 00:23:37,250
Now I step again.

224
00:23:42,756 --> 00:23:43,673
Ta.

225
00:24:03,777 --> 00:24:05,445
That is a wonderful trick.

226
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:09,866
Except once again you are
between me and my way out.

227
00:24:10,408 --> 00:24:13,244
And now you have no weapon.

228
00:24:35,767 --> 00:24:37,268
Who makes all these?

229
00:24:39,062 --> 00:24:42,273
I do!
And I practice with them...

230
00:24:42,774 --> 00:24:44,275
...three hours a day!

231
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:47,987
You need to find yourself a girl, mate.

232
00:24:55,161 --> 00:24:59,207
Or, perhaps the reason you practice three
hours a day is that you already found one...

233
00:24:59,207 --> 00:25:02,961
...and are otherwise incapable
of wooing said strumpet.

234
00:25:03,878 --> 00:25:05,547
You're not a eunuch, are you?

235
00:25:06,256 --> 00:25:08,842
I practice three hours a day,
so that when I meet a pirate...

236
00:25:08,842 --> 00:25:10,343
...I can kill it.

237
00:26:28,213 --> 00:26:28,880
You cheated!

238
00:26:29,589 --> 00:26:30,382
Pirate!

239
00:26:33,885 --> 00:26:35,887
- Move away!
- No!

240
00:26:36,388 --> 00:26:38,473
- Please, move!
- No!

241
00:26:38,473 --> 00:26:40,475
I cannot just step aside
and let you escape.

242
00:26:43,895 --> 00:26:45,897
This shot is not meant for you.

243
00:27:00,495 --> 00:27:06,001
Excellent work, Mr. Brown. You've assisted
in the capture of a dangerous fugitive.

244
00:27:06,001 --> 00:27:08,586
Just doing my civic duty, sir.

245
00:27:09,379 --> 00:27:12,173
Well, I trust you'll always remember
this as the day that Captain...

246
00:27:12,298 --> 00:27:15,468
...Jack Sparrow almost escaped.

247
00:27:15,468 --> 00:27:17,470
Take him away!

248
00:27:23,226 --> 00:27:26,187
- Can you smell it?
- Come here, boy.

249
00:27:26,271 --> 00:27:30,275
- Want a nice juicy bone?
- Come here, boy.

250
00:27:30,692 --> 00:27:34,696
You can keep doing that forever,
the dog is never going to move.

251
00:27:34,988 --> 00:27:38,992
Oh, excuse us if we haven't resigned
ourselves to the gallows just yet.

252
00:27:46,041 --> 00:27:47,751
There you go, Miss.

253
00:27:47,751 --> 00:27:49,544
It's a difficult day for you, I am sure.

254
00:27:50,503 --> 00:27:52,714
I suspected Commodore Norrington would propose but...

255
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:55,383
...I must admit I wasn't entirely prepared for it.

256
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:59,012
Well, I meant you being threatened
by that pirate, sounds terrifying.

257
00:27:59,596 --> 00:28:02,766
Oh, yes, it was terrifying.

258
00:28:02,974 --> 00:28:06,686
But the Commodore proposed.
Fancy that.

259
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:09,898
Now that's a smart match, Miss,
if it's not too bold to say.

260
00:28:10,023 --> 00:28:11,483
It is a smart match.

261
00:28:13,526 --> 00:28:14,944
He's a fine man.

262
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:18,114
The sort any woman should dream of marrying.

263
00:28:19,699 --> 00:28:23,328
Well, that Will Turner,
he's a fine man too.

264
00:28:23,703 --> 00:28:25,288
That is too bold.

265
00:28:25,705 --> 00:28:28,875
Well, begging your pardon, Miss,
it was not my place.

266
00:29:18,341 --> 00:29:22,345
- Has my daughter given you an answer yet?
- No, she hasn't.

267
00:29:24,014 --> 00:29:26,141
Well, she has had a very trying day.

268
00:29:27,851 --> 00:29:29,436
Ghastly weather, don't you think?

269
00:29:30,228 --> 00:29:31,646
Bleak, very bleak.

270
00:29:33,523 --> 00:29:34,315
What's that?

271
00:29:35,817 --> 00:29:36,651
Cannon fire!

272
00:29:39,029 --> 00:29:40,613
Return fire!

273
00:29:40,822 --> 00:29:42,323
I know those guns.

274
00:29:49,247 --> 00:29:52,250
- It's the Pearl.
- Black Pearl?

275
00:29:55,128 --> 00:29:59,549
I've heard stories. She's been preying on
ships and settlements for near ten years.

276
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:03,636
- Never leaves any survivors.
- No survivors?

277
00:30:04,512 --> 00:30:07,140
Then where do the stories
come from, I wonder?

278
00:31:46,656 --> 00:31:47,532
Governor.

279
00:31:47,949 --> 00:31:50,243
Barricade yourself in my office.

280
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,538
That's an order!

281
00:32:12,223 --> 00:32:13,016
Don't!

282
00:32:13,433 --> 00:32:14,851
Hello, chump.

283
00:32:19,147 --> 00:32:20,565
- Up there!
- Girl!

284
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:32,869
Miss Swann, they've come to kidnap you.

285
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:35,121
- What?
- You're the Governors daughter.

286
00:32:38,917 --> 00:32:42,337
They haven't seen you. Hide and the
first chance you get, run to the fort.

287
00:32:52,347 --> 00:32:53,348
Gotcha!

288
00:33:00,814 --> 00:33:03,316
- It's hot! It's on me!
- Come on.

289
00:33:46,943 --> 00:33:49,612
We know you're here, Poppet.

290
00:33:50,238 --> 00:33:51,948
Poppet.

291
00:33:51,948 --> 00:33:52,741
Come out.

292
00:33:54,034 --> 00:33:56,244
We promise we wont hurt you.

293
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:00,832
We will find you, Poppet.

294
00:34:02,417 --> 00:34:06,338
You've got something of
ours and it calls to us.

295
00:34:12,427 --> 00:34:14,846
The Gold calls to us.

296
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:18,141
Gold calls...

297
00:34:23,438 --> 00:34:25,065
'Ello, Poppet.

298
00:34:26,149 --> 00:34:28,651
- Parley!
- What?

299
00:34:28,735 --> 00:34:31,529
Parley. I invoke the right of parley.

300
00:34:32,322 --> 00:34:35,450
According to the code of the brethren, set down
by the pirates Morgan and Bartholomew...

301
00:34:35,533 --> 00:34:36,534
...you have to take me to your Captain.

302
00:34:36,951 --> 00:34:38,912
I know the code.

303
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,331
If an adversary demands parley you
can do them no harm until...

304
00:34:41,623 --> 00:34:42,540
...the parley is complete.

305
00:34:42,832 --> 00:34:44,042
To blazes with the code.

306
00:34:44,042 --> 00:34:46,127
She wants to be taken to the Captain.

307
00:34:47,837 --> 00:34:53,843
And she'll go without a fuss.
We must honor the code.

308
00:35:04,729 --> 00:35:06,314
Say goodbye!

309
00:35:10,735 --> 00:35:11,528
Goodbye.

310
00:35:16,616 --> 00:35:17,951
- Come on!
- Elizabeth.

311
00:35:27,419 --> 00:35:28,920
Outta my way, scum!

312
00:35:41,683 --> 00:35:44,978
My sympathies friend, you've
no manner of luck at all.

313
00:36:07,125 --> 00:36:08,626
Come on, doggy.

314
00:36:08,793 --> 00:36:12,547
It's just you and me now.
It's you and ol' Jack, come on.

315
00:36:12,922 --> 00:36:18,720
Come on, good boy.
That’s it, good boy, come on!

316
00:36:18,762 --> 00:36:20,430
Bit closer, bit closer.

317
00:36:20,638 --> 00:36:23,516
That's it, that's it, doggy.

318
00:36:23,558 --> 00:36:26,561
Come on you filthy, slimy, mangy cad.

319
00:36:28,229 --> 00:36:30,607
No, no, no, no, no,
I didn't mean it. I didn't...

320
00:36:38,156 --> 00:36:39,699
This ain't the armory.

321
00:36:40,658 --> 00:36:44,662
Well, well, well,
look what we have here Twigg?

322
00:36:45,455 --> 00:36:47,374
Captain Jack Sparrow.

323
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:55,173
Last time I saw you, you were all
alone on a godforsaken island.

324
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:59,636
Shrinking into the distance.
His fortunes aren't improved much.

325
00:37:00,387 --> 00:37:03,431
Worry about your own
fortunes, gentlemen.

326
00:37:04,099 --> 00:37:08,103
The deepest circle of Hell is reserved
for betrayers and mutineers.

327
00:37:12,524 --> 00:37:13,942
So there is a curse.

328
00:37:16,194 --> 00:37:17,237
That's interesting.

329
00:37:17,612 --> 00:37:19,531
You know nothing of Hell.

330
00:37:28,206 --> 00:37:30,125
That's very interesting.

331
00:38:05,994 --> 00:38:08,121
I didn't know we were
takin' on captives.

332
00:38:08,329 --> 00:38:11,416
She's invoked the right of parley
with Captain Barbossa.

333
00:38:11,708 --> 00:38:15,086
- I am here to negotiate...
- You will speak when spoken to.

334
00:38:16,379 --> 00:38:20,342
And ye'll not lay a hand on those
under the protection of parley.

335
00:38:21,217 --> 00:38:22,927
Aye, sir.

336
00:38:25,513 --> 00:38:26,431
My apologies, Miss.

337
00:38:28,516 --> 00:38:32,937
Captain Barbossa, I am here to negotiate
the cessation of hostilities...

338
00:38:33,063 --> 00:38:34,397
...against Port Royal.

339
00:38:34,898 --> 00:38:38,943
There are a lot of long words in there, Miss,
we're naught but humble pirates.

340
00:38:40,153 --> 00:38:44,157
- What is it that you want?
- I want you to leave and never come back.

341
00:38:47,035 --> 00:38:50,163
I'm disinclined to acquiesce to your request...

342
00:38:51,748 --> 00:38:53,083
...means no.

343
00:38:54,709 --> 00:38:56,670
Very well.

344
00:38:58,546 --> 00:38:59,339
I'll drop it.

345
00:39:04,344 --> 00:39:08,431
Me holds are burstin' with swag and
that bit of shine matters to us?

346
00:39:09,307 --> 00:39:12,811
- Why?
- It's what you've been searching for.

347
00:39:14,229 --> 00:39:17,649
I recognized the ship. I saw it eight years
ago on the crossing from England.

348
00:39:17,941 --> 00:39:19,234
Did ya now?

349
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:23,947
Fine.

350
00:39:23,947 --> 00:39:28,076
Well, I suppose if it is worthless then
there's no point in me keeping it.

351
00:39:40,046 --> 00:39:42,173
You have a name, Missy?

352
00:39:43,049 --> 00:39:45,677
Elizabeth... Turner.

353
00:39:47,512 --> 00:39:49,389
I'm a maid in the
Governors household.

354
00:39:52,726 --> 00:39:53,768
Miss Turner...?

355
00:39:56,646 --> 00:39:57,439
Bootstrap.

356
00:40:01,901 --> 00:40:04,446
And how does a maid come to
own a trinket such as that?

357
00:40:04,487 --> 00:40:06,823
Family heirloom, perhaps?

358
00:40:08,116 --> 00:40:11,119
I didn't steal it if that's what you mean.

359
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:15,582
Very well, you hand it over and we'll put your
town to our rudder and never return.

360
00:40:29,512 --> 00:40:30,805
Our bargain?

361
00:40:33,683 --> 00:40:37,103
Still the guns and stow 'em, signal the men, set the flags...

362
00:40:37,103 --> 00:40:39,856
Wait! You have to take me to shore.

363
00:40:40,231 --> 00:40:42,108
According to the code of the order of the brethren...

364
00:40:42,108 --> 00:40:45,528
First, your return to shore was
not part of our negotiations...

365
00:40:45,528 --> 00:40:47,238
...nor our agreement so
I must do nothing.

366
00:40:47,655 --> 00:40:51,159
And secondly, you must be a pirate for
the pirates code to apply and you're not

367
00:40:51,576 --> 00:40:56,623
And thirdly, the code is more what you'd
call "guidelines" than actual rules.

368
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:00,710
Welcome aboard the Black Pearl,
Miss Turner.

369
00:41:21,481 --> 00:41:23,441
They've taken her.
They've taken Elizabeth.

370
00:41:23,983 --> 00:41:26,319
Mr. Murtogg, remove this man.

371
00:41:27,153 --> 00:41:29,447
We have to hunt them down,
we must save her.

372
00:41:29,864 --> 00:41:31,449
And where do you propose we start?

373
00:41:32,492 --> 00:41:36,079
If you have any information concerning
my daughter, please, share it.

374
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:42,502
That Jack Sparrow.
He talked about the Black Pearl.

375
00:41:42,502 --> 00:41:44,963
Mentioned it, is more what he did.

376
00:41:46,172 --> 00:41:47,215
Ask him where it is.

377
00:41:47,674 --> 00:41:49,509
Make a deal with him
he could lead us to it.

378
00:41:49,509 --> 00:41:51,344
No...

379
00:41:51,344 --> 00:41:55,181
the pirates who invaded this Fort left
Sparrow locked in his cell ergo....

380
00:41:55,181 --> 00:41:56,599
...they are not his allies.

381
00:41:57,017 --> 00:41:59,853
Governor, we will establish
their most likely course...

382
00:42:00,979 --> 00:42:01,938
That's not good enough!

383
00:42:02,981 --> 00:42:07,318
Mr. Turner, you are not a military
man, you are not a sailor.

384
00:42:09,237 --> 00:42:13,158
You are a blacksmith and this is
not the moment for rash actions.

385
00:42:15,702 --> 00:42:18,455
Do not make the mistake of thinking
you are the only man here...

386
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:19,748
...who cares for Elizabeth.

387
00:42:32,385 --> 00:42:34,512
- You, Sparrow!
- Aye.

388
00:42:34,512 --> 00:42:36,222
You are familiar with that ship,
the Black Pearl?

389
00:42:37,766 --> 00:42:39,684
- I've heard of it.
- Where does it make berth?

390
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:43,355
Where does it make berth?
Have you not heard the stories?

391
00:42:46,107 --> 00:42:52,906
Captain Barbossa and his crew of miscreants
sailed from the dreaded Isla de Muerta.

392
00:42:52,906 --> 00:42:57,869
It's an island that cannot be found except
by those who already know where it is.

393
00:42:58,870 --> 00:43:00,080
The ships real enough.

394
00:43:01,122 --> 00:43:03,583
Therefore it's anchorage must be
a real place. Where is it?

395
00:43:04,626 --> 00:43:07,754
- Why ask me?
- Because you're a pirate.

396
00:43:08,004 --> 00:43:10,465
And you want to turn pirate
yourself, is that it?

397
00:43:12,425 --> 00:43:13,343
Never.

398
00:43:16,721 --> 00:43:20,433
- They took Miss Swann.
- Oh, so it is that you've found a girl.

399
00:43:20,642 --> 00:43:22,102
I see.

400
00:43:22,102 --> 00:43:27,816
Well, if you're intending to brave all, hasten
to her rescue and so win fair lady's heart...

401
00:43:27,816 --> 00:43:31,945
...you'll have to do it alone, mate.
I see no profit in it for me.

402
00:43:33,029 --> 00:43:36,157
- I can get you out of here.
- How's that? The keys run off.

403
00:43:36,408 --> 00:43:39,828
I helped build these cells.
These are half pin-barrel hinges.

404
00:43:41,746 --> 00:43:44,499
With the right leverage and
a proper application of strength...

405
00:43:46,292 --> 00:43:47,377
...the door will lift free.

406
00:43:49,963 --> 00:43:53,216
- What's your name?
- Will Turner.

407
00:43:54,634 --> 00:43:56,511
That will be short for William,
I imagine.

408
00:43:56,928 --> 00:44:01,057
Good, strong name. No doubt,
named for your father, aye?

409
00:44:03,018 --> 00:44:04,227
Yes.

410
00:44:06,813 --> 00:44:09,441
Well, Mr. Turner,
I've changed me mind.

411
00:44:10,316 --> 00:44:13,069
If you spring me from this cell,
I swear on pain of death...

412
00:44:13,069 --> 00:44:17,073
...I shall take you to the Black
Pearl and your bonny lass.

413
00:44:17,490 --> 00:44:18,992
Do we have an accord?

414
00:44:22,996 --> 00:44:25,582
- Agreed.
- Agreed, get me out.

415
00:44:29,586 --> 00:44:30,795
Hurry, someone will
have heard that.

416
00:44:31,004 --> 00:44:32,630
Not without my effects.

417
00:44:39,721 --> 00:44:40,930
We're going to steal a ship?

418
00:44:43,308 --> 00:44:43,850
That ship?

419
00:44:44,059 --> 00:44:48,188
Commandeer.
We're going to commandeer that ship.

420
00:44:48,229 --> 00:44:49,439
Nautical term.

421
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:53,276
One question about your business boy,
or there's no use going.

422
00:44:53,735 --> 00:44:57,739
This girl, how far are you
willing to go to save her?

423
00:44:58,281 --> 00:45:00,367
- I'd die for her.
- Oh, good.

424
00:45:00,533 --> 00:45:02,077
No worries, then.

425
00:45:21,888 --> 00:45:24,349
This is either madness or brilliance.

426
00:45:25,016 --> 00:45:28,353
It's remarkable how often
those two traits coincide.

427
00:45:58,425 --> 00:46:01,886
Everyone stay calm,
we are taking over the ship.

428
00:46:01,886 --> 00:46:04,014
Aye, avast!

429
00:46:07,308 --> 00:46:09,227
This ship cannot be crewed by two men.

430
00:46:10,437 --> 00:46:11,813
You'll never make it out of the bay.

431
00:46:13,023 --> 00:46:14,107
Son.

432
00:46:14,941 --> 00:46:18,945
I'm Captain Jack Sparrow, savvy?

433
00:46:22,615 --> 00:46:23,658
Commodore!

434
00:46:23,658 --> 00:46:27,620
Sir, they've taken the Dauntless!

435
00:46:30,206 --> 00:46:31,458
They've taken the ship.

436
00:46:32,417 --> 00:46:35,128
Sparrow and Turner,
they've taken the Dauntless!

437
00:46:35,128 --> 00:46:38,006
Rash, Turner, too rash.

438
00:46:39,758 --> 00:46:43,386
He is without doubt the worst
pirate I have ever seen.

439
00:46:47,182 --> 00:46:47,974
Here they come.

440
00:46:53,271 --> 00:46:56,066
Bring her around!
Bring her around!

441
00:47:02,447 --> 00:47:05,283
Search every cabin, every hold,
down to the bilges.

442
00:47:21,383 --> 00:47:24,344
- Sailors, back to the Interceptor! Now!
- Quickly men!

443
00:47:30,767 --> 00:47:34,062
Thank you, Commodore, for
getting us ready to make way.

444
00:47:34,354 --> 00:47:36,773
We'd have a hard time
of it by ourselves.

445
00:47:40,485 --> 00:47:42,153
Set top sails and clear up this mess.

446
00:47:42,654 --> 00:47:44,781
With the wind a quarter astern,
we wont catch them.

447
00:47:44,781 --> 00:47:47,283
We don't need to catch them just
get them in range of the long nines.

448
00:47:47,283 --> 00:47:50,370
Men, come about.
Run out the guns.

449
00:47:51,246 --> 00:47:53,456
We open fire on our own ship, sir?

450
00:47:54,165 --> 00:47:57,460
I'd rather see her at the bottom of the
ocean than in the hands of a pirate.

451
00:47:59,295 --> 00:48:02,674
Commodore, he's disabled
the rudder chain, sir.

452
00:48:06,469 --> 00:48:07,554
Abandon ship!

453
00:48:14,769 --> 00:48:17,147
That's got to be the best
pirate I've ever seen.

454
00:48:18,273 --> 00:48:20,275
So it would seem.

455
00:48:29,451 --> 00:48:33,079
When I was a lad living in England,
my mother raised me by herself.

456
00:48:33,246 --> 00:48:37,250
After she died, I came out here,
looking for my father.

457
00:48:38,877 --> 00:48:39,669
Is that so?

458
00:48:41,755 --> 00:48:43,882
My father, Will Turner.

459
00:48:44,299 --> 00:48:47,969
And in jail it was only after you learned
my name that you agreed to help.

460
00:48:47,969 --> 00:48:49,846
Since that's what I wanted,
I didn't press the matter.

461
00:48:50,472 --> 00:48:53,975
I'm not a simpleton, Jack.
You knew my father.

462
00:49:00,190 --> 00:49:01,483
I knew 'im.

463
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:04,611
Probably one the few who knew
him as William Turner.

464
00:49:05,028 --> 00:49:08,073
Everyone else just called him
Bootstrap or Bootstrap Bill.

465
00:49:08,073 --> 00:49:12,077
- Bootstrap?
- Good man, good pirate.

466
00:49:12,619 --> 00:49:15,872
- I swear you look just like him.
- It's not true.

467
00:49:16,289 --> 00:49:19,876
He was a merchant sailor, a good,
respectable man who obeyed the law.

468
00:49:20,502 --> 00:49:22,712
He was a bloody pirate, a scallywag.

469
00:49:23,755 --> 00:49:26,675
My father was not a pirate.

470
00:49:27,592 --> 00:49:29,386
Put it away, son.

471
00:49:30,303 --> 00:49:31,888
It's not worth you getting beat again.

472
00:49:31,971 --> 00:49:33,306
You didn't beat me.

473
00:49:33,306 --> 00:49:36,309
You ignored the rules of engagement.
In a fair fight. I'd killed you.

474
00:49:36,476 --> 00:49:39,104
And that's no incentive for
me to fight fair, is it?

475
00:49:46,611 --> 00:49:49,197
Now as long as you're just
hanging there, pay attention.

476
00:49:50,198 --> 00:49:52,909
The only rules that really
matter are these:

477
00:49:52,909 --> 00:49:56,579
What a man can do and
what a man can't do.

478
00:49:56,579 --> 00:50:01,376
For instance you can accept that your
father was a pirate and a good man...

479
00:50:01,376 --> 00:50:02,585
...or you can't.

480
00:50:02,877 --> 00:50:06,798
But pirate is in your blood, boy, so you'll
have to square with that someday.

481
00:50:07,007 --> 00:50:09,801
And me, for example,
I can let you drown.

482
00:50:10,301 --> 00:50:13,888
But I can't bring this ship into Tortuga
all by me onesies, savvy?

483
00:50:13,972 --> 00:50:15,682
So...

484
00:50:19,894 --> 00:50:23,273
Can you sail under the
command of a pirate...

485
00:50:23,273 --> 00:50:25,900
...or can you not?

486
00:50:28,403 --> 00:50:29,612
Tortuga?

487
00:50:30,405 --> 00:50:31,573
Tortuga.

488
00:50:54,429 --> 00:50:57,891
More importantly, it is indeed a sad life
that has never breathed deep

489
00:50:57,932 --> 00:51:00,977
the sweet proliferous bouquet that is Tortuga, savvy?

490
00:51:02,729 --> 00:51:03,813
What do you think?

491
00:51:08,401 --> 00:51:09,277
It'll linger.

492
00:51:09,861 --> 00:51:11,112
I'll tell you mate.

493
00:51:11,279 --> 00:51:13,656
If every town in the world were like this one...

494
00:51:13,656 --> 00:51:16,326
...no man would ever feel unwanted.

495
00:51:18,078 --> 00:51:19,037
Scarlett!

496
00:51:21,206 --> 00:51:23,917
Not sure I deserved that.

497
00:51:23,917 --> 00:51:25,335
Giselle!

498
00:51:25,335 --> 00:51:26,711
Who was she?

499
00:51:26,711 --> 00:51:27,504
What?

500
00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:31,132
I may have deserved that.

501
00:51:33,426 --> 00:51:35,637
Curse you for breathing,
you slack jawed idiot!

502
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:40,642
Mother's love!

503
00:51:40,642 --> 00:51:42,102
Jack!

504
00:51:42,602 --> 00:51:45,814
You should know better then to wake
a man when he's sleeping.

505
00:51:45,814 --> 00:51:49,109
- It's bad luck
- Ah, fortunately I know how to counter it.

506
00:51:49,901 --> 00:51:53,321
The man who did the waking buys,
the man who was sleeping, a drink.

507
00:51:53,405 --> 00:51:56,116
The man who was sleeping drinks it
while listening to a proposition...

508
00:51:56,324 --> 00:51:57,325
... from the man who did the waking.

509
00:52:00,829 --> 00:52:02,330
Aye, that'll about do it.

510
00:52:07,627 --> 00:52:08,920
Blast! I'm already awake!

511
00:52:10,213 --> 00:52:12,215
That was for the smell.

512
00:52:21,933 --> 00:52:23,518
Keep a sharp eye!

513
00:52:30,817 --> 00:52:34,237
Now, what's the nature of
this venture you are in?

514
00:52:35,822 --> 00:52:37,741
I'm going after the Black Pearl.

515
00:52:41,828 --> 00:52:45,040
I know where it's going to be
and I'm going to take it.

516
00:52:46,332 --> 00:52:49,002
Jack, it's a fool's errand.

517
00:52:49,627 --> 00:52:52,005
Well, you know better than me
the tales of the Black Pearl.

518
00:52:52,922 --> 00:52:55,508
That's why I know what
Barbossa is up to...

519
00:52:56,009 --> 00:52:57,635
...all I need is a crew.

520
00:52:58,219 --> 00:53:00,138
From what I hear tell of Captain Barbossa,

521
00:53:00,138 --> 00:53:02,974
he's not a man to suffer fools
nor strike a bargain with one.

522
00:53:03,141 --> 00:53:05,435
Well, then I say it's a very good
thing I'm not a fool then, aye?

523
00:53:05,518 --> 00:53:09,522
Prove me wrong. What makes ye think
Barbossa will give up his ship to you?

524
00:53:10,523 --> 00:53:13,902
Let's just say it's a matter of leverage, aye?

525
00:53:30,335 --> 00:53:31,211
The kid?

526
00:53:32,837 --> 00:53:35,924
That is the child of Bootstrap Bill Turner.

527
00:53:36,716 --> 00:53:39,302
His only child, savvy?

528
00:53:39,928 --> 00:53:41,429
Is he now?

529
00:53:44,307 --> 00:53:46,601
Leverage says you...

530
00:53:46,601 --> 00:53:51,022
...I think I feel a change in the wind says I.
I'll find us a crew...

531
00:53:51,523 --> 00:53:54,609
...there's bound to be some sailors
on this rock crazy as you.

532
00:53:54,734 --> 00:53:57,737
One can only hope.
Take what you can...

533
00:53:57,821 --> 00:53:59,239
Give nothing back.

534
00:54:24,431 --> 00:54:28,101
You'll be dinin' with the captain.
And he requests you wear this.

535
00:54:29,519 --> 00:54:32,939
Well, you may tell the captain that I am
disinclined to acquiesce to his request.

536
00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:35,442
He said you'd say that.

537
00:54:36,401 --> 00:54:38,737
He also said if that be the case...

538
00:54:38,903 --> 00:54:40,613
...you'll be dinin' with the crew...

539
00:54:41,031 --> 00:54:42,615
...and you'll be naked.

540
00:54:48,621 --> 00:54:49,539
Fine.

541
00:55:06,723 --> 00:55:10,226
There's no need to stand on ceremony,
nor call to impress anyone.

542
00:55:11,519 --> 00:55:13,521
You must be hungry.

543
00:55:30,330 --> 00:55:31,331
Try the wine.

544
00:55:36,503 --> 00:55:38,505
And the apples?
One of those next.

545
00:55:47,639 --> 00:55:48,431
It's poisoned.

546
00:55:50,809 --> 00:55:53,228
There would be no sense to
be killing ye Miss Turner.

547
00:55:53,228 --> 00:55:56,231
Then release me, you have your trinket.
I'm of no further value to you.

548
00:56:00,735 --> 00:56:05,615
- You don't know what this is, do ye?
- It's a pirate medallion.

549
00:56:06,324 --> 00:56:08,618
This is Aztec gold.

550
00:56:09,411 --> 00:56:15,417
One of 882 identical pieces they delivered
in a stone chest to Cortés himself.

551
00:56:17,002 --> 00:56:21,006
Blood money paid to stem the slaughter
he wreaked upon them with his armies.

552
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:25,218
But the greed of Cortés was insatiable.

553
00:56:25,301 --> 00:56:32,017
So the heathen gods placed upon
the gold…a terrible curse.

554
00:56:33,601 --> 00:56:37,605
Any mortal that removes but
a piece from that stone chest...

555
00:56:38,815 --> 00:56:41,609
...shall be punished for eternity.

556
00:56:44,112 --> 00:56:47,115
I hardly believe in ghost stories
anymore, Captain Barbossa.

557
00:56:47,323 --> 00:56:48,116
Aye.

558
00:56:49,534 --> 00:56:53,038
That's exactly what I thought when
we were first told the tale.

559
00:56:53,038 --> 00:56:56,041
Buried on an island that
cannot be found except...

560
00:56:56,124 --> 00:56:57,625
...for those who know where it is.

561
00:56:59,419 --> 00:57:03,423
Find it, we did.
There be the chest...

562
00:57:04,215 --> 00:57:06,426
...inside be the gold.

563
00:57:06,801 --> 00:57:08,428
We took them all!

564
00:57:09,429 --> 00:57:10,930
Spent them and traded them.

565
00:57:11,431 --> 00:57:15,101
We frittered them away...on drink
and food and pleasurable company.

566
00:57:16,019 --> 00:57:20,023
The more we gave them away,
the more we came to realize...

567
00:57:21,816 --> 00:57:28,740
...the drink would not satisfy,
food turned to ash in our mouths...

568
00:57:28,740 --> 00:57:32,702
...and all the pleasurable company in
the world could not slake our lust.

569
00:57:35,205 --> 00:57:38,041
We are cursed men, Miss Turner.

570
00:57:39,626 --> 00:57:46,800
Compelled by greed we were,
and now we are consumed by it.

571
00:57:57,435 --> 00:58:00,230
There is one way we
can end our curse.

572
00:58:03,942 --> 00:58:07,946
All the scattered pieces of the
Aztec gold must be restored...

573
00:58:08,822 --> 00:58:11,241
...and the blood repaid.

574
00:58:13,618 --> 00:58:17,122
Thanks to you we have the final piece.

575
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:21,418
And the blood to be repaid?

576
00:58:21,501 --> 00:58:24,004
That's why there's no sense
to be killing you...

577
00:58:24,838 --> 00:58:25,630
yet!

578
00:58:28,341 --> 00:58:29,300
Apple?

579
00:58:46,317 --> 00:58:50,655
I'm curious, after killing me what is
it you are planning on doing next?

580
00:59:55,053 --> 00:59:56,137
Look!

581
00:59:56,137 --> 00:59:59,557
The moonlight shows us
for what we really are.

582
01:00:00,058 --> 01:00:03,019
We are not among the living
and so we cannot die.

583
01:00:03,228 --> 01:00:04,938
But neither are we dead.

584
01:00:06,523 --> 01:00:09,526
For too long I've been parched with
thirst and unable to quench it.

585
01:00:09,734 --> 01:00:13,738
Too long I've been starving
to death and haven't died.

586
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:21,538
I feel nothing, not the wind on my
face nor the spray of the sea.

587
01:00:21,538 --> 01:00:24,624
Nor the warmth of a woman's flesh.

588
01:00:25,625 --> 01:00:28,753
You best start believing in
ghost stories Miss Turner...

589
01:00:29,421 --> 01:00:31,631
you're in one!

590
01:00:49,524 --> 01:00:52,318
What are ye looking at?
Back to work!

591
01:01:01,244 --> 01:01:02,245
Feast your eyes, Captain.

592
01:01:02,746 --> 01:01:05,040
All of them, faithful hands before the mast.

593
01:01:05,457 --> 01:01:07,625
Every man worth his salt.

594
01:01:08,626 --> 01:01:10,128
And crazy to boot.

595
01:01:11,046 --> 01:01:13,631
So this is your able-bodied crew?

596
01:01:19,929 --> 01:01:23,141
- You, sailor! - Cotton, Sir.
- Mr. Cotton!

597
01:01:23,850 --> 01:01:25,769
Do you have the courage and fortitude to follow orders

598
01:01:25,769 --> 01:01:28,688
and stay true in the face of danger and almost certain death?

599
01:01:29,522 --> 01:01:31,524
- Mr. Cotton! Answer man!

600
01:01:32,150 --> 01:01:36,988
He's a mute, sir. Poor devil had his tongue cut
out, so he trained the parrot to talk for him.

601
01:01:37,739 --> 01:01:39,240
No one's yet figured how.

602
01:01:42,327 --> 01:01:45,955
Mr. Cotton's... parrot.
Same question.

603
01:01:46,539 --> 01:01:49,042
Wind in the sails!
Wind in the sails!

604
01:01:50,627 --> 01:01:54,631
- Mostly, we figure, that means "yes".
- O'course it does. Satisfied?

605
01:01:56,132 --> 01:01:57,634
Well, you've proved they're mad.

606
01:01:58,426 --> 01:02:00,053
And what's the benefit for us?

607
01:02:10,730 --> 01:02:11,940
Anamaria.

608
01:02:14,025 --> 01:02:17,320
- I suppose you didn't deserve that one either?
- No, that one I deserved.

609
01:02:17,946 --> 01:02:20,740
- You stole my boat!
- Actually...

610
01:02:23,034 --> 01:02:25,120
Borrowed, borrowed without permission.

611
01:02:25,829 --> 01:02:29,332
- But with every intention of bringing it back to you.
- But you didn't!

612
01:02:29,958 --> 01:02:33,253
- You'll get another one
- I will.

613
01:02:33,545 --> 01:02:35,839
- A better one.
- A better one!

614
01:02:36,631 --> 01:02:38,341
- That one!
- What one?

615
01:02:41,344 --> 01:02:42,595
That one?

616
01:02:45,557 --> 01:02:47,434
Aye! That one.

617
01:02:47,726 --> 01:02:50,020
- What say you?
- Aye!

618
01:02:52,647 --> 01:02:56,401
No, no, no, no, no, it's frightful bad
luck to bring a woman aboard, sir.

619
01:02:56,776 --> 01:03:00,196
It'd be far worse not to, however.

620
01:03:33,146 --> 01:03:35,857
How can we sail to an island
that nobody can find...

621
01:03:36,441 --> 01:03:38,318
...with a compass that doesn't work?

622
01:03:38,485 --> 01:03:40,570
Aye, the compass doesn't point north...

623
01:03:40,945 --> 01:03:43,031
...but we're not trying to find north, are we?

624
01:03:54,459 --> 01:03:58,421
- We should drop canvas, sir.
- She can hold a bit longer.

625
01:04:01,257 --> 01:04:04,135
What's in your head that's put you
in such a fine mood, Captain?

626
01:04:04,260 --> 01:04:06,262
We're catching up.

627
01:04:21,569 --> 01:04:23,363
Time to go, Poppet!

628
01:05:19,127 --> 01:05:23,131
Dead men tell no tales.

629
01:05:25,967 --> 01:05:29,971
Puts a chill in the bones how many honest
sailors have been claimed by this passage.

630
01:05:46,237 --> 01:05:47,947
How is it that Jack came by that compass?

631
01:05:48,198 --> 01:05:51,618
Not a lot known about Jack Sparrow
before he showed up in Tortuga...

632
01:05:51,659 --> 01:05:53,620
...with a mind to go after the treasure
of the Isla de Muerta.

633
01:05:54,371 --> 01:05:56,164
That was before I met him.

634
01:05:56,164 --> 01:05:58,667
Back when he was Captain of the Black Pearl.

635
01:05:58,958 --> 01:06:00,251
What?

636
01:06:03,755 --> 01:06:05,465
He failed to mention that.

637
01:06:05,465 --> 01:06:09,052
Well, he plays things close to the vest now.
And a hard learned lesson it was.

638
01:06:09,636 --> 01:06:12,681
See three days out on the venture the
first mate comes to him and says...

639
01:06:12,681 --> 01:06:16,351
...everything's an equal share as should
be the location of the treasure too.

640
01:06:16,643 --> 01:06:21,481
So, Jack gives up the bearings.
That night there was a mutiny.

641
01:06:22,565 --> 01:06:25,485
They marooned Jack on an
island and left him to die.

642
01:06:25,652 --> 01:06:27,946
But not before he'd gone
mad with the heat.

643
01:06:31,825 --> 01:06:34,035
So that's the reason for all the...

644
01:06:36,871 --> 01:06:38,456
Reason's got nothing to do with it.

645
01:06:39,374 --> 01:06:43,378
Now Will, when a pirate is marooned
he is a given a pistol with a single shot.

646
01:06:43,461 --> 01:06:44,713
One shot.

647
01:06:44,754 --> 01:06:47,173
Well it won't do much good
hunting or to be rescued.

648
01:06:47,757 --> 01:06:51,970
But after three weeks of starvin'
belly and thirst that pistol...

649
01:06:51,970 --> 01:06:54,764
...starts to look real friendly.

650
01:06:54,764 --> 01:06:58,268
But Jack, he escaped the island
and he still has that single shot.

651
01:06:58,351 --> 01:07:03,648
Oh, but he won't use it though, save for
one man. His mutinous first mate.

652
01:07:04,065 --> 01:07:05,859
- Barbossa.
- Aye.

653
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:09,946
- How did Jack get off the island?
- Well, I'll tell you.

654
01:07:10,447 --> 01:07:14,451
He waded out into the shallows and
he waited there three days and three nights...

655
01:07:14,951 --> 01:07:18,955
till all manner of sea creature came
and acclimated to his presence.

656
01:07:19,247 --> 01:07:21,249
And on the fourth morning...

657
01:07:21,458 --> 01:07:25,462
he roped himself a couple of sea turtles,
rushed them together and made a raft!

658
01:07:27,839 --> 01:07:31,676
- He roped a couple of sea turtles?
- Aye, sea turtles.

659
01:07:33,636 --> 01:07:35,472
What did he use for rope?

660
01:07:41,144 --> 01:07:43,646
Human hair...

661
01:07:43,646 --> 01:07:45,357
...from my back.

662
01:07:46,066 --> 01:07:47,567
Let go of the anchor!

663
01:07:47,567 --> 01:07:49,944
Let go of the anchor, sir.

664
01:07:49,944 --> 01:07:52,072
Young Mr. Turner and
I are to go ashore.

665
01:07:52,864 --> 01:07:55,450
Captain! What if the worst should happen?

666
01:07:56,368 --> 01:07:59,371
- Keep to the code.
- Aye, the code.

667
01:08:26,356 --> 01:08:30,777
- Ten years of hoarding swag.
- And now we're finally getting to spend it.

668
01:08:37,951 --> 01:08:40,370
Once we're quit of the
curse we'll be rich men.

669
01:08:41,538 --> 01:08:45,041
And you can buy an eye that actually
fits and is made of glass.

670
01:08:45,166 --> 01:08:47,544
This one does splinter
something terrible.

671
01:08:49,337 --> 01:08:50,547
Stop rubbing it.

672
01:09:10,567 --> 01:09:13,236
What code is Gibbs to keep to
if the worst should happen?

673
01:09:13,695 --> 01:09:19,159
Pirate's code.
Any man who falls behind is left behind.

674
01:09:20,869 --> 01:09:23,079
No heroes amongst thieves, eh?

675
01:09:24,289 --> 01:09:29,127
You know for having such a bleak outlook on
pirates you're well on your way to becoming one.

676
01:09:30,754 --> 01:09:34,883
Sprung a man from jail, commandeered
a ship of the Fleet...

677
01:09:35,091 --> 01:09:38,345
sailed with a buccaneer crew out of Tortuga.

678
01:09:40,472 --> 01:09:42,640
And you're completely
obsessed with treasure.

679
01:09:46,561 --> 01:09:50,273
That's not true. I'm not
obsessed with treasure.

680
01:09:57,238 --> 01:10:00,075
Not all treasure is silver and gold, mate.

681
01:10:00,283 --> 01:10:02,243
Gentlemen, the time has come!

682
01:10:03,370 --> 01:10:05,747
Salvation is nigh!

683
01:10:06,581 --> 01:10:10,168
- Our torment is near at end!
- Elizabeth.

684
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:15,215
For ten years we've been tested and
tried and each man-jack of you here...

685
01:10:15,215 --> 01:10:20,970
has proved his mettle a hundred times
over and a hundred times again!

686
01:10:22,931 --> 01:10:24,974
Suffered I have.

687
01:10:25,350 --> 01:10:31,856
Punished we were. The lot of us
disproportionate to our crime.

688
01:10:33,942 --> 01:10:34,859
Here it is!

689
01:10:38,863 --> 01:10:41,741
The cursed treasure of Cortés himself.

690
01:10:44,452 --> 01:10:48,164
Every last piece that went
astray we have returned...

691
01:10:48,164 --> 01:10:51,042
save for this.

692
01:10:51,042 --> 01:10:52,544
- Jack!
- Not yet.

693
01:10:54,838 --> 01:10:56,840
We wait for the opportune moment.

694
01:11:00,135 --> 01:11:01,052
When's that?

695
01:11:02,053 --> 01:11:03,763
When it's of greatest profit to you?

696
01:11:05,098 --> 01:11:06,599
May I ask you something?

697
01:11:07,684 --> 01:11:10,061
Have I ever given you reason
not to trust me?

698
01:11:11,271 --> 01:11:16,067
Do us a favor, I know it's difficult
for you but please stay here...

699
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:19,237
and try not to do anything stupid.

700
01:11:22,949 --> 01:11:26,953
And who among us has paid the blood
sacrifice owed to the heathen gods?

701
01:11:26,953 --> 01:11:30,832
- Us!
- And whose blood must yet to be paid?

702
01:11:30,915 --> 01:11:32,250
Hers!

703
01:11:34,836 --> 01:11:38,882
You know the first thing I'm goin'
to do after the curse is lifted...

704
01:11:41,634 --> 01:11:44,054
...eat a whole bushel of apples.

705
01:11:52,896 --> 01:11:56,316
Begun by blood, by blood undone.

706
01:12:01,446 --> 01:12:04,115
Sorry, Jack, I'm not going
to be your leverage.

707
01:12:14,459 --> 01:12:15,710
That's it?

708
01:12:16,544 --> 01:12:17,921
Waste not.

709
01:12:56,126 --> 01:12:57,460
Did it work?

710
01:12:58,253 --> 01:12:59,254
I don't feel no different.

711
01:12:59,254 --> 01:13:00,547
How do we tell?

712
01:13:06,928 --> 01:13:08,847
You're not dead.

713
01:13:10,056 --> 01:13:11,016
No.

714
01:13:12,559 --> 01:13:15,353
- He shot me!
- It didn't work.

715
01:13:15,562 --> 01:13:17,814
- The curse is still upon us!
- Yes!

716
01:13:22,485 --> 01:13:26,906
You, maid! Your father, what was his name?
Was your father William Turner?

717
01:13:27,532 --> 01:13:30,285
- No.
- Where's his child?

718
01:13:30,702 --> 01:13:32,996
The child that sailed from
England eight years ago?

719
01:13:32,996 --> 01:13:35,665
The child in whose veins flows
the blood of William Turner?

720
01:13:35,665 --> 01:13:37,167
Where?

721
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:47,302
You two. You brought us the wrong person!

722
01:13:48,887 --> 01:13:53,099
No! She had the medallion,
she's the proper age.

723
01:13:53,099 --> 01:13:56,144
She said her name was
Turner, you heard her!

724
01:13:57,604 --> 01:13:58,730
Stupid blighter.

725
01:14:02,108 --> 01:14:03,777
You brought us here for nothing!

726
01:14:04,194 --> 01:14:08,114
I won't take questions and no second guesses,
not from the likes of you, Master Twigg.

727
01:14:08,198 --> 01:14:12,243
Who's to blame? Every decision you've
made has led us from bad to worse.

728
01:14:14,621 --> 01:14:17,290
It was you who sent Bootstrap to the depths!

729
01:14:21,252 --> 01:14:23,838
And it's you who brought us here in the first place!

730
01:14:25,215 --> 01:14:28,385
Any coward here dare challenge me,
let him speak!

731
01:14:30,303 --> 01:14:34,015
I say, we cut her throat
and spill all her blood.

732
01:14:34,015 --> 01:14:36,351
- Just in case.
- Yeah!

733
01:14:45,485 --> 01:14:49,406
The medallion! She's taken it!
Well, after her!

734
01:14:49,406 --> 01:14:51,991
You pack of ingrates!

735
01:15:00,542 --> 01:15:03,670
The oars have gone missing.
Find them!

736
01:15:13,096 --> 01:15:14,055
You.

737
01:15:15,473 --> 01:15:18,852
- You're supposed to be dead!
- Am I not?

738
01:15:43,877 --> 01:15:47,797
- Parley?
- That's the one. Parley! Parley!

739
01:15:48,465 --> 01:15:49,257
Parley?

740
01:15:50,550 --> 01:15:54,304
Damned to the depths whatever
muttonhead thought up parley?

741
01:15:56,389 --> 01:15:57,849
That would be the French.

742
01:16:09,944 --> 01:16:13,114
- Not more pirates.
- Welcome aboard, Miss Elizabeth.

743
01:16:14,574 --> 01:16:17,243
- Mr. Gibbs?
- Hey, boy! Where be Jack?

744
01:16:18,453 --> 01:16:20,789
Jack?
Jack Sparrow?

745
01:16:22,874 --> 01:16:23,917
He fell behind.

746
01:16:31,591 --> 01:16:32,634
Keep to the code.

747
01:16:34,386 --> 01:16:35,387
Weigh anchor!

748
01:16:35,387 --> 01:16:39,391
Hoist the sails!
Make quickly.

749
01:16:45,146 --> 01:16:48,274
How the blazes did you
get off that island?

750
01:16:49,317 --> 01:16:53,196
When you marooned me on that godforsaken spit of land,

751
01:16:53,196 --> 01:16:55,281
you forgot one very important thing mate...

752
01:16:57,200 --> 01:16:59,452
I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.

753
01:16:59,869 --> 01:17:04,124
Ah, well, I won't be making
that mistake again.

754
01:17:04,749 --> 01:17:08,920
- Gents, you all remember Captain Jack Sparrow?
- Yeah!

755
01:17:10,422 --> 01:17:11,214
Kill him!

756
01:17:13,008 --> 01:17:15,093
The girl's blood didn't work, did it?

757
01:17:17,971 --> 01:17:19,556
Hold your fire!

758
01:17:25,812 --> 01:17:28,398
You know whose blood we need?

759
01:17:30,233 --> 01:17:32,068
I know whose blood ye need.

760
01:17:39,284 --> 01:17:41,911
What sort of a man trades
a man's life for a ship?

761
01:17:41,911 --> 01:17:43,204
Pirate.

762
01:17:44,497 --> 01:17:48,293
- Here, let me.
- Thank you.

763
01:17:50,670 --> 01:17:55,884
You said you gave Barbossa
my name as yours. Why?

764
01:17:59,095 --> 01:18:00,430
I don't know.

765
01:18:02,307 --> 01:18:05,685
I'm sorry. Blacksmith's hands,
I know they're rough.

766
01:18:05,894 --> 01:18:07,979
No...I mean yes,
they are but...

767
01:18:12,359 --> 01:18:13,485
...but don't stop.

768
01:18:21,826 --> 01:18:23,161
Elizabeth...

769
01:18:39,469 --> 01:18:40,512
It's yours.

770
01:18:44,766 --> 01:18:47,102
I thought I'd lost it the
day they rescued me.

771
01:18:48,645 --> 01:18:52,065
It was a gift from my father,
he sent it to me.

772
01:18:58,363 --> 01:18:59,698
Why did you take it?

773
01:19:01,783 --> 01:19:03,952
Because I was afraid
that you were a pirate.

774
01:19:06,037 --> 01:19:07,831
That would've been awful.

775
01:19:11,251 --> 01:19:13,586
It wasn't your blood they needed...

776
01:19:16,715 --> 01:19:18,299
it was my father's blood...

777
01:19:20,635 --> 01:19:21,678
my blood.

778
01:19:28,184 --> 01:19:29,227
The blood of a pirate.

779
01:19:29,769 --> 01:19:31,855
I'm so sorry, please forgive me.

780
01:19:45,118 --> 01:19:49,039
So you expect to leave me standing on some
beach with nothing but a name and your word...

781
01:19:49,080 --> 01:19:53,209
...it's the one I need and watch
you sail away on my ship?

782
01:19:54,502 --> 01:19:58,631
No. I expect to leave you standing on
some beach with absolutely no name...

783
01:19:58,631 --> 01:20:04,512
...at all, watching me sail away on my ship
and then I'll shout the name back to you.

784
01:20:04,721 --> 01:20:05,513
Savvy?

785
01:20:06,139 --> 01:20:09,142
But that still leaves us with the problem
of me standing on some beach with naught

786
01:20:09,184 --> 01:20:12,604
...but a name and your word
it's the one I need.

787
01:20:13,813 --> 01:20:18,735
Of the two of us I am the only one
who hasn't committed mutiny.

788
01:20:19,319 --> 01:20:23,031
Therefore my word is the
one we'll be trusting.

789
01:20:23,531 --> 01:20:27,202
Although, I suppose I should be
thanking you because in fact...

790
01:20:27,202 --> 01:20:29,996
...if you hadn't betrayed
me and left me to die...

791
01:20:29,996 --> 01:20:33,708
...I would have an equal share
in that curse same as you.

792
01:20:35,543 --> 01:20:37,212
Funny ol' world, innit?

793
01:20:40,757 --> 01:20:43,093
Captain, we're coming
up on the Interceptor.

794
01:20:56,481 --> 01:21:00,819
I'm having a thought here, Barbossa.
What say we run up a flag of truce?

795
01:21:00,902 --> 01:21:03,321
I scurry over to the Interceptor...

796
01:21:03,321 --> 01:21:05,156
...and I negotiate the return
of your medallion, aye?

797
01:21:05,156 --> 01:21:06,199
What say you to that?

798
01:21:06,616 --> 01:21:11,413
Now you see, Jack, that's exactly the
attitude that lost you the Pearl.

799
01:21:11,454 --> 01:21:13,498
People are easy to search
when they're dead.

800
01:21:15,041 --> 01:21:16,292
Lock him in the brig!

801
01:21:29,014 --> 01:21:34,310
Hands aloft to loose t'gallants. With this
wind she'll carry every sail we've got.

802
01:21:34,477 --> 01:21:38,189
- What's happening?
- The Black Pearl, she's gaining on us.

803
01:21:43,194 --> 01:21:45,030
This is the fastest ship
in the Caribbean.

804
01:21:45,071 --> 01:21:47,365
You can tell them that
after they've caught us.

805
01:21:48,408 --> 01:21:50,618
- We're shallow on the draft, right?
- Aye.

806
01:21:51,161 --> 01:21:52,996
Well, then can't we lose them
amongst those shoals?

807
01:21:54,914 --> 01:21:57,292
We don't have to outrun them
long, just long enough.

808
01:21:57,334 --> 01:22:00,003
Lighten the ship,
stem to stern.

809
01:22:00,211 --> 01:22:03,214
Anything that we can afford to lose...
see that it's lost!

810
01:22:13,266 --> 01:22:14,309
Apparently there's a leak.

811
01:22:29,657 --> 01:22:32,827
Haul on the main brace.
Make ready the guns.

812
01:22:33,036 --> 01:22:35,789
And run out the sweeps.

813
01:23:02,857 --> 01:23:04,693
We're gonna need that.

814
01:23:13,159 --> 01:23:17,455
- It was a good plan up 'till now.
- Gibbs!

815
01:23:17,455 --> 01:23:21,376
We have to make a stand.
We must fight!

816
01:23:21,793 --> 01:23:23,920
- Load the guns!
- With what?

817
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:27,465
Anything. Everything!
Anything we have left.

818
01:23:29,384 --> 01:23:30,969
Load the guns!

819
01:23:31,678 --> 01:23:35,348
Take shot and langrage.
Nails and crushed glass!

820
01:23:37,434 --> 01:23:38,268
With a will!

821
01:23:59,998 --> 01:24:02,584
The pearl is going to luff up on our port quarter.

822
01:24:02,667 --> 01:24:05,128
She'll rake us without ever presenting a target.

823
01:24:05,128 --> 01:24:07,380
Lower the anchor on the right side.

824
01:24:08,173 --> 01:24:12,093
- On the starboard side!
- It certainly has the element of surprise.

825
01:24:12,093 --> 01:24:16,431
- You're daft, lady! You both are!
- Daft like Jack.

826
01:24:16,681 --> 01:24:18,475
Lower the starboard anchor!

827
01:24:19,142 --> 01:24:21,978
Do it ye dogs or it's you we'll
load into the cannons!

828
01:24:41,498 --> 01:24:43,124
Let go!

829
01:24:48,922 --> 01:24:50,090
They're clubhaulin'!

830
01:24:51,007 --> 01:24:53,385
Hard aport.
Rack the starboard oars!

831
01:24:53,635 --> 01:24:54,552
Hard aport!

832
01:25:07,107 --> 01:25:07,774
Keep us steady now!

833
01:25:15,448 --> 01:25:16,116
Now!

834
01:25:16,199 --> 01:25:18,201
- Fire!
- Fire!

835
01:25:27,961 --> 01:25:30,046
Stop blowing holes in my ship!

836
01:26:16,676 --> 01:26:19,804
- We could use a few more ideas, lass!
- Your turn!

837
01:26:20,096 --> 01:26:22,182
We need us a devil's dowry.

838
01:26:22,557 --> 01:26:26,061
- We'll give them her.
- She's not what they're after.

839
01:26:28,688 --> 01:26:29,856
The medallion.

840
01:26:51,711 --> 01:26:54,798
Strike yer colors ya bloomin' cockroaches.

841
01:26:55,006 --> 01:26:58,885
Hands! Grapples, at the ready.
Prepare to board!

842
01:27:36,214 --> 01:27:38,758
Koehler and Twigg go to the powder magazine! 

843
01:27:39,134 --> 01:27:42,303
And the rest of you bring me the medallion!

844
01:28:10,206 --> 01:28:14,002
Hey! Below!

845
01:28:33,021 --> 01:28:33,980
Thanks very much.

846
01:28:47,535 --> 01:28:48,578
Jack!

847
01:28:49,871 --> 01:28:50,914
Bloody empty.

848
01:29:07,555 --> 01:29:08,765
That's not very nice.

849
01:29:14,437 --> 01:29:15,480
Where's the medallion?

850
01:29:15,689 --> 01:29:16,856
Wretch!

851
01:29:18,608 --> 01:29:23,613
- Ah, where's dear William?
- Will.

852
01:29:26,783 --> 01:29:28,284
- Will!
- Elizabeth!

853
01:29:32,038 --> 01:29:33,164
Monkey!

854
01:29:39,921 --> 01:29:40,964
I can't move it!

855
01:29:43,883 --> 01:29:44,968
Elizabeth!

856
01:29:57,230 --> 01:30:00,775
- Why thank you, Jack.
- You're welcome.

857
01:30:00,859 --> 01:30:04,279
Not you. We named the monkey Jack.

858
01:30:04,696 --> 01:30:09,117
- Gents, our hope is restored!
- Yeah!

859
01:30:44,152 --> 01:30:49,949
If any of you so much as thinks the word parley,
I'll have your guts for garters.

860
01:30:58,708 --> 01:30:59,834
Will...

861
01:31:00,210 --> 01:31:03,338
You’ve got to stop it!
Stop it!

862
01:31:03,505 --> 01:31:07,384
Welcome back, Miss. You took
advantage of our hospitality last time.

863
01:31:07,926 --> 01:31:11,054
It holds fair now that
you return the favor.

864
01:31:16,643 --> 01:31:17,936
Barbossa!

865
01:31:20,230 --> 01:31:21,147
Will.

866
01:31:23,983 --> 01:31:25,652
She goes free!

867
01:31:26,069 --> 01:31:30,073
- What's in your head, boy?
- She goes free!

868
01:31:30,865 --> 01:31:33,827
You've only got one shot
and we can't die.

869
01:31:34,119 --> 01:31:36,121
Don't do anything stupid.

870
01:31:39,040 --> 01:31:41,918
You can't...I can.

871
01:31:43,920 --> 01:31:44,796
Like that.

872
01:31:46,089 --> 01:31:49,384
- Who are you?
- No one. He's no one.

873
01:31:49,801 --> 01:31:53,388
A distant cousin of my aunt's
nephew twice removed.

874
01:31:53,388 --> 01:31:55,306
Lovely singing voice, though.
Eunuch.

875
01:31:55,306 --> 01:31:59,352
My name is Will Turner.
My father was Bootstrap Bill Turner.

876
01:31:59,561 --> 01:32:02,272
His blood runs in my veins.

877
01:32:02,272 --> 01:32:06,651
He's a spitting image of ol' Bootstrap
Bill come back to haunt us.

878
01:32:07,193 --> 01:32:11,114
On my word do as I say or
I'll pull this trigger...

879
01:32:11,114 --> 01:32:13,033
and be lost to Davy Jones' Locker.

880
01:32:14,159 --> 01:32:17,829
- Name your terms, Mr. Turner.
- Elizabeth goes free.

881
01:32:17,954 --> 01:32:20,749
Yes, we know that one.
Anything else?

882
01:32:23,001 --> 01:32:26,254
And the crew, the crew
are not to be harmed.

883
01:32:31,176 --> 01:32:32,635
Agreed.

884
01:32:39,267 --> 01:32:41,436
Go on! Walk the plank!

885
01:32:52,364 --> 01:32:55,992
Barbossa, you lying bastard!
You swore she'd go free!

886
01:32:55,992 --> 01:33:01,664
Don't dare impugn me honor, boy.
I agreed she'd go free it was you who failed...

887
01:33:01,664 --> 01:33:03,583
...to specify when or where.

888
01:33:09,589 --> 01:33:13,259
Though it does seem a shame to lose
something so fine, don't it lads?

889
01:33:15,387 --> 01:33:18,264
So I'll be having that
dress back before you go.

890
01:33:22,769 --> 01:33:23,728
I always liked you.

891
01:33:27,982 --> 01:33:29,359
It goes with your black heart.

892
01:33:31,736 --> 01:33:32,946
Ooh, it's still warm.

893
01:33:36,366 --> 01:33:37,283
Off you go!

894
01:33:39,035 --> 01:33:39,828
Come on!

895
01:33:43,915 --> 01:33:44,874
Too long!

896
01:33:55,635 --> 01:33:58,513
I really had rather hoped
we were past all this.

897
01:33:59,973 --> 01:34:02,684
Jack. Jack!

898
01:34:04,102 --> 01:34:05,520
Did ya not notice?

899
01:34:05,687 --> 01:34:10,775
That be the same little island that we made you Governor of on our last little trip.

900
01:34:11,484 --> 01:34:13,194
I did notice.

901
01:34:13,194 --> 01:34:16,990
Perhaps you'll be able to conjure
up another miraculous escape.

902
01:34:17,198 --> 01:34:20,243
But I doubt it.

903
01:34:21,870 --> 01:34:23,163
Off you go.

904
01:34:24,456 --> 01:34:26,875
Last time you left me
a pistol with one shot.

905
01:34:27,167 --> 01:34:32,005
By the powers, you're right. Were
be Jack's pistol? Bring it forward.

906
01:34:35,759 --> 01:34:39,971
Seeing as there's two of us, a gentleman
would give us a pair of pistols.

907
01:34:40,388 --> 01:34:43,475
It'll be one pistol as before
and you can be the gentleman...

908
01:34:43,475 --> 01:34:47,270
...and shoot the lady and
starve to death yourself.

909
01:35:11,294 --> 01:35:14,589
That's the second time I've had to watch
that man sail away with my ship.

910
01:35:17,384 --> 01:35:20,136
But you were marooned on this island before, weren't you?

911
01:35:20,136 --> 01:35:21,805
So we can escape in the same way you did then.

912
01:35:21,971 --> 01:35:23,890
To what point and purpose, young missy?

913
01:35:24,683 --> 01:35:26,267
The Black Pearl is gone.

914
01:35:26,768 --> 01:35:29,979
And unless you have a rudder and
a lot of sails hidden in that bodice...

915
01:35:30,480 --> 01:35:35,318
unlikely, young Mr. Turner will be dead
long before you can reach him.

916
01:35:38,071 --> 01:35:40,281
But you're Captain Jack Sparrow.

917
01:35:40,865 --> 01:35:44,494
You vanished from under the eyes of
7 agents of the East India Company.

918
01:35:44,661 --> 01:35:47,789
You sacked Nassau Port
without even firing a shot.

919
01:35:47,789 --> 01:35:49,958
Are you the pirate
I've read about or not?

920
01:35:52,585 --> 01:35:53,962
How did you escape last time?

921
01:36:00,885 --> 01:36:04,889
Last time...I was here a grand
total of three days, alright?

922
01:36:06,891 --> 01:36:07,892
Last time...

923
01:36:09,894 --> 01:36:12,689
...the rumrunners used this island as a cache.

924
01:36:12,981 --> 01:36:15,191
Came by and I was able
to barter a passage off.

925
01:36:15,984 --> 01:36:18,862
From the looks of things, they've
long been out of business.

926
01:36:19,654 --> 01:36:23,658
Probably have your bloody friend
Norrington to thank for that.

927
01:36:24,993 --> 01:36:26,369
So that's it then?

928
01:36:27,662 --> 01:36:31,583
That's the secret grand adventure
of the infamous Jack Sparrow?

929
01:36:32,792 --> 01:36:36,671
You spent three days lying
on a beach, drinking rum?

930
01:36:39,591 --> 01:36:41,092
Welcome to the Caribbean, love.

931
01:36:50,810 --> 01:36:54,105
We're devils and black sheep
and really bad eggs.

932
01:36:54,105 --> 01:37:01,196
Drink up me 'earties yo ho!
Yo ho yo ho a pirate's life for me!

933
01:37:01,279 --> 01:37:03,198
I love this song!

934
01:37:06,493 --> 01:37:08,495
Really bad eggs!

935
01:37:12,791 --> 01:37:16,670
When I get the Pearl back,
I'm gonna teach it to the whole crew.

936
01:37:17,587 --> 01:37:18,755
And we'll sing it all the time.

937
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:22,175
And you'll be positively the most
fearsome pirate in the Spanish Main.

938
01:37:22,967 --> 01:37:25,387
Not just the Spanish Main, love.

939
01:37:25,970 --> 01:37:28,973
The entire ocean...
the entire world.

940
01:37:30,266 --> 01:37:32,394
Wherever we want to go, we'll go.

941
01:37:32,477 --> 01:37:33,770
That's what a ship is, you know.

942
01:37:33,853 --> 01:37:38,066
It's not just a keel and a hull and a deck
and sails that's what a ship needs...

943
01:37:38,775 --> 01:37:40,860
but what a ship is...

944
01:37:41,778 --> 01:37:44,781
what the Black Pearl really is...

945
01:37:46,366 --> 01:37:47,867
...is freedom.

946
01:37:50,370 --> 01:37:51,371
Jack...

947
01:37:52,789 --> 01:37:55,875
it must be really terrible for you
to be trapped on this island.

948
01:37:57,085 --> 01:37:58,586
Oh, yes.

949
01:37:58,878 --> 01:38:03,675
But the company is infinitely
better than last time, I think.

950
01:38:05,885 --> 01:38:08,304
And the scenery has definitely improved.

951
01:38:08,304 --> 01:38:11,182
Mr. Sparrow, I'm not entirely sure that I've...

952
01:38:11,182 --> 01:38:14,269
...had enough rum
to allow that kind of talk.

953
01:38:15,270 --> 01:38:17,772
I know exactly what you mean, love.

954
01:38:24,779 --> 01:38:25,780
To freedom!

955
01:38:28,992 --> 01:38:30,869
To the Black Pearl.

956
01:39:00,273 --> 01:39:01,858
No! Not good!

957
01:39:02,692 --> 01:39:04,861
Stop! Not good!

958
01:39:05,612 --> 01:39:09,282
What are you doing? You burned
all the food, the shade, the rum!

959
01:39:09,491 --> 01:39:10,909
Yes, the rum is gone.

960
01:39:11,201 --> 01:39:12,577
Why is the rum gone?

961
01:39:12,786 --> 01:39:17,457
One, because it is a vile drink that turns even
the most respectable men into complete scoundrels.

962
01:39:17,457 --> 01:39:23,088
Two, that signal is over a thousand feet high.
The entire Royal Navy is out looking for me.

963
01:39:23,088 --> 01:39:26,174
Do you really think that there is even the
slightest chance that they won't see it?

964
01:39:26,675 --> 01:39:28,259
But why is the rum gone?

965
01:39:29,386 --> 01:39:31,221
Just wait, Captain Sparrow.

966
01:39:31,596 --> 01:39:34,307
You give it one hour, maybe two, keep
a weather eye open and you will see...

967
01:39:34,307 --> 01:39:36,184
...white sails on that horizon.

968
01:39:43,900 --> 01:39:46,319
Must've been terrible for you to be trapped here, Jack.

969
01:39:46,319 --> 01:39:47,987
Must've been terrible for you...

970
01:39:47,987 --> 01:39:49,989
Well it bloody is now!

971
01:39:57,288 --> 01:39:59,499
There'll be no living
with her after this.

972
01:40:00,583 --> 01:40:02,502
- But we've got to save Will!
- No!

973
01:40:02,794 --> 01:40:03,878
You're safe now.

974
01:40:04,295 --> 01:40:07,799
We will return to Port Royal immediately
not go gallivanting after pirates.

975
01:40:08,008 --> 01:40:10,010
Then we condemn him to death.

976
01:40:11,177 --> 01:40:13,179
The boy's fate is regrettable.

977
01:40:14,180 --> 01:40:16,808
But then so is his decision
to engage in piracy.

978
01:40:16,808 --> 01:40:20,186
To rescue me, to prevent anything
from happening to me!

979
01:40:20,478 --> 01:40:23,773
If I may be so bold as to interject
my professional opinion.

980
01:40:24,691 --> 01:40:27,193
The Pearl was listing near
to scuppers after the battle.

981
01:40:27,402 --> 01:40:29,779
It's very unlikely she'll be
able to make good time.

982
01:40:30,280 --> 01:40:31,406
Think about it.

983
01:40:32,198 --> 01:40:33,408
The Black Pearl.

984
01:40:34,075 --> 01:40:37,370
The last real pirate threat
in the Caribbean, mate.

985
01:40:38,371 --> 01:40:40,290
How can you pass that up?

986
01:40:42,584 --> 01:40:46,588
By remembering that I serve others,
Mr. Sparrow, not only myself.

987
01:40:46,796 --> 01:40:52,218
Commodore, I beg you, please do this.
For me...as a wedding gift.

988
01:40:53,178 --> 01:40:57,182
Elizabeth. Are you accepting
the Commodore's proposal?

989
01:41:00,101 --> 01:41:01,478
I am.

990
01:41:01,978 --> 01:41:04,898
A wedding!
I love weddings, drinks all around!

991
01:41:07,901 --> 01:41:10,612
I know. Clap him in irons, right?

992
01:41:13,198 --> 01:41:14,491
Mr. Sparrow.

993
01:41:15,575 --> 01:41:18,036
You will accompany these fine
men to the helm and provide us...

994
01:41:18,119 --> 01:41:19,996
...with the bearing to Isla de Muerta.

995
01:41:20,705 --> 01:41:24,501
You will then spend the rest of the voyage
contemplating all possible meanings of the phrase...

996
01:41:24,709 --> 01:41:27,087
"silent as the grave".

997
01:41:27,087 --> 01:41:28,505
Do I make myself clear?

998
01:41:29,089 --> 01:41:30,674
Inescapably clear.

999
01:41:35,428 --> 01:41:37,806
Shiver me timbers.

1000
01:41:37,806 --> 01:41:41,393
Cotton 'ere says you missed a bit.

1001
01:41:44,479 --> 01:41:45,772
You knew William Turner?

1002
01:41:47,774 --> 01:41:51,403
Ol' Bootstrap Bill...we knew him.

1003
01:41:51,903 --> 01:41:55,073
Never sat well with Bootstrap
what we did to Jack Sparrow.

1004
01:41:56,074 --> 01:41:57,409
The mutiny and all.

1005
01:41:58,576 --> 01:42:00,704
He said it wasn't right with the code.

1006
01:42:01,705 --> 01:42:05,083
That's why he sent off a piece of
the treasure to you as it were.

1007
01:42:06,292 --> 01:42:08,378
He said we deserved to be cursed...

1008
01:42:10,088 --> 01:42:11,798
...and remain cursed.

1009
01:42:12,090 --> 01:42:13,925
- Stupid blighter
- Good man.

1010
01:42:15,885 --> 01:42:17,595
But as you can imagine...

1011
01:42:17,971 --> 01:42:20,306
that didn't sit too well
with the Captain.

1012
01:42:20,890 --> 01:42:25,395
That didn't sit too well with the Captain,
at all. Tell him what Barbossa did.

1013
01:42:25,395 --> 01:42:27,272
I'm telling the story!

1014
01:42:29,983 --> 01:42:31,109
So...

1015
01:42:31,901 --> 01:42:33,486
what the Captain did...

1016
01:42:34,195 --> 01:42:36,781
he strapped a cannon to
Bootstraps' bootstraps.

1017
01:42:38,491 --> 01:42:41,578
The last we saw of ol' Bill Turner...

1018
01:42:41,578 --> 01:42:46,207
he was sinking to the crushing black
oblivion of Davy Jones' Locker.

1019
01:42:48,001 --> 01:42:49,586
'Course it was only after that...

1020
01:42:49,627 --> 01:42:52,088
we learned we needed his
blood to lift the curse.

1021
01:42:52,589 --> 01:42:54,883
That's what you call ironic.

1022
01:42:59,596 --> 01:43:00,972
Bring him!

1023
01:43:07,979 --> 01:43:09,689
I don't care for the situation.

1024
01:43:10,690 --> 01:43:13,610
Any attempt to storm the cave
could turn to an ambush.

1025
01:43:14,110 --> 01:43:16,196
Not if you're the one doing the ambushing.

1026
01:43:17,072 --> 01:43:20,492
I go in to convince Barbossa to send
his men out in their little boats.

1027
01:43:21,493 --> 01:43:26,581
You and your mates return to the Dauntless and blast the
bejesus outta them with your little cannons, aye?

1028
01:43:26,873 --> 01:43:28,291
What do you have to lose?

1029
01:43:29,292 --> 01:43:31,795
Nothing I'd lament being rid of.

1030
01:43:33,380 --> 01:43:35,590
Now, to be quite honest with you...

1031
01:43:36,091 --> 01:43:40,512
there's still a slight risk for those aboard the Dauntless
which includes the future Mrs. Commodore.

1032
01:43:41,971 --> 01:43:43,598
Sorry, but for your own safety.

1033
01:43:43,682 --> 01:43:46,726
I don't care what the Commodore
ordered, I have to tell him.

1034
01:43:46,768 --> 01:43:51,690
- The pirates...they cannot be killed!
- Don't worry, miss, he's already informed of that.

1035
01:43:51,773 --> 01:43:54,526
A little mermaid flopped up on deck
and told him the whole story.

1036
01:43:56,194 --> 01:43:58,113
This is Jack Sparrow's doing.

1037
01:44:09,916 --> 01:44:13,420
No reason to fret, it's just a prick of
the finger and a few drops of blood.

1038
01:44:13,795 --> 01:44:19,092
No mistakes this time. He's only
half-Turner. We spill it all.

1039
01:44:21,803 --> 01:44:23,096
Guess there is reason to fret.

1040
01:44:37,610 --> 01:44:39,112
Beg your pardon.

1041
01:44:39,446 --> 01:44:40,989
Begun by blood...

1042
01:44:40,989 --> 01:44:41,698
Excuse me.

1043
01:44:41,698 --> 01:44:43,908
...by blood un...

1044
01:44:46,911 --> 01:44:47,912
Jack!

1045
01:44:48,288 --> 01:44:51,499
- It's not possible.
- Not probable.

1046
01:44:52,625 --> 01:44:57,339
- Where's Elizabeth?
- She's safe, just like I promised.

1047
01:44:57,422 --> 01:45:00,592
She's all set to marry Norrington,
just like she promised.

1048
01:45:00,592 --> 01:45:02,719
And you get to die for her,
just like you promised

1049
01:45:02,802 --> 01:45:04,888
So we're all men of our word really.

1050
01:45:05,388 --> 01:45:08,099
Except for Elizabeth who
is, in fact, a woman.

1051
01:45:08,308 --> 01:45:10,226
Shut up! You're next!

1052
01:45:13,104 --> 01:45:15,273
You don't want to be doing that, mate.

1053
01:45:16,191 --> 01:45:18,818
No, I really think I do.

1054
01:45:19,819 --> 01:45:21,321
Your funeral.

1055
01:45:25,033 --> 01:45:28,620
- Why don't I want to be doing it?
- Well, because...

1056
01:45:29,871 --> 01:45:33,917
Because the HMS Dauntless,
pride of the Royal Navy...

1057
01:45:34,125 --> 01:45:37,796
is floating just offshore...

1058
01:45:38,213 --> 01:45:40,090
waiting for you.

1059
01:45:47,722 --> 01:45:49,307
What are we doing here?

1060
01:45:50,892 --> 01:45:54,354
Pirates come out...
unprepared and unawares.

1061
01:45:55,105 --> 01:45:56,606
We catch them in the crossfire...

1062
01:45:57,107 --> 01:45:59,567
send them down to see old Hobb.

1063
01:46:00,652 --> 01:46:02,987
I know why we're here.
I mean...

1064
01:46:03,196 --> 01:46:07,200
why aren't we doing what it was what
Mr. Sparrow said we should do.

1065
01:46:07,200 --> 01:46:11,204
- With the cannons and all.
- Because it was Mr. Sparrow who said it.

1066
01:46:14,499 --> 01:46:16,418
You think he wasn't telling the truth?

1067
01:46:17,002 --> 01:46:18,628
Just hear me out, mate.

1068
01:46:19,295 --> 01:46:22,716
You order your men to row out to the
Dauntless, they do what they do best.

1069
01:46:23,717 --> 01:46:27,429
Robert's your Uncle Fannie's your Aunt,
there you are with two ships.

1070
01:46:28,388 --> 01:46:31,016
The makings of your very own fleet.

1071
01:46:31,016 --> 01:46:34,310
'Course you'll take the grandest as
your flagship and who's to argue?

1072
01:46:34,728 --> 01:46:36,312
But what of the Pearl?

1073
01:46:37,522 --> 01:46:39,024
Name me Captain.

1074
01:46:39,524 --> 01:46:42,444
I'll sail under your colors,
I'll give you ten percent of me plunder...

1075
01:46:42,485 --> 01:46:44,696
...and you get to introduce yourself as...


1076
01:46:44,821 --> 01:46:48,825
...Commodore Barbossa. Savvy?

1077
01:46:49,409 --> 01:46:52,996
I suppose in exchange you want
me not to kill the whelp.

1078
01:46:53,121 --> 01:46:55,999
No, no, not at all by all
means, kill the whelp.

1079
01:46:56,291 --> 01:46:57,625
Just not yet.

1080
01:46:58,418 --> 01:47:00,920
Wait to lift the curse...

1081
01:47:01,421 --> 01:47:03,506
until the opportune moment.

1082
01:47:06,718 --> 01:47:08,553
For instance...

1083
01:47:10,180 --> 01:47:12,557
after you've killed Norrington's men...

1084
01:47:13,850 --> 01:47:18,188
every... last... one.

1085
01:47:28,198 --> 01:47:30,158
You've been planning this
from the beginning.

1086
01:47:30,700 --> 01:47:32,577
Ever since you learned my name.

1087
01:47:32,786 --> 01:47:34,162
Yeah.

1088
01:47:35,955 --> 01:47:37,916
I want fifty percent of your plunder.

1089
01:47:37,999 --> 01:47:39,501
- 15!
- 40!

1090
01:47:39,668 --> 01:47:40,710
- 25!

1091
01:47:41,670 --> 01:47:43,254
And I'll buy you the hat!

1092
01:47:43,463 --> 01:47:45,298
A really big one...

1093
01:47:45,924 --> 01:47:47,175
Commodore.

1094
01:47:49,969 --> 01:47:51,262
We have an accord.

1095
01:47:52,972 --> 01:47:54,724
All hand's to the boats!

1096
01:47:56,267 --> 01:47:59,479
Apologies, you give the orders.

1097
01:48:00,522 --> 01:48:04,776
Gents! Take a walk!

1098
01:48:09,072 --> 01:48:10,365
Not to the boats?

1099
01:49:09,674 --> 01:49:11,051
Hold fire!

1100
01:49:14,637 --> 01:49:17,307
This is just like what the
Greeks done at Troy.

1101
01:49:18,558 --> 01:49:21,978
Except they was in a
horse instead of dresses.

1102
01:49:21,978 --> 01:49:23,313
Wooden horse.

1103
01:49:36,868 --> 01:49:37,911
A moment, please.

1104
01:49:42,082 --> 01:49:43,083
Elizabeth?

1105
01:49:46,461 --> 01:49:51,091
I just want you to know I...I believe you
made a very good decision today.

1106
01:49:51,883 --> 01:49:54,010
Couldn't be more proud of you.

1107
01:49:55,095 --> 01:49:58,765
But you know, even a good decision
if made for the wrong reasons...

1108
01:49:58,765 --> 01:50:00,266
...can be a wrong decision.

1109
01:50:09,859 --> 01:50:10,694
Lieutenant?

1110
01:50:29,963 --> 01:50:31,172
Elizabeth?

1111
01:50:33,383 --> 01:50:34,968
Are you there?

1112
01:50:37,012 --> 01:50:38,763
Elizabeth, are you even listening to me?

1113
01:51:05,665 --> 01:51:07,917
Oh, what have you done?

1114
01:51:09,753 --> 01:51:12,672
Stop that!
I already feel like a fool.

1115
01:51:13,089 --> 01:51:14,591
You look nice, though.

1116
01:51:19,220 --> 01:51:20,305
I look nice?

1117
01:51:57,676 --> 01:52:00,136
I must admit, Jack,
I thought I had ye figured.

1118
01:52:00,512 --> 01:52:03,973
It turns out that you're
a hard man to predict.

1119
01:52:03,973 --> 01:52:07,977
Me? I'm dishonest, and a dishonest
man you can always trust to be...

1120
01:52:08,144 --> 01:52:09,187
...dishonest.

1121
01:52:09,187 --> 01:52:13,108
Honestly. It's the honest
ones you want to watch out for.

1122
01:52:13,316 --> 01:52:17,237
Because you can never predict when they're
going to do something incredibly...

1123
01:52:18,196 --> 01:52:19,406
...stupid.

1124
01:52:53,106 --> 01:52:56,860
You're off the edge of the map, mate.
Here there be monsters.

1125
01:53:02,115 --> 01:53:04,993
Roger that.

1126
01:53:04,993 --> 01:53:08,329
What would you pick to eat first?
I think we should decide now.

1127
01:53:08,538 --> 01:53:11,750
Just so we're ready
when the time comes.

1128
01:53:36,524 --> 01:53:37,859
What was that?

1129
01:54:00,382 --> 01:54:01,841
It's Elizabeth!

1130
01:54:21,528 --> 01:54:23,863
Make for the ship! Move!

1131
01:55:17,250 --> 01:55:18,877
You can't beat me Jack.

1132
01:55:43,318 --> 01:55:44,819
That's interesting.

1133
01:55:55,789 --> 01:55:57,332
Couldn't resist, mate.

1134
01:57:04,107 --> 01:57:05,025
Sorry.

1135
01:57:14,659 --> 01:57:18,038
So what now, Jack Sparrow? Will
it be two immortals locked in...

1136
01:57:18,038 --> 01:57:21,833
an epic battle until Judgment
Day and trumpets sound?

1137
01:57:22,542 --> 01:57:23,626
Or you could surrender.

1138
01:57:50,945 --> 01:57:53,823
All of you with me. Will is in that
cave and we must save him.

1139
01:57:54,032 --> 01:57:56,951
Ready? And heave!

1140
01:58:03,833 --> 01:58:06,628
Please, I need your help, come on!

1141
01:58:06,628 --> 01:58:08,630
Any port in the storm.

1142
01:58:08,630 --> 01:58:10,924
Cotton's right, we've got the Pearl.

1143
01:58:11,049 --> 01:58:14,928
- What about Jack, you're just going to leave him?
- Jack owes us a ship.

1144
01:58:14,928 --> 01:58:17,722
- There's the code to consider
- The code?

1145
01:58:20,433 --> 01:58:24,062
You're pirates, hang the
code and hang the rules.

1146
01:58:24,062 --> 01:58:26,940
They're more like guidelines anyway.

1147
01:58:30,527 --> 01:58:32,153
Bloody pirates!

1148
01:58:42,247 --> 01:58:43,790
- Oy.
- What?

1149
01:58:44,207 --> 01:58:48,461
- Is it supposed to be doing that?
- They're stealing our ship.

1150
01:58:49,129 --> 01:58:50,839
Bloody pirates!

1151
01:59:03,018 --> 01:59:05,228
Come on!

1152
01:59:29,794 --> 01:59:31,629
Ah, me eye!

1153
01:59:52,233 --> 01:59:54,152
I'm gonna teach you
the meaning of pain.

1154
01:59:54,152 --> 01:59:55,528
You like pain?

1155
01:59:57,322 --> 01:59:58,865
Try wearing a corset.

1156
02:00:09,542 --> 02:00:12,462
- Whose side is Jack on?
- At the moment?

1157
02:00:48,957 --> 02:00:50,333
No fair.

1158
02:01:13,857 --> 02:01:17,861
Ten years you carry that pistol
and now you waste your shot.

1159
02:01:19,237 --> 02:01:20,655
He didn't waste it.

1160
02:01:47,057 --> 02:01:48,433
I feel...

1161
02:01:52,937 --> 02:01:54,481
...cold.

1162
02:02:56,334 --> 02:02:57,752
Parley?

1163
02:02:59,045 --> 02:03:00,922
The ship is ours, gentlemen.

1164
02:03:49,137 --> 02:03:51,056
We should return to the Dauntless.

1165
02:03:54,059 --> 02:03:56,436
Your fiancé will be wanting
to know you're safe.

1166
02:04:07,364 --> 02:04:09,866
If you were waiting for the
opportune moment...

1167
02:04:11,534 --> 02:04:12,827
...that was it.

1168
02:04:14,454 --> 02:04:18,249
Now if you'll be so kind, I'd be much
obliged if you'd drop me off my ship.

1169
02:04:23,922 --> 02:04:25,840
I'm sorry, Jack.

1170
02:04:27,926 --> 02:04:32,138
They done what's right by them.
Can't expect more than that.

1171
02:04:48,154 --> 02:04:49,072
Jack Sparrow...

1172
02:04:51,074 --> 02:04:53,660
Captain.
Captain Jack Sparrow.

1173
02:04:53,660 --> 02:04:56,955
...for your willful commission
of crimes against the crown.

1174
02:04:57,997 --> 02:05:02,752
Said crimes being numerous in
quantity and sinister in nature.

1175
02:05:03,169 --> 02:05:06,756
The most grievous of these
to be cited herewith:

1176
02:05:07,549 --> 02:05:09,467
Piracy, smuggling...

1177
02:05:09,801 --> 02:05:11,344
This is wrong.

1178
02:05:12,012 --> 02:05:16,641
Commodore Norrington is bound
by the law. As are we all.

1179
02:05:17,475 --> 02:05:20,562
...impersonating an officer of
the Spanish Royal Navy...

1180
02:05:20,562 --> 02:05:23,440
...impersonating a cleric of
the Church of England...

1181
02:05:23,440 --> 02:05:30,572
...sailing under false colors, arson,
kidnapping, looting, poaching...

1182
02:05:31,448 --> 02:05:39,164
...brigandage, pilfering, depravity,
depredation and general lawlessness.

1183
02:05:39,581 --> 02:05:44,461
And for these crimes you have been
sentenced to be on this day...

1184
02:05:44,461 --> 02:05:46,880
...hung by the neck until dead.

1185
02:05:48,757 --> 02:05:51,051
May God have mercy on your soul.

1186
02:05:51,051 --> 02:05:53,845
Governor Swann.
Commodore.

1187
02:05:56,139 --> 02:05:57,140
Elizabeth.

1188
02:05:58,767 --> 02:06:01,144
I should have told you every day
from the moment I met you...

1189
02:06:04,356 --> 02:06:05,857
I love you.

1190
02:06:22,457 --> 02:06:23,249
Marines.

1191
02:06:23,375 --> 02:06:25,543
Can't breathe.

1192
02:06:26,461 --> 02:06:27,962
Elizabeth.

1193
02:06:30,548 --> 02:06:31,675
Move!

1194
02:07:45,540 --> 02:07:49,544
I thought we might have to endure some
manner of ill conceived escape attempt...

1195
02:07:50,170 --> 02:07:51,171
...but not from you.

1196
02:07:51,963 --> 02:07:54,549
On our return to Port Royal,
I granted you clemency.

1197
02:07:55,383 --> 02:07:57,177
And this is how you thank me?

1198
02:07:57,552 --> 02:08:00,930
By throwing in your lot with him?
He's a pirate.

1199
02:08:01,389 --> 02:08:02,891
And a good man.

1200
02:08:04,559 --> 02:08:07,103
If all I have achieved here is that
the hangman will earn two pairs...

1201
02:08:07,103 --> 02:08:09,773
of boots instead of one,
so be it.

1202
02:08:09,981 --> 02:08:11,983
At least my conscience
will be clear.

1203
02:08:11,983 --> 02:08:15,779
You forget your place, Turner.

1204
02:08:16,863 --> 02:08:19,866
It's right here,
between you and Jack.

1205
02:08:24,579 --> 02:08:27,791
- As is mine.
- Elizabeth.

1206
02:08:28,458 --> 02:08:29,793
Lower your weapons!

1207
02:08:30,960 --> 02:08:33,088
For goodness' sake put them down!

1208
02:08:37,467 --> 02:08:40,762
So this is where your
heart truly lies, then?

1209
02:08:42,180 --> 02:08:43,556
It is.

1210
02:08:52,232 --> 02:08:55,485
Well! I'm actually feeling
rather good about this.

1211
02:08:55,568 --> 02:08:58,488
I think we've all arrived at
a very special place, eh?

1212
02:08:58,488 --> 02:09:02,492
Spiritually, ecumenically,
grammatically.

1213
02:09:04,786 --> 02:09:07,664
I want you to know that
I was rooting for you, mate.

1214
02:09:08,456 --> 02:09:09,374
Know that.

1215
02:09:13,795 --> 02:09:15,171
Elizabeth...

1216
02:09:17,257 --> 02:09:19,175
it would never have worked
between us, darling.

1217
02:09:21,469 --> 02:09:23,888
I'm sorry.

1218
02:09:25,181 --> 02:09:26,683
Will...

1219
02:09:28,393 --> 02:09:30,270
nice hat.

1220
02:09:31,771 --> 02:09:32,772
Men!

1221
02:09:35,358 --> 02:09:39,279
This is the day that you will always
remember as the day that you...

1222
02:09:45,577 --> 02:09:46,453
Idiot.

1223
02:09:46,453 --> 02:09:48,872
He has nowhere to go
but back to the noose.

1224
02:09:50,582 --> 02:09:51,666
Sail ho!

1225
02:10:00,175 --> 02:10:01,593
What's your plan of action?

1226
02:10:03,470 --> 02:10:04,971
Sir?

1227
02:10:09,059 --> 02:10:12,479
Perhaps on the rare occasion,
pursuing the right course...

1228
02:10:12,479 --> 02:10:14,189
...demands an act of piracy...

1229
02:10:15,482 --> 02:10:18,568
piracy itself can be
the right course?

1230
02:10:23,573 --> 02:10:24,574
Mr. Turner.

1231
02:10:30,997 --> 02:10:33,375
I will accept the consequences
of my actions.

1232
02:10:39,673 --> 02:10:42,092
This is a beautiful sword.

1233
02:10:43,968 --> 02:10:46,930
I would expect the man who made
it to show the same care and...

1234
02:10:46,930 --> 02:10:49,683
...devotion in every
aspect of his life.

1235
02:10:51,184 --> 02:10:52,560
Thank you.

1236
02:10:56,940 --> 02:10:57,857
Commodore!

1237
02:10:58,775 --> 02:11:01,194
What about Sparrow?

1238
02:11:01,277 --> 02:11:05,740
Well, I think we can afford to give
him one day's head start.

1239
02:11:11,371 --> 02:11:17,085
So, this is the path you've chosen, is it?

1240
02:11:18,586 --> 02:11:22,590
After all...he is a blacksmith.

1241
02:11:23,258 --> 02:11:24,592
No.

1242
02:11:29,472 --> 02:11:30,473
He's a pirate.

1243
02:12:07,886 --> 02:12:10,096
I thought you were supposed
to keep to the code.

1244
02:12:10,388 --> 02:12:13,892
We figured they were more
actual...guidelines.

1245
02:12:18,980 --> 02:12:20,357
Thank you.

1246
02:12:21,483 --> 02:12:23,485
Captain Sparrow.

1247
02:12:27,572 --> 02:12:29,282
...the Black Pearl is yours.

1248
02:12:45,090 --> 02:12:48,385
On deck you scabrous dogs!
Man the braces!

1249
02:12:52,389 --> 02:12:56,059
Now...bring me that horizon.

1250
02:13:03,358 --> 02:13:05,568
And really bad eggs.

1251
02:13:08,571 --> 02:13:11,533
Drink up, me 'arties yo ho.
