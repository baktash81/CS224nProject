01:37:03,280 --> 01:37:05,323
Hands behind your head!

1045
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:10,484
OFFICER 4: All right, all right,
we got him! Move in!

1046
01:37:12,600 --> 01:37:14,325
Move to the kitchen.

1047
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:18,239
Okay, I need to run some tests.

1048
01:37:18,240 --> 01:37:20,959
Don't be scared, son.
Your mom will be fine.

1049
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:22,119
We got the guy.

1050
01:37:22,120 --> 01:37:24,520
He won't be able to do anything
to you and your mom anymore.

1051
01:37:24,640 --> 01:37:26,759
Ma'am, over here. I need you
to look over here, please.

1052
01:37:26,760 --> 01:37:28,803
- I'm going to cut the tape.
- Can you hear me okay?

(CAR ENGINE STARTS)

1054
01:38:13,360 --> 01:38:15,722
<i>ADULT HENRY:
They charged him with kidnapping.</i>

1055
01:38:17,840 --> 01:38:19,359
<i>When my mother heard,</i>

1056
01:38:19,360 --> 01:38:23,159
<i>she drove to see the prosecutor
with me as a witness</i>

1057
01:38:23,160 --> 01:38:26,999
<i>to make him understand that no
unlawful detainment had taken place.</i>

1058
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,839
He didn't hurt us.
He is a good man.

1059
01:38:29,840 --> 01:38:32,088
He was kind to my son.

1060
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:36,084
<i>ADULT HENRY: She omitted the
fact that they were in love.</i>

1061
01:38:39,720 --> 01:38:42,679
Adele, these situations
are never simple.

1062
01:38:42,680 --> 01:38:44,519
Never clean.

1063
01:38:44,520 --> 01:38:47,724
It may take years for you to
fully weave it all together.

1064
01:38:48,520 --> 01:38:51,679
Now, perhaps, before putting this
kind of statement into record,

1065
01:38:51,680 --> 01:38:55,521
you might want to take some time to
think about what actually happened.

1066
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:59,602
Harboring a fugitive is a major
crime we don't look lightly upon.

1067
01:39:01,240 --> 01:39:04,364
And, of course, there is
delinquency to a minor.

1068
01:39:05,080 --> 01:39:07,408
You could lose custody of your son.

1069
01:39:13,880 --> 01:39:15,359
<i>ADULT HENRY:
They gave Frank 10 years</i>

1070
01:39:15,360 --> 01:39:18,404
<i>for the escape and 15
for the kidnapping.</i>

1071
01:39:19,240 --> 01:39:23,809
<i>My mother tried to visit him once,
but was told he was doing solitary.</i>

1072
01:39:25,760 --> 01:39:30,284
<i>She wrote to Frank, sometimes
daily, but received no response.</i>

1073
01:39:32,080 --> 01:39:33,719
<i>Eventually, a package arrived</i>

1074
01:39:33,720 --> 01:39:37,606
<i>containing all of her letters
stamped with a prison seal.</i>

1075
01:39:39,080 --> 01:39:41,601
<i>None of them had been opened.</i>

1076
01:39:43,280 --> 01:39:47,644
<i>She called to enquire and was
told Frank had been transferred.</i>

1077
01:39:53,280 --> 01:39:58,168
<i>Within a month, my mother voluntarily
relinquished custody of me to my father.</i>

1078
01:40:03,640 --> 01:40:05,799
<i>He rarely knew what to say.</i>

1079
01:40:05,800 --> 01:40:08,799
<i>More often than not,
he just kept quiet.</i>

1080
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:11,651
<i>The newspapers had
said it all anyway.</i>

1081
01:40:13,360 --> 01:40:16,959
<i>When I visited my mother,
she would act busy and distracted.</i>

1082
01:40:16,960 --> 01:40:19,479
<i>Calls to make, chores to do.</i>

1083
01:40:19,480 --> 01:40:22,799
<i>I think my presence
made her uncomfortable.</i>

1084
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:25,606
<i>A strange reminder
of what was missing.</i>

1085
01:40:27,640 --> 01:40:30,207
All those two had was each other.

1086
01:40:33,480 --> 01:40:35,364
That was enough.

1087
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:44,359
<i>By my junior year,</i>

1088
01:40:44,360 --> 01:40:48,167

(PEOPLE CHEERING)

1091
01:41:19,320 --> 01:41:21,319
There's something I've been
meaning to talk to you about.

1092
01:41:21,320 --> 01:41:24,364
Oh, Dad, please. We're
having such a pleasant time.

1093
01:41:26,040 --> 01:41:30,039
Everybody talks about all
this crazy, wild passion.

1094
01:41:30,040 --> 01:41:33,403
That's how it goes in
the songs. You know.

1095
01:41:34,320 --> 01:41:36,284
Your mother was like that.

1096
01:41:39,720 --> 01:41:42,399
She was in love with love.

1097
01:41:42,400 --> 01:41:44,728
She couldn't do anything partway.

1098
01:41:45,400 --> 01:41:47,602
She was a terrific woman.

1099
01:41:48,880 --> 01:41:50,286
Funny.

1100
01:41:51,560 --> 01:41:53,285
So beautiful.

1101
01:42:00,920 --> 01:42:06,126
A better man might have stayed around
and helped her through all that sadness.

1102
01:42:07,240 --> 01:42:09,408
But I couldn't bear it.

1103
01:42:10,760 --> 01:42:13,122
I just wanted a regular life.

1104
01:42:17,240 --> 01:42:21,490
I don't know what these last
few years have done to repair,

1105
01:42:23,560 --> 01:42:25,649
but I'm sorry I cut out on you.

1106
01:42:28,920 --> 01:42:30,485
It's okay.

1107
01:42:34,280 --> 01:42:36,482
I'm going to get the check.

my hand at baking.</i>

Day weekend together.</i>

1116

<i>Five of the best days of my life.</i>

1117

<i>I had always wondered who you would
become and what you would look like.</i>

1118

<i>And then one day, I came
across a familiar-looking pie.</i>

<i>And there you were.</i>

1120
01:44:31,520 --> 01:44:33,245
<i>I'm proud of you.</i>

01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:39,079

<i>However, I am due to
be released shortly.</i>

1123

<i>I am no longer young, but I have
plenty of good health remaining.</i>

1124
01:44:48,200 --> 01:44:51,319
<i>And I'd like to live much
the same way we discussed</i>

thought we'd be a family.</i>

has remarried by now.</i>

that she might be alone,</i>
