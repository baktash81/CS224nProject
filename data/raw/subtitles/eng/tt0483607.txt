You want to put
12 million people
under lock and key?

174
00:15:07,386 --> 00:15:11,379
Containment is our absolute
priority. We must implement
martial law now.

175
00:15:11,491 --> 00:15:12,651
Keep the people
off the streets

176
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:15,227
while we secure the blockade
and set up medical stations.

177
00:15:15,328 --> 00:15:17,990
Only then can we begin
the evacuation.
HATCHER: Do it.

178
00:15:18,131 --> 00:15:20,622
It's all very well packing
people into their homes

179
00:15:20,733 --> 00:15:22,564
like so many
million sardines,

180
00:15:22,668 --> 00:15:25,159
but you drop a killer virus
into that mix,

181
00:15:25,271 --> 00:15:28,104
and this town
is gonna go tits-up
in no short order.

182
00:15:28,207 --> 00:15:31,870
Once you start stacking
bodies in the streets,
there'll be panic,

183
00:15:31,978 --> 00:15:36,847
public disorder,
looting, rape, murder,
and that's just for starters.

184
00:15:36,949 --> 00:15:38,940
The death toll will
be unimaginable,

185
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:43,767
and by that time,
there'll be absolutely
fuck-all we can do about it.

186
00:15:43,873 --> 00:15:47,400
You have to think
of the millions that
we'll be saving.

187
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:50,946
Are you talking about people?
Or pound notes?

188
00:15:52,816 --> 00:15:55,751
Chief Nelson,
would you join me
in my office?

189
00:15:59,689 --> 00:16:01,884
If this is a bollocking,
make it quick.

190
00:16:01,991 --> 00:16:04,391
I've got a job to do,
I need to be out there
on the streets.

191
00:16:04,494 --> 00:16:05,586
Michael.

192
00:16:05,695 --> 00:16:07,959
What we're about to show you
is highly confidential

193
00:16:08,064 --> 00:16:10,396
and potentially
volatile material.

194
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,661
When the wall went up,
the government at that
time, naturally,

195
00:16:12,769 --> 00:16:14,066
wanted to know
what was happening
on the other side.

196
00:16:15,889 --> 00:16:18,153
So they re-tasked one of
their military satellites

197
00:16:18,257 --> 00:16:20,487
to provide coverage
of Edinburgh and Glasgow.

198
00:16:20,593 --> 00:16:24,359
For the past 30 years,
it's carried on
taking pictures,

199
00:16:24,463 --> 00:16:29,560
sending down what you'd
expect. Empty cities,
deserted streets.

200
00:16:29,669 --> 00:16:33,105
That is,
until three years ago,
when these turned up.

201
00:16:40,846 --> 00:16:41,938
HATCHER: People.

202
00:16:42,048 --> 00:16:43,572
On the streets of Glasgow.

203
00:16:43,683 --> 00:16:46,151
Survivors?
What else could it be?

204
00:16:46,819 --> 00:16:50,186
And if there are survivors,
there must surely be a cure.

205
00:16:50,289 --> 00:16:52,086
What we have to do
is get our hands on it.

206
00:16:52,191 --> 00:16:54,785
We already have
a team standing by.

207
00:16:55,695 --> 00:16:57,560
All we need is somebody
to lead them.

208
00:16:57,663 --> 00:17:00,097
Someone to take them in,
find the cure

209
00:17:00,199 --> 00:17:01,791
and deliver it into our hands
before it's too late
to turn the tide.

210
00:17:04,036 --> 00:17:06,698
You don't know how many
survivors there are.

211
00:17:06,806 --> 00:17:10,037
And the team might not find
them in time. They might
not find them at all.

212
00:17:10,142 --> 00:17:12,610
And they could
still be contagious.

213
00:17:12,712 --> 00:17:14,771
That's what the team's
going to find out.

214
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,281
You've known for
three fucking years
that they were up there,

215
00:17:18,384 --> 00:17:20,113
but you swept it
under the carpet.

216
00:17:20,219 --> 00:17:23,052
Scotland's dead
have long since
been laid to rest.

217
00:17:23,155 --> 00:17:26,056
Yesterday, if I turned up
on the 6:00 news with
a survivor in tow,

218
00:17:26,158 --> 00:17:29,025
they'd have strung me up
from the nearest lamp-post
by the balls.

219
00:17:29,128 --> 00:17:33,792
But if, in 48 hours,
I arrive with a survivor
and a cure,

220
00:17:33,899 --> 00:17:36,163
sure they won't
give a flying fuck
about the survivor,

221
00:17:36,268 --> 00:17:39,169
but they'll be lining up
to kiss my arse
for that cure.

222
00:17:39,271 --> 00:17:42,638
In politics,
survival is timing,
and ours is running out.

223
00:17:42,742 --> 00:17:43,902
We have 48 hours.

224
00:17:44,009 --> 00:17:45,408
I need your best man
on this, right away.

225
00:17:49,965 --> 00:17:51,330
All right.

226
00:17:53,302 --> 00:17:55,827
I know someone who might
just fit the bill.

227
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:18,866
Get in the car,
it's pissing down.

228
00:18:29,187 --> 00:18:31,348
How long have they known?
Long enough.

229
00:18:31,456 --> 00:18:34,482
But that doesn't matter now.
Matters to me.

230
00:18:35,093 --> 00:18:36,526
There are survivors
out there.

231
00:18:36,628 --> 00:18:39,461
This is not some
personal quest
I'm sending you on.

232
00:18:39,564 --> 00:18:43,193
Focus on your mission.
Who's behind it? Hatcher?

233
00:18:43,302 --> 00:18:48,035
Hatcher's got the swagger
and the smiles, but it's
Canaris who pulls the strings.

234
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:50,301
He's the power
behind the throne.

235
00:18:50,409 --> 00:18:52,843
And he's not someone
you want to pick
a fight with.

236
00:18:52,944 --> 00:18:55,276
Who, me?
I'm serious.

237
00:18:56,181 --> 00:18:59,742
If the truth got out,
it would bring Hatcher,
the government,

238
00:18:59,851 --> 00:19:02,217
the whole fucking
system down.

239
00:19:02,321 --> 00:19:06,018
And there's no way
Canaris is ever gonna
let that happen.

240
00:19:06,124 --> 00:19:09,423
Once you're over that wall,
there's no rules,

241
00:19:09,528 --> 00:19:11,996
no backup.
Better that way.

242
00:19:33,151 --> 00:19:35,551
Look after this for me,
would you?

243
00:19:46,431 --> 00:19:47,921
Don't suppose
you got a cigarette?

244
00:19:48,033 --> 00:19:51,491
There's no smoking
on the helicopter,
and I don't smoke.

245
00:19:51,603 --> 00:19:53,002
Fair enough.

246
00:19:53,872 --> 00:19:55,134
Dr. Marcus Kane,

247
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,641
he was leading
the research into the virus
when the gates were closed.

248
00:19:58,744 --> 00:20:00,735
He was trapped
inside the hot zone.

249
00:20:00,846 --> 00:20:04,680
His lab was located inside
the quarantine compound
in Glasgow.

250
00:20:05,317 --> 00:20:08,912
If anybody was capable
of developing a cure,
it was him.

251
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:12,888
I suggest you start
at the lab. Pick up
the trail from there.

252
00:20:14,493 --> 00:20:17,724
You'll rendezvous with
the rest of the team
at the wall,

253
00:20:17,829 --> 00:20:20,627
then you'll proceed north
in two armored transports.

254
00:20:20,732 --> 00:20:24,224
Scotland is still Why not fly in?
a no-fly zone.

255
00:20:24,336 --> 00:20:27,897
Hatcher needs to keep this
as low profile as possible.

256
00:20:28,006 --> 00:20:31,669
So if we don't make it out,
no one will know we went in.

257
00:20:32,511 --> 00:20:34,274
You've got 46 hours.

258
00:20:35,414 --> 00:20:39,214
If you don't make it back,
the city of London
and everybody in it

259
00:20:39,317 --> 00:20:41,308
will be left to die.

260
00:20:44,122 --> 00:20:46,113
If it's there,
I'll find it.

261
00:20:46,224 --> 00:20:51,161
You'll need this. It's a GPS
locator beacon. It'll tell us
exactly where you are.

262
00:20:52,864 --> 00:20:55,833
We'll have a gun ship
standing by to extract
your team.

263
00:20:55,934 --> 00:20:57,026
So much for low profile.

264
00:21:00,105 --> 00:21:03,233
Once you have the cure,
it won't matter.

265
00:21:06,178 --> 00:21:08,874
What happens if I don't
find anything up there?

266
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:11,813
Then you needn't
bother coming back.

267
00:21:26,498 --> 00:21:30,366
<i>MAN ON PA:

(PEOPLE CLAMORING)

271
00:21:47,169 --> 00:21:50,002
What the hell are we
going to do, Canaris?

272
00:21:50,372 --> 00:21:51,396
Just calm down
and listen.

273
00:21:53,226 --> 00:21:54,318
Even if,
by some miracle,

274
00:21:54,426 --> 00:21:57,623
Sinclair finds
what she's looking for
and makes it back in time,

275
00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:00,893
the fact remains,
this is our fault,
we made it happen.

276
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,436
Too many people crammed
into ghettos so tight
they can barely move.

277
00:22:04,536 --> 00:22:08,267
We created the perfect
breeding ground
for a virus to take place.

278
00:22:08,374 --> 00:22:09,671
And the more we save now,

279
00:22:09,775 --> 00:22:14,041
the more chance there is
of the same thing
happening all over again.

280
00:22:14,146 --> 00:22:18,446
Now, we have an opportunity
to buy ourselves
breathing room.

281
00:22:19,184 --> 00:22:23,644
What exactly are
you suggesting?
We're at war, Prime Minister.

282
00:22:24,456 --> 00:22:26,549
It's basic combat triage.

283
00:22:28,027 --> 00:22:29,927
Leave the dying to die.

284
00:22:30,429 --> 00:22:31,919
With the whole
world watching?

285
00:22:32,031 --> 00:22:36,900
With a lie this big,
we can get away with
anything we want.

286
00:22:57,823 --> 00:23:00,656
Major Sinclair!
Good flight?
Fine.

287
00:23:00,759 --> 00:23:03,421
Sergeant Norton.
Welcome to no-man's land.

288
00:23:03,529 --> 00:23:04,689
Why call it that?

289
00:23:04,797 --> 00:23:08,062
There's not another living
soul for miles south of
that wall, except us.

290
00:23:08,167 --> 00:23:09,429
What about
the sentries?

291
00:23:09,535 --> 00:23:12,561
No, the whole system
was fully automated
about 20 years ago.

292
00:23:12,671 --> 00:23:16,402
Nowadays they only
expend their ammo
on the local wildlife.

293
00:23:20,012 --> 00:23:24,642
A team arrived two hours
ago. They're prepping
their gear inside.

294
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:27,913
Ask them to get suited up,
Sergeant. We're against
the clock on this one.

295
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,282
Yes, sir!

296
00:23:30,289 --> 00:23:33,850
Has the team
been briefed?
I've given them
their assignments,

297
00:23:33,959 --> 00:23:36,154
objectives
and the file
on Dr. Kane.

298
00:23:36,261 --> 00:23:41,198
Major Sinclair.
Chandler. Armor division.
I'll be your driver today.

299
00:23:44,269 --> 00:23:46,362
Yeah, they may be ugly,
but they move like
shit off a shovel.

300
00:23:46,472 --> 00:23:48,702
Twin V12 engines,
two-inch armor plate,

301
00:23:48,807 --> 00:23:52,174
and they'll take anything
from 30mm rounds to
chemical weapons.

302
00:23:52,277 --> 00:23:54,871
Just the ticket for
a night on the town.
Where'd they
find these things?

303
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,845
READ: They patrolled
the hot zone, just
north of the wall.

304
00:23:56,949 --> 00:23:59,884
When the system was
automated, most of them
were sold off for scrap.

305
00:23:59,985 --> 00:24:01,247
These are the last
two in service.

306
00:24:01,353 --> 00:24:03,719

Miller, Carpenter.
BOTH: Major.

309
00:24:09,695 --> 00:24:10,684
What have we got here?

310
00:24:10,796 --> 00:24:14,527
CARPENTER: Bio suits.
Combat model. High impact
flexi-polymer.

311
00:24:14,633 --> 00:24:17,864
Gives us total
freedom of movement
and 24-hour protection.

312
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:19,870
Just what a girl needs.

00:24:20,205 --> 00:24:22,901
Prototype,
silicon foam grenade.

314
00:24:23,008 --> 00:24:25,772
This is frontline equipment.
NORTON: A going-away
present from Canaris.

315
00:24:27,312 --> 00:24:29,280
Are we expecting
trouble?

316
00:24:29,381 --> 00:24:31,440
Is there a problem?
No.

317
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:33,950
No problem at all, Major.

318
00:24:40,325 --> 00:24:41,553
Good.

319
00:24:45,964 --> 00:24:48,558
NORTON: This is our cargo,
Doctors Talbot
and Stirling.

320
00:24:48,667 --> 00:24:52,103
SINCLAIR: You were part
of the task force set up
to study the virus?

321
00:24:52,204 --> 00:24:54,798
That's right.
How do you do, Major?

322
00:24:54,907 --> 00:24:58,866
I took over in '24.
Stirling joined me in '31.

323
00:24:58,977 --> 00:25:01,070
Until Hatcher,
in his infinite wisdom,

324
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:04,946
decided to pull the plug
on the whole program
three years ago.

325
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:08,417
Tried everything, of course.
Just couldn't crack it.

326
00:25:12,041 --> 00:25:15,442
I do hope this trip of yours
is worth the risk, Major.

327
00:25:15,544 --> 00:25:17,705
Apparently, someone
thinks so.

328
00:25:20,616 --> 00:25:22,049
All right, listen up!

329
00:25:22,151 --> 00:25:26,281
I want everyone suited,
booted and strapped.
Back here in 10.

330
00:26:16,287 --> 00:26:17,754
