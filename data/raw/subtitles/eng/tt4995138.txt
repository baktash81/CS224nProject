he said
"let's get out of this town"

3
00:00:16,101 --> 00:00:19,700
drive out of this city,
away from the crowds

4
00:00:19,801 --> 00:00:23,000
i thought
"heaven can't help me now"

5
00:00:23,101 --> 00:00:27,600
nothing lasts forever,
but this is gonna take me down

6
00:00:27,701 --> 00:00:31,000
he's so tall
and handsome as hell

7
00:00:31,101 --> 00:00:34,200
he's so bad,
but he does it so well

8
00:00:34,301 --> 00:00:37,600
i can see the end
as it begins

9
00:00:37,601 --> 00:00:40,800
my one condition is:

10
00:00:40,901 --> 00:00:43,500
say you'll remember me

11
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:47,800
standing in a nice dress,
staring at the sunset, babe

12
00:00:47,901 --> 00:00:50,500
red lips
and rosy cheeks

13
00:00:50,501 --> 00:00:52,300
say you'll see me again,

14
00:00:52,301 --> 00:01:01,600
even if it's just in your
wildest dreams, ah, ah

15
00:01:01,601 --> 00:01:08,000
wildest dreams, ah, ah

16
00:01:11,401 --> 00:01:14,200
i said "no one has to know
what we do"

17
00:01:14,301 --> 00:01:18,200
his hands are in my hair,
his clothes are in my room

18
00:01:18,301 --> 00:01:21,300
and his voice
is a familiar sound

19
00:01:21,301 --> 00:01:23,600
nothing lasts forever,

20
00:01:23,701 --> 00:01:25,900
but this is getting good now

21
00:01:25,901 --> 00:01:29,200
he's so tall
and handsome as hell

22
00:01:29,301 --> 00:01:32,600
he's so bad,
but he does it so well

23
00:01:32,701 --> 00:01:35,700
and when we've had
our very last kiss,

24
00:01:35,701 --> 00:01:39,200
my last request, it is:

25
00:01:39,301 --> 00:01:41,800
say you'll remember me

26
00:01:41,801 --> 00:01:46,100
standing in a nice dress,
staring at the sunset, babe

27
00:01:46,201 --> 00:01:48,800
red lips
and rosy cheeks

28
00:01:48,801 --> 00:01:50,500
say you'll see me again,

29
00:01:50,501 --> 00:01:59,900
even if it's just in your
wildest dreams, ah, ah (ah, ah)

30
00:01:59,901 --> 00:02:06,500
wildest dreams, ah, ah

31
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:10,300
you'll see me in hindsight,
tangled up with you all night,

32
00:02:10,301 --> 00:02:13,500
burning it down

33
00:02:13,501 --> 00:02:17,200
someday when you leave me,
i bet these memories

34
00:02:17,201 --> 00:02:20,100

35
00:02:20,101 --> 00:02:24,000
you'll see me in hindsight,
tangled up with you all night,

36
00:02:24,001 --> 00:02:27,100
burning it down

37
00:02:27,101 --> 00:02:30,800
someday when you leave me,
i bet these memories

38
00:02:30,801 --> 00:02:33,900

39
00:02:34,001 --> 00:02:37,500
(follow you around)

40
00:02:37,601 --> 00:02:40,200

41
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:44,500
standing in a nice dress,
staring at the sunset, babe

42
00:02:44,601 --> 00:02:46,900
red lips
and rosy cheeks

43
00:02:47,001 --> 00:02:52,600

even if it's just pretend

44
00:02:53,001 --> 00:02:55,500
say you'll remember me

45
00:02:55,501 --> 00:02:59,700

wildest dreams, ah, ah
