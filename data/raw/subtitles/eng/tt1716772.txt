1
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,839
So, you see the thing is, Dad,
I could reapply next year,

2
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,319
but if I defer and try again for Oxford,
I'll probably lose my place at Bristol...

3
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,359
Mm...

4
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,119
...which is a good university,
but not my dream.

5
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,599
Do you think it matters in the long term,

6
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,039
or is the subject and standard of degree
more important?

7
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,519
So, I got married.

8
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,599
- What?!
- To Suzy, we got married.

9
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:33,679
You mean remarried.

10
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,519
This time it's for keeps, though.

11
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,359
- When did this happen?
- A few weeks ago.

12
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,799
I was going to invite you, but I know
how you are around people.

13
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,519
How am I?!

14
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,119
Awkward. Weird.

15
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,559
I don't live in a cave.
I live in suburban London.

16
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,279
I spend my entire life around people.

17
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,479
Much as I'd like to,
it's almost impossible to avoid them.

18
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,999
See, this is what I mean.

19
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,479
Well... Was it a big wedding?

20
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,119
No. Couple of hundred close friends
and family.

21
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,759
- And it was perfect.
- Mm.

22
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,679
I can't believe you didn't invite me
to your wedding.

23
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,919
So, what are you up to this summer?

24
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,199
Oh, you're changing the subject?

25
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,599
- Mm-hm.
- Fine.

26
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,879
I dunno. I guess I'll be going on holiday.

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,279
Oh, this should be good.
What have you got planned?

28
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,559
Trans-Siberian Express?
Fossil-hunting in Dorset?

29
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,319
Or maybe something even weirder.

30
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:23,719
No, actually. Something normal. I'm going
somewhere normal, with my normal friends,

31
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,079
to a place full of normal people.

32
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,399

that was me with my father.

And this is where I live - not with him,
but with my mother.

41
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,519
It's a long story. Well, not that long.

42
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,679
He shagged the work experience girl
and then left us.

43
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,399
So, just clichd, really.

44
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,359
Plus, it only happened two years ago,
so I don't even get the luxury

45
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,079
of blaming my various personality defects
on their divorce.

46
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,519
Anyway, that's how I ended up here -
the very definition of suburbia.

47
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:12,799
Safe, comforting, stifling, boring -
and I couldn't wait to fucking leave.

48
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:16,279
Maybe that's unfair, as they do say
that you never know what goes on

49
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,279
behind the net curtains of suburbia.

50
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,799

case, you can have a pretty good guess.

It's a bit over, is that OK?

Not really.

- Excuse me! My prawns?
- Sorry, mate, I finish at six.

74
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,519
Cheers for that.

- You don't have to thank me every time.
- Oh, right. Cool.

Oh, not talking!

What?

We're both going away to uni soon,

86
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,199
and it'll be too hard to keep it going
long-distance.

experienced only four years ago herself.

So the head of Sixth was going to say
a few inspirational words.

it wasn't lunatic giant Mr Gilbert.

next year,

114
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,319
and think it might be nice to pop in
and see how we're getting on,

115
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,799
don't. This isn't the Dead Poets Society

116

and I'm not that bloke on BBC Two
who keeps getting kids to sing in choirs.

117
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:04,879
I especially don't want to hear about
how well you're settling down at uni

118
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,319
or how much growing up you've done
in the past 12 months.

At best, I am ambivalent
towards most of you,

120
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,239
but some of you, I actively dislike,

121
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,399
for no other reason
than your poor personal hygiene

122
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,399
or your irritating personalities.

123
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,919
I hope I've made myself clear
on this point.

124
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,919
And in case any of you think
I'm joking...I'm not.

125

I assure you that once my legal obligation

00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,639
to look after your best interests
is removed,

Good luck with the rest of your lives
and...try not to kill anyone.

WILL: They say your school days
are the best days of your life.

But the only way that would be true for me

133
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,759
would be if I went straight from school
to prison and stayed there until I died.

How many times is that
she's caught you now?

- but, no, basically fine, thanks.
- Hi, Simon.

It's all right, mate. I understand.
Anyone would miss those tits.

00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,839
- It's not that, Neil.
- Is it her lovely snatch?

156
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,399
- No.
- I know it feels rough

157
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,199
now, Si,
but you just need to give it some time.

158

- NEIL: You were warned.
- How's that helping?!

00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,119
Stopped you from crying like a baby,

So my life is still ruined,
but now my balls ache too. Thanks, Jay(!)

No, your life is just about to begin,

Now you've been dumped, we can all go
on a mental holiday together.

Two weeks of sun, sea, sex, sand, booze,

169
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,799
sex, minge, fanny and tits.

00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,919
And booze.

171
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,399
And sex!

172
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,479
He's put it horrifically,
but he's probably right.

173
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,959
A holiday would definitely
take your mind off her.

174
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,839
JAY: Plus, it's the perfect time to go.

175
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,359
NEIL: Yeah, they say the summer is
the perfect time for a summer holiday.

176
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,399
WILL: Come on, Si, what do you say?
The lads on tour!

177
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,239
- NEIL: And you.
- WILL: Yes, and me! One of the lads.

178
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,479
Yeah, fuck it, go on, then.
Maybe it will help.

179
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,239
Course it will! And, I promise you, Si,

180
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,639
we'll go somewhere so full of fit birds,
it'll be like shooting clunge in a barrel.

181
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,679
What a lovely image(!)

182
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,159
WILL: So, that was it.
We were no longer schoolboys.

183
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,479
And, to prove our independence,

184
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,399
we were off on the holiday of a lifetime
without our parents...

185
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,999
after we'd made them pay for it.

186
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,039
I know this is the first time you've ever
been away from me, but don't go crazy.

187
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,199
When have I ever gone crazy?!

188
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,159
That time you drank all that shandy
at Debra's wedding. You went pretty wild!

189
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,519
- I was seven years old!
- He was running round, his pants down,

190
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,959
shouting, "I've got a white slug!"

191
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,279
- Mum!
- Oh, hello, Kevin!

192
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,879
Looks like just Jay
we're waiting for, then.

193
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,159
Yes, it does "look like" that, doesn't it?
God! Sorry about her.

194
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,559
Are you all right, Neil?
Your face is a bit weird.

195
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,959
Fine! Just popped a bit of my sister's
fake tan on, get it started, you know.

196
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,199
Just on your face?

197
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,479
Well... It's on my hands, now, too.

198
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,239
All right? Who's this, then, the vicar?

199
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,359
Me? No, no, I'm Kevin. I'm Neil's father.
Nice to meet you.

200
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,199
Where's Neil been hiding you, then?
The church? (LAUGHS)

201
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,759
- Looks like a bloody vicar, don't he?
- No, no, I'm not a vicar.

202
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,759
No, I know that. But you look like a vicar
and you talk like a vicar.

203
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,519
A bloody gay vicar, or something! (LAUGHS)

204
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,279
Well, I'm not a vicar and I'm not gay.

205
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,039
No, I'm saying you lookgay.

206
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,759
But you can't be, can you? Cos old
soppy bollocks here come out your pipe.

207
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:11,159
Right, I see.

208
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,399
Well, gotta get going.
Don't want you to miss that flight.

209
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,159
Bye-bye, Pookie Petal. Love you, mwah!

210
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,559
Oh, and Jay? If you're gonna spend
your grandad's money chasing skirt,

211
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,439
two things. One, make sure she's not
a hound like the last one.

212
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:29,559
And two, try to be a man when she dumps
you for someone with a bigger cock...

213
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,279
...which is everyone! (LAUGHS)

214
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,199
Dad!

215
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,199
WILL: Dads are like arseholes.
Everyone's got one, yes,

216
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,679
but also, they're arseholes. Which is why
they make excellent cab drivers.

217
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,879
Takes me back, all this -
cheap flights at ungodly hours.

218
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,399
Where is it you're headed to again?
Simon never tells me anything.

219
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,839
- Malia, Mr Cooper, in Greece.
- Can't say I've heard of it.

220
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,439
Of course you haven't,
it's a cool place to go.

221
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,919
And it's got a Subways.

222
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,999
Oh, right. In my day,
it was all about Spain.

223
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,159
Me and my mates went to Magaluf
this one time.

224
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,559
- Shagaluf, we called it!
- (NEIL LAUGHS)

225
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:02,319
Should've called it Shagalot. And hard.
Anything that moved.

226
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,079
We had a system.

227
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,159
Always left a hat on the bedroom door
when one of us got lucky.

228
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,639
Was usually me.

229
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,759
Oh, Dad, please shut up!

230
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,799
I don't know what it is,

231
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,279
but you'll find girls just seem to let
themselves go a bit more abroad.

232
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,199
It's like as soon as they smell
the sun cream, they get wet.

233
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:18,279
- Your mother's the same, even now.
- Oh, God, just drop us here!

234
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,359
WILL: I was learning a lot about holidays.

235
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,879
And not just what they did
to Mrs Cooper's front bottom.

236
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,079
I was also learning
that on a lads' holiday,

237
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,479
it's compulsory to wear
"hilarious" matching T-shirts.

238
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,039
Here y'are.

239
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,119
Nice!

240
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,639
Right, you owe me 12 quid each.
Except for you, Will, you owe me 20.

241
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,119
What?! Why?

242
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,919
Cos I had to bung the bloke
a few extra quid for him to make it.

243
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,599
Right, so I've got to pay more money
for a T-shirt I didn't ask for

244
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,919
and I'm not going to wear, cos it carries
a nickname I didn't know I had?

245
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,159
- Yes.
- Great(!)

246
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,719

# But do I care? Do I fuck!
I'm on a roll! Yo! #

256
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,639
Malia flight?

257
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,759
Yep.

258
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,999
Delay, seven hours.

259
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,519
And please remove those T-shirts,
or we won't allow you to board the plane.

260
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:37,439
WILL: Despite Neil offering - twice -
they didn't let him drive the plane.

261
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:40,079
Finally, though, we'd made it on holiday,

262
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,519
and Jay's thoughts on the beautiful isle
of Crete, birthplace of Zeus,

263
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,039
were as insightful as ever.

264
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,999
- I'm hot.
- It is well hot.

265
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,519
- Might be too hot.
- Might be.

Oh.

270
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,319

Didn't you see them girls?

276
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,959
Why don't you chirps 'em?

277
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,719
- I can't handle that many at once, Neil.
- Really? What about that netball team?

278
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,959
Yeah, that was all right,
cos that was a luxury caravan.

279
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,479
But this coach is way too small
for my moves.

280
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,959
Ah, course.

281
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,559
Right, so, the plan is
get to the apartment, unpack,

282
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,199
get some sleep,
then head out fresh tomorrow.

283
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,879
First up, the Minoan Palace at Knossos.

284

JAY: Have you come on a lads' holiday
by mistake?!

285
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,279
We haven't come halfway round the world to
look at some boring fucking Greek ruins.

286
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,199
Yeah, you can see that shit anywhere.

287
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,919
We go there, drop the bags off,
then go straight out and get spasticated.

288
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,119
Simples.

289
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,839
But I've not slept for 37 hours.

290
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,919
Shut up and try and get
some sleep on here, then.

291
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,679

are better than this shithole.

00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,759
I couldn't help thinking
a shit on the floor

333
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,159
might have
cheered the place up a bit.

334
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,479
- JAY AND NEIL: Shotgun this room!
- Shotgun the sofa bed!

335
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,799
Well, where am I gonna sleep then?!

336
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,439
Not really my problem.

337
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,399
What's that? Is that the bath?

338
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:14,759
Course it's not the bath,
you fucking idiot. There's the bath!

339
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,399
That's the...kids' toilet.

340
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,599
- Is it?
- Yes!

341
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,519
Why's it got a plughole and a tap, then?

342
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,759
Cos it's for checking your kid's shit
before you flush it.

343
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,479
- Urgh, that's grim!
- Yeah, I know.

344
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,719
That's the Continentals, innit?
They're dirty.

345
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,839
See? That looks nice!

346
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,519
I'm not sleeping in a fucking bathtub
for two weeks, Simon!

347
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,879
We'll have to share the sofa bed.

348
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,079
(HIGH-PITCHED) Ooh, 'ello!

349
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,919
Right, well, while you two decide
who gets first go on each other's cocks,

350
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,359
I'm getting ready and getting out there.

351
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,959
The gash isn't gonna fuck itself,
you know.

352
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,999
Charming(!)

353
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,759
(JAY SCREAMS)

354
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:18,999
WILL: Finally, smelling like an industrial
accident at the Lynx factory,

355
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:22,439
and looking like the world's
shittest boy band, we hit the town.

356
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,479
- Ooh, heads down, boys.
- NEIL: Shit.

357
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,359
What? Why? We haven't done anything!

358
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,399
- Foreign police, innit?
- So?

359
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,959
Don't you even know about foreign police?

360
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,879
What, short-sleeved uniforms?
Chunkier truncheons?

361
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,519
- Oh, fucking hell!
- Mate, they're all corrupt.

362
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,959
Basically, if you misbehave
and don't have the money to bribe 'em,

363
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,519
they take you up
to these shepherds' huts in the hills

364
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,279
beat you up and bum ya.

365
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,999
And if they don't kill ya,
you kill yourself,

366
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,359
cos of the shame of getting a boner
whilst you was being bummed.

367
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,239
Right, couple of things. Firstly,
the hills here are full of timeshares,

368
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,559
not deserted shepherds' huts.

369
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,519
Secondly, Crete's in the EU,
so I think the standard of policing

370
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,599
probably goes beyond bumming
and forced suicide.

371
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,719
Believe what you want. I'm keeping
a bribe up my arse just in case.

372
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,959
You're gonna spend the whole holiday with
20 euros rolled up inside your arsehole?

373
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,319
It's been up there since
the seatbelt signs went off, mate.

374
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,119
All right, lads! Holiday, is it? I'm out
here on my own, having a mental time!

375
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,919
Can I have a beer?

376
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,999
- Oh, here you go, mate.
- No, you can't!

377
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,039
All right, which is it?
You say yes, he says bloody no.

378
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:20,159
- He's not your boss, is he? Eh?
- Sorry... Do we know you?

379
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,119
Anyways, here's a good one for you, right.

380
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,879
Get a torch and walk along the beach at
night and you get to watch people fucking.

381
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,839
They're all drunk and you get to see
tits and cocks and that.

382
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,359
If you're into cocks.
Which it looks like he is! Ha-ha!

383
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,799
Well, it's been great talking to you,
but we've really got to get a move on.

384
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,279
Can I come round yours for a shower?

385
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,839
Um, no.

386
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,279
No? Cool beans. See you later, lads!

387
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,799
Richard, yeah? Richard!

388
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,959
WILL: Well, Richard was clearly mental.

389
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,759
But, as we were about to discover,
so was everything else here.

390
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,439
# This place about to blow

391
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,919
# Blow

392
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:01,799
# This place about to blow

393
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,719
# Blow

394
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,879
# This place about to blow

395
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,239
# This place about to blow... #

396
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:35,039
WILL: While Simon was seeing Carli
everywhere,

397
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:38,199
- Jay was seeing some very lucky ladies.
- She'd get it.

398
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,879
NEIL: Most definitely!

399
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,319
Oh, and that one. She'd get it!

400
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,679
- And that one! And that one.
- And that one. She'd get it.

401
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,039
Right in the bumholey.

402
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,159
I can't believe I've already got a bird.
Gutted.

403
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:52,679
So fucking what?! All birds know -
what goes on tour stays on tour.

404
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,039
No, I couldn't do that to Nicole.
I think I love her.

405
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,039
And I never loved anything before
apart from a car or a sandwich.

406
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,559
If the build-up gets too much for you, you
can always borrow one of my johnnies,

407
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,119
have a wank royale.

408
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,799
- Oh, cheers, Jay!
- A what?!

409
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,239
A wank royale. A wank with a johnny on.
It's a bit more expensive,

410
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,839
so I tend to save it
for special occasions.

411
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,719
Birthdays, Christmas,
the Champions League final...

412
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,719
All right, lads!
Are you up for a good time?

413
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,119
Yeah, we're always up for a good time.

414
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,479
We're the Pussay Patrol.

415
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,039
All right. Well, if you really are
the Pussay Patrol...

416
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,839
- Which we are.
- You're obviously going to Marco's.

417
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,079
It's the most buzzing bar out here. Always
packed with a chilled-out, sexy vibe.

418
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,279
- Know what I mean?
- I don't really know what you mean.

419
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,519
When you say "sexy vibe",
do you mean girls?

420
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,639
Course! Loads of girls.

421
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,959
I'll sort you out half-price drinks
and a free fishbowl.

422
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,479
Cool, cool, cool.

423
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,679
So, will you be in there,
with your sexiness,

424
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:39,439
making the vibe all...sexy?
Being all sexy, and that, sexy?

425
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,879
Say "sexy" more.

426
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,159
Well, I will be if you're gonna be there,
you saucy bugger!

427
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,359
Come on, then!

428
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,999
Here you go, these four. I'll see you
in a bit. Mine's a Bacardi and Coke.

429
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,199
Large one?

430
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,479
Saucy! See you later.

431
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,119
Fucking hell, you're well in there, mate!

432
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:58,799
Yep! He shoots, he scores.
Right up the vag.

433
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,119
Oh, my God, if she's outside,
imagine the birds inside!

434
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,839
Ah. Interesting.

435
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,719
Well, it must get going a bit later.
She did say it was amazing.

436
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,879
And why would she lie?!

437
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:22,439
All right, mate. Four pints, four
Jgermeisters and a fishbowl, please.

438
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,599
Hello.

439
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,679
- When it good here?
- Sorry?

440
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,679
Er, when here party good?

441
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,919
Normally about an hour or two?

442
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,159
Oh. Well, as we've paid,
maybe we should hang on, then?

443
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,639
But this year...never.

444
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,679
Thanking you, very much.

445
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,719
OK, let's go.

446
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,439
Fuck off! My bird'll be down in a minute.

447
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,519
You mean the woman who's clearly
on commission to trick people

448
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,559
into this empty bar?

449
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,279
No, I mean the little hottie outside
that I was flirting with.

450
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,359
I'll take that as a yes, then.

451
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,039
I'm going nowhere
till she's sucked me off!

452
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,679
- So, you're going nowhere.
- WILL: Jay, we're on holiday!

453
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,399
I'm meant to be out there, trying to
hit on girls that I think are beneath me,

454
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,999
but who, for their part, won't give me
the time of day! So, let's go!

455
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,759
Ooh! Hello, hello!
It's those little lovelies from the coach!

456
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,959
- That one's not so little.
- I think they're looking at us.

457
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,559
And not in a weird, terrified,
"leave us alone" way. Amazing!

458
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,039
Jay, you're drunkest.
Go over and talk to them.

459
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,999
Nah, not me, mate.
None of them are as fit as my one outside.

460
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,719
Why go for hamburgers,
when you've got steak at home?

461
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,479
If, like you, you have neither anywhere.

462
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,999
It's up to you, then, Si.

463
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,479
Shit, really?
I don't know if I'm over Carli.

464
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,999
Ow! Fuck! Can you stop that?!

465
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:23,119
Yes, I can. When you stop being
such a pussy about your ex.

466
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,239
It's time to get back
on the horse now, Si.

467
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,919
And those little ponies need feeding.

468
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,719
Feed the pony.

469
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,919
Yeah, OK, I'll introduce us,
but we've all got to go over together.

470
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,399
- Great.
- You fucking sad cases.

471
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,239
You don't just walk up to a girl in a club
and introduce yourself! That's creepy.

472
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,999
Clubs are different rules, you dick.

473
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,799
Look, you dance over near them, make
the eyes, then get 'em to dance with you.

474
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,919
Really?!

475
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,199
- Annoyingly, that does sound right.
- Thank you!

476
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,279
And then, after a bit,
you stand up behind them,

477
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,239
pretend to slap 'em
and fuck 'em up the arse.

478
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,159
- That might be a bit much.
- Yeah, I dunno...

479
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,999
Oh, fucking hell, I'll do it.

480
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,319
- What about Nicole?
- It's only dancing, she likes my dancing.

481
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,999
Stick with me, you'll be fine.

482
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:03,599
Right, then, Si.
Looks like the holiday starts here.

483
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:07,679
(# YOLANDA BE COOL:
We No Speak Americano)

484
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,519
Am I doing it right? Am I in time?

485
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,399
Maybe a bit out, but not so you'd notice.
Copy Neil.

486
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,479
Sorry. Do you mind
if we come and talk to you?

487
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,479
Cos you look nice and, frankly, this is
just humiliating for everyone involved.

488
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,599
Um...

489
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,599
Sit down, Specs.

490
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,359
Hello. I'm Lucy.

491
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,839
Hi, I'm Diamond... Simon! I'm Simon.

492
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,839
I'd better not get stuck with the fat one.

493
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:31,519
So, when Alison initially suggested Malia,
we all thought, yeah, why not?

494
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,759
It'll be ironic.
Then we had a reality check

495
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,519
and we thought, do we honestly wanna spend
two weeks somewhere being ironic,

496
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,439
and obviously the answer was no,
so then we looked at other places,

497
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:44,519
but we realised, actually, we just want to
have a laugh and go clubbing and get drunk

498
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,839
and be silly, and that this might
genuinely be a good place to come,

499
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,079
so fuck it, here we are.

500
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,519
Just so you know, I've met a really
fit bird and she'll be along any minute.

501
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,199
OK. She won't mind you talking to me,
then, will she?

502
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,799
WILL: If our dancing was bad -
and it was bad...

503
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,479
then our small talk was even worse.

504
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,599
Sorry, will you excuse us a moment?

505
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,079
- What's going on?
- What do you mean?!

506
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,039
What do you think I mean?!
Why aren't you talking to the girls?

507
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,879
I get, like, words making sounds
in my head, but they don't come out.

508
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,519
Well, that's easy to fix. Just say them!
Move your mouth and say them!

509
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,639
Well, I can't pork any of them anyways,
cos of Nicole.

510
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,279
But it would be nice to make a connection,

511
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,759
like on them TV shows,
when people make a connection.

512
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,759
Oh, this is hopeless.

513
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,279
Well, I don't exactly see you
charming your way into their knickers.

514
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,959
I just danced for the first time
in my life!

515
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,119
It's hard to know what to follow up with.

516
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,799
Maybe you could pretend to not have
the personality you've got.

517
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,919
Like...pretend to be someone cool.

518
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,839
Thanks, Simon. Thank you. Big help(!)

519
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,399
Yeah. Actually,
it's probably best you don't even try.

520
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:53,399
No, I am going to try.
If anything, I'm gonna try too hard.

521
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,719
She is well out of your league.

522
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,919
Like well, well, well out of your league.

523
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:59,039
So? All girls I like are out of my league.

524
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,839
What's the point of going for girls
in my league?

525
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,719
Look at me! Imagine my league!

526
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,879
Oh, God.

527
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,959
Er, Jay, mate?
I think you missed the toilet.

528
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,519
Are you saying I can't hold my drink?

529
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,039
You are pissing your drink
all over the floor.

530
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:23,599
So? It's still the toilet.
This whole room's the toilet.

531
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:27,479
Neil? Can you chuck me a paper towel?

532
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,519
Ah! Wipe the drip from my knob.

533
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,359
Birds don't like it when it tastes pissy.

534
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,159
OK, come on, guys. We've done
the hard bit. Let's not fuck this up.

535
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,639
I just can't think of what to say!

536
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,199
Just talk about something you love.
Something you're passionate about.

537
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:48,639
Right. Oh, cool. Got it.
I know exactly what to say.

538
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,679
It's pretty devastating,

539
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,639
cos she's definitely
the most beautiful girl I've ever met.

540
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,519
She's so fascinating.
She's really funny, you know?

541
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,039
Oh, right. In what sort of way?

542
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,079
Just like... You know when something's
funny and people get it?

543
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,439
Yes.

544
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:03,359
So, in that way.
And, also, in a comedy way.

545
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:09,599
WILL: Neil was a man of few words,
but even for him, this was ridiculous.

546
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,119
Not that I was faring
that much better myself.

547
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:18,559
So, do this place hire you out as
some sort of avant-garde dance troupe

548
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,919
to scare the customers off?

549
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,919
No. I lost my mind and agreed to come here
on holiday. What's your excuse?

550
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,319
Sort of similar.

551
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:27,039
I came out here earlier this summer and
fell crazy in love with a gorgeous local,

552
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,719
- so now I'm back.
- Hilarious. Course you did.

553
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,119
What was he, a barman or a waiter?

554
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,479
- Waiter.
- Brilliant. Was he called Stavros?

555
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,439
- Nicos.
- Too good.

556
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,679
I bet he's different to all the boys
back home!

557
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,119
Yeah. He understands women, for one.

558
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,839
I'm sure he does.
Must get enough practice.

559
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,279
WILL: Not only had Jay not offered
to buy Jane a drink,

560
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,519
he'd now stopped paying for his own.

561
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,719
Meanwhile, Simon was on a roll.

562
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,839
So then Carli said we needed some space.
And uni's coming up,

563
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,599
- so maybe she's right.
- Sorry, who's right?

564
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,719
- Carli?
- Who?

565
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:55,759
Carli, my ex?

566
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:59,359
You went out with a girl called Carli?
You should've said(!)

567
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,239
What? I did!
That's all I've been talking about.

568
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,279
Oh!

569
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,319
Yes, I was joking!

570
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:09,439
Sorry for going on about her. I usually
get a smack in the balls to stop me.

571
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,599
What?!

572
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,879
Um, nothing.

573
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,439
WILL: Meanwhile,
Neil had a trump card to play.

574
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,639
Do you want to dance?

575
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,359
WILL: Meanwhile,
Alison didn't seem to be enjoying

576
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,999
my hilarious Greek waiter impression.

577
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:35,399
So, I presume he wooed you with the old,
"Hh'I love you, hh'I love you!

578
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:39,479
"You hh'only girl for me!
There's no hh'other girl hh'in my life!

579
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,999
"Oh, wait, here comes the next plane
from Newcastle. I've gotta go, baby."

580
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,719
Sorry, you do realise
I'm not playing along with the joke.

581
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:47,519
I do genuinely have a Greek waiter
boyfriend called Nicos.

582
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,879
No, of course you do.

583
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,599
Brilliant. Nicos.
You've really nailed the clichs.

584
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,039
- You are joking, aren't you?
- No.

585
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:04,639
His grandmother has a moustache as well,
if that makes the stereotype even funnier.

586
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:07,879
I'm sorry. I'm sure he's not like
every other waiter out here.

587
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,679
It's fine. You don't know
what you're talking about.

588
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,799
Your accent was pretty good, though.

589
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:15,079
Oh, I've gotta go. Don't want to miss
my stereotypical Greek boyfriend.

590
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,439
He might get angry and smash some plates.

591
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,559
Or commit atrocities in Anatolia.

592
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,079
You're not normal, are you?

593
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,279
You all right, Lise?
Where's that bloke you were dancing with?

594
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:36,079
# I've got nothing but love for you

595
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:39,039
# I've got nothing but love for you... #

596
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,759
Luce, we should go. Nicos finishes soon,
and I don't want to miss him.

597
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,679
So, shall we all hang out again sometime?

598
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,559
Yeah. You lot don't seem too bad.

599
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:51,319
If I hear another bloke out here
refer to women as "gash", I'll scream.

600
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:56,439
- Yeah. No, that is horrible. Really bad.
- It's awful when men do that. Disgusting.

601
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:59,239
Do you fancy coming to the all-day
boat party, Friday?

602
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,599
I know it's meant to be sold out, but
our rep reckons he can still get tickets.

603
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,319
All-day boat party - what's that?

604
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,999
Well, it's a party.

605
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,199
OK.

606
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,119
- All day.
- Yep.

607
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,719
- On a boat.
- Oh, right.

608
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,679
Well! Now that's been cleared up,
we should go.

609
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,279
See you later, Will.

610
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,359
Amazing.

611
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,439
Do you realise, we just danced over,
chatted up some girls,

612
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,119
they loved it and you didn't fuck it up!

613
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,759
- Me?!
- Are we players?

614
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,679
I'm starting to think that here, unlike
at home, we might actually be players.

615
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,519
Maybe. I'm not really sure
what that means.

616
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,999
However, cos I've not slept now
for two days, I'm going to bed.

617
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,399
Yeah. My eyeballs feel like
they've got paper cuts.

618
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,879
- Jay, are you coming?
- Fuck that!

619
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,719
There's a fit bird up there
who's so wet for me,

620
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,399
I can hear the waves breaking
in her fanny.

621
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,519
I'm gonna down this, then take her down
the beach and fuck her brains out.

622
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,959
Right, well, we've established
that isn't happening.

623
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,879
Fine. Watch me.

624
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,519
Mm. Classy(!)

625
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,359
We'd better get Neil.

626
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:04,879
- Neil...?
- Oh, God! We're off.

627
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,479
Right. Won't be a minute,
I'll just finish up here.

628
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,239
Christ, Neil, what about Nicole?

629
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,879
Oh, she won't mind, we're not kissing.

630
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,679
Nah. It's just fingers, in't it, lover?

631
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,039
Right.

632
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,879
Yeah. I'll catch you lot up. One second.

633
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,719
He's definitely picked up the pace.

634
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,759
WILL: While Neil picked up
his finger-banging speed,

635
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,919
we picked up Jay - and he had
a chilling prediction to share with us.

636
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:27,559
She's gonna suck my knob-knob dry.
You watch.

637
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,759
I'd rather not watch,
if it's all the same to you.

638
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,159
Shit, is that Carli?

639
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,599
Look, Si, it's normal
that after a break-up,

640
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:36,679
you'll think you see her everywhere,
but she's not here.

641
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,159
Yeah. I suppose.

642
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:40,079
- Could be her.
- What?

643
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,919
Could be her.
She is out here at the moment.

644
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,119
What?!

645
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,239
Well, we weren't sure where
the best place to go was,

646
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,719
and her and her mates are pretty cool,
so I asked them where they was going

647
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,039
and when, and that's why I booked Malia.

648
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,479
You fucking idiot!
I came away to try and get over her!

649
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,399
- Did ya?
- You know I did!

650
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,879
Oh, yeah, course.

651
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,319
Oh, God, look at her.

652
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,559
Do you think this is fate?
Her being here, me being here.

653
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,159
No. I think Neil asked her
where she was going

654
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,919
and then booked the same place,
like he just said.

655
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,399
Let's go before she sees us!

656
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,839
No, no. I've got to go and talk to her.

657
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,519
If there's even the slightest chance
of us getting back together,

658
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,639
I've got to take it.

659
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,159
Carli!

660
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,279
Carli?

661
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,319
Simon?!

662
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,799
Oh, my God! What are you doing here?

663
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,319
Stalking you abroad.

664
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,759
No. The opposite, actually.
Just a mix-up by my friends.

665
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,919
My stupid fucking idiot friends.

666
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,719
Well, whatever. It's great to see you.

667
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,919
Is it?!

668
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,279
Yeah, it is. Course.

669
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,399
Course.

670
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:33,839
So, as we're here, why don't we hang out?
How about right now?

671
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:37,359
Now? Oh, I can't now. But you'll be
at the boat party on Friday, right?

672
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:40,879
The boat party? I was literally
just talking about the boat party.

673
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,079
It's gonna be amazing. The best way
to round off our holiday.

674
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,839
What? Why are you going? Don't go.

675
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,759
I've got to go.
My flight leaves on Saturday.

676
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,639
The boat's our last chance to party.

677
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,759
Right. Well, I'll definitely be there,
then.

678
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,639
For total, one million per cent.
Definitely.

679
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,559
Cool. It'll be great to hang out again.

680
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,959
- I've missed you.
- Hmm?

681
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,559
Argh, Jesus!

682
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,799
- Fuck it!
- Sorry, mate.

683
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:05,799
- James! Are you all right, Simon?
- (WHIMPERS) Yeah, fine. Argh!

684
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,559
I'll walk it off.

685
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,759
Cool, yeah. Carls, come on,
we've gotta go.

686
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,119
Oh, do you two know each other?

687
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,279
Yeah, James is our rep.

688
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:16,439
Rep, unofficial rep. I sort out club
nights. A bit of party organising, PR...

689
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:19,879
Just make sure everyone's having
a good time, you know what I mean?

690
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,439
- Are you sure you're all right, mate?
- All good...

691
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,559
Cool. Carls, come on.

692
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,959
Bye, Simon. See you on the boat.

693
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,679
See you, mate. Mind that leg.

694
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,119
I'll sort you out a free fishbowl.

695
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,399
Oi, baby, you stood me up!

696
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,519
Ah, didn't wait long enough, sweetheart.

697
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,879
Come on, kiss me.

698
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,159
I'm working, darling.

699
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,959
I love your boobs.

700
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,119
What?!

701
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,999
What gives you the right to touch me,
you fucking prick?

702
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,039
Wha...?

703
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,039
Sorry, I think he might've had
a little too much of the old drink.

704
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,959
I am sick of every dickhead
thinking he's got touching rights,

705
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:57,519
just cos I smiled at him.
It's my fucking job, you cretin!

706
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,679
Are you on the blob?

707
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,519
Sexy. I like it.

708
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,719
- No, Jay. Time for bed.
- Fuck that!

709
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:08,119
You two can bum yourselves to death
on the sofa bed.

710
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:10,199
I'm going to get another drink.

711
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,119
Jay, don't be insane.
You're too drunk already.

712
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:15,039
I'm on fucking holiday.
You can't be too drunk!

713
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:17,799
- You coming, Neil?
- Nah, I like it in there.

714
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:21,439
And not sleeping for two nights is pretty
much the same as not sleeping for one.

715
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,559
Right, fine. Fucking knobheads.

716
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,559
How was your chat?

717
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:29,319
Amazing. Carli is here, Will. That's what
she was worried about, us being apart.

718
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,039
That's why we split up.

719
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,559
But we're not apart,
because we're both here.

720
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,079
I just need to get on that boat.

721
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,999
Actually, can one of youse help me?
I think she might be a two-man job.

722
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,239
What happened to your leg?

723
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,639
- Oh, I got a little bit run over.
- "A little bit run over"?!

724
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,959
(WHOOPING)

725
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,239
WILL: The next morning, I was woken up

726
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:57,919
by what sounded like
Bigfoot having an asthma attack.

727
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,359
(WHOOPING)

728
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,479
Simon...

729
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,079
Simon!

730
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,559
Christ, it's like a sauna in here.

731
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,319
Have you got any water?

732
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,839
(WHOOPING CONTINUES)

733
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,679
What the fuck is that noise?

734
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,239
I think it's Neil.

735
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,639
Oh, no, not the dinner lady
from last night!

736
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:17,079
NEIL: I cannot understand a thing you say.

737
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,239
WOMAN: Spunk all over me bastard tits.

738
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,679
Well, it's her or Johnny Vegas.

739
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:25,479
WOMAN: Fucking smack it!
Smack it, you little prick!

740
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,759
- WOMAN: Is that all you've got?
- NEIL: Shall I bite it?

741
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:28,799
Interesting question.

742
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,639
This is beyond creepy.

743
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,519
WOMAN: Twist it right fookin' off!

744
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,159
OK, I'm getting out of here!

745
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,039
WOMAN: Harder!

746
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,679
How can I have spent 100 euros?

747
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,559
Holy shit, I only budgeted 15 euros a day!

748
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,439
Great, so I spunked all my money

749
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,799
- in one night.
- All right!

750
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:46,839
Oh, Jesus, Neil!

751
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,159
Oh, don't worry about that.
It's on the way down. Have you seen Jay?

752
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,479
Shit, no. Not since last night.

753
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,839
No, I mean, have you seen him?
He's over there.

754
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:02,239
(GROANS)

755
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:06,079
WILL: So Jay had slept
face down in the dirt.

756
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,479
But I'd woken up listening to Neil
getting sucked off.

757
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,639
As far as I was concerned, he won.

758
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,599
Urgh, ohhh!

759
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,279
Face...!

760
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,919
Yeah, you've got something on your face.

761
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,559
It appears Jay's slept in an ants' nest.

762
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,279
Argh! Pain!

763
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,319
Tongue...

764
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:34,599
It's all right, boys. Kitty don't bite.
Not now she's been fed.

765
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,679
Hey, lover?

766
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,039
What the fuck was that?!

767
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,279
WILL: I'll tell you what does bite,
though. Ants.

768
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,119
...86, 87, 88.

769
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,439
88 fucking bites.

770
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:54,519
Ooh, sorry. I asked for two poached eggs?

771
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,039
Is poached, look.

772
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:59,719
No, this is fried. And "an egg", singular.

773
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:02,399
Yes, poached. I promise with all my heart.

774
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:06,679
So, you're promising me, with all
your heart, that this is two poached eggs?

775
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,399
Yes. Burger?

776
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,079
Oh, that's mine.

777
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,279
Oi, I'm starving!
Where's my bacon sandwich?

778
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,959
I thought you'd have eaten enough pig
last night...

779
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,999
- Mate, what were you thinking?!
- I dunno.

780
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,839
She was saying all this dirty stuff
and she looked a bit like Will's mum.

781
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,839
- So I thought, why not?
- She did not look like my mum, Neil.

782
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,039
- She did a bit.
- No, she did not.

783
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,919
Bet she did when she had his cock
in her mouth.

784
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,039
- Brilliant(!)
- Don't you feel bad about Nicole?

785
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,639
- Who?
- The girlfriend you just cheated on?

786
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,919
Oh, no, no, cos only the tip went in.

787
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,119
Any more than the tip is cheating, and I
would never do that, cos I've got ethics.

788
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:39,199
- Right... Well, see you lot later.
- Where are you going?

789
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,319
I'm going to find those girls.
They should be at the hotel.

790
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,239
Lucy said her rep could still get
boat party tickets.

791
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,279
Oh, wow. That's an interesting story(!)

792
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:49,079
Well, it is, actually, because guess
who's going to be there - Carli.

793
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,199
Ow!

794
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,759
Look, she invited me to the party.
She said she missed me.

795
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,319
There's got to be a chance she's...

796
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,639
On all fours, sucking that bloke off?

797
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:59,199
No, she wants us to get back together.
What bloke?

798
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,319
Look, you're meant to be here
to forget about Carli.

799
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,599
Argh!

800
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,919
- Not me, Neil!
- I'll help you find them, Si.

801
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,759
They were fun. It'll be good
to see them again. Alison was nice.

802
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:11,759
Fine, fuck it. I'll help.
Shouldn't be too hard to find.

803
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,039
Probably spot the lard arse
I got stuck with from outer space.

804
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,879
- Neil?
- Can't,

805
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,359
had a nightmare.
I left my trunks in England.

806
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,599
Just wear your Calvins, mate.
They're practically the same.

807
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:22,279
- Can I, Will?
- Um, yeah, I suppose.

808
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,359
- And can I bring a ball?
- Yes, Neil. Yes, you can.

809
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:31,039
WILL: Unsurprisingly, the girls' hotel
was nicer than our hotel.

810
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:34,399
There are North Korean prison camps
which are nicer than our hotel.

811
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:37,799
But, like a North Korean prison camp, it
was overcrowded, so we had nowhere to sit.

812
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,239
- What about there?
- They've got towels on them, Neil.

813
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,399
- So?
- That means people have bagsied them.

814
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,199
- We can't take those.
- Fuck that!

815
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:47,239
- No, Jay, we can't!
- Watch me!

816
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,599
It's probably just a load of Krauts

817
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,479
that got down early in the morning
to reserve 'em.

818
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,199
That towel's got Finding Nemo on it.

819
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,479
What, so Nazis can't like Disney too?

820
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:58,839
- Jay!
- Besides, I really need a lie down.

821
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,119
My head's more fucked
than Neil's dad's arsehole.

822
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,479
Jay, please!

823
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,239
WILL: Jay and Neil were off to,

824
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,679
as they put it,
"check out the chicas".

825
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,399
But I had a serious problem.

826
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,679
In the absence of my mother, or a teacher,

827
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,439
I needed help with my sunblock.

828
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,759
Simon, will you do my back?

829
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,599
- No.
- No?!

830
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,559
- I don't want to touch you.
- Unbelievable.

831
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,039
Fine, I'll do it myself.

832
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,519
Look all right,
I'll do it with one finger.

833
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,239
Thank you.

834
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:34,959
You've got too much here.
And here. I'll scrape it off.

835
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,759
OK, but don't try and be funny and draw
a cock on my back or something.

836
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,159
No, course not.

837
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,959
Right, all done.

838
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,159
See, that wasn't so bad, was it?

839
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,479
No, that was fine.

840
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,719
WILL: I was really enjoying my book,

841
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:53,319
blissfully unaware of the crudely drawn
phallus burning itself onto my skin.

842
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:56,399
Meanwhile, Jay was having trouble
with his emergency funds.

843
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:59,399
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, it's just that 20 euros.

844
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,719
Ay-oh, Jay, here we go,
we've been spotted.

845
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,079
Seen 'em.

846
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,239
Look cool.

847
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,919
(LAUGHS) Manchester.

848
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:15,959
Manchester!

849
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,199
- Who's this little twat?
- You from Manchester?

850
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,279
You like Manchester?

851
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,479
- Yeah, yeah. Near Manchester.
- No, you aren't.

852
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,559
Shut up, Neil,
the birds are loving it.

853
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:27,559
- Goal!
- (LAUGHS) Goal!

854
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:30,079
Goal to Manchester! Yeah!

855
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,439
No. Manchester, down.

856
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,759
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

857
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,759
Yeah, hilarious.
Now, get out the way.

858
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:38,879
Whoa!

859
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,479
(LAUGHTER)

860
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,959
Right. You're fucking dead,
you little shit!

861
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,519
Mate, just leave it,
the chicas are looking, just laugh it off.

862
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,239
(FORCED LAUGHING)

863
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,759
No, I'm fine for drinks, thanks.

864
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:14,959
(CLEARS THROAT)

865
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:17,239
Oh! Alison. Hello!

866
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:20,559
Hello. You know you've got
a spunking cock on your back?

867
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,119
What?

868
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,799
Oh, no. Thanks, Simon,

869
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,119
very funny, very mature. So I've been
lying here with a cock on my back, have I?

870
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,759
Not for the first time.

871
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:31,279
I'll burn a muff on my tit if it makes
you feel less self-conscious.

872
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,799
It would, actually.
We'd make quite the pair.

873
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,799
You've got a really good spot here.

874
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,519
Yes, Jay, um...sort of, um...

875
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,399
Did he use some of his boyish charm?

876
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,879
In a way, yes.

877
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,919
I think I might start drinking again.
Anyone fancy joining me?

878
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,319
Um, yes, I will!

879
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:45,559
Oh.

880
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:48,119
Lucky me(!)

881
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,039
Oh, I'm knackered.

882
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:55,239
- Fishbowl hangover?
- No. Nicos was over last night.

883
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:57,079
Does not stop talking.

884
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,759
No, we were having sex.

885
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,599
Right.

886
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,599
Sorry, does it make you uncomfortable
when I mention sex?

887
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:07,159
No! No, it's good,
it's great that you're so...

888
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,639
sexually active.

889
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:11,399
Yeah, I suppose it is.

890
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:15,719
- What's the best sex you've had, Will?
- Well, um...hard to say, really.

891
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,039
Come on, you can tell me.

892
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,119
Oh! I don't like to sex and tell.

893
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,959
Don't be boring, just tell me.

894
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,959
Look, I'm going to level with you,

895
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:26,879
I have never...put my penis in a lady.

896
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,039
That's all right, you're a virgin,
that's cool.

897
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:31,639
It's definitely not cool.
If anything, it's famously uncool.

898
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:32,719
Well, it's cute, then.

899
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,239
Oh, God, that's even worse.

900
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,919
- You're funny, Will.
- Well, that's something.

901
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,879
Can I get a girl into bed for sex
just by making her laugh?

902
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,079
Course you can.

903
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,919
Wow! Great.

904
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,919
If she's a clinical moron.

905
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,559
Lucy, it's so amazing to see you.

906
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:50,039
What a welcome.
Nice to see you too.

907
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,119
Yeah. Good. Now, can you
still get boat party tickets?

908
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,839
I'd have thought so,
I'd just have to go and find the rep.

909
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,119
So are you coming along, then?

910
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,799
Yeah, course. It'll be amazing.

911
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:58,839
Great.

912
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,799
Cos Carli's here. In Malia.

913
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:01,999
And she's going to be
on the boat tomorrow.

914
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:04,199
If I can just get five minutes
alone with her,

915
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,039
I know we'll fix things up, it's fate.

916
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,919
So, can you go and get those tickets?

917
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:11,279
You really know how
to make a girl feel special, don't you?

918
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,079
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

919
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,439
Carli is going to love it.

920
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:15,559
Can you hurry up?

921
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:20,279
WILL: Simon's plan was coming together.

922
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,999
Meanwhile, Jane was about to experience
the full force of Jay's boyish charm.

923
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:25,519
Can you move? You're blocking the sun.

924
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:26,879
Charming!

925
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,679
What's happened to your face, Jay?

926
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:30,919
It's a food allergy.

927
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,759
I could do with one of those,
maybe an iced-bun allergy.

928
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,319
Yeah. You could.

929
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:38,399
Meanwhile, Neil had
a surprise in store for Lisa.

930
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:43,239
Forgot my trunks.

931
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:45,519
Fancy a swim?

932
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,119
Oh, leave it out, you little prick.

933
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:56,399
Right, that's it!
I'm going to fucking kill ya,

934
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:58,119
- I'm going to fucking kill ya!
- Oi!

935
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:59,639
Those are our sunbeds.
And where's our towels?

936
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,319
Oh, good.

937
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,199
Well, there weren't any towels
when we arrived

938
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:04,439
and we've been here for the last hour.

939
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,799
I didn't ask to read your fucking diary,
love. I said, "Where's our towels?"

940
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:08,559
Now, there's no need to be abusive.

941
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:10,159
If you look around,
there are signs everywhere

942
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:11,399
saying you can't reserve sunbeds.

943
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:12,879
So you moved our towels?

944
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,919
The point I'm making is,
whatever the fate of the towels,

945
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:17,319
these cannot be your beds.

946
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,119
What have you done
with my fucking towels?!

947
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:21,559
Sir, I get you nice other beds, please,
take up your stuff.

948
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:23,199
Me?! What?

949
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:24,279
Why should we move?

950
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:25,399
Because he's made a scene?

951
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,839
Because his family are too lazy
to walk 20 feet to the pool?

952
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:28,959
Seriously, mate, I am warning you.

953
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:30,479
Why have a rule
if you aren't going to enforce it?

954
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,479
The signs are redundant.

955
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:33,599
(WHIMPERING)

956
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:36,439
My towel! (CRIES)

957
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:37,839
Disabled. Course she is.

958
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:38,879
Here you go.

959
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,599
- Happy now?
- Well, obviously not.

960
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,519
(SCREECHES)

961
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,119
And that isn't helping.

962
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:46,959
You lot have got five seconds
to get off my sunbeds.

963
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:48,439
Right, come on, Will,
we'll just find somewhere else.

964
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,879
But I still don't see
why we should move.

965
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,839
Yes, his daughter
has a serious condition,

966
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:53,559
but it's not like the whole family

967
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:55,359
are therefore entitled
to pool-side seats for life.

968
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:58,719
Plus, strictly speaking,
she doesn't even need another chair.

969
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,759
Are you guests at this hotel?

970
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:06,519
Ah! No! I no swim!

971
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:09,439
Please, mister, I no swim, I beg you.

972
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:11,199
Not pool!

973
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:12,559
Argh!

974
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:13,599
All right. All right.

975
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:15,959
It's just a joke! We're... We're mates!

976
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:18,919
(GASPING AND LAUGHTER)

977
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:21,199
So little, so little!

978
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:22,319
Ah!

979
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:39,119
Great.

980
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:43,639
And with a rough grab
from a BO-ridden security guard,

981
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:46,879
Simon's perfect plan came crashing down.

982
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,799
- Thanks a lot, Jay.
- Me?! What have I done?

983
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:52,239
Oh, I don't know... Oh, yeah!

984
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:53,879
Fucked everything up for me,
like you always do.

985
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,279
I had to teach him a lesson, Si,
he was mugging me off.

986
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,079
He was nine years old and couldn't swim!

987
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:00,839
- Now my life is ruined. Thanks.
- Is this about the tickets?

988
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,919
Oh, boo-hoo-hoo!

989
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,599
So, you don't get to go
to the boat party, so what?!

990
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,399
So I don't get back together
with the woman I love!

991

Carli thinks you're a prick.

992
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:09,719
You want to watch me more closely, mate,

993
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:11,119
- you might actually learn something.
- Oh, yeah?

994
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:12,399
And what would I learn?

995
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:13,479
How to bullshit about having sex?

996
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:14,839
How to sleep in an ants' nest?

997
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:17,879
- How to be scared shitless of my dad?!
- Oh, come on, Si, calm down.

998
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,159
Maybe you'd learn not to be such
a massive tool over that miserable cunt.

999
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:21,999
Don't call Carli a cunt!

- Have you had enough yet?

00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:44,759
- I asked first!
- Ah...

1003
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,159
- Uh!
- We should do something.

1004
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:47,639
Yeah, do you want to go
and get a Subway?

1005
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:50,279
No. I meant about the fight,
we should break it up.

1006
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:51,999
Yeah.

1007
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:53,479
All right, come on, you two.

1008
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:54,799
No!

1009
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:56,279
Uh!

1010
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,879
I'm sick of his bollocks,
I'm going to fucking do him.

1011
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,119
Oh, you're hard, Si,
I didn't see you do me just now.

1012
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:02,919
- Come back here, then, you prick.
- Let's go for a walk!

1013
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:04,399
- Don't cry, Si.
- I'm not crying!

1014
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:06,519
- You're crying!
- Don't look like it, you're crying!

1015
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,719
- Come here, then.
- See you later, then, Will.

1016
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:17,959
Honestly, I'm done with that arsehole.

1017
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:19,599
I mean, why do I even
hang round with him?

1018
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:22,519
Well, yeah, obviously
we all wonder that at times.

1019
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:25,479
Look, it's been a tough couple of days,
the Carli thing is weird,

1020
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:26,679
but just cos you were
in a fight with Jay,

1021
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:27,959
- you don't have to leave.
- I'm not leaving.

1022
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:30,479
But you are aware
you're packing your suitcase.

1023
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:37,439
- I've never liked him.
- You've been mates since primary school.

1024
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:38,959
He's a little crybaby poof.

1025
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:41,439
And his hair,
everyone took the piss out of that.

1026
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:43,199
But not me, I didn't.

1027
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:44,359
Fucking wish I had now.

1028
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:46,799
- You did a bit.
- Well, no, course, a bit.

1029
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:48,479
But...not enough.

1030
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:49,839
He's a total twat!

1031
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:52,799
Oh, that's harsh, mate.
He can be a knob, but he's not a twat.

1032
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:55,279
- I'm going to sell my clothes.
- Oh, you're having a breakdown.

1033
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:57,999
She means so much to me, Will,
I don't care about anything else.

1034
00:47:58,120 --> 00:47:59,039
If I can get enough money together,

1035
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:00,519
I can buy a ticket
for the boat party off someone,

1036
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:03,559
somehow, whatever it costs.
Money is all I need.

1037
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,239
I agree with you on money,
but who's going to buy your clothes?

1038
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:06,999
No of fence, but you dress appallingly.

1039
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:08,879
Are you going to help
or just constantly undermine me?

1040
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,119
- Bit of both, I'd imagine.
- Fine.

1041
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:13,639
Do you think Alison likes me?

1042
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:16,119
13 years he's been dragging me down.

1043
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:17,599
Well...fuck him.

1044
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:18,879
- What's that?
- Boat party tickets,

1045
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:19,999
I bought four the other night

1046
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:22,239
before I passed out.
Cost a fortune.

1047
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:23,719
I thought I'd surprise him.

1048
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:25,159
Well, here's his fucking surprise.

1049
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:27,039
- Oh, no, Jay, don't.
- No, fuck him!

1050
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:29,439
And fuck that dick Will too.

- Get better at swimming!

trying to sell shit no-one wanted.

I don't think they're really friends.

who's had his apartment broken into.

1072
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,719
I reckon he'll be interested,
I'll call him.

1073
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:21,399
That'd be amazing, thanks so much.

1074
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:23,719
No problem, mate.

- See?
- All right, mate?

- Really?
- Yeah, yeah, that's the deal.

to take his clothes off.

1156
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:50,079
- Can you lend us 50 quid?
- Um, no.

1157
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:51,879
Simple and clear. 30?

1158
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,839
- No, we're going.
- Are we? Where?

1159
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:55,199
Terrible bar I know.
See you later, Richard.

1160
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:57,159
10? 10?

1161
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:59,999
10? 10? 5?!

1162
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:10,399
Here, look, it's that James bloke
Carli's sucking off.

1163
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:11,439
Oh, yeah.

1164
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:13,519
See, now that looks like a proper laugh.

1165
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:17,359
Neil, I think it's time the Pussay Patrol
recruited some new members.

1166
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:21,039
You all right, mate?

1167
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:23,959
Do I know you?

1168
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:25,479
Yeah, we're mates of Carli's.

1169
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:26,559
Ah, yeah.

1170
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:27,679
Carli Cling-on.

1171
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:28,959
Nice girl, bit keen.

1172
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:30,199
Yeah.

1173
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:31,239
Our mate's in love with her,

1174
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:32,559
- the fucking dick.
- Oh, is he?

1175
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:35,199
Well, tell him he can have a sniff
on these if he's lucky.

1176
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:37,719
Yeah, well, no, he's not really a mate.

1177
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:39,879
We ditched him, yeah, he's too tragic.

1178
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,759
It's a wicked place, this. Nice vibe.

1179
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:48,319
What, you think a bloke
sucking his own cock is wicked?

1180
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:49,359
Are you bent?

1181
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:50,719
(LAUGHTER)

1182
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:52,319
No, course not.

1183
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:53,799
We're the Pussay Patrol.

1184
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:54,839
Pussay Patrol?!

1185
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:57,719
More like the Bumming Brigade.

1186
00:54:57,840 --> 00:55:00,559
The only pussy you'll get will be a cat.

1187
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:03,839
Oi!

1188
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:06,799
I said, the only pussy
they'll get will be a cat.

1189
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:10,239
You know, like one of them stray cats
you get round here.

1190
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:13,279
- Oh, good one!
- Fuck you, you lanky prick.

1191
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:14,959
You two are fucking me off.
Get out of my face.

1192
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:17,679
Oh, no, come on, we're having a laugh,
we're all right here.

1193
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:20,279
You're not fucking all right anywhere,
you scrawny little cunt.

1194
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,879
Now fuck off before I put
a glass in your throat.

1195
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:32,799
You all right, Jay?

1196
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:34,599
Yeah. (SNIFFS)

1197
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:35,639
Are you crying?

1198
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:38,359
No, it's just the smoke in here.

1199
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:39,399
There isn't any.

1200
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:41,679
Yeah, that's what I mean.

1201
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:43,359
Do you want to go somewhere
not decadent?

1202
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:13,719
So what happens now?
It's probably a bit far

1203
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:15,839
for my dad to come and pick us up.

1204
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:20,559
- Oh, great.
- WILL: Be nice,

1205
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:22,159
maybe he's come to apologise.

1206
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:34,399
All right?

1207
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:35,519
We were just leaving, actually.

1208
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:37,679
- Oh, don't cry, Simon.
- I'm not crying.

1209
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:38,719
No, Jay, it was you that was crying,

1210
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:39,959
- remember?
- Neil!

1211
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:42,159
Come on, Si, sit down,
let's all share a fishbowl.

1212
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:43,999
- We're totally out of cash.
- Yeah.

1213
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:45,559
We're not all lucky enough
to have had a relative die.

1214
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:47,359
Well, you're clearly fucked without me,

1215
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:48,879
so I was going to offer
to pay for your drinks,

1216
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,239
but if you're going
to be a baby about it,

1217
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:51,919
- then fuck it.
- Were you really?

1218
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:56,679
Well, I'm not arsed either way,
but if I have to...yes.

1219
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:58,079
Si?

1220
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:02,039
All right, thank you, Jay.

1221
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:04,919
Shake.

1222
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:13,319
Group hug?

1223
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:16,559
(NEIL GUFFAWS)

1224
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:18,879
Oh, go on, Neil,
just one more suicide shot.

1225
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,159
Fuckin' hell.

1226
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:35,999
Right. Tenner, please.

1227
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:38,679
- Sorry, mate, had my fingers crossed.
- Oh, not again!

1228
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:42,679
WILL: Oh, my God!
I never expected to see them again.

1229
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:44,759
Doesn't matter, though, does it?
Cos even if Lucy

1230
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:47,119
can get a ticket for the boat party,
I now can't afford one.

1231
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:50,039
Yes, but incredible as it may seem,
Simon, I wasn't thinking about you.

1232
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:51,119
JANE: Hi, guys.

1233
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:53,439
Taking a break from drowning children?

1234
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:54,479
We are.

1235
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:56,039
And welcome back to Malia's
least-cool bar.

1236
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:57,279
We're regulars, obviously.

1237
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:58,879
Surprised to see you here again.

1238
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,479
Well, it's the only place we've been
where the blokes weren't total animals.

1239
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:03,559
I'll take that as a compliment.
Hello, by the way.

1240
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:04,759
Hello, Spectacles.

1241
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:06,919
Still going to get shit-faced, though.
Shots only?

1242
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:09,199
- Are you man enough, Jay-bo?
- Course.

1243
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:10,519
Thought you would be.

1244
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:13,199
Obviously we now rated as
so sexually non-threatening

1245
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:14,679
that these girls were happy
to drink with us.

1246
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:17,559
But to be fair,
I'd take that every time.

1247
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:20,839
So I've been thinking, about us...

1248
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:23,079
- What, the four of you?
- No, me and you.

1249
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:24,119
Well, there is no "us",

1250
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:26,599
so that must have been a weird
thought process, but go on.

1251
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:29,319
- I'm not sure Nicos is right for you.
- Interesting.

1252
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:32,159
Why wouldn't my sexy, charming,
caring boyfriend,

1253
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:33,959
who is also a sensational lover,

1254
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:36,119
- be right for me?
- You'd say sensational, would you?

1255
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:37,959
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

1256
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:40,239
It was nice of Richard Branson
to lend you an outfit.

1257
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:41,679
It's Neil's. Is it really that bad?

1258
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:45,639
Well, at least you look fantastic.
Right, there's only one thing for it,

1259
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:46,679
we're going to say, "fuck it",

1260
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:48,999
and do shots until one of us is sick
through our nose. My money's on me.

1261
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:50,919
Four monkey brains, please.

1262
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:53,039
I like this Simon, he's fun.

1263
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:54,679
Thanks very much.

1264
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:55,919
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

1265
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:57,279
Oh, actually, can you pay?

1266
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:02,799
Right, next!

1267
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:04,279
No, no. I can't have another one.

1268
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:06,159
I'm sorry, didn't realise
you were a lightweight.

1269
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:08,599
- What?
- Lightweight. Light-weight.

1270
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:10,039
You're one to talk about lightweights.

1271
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:11,399
What do you mean?

1272
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:13,279
Oh. Cos I'm fat?

1273
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:14,879
No.

1274
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:18,319
What I...mean, Jane, is...

1275
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:19,919
I'm gonna drink you under the table.

1276
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:21,279
You're trouble, aren't you?

1277
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:25,839
You're funny.

1278
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:28,639
That is why I know you don't have
to worry about getting laid.

1279
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:30,359
Um, did I say I was worried?

1280
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:32,039
No, but it's obvious that you are,

1281
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:33,799
and you think
that somehow I'm the answer.

1282
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:35,599
Well, I am not, and you will be fine.

1283
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:38,199
I think you might be, though.

1284
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:39,599
Nonsense.

1285
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:42,479
You know, in fact, I am so confident
I will make a pact with you.

1286
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:45,199
If you still haven't had sex
by this time next year,

1287
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:46,399
I'll have sex with you.

1288
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:48,799
As long as I'm not with Nicos,
of course.

1289
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:50,079
Of course.

1290
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:51,399
Um...

1291
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:52,839
this is a joke, right?

1292
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:56,439
A handshake's good...

1293
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:58,479
is it possible to get it in writing?

1294
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:00,199
See? Funny.

1295
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:03,239
Yes, ha-ha-ha. Hmm.

1296
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:05,999
You all right, Lise? Where's Neil?

1297
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:13,599
He is literally incredible.

1298
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:17,159
Come on, Lise,
we're getting out of here.

1299
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:18,999
Let's go for a swim. Come on, you.

1300
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:21,359
You coming swimming?

1301
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:23,359
Oh. I can't cos I haven't brought
my swimming costume.

1302
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:26,079
Oh, no! I haven't brought mine either.

1303
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:27,519
Really? What are you going to do?

1304
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:30,559
Well, I'm going to go in naked. Are you?

1305
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:34,199
Oh, right. Yeah, me too.

1306
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:37,359
Totally naked.

1307
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:39,199
Are they really going skinny dipping?

1308
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:41,239
- If I know Jane, probably, yeah.
- Really?

1309
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:44,119
- Fucking hell, really?!
- Yes.

1310
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:45,879
And...

1311
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:48,079
...what about you?

1312
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:51,759
Well, I'm meeting Nicos in half an hour.

1313
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:53,199
Course.

1314
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:54,919
So I reckon I've got time
for a quick dip.

1315
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:57,319
Alison was hopelessly out of my league.

1316
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:59,239
And yet, and yet...

1317
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:00,719
No, I had no fucking chance.

1318
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:02,759
(GIGGLES)

1319
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:09,519
Come on. What are you doing?

1320
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:10,799
Get it off.

1321
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:13,159
No, yeah. Good. I will.

1322
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:14,719
Go on, then.

1323
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:16,359
All in good time.

1324
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,559
I'll look away, if you like.

1325
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:22,399
Um, yeah, that would be nice, thank you.

1326
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:27,359
OK, so, I'm looking away now.

1327
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:33,519
And so for only the second time today,

1328
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:35,759
Simon was tricked into getting naked.

1329
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:38,759
Further along the beach,
for the first time ever, Jay was close

1330
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:41,799
to seeing some naked women
not on a computer screen.

1331
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:47,919
Come on, Jay, don't be shy.

1332
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:49,799
I'll take it all off if you will.

1333
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:52,479
Um, all right, just...give me a minute.

1334
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:54,999
Are you scared that you won't be able
to control yourself?

1335
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:58,359
MAN: She's a big girl. She is a big girl.

1336
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:01,239
Can't take it any more,
just give us a snog.

1337
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:03,319
Um...all right.

1338
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:06,999
But...let's go somewhere secret.

1339
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:08,399
Secret?

1340
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:09,719
Just give us a snog here.

1341
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:11,159
Nah.

1342
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:13,839
Let's go somewhere
people can't see us.

1343
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:16,879
- OK?
- Fucking whale on the beach.

1344
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:19,799
Actually...forget it.

1345
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:22,479
I've already seen your cock,
and it wasn't pretty.

1346
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:31,999
All I'm saying is that, logically,

1347
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:33,919
we might not have to wait
a year to have sex.

1348
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:35,359
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

1349
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:39,039
I mean, once you remove Nicos from the
equation and think, as I say, logically,

1350
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:40,839
it really makes no sense
to wait that long.

1351
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:43,759
Do you find that your logic
talks a lot of girls into bed?

1352
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:45,239
Well, no.

1353
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:46,279
I was just curious to know

1354
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:50,039
whether this kind of relentless, pedantic
chat is a big hit with the other chicks.

1355
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:53,719
- Well, obviously, it isn't.
- Thought not.

1356
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:02,719
What are you waiting for?

1357
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:05,559
Um...I don't know.

1358
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,239
OK.

1359
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:42,039
(SIGHS) Take your clothes off.

1360
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:25,239
That's it till next year, I'm afraid!

1361
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:28,319
I've lost my glasses.

1362
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:30,199
I've lost my glasses!

1363
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:31,519
God, it's freezing in here.

1364
01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:33,159
Don't be such a wuss.

1365
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:34,639
Ah!

1366
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:37,119
That's right,
let's get someone's hair wet, shall we?

1367
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:39,719
It always looks wet anyway, gel-boy.

1368
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:41,599
Right, how's this for a wet look, then?

1369

01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:48,559
Oh, shit, sorry.

1372
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:06,639
Carli!

1373
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:09,479
Carli, over here!

1374
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:12,839
Carli, over here! Carls!

1375
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:14,879
Carls.

1376
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:17,919
Come on, Will, it feels amazing!

1377
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:19,559
Just getting my glasses!

1378
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:21,559
You're not wussing out on me, are you?

1379
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:23,479
Nope! As soon as I'm not blind,

1380
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:26,079
I'll be right over with you
and the other naked ladies.

1381
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:27,879
Well, hurry up or I'm getting out!

1382
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:31,519
- Jesus Christ, come on! Where are they?

- What the...fuck are you doing?
- I'm really sorry,

1385
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:36,439
I tripped. I've lost my glasses.

1386
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:38,839
You've got a big problem now, mister,
a big fucking problem.

1387
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:40,159
Oh, God. I'm so sorry,

1388
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:41,999
I didn't know
you were down there, doing that.

I'm really sorry, mate. Help me!

01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:50,759
Nicos?

1393
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:52,519
Alison?

1394
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:53,759
What are you doing?

1395
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:55,959
WOMAN: How does she know
your fucking name, Nicos?

1396
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:58,639
Donna, I just need you to be a little
bit quiet for five minutes, please...

1397
01:05:58,760 --> 01:05:59,719
Who the fuck is that?!

1398
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:02,359
Come and sit down with me,
I want to talk to you.

1399
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:04,959
We're supposed to be meeting up
in 15 minutes,

1400
01:06:05,080 --> 01:06:06,959
- you utter, utter scumbag!
- Glasses?

1401
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:08,279
- Glasses?
- It's OK, it's OK.

1402
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:09,799
Glasses? Ooh!

1403
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:11,199
There they are.

1404
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:14,679
Alison, I love you, I love you,
you are the only girl for me,

1405
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:16,439
there no other girl in my life.

1406
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:18,079
Now, where have we heard that before?

1407
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:19,679
Oh, just shut up, Will!

1408
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:21,559
Baby, you know this weirdo?

1409
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:23,679
I am not your fucking baby!

1410
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:25,959
Alison, wait!

1411
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:27,799
Simon.

1412
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:29,399
Are you swimming naked?

1413
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:30,639
Hell, yeah.

1414
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:32,639
- That's not like you.
- Well, I'm on holidays,

1415
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:34,479
so who knows, maybe it's a new me?

1416
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:35,959
Oh, right.

1417
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:37,759
I like the old you.

1418
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:39,399
Hmm.

1419
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:41,759
OK, well, I'm off to bed.

1420
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:42,799
Can I come?

1421
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:44,239
To bed?

1422
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:47,039
- No, sure. I'm all wet anyway, so...
- Look,

1423
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:50,319
I'm knackered, I've had a shitty night,
I just want to be alone.

1424
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:53,559
But I'll see you at the boat party.
We can catch up properly there, OK?

1425
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:55,759
Yeah, course.

1426
01:06:55,880 --> 01:06:58,079
- See you at the boat party.
- Great.

1427
01:06:58,200 --> 01:06:59,159
See ya!

1428
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:01,719
- I miss you too.
- Sorry?

1429
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:03,079
You said it the other night?

1430
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:04,999
Oh, yeah.

1431
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:16,119
Lucy! Lucy!

1432
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:18,799
Alison, wait! I'll come with you!

1433
01:07:18,920 --> 01:07:21,239
- I want to be on my own!
- Um...

1434
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:22,519
You're not expecting me
to hit him or anything,

1435
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:24,199
- are you?
- No!

1436
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:25,279
- Good.
- I don't expect

1437
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:27,079
anything from anyone
but disappointment.

1438
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:28,679
You'll love me, then.

1439
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:32,159
And I will never have sex
with anyone again for as long as I live,

1440
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:33,359
and certainly not with you.

1441
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:34,679
So just fuck off!

1442
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:36,519
All of you, just fuck off!

1443
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:38,439
Does this affect our deal?

1444
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:40,119
Fuck your deal!

1445
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:45,399
- Ahhhh!
- (MUTTERS IN GREEK)

1446
01:07:47,240 --> 01:07:48,239
Lucy.

1447
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:50,199
Oh! Are you getting out?

1448
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:53,399
- Yes.
- That was Carli, did you see her?

1449
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:55,719
Yeah.

1450
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:57,039
It was dark, but I saw her.

1451
01:07:57,160 --> 01:07:58,359
Isn't she beautiful?

1452
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:00,399
Yes, she's very beautiful.

1453
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:03,279
I'm going now.

1454
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:05,039
Oh. OK!

1455
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:33,519
- All right?
- I've been better.

1456
01:08:33,640 --> 01:08:35,839
- What are you doing?
- I'm thinking.

1457
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:37,359
About how shit the holiday is?

1458
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:40,319
Partly that. Partly I'm thinking
about putting stones in my pockets

1459
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:41,559
and chucking myself in the pool.

1460
01:08:41,680 --> 01:08:44,039
Oh, I wouldn't swim in that, it's rank.

1461
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:45,079
Right.

1462
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:46,439
Also, if you put stones in your pockets,

1463
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:49,119
you'll sink, so...better to not
have the stones, really.

1464
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:50,959
I'll bear that in mind, Neil.

1465
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:56,959
I stopped believing in God when
I realised it was just "dog" backwards.

1466
01:08:57,080 --> 01:08:58,439
What?

1467
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:02,199
Well, when you think about it -
G-O-D, D-O-G.

1468
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:04,399
It's like an anagram,
but a backwards one, innit?

1469
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:05,679
Right.

1470
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:08,319
And then, after that,
I just stopped worrying about stuff.

1471
01:09:08,440 --> 01:09:11,479
You only get one go round, I reckon.
When you're dead, you're dead.

1472
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:13,959
So you can spend your time thinking
about how things haven't gone perfect

1473
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:16,799
or you can just get on with it,
have a laugh and that.

1474
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:18,479
That's what I do, I'm pretty happy.

1475
01:09:20,360 --> 01:09:21,439
You are, aren't you?

1476
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:22,639
Yeah!

1477
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:25,239
Thanks, Neil. Thanks for that.

1478
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:28,439
Just remember, it's D-O-G backwards.

1479
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:29,839
No, not that.

1480
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:31,999
No of fence, but that's moronic.
No, thanks for coming to cheer me up.

1481
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:33,399
I didn't come to cheer you up,

1482
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:35,319
I come to say I did a shit
in the children's toilet

1483
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:36,599
and I can't get rid of it.

1484
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:38,039
Oh, God!

1485
01:09:39,280 --> 01:09:41,639
Cos I thought I'd try something
different, you know? As a treat.

1486
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:43,839
- Oh...
- Oh!

1487
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:46,199
Oh!

1488
01:09:46,320 --> 01:09:47,839
Neil, what the fuck has gone into that?

1489
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:49,679
Have you been eating tear gas?

1490
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:51,199
No, it's just a bit beery.

1491
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:53,119
And that meatiness
is probably the kebabs.

1492
01:09:54,240 --> 01:09:56,199
OK, that's it. Neil, you were right.

1493
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:57,279
It may not be paradise,

1494
01:09:57,400 --> 01:09:59,159
but we can at least try and enjoy
this place for exactly what it is.

1495
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:00,399
A shithole?

1496
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:02,199
Yes, but it's our shithole,
so let's get out there

1497
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:04,879
and get royally fucked up
on Jay's dead grandad's money.

1498
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,479
It's what he would have wanted.

1499
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:09,239
If we get fined 50 euros, Neil,
you're paying it.

1500
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:11,439
- But it's not on the floor.
- Some of it is on the floor.

1501
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:13,079
Well, yeah, some of it.

Is this normal enough for you?

01:11:58,040 --> 01:12:00,159
- Probably a bit too normal.

when I'm at uni.

1512
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:09,359
When he's at uni, you mean.

1513
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:12,919
- Yeah, but I'll be at uni too.
- Will ya?

1514
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:14,799
- What, this year?
- In a few weeks.

1515
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:17,879
Oh, what? Just cos Will's going?

1516
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,839
- No. Cos I want to.
- Well...what about me?

1517
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:22,159
What?

1518
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:24,879
Well, what am I going to do?

1519
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:29,199
Um...I don't know.

1520
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:32,319
Look, I thought you knew
I was going to uni.

1521
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:35,239
Yeah, course. No, but...

1522
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:37,279
it's just that I was going to use
my grandad's money

1523
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:40,239
to set us up in business,
selling car stereos

1524
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:41,759
to Premiership footballers.

1525
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:43,679
Neil was going
to work in the depot, but...

1526
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:46,879
me, you and Rio Ferdinand are on sales,
like, having a laugh and that.

1527
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:49,119
Oh, right.

1528
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:51,279
Yeah, I'm going to do sociology.

1529
01:12:53,080 --> 01:12:54,279
Fuck.

1530
01:12:55,560 --> 01:12:58,959
I'm sorry I ripped your tickets up now.
Could have had a bit of a send-off.

1531
01:13:00,240 --> 01:13:02,239
- What tickets?
- Boat party ones.

1532
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:05,599
I bought them when I was pissed the
other night. I thought I'd surprise you.

1533
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:09,599
- Oh, well.
- You what... You tore them up?!

1534
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:14,279
- Yeah.
- What, after we had the fight?

1535
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:17,639
Yeah, I...I was angry
cos you had a go, and that.

1536
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:19,759
Yeah, sure.

1537
01:13:21,720 --> 01:13:22,839
Makes sense.

1538
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:27,639
You fucking arsehole!

1539
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:29,919
Yeah? You want me
to fucking mash you up again,

1540
01:13:30,040 --> 01:13:30,959
- do ya?
- Yeah!

1541
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:33,239
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

1542
01:13:34,280 --> 01:13:37,959
Oh, you two...can't I even have a piss
out of the end of my cock in peace?

1543
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:42,079
You two go on,

1544
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:46,479
I'm just going to have
a little recovery snooze.

1545
01:13:57,200 --> 01:14:00,319
Come on, mate,
you can have my bed tonight,

1546
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:01,919
this one's a bit bitey.

1547
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:08,679
Did I tell you I touched a boob tonight?

1548
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:10,879
Like... Like a real boob.

1549
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:14,319
A girl's one.
I didn't get to lick it, though.

1550
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:16,959
This has been the best night of my life.

1551
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:30,039
It was the day of the boat party,

1552
01:14:30,160 --> 01:14:33,159
and it looked like literally
everyone in Malia had a ticket.

1553
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:34,759
Well, everyone except me and Simon,

1554
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:37,359
whose mood was now bluer than his balls.

1555
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:40,399
If I could, I'd give you my ticket, Si.

1556
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:42,359
You can, just give me your ticket.

1557
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:45,599
Yeah, but I really want to go,
so you see, actually, I can't.

1558
01:14:45,720 --> 01:14:47,719
- Take Jay's ticket.
- No, I think he needs it.

1559
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:48,959
What, cos of Jane?

1560
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:52,959
No, in case the captain dies
and they need me to drive the boat.

1561
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:55,679
(GROANING)

1562
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:59,079
Eased up on the vomiting,
mainly retching now.

1563
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:00,959
For the record, they don't clean
that toilet floor very often,

1564
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:02,999
lots of pubes on hands, knees...
and my face

1565
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:06,239
when I had a little lie-down.
I cannot believe we've been eating here.

1566
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:07,279
Wow, they look hot!

1567
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:09,839
- Bit young for you, ain't they, Neil?
- Behave.

1568
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:12,239
Lucy. Lucy!

1569
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:15,759
Alison! Aliso...
Oh. I give up.

1570
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:18,519
All right, boys? Who killed Will?

1571
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:19,719
(GROANS)

1572
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:21,839
- What's up with Lucy?
- I don't know.

1573
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:24,879
If you ask her rather than
talking about your ex the whole time,

1574
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,839
- you might find out.
- Oh, God, really?

1575
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:29,839
Fine.

1576
01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:32,519
- You coming to the boat party, then?
- You try and stop me.

1577
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:35,159
We just saw two hot fellas
dressed as firemen getting on board.

1578
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:37,319
Might need a hand with their hoses.

1579
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:39,919
Might have to set fire to my knickers.

1580
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:42,119
- I'll come with you, if you like.
- No, thank you.

1581
01:15:42,240 --> 01:15:43,439
Come on, Lisa.

1582
01:15:45,320 --> 01:15:47,319
You look as bad on the outside
as I feel on the inside.

1583
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:50,799
Oh, don't worry,
I feel like shit on the inside too.

1584
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:52,279
Although...

1585
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:54,119
I don't have a pube on my cheek.

1586
01:15:54,240 --> 01:15:55,599
Oh, God.

1587
01:15:55,720 --> 01:15:59,639
Anyway, seeing you in such a mess
has at least cheered me up a bit.

1588
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:00,679
Glad to be of service.

1589
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:03,639
You know I have a penis
sunburnt on my back too.

1590
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:06,119
Must be reassuring to know
that however bad life gets,

1591
01:16:06,240 --> 01:16:07,159
you're not me.

1592
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:08,199
It is.

1593
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:11,359
Good. That means every time you're down,
you have to come and hang out with me.

1594
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:12,519
Yeah, I think I might.

1595
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:13,919
Starting with today.

1596
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:16,119
I've got Nicos's ticket
for the boat party.

1597
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:17,159
Do you fancy joining me?

1598
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:18,639
Um, yes.

1599
01:16:18,760 --> 01:16:19,879
More than anything.

1600
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,079
Great. On one condition, though.

1601
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:23,439
Anything.

1602
01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:26,079
At no point are you allowed
to say, "I told you so."

1603
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:28,679
Ooh, not sure I can guarantee that.

1604
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:31,359
So it's not that I'd rather go
to a party that infinitely heightens

1605
01:16:31,480 --> 01:16:33,559
my sense of being out of kilter
with the rest of the world,

1606
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:36,399
it's just that Alison is sort of
the fittest girl I've ever met

1607
01:16:36,520 --> 01:16:38,319
- and maybe...
- It's fine, Will, honestly.

1608
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:41,159
Go for it, I'll just find a quiet spot
and hang myself.

1609
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:43,359
Great. Lucy, make sure
he doesn't hang himself.

1610
01:16:43,480 --> 01:16:46,119
I'm off. Look at me,
following my cock like a normal person.

1611
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:50,879
Sorry for saying cock.

1612
01:16:57,240 --> 01:16:59,359
I didn't realise
I was being such a dick.

1613
01:17:01,080 --> 01:17:02,119
You were.

1614
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:06,999
- I'm trying to say sorry.
- Well, say it, then.

1615
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:08,519
Sorry.

1616
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:10,199
For being a dick.

1617
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:11,919
Sorry for being a dick.

1618
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:14,959
And for having too much gel
in your hair.

1619
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:16,679
I don't think I've got that much...

1620
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:19,519
OK, I'm sorry for having
too much gel in my hair.

1621
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:25,479
You should probably get going.

1622
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:26,999
I'm not that bothered.

1623
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:28,039
Really?

1624
01:17:28,160 --> 01:17:29,279
Yeah.

1625
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:32,159
If you like, maybe we could hang out,
the two of us.

1626
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:34,119
I quite fancy just staying by the pool.

1627
01:17:34,240 --> 01:17:37,839
Yeah, I mean, why spend the day
having unbelievable fun on the party boat

1628
01:17:37,960 --> 01:17:41,359
when you could be taking a depressed man
swimming at a family hotel?

1629
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:42,439
I'm serious.

1630
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:43,999
I don't mind.

1631
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:46,919
I might even cheer you up...

1632
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:48,799
if they let you back in.

1633
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:51,479
I honestly don't think
I'll be very good company,

1634
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:53,119
but thanks for the offer.

1635
01:17:53,240 --> 01:17:55,359
You go, I'll be all right.

1636
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:03,759
Look...

1637
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:06,319
it's obvious how much
Carli means to you.

1638
01:18:06,440 --> 01:18:08,159
She's lucky...

1639
01:18:08,280 --> 01:18:09,319
I think.

1640
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:11,919
I'm sure you'll sort it out.

1641
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:15,039
She goes back tomorrow.
I can feel her slipping away.

1642
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:20,239
Simon...

1643
01:18:20,360 --> 01:18:22,959
if she really means that much to you,

1644
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:24,719
I want you to take my ticket.

1645
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:27,279
Lucy...

1646
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:30,519
If you really want to go, take it.

1647
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:34,599
If you really want to go.

1648
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:37,279
God, you'd do that for me?

1649
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:39,159
Yeah.

1650
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:42,119
Thanks!

1651
01:18:42,240 --> 01:18:44,479
I'll see you later,
enjoy the pool! Will!

1652
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:46,079
Will! I got a ticket, I got a ticket!

1653
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:47,679
Will!

1654
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:49,359
I got a ticket, I got a ticket!

1655
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:57,119
# We are go!

1656
01:18:57,240 --> 01:19:00,679
# The time has come to leave this place

1657
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:04,559
# Leave it all behind

1658
01:19:04,680 --> 01:19:08,199
# There's so much more here to envision

1659
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:10,879
# Out of your mind... #

1660
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,359
WILL: The boat party
was Jay's promised land...

1661
01:19:13,480 --> 01:19:16,039
sun, sea, booze, and who knows,

1662
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:20,079
maybe even some sex, minge,
fanny and tits...and booze...and sex.

1663
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:21,159
Mental!

1664
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:23,639
- Cheeky shot to get us started?
- You are kidding.

1665
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:24,719
Oh, come on, it's the best cure.

1666
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:26,119
Fair enough, what are we toasting?

1667
01:19:26,240 --> 01:19:28,399
To the Pussay!

1668
01:19:28,520 --> 01:19:30,199
ALL: The Pussay!

1669
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:34,079
Neil?

1670
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:35,479
To being playas!

1671
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:37,239
ALL: Playas!

1672
01:19:39,880 --> 01:19:40,839
Si?

1673
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:41,919
To me and Carli!

1674
01:19:42,040 --> 01:19:43,879
- No, you're all right, mate.
- Fuck off.

1675
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:49,159
Fine. Well, I'm going off
to find her, anyway.

1676
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:51,679
- Oh, Si, I forgot something.
- What?

1677
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:53,679
Ah! For fuck's sake.

1678
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:55,639
You know I should probably find Jane,
I promised her a dance.

1679
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:58,759
- What?
- Well, no, just a dance.

1680
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:00,719
And then we can get
some proper fit gash.

1681
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:01,799
But Jane's all right, you know.

1682
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:02,919
She's a laugh.

1683
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:04,159
The fat ones are always jolly.

1684
01:20:04,280 --> 01:20:07,159
Neil, what a horrible thing to say.

1685
01:20:08,240 --> 01:20:10,599
- Just you and me, then, Will.
- Oh, no.

1686
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:13,199
Oh, God.
What was I thinking, tequila?!

1687
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:17,479
Shit, sorry!

1688
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:21,799
Sorry!

1689
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:26,079
Make your bloody mind up, you wally!

1690
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:30,399
(SIGHS)

1691
01:20:53,080 --> 01:20:54,719
Richard! All right, mate?

1692
01:20:54,840 --> 01:20:55,919
- All right!
- How's it going?

1693
01:20:56,040 --> 01:20:56,999
Yeah, not too bad.

1694
01:20:57,120 --> 01:20:59,399
I was DJing at this techno club, right?

1695
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:01,439
And this mental emo bird
comes over to me and says,

1696
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:03,239
"I want you to piss on me
and then fuck me."

1697
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:04,359
So I pissed all over her.

1698
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:05,399
And then fucked her?

1699
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:06,559
No, she was covered in piss!

1700
01:21:06,680 --> 01:21:07,599
Oh, course.

1701
01:21:07,720 --> 01:21:09,639
Anyway, the other day, right?

1702
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:11,519
I started crying and couldn't stop,

1703
01:21:11,640 --> 01:21:15,239
so yeah, my mum and dad have flown over
to take me home. Pretty cool.

1704
01:21:21,080 --> 01:21:22,759
Yeah...

1705
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:23,999
Come and say hello?

1706
01:21:24,120 --> 01:21:25,719
All right.

1707
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:29,319
Dad, Mum.

1708
01:21:30,440 --> 01:21:31,479
All right...

1709
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:34,039
Back off, bitch!

1710
01:21:34,160 --> 01:21:35,959
Not this time.

1711
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:41,879
Jane?

1712
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,879
- Jane!
- Oh, hello.

1713
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,879
Sure you want to be seen with me?

1714
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:48,679
Yeah, I do. I really do.

1715
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:50,919
Can we have that snog now?

1716
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:53,439
What? Now? Here?
Right in front of everyone?

1717
01:21:53,560 --> 01:21:56,639
Um...yeah. Yeah.

1718
01:21:56,760 --> 01:21:58,279
Yeah? Well, I'm not that kind of girl.

1719
01:21:58,400 --> 01:21:59,719
Oh.

1720
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:02,839
(POSH VOICE) So, I suggest
we find somewhere a little more private.

1721
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:05,119
- I don't mind.
- I told you,

1722
01:22:05,240 --> 01:22:09,159
I do. And, to be fair, in private
you might get a blow job out of it.

1723
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:21,519
- Simey!
- Oh, hi!

1724
01:22:21,640 --> 01:22:22,719
Carli!

1725
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:26,759
Where have you been?

1726
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:29,319
- I've been looking all over for you.
- I need to tell you something.

1727
01:22:29,440 --> 01:22:31,239
Ssh! I know.

1728
01:22:51,080 --> 01:22:51,999
Get it all up.

1729
01:22:52,120 --> 01:22:54,319
Little easier
on the sunburnt cock, please.

1730
01:22:54,440 --> 01:22:55,479
Sorry.

1731
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:56,639
It's fine.

1732
01:22:58,120 --> 01:23:00,359
I mean, what a total twat!

1733
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:01,399
Me?!

1734
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:04,599
No, Nicos, the total
and utter Greek twat.

1735
01:23:04,720 --> 01:23:05,679
Did you see her?

1736
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:07,919
She was hideous,
she must have been at least 30.

1737
01:23:08,040 --> 01:23:10,679
I told you so.

1738
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:12,559
You arsehole, you had to say it,
didn't you?

1739
01:23:12,680 --> 01:23:14,239
Even in the fucking state you're in,

1740
01:23:14,360 --> 01:23:17,799
- you couldn't resist.
- Sorry. But at least I'm consistent.

1741
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:20,199
Yes, you are, aren't you?

1742
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:26,559
OK, so I think I'd like
to revise my offer.

1743
01:23:26,680 --> 01:23:29,439
How about instead of having sex
with you in a year,

1744
01:23:29,560 --> 01:23:31,799
I have sex with you all year?

1745
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:34,719
What?

1746
01:23:34,840 --> 01:23:37,679
- It's a one-time offer.
- To confirm,

1747
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:39,919
do you mean like a girlfriend
or like a prostitute?

1748
01:23:40,040 --> 01:23:42,519
I was thinking more like a girlfriend.

1749
01:23:43,880 --> 01:23:47,439
- Could you write it...
- No! I am not going to write it down.

1750
01:23:48,760 --> 01:23:50,599
Look, what I'm trying to say is,
I like you.

1751
01:23:50,720 --> 01:23:53,759
Despite myself, I really do like you.

1752
01:23:55,080 --> 01:23:56,799
If you like me too, then we're on.

1753
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,119
Um...but not till you've
brushed your teeth.

1754
01:24:03,160 --> 01:24:04,079
Oh!

1755
01:24:09,320 --> 01:24:12,399
- That should do it.
- You know we could do this for ever.

1756
01:24:12,520 --> 01:24:14,439
Yeah, I know, yeah.

1757
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:16,239
Oh, God, Carls, I thought I'd lost you.

1758
01:24:16,360 --> 01:24:17,599
I thought I'd lost you!

1759
01:24:17,720 --> 01:24:19,959
And no matter how many times they hit me
in the balls, I knew I was right.

1760
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:22,199
And I've worked it all out,
it was so simple.

1761
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:23,719
I'll just get a job near your uni
for three years,

1762
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:26,999
four if you do an MA,
and then we can be together for ever.

1763
01:24:27,120 --> 01:24:28,479
For ever.

1764
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:29,679
Just like we should be.

1765
01:24:31,960 --> 01:24:33,559
Carli...

1766
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:36,079
...what's wrong?

1767
01:24:36,200 --> 01:24:37,839
Did you hear what I said?

1768
01:24:37,960 --> 01:24:39,359
Something about being hit in the balls?

1769
01:24:39,480 --> 01:24:41,039
Well, yeah, but...

1770
01:24:41,160 --> 01:24:43,159
mainly about being together for ever.

1771
01:24:43,280 --> 01:24:45,639
Sorry, Simon,
could you just kiss me again?

1772
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:56,759
Sorry, Carls, this is wrong.

1773
01:24:56,880 --> 01:24:58,039
What?

1774
01:24:58,160 --> 01:24:59,959
I've made a bad choice today.

1775
01:25:02,680 --> 01:25:05,039
I honestly wish you
all the best with your life,

1776
01:25:05,160 --> 01:25:07,199
but right now, I have to leave.

1777
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:09,839
I don't think you'll ever see me again.

1778
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:14,679
But I'll see you at your mum's birthday
in two weeks' time.

1779
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:16,639
Well, yeah, but then after that.

1780
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:19,079
And then your brother's 16th
the following week.

1781
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:21,399
Yeah, it was more
of a metaphorical thing.

1782
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:23,919
- Anyway, I'll see you around, Carls.
- Yes,

1783
01:25:24,040 --> 01:25:26,839
- at your mum's.
- Please, can I just...

1784
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:28,039
Thank you.

1785
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:33,359
Below deck, Neil was being as faithful
as ever to his girlfriend,

1786
01:25:33,480 --> 01:25:36,359
by aggressively dry-humping Lisa
to within an inch of her life.

1787
01:25:39,920 --> 01:25:40,839
Neil...

1788
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:43,679
Neil, stop.

1789
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:45,399
What's up? Is it my zip?
I can undo it, if you want.

1790
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:47,959
No, it's not that.

1791
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:49,559
I just think this is wrong.

1792
01:25:49,680 --> 01:25:51,639
I feel bad for your girlfriend.

1793
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:54,679
- No, it's fine, we aren't kissing.
- Yeah, but...

1794
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:56,599
look at what we are doing.

1795
01:25:56,720 --> 01:26:01,679
I mean, how do you think you'd feel
if you saw her doing this with a guy?

1796
01:26:01,800 --> 01:26:03,999
I wouldn't want to be treated like this.

1797
01:26:04,120 --> 01:26:06,479
- I've got ethics.
- Yeah.

1798
01:26:06,600 --> 01:26:09,319
Yeah, you're right,
it's just that, um...

1799
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,159
...Nicole dumped me
before we got out here

1800
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:16,039
and I didn't want to say anything
to the others cos I was embarrassed.

1801
01:26:16,160 --> 01:26:18,119
- Oh, Neil...
- Yeah.

1802
01:26:18,240 --> 01:26:22,199
She sent me this text, saying like,
"You dance like a twat, you are dumped."

1803
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:24,399
It broke me up.

1804
01:26:24,520 --> 01:26:28,119
So...this is fine and, if you want,
we can even kiss.

1805
01:26:28,240 --> 01:26:29,959
Oh, Neil!

1806
01:26:30,080 --> 01:26:31,559
Is that true? Really?

1807
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:33,359
Yeah, course.

1808
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:34,479
If you like.

1809
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,319
That was just... I mean...

1810
01:26:44,440 --> 01:26:47,199
Did it not taste funny?
Cos it looks funny.

1811
01:26:47,320 --> 01:26:48,479
All right, mate, who's this, then?

1812
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:49,799
Hi, I'm Jane.

1813
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:51,879
- She's my girlfriend.
- Oh, is she?

1814
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,559
Fuckin' hell, you want to be careful
she doesn't fall overboard

1815
01:26:54,680 --> 01:26:55,799
- cos...
- Cos I'll get harpooned?

1816
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:58,079
Cos they might think I'm a new island?

1817
01:26:58,200 --> 01:27:00,079
Cos all the water will splash out
onto the land?

1818
01:27:00,200 --> 01:27:01,999
I've heard them all, take your pick.

1819
01:27:02,120 --> 01:27:04,559
Fuckin' 'ell, tubs, all right,
it was only a joke.

1820
01:27:04,680 --> 01:27:07,639
Anyway, seeing as you're coming
out there like a naughty boy,

1821
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:10,759
how about you do me a favour?
I need a note for the old toot.

1822
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:13,599
We weren't doing drugs, actually.

1823
01:27:13,720 --> 01:27:15,199
Christ, for his sake, I hope you were.

1824
01:27:15,320 --> 01:27:18,119
There are laws against fucking cow,
mate, even in Greece.

1825
01:27:19,800 --> 01:27:22,679
Now, I'm going to need to take that note
off you. You're a mate.

1826
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:24,679
You don't mind, do you?

1827
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:26,199
Give.

1828
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:30,079
No, no, not at all.

1829
01:27:34,840 --> 01:27:36,599
There you are, mate, already rolled.

1830
01:27:36,720 --> 01:27:38,439
Cheers. I'll keep this, yeah?

1831
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:39,759
No problemo.

1832
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:43,799
WILL: I think the Government's
anti-drugs campaign

1833
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:45,639
would be more successful
if they pointed out

1834
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:46,759
that every now and again,

1835
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:49,599
there's a small chance you might
accidentally snort some poo.

1836
01:27:49,720 --> 01:27:51,999
(RETCHES)

1837
01:27:58,560 --> 01:27:59,719
Simon?

1838
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:01,239
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

1839
01:28:01,360 --> 01:28:04,759
Yeah, for the first time in my life,
I think I actually am.

1840
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:05,919
I'm clear, anyway.

1841
01:28:06,040 --> 01:28:06,999
How'd it go with Carli?

1842
01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:08,879
Long term - good. Short term - horrific.

1843
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:10,959
Have you murdered her?

1844
01:28:11,080 --> 01:28:12,959
No, but I am starting to think
that maybe Carli's not all that.

1845
01:28:13,080 --> 01:28:14,199
Well, it's taken a while.

1846
01:28:14,320 --> 01:28:16,439
- Better late than never.
- I think Lucy might be the one.

1847
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:18,519
Yes, obviously.

1848
01:28:18,640 --> 01:28:20,559
Lucy's much nicer
and actually likes you.

1849
01:28:20,680 --> 01:28:22,559
But I'm worried I might have been
a bit of a dick to her.

1850
01:28:22,680 --> 01:28:26,279
You've been more than a bit of a dick
to her. You've been a massive dick to her.

1851
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:27,999
She still likes you, anyway.

1852
01:28:28,120 --> 01:28:29,399
Good, that's really good.

1853
01:28:36,520 --> 01:28:38,719
Does he always strip when he's happy?

1854
01:28:38,840 --> 01:28:39,839
Yeah, normally.

1855
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:42,959
Simon!
You can't go up there, there's a sign.

1856
01:28:43,080 --> 01:28:44,239
Oh, sign(!)

1857
01:28:44,360 --> 01:28:46,239
Alison, will you text Lucy
and tell her I'm coming to get her?

1858
01:28:46,360 --> 01:28:47,399
Course I will.

1859
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:48,679
Brilliant!

1860
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:49,799
All right?

1861
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:50,919
Yeah.

1862
01:28:51,040 --> 01:28:52,079
What are you doing up there, then?

1863
01:28:52,200 --> 01:28:54,439
I'm going to swim back to shore
and tell Lucy how I feel.

1864
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:55,799
How romantic.

1865
01:28:55,920 --> 01:28:57,359
It is, isn't it?

1866
01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:02,439
Is it a bit far?

1867
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:05,079
No, bollocks. You can see the shore.

1868
01:29:05,200 --> 01:29:06,759
I've swum further than that underwater.

1869
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:08,559
Do it! Just swim there

1870
01:29:08,680 --> 01:29:10,559
and show her what she means to you
and then kiss her.

1871
01:29:10,680 --> 01:29:11,599
On the fanny!

1872
01:29:11,720 --> 01:29:12,919
- Jay!
- Sorry, darling.

1873
01:29:21,880 --> 01:29:23,999
Right, fuck it, you only live once.

1874
01:29:24,120 --> 01:29:26,359
(CHEERING)

1875
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:33,959
ALL: Jump, jump, jump, jump,
jump, jump, jump, jump!

1876
01:29:36,600 --> 01:29:38,599
Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump!

1877
01:29:38,720 --> 01:29:41,719
Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump,
jump, jump!

1878
01:29:45,440 --> 01:30:12,279
(CHEERING)

1879
01:30:40,120 --> 01:30:43,399
I think he might be drowning.

1880
01:31:18,640 --> 01:31:20,239
Simon!

1881
01:31:23,960 --> 01:31:26,039
Oh, I think I've shit myself.

1882
01:31:31,360 --> 01:31:33,439
Lucy, it's normally bigger, it was cold.

1883
01:31:35,320 --> 01:31:37,359
WILL: One of us should probably have
gone to hospital with Simon.

1884
01:31:37,480 --> 01:31:40,239
But, to be perfectly honest,
we had more important things to do.

1885
01:31:40,640 --> 01:31:42,039
