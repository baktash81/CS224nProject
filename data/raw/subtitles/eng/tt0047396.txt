- She expects me to marry her.
- That's normal.

- I don't want to.
- That's abnormal.

Every man's ready for marriage

- No.

- What?

141
00:11:07,847 --> 00:11:10,077

00:11:15,087 --> 00:11:17,806
- No, she's just not the girl for me.
- Yeah, she's only perfect.

145
00:11:17,967 --> 00:11:19,958
She's too perfect. She's too talented.

146
00:11:20,127 --> 00:11:22,516
She's too beautiful.
She's too sophisticated.

147
00:11:22,687 --> 00:11:24,917
She's too everything, but what I want.

148
00:11:25,087 --> 00:11:28,204
Is what you want
something you can discuss?

149
00:11:28,367 --> 00:11:30,437
What? It's very simple, Stella.

150
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:34,043
She belongs to that rarefied
atmosphere of Park Avenue:

151
00:11:34,207 --> 00:11:37,563
expensive restaurants
and literary cocktail parties.

152
00:11:37,727 --> 00:11:39,558
People with sense
belong wherever they're put.

153
00:11:39,727 --> 00:11:42,446
Can you imagine her tramping around
the world with a camera bum

154
00:11:42,607 --> 00:11:44,837
who never has more than
a week's salary in the bank?

155
00:11:45,007 --> 00:11:47,362
If she was only ordinary.

156
00:11:48,167 --> 00:11:49,839
You never gonna get married?

157
00:11:50,007 --> 00:11:51,725
I'll probably get married
one of these days,

158
00:11:51,887 --> 00:11:54,276
but when I do, it's gonna be
to someone who thinks of life

159
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:58,599
not just as a new dress
and a lobster dinner

160
00:11:58,767 --> 00:12:00,837
and the latest scandal.

161
00:12:01,007 --> 00:12:04,044
I need a woman who's willing to...
Hold it.

162
00:12:04,207 --> 00:12:07,882
Who's willing to go anywhere
and do anything and love it.

163
00:12:08,047 --> 00:12:11,244
So the honest thing for me to do
is just call the whole thing off.

164
00:12:11,407 --> 00:12:13,079
Let her find somebody else.

165
00:12:13,247 --> 00:12:15,078
Yeah, I can hear you now.

166
00:12:15,247 --> 00:12:18,956
"Get out of my life,
you perfectly wonderful woman."

167
00:12:19,127 --> 00:12:21,118
Look, Mr Jefferies,
I'm not an educated woman,

168
00:12:21,287 --> 00:12:23,164
but I can tell you one thing.

169
00:12:23,327 --> 00:12:26,444
When a man and a woman see
each other and like each other,

170
00:12:26,607 --> 00:12:28,518
they ought to come together, wham,

171
00:12:28,687 --> 00:12:30,439
like a couple of taxis on Broadway

172
00:12:30,607 --> 00:12:32,996
and not sit around analysing each other

173
00:12:33,167 --> 00:12:34,805
<i>like two specimens in a bottle,</i>

174
00:12:34,967 --> 00:12:37,845
There's an intelligent way
to approach marriage.

175
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,076
Intelligence.

176
00:12:39,247 --> 00:12:42,842
Nothing has caused the human race
so much trouble as intelligence.

177
00:12:43,007 --> 00:12:45,282
(Laughs) Modern marriage.

178
00:12:45,447 --> 00:12:49,076
- No, we've progressed emotionally.
- <i>Baloney,</i>

179
00:12:49,687 --> 00:12:53,726
Once it was see somebody,
get excited, get married.

180
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:55,206
Now, it's read a lot of books,

181
00:12:55,367 --> 00:12:58,837

183
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:03,605
between a petting party
and a civil service exam.

184
00:13:04,727 --> 00:13:07,241
People have different emotional levels -

185
00:13:07,407 --> 00:13:10,797
<i>When I married Myles, we were both</i>
<i>a couple of maladjusted misfits,</i>

186
00:13:10,967 --> 00:13:16,087
We are still maladjusted, and we
have loved every minute of it.

187
00:13:16,247 --> 00:13:17,282
Well, that's fine, Stella.

188
00:13:17,447 --> 00:13:19,244
Now, would you
fix me a sandwich, please?

189
00:13:19,407 --> 00:13:23,241
Yes, I will. And I'll spread
a little common sense on the bread.

190
00:13:23,407 --> 00:13:26,126
Lisa's loaded to her fingertips
with love for you.

191
00:13:26,287 --> 00:13:29,006
I got two words of advice
for you: Marry her.

192
00:13:29,167 --> 00:13:31,727
- She pay you much?
- Oh.

193

194
00:13:48,087 --> 00:13:49,964
There you are.

195
00:13:52,887 --> 00:13:54,206
- Here's the key.
- Thank you.

196
00:14:02,287 --> 00:14:05,484
Well, if you want anything, just ring.

197
00:14:17,567 --> 00:14:18,886
Honey.

198
00:14:19,367 --> 00:14:20,800

They ought to list that dress

225
00:16:42,287 --> 00:16:44,881
We sell a dozen a day

226

Who buys them, tax collectors?

227
00:16:46,607 --> 00:16:48,598
Even if I had to pay,
it would be worth it.

228
00:16:48,767 --> 00:16:51,839
- Just for the occasion.
- <i>Why, is something big going on?</i>

229
00:16:52,007 --> 00:16:54,441
It's going on right here. It's a big night.

It's just an old

The calendar's full of them.

232

It's opening night of the last depressing
week of L B Jefferies in a cast.

233
00:17:04,487 --> 00:17:07,957
Well, I haven't noticed
a big demand for tickets.

234
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:10,800
That's because I bought out the house.

235
00:17:10,967 --> 00:17:14,437
You know, this cigarette box
has seen better days.

236
00:17:14,607 --> 00:17:17,804
I picked that up in Shanghai,
which has also seen better days.

237
00:17:17,967 --> 00:17:20,162
It's cracked and you never use it.

238
00:17:20,327 --> 00:17:22,045
It's too ornate.

239
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:25,756
I'm sending up a plain, flat,
silver one with your initials.

240
00:17:25,927 --> 00:17:28,395
That's no way to spend
your hard-earned money.

241
00:17:28,567 --> 00:17:30,398
I wanted to.

242
00:17:30,647 --> 00:17:32,160
Ooh!

243
00:17:33,527 --> 00:17:35,995
What would you think of
starting off with dinner at '21 '?

244
00:17:36,167 --> 00:17:38,806
You have, perhaps,
an ambulance downstairs?

245
00:17:38,967 --> 00:17:41,800
No, better than that: '21 '.

246
00:17:46,687 --> 00:17:50,157
<i>Thank you for waiting, Carl,</i>
<i>The kitchen's right there on the left,</i>

247
00:17:50,327 --> 00:17:52,318
I'll take the wine.

248
00:17:54,607 --> 00:17:56,279
- Good evening, Mr Jefferies.
- <i>Carl,</i>

249
00:17:56,447 --> 00:17:59,484
Just put everything
in the oven, Carl, on low.

250
00:17:59,647 --> 00:18:02,559
- Let's open the wine now.
- <i>(Jeff) Alright,</i>

251
00:18:02,727 --> 00:18:05,480
- It's a Montrachet.
- A great big glassful.

252
00:18:05,647 --> 00:18:08,639
There's a corkscrew right over there.

253
00:18:08,807 --> 00:18:10,638
Here, I'll do it.

254
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:14,475
- Big enough?
- Yeah, they're fine.

255
00:18:14,647 --> 00:18:17,036
I can't think of anything more
boring or tiresome

256
00:18:17,207 --> 00:18:20,438
than what you've been through
and the last week must be the hardest.

257
00:18:20,607 --> 00:18:24,725
Alright. Yeah, I want to get
this thing off and get moving.

258
00:18:24,887 --> 00:18:29,039
Well, I'm going to make this
a week you'll never forget.

259
00:18:30,487 --> 00:18:32,557
Fine, thanks.

260
00:18:32,727 --> 00:18:34,479
Just a minute, Carl.

261
00:18:34,647 --> 00:18:37,286
- This will take care of the taxi.
- Thank you, Miss Fremont.

262
00:18:37,447 --> 00:18:41,963
- Have a pleasant dinner, Mr Jefferies.
- Alright, Good night.

263
00:18:42,127 --> 00:18:43,446
Good night.

264
00:18:45,367 --> 00:18:46,641
What a day I've had.

265
00:18:46,807 --> 00:18:49,116
- <i>Are you tired?</i>
- Not a bit.

266
00:18:49,287 --> 00:18:50,766
I was all morning in a meeting,

267
00:18:50,927 --> 00:18:54,283
then I had to dash to the Waldorf
for a quick drink with Madam Dufrene,

268
00:18:54,447 --> 00:18:57,757
who's just over from Paris
with some spy reports.

269
00:18:58,807 --> 00:19:02,595
<i>Then I had to go to '21' and have lunch</i>
<i>with the</i> Harper's Bazaar <i>people,</i>

270
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:04,519
That's when I ordered dinner.

271
00:19:04,687 --> 00:19:07,565
Then I had two fall showings
20 blocks apart.

272
00:19:07,727 --> 00:19:09,763
Then I had to have a cocktail
with Leland and Slim Hayward.

273
00:19:09,927 --> 00:19:11,645
We're trying to get his new show.

274
00:19:11,807 --> 00:19:13,525
Then I had to dash back and change.

275
00:19:13,687 --> 00:19:17,919
Well, now, tell me,
what was Mrs Hayward wearing?

276
00:19:18,087 --> 00:19:19,839
- She looked wonderfully cool.
- She didn't, did she?

277
00:19:20,007 --> 00:19:22,885
She had on the most divine
Italian hand-printed -

278
00:19:23,047 --> 00:19:25,038
- Oh, Italian?
- Oh, you.

279
00:19:25,207 --> 00:19:28,597
- Italian. Imagine.
- To think I planted three nice items

280
00:19:28,767 --> 00:19:30,962
- in the columns about you today.
- You did?

281
00:19:31,127 --> 00:19:34,199
- You can't buy that kind of publicity.
- I know.

282
00:19:34,367 --> 00:19:38,042
Someday you may want to
open up a studio of your own here.

283
00:19:38,207 --> 00:19:41,244
How would I run it from, say, Pakistan?

284
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:44,399
Jeff...

285
00:19:44,967 --> 00:19:48,801
Isn't it time you came home?
You could pick your assignment.

286
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:53,038
- I wish there was one I wanted.
- Make the one you want.

287
00:19:53,207 --> 00:19:54,845
- You mean leave the magazine?
- Yes.

288
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:57,965
- For what?
- For yourself and me.

289
00:19:59,247 --> 00:20:00,919
I could get you a dozen
assignments tomorrow:

290
00:20:01,087 --> 00:20:02,839
- Fashions, portraits.
- (Chuckles)

291
00:20:03,007 --> 00:20:06,397
- Now, don't laugh. I could do it.
- That's what I'm afraid of.

292
00:20:06,567 --> 00:20:09,764
Can you see me driving down
to the fashion salon in a jeep

293
00:20:09,927 --> 00:20:13,886
wearing combat boots and a three-day
beard? Wouldn't that make a hit?

294
00:20:14,007 --> 00:20:16,805
I could see you looking
very handsome and successful

295
00:20:16,967 --> 00:20:18,844
in a dark blue, flannel suit.

296
00:20:19,007 --> 00:20:22,079
Let's stop talking nonsense, shall we?

297
00:20:22,247 --> 00:20:23,680
Hm?

298
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:28,002
Guess I'd better
start setting up for dinner.

Thank you.

338
00:23:23,367 --> 00:23:26,165
Well, she picked the most
prosperous-looking one.

339
00:23:26,327 --> 00:23:29,125
She's not in love with him...
or any of them.

340
00:23:29,287 --> 00:23:32,040
Oh, how can you tell that from here?

341
00:23:32,967 --> 00:23:36,880
You said it resembled
my apartment, didn't you?

342
00:23:51,327 --> 00:23:53,761
I hope they're cooked this time.

Where's that
wonderful music coming from?

348
00:25:17,927 --> 00:25:21,158
Some songwriter over there
in the studio apartment.

349
00:25:21,327 --> 00:25:22,555
Well...

350
00:25:22,727 --> 00:25:24,445
He lives alone.

351
00:25:24,607 --> 00:25:28,077
Probably had a very unhappy marriage.

352
00:25:28,247 --> 00:25:30,363
Oh, it's enchanting.

353

Hm. No wonder he's having
so much trouble with it.

355
00:25:43,087 --> 00:25:44,839
At least you can't say
the dinner isn't right.

laugh, wear clothes.

Well, now look -

361
00:26:09,807 --> 00:26:12,116
If you're saying all this because
you don't want to tell me the truth,

362
00:26:12,287 --> 00:26:14,755
because you're hiding something from
me, then maybe I can understand.

363
00:26:14,927 --> 00:26:16,485
I'm not hiding anything. It's just that -

364
00:26:16,647 --> 00:26:17,875
It doesn't make sense.

365
00:26:18,047 --> 00:26:21,039
What's so different about it here
from there or anyplace you go

366
00:26:21,207 --> 00:26:23,516
that one person couldn't live
in both places just as easily?

367
00:26:23,687 --> 00:26:25,120
Some people can.
Now, if you'll just let me -

368
00:26:25,287 --> 00:26:28,120
What is it but travelling from
one place to another taking pictures?

369
00:26:28,287 --> 00:26:30,357
It's like being a tourist
on an endless vacation.

370
00:26:30,527 --> 00:26:32,802
OK. That's your opinion.
You're entitled to it.

371
00:26:32,967 --> 00:26:34,764
- Now, let me give you my side.
- It's ridiculous to say

372
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:38,636
that it can only be done by a special,
private little group of anointed people.

373
00:26:38,807 --> 00:26:41,765
I made a simple statement,
a true statement,

374
00:26:41,927 --> 00:26:44,395
but I can back it up if you'll just
shut up for a minute.

375
00:26:45,367 --> 00:26:48,359
If your opinion is as rude as your
manner, I don't think I care to hear it.

376
00:26:48,527 --> 00:26:50,358
Oh, come on now. Simmer down.

377
00:26:50,527 --> 00:26:52,916
I can't fit in here. You can't fit in there.

378
00:26:53,087 --> 00:26:55,043
According to you, people
should be born, live and die

379
00:26:55,207 --> 00:26:57,118
- on the same spot!
- Shut up!

380
00:26:59,967 --> 00:27:03,926
- Did you ever eat fish heads and rice?
- Of course not.

381
00:27:04,087 --> 00:27:06,317
Well, you might have to
if you went with me.

382
00:27:06,487 --> 00:27:09,843
Did you ever try to keep warm
in a C-54 at 15,000 feet,

383
00:27:10,007 --> 00:27:11,998
20 degrees below zero?

384
00:27:12,167 --> 00:27:13,646
Oh, I do it all the time,

385
00:27:13,807 --> 00:27:15,559
whenever I have
a few minutes after lunch.

386
00:27:15,727 --> 00:27:17,604
Did you ever get shot at? Run over?

387
00:27:17,767 --> 00:27:18,882
Did you ever get sandbagged

388
00:27:19,047 --> 00:27:22,039
because somebody got unfavourable
publicity from your camera?

389
00:27:22,447 --> 00:27:25,086
Did you ever... Those high heels,
they'll be great in the jungle.

390
00:27:25,247 --> 00:27:27,158
And the nylons
and those six-ounce lingerie.

391
00:27:27,327 --> 00:27:28,965
- Three.
- Alright, three.

392
00:27:29,127 --> 00:27:32,119
They'll make a big hit in Finland,
just before you freeze to death.

393
00:27:32,287 --> 00:27:35,677
Well, if there's one thing I know,
it's how to wear the proper clothes.

394
00:27:35,847 --> 00:27:36,836
Yeah, yeah.

395
00:27:37,007 --> 00:27:40,522
Well, try and find a raincoat in Brazil,
even when it isn't raining.

396
00:27:40,687 --> 00:27:43,963
Lisa, in this job you carry one suitcase.

397
00:27:44,127 --> 00:27:46,402
Your home
is the available transportation.

398
00:27:46,567 --> 00:27:48,478
You don't sleep very much.
You bathe less.

399
00:27:48,647 --> 00:27:50,717
And sometimes the food that you eat

400
00:27:50,887 --> 00:27:53,640
is made from things that you couldn't
even look at when they're alive.

401
00:27:54,567 --> 00:27:57,877
Jeff, you don't have to be deliberately
repulsive just to impress me I'm wrong.

402
00:27:58,047 --> 00:28:00,845
Deliberately repulsive?
I'm trying to make it sound good.

403
00:28:01,007 --> 00:28:04,283
You just have to face it, Lisa,
you're not meant for that kind of a life.

404
00:28:04,567 --> 00:28:05,841
Few people are.

405
00:28:07,647 --> 00:28:12,562
- You're too stubborn to argue with.
- I'm not stubborn. I'm just truthful.

406
00:28:12,727 --> 00:28:16,083
I know, a lesser man would have
told me it was one long holiday,

407
00:28:16,247 --> 00:28:19,876
and I would have awakened
to a rude disillusionment.

408
00:28:20,047 --> 00:28:21,526
Well, now, wait a minute.

409
00:28:22,047 --> 00:28:25,801
If you want to get vicious on this thing,
I'd be happy to accommodate you.

410
00:28:28,447 --> 00:28:31,803
No, I don't particularly want that.

411
00:28:33,567 --> 00:28:34,886
So that's it?

412
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:37,197
You won't stay here,
and I can't go with you.

413
00:28:38,127 --> 00:28:39,765
It would be the wrong thing.

414
00:28:42,127 --> 00:28:44,595
You don't think either one
of us could ever change?

415
00:28:46,047 --> 00:28:48,038
Right now it doesn't seem so.

416
00:28:52,727 --> 00:28:54,365
I-I'm in love with you.

417
00:28:54,527 --> 00:28:57,963
I don't care what you do for a living.

418
00:28:58,127 --> 00:29:00,436
I'd like to be part of it somehow.

419
00:29:02,767 --> 00:29:05,565
It's deflating to find out
the only way I can be part of it,

420
00:29:05,727 --> 00:29:09,845
is to take out a subscription
to your magazine.

505
00:37:44,487 --> 00:37:46,284
when he's afraid somebody
might be watching him.

508
00:38:05,087 --> 00:38:07,317
He'll be after you.
Go on, into the house.

509
00:38:07,487 --> 00:38:09,478
Into the house. Shoo, shoo.

510
00:38:10,567 --> 00:38:12,797
Goodbye, Mr Jefferies.
See you tomorrow.

512
00:38:22,727 --> 00:38:25,639

- Uh-huh.

513
00:38:25,807 --> 00:38:30,323
"Uh-huh. Uh-huh."
Great conversationalist.

514
00:38:31,887 --> 00:38:33,206
Stella...

515
00:38:33,527 --> 00:38:37,486
Take those binoculars out
and bring them here, will you?

516
00:38:37,647 --> 00:38:39,126
Trouble.

517
00:38:39,287 --> 00:38:41,357
I can smell it.

518
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:44,405
I'll be glad when they crack
that cast, and I can get outta here.

519
00:38:44,567 --> 00:38:46,398
Uh-huh.

How far does a girl have to go

00:42:16,247 --> 00:42:19,876
Well, if she's pretty enough,
she doesn't have to go anywhere.

527
00:42:20,047 --> 00:42:22,003
She just has to 'be.'

528
00:42:22,167 --> 00:42:24,044
Well, ain't I?

529
00:42:24,207 --> 00:42:26,243
Pay attention to me.

I'm not exactly

Your mind is... and when
I want a man, I want all of him.

Don't you ever have any problems?

533
00:42:43,407 --> 00:42:45,443
I have one now.

So do I.

535
00:42:48,807 --> 00:42:51,002
Tell me about it.

536
00:42:52,927 --> 00:42:54,519
Why?

537
00:42:55,167 --> 00:42:58,443
Why would a man leave
his apartment three times

538
00:42:58,607 --> 00:43:03,317
on a rainy night with a suitcase,
and come back three times?

539
00:43:03,487 --> 00:43:07,196
He likes the way his wife
welcomes him home.

540
00:43:07,367 --> 00:43:09,881
No, no. Not this salesman's wife.

541
00:43:10,047 --> 00:43:11,958
And why didn't he go to work today?

542
00:43:12,127 --> 00:43:15,642
Homework. It's more interesting.

543
00:43:15,807 --> 00:43:20,119
What's interesting about a butcher knife

544
00:43:20,287 --> 00:43:22,676
and a small saw

545
00:43:23,127 --> 00:43:25,436
wrapped in newspaper?

546
00:43:25,607 --> 00:43:27,484
Nothing, thank heaven.

547
00:43:27,647 --> 00:43:30,445
Why hasn't he been
in his wife's bedroom all day?

548
00:43:30,607 --> 00:43:33,360
I wouldn't dare answer that.

549
00:43:34,047 --> 00:43:36,641
Well, listen. I'll answer it, Lisa.

550
00:43:36,807 --> 00:43:40,243
There's something terribly wrong.

551
00:43:42,127 --> 00:43:45,358
- <i>(Lisa) And I'm afraid it's with me,</i>
- What do you think?

552
00:43:46,887 --> 00:43:50,277
Something too frightful to utter.

553
00:43:50,447 --> 00:43:53,598
<i>(Jeff) He went out a few minutes</i>

00:44:06,687 --> 00:44:09,360

<i># (Piano)</i>

556
00:44:15,047 --> 00:44:17,607
Just how would you start
to cut up a human body?

557
00:44:20,567 --> 00:44:23,798
Jeff, I'll be honest with you.
You're beginning to scare me.

558
00:44:26,647 --> 00:44:30,196
Jeff, did you hear what I said?
You're beginning to scare -

559
00:44:30,367 --> 00:44:31,720
Shh! He's coming back!

560
00:44:59,287 --> 00:45:02,006
- Jeff, if you could only see yourself!
- What's the matter?

561
00:45:02,167 --> 00:45:04,556
Sitting around looking out of the
window to kill time is one thing,

562
00:45:04,727 --> 00:45:07,116
but doing it the way
you are with binoculars

563
00:45:07,287 --> 00:45:11,200
and wild opinions about every
little thing you see is diseased!

564
00:45:11,367 --> 00:45:13,722
Do you think I consider it recreation?

565
00:45:13,887 --> 00:45:15,639
I don't know what you consider it,

566
00:45:15,807 --> 00:45:17,877
but if you don't stop it,
I'm getting out of here.

567
00:45:18,047 --> 00:45:20,197
- What's the -
- What is it you're looking for?

568
00:45:20,367 --> 00:45:22,881
I just want to find out what's
the matter with the salesman's wife.

569
00:45:23,047 --> 00:45:24,685
Does that make me
sound like a madman?

570
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:26,485
What makes you think there's
something the matter with her?

571
00:45:26,647 --> 00:45:29,923
A lot of things. She's an invalid.
She demands constant care.

572
00:45:30,087 --> 00:45:35,320
Yet not the husband or anybody else
has been in to see her all day. Why?

573
00:45:35,847 --> 00:45:38,486
- Maybe she died.
- <i>(Jeff) Where's the doctor?</i>

574
00:45:38,647 --> 00:45:39,796
Where's the undertaker?

575
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:42,527
She could be sleeping, under sedatives.

576
00:45:42,687 --> 00:45:45,884
He's in there now.
There's nothing to see.

577
00:45:46,047 --> 00:45:47,958
There is something.
I've seen it through that window.

578
00:45:48,127 --> 00:45:50,880
I've seen bickering and family quarrels

579
00:45:51,047 --> 00:45:52,116
and mysterious trips at night

580
00:45:52,287 --> 00:45:54,039
and knives and saws and rope.

581
00:45:54,207 --> 00:45:57,165
Now, since last evening, not a sign
of the wife. Tell me where she is.

582
00:45:57,327 --> 00:45:58,999
- I don't know.
- What's she doing?

583
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:02,125
Maybe he's leaving his wife.
I don't know. I don't care!

584
00:46:02,287 --> 00:46:05,359
Lots of people have knives and saws
and ropes around their houses.

585
00:46:05,527 --> 00:46:08,087
And lots of men don't speak
to their wives all day.

586
00:46:08,247 --> 00:46:10,636
Lots of wives nag and
men hate them and trouble starts,

587
00:46:10,807 --> 00:46:14,561
but few of them end up in murder,
if that's what you're thinking.

588
00:46:14,727 --> 00:46:16,957
It's pretty hard for you to keep
away from that word, isn't it?

589
00:46:17,127 --> 00:46:19,083
You could see all that he did,
couldn't you?

590
00:46:19,247 --> 00:46:21,283
- Of course, I -
- You could see cos the shades were up

591
00:46:21,527 --> 00:46:24,917
and he walked along the corridor
and the street and the backyard.

592
00:46:25,087 --> 00:46:26,076
I've seen him -

593
00:46:26,247 --> 00:46:28,841
Jeff, do you think a murderer
would let you see all that?

594
00:46:29,007 --> 00:46:31,726
That he wouldn't pull the shades
down and hide behind them?

595
00:46:31,887 --> 00:46:33,764
He's being clever. He's being nonchalant.

596
00:46:33,927 --> 00:46:35,963
And that's
where you're not bring clever.

597
00:46:36,127 --> 00:46:39,278
A murderer would never parade
his crime in front of an open window.

598
00:46:39,447 --> 00:46:40,436
Why not?

599
00:46:40,607 --> 00:46:43,883
For all you know, there's
something sinister going on there.

600
00:46:44,807 --> 00:46:47,116
Where? Oh.

601
00:46:48,407 --> 00:46:50,716
(Laughs) No comment.

602
00:47:12,287 --> 00:47:15,962
Let's start
from the beginning again, Jeff.

603
00:47:16,127 --> 00:47:19,039
Tell me everything you saw

604
00:47:19,207 --> 00:47:22,279
and what you think it means.

605
00:47:32,847 --> 00:47:34,485
- <i>(Telephone Rings)</i>

<i>"Alright, but what's he doing now?"</i>

616
00:47:57,567 --> 00:48:01,242
He's just sitting
in the living room in the dark.

617
00:48:01,407 --> 00:48:03,875
Hasn't gone near the bedroom.

618
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:06,800
Now you go home
and get some sleep. Good night.

621
00:48:18,607 --> 00:48:21,519
Look, Doyle,
I can't tell you over the phone.

622
00:48:21,687 --> 00:48:23,962
You have to be here
and see the whole set-up.

623
00:48:24,127 --> 00:48:28,200
It's probably nothing.
It's just a little neighbourhood murder.

624
00:48:28,367 --> 00:48:31,279
- <i>(doyle) 'Did you say murder?'</i>
- Yes, as a matter of fact, I did.

625
00:48:31,447 --> 00:48:32,516
<i>(doyle) "Oh, come now,"</i>

626
00:48:32,687 --> 00:48:35,155
My only thought was throwing a little
business your way, that's all.

627
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:38,478
I figured a detective would jump at
the chance of something to detect.

628
00:48:38,647 --> 00:48:40,285
- <i>(doyle) "I'm not working,"</i>
- What?

<i>"This happens to be my day off,"</i>

630

633
00:48:51,767 --> 00:48:53,359
Gee whiz, look at this.

634
00:48:53,527 --> 00:48:55,802
I can't tell you
what a welcome sight this is.

635
00:48:55,967 --> 00:48:57,366
No wonder your husband still loves you.

636
00:48:57,527 --> 00:48:58,926
- The police.
- What?

637
00:48:59,087 --> 00:49:02,124
- You called the police.
- Well, not exactly.

638
00:49:02,287 --> 00:49:05,438
Not an official call.
It's an old friend of mine.

639
00:49:05,607 --> 00:49:08,565
An old, ornery friend of mine.

640
00:49:08,727 --> 00:49:12,800
Just where do you suppose
he cut her up?

641
00:49:12,967 --> 00:49:16,198
Of course. The bathtub.

642
00:49:16,367 --> 00:49:21,282
That's the only place where
he could have washed away the blood.
