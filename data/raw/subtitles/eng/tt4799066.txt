00:00:55,841 --> 00:00:57,840
<b>Resync of explosiveskull's</b>

2
00:00:57,841 --> 00:00:59,708
I have this reoccurring dream.

3
00:01:00,942 --> 00:01:03,507
I'm a little
girl sitting with my mom,

4
00:01:03,508 --> 00:01:06,540
and she's singing to me.

5
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:09,507
I feel the warmth
of the sun on my skin

6
00:01:09,508 --> 00:01:11,276
and the comfort of her arms
around me.

7
00:01:12,607 --> 00:01:14,808
And I wanna stay there.

8
00:01:15,675 --> 00:01:17,607
Forever.

9
00:01:17,608 --> 00:01:21,208
When I wake up,
I miss the dream.

10
00:01:21,209 --> 00:01:24,008
I want so badly
for this dream to be real,

11
00:01:24,009 --> 00:01:26,674
but that would be impossible

12
00:01:26,675 --> 00:01:29,773
because my mom died
when I was really little.

13
00:01:29,774 --> 00:01:31,741
And I can't go out in the sun.

14
00:01:31,742 --> 00:01:33,441
Like, at all.

15
00:01:33,442 --> 00:01:37,873
I have a rare genetic condition
called Xeroderma Pigmentosum,

16
00:01:37,874 --> 00:01:41,473
or XP, which basically means

17
00:01:41,474 --> 00:01:43,640
a severe sensitivity
to sunlight.

18
00:01:43,641 --> 00:01:46,141
If the sun hits my skin,
I get skin cancer,

19
00:01:46,142 --> 00:01:48,908
my brain starts to fail
and I could die.

20
00:01:49,474 --> 00:01:51,207
Pretty fun, right?

21
00:01:51,208 --> 00:01:55,073
So, I spend all my time indoors
behind special windows,

22
00:01:55,074 --> 00:01:59,074
hanging out with my dad
who is the best dad ever.

23
00:01:59,075 --> 00:02:01,207
Thank goodness,
because growing up,

24
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:04,073
kids were, what you'd expect.

25
00:02:04,074 --> 00:02:06,175
- No way.
- Yep, a vampire.

26
00:02:06,176 --> 00:02:08,074
That's why they have
special windows.

27
00:02:08,075 --> 00:02:10,174
Don't worry. She can't
get us during the day.

28
00:02:10,175 --> 00:02:13,973
But at night,
stay far, far away.

29
00:02:13,974 --> 00:02:16,075
But not everyone
was afraid of me.

30
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:20,808
- Hey, Morgan.
- What's wrong with her?

31
00:02:23,742 --> 00:02:26,774
She has something called XP.

32
00:02:26,775 --> 00:02:31,342
Basically, the light from
the sun, it-it hurts her.

33
00:02:32,608 --> 00:02:34,908
So she can't ever go in the sun.

34
00:02:34,909 --> 00:02:37,175
I can't be in the sun
for too long either.

35
00:02:37,176 --> 00:02:39,673
Can she play at night?

36
00:02:39,674 --> 00:02:41,675
- Yeah, but...
- See you tonight.

37
00:02:42,508 --> 00:02:44,641
And I like pizza!

38
00:02:44,642 --> 00:02:46,673
From that point on,

39
00:02:46,674 --> 00:02:49,108
it was me, Morgan and my dad.

40
00:02:49,109 --> 00:02:53,107
Until one day, I saw Charlie.

41
00:02:53,108 --> 00:02:55,441
And that was it.

42
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:58,141
I was completely,
totally, utterly hooked.

43
00:02:58,142 --> 00:03:00,206
Stupid tree.

44
00:03:00,207 --> 00:03:02,041
I saw him every day.

45
00:03:02,042 --> 00:03:04,943
And yet,
he had no idea I even existed.

46
00:03:06,442 --> 00:03:08,440
Over time,
watching Charlie go by

47
00:03:08,441 --> 00:03:10,275
just became
a part of my routine.

48
00:03:11,842 --> 00:03:13,976
Along with constant
doctor appointments.

49
00:03:15,507 --> 00:03:17,941
Sleeping during the day
and staying up all night,

50
00:03:17,942 --> 00:03:20,641
which, from what I've heard,

51
00:03:20,642 --> 00:03:22,641
is the schedule
of most teenagers.

52
00:03:22,642 --> 00:03:26,673
And playing music
every chance I get.

53
00:03:26,674 --> 00:03:29,674
All things considered,
I've got a pretty great life.

54
00:03:29,675 --> 00:03:32,140
But I still hold onto my dreams.

55
00:03:32,141 --> 00:03:34,606
Stupid tree.

56
00:03:34,607 --> 00:03:36,774
No matter
how impossible they may seem.

57
00:03:36,775 --> 00:03:38,073
"They're not gonna break us"

58
00:03:38,074 --> 00:03:40,506
"Hey, we'll burn so bright"

59
00:03:40,507 --> 00:03:42,807
"Making all the people
Come to life"

60
00:03:42,808 --> 00:03:45,207
"Hey, the darkest sky"

61
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:47,141
"Can't stop me and you Tonight"

62
00:03:47,142 --> 00:03:50,041
"I said hey
We'll burn so bright"

63
00:03:50,042 --> 00:03:52,474
"Dancing underneath
The city lights"

64
00:03:52,475 --> 00:03:54,807
"Hey, from way up high"

65
00:03:54,808 --> 00:03:56,975
"Shining down
Like stars tonight"

66
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:03,972
Jeremy Pierce.

67
00:04:05,607 --> 00:04:07,007
Kendall Porter.

68
00:04:07,008 --> 00:04:08,140
Congratulations.

69
00:04:08,141 --> 00:04:09,676
Peter Rathbard.

70
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:13,640
- Charles Reed.
- Yeah, Charlie!

71
00:04:14,608 --> 00:04:16,243
Congratulations, Charlie.

72
00:04:17,175 --> 00:04:18,943
Katie Price!

73
00:04:22,841 --> 00:04:23,908
What are you wearing?

74
00:04:23,909 --> 00:04:26,874
Cap and gown.

75
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:28,676
The faculty and staff
always wear one.

76
00:04:29,475 --> 00:04:30,773
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

77
00:04:32,542 --> 00:04:34,541
Most importantly,
this is for you.

78
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:39,675
I assume, as valedictorian,
you have a speech prepared. Yes?

79
00:04:40,207 --> 00:04:44,173
Um, yes.

80
00:04:44,174 --> 00:04:45,641
That's me putting on my glasses.

81
00:04:45,642 --> 00:04:47,106
- I like that. Nice touch.
- Thank you.

82
00:04:47,107 --> 00:04:50,540
Um, first, I would
like to thank my headmaster.

83
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:52,673
- Well, I mean...
- My Spanish teacher.

84
00:04:52,674 --> 00:04:54,008
De nada.

85
00:04:54,009 --> 00:04:56,841
- My English teacher.
- It was my pleasure.

86
00:04:56,842 --> 00:04:58,707
But I really wanna
state for the record

87
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:02,074
that my gym teacher had absolutely
no idea what he was doing...

88
00:05:02,075 --> 00:05:05,808
What? You suck.
I lift weights.

89
00:05:05,809 --> 00:05:07,176
Hey, this is for you.

90
00:05:12,008 --> 00:05:14,706
This is one of the lamest things
I've ever seen.

91
00:05:14,707 --> 00:05:16,607
Yes!

92
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:18,841
I had to go to three stores
to find something this lame.

93
00:05:18,842 --> 00:05:21,072
- I mean, it's horrific.
- Yeah! It's the worst.

94
00:05:21,073 --> 00:05:22,140
Yeah.

95
00:05:22,141 --> 00:05:23,841
All right.

96
00:05:23,842 --> 00:05:25,841
Are you ready for your present?

97
00:05:25,842 --> 00:05:27,741
- There's a present involved?
- There's a present, yes!

98
00:05:27,742 --> 00:05:29,474
Of course, there's a present.
It's graduation...

99
00:05:29,475 --> 00:05:31,115
This just keeps getting
better and better.

100
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:43,208
This is Mom's.

101
00:05:53,809 --> 00:05:55,741
Look, I know it's kind of old,

102
00:05:55,742 --> 00:05:57,673
so if you want a newer one
I totally under...

103
00:05:57,674 --> 00:06:00,208
No, I love it!
Thank you. Thank you so much.

104
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,708
You look just like your mother.

105
00:06:10,841 --> 00:06:12,676
Lucky you.
She was hot.

106
00:06:13,475 --> 00:06:14,641
Ew.

107
00:06:14,642 --> 00:06:17,109
Try and get some sleep.
All right?

108
00:06:42,775 --> 00:06:45,174
I can't believe this is happening.

109
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:57,709
Ooh.

110
00:06:59,008 --> 00:07:00,473
That's a good one.

111
00:07:00,474 --> 00:07:03,171
Something weird's
going on right here.

112
00:07:05,641 --> 00:07:08,640
Hey, Dad, um...
I was wondering

113
00:07:08,641 --> 00:07:10,573
if I could go play
my new beautiful present

114
00:07:10,574 --> 00:07:11,975
at the train station tonight.

115
00:07:14,575 --> 00:07:16,574
It's 10:00.

116
00:07:16,575 --> 00:07:18,673
Why can't Morgan just come over?
You could play here for me.

117
00:07:18,674 --> 00:07:20,106
Morgan's busy with her family.

118
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:22,907
And, Dad, I love playing
for you, I really do,

119
00:07:22,908 --> 00:07:25,039
but I also need
to get used to playing

120
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,006
in front of other people too.

121
00:07:27,007 --> 00:07:28,473
Please, please, please.

122
00:07:28,474 --> 00:07:30,640
Fred will be there.
He'll watch out for me.

123
00:07:30,641 --> 00:07:32,140
And I graduated today!

124
00:07:32,141 --> 00:07:35,742
Isn't that the American
tradition, to extend my curfew?

125
00:07:38,941 --> 00:07:41,573
Okay, I'll extend
your curfew one hour.

126
00:07:41,574 --> 00:07:43,773
Which means midnight, okay?

127
00:07:43,774 --> 00:07:45,173
Hey, and text me
right when you get there,

128
00:07:45,174 --> 00:07:46,540
or I'm not just gonna call Fred,

129
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:47,707
I'm actually
gonna come down there.

130
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:50,139
And it will be so embarrassing,
it'll become urban legend

131
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:52,905
- on why kids should stick to their curfew!
- I love you.

132
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:05,573
"Come to me, baby
Don't be shy, don't be shy"

133
00:08:05,574 --> 00:08:06,640
"Don't be shy"

134
00:08:06,641 --> 00:08:09,574
"Come to me, baby Don't be shy"

135
00:08:09,575 --> 00:08:10,773
Boy.

136
00:08:10,774 --> 00:08:13,573
"It was the summertime"

137
00:08:13,574 --> 00:08:15,207
"Summertime"

138
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:18,474
Hey, don't do that thing.

139
00:08:18,475 --> 00:08:19,807
What thing?

140
00:08:19,808 --> 00:08:23,440
That. I mean, you look all sad
and it makes me sad.

141
00:08:23,441 --> 00:08:25,072
Please just chug this beer
and come hang out!

142
00:08:25,073 --> 00:08:27,039
Dude, you dodged a bullet, man.

143
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,840
You were gonna be up at the ass
crack of dawn every morning

144
00:08:29,841 --> 00:08:32,440
taking tests,
nowhere near the beach.

145
00:08:32,441 --> 00:08:34,972
And now, we get to do this...
our whole lives.

146
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:38,574
I forgot,
doing this our whole lives,

147
00:08:38,575 --> 00:08:40,335
it's way better
than a full ride to Berkeley.

148
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,207
Zoe Carmichael. 3:00.

149
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:49,173
- Charlie... you're in trouble.
- What did I do this time?

150
00:08:49,174 --> 00:08:50,740
You didn't get me a drink.

151
00:08:50,741 --> 00:08:52,541
I did not know you were thirsty.

152
00:08:52,542 --> 00:08:53,808
Now you do.

153
00:08:55,641 --> 00:08:57,575
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

154
00:08:58,141 --> 00:08:59,576
Is that the bad one?

155
00:09:00,607 --> 00:09:02,707
Well, now that
you're not swimming,

156
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:06,139
maybe you'll have
a little extra time for me.

157
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,939
I also have some
extra time for you.

158
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:09,873
- And I'm not swimming.
- You were never swimming, idiot.

159
00:09:09,874 --> 00:09:11,541
Zoe! Get over here, bitch!

160
00:09:11,542 --> 00:09:13,207
Hold on!

161
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:14,840
You're coming to
my graduation party, right?

162
00:09:14,841 --> 00:09:16,107
Yeah, I think so.

163
00:09:16,108 --> 00:09:17,241
Good.

164
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:20,008
Yeah!

165
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,908
What... What are you doing?

166
00:09:24,674 --> 00:09:26,007
Dodging another bullet.

167
00:09:26,008 --> 00:09:28,506
Come on, dude.
It's our graduation night.

168
00:09:28,507 --> 00:09:29,708
I'm not feeling it, boys.

169
00:09:30,441 --> 00:09:31,808
I'll see you later.

170
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:35,675
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

171
00:09:39,107 --> 00:09:40,541
Hey, yo, Fred.

172
00:09:40,542 --> 00:09:41,872
I was wondering if I was
gonna see you tonight.

173
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:44,338
What, and disappoint
all my fans?

174
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:06,940
"While you're fast asleep"

175
00:10:06,941 --> 00:10:08,206
"Counting your sheep"

176
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:10,074
"I'm breathin'"

177
00:10:14,008 --> 00:10:15,773
"I'll be up all night"

178
00:10:15,774 --> 00:10:18,342
"Playing through
This twilight dream"

179
00:10:22,607 --> 00:10:23,973
"'Cause all my life"

180
00:10:23,974 --> 00:10:27,007
"I have been Patiently waiting"

181
00:10:31,475 --> 00:10:36,206
"For lights to dim
To fulfill my destiny"

182
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:40,974
"I'll keep reaching"

183
00:10:42,807 --> 00:10:47,206
"As far as I can
Till break of day"

184
00:10:47,207 --> 00:10:49,741
"I'll keep reaching"

185
00:10:51,674 --> 00:10:55,940
"The light of my life
Will find its way"

186
00:10:55,941 --> 00:10:58,807
"I know if I reach too far"

187
00:10:58,808 --> 00:11:02,075
"I may not ever recover"

188
00:11:05,073 --> 00:11:07,607
"But I know the stars"

189
00:11:07,608 --> 00:11:10,975
"Ain't all I'm meant
To discover"

190
00:11:12,907 --> 00:11:15,741
"So I'll keep reaching"

191
00:11:21,773 --> 00:11:24,973
"I know if I reach too far"

192
00:11:24,974 --> 00:11:28,676
"I may not ever recover"

193
00:11:31,141 --> 00:11:33,907
"But I know the stars"

194
00:11:33,908 --> 00:11:37,741
"Ain't all
I'm meant to discover"

195
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:41,174
"So I'll keep rea..."

196
00:11:41,774 --> 00:11:43,075
Hey.

197
00:11:49,608 --> 00:11:51,573
I didn't mean to freak you out.

198
00:11:51,574 --> 00:11:52,808
Here.

199
00:11:54,807 --> 00:11:57,441
Me? I'm not freaked out.
Don't worry about it.

200
00:11:57,442 --> 00:11:59,073
- Here, I'll help you.
- I'm not a freak.

201
00:11:59,074 --> 00:12:01,506
Why are you packing up?
Where are you going?

202
00:12:01,507 --> 00:12:03,507
Um, home.
I gotta go home.

203
00:12:03,508 --> 00:12:05,808
Home? Wait, you live here?

204
00:12:06,808 --> 00:12:08,139
Wait, you didn't
go to Purdue High.

205
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:10,473
No. It's a very
different school.

206
00:12:10,474 --> 00:12:13,906
And I graduated today and
my dad's a super big worrier.

207
00:12:13,907 --> 00:12:16,241
So, I really gotta...
God.

208
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,739
- Um...
- I have to go.

209
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:26,241
Wait! Wait! What...
I'm sorry, why are you...

210
00:12:27,542 --> 00:12:28,507
What's the rush? What...

211
00:12:28,508 --> 00:12:31,474
Um, I have to get home
to my cat.

212
00:12:31,475 --> 00:12:34,207
- Your cat.
- Yeah, it died.

213
00:12:36,706 --> 00:12:39,207
So, you're not
in a rush then, right?

214
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:41,940
No, no, I am.
I have to plan the funeral

215
00:12:41,941 --> 00:12:45,540
for my, um, dead cat that died.

216
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:47,274
Yeah, it's super dead.

217
00:12:50,007 --> 00:12:51,676
Wait! Wait! Wait!

218
00:12:53,007 --> 00:12:54,241
I didn't even get your name!

219
00:13:11,074 --> 00:13:14,207
You haven't noticed any changes in
her? Motor functions still seem strong?

220
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:16,872
Yeah. Yeah, no loss
of intellectual function,

221
00:13:16,873 --> 00:13:20,007
no difficulty swallowing
or talking.

222
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:21,973
Believe me on that.

223
00:13:21,974 --> 00:13:25,541
And no corneal ulcerations.

224
00:13:25,542 --> 00:13:29,342
Really, there's nothing to
suggest any neurodegeneration.

225
00:13:30,574 --> 00:13:31,972
Any exposure to sunlight?

226
00:13:31,973 --> 00:13:33,907
No, of course not.

227
00:13:35,108 --> 00:13:37,140
I'm gonna refill her
prescription for you this time,

228
00:13:37,141 --> 00:13:39,642
but she really should be coming
to these appointments with you.

229
00:13:40,508 --> 00:13:42,639
Yeah, well, you know teenagers.

230
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,000
They get embarrassed
by their dads.

231
00:13:45,141 --> 00:13:48,173
- She has XP, Jack.
- I know exactly what she has.

232
00:13:48,174 --> 00:13:49,705
It's not gonna
fall into remission.

233
00:13:49,706 --> 00:13:52,140
And every year, the risk
becomes more serious for her.

234
00:13:52,141 --> 00:13:54,507
So, if she's exposed to even
the slightest bit of sunlight...

235
00:13:54,508 --> 00:13:56,840
She won't be.

236
00:13:56,841 --> 00:13:59,675
- She's reached that age we talked about.
- She won't be.

237
00:14:02,941 --> 00:14:05,839
Any word on the University
of Washington study?

238
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:09,939
I submitted Katie's name for their Phase
Two trials, if it even gets that far.

239
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:12,072
I wouldn't get your hopes up.

240
00:14:12,073 --> 00:14:13,940
Research funding
being what it is,

241
00:14:13,941 --> 00:14:16,941
we're talking about a disease that
affects only one in a million people.

242
00:14:19,973 --> 00:14:22,941
We're in luck,
'cause she is one in a million.

243
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,208
A cat funeral?

244
00:14:30,074 --> 00:14:31,840
Please stop saying it out loud.

245
00:14:31,841 --> 00:14:34,473
No, I mean,
I've heard that dead pets

246
00:14:34,474 --> 00:14:35,940
can actually be an aphrodisiac.

247
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:38,440
Morgan, what should I have said?

248
00:14:38,441 --> 00:14:40,873
Any other combination of words
in the English language.

249
00:14:40,874 --> 00:14:42,839
Like, "Hey, I'm Katie Price."

250
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,006
I've watched you outside
my window for the past 10 years,

251
00:14:45,007 --> 00:14:48,107
"and I've been in love with you,
stalking you every minute of the day."

252
00:14:48,108 --> 00:14:51,705
- Okay, don't start with that...
- Or how about, "Hey, you may remember me from kindergarten,"

253
00:14:51,706 --> 00:14:53,174
when everyone
called me a vampire."

254
00:14:53,175 --> 00:14:55,072
No one remembers that!

255
00:14:55,073 --> 00:14:58,140
- What did I do?
- It's bad, but we'll fix it.

256
00:14:58,141 --> 00:15:01,640
I feel so stupid and lame.

257
00:15:01,641 --> 00:15:03,342
Well, at least
you have M&M's. So...

258
00:15:05,974 --> 00:15:07,208
Thanks.

259
00:15:09,442 --> 00:15:12,007
So, you've just gotta
make up for it next time.

260
00:15:12,008 --> 00:15:13,639
There's not gonna be
a next time.

261
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,675
- You don't know that.
- I do.

262
00:15:16,807 --> 00:15:18,873
This is good.
This is what Taylor Swift does.

263
00:15:18,874 --> 00:15:20,573
She has awkward
interactions with boys,

264
00:15:20,574 --> 00:15:23,940
and then she just writes
amazing songs about it. What?

265
00:15:23,941 --> 00:15:26,140
No, no.

266
00:15:26,141 --> 00:15:28,907
- Come on.
- What's happening?

267
00:15:28,908 --> 00:15:30,173
Did you see my notebook
when you came in?

268
00:15:30,174 --> 00:15:32,505
Your notebook notebook? No.

269
00:15:32,506 --> 00:15:33,972
I think I left it
at the train station.

270
00:15:33,973 --> 00:15:36,772
- God.
- Can you please go get it for me?

271
00:15:36,773 --> 00:15:38,940
Morgan, it's so important.
Please.

272
00:15:38,941 --> 00:15:41,606
You know, I would,
but there's, like,

273
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:44,075
a few other poppin' cat funerals
that I was gonna hit today.

274
00:15:44,874 --> 00:15:46,975
No, no! I'm in a corner!!

275
00:15:57,174 --> 00:15:58,940
Hey.

276
00:15:58,941 --> 00:16:00,207
My friend's
been looking for that.

277
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:01,941
You know her? Wait.

278
00:16:03,073 --> 00:16:05,040
Morgan, right?
We had English class together.

279
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:08,639
- I'm Charlie...
- Charlie Reed, yeah. I know.

280
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,006
And it was a history class.

281
00:16:10,007 --> 00:16:11,207
But how do you know her?

282
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:13,007
- Did she just move here?
- Notebook first.

283
00:16:13,008 --> 00:16:16,708
Or you could just tell me where she
lives and I could drop it off.

284
00:16:17,908 --> 00:16:19,174
I have a better idea.

285
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:26,539
Hey, Dad, I need to go to the train
station to pick up my notebook.

286
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:27,806
Fred has it.

287
00:16:27,807 --> 00:16:29,975
Okay, text me when you get there
and be careful.

288
00:16:38,674 --> 00:16:39,807
Fred?

289
00:16:44,108 --> 00:16:46,605
Holy pregnant cow.

290
00:16:46,606 --> 00:16:48,740
My God.
My God.

291
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:50,006
My God.

292
00:16:50,007 --> 00:16:51,640
Thank you.

293
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:56,705
Purdue Creamery.

294
00:16:56,706 --> 00:16:59,773
- Morgan.
- Hey. How's your second date?

295
00:16:59,774 --> 00:17:01,206
How could you do this to me?

296
00:17:01,207 --> 00:17:02,540
My God, I'm in sweatpants.

297
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:05,639
My hair, it's-it's a mess.
It's tied.

298
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,473
My God, I look like an idiot.

299
00:17:07,474 --> 00:17:10,440
Please. Katie,
you're super freakin' hot, okay?

300
00:17:10,441 --> 00:17:12,706
I can't even see you right now and
I can tell you look gorgeous.

301
00:17:12,707 --> 00:17:14,072
Hi, excuse me.
Can I just get a large...

302
00:17:14,073 --> 00:17:15,907
Can you not see
I'm on the phone?

303
00:17:17,773 --> 00:17:20,106
He really likes you, okay?
I can tell.

304
00:17:20,107 --> 00:17:22,840
Just try to be yourself.
Don't ramble too much.

305
00:17:22,841 --> 00:17:24,306
And call me afterwards.

306
00:17:25,974 --> 00:17:27,107
Bye.

307
00:17:32,606 --> 00:17:34,807
My...

308
00:17:46,108 --> 00:17:48,007
You exist.

309
00:17:48,008 --> 00:17:50,672
I thought I was dreaming
last night or something.

310
00:17:50,673 --> 00:17:53,505
Were you in the REM
stage of sleep?

311
00:17:53,506 --> 00:17:54,639
What?

312
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,139
That's when most
dreams happen, actually.

313
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:00,506
Yeah, your brain activity
is super high and functioning,

314
00:18:00,507 --> 00:18:03,639
and your eyes are just going
nuts behind your eyelids.

315
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:07,140
It looks super weird. It's like
a typewriter or something.

316
00:18:07,141 --> 00:18:09,806
Um, anyway, thank you for...

317
00:18:09,807 --> 00:18:12,072
Wait, I, I still
don't know your name.

318
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:16,738
- It's Katie.
- Katie, I'm Charlie.

319
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,039
That's a weird name.

320
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,973
Thank God you told me it 'cause I
wouldn't have known it otherwise.

321
00:18:22,974 --> 00:18:24,807
Thank you.

322
00:18:24,808 --> 00:18:26,575
- Wait, what...
- You didn't...

323
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:31,840
You didn't read through it,
did you?

324
00:18:31,841 --> 00:18:33,540
Just a little. I...

325
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:34,740
- What?
- What?

326
00:18:34,741 --> 00:18:36,705
Are you serious?
You read through my journal?

327
00:18:36,706 --> 00:18:38,539
- Look, I...
- This could have been a diary.

328
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,140
I mean, it is, kind of.

329
00:18:40,141 --> 00:18:42,072
Um, I'm... I'm really sorry.

330
00:18:42,073 --> 00:18:44,072
You left really quick
the other night,

331
00:18:44,073 --> 00:18:45,673
and I really had no idea
who it belonged to,

332
00:18:45,674 --> 00:18:47,073
so I just
looked through it quickly.

333
00:18:47,074 --> 00:18:49,173
But I like that you
still handwrite things.

334
00:18:49,174 --> 00:18:51,274
It's... It's cool.
It's old school.

335
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:56,173
Thanks... for finding it.

336
00:18:56,174 --> 00:18:57,342
Yeah.

337
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:00,973
Wait!

338
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:02,572
What, another cat died?
You have to...

339
00:19:03,674 --> 00:19:05,739
Um...

340
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:10,006
I... I had to... I... I'm...
I'm walking home.

341
00:19:10,007 --> 00:19:11,207
Can I walk with you?

342
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:15,106
Um, yeah.

343
00:19:15,107 --> 00:19:18,439
So, you were home-schooled?
Man, that must have been wild.

344
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:21,206
Actually, it was the exact
opposite of wild.

345
00:19:21,207 --> 00:19:23,440
My dad's pretty protective.

346
00:19:23,441 --> 00:19:26,573
He's not, like, watching us
right now, is he?

347
00:19:26,574 --> 00:19:29,872
Yeah. He has his phone
tapped into every camera.

348
00:19:32,473 --> 00:19:36,206
So, um, what did you think
of the songs you read?

349
00:19:36,207 --> 00:19:39,505
Without my permission,
I may add.

350
00:19:39,506 --> 00:19:42,008
Um, honestly, I don't know.

351
00:19:43,107 --> 00:19:44,873
I mean, you can't really
read a song, right?

352
00:19:44,874 --> 00:19:46,173
True.

353
00:19:46,174 --> 00:19:48,907
I guess I'd have
to hear you sing them.

354
00:19:48,908 --> 00:19:51,906
Um, so anyway,
I'm right up here.

355
00:19:51,907 --> 00:19:53,974
So, you don't have to walk me.

356
00:19:55,473 --> 00:19:57,639
Wait, you live up there?

357
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,205
I-I don't understand
how we've never met.

358
00:19:59,206 --> 00:20:00,705
I've probably
skated by your house,

359
00:20:00,706 --> 00:20:02,039
like, every day
on the way to practice.

360
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:06,272
It's a... funny coincidence.

361
00:20:08,706 --> 00:20:09,942
Um...

362
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:12,174
thanks.

363
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,974
Hey, you wouldn't wanna do
something sometime, would you?

364
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:21,506
Um... together?

365
00:20:21,507 --> 00:20:24,342
Yes, us together.
Hanging out.

366
00:20:25,574 --> 00:20:29,207
Um... I'm really busy
during the day.

367
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:34,342
But... I could be free at night.

368
00:20:35,573 --> 00:20:37,072
I could be free at night.

369
00:20:37,073 --> 00:20:40,340
Well, you should
put your number in here then.

370
00:20:43,473 --> 00:20:45,540
I'm old school too.

371
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:46,907
Smooth.

372
00:20:47,773 --> 00:20:49,207
Thank you.

373
00:20:53,673 --> 00:20:56,640
That is so romantic
it disgusts me.

374
00:20:58,139 --> 00:20:59,639
What did he say about your XP?

375
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,672
It didn't come up.

376
00:21:01,673 --> 00:21:03,473
What do you mean,
it didn't come up?

377
00:21:03,474 --> 00:21:05,540
I-I didn't bring it up.

378
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:07,473
I'm not gonna just
randomly be like,

379
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:10,938
"Hey, dude, by the way,
the sunlight's gonna..."

380
00:21:11,973 --> 00:21:15,205
Like, look when you
tell someone you're sick,

381
00:21:15,206 --> 00:21:19,940
then you start to become more like
a disease and less like a person.

382
00:21:19,941 --> 00:21:22,539
It's... I'm gonna tell him,
I promise,

383
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:24,673
but I don't know
when I'm gonna see him again.

384
00:21:24,674 --> 00:21:26,639
I do.

385
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,972
You know that annoying guy who works
with me at the ice cream shop?

386
00:21:28,973 --> 00:21:32,007
- The nerdy one you hate?
- Yes, Garver.

387
00:21:32,008 --> 00:21:34,807
His parents are out of town tonight
and he's throwing a party.

388
00:21:34,808 --> 00:21:36,639
And he told me to bring friends.

389
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,073
- So, I'm gonna bring you...
- No, no, no, no, no...

390
00:21:39,074 --> 00:21:41,640
- And you're gonna bring Charlie.
- No.

391
00:21:41,641 --> 00:21:44,473
He's gotta, like, you know...

392
00:21:44,474 --> 00:21:47,873
Doesn't... I have to wait
till he texts me first, right?

393
00:21:47,874 --> 00:21:49,706
Yeah, totally.

394
00:21:49,707 --> 00:21:52,439
And then, you know, his squire will
send a note via carrier pigeon

395
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,973
asking if you'd like
to merge your kingdoms.

396
00:21:53,974 --> 00:21:55,973
What is this,
18th-century England?

397
00:21:55,974 --> 00:21:57,772
You're a hot,
young, badass woman.

398
00:21:57,773 --> 00:22:00,174
You're gonna text him
whenever you damn well please.

399
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,107
Be confident, okay?

400
00:22:03,908 --> 00:22:05,840
- Give him the facts.
- Okay.

401
00:22:15,941 --> 00:22:18,671
- Play a little hard to get.
- All right.

402
00:22:21,573 --> 00:22:23,907
Make sure that he knows he's not
the only reason you're going.

403
00:22:23,908 --> 00:22:25,506
Okay.

404
00:22:25,507 --> 00:22:26,908
All right.

405
00:22:28,941 --> 00:22:30,237
No.

406
00:22:38,606 --> 00:22:41,071
This is gonna be a tame,
safe, parent-friendly party.

407
00:22:41,072 --> 00:22:42,973
Ha!
It's a totally lame party.

408
00:22:42,974 --> 00:22:44,940
You know what we should do?
We should stay here.

409
00:22:44,941 --> 00:22:48,038
We'll get Hunan Chinese.
You guys love Hunan, right?

410
00:22:48,039 --> 00:22:49,740
Put some Netflix on.
It'll be perfect.

411
00:22:51,107 --> 00:22:53,138
Dad, you know I'm a good kid.

412
00:22:53,139 --> 00:22:54,940
You know I'm not gonna
do anything crazy.

413
00:22:54,941 --> 00:22:57,605
But I swear,
if I spend one more night here,

414
00:22:57,606 --> 00:23:00,071
just listening to everyone else
outside my window

415
00:23:00,072 --> 00:23:03,273
living their lives,
I might go crazy.

416
00:23:05,874 --> 00:23:10,075
Tomorrow night, we can order way too much
chow mein, and have a movie marathon.

417
00:23:14,206 --> 00:23:16,672
- All right.
- Yes, thank you!

418
00:23:16,673 --> 00:23:18,573
You're the best dad
in the world.

419
00:23:18,574 --> 00:23:20,505
Thanks, Mr. P!

420
00:23:20,506 --> 00:23:24,440
Okay, um, Charlie's gonna
meet us at Garver's at 8:00.

421
00:23:24,441 --> 00:23:25,672
We have to get ready!

422
00:23:25,673 --> 00:23:26,872
Dude, what are you
talking about?

423
00:23:26,873 --> 00:23:28,975
We have, like, three hours.

424
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,273
We're already behind.

425
00:23:33,206 --> 00:23:34,240
Done.

426
00:23:36,106 --> 00:23:41,574
Mr. P! May I present
Katherine Price of Washington.

427
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:58,872
Peanut... you look amazing.

428
00:23:58,873 --> 00:24:00,606
"I'll drink your wine"

429
00:24:00,607 --> 00:24:02,971
Bye, Mr. P!

430
00:24:02,972 --> 00:24:06,038
"I'll spin your clocks
And I'll gut your fish"

431
00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:09,606
"I'll fuck you blind
And make a run for it"

432
00:24:09,607 --> 00:24:10,841
Let's go.

433
00:24:18,674 --> 00:24:20,942
God, I can't believe
Garver's throwing a kegger.

434
00:24:22,773 --> 00:24:24,170
You came.

435
00:24:25,507 --> 00:24:27,773
Is there any chance that you,
or your hot friend, hey,

436
00:24:27,774 --> 00:24:31,605
know how to get beer
out of a keg?

437
00:24:31,606 --> 00:24:33,840
No.

438
00:24:33,841 --> 00:24:37,505
- You didn't get a tap?
- I didn't realize they were separate things.

439
00:24:37,506 --> 00:24:40,205
Why would they sell me a barrel
of beer I can't even access?

440
00:24:50,139 --> 00:24:52,539
Garver! What the hell?

441
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:55,606
This is a tame, safe,
parent-friendly party!

442
00:24:55,607 --> 00:24:58,107
Do tame parties
have sundae bars?

443
00:24:59,507 --> 00:25:01,105
I think it's so cool.

444
00:25:01,106 --> 00:25:02,773
No, don't listen to her.

445
00:25:02,774 --> 00:25:04,206
Okay, she's never been
to a party before.

446
00:25:04,207 --> 00:25:06,639
She doesn't understand
how dire the situation is.

447
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,106
- We gotta go.
- What, you're leaving?

448
00:25:08,107 --> 00:25:10,172
No, no, no. I just made
a huge thing of chili.

449
00:25:10,173 --> 00:25:12,405
Garver,
chili is not a party food.

450
00:25:13,673 --> 00:25:16,007
You see, the party's
just kicking off.

451
00:25:20,073 --> 00:25:22,006
What's Charlie Reed doing here?

452
00:25:22,007 --> 00:25:23,206
My God.

453
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,340
Hi.

454
00:25:39,873 --> 00:25:41,207
You look really amazing.

455
00:25:42,939 --> 00:25:45,942
Um... it's all Morgan.

456
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:48,539
No, I don't think so.

457
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:50,706
For you, good sir.

458
00:25:50,707 --> 00:25:52,074
Thank you.

459
00:25:52,973 --> 00:25:54,205
Thank you.

460
00:25:54,206 --> 00:25:55,340
Beef chili?

461
00:25:57,972 --> 00:26:02,473
That's top shelf, buddy.
That's fresh.

462
00:26:02,474 --> 00:26:05,572
You know, I really thought we'd
have a bigger turnout, but...

463
00:26:05,573 --> 00:26:07,539
I told you not to go
up against a cheerleader.

464
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:09,206
What cheerleader?

465
00:26:09,207 --> 00:26:11,505
It's the mean blonde one
with a convertible.

466
00:26:11,506 --> 00:26:12,771
- Zoe Carmichael?
- Yes.

467
00:26:13,674 --> 00:26:15,505
She's having a party
tonight as well.

468
00:26:15,506 --> 00:26:17,605
Must have dinged our turnout.

469
00:26:17,606 --> 00:26:18,838
Do you guys wanna go there?

470
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:21,038
Well, I like the idea.

471
00:26:22,573 --> 00:26:26,640
- Hey.
- I was wondering where you were.

472
00:26:26,641 --> 00:26:28,739
- Who are these people?
- These are my friends.

473
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:31,206
And they brought you a keg.

474
00:26:35,007 --> 00:26:37,639
Great. Come on in.

475
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:53,840
Charlie!

476
00:26:55,807 --> 00:26:57,074
Hey, what's up, man?

477
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:05,174
You good?

478
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:08,972
Hey, I'm gonna
go take a lap upstairs.

479
00:27:08,973 --> 00:27:10,074
Away from you two.

480
00:27:12,973 --> 00:27:14,071
Thank you.

481
00:27:14,072 --> 00:27:16,206
Your friend Morgan,
she seems cool.

482
00:27:17,207 --> 00:27:18,871
Yeah. She's really cool.

483
00:27:19,973 --> 00:27:21,806
How long have you guys
known each other?

484
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:23,740
I don't know. Like, forever.

485
00:27:25,972 --> 00:27:27,805
He's back.

486
00:27:27,806 --> 00:27:29,439
Charlie!

487
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,138
Who is this?

488
00:27:32,139 --> 00:27:36,139
Owen, Wes, this is Katie Price.

489
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:37,439
- Hey.
- Hi.

490
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,439
Katie, you're... you're...

491
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,673
- Um...-
- You got Charlie to come to a party,

492
00:27:42,674 --> 00:27:44,605
and make a smile-like feature.

493
00:27:44,606 --> 00:27:47,573
Our boy hasn't looked
this good in a long time.

494
00:27:47,574 --> 00:27:49,073
There you are.

495
00:27:51,873 --> 00:27:53,673
I'm still thirsty.

496
00:27:53,674 --> 00:27:55,105
Wanna get me that drink now?

497
00:27:55,106 --> 00:27:59,173
I'm actually about to go take
Katie on the house party tour.

498
00:27:59,174 --> 00:28:00,972
So. You ready?

499
00:28:00,973 --> 00:28:02,506
"Tonight, we are victorious"

500
00:28:02,507 --> 00:28:04,705
- We'll be right back.
- Nice meeting you guys.

501
00:28:04,706 --> 00:28:06,226
- Nice to meet you, Katie.
- Take care.

502
00:28:07,706 --> 00:28:09,173
- I can quench your thirst.
- Shut up.

503
00:28:09,174 --> 00:28:13,738
"Victorious"

504
00:28:18,541 --> 00:28:23,038
"We gotta Turn up the crazy"

505
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:27,606
"Livin' like
A washed up celebrity"

506
00:28:27,607 --> 00:28:32,641
"Shooting fireworks
Like it's the Fourth of July"

507
00:28:34,972 --> 00:28:37,540
"Tonight, we are victorious"

508
00:28:37,541 --> 00:28:39,606
"Champagne pouring over us"

509
00:28:39,607 --> 00:28:41,640
Would you like to dance with me?

510
00:28:41,641 --> 00:28:45,206
Garver, what on earth makes you think
I'd ever want to dance with you?

511
00:28:45,207 --> 00:28:47,238
"Until we feel all right"

512
00:28:49,673 --> 00:28:54,006
"Until we feel all right"

513
00:28:54,007 --> 00:28:55,671
You know, if you tell anyone
about this, I'll kill you.

514
00:28:55,672 --> 00:28:56,940
Totally.

515
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:03,941
Hey, hey!

516
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,704
- Hey.
- Gotta stay hydrated.

517
00:29:06,705 --> 00:29:07,941
Thank you.

518
00:29:09,906 --> 00:29:11,771
This is really interesting.

519
00:29:11,772 --> 00:29:15,240
I don't think
I've ever seen this happen.

520
00:29:16,107 --> 00:29:17,704
Yeah.

521
00:29:17,705 --> 00:29:20,738
Classic high school,
awkward party.

522
00:29:21,706 --> 00:29:23,206
I've only seen it at the movies.

523
00:29:23,207 --> 00:29:25,106
I gotta show you this.
Come on.

524
00:29:25,107 --> 00:29:26,907
- God.
- Come on.

525
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:30,740
Okay, similar
to what's going on over here.

526
00:29:31,605 --> 00:29:33,173
We just kind of hold here.

527
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:37,641
And swing the hips awkwardly.

528
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,472
- Am I doing it?
- Yeah, you're kind of.

529
00:29:41,473 --> 00:29:43,273
And then I would slowly back up.

530
00:29:50,173 --> 00:29:53,705
"Forever young, we are"

531
00:29:53,706 --> 00:29:55,871
"Always falling free"

532
00:29:55,872 --> 00:29:58,440
"If tomorrow never comes"

533
00:29:58,441 --> 00:30:00,839
"We will always be
Forever young"

534
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:04,739
Everybody! This is the best
night of my life! Yeah!

535
00:30:11,173 --> 00:30:12,574
You wanna go someplace else?

536
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,675
Okay.

537
00:30:16,572 --> 00:30:17,872
I-I don't get it.

538
00:30:17,873 --> 00:30:19,671
How could they just
take your scholarship away?

539
00:30:19,672 --> 00:30:22,439
Well, I had to have surgery.

540
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,574
And they didn't think
I could ever swim again.

541
00:30:25,906 --> 00:30:28,639
And no more scholarship
meant no more Berkeley.

542
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,972
- I'm really sorry.
- Yeah.

543
00:30:31,973 --> 00:30:35,039
So, how did you do it?
How did you hurt yourself?

544
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,105
It was just a freak accident.

545
00:30:37,106 --> 00:30:39,106
You know, I fell down
some stairs and...

546
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:42,906
And that's not true.

547
00:30:42,907 --> 00:30:45,205
That's kind of what
I tell everybody.

548
00:30:45,206 --> 00:30:47,273
I got really drunk one night
at Owen's house.

549
00:30:49,739 --> 00:30:53,640
And my friends dared me to jump
off the roof into the pool...

550
00:30:54,873 --> 00:30:56,807
and I clipped the edge
with my shoulder.

551
00:30:59,973 --> 00:31:01,206
I'm such an idiot.

552
00:31:01,207 --> 00:31:03,074
I don't wanna be that guy,
you know?

553
00:31:06,972 --> 00:31:08,239
Then don't be.

554
00:31:10,474 --> 00:31:12,871
You know, my mom used to take me
here when I was little.

555
00:31:12,872 --> 00:31:17,872
- Really?
- She sat me right there.

556
00:31:17,873 --> 00:31:21,938
And, um, she tried to teach me
how to play the guitar.

557
00:31:21,939 --> 00:31:25,572
Actually, this watch was hers.

558
00:31:25,573 --> 00:31:29,504
I spent so much time looking
at this thing on her hand.

559
00:31:29,505 --> 00:31:31,073
And...

560
00:31:33,673 --> 00:31:37,971
um, she died when I was little.

561
00:31:37,972 --> 00:31:41,173
- She was in a car accident.
- I'm-I'm so sorry.

562
00:31:41,174 --> 00:31:42,704
- You know, we can go someplace...
- No.

563
00:31:42,705 --> 00:31:45,772
No, no. No, no.
No, I'm... I'm good.

564
00:31:45,773 --> 00:31:48,575
- You sure?
- Yeah, yeah. I promise.

565
00:31:51,072 --> 00:31:52,673
You wanna see something cool?

566
00:31:54,839 --> 00:31:56,471
Ta-da!

567
00:31:56,472 --> 00:31:59,106
- This is yours?
- No.

568
00:31:59,107 --> 00:32:02,006
But it's something I'm taking
care of for the summer.

569
00:32:02,007 --> 00:32:04,139
It's a Jespersen 53.

570
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,905
One of these days we could take
her for a sail around the harbor,

571
00:32:12,906 --> 00:32:14,074
we can watch the sun set.

572
00:32:23,739 --> 00:32:27,006
That sounds perfect.

573
00:32:49,906 --> 00:32:52,771
Um, just, let me get out of...

574
00:32:56,107 --> 00:32:57,341
Sorry.

575
00:32:59,174 --> 00:33:01,038
So, what are
you gonna do this year,

576
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:02,671
now that you're
not going to Berkeley?

577
00:33:02,672 --> 00:33:05,904
Well, first I'm gonna
get a new truck.

578
00:33:07,673 --> 00:33:10,341
And then I'm gonna
drive across the country.

579
00:33:11,873 --> 00:33:13,906
You know, I've been in
the pool my entire life,

580
00:33:13,907 --> 00:33:16,074
and, I haven't
got to see much else, so...

581
00:33:17,673 --> 00:33:21,872
- Um, what are you gonna do...
- I'm not doing anything.

582
00:33:21,873 --> 00:33:25,906
I'm just gonna take some
online courses, I think.

583
00:33:25,907 --> 00:33:29,838
But I'll just be here.

584
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:31,806
I, I meant
what are you doing tomorrow?

585
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:35,571
God.

586
00:33:35,572 --> 00:33:39,340
Um... I...

587
00:33:41,506 --> 00:33:44,072
I'm busy during the day,

588
00:33:44,073 --> 00:33:46,806
but I can be free
tomorrow night.

589
00:33:46,807 --> 00:33:48,107
That's perfect.

590
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:52,207
- I'll see you tomorrow night?
- Okay.

591
00:33:58,906 --> 00:34:00,673
I have something to tell you.

592
00:34:02,739 --> 00:34:04,839
I don't actually have a cat.

593
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,071
No shit.

594
00:34:17,906 --> 00:34:21,472
- Who are you texting?
- No one.

595
00:34:21,473 --> 00:34:22,971
"What if I..."

596
00:34:22,972 --> 00:34:27,471
- Morgan, who are you texting?
- Garver.

597
00:34:28,839 --> 00:34:31,438
Um, I can't hear you
when you're whispering...

598
00:34:31,439 --> 00:34:32,838
Garver!
I made out with Garver.

599
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:36,839
No! He's really, really cute.

600
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:39,905
And he totally likes you.

601
00:34:39,906 --> 00:34:44,505
By the way, can I tell my dad that
I'm going over to yours tonight,

602
00:34:44,506 --> 00:34:46,207
so I can go hang out
with Charlie later?

603
00:34:48,206 --> 00:34:50,105
You're asking me to help you
lie to your father,

604
00:34:50,106 --> 00:34:51,346
so you can hang out with a guy?

605
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:54,807
I've never been so proud of you!

606
00:34:57,439 --> 00:34:59,539
Dad, I'm gonna
go over to Morgan's tonight.

607
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:01,738
- Is that okay?
- Yeah, yeah, no problem.

608
00:35:01,739 --> 00:35:03,074
Hey, how was that party?

609
00:35:05,972 --> 00:35:07,605
Party was nice.

610
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:09,139
Did you meet any fun people?

611
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:11,605
No. Not really.

612
00:35:11,606 --> 00:35:14,571
Everybody was kind of just,
like, you know?

613
00:35:14,572 --> 00:35:16,739
Nobody was really there.
It was just...

614
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:19,172
- So I'm gonna...
- skedaddle.

615
00:35:19,173 --> 00:35:21,639
- Love you.
- Love you more.

616
00:35:26,439 --> 00:35:27,705
I'm lying.

617
00:35:27,706 --> 00:35:30,573
Well, you were rambling,
so I kind of figured.

618
00:35:37,973 --> 00:35:40,739
I'm going to go meet a boy
named Charlie Reed,

619
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:42,938
who's really nice and sweet.

620
00:35:42,939 --> 00:35:47,340
And I really, really
like him... a lot.

621
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,639
- Are you mad?
- I'm not happy that you lied to me.

622
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,639
You know you can
always tell me anything...

623
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,074
I know, I know. I'm sorry.

624
00:35:56,505 --> 00:35:58,139
- Do you trust this guy?
- Yes.

625
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:01,074
- Will I hate him?
- No. No, you won't. I promise.

626
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,138
- Does he know about your...
- I haven't told him yet.

627
00:36:04,139 --> 00:36:05,538
- No, Katie...
- But I will...

628
00:36:05,539 --> 00:36:07,605
No, I am not comfortable
with him not knowing.

629
00:36:07,606 --> 00:36:12,205
I know, I'm going to. I just
need a little bit longer of...

630
00:36:12,206 --> 00:36:16,073
- What?
- Being someone more than just a disease.

631
00:36:18,174 --> 00:36:21,705
- Katie.
- It's just a few more days, please?

632
00:36:21,706 --> 00:36:23,574
Like a normal girl.

633
00:36:24,806 --> 00:36:27,505
Hey.

634
00:36:27,506 --> 00:36:30,439
Is it okay if me and Katie hang out
tonight together, the entire night?

635
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,905
I already admitted everything.

636
00:36:31,906 --> 00:36:34,072
What, you couldn't
make it two hours?

637
00:36:34,073 --> 00:36:37,107
It's pathetic.
I could've made it two hours.

638
00:36:43,539 --> 00:36:45,605
What does Katie Price wanna do?

639
00:36:45,606 --> 00:36:47,938
There are so
many things I wanna do.

640
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:50,772
I have always wanted to do this.

641
00:36:50,773 --> 00:36:56,107
"Just blind and drunk
We can never see what's real"

642
00:36:57,106 --> 00:36:59,340
"See what's real"

643
00:37:01,606 --> 00:37:03,538
Ready?

644
00:37:04,739 --> 00:37:06,405
"All kinds of places"

645
00:37:06,406 --> 00:37:11,274
"Take me away
So I can find what's real"

646
00:37:12,073 --> 00:37:15,337
"Find what's real"

647
00:37:16,905 --> 00:37:18,873
"Home"

648
00:37:23,338 --> 00:37:25,871
"Home"

649
00:37:25,872 --> 00:37:31,406
"And in the morning I will go"

650
00:37:34,073 --> 00:37:35,937
"I've been stuck
With the same kind of people"

651
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:42,539
"Just blind and drunk
We can never see what's real"

652
00:37:43,706 --> 00:37:46,273
"What is real"

653
00:37:51,206 --> 00:37:53,273
What about that one over there?

654
00:37:54,107 --> 00:37:56,238
Um, that one's called Altair.

655
00:37:56,239 --> 00:37:58,704
And it's 16 light years away,

656
00:37:58,705 --> 00:38:00,872
which means the light
we're seeing now,

657
00:38:00,873 --> 00:38:02,540
was actually created
when we were two.

658
00:38:06,338 --> 00:38:07,441
Are you okay?

659
00:38:11,173 --> 00:38:13,407
The Berkeley coach called
my house the other night.

660
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:16,039
Really?

661
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,738
Yeah, I mean, I guess
one of the other swimmers

662
00:38:18,739 --> 00:38:22,774
transferred out
and another spot opened up.

663
00:38:25,305 --> 00:38:27,639
That's so crazy.
You could get your spot back?

664
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:30,173
I mean, technically, yeah.

665
00:38:31,406 --> 00:38:33,172
There's this huge meet
coming up next month,

666
00:38:33,173 --> 00:38:36,405
and the Berkeley coach
is coming down to watch.

667
00:38:36,406 --> 00:38:39,171
But I'd have to get in shape by
then, which is probably impossible.

668
00:38:39,172 --> 00:38:40,383
And then I'd have
to swim, like,

669
00:38:40,408 --> 00:38:42,271
my best time ever to show
that I'm fully rehabbed...

670
00:38:42,272 --> 00:38:44,141
You can totally do it.

671
00:38:51,705 --> 00:38:54,406
There's also some reasons
to stick around here next year.

672
00:38:59,172 --> 00:39:01,540
Katie, I wanna take you
on a real date tomorrow.

673
00:39:03,072 --> 00:39:04,273
Okay.

674
00:39:06,373 --> 00:39:10,006
And you also need
to meet my dad.

675
00:39:17,305 --> 00:39:19,171
Why don't you move
a little closer there, Cody?

676
00:39:19,172 --> 00:39:20,805
My-My name's Charlie.

677
00:39:20,806 --> 00:39:21,938
- Charlie.
- Yeah.

678
00:39:21,939 --> 00:39:23,873
I didn't know that.

679
00:39:25,973 --> 00:39:30,270
Is that what you go by? You go by Charlie
and not Chuck or Chuckie or C-Town?

680
00:39:30,271 --> 00:39:33,405
- No, sir, I... just Charlie.
- Charlie, okay.

681
00:39:34,939 --> 00:39:36,838
- You ever been arrested?
- No, sir.

682
00:39:36,839 --> 00:39:38,338
- When's your curfew?
- It's 1:00 a.m.

683
00:39:38,339 --> 00:39:41,337
- What time do you actually get home?
- Like, 2:00.

684
00:39:41,338 --> 00:39:42,971
That's not one 1:00,
is it, Charlie?

685
00:39:42,972 --> 00:39:44,738
- No, sir, it's not.
- You said your curfew was 1:00.

686
00:39:44,739 --> 00:39:46,638
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

687
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:48,540
Relax, I'm not a cop.

688
00:39:52,072 --> 00:39:53,772
How many times
a week do you shave?

689
00:39:53,773 --> 00:39:59,106
Shave, like four...
four times a week, sir.

690
00:39:59,107 --> 00:40:00,172
- Who's your team?
- Seahawks.

691
00:40:00,173 --> 00:40:01,405
Why?

692
00:40:01,406 --> 00:40:03,038
Well, because they're great.

693
00:40:03,039 --> 00:40:05,305
And one time I was
at this burger place and...

694
00:40:05,306 --> 00:40:07,840
Richard Sherman actually
ate some of my fries.

695
00:40:09,672 --> 00:40:10,940
That's awesome.

696
00:40:11,972 --> 00:40:15,906
Okay. Charlie, here's the deal.

697
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:21,204
Katie appears to be
very strong, and she is.

698
00:40:21,205 --> 00:40:22,939
- Hey.
- She's dealing with...

699
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:24,039
- Hi.
- Hey.

700
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,639
- What you guys talking about?
- Nothing.

701
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:28,204
- We were...
- We're just getting to know each other.

702
00:40:28,205 --> 00:40:29,939
Thank you so much for letting me
take her out, Mr. Price.

703
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:31,039
Okay.

704
00:40:32,106 --> 00:40:33,440
Don't forget your...

705
00:40:34,973 --> 00:40:36,840
guitar case.

706
00:40:37,706 --> 00:40:40,072
Wait, I'll hold it for you.

707
00:40:40,073 --> 00:40:43,774
Hold on a second.
I wanna get a picture of this.

708
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:46,174
Okay.

709
00:40:47,206 --> 00:40:51,872
All right. Just a little.
There you go.

710
00:40:51,873 --> 00:40:53,839
A little room
for the Holy Ghost.

711
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,638
And...

712
00:40:55,639 --> 00:40:58,140
And... open.

713
00:41:01,238 --> 00:41:03,006
I believe these are for you.

714
00:41:03,007 --> 00:41:04,274
Wait.

715
00:41:05,373 --> 00:41:08,106
- Where are we going?
- I know nothing.

716
00:41:08,107 --> 00:41:09,372
Fred.

717
00:41:09,373 --> 00:41:11,774
- Don't even try.
- Thank you, Fred.

718
00:41:15,007 --> 00:41:16,138
Okay, rule number one.

719
00:41:16,139 --> 00:41:17,904
When you're on a train,

720
00:41:17,905 --> 00:41:20,939
you must always travel with
Chinese food out of a backpack.

721
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:24,270
Well, I wouldn't know. I've
never been on a train before.

722
00:41:24,271 --> 00:41:25,671
Neither have I.

723
00:41:25,672 --> 00:41:27,174
- Really?
- Really.

724
00:41:29,739 --> 00:41:30,873
Cheers.

725
00:41:34,339 --> 00:41:37,905
I still cannot believe that we grew up
in the same town since we were younger,

726
00:41:37,906 --> 00:41:39,371
and I've never seen you
out riding your bike,

727
00:41:39,372 --> 00:41:41,137
or out with a lemonade stand.

728
00:41:41,138 --> 00:41:42,638
And I would've
bought your lemonade.

729
00:41:42,639 --> 00:41:45,104
No, you wouldn't have.
I don't like lemonade.

730
00:41:45,105 --> 00:41:46,070
Who doesn't like lemonade?

731
00:41:46,071 --> 00:41:47,774
Me.

732
00:41:48,805 --> 00:41:50,285
You know I know
the real story, right?

733
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:54,905
You and your dad are in
the witness protection program.

734
00:41:54,906 --> 00:41:57,405
And you have both testified
against a mobster.

735
00:41:58,405 --> 00:42:03,439
Very close, but, the truth is...

736
00:42:05,006 --> 00:42:08,304
I've been sent here
to monitor you.

737
00:42:08,305 --> 00:42:11,043
Right, and I've been given
specific instructions

738
00:42:11,068 --> 00:42:12,905
to never be seen
in the daylight,

739
00:42:12,906 --> 00:42:17,639
and I've been watching you this whole
entire time from the safety of my own room.

740
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:21,070
Classic witness protection
program cover story.

741
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,141
All right, close your eyes
and put your hands out.

742
00:42:28,406 --> 00:42:29,774
Okay.

743
00:42:32,772 --> 00:42:34,272
And open.

744
00:42:37,406 --> 00:42:39,540
- Try and catch 'em in your mouth.
- Hey.

745
00:42:42,773 --> 00:42:44,006
Thank you.

746
00:42:44,772 --> 00:42:47,003
And look. We're here.

747
00:42:58,139 --> 00:43:01,874
"Won a moment, lost a bet"

748
00:43:06,138 --> 00:43:09,073
"Saw a mountain, went to bed"

749
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:14,373
Wait, where are you taking me?

750
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:16,805
We're here.

751
00:43:16,806 --> 00:43:19,372
Charlie, what is this place?

752
00:43:19,373 --> 00:43:22,137
- It's your surprise.
- Charlie, my man.

753
00:43:22,138 --> 00:43:24,138
I thought Seattle
was my surprise.

754
00:43:25,271 --> 00:43:26,671
Come on.

755
00:43:26,672 --> 00:43:29,205
Where are we going?

756
00:43:29,206 --> 00:43:33,170
"Even if you think we're not"

757
00:43:33,171 --> 00:43:37,269
"We're close to close enough"

758
00:43:38,238 --> 00:43:41,037
- It's your first live show.
- Yeah.

759
00:43:41,038 --> 00:43:47,038
"We're moving
From the ground floor"

760
00:43:47,039 --> 00:43:50,037
"Rising tide"

761
00:43:50,038 --> 00:43:53,905
"As the water's pouring in"

762
00:43:53,906 --> 00:43:57,738
"Like it always
Should have been"

763
00:43:57,739 --> 00:44:01,839
"We can crawl or we can run"

764
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:05,871
"Towards the sun"

765
00:44:07,139 --> 00:44:08,439
Whoo!

766
00:44:09,039 --> 00:44:10,205
So cool.

767
00:44:10,206 --> 00:44:12,037
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

768
00:44:12,038 --> 00:44:14,305
That was seriously so cool.

769
00:44:14,306 --> 00:44:16,237
I know.

770
00:44:16,238 --> 00:44:19,772
That was, I mean, literally
one of the best things ever.

771
00:44:19,773 --> 00:44:22,338
- Right?
- God.

772
00:44:22,339 --> 00:44:25,173
Live music is beautiful.

773
00:44:25,905 --> 00:44:27,639
You're beautiful.

774
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:29,040
You're the best.

775
00:44:31,805 --> 00:44:34,105
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

776
00:44:36,039 --> 00:44:39,070
Okay. Your turn.

777
00:44:40,305 --> 00:44:41,873
For what?

778
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:47,304
No, no, no, no, no...

779
00:44:47,305 --> 00:44:49,940
- Yes, yes, yes, yes...
- I am not...

780
00:44:50,971 --> 00:44:55,338
- You owe me a song.
- I can't do it... here.

781
00:44:55,339 --> 00:44:56,871
Yes, you can.

782
00:44:56,872 --> 00:44:58,903
Remember?
Live shows are the best.

783
00:44:58,904 --> 00:45:01,071
Are you hungry?
'Cause I'm hungry.

784
00:45:01,072 --> 00:45:02,838
And you're always hungry.

785
00:45:02,839 --> 00:45:08,871
Look, we can either have come
all the way to this new city,

786
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:12,007
underneath the stars
and you don't play me a song...

787
00:45:13,672 --> 00:45:16,773
or we can continue to have
the greatest night of our lives.

788
00:45:22,105 --> 00:45:24,173
I'll be right here watching.

789
00:45:30,172 --> 00:45:32,473
Go. Come on, we're waiting.

790
00:45:37,706 --> 00:45:39,270
"I put my hair up"

791
00:45:39,271 --> 00:45:42,771
"I slap my lipstick on"

792
00:45:42,772 --> 00:45:45,105
"I can't decide What to wear"

793
00:45:45,106 --> 00:45:47,170
"I try my clothes on"

794
00:45:47,171 --> 00:45:50,071
"About a hundred times"

795
00:45:50,072 --> 00:45:52,638
"I wanna get it right"

796
00:45:52,639 --> 00:45:56,639
"But as long as I've got
This perfect feeling"

797
00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:00,037
"I know that everything
Will be right"

798
00:46:00,038 --> 00:46:03,970
"As long as I've got
This sweetest feeling"

799
00:46:03,971 --> 00:46:06,037
"My troubles will be
Out of my sight"

800
00:46:06,038 --> 00:46:09,104
"La da da da Da da da da"

801
00:46:09,105 --> 00:46:11,204
"Da da da da"

802
00:46:11,205 --> 00:46:13,906
"My troubles will be Miles away"

803
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:17,305
"I slip my shoes on"

804
00:46:17,306 --> 00:46:19,739
"Take a spin or two"

805
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:21,838
"Tell me
How does this look to you?"

806
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:23,404
"In the mirror"

807
00:46:23,405 --> 00:46:25,337
"I blow a kiss in school"

808
00:46:25,338 --> 00:46:27,639
"'Cause I'm"

809
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:29,304
"Running late for you"

810
00:46:29,305 --> 00:46:33,771
"But as long as I've got
This perfect feeling"

811
00:46:33,772 --> 00:46:37,305
"I know that everything
Will be right"

812
00:46:37,306 --> 00:46:41,105
"As long as I've got
This sweetest feeling"

813
00:46:41,106 --> 00:46:44,104
"My troubles will be
Out of my sight"

814
00:46:44,105 --> 00:46:46,238
"La da da da Da da da da"

815
00:46:46,239 --> 00:46:48,672
"Da da da da"

816
00:46:48,673 --> 00:46:51,004
"My troubles will be Miles away"

817
00:46:51,005 --> 00:46:52,206
She's good.

818
00:46:53,105 --> 00:46:54,903
"When you take me"

819
00:46:54,904 --> 00:46:57,638
"All around this town"

820
00:46:57,639 --> 00:46:59,937
- Whoo!
- " All the wonder we've seen"

821
00:46:59,938 --> 00:47:03,770
"As long as I've got This perfect feeling"

822
00:47:03,771 --> 00:47:07,204
"I know that everything
Will be right"

823
00:47:07,205 --> 00:47:10,870
"As long as I've got
This sweetest feeling"

824
00:47:10,871 --> 00:47:14,038
"My troubles will be
Out of my sight"

825
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:16,405
"La da da da Da da da da"

826
00:47:16,406 --> 00:47:18,405
"Da da da da"

827
00:47:18,406 --> 00:47:22,136
"My troubles will be Miles away"

828
00:47:36,838 --> 00:47:39,170
Okay, I probably would have
said you were good no matter what,

829
00:47:39,171 --> 00:47:42,871
but you were really,
really good.

830
00:47:42,872 --> 00:47:45,405
You know, you have to do
something with your music.

831
00:47:45,406 --> 00:47:48,139
- No, I couldn't.
- You have to, Katie. It was amazing.

832
00:47:51,005 --> 00:47:52,803
Are you ready?

833
00:47:52,804 --> 00:47:54,738
For what?

834
00:47:54,739 --> 00:47:56,305
To go swimming.

835
00:47:57,705 --> 00:48:00,004
No, Katie, you know
I don't swim anymore.

836
00:48:00,005 --> 00:48:03,105
Yes, you do. You just
haven't swam in a while.

837
00:48:03,106 --> 00:48:05,870
And I've never swam
in this water before,

838
00:48:05,871 --> 00:48:08,404
so you're gonna take me.

839
00:48:11,139 --> 00:48:13,270
- Come on!
- No, I'm serious. I'm not swimming.

840
00:48:13,271 --> 00:48:15,404
But you made me sing
and I didn't want to.

841
00:48:15,405 --> 00:48:17,304
- That was totally different.
- No, it's not!

842
00:48:17,305 --> 00:48:20,839
Okay, do you have any idea
how cold that water is?

843
00:48:21,704 --> 00:48:23,206
Charlie.

844
00:48:24,939 --> 00:48:28,005
We could've either come
all the way to the beach

845
00:48:28,006 --> 00:48:31,171
under the beautiful stars
and not go swimming,

846
00:48:31,172 --> 00:48:35,038
or we could jump into that water

847
00:48:35,039 --> 00:48:37,903
and continue to make this
the best night of our lives.

848
00:48:37,904 --> 00:48:40,539
- I don't have a swimsuit.
- Neither do I.

849
00:48:45,838 --> 00:48:47,272
Katie.

850
00:48:49,738 --> 00:48:50,738
You coming?

851
00:48:57,639 --> 00:48:58,906
Hurry up!

852
00:49:01,305 --> 00:49:03,139
My God. It's so cold.

853
00:49:07,072 --> 00:49:10,273
Put your arms forward
and then push.

854
00:49:12,406 --> 00:49:15,540
The breast stroke? It seems like a trick.

855
00:49:19,106 --> 00:49:21,338
Kinda.

856
00:49:21,339 --> 00:49:25,373
See, this isn't so bad.
You don't hate the water.

857
00:49:28,904 --> 00:49:30,838
I don't hate anything
when I'm with you.

858
00:49:50,006 --> 00:49:52,406
Have you thought any
more about your Berkeley spot?

859
00:49:54,138 --> 00:49:55,872
No.

860
00:50:00,172 --> 00:50:03,338
You know, I just keep thinking
about after the surgery,

861
00:50:03,339 --> 00:50:05,272
when I couldn't swim.

862
00:50:09,139 --> 00:50:12,106
You know, I just realized
I didn't even know who I was.

863
00:50:13,639 --> 00:50:15,473
And neither did anybody else.

864
00:50:18,405 --> 00:50:22,704
All these kids that I've been going
to school with for 15 years, they...

865
00:50:22,705 --> 00:50:24,939
they just saw me
as that guy in the pool.

866
00:50:29,106 --> 00:50:31,540
I don't have to live
that life anymore.

867
00:50:32,339 --> 00:50:33,872
You know...

868
00:50:34,939 --> 00:50:37,006
you're not the guy in the pool.

869
00:50:38,271 --> 00:50:43,106
But you're not the guy
that doesn't try either.

870
00:50:49,904 --> 00:50:54,140
Do everything you can
right now and then decide.

871
00:50:55,739 --> 00:50:57,939
'Cause now is all that matters.

872
00:51:03,306 --> 00:51:05,037
You're right.

873
00:51:05,038 --> 00:51:06,872
Okay.

874
00:51:11,206 --> 00:51:13,105
Speaking of tomorrow morning,

875
00:51:13,106 --> 00:51:15,405
ready for the greatest sunrise
on the planet?

876
00:51:19,639 --> 00:51:21,272
What?

877
00:51:23,373 --> 00:51:25,140
Charlie, what time is it?

878
00:51:29,171 --> 00:51:30,472
It's 4:50.

879
00:51:33,071 --> 00:51:35,139
It's not waterproof.

880
00:51:40,039 --> 00:51:41,737
- My God.
- What?

881
00:51:41,738 --> 00:51:43,305
- My God! My God!
- Katie, wait!

882
00:51:43,306 --> 00:51:44,405
- Shit.
- What are you doing?

883
00:51:44,406 --> 00:51:46,273
- I need to go!
- Katie, wait! Katie!

884
00:51:50,704 --> 00:51:52,372
Katie!

885
00:51:56,338 --> 00:51:58,205
Shit.

886
00:52:06,671 --> 00:52:08,039
Hey, get in. Let me drive you.

887
00:52:10,139 --> 00:52:13,304
Go, Charlie, go!

888
00:52:13,305 --> 00:52:14,871
Katie!

889
00:52:14,872 --> 00:52:16,903
- What the hell is going on?
- You don't understand.

890
00:52:16,904 --> 00:52:19,305
- You have to go as fast as you can!
- Okay, I'm going. I'm going.

891
00:52:19,306 --> 00:52:22,105
- Katie, what...
- Please just go, Charlie.

892
00:52:22,106 --> 00:52:23,771
- You're scaring me.
- You have to speed! Faster!

893
00:52:23,772 --> 00:52:24,873
Okay, okay!

894
00:52:27,804 --> 00:52:29,005
My God.

895
00:52:29,772 --> 00:52:31,872
Katie!

896
00:52:32,405 --> 00:52:34,038
Katie!

897
00:52:36,106 --> 00:52:38,839
Katie!

898
00:52:41,105 --> 00:52:43,172
Katie. Katie!

899
00:52:44,205 --> 00:52:46,804
Katie.

900
00:52:48,738 --> 00:52:50,836
Katie, will you please
just talk to me?

901
00:52:53,305 --> 00:52:55,372
- Katie, please, just talk to me!
- Hey!

902
00:52:55,373 --> 00:52:57,737
- Is she inside?
- Yes.

903
00:52:57,738 --> 00:52:59,405
Is she in there? Move!
Just move!

904
00:53:00,972 --> 00:53:03,138
- How could you let this happen to her?
- Let what happen?

905
00:53:03,139 --> 00:53:04,937
What happened?

906
00:53:04,938 --> 00:53:07,270
She not... tell you?

907
00:53:07,271 --> 00:53:09,509
Tell me what? I have
no idea what's going on!

908
00:53:09,534 --> 00:53:10,871
She's sick. She's sick.

909
00:53:10,872 --> 00:53:13,638
- What do you mean she's sick?
- She has XP.

910
00:53:13,639 --> 00:53:16,738
She can't go in the sun at all.
It can kill her. I'm sorry.

911
00:53:16,739 --> 00:53:19,406
Katie?

912
00:53:40,639 --> 00:53:43,970
This is a nice hospital.

913
00:53:43,971 --> 00:53:46,173
I bet they have
really good food.

914
00:53:48,638 --> 00:53:50,272
Katie Price?

915
00:53:51,205 --> 00:53:52,540
We're ready.

916
00:54:09,972 --> 00:54:12,273
It was like a second, if that.

917
00:54:13,239 --> 00:54:15,104
Okay?
Everything's gonna be fine.

918
00:54:15,105 --> 00:54:16,538
We're good, Mr. P.

919
00:54:20,972 --> 00:54:22,737
Hey.

920
00:54:22,738 --> 00:54:24,272
Is she okay?

921
00:54:42,771 --> 00:54:45,137
Okay, Katie, you can sit up. Nurse
Jane will take you back outside.

922
00:54:45,138 --> 00:54:48,439
Um, actually, I wanna stay.

923
00:54:50,739 --> 00:54:54,703
Okay. The sunlight exposure
was minimal.

924
00:54:54,704 --> 00:54:58,005
The physical effects you're
seeing right now will heal.

925
00:54:58,006 --> 00:55:02,737
But, as you know, XP generally lies
dormant until there's a triggering event.

926
00:55:02,738 --> 00:55:04,637
We won't know if
that's what this was

927
00:55:04,638 --> 00:55:07,206
until we get the results back from
your blood work and CT scans.

928
00:55:08,705 --> 00:55:10,738
And if this was
a triggering event?

929
00:55:10,739 --> 00:55:13,771
We'll cross that bridge if we come to it.

930
00:55:13,772 --> 00:55:15,903
If you experience
any symptoms...

931
00:55:15,904 --> 00:55:19,738
unexpected shaking, muscular
pain, loss of motor function,

932
00:55:19,739 --> 00:55:21,704
you need to let us know
immediately.

933
00:55:21,705 --> 00:55:24,439
Okay. I'm gonna go
get dressed now.

934
00:55:26,705 --> 00:55:30,237
I'm pretty busy during the day,
but I could be free at night.

935
00:55:32,006 --> 00:55:34,370
I can be free at night.

936
00:55:34,371 --> 00:55:36,305
My dad's super protective.

937
00:55:38,771 --> 00:55:40,737
What about UW?

938
00:55:40,738 --> 00:55:42,804
What about the study? Have
they started the second phase?

939
00:55:42,805 --> 00:55:45,538
I followed up with them
last week. No news yet.

940
00:55:47,771 --> 00:55:50,005
Okay. Thanks.

941
00:55:59,404 --> 00:56:01,539
All right, Charlie.
Let's get back to work.

942
00:56:21,004 --> 00:56:22,811
Look, I know I told you
to play hard to get

943
00:56:22,836 --> 00:56:24,762
but you should at least
see what he has to say.

944
00:56:31,537 --> 00:56:33,763
He's asking if he can
come over and talk to you.

945
00:56:33,788 --> 00:56:34,529
Don't.

946
00:56:35,971 --> 00:56:37,470
Please just delete them.

947
00:56:37,471 --> 00:56:39,204
Katie.

948
00:56:39,205 --> 00:56:42,604
Look, if I read them,
then I'm gonna reply,

949
00:56:42,605 --> 00:56:46,870
then he's gonna reply
and then we're gonna meet up.

950
00:56:46,871 --> 00:56:48,470
Which we can't.

951
00:56:48,471 --> 00:56:50,271
Why can't you? I...

952
00:56:50,272 --> 00:56:52,571
You don't have to be a martyr just
to protect Charlie's feelings.

953
00:56:52,572 --> 00:56:54,536
He's a big boy.
I'm sure he can handle it.

954
00:56:54,537 --> 00:56:57,571
I can't handle it.
Okay?

955
00:57:00,105 --> 00:57:03,171
He's gonna get hurt, and I'm not
gonna be the one who hurts him.

956
00:57:03,172 --> 00:57:05,239
So, please, can you
just delete them?

957
00:57:09,972 --> 00:57:12,072
Yeah. Okay.

958
00:57:57,071 --> 00:57:59,370
We should do
another set of tests.

959
00:57:59,371 --> 00:58:01,571
The results could
come back different.

960
00:58:01,572 --> 00:58:04,138
Her brain has begun to contract.

961
00:58:04,139 --> 00:58:06,403
- Once the neural pathways...
- What about the study?

962
00:58:06,404 --> 00:58:09,336
They shut it down, Jack.

963
00:58:09,337 --> 00:58:12,638
I found out this morning.
There's no funding.

964
00:58:26,505 --> 00:58:28,370
No, I...

965
00:58:28,371 --> 00:58:31,072
I did everything
I was supposed to do.

966
00:58:35,039 --> 00:58:37,973
I mean, from the time
she was very young...

967
00:58:39,239 --> 00:58:41,106
no matter how much she...

968
00:58:42,505 --> 00:58:44,239
cried...

969
00:58:45,072 --> 00:58:47,406
or screamed or moaned...

970
00:58:48,238 --> 00:58:49,671
I wouldn't let her go outside.

971
00:58:55,471 --> 00:58:58,038
I wouldn't let her
go to the park.

972
00:58:59,205 --> 00:59:02,470
I wouldn't even let her
go to the beach.

973
00:59:02,471 --> 00:59:04,937
And she begged me.

974
00:59:04,938 --> 00:59:06,671
She begged me...

975
00:59:09,938 --> 00:59:12,237
for things that
she had every right to.

976
00:59:12,238 --> 00:59:14,672
And I denied her all of it.

977
00:59:15,572 --> 00:59:18,236
I mean, for what?

978
00:59:18,237 --> 00:59:21,073
For this? No.

979
00:59:36,305 --> 00:59:40,838
XP is a disease that tends to
take the joy from a child's life.

980
00:59:40,839 --> 00:59:42,403
In all these years
I've treated Katie,

981
00:59:42,404 --> 00:59:45,369
she's never complained,
she's never sulked.

982
00:59:45,370 --> 00:59:47,639
She always sees
the good in things.

983
00:59:50,271 --> 00:59:52,971
And the way she talks about you?

984
00:59:52,972 --> 00:59:56,604
I've never seen a teenager
so openly adore her father.

985
01:00:00,138 --> 01:00:02,373
You're a good father, Jack.

986
01:00:06,004 --> 01:00:07,405
How long?

987
01:00:08,504 --> 01:00:10,305
It's hard to say for sure.

988
01:01:32,839 --> 01:01:35,003
- Hey, kiddo.
- Hey, Dad.

989
01:01:35,004 --> 01:01:38,038
I'm starving.
Wanna get some Chinese?

990
01:01:38,039 --> 01:01:40,937
- "Yuh."
- Is that a yeah?

991
01:01:40,938 --> 01:01:42,604
What are you doing?

992
01:01:43,839 --> 01:01:46,304
I'm starting you
an online dating profile.

993
01:01:47,204 --> 01:01:49,072
- What?
- Yeah.

994
01:01:50,205 --> 01:01:53,103
Look, okay.
So, I have this photo of you,

995
01:01:53,104 --> 01:01:54,937
which I think your hair
looks better in.

996
01:01:54,938 --> 01:01:57,143
But then in this one
you have your camera.

997
01:01:57,168 --> 01:01:58,169
No, no, no, no.

998
01:01:58,170 --> 01:02:01,038
- This is not happening.
- No, no, no. This is happening.

999
01:02:01,039 --> 01:02:02,938
Here, just take a seat.
Wanna help me write it?

1000
01:02:02,939 --> 01:02:05,370
I don't know.

1001
01:02:05,371 --> 01:02:08,570
Okay, here's what I have so far.

1002
01:02:08,571 --> 01:02:11,945
"World's greatest father and
handsomest photographer."

1003
01:02:11,970 --> 01:02:13,069
Veto.

1004
01:02:13,070 --> 01:02:15,270
"Looking for a fellow adventurer

1005
01:02:15,271 --> 01:02:20,203
interested in art, photography and
nostalgia about the Supersonics."

1006
01:02:20,204 --> 01:02:23,403
- Supersonics is good. That's important.
- I knew you would like that.

1007
01:02:23,404 --> 01:02:26,150
Um, "a partner in crime
to travel the world with."

1008
01:02:26,175 --> 01:02:27,628
I don't travel, honey.

1009
01:02:28,872 --> 01:02:31,206
You will though.

1010
01:02:35,305 --> 01:02:37,004
All right, we're not doing this.

1011
01:02:37,005 --> 01:02:39,973
Please, please, please,
I want to.

1012
01:02:43,205 --> 01:02:45,372
You lost Mom and now
you're gonna lose me too.

1013
01:02:54,103 --> 01:02:57,103
No. No, there's
always a chance.

1014
01:02:57,104 --> 01:03:00,370
We've always known it's
a matter of when and not if.

1015
01:03:00,371 --> 01:03:05,471
So I really need you
to be selfish and...

1016
01:03:07,003 --> 01:03:10,437
go out there and, you know,
take those beautiful photos

1017
01:03:10,438 --> 01:03:12,370
and start traveling
the world again.

1018
01:03:12,371 --> 01:03:15,336
- I want everyone to see your photos, Dad.
- Just stop.

1019
01:03:15,337 --> 01:03:18,837
Okay, I can't...
I can't...

1020
01:03:18,838 --> 01:03:21,038
I just want you...

1021
01:03:22,537 --> 01:03:25,437
to promise me that you're
gonna take care of yourself.

1022
01:03:25,438 --> 01:03:29,371
I really want you to have as happy
a life as the one you've given me.

1023
01:03:30,304 --> 01:03:32,537
And try and find someone

1024
01:03:32,538 --> 01:03:36,270
that you can share these
incredible adventures with.

1025
01:03:36,271 --> 01:03:39,139
Because having someone...

1026
01:03:42,405 --> 01:03:44,405
that's the best part.

1027
01:03:45,604 --> 01:03:50,571
So please, just pick
a rando lady and take her out.

1028
01:03:55,104 --> 01:03:56,937
Okay.

1029
01:03:56,938 --> 01:03:58,504
Okay.

1030
01:03:59,538 --> 01:04:01,739
- Promise me.
- I promise.

1031
01:04:07,238 --> 01:04:09,073
Good.

1032
01:04:12,304 --> 01:04:15,038
Now we can order Chinese food.

1033
01:04:16,905 --> 01:04:20,103
- Come on!
- That was so a ball.

1034
01:04:20,104 --> 01:04:23,168
That's... That's not even baseball.
I don't know what that is.

1035
01:04:27,370 --> 01:04:32,205
Food. Finally. What took them so long?

1036
01:04:38,271 --> 01:04:41,870
My God.
Charlie's outside.

1037
01:04:41,871 --> 01:04:44,070
I know. I called him.

1038
01:04:44,071 --> 01:04:46,503
What? Why?

1039
01:04:46,504 --> 01:04:48,204
Because...

1040
01:04:50,137 --> 01:04:53,103
you said the best part was having
someone to share your adventures with.

1041
01:04:53,104 --> 01:04:57,838
So, go talk to him.
Tell him the truth.

1042
01:04:57,839 --> 01:05:00,369
He deserves that.

1043
01:05:00,370 --> 01:05:02,304
And so do you.

1044
01:05:09,938 --> 01:05:11,604
You exist.

1045
01:05:13,004 --> 01:05:15,138
This time I was positive
I dreamt you.

1046
01:05:18,305 --> 01:05:20,103
Charlie, I'm so sorry.

1047
01:05:20,104 --> 01:05:23,069
Katie, this isn't something you
can just not tell me.

1048
01:05:23,070 --> 01:05:27,337
I'm so, so sorry
I didn't tell you.

1049
01:05:27,338 --> 01:05:28,739
That's...

1050
01:05:31,903 --> 01:05:36,505
unforgivable and
very selfish on my part.

1051
01:05:39,438 --> 01:05:42,072
We were never gonna work.

1052
01:05:43,305 --> 01:05:45,105
But I wanted us to.

1053
01:05:46,438 --> 01:05:49,138
You, me, we...

1054
01:05:50,470 --> 01:05:53,137
we don't win in the end.

1055
01:05:54,037 --> 01:05:56,137
So...

1056
01:05:56,138 --> 01:05:57,739
So I'm saying good-bye,
Charlie.

1057
01:06:01,003 --> 01:06:02,471
Good-bye.

1058
01:06:09,938 --> 01:06:12,504
You know, that was the worst
break-up speech I've ever heard.

1059
01:06:12,505 --> 01:06:16,070
- What?
- Yeah. Like a D-minus would be generous.

1060
01:06:16,071 --> 01:06:18,469
Zeros from all the judges Katie.
It was a total flop.

1061
01:06:18,470 --> 01:06:21,569
I've never done this before!
What do you expect?

1062
01:06:22,970 --> 01:06:26,571
Seriously, Charlie.
We can't.

1063
01:06:28,438 --> 01:06:30,237
We can.

1064
01:06:38,970 --> 01:06:40,738
What I can't do...

1065
01:06:41,904 --> 01:06:43,937
I can't stop being with you.

1066
01:06:43,938 --> 01:06:47,336
Katie, I've done
my research on XP.

1067
01:06:47,337 --> 01:06:50,103
I know what it is. I know
what you are going through.

1068
01:06:50,104 --> 01:06:52,970
But we're not the couple
who doesn't try.

1069
01:06:52,971 --> 01:06:55,404
You knew that before I did.

1070
01:07:07,038 --> 01:07:09,336
You've changed my life, Katie.

1071
01:07:09,337 --> 01:07:11,738
Okay, you can either just leave
me here on this porch or...

1072
01:07:13,038 --> 01:07:16,204
or we can have the best summer
of our lives.

1073
01:07:18,404 --> 01:07:20,301
What's it gonna be?

1074
01:08:07,870 --> 01:08:09,472
Go, Charlie! Push it!

1075
01:08:12,537 --> 01:08:14,204
Go, Charlie!

1076
01:08:21,070 --> 01:08:22,738
That's it, Charlie! Come on!

1077
01:08:26,038 --> 01:08:28,970
- Charlie, let's go!
- Whoo! Whoo!

1078
01:08:28,971 --> 01:08:33,137
Go, Charlie!
Come on, Charlie! Go! Go!

1079
01:08:38,204 --> 01:08:40,069
- Whoo-hoo!
- Yeah!

1080
01:08:40,070 --> 01:08:42,537
Yeah!

1081
01:08:42,538 --> 01:08:44,471
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

1082
01:08:46,304 --> 01:08:49,870
The Berkeley coach was impressed and
they promised to keep in touch.

1083
01:08:49,871 --> 01:08:53,336
In touch is good. They'll be in touch.
I'm so proud of you, honey.

1084
01:08:53,337 --> 01:08:55,504
So good.

1085
01:08:59,071 --> 01:09:00,570
Hey, I'll be right back.

1086
01:09:00,571 --> 01:09:02,138
Sure.

1087
01:09:04,437 --> 01:09:06,369
- Hey, Charlie.
- Hi.

1088
01:09:06,370 --> 01:09:09,204
- The rumors are true. Congrats.
- Thank you.

1089
01:09:09,205 --> 01:09:12,072
- You were great in there.
- Thank you for letting Katie come.

1090
01:09:12,903 --> 01:09:14,471
I couldn't have stopped her.

1091
01:09:15,371 --> 01:09:17,469
Mr. Price,

1092
01:09:17,470 --> 01:09:19,372
would you mind if I took
Katie out tomorrow?

1093
01:09:22,437 --> 01:09:24,370
Yeah.

1094
01:09:24,371 --> 01:09:26,102
Yeah, I think that'd be fine.

1095
01:09:26,103 --> 01:09:27,471
Thank you.

1096
01:10:06,537 --> 01:10:09,604
- Come on. Come on.
- I'm so confused. What are we...

1097
01:10:18,238 --> 01:10:20,569
- What is this?
- It's for you.

1098
01:10:20,570 --> 01:10:22,870
- Is this Katie?
- Yeah.

1099
01:10:22,871 --> 01:10:25,369
Let's do this.

1100
01:10:25,370 --> 01:10:28,602
- No. My God, no.
- Katie. Katie, yes.

1101
01:10:28,603 --> 01:10:30,337
- No, I can't. I can't.
- Yes, yes, yes. Yes.

1102
01:10:30,338 --> 01:10:32,138
Yes.

1103
01:10:33,904 --> 01:10:37,403
This is so crazy. How... How
did you even pay for this?

1104
01:10:37,404 --> 01:10:40,336
- Don't worry about it.
- Charlie, your truck money?

1105
01:10:40,337 --> 01:10:42,469
- I can't let you...
- Katie, it's already done.

1106
01:10:42,470 --> 01:10:47,738
Okay, you helped me figure out my
dreams and now it's payback time.

1107
01:10:50,737 --> 01:10:52,802
I can't play anymore.

1108
01:10:52,803 --> 01:10:55,172
Then just sing.

1109
01:11:02,605 --> 01:11:04,669
Whenever you're ready, Katie.

1110
01:11:04,670 --> 01:11:07,170
Let's lay one down.

1111
01:11:07,171 --> 01:11:08,805
Thank you.

1112
01:11:11,504 --> 01:11:13,504
How did you get this?

1113
01:11:13,505 --> 01:11:16,504
This is the song I've been working on.

1114
01:11:16,505 --> 01:11:18,937
Stole your notebook again.

1115
01:11:32,504 --> 01:11:34,202
"I wish"

1116
01:11:34,203 --> 01:11:36,036
"I could stand"

1117
01:11:36,037 --> 01:11:37,605
"On a star"

1118
01:11:39,771 --> 01:11:41,537
"I wish"

1119
01:11:41,538 --> 01:11:43,370
"I could be"

1120
01:11:43,371 --> 01:11:45,272
"Where you are"

1121
01:11:47,404 --> 01:11:52,404
"They say don't you
Ever give up"

1122
01:11:54,303 --> 01:11:59,671
"It's so hard to be something
When you're not"

1123
01:12:01,270 --> 01:12:05,336
"But I have walked alone"

1124
01:12:05,337 --> 01:12:09,202
"With the stars
In the moonlit night"

1125
01:12:09,203 --> 01:12:12,637
"I have walked alone"

1126
01:12:12,638 --> 01:12:16,302
"No one by my side"

1127
01:12:16,303 --> 01:12:19,803
"Now I walk with you"

1128
01:12:19,804 --> 01:12:23,504
"With my head held high"

1129
01:12:23,505 --> 01:12:27,369
"In the darkest sky"

1130
01:12:27,370 --> 01:12:31,001
"I feel so alive"

1131
01:12:36,303 --> 01:12:37,772
No.

1132
01:12:38,669 --> 01:12:40,503
Yeah, really good job.

1133
01:12:40,504 --> 01:12:42,671
Let me count our chips.

1134
01:12:50,570 --> 01:12:53,538
- That one.
- That one?

1135
01:12:55,037 --> 01:12:56,703
That's Charlinium,

1136
01:12:56,704 --> 01:13:01,270
because it is huge and powerful.

1137
01:13:01,271 --> 01:13:04,770
And that one is my favorite.

1138
01:13:04,771 --> 01:13:08,103
That one is Burritorium,

1139
01:13:08,104 --> 01:13:10,405
because it's shaped
like a burrito.

1140
01:13:11,437 --> 01:13:13,602
That one is Procyon.

1141
01:13:13,603 --> 01:13:15,837
It's 11 light years away.

1142
01:13:17,104 --> 01:13:20,837
So we were seven
when that light was made.

1143
01:13:23,669 --> 01:13:28,504
That was, um, right around the time
you got your first skateboard.

1144
01:13:31,170 --> 01:13:32,337
What?

1145
01:13:35,603 --> 01:13:38,937
Charlie, that night we met
at the train station...

1146
01:13:40,404 --> 01:13:42,436
I already knew you.

1147
01:13:42,437 --> 01:13:44,504
Wh-What do you mean?

1148
01:13:46,204 --> 01:13:49,236
In elementary school,

1149
01:13:49,237 --> 01:13:53,602
you walked by window every day
on your way to swim practice.

1150
01:13:53,603 --> 01:13:57,069
And in fourth grade,

1151
01:13:57,070 --> 01:13:59,337
you started skateboarding.

1152
01:13:59,338 --> 01:14:05,336
And in sixth grade, you wore a
Ken Griffey Jr. jersey every day

1153
01:14:05,337 --> 01:14:07,937
for, like, a month straight.

1154
01:14:09,238 --> 01:14:12,535
And in ninth grade,

1155
01:14:12,536 --> 01:14:15,237
you buzzed off all your hair.

1156
01:14:16,771 --> 01:14:18,505
And...

1157
01:14:23,203 --> 01:14:25,271
every day...

1158
01:14:27,338 --> 01:14:30,405
I waited for you
to walk by my window...

1159
01:14:33,504 --> 01:14:36,305
and it was the best part
of my day.

1160
01:14:39,170 --> 01:14:41,272
If I had just looked up...

1161
01:14:43,669 --> 01:14:45,870
I could've been with you
this whole time.

1162
01:14:49,370 --> 01:14:50,704
You were.

1163
01:14:58,204 --> 01:14:59,539
I...

1164
01:15:00,704 --> 01:15:02,703
I love you, Charlie.

1165
01:15:06,669 --> 01:15:08,538
I love you too.

1166
01:15:12,303 --> 01:15:15,368
I can't believe you still
like me after that buzz cut.

1167
01:15:16,770 --> 01:15:19,605
It was so ugly.
My God.

1168
01:15:51,103 --> 01:15:53,370
Okay, there's some more chicken,
but I'm eating the rest of the noodles,

1169
01:15:53,371 --> 01:15:55,302
if no one wants them.

1170
01:15:55,303 --> 01:15:58,403
Okay. I'm gonna go to the marina.
I'll be back in an hour.

1171
01:15:58,404 --> 01:16:00,668
Someday I wanna see this
Beyoncé-worthy yacht you're cleaning.

1172
01:16:00,669 --> 01:16:02,503
You're gonna miss your chance.

1173
01:16:02,504 --> 01:16:05,572
Owner's back tomorrow.
It's my last checkup.

1174
01:16:06,604 --> 01:16:08,938
- See you in an hour?
- Okay.

1175
01:16:11,569 --> 01:16:14,369
- I'll walk you out.
- All right. I'll see you.

1176
01:16:14,370 --> 01:16:16,569
One of these days we can

1177
01:16:16,570 --> 01:16:18,604
take her for a sail
around the harbor.

1178
01:16:20,070 --> 01:16:21,937
We can watch the sun set.

1179
01:16:24,371 --> 01:16:25,539
Wait.

1180
01:16:27,038 --> 01:16:29,703
I... I wanna go with him.

1181
01:16:29,704 --> 01:16:31,938
Go where, honey?

1182
01:16:32,737 --> 01:16:34,272
Out.

1183
01:16:35,071 --> 01:16:37,536
Sailing on the boat.

1184
01:16:37,537 --> 01:16:40,604
I wanna go with him
on the boat. Now.

1185
01:16:45,569 --> 01:16:46,803
Honey.

1186
01:16:46,804 --> 01:16:49,671
- It'd be better if you just...
- Please, Dad.

1187
01:16:52,570 --> 01:16:54,405
Let me do this.

1188
01:17:00,070 --> 01:17:02,137
It's okay, Dad.

1189
01:17:02,138 --> 01:17:04,438
I really want to.

1190
01:17:14,469 --> 01:17:16,169
Okay.

1191
01:17:16,170 --> 01:17:21,336
"I have seen A thousand things"

1192
01:17:21,337 --> 01:17:26,269
"A thousand minds
And what they bring"

1193
01:17:26,270 --> 01:17:31,269
"To this world And to this home"

1194
01:17:31,270 --> 01:17:37,436
"But where I stand Well, I"

1195
01:17:37,437 --> 01:17:40,671
"Don't know"

1196
01:17:59,270 --> 01:18:01,671
"I'm an open book"

1197
01:18:03,804 --> 01:18:08,202
"I'll tell you everything
I know"

1198
01:18:08,203 --> 01:18:14,503
"To the darkest corners
Of my mind"

1199
01:18:16,603 --> 01:18:20,803
"My kingdom is wide"

1200
01:18:20,804 --> 01:18:25,335
"So wide-eyed
I can't track the time"

1201
01:18:25,336 --> 01:18:31,803
"Between the spaces Of my mind"

1202
01:18:34,037 --> 01:18:38,602
"'Cause I have seen
A thousand things"

1203
01:18:38,603 --> 01:18:43,202
"A thousand minds
And what they bring"

1204
01:18:43,203 --> 01:18:48,070
I've waited my whole life to feel this.

1205
01:18:48,071 --> 01:18:51,736
"But where I stand
Well, I don't know"

1206
01:18:51,737 --> 01:18:55,769
"And people come And people go"

1207
01:18:55,770 --> 01:19:00,268
"People I will never know"

1208
01:19:00,269 --> 01:19:04,536
"But if I did And if I could"

1209
01:19:04,537 --> 01:19:09,103
"I'd wonder when
And where they stood"

1210
01:19:09,104 --> 01:19:14,069
"'Cause I have seen
A thousand things"

1211
01:19:14,070 --> 01:19:18,702
"A thousand minds
And what they bring"

01:19:23,336 --> 01:19:29,468
"But where I stand Well, I"

1214
01:19:29,469 --> 01:19:31,603
"Don't know"

1215
01:21:18,302 --> 01:21:21,037
There he is.

1216
01:21:21,038 --> 01:21:23,169
Hey, Mr. Price.

1217
01:21:23,170 --> 01:21:25,269
Glad you made it by
before you took off.

1218
01:21:25,270 --> 01:21:27,702
Of course. I'm...
I'm actually leaving today.

1219
01:21:27,703 --> 01:21:29,235
Yeah.

1220
01:21:29,236 --> 01:21:31,469
The first practice is
in a couple of days, so...

1221
01:21:31,470 --> 01:21:33,703
- That's exciting!
- Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.

1222
01:21:33,704 --> 01:21:36,603
Your coach sent me your schedule, so
I'm hoping to make it down for a meet.

1223
01:21:36,604 --> 01:21:39,671
But why would, my coach
send you the schedule?

1224
01:21:41,237 --> 01:21:43,770
We stayed in touch, I guess,
after Katie reached out.

1225
01:21:43,771 --> 01:21:46,503
- Katie reached out.
- Yeah.

1226
01:21:46,504 --> 01:21:50,537
She called him. Told him that he
needed to take another look at you.

1227
01:21:51,504 --> 01:21:53,568
No, Katie never told me.

1228
01:21:53,569 --> 01:21:55,535
You know what? Hold that
thought, all right?

1229
01:21:55,536 --> 01:21:57,570
I got something for you.

1230
01:22:10,337 --> 01:22:11,938
She wanted you to have that.

1231
01:22:25,569 --> 01:22:27,172
I...

1232
01:22:28,604 --> 01:22:31,404
I never said sorry.

1233
01:22:32,404 --> 01:22:36,035
I never apologized to you.

1234
01:22:36,036 --> 01:22:38,469
I should have never kept Katie
out that late and I...

1235
01:22:38,470 --> 01:22:40,171
Stop.

1236
01:22:41,102 --> 01:22:42,670
Stop!

1237
01:22:43,737 --> 01:22:46,538
It's nobody's fault.
Okay?

1238
01:22:49,303 --> 01:22:52,769
We knew from the
time that she was little

1239
01:22:52,770 --> 01:22:54,937
that every day
was gonna be a gift.

1240
01:22:56,503 --> 01:22:58,335
I should be thanking you.

1241
01:23:00,537 --> 01:23:02,938
All I ever wanted to do
was make her happy.

1242
01:23:04,570 --> 01:23:06,671
And you made her so happy.

1243
01:23:08,404 --> 01:23:09,538
Thank you.

1244
01:23:15,670 --> 01:23:18,538
- Good luck at school, son.
- Thank you.

1245
01:23:28,170 --> 01:23:31,168
Coming up next, we have
a song that is blowing up on YouTube

with over two million views
in just two weeks.

Get ready to hear it
all over the airwaves.

Just remember
you heard it here first.

This is "Charlie's Song"
by Katie Price.

1250
01:23:42,704 --> 01:23:44,235
"I wish"

1251
01:23:44,236 --> 01:23:46,068
"I could be"

1252
01:23:46,069 --> 01:23:47,670
"Where you are"

1253
01:23:49,770 --> 01:23:54,803
"They say don't you
Ever give up"

1254
01:23:57,036 --> 01:24:02,270
"It's so hard to be something
When you're not"

1255
01:24:04,036 --> 01:24:08,436
"But I have walked alone"

1256
01:24:08,437 --> 01:24:12,036
"With the stars
In the moonlit night"

1257
01:24:12,037 --> 01:24:15,269
"I have walked alone"

1258
01:24:15,270 --> 01:24:18,770
"No one by my side"

1259
01:24:18,771 --> 01:24:22,503
"Now I walk with you"

1260
01:24:22,504 --> 01:24:26,335
"With my head held high"

1261
01:24:26,336 --> 01:24:30,102
"In the darkest sky"

1262
01:24:30,103 --> 01:24:33,804
"I feel so alive"

1263
01:24:44,770 --> 01:24:47,871
"But you're here On my mind"

1264
01:24:49,637 --> 01:24:54,268
"But I have walked alone"

1265
01:24:54,269 --> 01:24:57,469
"With the stars
In the moonlit night"

1266
01:24:57,470 --> 01:25:01,169
- " I have walked alone"
- Yes!

1267
01:25:01,170 --> 01:25:04,569
- " No one by my side"
- Yes! Hey!

1268
01:25:04,570 --> 01:25:07,669
- Hey, that's my girl! Hey, that's my girl!
- " Now I walk with you"

1269
01:25:07,670 --> 01:25:10,469
Did you hear this? Put down the...
Put it down! Listen! Listen!

1270
01:25:10,470 --> 01:25:12,402
"Head held high"

1271
01:25:12,403 --> 01:25:15,669
"In the darkest sky"

01:25:15,670 --> 01:25:19,504
"I feel so alive"

1273
01:25:20,770 --> 01:25:23,102
Dear, Charlie.

1274
01:25:23,103 --> 01:25:29,035
I've always been more comfortable writing
song lyrics than actual sentences.

1275
01:25:29,036 --> 01:25:31,770
There's no way I can articulate
what you've meant to me.

1276
01:25:31,771 --> 01:25:34,636
Since that moment
we first saw each other,

1277
01:25:34,637 --> 01:25:39,668
or the joy you've brought me since
I first saw you outside my window.

1278
01:25:39,669 --> 01:25:42,436
Even though our time together
was short,

1279
01:25:42,437 --> 01:25:46,135
the stars have been burning
for every moment of it.

1280
01:25:46,136 --> 01:25:49,569
And the light from those moments will be
shining down for the next thousand years.

1281
01:25:49,570 --> 01:25:53,703
"But I have walked alone"

1282
01:25:53,704 --> 01:25:59,368
I hope that somehow I'll be able
to look down and see you, Charlie,

1283
01:25:59,369 --> 01:26:04,036
and all of the incredible moments
just waiting for you out there.

1284
01:26:04,037 --> 01:26:05,602
And if you need me,

1285
01:26:05,603 --> 01:26:08,435
all you have to do is look up.

1286
01:26:08,436 --> 01:26:10,468
And remember...

1287
01:26:10,469 --> 01:26:12,036
I love you.
