1
00:00:28,696 --> 00:00:32,126
[thunder rumbling]

2
00:01:17,211 --> 00:01:19,551
I gotta lock up, son.

3
00:01:21,349 --> 00:01:24,449
You looking for faith, forgiveness?

4
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:32,289
I'm lookin' for the Bulls
to cover the spread.

5
00:01:36,197 --> 00:01:38,367
[chattering, laughing]

6
00:01:44,338 --> 00:01:47,378
Conor, Duffy's here.
You better have his money.

7
00:01:47,408 --> 00:01:51,448
I got it. I'm gonna have it.
What's the score?

8
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:54,249
You're into Duffy for at least five grand.
Who gave you an account?

9
00:01:54,282 --> 00:01:56,682
I laid six grand
with the Barber to get me even.

10
00:01:56,717 --> 00:01:58,747
Chicago's down by four.

11
00:01:58,786 --> 00:02:01,316
I got Chicago gettin' eight.
Less than a minute to go.

12
00:02:01,355 --> 00:02:05,155
Hang on! Just hang on.

13
00:02:05,193 --> 00:02:09,233
You didn't bet the Barber with my money,
did you, O'Neill? You're not that stupid.

14
00:02:09,263 --> 00:02:12,373
Shut up, Duffy. In 18 seconds,
you'll have your money.

15
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,800
[announcer] Oh, and he gets
hammered, and it goes!

16
00:02:14,835 --> 00:02:16,735
Shit!

17
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:22,412
Okay, if he makes both,
it's eight. I push. I'm even.

18
00:02:22,443 --> 00:02:25,653
Flagrant foul. He shoots that first.

19
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:29,449
- That's bullshit!
- If he makes all three, you're screwed.

20
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:32,553
[announcer continues, indistinct]

21
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:48,466
Grab him!

22
00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:53,741
[grunts] Get off of me!

23
00:02:54,942 --> 00:02:59,612
I'm first, O'Neill!
You always pay me first!

24
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:12,931
You wanna kick my ass?

25
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,230
- [car alarm blaring]
- [crowd murmurs]

26
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:21,769
No one can kick my ass better than I can.

27
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:27,205
[all gasp]

28
00:03:29,377 --> 00:03:31,647
[siren approaching]

29
00:03:33,347 --> 00:03:36,817
[man, faint] Hey, Conor, it's Ticky!

30
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:40,650
It's Ticky. It's Ticky!

31
00:03:41,422 --> 00:03:44,792
Conor! Yeah. Hey.

32
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,600
Ticky. Did you bring
money for the summons?

33
00:03:50,631 --> 00:03:52,901
What's that? Did you bring
money to get me out?

34
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:55,743
Damn, you got "zactly's" breath.
"Zactly's breath"?

35
00:03:55,769 --> 00:03:59,869
Your breath smells zactly like your ass.
Damn, that's nasty.

36
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:03,737
Did you pay them? They said it was 580.
I need the tickets.

37
00:04:03,777 --> 00:04:06,807
Which ones? You got two pair on
the floor for Bulls-Rockets.

38
00:04:06,847 --> 00:04:09,377
I'm gonna hawk those myself. The
game's not till 7:00. It's 5:00.

39
00:04:09,417 --> 00:04:12,947
What? Just tell me where they are.

40
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:15,656
[sighs] Shit. Come on.

41
00:04:17,525 --> 00:04:21,055
They're under the, uh,
religious statue on my dresser.

42
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,764
Wait, Ticky! You gotta get 1,200.

43
00:04:23,797 --> 00:04:28,397
Ticky, you gotta pay to get me out!
I already did.

44
00:04:43,351 --> 00:04:45,551
[water running]

45
00:04:47,087 --> 00:04:49,457
[tap turns off]

46
00:04:58,065 --> 00:04:59,765
[knock at door]

47
00:05:04,438 --> 00:05:06,768
Yeah? It's Ticky. Let me in.

48
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:10,537
Ticky. Thank God.
I really need that money.

49
00:05:10,578 --> 00:05:12,848
How much did you get for the tickets?

50
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,420
Jesus! [grunts] Hey, O'Neill.
Remember me?

51
00:05:17,451 --> 00:05:19,551
He grabbed me outside the United Centre.

52
00:05:19,587 --> 00:05:21,187
Yeah, you're the Barber's son. Yeah.

53
00:05:21,221 --> 00:05:25,891
O'Neill, do you even remember making that
phone call from Michael Pistone's wedding?

54
00:05:25,926 --> 00:05:28,456
Get off of me. You talked to me.

55
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:32,830
You said, "This is O'Neill,
number 55. What's my limit?"

56
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:34,836
So I check 55,
and I see you got six grand.

57
00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:39,108
So you put that six grand down on
Milwaukee, and, of course, they tank.

58
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:43,039
So now I gotta ask my old man about O'Neill
on 55, and guess what he tells me.

59
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:44,906
He tells me that guy
died four months ago.

60
00:05:44,945 --> 00:05:48,145
Look, tell the Barber... You bet six
grand on your dead father's account.

61
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:53,821
I need some money right now! Here,
I'll give you everything I got.

62
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:56,764
All right. That's a start.

63
00:05:57,725 --> 00:05:59,885
Relax. Mm-hmm.

64
00:06:16,977 --> 00:06:19,447
Forty-seven dollars.

65
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,480
[sighs]

66
00:06:27,655 --> 00:06:29,885
All right, you owe 6,600.

67
00:06:29,923 --> 00:06:32,993
You pay me a grand a week
until I say stop.

68
00:06:33,026 --> 00:06:37,796
That's ridiculous. 500. 750.
Bring it to the barber shop.

69
00:06:37,831 --> 00:06:41,171
You don want me to come back here.

70
00:06:41,201 --> 00:06:44,041
[bat clatters to floor]

71
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:47,741
- [exhales]
- [sighs, chuckles]

72
00:06:50,043 --> 00:06:52,653
I'm s... I...

73
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,550
They grabbed me outside
the United Centre!

74
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:16,966
Excuse me. I'm Conor O'Neill. I
got an 11:30 with James Fleming.

75
00:07:18,238 --> 00:07:22,808
Can you lend me... 12 grand?

76
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:28,822
- What, do you need to bury your father again?
- What?

77
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:30,519
Did you dig the guy up or something?

78
00:07:30,551 --> 00:07:33,521
What are you, freakin' sick? I'm sick?

79
00:07:34,522 --> 00:07:37,062
Four months ago
you come in here crying...

80
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:40,660
about how you need $5,000
to bury your old man.

81
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:43,204
I talked to Mahoney at Mikey's wedding.

82
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:47,840
It seems he also gave you 5,000 to bury the guy.
And I'm gonna pay Mahoney back.

83
00:07:47,868 --> 00:07:50,168
I don't give a shit
how much you owe Mahoney.

84
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:53,913
Listen, Jimmy, I'm really up
against it right now with Duffy...

85
00:07:53,941 --> 00:07:58,981
And I really don't give a shit
how much you owe the bookies.

86
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:06,847
Conor.

87
00:08:06,887 --> 00:08:09,557
Come back in here.

88
00:08:10,658 --> 00:08:14,558
You know, this... [door closes]

89
00:08:15,195 --> 00:08:18,025
Just might help you.

90
00:08:26,807 --> 00:08:29,837
Jimmy, this is only 500 bucks. I know.

91
00:08:29,877 --> 00:08:34,847
You're going to coach
a kids' baseball team with me.

92
00:08:34,882 --> 00:08:37,182
Jimmy, I don't think you understand
how serious my situation is.

93
00:08:37,217 --> 00:08:42,857
I'm gonna pay you $500 a week for the
next ten weeks. That's week one.

94
00:08:44,925 --> 00:08:48,695
Jimmy, I ain't no good with kids.
You know, Conor,

95
00:08:48,729 --> 00:08:52,299
I do this to give something
back to the community.

96
00:08:52,332 --> 00:08:55,972
You don't want to do it,
give me the check back.

97
00:08:57,337 --> 00:08:59,907
Uh, okay.

98
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:05,280
- So, I'll see you at the field tomorrow, 3:30.
- Where is it?

99
00:09:05,312 --> 00:09:10,152
Right behind that Baptist church
where you used to buy reefer.

100
00:09:10,183 --> 00:09:14,093
No, Jimmy, the only thing behind that
church is those shitty housing projects.

101
00:09:14,121 --> 00:09:17,061
I'll see you tomorrow.

Whoa, guys, don't touch the car.

121
00:10:13,747 --> 00:10:16,917
Yo, Coach Jimmy. Here's my extra inhaler,

122
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,720
and here's my Sugar Babies
for when my blood needs sugar.

123
00:10:19,753 --> 00:10:23,823
Mom says I do better when my blood's got sugar in it.
Whoa, what's your name again?

124
00:10:23,857 --> 00:10:27,357
Jefferson Albert Tibbs, Coach
Jimmy, but... Everybody listen!

125
00:10:27,394 --> 00:10:30,334
That gentleman behind you is Coach Conor.

126
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:35,273
He'll be taking over the
day-to-day operations. What?

127
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:38,812
- That bum guy's our coach?
- Coach Conor just stopped by...

128
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:43,739
to give you the equipment. Jimmy,
I can't do this by myself.

129
00:10:43,777 --> 00:10:47,007
Here's your roster, schedule,
Sugar Babies, inhaler.

130
00:10:47,047 --> 00:10:51,047
I gotta be in New York three weeks.
Training seminar. Couldn't be avoided.

131
00:10:51,084 --> 00:10:53,154
Hey, good luck.

132
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:57,726
Hey, wait, Jimmy. Wait, Jimmy! Wait.
What's wrong with that man?

133
00:10:57,758 --> 00:11:00,288
Wait, wait, wait!
How am I gonna get my money?

134
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:04,897
Every Monday, Ellen will have
a check for you. Gotta go.

135
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:10,304
Five hundred, right? 500.
Every Monday. You bet.

136
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:13,037
Every Monday. I'll see ya.

137
00:11:20,848 --> 00:11:24,048
- Andre Ray Peetes?
- 'Sup, my brother!

138
00:11:24,084 --> 00:11:27,224
[all laughing] What position do you play?

139
00:11:27,254 --> 00:11:32,194
Big Willie. Whatever, man...
Back catcher or centre field.

140
00:11:32,225 --> 00:11:37,225
- I got mad power. I pound the shit to the gate, yo!
- Damn right.

141
00:11:38,298 --> 00:11:41,128
Uh, Miles Pennfield II?

142
00:11:41,168 --> 00:11:43,798
This dude. Him.

143
00:11:44,471 --> 00:11:45,611
What position does he play?

144
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:49,508
He says he can pitch, Coach
Conor, but I might pitch too.

145
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:54,482
- What's your name?
- Jefferson Albert Tibbs. Mom says I can play anywhere.

146
00:11:54,514 --> 00:12:00,794
My asthma and all, I should probably play first.
I gotta keep my sugar up too.

147
00:12:00,821 --> 00:12:04,091
You know, Mom said that
some boys is plain big-boned.

148
00:12:04,124 --> 00:12:08,864
And some boys just plain fat-assed.
[all laughing]

149
00:12:08,896 --> 00:12:11,456
Hi. Matt Hyland,
head of the coaches' committee.

150
00:12:11,498 --> 00:12:13,198
You the Kekambas? What?

151
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:16,503
Are you the Kekambas? Yeah,
bitch, we the Kekambas.

152
00:12:16,536 --> 00:12:20,866
- So, what's up?
- [team mutters, laughs]

153
00:12:24,011 --> 00:12:29,381
Where's James Fleming from Smyth and Stevens
Securities? He's out of town on business.

154
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:32,346
I'm assisting. What do you
got... six or seven kids?

155
00:12:32,385 --> 00:12:36,515
If you can't field a team,
the league'll drop ya.

156
00:12:36,556 --> 00:12:38,786
I'll, uh, tell Coach Fleming...

157
00:12:38,826 --> 00:12:42,996
This is Darryl Mackey. He's president of the league.
Last year was a mess.

158
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:47,230
We had to cancel games because we'd show up,
and the other team would have five kids.

159
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:50,197
Waste of everybody's time.

160
00:12:50,237 --> 00:12:52,567
We're just trying to save everyone
a whole lot of trouble, okay?

161
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:56,005
If you can't field a nine-man team, why
don't you and the Kekambas go home?

162
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:00,550
Talk to Jimmy Fleming at
Smyth and Stevens Securities...

163
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:03,550

164
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:06,123
Friday. All right?

165
00:13:06,153 --> 00:13:11,993
[Jefferson] Yo, Coach. Kofi
and Ray Ray want to play.

166
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:15,295
Is that Kofi Evans
and, uh, Raymont Bennet?

167
00:13:15,328 --> 00:13:18,498
Yeah, Coach, but Miss Wilkes
ain't gonna let them play.

168
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:22,441
- [all chattering, protesting] - Wait, hey, hey!
Who's Miss Wilkes?

169
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:27,169
She teaches Saint Malachy. She gets
on my damn nerves, I swear to God!

170
00:13:27,207 --> 00:13:29,607
- She is real mean, Coach.
- She's an old nasty lady.

171
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:35,122
She tell your moms every little thing. Do you
know she called my house every night last year?

172
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:37,618
- Every night!
- She won't let these guys play?

173
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,220
[in unison] Hell, no! Coach,

174
00:13:39,252 --> 00:13:44,262
she telled they moms that they couldn't
play ball until they do these book reports.

175
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:47,431
- I can tell you anyway though, Kofi ain't doin' shit.
- Ray Ray neither, yo.

176
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:51,200
Them little suckers is like, "Bitch,
quit that noise." Hey, hey, hey!

177
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:54,901
Can we cool it with the "bitches"?

♪ [rap over radio, indistinct]

179
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,340
Aw, shit, man.

180
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:08,115
[Andre] Coach, it's gettin' kinda late.
We gotta go soon. We practicin' today?

181
00:14:08,148 --> 00:14:12,218
Not today. Thursday, 4:00 here.

182
00:14:12,252 --> 00:14:14,192
Cool.

183
00:14:15,923 --> 00:14:18,563
Miles, wait up!

184
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:22,231
Hey, my mom's meetin' me at Southside
Pizza, and I ain't walkin' by myself.

185
00:14:22,262 --> 00:14:23,262
I wanna go to Southside with you.

186
00:14:33,974 --> 00:14:36,684
Man, you wanna just cut up Ashland?
Whatever, man.

00:14:47,054 --> 00:14:49,164
Hey, you know about my
"kah-rah-tay," right?

190
00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:52,989
Man, do you mean "karate"?
Nah, it's "kah-rah-tay."

191
00:14:53,026 --> 00:14:55,926
Learned it from my cousin
who was in Japan in the army.

192
00:14:55,963 --> 00:14:59,003
Lightning quick! This is the tiger.

193
00:14:59,032 --> 00:15:04,072
No man can defend himself from the fury
of a well-trained karate tiger man.

194
00:15:04,104 --> 00:15:06,414
Yeah, Dre... a tiger. Okay.

195
00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:10,039
I only use the tiger when I'm
fightin', like, a dozen guys.

196
00:15:10,077 --> 00:15:11,637
More than that, I use the bear.

197
00:15:11,678 --> 00:15:14,278
What's the bear again? I can't show you!

198
00:15:14,314 --> 00:15:17,954
Man, that's the secret code
of the karate honor.

199

200
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:32,927
Hey, wait up!

00:15:42,742 --> 00:15:45,352
[woman] Yes? Sister Wilkes?

202
00:15:45,378 --> 00:15:51,048
I'm Conor O'Neill. I wanted
to talk to you about... Oh!

203
00:15:51,084 --> 00:15:53,224
I'm sorry.

204
00:15:53,253 --> 00:15:56,723
It's okay. It's just my head.

205
00:15:56,756 --> 00:15:58,556
Who are you here to see?

206
00:15:58,591 --> 00:15:59,991
Sister Wilkes. I'm Miss Wilkes.

207
00:16:03,096 --> 00:16:05,226
Do you teach here? Yes.

208
00:16:05,265 --> 00:16:10,235
Oh, I'm sorry. I was just
expecting, uh... older woman.

209
00:16:11,238 --> 00:16:13,408
Oh, well, I'm not a nun.

210
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,080
Thank God! [scoffs]

211
00:16:16,109 --> 00:16:18,479
I mean, that's great.

212
00:16:18,511 --> 00:16:20,481
[clears throat]

213
00:16:23,616 --> 00:16:27,616
Is Kofi Evans and
Raymont Bennet in your class?

214
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:29,524
Are they in my class.

215
00:16:29,556 --> 00:16:34,186
Yes, they're in my class. I need them
to play baseball for the Kekambas.

216
00:16:34,227 --> 00:16:40,097
Oh, yeah. I think that's something you
really should take up with their mothers.

217
00:16:40,133 --> 00:16:43,603
But the kids told me... Both mothers
agreed the boys need to read one book...

218
00:16:43,636 --> 00:16:45,736
before they start playing
baseball in the spring.

219
00:16:45,772 --> 00:16:47,612
Hey, I got no problem with that.

220
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:51,640
You know, I think reading's
real good for kids.

221
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:56,178
You work for Smyth and
Stevens Securities? Yes.

222
00:16:56,216 --> 00:16:58,716
- What deal did you blow?
- What?

223
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:03,261
Well, I'm sure you're not
coaching this team by choice.

224
00:17:04,457 --> 00:17:07,757
My associate, James Fleming,
is in New York for three weeks,

225
00:17:07,794 --> 00:17:12,504
so I, uh... I volunteered to help out.

226
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:16,402
I... I would have loved
to have coached that team.

227
00:17:16,436 --> 00:17:19,706
I was away on business... Canada...

228
00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:25,279
The day Mr Smyth and Mr
Stevens chose the team, and...

229
00:17:25,312 --> 00:17:28,652
Canada. That must have been nice.

230
00:17:28,681 --> 00:17:29,881
Lovely.

231
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:35,156
I was in the, uh, business
part the whole time. Mm-hmm.

232
00:17:35,188 --> 00:17:38,828
Well, I think it's wonderful that you're
teaching these boys to play baseball.

233
00:17:38,858 --> 00:17:43,128
I just think it's a shame no one
spends any time helping them to read.

234
00:17:44,464 --> 00:17:47,304
Listen, I'm Conor.

235
00:17:47,334 --> 00:17:49,604
Elizabeth.

236
00:17:49,636 --> 00:17:52,506
I'm only helping out
with the team for two weeks,

237
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:56,809
but I'm willing to get together
with you and help the boys out.

238
00:17:56,843 --> 00:18:01,613
Why don't we exchange numbers? I have a better idea.
Why don't I give you...

239
00:18:01,648 --> 00:18:05,518
a copy of the book the boys are supposed
to be reading, and you can read it.

240
00:18:05,552 --> 00:18:09,092
Then you can talk to Kofi
and Raymont about their reports.

241
00:18:10,857 --> 00:18:15,497
God. That would be great.

242
00:18:22,535 --> 00:18:24,895
Conor O'Neill, coach of the crack babies.

243
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:29,207
I can't coach that team. I've got to get out.
I'm serious. I'm bailin' out.

244
00:18:29,242 --> 00:18:32,512
How'd it go with the nuns?
God, she was beautiful.

245
00:18:32,545 --> 00:18:38,885
- Wh-Wh... You picked up a nun?
- Ticky, shut up.

246
00:18:38,918 --> 00:18:43,788
You still want your half of the Blackhawks
seats I got? Yeah. Where are they?

247
00:18:43,823 --> 00:18:45,863
I'm gettin' them tomorrow.

248
00:18:45,892 --> 00:18:50,232
Bring 'em to the baseball field on
Loomis tomorrow between 4:00 and 5:00.

249
00:18:50,263 --> 00:18:52,603
Loomis? That's the
friggin' projects! Hey.

250
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:56,772
Don't screw me, Ticky. I'm not in the mood
right now, all right? I need that money.

251
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:59,373
I'll be there at 5:00. Before 5:00.

252
00:18:59,406 --> 00:19:01,736
O'Neill. Easy, slugger.

253
00:19:01,774 --> 00:19:05,514
All right? Relax.

254
00:19:05,545 --> 00:19:11,345
You got some cabbage for me? Can
we talk outside, without the bat?

255
00:19:24,731 --> 00:19:26,031
Duffy, you knew my dad.

256
00:19:26,065 --> 00:19:28,935
And I wouldn't be callin' in a favor
if I wasn't completely racked.

257
00:19:28,968 --> 00:19:33,308
You smashed up my bar. You kn that I'll
pay it all back. I just need time.

258
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:37,510
It ain't my money.
Now, I can't carry you any more.

259
00:19:37,544 --> 00:19:40,954
I'll help with the book. Take bets.
I'll bring in business.

260
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,380
Nah. No, that's not gonna work.

261
00:19:45,485 --> 00:19:50,485
Listen, I gave them your name
because I couldn't carry you.

262
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:52,593
What?

263
00:19:54,361 --> 00:19:59,301
Are you telling me that some jag-off
goombah is gonna come and break my thumbs?

264
00:20:09,842 --> 00:20:13,312
[exhales] Duffy, I'm desperate.

I'm coaching a kids'
baseball team in the projects...

for a guy who's paying me 500 a week.

267
00:20:19,852 --> 00:20:21,922
But I'm paying the Barber off.
What should I do?

268
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:26,764
Should I tell the Barber to back off?
Should I start paying you every week?

269
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:34,272
Keep payin' the Barber,

270
00:20:34,301 --> 00:20:37,501

This is my sister's boy, Raymont.

00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:12,410
I spoke with Miss Wilkes. She said you
agreed to help with their assignments...

279
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:16,409
so they could play ball. Yeah,
that was before I had this...

Miss Wilkes said she had
a good feelin' about you,

281
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:22,318
so I figured I'd give it a try.
Miss Wilkes said that?

No. Actually, she said she had a good
feelin' about them all playin' ball.

Is he okay? Who are you?

325
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:24,294
I'm the coach. Conor O'Neill.

326
00:25:24,323 --> 00:25:26,933
Why did you keep them so late?

327
00:25:27,927 --> 00:25:30,157
Fool, I called you at Smyth and Stevens,

328
00:25:30,196 --> 00:25:32,826
and at first, some little girl
didn't even know who you were.

329
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:36,635
Then some man named Fleming got on the phone
and told me you were out of the office today.

330
00:25:36,669 --> 00:25:41,609
- Please, take my home number.
- You can't keep them boys out there after dark.

331
00:25:41,641 --> 00:25:44,011
Thank Jesus for Jefferson's strength.

332
00:25:47,714 --> 00:25:52,224
That smell? [sniffs]
That might be a lawsuit.

333
00:25:52,251 --> 00:25:57,091
Look at you. You don't even look
like you're holdin' it together.

334
00:26:00,226 --> 00:26:03,196
Jefferson, I'm sorry.

335
00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:07,169
I shoulda called practice,
you know, when it got dark.

336
00:26:08,167 --> 00:26:10,597
I just came by because, uh,

337
00:26:10,637 --> 00:26:13,937
as soon as you're ready
we expect you back, huh?

338
00:26:15,174 --> 00:26:17,684
And, uh,

339
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:21,710
I needed to know, uh,
what number uniform you wanted.

340
00:26:22,649 --> 00:26:25,689
You're never gonna stay being our coach.

341
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:35,130
[horn honks]

342
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,772
Enjoy the game.

343
00:26:42,802 --> 00:26:45,712
Hey. Nice wheels, soccer mom.

344
00:26:45,738 --> 00:26:49,138
Up yours. [chuckles]
What's with the wagon?

345
00:26:49,175 --> 00:26:53,105
The suits at Smyth and Stevens took shit from
one of the kids got beat up after practice,

346
00:26:53,145 --> 00:26:56,415
so they lent me this car
to get 'em all home.

347
00:26:56,448 --> 00:27:00,918
Ah, man. Who got beat up?
Who needs tickets?

348
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:03,693
Jefferson Tibbs. That's
the fat kid, right?

349
00:27:04,256 --> 00:27:06,026
Yeah... How'd you know?

350
00:27:06,058 --> 00:27:08,428
You told me about every kid on the team.

351
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:12,730
Aw, shit. I hate it when people mess with kids.
Jesus. It's so wrong.

352
00:27:12,765 --> 00:27:17,035
How can I help you fellas? Mister, you
just sold us tickets to last night's game.

353
00:27:17,069 --> 00:27:21,639
Get outta here! Don't make me freakin' shoot you!
When a man needs crack, a man needs crack!

354
00:27:26,713 --> 00:27:29,683
- You're unbelievable, man.
- Need seats? Need two?

355
00:27:29,716 --> 00:27:31,976
How we doin' tonight? "We"?

356
00:27:32,018 --> 00:27:35,218
We aren't doin' so good. San
Jose's not such a hot ticket.

357
00:27:36,789 --> 00:27:38,959
Did the Bulls cover last night?
Yeah, they won by nine.

358
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:41,791
Shit. I couldn't get any action.

359
00:27:41,828 --> 00:27:44,398
I need to find someone
who'll take a big bet.

360
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:47,030
Fink's minimum bet's two grand.

361
00:27:47,066 --> 00:27:49,696
The guy at the cement plant?
Yeah, Fink the cement guy. Why?

362
00:27:49,736 --> 00:27:53,136
I wanna lay 12 G's. 12 grand? On what?

363
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:57,782
Since Jordan left, the Bulls have
never covered at home against Miami.

364
00:27:57,810 --> 00:28:00,450
You serious about this? They
play Miami on the 26th.

365
00:28:00,479 --> 00:28:03,249
You shouldn't do this.
I don't have a choice.

366
00:28:03,282 --> 00:28:05,822
Take me to meet Fink.

367
00:28:07,219 --> 00:28:10,159
Come on. [man] Programs here!

368
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:13,789
Okay. Okay. I'll take you to see Fink.

369
00:28:13,826 --> 00:28:15,186
Sell some tickets.

370
00:28:15,227 --> 00:28:19,467
Need tickets, folks? Who needs tickets?
Who needs tickets?

371
00:28:19,498 --> 00:28:22,068
- Pay up, bitch!
- I'll kick your ass, bitch!

372
00:28:22,101 --> 00:28:25,371
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Cool it!
[all shouting]

373
00:28:25,404 --> 00:28:27,314
Cool it! What's goin' on?

374
00:28:27,339 --> 00:28:30,179
All right. Let me break it
down to you right quick.

375
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:32,949
Andre say he can catch any
pop-up ball anybody can throw.

376
00:28:32,979 --> 00:28:35,749
Kofi say, "That's bullshit. You a busta."

377
00:28:35,782 --> 00:28:40,252
Andre say, "Roll up, bitch." Kofi say, "I'll
give you all my gum if you catch this ball."

378
00:28:40,286 --> 00:28:44,086
He threw the ball. Andre caught it.
Andre say, "Pay me my money."

379
00:28:44,123 --> 00:28:46,833
Kofi say, "You a cheatin'
bitch." No, wait.

380
00:28:46,859 --> 00:28:50,929
- Kofi say, "You a motherf..."
- Okay, I got it. Thanks.

381
00:28:53,165 --> 00:28:56,795
Okay, I want everybody
to take a position. Let's go.

Way to use your head, Jamal.

402
00:30:15,081 --> 00:30:18,821
It's cool, Jamal, man.
Don't worry about it.

403
00:30:55,321 --> 00:30:56,861
Aah!

404
00:31:40,466 --> 00:31:43,666
"Four Spanish men with hiking
boots had surrounded me close.

405
00:31:43,702 --> 00:31:48,672
"I could tell they were banditos because they
had taco breath and they called me 'hombre.'

406
00:31:48,707 --> 00:31:52,407
"I spun around and hit the biggest one.
I punched him in the gut.

407
00:31:52,444 --> 00:31:54,614
"And as he was falling,
he grabbed my backpack.

408
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:59,686
"I said, 'Stop, you banditos! I don't
want to have to hit anyone else.'

409
00:31:59,718 --> 00:32:04,318
"But because they were Spanish,
they didn't understand me.

410
00:32:04,356 --> 00:32:08,326
"Two more jumped me, and I hit one
of them in his..." Between his legs.

411
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:14,070
"My mouth banged on his head, and that
was where I got my fat lip. The end."

412
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:17,000
So where'd you get your fat butt?

413
00:32:17,036 --> 00:32:20,506
Andre, that's enough. That
was very nice, Jefferson.

414
00:32:20,539 --> 00:32:26,049
Excellent use of the first-person narrative.
I was scared of the banditos.

415
00:32:26,078 --> 00:32:28,448
It was good. Okay, sit down.

416
00:32:36,155 --> 00:32:40,425
- Miss Wilkes.
- Mr O'Neill. Fresh from the office?

417
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:44,499
Yo, Coach. Why don't you invite your pants
down to your shoes so they can party?

418
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:47,330
[kids laugh] Everyone,
this is Mr O'Neill,

419
00:32:47,366 --> 00:32:50,296
who coaches a baseball team that
some of our young men play on.

420
00:32:50,336 --> 00:32:54,066
He's taken the time out of his
busy day to give us a hand.

421
00:32:54,106 --> 00:32:56,376
So give him your attention.

422
00:32:59,345 --> 00:33:04,675
A Wrinkle in Time is an important book.

423
00:33:04,716 --> 00:33:08,116
- I liked it very much.
- [kids laugh]

424
00:33:14,393 --> 00:33:17,103
I'm just sayin' it ain't like that.

425
00:33:17,129 --> 00:33:21,699
Fantasy ain't reality. I like
to read stuff that's real.

426
00:33:21,733 --> 00:33:24,173
Give me an example.
Michael Jordan's book.

427
00:33:24,203 --> 00:33:26,813
- Nice book, man.
- Excellent choice.

428
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:30,238
A strong piece of literature,
a great read.

429
00:33:30,276 --> 00:33:34,646
- Yeah.
- That's a biography. That's the real story of his life.

430
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,180
This is fiction. The story's made up.

431
00:33:37,216 --> 00:33:41,546
It's meant to entertain you
and make you think.

432
00:33:41,587 --> 00:33:46,327
Kofi, you've been silent this whole time.
All you've said is you didn't like it.

433
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:48,028
That's right.

434
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:52,130
Well, if you can't say more, I'm going to have
to assume that you didn't really read it,

435
00:33:53,565 --> 00:33:56,435
and your mother's gonna
want me to call her.

436
00:33:59,371 --> 00:34:02,271
- Did you read the book?
- Yeah.

437
00:34:02,308 --> 00:34:06,108
- Tell me something about it.
- It was booty.

438
00:34:06,145 --> 00:34:08,675
[kids laugh]

439
00:34:08,714 --> 00:34:11,784
Okay. I'm gonna call your mom tonight.

440
00:34:11,817 --> 00:34:14,547
That girl Meg is dumb.

441
00:34:14,586 --> 00:34:17,816
She think her father
comin' back from wherever.

442
00:34:17,856 --> 00:34:20,286
That's stupid to believe in.

443
00:34:20,326 --> 00:34:23,426
That girl and her mom is both trippin'.

444
00:34:24,596 --> 00:34:29,136
'Cause where I'm from,
don't nobody's father come back.

445
00:34:40,779 --> 00:34:44,349
[bat hitting ball] [boy] Come
on, right here, right here!

446
00:34:45,351 --> 00:34:48,151
Yo, let's do this! I'm ready to beat 'em!

447
00:34:48,187 --> 00:34:50,387
Come on! Hurry up!

448
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:54,792
Maybe this year you could turn a double play.
Got the uniforms, Coach,

449
00:34:54,826 --> 00:34:58,356
and... your check.

450
00:34:58,397 --> 00:35:00,597
I take it you're not staying.
Sorry. Can't.

451
00:35:00,632 --> 00:35:04,272
Next time. Good luck today.

452
00:35:04,303 --> 00:35:09,483
Thanks. Thanks for giving
back to the community,

453
00:35:09,508 --> 00:35:10,708
dickhead.

454
00:35:10,742 --> 00:35:14,882
- I want number seven like last time.
- I want number four!

455
00:35:14,913 --> 00:35:17,423
Find a shirt that fits
and put it on, okay?

456
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:20,789
- This shirt smells like my grandma.
- [chuckles]

458
00:35:23,189 --> 00:35:27,159
Coach. Good to see you, Jefferson.

459
00:35:27,193 --> 00:35:30,363
Who's got number 11?
Coach, I got it here.

460
00:35:30,396 --> 00:35:33,566
Thanks. Jefferson, this is the
biggest shirt we got, all right?

461
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:38,299
Everyone, the shirts go up in sizes from
two to 11, okay? Coach, I need a shirt.

462
00:35:39,938 --> 00:35:42,338
- Who's got number ten?
- I got it.

463
00:35:42,374 --> 00:35:45,314
Give it to Jamal. Where's my shirt?

464
00:35:47,813 --> 00:35:51,653
Hey, guys. Guys? Why don't you
guys play catch in the outfield?

465
00:35:51,683 --> 00:35:56,223
Okay? Warm up. G, hang on. Hang on.
I wanna talk to you.

466
00:36:01,293 --> 00:36:05,603
How old are you? I'll be nine in October.

467
00:36:05,631 --> 00:36:10,901
Well, you're supposed to be nine before
August to, uh, play in this league.

468
00:36:10,936 --> 00:36:15,166
But-But I wanna play. [sniffling]

469
00:36:16,875 --> 00:36:19,645
G... G,

470
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:24,319
there's only ten uniforms, 11 players.

471
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:27,450
So I gotta give the guys
who are old enough first pick.

472
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:35,760
- But I'm on the team, right?
- Hell, yeah!

00:50:11,409 --> 00:50:16,209
[chuckling] I'm not sure. Where?

651
00:50:16,247 --> 00:50:20,117
It's on the corner of Clark
and Addison... Slugger's.

652
00:50:20,151 --> 00:50:23,391
How 'bout, uh, 9:00?

653
00:50:23,421 --> 00:50:28,061
9:00. Clark and Addison.
Clark and Addison.

654
00:50:28,093 --> 00:50:29,793
All right. All right?

655
00:50:29,827 --> 00:50:31,257
Yeah.

656
00:50:47,745 --> 00:50:49,445
Did you miss a payment with the Barber?

657
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:51,280
Yeah. I shined him this week. Why?

658
00:50:51,316 --> 00:50:53,676
That goofy dork Gino came
into Duffy's asking for you.

659
00:50:53,718 --> 00:50:56,048
Oh, Jesus.

660
00:50:58,423 --> 00:50:59,623
Fink.

661
00:51:01,526 --> 00:51:03,286
Ticky, this is Ed. Ed.

662
00:51:03,328 --> 00:51:05,858
- How you doin'?
- Pleasure.

663
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:09,696
This is Conor O'Neill.
He wanted to meet you.

664
00:51:09,734 --> 00:51:10,744
What do you do for money?

665
00:51:10,768 --> 00:51:13,598
I'm a trader at Smyth and Stevens.

666
00:51:13,638 --> 00:51:17,178
Bullshit. First lie.

667
00:51:17,208 --> 00:51:21,178
You gonna try to beat me one time so
you can pay off whoever else you owe?

668
00:51:21,212 --> 00:51:22,712
I wanna make a big bet. How big?

669
00:51:22,747 --> 00:51:27,317
Twelve grand. And?

670
00:51:27,352 --> 00:51:31,722
And, if I win, I wanna get paid.

671
00:51:31,756 --> 00:51:34,526
No bullshit to keep betting.

672
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:37,659
This guy's too serious.

673
00:51:37,695 --> 00:51:42,495
I got a handful of clients, they lay a hundred
grand a week, and they're not emotional.

674
00:51:42,533 --> 00:51:47,413
I can cover it. You seem too emotional
about this 12 grand. Desperate.

675
00:51:47,438 --> 00:51:48,238
What are you, a psychiatrist or a bookie?

676
00:51:51,442 --> 00:51:52,282
Don't you want your number?

677
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:57,150
You gonna take my bet?

678
00:51:57,182 --> 00:51:58,552
Ed, what's the next number?

679
00:51:58,583 --> 00:52:05,123
Twenty-seven. You're account 27 when you call in.
And your handle is?

680
00:52:05,556 --> 00:52:07,486
Kekambas.

681
00:52:07,525 --> 00:52:10,125
What? Kekambas?

682
00:52:11,262 --> 00:52:13,162
Kekambas. Ed, you got it?

683
00:52:13,198 --> 00:52:16,528
Got it. You're a strange kid, Kekambas.

684
00:52:16,567 --> 00:52:21,537
I'm interested to see
what happens with you.

685
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:37,360
O'Neill! Gino, get him.

686
00:53:35,646 --> 00:53:37,716
Aw, fuck this.

687
00:53:44,822 --> 00:53:47,462
Account 27. Kekambas.

688
00:53:47,492 --> 00:53:51,332
Yeah. What's the line on Chicago
tomorrow night against Miami?

689
00:53:52,897 --> 00:53:55,467
Gimme Miami minus six. Twelve grand.

690
00:53:58,035 --> 00:54:00,805
Wait. Wait.

691
00:54:00,838 --> 00:54:04,638
I'll take Chicago and the six points.

692
00:54:04,675 --> 00:54:06,775
Yeah. Twelve thousand.

693
00:54:23,394 --> 00:54:25,834
Conor, hi. Hey.

694
00:54:28,666 --> 00:54:30,026
Let's eat. Okay.

695
00:54:30,067 --> 00:54:32,797
Why don't we sit?

696
00:54:36,507 --> 00:54:39,877
So... I wanted to talk to you.

697
00:54:39,910 --> 00:54:43,280
Yeah, I wanted to talk to you too.

698
00:54:44,482 --> 00:54:47,922
So, uh, do you want a drink?

699
00:54:47,952 --> 00:54:49,722
No.

700
00:54:49,754 --> 00:54:52,294
What's wrong?

701
00:54:54,759 --> 00:54:57,859
I come here all the time
with the guys I work with.

702
00:54:57,895 --> 00:55:01,565
Look, I know you don't work
at Smyth and Stevens.

703
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:05,970
Look at you. I could tell right
away you weren't a broker.

704
00:55:06,003 --> 00:55:07,943
What's that mean?

705
00:55:07,972 --> 00:55:12,542
Nothing. You just don't look like someone
that works at Smyth and Stevens.

706
00:55:14,111 --> 00:55:16,481
You look like a freakin'
boring schoolteacher.

707
00:55:18,416 --> 00:55:20,176
[sighs]

708
00:55:24,054 --> 00:55:25,724
Hey. Elizabeth!

709
00:55:25,756 --> 00:55:30,526
Elizabeth. Hey. Why'd you come here?

710
00:55:30,561 --> 00:55:34,401
To bust me in the lie about
where I work? You win.

711
00:55:34,432 --> 00:55:37,802
You coach my kids. I thought
we had a common interest.

712
00:55:37,835 --> 00:55:41,705
Elizabeth, I get paid under
the table to coach that team.

713
00:55:41,739 --> 00:55:44,609
And I only do that because I'm
in a big hole with two bookies

714
00:55:44,642 --> 00:55:48,882
who are lookin' to kill me. Yeah.

715
00:55:48,913 --> 00:55:51,553
What? Nothing.

716
00:55:52,149 --> 00:55:54,119
You know all this.

717
00:55:54,151 --> 00:55:57,721
I spoke to Jimmy Fleming after
Jefferson got beat up. He told me.

718
00:55:57,755 --> 00:56:00,985
You just think I'm a big joke. No.

719
00:56:01,025 --> 00:56:04,995
It's people like me that make people like
you feel better about your tiny life.

720
00:56:05,029 --> 00:56:07,729
This is unbelievable. I can't
believe I came down here for this.

721
00:56:07,765 --> 00:56:11,935
Yeah? Then why did you come
if you know I'm a liar?

722
00:56:11,969 --> 00:56:16,039
Because those kids trust you.
And they don't trust anybody.

723
00:56:16,073 --> 00:56:18,583
I told you, I coach for money.

724
00:56:18,609 --> 00:56:22,149
Well, I teach for money. I've had some
of the best fifth-graders in the world,

725
00:56:22,179 --> 00:56:25,819
but some of them don't make it because they don't
have anybody besides their mother or me...

726
00:56:25,850 --> 00:56:28,190
telling them what to do.

727
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:30,558
So what?

728
00:56:30,588 --> 00:56:31,958
I'm done with all that.

729
00:56:33,157 --> 00:56:34,157
Well, I just came down here...

730
00:56:34,191 --> 00:56:38,761
to see what they see,
because they're never wrong.

731
00:56:38,796 --> 00:56:43,166
Take a good look. See what they see.

732
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:47,100
I came to talk to you about a job. Yeah?

733
00:56:47,137 --> 00:56:50,107
Well, unless it pays 12 grand an hour,

734
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:53,640
I'm not interested.

735
00:57:03,821 --> 00:57:06,821
Conor.

736
00:57:06,857 --> 00:57:08,527
Hey. Did you play it?

737
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:10,529
Yeah. Twelve grand. Twelve grand? Yes!

738
00:57:10,561 --> 00:57:12,461
Coach! Can we have a word?

739
00:57:12,497 --> 00:57:15,027
How many points you givin'?

740
00:57:15,065 --> 00:57:16,825
I'm getting six.

741
00:57:18,569 --> 00:57:20,239
You took Chicago?

742
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:21,970
Are you on crack? You
laid 12 grand on those...

743
00:57:22,006 --> 00:57:23,706
Shut up, Ticky. I'm under a
lot of pressure right now.

744
00:57:23,741 --> 00:57:27,981
- I said now!
- Win or lose, I'm outta here.

745
00:57:34,919 --> 00:57:36,389
Darryl Mackey, league's president.
We met.

746
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:41,090
Coach, we're concerned about the age
of some of the boys on your team.

747
00:57:41,125 --> 00:57:45,725
Can you produce birth
certificates for your players?

748
00:57:45,763 --> 00:57:50,703
All I got is what Coach Fleming
from Smyth and Stevens gave me.

749
00:57:53,538 --> 00:57:58,508
- Here they are.
- What are the names of those two boys at second base?

750
00:57:59,610 --> 00:58:03,510
- Andre and Jamal.
- Which one's Jamal?

751
00:58:03,548 --> 00:58:06,048
The taller one.

752
00:58:09,620 --> 00:58:11,160
This birth certificate's been altered.

753
00:58:11,188 --> 00:58:12,858
What?

754
00:58:12,890 --> 00:58:14,860
The eight's been turned into a nine.

755
00:58:14,892 --> 00:58:18,862
You have to be born
after September of '88.

756
00:58:18,896 --> 00:58:22,766
Well, the kid is out of the league,
and the Kekambas are on probation.

757
00:58:25,836 --> 00:58:28,936
Look, what are you guys? The cops?

758
00:58:28,973 --> 00:58:30,343
What's the point of the league, Coach?

759
00:58:30,374 --> 00:58:33,614
To teach kids it's okay to lie, as
long as they can get away with it?

760
00:58:34,645 --> 00:58:36,705
It should be about
these kids playing ball,

761
00:58:36,747 --> 00:58:39,177
not the trophy you bring to work.

762
00:58:39,216 --> 00:58:42,716
Look, the kid goes now.

763
00:58:42,753 --> 00:58:44,693
Okay?

764
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:51,260
Jefferson bats seventh, plays first base.

765
00:58:51,295 --> 00:58:56,025
Miles pitches and bats eighth, and
Clarence, you play third and bat ninth.

766
00:58:56,066 --> 00:58:58,036
Cool. Okay, let's go.

767
00:58:58,068 --> 00:59:00,338
[kids chattering]

768
00:59:04,208 --> 00:59:06,978
Why I not playin'? You mad at me?

769
00:59:07,011 --> 00:59:10,011
Jamal, the other coach... 'Cause
I'm sorry about pushing Ray Ray.

770
00:59:10,047 --> 00:59:13,117
I just want to play.

771
00:59:13,150 --> 00:59:15,920
Listen, they know that you changed your
birth certificate. I can't let you play.

772
00:59:17,354 --> 00:59:19,024
But my mom said it was okay.

773
00:59:19,056 --> 00:59:23,986
She said that she would tell them if they asked
if I was born later. She said it was okay.

774
00:59:24,028 --> 00:59:26,858
I just wanna play. There's
nothin' I can do, Jamal.

775
00:59:26,897 --> 00:59:30,067
Look, why don't you just sit...

776
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:32,170
Jamal!

777
00:59:40,745 --> 00:59:43,105
[boy] Miles, do your stuff now.

778
00:59:48,853 --> 00:59:50,693
Strike.

779
00:59:51,255 --> 00:59:52,855
Strike.

780
00:59:54,158 --> 00:59:55,388
Strike! Out.

781
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:59,995
- Yeah, baby. That's what I'm
talkin' about. - [sighs]

782
01:00:01,899 --> 01:00:03,929
Time, Blue.

783
01:00:05,069 --> 01:00:08,139
I can't have this kid out here
with these things on.

784
01:00:09,239 --> 01:00:11,909
What now? Coach, we're
just all in agreement.

785
01:00:11,942 --> 01:00:13,982
The kid can't wear headphones
while he pitches.

786
01:00:14,011 --> 01:00:17,381
Matt makes a good point about safety.

787
01:00:17,414 --> 01:00:19,954
- Come on. You're kidding me, right?
- Think about it.

788
01:00:19,984 --> 01:00:24,194
What if he gets hurt because he can't
hear in a dangerous situation?

789
01:00:24,221 --> 01:00:27,791
There's liability issues.
Bring it in, fellas.

790
01:00:27,825 --> 01:00:31,195
Come on, bring it in. Bring it in.
What are you doing?

791
01:00:31,228 --> 01:00:33,758
I want you guys to explain
to them why they lost Jamal...

792
01:00:33,798 --> 01:00:36,298
and why Miles can't wear headphones,

793
01:00:36,333 --> 01:00:39,843
and why the Bua Was and
the Waatas have nice uniforms,

794
01:00:39,870 --> 01:00:41,310
and we have shitty T-shirts.

795
01:00:41,338 --> 01:00:44,938
Easy, Coach. You're already on a warning.

796
01:00:46,376 --> 01:00:49,976
Kekambas. This is the president...

797
01:00:50,014 --> 01:00:53,424
and that is the coach of the
goofiest team in the league.

798
01:00:53,450 --> 01:00:58,290
And they kicked Jamal off the team
because he was born two weeks early,

799
01:00:58,322 --> 01:01:00,832
and now they're makin' Miles
take his headphones off...

800
01:01:00,858 --> 01:01:02,958
'cause he's pitching too good.

801
01:01:02,993 --> 01:01:04,433
It's a safety issue. Look, fellas.

802
01:01:04,461 --> 01:01:09,131
Fellas, you have to understand that
everyone has to follow the same rules.

803
01:01:09,166 --> 01:01:13,096
That's some weak-ass bullshit, you
bitch-ass, mother-freakin' bustas.

804
01:01:13,137 --> 01:01:17,307
[Kekambas complaining] What did you say?

805
01:01:17,341 --> 01:01:21,081
I believe he said, "That is
some weak-ass bullshit."

806
01:01:21,111 --> 01:01:24,151
- Was that it, G-Baby?
- Yeah, that's it.

807
01:01:24,181 --> 01:01:28,851
You are on thin ice, pal! I could
have you removed from this league.

808
01:01:28,886 --> 01:01:30,756
- This is my last game.
- What?

809
01:01:30,788 --> 01:01:32,488
I quit. What?

810
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:35,862
I'm out.

811
01:01:35,893 --> 01:01:37,933
I got business out of town.
All right, listen up.

812
01:01:37,962 --> 01:01:42,102
Kekambas, back on the field.
Son, no headphones.

813
01:01:42,132 --> 01:01:46,242
Coaches, get back to the dugouts.

814
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:53,239
Come on, let's go. Get out there.

815
01:01:54,311 --> 01:01:57,011
Come on! Let's go!

816
01:01:59,149 --> 01:02:03,919
What'd you expect? I was gonna
coach this team the whole year?

817
01:02:04,889 --> 01:02:07,119
[muttering]

818

[woman] Yes?

990
01:14:36,806 --> 01:14:41,036
- Missed me.
- Conor O'Neill.

991
01:14:43,279 --> 01:14:46,619
I wanted to apologize
for the other night.

992
01:14:46,650 --> 01:14:51,660
Well, I have had better dates.
Yeah. I'm sorry.

993
01:14:54,891 --> 01:14:57,991
I heard about the baseball game.
The boys loved it.

994
01:14:58,027 --> 01:15:02,567
Yeah. It worked. We've won
three in a row since then.

995
01:15:02,599 --> 01:15:03,899
Do you have any idea
how much that meant to them?

996
01:15:09,238 --> 01:15:10,538
I was thinking...

997
01:15:10,574 --> 01:15:15,684
how the other night you knew that
I wasn't really a stock trader...

998
01:15:15,712 --> 01:15:18,312
and that I had a big gambling debt.

999
01:15:18,347 --> 01:15:21,717
And if you were there to offer me a job,

1000
01:15:21,751 --> 01:15:24,591
it might still stand.

1001
01:15:24,621 --> 01:15:27,661
So you're not here to ask me out?

1002
01:15:29,793 --> 01:15:31,133
Uh, no.

1003
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:33,930
Okay.

1004
01:15:33,963 --> 01:15:37,103
Am I supposed to be?

1005
01:15:37,133 --> 01:15:39,603
Uh...

1006
01:15:40,937 --> 01:15:45,107
- We need a physical activities coordinator.
- You and me?

1007
01:15:45,141 --> 01:15:47,681
[chuckles] The school.

1008
01:15:50,079 --> 01:15:52,779
You know, someone to supervise

1009
01:15:52,816 --> 01:15:55,076
organize games and sports.

1010
01:15:55,118 --> 01:15:58,988
We'd really like to get a guy
because... I think you like me.

1011
01:15:59,022 --> 01:16:03,292
What? I just got this gut feeling
that when you were laughing at me,

1012
01:16:03,326 --> 01:16:07,726
that you like me.

1013
01:16:09,332 --> 01:16:10,872

01:25:29,458 --> 01:25:33,628
[crowd chanting] Let's go.
Let's go, Bua Was, let's go!

1147
01:25:33,662 --> 01:25:36,402
Let's go Bua Was! Let's go! G-Baby.

1148
01:25:38,267 --> 01:25:41,597
- You're up.
- Yeah!

1149
01:25:44,473 --> 01:25:46,243
Time, Blue.

1150
01:25:46,275 --> 01:25:49,505
I've got Jarius Evans
batting for Jefferson Tibbs.

1151
01:25:58,954 --> 01:26:02,464
All right. Wednesday night practice.

1152
01:26:02,491 --> 01:26:05,231
Thanks for the uniform, Coach.

1153
01:26:05,261 --> 01:26:08,301
Thanks, Coach. Right. See you guys later.

1154
01:26:15,371 --> 01:26:17,941
Hey, kid. You can't
come in there right now.

1155
01:26:17,973 --> 01:26:20,413
How long is it gonna be? Don't know.

1156
01:26:23,979 --> 01:26:25,679
Jamal, what's up?

1157
01:26:32,955 --> 01:26:34,615
Why can't we go in right now?

1158
01:26:34,657 --> 01:26:40,557
They're waitin' to cap somebody inside.
What're we gonna do?

1159
01:26:40,596 --> 01:26:42,566
Come on.

1160
01:26:58,013 --> 01:26:59,983
- [kid shouting]
- Shit! Come on.

1161
01:27:00,015 --> 01:27:03,385
Move! Come on, man!

1162
01:27:03,419 --> 01:27:05,649
[tires squealing] Get in the car, man!

1163
01:27:05,688 --> 01:27:08,018
Quiet. They'll pass by. Come here!

1164
01:27:08,056 --> 01:27:09,786
What's up?

1165
01:27:20,536 --> 01:27:22,336
Oh, shit!

1166
01:27:26,375 --> 01:27:27,775
[all shouting]

1167
01:27:29,111 --> 01:27:32,621
Get outta here! Come on! It's all right.
We're okay.

1168
01:27:36,352 --> 01:27:36,822
G, we're okay.

1169
01:27:43,526 --> 01:27:47,756
G, come on, get up. Come on. Come on, G.

1170
01:27:47,796 --> 01:27:50,396
[crying] Come on.

1171
01:27:55,103 --> 01:28:00,883
It's okay. We'll just wait
for somebody to come.

1172
01:28:00,909 --> 01:28:02,549
It'll be okay.

1173
01:28:05,414 --> 01:28:06,624
It'll be okay.

1174
01:28:08,851 --> 01:28:10,551
[sirens wailing]

1175
01:28:12,621 --> 01:28:14,691
It'll be okay.

1176
01:28:15,057 --> 01:28:17,387
It'll be okay.

1177
01:28:35,378 --> 01:28:38,708
[phone ringing]

1178
01:28:45,020 --> 01:28:47,420
Yeah?

1179
01:28:47,456 --> 01:28:49,586
Yeah, Elizabeth?

1180
01:28:52,728 --> 01:28:54,498
What?

1181
01:28:59,735 --> 01:29:01,335

On Jarius' behalf.

1194

[clears throat]

1197
01:30:51,146 --> 01:30:52,616
Jarius was a player...

1198
01:30:52,648 --> 01:30:56,018
on the Kekambas baseball team
that I coach.

1199
01:30:58,754 --> 01:31:02,534
Honestly, he, uh...
He was too young to play.

1200
01:31:03,959 --> 01:31:07,999
But he wanted to be a part of
the team so badly that, uh...

1201
01:31:08,030 --> 01:31:09,830
I couldn't say no.

1202
01:31:09,865 --> 01:31:12,095
G-Baby. You're up.

1203
01:31:12,134 --> 01:31:14,974
He had a great smile too.

I know I'm not telling you
anything you don't know.

1205
01:31:19,742 --> 01:31:22,712
I've got Jarius Evans
batting for Jefferson Tibbs.

1206
01:31:22,745 --> 01:31:24,575
He was a really tough guy.

1207
01:31:24,613 --> 01:31:28,623
Just a boy, really, who, uh...

1208
01:31:28,651 --> 01:31:31,851
wanted to be around his older brother.

1209
01:31:31,887 --> 01:31:35,687
Hang on, Coach. I don't have Jarius
Evans on this roster anywhere.

1210
01:31:39,227 --> 01:31:43,597
Oh, you know what?
There he is. He's okay.

1211
01:31:43,632 --> 01:31:46,002
The other day...

1212
01:31:46,034 --> 01:31:49,974
we played a really important
game against a good team.

1213
01:31:51,640 --> 01:31:54,310
And, two outs in the last inning...

1214
01:31:54,342 --> 01:31:56,282
G-Baby.

1215
01:31:56,311 --> 01:31:59,051
...I had no choice but to let Jarius bat.

1216
01:31:59,081 --> 01:32:01,981
You can swing if you want,
but you don't have to.

1217
01:32:02,017 --> 01:32:05,287
Okay. If you go down looking,
none of us care.

1218
01:32:05,320 --> 01:32:07,960
But if you want to swing, swing.

1219
01:32:07,990 --> 01:32:13,130
Get back in there. Do what you feel.
Okay.

1220
01:32:13,161 --> 01:32:16,601
He was fearless
as he stepped to the plate.

1221
01:32:17,666 --> 01:32:19,866
I was terrified for him.

1222
01:32:50,098 --> 01:32:54,768
With two strikes
and our hopes dwindling...

1223
01:33:03,746 --> 01:33:06,716
he hit a shot down the first baseline.

1224
01:33:19,427 --> 01:33:21,127
We won the game.

1225
01:33:26,134 --> 01:33:29,244
And watching him...

1226
01:33:29,271 --> 01:33:32,841
raise his arms in triumph...

1227
01:33:32,875 --> 01:33:35,735
as he ran to first base,

1228
01:33:37,412 --> 01:33:39,182
I swear...

1229
01:33:39,214 --> 01:33:42,894
I was lifted in that moment
to a better place.

1230
01:33:46,254 --> 01:33:49,064
I swear he, uh...

1231
01:33:49,091 --> 01:33:52,231
He lifted the world in that moment.

1232
01:34:01,236 --> 01:34:05,936
He made me a... better person...

1233
01:34:07,175 --> 01:34:10,045
even if just for that moment.

1234
01:34:14,449 --> 01:34:16,819
I am, uh...

1235
01:34:17,920 --> 01:34:20,690
forever grateful to Jarius for that.

1236
01:35:18,814 --> 01:35:23,354
That was nice, what you said.

1237
01:35:23,385 --> 01:35:27,815
His mother was very moved. Thank you.

1238
01:35:29,191 --> 01:35:30,531
Wait.

1239
01:35:30,558 --> 01:35:35,298
There's some people who want to talk
to you about the baseball team.

1240
01:35:35,330 --> 01:35:40,540
The team is done. That's what
they want to talk to you about.

1241
01:35:40,568 --> 01:35:42,038
They're in the auditorium.

1242
01:36:09,297 --> 01:36:12,997
We know the league wants to
cancel the championship game.

1243
01:36:13,035 --> 01:36:17,535
Mom said it was all up to us
'cause of G-Baby.

1244
01:36:17,572 --> 01:36:22,382
Yeah. It's over.
You guys don't have to play.

1245
01:36:22,410 --> 01:36:26,510
You guys had a great year.

1246
01:36:26,548 --> 01:36:30,188
You can keep the uniforms.

1247
01:36:30,218 --> 01:36:34,558
- Wait. You're quitting again?
- What do you mean?

1248
01:36:34,589 --> 01:36:37,289
We wanna play, bitch. Yeah, man.

1249
01:36:37,325 --> 01:36:40,325
[all agreeing]

1250
01:36:40,362 --> 01:36:42,602
- You guys wanna play?
- [all] Hell, yeah!

1251
01:36:42,630 --> 01:36:45,200
[Andre] For G-Baby.

1252
01:36:50,238 --> 01:36:52,878
I'll see you tomorrow at 11:00.

1253
01:37:31,980 --> 01:37:35,250
Hey. I came to make sure you guys win.

1254
01:37:35,283 --> 01:37:39,293
[laughs] I even made a bet
with your friend, Ticky.

1255
01:37:42,991 --> 01:37:45,991
Knowing Ticky bet against us
improves our chances.

1256
01:37:47,595 --> 01:37:51,665
Did you really fill out an
application to work at the school?

1257
01:37:51,699 --> 01:37:53,199
Yeah.

1258
01:38:04,012 --> 01:38:06,212
Good luck today.

1259
01:38:06,248 --> 01:38:09,148
Thank you.

1260
01:38:12,687 --> 01:38:16,117
Andre and Ray Ray. What's up, Coach?

1261
01:38:16,158 --> 01:38:18,028
Why don't you bring everybody in?

1262
01:38:18,060 --> 01:38:20,700
Hey, y'all, bring it in. Bring it in!

1263
01:38:20,728 --> 01:38:23,098
Y'all, let's go.

1264
01:38:33,375 --> 01:38:37,445
I want you guys to take a good look
at yourselves today and feel proud.

1265
01:38:39,581 --> 01:38:42,051
You made it here. We're here.

1266
01:38:44,252 --> 01:38:46,392
What I've learned from you is that...

1267
01:38:46,421 --> 01:38:48,691
really, one of the most
important things in life...

1268
01:38:48,723 --> 01:38:52,033
is showing up.

1269
01:38:52,060 --> 01:38:55,700
I'm blown away
by your ability to show up...

1270
01:38:55,730 --> 01:38:59,170
through everything that's gone on.

1271
01:39:00,535 --> 01:39:03,705
The league never wanted you
to play this game.

1272
01:39:03,738 --> 01:39:06,608
But you showed up.

1273
01:39:06,641 --> 01:39:09,541
But, uh, we only have eight players,

1274
01:39:09,577 --> 01:39:12,307
so... God.

1275
01:39:12,347 --> 01:39:13,277
...we can't play.

1276
01:39:25,393 --> 01:39:28,433
He was my brother.

1277
01:39:28,463 --> 01:39:31,103
He loved to watch us play.

1278
01:39:31,666 --> 01:39:32,326
He's watching us right now.

1279
01:39:38,573 --> 01:39:40,983
We gon' play today.

1280
01:39:44,379 --> 01:39:45,509
Here you go, Kofi.

1281
01:39:50,785 --> 01:39:53,485
