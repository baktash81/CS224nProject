Hey this is Luke

4
00:00:35,398 --> 00:00:36,398
this is my film

5
00:00:36,571 --> 00:00:37,571
let me ask you a couple of questions

6
00:00:37,699 --> 00:00:39,407
why do you dance?

7
00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:40,339
because it’s like

8
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:42,298
breathing, it’s like walking to me

9
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,668
I’m not pretending, and
when I dance, I don’t pretend

10
00:00:44,734 --> 00:00:47,769
I’m more myself when I dance
then any other moment in the day

11
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:50,812
I dance to become someone else

12
00:00:50,943 --> 00:00:53,872
there is a so many things in this
world want to push down on you

13
00:00:54,436 --> 00:00:56,000
but when you dance you're free

14
00:00:56,001 --> 00:00:57,616
we started dancing at the age of 7

15
00:00:58,969 --> 00:01:00,305
in our house, in the living room

16
00:01:00,525 --> 00:01:03,600
just dancing dancing copy
ah copy Michael Jackson

17
00:01:03,326 --> 00:01:05,864
and I’m just like listening to
the music in the grocery store

18
00:01:06,234 --> 00:01:08,227
just like dancing to the
elvis and stuff like this

19
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:10,426
she is like.. contain
yourself! calm down

20
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:13,010
and I’m like, I can’t stop, I
have to do it, I have to do it

21
00:01:13,282 --> 00:01:14,746
after every bodies went to sleep I would

22
00:01:15,407 --> 00:01:17,598
open the garage and just practice

23
00:01:17,685 --> 00:01:19,093
that’s pretty much when I knew like

24
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:24,004
I love it, because I never detected so
much time and efforts to something like that

25
00:01:24,052 --> 00:01:26,482
it’s not like just jumping
around dance has vocabulary

26
00:01:27,032 --> 00:01:27,984
I’m from Argentina

27
00:01:29,264 --> 00:01:30,102
Miami
- Florida

28
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:32,606
there is a allot of gangs and violent

29
00:01:34,178 --> 00:01:34,959
my village was attacked

30
00:01:35,077 --> 00:01:36,761
my parent didn’t even
want me around anymore

31
00:01:36,936 --> 00:01:38,328
she actually kicked me out of the house

32
00:01:38,383 --> 00:01:38,869
I have to go

33
00:01:39,483 --> 00:01:40,004

34
00:01:40,179 --> 00:01:41,471

35
00:01:41,644 --> 00:01:44,130

don’t know what we'll doing right now

36

37
00:01:45,673 --> 00:01:47,328
I was sleeping with 15 dollars a week

38
00:01:48,504 --> 00:01:49,431

40
00:01:51,546 --> 00:01:53,334

00:31:27,322 --> 00:31:31,837
so I’ve been thinking about
your video from last night

292
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:33,611
Luke I think you should finish it

293
00:31:34,587 --> 00:31:35,838
and you should show it to people

294
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:40,247
yeah I don’t know about that I
mean clearly you love it, right?

295
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:43,233
look at you you've been
up all night and you like

298
00:32:02,762 --> 00:32:05,952
we should get to red hook you're right

299
00:32:30,978 --> 00:32:35,790
rea hook, are you ready?
pirates, you're ready?

300
00:32:36,521 --> 00:32:39,194
let’s do it

301
00:36:16,847 --> 00:36:18,520
and the winner is

302
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:23,414
the pirates

303
00:36:43,335 --> 00:36:43,790
no no no

304
00:36:44,019 --> 00:36:47,578
yeah yeah, no time for you
to be in front of the camera

305
00:36:47,751 --> 00:36:51,365
my good looking pirate yeah
do you want some make up baby?

306
00:36:54,513 --> 00:36:57,661
so, captain Luke give me the camera

307
00:37:06,859 --> 00:37:08,402
what do you love about dance?

308
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:13,627
I don’t know dance, music it’s
just, always been here for me I guess

309
00:37:17,538 --> 00:37:17,851
that it?

310
00:37:20,074 --> 00:37:20,691
what?

311
00:37:22,909 --> 00:37:24,348
I know you could do
better than that, c'mon

312
00:37:26,683 --> 00:37:30,732
my parents used to be dancers and they
started this place for people like them

313
00:37:31,863 --> 00:37:33,869
but they didn’t just want
to be a back up dancers

314
00:37:35,738 --> 00:37:38,905
you know, do their own
thing build their own respect

315
00:37:40,172 --> 00:37:42,706
I thought that was cool so I
wanted to carry on the tradition

316
00:37:43,033 --> 00:37:45,199
in my own way but for them you know

317
00:37:47,818 --> 00:37:50,550
so what is they think of you
turning this place into a mad house

318
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:55,455
they never get to see it

319
00:38:02,795 --> 00:38:03,614
I’m so sorry

320
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,975
no don’t be, it’s okay

321
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:09,174
so that’s why you so
devoted to this place?

322
00:38:10,272 --> 00:38:11,652
carrying on what your parents wanted

323
00:38:12,046 --> 00:38:12,883
family are family

324
00:38:13,971 --> 00:38:16,389
you know, the vault used to
be their life and now it’s mine

325
00:38:18,029 --> 00:38:20,112

for families sometimes

326
00:38:21,085 --> 00:38:22,123

327
00:38:23,931 --> 00:38:25,082

357
00:40:54,883 --> 00:41:00,052
okay, you got to stop complaining oh I’m sorry,
I just feel ridiculous holding this giant cup

358
00:41:00,784 --> 00:41:04,714
whoever said that it was okay to have
small, medium, large and then giant-enormous

359
00:41:05,734 --> 00:41:10,132
hey look; that’s you

360
00:41:10,309 --> 00:41:12,952
what you talking about? this
guy looks exactly like you

361
00:41:13,106 --> 00:41:13,842
no he doesn’t

362
00:41:13,843 --> 00:41:17,204
look he's got a camera popping out of his
head he's got the pretty little chin bones

363
00:41:17,204 --> 00:41:20,514
he does not look anything like me and
I will not ... to those controverters

364
00:41:21,065 --> 00:41:23,181
I’ve seen your works and you don’t ...

365
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,763
yeah but just for fun it’s
not something professional

366
00:41:26,763 --> 00:41:30,199
well what if the pirates
and the rivalry didn’t exist?

367
00:41:30,199 --> 00:41:33,118
wouldn’t you give your
film making a shot?

368
00:41:33,673 --> 00:41:35,673
that film academy sounds amazing

369
00:41:35,673 --> 00:41:37,053
yeah but it’s not an option

370
00:41:37,053 --> 00:41:38,975
so I don’t think about it

371
00:41:38,975 --> 00:41:41,122
the world jams are my main focus

372
00:41:32,122 --> 00:41:44,281
okay you should tell
me then how you do it?

373
00:41:44,281 --> 00:41:45,281

374
00:41:45,093 --> 00:41:46,975

375
00:41:48,177 --> 00:41:50,185
I don’t know, I just try to see
things that people don’t really see

376
00:41:52,393 --> 00:41:53,404

377
00:41:53,404 --> 00:41:56,204

383
00:44:02,251 --> 00:44:02,925

00:44:02,925 --> 00:44:05,348

00:44:06,717 --> 00:44:08,507
ready for it? 8 O’clock?

387
00:44:08,507 --> 00:44:11,472
it all goes down in china
town this is the house of gwai

388
00:44:11,473 --> 00:44:14,114
they're champion of Asia
so I hope you're prepared

389
00:44:14,114 --> 00:44:15,859
hey we've got a problem

390
00:44:15,859 --> 00:44:18,802
no problems man this is
round 2 you got to be there

391
00:44:18,802 --> 00:44:22,039
we can’t have any missing links so we
won’t be eliminated from the world jam

392
00:44:22,039 --> 00:44:24,876
I know, I have a test
on the same exact day

00:44:24,876 --> 00:44:28,096
I don’t if I can.. listen we need you

394
00:44:28,096 --> 00:44:29,923
do whatever you can to make it work

395
00:44:36,355 --> 00:44:39,852
sure I don’t need to remind
you how much this test counts

396
00:44:39,852 --> 00:44:43,278
this is worth 25% of your grade

397
00:44:43,278 --> 00:44:44,738
take your time

398
00:44:44,738 --> 00:44:46,377
you may begin

399
00:45:33,286 --> 00:45:35,232

00:47:14,354 --> 00:47:16,685

402
00:49:08,049 --> 00:49:09,659

403
00:49:09,731 --> 00:49:10,907

yo, hold up cut the music

406
00:49:22,246 --> 00:49:23,954
you guys need to see this

407
00:49:32,115 --> 00:49:34,704
what is this? it’s our entirely routine

408
00:49:34,705 --> 00:49:35,437
why its online?

409
00:49:35,438 --> 00:49:37,591
it cannot be they know our whole set

410
00:49:37,592 --> 00:49:39,579
what do you mean? who would
do that? Julian and the samurai

411
00:49:39,714 --> 00:49:42,660
how could they get our rehearsal
footage does everyone has their DVDs?

412
00:49:45,049 --> 00:49:47,416
they're just staling it alright we
just got to figure something else

413
00:49:49,018 --> 00:49:49,759
okay you see there?

414
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:52,915
if you could just let go on
that spin we can Laing this thing

415
00:49:52,915 --> 00:49:55,429
those guys may have our
tapes but that won’t stop us

416
00:49:55,429 --> 00:49:56,426
trust me

417
00:49:57,037 --> 00:49:58,653
Luke I don’t know

418
00:49:58,654 --> 00:50:00,676
maybe somebody else should do it

419
00:50:01,437 --> 00:50:03,427
if we pull this off
we'll kill on the stage

420
00:50:03,428 --> 00:50:04,890
Julian won’t even know what hit him

421
00:50:09,242 --> 00:50:10,708
whatever happened between you two?

422
00:50:11,514 --> 00:50:12,364
me and Julian?

423
00:50:12,994 --> 00:50:14,920
he used to be a pirate

424
00:50:14,921 --> 00:50:19,047
we used to be best friend back on the
days but as time were on I think he changed

425
00:50:19,047 --> 00:50:20,651
how do you mean he changed?

426
00:50:21,135 --> 00:50:22,732
we found out he had a gambling problem

427
00:50:22,732 --> 00:50:26,148
he run out in bad bets, so desperate
that he bets against his own house

428
00:50:26,148 --> 00:50:27,775
and threw the battle to win the bet

429
00:50:27,775 --> 00:50:29,315
he threw a battle to win a bet?

430
00:50:29,315 --> 00:50:32,353
the whole house was devastated
so we had to kick him out

431
00:50:32,353 --> 00:50:35,088
he is been trying to
take us down ever since

432
00:50:35,088 --> 00:50:39,086
the crazy thing is if we don’t win
the world jam he can actually do it

433
00:51:20,439 --> 00:51:23,927
hey, welcome home

434
00:51:23,927 --> 00:51:25,468
you lied to me

435
00:51:26,339 --> 00:51:28,686
you told me Luke kicked you
out because he was jealous

436
00:51:28,686 --> 00:51:30,725
but it wasn’t that, was it?

437
00:51:30,725 --> 00:51:32,796
you threw a battle for a bet!?

438
00:51:32,796 --> 00:51:35,521
Natalie, you have to don’t I
went in there for you Julian

439
00:51:35,521 --> 00:51:38,376
I can’t believe you stole
that DVD and put it online

440
00:51:38,376 --> 00:51:39,296
what you talking about?

441
00:51:39,296 --> 00:51:41,174
what kind of BS that
you said about me now

442
00:51:41,174 --> 00:51:42,639
Luke was jealous

443
00:51:42,636 --> 00:51:44,931
he want it to be the
leader so he kicked me out

444
00:51:44,931 --> 00:51:46,485
he used me and he kicked me out

445
00:51:52,443 --> 00:51:53,482
I’m sorry

446
00:51:54,978 --> 00:51:57,338
we have to stick together
Natalie you know that

447
00:51:49,838 --> 00:51:59,525
I don’t like to be lied too

448
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,471
I just want our house
to win the world jam

449
00:52:02,798 --> 00:52:03,765
okay

450
00:52:03,765 --> 00:52:06,989
we have too much in
this we work too hard

451
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:10,365
despite what mom and dad said doesn’t
always have to be about winning

452
00:52:10,365 --> 00:52:11,875
you start to sound like him

453
00:52:11,875 --> 00:52:14,271
you need to check your self and
remember whose side you're on

454
00:52:14,271 --> 00:52:15,547
freaking ridiculous

455
00:52:15,547 --> 00:52:18,549
you know Luke isn’t some monster Julian

456
00:52:18,549 --> 00:52:20,937
he is a good guy he takes care
of the people that he loves

457
00:52:20,937 --> 00:52:21,907
who you goanna believe?

458
00:52:21,907 --> 00:52:23,895
him or your family?

459
00:52:23,895 --> 00:52:25,277
you goanna talk to me about family?

460
00:52:25,277 --> 00:52:27,602
when Luke is not even related
to any of those dancers

461
00:52:27,602 --> 00:52:30,577
he would never lie
to them oh I’m a liar?

462
00:52:30,577 --> 00:52:32,434
what about you?

463
00:52:32,434 --> 00:52:37,125
how do you think your precious Luke is goanna feel
when he finds out that you have been playing him?

464
00:52:37,125 --> 00:52:39,059
actually now that I think of it

465
00:52:40,779 --> 00:52:42,018
you should come clean

466
00:52:42,018 --> 00:52:44,702
that might be just what I need to
throw a game off for world champ.

467
00:52:44,702 --> 00:52:47,724
thanks sis you really helped me

468
00:52:47,724 --> 00:52:52,650
I’m not putting a man on the
street over some stupid rivalry

469
00:52:55,262 --> 00:52:56,840
I will not be part of it

470
00:53:12,681 --> 00:53:15,584
Jacob, you scared me

471
00:53:15,584 --> 00:53:16,980
you don’t seem like a
girl that get easily scared

472
00:53:22,658 --> 00:53:24,273
tell Luke I’m sorry

473
00:53:29,619 --> 00:53:31,130
you have a choice you know

474
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:36,651
it’s not that easy

475
00:53:36,651 --> 00:53:39,964
the most important decisions
in life were never easy

476
00:53:56,867 --> 00:53:58,810
dance can reveal a lot about a person

477
00:53:58,810 --> 00:54:01,538
the way they move, the
way they learn new steps

478
00:54:01,538 --> 00:54:03,393
I mean if you were dancing for real

479
00:54:03,393 --> 00:54:05,698
it comes from the most
truthful parts of your self

480
00:54:05,698 --> 00:54:08,503
I dance to express how I feel inside

481
00:54:08,503 --> 00:54:13,339
whether its anger, happiness, loneliness

482
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:22,072
this is where I feel safe, is where
I belong this where my family is

483
00:54:20,358 --> 00:54:24,133
this place is very special, is our world

484
00:54:24,133 --> 00:54:27,622
finally, well I have some
place where I can be my self

485
00:54:27,622 --> 00:54:31,159
people said that you don’t
really choose your family we did

486
00:54:31,159 --> 00:54:33,409
if you want to be one
of us Luke will find you

487
00:55:18,751 --> 00:55:21,952
Luke why would she just leave like this?

488
00:55:21,952 --> 00:55:23,109
I don’t know

489
00:55:23,111 --> 00:55:25,896
but for the moment we got
bigger problem than that

490
00:55:27,163 --> 00:55:28,839
the bank put the house in the auction

491
00:55:28,839 --> 00:55:29,733
what?

492
00:55:29,733 --> 00:55:31,618
they're selling it

493
00:55:33,755 --> 00:55:35,231
hey look I’m goanna
deal with this alright

494
00:55:37,691 --> 00:55:39,933
what the hell wait? hey
Luke, how are ya? sit down

495
00:55:39,933 --> 00:55:41,095
I don’t want to sit down

496
00:55:41,789 --> 00:55:43,371
Luke, I understand
how hard this might be

497
00:55:43,371 --> 00:55:45,757
if you can just wait a few
days we'll have the money

498
00:55:45,757 --> 00:55:47,697
you're 5 month behind on your morgage

499
00:55:47,698 --> 00:55:51,973
unless you can catch up with your payments I’m
afraid there is nothing more I can do for you

500
00:55:51,973 --> 00:55:56,400
ware house is in prime property and the bank
is well aware what its goanna go for an auction

501
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:57,499
I need more times

502
00:55:57,499 --> 00:56:01,189
I see it can get them to suspend the
closure but don’t get your hopes up

503
00:56:01,189 --> 00:56:04,337
I can take your ware house today Luke

504
00:56:04,337 --> 00:56:07,010
I guess that never goanna
happen cause it’s not for sale

505
00:56:10,692 --> 00:56:12,141
look what I just got from Natalie

506
00:56:12,141 --> 00:56:14,181
wait what is it mean?

507
00:56:14,181 --> 00:56:17,213
I don’t know, but I’m goanna find out

508
00:56:21,379 --> 00:56:24,532

509
00:56:24,532 --> 00:56:28,433
I have a Halloween party I
mean I would but I can’t miss it

00:56:28,433 --> 00:56:30,758
college parties start late I

511
00:56:30,758 --> 00:56:33,101
I supposed to be Ashley Olsen man

512

Ashley Olsen? yeah, you know how
long to get straighten my hair

513
00:56:36,970 --> 00:56:38,365

00:56:40,264 --> 00:56:43,418

00:56:45,079 --> 00:56:45,949
alright, I got your back

516
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,144
it’s got to be another way

517
00:57:25,867 --> 00:57:28,488
and now the broken tango

518
00:57:31,426 --> 00:57:34,870

before school, during school and after

555
01:02:27,631 --> 01:02:32,782
so you've been lying to me and
dishing me for some secret life

556
01:02:33,584 --> 01:02:36,842
I mean you could have at least told me

557
01:02:36,851 --> 01:02:43,460
but I guess I’m not important
enough in your new cool life to know

558
01:02:44,917 --> 01:02:47,037
I should I’ve just told you

559
01:02:47,037 --> 01:02:49,691

01:02:52,724 --> 01:02:54,660

I’m a good dancer but
moose you're a great dancer

615
01:11:40,491 --> 01:11:46,173
my parents give up everything so
you wouldn’t have to, I know.. I know

616
01:11:46,414 --> 01:11:47,717
we can figure this out

617
01:11:48,652 --> 01:11:49,454
together

618
01:11:59,867 --> 01:12:01,782

01:12:03,161 --> 01:12:03,991

the world jam to get the house back

623
01:12:13,943 --> 01:12:15,021
and you are out of your mind

624
01:12:15,021 --> 01:12:16,021

we have nobodies left but I’m here

626
01:12:21,648 --> 01:12:25,145
Luke, you're the only one that can get
everybody back together to save your house

627
01:12:25,145 --> 01:12:28,997
the pirates need your leadership,
that’s it they don’t need me

628
01:12:31,006 --> 01:12:32,268
you really don’t know what you've done!

629
01:12:32,268 --> 01:12:36,373
Luke, you gave these people a place so they can
live up their dreams and be what they really are

you want to know why

634
01:12:46,315 --> 01:12:49,050
I dance because dance
could change things

635
01:12:50,562 --> 01:12:52,049
one move

636
01:12:52,049 --> 01:12:54,840
can set a whole
generation free like Elvis

637
01:12:56,808 --> 01:12:59,835
one move can make you believe
like you're something more

638
01:13:05,009 --> 01:13:07,397
moose sit down before you
make a fool of both of us

639

it’s time to grow up

709
01:20:38,844 --> 01:20:40,709
the samurai will win in any cost

710
01:20:40,709 --> 01:20:42,623

711
01:20:44,812 --> 01:20:46,023

721
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:50,961
I’m leaving tomorrow

722
01:22:52,966 --> 01:22:54,908
I’m taking a train to California

723
01:22:54,908 --> 01:22:58,665

courage to do that without you

724
01:22:59,445 --> 01:23:07,840

floor with these guys

733
01:28:17,251 --> 01:28:21,191

739
01:28:40,784 --> 01:28:42,542

740
01:28:44,556 --> 01:28:45,867

741
01:28:48,705 --> 01:28:51,099
what happen to family?

742
01:28:53,049 --> 01:28:54,948

743
01:32:42,655 --> 01:32:49,268
but now it’s time for our judges to
decide whose going home with this 100,000 $

744
01:32:49,268 --> 01:32:52,130
judges; are you ready with the decision?

745
01:32:52,130 --> 01:32:58,177
whose flag you goanna raise? black & gold for
the samurai or red and black for the pirates

746
01:33:00,317 --> 01:33:02,056
pirates

747
01:33:04,751 --> 01:33:13,381
oh my god, the house of pirates are
the winner of the first annual world jam

748
01:33:14,203 --> 01:33:21,082
it’s over, 100,000 $
to the house of pirates

749
01:34:09,347 --> 01:34:13,299
you can go if you want to, I will take
care of everything until you get back

750
01:34:13,299 --> 01:34:16,995
you give us a chance to live our dreams

751
01:34:16,995 --> 01:34:21,755
and now it’s time for you
to go and live your dreams

752
01:34:41,990 --> 01:34:43,669
you know some famous guy once said

753
01:34:43,669 --> 01:34:47,324
to travel is better than to arrive

754
01:34:47,324 --> 01:34:50,386
and I was like, what?

755
01:34:50,386 --> 01:34:51,386
maybe because I used to think that there is only
one path to take to what you goanna be in life

756
01:34:56,882 --> 01:35:01,444
but if you choose that one path it
doesn’t mean you have to ban the other ones

757
01:35:01,444 --> 01:35:06,943
I realize that if I see what
happen along the way that counts

758
01:35:09,724 --> 01:35:16,095
to stumbles, no any falls and pressures

759
01:35:16,095 --> 01:35:21,384
it’s your journey not to destination

760
01:35:21,124 --> 01:35:28,849
you kind of, I guess, trust that the
future will work so fine like it suppose to

761
01:35:33,118 --> 01:35:35,328
