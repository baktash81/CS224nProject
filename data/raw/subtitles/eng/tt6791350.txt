00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:19,972
Sorry.

Do not say that to me.

You are. You're a bad dog.

31
00:07:06,431 --> 00:07:09,214

that's not cool.

he refuse to take it back.

36
00:07:17,907 --> 00:07:19,514
- I don't know.
- What are you going to do?

37
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:21,536
Me? He's your brother.

38
00:07:21,997 --> 00:07:24,141
It doesn't matter, he still
doesn't listen to me.

39
00:07:24,205 --> 00:07:27,091
Yeah, he has been pretty mopey
ever since Gamora died.

00:07:27,124 --> 00:07:28,325
She's not dead.

41
00:07:28,547 --> 00:07:31,117
She just doesn't remember
anything from the past few years.

42
00:07:31,144 --> 00:07:32,452
Nobody tells me nothing.

No, not like that.
Touch him with her powers.

47
00:07:40,911 --> 00:07:43,510
It is wrong to manipulate
the feelings of friends.

48

What about that time you made
me fall in love with my sock?

49

Well, that was funny.

50
00:07:47,445 --> 00:07:49,767
I guess it's back to one of us
touching him the other way.

51
00:07:49,804 --> 00:07:50,852

You're gonna be okay.

90
00:16:04,658 --> 00:16:06,088
A kill switch?

91
00:16:06,287 --> 00:16:07,337
A device.

92
00:16:07,511 --> 00:16:10,076
Set to destruct if anyone goes
poking around inside him.

93
00:16:10,101 --> 00:16:11,434
Or even if we use the med packs.

94
00:16:11,459 --> 00:16:13,065
Why would Rocket
have a kill switch?

95
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:17,724
Apparently someone considers him proprietary
technology and sent that golden lunatic to get him.

96
00:16:17,749 --> 00:16:19,746
So he'll die if we operate on him?

97
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:22,125
- And he'll die if we don't.
- There has to be some way to bypass it.

98
00:16:22,187 --> 00:16:24,769
It looks like there's a pass key
that could override the kill switch.

99
00:16:24,946 --> 00:16:27,213
What do we know about
where Rocket came from?

100
00:16:27,284 --> 00:16:28,172
He won't talk about it.

101
00:16:28,185 --> 00:16:31,020
Much of the tech was developed
by a company called OrgoCorp.

102
00:16:31,268 --> 00:16:32,823
And there's a code on all of it.

103
00:16:33,268 --> 00:16:35,625
89P13.

104
00:16:35,889 --> 00:16:37,887
He's got maybe 48 hours.

105
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:43,295
- Where are you going?
- OrgoCorp have to have records, right?

106
00:16:43,331 --> 00:16:46,268
Maybe they'll have a way for us to
override the kill switch and save Rocket.

107
00:16:46,293 --> 00:16:47,906
They won't just give us that information.

108
00:16:47,931 --> 00:16:49,498
Well, that's why we're gonna break in.

109
00:16:49,523 --> 00:16:51,521
And kill anyone who gets in our way!

110
00:16:51,546 --> 00:16:53,252
- Not kill anyone.
- Kill a few people.

111
00:16:53,277 --> 00:16:56,896
- Kill no people.
- Kill one guy, one stupid guy who no one loves.

112
00:16:56,921 --> 00:16:58,629
Now you're just making it sad.

113
00:16:58,654 --> 00:17:02,787
Kraglin, Cosmo, I need you to keep watch over
Knowhere till we're back. Couple of days tops.

00:17:02,924 --> 00:17:04,468

- Aye, comrade.

115
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:08,543
- Take back what you said that I'm a bad dog.
- Nope.

116
00:17:08,618 --> 00:17:11,340
I know you don't really
think I am a bad dog.

117
00:17:11,365 --> 00:17:13,548
- Can you please take it back?
- I will not.

119
00:17:15,894 --> 00:17:17,785

120
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:20,415

Maybe they can help us get in.

Yes, that's exactly why I want it now.

- Of course.
- Its brain.

00:20:14,633 --> 00:20:16,996
That is the only reason, sire.

157
00:20:17,855 --> 00:20:20,850
But are you really trusting
the Sovereign to retrieve it?

158
00:20:20,984 --> 00:20:22,295
They're merely a backup.

00:21:52,444 --> 00:21:57,733
Three, two, one.

179
00:22:03,532 --> 00:22:05,060
- Peter.
- What?

180
00:22:05,142 --> 00:22:08,918
You had family on Earth. And you
never wanted to go back to see them?

181
00:22:09,838 --> 00:22:12,739
You're my sister. That's all
the family I want or need.

182
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:15,891
Besides, it's really just my grandpa,
okay? He's a pretty hard guy.

183
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:20,016
- Still, don't you think he...
- What?

184
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:23,757
You were abducted by Ravagers
the same day he lost his daughter.

185
00:22:23,782 --> 00:22:27,853
Oh yeah, he was upset. My mom died, he screamed
in my face, he pushed me out of the room!

186
00:22:27,878 --> 00:22:30,258
He was probably just trying to protect you.

187
00:22:30,388 --> 00:22:32,043
- What are you talking about?
- What?

188
00:22:32,068 --> 00:22:34,300
I'm talking about the people in my life who died,
you're talking about this?

189
00:22:34,325 --> 00:22:35,399
Second shield, set.

190
00:22:35,424 --> 00:22:38,357
Three, two, one.

191
00:22:42,955 --> 00:22:46,824
I'm only saying you've never
even gone to see if he's okay.

192
00:22:46,849 --> 00:22:48,314
He could still be alive.

193
00:22:48,339 --> 00:22:52,200
My grandpa? He'd be like, 90-
something years old.

194
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,823
So he could still be alive.

195
00:22:53,848 --> 00:22:55,846
People on Earth die
when they're like 50.

196
00:22:55,963 --> 00:22:57,468
They die when they're 50?

197
00:22:57,493 --> 00:22:59,072
I don't know. Something like that.

198
00:22:59,097 --> 00:23:00,855
What's even the
point of being born?

199
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,103
Exactly.

200
00:23:02,201 --> 00:23:04,199
Are you about to die?

201
00:23:05,664 --> 00:23:07,440
I'm not 50!

202
00:23:08,883 --> 00:23:12,130
The point is, I wasn't talking
about any of this.

203
00:23:13,994 --> 00:23:15,142
Third shield, set.

204
00:23:15,167 --> 00:23:18,591
Three, two, one.

205
00:23:18,748 --> 00:23:22,111
Well, not everything is about
what you are talking about.

206
00:23:22,136 --> 00:23:27,183
And I'm only saying you are upset because so
many of the people you cared about have left you.

207
00:23:27,243 --> 00:23:29,240
But you also left someone.

208
00:23:29,974 --> 00:23:31,825
And maybe I wanted a zargnut.

209
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,128
It's too late. They're all gone.

210
00:23:47,111 --> 00:23:48,541
Why didn't we go through?

211
00:23:51,778 --> 00:23:54,448
We did. It's not the shield.

212
00:23:58,395 --> 00:23:59,887
Oh, hell.

213
00:24:03,467 --> 00:24:04,944
Ravagers.

214
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:08,736
Hey guys, you're about to be
boarded by the United Ravagers.

215
00:24:08,761 --> 00:24:13,785
You can surrender and turn over any stuff
worth anything and live. Or you can die.

216
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:15,549
It's up to you.

217
00:24:30,766 --> 00:24:32,645
Drax, no, no, no! Drax!

218
00:24:32,691 --> 00:24:34,841
Guys, it's me. Peter Quill.
I'm one of you, remember?

219
00:24:34,866 --> 00:24:36,004
Hold on!

220
00:24:36,107 --> 00:24:38,187
- We have an appointment.
- We have an appointment.

221
00:24:38,248 --> 00:24:39,623
- With who?
- With Gamora.

222
00:24:39,647 --> 00:24:41,839
With Gamora.
What?

223
00:24:42,015 --> 00:24:43,548
You're early.

224
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,200
- (grunt)
- (grunt)

225
00:25:00,359 --> 00:25:01,394
What are these?

226
00:25:01,419 --> 00:25:03,417
OrgoCorp uniforms.

227
00:25:04,025 --> 00:25:08,752
You have to wear these to move through
the Orgo without attracting attention.

228
00:25:09,099 --> 00:25:10,677
This isn't my color.

229
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:15,138
What did you say?

230
00:25:15,163 --> 00:25:17,160
It clashes with my eyes.

231
00:25:21,427 --> 00:25:22,733
Put it on!

232
00:25:24,086 --> 00:25:27,918
Nebula, why would you not tell me that
you've been in contact with Gamora?

233
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:29,463
Because I didn't want
you to get freaked out.

234
00:25:29,488 --> 00:25:31,851
- Freaked out how?!
- Like that.

235
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,292
Let me in there, I don't want to be trapped
out here.

236
00:25:35,796 --> 00:25:38,039
Gamora, we're grateful for your help.

237
00:25:38,064 --> 00:25:40,169
I'm not doing this out of
the kindness of my heart.

238
00:25:40,949 --> 00:25:43,852
I'm doing this for the hundred
thousand units my sister promised.

239
00:25:45,174 --> 00:25:46,654
So you're a Ravager now?

240
00:25:47,593 --> 00:25:48,558
Put on the uniform.

241
00:25:48,583 --> 00:25:50,580
Never pictured you as the Ravager type.

242
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:52,998
Who are you again?

243
00:25:53,132 --> 00:25:54,325
Oh, man...

244
00:25:54,396 --> 00:26:00,380
OrgoCorp is in possession of some of the
most advanced cybergenetic IP in the galaxy.

245
00:26:00,605 --> 00:26:05,562
So they're heavily guarded
by the deadly Orgosentries.

246
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:09,252
Now I know you don't have
documentation to dock.

247
00:26:09,335 --> 00:26:11,710
So you're gonna have to
get in there on your own.

248
00:26:12,043 --> 00:26:16,760
Once in, Gamora is gonna
lead you to the records.

249
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:21,012
Where maybe you can find the
pass key to override the kill switch.

250
00:26:21,379 --> 00:26:23,696
And help you save the hedgehog.

251
00:26:24,096 --> 00:26:25,850
But if you get into trouble,

252
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:29,744
we will not be able
to bail you out.

253
00:26:46,406 --> 00:26:47,598
Yes.

254
00:26:48,421 --> 00:26:49,666
Yes, of course.

255
00:26:53,673 --> 00:26:55,346
Its functioning has skyrocketed.

256
00:26:59,026 --> 00:27:01,878
That's correct, P13. Very good.

257
00:27:07,903 --> 00:27:09,673
That's the new world.

258
00:27:09,889 --> 00:27:11,344
Counter-Earth.

259
00:27:11,808 --> 00:27:14,379
Where the experiments will
go once they're ready.

260
00:27:14,545 --> 00:27:17,032
- It blue.
- That's the sky.

261
00:27:17,144 --> 00:27:18,335
Sky.

262
00:27:21,777 --> 00:27:23,993
- Rocket.
- Yes, it is.

263
00:27:25,006 --> 00:27:26,809
What sounds?

264
00:27:28,268 --> 00:27:29,947
That's music.

265
00:27:30,205 --> 00:27:32,802
- We like it?
- We do.

266
00:27:33,099 --> 00:27:36,861
This recording is over 5,000 years old.

267
00:27:37,676 --> 00:27:40,296
(speaks foreign language)

268
00:27:42,104 --> 00:27:43,883
Which translated, is...

269
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:47,371
Be not as you are,
but as you should be.

270
00:27:47,862 --> 00:27:49,541
It's our sacred mission

271
00:27:49,713 --> 00:27:52,863
to take the cacophony
of sounds around us

272
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:55,979
and turn it into a song.

273
00:27:57,778 --> 00:28:03,056
To take an imperfect clump of
biological matter such as you,

274
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:07,754
and transform it into something...
perfect.

275
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:13,700
And we're halfway there, aren't we?

276
00:28:16,902 --> 00:28:18,899
Come with me, P13.

277
00:28:19,233 --> 00:28:21,035
I'd like to show you something.

278
00:28:25,448 --> 00:28:27,445
We have but a single quest...

279
00:28:27,749 --> 00:28:29,868
To create the perfect species,

280
00:28:30,395 --> 00:28:32,392
and the perfect society.

281
00:28:32,645 --> 00:28:35,018
You, P13,

282
00:28:35,253 --> 00:28:37,251
are part of batch 89.

283
00:28:37,721 --> 00:28:39,943
But here, with batch 90,

284
00:28:40,573 --> 00:28:43,516
I've developed a process
by which I can guide

285
00:28:43,588 --> 00:28:51,079
any organism through millions of years of
programmed evolutionary changes, in a moment.

286
00:29:21,813 --> 00:29:23,150
See now...

287
00:29:23,761 --> 00:29:25,678
There's the rub.

288
00:29:26,661 --> 00:29:29,814
For some reason, these specimens

289
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:35,300
are also over-producing the legobeta
microsamino protein in their systems.

290
00:29:35,325 --> 00:29:37,016
Causing them to be, well...

291
00:29:37,041 --> 00:29:39,420
Violent. We don't like it.

292
00:29:39,445 --> 00:29:43,041
A utopia can't have its denizens
murdering one another, can it?

293
00:29:43,612 --> 00:29:44,819
They can'ts.

294
00:29:45,677 --> 00:29:47,832
- Can't.
- Can't.

295
00:29:48,042 --> 00:29:49,049
Theel.

296
00:29:53,185 --> 00:29:56,462
They're programmed to be peaceful, like you.

297
00:29:56,619 --> 00:29:59,614
But for some reason, it's not catching.

298
00:30:00,442 --> 00:30:02,190
Heptonic filters.

299
00:30:02,851 --> 00:30:03,670
What?

300
00:30:03,695 --> 00:30:07,824
They suppresaliding the glycusolided
saltses.

301
00:30:08,121 --> 00:30:09,892
And then, boop, boop, boop...

302
00:30:09,917 --> 00:30:12,085
Absisting residual deformant.

303
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:14,722
And then, they, make, um...

304
00:30:15,446 --> 00:30:18,835
- What do you say?
- The legobeta microsamino proteins.

305
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,450
Yeah, thems.

306
00:30:20,475 --> 00:30:23,150
And then, angry turtleses.

307
00:30:26,751 --> 00:30:27,751
Huh.

308
00:30:29,835 --> 00:30:33,055
♪ In The Meantime - Spacehog ♪

309
00:31:11,676 --> 00:31:14,469
There, that's the decompression chamber.

310
00:31:14,942 --> 00:31:16,177
Lock in.

311
00:31:26,341 --> 00:31:27,358
Go.

312
00:31:56,965 --> 00:31:59,407
Activate gravity boots and gloves.

313
00:32:07,304 --> 00:32:09,398
Nebula, go.

314
00:32:44,697 --> 00:32:46,418
So you really don't remember anything?

315
00:32:46,811 --> 00:32:47,829
Like what?

316
00:32:48,866 --> 00:32:51,279
- About your time with us.
- No.

317
00:32:52,433 --> 00:32:55,172
- Well, we were...
- We weren't anything.

318
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:59,886
- You and me...
- That person was some alternate future version of me.

319
00:33:01,298 --> 00:33:02,383
Wasn't me.

320
00:33:03,987 --> 00:33:05,114
We loved each other.

321
00:33:07,399 --> 00:33:08,665
I don't think so.

322
00:33:10,842 --> 00:33:12,714
I know you don't remember any of it...

323
00:33:15,196 --> 00:33:16,764
but you were everything to me.

324
00:33:19,492 --> 00:33:21,040
And I miss you.

325
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:23,873
So much.

326
00:33:25,223 --> 00:33:26,308
And maybe...

327
00:33:27,222 --> 00:33:29,429
Maybe if you open yourself up to it...

328
00:33:31,797 --> 00:33:34,182
- There's a possibility...
- I don't think so, Quinn.

329
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,576
- Quill.
- Quill.

330
00:33:39,557 --> 00:33:40,736
I don't think so.

331
00:33:41,063 --> 00:33:42,218
But what I'm trying to say...

332
00:33:42,243 --> 00:33:44,746
Peter, you know this
is an open line, right?

333
00:33:44,771 --> 00:33:47,266
- What?
- We're listening to everything you're saying.

334
00:33:47,353 --> 00:33:49,491
And it is painful.

335
00:33:49,516 --> 00:33:50,645
And you're just telling me now?

336
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:52,346
We were hoping it
would stop on its own.

337
00:33:52,371 --> 00:33:53,533
But I switched it over to private.

338
00:33:53,558 --> 00:33:54,968
What color button did you push?

339
00:33:54,993 --> 00:33:56,334
Blue. For the blue suit.

340
00:33:56,359 --> 00:33:59,011
- Oh, no.
- Blue is the open line for everyone.

341
00:33:59,035 --> 00:34:00,259
Orange is for blue.

342
00:34:00,304 --> 00:34:02,195
- What?
- Black is for orange.

343
00:34:02,222 --> 00:34:04,692
Yellow is for green.
Green is for red.

344
00:34:04,717 --> 00:34:05,971
And red is for yellow.

345
00:34:05,996 --> 00:34:07,570
No, yellow is for yellow.

346
00:34:07,595 --> 00:34:09,272
Green is for red.
Red is for green.

347
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:11,129
- I don't think so.
- Try it, then.

348
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:14,627
Hello!

349
00:34:15,771 --> 00:34:18,706
- You were right.
- How the hell am I supposed to know all of that!?

350
00:34:18,731 --> 00:34:20,064
Seems intuitive.

351
00:34:20,541 --> 00:34:22,592
Can we get back to saving our friend?

352
00:34:23,586 --> 00:34:25,583
Get that jammer ready
to change the shield.

353
00:35:01,106 --> 00:35:01,932
Guys?

354
00:35:01,957 --> 00:35:06,106
I mean, you wanna talk about a sweet ride,
the acceleration will crush your spine.

355
00:35:06,131 --> 00:35:09,213
It's got that brand new Fusilux core.
You know what I'm talking about?

356
00:35:09,238 --> 00:35:11,655
- Oh, yeah.
- Really? Because I just made that up.

357
00:35:12,298 --> 00:35:13,746
Oh, well, I thought you
said something else.

358
00:35:14,586 --> 00:35:15,877
Master Karja.

359
00:35:17,621 --> 00:35:19,619
- No, you didn't.
- I did... I did.

360
00:35:19,903 --> 00:35:23,493
Master Karja, there appears to be a physical
breach in the white wing somewhere.

361
00:35:23,518 --> 00:35:24,421
Could it be a glitch?

362
00:35:24,446 --> 00:35:25,530
Maybe?

363
00:35:31,647 --> 00:35:33,091
I'm accessing the eye.

364
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:34,612
I'll see if I can locate it.

365
00:36:06,721 --> 00:36:10,386
There's some sort of anomaly in the decompression
chamber. Best you check it out, Master.

366
00:36:10,419 --> 00:36:11,728
On it.

367
00:36:12,549 --> 00:36:13,593
Hurry.

368
00:36:25,655 --> 00:36:26,727
Where do we put these?

369
00:36:28,373 --> 00:36:31,199
Here! Hide them in this
locker until we leave.

370
00:36:38,285 --> 00:36:39,423
Hurry.

371
00:36:55,953 --> 00:36:57,950
What the hell was that, guys?

372
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:01,798
What, are you kidding me?

373
00:37:02,126 --> 00:37:05,885
- What?
- A neutral quark just hit the satellite.

374
00:37:06,347 --> 00:37:12,052
It's burning a hole thru the wall. You geniuses, you
just throw the door open without any
proper precautionary procedure?

375
00:37:12,077 --> 00:37:13,558
What procedure, bro?

376
00:37:13,583 --> 00:37:17,420
Oh, you want us to read the
manual for you too, bros?

377
00:37:17,445 --> 00:37:19,443
You could have killed everyone in the wing.

378
00:37:19,548 --> 00:37:21,546
Exactly, you idiots!

379
00:37:22,089 --> 00:37:23,436
I'm angry, too.

380
00:37:23,461 --> 00:37:24,490
Oh, no.

381
00:37:24,515 --> 00:37:29,040
I mean, can't you see these authentic mechanic
uniforms that we're wearing on our bodies?

382
00:37:29,147 --> 00:37:31,567
That blend in with some of our
skin tones better than others?

383
00:37:31,709 --> 00:37:35,586
Excuse my friend. He is the
boss' nephew. He's a little...

384
00:37:38,261 --> 00:37:40,587
Oh...
Oh.

385
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:44,044
Yeah, I...
I got one of those too.

386
00:37:44,331 --> 00:37:47,993
I mean, this one? This one, I love.
I'm so proud that you...

387
00:37:48,134 --> 00:37:49,726
You're doing great.
So proud of you.

388
00:37:49,781 --> 00:37:51,778
But, uh, this one...
I just...

389
00:37:58,326 --> 00:38:00,875
Everything he does drives me crazy.

390
00:38:01,159 --> 00:38:03,157
- I thought you said something else.
- Shut up.

391
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:05,354
I swear I'm gonna throttle him.

392
00:38:05,379 --> 00:38:07,211
I'm gonna go to jail for murder.
I am.

393
00:38:07,715 --> 00:38:09,053
How did you guys get here so fast?

394
00:38:09,341 --> 00:38:13,251
Uh, to be honest with you, we just happened
in before it burned all the way through, thankfully.

395
00:38:13,727 --> 00:38:15,202
Ah. Good thing you were here.

396
00:38:15,388 --> 00:38:17,386
Alright guys, wrap it up.

397
00:38:17,411 --> 00:38:19,409
Looks like we're all clear here.

398
00:38:23,796 --> 00:38:25,464
Our spacesuits!

399
00:38:28,203 --> 00:38:31,005
Ahh, you threw them in the contamination
bin.

400
00:38:31,036 --> 00:38:33,643
It expels stuff into space the
moment you shut the door.

401
00:38:33,668 --> 00:38:36,679
That would have been helpful
information three minutes ago!

402
00:38:36,704 --> 00:38:38,949
Dammit, Mantis, why don't you ever think?

403
00:38:38,974 --> 00:38:40,650
Are we pretending
to be angry again?

404
00:38:40,999 --> 00:38:42,305
Mantis, you asshole!

405
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:44,716
Guys, just focus for two seconds.

406
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:47,158
We'll find another way
out of here. Right now...

407
00:38:47,331 --> 00:38:48,953
We need to save Rocket's life.

408
00:38:51,535 --> 00:38:54,198
Nebula, Quinn and I will get to
the records and get the pass key.

409
00:38:54,501 --> 00:38:59,059
Bug and Doofus, access the spaceport thru the
elevator so Tree can land and get us out of here.

410
00:39:00,027 --> 00:39:02,024
- Oh! apologies.
- No problem.

411
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:04,575
Go.

412
00:39:18,035 --> 00:39:21,774
It's not my fault I don't know something
if no one ever tells me.

413
00:39:21,908 --> 00:39:23,421
I didn't even want to come here.

414
00:39:23,446 --> 00:39:24,677
I'm gonna need to see your...

415
00:39:24,702 --> 00:39:28,415
You're hopelessly in love... with him.

416
00:39:28,656 --> 00:39:30,039
Oh, no...

417
00:39:30,844 --> 00:39:32,964
- Hey.
- Hey.

418
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:35,920
How are you doing today?

419
00:39:36,486 --> 00:39:37,771
I'm alright.

420
00:39:40,442 --> 00:39:42,625
What...what was your name again?

421
00:39:42,968 --> 00:39:44,358
Drax the Destroyer.

422
00:39:44,624 --> 00:39:47,922
Oh! That is such a lovely name.

423
00:39:48,753 --> 00:39:49,968
I'll get the door for you.

424
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:54,611
- I'll be here when you come back out, okay?
- Sure.

425
00:39:56,121 --> 00:39:57,678
Every single time.

426
00:39:59,439 --> 00:40:01,306
My name is Bletelsnort!

427
00:40:02,125 --> 00:40:04,709
(public address announcer)
Welcome to OrgoCorp headquarters.

428
00:40:05,155 --> 00:40:12,129
For over 300 years OrgoCorp has been producing cybernetic
implants and genetic upgrades across the universe.

429
00:40:12,154 --> 00:40:15,524
Under the watchful eye
of the High Evolutionary.

430
00:40:17,155 --> 00:40:20,058
That warning we got today, don't
those two match the description?

431
00:40:20,786 --> 00:40:22,784
Attention all Orgosentries.

432
00:40:24,675 --> 00:40:26,800
That manager should
have access to the records.

433
00:40:28,029 --> 00:40:30,405
If the pass key is here,
she can get it for us.

434
00:40:31,097 --> 00:40:32,145
All right.

435
00:40:32,494 --> 00:40:34,492
- I'll handle this one.
- How?

436
00:40:34,775 --> 00:40:36,772
Pure Star-Lord charm.

437
00:40:37,225 --> 00:40:39,933
I'm excited for you that you get to see
this again for the first time.

438
00:40:44,968 --> 00:40:45,968
Ahem.

439
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:49,228
Hi, Yura.

440
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:51,388
- Ura.
- Oh, Ura.

441
00:40:51,413 --> 00:40:54,307
- Hi.
- Hi, my name is Patrick Swayze.

442
00:40:54,896 --> 00:40:57,436
I've been noticing you
for quite a while.

443
00:40:57,461 --> 00:41:01,338
And the way that you smile to yourself,
when you think nobody is looking,

444
00:41:01,362 --> 00:41:03,790
it makes my everyday a bit brighter.

445
00:41:03,852 --> 00:41:07,324
We need your hand, and it's your choice
whether it's on your body, or not!

446
00:41:07,356 --> 00:41:08,674
What are you doing?

447
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:10,188
She was never gonna fall for that.

448
00:41:10,213 --> 00:41:11,639
She was totally into me, man.

449
00:41:11,664 --> 00:41:13,317
I kinda thought you
were a douchebag.

450
00:41:13,342 --> 00:41:14,253
Oh, come on.

451
00:41:14,278 --> 00:41:15,455
- We need a file.
- What file?

452
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,898
89P13. Could that be something?

453
00:41:17,923 --> 00:41:20,887
- No.
- Then your use to us is over.

454
00:41:20,912 --> 00:41:21,869
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait!

455
00:41:21,894 --> 00:41:23,602
Sounds like a species tag.

456
00:41:24,611 --> 00:41:25,865
Show us!

457
00:41:28,751 --> 00:41:33,333
(announcer) All of our research supports the
High Evolutionary's altruistic objective

458
00:41:33,358 --> 00:41:36,213
of creating a utopian society.

459
00:41:36,218 --> 00:41:38,215
That must be the spaceport.

460
00:41:43,461 --> 00:41:45,194
Whoa.

461
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,715
What is all this?

462
00:41:47,063 --> 00:41:50,477
Species patented over the
years using OrgoCorp tech.

463
00:41:50,616 --> 00:41:54,777
Every species OrgoCorp has created
has its own individual file.

464
00:41:55,165 --> 00:41:58,529
I am so sorry about this. Listen to me,
this is not the kinda thing we do.

465
00:41:58,554 --> 00:42:01,020
Oh, please, stop it
with the subtle jabs!

466
00:42:01,044 --> 00:42:02,455
Old you would've never done this.

467
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,702
You had a purpose higher than
yourself, the calling to help people.

468
00:42:04,727 --> 00:42:06,725
That's why you left Thanos
and formed the Guardians.

469
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:10,437
Except I didn't form the Guardians
and I barely left Thanos.

470
00:42:10,698 --> 00:42:13,661
Whoever it was that
you were in love with,

471
00:42:14,654 --> 00:42:16,072
it wasn't me.

472
00:42:16,407 --> 00:42:17,859
It sounds more like her.

473
00:42:17,884 --> 00:42:18,819
- Her?
- What?

474
00:42:18,844 --> 00:42:22,323
- That's ridiculous...
- Do not bring me into this.
- Don't even.

475
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:28,250
- Knock it off!
- What?

476
00:42:28,275 --> 00:42:30,996
Don't look at me like a lost puppy
needing a soft place to lie down!

477
00:42:31,021 --> 00:42:32,705
I didn't say anything.

478
00:42:36,593 --> 00:42:38,590
I just never noticed how
black your eyes were.

479
00:42:40,998 --> 00:42:43,631
They were replaced by my father

480
00:42:44,024 --> 00:42:45,753
as a method of torture.

481
00:42:45,778 --> 00:42:48,548
He...he picked a pretty set.

482
00:42:50,538 --> 00:42:51,589
There.

483
00:42:52,504 --> 00:42:55,148
That's the file for 89P13.

484
00:42:57,126 --> 00:42:58,646
Heads up, heads up!

485
00:43:00,043 --> 00:43:01,043
Ugh!

486
00:43:22,226 --> 00:43:23,524
Oh, no.

487
00:43:24,993 --> 00:43:26,091
Walk!

488
00:43:27,954 --> 00:43:29,735
Run, run.

489
00:43:35,662 --> 00:43:37,039
Stand down!

490
00:43:37,594 --> 00:43:39,833
Drax, we should make a run for it.

491
00:43:39,866 --> 00:43:41,307
- Or we could fight.
- Run.

492
00:43:41,322 --> 00:43:42,688
- Fight.
- Run!

493
00:43:42,697 --> 00:43:45,333
- Fight!
- Take 'em!

494
00:43:49,665 --> 00:43:51,000
What are we going to do?

495
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:54,003
- I got a plan.
- What is it?

496
00:43:54,028 --> 00:43:55,135
All of you, come with---

497
00:43:56,010 --> 00:44:00,074
Everybody, lower your weapons or
I blow this woman's brain out!

498
00:44:00,099 --> 00:44:01,408
That's the plan?

499
00:44:02,166 --> 00:44:04,558
- You're a kitty cat.
- Meow!

500
00:44:06,946 --> 00:44:08,944
You feel like dancing.

501
00:44:10,597 --> 00:44:11,834
Violent rage.

502
00:44:17,893 --> 00:44:19,494
Lower your weapons!

503
00:44:23,165 --> 00:44:26,018
Now kill that one that looks like a
carrot to show we mean business.

504
00:44:26,886 --> 00:44:29,022
God! Past Gamora's just mean!

505
00:44:29,047 --> 00:44:31,972
She was always like that,
and yet I was the bad guy.

506
00:44:31,996 --> 00:44:33,994
We are not killing anyone!

507
00:44:34,051 --> 00:44:35,304
Back off!

508
00:44:37,544 --> 00:44:40,212
Groot, bring the Bowie to us. Now!

509
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:54,126
- I'm so sorry about this, Ura.
- Oh, please.

510
00:44:54,195 --> 00:44:57,660
We're here to save the
life of our friend. That is all.

511
00:44:58,816 --> 00:45:01,484
We paid her to help
us get in and get out.

512
00:45:01,509 --> 00:45:04,301
You'd think that'd mean, "oh, I'm gonna help you do
it in a way that no one knows it's happening."

513
00:45:04,326 --> 00:45:07,696
But no. What she means is I'm gonna
shoot people. Threaten people's lives.

514
00:45:07,721 --> 00:45:09,241
Shut up!

515
00:45:09,712 --> 00:45:12,909
And I know you're probably
asking "why would I trust her?" Well...

516
00:45:13,036 --> 00:45:14,430
That's a good question.

517
00:45:14,655 --> 00:45:16,217
The answer is...

518
00:45:16,582 --> 00:45:18,043
We used to be in love.

519
00:45:18,096 --> 00:45:21,999
Yeah, she was my girlfriend. Only she
doesn't remember it because it wasn't her.

520
00:45:22,109 --> 00:45:26,486
Because her dad threw her off a magic cliff and she died.
And then I lost my temper and nearly destroyed half the universe.

521
00:45:27,064 --> 00:45:30,019
Then she came back.
Out of the past. There she is.

522
00:45:30,486 --> 00:45:34,390
Everyone else who died in the past stayed dead. Not
her. Why? Was it the magic cliff? I don't know.

523
00:45:34,708 --> 00:45:37,028
I'm not some freakin'
Infinity Stone scientist.

524
00:45:38,457 --> 00:45:41,823
Just some dumbass Earth dude
who met a girl, fell in love.

525
00:45:42,193 --> 00:45:43,958
That girl died,

526
00:45:44,036 --> 00:45:46,298
and then came
back a total dick.

527
00:45:48,857 --> 00:45:51,488
You left out some important
information, but...

528
00:45:52,089 --> 00:45:53,751
That is the gist of it.

529
00:46:00,377 --> 00:46:01,593
Get to the security helm.

530
00:46:01,618 --> 00:46:02,857
Okay!

531
00:46:11,777 --> 00:46:14,557
Everybody down on the floor
or we blow your brains out.

532
00:46:14,582 --> 00:46:16,711
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
We don't want any---

533
00:46:17,710 --> 00:46:18,710
Oh my god.

534
00:46:19,076 --> 00:46:21,729
Come on! Would you please
stop doing that?

535
00:46:28,543 --> 00:46:32,143
♪ Reasons - Earth, Wind and Fire ♪

536
00:46:47,105 --> 00:46:49,603
- Ah ha ha ha!
- Hey!

537
00:47:05,077 --> 00:47:06,096
Run.

538
00:47:37,006 --> 00:47:38,848
Drax!

539
00:47:41,077 --> 00:47:44,327
Get on the ground, and
show me your hands now.

540
00:47:53,212 --> 00:47:54,330
Ura...

541
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:58,646
Please listen to me. We need
to get out of here with this.

542
00:47:58,786 --> 00:48:00,425
To save my best friend's life.

543
00:48:00,871 --> 00:48:04,818
If you could get us into the system of those
sentries out there, they are good people, like you...

544
00:48:05,081 --> 00:48:06,215
I'm certain of it.

545
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:08,283
And if I just had an
opportunity to speak to them...

546
00:48:08,309 --> 00:48:10,896
They're corporate shills, you idiot.
They're not gonna listen to you.

547
00:48:10,921 --> 00:48:13,450
They will listen if I speak
to them from my heart.

548
00:48:14,728 --> 00:48:15,899
Ura...

549
00:48:16,577 --> 00:48:17,702
please.

550
00:48:27,173 --> 00:48:28,283
Hey!

551
00:48:31,407 --> 00:48:33,129
Come out now!

552
00:48:33,736 --> 00:48:35,144
Damn it!

553
00:48:37,514 --> 00:48:38,536
Stop!

554
00:48:41,988 --> 00:48:44,366
You are in.

555
00:48:44,893 --> 00:48:47,257
- Tell them your truce---
- Yeah, I'm not that big of an idiot.

556
00:48:47,357 --> 00:48:49,095
I just needed to get
into the system.

557
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:52,220
Move it.

558
00:49:02,981 --> 00:49:04,248
Told you she was into me.

559
00:49:26,121 --> 00:49:27,420
I am Groot?

560
00:49:27,844 --> 00:49:30,369
Yeah. That looked cool.

561
00:49:39,771 --> 00:49:41,769
Is sky?

562
00:49:42,483 --> 00:49:44,024
No.

563
00:49:44,128 --> 00:49:47,231
That's not sky. That's a ceiling.

564
00:49:48,015 --> 00:49:51,445
Sire is making a
new world for all of us.

565
00:49:51,545 --> 00:49:53,380
And when we get there,

566
00:49:53,619 --> 00:49:55,315
there will be sky,

567
00:49:55,584 --> 00:49:57,581
and it will be beautiful.

568
00:49:57,632 --> 00:49:59,342
And forever.

569
00:49:59,501 --> 00:50:01,441
- Wow.
- Wow.

570
00:50:01,543 --> 00:50:02,543
Whoa.

571
00:50:03,956 --> 00:50:05,954
I have been thinking.

572
00:50:06,798 --> 00:50:07,910
About what?

573
00:50:07,948 --> 00:50:10,266
Oh, nothing in particular.

574
00:50:10,823 --> 00:50:14,255
But I thought, since you
guys are my closest friends,

575
00:50:14,345 --> 00:50:16,143
and my only friends,

576
00:50:16,426 --> 00:50:20,856
you might be interested in knowing
that I have been, thinking.

577
00:50:21,068 --> 00:50:22,490
That's cool.

578
00:50:23,125 --> 00:50:24,921
I've been thinking, too.

579
00:50:24,987 --> 00:50:27,621
About something more singular.

580
00:50:28,409 --> 00:50:30,782
When sire moves
us to the new world,

581
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:32,912
we're gonna need names.

582
00:50:33,747 --> 00:50:38,858
I mean, 89Q12...
Not really a name.

583
00:50:39,305 --> 00:50:40,825
So...

584
00:50:41,132 --> 00:50:43,954
I would like my name to be...

585
00:50:45,150 --> 00:50:46,201
Lylla.

586
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:48,246
Lylla.

587
00:50:48,558 --> 00:50:49,837
Lylla.

588
00:50:50,043 --> 00:50:51,499
Lylla.

589
00:50:51,710 --> 00:50:53,708
That's a pretty name, Lylla.

590
00:50:54,896 --> 00:50:56,314
Thank you.

591
00:50:57,206 --> 00:51:00,536
I think my name shall be Teefs.

592
00:51:01,397 --> 00:51:03,871
Because although
we all do have them,

593
00:51:04,192 --> 00:51:06,583
mine are definitely
the most prominent.

594
00:51:08,312 --> 00:51:10,204
- Teefs.
- Teefs.

595
00:51:10,229 --> 00:51:11,694
- Lylla.
- Teefs.

596
00:51:12,771 --> 00:51:14,629
Me be called Floor...

597
00:51:14,683 --> 00:51:17,516
Because me is lying on floor.

598
00:51:17,598 --> 00:51:20,840
You're lying on a floor,
so your name is Floor?

599
00:51:22,038 --> 00:51:23,388
Yes.

600
00:51:24,764 --> 00:51:25,870
Floor.

601
00:51:26,712 --> 00:51:28,179
What about you, friend?

602
00:51:31,523 --> 00:51:35,202
Someday, I'm gonna make
great machines that fly.

603
00:51:35,837 --> 00:51:38,917
And me and my friends are
gonna go flying together.

604
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:42,475
Into the forever
and beautiful sky.

605
00:51:43,068 --> 00:51:46,923
Lylla, and Teefs, and Floor...

606
00:51:47,608 --> 00:51:48,780
And me.

607
00:51:49,996 --> 00:51:51,043
Rocket.

608
00:51:53,834 --> 00:51:55,335
Rocket.

609
00:51:56,155 --> 00:51:58,651
It really is good to have friends.

610
00:51:59,435 --> 00:52:00,454
Yeah.

611
00:52:06,111 --> 00:52:07,750
Start the incision here.

612
00:52:10,454 --> 00:52:11,675
Keep calm.

613
00:52:14,704 --> 00:52:18,565
- Hold it still.
- I can't. It won't stop moving!

614
00:52:19,893 --> 00:52:22,881
Why did he never tell
us about any of this?

615
00:52:23,024 --> 00:52:25,565
This is worse than what
Thanos did to me.

616
00:52:27,148 --> 00:52:28,577
But what about the pass key?

617
00:52:28,917 --> 00:52:30,029
Is it there?

618
00:52:33,933 --> 00:52:36,232
No. But a file was
removed today.

619
00:52:36,272 --> 00:52:38,752
Downloaded and deleted a
million characters in length.

620
00:52:38,849 --> 00:52:41,047
The biometrics say
it was this man.

621
00:52:41,072 --> 00:52:43,069
Recorder B2H6.

622
00:52:43,304 --> 00:52:45,175
I saw this guy outside
of records today.

623
00:52:47,527 --> 00:52:49,701
Looks like one of the
High Evolutionary's recorders.

624
00:52:50,316 --> 00:52:52,089
The High Evolutionary?

625
00:52:52,633 --> 00:52:54,016
The founder of OrgoCorp?

626
00:52:54,041 --> 00:52:58,066
OrgoCorp is just a way to fund his
experiments that lie outside intergalactic laws.

627
00:52:58,206 --> 00:53:00,376
He's created whole societies.

628
00:53:00,532 --> 00:53:02,810
Xeronians, the Ani-Men.

629
00:53:02,835 --> 00:53:04,036
- Sovereign.
- The Sovereign?

630
00:53:04,061 --> 00:53:06,502
Corners of the universe
consider him god.

631
00:53:08,169 --> 00:53:10,167
- I am Groot.
- Yes.

632
00:53:10,452 --> 00:53:11,808
Yes, what? That he's Groot?

633
00:53:11,833 --> 00:53:15,257
He said maybe this man downloaded the
pass key into the computer on his head.

634
00:53:15,519 --> 00:53:16,442
Huh?

635
00:53:16,467 --> 00:53:18,830
That could store the pass key.

636
00:53:18,855 --> 00:53:20,618
If we find him, we save Rocket.

637
00:53:21,395 --> 00:53:23,779
The High Evolutionary's coordinates.

638
00:53:25,017 --> 00:53:26,525
Put the coordinates in the nav.

639
00:53:26,550 --> 00:53:28,179
Wait a minute.

640
00:53:28,204 --> 00:53:29,631
Are you kidding me?

641
00:53:29,970 --> 00:53:33,018
What he wants is that
gutted badger in the med bay.

642
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:35,040
And you're gonna bring
it straight to him?

643
00:53:35,572 --> 00:53:37,200
It's almost certainly a trap.

644
00:53:37,225 --> 00:53:40,110
A trap isn't a trap if you know the trap
is trying to trap you. It's a face-off.

645
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:41,999
A face-off is a trap

646
00:53:42,024 --> 00:53:46,088
if you're facing off against a guy a thousand
times more powerful than you.

647
00:53:46,719 --> 00:53:48,866
Do you know who
the High Evolutionary is?

648
00:53:48,891 --> 00:53:52,081
Yeah, he's some dickhead who
dissected my best friend.

649
00:53:52,233 --> 00:53:53,040
Second best.

650
00:53:53,065 --> 00:53:56,202
The High Evolutionary isn't someone
you wanna think about messing with.

651
00:53:56,227 --> 00:53:58,136
We won't think about
it when we do it.

652
00:53:58,403 --> 00:54:00,251
You know what? I don't care.

653
00:54:00,276 --> 00:54:03,693
Just drop me off with the Ravagers and
you go do whatever it is that you wanna do.

654
00:54:03,718 --> 00:54:04,925
We don't have time for this.

655
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:07,461
I'm not asking you. Drop me
off with my people now.

656
00:54:07,486 --> 00:54:08,983
Your people?

657
00:54:09,113 --> 00:54:12,564
The Ravagers aren't your people.
I'm a damn Ravager. You aren't.

658
00:54:14,433 --> 00:54:17,224
Listen, I know you were always
looking for a family, okay?

659
00:54:17,249 --> 00:54:20,080
But my Gamora, the one I loved, she
didn't find it with a group of criminals.

660
00:54:20,105 --> 00:54:21,523
She found it with us.

661
00:54:21,666 --> 00:54:23,802
People who care about you.

662
00:54:24,016 --> 00:54:26,013
I know that's who you still are.

663
00:54:26,873 --> 00:54:28,243
Somewhere inside of you...

664
00:54:31,764 --> 00:54:36,725
What are you so afraid of in yourself,
that I need to be something for you?

665
00:54:36,904 --> 00:54:39,666
I don't give a shit
about your Gamora!

666
00:54:39,691 --> 00:54:41,976
Life made me me!

667
00:54:43,656 --> 00:54:46,596
I have a few upgrades courtesy of
that gutted badger in the med bay.

668
00:54:46,621 --> 00:54:49,740
And we are not risking his life
to make yours more convenient.

669
00:54:49,765 --> 00:54:52,917
- I'm family.
- So is he.

670
00:54:57,030 --> 00:54:58,261
Screw you.

671
00:55:00,582 --> 00:55:02,579
Screw all of you.

672
00:55:14,412 --> 00:55:16,410
Found him on the outskirts
of the first shield,

673
00:55:16,592 --> 00:55:18,590
pirating supply ships.

674
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:21,344
I do appreciate this, good sir.

675
00:55:21,369 --> 00:55:25,113
And I appreciate your generous contribution
to the Orgosentry retirement fund.

676
00:55:25,249 --> 00:55:26,510
Your associate.

677
00:55:27,144 --> 00:55:29,951
A Zehoberi named Gamora.

678
00:55:30,323 --> 00:55:32,409
- Where is she now.
- You ain't getting nothing from me!

679
00:55:32,434 --> 00:55:35,117
Oh, we'll see about
that, won't we?

680
00:55:35,733 --> 00:55:37,123
Adam.

681
00:55:38,357 --> 00:55:39,471
Adam!

682
00:55:39,592 --> 00:55:42,297
- Yes, mother.
- Show him we mean business.

683
00:56:03,781 --> 00:56:06,106
I said show him we mean business!

684
00:56:06,131 --> 00:56:07,175
Not disintegrate him!

685
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:08,626
Well, what business could
we have shown him?

686
00:56:08,651 --> 00:56:10,319
But now he is
of no use to us!

687
00:56:10,344 --> 00:56:11,669
Well let's just question the man's friend!

688
00:56:11,694 --> 00:56:14,494
Friend? You think that's
a friend? It's an animal!

689
00:56:16,982 --> 00:56:18,264
He looks sad.

690
00:56:20,094 --> 00:56:22,290
I really don't enjoy how that's
making me feel, actually.

691
00:56:25,103 --> 00:56:28,314
Your friend's a moron. I got
one of those, too. I get it.

692
00:56:28,930 --> 00:56:30,210
Outpost?

693
00:56:30,277 --> 00:56:31,989
This is Gamora. Are you there?

694
00:56:34,458 --> 00:56:36,110
Fitz-Gibbonok, it's me.

695
00:56:41,410 --> 00:56:43,024
Outpost, come in.

696
00:56:44,041 --> 00:56:45,684
Yes, Gamora.

697
00:56:46,284 --> 00:56:47,572
Salutations.

698
00:56:47,891 --> 00:56:49,156
May I help?

699
00:56:49,970 --> 00:56:51,968
Well, I need you guys
to come pick me up.

700
00:56:51,993 --> 00:56:54,916
I'm gonna upload the location
link to the craft I'm on.

701
00:56:55,064 --> 00:56:56,897
Oh, I think we can arrange that.

♪ Do You Realize?? - The Flaming Lips ♪

703
00:57:53,589 --> 00:57:56,898
You need to say to him exactly
what I told you to say.

704
00:57:57,644 --> 00:57:58,739
Why don't you just say it?

705
00:57:58,764 --> 00:58:00,761
No one ever listens to me.

706
00:58:16,147 --> 00:58:17,257
Quill.

707
00:58:18,213 --> 00:58:19,941
Life is a pond.

708
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:26,313
And you've spent your entire life leaping from woman to
woman, as if they are lily pads upon this great pond.

709
00:58:26,727 --> 00:58:29,180
Perhaps what you need to do, Quill...

710
00:58:30,533 --> 00:58:32,169
... is learn to swim.

711
00:58:35,770 --> 00:58:38,037
- That actually made sense.
- Yes it made sense.

712
00:58:38,165 --> 00:58:40,488
No, I mean, that's, that's
sort of an analogy.

713
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:44,302
And I didn't know that you were
capable of that type of thought.

714
00:58:44,388 --> 00:58:46,386
I know lots of analogies, Quill.

715
00:58:46,573 --> 00:58:48,868
Analogies, metaphors, etcetera?

716
00:58:49,930 --> 00:58:50,998
For instance...

717
00:58:52,082 --> 00:58:54,354
Gamora's head is like a lily pad.

718
00:58:54,590 --> 00:58:55,850
Because it's green.

719
00:58:57,079 --> 00:58:58,318
Analogy.

720
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,198
And also, stupid-looking and flappy.

721
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:04,569
- Flappy?
- Because her skin is made of a leaf.

722
00:59:05,034 --> 00:59:07,120
- Metaphor.
- Is it?

723
00:59:07,155 --> 00:59:10,771
Yesterday, I made a poop
shaped like a fish.

724
00:59:10,877 --> 00:59:14,783
Even my butt is capable
of making an analogy.

725
00:59:18,544 --> 00:59:19,574
Oh.

726
00:59:25,045 --> 00:59:26,316

727
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:28,009

Sire.

731
00:59:37,452 --> 00:59:38,871
P13!

732
00:59:44,686 --> 00:59:48,845
Sire was in the middle of his treatment, that's
when we had a breakthrough with that *shiny tube*.

733
00:59:48,877 --> 00:59:50,701
Perhaps then we should resume tomorrow,
yes?

734
00:59:50,702 --> 00:59:52,700
We will not resume tomorrow, no!

735
00:59:52,934 --> 00:59:55,139
P13!

736
00:59:55,252 --> 00:59:59,260
Oh, ooh, there you are.

737
01:00:08,492 --> 01:00:09,617
Hello.

738
01:00:20,331 --> 01:00:26,091
How did you know about
the microsamino proteins, P13?

739
01:00:49,692 --> 01:00:51,690
What happened in there?

740
01:00:52,268 --> 01:00:53,424
Why?

741
01:00:54,013 --> 01:00:56,804
How did you know, P13?

742
01:00:56,829 --> 01:00:58,473
It was too little filtration.

743
01:00:58,498 --> 01:01:01,465
In the hypotomic, yes, we know.
We fixed that.

744
01:01:01,510 --> 01:01:03,186
But how did you know?

745
01:01:03,794 --> 01:01:06,167
I made you!

746
01:01:06,267 --> 01:01:08,265
How did you know!?

747
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:14,408
Because it worked.

748
01:01:21,312 --> 01:01:22,554
It worked.

749
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:27,798
Their rage is gone.

We're going to the new world?

753
01:01:39,453 --> 01:01:42,094
Oh... we?

754
01:01:44,593 --> 01:01:46,043
Look at you.

755
01:01:46,185 --> 01:01:50,499
As if you were cobbled
together by fat-fingered children.

756
01:01:50,524 --> 01:01:53,440
How could you be part
of a perfect species?

757
01:01:53,503 --> 01:01:55,187
You're simply a...

758
01:01:55,365 --> 01:02:00,659
medley of mistakes we could learn from and
apply to the creatures that truly mattered.

759
01:02:01,533 --> 01:02:03,234
Batch 89...

760
01:02:03,653 --> 01:02:06,667
was never meant for
the new world, P13.

761
01:02:06,818 --> 01:02:12,176
You could figure out the complex workings
of cytoplasmic filtration systems,

762
01:02:12,230 --> 01:02:14,228
but you couldn't figure out that?

763
01:02:18,290 --> 01:02:19,784
But that brain...

764
01:02:21,066 --> 01:02:23,063
That, I'd like to study further.

765
01:02:27,681 --> 01:02:31,131

removal in the morning.

01:10:23,768 --> 01:10:27,635
♪ I'm Always Chasing Rainbows - Alice Cooper ♪

876
01:10:42,215 --> 01:10:44,497
You must be
a really loyal pet

877
01:10:45,215 --> 01:10:47,970
if they're willing to
do all this for you.

878
01:11:56,966 --> 01:11:58,679
This is the perfect society?

879
01:12:20,690 --> 01:12:21,452
Sire...

880
01:12:21,477 --> 01:12:25,456
This one has been running for two
hours without breaking a sweat.

881
01:12:25,489 --> 01:12:26,252
That's incredible, you...

882
01:12:26,277 --> 01:12:31,089
They can survive on 30 calories a day, an hour
of sleep a week, they're always happy,

883
01:12:31,191 --> 01:12:35,397
And they can rewire a carbonetrix
core in under two minutes.

884
01:12:35,896 --> 01:12:38,573
But will she be ready
for the new colony?

885
01:12:39,325 --> 01:12:41,323
Sire, they're here.

886
01:12:47,772 --> 01:12:48,951
Here we go.

887
01:12:56,931 --> 01:13:00,415
- We're here to see...
- The High Evolutionary's expecting you.

888
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:02,085
Which means it is a trap.

889
01:13:02,110 --> 01:13:03,341
It's a face-off.

890
01:13:03,366 --> 01:13:04,885
She stays here.

891
01:13:04,910 --> 01:13:06,930
- Why?
- Policy against weaponry.

892
01:13:06,955 --> 01:13:08,953
And your arm is a gun.

893
01:13:13,293 --> 01:13:15,155
- He's clean.
- Let's go.

894
01:13:15,657 --> 01:13:16,661
Hey.

895
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:19,010
It'll be okay.

896
01:13:40,017 --> 01:13:41,238
Move it!

897
01:14:01,004 --> 01:14:03,002
Are you okay, Rocket?

898
01:14:20,678 --> 01:14:22,326
Me and Rocket play now?

899
01:14:22,351 --> 01:14:23,770
I can't right now, Floor.

900
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:33,649
- What are you doing?
- They ain't gonna set us free.

901
01:14:34,522 --> 01:14:38,129
Yes they are, Rocket. We're going
to the new world any day now.

902
01:14:41,417 --> 01:14:42,865
No, that can't be true.

903
01:14:42,916 --> 01:14:44,028
It is.

904
01:14:44,774 --> 01:14:46,772
They wanna kill
us all in the morning.

905
01:14:46,796 --> 01:14:48,406
- What?
- What?

906
01:14:49,095 --> 01:14:51,092
But I'm gonna fix it.

907
01:14:56,309 --> 01:14:57,512
What is that?

908
01:14:57,580 --> 01:14:58,807
It's a key.

909
01:14:59,576 --> 01:15:01,573
I'm gonna use it to
get us all outta here.

910
01:15:02,688 --> 01:15:04,686
I don't know if
that's wise, Rocket.

911
01:15:05,868 --> 01:15:10,128
Me, Rocket, leave!
Hurray, friends forever!

912
01:15:10,532 --> 01:15:12,018
Just down that hall,

913
01:15:12,216 --> 01:15:13,493
there's ships.

914
01:15:14,204 --> 01:15:18,082
I know that if we can
get to one, I can pilot it.

915
01:15:18,620 --> 01:15:20,766
And then we'll all
fly away together.

916
01:15:21,067 --> 01:15:24,503
The four of us, just like
we always said, okay?

917
01:15:26,919 --> 01:15:28,103
Okay?

918
01:15:31,185 --> 01:15:35,415
Woohoo! Yippee, Rocket!
Sky, sky, sky!

919
01:15:58,770 --> 01:16:00,045
You did it!

920
01:16:00,092 --> 01:16:03,603
You did it!
You did it, you did it!

921
01:16:24,933 --> 01:16:26,033
You did it!

922
01:16:27,176 --> 01:16:28,176
You did it.

923
01:16:29,834 --> 01:16:31,207
It really is good to have fr---

924
01:16:48,373 --> 01:16:51,217
Yes, I imagined you'd
do something like this.

925
01:16:52,246 --> 01:16:53,987
Back in the cage, P13.

926
01:17:00,110 --> 01:17:01,510
Sky.

927
01:17:15,765 --> 01:17:19,309
Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now!
Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now!

928
01:17:19,357 --> 01:17:23,203
Q12 and P13 escaped
from their pens.

929
01:17:23,363 --> 01:17:25,707
Q12 is neutralized, but...

930
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:27,315
P13 is still out,

931
01:17:27,340 --> 01:17:29,235
so I'll need assistance.

932
01:17:29,525 --> 01:17:31,139
Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now!

933
01:17:31,164 --> 01:17:32,543
Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now!

934
01:17:32,568 --> 01:17:34,533
Remember, not
to bruise its brain.

935
01:17:42,015 --> 01:17:44,013
Alright, P13!

936
01:17:44,038 --> 01:17:46,940
You win the crying contest,
now back in the cage!

937
01:17:50,455 --> 01:17:52,217
Rocket, Teefs, Floor go now!

938
01:17:52,542 --> 01:17:54,916
Just go! Rocket, please!

939
01:17:54,944 --> 01:17:57,139
Rocket! Rocket!

940
01:17:59,559 --> 01:18:01,557
Down here, hurry!

941
01:18:59,001 --> 01:19:01,601
- Hey, get 'em in here!
- (yelling & shooting)

942
01:19:01,771 --> 01:19:02,294
Hey!

943
01:19:02,318 --> 01:19:03,758
He's getting away!

944
01:19:47,860 --> 01:19:49,094
What are you doing?

945
01:19:49,119 --> 01:19:50,623
I've got a bad feeling about this.

946
01:19:50,648 --> 01:19:52,472
Peter just told you to stay here.

947
01:19:52,504 --> 01:19:53,729
Yeah well, that's his fault.

948
01:19:53,754 --> 01:19:56,686
He should know by now that I never
do anything that anyone ever tells me.

949
01:19:57,048 --> 01:19:58,856
We need to protect Rocket.

950
01:19:59,181 --> 01:20:00,705
Yeah, that's right.

951
01:20:01,125 --> 01:20:03,788
So hop on. And we'll
ride back to the ship.

952
01:20:03,813 --> 01:20:05,465
Just right over there?

953
01:20:06,265 --> 01:20:07,307
Yeah.

954
01:20:17,717 --> 01:20:21,043
Drax! Hey, stop being a jerk.

955
01:20:29,757 --> 01:20:32,880
You! Hey! Yeah, you.

956
01:20:34,231 --> 01:20:36,992
I take it the pass key, it's in
that thing on your head.

957
01:20:37,179 --> 01:20:39,176
I would advise
against aggression.

958
01:20:39,943 --> 01:20:42,072
Oh, got time for me now?

959
01:20:42,477 --> 01:20:45,443
Your friend once took advantage.

960
01:20:45,908 --> 01:20:47,417
I learned my lessons.

961
01:20:47,754 --> 01:20:53,332
I aimed some small part of my mental
capacity back in my own direction.

962
01:20:53,357 --> 01:20:57,437
And now, gravity itself
serves my whims.

963
01:20:58,007 --> 01:21:00,277
War Pig, now.

964
01:21:03,781 --> 01:21:06,138
You must find Counter-Earth familiar.

965
01:21:06,163 --> 01:21:09,376
- Counter-Earth.
- I visited your planet many years ago.

966
01:21:09,401 --> 01:21:11,202
Earth hasn't been my
planet in a long time.

967
01:21:11,227 --> 01:21:12,403
Your people had...

968
01:21:13,235 --> 01:21:14,770
- Wonderful spirit.
- Mmm.

969
01:21:14,834 --> 01:21:17,164
The art and music and literature,

970
01:21:17,189 --> 01:21:19,145
were some of the
finest in the universe.

971
01:21:19,795 --> 01:21:24,880
Earth would be a fabulous place were
it not for the ignorance and bigotry.

972
01:21:24,906 --> 01:21:27,417
- Okay.
- It inspired me to create Counter-Earth.

973
01:21:27,442 --> 01:21:30,320
- I don't care.
- All of the good and none of the bad.

974
01:21:30,345 --> 01:21:33,324
I don't need another speech
by some impotent whackjob

975
01:21:33,349 --> 01:21:37,233
whose mother didn't love him, rationalizing
why he needs to conquer the universe.

976
01:21:37,427 --> 01:21:40,839
I'm not trying to
conquer the universe...

977
01:21:40,934 --> 01:21:42,266
I'm perfecting it.

978
01:21:48,072 --> 01:21:49,563
What the...

979
01:22:08,925 --> 01:22:09,961
Hey!

980
01:22:10,302 --> 01:22:12,114
Drop the badger.

981
01:22:16,523 --> 01:22:17,796
I just want the pass key.

982
01:22:17,821 --> 01:22:20,191
Then bring me 89P13.

983
01:22:20,216 --> 01:22:21,705
I am Groot.

984
01:22:21,966 --> 01:22:23,789
He says suck my---

985
01:22:23,814 --> 01:22:25,404
Why are you so angry?

986
01:22:25,429 --> 01:22:27,426
Because I know what
you did to our friend.

987
01:22:27,862 --> 01:22:30,959
Anything I've done, I've done for
the betterment of the universe.

988
01:22:30,984 --> 01:22:37,877
Newsflash, Einstein. Better universes generally don't include
a bunch of octopuses selling meth to guys with cockroach heads.

989
01:22:38,911 --> 01:22:40,098
They do not.

990
01:22:42,483 --> 01:22:45,919
Which is why, as I've
done many times before...

991
01:22:46,192 --> 01:22:48,499
I'm going to have to raze it all,

992
01:22:48,688 --> 01:22:50,117
and start again.

993
01:22:50,243 --> 01:22:51,243
What?

994
01:22:59,708 --> 01:23:03,187
I got 89P13 and
I'm on my way.

995
01:23:03,212 --> 01:23:04,655
We're in possession of the subject.

996
01:23:31,533 --> 01:23:32,922
Oh, my God.

997
01:23:43,568 --> 01:23:44,986
I am Groot?

998
01:23:45,091 --> 01:23:46,133
Kill them all.

999
01:23:48,325 --> 01:23:49,659
Stay.

1000
01:23:50,789 --> 01:23:52,406
Ah, ah! I said stay.

1001
01:23:53,700 --> 01:23:56,635
What? Did you want me to leave you
back so that mother could fillet you?

1002
01:23:57,483 --> 01:23:58,576
Stay.

1003
01:23:58,865 --> 01:24:02,270
What the hell, we're working
for the same boss.

1004
01:24:02,295 --> 01:24:06,538
Yes, but I need the credit, chum.
To save my entire civilization.

1005
01:24:07,298 --> 01:24:10,385
So be a good creepy... thing,

1006
01:24:10,596 --> 01:24:11,696
and back off.

1007
01:24:21,133 --> 01:24:22,358
Oh.

1008
01:25:02,607 --> 01:25:03,979
Mother.

1009
01:25:26,997 --> 01:25:28,158
Mother!

1010
01:25:33,539 --> 01:25:35,119
Mantis and Drax, come in.

1011
01:25:35,532 --> 01:25:37,530
Mantis, Drax?

1012
01:25:38,248 --> 01:25:41,228
- Uh, hey.
- I need you to bring the ship here, now!

1013
01:25:41,253 --> 01:25:43,889
Well, we can't do that exactly, because...

1014
01:25:44,541 --> 01:25:45,731
We're not at the ship.

1015
01:25:45,756 --> 01:25:47,159
Then where the hell are y...?

1016
01:26:14,905 --> 01:26:16,510
- Nebula, come in.
- Gamora!

1017
01:26:16,535 --> 01:26:19,756
Take off now! Get yourself
and Rocket off the planet!

1018
01:26:24,964 --> 01:26:26,392
What kind of ship is this?

1019
01:26:29,864 --> 01:26:31,433
It's amusing, really.

1020
01:26:31,458 --> 01:26:33,157
How stupid are you, hmm?

1021
01:26:33,182 --> 01:26:35,015
It was so obviously a trap.

1022
01:26:35,102 --> 01:26:37,871
It's not a trap, it's a face-off!

1023
01:26:38,328 --> 01:26:40,196
Now, kill them all.

1024
01:26:41,385 --> 01:26:43,385
What do you have in your hand?

1025
01:26:46,586 --> 01:26:47,585
Grenade!

1026
01:27:25,758 --> 01:27:29,307
I am Groot!

1027
01:27:32,251 --> 01:27:34,911
♪ San Francisco - The Mowgli’s ♪

1028
01:28:02,450 --> 01:28:04,560
No, no, no. No, please.

1029
01:28:04,585 --> 01:28:06,520
Please spare me. Hey!

1030
01:28:06,618 --> 01:28:08,018
Spare me.

1031
01:28:09,501 --> 01:28:10,501
Oh!

1032
01:28:11,265 --> 01:28:13,362
Thank you, thank you.

1033
01:28:13,460 --> 01:28:14,226
Thank you!

1034
01:28:14,250 --> 01:28:15,649
That'd be premature.

1035
01:28:15,771 --> 01:28:17,530
Huh? No, no, no, no!

1036
01:28:28,959 --> 01:28:30,956
Quite a novel escape plan.

1037
01:28:31,037 --> 01:28:33,601
Jumping headfirst into
an exploding planet.

1038
01:28:38,403 --> 01:28:40,140
You'll kill us both!

1039
01:28:40,165 --> 01:28:41,795
Not both!

1040
01:28:57,659 --> 01:28:58,800
Why are we doing this?

1041
01:28:58,825 --> 01:29:01,835
Quill and Groot are inside!
We have to get them out.

1042
01:29:30,750 --> 01:29:31,889
Groot.

1043
01:29:47,778 --> 01:29:50,265
Whoever's in the cockpit,
activate the brake.

1044
01:29:50,290 --> 01:29:52,256
The steering mechanism is stuck!

1045
01:29:52,281 --> 01:29:53,777
Well, pull harder!

1046
01:29:59,454 --> 01:30:01,022
Let's go!

1047
01:30:21,262 --> 01:30:23,260
It's hard to breathe.

1048
01:30:30,141 --> 01:30:32,139
We are entering space.

1049
01:30:56,893 --> 01:30:58,075
Joob joob?

1050
01:30:58,099 --> 01:30:59,392
Oh, piss off.

1051
01:31:08,951 --> 01:31:11,706
What kind of monster
slaughters a civilization?

1052
01:31:12,154 --> 01:31:14,152
- Where are Mantis and Drax?
- I don't know!

1053
01:31:22,105 --> 01:31:23,982
Ha! You're lucky I was able
to knock down that door.

1054
01:31:24,007 --> 01:31:26,886
Rocket and Gamora are
probably dead because of you!

1055
01:31:27,012 --> 01:31:28,845
- I didn't know.
- Oh, you didn't know?

1056
01:31:28,870 --> 01:31:32,168
When are you gonna stop using the
excuse of being some big dumb clown

1057
01:31:32,193 --> 01:31:35,748
for contributing nothing, and the
rest of us having to carry your slack!

1058
01:31:35,773 --> 01:31:38,513
Don't push him! You don't have
the right to push him.

1059
01:31:38,538 --> 01:31:40,374
And you, you're no better.

1060
01:31:40,399 --> 01:31:45,306
The only thing we can count on you for, is when someone
shows weakness, you'll be right there to support it.

1061
01:31:45,331 --> 01:31:46,766
Fine, I don't care.

1062
01:31:46,791 --> 01:31:50,339
I know you need to find fault in everyone
else to make yourself feel okay.

1063
01:31:50,553 --> 01:31:51,705
So find it in me.

1064
01:31:51,730 --> 01:31:53,242
Oh, go to hell, Mant!

1065
01:31:53,267 --> 01:31:55,265
But you don't have
the right to push him!

1066
01:31:55,581 --> 01:31:57,394
It's not his fault he's stupid.

1067
01:31:57,885 --> 01:31:58,884
He's a liability.

1068
01:31:58,909 --> 01:32:03,301
He makes us laugh and he loves
us. How is that a liability?

1069
01:32:03,618 --> 01:32:07,172
All you care about is
intelligence and competence.

1070
01:32:07,197 --> 01:32:09,216
Not sure I appreciate this defense.

1071
01:32:09,241 --> 01:32:10,768
He has sadness...

1072
01:32:10,856 --> 01:32:13,726
But he's the only one of you
who doesn't hate himself.

1073
01:32:14,141 --> 01:32:15,950
I don't care if he's stupid.

1074
01:32:16,676 --> 01:32:18,167
Do you think I'm stupid?

1075
01:32:19,488 --> 01:32:20,570
Yes.

1076
01:32:24,329 --> 01:32:25,548
Forget.

1077
01:32:28,314 --> 01:32:31,483
Ha! You're lucky I was able to knock
down that door with my incredible strength.

1078
01:32:32,187 --> 01:32:33,372
Quill?

1079
01:32:33,926 --> 01:32:35,783
Quill, are you there?

1080
01:32:35,876 --> 01:32:38,609
Joob joob (alien language)?

1081
01:32:39,862 --> 01:32:42,190
That language isn't in my translator.

1082
01:33:16,163 --> 01:33:17,312
Okay.

1083
01:33:17,564 --> 01:33:19,498
Alright, Rocket. Go.

1084
01:33:36,985 --> 01:33:38,233
Lylla?

1085
01:33:40,881 --> 01:33:42,525
Friend.

1086
01:33:45,318 --> 01:33:47,144
Okay. Okay...

1087
01:33:47,169 --> 01:33:48,526
Okay, here we go.

1088
01:33:51,917 --> 01:33:53,379
This isn't right.

1089
01:33:53,862 --> 01:33:56,111
No, no, no. It's good.
It's gonna work. It's working.

1090
01:33:56,136 --> 01:33:57,539
It needs to be faster.

1091
01:34:00,059 --> 01:34:02,908
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

1092
01:34:05,089 --> 01:34:07,714
- Rocket.
- I let you down.

1093
01:34:08,286 --> 01:34:10,882
I got you killed.
I got you all killed.

1094
01:34:12,425 --> 01:34:13,941
We were right.

1095
01:34:14,472 --> 01:34:16,384
The sky is beautiful.

1096
01:34:16,409 --> 01:34:17,897
And it is forever.

1097
01:34:18,638 --> 01:34:21,557
And I've been flying
with our friends.

1098
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:36,579
Can I come?

1099
01:34:36,703 --> 01:34:37,780
Yes.

1100
01:34:47,997 --> 01:34:49,182
No, no, no, no.

1101
01:34:49,479 --> 01:34:50,485
No!

1102
01:34:52,406 --> 01:34:54,052
- Come on!
- Quill.

1103
01:34:56,876 --> 01:34:58,304
No!

1104
01:34:58,400 --> 01:35:00,397
No!

1105
01:35:02,895 --> 01:35:04,352
- Quill...
- No!

1106
01:35:05,306 --> 01:35:07,512
- Quill.
- I'm not gonna lose him.
- He is gone.

1107
01:35:07,537 --> 01:35:10,508
I'm not letting him go!

1108
01:35:26,432 --> 01:35:27,668
But not yet.

1109
01:35:28,935 --> 01:35:31,336
You still have a purpose here.

1110
01:35:31,568 --> 01:35:32,928
A purpose for what?

1111
01:35:33,694 --> 01:35:35,292
They made us for nothing!

1112
01:35:35,426 --> 01:35:38,406
Just stupid experiments
to be thrown away!

1113
01:35:39,022 --> 01:35:41,020
There are the hands that made us...

1114
01:35:41,168 --> 01:35:43,938
and then there are the
hands that guide the hands.

1115
01:35:51,311 --> 01:35:53,309
My beloved raccoon...

1116
01:35:54,104 --> 01:35:58,093
This story has been yours
all along. You just didn't know it.

1117
01:36:01,925 --> 01:36:03,176
I'm not a raccoo...

1118
01:36:10,908 --> 01:36:12,305
The pass key's going through!

1119
01:36:30,451 --> 01:36:31,451
Quill.

1120
01:36:50,327 --> 01:36:51,603
Where's Nebula?

1121
01:36:57,639 --> 01:36:59,292
She, she's, uh...

1122
01:37:00,163 --> 01:37:02,063
Because her code is on
the comm behind you.

1123
01:37:08,410 --> 01:37:09,977
- What... Nebula?
- Where are you?

1124
01:37:10,002 --> 01:37:12,433
- Oh, thank God!
- We're here to get you out of here.

1125
01:37:12,585 --> 01:37:14,160
- Out of where?
- The High Evolutionary's ship!

1126
01:37:14,185 --> 01:37:15,377
No, I got off the ship.

1127
01:37:15,733 --> 01:37:17,266
- You what?
- Wait, where are you?

1128
01:37:17,314 --> 01:37:18,467
On the ship!

1129
01:37:18,492 --> 01:37:20,020
- On the ship?!
- I didn't lie.

1130
01:37:20,045 --> 01:37:22,907
- Why are you on the ship?
- To save you, obviously!

1131
01:37:22,932 --> 01:37:27,246
No, I told you to go back. You gotta know by now I
always figure out an incredibly clever way to get out of a fix!

1132
01:37:27,362 --> 01:37:29,360
- Tell him I said hi.
- Really?

1133
01:37:29,464 --> 01:37:31,023
Tell him we're coming to save him.

1134
01:37:31,048 --> 01:37:34,246
Pay attention or play with
the kids. One or the other.

1135
01:37:34,271 --> 01:37:36,774
- Play with the kids?
- How did you get out?

1136
01:37:36,799 --> 01:37:39,209
- That's not really important...
- I am Groot.

1137
01:37:39,337 --> 01:37:44,350
Jumping a 1000 feet to your death without a
parachute is a clever way of getting out of a fix?

1138
01:37:44,893 --> 01:37:47,004
You're all just making up
stuff that he's saying, right?

1139
01:37:47,270 --> 01:37:49,689
The important thing
is we're all okay.

1140
01:37:53,284 --> 01:37:54,300
Rocket?

1141
01:37:55,262 --> 01:37:58,490
Yeah, he's here and he's okay.

1142
01:38:04,214 --> 01:38:08,198
Rocket, we love you very much
and we're happy you're alive.

1143
01:38:08,943 --> 01:38:10,601
Well that makes you the idiots, then.

1144
01:38:10,642 --> 01:38:12,640
He's right about that.

1145
01:38:14,076 --> 01:38:15,463
Back in your cages!

1146
01:38:19,593 --> 01:38:20,816
Nebula?

1147
01:38:21,836 --> 01:38:23,329
Nebula, come in.

1148
01:38:28,934 --> 01:38:32,178
So, you'd like to joust, would you?

1149
01:38:34,119 --> 01:38:36,267
Go to hell, you sick
son of a bitch.

1150
01:38:36,418 --> 01:38:37,968
You killed all of those people.

1151
01:38:37,993 --> 01:38:39,677
As I will your friends.

1152
01:38:40,365 --> 01:38:42,363
I'm sending you the coordinates.

1153
01:38:42,612 --> 01:38:46,107
They will die unless you
bring me what is mine!

1154
01:38:46,131 --> 01:38:54,394
Screw you, you stretch-faced, Robocop-looking,
Skeletor-wannabe, purple-nurple, piece of---

1155
01:38:57,228 --> 01:38:58,303
He hung up.

1156
01:39:01,167 --> 01:39:02,260
You think?

1157
01:39:03,051 --> 01:39:05,491
♪ Poor Girl - X ♪

1158
01:39:05,515 --> 01:39:07,301
1966...

1159
01:39:07,425 --> 01:39:09,617
The Soviets put me on a rocket

1160
01:39:09,642 --> 01:39:15,268
knowing full well I never to return
and I will die in a fiery ball of death.

1161
01:39:15,371 --> 01:39:18,335
The one thing even mudak Soviets never do,

1162
01:39:18,360 --> 01:39:20,473
is call me "bad dog."

1163
01:39:20,518 --> 01:39:22,962
Oh, my God, just, just let it go.

1164
01:39:22,987 --> 01:39:25,826
Kraglin, please, just take it back.

1165
01:39:25,851 --> 01:39:27,230
This is killing us.

1166
01:39:27,255 --> 01:39:31,561
I can't take it back if she
is, in fact, a bad dog.

1167
01:39:32,296 --> 01:39:34,815
It never stops hurting.

1168
01:39:35,494 --> 01:39:38,413
- Kraglin.
- Oh, hey, Pete.

1169
01:39:38,520 --> 01:39:40,745
We need to save
Nebula, Mantis and Drax,

1170
01:39:40,770 --> 01:39:42,330
and we need your help.

1171
01:39:42,355 --> 01:39:43,516
Me?

1172
01:39:47,034 --> 01:39:49,032
You're the one who
lost him, you twit!

1173
01:39:49,057 --> 01:39:50,938
The hellspawn had it, sire,

1174
01:39:50,962 --> 01:39:53,801
- But...
- But, but, but, but, but!

1175
01:39:55,404 --> 01:39:57,328
That rancid word.

1176
01:40:00,271 --> 01:40:02,588
I'm merely wondering
whether it might be wiser,

1177
01:40:02,613 --> 01:40:06,138
to go directly to the new colony and
not engage in unnecessary conflict.

1178
01:40:06,163 --> 01:40:10,001
They can rewire a carbonetrix
core in under two minutes.

1179
01:40:10,026 --> 01:40:11,670
But what is that, Vim?

1180
01:40:12,430 --> 01:40:15,315
- Rote memorization.
- Rote memorization!

1181
01:40:15,932 --> 01:40:20,917
In hundreds of years of our creations,
only one has known true invention.

1182
01:40:21,283 --> 01:40:22,315
One.

1183
01:40:24,011 --> 01:40:26,008
Putrid in every other way,

1184
01:40:26,094 --> 01:40:28,955
but 89P13 had that.

1185
01:40:31,772 --> 01:40:32,997
Yes, sire.

1186
01:40:33,822 --> 01:40:36,594
A populace unable to think,

1187
01:40:36,663 --> 01:40:39,097
what hasn't yet been thought, will die

1188
01:40:39,179 --> 01:40:43,243
on the vine. We need 89P13's brain

1189
01:40:43,268 --> 01:40:46,840
so we can transfer that
trait into these creatures

1190
01:40:46,877 --> 01:40:48,969
before we go to the new colony.

1191
01:40:48,994 --> 01:40:50,820
Nothing else matters.

1192
01:41:11,026 --> 01:41:12,680
How did they get down here?

1193
01:41:12,743 --> 01:41:13,743
Joob joob.

1194
01:41:15,522 --> 01:41:18,048
Peter will be trying to
get to the spaceport.

1195
01:41:18,273 --> 01:41:20,046
He doesn't know about the children.

1196
01:41:20,356 --> 01:41:21,482
You!

1197
01:41:22,496 --> 01:41:27,350
We need you to let all the other children onboard
know to stay away from the starboard walls!

1198
01:41:28,710 --> 01:41:29,710
Joob joob?

1199
01:41:29,881 --> 01:41:32,399
They know three freaking words
and two of them are joob.

1200
01:41:32,835 --> 01:41:33,607
Joob joob.

1201
01:41:33,631 --> 01:41:35,629
No! Listen to me.

1202
01:41:36,268 --> 01:41:38,665
You need to talk
to the other children.

1203
01:41:38,762 --> 01:41:41,513
All of them here, and tell them,

1204
01:41:41,538 --> 01:41:43,535
to stay away, from the freakin'----

1205
01:41:43,560 --> 01:41:45,197
What the hell are you
doing, Mantis?

1206
01:41:45,221 --> 01:41:47,951
Explaining it, dickhead!

1207
01:41:52,376 --> 01:41:53,416
Joob joob el.

1208
01:41:56,435 --> 01:41:57,475
Joob joob el!

1209
01:41:58,821 --> 01:42:00,085
You're scaring them.

1210
01:42:06,248 --> 01:42:07,607
Hello, dumb idiots.

1211
01:42:12,096 --> 01:42:14,094
I had a little girl like you.

1212
01:42:14,119 --> 01:42:15,489
You know what she used to like?

1213
01:42:16,371 --> 01:42:18,641
She liked when I
made monkey noises.

1214
01:42:29,066 --> 01:42:30,440
How is that a monkey?

1215
01:42:31,349 --> 01:42:32,547
Beats me.

1216
01:42:59,135 --> 01:43:02,815
(speaks alien language)

1217
01:43:04,376 --> 01:43:06,256
(responds alien language)

1218
01:43:06,510 --> 01:43:07,510
(replies alien language),
Joob joob.

1219
01:43:07,776 --> 01:43:08,776
Joob joob.

1220
01:43:11,418 --> 01:43:13,798
- Joob joob.
- (all) Joob joob!

1221
01:43:14,023 --> 01:43:16,346
They're gonna tell the other kids to stay

1222
01:43:16,381 --> 01:43:19,490
Why didn't you tell us you knew
their language this whole time?

1223
01:43:19,618 --> 01:43:21,003
Why didn't you ask?

1224
01:43:23,950 --> 01:43:25,948
This could be futile, Quill.

01:43:26,360 --> 01:43:27,614
He's too powerful.

1226
01:43:27,715 --> 01:43:29,346
Well then, I guess we'll die trying.

1227
01:43:29,655 --> 01:43:31,945
What is dying trying gonna accomplish?

1228
01:43:32,250 --> 01:43:33,951
Or we can just give
him the badger.

1229
01:43:33,976 --> 01:43:36,385

02:06:51,248 --> 02:06:53,073
All I wanted to do...

1377
02:06:53,674 --> 02:06:56,840
was to make things perfect.

1378
02:06:57,755 --> 02:07:00,146
You didn't want to
make things perfect.

1379
02:07:00,326 --> 02:07:02,898

I'm okay.

I am Groot.

1408
02:11:33,365 --> 02:11:36,043
Thanks, just tell them
I'm gonna be right...

1409

I am Groot.

1410

Yeah. It's good working
with you too.

Hey Gamora, are you ready?

1412

Yeah.

1413
02:12:05,526 --> 02:12:07,524
You know I'm still not
who you want me to be.

1414
02:12:09,238 --> 02:12:10,257
I know.

1415
02:12:11,567 --> 02:12:13,393
But who you are ain't so bad.

1416

I bet we were fun.

Are you okay?

1421
02:13:07,040 --> 02:13:09,038
I think I need to
talk to everybody.

1422
02:13:11,390 --> 02:13:13,388
So, you're gonna leave?

1423
02:13:15,253 --> 02:13:19,373
My mother died in front of me when I was 8
years old and I have been running ever since.

1424
02:13:20,643 --> 02:13:22,217
I'm gonna need to take some time.

1425

Learn how to swim.

1426
02:13:29,131 --> 02:13:30,262
I as well.

1427
02:13:34,660 --> 02:13:36,128
I love you all.

1428
02:13:36,550 --> 02:13:37,632
I do.

1429
02:13:41,623 --> 02:13:45,173
But my whole life, I did
whatever Ego wanted.

1430
02:13:45,298 --> 02:13:47,876
And then I did whatever
the Guardians wanted.

1431
02:13:48,909 --> 02:13:52,210
I need to go out and
discover what I want.

1432
02:13:52,363 --> 02:13:54,488
- I will come with you.
- No Drax.

1433
02:13:54,713 --> 02:13:55,956
That's the whole point.

1434
02:13:55,981 --> 02:13:57,467
But you need someone to protect you.

1435
02:13:57,492 --> 02:13:59,241
- I don't.
- Not in a bad way.

1436
02:13:59,453 --> 02:14:01,057
Just because of your
incredible weakness.

1437
02:14:01,082 --> 02:14:02,958
Oh, my God, you're so frustrating.

1438
02:14:02,983 --> 02:14:05,859
Drax, I need you here.

1439
02:14:06,531 --> 02:14:08,320
We're building a new society.

1440
02:14:08,590 --> 02:14:11,053
I need all the support I can get
for those children out there.

1441
02:14:12,415 --> 02:14:15,273
Today, I saw who you are.

1442
02:14:16,280 --> 02:14:18,089
You weren't born
to be a destroyer.

1443
02:14:19,993 --> 02:14:21,459
You were born
to be a dad.

1444
02:14:26,090 --> 02:14:27,914
So you'll lead the Guardians then?

1445
02:14:28,484 --> 02:14:29,524
No.

02:14:30,024 --> 02:14:31,369
I'm going to lead the city.

1447

Make it the type of
home I never had.

1448
02:14:36,825 --> 02:14:38,242

1449

1450
02:14:41,515 --> 02:14:42,577
No.

1451
02:14:43,190 --> 02:14:45,252
Well, the galaxy still
needs its guardians.

1452
02:14:46,337 --> 02:14:49,048
And you, will make a better
leader than I ever was...
