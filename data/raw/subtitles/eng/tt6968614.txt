1
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,500
Throw away the gun.

2
00:27:45,583 --> 00:27:46,625
Calm down.

3
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:49,416
Where's the girl?

4
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,041
What's he done with her?

5
00:28:50,166 --> 00:28:51,916
Count those tiles. He's a cheater.

6
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,208
- Shut up, old woman!
- I won't shut up!

7
00:29:00,125 --> 00:29:01,666
Stop that bitch!

8
00:29:05,291 --> 00:29:07,208
Get the hell out of my house!

9
00:30:17,541 --> 00:30:18,916
You fucked up my car.

10
00:31:51,458 --> 00:31:53,291
What about the girl?

11
00:31:53,375 --> 00:31:54,583
Where's the girl?

12
00:31:56,375 --> 00:31:57,375
What girl?

13
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:04,833
Where's the girl?

14
00:32:07,166 --> 00:32:08,166
What'd he say?

15
00:32:15,916 --> 00:32:17,125
What happened?

16
00:32:19,458 --> 00:32:20,625
You get tired?

17
00:32:20,708 --> 00:32:21,791
Hector's whore.

18
00:32:42,541 --> 00:32:43,916
Where you going?

19
00:32:46,791 --> 00:32:47,833
You gonna kiss me?

20
00:33:04,458 --> 00:33:05,875
Tell me, asshole.

21
00:33:06,833 --> 00:33:08,833
Where's the girl?

22
00:33:16,625 --> 00:33:18,083
What's waiting for me?

23
00:33:18,708 --> 00:33:20,000
How many guards?

24
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:22,083
All of them.

25
00:33:32,958 --> 00:33:34,500
He doesn't want you.

26
00:33:34,583 --> 00:33:36,333
And the things he's gonna do to her,

27
00:33:37,416 --> 00:33:39,458
she's never gonna forget.

28
00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:10,208
Lower the gun...

29
00:46:22,208 --> 00:46:23,625
Hands up.

30
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:26,916
Turn around.

31
00:46:28,083 --> 00:46:29,125
Turn.

32
00:46:31,708 --> 00:46:33,708
Yes. Slow like that.

33
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:38,333
So hot...

34
00:54:46,875 --> 00:54:48,083
Look, here is the head.

35
00:54:49,666 --> 00:54:50,666
And this

36
00:54:51,833 --> 00:54:52,833
is the heart.

37
00:54:53,416 --> 00:54:54,416
Do you see it?
