1
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,958
- I wish I could be like her.
- I also wish it.

2
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,040
But you're a servant girl, Maya.

3
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,958
- I must go, she'll be waiting.
- And I?

4
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,040
You can't go. But I'll come and tell you everything.

5
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,999
So, Kamasutra, the greatest book of love ever written.

6
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,040
- "Kama" means...
- Love.

7
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,858
And "Sutra" means?

8
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:53,958
Lessons?

9
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Very good.

10
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
So, we have it.

11
00:02:57,958 --> 00:02:58,958
Lessons on love.

12
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,978
An ancient book on men and women

13
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:03,040
and their relationship through life together.

14
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,958
Now, why do we study it, you may all ask,

15
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,958
when it was written so many hundreds of years ago?

16
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,999
Because love remains as meaningful
and myterious today as it was then.

17
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,940
The Kamasutra teaches us the many
ways we use our body for love.

18
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,958
It also teaches us

19
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,958
that the ways of love are much deeper.

20
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,999
But of course, it tells us we must
learn to use our body very well, so...

21
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:33,958
lift up your skirts

22
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,999
and look at your...

23
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:37,940
feet.

24
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,958
One doesn't pay much attention to one's feet or toes.

25
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,999
But believe me when I tell you...

26
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,958
if you touch the toes and feet

27
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,999
in a certain way,

28
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:53,040
it can bring great pleasure to you lover.

29
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,999
Maya, is that you?

30
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,958
Why do I have to wear Tara's clothes,
when she never wears mine?

31
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,958
What have I done in my past life
to inherit you from my mother?

32
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,999
Just because Tara and Biki drank from
my breast they let you play with her.

33
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,958
So what if you bathe with Tara?

34
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,958
That doesn't mean you can become a maharani yourself.

35
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,999
Be grateful they let you dance with her.

36
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,040
Maya.

37
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Biki.

38
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,999
Just because you're a prince, you think you can spy on me?

39
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,958
One day, I will be King,

40
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,040
and you will be my Queen...

41
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,999
and my slave.

42
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,999
I'm no one's slave, forever!

43
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,958
I want to know everything Tara knows.

44
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,999
You are truly pagli.

45
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,040
My mad one.

46
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,999
Hips just like your mother.

47
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,040
And then she dances one Jhalak,

48
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,999
and the room would be still.

49
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,999
You'd better deserve those dancing bells she left you.

50
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,999
Very good, Maya.

51
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,958
We are doing the dance of enticement, Tara.

52
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,999
You are the ones with the beautiful
eyes, so, play with them.

53
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,999
You have to mesmerize with them.

54
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,958
Don't give up, princess Tara.

55
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,999
Come on, come on. Try.

56
00:07:34,057 --> 00:07:35,257
Wonderful.

57
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,040
Beautiful dancing, Maya.

58
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,958
Come, my princess Tara.

59
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,999
My darling.

60
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,999
This is for you.

61
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,958
New clothes? For me? I've never had new clothes.

62
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,999
Thank you, Sahib.

63
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Tara.

64
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:15,958
How is it?

65
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,999
Looks like leftovers.

66
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,999
You can wear it at my wedding.

67
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,999
I am going to be married to the great Raj Singh.

68
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:41,958
Such a tender flower,

69
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,999
still unopened.

70
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:51,999
Women, being of tender nature, want tender beginnings, eh?

71
00:08:53,018 --> 00:08:56,098
The wisdom of the Kamasutra is such,

72
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,439
it teaches us not to rush.

73
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,958
For the first 3 days after marriage, the girl and the boy

74
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,958
should abstain from sexual pleasures.

75
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Oh, yes!

76
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,999
On the 10th night, the King will begin gentle love play

77
00:09:11,999 --> 00:09:13,119
to create confidence in you.

78
00:09:13,161 --> 00:09:17,119
He will embrace you with the
upper part of his body in darkness,

79
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,320
because he doesn't know you well.

80
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,999
You should at this time accept his embrace,

81
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,999
and allow him to put betel nut in your...

82
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:31,641
mouth.

83
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,999
God bless the alliance of our two kingdoms.

84
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:50,040
Now let's see if the King's bride
is worth her weight in gold.

85
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,999
He's coming.

86
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,999
He's so young.

87
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,040
Small price to pay for such beauty.

88
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,999
Let's hope she's worth it.

89
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,958
Tara, he likes you.

90
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Go to your room.

91
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,958
And when will this flower open? Oh, my.

92
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,999
I wait upon that night.

93
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,040
And what a night that will be.

94
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,040
Please come. Please come. Come here.

95
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
- Masi.
- Oh, Maya.

96
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:33,958
That's her.

97
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,999
There she is. My lotus woman.

98
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,999
Maybe that was my padmini.

99
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I found her.

100
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,999
- I lost her.
- Seeing things again?

101
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:46,958
- What says the doctor?
- Examining, examining.

102
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,040
Pulse tells all.

103
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Hey, Maya.

104
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Maya.

105
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,958
Easy on those sweets.

106
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,999
That's hot stuff.

107
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,040
Aphrodisiacs.

108
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,999
Put one in my mouth, Maya.

109
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,999
Open your mouth and close your eyes.

110
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Yes?

111
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,999
Forgive me for disturbing you, great King.

112
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Your name?

113
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:32,999
Maya.

114
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,999
Could you be anything but Maya?

115
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,999
I've brought you something.

116
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,999
Some malida to sweeten your tongue.

117
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,999
This is all I need.

118
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,999
This is all I need to sweeten my tongue.

119
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Tara...

120
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,958
You're leaving us forever.

121
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Tara!

122
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,999
Ma. Ma. Ma...

123
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,999
Please get Maya for me.

124
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,999
I want to marry her.

125
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,999
This is for you, Maya.

126
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Tara...

127
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:14,999
All my life I have lived with your used things.

128
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,999
But now...

129
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,999
something I have used is yours forever.

130
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,958
<i>Maya!</i>

131
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,958
- Maya.
- I'll leave this place forever!

132
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Maya.

133
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,040
Maya, listen to me. Listen to me.

134
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:26,999
Think about it.

135
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,999
Biki loves you.

136
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,958
You'll be almost like Tara.

137
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,958
You a princess, and she, a Queen.

138
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,958
I'm supposed to just say yes to everything?

139
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,999
To Tara's clothes, to her used
dowry, and now to her brother?

140
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,999
It's our destiny, Maya.

141
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,999
I'll make my own destiny, masi.

142
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,999
Please.

143
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:59,040
Let me be.

144
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:04,958
She said no?

145
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Thank god.

146
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,968
I could never show my face.

147
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:12,999
Daughter marries King, son marries servant girl.

148
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Come, ma.

149
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,040
Come, ma!

150
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,040
You whore!

151
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Please!

152
00:20:48,042 --> 00:20:51,942
Is this what I taught? Is this what I taught?

153
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,999
Please, I beg of you, no.

154
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Biki.

155
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,999
I'm so sorry.

156
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Maya.

157
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,999
Masi... oh.

158
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,999
You should better go, my pagli.

159
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,958
- Your mother's blessings are with you.
- Go!

160
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,958
And take these bells with you,

161
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,999
so the world will know the whore is coming!

162
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,999
For the blood.

163
00:23:40,958 --> 00:23:41,958
I know about the blood.

164
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,958
Just put it underneath you at the time of the pain.

165
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
What pain?

166
00:23:47,042 --> 00:23:48,058
Tell her.

167
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,958
Just like the tearing of a back tooth.

168
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,040
One moment there, one moment gone.

169
00:24:00,899 --> 00:24:01,899
Enough.

170
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:03,999
She is ready for you, my son.

171
00:24:04,041 --> 00:24:06,999
Your good luck charm.

172
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,999
One day you are your father's property,

173
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,999
next day you are your husband's property.

174
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,999
Must be difficult.

175
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,999
Why not put that around me?

176
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,958
I will not do it again if you embrace me.

177
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,040
I cannot.

178
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,999
You can.

179
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
You even want to.

180
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:43,958
No. Please.

181
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,968
I will press the marks of my teeth
and nails into your breasts,

182
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:48,958
and I will say I found you this way,

183
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,999
and that another man had done it.

184
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,999
And what will you say then?

185
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,999
I will say I am innocent.

186
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,999
Who will believe you?

187
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Maya.

188
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,958
Maya?

189
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,999
You just called me Maya.

190
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,999
- Are you trying to read my mind?
- No.

191
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,999
Did they not prepare you?

192
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,999
Didn't they tell you never to question your husband?

193
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
No!

194
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,999
Get me the chief courtesan!

195
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,999
My name is Jai. Jai Kumar.

196
00:29:08,041 --> 00:29:11,040
I am the royal sculptor, and
I saw you at the King's wedding.

197
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:16,999
You don't know this, but you inspire my work.

198
00:29:19,041 --> 00:29:22,999
I work in stone, like these temples.

199
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,958
It's hard to believe she's made of stone.

200
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Why?

201
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,040
Stone has life.

202
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,999
Padmini.

203
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,999
It's not right.

204
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,999
Don't move.

205
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,083
Maya!

206
00:31:17,326 --> 00:31:18,341
Maya!

207
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,958
I'm sorry.

208
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,958
Let me explain.

209
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,999
I work with my hands.

210
00:31:33,041 --> 00:31:35,999
I didn't want to frighten you or embarrass you.

211
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,040
Why do you feel so free to touch me?

212
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,999
And don't talk to me as if I was
your servant. I'm not your servant.

213
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,999
A servant is a master in disguise.

214
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Where do you live?

215
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,040
Come, I'll walk you home.

216
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,999
You do have a home to go to?

217
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,958
Listen, I know somewhere.
If you agree, I can take you there.

218
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,958
She is wonderful. She teaches the Kamasutra.

219
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,040
Everything I'm trying to understand
about love in my work, she knows.

220
00:32:22,782 --> 00:32:24,782
Let me take you to her.

221
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,958
When you dance the dance of enticement for a man,

222
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,999
you dance like he's the only one left in the world.

223
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,958
Come on. Come on, try.

224
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Play.

225
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,140
Rasa.

226
00:33:29,041 --> 00:33:30,958
Jai Kumar.

227
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,999
And to what do we owe this honor?

228
00:33:34,041 --> 00:33:36,999
This is Maya. A new friend.

229
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,958
She needs a place to stay.

230
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,999
Come, Maya. Join us.

231
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,040
Play.

232
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,968
So Tara was being weighed in gold, and she insulted me

233
00:33:58,010 --> 00:33:59,958
before the King, so I...

234
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,999
You what?

235
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,460
I went to the King's chamber,

236
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:08,999
and I gave myself to him, the night of his wedding.

237
00:34:10,999 --> 00:34:12,319
Oh. Was he as good as his father?

238
00:34:12,361 --> 00:34:14,958
Oh, Rasa Devi, the fuss, the shame.

239
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,040
Shame?

240
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,958
Now, that is an ancient word.

241
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,999
When the King I served as chief courtesan went to war,

242
00:34:22,041 --> 00:34:24,958
the Queen, being the dutiful wife she was,

243
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,999
washed his feet with holy water.

244
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,999
She drank the same water every day he was gone.

245
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,040
When he came back...

246
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,999
he rode straight to my door.

247
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,999
Do you think that honored the Queen?

248
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,958
Honor and shame

249
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,999
may be two sides of the same coin.

250
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,999
It's so beautiful here.

251
00:34:50,041 --> 00:34:52,999
You are welcome to live with us here, Maya.

252
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,957
I prepare the girls.

253
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,999
Some become courtesans in the King's harem.

254
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,040
Others become wives.

255
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,999
I teach my girls the Kamasutra,

256
00:35:02,041 --> 00:35:05,999
that the art of love is much more than the act itself.

257
00:35:06,958 --> 00:35:07,958
Come.

258
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Rest.

259
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,999
You have it in you to be a great courtesan, Maya.

260
00:35:36,041 --> 00:35:38,999
- Reserved maybe for Raj Singh himself.
- The King?

261
00:35:39,958 --> 00:35:40,958
And why not?

262
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,958
No, Rasa Devi, never.

263
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Hush.

264
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,958
We shall not speak of it again.

265
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,999
You stay here as a daughter.

266
00:35:49,041 --> 00:35:53,999
And if you change your mind... you come tell me.

267
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,958
I used to worship inside temples...

268
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,999
until I saw that everything around me was holy:

269
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,040
the waterfall,

270
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
stone,

271
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
grass.

272
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,999
All pure spirit.

273
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,999
Now, like a madman,

274
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,999
I worship everything I see...

275
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,040
like you.

276
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,958
There's a story told

277
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,958
about the neighboring King and his favorite courtesan.

278
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,999
This courtesan became pregnant
at the same time as his Queen.

279
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,999
She gave birth to a son a few days
before the Queen had a daughter.

280
00:37:13,041 --> 00:37:15,968
The courtesan knew that her son would be considered

281
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:17,999
a threat to the throne, so...

282
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
the eunuchs would be dispatched to kill her child.

283
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,999
She was determined to save him.

284
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,999
It was Diwali,

285
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,958
and the potters came to gift their vessels.

286
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,999
Suddenly, the courtesan had an idea. She...

287
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,999
begged one of the potters to smuggle
her baby out in an unused urn.

288
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,999
Did the courtesan see her son again?

289
00:37:43,041 --> 00:37:44,999
Yes, she did.

290
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,968
Every few years the boy would be dressed as a girl and

291
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:50,958
smuggled into the inner court.

292
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Why?

293
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,999
Men can't enter the harem.

294
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,999
So they dressed the boy up,

295
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,999
and his mother would take him along secret passages.

296
00:38:05,041 --> 00:38:07,999
They would spend a few hours together.

297
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,999
Then he would be smuggled out...

298
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,958
and the courtesan knew that it would be

299
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,040
some time before she saw her child again.

300
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,999
A few years later she died.

301
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,999
Maya, come.

302
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,958
And this position is called...

303
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,040
Twining of the Creeper.

304
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,999
Now we add to this what the
Kamasutra calls the Throbbing Kiss.

305
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,968
And this is the way for both lovers to have the pleasure

306
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:26,999
of kissing the lower lip at the same time.

307
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
This was gentle.

308
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,958
What about when love feels intense?

309
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,999
On the first union, for example, or when...

310
00:39:38,041 --> 00:39:40,958
angry lovers are reconciled?

311
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,999
Or when one is intoxicated and full of energy?

312
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,999
How can we express our passion then?

313
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,999
Called by the Kamasutra...

314
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,999
"The Blade of the Saw."

315
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,968
A woman who sees the marks
of her lover's nails on her body

316
00:39:57,010 --> 00:39:58,999
becomes excited again.

317
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,999
Always remember, there should be variety in love sport.

318
00:40:27,041 --> 00:40:31,040
Jai, your padmani's there.

319
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,999
There, there. She's been waiting for hours. Go.

320
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,999
I forgot to return this to you the other day.

321
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,999
You touch me, and I don't know
if it's about your work or...

322
00:41:45,999 --> 00:41:46,999
About what?

323
00:41:47,041 --> 00:41:51,040
Something else. Don't ask me to name it.

324
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,958
Is what you do different from them,

325
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,999
from the men in the street?

326
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,958
You're the same as them, aren't you?

327
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,999
You're accusing me of being the same as those men?

328
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,999
I'll take you somewhere tonight,
and you can see for yourself.

329
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,040
But you will have to dress like a man.

330
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,999
Examining. Examining.

331
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,040
Leave. I'm going in as a commoner.

332
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,999
Can I have some wine?

333
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,858
Kumar.

334
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:17,958
Sahib?

335
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
You don't know me, Kumar.

336
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,958
Tonight, I'm one of you.

337
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,999
Come here, you.

338
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,999
There is joy in 3 things:

339
00:43:28,041 --> 00:43:33,999
Eating meat, riding meat, and putting meat into meat.

340
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,999
I need a woman.

341
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,640
Chandra Bai, can you get me a young one?

342
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,958
May I entreat you to see a special flower of mine?

343
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,958
A virgin as yet unknown to men.

344
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,999
I had a virgin not so long ago.

345
00:43:53,041 --> 00:43:55,958
A strange girl with a face like a Queen.

346
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,999
Sometimes, I still long for her.

347
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,958
All the way from the Himalayas.

348
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,999
Padmini herself.

349
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,999
A fresh rose of the gutter to bloom only for you.

350
00:44:43,041 --> 00:44:45,999
Almost the face of a Queen.

351
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,999
I'll take her.

352
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,999
Enjoying? Huh?

353
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,999
Oh, Rasa!

354
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,958
You have seen how some men can be like animals.

355
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,999
But it is not all men.

356
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,999
I don't believe Jai Kumar is like that.

357
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,999
And since when is woman simply a helpless animal?

358
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,958
Just like men, we are awake and filled with longing.

359
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,999
- But...
- No buts.

360
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,958
Passion remains the spirit behind existence, Maya.

361
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,999
Nothing will ever change that.

362
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,999
It's how we use our passion that is of essence.

363
00:45:51,041 --> 00:45:54,040
Now we must listen to what Kamasutra teaches,

364
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,040
that the true union between man and woman

365
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,958
can take us beyond this animal lust into total trust

366
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,958
and merging with the other, where each becomes both.

367
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,999
Imagine such bliss.

368
00:46:37,041 --> 00:46:40,958
The story you told me about the courtesan and her son,

369
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,999
it was you, wasn't it?

370
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,040
Jai.

371
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:31,999
I made some coconut rice for you.

372
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,040
I know you don't usually eat when you work.

373
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,958
Something's wrong.

374
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,999
What is it? Tell me.

375
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,040
I'm working differently.

376
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,999
But that's good, isn't it?

377
00:49:50,041 --> 00:49:52,040
She's beautiful.

378
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,999
Something about being with you has...

379
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,999
When I work, I see you all the time.

380
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,240
You're with me at every moment.

381
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,040
Is that all you see in me, your work,

382
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,958
a piece of stone?

383
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,099
What if I can't work properly without you?

384
00:50:21,141 --> 00:50:23,940
- You don't have to. We can work together.
- No.

385
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,040
I've never needed anyone.
I've never needed to rely on anyone.

386
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,999
We can't be together.

387
00:50:42,041 --> 00:50:44,999
Don't fall in love with me.

388
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,040
You were the one that talked about love all the time.

389
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:08,999
And now it's facing you, you run from it.

390
00:51:46,041 --> 00:51:49,999
Sometimes things don't make sense immediately.

391
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,958
I have known him a few years now.

392
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,999
He is used to being alone.

393
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,858
Be patient, Maya.

394
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:04,958
Be patient.

395
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,999
I loved being with him.

396
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,958
I would have done anything just to be with him.

397
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:17,999
What kind of love are you talking about? Real love?

398
00:52:18,041 --> 00:52:23,999
If you're looking for real love,
you've chosen the hardest task of all.

399
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,999
The work for which all other work is but preparation.

400
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,999
But... I was ready.

401
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,999
I wanted to give myself to him.

402
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,999
Love does not mean surrendering, losing yourself.

403
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,958
It is a call to ripen.

404
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,999
Don't look for straight lines, Maya.

405
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,999
Life is never like that.

406
00:52:55,041 --> 00:52:57,958
I want to understand properly, Rasa Devi.

407
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,999
I want to learn about the rules
of love and how to apply them.

408
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,999
And if I can't use them on the one I love...

409
00:53:07,041 --> 00:53:09,999
I'll use them on the ones I don't.

410
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,040
Teach me. I'm ready.

411
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,958
At all times and in all countries,

412
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:23,999
there's ever been a little rivalry
between the chaste and the unchaste.

413
00:53:24,041 --> 00:53:27,958
But while some women are born courtesans, let's face it,

414
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,658
every woman has got an inkling
of the profession in her nature

415
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:33,999
and makes herself agreeable to the other sex.

416
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,958
One of the arts of the courtesan

417
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:41,958
is that while she involves herself in sex without love,

418
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,999
she conducts herself as if love were indeed natural,

419
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:51,999
because we all know that men love
women who apparently love them.

420
00:53:52,041 --> 00:53:55,958
But even courtesans should not
always be welcoming, because...

421
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,978
we must know that men are apt to despise things that

422
00:53:59,020 --> 00:54:00,999
are easily acquired.

423
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,958
You can hear all these rules,

424
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,999
but remember, once the wheel of love is set in motion...

425
00:54:11,041 --> 00:54:14,999
there are no rules and no order.

426
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:25,040
Salute the day! Salute the hills and flowers!

427
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Enough.

428
00:54:43,041 --> 00:54:44,999
Is this the statue?

429
00:54:53,958 --> 00:54:54,958
Whose is this?

430
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,040
It's mine, Sahib.

431
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Yours, Kumar?

432
00:55:05,041 --> 00:55:09,999
So imbued is this stone with the warmth of woman.

433
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,999
I want to kiss the skin.

434
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,040
I have kissed the skin.

435
00:55:26,041 --> 00:55:28,999
I have kissed this skin.

436
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Who is she?

437
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,958
- A young woman I found.
- Bring her to me.

438
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:39,999
I wish I could, Sahib, but she disappeared.

439
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,999
Then we must find her.

440
00:55:43,141 --> 00:55:44,141
Yes, Sahib.

441
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,957
As a reward for your most excellent work, Kumar,

442
00:55:47,999 --> 00:55:49,499
you shall wrestle me.

443
00:55:49,541 --> 00:55:51,958
Vazir, pay the man his weight in gold.

444
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Sahib.

445
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Sing.

446
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,040
You made her wait.

447
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,999
Now you will have to wait.

448
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,958
Listen! Listen!

449
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:17,958
We are looking for the woman who inspired Jai Kumar.

450
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,999
Her skin, the color of freshly harvested wheat,

451
00:57:21,041 --> 00:57:24,958
her limbs long and languorous

452
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,999
like the creeper.

453
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,999
Thank you.

454
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,999
Are you ready, my precious child?

455
00:58:03,041 --> 00:58:04,999
I'm frightened.

456
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,040
I was frightened, too, the day they came for me.

457
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,958
It is good to be a little frightened,

458
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:16,999
because it means you feel things.

459
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Come.

460
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,958
Another courtesan, my Queen.

461
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Name?

462
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Maya.

463
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,999
Maya?

464
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,040
Enough!

465
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Tara!

466
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,040
How long do you expect to languish?

467
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,000
All day?

468
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,999
I was longing to see you.

469
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Get out!

470
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,040
My son has an eye.

471
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,999
I trained him.

472
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,958
Yours?

473
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,999
Of course.

474
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,999
'Tis the usual custom.

475
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,999
The usual custom no longer applies.

476
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:28,999
If a courtesan is not elegantly attired,

477
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,999
she will not exhilarate my husband.

478
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,999
Exhilaration is my department.

479
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:40,999
You get me something new, or
we will keep your husband waiting.

480
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,999
And I'm sure I will be blamed for it.

481
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,500
He is full of lust, and she is in the eye.

482
01:00:48,550 --> 01:00:51,999
Get her something new and quickly, Tara.

483
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,999
Sahib?

484
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,958
What news from the stars?

485
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:10,040
There is news of the Shah, Sahib.

486
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,000
Later.

487
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,999
Tell me the stars.

488
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:21,958
Jupiter, the sign of good fortune,
is placed in your house of love and marriage.

489
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,999
An auspicious time for love.

490
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Good.

491
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:32,999
Sahib, we must speak.

492
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,999
I said later.

493
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,958
Vazir, matters of state are your affair.

494
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,999
As love is mine.

495
01:02:36,857 --> 01:02:37,857
Adjust.

496
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,999
Adjust, my child.

497
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,958
It's an old story.

498
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,040
He had her on your wedding night,

499
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,999
just the way Rasa had my husband.

500
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,958
There are courtesans, and then there are wives.

501
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,999
There are dozens like her.

502
01:03:06,041 --> 01:03:09,999
But you are Queen.

503
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,999
The glory of god is in you.

504
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,958
Oh, it was a good night.

505
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:27,040
Kumar, whose artistry pleases my gods,

506
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,999
whatever you've heard, in the ring, we're equal.

507
01:05:34,958 --> 01:05:35,958
With or without claws?

508
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,999
I can be lethal enough without them.

509
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,000
Good.

510
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,999
You do that again, you'll have no arms.

511
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,999
Forgive me, Sahib.

512
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,040
Good fight, Kumar.

513
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,958
We have some work to discuss.

514
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,040
Will you join me tonight?

515
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,999
People say I think too much about women.

516
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,040
What is there more important to think about?

517
01:07:14,999 --> 01:07:15,999
To our great King,

518
01:07:16,041 --> 01:07:18,040
who started off a great warrior,

519
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,958
and ended as an insect sucking on a poppy flower.

520
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,058
Vazir.

521
01:07:23,100 --> 01:07:24,958
Captured.

522
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:26,458
You draw the fleeting moment.

523
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:28,099
Show me the eternal.

524
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,999
You did make love to Maya, then?

525
01:07:37,958 --> 01:07:38,958
You know her name?

526
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,958
I know everything.

527
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:42,958
Answer me.

528
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,999
I'm waiting.

529
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,999
Work can only be an act of love.

530
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:53,558
You will go to China to fetch another,
you clumsy son of a whore!

531
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:54,999
Yes, Sahib. Right away.

532
01:07:58,041 --> 01:08:00,999
I have found your girl, Kumar.

533
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,999
Sit, sit.

534
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:10,999
I tell you she governs me and winds me up at a whim.

535
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:14,999
My moods depend on her.

536
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:19,999
I want to open my eyes to her under me...

537
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,999
in the morning.

538
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:30,040
You should be given an audience with her, Kumar.

539
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,999
I want you to carve her across the roof of my room.

540
01:08:37,041 --> 01:08:41,040
But if I was god, I'd carve her
across the bright blue sky.

541
01:08:52,999 --> 01:08:53,999
Poison.

542
01:08:54,041 --> 01:08:55,958
Bitter as bile.

543
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:59,999
But when taken from childhood,
it makes you immune from enemies.

544
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,999
My Raj.

545
01:09:59,957 --> 01:10:01,957
All my life, I've lived with your used things.

546
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,958
Now all your life, you'll use mine.

547
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,958
So...

548
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,958
tell me, are you happy now?

549
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,999
Tara...

550
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,999
I was young.

551
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:26,999
I had no idea then that what I did that
night would change your life forever...

552
01:10:27,999 --> 01:10:28,999
and mine, too.

553
01:10:29,041 --> 01:10:31,999
You got what you wanted.

554
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,999
He desires you.

555
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,958
At least one of us is happy.

556
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,958
Do you think that just because the
King desires me, it makes me happy?

557
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,958
Does it not?

558
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:48,040
No, Tara, it does not.

559
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,999
Sometimes...

560
01:10:59,041 --> 01:11:02,999
when I catch a glimpse of the world outside...

561
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,958
trees,

562
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,999
sky...

563
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:21,999
I wish we were free like when we were children.

564
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,999
Tara.

565
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,999
You meet again.

566
01:11:47,041 --> 01:11:49,999
Enchanted.

567
01:11:51,958 --> 01:11:52,958
What shall I do?

568
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,040
Will you dance?

569
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:28,999
I like this position.

570
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:34,999
I did not agree to sculpting by committee, Sahib.

571
01:12:36,041 --> 01:12:40,999
Allow me the honor of a... an artist's privacy.

572
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,999
Maya...

573
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:14,999
I love you.

574
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,999
You love only yourself.

575
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:28,999
How naive of me.

576
01:13:52,415 --> 01:13:53,415
Maya.

577
01:13:53,958 --> 01:13:54,958
Maya.

578
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:58,999
Forgive me, please. I was afraid of losing control.

579
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,999
Maya.

580
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,999
You hurt me.

581
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:16,958
I belong to him now.

582
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:18,000
No.

583
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,999
I belong to you.

584
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:43,999
I made a mistake.

585
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,999
Take me back.

586
01:15:03,041 --> 01:15:04,041
Jai.

587
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:27,040
I marry you. You marry me.

588
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:37,999
I marry you.

589
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,999
You marry me.

590
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:21,958
Dr. Mani, we believe Queen Tara is hysterical.

591
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,040
We found her flushed and without breath.

592
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,958
Her body does not keep from twisting.

593
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:30,999
Have the spirits possessed her? I want to know.

594
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Her heart, please.

595
01:16:54,041 --> 01:16:55,041
So?

596
01:16:55,999 --> 01:16:56,999
Her pulse...

597
01:16:57,041 --> 01:16:58,999
it's normal.

598
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,999
Examining. Examining.

599
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:36,999
Sahib.

600
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,958
It seems the opium has made you half a man.

601
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:50,958
You cannot pass her over.

602
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:54,958
I've heard rumors that her own
brother is being courted by the Shah.

603
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:58,958
Invaders like the Shah, with or without that
hunchback, are no match for my strength.

604
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:03,758
It is not you that are strong.
It is your neighbors that are weak.

605
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:04,958
The gods protect me.

606
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:06,999
I will show you. Biki is nothing.

607
01:18:07,041 --> 01:18:09,299
- Just show me an heir from the Queen...
- Nothing!

608
01:18:09,341 --> 01:18:11,999
...before I get a bastard from one of your whores!

609
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,958
Sweet brother-in-law, this is your home.

610
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,040
You can have anything you want.

611
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,999
Now, what can I offer you?

612
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,000
More music?

613
01:18:28,041 --> 01:18:30,958
- Oh. Boys.
- Boys? Do you insult me?

614
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:34,458
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

615
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:37,999
Or is it time you had women?

616
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,999
I always wanted women...

617
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,999
ever since I... ha ha... stood up.

618
01:18:46,041 --> 01:18:47,958
Women?

619
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:49,958
Certainly, women you shall have.

620
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:53,958
You shall have the pick of my harem. How many do you want?

621
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:55,000
Three?

622
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,000
Four?

623
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,360
Don't worry, we'll blindfold them.

624
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,999
And tie up their hands as well.

625
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,958
<i>"I write this in the interest of the people,</i>

626
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,999
<i>who are being neglected by a debauched King."</i>

627
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,958
- Now take this to the Shah.
- Sahib.

628
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,958
<i>"He has insulted my sister</i>

629
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:33,958
<i>"and squeezes the common folk
each day, to feed his appetites.</i>

630
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:38,958
<i>"He has put his affairs entirely in the
hands of his prime minister, the vazir.</i>

631
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:42,958
<i>"I put myself in your royal hands as an ally.</i>

632
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,999
<i>Prince Bikram Singh."</i>

633
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,499
I want to be alone.

634
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,999
- I want to be alone with you.
- Raj.

635
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:11,999
Just you and I... together.

636
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,999
Let me lie in your arms.

637
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,999
<i>Give me some comfort.</i>

638
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,958
Oh, please.

639
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,999
What?

640
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,999
I cannot.

641
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,040
Do you think you're the only woman?

642
01:22:04,041 --> 01:22:09,999
- I have hundreds waiting.
- Go to them.

643
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,999
Once you wanted me.

644
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,999
I serviced you, that's all.

645
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,999
You have no power over me.

646
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:30,999
Go.

647
01:22:38,041 --> 01:22:40,999
Go now.

648
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:59,999
My love.

649
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,999
- Oh, my love.
- I can't continue this way.

650
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:12,999
This is the last time I sneak in like some rat!

651
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,999
I'm his courtesan, that's all.

652
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:39,999
Beautiful women are a law unto themselves.

653
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:45,999
I no longer have any authority over her.

654
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:50,999
Life is strange.

655
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:58,999
Fight me.

656
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,040
Fight me, Kumar!

657
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:07,999
I want to sweat...

658
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:10,999
Claws!

659
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,999
...and bleed.

660
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:22,999
Opium!

661
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:45,087
Strike!

662
01:24:47,230 --> 01:24:48,241
Strike!

663
01:25:19,083 --> 01:25:20,283
No!

664
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,999
Why did you do this?

665
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,040
I cannot stand this anymore.

666
01:25:45,041 --> 01:25:46,999
Because I love you,

667
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,999
my work has a power that even I cannot explain.

668
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,999
What do I work for?

669
01:26:00,041 --> 01:26:02,999
To arouse this King of ours?

670
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:05,999
We leave tonight.

671
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,999
As soon as it's dark we'll find a way out.

672
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,999
Where's the whore with the heart of a vulture?

673
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:20,999
Where is she?

674
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:31,999
Were you invited?

675
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:37,040
I didn't ask him in, my love. Did you?

676
01:26:38,041 --> 01:26:39,999
You.

677
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:43,958
You offend me.

678
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:45,958
It is a crime to offend your ruler.

679
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:47,058
Ruler?

680
01:26:47,100 --> 01:26:49,999
You reign, Sahib. You do not rule.

681
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:54,999
You will die, Kumar.

682
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,999
You will die like the bastard commoner you are!

683
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,958
Take him away to the valley of stones.

684
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:03,000
No!

685
01:27:14,042 --> 01:27:15,042
No!

686
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:52,999
What are you going to do?

687
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,099
What am I going to do?

688
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:02,199
Tara!

689
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:08,999
I hate you.

690
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:18,958
All my life you hated me!

691
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,958
You could have finished me off, but you didn't!

692
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:23,999
You know why?

693
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:26,958
Because I survived you.

694
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:28,999
I wanted to live.

695
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:33,958
Now you better survive me...

696
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:35,000
and your husband...

697
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,999
and anything else that happens to hurt you.

698
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:02,999
They took him.

699
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:06,999
Who?

700
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:11,699
Jai Kumar.

701
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,540
You love Jai Kumar?

702
01:30:58,041 --> 01:31:01,999
We shall not surrender to despair.

703
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,999
This is really not so difficult.

704
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:10,999
I can show you how to dress.

705
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,599
I can show you how to mark him and touch him.

706
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,499
Men are not such a mystery.

707
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:23,840
First, I will mark you.

708
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,999
He will know a woman made these marks.

709
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,999
It will excite him.

710
01:31:53,041 --> 01:31:59,140
Maya, Jai is going to be killed, and I cannot stop it.

711
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,999
I will help you see him.

712
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:25,040
Now is the time.

713
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:27,999
The doctor will help you.

714
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:37,999
Thank you.

715
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,999
Our deepest gratitude, doctor.

716
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:05,040
Vazir?

717
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:08,000
Who is it?

718
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:11,999
Speak up.

719
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:16,999
Greetings, Raj.

720
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:22,999
Tara?

721
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,999
Maya's taught you well.

722
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:23,999
In the end... it always comes down to the wife.

723
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,999
The mark of a tiger's nail.

724
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:14,999
You are common to many women.

725
01:35:15,041 --> 01:35:19,999
I would see you always... so aroused by others...

726
01:35:20,041 --> 01:35:23,999
undressing them with your eyes.

727
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:27,958
How I loved you then.

728
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:29,999
And how I anguished.

729
01:35:30,041 --> 01:35:32,040
You do hate me.

730
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:38,999
No, Raj. I do not love you enough to hate you.

731
01:36:32,598 --> 01:36:33,598
Jai?

732
01:36:38,040 --> 01:36:39,040
Jai.

733
01:36:52,041 --> 01:36:54,999
Embrace me, my love.

734
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:17,040
You have to be very brave, my love.

735
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,999
They take you tomorrow.

736
01:37:23,041 --> 01:37:26,999
And I will be with you always.

737
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:30,999
Always.

738
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:44,000
Maya.

739
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,999
Bind me to you with this hair forever.

740
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:26,999
I am yours.

741
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:31,040
Take me.

742
01:38:32,041 --> 01:38:36,999
Cut this hair. It's yours.

743
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:56,999
My flower.

744
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:01,999
Jai... you have my heart.

745
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:25,040
I love you.

746
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,999
You came back for me.

747
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,958
Even like this, I want you.

748
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:32,999
You have me.

749
01:40:38,041 --> 01:40:41,040
But I ask only one thing.

750
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:44,999
Please free him.

751
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:51,999
Please?

752
01:40:56,000 --> 01:41:00,999
Please. I'm begging you. Please.

753
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:03,999
I will do anything.

754
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,040
No! I want more than this!

755
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:14,999
I want your heart.

756
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,799
In your heart, please, give him up.

757
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:23,999
If you free him.

758
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:34,999
If I free him, you must never see his face again.

759
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:43,040
Swear it on your mother's name.

760
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:46,899
I swear it.

761
01:42:02,041 --> 01:42:03,999
You're a lying whore!

762
01:42:04,041 --> 01:42:08,999
Jai Kumar will die! And I will watch him die!

763
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:33,000
Sahib!

764
01:42:39,357 --> 01:42:40,357
Sahib.

765
01:42:41,300 --> 01:42:42,340
Sahib.

766
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:46,999
A box was left at the gate with a message from the Shah.

767
01:42:47,800 --> 01:42:48,857
He...

768
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:50,600
He has entered our Kingdom, Sahib.

769
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,999
His troops are advancing upon us.

770
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:10,000
Vazir.

771
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:19,999
Call the Queen!

772
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:54,999
Comfort me.

773
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:08,999
I need some comfort.

774
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,999
Maya!

775
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:08,958
<i>Knowing love,</i>

776
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,958
<i>I will allow all things to come and go...</i>

777
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,999
<i>to be as supple as the wind...</i>

778
01:46:15,041 --> 01:46:18,041
<i>and take everything that comes with great courage.</i>

779
01:46:19,041 --> 01:46:21,558
<i>As Rasa would say to me:</i>

780
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,599
<i>"Life is right in any case."</i>

781
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,940
<i>My heart is as open as the sky.</i>
