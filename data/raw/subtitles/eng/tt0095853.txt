746
00:53:29,734 --> 00:53:31,273
Sometimes...

747
00:53:31,853 --> 00:53:33,255
David would be playing,

748
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:36,320
and I'd be singing with him

749
00:53:36,413 --> 00:53:38,182
at the piano.

750
00:53:42,386 --> 00:53:44,154
Where was I?

751
00:53:45,110 --> 00:53:47,853
Outside the fence
signing autographs?

752
00:53:55,932 --> 00:53:59,103
Was there something I could've done?

753
00:54:01,938 --> 00:54:04,182
You want some advice?

754
00:54:04,369 --> 00:54:06,830
Don't ask yourself that.

755
00:54:06,925 --> 00:54:09,795
I know, because I tried.

756
00:54:10,014 --> 00:54:12,282
And there ain't no answer.

757
00:54:15,845 --> 00:54:17,181
What are you doing?

758
00:54:17,256 --> 00:54:18,688
Hey, Lauren,
get back.

759
00:54:18,787 --> 00:54:21,756
I'm okay. I just want
to know the feeling.

760
00:54:21,891 --> 00:54:23,177
Lauren,
get back! Now!

761
00:54:23,247 --> 00:54:25,201
How could you?

762
00:54:25,343 --> 00:54:28,046
You bastard!

763
00:54:28,858 --> 00:54:30,400
No playing around.

764
00:54:30,513 --> 00:54:32,632
No teasing or
tempting the fates, get it?

765
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:34,905
Not with me here,
you don't!

766
00:54:35,585 --> 00:54:37,202
And there's no figuring it out.

767
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:39,528
He blew it!
That's all!

768
00:54:42,179 --> 00:54:45,215
We will never know.

769
00:54:50,187 --> 00:54:51,655
It's too late...

770
00:54:52,437 --> 00:54:53,590
Right?

771
00:54:53,874 --> 00:54:55,515
God damn right.

772
00:55:08,090 --> 00:55:09,424
Come on.

773
00:55:19,850 --> 00:55:23,264
We'd like to have the
service here at school.

774
00:55:23,741 --> 00:55:26,897
Um...
David wasn't happy

775
00:55:26,922 --> 00:55:28,593
with most of the stuff he wrote,

776
00:55:28,664 --> 00:55:31,661
but... there's one song

777
00:55:31,692 --> 00:55:33,336
I know he wouldn't mind if we played.

778
00:55:33,891 --> 00:55:34,890
Singing?

779
00:55:35,009 --> 00:55:37,011
No. Uh...

780
00:55:37,567 --> 00:55:39,716
He'd only written a few words to it.

781
00:55:39,811 --> 00:55:41,490
He wasn't really happy with it.

782
00:55:41,601 --> 00:55:42,802
Okay.

783
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:44,302
I'll clear a date.

784
00:55:44,405 --> 00:55:46,541
Thank you very much, sir.

785
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:49,216
T-R-I-G.

786
00:55:49,305 --> 00:55:51,087
T-R-I--

787
00:55:51,251 --> 00:55:52,399
What are you going to do?

788
00:55:52,657 --> 00:55:53,962
Just proving a point.

789
00:55:54,039 --> 00:55:56,017
I can't even spell trigonometry.

790
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:58,259
I can spell it.
I can teach you.

791
00:55:58,342 --> 00:56:00,311
No, Jake. It's okay. Relax.

792
00:56:02,668 --> 00:56:04,879
We're having this service for David.

793
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:06,098
Yeah?

794
00:56:06,205 --> 00:56:08,082
We'll play his music

795
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:10,809
and try to make a good time out of it.

796
00:56:10,855 --> 00:56:12,390
Verdell's setting it up.

797
00:56:13,782 --> 00:56:14,675
I don't know.

798
00:56:14,904 --> 00:56:16,065
You don't know what?

799
00:56:16,208 --> 00:56:18,710
You used to want to help me.

800
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:20,144
Well, I still do.

801
00:56:20,267 --> 00:56:22,002
Okay, so help now.

802
00:56:23,913 --> 00:56:25,131
What I mean is...

803
00:56:25,315 --> 00:56:26,983
This guy kills himself.

804
00:56:27,123 --> 00:56:27,904
I don't know.

805
00:56:28,019 --> 00:56:29,545
What the fuck's the difference?

806
00:56:29,589 --> 00:56:30,991
The guy's gone.

807
00:56:31,577 --> 00:56:34,314
Let's say good-bye to him.

808
00:56:35,448 --> 00:56:37,183
Okay.

809
00:56:37,647 --> 00:56:38,995
Yeah.

810
00:56:39,446 --> 00:56:41,392
Do you ever wonder...

811
00:56:41,941 --> 00:56:44,751
I mean, if David couldn't make it...

812
00:56:45,935 --> 00:56:48,104
I don't know.

813
00:56:52,582 --> 00:56:53,983
[DOOR OPENS]

814
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:55,842
Hello, Leo.

815
00:56:55,908 --> 00:56:58,540
- Dr. Moss. How are you?
- Fine, thanks.

816
00:56:58,596 --> 00:57:00,283
- How is family?
- Fine thank you.

817
00:57:00,322 --> 00:57:02,057
Have a seat, Leo.

818
00:57:02,635 --> 00:57:04,978
Leo, I was in New York last month

819
00:57:05,064 --> 00:57:07,433
on school business,

820
00:57:07,799 --> 00:57:09,744
and I walked across the Brooklyn Bridge.

821
00:57:09,813 --> 00:57:12,088
I was scared to death.

822
00:57:12,924 --> 00:57:15,265
I had to hold on for dear life.

823
00:57:16,891 --> 00:57:18,415
How are your students handling it, Leo?

824
00:57:18,606 --> 00:57:20,008
They don't get it.

825
00:57:20,828 --> 00:57:23,086
He seemed to have
everything going for him,

826
00:57:23,207 --> 00:57:24,516
and then this.

827
00:57:25,573 --> 00:57:27,174
It scares them.

828
00:57:27,644 --> 00:57:29,369
They want to know why.

829
00:57:29,769 --> 00:57:32,238
They're afraid it might happen to them.

830
00:57:33,486 --> 00:57:35,288
And then they realized...

831
00:57:35,928 --> 00:57:37,897
They didn't really know him.

832
00:57:38,665 --> 00:57:41,006
Hell, I thought
I knew him.

833
00:57:43,975 --> 00:57:46,982
When he came into my office
just the other day...

834
00:57:47,744 --> 00:57:49,413
I sensed something.

835
00:57:50,615 --> 00:57:53,937
But I thought he was
just nervous over college

836
00:57:53,937 --> 00:57:55,705
like everyone else.

837
00:57:56,806 --> 00:57:58,686
If he'd only told me.

838
00:57:59,561 --> 00:58:01,631
Maybe he tried.

839
00:58:02,108 --> 00:58:03,256
Maybe that 
was his problem.

840
00:58:03,333 --> 00:58:05,162
He just couldn't.

841
00:58:06,336 --> 00:58:07,938
I hope we can make them understand

842
00:58:08,002 --> 00:58:10,785
sometimes we never know
why these things happen.

843
00:58:12,756 --> 00:58:16,238
Can you get them refocused over there,
get them back on track?

844
00:58:16,803 --> 00:58:19,162
They're planning
a memorial service for him.

845
00:58:19,256 --> 00:58:20,457
Wait, Leo.

846
00:58:20,552 --> 00:58:22,498
That's not such a good idea.

847
00:58:22,642 --> 00:58:25,645
I think it's a very good idea.

848
00:58:26,090 --> 00:58:27,791
They'll play his music.

849
00:58:27,908 --> 00:58:29,343
His music?

850
00:58:30,796 --> 00:58:33,030
What are you talking about?

851
00:58:33,671 --> 00:58:36,552
Let's not make
a hero out of this boy.

852
00:58:36,654 --> 00:58:37,990
We don't want to canonize him

853
00:58:38,053 --> 00:58:39,254
and make it look like

854
00:58:39,332 --> 00:58:40,725
we're condoning his suicide.

855
00:58:40,791 --> 00:58:42,393
That's horseshit, Leo.

856
00:58:43,265 --> 00:58:46,790
I already told them
I'd set it up.

857
00:58:47,585 --> 00:58:50,960
Well, you tell them 
to read the small print.

858
00:58:53,770 --> 00:58:56,039
Good to see you, Leo.

859
00:59:03,598 --> 00:59:05,488
See you, Lauren.

860
00:59:07,616 --> 00:59:10,300
Well, you want to
get out or what?

861
00:59:12,039 --> 00:59:14,234
I don't want to go to work tonight.

862
00:59:14,530 --> 00:59:15,346
So don't.

863
00:59:15,695 --> 00:59:17,320
What will happen
if you don't?

864
00:59:17,377 --> 00:59:18,367
Nothing...

865
00:59:18,445 --> 00:59:19,746
If she's ill.

866
00:59:20,098 --> 00:59:22,100
Tell them it's highly contagious.

867
00:59:22,633 --> 00:59:24,843
Tell them you got 2 billion germs

868
00:59:24,868 --> 00:59:27,179
ready to jump into the lemon chicken.

869
00:59:27,629 --> 00:59:29,497
Ha ha! Ha ha!

870
00:59:29,544 --> 00:59:31,346
Ha ha ha!

871
00:59:35,907 --> 00:59:39,410
Oh, ... 
you're a good guy.

872
00:59:39,574 --> 00:59:42,544
Shh! Don't ever, ever say that.

873
00:59:48,074 --> 00:59:49,019
Oh...

874
00:59:49,104 --> 00:59:51,277
You know that article you're writing

875
00:59:51,310 --> 00:59:52,223
for the paper?

876
00:59:52,267 --> 00:59:54,473
Forget about that.
That's gone.

877
00:59:54,622 --> 00:59:56,723
You might have been right.

878
00:59:56,808 --> 00:59:58,605
No, that was an idea

879
00:59:58,630 --> 01:00:00,347
never should have been born.

880
01:00:00,372 --> 01:00:01,352
Well...

881
01:00:01,488 --> 01:00:04,324
Especially since it
wasn't even an accident.

882
01:00:04,574 --> 01:00:07,666
More the reason maybe to write it, huh?

883
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:09,843

01:00:32,228 --> 01:00:34,531
I want to see you over here.

895
01:00:34,531 --> 01:00:36,466
Marching in formation,

896
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:37,834
and it's great.

897
01:00:37,834 --> 01:00:40,855
Remember to keep space
between the lines...

898
01:00:40,898 --> 01:00:42,467
Three parallel lines...

899
01:00:46,183 --> 01:00:47,948
Could I talk to you a minute?

900
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:48,964
Yeah.

901
01:00:49,061 --> 01:00:50,089
In private?

902
01:00:50,159 --> 01:00:51,288
Sure.

903
01:00:56,634 --> 01:00:57,830
It occurred to me,

904
01:00:57,861 --> 01:00:59,892
if anybody might know something,

905
01:00:59,917 --> 01:01:01,585
it might be you.

906
01:01:02,268 --> 01:01:03,408
About what?

907
01:01:03,691 --> 01:01:05,093
David.

908
01:01:08,939 --> 01:01:11,072
I don't know anything
about why he killed himself,

909
01:01:11,107 --> 01:01:12,205
if that's what you think.

910
01:01:12,346 --> 01:01:14,556
No, no. I'm asking you
to think.

911
01:01:14,814 --> 01:01:16,816
What did he talk about?

912
01:01:17,106 --> 01:01:18,307
Nothing.

913
01:01:18,307 --> 01:01:19,801
What did he say?

914
01:01:19,826 --> 01:01:21,324
Nothing was said.

915
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:23,473
No questions,
no nothing.

916
01:01:23,566 --> 01:01:25,982
Well, he must have said something.

917
01:01:27,763 --> 01:01:29,586
It was just sex,
Chris.

918
01:01:29,663 --> 01:01:31,497
That's all it was.

919
01:01:31,753 --> 01:01:34,084
I'm sorry
I can't help you.

920
01:01:39,796 --> 01:01:41,796
We're having a service for him.

921
01:01:41,837 --> 01:01:43,839
Maybe you'd like to say a few words.

922
01:01:44,339 --> 01:01:46,175
No, I wouldn't.

923
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:47,771
Why not, Kim?

924
01:01:48,090 --> 01:01:51,043
Because it's just not the
kind of thing I do, Chris.

925
01:01:53,485 --> 01:01:55,921
I'm sorry. I just
have nothing to say.

926
01:02:04,854 --> 01:02:06,355
Excuse me.

927
01:02:06,355 --> 01:02:07,757
Excuse me.

928

Well,
it can't happen,

934
01:02:20,904 --> 01:02:24,107
so you'll have to forget about it.

I know 
what I said, Chris.

937
01:02:27,877 --> 01:02:30,379
Now I'm saying
we can't do it.

938
01:02:30,379 --> 01:02:32,302
Why not, Mr. Verdell?

939

Look, everyone.

940

This comes from the top.
That's it.

941
