1
00:00:38,154 --> 00:00:40,556
It was a long time ago.

2
00:00:40,656 --> 00:00:43,559
Sometimes I can still
hear their voices

3
00:00:43,659 --> 00:00:45,062
across Sally's woods.

4
00:00:45,162 --> 00:00:48,799
There was Billy,
Steve, Tommy,

5
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:52,302
and the tall kid from
down the street... Joey.

6
00:00:52,402 --> 00:00:54,304
Yeah, it was
Joey Walsh.

7
00:00:54,404 --> 00:00:56,808
My best friend
was Timmy Burns

8
00:00:56,908 --> 00:00:59,638
who lived two blocks
away from me.

9
00:01:00,812 --> 00:01:03,748
We turned the woods
into a battlefield

10
00:01:03,848 --> 00:01:08,149
and dreamed that someday
we would become men.

11
00:01:15,995 --> 00:01:17,363
Did you hear it?

12
00:01:17,463 --> 00:01:19,261
What?

13
00:01:27,073 --> 00:01:29,564
Let's go, Timmy!
Let's go!

14
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:37,850
Come on, Major!

15
00:01:42,356 --> 00:01:44,593
They've got to be
somewhere, Ronnie.

16
00:01:44,693 --> 00:01:46,183
Watch out.

17
00:01:46,295 --> 00:01:48,964
You've got to stay
in the ravine.

18
00:01:49,064 --> 00:01:50,122
Shh.

19
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,058
Shh.

20
00:01:55,004 --> 00:01:56,806
Go! Go! Go!

21
00:01:56,906 --> 00:01:58,675
Look, there they are!

22
00:01:58,775 --> 00:02:00,543
Wipe them out!

23
00:02:00,643 --> 00:02:02,845
Aah!

24
00:02:02,945 --> 00:02:04,414
Aah!

25
00:02:04,514 --> 00:02:05,615
- Aah!
- Aah!

26
00:02:05,715 --> 00:02:07,384
Aah!

27
00:02:07,484 --> 00:02:09,220
- Aah!
- Aah!

28
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,550
You're dead,
and you know it!

29
00:02:11,655 --> 00:02:13,247
No, I'm not!

30
00:02:13,357 --> 00:02:15,120
Ronnie's dead!

31
00:02:15,225 --> 00:02:17,693
No, I'm not!
No, I'm not!

32
00:02:51,398 --> 00:02:53,066
Look at the mayor.

33
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:55,727
I wonder where your mom is.

34
00:02:58,306 --> 00:03:00,275
Where is that woman?

35
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:02,366
Hey!

36
00:03:03,945 --> 00:03:05,777
Hi.

37
00:03:11,887 --> 00:03:13,989
# 3 o'clock,
4 o'clock rock #

38
00:03:14,089 --> 00:03:15,224
# 5, 6, 7 o'clock #

39
00:03:15,324 --> 00:03:16,392
# 8 o'clock rock #

40
00:03:16,492 --> 00:03:18,927
# 9, 10, 11 o'clock,
12 o'clock rock #

41
00:03:19,028 --> 00:03:21,364
# We're gonna rock
around the clock tonight #

42
00:03:21,464 --> 00:03:22,692
# Put your glad rags on #

43
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:24,067
# And join me, hon #

44
00:03:24,167 --> 00:03:26,469
# We'll have some fun
when the clock strikes 1:00 #

45
00:03:26,569 --> 00:03:29,807
# We're gonna rock around
the clock tonight #

46
00:03:29,907 --> 00:03:30,775
Donna!

47
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:32,276
Donna,
come back here!

48
00:03:32,376 --> 00:03:34,503
Get out of the way!

49
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:38,215
Hey, you boys! Stop that!

50
00:03:38,315 --> 00:03:39,350
# When the band slows down #

51
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:40,686
# We're gonna yell for more #

52
00:03:40,786 --> 00:03:42,387
# We're gonna rock around
the clock tonight ##

53
00:03:42,487 --> 00:03:44,356
Donna! Donna!

54
00:03:44,456 --> 00:03:47,159
Stevie Boyer
just gave Mary Barnett a ring.

55
00:03:47,259 --> 00:03:48,660
Can you believe it?

56
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,195
Over there.

57
00:03:50,295 --> 00:03:51,227
O.K.

58
00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:52,820
Come here,
come here.

59
00:03:52,932 --> 00:03:54,229
What is this?

60
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:55,768
Is this
a firecracker?

61
00:03:55,868 --> 00:03:56,835
What's wrong with you?

62
00:04:00,206 --> 00:04:01,764
Hey!

63
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,836
Hey!

64
00:04:15,857 --> 00:04:17,258
This is boring.

65
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,292
Yeah, square, man.

66
00:04:28,637 --> 00:04:31,128
Look, Daddy,
the soldiers!

67
00:05:19,392 --> 00:05:21,394
Happy birthday,
Ronnie Kovic.

68
00:05:21,494 --> 00:05:22,395
For me?

69
00:05:22,495 --> 00:05:23,897
Yes. Open it.

70
00:05:23,997 --> 00:05:25,398
That's really
nice, Donna.

71
00:05:25,498 --> 00:05:26,901
Say thank you,
Ronnie.

72
00:05:27,001 --> 00:05:30,037
Thanks, Donna, but
you didn't have to.

73
00:05:30,137 --> 00:05:31,832
Going to
the woods tonight?

74
00:05:31,939 --> 00:05:33,307
They'll have
fireworks there.

75
00:05:33,407 --> 00:05:35,342
Should be
a real blast.

76
00:05:35,442 --> 00:05:36,310
Yeah, O.K.

77
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:38,079
What is it?
Open it.

78
00:05:38,179 --> 00:05:39,737
Leave him alone.

79
00:05:40,849 --> 00:05:41,683
Beautiful.

80
00:05:41,783 --> 00:05:44,052
Hey, it's
the real thing, Ronnie.

81
00:05:44,152 --> 00:05:45,520
Feel that.

82
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,355
Just like
Mickey Mantle, Ronnie.

83
00:05:47,455 --> 00:05:49,859
Ain't he
a 4th of July firecracker

84
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:51,327
in that hat?

85
00:05:51,427 --> 00:05:55,565
Yeah. He's my little
Yankee Doodle boy.

86
00:05:55,665 --> 00:05:58,501
Hey, get it!
Get it!

87
00:05:58,601 --> 00:06:00,102
Come on!

88
00:06:00,202 --> 00:06:01,966
Let's go!

89
00:06:30,569 --> 00:06:32,004
Did you like it?

90
00:06:32,104 --> 00:06:33,506
I don't know.

91
00:06:33,606 --> 00:06:35,007
I don't know.

92
00:06:35,107 --> 00:06:38,475
Hey, look how many
pushups I can do.

93
00:07:07,576 --> 00:07:09,344
Wow! Yeah!

94
00:07:09,444 --> 00:07:10,445
Yeah!

95
00:07:10,545 --> 00:07:12,878
Come on, Ronnie!

96
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:18,153
Go, Ronnie, Go!

97
00:07:18,254 --> 00:07:20,657
Go, Ronnie!
You can do it!

98
00:07:20,757 --> 00:07:21,917
Go!

99
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:30,534
Yes!

100
00:07:30,634 --> 00:07:34,271
Yes! That's my boy!

101
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:36,237
That's my boy!

102
00:07:41,613 --> 00:07:43,415
Yes!

103
00:07:43,515 --> 00:07:47,453
Ronnie, you made it!

104
00:07:47,553 --> 00:07:50,716
Yeah, all right!

105
00:07:50,823 --> 00:07:54,427
Tommy! Ronnie!
Come on!

106
00:07:54,527 --> 00:07:56,662
You're going to miss it!

107
00:07:56,762 --> 00:07:58,966
Michelle! Barbara!

108
00:07:59,066 --> 00:08:00,701
You've got to see this!

109
00:08:00,801 --> 00:08:03,403
Not as a call
to bear arms,

110
00:08:03,503 --> 00:08:04,905
though arms we need,

111
00:08:05,005 --> 00:08:07,641
but a call
to bear the burden

112
00:08:07,741 --> 00:08:09,643
of a long
twilight struggle,

113
00:08:09,743 --> 00:08:12,981
a struggle against
the common enemies of man...

114
00:08:13,081 --> 00:08:17,952
tyranny, poverty,
disease, and war itself.

115
00:08:18,052 --> 00:08:20,748
You'll get a licking
if you're late!

116
00:08:20,855 --> 00:08:23,484
In the long history
of the world,

117
00:08:23,592 --> 00:08:26,729
only a few generations
have been granted the role

118
00:08:26,829 --> 00:08:28,964
of defending freedom...

119
00:08:29,064 --> 00:08:30,432
Look, President Kennedy,
Daddy.

120
00:08:30,532 --> 00:08:31,433
That's right.

121
00:08:31,533 --> 00:08:32,935
He's so handsome.

122
00:08:33,035 --> 00:08:35,705
I do not shrink
from this responsibility,

123
00:08:35,805 --> 00:08:38,008
I welcome it.

124
00:08:38,108 --> 00:08:42,045
Let the word go forth
from this time and place

125
00:08:42,145 --> 00:08:44,547
that the torch
has been passed

126
00:08:44,647 --> 00:08:47,051
to a new generation
of Americans

127
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:50,287
born in this century.

128
00:08:50,387 --> 00:08:53,083
Let every nation know

129
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:56,751
that we shall
pay any price,

130
00:08:56,861 --> 00:08:59,164
bear any burden,

131
00:08:59,264 --> 00:09:03,902
support any friend,
oppose any foe

132
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:05,971
to assure the survival

133
00:09:06,071 --> 00:09:07,839
and the success
of liberty.

134
00:09:07,939 --> 00:09:10,877
I had a dream, Ronnie,
the other night,

135
00:09:10,977 --> 00:09:13,646
and you were speaking
to a large crowd

136
00:09:13,746 --> 00:09:15,381
just like him.

137
00:09:15,481 --> 00:09:16,849
Just like him.

138
00:09:16,949 --> 00:09:19,352
And you were saying
great things.

139
00:09:19,452 --> 00:09:21,321
And so,
my fellow Americans,

140
00:09:21,421 --> 00:09:25,084
ask not what your country
can do for you,

141
00:09:25,192 --> 00:09:28,929
ask what you can do
for your country.

142
00:09:29,029 --> 00:09:31,231
Right! Right up!

143
00:09:31,331 --> 00:09:33,323
Get out!
Got to get out!

144
00:09:33,434 --> 00:09:34,803
You got to get out!

145
00:09:34,903 --> 00:09:36,304
You got to get out!

146
00:09:36,404 --> 00:09:38,929
Hit that switch!
Hit the switch!

147
00:09:41,276 --> 00:09:42,677
All right,
hit the ropes!

148
00:09:42,777 --> 00:09:44,346
Go, go, go!

149
00:09:44,446 --> 00:09:45,981
Hand over hand over hand!

150
00:09:46,081 --> 00:09:47,950
Get those legs
off those ropes!

151
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:50,219
Come on, ladies,
let's come down!

152
00:09:50,319 --> 00:09:51,687
Let's come down!

153
00:09:51,787 --> 00:09:53,189
That rope is like life!

154
00:09:53,289 --> 00:09:55,791
You grab it
and hang onto it! Next!

155
00:09:55,891 --> 00:09:58,622
I want you to kill!

156
00:09:58,728 --> 00:09:59,820
You hear me?

157
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:00,831
Yes, sir!

158
00:10:00,931 --> 00:10:01,832
Kill!

159
00:10:01,932 --> 00:10:03,333
I want that
conference championship!

160
00:10:03,433 --> 00:10:05,335
Do you want that conference
championship?

161
00:10:05,435 --> 00:10:06,424
Yes, sir!

162
00:10:06,536 --> 00:10:07,905
Get up! Heads!

163
00:10:08,005 --> 00:10:10,341
Get them up!
Do you hear me?

164
00:10:10,441 --> 00:10:13,745
Get your heads up, ladies!
Get your heads up!

165
00:10:13,845 --> 00:10:16,280
I want that
conference championship!

166
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:19,317
If you want to win,
you got to suffer!

167
00:10:19,417 --> 00:10:21,320
You want to be the best?

168
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,722
You got to pay the price
for victory,

169
00:10:23,822 --> 00:10:25,758
and the price is sacrifice!

170
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:29,061
Susanne, no homework
at the table, please.

171
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:31,152
No, Tommy.
After supper.

172
00:10:31,264 --> 00:10:32,128
Dad?

173
00:10:32,232 --> 00:10:33,130
Yeah?

174
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:34,667
Can I come
with you?

175
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:36,636
There's the next
conference champion.

176
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:38,171
Sorry I'm late, Ma.

177
00:10:38,271 --> 00:10:39,639
There's rice
on the stove

178
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:41,174
and fruit
in the icebox.

179
00:10:41,274 --> 00:10:42,175
I can't.

180
00:10:42,275 --> 00:10:43,644
It's on your diet,
right?

181
00:10:43,744 --> 00:10:46,647
I got to drop 3 pounds
by Saturday.

182
00:10:46,747 --> 00:10:48,649
Your brother's
a hard worker, Tommy,

183
00:10:48,749 --> 00:10:51,252
'cause he wants
to be the best.

184
00:10:51,352 --> 00:10:54,088
Win or lose... in school,
in sports, in life...

185
00:10:54,188 --> 00:10:57,058
as long
as you do your best,

186
00:10:57,158 --> 00:10:59,161
that's what matters
to God.

187
00:10:59,261 --> 00:11:01,563
Win or lose,
we still love him.

188
00:11:01,663 --> 00:11:03,565
Can I go
to my room?

189
00:11:03,665 --> 00:11:04,597
Yeah, sure.

190
00:11:04,699 --> 00:11:06,569
Thank you, God,
for this food.

191
00:11:06,669 --> 00:11:11,007
In the name of the Father,
the Son, the Holy Ghost, amen.

192
00:11:11,107 --> 00:11:12,842
Daddy, Jimmy
took my doll!

193
00:11:12,942 --> 00:11:14,343
I'll get the doll.

194
00:11:14,443 --> 00:11:15,812
I hate his guts!

195
00:11:15,912 --> 00:11:17,313
Just go to bed.

196
00:11:17,413 --> 00:11:18,816
I didn't take anything!

197
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:20,317
Where's
your sister's doll?

198
00:11:20,417 --> 00:11:23,253
Jackie? Why
is Jackie not in bed?

199
00:11:23,353 --> 00:11:24,445
Ronnie.

200
00:11:26,723 --> 00:11:28,192
Where'd
you get this?

201
00:11:28,292 --> 00:11:30,728
Why are you
in my room?

202
00:11:30,828 --> 00:11:32,630
Don't change
the subject.

203
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:35,567
I don't allow Playboy magazine
in this house.

204
00:11:35,667 --> 00:11:36,601
Stevie gave it to me.

205
00:11:36,701 --> 00:11:38,601
You have filthy,
impure thoughts!

206
00:11:38,703 --> 00:11:40,170
God's going
to punish you.

207
00:11:40,271 --> 00:11:43,175
I haven't even looked
at it yet, all right?

208
00:11:43,275 --> 00:11:46,679
Go to confession. I want you
to tell Father McKenna.

209
00:11:46,779 --> 00:11:49,148
I don't want to see
this filthy magazine

210
00:11:49,248 --> 00:11:50,649
in my house again.

211
00:11:50,749 --> 00:11:52,218
Now, take this away!

212
00:11:52,318 --> 00:11:53,720
What's going on?

213
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:54,688
Nothing.

214
00:11:54,788 --> 00:11:56,189
What do you mean,
nothing?

215
00:11:56,289 --> 00:11:58,120
Nothing, Dad. O.K.?

216
00:12:08,903 --> 00:12:11,963
You're out of bounds, guys.
Back inside.

217
00:12:12,073 --> 00:12:15,133
Come on, Kovic, back inside.
Come on, Kovic.

218
00:12:16,377 --> 00:12:18,680
Go, Ronnie.

219
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,248
Kovic, back inside.
Come on, Kovic.

220
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,684
Back inside.
Let's go.

221
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:24,720
I want to see
some explosion!

222
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,221
Come on, Ronnie!

223
00:12:26,321 --> 00:12:27,956
No messing around!

224
00:12:28,056 --> 00:12:29,993
You're great, Ronnie!
You're great, Ronnie!

225
00:12:30,093 --> 00:12:31,461
Stay with him!

226
00:12:31,561 --> 00:12:33,463
Come on down!
All right!

227
00:12:33,563 --> 00:12:35,465
O.K. Get off
the mat.

228
00:12:35,565 --> 00:12:36,964
You're going
to get...

229
00:12:39,402 --> 00:12:41,839
Get him! Get him!
Get him! Get him!

230
00:12:41,939 --> 00:12:43,507
Reversal.
2 points!

231
00:12:43,607 --> 00:12:45,768
All right!

232
00:12:45,876 --> 00:12:47,639
Oh, yes, yes, yes,
yes, yes!

233
00:12:47,745 --> 00:12:49,178
Ohh, you!

234
00:12:56,654 --> 00:12:58,747
One, red!
You're both up.

235
00:13:00,892 --> 00:13:03,428
All right, fresh start.
Fresh start.

236
00:13:03,528 --> 00:13:06,399
Stand up.
Don't let him get you!

237
00:13:06,499 --> 00:13:07,900
Don't
let him get you!

238
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,902
Pull him out!
All right!

239
00:13:10,002 --> 00:13:11,370
Watch those legs.
Watch him!

240
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:14,173
Get him down!
Don't let him get the neck!

241
00:13:14,273 --> 00:13:15,842
No! No!

242
00:13:15,942 --> 00:13:17,477
No!

243
00:13:17,577 --> 00:13:19,704
You can beat him,
Ronnie!

244
00:13:20,847 --> 00:13:22,906
Come on! Come on!
Come on!

245
00:13:23,016 --> 00:13:24,415
Ronnie, Ronnie, Ronnie!

246
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:29,524
Bridge! Bridge!

247
00:13:29,624 --> 00:13:33,116
You can win!
Don't give up!

248
00:13:35,063 --> 00:13:36,792
Aah!

249
00:13:42,337 --> 00:13:45,204
Oh, no!

250
00:13:53,883 --> 00:13:55,441
O.K., son?

251
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:04,028
Oh, no.

252
00:14:04,128 --> 00:14:06,187
Come on, get up.

253
00:14:11,235 --> 00:14:13,037
Attention!

254
00:14:13,137 --> 00:14:15,073
Forward march!

255
00:14:15,173 --> 00:14:17,342
Left, left.

256
00:14:17,442 --> 00:14:19,034
Left, right, left.

257
00:14:24,416 --> 00:14:26,180
Seats!

258
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:32,617
Good morning.

259
00:14:32,725 --> 00:14:35,161
I am Gunnery
Sergeant Hayes.

260
00:14:35,261 --> 00:14:36,662
This is
Sergeant Bowers.

261
00:14:36,762 --> 00:14:40,597
United States Marine Recruiting Station,
Levittown, New York.

262
00:14:43,637 --> 00:14:45,172
We are here today

263
00:14:45,272 --> 00:14:48,342
at the request of your principal
Mr. Richards

264
00:14:48,442 --> 00:14:50,545
and other members
of the faculty

265
00:14:50,645 --> 00:14:54,582
to tell you a little bit
about the Marine Corps.

266
00:14:54,682 --> 00:14:56,384
First off,
young men,

267
00:14:56,484 --> 00:14:58,577
let's get
one thing straight.

268
00:15:00,088 --> 00:15:04,048
Not everybody becomes
United States Marines.

269
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,650
We want the best,

270
00:15:05,761 --> 00:15:08,164
and we'll accept nothing
but the best,

271
00:15:08,264 --> 00:15:10,199
because there
is nothing prouder,

272
00:15:10,299 --> 00:15:12,935
nothing finer, nothing
standing as straight

273
00:15:13,035 --> 00:15:15,972
as a United States Marine.

274
00:15:16,072 --> 00:15:18,108
Now, they've got the Army.

275
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,143
They got the Navy.

276
00:15:20,243 --> 00:15:22,879
They got
the Air Farce.

277
00:15:22,979 --> 00:15:25,416
And if you want
to join them,

278
00:15:25,516 --> 00:15:26,884
be my guest.

279
00:15:26,984 --> 00:15:29,520
But if you want
a challenge...

280
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:32,817
if you want to try
something difficult...

281
00:15:32,924 --> 00:15:35,860
if you want to try to
achieve the impossible...

282
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,831
you try 13 weeks of hell

283
00:15:38,931 --> 00:15:40,332
at Parris Island,
South Carolina,

284
00:15:40,432 --> 00:15:43,469
and you'll find out
if you got what it takes.

285
00:15:43,569 --> 00:15:46,872
You'll find out
if you really are a man,

286
00:15:46,972 --> 00:15:50,610
then the Marines may be
what you're looking for.

287
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:52,045
Tarawa...

288
00:15:52,145 --> 00:15:53,346
Iwo Jima...

289
00:15:53,446 --> 00:15:55,949
Belleau Wood...

290
00:15:56,049 --> 00:15:58,381
the Frozen
Chosan Reservoir.

291
00:16:00,154 --> 00:16:03,090
First to fight.
We have never lost a war.

292
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:06,455
We have always come when
our country's called us.

293
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,824
Now, Sergeant Bowers and I

294
00:16:08,929 --> 00:16:11,365
would like to open this up
to questions.

295
00:16:11,465 --> 00:16:14,836
So if any of you young men
do have questions,

296
00:16:14,936 --> 00:16:17,205
go ahead
and raise your hands.

297
00:16:17,305 --> 00:16:19,207
Come on, now.
Don't be afraid.

298
00:16:19,307 --> 00:16:21,710
Don't forget, a good
Marine's a thinking Marine.

299
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:23,145
Billy Vorsovich, sir.

300
00:16:23,245 --> 00:16:26,649
When would I get to wear
a uniform like you?

301
00:16:26,749 --> 00:16:29,519
You can be wearing this
in 13 weeks.

302
00:16:29,619 --> 00:16:31,053
Go! Go!

303
00:16:31,153 --> 00:16:32,822
Go, Massapequa!

304
00:16:32,922 --> 00:16:35,292
Go! Go! Go!

305
00:16:35,392 --> 00:16:37,189
- Yay!
- Yay!

306
00:16:40,964 --> 00:16:42,192
Hi, Donna.

307
00:16:44,735 --> 00:16:46,470
Go! Go!

308
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:48,139
Go, Massapequa!

309
00:16:48,239 --> 00:16:49,407
Go!

310
00:16:49,507 --> 00:16:51,376
My brother's at school
at Adelphi.

311
00:16:51,476 --> 00:16:55,469
He said there will be a war in...
what is it?

312
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:56,514
Vietnam.

313
00:16:56,614 --> 00:16:58,984
The Marines will be
the first in,

314
00:16:59,084 --> 00:17:01,052
and it won't
last long.

315
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:05,024
So if we don't sign up
soon, we'll miss it.

316
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:07,526
I've already decided.
I'm going in.

317
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:08,527
Really?

318
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:10,029
Just like that?

319
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:12,532
I'm not waiting.
I'm going in now.

320
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:13,533
You're crazy.

321
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:16,069
Our dads
got to go to WWII.

322
00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:19,039
This is our chance
to be part of history.

323
00:17:19,139 --> 00:17:20,840
Yeah, just like
our dads.

324
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,806
Think about
what you're doing.

325
00:17:24,211 --> 00:17:26,614
It could be dangerous
over there.

326
00:17:26,714 --> 00:17:28,716
You could
get yourself killed.

327
00:17:28,816 --> 00:17:31,910
Where are you going,
squirrel head? College?

328
00:17:32,019 --> 00:17:34,323
I want to do something
with my life.

329
00:17:34,423 --> 00:17:36,792
I can get a degree in
Business Administration.

330
00:17:36,892 --> 00:17:39,061
You don't need
to serve your country?

331
00:17:39,161 --> 00:17:41,997
Don't you care
about anybody but yourself?

332
00:17:42,097 --> 00:17:43,498
Better dead than red.

333
00:17:43,598 --> 00:17:46,002
They got missiles pointed
at us everywhere. ICBMs.

334
00:17:46,102 --> 00:17:47,904
Coming in
all around us.

335
00:17:48,004 --> 00:17:49,439
Cuba now.
90 miles away.

336
00:17:49,539 --> 00:17:50,907
They're taking over.

337
00:17:51,007 --> 00:17:52,308
When will we stop them?

338
00:17:52,408 --> 00:17:54,577
You can't stop them
by yourself.

339
00:17:54,677 --> 00:17:56,512
Communism is
moving in everywhere.

340
00:17:56,612 --> 00:17:58,949
Where, Ronnie?
I don't see them.

341
00:17:59,049 --> 00:18:00,417
They're not here
in Massapequa,

342
00:18:00,517 --> 00:18:02,917
so I'll just take care
of number one.

343
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:04,955
That's right.
Me... Stevie, number one.

344
00:18:05,055 --> 00:18:07,958
Someone's got to stay
with the women and children

345
00:18:08,058 --> 00:18:10,428
while the men
go do the fighting.

346
00:18:10,528 --> 00:18:13,019
All I'm saying is,
think about it.

347
00:18:13,131 --> 00:18:14,532
Think about it,
Ronnie.

348
00:18:14,632 --> 00:18:17,402
Stevie, who are you taking
to the prom?

349
00:18:17,502 --> 00:18:18,870
Wendy Daniels.

350
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:19,871
Wendy Daniels?

351
00:18:19,971 --> 00:18:20,839
Wendy Daniels?

352
00:18:20,939 --> 00:18:22,642
He got desperate.

353
00:18:22,742 --> 00:18:25,177
Well, who are you taking,
Joey, your mother?

354
00:18:25,277 --> 00:18:29,181
Ronnie, who are you going
to take to the prom?

355
00:18:29,281 --> 00:18:30,683
You don't know her.

356
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:32,719
She's a pretty girl
from Ronkonkoma.

357
00:18:32,819 --> 00:18:34,187
What's her name?

358
00:18:34,287 --> 00:18:35,455
You don't know her.

359
00:18:35,555 --> 00:18:37,455
What's her name,
Ronnie?

360
00:18:37,557 --> 00:18:38,925
Her name
is Lombardi.

361
00:18:39,025 --> 00:18:39,926
Lombardi?

362
00:18:40,026 --> 00:18:40,927
Yeah.

363
00:18:41,027 --> 00:18:42,619
Vince Lombardi?

364
00:18:42,729 --> 00:18:44,698
Rosanna Lombardi.

365
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,701
She's from
out of town, right?

366
00:18:46,801 --> 00:18:48,703
She going
to get a motel?

367
00:18:48,803 --> 00:18:51,397
'Cause I'd like
to get in on that.

368
00:18:57,312 --> 00:19:00,249
Ronnie, would you take this
to section three?

369
00:19:00,349 --> 00:19:02,751
Check the stock
for dog food.

370
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:03,752
Dog food.

371
00:19:03,852 --> 00:19:05,788
Then finish
stacking the potatoes.

372
00:19:05,888 --> 00:19:07,256
Come on. Let's go.

373
00:19:07,356 --> 00:19:10,292
Let's do some work
for a change.

374
00:19:10,393 --> 00:19:12,329
This goes
in section three?

375
00:19:12,429 --> 00:19:13,330
Section three.

376
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:14,624
O.K., Dad.

377
00:19:39,858 --> 00:19:41,593
Hey, Donna.

378
00:19:41,693 --> 00:19:42,761
Hi, Ronnie.

379
00:19:42,861 --> 00:19:43,658
Hi, Ronnie.

380
00:19:43,763 --> 00:19:44,388
Hi, Ronnie.

381
00:19:44,497 --> 00:19:46,556
How you doing?
How's...

382
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:47,967
Good.

383
00:19:48,067 --> 00:19:51,471
I heard that you were going
into the Marines.

384
00:19:51,571 --> 00:19:52,772
Yeah, yeah.

385
00:19:52,872 --> 00:19:55,275
It's better than
working at A&P.

386
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:56,777
That's great,
Ronnie.

387
00:19:56,877 --> 00:19:57,945
That's wonderful.

388
00:19:58,045 --> 00:19:59,947
I'm going
to boot camp soon.

389
00:20:00,047 --> 00:20:01,949
I joined
for four years,

390
00:20:02,049 --> 00:20:03,450
so I go to Vietnam,

391
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:05,452
probably on
the front line.

392
00:20:05,552 --> 00:20:06,654
Really?

393
00:20:06,754 --> 00:20:08,656
I'll see
a lot of action.

394
00:20:08,756 --> 00:20:09,657
Wow.

395
00:20:09,757 --> 00:20:11,459
That's neat.

396
00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:13,962
Heard you got
into that school.

397
00:20:14,062 --> 00:20:15,130
The letter?

398
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:16,297
Yeah.

399
00:20:16,397 --> 00:20:17,866
Yeah, Syracuse.

400
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:19,958
It's going to be
really hard.

401
00:20:20,069 --> 00:20:23,472
Could I... Could I talk
to you in private?

402
00:20:23,572 --> 00:20:25,472
Oh, yeah. Sure.

403
00:20:29,245 --> 00:20:31,681
I've been meaning
to call you.

404
00:20:31,781 --> 00:20:33,183
I was wondering,

405
00:20:33,283 --> 00:20:36,787
are you going with
someone to the prom?

406
00:20:36,887 --> 00:20:38,655
Yeah. I'm going
with Jed.

407
00:20:38,755 --> 00:20:40,190
Oh, yeah?
That's great.

408
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:43,194
I mean, he's
a nice guy... Jed.

409
00:20:43,294 --> 00:20:44,695
Stevie Boyer told me

410
00:20:44,795 --> 00:20:48,132
that you were taking some girl
from Lake Ronkonkoma.

411
00:20:48,232 --> 00:20:49,634
Yeah. No, no.

412
00:20:49,734 --> 00:20:50,758
No?

413
00:20:50,868 --> 00:20:53,598
No. I don't have time
for that stuff.

414
00:20:53,705 --> 00:20:56,608
There's a lot of things
to take care of

415
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:58,944
before you go
in the Marines.

416
00:20:59,044 --> 00:21:01,647
I didn't even know
how much stuff.

417
00:21:01,747 --> 00:21:04,416
Maybe I'll see you
before I leave, O.K.?

418
00:21:04,516 --> 00:21:08,121
# Soldier boy #

419
00:21:08,221 --> 00:21:12,658
# Oh, my little
soldier boy #

420
00:21:14,527 --> 00:21:22,670
# I'll be true to you #

421
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:27,935
# You were
my first love #

422
00:21:28,042 --> 00:21:32,814
# And you'll be
my last love #

423
00:21:32,914 --> 00:21:37,752
# I will never
make you blue #

424
00:21:37,852 --> 00:21:42,658
# I'll be true to you #

425
00:21:42,758 --> 00:21:47,597
# In this whole world #

426
00:21:47,697 --> 00:21:49,198
# You can love
but one girl #

427
00:21:49,298 --> 00:21:51,200
I told you
I love you.

428
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,569
You promised.

429
00:21:52,669 --> 00:21:56,901
# Let me be
that one girl #

430
00:21:57,007 --> 00:22:01,671
# For I'll be
true to you ##

431
00:22:06,384 --> 00:22:08,820
The batter is
Mickey Mantle.

432
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,321
Mickey has two strikes

433
00:22:10,421 --> 00:22:12,790
and the chance
to put the Yankees

434
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:14,292
ahead in this game.

435
00:22:14,392 --> 00:22:16,295
The pitcher
gets his sign,

436
00:22:16,395 --> 00:22:18,797
takes his stretch,
checks the runners.

437
00:22:18,897 --> 00:22:20,332
Here's the pitch.

438
00:22:20,432 --> 00:22:22,234
Mickey swings,
and he connects!

439
00:22:22,334 --> 00:22:25,237
There's a long drive
deep to center field!

440
00:22:25,337 --> 00:22:26,739
It is going, going!

441
00:22:26,839 --> 00:22:29,242
It is gone
into the bleachers,

442
00:22:29,342 --> 00:22:31,606
455 feet away

443
00:22:31,711 --> 00:22:35,272
for Mickey's
491st home run!

444
00:22:35,382 --> 00:22:36,816
How about that?

445
00:22:36,916 --> 00:22:39,353
The crowd is
on its feet,

446
00:22:39,453 --> 00:22:41,355
giving Mickey
a standing ovation.

447
00:22:41,455 --> 00:22:43,157
# And rattle
your walls #

448
00:22:43,257 --> 00:22:48,296
# For the times,
they are a-changin' #

449
00:22:48,396 --> 00:22:50,932
# Come, senators
and congressmen #

450
00:22:51,032 --> 00:22:52,668
# Please
heed the call #

451
00:22:52,768 --> 00:22:54,803
# Don't stand
in the doorway #

452
00:22:54,903 --> 00:22:56,972
# Don't lock up
the hall #

453
00:22:57,072 --> 00:22:59,341
# For the times,
they are a-changin' ##

454
00:22:59,441 --> 00:23:00,842
There's absolutely
no question.

455
00:23:00,942 --> 00:23:02,311
The First Cavalry Division

456
00:23:02,411 --> 00:23:05,315
is the latest concept
in mobile warfare.

457
00:23:05,415 --> 00:23:06,816
One division is worth

458
00:23:06,916 --> 00:23:09,552
21/2 Russian
and 6 Chinese divisions.

459
00:23:09,652 --> 00:23:12,055
How well will
the individual soldier

460
00:23:12,155 --> 00:23:14,090
stand up here
in Vietnam?

461
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:17,922
What do you think,
Dad, about that?

462
00:23:18,028 --> 00:23:19,330
I don't know.

463
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:20,897
13,000 miles...

464
00:23:20,998 --> 00:23:24,234
that's a long way to go
to fight a war.

465
00:23:24,334 --> 00:23:26,738
They fought the French
and the Japanese

466
00:23:26,838 --> 00:23:28,073
for 30 years.

467
00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:30,075
Can they
be weeded out?

468
00:23:30,175 --> 00:23:32,110
Anything
that lives in a cave

469
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:33,578
can be weeded out.

470
00:23:33,678 --> 00:23:38,217
I just hope they send you
to Europe or Korea or...

471
00:23:38,317 --> 00:23:39,385
They can't.

472
00:23:39,485 --> 00:23:40,653
Someplace safe.

473
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:43,656
Every Marine has
a tour of duty there.

474
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:45,691
It's not like the Army.

475
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:47,159
What's wrong with you?

476
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:49,227
You served.
Uncle Bob served.

477
00:23:49,328 --> 00:23:51,024
I know, Ronnie.
I know.

478
00:23:51,131 --> 00:23:53,099
Remember what
President Kennedy said?

479
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,035
There won't be
an America anymore

480
00:23:55,135 --> 00:23:57,504
unless people are willing
to sacrifice.

481
00:23:57,604 --> 00:23:58,972
I love my country.

482
00:23:59,072 --> 00:23:59,973
I know.

483
00:24:00,073 --> 00:24:01,509
And you're right,
Ronnie.

484
00:24:01,609 --> 00:24:03,378
You're doing
the right thing.

485
00:24:03,478 --> 00:24:05,246
Communism has
to be stopped.

486
00:24:05,346 --> 00:24:07,615
It's God's will
you go.

487
00:24:07,715 --> 00:24:09,250
We're proud of you.

488
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:10,885
Be careful,
that's all.

489
00:24:10,985 --> 00:24:12,720
Up there in Hanoi,

490
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:15,724
they don't allow magazines,
newspapers, and televisions

491
00:24:15,824 --> 00:24:18,360
to cast doubts
on the military system.

492
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:22,362
Don't you know what being a Marine
means to me, Dad?

493
00:24:22,464 --> 00:24:24,333
Ever since
I was a kid,

494
00:24:24,433 --> 00:24:26,836
I've wanted
to serve my country,

495
00:24:26,936 --> 00:24:28,338
And I want to go.

496
00:24:28,438 --> 00:24:30,340
I want to go
to Vietnam,

497
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:33,534
and I'll die there
if I have to.

498
00:24:34,611 --> 00:24:37,548
The attitude of people
on the home front

499
00:24:37,648 --> 00:24:40,184
is very important
in this war.

500
00:24:40,284 --> 00:24:43,187
Not a nice night
for the prom.

501
00:24:43,287 --> 00:24:45,189
Can the South Vietnamese
government

502
00:24:45,289 --> 00:24:47,191
stand up
to the North?

503
00:24:47,291 --> 00:24:48,694
We wouldn't
be here

504
00:24:48,794 --> 00:24:50,352
if we didn't
think so.

505
00:24:59,437 --> 00:25:01,804
Sometimes, God,
I'm so confused.

506
00:25:04,777 --> 00:25:07,041
Sometimes
I think I'd just...

507
00:25:08,114 --> 00:25:11,050
like to stay here
in Massapequa

508
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:12,880
and never leave...

509
00:25:15,322 --> 00:25:17,051
but I got to go.

510
00:25:21,929 --> 00:25:23,297
Just help me, Jesus.

511
00:25:23,397 --> 00:25:26,060
Help me to make
the right decision.

512
00:25:28,002 --> 00:25:29,765
Please, dear God.

513
00:25:56,666 --> 00:25:58,068
Ron.

514
00:25:58,168 --> 00:26:00,037
Ronnie, what
happened to you?

515
00:26:00,137 --> 00:26:01,229
Ronnie.

516
00:26:16,555 --> 00:26:18,090
What...

517
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:19,714
Oh, Jeez.

518
00:26:20,893 --> 00:26:22,094
Donna.

519
00:26:22,194 --> 00:26:23,129
Ronnie.

520
00:26:23,229 --> 00:26:25,322
Will you
dance with me?

521
00:26:26,499 --> 00:26:28,434
Oh, yes.

522
00:26:28,534 --> 00:26:30,126
Yeah, sure.

523
00:26:46,888 --> 00:26:50,559
# Moon River #

524
00:26:50,659 --> 00:26:53,995
# Wider than a mile #

525
00:26:54,095 --> 00:26:57,934
# I'm crossing you
in style #

526
00:26:58,034 --> 00:27:01,904
# Someday #

527
00:27:02,004 --> 00:27:06,242
# Oh, dreammaker #

528
00:27:06,342 --> 00:27:10,006
# You heartbreaker #

529
00:27:10,113 --> 00:27:13,517
# Wherever you're goin' #

530
00:27:13,617 --> 00:27:17,988
# I'm goin' your way #

531
00:27:18,088 --> 00:27:22,160
# Two drifters #

532
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:25,096
# Off to see the world #

533
00:27:25,196 --> 00:27:29,200
# There's such
a lot of world #

534
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:33,105
# To see #

535
00:27:33,205 --> 00:27:37,576
# We're after
the same... ##

536
00:27:37,676 --> 00:27:42,010
# We're after
the same... ##

537
00:27:56,731 --> 00:27:59,400
2-Alpha, 2-Alpha,
this is 6, over.

538
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,068
6, 6,
2-Actual, over.

539
00:28:01,168 --> 00:28:03,404
2-Actual, this is 6.
That's a roger.

540
00:28:03,504 --> 00:28:05,273
You have beaucoup gooks.

541
00:28:05,373 --> 00:28:06,741
They're coming at you.

542
00:28:06,841 --> 00:28:08,610
Echo-1's
pushing them. Over.

543
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:10,012
6, 6, 2-Actual.

544
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:11,413
Sit Rep
as follows...

545
00:28:11,513 --> 00:28:13,448
two set in
on the beach.

546
00:28:13,548 --> 00:28:15,384
The tracks are
moving this way.

547
00:28:15,484 --> 00:28:17,953
Sounds like
beaucoup gooks in there.

548
00:28:18,053 --> 00:28:20,490
I'm finally
going to see one.

549
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:22,425
Relax, you'll be
all right.

550
00:28:22,525 --> 00:28:24,083
Where you from, Wilson?

551
00:28:24,193 --> 00:28:26,062
First Battalion,
Ninth Motor "T."

552
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:29,065
The Sergeant Major said the grunts
needed replacements,

553
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:32,369
so they took me out
of battalion supply.

554
00:28:32,469 --> 00:28:34,838
Where are you from
in the world?

555
00:28:34,938 --> 00:28:36,340
Oh, Venus, Georgia.

556
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,075
This is my second tour.

557
00:28:38,175 --> 00:28:41,111
I haven't seen a Georgia boy
get hurt yet.

558
00:28:41,211 --> 00:28:42,579
You'll be all right.

559
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:45,410
Echo-6, Echo-6,
Snake 1-9er...

560
00:28:47,052 --> 00:28:48,253
All right.

561
00:28:48,353 --> 00:28:51,447
Echo-1's taking incoming
northwest edge of the ville.

562
00:28:52,424 --> 00:28:54,949
We got gooks
moving this way.

563
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:56,462
Look out there,
Sergeant.

564
00:28:56,562 --> 00:28:57,964
Can you see them?

565
00:28:58,064 --> 00:28:59,799
Right there.
You see them?

566
00:28:59,899 --> 00:29:01,634
They got rifles.

567
00:29:01,734 --> 00:29:03,636
Can you see
the rifles?

568
00:29:03,736 --> 00:29:05,471
Right there.
You see them?

569
00:29:05,571 --> 00:29:06,974
You see them?

570
00:29:07,074 --> 00:29:08,709
Can you see
the rifles?

571
00:29:08,809 --> 00:29:11,678
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

572
00:29:11,778 --> 00:29:13,146
Pass the word.

573
00:29:13,246 --> 00:29:14,848
When I give
the order,

574
00:29:14,948 --> 00:29:16,650
I want to light up
this ville

575
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:18,151
like a motherfucking
Christmas tree.

576
00:29:18,251 --> 00:29:20,922
This time I think we got them!
Move out.

577
00:29:21,022 --> 00:29:23,422
Pass the word!
Fire on command!

578
00:29:23,524 --> 00:29:24,582
Wilson, come with me.

579
00:29:24,692 --> 00:29:25,920
Cover that big hooch!

580
00:29:26,027 --> 00:29:28,429
Fire on my command!
Pass the word!

581
00:29:28,529 --> 00:29:30,933
Corporal, start ranking.
Fire on my command!

582
00:29:31,033 --> 00:29:32,466
Fire on my command!

583
00:29:33,936 --> 00:29:34,870
Cease-fire!

584
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:36,138
What happened?

585
00:29:36,238 --> 00:29:39,207
What the fuck are you doing?

586
00:29:42,278 --> 00:29:43,980
Cease-fire!

587
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,479
What happened?

588
00:29:46,516 --> 00:29:47,450
Cease-fire!

589
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:49,986
I want to know
what happened!

590
00:29:50,086 --> 00:29:51,287
I don't know, sir.

591
00:29:51,387 --> 00:29:52,622
Possible accidental
discharge, sir.

592
00:29:52,722 --> 00:29:54,992
We better get
a sweep team in there.

593
00:29:55,092 --> 00:29:57,995
Take five men.
Tell me how many we got.

594
00:29:58,095 --> 00:29:58,996
Yes, sir.

595
00:29:59,096 --> 00:30:00,431
Motherfucker!

596
00:30:00,531 --> 00:30:02,400
Baldy on me!

597
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,835
Brooks!
Martinez! On me!

598
00:30:04,935 --> 00:30:06,338
Wilson!
Wilson, on me!

599
00:30:06,438 --> 00:30:09,341
2-alpha, moving on the ville
at this time. Over.

600
00:30:09,441 --> 00:30:11,033
Line! Line! Line!

601
00:30:13,445 --> 00:30:15,313
Ironhand for fire mission.

602
00:30:15,413 --> 00:30:16,848
Stand by.

603
00:30:16,948 --> 00:30:21,754
Grid... 1-5-6-3-7-9er.

604
00:30:21,854 --> 00:30:23,256
Direction... 5-800.

605
00:30:23,356 --> 00:30:25,792
Gooks in the ville,
Battery 6.

606
00:30:25,892 --> 00:30:27,291
Victor, Tango in effect.

607
00:30:27,393 --> 00:30:28,795
How copy? Over.

608
00:30:28,895 --> 00:30:29,797
Baldy! Baldy!

609
00:30:29,897 --> 00:30:31,832
Lai dai! Lai dai!

610
00:30:31,932 --> 00:30:34,301
Get him out!
Get him out!

611
00:30:34,401 --> 00:30:36,303
Come on,
Baldy, come on.

612
00:30:36,403 --> 00:30:38,806
Check it out over there!
Everything out!

613
00:30:38,906 --> 00:30:40,307
Baldy, get
everything out!

614
00:30:40,407 --> 00:30:42,343
Baldy! There!
Check it out!

615
00:30:42,443 --> 00:30:43,645
Echo-2, Alpha.

616
00:30:43,745 --> 00:30:46,147
Echo-2,
send your Sit Rep. Over.

617
00:30:46,247 --> 00:30:47,949
Lai dai! Lai dai!

618
00:30:48,049 --> 00:30:49,350
Lai dai! Lai dai!

619
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:50,652
Get him out!

620
00:30:50,752 --> 00:30:51,986
Get him out!

621
00:30:52,086 --> 00:30:54,356
Check those hooches
and clear ASAP.

622
00:30:54,456 --> 00:30:57,186
We've got a fire mission
inbound. Over.

623
00:30:58,093 --> 00:31:00,357
Oh, my God.

624
00:31:00,462 --> 00:31:03,866
We didn't
do this, did we?

625
00:31:03,966 --> 00:31:05,368
Oh, my God.

626
00:31:05,468 --> 00:31:06,870
Jesus Christ.

627
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:08,164
Oh, my God.

628
00:31:11,041 --> 00:31:14,211
2-Actual-2, better get down
here quick,

629
00:31:14,311 --> 00:31:16,047
and bring
the corpsmen.

630
00:31:16,147 --> 00:31:19,417
We got beaucoup wounded.
Civilians.

631
00:31:19,517 --> 00:31:21,849
Martinez, help me!

632
00:31:24,922 --> 00:31:26,724
We wasted them.

633
00:31:26,824 --> 00:31:30,454
Motherfucker!
We wasted them!

634
00:31:31,797 --> 00:31:33,287
Oh!

635
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:45,145
Det roy.

636
00:31:45,245 --> 00:31:46,803
Where are the rifles?

637
00:31:47,914 --> 00:31:49,282
Where are the rifles?

638
00:31:49,382 --> 00:31:51,252
There ain't no
fucking rifles.

639
00:31:51,352 --> 00:31:52,653
Damn it.

640
00:31:52,753 --> 00:31:54,188
Jesus fucking Christ!

641
00:31:54,288 --> 00:31:55,656
Well, help him then!

642
00:31:55,756 --> 00:31:58,192
Help him!
Help him! Help him!

643
00:31:58,292 --> 00:32:00,351
Oh, motherfuck...

644
00:32:01,295 --> 00:32:03,665
I want you
to help him.

645
00:32:03,765 --> 00:32:04,666
Forgive us.

646
00:32:04,766 --> 00:32:07,098
Help me!
Somebody help me!

647
00:32:10,171 --> 00:32:11,573
6, 6, 2-Actual.

648
00:32:11,673 --> 00:32:13,197
Request
emergency medevac.

649
00:32:13,308 --> 00:32:16,045
We got a lot
of friendly wounded. Over.

650
00:32:16,145 --> 00:32:17,380
Get out of there!

651
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,882
Leave those wounded!
You got Arty inbound!

652
00:32:19,982 --> 00:32:21,150
Get out! Get out!

653
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:23,386
Get back
to the dunes!

654
00:32:23,486 --> 00:32:26,255
We got gooks
in the ville! Move out!

655
00:32:26,355 --> 00:32:28,058
Get out! Move out!

656
00:32:28,158 --> 00:32:29,393
That's a direct order!

657
00:32:29,493 --> 00:32:31,461
I want you
out that door!

658
00:32:31,561 --> 00:32:33,697
It wasn't your fault,
goddamn it!

659
00:32:33,797 --> 00:32:36,667
They got
in the goddamned way!

660
00:32:36,767 --> 00:32:38,168
Get off the deck!

661
00:32:38,268 --> 00:32:40,794
We got gooks
in the ville!

662
00:32:40,905 --> 00:32:42,497
The baby!

663
00:32:42,607 --> 00:32:44,199
Get back to the dune!

664
00:32:44,309 --> 00:32:45,210
The baby!

665
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:46,711
No! Move out!
Let's move!

666
00:32:46,811 --> 00:32:48,779
Kovic, move!

667
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,149
Move out!

668
00:32:50,249 --> 00:32:51,684
Move out!
Move! Move!

669
00:32:51,784 --> 00:32:55,845
The ville is
going to blow!

670
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:11,898
Aah!

671
00:33:18,379 --> 00:33:21,712
Red! Abbot!

672
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:41,661
Aah!

673
00:33:49,546 --> 00:33:51,207
Wilson!

674
00:33:51,315 --> 00:33:52,646
Wilson's hit!

675
00:34:34,761 --> 00:34:36,898
What happened?

676
00:34:36,998 --> 00:34:38,399
Where's
First Platoon?

677
00:34:38,499 --> 00:34:40,364
For God's sake,
Corpsman!

678
00:34:43,571 --> 00:34:45,436
Where's my "A" gunner?

679
00:35:15,306 --> 00:35:17,842
Sergeant Kovic
here to see you, sir.

680
00:35:17,942 --> 00:35:19,534
Stand easy, sergeant.

681
00:35:21,245 --> 00:35:23,315
Yeah, Kovic,
the lieutenant told me

682
00:35:23,415 --> 00:35:25,584
that was
a pretty rough time.

683
00:35:25,684 --> 00:35:27,948
Yes, sir.
It was pretty bad.

684
00:35:28,053 --> 00:35:30,078
Ran into a few
of them?

685
00:35:30,188 --> 00:35:31,348
Yes, sir.

686
00:35:32,491 --> 00:35:35,461
You want to see me
about something, Sergeant?

687
00:35:35,561 --> 00:35:36,662
Yes, sir.

688
00:35:36,762 --> 00:35:39,665
Like I said to the captain,
uh, sir...

689
00:35:39,765 --> 00:35:42,668
it was a very
confusing day.

690
00:35:42,768 --> 00:35:43,870
The villagers...

691
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:46,840
Yeah. I know about
the villagers, Sergeant.

692
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:48,342
They...
the villagers...

693
00:35:48,442 --> 00:35:50,344
It was very,
very unfortunate.

694
00:35:50,444 --> 00:35:52,746
The enemy used
the villagers as cover.

695
00:35:52,846 --> 00:35:53,938
Yes, sir.

696
00:35:55,048 --> 00:35:57,284
They popped up,
started firing.

697
00:35:57,384 --> 00:35:59,154
We were
running back, sir.

698
00:35:59,254 --> 00:36:00,721
It was real glary.

699
00:36:00,822 --> 00:36:02,221
Very confusing,

700
00:36:02,323 --> 00:36:04,917
and that's when
it happened, sir.

701
00:36:05,026 --> 00:36:06,254
What happened?

702
00:36:06,361 --> 00:36:09,230
Sir, that was when
Wilson was killed, sir.

703
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:11,567
Yeah, I know
about Wilson.

704
00:36:11,667 --> 00:36:13,235
Sir, see...

705
00:36:13,335 --> 00:36:15,738
he was
the last one out,

706
00:36:15,838 --> 00:36:18,240
and that's when
it happened, sir.

707
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:20,276
Sir, I think
I might...

708
00:36:20,376 --> 00:36:22,746
I might have
killed him, sir.

709
00:36:22,846 --> 00:36:24,214
I don't think so.

710
00:36:24,314 --> 00:36:26,683
He was coming up
over the dune.

711
00:36:26,783 --> 00:36:29,386
I think I might
have killed him.

712
00:36:29,486 --> 00:36:30,554
It's hard.

713
00:36:30,654 --> 00:36:33,291
I was out a couple
of weeks ago.

714
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:36,519
Sometimes it's... very hard
to tell what's happening.

715
00:36:38,462 --> 00:36:39,690
Yes, sir.

716
00:36:40,965 --> 00:36:44,059
But, sir, I think
I killed Wilson.

717
00:36:50,342 --> 00:36:52,177
I don't think so, Kovic.

718
00:36:52,277 --> 00:36:55,514
But, sir, I want you
to know that...

719
00:36:55,614 --> 00:36:56,515
Don't talk like that!

720
00:36:56,615 --> 00:36:58,051
Don't tell me this shit.

721
00:36:58,151 --> 00:37:00,420
I'll take your head off.
Is that clear?

722
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,421
Yes, sir.

723
00:37:01,521 --> 00:37:02,422
That clear?

724
00:37:02,522 --> 00:37:03,590
Yes, sir!

725
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:04,748
All right.

726
00:37:06,292 --> 00:37:08,021
Carry on.

727
00:37:11,398 --> 00:37:14,663
X.O. Ought to
court-martial his ass.

728
00:37:18,238 --> 00:37:19,671
Sergeant K.

729
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:06,724
Get some sugar
in the blood.

730
00:38:06,824 --> 00:38:09,028
Ain't no thing, dog.

731
00:38:09,128 --> 00:38:11,630
Ain't nothing
but a thing, baby.

732
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:16,502
It's so hot out here, I want
to kill some motherfucking gooks.

733
00:38:16,602 --> 00:38:18,037
Dog, you're sounding
like a bitch, man.

734
00:38:18,137 --> 00:38:20,574
Ain't nothing
but a thing.

735
00:38:20,674 --> 00:38:22,175
Nothing but a thing.

736
00:38:22,275 --> 00:38:25,145
It's so hot out
in this motherfucker,

737
00:38:25,245 --> 00:38:27,304
this must be hell!

738
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:31,809
Or purgatory.

739
00:38:33,521 --> 00:38:36,547
Where's the motherfucking devil at?

740
00:38:51,306 --> 00:38:52,874
Take cover!

741
00:38:52,974 --> 00:38:55,102
Take cover!

742
00:39:01,317 --> 00:39:03,376
Take cover!

743
00:39:10,427 --> 00:39:11,895
Snake 1-9er airborne,

744
00:39:11,995 --> 00:39:13,397
Be advised machine guns

745
00:39:13,497 --> 00:39:15,733
now approaching
at your 12. Over.

746
00:39:15,833 --> 00:39:17,401
No. No, people!

747
00:39:17,501 --> 00:39:19,638
Move forward!
Move forward!

748
00:39:19,738 --> 00:39:21,906
Gun up! Gun up!

749
00:39:22,006 --> 00:39:24,876
2! 2! 2-Alpha!
Contact! Contact!

750
00:39:24,976 --> 00:39:27,968
Heavy incoming
from both treelines. Over.

751
00:39:28,913 --> 00:39:30,549
Uhh!

752
00:39:30,649 --> 00:39:31,946
Uhh!

753
00:39:33,953 --> 00:39:36,217
Son of a bitch!

754
00:39:37,857 --> 00:39:39,415
Aah!

755
00:39:39,525 --> 00:39:40,826
Aah!

756
00:39:40,926 --> 00:39:43,088
Fuck, man!

757
00:39:44,498 --> 00:39:45,760
Uhh.

758
00:39:54,041 --> 00:39:55,406
Aah!

759
00:40:14,363 --> 00:40:17,333
Aah!

760
00:40:21,404 --> 00:40:23,406
Fuck!

761
00:40:23,506 --> 00:40:24,908
Son of a bitch!

762
00:40:25,008 --> 00:40:25,909
2-Actual!

763
00:40:26,009 --> 00:40:27,744
Heavy incoming
from the ville!

764
00:40:27,844 --> 00:40:29,213
I'm in trouble!

765
00:40:29,313 --> 00:40:30,681
2, 2, Charlie,

766
00:40:30,781 --> 00:40:32,917
be advised
there's more of them.

767
00:40:33,017 --> 00:40:34,952
We see two squads
moving in

768
00:40:35,052 --> 00:40:36,487
from the left
treeline.

769
00:40:36,587 --> 00:40:40,525
Aah!

770
00:40:40,625 --> 00:40:42,561
I'm in trouble
out here!

771
00:40:42,661 --> 00:40:44,596
I'm in trouble out here!

772
00:40:44,696 --> 00:40:47,599
2, Echo-6!
Get out of that ville!

773
00:40:47,699 --> 00:40:49,801
Get out of that ville!

774
00:40:49,901 --> 00:40:52,605
They're going to
cut you off! Get out!

775
00:40:52,705 --> 00:40:54,935
I need everything
you got!

776
00:40:59,145 --> 00:41:01,581
We're going down!
We're going down!

777
00:41:01,681 --> 00:41:03,550
I can't hold this bitch!

778
00:41:03,650 --> 00:41:06,778
Hold it, goddamn it!
Pull up! Pull up!

779
00:41:08,722 --> 00:41:10,212
Aah!

780
00:41:13,227 --> 00:41:14,717
Goddamn it!

781
00:41:17,465 --> 00:41:19,763
God damn it!

782
00:41:33,983 --> 00:41:35,507
Corpsmen...

783
00:41:37,253 --> 00:41:38,687
Corpsmen...

784
00:41:43,793 --> 00:41:45,590
Corpsmen... Corpsmen.

785
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,769
Goddamn!
Motherfuckers!

786
00:42:02,814 --> 00:42:05,146
Goddamn motherfuckers!

787
00:42:06,251 --> 00:42:08,811
Motherfucker!
Goddamn!

788
00:42:13,759 --> 00:42:14,761
Motherfuckers!

789
00:42:14,861 --> 00:42:16,920
Fuckers!

790
00:42:58,274 --> 00:43:00,476
We got six
sucking chest wounds

791
00:43:00,576 --> 00:43:02,746
and 12 crispy critters
coming in!

792
00:43:02,846 --> 00:43:05,515
Zap him with 250 mils
of happy juice

793
00:43:05,615 --> 00:43:06,884
until he crashes out.

794
00:43:06,984 --> 00:43:08,619
Just get him to sleep.

795
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:09,653
Open table!

796
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:10,754
Who's got a hot one?

797
00:43:10,854 --> 00:43:12,222
What do we have?

798
00:43:12,322 --> 00:43:14,225
His kidney
and liver are gone.

799
00:43:14,325 --> 00:43:16,761
We better just kiss
this one goodbye.

800
00:43:16,861 --> 00:43:18,229
All right, take off.

801
00:43:18,329 --> 00:43:20,231
There's something
wrong with me.

802
00:43:20,331 --> 00:43:22,233
Code blue! Code blue!

803
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:24,169
Let's go!
He's code blue!

804
00:43:24,269 --> 00:43:25,704
Code blue! Code blue!

805
00:43:25,804 --> 00:43:28,364
Get the machine!
Get the machine!

806
00:43:32,344 --> 00:43:34,713
Let me in.
Let me in.

807
00:43:34,813 --> 00:43:37,717
Stay with me, Marine.
Stay with me!

808
00:43:37,817 --> 00:43:39,719
Give me
the shock defibs!

809
00:43:39,819 --> 00:43:41,254
Stay with me now.

810
00:43:41,354 --> 00:43:43,914
We're going to
jump-start you. Clear!

811
00:43:45,091 --> 00:43:48,062
Where's the priest?
Get me a priest.

812
00:43:48,162 --> 00:43:50,494
Breathe! Breathe!
Breathe!

813
00:43:51,432 --> 00:43:52,922
Breathe!

814
00:43:56,337 --> 00:43:59,073
I took the Packers
at minus 7.

815
00:43:59,173 --> 00:44:01,438
Shit. They ain't
got a chance.

816
00:44:03,845 --> 00:44:06,040
How are you?

817
00:44:07,082 --> 00:44:09,985
You tell them
they've got to operate.

818
00:44:10,085 --> 00:44:12,021
There's something
wrong with me.

819
00:44:12,121 --> 00:44:13,723
The doctors
are real busy.

820
00:44:13,823 --> 00:44:15,725
There's a lot
of wounded here.

821
00:44:15,825 --> 00:44:17,393
There's no time
for anything

822
00:44:17,493 --> 00:44:19,262
except trying
to stay alive.

823
00:44:19,362 --> 00:44:21,898
You got to try
and stay alive. O. K?

824
00:44:21,998 --> 00:44:23,500
Try and stay alive.

825
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:27,671
I've come to give you
your last rites.

826
00:44:27,771 --> 00:44:29,966
Are you ready?

827
00:44:31,075 --> 00:44:32,975
I'm ready, Father.

828
00:44:36,915 --> 00:44:39,351
I am the resurrection
and the life.

829
00:44:39,451 --> 00:44:41,009
He that believeth in me,

830
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:43,388
though he were dead,
yet shall he live.

831
00:44:43,488 --> 00:44:45,357
We brought nothing
into this world,

832
00:44:45,457 --> 00:44:47,927
and it's certain
we can take nothing out.

833
00:44:48,027 --> 00:44:50,963
The Lord giveth, and
the Lord taketh away.

834
00:44:51,063 --> 00:45:09,816
Blessed be the name
of the Lord.

835
00:45:09,916 --> 00:45:12,620
# I got sunshine #

836
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:15,655
# On a cloudy day #

837
00:45:17,558 --> 00:45:20,628
# And when it's
cold outside #

838
00:45:20,728 --> 00:45:23,596
# I got
the month of May ##

839
00:45:23,699 --> 00:45:26,602
Eddie, I need
some help in room 13.

840
00:45:26,702 --> 00:45:28,637
Give me
a second, man.

841
00:45:28,737 --> 00:45:29,931
His catheter's
plugging up.

842
00:45:30,038 --> 00:45:32,474
It's backing up
into his kidney.

843
00:45:32,574 --> 00:45:34,477
I said I'd be there.

844
00:45:34,577 --> 00:45:36,613
Give me a break.

845
00:45:36,713 --> 00:45:37,947
Man, what's going up?

846
00:45:38,047 --> 00:45:38,982
Nothing, man.

847
00:45:39,082 --> 00:45:41,451
You ain't supposed
to be having this.

848
00:45:41,551 --> 00:45:42,619
Oh!

849
00:45:42,719 --> 00:45:46,157
Didn't I tell you not
to do that to him

850
00:45:46,257 --> 00:45:47,725
in the A.M.?

851
00:45:47,825 --> 00:45:49,894
Take the needle
out of my arm.

852
00:45:49,994 --> 00:45:51,262
Good morning,
Nurse Washington.

853
00:45:51,362 --> 00:45:52,630
How are you today?

854
00:45:52,730 --> 00:45:55,132
You up bright
and early today.

855
00:45:55,232 --> 00:45:56,358
Everybody up!

856
00:45:56,467 --> 00:45:57,833
Good morning, gentlemen.

857
00:45:57,936 --> 00:46:00,166
Let's rise and shine.

858
00:46:00,272 --> 00:46:01,173
Peña!

859
00:46:01,273 --> 00:46:03,175
Can I have
some Aspirin?

860
00:46:03,275 --> 00:46:04,676
I ain't feeling well.

861
00:46:04,776 --> 00:46:06,178
I'd like
some Aspirin.

862
00:46:06,278 --> 00:46:08,180
Hmm. I'll get to you.

863
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:10,683
Leon! How you
doing today?

864
00:46:10,783 --> 00:46:12,185
Look at this shit.

865
00:46:12,285 --> 00:46:13,186
Mm-hmm!

866
00:46:13,286 --> 00:46:14,687
My catheter's
clogged.

867
00:46:14,787 --> 00:46:16,055
Give it a minute.

868
00:46:16,155 --> 00:46:18,391
They're getting
bigger every day.

869
00:46:18,491 --> 00:46:19,826
You don't bother them,

870
00:46:19,926 --> 00:46:21,728
they ain't going
to bother you.

871
00:46:21,828 --> 00:46:23,664
That's why
I'm feeding him.

872
00:46:23,764 --> 00:46:26,633
Keep on feeding him,
and everything'll be fine.

873
00:46:26,733 --> 00:46:28,969
Up and at 'em!
Frankie's here!

874
00:46:29,069 --> 00:46:30,502
Hey, Frankie.
What's up?

875
00:46:30,604 --> 00:46:32,334
Hopkins, come on,
wake up.

876
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:34,203
All you guys,
6:00 special.

877
00:46:34,309 --> 00:46:35,176
Fuck you.

878
00:46:35,276 --> 00:46:37,011
Fenaday,
I'm looking at you.

879
00:46:37,111 --> 00:46:38,446
Keep looking.

880
00:46:38,546 --> 00:46:40,315
My man Kovic.
Up already?

881
00:46:40,415 --> 00:46:41,683
That's good. Let's go.

882
00:46:41,783 --> 00:46:43,518
Let's do it.
Let's go.

883
00:46:43,618 --> 00:46:45,721
Give me a hand over here.

884
00:46:45,821 --> 00:46:47,379
How you doing,
Eddie?

885
00:46:54,630 --> 00:46:58,032
Yeah, you about ready.
Let me have that thing there.

886
00:47:00,670 --> 00:47:02,900
# Hey, where did we go #

887
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:06,240
# Days when
the rains came... ##

888
00:47:06,343 --> 00:47:08,279
I think my stomach
is bloated.

889
00:47:08,379 --> 00:47:09,747
Just take it easy.

890
00:47:09,847 --> 00:47:12,750
Eddie going to take care
of all you boys.

891
00:47:12,850 --> 00:47:14,752
It's like
a car wash.

892
00:47:14,852 --> 00:47:16,087
Bernstein,
what's wrong today?

893
00:47:16,187 --> 00:47:18,589
You got shit up you
ain't coming out.

894
00:47:18,689 --> 00:47:21,026
Stick your head up my ass,
see what the problem is.

895
00:47:21,126 --> 00:47:23,028
Your piss bag's
cloudy, too.

896
00:47:23,128 --> 00:47:25,030
You been drinking
enough water?

897
00:47:25,130 --> 00:47:27,533
You gots to flush
them kidneys every day.

898
00:47:27,633 --> 00:47:29,401
Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah.

899
00:47:29,501 --> 00:47:31,037
Frankie,
I think I'm done.

900
00:47:31,137 --> 00:47:32,405
I think I'm ready.

901
00:47:32,505 --> 00:47:34,541
Are you fucking
with me again?

902
00:47:34,641 --> 00:47:35,842
You better

903
00:47:35,942 --> 00:47:37,705
I'm not
fucking with you.

904
00:47:37,810 --> 00:47:39,712
I'm not fucking

905
00:47:39,812 --> 00:47:41,279
My man Kovic!

906
00:47:42,850 --> 00:47:45,375
Mr. 4th of July.

907
00:47:47,221 --> 00:47:48,455
Politicians,
protesters, and police

908
00:47:48,555 --> 00:47:50,324
are all here in Chicago

909
00:47:50,424 --> 00:47:52,126
for the 1968
Presidential Election.

910
00:47:52,226 --> 00:47:54,161
Chicago police tonight charged
the crowd...

911
00:47:54,261 --> 00:47:56,526
Gook-Iovers.
They ought to die.

912
00:47:57,666 --> 00:47:58,567
Hey! Hey!

913
00:47:58,667 --> 00:48:01,102
There he goes, man.
It's Leon.

914
00:48:01,202 --> 00:48:02,404
Hey!

915
00:48:02,504 --> 00:48:03,939
Hey!

916
00:48:04,039 --> 00:48:05,507
Hey!

917
00:48:05,607 --> 00:48:07,443
They're coming
through the wire!

918
00:48:07,543 --> 00:48:08,578
Hey!

919
00:48:08,678 --> 00:48:10,612
Chieu hoy!
Chieu hoy, Leon.

920
00:48:10,713 --> 00:48:11,975
They're going
to overrun us!

921
00:48:12,081 --> 00:48:12,945
Shut up!

922
00:48:13,049 --> 00:48:14,311
They're going
to overrun us!

923
00:48:14,417 --> 00:48:15,406
Hey, John!

924
00:48:15,518 --> 00:48:18,044
Hey, hey, hey,
chieu hoy, Leon.

925
00:48:18,155 --> 00:48:19,790
Chieu hoy, man!

926
00:48:19,890 --> 00:48:21,792
Shut the fuck up, Leon!

927
00:48:21,892 --> 00:48:24,361
Hit him with
some morphine.

928
00:48:24,461 --> 00:48:27,864
Chicago has an Alice in Wonderland
quality about it.

929
00:48:27,964 --> 00:48:29,934
Things are getting
curiouser and curiouser.

930
00:48:30,034 --> 00:48:33,104
Everywhere you go, there's a sign
reminding you...

931
00:48:33,204 --> 00:48:36,040
Love it or leave it,
you fucking bastards!

932
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:37,801
Hey, you ready, Kovic?

933
00:48:38,843 --> 00:48:40,511
They're burning the flag.

934
00:48:40,611 --> 00:48:43,282
They're fucking burning
the American flag.

935
00:48:43,382 --> 00:48:45,680
Come on.
Let's look alive.

936
00:48:45,784 --> 00:48:47,186
Looking good.
Looking good.

937
00:48:47,286 --> 00:48:49,188
Come on, Kovic.
Real nice.

938
00:48:49,288 --> 00:48:51,724
How many
did I do yesterday?

939
00:48:51,824 --> 00:48:52,725
Three.

940
00:48:52,825 --> 00:48:53,693
Three?

941
00:48:53,793 --> 00:48:55,195
You had enough?

942
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:56,696
Let's do seven.

943
00:48:56,796 --> 00:48:59,666
There you go.
Let's go for seven, then.

944
00:48:59,766 --> 00:49:02,168
Come on, Ronnie.
That a way.

945
00:49:02,268 --> 00:49:04,671
Get up there.
Get up there.

946
00:49:04,771 --> 00:49:07,174
Keep going.
Come on, fucking Marine.

947
00:49:07,274 --> 00:49:09,043
There you go.
Real nice.

948
00:49:09,143 --> 00:49:12,713
# This'll be the day
that I die ##

949
00:49:12,813 --> 00:49:14,715
We want
to make one thing

950
00:49:14,815 --> 00:49:17,185
very clear to you, Ron.

951
00:49:17,285 --> 00:49:20,379
The possibility of your
ever walking is minimal.

952
00:49:21,690 --> 00:49:24,059
Almost impossible.

953
00:49:24,159 --> 00:49:28,063
You're a T-6, paralyzed
from the midchest down.

954
00:49:28,163 --> 00:49:30,500
Probably you'll be
in a wheelchair

955
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:33,467
for the rest
of your life.

956
00:49:35,605 --> 00:49:38,007
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

957
00:49:38,107 --> 00:49:40,377
Well, doctor, will...

958
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:41,535
Hmm?

959
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:46,183
Will I ever be able
to, uh...

960
00:49:46,283 --> 00:49:48,185
to have children?

961
00:49:48,285 --> 00:49:49,411
No.

962
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:53,725
No, but we have a very good
psychologist here.

963
00:49:53,825 --> 00:49:54,849
He's helped...

964
00:49:54,959 --> 00:49:57,862
Oh, I'll walk again.
I know I'll walk again.

965
00:49:57,962 --> 00:49:59,864
Let me
tell you something.

966
00:49:59,964 --> 00:50:02,057
You will never
walk again.

967
00:50:05,304 --> 00:50:06,238
Let's go.

968
00:50:06,338 --> 00:50:08,274
Uhh!

969
00:50:08,374 --> 00:50:09,742
Uhh!

970
00:50:09,842 --> 00:50:12,244
You're walking good
in these things.

971
00:50:12,344 --> 00:50:14,780
What am I
looking like, good?

972
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,249
You're one crazy Marine.

973
00:50:16,349 --> 00:50:17,751
So gung ho,

974
00:50:17,851 --> 00:50:19,219
but you don't know shit

975
00:50:19,319 --> 00:50:21,755
about what's going on
in this country.

976
00:50:21,855 --> 00:50:23,423
Fuck you, Willie.

977
00:50:23,523 --> 00:50:26,426
It ain't about burning the flag
and Vietnam.

978
00:50:26,526 --> 00:50:28,429
Why fight
for rights there?

979
00:50:28,529 --> 00:50:30,865
We ain't got rights
at home.

980
00:50:30,965 --> 00:50:32,867
It's about Detroit
and Newark.

981
00:50:32,967 --> 00:50:34,369
It's about racism, man,

982
00:50:34,469 --> 00:50:37,372
but you can't get
no job at home.

983
00:50:37,472 --> 00:50:40,909
Vietnam's a white man's war,
a rich man's war.

984
00:50:41,009 --> 00:50:42,411
You don't need

985
00:50:42,511 --> 00:50:44,413
You got
to read some books.

986
00:50:44,513 --> 00:50:46,415
There's a revolution
going on.

987
00:50:46,515 --> 00:50:48,917
If you ain't part
of the solution,

988
00:50:49,017 --> 00:50:51,221
then you's part
of the problem.

989
00:50:51,321 --> 00:50:55,158
Jesus Christ, Willie.
Just get my chair for me.

990
00:50:55,258 --> 00:50:58,193
You got to watch
for her.

991
00:50:58,294 --> 00:50:59,454
Oh, man.

992
00:50:59,562 --> 00:51:00,964
Some good weed.

993
00:51:01,064 --> 00:51:02,466
Take the bra off.

994
00:51:02,566 --> 00:51:04,468
I'll give you
another 10.

995
00:51:04,568 --> 00:51:06,126
Why, sure, sugar.

996
00:51:10,441 --> 00:51:11,308
Like this?

997
00:51:11,408 --> 00:51:14,813
Oh, shh! Shh!
Yeah. Yeah.

998
00:51:14,913 --> 00:51:15,814
Suck on my tits.

999
00:51:15,914 --> 00:51:17,349
Honey, anything
you want.

1000
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:18,347
Shh!

1001
00:51:19,417 --> 00:51:20,318
Oh!

1002
00:51:20,418 --> 00:51:21,653
Jesus!

1003
00:51:21,753 --> 00:51:26,492
# I guess you'd say #

1004
00:51:26,592 --> 00:51:31,063
# What could make me
feel this way #

1005
00:51:31,163 --> 00:51:32,562
# My girl #

1006
00:51:32,665 --> 00:51:33,599
# My girl #

1007
00:51:33,699 --> 00:51:34,600
# My girl #

1008
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:37,971
# Talking 'bout my girl #

1009
00:51:38,071 --> 00:51:39,163
# My girl ##

1010
00:51:47,314 --> 00:51:48,816
Good.

1011
00:51:48,916 --> 00:51:49,818
Easy now.

1012
00:51:49,918 --> 00:51:51,510
Easy now.

1013
00:51:52,620 --> 00:51:53,488
Very good.

1014
00:51:53,588 --> 00:51:54,489
Hey, Doc...

1015
00:51:54,589 --> 00:51:56,825
it's really beautiful
up here.

1016
00:51:56,925 --> 00:51:59,189
Ha ha ha!

1017
00:52:05,467 --> 00:52:07,870
I'm walking
out of here, guys.

1018
00:52:07,970 --> 00:52:09,405
You'll see.
Right, Willie?

1019
00:52:09,505 --> 00:52:10,873
Right.

1020
00:52:10,973 --> 00:52:11,907
Easy.

1021
00:52:12,007 --> 00:52:14,678
Oh... I'm all right.
I'm all right.

1022
00:52:14,778 --> 00:52:16,746
O.K. That's enough
for today.

1023
00:52:18,515 --> 00:52:19,883
O.K.
Now, good. Good.

1024
00:52:19,983 --> 00:52:22,919
Easy, now. Easy, now.
Don't go too far.

1025
00:52:23,019 --> 00:52:24,388
Don't do too much.

1026
00:52:24,488 --> 00:52:26,657
Looking good today.
Looking good.

1027
00:52:26,757 --> 00:52:28,259
Don't go too far.

1028
00:52:28,359 --> 00:52:29,227
All right!

1029
00:52:29,327 --> 00:52:31,295
Way to go, Kovic.

1030
00:52:31,395 --> 00:52:32,296
Amazing, huh?

1031
00:52:32,396 --> 00:52:34,298
Nothing from
the chest down.

1032
00:52:34,398 --> 00:52:37,336
It can be done.
It can be done.

1033
00:52:37,436 --> 00:52:39,028
Semper fi, motherfucker!

1034
00:52:39,137 --> 00:52:40,104
All right!

1035
00:52:40,205 --> 00:52:41,607
All right, Harry, man.

1036
00:52:41,707 --> 00:52:43,575
Keep it going. Let's go!

1037
00:52:43,675 --> 00:52:45,444
Let's go. Let's go.

1038
00:52:45,544 --> 00:52:46,645
Let's go.

1039
00:52:46,745 --> 00:52:47,947
Aah!

1040
00:52:48,047 --> 00:52:48,948
Oh!

1041
00:52:49,048 --> 00:52:49,983
Willie!

1042
00:52:50,083 --> 00:52:51,951
I think I need...

1043
00:52:52,051 --> 00:52:53,453
Oh! Oh.

1044
00:52:53,553 --> 00:52:54,988
Get him up.
Somebody...

1045
00:52:55,088 --> 00:52:57,023
Something snapped.
It's my neck.

1046
00:52:57,123 --> 00:52:58,057
All right.

1047
00:52:58,157 --> 00:52:59,592
Just my neck.

1048
00:52:59,692 --> 00:53:01,362
Ah, shit! Harry!

1049
00:53:01,462 --> 00:53:02,897
Hang on. Hang on.

1050
00:53:02,997 --> 00:53:04,164
What was that sound?

1051
00:53:04,264 --> 00:53:05,165
Oh, shit.

1052
00:53:05,265 --> 00:53:06,600
What?

1053
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:07,735
Oh!

1054
00:53:07,835 --> 00:53:09,770
It's fine.
We're doing fine.

1055
00:53:09,870 --> 00:53:11,238
Is that my bone?

1056
00:53:11,338 --> 00:53:13,330
Harry, Harry,
get a doc.

1057
00:53:13,441 --> 00:53:14,809
Am I O.K.?

1058
00:53:14,909 --> 00:53:17,434
It's O.K. Everybody relax.
Harry! Let's go!

1059
00:53:17,545 --> 00:53:18,637
Oh, fuck.

1060
00:53:18,747 --> 00:53:20,578
- Shit.
- Fuck.

1061
00:55:22,148 --> 00:55:23,945
Washington!

1062
00:55:25,684 --> 00:55:27,586
Washington,
where the fuck were you?

1063
00:55:27,686 --> 00:55:30,089
I've been pushing
this call button

1064
00:55:30,189 --> 00:55:33,093
and staring at my own vomit
for two hours.

1065
00:55:33,193 --> 00:55:35,595
What's the matter
with you fucking people?

1066
00:55:35,695 --> 00:55:38,098
I'm laying
in my own shit.

1067
00:55:38,198 --> 00:55:40,634
Why don't you
change the sheets?

1068
00:55:40,734 --> 00:55:42,135
This goddamned fucking place.

1069
00:55:42,235 --> 00:55:43,603
I need a bath.

1070
00:55:43,703 --> 00:55:46,607
Don't be raising
your voice to me!

1071
00:55:46,707 --> 00:55:48,142
You watch your mouth.

1072
00:55:48,242 --> 00:55:50,111
Why don't you help me?

1073
00:55:50,211 --> 00:55:52,113
What's the matter
with you?

1074
00:55:52,213 --> 00:55:53,614
I don't feel right.

1075
00:55:53,714 --> 00:55:56,118
I need to see
the doctor now!

1076
00:55:56,218 --> 00:55:57,653
He's not available now.

1077
00:55:57,753 --> 00:55:59,653
I want to see him now!

1078
00:55:59,755 --> 00:56:01,156
He's always too busy.

1079
00:56:01,256 --> 00:56:02,658
What's eating
you now?

1080
00:56:02,758 --> 00:56:04,660
You going off
the deep end?

1081
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:06,161
We'll amputate
that leg,

1082
00:56:06,261 --> 00:56:08,164
you go on
like this.

1083
00:56:08,264 --> 00:56:10,667
Don't put
your hands on me.

1084
00:56:10,767 --> 00:56:13,203
I want to be treated
like a human being.

1085
00:56:13,303 --> 00:56:15,171
I don't want
any of that shit!

1086
00:56:15,271 --> 00:56:16,673
Trying to
keep me fucking drugged

1087
00:56:16,773 --> 00:56:19,710
so I don't know
what's going on.

1088
00:56:19,810 --> 00:56:21,178
This is a fucking slum.

1089
00:56:21,278 --> 00:56:22,613
We take that leg,

1090
00:56:22,713 --> 00:56:24,648
you're out
in two weeks.

1091
00:56:24,748 --> 00:56:26,150
I want my leg.

1092
00:56:26,250 --> 00:56:28,152
Why?
You can't feel it.

1093
00:56:28,252 --> 00:56:31,123
It's my leg.
I want my leg.

1094
00:56:31,223 --> 00:56:32,656
Can't you
understand that?

1095
00:56:32,757 --> 00:56:35,660
I want to be treated
like a human being.

1096
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:37,696
I fought
for my country.

1097
00:56:37,796 --> 00:56:39,164
I'm a Vietnam veteran!

1098
00:56:39,264 --> 00:56:41,166
I fought
for my country!

1099
00:56:41,266 --> 00:56:42,701
Shut the fuck up!

1100
00:56:42,801 --> 00:56:45,671
I should
be treated decent!

1101
00:56:45,771 --> 00:56:48,641
Vietnam don't mean
nothing to me, man,

1102
00:56:48,741 --> 00:56:51,911
or any of these other people.
You got it?

1103
00:56:52,011 --> 00:56:54,180
You can take
your Vietnam

1104
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:57,217
and shove it up your ass,
you hear?

1105
00:56:57,317 --> 00:56:59,787
No! I don't
need this!

1106
00:56:59,887 --> 00:57:01,255
Hey, you fuck!

1107
00:57:01,355 --> 00:57:04,224
Hey, goddamn you!

1108
00:57:04,324 --> 00:57:05,814
Goddamn it.

1109
00:57:05,926 --> 00:57:07,827
I am a fucking
Vietnam veteran!

1110
00:57:10,064 --> 00:57:10,932
This isn't...

1111
00:57:11,032 --> 00:57:11,966
Marvin!

1112
00:57:12,066 --> 00:57:12,934
Marvin, now!

1113
00:57:13,034 --> 00:57:13,968
Marvin!

1114
00:57:14,068 --> 00:57:15,436
What's up?
What's up?

1115
00:57:15,536 --> 00:57:16,437
Marvin, look!

1116
00:57:16,537 --> 00:57:17,539
Oh, fuck!

1117
00:57:17,639 --> 00:57:18,574
It's off.

1118
00:57:18,674 --> 00:57:20,075
It ain't
going to work.

1119
00:57:20,175 --> 00:57:21,043
Start!

1120
00:57:21,143 --> 00:57:22,511
Washington,
get the doctor.

1121
00:57:22,611 --> 00:57:23,979
Wait a minute.

1122
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:26,649
OK. Yeah.
All right. I will.

1123
00:57:26,749 --> 00:57:28,117
How you doing, Eddie?

1124
00:57:28,217 --> 00:57:30,053
Let's see what's
wrong with this.

1125
00:57:30,153 --> 00:57:33,323
They tell me if we don't
get this pump working,

1126
00:57:33,423 --> 00:57:36,560
they'll cut my leg off.
I want my leg.

1127
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:38,061
Do we have another pump?

1128
00:57:38,161 --> 00:57:40,322
It's the only one, Eddie.

1129
00:57:40,430 --> 00:57:41,766
Ron. It's Ron Kovic.

1130
00:57:41,866 --> 00:57:43,668
Sorry, man. Ron.

1131
00:57:43,768 --> 00:57:46,037
You... You are a doctor?

1132
00:57:46,137 --> 00:57:48,206
It's the Vietnam war.
Cutbacks.

1133
00:57:48,306 --> 00:57:50,474
The government's not giving us
the money we need

1134
00:57:50,574 --> 00:57:52,577
to take care
of you guys.

1135
00:57:52,677 --> 00:57:55,614
We're doing our best.
It's really too bad.

1136
00:57:55,714 --> 00:57:57,082
It's not fair.

1137
00:57:57,182 --> 00:57:59,785
I've tried hard
to keep this leg.

1138
00:57:59,885 --> 00:58:02,821
I've been strapped in
this bed for four months

1139
00:58:02,921 --> 00:58:05,291
so I could
keep this leg.

1140
00:58:05,391 --> 00:58:07,794
Maybe I can rig up
a substitute.

1141
00:58:07,894 --> 00:58:11,798
I'll look in the basement
and see what we got.

1142
00:58:11,898 --> 00:58:13,331
You're coming back?

1143
00:58:13,433 --> 00:58:14,695
Soon.

1144
00:58:14,801 --> 00:58:16,861
Let go, Ron.
Let go.

1145
00:58:18,939 --> 00:58:22,102
We really did try
to help Mr. Kovic.

1146
00:58:52,642 --> 00:59:06,624
Aah!

1147
00:59:06,724 --> 00:59:08,282
Susanne, he's here.

1148
00:59:08,393 --> 00:59:09,553
Ronnie's home.

1149
00:59:17,236 --> 00:59:18,604
O.K. Out on 3.

1150
00:59:18,704 --> 00:59:20,139
All right, 1...

1151
00:59:20,239 --> 00:59:21,140
2...

1152
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:22,041
3.

1153
00:59:22,141 --> 00:59:23,542
Oh, that's great.

1154
00:59:23,642 --> 00:59:26,045
Did you
paint the house, Dad?

1155
00:59:26,145 --> 00:59:27,580
Yeah. I painted it.

1156
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:29,049
Yellow. It looks good.

1157
00:59:29,149 --> 00:59:30,517
It looks pretty good.

1158
00:59:30,617 --> 00:59:33,420
I got that.
That's all right. Let's go.

1159
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:35,920
The kids have been
talking about you.

1160
00:59:36,022 --> 00:59:38,425
They can't wait
to see you.

1161
00:59:38,525 --> 00:59:41,518
It's great to be back
in the neighborhood.

1162
00:59:41,629 --> 00:59:44,031
I got it. I got it.

1163
00:59:44,131 --> 00:59:46,599
Everything looks
so different.

1164
00:59:47,668 --> 00:59:49,003
Major.

1165
00:59:49,103 --> 00:59:50,004
Hey, Major.

1166
00:59:50,104 --> 00:59:52,507
Major, you know
who this is?

1167
00:59:52,607 --> 00:59:53,508
Yeah.

1168
00:59:53,608 --> 00:59:55,510
You know who this is?

1169
00:59:55,610 --> 00:59:57,012
He's gotten old, huh?

1170
00:59:57,112 --> 00:59:59,014
Just like your old man.

1171
00:59:59,114 --> 01:00:00,415
Hey, Tommy.

1172
01:00:00,515 --> 01:00:01,917
Good to see you.

1173
01:00:02,017 --> 01:00:03,119
Look at that hair.

1174
01:00:03,219 --> 01:00:05,621
Dad lets you
look like that?

1175
01:00:05,721 --> 01:00:07,323
I don't have
much say.

1176
01:00:07,423 --> 01:00:08,890
How are you, Jimmy?

1177
01:00:08,991 --> 01:00:11,861
Good to have you home.
You're out for good?

1178
01:00:11,961 --> 01:00:13,396
I'm out for good.

1179
01:00:13,496 --> 01:00:15,766
Patty, gee,
look at you.

1180
01:00:15,866 --> 01:00:16,767
Timmy.

1181
01:00:16,867 --> 01:00:17,735
That's Jackie.

1182
01:00:17,835 --> 01:00:18,736
Jackie?

1183
01:00:18,836 --> 01:00:21,505
I wanted to visit you
in the hospital.

1184
01:00:21,605 --> 01:00:24,475
How many pull-ups
you do, huh?

1185
01:00:24,575 --> 01:00:27,445
You know, I did 23...
23 pull-ups.

1186
01:00:27,545 --> 01:00:29,981
23 pull...
I'm O.K. I'm O.K.

1187
01:00:30,081 --> 01:00:31,816
I'm all right.

1188
01:00:31,916 --> 01:00:32,851
Ronnie.

1189
01:00:32,951 --> 01:00:33,852
Susanne.

1190
01:00:33,952 --> 01:00:35,820
Good to have you home.

1191
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:38,691
You didn't tell me
she was this beautiful.

1192
01:00:38,791 --> 01:00:40,192
She's a woman, huh?

1193
01:00:40,292 --> 01:00:41,224
I'm sorry.

1194
01:00:41,327 --> 01:00:44,230
That's O.K. I can't
feel anything anyway.

1195
01:00:44,330 --> 01:00:45,664
I'm only paralyzed.

1196
01:00:45,764 --> 01:00:47,925
You look great.

1197
01:00:48,033 --> 01:00:49,000
Yeah?

1198
01:00:49,101 --> 01:00:51,872
Ronnie.

1199
01:00:51,972 --> 01:00:53,030
Mom.

1200
01:00:53,940 --> 01:00:54,841
Ronnie.

1201
01:00:54,941 --> 01:00:56,376
Hey, Mom.

1202
01:00:56,476 --> 01:00:58,178
Oh, look at your hair.

1203
01:00:58,278 --> 01:00:59,713
It looks great.

1204
01:00:59,813 --> 01:01:01,182
You like it?

1205
01:01:01,282 --> 01:01:03,084
Oh, you look beautiful.

1206
01:01:03,184 --> 01:01:04,310
Thanks.

1207
01:01:06,787 --> 01:01:08,689
It's good to be home.

1208
01:01:08,789 --> 01:01:10,725
It's better
than seeing me

1209
01:01:10,825 --> 01:01:12,193
at that hospital, huh?

1210
01:01:12,293 --> 01:01:13,695
It's O.K.

1211
01:01:13,795 --> 01:01:15,285
I know.

1212
01:01:15,397 --> 01:01:16,591
I'm O.K.

1213
01:01:16,698 --> 01:01:17,926
I'm O.K.

1214
01:01:18,033 --> 01:01:21,270
It's good to
have you home, Ronnie.

1215
01:01:21,370 --> 01:01:24,206
Gee, everybody
looks so good.

1216
01:01:24,306 --> 01:01:26,502
Everybody looks so good.

1217
01:01:26,643 --> 01:01:30,213
I'm going to go inside
for a minute.

1218
01:01:30,313 --> 01:01:31,714
Mom, wait.

1219
01:01:31,814 --> 01:01:33,183
She'll be O.K.

1220
01:01:33,283 --> 01:01:36,186
Ronnie, how are you, man?
You look good.

1221
01:01:36,286 --> 01:01:37,688
Ronnie,
you look good.

1222
01:01:37,788 --> 01:01:38,689
Welcome home.

1223
01:01:38,789 --> 01:01:41,192
It's so good
to see you.

1224
01:01:41,292 --> 01:01:43,227
Welcome home.
Nice to see you.

1225
01:01:43,327 --> 01:01:45,696
Look at Harry.
You look good.

1226
01:01:45,796 --> 01:01:46,730
Welcome home.

1227
01:01:46,830 --> 01:01:48,822
Let's go in
the house and help.

1228
01:01:51,403 --> 01:01:53,805
Come on, Mom.
It's all right.

1229
01:01:53,905 --> 01:01:54,806
Looks good.

1230
01:01:54,906 --> 01:01:56,168
Yeah?

1231
01:01:58,410 --> 01:01:59,846
You need some help?

1232
01:01:59,946 --> 01:02:01,314
No. I'm O.K., Dad.

1233
01:02:01,414 --> 01:02:04,317
Fixed up a bathroom
for you, Ronnie.

1234
01:02:04,417 --> 01:02:06,819
Put a wider doorway in.

1235
01:02:06,919 --> 01:02:09,822
I built a shower
for you, too.

1236
01:02:09,922 --> 01:02:12,826
You can get in here
pretty easy.

1237
01:02:12,926 --> 01:02:15,329
Oh, and I
put some handles

1238
01:02:15,429 --> 01:02:17,522
on the toilet
for you.

1239
01:02:18,432 --> 01:02:19,366
Ronnie.

1240
01:02:19,466 --> 01:02:20,524
Thanks, Dad.

1241
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:48,887
It's really great
to be back in my room.

1242
01:02:59,510 --> 01:03:01,603
It's good to have you.

1243
01:03:02,980 --> 01:03:05,574
It's good to have you,
Ronnie.

1244
01:03:13,525 --> 01:03:15,425
Come on, I'll show you...

1245
01:03:16,828 --> 01:03:19,765
I'll show you
some new stuff we got

1246
01:03:19,865 --> 01:03:21,924
in the bedroom
over here.

1247
01:03:24,404 --> 01:03:26,739
My Happauge Boyer's grossed
85 grand last six months.

1248
01:03:26,839 --> 01:03:29,776
My competitor's rushing in to build,
but I was first.

1249
01:03:29,876 --> 01:03:31,311
The people are loyal.

1250
01:03:31,411 --> 01:03:33,780
You probably think
it's just a hamburger.

1251
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:36,784
A patty's
just a piece of meat,

1252
01:03:36,884 --> 01:03:38,285
but it can
have character.

1253
01:03:38,385 --> 01:03:39,787
See that doughnut hole?

1254
01:03:39,887 --> 01:03:43,123
Gets 18 patties to the pound
instead of 16.

1255
01:03:43,223 --> 01:03:45,627
Saves me
about $40,000 a year.

1256
01:03:45,727 --> 01:03:46,861
That's serious
money, Ron.

1257
01:03:46,961 --> 01:03:48,363
I plug the hole

1258
01:03:48,463 --> 01:03:50,398
with lettuce, tomatoes,
onions, spices.

1259
01:03:50,498 --> 01:03:52,801
I cover it
with a pickle.

1260
01:03:52,901 --> 01:03:53,802
They'll never
miss a thing.

1261
01:03:53,902 --> 01:03:54,502
They'll never
miss a thing.

1262
01:03:54,602 --> 01:03:57,506
Give me a good one
for Ronnie. Thanks.

1263
01:03:57,606 --> 01:03:59,008
Good job. Try this.

1264
01:03:59,108 --> 01:04:02,044
You don't find that
at McDonald's on Sunrise.

1265
01:04:02,144 --> 01:04:04,408
I got a drive-in
window, too.

1266
01:04:04,513 --> 01:04:05,915
It's Long Island's first.

1267
01:04:06,015 --> 01:04:07,917
It's clean,
it's cheap, it's fast.

1268
01:04:08,017 --> 01:04:09,920
Feed the family
for $3.95.

1269
01:04:10,020 --> 01:04:11,421
Check out these chicks.

1270
01:04:11,521 --> 01:04:13,223
They're wearing
those new miniskirts.

1271
01:04:13,323 --> 01:04:15,692
It's my idea.
It's good for tips.

1272
01:04:15,792 --> 01:04:17,194
The customers
always come back.

1273
01:04:17,294 --> 01:04:18,695
Massapequa's changed.
Watch yourself.

1274
01:04:18,795 --> 01:04:21,699
It's no mom and pop
operation anymore.

1275
01:04:21,799 --> 01:04:23,234
This is our town.

1276
01:04:23,334 --> 01:04:27,205
You're doing a nice job.
Keep up the good work.

1277
01:04:27,305 --> 01:04:28,373
Good.

1278
01:04:28,473 --> 01:04:29,874
Copiague, Ronnie,
Jericho, Bayville,

1279
01:04:29,974 --> 01:04:31,409
Valley Stream, man.

1280
01:04:31,509 --> 01:04:32,911
I want to turn Boyer's

1281
01:04:33,011 --> 01:04:35,381
into a whole
Long Island thing.

1282
01:04:35,481 --> 01:04:38,279
I want you to come
to work for me.

1283
01:04:38,384 --> 01:04:39,752
What can I do?

1284
01:04:39,852 --> 01:04:41,754
This is our town now.

1285
01:04:41,854 --> 01:04:44,758
You're a war hero,
and you can benefit.

1286
01:04:44,858 --> 01:04:46,293
You should benefit,
Ronnie.

1287
01:04:46,393 --> 01:04:47,761
You mean, like partners?

1288
01:04:47,861 --> 01:04:49,763
We open a place
together?

1289
01:04:49,863 --> 01:04:52,265
You got to walk
before you run.

1290
01:04:52,365 --> 01:04:55,268
I could start you out
as a cashier.

1291
01:04:55,368 --> 01:04:57,805
Then you could
learn the business,

1292
01:04:57,905 --> 01:05:00,207
work your way up
to be manager,

1293
01:05:00,307 --> 01:05:02,109
just like your dad.

1294
01:05:02,209 --> 01:05:04,812
I get 1,700 a month
from the government.

1295
01:05:04,912 --> 01:05:06,280
I'll take my time.

1296
01:05:06,380 --> 01:05:08,583
That's charity money.
This isn't.

1297
01:05:08,683 --> 01:05:09,581
Charity?

1298
01:05:09,684 --> 01:05:10,673
Here's your cola.

1299
01:05:10,786 --> 01:05:13,550
You got to put
the war behind you.

1300
01:05:13,655 --> 01:05:15,490
Forget about
this chair you're in.

1301
01:05:15,590 --> 01:05:16,992
Sometimes,
you know, Stevie,

1302
01:05:17,092 --> 01:05:18,493
I think people know

1303
01:05:18,593 --> 01:05:19,996
you're back
from Vietnam,

1304
01:05:20,096 --> 01:05:22,498
and their face changes,
the eyes...

1305
01:05:22,598 --> 01:05:25,535
the voice, the way
they look at you.

1306
01:05:25,635 --> 01:05:27,503
I know, but people here,

1307
01:05:27,603 --> 01:05:30,006
they don't give a shit
about the war.

1308
01:05:30,106 --> 01:05:32,976
It's just a million miles away.
It's all bullshit.

1309
01:05:33,076 --> 01:05:35,946
The government sold us
a bill of goods.

1310
01:05:36,046 --> 01:05:38,816
We got the shit
kicked out of us.

1311
01:05:38,916 --> 01:05:42,477
What do you mean "we"?
You were in college.

1312
01:05:43,588 --> 01:05:46,491
It was you who bought
that communist bullshit.

1313
01:05:46,591 --> 01:05:49,494
Yeah. They were going
to take over the world.

1314
01:05:49,594 --> 01:05:50,995
Do you remember that?

1315
01:05:51,095 --> 01:05:52,497
Finnelli, you, Walsh.

1316
01:05:52,597 --> 01:05:54,499
The whole town
was devastated.

1317
01:05:54,599 --> 01:05:56,302
For what?

1318
01:05:56,402 --> 01:05:57,503
For lies?

1319
01:05:57,603 --> 01:05:59,696
For bullshit lies?

1320
01:06:06,445 --> 01:06:07,881
They burn the flag.

1321
01:06:07,981 --> 01:06:09,349
They demonstrate
against us

1322
01:06:09,449 --> 01:06:11,852
on the cover
of the paper today.

1323
01:06:11,952 --> 01:06:13,353
They have no respect.

1324
01:06:13,453 --> 01:06:14,855
They have no idea

1325
01:06:14,955 --> 01:06:16,855
what's going on
over there

1326
01:06:16,957 --> 01:06:19,188
and the men that are
sacrificing their lives.

1327
01:06:19,293 --> 01:06:20,695
Nobody here
seems to care.

1328
01:06:20,795 --> 01:06:23,564
It's a bunch
of goddamned shit.

1329
01:06:23,664 --> 01:06:27,435
Don't take the Lord's name in vain
in front of the children.

1330
01:06:27,535 --> 01:06:29,737
I agree with
everything you say.

1331
01:06:29,837 --> 01:06:31,240
I served my country.

1332
01:06:31,340 --> 01:06:33,742
They just want
to take from it.

1333
01:06:33,842 --> 01:06:35,744
Love it or leave it.

1334
01:06:35,844 --> 01:06:37,212
The other side's angry

1335
01:06:37,312 --> 01:06:38,714
because
we're not winning.

1336
01:06:38,814 --> 01:06:40,249
How can we win?

1337
01:06:40,349 --> 01:06:41,751
Tommy,
what's the matter?

1338
01:06:41,851 --> 01:06:42,719
Nothing.

1339
01:06:42,819 --> 01:06:44,220
Anybody listening here?
Tommy?

1340
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:45,221
What?

1341
01:06:45,321 --> 01:06:47,157
Tommy's going
to fail English.

1342
01:06:47,257 --> 01:06:49,748
He doesn't believe
in the war.

1343
01:06:50,793 --> 01:06:52,818
What?

1344
01:06:52,929 --> 01:06:55,699
He thinks we're doing
the wrong thing

1345
01:06:55,799 --> 01:06:56,700
over there.

1346
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:59,703
He thinks
it's all a mistake.

1347
01:06:59,803 --> 01:07:02,706
Mistake? What's this?
Spit it out.

1348
01:07:02,806 --> 01:07:04,208
You believe
in demonstrators?

1349
01:07:04,308 --> 01:07:05,377
Huh? What?

1350
01:07:05,477 --> 01:07:08,380
I just don't agree
with everything you're saying.

1351
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:10,382
I don't think
you understand.

1352
01:07:10,482 --> 01:07:12,384
What does
Tommy know?

1353
01:07:12,484 --> 01:07:14,119
I don't understand?

1354
01:07:14,219 --> 01:07:16,121
He's hanging around
with longhairs

1355
01:07:16,221 --> 01:07:17,857
who take drugs!

1356
01:07:17,957 --> 01:07:19,358
That's not the reason.

1357
01:07:19,458 --> 01:07:20,593
Have they ever worked?

1358
01:07:20,693 --> 01:07:22,957
You want to burn the flag?
Huh, Tommy?

1359
01:07:23,062 --> 01:07:24,188
What is this?

1360
01:07:24,297 --> 01:07:26,788
You want to
bring down this country?

1361
01:07:26,899 --> 01:07:29,236
Love it
or leave it, Tommy.

1362
01:07:29,336 --> 01:07:31,205
All they're
trying to say, Ronnie,

1363
01:07:31,305 --> 01:07:33,740
is they don't
want more people

1364
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:35,609
to come back like you.

1365
01:07:35,709 --> 01:07:37,044
That's an easy excuse.

1366
01:07:37,144 --> 01:07:40,380
Where were they when
their country needed them?

1367
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:41,883
You served your country.

1368
01:07:41,983 --> 01:07:44,886
What did you
get out of it?

1369
01:07:44,986 --> 01:07:46,754
Look at you.

1370
01:07:46,854 --> 01:07:49,757
Well, look at me.

1371
01:07:49,857 --> 01:07:51,626
Look at you, man.

1372
01:07:51,726 --> 01:07:54,797
I got to go. I'll see
you around, all right?

1373
01:07:54,897 --> 01:07:56,866
What's wrong
with me, Tommy?

1374
01:07:56,966 --> 01:07:58,695
What's wrong
with me?

1375
01:07:58,801 --> 01:08:00,792
Is there something
wrong with me?

1376
01:08:00,903 --> 01:08:02,271
I volunteered,
Tommy!

1377
01:08:02,371 --> 01:08:05,175
You don't know
what you're talking about!

1378
01:08:05,275 --> 01:08:06,676
Were you there?

1379
01:08:06,776 --> 01:08:10,213
You can just love it
or leave it, Tommy!

1380
01:08:10,313 --> 01:08:11,681
Mom, I can't believe

1381
01:08:11,781 --> 01:08:14,017
what Tommy just
said to me.

1382
01:08:14,117 --> 01:08:15,151
I can't...

1383
01:08:15,251 --> 01:08:18,915
I can't believe
what Tommy just said to me.

1384
01:08:24,862 --> 01:08:26,130
Parade time, Ronnie.

1385
01:08:26,230 --> 01:08:29,826
You tell them I'll be
right there, all right?

1386
01:08:31,269 --> 01:08:34,363
What kind of car is it?

1387
01:08:34,473 --> 01:08:36,031
I think it's
a Continental.

1388
01:08:36,141 --> 01:08:37,199
Continental?

1389
01:08:37,309 --> 01:08:38,333
A convertible?

1390
01:08:38,443 --> 01:08:39,345
Yeah.

1391
01:08:39,445 --> 01:08:41,180
They said
it would be.

1392
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:42,941
Coming up
in the world.

1393
01:08:47,286 --> 01:08:49,556
# Would you
like to ride #

1394
01:08:49,656 --> 01:08:53,193
# In my beautiful
balloon #

1395
01:08:53,293 --> 01:08:55,496
# Would you
like to ride #

1396
01:08:55,596 --> 01:08:58,732
# In my beautiful
balloon #

1397
01:08:58,832 --> 01:09:02,102
# We could float among
the stars together #

1398
01:09:02,202 --> 01:09:04,330
# You and I #

1399
01:09:04,439 --> 01:09:07,636
# For we can fly #

1400
01:09:07,742 --> 01:09:11,178
# We can fly #

1401
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:13,548
# Up, up and away #

1402
01:09:13,648 --> 01:09:15,451
# In my beautiful #

1403
01:09:15,551 --> 01:09:16,752
# My beautiful #

1404
01:09:16,852 --> 01:09:22,984
# Balloon ##

1405
01:09:43,715 --> 01:09:45,114
Die!

1406
01:10:32,467 --> 01:10:36,563
Today is July the 4th,
and I believe in America.

1407
01:10:38,107 --> 01:10:40,200
And I believe
in Americanism.

1408
01:10:41,477 --> 01:10:42,879
But most of all,

1409
01:10:42,979 --> 01:10:45,539
I believe in victory
for America.

1410
01:10:47,350 --> 01:10:50,554
Some people are starting
to say the war is wrong,

1411
01:10:50,654 --> 01:10:52,389
That we shouldn't be there.

1412
01:10:52,489 --> 01:10:55,426
Some people would like to
tear our country down.

1413
01:10:55,526 --> 01:10:57,061
But who are the kids

1414
01:10:57,161 --> 01:10:59,063
defending their right
to protest?

1415
01:10:59,163 --> 01:11:01,066
These are the kids
who care about America,

1416
01:11:01,166 --> 01:11:03,802
kids who have respect
for their flag

1417
01:11:03,902 --> 01:11:06,137
and their parents
and their government

1418
01:11:06,237 --> 01:11:08,640
and their religion.

1419
01:11:08,740 --> 01:11:11,176
Kids like Joey Walsh.

1420
01:11:11,276 --> 01:11:13,145
He was the first.

1421
01:11:13,245 --> 01:11:15,981
We got a street
in the park named after him.

1422
01:11:16,081 --> 01:11:17,349
And Danny Topinka,

1423
01:11:17,449 --> 01:11:20,653
Billy Vorsovich,

1424
01:11:20,753 --> 01:11:22,421
Phil and Larry Powell,

1425
01:11:22,521 --> 01:11:24,124
Tommy Finnelli.

1426
01:11:24,224 --> 01:11:27,661
Six boys from Massapequa...

1427
01:11:27,761 --> 01:11:29,162
and they all knew

1428
01:11:29,262 --> 01:11:32,499
what honor, duty,
and sacrifice meant.

1429
01:11:32,599 --> 01:11:34,668
They paid
the highest price.

1430
01:11:34,768 --> 01:11:36,737
They died for it.

1431
01:11:38,272 --> 01:11:40,541
This town's
been hit hard.

1432
01:11:40,641 --> 01:11:42,700
It's always
been hit hard.

1433
01:11:42,810 --> 01:11:45,713
Doc here, he was
in the First War.

1434
01:11:45,813 --> 01:11:48,874
A lot of us here
were in the Second.

1435
01:11:48,984 --> 01:11:51,043
That's why
we can't give up.

1436
01:11:51,153 --> 01:11:54,247
That's why we're going to
win in Vietnam.

1437
01:11:56,425 --> 01:11:59,696
Because Massapequa's
been there before,

1438
01:11:59,796 --> 01:12:02,866
because of those
six wonderful boys,

1439
01:12:02,966 --> 01:12:05,835
and because of him.

1440
01:12:05,935 --> 01:12:07,137
Ron...

1441
01:12:07,237 --> 01:12:09,973
come say a few words,
would you, please?

1442
01:12:10,073 --> 01:12:11,642
Ron Kovic,
ladies and gentlemen.

1443
01:12:11,742 --> 01:12:14,645
He was born
on the 4th of July, 1946.

1444
01:12:14,745 --> 01:12:18,340
Give him a big hand
on his great birthday.

1445
01:12:26,892 --> 01:12:29,995
I just want to say
for the guys in Vietnam

1446
01:12:30,095 --> 01:12:31,463
that we're doing our best.

1447
01:12:31,563 --> 01:12:34,333
It's not an easy situation,

1448
01:12:34,433 --> 01:12:39,806
but the boys' morale
over there is real high,

1449
01:12:39,906 --> 01:12:42,308
and you can feel
confident that we are...

1450
01:12:42,408 --> 01:12:44,876
we are going to
win that war.

1451
01:12:50,817 --> 01:12:52,686
I served my country,

1452
01:12:52,786 --> 01:12:56,190
and I don't want you
to feel sorry for me.

1453
01:12:56,290 --> 01:12:58,193
Do not shed a tear.

1454
01:12:58,293 --> 01:13:02,397
I have my hands,
my eyes, my ears...

1455
01:13:02,497 --> 01:13:03,930
I have my heart...

1456
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:07,235
and I have...

1457
01:13:07,335 --> 01:13:08,768
what I feel...

1458
01:13:15,277 --> 01:13:17,613
I have what I feel is...

1459
01:13:17,713 --> 01:13:19,874
an unquen... quenchable...

1460
01:13:54,019 --> 01:13:55,420
O.K. It's O.K., Ronnie.

1461
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:57,113
It's O.K., kid.

1462
01:13:59,826 --> 01:14:01,259
I'm sorry.

1463
01:14:02,428 --> 01:14:03,452
I'm sorry.

1464
01:14:07,734 --> 01:14:09,470
And we'll
continue to fight

1465
01:14:09,570 --> 01:14:12,232
because of guys
like Ron Kovic...

1466
01:14:14,108 --> 01:14:15,476
Dad, where's the car?

1467
01:14:15,576 --> 01:14:16,977
It's across
the street.

1468
01:14:17,077 --> 01:14:18,479
Like he said,

1469
01:14:18,579 --> 01:14:19,915
we're going to
win that war.

1470
01:14:20,015 --> 01:14:21,277
Ronnie.

1471
01:14:22,183 --> 01:14:23,707
Ronnie.

1472
01:14:28,890 --> 01:14:30,118
Timmy?

1473
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:32,995
Timmy, man?

1474
01:14:33,095 --> 01:14:34,153
Timmy!

1475
01:14:34,263 --> 01:14:36,165
I heard you were...

1476
01:14:36,265 --> 01:14:37,633
When did you get back?

1477
01:14:37,733 --> 01:14:39,826
When did you get out?

1478
01:14:43,407 --> 01:14:44,499
Wow, man.

1479
01:14:48,512 --> 01:14:50,447
Let's get the hell
out of here.

1480
01:14:50,547 --> 01:14:51,415
Mr. Kovic?

1481
01:14:51,515 --> 01:14:53,415
Yeah. Sure.

1482
01:15:01,592 --> 01:15:04,083
Antiwar demonstrators have come
to Washington, D.C.

1483
01:15:04,195 --> 01:15:06,064
To shut the city down.

1484
01:15:06,164 --> 01:15:08,258
...and Martin's
Laugh In,

1485
01:15:08,367 --> 01:15:11,393
starring Dan Rowan
and Dick Martin,

1486
01:15:11,503 --> 01:15:14,406
with Sammy Davis, Jr.

1487
01:15:14,506 --> 01:15:16,275
And Judy Carne...

1488
01:15:16,375 --> 01:15:17,443
Honey.

1489
01:15:17,543 --> 01:15:19,446
Come on.
It's starting.

1490
01:15:19,546 --> 01:15:20,747
O.K. I'm coming.

1491
01:15:20,847 --> 01:15:22,682
It's the one
with Sammy Davis.

1492
01:15:22,782 --> 01:15:23,874
Oh, yeah?

1493
01:15:26,953 --> 01:15:28,722
Who else
used to play?

1494
01:15:28,822 --> 01:15:30,224
Come on, Ronnie.

1495
01:15:30,324 --> 01:15:32,360
No. Come on.
Tell me who.

1496
01:15:32,460 --> 01:15:33,527
Bobby Moore
at shortstop.

1497
01:15:33,627 --> 01:15:34,829
Grady Rogers
at third.

1498
01:15:34,929 --> 01:15:37,557
Grady got sick.
It was Finnelli at third.

1499
01:15:37,665 --> 01:15:38,566
Tommy Finnelli.

1500
01:15:38,666 --> 01:15:39,724
Yeah.

1501
01:15:41,168 --> 01:15:44,627
Got hit with one
of his own mortars.

1502
01:15:44,739 --> 01:15:46,297
That's crazy, man.

1503
01:15:46,408 --> 01:15:48,810
Shit, I heard
about that.

1504
01:15:48,910 --> 01:15:51,513
Remember the twins,
Phil and Larry Powell?

1505
01:15:51,613 --> 01:15:52,814
Oh, the twins. Oh.

1506
01:15:52,914 --> 01:15:54,183
They were great
wrestlers.

1507
01:15:54,283 --> 01:15:57,020
Oh, man.
They were fucking great.

1508
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:57,987
Tough.

1509
01:15:58,087 --> 01:15:58,988
Tough bastards.

1510
01:15:59,088 --> 01:16:00,289
When Phil
got killed,

1511
01:16:00,389 --> 01:16:03,326
Larry... who wasn't much
for brains either...

1512
01:16:03,426 --> 01:16:05,696
went down the next day
and joined up.

1513
01:16:05,796 --> 01:16:06,697
Oh, God.

1514
01:16:06,797 --> 01:16:07,998
Then he got hit.

1515
01:16:08,098 --> 01:16:09,033
Oh, no.

1516
01:16:09,133 --> 01:16:10,031
It's true.

1517
01:16:10,134 --> 01:16:12,036
A land mine
or something.

1518
01:16:12,136 --> 01:16:15,539
He got hit in the head
with a tree.

1519
01:16:15,639 --> 01:16:17,542
Yeah. I'm telling
you the truth.

1520
01:16:17,642 --> 01:16:19,377
He goes
over to Vietnam,

1521
01:16:19,477 --> 01:16:22,547
and he gets killed
by a flying fucking tree.

1522
01:16:22,647 --> 01:16:24,549
Oh.

1523
01:16:24,649 --> 01:16:26,051
That's really fucking funny.

1524
01:16:26,151 --> 01:16:29,555
I think the whole
town got devastated, Ronnie.

1525
01:16:29,655 --> 01:16:33,592
I don't think
we got a friend left.

1526
01:16:33,692 --> 01:16:35,250
It's really funny.

1527
01:16:41,668 --> 01:16:44,262
When did you
get hit, Timmy?

1528
01:16:47,541 --> 01:16:49,099
September the 18th.

1529
01:16:50,210 --> 01:16:51,973
Near Dong Ha.

1530
01:16:54,048 --> 01:16:56,484
A lot of bad shit
up there, Ronnie,

1531
01:16:56,584 --> 01:16:57,785
I'm telling you.

1532
01:16:57,885 --> 01:17:00,121
Things I don't
even want to talk about.

1533
01:17:00,221 --> 01:17:01,789
You know.

1534
01:17:01,889 --> 01:17:04,125
I mean, uh...

1535
01:17:04,225 --> 01:17:05,818
it was crazy.

1536
01:17:07,062 --> 01:17:08,964
Shooting
anything that...

1537
01:17:09,064 --> 01:17:11,658
anything that fucking moved,
you know?

1538
01:17:15,771 --> 01:17:18,832
When did you...
When did you get hit?

1539
01:17:18,942 --> 01:17:19,843
Me?

1540
01:17:19,943 --> 01:17:21,344
Well...

1541
01:17:21,444 --> 01:17:24,147
Uh, January 20th.
Yes.

1542
01:17:24,247 --> 01:17:26,816
Someplace off... I don't
even remember.

1543
01:17:26,916 --> 01:17:28,285
Up in the DMZ.

1544
01:17:28,385 --> 01:17:30,654
Walked into
a whole battalion of them.

1545
01:17:30,754 --> 01:17:32,456
Got shot
in the foot.

1546
01:17:32,556 --> 01:17:34,825
I got up
like I was...

1547
01:17:34,925 --> 01:17:36,660
back in the woods again,

1548
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:38,629
like I was
John fucking Wayne,

1549
01:17:38,729 --> 01:17:41,500
emptying a mag, screaming,
"Come on, Charlie, motherfucker!

1550
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:43,502
Come on out,
Charlie, motherfucker!"

1551
01:17:43,602 --> 01:17:45,160
Rat-tat-tat-tat.

1552
01:17:46,238 --> 01:17:48,974
I heard this crack
above my right ear,

1553
01:17:49,074 --> 01:17:51,509
and I just
felt my body...

1554
01:17:51,611 --> 01:17:54,842
drop out from under me.

1555
01:17:54,947 --> 01:17:58,217
Well, I thought
I was dead for sure.

1556
01:17:58,317 --> 01:17:59,685
Was the, uh...

1557
01:17:59,785 --> 01:18:01,220
How was
the hospital?

1558
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:02,188
It sucked.

1559
01:18:02,288 --> 01:18:03,190
I know.

1560
01:18:03,290 --> 01:18:04,191
Really bad.

1561
01:18:04,291 --> 01:18:06,360
I'll tell you
something, Ronnie...

1562
01:18:06,460 --> 01:18:08,695
Sometimes
at night...

1563
01:18:08,795 --> 01:18:11,565
I get these
headaches, you know?

1564
01:18:11,665 --> 01:18:13,600
They're bad.

1565
01:18:13,700 --> 01:18:14,434
And, uh...

1566
01:18:14,534 --> 01:18:16,337
they just kind of
come over me,

1567
01:18:16,437 --> 01:18:19,674
and these doctors
don't know shit, you know.

1568
01:18:19,774 --> 01:18:23,301
They just come,
like I'm going crazy or something.

1569
01:18:24,746 --> 01:18:29,151
I don't feel... I don't feel
like me anymore, you know?

1570
01:18:29,251 --> 01:18:31,153
I feel like...
when they come,

1571
01:18:31,253 --> 01:18:33,155
I feel like
somebody else.

1572
01:18:33,255 --> 01:18:34,657
What do you do?

1573
01:18:34,757 --> 01:18:37,660
Nothing. Not a goddamned
thing, you know?

1574
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:41,857
Well... mostly I do
a lot of drugs.

1575
01:18:43,933 --> 01:18:46,203
Do anything
you can, you know?

1576
01:18:46,303 --> 01:18:49,874
Y-You get through it
any way you can.

1577
01:18:49,974 --> 01:18:52,176
When I was
in the hospital,

1578
01:18:52,276 --> 01:18:55,370
I thought, "Yeah.
Yeah, this makes sense."

1579
01:18:56,447 --> 01:18:58,182
What makes sense?

1580
01:18:58,282 --> 01:19:00,910
'Cause I failed, Timmy.

1581
01:19:01,018 --> 01:19:03,044
What are you
talking about?

1582
01:19:05,824 --> 01:19:07,726
'Cause I...

1583
01:19:07,826 --> 01:19:10,729
'Cause I killed someone...
some people. I...

1584
01:19:10,829 --> 01:19:13,833
I made some terrible...

1585
01:19:13,933 --> 01:19:14,968
mistakes.

1586
01:19:15,068 --> 01:19:18,504
Ronnie, we all made mistakes.
I mean, you...

1587
01:19:18,604 --> 01:19:19,739
you had no choice.

1588
01:19:19,839 --> 01:19:21,241
Those damn pansy
demonstrators

1589
01:19:21,341 --> 01:19:23,276
will never
understand.

1590
01:19:23,376 --> 01:19:24,677
Don't talk about it.

1591
01:19:24,777 --> 01:19:26,714
It was insane
over there.

1592
01:19:26,814 --> 01:19:29,374
Sometimes I wish...
I wish I'd...

1593
01:19:30,451 --> 01:19:32,686
When I got shot
in the foot,

1594
01:19:32,786 --> 01:19:34,549
I could have laid down.

1595
01:19:34,655 --> 01:19:38,092
Who gives a fuck now
if I was a hero or not?

1596
01:19:38,193 --> 01:19:40,562
I was paralyzed,
castrated that day. Why?

1597
01:19:40,662 --> 01:19:43,765
'Cause I was so s...
stupid.

1598
01:19:43,865 --> 01:19:47,858
I have my dick and my balls now
and I think...

1599
01:19:49,638 --> 01:19:53,442
I think, Timmy,
I'd give everything I believe in,

1600
01:19:53,542 --> 01:19:55,645
everything I got...
all my values

1601
01:19:55,745 --> 01:19:57,613
just to have
my body again,

1602
01:19:57,713 --> 01:19:59,649
just to be whole again.

1603
01:19:59,749 --> 01:20:01,118
But I'm not whole.

1604
01:20:01,218 --> 01:20:03,453
I never will be,
and that's...

1605
01:20:03,553 --> 01:20:06,317
the way it is,
isn't it?

1606
01:20:08,058 --> 01:20:09,116
Ronnie...

1607
01:20:09,226 --> 01:20:10,661
it's your birthday.

1608
01:20:10,761 --> 01:20:13,094
You're alive.

1609
01:20:15,867 --> 01:20:17,425
You made it.

1610
01:20:18,403 --> 01:20:20,200
Smile.

1611
01:20:29,448 --> 01:20:32,884
Syracuse, New York,
our next stop.

1612
01:21:06,555 --> 01:21:08,223
# Oh, where
have you been #

1613
01:21:08,323 --> 01:21:11,054
# My blue-eyed son #

1614
01:21:13,563 --> 01:21:15,465
# Oh, where
have you been #

1615
01:21:15,565 --> 01:21:18,056
# My darling young one #

1616
01:21:19,502 --> 01:21:21,137
# I've walked
and I've crawled #

1617
01:21:21,237 --> 01:21:24,366
# On six
crooked highways #

1618
01:21:25,542 --> 01:21:27,378
# I've been
out in front #

1619
01:21:27,478 --> 01:21:30,379
# Of a dozen dead oceans #

1620
01:21:31,548 --> 01:21:33,650
# I've been 10,000 miles #

1621
01:21:33,750 --> 01:21:36,618
# In the mouth
of a graveyard #

1622
01:21:37,622 --> 01:21:39,724
# And it's a hard #

1623
01:21:39,824 --> 01:21:41,726
# It's a hard #

1624
01:21:41,826 --> 01:21:43,728
# It's a hard #

1625
01:21:43,828 --> 01:21:45,797
# It's a hard #

1626
01:21:45,897 --> 01:21:49,095
# It's a hard rain #

1627
01:21:49,201 --> 01:21:51,669
# That's gonna fall #

1628
01:21:54,773 --> 01:21:56,108
# Who did you meet #

1629
01:21:56,208 --> 01:21:58,575
# My blue-eyed son... ##

1630
01:22:03,583 --> 01:22:05,852
Those long letters
I wrote you

1631
01:22:05,952 --> 01:22:07,320
from over there?

1632
01:22:07,420 --> 01:22:08,822
Crazy stuff, huh?

1633
01:22:08,922 --> 01:22:10,324
That's all right.

1634
01:22:10,424 --> 01:22:11,692
I had to say everything

1635
01:22:11,792 --> 01:22:14,695
I couldn't say
when we were growing up.

1636
01:22:14,795 --> 01:22:16,330
They were
beautiful letters.

1637
01:22:16,430 --> 01:22:17,331
Yeah?

1638
01:22:17,431 --> 01:22:18,833
Yeah.

1639
01:22:18,933 --> 01:22:21,870
I wasn't too sure
about the spelling in them.

1640
01:22:21,970 --> 01:22:24,734
Who cares
if you can spell?

1641
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:26,967
There was...

1642
01:22:27,075 --> 01:22:30,670
There was a lot of feeling
in the words.

1643
01:22:32,581 --> 01:22:36,085
I'm so sorry for what happened
to you, Ronnie.

1644
01:22:36,185 --> 01:22:40,623
My mom called me
at school and told me.

1645
01:22:40,723 --> 01:22:42,714
I was just
so shocked.

1646
01:22:43,626 --> 01:22:46,163
I... I wanted to...

1647
01:22:46,263 --> 01:22:48,390
reach out
and help you.

1648
01:22:50,401 --> 01:22:51,869
But...

1649
01:22:51,969 --> 01:22:53,732
it was just
so frustrating,

1650
01:22:53,837 --> 01:22:54,895
I just...

1651
01:22:55,005 --> 01:22:58,965
stood in the hallway
of my dorm room shaking.

1652
01:22:59,077 --> 01:23:01,170
I couldn't
say anything.

1653
01:23:02,147 --> 01:23:03,248
Donna...

1654
01:23:03,348 --> 01:23:05,951
uh, they need you
over at Locklin.

1655
01:23:06,051 --> 01:23:08,186
I can't right now,
Jeff. Later.

1656
01:23:08,286 --> 01:23:10,423
Well, don't forget
about the meeting.

1657
01:23:10,523 --> 01:23:11,591
Yeah, 9:00?

1658
01:23:11,691 --> 01:23:13,283
Yeah. Thanks.

1659
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:15,461
I'm sorry.

1660
01:23:15,561 --> 01:23:16,896
You're real busy, huh?

1661
01:23:16,996 --> 01:23:19,599
We've got this Kent State
demonstration tomorrow.

1662
01:23:19,699 --> 01:23:21,268
I'm on the organizing
committee.

1663
01:23:21,368 --> 01:23:23,604
Kent State.
I heard about that.

1664
01:23:23,704 --> 01:23:25,138
It was... Jesus...
terrible.

1665
01:23:25,238 --> 01:23:26,173
It's terrible.

1666
01:23:26,273 --> 01:23:28,571
When I saw that girl

1667
01:23:28,675 --> 01:23:31,612
lying in that pool of blood
at Kent State,

1668
01:23:31,712 --> 01:23:34,082
I kept on thinking
of that poster

1669
01:23:34,182 --> 01:23:36,851
of the children
that were killed at My Lai.

1670
01:23:36,951 --> 01:23:40,388
And I kept on thinking
about you over there...

1671
01:23:40,488 --> 01:23:42,857
and all the boys
who've died,

1672
01:23:42,957 --> 01:23:47,796
who've sacrificed
their bodies and...

1673
01:23:47,896 --> 01:23:49,454
and their minds.

1674
01:23:50,532 --> 01:23:52,468
The war is
so wrong, Ronnie.

1675
01:23:52,568 --> 01:23:53,936
It's so wrong.

1676
01:23:54,036 --> 01:23:56,198
I just had to
do something.

1677
01:23:58,908 --> 01:24:03,641
# We don't need arms #

1678
01:24:03,747 --> 01:24:08,276
# We need hands to hold #

1679
01:24:09,620 --> 01:24:14,258
# And we
don't need bombs... ##

1680
01:24:14,358 --> 01:24:16,827
Strike now,
shut it down!

1681
01:24:16,927 --> 01:24:19,665
Strike now,
shut it down!

1682
01:24:19,765 --> 01:24:21,667
Strike now,
shut it down!

1683
01:24:21,767 --> 01:24:25,003
You know, Ronnie,
I'm not saying that you are,

1684
01:24:25,103 --> 01:24:28,307
but if you have any feelings
against the war,

1685
01:24:28,407 --> 01:24:30,777
you could really help.

1686
01:24:30,877 --> 01:24:32,779
I mean,
you've been there.

1687
01:24:32,879 --> 01:24:34,447
You know
what it's like.

1688
01:24:34,547 --> 01:24:36,811
You could tell people
what's happening,

1689
01:24:36,916 --> 01:24:39,476
and they'd really
listen to you.

1690
01:24:42,456 --> 01:24:44,014
Remember the prom?

1691
01:24:44,124 --> 01:24:46,160
# Moon River #

1692
01:24:46,260 --> 01:24:47,995
# Wider than the sea #

1693
01:24:48,095 --> 01:24:50,364
# My huckleberry
friend... #

1694
01:24:50,464 --> 01:24:51,332
Remember that?

1695
01:24:51,432 --> 01:24:52,333
Yeah.

1696
01:24:52,433 --> 01:24:54,026
# Moon River
for me ##

1697
01:24:55,103 --> 01:24:57,939
Boy, was I crazy
that night.

1698
01:24:58,039 --> 01:25:01,843
I just had to dance with you
before I went in.

1699
01:25:01,943 --> 01:25:04,112
It was like I knew.

1700
01:25:04,212 --> 01:25:08,217
I made a promise to myself
that I would come back

1701
01:25:08,317 --> 01:25:10,046
and love you
forever.

1702
01:25:10,152 --> 01:25:11,813
Donna.
Hey, Donna.

1703
01:25:11,921 --> 01:25:12,822
Yeah?

1704
01:25:12,922 --> 01:25:15,049
The Reverend
can't make it tomorrow.

1705
01:25:15,157 --> 01:25:16,058
What?

1706
01:25:16,158 --> 01:25:17,394
He can't make it.

1707
01:25:17,494 --> 01:25:18,395
Oh.

1708
01:25:18,495 --> 01:25:20,897
What can we do?
Who can we get?

1709
01:25:20,997 --> 01:25:23,734
Just let me think.
I'll see you later.

1710
01:25:23,834 --> 01:25:24,735
Better hurry.

1711
01:25:24,835 --> 01:25:26,359
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

1712
01:25:27,771 --> 01:25:30,808
Ronnie, I got to...
I got to go inside.

1713
01:25:30,908 --> 01:25:32,967
Do you want to come?

1714
01:25:35,613 --> 01:25:37,081
No, I don't
think so.

1715
01:25:37,181 --> 01:25:38,239
O.K.

1716
01:25:39,851 --> 01:25:40,978
O.K.

1717
01:25:43,055 --> 01:25:44,249
Maybe I'll
hang around.

1718
01:25:44,356 --> 01:25:46,085
Maybe we'll
talk later.

1719
01:25:47,860 --> 01:25:50,420
All right.
I'll see you later.

1720
01:26:08,649 --> 01:26:10,251
1, 2, 3, 4!

1721
01:26:10,351 --> 01:26:11,952
We don't want
your fucking war!

1722
01:26:12,052 --> 01:26:14,922
1, 2, 3, 4! We don't want
your fucking war!

1723
01:26:15,022 --> 01:26:18,288
1, 2, 3, 4!
We don't want your fucking war!

1724
01:26:18,393 --> 01:26:20,088
All right! Wow!

1725
01:26:20,195 --> 01:26:24,723
It's great to be at free
Syracuse University!

1726
01:26:28,037 --> 01:26:31,438
We're really getting
an education now, aren't we?

1727
01:26:32,775 --> 01:26:34,444
Right on, man!
Right on!

1728
01:26:34,544 --> 01:26:35,912
Right freaking on!

1729
01:26:36,012 --> 01:26:38,247
Yesterday I was at
Brooklyn College...

1730
01:26:38,347 --> 01:26:40,984
NYU... they were both
closed down!

1731
01:26:41,084 --> 01:26:43,687
Over 200 high schools
are closed down.

1732
01:26:43,787 --> 01:26:46,090
Over 400 universities
are closed down.

1733
01:26:46,190 --> 01:26:49,353
It'll be twice that number
by the time...

1734
01:26:51,161 --> 01:26:54,399
This is an unlawful
assembly.

1735
01:26:54,499 --> 01:26:57,702
If you do not
disperse...

1736
01:26:57,802 --> 01:27:00,405
The people that killed
the kids at Kent State

1737
01:27:00,505 --> 01:27:02,939
have names like
General Waste-more-land!

1738
01:27:04,610 --> 01:27:07,813
Spiro Agnew!

1739
01:27:07,913 --> 01:27:11,474
Tricky Dicky Nixon!

1740
01:27:13,018 --> 01:27:15,689
Wait for the command.

1741
01:27:15,789 --> 01:27:17,758
And then we go
to Washington,

1742
01:27:17,858 --> 01:27:21,394
confront the war makers
in their own house!

1743
01:27:21,494 --> 01:27:22,763
On to Washington!

1744
01:27:22,863 --> 01:27:24,956
On to the White House!

1745
01:27:31,138 --> 01:27:34,301
I loved
this country once.

1746
01:27:34,408 --> 01:27:36,344
And all this
I won over there.

1747
01:27:36,444 --> 01:27:37,812
Check it out...

1748
01:27:37,912 --> 01:27:41,583
Purple Heart,
Bronze Star,

1749
01:27:41,683 --> 01:27:43,118
all the commendation
medals,

1750
01:27:43,218 --> 01:27:45,621
all the rest
of that garbage.

1751
01:27:45,721 --> 01:27:47,089
It don't mean a thing.

1752
01:27:47,189 --> 01:27:48,924
Fuck this...

1753
01:27:49,024 --> 01:27:50,822
shit!

1754
01:27:54,130 --> 01:27:55,465
This is war!

1755
01:27:55,565 --> 01:27:57,499
I said this is war!

1756
01:27:57,600 --> 01:28:00,904
They just killed two brothers
at Jackson State!

1757
01:28:01,004 --> 01:28:02,973
Stand by to gas!

1758
01:28:08,445 --> 01:28:10,310
Take them down!

1759
01:28:21,126 --> 01:28:23,594
What's going on?

1760
01:28:24,529 --> 01:28:26,933
Get out!
Get out of here!

1761
01:28:27,033 --> 01:28:28,401
Get out of here!

1762
01:28:28,501 --> 01:28:29,832
Get back! Get back!

1763
01:28:39,780 --> 01:28:40,974
Donna!

1764
01:28:49,924 --> 01:28:51,259
The whole world's
watching!

1765
01:28:51,359 --> 01:28:52,627
The whole world's
watching!

1766
01:28:52,727 --> 01:28:54,596
The whole world's
watching!

1767
01:28:54,696 --> 01:28:56,531
The whole world's
watching!

1768
01:28:56,631 --> 01:28:58,032
The whole world's
watching!

1769
01:28:58,132 --> 01:28:59,565
The whole world's
watching!

1770
01:28:59,901 --> 01:29:08,978
Donna!

1771
01:29:09,078 --> 01:29:13,038
# Now, when I was just
a little boy #

1772
01:29:13,149 --> 01:29:16,887
# I stand up
to my daddy's knee #

1773
01:29:16,987 --> 01:29:20,824
# My papa said, son,
don't let the man get you #

1774
01:29:20,924 --> 01:29:24,362
# The way that
he done to me #

1775
01:29:24,462 --> 01:29:27,031
# 'Cause
he'll get you now... #

1776
01:29:27,131 --> 01:29:28,065
He says...

1777
01:29:28,165 --> 01:29:29,200
# No, he'll get you... #

1778
01:29:29,300 --> 01:29:30,701
My machine breaks down,

1779
01:29:30,801 --> 01:29:33,738
and they're ready
to cut my leg off.

1780
01:29:33,838 --> 01:29:35,706
And that's what the guy...

1781
01:29:35,806 --> 01:29:38,710
Now, that's what the guy
in the hospital said.

1782
01:29:38,810 --> 01:29:40,779
He said, "You can
take your Vietnam,

1783
01:29:40,879 --> 01:29:43,248
and you can stuff it up your ass,"
he said.

1784
01:29:43,348 --> 01:29:46,151
That's what it's
about in Vietnam.

1785
01:29:46,251 --> 01:29:48,154
Hey, Mel!
Double shot of rye,

1786
01:29:48,254 --> 01:29:49,656
beer chaser,
sweetheart!

1787
01:29:49,756 --> 01:29:52,091
They ain't fighting
the war to win, anyway.

1788
01:29:52,191 --> 01:29:54,127
They should
just bomb Hanoi

1789
01:29:54,227 --> 01:29:57,096
and get the boys
the fuck out of there.

1790
01:29:57,196 --> 01:29:58,765
Four corner hard way.

1791
01:29:58,865 --> 01:30:00,067
Fuckin'-A.

1792
01:30:00,167 --> 01:30:01,498
Vietnam.

1793
01:30:02,669 --> 01:30:04,071
Vietnam.

1794
01:30:04,171 --> 01:30:06,073
They ought
to write a song

1795
01:30:06,173 --> 01:30:08,609
about something
that gets under your skin.

1796
01:30:08,709 --> 01:30:10,110
Remember Del Shannon?

1797
01:30:10,210 --> 01:30:11,346
Runaway?

1798
01:30:11,446 --> 01:30:13,539
# As I walk along #

1799
01:30:13,648 --> 01:30:16,378
# I wonder
what went wrong #

1800
01:30:16,484 --> 01:30:18,853
# To our love #

1801
01:30:18,953 --> 01:30:21,556
# A love
that was so strong #

1802
01:30:21,656 --> 01:30:23,059
# Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa #

1803
01:30:23,159 --> 01:30:25,061
# I'll tell you
what went wrong #

1804
01:30:25,161 --> 01:30:28,331
# It was fucking Vietnam ##

1805
01:30:28,431 --> 01:30:30,399
It was the wrong fucking war.

1806
01:30:30,499 --> 01:30:33,302
Timmy, it was
the wrong fucking war.

1807
01:30:33,402 --> 01:30:35,439
Take a shot, will you?

1808
01:30:35,539 --> 01:30:37,441
You can take
your Vietnam,

1809
01:30:37,541 --> 01:30:41,511
and you can shove it
up yo' fuckin' ass!

1810
01:30:41,611 --> 01:30:44,047
You shove it
up your ass, pal.

1811
01:30:44,147 --> 01:30:46,083
Is everybody
supposed to feel sorry

1812
01:30:46,183 --> 01:30:48,653
because you're in
a fucking wheelchair?

1813
01:30:48,753 --> 01:30:50,721
You ain't the only
fucking Marine here.

1814
01:30:50,822 --> 01:30:52,190
I was on Iwo Jima.

1815
01:30:52,290 --> 01:30:54,625
We lost 5,000 men
the first day.

1816
01:30:54,725 --> 01:30:57,562
Don't cry in your
fucking beer to me.

1817
01:30:57,662 --> 01:30:59,064
Now, you served
and you lost.

1818
01:30:59,164 --> 01:31:00,566
You got to live
with it.

1819
01:31:00,666 --> 01:31:02,067
You're a Marine, man.

1820
01:31:02,167 --> 01:31:03,035
Semper fi.

1821
01:31:03,135 --> 01:31:05,537
Picked them. They
didn't pick you.

1822
01:31:05,637 --> 01:31:08,440
Quit your fucking
pissing and moaning.

1823
01:31:08,540 --> 01:31:11,978
Timmy, Timmy,
who is this asshole?

1824
01:31:12,078 --> 01:31:13,980
I don't know.
Leave it alone.

1825
01:31:14,080 --> 01:31:15,672
I think guys...

1826
01:31:16,649 --> 01:31:17,741
like you...

1827
01:31:18,685 --> 01:31:21,415
are dumb fucking assholes.

1828
01:31:21,521 --> 01:31:22,890
That's what I think.

1829
01:31:22,990 --> 01:31:25,426
I bet you do, you sorry
son of a bitch.

1830
01:31:25,526 --> 01:31:27,461
'Cause you know
if they win,

1831
01:31:27,561 --> 01:31:28,763
if they win it,

1832
01:31:28,863 --> 01:31:30,765
you'll be the first
against the wall.

1833
01:31:30,865 --> 01:31:33,630
You know you can't trust
a fucking traitor.

1834
01:31:36,171 --> 01:31:37,572
Call me a fucking traitor?

1835
01:31:37,672 --> 01:31:39,574
If you weren't
in that chair...

1836
01:31:39,674 --> 01:31:41,877
I am in this chair!

1837
01:31:41,977 --> 01:31:44,479
Top of the ninth,
Charlie!

1838
01:31:44,579 --> 01:31:46,115
Shut the fuck up.

1839
01:31:46,215 --> 01:31:47,784
You shut the fuck up, man!

1840
01:31:47,884 --> 01:31:49,652
Come on, Phil,
forget it!

1841
01:31:49,752 --> 01:31:51,888
- Bullshit!
- He's a nutjob!

1842
01:31:51,988 --> 01:31:54,479
Come on, Ronnie,
he ain't fucking worth it.

1843
01:31:54,590 --> 01:31:55,992
Will you come on?

1844
01:31:56,092 --> 01:31:58,653
Hey, what's happening?
What's your name?

1845
01:31:58,762 --> 01:31:59,963
Jenny.

1846
01:32:00,063 --> 01:32:01,465
Penny?

1847
01:32:01,565 --> 01:32:02,554
Jenny.

1848
01:32:02,666 --> 01:32:04,463
How about going
to Mexico with me?

1849
01:32:04,601 --> 01:32:08,706
Mexico?
What do you mean, Mexico?

1850
01:32:08,806 --> 01:32:11,142
I mean, you're really beautiful.
That's what I mean.

1851
01:32:11,242 --> 01:32:12,277
Oh, yeah?

1852
01:32:12,377 --> 01:32:14,479
Oh, a really
beautiful place...

1853
01:32:14,579 --> 01:32:16,281
the ocean...

1854
01:32:16,381 --> 01:32:17,749
the sand, sun.

1855
01:32:17,849 --> 01:32:19,250
We could leave tonight.

1856
01:32:19,350 --> 01:32:22,254
We could take a plane.
Let's go tonight.

1857
01:32:22,354 --> 01:32:24,447
I think you're
really crazy.

1858
01:32:33,266 --> 01:32:34,733
Hey, hey, Billy!

1859
01:32:34,834 --> 01:32:35,769
Hey, Steve!

1860
01:32:35,869 --> 01:32:36,770
What's going on?

1861
01:32:36,870 --> 01:32:38,438
Same old same old.

1862
01:32:38,538 --> 01:32:42,075
# Well, I can remember
the 4th of July #

1863
01:32:42,175 --> 01:32:44,045
# Running through
the backwoods bay #

1864
01:32:44,145 --> 01:32:45,346
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

1865
01:32:45,446 --> 01:32:47,548
I bet you practiced
a lot.

1866
01:32:47,648 --> 01:32:49,851
I've got a lifetime
of practice, Jenny.

1867
01:32:49,951 --> 01:32:53,321
# The way that
he done to me #

1868
01:32:53,421 --> 01:32:55,515
# 'Cause
he'll get you now #

1869
01:32:57,326 --> 01:32:58,918
# Gonna getcha #

1870
01:32:59,928 --> 01:33:01,020
# Uhh #

1871
01:33:01,129 --> 01:33:02,960
# Well,
I can remember... ##

1872
01:33:03,065 --> 01:33:04,466
You O.K.?
You all right?

1873
01:33:04,566 --> 01:33:05,968
I don't mean
to laugh.

1874
01:33:06,068 --> 01:33:07,470
Shut up, Jenny.

1875
01:33:07,570 --> 01:33:09,806
Look at him.
He's fucking shitfaced!

1876
01:33:09,906 --> 01:33:10,840
Ronnie?

1877
01:33:10,940 --> 01:33:12,809
Ron?

1878
01:33:12,909 --> 01:33:14,433
Ronnie?

1879
01:33:15,845 --> 01:33:17,280
Give him some room.

1880
01:33:17,380 --> 01:33:18,748
Get him out of here.

1881
01:33:18,848 --> 01:33:20,251
Give me my chair.

1882
01:33:20,351 --> 01:33:21,752
Give me my chair.

1883
01:33:21,852 --> 01:33:23,754
I just want to dance.

1884
01:33:23,854 --> 01:33:25,756
I just want to dance.

1885
01:33:25,856 --> 01:33:27,925
Give me my chair.

1886
01:33:28,025 --> 01:33:29,593
Jenny!

1887
01:33:29,693 --> 01:33:30,854
Jenny!

1888
01:33:36,067 --> 01:33:38,627
I got it.
I got it.

1889
01:33:42,440 --> 01:33:43,776
Come on, come on.

1890
01:33:43,876 --> 01:33:46,470
Hey, Steve,
let's go. Come on.

1891
01:33:53,653 --> 01:33:55,556
Come on.
Steve, come on.

1892
01:33:55,656 --> 01:34:02,930
Let's go.

1893
01:34:03,030 --> 01:34:04,431
What's going on?

1894
01:34:04,531 --> 01:34:05,900
Are you drunk again?

1895
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:06,901
Hey, Mom.

1896
01:34:07,001 --> 01:34:08,436
He's drunk again.

1897
01:34:08,536 --> 01:34:10,405
Eli, we have
a drunk for a son.

1898
01:34:10,505 --> 01:34:11,940
You leave that alone.

1899
01:34:12,040 --> 01:34:13,908
You can't stay
in this house.

1900
01:34:14,008 --> 01:34:16,444
This is what
you believe in,

1901
01:34:16,544 --> 01:34:17,913
but I don't.

1902
01:34:18,013 --> 01:34:19,915
I don't believe
in him anymore.

1903
01:34:20,015 --> 01:34:21,917
I'll take care
of him.

1904
01:34:22,017 --> 01:34:24,920
I wish I were dead
like him.

1905
01:34:25,020 --> 01:34:26,922
You don't know
what you're saying.

1906
01:34:27,022 --> 01:34:28,489
That's the problem.
I'm not dead.

1907
01:34:28,590 --> 01:34:29,993
I got to live.

1908
01:34:30,093 --> 01:34:31,822
I got to roll around

1909
01:34:31,928 --> 01:34:34,055
and remind them
of Vietnam.

1910
01:34:34,164 --> 01:34:36,066
You don't want to see us.

1911
01:34:36,166 --> 01:34:37,601
You want to hide us

1912
01:34:37,701 --> 01:34:39,936
'cause it is
a can of shit!

1913
01:34:40,036 --> 01:34:41,472
And I am a fucking dummy!

1914
01:34:41,572 --> 01:34:43,474
He won't listen.
He won't change.

1915
01:34:43,574 --> 01:34:44,942
Take your mom seriously.

1916
01:34:45,042 --> 01:34:46,944
You can't drink
in this house.

1917
01:34:47,044 --> 01:34:48,980
I believed everything
they told us.

1918
01:34:49,080 --> 01:34:51,249
Go fight! Go kill!

1919
01:34:51,349 --> 01:34:52,783
Sergeant man,
Marine Corps!

1920
01:34:52,883 --> 01:34:54,620
Yo, squad!
Left, squad!

1921
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:56,054
Right, squad, left!

1922
01:34:56,154 --> 01:34:57,556
And it's all a lie.

1923
01:34:57,656 --> 01:35:01,393
The whole thing
is a bunch of lies!

1924
01:35:01,493 --> 01:35:03,358
Stop it! Go to bed!

1925
01:35:03,462 --> 01:35:06,733
What did they do to you
in that war?

1926
01:35:06,833 --> 01:35:08,668
You need help, Ronnie.

1927
01:35:08,768 --> 01:35:10,370
No, you need help,

1928
01:35:10,470 --> 01:35:11,871
with all your God

1929
01:35:11,971 --> 01:35:13,906
and your bullshit dreams
about me!

1930
01:35:14,006 --> 01:35:15,808
You are ashamed of me!

1931
01:35:15,908 --> 01:35:20,247
Go to sleep.
You go to bed.

1932
01:35:20,347 --> 01:35:21,915
Fuck you!

1933
01:35:22,015 --> 01:35:24,418
What did you say
to me?

1934
01:35:24,518 --> 01:35:26,086
What...

1935
01:35:26,186 --> 01:35:27,414
Mom!

1936
01:35:28,590 --> 01:35:29,658
Fuck you!

1937
01:35:29,758 --> 01:35:31,226
You'll wake
the whole neighborhood.

1938
01:35:31,326 --> 01:35:32,827
Wake them up!
Tell them!

1939
01:35:32,927 --> 01:35:37,227
Cusacks! Camelettis!
Walshes!

1940
01:35:37,332 --> 01:35:40,236
You tell them all
what they did to me,

1941
01:35:40,336 --> 01:35:43,272
what they did to this whole block,
this whole country.

1942
01:35:43,372 --> 01:35:44,839
They'll call the police.

1943
01:35:44,940 --> 01:35:46,809
We went to Vietnam
to stop communism.

1944
01:35:46,909 --> 01:35:49,045
We shot women
and children.

1945
01:35:49,145 --> 01:35:51,581
You didn't shoot
women and children.

1946
01:35:51,681 --> 01:35:53,050
The church
blessed the war.

1947
01:35:53,150 --> 01:35:54,551
Communism,
the insidious evil.

1948
01:35:54,651 --> 01:35:57,187
They...
They told us to go.

1949
01:35:57,287 --> 01:35:58,855
Yes, that's what
they told us.

1950
01:35:58,955 --> 01:36:00,757
Thou shall not kill, Mom.

1951
01:36:00,857 --> 01:36:03,761
Thou shall not kill
women and children.

1952
01:36:03,861 --> 01:36:05,763
Thou shall not kill,
remember?

1953
01:36:05,863 --> 01:36:08,331
Isn't that
what you taught us?

1954
01:36:08,433 --> 01:36:09,331
Stop it.

1955
01:36:09,434 --> 01:36:11,061
Stop it!

1956
01:36:11,169 --> 01:36:12,070
Stop it!

1957
01:36:12,170 --> 01:36:14,572
I don't want you
in this house.

1958
01:36:14,672 --> 01:36:16,041
You're out
of this house.

1959
01:36:16,141 --> 01:36:18,043
Ron, you made your point.

1960
01:36:18,143 --> 01:36:20,579
No! I haven't
made my point.

1961
01:36:20,679 --> 01:36:22,047
You tell her, Dad.

1962
01:36:22,147 --> 01:36:23,816
They're killing
everyone now!

1963
01:36:23,916 --> 01:36:25,351
I didn't force you
to go!

1964
01:36:25,451 --> 01:36:26,886
Yes, you did!

1965
01:36:26,986 --> 01:36:28,855
And it's all
falling apart!

1966
01:36:28,955 --> 01:36:31,725
King, Kennedy,
Kent State!

1967
01:36:31,825 --> 01:36:33,760
We all lost
the fucking war!

1968
01:36:33,860 --> 01:36:35,228
It's not my fault!

1969
01:36:35,328 --> 01:36:37,230
Communism won.
It's all for nothing.

1970
01:36:37,330 --> 01:36:38,566
That's not true,
Ronnie.

1971
01:36:38,666 --> 01:36:41,001
How do you know?
What do you know?

1972
01:36:41,101 --> 01:36:41,969
Ron.

1973
01:36:42,069 --> 01:36:45,527
Will you...
You tell her, Dad!

1974
01:36:45,639 --> 01:36:49,944
Tell her it's a lie!
It's a fucking lie!

1975
01:36:50,044 --> 01:36:51,446
There's no God!

1976
01:36:51,546 --> 01:36:53,448
God is as dead
as my legs!

1977
01:36:53,548 --> 01:36:55,951
There's no God!
There's no country!

1978
01:36:56,051 --> 01:36:56,952
It's nothing.

1979
01:36:57,052 --> 01:36:59,855
It's just me
and this fucking wheelchair

1980
01:36:59,955 --> 01:37:02,525
for the rest of my life
for nothing.

1981
01:37:02,625 --> 01:37:04,227
Me and this... this...

1982
01:37:04,327 --> 01:37:05,762
this dead penis, Mom.

1983
01:37:05,862 --> 01:37:07,463
Oh, God! Ronnie!

1984
01:37:07,563 --> 01:37:08,998
No, not with
the catheter.

1985
01:37:09,098 --> 01:37:10,466
- For God's sake...
- Penis!

1986
01:37:10,566 --> 01:37:13,503
Eli, I can't
stand it anymore.

1987
01:37:13,603 --> 01:37:15,005
To hell with you.

1988
01:37:15,105 --> 01:37:17,164
In church
they say it's a sin

1989
01:37:17,274 --> 01:37:18,571
if you play
with your penis.

1990
01:37:18,675 --> 01:37:20,233
I just wish I could.

1991
01:37:20,344 --> 01:37:23,080
Don't say penis
in this house!

1992
01:37:23,180 --> 01:37:24,047
Penis!

1993
01:37:24,147 --> 01:37:25,136
Stop!

1994
01:37:25,249 --> 01:37:26,484
Penis!

1995
01:37:26,584 --> 01:37:28,086
Big fucking erect penis, Mom!

1996
01:37:28,186 --> 01:37:30,321
- Stop!
- Penis! Penis!

1997
01:37:30,421 --> 01:37:32,824
He won't let go!
What can I do?

1998
01:37:32,924 --> 01:37:35,293
I never even got time
to learn how to use it.

1999
01:37:35,393 --> 01:37:38,330
It's gone in some
jungle in Asia.

2000
01:37:38,430 --> 01:37:40,762
Just gone for...

2001
01:37:45,771 --> 01:37:49,173
I'm sorry
it happened this way.

2002
01:37:50,977 --> 01:37:53,241
I'm sorry you're sad, Mom.

2003
01:37:53,346 --> 01:37:57,112
I'm so sorry
you're sa-sad.

2004
01:38:15,304 --> 01:38:17,272
I'm so fucked up.

2005
01:38:17,372 --> 01:38:19,033
Fucked up.

2006
01:38:26,215 --> 01:38:27,546
Ronnie...

2007
01:38:29,285 --> 01:38:32,222
maybe a little trip
is all you need.

2008
01:38:32,322 --> 01:38:33,723
That place
down in Mexico

2009
01:38:33,823 --> 01:38:35,225
you were
talking about.

2010
01:38:35,325 --> 01:38:37,194
I don't want
to go to Mexico.

2011
01:38:37,294 --> 01:38:40,197
I don't want
to go no place.

2012
01:38:40,297 --> 01:38:43,391
I don't want
to go no place.

2013
01:38:46,303 --> 01:38:47,395
Ronnie...

2014
01:38:49,007 --> 01:38:51,373
I think
you should go.

2015
01:38:53,645 --> 01:38:55,579
What can I do,
Ronnie?

2016
01:38:55,680 --> 01:38:57,238
What do you want?

2017
01:39:00,152 --> 01:39:03,178
I want to be
a man again.

2018
01:39:05,625 --> 01:39:07,960
Who's going
to love me, Dad?

2019
01:39:08,060 --> 01:39:10,654
Who's ever
going to love me?

2020
01:39:14,167 --> 01:39:17,034
Who's going to love me?

2021
01:39:59,984 --> 01:40:02,386
Hey, you maggots,
ante up 5 American.

2022
01:40:02,486 --> 01:40:03,885
Let's go. Ante up.

2023
01:40:03,988 --> 01:40:05,615
Ed, you're light.

2024
01:40:05,723 --> 01:40:07,714
The game
is seven-card stud,

2025
01:40:07,825 --> 01:40:09,226
one up, two down.

2026
01:40:09,326 --> 01:40:12,296
One up, two down.
We got a 5, a jack.

2027
01:40:12,397 --> 01:40:14,333
That's a fucking joker, a king.

2028
01:40:14,433 --> 01:40:17,903
The price of poker
just went up, gentlemen.

2029
01:40:18,003 --> 01:40:19,104
Charlie buys a queen.

2030
01:40:19,204 --> 01:40:21,239
Charlie, puppy.

2031
01:40:21,339 --> 01:40:22,807
Two down, two down.

2032
01:40:26,045 --> 01:40:28,514
Hey, big blue eyes,
what's your name?

2033
01:40:28,614 --> 01:40:29,549
What's that?

2034
01:40:29,649 --> 01:40:31,017
What's your name?

2035
01:40:31,117 --> 01:40:32,018
Ron Kovic.

2036
01:40:32,118 --> 01:40:33,754
Just what we need.
Another limp dick.

2037
01:40:33,854 --> 01:40:34,788
Where from?

2038
01:40:34,888 --> 01:40:36,753
Massapequa,
Long Island.

2039
01:40:36,857 --> 01:40:38,759
Guys, say hello
to Ron Kovic.

2040
01:40:38,859 --> 01:40:40,260
Just in from the States.

2041
01:40:40,360 --> 01:40:41,884
Hi, Ron.

2042
01:40:41,995 --> 01:40:43,897
Laugh, motherfucker.
You'll get yours.

2043
01:40:43,997 --> 01:40:46,601
Fuck you.

2044
01:40:46,701 --> 01:40:49,104
Put your hand
right there, baby.

2045
01:40:49,204 --> 01:40:51,172
What's your name?

2046
01:40:51,272 --> 01:40:53,241
Charlie,
from Chicago.

2047
01:40:53,341 --> 01:40:55,944
How long has this game
been going on?

2048
01:40:56,044 --> 01:40:57,313
55 hours.

2049
01:40:57,413 --> 01:40:59,348
How long
have you been here?

2050
01:40:59,448 --> 01:41:00,783
A hundred fucking years.

2051
01:41:00,883 --> 01:41:03,285
'Cause I got a gun.

2052
01:41:03,385 --> 01:41:06,088
I ain't ever going back.
Fuck the States.

2053
01:41:06,188 --> 01:41:07,790
Nobody understood.

2054
01:41:07,890 --> 01:41:09,882
Nobody gave a shit.

2055
01:41:09,993 --> 01:41:11,290
The fucking women

2056
01:41:11,394 --> 01:41:13,419
didn't even want
to look at me.

2057
01:41:13,530 --> 01:41:14,398
Fucking States.

2058
01:41:14,498 --> 01:41:17,267
I ain't never
going back.

2059
01:41:17,367 --> 01:41:19,130
I want something simple.

2060
01:41:20,103 --> 01:41:22,073
Oh, baby,
you're so beautiful.

2061
01:41:22,173 --> 01:41:23,508
Ain't she beautiful?

2062
01:41:23,608 --> 01:41:24,542
Here we go.

2063
01:41:24,642 --> 01:41:26,911
She's beautiful.

2064
01:41:27,011 --> 01:41:28,913
Go into town.
Get yourself one.

2065
01:41:29,013 --> 01:41:32,484
Fuck the shit out of you,
even if you are paralyzed.

2066
01:41:32,584 --> 01:41:34,386
Ain't that right, Martha?

2067
01:41:34,486 --> 01:41:37,156
You know what they say:
If you ain't got it in the hips,

2068
01:41:37,256 --> 01:41:40,793
you better have it in the lips.

2069
01:41:40,893 --> 01:41:43,657
Don't stay here,
man.

2070
01:41:43,762 --> 01:41:45,321
Get the fuck out.

2071
01:41:46,699 --> 01:41:50,658
You know, you're really drunk
on this Mescal shit...

2072
01:41:52,138 --> 01:41:54,007
when you swallow
the worm

2073
01:41:54,107 --> 01:41:57,044
and don't even know
you did it.

2074
01:41:57,144 --> 01:41:59,977
Last round of betting.
Let's go, maggots.

2075
01:43:10,824 --> 01:43:12,758
Are you from
Villa Rosa?

2076
01:43:12,859 --> 01:43:14,761
Yeah, yeah.

2077
01:43:14,861 --> 01:43:15,850
Yeah.

2078
01:43:15,962 --> 01:43:17,190
Bueno.

2079
01:43:17,297 --> 01:43:19,033
We go?

2080
01:43:19,133 --> 01:43:20,157
What's that?

2081
01:43:21,002 --> 01:43:23,271
Do you want
to go upstairs?

2082
01:43:23,371 --> 01:43:26,474
No. No, I'm just
looking around.

2083
01:43:26,574 --> 01:43:28,643
I just came in... Yeah!

2084
01:43:28,743 --> 01:43:30,579
I'd like to go upstairs.

2085
01:43:30,679 --> 01:43:32,237
I'd like to.

2086
01:43:33,615 --> 01:43:35,549
Good.
Then come.

2087
01:43:36,652 --> 01:43:38,142
Let's do it.

2088
01:43:45,929 --> 01:43:47,397
What's your name?

2089
01:43:47,497 --> 01:43:48,398
Maria Elena.

2090
01:43:48,498 --> 01:43:49,365
Maria Elena?

2091
01:43:49,465 --> 01:43:51,023
Hmm, si.

2092
01:44:00,344 --> 01:44:01,712
The money...

2093
01:44:01,812 --> 01:44:05,249
Sorry, I don't know how much...

2094
01:44:07,819 --> 01:44:09,912
This... This is good.

2095
01:44:11,823 --> 01:44:13,959
Why don't you
take them off?

2096
01:44:14,059 --> 01:44:15,227
No, I can't.

2097
01:44:15,327 --> 01:44:16,729
I can't
feel anything.

2098
01:44:16,829 --> 01:44:19,662
I was paralyzed
in the war.

2099
01:44:19,765 --> 01:44:21,255
Vietnam?

2100
01:44:21,367 --> 01:44:24,097
Yes.

2101
01:44:24,203 --> 01:44:26,105
You let me see?

2102
01:44:26,205 --> 01:44:27,263
No.

2103
01:44:27,373 --> 01:44:28,140
Doesn't move.

2104
01:44:28,240 --> 01:44:29,142
I can't.

2105
01:44:29,242 --> 01:44:30,110
Oh, yes.

2106
01:44:30,210 --> 01:44:31,144
It's no good.

2107
01:44:31,244 --> 01:44:32,613
Yes, let me see.

2108
01:44:32,713 --> 01:44:34,681
No. Look, please...

2109
01:44:34,781 --> 01:44:36,583
the spine was severed.

2110
01:44:36,683 --> 01:44:39,086
I have no movement,
no feeling.

2111
01:44:39,186 --> 01:44:41,122
There's nothing
down here at all.

2112
01:44:41,222 --> 01:44:42,123
Nothing happens.

2113
01:44:42,223 --> 01:44:43,224
O.K.

2114
01:44:43,324 --> 01:44:44,459
O.K.

2115
01:44:44,559 --> 01:44:45,793
O.K.

2116
01:44:45,893 --> 01:44:49,294
We're going to have
a good time.

2117
01:44:53,068 --> 01:44:55,127
It's going to be O.K.

2118
01:45:20,865 --> 01:45:23,629
- You like?
- Yes.

2119
01:46:32,642 --> 01:46:35,736
Hey, man, Kovic.
How was it?

2120
01:46:35,846 --> 01:46:37,074
How was it?

2121
01:46:37,180 --> 01:46:40,617
# Ai yi yi yi ##

2122
01:46:40,718 --> 01:46:42,620
Did you get one?
Did you get two?

2123
01:46:42,720 --> 01:46:44,255
Look out!

2124
01:46:44,355 --> 01:46:45,788
Banzai, motherfucker!

2125
01:46:53,365 --> 01:46:55,458
She loves you,
right, tiger?

2126
01:46:56,702 --> 01:46:59,271
Thanks a lot.
It was great.

2127
01:46:59,371 --> 01:47:02,275
Just remember,
keep one hand on her tits

2128
01:47:02,375 --> 01:47:03,967
and the other hand
on your wallet.

2129
01:47:09,182 --> 01:47:11,173
Paradise!
Right, man?

2130
01:47:14,755 --> 01:47:15,847
Whoo!

2131
01:47:52,162 --> 01:47:53,754
Can I see this?

2132
01:48:08,012 --> 01:48:10,949
I'll rip your fucking eye out
and skull-fuck you, motherfucker.

2133
01:48:11,049 --> 01:48:13,746
You ever been skull-fucked?
You ever been skull-fucked?

2134
01:48:13,852 --> 01:48:17,413
Yeah, I'll do it, man.
I'll do it, motherfucker.

2135
01:48:17,523 --> 01:48:19,821
It don't mean a fucking thing.

2136
01:48:21,927 --> 01:48:23,296
I'll be here tomorrow.

2137
01:48:23,396 --> 01:48:26,833
You couldn't keep me away
with a baseball bat.

2138
01:48:26,933 --> 01:48:28,867
I'll be here for sure.

2139
01:48:31,771 --> 01:48:32,829
Vietnam.

2140
01:48:48,557 --> 01:48:50,184
So...

2141
01:48:50,292 --> 01:48:52,227
we get married
today, no?

2142
01:48:52,327 --> 01:48:55,230
Oh, yeah, yeah.
That would be great.

2143
01:48:55,330 --> 01:48:56,524
Yeah.

2144
01:49:14,018 --> 01:49:15,417
Hi.

2145
01:49:17,321 --> 01:49:20,552
Want to fuck me? Huh?

2146
01:49:22,193 --> 01:49:24,388
I'll give you
a blow job.

2147
01:49:31,202 --> 01:49:34,073
Hey, mister,
you want me?

2148
01:49:34,173 --> 01:49:36,004
60 pesos.

2149
01:49:40,179 --> 01:49:41,441
Let's go.

2150
01:50:08,576 --> 01:50:11,068
Aah!

2151
01:50:49,488 --> 01:50:51,752
"Dear Mr.
And Mrs. Wilson...

2152
01:50:53,158 --> 01:50:57,096
"I don't... I don't know
how to tell you this.

2153
01:50:57,196 --> 01:51:00,256
"I knew your son
in Vietnam.

2154
01:51:03,236 --> 01:51:04,863
He was, uh..."

2155
01:51:07,640 --> 01:51:10,044
I'm going to kill that fucking guy.

2156
01:51:10,144 --> 01:51:13,047
I got him once.
I'll kill him now.

2157
01:51:13,147 --> 01:51:14,581
You'll see.

2158
01:51:14,681 --> 01:51:16,808
I'm serious.

2159
01:51:20,588 --> 01:51:22,757
Your body.

2160
01:51:22,857 --> 01:51:25,593
I'm just going
to fucking kill him.

2161
01:51:25,693 --> 01:51:27,395
Imas!

2162
01:51:27,495 --> 01:51:29,793
I'll fucking kill you!

2163
01:51:29,898 --> 01:51:31,300
I'll kill you,
bitch!

2164
01:51:31,400 --> 01:51:34,494
You can't talk to me
like that!

2165
01:51:34,603 --> 01:51:36,571
Hey! Charlie!

2166
01:51:36,672 --> 01:51:38,941
Get out! Get out!

2167
01:51:39,041 --> 01:51:42,812
The bitch thinks it's funny
I can't move my dick!

2168
01:51:42,912 --> 01:51:44,381
Fuck her.

2169
01:51:44,481 --> 01:51:46,972
I'll kill you, bitch!

2170
01:51:49,085 --> 01:51:51,855
Fuck all you
Mexican motherfuckers!

2171
01:51:51,955 --> 01:51:53,357
Imaricon!

2172
01:51:53,457 --> 01:51:55,126
You don't like it,
get out!

2173
01:51:55,226 --> 01:51:57,028
Fuck you!

2174
01:51:57,128 --> 01:51:59,697
Hey!
Don't touch my friend.

2175
01:51:59,797 --> 01:52:01,731
Don't you touch me!

2176
01:52:01,833 --> 01:52:03,267
Get the hell out!

2177
01:52:03,367 --> 01:52:05,494
Don't come back no more.

2178
01:52:05,603 --> 01:52:08,540
I wouldn't be here if
it weren't for that fucking war!

2179
01:52:08,640 --> 01:52:11,577
Fuck you!
Fuck all of you!

2180
01:52:11,677 --> 01:52:14,880
You sure you told him
the right place, man?

2181
01:52:14,980 --> 01:52:17,449
I told him fucking Villa Rosa!

2182
01:52:17,549 --> 01:52:18,451
Villa Rosa?

2183
01:52:18,551 --> 01:52:19,452
Villa Rosa!

2184
01:52:19,552 --> 01:52:20,954
Villa Rosa, señor,
Villa Rosa.

2185
01:52:21,054 --> 01:52:21,921
Beautiful place.

2186
01:52:22,021 --> 01:52:24,657
Great whorehouse there,
man.

2187
01:52:24,757 --> 01:52:25,859
Wait until we get there.

2188
01:52:25,959 --> 01:52:28,695
Beautiful women with big tits,
small tits...

2189
01:52:28,795 --> 01:52:32,900
That goddamned slut.
That Mexican scumbag cunt.

2190
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:34,468
I think I saw a sign,
Villa Rosa, Charlie,

2191
01:52:34,568 --> 01:52:36,365
10 minutes ago.

2192
01:52:36,470 --> 01:52:38,773
How far you going,
taco head?

2193
01:52:38,873 --> 01:52:40,141
¿Que pasa?

2194
01:52:40,241 --> 01:52:42,836
Wasn't that turn back there...
that sign that said "Villa Rosa"?

2195
01:52:42,944 --> 01:52:44,846
Look at the meter!
It's rigged!

2196
01:52:44,946 --> 01:52:46,581
He's rigged the fucking meter!

2197
01:52:46,681 --> 01:52:47,682
Hey, asshole!

2198
01:52:47,782 --> 01:52:50,273
Hey, I told you
fucking Villa Rosa!

2199
01:53:05,836 --> 01:53:08,771
What are we
going to do now?

2200
01:53:08,872 --> 01:53:09,930
Fuck them.

2201
01:53:11,041 --> 01:53:14,602
Yeah, sure.
How we going to get out of here?

2202
01:53:14,711 --> 01:53:16,513
Fuck them all.

2203
01:53:16,613 --> 01:53:18,016
Fuck the whores.

2204
01:53:18,116 --> 01:53:19,517
Fuck the cab drivers.

2205
01:53:19,617 --> 01:53:21,186
Fuck Mexico.

2206
01:53:21,286 --> 01:53:25,323
Fuck Nixon, fuck Vietnam,
fuck them all.

2207
01:53:25,423 --> 01:53:27,425
But how we going
to get out of here?

2208
01:53:27,525 --> 01:53:29,595
They made me
kill babies, man.

2209
01:53:29,695 --> 01:53:30,930
Little gook babies.

2210
01:53:31,030 --> 01:53:32,965
You ever have
to kill a baby?

2211
01:53:33,065 --> 01:53:35,468
Yeah. O.K., come on.
We'll get a ride.

2212
01:53:35,568 --> 01:53:37,336
We got to get back
to the villa.

2213
01:53:37,436 --> 01:53:40,272
Fuck you!
What do you mean, O.K.?

2214
01:53:40,372 --> 01:53:42,307
What do you mean, O.K.?

2215
01:53:42,409 --> 01:53:46,038
You ever have to kill
a little gook baby?

2216
01:53:46,179 --> 01:53:48,882
What the fuck do you know
what I did?

2217
01:53:48,982 --> 01:53:50,884
I didn't think so.
I didn't think so.

2218
01:53:50,984 --> 01:53:52,553
You're full of shit.

2219
01:53:52,653 --> 01:53:54,021
No, you are.

2220
01:53:54,121 --> 01:53:56,057
Leave me
the fuck alone!

2221
01:53:56,157 --> 01:53:57,191
You're nuts.

2222
01:53:57,291 --> 01:53:59,026
The sun
is going down.

2223
01:53:59,126 --> 01:54:01,329
We got to get
out of here.

2224
01:54:01,429 --> 01:54:03,866
Don't shit me, Kovic.
You never killed a baby.

2225
01:54:03,966 --> 01:54:05,367
You never had to.

2226
01:54:05,467 --> 01:54:08,303
You never put your soul
into that war,

2227
01:54:08,403 --> 01:54:10,305
never put your soul
on the line.

2228
01:54:10,405 --> 01:54:12,274
How the fuck
do you know?

2229
01:54:12,374 --> 01:54:15,310
Maybe I killed more babies
than you did, you fuck!

2230
01:54:15,410 --> 01:54:16,673
Maybe I did,

2231
01:54:16,779 --> 01:54:19,907
but I don't have
to talk about it!

2232
01:54:20,016 --> 01:54:22,452
Why not?
Why the fuck not?

2233
01:54:22,552 --> 01:54:23,920
What are you hiding?

2234
01:54:24,020 --> 01:54:26,756
What are you,
better than anybody else?

2235
01:54:26,856 --> 01:54:28,259
You a hero, maybe?

2236
01:54:28,359 --> 01:54:30,227
Got a bunch of fucking medals,

2237
01:54:30,327 --> 01:54:32,596
but deep down
you're full of shit!

2238
01:54:32,696 --> 01:54:35,392
You never fought.
You weren't even there.

2239
01:54:39,404 --> 01:54:41,940
What the fuck do you mean,
I wasn't there, man?

2240
01:54:42,040 --> 01:54:43,942
Come on, hero,
come clean.

2241
01:54:44,042 --> 01:54:45,477
Why should I?

2242
01:54:45,577 --> 01:54:46,945
What are you hiding?

2243
01:54:47,045 --> 01:54:49,377
You're the one that's hiding
here in Mexico.

2244
01:54:49,481 --> 01:54:52,246
What are you hiding from,
you whiny fuck?

2245
01:54:52,351 --> 01:54:53,753
Don't shit me!

2246
01:54:53,853 --> 01:54:56,789
You never killed anybody, anything,
did you, Kovic?

2247
01:54:56,889 --> 01:54:57,823
Did you?

2248
01:54:57,923 --> 01:55:00,192
Ever look at yourself
in the fucking mirror?

2249
01:55:00,292 --> 01:55:01,160
- Fuck you.
- You.

2250
01:55:01,260 --> 01:55:03,330
No... you!

2251
01:55:03,430 --> 01:55:04,197
Fuck you!

2252
01:55:04,297 --> 01:55:06,094
No, fuck you!

2253
01:55:20,682 --> 01:55:22,274
Get off me!

2254
01:55:38,435 --> 01:55:41,495
Hola, señores.
¿Que pasa aqui?

2255
01:55:44,340 --> 01:55:45,909
We need a ride.

2256
01:55:46,009 --> 01:55:47,344
O.K.!

2257
01:55:47,444 --> 01:55:48,843
Vamanos!

2258
01:55:52,783 --> 01:55:54,185
You O.K., man?

2259
01:55:54,285 --> 01:55:56,515
Fuck you.
You're full of shit.

2260
01:55:56,620 --> 01:55:59,557
You don't get it.
You don't get it.

2261
01:55:59,657 --> 01:56:02,394
You had a town once,
Charlie,

2262
01:56:02,494 --> 01:56:04,363
and a mother and father.

2263
01:56:04,463 --> 01:56:06,698
Things that made sense.

2264
01:56:06,798 --> 01:56:09,735
Do you remember
things that made sense,

2265
01:56:09,835 --> 01:56:11,703
things you could count on,

2266
01:56:11,803 --> 01:56:15,240
before we all
got so lost?

2267
01:56:21,647 --> 01:56:24,550
What are we going
to do, Charlie?

2268
01:56:24,650 --> 01:56:27,245
What am I going
to do, man?

2269
01:56:34,061 --> 01:56:36,291
What am I going to do?

2270
01:58:13,836 --> 01:58:15,238
Where you from, Wilson?

2271
01:58:15,338 --> 01:58:16,239
Venus, Georgia.

2272
01:58:16,339 --> 01:58:18,741
Georgia?
This is my second tour,

2273
01:58:18,841 --> 01:58:22,746
and I haven't seen
a Georgia boy get it yet.

2274
01:58:22,846 --> 01:58:23,938
Yeah?

2275
01:58:27,885 --> 01:58:29,820
Yeah,
I know about Wilson.

2276
01:58:29,920 --> 01:58:32,790
Sir, I think I might
have killed him, sir.

2277
01:58:32,890 --> 01:58:34,626
I think
I killed him.

2278
01:58:34,726 --> 01:58:36,318
I don't think so.

2279
01:59:22,377 --> 01:59:25,314
You don't have to worry
about them dogs.

2280
01:59:25,414 --> 01:59:26,904
They won't bite.

2281
01:59:29,484 --> 01:59:30,919
Y'all get away now.

2282
01:59:31,019 --> 01:59:32,418
Get on away!

2283
01:59:32,521 --> 01:59:34,924
It's all right.
It's all right.

2284
01:59:35,024 --> 01:59:37,927
They're probably just
afraid of that chair.

2285
01:59:38,027 --> 01:59:40,263
Mr. Wilson,
I'm Ron.

2286
01:59:40,363 --> 01:59:42,765
Thanks for, uh,
for seeing me.

2287
01:59:42,865 --> 01:59:46,270
Any friend of Billy's
is a friend of ours.

2288
01:59:46,370 --> 01:59:50,407
Well, uh, why don't you
come on in the house?

2289
01:59:50,507 --> 01:59:54,102
My wife fixed some chicken,
if'n you want some.

2290
01:59:56,881 --> 01:59:59,751
Yes, sir, it was
a real nice funeral.

2291
01:59:59,851 --> 02:00:03,555
Marine Honor Guard came
all the way down from Atlanta

2292
02:00:03,655 --> 02:00:05,088
in their fancy uniforms.

2293
02:00:05,190 --> 02:00:08,217
Fired their rifles
up in the sky.

2294
02:00:08,327 --> 02:00:09,228
Thank you.

2295
02:00:09,328 --> 02:00:10,630
The drums was beating.

2296
02:00:10,730 --> 02:00:13,099
'Course it was nothing
like the big war

2297
02:00:13,199 --> 02:00:15,895
100 years ago
down here.

2298
02:00:17,269 --> 02:00:23,176
But there was Billy
and Bruce... Bruce Crabtree...

2299
02:00:23,276 --> 02:00:24,811
Andy Henderson.

2300
02:00:24,911 --> 02:00:27,648
And the Rutledge boy,
Lance.

2301
02:00:27,748 --> 02:00:30,284
Yeah, Lance.
He was a nice boy.

2302
02:00:30,384 --> 02:00:31,786
For the life of me,

2303
02:00:31,886 --> 02:00:34,289
I still can't quite
figure that war out.

2304
02:00:34,389 --> 02:00:37,692
Why we had to go
all that dang way to fight it

2305
02:00:37,792 --> 02:00:41,729
and why's we had to lose
so many young men.

2306
02:00:41,829 --> 02:00:43,798
Can't figure it out.

2307
02:00:45,134 --> 02:00:49,004
But we got a proud tradition
here in this town.

2308
02:00:49,104 --> 02:00:52,808
Billy's great-grandfather
was at the First Bull Run.

2309
02:00:52,908 --> 02:00:56,079
My pa was
over in France in '18.

2310
02:00:56,179 --> 02:01:00,116
Don't forget, you were
over in the Pacific in '44.

2311
02:01:00,216 --> 02:01:01,184
Guadalcanal.

2312
02:01:01,284 --> 02:01:02,552
Is that right?

2313
02:01:02,652 --> 02:01:05,588
Yeah. Well, I guess
this family's fought

2314
02:01:05,688 --> 02:01:09,093
in every war that, uh,
this country's ever had.

2315
02:01:09,193 --> 02:01:12,128
I reckon we're ready
to do it again

2316
02:01:12,229 --> 02:01:13,856
if'n we have to.

2317
02:01:16,400 --> 02:01:21,106
'Course they never did know
what done happened and all.

2318
02:01:21,206 --> 02:01:25,010
There was a letter
from a colonel,

2319
02:01:25,110 --> 02:01:26,611
I think it was.

2320
02:01:26,711 --> 02:01:27,846
Colonel Moore.

2321
02:01:27,946 --> 02:01:30,350
That's right,
Colonel Moore.

2322
02:01:30,450 --> 02:01:33,386
He said there was
a bad ambush one night.

2323
02:01:33,486 --> 02:01:37,523
Said that Billy distinguished himself
in the fighting.

2324
02:01:37,623 --> 02:01:40,994
He also told us that
Billy died real quick.

2325
02:01:41,094 --> 02:01:44,087
That's good
that he died quick.

2326
02:01:58,746 --> 02:02:00,648
I was
his squad leader.

2327
02:02:00,748 --> 02:02:03,151
I didn't know Billy
real well.

2328
02:02:03,251 --> 02:02:05,654
He was new,
kind of quiet.

2329
02:02:05,754 --> 02:02:09,658
We didn't talk much
to new guys.

2330
02:02:09,758 --> 02:02:12,128
He was 19,
is that right?

2331
02:02:12,228 --> 02:02:13,796
That's right, 19.

2332
02:02:13,896 --> 02:02:14,897
Only son?

2333
02:02:14,997 --> 02:02:17,334
Yes, sir.
My only boy.

2334
02:02:17,434 --> 02:02:20,404
I think he said
he was married

2335
02:02:20,504 --> 02:02:21,971
and you were pregnant?

2336
02:02:24,574 --> 02:02:27,377
I remember
the day he was killed.

2337
02:02:27,477 --> 02:02:31,416
Uh... it was
a strange day.

2338
02:02:31,516 --> 02:02:35,686
We were out on patrol
near a beach area...

2339
02:02:35,786 --> 02:02:38,890
and, oh,
it was very confusing.

2340
02:02:38,990 --> 02:02:41,627
There was screaming
and firing.

2341
02:02:41,727 --> 02:02:42,989
Uh...

2342
02:02:44,963 --> 02:02:46,398
It was getting late,

2343
02:02:46,498 --> 02:02:52,369
and there were these
children, uh...

2344
02:02:52,472 --> 02:02:55,669
these babies...

2345
02:02:55,775 --> 02:02:58,335
that we killed
by mistake.

2346
02:03:00,113 --> 02:03:01,444
How awful.

2347
02:03:03,149 --> 02:03:04,785
And then it...

2348
02:03:04,885 --> 02:03:07,877
got really crazy.

2349
02:03:09,757 --> 02:03:11,959
And we had to pull back

2350
02:03:12,059 --> 02:03:16,364
because the NVA
were coming up on us.

2351
02:03:16,464 --> 02:03:19,401
And we got scattered
in the dunes.

2352
02:03:19,501 --> 02:03:21,002
People were yelling
at anything,

2353
02:03:21,102 --> 02:03:23,505
firing at anything.

2354
02:03:23,605 --> 02:03:26,665
And that was when it...
it happened.

2355
02:03:27,810 --> 02:03:30,746
I was, uh, confused...

2356
02:03:30,846 --> 02:03:31,972
scared.

2357
02:03:39,155 --> 02:03:41,750
I raised my rifle
three times...

2358
02:03:45,829 --> 02:03:49,128
and... shots...

2359
02:03:53,104 --> 02:03:55,595
The body fell
in the dunes.

2360
02:03:58,076 --> 02:03:59,509
God, this is...

2361
02:03:59,611 --> 02:04:02,480
this is very difficult
for me to say.

2362
02:04:02,580 --> 02:04:04,884
We don't have
to hear this, Ron.

2363
02:04:04,984 --> 02:04:08,721
But I think I was the one
that killed your son.

2364
02:04:08,821 --> 02:04:12,018
I was the one.
I was the one.

2365
02:04:15,295 --> 02:04:16,887
I was the one.

2366
02:04:35,416 --> 02:04:37,907
What's done
is done, sir.

2367
02:04:38,019 --> 02:04:40,682
I can't ever
forgive you...

2368
02:04:41,757 --> 02:04:44,123
but maybe the Lord can.

2369
02:04:55,505 --> 02:04:58,099
We understand, Ron.

2370
02:05:01,344 --> 02:05:06,874
We understand the pain
you've been going through.

2371
02:06:24,301 --> 02:06:25,469
Peace now!

2372
02:06:25,569 --> 02:06:26,504
Peace now!

2373
02:06:26,604 --> 02:06:27,438
Peace now!

2374
02:06:27,538 --> 02:06:28,439
Peace now!

2375
02:06:28,539 --> 02:06:30,041
Peace now!

2376
02:06:30,141 --> 02:06:32,243
Bring our brothers
home now!

2377
02:06:32,343 --> 02:06:33,571
Bring our brothers
home now!

2378
02:06:33,677 --> 02:06:35,580
Bring our brothers
home now!

2379
02:06:35,680 --> 02:06:37,115
Bring our brothers
home now!

2380
02:06:37,215 --> 02:06:39,051
Bring our brothers
home now!

2381
02:06:39,151 --> 02:06:40,886
1, 2, 3, 4,

2382
02:06:40,986 --> 02:06:42,721
we don't want
your fucking war!

2383
02:06:42,821 --> 02:06:44,323
1, 2, 3, 4,

2384
02:06:44,423 --> 02:06:46,491
we don't want
your fucking war!

2385
02:06:46,591 --> 02:06:47,994
1, 2, 3, 4,

2386
02:06:48,094 --> 02:06:50,229
we don't want
your fucking war!

2387
02:06:50,329 --> 02:06:52,165
1, 2, 3, 4,

2388
02:06:52,265 --> 02:06:54,067
we don't want
your fucking war!

2389
02:06:54,167 --> 02:06:56,069
1, 2, 3, 4,

2390
02:06:56,169 --> 02:06:58,237
we don't want
your fucking war!

2391
02:06:58,337 --> 02:07:00,074
1, 2, 3, 4,

2392
02:07:00,174 --> 02:07:01,909
we don't want
your fucking war!

2393
02:07:02,009 --> 02:07:03,911
1, 2, 3, 4,

2394
02:07:04,011 --> 02:07:06,104
we don't want
your fucking war!

2395
02:07:06,213 --> 02:07:10,050
Bring our brothers
home now!

2396
02:07:10,150 --> 02:07:14,823
Drugs. Marijuana.
Traffic violations.

2397
02:07:14,923 --> 02:07:16,291
Separate the hippies.

2398
02:07:16,391 --> 02:07:20,128
Tonight, I again proudly
accept your nomination

2399
02:07:20,228 --> 02:07:22,823
for President
of the United States.

2400
02:07:25,067 --> 02:07:27,370
And let us place ourselves

2401
02:07:27,470 --> 02:07:29,472
to win an even
greater victory

2402
02:07:29,572 --> 02:07:31,199
this November in 1972.

2403
02:07:32,875 --> 02:07:34,344
Four more years!

2404
02:07:34,444 --> 02:07:35,746
Four more years!

2405
02:07:35,846 --> 02:07:37,381
Four more years!

2406
02:07:37,481 --> 02:07:38,880
Four more years!

2407
02:07:38,982 --> 02:07:40,279
Four more years!

2408
02:07:40,383 --> 02:07:42,078
Four more years!

2409
02:07:42,185 --> 02:07:43,954
Four more years!

2410
02:07:44,054 --> 02:07:45,521
Four more years!

2411
02:07:45,622 --> 02:07:46,647
Four more years!

2412
02:07:46,757 --> 02:07:48,782
Can I break through
your complacency?

2413
02:07:48,893 --> 02:07:50,294
Do you have compassion

2414
02:07:50,394 --> 02:07:52,897
for the people
suffering in this war?

2415
02:07:52,997 --> 02:07:56,067
I'm telling you
this war is a crime!

2416
02:07:56,167 --> 02:07:59,104
I'm not as bitter
about my wounds...

2417
02:07:59,204 --> 02:08:01,607
Who do you
think you are?

2418
02:08:01,707 --> 02:08:03,075
Can I help you, sir?

2419
02:08:03,175 --> 02:08:04,576
You can't come through.

2420
02:08:04,676 --> 02:08:06,111
You can't
come through, sir.

2421
02:08:06,211 --> 02:08:08,042
I have a pass.

2422
02:08:14,187 --> 02:08:15,654
Who are these people?

2423
02:08:15,755 --> 02:08:17,916
You can't stop us!

2424
02:08:18,024 --> 02:08:19,459
You can't stop me!

2425
02:08:19,559 --> 02:08:20,960
You can't stop me!

2426
02:08:21,060 --> 02:08:22,363
Why are you
here tonight?

2427
02:08:22,463 --> 02:08:24,532
What do you
have to say?

2428
02:08:24,632 --> 02:08:26,033
My name's Ron Kovic.

2429
02:08:26,133 --> 02:08:27,501
I'm a Vietnam veteran.

2430
02:08:27,601 --> 02:08:30,538
I'm here to say
this war is wrong,

2431
02:08:30,638 --> 02:08:34,109
that this society lied
to me and my brothers...

2432
02:08:34,209 --> 02:08:35,644
Why don't you
shut up?

2433
02:08:35,744 --> 02:08:38,380
It deceived the people
in this country.

2434
02:08:38,480 --> 02:08:41,950
It tricked them
into going 13,000 miles

2435
02:08:42,050 --> 02:08:46,385
to fight a war against
a poor peasant people

2436
02:08:46,489 --> 02:08:49,151
who have a proud history
of resistance,

2437
02:08:49,258 --> 02:08:53,029
who have been struggling
for their own independence

2438
02:08:53,129 --> 02:08:55,465
for 1,000 years...
the Vietnamese people.

2439
02:08:55,565 --> 02:08:59,436
I can't... I can't find
the words to express

2440
02:08:59,536 --> 02:09:02,439
how the leadership
of this government sickens me.

2441
02:09:02,539 --> 02:09:05,008
Now, people say...

2442
02:09:05,108 --> 02:09:08,346
people say if you
don't love America,

2443
02:09:08,446 --> 02:09:09,814
then get the hell out.

2444
02:09:09,914 --> 02:09:11,316
Well, I love America,

2445
02:09:11,416 --> 02:09:14,319
but when it comes
to the government,

2446
02:09:14,419 --> 02:09:15,954
it stops right there.

2447
02:09:16,054 --> 02:09:18,723
The government is
a bunch of corrupt thieves.

2448
02:09:18,823 --> 02:09:20,815
They are rapists
and robbers.

2449
02:09:20,926 --> 02:09:22,328
We are here to say

2450
02:09:22,428 --> 02:09:24,296
we don't
have to take it anymore.

2451
02:09:24,396 --> 02:09:27,066
We are here
to tell the truth.

2452
02:09:27,166 --> 02:09:29,335
They're killing
our brothers in Vietnam.

2453
02:09:29,435 --> 02:09:31,303
We want them
to hear the truth.

2454
02:09:31,403 --> 02:09:32,272
Traitor!

2455
02:09:32,372 --> 02:09:34,772
What are you,
a communist?

2456
02:09:37,010 --> 02:09:38,378
Is this what we get,

2457
02:09:38,478 --> 02:09:40,469
spit in the face?

2458
02:09:41,948 --> 02:09:43,317
Is this what we get?

2459
02:09:43,417 --> 02:09:46,687
Is this what we get, sir?
Spit in the face?

2460
02:09:46,787 --> 02:09:49,223
We're never going
to let the people

2461
02:09:49,323 --> 02:09:51,025
forget that war!

2462
02:09:51,125 --> 02:09:53,025
Four more years!

2463
02:09:53,127 --> 02:09:55,531
You're not sweeping it
under the rug

2464
02:09:55,631 --> 02:09:57,826
because you didn't
like the ratings.

2465
02:09:57,933 --> 02:09:58,867
This wheelchair,

2466
02:09:58,967 --> 02:09:59,835
our wheelchairs,

2467
02:09:59,935 --> 02:10:01,370
this steel, our steel

2468
02:10:01,470 --> 02:10:03,238
is your Memorial Day
on wheels.

2469
02:10:03,338 --> 02:10:05,774
We're your Yankee
Doodle Dandy come home.

2470
02:10:05,874 --> 02:10:07,477
We're your
Yankee Doodle Dandy.

2471
02:10:07,577 --> 02:10:09,045
Let's reject any philosophy

2472
02:10:09,145 --> 02:10:12,215
that would make us
a divided people of America.

2473
02:10:12,315 --> 02:10:13,249
Stop the bombing!

2474
02:10:13,349 --> 02:10:14,484
Stop the war!

2475
02:10:14,584 --> 02:10:15,518
Stop the bombing!

2476
02:10:15,618 --> 02:10:16,710
Stop the war!

2477
02:10:24,895 --> 02:10:26,863
Stop the bombing!
Stop the war!

2478
02:10:26,964 --> 02:10:28,365
Some sort of scuffle

2479
02:10:28,465 --> 02:10:31,026
has broken out
on the convention floor,

2480
02:10:31,136 --> 02:10:33,538
disabled veterans
protesting the Vietnam War.

2481
02:10:33,638 --> 02:10:35,407
We'll try to
get down there.

2482
02:10:35,507 --> 02:10:38,910
Why are they gassing us
in the parking lot?

2483
02:10:39,010 --> 02:10:40,412
Why are they fighting us?

2484
02:10:40,512 --> 02:10:41,947
Because it's a lie.

2485
02:10:42,047 --> 02:10:43,416
The truth is

2486
02:10:43,516 --> 02:10:45,585
they've killed a generation
of young men.

2487
02:10:45,685 --> 02:10:47,053
They have sacrificed

2488
02:10:47,153 --> 02:10:49,155
a whole generation
of young men.

2489
02:10:49,255 --> 02:10:50,847
Stop the bombing!

2490
02:10:51,757 --> 02:10:53,593
Stop the bombing!

2491
02:10:53,693 --> 02:10:55,028
Communists!

2492
02:10:55,128 --> 02:10:56,857
Communists!

2493
02:11:06,240 --> 02:11:07,141
Stop the bombing!

2494
02:11:07,241 --> 02:11:08,509
Stop the war!

2495
02:11:08,609 --> 02:11:10,445
Stop the bombing!
Stop the war!

2496
02:11:10,545 --> 02:11:12,740
Traitor!
Go home!

2497
02:11:27,329 --> 02:11:29,594
I say to you tonight...

2498
02:11:31,634 --> 02:11:33,036
in these times,

2499
02:11:33,136 --> 02:11:36,072
when there is so much
of a tendency

2500
02:11:36,172 --> 02:11:39,109
to run down those
who have served America

2501
02:11:39,209 --> 02:11:40,945
in the past and today,

2502
02:11:41,045 --> 02:11:44,448
let's give those
who have served in Vietnam

2503
02:11:44,548 --> 02:11:46,450
the honor and the respect

2504
02:11:46,550 --> 02:11:49,286
that they deserve
and that they've earned.

2505
02:11:49,386 --> 02:11:51,155
1, 2, 3, 4,

2506
02:11:51,255 --> 02:11:52,658
we don't want
your fucking war!

2507
02:11:52,758 --> 02:11:54,393
1, 2, 3, 4,

2508
02:11:54,493 --> 02:11:56,256
we don't want
your fucking war!

2509
02:11:59,164 --> 02:12:00,565
Get the car!

2510
02:12:00,665 --> 02:12:02,100
Get the car!

2511
02:12:02,200 --> 02:12:03,568
Shut the fuck up!

2512
02:12:03,668 --> 02:12:05,838
You're under arrest,
Kovic! Come on!

2513
02:12:05,938 --> 02:12:06,905
What?

2514
02:12:07,006 --> 02:12:08,064
Shut up!

2515
02:12:08,174 --> 02:12:09,542
You're a pig?

2516
02:12:09,642 --> 02:12:12,545
You should've died over there,
you traitor.

2517
02:12:12,645 --> 02:12:14,112
I don't have balance.

2518
02:12:14,213 --> 02:12:16,650
Give me
your hands!

2519
02:12:16,750 --> 02:12:18,479
O.K., I'll go
with you!

2520
02:12:23,924 --> 02:12:24,958
I'm not
under arrest.

2521
02:12:25,058 --> 02:12:26,326
I don't have to...

2522
02:12:26,426 --> 02:12:27,862
Hey, take it easy!

2523
02:12:27,962 --> 02:12:31,266
Get your hands
behind you!

2524
02:12:31,366 --> 02:12:33,168
I'm paralyzed!

2525
02:12:33,268 --> 02:12:36,137
Get those cameras
out of here!

2526
02:12:36,237 --> 02:12:37,138
Hey!

2527
02:12:37,238 --> 02:12:38,540
Hey!

2528
02:12:38,640 --> 02:12:40,268
I'm paralyzed!

2529
02:12:40,376 --> 02:12:42,503
Get in the fucking car!

2530
02:12:42,611 --> 02:12:43,635
Hey!

2531
02:12:43,746 --> 02:12:44,770
Hey!

2532
02:12:56,893 --> 02:12:57,794
My chair!

2533
02:12:57,894 --> 02:12:58,986
My ch...

2534
02:13:03,467 --> 02:13:04,525
Stop it!

2535
02:13:23,322 --> 02:13:24,990
Tactical line!

2536
02:13:25,090 --> 02:13:29,027
Advance and disperse
the crowd!

2537
02:13:30,063 --> 02:13:31,598
The whole world's
watching!

2538
02:13:31,698 --> 02:13:34,033
Let me go!

2539
02:13:34,133 --> 02:13:35,135
You O.K.?

2540
02:13:35,235 --> 02:13:36,636
Doc, is he O.K.?

2541
02:13:36,736 --> 02:13:37,637
I'm O.K.

2542
02:13:37,737 --> 02:13:39,140
How we doing here?

2543
02:13:39,240 --> 02:13:40,608
How many fingers
you got?

2544
02:13:40,708 --> 02:13:42,042
Your head is cut.

2545
02:13:42,142 --> 02:13:43,544
Anyplace else
hurting?

2546
02:13:43,644 --> 02:13:45,546
I'm O.K.
Where's my chair?

2547
02:13:45,646 --> 02:13:47,079
Where's my chair?

2548
02:13:47,181 --> 02:13:48,616
Bring his
chair over!

2549
02:13:48,716 --> 02:13:50,184
You're cut
over your eye.

2550
02:13:50,285 --> 02:13:52,412
The media's got
to see this.

2551
02:13:52,520 --> 02:13:54,189
We heard you
shouted down Nixon.

2552
02:13:54,289 --> 02:13:55,891
Eddie was arrested,

2553
02:13:55,991 --> 02:13:57,425
they beat Peterson,

2554
02:13:57,525 --> 02:13:58,894
O'Malley's
gassed real bad,

2555
02:13:58,994 --> 02:14:00,896
and Piscatelli's
got a concussion!

2556
02:14:00,996 --> 02:14:03,833
It's a fucking mess over there!

2557
02:14:03,933 --> 02:14:06,402
Frankie, bring the
media to the gate.

2558
02:14:06,502 --> 02:14:07,436
What?

2559
02:14:07,536 --> 02:14:08,938
The pigs are coming!

2560
02:14:09,038 --> 02:14:10,406
They're clearing the park!

2561
02:14:10,506 --> 02:14:12,441
They've arrested
like 30 people...

2562
02:14:12,541 --> 02:14:13,944
O.K., O.K., listen up!

2563
02:14:14,044 --> 02:14:15,913
Listen up.
Hey, hey, hey!

2564
02:14:16,013 --> 02:14:17,915
We're going
to take the hall back.

2565
02:14:18,015 --> 02:14:18,916
You hear?

2566
02:14:19,016 --> 02:14:20,483
We're going
to the gate,

2567
02:14:20,584 --> 02:14:22,953
we're gonna take
the motherfucking hall back.

2568
02:14:23,053 --> 02:14:24,918
Fall out! Let's move!

2569
02:14:34,198 --> 02:14:36,100
1, 2, 3, 4,

2570
02:14:36,200 --> 02:14:38,437
we don't want
your fucking war!

2571
02:14:38,537 --> 02:14:39,939
1, 2, 3, 4,

2572
02:14:40,039 --> 02:14:41,874
we don't want
your fucking war!

2573
02:14:41,974 --> 02:14:43,876
1, 2, 3, 4,

2574
02:14:43,976 --> 02:14:46,069
we don't want
your fucking war!

2575
02:15:09,103 --> 02:15:10,972
Let us reject the notion

2576
02:15:11,072 --> 02:15:12,975
of politics of the few,

2577
02:15:13,075 --> 02:15:15,544
by the few,
and for the few.

2578
02:15:15,644 --> 02:15:17,839
We dedicate ourselves
to the notion

2579
02:15:17,946 --> 02:15:20,141
this is a government
of the people,

2580
02:15:20,248 --> 02:15:22,618
by the people,
and for all the people,

2581
02:15:22,718 --> 02:15:27,357
black, brown, red,
yellow, white, women,

2582
02:15:27,457 --> 02:15:30,159
young, old,
workers, students.

2583
02:15:30,259 --> 02:15:32,762
This is our land
in this country.

2584
02:15:32,862 --> 02:15:35,833
Ransom, the feminist,
she's six minutes over.

2585
02:15:35,933 --> 02:15:37,801
I've got
the Jackson people

2586
02:15:37,901 --> 02:15:39,336
breathing down my neck.

2587
02:15:39,436 --> 02:15:40,304
Who follows?

2588
02:15:40,404 --> 02:15:41,805
It won't
be a problem.

2589
02:15:41,905 --> 02:15:42,806
You're next.

2590
02:15:42,906 --> 02:15:43,807
Mr. Kovic?

2591
02:15:43,907 --> 02:15:45,876
We're just about
ready for you.

2592
02:15:45,976 --> 02:15:47,445
Can I get you
anything?

2593
02:15:47,545 --> 02:15:48,780
Coke, iced tea?

2594
02:15:48,880 --> 02:15:50,248
Let's do it.

2595
02:15:50,348 --> 02:15:52,407
O.K., Ron.
It's your time.

2596
02:15:52,517 --> 02:15:55,042
It's been a long way
to get here.

2597
02:15:55,153 --> 02:15:57,088
Tell them what
it is, Ron!

2598
02:15:57,188 --> 02:15:58,556
Come on, Ronnie!

2599
02:15:58,656 --> 02:16:01,125
Go get them, man.
For Eddie, man.

2600
02:16:01,227 --> 02:16:02,595
Ronnie for president!

2601
02:16:02,695 --> 02:16:03,596
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

2602
02:16:03,696 --> 02:16:06,098
The whole world's
watching. I love you.

2603
02:16:06,198 --> 02:16:07,633
All right, Frankie!

2604
02:16:07,733 --> 02:16:09,101
I feel good.

2605
02:16:09,201 --> 02:16:10,603
Ronnie for president.

2606
02:16:10,703 --> 02:16:12,306
Whoo!

2607
02:16:12,406 --> 02:16:14,007
Congratulations.

2608
02:16:14,107 --> 02:16:17,411
I love what
you're doing.

2609
02:16:17,511 --> 02:16:20,347
Clear a path for me, please.
Stand back.

2610
02:16:20,447 --> 02:16:21,505
Thank you.

2611
02:16:22,817 --> 02:16:25,581
I had a dream, Ronnie.

2612
02:16:25,686 --> 02:16:28,314
You were speaking
to a large crowd,

2613
02:16:28,423 --> 02:16:31,551
and you were saying
great things.

2614
02:16:39,802 --> 02:16:41,303
Our next speaker

2615
02:16:41,403 --> 02:16:44,106
is one
of our Vietnam veterans

2616
02:16:44,206 --> 02:16:48,303
who has something very
special to say tonight.

2617
02:16:49,245 --> 02:16:50,507
Please!

2618
02:16:51,448 --> 02:16:52,849
Please be quiet!

2619
02:16:52,949 --> 02:16:54,818
Coming up top.

2620
02:16:54,918 --> 02:16:57,620
What will you
say tonight, Mr. Kovic?

2621
02:16:57,720 --> 02:16:59,586
I'm going
to tell the truth.

2622
02:16:59,690 --> 02:17:01,625
Any plans
for the future?

2623
02:17:01,725 --> 02:17:03,693
I guess we'll see.

2624
02:17:03,794 --> 02:17:06,697
Mr. Kovic, could you please
sign your book?

2625
02:17:06,797 --> 02:17:08,287
A young man

2626
02:17:08,399 --> 02:17:10,869
who comes from
Massapequa, Long Island...

2627
02:17:10,969 --> 02:17:12,904
All righty, coming through!

2628
02:17:13,004 --> 02:17:14,873
All right, sweetheart.
Straight on through.

2629
02:17:14,973 --> 02:17:16,808
Straight on through.

2630
02:17:16,908 --> 02:17:19,344
How does it feel
to address the entire country?

2631
02:17:19,444 --> 02:17:21,347
Uh, overwhelming...

2632
02:17:21,447 --> 02:17:22,382
an honor...

2633
02:17:22,482 --> 02:17:25,351
It's been a long way
for us...

2634
02:17:25,451 --> 02:17:26,886
the vets... uh...

2635
02:17:26,986 --> 02:17:31,946
Just lately I've felt
like I'm home.

2636
02:17:32,058 --> 02:17:32,956
You know?

2637
02:17:33,059 --> 02:17:36,052
Like, uh,
maybe we're home.

2638
02:17:37,498 --> 02:17:38,932
Welcome home,
Ronnie!

2639
02:17:39,032 --> 02:17:40,465
Go get them,
Ron!
