00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:10,354
Lil? Please. Come on.

679
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:12,477
One, two, three.

680
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:16,632
Have a look at the new menu.
A few items will seem familiar.

681
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,871
Most are new.

682
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:22,033
And most of our guests will be
a bit uncomfortable at first.

683
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:24,192
Do you know about the Michelin men?

684
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:28,110
- It is a book.
- It is the book, Yana. The Bible.

685
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:31,791
TONY: Michelin sends its inspectors
to restaurants to eat and award stars.

686
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:34,759
- One. Two. Three.
- Or none.

687
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:37,910
No one knows who they are. No one.

688
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:39,554
They come, they eat, they go.

689
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:42,440
But they have habits.
They have to stick to a routine

690
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:44,193
to give every restaurant
the same chance.

691
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:46,192
Michelin men eat in pairs.

692
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:48,511
KAITLIN: Sometimes the Michelin man
could even be a woman.

693
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:50,831
They always book a table before 7:30.

694
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,720
The first of the pair arrives early
and has a drink at the bar.

695
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:55,394
His partner arrives half an hour later.

696
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:58,718
One orders the tasting menu,
the other one a la carte. Always.

697
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,519
They order half a bottle of wine.

698
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:02,114
They ask for tap water.
They wear business suits.

699
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:04,192
They're polite. But attention.

700
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:05,754
They may place a fork on the floor,

701
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:08,560
under the table to see if you notice,
and they wouldn't drop it

702
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,040
because that could make
a noise and make it too easy.

703
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:12,197
ADAM: Everything from now on
must be perfect.

704
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:16,434
Not good, not excellent... perfect.

705
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:20,276
If they find one single thing wrong,
they will kill us.

706
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:22,432
And they will come for us soon.

00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:21,232
You're the ogre.

850
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:25,800
Yes. But I bake great cakes.

851
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:52,275
Good?

852
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:55,960
I've had better.

853
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:59,119
- Really?

857
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:13,034

(WATER STOPS)

859
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:30,916
- Adam?
- Yo.

860
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:33,117
The maids don't come?

861
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:35,636
I always leave the, uh,
"do not disturb" sign on.

862
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:38,952
We have a laundry service as well.

863
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:42,673
You have an invitation.

864
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:47,074
Montgomery Reece invites you
to the relaunch of his restaurant.

865
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:48,959
I thought he hated you.

866
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:52,238
He does. That's why he invited me.
Tell him yes.

867
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:54,636
Well, if you go, you should
take someone with you.

868
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:57,520
Someone to stop you from
getting into a fight with him.

869
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:00,036
(SNIFFS) Oh, you mean like you?

870
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:06,789
No.

871
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:08,917
Your therapist's got a big mouth.

872
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:14,800
Nothing you didn't know.

873
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:19,072
You said in your restaurant
everything was possible,

874
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:23,200
but, um, I know
not everything is possible.

875
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:28,790
Besides, you're not as pretty
as you once were.

876
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:33,072
Hey, Tony.

877
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:38,314
Uh, you hungry?

878
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:40,392
Can I... can I make you
breakfast or something?

879
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:45,951
You mean, cook me breakfast
instead of falling in love with me?

880
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,593
Yeah.

881
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:51,877
No. Thank you.

882
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:53,514
I already ate.

883
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:56,072
But I appreciate the thought.

884
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,514
Take someone nice.

885

(DOOR OPENS, CLOSES)

886
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:10,029
Little more skin on the bass, yeah?

887
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:11,600
- Yes, chef. Yeah.
- You got that, right?

888
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:14,036
Oh, you got to thin this sauce.
It's like fucking glue.

889
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:20,239
You have a nice dress?

890
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:22,636
- Excuse me?
- Do you have a nice dress?

891
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:24,678
I got to go to this party, and, uh...

892
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:28,557
you're the only girl that I know, so...

893
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:31,679
Uh, yeah. Sure.

894
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:35,594
Good.

895
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:49,717
Hey, pretend you're my girlfriend, okay?

896
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:52,156
If Reece knows who you are,
he'll steal you away.

897
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:54,596
If I was your girlfriend,
you'd probably hold my arm.

898
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:57,275
No, if you were my girlfriend, we would've
gotten in an argument in the taxi.

899
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:58,709
We wouldn't even be talking.

900
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:01,440
I've been working more
on the potato truffle veloute.

901
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:03,160
I think we should put it
on the menu tomorrow,

902
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:05,471
as a sort of modern take
on sole bonne femme.

903
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:08,235
Michelin loves it when
you celebrate French cuisine.

904
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:11,472
- You look great by the way.
- Thank you.

905
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:12,790

- Oh, hi, nice to meet you.

This is Marcus.

907

- Marcus.
- Nice to meet you, sir.

908
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:17,792
Marcus, is, uh, actually one of
the investors in the other restaurant.

909
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,356
REECE: Excellent.
Well, thank you very much.

910
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:24,960
Hello, Jones.
You find a nice flat surface yet?

911
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:28,759
I take it you are the saucier he's been
trying to hide from me this whole time,

912
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:31,310
in which case,
when you do get tired of him,

913
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:33,119
this is what you could be cooking.

914
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:34,760
You're doing me almost as good as me.

915
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:37,674
And you're using butter.
Where'd you come up with that idea?

916
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:39,274
WOMAN: Adam?

917
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:45,995
I didn't invite her.
She came with another guest.

918
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:54,550
Who is she?

919
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:56,837
That is Jean Luc's daughter, Anne Marie.

920
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:58,997
The Times just arrived.

921
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:04,000
What are you doing here?

922
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:06,595
I thought maybe you would
come to Papa's funeral.

923
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:08,792
Yeah, I didn't know that he'd died.

924
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:14,399
(EXHALES) I've missed you.

925
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:18,593
I'm better now.
Been clean almost two years.

926
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:22,915
(EXHALES) I went to a clinic in Milan.

927

01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:32,391
- What do you want?

930
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:39,196
Papa wanted you to have his knives.

931
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:45,238
Would you like me to send them?

932
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:47,309

(♪ RY X: "LOVE LIKE THIS")

936
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:17,279
Hi.

937
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:19,318
Have you been here all night?

938
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:20,800
How'd you find me?

939
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:23,998
Couldn't sleep, then I remembered
sole bonne femme needs sole.

940
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:27,270
Yeah, without skin.

by the way, not Scottish.

942
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:42,032
It's my ex-husband's name.

943
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:43,793
Leon Sweeney.

944
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:47,437
Didn't work out, huh?

945
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:49,512
It could have done.

946
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,351
We were really good
for a long time, but...

947
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:58,838
You know, we drank too much,
and partied too much and...

948
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:03,350
I could stay up for days,
and he loved that about me.

949
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:07,200
Then I got pregnant with Lily and,

950
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:09,873
you know, I wanted to stop,
and he didn't.

951
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:15,031
- Didn't or couldn't?
- What's the difference?

952
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:19,640
Yeah.

953
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:25,393
I worked in places like this
all the time when I was a kid.

954
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:31,109
I saved up a bunch of money,
bought a one-way ticket to Paris.

955
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:35,756
Lied my way into Jean Luc's kitchen.

956
01:06:38,360 --> 01:06:42,240
That's when Max was there, and Reece,
and, uh, Michel came later.

957
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:47,875
I didn't speak any French.

958
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:51,559
Worked 20-hour days, six days a week.

959
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:54,113
I was 19 years old.

960
01:06:56,120 --> 01:06:57,554
I loved every minute of it.

961
01:06:57,720 --> 01:07:01,714
The heat, the pressure, the violence,
the fucking screaming.

962
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:04,558
You know, all the cooks.

963
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:11,556
That kitchen is the only place
I've ever felt like I really belonged.

964
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:15,678
Why?

965
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:18,919
What happened in Paris?

966
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:22,953
I just fucked it all up.

967
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:26,155
Maybe it's...

968
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:31,558
Maybe I just wanted it really bad,
and then when I got it too early,

969
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:34,713
I didn't know how to hold on to it.
I tried to control everything.

970
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:38,436
Then when I wanted to escape from it...

971
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:45,389
Five o'clock's always the worst time
for thinking things.

972
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:47,870
I always think of things,
like I make a list of, like,

973
01:07:48,080 --> 01:07:49,753
things and people
I always think about right now.

It's like my mom,
my grandmother, Jean Luc.

975
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:53,878
It's like a broken fucking record.

976
01:07:57,160 --> 01:07:58,833
That woman at the party
was really pretty.

977
01:08:00,360 --> 01:08:03,159
- Is she on your list?
- Nope.

978
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,912

01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:17,318
What about Tony? Is he on your list?

982
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:18,880
Yeah, he's there.

983
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:22,793
I worry maybe I'm too hard on him.

984
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:24,997
At about 6:00, I decide it's okay.

And there's you.

987
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:33,073
- Wait, I'm on the list?
- Yeah, apparently so.

988
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:35,516
It's getting to be a long list.
No wonder I don't sleep.

989
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:37,956
Why are you thinking
about me at 5:00 a.m.?

990
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:43,551
I just think you and I
are exactly the same, you know?

991
01:08:44,680 --> 01:08:46,273
All we want to do...

992

(SOFTLY) This is a fucking stupid idea.

1001
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:39,757
