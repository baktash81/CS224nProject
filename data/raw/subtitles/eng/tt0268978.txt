1
00:01:23,663 --> 00:01:27,429
Princeton University
September 1947

2
00:01:29,503 --> 00:01:31,994
Mathematicians
won the war.

3
00:01:32,739 --> 00:01:35,731
Mathematicians broke
theJapanese codes...

4
00:01:35,809 --> 00:01:38,209
and built the A-bomb.

5
00:01:38,278 --> 00:01:41,679
Mathematicians...
like you.

6
00:01:42,416 --> 00:01:46,443
The stated goal of the Soviets
is global communism.

7
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,715
In medicine
or economics,

8
00:01:48,789 --> 00:01:51,053
in technology or space,

9
00:01:51,124 --> 00:01:52,955
battle lines are being drawn.

10
00:01:53,693 --> 00:01:56,719
To triumph, we need results.

11
00:01:56,797 --> 00:01:59,664
Publishable, applicable results.

12
00:01:59,866 --> 00:02:05,600
Now who among you
will be the next Morse?
The next Einstein?

13
00:02:06,339 --> 00:02:08,705
Who among you will be
the vanguard

14
00:02:08,775 --> 00:02:12,267
of democracy, freedom,
and discovery?

15
00:02:12,345 --> 00:02:15,041
Today, we bequeath
America's future

16
00:02:15,115 --> 00:02:17,777
into your able hands.

17
00:02:17,851 --> 00:02:20,718
Welcome to Princeton, gentlemen.

18
00:02:37,804 --> 00:02:40,204
Man:
It's not enough Hansen won
the Carnegie Scholarship.

19
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,300
Man #2:
No, he has to have it
all for himself.

20
00:02:43,376 --> 00:02:44,900
It's the first time
the Carnegie prize

21
00:02:44,978 --> 00:02:46,570
has been split.
Hansen's all bent.

22
00:02:46,646 --> 00:02:49,114
Man #2.
Rumor is he's got his sights
set on Wheeler Lab,

23
00:02:49,182 --> 00:02:50,877
the new military
think tank at M.I.T.

24
00:02:50,951 --> 00:02:53,647
They're only taking
one this year.

25
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,881
Hansen's used
to being picked first.

26
00:02:55,956 --> 00:02:57,514
Oh, yeah,
he's wasted on math.

27
00:02:57,591 --> 00:02:59,456
He should be running
for president.

28
00:03:09,603 --> 00:03:11,366
There could be
a mathematical explanation

29
00:03:11,438 --> 00:03:13,065
for how bad your tie is.

30
00:03:14,174 --> 00:03:16,506
(Laughs)

31
00:03:18,778 --> 00:03:20,370
Thank you.

32
00:03:21,781 --> 00:03:23,681
Neilson, symbol cryptography.

33
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:24,978
Neils here broke a Jap code.

34
00:03:25,018 --> 00:03:27,282
Helped rid the world of fascism.

35
00:03:27,354 --> 00:03:29,982
At least that's what
he tells the girls, eh, Neils?

36
00:03:30,056 --> 00:03:31,921
The name's Bender.
Atomic physics.

37
00:03:31,992 --> 00:03:34,051
- And you are?
- Am I late?

38
00:03:34,127 --> 00:03:35,389
- Yes.
- Yes, Mr. Sol.

39
00:03:35,462 --> 00:03:37,692
Oh, good.
Uh, hi.

40
00:03:37,764 --> 00:03:40,892
- Sol. Richard Sol.
- Neilson. The burden of genius.

41
00:03:40,967 --> 00:03:43,435
- Bender: There he is.
- So many supplicants,
and so little time.

42
00:03:43,503 --> 00:03:45,198
- Mr. Sol.
- How are you, sir?

43
00:03:45,272 --> 00:03:46,739
- Ah, Bender.
- Nice to see you.

44
00:03:46,806 --> 00:03:49,172
- Congratulations, Mr. Hansen.
- Ah, thank you.

45
00:03:49,242 --> 00:03:51,676
I'll take another.

46
00:03:52,746 --> 00:03:53,713
Excuse me?

47
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:56,305
A thousand pardons.
I simply assumed you
were the waiter.

48
00:03:56,383 --> 00:03:58,817
- Play nice, Hansen.
- Nice is not Hansen's
strong suit.

49
00:03:58,885 --> 00:04:00,113
Hansen.
Honest mistake.

50
00:04:00,186 --> 00:04:02,654
Well, Martin Hansen.

51
00:04:03,223 --> 00:04:04,690
It is Martin, isn't it?

52
00:04:05,258 --> 00:04:07,123
Why, yes, John, it is.

53
00:04:07,193 --> 00:04:10,720
I imagine you're getting
quite used to miscalculation.

54
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:15,361
I've read your pre-prints...

55
00:04:16,436 --> 00:04:18,131
Both of them.

56
00:04:18,204 --> 00:04:20,104
The one on Nazi ciphers,

57
00:04:20,173 --> 00:04:23,108
and the other one
on non-linear equations,

58
00:04:23,176 --> 00:04:24,837
and I am supremely confident

59
00:04:24,911 --> 00:04:26,503
that there is not
a single seminal

60
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,480
or innovative idea
in either one of them.

61
00:04:31,785 --> 00:04:33,844
Enjoy your punch.

62
00:04:35,956 --> 00:04:37,685
(Chuckles)

63
00:04:37,757 --> 00:04:39,588
Gentlemen, meetJohn Nash,

64
00:04:40,327 --> 00:04:42,852
the mysterious
West Virginia genius.

65
00:04:42,929 --> 00:04:45,591
The other winner of
the distinguished Carnegie Scholarship.

66
00:04:45,665 --> 00:04:47,633
- Bender. Oh, okay.
- Sol. Oh, yeah?

67
00:04:47,701 --> 00:04:48,998
Bender.
Of course.

68
00:05:01,848 --> 00:05:04,612
(Choral Record Playing)

69
00:05:19,766 --> 00:05:21,358
(Coughs)
Oh, Christ.

70
00:05:23,269 --> 00:05:26,432
The prodigal
roommate arrives.

71
00:05:26,506 --> 00:05:28,269
Roommate?

72
00:05:28,341 --> 00:05:30,104
Oh, God, no.

73
00:05:30,176 --> 00:05:32,235
- Ugh.
- (Music Slows, Stops)

74
00:05:32,312 --> 00:05:36,043
Did you know that having
a hangover is...

75
00:05:36,116 --> 00:05:38,243
Is not having enough water
in your body

76
00:05:38,318 --> 00:05:40,343
to run your Krebs cycles?

77
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:43,355
Which is exactly
what happens to you

78
00:05:43,423 --> 00:05:44,981
when you're dying
of thirst.

79
00:05:45,058 --> 00:05:48,027
So, dying
of thirst...

80
00:05:48,595 --> 00:05:51,325
would probably feel

81
00:05:51,398 --> 00:05:53,992
pretty much like
the hangover

82
00:05:54,067 --> 00:05:56,331
that finally
bloody kills you.

83
00:05:56,403 --> 00:05:57,700
(Chuckles)

84
00:05:57,771 --> 00:05:59,170
John Nash?

85
00:05:59,239 --> 00:06:01,139
Hello.

86
00:06:01,207 --> 00:06:02,697
Charles Herman.

87
00:06:02,776 --> 00:06:04,801
Pleased to meet you.

88
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:16,147
Player:
All right,
well done.

89
00:06:21,494 --> 00:06:23,155
Charles.
Well, it's official.

90
00:06:23,229 --> 00:06:25,322
I'm almost human again.

91
00:06:25,398 --> 00:06:27,127
Officer, I saw
the driver who hit me.

92
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,929
His name was Johnny Walker.

93
00:06:29,002 --> 00:06:30,697
(Mimics Rimshot)

94
00:06:32,272 --> 00:06:34,103
Whew.

95
00:06:34,674 --> 00:06:36,608
Well, I got in last night

96
00:06:36,676 --> 00:06:37,768
in time for...

97
00:06:37,844 --> 00:06:39,971
English department
cocktails.

98
00:06:40,046 --> 00:06:41,377
Cock was mine,

99
00:06:41,448 --> 00:06:43,780
the tail belonged
to a particularly lovely
young thing

100
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:46,444
with a passion
for...

101
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:50,046
D.H. Lawrence.
You're not easily
distracted, are you?

102
00:06:50,123 --> 00:06:52,956
- I'm here to work.
- Hmmm, are you? Right.

103
00:06:53,026 --> 00:06:54,857
I see.
Crikey!

104
00:07:04,204 --> 00:07:06,502
Is my roommate a dick?

105
00:07:07,741 --> 00:07:10,175
Hmm?

106
00:07:10,243 --> 00:07:12,336
Listen.

107
00:07:12,412 --> 00:07:13,777
If we can't break the ice...

108
00:07:15,148 --> 00:07:17,116
How about we drown it?

109
00:07:27,093 --> 00:07:28,890
So what's your story?

110
00:07:30,063 --> 00:07:33,089
You the poor kid
that never got to go
to Exeter or Andover?

111
00:07:34,134 --> 00:07:35,658
Despite my privileged
upbringing,

112
00:07:35,735 --> 00:07:37,134
I'm actually
quite well-balanced.

113
00:07:37,203 --> 00:07:38,602
I have a chip
on both shoulders.

114
00:07:38,671 --> 00:07:40,468
(Chuckles)

115
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,565
Maybe you're just better

116
00:07:42,642 --> 00:07:44,576
with the old integers
than you are with people.

117
00:07:44,644 --> 00:07:46,509
My first grade teacher,
she told me

118
00:07:46,579 --> 00:07:48,570
that I was born
with two helpings of brain,

119
00:07:48,648 --> 00:07:50,275
but only half
a helping of heart.

120
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:51,749
(Chuckles)

121
00:07:51,818 --> 00:07:54,184
Wow! She sounds lovely!

122
00:07:54,921 --> 00:07:56,786
The truth is that l...

123
00:07:56,856 --> 00:07:59,222
I don't like people much.

124
00:07:59,292 --> 00:08:01,453
And they don't much like me.

125
00:08:01,528 --> 00:08:02,756
But why,

126
00:08:02,829 --> 00:08:04,524
with all your obvious
wit and charm?

127
00:08:04,597 --> 00:08:06,087
(Laughs)

128
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,761
Seriously, John.

129
00:08:10,336 --> 00:08:12,201
Mathematics...

130
00:08:12,272 --> 00:08:16,072
Mathematics is
never going to lead you
to a higher truth.

131
00:08:16,142 --> 00:08:18,133
And you know why?

132
00:08:18,211 --> 00:08:19,644
'Cause it's boring.

133
00:08:19,712 --> 00:08:21,304
It's really boring.
(Chuckles)

134
00:08:22,048 --> 00:08:24,710
You know half these schoolboys
are already published?

135
00:08:25,785 --> 00:08:29,312
I cannot waste time
with these classes...

136
00:08:29,389 --> 00:08:31,152
and these books.

137
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:33,591
(Coughs)

138
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:36,151
Memorizing
the weaker assumptions
of lesser mortals!

139
00:08:36,229 --> 00:08:38,595
(Chuckles)

140
00:08:38,665 --> 00:08:41,429
I need to look through...

141
00:08:41,501 --> 00:08:43,594
to the governing dynamics.

142
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,908
Find a truly original idea.

143
00:08:49,976 --> 00:08:51,967
That's the only way
I'll ever distinguish myself.

144
00:08:52,045 --> 00:08:53,637
It's the only way
that I'll ever...

145
00:08:53,713 --> 00:08:55,112
Matter.

146
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:59,611
Yes.

147
00:09:01,221 --> 00:09:02,449
Hansen:
All right, who's next?

148
00:09:02,522 --> 00:09:04,649
No, I've played enough "go"
for one day, thank you.

149
00:09:04,724 --> 00:09:06,316
- Come on.
- l... I hate this game.

150
00:09:06,392 --> 00:09:08,155
Cowards, all of you!

151
00:09:08,228 --> 00:09:10,093
None of you rise
to meet my challenge?

152
00:09:10,163 --> 00:09:11,721
Come on, Bender.
Whoever wins,

153
00:09:11,798 --> 00:09:13,823
Sol does his laundry
all semester.

154
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:16,630
- Does that seem unfair
to anyone else?
- Not at all.

155
00:09:18,838 --> 00:09:21,068
- Bender. Look at him.
- Nash!

156
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,767
Taking a reverse
constitutional?

157
00:09:22,842 --> 00:09:24,639
I'm hoping to extract
an algorithm

158
00:09:24,711 --> 00:09:26,702
to define
their movement.

159
00:09:29,282 --> 00:09:32,217
- Oh.
- Psycho.

160
00:09:33,419 --> 00:09:35,080
Sol:
Hey, Nash, I thought
you dropped out.

161
00:09:35,154 --> 00:09:36,781
You ever going
to go to class or...

162
00:09:36,856 --> 00:09:39,154
Classes will dull your mind.

163
00:09:39,225 --> 00:09:42,717
Destroy the potential
for authentic creativity.

164
00:09:42,795 --> 00:09:44,729
Oh, oh, I didn't
know that.

165
00:09:44,797 --> 00:09:46,890
Nash is going to stun us all
with his genius.

166
00:09:46,966 --> 00:09:48,558
Which is another way
of saying

167
00:09:48,635 --> 00:09:50,626
he doesn't have
the nerve to compete.

168
00:09:52,538 --> 00:09:53,903
You scared?

169
00:09:53,973 --> 00:09:55,406
Terrified.

170
00:09:55,475 --> 00:09:56,840
Mortified.
Petrified.

171
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,605
Stupefied... by you.

172
00:09:59,612 --> 00:10:01,239
No starch.

173
00:10:01,314 --> 00:10:03,305
Pressed and folded.

174
00:10:06,286 --> 00:10:08,220
Let me ask
you something, John.

175
00:10:08,288 --> 00:10:10,119
Be my guest, Martin.

176
00:10:10,189 --> 00:10:11,952
Bender and Sol here
correctly completed

177
00:10:12,025 --> 00:10:14,084
Allen's proof
of Peyrot's Conjecture.

178
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,219
Adequate work...

179
00:10:16,296 --> 00:10:17,991
without innovation.

180
00:10:18,064 --> 00:10:19,827
Oh. I'm flattered.
You flattered?

181
00:10:19,899 --> 00:10:21,025
Flattered.

182
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,295
And I've got
two weapons briefs

183
00:10:23,369 --> 00:10:25,769
under security review
by the D.O.D.

184
00:10:25,838 --> 00:10:28,033
Derivative drivel.

185
00:10:29,042 --> 00:10:30,907
But Nash achievements:

186
00:10:30,977 --> 00:10:32,376
zero.

187
00:10:32,445 --> 00:10:35,175
I'm a patient man, Martin.
Is there an actual
question coming?

188
00:10:35,248 --> 00:10:39,685
What if you never come up
with your original idea?

189
00:10:39,752 --> 00:10:41,720
Huh?

190
00:10:41,788 --> 00:10:44,256
How will it feel
when I'm chosen for Wheeler...

191
00:10:45,325 --> 00:10:47,486
and you're not?

192
00:10:49,829 --> 00:10:52,195
What if you lose?

193
00:10:55,234 --> 00:10:58,101
Bender.
Ah, there it is.

194
00:10:58,171 --> 00:10:59,570
(Chuckles)

195
00:11:02,942 --> 00:11:04,375
You should not have won.

196
00:11:04,444 --> 00:11:05,877
Hmmm.

197
00:11:05,945 --> 00:11:08,539
I had the first move,
my... my play was perfect.

198
00:11:08,614 --> 00:11:10,104
The hubris
of the defeated.

199
00:11:10,183 --> 00:11:12,413
The game is flawed.

200
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:21,450
Gentlemen,
the greatJohn Nash.

201
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,127
Charles.
You've been in here
for two days.

202
00:11:33,272 --> 00:11:36,002
You know Hansen's
just published another paper?

203
00:11:36,075 --> 00:11:38,270
I can't even find a topic
for my doctorate.

204
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,506
Well, on the bright side,
you've invented window art.

205
00:11:45,818 --> 00:11:48,378
This is a group
playing touch football.

206
00:11:48,454 --> 00:11:51,855
This is a cluster of pigeons
fighting over bread crumbs.

207
00:11:53,993 --> 00:11:57,485
And this here is a woman
who is chasing a man
who stole her purse.

208
00:11:58,865 --> 00:12:00,628
John, you watched
a mugging.

209
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,167
That's weird.

210
00:12:02,235 --> 00:12:04,931
In competitive behavior
someone always loses.

211
00:12:05,004 --> 00:12:08,701
Well, my niece knows that,
John, and she's about this high.

212
00:12:08,775 --> 00:12:12,108
See, if I could derive
an equilibrium

213
00:12:12,178 --> 00:12:14,738
where prevalence is
a non-singular event,

214
00:12:14,814 --> 00:12:17,146
where nobody loses,

215
00:12:17,216 --> 00:12:19,241
can you imagine the effect
that would have

216
00:12:19,318 --> 00:12:23,254
- on conflict scenarios,
and arms negotiations...
- When did you last eat?

217
00:12:23,322 --> 00:12:25,790
- When did you last eat?
...Currency exchange?

218
00:12:25,858 --> 00:12:27,621
You know, food.

219
00:12:29,028 --> 00:12:31,656
You have no respect
for cognitive reverie,
you know that?

220
00:12:31,731 --> 00:12:34,291
Yes. But pizza...

221
00:12:35,902 --> 00:12:38,803
Now, pizza I have
enormous respect for.

222
00:12:38,871 --> 00:12:41,965
And of course beer.

223
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:50,074
I have respect for beer.

224
00:12:51,384 --> 00:12:53,909
I have respect for beer!

225
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,660
- Bender. Good evening, Neils.
- Hansen. Hey, Nash.

226
00:13:03,729 --> 00:13:05,663
Who's winning?
You or you?

227
00:13:05,731 --> 00:13:08,427
- Bender. Evening, Nash.
- Sol. Hey, guys.

228
00:13:08,501 --> 00:13:10,366
Hey, Nash.

229
00:13:10,436 --> 00:13:13,234
Woman:
He's looking
at you for sure.

230
00:13:17,944 --> 00:13:19,536
Hey, Nash.

231
00:13:19,612 --> 00:13:21,239
Neils is trying
to get your attention.

232
00:13:21,314 --> 00:13:23,646
- Bender. You're joking.
- Sol. Oh, no.

233
00:13:29,288 --> 00:13:31,381
- Go with God.
- Come back a man.

234
00:13:32,725 --> 00:13:35,523
- Fortune favors the brave.
- Bombs away.

235
00:13:37,797 --> 00:13:41,631
Gentlemen, might I remind you
that my odds of success

236
00:13:41,701 --> 00:13:43,669
dramatically improve
with each attempt?

237
00:13:52,812 --> 00:13:55,337
This is going
to be classic.

238
00:14:25,111 --> 00:14:27,978
Maybe you want
to buy me a drink.

239
00:14:32,685 --> 00:14:34,812
I don't exactly know
what I'm required to say

240
00:14:34,887 --> 00:14:36,946
in order for you
to have intercourse with me,

241
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:40,684
but could we assume
that I said all that?

242
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:43,627
Essentially we're talking
about fluid exchange, right?

243
00:14:43,696 --> 00:14:45,630
So, could we just
go straight to the sex?

244
00:14:46,766 --> 00:14:48,631
Oh, that was sweet.

245
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:52,663
Have a nice night,
asshole!

246
00:14:52,738 --> 00:14:54,899
- (Man Laughs)
- Neilson. Ladies, wait!

247
00:14:56,008 --> 00:14:57,600
Charles. l...

248
00:14:57,677 --> 00:15:00,111
I especially liked
the bit about fluid exchange.

249
00:15:00,179 --> 00:15:02,739
It was really charming.

250
00:15:06,719 --> 00:15:08,482
Professor.
Walk with me, John.

251
00:15:08,554 --> 00:15:10,317
I've been meaning
to talk with you.

252
00:15:10,389 --> 00:15:15,053
The faculty is completing
mid-year reviews.

253
00:15:15,127 --> 00:15:18,290
We're deciding which placement
applications to support.

254
00:15:18,364 --> 00:15:20,093
Wheeler, sir.
That would be
my first choice.

255
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:22,430
And actually,
I don't really have
a second choice, sir.

256
00:15:22,501 --> 00:15:25,129
John, your fellows
have attended classes.

257
00:15:25,204 --> 00:15:26,831
They've written papers.
They've published.

258
00:15:26,906 --> 00:15:29,033
I'm still searching, sir,
for my...

259
00:15:29,108 --> 00:15:31,633
- Your original idea, I know.
- Governing dynamics, sir.

260
00:15:31,711 --> 00:15:33,372
It's very clever, John,
but I'm afraid

261
00:15:33,446 --> 00:15:35,710
it's just not nearly
good enough.

262
00:15:41,821 --> 00:15:43,652
- May I?
- Thank you.

263
00:15:44,757 --> 00:15:46,384
I've been working
on manifold embedding.

264
00:15:46,459 --> 00:15:48,859
My bargaining stratagems
are starting to show
some promise.

265
00:15:48,928 --> 00:15:50,589
If you could just
arrange another meeting,

266
00:15:50,663 --> 00:15:52,062
if you'd be kind enough,
with Professor Einstein...

267
00:15:52,098 --> 00:15:54,123
- I've repeatedly asked
you for that.
- Now, John.

268
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:56,634
I'd be able to show him
my revisions on his...

269
00:15:56,702 --> 00:15:58,169
John.

270
00:15:59,572 --> 00:16:01,665
Do you see what they're
doing in there?

271
00:16:01,741 --> 00:16:03,402
- Professor. Congratulations.
- Max. Thank you so much.

272
00:16:04,477 --> 00:16:07,344
Congratulations,
Professor Max.

273
00:16:07,413 --> 00:16:09,813
- Max. Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

274
00:16:10,816 --> 00:16:12,283
It's the pens.

275
00:16:12,351 --> 00:16:14,615
Reserved for a member
of the department

276
00:16:14,687 --> 00:16:16,587
that makes the achievement
of a lifetime.

277
00:16:17,657 --> 00:16:19,318
Now, what do you see, John?

278
00:16:20,393 --> 00:16:22,122
Recognition.

279
00:16:22,194 --> 00:16:24,958
Well done, Professor,
well done.

280
00:16:25,031 --> 00:16:27,465
Well, try seeing
accomplishment.

281
00:16:27,533 --> 00:16:29,330
Is there a difference?

282
00:16:29,402 --> 00:16:30,699
John,

283
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:33,261
you haven't focused.

284
00:16:34,707 --> 00:16:37,801
I'm sorry,
but up to this point,

285
00:16:37,877 --> 00:16:40,573
your record doesn't warrant
any placement at all.

286
00:16:43,449 --> 00:16:45,644
Good day.

287
00:16:55,328 --> 00:16:57,990
And my compliments
to you, sir.

288
00:16:58,064 --> 00:17:00,157
Thank you so much.

289
00:17:16,782 --> 00:17:18,750
I can't see it.

290
00:17:18,818 --> 00:17:20,786
(Whimpers)

291
00:17:25,224 --> 00:17:28,091
- Aah!
- Jesus Christ, John.

292
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,560
I can't fail.

293
00:17:30,629 --> 00:17:33,530
- This is all I am.
- Come on, let's go out.

294
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:35,590
- I got to get
something done.
- John!

295
00:17:35,668 --> 00:17:38,501
- I can't keep
staring into space.
- John, enough!

296
00:17:38,571 --> 00:17:41,096
Got to face the wall,
follow their rules,
read their books...

297
00:17:41,173 --> 00:17:42,663
you want to do
some damage? Fine...

298
00:17:42,742 --> 00:17:44,801
- But don't mess around.
...Do their classes.

299
00:17:44,877 --> 00:17:46,970
Come on!
Go on, bust your head!

300
00:17:47,046 --> 00:17:48,741
Kill yourself.

301
00:17:48,814 --> 00:17:51,180
John, do it.
Don't mess around.

302
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:52,979
Bust your head!
Go on,

303
00:17:53,052 --> 00:17:55,020
bust that worthless head
wide open.

304
00:17:55,087 --> 00:17:57,214
Goddamn it, Charles!
What the hell is
your problem?!

305
00:18:01,093 --> 00:18:03,220
It's not my problem.

306
00:18:03,295 --> 00:18:06,560
And it's not your problem.

307
00:18:09,468 --> 00:18:11,834
It's their problem.

308
00:18:11,904 --> 00:18:14,998
Your answer isn't
face the wall.

309
00:18:15,074 --> 00:18:17,440
It's out there...

310
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:19,137
where you've been working.

311
00:18:35,361 --> 00:18:36,760
- (Panting)
- (Gasps)

312
00:18:40,866 --> 00:18:42,857
That was heavy.

313
00:18:45,871 --> 00:18:48,601
That Isaac Newton fellow
was right.

314
00:18:48,674 --> 00:18:50,471
- He was onto something.
- Clever boy.

315
00:18:50,543 --> 00:18:51,771
(Giggles)

316
00:18:51,844 --> 00:18:53,539
John.
Don't worry, that's mine.

317
00:18:53,612 --> 00:18:55,807
I'll come and get it
in a minute.

318
00:18:55,881 --> 00:18:58,281
- (Both laughing)
- Oh, God.

319
00:19:00,219 --> 00:19:03,416
- Neilson. Incoming, gentlemen.
- Sol. Ay-yi-yi.

320
00:19:06,225 --> 00:19:10,161
(Sighs)
Deep breaths.

321
00:19:10,229 --> 00:19:11,924
Sol. Nash, you might
want to stop

322
00:19:11,997 --> 00:19:15,228
shuffling your papers
for five seconds.

323
00:19:18,471 --> 00:19:20,530
I will not buy
you gentlemen beer.

324
00:19:20,606 --> 00:19:23,166
Bender.
Oh, we're not here
for beer, my friend.

325
00:19:24,276 --> 00:19:26,403
- John. Oh.
- (Sol Chuckles)

326
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,576
Does anyone else feel she should be
moving in slow motion?

327
00:19:30,649 --> 00:19:33,311
Will she want
a large wedding, ya think?

328
00:19:33,385 --> 00:19:34,852
Shall we say swords, gentlemen?

329
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,889
- Pistols at dawn?
- Have you remembered nothing?

330
00:19:37,957 --> 00:19:40,289
Recall the lessons
of Adam Smith,

331
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:42,293
the father
of modern economics.

332
00:19:42,361 --> 00:19:44,192
"In competition...

333
00:19:44,263 --> 00:19:46,925
Sol and Neilson:
individual ambition
serves the common good."

334
00:19:46,999 --> 00:19:49,331
- Exactly.
- Every man for himself,
gentlemen.

335
00:19:49,401 --> 00:19:52,393
Bender:
And those who strike out
are stuck with her friends.

336
00:19:52,471 --> 00:19:54,063
Hansen.
I'm not gonna strike out.

337
00:19:54,139 --> 00:19:56,869
Sol.
You can lead a blonde to water,
but you can't make her drink.

338
00:19:56,942 --> 00:19:58,933
- I don't think he said that.
- Sol: Nobody move...

339
00:19:59,011 --> 00:20:01,070
She's looking over here.
She's looking at Nash.

340
00:20:01,146 --> 00:20:03,842
Hansen.
Oh, God. He may have
the upper hand now,

341
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:05,975
but wait until he
opens his mouth.

342
00:20:06,051 --> 00:20:07,916
- (Laughing)
- Remember the last time?

343
00:20:07,987 --> 00:20:10,512
Bender.
Oh, yes, that was one
for the history books.

344
00:20:16,529 --> 00:20:18,292
Adam Smith needs revision.

345
00:20:18,364 --> 00:20:20,332
What are you
talking about?

346
00:20:20,399 --> 00:20:23,061
If we all go for the blonde...

347
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,198
we block each other.

348
00:20:30,442 --> 00:20:33,536
Not a single one of us
is gonna get her.

349
00:20:33,612 --> 00:20:36,274
So then we go
for her friends,

350
00:20:37,483 --> 00:20:39,110
but they will all
give us the cold shoulder

351
00:20:39,184 --> 00:20:41,744
because nobody likes
to be second choice.

352
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:44,755
Well, what if no one goes
for the blonde?

353
00:20:46,358 --> 00:20:48,588
We don't get
in each other's way,

354
00:20:48,661 --> 00:20:51,596
and we don't insult
the other girls.

355
00:20:52,698 --> 00:20:54,962
That's the only way we win.

356
00:20:56,669 --> 00:20:58,534
That's the only
way we all get laid.

357
00:20:58,604 --> 00:21:00,094
(Laughs)

358
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:06,341
Adam Smith said

359
00:21:06,412 --> 00:21:08,437
the best result comes

360
00:21:08,514 --> 00:21:10,106
from everyone
in the group doing

361
00:21:10,182 --> 00:21:11,672
what's best
for himself, right?

362
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:12,910
That's what he
said, right?

363
00:21:12,985 --> 00:21:14,145
- Right.
- Incomplete.

364
00:21:14,219 --> 00:21:15,811
Incomplete, okay?

365
00:21:15,888 --> 00:21:18,448
Because the best result
will come...

366
00:21:19,525 --> 00:21:21,186
from everyone in the group

367
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:23,956
doing what's best for himself...

368
00:21:24,029 --> 00:21:25,587
and the group.

369
00:21:25,664 --> 00:21:28,531
Nash, if this is some way
for you to get the blonde
on your own,

370
00:21:28,601 --> 00:21:30,865
- you can go to hell.
- Governing dynamics.

371
00:21:30,936 --> 00:21:33,962
Governing dynamics.
Adam Smith...

372
00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:35,734
was wrong.

373
00:21:35,808 --> 00:21:38,606
- Sol: Oh, here we go.
- Neilson: Careful, careful.

374
00:21:40,813 --> 00:21:42,872
Thank you.

375
00:21:54,593 --> 00:21:57,494
"C" of"S" equals
"C" of"T."

376
00:21:58,797 --> 00:22:00,424
(Muttering)

377
00:22:59,758 --> 00:23:01,851
You do realize this
flies in the face

378
00:23:01,927 --> 00:23:04,691
- of a 1 50 years
of economic theory?
- Yes, I do, sir.

379
00:23:04,763 --> 00:23:06,628
That's rather presumptuous,
don't you think?

380
00:23:06,699 --> 00:23:08,564
It is, sir.
(Stifled Laugh)

381
00:23:15,207 --> 00:23:16,936
Well, Mr. Nash,

382
00:23:18,143 --> 00:23:20,373
with a breakthrough
of this magnitude,

383
00:23:20,446 --> 00:23:24,212
I'm confident you will get
any placement you like.

384
00:23:30,289 --> 00:23:32,519
Wheeler Labs,

385
00:23:32,591 --> 00:23:36,220
they'll ask you to recommend
two team members.

386
00:23:36,295 --> 00:23:37,887
(Whispering)
Yes!

387
00:23:39,465 --> 00:23:42,229
Stills and Frank
are excellent choices.

388
00:23:42,301 --> 00:23:43,962
Sol and Bender, sir.

389
00:23:44,036 --> 00:23:47,665
Sol and Bender are
extraordinary mathematicians.

390
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:49,799
Has it occurred to you
that Sol and Bender

391
00:23:49,875 --> 00:23:51,433
might have plans
of their own?

392
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,607
(Laughing)

393
00:23:56,682 --> 00:23:59,480
- Baby!
- Wheeler, we made it!

394
00:23:59,551 --> 00:24:04,682
- Cheers, cheers, cheers!
- To... oh! Oh!

395
00:24:04,757 --> 00:24:07,385
Okay, awkward moment,
gentlemen.

396
00:24:26,979 --> 00:24:29,948
Umm...

397
00:24:30,015 --> 00:24:31,710
hmm.

398
00:24:31,784 --> 00:24:34,082
Governing dynamics.

399
00:24:36,455 --> 00:24:38,685
- Congratulations, John.
- Thanks.

400
00:24:38,757 --> 00:24:40,520
- Toast!
- To Wheeler Labs!

401
00:24:40,592 --> 00:24:42,355
Neilson.
To Wheeler!

402
00:24:51,937 --> 00:24:56,033
The Pentagon 1 953
Five Years Later

403
00:25:06,318 --> 00:25:08,878
Man.
General, the analyst
from Wheeler Lab is here.

404
00:25:08,954 --> 00:25:10,854
Dr. Nash, your coat?

405
00:25:10,923 --> 00:25:12,823
Thank you, sir.

406
00:25:12,891 --> 00:25:16,827
Doctor. General, this is
Wheeler team leader
Dr. John Nash.

407
00:25:16,895 --> 00:25:18,988
Glad you could
come, Doctor.

408
00:25:19,064 --> 00:25:20,190
Hello.

409
00:25:20,265 --> 00:25:22,096
Right this way.

410
00:25:22,167 --> 00:25:26,001
We've been intercepting
radio transmissions from Moscow.

411
00:25:26,071 --> 00:25:28,505
The computer can't
detect a pattern,

412
00:25:28,574 --> 00:25:30,269
but I'm sure it's code.

413
00:25:30,342 --> 00:25:32,708
John:
Why is that, General?

414
00:25:32,778 --> 00:25:35,269
Ever just know
something, Dr. Nash?

415
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:39,511
Constantly.

416
00:25:41,753 --> 00:25:43,914
General.
We've developed several ciphers.

417
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:48,020
If you'd like to review
our preliminary data...

418
00:25:50,162 --> 00:25:51,527
Doctor?

419
00:25:51,597 --> 00:25:53,121
Nash's voice.
6-7-3-7,

420
00:25:53,198 --> 00:25:55,098
0-3-6...

421
00:25:55,167 --> 00:25:56,998
(Mental Voice)

422
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:10,771
8-4-9-4.

423
00:26:12,684 --> 00:26:15,346
(Continues Listing Numbers)

424
00:26:41,546 --> 00:26:43,571
9-1-4-0-3-4.

425
00:27:00,265 --> 00:27:01,857
I need a map.

426
00:27:04,636 --> 00:27:06,126
46-1 3-08,

427
00:27:06,204 --> 00:27:08,798
67-46-90.

428
00:27:10,776 --> 00:27:12,971
Starkey Corners, Maine.

429
00:27:13,979 --> 00:27:15,606
48-03-01,

430
00:27:15,681 --> 00:27:19,048
91 -26-3 5.

431
00:27:19,117 --> 00:27:21,176
Prairie Portage,
Minnesota.

432
00:27:21,253 --> 00:27:24,450
These are latitudes
and longitudes.

433
00:27:24,523 --> 00:27:25,922
There are a least 1 0 others.

434
00:27:25,991 --> 00:27:28,755
They appear to be routing orders
across the border into the U.S.

435
00:27:30,362 --> 00:27:33,195
Extraordinary.

436
00:27:33,265 --> 00:27:36,826
Gentlemen, we need
to move on this.

437
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:39,860
Who's big brother?

438
00:27:39,938 --> 00:27:42,338
You've done your country
a great service, son.

439
00:27:43,342 --> 00:27:46,106
- Captain!
- Yes, sir.

440
00:27:46,178 --> 00:27:48,544
Accompany Dr. Nash.

441
00:27:48,613 --> 00:27:51,548
What are the Russians
moving, general?

442
00:27:51,616 --> 00:27:53,208
Captain Rogers will escort you

443
00:27:53,285 --> 00:27:55,082
to the unrestricted area, Doctor.

444
00:27:55,153 --> 00:27:56,814
Thank you.

445
00:27:56,888 --> 00:27:59,288
Captain.
Dr. Nash, follow me, please.

446
00:28:06,198 --> 00:28:08,029
Man On Radio.
None of those who have

447
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,761
said they don't
like the method

448
00:28:09,835 --> 00:28:12,201
have told us any other method
they could use

449
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:13,828
that would be effective.

450
00:28:13,905 --> 00:28:15,998
- And when you hear...
- Driver: It's Dr. Nash.

451
00:28:16,074 --> 00:28:18,042
All right.

452
00:28:22,781 --> 00:28:26,615
Wheeler Defense Labs
MIT Campus

453
00:28:31,089 --> 00:28:33,353
- Thank you, sir.
- Home run at the Pentagon?

454
00:28:33,392 --> 00:28:35,792
Have they actually
taken the word "classified"

455
00:28:35,861 --> 00:28:37,021
out of the dictionary?

456
00:28:37,596 --> 00:28:40,030
Oh, hi.
The air conditioning broke again.

457
00:28:40,098 --> 00:28:42,157
How am I supposed to be
in here saving the world

458
00:28:42,234 --> 00:28:45,067
- if I'm melting?
- Our hearts go out to you.

459
00:28:45,137 --> 00:28:48,129
You know, two trips
to the Pentagon in four years.

460
00:28:48,206 --> 00:28:49,730
That's two more than we've had.

461
00:28:49,808 --> 00:28:51,241
It gets better, John.

462
00:28:51,309 --> 00:28:53,869
Just got our latest
scintillating assignment.

463
00:28:53,945 --> 00:28:55,879
You know, the Russians
have the H-bomb,

464
00:28:55,947 --> 00:28:58,040
the Nazis are repatriating
South America,

465
00:28:58,116 --> 00:29:01,415
the Chinese have
a standing army of 2.8 million,

466
00:29:01,486 --> 00:29:05,013
and I am doing
stress tests on a dam.

467
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:07,820
You made the cover
of Fortune... again.

468
00:29:07,893 --> 00:29:10,521
Please note the use
of the word "you," not "we."

469
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:13,523
That was supposed
to be just me.

470
00:29:13,598 --> 00:29:15,498
Oh.
(Laughs)

471
00:29:16,401 --> 00:29:18,301
So not only do they rob me
of the Fields medal,

472
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:20,702
now they put me on the cover
of Fortune magazine

473
00:29:20,772 --> 00:29:23,832
with these hacks,
these scholars of trivia.

474
00:29:23,909 --> 00:29:25,501
John, exactly what's
the difference

475
00:29:25,577 --> 00:29:27,909
between genius
and most genius?

476
00:29:27,979 --> 00:29:29,742
Quite a lot.

477
00:29:29,815 --> 00:29:32,079
He's your son.

478
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:33,549
Anyway, you've got 1 0 minutes.

479
00:29:33,618 --> 00:29:35,609
I've always got 1 0 minutes.

480
00:29:35,687 --> 00:29:37,655
Sol.
Before your new class?

481
00:29:42,627 --> 00:29:45,221
Can I not get a note
from a doctor or something?

482
00:29:45,797 --> 00:29:48,493
You are a doctor, John,
and no.

483
00:29:48,533 --> 00:29:50,228
Now, come on,
you know the drill,

484
00:29:50,302 --> 00:29:52,065
we get these
beautiful facilities,

485
00:29:52,137 --> 00:29:54,196
M.I.T. gets America's
great minds of today

486
00:29:54,272 --> 00:29:56,331
teaching America's
great minds of tomorrow.

487
00:29:56,408 --> 00:29:58,103
Poor bastards.

488
00:29:58,176 --> 00:30:00,235
Now, have a nice day at school.

489
00:30:00,312 --> 00:30:01,779
The bell's ringing.

490
00:30:10,889 --> 00:30:13,153
(Door Opens)

491
00:30:22,868 --> 00:30:25,302
The eager young minds
of tomorrow.

492
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:27,235
(LoudJackhammering)

493
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:37,207
Can we leave one open,
Professor?

494
00:30:37,282 --> 00:30:38,715
It's really hot, sir.

495
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:42,453
Your comfort comes second

496
00:30:42,521 --> 00:30:44,648
to my ability
to hear my own voice.

497
00:30:50,095 --> 00:30:52,393
Personally,

498
00:30:52,464 --> 00:30:54,432
I think this class
will be a waste...

499
00:30:54,499 --> 00:30:56,490
of your...

500
00:30:56,568 --> 00:30:58,433
And what is infinitely worse...

501
00:30:59,604 --> 00:31:01,970
my time.

502
00:31:02,974 --> 00:31:05,875
However, here we are.

503
00:31:05,944 --> 00:31:09,744
So you may attend or not.

504
00:31:09,814 --> 00:31:12,009
You may complete
your assignments at your whim.

505
00:31:12,083 --> 00:31:14,347
We have begun.

506
00:31:16,588 --> 00:31:17,953
Miss.

507
00:31:21,126 --> 00:31:23,185
Excuse me!

508
00:31:23,261 --> 00:31:25,729
- Excuse me!
- Hey, hey!

509
00:31:25,797 --> 00:31:27,560
Hi!

510
00:31:27,632 --> 00:31:30,567
Um, we have
a little problem.

511
00:31:30,635 --> 00:31:34,298
It's extremely hot in here
with the windows closed

512
00:31:34,339 --> 00:31:36,307
and extremely noisy
with them open.

513
00:31:36,341 --> 00:31:39,037
So, I was wondering
if there was any way you could,

514
00:31:39,077 --> 00:31:42,740
I don't know,
maybe work someplace else
for about 45 minutes?

515
00:31:42,781 --> 00:31:45,807
- Worker: Not a problem.
- Thank you so much!

516
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:48,444
- At a break!
- Got it!

517
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,681
Worker.
Let's go. Let's clean it
a little bit!

518
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:56,390
As you will find
in multivariable calculus,
there is often...

519
00:31:56,461 --> 00:31:58,929
a number of solutions
for any given problem.

520
00:32:02,701 --> 00:32:05,295
As I was saying,
this problem here

521
00:32:05,837 --> 00:32:09,364
will take some of you
many months to solve.

522
00:32:09,441 --> 00:32:12,103
For others among you,

523
00:32:12,177 --> 00:32:15,613
it will take you the term
of your natural lives.

524
00:32:29,894 --> 00:32:32,886
Man.
Professor Nash.

525
00:32:44,943 --> 00:32:46,604
William Parcher.

526
00:32:47,178 --> 00:32:49,738
Big brother,

527
00:32:49,814 --> 00:32:51,679
at your service.

528
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:54,378
What can I do
for the Department of Defense?

529
00:32:54,452 --> 00:32:56,317
Are you going to
to give me a raise?

530
00:32:56,388 --> 00:32:58,379
Let's take a walk.

531
00:32:59,724 --> 00:33:02,716
- Impressive work
at the Pentagon.
- Yes, it was.

532
00:33:02,794 --> 00:33:04,159
Oppenheimer used to say,

533
00:33:04,229 --> 00:33:06,754
"Genius sees the answer
before the question."

534
00:33:06,831 --> 00:33:08,765
You knew Oppenheimer?

535
00:33:08,833 --> 00:33:11,495
His project was
under my supervision.

536
00:33:11,569 --> 00:33:13,560
Which project?

537
00:33:15,173 --> 00:33:16,936
That project.

538
00:33:17,008 --> 00:33:18,669
It's not that simple,
you know?

539
00:33:18,743 --> 00:33:20,370
Well, you ended the war.

540
00:33:20,445 --> 00:33:24,074
We incinerated 1 50,000 people
in a heartbeat.

541
00:33:24,149 --> 00:33:27,016
Great deeds come
at great cost, Mr. Parcher.

542
00:33:27,752 --> 00:33:30,744
Well, conviction,
it turns out,

543
00:33:30,822 --> 00:33:34,121
is a luxury of those
on the sidelines, Mr. Nash.

544
00:33:35,827 --> 00:33:37,886
I'll try
and keep that in mind.

545
00:33:40,732 --> 00:33:43,895
So, John, no family,

546
00:33:43,968 --> 00:33:45,833
no close friends...

547
00:33:45,904 --> 00:33:47,394
Why is that?

548
00:33:47,472 --> 00:33:49,963
John:
I like to think it's
because I'm a lone wolf.

549
00:33:50,041 --> 00:33:53,772
But mainly it's because
people don't like me.

550
00:33:53,845 --> 00:33:55,073
(Chuckles)

551
00:33:55,146 --> 00:33:56,704
Well, there are
certain endeavors

552
00:33:56,781 --> 00:33:58,578
where your lack
of personal connection

553
00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:00,777
would be considered
an advantage.

554
00:34:02,554 --> 00:34:05,990
- This is a secure area.
- They know me.

555
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:10,218
Have you ever
been here?

556
00:34:10,295 --> 00:34:12,092
We were told during
our initial briefing

557
00:34:12,163 --> 00:34:14,154
that these warehouses
were abandoned.

558
00:34:14,232 --> 00:34:16,393
That's not precisely accurate.

559
00:34:22,574 --> 00:34:25,270
(Low Radio Chatter)

560
00:34:25,343 --> 00:34:28,540
(Tapes Screeching)

561
00:34:37,922 --> 00:34:40,186
(Sirens,
Man Speaking Russian)

562
00:34:53,304 --> 00:34:55,295
By telling you
what I'm about to tell you,

563
00:34:55,373 --> 00:34:57,102
I am increasing
your security clearance

564
00:34:57,175 --> 00:34:58,699
to top secret.

565
00:34:58,777 --> 00:35:02,543
Disclosure of secure information
can result in imprisonment.

566
00:35:02,614 --> 00:35:03,945
Get it?

567
00:35:04,015 --> 00:35:06,040
What operation?

568
00:35:11,556 --> 00:35:13,649
Those are a good idea.

569
00:35:17,395 --> 00:35:19,386
This factory is in Berlin.

570
00:35:19,464 --> 00:35:21,125
We seized it
at the end of the war.

571
00:35:21,199 --> 00:35:22,928
Nazi engineers were attempting

572
00:35:23,001 --> 00:35:25,595
to build a portable atomic bomb.

573
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:29,231
The Soviets reached
this facility before we did,
and we lost the damn thing.

574
00:35:32,343 --> 00:35:34,470
The routing orders
at the Pentagon,

575
00:35:34,546 --> 00:35:36,741
they were about this,
weren't they?

576
00:35:36,815 --> 00:35:40,615
The Soviets aren't
as unified as people believe.

577
00:35:40,685 --> 00:35:44,280
A faction of the Red Army
calling itself Novaya Svobga,

578
00:35:44,355 --> 00:35:46,721
"the New Freedom,"
has control of the bomb

579
00:35:46,791 --> 00:35:49,419
and intends to detonate it
on U.S. soil.

580
00:35:50,728 --> 00:35:54,391
Their plan is to incur
maximum civilian casualties.

581
00:35:58,336 --> 00:35:59,963
Parcher.
Man is capable
of as much atrocity

582
00:36:00,004 --> 00:36:02,268
as he has imagination.

583
00:36:03,808 --> 00:36:07,141
New Freedom has sleeper agents
here in the U.S.

584
00:36:08,046 --> 00:36:10,139
McCarthy is an idiot,

585
00:36:10,215 --> 00:36:12,274
but unfortunately
that doesn't make him wrong.

586
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:16,244
New Freedom communicates
to its agents

587
00:36:16,321 --> 00:36:19,154
through codes imbedded
in newspapers and magazines,

588
00:36:19,224 --> 00:36:20,816
and that's where you come in.

589
00:36:20,892 --> 00:36:22,325
You see, John,

590
00:36:22,393 --> 00:36:25,157
what distinguishes you

591
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:26,993
is that you are,

592
00:36:27,065 --> 00:36:28,657
quite simply,

593
00:36:28,733 --> 00:36:32,499
the best natural code-breaker
I have ever seen.

594
00:36:37,575 --> 00:36:41,067
What exactly is it
that you would like me to do?

595
00:36:46,084 --> 00:36:49,144
Commit this list
of periodicals to memory.

596
00:36:50,755 --> 00:36:54,282
Scan each new issue,
find any hidden codes,

597
00:36:54,359 --> 00:36:56,020
decipher them.

598
00:36:57,629 --> 00:37:00,223
Doctor:
Place your chin
on the chin rest.

599
00:37:00,298 --> 00:37:04,098
- Stare into the light.
- Man. Pulse 88, regular.

600
00:37:06,571 --> 00:37:09,062
Okay, this may be
a little uncomfortable.

601
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:11,768
(Groans)

602
00:37:11,843 --> 00:37:13,777
That's got
a little zap to it, doesn't it?

603
00:37:13,845 --> 00:37:17,076
He just implanted
a radium diode.

604
00:37:17,148 --> 00:37:19,207
Don't worry, it's safe.

605
00:37:20,218 --> 00:37:22,083
The isotope decays predictably.

606
00:37:22,153 --> 00:37:25,350
As a result,
these numbers change over time.

607
00:37:25,423 --> 00:37:28,824
They're the access codes
to your drop spot.

608
00:37:30,395 --> 00:37:33,728
So what am I now, a spy?

609
00:37:44,409 --> 00:37:48,470
- (Knocking)
- Come.

610
00:37:51,816 --> 00:37:54,478
Boy, you must be
really important.

611
00:38:02,193 --> 00:38:04,627
It's all right, Mike.

612
00:38:14,038 --> 00:38:15,300
What are you working on?

613
00:38:17,642 --> 00:38:19,303
Classified.

614
00:38:21,179 --> 00:38:22,976
Everyone waited
half an hour.

615
00:38:23,047 --> 00:38:24,742
For?

616
00:38:24,816 --> 00:38:26,784
Class.

617
00:38:26,851 --> 00:38:28,648
You missed class today.

618
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,154
Oh. I suspect that...

619
00:38:33,057 --> 00:38:34,786
nobody missed me.

620
00:38:34,859 --> 00:38:36,326
(Chuckles)

621
00:38:36,394 --> 00:38:38,453
The problem that you left
on the board...

622
00:38:39,664 --> 00:38:42,098
I solved it.

623
00:38:42,166 --> 00:38:43,861
Oh, no you didn't.

624
00:38:43,935 --> 00:38:46,335
You didn't even look.

625
00:38:46,404 --> 00:38:49,464
I never said
that the Vector Fields
were rational functions.

626
00:38:53,745 --> 00:38:56,009
Your solution is elegant.

627
00:38:58,016 --> 00:39:00,849
Though on this
particular occasion,

628
00:39:01,886 --> 00:39:03,945
ultimately incorrect.

629
00:39:25,376 --> 00:39:26,809
You're still here.

630
00:39:26,878 --> 00:39:28,743
I'm still here.

631
00:39:29,647 --> 00:39:31,308
Why?

632
00:39:31,382 --> 00:39:34,874
I'm wondering, Professor Nash,

633
00:39:36,487 --> 00:39:38,421
if I can ask you
to dinner.

634
00:39:42,694 --> 00:39:44,594
You do eat, don't you?

635
00:39:44,662 --> 00:39:47,096
Oh, on occasion, yeah.
(Chuckles)

636
00:39:47,165 --> 00:39:49,861
Table for one. Prometheus alone
chained to the rock

637
00:39:49,934 --> 00:39:52,232
with the bird circling overhead,
you know how it is.

638
00:39:52,303 --> 00:39:54,134
(Laughs)

639
00:39:55,406 --> 00:39:57,499
No, I expect
that you wouldn't...

640
00:39:57,575 --> 00:39:59,270
You wouldn't know.

641
00:40:01,612 --> 00:40:04,274
If you leave your address
with my office,

642
00:40:04,348 --> 00:40:07,476
I'll pick you up
Friday at 8:00

643
00:40:07,552 --> 00:40:10,077
and we'll eat.

644
00:40:17,361 --> 00:40:20,353
One more thing.
Do you have a name,

645
00:40:20,431 --> 00:40:22,422
or should I just
keep calling you "miss"?

646
00:40:24,769 --> 00:40:27,260
Governor,
may I present...

647
00:40:27,338 --> 00:40:29,306
- Miss Alicia Larde.
- Miss Alicia Larde.

648
00:40:29,373 --> 00:40:32,365
- How do you do?
- Professor, please.
You and the governor.

649
00:40:35,446 --> 00:40:40,110
Wait, one second. I'm sorry.
I want a copy of this.

650
00:40:40,184 --> 00:40:42,311
First big date and all,
you know.

651
00:40:42,386 --> 00:40:45,446
So, you boys need
to look good.

652
00:40:47,024 --> 00:40:52,519
Which is not a state
you find yourselves in
altogether naturally.

653
00:40:54,932 --> 00:40:58,424
There. Better.

654
00:40:58,503 --> 00:41:01,734
- I'm surprising him.
- You just keep on surprising him.

655
00:41:01,806 --> 00:41:03,671
Professor.

656
00:41:20,324 --> 00:41:22,451
God must be a painter.

657
00:41:22,527 --> 00:41:25,860
Why else would we
have so many colors?

658
00:41:27,965 --> 00:41:30,331
So you're a painter?

659
00:41:30,902 --> 00:41:34,303
That's not actually
what I said,

660
00:41:34,372 --> 00:41:37,205
but, yes...

661
00:41:37,275 --> 00:41:39,743
I am.

662
00:41:47,318 --> 00:41:49,479
Here.

663
00:41:49,554 --> 00:41:51,454
Me.

664
00:41:51,522 --> 00:41:53,080
Your date?

665
00:41:54,792 --> 00:41:57,784
Practice human interaction
and social comportment.

666
00:41:57,862 --> 00:41:59,989
That's a plan.

667
00:42:03,601 --> 00:42:06,229
Champagne would be lovely.

668
00:42:07,605 --> 00:42:09,573
I'll be outside.

669
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:11,733
I will get the champagne.

670
00:42:20,351 --> 00:42:22,012
Oh, thank you.

671
00:42:23,254 --> 00:42:24,744
Thank you for that.

672
00:42:24,822 --> 00:42:27,154
No, keep it.

673
00:42:27,225 --> 00:42:30,285
I believe in deciding things
will be good luck.

674
00:42:30,361 --> 00:42:32,352
Do you?

675
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:34,364
No.

676
00:42:34,432 --> 00:42:36,423
I don't believe in luck.

677
00:42:40,771 --> 00:42:43,365
But I do believe
in assigning value to things.

678
00:42:44,375 --> 00:42:46,206
Oh.

679
00:42:53,651 --> 00:42:56,142
I once tried
to count them all.

680
00:42:57,154 --> 00:43:01,955
I actually made it to 4,348.

681
00:43:03,794 --> 00:43:06,422
You are exceptionally odd.

682
00:43:06,497 --> 00:43:09,364
I bet you're very
popular with the girls.

683
00:43:14,639 --> 00:43:17,130
A pair of odd ducks, then.

684
00:43:17,208 --> 00:43:19,802
Mmm.

685
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:24,409
Pick a shape.

686
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:27,445
What?

687
00:43:27,518 --> 00:43:31,750
Pick a shape.
An animal... anything.

688
00:43:33,090 --> 00:43:35,786
Okay.

689
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:38,385
An umbrella.

690
00:44:14,966 --> 00:44:16,831
Do it again.

691
00:44:16,901 --> 00:44:18,266
(Chuckles)

692
00:44:18,336 --> 00:44:19,928
- Do it again.
- All right.

693
00:44:20,004 --> 00:44:21,699
- What would you like?
- Do, uh...

694
00:44:21,772 --> 00:44:24,332
an octopus.

695
00:46:46,817 --> 00:46:49,547
(Dog Barking)

696
00:47:12,009 --> 00:47:13,909
(Alicia Chuckles)

697
00:47:13,978 --> 00:47:16,378
Alicia:
You don't talk much, do you?

698
00:47:16,447 --> 00:47:19,211
I can't talk to you
about my work, Alicia.

699
00:47:19,283 --> 00:47:21,114
I don't mean work.

700
00:47:26,257 --> 00:47:28,657
I find that polishing
my interactions

701
00:47:28,726 --> 00:47:31,752
in order to make them sociable
requires a tremendous effort.

702
00:47:33,430 --> 00:47:36,024
I have a tendency to expedite
information flow...

703
00:47:38,335 --> 00:47:40,667
by being direct.

704
00:47:42,006 --> 00:47:44,133
I often don't get
a pleasant result.

705
00:47:44,208 --> 00:47:45,505
Try me.

706
00:47:47,511 --> 00:47:49,240
All right.

707
00:47:52,816 --> 00:47:54,681
I find you attractive.

708
00:47:55,686 --> 00:47:57,881
Your aggressive
moves towards me

709
00:47:57,955 --> 00:47:59,752
indicate that you
feel the same way.

710
00:47:59,823 --> 00:48:02,621
But still,
ritual requires that we

711
00:48:02,693 --> 00:48:05,423
continue with a number
of platonic activities

712
00:48:05,496 --> 00:48:07,760
before we have sex.

713
00:48:07,831 --> 00:48:11,028
I am proceeding
with those activities,

714
00:48:11,101 --> 00:48:13,126
but in point of actual fact,

715
00:48:13,204 --> 00:48:17,300
all I really want to do
is have intercourse with you
as soon as possible.

716
00:48:19,443 --> 00:48:21,604
Are you gonna slap me now?

717
00:48:46,203 --> 00:48:48,296
How was that result?

718
00:49:05,723 --> 00:49:07,247
Girl:
What are you doing?

719
00:49:11,362 --> 00:49:14,354
I'm attempting to isolate
patterned re-occurrences

720
00:49:14,431 --> 00:49:17,059
within periodicals
over time... and you?

721
00:49:17,134 --> 00:49:19,364
You talk funny, Mr. Nash.

722
00:49:23,607 --> 00:49:25,541
Do I know you?

723
00:49:25,609 --> 00:49:29,705
My uncle says you're very smart
but not very nice,

724
00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:31,873
so I shouldn't pay no mind
if you're mean to me.

725
00:49:31,949 --> 00:49:33,974
And who might
your uncle be?

726
00:49:34,051 --> 00:49:36,485
The prodigal roommate...

727
00:49:36,553 --> 00:49:38,418
returns.

728
00:49:38,489 --> 00:49:40,184
(Chuckles)

729
00:49:41,892 --> 00:49:44,656
- Come here.
- Charles, Charles, Charles.

730
00:49:49,867 --> 00:49:51,960
My sister...

731
00:49:52,036 --> 00:49:54,402
got herself killed
in a car crash.

732
00:49:55,406 --> 00:49:57,067
Not too far now, Marcee!

733
00:49:58,175 --> 00:50:00,541
Her cowboy husband
was too drunk

734
00:50:00,611 --> 00:50:02,738
to know that he was
too drunk to drive.

735
00:50:02,813 --> 00:50:05,247
So, I took her in.

736
00:50:06,283 --> 00:50:09,912
- She's so small.
- She's young, John.
That's how they come.

737
00:50:12,089 --> 00:50:14,080
I'm at Harvard...

738
00:50:14,158 --> 00:50:16,820
doing the great
author's workshop.

739
00:50:16,894 --> 00:50:18,953
D.H. Bloody Lawrence.

740
00:50:19,029 --> 00:50:21,190
I really do think you should
buy yourself a new book.

741
00:50:21,265 --> 00:50:23,290
(Chuckles)

742
00:50:23,367 --> 00:50:26,461
Well, I've been reading
a lot about you.

743
00:50:27,471 --> 00:50:29,701
How are you, John?

744
00:50:29,773 --> 00:50:32,799
At first all my work
here was trivial,

745
00:50:32,876 --> 00:50:35,572
but a new assignment
came up and...

746
00:50:35,646 --> 00:50:38,638
I can't really tell you
any details.

747
00:50:38,716 --> 00:50:41,048
Top secret?
Black bag? Black ops?

748
00:50:41,118 --> 00:50:43,279
Something like that.

749
00:50:43,354 --> 00:50:47,051
- And, uh...
- yes?

750
00:50:47,124 --> 00:50:49,024
Well, l... I met a girl.

751
00:50:49,093 --> 00:50:52,028
- No! A human girl?
- Homo sapiens.

752
00:50:52,096 --> 00:50:54,291
- A biped?
- Yup. And contrary
to all probabilities,

753
00:50:54,365 --> 00:50:56,799
she finds me attractive
on a number of different levels.

754
00:50:56,867 --> 00:50:57,731
(Laughs)
Really?

755
00:50:57,801 --> 00:51:00,998
God, that's wonderful.

756
00:51:01,071 --> 00:51:03,938
There's no accounting
for taste, is there?

757
00:51:05,943 --> 00:51:08,070
Should I marry her?

758
00:51:08,145 --> 00:51:10,113
Oh, God. Right.

759
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:12,444
I mean, everything's
going well.

760
00:51:12,516 --> 00:51:15,110
The job is fine.
I have enough money.

761
00:51:15,185 --> 00:51:16,846
It all seems to add up.

762
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:19,855
But how do you know for sure?

763
00:51:21,759 --> 00:51:25,195
Nothing's ever for sure, John.

764
00:51:25,262 --> 00:51:27,355
That's the only
sure thing I do know.

765
00:51:34,371 --> 00:51:36,362
Waiter:
Good evening.

766
00:51:42,613 --> 00:51:45,081
Alicia, please don't be angry.

767
00:51:45,149 --> 00:51:46,707
I just lost track
of time at work...

768
00:51:47,785 --> 00:51:49,878
- again.
- Mm-hmm.

769
00:51:50,954 --> 00:51:52,444
I'm sorry.

770
00:51:53,590 --> 00:51:55,455
I didn't have time
to wrap it.

771
00:51:56,026 --> 00:51:58,017
Happy birthday.

772
00:52:02,299 --> 00:52:04,358
The refractive faces
of the glass, you see,

773
00:52:04,435 --> 00:52:06,232
they create
a full wavelength dispersal,

774
00:52:06,303 --> 00:52:08,328
so if you look inside it,
you can see...

775
00:52:08,405 --> 00:52:11,033
- Every possible color.
- Every possible color.

776
00:52:11,108 --> 00:52:12,336
Yeah.

777
00:52:12,409 --> 00:52:14,969
Remember you said that time
God must be a painter,

778
00:52:15,045 --> 00:52:17,843
because of all the colors?
At the governor's house...

779
00:52:17,915 --> 00:52:19,712
you said that.

780
00:52:19,783 --> 00:52:21,944
I didn't think
you were listening.

781
00:52:24,421 --> 00:52:26,514
I'm always listening.

782
00:52:32,796 --> 00:52:35,458
It's beautiful.

783
00:52:39,670 --> 00:52:41,467
(Chuckles)

784
00:52:51,215 --> 00:52:54,412
Alicia, does our
relationship warrant
long-term commitment?

785
00:52:54,485 --> 00:52:56,248
'Cause I need
some kind of proof,

786
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:58,550
some kind of verifiable,
empirical data.

787
00:53:02,226 --> 00:53:04,160
(Laughs)

788
00:53:04,228 --> 00:53:07,322
I'm sorry,
just give me a moment...

789
00:53:08,532 --> 00:53:11,865
to redefine
my girlish notions of romance.

790
00:53:15,138 --> 00:53:17,299
A proof?

791
00:53:17,374 --> 00:53:18,966
Verifiable data.

792
00:53:19,042 --> 00:53:21,738
Um... okay.

793
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:27,411
Well, how big
is the universe?

794
00:53:27,484 --> 00:53:29,076
Infinite.

795
00:53:29,152 --> 00:53:30,346
How do you know?

796
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:32,183
I know because
all the data indicate it.

797
00:53:32,256 --> 00:53:33,985
- But it hasn't been proven yet?
- No.

798
00:53:34,057 --> 00:53:35,922
You haven't seen it.
How do you know for sure?

799
00:53:35,993 --> 00:53:38,928
I don't, I just believe it.

800
00:53:38,996 --> 00:53:40,588
Mmm.

801
00:53:42,165 --> 00:53:44,429
It's the same
with love, I guess.

802
00:53:52,009 --> 00:53:53,636
Now,

803
00:53:53,710 --> 00:53:55,837
the part that
you don't know...

804
00:53:58,015 --> 00:54:00,848
is if I want
to marry you.

805
00:54:14,865 --> 00:54:17,493
(Applause)

806
00:54:21,738 --> 00:54:24,002
Smile for the camera!

807
00:54:27,144 --> 00:54:28,668
Well done!

808
00:54:28,745 --> 00:54:30,679
Oh, sweet pea.

809
00:54:30,747 --> 00:54:32,408
- I love you.
- Congratulations.

810
00:54:32,482 --> 00:54:34,245
Hey, Sol.

811
00:54:34,318 --> 00:54:36,616
Woman.
You look beautiful.

812
00:54:37,621 --> 00:54:38,883
Sol:
Hi, how are you?

813
00:54:43,594 --> 00:54:45,824
Alicia:
Hey, Sol.

814
00:54:45,896 --> 00:54:47,864
- Woman: Bye-bye.
- Man: Bye, now.

815
00:54:47,931 --> 00:54:49,922
- Bye!
- Bye!

816
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,627
Be safe!

817
00:54:59,176 --> 00:55:01,201
(Gate Opens)

818
00:55:02,045 --> 00:55:05,071
Cambridge, MA
October 1 954

819
00:55:20,797 --> 00:55:22,628
Get In. Hurry.

820
00:55:26,069 --> 00:55:29,004
They're following us.

821
00:55:32,576 --> 00:55:34,100
Who's...
Who's following us?

822
00:55:34,177 --> 00:55:35,804
The drop's been
compromised.

823
00:55:35,879 --> 00:55:37,813
- (Gunfire)
- Parcher. Get down!

824
00:55:38,815 --> 00:55:40,942
- Stay down.
- (Horn Honks)

825
00:55:45,555 --> 00:55:48,820
- (Pants)
- (Horn Honking)

826
00:56:00,604 --> 00:56:03,164
(Gun Firing)

827
00:56:08,111 --> 00:56:10,909
- Here, take this.
- I ain't shooting anybody.

828
00:56:10,981 --> 00:56:13,643
- Take the goddamn gun!
- No!

829
00:56:13,717 --> 00:56:15,309
Son of a...

830
00:56:15,385 --> 00:56:17,250
(Screams)

831
00:56:31,968 --> 00:56:34,095
You stay back.
Don't move.

832
00:56:39,476 --> 00:56:41,205
(Screams)

833
00:56:44,081 --> 00:56:45,878
(Tires Screeching)

834
00:57:20,917 --> 00:57:23,317
Alicia. John?

835
00:57:29,459 --> 00:57:30,983
Hi.

836
00:57:33,396 --> 00:57:35,125
Where were you?

837
00:57:38,235 --> 00:57:41,033
- S-Sol...
- Yeah, I talked to Sol.

838
00:57:41,104 --> 00:57:43,732
He said you left
the office hours ago.

839
00:57:46,243 --> 00:57:48,803
Why didn't you call me?

840
00:57:53,150 --> 00:57:54,845
Are you all right?

841
00:58:04,194 --> 00:58:05,821
Honey?

842
00:58:05,896 --> 00:58:07,625
(Bolt Locking)

843
00:58:07,697 --> 00:58:08,823
John...

844
00:58:08,899 --> 00:58:12,164
Please, talk to me.
Tell me what happened.

845
00:58:13,236 --> 00:58:15,534
John, open the door.

846
00:58:17,207 --> 00:58:20,176
Come on, open the door!
Let me in!

847
00:58:20,243 --> 00:58:22,211
Talk to me!

848
00:58:23,213 --> 00:58:24,771
John!

849
00:58:24,848 --> 00:58:27,942
Open the door!

850
00:58:29,886 --> 00:58:32,354
(Panting)

851
00:58:44,568 --> 00:58:46,832
Woman:
Watch for cars, kids.

852
00:59:06,590 --> 00:59:08,854
(Door Opens, Closes)

853
00:59:28,812 --> 00:59:30,837
John.

854
00:59:30,914 --> 00:59:33,348
William.

855
00:59:33,416 --> 00:59:35,714
This is not what
I signed on for.

856
00:59:35,785 --> 00:59:37,810
Every time a car backfires
or a door slams...

857
00:59:37,888 --> 00:59:41,688
I understand... better than you
could possibly imagine.

858
00:59:51,401 --> 00:59:53,926
You need to calm down, John.

859
00:59:54,004 --> 00:59:56,632
Now listen to me.
We're closing in on the bomb,

860
00:59:56,706 --> 00:59:59,038
in large part
due to your work.

861
00:59:59,109 --> 01:00:01,771
Now don't you think your fear
is a small price to pay?

862
01:00:01,845 --> 01:00:04,678
William, my circumstance
has changed.

863
01:00:04,748 --> 01:00:07,080
Alicia's pregnant.

864
01:00:15,358 --> 01:00:18,418
I told you attachments
were dangerous.

865
01:00:18,495 --> 01:00:21,521
You chose to marry the girl.

866
01:00:21,598 --> 01:00:24,158
I did nothing
to prevent it.

867
01:00:26,870 --> 01:00:29,361
The best way to ensure
everybody's safety

868
01:00:29,439 --> 01:00:31,634
is for you to continue
your work.

869
01:00:32,642 --> 01:00:34,234
Well, I'll just quit.

870
01:00:34,311 --> 01:00:36,108
You won't.

871
01:00:36,179 --> 01:00:37,612
Why would I not?

872
01:00:37,681 --> 01:00:41,014
Because I keep the Russians
from knowing you work for us.

873
01:00:42,018 --> 01:00:43,781
You quit working for me,

874
01:00:43,853 --> 01:00:46,583
I quit working for you.

875
01:00:59,202 --> 01:01:00,794
Parcher!

876
01:01:00,870 --> 01:01:02,394
Parcher!

877
01:01:06,843 --> 01:01:09,004
John, you all right?

878
01:01:29,699 --> 01:01:31,132
John?

879
01:01:31,201 --> 01:01:32,828
Turn it off!
Turn off the light!

880
01:01:36,606 --> 01:01:38,267
Why would you do that?

881
01:01:38,341 --> 01:01:39,968
Why would you
turn the light on?

882
01:01:40,043 --> 01:01:41,533
What is wrong with you?

883
01:01:41,611 --> 01:01:43,511
You have to go
to your sister's.

884
01:01:44,848 --> 01:01:47,112
I left the car out the back.
You take Commonwealth.

885
01:01:47,183 --> 01:01:50,414
- No side streets,
you stay where it's crowded.
- John, I'm not going anywhere!

886
01:01:50,487 --> 01:01:52,853
When you get to your sister's,
you wait for me to call you.

887
01:01:52,922 --> 01:01:55,015
- No, I'm not going.
- Just get your things.

888
01:01:55,091 --> 01:01:57,651
- I'm not leaving...
- stop! Stop it!

889
01:01:57,727 --> 01:02:00,321
Please, Alicia.

890
01:02:00,397 --> 01:02:03,696
I'll explain when I can.

891
01:02:42,839 --> 01:02:46,707
Harvard University
National Mathematics Conference

892
01:02:50,113 --> 01:02:52,047
Marcee.
UncleJohn!

893
01:02:52,115 --> 01:02:54,208
UncleJohn!

894
01:02:54,284 --> 01:02:56,377
(Growls)

895
01:02:56,453 --> 01:02:59,911
- Hey, baby girl!
- (Marcee Laughing)

896
01:02:59,989 --> 01:03:02,753
Wow, someone
needed a hug!

897
01:03:02,826 --> 01:03:05,454
I saw you on the slate
and I thought to myself,

898
01:03:05,528 --> 01:03:07,723
"How can I miss seeing
a guest lecture

899
01:03:07,797 --> 01:03:09,992
by the inimitable
John Nash"?

900
01:03:13,136 --> 01:03:14,933
What's wrong?

901
01:03:15,004 --> 01:03:20,135
I got myself into something.
I think I might need some help.

902
01:03:20,210 --> 01:03:22,041
Well, now you tell me,
what is it?

903
01:03:22,112 --> 01:03:24,307
Woman.
Professor Nash!

904
01:03:24,380 --> 01:03:26,644
Welcome!

905
01:03:28,351 --> 01:03:30,148
After?

906
01:03:35,758 --> 01:03:39,888
John:
So, we see that
the... the zeroes,

907
01:03:39,963 --> 01:03:42,557
of the Reimann
zeta function,

908
01:03:42,632 --> 01:03:45,362
correspond
to singularities

909
01:03:45,435 --> 01:03:48,632
in space-time,

910
01:03:48,705 --> 01:03:51,640
singularities
in space-time...

911
01:03:54,511 --> 01:03:57,412
And conventional
number theory...

912
01:03:59,349 --> 01:04:03,877
it breaks down in the face
of relativistic exploration.

913
01:04:19,235 --> 01:04:21,294
Sometimes our expectations

914
01:04:21,371 --> 01:04:23,805
are betrayed
by the numbers.

915
01:04:23,873 --> 01:04:26,933
Variables are impossible
to assign any...

916
01:04:27,010 --> 01:04:29,570
rational value.

917
01:04:49,432 --> 01:04:51,559
Professor Nash!

918
01:05:01,277 --> 01:05:03,939
- Hold it!
- Professor Nash?

919
01:05:05,882 --> 01:05:08,146
Professor Nash,

920
01:05:08,218 --> 01:05:11,654
let's avoid a scene,
shall we?

921
01:05:11,721 --> 01:05:13,712
What do you want?

922
01:05:13,790 --> 01:05:16,384
My name is Rosen,

923
01:05:16,459 --> 01:05:18,484
Dr. Rosen.
I'm a psychiatrist.

924
01:05:18,561 --> 01:05:21,655
Forgive me
if I don't seem persuaded.

925
01:05:21,731 --> 01:05:24,393
I'd like you
to come with me, John.

926
01:05:25,401 --> 01:05:27,335
Just for a chat.

927
01:05:28,404 --> 01:05:30,429
It appears I have no choice.

928
01:05:33,576 --> 01:05:35,043
Oh-hh!

929
01:05:41,985 --> 01:05:43,714
Help me! Somebody!

930
01:05:47,724 --> 01:05:49,282
(Screams)
Somebody!

931
01:05:49,359 --> 01:05:52,760
Help me!
Get off me!

932
01:05:52,829 --> 01:05:55,195
I know who you are!
I know who you are!

933
01:05:55,265 --> 01:05:56,892
No, no, no,
no, don't.

934
01:05:56,966 --> 01:05:58,866
Charles, they're Russians!
Charles, they're Russians!

935
01:05:58,935 --> 01:06:00,732
Call somebody!
Call somebody, Charles!

936
01:06:00,803 --> 01:06:02,293
- They're Russians!
- Steady the leg.

937
01:06:02,372 --> 01:06:04,135
Get away from me.

938
01:06:04,207 --> 01:06:06,471
Stay away from me!

939
01:06:11,347 --> 01:06:13,872
Dr. Rosen.
There, now.

940
01:06:13,950 --> 01:06:15,781
All better.

941
01:06:19,389 --> 01:06:21,687
- Everything's all right here.
- (Gasps)

942
01:06:23,493 --> 01:06:25,586
Watch your head.

943
01:06:55,658 --> 01:06:58,024
(Dr. Rosen, Faintly)
John?

944
01:06:59,028 --> 01:07:01,087
Can you hear me?

945
01:07:09,706 --> 01:07:12,231
(Faint Whispering)

946
01:07:14,444 --> 01:07:16,844
Go easy now.

947
01:07:16,913 --> 01:07:19,882
Thorazine takes
a little while to wear off.

948
01:07:22,952 --> 01:07:25,216
Sorry about
the restraints.

949
01:07:25,288 --> 01:07:27,813
You've got one hell
of a right hook.

950
01:07:28,391 --> 01:07:31,053
(Weakly)
Where am I?

951
01:07:31,127 --> 01:07:32,788
Ahem.

952
01:07:32,862 --> 01:07:35,228
Macarthur Psychiatric Hospital.

953
01:07:38,134 --> 01:07:41,001
I find that highly unlikely.

954
01:07:41,070 --> 01:07:42,594
You made a mistake.

955
01:07:42,672 --> 01:07:46,574
My work is non-military
in application.

956
01:07:46,642 --> 01:07:49,133
Which work is that, John?

957
01:07:51,247 --> 01:07:53,044
I don't know anything.

958
01:07:53,116 --> 01:07:55,744
(Laughs)
There's no good
in keeping secrets, you know.

959
01:07:58,087 --> 01:08:00,214
(Groans)

960
01:08:03,926 --> 01:08:06,156
(Buzzer)

961
01:08:11,934 --> 01:08:14,198
Charles?

962
01:08:15,605 --> 01:08:17,163
Charles?

963
01:08:18,908 --> 01:08:20,842
I didn't mean to get you
involved in this.

964
01:08:23,146 --> 01:08:25,046
I'm... I'm sorry.

965
01:08:29,385 --> 01:08:31,751
Charles...?

966
01:08:37,593 --> 01:08:40,357
The prodigal roommate
revealed.

967
01:08:43,766 --> 01:08:46,394
"Saw my name
on the lecture slate"?

968
01:08:46,469 --> 01:08:48,630
You lying son of a bitch!

969
01:08:48,704 --> 01:08:51,400
Who are you talking to?
Tell me who you see.

970
01:08:51,474 --> 01:08:54,068
How do you say,
"Charles Herman" in Russian?

971
01:08:54,143 --> 01:08:56,668
How do you say it
in Russian?

972
01:08:56,746 --> 01:09:00,045
There's no one there, John.
There's no one there.

973
01:09:00,116 --> 01:09:02,676
He's right there.
He's right there.

974
01:09:02,752 --> 01:09:05,846
Stop!
I don't know anything!

975
01:09:05,922 --> 01:09:08,584
Stop! l... I don't know anything!

976
01:09:11,027 --> 01:09:12,790
My name is John Nash.

977
01:09:12,862 --> 01:09:14,523
I'm being held
against my will.

978
01:09:14,597 --> 01:09:17,157
Somebody call
the Department of Defense.

979
01:09:17,233 --> 01:09:18,962
My name is John Nash.

980
01:09:19,035 --> 01:09:21,560
I'm being held
against my will!

981
01:09:26,609 --> 01:09:29,100
Alicia.
What's wrong with him?

982
01:09:31,781 --> 01:09:34,045
John has schizophrenia.

983
01:09:34,116 --> 01:09:37,882
People with this disorder
are often paranoid.

984
01:09:39,789 --> 01:09:43,316
But... But his work.

985
01:09:43,392 --> 01:09:45,656
He deals with conspiracies...

986
01:09:46,662 --> 01:09:48,926
Yes, yes, I know.

987
01:09:48,998 --> 01:09:53,128
In John's world, these behaviors
are... accepted,

988
01:09:53,202 --> 01:09:54,829
encouraged.

989
01:09:54,904 --> 01:09:58,340
As such, his illness
may have gone untreated

990
01:09:58,407 --> 01:10:00,238
far longer than is typical.

991
01:10:01,310 --> 01:10:02,868
What do you mean?
How long?

992
01:10:02,945 --> 01:10:05,004
Possibly since
graduate school?

993
01:10:05,081 --> 01:10:08,346
At least that's when
his hallucinations
seem to have begun.

994
01:10:08,417 --> 01:10:10,783
What are you talking about?
What hallucinations?

995
01:10:10,853 --> 01:10:13,083
One, so far,
that I am aware of.

996
01:10:13,155 --> 01:10:16,522
An imaginary roommate
named Charles Herman.

997
01:10:16,592 --> 01:10:20,050
Charles isn't imaginary.

998
01:10:20,129 --> 01:10:22,723
He and John have been
best friends since Princeton.

999
01:10:22,798 --> 01:10:25,767
Have you ever met Charles?
Has he ever come to dinner?

1000
01:10:25,835 --> 01:10:28,702
He's always in town
for so little time, lecturing.

1001
01:10:28,771 --> 01:10:31,604
- Was he at your wedding?
- He had to teach.

1002
01:10:31,674 --> 01:10:33,232
Have you ever
seen a picture of him,

1003
01:10:33,309 --> 01:10:35,937
- talked to him
on the telephone?
- This is ridiculous.

1004
01:10:36,012 --> 01:10:38,173
I phoned Princeton.

1005
01:10:38,247 --> 01:10:40,112
According to their
housing records,

1006
01:10:40,182 --> 01:10:42,082
John lived alone.

1007
01:10:44,954 --> 01:10:48,390
Now, which is more likely...
that your husband,

1008
01:10:48,457 --> 01:10:50,755
a mathematician
with no military training,

1009
01:10:50,826 --> 01:10:53,260
is a government spy
fleeing the Russians...

1010
01:10:53,329 --> 01:10:54,990
You're making him sound crazy.

1011
01:10:55,064 --> 01:10:58,295
...Or, that he has
lost his grip on reality?

1012
01:11:00,736 --> 01:11:02,397
Now the only way
I can help him

1013
01:11:02,471 --> 01:11:03,836
is to show him
the difference

1014
01:11:03,906 --> 01:11:06,670
between what's real

1015
01:11:06,742 --> 01:11:08,903
and what is in his mind.

1016
01:11:11,547 --> 01:11:13,481
Come on.

1017
01:11:15,151 --> 01:11:17,415
What's he been working on?

1018
01:11:17,486 --> 01:11:20,421
His work is classified.

1019
01:11:20,489 --> 01:11:22,753
He mentioned a supervisor

1020
01:11:22,825 --> 01:11:25,350
by the name
of William Parcher.

1021
01:11:25,428 --> 01:11:28,420
Maybe Mr. Parcher
can clarify things for us.

1022
01:11:28,497 --> 01:11:30,965
But I can't get to him
without clearances.

1023
01:11:32,034 --> 01:11:33,524
You want me to help you get

1024
01:11:33,603 --> 01:11:35,594
the details of my husband's work?

1025
01:11:35,671 --> 01:11:39,129
John thinks I'm a Russian spy.

1026
01:11:39,208 --> 01:11:41,176
Is that what you think?

1027
01:11:45,881 --> 01:11:48,315
- What did the doctor say?
- Is he sick?

1028
01:11:48,384 --> 01:11:50,011
I don't know.

1029
01:11:50,086 --> 01:11:51,815
I want to see whatJohn's
been working on.

1030
01:11:51,887 --> 01:11:54,947
- You know you can't
go in his office.
- It's classified, Alicia.

1031
01:11:55,024 --> 01:11:56,514
Stop. Oh!

1032
01:12:09,972 --> 01:12:12,270
Oh, my God.

1033
01:12:16,345 --> 01:12:18,313
Oh, my God.

1034
01:12:25,254 --> 01:12:28,223
Why didn't you
say something?

1035
01:12:28,290 --> 01:12:31,316
Alicia, John's always been

1036
01:12:31,394 --> 01:12:33,760
a little weird.

1037
01:12:33,829 --> 01:12:35,990
He said he was
doing code-breaking,

1038
01:12:36,065 --> 01:12:38,260
that it was eyes-only.

1039
01:12:38,334 --> 01:12:41,303
- Top secret, part
of the military effort.
- Was he?

1040
01:12:41,370 --> 01:12:43,838
Well, it was possible,
you know?

1041
01:12:43,906 --> 01:12:45,339
Directives come down
all the time

1042
01:12:45,408 --> 01:12:46,807
that some of us
aren't cleared for.

1043
01:12:46,876 --> 01:12:49,344
- It was possible.
- Possible, but...

1044
01:12:49,412 --> 01:12:51,243
not likely.

1045
01:12:52,948 --> 01:12:55,712
Lately, he'd become
so much more agitated

1046
01:12:55,785 --> 01:12:57,946
and then when you called...

1047
01:12:58,020 --> 01:13:00,614
So, is this all
he's been doing every day?

1048
01:13:00,690 --> 01:13:03,022
Cutting out magazines?

1049
01:13:04,627 --> 01:13:07,289
Well, not all.

1050
01:14:07,857 --> 01:14:10,257
(Door Opens)

1051
01:14:28,511 --> 01:14:31,969
- Alicia: I'm so sorry.
- John: It's okay.

1052
01:14:35,251 --> 01:14:37,242
- I missed you.
- I missed you.

1053
01:14:39,655 --> 01:14:41,589
I have to talk to you.

1054
01:14:41,657 --> 01:14:43,750
Okay.

1055
01:14:48,397 --> 01:14:51,025
Alicia, I've been
thinking about it,

1056
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:54,695
and I do realize
that my behavior

1057
01:14:54,770 --> 01:14:57,864
and my inability to discuss
the situation with you

1058
01:14:57,940 --> 01:15:00,374
must have appeared insane.

1059
01:15:00,442 --> 01:15:02,603
I left you with no other choice.

1060
01:15:02,678 --> 01:15:04,873
I do understand...

1061
01:15:04,947 --> 01:15:07,848
- and I'm truly sorry.
- That's okay.

1062
01:15:09,185 --> 01:15:11,449
Everything's gonna be all right.

1063
01:15:12,955 --> 01:15:15,116
Everything's gonna be all right.

1064
01:15:16,158 --> 01:15:18,126
We just have to talk quietly.

1065
01:15:19,361 --> 01:15:23,821
They may be listening.
There may be microphones.

1066
01:15:23,899 --> 01:15:26,493
I'm gonna tell you
everything now.

1067
01:15:26,569 --> 01:15:29,003
It's breaking with protocol

1068
01:15:29,071 --> 01:15:31,005
but you need to know,

1069
01:15:31,073 --> 01:15:34,975
because you have to help me
get out of here.

1070
01:15:36,345 --> 01:15:39,678
I've been doing top-secret work
for the government.

1071
01:15:39,748 --> 01:15:41,477
There's a threat that exists

1072
01:15:41,550 --> 01:15:44,246
of catastrophic proportions.

1073
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:47,153
I think the Russians
feel my profile is too high.

1074
01:15:47,223 --> 01:15:49,623
That's why they simply
just don't do away with me.

1075
01:15:49,692 --> 01:15:51,990
They're keeping me here
to try to stop me

1076
01:15:52,061 --> 01:15:54,393
from doing my work.
You have to get to Wheeler.

1077
01:15:54,463 --> 01:15:56,522
- You have to find
William Parcher.
- Stop.

1078
01:15:56,599 --> 01:15:59,534
- He can help us.
- Stop. Stop. Stop!

1079
01:16:04,306 --> 01:16:06,069
I went to Wheeler.

1080
01:16:06,141 --> 01:16:07,802
Good, good.

1081
01:16:07,877 --> 01:16:09,936
There is no William Parcher.

1082
01:16:11,347 --> 01:16:12,371
Of course there is.

1083
01:16:12,414 --> 01:16:14,348
- I've been working for him.
- Doing what?

1084
01:16:14,416 --> 01:16:16,577
Breaking codes?

1085
01:16:16,652 --> 01:16:18,745
Dropping packages
in a secret mailbox

1086
01:16:18,821 --> 01:16:20,755
for the government to pick up?

1087
01:16:22,358 --> 01:16:24,121
How could you know that?

1088
01:16:24,193 --> 01:16:26,320
Sol followed you.

1089
01:16:26,896 --> 01:16:29,865
- He thought it was harmless.
- Sol followed me?

1090
01:16:38,941 --> 01:16:41,569
They've never been opened.

1091
01:16:44,246 --> 01:16:46,942
It isn't real.

1092
01:16:47,016 --> 01:16:50,247
There is no conspiracy, John.

1093
01:16:52,588 --> 01:16:55,421
There is no William Parcher.

1094
01:16:56,492 --> 01:16:58,926
It's in your mind.

1095
01:17:00,496 --> 01:17:04,091
Do you understand, baby?

1096
01:17:04,166 --> 01:17:06,862
You're sick.

1097
01:17:09,772 --> 01:17:12,070
You're sick, John.

1098
01:17:12,141 --> 01:17:13,802
John?!

1099
01:17:13,876 --> 01:17:15,810
John!

1100
01:17:24,119 --> 01:17:25,643
Code red.

1101
01:17:25,721 --> 01:17:28,281
(Over P.A.)
Dr. Rosen, code red.
Observation room two.

1102
01:17:28,357 --> 01:17:31,986
Dr. Rosen, code red.
Observation room two.

1103
01:17:37,599 --> 01:17:39,430
(Keys Jingling)

1104
01:17:43,072 --> 01:17:45,267
John?

1105
01:17:46,942 --> 01:17:48,807
John?

1106
01:17:50,746 --> 01:17:53,078
The implant's gone.

1107
01:17:53,649 --> 01:17:56,117
I can't find it.

1108
01:17:59,688 --> 01:18:01,952
It's gone.

1109
01:18:33,122 --> 01:18:36,216
Dr. Rosen.
You see, the nightmare
of schizophrenia

1110
01:18:36,291 --> 01:18:38,623
is not knowing what's true.

1111
01:18:39,194 --> 01:18:41,162
Imagine...

1112
01:18:41,230 --> 01:18:44,427
if you had suddenly learned
that the people and the places

1113
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:47,469
and the moments
most important to you

1114
01:18:47,536 --> 01:18:50,004
were not gone, not dead,

1115
01:18:50,072 --> 01:18:52,597
but worse...

1116
01:18:52,674 --> 01:18:54,608
Had never been.

1117
01:18:57,179 --> 01:19:00,114
What kind of hell
would that be?

1118
01:19:05,220 --> 01:19:07,245
Administering insulin.

1119
01:19:08,257 --> 01:19:10,555
Man.
8.42 am.

1120
01:20:08,283 --> 01:20:10,444
How often?

1121
01:20:11,987 --> 01:20:14,956
Five times a week
for 1 0 weeks.

1122
01:20:35,644 --> 01:20:38,044
Princeton University
1 Year Later

1123
01:20:38,113 --> 01:20:41,708
Alicia.
John always spoke so fondly
of being here at Princeton.

1124
01:20:41,783 --> 01:20:44,479
And Hansen is running
the department now.

1125
01:20:44,553 --> 01:20:46,248
So he keeps reminding us,
and reminding us.

1126
01:20:46,321 --> 01:20:48,221
(Laughs)

1127
01:20:48,290 --> 01:20:49,655
Yeah.

1128
01:20:49,725 --> 01:20:51,955
John won't come near
the campus, though.

1129
01:20:52,027 --> 01:20:54,962
- I think he's ashamed.
- (Baby Cries)

1130
01:20:55,030 --> 01:20:58,022
Hey. Hey.

1131
01:20:58,100 --> 01:21:00,227
Want this?

1132
01:21:00,302 --> 01:21:03,931
So, Alicia, how...
how are you holding up?

1133
01:21:04,006 --> 01:21:06,770
Well, the delusions have passed.

1134
01:21:06,842 --> 01:21:09,106
They're saying
with the medication

1135
01:21:09,178 --> 01:21:10,770
and low stress environment...

1136
01:21:10,846 --> 01:21:13,644
No, l... I mean,
how are you?

1137
01:21:20,923 --> 01:21:23,153
I think often what I feel

1138
01:21:23,225 --> 01:21:26,490
is obligation.

1139
01:21:28,564 --> 01:21:31,863
Or guilt over wanting to leave.

1140
01:21:32,901 --> 01:21:37,395
Rage againstJohn,
against God and...

1141
01:21:39,441 --> 01:21:40,772
But...

1142
01:21:43,812 --> 01:21:46,007
then I look at him

1143
01:21:47,282 --> 01:21:51,844
and I force myself to see
the man that I married.

1144
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:54,718
And he becomes that man.

1145
01:21:54,790 --> 01:21:59,227
He's transformed
into someone that I love.

1146
01:22:01,196 --> 01:22:04,723
And I'm transformed
into someone who loves him.

1147
01:22:07,603 --> 01:22:09,594
It's not all the time,

1148
01:22:09,671 --> 01:22:12,504
but...

1149
01:22:12,574 --> 01:22:14,303
it's enough.

1150
01:22:14,376 --> 01:22:17,345
I thinkJohn is
a very lucky man...

1151
01:22:17,412 --> 01:22:19,073
Alicia.

1152
01:22:23,652 --> 01:22:26,416
So unlucky.

1153
01:22:29,424 --> 01:22:31,517
- Alicia: This is us.
- Sol: This is it?

1154
01:22:31,593 --> 01:22:34,255
- It's nice.
- It's near where I work.

1155
01:22:34,329 --> 01:22:36,854
Alicia.
John? You've a visitor.

1156
01:22:39,501 --> 01:22:41,469
Hi.

1157
01:22:41,536 --> 01:22:43,128
Hi.

1158
01:22:43,205 --> 01:22:45,070
I hope it's okay.

1159
01:22:52,514 --> 01:22:54,072
Hey ya, chief.

1160
01:22:55,817 --> 01:22:58,149
- Cigarette?
- Ah, no, thanks.

1161
01:22:58,220 --> 01:23:00,313
I quit, actually.

1162
01:23:03,959 --> 01:23:06,291
- Hello.
- Hey, John.

1163
01:23:08,630 --> 01:23:10,188
Have you met Harvey?

1164
01:23:10,265 --> 01:23:11,698
Umm, I...

1165
01:23:11,767 --> 01:23:12,995
(Laughs)

1166
01:23:13,068 --> 01:23:14,933
- John, there's no...
- Relax, it's okay.

1167
01:23:15,003 --> 01:23:17,665
There's no point
in being nuts if you can't
have a little fun.

1168
01:23:17,739 --> 01:23:19,730
Jesus Christ, John.
(Laughs)

1169
01:23:19,808 --> 01:23:21,435
I should have known.

1170
01:23:22,911 --> 01:23:24,776
Here you go.

1171
01:23:26,315 --> 01:23:28,249
I can take those later.

1172
01:23:28,317 --> 01:23:29,875
You're supposed
to take them now.

1173
01:23:31,186 --> 01:23:34,587
- Can I bring you something?
- I'm okay.

1174
01:23:34,656 --> 01:23:36,180
Okay.

1175
01:23:39,027 --> 01:23:41,689
So, um... yeah.
l... I was in town

1176
01:23:41,763 --> 01:23:43,924
giving a workshop.

1177
01:23:43,999 --> 01:23:45,967
I go back tonight.

1178
01:23:46,034 --> 01:23:48,298
You know, Bender,
he really wanted

1179
01:23:48,370 --> 01:23:52,932
to stop by and you know, see you.
You know, say hi.

1180
01:23:53,008 --> 01:23:54,635
Squeamish?

1181
01:23:54,710 --> 01:23:57,144
Yeah.

1182
01:23:57,212 --> 01:23:59,703
I suppose I would be, too.

1183
01:23:59,781 --> 01:24:01,772
But alas, I'm stuck with me.

1184
01:24:05,220 --> 01:24:08,451
- I'm trying to solve
the Reimann Hypothesis.
- Uh-huh.

1185
01:24:09,958 --> 01:24:11,926
Oh, yeah?

1186
01:24:11,993 --> 01:24:15,121
I figured if...
if I dazzle them,

1187
01:24:15,197 --> 01:24:17,392
they will have
to reinstate me.

1188
01:24:18,900 --> 01:24:22,461
But it's difficult
with the medication,

1189
01:24:22,537 --> 01:24:25,973
because it's hard to...

1190
01:24:26,041 --> 01:24:29,602
see the solution.

1191
01:24:38,086 --> 01:24:40,884
You know, John,
you should go easy.

1192
01:24:40,956 --> 01:24:43,982
There are other
things besides...

1193
01:24:44,059 --> 01:24:45,356
Besides work.

1194
01:24:47,763 --> 01:24:49,890
What are they?

1195
01:24:52,334 --> 01:24:55,303
(Baby Crying)

1196
01:25:07,816 --> 01:25:09,841
Shh-hh.

1197
01:25:10,852 --> 01:25:12,820
Shh.

1198
01:25:18,059 --> 01:25:19,856
(Door Closes)

1199
01:25:25,901 --> 01:25:27,892
What are you
thinking about?

1200
01:25:31,072 --> 01:25:33,006
What do people do?

1201
01:25:33,074 --> 01:25:35,508
It's life, John.

1202
01:25:35,577 --> 01:25:37,545
Activities available,

1203
01:25:37,612 --> 01:25:40,206
just add meaning.

1204
01:25:47,622 --> 01:25:49,749
You could try
leaving the house.

1205
01:25:49,825 --> 01:25:53,261
You know, maybe...

1206
01:25:53,328 --> 01:25:55,489
talk to people.

1207
01:26:00,101 --> 01:26:02,433
You could try
taking out the garbage.

1208
01:26:18,053 --> 01:26:20,385
(Muffled Voice)

1209
01:26:24,559 --> 01:26:27,221
John.
And there's some more...
there's some more in...

1210
01:26:27,295 --> 01:26:29,320
(Muffled)

1211
01:26:39,608 --> 01:26:42,008
Who... Who were
you talking to?

1212
01:26:42,077 --> 01:26:44,204
Garbage man.

1213
01:26:53,488 --> 01:26:56,048
Garbage men don't come at night.

1214
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:00,819
I guess around here they do.

1215
01:27:03,865 --> 01:27:05,696
(Man Whistles)

1216
01:27:05,767 --> 01:27:08,759
(Truck Approaching)

1217
01:27:20,949 --> 01:27:22,974
(Giggles)

1218
01:27:27,088 --> 01:27:29,249
Sorry.

1219
01:28:35,223 --> 01:28:37,919
Alicia. Is it
the medication?

1220
01:28:48,670 --> 01:28:51,161
(Door Closes)

1221
01:29:08,356 --> 01:29:10,916
(Screams)

1222
01:29:11,926 --> 01:29:14,360
(Screams)

1223
01:29:18,366 --> 01:29:20,834
(Sobs)
I don't know what to do.

1224
01:29:25,840 --> 01:29:28,536
(Sobbing Continues)

1225
01:29:36,051 --> 01:29:38,519
(Car Door Opens)

1226
01:29:38,586 --> 01:29:41,521
My mother's
going to keep the baby
a little longer tonight.

1227
01:29:42,724 --> 01:29:44,919
I can get three hours
of overtime.

1228
01:30:00,742 --> 01:30:02,733
(Faint Music Playing)

1229
01:30:10,919 --> 01:30:12,944
I'm going to bed.

1230
01:30:19,594 --> 01:30:22,586
- Good night.
- Good night.

1231
01:31:05,306 --> 01:31:07,570
(Clattering)

1232
01:31:39,340 --> 01:31:40,568
(Gun Cocks)

1233
01:31:40,642 --> 01:31:43,202
Parcher.
It's good to see you, John.

1234
01:31:44,345 --> 01:31:46,370
It's been a while.

1235
01:31:47,115 --> 01:31:48,412
Parcher?

1236
01:31:48,983 --> 01:31:50,575
Yes, sir.

1237
01:31:54,055 --> 01:31:55,579
You're not real!

1238
01:31:55,657 --> 01:31:58,421
Of course I am.
Don't be ridiculous.

1239
01:32:01,262 --> 01:32:02,889

01:32:02,964 --> 01:32:05,455
I don't think that I would
go that way, John.

1241
01:32:06,968 --> 01:32:09,300
It's time for you
to get back to work.

1242
01:32:09,370 --> 01:32:12,396
Parcher.
The bomb is in
its final position

1243

here in the U.S.

1244
01:32:15,310 --> 01:32:16,504
Knowing your situation

1245
01:32:16,544 --> 01:32:19,911
requires you keep
a low profile, "Mohammed,"

1246

the mountain to you.

(Radio Signals)

1249
01:32:42,103 --> 01:32:46,767
We've narrowed the bomb's
location to somewhere
on the eastern seaboard.

1250
01:32:46,841 --> 01:32:51,471
But we haven't been able
to pinpoint its exact position.

1251
01:32:53,781 --> 01:32:56,443
Their codes have grown
increasingly complex.

1252
01:32:59,120 --> 01:33:01,350
Here, look at this, John.

1253
01:33:03,825 --> 01:33:05,554
What?

1254
01:33:05,627 --> 01:33:07,026
What?

- Rosen! That quack!

"Schizophrenic break
from reality," right?

1257

Psychological bullshit!

1258
01:33:17,338 --> 01:33:19,329
Look at me, John.

1259
01:33:19,908 --> 01:33:21,808
John, look at me.

1260
01:33:23,578 --> 01:33:25,569
Do I look like I'm imagined?

1261
01:33:27,949 --> 01:33:30,008
Wheeler has no record of you.

1262
01:33:30,084 --> 01:33:32,552

our personnel?

1263
01:33:34,689 --> 01:33:37,852
John, I'm sorry you had
to go through all this.

1264
01:33:38,426 --> 01:33:41,361
I've gone to a great deal
of trouble to get you back.

1265
01:33:41,429 --> 01:33:44,159
I can restore
your status at Wheeler.

1266
01:33:44,232 --> 01:33:46,894
I can let the world
know what you did.

1267

He's been injected
with a cloaking serum.

1292

because of a chemical

into my bloodstream

dissolved.

- Hello, I need
Dr. Rosen's office, please.

You've got to stop her, John.

1299

- It's not her fault.

- She'll compromise us again.

- You'll go back
to the hospital.

Yes.

Why did you
stop your meds?

1337
01:39:38,753 --> 01:39:41,085
Because I couldn't do my work.

1338

to be another way.

Schizophrenia is degenerative.

1347
01:40:04,612 --> 01:40:06,580
Some days may be
symptom-free,

1348
01:40:06,647 --> 01:40:08,342
but over time,
you are getting worse.

1349
01:40:08,416 --> 01:40:11,442
It's a problem. That's all it is.

1350
01:40:11,519 --> 01:40:14,352
It's a problem with no solution.

1351
01:40:14,422 --> 01:40:16,151
And that's what I do,
I solve problems.

1352
01:40:16,223 --> 01:40:17,884
- That's what I do best.
- This isn't math.

1353
01:40:17,958 --> 01:40:19,721
Dr. Rosen.
You can't come up
with a formula

1354

to change the way
you experience the world.

1355
01:40:21,662 --> 01:40:24,597
- All I have to do
is apply my mind.
- There's no theorem, no proof.

1356
01:40:24,665 --> 01:40:27,395
- You can't reason
your way out of this.
- Why not? Why can't I?

1357
01:40:27,468 --> 01:40:30,266
Because your mind
is where the problem is
in the first place.

1358
01:40:32,239 --> 01:40:34,469
I can do this.

1359
01:40:34,542 --> 01:40:38,171
I can work it out.
All I need is time.

1360
01:40:41,215 --> 01:40:43,706

may take over...

I can't go back
to that hospital.

1369
01:41:40,274 --> 01:41:42,367
I won't come home.

if you said that,

1371
01:41:48,182 --> 01:41:52,619
he has commitment
papers for me to sign.

1372
01:41:54,955 --> 01:41:56,718
Well, maybe you
won't sign them.

1373
01:41:58,559 --> 01:42:00,618
Maybe you'll just
give me some time.

1374
01:42:03,497 --> 01:42:05,522
I will try to figure this out.

1375

Whatever you do,

1376
01:42:09,804 --> 01:42:13,137
Rosen is right
about one thing.

1377
01:42:13,207 --> 01:42:15,732
You shouldn't be here.

1378
01:42:18,112 --> 01:42:20,046
I'm not safe anymore.

Would you have hurt me, John?

1380
01:42:37,097 --> 01:42:38,758
I don't know.

1381
01:42:40,434 --> 01:42:43,528
Maybe you should let
Dr. Rosen drive you to your mother's.

that knows the waking
from the dream,

1395
01:44:48,662 --> 01:44:50,630

01:47:00,928 --> 01:47:02,520
Yeah.

1413
01:47:02,596 --> 01:47:05,121
Yeah, I stole it from him.

1414
01:47:07,468 --> 01:47:09,959
Seems that you won
after all, Martin.

1415
01:47:11,338 --> 01:47:14,307
They were wrong, John.
No one wins.

1416
01:47:14,374 --> 01:47:17,104
Please, please have a seat.

1417
01:47:17,177 --> 01:47:20,112
God, it's so good
to see you.

1418
01:47:22,216 --> 01:47:24,582
What brings you
back to Princeton?

1419
01:47:24,651 --> 01:47:26,016
Charles. John?

1420
01:47:26,086 --> 01:47:29,317
John, I'm sorry,
but you have to tell him.

1421
01:47:29,389 --> 01:47:31,482
Tell him you're a genius.
You're a genius, John!

1422
01:47:31,558 --> 01:47:33,150
Tell him your work is critical.

1423
01:47:33,227 --> 01:47:35,491
John, please!

1424
01:47:49,076 --> 01:47:52,603
Is there any chance
that you could ignore
what I just did?

1425
01:47:54,281 --> 01:47:57,182
Of course,
what are old friends for?

1426
01:47:57,251 --> 01:48:00,880
Is that what we are, Martin?
Friends?

1427
01:48:00,954 --> 01:48:03,047
John, of course.

1428
01:48:03,123 --> 01:48:05,887
Of course.
We always have been.

1429
01:48:11,098 --> 01:48:13,032
Alicia and I think that...

1430
01:48:13,100 --> 01:48:14,897
That fitting in,

1431
01:48:14,968 --> 01:48:16,959
being part of a community,

1432
01:48:19,273 --> 01:48:21,036
might do me some good.

1433
01:48:21,108 --> 01:48:23,008
That a certain level of attachment,

1434
01:48:23,076 --> 01:48:25,067
familiar places, familiar people,

1435
01:48:26,547 --> 01:48:28,344
might help me...

1436
01:48:28,415 --> 01:48:30,906
elbow out these...

1437
01:48:34,221 --> 01:48:37,213
These certain delusions that I have.

1438
01:48:41,895 --> 01:48:44,557
It's a lot to ask,
and now that I'm here,

1439
01:48:46,967 --> 01:48:49,128
I'm quite certain
that you will just say no.

1440
01:48:52,439 --> 01:48:55,237
But I was wondering
if I could hang around.

1441
01:48:56,276 --> 01:48:58,176
(Sighs)

1442
01:49:03,917 --> 01:49:05,407
Huh.

1443
01:49:09,456 --> 01:49:11,617
Will you be needing an office?

1444
01:49:15,929 --> 01:49:17,794
No.

1445
01:49:20,601 --> 01:49:23,502
No, I could just work
out of the library.

1446
01:49:23,570 --> 01:49:26,130
Well, this guy tries
to wander into the library,

1447
01:49:26,206 --> 01:49:29,403
- but he doesn't have I.D.
- Why can't people read
their memos, huh?

1448
01:49:29,476 --> 01:49:31,171
Then he goes totally nuts.

1449
01:49:31,245 --> 01:49:33,475
John:
Not real!
You're not real.

1450
01:49:33,547 --> 01:49:35,447
There's no mission.

1451
01:49:35,515 --> 01:49:37,813
Oh, shit. Shit.

1452
01:49:38,819 --> 01:49:41,617
Not real!
You are not real!

1453
01:49:41,688 --> 01:49:43,553
Is this what you are, soldier?

1454
01:49:43,624 --> 01:49:44,921
Some useless ghoul?

1455
01:49:44,992 --> 01:49:46,983
The local madman?

1456
01:49:47,060 --> 01:49:49,688
- I'm not a soldier.
- You're gonna end up
in a cell!

1457
01:49:49,763 --> 01:49:52,027
Old, worthless, discarded.

1458
01:49:52,099 --> 01:49:53,327
There's no mission.

1459
01:49:53,400 --> 01:49:55,027
And while you rock and drool,

1460
01:49:55,102 --> 01:49:56,660
the world will burn to ashes!

1461
01:49:56,737 --> 01:49:59,171
You are not real!
You are not real!

1462
01:49:59,239 --> 01:50:00,934
You're still talking
to me, soldier.

1463
01:50:01,008 --> 01:50:04,307
There's no mission!
I'm not a soldier!

1464
01:50:04,378 --> 01:50:06,005
John? John?

1465
01:50:06,079 --> 01:50:07,944
John, John, John, John.

1466
01:50:08,015 --> 01:50:09,346
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey.

1467
01:50:09,416 --> 01:50:10,974
John, John!
It's okay.

1468
01:50:11,051 --> 01:50:13,178
I just heard what happened,
I'm sorry. John...

1469
01:50:13,253 --> 01:50:14,914
- I'm not a soldier.
- John. Hey, Nash.

1470
01:50:15,489 --> 01:50:16,854
Nash, hey.

1471
01:50:16,924 --> 01:50:18,915
Hey, you're all right.

1472
01:50:20,460 --> 01:50:22,587
Nash, Nash,
hey, hey, hey.

1473
01:50:26,366 --> 01:50:29,233
Ladies and gentlemen,
the greatJohn Nash!

1474
01:50:29,303 --> 01:50:30,998
Hansen:
John?

1475
01:50:32,606 --> 01:50:35,234
John.
You should've seen their faces.

1476
01:50:35,309 --> 01:50:38,039
Everybody was
just staring at me.

1477
01:50:38,111 --> 01:50:39,738
John...

1478
01:50:39,813 --> 01:50:43,010
you know that stress
triggers the delusions.

1479
01:50:43,083 --> 01:50:45,278
I know.

1480
01:50:47,554 --> 01:50:49,647
But then, on the way home,

1481
01:50:49,723 --> 01:50:52,556
Charles was there.

1482
01:50:56,396 --> 01:50:59,729
Sometimes, I really miss
talking to him.

1483
01:51:02,636 --> 01:51:05,036
Maybe Rosen's right.

1484
01:51:05,105 --> 01:51:08,597
Maybe I have to think
about going back into
the hospital again.

1485
01:51:08,675 --> 01:51:10,666
No.

1486
01:51:10,744 --> 01:51:12,974
Come here.

1487
01:51:16,316 --> 01:51:19,149
Maybe try again tomorrow.

1488
01:51:43,210 --> 01:51:46,646
John, now, you can't
ignore me forever.

1489
01:51:51,952 --> 01:51:54,147
Charles, you've been
a very good friend to me.

1490
01:51:54,221 --> 01:51:55,916
The best.

1491
01:51:57,090 --> 01:52:00,355
But I won't talk to you again.

1492
01:52:03,730 --> 01:52:05,925
I just can't.

1493
01:52:11,171 --> 01:52:13,662
Same goes for you, baby girl.

1494
01:52:13,740 --> 01:52:15,833
(Sniffs)

1495
01:52:21,515 --> 01:52:23,176
Good-bye.

1496
01:52:30,290 --> 01:52:32,155
Good-bye.

1497
01:52:46,073 --> 01:52:48,598
I was wondering if I might
audit your course.

1498
01:52:49,976 --> 01:52:53,002
It's... It's an honor,
Professor Nash.

1499
01:52:56,216 --> 01:52:58,309
Is something wrong?

1500
01:52:59,586 --> 01:53:01,884
This will be my first class.

1501
01:53:01,955 --> 01:53:04,082
(Laughs)

1502
01:53:05,292 --> 01:53:07,886
Good morning,

1503
01:53:07,961 --> 01:53:10,191
eager young minds.

1504
01:53:17,337 --> 01:53:19,464
(Muttering Numbers)

1505
01:53:29,983 --> 01:53:32,315
It's never gonna work, John.

1506
01:53:32,385 --> 01:53:34,876
You're just
humiliating yourself.

1507
01:53:37,457 --> 01:53:39,584
It's pathetic!

1508
01:53:39,659 --> 01:53:41,718
You are being pathetic.

1509
01:53:41,795 --> 01:53:43,786
I'm ashamed of you.

1510
01:53:58,545 --> 01:54:01,070
(Laughing)

1511
01:54:08,522 --> 01:54:10,956
(Laughing Continues)

1512
01:54:11,024 --> 01:54:13,117
Oh, man!

1513
01:54:16,830 --> 01:54:19,822
Are you coming?
You're gonna be late.

1514
01:54:22,636 --> 01:54:24,467
- Dad, you've got my book.
- What?

1515
01:54:24,538 --> 01:54:26,199
You've got my book.

1516
01:54:26,273 --> 01:54:28,673
Oh, right.

1517
01:54:28,742 --> 01:54:30,209
Thanks.

1518
01:54:31,211 --> 01:54:32,940
- Good-bye.
- Bye.

1519
01:54:33,013 --> 01:54:34,810
Alicia.
See you tonight.

1520
01:54:34,881 --> 01:54:36,849
Bye, honey.

1521
01:55:56,863 --> 01:56:00,799
Princeton University
October 1 97 8

1522
01:56:09,342 --> 01:56:10,934
Did you just solve Reimann?

1523
01:56:11,011 --> 01:56:13,206
Well, what do you think?

1524
01:56:13,280 --> 01:56:14,747
Huh.

1525
01:56:14,814 --> 01:56:16,338
That's an analog to Frobenius

1526
01:56:16,416 --> 01:56:18,384
for noncommutative extensions.

1527
01:56:18,451 --> 01:56:19,509
(Chuckles)

1528
01:56:19,586 --> 01:56:21,850
Yes, it is.

1529
01:56:21,921 --> 01:56:24,890
But it only appears
to work sporadically, so, no.

1530
01:56:24,958 --> 01:56:27,085
But...

1531
01:56:27,160 --> 01:56:29,492
I believe I'm
making progress.

1532
01:56:30,497 --> 01:56:32,488
You're...

1533
01:56:32,565 --> 01:56:35,398
You'reJohn Nash, right?

1534
01:56:37,837 --> 01:56:39,930
- Toby Kelly.
- Hello.

1535
01:56:40,006 --> 01:56:41,803
I've been studying
your equilibrium.

1536
01:56:41,875 --> 01:56:43,809
The one you wrote here,
at Princeton.

1537
01:56:43,877 --> 01:56:46,505
To come up with something
totally original, the way you did...

1538
01:56:46,579 --> 01:56:48,012
You know, I was young.
(Chuckles)

1539
01:56:48,081 --> 01:56:49,605
umm...

1540
01:56:49,683 --> 01:56:52,083
I've been developing a theory.

1541
01:57:06,366 --> 01:57:08,561
I believe I can prove

1542
01:57:08,635 --> 01:57:11,399
that Galois extensions
are covering spaces.

1543
01:57:11,471 --> 01:57:13,871
That everything,
everything is connected.

1544
01:57:13,940 --> 01:57:16,602
That it's all part
of the same subject.

1545
01:57:17,677 --> 01:57:19,668
When was the last time
you ate?

1546
01:57:19,746 --> 01:57:22,306
- Excuse me?
- You know, food.

1547
01:57:22,382 --> 01:57:24,350
Oh, uh...

1548
01:57:24,417 --> 01:57:26,408
My wife,

1549
01:57:26,486 --> 01:57:28,317
she loves mayonnaise.

1550
01:57:28,388 --> 01:57:31,619
Oh, thank you.

1551
01:57:31,691 --> 01:57:32,919
Thank you.

1552
01:57:33,927 --> 01:57:35,792
Go on.

1553
01:57:35,862 --> 01:57:37,955
The function...

1554
01:57:38,031 --> 01:57:39,999
- is in the two categories.
- Um-hmm.

1555
01:57:44,170 --> 01:57:45,797
Hansen.
Alicia!

1556
01:57:45,872 --> 01:57:48,534
Alicia!

1557
01:57:48,608 --> 01:57:51,805
John.
...coming together
at maximum speed of...

1558
01:57:51,878 --> 01:57:53,971
let us say
1 0 miles per hour.

1559
01:57:54,047 --> 01:57:57,346
So you have a fly
on the tire of bicycle B,

1560
01:57:57,417 --> 01:58:00,386
and the fly, who can travel
at 20 miles an hour,

1561
01:58:00,453 --> 01:58:02,114
leaves the tire
of bicycle B and it flies

1562
01:58:02,188 --> 01:58:04,315
to the tire of bicycle a
and backwards and forwards

1563
01:58:04,391 --> 01:58:06,723
and so on and so forth
until the two bikes collide

1564
01:58:06,793 --> 01:58:08,556
and the poor little fly
is squashed.

1565
01:58:08,628 --> 01:58:10,789
- (Chuckling)
- This is the important thing

1566
01:58:10,864 --> 01:58:12,889
about actually focusing in
and comprehending

1567
01:58:12,966 --> 01:58:14,991
the area that you're
dealing with.

1568
01:58:15,068 --> 01:58:17,901
Mathematics is very specific,
and it is an art form,

1569
01:58:17,971 --> 01:58:20,303
no matter what these people
around here will tell you,

1570
01:58:20,373 --> 01:58:21,806
especially the people from biology.

1571
01:58:21,875 --> 01:58:23,399
Don't listen to any
of those people.

1572
01:58:23,476 --> 01:58:25,808
Let me go back
to what you were doing before.

1573
01:58:25,879 --> 01:58:29,178
I might want to steal this,
write a book and get famous.

1574
01:58:30,316 --> 01:58:32,614
I was thinking
that I might teach.

1575
01:58:33,987 --> 01:58:36,080
A classroom with 50 students

1576
01:58:36,156 --> 01:58:39,148
can be daunting for anyone.

1577
01:58:39,225 --> 01:58:42,058
John, besides,
you're a terrible teacher.

1578
01:58:43,062 --> 01:58:46,031
I'm an acquired
taste, Martin.

1579
01:58:46,099 --> 01:58:49,068
I was hoping there still
might be something
I could contribute.

1580
01:58:49,135 --> 01:58:51,126
What about the...

1581
01:58:51,204 --> 01:58:53,263
Well, you know.

1582
01:58:53,339 --> 01:58:55,705
Are they gone?

1583
01:59:01,681 --> 01:59:04,616
No, they're not gone.

1584
01:59:04,684 --> 01:59:06,311
And maybe they
never will be.

1585
01:59:06,386 --> 01:59:08,115
But I've gotten used
to ignoring them

1586
01:59:08,188 --> 01:59:11,589
and I think as a result
they've kind of given up on me.

1587
01:59:11,658 --> 01:59:13,592
You think that's what it's like

1588
01:59:13,660 --> 01:59:17,357
with all our dreams
and our nightmares, Martin?

1589
01:59:17,430 --> 01:59:20,456
You've got to keep feeding them
for them to stay alive?

1590
01:59:20,533 --> 01:59:24,025
John, they...
haunt you, though.

1591
01:59:24,103 --> 01:59:28,802
They're my past, Martin.
Everybody's haunted by their past.

1592
01:59:31,811 --> 01:59:33,745
Well, good-bye.

1593
01:59:33,813 --> 01:59:36,281
John, I'll talk
to the department.

1594
01:59:38,218 --> 01:59:40,083
Maybe in the spring.

1595
01:59:45,658 --> 01:59:47,523
Hey, Nash?

1596
01:59:49,162 --> 01:59:51,460
You...

1597
01:59:51,531 --> 01:59:53,226
you scared?

1598
01:59:55,668 --> 01:59:57,602
Terrified.

1599
01:59:57,670 --> 02:00:00,070
Mortified.
Petrified.

1600
02:00:00,139 --> 02:00:02,869
Stupefied by you.

1601
02:00:02,942 --> 02:00:04,273
Now you ought best ring Alicia,

1602
02:00:04,344 --> 02:00:06,437
- or you're gonna get me...
- I'll ring her.

1603
02:00:06,513 --> 02:00:07,878
...in an awful
lot of trouble.

1604
02:00:11,751 --> 02:00:13,514
- Thanks, Professor.
- Good-bye.

1605
02:00:13,586 --> 02:00:15,554
- Have a nice day.
- Good-bye.

1606
02:00:15,622 --> 02:00:18,455
Papers in hand, Mr. Beyer.
"Princeton University
March 1 994"

1607
02:00:18,525 --> 02:00:20,516
Professor Nash?

1608
02:00:23,763 --> 02:00:26,391
- Can you see him?
- Yeah.

1609
02:00:26,466 --> 02:00:28,058
- You sure?
- Uh-huh.

1610
02:00:28,134 --> 02:00:30,295
Positive?
He's within your vision?

1611
02:00:30,370 --> 02:00:31,962
- (Laughing)
- Okay. Good.

1612
02:00:32,038 --> 02:00:35,030
Forgive me, I'm just
always suspicious of new people.

1613
02:00:35,108 --> 02:00:37,474
- See you next week, Professor.
- See you next week.

1614
02:00:38,511 --> 02:00:40,411
So now that I know
that you're real,

1615
02:00:40,480 --> 02:00:42,948
who are you, and what can
I do for you?

1616
02:00:43,016 --> 02:00:46,417
Professor, my name
is Thomas King...

1617
02:00:46,486 --> 02:00:47,612
- Thomas King?
- Mmm-hm.

1618
02:00:47,687 --> 02:00:49,086
...and I'm here
to tell you

1619
02:00:49,155 --> 02:00:52,283
that you're being considered
for the Nobel prize.

1620
02:00:59,799 --> 02:01:02,529
John:
Forgive me, but I'm just
a little stunned.

1621
02:01:02,602 --> 02:01:05,093
King:
Over the past few years
your equilibrium

1622
02:01:05,171 --> 02:01:07,765
has become a cornerstone
of modern economics.

1623
02:01:07,840 --> 02:01:10,104
Suddenly everybody
likes that one.

1624
02:01:10,176 --> 02:01:14,476
What about my work
on other some such projects...
manifold embedding?

1625
02:01:14,547 --> 02:01:17,744
The application
of your bargaining problem

1626
02:01:17,817 --> 02:01:22,151
to F.C.C. bandwidth auctions
or to antitrust cases...

1627
02:01:22,221 --> 02:01:23,950
- Antitrust cases?
- Yes.

1628
02:01:24,023 --> 02:01:26,321
I never would have
considered that.

1629
02:01:26,392 --> 02:01:27,984
- Well...
- Have I just reached

1630
02:01:28,061 --> 02:01:30,791
some level of honesty
that borders on stupidity?

1631
02:01:30,863 --> 02:01:32,728
(Laughs)
No, no, you haven't.

1632
02:01:32,799 --> 02:01:34,824
'Cause, I wouldn't
have thought of that.

1633
02:01:39,939 --> 02:01:42,032
Shall we have tea?

1634
02:01:43,977 --> 02:01:46,343
Oh, I don't go in there.
I usually just

1635
02:01:46,412 --> 02:01:48,277
take my sandwich
in the library.

1636
02:01:48,348 --> 02:01:52,341
Come on, John.
Let's have some tea.
It's a big day.

1637
02:01:52,418 --> 02:01:54,443
M-Most...

1638
02:01:54,520 --> 02:01:56,420
Most commercially
available brands of tea

1639
02:01:56,489 --> 02:01:58,116
are not suitable to my palate.

1640
02:01:58,191 --> 02:01:59,818
I'm not...

1641
02:01:59,892 --> 02:02:03,123
There are some
northern Indian teas
which are dense enough...

1642
02:02:03,196 --> 02:02:05,790
I enjoy the flavor
that they have...

1643
02:02:05,865 --> 02:02:07,594
I have not been in this room

1644
02:02:07,667 --> 02:02:10,693
for some many years.
I wonder what tea they serve.

1645
02:02:12,338 --> 02:02:13,965
John.
Why, thank you, young lady.

1646
02:02:16,342 --> 02:02:18,708
Things have certainly
changed around here.

1647
02:02:18,778 --> 02:02:21,042
I have a son that age.

1648
02:02:21,114 --> 02:02:24,083
- Harvard.
- (King Chuckles)

1649
02:02:27,286 --> 02:02:29,379
Hmm.

1650
02:02:29,455 --> 02:02:32,015
I would have thought
the nominations

1651
02:02:32,091 --> 02:02:34,559
for the Nobel prize
would have been secret.

1652
02:02:34,627 --> 02:02:38,063
I would have thought
you'd only find out
if you won or lost.

1653
02:02:38,131 --> 02:02:40,292
That is generally
the case, yes.

1654
02:02:40,366 --> 02:02:42,527
But these are
special circumstances.

1655
02:02:43,803 --> 02:02:46,101
The awards are substantial.

1656
02:02:46,172 --> 02:02:50,734
They require private funding.
As such,

1657
02:02:50,810 --> 02:02:53,802
the image of the Nobel is...

1658
02:02:55,081 --> 02:02:58,141
I see. You came here
to find out if I was crazy?

1659
02:02:59,385 --> 02:03:01,615
Find out if I would

1660
02:03:01,688 --> 02:03:03,679
screw everything up
if I actually won?

1661
02:03:05,224 --> 02:03:08,387
Dance around the podium,
strip naked and squawk
like a chicken,

1662
02:03:08,461 --> 02:03:09,826
things of this nature?

1663
02:03:09,896 --> 02:03:12,364
Something like that, yes.

1664
02:03:13,366 --> 02:03:15,357
Would I embarrass you?

1665
02:03:18,905 --> 02:03:21,066
Yes, it is possible.

1666
02:03:23,776 --> 02:03:25,869
You see, l...

1667
02:03:25,945 --> 02:03:28,937
I am crazy.

1668
02:03:30,950 --> 02:03:33,111
I take the newer medications,

1669
02:03:36,522 --> 02:03:39,514
but I still see things
that are not here.

1670
02:03:41,728 --> 02:03:43,958
I just choose
not to acknowledge them.

1671
02:03:46,065 --> 02:03:47,896
Like a diet of the mind,

1672
02:03:47,967 --> 02:03:50,401
I choose not to indulge
certain appetites.

1673
02:03:52,805 --> 02:03:55,706
Like my appetite for patterns.

1674
02:03:57,310 --> 02:04:01,303
Perhaps my appetite
to imagine and to dream.

1675
02:04:02,315 --> 02:04:04,249
Man.
Professor Nash.

1676
02:04:08,387 --> 02:04:11,823
It's good to have
you here, John.

1677
02:04:11,891 --> 02:04:13,825
Thank you.

1678
02:04:17,997 --> 02:04:22,434
- It's an honor, sir.
- Thank you very much.

1679
02:04:22,502 --> 02:04:24,231
A privilege, Professor.

1680
02:04:28,508 --> 02:04:29,998
Professor.

1681
02:04:35,348 --> 02:04:38,374
- Nicely done, John.
- Thank you, Tom.

1682
02:04:39,519 --> 02:04:41,316
Thank you.

1683
02:04:41,387 --> 02:04:44,083
Thank you.

1684
02:04:52,165 --> 02:04:54,497
Thank you, Ed.

1685
02:05:02,041 --> 02:05:05,010
That was certainly most unexpected.

1686
02:05:05,077 --> 02:05:08,342
(Applause)

December 1 994

1689
02:05:25,998 --> 02:05:28,262
John.
Thank you.

1690
02:05:29,669 --> 02:05:32,263
(Applause Fades)

1691
02:05:32,338 --> 02:05:34,670
I've always believed in numbers.

1692
02:05:34,740 --> 02:05:37,300
In the equations and logics

1693
02:05:37,376 --> 02:05:39,310
that lead to reason.

1694
02:05:39,378 --> 02:05:42,279
But after a lifetime
of such pursuits,

1695
02:05:43,015 --> 02:05:44,846
I ask,

1696
02:05:44,917 --> 02:05:47,477
what truly is logic?

1697
02:05:47,553 --> 02:05:50,681
Who decides reason?

1698
02:05:52,124 --> 02:05:55,582
My quest has taken me
through the physical,

1699
02:05:55,661 --> 02:05:57,526
the metaphysical,

1700
02:05:58,998 --> 02:06:00,966
the delusional,

1701
02:06:02,068 --> 02:06:04,093
and back.

1702
02:06:05,771 --> 02:06:09,002
And I have made the most important
discovery of my career.

1703
02:06:10,943 --> 02:06:14,276
The most important discovery
of my life.

1704
02:06:16,716 --> 02:06:20,311
It is only in the mysterious
equations of love

1705
02:06:20,386 --> 02:06:23,412
that any logical
reasons can be found.

1706
02:06:26,826 --> 02:06:30,091
I'm only here tonight
because of you.

1707
02:06:31,297 --> 02:06:34,323
You are the reason I am.

1708
02:06:38,004 --> 02:06:40,837
You are all my reasons.

1709
02:06:44,677 --> 02:06:46,770
Thank you.

1710
02:07:40,366 --> 02:07:42,857
John:
So nice to have met you.

1711
02:07:45,571 --> 02:07:47,368
I'll call for the car, Dad.

1712
02:07:47,440 --> 02:07:48,907
Bye-bye.

1713
02:07:48,975 --> 02:07:50,636
Woman:
Bye-bye.

1714
02:07:50,710 --> 02:07:53,645
- Are you ready to go now?
- Oh, yes, I am.

1715
02:07:53,713 --> 02:07:56,273
Yes, indeed,
and yes, please.

1716
02:07:56,349 --> 02:07:59,147
Thank you so much.

1717
02:07:59,218 --> 02:08:00,583
Thank you.

1718
02:08:03,122 --> 02:08:05,352
What is it? What's wrong?

1719
02:08:09,628 --> 02:08:10,959
Nothing.

1720
02:08:11,964 --> 02:08:13,955
Nothing at all.

1721
02:08:15,901 --> 02:08:18,563
- Come with me, young lady.
- Oh-hh...

1722
02:08:18,637 --> 02:08:21,105
I have a car outside.

1723
02:08:21,173 --> 02:08:24,631
Are you interested in a ride?
"Nash's theories have influenced
global trade negotiations..."

1724
02:08:24,710 --> 02:08:29,113
Where's it going to?
"national labor relations, and even
breakthroughs in evolutionary biology."

1725
02:08:29,181 --> 02:08:32,776
John and Alicia Nash live
in Princeton, New Jersey.

1726
02:08:32,852 --> 02:08:35,980
John keeps regular office hours
in the Mathematics Department.

1727
02:08:36,055 --> 02:08:38,421
He still walks to campus every day.

1728
02:08:46,699 --> 02:08:50,396
I will 

1729
02:08:50,469 --> 02:08:53,961
 Watch you 

1730
02:08:54,040 --> 02:09:00,843
In the darkness 

1731
02:09:00,913 --> 02:09:04,781
Show you 

1732
02:09:04,850 --> 02:09:08,308
Love will 

1733
02:09:08,387 --> 02:09:14,485
See you through 

1734
02:09:16,262 --> 02:09:23,634
 When the bad dreams 

1735
02:09:23,702 --> 02:09:30,767
 Wake you crying 

1736
02:09:30,843 --> 02:09:36,873
I show you 

1737
02:09:36,949 --> 02:09:45,118
All love can do 

1738
02:09:46,392 --> 02:09:53,423
 What love can do 

1739
02:09:53,499 --> 02:09:57,435
I will watch
through the night 

1740
02:09:57,503 --> 02:10:01,599
Hold you in my arms 

1741
02:10:01,674 --> 02:10:03,369
 Give you dreams 

1742
02:10:03,442 --> 02:10:08,641
 Where none will be 

1743
02:10:08,714 --> 02:10:12,844
I will watch
through the dark 

1744
02:10:12,918 --> 02:10:16,615
 Till the morning comes 

1745
02:10:16,689 --> 02:10:19,624
All the light 

1746
02:10:19,692 --> 02:10:22,024
I'll take you
through the night 

1747
02:10:22,094 --> 02:10:24,927
 To see 

1748
02:10:25,931 --> 02:10:28,991
 The light 

1749
02:10:29,068 --> 02:10:32,299
Showing us all love 

1750
02:10:32,371 --> 02:10:37,138
 Can be 

1751
02:10:38,477 --> 02:10:41,571
I will 

1752
02:10:41,647 --> 02:10:44,980
 Guide you 

1753
02:10:45,050 --> 02:10:52,957
 With my bright wings 

1754
02:10:53,025 --> 02:11:00,363
Stay till your heart 

1755
02:11:00,432 --> 02:11:09,136
Learns to see 

1756
02:11:09,208 --> 02:11:14,646
All love 

1757
02:11:14,713 --> 02:11:19,207
 Can...

1758
02:11:19,285 --> 02:11:27,317
Be.

1759
02:13:51,670 --> 02:13:56,039
(Female Vocal)
