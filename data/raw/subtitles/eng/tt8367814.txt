00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,334
<i>Get me in ten minutes, Ray.</i>

3
00:00:20,434 --> 00:00:21,434
<i>Boss.</i>

4
00:00:36,867 --> 00:00:38,900
- Bobby.
- Boss?

5
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,800
I'll have a pint
and a pickled egg.

6
00:00:42,334 --> 00:00:43,468
Coming straight up.

7
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,334
<i>If you wish to be
the king of the jungle,</i>

8
00:01:17,468 --> 00:01:19,700
<i>it's not enough
to act like a king.</i>

9
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,201
<i>You must be the king.</i>

10
00:01:25,468 --> 00:01:27,134
<i>And there can be no doubt.</i>

11
00:01:28,267 --> 00:01:32,334
Because doubt causes chaos
and one's own demise.

12
00:01:43,667 --> 00:01:44,734
Hello, my love.

13
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,867
It's date night tonight.

14
00:01:47,201 --> 00:01:49,201
Nine o'clock,
you and I, River Cafe.

15
00:01:53,468 --> 00:01:54,767
Who's there?

16
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,867
Ros, who's there?

17
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,567
Chink, chink.

18
00:04:35,267 --> 00:04:36,267
Fletcher.

19
00:04:36,867 --> 00:04:39,867
<i>Buenas tardes, Raymondo.</i>

20
00:04:40,001 --> 00:04:43,700
I should stab you with
that fucking rolling pin.

21
00:04:43,834 --> 00:04:47,834
Oh, don't be cunty. I was just hoping we
could have a cozy little drink together.

22
00:04:48,301 --> 00:04:52,834
So, I've got a meeting on Saturday
at your favorite newspaper.

23
00:04:53,934 --> 00:04:58,368
As the best private investigator
in this smoky little town...

24
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,633
good evening,
ladies and gentlemen...

25
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:04,934
they are ready to put 150 grand in
my pocket to give them some filth.

26
00:05:05,067 --> 00:05:07,368
Good for me, that,
but in this case...

27
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:10,301
it's bad for you.

28
00:05:11,834 --> 00:05:15,434
So Big Dave,
editor extraordinaire,

29
00:05:15,567 --> 00:05:19,368
has developed a terrible
antipathy for your boss

30
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,201
and his liquorish assortment
of tasty mates.

31
00:05:22,334 --> 00:05:27,401
He's out to destroy him and all those
that cozy up to him. Front cover. Bosh!

32
00:05:27,533 --> 00:05:30,034
There will be blood and fucking
feathers everywhere, my darling.

33
00:05:30,633 --> 00:05:33,134
Get to it, Fletcher.
I'm starting to itch.

34
00:05:33,267 --> 00:05:36,201
Now, we both know that your boss has
very, very deep pockets,

35
00:05:36,334 --> 00:05:39,368
and I would like to invite him just
to have a teeny rummage in them.

36
00:05:40,967 --> 00:05:42,700
What the fuck
are you talking about?

37
00:05:42,834 --> 00:05:44,500
If you would be so kind

38
00:05:44,633 --> 00:05:46,134
as to furnish me with
20 million British pounds,

39
00:05:46,267 --> 00:05:47,900
I will give you everything...

40
00:05:48,034 --> 00:05:51,134
memory cards, contact sheets,
recordings, the lot,

41
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:54,700
and a modest little screenplay
I wrote all by myself.

42
00:05:54,834 --> 00:05:55,867
Hold on.

43
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,034
We just went from £150,000
to 20 million.

44
00:06:00,167 --> 00:06:02,334
That's a steep rise
in 30 seconds.

45
00:06:02,468 --> 00:06:05,301
Yeah, but I would argue that you're
lucky, because that is nothing

46
00:06:05,434 --> 00:06:09,134
compared to what I could,
and perhaps should, be asking.

47
00:06:09,267 --> 00:06:12,201
Oh, well, thank God
you're not greedy, Fletcher,

48
00:06:12,334 --> 00:06:14,700
you deluded,
shit-eating cunt.

49
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:18,667
I quite like it
when you talk dirty to me.

50
00:06:19,867 --> 00:06:22,067
I can feel myself engorging.

51
00:06:22,834 --> 00:06:25,234
Come on, have a drink with me.
It's really yummy.

52
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:29,001
I looked it up. App-ed it.
1500 quid?

53
00:06:29,134 --> 00:06:31,734
I didn't know you could spend
that much on a bottle of scotch.

54
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:37,301
I'm gonna tell you a story to
demonstrate why my quote is my quote.

55
00:06:38,567 --> 00:06:40,267
Will you play a game
with me, Ray?

56
00:06:41,468 --> 00:06:42,967
I don't wanna play a game.

57
00:06:43,734 --> 00:06:46,468
- Please?
- No.

58
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,967
I said play a fucking game
with me, Ray.

59
00:07:27,792 --> 00:07:28,859
Right.

60
00:07:29,326 --> 00:07:30,426
Lovely.

61
00:07:30,925 --> 00:07:34,426
Now, I want you
to imagine a character,

62
00:07:34,559 --> 00:07:37,825
a dramatic character,
like in a book or a play or a film.

63
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:40,559
But not digital,
not on a memory stick.

64
00:07:40,692 --> 00:07:44,126
Analog. Chemical process.
"Keep the grain in the picture," I say.

65
00:07:44,259 --> 00:07:45,758
Old-school, 35 mill.

66
00:07:50,725 --> 00:07:52,459
Now, I'm seeing this
through a lens, I am,

67
00:07:52,593 --> 00:07:54,359
and I'm not talking about
the small screen.

68
00:07:54,493 --> 00:07:56,092
It's not TV, Raymond.

69
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:59,092
As I said,
old-school cinema format.

70
00:07:59,226 --> 00:08:03,025
It's what we in the business called
anamorphic, or ratio 2.35 to 1.

71
00:08:03,159 --> 00:08:05,925
And I want you to join me
on this cinematic journey,

72
00:08:06,059 --> 00:08:07,825
'cause it is cinema, Ray.

73
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:10,925
It's beautiful,
beautiful cinema.

74
00:08:11,859 --> 00:08:14,392
Now, roll camera.

75
00:08:16,593 --> 00:08:18,925
<i>Enter our protagonist.</i>

76
00:08:19,059 --> 00:08:21,226
<i>He's good-looking,
he's gorgeous,</i>

77
00:08:21,359 --> 00:08:24,625
<i>he's golden age,
he's a proper handsome cunt.</i>

78
00:08:24,758 --> 00:08:28,259
<i>His name is Mickey Pearson.</i>

79
00:08:28,792 --> 00:08:30,925
Unique background
has our Mickey.

80
00:08:31,059 --> 00:08:35,792
<i>American born, Rhodes scholar,
so he's born clever but poor.</i>

81
00:08:35,925 --> 00:08:38,593
<i>Now, that's quite a leap from
a trailer park in Americana</i>

82
00:08:38,725 --> 00:08:41,625
<i>to the thousand-year-old</i>
<i>university in old</i> Angleterre,

83
00:08:41,758 --> 00:08:45,126
<i>where he studies
the dark art of horticulture.</i>

84
00:08:45,259 --> 00:08:48,326
But he never finished his education,
never went home, because...

85
00:08:48,459 --> 00:08:50,625
<i>he found his vocation.</i>

86
00:08:50,758 --> 00:08:52,059
<i>A naughty vocation.</i>

87
00:08:52,892 --> 00:08:54,426
<i>He's a bad boy.</i>

88
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:57,159
<i>He starts dealing
the dirty wonder weed</i>

89
00:08:57,292 --> 00:09:00,459
<i>to his rich, British,
upper-class uni pals</i>

90
00:09:00,593 --> 00:09:02,925
<i>and realizes
he's rather good at it.</i>

91
00:09:03,059 --> 00:09:05,825
<i>He's clear and objective
about ambition</i>

92
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:09,459
<i>and he can surf the echelons
of our complicated culture.</i>

93
00:09:10,892 --> 00:09:14,326
<i>He knew how to take advantage
of his advantage.</i>

94
00:09:16,326 --> 00:09:17,992
<i>He was a hungry animal,
you see.</i>

95
00:09:18,126 --> 00:09:21,126
<i>He was powerful and ruthless,
cunning and quick,</i>

96
00:09:21,259 --> 00:09:23,625
<i>charismatic and smart, but...</i>

97
00:09:23,758 --> 00:09:26,493
<i>he had to do some naughty
things to get where he got,</i>

98
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:28,259
<i>to establish his position,</i>

99
00:09:28,392 --> 00:09:31,025
<i>to show he wasn't just
teeth, tits and tan.</i>

100
00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:33,959
Well, he wasn't
fucking hollow, was he?

101
00:09:36,859 --> 00:09:38,392
<i>He had an engine
under his hood</i>

102
00:09:38,526 --> 00:09:40,925
<i>and a gun in his holster.</i>

103
00:09:43,359 --> 00:09:45,825
So, he's not exactly clean,
our Mickey.

104
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:47,725
He has come up the hard way.

105
00:09:47,859 --> 00:09:50,459
He's earned his position,
shall we say.

106
00:09:50,593 --> 00:09:52,292
<i>Well, that was the early days,</i>

107
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:55,459
<i>and he cracked on with
his New World pioneer spirit.</i>

108
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:59,758
What's he worth today?
100, 200, 500 million?

109
00:09:59,892 --> 00:10:02,493
But now the plot
begins to thicken.

110
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:05,192
He has reached
a crossroads in his life.

111
00:10:05,326 --> 00:10:07,625
The middle class and the middle
age, they've got to him.

112
00:10:07,758 --> 00:10:11,292
They've corrupted his appetite
for the horrors. He's gone soft.

113
00:10:11,426 --> 00:10:14,292
He wanted to cash in his chips
and get out of the game,

114
00:10:14,426 --> 00:10:16,992
and he seems to have found
the perfect customer.

115
00:10:17,126 --> 00:10:18,459
Smash cut, please...

116
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,959
<i>to interior, a gala dinner.</i>

117
00:10:21,092 --> 00:10:24,025
Just a few words to say
thank you to Michael Pearson

118
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:26,625
for his limitless generosity
and time.

119
00:10:26,758 --> 00:10:31,226
<i>Now, Mickey has been cultivating
a special relationship</i>

120
00:10:31,359 --> 00:10:35,625
<i>with the erudite, learned and
broad-minded Matthew Berger.</i>

121
00:10:35,758 --> 00:10:39,126
Yes, Raymond, I do know about
the Jewish billionaire cowboy,

122
00:10:39,259 --> 00:10:42,326
another slice of Americana
creating drama in <i>Angleterre.</i>

123
00:10:42,459 --> 00:10:46,459
And finally to Matthew Berger
blindsiding us with his donation

124
00:10:46,593 --> 00:10:49,758
to build the entire cognitive
behavioral therapy unit.

125
00:10:50,259 --> 00:10:52,593
<i>So these two have met before.
Fuck knows where.</i>

126
00:10:52,725 --> 00:10:56,658
<i>Presumably at the annual international
drug dealers convention in Las Vegas.</i>

127
00:10:56,792 --> 00:10:58,859
<i>And they've done
some small deals together,</i>

128
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:01,326
<i>but now they're ready
for the big one.</i>

129
00:11:01,459 --> 00:11:04,226
Well, that was unexpected,
Matthew.

130
00:11:04,925 --> 00:11:07,159
Now I understand why you're
seated at the head of the table.

131
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:09,925
Snuck that one right by me, didn't
you, you naughty little girl?

132
00:11:10,292 --> 00:11:12,326
Making a splash
with the gentry.

133
00:11:12,459 --> 00:11:15,025
Oh, I like to make a splash
whenever possible.

134
00:11:15,493 --> 00:11:19,292
Well, you also seem to understand
the significance of a proper attire.

135
00:11:19,426 --> 00:11:20,825
Indeed I do.

136
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,259
I believe
a sense of ownership

137
00:11:22,392 --> 00:11:24,092
is vital
in every aspect of life,

138
00:11:24,226 --> 00:11:26,593
perhaps never more so than
when it comes to wardrobe.

139
00:11:26,725 --> 00:11:30,426
For every look there is a season,
and for every season a strategy.

140
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:32,959
<i>Now starts the alpha dance.</i>

141
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:34,725
<i>They're not really talking
about clothes, Raymond.</i>

142
00:11:34,859 --> 00:11:36,459
<i>Oh, fucking no.</i>

143
00:11:36,593 --> 00:11:38,259
<i>They're like
a pair of old doggies</i>

144
00:11:38,392 --> 00:11:40,825
<i>sniffing round one another's
intellectual assholes.</i>

145
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:43,625
<i>It's a good old-fashioned
cock-off, Raymond.</i>

146
00:11:43,758 --> 00:11:46,459
Michael, I'm looking forward
to doing business together.

147
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,426
- May we excuse ourselves?
- Yes, please.

148
00:11:50,359 --> 00:11:52,159
We should say good night
to our host.

149
00:11:57,059 --> 00:11:58,392
So what do you think?

150
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:00,493
I'm not sure.

151
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:01,625
Your Grace.

152
00:12:01,758 --> 00:12:03,159
He's a fox,

153
00:12:03,292 --> 00:12:04,959
and foxes
have a predictable nature.

154
00:12:05,092 --> 00:12:06,859
Trust this Jew
about that Jew.

155
00:12:06,992 --> 00:12:08,459
If you let him
in the henhouse,

156
00:12:08,593 --> 00:12:10,459
you can expect blood
and feathers everywhere.

157
00:12:11,593 --> 00:12:14,092
Fresh from
a farmyard pheasant shoot,

158
00:12:14,226 --> 00:12:16,959
these two are starting
to like each other.

159
00:12:17,092 --> 00:12:19,625
It's looking good, Ray.
It's looking fucking good.

160
00:12:19,758 --> 00:12:22,359
I'm impressed with what you've done with your enterprise.

161
00:12:22,493 --> 00:12:24,625
You see, try as I might,
I can't work out how you do it,

162
00:12:24,758 --> 00:12:26,526
and bush is my game.

163
00:12:26,658 --> 00:12:29,159
How does anyone grow
50 tons of super skunk

164
00:12:29,292 --> 00:12:31,192
without letting anyone else
know how they do it?

165
00:12:31,326 --> 00:12:33,725
I'm flattered to hear that
from you, Matthew.

166
00:12:33,859 --> 00:12:36,259
I imagine that big brain of yours
is sweating a stream of tears

167
00:12:36,392 --> 00:12:37,959
just trying
to figure it out.

168
00:12:38,092 --> 00:12:39,559
Brilliance
should be acknowledged.

169
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:40,758
Mm.

170
00:12:40,892 --> 00:12:42,625
Run the numbers
by me again.

171
00:12:42,758 --> 00:12:46,326
200 million gross p.a.,
100 million net.

172
00:12:46,459 --> 00:12:47,892
But your people
know this already.

173
00:12:48,025 --> 00:12:50,092
They've swept the numbers
for months now.

174
00:12:50,226 --> 00:12:54,126
The bottom line is I'll sell
it to you for 400 million.

175
00:13:00,725 --> 00:13:03,025
But you knew that already.
Hop in.

176
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:05,792
<i>Now, I can't be specific
about the heroes and zeros,</i>

177
00:13:05,925 --> 00:13:08,359
but there was a lot of money
hanging in the balance.

178
00:13:08,493 --> 00:13:11,992
Question: What would it be
worth to have the power

179
00:13:12,126 --> 00:13:14,692
to be able to pull the plug
on an operation like that?

180
00:13:14,825 --> 00:13:18,925
Answer: A greedy man would
want half the sale price,

181
00:13:19,059 --> 00:13:22,092
but a smart man would know
that 20 million pounds

182
00:13:22,226 --> 00:13:25,625
was just about uncomfortable enough
to make everyone feel comfortable.

183
00:13:26,326 --> 00:13:29,359
You're a cunning and creative
toad, aren't you, Fletcher,

184
00:13:29,493 --> 00:13:31,326
coming up
with a plan like this?

185
00:13:31,459 --> 00:13:33,359
Yeah, but I didn't really
come up with it, did I?

186
00:13:33,493 --> 00:13:34,959
It was Big Dave.

187
00:13:35,092 --> 00:13:36,725
He commissioned me
to do a job on Mickey,

188
00:13:36,859 --> 00:13:38,392
you know, sniff about,
keep an eye on him,

189
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:40,459
go through his bins,
reveal his sins.

190
00:13:41,092 --> 00:13:45,292
Mickey Pearson, the odious Yankee gangster.
We're gonna bury him.

191
00:13:45,426 --> 00:13:49,226
Because it seems he's got himself
a new friend. Lord Pressfield.

192
00:13:49,359 --> 00:13:52,292
Question:
Is that the Lord Pressfield?

193
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:53,992
<i>His Grace, the duke?</i>

194
00:13:54,126 --> 00:13:56,758
Yeah. Once fourth in line
to the throne.

195
00:13:56,892 --> 00:13:58,459
Apparently Mickey Pearson
has squeaked his way

196
00:13:58,593 --> 00:14:00,892
into the crack
of his fat, posh ass.

197
00:14:02,059 --> 00:14:05,493
This is yours, Fletcher. I need a man
with your creativity, with your nose.

198
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:07,326
Now, you know
you're my favorite bloodhound.

199
00:14:07,459 --> 00:14:09,259
I just think it's really
important to remember

200
00:14:09,392 --> 00:14:10,825
who you're talking to, Dave.

201
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:13,159
Of course I remember,
Fletcher.

202
00:14:13,292 --> 00:14:16,192
So just make absolutely sure the
check doesn't disappoint this time.

203
00:14:17,092 --> 00:14:18,992
The number is 150,000.

204
00:14:19,326 --> 00:14:22,025
He wants to ruin him,

205
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:25,092
but I am here
to do you a favor.

206
00:14:26,326 --> 00:14:28,992
And it's not like you're not
getting something for your money.

207
00:14:29,126 --> 00:14:32,259
You could even turn that script
into a feature film, Raymond.

208
00:14:32,825 --> 00:14:36,025
We could make it together.
We could be partners.

209
00:14:36,758 --> 00:14:38,493
I have learned off you lot.

210
00:14:38,792 --> 00:14:42,226
You gotta look after number
one, and now it's my turn.

211
00:14:43,392 --> 00:14:47,126
The sun is not going up
for me, Ray. It's going down.

212
00:14:48,526 --> 00:14:51,559
So why has Big Dave
got it in for my boss?

213
00:14:51,692 --> 00:14:53,725
Two months ago,
your man Mickey

214
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:56,459
<i>made my man Dave feel
like a right fucking idiot.</i>

215
00:14:56,593 --> 00:14:58,459
Henry. Mickey.

216
00:14:58,593 --> 00:14:59,725
How did he do that?

217
00:14:59,859 --> 00:15:01,226
Didn't accept his hand.

218
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:03,326
- Dave. <i>Daily Print.</i>
- Yes.

219
00:15:04,192 --> 00:15:06,259
No. Editor
of the <i>Daily Print.</i>

220
00:15:06,392 --> 00:15:09,159
<i>Turns out Dave had
gone after one of Mickey's lords,</i>

221
00:15:09,292 --> 00:15:11,192
<i>did a proper tabloid job
on him.</i>

222
00:15:11,326 --> 00:15:13,493
<i>It would appear that His
Lordship had had a quick spin</i>

223
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:15,859
<i>on one of
his attractive young footmen.</i>

224
00:15:15,992 --> 00:15:18,593
<i>After the splash, shares
crashed, job went, wife followed,</i>

225
00:15:18,725 --> 00:15:20,792
<i>and even his kids
disowned him.</i>

226
00:15:20,925 --> 00:15:23,226
<i>Well, that Dave
can't half be a cunt.</i>

227
00:15:23,992 --> 00:15:25,758
But no one
will pull him on it.

228
00:15:25,892 --> 00:15:28,192
Too fucking scared that Dave
will do a feature on them.

229
00:15:28,326 --> 00:15:31,126
<i>But your Mickey, he's got
a fabulous set of balls.</i>

230
00:15:31,259 --> 00:15:34,426
So he snubbed him in front of a crowd
that Dave could only wish he belonged to.

231
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:37,792
You know, lords and ladies, the sort that
Mickey feels very comfortable in front of.

232
00:15:38,392 --> 00:15:40,559
Men, excuse us.

233
00:15:40,725 --> 00:15:42,725
<i>Well, he might just as
well have pulled Dave's cock off.</i>

234
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:44,593
I do believe that was a bit
of a fuck off, Dave.

235
00:15:44,725 --> 00:15:46,692
<i>'Cause he just
fizzled like a party balloon.</i>

236
00:15:47,559 --> 00:15:49,426
That's no reason
to go after a fella.

237
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:52,226
Well, I don't know what to tell you.
He wants Mickey's blood.

238
00:15:52,359 --> 00:15:55,825
And he would be getting it
too, if it wasn't for...

239
00:15:56,859 --> 00:16:00,292
You're a filthy fantasist,
and now it's time to leave.

240
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:03,725
Oh, don't be silly.
I'm only just lubing you up.

241
00:16:03,859 --> 00:16:08,725
Now, there is a reason why Matthew,
or anyone else for that matter,

242
00:16:08,859 --> 00:16:11,825
cannot work out
how Mickey does what he does.

243
00:16:11,959 --> 00:16:15,758
How does he grow 50 tons of white
widow super cheese every year?

244
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:17,792
Everyone knows
that needs a lot of space.

245
00:16:17,925 --> 00:16:21,326
So where is the space and how
come he's kept it under wraps?

246
00:16:21,459 --> 00:16:24,625
<i>You can't just dig a hole in the ground
and drop 200 shipping containers in there.</i>

247
00:16:24,758 --> 00:16:26,326
<i>Oh, no, my love.
That will not work.</i>

248
00:16:26,459 --> 00:16:30,259
No. You have to be creative.
You need an angle.

249
00:16:30,392 --> 00:16:33,192
The problem with land in this
country is there's not much of it...

250
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:37,493
and there's public access even
when it's supposed to be private.

251
00:16:38,059 --> 00:16:40,959
And the public have rights:
dog walkers...

252
00:16:41,092 --> 00:16:42,758
Yes, jog on.

253
00:16:42,892 --> 00:16:45,326
<i>...footpaths, right to roam,</i>

254
00:16:45,459 --> 00:16:46,925
<i>bimblers, ramblers,</i>

255
00:16:47,059 --> 00:16:48,493
<i>badger lovers...</i>

256
00:16:49,226 --> 00:16:51,159
<i>...and any other busy cunt
with enough time on his hands</i>

257
00:16:51,292 --> 00:16:52,625
to sniff
the green tweed of England.

258
00:16:52,758 --> 00:16:54,259
Good morning!

259
00:16:54,392 --> 00:16:55,892
And they have groups,

260
00:16:56,025 --> 00:16:59,559
<i>forums, meetings,
social media,</i>

261
00:16:59,692 --> 00:17:01,559
<i>and they love
a good chat and a hiss</i>

262
00:17:01,692 --> 00:17:04,392
about anyone who's decided to
mow his lawn without a license.

263
00:17:05,526 --> 00:17:08,792
And then there's the helicopters,
drones, Google Earth,

264
00:17:08,925 --> 00:17:10,992
<i>heritage sites,
parish councils,</i>

265
00:17:11,126 --> 00:17:12,493
and the beat goes on.

266
00:17:13,292 --> 00:17:15,758
And that's before you even think
about getting power in here.

267
00:17:18,126 --> 00:17:21,159
So what is
Mickey's unique method?

268
00:17:21,292 --> 00:17:25,792
I tip my cap at the cheek,
at the elegance, at the class.

269
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,526
And what would
that method be exactly?

270
00:17:28,658 --> 00:17:30,992
You have to understand
a culture to understand a man.

271
00:17:31,658 --> 00:17:33,493
<i>Toffs, aristocrats,</i>

272
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:36,593
<i>dukes, duchesses,
lords and ladies,</i>

273
00:17:36,725 --> 00:17:38,593
lots of land
and fuck all dough.

274
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:42,493
<i>Houses to keep, damp to
keep out, silver to polish.</i>

275
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:45,625
You must remember
that cash is very persuasive

276
00:17:45,758 --> 00:17:49,159
<i>to the class that got spanked by
angry lefties and death duties.</i>

277
00:17:50,426 --> 00:17:53,992
<i>And every time you inherit a
fortune, you lose half to the state.</i>

278
00:17:54,126 --> 00:17:56,126
<i>So this is my moment to swoop in</i>

279
00:17:56,259 --> 00:17:58,292
<i>like a guardian fucking angel</i>

280
00:17:58,426 --> 00:18:01,825
<i>and offer my services so they
can keep their houses in order.</i>

281
00:18:01,959 --> 00:18:04,092
And they're not too bothered
about what I do,

282
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:07,658
<i>as long as that cash
keeps rolling in each year.</i>

283
00:18:07,792 --> 00:18:10,559
It's good to get a lord, yes,
but it's not easy.

284
00:18:10,692 --> 00:18:14,493
It takes work,
wine, women and disco.

285
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:17,825
<i>Twelve sites. Twelve farms.</i>

286
00:18:17,959 --> 00:18:20,859
<i>One thousand of these estates
in the great UK.</i>

287
00:18:20,992 --> 00:18:22,992
<i>Bonne chance</i>
trying to find them all.

288
00:18:24,159 --> 00:18:27,192
That's it. My infrastructure.

289
00:18:28,159 --> 00:18:32,758
And that, sir, is, with my
blessing, what you are paying for.

290
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:36,192
If it's as discreet and as
lucrative as you claim it is,

291
00:18:36,326 --> 00:18:38,025
I'll buy the whole business.

292
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:39,992
But enough foreplay, Michael.

293
00:18:40,593 --> 00:18:41,992
I wanna see your plant.

294
00:18:44,292 --> 00:18:46,392
I've gone to great lengths
to make my operation

295
00:18:46,526 --> 00:18:49,059
as invisible as possible,
Matthew.

296
00:18:49,192 --> 00:18:51,625
If you were standing on my
bush, you wouldn't know it.

297
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:57,226
As a matter of fact,
you are standing on my bush.

298
00:19:00,192 --> 00:19:02,226
It's a spectacular business,
Michael.

299
00:19:03,259 --> 00:19:05,092
Such a shame it will go
bankrupt in ten years

300
00:19:05,226 --> 00:19:07,326
when things go legal
in the great UK.

301
00:19:07,959 --> 00:19:10,292
And you want me
to pay top dollar for it?

302
00:19:10,593 --> 00:19:12,625
A nugget under half a yard?

303
00:19:13,892 --> 00:19:15,092
That is the price.

304
00:19:16,092 --> 00:19:18,859
Now step inside and I'll show
you what half a yard gets you.

305
00:19:23,825 --> 00:19:28,359
Ooh. A delightful tool shed
for 400 million dollars.

306
00:19:28,992 --> 00:19:30,792
Is the ball-peen hammer
included?

307
00:19:30,925 --> 00:19:33,825
Course it is.
Now let me show you the nails.

308
00:19:41,825 --> 00:19:42,925
Watch your head.

309
00:19:43,658 --> 00:19:44,992
Carry on, chaps.

310
00:19:56,226 --> 00:19:58,493
England's
green and pleasant land.

311
00:20:00,593 --> 00:20:02,092
Those are some nails.

312
00:20:03,459 --> 00:20:06,493
Location, staff, technology.

313
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:11,259
See, you're buying the substructure
for the superstructure to come,

314
00:20:11,892 --> 00:20:15,559
and with purchase you will
inherit the best sites available,

315
00:20:15,692 --> 00:20:18,792
the finest botanists and herb
sommeliers in the world,

316
00:20:18,925 --> 00:20:22,493
as well as the most innovative
marijuana technology on the planet.

317
00:20:23,658 --> 00:20:26,192
And when this little piggy
goes to legal market

318
00:20:26,326 --> 00:20:29,359
and the demand
way outpaces the supply...

319
00:20:30,326 --> 00:20:33,758
these locations,
these green-fingered botanical boys,

320
00:20:33,892 --> 00:20:36,192
as well as
my superior technology,

321
00:20:36,326 --> 00:20:37,625
will be at a premium.

322
00:20:39,059 --> 00:20:40,459
And you would own them all.

323
00:20:43,292 --> 00:20:47,326
Did you know it took 15 years after
alcohol prohibition ended back home

324
00:20:47,459 --> 00:20:49,593
for the legal market
to scratch that itch?

325
00:20:50,392 --> 00:20:52,159
Fifteen years.

326
00:20:52,758 --> 00:20:54,859
And that's if
you do nothing with it.

327
00:20:55,559 --> 00:20:58,292
Yes, it's a win-win,
no matter how you look at it.

328
00:20:59,859 --> 00:21:02,126
And I'm not greedy.
You and I both know

329
00:21:02,259 --> 00:21:05,459
that 400 million is a
fair-to-generous asking price,

330
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:08,725
especially considering
that once this game's kosher,

331
00:21:08,859 --> 00:21:11,658
it's going to be worth
somewhere between 200 billion

332
00:21:11,792 --> 00:21:15,092
and, well,
half a trillion pounds.

333
00:21:15,459 --> 00:21:16,625
Annually.

334
00:21:17,292 --> 00:21:18,658
Weed.

335
00:21:18,792 --> 00:21:19,992
Bush.

336
00:21:20,593 --> 00:21:22,092
Skunk-amola.

337
00:21:22,792 --> 00:21:24,992
White widow super cheese.

338
00:21:26,593 --> 00:21:27,959
It's the new gold rush.

339
00:21:29,126 --> 00:21:32,092
This is the thin end
of a very fat wedge, sir.

340
00:21:32,825 --> 00:21:35,758
If it's such a fat wedge,
why don't you keep it?

341
00:21:36,825 --> 00:21:41,092
You see, I've developed a reputation
as a man who came up the hard way.

342
00:21:41,825 --> 00:21:45,059
You could say that there's blood
on these pretty white hands.

343
00:21:46,059 --> 00:21:49,992
But in the new business,
once legal and under the jurisdiction

344
00:21:50,126 --> 00:21:54,126
of the respectable umbrella
of ministerial legitimacy,

345
00:21:54,259 --> 00:21:57,925
an enterprise like this will
need a face with a clean past,

346
00:21:58,059 --> 00:22:01,259
which sadly I do not possess.

347
00:22:01,392 --> 00:22:03,493
Retirement
doesn't sound so bad.

348
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:07,059
Long walks in the countryside,
pruning roses with my better half,

349
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:08,625
raising some cubs.

350
00:22:08,758 --> 00:22:11,326
I've earned it.

351
00:22:12,059 --> 00:22:15,992
Look, we both know growing
is only 50% of the business.

352
00:22:16,792 --> 00:22:18,758
I need
your European connections.

353
00:22:18,892 --> 00:22:21,092
I've seen
how the sausage is made.

354
00:22:21,226 --> 00:22:22,725
Now tell me
about the butcher shops.

355
00:22:23,658 --> 00:22:25,359
Well, that comes later,
Matthew,

356
00:22:25,925 --> 00:22:27,758
when the money's in escrow.

357
00:22:27,892 --> 00:22:31,192
Now that we've established
the dilemma of our protagonist,

358
00:22:31,326 --> 00:22:34,859
let us turn to our antagonist.

359
00:22:34,992 --> 00:22:37,859
Many miles away,
across the open plains,

360
00:22:37,992 --> 00:22:43,359
another beautiful feral beast
lopes his way to a watering hole.

361
00:22:43,493 --> 00:22:44,758
Who are you talking about
now?

362
00:22:44,892 --> 00:22:48,692
I talk, Raymondo, of Dry Eye.

363
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:50,326
Oh, Dry Eye.

364
00:22:50,459 --> 00:22:53,192
What is he?
Chinese? Japanese? Pekingese?

365
00:22:53,326 --> 00:22:54,692
Get on your fucking knees?

366
00:22:54,825 --> 00:22:56,625
Dirty dragon filth.

367
00:22:56,758 --> 00:22:59,925
<i>♪ Yellow is the color
Gambling is the game ♪</i>

368
00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:04,459
He explodes on the scene like a millennial
fucking firecracker. Bang, bang, bang.

369
00:23:04,593 --> 00:23:06,493
You chee-bye motherfuckers!

370
00:23:06,625 --> 00:23:08,593
<i>I'm gonna have to
stop you right there, Fletcher.</i>

371
00:23:09,126 --> 00:23:10,992
That doesn't sound like
the Dry Eye I know.

372
00:23:11,126 --> 00:23:13,593
Just making sure you're
paying attention, Raymond.

373
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:17,392
So let's cut instead
to a somewhat anticlimactic

374
00:23:17,526 --> 00:23:20,292
<i>but suave and debonair
Dry Eye,</i>

375
00:23:20,426 --> 00:23:22,259
<i>like a Chinese James Bond.</i>

376
00:23:23,426 --> 00:23:25,159
<i>"Ricense" to kill.</i>

377
00:23:26,992 --> 00:23:28,859
- Open them up.
- Yes, boss.

378
00:23:34,059 --> 00:23:35,459
Good Lord.

379
00:23:38,292 --> 00:23:41,025
Hose them down, load them up
and fuck them off.

380
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:43,925
- Let me have a look at 432.
- Yes, boss. It's just right here.

381
00:23:49,059 --> 00:23:53,259
There's 120 rims, uh,
32 LS engines, 60 custom...

382
00:23:53,392 --> 00:23:55,192
All right. Pay the man.

383
00:23:55,326 --> 00:23:59,059
Sorry, chaps. I quoted you for
a 20 when it's a 40-footer.

384
00:23:59,192 --> 00:24:01,259
It's gonna be double bubble.

385
00:24:01,925 --> 00:24:03,758
Double bubble?

386
00:24:05,259 --> 00:24:08,925
A gentleman's quote
is a gentleman's word.

387
00:24:10,059 --> 00:24:13,792
Now, either you or your family are
gonna have to pay for that lesson.

388
00:24:15,526 --> 00:24:17,059
Do we have an understanding?

389
00:24:18,226 --> 00:24:19,392
Yes, boss.

390
00:24:20,692 --> 00:24:22,459
Give the soppy prick
his money.

391
00:24:26,059 --> 00:24:28,259
<i>Anyway,
let's put a pin in Dry Eye</i>

392
00:24:28,392 --> 00:24:30,259
and turn again to Mickey.

393
00:24:30,725 --> 00:24:32,825
If you're thinking
of smoking that in here...

394
00:24:33,593 --> 00:24:34,526
don't.

395
00:24:34,692 --> 00:24:36,126
I find that confusing.

396
00:24:36,259 --> 00:24:39,493
Do you mean don't smoke
or don't think?

397
00:24:43,292 --> 00:24:44,925
Oh...

398
00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:46,959
Oh, all right, all right,
it's going out.

399
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:10,426
<i>I think the time has come
for me to introduce you to our queen.</i>

400
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:11,825
Harold, bag.

401
00:25:11,959 --> 00:25:13,725
<i>A Cockney Cleopatra</i>

402
00:25:13,859 --> 00:25:15,792
<i>to Mickey's cowboy Caesar.</i>

403
00:25:15,925 --> 00:25:19,559
<i>The only weak link in his
otherwise impregnable armor</i>

404
00:25:19,692 --> 00:25:23,493
<i>is his devotion, his passion,
some would say his obsession</i>

405
00:25:23,625 --> 00:25:25,292
<i>with his beauteous lady wife.</i>

406
00:25:25,426 --> 00:25:27,825
I'm trying to do you
a favor here, Mike,

407
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:30,292
but every time I do you a favor,
it ends up costing me too.

408
00:25:30,426 --> 00:25:32,758
- <i>Now, come on, Ros...</i>
- Why is Miss Kova still here?

409
00:25:32,892 --> 00:25:35,025
That Range was supposed
to be finished this morning.

410
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:38,159
- I'm not talking to you, Mike.
- Sorry, boss. Rodge is on the Range.

411
00:25:38,292 --> 00:25:41,025
How many times have I told you?
I don't want Roger up front.

412
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:43,625
This is a sanctuary
for the ladies. Where is he?

413
00:25:43,758 --> 00:25:45,526
He's up in your office
with your husband.

414
00:25:48,758 --> 00:25:51,359
Misha, darling, I'll have you
out of here in 20 minutes.

415
00:25:51,493 --> 00:25:53,992
Rosalind, I've got a spin
class in half an hour.

416
00:25:54,126 --> 00:25:55,959
Twenty minutes
and no charge.

417
00:25:56,092 --> 00:25:57,792
Lisa, champagne.

418
00:25:58,392 --> 00:26:00,625
- Mike, are you still there?
- <i>Of course I'm still fucking here.</i>

419
00:26:00,758 --> 00:26:03,892
Right, well, if you're still there,
who's ordering the fucking parts?

420
00:26:04,192 --> 00:26:05,392
So what do you think?

421
00:26:05,526 --> 00:26:07,259
Ringing the bell,
but not too loud.

422
00:26:08,025 --> 00:26:09,126
Dipped in honey.

423
00:26:10,092 --> 00:26:11,426
That's on the money.

424
00:26:12,226 --> 00:26:14,658
But you always could make
a good cup of tea, Mickey.

425
00:26:14,792 --> 00:26:16,292
Very nice.

426
00:26:17,226 --> 00:26:18,292
Hello, Ros.

427
00:26:19,526 --> 00:26:20,892
What the fuck
is going on in here?

428
00:26:21,392 --> 00:26:22,792
I should have known
it was you behind this.

429
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:24,825
Rodge is supposed to be
working down there

430
00:26:24,959 --> 00:26:26,426
and you're up here
blowing his brains out.

431
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,392
- I'm on it, boss.
- You wanna be.

432
00:26:28,859 --> 00:26:30,392
Don't blame the Dodge,
dear.

433
00:26:30,526 --> 00:26:32,059
You know he's got
a special nose

434
00:26:32,192 --> 00:26:34,025
and he's doing
this old dog a favor.

435
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:35,593
Dodge, get down there
and earn your money.

436
00:26:35,725 --> 00:26:36,758
Gone.

437
00:26:39,625 --> 00:26:41,259
What you doing here anyway?

438
00:26:41,392 --> 00:26:43,593
Thought I'd come by to have
a cup of tea with my wife.

439
00:26:44,259 --> 00:26:46,326
Well, go on, then.
Put the kettle on.

440
00:26:48,758 --> 00:26:50,459
Looks like
the deal's gone through.

441
00:26:51,326 --> 00:26:53,493
- Second thoughts?
- No second thoughts.

442
00:26:53,625 --> 00:26:55,292
I like middle age.

443
00:26:55,426 --> 00:26:58,792
I like gentrification,
private schools, fine wines

444
00:26:58,925 --> 00:27:02,658
and a spoonful of caviar
to help my medicine go down.

445
00:27:03,493 --> 00:27:06,892
But most importantly, I'm looking
forward to spending more time with you.

446
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:08,092
Course you are.

447
00:27:08,892 --> 00:27:10,493
Look, I don't want you
knocking around here

448
00:27:10,625 --> 00:27:12,925
feeling all unemployed
and lost with yourself.

449
00:27:13,426 --> 00:27:14,825
Well, fuck me.

450
00:27:15,593 --> 00:27:17,126
Most wives would beg
their other halves

451
00:27:17,259 --> 00:27:19,059
to get out
of this game, but not you.

452
00:27:19,192 --> 00:27:20,658
That's because
I know you, darling.

453
00:27:21,758 --> 00:27:24,892
Look, you'll have to
do this elegantly, love.

454
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:28,992
If word spreads that you're getting
out, that could read as weakness.

455
00:27:29,126 --> 00:27:31,292
And if you smell smoke,
it's 'cause there's a fire,

456
00:27:31,426 --> 00:27:33,593
and that could
get expensive.

457
00:27:33,725 --> 00:27:36,625
So you're gonna have to stamp that
out without any gentrification.

458
00:27:37,593 --> 00:27:38,658
But not you, love.

459
00:27:40,493 --> 00:27:42,192
Don't you do anything messy.

460
00:27:42,992 --> 00:27:45,259
That's why you've
got people, remember?

461
00:27:45,392 --> 00:27:47,426
I fucking love you, babe.

462
00:27:47,559 --> 00:27:48,925
Course you do.

463
00:27:49,892 --> 00:27:51,025
Any chance?

464
00:27:52,658 --> 00:27:54,426
No, you can wait.

465
00:27:54,859 --> 00:27:57,092
I've got a red-hot Russki
with her finger on the trigger.

466
00:27:57,226 --> 00:27:59,859
- Gotta deal with it.
- I don't mind the two of yous.

467
00:27:59,992 --> 00:28:01,692
Go on, fuck off.

468
00:28:03,625 --> 00:28:04,825
Fletcher...

469
00:28:06,259 --> 00:28:07,892
why are you
wasting our time?

470
00:28:08,392 --> 00:28:10,892
I know what happens in my
world and what doesn't.

471
00:28:11,025 --> 00:28:14,126
What I fail to recognize is
why Michael should be motivated

472
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:15,992
to write you
a check for 20 million.

473
00:28:16,126 --> 00:28:19,792
I find you very impatient, Raymond.
I am a storyteller.

474
00:28:19,925 --> 00:28:22,392
As they say in the film game,
I'm laying pipe.

475
00:28:22,758 --> 00:28:24,593
Well, you'd better put
something through it soon.

476
00:28:24,725 --> 00:28:27,126
So what is that?
Is that a barbecue as well?

477
00:28:28,925 --> 00:28:31,792
- Yes, it is, Fletcher.
- I love a barbie.

478
00:28:32,192 --> 00:28:33,959
That is a useful bit of plant,
then, isn't it?

479
00:28:34,092 --> 00:28:36,859
So that heats up your knees
and cooks at the same time?

480
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:39,692
You gotta show me
how to get one of them.

481
00:28:39,825 --> 00:28:42,126
Well, you can take it with
you if you fuck off now.

482
00:28:43,292 --> 00:28:44,593
Ray.

483
00:28:45,758 --> 00:28:47,126
Is there any chance
of a steak?

484
00:28:53,059 --> 00:28:56,825
Yeah, all right. Got a bit of
Wagyu in the freezer as it happens.

485
00:28:56,959 --> 00:29:00,426
- I've never had Wagyu.
- Yeah, well, it'll be wasted on you, but it's all I've got.

486
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:02,493
- I'll get it, mate.
- Oh, no, you're all right.

487
00:29:02,625 --> 00:29:04,526
- Just stay right there.
- Oh.

488
00:29:06,992 --> 00:29:08,159
Ow, fuck me!

489
00:29:09,625 --> 00:29:10,725
It's hot.

490
00:29:18,925 --> 00:29:21,959
He's a sly fox,
that Fletcher.

491
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,092
Night-night, Aslan.

492
00:29:30,792 --> 00:29:32,625
32 LS engines?

493
00:29:33,092 --> 00:29:35,292
You got all these parts
on a 40-foot container?

494
00:29:36,259 --> 00:29:37,259
Yeah.

495
00:29:38,092 --> 00:29:39,292
How'd you get
your hands on that?

496
00:29:40,892 --> 00:29:42,992
Ask no questions,
hear no lies.

497
00:29:43,459 --> 00:29:44,493
Hence the price.

498
00:29:45,459 --> 00:29:47,493
- So how much?
- Oh, no charge.

499
00:29:47,625 --> 00:29:49,925
Okay, so what's the price?

500
00:29:50,059 --> 00:29:51,259
A meeting with your husband.

501
00:29:51,392 --> 00:29:53,025
Oh, fuck off.

502
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:54,392
That's not gonna happen.

503
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:56,326
It's in his interest.

504
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:02,792
Tell you what, keep the parts.
Consider it a gesture of goodwill.

505
00:30:04,925 --> 00:30:06,593
You know
how to get hold of me.

506
00:30:08,259 --> 00:30:10,192
Well, I can't
promise anything.

507
00:30:10,326 --> 00:30:12,758
Dry Eye, he got his little
sit-down with Michael, didn't he?

508
00:30:13,625 --> 00:30:16,792
Bold move, that,
coming in heavy,

509
00:30:16,925 --> 00:30:20,226
sanctioned or unsanctioned...

510
00:30:21,226 --> 00:30:24,259
<i>by the dragon head himself,
Lord George.</i>

511
00:30:24,925 --> 00:30:27,159
<i>Well, he's a naughty boy,
that George.</i>

512
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:30,326
<i>But Dry Eye,
oh, he's next generation,</i>

513
00:30:30,459 --> 00:30:33,625
<i>and them Chinamen, they upgrade
quicker than i-fucking-Phones.</i>

514
00:30:33,758 --> 00:30:35,059
Is he making moves?

515
00:30:36,959 --> 00:30:38,792
<i>Is he breaking out on his own?</i>

516
00:30:38,925 --> 00:30:41,426
<i>Big man plans
behind Lord George's back?</i>

517
00:30:44,392 --> 00:30:48,192
To be fair, it was very nicely played
with 100 grand's worth of free car parts,

518
00:30:48,326 --> 00:30:52,792
because everyone knows that the way
to a man's heart is through his wife.

519
00:30:55,326 --> 00:30:57,192
You'd make a lovely wife,
Raymond.

520
00:31:07,725 --> 00:31:10,192
Thank you for taking the time
to see me, Michael.

521
00:31:11,059 --> 00:31:12,526
Lord George sends his best.

522
00:31:12,959 --> 00:31:15,692
I only took this meeting
because Ros asked me to.

523
00:31:15,825 --> 00:31:17,725
Make sure to never approach
her like that again.

524
00:31:18,359 --> 00:31:19,992
I meant no disrespect.

525
00:31:30,292 --> 00:31:31,392
How can I help?

526
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:33,925
I understand
you're getting out.

527
00:31:35,092 --> 00:31:37,892
Getting out.
Getting out of what?

528
00:31:38,025 --> 00:31:40,126
Bed? My head?
The closet?

529
00:31:40,625 --> 00:31:42,758
Don't flirt with me, Dry Eye.
I'm a busy man.

530
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:45,092
I hear you're
getting out of the game.

531
00:31:46,459 --> 00:31:49,526
And I would like you
to consider an offer.

532
00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:51,658
Look, I'm gonna stop you
right there

533
00:31:51,792 --> 00:31:53,758
so you don't waste any more of
your precious breath, young man.

534
00:31:53,892 --> 00:31:56,092
This is not a discussion
for the two of us.

535
00:31:56,226 --> 00:31:58,259
Unlike the salt and pepper,
it's not on the table.

536
00:32:02,758 --> 00:32:05,192
This is a big number.

537
00:32:27,226 --> 00:32:28,292
Cash.

538
00:32:28,859 --> 00:32:32,326
I am not for sale.

539
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:37,126
And even if I was,
you're several zeros short.

540
00:32:37,259 --> 00:32:39,459
Now, you may be able to buy
your man's sausage for that,

541
00:32:39,593 --> 00:32:41,666
but to me it just looks
rude at breakfast.

542
00:32:41,934 --> 00:32:43,000
You're out of touch.

543
00:32:46,133 --> 00:32:49,334
You're forgetting the laws of the
jungle, looking down on me.

544
00:32:54,501 --> 00:32:57,501
Now, when the silverback's
got more silver than back...

545
00:32:58,601 --> 00:32:59,868
he best move on...

546
00:33:02,033 --> 00:33:03,501
before he gets moved on.

547
00:33:04,667 --> 00:33:06,200
It's not dignified.

548
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,834
It's beneath you, Michael.
Trying to do you a favor.

549
00:33:12,868 --> 00:33:15,100
This is a big fucking number.

550
00:33:21,167 --> 00:33:22,601
And this?

551
00:33:23,434 --> 00:33:25,167
This is a big fucking gun.

552
00:33:33,467 --> 00:33:35,100
Eyes not so dry now, are they?

553
00:33:37,667 --> 00:33:38,801
Hurts, does it?

554
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:42,501
You looking for your balls
or a hole in the wall?

555
00:33:42,634 --> 00:33:45,300
- Fuck!
- Where the fuck do you think you're going?

556
00:33:45,701 --> 00:33:49,033
Because you're not going out the way you
came in, you deluded duck-eating cunt.

557
00:33:49,167 --> 00:33:51,834
Talking to me about the laws of the jungle.

558
00:33:51,968 --> 00:33:54,667
What was it? Something
about being beneath me?

559
00:33:54,801 --> 00:33:56,234
Silver on back?

560
00:33:57,434 --> 00:33:59,868
There's only one rule
in this fucking jungle.

561
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:03,334
When the lion's hungry,
he eats.

562
00:34:05,133 --> 00:34:06,200
<i>You're wrong, Fletcher.</i>

563
00:34:06,334 --> 00:34:08,000
That's not how Michael works.

564
00:34:08,133 --> 00:34:11,167
Yeah, I know. I know. I was
just having a bit of fun.

565
00:34:11,534 --> 00:34:13,400
Every movie needs
a bit of action, doesn't it?

566
00:34:13,534 --> 00:34:15,467
And it's not like Michael
doesn't have a reputation.

567
00:34:15,601 --> 00:34:17,334
Had a reputation.

568
00:34:17,968 --> 00:34:19,667
He's been gentrified.

569
00:34:24,667 --> 00:34:26,501
<i>...big fucking number.</i>

570
00:34:27,067 --> 00:34:31,367
I know how you lot love fables,
so let me share a little fable with you.

571
00:34:32,934 --> 00:34:35,133
There once was
a young and foolish dragon

572
00:34:35,267 --> 00:34:37,501
who came to ask
a wise and cunning lion

573
00:34:37,634 --> 00:34:39,934
about acquiring
his territory.

574
00:34:40,067 --> 00:34:43,000
Now, the lion, he wasn't interested,
so he told the little dragon to fuck off.

575
00:34:44,467 --> 00:34:46,868
But the dragon couldn't
understand what "fuck off" meant,

576
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,834
so he persisted and
continued to ask the lion

577
00:34:49,968 --> 00:34:51,868
about acquiring
his territory.

578
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,801
So the lion took
the little dragon for a walk

579
00:34:54,934 --> 00:34:57,634
and put five bullets
in his little dragon head.

580
00:34:59,334 --> 00:35:00,801
End of story.

581
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:06,167
Now, allegedly
there's a message in there.

582
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:09,467
I don't know what it is,
but you're a clever boy, Dry Eye.

583
00:35:09,601 --> 00:35:11,367
Maybe you can
explain it to me.

584
00:35:13,367 --> 00:35:15,167
I think your time's up,
chaps.

585
00:35:16,334 --> 00:35:18,501
Michael, you should recons...

586
00:35:21,167 --> 00:35:22,367
Just marinade on it.

587
00:35:23,834 --> 00:35:25,467
In the meantime, fuck off.

588
00:35:29,801 --> 00:35:33,133
Oh, I bet Mickey was pleased he
took that meeting, wasn't he?

589
00:35:33,267 --> 00:35:35,534
Yes, it went very well.

590
00:35:35,667 --> 00:35:37,701
- Yeah.
- Do you want the top or the bottom?

591
00:35:38,167 --> 00:35:39,801
The bottom, please, darling.

592
00:35:40,634 --> 00:35:43,267
Now, things started to unravel
after that meeting.

593
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:46,300
Didn't Mickey get a rat
infestation at one of his farms?

594
00:35:52,534 --> 00:35:53,734
Come on.

595
00:35:55,133 --> 00:35:56,200
Stealth, stealth.

596
00:35:57,667 --> 00:35:58,701
Go.

597
00:36:00,968 --> 00:36:02,300
Ballys down.

598
00:36:05,267 --> 00:36:07,200
Let's move. Go, go, go, go.

599
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Shit.

600
00:36:12,667 --> 00:36:15,467
Oh, my days.

601
00:36:16,033 --> 00:36:17,501
Fucking hell.

602
00:36:18,133 --> 00:36:19,467
He said
there'd be a bit of puff.

603
00:36:19,601 --> 00:36:21,067
Yeah, they weren't joking.

604
00:36:22,567 --> 00:36:25,267
Oi, fellas.
It's already packed.

605
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,601
Let's not mess about.

606
00:36:26,734 --> 00:36:28,033
Let's load it up, boys.

607
00:36:28,834 --> 00:36:30,167
Who the fuck are you lot?

608
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:32,100
Fuck. Cover up.

609
00:36:32,667 --> 00:36:34,033
Do you know
who owns this gaff?

610
00:36:34,434 --> 00:36:35,734
We don't give a fuck.

611
00:36:36,234 --> 00:36:37,767
I think you got off
on the wrong stop.

612
00:36:38,767 --> 00:36:40,100
Oi, Tezza!

613
00:36:40,234 --> 00:36:42,634
- What?
- Fancy a row?

614
00:36:44,767 --> 00:36:46,033
Who are these jokers?

615
00:36:46,167 --> 00:36:47,501
They want our gear.

616
00:36:48,167 --> 00:36:49,267
Marv!

617
00:36:50,267 --> 00:36:51,367
Who's this cunt?

618
00:36:51,934 --> 00:36:53,067
John!

619
00:36:54,133 --> 00:36:56,200
Oh, hello.
It's Dad's Army.

620
00:36:56,334 --> 00:36:57,667
Oi, Frank.

621
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:01,000
What's this?
Teddy bears' picnic?

622
00:37:01,133 --> 00:37:02,701
Oi, Mo!

623
00:37:04,133 --> 00:37:06,000
Any more rabbits
in that warren?

624
00:37:06,133 --> 00:37:07,300
You lads fancy a warm-up?

625
00:37:07,434 --> 00:37:08,634
Not for you Jelly Babies.

626
00:37:08,767 --> 00:37:09,968
On three, lads.

627
00:37:10,601 --> 00:37:11,534
Three.

628
00:37:13,367 --> 00:37:14,734
Hey!

629
00:37:14,868 --> 00:37:16,634
What? You wanna
call him back, Granddad?

630
00:37:17,534 --> 00:37:18,734
Fuck!

631
00:37:19,334 --> 00:37:20,634
Boss, let me get
two burgers on the stove.

632
00:37:20,767 --> 00:37:21,834
Get that quick, understand?

633
00:37:21,968 --> 00:37:23,767
And I want two chips as well.

634
00:37:23,901 --> 00:37:25,868
What is this smell
of wee in here?

635
00:37:28,133 --> 00:37:29,767
Who the fuck
is this joke, man?

636
00:37:29,901 --> 00:37:31,501
Don't stand near me, son.

637
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:34,868
You got your mouthwash
muddled up with cat piss.

638
00:37:35,334 --> 00:37:38,167
Take two steps back
and wait your turn.

639
00:37:40,767 --> 00:37:43,033
You better fuck off, old man,
or I'll wet you.

640
00:37:43,167 --> 00:37:45,267
The only thing you can wet's
your underpants, son.

641
00:37:45,567 --> 00:37:46,868
Now, back two steps.

642
00:37:47,434 --> 00:37:50,100
Trigger. That's you. Go on.

643
00:37:50,234 --> 00:37:51,868
- That's you. You're up, bruv.
- Yeah?

644
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,667
Do him. Fucking do him, lad.

645
00:37:53,801 --> 00:37:56,033
Stick it in him, bruv.

646
00:37:56,167 --> 00:37:58,200
Now, if you're gonna stab,
stab, Trigger.

647
00:37:58,334 --> 00:38:01,133
Don't, you know, dance.

648
00:38:01,267 --> 00:38:03,467
What are yous, like a Four
Tops tribute act or something?

649
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,734
The Foreskins. The Redskins.

650
00:38:05,868 --> 00:38:07,634
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Here come the Indians.

651
00:38:07,767 --> 00:38:10,234
Bit of the old Northern Soul,
is it, boys?

652
00:38:10,367 --> 00:38:12,868
Putting the gay
back in Marvin Gaye.

653
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,467
I'm on fire over here, lads. Come on,
I need some back and forth. Come on.

654
00:38:15,601 --> 00:38:18,167
What have you got for me?
Now, make it quick. Make it funny.

655
00:38:18,834 --> 00:38:20,801
Fuck you.

656
00:38:21,501 --> 00:38:24,067
Jeez, that's disappointing.
No, no, not that.

657
00:38:24,601 --> 00:38:26,400
Go again. Go again.

658
00:38:26,534 --> 00:38:29,100
Now, make it sharp.
Cut me with it.

659
00:38:29,234 --> 00:38:30,834
- Fucking do him, laddie.
- Come on.

660
00:38:30,968 --> 00:38:32,634
Yeah. Yeah.

661
00:38:32,767 --> 00:38:34,133
Oh, shit!

662
00:38:34,267 --> 00:38:35,467
Come on then, you dickhead.

663
00:38:36,501 --> 00:38:38,868
My eyes!

664
00:38:39,467 --> 00:38:41,267
Yous are embarrassing
yourself here, lads.

665
00:38:42,334 --> 00:38:44,834
Kids stab, girls shoot,
boys punch.

666
00:38:44,968 --> 00:38:47,934
Grown-ups fight with their heads.
That's where the real battle is.

667
00:38:48,067 --> 00:38:49,667
Up here, in the gray.

668
00:38:49,801 --> 00:38:51,334
He sparked me out, bruv.

669
00:38:51,634 --> 00:38:54,200
Now, wake up, lads.
Life's quick, you're slow.

670
00:38:54,334 --> 00:38:56,033
Life's hard on a bone top.

671
00:38:56,968 --> 00:38:59,400
Come on down the gym.
We'll see what we can do with yous.

672
00:39:01,634 --> 00:39:04,801
Hang on.
Are you the coach?

673
00:39:09,467 --> 00:39:10,968
Coach, it's Ernie.

674
00:39:11,534 --> 00:39:14,834
Shit. It's the fucking coach,
bro. It's the fucking coach.

675
00:39:14,968 --> 00:39:16,567
Ernie, what is it?

676
00:39:16,701 --> 00:39:18,234
<i>Ball's in the back of the net.</i>

677
00:39:19,167 --> 00:39:22,334
We've rung the bell here and we're gonna
include you, because you're our mentor.

678
00:39:22,467 --> 00:39:25,133
I don't know what you're talking about,
but I don't like the sound of it.

679
00:39:25,267 --> 00:39:28,968
- We've landed a load of sticky bush.
- <i>Listen to me, now, Ernie.</i>

680
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:31,033
Walk away.

681
00:39:31,167 --> 00:39:33,234
It's too late. We're at
the gym now unloading the van.

682
00:39:33,367 --> 00:39:34,601
You took my van?

683
00:39:35,267 --> 00:39:37,334
Wait there.
I'll be back in ten minutes.

684
00:39:38,133 --> 00:39:40,934
I'm sorry to intrude,

00:41:32,968 --> 00:41:35,601
Yeah,
but the best version of it.

731
00:41:35,734 --> 00:41:37,534

that fight porn online.

732
00:41:37,667 --> 00:41:39,934
It's white hot, Coach.
The hits.

733
00:41:40,067 --> 00:41:41,434
It's gone
intergalactic.

734
00:41:41,567 --> 00:41:42,934
What was I thinking,

735
00:41:43,067 --> 00:41:45,033
leaving you kids alone
unsupervised?

736
00:41:46,634 --> 00:41:48,767
Take it down. Now!

737
00:41:48,901 --> 00:41:51,167
I've gotta say,
I was impressed.

738
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:54,267
The way they fought?
They're on point, guvnor.

739
00:41:54,734 --> 00:41:56,934
Whoever trained them
knows what he's doing.

740
00:41:57,067 --> 00:41:58,367
Thank you.
That's enough.

741
00:41:58,801 --> 00:42:00,534
- Well, I'm just saying.
- Well, quit saying.

742
00:42:00,667 --> 00:42:02,133
Okay, thank you.

743
00:42:02,934 --> 00:42:05,868
No sooner do I entertain
Matthew's offer to buy me out

744
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,067
and reject Dry Eye's offer

745
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:09,901
does one of my farms
get raided.

746
00:42:10,033 --> 00:42:11,501
First time ever.

747
00:42:11,801 --> 00:42:13,467
Doesn't feel like
a coincidence, does it?

748
00:42:13,601 --> 00:42:15,667
It isn't.
There's fuckery afoot.

749
00:42:16,601 --> 00:42:18,901
- How did they find it?
- I don't know.

750
00:42:19,033 --> 00:42:20,300
I'm making inquiries.

751
00:42:21,534 --> 00:42:23,167
What about Matthew?

752
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,634
He's gonna need reassuring

753
00:42:24,767 --> 00:42:26,367
before he parts
with 400 big ones.

754
00:42:26,501 --> 00:42:28,400
So many questions
unanswered, Ray.

755
00:42:28,534 --> 00:42:32,300
I mean, who'd be smart enough
to find one of Mickey's farms?

756
00:42:32,434 --> 00:42:33,501
Apart from me, of course.

757
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:38,300
<i>And who would be bold enough
to make such a move?</i>

758
00:42:38,434 --> 00:42:41,334
<i>Especially to film it all
and then post it all online?</i>

759
00:42:41,467 --> 00:42:45,033
Because that is really rubbing
your face in it, isn't it?

760
00:42:45,834 --> 00:42:47,000
<i>I'm here to help, Michael.</i>

761
00:42:47,133 --> 00:42:49,601
I'm your friend, your ally,

762
00:42:49,734 --> 00:42:51,667
your Santa Claus
for all seasons,

763
00:42:51,801 --> 00:42:55,601
and I'd like you to know my team
of elves can be very persuasive.

764
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,701
Persuasive? And why
would I need persuasive?

765
00:42:59,834 --> 00:43:03,200
Well, I hear you might have
had a little trouble.

766
00:43:04,067 --> 00:43:06,133
Now, you helped me before
when my source ran dry,

767
00:43:06,267 --> 00:43:08,701
so I'm just returning
the favor and reminding you

768
00:43:08,834 --> 00:43:10,400
I have effectual friends.

769
00:43:10,534 --> 00:43:11,801
Elves?

770
00:43:12,367 --> 00:43:13,634
Elves?

771
00:43:13,767 --> 00:43:16,534
- Yes. You said elves.
- Did I?

772
00:43:16,667 --> 00:43:17,701
Mm.

773
00:43:18,467 --> 00:43:21,968
No trouble over here, Matthew.
No trouble at all.

774
00:43:24,701 --> 00:43:26,100
So we brought you
a token.

775
00:43:26,234 --> 00:43:27,367
You did?

776
00:43:29,133 --> 00:43:32,834
And what might this be?

777
00:43:32,968 --> 00:43:36,367
It's a paperweight to keep down all
the paper I'm about to give you.

778
00:43:36,501 --> 00:43:39,434
- Well, it looks like a gun.
- And it's a paperweight.

779
00:43:39,567 --> 00:43:43,868
Seeing how in this country,
unlike in our homeland, they're illegal.

780
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,601
So is riding your bicycle
at night without lights.

781
00:43:46,734 --> 00:43:48,334
Laws are there
as a guideline.

782
00:43:48,467 --> 00:43:51,100
In France, it's illegal
to call a pig Napoleon,

783
00:43:51,234 --> 00:43:52,601
but just try and stop me.

784
00:43:54,567 --> 00:43:56,767
I quite like it.
You're very kind.

785
00:43:56,901 --> 00:43:59,434
- Thank you.
- Hands across the sea.

786
00:43:59,567 --> 00:44:01,601
<i>Mickey calmed down the Jew</i>

787
00:44:01,734 --> 00:44:03,334
<i>and it seems the deal
is still going ahead.</i>

788
00:44:03,801 --> 00:44:07,367
<i>But bad timing, jeopardizing
deals, shutting down farms.</i>

789
00:44:07,501 --> 00:44:11,534
<i>It could be an expensive disaster if
Mickey doesn't get this cleaned up.</i>

790
00:44:11,968 --> 00:44:13,734
Should I be scared?

791
00:44:15,033 --> 00:44:18,567
I don't think so,
but I like to err on the side of caution.

792
00:44:18,701 --> 00:44:20,200
What does that mean?

793
00:44:20,334 --> 00:44:22,200
It means I'm going to
have to close shop,

794
00:44:22,334 --> 00:44:25,400
shut this farm down
and make it disappear.

795
00:44:25,834 --> 00:44:27,300
You might see
a couple of trucks around here

796
00:44:27,434 --> 00:44:29,167
over the next few days,
but that's it.

797
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:31,400
Well, I'm not gonna pretend
that missing out

798
00:44:31,534 --> 00:44:34,567
on a million pounds commission a
year isn't going to hurt somewhat.

799
00:44:34,701 --> 00:44:36,300
The pain is being shared.

800
00:44:36,434 --> 00:44:39,834
Stolen product,
loss of earnings meantime,

801
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:43,033
the cost of shutting down,
the expense of setting up elsewhere.

802
00:44:43,767 --> 00:44:45,634
It's funny, really, but
it couldn't be worse timing.

803
00:44:45,968 --> 00:44:47,267
How so?

804
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:48,634
I've...

805
00:44:49,801 --> 00:44:52,100
I've just learned we need
a whole new roof apparently.

806
00:44:52,234 --> 00:44:55,534
As I say, I'm as upset
about this as you are.

807
00:45:00,133 --> 00:45:02,200
- Henry.
- Mickey.

808
00:45:02,934 --> 00:45:06,767
<i>The toffs look after Mickey.
Now Mickey looks after the toffs.</i>

809
00:45:07,434 --> 00:45:09,968
<i>But there's a lot of toffs
to look after.</i>

810
00:45:10,801 --> 00:45:12,801
- Henry.
- <i>And when it rains...</i>

811
00:45:12,934 --> 00:45:14,334
Let me take care of the roof.

812
00:45:14,467 --> 00:45:16,701
<i>...it fucking pours.</i>

813
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:20,234
<i>Now, there's only one thing that
needs more looking after than a toff,</i>

814
00:45:20,367 --> 00:45:22,834
<i>and that is
a toff's offspring.</i>

815
00:45:22,968 --> 00:45:26,234
<i>Which brings me neatly back
to Big Dave's story,</i>

816
00:45:26,367 --> 00:45:28,868
<i>the very reason I'm sitting
here sipping whiskey with you</i>

817
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,734
<i>in the first fucking place.</i>

818
00:45:30,868 --> 00:45:34,400
<i>This is how Big Dave
is gonna bring Mickey down,</i>

819
00:45:34,534 --> 00:45:38,701
<i>by using and abusing Lord
Pressfield's much-beloved child.</i>

820
00:45:38,834 --> 00:45:43,634
Lord Pressfield's daughter, the famous and
talented Laura, all self-hate and harm,

821
00:45:43,767 --> 00:45:47,033
has fallen for this Power
Noel's smacked-out dark charm,

822
00:45:47,167 --> 00:45:48,834
and I want the lot of them,

823
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:52,200
especially that
slimy little jam rag Pearson,

824
00:45:52,334 --> 00:45:54,868
in bed with a skint,
discredited toff,

825
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,701
and supplying gear to young
and reckless rock-star royals,

826
00:45:58,834 --> 00:46:01,100
royals unbridled
by distracted parents

827
00:46:01,234 --> 00:46:03,300
too busy skiing
on the Swiss Alps to notice

828
00:46:03,434 --> 00:46:05,167
and too fucking stupid
to care.

829
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:08,000
I like it.
You're good at this, boss.

830
00:46:08,133 --> 00:46:10,133
Yeah, I know what I'm good at,
Hammy. Fuck off.

831
00:46:11,133 --> 00:46:15,701
<i>Aristocratic, junkie, bulimic,
auto-tuned singing daughter</i>

832
00:46:15,834 --> 00:46:18,367
<i>shacked up with some smacked-out,
once-upon-a-time pop star,</i>

833
00:46:18,501 --> 00:46:20,167
<i>and all looked after
by Mickey Pearson.</i>

834
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:23,300
I like it.
You know, I like it a lot.

835
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,667
We wrapped her
in cotton wool.

836
00:46:25,801 --> 00:46:27,701
But she was
our little Lor-la.

837
00:46:29,234 --> 00:46:32,100
Charlie called her that because
she couldn't say Laura at first.

838
00:46:32,801 --> 00:46:34,501
We miss her terribly, Mickey.

839
00:46:35,601 --> 00:46:37,200
I've failed as a parent.

840
00:46:37,334 --> 00:46:39,400
You mustn't keep
beating yourself up, dear.

841
00:46:39,534 --> 00:46:42,400
Anne's right, Charles.
You mustn't blame yourselves.

842
00:46:42,534 --> 00:46:44,434
It sounds as though Laura
fell in with the wrong crowd

843
00:46:44,567 --> 00:46:47,033
at a time when she was
particularly vulnerable.

844
00:46:47,167 --> 00:46:48,767
What more
could we do?

845
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,701
It's happened
to so many of our friends.

846
00:46:51,834 --> 00:46:53,300
It's a curse.

847
00:46:54,634 --> 00:46:57,167
- Do you mind if I look into it?
- So you'll help us?

848
00:46:58,801 --> 00:47:00,334
Let me see what I can do.

849
00:47:04,734 --> 00:47:06,701
You should get yourself
one of these, boss.

850
00:47:06,834 --> 00:47:08,467
Well, that's the plan.

851
00:47:08,601 --> 00:47:10,100
Everything all right?

852
00:47:10,601 --> 00:47:11,934
You remember
their daughter?

853
00:47:12,067 --> 00:47:14,000
Yeah, Laura.
Nice girl. Good voice.

854
00:47:14,133 --> 00:47:17,667
Teeny sort of spunk-funk fuck pop.
Shame about the habit.

855
00:47:17,801 --> 00:47:21,067
She's gone missing. They've asked
us to find her, bring her home.

856
00:47:21,601 --> 00:47:22,567
Mm-hmm.

857
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:24,801
Is that a problem?

858
00:47:24,934 --> 00:47:26,534
Well, I had a feeling
you might ask me this, boss,

859
00:47:26,667 --> 00:47:28,234
so I did some due diligence.

860
00:47:28,367 --> 00:47:30,067
I know where she is
and I don't like it.

861
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:32,501
- I'd rather we didn't get involved.
- Why not?

862
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
<i>She's on
a South London council estate.</i>

863
00:47:35,133 --> 00:47:37,400
- <i>So?</i>
- It's out of our jurisdiction.

864
00:47:37,801 --> 00:47:39,834
There's too many moving parts,
parts that we can't control.

865
00:47:39,968 --> 00:47:41,801
What if she doesn't wanna come?
It's gonna get messy.

866
00:47:41,934 --> 00:47:44,634
Well, that may be true,
but you're still doing it.

867
00:47:45,667 --> 00:47:47,000
I accept that.

868
00:47:48,167 --> 00:47:49,534
But can't you
send Frazier instead?

869
00:47:49,667 --> 00:47:51,367
No, I can't
send Frazier instead.

870
00:47:51,501 --> 00:47:52,834
You're my best man.
I want you.

871
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:01,000
It's just that
I don't like smackies.

872
00:48:01,133 --> 00:48:03,167
It's the filth and the grime
and the grub in the tub.

873
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:06,200
I'm not asking your OCD to spend
the weekend with them, Ray.

874
00:48:07,801 --> 00:48:09,367
Think of it
as philanthropy.

875
00:48:10,834 --> 00:48:12,200
Come on,
you're driving.

876
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:15,534
No good deed
goes unpunished.

877
00:48:15,667 --> 00:48:19,734
And this is where you
have your moment, isn't it, Raymondo?

878
00:48:19,868 --> 00:48:21,534
This is where
you step on stage

879
00:48:21,667 --> 00:48:24,000
and set the dominoes flying
every-fucking-where.

880
00:48:25,133 --> 00:48:26,400
Meaning what?

881
00:48:26,534 --> 00:48:30,067
Meaning no good deed
goes unpunished.

882
00:48:30,501 --> 00:48:31,868
Knock, knock-knock,
knock, knock.

883
00:48:41,033 --> 00:48:42,334
<i>Buenos dias.</i>

884
00:48:43,167 --> 00:48:44,234
Wrong door.

885
00:48:44,367 --> 00:48:45,534
Ah, ah, ah.

886
00:48:46,701 --> 00:48:50,100
My name is Raymond Smith.

887
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:53,133
Can I step inside
for a moment, please?

888
00:48:59,567 --> 00:49:01,100
How can I help you,
Officer?

889
00:49:02,167 --> 00:49:05,367
I'm not the police. No, I just
need a moment of your time.

890
00:49:05,501 --> 00:49:07,501
It's about Laura Pressfield.

891
00:49:08,901 --> 00:49:10,434
I don't know anyone
of that name.

892
00:49:11,234 --> 00:49:13,534
It would be much easier
for all parties concerned

893
00:49:13,667 --> 00:49:15,801
if I could just step inside
for a moment.

894
00:49:16,567 --> 00:49:17,801
No, fuck off.

895
00:49:17,934 --> 00:49:19,767
Jeez.

896
00:49:20,334 --> 00:49:21,801
That's a nice whip, bruv.

897
00:49:22,267 --> 00:49:24,467
Killer motor. It's a shame
about them rims, though.

898
00:49:24,601 --> 00:49:25,901
Yeah, lend us the keys.

899
00:49:26,033 --> 00:49:27,868
Put some chrome twenty-twos
on that.

900
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,367
Hey, my man's got the Dessies
and the bootcuts, you know.

901
00:49:30,501 --> 00:49:32,200
Deffo linking a jessie.

902
00:49:46,968 --> 00:49:48,300
What the fuck?

903
00:49:53,801 --> 00:49:56,334
- What are you doing here?
- Now, now, now.

904
00:49:57,067 --> 00:49:59,634
- Get the fuck out.
- Now, now, now.

905
00:50:05,067 --> 00:50:07,133
As you was, boys and girls.

906
00:50:18,234 --> 00:50:19,501
Sit down.

907
00:50:24,467 --> 00:50:25,667
Thank you.

908
00:50:30,367 --> 00:50:32,467
Shall we have
a little bit of fresh air?

909
00:50:37,667 --> 00:50:39,801
Who the fuck
are your mates, Brown?

910
00:50:39,934 --> 00:50:43,634
No need to get excited, young man.
We will be gone in a few moments.

911
00:50:43,767 --> 00:50:46,334
No, no, no, you'll be gone before then.
Get the fuck out now.

912
00:50:49,501 --> 00:50:51,701
I can be dangerous if I want to be.
Get the fuck out now.

913
00:50:51,834 --> 00:50:55,601
Sit down, Power,
before you get yourself into more trouble.

914
00:50:55,734 --> 00:50:58,133
How d'you know my name? How
the fuck does he know my name?

915
00:50:58,267 --> 00:50:59,868
I know all your names.

916
00:51:00,567 --> 00:51:03,801
Apart from
that little anomaly.

917
00:51:04,667 --> 00:51:06,634
I know where
you went to school.

918
00:51:07,634 --> 00:51:09,601
I know who your parents are.

919
00:51:09,734 --> 00:51:14,267
And I know you'll suck a
cock for a five-pound bag.

920
00:51:18,334 --> 00:51:19,767
Now sit.

921
00:51:28,667 --> 00:51:31,667
Just so we're clear,
I work for a man,

922
00:51:32,334 --> 00:51:33,968
a powerful man.

923
00:51:34,334 --> 00:51:35,300
Michael Pearson.

924
00:51:35,434 --> 00:51:37,000
Ten points to you, Laura.

925
00:51:37,133 --> 00:51:38,467
Who's Michael Pearson?

926
00:51:38,834 --> 00:51:42,000
Friend of her father's.
Runs London's puff game.

927
00:51:42,133 --> 00:51:43,467
A big dick swinger.

928
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:45,300
What is your name,
young man?

929
00:51:46,267 --> 00:51:48,501
- Aslan.
- And where are you from, Aslan?

930
00:51:48,634 --> 00:51:50,567
You don't sound like
one of the natives.

931
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:52,367
Disneyland.

932
00:51:52,501 --> 00:51:54,067
Sounds about right.

933
00:51:54,601 --> 00:51:56,334
Well, you are correct.
He is a big dick swinger.

934
00:51:56,467 --> 00:51:58,801
But I wouldn't want him
to hear you say that.

935
00:51:58,934 --> 00:52:02,667
It's best you forget what he apparently
does for a living after we depart.

936
00:52:03,501 --> 00:52:06,868
Now, Laura, your father's
asked us to bring you home.

937
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,300
She's not going anywhere.

938
00:52:17,667 --> 00:52:18,934
Do you mind if I sit?

939
00:52:19,067 --> 00:52:20,300
Yes.

940
00:52:30,267 --> 00:52:35,501
I don't build a joint like
the Americans and the new school...

941
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:39,968
back-strapping, jockstrapping,
coke-wrapping, and all that bollocks.

942
00:52:40,501 --> 00:52:43,467
I like a good old-fashioned
50-50 mix, me.

943
00:52:43,934 --> 00:52:45,400
That's how we used to play.

944
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,801
If there's one thing
I will never understand,

945
00:52:47,934 --> 00:52:50,033
it's why you lot
get addicted to heroin.

946
00:52:50,634 --> 00:52:54,467
If there's one drug you should not
chase, it is the dirty dragon.

947
00:52:55,367 --> 00:52:56,901
Did you ever
give it a spin, Bunny?

948
00:52:57,033 --> 00:52:59,868
No, not me, Ray.
I don't even puff anymore.

949
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,033
Of course not. Bunny likes the gym.
You can probably see that.

950
00:53:04,934 --> 00:53:07,868
- What are you benching these days?
- Three wheels a side.

951
00:53:08,767 --> 00:53:09,968
What about you, Brown?

952
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:13,601
- What about me?
- What could I lift?

953
00:53:14,267 --> 00:53:16,968
You couldn't lift
a wheel of cheese, you cunt.

954
00:53:20,434 --> 00:53:21,667
Now...

955
00:53:23,567 --> 00:53:25,467
if you wanna be naughty,

956
00:53:25,601 --> 00:53:28,634
what happened to a little smoke
and a poke and a glass of wine,

957
00:53:28,767 --> 00:53:31,000
some Barry White,
candles around the bath

958
00:53:31,133 --> 00:53:32,667
and put your finger
in the missus?

959
00:53:33,467 --> 00:53:34,901
Who's Barry White?

960
00:53:35,534 --> 00:53:36,968
Big black geezer.

961
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:38,367
Sexy voice.

962
00:53:38,501 --> 00:53:40,300
I'm... I'm lost.

963
00:53:40,434 --> 00:53:44,133
Am I in the bath with Barry
White's finger in my missus?

964
00:53:44,534 --> 00:53:48,634
Be quiet, Brown. You were lost
long before Barry White walked in.

965
00:54:00,534 --> 00:54:02,467
If you lot are unhappy,

966
00:54:02,601 --> 00:54:05,133
you should share your thoughts
with your friends.

967
00:54:05,767 --> 00:54:09,000
Nice friends. Talk it out,
find a positive solution.

968
00:54:09,601 --> 00:54:13,667
But, no,
all you lot choose squalor.

969
00:54:14,634 --> 00:54:17,167
Drowning in
your liberal white guilt.

970
00:54:18,234 --> 00:54:19,934
Sorry,
what am I guilty of?

971
00:54:20,067 --> 00:54:22,133
Being a cunt, Brown.

972
00:54:23,467 --> 00:54:25,000
Being a cunt.

973
00:54:26,467 --> 00:54:28,467
Anyway, I'm not your shrink.

974
00:54:28,601 --> 00:54:30,801
I'm just trying to radiate
some positive vibes man to man.

975
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:33,467
I mean, that's what this puff
game used to be all about.

976
00:54:36,934 --> 00:54:38,300
Anyway...

977
00:54:40,467 --> 00:54:41,701
back to you, Laura,

978
00:54:41,834 --> 00:54:45,000
queen in this here
kingdom of shit.

979
00:54:45,601 --> 00:54:49,467
A single rose
in a cauldron of thorns.

980
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:52,834
Are you ready
to turn the corner?

981
00:54:53,834 --> 00:54:56,000
Open the curtains
and let the light in?

982
00:54:56,467 --> 00:54:59,367
Do your mum and dad a favor
and try the impossible,

983
00:54:59,968 --> 00:55:01,801
make yourself happy.

984
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:09,133
All right.

985
00:55:09,834 --> 00:55:12,033
Fucking hell.
That was easy.

986
00:55:13,167 --> 00:55:14,767
All right, fantastic.

987
00:55:14,901 --> 00:55:16,501
Well, in that case, Bunny,

988
00:55:16,634 --> 00:55:18,767
will you help Laura
with her things, please?

989
00:55:18,901 --> 00:55:20,634
Incoming.

990
00:55:20,767 --> 00:55:22,667
It's all right, Bunny.
I don't really have anything.

991
00:55:29,133 --> 00:55:30,834
It's a shithole anyway.

992
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:35,534
Don't go. Please, wait!

993
00:55:38,434 --> 00:55:39,667
Sit down!

994
00:55:41,634 --> 00:55:44,701
Touch me again,
I'll cut your fucking arm off.

995
00:55:47,934 --> 00:55:49,968
It's all right, Bunny.
Keep going.

996
00:55:51,267 --> 00:55:54,634
I just will not be
manhandled by a junkie cunt.

997
00:55:58,934 --> 00:56:03,501
Dave, keep the kids in
school for one minute.

998
00:56:07,901 --> 00:56:09,767
My man
probably wants to buy weed.

999
00:56:09,901 --> 00:56:12,868
- What, da Loud Pack, boss?
- Or the Purple Haze then.

1000
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
My man just pulled out
a donkey choker, bruv.

1001
00:56:15,133 --> 00:56:16,667
Keep your puff.

1002
00:56:17,334 --> 00:56:21,100
Buy yourself a sticky book
and a packet of sweets.

1003
00:56:21,234 --> 00:56:22,334
All-in!

1004
00:56:53,759 --> 00:56:54,993
Now, now, now.

1005
00:56:57,192 --> 00:56:58,726
You cunt.

1006
00:56:59,359 --> 00:57:00,926
Fuck you!

1007
00:57:01,059 --> 00:57:03,759
Hey, that is
a naughty kettle, bruv.

1008
00:57:03,892 --> 00:57:05,158
Hey, what's the time,
Mr. Wolf?

1009
00:57:05,292 --> 00:57:09,258
It's time for you
to fuck off, lads.

1010
00:57:09,392 --> 00:57:11,926
Fucking hit him, Brown!

1011
00:57:15,225 --> 00:57:17,726
Ah. He's bought you a gun.

1012
00:57:17,859 --> 00:57:19,859
That's a nice little gift.

1013
00:57:19,993 --> 00:57:22,258
Five years in prison
all in one little box.

1014
00:57:22,392 --> 00:57:25,258
Oh, but that's not a gun,
dear. That's a paperweight.

1015
00:57:25,392 --> 00:57:29,525
Course it is, along with a
family of six baby bullets.

1016
00:57:30,726 --> 00:57:32,258
Guess we'll have to
get rid of that.

1017
00:57:33,258 --> 00:57:35,292
- Hello, Ray.
- Rosalind.

1018
00:57:35,659 --> 00:57:36,959
Sorry for the interruption.

1019
00:57:37,093 --> 00:57:38,592
What do you need, Ray?

1020
00:57:38,726 --> 00:57:41,225
Laura Pressfield
has been returned home safely.

1021
00:57:47,959 --> 00:57:49,093
Good.

1022
00:57:51,626 --> 00:57:52,759
What else?

1023
00:57:53,792 --> 00:57:55,826
One of her associates
had an accident.

1024
00:57:57,192 --> 00:57:59,659
- Shit.
- He fell out of a window, boss.

1025
00:57:59,792 --> 00:58:01,125
What's the time, Mr. Wolf?

1026
00:58:01,258 --> 00:58:04,759
It's time for you
to fuck off, lads.

1027
00:58:06,892 --> 00:58:08,125
Oh, shit.

1028
00:58:08,258 --> 00:58:09,859
Sounds like
quite an extreme accident.

1029
00:58:09,993 --> 00:58:12,192
Yeah, it was more like
a death, really.

1030
00:58:13,826 --> 00:58:15,859
- Oh, shit.
- Selfie, bruv!

1031
00:58:15,993 --> 00:58:17,125
So you killed someone?

1032
00:58:17,726 --> 00:58:19,792
No. It was the gravity
that killed him.

1033
00:58:20,826 --> 00:58:22,359
- Who was he?
- Aslan.

1034
00:58:22,492 --> 00:58:24,792
Some Russian kid
with tracks on his arms.

1035
00:58:24,926 --> 00:58:26,692
Russian kid?
That doesn't sound good.

1036
00:58:26,826 --> 00:58:27,859
Anyone see you?

1037
00:58:27,993 --> 00:58:29,659
Little selfie? Selfie, bruv?

1038
00:58:29,792 --> 00:58:30,959
Shit.

1039
00:58:31,325 --> 00:58:33,359
Nothing was recorded.
We left it clean.

1040
00:58:33,626 --> 00:58:35,993
- The body?
- I've dealt with that.

1041
00:58:37,726 --> 00:58:40,258
- This is not ideal.
- It is not.

1042
00:58:40,926 --> 00:58:43,459
<i>You can't be fooled
by how those junkies dress.</i>

1043
00:58:44,093 --> 00:58:47,225
- <i>They went to schools, expensive schools.</i>
- Aslan.

1044
00:58:47,359 --> 00:58:49,792
<i>Their parents
have money, lots of money.</i>

1045
00:58:50,959 --> 00:58:52,959
And money can be a problem.

1046
00:58:54,459 --> 00:58:55,959
Shit.

1047
00:58:56,093 --> 00:58:58,826
I bet you told Mickey nothing
about what happened.

1048
00:58:59,359 --> 00:59:02,559
You're fishing, Fletcher,
because you've got no idea.

1049
00:59:02,692 --> 00:59:05,559
You're right, I am fishing.

1050
00:59:05,692 --> 00:59:09,759
Look at this. I'm fishing
in my little baggie.

1051
00:59:10,792 --> 00:59:12,258
And what have I found?

1052
00:59:13,892 --> 00:59:14,959
Oh.

1053
00:59:15,093 --> 00:59:17,359
Thank you.
Or should I say...

1054
00:59:18,258 --> 00:59:19,292
<i>spasibo?</i>

1055
00:59:19,659 --> 00:59:21,093
What's that young man
doing?

1056
00:59:21,225 --> 00:59:23,059
Is he looking for
something on the floor?

1057
00:59:23,559 --> 00:59:24,959
Frazier.

1058
00:59:25,592 --> 00:59:28,093
Lads, we're gonna
need those phones.

1059
00:59:28,759 --> 00:59:30,525
Hey, run. Move, bruv. Move.

1060
00:59:30,659 --> 00:59:32,926
Bunny, get him.
Fucking clean that up.

1061
00:59:33,425 --> 00:59:35,959
- Come on then, catch me, dickhead.
- Little cunt.

1062
01:00:00,359 --> 01:00:01,659
Wanker!

1063
01:00:06,892 --> 01:00:09,659
What you saying now, fam? Huh?
Now I've got backup.

1064
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:13,459
You couldn't back up
a phone, you cunt.

1065
01:00:13,826 --> 01:00:15,759
Bruv, this guy's trying
to take my phone.

1066
01:00:15,892 --> 01:00:18,325
- Fucking do him.
- Back the fuck up!

1067
01:00:18,459 --> 01:00:19,659
How you gonna talk your way
out of this one, mate?

1068
01:00:19,792 --> 01:00:21,258
Easy, lads.

1069
01:00:22,592 --> 01:00:26,192
I'm sure you're all
roadmen, gangsters,

1070
01:00:26,325 --> 01:00:29,592
proper naughty boys
and all that bollocks.

1071
01:00:30,826 --> 01:00:33,026
But I come in peace.

1072
01:00:34,792 --> 01:00:37,826
I'm not trying to steal it.
I'm trying to buy it.

1073
01:00:39,158 --> 01:00:41,993
For good money.
Honest money.

1074
01:00:43,158 --> 01:00:44,892
Yeah? What, this phone?

1075
01:00:47,425 --> 01:00:50,158
- How much?
- A full bag.

1076
01:00:51,059 --> 01:00:54,792
Then I'll be gone,
like the darkness at dawn.

1077
01:00:55,626 --> 01:00:58,592
How about you give us that bag
and be gone anyway?

1078
01:01:05,592 --> 01:01:07,459
Stop fucking around, cunt.

1079
01:01:09,892 --> 01:01:13,792
Give me the phone
and take the money.

1080
01:01:14,425 --> 01:01:16,592
Drop the fucking money
and run, boy.

1081
01:01:24,125 --> 01:01:25,158
Right.

1082
01:01:27,093 --> 01:01:29,993
- Fuck!
- Move, move, move!

1083
01:01:31,726 --> 01:01:32,826
Now...

1084
01:01:34,258 --> 01:01:38,792
put the phone on the ground.

1085
01:01:47,959 --> 01:01:50,292
Ta, ta, ta, ta, ta, ta.

1086
01:02:00,592 --> 01:02:03,225
- Fucking prick.
- What are you doing, Dave?

1087
01:02:03,592 --> 01:02:06,759
- It's on him somewhere.
- I'm trying. Just give me a second. Fuck.

1088
01:02:08,059 --> 01:02:09,225
<i>Ray?</i>

1089
01:02:09,592 --> 01:02:11,792
Can I use your toilet?
Just a pee-pee?

1090
01:02:15,525 --> 01:02:17,826
Fletcher, shoes off inside.

1091
01:02:17,959 --> 01:02:19,859
Leave them by the door.

1092
01:02:19,993 --> 01:02:21,492
Yes, Mommy.

1093
01:02:23,459 --> 01:02:25,492
Come on, bruv.
Where's your pace, brother?

1094
01:02:25,926 --> 01:02:27,492
You can do better than that.

1095
01:02:27,626 --> 01:02:28,826
Wanker.

1096
01:02:29,492 --> 01:02:31,626
Come on, Bunny,
stop fucking about.

1097
01:02:32,292 --> 01:02:34,792
Look at you sweat, bruv.

1098
01:02:34,926 --> 01:02:37,093
Nearly there.
Nearly there. Nearly there.

1099
01:02:37,225 --> 01:02:39,826
Lift those legs up.
Come on, bro.

1100
01:02:39,959 --> 01:02:41,759
You should have brought
your running shoes today, bro.

1101
01:02:41,892 --> 01:02:43,125
Trying out for the Olympics,
are we?

1102
01:02:43,459 --> 01:02:45,859
It's fucking Usain Bolt.
Come on, Usain.

1103
01:02:58,692 --> 01:02:59,726
Phone.

1104
01:03:08,959 --> 01:03:10,292
Sorry about that.

1105
01:03:12,859 --> 01:03:14,258
Can I go home now?

1106
01:03:14,392 --> 01:03:17,192
Course you can, darling.
Course you can.

1107
01:03:38,093 --> 01:03:39,258
Is there a problem here, Ray?

1108
01:03:39,392 --> 01:03:40,692
I don't know.

1109
01:03:41,826 --> 01:03:43,425
Is there a problem here,
Fletcher?

1110
01:03:44,325 --> 01:03:46,125
I see no problem at all.

1111
01:03:47,993 --> 01:03:49,759
I forgot to wash my hands.

1112
01:03:51,459 --> 01:03:52,926
Next time call first.

1113
01:03:53,059 --> 01:03:54,459
Sorry, guv.

1114
01:03:55,959 --> 01:03:57,792
And you haven't
heard a whisper?

1115
01:03:57,926 --> 01:03:59,792
How can so much bush go missing
and nobody know nothing?

1116
01:03:59,926 --> 01:04:02,292
<i>Ah,
I've heard nothing, Coach, honestly.</i>

1117
01:04:02,425 --> 01:04:04,258
<i>Nothing on the street.
But you know what?</i>

1118
01:04:04,392 --> 01:04:06,258
<i>There is this geezer
called Mickey Pearson.</i>

1119
01:04:06,392 --> 01:04:08,459
- Who the fuck is Mickey Pearson?
- <i>Ah, you know him.</i>

1120
01:04:08,592 --> 01:04:10,492
<i>He runs the bush game.
He's a horrible cunt.</i>

1121
01:04:10,626 --> 01:04:12,659
<i>You don't wanna
step on his toes.</i>

1122
01:04:12,792 --> 01:04:14,892
<i>But there's no way your lads
jimmied their way into his car,</i>

1123
01:04:15,026 --> 01:04:16,659
<i>so I wouldn't concern yourself
with that.</i>

1124
01:04:16,792 --> 01:04:18,459
All right, you know
where to find me, Chasa.

1125
01:04:18,592 --> 01:04:19,826
Keep your ear to the ground.

1126
01:04:19,959 --> 01:04:21,559
Primetime, in you get.

1127
01:04:23,292 --> 01:04:24,492
Ernie.

1128
01:04:25,659 --> 01:04:27,125
Did you get
that Chinese fella's name?

1129
01:04:27,258 --> 01:04:28,359
- Phuc.
- What?

1130
01:04:28,492 --> 01:04:30,125
Phuc, like "fuck" with a "Ph."

1131
01:04:30,258 --> 01:04:32,592
Don't get street with me, Ernie.
Where does he live?

1132
01:04:32,726 --> 01:04:34,859
- Posh part of Croydon.
- Drop the rope.

1133
01:04:34,993 --> 01:04:36,626
There is no posh part
of Croydon.

1134
01:04:37,059 --> 01:04:40,826
- It's comparative, innit?
- Oi, Ernie, what are you doing?

1135
01:04:40,959 --> 01:04:42,459
Why aren't you training,
you black cunt?

1136
01:04:42,993 --> 01:04:44,258
I'm on my own here.

1137
01:04:46,425 --> 01:04:47,859
Did he just call me
a black cunt?

1138
01:04:48,292 --> 01:04:50,792
- Yes, he did.
- He can't do that. That's racist.

1139
01:04:50,926 --> 01:04:53,726
But, you are black and you are a
cunt, Ernie. Those are the facts.

1140
01:04:53,859 --> 01:04:55,726
I don't think Primetime cares
what race you run in.

1141
01:04:56,359 --> 01:04:58,826
The fact that I'm black has nothing
to do with the fact I'm a cunt.

1142
01:04:58,959 --> 01:05:01,158
He didn't say black people
were cunts, Ernie.

1143
01:05:01,292 --> 01:05:03,292
He was being specific to you.
One has nothing to do with the other.

1144
01:05:03,425 --> 01:05:04,993
And I'd go a step further,
if I'm not mistaken,

1145
01:05:05,125 --> 01:05:07,125
and say it was a term
of familiar affection.

1146
01:05:07,258 --> 01:05:09,926
Primetime's a Gypsy.
I wouldn't call him a pikey cunt.

1147
01:05:10,059 --> 01:05:12,059
Why not? He might be
very understanding.

1148
01:05:12,192 --> 01:05:13,626
Only if it comes from
a place of love, of course.

1149
01:05:13,759 --> 01:05:15,392
Now, back to
the issue at hand.

1150
01:05:15,525 --> 01:05:17,626
I need that Chinese
geezer's address, okay?

1151
01:05:17,759 --> 01:05:19,325
You'll have it
by the morning, Coach.

1152
01:05:19,459 --> 01:05:21,292
- Good lad.
- And, Coach...

1153
01:05:21,425 --> 01:05:22,993
- What?
- I've got some good news.

1154
01:05:23,125 --> 01:05:25,459
- What?
- I found out whose weed we took.

1155
01:05:27,325 --> 01:05:29,292
And now
you fucking tell me!

1156
01:05:30,225 --> 01:05:31,626
Did I say stop?

1157
01:05:33,125 --> 01:05:35,792
Ernie, this is not
the fucking time

1158
01:05:35,926 --> 01:05:38,026
to keep your cards
close to your chest.

1159
01:05:39,125 --> 01:05:41,192
Just tell me his name
isn't Mickey Pearson.

1160
01:05:41,325 --> 01:05:43,425
Blimey, Coach,
are you a Gypsy too?

1161
01:05:43,559 --> 01:05:45,192
You been reading tea leaves,
got a crystal ball?

1162
01:05:45,325 --> 01:05:47,459
That is not good news,
Ernie.

1163
01:05:47,592 --> 01:05:51,158
Mickey Pearson is terrible news in the
face of a violent and expensive debt.

1164
01:06:00,192 --> 01:06:01,626
I'm here
to see your boss.

1165
01:06:08,726 --> 01:06:10,158
Feel free to talk.

1166
01:06:10,792 --> 01:06:11,992
I gather you're the
consigliere of the outfit

1167
01:06:11,994 --> 01:06:14,158
that my boys were stupid
enough to fuck around with.

1168
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:17,793
On that note, I'd like to extend
my apologies on their behalf.

1169
01:06:18,567 --> 01:06:20,167
My boys, they're naive,

1170
01:06:20,734 --> 01:06:22,767
they've had hard lives and they're
just starting to come good,

1171
01:06:22,900 --> 01:06:25,800
but they're my lads,
my responsibility,

1172
01:06:26,167 --> 01:06:28,334
so it's me that should be
accountable for their actions.

1173
01:06:28,867 --> 01:06:32,533
Now, I can return your goods,
but I can't return the inconvenience,

1174
01:06:32,667 --> 01:06:34,734
the time,
the fucking headache.

1175
01:06:35,633 --> 01:06:40,734
And so I offer you my loyalty,
my word, my time,

1176
01:06:41,167 --> 01:06:43,034
until that debt is settled.

1177
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:49,700
I'll make amends,
but just leave me lads alone.

1178
01:06:51,767 --> 01:06:55,101
First of all, I'm gonna need to know
how your lads got the information

1179
01:06:55,234 --> 01:06:57,201
about where our farm
was sited,

1180
01:06:57,600 --> 01:06:59,368
'cause that's not
common knowledge.

1181
01:07:00,567 --> 01:07:04,767
Once we've overcome that little
challenge, then we can talk.

1182
01:07:06,900 --> 01:07:09,034
Well, I can do
better than that.

1183
01:07:16,533 --> 01:07:19,967
His name is Phuc, but it's spelled with
a "Ph," so it sounds like "fu-uck."

1184
01:07:22,067 --> 01:07:23,633
So it's Phu-uc?

1185
01:07:23,767 --> 01:07:25,834
What?
Yeah, something like that.

1186
01:07:25,967 --> 01:07:29,800
Anyway, he's the kid that gave us
the skunk farm job. Do you know him?

1187
01:07:29,934 --> 01:07:32,834
Yeah, we've met before,
haven't we, Phu-uc... Phuc?

1188
01:07:32,967 --> 01:07:34,034
That's the one.
Phu-uc?

1189
01:07:34,167 --> 01:07:36,167
- Phuc.
- Phuc.

1190
01:07:37,667 --> 01:07:38,800
All right.

1191
01:07:39,301 --> 01:07:41,001
Don't do anything stupid, now,
son, right?

1192
01:07:43,967 --> 01:07:45,567
How did you know
the location?

1193
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:47,201
I need my inhaler.

1194
01:07:47,334 --> 01:07:48,734
Yeah, in a minute.

1195
01:07:49,368 --> 01:07:52,500
I need you to tell me how you
knew the location of our farm.

1196
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:57,167
I've been trailing you for months.
Dry Eye was given the address.

1197
01:07:58,134 --> 01:08:00,600
I can't breathe!
I need it, please.

1198
01:08:00,734 --> 01:08:03,633
All right, Phuc.
Calm the fu-uck down.

1199
01:08:06,167 --> 01:08:08,767
Right, here, steady yourself.
For fuck's sake.

1200
01:08:10,734 --> 01:08:12,134
Sort him out.

1201
01:08:12,767 --> 01:08:14,468
All right.

1202
01:08:15,934 --> 01:08:17,167
Here, here, look at me.

1203
01:08:17,834 --> 01:08:19,101
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1204
01:08:19,234 --> 01:08:20,867
- Where's your inhaler?
- There.

1205
01:08:22,434 --> 01:08:24,633
Right, here, take a blim.

1206
01:08:24,767 --> 01:08:28,401
Now, good boy. There you go, son.
You all right?

1207
01:08:31,334 --> 01:08:32,368
Fuck!

1208
01:08:33,468 --> 01:08:34,533
No, stop, don't!

1209
01:08:42,334 --> 01:08:45,334
Fuck's sake, Ray. You need
to invest in some parachutes.

1210
01:08:45,767 --> 01:08:47,468
There's a pattern
emerging here.

1211
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:48,967
I'm sorry, boss.

1212
01:08:49,101 --> 01:08:51,201
And who's this
jumping Phuc boy, anyway?

1213
01:08:51,334 --> 01:08:53,834
- It's Dry Eye's man.
- You mean Lord George's man.

1214
01:08:54,368 --> 01:08:57,900
It could just be Dry Eye's doing.
He's been getting bold lately.

1215
01:08:58,034 --> 01:09:01,368
Yeah. Well,
they still all work for Lord George.

1216
01:09:02,567 --> 01:09:04,267
I'm gonna take care
of this one myself.

1217
01:09:32,301 --> 01:09:33,401
Lord George.

1218
01:09:34,001 --> 01:09:35,368
Mr. Pearson.

1219
01:09:36,834 --> 01:09:38,334
And to what do I owe?

1220
01:09:50,167 --> 01:09:51,234
What you watching?

1221
01:09:52,533 --> 01:09:54,034
I'm watching the telly.

1222
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:56,334
What you watching
on the telly?

1223
01:09:56,468 --> 01:09:58,967
I'm watching
the horse racing.

1224
01:09:59,434 --> 01:10:02,867
Live satellite
from Hong Kong.

1225
01:10:03,834 --> 01:10:05,434
My only vice.

1226
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:07,934
Well, that's not
strictly true, is it?

1227
01:10:08,434 --> 01:10:10,101
Meaning?

1228
01:10:10,234 --> 01:10:13,700
Meaning I've always taken vice
to be the definition

1229
01:10:13,834 --> 01:10:16,800
of any criminal activity
or wicked behavior

1230
01:10:16,934 --> 01:10:19,700
involving prostitution,
pornography or drugs,

1231
01:10:19,834 --> 01:10:22,101
so, no...

1232
01:10:23,167 --> 01:10:26,468
racing is definitely not
your only vice, your lordship.

1233
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:29,533
I'd say you're eyebrows deep
in every vice known to man.

1234
01:10:29,667 --> 01:10:31,767
- There is a difference.
- Being?

1235
01:10:32,401 --> 01:10:38,734
I facilitate. I don't participate
in any of the aforementioned vices.

1236
01:10:41,301 --> 01:10:42,401
What about tea?

1237
01:10:53,167 --> 01:10:54,533
What about tea?

1238
01:10:54,667 --> 01:10:57,800
Well, that too is a vice.

1239
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:00,667
Caffeine is a drug,
don't you know?

1240
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:04,633
So is that what you're here
to talk to me about? Tea?

1241
01:11:04,767 --> 01:11:08,567
Sweet Mary Jane is my vice
of choice, as you well know.

1242
01:11:09,001 --> 01:11:12,267
Of course, I'm addicted to
selling it, not consuming it.

1243
01:11:12,633 --> 01:11:15,867
I specifically chose
to deal in marijuana.

1244
01:11:16,301 --> 01:11:18,201
Sure, I could see
there was more to be made

1245
01:11:18,334 --> 01:11:21,934
in shifting the white or the brown
powder, as you so chose,

1246
01:11:22,067 --> 01:11:26,600
but, you see, my jam,
it doesn't kill anyone,

1247
01:11:27,001 --> 01:11:28,700
and I like that.

1248
01:11:31,101 --> 01:11:32,767
<i>While your poison...</i>

1249
01:11:33,934 --> 01:11:38,567
is and always has been
a destroyer of worlds.

1250
01:11:46,767 --> 01:11:51,834
So, yes, your facilitation is
most definitely participation.

1251
01:12:02,001 --> 01:12:05,034
But I'm not here to give you a
sermon on situational ethics.

1252
01:12:05,633 --> 01:12:08,434
So why the fuck
are you here?

1253
01:12:25,633 --> 01:12:27,667
You're starting a war
with me, George,

1254
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:29,500
and I'm trying to moonwalk
with elegance here,

1255
01:12:29,633 --> 01:12:31,533
but I'm finding it
very fucking difficult.

1256
01:12:31,667 --> 01:12:33,201
Laura!

1257
01:12:33,334 --> 01:12:35,001
<i>I don't fuck around with puff.</i>

1258
01:12:35,134 --> 01:12:37,167
You send your man Dry Eye
around my place

1259
01:12:37,301 --> 01:12:39,134
to see if he can buy
my business for a few beans.

1260
01:12:39,267 --> 01:12:40,334
Laura!

1261
01:12:42,533 --> 01:12:44,401
<i>You didn't
think I'd find out?</i>

1262
01:12:44,533 --> 01:12:46,401
Having me followed
for months?

1263
01:12:47,667 --> 01:12:49,967
Yeah. You crossed the line,

1264
01:12:50,101 --> 01:12:51,667
<i>and that comes
with a price.</i>

1265
01:12:52,267 --> 01:12:54,201
You raided
one of my locations.

1266
01:12:54,934 --> 01:12:56,700
You know the rules,
George.

1267
01:12:57,500 --> 01:12:59,001
What the fuck
were you thinking?

1268
01:12:59,134 --> 01:13:00,967
You raided one of
my locations.

1269
01:13:01,101 --> 01:13:02,967
<i>What the fuck
were you thinking?</i>

1270
01:13:03,334 --> 01:13:05,368
What the fuck
were you thinking, George?

1271
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:44,700
Should you
try and undermine me,

1272
01:13:45,434 --> 01:13:48,167
or should you attempt
to threaten my position again,

1273
01:13:48,301 --> 01:13:50,900
I will be forced to accept
your call to arms.

1274
01:13:51,034 --> 01:13:52,234
Do you understand?

1275
01:13:54,700 --> 01:13:55,800
Good.

1276
01:13:57,167 --> 01:14:00,834
Now, I can see you're feeling
somewhat under the weather.

1277
01:14:01,334 --> 01:14:03,034
<i>That's because
I spiked your tea</i>

1278
01:14:03,167 --> 01:14:05,967
<i>with a nasty little parasitic
genus called shigella.</i>

1279
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:10,301
Left unattended, you will shit yourself
to death before the sun doth set.

1280
01:14:12,067 --> 01:14:14,034
I suggest taking
two of these fizzy biscuits.

1281
01:14:16,500 --> 01:14:18,201
You'll be fine
in an hour or two,

1282
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:21,101
long enough to consider
your past indiscretions.

1283
01:14:27,001 --> 01:14:30,700
And, George, if I can get to
you in your own kitchen...

1284
01:14:32,334 --> 01:14:33,434
I can get to you anywhere.

1285
01:14:41,633 --> 01:14:44,301
- Did you do it?
- Do what?

1286
01:14:44,434 --> 01:14:46,900
Did you raid
Mickey Pearson's farm?

1287
01:14:47,034 --> 01:14:51,134
- No.
- So you're telling me that Phuc did this behind your back.

1288
01:14:52,001 --> 01:14:54,767
Well, let's just say this.
He didn't do it in front of it.

1289
01:14:55,533 --> 01:14:56,633
He did it
without my blessing.

1290
01:14:56,767 --> 01:14:58,334
But you did go behind my back

1291
01:14:58,468 --> 01:15:00,234
and offer to buy his business.

1292
01:15:02,267 --> 01:15:04,900
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

1293
01:15:07,334 --> 01:15:09,567
Now, let me warn you
the way you warn me.

1294
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:14,368
There comes a point where
the young succeed the old.

1295
01:15:15,468 --> 01:15:16,633
Don't push me.

1296
01:15:21,134 --> 01:15:22,767
There are some things
I don't know about.

1297
01:15:22,900 --> 01:15:26,001
Something between Dry Eye
and Lord George.

1298
01:15:26,134 --> 01:15:31,434
Now, whatever it was,
someone killed Lord George.

1299
01:15:31,900 --> 01:15:36,334
Anyone else might think
that was you or Mickey.

1300
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:40,934
Shall we continue
with our little story?

1301
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:44,667
Does that arouse
your interest, Raymond?

1302
01:15:45,301 --> 01:15:46,800
So Matthew knows Dry Eye.

1303
01:15:48,134 --> 01:15:50,167
- So what?
- Well, yes, I agree.

1304
01:15:50,301 --> 01:15:51,667
Perhaps they were
just meeting up

1305
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:53,401
to talk about holidaying
in the Maldives

1306
01:15:53,533 --> 01:15:57,368
or the long-term implications
of leaving the EU.

1307
01:15:57,500 --> 01:16:02,368
But I filmed it, had it lip-read,
translated and transcribed.

1308
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:05,468
Rather like the classic
1974 film <i>The Conversation,</i>

1309
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:07,967
starring Gene Hackman
and John Cazale.

1310
01:16:08,101 --> 01:16:11,401
You know, Coppola slipped that
one out between the <i>Godfathers.</i>

1311
01:16:11,967 --> 01:16:14,301
It wasn't really for me.
It's a bit boring, to be honest.

1312
01:16:14,434 --> 01:16:19,434
Now, can I just say, that Matthew,
he's quite something, isn't he?

1313
01:16:19,567 --> 01:16:21,533
He's not
your average American.

1314
01:16:21,667 --> 01:16:24,967
He's a Mr. International.
Even speaks a bit of Cantonese.

1315
01:16:25,101 --> 01:16:30,468
Come here. You play Dry Eye
and I shall be Matthew.

1316
01:16:32,067 --> 01:16:33,267
Come on.

1317
01:16:37,934 --> 01:16:40,700
All right.

1318
01:16:41,934 --> 01:16:43,600
Try and get it in time
with his lips, all right?

1319
01:16:43,734 --> 01:16:45,334
- Yeah, yeah.
- Ready?

1320
01:16:46,434 --> 01:16:47,633
Roll camera. Action.

1321
01:17:00,967 --> 01:17:03,334
<i>There was an incident.
Lord George...</i>

1322
01:17:03,468 --> 01:17:04,567
<i>Fuck's sake, Raymond.</i>

1323
01:17:04,700 --> 01:17:06,234
It's a bit fucking wooden.

1324
01:17:06,368 --> 01:17:08,234
Put something into it,
you know, a bit of welly.

1325
01:17:08,767 --> 01:17:10,201
And action.

1326
01:17:10,334 --> 01:17:11,700
There was an incident.

1327
01:17:11,834 --> 01:17:13,500
Lord George
didn't come through it.

1328
01:17:13,633 --> 01:17:15,201
Didn't come through it?

1329
01:17:15,334 --> 01:17:17,700
The last thing you need to do
is attract any octopus.

1330
01:17:17,834 --> 01:17:19,134
Octopus?

1331
01:17:20,401 --> 01:17:23,167
What does that mean?
It's not a very good translation.

1332
01:17:23,301 --> 01:17:24,867
No, there's nothing wrong
with the translation.

1333
01:17:25,001 --> 01:17:26,667
Matthew's not that fluent.
And it's Cantonese.

1334
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:28,334
Just go with it
and fill in the blanks.

1335
01:17:28,468 --> 01:17:29,800
And action.

1336
01:17:30,434 --> 01:17:32,500
<i>It's all on Michael.
He's to blame.</i>

1337
01:17:33,267 --> 01:17:34,667
<i>That is not a smart move.</i>

1338
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:36,767
Don't tell me
what a smart move is.

1339
01:17:36,900 --> 01:17:38,034
<i>I beg for your pardon.</i>

1340
01:17:38,167 --> 01:17:39,867
You heard me
perfectly well.

1341
01:17:40,001 --> 01:17:42,533
<i>There will be repercussions
for Michael's actions.</i>

1342
01:17:42,667 --> 01:17:44,301
You think you're
running things, do you?

1343
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:46,700
<i>Don't stroke my mouse hair.</i>

1344
01:17:47,967 --> 01:17:51,067
- What does "mouse hair" mean?
- Yeah, I think what he means is don't jeopardize my deal,

1345
01:17:51,201 --> 01:17:53,034
but I admit that one's
a bit of a googly.

1346
01:17:53,167 --> 01:17:54,834
Then Matthew loses it a bit

1347
01:17:54,967 --> 01:17:57,301
and his translation goes
completely out of the window.

1348
01:17:57,434 --> 01:18:00,234
Something about springtime
and sweaters.

1349
01:18:00,368 --> 01:18:01,867
I think what he means
is he's upset.

1350
01:18:02,001 --> 01:18:03,368
<i>And then Dry Eye
says something,</i>

1351
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:05,001
<i>but some cunt
moved in front of me,</i>

1352
01:18:05,134 --> 01:18:06,468
<i>so I didn't get that
either.</i>

1353
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:08,667
Your Cantonese
is dog shit,

1354
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:09,867
so I'm gonna say this
in English

1355
01:18:10,001 --> 01:18:11,034
and I'm gonna say it once,

1356
01:18:11,167 --> 01:18:12,867
so listen to me,
Rubenstein.

1357
01:18:15,434 --> 01:18:17,167
This is how
it's gonna play out.

1358
01:18:18,533 --> 01:18:20,201
You're gonna
back the fuck off...

1359
01:18:21,167 --> 01:18:22,867
and I'm gonna
take it all.

1360
01:18:24,167 --> 01:18:26,900
And you will pay me
my respect.

1361
01:18:28,001 --> 01:18:30,234
And there you have it.
That's all I've got.

1362
01:18:30,368 --> 01:18:33,201
Sorry. Show's over.

1363
01:18:33,334 --> 01:18:36,001
But I think
it's quite clear

1364
01:18:36,134 --> 01:18:38,567
that they're not just
mah-jongg partners, are they?

1365
01:18:39,134 --> 01:18:40,201
Mm?

1366
01:18:47,767 --> 01:18:50,201
Not all of that
was clear, Fletcher.

1367
01:18:50,334 --> 01:18:51,967
I mean,
according to you,

1368
01:18:52,101 --> 01:18:54,434
we already know Matthew
wants to buy Michael out.

1369
01:18:55,468 --> 01:18:58,934
- So why is that news?
- Oh, don't you worry, my darling.

1370
01:18:59,067 --> 01:19:00,867
We are gonna
come to the news.

1371
01:19:01,567 --> 01:19:04,267
<i>I'm approaching my climax.</i>

1372
01:19:10,967 --> 01:19:12,267
Dry Eye.

1373
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:16,101
I trust you will make
Michael Pearson pay for this.

1374
01:19:16,967 --> 01:19:18,934
You are
the dragon head now.

1375
01:19:19,067 --> 01:19:20,834
Solidify your position.

1376
01:19:22,301 --> 01:19:23,633
It will be done, Uncle.

1377
01:19:24,734 --> 01:19:27,600
<i>So Dry Eye got the upgrade
he was after, didn't he, Raymond?</i>

1378
01:19:27,734 --> 01:19:30,167
<i>The question is,
what was he gonna do with it</i>

1379
01:19:30,301 --> 01:19:32,301
<i>now that he's
Billy Big Bollocks?</i>

1380
01:19:32,434 --> 01:19:34,034
Give me ten minutes,
Ray.

1381
01:19:35,167 --> 01:19:36,201
Boss.

1382
01:19:50,101 --> 01:19:51,434
Hello, Ros.

1383
01:19:51,567 --> 01:19:53,567
It's date night tonight,

1384
01:19:53,700 --> 01:19:56,468
9:00 p.m., you and I,
River Cafe.

1385
01:19:56,600 --> 01:19:58,867
Nine o'clock? I'll be there.

1386
01:20:02,667 --> 01:20:04,234
We're closed.

1387
01:20:04,368 --> 01:20:05,500
Hang up.

1388
01:20:07,334 --> 01:20:08,368
No.

1389
01:20:08,934 --> 01:20:10,034
<i>Hang the fucking phone up.</i>

1390
01:20:10,167 --> 01:20:11,201
Who's there?

1391
01:20:13,167 --> 01:20:14,700
Ros, who's there?

1392
01:20:15,034 --> 01:20:16,201
<i>What you doing here,
Dry Eye?</i>

1393
01:20:20,201 --> 01:20:22,034
It's warming up now,
isn't it?

1394
01:20:22,167 --> 01:20:25,867
At this point, I'm guessing
that you didn't even know

1395
01:20:26,001 --> 01:20:28,034
that Lord George
was dead yet,

1396
01:20:28,167 --> 01:20:30,533
let alone
what Dry Eye was up to.

1397
01:20:30,667 --> 01:20:33,134
Hello, Dry Eye.
What do you want?

1398
01:20:45,533 --> 01:20:46,633
Fancy a boiled sweet?

1399
01:20:47,301 --> 01:20:49,834
- No.
- Suit yourself.

1400
01:20:58,134 --> 01:20:59,468
Who the fuck was he?

1401
01:20:59,967 --> 01:21:01,767
<i>I'm not exactly
sure what happened next,</i>

1402
01:21:01,900 --> 01:21:04,334
<i>because you two managed
to give me the slip.</i>

1403
01:21:04,468 --> 01:21:06,500
They got Rosalind.
Call Roger.

1404
01:21:08,167 --> 01:21:10,368
Oh, goody. Another bottle.

1405
01:21:10,500 --> 01:21:12,633
Hold on. You were there?

1406
01:21:15,334 --> 01:21:17,368
Yeah.
Of course I was there.

1407
01:21:18,101 --> 01:21:21,468
He's not picking up. Maybe you
should put your seat belt on.

1408
01:21:22,633 --> 01:21:24,633
Yeah, let me call Rosalind.
Let me do it.

1409
01:21:26,134 --> 01:21:28,301
I got it.
Just watch the road.

1410
01:21:29,134 --> 01:21:30,967
Now, Rosalind, don't be alarmed,

1411
01:21:31,101 --> 01:21:32,800
but you're gonna
come with me

1412
01:21:32,934 --> 01:21:35,167
until I can resolve all these
issues with your husband.

1413
01:21:35,934 --> 01:21:37,334
I'm not going anywhere.

1414
01:21:38,134 --> 01:21:40,001
She's not picking up.
It's just ringing.

1415
01:21:40,134 --> 01:21:42,934
- Fuck.
- We could just slow down a little bit.

1416
01:21:44,767 --> 01:21:46,134
Fuck!

1417
01:22:00,834 --> 01:22:02,468
<i>You know how it works.</i>

1418
01:22:03,167 --> 01:22:06,667
You either come with me or Tony
here is gonna make you come with me.

1419
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:09,500
You're in my office
under my roof.

1420
01:22:09,633 --> 01:22:11,401
It's not your position
for Tony to do anything

1421
01:22:11,533 --> 01:22:13,867
other than to fuck off back
from whence he came.

1422
01:22:14,001 --> 01:22:15,633
Tony.

1423
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:20,201
What's that?
Is that a paperweight?

1424
01:22:20,334 --> 01:22:23,834
Funny you should say that. Turns out
anything with weight can be a paperweight.

1425
01:22:23,967 --> 01:22:26,134
- What are you gonna do with it?
- Well, that's up to you, isn't it?

1426
01:22:26,267 --> 01:22:28,633
Either you do as I tell
you to and use the door,

1427
01:22:28,767 --> 01:22:31,167
or I'm gonna shoot fat Tony
right between the eyes.

1428
01:22:31,301 --> 01:22:33,301
You see, this gun's
only got two bullets,

1429
01:22:33,434 --> 01:22:35,867
so I'm not gonna fuck about
illustrating its significance.

1430
01:22:36,001 --> 01:22:37,734
You're gonna have to
trust me on that.

1431
01:22:37,867 --> 01:22:39,667
The alternative
is a little bit absolute.

1432
01:22:40,934 --> 01:22:42,834
I'm gonna have
to check your grammar on that.

1433
01:22:43,301 --> 01:22:45,468
It can't be
just a little bit absolute.

1434
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:48,067
It either is or it isn't.

1435
01:22:48,201 --> 01:22:51,301
Whatever it is,
I've lost my patience.

1436
01:22:51,434 --> 01:22:55,301
I'm telling you, I will squeeze this
trigger and Tony will be no more.

1437
01:22:55,434 --> 01:22:57,301
Tony.

1438
01:22:58,667 --> 01:23:01,201
Listen to me, cunt.
You take one step forward,

1439
01:23:01,334 --> 01:23:03,167
it'll be the last fucking
step you ever take.

1440
01:23:03,301 --> 01:23:04,667
Tony, get on it.

1441
01:23:39,967 --> 01:23:41,368
I fucking dare you.

1442
01:23:44,067 --> 01:23:45,167
Just calm down.

1443
01:23:46,267 --> 01:23:47,301
I'm leaving.

1444
01:23:54,967 --> 01:23:56,434
I guess that's
your two bullets, eh?

1445
01:23:57,401 --> 01:23:58,700
Rosalind!

1446
01:24:12,633 --> 01:24:14,001
Rosalind!

1447
01:24:20,500 --> 01:24:22,201
Stay fucking still!

1448
01:24:29,468 --> 01:24:30,401
Hello, babe.

1449
01:24:47,267 --> 01:24:48,334
Hello, love.

1450
01:24:49,001 --> 01:24:51,234
<i>So you're
basing your whole crescendo</i>

1451
01:24:51,767 --> 01:24:53,401
on a figment
of your imagination.

1452
01:24:53,533 --> 01:24:57,301
I'm basing my whole crescendo
on the sum of its parts.

1453
01:24:57,434 --> 01:24:59,667
A few minor details aside,
I wouldn't have any trouble at all

1454
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:03,767
selling this juicy peach
of a drama to Big Dave.

1455
01:25:03,900 --> 01:25:05,800
He'd cream
his fucking panties.

1456
01:25:05,934 --> 01:25:08,600
You're too smart to be
blackmailing us, Fletcher.

1457
01:25:08,734 --> 01:25:11,434
Yes, yes, and obviously I've
taken precautionary measures.

1458
01:25:11,734 --> 01:25:15,134
You can do all kinds of
horrible things to me if you want.

1459
01:25:15,633 --> 01:25:17,434
I might even enjoy them.

1460
01:25:17,567 --> 01:25:20,167
But you'd have to leave the
country and never come back.

1461
01:25:20,301 --> 01:25:22,267
So is that the story over
now, Fletcher?

1462
01:25:22,401 --> 01:25:26,101
All this, this whole buildup,
was leading to this next part.

1463
01:25:26,234 --> 01:25:29,468
This is the news that
you were asking about before.

1464
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:31,034
Ready?

1465
01:25:31,633 --> 01:25:32,667
Matthew.

1466
01:25:33,500 --> 01:25:35,301
<i>He's gonna need some people
to run his business here</i>

1467
01:25:35,434 --> 01:25:37,334
<i>when he buys it
from Michael, right?</i>

1468
01:25:37,468 --> 01:25:40,267
He's gonna need a reliable pair of
hands, someone like you.

1469
01:25:40,401 --> 01:25:42,368
Hmm. So why didn't he
ask you, Raymond?

1470
01:25:42,500 --> 01:25:44,867
I don't know.
It's none of my business.

1471
01:25:45,001 --> 01:25:46,533
Because, I'll tell you,

1472
01:25:47,167 --> 01:25:49,667
he already had someone
earmarked for the role.

1473
01:25:50,468 --> 01:25:53,600
<i>Dry Eye.
He promised Dry Eye the job,</i>

1474
01:25:53,734 --> 01:25:57,500
but only if Dry Eye helped drive
down the price of Mickey's business.

1475
01:25:57,633 --> 01:26:02,001
You see, it was Matthew who told Dry
Eye the location of Mickey's farm,

1476
01:26:02,134 --> 01:26:04,500
<i>so he could steal
his white widow super cheese</i>

1477
01:26:04,633 --> 01:26:06,900
to cause ripples
and reduce the market value.

1478
01:26:07,034 --> 01:26:09,700
And that is why Phuc,
in turn,

1479
01:26:09,834 --> 01:26:14,067
<i>got those juice-swilling,
acne-backed muscle Marys to do the job.</i>

1480
01:26:14,201 --> 01:26:16,067
<i>It was Matthew</i>

1481
01:26:16,201 --> 01:26:18,967
who set this whole
train of events off.

1482
01:26:19,767 --> 01:26:22,034
<i>But what he did not
plan on, you see...</i>

1483
01:26:22,167 --> 01:26:23,867
Fuck you,
you old cunt!

1484
01:26:24,001 --> 01:26:25,301
I'll piss on your grave.

1485
01:26:27,967 --> 01:26:29,567
<i>...was Dry Eye...</i>

1486
01:26:31,468 --> 01:26:32,700
killing Lord George.

1487
01:26:34,167 --> 01:26:37,800
<i>Now, Dry Eye does not want to be
subservient to Matthew anymore.</i>

1488
01:26:37,934 --> 01:26:39,334
Doesn't wanna be
subservient to anyone.

1489
01:26:39,468 --> 01:26:41,234
This is how
it's gonna play out.

1490
01:26:42,767 --> 01:26:44,567
You're gonna
back the fuck off

1491
01:26:45,101 --> 01:26:47,067
and I'm gonna
take it all.

1492
01:26:47,201 --> 01:26:50,900
Dry Eye likes the smell of
power and does not like Matthew.

1493
01:26:51,034 --> 01:26:55,401
<i>So, the little dragon needed a gentle
reminder of who was really running things.</i>

1494
01:26:55,533 --> 01:26:57,567
You've been in this paddling
pool for two minutes.

1495
01:26:57,700 --> 01:27:00,533
I've been swimming in the ocean
with the sharks for 20 years.

1496
01:27:00,667 --> 01:27:03,234
I'll tell you
how this plays out.

1497
01:27:03,967 --> 01:27:05,468
You will drown...

1498
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:09,334
and then my Mossad crabs
will eat you.

1499
01:27:09,468 --> 01:27:14,334
And this, my love, is why I want
my hard-earned 20 million pounds.

1500
01:27:14,468 --> 01:27:20,500
Because not only do I know exactly
how Mickey's business operates,

1501
01:27:20,633 --> 01:27:24,934
but I also know that the very
man he's trying to sell it to

1502
01:27:25,067 --> 01:27:27,700
is trying to force him
into selling it on the cheap

1503
01:27:27,834 --> 01:27:30,767
and has indirectly
started a war.

1504
01:27:31,468 --> 01:27:34,800
So, you see, I think you should be
calling me your trusted consigliere,

1505
01:27:35,767 --> 01:27:37,301
or your spy
behind the lines,

1506
01:27:37,434 --> 01:27:41,434
your intellectual
reconnaissance, if you prefer.

1507
01:27:42,934 --> 01:27:44,334
I'm impressed.

1508
01:27:45,567 --> 01:27:47,767
You certainly know
more than I do.

1509
01:27:47,900 --> 01:27:50,633
I'm impressed not only
by your information,

1510
01:27:50,767 --> 01:27:52,867
but by your imagination.

1511
01:27:53,633 --> 01:27:54,867
Thank you very much.

1512
01:27:57,468 --> 01:27:59,267
So you've got 72 hours.

1513
01:28:00,301 --> 01:28:03,500
And I would just reiterate
that if anything happens to me,

1514
01:28:03,633 --> 01:28:05,967
I do have my insurance policy
in place.

1515
01:28:06,434 --> 01:28:09,201
Everything will go to Big Dave,
and from him to the public,

1516
01:28:09,334 --> 01:28:11,301
and you, my love,
will go to Mars.

1517
01:28:11,434 --> 01:28:14,500
So, strong recommendation,
just pay up

1518
01:28:14,633 --> 01:28:20,167
and watch me recede into the
sunset blowing kisses, yes?

1519
01:28:23,201 --> 01:28:27,368
Well, then, time to use the
door, you black bastard.

1520
01:28:27,500 --> 01:28:29,834
Well, that's just silly, isn't
it, 'cause I'm not black.

1521
01:28:29,967 --> 01:28:32,834
No, but your fucking soul is,
you dark cunt.

1522
01:28:35,034 --> 01:28:38,134
Now, out of my house,
'cause I'm going to bed.

1523
01:28:40,633 --> 01:28:42,134
Can I come with you?

1524
01:28:43,500 --> 01:28:47,533
No, but you can go smoke the exhaust
pipe in the back of your hearse.

1525
01:28:49,201 --> 01:28:50,633
I might come anyway.

1526
01:28:52,201 --> 01:28:54,834
You'll just hear me
scratching about in the dark,

1527
01:28:55,533 --> 01:28:57,301
wanking into a hanky.

1528
01:29:02,500 --> 01:29:05,034
All right, so, 20 million.

1529
01:29:06,167 --> 01:29:08,067
You've got 72 hours,
starting now.

1530
01:29:09,001 --> 01:29:11,667
Ticktock, ticktock.

1531
01:29:13,201 --> 01:29:14,434
And I'm gone.

1532
01:29:17,468 --> 01:29:19,001
Ticktock.

1533
01:29:23,001 --> 01:29:24,700
Ticktock.

1534
01:29:34,434 --> 01:29:36,101
He's just left.

1535
01:29:36,234 --> 01:29:37,834
He thinks he's very clever.

1536
01:29:38,600 --> 01:29:40,034
Start with Big Dave.

1537
01:29:45,234 --> 01:29:47,334
Now, you keep this
between you and me, Hammy,

1538
01:29:47,468 --> 01:29:50,034
but Fletcher's been in touch.
He says he's got what we need.

1539
01:29:50,167 --> 01:29:52,633
Careful, boss. Fletcher's ass
belongs to the highest bidder.

1540
01:29:52,767 --> 01:29:54,633
Yeah.
He says he wants 150 grand.

1541
01:29:54,767 --> 01:29:57,134
But if it's proper, it's worth
a whole week's exclusive.

1542
01:29:57,267 --> 01:29:58,533
Well, what does he
have exactly?

1543
01:29:58,667 --> 01:30:00,101
He was just
tickling me nuts,

1544
01:30:00,234 --> 01:30:01,533
but he says
he wants to meet Saturday.

1545
01:30:01,667 --> 01:30:02,767
So keep it free.

1546
01:30:05,167 --> 01:30:06,533
Yeah, pronto.

1547
01:30:13,567 --> 01:30:16,201
Oi, you can't park there,
mate. Move the van.

1548
01:30:16,334 --> 01:30:18,468
Don't worry, friend.
We'll be gone in a minute.

1549
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:20,800
We're not a newspaper.
We're a blood sport.

1550
01:30:20,934 --> 01:30:22,567
Oi, Russ. Move the van.

1551
01:30:22,700 --> 01:30:24,234
I'm on it, boss.

1552
01:30:25,034 --> 01:30:26,667
Move it. Now.

1553
01:30:27,468 --> 01:30:30,567
- I said in a minute.
- Oi, spunk bubble.

1554
01:30:30,700 --> 01:30:32,633
Get rid of
the fucking van.

1555
01:30:37,867 --> 01:30:41,201
I'm warning you,
Russ does karate.

1556
01:30:45,800 --> 01:30:49,067
Careful, boys.
Russ does karate.

1557
01:30:50,500 --> 01:30:52,900
Russ, if you know
what's good for you,

1558
01:30:53,034 --> 01:30:55,001
get in the car now.

1559
01:30:58,468 --> 01:31:01,533
Sorry, boss.
I'm only a blue belt.

1560
01:31:03,034 --> 01:31:04,468
You melt.

1561
01:31:06,001 --> 01:31:09,334
Now what? We're making
a YouTube movie? Eh?

1562
01:31:10,034 --> 01:31:11,301
Break dancing?

1563
01:31:12,134 --> 01:31:15,368
I'm warning you.
I'm fucking powerful.

1564
01:31:15,500 --> 01:31:18,633
We know all that. Why don't you tell
us all about it in the back of the van?

1565
01:31:18,767 --> 01:31:21,800
I'm not going.
I'm not fucking... No!

1566
01:31:21,934 --> 01:31:23,800
No.

1567
01:31:23,934 --> 01:31:25,600
Get him in there.

1568
01:31:28,401 --> 01:31:29,667
Unbelievable.

1569
01:31:34,600 --> 01:31:36,034
Well, well, well.

1570
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:41,667
You're all right, Big Dave.
You're in safe hands now.

1571
01:31:41,800 --> 01:31:44,533
- No need to panic, okay?
- Who are you?

1572
01:31:44,667 --> 01:31:46,500
Don't worry about that
right now.

1573
01:31:47,667 --> 01:31:49,167
Look...

1574
01:31:49,301 --> 01:31:50,934
Look, whatever's
gone on here,

1575
01:31:51,067 --> 01:31:52,633
I just need
to get back to work.

1576
01:31:52,767 --> 01:31:54,667
If you let me go,
I'll just forget all about it.

1577
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:57,767
I'll have you back to work
in short order, my friend.

1578
01:31:57,900 --> 01:31:59,201
Now, I believe
you're a reporter.

1579
01:32:00,633 --> 01:32:02,500
And there's something
I wanna report to you.

1580
01:32:02,633 --> 01:32:04,667
Now, it seems for
this brief moment in time

1581
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:07,001
I've found my way
into the film business,

1582
01:32:07,134 --> 01:32:11,834
and last night I made a film with
an impressively sized farmyard pig.

1583
01:32:15,834 --> 01:32:18,301
Morning, sir.
Two cups of tea.

1584
01:32:18,434 --> 01:32:20,967
One with sugar, one without.

1585
01:32:21,101 --> 01:32:23,067
All right, lads,
go on, give us a minute.

1586
01:32:25,934 --> 01:32:27,867
There are some wet
wipes there over your shoulder.

1587
01:32:28,001 --> 01:32:30,401
Your clothes are neatly folded
there on the bench.

1588
01:32:30,533 --> 01:32:34,167
Now, in due course, you're gonna
press the space bar on this computer

1589
01:32:34,301 --> 01:32:37,800
and you're gonna witness your
participation in said film.

1590
01:32:37,934 --> 01:32:41,334
Now, that little drug we
gave you last night really...

1591
01:32:43,001 --> 01:32:44,734
loosened up
your inhibitions, man.

1592
01:32:45,468 --> 01:32:48,967
The only thing you'll need to do to
stop this little creative expression

1593
01:32:49,101 --> 01:32:51,567
from becoming
a social media sensation

1594
01:32:51,700 --> 01:32:54,533
is lose any interest you have
in the future of Mickey Pearson.

1595
01:32:55,934 --> 01:32:57,834
I'm gonna leave you now
to clean yourself up.

1596
01:32:59,767 --> 01:33:01,368
Space bar, yeah?
Have a hot drink as well.

1597
01:33:01,500 --> 01:33:03,533
It might make you feel
a little bit better.

1598
01:33:03,667 --> 01:33:05,401
It was a fucking rough night
for you.

1599
01:33:07,201 --> 01:33:08,800
Enjoy the show.

1600
01:33:15,267 --> 01:33:19,401
<i>♪ Old
MacDonald Had a farm, e-i-e-i-o ♪</i>

1601
01:33:19,533 --> 01:33:22,201
<i>♪ And on that farm He had a pig... ♪</i>

1602
01:33:22,334 --> 01:33:24,567
- How's your man, then, Coach?
- Ah, he'll survive.

1603
01:33:24,700 --> 01:33:26,700
Wouldn't have been the pig I would have chosen, though.

1604
01:33:31,267 --> 01:33:32,767
We know what bit that is.

1605
01:33:34,500 --> 01:33:36,533
<i>Let me tickle that belly.</i>

1606
01:33:36,667 --> 01:33:39,434
<i>You are so naughty.</i>

1607
01:33:39,567 --> 01:33:41,934
- Good Lord.
- I was there and I'm still shocked.

1608
01:33:42,500 --> 01:33:44,201
<i>Squeal for me, piggy.</i>

1609
01:33:44,334 --> 01:33:47,001
- Is that who I think it is?
- Yeah, it certainly is.

1610
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:50,867
And that's your doing?

1611
01:33:51,001 --> 01:33:52,800
<i>Where is that applesauce?</i>

1612
01:33:53,401 --> 01:33:55,267
You can't unsee it
once you've seen it, can you?

1613
01:33:55,401 --> 01:33:57,368
No, you can't unsee it.
It's nightmare fuel.

1614
01:33:57,500 --> 01:33:58,667
That will be with me forever.

1615
01:34:00,067 --> 01:34:01,500
That story
won't be running.

1616
01:34:03,934 --> 01:34:06,700
Right. I've got one more
thing I need you to do.

1617
01:34:06,834 --> 01:34:09,533
Ah, look,
before you continue, Ray,

1618
01:34:09,667 --> 01:34:13,767
I train lads to be good lads.
I'm not a fucking gangster.

1619
01:34:13,900 --> 01:34:17,267
Now, I've been forced to do some
gangster things, that's okay.

1620
01:34:17,401 --> 01:34:19,434
But I'm not the gift
that keeps on giving.

1621
01:34:19,567 --> 01:34:22,167
So with the greatest respect,
I'll do this one last thing for you

1622
01:34:22,301 --> 01:34:23,767
and then that's it.

1623
01:34:23,900 --> 01:34:27,301
<i>No más.</i>
Three strikes and I'm out.

1624
01:34:34,101 --> 01:34:36,167
- Everything all right, Coach?
- No, Ernie, it isn't.

1625
01:34:36,301 --> 01:34:38,867
You need to understand the
severity of your actions.

1626
01:34:45,967 --> 01:34:47,567
Dave, an hour.

1627
01:34:47,700 --> 01:34:48,734
Okay, boss.

1628
01:34:53,767 --> 01:34:55,867
Thank you
for the grand tour.

1629
01:34:56,001 --> 01:34:57,533
I'm a believer.

1630
01:34:57,667 --> 01:34:59,001
Thank you, chaps.

1631
01:35:01,334 --> 01:35:03,734
Now, are we ready
to finalize the numbers?

1632
01:35:04,533 --> 01:35:05,633
We already have.

1633
01:35:05,767 --> 01:35:07,201
Mm...

1634
01:35:07,334 --> 01:35:09,468
The situation's changed,
Michael.

1635
01:35:09,600 --> 01:35:12,167
- The market's changed.
- How so?

1636
01:35:12,700 --> 01:35:16,301
The exit value of your business
needs to be recalculated.

1637
01:35:17,034 --> 01:35:18,967
Please, be specific.

1638
01:35:19,101 --> 01:35:21,001
Oh, I will be.

1639
01:35:21,134 --> 01:35:24,468
You're asking 400 for 12 locations
and a distribution network,

1640
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:27,067
which was a fair valuation
at the time.

1641
01:35:27,201 --> 01:35:30,001
But when one of those
locations was compromised,

1642
01:35:30,134 --> 01:35:32,468
the value of all those
locations were compromised

1643
01:35:32,600 --> 01:35:34,301
and this obviously
affects the price.

1644
01:35:35,134 --> 01:35:38,767
Your skunk farm was a fucking viral
sensation on YouTube, Michael.

1645
01:35:38,900 --> 01:35:41,368
And when Johnny Law starts
sniffing, which he will,

1646
01:35:41,500 --> 01:35:43,600
all of those locations
will have to cease production

1647
01:35:43,734 --> 01:35:47,500
for, I'd say, at least 12 months
at a cost of 100 million net p.a.,

1648
01:35:47,633 --> 01:35:50,334
before marking down the loss of
staff, relocation and site rentals.

1649
01:35:50,468 --> 01:35:52,267
- You still with me?
- Yes, I'm following.

1650
01:35:52,401 --> 01:35:54,533
It will take
at least three years

1651
01:35:54,667 --> 01:35:58,134
to get your supply, distribution
and demand back to full capacity.

1652
01:35:58,267 --> 01:36:02,001
Your staffing costs are 25% of
your 100 million operational cost,

1653
01:36:02,134 --> 01:36:05,700
so that's 25 million per annum
for three annums.

1654
01:36:05,834 --> 01:36:08,167
And location rental
at 15 million a year,

1655
01:36:08,301 --> 01:36:12,334
that's a 120 GBP bite
right there.

1656
01:36:12,468 --> 01:36:15,034
Your unit economics
have taken a hit,

1657
01:36:15,167 --> 01:36:19,700
and forecasting out your top-line growth
margin in the current inimical climate,

1658
01:36:19,834 --> 01:36:23,101
I calculate what was worth
400 million a month ago

1659
01:36:23,234 --> 01:36:27,700
must now be valued
at an anemic, mm... 130.

1660
01:36:28,934 --> 01:36:32,667
You see, it's not about the
first domino that fell, Michael.

1661
01:36:33,500 --> 01:36:34,667
It's about the last.

1662
01:36:37,001 --> 01:36:38,067
Please.

1663
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:44,334
I like you, Michael.
You're a good chap.

1664
01:36:45,134 --> 01:36:48,834
And if you want me to help you out of
this hole you've found yourself in,

1665
01:36:49,468 --> 01:36:52,500
I can pay you
100 million dollars today.

1666
01:36:53,500 --> 01:36:55,967
It's a good offer
and it's real,

1667
01:36:56,101 --> 01:36:58,234
and I'll do this
because I'm your friend.

1668
01:36:58,368 --> 01:37:01,468
My accountant can transfer
the fee within the hour.

1669
01:37:02,368 --> 01:37:04,401
I like your domino analogy.

1670
01:37:06,134 --> 01:37:10,167
The question I ask is,
who tumbled the first domino?

1671
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:13,900
I'm afraid that's not my
concern or my business, Michael.

1672
01:37:14,034 --> 01:37:15,867
At the risk
of contradicting you,

1673
01:37:16,001 --> 01:37:19,967
it is very much your business,
and certainly your concern.

1674
01:37:21,434 --> 01:37:22,900
Only you made one mistake.

1675
01:37:24,267 --> 01:37:25,401
That being?

1676
01:37:26,001 --> 01:37:28,967
You seem to have mistaken me
for some kind of a cunt.

1677
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:33,201
Let me introduce you
to the first domino.

1678
01:37:37,267 --> 01:37:41,934
It's a tad dramatic, isn't it,
corpses in freezers? Who is this man?

1679
01:37:42,067 --> 01:37:44,101
What's he got to do with
anything that I'm talking about?

1680
01:37:44,234 --> 01:37:46,834
I take it with that statement
you are in denial

1681
01:37:46,967 --> 01:37:49,533
of so-said relationship
with this frozen Chinaman?

1682
01:37:49,667 --> 01:37:51,834
Well, of course
I'm in denial of it.

1683
01:37:51,967 --> 01:37:55,633
I don't have relationships
with dead, frozen Chinamen.

1684
01:37:55,767 --> 01:37:59,334
Best not to be glib at this time
in the proceedings, Matthew.

1685
01:38:03,067 --> 01:38:05,301
Don't bother looking
for your Mossad crabs.

1686
01:38:05,434 --> 01:38:07,867
This is a fish market.
They have found a home.

1687
01:38:08,401 --> 01:38:10,934
To be clear,
I do not know that man.

1688
01:38:13,234 --> 01:38:15,034
<i>I'll tell you
how this plays out.</i>

1689
01:38:15,633 --> 01:38:20,201
<i>You will drown and then
my Mossad crabs will eat you.</i>

1690
01:38:20,334 --> 01:38:23,633
So while you were discussing
who would take over my business

1691
01:38:23,767 --> 01:38:25,267
after you fucked it,

1692
01:38:26,234 --> 01:38:29,301
you somehow mistook so-said
Chinaman for someone else?

1693
01:38:30,967 --> 01:38:35,001
Business is business, Michael.
It's nothing personal.

1694
01:38:35,134 --> 01:38:37,468
While I am not emotional
about the money,

1695
01:38:37,600 --> 01:38:41,368
there is a price indebted to me for
the blood I've gotten on my hands

1696
01:38:41,500 --> 01:38:44,900
restoring order to the
untidiness that you created,

1697
01:38:45,034 --> 01:38:46,667
and that price,
according to you...

1698
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:50,834
400 minus 130...
is 270 million dollars.

1699
01:38:50,967 --> 01:38:54,034
And I'm keeping
the business,

1700
01:38:55,334 --> 01:38:58,468
while you are
getting in the freezer.

1701
01:38:59,134 --> 01:39:02,234
And you will make that transaction if
you want to get out of the freezer.

1702
01:39:02,368 --> 01:39:06,834
It is 25 below zero in there,
so I assume you'll last about an hour.

1703
01:39:06,967 --> 01:39:08,734
That said,
I wouldn't fuck about,

1704
01:39:08,867 --> 01:39:11,034
because frostbite is very
expensive on the fingers and toes,

1705
01:39:11,167 --> 01:39:13,310
so I would type as quickly as possible
while you have the use of them.

1706
01:39:13,325 --> 01:39:15,425
- Uh...
- After you've attended to that indiscretion,

1707
01:39:15,559 --> 01:39:19,425
you can then deal with the next
consequence of your shortsightedness.

1708
01:39:19,993 --> 01:39:23,959
As stated,
I am not emotional about the money.

1709
01:39:26,659 --> 01:39:30,325
But I am emotional about the fact that
someone laid their hands on my wife.

1710
01:39:33,659 --> 01:39:34,926
My wife!

1711
01:39:37,525 --> 01:39:40,959
No amount of money on God's green earth
can pay for that transgression, Matthew.

1712
01:39:41,093 --> 01:39:42,659
No, for that...

1713
01:39:46,525 --> 01:39:47,759
I want a pound of flesh.

1714
01:39:48,926 --> 01:39:49,993
A pound of flesh?

1715
01:39:50,125 --> 01:39:51,659
It matters not to me

1716
01:39:51,792 --> 01:39:53,792
where on your anatomy
it is withdrawn from.

1717
01:39:54,726 --> 01:39:57,926
If you don't have the stomach
to take it for yourself,

1718
01:39:58,059 --> 01:40:00,158
big Bunny here
is very adept with a knife,

1719
01:40:00,292 --> 01:40:02,125
and, as you can see,
he's dressed for the weather.

1720
01:40:02,258 --> 01:40:06,559
But a penny short
or a gram shy...

1721
01:40:07,959 --> 01:40:10,392
and that freezer door
does not open.

1722
01:40:10,525 --> 01:40:11,559
Am I clear?

1723
01:40:12,692 --> 01:40:13,726
Good.

1724
01:40:14,792 --> 01:40:16,459
- Bunny.
- Incoming.

1725
01:40:29,225 --> 01:40:31,626
What, is it Wagyu again
for breakfast, Raymond?

1726
01:40:33,959 --> 01:40:37,626
Aren't you gonna introduce me to your
mysterious and slightly menacing friend?

1727
01:40:42,993 --> 01:40:45,093
What's that for?
Is that for my money?

1728
01:40:47,559 --> 01:40:48,692
Where's my money, Raymond?

1729
01:40:48,826 --> 01:40:50,292
There's your payment.

1730
01:40:54,093 --> 01:40:55,592
Go on, take a look.

1731
01:40:55,726 --> 01:40:57,592
Thank you,
mysterious stranger.

1732
01:41:07,726 --> 01:41:10,258
Well, that's disappointing, 'cause that
doesn't look like 20 million pounds.

1733
01:41:10,392 --> 01:41:13,425
It's more interesting than that,
your insurance policy,

1734
01:41:13,559 --> 01:41:16,959
all the photos, all the bodies,
all the skeletons, all the filth.

1735
01:41:17,093 --> 01:41:21,325
It's not the only one,
darling. I'm not a mong.

1736
01:41:21,459 --> 01:41:23,759
What do you think's in that,
you fucking eejit?

1737
01:41:24,626 --> 01:41:26,759
Of course we were
aware of what Matthew was up to.

1738
01:41:26,892 --> 01:41:28,626
We're not complete
fucking idiots.

1739
01:41:30,826 --> 01:41:33,592
I've been onto you
for a long time, Fletcher.

1740
01:41:34,559 --> 01:41:36,626
I knew you'd been following Michael.

1741
01:41:36,759 --> 01:41:38,392
<i>They're very similar,
our jobs.</i>

1742
01:41:38,959 --> 01:41:41,192
<i>Only I'm better at it
than you are.</i>

1743
01:41:42,892 --> 01:41:46,459
I knew when you came over that night that
you'd only be there for half an hour...

1744
01:41:47,325 --> 01:41:49,258
<i>Buenas tardes, Raymondo.</i>

1745
01:41:49,392 --> 01:41:52,459
...to tell me how clever you
are and try to blackmail us.

1746
01:41:53,192 --> 01:41:55,459
I've got some very important
information to impart to you, Raymond.

1747
01:41:55,592 --> 01:41:59,093
I also knew you couldn't
resist a £1500 single malt,

1748
01:41:59,225 --> 01:42:02,626
an £80 Wagyu steak and a
state-of-the-art smokeless barbie

1749
01:42:03,192 --> 01:42:05,826
- that even keeps your feet warm.
- I love a barbie.

1750
01:42:05,959 --> 01:42:08,826
I promise you, you will regret
this if you don't hear it.

1751
01:42:08,959 --> 01:42:11,592
And when the Scotch
got into your cold veins,

1752
01:42:11,726 --> 01:42:14,425
you lost the benefit
of your sharp instincts.

1753
01:42:14,892 --> 01:42:17,125
Oh, goody. Another bottle.

1754
01:42:17,258 --> 01:42:19,792
Can you tell the mysterious
gentleman to relax?

1755
01:42:19,926 --> 01:42:22,959
Because I promise you, you will regret it
if you don't hear this. Sit down, my love.

1756
01:42:23,093 --> 01:42:26,492
See, I kept you there 'cause I needed
to know about Matthew and Dry Eye.

1757
01:42:27,692 --> 01:42:30,726
<i>Took us a while to find
your insurance policies.</i>

1758
01:42:32,392 --> 01:42:34,425
<i>'Cause you're
a naughty squirrel, Fletcher.</i>

1759
01:42:35,359 --> 01:42:37,492
Fletcher, shoes off inside.

1760
01:42:37,626 --> 01:42:38,926
Yes, Mommy.

1761
01:42:39,959 --> 01:42:43,292
<i>But it was made a lot easier after
I planted a tracker in your shoe.</i>

1762
01:42:47,759 --> 01:42:49,959
<i>You're never gonna be
a predator with us, Fletcher.</i>

1763
01:42:51,826 --> 01:42:53,659
You're always
gonna be prey.

1764
01:42:54,892 --> 01:42:58,258
So that's it. Three strikes.
We're good, right?

1765
01:43:00,959 --> 01:43:04,093
- I'll see you around.
- With the greatest respect, I hope not.

1766
01:43:10,425 --> 01:43:14,826
Now, Fletcher,
what were you saying?

1767
01:43:15,559 --> 01:43:18,125
It wasn't
Lord George that was after Mickey,

1768
01:43:18,258 --> 01:43:20,692
or Dry Eye, or Matthew.

1769
01:43:21,826 --> 01:43:23,158
Do you wanna know who it was?

1770
01:43:27,792 --> 01:43:28,993
I've got photos.

1771
01:43:31,726 --> 01:43:33,592
Right.
You've got 30 seconds.

1772
01:43:33,726 --> 01:43:34,759
Thank you, darling.

1773
01:43:36,792 --> 01:43:38,626
Fuck.

1774
01:43:40,392 --> 01:43:41,826
Primetime,
what is it, son?

1775
01:43:41,959 --> 01:43:44,759
Coach, we're gonna take
care of this for you.

1776
01:43:44,892 --> 01:43:46,258
Ernie's got a plan.

1777
01:43:46,525 --> 01:43:48,225
What the fuck
are you talking about?

1778
01:43:48,359 --> 01:43:51,592
The Michael situation.
We're gonna sort it.

1779
01:43:53,359 --> 01:43:54,959
Primetime, listen... Prime...

1780
01:43:56,425 --> 01:43:57,392
Jesus.

1781
01:44:08,525 --> 01:44:10,292
<i>Now, you
remember Aslan, don't you?</i>

1782
01:44:10,926 --> 01:44:13,425
The young gentleman
you kept in the freezer?

1783
01:44:15,892 --> 01:44:20,425
Well, this is Aslan Senior,
Russian oligarch.

1784
01:44:21,926 --> 01:44:24,125
<i>Ex-KGB. Made all
his money in gas pipes.</i>

1785
01:44:24,258 --> 01:44:27,459
And he's extremely sad that his
one-and-only son fell out of a window.

1786
01:44:27,926 --> 01:44:29,425
Oh, shit.

1787
01:44:29,726 --> 01:44:31,626
And I fear that where
they failed before, Raymond,

1788
01:44:31,759 --> 01:44:33,959
they're not gonna fail again.

1789
01:44:34,093 --> 01:44:36,093
And how do you know
all this?

1790
01:44:36,225 --> 01:44:39,425
Because someone told them everything
they want to know about Michael,

1791
01:44:39,559 --> 01:44:42,225
and that someone is me.

1792
01:44:43,425 --> 01:44:44,626
Go on.

1793
01:44:45,592 --> 01:44:48,325
<i>So I said I'd tell them
where Michael was for a price.</i>

1794
01:44:49,225 --> 01:44:53,026
But that money was pending till
after, you know, the deed was done.

1795
01:44:54,993 --> 01:44:56,792
<i>And then when they
messed up the first time,</i>

1796
01:44:56,926 --> 01:45:00,258
I had a little rethink and came
up with my version 2.0 plan,

1797
01:45:00,392 --> 01:45:02,292
which is
when I came to see you.

1798
01:45:02,425 --> 01:45:05,125
You see, get my 20 mils
off Michael first

1799
01:45:05,258 --> 01:45:09,659
and then, after the event,
get paid again, double bubble.

1800
01:45:09,792 --> 01:45:13,192
But you and your mysterious friend
put paid to that, so well done, you.

1801
01:45:13,993 --> 01:45:15,492
Why did you just
look at your watch?

1802
01:45:16,959 --> 01:45:20,492
Well, it's like I say.
The Russians are gonna clean house.

1803
01:45:20,626 --> 01:45:23,692
And you are part of
that house, Raymond.

1804
01:45:23,826 --> 01:45:26,792
They're gonna get Michael when he comes
out of his meeting at the fish market.

1805
01:45:27,826 --> 01:45:30,425
And they are coming here.
So you see what I've done there?

1806
01:45:30,926 --> 01:45:32,759
By telling you,
I've saved your lives.

1807
01:45:32,892 --> 01:45:34,859
Which I think in turn
saves mine, doesn't it?

1808
01:45:34,993 --> 01:45:36,759
Don't fucking move.

1809
01:45:44,726 --> 01:45:45,826
Dave.

1810
01:45:46,592 --> 01:45:47,692
Dave?

1811
01:45:56,726 --> 01:45:57,959
No Dave.

1812
01:46:03,059 --> 01:46:04,093
Fuck.

1813
01:46:09,559 --> 01:46:11,258
Fuck!

1814
01:46:51,726 --> 01:46:52,692
Fuck.

1815
01:47:09,392 --> 01:47:11,859
<i>So the Toddlers
spray the car with bullets,</i>

1816
01:47:11,993 --> 01:47:13,759
killing the Russians.

1817
01:47:14,792 --> 01:47:16,759
<i>The car rolls to a stop.</i>

1818
01:47:18,059 --> 01:47:20,492
Smash cut to black. Titles.

1819
01:47:21,993 --> 01:47:24,659
So, what happened
to Michael?

1820
01:47:25,792 --> 01:47:27,125
<i>I need an ending.</i>

1821
01:47:27,258 --> 01:47:28,859
<i>No, no, no, my darling.</i>

1822
01:47:30,158 --> 01:47:31,626
<i>What you need...</i>

1823
01:47:32,425 --> 01:47:33,826
is a sequel.

1824
01:47:34,125 --> 01:47:36,959
Think it over. Have a read.
You know my fee.

1825
01:47:37,093 --> 01:47:39,525
I'm off to La La
to talk to the competition.

1826
01:47:40,125 --> 01:47:43,592
Think about that.
Got a plane to catch. And I'm gone.

1827
01:47:48,659 --> 01:47:50,026
Good afternoon.

1828
01:47:50,926 --> 01:47:54,258
So, it's Heathrow
Airport, please, Terminal 3,

1829
01:47:54,392 --> 01:47:56,659
and thence
to sunny California.

1830
01:47:58,859 --> 01:48:02,459
<i>Buenas tardes,
Fletcher-mondo.</i>

1831
01:48:03,026 --> 01:48:06,093
Raymond. Well, well, well.

1832
01:48:06,225 --> 01:48:08,093
A man of many vocations,
aren't you?

1833
01:48:17,592 --> 01:48:20,059
Now, I want you to play
a game with me, Fletcher.

1834
01:48:25,692 --> 01:48:26,926
He's got Fletcher.

1835
01:48:28,726 --> 01:48:30,492
<i>If you wish to be
the king of the jungle,</i>

1836
01:48:30,626 --> 01:48:32,993
<i>it's not enough
to act like a king.</i>

1837
01:48:33,826 --> 01:48:35,492
<i>You must be the king.</i>

1838
01:48:36,892 --> 01:48:38,826
<i>And there can be no doubt.</i>

1839
01:48:38,959 --> 01:48:42,559
<i>Because doubt causes chaos
and one's own demise.</i>

1840
01:48:44,359 --> 01:48:45,892
<i>My queen told me that.</i>

1841
01:48:47,125 --> 01:48:48,425
Any chance?

1842
01:48:48,428 --> 01:48:49,189
