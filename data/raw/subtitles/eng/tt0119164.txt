4
00:00:48,892 --> 00:00:50,883
Welcome to Sheffield!

5
00:00:50,972 --> 00:00:53,964
The beating heart
of Britain's industriaINorth!

6
00:00:54,052 --> 00:00:58,250
The jewel in Yorkshire's crown
is home to over halfa million people,...

7
00:00:58,332 --> 00:01:02,325
..and thousands more
flock here daily to shop and to work.

8
00:01:02,412 --> 00:01:05,370
All this is built on
Sheffield's primary industry,...

9
00:01:05,452 --> 00:01:07,124
..steel.

10
00:01:07,212 --> 00:01:10,329
The city's rolling mills, forges,...

11
00:01:10,412 --> 00:01:12,846
..and workshops employ some 90,000 men...

12
00:01:12,932 --> 00:01:16,720
..and state-of-the-art machinery
to make the world's finest steel.

13
00:01:16,812 --> 00:01:19,531
From high-tensile girders...

14
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:22,684
..to the stainless cutlery
for your dining table.

15
00:01:22,772 --> 00:01:25,764
But it's not all hard work
for the people of Steel City.

16
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:29,208
They can spend the day
lounging by the pool,...

17
00:01:29,292 --> 00:01:31,886
..watching one of our top soccer teams,...

18
00:01:31,972 --> 00:01:34,850
..or browsing in the shops.

19
00:01:37,332 --> 00:01:41,371
But when the sun goes down,
the fun really starts...

20
00:01:41,452 --> 00:01:44,762
..in the city's numerous
night clubs and discotheques.

21
00:01:44,852 --> 00:01:47,650
Yes, Yorkshire folk know
how to have a good time!

22
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:50,769
And it's good times
for the city's housing, too!

23
00:01:50,852 --> 00:01:53,320
Sheffield leads the way in town planning.

24
00:01:53,412 --> 00:01:57,724
Victorian slums have been cleared
to make way for the homes of the future.

25
00:01:59,892 --> 00:02:02,008
Thanks to steel,...

26
00:02:02,092 --> 00:02:03,844
..Sheffield really is...

27
00:02:03,932 --> 00:02:06,366
..a city on the move!

28
00:02:25,412 --> 00:02:28,563
Gaz, who's gonna buy a rusty girder?

29
00:02:28,652 --> 00:02:30,847
- Come on.
- Dad, it's stealing!

30
00:02:30,932 --> 00:02:33,446
No, it's liberating, love. Liberating.

31
00:02:33,532 --> 00:02:35,568
Gaz, hang on.

32
00:02:37,052 --> 00:02:39,612
Ten years we worked in "ere. Now look.

33
00:02:39,692 --> 00:02:43,731
- What if we get caught?
- You don't get a criminal record till you're 16.

34
00:02:43,812 --> 00:02:45,928
- Just don't tell your mum.
- 'ey, listen.

35
00:02:46,012 --> 00:02:48,606
- (brass band plays)
- Music.

36
00:02:53,332 --> 00:02:55,527
Bloody hell!

37
00:03:01,052 --> 00:03:04,761
- What are they doing?
- It's the works band. It's still going.

38
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:07,730
About only thing round "ere that is.

39
00:03:09,492 --> 00:03:11,483

41
00:03:20,172 --> 00:03:22,208
"Won't take a minute", he says.

42
00:03:22,292 --> 00:03:24,283
"Won't take a minute." Now what?

43
00:03:24,372 --> 00:03:26,363
Shut up. I'm thinking.

44
00:03:27,212 --> 00:03:29,806
Can't we do normal things sometimes?

45
00:03:29,892 --> 00:03:32,122
This is normal! Int' it, Dave?

46
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,168
Oh, aye. Everyday stuff, this.

47
00:03:34,252 --> 00:03:36,208
I think this bugger's sinking.

48
00:03:37,892 --> 00:03:40,770
Pick it up,
and try and slide it across other side.

49
00:03:40,852 --> 00:03:42,251
That's it.

50
00:03:42,852 --> 00:03:45,207
Oh, fucking hell, Nathe!

51
00:03:45,292 --> 00:03:49,843
They're 20 quid each, them!
That were your bloody maintenance!

52
00:03:49,932 --> 00:03:52,492
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, nice one.

53
00:03:52,572 --> 00:03:54,290

54

- Come "ere, come "ere!

56
00:03:59,052 --> 00:04:01,043

57
00:04:01,132 --> 00:04:03,123
Stay still, stay still.

58
00:04:03,852 --> 00:04:05,843
All right.

59
00:04:06,452 --> 00:04:10,445
What's your initiative got to say
about this, then, bog eyes?

60
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:14,286
'ey up, there's someone coming.

61
00:04:15,532 --> 00:04:18,490
- All right?!
- Aye, not so bad.

62
00:04:19,532 --> 00:04:21,329
'tot so bad"?

63
00:04:21,412 --> 00:04:24,449
"not so bad"?
That's not much of a chuffing SOS!

64
00:04:24,532 --> 00:04:26,523
All right, don't get a benny on.

65
00:04:29,052 --> 00:04:31,043
Shit!

66
00:04:37,172 --> 00:04:39,163
Me jeans are bloody soaking!

67
00:04:39,252 --> 00:04:41,322
You should have taken your kit off.

68
00:04:41,412 --> 00:04:44,210
- What's up? Are you shy?
- Don't! Shut it, all right?

69
00:04:45,372 --> 00:04:47,010
'ey up, Dave.

70
00:04:47,092 --> 00:04:49,083

- Dad!

71

Eight? Maybe even a nine.

72

- You can never tell till you see their tits.
- Dad!

73
00:04:56,092 --> 00:04:58,845
- What's all this?
- It's them Chippendale efforts.

74
00:04:58,932 --> 00:05:02,447
- You what?
- Them dancers. Mum were going on about it.

75
00:05:02,532 --> 00:05:05,410
Oh, you're joking!
She must be getting desperate.

76
00:05:05,492 --> 00:05:09,087
- You all waiting for me, then?
- Yeah! To go home.

77
00:05:09,172 --> 00:05:11,891
You know where to find me
when you tire of them poofs.

78
00:05:11,972 --> 00:05:14,440
- Dad!
- Come on, Gaz, I'm freezing.

79

80
00:05:17,212 --> 00:05:20,010

81
00:05:20,092 --> 00:05:22,367
I mean, look at the state of that!

82
00:05:22,452 --> 00:05:24,170

83

84

Not in a gym'll help you there, mate!

85
00:05:28,492 --> 00:05:30,960
No decent woman would
be seen dead in there.

86
00:05:31,052 --> 00:05:33,008
Jean would.

87

tackle at your missis?! Where's your pride?!

She's already got you hoovering! I saw it
and I let it go! But this? No, no, no.

91
00:05:48,332 --> 00:05:50,846
- Get her out of here.
- It's women only.

92
00:05:53,252 --> 00:05:55,846
Hurry up, will you? Me feet have gone numb.

into Alley of Death for you, you fat git.

Right, then. I'll wait "ere and keep guard.

96

Uncle Dave wants a word outside.

It's what they do with 'em.

and I don't fancy Frank, right? So give over!

Do you think he might, though?

115
00:07:13,732 --> 00:07:15,962
No. Couldn't do that to Dave.

Aye, and it says job club up there.
When did you last see one of them walk in?

173
00:10:33,572 --> 00:10:34,800
(laughter)

174
00:10:34,892 --> 00:10:37,531
You forget, Gerald,
you're not our foreman now.

175
00:10:37,612 --> 00:10:39,921
You're just like the rest of us.

176
00:10:40,012 --> 00:10:43,049
- Scrap.
- Shut it, right?

177
00:10:45,212 --> 00:10:49,967
Hang on, though. Why were all them women
Int' working-men's club int' first place?

178
00:10:50,052 --> 00:10:52,486
Now then! Cos of us. Men.

179
00:10:52,572 --> 00:10:54,563
You call them Chippendales men?

180
00:10:54,652 --> 00:10:56,643
Degrading, that's what it were.

181
00:10:56,732 --> 00:10:58,643
How many lassies were there, though?

182
00:10:58,732 --> 00:11:01,371
Thousands. Baying for blood.

183
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:04,808
Ten quid to watch some fucking poof
get his kit off! Ten quid!

184
00:11:04,892 --> 00:11:08,965
Times ten quid by a thousand, right?
And you've got...

185
00:11:10,652 --> 00:11:12,643
Yeah, well, a lot. A very lot.

186
00:11:12,732 --> 00:11:14,051
Nah.

187
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:16,202
10,000 quid.

188
00:11:17,772 --> 00:11:21,162
- How much?
- 10,000 quid.

189
00:11:23,772 --> 00:11:27,845
'ey, now, Dave, I mean...
It's worth a thought, though, innit?

190
00:11:29,492 --> 00:11:33,201
Little And Large prancing round Sheffield
with their widgers out!

191
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:35,283
That would be worth ten quid!

192
00:11:35,372 --> 00:11:38,489
Don't be so bloody daft.
We were just saying...

193
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:42,645
- Widgers on parade! Bring a microscope!
- I don't see why the chuff not!

194
00:11:42,732 --> 00:11:46,327
Because you're fat and he's thin,
and you're both fucking ugly.

195
00:11:46,412 --> 00:11:48,528
Bastard!

196
00:11:51,132 --> 00:11:53,123
(shouting)

197
00:12:01,612 --> 00:12:03,603
What's all this about sole custody?

198
00:12:03,692 --> 00:12:07,048
You know what. If you want
joint custody, you pay your share.

199
00:12:07,132 --> 00:12:10,283
- 700 quid.
- I'm ont" dole, in case you hadn't noticed!

200
00:12:10,372 --> 00:12:14,684
- Get a job! I'll gi' you a job!
- £2.50 an hour in Black Hole of Calcutta!

201
00:12:14,772 --> 00:12:16,410
No, thank you.

202
00:12:16,492 --> 00:12:20,849
If you want to play your games, do that,
but Nathan's gonna have two parents now.

203
00:12:20,932 --> 00:12:23,127
And your live-in lover's gonna do that?

204
00:12:23,212 --> 00:12:25,772
Abracadabra, here he is! Evening, Barry.

205
00:12:25,852 --> 00:12:28,320
That'll be for t" court to decide.

206
00:12:28,412 --> 00:12:32,325
No, it won't. Nathan's yours and mine.
He's fuck-all to do with him!

207
00:12:32,412 --> 00:12:36,928
- As if you've ever given a toss.
- Face it. He don't like staying at yours.

208
00:12:37,492 --> 00:12:39,881
Course he bloody does! Ask him!

209
00:12:39,972 --> 00:12:41,963
Ask him!

210
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:44,441
Oi, Nathe! We have a laugh, don't we?

211
00:12:44,532 --> 00:12:46,682
- Gary! Don't!
- Is he in?

212
00:12:46,772 --> 00:12:48,524
Is he in?!

213
00:12:48,612 --> 00:12:50,682
Nathe!

214
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:55,128
He can't hear you through your...
triple bloody glazing.

215
00:12:55,212 --> 00:12:57,043
He can hear all right.

216
00:12:57,132 --> 00:13:03,048
This... This is all wrong, this is.
It's all to fucking cock. I'm his dad, and you...

217
00:13:03,132 --> 00:13:05,123
You're nobody.

218
00:13:05,212 --> 00:13:07,203
Good night, Gary.

219
00:13:19,172 --> 00:13:21,163
Night, Nathe!

220
00:13:22,132 --> 00:13:24,123
See you, kid!

221
00:13:32,412 --> 00:13:33,811
No. Not doing it.

222
00:13:33,892 --> 00:13:36,645
- I'm not stripping.
- They're taking him away.

223
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:39,292
All I need is 700 quid
and they've got not on me.

224
00:13:39,372 --> 00:13:41,932
- Gaz, no.
- Dave, he's me kid!

225
00:13:42,012 --> 00:13:44,446
I suppose there's nicking cars.

226
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,841
- No!
- Well, then?

227
00:13:46,932 --> 00:13:50,129
Look, I'll help, all right? I'm running, aren't l?

228
00:13:50,212 --> 00:13:52,203
But I'm taking not off. Final.

229
00:13:52,292 --> 00:13:54,283
Come on, Dave. Don't stop now.

230
00:13:54,372 --> 00:13:57,569
- Keep up, you fat bastard!
- Gazza, you tosser!

231
00:14:05,972 --> 00:14:07,963
(Dave) Do you need a hand?

232
00:14:15,452 --> 00:14:18,091
Yeah, it's your HT leads, I reckon.

233
00:14:19,652 --> 00:14:21,643
Give it a go at that.

234
00:14:21,732 --> 00:14:23,723
(engine starts)

235
00:14:29,332 --> 00:14:31,971
Didn't you work at Harrisons
afore it shut down?

236
00:14:32,052 --> 00:14:34,043
Ah! I thought I clocked you!

237
00:14:34,132 --> 00:14:37,807
I were ont" floor with Gaz. Him up the road.

238
00:14:37,892 --> 00:14:40,531
How's it going, then?

239
00:14:40,612 --> 00:14:42,682
You got any work?

240
00:14:44,772 --> 00:14:46,842
No, there's not a lot about, is there?

241
00:14:46,932 --> 00:14:49,969
Well, like I say,
get some new ones when you can.

242
00:14:50,052 --> 00:14:53,249
No, no, my chuffing pleasure(!)

243
00:15:03,892 --> 00:15:05,883
Dave?

244
00:15:11,052 --> 00:15:12,644
(coughing)

245
00:15:15,772 --> 00:15:18,764
- Are you all right, kid?
- You bastard!

246
00:15:23,372 --> 00:15:25,761
'ey! 'ey!

247
00:15:38,172 --> 00:15:40,163
You could shoot yoursen.

248
00:15:40,252 --> 00:15:43,130
(Gaz) Where's he gonna find
a gun from round "ere?

249
00:15:44,132 --> 00:15:47,124
You wanna find yourself
a big bridge, you do.

250
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:51,842
Yeah. Like one of them bungee jumps,
only without the bungee bit.

251
00:15:51,932 --> 00:15:54,400
I can't stand heights, me.

252
00:16:01,892 --> 00:16:04,087
Drowning. Now there's a way to go.

253
00:16:06,652 --> 00:16:08,643
I can't swim.

254
00:16:08,732 --> 00:16:12,247
You don't have to fucking swim, you divvy.
That's the point.

255
00:16:12,332 --> 00:16:14,323
You're not very keen, are you?

256
00:16:14,412 --> 00:16:16,403
Sorry.

257
00:16:17,172 --> 00:16:19,163
I know.

258
00:16:19,252 --> 00:16:24,167
Stand in the middle oft" road and get
a mate to drive smack into you right fast.

259
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,882
Haven't got any mates.

260
00:16:28,972 --> 00:16:32,760
We just saved your fucking life,
so don't tell us we're not your mates!

261
00:16:34,532 --> 00:16:37,365
- Yeah?
- (Dave) Yeah, me an" all.

262
00:16:37,452 --> 00:16:39,920
I'd run you down soon as look at you.

263
00:16:40,012 --> 00:16:41,331
Oh, cheers.

264
00:16:41,412 --> 00:16:42,606
Ta.

265
00:16:46,252 --> 00:16:48,402
Thanks a lot.

266
00:16:56,652 --> 00:16:58,643
(front door)

267
00:16:59,452 --> 00:17:01,443
(panting)

268
00:17:04,012 --> 00:17:06,731
- What are you doing, Mum?
- Where have you been?

269
00:17:06,812 --> 00:17:08,803
Driving.

270
00:17:09,972 --> 00:17:12,440
- Driving where?
- Just driving.

271
00:17:13,852 --> 00:17:15,922
(Mum) I thought you'd gone.

272
00:17:16,732 --> 00:17:20,042
Security guard in 'ere?
No wonder he wants to kill himself.

273
00:17:20,132 --> 00:17:23,920
Well, at least one bloke got a job
out of this place being shut down.

274
00:17:24,852 --> 00:17:28,049
What did you tell him for, any road?
The kid's a nutter.

275
00:17:28,132 --> 00:17:30,123
He's a bugle player.

276
00:17:30,212 --> 00:17:33,761
Could come in right handy.
Might need a bit of music.

277
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:36,844
He's got a car. Somewhere to practise.

278
00:17:37,852 --> 00:17:41,447
Besides, it's good whatsitsname
for the lad... Therapy.

279
00:17:41,532 --> 00:17:44,524
Oh, aye! Jiggling about in the buff. Therapy!

280
00:17:44,612 --> 00:17:49,766
I tell you, he won't be the only one trying
to top himself if you carry on wi' this caper.

281
00:17:49,852 --> 00:17:52,241
- Dad, I'm hungry.
- (carhorn)

282
00:17:52,332 --> 00:17:54,323

283
00:18:00,172 --> 00:18:02,163
'ey! Lomper!

284
00:18:02,252 --> 00:18:06,530
- Where's me rice?
- Try the cylinder head... tubby.

285
00:18:08,372 --> 00:18:10,363
I don't like Chinese.

286
00:18:10,452 --> 00:18:12,443
Course you do... Don't you?

287
00:18:12,532 --> 00:18:15,524
- Let's see his records.
- What have we got, Dave?

288
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:19,003

289

294
00:18:31,812 --> 00:18:34,121
Stick it on, Daverimo! I'm there.

295
00:18:46,252 --> 00:18:48,812
Dad! Dad, don't.

296
00:18:48,892 --> 00:18:52,771
It's all right, Nathan.
It's right, is this. I've seen 'em do it.

297
00:18:52,852 --> 00:18:56,367
- (amplified) Good evening, shoppers...
- Dave!

298
00:18:56,452 --> 00:18:58,443

 Where didyou come from... (music stops)

309
00:19:50,692 --> 00:19:52,967
- (doorslams)
- I need an audience.

310
00:19:53,052 --> 00:19:55,612
You need a doctor.

311
00:19:58,412 --> 00:20:01,245
(Gaz) I tell you,
there's summat up wi" that kid.

312
00:20:06,052 --> 00:20:09,488
- (Dave) Did you check the whole top end?
- (Gaz) Yeah!

313
00:20:09,572 --> 00:20:11,563
There's no point. He went out.

314
00:20:11,652 --> 00:20:14,007
- You what?
- I seen him go.

315
00:20:14,092 --> 00:20:16,083
There's the beggar.

316
00:20:17,532 --> 00:20:19,284
(Gaz) Oi, Nathe!

317
00:20:19,372 --> 00:20:21,522
Nathan!

318
00:20:21,932 --> 00:20:24,241
Nathan.

319
00:20:26,292 --> 00:20:28,248
Hell-fire!

320
00:20:28,332 --> 00:20:31,642
- What are you doing out here, kid?
- Not. Walking home.

321
00:20:31,732 --> 00:20:34,041
It's miles home! You know that!

322
00:20:34,132 --> 00:20:36,566
Why did you run off like that?

323
00:20:39,652 --> 00:20:41,882
You're embarrassed, aren't you?

324
00:20:41,972 --> 00:20:44,532
You think your own dad's a dickhead.

325
00:20:46,252 --> 00:20:48,925
We're not doing this for a laugh, you know.

326
00:20:49,452 --> 00:20:51,727
I'm trying to get some brass together...

327
00:20:51,812 --> 00:20:54,610
..so as you and me can keep
seeing each other.

328
00:20:55,572 --> 00:20:57,847
They're trying to stop us, you see.

329
00:20:58,452 --> 00:21:00,443
Oh, well, I may as well not bother.

330
00:21:00,532 --> 00:21:02,409
Except I'm your dad.

331
00:21:04,852 --> 00:21:07,320
It counts for something, don't it?

332
00:21:11,452 --> 00:21:13,682
I like you.

333
00:21:15,652 --> 00:21:17,643
I love you, you bugger.

334
00:21:19,892 --> 00:21:21,883
All right, kid?

335
00:21:28,692 --> 00:21:30,683
- All right?
- Yeah.

336
00:21:32,772 --> 00:21:34,763
You nutter.

337
00:21:40,252 --> 00:21:42,129
( tango)

338
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:46,247
(Nathe) Well, you said dancing.

339
00:21:46,332 --> 00:21:48,323
It were a great idea, kid.

340
00:21:48,412 --> 00:21:50,880
Just not the right sort of dancing.

341
00:21:51,652 --> 00:21:53,927
Gaz! 'ey, look "ere. (sniggers)

342
00:21:54,012 --> 00:21:56,003
(Gaz) Oh, my God!

343
00:21:56,092 --> 00:21:59,243
Gerald, me lad, you're gonna be
famous down job club.

344
00:21:59,332 --> 00:22:01,562
(Dave) He's not bad for a bastard, is he?

345
00:22:01,652 --> 00:22:03,847
(Gaz) He's dead, that's what he is.

346
00:22:09,372 --> 00:22:11,840
(Lomper)
You said you wanted a dance teacher.

347
00:22:11,932 --> 00:22:14,127
(Dave) Gerald? Go get chuffed!

348
00:22:14,212 --> 00:22:17,648
He'd tell every bugger!
We'd be laughed out of Sheffield.

349
00:22:18,052 --> 00:22:20,520
'ey up, lads. Bandits at six o"clock.

350
00:22:23,332 --> 00:22:25,323
Ah, come in, Torvill.

351
00:22:25,412 --> 00:22:27,403
Park your sequins over "ere.

352
00:22:27,492 --> 00:22:31,280
- You've had your laugh. Now piss off.
- It's a free country.

353
00:22:31,372 --> 00:22:34,091
- You were rather good. Nifty footwork.
- Gerald!

354
00:22:34,172 --> 00:22:35,764
Oh, hello.

355
00:22:35,852 --> 00:22:40,642
- Gerald, you're missing the rumba.
- Sorry, I just met some pals from... work.

356
00:22:40,732 --> 00:22:42,484
Oh.

357
00:22:42,572 --> 00:22:46,360
- Not thinking of joining our class?
- Funny you should mention it...

358
00:22:46,452 --> 00:22:50,365
- I think we'd better be getting back now.
- Well, good night.

359

You get back to your rumba.
See you later, Gerald.

360
00:22:54,612 --> 00:22:56,603
At work.

361
00:23:15,932 --> 00:23:18,446

362
00:23:18,532 --> 00:23:20,523

- You know, love, I think they just might be.
- Good.

366
00:23:29,452 --> 00:23:31,443
You've been working too hard.

367
00:23:31,532 --> 00:23:35,366
You should let a colleague
do the lion's share for a change.

368
00:23:35,452 --> 00:23:39,001
- I wish you'd be firmer, Gerald.
- Oh, well. Mustn't be late.

369

- So it's all right if I...
- Oh, Linda, love...

370
00:23:42,172 --> 00:23:45,562
Oh, don't be so mean!
Things are looking up. You said so.

371
00:23:45,652 --> 00:23:47,643
You'll love skiing.

- Yes, I bloody am!

377
00:24:15,012 --> 00:24:17,003
Put that back. Put it back!

378
00:24:18,012 --> 00:24:22,005
See that? Interview.
In the bloody bag. Mate from Harrisons.

379
00:24:22,092 --> 00:24:24,083
I could do the job standing on me head.

380
00:24:24,172 --> 00:24:26,891
And I won't have to look at
your ugly mugs again.

381
00:24:26,972 --> 00:24:31,523
- Come on, we just need some help.
- Sorry. There's nothing I can do to help you.

382
00:24:31,612 --> 00:24:33,682
Just wanna know about dancing.

383
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:36,650
Dancers have coordination, skill,...

384
00:24:36,812 --> 00:24:39,372
..timing, fitness and grace.

385
00:24:39,452 --> 00:24:41,841
Take a long, hard look in the mirror.

386
00:24:41,932 --> 00:24:43,923
Now, I'm busy.

387
00:24:45,052 --> 00:24:47,361
Don't be late for job club, lads.

388
00:24:49,052 --> 00:24:50,644

390
00:24:56,852 --> 00:25:00,765
It'll be a relief to get back to work.
It's not been an easy six months.

391

Well, all the qualifications
are there, obviously.

395
00:25:16,252 --> 00:25:19,483
And we go back further

Sorry?

397
00:25:28,212 --> 00:25:30,203
What we're asking, Gerald, is...

398
00:25:30,292 --> 00:25:34,251
..after such a long lay-off,
do you think you're up to the job?

399
00:25:40,612 --> 00:25:41,601
You...!

400

- Fucking hell!

'ey, Gerry, mate...

402
00:25:50,212 --> 00:25:53,488
- (Gaz) You didn't get it, then?
- Get out the way! Come "ere!

403
00:25:53,572 --> 00:25:56,405
Bastard! That were mine, that job!

404
00:25:56,492 --> 00:25:58,562
You don't give a toss! You're kids!

405
00:25:58,652 --> 00:26:02,964
It's different for me!
I've got a standard of living! Responsibilities!

406

I were on me way up! I am on me way up!

407
00:26:07,932 --> 00:26:10,321
It were me first interview in months!

408
00:26:10,412 --> 00:26:15,008
I could've got me first month's in advance.
She'd never have known.

409
00:26:15,092 --> 00:26:17,083
Now what?

410
00:26:17,172 --> 00:26:19,640
She's still got credit cards, you know.

411
00:26:19,732 --> 00:26:25,125
She's out there now, ont' High Street,
with a fucking Barclaycard, spending!

412
00:26:26,172 --> 00:26:28,163
Why can't you just tell her?

413
00:26:28,252 --> 00:26:32,291
How can I tell her after six months?

414
00:26:32,372 --> 00:26:36,285
A woman who wants to go skiing
for us holidays!

415
00:26:39,892 --> 00:26:42,008
(Gerald) Skiing, for fuck's sake!

416
00:26:44,772 --> 00:26:47,570
Why did you do it? It was my job!

417
00:26:47,652 --> 00:26:51,088
It had to be my... job!

Can't you just leave me alone?

420

439
00:29:04,532 --> 00:29:06,841

00:29:06,932 --> 00:29:10,811

- Why do you think we're trailing you?

441
00:29:10,892 --> 00:29:14,931
I don't know. It's not my kind of dancing.
It's all arse wiggling.

442
00:29:15,012 --> 00:29:19,847
I've got a degree in arse wiggling, mate.
You learn us dancing, I'll learn you the rest.

Ask him why he's called the Horse.

474

You bloody ask him!
It's not cos he does the Grand National.

00:32:57,452 --> 00:32:59,443
That's the wall.

514
00:33:05,812 --> 00:33:07,803
(thud)

515
00:33:10,932 --> 00:33:12,923
Oh, well...

516
00:33:13,172 --> 00:33:15,527
It's better than that in the film, you know.

517
00:33:17,452 --> 00:33:20,012
So... you don't sing?

518
00:33:20,092 --> 00:33:21,764
No.

519
00:33:21,852 --> 00:33:25,322
- You don't dance?
- No.

520
00:33:25,412 --> 00:33:29,246
Hope you don't think I'm being nosy,
but... what do you do?

521
00:33:29,332 --> 00:33:31,323
Well, er...

522
00:33:32,052 --> 00:33:34,043
There is... this.

523
00:33:37,492 --> 00:33:39,528
(Gaz gasps)

524
00:33:43,452 --> 00:33:46,888
Gentlemen, the lunchbox... has landed.

525
00:33:52,372 --> 00:33:54,328
Chuffing Nora!

526
00:33:54,412 --> 00:33:56,687
All right, Gerald? I didn't see you!

527
00:33:56,772 --> 00:33:59,127
I did his bathroom.

528
00:34:01,052 --> 00:34:03,043
Hello, Guy.

529
00:34:03,132 --> 00:34:04,804
Nathe...

530
00:34:04,892 --> 00:34:07,042
(Gaz) Nathan!

531
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:13,566
- (Dave) I say, Jean!
- Yeah?

532
00:34:13,652 --> 00:34:15,643
Ever been out with a black bloke?

533
00:34:15,732 --> 00:34:18,565
- You know I haven't, Dave.
- But...

534
00:34:18,652 --> 00:34:21,325
If you were ont' lookout for a new fella, right?

535
00:34:21,412 --> 00:34:23,607
If you were, just saying,...

536
00:34:24,092 --> 00:34:26,083
..would you think about it?

537
00:34:26,172 --> 00:34:28,163
What's got into you?

538
00:34:28,972 --> 00:34:30,963
No, would you, though?

539
00:34:32,052 --> 00:34:34,043
I might do. Yeah.

540
00:34:34,132 --> 00:34:36,123
Is that all right?

541
00:34:36,212 --> 00:34:38,851
- So it's true.
- I've bloody had enough of this.

542
00:34:38,932 --> 00:34:40,923
What's true?

543
00:34:41,012 --> 00:34:43,207
What they say about black blokes.

544
00:34:43,292 --> 00:34:45,442
They've got great bodies and that.

545
00:34:45,532 --> 00:34:47,523
Some of 'em. Yeah.

546
00:34:49,412 --> 00:34:51,562
And?

547
00:34:51,652 --> 00:34:53,643
Nothing.

548
00:34:54,052 --> 00:34:59,570
David... I don't care if they're black,
white, or bloody rainbow-coloured.

549
00:34:59,652 --> 00:35:01,847
I'm married to you. Remember?

550
00:35:01,932 --> 00:35:03,968
Yeah.

551
00:35:07,812 --> 00:35:09,803
Night.

552
00:35:13,332 --> 00:35:15,721
Why would I want anyone else, eh?

553
00:35:16,652 --> 00:35:18,643
Big man.

554
00:35:23,452 --> 00:35:25,602
Jeanie,...

555
00:35:25,692 --> 00:35:27,887
..I'm all in.

556
00:35:30,052 --> 00:35:33,249
It's amazing how tiring it is doing not,
you know.

557
00:36:02,812 --> 00:36:04,803
They're just messing, Dave.

558
00:36:04,892 --> 00:36:07,247
- Do you reckon?
- Course!

559
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:09,607
Just Jean, innit?

560
00:36:11,452 --> 00:36:15,081
- Got any of them mint chocolate jobs?
- Get lost! You're on a diet.

561
00:36:15,172 --> 00:36:18,847
- Don't you start an" all.
- How much you got, then?

562
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:23,003
22... 27 pence.

563
00:36:23,452 --> 00:36:26,728
£4ú.99, special offer.
We're still a fucking fiver short.

564
00:36:26,812 --> 00:36:29,007
You know what this means, Dave?

565
00:36:30,292 --> 00:36:32,283
Oh, no! Come on, Gaz. Why me?

566
00:36:32,372 --> 00:36:36,001
You've got an innocent face.
I've got serial killer written on mine.

567
00:36:36,092 --> 00:36:38,765
If you won't dance,
you can do something useful.

568
00:36:38,852 --> 00:36:41,320
Jean'll throw an eppy! She's only over there!

569
00:36:41,412 --> 00:36:44,609
She's miles away! See you later. Good luck.

570
00:36:45,092 --> 00:36:48,448
- Give us a pear drop, you.
- They're not paid for.

571
00:37:09,372 --> 00:37:11,363
(alarm rings)

572
00:37:14,412 --> 00:37:16,403
(alarm stops)

573
00:37:25,052 --> 00:37:27,247
(alarm rings)

574
00:37:31,692 --> 00:37:33,569
 "Flashdance (WhatA Feeling) "
by Irene Cara

575
00:37:33,652 --> 00:37:36,610
 First, when there's nothing

576
00:37:37,052 --> 00:37:40,010
 Buta slow, glowing dream

577
00:37:40,092 --> 00:37:41,764
Hey, what's this?

578
00:37:41,852 --> 00:37:46,084
I didn't go on the nick in Asda
for some chuffing women's DIY video.

579
00:37:46,172 --> 00:37:48,606
It's "Flashdance", Dave. She's a welder.

580
00:37:48,692 --> 00:37:51,525
(Dave)
I hope she dances better than she welds!

581
00:37:51,612 --> 00:37:54,490
- Look at that! Her mix is all to cock.
- (Gaz) Shut up, Dave.

582
00:37:54,572 --> 00:37:58,042
- What do you know about welding?
- More than some chuffing woman!

583
00:37:58,132 --> 00:38:00,600
It's like Bonfire Night. Too much acetylene.

584
00:38:00,692 --> 00:38:02,648
Them joints won't hold fuck all.

585
00:38:02,732 --> 00:38:05,200
For Christ's sake, we're looking for dancing.

586
00:38:05,292 --> 00:38:07,328
He's got the hump about Asda.

587
00:38:08,212 --> 00:38:10,362
'ey, cop a load of that.

588
00:38:10,452 --> 00:38:12,488
 Whata feeling!

589
00:38:13,692 --> 00:38:16,604
(Gerald) What did I tell you?
She's nifty on her pins.

590
00:38:16,692 --> 00:38:19,889
 You just come alive, you can dance...

591
00:38:19,972 --> 00:38:22,930
That, gentlemen, is what we are looking for.

592
00:38:23,012 --> 00:38:27,005
Oh, aye. I can just see him doing
all that twizzling-about bollocks.

593
00:38:27,092 --> 00:38:31,370
It's souped-up tango, is that.
Teach any bugger in a week. Even you, mate.

594
00:38:31,452 --> 00:38:33,443
Even a fat bastard like me?

595
00:38:33,532 --> 00:38:36,410
Yeah, I know what I am, so don't take the piss.

596
00:38:37,772 --> 00:38:40,684
All right. Two weeks.

597
00:38:40,772 --> 00:38:42,763
(Gerald) Straight up.

598
00:38:44,012 --> 00:38:46,003
 I can have itall

599
00:38:47,652 --> 00:38:49,563
 Please believe it

600
00:38:49,652 --> 00:38:51,643
I dunno, Gaz.

601
00:38:51,732 --> 00:38:55,611
Jean reckons I should take
that security-guard job at Asda.

602
00:38:55,692 --> 00:38:57,683
Jesus! Security?

603
00:38:57,772 --> 00:38:59,842
You're worth more than that, Dave.

604
00:38:59,932 --> 00:39:01,923
She don't think so.

605
00:39:02,012 --> 00:39:05,049
I reckon summat's going on
with her and that bloke.

606
00:39:05,132 --> 00:39:07,123
The juggling bugger?

607
00:39:07,212 --> 00:39:08,804
No. No way.

608
00:39:08,892 --> 00:39:10,883
It's not as if I'd blame her.

609
00:39:10,972 --> 00:39:12,963
You could show her, Dave.

610
00:39:13,052 --> 00:39:17,284
Nobody tells them Chippendales
to do security. Raking it in, they are!

611
00:39:17,372 --> 00:39:21,524
Two weeks. That's what the man said,
and he's not taking the piss.

612
00:39:21,612 --> 00:39:23,807
Aye, it's a thought.

613
00:39:23,892 --> 00:39:25,883
It's more than a thought.

614
00:39:26,012 --> 00:39:29,687
Think of Jean's face when
she sees you dancing like "Flashdance".

615
00:39:30,532 --> 00:39:32,921
Two weeks? Just like flashy tits?

616
00:39:33,452 --> 00:39:35,443
It's what your man said.

617
00:39:36,452 --> 00:39:40,240
'ey... I can weld better than her an" all.

618
00:39:42,492 --> 00:39:44,483
Stop! No, no! Stop! Stop!

619
00:39:44,572 --> 00:39:47,769
- What?
- You stay still!

620
00:39:47,852 --> 00:39:50,969
And you... go forward, OK?!

621
00:39:51,052 --> 00:39:53,043
- OK.
- All right, Nathan.

622
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:56,883
( "Hot Stuff' by Donna Summer)

623
00:39:57,492 --> 00:40:01,371
No, no, no! Jesus Christ!

624
00:40:01,452 --> 00:40:05,445
All I want to do
is get you in a straight bloody line!

625
00:40:05,532 --> 00:40:07,523
What do I have to do?

626
00:40:07,612 --> 00:40:09,921
It's the Arsenal offside trap, int' it?

627
00:40:10,012 --> 00:40:12,287
- You what?
- The Arsenal offside trap.

628
00:40:12,372 --> 00:40:14,806
Lomper here is Tony Adams, right?

629
00:40:14,892 --> 00:40:17,201
Any bugger looks like scoring,...

630
00:40:17,292 --> 00:40:21,683
..we all step forward in a line
and wave our arms around like a fairy.

631
00:40:21,772 --> 00:40:23,330
That's easy.

632
00:40:23,412 --> 00:40:25,243
OK!

633
00:40:25,332 --> 00:40:26,287
Nathan!

634
00:40:28,972 --> 00:40:30,371
 Gotta have some hot stuff

635
00:40:30,452 --> 00:40:32,841
 Gotta have some love tonight

636
00:40:32,932 --> 00:40:34,923
(all) Yes!

637
00:40:35,012 --> 00:40:36,331
Perfect.

638
00:40:36,812 --> 00:40:38,165
Perfect.

639
00:40:38,252 --> 00:40:40,527
Well, you should have said.

640
00:40:44,252 --> 00:40:47,130
Come on. Get in quick, and wipe your boots.

641
00:40:49,612 --> 00:40:53,002
- Put that back. You'll break it.
- I'm just looking.

642
00:40:53,092 --> 00:40:55,083
Bit posh, innit?

643
00:40:55,172 --> 00:40:57,049
(Gaz) Right, then.

644
00:40:57,132 --> 00:40:59,646
- Are we right?
- (Horse) Right for what?

645
00:40:59,732 --> 00:41:01,723
Taking us kit off.

646
00:41:02,892 --> 00:41:05,850
I thought you were turning me
into a fancy dancer.

647
00:41:05,932 --> 00:41:07,968
Ladies, we are strippers, aren't we?

648
00:41:08,052 --> 00:41:10,043
What, here? Now? in this house?

649
00:41:12,132 --> 00:41:16,011
- This is a good area, this is.
- Gaz... I dunno.

650
00:41:16,092 --> 00:41:20,961
If we can't get us kit off in front of ourselves,
what chance have we got in front of lasses?

651
00:41:21,052 --> 00:41:22,849
Tops off.

652
00:41:26,452 --> 00:41:28,841
Come on!

653
00:41:30,612 --> 00:41:34,207
Well, no looking.
And no laughing, you bastards.

654
00:41:43,172 --> 00:41:45,288
I used to have a proper job, me.

655
00:41:46,172 --> 00:41:48,891
I ask you, what are we doing?
What are we doing?

656
00:41:58,172 --> 00:42:00,163
And the kecks.

657
00:42:17,052 --> 00:42:20,362
- Horse by name, horse by nature, eh?
- Oh, shut it, you!

658
00:42:20,452 --> 00:42:23,046
- How come you're so brown?
- No reason.

659
00:42:23,132 --> 00:42:28,081
- Someone's got a sunbed, eh, Gerald!
- It's Linda's, and no, you bloody can't!

660
00:42:28,172 --> 00:42:30,811
What am I gonna do about this?

661
00:42:30,892 --> 00:42:32,848
(Gaz) It's not too bad.

662
00:42:32,932 --> 00:42:35,241
From the front, like.

663
00:42:35,332 --> 00:42:38,210
Fat, David, is a feminist issue.

664
00:42:38,292 --> 00:42:40,283
What's that supposed to mean?

665
00:42:40,372 --> 00:42:43,170
I don't bloody know, do l? But it is.

666
00:42:43,252 --> 00:42:45,402
I try dieting.

667
00:42:47,212 --> 00:42:48,964
I do try!

668
00:42:49,052 --> 00:42:52,362
It seems I've spent
most of me fucking life on a diet!

669
00:42:52,452 --> 00:42:54,522
The less I eat, the fatter I get.

670
00:42:54,612 --> 00:42:57,922
- So stuff yourself and get thin.
- Oh, shut up, saggy tits!

671
00:42:58,012 --> 00:43:00,003
They're not.

672
00:43:00,972 --> 00:43:04,851
A mate of Linda's had this plastic stuff
put on her at this health club.

673
00:43:04,932 --> 00:43:07,844
She lost stones. It were like magic.

674
00:43:07,932 --> 00:43:09,570
Oh, what's it called?

675
00:43:09,652 --> 00:43:11,688
Anyway, it's like... cling film.

676
00:43:11,772 --> 00:43:13,967
- I've heard of that.
- Clingfilm?

677
00:43:14,052 --> 00:43:16,566
I'm not a chicken drumstick, Gerald.

678
00:43:16,652 --> 00:43:21,646
- You wrap it round, reduce the fat...
- She swears by it!

679
00:43:21,732 --> 00:43:23,404
(doorbell)

680
00:43:26,852 --> 00:43:30,162
- You can't just take stuff.
- Sorry, mate.

681
00:43:30,252 --> 00:43:32,243
But I only owe him 120 quid.

682
00:43:32,332 --> 00:43:36,245
- That's all these'll fetch second-hand.
- They're not second-hand.

683
00:43:36,332 --> 00:43:38,323
They are now, mate.

684
00:43:40,052 --> 00:43:42,805
- Put down and piss off.
- Fucking hell!

685
00:43:47,292 --> 00:43:50,967
I think there's been a mistake.
We'll check with the office.

686
00:43:51,052 --> 00:43:53,725
- (door closes)
- Cheers, lads.

687
00:43:53,812 --> 00:43:56,372
It's not bad, this stripping lark, is it?

688
00:43:57,412 --> 00:44:00,688
( 'the Stripper')

689
00:44:06,612 --> 00:44:08,648
(Gerald) Dave and Lomps, up the wing.

690
00:44:08,732 --> 00:44:11,007
One, two, three, four.

691
00:44:11,092 --> 00:44:13,526
Left touchline, three, four.

692
00:44:13,892 --> 00:44:16,122
Right touchline, three, four.

693
00:44:16,212 --> 00:44:18,362
Offside trap. One, two,...

694
00:44:18,452 --> 00:44:21,330
..three, four. Now the belt,...

695
00:44:21,412 --> 00:44:23,448
..three. Now the shoes,...

696
00:44:23,532 --> 00:44:25,887
..three, four. Now the socks...

697
00:44:25,972 --> 00:44:28,850
- Hang on, I can't...
- (Gerald) Carry on!

698
00:44:29,892 --> 00:44:31,928
- Aagh!
- (music stops)

699
00:44:32,012 --> 00:44:34,924
- That were crap.
- (Gerald) Well, give us a chance!

700
00:44:35,012 --> 00:44:37,651
I bet even Madonna has difficulty
with her shoes.

701
00:44:37,732 --> 00:44:39,723
- You could've had me eye out!
- Sorry.

702
00:44:39,812 --> 00:44:42,406
What are you doing? They're borrowed!

703
00:44:42,492 --> 00:44:44,483
We can use 'em for the show.

704
00:44:44,572 --> 00:44:46,767
It's what them Chippendales do.

705
00:44:46,852 --> 00:44:49,491
They put Velcro down the side,
and then... (rips)

706
00:44:49,572 --> 00:44:51,528
..they're off! I'll sew 'em back up.

707
00:44:51,612 --> 00:44:53,842
Where did you learn to be an ace sewer?

708
00:44:53,932 --> 00:44:55,411
Prison.

709
00:44:58,332 --> 00:45:00,323
Cheers, Nathe.

710
00:45:04,052 --> 00:45:06,043
Come on, Al, it's me!

711
00:45:06,132 --> 00:45:09,761
Which is precisely why
it's 100 quid up front. Half-price.

712
00:45:09,852 --> 00:45:15,245
If I give you t" club for not and you don't
turn up, I've an empty bar on a Friday night.

713
00:45:15,332 --> 00:45:18,210
Course we'll turn up! I haven't got 100 quid!

714
00:45:20,132 --> 00:45:23,363
If you tell me what you're up to,
it might help.

715
00:45:24,292 --> 00:45:26,283
I can't. It's top-secret.

716
00:45:27,372 --> 00:45:29,363
Sorry...

717
00:45:38,332 --> 00:45:40,402
(Gaz laughs)

718
00:45:42,972 --> 00:45:44,963
- All right, love?
- Hi, Mum.

719
00:45:45,052 --> 00:45:47,612
- What do you want?
- All right, Mand?

720
00:45:47,892 --> 00:45:50,087
I'm gonna get you all your money.

721
00:45:50,172 --> 00:45:53,847
Our money. Nathan's.
You know, for definite this time.

722
00:45:53,932 --> 00:45:56,810
- Yeah, right. That all?
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

723
00:45:59,292 --> 00:46:04,002
Well, no. The thing is, Mand, you have
to speculate to accumulate, in business.

724
00:46:04,092 --> 00:46:08,244
- I'm not sure I'm hearing this.
- I'll get you it all. I just need a tiny bit.

725
00:46:08,332 --> 00:46:10,641
- You want some money?
- Yeah!

726
00:46:10,732 --> 00:46:13,929
Right. I need someone int' packing section.

727
00:46:14,012 --> 00:46:17,641
£2.50 an hour. You can start now,
if you like. Are you coming?

728
00:46:19,692 --> 00:46:21,045
Come on, Dad.

729
00:46:23,972 --> 00:46:25,291
Nathan.

730
00:46:25,372 --> 00:46:28,205
You can't do this, kid. It's your savings.

731
00:46:28,292 --> 00:46:31,250
I can. I just need your signature.
It says int' book.

732
00:46:31,332 --> 00:46:33,368
I'd like to take my money out, please.

733
00:46:33,452 --> 00:46:35,443
Well, you bloody well can't.

734
00:46:35,532 --> 00:46:38,649
- You're all right, love. It's sorted.
- It's my money!

735
00:46:38,732 --> 00:46:40,211
£100, please.

736
00:46:40,292 --> 00:46:43,648
When you're 18,
you can walk in and get it yourself.

737
00:46:43,732 --> 00:46:46,405
- You said you'd get it back.
- I know!

738
00:46:46,492 --> 00:46:49,211
But you don't want to listen to what I say.

739
00:46:49,292 --> 00:46:52,523
You said so. I believe you.

740
00:46:52,612 --> 00:46:54,807
You do?

741
00:46:54,892 --> 00:46:57,406
Yeah.

742
00:46:58,772 --> 00:47:00,842
Blimey, Nathe!

 'make Me Smile (Come Up And See Me) "
by Steve Harleyand CockneyRebel

744
00:47:07,532 --> 00:47:09,602
 You've done it all

745
00:47:09,692 --> 00:47:12,889
 You've broken every code

746
00:47:12,972 --> 00:47:16,282
Come on, come on! One, two!

747
00:47:16,372 --> 00:47:19,125
 Pulled the rebel to the floor

748
00:47:20,492 --> 00:47:23,086
 You've spoilt the game

749
00:47:23,172 --> 00:47:26,448
 No matter what you say

750
00:47:27,052 --> 00:47:28,770
And one for luck!

751
00:47:28,852 --> 00:47:32,811
 What a bore

752
00:47:34,092 --> 00:47:36,686
 Blue eyes, blue eyes

753
00:47:36,772 --> 00:47:42,688
 How can you tell so many lies?

754
00:47:43,812 --> 00:47:45,803
 Come up and see me

755
00:47:45,892 --> 00:47:49,726
 Make me smile

756
00:47:50,052 --> 00:47:52,043
 I'll do what you want

757
00:47:52,132 --> 00:47:56,284
 Running wild

758
00:47:56,372 --> 00:47:57,600

759
00:48:20,692 --> 00:48:22,842
Yeah!

760
00:48:26,612 --> 00:48:28,284
 Oooh

761
00:48:28,372 --> 00:48:29,805
 La-la-la

762
00:48:29,892 --> 00:48:31,803
 Oooh

 La-la-la

764
00:48:32,932 --> 00:48:34,923
 Ooooooh

765
00:48:35,852 --> 00:48:37,843
(Dave) It's not straight, Lomps.

766
00:48:37,932 --> 00:48:40,162
Give over, it's only a poster.

767
00:48:43,532 --> 00:48:45,887
Christ al-bloody-mighty!

768
00:48:47,932 --> 00:48:50,526
- All right, sweethearts?
- (woman) Gary the lad!

769
00:48:50,612 --> 00:48:52,603
What are you up to, then, shifty?

770
00:48:52,692 --> 00:48:55,445
Bit of this, bit of that, bit of the other.

771
00:48:57,172 --> 00:49:00,403
- (Gaz) Just advertising for some mates.
- Oh, aye.

772
00:49:00,492 --> 00:49:02,767
And who's gonna come and see
your mates?

773
00:49:02,852 --> 00:49:05,446
We had the real thing up here the other day.

774
00:49:05,532 --> 00:49:07,807
Well, us mates are better.

775
00:49:07,892 --> 00:49:11,680
- Better? How's that, then?
- Well...

776
00:49:13,092 --> 00:49:15,367
This lot go all the way.

777
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:19,081
- Don't they, lads?
- The full monty? You lot?

778
00:49:20,532 --> 00:49:22,921
Hell-fire! That would be worth a look!

779
00:49:23,012 --> 00:49:24,968
- See you there, then.
- Ta-ra.

780
00:49:25,052 --> 00:49:26,201
(women laugh)

781
00:49:26,292 --> 00:49:28,044
Keep your hair on.

782
00:49:28,132 --> 00:49:30,930
No way. No and never. In that order, kid.

783
00:49:31,012 --> 00:49:35,210
Excuse me, no-one said anything to me
about the full monty.

784
00:49:35,292 --> 00:49:39,285
You heard 'em. We've gotta give them
more than your average ten-bob stripper.

785
00:49:39,372 --> 00:49:43,047
- Yeah, but... me willy. I mean to say...
- Your willy?!

786
00:49:43,132 --> 00:49:46,010
- My willy!
- A laughing stock. Totally!

787
00:49:46,092 --> 00:49:49,846
- Well, they're coming!
- With a pair of scissors! They know it's us.

788
00:49:49,932 --> 00:49:54,210
By closing time, every bugger in Sheffield
will know it's us whether we do it or not.

789
00:49:54,292 --> 00:49:57,011
We can forget it,
go back to fucking job club,...

790
00:49:57,092 --> 00:49:59,048
..or do it and just maybe get rich.

791
00:49:59,132 --> 00:50:01,043
And I tell you,...

792
00:50:01,132 --> 00:50:04,761
..folks don't laugh so loud
when you've a grand in your pocket.

793
00:50:05,372 --> 00:50:07,363
Now, are you in...

794
00:50:07,452 --> 00:50:09,568
..or are you out?

795
00:50:09,772 --> 00:50:11,649
(traffic news on radio)

796
00:50:11,732 --> 00:50:15,486
..all sorts of problems
for drivers on the Pennines.

797
00:50:16,252 --> 00:50:18,766
So, please avoid the area if possible.

798
00:50:18,852 --> 00:50:23,164
The good news is that the outlook
for the rest of the week is much better,...

799
00:50:23,252 --> 00:50:27,609
..with the storms clearing
to leave the weekend warm and sunny.

800
00:50:27,692 --> 00:50:31,731
Now, back to the music.
Here's another disco classic from the '70s.

801
00:50:31,812 --> 00:50:33,291
It's Donna Summer with...

802
00:50:33,372 --> 00:50:35,363
.."Hot Stuff'.

803

804
00:50:43,652 --> 00:50:47,440
 Sitting here eating my heart out, waiting

805
00:50:47,532 --> 00:50:50,171
 Waiting for some lover to call

806
00:50:51,412 --> 00:50:55,166
 Dialed about a thousand numbers lately

807
00:50:55,252 --> 00:50:57,607
 Almost rang the phone off the wall

808
00:50:58,212 --> 00:51:02,000
 Looking for some hot stuff,
baby, this evening

809
00:51:02,092 --> 00:51:05,801
 I need some hot stuff, baby, tonight

 Gotta have some hot stuff

812
00:51:12,052 --> 00:51:15,886
 Gotta have some love tonight

 I need hot stuff

 I want some hot stuff

00:51:24,612 --> 00:51:26,603
(rain pouring down)

816
00:51:32,412 --> 00:51:34,004
No.

( "We Are Family" by Sister Sledge)

819

You've got some fit birds in there.

820
00:51:45,252 --> 00:51:47,243
Nah. Tits are too big.

821
00:51:47,332 --> 00:51:48,924
(Horse) Yeah?

822
00:51:49,012 --> 00:51:50,411
Didn't know they could be.

823
00:51:52,772 --> 00:51:54,763
Anti-wrinkle cream.

824
00:51:54,852 --> 00:51:57,412

Do you mind, you!

826
00:52:00,612 --> 00:52:05,766
Well, I just pray they're a bit more
understanding about us, that's all.

827
00:52:05,852 --> 00:52:07,843
You what?

828
00:52:07,932 --> 00:52:10,605
They're gonna be looking at us like that.

829
00:52:12,612 --> 00:52:16,605
What if, next Friday, 4ú00 women say:
"He's too fat, he's too old,...

830
00:52:16,692 --> 00:52:19,490
..and he's a pigeon-chested little tosser."

831
00:52:19,572 --> 00:52:22,609
- They wouldn't.
- Why not? He said her tits are too big.

832
00:52:22,692 --> 00:52:25,252
That's different. We're... blokes.

833
00:52:25,332 --> 00:52:26,924
(Dave) Yeah. And?

834
00:52:27,012 --> 00:52:29,128
I think she's got nice tits.

835
00:52:29,212 --> 00:52:32,761
I never said owt about her personality.
She's probably quite nice.

836
00:52:32,852 --> 00:52:35,241
They won't say not
about your personality.

837
00:52:35,332 --> 00:52:37,448
Which is good cos you're a bastard.

838
00:52:37,532 --> 00:52:41,047
Bollocks to your personality!
This is what they're looking at.

839
00:52:41,132 --> 00:52:43,327
And I tell you summat, mate.

840
00:52:43,412 --> 00:52:47,724
Anti-wrinkle cream there may be,
but anti-fat-bastard cream, there is none.

841
00:52:48,852 --> 00:52:50,649
(Guy) Here... Iads.

842
00:52:56,332 --> 00:52:58,368
Oh, mother!

843
00:52:58,452 --> 00:53:01,922
- Bloody hell!
- Gaz said he wanted something a bit flashy.

844
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:04,606
It's top of thee range. Real leather.

845
00:53:04,692 --> 00:53:06,205
Yeah, but...

846
00:53:06,292 --> 00:53:08,726
- You don't get much.
- (Horse) What day is it?

847
00:53:08,812 --> 00:53:11,167
- Monday.
- When are we on?

848
00:53:11,252 --> 00:53:14,483
Friday. Dress rehearsal tomorrow.

849
00:53:17,332 --> 00:53:19,323
I think I'm gonna be sick.

850
00:53:25,692 --> 00:53:29,002
How can I read the instructions?
There wasn't any.

851
00:53:29,092 --> 00:53:31,970
No? Well, maybe there's a part missing.

852
00:53:32,052 --> 00:53:35,442
Yeah, I got that. If that's what you call it.

853
00:53:35,532 --> 00:53:38,410
Well, if it's all there,
how come it's not working?

854
00:53:41,492 --> 00:53:43,767
What do you mean, in what sense?

855
00:53:43,852 --> 00:53:47,242
It's not working
in the sense that it's not working.

856
00:53:47,332 --> 00:53:49,323
No, I can't speak up.

857
00:53:49,412 --> 00:53:53,371
Nothing's happening, you know what I mean?
Nothing's getting bigger.

858
00:53:53,452 --> 00:53:55,920
Well, this is an emergency, is this.

859
00:54:44,412 --> 00:54:46,403
What's the matter, big man?

860
00:54:49,852 --> 00:54:51,843
I'm sorry.

861
00:54:58,492 --> 00:55:00,483
Dave...

862
00:55:03,932 --> 00:55:05,923

864
00:55:10,132 --> 00:55:12,646
 Wanna bring a wild man back home

865
00:55:12,732 --> 00:55:16,771
 Gonna have some hot love,
baby, this evening

866
00:55:16,852 --> 00:55:19,320
 I need some hot love, baby, tonight...

867
00:55:19,412 --> 00:55:21,403
You're ahead.

868
00:55:21,772 --> 00:55:23,649
- (music off)
- Give us a break!

869
00:55:26,812 --> 00:55:28,803
All right, kid.

870
00:55:30,332 --> 00:55:32,323
Tell us straight.

871
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:36,564
We're not making the biggest arses
of ourselves in the known universe, are we?

872
00:56:43,052 --> 00:56:44,929
Dave, mate.

873
00:56:45,012 --> 00:56:48,846
Can I have a word? ln private, like.

874
00:56:50,012 --> 00:56:52,572
Yeah. I suppose so.

875
00:56:52,652 --> 00:56:55,041
Dave, you won't tell anyone, will you?

876
00:56:55,132 --> 00:56:58,124
No, your, er... Your secret's safe with me.

877
00:57:01,212 --> 00:57:03,407
When I were about 12,...

878
00:57:03,492 --> 00:57:07,371
..our school took us for...
for swimming lessons.

879
00:57:07,452 --> 00:57:09,682
Mixed classes.

880
00:57:09,772 --> 00:57:11,763
You know, boys...

881
00:57:11,852 --> 00:57:13,843
..and... er...

882
00:57:13,932 --> 00:57:16,651
..and girls.

883
00:57:19,172 --> 00:57:20,685
Oh...

884
00:57:20,772 --> 00:57:23,286
It were terrible, Dave. I were there...

885
00:57:23,372 --> 00:57:25,932
..standing at t" side oft" pool in me trunks...

886
00:57:26,012 --> 00:57:29,288
..with all these pretty lassies
around in bikinis!

887
00:57:29,372 --> 00:57:31,363
And... Well, l...

888
00:57:31,452 --> 00:57:33,568

889
00:57:39,012 --> 00:57:41,207
I got a stiffy!

890
00:57:41,292 --> 00:57:44,682
- What did you do?
- I jumped into t" deep end.

891
00:57:44,772 --> 00:57:46,763
I nearly fucking drowned!

892
00:57:46,852 --> 00:57:48,843
What if it happens again?

893
00:57:48,932 --> 00:57:51,321
Think of that, eh? In front of 400 women!

894
00:57:51,412 --> 00:57:53,368
Gerald,...

895
00:57:53,452 --> 00:57:55,647
..you're talking to t" wrong man.

896
00:58:01,812 --> 00:58:05,327
- (Gerald) You said it were just your mum.
- (Horse) It's family.

897
00:58:05,412 --> 00:58:08,643
- What can you do?
- Who the hell-fire's that?

898
00:58:09,452 --> 00:58:11,443
(Horse) Oh, no.

899
00:58:11,532 --> 00:58:13,409
It's Beryl.

900
00:58:13,492 --> 00:58:15,483
Me niece!

901
00:58:16,212 --> 00:58:18,203
Where's Dave?

902
00:58:23,652 --> 00:58:25,529
"Ere, Dave!

903
00:58:25,612 --> 00:58:27,011
Dave!

904
00:58:27,092 --> 00:58:29,447
- What are you doing?
- What does it look like?

905
00:58:29,532 --> 00:58:32,729
We're on in three days" time!
Where the fuck are you?!

906
00:58:32,812 --> 00:58:35,451
I'm "ere, working! Earning! That's where.

907
00:58:35,532 --> 00:58:37,523
Not pissing about!

908
00:58:37,612 --> 00:58:39,443
End of chat.

909
00:58:40,972 --> 00:58:42,803
Dave.

910
00:58:42,892 --> 00:58:45,087
- Come on, Dave.
- No.

911
00:58:45,172 --> 00:58:47,003
All right, then.

912
00:58:47,092 --> 00:58:50,528
- Oooh, very nice.
- Gaz, please, don't.

913
00:58:50,612 --> 00:58:53,684
- Come on, Mr Security Guard. Do your job.
- Gazza!

914
00:58:53,772 --> 00:58:56,764
(Gerald)
Horse, go out and tell 'em there's a delay.

915
00:58:56,852 --> 00:58:58,888
(Horse) They won't wait for ever.

916
00:59:11,852 --> 00:59:13,843
Keep up, you fat bastard!

917
00:59:13,932 --> 00:59:15,923
(alarm rings)

918
00:59:18,052 --> 00:59:21,010
Don't ever call me a fat bastard, all right?!

919
00:59:21,092 --> 00:59:23,481
- All right?!
- We need you, Dave.

920
00:59:26,252 --> 00:59:28,243
I can't.

921
00:59:31,052 --> 00:59:34,362
I just can't. All right?

922
00:59:35,932 --> 00:59:40,323
Listen, just think of thee most boring thing
you can come up with.

923
00:59:40,412 --> 00:59:43,006
- That should keep it well in order.
- Like what?

924
00:59:43,092 --> 00:59:46,562
- Double-glazing salesmen.
- Gardening. The Queen's speech.

925
00:59:46,652 --> 00:59:48,563
(Guy) A Dire Straits double album.

926
00:59:48,652 --> 00:59:51,689
- Nature programmes.
- I like nature programmes.

927
00:59:51,772 --> 00:59:55,367
Aye, but they don't give you a hard-on,
though, do they?

928
00:59:55,452 --> 00:59:57,044
- Do they?
- (sniggering)

929
00:59:57,132 --> 01:00:00,408
- Blimey...
- Oh, shut up! It's not funny. It's medical.

930
01:00:00,492 --> 01:00:02,323
(door opens)

931
01:00:05,492 --> 01:00:07,687
He's not coming.

932
01:00:09,732 --> 01:00:11,802
It's all right. We can do without him.

934
01:00:14,012 --> 01:00:15,411

01:01:50,789 --> 01:01:52,905
So your daddy dances in front of you?

952
01:01:52,989 --> 01:01:55,549
When he's rehearsing.

953
01:02:00,829 --> 01:02:03,548
We were dancing all right then, an" all.

954
01:02:03,629 --> 01:02:05,699
My feet are freezing.

955
01:02:05,789 --> 01:02:08,349

(baby cries)

963
01:02:48,789 --> 01:02:51,383
Told you. Robbing pipes, that's all.

964
01:02:51,469 --> 01:02:53,460
Gary, my friend,...

965
01:02:53,549 --> 01:02:55,619
..no bugger robs pipes in the buff.

966
01:02:55,709 --> 01:02:57,461
We do.

967
01:02:57,549 --> 01:02:59,619
Don't get your clothes dirty, do you?

968
01:02:59,709 --> 01:03:04,339
Oh. Well, don't fret, gents. There's
a right good laundry in Wakefield prison.

969
01:03:04,429 --> 01:03:06,420
Eh?

970
01:03:08,949 --> 01:03:11,588
Security-camera tapes off the front desk.

971
01:03:11,669 --> 01:03:13,739
What happened to the security guard?

972
01:03:19,389 --> 01:03:22,620
(laughter)

973
01:03:24,469 --> 01:03:26,460
You're always ahead there.

974
01:03:26,549 --> 01:03:29,109
You're always bloody behind, more like.

975
01:03:29,189 --> 01:03:32,067
Look... Excuse me,
can I borrow this for a second?

976
01:03:32,149 --> 01:03:33,787
(giggling)

977
01:03:33,869 --> 01:03:36,337
Look, shut up, will you?! Watch.

978
01:03:39,669 --> 01:03:41,660
(inspector) He's right.

979
01:03:41,749 --> 01:03:44,468
- You're ahead.
- Oh, go... bollocks!

980
01:03:53,069 --> 01:03:55,060
- (giggling)
- Ssh!

981
01:03:57,429 --> 01:03:59,420
(dog barks)

982
01:04:00,069 --> 01:04:01,138
Ooh!

983
01:04:05,229 --> 01:04:07,220
Ssh! Be quiet! Me mum'll hear.

984
01:04:07,309 --> 01:04:10,301
- I've always wanted to meet your mum.
- Ssh!

985
01:04:19,669 --> 01:04:23,344
What do you mean, I can't see him?
He's me son! I haven't been charged!

986
01:04:23,429 --> 01:04:25,420
Ask Smiler in there! No charge!

987
01:04:25,509 --> 01:04:28,899
Sorry. Social Services have requested
an interview with you.

988
01:04:28,989 --> 01:04:31,549
Have to make an appointment.

989
01:04:35,669 --> 01:04:38,581
- I've come to pick up my son.
- Oh, right. Er...

990
01:04:38,669 --> 01:04:40,580
Just a minute.

991
01:04:40,669 --> 01:04:42,899
He's fine. We've not been charged or owt.

992
01:04:42,989 --> 01:04:46,584
So this is your great money-making
enterprise? Pornography?

993
01:04:46,669 --> 01:04:48,864
Don't be daft! We're getting your money.

994
01:04:48,949 --> 01:04:50,940
My money?! Nathan's money!

995
01:04:51,029 --> 01:04:53,259
- (inspector) Here he is.
- All right, Dad?

996
01:04:53,349 --> 01:04:55,988
- All right, kid?
- Yeah, fine. Hi, Mum.

997
01:04:56,069 --> 01:04:57,707
Come on, love.

998
01:04:57,789 --> 01:04:59,586
We're going now.

999
01:04:59,669 --> 01:05:01,660
- Come on, Mand!
- Unemployed,...

1000
01:05:01,749 --> 01:05:06,061
..maintenance arrears of£700,
and now an arrest for indecent exposure.

1001
01:05:06,149 --> 01:05:08,709
- Still think you're a good father?
- He is trying.

1002
01:05:08,789 --> 01:05:10,939
- See?
- A bit late for that.

1003
01:05:11,029 --> 01:05:13,907
- Hang on a minute!
- Look at yourself, Gary!

1004
01:05:13,989 --> 01:05:15,980
Just look at yourself.

1005
01:05:51,549 --> 01:05:53,540
All right, mate?

1006
01:05:54,269 --> 01:05:56,499
So.

1007
01:05:57,829 --> 01:05:59,820
And this has been going on how long?

1008
01:06:03,749 --> 01:06:05,740
About six months.

1009
01:06:12,269 --> 01:06:14,544
I can cope with losing the sunbed.

1010
01:06:14,629 --> 01:06:16,620
Car. Television.

1011
01:06:17,069 --> 01:06:21,108
I can even cope with the shame
of everyone watching this.

1012
01:06:21,189 --> 01:06:24,465
But six months! Six bloody months!

1013
01:06:24,549 --> 01:06:26,585
And you wouldn't say to me,...

1014
01:06:27,709 --> 01:06:29,859
..to your wife.

1015
01:06:33,189 --> 01:06:35,180
I thought you liked them.

1016
01:06:36,469 --> 01:06:38,744
No, Gerald. I've never liked 'em.

1017
01:06:50,709 --> 01:06:52,700
(knock at door)

1018
01:07:02,909 --> 01:07:06,379
They've taken me sunbed.
They've taken bloody everything.

1019
01:07:06,469 --> 01:07:09,381
- Kept hold of your chips, though.
- House repossessed.

1020
01:07:09,469 --> 01:07:11,266
Wife thrown me out.

1021
01:07:11,349 --> 01:07:13,146
Guess what.

1022
01:07:13,229 --> 01:07:15,185
I've just been offered that job.

1023
01:07:16,269 --> 01:07:18,100
Congratulations.

1024
01:07:25,509 --> 01:07:27,500
- All right, kid?
- Hiya!

1025
01:07:27,589 --> 01:07:29,784

1026
01:07:29,869 --> 01:07:31,461

1027
01:07:32,069 --> 01:07:33,866
Nathe.

1028
01:07:33,949 --> 01:07:35,348
Hi ya. All right, love?

1029
01:07:35,429 --> 01:07:36,828
You shouldn't be here.

1030
01:07:36,909 --> 01:07:40,265
- Says who?
- Read the lawyer's letter, why don't you?

1031
01:07:41,909 --> 01:07:44,707
We're going swimming, Dad.
Do you wanna come?

1032
01:07:47,229 --> 01:07:49,106
I can't, kid.

1033
01:07:49,189 --> 01:07:51,145
Haven't brought me trunks, have l?

1034
01:07:51,229 --> 01:07:55,017
- We can go get 'em. Can't we, Mum?
- I can't, love.

1035
01:07:55,109 --> 01:07:56,098
Why?

1036
01:07:57,829 --> 01:07:59,820
I just...

1037
01:08:01,269 --> 01:08:03,260
I just can't. Sorry.

1038
01:08:04,469 --> 01:08:06,937
He's not allowed, is he?

1039
01:08:10,709 --> 01:08:12,700
Come on, love.

1040
01:08:48,869 --> 01:08:50,541
(whispers) Dave!

1041
01:08:50,629 --> 01:08:52,620
Oi, you deaftwat!

1042
01:08:52,709 --> 01:08:55,542
What do you want now?
I told you, I'm finished with you.

1043
01:08:55,629 --> 01:08:57,620
We're all finished, Dave.

1044
01:08:57,709 --> 01:08:59,586
I'm a bloody marked man now.

1045
01:09:01,749 --> 01:09:04,900
Sorry about your Nathan. It's a bad one, that.

1046
01:09:04,989 --> 01:09:06,980
Aye.

1047
01:09:07,309 --> 01:09:09,300
It's about Lomper.

1048
01:09:09,389 --> 01:09:11,744
What's that pasty-faced chuffer want?

1049
01:09:11,829 --> 01:09:13,820
His mum died two days ago.

1050
01:09:13,909 --> 01:09:15,900
Ah.

1051
01:09:16,669 --> 01:09:18,739
Poor lad. Sorry.

1052
01:09:18,829 --> 01:09:21,821
- Could you borrow us a jacket for t" funeral?
- Gaz...!

1053
01:09:21,909 --> 01:09:24,946
Come on, Dave!
It's not for me, it's a funeral!

1054
01:09:27,909 --> 01:09:29,900
What colour?

1055
01:09:30,789 --> 01:09:32,541
Orange.

1056
01:09:32,629 --> 01:09:35,302
- Orange?
- Black, for fuck's sake!

1057
01:09:35,389 --> 01:09:38,665
All right. Look, I'll meet you by t" doors.

1058
01:09:49,069 --> 01:09:52,027
- Nice one.
- Come on, then.

1059
01:09:52,109 --> 01:09:54,464
- Have you got some time off?
- Nah.

1060
01:09:54,549 --> 01:09:57,109
Fucking pick'n'mix
were driving me crazy.

1061
01:09:57,189 --> 01:09:59,180
Besides, it's a funeral.

1062
01:09:59,269 --> 01:10:02,067
- Are you ready?
- Ready when you are.

1063
01:10:04,589 --> 01:10:06,580
- (alarm rings)
- Yaaa!

1064
01:10:08,309 --> 01:10:10,698
( "Abide With Me')

1065
01:10:21,829 --> 01:10:23,820
(band members join in)

1066
01:11:09,469 --> 01:11:11,585
(Gaz) They bloody are, you know.

1067
01:11:11,669 --> 01:11:13,625
They're holding hands.

1068
01:11:13,709 --> 01:11:16,143
- They're never.
- Straight up.

1069
01:11:17,069 --> 01:11:19,458
I never even hold hands with ruddy lassies.

1070
01:11:19,549 --> 01:11:21,380
Maybe I should.

1071
01:11:21,469 --> 01:11:25,303
Ah, who'd have ruddy thought it, eh?

1072
01:11:27,429 --> 01:11:30,227
Ah, well. There's not as queer as folk.

1073
01:11:33,069 --> 01:11:35,742
I said, 'there's not as queer as folk"!

1074
01:11:35,829 --> 01:11:38,741
Shut up, Dave.
It's supposed to be a bloody funeral.

1075
01:11:38,829 --> 01:11:41,423
I'm sorry.

1076
01:11:49,669 --> 01:11:52,388
- (girl) 'ey, look! Who's that?
- It's that guy!

1077
01:11:52,469 --> 01:11:54,460
Show us your pecs!

1078
01:11:54,549 --> 01:11:56,619
(whooping)

1079
01:11:57,269 --> 01:12:00,227
(girl) They were together in the paper,
weren't they?

1080
01:12:04,469 --> 01:12:08,178
Have you been actively seeking work
over the last fortnight?

1081
01:12:08,269 --> 01:12:09,463
Yeah.

1082
01:12:09,549 --> 01:12:12,939
Have you done any work,
paid or unpaid, over the last fortnight?

1083
01:12:13,029 --> 01:12:14,587
No.

1084
01:12:16,549 --> 01:12:19,109
That's not what I've heard.

1085
01:13:05,829 --> 01:13:08,548
Right, come on, you lot!

1086
01:13:11,029 --> 01:13:12,667
'slaidburn."

1087
01:13:15,869 --> 01:13:18,622
One, two, three, four.

1088
01:13:20,669 --> 01:13:22,580
( 'the Stripper')

1089
01:13:53,469 --> 01:13:55,460
(men hum 'the Stripper')

1090
01:13:56,269 --> 01:13:58,988
- Go get shagged!
- Get your knickers off!

1091
01:14:01,309 --> 01:14:03,300
(car horn)

1092
01:14:03,789 --> 01:14:05,780
Oh, fuck!

1093
01:14:06,069 --> 01:14:08,060
Hey, Patricia the Stripper!

1094
01:14:08,829 --> 01:14:11,787
- Bugger off.
- Where have you bloody been?

1095
01:14:11,869 --> 01:14:15,464
What's going on? I had to buy 20 barrels!
I've had no word from you!

1096
01:14:15,549 --> 01:14:17,699
I hope they're sale or return.

1097
01:14:17,789 --> 01:14:20,542
You're joking! You're bloody famous!

1098
01:14:20,629 --> 01:14:22,824
Yeah, don't remind me.

1099
01:14:22,909 --> 01:14:26,424
- I've sold 200-odd tickets!
- How many?

1100
01:14:26,509 --> 01:14:28,500
Well done, Gerald. All the best.

1101
01:14:28,589 --> 01:14:30,659
Hey! Example for you there!

1102
01:14:35,149 --> 01:14:37,947
- Nice suit, Gerald!
- Yeah.

1103
01:14:38,029 --> 01:14:40,020
(Gerald) Well, l... I'd best be off.

1104
01:14:40,109 --> 01:14:43,624
You never know,
there might be a job in it for you boys.

1105
01:14:43,709 --> 01:14:45,700
- All right, lads?
- All right, Gaz?

1106
01:14:45,789 --> 01:14:48,349
- Gareth.
- We're on.

1107
01:14:48,429 --> 01:14:50,385
We're bloody on!

1108
01:14:50,469 --> 01:14:54,144
- You what?
- We've sold 200 tickets. That's two grand!

1109
01:14:54,229 --> 01:14:57,665
(Gerald) It's a bit late for all that, Gaz.
I mean...

1110
01:14:57,749 --> 01:14:59,740
I mean fresh start, you know.

1111
01:14:59,829 --> 01:15:01,820
One more time, Gerald.

1112
01:15:01,909 --> 01:15:05,026
You've got the rest of your fucking life
to wear a suit!

1113
01:15:05,109 --> 01:15:07,100
- (Horse) Gerald...
- (Guy) Aye, go on!

1114
01:15:07,189 --> 01:15:08,668
Come on, Gerald.

1115
01:15:11,789 --> 01:15:13,780
- Just once.
- Yes!

1116
01:15:13,869 --> 01:15:16,019
That's all. Just tonight.

1117
01:15:17,749 --> 01:15:19,899
How about it, Dave?

1118
01:15:20,909 --> 01:15:23,377
Haven't you grown out of all that yet?

1119
01:15:23,469 --> 01:15:25,699
Come on, mate.

1120
01:15:26,829 --> 01:15:29,218
Nah. Sorry, lads.

1121
01:15:37,309 --> 01:15:39,300
Jean?

1122
01:15:41,109 --> 01:15:43,100
Jean, love!

1123
01:15:43,189 --> 01:15:45,180
(footsteps on stairs)

1124
01:15:49,909 --> 01:15:51,900
There you are.

1125
01:15:56,269 --> 01:16:00,057
I should have guessed
when you started wearing totty lotion.

1126
01:16:00,149 --> 01:16:02,140
You never put it on for me, did you?

1127
01:16:03,069 --> 01:16:05,060
- Jean?
- Or this?

1128
01:16:06,709 --> 01:16:09,701
I never had you down
for this sort of caper, David.

1129
01:16:10,709 --> 01:16:13,303
It explains a few things, at least.

1130
01:16:13,389 --> 01:16:15,744
No, look...
I know it don't look good.

1131
01:16:15,829 --> 01:16:17,945
You're bloody right it don't.

1132
01:16:19,069 --> 01:16:21,708
All those nights you were late back...

1133
01:16:21,789 --> 01:16:25,668
..and stupid cow here thought
you were out looking for a job!

1134
01:16:25,749 --> 01:16:27,705
Well, no wonder.

1135
01:16:27,789 --> 01:16:29,780
No bloody wonder.

1136
01:16:29,989 --> 01:16:33,220
- It's so obvious.
- No, I were with Gaz, honest.

1137
01:16:33,309 --> 01:16:36,938
Oh, right!
She's one of Gaz's little tarts, is she?

1138
01:16:37,029 --> 01:16:39,020
Well, that makes sense.

1139
01:16:39,109 --> 01:16:41,782
She'd have to be
to put up with this kind of shit!

1140
01:16:45,189 --> 01:16:49,023
Just listen, will you?!
It's not to do with any fucking women!

1141
01:16:51,149 --> 01:16:53,140
I'm...

1142
01:16:53,229 --> 01:16:55,220
I were a stripper, right?

1143
01:16:55,309 --> 01:17:00,861
Me and Gaz and... some fellas thought
we'd make a bob or two taking us clothes off.

1144
01:17:03,109 --> 01:17:05,100
Strippers?

1145
01:17:05,189 --> 01:17:07,259
All right, all right, I know.

1146
01:17:07,349 --> 01:17:10,068
You... and Gaz?

1147
01:17:10,149 --> 01:17:12,140
Strippers?

1148
01:17:12,229 --> 01:17:14,220
We weren't that bad.

1149
01:17:16,189 --> 01:17:18,464
Only I couldn't, could l?

1150
01:17:18,549 --> 01:17:20,540
Why not?

1151
01:17:21,509 --> 01:17:23,500
Well, look at me.

1152
01:17:25,469 --> 01:17:27,460
So?

1153
01:17:28,549 --> 01:17:31,109
Jeanie, who wants to see this dance?

1154
01:17:33,909 --> 01:17:35,900
Me, Dave.

1155
01:17:36,989 --> 01:17:38,980
I do.

1156
01:18:01,869 --> 01:18:03,860
(Gaz) Women only, you tosser!

1157
01:18:03,949 --> 01:18:07,385
Women only!
It's on all t" posters, for fuck's sake.

1158
01:18:07,469 --> 01:18:09,061
No, nobody told me.

1159
01:18:09,149 --> 01:18:11,617
All the blokes from t" pub are in there.

1160
01:18:12,069 --> 01:18:15,823
- Bastards!
- You'll be all right once you're on stage.

1161
01:18:15,909 --> 01:18:17,900
Once I'm on stage?

1162
01:18:17,989 --> 01:18:23,222
I'm going nowhere near the fucking stage!
It's suicide! That's what it is! Suicide!

1163
01:18:25,389 --> 01:18:27,380
(audience chants)

1164
01:18:31,629 --> 01:18:34,302
(all)  Come on, come on! Come on, come on!

1165
01:18:34,389 --> 01:18:36,857
 Come on, come on! Come on!

1166
01:18:37,669 --> 01:18:39,580
Shit! I'll give the money back.

1167
01:18:39,669 --> 01:18:41,500
Alan, announce it, please.

1168
01:18:41,589 --> 01:18:44,149
To 4ú00 horny punters?
Ask me another one, kid!

1169
01:18:44,869 --> 01:18:46,427
(Alan) By "eck!

1170
01:18:46,509 --> 01:18:49,501
Our old dinner lady's ont" front row!

1171
01:18:49,589 --> 01:18:52,467
- We'll get torn to pieces!
- You will if you don't go on!

1172
01:18:52,549 --> 01:18:55,382
Ever seen a zebra brought down
by a pack of wolves?

1173
01:18:55,469 --> 01:18:59,781
- These nature films. Aren't they marvellous?
- Brilliant, aren't they?

1174
01:18:59,869 --> 01:19:02,747
- They are, aren't they, Gerald?
- Oh, pack it in!

1175
01:19:02,829 --> 01:19:05,866
- Not lost your bottle, have you, Gaz?
- (all) Dave!

1176
01:19:05,949 --> 01:19:08,747
There were not on telly
so I thought I'd give it a go.

1177
01:19:08,829 --> 01:19:12,424
- I found this wandering about outside.
- They wouldn't let me in.

1178
01:19:12,509 --> 01:19:15,387
What the hell are you doing "ere?
Your mum'll go mad!

1179
01:19:15,469 --> 01:19:17,460
- She's out front.
- Is she?

1180
01:19:17,549 --> 01:19:19,540
Is Barry with her?

1181
01:19:19,629 --> 01:19:22,302
She wouldn't let him come.
Said it were women only.

1182
01:19:22,389 --> 01:19:25,301
Right! I can't hold them any longer!
It's now or never!

1183
01:19:25,829 --> 01:19:27,820
(Dave) Here we go. We're bloody on.

1184
01:19:27,909 --> 01:19:30,139
Go get your jacket on.

1185
01:19:33,149 --> 01:19:35,583
Can't we leave us G-strings on, Gaz?

1186
01:19:35,669 --> 01:19:37,660
Perhaps you better had.

1187
01:19:37,749 --> 01:19:39,740
No, we better hadn't.

1188
01:19:39,829 --> 01:19:43,026
Listen.
If we're doing this, then just this once,...

1189
01:19:43,109 --> 01:19:45,100
..we're doing it right.

1190
01:19:45,189 --> 01:19:46,986
Now, come on.

1191
01:19:48,149 --> 01:19:50,868
(Alan) Come on, put your hands together...

1192
01:19:50,949 --> 01:19:53,144
..and welcome Mr Dave Horsefall!

1193
01:19:54,629 --> 01:19:56,620
(cheering)

1194
01:20:02,349 --> 01:20:05,659
OK, ladies and gents...
and you buggers up the back there!

1195
01:20:06,629 --> 01:20:07,948
Get on with it!

1196
01:20:08,029 --> 01:20:12,341
We may not be young, we may not be pretty,
we may not be right good,...

1197
01:20:12,429 --> 01:20:14,465
..but we're here.

1198
01:20:14,549 --> 01:20:16,824
We're live, and for one night only...

1199
01:20:16,909 --> 01:20:19,742
- ..we're going for the full monty!
