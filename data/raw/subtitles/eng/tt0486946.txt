00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:54,985
His cologne is fantastic.

171
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:57,852
It's musky with an oaky finish.

172
00:10:57,923 --> 00:11:01,450
Like a lawyer cowboy.

173
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:03,654
Lawyer cowboy?

174
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:07,030
Wild Hogs aren't welcome here.

175
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:08,532
- Hey, Paul.
- How you doing?

176
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:09,761
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Paul.

177
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:11,029
Hey, Woody.

178
00:11:11,103 --> 00:11:13,799
Just waiting on those K-ones
to do your tax returns.

179
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:17,206
We also need to talk about that
offshore incorporating thing.

180
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:18,937
Yeah, well,
I'll give you a call.

181
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:22,913
OK. I'll set up lunch.
Or we could do a day at the spa.

182
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:24,882
Now that was fun.

183
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:27,919
- Huh?
- I don't remember that.

184
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:31,684
- Got your wine cooler, Dad.
- Oh, sweet. Thanks.

185
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:34,191
- I'll see you Hogs in Hell!
- We'll make it.

186
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:37,024
- That was scary, Paul. Good work.
- See you later.

187
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:40,190
- I'm not coming here anymore.
- But this is a Wild Hog tradition.

188
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:42,734
We're not Wild Hogs,
we're like wild lambs.

189
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:44,963
It's just a patch
that Doug's wife made.

190
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:47,505
We sewed it on our jackets
so she wouldn't feel bad.

191
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:49,131
- Is that a fact?
- [Woody] Yeah.

192
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,073
Well, what has
your wife ever made us?

193
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:52,167
- Hard.
- [all laugh]

194
00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:54,337
- Hey.
- That's true, she is really.

195
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:57,974
- All I'm saying is she's good-looking.
- Show some respect.

196
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,985
Come on. That's what your wife does.
She's a swimsuit model.

197
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:03,317
And it... And a good one,
I mean. She is hot.

198
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:07,189
OK, here's a question:
What are we doing here?

199
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:09,591
Having... Having beers
like we do every week.

200
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:13,291
No, no, no. Bigger picture. Life, man.
What do we have to look forward to?

201
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:15,526
Riding in formation
in the Labor Day Parade?

202
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:17,967
- Is that it?
- I'm looking forward to the parade.

203
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:20,198
I got Tootsie Rolls
I can throw to the kids.

204
00:12:20,272 --> 00:12:21,864
- [groans]
- Tootsie Rolls

205
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:23,704
that he can throw to the kids.

206
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:27,576
Man, you can't even put on your
turn signal without busting your ass.

207
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:30,240
Look, let's put some
real miles on those bikes.

208
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:33,717
- Road trip?
- Yeah. A road trip.

209
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:37,984
Just us. No rules.
No Tootsie Rolls.

210
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:40,821
Just us, the wind,
the road to the Pacific.

211
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:42,952
We camp out for a week,
whenever we want,

212
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:44,859
wherever we want.

213
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,420
I mean, that's freedom, man.

214
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:48,558
As long as we stop
at some Wi-Fi hotspots,

215
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:50,864
- count me in. Yep.
- You're in? All right.

216
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:54,099
Eh, I can't. [stuttering]
I can't get the time off of work.

217
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:56,937
- You know, I'm a doctor.
- You're a dentist.

218
00:12:57,009 --> 00:13:00,410
Look, in college... Man,
he'd have been packed already.

219
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:03,448
I'm not kidding. You know,
and on a bike, he's fearless.

220
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:05,643
- He was fearless.
- Yeah, well, that was...

221
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:08,744
This guy, we called him
"The Golden Knight." Where's that guy?

222
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:11,756
- I wanna see that guy again.
- That guy's married now.

223
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:15,658
And that guy, uh, used to...
used to get high a lot.

224
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:18,128
- What's Claudia gonna say about this?
- Nothing.

225
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:22,258
She's in the Bahamas doing some
swimsuit thing for Sports Illustrated.

226
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:24,199
Look, if not now, when?

227
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:27,899
Y'all know me.
I'm the first to get buck wild.

228
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:30,441
- But...
- No, you're afraid to ask your wife.

229
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:34,104
True. True. I said true!

230
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,807
Come on!

231
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:38,975
This is it, on the edge, we're living!
You know, St. Elmo's Fire,

232
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:41,019
The Wild Bunch.
You know, Deliverance!

233
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:42,178
[all] Deliverance?

234
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:43,949
- Uh... You know...
- Deliverance?

235
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:45,854
[Bobby] Deliverance?

236
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:48,792
Hey, dudes. We're gonna
ride as an American flag

237
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:50,089
in the parade this year.

238
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:52,460
Each guy in our chapter
is a star.

239
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:54,192
- A what?
- I'm gonna get sick.

240
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:57,633
- Who's gonna do the stripes?
- [man] Lyman Middle School majorettes.

241
00:13:57,703 --> 00:14:00,035
Oh, boy. Hey, we're
really living now, huh?

242
00:14:00,105 --> 00:14:02,096
I hope we don't get
hit by a stray baton.

243
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:04,039
You know what?
I'm outta here.

244
00:14:04,109 --> 00:14:06,339
I'm going with you guys
or without you guys.

245
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:07,538
You know what I mean?

246
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:09,478
Take your smelly tees.
Good night.

247
00:14:09,548 --> 00:14:11,311
- I said I'd go.
- [Doug] Come on back.

248
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:14,113
Hmm. Oh, I almost forgot.

249
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:16,552
We're also gonna be wearing
these black ribbons

250
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:19,455
in honor of Tom Peterson.
He died last week...

251
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:23,586
Boom! Just like that.
Anyway, he'll be missed.

252
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:27,198
Tom Peterson. Tom Peterson.

253
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:29,257
Do you remember that guy?

254
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:31,360
He was our age.

255
00:14:41,947 --> 00:14:44,040
- Mom, want some gravy?
- Oh, yeah, thanks.

256
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:49,012
- So how was your ride?
- I don't know.

257
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:52,649
All Woody did was yap about taking
some stupid cross-country trip.

258
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,852
Do you wanna talk
about going on this ride?

259
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:56,622
I can't go on a cross-country trip.

260
00:14:56,695 --> 00:14:58,754
I can't walk away
from work anytime I want.

261
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:01,231
Yeah, you know what,
you're right.

262
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,767
It's just as well.

263
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:05,770
Road trips probably aren't
the best thing for a guy your age.

264
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:08,170
I mean, it's gotta be
really inconvenient.

265
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,936
Bunch of middle-aged guys
having to get off their bikes

266
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,671
every 20 minutes to take a pee...

267
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:15,908
My age? What kind of crack is that?
What's wrong with my age?

268
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:18,074
She talks like I'm not
right here, you know?

269
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,777
Doug, I'm joking.

270
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:22,980
No, you know what I think?
I think you think I'm a boring guy.

271
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:25,353
I'm old and I'm boring now.
I've become lame.

272
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:28,052
I think everybody thinks that
at this table. I'm lame!

273
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:30,391
- Admit it! I'm lame!
- Doug, calm down. It's OK.

274
00:15:30,462 --> 00:15:33,022
No, I'm not gonna calm down.
You know what I think?

275
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:36,090
"Calming down" means
another word for "lame!"

276
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:39,695
I'm not lame!
You know, I'm wild and free!

277
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,933
Wild and free and a man, yeah!

278
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:44,908
A man that likes to eat meat.
I'm tired of not eating meat!

279
00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:47,241
Meat's good!
Good for men.

280
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:51,044
And potatoes. I like
potatoes and I like gravy

281
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:54,677
on my potatoes. Yum, yum!

282
00:15:54,753 --> 00:15:58,780
[chuckling, gulping, gasping]

283
00:15:58,857 --> 00:16:01,655
- Don't make sudden moves.
- I'm living wild, living good.

284
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:04,093
- It feels good, baby!
- Whoa, no, Dad. Your LDL.

285
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:07,030
Butt out, LDLs! I miss butter.
You know why I miss butter?

286
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:10,262
The French think butter
is just like cheese, they eat it...

287
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:12,896
They eat it just like this.
Right off the stick.

288
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:16,840
And the French, who've never won
a major battle, they know how to eat!

289
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:18,843
- And I...
- [grumbling]

290
00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:21,573
I am living,
and it feels great!

291
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,638
[sighs]

292
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:26,814
Mmm...

293
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:29,677
Hmm. [groaning, belching]

294
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:33,247
- Doug, are you OK?
- [continues belching]

295
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:34,724
- [mumbling]
- Doug, you OK?

296
00:16:34,793 --> 00:16:37,694
- Yeah! I'm all right...
- [Billy] Dad, just spit it out!

297
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:38,991
Spit it out! Come on.

298
00:16:39,064 --> 00:16:40,998
- Breathe, breathe!
- I am not all right.

299
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:46,497
- Well, Mr. Madsen...
- Dr. Madsen...

300
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:49,973
Oh, really? Great. Then I can
put this a little more simply.

301
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:54,775
You had a catecholamine-induced,
super-ventricular tachyarrhythmia.

302
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:58,374
I'm actually a dentist, so I
have no idea what you just said.

303
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:01,078
- Stress-induced panic attack.
- I'm not stressed.

304
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:04,384
Your body says otherwise.
We see this a lot in middle-aged men.

305
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:07,516
- I'm not middle-aged.
- We hear that a lot, too.

306
00:17:07,593 --> 00:17:09,857
How 'bout we get you
out of here in a few minutes?

307
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:12,556
[woman] Dr. Wesley to imaging.
Dr. Wesley to imaging.

308
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:14,292
I am a middle-aged man,
aren't I?

309
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:17,893
- Only mathematically.
- [sighs]

310
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:20,530
I think you need to let off some steam.

311
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:22,767
You used to love to travel.

312
00:17:22,841 --> 00:17:25,275
No, Doug, you used to play hockey.
You were crazy.

313
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:27,574
You don't even
sing annoying eighties music.

314
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:29,011
Well, it's different now.

315
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:32,414
You know, I had to slow down
for... for you and Billy.

316
00:17:32,484 --> 00:17:34,384
Oh, so I'm the one
who did this to you?

317
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:35,511
I'm in a hospital.

318
00:17:35,587 --> 00:17:38,556
It's easier for me now to blame
other people for my problems.

319
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:42,890
W... I think you should
go on that trip.

320
00:17:42,961 --> 00:17:46,021
If you don't, I will fire up
the hog and go with the guys.

321
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:48,931
- Woody doesn't have a plan.
- Yeah, but he never does.

322
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:50,901
It's like taking a trip to nowhere.

323
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:54,501
Maybe that's exactly what you need.

324
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:02,442
What up?

325
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:06,644
Hey. You're late! Supposed to
be here at eight-thirty, guys.

326
00:18:06,718 --> 00:18:09,687
Hey, look here,
if Karen calls,

327
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:14,215
OK, I'm at a toilet
bowl seminar in Cleveland.

328
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:16,693
- [all laugh]
- Hey, no, I'm serious.

329
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,252
I need y'all to cover for me.

330
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:20,423
Yeah, sure.

331
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:24,300
What? What?
What are you looking at?

332
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:25,495
I got a tat.

333
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:27,334
- Come on!
- Hell just froze over.

334
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:29,738
- Let's see it!
- I'm a biker, dude!

335
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:31,435
I got a tat!

336
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:34,479
- [Woody] It's an apple.
- Uh, Dudley, you know...

337
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:37,879
I know: Trademarked.
But what are they gonna say?

338
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,851
It's in my skin, bitch!
[laughs]

[cackling]

340
00:18:42,988 --> 00:18:46,219
- You guys aren't gonna wear helmets?
- I don't wanna wear a helmet.

341
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,782
Maybe I don't want anything
between me and the road.

342
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:50,488
You will if your head falls on it.

343
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:53,793
Woody, 62 percent of motorcycle
fatalities can be prevented with

344
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:56,198
- the use of an approved DOT helmet.
- That right?

345
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:59,533
What's that leather condom
gonna protect you from? Snoopy?

346
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:01,402
The Red Baron? How about dating?

347
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:03,373
- You told me you liked it.
- Guys, hey!

348
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:07,276
There are no rules on this trip.
We're just heading for the Pacific,

349
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:10,747
- and there ain't no plans.
- Well, we got a week to do this, right?

350
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,909
I figure we gotta be
in Illinois by tonight.

351
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,545
Well, the way I mapped it out,
we should be 1 00 miles

352
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:17,816
- past St. Louis by sundown.
- [Doug] Good.

353
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:20,415
What did I say?
I said it's the open road, OK?

354
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:23,620
- Who knows where we're gonna be?
- I know where we're gonna be.

355
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:26,186
Dudley hooked me up.
Check out this thing.

356
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:27,994
It's a GPS in my phone now.

357
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:29,931
- Look at that.
- No kidding? Let me see.

358
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,333
- Cool!
- What are you...

359
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:34,934
- Hey, what'd you do that for?!
- For the good of the trip.

360
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,908
You don't need a GPS
to discover America.

361
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:40,001
You need a bike and
you need the road, OK?

362
00:19:40,078 --> 00:19:42,842
Freedom. And if we have an
emergency, I got a cell phone.

363
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:44,143
- No you don't.
- What?

364
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:47,617
Hey! Why did you do that?
I got all my data in there!

365
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,881
Well, how does that feel, Woody?

366
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:53,724
Feels good. Whoo!

367
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:56,283
~ It's my prerogative!
Mm-mm-mm! ~

368
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:58,022
- No cell phones!
- Wait a minute.

369
00:19:58,096 --> 00:20:00,360
- Come on, get rid of it.
- No, Doug, he's right.

370
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:02,730
- No, no, wait, wait...
- Whoo!

371
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:05,861
Yeah! Yeah, Wild Hogs, baby!
Wild Hogs!

372
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:07,906
You did that so
Karen wouldn't call you.

373
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:09,497
- Exactly.
- Come on, give it up.

374
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:13,375
So we're not gonna discuss this? We're
not gonna think about this? No, don't!

375
00:20:13,445 --> 00:20:15,208
- We need one phone.
- Freedom, baby!

376
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:21,246
- [tires squealing]
- We gotta go.

377
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,848
- [Doug] Go, go!
- [man] Come back here!

378
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:28,894

00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,862
[~ Grand Funk Railroad: Walk Like A Man
(You Can Call Me Your Man)]

380
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:54,250
- Hey!
- Whoo!

381
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:55,718
Where're you guys headed?

382
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,582
I love you!

383
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:03,552
You're hot!

384
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:15,029
[thundering]

385
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:25,909
- Losers.
- Look at these guys.

386
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:29,250
Hey.

387
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:32,848
- [girls laughing]
- You guys wanna a ride?

388
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:39,057
Well, all right.
Sleeping bags are all set.

389
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:45,262
Bobby, I got two words
for you: Foot pump.

390
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:49,068
Woody, I got four words for you:
Got a cheap-ass wife.

391
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:50,335
[all chuckle]

392
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:54,175
Hey, guys, this is poop.
So don't eat it.

393
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:56,407
- Oh, God.
- Excuse me, Mr. Hard Drive,

394
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:58,813
you're supposed to bury it,
not put it in a bag.

395
00:21:58,884 --> 00:22:01,444
This is plastic,
I'm not gonna put it in the earth.

396
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,317
I'll find a garbage can tomorrow.

397
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:08,957
So you gonna sit right next to me
with that doo-doo.

398
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:13,558
Hey, come on.
Doesn't get any better than this.

399
00:22:13,632 --> 00:22:17,534
Sitting around a fire, chilling with
your best friends, relaxing, enjoying...

400
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:19,866
Sorry, you gotta...
You gotta bury that thing.

401
00:22:19,938 --> 00:22:22,964
- Otherwise I'll vomit in your lap.
- ...each other's company.

402
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:25,635
I'll hang it from a tree
so the bears don't get it.

403
00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:28,339
- No, don't hang it in a tree!
- Why not?

404
00:22:28,413 --> 00:22:32,349
- 'Cause bears don't eat shit!
- [laughing]

405
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:38,819
What's up?

406
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,050
Ever wake up and wonder
what happened to your life?

407
00:22:44,329 --> 00:22:45,956
I really had such great plans.

408
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:49,899
My life and my work
would be an adventure. You know?

409
00:22:49,968 --> 00:22:51,868
All of a sudden
I'm a suburban dentist.

410
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:53,837
Hey, look, Doug,
I feel your pain, man.

411
00:22:53,905 --> 00:22:56,806
Look, I swore I would
never return to a job

412
00:22:56,875 --> 00:23:00,038
where I had to wear
condoms on my shoes.

413
00:23:00,112 --> 00:23:01,739
- You're still at The Firm?
- Yeah.

414
00:23:01,813 --> 00:23:05,340
And I get yelled at
by an ungrateful wife all night.

415
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:08,386
- The whole thing has made me...
- A wimp.

416
00:23:08,453 --> 00:23:11,980
I was gonna say miserable.
But you think I'm a wimp?

417
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:14,924
No, I thought you were gonna say wimp,
so I just filled it in.

418
00:23:14,993 --> 00:23:17,723
You're a wimp, Bobby.
I... I'll say it.

419
00:23:17,796 --> 00:23:21,061
I mean, you're afraid of women.
It's kind of embarrassing.

420
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:23,761
- I'm afraid of women.
- You're afraid to talk to women.

421
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:25,393
Bobby's afraid they'll kill him

422
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:27,734
- in his sleep.
- [all laugh]

423
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:31,037
Wow. Now I'm really
afraid of women.

424
00:23:31,109 --> 00:23:33,236
At least one of us
is living the fairy tale.

425
00:23:33,311 --> 00:23:35,836
Right, Woody? Plenty of money,
travel all the time,

426
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:37,745
you got the swimsuit model
for a wife.

427
00:23:37,816 --> 00:23:39,807
At least one of us
has got it made.

428
00:23:39,885 --> 00:23:43,048
Yeah, Well, one man's fairy tale
is another man's nightmare.

429
00:23:44,656 --> 00:23:47,056
You think that the
marshmallow's done, Doug?

430
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:51,357
Oh. Hey, look at that. Anybody
want the first marshmallow?

431
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:54,263
Starting to look like
Dudley's helmet.

432
00:23:56,334 --> 00:23:57,323
All right.

433
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:01,905
- I think I'm halfway there.
- Oh, in only one hour?

434
00:24:01,973 --> 00:24:03,838
Hey, Bobby, you sure
you wanna do that?

435
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:06,878
You could use one of the spare
bags we got in the... tent!

436
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:09,379
Hey, Dudley, go get
the water jug out of my bag!

437
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:11,382
I want... Kick, kick,
kick, kick! Dirt!

438
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,542
I got it!

439
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:14,744
That's camp-stove fuel!

440
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,947
[all exclaiming]

441
00:24:17,022 --> 00:24:18,182
No!

442
00:24:19,324 --> 00:24:20,621
This is the wrong jug!

443
00:24:20,692 --> 00:24:22,023
You think?

444
00:24:22,994 --> 00:24:24,052
Aw, God.

445
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:26,154
This is supposed to be flame-retardant.

446
00:24:26,231 --> 00:24:28,222
I guess it wasn't
"Dudley-retardant."

447
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:33,069
All my drawers are burning.

448
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,632
Oh, perfect!

449
00:24:39,444 --> 00:24:42,413
[snoring]

450
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:51,679
[muttering]

451
00:24:51,756 --> 00:24:52,950
What are you doing?

452
00:24:53,024 --> 00:24:55,254
Huh? Keeping my face
out of the wind.

453
00:24:56,628 --> 00:25:01,292
[groans] Hey. Oh.
Boy, my ass is sore.

454
00:25:01,366 --> 00:25:02,890
[Dudley] Mine, too.

455
00:25:02,968 --> 00:25:06,062
It's Woody's fault
for riding us so hard yesterday.

456
00:25:06,137 --> 00:25:10,130
The human body wasn't made to straddle
something that big for that long.

457
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:14,372
Well, you know, it's gonna hurt a little
bit, and that's part of the experience.

458
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:16,346
That's why we didn't bring our wives.

459
00:25:16,414 --> 00:25:18,814
[Bobby] What the...
What the hell?

460
00:25:18,884 --> 00:25:22,479
Somebody wanna explain to me
why I'm the one in the dirt...

461
00:25:22,554 --> 00:25:25,352
...when I got sore jaws
from three hours of blowing...

462
00:25:27,425 --> 00:25:32,362
Please, please for the love
of God, finish your sentence.

463
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:37,997
Let's see, what, uh...

464
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:39,661
What exactly
do we have here?

465
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:41,069
We've got...

466
00:25:41,139 --> 00:25:45,974
...one, two, three men...
in a bed... spooning?

467
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:47,636
This is not what it looks like.

468
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:50,647
This is a, uh... We, um...
What is it, Woody?

469
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:51,704
Camping.

470
00:25:51,783 --> 00:25:54,946
I'll tell you just exactly
what it is there, Poindexter.

471
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,887
It is four counts
of indecent exposure,

472
00:25:57,956 --> 00:26:01,119
two counts of lewd,
lascivious behavior, and...

473
00:26:02,027 --> 00:26:05,656
...one count...
of pure jealousy.

474
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:09,188
- Huh?
- How you doing?

475
00:26:09,267 --> 00:26:10,825
- Hey, look.
- Whoa, we're not...

476
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:12,767
Thanks for waking us up,
Officer.

477
00:26:12,837 --> 00:26:16,329
- Oh, it was actually...
- I get it. You gotta get going.

478
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:17,534
That's terrific.

479
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:19,873
Five's a crowd? Is that
what I'm gleaning here?

480
00:26:19,945 --> 00:26:23,346
Yeah, five's... uneven number.
Figure it out.

481
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,883
You guys can't see it, can you?
You're too close.

482
00:26:25,951 --> 00:26:29,443
You don't realize how lucky
you are to have each other.

483
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:33,548
Oh, daddy... Damn lucky.

484
00:26:35,393 --> 00:26:38,260
- I've always felt so.
- I know what you've felt.

485
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:40,628
I have too.

486
00:26:53,044 --> 00:26:56,036
- You wearing pants?
- No.

487
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:58,810
Would you please put some
pants on, for God's sake!

488
00:26:58,883 --> 00:27:00,510
[Doug] Dudley!

489
00:27:00,585 --> 00:27:01,950
What a nice guy.

490
00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:06,819
Mmm.
Oh, yeah.

491
00:27:07,826 --> 00:27:09,817
Whoo! Anybody else
gotta take a leak?

492
00:27:09,894 --> 00:27:11,088
- No.
- No.

493
00:27:11,162 --> 00:27:13,323
Hey, guys, last
stop for quite a while.

494
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:16,799
I gotta pee again now.

496
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:08,246
Wow. I can
smell them from here.

497
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:11,948
Gentlemen,
that's the real deal.

Ahh.

501
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:47,048
What?

502
00:28:48,259 --> 00:28:51,956
- [both laughing]
- [Bobby] Now, that's "wild!"

This is awesome!

00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:47,043
Thanks for
waiting for me, jerks!

510
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,712
Yoo-hoo!

511
00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:53,617
Oh, it's...
Whoa, it's cold!

512
00:29:54,926 --> 00:29:57,554
- What?
- Why are you naked?

513
00:29:57,629 --> 00:30:00,257
We're swimming. Did you guys
keep your skivvies on?

514
00:30:00,331 --> 00:30:02,629
There could be snapping
turtles or something.

515
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:05,635
I kept mine on 'cause I didn't
want it to get dark in here.

516
00:30:05,703 --> 00:30:08,797
I don't know, I thought we were
doing this wild and free thing.

517
00:30:08,873 --> 00:30:10,033
Yeah, well...

518
00:30:11,876 --> 00:30:14,344
More like, old and lame,
isn't it?

519
00:30:14,412 --> 00:30:17,210

ripped 'em right off, you know,

back in the... back in the day.

521

- This isn't necessary.

522
00:30:22,854 --> 00:30:26,551
[chuckles] Yeah, come on.
Come on! Huh?

523
00:30:28,092 --> 00:30:31,255
Now you see what you started?
You even got Doug out of his drawers.

524
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:33,320
What the hell,
you know what I mean?

525
00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:35,195
But everybody
keep their distance.

Whew. You guys are nuts.

Come on! Huh?

530
00:30:50,882 --> 00:30:55,512
[laughs] Fine. I will
get naked with my gay friends,

531
00:30:55,587 --> 00:30:58,886
and if any of them look at
my junk, I will kill them.

532

the good old days.

There's a much shallower creek
for kids just up the canyon a bit.

Oh, no, my kids like to dive.

Marky, show this guy your dive.

545
00:31:31,656 --> 00:31:34,819
If you put your arms out, he
does a backflip right into them.

546
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:36,861
No! Don't do that,
it's not a good idea.

Oh, hello.

eat that way over there.

Uh, less ants and snakes.

No... Oh, whoa. Guys,
you can't swim here.

they're snapping... Ow!

looking for crawfish!

- He's gonna find a couple!

Oh, my God.

- I didn't wanna do this.
- Out of the water! Now!

Run! Run! Run! Go!

with these people? Come on, go!

was really good.

- Maybe we should go.
- Yeah, let's go.

over there and I...

Shut up.

00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,819
All right.

You're looking for trouble?

635
00:37:16,701 --> 00:37:18,692
You gotta be careful
about Bobby here.

His temper's like
a Roman candle.

Woody over here,

- What?
- Yeah. You make kids cry.

642
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:36,018
You made my child cry.

643
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:38,021
Your kid was crying
before she got to me.

644
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:40,489
Yeah. But I asked you
to give her a lollipop. Be...

645
00:37:40,558 --> 00:37:42,788
- It calms her down.
- You can't give a lolli...

646
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:45,328
- All right, shut up!
- You know what?

647
00:37:45,396 --> 00:37:47,261
I think we better get out of here.

648
00:37:47,331 --> 00:37:49,959
No. We'll get
out of here at sundown.

649
00:37:50,034 --> 00:37:51,865
After we've had our beverage.

650
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:54,461
Sundown, Hoss? What?

651
00:37:54,538 --> 00:37:59,771
These are on me. You got
the mocha lattes yesterday.

'48 Panhead outside?

Uh, that's my '48.

And I'm sick of it.
How 'bout a trade there, brother?

- Dudley. Dudley, Dudley.
- Oh. I wish.

00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:07,479
- I'm killing him.
- You're gonna kill him?

830
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:10,042
We're all thinking it.
Gonna need the nourishment.

831
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:11,678
He'll put up the least struggle.

832
00:48:11,755 --> 00:48:13,985
- Move out of the way.
- You love Dudley.

833
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:16,252
It's the sun.
It's making us all crazy.

834
00:48:16,326 --> 00:48:19,762
You're right, man.
My... my bad, Dud.

835
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:21,855
You know, I don't know
what came over me.

836
00:48:21,932 --> 00:48:25,424
Dehydration. Your blood's thickening,
so your heart's working harder

837
00:48:25,502 --> 00:48:28,232
to pump it through your arteries.
Less gets to your head.

838
00:48:28,305 --> 00:48:30,933
Our bodies are literally
trying to drink themselves.

839
00:48:31,008 --> 00:48:32,703
All right. I'm killing him.

840
00:48:32,776 --> 00:48:35,006
[Doug] Wait a minute.
They got a sign up here.

841
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:36,909
Curve of the road.
Read it!

842
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:39,972
- Madrid? Spain?
- No. It's Madrid.

843
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:42,075
That's what the locals say.
I Googled it.

844
00:48:42,152 --> 00:48:44,848
Gonna be water, food and gas.

845
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:48,790
- We're gonna live.
- We gonna live!

846
00:48:48,859 --> 00:48:51,350
We gonna live, baby!

847
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:53,828
[country music plays]

848
00:48:55,465 --> 00:48:57,092
[Doug] It's closed!

849
00:48:57,167 --> 00:48:59,533
Ah, man! It's closed!

850
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:02,128
But the diner up here...

851
00:49:02,205 --> 00:49:04,799
The diner's open!
Come on!

852
00:49:04,875 --> 00:49:07,867
- [all panting]
- Get me a drink, quick!

853
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:09,606
- We need water!
- Quick!

854
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:12,080
- Hey! Come on!
- Right here. Right here!

855
00:49:12,149 --> 00:49:13,138
Whoa!

856
00:49:13,216 --> 00:49:16,652
- Oh! Right here! Me!
- Me! Me!

857
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,312
- You?
- Me!

858
00:49:18,388 --> 00:49:20,652
[growling]

859
00:49:21,825 --> 00:49:24,885
- Hey!
- You!

860
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:28,159
They were here three weeks ago.
They're already getting violent.

861
00:49:28,231 --> 00:49:30,665
It's OK, I got it.

862
00:49:31,735 --> 00:49:32,724
[belching]

863
00:49:35,105 --> 00:49:37,665
- You gentlemen like a seat?
- Is there a booth open?

864
00:49:37,741 --> 00:49:39,538
- Let's go!
- [dishes clattering]

865
00:49:39,609 --> 00:49:41,008
- Yeah. Uh, what?
- Come on.

866
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:45,243
- Keep moving!
- Uh, nice town.

867
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:53,817
So, uh, I...

868
00:49:54,624 --> 00:49:56,182
Uh...

869
00:50:03,266 --> 00:50:06,633
- She is perfect.
- You like the waitress?

870
00:50:06,703 --> 00:50:09,763
Oh, man. I wanted to say
something funny to her,

871
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,774
but all I could think
of was black jokes.

872
00:50:12,909 --> 00:50:15,810
- Like which ones?
- I forget.

873
00:50:15,879 --> 00:50:19,508
Why don't you tell the one that ends
with you getting your ass whupped?

874
00:50:19,583 --> 00:50:22,381
- Would that be funny?
- I'll be laughing.

875
00:50:22,452 --> 00:50:25,148
Oh, I'll be cracking up.
[laughs]

876
00:50:25,222 --> 00:50:29,124
- [bell chimes]
- [Doug] Oh, it's the law. Oh, boy.

877
00:50:34,798 --> 00:50:37,961
- You boys here for the Chile Festival?
- What, you have a problem?

878
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:41,368
You look like you saw something
explode or something, all right.

879
00:50:41,438 --> 00:50:42,871
We're just passing through.

880
00:50:42,939 --> 00:50:46,534
The people around here
don't want any more trouble.

881
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:49,135
Now me, I got no problem
with you Del Fuegos

882
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:51,544
as long as you boys
could stay sober...

883
00:50:51,615 --> 00:50:54,709
No, no. No, we're... we're not
associated with those assholes.

884
00:50:54,785 --> 00:50:56,377
- You're not?
- [Doug] No.

885
00:50:56,453 --> 00:50:57,977
- For real?
- Yeah.

886
00:50:58,055 --> 00:51:01,456
[exhales deeply]
Folks, they're not Del Fuegos.

887
00:51:01,525 --> 00:51:03,493
[all sigh, murmuring]

888
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:05,892
Are the Del Fuegos
a problem around here?

889
00:51:05,962 --> 00:51:08,624
Only if you expect 'em
to pay for a meal they just ate

890
00:51:08,698 --> 00:51:10,165
or a beer they just drank.

891
00:51:10,233 --> 00:51:12,098
- Won't have problems with us.
- No, no.

892
00:51:12,169 --> 00:51:15,366
- Then welcome to Madrid.
- Excuse me, sheriff?

893
00:51:15,439 --> 00:51:17,566
- Uh, the Del Fuegos?
- Yeah.

894
00:51:17,641 --> 00:51:21,077
OK, now. How often might
they come through this town?

895
00:51:21,144 --> 00:51:23,169
Oh, once every few months.

896
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:24,713
- Oh?
- Yeah. Yeah.

897
00:51:24,781 --> 00:51:27,272
And... the gas station,
now when would that be open?

898
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:29,682
That's closed on Sundays.
So tomorrow morning.

899
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:31,152
Oh, God.

900
00:51:31,221 --> 00:51:34,713
But maybe you should seriously
consider spending the night.

901
00:51:34,791 --> 00:51:38,192
Because we're having
the world's hottest chili contest.

902
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:41,094
The Chile Festival is not
something you wanna miss.

903
00:51:41,164 --> 00:51:43,962
Last year, somebody's throat
actually started to bleed.

904
00:51:44,034 --> 00:51:47,526
Oh, damn!
Somebody's throat started to bleed?

905
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:49,401
Yeah. Changed their life.

906
00:51:49,473 --> 00:51:51,805
It's great. Think about it.

907
00:51:53,243 --> 00:51:56,906
We gotta get out of this town, man.
This town is a drag. We gotta move on.

908
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:59,312
- We gotta find a way out.
- Woody, chill out, man.

909
00:51:59,382 --> 00:52:01,407
We finally get a chance to relax.

910
00:52:01,485 --> 00:52:03,385
Yeah. And being able
to use a bathroom,

911
00:52:03,453 --> 00:52:06,081
- that might be a good idea.
- And I can empty my poop bag.

912
00:52:06,156 --> 00:52:08,124
And you gonna re-use the bag?

913
00:52:08,191 --> 00:52:10,125
Woody, remember
the theme of this trip?

914
00:52:10,193 --> 00:52:11,990
"Whatever," remember?
"Whatever."

915
00:52:12,062 --> 00:52:13,359
OK, fine! Fine.

916
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:16,228
We'll stay the night,
and we'll get gas in the morning. OK?

917
00:52:16,299 --> 00:52:18,767
Calm down.
I don't understand what your rush is.

918
00:52:18,835 --> 00:52:21,565
I'm not in a rush, man.
I just wanna ride, man.

919
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:23,196
I just wanna ride. You know?

920
00:52:23,273 --> 00:52:25,537
~ Ride, Sally, ride ~

921
00:52:25,609 --> 00:52:29,170
You are so weird. He asks the...
You say the weirdest things, man.

922
00:52:29,246 --> 00:52:32,613
You're like, "We're digging roots,
buying real estate and shit."

923
00:52:32,682 --> 00:52:35,378
Yeah. Why don't you just... [sobbing]

924
00:52:35,452 --> 00:52:38,012
What?! What?

925
00:52:46,062 --> 00:52:47,654
All right, everybody come here.

926
00:52:47,731 --> 00:52:49,631
Come on.

927
00:52:51,968 --> 00:52:54,300
All right.

928
00:52:54,371 --> 00:52:55,861
We're here. Right?

929
00:52:55,939 --> 00:52:59,067
They could be in any of these towns.
Right around here. All right?

930
00:52:59,142 --> 00:53:01,337
We're gonna find them,
we're gonna get 'em.

931
00:53:01,411 --> 00:53:02,673
I don't know, Jack.

932
00:53:02,746 --> 00:53:05,613
I mean, by my calculations...
[stuttering] I'm thinking,

933
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:07,775
if they're four hours
ahead of us, we can...

934
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:11,184
Shut up! Anybody else wanna
tell me how hard this is gonna be?

935
00:53:11,254 --> 00:53:13,779
Huh? Any other naysayers?

936
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:17,554
Good. I want you to
break up into two-man teams.

937
00:53:17,627 --> 00:53:19,686
You call me when you find 'em.

938
00:53:19,763 --> 00:53:19,863
- [indistinct chatter]
- [~ Pony]

939
00:53:19,863 --> 00:53:25,426

941
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:54,023
Oh, snap.
A softball pitch.

942
00:53:54,097 --> 00:53:56,395
You... I gotta win
something for my girls.

943
00:53:56,466 --> 00:53:58,627
Wait a minute.
You think you're good at this?

944
00:53:58,702 --> 00:53:59,999
Oh, I know I'm good at this.

945
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:03,437
Hey, on my Little League team,
they used to call me "Bull's Eye Bobby."

946
00:54:03,506 --> 00:54:05,440
- Yeah.
- 'Cause I had pinpoint control.

947
00:54:05,508 --> 00:54:06,497
Right.

948
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:09,204
A hundred forty-four innings,
never walked a batter.

949
00:54:09,279 --> 00:54:10,769
Watch me work, baby.

950
00:54:10,847 --> 00:54:12,246
- Here you go.
- How you doin'?

951
00:54:12,315 --> 00:54:13,543
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

952
00:54:13,617 --> 00:54:15,847
All right, Bull's Eye Bobby, folks!

953
00:54:17,654 --> 00:54:19,986
Bull's Eye Bobby, baby.

954
00:54:20,957 --> 00:54:23,858
It's probably been, what?
Twenty-eight years, Bulls Eye?

955
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:26,225
[up-tempo music plays]

956
00:54:30,567 --> 00:54:33,058
- Hey.
- Hi.

957
00:54:34,070 --> 00:54:36,061
So, um...

958
00:54:37,507 --> 00:54:39,634
- Excuse me?
- [clears throat] Never mind.

959
00:54:39,709 --> 00:54:42,940
- So you like chili?
- Oh, yeah. Not the hot stuff.

960
00:54:43,013 --> 00:54:45,481
But you put a nice,
mild turkey chili in front of me?

961
00:54:45,548 --> 00:54:46,947
Oh, yeah, I'm gonna eat it.

962
00:54:47,017 --> 00:54:49,747
That's too bad 'cause
I wanted you to try mine, but...

963
00:54:49,819 --> 00:54:51,878
- ...it's pretty hot.
- No, I'll try it!

964
00:54:51,955 --> 00:54:55,789
I like your kinda hot. The...
In your chili. The chili hot. Food hot.

965
00:54:55,859 --> 00:54:58,657
That's the kinda hot
I wanna kiss. Eat.

966
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:01,995
OK. If you're sure
you can handle it.

967
00:55:02,065 --> 00:55:04,761
Handle it? I'm a biker.
[chuckles]

968
00:55:04,834 --> 00:55:06,825
- What'd you call him?
- Bull's Eye Bobby!

969
00:55:06,903 --> 00:55:08,302
Bull's Eye Bobby, baby.

970
00:55:08,371 --> 00:55:11,169
- Yeah, Bull's Eye. Yep.
- Ha-ha-ha!

971
00:55:12,642 --> 00:55:15,008
- [muffled groan]
- Oh...

972
00:55:17,113 --> 00:55:21,743
- I guess that counts as a walk?
- I'm gonna sit. [whimpers]

973
00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:24,810
[~ Don't Cha]

[singing]

975
00:55:38,702 --> 00:55:40,135
Mmm.

976
00:55:40,203 --> 00:55:42,694
Smooth. Tasty.

977
00:55:42,772 --> 00:55:45,297
Little... [coughs] ...spice.

978
00:55:45,375 --> 00:55:47,843
It gets a little hotter
as it sits in your throat.

979
00:55:48,778 --> 00:55:51,042
- [groans]
- You OK?

980
00:55:51,114 --> 00:55:52,342
Mm.

981
00:55:52,415 --> 00:55:54,713
You want some of this?
lt'll cool you down.

[garbling, muttering]

983
00:55:59,389 --> 00:56:01,721
Don't worry, your throat
won't actually bleed.

984
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:05,283
- [continues garbling]
- I understand.

985
00:56:09,265 --> 00:56:12,792
[Dudley] Mother of God!
I swallowed hot lava!

986
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:14,860
[continues singing]

987
00:56:20,443 --> 00:56:22,240
Hundred and forty-four innings,

988
00:56:22,312 --> 00:56:24,177
you never hit anybody
in the crotch?

989
00:56:24,247 --> 00:56:26,579
Not on purpose, man, all right?
You all right?

990
00:56:26,649 --> 00:56:30,016
- Yeah, it's... Good fastball.
- Hey. I'd like you boys

991
00:56:30,086 --> 00:56:32,350
to meet my deputies,
Earl and Buck Dooble.

992
00:56:32,422 --> 00:56:34,413
- How are you, Earl?
- I'm Earl. He's Buck.

993
00:56:34,491 --> 00:56:36,891
- [Doug] Earl, Buck.
- Now, just remember:

994
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:40,259
Brother with the word "ear" in his name
has got both on his head.

995
00:56:42,165 --> 00:56:44,929
See, I can only say that
'cause I'm on his right side,

996
00:56:45,001 --> 00:56:47,333
which, as you can see,
is mostly blown off.

997
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:49,565
- You say something?
- [shouting] I did not.

998
00:56:49,639 --> 00:56:52,938
Needless to say,
we don't carry firearms anymore.

999
00:56:53,009 --> 00:56:55,136
I mean, sometimes
you pull 'em out,

1000
00:56:55,211 --> 00:56:57,771
you think they're not loaded,
and then sometimes...

1001
00:56:57,847 --> 00:56:59,610
They blow your
deputy's ear off?

1002
00:56:59,682 --> 00:57:01,616
Yeah.

1003
00:57:04,053 --> 00:57:06,112
What brings you boys
on this trip, anyway?

1004
00:57:06,189 --> 00:57:09,158
Firstly, we had to get away, OK?

1005
00:57:09,225 --> 00:57:11,659
And secondly, you know,
you just never know

1006
00:57:11,728 --> 00:57:14,253
how many more summers
you've got left.

1007
00:57:14,330 --> 00:57:17,788
- Do you?
- Wow. That's deep.

1008
00:57:17,867 --> 00:57:19,732
I just came on this trip,

1009
00:57:19,803 --> 00:57:22,567
you know, hoping to reclaim
the old Doug, you know?

1010
00:57:22,639 --> 00:57:26,097
You know, I know
exactly what you mean.

1011
00:57:26,176 --> 00:57:30,169
You know, you can never let life
get too stagnant or too safe.

1012
00:57:30,246 --> 00:57:31,838
Every now and then you gotta do

1013
00:57:31,915 --> 00:57:35,043
what we folks around here
like to call "Slap the Bull."

1014
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:36,312
"Slapping the Bull"?

1015
00:57:36,386 --> 00:57:38,946
That's just a little game we play

1016
00:57:39,022 --> 00:57:41,923
to make sure your life
is not controlled by fear.

1017
00:57:41,991 --> 00:57:43,686
Yeah, I wanna do that.

1018
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:45,853
Oh, come on, guys.
We're exhausted.

1019
00:57:45,929 --> 00:57:48,625
I think we should just put
the bikes in back of the hotel,

1020
00:57:48,698 --> 00:57:52,395
in a shed with the doors closed,
perhaps, and then play Scrabble

1021
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:54,733
in the... in the room
with the shades down.

1022
00:57:54,804 --> 00:57:58,171
Look, Aunt Bee, maybe you wanna do
something else here in Mayberry.

1023
00:57:58,241 --> 00:57:59,230
Yeah.

1024
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:02,904
- How 'bout a little Bull Slap?
- Sounds like something I could win at.

1025
00:58:02,979 --> 00:58:04,913
- Yeah.
- I'll take a little Bull Slap.

1026
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:07,415
Look, Bull Slap for everybody.
Line 'em up.

1027
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:09,884
- Let's have a little Bull Slap.
- We'll do it!

1028
00:58:11,087 --> 00:58:13,317
So literally, we're gonna slap a bull?

1029
00:58:13,389 --> 00:58:17,655
Yep. Right on the ass. And then you're
gonna wanna hightail it outta there.

1030
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:19,285
- Why?
- 'Cause he can kill you.

1031
00:58:19,362 --> 00:58:20,852
- Mm-hmm.
- Perfect.

1032
00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:23,262
Hey, man, I thought
this was a drinking game.

1033
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:25,961
Yeah, you know, you got
a lot of animals I would slap.

1034
00:58:26,035 --> 00:58:28,833
A chicken, I'd slap a chicken.
Or a goat, maybe.

1035
00:58:28,905 --> 00:58:30,600
A ferret, I'd slap, you know?

1036
00:58:30,673 --> 00:58:32,800
But I'm not...
I'm not gonna slap a bull.

1037
00:58:32,876 --> 00:58:35,709
Oh, come on, Doug.
It was your idea. Get in there!

1038
00:58:35,778 --> 00:58:38,178
I didn't know we...
Look at the nuts on that thing!

1039
00:58:38,248 --> 00:58:39,237
[Woody] Come on!

1040
00:58:39,315 --> 00:58:41,476
- [Doug] It's not safe.
- Not safe. Know what?

1041
00:58:41,551 --> 00:58:44,486
- You snooze, you lose. I'm going.
- Getting ready to do that?

1042
00:58:44,554 --> 00:58:46,146
- Yep!
- Oh!

1043
00:58:46,222 --> 00:58:49,214
You jackass. Go ahead, Woody.
Hope you're wearing a cup.

1044
00:58:50,894 --> 00:58:53,488
- Right on the ass.
- He looks confident.

1045
00:58:53,563 --> 00:58:54,894
Easy.

1046
00:59:04,274 --> 00:59:05,639
Whoa!

1047
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:08,836
- Come on, get back, now!
- [all cheering]

1048
00:59:10,947 --> 00:59:12,346
Way to get back!

1049
00:59:12,415 --> 00:59:15,009
I just slapped
a big fat bull on the ass!

1050
00:59:15,084 --> 00:59:17,348
That was awesome! Who's next?

1051
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:19,650
- Uh, Doug?
- Doug?

1052
00:59:19,722 --> 00:59:21,713
Yeah, no,
that'd be you, yeah.

1053
00:59:21,791 --> 00:59:23,088
Come on, Doug. Do it!

1054
00:59:23,159 --> 00:59:24,751
It's... it... you could...

1055
00:59:24,827 --> 00:59:26,317
That's really an, um...

1056
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:28,421
Doug, go.

1057
00:59:28,498 --> 00:59:30,591
- Come on, man!
- Handle your business.

1058
00:59:30,667 --> 00:59:32,658
- [Woody] It was easy.
- I'm not gonna...

1059
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:34,566
[Woody] Yeah, come on! It's fun!

1060
00:59:35,471 --> 00:59:37,462
Old days, Doug. Old days.

1061
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:39,735
All right, all right,
I'm gonna slap a bull.

1062
00:59:39,809 --> 00:59:41,800
- I'm gonna slap that bull.
- There you go.

1063
00:59:41,878 --> 00:59:43,937
- [Woody] That's my Doug!
- There he goes.

1064
00:59:44,981 --> 00:59:46,915
Just slap it right there
on the rear end?

1065
00:59:46,983 --> 00:59:49,645
Right on the hind haunches.

1066
00:59:51,854 --> 00:59:54,084
You know, this is so good for Doug.

1067
00:59:54,157 --> 00:59:56,182
- Actually, it's good for all of us.
- Yeah.

1068
00:59:56,259 --> 00:59:58,124
Hey, thanks for bringing us here.

1069
00:59:58,194 --> 00:59:59,957
Sure. Glad we could help.

1070
01:00:00,029 --> 01:00:02,725
Yeah, and we never
seen it done twice in a row.

1071
01:00:02,799 --> 01:00:03,959
- Mm-mmm.
- What?

1072
01:00:04,033 --> 01:00:06,695
Be interesting to see how
the bull takes being slapped

1073
01:00:06,769 --> 01:00:09,135
- now that he's alert.
- Mm-hmm.

1074
01:00:09,205 --> 01:00:10,638
[both] Alert?

1075
01:00:11,674 --> 01:00:13,642
- [bellowing]
- [panting]

1076
01:00:13,710 --> 01:00:15,610
- [all yelling]
- Get back!

1077
01:00:15,678 --> 01:00:17,305
- Hurry!
- Hey! Come on.

1078
01:00:18,881 --> 01:00:20,815
- [screaming]
- [all groan]

1079
01:00:20,883 --> 01:00:22,680
Ow! [groans]

1080
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:27,617
- He coming back!
- [all shouting]

1081
01:00:28,858 --> 01:00:29,882
Bull!

1082
01:00:29,959 --> 01:00:33,156
He coming back!
He coming back! Oh...!

1083
01:00:33,229 --> 01:00:36,926
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Ah! He almost got me!

1084
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,366
Come on! What's this bully want?
Come on, bully!

1085
01:00:39,435 --> 01:00:42,427
You don't wanna use mockery!
That never works!

1086
01:00:42,505 --> 01:00:43,938
Cowboy's in trouble!

1087
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:47,302
Maybe if you just
try to reason with it!

1088
01:00:47,377 --> 01:00:49,777
- He's coming back for more! Look out!
- Whoa!

1089
01:00:49,846 --> 01:00:53,009
He's more afraid of you
than you are of him!

1090
01:00:53,082 --> 01:00:54,515
[sheriff] Watch out!

1091
01:00:54,584 --> 01:00:56,415
Watch out, watch out.
Come on!

1092
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:58,386
- Come on, let's go, let's go!
- Oh!

1093
01:01:02,825 --> 01:01:04,292
What?!

1094
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:08,763
- [Woody] Yeah, man, this is living!
- Yeah, we slapped a bull on the ass!

1095
01:01:08,831 --> 01:01:10,196
- Yes, sir!
- Yeah!

1096
01:01:10,266 --> 01:01:12,166
[sheriff] Yeah, you sure did.

1097
01:01:12,235 --> 01:01:15,466
- You sure did!
- [Bobby] Hey, did y'all see my moves?

1098
01:01:15,538 --> 01:01:18,598
I was shaking and baking
just like the NFL, baby!

1099
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:20,506
You hear what I'm saying?

1100
01:01:20,576 --> 01:01:23,807
I delivered it
right to the end zo...!

1101
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:26,713
[~ Kiss You All Over]

1102
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:36,253
[singing]

1103
01:01:42,298 --> 01:01:44,858
- Hey, look at him.
- He threw Bobby ten feet in the air.

1104
01:01:44,934 --> 01:01:47,630
Hey, man, that damn bull
kept following me around.

1105
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:51,037
- You think it was my cologne?
- What are you wearing, Rodeo Clown?

1106
01:01:51,107 --> 01:01:52,802
- Hold on...
- So now you got jokes?

1107
01:01:52,875 --> 01:01:55,105
- [laughing]
- Hey, Woody, you know,

1108
01:01:55,178 --> 01:01:58,909
I apologize for saying you had
ego issues earlier. All right?

1109
01:01:58,981 --> 01:02:00,539
I'm sorry I called you a pussy.

1110
01:02:02,251 --> 01:02:04,515
You didn't call me a pussy.

1111
01:02:04,587 --> 01:02:07,920
No, not to your face,
but that's what I was thinking!

1112
01:02:07,990 --> 01:02:11,221
Hey, we're just saying how much fun
this trip's turned out to be.

1113
01:02:11,294 --> 01:02:14,024
I was so close this time!
So close!

1114
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:15,663
What's the matter, Dudley?

1115
01:02:16,232 --> 01:02:18,257
The waitress. I think she likes me.

1116
01:02:18,334 --> 01:02:20,325
- [both] Good.
- No, it's not good.

1117
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:22,394
She told me to meet her
on the dance floor.

1118
01:02:22,472 --> 01:02:23,837
- So?
- So? Go dance.

1119
01:02:23,906 --> 01:02:27,103
I can't go on the dance floor.
You know what I look like.

1120
01:02:27,176 --> 01:02:29,838
The music moves me,
but it moves me ugly.

1121
01:02:29,912 --> 01:02:32,745
Well, do that... sprinkler thing
you did at my wedding.

1122
01:02:32,815 --> 01:02:34,612
- Yeah.
- I can't do the sprinkler.

1123
01:02:34,684 --> 01:02:37,016
I've gotta... I need to...

1124
01:02:38,921 --> 01:02:40,354
- No.
- Yes.

1125
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:41,720
I said no.

1126
01:02:41,791 --> 01:02:44,851
[Woody] Why don't we keep it simple,
why don't we just, uh...

1127
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:47,862
We'll do the lindy.
I'll be the guy, you be the girl.

1128
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:50,421
There we go.
And it's just... Remember?

1129
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:52,764
- OK. Yeah, right.
- It's one and two

1130
01:02:52,835 --> 01:02:55,235
and three and four,
and turn her around,

1131
01:02:55,304 --> 01:02:57,568
- and start over again.
- Do it two times, and...

1132
01:02:57,640 --> 01:02:59,437
- Whatever you want.
- I'll be the guy.

1133
01:02:59,509 --> 01:03:01,568
- Be the guy, I'll be the girl.
- OK. Ready.

1134
01:03:01,644 --> 01:03:04,477
And one and two
and three and four.

1135
01:03:04,547 --> 01:03:08,449
One and two and three and four,
and turn me around and...

1136
01:03:08,518 --> 01:03:10,850
- Oh, yeah! Now we're...
- Oh, OK, that's enough.

1137
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:13,582
- That's, uh, good lesson.
- What? No, wait. Is that it?

1138
01:03:13,656 --> 01:03:16,216
- Yeah, that's enough.
- That's just a pocket knife.

1139
01:03:16,292 --> 01:03:18,157
[up-tempo music plays]

1140
01:03:18,227 --> 01:03:20,559
There she is.
You're ready. Go.

1141
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:22,530
- Yeah, let's do it.
- I'm ready.

1142
01:03:22,598 --> 01:03:24,725
You're ready.
Come on. Go.

1143
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:51,957
[laughing]

1144
01:03:52,028 --> 01:03:53,359
Yeah!

1145
01:03:59,435 --> 01:04:01,403
- [woman] Whoo!
- Check it out.

1146
01:04:11,747 --> 01:04:13,715
- [gasps] Oh!
- Ahh!

1147
01:04:13,783 --> 01:04:15,512
[all] Oh! Whoa, whoa.

1148
01:04:18,888 --> 01:04:20,412
[both] He's panicking.

1149
01:04:49,819 --> 01:04:52,344
Hey! That's my phone! [grunts]

1150
01:04:52,421 --> 01:04:54,446
Your minutes just expired.

1151
01:04:55,925 --> 01:04:59,383
- Baby! Baby, it's Murdock.
- Tell me you found them.

1152
01:04:59,462 --> 01:05:02,022
We did. They're in Madrid.

1153
01:05:02,098 --> 01:05:05,534
[cackles] Good! Good, good,
good, good. I like Madrid!

1154
01:05:05,601 --> 01:05:07,569
The ground is soft enough
to bury them.

1155
01:05:07,637 --> 01:05:09,605
You want us to
smack 'em around a little?

1156
01:05:09,672 --> 01:05:11,071
[Jack] No! No! Listen to me!

1157
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:13,472
You just make sure
they stay there. OK?

1158
01:05:13,542 --> 01:05:15,567
But do not touch them.
They're mine.

1159
01:05:15,645 --> 01:05:18,011
I wanna feel their
bones break under my fists.

1160
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:19,775
Sounds like
a good beating, Jack.

1161
01:05:19,849 --> 01:05:21,817
We'll leave 'em for you, then.

1162
01:05:23,386 --> 01:05:26,446
Anyone else want some
Wild Hog for breakfast?

1163
01:05:26,522 --> 01:05:27,853
[all cheering]

1164
01:05:27,924 --> 01:05:31,018
- [man] Yee-ha!
- [light music playing]

1165
01:05:31,961 --> 01:05:33,451
[spits]

1166
01:05:33,529 --> 01:05:35,861
You expect me to pay
for this piss-warm beer?

1167
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:38,366
Here, you can have it back.

1168
01:05:38,434 --> 01:05:42,871
- [laughing]
- [moaning]

1169
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:45,339
If we drank piss,
we'd drink it cold!

1170
01:05:46,742 --> 01:05:47,902
What?!

1171
01:05:49,178 --> 01:05:51,043
Wait, guys, guys,
guys, guys, look...

1172
01:05:51,113 --> 01:05:53,104
We don't drink piss!

1173
01:05:54,784 --> 01:05:56,752
- [man] Hey, hey.
- [chortling]

1174
01:05:56,819 --> 01:05:59,151
Hey, Woody.
Maybe it's time to give these guys

1175
01:05:59,221 --> 01:06:00,950
another one of your famous talks.

1176
01:06:01,023 --> 01:06:04,652
I think we just avoid them, OK?
I've handled this legally. We should go.

1177
01:06:04,727 --> 01:06:07,787
You know what? I'm talking
to these assholes this time, Woody.

1178
01:06:07,863 --> 01:06:09,490
You shouldn't have to do it twice.

1179
01:06:09,565 --> 01:06:12,261
You took care of them
the last time, and I just sat there.

1180
01:06:12,335 --> 01:06:15,532
But this time, you know what?
They wanna see rage? Watch me.

1181
01:06:15,604 --> 01:06:17,469
- Bobby, Bob...
- Whoa!

1182
01:06:18,207 --> 01:06:19,606
[Bobby] Hey, assholes!

1183
01:06:19,675 --> 01:06:22,872
You boys got a hell of a lot of trouble
coming. You know that, right?

1184
01:06:22,945 --> 01:06:24,207
I'm gonna tell you again,

1185
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:27,807
like my friend told your stupid-ass,
cracker-ass, inbred buddies...

1186
01:06:27,883 --> 01:06:29,350
Did he just say "cracker"?

1187
01:06:29,418 --> 01:06:31,079
- "Cracker-ass."
- Oh, perfect.

1188
01:06:31,153 --> 01:06:34,020
You touch us, and we'll
sue your ass so hard,

1189
01:06:34,090 --> 01:06:36,456
you'll be taking out
a loan just to piss.

1190
01:06:36,525 --> 01:06:40,586
Now, if that ain't clear enough
for you, maybe this is: Splash.

1191
01:06:40,663 --> 01:06:42,654
Huh? Got it?
Did I get it in your mouth?

1192
01:06:42,732 --> 01:06:45,633
Splash! Splash! Splash!
Did I get you on some of that?

1193
01:06:45,701 --> 01:06:47,328
You crossed
a little line there.

1194
01:06:47,403 --> 01:06:50,236
No, no, no, no, no!
It ain't worth it, man.

1195
01:06:50,306 --> 01:06:51,967
Jack'll kill us if we touch him.

1196
01:06:52,041 --> 01:06:53,975
- So just...
- Break some of that up.

1197
01:06:54,043 --> 01:06:55,874
Got a little treat for you.

1198
01:06:55,945 --> 01:06:57,708
Huh? Break a little of that up.

1199
01:06:57,780 --> 01:07:00,340
[all exclaiming]

1200
01:07:00,416 --> 01:07:02,611
Can you hear that?
Can you hear that?

1201
01:07:02,685 --> 01:07:04,846
Uhh! Uhh!

1202
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:06,649
Uhhh!

1203
01:07:06,722 --> 01:07:09,691
- That's not a discussion.
- No, that's a lawsuit.

1204
01:07:09,759 --> 01:07:11,556
- [grunting]
- [groaning]

1205
01:07:11,627 --> 01:07:15,393
- Aw, look at that.
- [groans] What?!

1206
01:07:17,933 --> 01:07:19,161
That's gonna stain.

1207
01:07:19,235 --> 01:07:22,830
Ha! You boys look like you
belong on a couple of hot dogs.

1208
01:07:22,905 --> 01:07:24,736
[chuckles] Now,

1209
01:07:24,807 --> 01:07:29,335
If there's any other Del Fuegos
that need that message repeated,

1210
01:07:29,412 --> 01:07:31,437
you tell them
that the Wild Hogs...

1211
01:07:35,084 --> 01:07:36,915
...are right here in Madrid, baby...

1212
01:07:36,986 --> 01:07:38,954
...ready to explain it again.

1213
01:07:39,021 --> 01:07:41,285
- You got that?
- [panting]

1214
01:07:41,357 --> 01:07:43,052
I said you got that?!

1215
01:07:43,125 --> 01:07:44,786
- [crunching]
- [all wince]

1216
01:07:44,860 --> 01:07:46,953
Sweet mother of mercy!

1217
01:07:47,029 --> 01:07:48,860
- [gasping]
- Huh?!

1218
01:07:48,931 --> 01:07:50,398
[grumbling]

1219
01:07:50,466 --> 01:07:54,698
He don't want it.
He don't want it. I'm hungry.

1220
01:07:54,770 --> 01:07:56,704
[all cheering]

1221
01:07:56,772 --> 01:07:58,000
Let's evacuate! Come on!

1222
01:07:59,275 --> 01:08:02,733
- [country music plays]
- [people hooting]

1223
01:08:02,812 --> 01:08:05,975
- Beer, here!
- Wild Hogs, I gotta tell you,

1224
01:08:06,048 --> 01:08:08,243
you don't know
how many broken windows

1225
01:08:08,317 --> 01:08:09,841
you guys saved this town.

1226
01:08:09,919 --> 01:08:13,355
Sheriff, it's the least we could do
for our new friends here in Madrid.

1227
01:08:13,422 --> 01:08:15,720
- Right, Bobby?
- [laughing] Wild Hogs!

1228
01:08:15,791 --> 01:08:18,089
[all] Wild Hogs!

1229
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:19,923
That's some good work
you did there.

1230
01:08:19,995 --> 01:08:21,223
Hey, thank you, sheriff.

1231
01:08:21,297 --> 01:08:24,664
Now look, you know, if you need
something done, just come to me.

1232
01:08:24,733 --> 01:08:27,293
You know what I mean?
'Cause I will beat shit down.

1233
01:08:27,369 --> 01:08:29,394
Let's say them peanuts
are bothering you.

1234
01:08:29,472 --> 01:08:31,804
Huh? I don't wanna hear it!
I don't wanna hear it!

1235
01:08:31,874 --> 01:08:34,843
What'd the sheriff tell you?
What'd the town people tell you?

1236
01:08:34,910 --> 01:08:37,378
What the...?
You know what I mean?

1237
01:08:37,446 --> 01:08:40,847
I ain't got no problem with it.
I ain't got no problem with it.

1238
01:08:40,916 --> 01:08:44,113
Yeah. Yeah.
That's all right.

1239
01:08:44,186 --> 01:08:47,485
This is great. Right, Woody?

1240
01:08:47,556 --> 01:08:50,548
- Huh?
- You all right?

1241
01:08:53,362 --> 01:08:54,351
Yeah...

1242
01:08:55,831 --> 01:08:57,298
- I'm gonna call Kelly.
- Yeah.

1243
01:08:57,366 --> 01:08:59,630
Remind her just what
kind of a stud she married.

1244
01:08:59,702 --> 01:09:02,569
All right,
yeah, you do that.

1245
01:09:03,906 --> 01:09:05,840
[cries]

1246
01:09:05,908 --> 01:09:07,375
Hey, hey, Bobby!

1247
01:09:07,443 --> 01:09:09,604
Next time, I handle
those bozos, eh?

1248
01:09:09,678 --> 01:09:12,442
The wrath of Dudley!
Wild Hogs!

1249
01:09:12,515 --> 01:09:14,642
[all] Wild Hogs!

1250
01:09:14,717 --> 01:09:17,151
Tequila, on the Wild Hogs.

1251
01:09:20,656 --> 01:09:23,022
In New Mexico.
We actually slapped a bull.

1252
01:09:23,092 --> 01:09:24,957
Slapped it right on the ass.

1253
01:09:25,027 --> 01:09:27,154
You have no idea
how turned on I am right now,

1254
01:09:27,229 --> 01:09:29,697
- but please be careful.
- We're like celebrities.

1255
01:09:29,765 --> 01:09:32,029
- Well, Bobby is.
- Man, I crush them cashews.

1256
01:09:32,101 --> 01:09:34,126
- Macadamia nuts?
- Oh, macadamia nut?

1257
01:09:34,203 --> 01:09:35,431
I'd kick it out the park.

1258
01:09:35,504 --> 01:09:38,166
Hey! And guess who
dropped by to say hello.

1259
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:40,731
Karen. Yeah, I think
she's feeling a little lonely.

1260
01:09:40,809 --> 01:09:42,401
- Who's that?
- It's Doug.

1261
01:09:42,478 --> 01:09:44,639
Says they're having
a great time on the trip.

1262
01:09:44,713 --> 01:09:46,476
Kelly, don't tell her
about the...

1263
01:09:46,549 --> 01:09:48,039
Road trip?!

1264
01:09:50,686 --> 01:09:52,950
Hey! Dudley,
don't you wanna come inside?

1265
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:55,183
I'm fine. I'm just gonna, um,

1266
01:09:55,257 --> 01:09:57,953
sit out here
for a little while, I think.

1267
01:09:58,027 --> 01:10:00,052
OK. You OK?

1268
01:10:00,863 --> 01:10:03,593
I'm fine. I'm... uh...

1269
01:10:07,169 --> 01:10:08,659
No, the truth is I'm not OK.

1270
01:10:08,737 --> 01:10:11,001
The truth is I like you a lot, Maggie.

1271
01:10:13,676 --> 01:10:16,236
I'm liking you a lot too.

1272
01:10:16,312 --> 01:10:19,406
See, that's what I was afraid of.

1273
01:10:20,449 --> 01:10:22,974
That you would like me
without knowing...

1274
01:10:23,052 --> 01:10:25,282
Without me telling you...

1275
01:10:28,624 --> 01:10:30,717
I'm not a cool biker, Maggie.

1276
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:33,960
I'm not a cool anything.

1277
01:10:34,029 --> 01:10:35,758
I'm a computer programmer.

1278
01:10:35,831 --> 01:10:37,992
I'm just a geek.

1279
01:10:38,901 --> 01:10:42,564
I'm sorry if you thought
I was somebody that I'm not.

1280
01:10:49,712 --> 01:10:52,909
Mm-mm. You're not a geek.

1281
01:10:56,685 --> 01:10:59,017
- You're a lot of fun.
- Hmm.

1282
01:11:01,924 --> 01:11:04,654
And you're really honest.

1283
01:11:07,796 --> 01:11:09,991
And you're really sweet.

1284
01:11:13,769 --> 01:11:16,499
You're the kind of guy
that's hard to find.

1285
01:11:24,413 --> 01:11:26,711
- Sorry.
- [laughs]

1286
01:11:26,782 --> 01:11:28,909
Try again. One more time.

1287
01:11:29,952 --> 01:11:31,681
[chuckles]

1288
01:11:34,056 --> 01:11:36,388
[Woody] All right, Bobby!
All gassed up!

1289
01:11:37,893 --> 01:11:41,659
- Whoo! All gassed up, baby!
- All right. Let's get Dudley. Let's go!

1290
01:11:41,730 --> 01:11:43,357
- Clive, what's up?
- Hey! My man!

1291
01:11:43,432 --> 01:11:45,627
What you know? No good?
All right. OK.

1292
01:11:45,701 --> 01:11:48,727
We're going to high altitudes.
We should check tire pressure.

1293
01:11:48,804 --> 01:11:50,465
Whoa, no, no, little buddy.

1294
01:11:50,539 --> 01:11:52,473
We gotta ride.
We gotta get going, OK?

1295
01:11:52,541 --> 01:11:54,941
We got new experiences
and new locations, right?

1296
01:11:55,010 --> 01:11:57,945
We can't leave, man.
I'm like the mayor of this town.

1297
01:11:58,013 --> 01:12:00,641
- My people need me.
- I said we're leaving!

1298
01:12:01,750 --> 01:12:02,978
Hey, guys.

1299
01:12:03,052 --> 01:12:05,077
We decided we wanna
have breakfast here.

1300
01:12:05,154 --> 01:12:07,349
Come on! Hey, cowboy!
Let's saddle up, OK?

1301
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:09,653
You're burning daylight. Let's go!

1302
01:12:09,725 --> 01:12:11,716
Got a problem with
hanging a few minutes?

1303
01:12:11,794 --> 01:12:13,489
Do I look like
I have a problem? Do I?

1304
01:12:13,562 --> 01:12:14,927
- Yeah.
- Yes.

1305
01:12:14,997 --> 01:12:17,397
There you go again.
Saying the weirdest shit.

1306
01:12:17,466 --> 01:12:20,560
- [engines revving]
- [indistinct shouting]

1307
01:12:28,677 --> 01:12:30,907
Del Fuegos!
Hide the bikes! Quick!

1308
01:12:30,979 --> 01:12:33,209
- [Dudley] Why, why?
- Just do it! Trust me!

1309
01:12:33,282 --> 01:12:37,048
What's wrong?
Why are we hiding?

1310
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:39,781
- What's going on?
- [Dudley] I don't know.

1311
01:12:50,632 --> 01:12:52,827
- Oh, God!
- Hey! Why are we hiding?

1312
01:12:52,901 --> 01:12:55,028
You took care of this
already, didn't you?

1313
01:12:55,104 --> 01:12:56,696
No, not like you think, OK?

1314
01:12:56,772 --> 01:12:59,240
Well, what is it that I think?

1315
01:12:59,308 --> 01:13:01,469
I didn't really talk to them, OK?

1316
01:13:01,543 --> 01:13:04,011
- You serious?
- [Doug] I knew something was wrong.

1317
01:13:04,079 --> 01:13:06,070
Dudley, you're like,
"I'm all stupid...

1318
01:13:06,148 --> 01:13:07,172
Not Dudley's fault!

1319
01:13:07,249 --> 01:13:09,740
...take my bike, give me
a piece of junk, I'm happy."

1320
01:13:09,818 --> 01:13:11,809
You're all,
"I'm scared. Let's get out."

1321
01:13:11,887 --> 01:13:13,286
- Whatever.
- It's our fault?

1322
01:13:13,355 --> 01:13:15,346
The Del Fuegos are all,
"You're nothing.

1323
01:13:15,424 --> 01:13:17,517
- We're real bikers."
- This isn't about us!

1324
01:13:17,593 --> 01:13:19,584
- What did you do?
- What did you do, Woody?

1325
01:13:20,629 --> 01:13:23,223
I... [murmuring]

1326
01:13:24,099 --> 01:13:26,932
I cut the gas lines
of their bikes.

1327
01:13:27,669 --> 01:13:28,966
And then I...

1328
01:13:29,037 --> 01:13:32,063
- What?
- Maybe blew up their bar.

1329
01:13:32,141 --> 01:13:33,904
- Oh!
- Ah, perfect!

1330
01:13:33,976 --> 01:13:36,877
- [Dudley] Oh, we're dead!
- Oh, come on!

1331
01:13:36,945 --> 01:13:39,243
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!

1332
01:13:39,314 --> 01:13:41,748
That means they're
just here to kill us.

1333
01:13:47,456 --> 01:13:49,686
No sign of 'em, Jack.

1334
01:13:49,758 --> 01:13:51,953
[growling]

1335
01:13:53,262 --> 01:13:55,287
Wild Hogs!

1336
01:13:55,364 --> 01:13:58,424
Come out, come out,
wherever you are!

1337
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:00,968
I finally meet a girl,
and now I'm gonna die.

1338
01:14:01,036 --> 01:14:03,231
So all the mustard
and the ketchup...

1339
01:14:03,305 --> 01:14:05,239
...didn't help the situation, huh?

1340
01:14:05,307 --> 01:14:07,104
Ohhh!

1341
01:14:07,176 --> 01:14:10,839
[Jack] Oh, you don't
wanna come out? We'll wait!

1342
01:14:11,914 --> 01:14:14,246
There's only one road
out of this town!

1343
01:14:14,316 --> 01:14:16,250
We own it!

1344
01:14:16,318 --> 01:14:20,084
Me and my boys will be
in this lovely little diner here!

1345
01:14:20,155 --> 01:14:24,819
Get out of here!
The longer you keep us waiting,

1346
01:14:24,893 --> 01:14:29,262
the worse it's gonna get for
the peaceful town of Madrid!

1347
01:14:33,202 --> 01:14:37,002
Jack! I'm going
to ask you not to.

1348
01:14:37,072 --> 01:14:38,903
What did you say,
you little turd?

1349
01:14:38,974 --> 01:14:40,965
- What did he say?
- He called him a turd.

1350
01:14:43,045 --> 01:14:44,979
- [bikers laugh]
- Let's go!

1351
01:14:45,047 --> 01:14:47,277
Enjoy.

1352
01:14:47,349 --> 01:14:48,873
OK, I made a mistake.

1353
01:14:48,951 --> 01:14:51,977
Woody, we could have just
went home, man, and been fine.

1354
01:14:52,054 --> 01:14:54,579
Yeah, well, you know,
maybe I don't have a home.

1355
01:14:54,656 --> 01:14:56,590
[sighs] Claudia left me.

1356
01:14:56,658 --> 01:14:58,853
[sighing] Three months ago she left.

1357
01:14:58,927 --> 01:15:01,452
And then I fell apart.
Lost my clients.

1358
01:15:01,530 --> 01:15:03,464
And then I lost my job.

1359
01:15:03,532 --> 01:15:06,194
Now I got to sell the house
and I got to sell the car.

1360
01:15:06,268 --> 01:15:08,600
Can't even get
the lawn raked, you know.

1361
01:15:08,670 --> 01:15:11,264
I just got the bike and I got
you guys. That's all I got.

1362
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:14,036
So this trip is
all about you running away

1363
01:15:14,109 --> 01:15:17,135
from your miserable, screwed-up life?

1364
01:15:17,212 --> 01:15:19,874
[stuttering]
And you screw up our lives?

1365
01:15:19,948 --> 01:15:21,279
Asshole!

1366
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:25,582
I'm sorry about your situation,
Woody, but you're a lying asshole.

1367
01:15:25,654 --> 01:15:28,680
- Which is like an asshole's asshole.
- I thought that...

1368
01:15:28,757 --> 01:15:32,420
I thought that being a Wild Hog
meant something. But clearly it doesn't.

1369
01:15:32,494 --> 01:15:35,019
You don't care about me!
That's fine. I don't care.

1370
01:15:35,097 --> 01:15:37,156
It doesn't mean anything, Woody!

1371
01:15:37,232 --> 01:15:39,291
Remember, it's just
a patch my wife made!

1372
01:15:39,368 --> 01:15:41,461
We should go somewhere
to yell at each other

1373
01:15:41,537 --> 01:15:43,698
where there aren't people
trying to kill us.

1374
01:15:49,111 --> 01:15:50,601
Hey, Maggie.

1375
01:15:52,514 --> 01:15:54,573
Thanks for letting us
hide in your house.

1376
01:15:54,650 --> 01:15:55,776
Yeah, thanks.

1377
01:15:55,851 --> 01:15:59,116
It's hard not to when you're
screaming and kicking down the door.

1378
01:15:59,187 --> 01:16:00,677
Hey.

1379
01:16:00,756 --> 01:16:02,223
You OK?

1380
01:16:02,291 --> 01:16:05,021
Mm. Yeah.
Diner's the only thing I have.

1381
01:16:05,093 --> 01:16:07,618
If that gets destroyed, it's...

1382
01:16:07,696 --> 01:16:11,689
[sighs] But you're safe.
You guys are safe.

1383
01:16:11,767 --> 01:16:13,394
Now just stay put.

1384
01:16:13,468 --> 01:16:15,732
Nobody has to go out
there and be a hero.

1385
01:16:15,804 --> 01:16:17,396
You got that right.

1386
01:16:17,472 --> 01:16:21,033
- You guys aren't going out there?
- You're the sheriff. Why don't you go?

1387
01:16:21,109 --> 01:16:24,510
[sheriff] Like, sheriff
of a town of 500 people.

1388
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:27,572
I got my qualification
from a course on the Internet.

1389
01:16:27,649 --> 01:16:30,243
For arms training,
they just told us to play Doom.

1390
01:16:30,319 --> 01:16:32,253
I say we just wait it out,

1391
01:16:32,321 --> 01:16:34,414
they'll lose interest,
and they'll go.

1392
01:16:34,489 --> 01:16:36,650
Yeah, I agree.
Wait it out.

1393
01:16:37,993 --> 01:16:41,129
Hey. Where's Dudley?

1394
01:16:46,134 --> 01:16:48,364
[~ Electric Light Orchestra:
Showdown]

1395
01:16:48,437 --> 01:16:50,405
Oh, Dudley. Don't do that.

1396
01:16:55,243 --> 01:16:56,938
All right, you Del Fuegos...

1397
01:16:57,012 --> 01:16:59,173
[indistinct chattering]

1398
01:17:03,885 --> 01:17:04,874
Hey!

1399
01:17:08,423 --> 01:17:09,822
Let's end this.

1400
01:17:09,891 --> 01:17:12,883
At least one of you
came out to face the music.

1401
01:17:12,961 --> 01:17:14,792
Very brave.

1402
01:17:14,863 --> 01:17:16,125
But stupid.

1403
01:17:16,198 --> 01:17:18,530
I didn't come to face any music.

1404
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:21,728
I came here to stop you fellas
from hurting this diner,

1405
01:17:21,803 --> 01:17:24,931
which the love of my life
just happens to own.

1406
01:17:25,974 --> 01:17:30,502
So, if it's gotta get ugly...
I'll give you ugly.

1407
01:17:30,579 --> 01:17:34,845
- [glass shattering]
- [all laugh]

1408
01:17:38,153 --> 01:17:40,212
It slipped out of my glove.

1409
01:17:40,288 --> 01:17:43,382
Hey! Is it OK if I
tell people you guys did that?

1410
01:17:43,458 --> 01:17:45,221
I should be getting back.
It's late.

1411
01:17:45,293 --> 01:17:48,228
The guys are gonna be worrying.
We'll talk later.

1412
01:17:49,398 --> 01:17:51,298
Guys! Guys!

1413
01:17:51,366 --> 01:17:53,766
No, no. You don't get to
hide out here with us.

1414
01:17:53,835 --> 01:17:57,327
You get to hide outside with those
crazy people that wanna kill us.

1415
01:17:57,406 --> 01:18:00,239
- They got Dudley. Look out the window.
- What?

1416
01:18:00,308 --> 01:18:03,436
[Jack] All right, this is
what's gonna happen, Wild Hogs!

1417
01:18:03,512 --> 01:18:07,915
You're gonna pay
a disobedience fee of $1 0,000!

1418
01:18:07,983 --> 01:18:11,441
Plus another $40,000
to rebuild the bar!

1419
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:14,114
And if you wanna
see your friend alive again,

1420
01:18:14,189 --> 01:18:16,180
do not call the cops!

1421
01:18:16,258 --> 01:18:18,954
If you're not here
in a half an hour to settle this,

1422
01:18:19,027 --> 01:18:22,121
I'm gonna take the fine out
on your friend's legs!

1423
01:18:22,197 --> 01:18:24,825
I'm gonna break 'em
with this tire iron!

1424
01:18:24,900 --> 01:18:27,027
- [bikers yelling]
- Don't bring the money!

1425
01:18:27,102 --> 01:18:30,560
I'm a computer programmer!
I don't need my legs!

1426
01:18:30,639 --> 01:18:33,904
Fine! I'll break his hands!

1427
01:18:33,975 --> 01:18:35,499
- [bikers] Yeah!
- Oh, damn it.

1428
01:18:35,577 --> 01:18:37,010
Bring the money!

1429
01:18:37,079 --> 01:18:39,741
Definitely!
Definitely bring money!

1430
01:18:39,815 --> 01:18:43,080
- Get him out of here!
- Now! We need money!

1431
01:18:44,152 --> 01:18:45,483
[sniffing]

1432
01:18:45,554 --> 01:18:48,751
Dudley went to save the diner,
now they're gonna break his hands.

1433
01:18:48,824 --> 01:18:51,759
No, they're not. We're gonna...
We're gonna get him back.

1434
01:18:51,827 --> 01:18:54,819
I've called the highway patrol.
Gonna be here in two hours.

1435
01:18:54,896 --> 01:18:58,923
Hey, man. They said no cops, or else
they gonna take it out on Dudley.

1436
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,992
We don't wanna piss 'em off
until we get him out of their hands.

1437
01:19:02,070 --> 01:19:04,504
You know, he's not exactly
in their hands now, OK?

1438
01:19:04,573 --> 01:19:06,234
Why not?
He was sitting right...

1439
01:19:06,308 --> 01:19:09,641
- What the...?
- Get me down!

1440
01:19:09,911 --> 01:19:13,005
- [all laughing]
- Why? You look good up there!

1441
01:19:13,081 --> 01:19:15,345
You look like
a pinata with red hair!

1442

[all laughing]

1443
01:19:16,485 --> 01:19:20,012
I think... I think I'm gonna keep you
up there till your buddies come!

1444
01:19:20,088 --> 01:19:22,579
And then if they don't,
I'm gonna bust you open

1445
01:19:22,657 --> 01:19:25,558
and we're gonna see
what falls out! Ha!

[Dudley]
Bobby! Woody! Doug!

1447
01:19:29,164 --> 01:19:31,155
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know.

1448
01:19:31,233 --> 01:19:33,793
Well, I know what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna go get him.

1449
01:19:33,869 --> 01:19:36,269
[scoffs] There you go
talking crazy again.

1450
01:19:36,338 --> 01:19:39,034
- They will kill you.
- No, I'm not talking crazy.

1451
01:19:39,107 --> 01:19:42,304
I have three people left
in my life that I care about,

1452
01:19:42,377 --> 01:19:44,504
and I let you guys down.

1453
01:19:44,579 --> 01:19:46,979
Nah. I'd rather go out there
and make it go right

1454
01:19:47,048 --> 01:19:50,506
and die doing it than be the asshole
that screwed everything up.

Hey, hey, Woody.
Woody, where you going?

run in packs, baby?

- Wild Hogs, man.
- Wild Hogs.

1460
01:20:13,074 --> 01:20:16,407
All right, here's how it's gotta go.
I gotta get up to 30 miles an hour.

1461
01:20:16,478 --> 01:20:20,073
It's only duct tape holding that rope.
I'll get him by the trunk and grab him

1462
01:20:20,148 --> 01:20:23,140
- and I'll save Dudley.
- You'll need a distraction.

1463
01:20:23,218 --> 01:20:26,847
Together, guys. Together we can do this.
And I'm ready. I'm ready.

1464
01:20:26,922 --> 01:20:28,321
I'm ready.

- What?
- What's wrong?

1466
01:20:30,725 --> 01:20:32,852
- It's gonna sound kind of stupid.
- What?

1467
01:20:32,928 --> 01:20:35,556
Well, before I go,
I need one of you to yell,

- It helps motivate me.
- He's back!

It's the Golden Knight.

1482
01:21:23,545 --> 01:21:26,378
Wild Hogs, baby! Wild Hogs!

1483
01:21:26,448 --> 01:21:28,143
[muffled groaning, grunting]

1484
01:21:28,216 --> 01:21:30,241
OK, guys, slow down...
You're gonna...

1485
01:21:31,820 --> 01:21:33,583
Oh, no, no, no...
Ooh... Whoa!

1486
01:21:33,655 --> 01:21:37,022
- [all laughing]
- [Doug] Du-Dud-Dudley!

1487
01:21:37,092 --> 01:21:40,459
- Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho...
- All right, I gotcha. I gotcha.

1488
01:21:41,496 --> 01:21:44,863
- You having fun?
- That was amazing!

1489
01:21:44,933 --> 01:21:47,128
The tape was supposed to break!

1490
01:21:47,202 --> 01:21:48,191
Oh...

1491
01:21:48,270 --> 01:21:50,295
- [grunting]
- [bikers laugh]

1492
01:21:50,372 --> 01:21:52,272
- Oh...
- There it goes.

1493
01:21:52,340 --> 01:21:53,808
- Is there a problem?
- Come on. Come on!

1494
01:21:53,808 --> 01:21:55,173
- Is there a problem?
- Come on. Come on!

1495
01:21:55,243 --> 01:21:57,404
You burned down Damien's bar,

1496
01:21:57,479 --> 01:21:59,743
you pull this little
circus act out here,

1497
01:21:59,814 --> 01:22:03,079
now you're gonna see what
it's like when you mess with us.

1498
01:22:03,151 --> 01:22:05,278
- That's right.
- Burn down the diner!

1499
01:22:05,353 --> 01:22:07,218
- Torch it!
- Whoa, whoa, look, look...

1500
01:22:07,289 --> 01:22:08,916
We can come up
with the money,

1501
01:22:08,990 --> 01:22:10,514
I got a little bit
in my savings.

1502
01:22:10,592 --> 01:22:13,493
It was my fault. I did it.
I cut the fuel lines.

1503
01:22:13,561 --> 01:22:15,859
Let me deal with it.
Let these guys go.

1504
01:22:15,931 --> 01:22:19,264
No! We're not gonna pay any money
and we're not calling the cops.

1505
01:22:20,802 --> 01:22:22,702
We're gonna stand here and fight.

1506
01:22:25,674 --> 01:22:27,141
You don't want our money.

1507
01:22:27,208 --> 01:22:29,142
What do you need money for?
You're free.

1508
01:22:29,210 --> 01:22:32,873
You're just here to get what you get
from the townspeople all the time, fear.

1509
01:22:32,948 --> 01:22:36,076
'Cause you're scary people.
People'll do anything to stay safe,

1510
01:22:36,151 --> 01:22:39,177
including give up the biggest
part of their lives, adventure.

1511
01:22:39,254 --> 01:22:42,712
Let's have a little adventure, huh?
Let's fight. Let's dance, huh?

1512
01:22:42,791 --> 01:22:44,884
- Let's do it!
- Enough's enough.

1513
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:48,020
- Let's kick some Del Taco ass.
- Wait, wait, wait.

1514
01:22:48,096 --> 01:22:50,360
Do either of you guys
have a knife or scissors?

1515
01:22:50,432 --> 01:22:51,592
A nail clipper?

1516
01:22:51,666 --> 01:22:53,600
All right,
so how do we do this?

1517
01:22:53,668 --> 01:22:55,659
Like high school?
A little circle, huh?

1518
01:22:55,737 --> 01:22:57,227
- Oh!
- [bikers] Yeah!

1519
01:22:57,305 --> 01:22:59,899
Murdock, Red, Tiny.
Four on four.

1520
01:23:01,509 --> 01:23:03,909
- Body or face, pretty boy?
- Not the face.

1521
01:23:04,379 --> 01:23:07,007
[grunts] Ow!

1522
01:23:08,216 --> 01:23:10,207
[grunting]

1523
01:23:18,193 --> 01:23:20,661
- I'll take him.
- Thank you!

1524
01:23:21,863 --> 01:23:23,990
Yah! [shouts]

1525
01:23:24,065 --> 01:23:28,559
[yelling]

1526
01:23:31,806 --> 01:23:34,138
- Trade back! Trade back.
- I got him, I got him.

1527
01:23:34,209 --> 01:23:36,677
It's not really fair,
you know. I'm kinda tied up.

1528
01:23:39,614 --> 01:23:42,777
You ever see a hook off the jab?
Huh? Bring it!

1529
01:23:42,851 --> 01:23:44,819
[yells]

1530
01:23:46,388 --> 01:23:48,379
[both grunting]

1531
01:23:49,958 --> 01:23:52,290
- Oh!
- Let's have a little fun, baby.

1532
01:23:52,360 --> 01:23:53,384
Whew. Let's play.

1533
01:23:54,362 --> 01:23:55,829
Golden Glove, baby.

1534
01:23:57,232 --> 01:23:59,223
[shouting]

1535
01:24:00,568 --> 01:24:02,627
Ow! Ow! You hit my helmet.

1536
01:24:02,704 --> 01:24:04,535
Are you OK, man?
You hurt your hand?

1537
01:24:04,606 --> 01:24:06,073
That actually really hurt.

1538
01:24:06,141 --> 01:24:08,006
Whoa!

1539
01:24:08,443 --> 01:24:09,603
[groans]

1540
01:24:11,613 --> 01:24:13,740
Good shot! Get off!

1541
01:24:13,815 --> 01:24:15,077
Oh!

1542
01:24:15,150 --> 01:24:17,516
Uh-oh, no, no, no, no, don't...

1543
01:24:18,620 --> 01:24:19,780
- Throw sand!
- What?

1544
01:24:19,854 --> 01:24:21,685
- Throw sand!
- Yeah...

1545
01:24:23,124 --> 01:24:24,853
I didn't mean to aim there...

1546
01:24:26,628 --> 01:24:28,562
Ha! Whoo! Nice...

1547
01:24:29,564 --> 01:24:30,656
[laughs]

1548
01:24:30,732 --> 01:24:31,858
[groans]

1549
01:24:35,370 --> 01:24:38,203
Damn!
I done knocked out my boy!

1550
01:24:38,273 --> 01:24:42,004
- Come on. You all right?
- Ooh...

1551
01:24:45,346 --> 01:24:47,678
- [groaning]
- [cackling]

1552
01:24:49,284 --> 01:24:50,979
Well, that was easy.

1553
01:24:53,721 --> 01:24:55,814
- Come on.
- Burn down the diner!

1554
01:24:55,890 --> 01:24:59,382
- [bikers] Yeah!
- Come on!

1555
01:24:59,461 --> 01:25:02,521
- Oh, good. You want some more?
- Yeah, I got nothing to lose.

1556
01:25:02,597 --> 01:25:05,725
I got no wife.
No job. No house.

1557
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:09,201
I got my friends, though.
I got them till the end.

1558
01:25:09,971 --> 01:25:12,166
- Oh!
- That's great!

1559
01:25:12,240 --> 01:25:15,209
[Doug] You know, you know
what's so stupid about this?

1560
01:25:15,276 --> 01:25:19,736
We wanted to be like you guys. What I
see here is just a bunch of grown men

1561
01:25:19,814 --> 01:25:24,080
whose biggest decision in life is,
"Uh, sleeveless or, uh... sleeveless?

1562
01:25:24,152 --> 01:25:26,882
Do I shit behind the rock,
or over there by that bush?"

1563
01:25:27,489 --> 01:25:29,616
Grown men.
This is pathetic.

1564
01:25:29,691 --> 01:25:31,283
You go ahead
and kick our ass, OK?

1565
01:25:31,359 --> 01:25:33,987
Because we're not the posers.
You guys are the posers.

1566
01:25:34,629 --> 01:25:36,961
- Ow!
- [all laughing]

1567
01:25:37,031 --> 01:25:40,967
Hey! Do yourselves a favor
and stay down!

1568
01:25:41,035 --> 01:25:43,799
Twenty-five years
of being yelled at.

1569
01:25:43,872 --> 01:25:45,430
Man, I ain't taking this...

1570
01:25:48,676 --> 01:25:52,112
And I got a girlfriend.
Punch that out of me, bitches.

1571
01:25:53,314 --> 01:25:54,872
Hmm? [chuckles]

1572
01:26:00,355 --> 01:26:02,118
- Oh.
- Are we doing this?

1573
01:26:06,227 --> 01:26:07,990
- Let's do it.
- Yeah.

1574
01:26:08,062 --> 01:26:10,121
Come on.

1575
01:26:14,769 --> 01:26:17,829
- Come on.
- Come on.

1576
01:26:25,647 --> 01:26:27,012
You're kidding me, right?

1577
01:26:31,486 --> 01:26:33,010
What's wrong with you guys?

1578
01:26:34,923 --> 01:26:37,187
[Jack] All right!
You wanna keep going?

1579
01:26:37,258 --> 01:26:39,783
- [car door slams]
- I don't think so.

1580
01:26:39,861 --> 01:26:44,730
You're done, Jack.
You Del Fuegos! You are done!

1581
01:26:44,799 --> 01:26:47,063
And we want you
out of our town, now.

1582
01:26:47,135 --> 01:26:49,797
- And who's "we"?
- All of us.

1583
01:26:49,871 --> 01:26:53,534
[cackling]

1584
01:26:53,608 --> 01:26:56,577
If four people could
stand up to a gang of bikers,

1585
01:26:56,644 --> 01:26:58,509
I guess we can too!

1586
01:26:58,580 --> 01:27:01,344
Well, we'll fight you and
the Children of the Corn too.

1587
01:27:01,416 --> 01:27:05,910
'Cause the Del Fuegos don't
back down! This is our highway.

1588
01:27:05,987 --> 01:27:08,581
And we're gonna
defend our highway.

1589
01:27:08,656 --> 01:27:10,453
[man] Wrong, Jack.

1590
01:27:12,160 --> 01:27:14,651
It's my highway.

1591
01:27:14,729 --> 01:27:16,026
Blade.

1592
01:27:17,031 --> 01:27:18,965
Hi, Maggie.

1593
01:27:20,768 --> 01:27:24,898
- Hmm. Bar burned down.
- Yeah.

1594
01:27:24,973 --> 01:27:27,840
These posers, these
four posers right here.

1595
01:27:27,909 --> 01:27:31,845
Four guys
stand off 50 bikers...

1596
01:27:33,248 --> 01:27:35,409
- ...and they're the posers?
- Yeah.

1597
01:27:35,483 --> 01:27:37,417
They burnt down
the bar that you built.

1598
01:27:37,485 --> 01:27:38,782
It was a shithole.

1599
01:27:38,853 --> 01:27:41,321
I insured it for
twice what it was worth.

1600
01:27:41,389 --> 01:27:42,879
The guys did me a favor.

1601
01:27:42,957 --> 01:27:45,721
We were just following
the code that you wrote.

1602
01:27:45,793 --> 01:27:48,091
Why do you think
I don't wear the colors, Jack?

1603
01:27:48,162 --> 01:27:49,789
Why do you think I ride alone?

1604
01:27:49,864 --> 01:27:51,923
'Cause you don't
know about it anymore.

1605
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:55,731
I think you all oughta get back on your
bikes and go out and ride the highway

1606
01:27:55,803 --> 01:27:58,067
until you remember
what riding's all about.

1607
01:27:59,240 --> 01:28:00,969
Let it go, Jack.

1608
01:28:13,788 --> 01:28:15,278
OK, Pop.

1609
01:28:17,125 --> 01:28:19,252
Takes after his mom.

1610
01:28:19,327 --> 01:28:21,761
[all cheering]

1611
01:28:28,002 --> 01:28:29,560
[exhaling heavily]

1612
01:28:29,637 --> 01:28:32,003
Man, that was like
level 1 2 of Doom.

1613
01:28:33,808 --> 01:28:35,469
The posers.

1614
01:28:35,543 --> 01:28:37,875
- What do you guys call yourselves?
- I'm Woody.

1615
01:28:37,945 --> 01:28:39,071
- I'm Bobby.
- I'm Doug.

1616
01:28:39,147 --> 01:28:41,081
No, no, no. You all riding together?

1617
01:28:41,149 --> 01:28:43,447
- What do you...
- [all] Hogs! Wild Hogs.

1618
01:28:43,518 --> 01:28:45,543
Wild...
Yeah, Wild Hogs.

1619
01:28:46,788 --> 01:28:50,690
Well, Wild Hogs,
ride hard or stay home.

1620
01:28:50,758 --> 01:28:54,524
- Yeah.
- Oh, and, guys, lose the watches.

1621
01:28:57,699 --> 01:28:59,360
- Freedom, baby.
- We did it, babe.

1622
01:28:59,434 --> 01:29:02,528
All day. All day.

1623
01:29:02,603 --> 01:29:06,095
Hey! Hey! We're Wild Hogs!
The saga continues!

1624
01:29:19,354 --> 01:29:21,481
[tires squealing]

1625
01:29:21,556 --> 01:29:22,818
What the hell?

1626
01:29:22,890 --> 01:29:25,916
What in the world
is going on around here?

1627
01:29:27,095 --> 01:29:29,290
Plumbing conference?

1628
01:29:29,364 --> 01:29:30,763
Have you lost your mind?

1629
01:29:30,832 --> 01:29:32,231
Shut up, Doug!

1630
01:29:32,300 --> 01:29:35,030
Bobby, who are these people,
and where are we at?

1631
01:29:35,103 --> 01:29:39,233
Well, obviously, I'm not at a...
plumbing conference in Cleveland, baby.

1632
01:29:39,307 --> 01:29:40,331
Oh, really?

1633
01:29:40,408 --> 01:29:42,433
Baby, I've been
fighting bikers all day,

1634
01:29:42,510 --> 01:29:44,671
this little Chinese
dude bust my nose,

1635
01:29:44,746 --> 01:29:46,543
I've been slapping bulls...

1636
01:29:46,614 --> 01:29:50,072
Bobby, I don't give a damn
about you fighting no bulls!

1637
01:29:50,151 --> 01:29:52,551
Now, I want you to get
your ass in that van

1638
01:29:52,620 --> 01:29:53,985
because we are going home.

1639
01:29:54,055 --> 01:29:56,216
I cannot believe you'd
deceive me like this!

1640
01:29:56,290 --> 01:29:57,917
- Karen...
- No, Bobby, I want...!

1641
01:29:57,992 --> 01:29:59,391
Karen!

1642
01:30:00,261 --> 01:30:02,058
Slow your roll.

1643
01:30:02,130 --> 01:30:05,224
Look, baby, I love you, OK?

1644
01:30:05,299 --> 01:30:07,358
But I'm tired of being talked at.

1645
01:30:07,435 --> 01:30:09,835
I don't talk at you, Bobby!

1646
01:30:09,904 --> 01:30:12,099
- I talk...
- Look at what you're doing now.

1647
01:30:12,173 --> 01:30:14,334
- [sighs]
- Come on. You feel me?

1648
01:30:14,409 --> 01:30:16,900
OK, baby, all right,
all right, I feel you.

1649
01:30:16,978 --> 01:30:19,173
Right now I just need
you to show me some love.

1650
01:30:19,247 --> 01:30:21,181
Just a little bit of love.

1651
01:30:21,883 --> 01:30:25,375
Oh... Mmm...

1652
01:30:25,453 --> 01:30:29,082
[smacking]
That's scrumptious.

1653
01:30:29,157 --> 01:30:31,148
You seriously got
in a fight with bikers?

1654
01:30:31,225 --> 01:30:33,557
A whole bunch of 'em.
We chased 'em out of town!

1655
01:30:33,628 --> 01:30:34,925
There was 50 of them.

1656
01:30:34,996 --> 01:30:36,361
- It was something.
- Fifty?

1657
01:30:36,431 --> 01:30:38,831
I gotta tell the guys
about this. That is awesome!

1658
01:30:38,900 --> 01:30:40,527
I'll be right back, OK?

1659
01:30:40,601 --> 01:30:42,262
Doug, are you sure you're OK?

1660
01:30:42,336 --> 01:30:43,564
[chuckles]

1661
01:30:43,638 --> 01:30:45,799
- Ow, ow, ow, ow...
- Oh, your ribs, your ribs.

1662
01:30:45,873 --> 01:30:47,864
- You're standing on my foot!
- Oh, sorry!

1663
01:30:47,942 --> 01:30:49,466
So I'll see you when I get back?

1664
01:30:49,544 --> 01:30:51,205
- Mm-hmm.
- All right?

1665
01:30:51,279 --> 01:30:54,578
- Mmm. I love you.
- I love you too, baby.

1666
01:30:54,649 --> 01:30:56,344
All right.

1667
01:31:02,190 --> 01:31:03,817
Get a room, baby.

1668
01:31:03,891 --> 01:31:06,621
Can we? Do we have time?

1669
01:31:06,694 --> 01:31:08,753
When are you
coming back through?

1670
01:31:08,830 --> 01:31:10,161
A biker never knows.

1671
01:31:10,231 --> 01:31:12,358
Maybe a week.

1672
01:31:12,433 --> 01:31:14,094
Maybe a month.

1673
01:31:14,969 --> 01:31:17,335
Six days, ten hours, 27 minutes,

1674
01:31:17,405 --> 01:31:20,397
give or take six minutes
for wind resistance.

1675
01:31:24,812 --> 01:31:27,645
Well, I sure do wish
you guys would stick around.

1676
01:31:27,715 --> 01:31:30,183
We got some riding to do, sheriff.
Thanks anyway.

1677
01:31:30,251 --> 01:31:31,741
Well, I'll just say it:

1678
01:31:31,819 --> 01:31:33,878
You fellas were
a blessing to this place.

1679
01:31:33,955 --> 01:31:36,014
I mean, I'm not gonna
get all emotional

1680
01:31:36,090 --> 01:31:38,615
like old hamburger head
over here always...

1681
01:31:40,628 --> 01:31:42,289
What did you
just call me?

1682
01:31:42,363 --> 01:31:45,230
Uh, see, when we walked up,
you were on my...

1683
01:31:45,299 --> 01:31:48,291
You son of a bitch!

1684
01:31:49,103 --> 01:31:51,503
Come on, Buck, I swear.
That's the first time!

1685
01:31:51,572 --> 01:31:54,097
- I don't wanna hear it!
- Well, honestly, you can't.

1686
01:31:54,175 --> 01:31:55,836
I heard that.

1687
01:31:55,910 --> 01:31:58,879
- Ready to ride, guys?
- Ready to ride, baby.

1688
01:31:58,946 --> 01:32:01,039
Let's see what the
West Coast has to offer.

1689
01:32:01,115 --> 01:32:03,310
Think there'll be
any trouble along the way?

1690
01:32:03,384 --> 01:32:05,318
Oh, I hope so.

1691
01:32:05,386 --> 01:32:07,320
Yeah, I like
the way you think.

1692
01:32:07,388 --> 01:32:09,413
I like the way you think.

1693
01:32:19,901 --> 01:32:21,493
[all gasp]

1694
01:32:26,941 --> 01:32:29,341
I'm OK!
I just hurt my face.

Wow.

1698
01:33:25,032 --> 01:33:27,899
- [Doug] Hey, we did it!
- [Woody] Woo-hoo!

1699
01:33:27,969 --> 01:33:29,561
Do you believe this?

1700
01:33:34,208 --> 01:33:36,938
- [Dudley] Hello!
- [Bobby] Whoa, my goodness.

1701
01:33:37,011 --> 01:33:39,309
Whoa, oh, no. Oh, no.
Oh! Whoa!

- Whoa! Ah!

1703

Whoa!

1704
01:33:43,284 --> 01:33:45,844
Whoa! Sorry, sorry.

1705
01:33:47,421 --> 01:33:49,855
Two thousand miles,
but I finally got it.

1706
01:33:49,924 --> 01:33:52,620
'Bout time, rookie!

1707
01:33:54,595 --> 01:33:58,156
- Lot of distractions.
- California, baby!

Welcome back
to Extreme Makeover: Home Edition.

1711
01:34:19,820 --> 01:34:22,118
Now, we've met
some incredible families,

1712
01:34:22,189 --> 01:34:24,453
but this could be
the saddest story we've...

1713
01:34:24,525 --> 01:34:25,787
We've ever seen.

1714
01:34:25,860 --> 01:34:28,021
This family has lost everything.

1715
01:34:28,095 --> 01:34:31,155
They've lost their home,
they've lost their history,

1716
01:34:31,232 --> 01:34:32,859
they've lost their heritage.

1717
01:34:32,933 --> 01:34:35,458
But this week, we've done
something about that.

1718
01:34:35,536 --> 01:34:38,699
So let's welcome back...
the Del Fuego family!

1719
01:34:38,773 --> 01:34:42,140
[all cheering]

1720
01:34:45,012 --> 01:34:46,604
Well, Jack, two months ago, man,

1721
01:34:46,681 --> 01:34:48,478
you lost the only home
you ever knew.

1722
01:34:48,549 --> 01:34:51,177
But thanks to a call
from your friends, the Wild Hogs,

1723
01:34:51,252 --> 01:34:52,514
we built you a new one.

1724
01:34:52,586 --> 01:34:54,554
[Dudley] That's so great.

1725
01:34:54,622 --> 01:34:57,682
They... He didn't have to
mention us. That's... Oh, man.

1726
01:34:57,758 --> 01:34:59,487
So you guys know what to say?

1727
01:34:59,560 --> 01:35:03,189
- Say it with me!
- [all] Bus driver, move that bus!

1728
01:35:03,264 --> 01:35:05,789
[all cheer]

1729
01:35:07,768 --> 01:35:09,736
Oh!

1730
01:35:10,438 --> 01:35:11,871
Wow!

1731
01:35:18,879 --> 01:35:21,677
[Ty] Usually we have some
pretty emotional reactions,

1732
01:35:21,749 --> 01:35:24,343
but, uh, Jack, you know, wow.

1733
01:35:24,418 --> 01:35:28,878
I'm not sure what
was going on with Jack.

1734
01:35:28,956 --> 01:35:30,514
[whimpering] Oh...

1735
01:35:30,591 --> 01:35:33,116
Thanks to our friends at Sears
and local breweries,

1736
01:35:33,194 --> 01:35:36,891
who provided state-of-the-art taps
and a year's supply of free beer!

1737
01:35:36,964 --> 01:35:39,228
[all cheering]

1738
01:35:40,768 --> 01:35:43,669
Oh, my God! That is so cool!

1739
01:35:43,738 --> 01:35:45,501
[screaming] That is so cool!

1740
01:35:45,573 --> 01:35:48,007
Cool as a parking lot
made out of real leather?

1741
01:35:48,075 --> 01:35:50,339
- Oh!
- [Murdock] That is so rad!

1742
01:35:50,411 --> 01:35:52,504
That is so [bleep] rad!

1743
01:35:55,983 --> 01:35:59,646
The bar was my home.
When it went down...

1744
01:35:59,720 --> 01:36:02,883
I felt... homeless.

1745
01:36:03,824 --> 01:36:07,351
Del Fuegos,
go check out your new home!

1746
01:36:12,566 --> 01:36:15,433
[Ty] Here's the thing, you're
talking about a bunch of guys

1747
01:36:15,503 --> 01:36:18,563
that grew up in broken homes.
They really didn't have a home.

1748
01:36:18,639 --> 01:36:20,800
And now they've got one.
With a bidet in it.

1749
01:36:20,875 --> 01:36:24,470
- Thank you!
- [cheering continues]

Thanks, America!
