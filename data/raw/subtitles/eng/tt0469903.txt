00:00:25,258 --> 00:00:28,557
<i>21 straight lines,
five yards apart,</i>

2
00:00:28,962 --> 00:00:30,725
<i>that's a football field.</i>

3
00:00:30,797 --> 00:00:33,425
<i>But there are other lines,
ones you don't see,</i>

4
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,163
<i>that run deeper and wider,
all the way through a country,</i>

5
00:00:37,737 --> 00:00:39,864
<i>and aren't part of any game.</i>

6
00:00:45,945 --> 00:00:48,573
Strong load right,
42 shovel pass. On one. On one.

7
00:00:48,648 --> 00:00:50,138
Ready?
- Break!

8
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:57,815
Whiskey, whiskey, 33!

9
00:00:58,658 --> 00:01:01,007
Been waiting for this, spook.

10
00:01:04,431 --> 00:01:06,422
I'm gonna kick your black
ass back to Africa, boy.

11
00:01:50,343 --> 00:01:53,141
I found another Pepsi.

12
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:58,647
<i>Pepsi Cola
hits the spot</i>

13
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:01,585
<i>12 full ounces, that's a lot
- 12 full ounces, that's a lot</i>

15
00:02:04,824 --> 00:02:07,258
<i>Pepsi Cola is the drink for you
- Pepsi Cola is the drink for you</i>

16
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:15,434
<i>America has been riding
the crest of a wave of a peaceful prosperity.</i>

17
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:19,102
<i>I believe
in this world to come.</i>

18
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:22,306
<i>I think it's going to
be a pretty good one.</i>

19
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:41,421
"When you say 'Budweiser,'

20
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:44,429
"you've said it all."
- "You've said it all."

21
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:56,265
What are you boys doing
north of Union Street?

22
00:02:59,078 --> 00:03:01,137
One of you better answer.

23
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:02,848
Just collecting bottles.

24
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:05,143
These are our
bottles up here.

25
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,519
Hey, guys!

26
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:21,864
Ain't but one
thing to do here.

27
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:25,062
Ernie, you
listening to me?

28
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:27,939
Ernie, now!

29
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:33,072
Ernie!

30
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:38,273
Ernie! Ernie!

31
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:40,486
This one must be stupid.

32
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:46,291
I'll tell you what,
you give us those bottles

33
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:48,759
and we won't
kick your black ass.

34
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:58,930
Got something to say?

35
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:01,006
No!

36
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,230
What?

37
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:04,776
Not only stupid,
but retarded.

38
00:04:05,144 --> 00:04:07,408
And a nigger,
how sad is that?

39
00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:11,615
Look, you've got three
seconds to drop those bottles.

40
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:15,113
One,

41
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:20,553
two,

42
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:24,557
three!

43
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:28,394
Get him.
- Get him.

44
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:47,612
<i>Dear Mr. Martin, it feels
strange to write about my life.</i>

45
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:52,780
<i>I can't tell you the exact moment
I knew what it was I wanted to be</i>

46
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:55,350
<i>or how I wanted
to make my mark.</i>

47
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:57,988
<i>Maybe it just felt
real good to run,</i>

48
00:04:58,064 --> 00:05:00,430
<i>or maybe one day,
out of the corner of my eye,</i>

49
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:04,095
<i>I saw tacklers reaching out
for me and dropping behind.</i>

50
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:10,340
<i>Back in 1949, at the age of
10, one thing I did know was,</i>

51
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:15,005
<i>I sure didn't want to be
remembered for running too slow.</i>

52
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:22,883
<i>People in town would always
ask, "What you running from?"</i>

53
00:05:22,955 --> 00:05:24,013
Hey, Will!

54
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:26,422
<i>I didn't know
then what I know now,</i>

55
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:29,791
<i>that I wasn't running from,
I was running to.</i>

56
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:34,364
After dinner we gonna
have an ice cream eating contest.

57
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:35,423
What do you
say about that?

58
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:37,264
Yeah, I like it.

59
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:39,196
Okay.

60
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:44,468
First Corinthians 15:10.

61
00:05:44,911 --> 00:05:45,969
Ernie.

62
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:47,512
Yes, Grandpa.

63
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,741
Why don't you read tonight?

64
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,711
You can do it.

65
00:05:57,824 --> 00:05:59,257
"But

66
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:03,793
"by the..."

67
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:10,164
Ernie, take a deep breath.

68
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:15,203
Okay, now try it again.

69
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:21,879
"But by the

70
00:06:23,182 --> 00:06:26,583
"grace of God I am what I am.

71
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,248
"And his grace...

72

"His grace...

"...which was bestowed..."

74
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:33,522
"...which was bestowed upon me

75
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:35,458
"was not in vain."

76

"But I labored more
abundantly than they all,

"yet not I,

"but the grace of
God which was with me."

79
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:53,235
The words, I know
they're in there

80
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:56,543
but they don't come out
straight all the time.

81
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:06,222
<i>That'll bring
Jackie Robinson up.</i>

82
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:09,056
He's wearing a Brooklyn
Dodgers uniform.

83
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:12,191
He's Negro and he's playing
for the Brooklyn Dodgers?

84
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:16,725
That's right, boys.
That there is Jackie Robinson.

85
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:20,065
<i>The windup
and the delivery.</i>

86
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:24,977
<i>And the drive deep into left field.
And it's a home run!</i>

87
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:34,115
<i>Jackie Robinson with a home
run, his 12th of the year,</i>

88
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:36,655
<i>and the crowd
roars at Ebbets Field.</i>

89
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:46,598
Now what? You gonna
stare at it all night?

90
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:50,231
This here is a man
who's doing a lot

91
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:51,892
without saying nothing.

92
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,975
Hey!
- Hey, Ernie.

93
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:03,877
Ernie!

94
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,013
Mama?

95
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:12,117
Mama!

96
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:17,120
<i>It's great
to have you back!</i>

97
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:19,130
So you still got that Chevy?
And what year is that?

98
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:20,859
It's a '39,
and you, too, Mama.

99
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:22,366
A '39 Chevy.

100
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:27,333
So, Marie, you have
some news for us?

101
00:08:29,141 --> 00:08:32,941
Yes, sir. Mama, Daddy,

102
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:38,472
Ernie, I got married again.

103
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,717
To a very nice man.

104
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:48,554
The main thing is I can
support you now, baby.

105
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:59,099
I want you to come back
and live with me in Elmira.

106
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:06,709
How far away is Elmira?

107
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:12,381
It's not far at all, baby.
It's just a few hours away.

108
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,155
I think you'll like it.

109
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,756
You gonna love it, baby.

110
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:28,592
Bye, Will.

111
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:29,657
Bye, Ernie.

112
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:35,574
So, I'll see you soon.

113
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:50,046
Come on, boys. Line up! Line up!
I got some new jerseys here for you.

114
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,451
Wait till you see these.

115
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:57,644
Here you go,
Mike, Aaron, Nick.

116
00:10:58,691 --> 00:11:00,625
Patrick, there's
one for you.

117
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:05,130
You been waiting for these, I know it.
Here you go, Peewee. Put it on.

118
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:06,657
Uh...

119
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:11,829
I'm sorry, boys.
That's all there are.

120
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:16,731
Don't worry. The other team won't
have any trouble recognizing you.

121
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:20,912
Come on! Huddle!

122
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,208
Reggie!

123
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:26,544
Davis.

124
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:30,121
Just give him the ball.

125
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,919
Ready?
- Ready!

126
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:34,818
Break!

127
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:38,124
Ready!

128
00:11:42,568 --> 00:11:43,796
Hike!

129
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:16,662
That your son?

130
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,136
Yes. Yes, it is.

131
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:21,696
<i>Al Malette,
Elmira Star-Gazette.</i>

132
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:23,902
What's his name?

133
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:27,677
Ernie.
His name is Ernie Davis.

134
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:30,709
Ernie Davis.

135
00:12:31,217 --> 00:12:32,377
Break!

136
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,128
So you're the man
who owns Jim Brown.

137
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:48,689
I own the team.
He's his own man. Hey, Jim!

138
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,030
I think you've
done enough of that.

139
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:51,899
Mr. Modell,
just a few more?

140
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:53,563
This is the last time he's
gonna be on this field.

141
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:56,005
You've got plenty, Rex.
Boys, thank you very much.

142
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:59,067
That's good, we got it.
Jim, come over here.

143
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:02,879
All right, fellas.
Take a couple like this.

144
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:04,006
Nice big smile, Jim.

145
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,481
Hey, Jim, you
think you're ready?

146
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:06,848
Right here, Jim, look
here. Right here...

147
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:09,581
So Jim Brown's gonna be wearing
a Cleveland Browns jersey.

148
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:10,849
How's it feel?

149
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:11,947
It feels right.

150
00:13:12,024 --> 00:13:13,252
Jim? Right here, Jim.

151
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:14,883
<i>Dan Boyle,
Chicago Sun.</i>

152
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,019
You had a terrific year
here at Syracuse, Jim.

153
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:20,532
Seven yards a carry, broke records,
took your team to the Cotton Bowl,

154
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:23,295
number one draft choice,
signed a big contract.

155
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:27,465
I'm guessing you're pretty happy
with the way things turned out.

156
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,509
I could be happier.
You left something out.

157
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:33,143
You talking about
the Heisman Trophy, Jim?

158
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:36,909
I didn't win that.
Actually, no Negro has ever won it.

159
00:13:37,349 --> 00:13:39,909
And you're saying
you should have?

160
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:45,852
Now, if I say that

161
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:48,658
the papers tomorrow will tell
the story of the angry Negro

162
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:50,854
who doesn't
know his place.

163
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,491
I know my place,
gentlemen.

164
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:56,424
It just may not be
where you like it.

165
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,026
Next question.

166
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,673
Hey, Coach.
Coach, let me ask you something.

167
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:10,738
How do you ever expect
to replace Jimmy Brown?

168
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:23,486
Glen Boyd, Cedar Rapids
High. Team won state.

169
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:27,831
He has a C average
but a tested IQ of 120.

170
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,333
That means he's lazy.

171
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:31,426
Ben, the kid has
a five-yard average.

172
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:33,664
I don't care.
He's lazy. I don't want him.

173
00:14:33,739 --> 00:14:35,570
Next!
- Wally Purdue,

174
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:38,269
Bridgeport Academy,
six varsity letters.

175
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:40,539
He's healing from
an ankle fracture but...

176
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:42,046
But bullshit!

177
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:46,075
Anybody else? Maybe someone
who isn't hurt or lazy?

178
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:49,549
Isn't there
a kid from Elmira?

179
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:53,623
Yeah, Ernie Davis.
Elmira Free Academy.

180
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:57,486
Running back, 1,300
yards on 179 carries.

181
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:01,624
Led his team to a state championship.
Why the hell didn't we look at him first?

182
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,895
Well, he's a
Negro boy, Ben.

183
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:08,272
Is this a new trend,
or is it just my luck?

184
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,568
It's a new trend.

185
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:13,674
He might remind you
of somebody we know.

186
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:17,810
Too old to butt heads
with another Jim Brown.

187
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:20,313
Roll it.

188
00:15:24,556 --> 00:15:27,047
There he is
on the left, number 55.

189
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:31,659
Right now, he's...
Now watch him here.

190
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:36,064
He breaks through both tackles and
look at that, into the secondary.

191
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:38,869
There he goes,
30-yard line,

192
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:42,403
40-yard line, 50,

193
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:47,605
40, 30, 20, 10.

194
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:52,979
Touchdown. Wow!

195
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:58,580
He have any offers yet?

196
00:15:58,657 --> 00:15:59,817
About 50.

197
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,088
Shit.

198
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:08,328
It's all chrome
inside there. Feel that.

199
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,630
No, no, no. Not that, that's the gas.
Better step on the brake.

200
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:11,727
Oh!

201
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:15,365
There you go. You got tiny legs.
She's gonna love this, right?

202
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:17,238
Mighty nice
car, Jim.

203
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:22,773
Do me a favor,
wait upstairs.

204
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:23,974
Okay then.

205
00:16:31,056 --> 00:16:34,992
What's on your mind, Coach?
I take it this isn't a social call.

206
00:16:35,527 --> 00:16:40,157
All right, look, there's this kid,
and I want you to help me recruit him.

207
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:42,632
You want me to help you?

208
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:44,933
You're leaving us a
hell of a hole, Jim.

209
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:49,168
And we are up against the big boys.
We've got Pitt, UCLA, Texas.

210
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:51,641
You mean he's colored.

211
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:53,177
He's a Negro, yes.

212
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:56,076
You can't talk to Negroes?

213
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:57,206
I can't...

214
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:03,116
I'm not good at that salesman stuff.
Not much of a dancer, you know that.

215
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:09,118
I know this wasn't the most welcoming
place for you, but that's not my fault.

216
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:12,595
I can only control what happens
on 100 yards of gridiron.

217
00:17:12,664 --> 00:17:14,859
But I do know Cleveland never
would have heard of you

218
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:17,663
if you hadn't come
here to play for me.

219
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:25,009
What I did here was on
my back and my sweat.

220
00:17:25,844 --> 00:17:27,368
What good would
your time be here

221
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:31,041
if you're not willing to help
the next kid get his chance?

222
00:17:32,584 --> 00:17:34,074
A kid like you.

223
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,055
He's got talent, Jim.

224
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:44,826
Maybe even your
kind of talent.

225
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:49,692
Didn't mention anything in your
telegram about bringing Jim Brown.

226
00:17:49,768 --> 00:17:52,168
I hope you don't mind signing
a couple hundred autographs.

227
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:54,762
Ha! Jim loves to sign
autographs, don't you?

228
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,808
You know, Jim, I'm a
Syracuse man myself.

229
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,172
Class of '31.

230
00:17:58,243 --> 00:17:59,505
You don't say.

231
00:18:01,947 --> 00:18:04,415
Is that Bill Clark
from Notre Dame?

232
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,709
Yeah,
been here all week.

233
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:10,954
Yeah, not enough he steals Ramsey
right out from under my nose.

234
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:13,753
That's your man
right there, Ernie Davis.

235
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:16,795
11 varsity letters.
Plays baseball, too.

236
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:20,256
In fact, there's not
a sport he doesn't play.

237
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,331
Try it one more time.

238
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,520
Let's see what he does.

239
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:56,492
He's too fast
for these kids.

240
00:18:56,568 --> 00:18:58,035
He's too fast
for anybody.

241
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:17,452
Ben Schwartzwalder.
Head coach, Syracuse University Orangemen.

242
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:18,649
Pleasure to
meet you, sir.

243
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:20,988
Pleasure to
meet you, son.

244
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:23,718
Do you know
why I'm here?

245
00:19:24,129 --> 00:19:26,393
Same reason as
Notre Dame, sir?

246
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:28,763
Yeah, same reason.

247
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:33,362
But don't just take my
word for it. Jim! Jim!

248
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:35,165
I'll be right back.
- Thank you.

249
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,798
There's another fan
who'd like to tell you

250
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:40,072
how much he'd like to
see you come play for us.

251
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:41,373
Jim...
- Brown.

252
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:44,847
2,091 rushing yards,
5.8 yards of carry,

253
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:48,182
132 yards and three
touchdowns in the Cotton Bowl.

254
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:50,684
We lost the Cotton Bowl.

255
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:53,589
But that sweep where you
cut back to the middle?

256
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:56,685
My mama and me watched that game on
a television set in Sears and Roebuck.

257
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:59,026
She's a big fan
of yours, too.

258
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:00,388
Oh!

259
00:20:00,465 --> 00:20:01,693
Is she?

260
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:06,731
Mr. Brown?
I hope you like caramel cake.

261
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:07,931
I do, thank you.

262
00:20:08,006 --> 00:20:09,064
Here you go.

263
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:14,240
I understand you're from
Pennsylvania, Mr. Davis.

264
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,977
What brings you up
here to New York?

265
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,744
I asked him to come.

266
00:20:18,817 --> 00:20:20,910
To help me make up my mind.

267
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:24,583
That's good to have
family like that.

268
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:27,091
You close to your family,
Mr. Schwartzwalder?

269
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:29,753
I have a wife
and two daughters.

270
00:20:30,095 --> 00:20:33,360
And they never ask my
opinion about anything.

271
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:36,124
Seems to work.

272
00:20:39,037 --> 00:20:40,231
Mr. Brown?

273
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:41,329
Yes, sir.

274
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:44,136
Were you the first in your
family to go to college?

275
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:45,870
Yes, sir, I was.

276
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:52,808
And what's it like at
Syracuse for men like us?

277
00:20:57,322 --> 00:20:59,620
It's great.
It's good.

278
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:10,901
I suppose I'd say it's not that
different than a lot of places.

279
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:15,873
This cake is delicious.

280
00:21:19,911 --> 00:21:24,871
I want you to go out. Keep going.
Back. Back. All right.

281
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:28,084
Mr. Brown, I'm not
real big on lacrosse.

282
00:21:28,153 --> 00:21:29,848
Jim.
- Jim.

283
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:32,654
Okay, let's see
what you've got.

284
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:37,227
It's not as easy
as it looks, is it?

285
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,285
I'm all right.

286
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:42,697
You see, lacrosse
isn't just a sport.

287
00:21:42,768 --> 00:21:46,795
The Indians used it to settle
their conflicts and heal the sick.

288
00:21:46,872 --> 00:21:49,898
They also played it as
a preparation for war.

289
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:54,806
Make no mistake, there's
a war in this country,

290
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,940
but for men like us, it's
not on the football field.

291
00:21:58,016 --> 00:22:01,577
So if all you nice folks
are offering the same thing,

292
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:03,120
what makes you different?

293
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:04,177
Well, Syracuse...

294
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:06,247
Not Syracuse. You.

295
00:22:07,092 --> 00:22:09,026
I'm not sure I follow
you, Mr. Davis.

296
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:13,224
My grandson might be spending the
next four years listening to you,

297
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:16,294
learning from you.

298
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:20,298
So, I suppose what I'm
asking, Mr. Schwartzwalder,

299
00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:24,069
is what kind
of man are you?

300
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:29,540
I just want to be the best
player I can be, you know.

301
00:22:29,614 --> 00:22:31,445
I want to be
like you, Jim Brown,

302
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:34,781
first-team All-American
then straight to the NFL,

303
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:38,812
and I need you to tell me exactly
where I gotta be to get there.

304
00:22:39,491 --> 00:22:44,087
Look, if you go to Syracuse,
it's not gonna be easy for you.

305
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:48,463
But Schwartzwalder, he's one of
the best coaches in college ball.

306
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:52,333
Now you're fast,
but he'll make you faster.

307
00:22:52,904 --> 00:22:56,396
You run hard, he'll show
you how to run harder.

308
00:22:57,843 --> 00:23:01,335
And you're good,
but he'll make you better.

309
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:03,781
And if you ever
tell him I said that,

310
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:08,343
I'll jump on the first plane from
Cleveland and come and wring your neck.

311
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:12,089
Now let's get out of here.

312
00:23:12,157 --> 00:23:16,753
Let me tell you something about Jim
and I, we had our differences at times.

313
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:22,300
So whatever he told you about me, I
would take it with a grain of salt.

314
00:23:24,636 --> 00:23:27,264
Even if he said you
were a good coach?

315
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:34,543
Well, in that case, son, I would tell
you that too much salt is bad for you.

316
00:24:01,506 --> 00:24:04,270
Ernie? Ernie Davis?

317
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:06,338
How'd you guess?

318
00:24:06,411 --> 00:24:07,503
Welcome.

319
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:10,377
I'm Lew Andreas, the
athletic director. Come on!

320
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:12,747
I'll give you a tour of the
campus on the way to your dorm.

321
00:24:12,818 --> 00:24:14,513
All right.
- Syracuse has a storied

322
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:16,577
academic tradition, Ernie.
- Really?

323
00:24:16,655 --> 00:24:19,089
Steven Crane attended
the university in 1891

324
00:24:19,157 --> 00:24:21,819
<i>and wrote The Red Badge of Courage...
- Hey, Lew!</i>

325
00:24:21,893 --> 00:24:25,454
Harry! Sorry, I'll be
right back. Right back.

326
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:27,829
Harry.
- How are you?

327
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:18,000
No one from here has ever won,
if that's what you're looking for.

328
00:26:19,711 --> 00:26:22,145
No harm in dreaming,
right, Coach?

329
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:26,248
It's not about winning trophies,
Davis. It's about winning games.

330
00:26:26,318 --> 00:26:28,343
I'll see you at practice.

331
00:26:31,189 --> 00:26:32,918
Get up! Get up!

332
00:26:32,991 --> 00:26:35,824
That was plum awful!
Now, last one runs a lap.

333
00:26:35,894 --> 00:26:37,327
Let's go!

334
00:26:38,563 --> 00:26:39,757
Run a lap.

335
00:26:39,831 --> 00:26:40,991
five, six...

336
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,364
Youmans, you move
like a walrus.

337
00:26:44,903 --> 00:26:47,303
Come on! Like a big,
old elephant walrus!

338
00:26:47,372 --> 00:26:50,307
Gerhard, goose-step.
Make your ancestors proud.

339
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:51,865
Ease up, Davis.

340
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:54,369
What are you smiling at?

341
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:56,971
This fine institution is
giving you three hots and a cot.

342
00:26:57,048 --> 00:26:59,278
I do not intend to let
them waste their money.

343
00:26:59,351 --> 00:27:00,841
Get them up, come on.

344
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:02,045
Right about now,
I bet you're wondering

345
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,883
what happened to that nice
gentleman that visited your house

346
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:06,048
and begged you
to come here, huh?

347
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:08,786
Let's go! Now make
no mistake, gentlemen.

348
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:13,559
No matter what anyone else tells you,
you are not here to just play football.

349
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:15,497
You are offside.

350
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:18,001
You are here at
Syracuse to win games.

351
00:27:18,069 --> 00:27:22,165
And you can't win games if you
can't out-perform the other team.

352
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,935
Don't you step on
my All-Americans.

353
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:26,534
If you step on my All-Americans,
I will reach down your throat,

354
00:27:26,611 --> 00:27:29,273
grab your donuts and
tie them to your tonsils!

355
00:27:29,347 --> 00:27:30,473
Good hit!

356
00:27:30,548 --> 00:27:31,537
Take him down!

357
00:27:31,616 --> 00:27:33,846
So, you're the
next Jim Brown, huh?

358
00:27:34,185 --> 00:27:35,516
Yeah, I can see
the resemblance.

359
00:27:35,587 --> 00:27:38,249
Yeah, except Brown was
always mad about something.

360
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:40,587
Don't be fooled
by the smile.

361
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:41,990
Well, he's funnier
than Jimmy.

362
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,084
Yeah.

363
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:46,221
Well, maybe he can entertain us.
You dance, Davis?

364
00:27:46,297 --> 00:27:48,060
Not as good
as me, Lundy.

365
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:50,829
Come on! Get up!
Move! Move! Move! Move!

366
00:27:50,902 --> 00:27:53,200
You should know,
you never call Coach, "Sarge."

367
00:27:53,271 --> 00:27:56,570
He was a captain, jumped out of
airplanes, stormed a bridge in Normandy.

368
00:27:56,641 --> 00:27:58,768
Killed people,
won medals.

369
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:01,243
By the way, I'm Gerhard
Schwedes, halfback.

370
00:28:01,312 --> 00:28:04,145
Roger, everybody calls
me Hound Dog though.

371
00:28:04,215 --> 00:28:06,240
Maury Youmans, center.

372
00:28:06,317 --> 00:28:09,286
I'll be keeping your
jersey clean next year.

373
00:28:09,888 --> 00:28:12,584
He embarrassed you!
Embarrassed you!

374
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:16,092
I want you to move Davis
from freshman to varsity.

375
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:18,891
But he won't be eligible
to play in any games, Ben.

376
00:28:18,963 --> 00:28:21,124
Why don't we just let him catch
his stride with the other freshmen?

377
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:23,633
First, when he does
become eligible next year,

378
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:25,465
I want him to hit
the ground running.

379
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:28,472
Second, he's gonna
raise everybody's game.

380
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,804
He'll probably be the best
running back they face all year.

381
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:31,864
I got you.

382
00:28:31,943 --> 00:28:34,377
Third, that's just
the way I want it done.

383
00:28:36,614 --> 00:28:39,879
Jack Buckley, right tackle,
sophomore. Call me JB.

384
00:28:40,819 --> 00:28:43,583
I was a defensive end
in high school. Philly.

385
00:28:43,655 --> 00:28:46,283
But I think they're
gonna move me to tackle.

386
00:28:46,357 --> 00:28:48,552
What we up to?
Three miles?

387
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:50,253
Don't know.
Never count.

388
00:28:50,328 --> 00:28:51,795
You hear a train?

389
00:28:51,863 --> 00:28:53,262
Why?
Is it making you nervous?

390
00:28:53,331 --> 00:28:55,595
No, I'm not nervous.

391
00:28:56,201 --> 00:28:57,725
Can we get off
these tracks?

392
00:28:57,802 --> 00:28:59,929
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I'm just used to it.

393
00:29:00,004 --> 00:29:01,972
And when you use your meal
voucher in the student union...

394
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,837
Right.
- ...stay away from the meatloaf.

395
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:05,569
What else?
- Girls.

396
00:29:05,643 --> 00:29:09,443
You'll find a Negro polar bear
before you find a Negro coed.

397
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:13,642
Good morning, sir.
Beautiful day, isn't it?

398
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:19,117
I swear, sometimes you feel
like you're on the moon here.

399
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:23,522
Yes, yes,
that's her sister.

400
00:29:24,562 --> 00:29:26,427
Sarette, what did Petey
say about that broad?

401
00:29:26,498 --> 00:29:28,659
Yeah, it's her
little sister.

402
00:29:28,733 --> 00:29:32,430
I don't know about our team yet,
but theirs is in mid-season form.

403
00:29:32,504 --> 00:29:34,472
At least her sister is.

404
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:53,423
Coach
wanted to see me?

405
00:29:53,491 --> 00:29:54,924
He's in his office.

406
00:29:57,095 --> 00:29:58,289
Knock.

407
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:12,302
You wanted to
see me, Coach?

408
00:30:12,944 --> 00:30:14,206
Mmm-hmm.

409
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:16,873
Davis, my system
is simple.

410
00:30:17,348 --> 00:30:19,077
Conditioning,
teamwork.

411
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:22,142
And on my team, I expect every
player to know his job.

412
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,983
Know his place on the field.

413
00:30:24,055 --> 00:30:26,922
Quarterback, running back, lineman.

414
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:30,625
That way, nobody
steps on anybody's toes.

415
00:30:31,763 --> 00:30:33,993
Same holds true
off the field.

416
00:30:34,632 --> 00:30:36,361
I'm not sure how
you mean, Coach.

417
00:30:36,434 --> 00:30:37,423
Well...

418
00:30:38,937 --> 00:30:42,373
There are some lines that some
people don't care to see crossed,

419
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:45,273
just like there are some toes
that shouldn't be stepped on.

420
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:49,006
And I expect my players
not to cross those lines.

421
00:30:52,784 --> 00:30:57,312
Now, you must have a
girlfriend back home, right?

422
00:30:57,388 --> 00:30:59,618
Good-looking
fellow like you.

423
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:02,825
You might want to
keep in touch with her.

424
00:31:06,064 --> 00:31:10,398
You're a smart kid, Davis.
I don't have to spell it out for you, do I?

425
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,167
Anything else, Coach?

426
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,898
No.

427
00:31:16,975 --> 00:31:17,964
May I go now?

428
00:31:20,845 --> 00:31:21,937
Yes.

429
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:31,215
We call that,
"The white girl speech,"

430
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:32,847
and don't worry,
we all get it.

431
00:31:32,924 --> 00:31:35,916
That's funny. I don't remember seeing
that in the campus brochure, JB.

432
00:31:37,095 --> 00:31:38,460
Avatus Stone.

433
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:39,518
Avatus what?

434
00:31:39,831 --> 00:31:42,265
Avatus Stone.
Quarterback. Negro.

435
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:44,460
First one Schwartzwalder
recruited here.

436
00:31:44,535 --> 00:31:45,729
What happened to him?

437
00:31:45,803 --> 00:31:46,963
He got run off.

438
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:48,437
What do you mean,
"Run off?"

439
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:50,906
One night, just
disappeared. Gone.

440
00:31:50,975 --> 00:31:52,704
And then Jimmy
Brown shows up,

441
00:31:52,777 --> 00:31:54,870
and all Jim hears is,
"Don't be like Avatus Stone.

442
00:31:54,946 --> 00:31:56,538
"Whatever you do, don't
be like Avatus Stone."

443
00:31:56,614 --> 00:31:59,174
Wait. But what did he do?
Did he kill somebody?

444
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,878
Worse. He dated
a white girl.

445
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,381
Majorette, blonde.

446
00:32:04,622 --> 00:32:08,786
Schwartzwalder wouldn't even give Jim
a scholarship until sophomore year.

447
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,088
Made him prove himself.

448
00:32:10,161 --> 00:32:11,321
Yeah.

449
00:32:11,396 --> 00:32:15,628
Just goes to show, Coach likes
winning more than he dislikes Negroes.

450
00:32:15,867 --> 00:32:16,925
A little.

451
00:32:17,001 --> 00:32:18,229
See you
at the room.

452
00:32:40,158 --> 00:32:41,182
Hey.

453
00:32:48,933 --> 00:32:50,730
Excuse me,
Hound Dog.

454
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:07,450
Would you look
at that, boys?

455
00:33:07,518 --> 00:33:11,818
If it isn't enough they let a
freshman dress in the varsity locker,

456
00:33:11,889 --> 00:33:13,982
now they went and anointed him
the second coming of Jim Brown.

457
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:16,683
What's your
problem, Lundy?

458
00:33:16,761 --> 00:33:19,594
My problem is I was raised to believe
you should have to earn things.

459
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,598
That's not all you were
raised to believe, now was it?

460
00:33:23,901 --> 00:33:25,198
You got a big mouth, JB.

461
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:26,497
Yeah, I do.

462
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,198
How about
the next play, Ben?

463
00:33:31,275 --> 00:33:34,301
This'll be strong load
right, 42 shovel pass.

464
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,675
We can use
this third short.

465
00:33:38,883 --> 00:33:41,044
Strong load right.
- Right, 42 shovel pass.

466
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:42,882
What you got there, Davis?

467
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:47,449
It's this jersey, Coach.

468
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:49,789
What, something
wrong with it?

469
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:50,850
Yeah, I...

470
00:33:50,928 --> 00:33:53,055
What is it?
Too big? Too tight, what?

471
00:33:53,131 --> 00:33:54,155
Oh, no. Not at all. It's just...

472
00:33:54,232 --> 00:33:56,393
Then what is it?

473
00:33:56,768 --> 00:33:58,736
Somebody made
a mistake.

474
00:33:59,404 --> 00:34:01,668
They gave me
the wrong number.

475
00:34:02,573 --> 00:34:05,565
Mr. Davis, I put that
jersey in your locker.

476
00:34:05,643 --> 00:34:07,508
Are you accusing me
of making a mistake?

477
00:34:07,578 --> 00:34:09,569
No, sir.
- Well then, what?

478
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:14,140
Coach, I'm...

479
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:18,215
I'm not Jim Brown.

480
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:21,449
God, I hope not!

481
00:34:23,528 --> 00:34:25,462
And, God, I hope so.

482
00:34:26,097 --> 00:34:27,997
That is your number.

483
00:34:28,433 --> 00:34:32,597
The day you're not up to it,
I'll take it away as quick as a hiccup.

484
00:34:33,304 --> 00:34:35,169
Now, get out of here.

485
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:42,110
Tight right, 34 right dig.
On one. On one. Ready.

486
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:43,238
Break!

487
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:46,679
Offense, I want to see
you fire off the ball.

488
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:48,582
Fire off the ball.

489
00:34:48,686 --> 00:34:49,675
Red?
- Sir!

490
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,745
Are you in
or out there?

491
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:55,483
Strong left,
strong left!

492
00:34:55,993 --> 00:34:57,790
Strong left. Why don't you
watch the sweep, right there?

493
00:34:57,862 --> 00:34:59,261
Sir!
- Ready?

494
00:35:00,164 --> 00:35:01,324
On one.

495
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:12,174
God damn it!

496
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:19,008
Lundy, you got
yourself planted.

497
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:22,883
Get off your heels and get after it.
That was embarrassing.

498
00:35:25,423 --> 00:35:26,412
Davis looks good.

499
00:35:26,491 --> 00:35:27,981
Looks good, Ben.

500
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:31,591
Five, three,
cover two. Ready?

501
00:35:31,662 --> 00:35:32,890
Break!

502
00:35:34,031 --> 00:35:38,127
Double tight, double tight.
Watch the sweep left! Watch the sweep!

503
00:36:00,591 --> 00:36:02,286
That was a cheap shot.

504
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:05,796
Oh, he's gonna get a lot worse
than that before he's done here.

505
00:36:05,863 --> 00:36:08,263
You've got something to say, 44?

506
00:36:14,438 --> 00:36:15,996
You all right?
- Yeah.

507
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:19,769
You can't let him treat you
like that and not say nothing.

508
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:22,904
That's all right. I do
my talking on the field.

509
00:37:13,631 --> 00:37:15,189
Hey, hey! Come on!

510
00:37:15,266 --> 00:37:16,733
Hey, come on!

511
00:37:18,336 --> 00:37:21,772
All right, all right, all
right, all right, all right.

512
00:37:26,143 --> 00:37:27,770
Don't ever make me
look bad again.

513
00:37:27,845 --> 00:37:29,938
Back to the huddle, Lundy.

514
00:37:30,014 --> 00:37:33,711
You got away with a lot back in high school
'cause you were bigger than everybody else.

515
00:37:33,784 --> 00:37:35,649
Those days are done.

516
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,779
You got it?
- Got it, Coach.

517
00:37:39,323 --> 00:37:40,722
Good block.

518
00:37:41,659 --> 00:37:43,149
Now listen up.

519
00:37:43,828 --> 00:37:47,195
If you practice half-assed,
you will play half-assed.

520
00:37:47,665 --> 00:37:49,656
Now, we have Boston
College in two weeks

521
00:37:49,734 --> 00:37:53,329
and I would like not to get
blown out in our own stadium.

522
00:37:55,706 --> 00:37:57,367
Now play football.

523
00:37:58,209 --> 00:37:59,870
Let's go. Good work.

524
00:38:18,029 --> 00:38:20,293
Surprise, surprise.
Will you look at this?

525
00:38:20,364 --> 00:38:22,628
They're saying Pete Dawkins
is gonna take home the Heisman.

526
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:26,796
Well, he rushed for over 1,000 yards, and
has almost as many receiving yards, JB.

527
00:38:26,871 --> 00:38:28,236
He's gotta
be real good.

528
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,968
Yeah, well, he's
definitely real white.

529
00:38:33,511 --> 00:38:35,877
This thing's
like a love letter.

530
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:40,507
JB, look.

531
00:38:40,584 --> 00:38:41,573
What?

532
00:38:43,688 --> 00:38:44,677
Hey!

533
00:38:45,022 --> 00:38:46,683
Negro polar bears.

534
00:38:47,925 --> 00:38:50,189
Who knew they
traveled in pairs?

535
00:38:52,563 --> 00:38:54,224
Ready?
- For what?

536
00:38:54,298 --> 00:38:57,290
You're not ready. Come on,
let's go. Which one do you like?

537
00:38:57,368 --> 00:38:58,665
Which one do you like?

538
00:38:58,736 --> 00:39:00,135
The one on the right.

539
00:39:00,204 --> 00:39:01,330
Good evening, ladies.

540
00:39:01,405 --> 00:39:02,429
Good evening.

541
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:04,098
I'd like a Pepsi.
- The same.

542
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:05,972
And could you bring us
some of those deviled eggs?

543
00:39:06,043 --> 00:39:08,841
You don't even be
eating no deviled egg.

544
00:39:10,614 --> 00:39:12,514
I'm so sorry.
- You go to Syracuse?

545
00:39:12,583 --> 00:39:14,210
I didn't know.

546
00:39:14,752 --> 00:39:16,515
Yes, we go to Syracuse,
but if you'd like,

547
00:39:16,587 --> 00:39:19,818
we can jump in the kitchen, whip
you up some grits and gravy, ma'am.

548
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:21,289
Get them, Ernie.

549
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,554
I'm Gloria.
This is my friend...

550
00:39:23,627 --> 00:39:24,651
Sarah.

551
00:39:24,729 --> 00:39:26,526
She's visiting
from Cornell.

552
00:39:26,597 --> 00:39:30,761
Gloria and Sarah. Okay.
I'm Jack Buckley, but you call me JB.

553
00:39:30,835 --> 00:39:32,097
JB.
- JB.

554
00:39:32,169 --> 00:39:34,160
And this is my
friend, Ernie.

555
00:39:34,238 --> 00:39:35,899
How do you do?

556
00:39:35,973 --> 00:39:36,962
Very well.

557
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:41,403
So, what are you
guys studying?

558
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:44,681
Well, a little bit
of everything.

559
00:39:44,749 --> 00:39:46,649
Math, basic literature...

560
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:48,082
We're on the
football team.

561
00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:49,414
And that.

562
00:39:50,521 --> 00:39:51,579
Oh!

563
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,824
I don't really know
too much about football.

564
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:56,792
Neither does he.

565
00:39:58,696 --> 00:40:01,961
All kidding aside, Gloria,
would you care to dance?

566
00:40:03,701 --> 00:40:05,066
All right.

567
00:40:23,454 --> 00:40:25,945
So, Sarah, what
are you studying?

568
00:40:26,023 --> 00:40:29,550
I'm majoring in education,
with a minor in social sciences.

569
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:30,884
Oh!

570
00:40:30,961 --> 00:40:33,293
And you?
What are you studying?

571
00:40:33,798 --> 00:40:36,392
Just some basic courses
right now, some math,

572
00:40:37,334 --> 00:40:38,961
some English.

573
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:41,938
Look, I know what
you're thinking.

574
00:40:42,006 --> 00:40:44,736
That since I'm not here
because of my grades,

575
00:40:44,809 --> 00:40:46,367
or my money,

576
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,674
that I'm not
a serious person.

577
00:40:49,413 --> 00:40:51,108
You're wrong.

578
00:40:51,182 --> 00:40:52,809
So, you know what
I'm thinking, do you?

579
00:40:54,752 --> 00:40:56,447
Fine, Mr. Serious.

580
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:59,816
What am I thinking
right now?

581
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:48,502
<i>Rain still coming down
steadily here at Archbold Stadium.</i>

582
00:41:48,572 --> 00:41:51,006
<i>The last chance
for the Orangemen.</i>

583
00:41:58,716 --> 00:42:01,947
<i>The Orangemen can really use
a little help out there.</i>

584
00:42:02,586 --> 00:42:06,215
<i>Let's hope their recruiting is
better than their running game.</i>

585
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:07,348
Hike!

586
00:42:11,996 --> 00:42:15,796
<i>And for the Syracuse faithful,
there's a sense of disbelief,</i>

587
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:18,994
<i>as Holy Cross has knocked
off the mighty Orangemen.</i>

588
00:42:19,503 --> 00:42:20,902
Let's go, ladies.
Pick it up!

589
00:42:20,971 --> 00:42:22,336
Let's go.
Knees up. Knees up.

590
00:42:22,406 --> 00:42:23,464
Pain is how you learn.

591
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:24,565
Come on!

592
00:42:24,642 --> 00:42:28,510
Gentlemen, it is not okay
to lose to an inferior team,

593
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:30,911
especially on our home turf!

594
00:42:31,248 --> 00:42:35,207
Now, we gave no effort out on that
field tonight, so we should feel it now!

595
00:42:35,286 --> 00:42:37,618
Don't you puke
on my gym floor!

596
00:42:38,989 --> 00:42:41,116
Varsity practice only, Ernie.
You don't have to be here.

597
00:42:41,191 --> 00:42:42,283
I know.

598
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:44,956
I just heard you called
a midnight practice, Coach.

599
00:42:45,029 --> 00:42:46,758
I'm sorry I'm late.

600
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:49,093
Well, go ahead.
Get in there.

601
00:42:49,166 --> 00:42:50,258
Yes, sir.

602
00:42:56,574 --> 00:43:01,637
Gentlemen, do you think you
played good football last year?

603
00:43:01,712 --> 00:43:03,111
Think again.

604
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:07,209
<i>You think you're here just
to wear a varsity jacket</i>

605
00:43:07,284 --> 00:43:09,252
<i>and impress the ladies?</i>

606
00:43:10,287 --> 00:43:11,720
Think again.

607
00:43:12,856 --> 00:43:16,758
<i>If you think you know
what pain is, think again.</i>

608
00:43:28,005 --> 00:43:30,473
This is what pain is for.

609
00:43:31,976 --> 00:43:34,604
Now, does anyone
know the last year

610
00:43:34,678 --> 00:43:37,476
that Syracuse won a
national championship?

611
00:43:38,682 --> 00:43:39,774
Hmm?

612
00:43:40,517 --> 00:43:43,816
You're right.
We've never won one.

613
00:43:44,555 --> 00:43:47,718
You are here to
change all that.

614
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:50,518
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome to the field</i>

615
00:43:50,594 --> 00:43:53,495
<i>your Syracuse
University Orangemen.</i>

616
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:57,400
<i>Welcome to Archbold
Stadium, Syracuse, New York,</i>

617
00:43:57,468 --> 00:44:00,926
<i>where the Orangemen
begin the 1959 campaign.</i>

618
00:44:01,372 --> 00:44:05,832
The expectations for Ben Schwartzwalder
and the Orangemen are enormous.

619
00:44:05,909 --> 00:44:09,174
This is a football team
that could go unbeaten.

620
00:45:06,036 --> 00:45:07,264
Hut one!

621
00:45:09,239 --> 00:45:12,265
On first down, Ernie
Davis gets his first carry

622
00:45:12,342 --> 00:45:14,537
<i>as a member of
the Orangemen.</i>

623
00:45:17,347 --> 00:45:19,315
Welcome to
Syracuse football.

624
00:45:20,584 --> 00:45:23,712
Will... Will, he said
his name on the radio.

625
00:45:23,954 --> 00:45:26,047
Sure did. I heard it.
I heard it, Pops.

626
00:45:26,123 --> 00:45:31,117
<i>Ernie Davis certainly has
some big shoes to fill here today.</i>

627
00:45:31,195 --> 00:45:33,925
<i>And after an unsuccessful
series of downs by the Orangemen,</i>

628
00:45:33,997 --> 00:45:37,057
<i>Kansas takes over on
its own 28-yard line.</i>

629
00:45:37,134 --> 00:45:38,226
Hut!

630
00:45:38,635 --> 00:45:41,695
Let's get after it!
Come on, let's get after it!

631
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:53,073
The receiver is leveled by
veteran linebacker Bobby Lundy.

632
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:55,209
I'm doing your job, 44.

633
00:45:55,285 --> 00:45:56,582
Huddle up!

634
00:45:57,354 --> 00:45:59,788
<i>Ball at the Syracuse
10-yard line.</i>

635
00:45:59,857 --> 00:46:03,054
<i>First down and goal
to go for Kansas.</i>

636
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:06,896
Yes.
- Did he get in?

637
00:46:06,964 --> 00:46:08,955
<i>Did he cross the goal line?</i>

638
00:46:09,032 --> 00:46:11,023
Here's the official signal.

639
00:46:13,637 --> 00:46:14,831
Touchdown, Kansas.

640
00:46:14,905 --> 00:46:16,429
What kind of
pig slop is that?

641
00:46:16,507 --> 00:46:18,634
We haven't gotten
a call all day!

642
00:46:18,709 --> 00:46:21,337
<i>Jayhawks jump
out to a 7-0 lead</i>

643
00:46:21,411 --> 00:46:24,778
<i>here at the very,
very quiet Archbold Stadium.</i>

644
00:46:24,982 --> 00:46:28,975
Here in the second quarter,
Kansas on top of Syracuse, 7-0.

645
00:46:29,052 --> 00:46:30,041
Six regular!
Six regular!

646
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:33,248
<i>The Orange faithful still waiting
for something to cheer about.</i>

647
00:46:33,323 --> 00:46:34,415
Hut one!

648
00:46:36,393 --> 00:46:38,088
<i>Sarette back to pass.</i>

649
00:46:40,364 --> 00:46:42,093
<i>Throwing downfield.</i>

650
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,831
<i>It's complete
to his tight end</i>

651
00:46:44,902 --> 00:46:46,995
<i>down near the
Kansas 30-yard line.</i>

652
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:48,697
Way to pick up
the blitz, Ernie!

653
00:46:48,772 --> 00:46:52,139
A superb block on the play,
turned in by Ernie Davis.

654
00:46:52,543 --> 00:46:55,376
<i>Second down, eight yards
to go for the Orangemen.</i>

655
00:46:55,445 --> 00:46:56,571
Hut!

656
00:46:56,914 --> 00:46:59,439
<i>Toss play once
again to Ernie Davis.</i>

657
00:47:02,286 --> 00:47:03,913
Get him out there!

658
00:47:04,922 --> 00:47:07,015
<i>Davis to the
Kansas secondary.</i>

659
00:47:08,058 --> 00:47:09,650
Go, Davis, go!

660
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:14,255
<i>Look at that young man go!</i>

661
00:47:16,033 --> 00:47:20,299
<i>The Elmira Express virtually
walks into the end zone!</i>

662
00:47:21,138 --> 00:47:25,234
<i>The Syracuse Orangemen,
now on top of Kansas, 14-7.</i>

663
00:47:25,309 --> 00:47:26,640
Go for one.

664
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:31,170
<i>And what an impression Ernie Davis has
made on this crowd here at Archbold.</i>

665
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:35,709
<i>The Orangemen just may have
found their next great halfback.</i>

666
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:47,755
Hey, Ernie.

667
00:47:47,831 --> 00:47:49,662
Hey, fellas,
how you doing?

668
00:47:50,267 --> 00:47:52,292
You guys
coming or going?

669
00:47:52,636 --> 00:47:54,570
Hey. Welcome home, Ernie.

670
00:47:54,638 --> 00:47:55,662
Pops!

671
00:47:55,739 --> 00:47:57,001
They give you
some time off?

672
00:47:57,074 --> 00:47:59,008
Yeah, yeah,
long weekend.

673
00:47:59,076 --> 00:48:01,237
Look at you,
all college boy.

674
00:48:01,311 --> 00:48:02,869
You're just gonna dirty
up my college jacket.

675
00:48:02,946 --> 00:48:04,811
Come on, come on, let's go inside.
You're too good to hug me?

676
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:05,871
Look at this!

677
00:48:05,949 --> 00:48:07,007
Let me carry that.
Give me your bag.

678
00:48:07,084 --> 00:48:09,450
If they'd run you more
last week against Navy,

679
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:11,384
you would have blown
them jokers off the field.

680
00:48:11,455 --> 00:48:12,786
Will, we won.

681
00:48:12,856 --> 00:48:14,949
Seems like that coach of
yours like to pass the ball.

682
00:48:15,025 --> 00:48:16,515
I'll get my carries.

683
00:48:16,593 --> 00:48:18,891
Yeah? He promise you that?

684
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:21,393
No. Thank you, ma'am. But eventually...
- No?

685
00:48:21,465 --> 00:48:22,955
How are your
grades, Ernie?

686
00:48:24,968 --> 00:48:26,492
Ernie?

687
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:28,936
They're good, Pops, thanks.
I'm keeping them up.

688
00:48:29,006 --> 00:48:31,406
I like history, and I'm
taking a business course.

689
00:48:31,475 --> 00:48:32,601
That's good.

690
00:48:32,676 --> 00:48:35,736
'Cause football
is just a game.

691
00:48:35,812 --> 00:48:38,542
It's that degree that's
going to count for something.

692
00:48:38,615 --> 00:48:40,776
Gonna get you a good job.

693
00:48:40,851 --> 00:48:43,217
Where you gonna get a good
job at, a Negro with a diploma?

694
00:48:43,287 --> 00:48:45,721
AT&T? GM?

695
00:48:46,223 --> 00:48:48,953
It's football that's
gonna take him someplace.

696
00:48:49,026 --> 00:48:51,358
Otherwise, he gonna be
working right here with us,

697
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:52,725
cutting coal,
and you know it.

698
00:48:52,796 --> 00:48:54,024
I wanna apologize for him.

699
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:55,689
You ain't got to
apologize for me, Pops!

700
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:57,290
Don't you start
it tonight, Will.

701
00:48:57,367 --> 00:48:58,994
Pops... Guys!
-Don't start it tonight.

702
00:48:59,069 --> 00:49:00,366
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

703
00:49:00,871 --> 00:49:02,133
Relax.

704
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:04,039
You're both right.

705
00:49:04,875 --> 00:49:07,969
Now, my plan A is the Cleveland Browns.
Now, if that doesn't work out,

706
00:49:08,045 --> 00:49:10,343
plan B is the
New York Giants.

707
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:15,145
Come on, Ernie.
We don't wanna be late.

708
00:49:16,019 --> 00:49:19,318
Sorry, my dear, we got
things to do, people to meet.

709
00:49:22,259 --> 00:49:24,124
I'll meet you
outside, Ernie.

710
00:49:27,364 --> 00:49:31,494
Jim Crow is alive and
well right here in Pennsylvania.

711
00:49:31,568 --> 00:49:32,592
Yes, it is.

712
00:49:32,669 --> 00:49:35,035
But we can no longer
willfully close our eyes

713
00:49:35,105 --> 00:49:39,474
and pretend that we cannot see
that he sees us as beneath him.

714
00:49:39,543 --> 00:49:41,511
Yes!
- No, we cannot.

715
00:49:41,578 --> 00:49:46,140
And we can no longer stay silent
when he tells us that we cannot speak.

716
00:49:46,216 --> 00:49:47,649
Yes!
- That's right!

717
00:49:47,718 --> 00:49:50,710
Abraham Lincoln stood
in a field at Gettysburg,

718
00:49:50,787 --> 00:49:52,755
and spoke of a new nation.
- That's right.

719
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:57,692
Uniontown is 100 miles away
from his Gettysburg.

720
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:01,157
We are still
yet to be equal.

721
00:50:01,231 --> 00:50:07,727
That is why the NAACP is calling for
a nationwide boycott of Woolworths.

722
00:50:08,238 --> 00:50:09,262
That's right!
That's right!

723
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:10,966
All right.

724
00:50:11,708 --> 00:50:12,970
Come on.

725
00:50:14,644 --> 00:50:20,378
Boycott! Boycott!
Boycott! Boycott! Boycott! Boycott!

726
00:50:20,450 --> 00:50:22,111
Come to Washington
with us.

727
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:24,312
There's a bus going
down from the church.

728
00:50:24,388 --> 00:50:26,151
We gonna organize
with Martin Luther King

729
00:50:26,223 --> 00:50:29,351
and let the people know this
country has got to change.

730
00:50:29,426 --> 00:50:31,724
I don't think I can be a part of
what you want me to be a part of

731
00:50:31,795 --> 00:50:33,888
right now, Will.
All this.

732
00:50:33,964 --> 00:50:35,431
What you saying?

733
00:50:35,499 --> 00:50:36,830
I got a scholarship.

734
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:40,666
I can't risk losing it, and
I don't wanna invite trouble.

735
00:50:40,737 --> 00:50:43,729
I see. Did Emmett Till invite trouble?
Did Rosa Parks?

736
00:50:43,807 --> 00:50:45,069
Who told you this,
your coach?

737
00:50:45,142 --> 00:50:46,336
You don't understand.

738
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:48,037
It's a different
world up there.

739
00:50:48,111 --> 00:50:49,203
Is it?

740
00:50:49,446 --> 00:50:51,311
You know, your coach
sound a lot like Pops.

741
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:54,782
No understanding whatsoever with
the troubles in this country.

742
00:50:54,851 --> 00:50:57,411
"You boys got no business north
of Union Street, you hear me?"

743
00:50:57,487 --> 00:50:58,613
Now, leave Pops
out of this, Will.

744
00:50:58,688 --> 00:51:01,020
Now you got a white man telling
you what you can and can't do.

745
00:51:01,091 --> 00:51:02,285
Wait a minute. Hold on.
Watch how you talk to me.

746
00:51:02,359 --> 00:51:03,621
That man don't care
nothing about you, Ernie.

747
00:51:03,693 --> 00:51:04,625
You're not there.
You don't know him.

748
00:51:04,694 --> 00:51:06,025
You just his educated nigger.

749
00:51:06,096 --> 00:51:08,064
You don't know what you're talking about.
- Tom can toe the line

750
00:51:08,131 --> 00:51:12,192
and carry the ball, but that man
will turn on you. Just you wait.

751
00:51:13,804 --> 00:51:17,763
You don't think I'm reminded
every minute of who I am at school?

752
00:51:17,841 --> 00:51:21,937
Everybody there is watching me, and
waiting for me to make a mistake.

753
00:51:22,813 --> 00:51:24,440
You Ernie Davis.

754
00:51:25,215 --> 00:51:27,649
You got your
name in the paper.

755
00:51:27,717 --> 00:51:30,982
Now that's something for colored folk
around here to open up a newspaper, Ernie,

756
00:51:31,054 --> 00:51:33,989
and see your name,
your face.

757
00:51:35,692 --> 00:51:39,458
And say, "I know him.
I went to school with him."

758
00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:42,428
They gonna be
looking up to you.

759
00:51:42,499 --> 00:51:46,060
I think you owe them more
than just running a ball.

760
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:03,084
The play action
pass was there all day.

761
00:52:03,153 --> 00:52:04,848
It won't be
there the next time.

762
00:52:04,921 --> 00:52:06,115
Why not?

763
00:52:06,189 --> 00:52:10,250
'Cause Boston College is watching
the same damn game that we are.

764
00:52:37,254 --> 00:52:41,486
All right, we start out double
tight. Tight in here, tight in there.

765
00:52:41,558 --> 00:52:42,820
Just a normal
double tight.

766
00:52:42,893 --> 00:52:45,157
Just like from the
beginning of time, Simmy.

767
00:52:45,228 --> 00:52:48,493
Now, we're gonna take Schwedes
out of the wing position,

768
00:52:48,565 --> 00:52:51,295
and we're gonna move him
into a three-back formation.

769
00:52:51,368 --> 00:52:53,666
Only shift it over like this.

770
00:52:53,737 --> 00:52:56,797
All right, defense. What
do you do when you see this?

771
00:52:56,873 --> 00:52:58,738
Now the defense,
they have to shift.

772
00:52:58,808 --> 00:52:59,866
We move to the right.

773
00:52:59,943 --> 00:53:03,401
That's right. Even if it's shading
from nose up to opposite shoulder.

774
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:06,415
Our right tackle?
He goes on the left side.

775
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:08,742
I'm gonna leave the huddle,

776
00:53:08,818 --> 00:53:12,151
and you're gonna start out
right, just like normal.

777
00:53:14,991 --> 00:53:16,015
Go left, go left!

778
00:53:16,092 --> 00:53:18,151
<i>Except before we're set,
you're gonna run left.</i>

779
00:53:18,228 --> 00:53:19,252
He runs left,

780
00:53:19,329 --> 00:53:21,297
and you're gonna line
up on the left side.

781
00:53:21,364 --> 00:53:22,763
And he sets up
on the left side.

782
00:53:25,302 --> 00:53:28,032
And it's evident that
Boston College is confused

783
00:53:28,104 --> 00:53:30,231
by the offense
Syracuse is running.

784
00:53:30,307 --> 00:53:32,537
You lost me, Ben.
The right tackle moves to the left,

785
00:53:32,609 --> 00:53:33,837
he covers the tight end.

786
00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:36,572
But if he's on the left side, we cover
the tight end, I can't pass to him.

787
00:53:36,646 --> 00:53:40,480
The Holy Cross defenders are
desperately trying to position themselves

788
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:42,347
<i>to best play against
this formation.</i>

789
00:53:42,419 --> 00:53:44,387
Petey, am I talking
French here?

790
00:53:44,454 --> 00:53:47,946
Tackle lines up inside
the tight end, does he not?

791
00:53:48,024 --> 00:53:50,083
It's unbalanced, right?
Do we shift again, Coach?

792
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:51,787
Yes, they shift.
They all shift.

793
00:53:51,861 --> 00:53:54,056
They have to shift.
They must shift.

794
00:53:54,130 --> 00:53:56,223
Shift, shift, shift.

795
00:53:56,299 --> 00:53:58,494
All right, so you've got
everybody and their dog

796
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:00,468
shifted over to
the left. Now what?

797
00:54:00,537 --> 00:54:01,799
We are going to run it...

798
00:54:01,871 --> 00:54:03,202
We are going to run it...

799
00:54:03,273 --> 00:54:04,205
...to the right.

800
00:54:04,274 --> 00:54:05,798
...to the right.
- To the right, Coach?

801
00:54:05,875 --> 00:54:07,365
But that's away
from our strength.

802
00:54:07,444 --> 00:54:08,706
The weak side of the field.

803
00:54:08,778 --> 00:54:10,746
So, we're going to
run to the weak side?

804
00:54:10,814 --> 00:54:13,374
I like the way that
you think, Mr. Davis.

805
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:17,648
Gentlemen, when you have a thoroughbred,
you do not lock him in the barn.

806
00:54:17,721 --> 00:54:19,120
Hut!

807
00:54:23,326 --> 00:54:26,352
I will take one-on-one
out here all day long.

808
00:54:46,082 --> 00:54:48,141
That just might
work, Coach.

809
00:54:48,585 --> 00:54:49,711
Damn right.

810
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:56,055
"Ernie Davis is a bull-necked,
steel-shouldered running back

811
00:54:56,126 --> 00:55:00,256
"from Syracuse University, who
can run a football field's length

812
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:01,661
"in 10 seconds flat."
- 10 seconds?

813
00:55:01,731 --> 00:55:02,993
Okay, put that
away now, please.

814
00:55:03,066 --> 00:55:04,192
Don't you be modest.

815
00:55:04,267 --> 00:55:05,461
Thank you.
- Be proud, Ernie.

816
00:55:05,535 --> 00:55:07,765
You're in the same
magazine as Reverend King,

817
00:55:07,837 --> 00:55:09,031
that's something.
- Yeah.

818
00:55:09,105 --> 00:55:12,768
That is something, but Sarah, it looks
like you didn't read the best part.

819
00:55:12,842 --> 00:55:16,835
"In his spare time, the bull-necked
Ernie Davis enjoys sewing,

820
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:20,374
"baking lasagna, and writing
songs for his church choir."

821
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:22,384
Ernie, you never invite me to church.
- Very funny, very funny.

822
00:55:22,452 --> 00:55:24,511
I'm hurt. What is that?
- Ernie? Ernie.

823
00:55:24,587 --> 00:55:27,112
Can I have a word
with you, please?

824
00:55:28,291 --> 00:55:29,883
Make me some lasagna.

825
00:55:32,429 --> 00:55:33,794
He can take it.

826
00:55:33,863 --> 00:55:35,694
Good to see you.
- That's Mr. Andreas.

827
00:55:35,765 --> 00:55:37,255
Just turn left there.

828
00:55:49,145 --> 00:55:51,773
"He maketh me to
lie down in green pastures.

829
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:54,817

"I will fear no evil,

834
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:10,124
"Thy rod and thy staff..."

835
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:12,862
40 years, Pops worked underground.

836
00:56:14,237 --> 00:56:17,172
Seems wrong to put him
right back in there.

837
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:12,486
<i>And the drive deep into
left field. And it's a home run!</i>

838
00:57:31,981 --> 00:57:35,246
"And his grace which was
bestowed upon me was not in vain."

839
00:57:35,318 --> 00:57:38,082
<i>"His grace
which was bestowed..."</i>

840
00:57:38,154 --> 00:57:41,681
<i>"... upon me
was not in vain."</i>

841
00:57:58,041 --> 00:57:59,167
Pops.

842
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:04,838
Now, we barely got by West Virginia
when we played them here last year,

843
00:58:04,914 --> 00:58:08,372
and they've been licking their
chops waiting for us ever since.

844
00:58:08,451 --> 00:58:11,215
They play by a
different set of rules.

845
00:58:11,588 --> 00:58:13,419
It will be hostile.

846
00:58:14,224 --> 00:58:16,454
Their fans are unruly,

847
00:58:16,759 --> 00:58:19,887
especially when they're
playing against a team that

848
00:58:19,963 --> 00:58:22,625
looks a little
different than they do.

849
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:25,657
Now, load up.

850
00:58:40,383 --> 00:58:41,782
God damn it!

851
00:58:42,151 --> 00:58:44,210
Hey, Squirrel!

852
00:58:44,287 --> 00:58:46,812
Didn't I tell you to
put new laces in these?

853
00:58:46,890 --> 00:58:49,085
I forgot. I'll do it now.

854
00:58:49,158 --> 00:58:50,887
His name is Donald.

855
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:52,350
What?

856
00:58:52,428 --> 00:58:54,828
His name is Donald.

857
00:58:58,701 --> 00:59:01,795
Hell, Squirrel,
I don't know which one's worse.

858
00:59:02,105 --> 00:59:07,270
But you see, Davis, around here,
Squirrel finishes the laces.

859
00:59:07,777 --> 00:59:11,042
If it makes you happy,
you can shine them for me.

860
00:59:12,248 --> 00:59:13,715
Hey, come on!

861
00:59:18,421 --> 00:59:19,854
Get him off!

862
00:59:20,523 --> 00:59:22,991
Hey! Knock it off!

863
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:24,959
Hey!

864
00:59:25,628 --> 00:59:28,028
What the hell's
going on in here?

865
00:59:31,501 --> 00:59:33,765
Where are you going,
Davis? Davis!

866
00:59:33,836 --> 00:59:35,394
I'm talking to you!

867
00:59:35,471 --> 00:59:38,702
Hey, you guys all saw it.
Coach, he went crazy on me.

868
00:59:43,646 --> 00:59:45,546
All right,
everyone, listen up.

869
00:59:45,615 --> 00:59:47,913
Everyone is to keep their
helmet on at all times,

870
00:59:47,984 --> 00:59:49,849
whether you're in
the game or not.

871
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:52,649
I don't want anyone
hurt by flying bottles.

872
00:59:52,722 --> 00:59:56,021
Davis, Buckley, Baker, you
stay in the middle of the pack.

873
00:59:56,092 --> 00:59:57,354
Keep your heads down.

874
00:59:57,427 --> 01:00:00,988
It must be Halloween,
'cause here come the spooks!

875
01:00:01,064 --> 01:00:03,225
We'll be safer
out on the field.

876
01:00:03,299 --> 01:00:04,425
All right, let's go!

877
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:05,865
Come on, boys!
Let's go!

878
01:00:05,935 --> 01:00:08,165
<i>The unbeaten
Syracuse Orangemen</i>

879
01:00:08,237 --> 01:00:11,138
<i>have made the journey
to Morgantown, West Virginia.</i>

880
01:00:11,207 --> 01:00:14,108
<i>They'll face a rugged
Mountaineer team.</i>

881
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:39,830
<i>And there's the boot. Baker
takes the football up to the 20,</i>

882
01:00:40,236 --> 01:00:45,435
the 30, the 40 and he's finally
brought down at the 47-yard line.

883
01:00:45,508 --> 01:00:47,533
Offense, let's go.
- Look alive, let's go.

884
01:00:47,610 --> 01:00:51,376
A full house. 495 dive
on two, on two. Ready?

885
01:00:51,447 --> 01:00:53,642
Thirty-five,
thirty-five!

886
01:00:54,417 --> 01:00:55,941
Okie. Okie.

887
01:00:57,553 --> 01:00:59,248
Thirty-five,
thirty-five.

888
01:00:59,322 --> 01:01:01,620
<i>The Orangemen break the
huddle, first and 10.</i>

889
01:01:01,691 --> 01:01:04,455
<i>Out of the full-house
backfield.</i>

890
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:09,992
<i>The give is to Ernie Davis.
Davis spins at the line of scrimmage</i>

891
01:01:10,066 --> 01:01:13,627
<i>where he's met by a host
of West Virginia tacklers.</i>

892
01:01:16,639 --> 01:01:19,005
Get him off him!
Play football!

893
01:01:22,545 --> 01:01:23,944
Huddle up, 70.

894
01:01:24,013 --> 01:01:26,777
We will get no justice
from the refs tonight.

895
01:01:26,849 --> 01:01:29,249
All right, guys. We're gonna
run it till they stop it.

896
01:01:29,318 --> 01:01:31,809
Right, full house. 495
dive, on one, on one. Ready?

897
01:01:31,888 --> 01:01:33,412
Break!
- Break!

898
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:39,025
Same play! Same play! Same hole.
Run it. Same play, same hole, on one.

899
01:01:39,595 --> 01:01:40,926
Run it.
- Strong left!

900
01:01:40,997 --> 01:01:42,362
Thanks.
- Set!

901
01:01:43,666 --> 01:01:45,930
<i>Second down at
six yards to go.</i>

902
01:01:46,002 --> 01:01:47,026
Hut one!

903
01:01:47,103 --> 01:01:51,904
<i>The Orangemen go back to Ernie Davis.
Davis is met with a wall of Mountaineers.</i>

904
01:01:53,242 --> 01:01:56,575
And Davis reverses field
with a tremendous move.

905
01:01:56,646 --> 01:01:58,238
What's he doing?

906
01:02:07,957 --> 01:02:09,925
<i>Davis picks up a big block</i>

907
01:02:10,059 --> 01:02:13,995
<i>and with a stiff arm, gets free
into West Virginia territory.</i>

908
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:19,295
Shit, he's going in.

909
01:02:20,803 --> 01:02:24,899
He's at the 20,
the 10, inside the 5!

910
01:02:29,779 --> 01:02:31,576
No! Knee down, right here.

911
01:02:31,647 --> 01:02:34,013
It certainly appeared
from our vantage point here

912
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:36,916
that Ernie Davis has
scored on this play.

913
01:02:36,986 --> 01:02:38,248
I got you
down at the 1.

914
01:02:38,321 --> 01:02:39,310
You were down!

915
01:02:39,388 --> 01:02:40,616
No, I got in,
Mr. Official.

916
01:02:40,690 --> 01:02:41,679
Sir, I got in.
You saw me...

917
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:42,918
You want a
penalty, boy?

918
01:02:42,992 --> 01:02:45,119
Get back in
that huddle now.

919
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:47,957
Brokaw, come here!
- Yes, Coach.

920
01:02:48,030 --> 01:02:49,793
Come on, son.
Go get us six. Go!

921
01:02:49,866 --> 01:02:52,562
Davis, come in!
Come in, son. Come in.

922
01:02:53,336 --> 01:02:55,133
Come on, son. Let's go.
- For me?

923
01:02:55,204 --> 01:02:56,466
You're holding up the game. Let's go.
- I got it.

924
01:02:56,539 --> 01:02:58,302
<i>First down Syracuse.</i>

925
01:03:07,383 --> 01:03:10,409
Why'd you pull me, Coach?
I took it down there. Let me score.

926
01:03:10,486 --> 01:03:12,545
If I let you carry that
ball across the goal line,

927
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:16,251
all of us, we might not get
back on that bus in one piece.

928
01:03:16,726 --> 01:03:19,490
That's the way they
do things down here.

929
01:03:20,763 --> 01:03:22,754
<i>Sarette hands off to Brokaw,</i>

930
01:03:22,832 --> 01:03:24,595
<i>who punches the ball home,</i>

931
01:03:24,667 --> 01:03:27,602
<i>and the Orangemen
have grabbed a 6-0 lead</i>

932
01:03:27,670 --> 01:03:30,798
<i>against the Mountaineers
on their own home turf.</i>

933
01:03:32,575 --> 01:03:33,633
Go home, blackie!

934
01:03:34,510 --> 01:03:39,413
<i>First down for the Orangemen.
Ball at the West Virginia 42-yard line.</i>

935
01:03:41,517 --> 01:03:42,643
<i>Sarette with the fake.</i>

936
01:03:42,718 --> 01:03:47,553
<i>Ernie Davis across the left side breaks
the tackle and gets into the open field.</i>

937
01:03:55,398 --> 01:03:57,332
Good run! Good run!

938
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:59,391
Brokaw, come here.
- Yeah, Coach.

939
01:03:59,468 --> 01:04:02,164
Strong right, fullback
wedge eight. Go!

940
01:04:02,238 --> 01:04:03,728
Ernie, Ernie!

941
01:04:06,676 --> 01:04:08,507
Brokaw, get in there!

942
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:11,613
Right full house, 40 broom.
On one, on one. Ready.

943
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:13,114
Break!
- Break!

944
01:04:13,182 --> 01:04:15,309
<i>Davis,
get off the field.</i>

945
01:04:15,384 --> 01:04:18,114
<i>Now, you got a white man telling
you what you can and can't do...</i>

946
01:04:18,187 --> 01:04:20,519
<i>... one hundred years
away from here...</i>

947
01:04:20,590 --> 01:04:21,955
Ref, time out. Time out.

948
01:04:22,024 --> 01:04:23,252
You don't have any more.

949
01:04:23,326 --> 01:04:24,816
<i>We are still not yet...</i>

950
01:04:24,894 --> 01:04:26,122
You're just his
educated nigger.

951
01:04:28,998 --> 01:04:31,364
<i>They gonna be
looking up to you.</i>

952
01:04:32,201 --> 01:04:35,637
I think you owe them more
than just running a ball.

953
01:05:05,835 --> 01:05:07,234
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

954
01:05:07,303 --> 01:05:10,101
What did I tell you
about the rules down here?

955
01:05:10,172 --> 01:05:12,163
What are you... We just scored.
- Bullshit.

956
01:05:12,241 --> 01:05:15,039
You scored! We're a team.
I'm the coach.

957
01:05:15,111 --> 01:05:17,909
You're a goddamn running back.
You're my goddamn running back,

958
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:21,108
and you will do what I tell
you, when I tell you to do it.

959
01:05:21,183 --> 01:05:24,016
Now, you plant your ass
down on that bench.

960
01:05:42,238 --> 01:05:43,865
Am I invisible?

961
01:05:44,307 --> 01:05:46,241
What?
- Am I invisible to you?

962
01:05:46,309 --> 01:05:50,541
Am I an X, an O in your goddamn playbook,
or do you see a person standing here?

963
01:05:50,613 --> 01:05:53,343
Am I Avatus Stone?
Am I Jim Brown?

964
01:05:53,816 --> 01:05:55,249
Just a running back?
That's bullshit!

965
01:05:55,318 --> 01:05:56,683
You're about
this close, Davis.

966
01:05:56,752 --> 01:05:58,117
Come on, let's go.

967
01:05:58,187 --> 01:06:00,519
You know, maybe,
just maybe, Coach,

968
01:06:00,589 --> 01:06:03,057
the rules down here
are your rules, too.

969
01:06:03,125 --> 01:06:04,683
That's enough.
Come on.

970
01:06:38,894 --> 01:06:39,952
What?

971
01:06:41,697 --> 01:06:43,130
You all right?

972
01:06:46,702 --> 01:06:47,760
Yeah.

973
01:06:52,141 --> 01:06:53,506
Good game.

974
01:06:57,747 --> 01:06:59,544
Good game, Ben.
- Mike?

975
01:06:59,615 --> 01:07:00,604
I tried not to
run up the score.

976
01:07:00,683 --> 01:07:03,550
I know. You just had
our number tonight.

977
01:07:03,619 --> 01:07:06,986
Say, Ben, how many coloreds
you got playing for you?

978
01:07:07,056 --> 01:07:08,080
Three, why?

979
01:07:08,157 --> 01:07:10,421
You just be careful, Ben.
They got no discipline.

980
01:07:10,493 --> 01:07:14,122
Too many of them and they'll
take the team away from you.

981
01:07:14,897 --> 01:07:16,592
Now, you give my
best to Reggie.

982
01:07:16,665 --> 01:07:18,098
Coon-lover!

983
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:51,957
Can I sit down?

984
01:08:05,614 --> 01:08:07,707
I'm sorry I lost my temper.

985
01:08:09,819 --> 01:08:13,084
But I'm not sorry I stayed in the
game, and I'm not sorry I scored.

986
01:08:13,155 --> 01:08:15,020
Now, what kind of
an apology is this?

987
01:08:15,091 --> 01:08:18,026
I've never walked off
the field for anybody.

988
01:08:19,862 --> 01:08:22,353
These people down
here, they're dug in.

989
01:08:22,431 --> 01:08:23,693
They're set in their
ways. We got...

990
01:08:23,766 --> 01:08:24,790
Coach, that...

991
01:08:24,867 --> 01:08:26,357
You're just hiding
behind those words.

992
01:08:26,435 --> 01:08:27,925
I have a responsibility
to my team, Davis.

993
01:08:28,003 --> 01:08:29,561
That's not how
it has to be.

994
01:08:29,638 --> 01:08:33,039
Yes. Jack, Art and me,
we're all a part of your team.

995
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:37,743
But we can't run across that
goal line down here without you.

996
01:08:39,748 --> 01:08:43,047
It doesn't mean a damn
thing unless you're with us.

997
01:08:47,022 --> 01:08:48,421
Is that it?

998
01:09:10,412 --> 01:09:12,676
<i>And in college
football, the Syracuse Orangemen</i>

999
01:09:12,748 --> 01:09:16,548
<i>continue their dominance of the
Eastern Conference with a 29-0...</i>

1000
01:09:16,619 --> 01:09:18,644
<i>Fans, I wish
all of you could be here</i>

1001
01:09:18,721 --> 01:09:21,087
<i>to see what these eyes
have just witnessed.</i>

1002
01:09:21,157 --> 01:09:25,355
<i>... brilliant displays of athletic
talent I've seen on any gridiron.</i>

1003
01:09:25,427 --> 01:09:27,588
Come on, guys!
Sustain your block!

1004
01:09:27,663 --> 01:09:30,791
<i>... led by Ernie Davis,
from Elmira, New York.</i>

1005
01:09:30,866 --> 01:09:33,460
<i>Another jaw-dropping
performance here at Navy Memorial Stadium.</i>

1006
01:09:33,536 --> 01:09:36,801
<i>I tell you one
thing, he's electrified this crowd.</i>

1007
01:09:37,740 --> 01:09:40,470
<i>The unbeaten
Syracuse Orangemen...</i>

1008
01:09:40,543 --> 01:09:42,170
<i>Davis,
who has been</i>

1009
01:09:42,244 --> 01:09:46,578
<i>nothing short of brilliant
today, reserves the victory</i>

1010
01:09:46,649 --> 01:09:50,210
<i>for coach Ben Schwartzwalder
and the Syracuse Orangemen.</i>

1011
01:09:50,286 --> 01:09:51,617
<i>... nothing
but a hound dog</i>

1012
01:09:51,687 --> 01:09:52,847
You know it!

1013
01:09:52,922 --> 01:09:55,356
<i>Crying all the time</i>

1014
01:09:56,859 --> 01:10:00,090
<i>Well, you ain't never
caught a rabbit</i>

1015
01:10:00,162 --> 01:10:03,598
<i>And you ain't no
friend of mine</i>

1016
01:10:05,434 --> 01:10:07,129
Settle down.
Listen up, boys.

1017
01:10:07,203 --> 01:10:09,501
All right, listen up.
Listen up!

1018
01:10:09,572 --> 01:10:10,766
Coach!

1019
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:17,077
Gentlemen,
congratulations.

1020
01:10:18,047 --> 01:10:21,073
Undefeated with a number one
ranking is something to be proud of.

1021
01:10:21,150 --> 01:10:22,640
Yeah!

1022
01:10:22,718 --> 01:10:23,707
But...

1023
01:10:24,420 --> 01:10:25,444
But...

1024
01:10:26,355 --> 01:10:28,983
Mr. Andreas
has informed me

1025
01:10:29,425 --> 01:10:32,292
that we have been offered
two different bowl games,

1026
01:10:32,361 --> 01:10:34,386
the Orange Bowl in Miami

1027
01:10:34,930 --> 01:10:37,160
and the Cotton
Bowl in Dallas.

1028
01:10:37,499 --> 01:10:41,458
Now, in Miami, we would play
Georgia, ranked ninth in the polls.

1029
01:10:41,770 --> 01:10:47,436
And in Dallas, we would play Texas,
ranked second, right behind us.

1030
01:10:48,777 --> 01:10:54,272
If we win either game, we
will be the national champions.

1031
01:10:55,117 --> 01:10:58,450
Texas is the tougher
opponent, the tougher team.

1032
01:10:59,321 --> 01:11:03,553
But to be the best, I believe
you have to beat the best.

1033
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:10,591
So, I guess you know how I would
vote, but this is your vote.

1034
01:11:12,034 --> 01:11:15,470
This is your team.
Your decision.

1035
01:11:20,909 --> 01:11:22,069
Texas.

1036
01:11:25,381 --> 01:11:26,871
Texas.

1037
01:11:27,249 --> 01:11:28,773
Texas.

1038
01:11:28,851 --> 01:11:30,182
Texas.

1039
01:11:30,252 --> 01:11:31,446
Texas.
- Texas.

1040
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:32,714
Texas.
- Texas.

1041
01:11:32,788 --> 01:11:33,914
Texas.

1042
01:11:33,989 --> 01:11:35,047
Texas.

1043
01:11:35,124 --> 01:11:36,182
Texas.

1044
01:11:36,325 --> 01:11:38,054
Texas.

1045
01:11:38,127 --> 01:11:40,027
Looking forward to it!
- Texas.

1046
01:11:40,095 --> 01:11:41,323
Texas.
- Texas!

1047
01:11:41,397 --> 01:11:42,955
Texas.
- Texas.

1048
01:11:43,032 --> 01:11:44,192
Texas.

1049
01:11:50,739 --> 01:11:52,604
A lot of people think
the Texas Longhorns

1050
01:11:52,741 --> 01:11:54,606
are the best team
in the nation.

1051
01:11:54,677 --> 01:11:56,406
One big reason is Clay Taylor.

1052
01:11:56,478 --> 01:11:59,038
All-American, best Division
One tackle in the nation

1053
01:11:59,114 --> 01:12:01,309
three years in a row.

1054
01:12:04,353 --> 01:12:08,084
Now, some folks even think that the
only reason that we are undefeated

1055
01:12:08,157 --> 01:12:11,786
is because we have not met
Clay Taylor and his teammates.

1056
01:12:13,495 --> 01:12:17,056
I want everyone to take a good long
look at what we're up against here

1057
01:12:17,132 --> 01:12:20,329
because in Texas,
football is a religion.

1058
01:12:28,243 --> 01:12:30,939
You think we been south?

1059
01:12:31,013 --> 01:12:33,243
We ain't been south
till we go to Texas.

1060
01:12:54,536 --> 01:12:56,094
Schwedes,
give me a goose-step.

1061
01:13:13,822 --> 01:13:17,622
<i>We are now faced
with a far different problem.</i>

1062
01:13:17,693 --> 01:13:22,096
<i>The forcible integration of the
public schools of Little Rock</i>

1063
01:13:22,164 --> 01:13:26,794
<i>against the overwhelming sentiment
of the people of the area.</i>

1064
01:13:37,312 --> 01:13:39,041
<i>Two, four, six, eight!</i>

1065
01:13:39,114 --> 01:13:40,775
<i>We don't want to integrate!</i>

1066
01:13:41,083 --> 01:13:42,675
<i>Two, four, six, eight!</i>

1067
01:13:42,751 --> 01:13:44,651
<i>We don't want to integrate!</i>

1068
01:14:00,402 --> 01:14:02,734
<i>We still have
the attitude of love,</i>

1069
01:14:02,805 --> 01:14:07,504
<i>we still have the method
of passive resistance</i>

1070
01:14:07,576 --> 01:14:10,841
<i>and we are still
insisting emphatically,</i>

1071
01:14:10,913 --> 01:14:13,575
<i>that violence is
self-defeating.</i>

1072
01:14:13,949 --> 01:14:16,975
<i>That he who lives by the
sword will perish by the sword.</i>

1073
01:14:42,177 --> 01:14:43,769
This is quite a ruckus.

1074
01:14:43,846 --> 01:14:45,746
Hey, Ernie,
Roger Page, Channel Nine.

1075
01:14:45,814 --> 01:14:47,782
They're calling this game
the North against the South.

1076
01:14:47,850 --> 01:14:49,647
In light of what's
going on in this country,

1077
01:14:49,718 --> 01:14:52,016
do you feel added pressure
to represent change?

1078
01:14:52,087 --> 01:14:55,181
We don't concern
ourselves with politics.

1079
01:14:55,257 --> 01:14:57,691
We're just here to
play a great football game

1080
01:14:58,126 --> 01:14:59,218
and take home
the championship.

1081
01:14:59,294 --> 01:15:01,558
To be honest, Mr. Page,
when I'm out on that field,

1082
01:15:01,630 --> 01:15:04,224
I only think about
winning the game.

1083
01:15:04,833 --> 01:15:08,496
But that doesn't mean I don't
know the color of my own skin.

1084
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:12,969
Let's check in.

1085
01:15:17,980 --> 01:15:19,675
We've got a problem, Ben.

1086
01:15:19,815 --> 01:15:20,907
What?

1087
01:15:21,116 --> 01:15:24,984
The Aristocrat Hotel does not
allow coloreds to stay here.

1088
01:15:26,688 --> 01:15:28,849
I need my team together, Lew.

1089
01:15:28,924 --> 01:15:32,121
Now, you do whatever it takes
to make that happen.

1090
01:15:32,461 --> 01:15:35,362
What's the problem?
What's the problem here?

1091
01:15:40,903 --> 01:15:42,996
Right this way, gentlemen.

1092
01:15:50,412 --> 01:15:53,848
Fellas, looks like we once
again found the Negro wing.

1093
01:16:01,557 --> 01:16:03,115
State seven!
State seven!

1094
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:06,022
Set!
- Double tight! Double tight!

1095
01:16:06,094 --> 01:16:07,857
Wing left,
watch it.

1096
01:16:18,874 --> 01:16:20,000
Stop!

1097
01:16:21,944 --> 01:16:24,572
Do you think it is
the New York City Ballet

1098
01:16:24,646 --> 01:16:27,046
that's going to be running
up your ass on New Year's day?

1099
01:16:27,115 --> 01:16:29,208
These are the goddamn
Texas Longhorns!

1100
01:16:29,284 --> 01:16:31,752
If you cannot fight off
blocks better than that,

1101
01:16:31,820 --> 01:16:34,448
let's just get on
the bus and go home.

1102
01:16:34,823 --> 01:16:36,688
Run the play again!

1103
01:16:51,506 --> 01:16:52,564
Shit!

1104
01:16:54,543 --> 01:16:56,010
My hamstring!

1105
01:16:57,112 --> 01:17:00,309
This may be
a blessing in disguise.

1106
01:17:00,382 --> 01:17:01,576
Look at these.

1107
01:17:10,325 --> 01:17:11,383
Where did you get these?

1108
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:12,552
Where did I get them?

1109
01:17:12,628 --> 01:17:15,597
They were sent to the
hotel to your boys.

1110
01:17:16,798 --> 01:17:18,265
Scare tactics.

1111
01:17:18,333 --> 01:17:20,563
Doesn't have a goddamn
thing to do with football.

1112
01:17:20,636 --> 01:17:22,729
We shouldn't play him.

1113
01:17:22,838 --> 01:17:25,398
Maybe not even Art or Jack
but especially Ernie.

1114
01:17:25,474 --> 01:17:26,805
The NCAA is on my back.

1115
01:17:26,875 --> 01:17:30,504
Even the Mayor of Dallas is
nervous, afraid of race riots.

1116
01:17:32,247 --> 01:17:34,977
Lew, you hired me to win.

1117
01:17:35,584 --> 01:17:37,848
Well, I'm here at
the goddamn Cotton Bowl,

1118
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:40,046
and this time
we're gonna win it.

1119
01:17:40,122 --> 01:17:42,056
So why don't you tell that
to the Mayor of Dallas?

1120
01:17:42,124 --> 01:17:45,457
I'm playing. You hear me?
I'm playing.

1121
01:17:46,161 --> 01:17:48,391
You're goddamn right you are.

1122
01:17:55,003 --> 01:17:58,598
There's an electricity
in the air today in Dallas.

1123
01:17:58,674 --> 01:18:00,801
And, as you can see from
the clear skies behind me,

1124
01:18:00,876 --> 01:18:02,867
it's not
a local thunderstorm.

1125
01:18:02,944 --> 01:18:06,311
All eyes are on the field
as undefeated Syracuse,

1126
01:18:06,381 --> 01:18:07,973
the Beast from the East,

1127
01:18:08,050 --> 01:18:11,042
takes on Texas, the power
of the Southwest Conference.

1128
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:20,153
Do I need to say anything?

1129
01:18:20,529 --> 01:18:22,497
Come on, it's on!

1130
01:18:22,564 --> 01:18:24,691
Come on, it's on, the
Cotton Bowl. Come on, Marie.

1131
01:18:24,766 --> 01:18:26,131
Come on. Come on. Come on.

1132
01:18:26,201 --> 01:18:27,896
All right, all right.

1133
01:18:27,969 --> 01:18:29,163
Get two ice teas,
please.

1134
01:18:29,237 --> 01:18:30,431
And the Cotton Bowl.

1135
01:18:33,508 --> 01:18:35,169
Drop your heads.

1136
01:18:36,578 --> 01:18:38,910
Our Father,
who art in heaven,

1137
01:18:39,681 --> 01:18:41,546
hallowed be thy name.

1138
01:18:41,616 --> 01:18:44,244
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done...

1139
01:18:49,057 --> 01:18:51,491
George,
fancy seeing you here.

1140
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:52,993
You taking a look at Davis?

1141
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:54,684
I've seen him.

1142
01:18:54,763 --> 01:18:55,787
Really?

1143
01:18:56,098 --> 01:18:58,089
In a Redskins uniform?

1144
01:18:58,333 --> 01:19:01,427
I think he'd look better
in a Cleveland uniform.

1145
01:19:03,105 --> 01:19:05,266
Now, wouldn't that
be something?

1146
01:19:05,340 --> 01:19:08,332
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
please give a warm Texas welcome</i>

1147
01:19:08,410 --> 01:19:11,208
<i>to the Syracuse
University Orangemen.</i>

1148
01:19:12,514 --> 01:19:14,607
With a phenomenal record
of 10-0,

1149
01:19:14,683 --> 01:19:18,084
Ben Schwartzwalder and his
mighty Orangemen of Syracuse,

1150
01:19:18,153 --> 01:19:19,814
<i>ranked number 1
in the nation,</i>

1151
01:19:19,888 --> 01:19:23,016
<i>take the field here at the
historic Cotton Bowl in Dallas</i>

1152
01:19:23,091 --> 01:19:24,581
<i>to face Darrell Royal</i>

1153
01:19:24,659 --> 01:19:27,526
<i>and the second-ranked
Longhorns of Texas.</i>

1154
01:19:31,433 --> 01:19:32,957
You ready for this?

1155
01:19:33,034 --> 01:19:34,092
I'm ready.

1156
01:19:34,169 --> 01:19:35,830
Get off the field!

1157
01:19:46,581 --> 01:19:49,573
<i>If the Orangemen are going to
be successful moving the football today,</i>

1158
01:19:49,651 --> 01:19:52,677
they're going to have to go
through Clay Taylor and Pete Logan,

1159
01:19:52,754 --> 01:19:54,847
<i>two very dominant
football players</i>

1160
01:19:54,923 --> 01:19:57,687
<i>and the defensive leaders
for the Longhorns.</i>

1161
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:01,520
Davis, hamstring.

1162
01:20:07,936 --> 01:20:09,130
Tails.

1163
01:20:10,205 --> 01:20:11,433
Syracuse receives!

1164
01:20:11,506 --> 01:20:12,734
That's what we wanted.

1165
01:20:12,808 --> 01:20:13,900
Go, boy.
- Get them.

1166
01:20:13,975 --> 01:20:18,207
Ernie, if you get the ball,
go all the way.

1167
01:20:20,715 --> 01:20:23,047
Let's go!Let's go!
- Let's go, four-four.

1168
01:20:40,202 --> 01:20:43,535
<i>And the 1960
Cotton Bowl is underway.</i>

1169
01:20:53,648 --> 01:20:54,706
Offense! Let's go!

1170
01:20:54,783 --> 01:20:57,251
<i>An incredibly
enthusiastic crowd on hand</i>

1171
01:20:57,319 --> 01:21:00,254
<i>as Syracuse lines up
for its first series.</i>

1172
01:21:01,323 --> 01:21:02,449
I've been waiting
for this nigger.

1173
01:21:02,524 --> 01:21:04,287
Okie. Okie. Set!

1174
01:21:04,359 --> 01:21:06,520
I'm about to kick your black
ass back to Africa, boy.

1175
01:21:06,595 --> 01:21:09,029
Oh, yeah?
Too bad I'm from Philly.

1176
01:21:10,332 --> 01:21:11,856
<i>The give
is to Ernie Davis.</i>

1177
01:21:11,933 --> 01:21:15,596
<i>He gains two yards and is brought
down quickly by Taylor and Logan.</i>

1178
01:21:15,670 --> 01:21:17,399
We're in the Cotton
Bowl, not the cotton patch, boys.

1179
01:21:17,472 --> 01:21:19,064
Personal foul, ref!
- 84!

1180
01:21:19,140 --> 01:21:20,368
84, ref.

1181
01:21:20,442 --> 01:21:22,103
<i>The handkerchief
on the field.</i>

1182
01:21:22,177 --> 01:21:26,079
<i>There appears to be some late
contact by both Taylor and Logan.</i>

1183
01:21:26,147 --> 01:21:27,876
Holding, offense!

1184
01:21:30,018 --> 01:21:31,781
That's bullshit.
- Will!

1185
01:21:31,853 --> 01:21:33,320
But there, did you see that?
- I saw it.

1186
01:21:33,889 --> 01:21:35,652
You don't stop this quick,
it's gonna get out of hand.

1187
01:21:35,724 --> 01:21:37,817
That's one.
You've been warned.

1188
01:21:37,893 --> 01:21:40,327
"I've been warned."
What are you, my first grade teacher?

1189
01:21:40,395 --> 01:21:44,297
<i>Sophomore Davis is
clearly favoring his right leg</i>

1190
01:21:44,366 --> 01:21:46,266
<i>as he moves back to
the Orangemen huddle.</i>

1191
01:21:46,334 --> 01:21:48,461
Okay, on one,
on one. Ready?

1192
01:21:50,038 --> 01:21:53,007
<i>The Orangemen
facing first and 20.</i>

1193
01:21:53,074 --> 01:21:54,405
<i>It's to Davis.</i>

1194
01:21:54,776 --> 01:21:57,142
<i>Runs to his left.
Looks to throw.</i>

1195
01:21:57,212 --> 01:21:58,770
<i>Now cuts back to the right</i>

1196
01:21:58,847 --> 01:22:01,873
with a dazzling spin move,
and sheds the tackler.

1197
01:22:09,024 --> 01:22:12,755
<i>He turns the corner.
He's in the clear. He's gone!</i>

1198
01:22:12,827 --> 01:22:16,524
Quick. Go! Go! Go! Go!

1199
01:22:17,933 --> 01:22:19,059
Go!

1200
01:22:26,808 --> 01:22:30,005
<i>He's drilled out of
bounds at the 3-yard line.</i>

1201
01:22:30,512 --> 01:22:34,039
And now Davis, who's lying
prone on the sidelines,

1202
01:22:34,115 --> 01:22:37,642
<i>appears to be
either exhausted or hurt.</i>

1203
01:22:40,588 --> 01:22:42,852
<i>I can't believe
they caught him.</i>

1204
01:22:42,924 --> 01:22:44,482
Ernie, get up!

1205
01:22:45,927 --> 01:22:48,452
Ernie! Ernie!

1206
01:22:48,530 --> 01:22:50,964
Ernie, you all right?

1207
01:22:51,032 --> 01:22:53,262
<i>Davis is finally
helped to his feet</i>

1208
01:22:53,335 --> 01:22:56,168
<i>by All-American
tackler Jack Buckley.</i>

1209
01:22:56,237 --> 01:22:58,000
<i>One has to wonder</i>

1210
01:22:58,073 --> 01:23:00,735
<i>just what kind of shape Ernie Davis is in.
- I told you.</i>

1211
01:23:03,345 --> 01:23:06,781
<i>Syracuse, first down
at the Longhorn three.</i>

1212
01:23:06,848 --> 01:23:10,181
<i>The give is to the right
halfback, Gerhard Schwedes.</i>

1213
01:23:10,251 --> 01:23:12,378
<i>Outstanding block by Davis.</i>

1214
01:23:12,454 --> 01:23:16,288
<i>He crosses the goal line
to put Syracuse on the board.</i>

1215
01:23:17,292 --> 01:23:18,782
<i>Here in the second quarter</i>

1216
01:23:18,860 --> 01:23:22,352
Coach Ben Schwartzwalder and his
top-ranked team find themselves

1217
01:23:22,430 --> 01:23:25,365
on top of
the Texas Longhorns, 7-0.

1218
01:23:25,433 --> 01:23:26,457
Ready?
- Break!

1219
01:23:26,534 --> 01:23:28,365
<i>The Orangemen are knocking
on the door once again.</i>

1220
01:23:28,436 --> 01:23:30,631
State seven!
State seven!

1221
01:23:30,705 --> 01:23:32,696
Set! Hut one.

1222
01:23:34,642 --> 01:23:38,976
<i>The give is to Ernie Davis and
the sophomore finds the end zone,</i>

1223
01:23:39,047 --> 01:23:42,881
<i>as the Orangemen increase
their lead on the Longhorns!</i>

1224
01:23:43,118 --> 01:23:44,176
So precisely when is it
you're going to

1225
01:23:44,252 --> 01:23:46,186
start kicking my
black ass back to Africa?

1226
01:23:49,357 --> 01:23:50,415
Hey, Buckley!

1227
01:23:50,492 --> 01:23:51,516
Hey, come on, stay cool.

1228
01:23:51,593 --> 01:23:53,561
They're baiting us.
- They're baiting them.

1229
01:23:53,628 --> 01:23:56,756
Hey, Logan, Taylor,
44 is embarrassing you.

1230
01:23:57,499 --> 01:24:00,195
And after a successful
two-point conversion

1231
01:24:00,268 --> 01:24:04,102
the Orangemen of Syracuse
lead the Longhorns of Texas

1232
01:24:04,172 --> 01:24:06,197
by a score of 15-0.

1233
01:24:07,575 --> 01:24:10,009
<i>McKinley on
a sweep to the right.</i>

1234
01:24:11,846 --> 01:24:15,873
<i>Bobby Lundy steps up and
there's a huge hit on McKinley.</i>

1235
01:24:15,950 --> 01:24:18,851
<i>And the ball is loose,
recovered by the Orangemen</i>

1236
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:20,888
<i>and Syracuse takes over.</i>

1237
01:24:20,955 --> 01:24:22,081
Yeah.

1238
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:27,591
<i>My,
that's a cheap shot.</i>

1239
01:24:27,662 --> 01:24:30,563
<i>A late hit by Talbert
on Ernie Davis</i>

1240
01:24:30,632 --> 01:24:32,691
<i>after the play
was whistled dead.</i>

1241
01:24:32,767 --> 01:24:36,168
Back! Everybody,
back! Back! Back! Back!

1242
01:24:36,237 --> 01:24:38,102
You all right, son?
You okay?

1243
01:24:38,173 --> 01:24:39,231
I'm all right, Coach.

1244
01:24:39,307 --> 01:24:41,002
All right. You sure?
- Yeah.

1245
01:24:41,076 --> 01:24:43,408
Offense on the field.
Let's go!

1246
01:24:46,881 --> 01:24:49,543
Told you this would get out
of hand. This is bullshit.

1247
01:24:49,617 --> 01:24:53,075
<i>Syracuse will run
one last play before halftime.</i>

1248
01:24:53,788 --> 01:24:54,982
Pack your bags, spook.

1249
01:24:55,056 --> 01:24:56,216
Scoreboard, eight-four.

1250
01:24:56,291 --> 01:24:57,758
Come on,
let's just play ball.

1251
01:24:57,826 --> 01:24:59,088
You defending this nigger?

1252
01:24:59,160 --> 01:25:01,060
How you gonna call yourself
a white Christian?

1253
01:25:01,129 --> 01:25:02,494
I'm Jewish.

1254
01:25:03,231 --> 01:25:04,459
Hut one!

1255
01:25:15,410 --> 01:25:17,105
That's another late hit.

1256
01:25:17,178 --> 01:25:20,511
<i>And once again,
Ernie Davis is pummeled!</i>

1257
01:25:21,749 --> 01:25:23,774
Break it up, ref!

1258
01:25:28,189 --> 01:25:30,282
Come on, ref,
do something.

1259
01:25:37,565 --> 01:25:39,965
<i>And both teams
are clearing their benches</i>

1260
01:25:40,034 --> 01:25:41,763
<i>and heading to
the middle of the field.</i>

1261
01:25:41,836 --> 01:25:43,269
Ref, I told you to
do something about this.

1262
01:25:43,338 --> 01:25:46,501
<i>This has become a fiasco.
It's a donnybrook.</i>

1263
01:25:51,646 --> 01:25:52,738
My God, no.
- This...

1264
01:25:52,814 --> 01:25:55,112
<i>This is no longer a football
game, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

1265
01:25:59,921 --> 01:26:01,582
Is somebody
gonna stop this?

1266
01:26:01,656 --> 01:26:03,021
<i>... ugly display...</i>

1267
01:26:03,591 --> 01:26:06,219
Get off! Get off the field!

1268
01:26:06,294 --> 01:26:07,886
Hey, Coach!

1269
01:26:09,430 --> 01:26:10,954
Get off of him!
- Break it up!

1270
01:26:11,032 --> 01:26:12,829
Petey, you all right?

1271
01:26:38,526 --> 01:26:39,550
You guys see
what happened?

1272
01:26:39,627 --> 01:26:40,992
Come on,
cozy up to the blackboard.

1273
01:26:41,062 --> 01:26:42,996
You see what happened,
Lundy? That's what I'm telling you.

1274
01:26:43,064 --> 01:26:44,531
You can't let people
talk to you like this,

1275
01:26:44,599 --> 01:26:46,066
be pounding on your leg
the whole time.

1276
01:26:46,134 --> 01:26:48,967
I know, but you'll
get ejected. They won't.

1277
01:26:51,139 --> 01:26:52,902
You're done for the day.

1278
01:26:52,974 --> 01:26:54,874
We're up by 15.
We can take it from here.

1279
01:26:54,943 --> 01:26:56,308
Coach, I can still get
back out there and play.

1280
01:26:56,377 --> 01:26:59,312
No, I want you to
put some ice on that leg.

1281
01:27:07,855 --> 01:27:10,722
I had a halftime speech
all planned out.

1282
01:27:12,427 --> 01:27:15,760
It seemed pretty good
up till about 10 minutes ago.

1283
01:27:16,130 --> 01:27:19,463
It was all about victory
and champions and glory.

1284
01:27:24,005 --> 01:27:26,530
But this is not
just a game anymore.

1285
01:27:28,142 --> 01:27:31,475
We're fighting something else
out on that field right now.

1286
01:27:32,513 --> 01:27:35,038
And I can see it
just as clearly as you.

1287
01:27:38,419 --> 01:27:40,353
And that's why
winning this one

1288
01:27:40,421 --> 01:27:43,481
means nothing
if you lose yourselves.

1289
01:27:46,127 --> 01:27:48,118
Don't give this one away.

1290
01:27:48,763 --> 01:27:51,823
Keep it. Hold on to it
for yourselves

1291
01:27:51,899 --> 01:27:53,799
and for everyone
in this room.

1292
01:27:54,969 --> 01:27:57,369
It's here. It's right here.

1293
01:27:57,438 --> 01:28:00,100
And no one can
take it from you, gentlemen.

1294
01:28:00,174 --> 01:28:02,233
Not the officials,
not the crowds

1295
01:28:02,310 --> 01:28:04,335
and certainly
not the other team.

1296
01:28:08,016 --> 01:28:10,246
It belongs to you, gentlemen.

1297
01:28:14,889 --> 01:28:18,086
Don't you let anyone
steal history away from you.

1298
01:28:24,098 --> 01:28:25,156
Glory!
- Glory!

1299
01:28:25,233 --> 01:28:27,758
<i>As play resumes
here at the Cotton Bowl,</i>

1300
01:28:27,835 --> 01:28:30,668
<i>Ernie Davis has not joined
the rest of the Orangemen</i>

1301
01:28:30,738 --> 01:28:32,330
<i>for the second half.</i>

1302
01:28:32,407 --> 01:28:34,807
<i>Down 15 to nothing,
the Longhorns are</i>

1303
01:28:34,876 --> 01:28:37,344
<i>desperate to get
something on the board.</i>

1304
01:28:38,446 --> 01:28:41,074
<i>Bobby Lackey
drops back to pass.</i>

1305
01:28:42,417 --> 01:28:44,977
<i>And it's complete
to Bobby Gurwitz</i>

1306
01:28:45,053 --> 01:28:48,022
<i>for a 69-yard
Texas touchdown!</i>

1307
01:28:48,823 --> 01:28:52,759
<i>What a throw by the Heisman-hopeful
quarterback from Texas.</i>

1308
01:28:53,127 --> 01:28:56,927
<i>A 69-yard touchdown pass
caught by number 24, Bobby Gurwitz.</i>

1309
01:28:58,533 --> 01:29:00,057
Goal line,
goal line. Ready?

1310
01:29:00,134 --> 01:29:04,571
<i>Darrell Royal and Texas
opt to go for the two-point conversion.</i>

1311
01:29:06,074 --> 01:29:10,238
Another walloping tackle
by Syracuse's Bob Lundy.

1312
01:29:10,311 --> 01:29:12,472
That'll mean
something later on.

1313
01:29:12,547 --> 01:29:14,515
<i>Midway
through the third quarter,</i>

1314
01:29:14,582 --> 01:29:19,076
<i>Syracuse protecting a 15-6
lead against the Longhorns.</i>

1315
01:29:19,153 --> 01:29:20,814
Three.
- Hut, hut!

1316
01:29:20,888 --> 01:29:22,515
<i>Sarette with a fake to Baker.</i>

1317
01:29:22,590 --> 01:29:24,558
<i>Options to Schwedes.</i>

1318
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:29,194
<i>Schwedes is hammered by
Muehling and coughs up the ball.</i>

1319
01:29:29,263 --> 01:29:30,628
All right! Let's go!

1320
01:29:30,698 --> 01:29:32,689
Protect the ball!

1321
01:29:36,971 --> 01:29:41,533
<i>And watch out! The Longhorns
are building some momentum.</i>

1322
01:29:47,582 --> 01:29:51,541
Texas, knocking on the door
at the goal line.

1323
01:29:53,921 --> 01:29:58,153
<i>Bobby Lackey calls his own
number and finds the end zone.</i>

1324
01:29:58,760 --> 01:30:02,821
The Longhorns have suddenly given
us a football game here in Dallas.

1325
01:30:05,233 --> 01:30:07,633
<i>Lackey drops back to pass,</i>

1326
01:30:08,069 --> 01:30:10,299
<i>and it's complete to Paul.</i>

1327
01:30:10,371 --> 01:30:14,774
Syracuse 15, Texas 14.

1328
01:30:14,842 --> 01:30:17,743
<i>The Longhorns have made it
a one-point game.</i>

1329
01:30:28,022 --> 01:30:29,455
Tough break.

1330
01:30:31,959 --> 01:30:34,689
I mean, they probably
got it in hand.

1331
01:30:34,762 --> 01:30:37,390
Baker, Schwedes,
they're good backs.

1332
01:30:40,401 --> 01:30:43,029
But no sense in
getting hurt worse, right?

1333
01:30:46,374 --> 01:30:49,002
Entering the fourth
quarter of play,

1334
01:30:49,076 --> 01:30:52,876
the tension level here at
the Cotton Bowl is palpable.

1335
01:30:53,548 --> 01:30:55,948
We let them
right back in the game.

1336
01:30:58,419 --> 01:31:00,649
Coach, Davis.

1337
01:31:02,223 --> 01:31:04,384
All right, boys, keep your heads
in the game. Don't worry about it.

1338
01:31:04,459 --> 01:31:05,687
Ernie, what are you doing?

1339
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:07,421
I need to talk to you, Coach.
I need you to ice that leg.

1340
01:31:07,495 --> 01:31:09,019
I already have. I need
to talk to you for a sec.

1341
01:31:09,096 --> 01:31:10,825
No, no, you are not playing.
- Just listen to me for a sec.

1342
01:31:10,898 --> 01:31:11,922
You can watch,
but you cannot play.

1343
01:31:11,999 --> 01:31:14,024
Just hear me out, Coach.

1344
01:31:15,603 --> 01:31:19,903
Coach, on the trip down here I saw
a lot of things out that bus window.

1345
01:31:19,974 --> 01:31:22,204
Now, we get to Dallas,
they got me, Jack and Art

1346
01:31:22,276 --> 01:31:24,141
in a tiny room with cots.

1347
01:31:24,212 --> 01:31:26,942
We can't use the elevator 'cause
we might scare the white folks.

1348
01:31:27,014 --> 01:31:29,915
Can't even walk in
the front door of a hotel.

1349
01:31:31,586 --> 01:31:34,020
Now, all those people
who did that,

1350
01:31:34,088 --> 01:31:36,454
who believe that's right,
are watching.

1351
01:31:41,596 --> 01:31:43,928
But you know what,
so are they.

1352
01:31:54,909 --> 01:31:55,898
Can you even run?

1353
01:31:55,977 --> 01:31:57,035
Yes, sir.

1354
01:31:57,111 --> 01:31:58,476
I don't want to
hurt you anymore.

1355
01:31:58,546 --> 01:32:00,070
I'm ready.

1356
01:32:02,650 --> 01:32:04,174
All right.

1357
01:32:04,252 --> 01:32:07,050
Strong load right,
42 shovel pass.

1358
01:32:07,121 --> 01:32:08,952
Go.
- Let's go, Ernie.

1359
01:32:09,423 --> 01:32:14,122
And now the 76,000 fans at
the Cotton Bowl are stunned!

1360
01:32:14,362 --> 01:32:18,526
<i>Ernie Davis has
returned to the playing field.</i>

1361
01:32:21,135 --> 01:32:22,159
Let's go.

1362
01:32:22,236 --> 01:32:23,669
Man, that's Ernie Davis!

1363
01:32:27,575 --> 01:32:28,599
Strong left.

1364
01:32:28,676 --> 01:32:31,110
Six regular!
Six regular! Tight.

1365
01:32:31,178 --> 01:32:34,875
<i>The Orangemen,
ball on their own 40-yard line,</i>

1366
01:32:34,949 --> 01:32:36,416
<i>are desperate
for a first down</i>

1367
01:32:36,484 --> 01:32:38,679
<i>to keep the ball
out of the hands</i>

1368
01:32:38,753 --> 01:32:41,722
<i>of Longhorn quarterback
Bobby Lackey.</i>

1369
01:32:43,224 --> 01:32:44,953
<i>And the ball comes loose.</i>

1370
01:32:46,360 --> 01:32:48,123
<i>Texas has recovered.</i>

1371
01:32:48,195 --> 01:32:49,526
His knee was down, ref.

1372
01:32:49,597 --> 01:32:50,655
First down, Texas!

1373
01:32:50,731 --> 01:32:51,857
Bad call, ref.

1374
01:32:51,933 --> 01:32:53,400
My knee was down, sir.

1375
01:32:53,467 --> 01:32:56,595
They're trying to steal it from us.
- I was down.

1376
01:32:56,671 --> 01:32:59,697
Franklin, Franklin,
get in there for Davis, go.

1377
01:32:59,774 --> 01:33:02,368
No. Get back. I'm staying
in. I'm staying in.

1378
01:33:02,443 --> 01:33:03,842
Regulations!

1379
01:33:06,781 --> 01:33:12,219
<i>Texas on the 40-yard line with
the ball and with the game's momentum.</i>

1380
01:33:12,286 --> 01:33:15,881
<i>Bobby Lackey
drops back to pass.</i>

1381
01:33:15,957 --> 01:33:19,825
<i>Throws downfield,
he's got a receiver open.</i>

1382
01:33:25,466 --> 01:33:26,455
Go! Go!

1383
01:33:26,534 --> 01:33:27,865
All the way!
All the way!

1384
01:33:31,672 --> 01:33:34,664
That's the way.
Offense, offense, let's go!

1385
01:33:34,742 --> 01:33:36,004
Let's take advantage.

1386
01:33:36,811 --> 01:33:38,802
Get out there. Let's go!

1387
01:33:41,115 --> 01:33:44,209
<i>First down,
10 yards to go from the 13.</i>

1388
01:33:45,186 --> 01:33:47,154
<i>Syracuse has to
move the chains</i>

1389
01:33:47,221 --> 01:33:49,246
<i>and keep the clock
ticking down</i>

1390
01:33:49,323 --> 01:33:52,349
<i>or put this game away
with another touchdown.</i>

1391
01:33:52,727 --> 01:33:54,024
Hut one.

1392
01:34:06,440 --> 01:34:07,907
Yeah! Yeah, go, go, go!

1393
01:34:07,975 --> 01:34:09,465
He's behind you. Go!

1394
01:34:09,543 --> 01:34:11,272
That's it! That's it.

1395
01:34:20,087 --> 01:34:21,748
He got this. Go!

1396
01:34:39,707 --> 01:34:42,039
<i>An
unbelievable play!</i>

1397
01:34:42,109 --> 01:34:44,202
Ernie Davis scoring

1398
01:34:44,278 --> 01:34:49,272
on an amazing
87-yard catch and run!

1399
01:35:02,730 --> 01:35:04,823
<i>With the final seconds
ticking away...</i>

1400
01:35:04,899 --> 01:35:05,991
Stay in the game.

1401
01:35:06,067 --> 01:35:07,625
Stay in the game.
It's not over.

1402
01:35:07,702 --> 01:35:10,398
<i>... the Longhorns are looking
to tie this game up</i>

1403
01:35:10,471 --> 01:35:13,235
<i>with a last chance
shot at the end zone.</i>

1404
01:36:14,001 --> 01:36:18,631
All right, ladies, settle down. Settle
down. Give me your undivided attention. Hey!

1405
01:36:18,706 --> 01:36:20,697
It's just been announced,

1406
01:36:21,342 --> 01:36:25,574
the 1960 Cotton Bowl MVP.
Congratulations to Mr. Ernie Davis.

1407
01:36:28,916 --> 01:36:30,543
Ernie!
Congrats.

1408
01:36:31,318 --> 01:36:32,649
Come here.

1409
01:36:33,788 --> 01:36:35,585
Congratulations, brother.

1410
01:36:35,656 --> 01:36:37,521
All right,
everybody, listen up.

1411
01:36:37,591 --> 01:36:40,253
This gentleman
wants to say something.

1412
01:36:41,829 --> 01:36:43,126
Go ahead.

1413
01:36:45,432 --> 01:36:50,802
What the man is trying to say is
that the trophy ceremony in our honor

1414
01:36:50,871 --> 01:36:53,567
will be held at Oak Hill
Country Club tonight.

1415
01:36:53,641 --> 01:36:55,108
Great.
- Very nice.

1416
01:36:55,176 --> 01:36:59,135
Unfortunately, the Oak Hill
Country Club is color restricted.

1417
01:37:00,514 --> 01:37:01,845
Which means
that three of us,

1418
01:37:01,916 --> 01:37:06,853
including the player who was awarded
the Cotton Bowl MVP today, cannot attend.

1419
01:37:08,255 --> 01:37:09,415
Seriously?

1420
01:37:09,490 --> 01:37:10,616
Ridiculous.

1421
01:37:14,562 --> 01:37:16,894
Now, how do we
feel about that?

1422
01:37:17,565 --> 01:37:19,499
I don't know about you,

1423
01:37:20,067 --> 01:37:23,332
but I hear they have some
great barbecue down here.

1424
01:38:53,627 --> 01:38:55,060
You read it.

1425
01:38:58,032 --> 01:39:01,763
"To Syracuse University
department of athletics.

1426
01:39:02,169 --> 01:39:05,195

1428

Congratulations, Ernie.

1429
01:39:21,789 --> 01:39:24,087
We're ready

<i>... or witnessed more closely...</i>

1431
01:39:30,097 --> 01:39:31,496
Good luck, Mr. Davis.

1432

Thank you, sir.

<i>... the importance of the gridiron

1434

<i>... than John W. Heisman. So,
it is with distinct pleasure...</i>

1435
01:39:44,044 --> 01:39:45,944
No matter what
happens up there,

1436
01:39:46,013 --> 01:39:48,004
I want you to know that I'm
really proud of you, son.

1437
01:39:48,082 --> 01:39:50,915
<i>... the memorial
trophy bearing his name.</i>

1438
01:39:50,985 --> 01:39:55,547
<i>The first is Ernest R. Davis
from Syracuse University.</i>

1439
01:40:03,497 --> 01:40:07,627
<i>Our next nominee is Robert Ferguson,
Ohio State University.</i>

1440
01:40:10,304 --> 01:40:15,003
<i>Our third nominee is James Saxton,
the University of Texas.</i>

1441
01:40:16,377 --> 01:40:17,366
Congratulations.

1442
01:40:17,444 --> 01:40:19,503
Thanks, man.

1443
01:40:23,017 --> 01:40:24,848
<i>The Heisman Trophy has,</i>

1444
01:40:24,918 --> 01:40:30,288
<i>since 1935, represented everything that
is great about collegiate athletics.</i>

1445
01:40:30,357 --> 01:40:36,057
<i>And these three fine young men
represent their teams, their schools</i>

1446
01:40:36,363 --> 01:40:38,558
<i>and their families
with honor.</i>

1447
01:40:38,999 --> 01:40:42,162
<i>The voting for this year's
award was the closest in history</i>

1448
01:40:42,236 --> 01:40:45,000
<i>and each of these
players is deserving.</i>

1449
01:40:45,072 --> 01:40:50,237
<i>That said, the winner of this
year's Heisman Memorial Trophy is</i>

1450
01:40:54,815 --> 01:40:57,909
<i>Ernest R. Davis from
Syracuse University.</i>

1451
01:41:09,196 --> 01:41:10,254
Congratulations.

1452
01:41:10,330 --> 01:41:11,319
Thank you.

1453
01:41:13,233 --> 01:41:14,564
Congratulations.

1454
01:41:14,701 --> 01:41:15,963
I appreciate it.

1455
01:41:18,038 --> 01:41:19,972
Congratulations, Ernie.
- Thank you.

1456
01:41:20,040 --> 01:41:21,564
You did great.

1457
01:41:33,053 --> 01:41:36,079
<i>First, I'd like to thank
the Heisman committee.</i>

1458
01:41:39,359 --> 01:41:40,519
<i>Sarah,</i>

1459
01:41:41,662 --> 01:41:43,027
<i>my family,</i>

1460
01:41:43,931 --> 01:41:45,296
<i>Mom,</i>

1461

<i>Will,</i>

1462
01:41:51,505 --> 01:41:52,699
<i>and...</i>

1463
01:41:54,341 --> 01:41:57,674
<i>And Pops for
believing in me.</i>

1464
01:41:58,912 --> 01:42:01,881
<i>And Jim Brown for letting
me wear his number.</i>

1465
01:42:07,121 --> 01:42:10,887
<i>I'd also like to thank my
head coach, Ben Schwartzwalder,</i>

1466
01:42:12,593 --> 01:42:17,155
<i>for making me better,
being a good teacher,</i>

1467
01:42:18,665 --> 01:42:20,792
<i>and for being a good man.</i>

1468
01:42:26,173 --> 01:42:27,970
<i>Thank you, everyone.</i>

1469
01:42:45,726 --> 01:42:47,353
Where exactly
are we going?

1470
01:42:47,427 --> 01:42:48,689
Right this way.

1471
01:43:02,109 --> 01:43:06,603
Ernie, I was in town and I wanted
to get a chance to meet you.

1472
01:43:07,147 --> 01:43:10,878
I know today is a proud day for you.
You've really accomplished something here.

1473
01:43:10,951 --> 01:43:11,940
Congratulations.

1474
01:43:12,019 --> 01:43:13,850
Thank you, Mr. President.

1475
01:43:16,256 --> 01:43:17,746
<i>Fourth down, 9 yards.</i>

1476
01:43:18,692 --> 01:43:22,753
Must be nice having the number
one draft pick, huh, George?

1477
01:43:22,829 --> 01:43:25,127
I'm sure Ernie Davis
is a fine boy,

1478
01:43:25,199 --> 01:43:30,136
but I'll start signing Negroes when the
Harlem Globetrotters start signing whites.

1479
01:43:31,205 --> 01:43:34,868
Mr. Modell, George Marshall from the
Washington Redskins is on the phone.

1480
01:43:34,942 --> 01:43:36,569
Of course he is.

1481
01:43:37,477 --> 01:43:40,275
George, what a surprise
to hear from you.

1482
01:43:41,448 --> 01:43:44,076
You do?
Okay, I'm listening.

1483
01:43:45,485 --> 01:43:46,747
It's all
over the wire.

1484
01:43:46,820 --> 01:43:49,687
The Redskins just traded their
number one pick to Cleveland.

1485
01:43:49,756 --> 01:43:51,155
You're a commodity now.

1486
01:43:51,225 --> 01:43:54,956
Yeah, you should listen to your lawyer,
man. He's right. It's all business now.

1487
01:43:55,028 --> 01:43:56,586
Have you been sick recently?

1488
01:43:56,663 --> 01:43:58,392
No, I feel great.

1489
01:43:59,399 --> 01:44:02,630
I may be a commodity, but this
commodity is playing for Cleveland.

1490
01:44:02,703 --> 01:44:05,433
Me and Jim Brown in
the same backfield.

1491
01:44:05,505 --> 01:44:07,973
You're gonna steal
his number again?

1492
01:44:21,555 --> 01:44:23,113
Oh! Oh!

1493
01:44:23,724 --> 01:44:25,089
Stop it.

1494
01:44:30,197 --> 01:44:31,494
I don't want to leave.

1495
01:44:31,565 --> 01:44:32,827
You don't have to leave.

1496
01:44:32,899 --> 01:44:34,059
I do.

1497
01:44:35,168 --> 01:44:37,295
I should bring you with me.

1498
01:44:38,005 --> 01:44:41,099
Just jump in my suitcase.
You know you can fit.

1499
01:44:42,409 --> 01:44:43,467
Oh!

1500
01:44:44,177 --> 01:44:45,804
Oh, no.
- Oh, I slipped.

1501
01:44:46,413 --> 01:44:47,778
I'm sorry.

1502
01:44:52,152 --> 01:44:54,177
That was a mistake, too. I'm sorry.
- Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

1503
01:44:54,254 --> 01:44:56,222
I have to get
you a new blouse.

1504
01:44:59,526 --> 01:45:00,959
Look at you.

1505
01:45:03,930 --> 01:45:05,192
What are you doing?

1506
01:45:05,265 --> 01:45:06,493
He's at the 10.

1507
01:45:07,534 --> 01:45:09,900
The 20, the 30...

1508
01:45:12,072 --> 01:45:13,061
The 40...

1509
01:45:19,479 --> 01:45:21,640
Is that another
nose bleed?

1510
01:45:31,458 --> 01:45:32,982
You know, Hound Dog
says he gets hit so hard,

1511
01:45:33,060 --> 01:45:36,996
he wakes up with blood on his pillow.
Doesn't even know where it came from.

1512
01:45:37,064 --> 01:45:39,089
But you haven't been hit.

1513
01:45:41,968 --> 01:45:44,493
Ernie, you haven't
been hit. What...

1514
01:45:45,339 --> 01:45:48,069
Bus leaves for practice
in a half hour.

1515
01:45:50,210 --> 01:45:52,007
Be here when I get back?

1516
01:45:52,079 --> 01:45:53,103
I'll be here.

1517
01:46:06,493 --> 01:46:07,790
Right two to Maury,
right two to Maury.

1518
01:46:07,861 --> 01:46:09,226
Set? Go!

1519
01:46:15,802 --> 01:46:17,429
Stop.
Change your block, change your block.

1520
01:46:17,504 --> 01:46:22,203
Behind me, the East team led by
Syracuse's Ben Schwartzwalder.

1521
01:46:22,275 --> 01:46:24,175
Ernie Davis goes
through the paces

1522
01:46:24,244 --> 01:46:27,407
in preparation for Saturday
night's All-America game.

1523
01:46:30,384 --> 01:46:32,648
Davis look a little sluggish to you?

1524
01:46:32,719 --> 01:46:34,687
He'll be fine.

1525
01:46:34,755 --> 01:46:36,416
Tight right,
34 wide dig. Ready?

1526
01:46:36,490 --> 01:46:37,855
Come on!
- Break!

1527
01:46:39,760 --> 01:46:40,954
Okie. Okie.

1528
01:46:41,027 --> 01:46:43,086
Watch. Strong left.
Strong left!

1529
01:46:43,163 --> 01:46:44,323
Right!

1530
01:46:46,433 --> 01:46:48,924
Six box!
Six box! Set!

1531
01:46:51,471 --> 01:46:52,938
Hut! Hut!

1532
01:47:06,119 --> 01:47:08,815
All right, let's run
it again. Let's go.

1533
01:47:10,690 --> 01:47:13,659
It's all right.
You'll get them next time. Come on.

1534
01:47:34,047 --> 01:47:35,207
Ernie?

1535
01:47:36,116 --> 01:47:37,708
Ernie? You okay?

1536
01:48:08,348 --> 01:48:11,681
He's got to have another transfusion.
He's lost quite a lot of blood.

1537
01:48:11,751 --> 01:48:13,412
How'd he do that?
- We're not sure.

1538
01:48:13,487 --> 01:48:15,318
He's gonna need
further tests.

1539
01:48:15,388 --> 01:48:17,481
So test.
- Gentlemen.

1540
01:48:22,128 --> 01:48:24,961
Now what am I supposed
to tell the press?

1541
01:48:27,033 --> 01:48:28,557
Mumps.
- What?

1542
01:48:29,636 --> 01:48:32,161
He's got a bad
case of the mumps.

1543
01:48:32,239 --> 01:48:33,672
That's good.

1544
01:48:36,409 --> 01:48:39,435
Double tight!
Double tight! Down!

1545
01:48:43,149 --> 01:48:44,343
Set!

1546
01:48:46,119 --> 01:48:48,144
Blue 3-21!

1547
01:48:48,221 --> 01:48:50,018
Blue 3-21!

1548
01:48:50,090 --> 01:48:51,387
Hut! Hut!

1549
01:49:13,346 --> 01:49:15,143
Hey, Ernie!

1550
01:49:16,816 --> 01:49:18,807
The man wants to see you.

1551
01:49:21,388 --> 01:49:23,447
All right, get back.
- Let's go.

1552
01:49:26,793 --> 01:49:27,782
Hey.

1553
01:49:27,861 --> 01:49:28,919
Hey, Mr. Modell.

1554
01:49:28,995 --> 01:49:29,984
Hey.
- How are you?

1555
01:49:30,063 --> 01:49:31,121
I'm good. I've been
watching you.

1556
01:49:31,197 --> 01:49:32,596
I'm still trying to
find my rhythm out there.

1557
01:49:32,666 --> 01:49:34,133
You know, new system and all.
- Yeah, listen, Ernie.

1558
01:49:34,200 --> 01:49:35,497
All I need is some rest.
- Yeah, the system is...

1559
01:49:35,569 --> 01:49:36,558
Once I get used to it...

1560
01:49:36,636 --> 01:49:38,035
All right.
Ernie, Ernie, Ernie,

1561
01:49:38,104 --> 01:49:40,572
I spoke with
Dr. Hewlett and...

1562
01:49:41,641 --> 01:49:46,010
Look, he doesn't know what it is, but
they know something's not right, Ernie.

1563
01:49:46,613 --> 01:49:51,209
I should have told you earlier, kid.
I really can't clear you for practice.

1564
01:49:51,851 --> 01:49:54,547
If I can't practice,
how am I gonna play?

1565
01:49:54,955 --> 01:49:58,550
You're not gonna
play. Not now.

1566
01:49:58,925 --> 01:50:02,452
And maybe not
this season.

1567
01:50:09,469 --> 01:50:11,699
Well, when?

1568
01:50:13,406 --> 01:50:14,896
I don't know.

1569
01:50:16,142 --> 01:50:18,167
I don't know, kid.

1570
01:50:18,244 --> 01:50:21,179
Get better, okay?
Your job is to get well.

1571
01:50:21,247 --> 01:50:24,478
Mr. Modell,
you don't understand.

1572
01:50:25,552 --> 01:50:28,282
Everything I got is
because of football.

1573
01:50:31,958 --> 01:50:33,789
I need to play.

1574
01:50:33,860 --> 01:50:34,884
Yeah.

1575
01:50:34,961 --> 01:50:37,862
Mr. Modell, please, sir.

1576
01:50:39,866 --> 01:50:43,825
Next year, kid. We're counting
on you next year. Really.

1577
01:51:33,386 --> 01:51:34,751
Thank you.

1578
01:51:36,322 --> 01:51:37,914
Thank you, sir.

1579
01:51:39,092 --> 01:51:41,925
Did you hear back from
the teaching job yet?

1580
01:51:44,064 --> 01:51:45,053
Well?

1581
01:51:45,131 --> 01:51:46,621
They offered it to me.

1582
01:51:47,200 --> 01:51:48,690
That's great.

1583
01:51:49,269 --> 01:51:50,793
I told them I had
to think about it.

1584
01:51:50,870 --> 01:51:52,770
What's to think about?

1585
01:51:52,839 --> 01:51:56,172
The distance between
Cleveland and Oakland for one.

1586
01:51:57,577 --> 01:51:58,874
Take it.

1587
01:52:00,213 --> 01:52:01,339
What?

1588
01:52:02,582 --> 01:52:04,675
Take the job, Sarah.

1589
01:52:04,751 --> 01:52:07,117
You've always said you want
to do something with your life.

1590
01:52:07,187 --> 01:52:09,815
You didn't just come to
school just to find a husband.

1591
01:52:09,889 --> 01:52:12,983
You're beautiful, smart.

1592
01:52:14,461 --> 01:52:16,486
Stick to that dream.

1593
01:52:18,264 --> 01:52:20,255
How sick are you, Ernie?

1594
01:52:23,503 --> 01:52:24,902
Look at me.

1595
01:52:33,379 --> 01:52:34,676
Sarah...

1596
01:52:36,249 --> 01:52:37,682
Ernie Davis?

1597
01:52:38,284 --> 01:52:43,085
I hate to disturb you, but would
you sign an autograph for my son?

1598
01:52:43,156 --> 01:52:45,886
He's 12, and you're
his favorite player.

1599
01:52:47,427 --> 01:52:50,294
Gonna be great to see
you with the Browns.

1600
01:52:55,668 --> 01:52:56,657
Thank you.

1601
01:52:56,736 --> 01:52:57,828
You're welcome.

1602
01:53:08,281 --> 01:53:09,578
<i>Leukemia.</i>

1603
01:53:12,152 --> 01:53:16,680
<i>It's a word that
jumps out at you.</i>

1604
01:53:18,191 --> 01:53:20,853
<i>I know when I first
heard it myself,</i>

1605
01:53:22,128 --> 01:53:23,390
<i>I was...</i>

1606
01:53:23,830 --> 01:53:25,320
<i>I was scared.</i>

1607
01:53:26,533 --> 01:53:29,127
<i>But I got a lot of
people in my corner,</i>

1608
01:53:30,804 --> 01:53:32,237
<i>good people,</i>

1609
01:53:34,107 --> 01:53:35,870
<i>standing beside me.</i>

1610
01:53:37,777 --> 01:53:39,972
<i>My doctors are confident.</i>

1611
01:53:40,480 --> 01:53:43,608
<i>They tell me I'm responding
well to my treatment.</i>

1612
01:53:44,384 --> 01:53:47,319
<i>So, things are good.</i>

1613
01:53:50,824 --> 01:53:54,885
<i>And you know me. I'm an
optimist. I'm gonna fight it.</i>

1614
01:53:56,763 --> 01:54:01,132
<i>I hope to get on that field and see
you all in that press box real soon.</i>

1615
01:54:02,569 --> 01:54:03,934
<i>Real soon.</i>

1616
01:54:12,645 --> 01:54:15,546
<i>Mr. Davis, Tom Martin,
Saturday Evening Post.</i>

1617
01:54:15,615 --> 01:54:17,606
I saw you play in the
Cotton Bowl two years ago.

1618
01:54:17,684 --> 01:54:18,708
Okay.

1619
01:54:18,785 --> 01:54:21,481
I'm wondering if you'd like
to write an article for us.

1620
01:54:21,554 --> 01:54:22,987
You want me to
write an article?

1621
01:54:23,056 --> 01:54:24,580
<i>I don't know whether
you know this,</i>

1622
01:54:24,657 --> 01:54:28,218
<i>but you're an inspiration
to a lot of our readers.</i>

1623
01:54:34,400 --> 01:54:36,994
There he is,
number 77.

1624
01:54:37,070 --> 01:54:38,799
He's as good as me?

1625
01:54:40,173 --> 01:54:41,663
Maybe better.

1626
01:54:57,056 --> 01:54:58,455
Hey, Ernie.

1627
01:54:59,292 --> 01:55:01,487
Ernie, this is Floyd Little.
Floyd, this is...

1628
01:55:01,561 --> 01:55:03,426
Ernie Davis.

1629
01:55:03,496 --> 01:55:06,397
2,386 yards,
360 carries,

1630
01:55:06,466 --> 01:55:08,331
6.6 yards a carry.

1631
01:55:08,401 --> 01:55:09,766
You good at math, huh?

1632
01:55:18,544 --> 01:55:22,071
You see, my plan
is to be just like you,

1633
01:55:23,082 --> 01:55:25,983
best Negro running
back in the NCAA,

1634
01:55:26,052 --> 01:55:28,486
Heisman Trophy
all the way.

1635
01:55:28,554 --> 01:55:30,852
Then the NFL,
make some money.

1636
01:55:32,659 --> 01:55:35,321
You got it all
figured out, don't you?

1637
01:55:47,140 --> 01:55:49,973
What kind of bottle
do you think this is?

1638
01:55:50,643 --> 01:55:52,804
Don't know.
Don't have a label.

1639
01:55:52,879 --> 01:55:53,868
Right.

1640
01:55:54,881 --> 01:55:57,008
It could be a soda bottle,

1641
01:55:57,083 --> 01:55:59,108
it could be a beer bottle,
it could be anything.

1642
01:55:59,185 --> 01:56:00,482
No label.

1643
01:56:02,255 --> 01:56:05,554
You see, I never set out to be
the best Negro running back.

1644
01:56:05,625 --> 01:56:07,855
I just wanted to be
the best running back.

1645
01:56:07,927 --> 01:56:10,623
The best football player
I could be. Period.

1646
01:56:12,465 --> 01:56:14,456
Look, now I'm...

1647
01:56:20,840 --> 01:56:23,741
Floyd, I'm never gonna
play for Cleveland.

1648
01:56:26,879 --> 01:56:28,642
Or any other team.

1649
01:56:30,783 --> 01:56:33,343
My playing days are over.

1650
01:56:36,089 --> 01:56:39,024
So don't you look at that poster
of me on your wall and tell me

1651
01:56:39,092 --> 01:56:42,255
you want to be like me,
because that isn't enough.

1652
01:56:42,795 --> 01:56:45,628
You're gonna have to
do better than that.

1653
01:56:48,167 --> 01:56:49,896
You think you can?

1654
01:56:51,604 --> 01:56:52,901
Yes, sir.

1655
01:56:56,242 --> 01:56:57,368
Good.

1656
01:56:59,579 --> 01:57:04,243
But the thing is, I told Notre
Dame I would sign with them.

1657
01:57:08,688 --> 01:57:12,522
Floyd, you know how Notre
Dame loves their passing game.

1658
01:57:12,592 --> 01:57:14,992
My fear is a talented
runner like yourself

1659
01:57:15,061 --> 01:57:17,962
may get stuck polishing that
Notre Dame bench with your butt.

1660
01:57:18,031 --> 01:57:19,794
You don't want that.

1661
01:58:00,173 --> 01:58:02,368
I want to know something.

1662
01:58:02,442 --> 01:58:03,602
Coach?

1663
01:58:03,676 --> 01:58:06,474
What the hell did you
say to Floyd Little?

1664
01:58:06,546 --> 01:58:08,036
Why? What happened?

1665
01:58:08,114 --> 01:58:11,015
Well, I'll be damned,
he backed out on Notre Dame.

1666
01:58:11,084 --> 01:58:13,052
He's coming to Syracuse.

1667
01:58:14,420 --> 01:58:17,912
Well, let's see. I told him
you like your runners lazy,

1668
01:58:18,858 --> 01:58:20,291
and you like players
who backtalk.

1669
01:58:20,359 --> 01:58:21,519
Mmm-hmm.

1670
01:58:21,594 --> 01:58:23,118
Anything else?

1671
01:58:26,966 --> 01:58:29,400
I told him you
were a good coach.

1672
01:58:33,673 --> 01:58:35,436
I'm not gonna
lie to him, Ernie,

1673
01:58:35,508 --> 01:58:38,136
because I know how hard
it's gonna be for him.

1674
01:58:38,211 --> 01:58:40,577
And I promise,
if he works hard,

1675
01:58:42,014 --> 01:58:46,110
he can run for that end zone whether
he's in Boston or Mississippi.

1676
01:58:48,888 --> 01:58:52,221
And I won't tell him that
he's the next Ernie Davis,

1677
01:58:53,092 --> 01:58:56,027
because there won't
be another Ernie Davis.

1678
01:59:12,845 --> 01:59:17,179
Can you believe they suited me up
to run on the field and take a bow?

1679
01:59:19,118 --> 01:59:20,312
I'll be right
here with you, son.

1680
01:59:20,386 --> 01:59:21,546
<i>Please
welcome to the field,</i>

1681
01:59:21,621 --> 01:59:27,287
<i>number 45, from Syracuse
at halfback, Ernie Davis.</i>

1682
01:59:36,002 --> 01:59:39,233
<i>Mr. Martin, in the end
it turns out you did me a favor</i>

1683
01:59:39,305 --> 01:59:42,240
<i>when you asked me to
write this for The Post.</i>

1684
01:59:45,845 --> 01:59:48,507
<i>You see, yesterday
was my 23rd birthday,</i>

1685
01:59:48,581 --> 01:59:53,348
<i>and compared to some, that doesn't seem
like a whole lot of life to talk about.</i>

1686
01:59:59,058 --> 02:00:03,324
<i>Thing is, I don't know how
much more is in front of me.</i>

1687
02:00:03,396 --> 02:00:07,389
<i>And as you see from the number
of pages, if you've read this far,</i>

1688
02:00:07,466 --> 02:00:11,926
<i>I did have a few things to say,
and I'm not sure how to end this</i>

1689
02:00:12,004 --> 02:00:13,938
<i>or even if I want to.</i>

1690
02:00:15,174 --> 02:00:19,270
<i>It's funny. Most people think my
life has been all about football.</i>

1691
02:00:20,746 --> 02:00:23,010
<i>I've even thought
that myself.</i>

1692
02:00:23,716 --> 02:00:25,843
<i>But football is just a game.</i>

1693
02:00:26,752 --> 02:00:29,186
<i>What matters is
what you play for.</i>

1694
02:00:36,796 --> 02:00:40,994
<i>Sometimes, when the game is close
and everything is on the line,</i>

1695
02:00:41,067 --> 02:00:44,127
<i>that's when you forget
the crowd and the noise.</i>

1696
02:00:45,805 --> 02:00:50,504
<i>That's when it's just you against
somebody else to see who is the better man.</i>

1697
02:00:51,577 --> 02:00:54,011
<i>That's what I like about the game.</i>

1698
02:00:54,647 --> 02:00:57,741
<i>Because at that
moment you are friends</i>

1699
02:00:59,485 --> 02:01:01,214
<i>and you are enemies</i>

1700
02:01:04,023 --> 02:01:05,820
<i>and you are brothers.</i>
