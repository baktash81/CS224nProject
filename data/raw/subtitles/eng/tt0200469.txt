growin' up back in Ohio,

366

we, uh, had a barn.

give me these horrific nightmares.

dad finally dragged me out back

all the good things bats do.

00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,662

00:46:05,103 --> 00:46:07,456
and foxhole in a
100-mile radius of Gallup.

706
00:46:07,498 --> 00:46:09,767
What? Are they crazy?

707
00:46:09,835 --> 00:46:13,171
They'll kill every living thing in
Gallup county and not a single bat.

708
00:46:13,238 --> 00:46:16,107
That's right, and we cannot
let them do that.

709
00:46:16,174 --> 00:46:19,244
Now, I begged them
for this chance and...

710
00:46:19,310 --> 00:46:22,948
Well,
they agreed but we're basically on our own.

711
00:46:23,014 --> 00:46:24,916
I tell you, I'm not gonna
let 'em blow my town

712
00:46:24,983 --> 00:46:27,561
off the face of the earth without a
fight. People got their homes here.

713
00:46:27,585 --> 00:46:29,487
Hell, they got
their whole lives here.

714
00:46:29,554 --> 00:46:31,874
It's my job to make sure they
got somethin' to come back to.

715
00:46:31,923 --> 00:46:34,725
The reality is we're sure to be
quarantined for the next month,

716
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:36,127
whether we stay or not.

717
00:46:36,194 --> 00:46:37,528
What? He's stayin', too?

718
00:46:38,830 --> 00:46:40,365
I created them.

719
00:46:43,334 --> 00:46:46,637
This will give me time
to review my work

720
00:46:46,704 --> 00:46:48,573
and figure out what went wrong.

721
00:46:50,308 --> 00:46:52,010
Jimmy, we could really
use your help.

722
00:46:53,511 --> 00:46:55,646
But I would understand if
you don't wanna hang around.

723
00:46:59,918 --> 00:47:02,553
Well, let me tell you one thing.

724
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:05,556
If another one of your bats
looks at me,

725
00:47:05,623 --> 00:47:07,225
if his head starts movin'
like this,

726
00:47:07,292 --> 00:47:10,395
or his eyes start goin' like this,
like he might even look at me,

727
00:47:10,461 --> 00:47:11,662
I'm comin' for you.

728
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:16,367
Does that mean
you're gonna stay?

729
00:47:16,434 --> 00:47:19,570
Yeah, I'll stay.

730
00:47:22,273 --> 00:47:24,809
Somethin' called a Chroma B340.

731
00:47:24,876 --> 00:47:26,878
It's the newest thing
in spy satellites.

732
00:47:26,945 --> 00:47:28,679
When the satellite
passes over Texas,

733
00:47:28,746 --> 00:47:30,648
they're gonna center
their infrared cameras

734
00:47:30,715 --> 00:47:34,785
on a 50-mile radius just south
of Gallup. Give us a direct feed.

735
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:36,430
Now, when the bats emerge
from their roost,

736
00:47:36,454 --> 00:47:38,423
it's gonna be your turn, Sheila.

737
00:47:38,489 --> 00:47:41,626
See, the military, they, uh, wanna
be as hands-off about this as possible.

738
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:43,092
So you're gonna have
to make the ID.

739
00:47:43,128 --> 00:47:44,362
You figure you can do that?

740
00:47:44,996 --> 00:47:46,231
I can try.

741
00:47:53,471 --> 00:47:55,240
KIMSEY: This is our school.

742
00:47:55,306 --> 00:47:58,109
It's not as primitive as you
might think for a one-horse town.

743
00:47:58,176 --> 00:48:00,311
But I figure we can
fortify it as good as any.

744
00:48:00,378 --> 00:48:01,579
SHEILA: Let's hope so.

745
00:48:12,023 --> 00:48:14,235
All right, Jimmy, you can set
up in here. It's the science room.

746
00:48:14,259 --> 00:48:15,869
All the computers are rigged
with high-speed modems.

747
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:18,163
See if you can't hook us up
to Langley.

748
00:48:18,229 --> 00:48:20,465
We should secure the building
before it gets dark.

749
00:48:20,531 --> 00:48:21,899
I heard that.

That is Montserrat singin'
Donizetti's Lucia.

753

It's one of the real touchstones
of the whole Bel Canto repertoire.

754
00:49:12,383 --> 00:49:15,420
Oh, you're an opera fan,
Sheriff. I'm impressed.

755
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:32,003
Don't tell anybody
about my hidden vice.

756
00:49:32,070 --> 00:49:34,815
Around here, folks would run my
ass out of town on a rail if they knew.

Don't worry.
Your secret's safe with me.

760
00:49:46,517 --> 00:49:47,552
Get out!

761
00:51:02,793 --> 00:51:05,963
There. We are now as secure
as the god damn Alamo.

762
00:51:08,499 --> 00:51:09,867
Bad example there, Jimmy.

763
00:51:10,668 --> 00:51:12,570
Oh, right.

764
00:51:12,637 --> 00:51:15,549
You know, maybe we should hang up a few
cloves of garlic around here or somethin'.

765
00:51:15,573 --> 00:51:16,774
What do you think?

766
00:51:21,779 --> 00:51:23,448
I got hooked up to the base.

767
00:51:23,514 --> 00:51:24,915
Once the satellite passes over

768
00:51:24,982 --> 00:51:26,260
they'll start sendin' us
a stream of photos.

769
00:51:26,284 --> 00:51:27,885
That'll work.

770
00:51:27,952 --> 00:51:29,554
And once we find 'em, then what?

771
00:51:32,290 --> 00:51:35,893
Well, let's assume they're
all living in the same roost.

772
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:38,040
Given their communal behavior,
I'd say that's likely.

773
00:51:39,197 --> 00:51:40,665
Poison?

774
00:51:40,731 --> 00:51:44,068
Not an option. The most popular
poison for bats is Chlorophacinone.

775
00:51:44,135 --> 00:51:47,172
Largely ineffective against
them and highly lethal for humans.

776
00:51:47,238 --> 00:51:50,007
Believe me, I've checked
into this a long time ago.

777
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:54,645
Maybe if we try and trap 'em?

778
00:51:54,712 --> 00:51:56,757
Well, whatever we do, we're gonna
have to make sure we get all of 'em.

779
00:51:56,781 --> 00:51:58,483
Why don't we just bomb
the sons of bitches?

780
00:51:58,549 --> 00:52:00,451
No, no, no.

781
00:52:00,518 --> 00:52:02,653
An explosion would
definitely scatter them

782
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,855
and given the potential
complexity of the roost system,

783
00:52:04,922 --> 00:52:06,267
it might not even kill
all that many.

784
00:52:06,291 --> 00:52:07,958
This is like
some kind of a nightmare.

785
00:52:08,025 --> 00:52:09,294
I mean, I'll never sleep again.

786
00:52:10,528 --> 00:52:11,962
Wait a minute.

787
00:52:12,029 --> 00:52:13,130
That's it.

788
00:52:13,198 --> 00:52:14,265
What?

789
00:52:14,332 --> 00:52:16,100
We'll put them to sleep.

790
00:52:18,068 --> 00:52:21,339
When the temperature drops below
40 degrees, bats begin to hibernate.

791
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:24,309
But at 32,

792
00:52:26,711 --> 00:52:27,878
they'll freeze to death.

793
00:52:27,945 --> 00:52:29,547
(SCOFFS) Right,
but how do we do it?

794
00:52:29,614 --> 00:52:31,816
Yeah, especially in the
middle of a heat wave.

795
00:52:31,882 --> 00:52:34,685
All we need are cooling units
powerful enough to freeze the roost.

796
00:52:36,721 --> 00:52:38,289
Well, all right.

797
00:52:38,356 --> 00:52:39,600
Jimmy, get on the horn
to Langley.

798
00:52:39,624 --> 00:52:40,891
See what they can come up with.

799
00:52:40,958 --> 00:52:42,227
I'll check it out.

800
00:52:44,795 --> 00:52:46,130
Hey, Sheila?

801
00:52:48,899 --> 00:52:51,044
Seems to me, you're thinkin'
about walking into that roost

802
00:52:51,068 --> 00:52:53,480
with a whole lot of those damn
things hangin' right over your head.

803
00:52:53,504 --> 00:52:55,406
Uh, no, you see,
bats are nocturnal.

804
00:52:55,473 --> 00:52:56,907
We go in there
during the day and...

805
00:52:56,974 --> 00:52:58,519
Yeah, but those are normal
bats you're talkin' about.

806
00:52:58,543 --> 00:52:59,944
I mean, these... I know.

807
00:53:01,111 --> 00:53:02,747
We don't have any other choice.

808
00:53:34,412 --> 00:53:37,882
Yeah. Yeah, I got it.

809
00:53:37,948 --> 00:53:40,385
All right, boys and girls,
we are all set.

810
00:53:40,451 --> 00:53:43,120
They have something called
the NGIC Industrial,

811
00:53:43,187 --> 00:53:47,024
a cooler that emits a combination of Freon,
CO2 and pure oxygen

812
00:53:47,091 --> 00:53:48,626
at superhuman velocity.

813
00:53:48,693 --> 00:53:51,462

in icicles in three days.

814
00:53:51,529 --> 00:53:52,863

JIMMY: Now,
once we've located the roost,

816
00:53:54,665 --> 00:53:57,435
they said they'll do an airlift
and drop-off at the entrance.

817
00:53:57,502 --> 00:53:58,936
But that's as far
as they will go.

818
00:53:59,003 --> 00:54:00,638
They don't even wanna
know about us.

819
00:54:00,705 --> 00:54:02,640
Right now, they're preparing
for a bombing raid.

820

All right, we're gonna need
some special gear to go in.
