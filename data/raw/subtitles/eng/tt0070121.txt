1
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:24,793
<i>My name is known:</i>

2
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,698
<i>God and King.</i>

3
00:00:27,093 --> 00:00:32,042
<i>I am most in majesty in whom
no beginning may be and no end.</i>

4
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:35,939
<i>Highest in potency I am...</i>

5
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:37,877
<i>...and have been ever.</i>

6
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:42,317
<i>I have made stars and planets
in their courses to go.</i>

7
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:45,253
<i>I have made a moon for the night...</i>

8
00:00:45,445 --> 00:00:48,517
<i>...and the sun to light the day also.</i>

9
00:00:49,516 --> 00:00:51,393
<i>I have made earth...</i>

10
00:00:51,584 --> 00:00:54,360
<i>...where trees and grasses spring.</i>

11
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:58,632
<i>Beasts and fowl,
both great and small...</i>

12
00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:01,704
<i>...all thrive and have my liking.</i>

13
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:06,206
<i>I have made all of nothing
for man's sustenation...</i>

14
00:01:06,699 --> 00:01:10,977
<i>...and of this pleasant garden
that I have mostly goodly planted...</i>

15
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:15,376
<i>...I will make him gardener
for his own re-creation.</i>

16
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:34,555
Back it out of there!
Come on! Back it up!

17
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:37,364
Will you back it out of here?

18
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:39,995
What do you say?
I got the right of way.

19
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:43,606
Look at that mess! Come on!
I got the right of way.

20
00:02:43,796 --> 00:02:45,935
Go on, get out of here!

21
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:47,611
Don't just stand there!

22
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:08,494
I ain't got all day,
I got places to go!

23
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:31,612
Come here, come here!

24
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:09,666
What?

25
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,457
<i>Prepare ye</i>

26
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:41,161
<i>The way of the Lord</i>

27
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:45,637
<i>Prepare ye</i>

28
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:51,476
<i>The way of the Lord</i>

29
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,581
Hey, Merrell!
Where you going?

30
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:26,949
<i>Prepare ye</i>

31
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:31,054
<i>The way of the Lord</i>

32
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:16,931
<i>Everybody now!</i>

33
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:43,491
<i>Everybody now!</i>

34
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:06,015
I baptize you with water
for repentance...

35
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:09,118
...but He that comes after me
is mightier than I.

36
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:12,255
I'm not fit to take off His shoes.

37
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,482
And He will baptize you all...

38
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:18,822
...with the Holy Spirit and with fire!

39
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:27,368
You come to me?

40
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:31,068
I want to get washed up.

41
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,141
I would rather be baptized by you.

42
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:42,444
No, we do well now to conform
with all that God requires.

43
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:51,822
<i>When wilt thou save the people</i>

44
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:54,589
<i>O God of mercy, when?</i>

45
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,300
<i>The people, Lord, the people</i>

46
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,470
<i>Not thrones and crowns</i>

47
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,900
<i>But men</i>

48
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:05,372
<i>Flowers of Thy heart</i>

49
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:07,578
<i>O God, are they</i>

50
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:09,642
<i>Let them not pass</i>

51
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:12,941
<i>Like weeds away</i>

52
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:15,276
<i>Their heritage</i>

53
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:17,910
<i>A sunless day</i>

54
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,558
<i>God save the people</i>

55
00:11:25,217 --> 00:11:27,493
<i>Shall crime bring crime forever</i>

56
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:30,527
<i>Strength aiding still the strong</i>

57
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:33,260
<i>Is it Thy will, O Father</i>

58
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:36,702
<i>That men shall toil for wrong?</i>

59
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:41,201
<i>Oh no, say Thy mountains</i>

60
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,006
<i>No, say Thy skies</i>

61
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:48,674
<i>Man's clouded sun shall brightly rise</i>

62
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:51,580
<i>And songs be heard</i>

63
00:11:51,777 --> 00:11:53,779
<i>Instead of sighs</i>

64
00:11:55,781 --> 00:12:00,230
<i>God save the people</i>

65
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,487
<i>When wilt Thou save the people</i>

66
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:32,924
<i>O God of mercy, when?</i>

67
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:35,325
<i>The people, Lord, the people</i>

68
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:37,091
<i>Not thrones and crowns</i>

69
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:39,895
<i>But men</i>

70
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:42,265
<i>God save the people</i>

71
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:44,537
<i>For Thine they are</i>

72
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:49,012
<i>Thy children as Thy angels fair</i>

73
00:12:49,468 --> 00:12:53,006
<i>God save the people
From despair</i>

74
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:58,112
<i>God save the people</i>

75
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:02,983
<i>God save the people</i>

76
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:17,674
<i>When wilt Thou save the people</i>

77
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:21,902
<i>O God of mercy, when?</i>

78
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:25,207
<i>The people, Lord, the people</i>

79
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:27,911
<i>Not thrones and crowns</i>

80
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:30,050
<i>But men</i>

81
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:32,688
<i>God save the people</i>

82
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:35,690
<i>O Thine they are</i>

83
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:38,856
<i>Thy children as Thy angels fair</i>

84
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,291
<i>God save the people
From despair</i>

85
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:34,607
- Let's go!
- Look at this!

86
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:37,986
Look at that car!

87
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:50,832
Watch the birdy.

88
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:53,502
Leaving so soon?

89
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,272
Wake me at 6...

90
00:14:57,463 --> 00:14:59,807
...for tea and biscuits.
Make that noon.

91
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:13,487
Who is it?

92
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:15,291
I said noon!

93
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:20,622
Come here, come here!

94
00:15:21,987 --> 00:15:23,933
Oh, boy. Look!

95
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:28,196
Here. See if it fits.

96
00:15:37,202 --> 00:15:42,083
Now, do not suppose that I have come
to abolish the Law and the prophets.

97
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,220
I did not come to abolish...

98
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,117
...but to complete.

99
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:05,565
I tell you this :

100
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,608
So long as Heaven
and earth endure...

101
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:10,974
...not a letter...

102
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:14,375
...not a stroke will disappear
from the Law...

103
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,916
...until all that must happen
has happened.

104
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,619
If any man, therefore...

105
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:23,726
...sets aside even the least
of the Law's demands...

106
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:26,889
...he will have the lowest place...

107
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:29,698
...in the kingdom of Heaven.

108
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:33,665
But he who keeps the Law...

109
00:16:33,859 --> 00:16:35,668
...and teaches others so...

110
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:42,669
...he will have the highest place
in the kingdom of Heaven.

111
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:51,416
Unless you show yourselves to be
far better than the Pharisees...

112
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:53,590
...and the doctors of the Law...

113
00:16:53,979 --> 00:16:56,619
...you shall never enter
the kingdom of Heaven.

114
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:04,123
Amen!

115
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:09,897
Brothers and sisters
gather around...

116
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,762
...because two men...

117
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:15,130
...I said two, went off to
the temple to pray.

118
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:17,866
One, a Pharisee...

119
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,904
...and the other...

120
00:18:23,168 --> 00:18:24,875
...a tax gatherer.

121
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:31,848
While the Pharisee, he just stood
right on up and prayed thus:

122
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:35,024
I thank Thee, O God,
that I am not like other men.

123
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:38,761
Greedy, dishonest, adulterous...

124
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:41,328
...or for that matter,
like that tax gatherer.

125
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,330
I pray twice a week.
Get that? Twice a week!

126
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:46,594
And pay taxes on all that I get.

127
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:50,569
But the other kept his distance...

128
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:54,777
...and would not even raise his eyes
to the good Lord in Heaven.

129
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:57,347
- I said, "The good Lord in Heaven"!
- Amen!

130
00:18:57,536 --> 00:19:00,483
But beat upon his breast, saying :

131
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:02,947
"Oh, God, have mercy on me...

132
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,485
...sinner that I am."

133
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:07,821
And it was this man, I tell you--

134
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:10,622
You've got to be kidding!

135
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:13,557
And not the other, who went off
and quitted of his sins.

136
00:19:13,752 --> 00:19:16,665
For every man who exalts himself...

137
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:19,262
...shall be humbled.

138
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:23,764
But every man who humbles himself...

139
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,772
Shall be...

140
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:31,973
...exalted!

141
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:35,279
What if your brother sues you?

142
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:37,214
You better settle with him quickly.

143
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:40,249
- Or he'll hand you over to the judge.
- Guilty!

144
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:42,288
And the judge to the constable...

145
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:44,324
...and you'll land in jail!

146
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:47,488
Let me out of here!

147
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:48,892
I tell you...

148
00:19:49,087 --> 00:19:52,591
...you'll not get out of there
until you've paid the last penny.

149
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:01,241
<i>There once was a king</i>

150
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:04,608
<i>Who decided to settle accounts</i>

151
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:06,441
<i>With the men who served him</i>

152
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,520
<i>At the outset
There appeared before the master</i>

153
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,848
<i>A man whose debt
Ran into the millions</i>

154
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,422
<i>I said the millions</i>

155
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:16,785
<i>Since the man had no means of paying</i>

156
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:19,292
<i>The master ordered him to be sold
To meet the debt</i>

157
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:21,828
<i>With his wife
And his child</i>

158
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,090
<i>And everything he had</i>

159
00:20:23,288 --> 00:20:27,100
<i>The man threw himself
Down at the master's feet and went:</i>

160
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:31,338
- Be patient with me.
- He said.

161
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,476
And I shall pay in full.

162
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:36,111
And so moved with pity
was the master...

163
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:38,346
...that he decided to free the man...

164
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:42,041
...and remit the debt.
And let's hear it for the master!

165
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:45,552
Give me an M!
Give me an A-S-T-E-R!

166
00:20:46,945 --> 00:20:48,754
Yay, master!

167
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,728
Wait a minute.

168
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,857
No sooner had he been released...

169
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:56,794
...that he met a servant
who owed him a few dollars.

170
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:59,526
He gripped him by
the throat and said :

171
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:02,763
Pay me! I says pay me
what you owes me!

172
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:06,534
The man fell at his fellow servant's
feet and begged him, saying:

173
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:10,041
Please, please be patient with me.

174
00:21:10,235 --> 00:21:12,044
I shall pay you.

175
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,682
But he refused, saying :

176
00:21:13,872 --> 00:21:14,942
Look!

177
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:19,781
And had him jailed
until he should pay.

178
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:25,419
Well, the other servants
were deeply distressed...

179
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:27,927
...when they saw what had happened.

180
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:31,098
Are you sitting down?

181
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:34,396
They ran and told their master
the whole story.

182
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:41,204
Accordingly, he sent for the man.

183
00:21:46,938 --> 00:21:48,076
You scoundrel!

184
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,308
He said to him.

185
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:52,818
I remitted the whole of your debt
when you appealed to me.

186
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:57,585
Were you not bound to show your fellow
servant the same pity I show to you?

187
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:04,496
And so angry was the master...

188
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:08,765
...that he condemned the man
to torture...

189
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:11,405
...until he could pay...

190
00:22:11,596 --> 00:22:13,906
...the debt in full.

191
00:22:26,378 --> 00:22:29,382
And that is how my Heavenly Father
will deal with you...

192
00:22:29,581 --> 00:22:31,959
...unless you forgive your brothers
from your hearts.

193
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,562
Master.

You have heard, "An eye for an eye
and a tooth for a tooth."

221
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:00,793
But what I tell you is this :

222
00:26:00,992 --> 00:26:03,598
Never set yourself against
the man who wrongs you.

223
00:26:03,795 --> 00:26:06,173
So if someone slaps you
on your right cheek...

224
00:26:06,364 --> 00:26:08,366
...turn and offer him your left.

225
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:10,835
Oh, Jesus Chr--

226
00:26:12,871 --> 00:26:15,044
Slowly I turn...

227
00:26:15,707 --> 00:26:17,448
...step by step...

228
00:26:17,876 --> 00:26:19,651
...inch by inch.

229
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:32,560
It's for you.

230
00:26:33,825 --> 00:26:35,361
No, I didn't think so.

231
00:26:50,175 --> 00:26:53,315
Now, when the Son of Man
comes in all His glory...

232
00:26:53,511 --> 00:26:55,388
...with all His angels with Him...

233
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:58,060
...He will sit in state
upon His throne...

234
00:26:58,249 --> 00:27:01,093
...with all the nations
gathered before Him.

235
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,429
He'll separate the men
into two groups...

236
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:06,068
...as a shepherd separates
the sheep from the goats.

237
00:27:06,257 --> 00:27:07,930
He'll put the sheep on His right...

238
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:10,003
...and the goats on His left.

239
00:27:11,529 --> 00:27:12,667
Over there.

240
00:27:18,036 --> 00:27:19,344
Sheep on His right.

241
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:22,448
The sheep on His right. I see.

242
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:24,484
Thank you.

243
00:27:25,543 --> 00:27:27,989
And then He will say
to those on His right:

244
00:27:28,346 --> 00:27:29,347
Sheep...

245
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:32,427
-...you have my Father's blessing.
- Oh, wonderful!

246
00:27:32,617 --> 00:27:35,860
Enter the kingdom that's been
ready since the world was made.

247
00:27:36,054 --> 00:27:38,125
For when I was hungry,
you gave me food.

248
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:40,633
When I was thirsty,
you gave me drink.

249
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:43,772
When I was naked and without a home,
you took me in.

250
00:27:43,962 --> 00:27:47,842
And when I was ill and in prison,
you came to my aid.

251
00:27:52,937 --> 00:27:53,779
Sorry.

252
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:55,541
No goats.

253
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:56,650
Baloney!

254
00:27:58,109 --> 00:27:59,417
Then they will say to Him :

255
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:03,184
Master, when was it that we saw
youse hungry and gave youse food...

256
00:28:03,381 --> 00:28:05,361
...or thirsty and gave youse drink?

257
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:08,224
Yeah!
Or in prison and helped you?

258
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:09,797
And He will say to them :

259
00:28:10,121 --> 00:28:12,294
"Anything you did
for one of your brothers...

260
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:15,403
...however humble, you did for me."

261
00:28:16,394 --> 00:28:17,873
I get it!

262
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:21,137
And He will say to them :

263
00:28:22,567 --> 00:28:24,911
A curse is upon you!

264
00:28:26,571 --> 00:28:27,572
Then they'll say to Him :

265
00:28:27,772 --> 00:28:30,013
Big boy, if we'd have
known it was you...

266
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:33,815
...we would've taken you around
the corner for a cup of coffee.

267
00:28:36,281 --> 00:28:37,658
And He will say to them :

268
00:28:37,849 --> 00:28:41,991
"Anything you did not do for one of
your brothers, however humble...

269
00:28:42,187 --> 00:28:44,224
...you did not do for me."

270
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:49,237
And then they will take their place
in eternal punishment.

271
00:28:49,828 --> 00:28:52,866
But the righteous
shall have eternal life!

272
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:54,236
Come on!

273
00:29:06,778 --> 00:29:07,779
Come on.

274
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:22,770
<i>The lamp...</i>

<i>...is the eye.</i>

277
00:29:26,131 --> 00:29:27,405
<i>If your eye...</i>

<i>...is darkness...</i>

Hey, I can't see!

296
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:04,774
- What's the matter?
- I got my eyes shut.

297
00:30:06,037 --> 00:30:09,018
Now, no servant can be
the slave of two masters.

298
00:30:09,607 --> 00:30:13,214
Either he will love the first
and think nothing of the second...

299
00:30:13,411 --> 00:30:16,824
...or be devoted to the second
and hate the first.

300
00:30:17,715 --> 00:30:19,752
No man can serve God...

301
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,631
...and money.

365
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:53,895
<i>...foolish...</i>

366
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:56,231
<i>...ways</i>

367
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:04,678
Play it, honey!

368
00:35:11,742 --> 00:35:14,882
A man was on his way
from Jerusalem to Jericho...

369
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:19,793
...when he fell among robbers...

370
00:35:21,419 --> 00:35:22,625
...who beat him...

371
00:35:23,554 --> 00:35:25,397
...stripped him...

372
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:29,365
...and left...

373
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,096
...leaving him half-dead.

374
00:35:33,164 --> 00:35:36,611
It so happened
a priest came upon him.

375
00:35:40,738 --> 00:35:44,914
But when he saw him,
he went past on the other side.

376
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:50,190
So too, a judge...

377
00:35:50,381 --> 00:35:52,088
...came to the place...

378
00:35:54,886 --> 00:35:56,331
...and saw him...

379
00:35:56,521 --> 00:35:59,468
...and he went past
on the other side.

380
00:36:05,696 --> 00:36:06,606
But...

381
00:36:07,098 --> 00:36:10,477
...a Samaritan was making the journey.

382
00:36:21,112 --> 00:36:23,683
He came upon him,
and when he saw him...

383
00:36:24,148 --> 00:36:26,560
...he was moved to pity.

384
00:36:26,918 --> 00:36:29,524
He went up and bandaged his wounds...

385
00:36:34,825 --> 00:36:37,738
...bathing them in oil and wine.

386
00:36:43,768 --> 00:36:46,942
Then he put him onto his own beast
and brought him to an inn...

387
00:36:47,138 --> 00:36:49,709
...and looked after him there.

388
00:36:50,474 --> 00:36:53,512
The next day, he produced
two pieces of silver...

389
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:56,885
...and gave them to the innkeeper
and said:

390
00:36:57,415 --> 00:36:59,053
"Look after him...

391
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:01,059
...and if you spend any more...

392
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:04,395
...I will repay on my way back."

393
00:37:16,167 --> 00:37:17,441
Bravo!

394
00:37:44,795 --> 00:37:48,675
When you do some act of charity,
don't announce it with trumpets...

395
00:37:48,866 --> 00:37:51,847
...as the heathen do in synagogues
and in the streets.

396
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:55,347
I tell you, they do it
just to win admiration from men.

397
00:37:56,207 --> 00:37:58,915
No, when you do
some act of charity...

398
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,181
...don't let your right hand know...

399
00:38:01,379 --> 00:38:03,325
...what your left hand is doing.

400
00:38:04,649 --> 00:38:05,389
Look at that!

401
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:09,258
Your good deed must be in secret.

402
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:17,568
It's a secret.

403
00:38:18,896 --> 00:38:22,366
What the good Master is telling us
is that up in Heaven...

404
00:38:22,566 --> 00:38:26,742
...there's about 100 million
tiny angels about yea-by-yea...

405
00:38:26,937 --> 00:38:28,507
...and they all take shorthand.

406
00:38:28,706 --> 00:38:31,619
Every time you do something silly,
they write it in--

407
00:38:32,243 --> 00:38:34,746
That's not what the good Master
is telling us.

408
00:38:34,945 --> 00:38:38,757
Your Heavenly Father,
who sees what is done in secret...

409
00:38:38,949 --> 00:38:39,859
He will what?

410
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:41,988
Reward you!

411
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,135
Get him some flowers.

412
00:38:51,962 --> 00:38:53,703
Thank you.
Thank you.

413
00:38:54,799 --> 00:38:57,177
There once was
a very rich man...

414
00:38:57,868 --> 00:39:00,747
...who dressed in purple
and the finest linen.

415
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:04,448
Rich man, that's me.

416
00:39:04,642 --> 00:39:06,553
And every day he feasted--

417
00:39:06,744 --> 00:39:08,519
Thank you, thank you...

418
00:39:09,213 --> 00:39:11,318
Feasted in the greatest magnificence.

419
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:13,859
At his gate lay poor Lazarus...

420
00:39:14,051 --> 00:39:18,522
...who would've been glad to eat
the scraps from the rich man's table.

421
00:39:18,723 --> 00:39:21,431
Oh, my God, it's good!
Get out of there.

422
00:39:22,259 --> 00:39:23,704
Even the doggy-doggies...

423
00:39:23,894 --> 00:39:27,398
...used to come to Lazarus
and lick his open, running sores.

424
00:39:27,598 --> 00:39:28,406
Sorry.

425
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:31,478
Well, one day,
the poor man died...

426
00:39:34,472 --> 00:39:37,646
...and was carried away
by the angels to be with Abraham.

427
00:39:47,818 --> 00:39:49,957
The rich man also died...

428
00:39:51,589 --> 00:39:53,227
...and was buried...

429
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,603
...and was sent to Hades...

430
00:40:08,873 --> 00:40:11,012
...where he was in torment.

431
00:40:13,477 --> 00:40:14,854
He looked up...

432
00:40:15,045 --> 00:40:17,924
...and there, far, far away...

433
00:40:18,115 --> 00:40:19,753
...was Abraham...

434
00:40:20,151 --> 00:40:22,927
...with Lazarus close beside him.

435
00:40:28,626 --> 00:40:29,969
Oh, Father Abraham...

436
00:40:30,161 --> 00:40:31,299
...have pity on me.

437
00:40:31,495 --> 00:40:32,838
Send Lazarus to dip...

438
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:36,204
...the tip of his finger
in water to cool my tongue.

439
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:40,507
For I'm in agony in this fire.
Let go of me, will you!

440
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:44,151
Remember, my child, that
all the good things fell to you...

441
00:40:44,341 --> 00:40:45,877
...while you were on earth.

442
00:40:46,177 --> 00:40:48,179
And all the bad to Lois.

443
00:40:48,379 --> 00:40:49,289
Lazarus.

444
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,153
Abraham.
Glad to know you.

445
00:40:51,348 --> 00:40:54,886
And now it is he
who has consolation here...

446
00:40:55,085 --> 00:40:57,998
...and it is you who are in agony.

447
00:40:58,189 --> 00:41:01,830
Then, Father Abraham, send Lazarus
to my father's house...

448
00:41:02,026 --> 00:41:04,438
...where I have five pies--
I mean, brothers...

449
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:05,663
...to warn them...

450
00:41:05,863 --> 00:41:10,812
...so that they too may not come
to this place of torment.

451
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:14,980
They got Moses and the prophets.
Let them listen to them.

452
00:41:15,873 --> 00:41:19,252
But if somebody from the dead
should rise, then they'd listen.

453
00:41:25,616 --> 00:41:26,788
Look.

454
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:29,225
If they don't listen
to Moses and the prophets...

455
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:32,697
...they ain't gonna
listen to nobody.

456
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:36,167
Even if somebody should
rise from the dead.

457
00:41:45,703 --> 00:41:47,910
<i>Oh, bless the Lord, my soul</i>

458
00:41:48,806 --> 00:41:51,412
<i>His grace to thee proclaim</i>

459
00:41:51,976 --> 00:41:56,015
<i>And all that is within rejoin</i>

460
00:41:56,213 --> 00:41:58,989
<i>To bless His holy name</i>

461
00:42:04,755 --> 00:42:07,258
<i>Oh, bless the Lord, my soul</i>

462
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:10,537
<i>His mercies bear in mind</i>

463
00:42:11,095 --> 00:42:15,134
<i>Forget not all His benefits</i>

464
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:18,074
<i>The Lord to thee is kind</i>

465
00:42:19,737 --> 00:42:22,047
<i>He will not always chide</i>

466
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:24,378
<i>He will with patience wait</i>

467
00:42:24,775 --> 00:42:27,619
<i>His wrath is ever slow to rise</i>

468
00:42:30,114 --> 00:42:31,923
<i>And ready to abate</i>

469
00:42:32,616 --> 00:42:34,618
<i>And ready to abate</i>

470
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:36,598
<i>And ready to</i>

471
00:42:38,956 --> 00:42:42,130
<i>And ready to abate</i>

472
00:42:48,098 --> 00:42:50,840
<i>He pardons all thy sins</i>

473
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:53,845
<i>Prolongs thy feeble breath</i>

474
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:59,145
<i>He healeth thine infirmities</i>

475
00:42:59,944 --> 00:43:01,981
<i>And ransoms thee from death</i>

476
00:43:02,313 --> 00:43:04,418
<i>Oh, bless the Lord, my soul</i>

477
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:11,323
<i>He clothes thee with His love</i>

478
00:43:12,122 --> 00:43:14,693
<i>Upholds thee with His truth</i>

479
00:43:15,392 --> 00:43:19,499
<i>And like the eagle He renews</i>

480
00:43:19,997 --> 00:43:22,876
<i>The vigor of thy youth</i>

481
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:26,073
<i>Then bless His holy name</i>

482
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:28,515
<i>Whose grace has made thee whole</i>

483
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:31,377
<i>Whose loving kindness crown</i>

484
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:33,748
<i>Thy days</i>

485
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:37,217
<i>Bless the Lord, my soul</i>

486
00:43:37,581 --> 00:43:39,720
<i>Bless the Lord, my soul</i>

487
00:44:17,788 --> 00:44:19,028
<i>Oh, bless the Lord</i>

488
00:44:20,791 --> 00:44:23,465
<i>My soul</i>

489
00:44:23,794 --> 00:44:25,865
<i>Oh, bless the Lord, my soul</i>

490
00:44:27,264 --> 00:44:28,402
Bravo!

491
00:44:31,402 --> 00:44:32,506
Master!

492
00:44:38,942 --> 00:44:41,718
Master! Blessed are
the poor in spirit.

493
00:44:41,912 --> 00:44:43,550
For theirs is
the kingdom of Heaven.

494
00:44:43,747 --> 00:44:46,626
- Blessed are they who mourn.
- They shall be comforted.

495
00:44:46,817 --> 00:44:49,696
- Blessed are the meek.
- They shall inherit the earth.

496
00:44:49,887 --> 00:44:52,959
- They who hunger for justice.
- They shall be filled.

497
00:44:53,157 --> 00:44:55,330
- The merciful!
- They shall have mercy.

498
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:58,507
- Blessed are the pure in heart.
- They shall see God.

499
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:02,234
- Blessed are the peacemakers!
- They shall be called children of God.

500
00:45:02,466 --> 00:45:05,777
Blessed are those who are persecuted
for righteousness' sake!

501
00:45:05,969 --> 00:45:08,916
For theirs is the kingdom of Heaven!

502
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:11,687
Blessed are ye...

503
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:14,412
...when men shall persecute you
and revile you...

504
00:45:14,611 --> 00:45:16,955
...and say all manner
of evil against you...

505
00:45:18,782 --> 00:45:19,760
...falsely.

506
00:45:35,799 --> 00:45:39,474
Did I ever tell you that
I used to read feet?

507
00:45:41,505 --> 00:45:42,779
You used to what?

508
00:45:42,973 --> 00:45:45,419
Some people read palms, tea leaves.

509
00:45:45,609 --> 00:45:46,815
I read feet.

510
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:50,282
Look! Look what it says.

511
00:45:51,381 --> 00:45:52,621
It says "rejoice."

512
00:45:52,816 --> 00:45:53,988
It does?

513
00:45:55,219 --> 00:45:57,165
It says "Keds."

514
00:46:00,491 --> 00:46:03,438
No, it says "Rejoice.
Be exceedingly glad.

515
00:46:03,627 --> 00:46:06,506
For great is your reward
in the kingdom of Heaven."

516
00:46:06,697 --> 00:46:07,698
Come on!

517
00:46:10,868 --> 00:46:11,869
<i>When...</i>

518
00:46:12,069 --> 00:46:13,173
<i>...you...</i>

519
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:14,280
<i>...feel...</i>

520
00:46:14,471 --> 00:46:15,575
<i>...sad</i>

521
00:46:17,174 --> 00:46:19,176
<i>Or under a curse</i>

522
00:46:21,145 --> 00:46:23,284
<i>Your life is bad</i>

523
00:46:25,182 --> 00:46:27,321
<i>Your prospects are worse</i>

524
00:46:29,153 --> 00:46:32,464
<i>Your wife is sighing</i>

525
00:46:32,656 --> 00:46:34,101
<i>Crying</i>

526
00:46:34,858 --> 00:46:38,567
<i>And your olive tree is dying</i>

527
00:46:38,762 --> 00:46:40,742
<i>Temples are graying
Teeth are decaying</i>

528
00:46:40,931 --> 00:46:43,241
<i>And creditors weighing your purse</i>

529
00:46:46,036 --> 00:46:47,538
<i>Your mood</i>

530
00:46:48,005 --> 00:46:50,815
<i>And your robe</i>

531
00:46:52,676 --> 00:46:54,713
<i>Are both a deep blue</i>

532
00:46:56,446 --> 00:46:58,483
<i>You'd bet that Job</i>

533
00:47:00,384 --> 00:47:02,295
<i>Had nothing on you</i>

534
00:47:03,954 --> 00:47:05,695
<i>Don't forget that</i>

535
00:47:05,889 --> 00:47:08,495
<i>When you get</i>

536
00:47:08,692 --> 00:47:12,834
<i>Into Heaven you'll be blessed</i>

537
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:18,112
<i>Yes, it's all for the best</i>

538
00:47:21,305 --> 00:47:23,683
<i>Some men live at ease
Doing what they please</i>

539
00:47:23,874 --> 00:47:26,252
<i>Richer than the bees are in honey</i>

540
00:47:26,443 --> 00:47:28,150
<i>Never growing old
Never feeling cold</i>

541
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:30,256
<i>Pulling pots of gold from thin air</i>

542
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,687
<i>The best in every town
Best at shaking down</i>

543
00:47:32,883 --> 00:47:34,954
<i>Best at making mountains of money</i>

544
00:47:35,152 --> 00:47:37,154
<i>They can't take it with them</i>

545
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:38,594
<i>But what do they care?</i>

546
00:47:38,789 --> 00:47:41,235
<i>They get the center of the meat
Cushions on their seat</i>

547
00:47:41,425 --> 00:47:43,996
<i>Houses on the street
Where it's sunny</i>

548
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:45,605
<i>Summers at the sea
Winters warm and free</i>

549
00:47:45,796 --> 00:47:47,776
<i>All of this
And we get the rest</i>

550
00:47:48,131 --> 00:47:52,273
<i>But who is the land for?
The sun and the sand for?</i>

551
00:47:52,469 --> 00:47:56,417
<i>You guessed
it's all for the best</i>

552
00:48:05,315 --> 00:48:06,225
Thanks.

553
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:17,736
<i>When you feel sad</i>

554
00:48:18,462 --> 00:48:20,169
<i>Or under a curse</i>

555
00:48:20,497 --> 00:48:22,170
<i>Your life is bad</i>

556
00:48:22,599 --> 00:48:24,476
<i>Your prospects are worse</i>

557
00:48:24,701 --> 00:48:27,341
<i>Your wife is sighing, crying</i>

558
00:48:27,537 --> 00:48:29,141
<i>And your olive tree is dying</i>

559
00:48:29,339 --> 00:48:31,546
<i>Temples are graying
Teeth are decaying</i>

560
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:33,221
<i>Creditors weighing your purse</i>

561
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:34,889
<i>Your mood and your robe</i>

562
00:48:35,245 --> 00:48:37,418
<i>Are both a deep blue
Yes, sir</i>

563
00:48:37,614 --> 00:48:38,888
<i>You'd bet that Job</i>

564
00:48:39,683 --> 00:48:41,060
<i>Had nothing on you</i>

565
00:48:41,551 --> 00:48:42,495
<i>Don't forget</i>

566
00:48:42,686 --> 00:48:46,429
<i>That when you get to Heaven
You'll be blessed</i>

567
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:49,830
<i>Yes, it's all for the best</i>

568
00:48:54,831 --> 00:48:58,608
How can you take the speck of sawdust
out of your brother's eye...

569
00:48:58,802 --> 00:49:02,215
...when all the time there's
this great plank in your own?

570
00:49:02,572 --> 00:49:06,110
I don't know. How can you take
it out of your brother's eye...

571
00:49:06,310 --> 00:49:08,756
...when there's this
great plank in your own?

572
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:10,516
You hypocrite!

573
00:49:10,914 --> 00:49:12,791
First you take the plank
out of your eye...

574
00:49:12,983 --> 00:49:17,125
...so you can see clearly to take
the speck out of your brother's.

575
00:49:17,387 --> 00:49:20,698
Wait a minute!
That's no answer to the question.

576
00:49:20,891 --> 00:49:23,303
Did I promise you
an answer to the question?

577
00:50:21,451 --> 00:50:23,328
<i>You guessed
it's all for the--</i>

578
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,500
All your wrongs will be redressed.

579
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:27,168
<i>Yes, it's all for the--</i>

580
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:28,734
You must never be distressed.

581
00:50:29,393 --> 00:50:30,997
<i>Yes, it's all for the--</i>

582
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:32,639
Someone's got to be oppressed.

583
00:50:33,296 --> 00:50:36,743
<i>Yes, it's all for the best</i>

584
00:51:56,313 --> 00:51:57,451
Hello.

585
00:51:59,249 --> 00:52:01,456
Love your enemies.

586
00:52:01,651 --> 00:52:04,530
- And pray for your persecutors.
- You don't mean...

587
00:52:04,721 --> 00:52:06,758
-I do.
- You do?

588
00:52:09,826 --> 00:52:11,305
I love you.

589
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:30,124
Come on!

590
00:52:48,298 --> 00:52:49,470
Right here.

591
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:52,040
A sower went to sow some seed.

592
00:52:52,235 --> 00:52:54,738
As he sowed, some seed
fell on the footpath...

593
00:52:56,940 --> 00:53:00,012
...where it was trampled on,
and the birds ate it up.

594
00:53:02,779 --> 00:53:05,123
Some seed fell on rock.

595
00:53:05,749 --> 00:53:07,387
And after coming up--

596
00:53:07,651 --> 00:53:10,825
Grow, grow, grow,
grow, grow, grow.

597
00:53:14,791 --> 00:53:18,000
--Withered for lack of moisture.

598
00:53:28,772 --> 00:53:31,616
And some seed fell
in among the weeds.

599
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:35,750
And the weeds grew up with it...

600
00:53:35,946 --> 00:53:37,220
...and choked it.

601
00:53:41,351 --> 00:53:44,355
And some seed fell into good soil.

602
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:48,769
Good soil!

603
00:53:48,959 --> 00:53:49,835
Come on!

604
00:53:50,026 --> 00:53:53,098
It grew and it yielded
a hundredfold.

605
00:53:56,499 --> 00:53:58,035
Do you know what the seed is?

606
00:53:58,235 --> 00:54:00,579
- A baby.
- Wrong!

607
00:54:00,837 --> 00:54:02,407
The seed is the word of God.

608
00:54:02,672 --> 00:54:05,278
And that seed which fell
along the footpath...

609
00:54:05,475 --> 00:54:07,580
...represents those
who hear the word...

610
00:54:07,777 --> 00:54:10,087
...but then the devil comes
and carries them off...

611
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:13,090
...for fear they should believe
and be saved.

612
00:54:16,419 --> 00:54:18,421
And that which fell upon rock...

613
00:54:18,822 --> 00:54:20,824
...they receive the word with joy.

614
00:54:21,024 --> 00:54:24,198
But they have no root.
So in time of testing, they desert.

615
00:54:25,895 --> 00:54:27,636
- Bye.
- See you.

616
00:54:31,635 --> 00:54:33,444
And that which fell among weeds...

617
00:54:33,637 --> 00:54:36,379
...hear the word, but their
growth is impaired by wealth...

618
00:54:36,973 --> 00:54:39,977
...and cares and the pleasures
of the world.

619
00:54:40,176 --> 00:54:42,247
They bring nothing to fruit.

620
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:45,422
No fruit, Robin.

621
00:54:46,683 --> 00:54:50,062
But that which fell
among good soil...

622
00:54:50,253 --> 00:54:51,823
Hey, good soil!

623
00:54:54,257 --> 00:54:56,794
They hear the word with
a good and honest heart...

624
00:54:56,993 --> 00:54:58,802
...and through their perseverance...

625
00:54:58,995 --> 00:55:00,872
...yield a harvest.

626
00:55:19,716 --> 00:55:23,163
<i>We plow the fields and scatter</i>

627
00:55:23,353 --> 00:55:26,197
<i>The good seed on the land</i>

628
00:55:27,123 --> 00:55:30,161
<i>But it is fed and watered</i>

629
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:33,739
<i>By God's almighty hand</i>

630
00:55:34,297 --> 00:55:37,506
<i>He sends the snow in winter</i>

631
00:55:37,701 --> 00:55:41,148
<i>The warmth to swell the grain</i>

632
00:55:41,538 --> 00:55:44,849
<i>The breezes and the sunshine</i>

633
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:49,316
<i>And soft refreshing rain</i>

634
00:55:50,847 --> 00:55:55,626
<i>All good gifts around us</i>

635
00:55:58,421 --> 00:56:02,233
<i>Are sent from Heaven above</i>

636
00:56:05,395 --> 00:56:07,739
<i>So thank the Lord</i>

637
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:10,602
<i>Oh, thank the Lord</i>

638
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:13,212
<i>For all His love</i>

639
00:56:27,417 --> 00:56:29,590
Consider the lilies of the field.

640
00:56:29,786 --> 00:56:32,323
They don't work.
They don't spin.

641
00:56:32,522 --> 00:56:35,401
And yet, I tell you,
Solomon in all his splendor...

642
00:56:35,592 --> 00:56:37,572
...was not attired
like one of these.

643
00:56:38,094 --> 00:56:41,405
Now, if that's how God clothes
the grass which is here today...

644
00:56:41,598 --> 00:56:44,579
...and tomorrow is thrown
unto the fire...

645
00:56:44,968 --> 00:56:48,074
...will He not all the more
clothe you?

646
00:56:50,039 --> 00:56:53,418
<i>We thank Thee then, O Father</i>

647
00:56:53,610 --> 00:56:56,819
<i>For all things bright and good</i>

648
00:56:57,414 --> 00:57:00,486
<i>The seed time and the harvest</i>

649
00:57:00,683 --> 00:57:04,392
<i>Our life, our health, our food</i>

650
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:07,727
<i>No gifts have we to offer</i>

651
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:11,337
<i>For all Thy love imparts</i>

652
00:57:12,162 --> 00:57:14,870
<i>But that which Thou desirest</i>

653
00:57:15,064 --> 00:57:19,240
<i>Our humble thankful hearts</i>

654
00:57:21,004 --> 00:57:25,453
<i>All good gifts around us</i>

655
00:57:28,678 --> 00:57:32,922
<i>Are sent from Heaven above</i>

656
00:57:35,485 --> 00:57:37,658
<i>So thank the Lord</i>

657
00:57:38,254 --> 00:57:40,700
<i>Oh, thank the Lord</i>

658
00:57:40,890 --> 00:57:44,303
<i>For all His love</i>

659
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:50,077
<i>I really want to thank you, Lord</i>

660
00:57:50,266 --> 00:57:54,806
<i>All good gifts around us</i>

661
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:01,946
<i>Are sent from Heaven above</i>

662
00:58:04,547 --> 00:58:08,222
<i>All good gifts around us</i>

663
00:58:11,287 --> 00:58:13,858
<i>Just thank you, Lord</i>

664
00:59:00,570 --> 00:59:04,382
Once upon a time, there was a man
who had two sons.

665
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:09,046
And the younger son
said to his father:

666
00:59:09,245 --> 00:59:11,316
Father, give me
my share of the property!

667
00:59:11,614 --> 00:59:14,891
So he divided his estate
between them.

668
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:23,496
A few days later, the younger son...

669
00:59:23,693 --> 00:59:26,230
...turned the whole of his share
into cash.

670
00:59:26,429 --> 00:59:28,136
And left home
for a distant country.

671
00:59:49,686 --> 00:59:52,929
Where I squandered the money
on reckless living.

672
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:11,843
He'd spent it all when
a famine fell upon the country...

673
01:00:12,041 --> 01:00:13,543
...and he began to feel the pinch.

674
01:00:16,045 --> 01:00:20,255
So he decided to attach himself
to one of the local landowners...

675
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:23,454
...who sent him on the farm
to mind the pigs.

676
01:00:23,953 --> 01:00:26,433
He would've been glad
to have filled his belly...

677
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:28,569
...with the pods
the pigs were eating...

678
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:33,504
...but no one gave him anything.

679
01:00:33,997 --> 01:00:36,671
And then he came to his senses.

680
01:00:39,135 --> 01:00:39,875
He said :

681
01:00:40,370 --> 01:00:44,318
How many of my father's servants
have more food than they can eat...

682
01:00:44,507 --> 01:00:46,885
...and here I am starving to death?

683
01:00:47,076 --> 01:00:51,024
I will set off and I will go to
my father's house and say to him :

684
01:00:51,214 --> 01:00:54,423
"Father, I have sinned against God
and against you.

685
01:00:54,751 --> 01:00:57,095
I am no longer fit
to be called your son.

686
01:00:57,286 --> 01:00:59,630
Treat me as one of
your paid servants."

687
01:01:04,927 --> 01:01:07,737
So he set out for
his father's house.

688
01:01:08,731 --> 01:01:10,677
Yes, and there he goes.

689
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:15,077
While he was still a long way off...

690
01:01:15,271 --> 01:01:17,182
...his father saw him.

691
01:01:19,108 --> 01:01:20,849
And his heart went out to him.

692
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:25,985
The son ran to meet his father...

693
01:01:26,182 --> 01:01:28,526
...and like the spunky kid he is...

694
01:01:28,718 --> 01:01:31,426
...threw his arms around him,
kissed him and said:

695
01:01:31,888 --> 01:01:35,062
Father, I have sinned against God
and against you.

696
01:01:35,258 --> 01:01:37,636
I am no longer fit
to be called your son.

697
01:01:37,827 --> 01:01:40,364
Treat me as one of
your paid servants.

698
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:43,901
But the father called
to one of his servants :

699
01:01:44,534 --> 01:01:45,808
Servant!

700
01:01:46,869 --> 01:01:49,873
Quick, fetch me my robe,
my best one.

701
01:01:50,273 --> 01:01:52,776
Put rings on his fingers
and bells on his toes...

702
01:01:52,975 --> 01:01:55,285
...so he shall have music
wherever he goes.

703
01:01:56,479 --> 01:01:57,753
Wrong story.

704
01:01:57,980 --> 01:02:01,587
Put rings on his fingers
and shoes on his feet...

705
01:02:01,784 --> 01:02:04,287
...and bring the fatted calf
and kill it.

706
01:02:09,258 --> 01:02:10,293
I said kill it.

707
01:02:12,795 --> 01:02:14,331
I said kill it!

708
01:02:16,365 --> 01:02:19,369
And let us have a feast
to celebrate this here day...

709
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:22,106
...for this son of mine was lost...

710
01:02:23,906 --> 01:02:25,408
...and is found...

711
01:02:25,608 --> 01:02:28,487
...was dead and has come back to life.

712
01:02:41,290 --> 01:02:44,635
Now, the oldest kid was
out on the farm working.

713
01:02:47,296 --> 01:02:50,004
And on his way back,
as he approached the house...

714
01:02:50,199 --> 01:02:53,180
...he heard music and dancing.

715
01:02:56,139 --> 01:02:59,313
He called one of his servants
and asked him what it meant.

716
01:02:59,509 --> 01:03:00,852
The servant said :

717
01:03:01,043 --> 01:03:03,489
Your brother's come back home again.

718
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:05,955
Your father's killed
the fatted calf...

719
01:03:06,149 --> 01:03:08,493
...because he got him back
safe and sound.

720
01:03:09,719 --> 01:03:12,825
Well, the brother was
rather irritated by this.

721
01:03:17,527 --> 01:03:19,632
He refused to go into the house.

722
01:03:23,566 --> 01:03:25,842
The father came out
and pleaded with him.

723
01:03:26,235 --> 01:03:27,873
But he retorted, saying :

724
01:03:28,171 --> 01:03:31,675
You know how I've worked
for you all these years...

725
01:03:32,508 --> 01:03:35,284
...and you never gave me
so much as a kid...

726
01:03:35,478 --> 01:03:37,458
...for a feast with my friends.

727
01:03:37,747 --> 01:03:41,251
But once this
son of yours turns up...

728
01:03:42,451 --> 01:03:46,160
...after running through
your money with his women...

729
01:03:48,391 --> 01:03:52,669
...you killed
the fatted calf for him.

730
01:03:55,498 --> 01:03:56,841
I said kill it.

731
01:04:05,374 --> 01:04:07,877
I said kill it!

732
01:04:16,452 --> 01:04:18,955
"My boy," said the father.

733
01:04:19,155 --> 01:04:22,659
"You've always been with me
and everything I have is yours.

734
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:26,773
Now, how could we help
but celebrate on this happy day...

735
01:04:28,097 --> 01:04:31,306
...for your brother here was dead
and he's come back to life...

736
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:33,605
...metaphorically speaking.

737
01:04:34,270 --> 01:04:36,750
Was lost and is found."

738
01:04:43,145 --> 01:04:44,624
Them's my boys.

739
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:05,607
Is there a man among you
who'd offer his son a stone...

740
01:05:05,801 --> 01:05:07,405
...when he asks for bread?

741
01:05:12,208 --> 01:05:14,210
A snake, if he asks for fish?

742
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:16,014
If you, then, mad as you are...

743
01:05:16,212 --> 01:05:20,024
...now know how to give your children
what is good for them...

744
01:05:20,216 --> 01:05:22,389
...how much more will
your Heavenly Father...

745
01:05:22,585 --> 01:05:24,292
...give good things...

746
01:05:26,322 --> 01:05:28,165
...to those who ask for them?

747
01:05:28,357 --> 01:05:31,133
Treat others as you would have
them treat you.

748
01:05:32,328 --> 01:05:34,308
Well, that is the Law
and the prophets.

749
01:05:34,497 --> 01:05:37,501
The Law and the prophets,
the Law and the prophets.

750
01:05:43,105 --> 01:05:45,415
You are the light of the world.

751
01:05:47,476 --> 01:05:50,355
<i>You are the light of the world</i>

752
01:05:51,914 --> 01:05:54,451
<i>But if that light is under a bushel</i>

753
01:05:54,650 --> 01:05:57,358
<i>it's lost something kind of crucial</i>

754
01:05:57,787 --> 01:05:59,596
<i>You've got to stay bright</i>

755
01:05:59,789 --> 01:06:02,235
<i>To be the light of the world</i>

756
01:06:02,892 --> 01:06:05,600
<i>You are the salt of the earth</i>

757
01:06:07,863 --> 01:06:11,072
<i>You are the salt of the earth</i>

758
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:14,142
<i>But if that salt has lost its flavor</i>

759
01:06:14,337 --> 01:06:16,977
<i>it ain't got much in its favor</i>

760
01:06:17,173 --> 01:06:21,553
<i>You can't have that fault
And be the salt of the earth</i>

761
01:06:21,744 --> 01:06:26,318
<i>So let your light soul shine
before men</i>

762
01:06:26,515 --> 01:06:30,258
<i>Let your light soul shine</i>

763
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:33,763
<i>So that they might know</i>

764
01:06:33,956 --> 01:06:36,732
<i>Some kindness again</i>

765
01:06:36,926 --> 01:06:38,872
<i>We all need help to feel fine</i>

766
01:06:39,462 --> 01:06:41,738
Let's have some wine!

767
01:06:41,931 --> 01:06:44,673
<i>You are the city of God</i>

768
01:06:46,836 --> 01:06:50,409
<i>You are the city of God</i>

769
01:06:50,606 --> 01:06:52,916
<i>But if that city's on a hill</i>

770
01:06:53,109 --> 01:06:55,385
<i>it's kind of hard to hide it well</i>

771
01:06:56,412 --> 01:06:58,517
<i>You've got to stay pretty</i>

772
01:06:58,714 --> 01:07:00,216
<i>In the city of God</i>

773
01:07:00,416 --> 01:07:05,195
<i>So let your light soul shine
before men</i>

774
01:07:05,388 --> 01:07:07,994
<i>Let your light soul shine</i>

775
01:07:09,892 --> 01:07:12,566
<i>So that they might know</i>

776
01:07:12,762 --> 01:07:14,708
<i>Some kindness again</i>

777
01:07:15,831 --> 01:07:17,902
<i>We all need help to feel fine</i>

778
01:07:18,334 --> 01:07:20,371
Let's have some wine!

779
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:23,616
<i>You are the light of the world</i>

780
01:07:25,474 --> 01:07:28,478
<i>You are the light of the world</i>

781
01:07:29,278 --> 01:07:31,554
<i>But the tallest candlestick</i>

782
01:07:31,747 --> 01:07:34,626
<i>Ain't much good without a wick</i>

783
01:07:34,817 --> 01:07:36,421
<i>You've got to live right</i>

784
01:07:36,619 --> 01:07:39,259
<i>To be the light of the world</i>

785
01:07:40,256 --> 01:07:41,735
Stroke!

786
01:07:42,491 --> 01:07:43,799
Stroke!

787
01:08:02,378 --> 01:08:03,482
Stop!

788
01:08:07,917 --> 01:08:09,328
This is the beginning.

789
01:08:09,518 --> 01:08:11,759
By whose authority...

790
01:08:12,588 --> 01:08:14,568
...are you acting like this?

791
01:08:16,826 --> 01:08:21,036
Who gave you this authority?

792
01:08:21,897 --> 01:08:23,433
I have a question to ask you.

793
01:08:27,169 --> 01:08:30,048
The baptism of John,
was it from God or from man?

794
01:08:30,573 --> 01:08:34,385
If we say from God, he will say,
"Then why did you not believe?"

795
01:08:34,810 --> 01:08:37,757
But if we say from men,
the people will be angry...

796
01:08:37,947 --> 01:08:39,756
...for they took John as a prophet.

797
01:08:40,516 --> 01:08:45,465
We do not know.

798
01:08:46,055 --> 01:08:49,298
Then neither will I tell you
by whose authority I act.

799
01:08:49,492 --> 01:08:50,334
Stop!

800
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:58,977
Now, we know you are an honest man.

801
01:08:59,902 --> 01:09:03,213
Give us your ruling on this :

802
01:09:03,739 --> 01:09:06,948
Are we or are we not permitted...

803
01:09:07,610 --> 01:09:11,456
...to pay taxes to the Roman emperor?

804
01:09:14,049 --> 01:09:15,892
Why, you hypocrites!

805
01:09:17,987 --> 01:09:20,968
Show me the money
in which the tax is paid.

806
01:09:25,494 --> 01:09:27,496
Whose head is on here,
whose inscription?

807
01:09:27,696 --> 01:09:30,233
Caesar's.

808
01:09:30,666 --> 01:09:33,510
Well then, pay Caesar
what is due Caesar...

809
01:09:34,003 --> 01:09:36,244
...but pay God what is due God.

810
01:09:37,006 --> 01:09:40,647
What is the greatest commandment...

811
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:43,183
...of them all?

812
01:09:43,946 --> 01:09:48,122
"Thou shalt love the Lord your God
with all your heart and all your soul."

813
01:09:48,484 --> 01:09:51,328
This is the greatest commandment
of them all.

814
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:53,295
And the second is like it:

815
01:09:53,689 --> 01:09:56,932
"Thou shalt love thy neighbor
as thyself."

816
01:09:57,126 --> 01:10:00,437
All the rest of the Law and
what the prophets have written...

817
01:10:00,629 --> 01:10:02,404
...is based on these first two.

818
01:10:05,901 --> 01:10:08,745
You doctors of the Law
and you Pharisees...

819
01:10:08,938 --> 01:10:11,111
...sit in the chair of Moses.

820
01:10:11,307 --> 01:10:13,446
But you say one thing
and you do another.

821
01:10:13,642 --> 01:10:16,316
Everything you do is done for show.

822
01:10:16,512 --> 01:10:20,927
You like to have your places of honor
at feasts and in the synagogues...

823
01:10:21,116 --> 01:10:24,654
...and to be greeted respectfully
and to be called "teacher."

824
01:10:27,690 --> 01:10:30,967
But you must not
be called "teacher."

825
01:10:31,227 --> 01:10:34,731
For you have one teacher:
the Messiah.

826
01:10:35,097 --> 01:10:38,306
And you must not call
any man on earth "Father."

827
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:42,073
For you have one Father,
and you are all brothers.

828
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:47,286
<i>Alas, for you lawyers and Pharisees</i>

829
01:10:47,476 --> 01:10:49,456
<i>Hypocrites that you be</i>

830
01:10:50,746 --> 01:10:52,953
<i>Searching for souls
And fools to forsake them</i>

831
01:10:53,148 --> 01:10:55,253
<i>You travel the land
You scour the sea</i>

832
01:10:55,451 --> 01:10:57,124
<i>Then when you've got your converts</i>

833
01:10:57,319 --> 01:10:59,697
<i>You make them twice as fit for Hell</i>

834
01:10:59,888 --> 01:11:02,027
<i>As you are yourselves</i>

835
01:11:02,224 --> 01:11:04,670
<i>Alas! For you lawyers and Pharisees</i>

836
01:11:04,860 --> 01:11:06,271
<i>Hypocrites that you are</i>

837
01:11:07,997 --> 01:11:10,204
<i>Sure that the kingdom of Heaven
Awaits you</i>

838
01:11:10,399 --> 01:11:12,811
<i>You will not venture half so far</i>

839
01:11:13,002 --> 01:11:15,039
<i>Other men who might enter the gates</i>

840
01:11:15,437 --> 01:11:17,110
<i>You keep from passing through</i>

841
01:11:17,306 --> 01:11:19,650
<i>Drag them down with you</i>

842
01:11:19,842 --> 01:11:21,515
<i>You snakes, you viper's brew</i>

843
01:11:21,710 --> 01:11:24,054
<i>You cannot escape being devil's food</i>

844
01:11:24,246 --> 01:11:26,783
<i>I send you prophets
And I send you preachers</i>

845
01:11:26,982 --> 01:11:29,155
<i>Sages in rages and ages of teachers</i>

846
01:11:29,351 --> 01:11:31,627
<i>Nothing can mar your mood</i>

847
01:11:33,789 --> 01:11:35,166
<i>Blind guide</i>

848
01:11:36,358 --> 01:11:37,530
<i>Blind fools</i>

849
01:11:39,028 --> 01:11:40,405
<i>The blood you've spilt</i>

850
01:11:40,596 --> 01:11:43,133
<i>On you will fall</i>

851
01:11:43,666 --> 01:11:45,577
<i>This nation</i>

852
01:11:45,768 --> 01:11:48,146
<i>This generation</i>

853
01:11:48,904 --> 01:11:52,442
<i>Will bear the guilt of it all</i>

854
01:11:56,178 --> 01:11:58,658
<i>Alas, alas, alas! For you</i>

855
01:12:00,816 --> 01:12:02,295
<i>Blind fools!</i>

856
01:12:21,136 --> 01:12:22,979
Oh, Jerusalem!

857
01:12:23,172 --> 01:12:24,378
Jerusalem...

858
01:12:25,007 --> 01:12:29,513
City that stones the prophets and
murders the messengers sent to her.

859
01:12:30,012 --> 01:12:32,925
How often have I longed
to gather your children...

860
01:12:33,115 --> 01:12:36,255
...as a hen gathers her brood
under her wings?

861
01:12:36,618 --> 01:12:38,996
But you would not let me.

862
01:12:39,288 --> 01:12:40,631
And so I tell you...

863
01:12:40,823 --> 01:12:44,202
...you shall never see me
until the time when you say:

864
01:12:44,393 --> 01:12:48,432
"Blessing on Him who comes
in the name of the Lord."

865
01:14:18,954 --> 01:14:21,560
<i>Where are you going?</i>

866
01:14:22,624 --> 01:14:25,400
<i>Where are you going?</i>

867
01:14:26,228 --> 01:14:30,540
<i>Can you take me with you?</i>

868
01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:34,544
<i>For my hand is cold</i>

869
01:14:35,204 --> 01:14:37,650
<i>And needs warmth</i>

870
01:14:38,807 --> 01:14:41,788
<i>Where are you going?</i>

871
01:14:48,450 --> 01:14:53,229
<i>Far beyond where the horizon lies</i>

872
01:14:53,589 --> 01:14:57,264
<i>Where the horizon lies</i>

873
01:14:57,459 --> 01:15:01,737
<i>And the land sinks into</i>

874
01:15:02,264 --> 01:15:04,608
<i>Mellow blueness</i>

875
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:06,939
<i>Oh please</i>

876
01:15:07,870 --> 01:15:10,441
<i>Take me with you</i>

877
01:15:13,675 --> 01:15:18,420
<i>Let me skip the road with you</i>

878
01:15:18,847 --> 01:15:22,260
<i>I can dare myself</i>

879
01:15:23,051 --> 01:15:25,429
<i>I can dare myself</i>

880
01:15:28,423 --> 01:15:30,425
<i>I'll put a pebble</i>

881
01:15:30,626 --> 01:15:33,698
<i>In my shoe</i>

882
01:15:33,896 --> 01:15:35,569
<i>And watch me walk</i>

883
01:15:37,633 --> 01:15:42,082
<i>I can walk and walk</i>

884
01:15:46,275 --> 01:15:50,189
<i>I shall call the pebble Dare</i>

885
01:15:53,048 --> 01:15:55,324
<i>We will talk together</i>

886
01:15:55,651 --> 01:15:58,325
<i>About walking</i>

887
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:01,000
<i>Dare shall be carried</i>

888
01:16:01,223 --> 01:16:05,638
<i>And when we both have had enough</i>

889
01:16:06,194 --> 01:16:11,007
<i>I will take him from my shoe singing</i>

890
01:16:11,266 --> 01:16:15,009
<i>Meet your new road</i>

891
01:16:17,172 --> 01:16:20,153
<i>Then I'll take...</i>

892
01:16:20,709 --> 01:16:22,711
<i>...your hand</i>

893
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:26,353
<i>Finally glad</i>

894
01:16:28,083 --> 01:16:30,256
<i>That you are here</i>

895
01:16:31,853 --> 01:16:34,857
<i>By my side</i>

896
01:17:02,618 --> 01:17:05,030
Then the man they called
Judas Iscariot...

897
01:17:05,220 --> 01:17:08,064
...went to the chief priests
and said:

898
01:17:08,590 --> 01:17:11,036
What will you give me
to betray him to you?

899
01:17:12,661 --> 01:17:15,005
They paid him 30 pieces of silver.

900
01:17:17,032 --> 01:17:21,003
And from that moment, he began
to look out for an opportunity...

901
01:17:21,570 --> 01:17:23,049
...to betray him.

902
01:17:23,238 --> 01:17:25,684
<i>By my side</i>

903
01:17:37,452 --> 01:17:39,227
<i>By my side</i>

904
01:17:39,421 --> 01:17:42,265
<i>That you are here</i>

905
01:17:43,025 --> 01:17:45,869
<i>By my side</i>

906
01:18:05,147 --> 01:18:08,390
<i>Come sing me sweet rejoicing</i>

907
01:18:09,351 --> 01:18:12,093
<i>Come sing me love</i>

908
01:18:13,588 --> 01:18:17,001
<i>We're not afraid of voicing</i>

909
01:18:17,459 --> 01:18:19,132
<i>All the things</i>

910
01:18:19,327 --> 01:18:22,365
<i>We're dreaming of</i>

911
01:18:22,564 --> 01:18:24,908
<i>Oh, high and low</i>

912
01:18:25,667 --> 01:18:29,581
<i>And everywhere we go</i>

913
01:18:30,038 --> 01:18:31,176
<i>We can build</i>

914
01:18:32,074 --> 01:18:33,747
<i>A beautiful city</i>

915
01:18:34,076 --> 01:18:35,555
<i>Yes we can</i>

916
01:18:36,211 --> 01:18:38,213
<i>Yes we can</i>

917
01:18:38,413 --> 01:18:39,721
<i>We can build</i>

918
01:18:40,515 --> 01:18:42,324
<i>A beautiful city</i>

919
01:18:42,551 --> 01:18:43,791
<i>Call it out</i>

920
01:18:44,753 --> 01:18:49,133
<i>And call it the City of Man</i>

921
01:18:52,127 --> 01:18:55,904
<i>We don't need alabaster</i>

922
01:18:56,098 --> 01:18:59,102
<i>We don't need chrome</i>

923
01:19:00,435 --> 01:19:04,144
<i>We've got our special plaster</i>

924
01:19:04,372 --> 01:19:05,544
<i>Take my hand</i>

925
01:19:06,374 --> 01:19:08,615
<i>I'll take you home</i>

926
01:19:09,811 --> 01:19:12,485
<i>We see nations rise</i>

927
01:19:13,014 --> 01:19:16,484
<i>In each other's eyes</i>

928
01:19:17,452 --> 01:19:18,954
<i>We can build</i>

929
01:19:19,287 --> 01:19:21,062
<i>A beautiful city</i>

930
01:19:21,356 --> 01:19:22,391
<i>Yes we can</i>

931
01:19:23,725 --> 01:19:25,534
<i>Yes we can</i>

932
01:19:25,727 --> 01:19:26,865
<i>We can build</i>

933
01:19:27,829 --> 01:19:29,399
<i>A beautiful city</i>

934
01:19:30,198 --> 01:19:31,643
<i>Call it out</i>

935
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:36,981
<i>And call it the City of Man</i>

936
01:19:43,645 --> 01:19:47,149
<i>Come sing me sweet rejoicing</i>

937
01:19:47,849 --> 01:19:50,989
<i>Come sing me love</i>

938
01:19:51,987 --> 01:19:55,457
<i>We're not afraid of voicing</i>

939
01:19:55,757 --> 01:19:57,464
<i>All the things</i>

<i>We're dreaming of</i>

01:20:00,862 --> 01:20:03,775
<i>Oh, high and low</i>

942
01:20:04,032 --> 01:20:07,707
<i>And everywhere we go</i>

943
01:20:10,438 --> 01:20:11,917
<i>We can build</i>

944
01:20:12,541 --> 01:20:14,214
<i>A beautiful city</i>

945
01:20:14,576 --> 01:20:15,884
<i>Yes we can</i>

01:20:19,114 --> 01:20:20,616

<i>A beautiful city</i>

949
01:20:23,151 --> 01:20:24,755
<i>Call it out</i>

950
01:20:25,187 --> 01:20:26,564
<i>And call it</i>

951
01:20:26,888 --> 01:20:31,837
<i>The City of Man</i>

952
01:20:56,518 --> 01:20:57,394
Come on!

953
01:20:57,586 --> 01:20:58,621
Where?

954
01:21:16,771 --> 01:21:18,808
- Okay, come on.
- Come here.

955
01:21:19,207 --> 01:21:21,278
Sit next to me, okay?

956
01:22:07,589 --> 01:22:08,624
Hey, that's you!

957
01:23:13,355 --> 01:23:14,857
I tell you this :

958
01:23:15,657 --> 01:23:18,035
One of you among us will betray me.

959
01:23:18,226 --> 01:23:19,705
Could it be me, Lord?

960
01:23:19,894 --> 01:23:20,964
How about me?

961
01:23:21,162 --> 01:23:22,163
How about me?

962
01:23:22,397 --> 01:23:23,398
Could it be me?

963
01:23:23,598 --> 01:23:24,542
Could it be me?

964
01:23:24,733 --> 01:23:25,837
Rabbi...

965
01:23:26,501 --> 01:23:28,037
...can you mean me?

966
01:23:30,939 --> 01:23:32,782
The words are yours.

967
01:23:34,442 --> 01:23:36,444
Do quickly what you have to do.

968
01:24:14,249 --> 01:24:15,956
Take this and eat.

969
01:24:16,651 --> 01:24:19,598
Eat, for this is my body.

970
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:40,678
Take this and drink...

971
01:24:41,843 --> 01:24:43,754
...for this is my blood.

972
01:24:45,647 --> 01:24:49,925
The blood of the covenant,
shed for the forgiveness of sins.

973
01:24:53,655 --> 01:24:55,032
And I tell you...

974
01:24:55,490 --> 01:24:58,903
...I shall never again drink
from the fruit of the vine...

975
01:24:59,327 --> 01:25:03,707
...until I drink it again with you
in the kingdom of my Father.

976
01:25:16,077 --> 01:25:19,615
<i>On the willows there</i>

977
01:25:20,548 --> 01:25:24,155
<i>We hung up our lives</i>

978
01:25:24,886 --> 01:25:28,265
<i>For our captors there...</i>

979
01:25:28,957 --> 01:25:31,801
<i>...required</i>

980
01:25:33,261 --> 01:25:35,104
<i>Of our songs</i>

981
01:25:37,632 --> 01:25:41,671
<i>And our tormentors' mirth</i>

982
01:25:50,912 --> 01:25:54,416
<i>On the willows there</i>

983
01:25:55,350 --> 01:25:58,797
<i>We hung up our lives</i>

984
01:25:59,554 --> 01:26:03,195
<i>For our captors there...</i>

985
01:26:03,992 --> 01:26:05,767
<i>...required</i>

986
01:26:08,363 --> 01:26:09,933
<i>Of our songs</i>

987
01:26:12,700 --> 01:26:16,546
<i>And our tormentors' mirth</i>

988
01:26:23,511 --> 01:26:25,752
<i>Saying...</i>

989
01:26:25,947 --> 01:26:28,393
<i>...sing us one</i>

990
01:26:29,350 --> 01:26:32,888
<i>Of the songs of Zion</i>

991
01:26:34,956 --> 01:26:37,527
<i>Sing us one</i>

992
01:26:38,526 --> 01:26:42,099
<i>Of the songs of Zion</i>

993
01:26:43,998 --> 01:26:46,239
<i>Sing us one</i>

994
01:26:47,402 --> 01:26:50,975
<i>Of the songs of Zion</i>

995
01:26:53,908 --> 01:26:57,446
<i>But how can we sing</i>

996
01:26:59,681 --> 01:27:02,025
<i>Sing the Lord's song</i>

997
01:27:04,485 --> 01:27:09,366
<i>In a foreign land?</i>

998
01:27:18,866 --> 01:27:21,938
Stay here while
I go over there to pray.

999
01:27:24,272 --> 01:27:27,412
My heart is ready
to break with grief.

1000
01:27:35,583 --> 01:27:37,153
Stop here...

1001
01:27:38,620 --> 01:27:40,497
...and stay awake with me.

1002
01:27:50,298 --> 01:27:53,677
<i>On the willows there</i>

1003
01:27:54,802 --> 01:27:58,306
<i>We hung up our lives</i>

1004
01:28:10,385 --> 01:28:11,557
Father...

1005
01:28:12,553 --> 01:28:14,362
...if it be possible...

1006
01:28:14,956 --> 01:28:17,459
...let this cup pass me by.

1007
01:28:19,060 --> 01:28:21,062
Yet not as I will...

1008
01:28:21,262 --> 01:28:22,866
...but as Thou wilt.

1009
01:28:28,936 --> 01:28:29,937
What?

1010
01:28:30,338 --> 01:28:33,148
Could none of you
stay awake with me one hour?

1011
01:28:33,608 --> 01:28:36,646
Stay awake and be spared the test.

1012
01:28:36,844 --> 01:28:39,586
The spirit is willing,
but the flesh is weak!

1013
01:28:40,281 --> 01:28:43,160
Everyone else may fall away
on your account.

1014
01:28:43,484 --> 01:28:45,589
But I never will.

1015
01:28:45,787 --> 01:28:47,528
I never will.

1016
01:28:47,955 --> 01:28:48,831
I tell you this!

1017
01:28:50,992 --> 01:28:55,372
Tonight, before the cock crows,
you'll betray me three times!

1018
01:29:01,102 --> 01:29:04,242
Father, if it be not possible
for this cup to pass me by...

1019
01:29:04,439 --> 01:29:06,385
...without my drinking from it...

1020
01:29:06,574 --> 01:29:07,746
...Thy...

1021
01:29:08,443 --> 01:29:09,615
...will...

1022
01:29:10,611 --> 01:29:11,954
...be done.

1023
01:29:18,152 --> 01:29:21,224
Man does not live by bread alone,
but on every word God utters.

1024
01:29:21,422 --> 01:29:24,335
If you are the Son of God,
throw yourself down.

1025
01:29:24,525 --> 01:29:27,472
Scriptures say,
"He will send angels to support you."

1026
01:29:27,662 --> 01:29:30,370
Thou shall not tempt
the Lord your God!

1027
01:29:30,565 --> 01:29:33,705
All these things I will give you...

1028
01:29:33,901 --> 01:29:37,144
...if you will pay me homage.

1029
01:29:38,306 --> 01:29:41,150
Be gone, Satan!

1030
01:30:06,067 --> 01:30:09,207
You shall do homage
to the Lord your God...

1031
01:30:09,704 --> 01:30:12,981
...and worship Him alone.

1032
01:31:29,083 --> 01:31:30,084
Friend...

1033
01:31:31,619 --> 01:31:33,155
...do quickly what you have to do.

1034
01:32:27,475 --> 01:32:31,082
Put down the sword! He who lives
by the sword dies by the sword.

1035
01:32:31,279 --> 01:32:33,850
Do you not suppose I could
appeal to my Father...

1036
01:32:34,048 --> 01:32:36,187
...who'd at once send
12 legions of angels?

1037
01:32:36,384 --> 01:32:38,022
Do you take me for a bandit...

1038
01:32:38,219 --> 01:32:41,223
...that you come after me
with swords and cudgels?

1039
01:32:41,422 --> 01:32:44,801
Daily I taught in the synagogue.
You didn't come after me then.

1040
01:32:48,029 --> 01:32:50,031
But all this has happened...

1041
01:32:50,231 --> 01:32:53,474
...to fulfill what the prophets
have written.

1042
01:33:09,684 --> 01:33:12,528

1043
01:33:13,421 --> 01:33:17,699
