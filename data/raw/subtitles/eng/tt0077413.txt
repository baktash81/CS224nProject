2
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:43,174
- Hey!
- It's her. The Ridgeway girl.

3
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:48,142
- Nice.
- Some of us have to work for a living.

4
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:07,453
Daisy! Back into line.

5
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,400
Welcome to Wode Hall, Miss Ridgeway.

6
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,364
We all hope you will be very happy here.

7
00:04:44,493 --> 00:04:47,155
Thank you, Barnstaple. I know I shall.

8
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:50,780
Perhaps you would care
to meet the staff, miss?

9
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:55,501
Later. I want to see what progress
we've made with the grounds.

10
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:57,540
The architect isn't here yet, miss.

11
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:00,463
Now, Barnstaple.

12
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:03,584
Very good, miss.

13
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:12,889
<i>- Jackie!</i>
- Linnet!

14
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,932
- Jackie!
- Oh, Linny!

15
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:19,563
I'm sorry. That fool of a butler
didn't tell me.

16
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:21,651
Oh, no. It's alright, it's alright.☻

17
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,568
- You look marvellous.
- Thank you. So do you, as always.

18
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:26,815
Where should I serve the tea,
<i>Mademoiselle</i>?

19
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:29,193
- Put it in the drawing room.
- <i>Oui, Mademoiselle</i>.

20
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,867
- Let's go upstairs and freshen up.
- What's the matter with Louise?

21
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:39,120
Man trouble, what else? She wants
to get married. To an Egyptian, no less.

22
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:42,544
She knew absolutely nothing about him,
so I had him checked out.

23
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,917
- And?
- He had a wife already.

24
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:47,795
- So you put a stop to it.
- You bet I did.

25
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:50,093
I told her she couldn't look to me
for a dowry,

26
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:53,308
and naturally he wouldn't touch her
without one. Men!

27
00:05:54,604 --> 00:06:00,646
- Oh, Linnet! Oh! It's beautiful!
- I'm so glad you like it.

28
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:04,111
Listen, Linnet. I've got something
to tell you, and a favour to ask.

29
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:07,197
- Well, anything, you know that.
- No, no, this is serious.

30
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:11,785
- I'm engaged.
- Jackie! Oh, that's wonderful!

31
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:13,824
- Will you give him a job?
- A job?

32
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:16,494
Here, at Wode Hall. Please.

33
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:19,664
Don't you think you should tell me
something about him first?

34
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:24,541
Well, his name is Simon,
Simon Doyle, and he's...

35
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:27,634
Oh, he's everything
I've ever dreamed of.

36
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:30,429
Jackie...

37
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:32,594
- Isn't it lovely?
- Yes, it's beautiful.

38
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:35,093
- It is, isn't it?
- Trouble is, he's broke.

39
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:39,187
- That makes two of us.
- These shoes are killing me.

40
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:43,435
But he loves the country
and a job here would be just ideal.

41
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:47,859
Oh Linnet, I'll die if I can't marry him.
I really will, I'll just die.

42
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:50,449
- You have got it badly.
- I know.

43
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:55,196
- Alright. What do you want me to do?
- Well, you've got this huge place.

44
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:57,869
You're going to need someone
to run it for you. Simon!

45
00:06:58,001 --> 00:07:00,493
- But I need someone with experience.
- But, listen...

46
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:03,963
he studied Estate Management
at Cambridge. He's very bright.

47
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,878
I'll tell you what.
If you don't like him, you can fire him.

48
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:09,001
But you will, I know you will.

49
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:11,720
Alright.
Why don't you bring him down tomorrow?

50
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,510
- And I'll have a look at him.
- Thank you!

51
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:17,601
- Jackie!
- Bye-bye!

52
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:25,062
I just don't want to feel
a fool.

53
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:29,735
Don't worry. Linnet promised.
Well, almost.

54
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:35,361
- I think Linnet may not even like me.
- Nonsense. She'll adore you!

55
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:38,205
And you're perfect for the job. Perfect.

56
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,700
Well, I'll do my best
not to let you down.

57
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:45,545
Oh, Simon, I do love you.
You make me so happy!

58
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:51,173
- We'll honeymoon in Egypt.
- You always said we'd go to Egypt.

59
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:16,360
Hello! Linnet!

60
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,487
Oh, Linny. Here he is.

61
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:21,081
- Come on.
- Hang on, darling.

62
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:22,324
Here he is.

63
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,285
My Simon.

64
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,465
Hello.

65
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:33,590
Jackie's told me so much about you.

66
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:36,089
Isn't he perfect?
Isn't he, Linny?

67
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:44,138
Yes, I think he'll do very well.

68
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:49,734
<i>I told you.</i>

69
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:07,078
<i>Linnet Ridgeway marries penniless
Prince Charming after whirlwind romance.</i>

70
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:10,296
They plan to honeymoon in Egypt.
Jesus-H.-Christ!

71
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:14,168
Don't you mean Tut-Ankh-Amun?
Well, what the hell do we do?

72
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:20,766
The Bremen sails tonight.
I can just get on.

73
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:23,056
What, and try fixing
those British lawyers?

74
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:25,429
- No, you dope.
- Then what?

75
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:30,188
I'll go to Egypt.
Hell, she's gonna be there for a month.

76
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:33,358
"Why, Uncle Andrew!"

77
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:36,107
A chance meeting.
I'm over there on a trip.

78
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:39,200
Honeymoon lovers,
she's not thinking too clear.

79
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:41,070
Get the picture?

80
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:44,039
Look, Linnet's no fool, Pennington.

81
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:47,876
Neither am I!

82
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:55,672
Well, you have a nice trip,
wicked Uncle Andrew.

83
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:00,930
So that's the Ridgeway girl.

84
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:03,847
What are you studying so closely?

85
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:07,187
Her picture? Or her pearls?

86
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:12,435
Keep a civil tongue in your head,
Bowers, or you'll be out of a job.

87
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:13,981
What do I care?

88
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:17,944
This town is filled with
rich old widows

89
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:20,909
willing to pay for a little
grovelling and a body massage.

90
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,869
You go ahead and fire me.

91
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:28,538
Temper, temper, Bowers!
It's obvious you need a holiday.

92
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:34,419
How would a little trip
down the Nile suit you?

93
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:37,293
There's nothing I would
dislike more.

94
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:40,921
If there's two things in the world
I can't abide, it's heat and heathens.

95
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,923
Good, then we'll go.

96
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,845
Bowers, pack!

97
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:29,405
Why don't they put
an escalator in these things?

98
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,451
- Lazybones!
- Lazybones?

99
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:34,747
Don't you know it's better
to travel hopefully than to arrive?

100
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:38,709
What a view!

101
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:43,467
- Happy, darling?
- Silly.

102
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:47,305
- We must be the happiest people alive.
- And the prettiest.

103
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:51,051
- And the luckiest.
- And the alonest.

104
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:52,928
Just us and no one else.

105
00:12:57,652 --> 00:13:00,815
The Neter Menkaure pyramid
is 204 feet high.

106
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:03,860
Each side of the base
is 356 and one half feet.

107
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:06,905
- Jackie!
- What the hell are you doing here?

108
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,031
Seeing the sights, like yourselves.

109
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:16,785
But you were at the Danieli in Venice,
and at Brindisi too.

110
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,082
- What a coincidence!
- Jackie, why?

111
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:24,335
She's following us about
deliberately.

112
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,258
Is that true?
Well, it's intolerable!

113
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:30,928
And common. Very, very common.

114
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:35,054
And effective. Very, very effective.

115
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:37,980
Bye-bye.

116
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:27,898
- Bitch! Everywhere we go she pops up.
- Darling...

117
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:32,119
- Like some kangaroo in heat.
- Oh, I can't understand her.

118
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:36,080
- Can't you?
- Oh, I suppose it's my fault.

119
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:38,576
I broke our engagement
and went off with you.

120
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,372
She must be really unhappy.

121
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:43,793
- She's revelling in every minute of it.
- No.

122
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:46,337
Darling.

123
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:53,260
We are the lucky ones.
Don't let Jackie spoil it.

124
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:57,469
I won't.

125
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:59,972
This is the perfect honeymoon.

126
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:01,849
No one's gonna wreck it for us.

127
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:05,814
I love you.

128
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,526
I'll race you back.

129
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:28,647
- Colonel Race!
- Poirot!

130
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:31,146
Oh, I'm *enchanted to see you!

131
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:33,899
- Oh, my old friend! How capital!
- Yes.

132
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:36,197
Oh, I haven't clapped eyes on you
since...

133
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:38,991
Oh, that strange affair of the
decapitated clergyman.

134
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,488
- Yes, yes. - Mind you, I still think
you were a trifle lucky

135
00:16:41,494 --> 00:16:43,867
to find that cake knife
up the chimney, like that.

136
00:16:43,873 --> 00:16:46,996
Lucky? With me it's the exercise
of the little grey cells.

137
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:49,338
Luck, I leave to the others.

138
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:52,300
Yes, I'd forgotten
your opinions about yourself.

139
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:54,385
Might one ask,
what are you doing here?

140
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:56,175
I'm on <i>les *vacances.</i>
(vacation)

141
00:16:56,307 --> 00:17:00,050
Shortly I'm going up the Nile
on the steamer. And you?

142
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:01,551
Oh, the same, oddly enough.

143
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,600
Oh. In other words, you're
following one of the passengers.

144
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:07,815
No, no. *<i>Seulement les vacances, mon ami.</i>
(Just a vacation)

145
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:09,480
Oh!

146
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:11,774
- Like yourself.
- Yes.

147
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:18,568
This chair is free, eh?

148
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:21,321
In this world, comrade,
nothing's free.

149
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:24,119
- <i>Bitte?<i/>
- Forget it. Sit down.

150
00:17:24,252 --> 00:17:29,042
- <i>Danke.</i> You are reading <i>Das Kapital?</i>
- Yes. Never travel without it.

151
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:35,048
Dr. Ludwig Bessner.
Of the Bessner Institute, Zurich.

152
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:37,341
Jim Ferguson, citizen of the world.

153
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:42,467
- You are on holiday, perhaps, eh?
- No.

154
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:46,141
I'm observing the decline
of the capitalist system, my friend.

155
00:17:46,274 --> 00:17:49,687
<i>Oh,</i> indeed!

156
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:53,687
Well, you've got
a good specimen there, eh?

157
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:56,006
The young <i>Kaugummi</i> heiress.
(chewing gum)

158
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:57,029
That parasite?

159
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:59,867
- You don't approve?
- She makes me sick.

160
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:03,322
In any decent society...

161
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:06,620
Ah, you may be right.

162
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:09,960
She has altogether too much power.

163
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:13,047
- <i>Monsieur.
- Shukran jazeelan.</i> (Thanks v. much)

164
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:17,506
*<i>cin cin!</i> [IT]

165
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:27,266
- Linnet? Linnet, honey!
- Uncle Andrew!

166
00:18:27,398 --> 00:18:30,516
What a surprise! I didn't know
you were travelling in Egypt!

167
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:34,690
Well, it's very sudden. As a matter
of fact, I'm on my honeymoon.

168
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:38,941
Your honeymoon? What do you know!
Is this the lucky young man?

169
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:43,661
Darling, this is my American lawyer
and trustee, Andrew Pennington.

170
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,655
Simon. Simon Doyle.

171
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,748
- Pleased to meet you, sir.
- How do you do?

172
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:49,993
- Won't you join us?
- Well, just for a moment.

173
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:53,338
But don't worry.
I'm not going to intrude.

174
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:55,924
I know how young people are.

175
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:58,339
The *cynosure of all eyes.
(focal point)

176
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:02,260
Even you, with your English reserve,
gaze.

177
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:05,509
- She's very beautiful.
- Oh, she's very rich.

178
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:08,053
You know who she is, of course.
- Of course. - Yes.

179
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:12,183
Do forgive me for butting in,
but I have a bet with my daughter here,

180
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:15,731
that you're Hercules Porridge,
the famous French sleuth.

181
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:19,401
Not quite. I am Hercule Poirot,
the famous 'Belgian' sleut(h)*.

182
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:22,275
I told you, Rosalie.

183
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:26,951
There's only one <i>Monsieur</i> Poirot
in the world. He's unmistakable.

184
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,916
As indeed, I realise I am, myself.

185
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:32,536
My mother is Salome Otterbourne,
the novelist.

186
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:36,757
Otter... Salo... Of course.
<i>Natrellement. Enchanté.</i>

187
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:39,967
So here we are,
two famous people in one plaoe.

188
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:43,384
- Oh, three, surely.

189
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:47,601
I was talking about genius,
not mere money, <i>Monsieur</i>.

190
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:51,437
Oh, you know Colonel Race,
my old friend?

191
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:54,683
This is... and her daughter...

192
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:56,355
Charmed, simply charmed.

193
00:19:56,487 --> 00:19:58,979
Please, sit down, <i>Madame, Mademoiselle.</i>

194
00:20:00,326 --> 00:20:01,784
<i>Voila</i>.

195
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:05,284
You're probably working on
some other book now, <i>Madame</i>.

196
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:07,404
Set in Egypt, perhaps?

197
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:12,080
How thrillingly clever of you
to deduce that, <i>Monsieur</i> Porridge!

198
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:16,045
I am here to absorb local colour
for my grand opus,

199
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:19,131
<i>Snow on the Sphinx' Face.</i>

200
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:22,423
Frozen enigma turns
to incandescent love

201
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:26,469
as this young English girl from
Haslemere, scarcely out of school,

202
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:31,015
melts the barbarous heart
of a cruel desert sheikh.

203
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:33,138
Somehow, I don't think
<i>Monsieur</i> Poirot

204
00:20:33,274 --> 00:20:35,606
is a very keen reader
of romantic novels, Mother.

205
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:41,572
Of course he is. All Frenchmen are.
They're not afraid of good, strong sex!

206
00:20:41,699 --> 00:20:46,114
Unlike, I might say, most of
our leading lending libraries.

207
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,282
They have banned
Salome Otterbourne

208
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:51,702
for speaking the truth
about men and women.

209
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:53,745
But she goes on, nonetheless.

210
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:58,964
The truth, yes. The truth.
It's so difficult to tell.

211
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,165
Thank you, <i>Monsieur</i>.

212
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:11,643
Well, perhaps you would
join me in a tango, er, <i>Mademoiselle</i>?

213
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:15,685
A little exercise after dinner.

214
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:23,522
- Do you tango, Colonel?
- Poorly, I'm afraid, Mrs. Otterbourne.

215
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:25,819
Then I shall teach you
to do it correctly,

216
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:28,909
as it was done in old Spain,
when it was known as the "cheeker",

217
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:32,156
that is to say,
with a sensuous, erotic dash.

218
00:22:28,389 --> 00:22:31,177
Damn it, Jackie!
Can't you leave us alone?

219
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:36,552
Waiter.

220
00:22:56,834 --> 00:23:00,372
<i>Monsieur</i> Poirot!
<i>Monsieur</i> Poirot!

221
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:26,860
I saw you with Linnet
this morning.

222
00:23:26,989 --> 00:23:28,980
How much is she paying you
to warn me off?

223
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:32,154
No, no. I accepted no commission
from <i>Madame</i> Doyle, nor will I.

224
00:23:32,286 --> 00:23:34,527
What I have to say to you
is in pure friendship.

225
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:37,826
Oh, yes? And what would
you like to say?

226
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:41,826
That I'm making a public show of myself?
That I'm crazy?

227
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:44,419
I say bury the dead.

228
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:47,040
Not as the Egyptians do,

229
00:23:47,176 --> 00:23:50,919
preserving the body in order to ensure
the immortality of the soul.

230
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:54,548
No. Properly, finally.
Turn your back on the past.

231
00:23:54,683 --> 00:24:00,520
Look only fonlvard.
Remember, time heals everything.

232
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:04,682
If you think I'm suffering,
you're quite wrong.

233
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:07,025
Actually, I'm rather
enjoying myself.

234
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:11,364
Yes. Your pleasure is the very worst
part of it, <i>Mademoiselle</i>.

235
00:24:12,743 --> 00:24:16,407
I don't care.
Simon was mine and he loved me.

236
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:18,154
Then she came along and...

237
00:24:24,338 --> 00:24:26,204
It's only a tiny thing...

238
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:28,630
...but it's lethal.

239
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:32,551
And my father taught me
to be a crack shot.

240
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:41,303
Sometimes, I swear I'll put this gun
right against her head,

241
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:45,147
and then ever so gently
pull the trigger.

242
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:50,815
When I hear that sound
more and more...

243
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:57,945
I know how you feel.
We all feel like that at times.

244
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,866
Only, I warn you, <i>Mademoiselle</i>...

245
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:06,123
Do not allow evil into your heart.
It will make a home there.

246
00:25:07,548 --> 00:25:12,167
If love can't live there,
evil will do just as well.

247
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:18,469
Oh. How... How sad, <i>Mademoiselle</i>.

248
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:31,727
Hello, Mr. P.!

249
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:35,072
- You're going back to the hotel?
- Where else?

250
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,283
Look. It's a surprise for Linnet.
Do you think she'll like it?

251
00:25:38,412 --> 00:25:42,076
- That depends. Does she smoke?
- Just Craven "A".

252
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:45,913
By the way... Have you had a chance
to talk to Jackie yet?

253
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:47,752
Yes, just a few moments ago.

254
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,668
Well, good. I hope you got
her to see some sense.

255
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:55,043
Alas, to her,
sense is perpetual revenge.

256
00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:58,717
- Are you serious?
- I'm always serious, <i>mon ami</i>.

257
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:05,223
Jackie's stubborn, I know,
and damn possessive.

258
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:07,847
- But surely...
- Did she want to possess you?

259
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:11,271
Well, I suppose so. Yes, she did.

260
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:13,815
But she has a hell of a temper
and a mind of her own.

261
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:15,529
She wishes to wear the trousers.

262
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:18,524
Yes. And a man can't have that,
can he, Mr. P.?

263
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,617
<i>No, no, ne peut pas.</i>

264
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:25,664
You know, when I first met Linnet...
Well, how should I put it?

265
00:26:25,793 --> 00:26:29,502
It was like the moon after sunrise. You
just don't notice it's there any more.

266
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:32,213
After I met her,
Jackie just didn't exist.

267
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:35,049
Yes. Some women have that power.

268
00:26:35,177 --> 00:26:38,215
But how are you going to find
a way out of your present dilemma?

269
00:26:38,347 --> 00:26:41,965
Well, I have the most marvellous plan
and it's absolutely foolproof.

00:34:10,924 --> 00:34:13,416
The oyster nearly dies.

330
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:18,671
Come along now. Back to the cabin.
Time for your massage.

331
00:34:18,807 --> 00:34:20,389
My companion, Bowers.

332
00:34:20,517 --> 00:34:23,179
She did 15 rounds once
with Jack Dempsey.

333
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:25,894
He was never the same man again.

334
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:30,812
- Sorry, Miss Ridgeway.
- Mrs. Doyle. Mrs. Simon Doyle.

335
00:34:30,944 --> 00:34:32,810
You have got to forgive Miss Bowers.

336
00:34:32,946 --> 00:34:36,484
She's just unfamiliar
with the married state.

337
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:39,449
- I saw you drooling over her pearls.
- Shut up, Bowers.

338
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:42,491
You'd give every tooth in your head
to lay your hands on them.

339
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:43,453
What nonsense!

340
00:34:43,582 --> 00:34:47,291
Just because you've got a grudge against her,
or rather her father, no need to be uncivil.

341
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:51,629
Grudge?!
Melhuish Ridgeway ruined my family.

342
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:53,963
Well, you should be grateful.

343
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:57,630
If he hadn't, you'd have missed
the pleasure of working for me.

344
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:01,130
I could kill her on that score alone.

345
00:35:04,561 --> 00:35:05,801
Tea, <i>Madame?</i>

346
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:13,684
I am Salome Otterbourne
and I must have a word.

347
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:16,983
I thought we were already having words;
through our lawyers.

348
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:20,483
It is about that
that I have come to supplicate.

349
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:21,529
Supplicate?

350
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:24,619
I mean to entreat, or to appeal,
if you like.

351
00:35:24,748 --> 00:35:28,867
I'm afraid we authors are
a little ﬂowery in our speech.

352
00:35:29,002 --> 00:35:31,619
And defamatory in our writing.

353
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:38,005
I'm sorry you should have taken
<u>Passion Under the Persimmon Tree</u> that way.

354
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:42,004
I assure you the intention was
merely to show a young girl's heart

355
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,973
beginning to beat
to the primordial drum.

356
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:51,013
Can't you see, my dear, that what
I wrote was really quite ﬂattering?

357
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,856
Frankly, Mrs. Otterbourne,

358
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:58,104
I don't consider being likened
to a nymphomaniacal baboon, ﬂattering.

359
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:02,233
And I suggest we leave it to our lawyers
to decide what is adequate compensation

360
00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:04,326
for being the butt
of your vulgar drivel!

361
00:36:04,454 --> 00:36:07,947
- Good afternoon.
- Philistine!

362
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:11,417
I'll show you what reputation
is about!

363
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:38,444
- I'm sorry to intrude.
- Uncle Andrew.

364
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:41,438
But these are the papers,
I told you, needed signing.

365
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,441
The lease on the Chrysler Building...

366
00:36:45,662 --> 00:36:50,202
Ah, let's see, the silver mine
concessions, Baku oil transfers

367
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:53,621
and the Corn Crisp/Choo-chew merger.

368
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:07,639
Just sign on the last page,
right on the bottom, my dear.

369
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:10,008
But, Uncle Andrew,
I haven't even read it yet.

370
00:37:10,145 --> 00:37:13,479
There's no need, there's no need.
It's all quite straightforward.

371
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:16,268
Checked and double checked by me.

372
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:18,893
But I always read everything
through before I sign.

373
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:20,814
My father taught me that.

374
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:24,065
He always said never to trust anyone.
Not even your own lawyers.

375
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:27,158
Dear old Melhuish.
What a sense of humour!

376
00:37:27,287 --> 00:37:30,871
Well, as far as I'm concerned, I've
never read a legal document in my life.

377
00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:32,865
I certainly don't intend to start now.

378
00:37:34,294 --> 00:37:35,204
You don't say.

379
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:39,295
- Isn't that a little feckless, darling?
- Yes, absolutely.

380
00:37:39,424 --> 00:37:41,791
But I'm dying for a Manhattan,
aren't you?

381
00:37:42,844 --> 00:37:46,087
Alright.
Seeing we're on our honeymoon.

382
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:47,462
That's a girl.

383
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:53,052
Now, the next one.

384
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:57,268
I do hope I'm not, er, butting in.
I'm a lawyer.

385
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,643
I just wanted to say how much I admire
your businesslike attitude.

386
00:38:00,779 --> 00:38:04,898
Your father was absolutely right. Never
sign a document until you've read it.

387
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:06,819
I'm sure you agree, sir.

388
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:11,036
Er, sure. Sure. There's no hurry.

389
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,866
Well, now, if you'll excuse me.

390
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:23,465
I hope I've not given offence.

391
00:38:23,593 --> 00:38:25,004
What if you have, Mr...?

392
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:28,094
- Race. Colonel Race.
- What if you have, Colonel?

393
00:38:28,223 --> 00:38:30,464
Lawyers are trained
to deal with offences.

394
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:33,642
Would you join us for a drink
in the bar?

395
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:36,808
- Thank you. Most kind.
- And what about you, Mr. P.?

396
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:39,022
After all,
there's cause for celebration.

397
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:41,767
As you see, my plan to lose Jackie
worked like a charm.

398
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:45,612
Yes, so it would, <i>er...</i>
so it would seem.

399
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,651
Congratulations.
(*<i>Mes félicitations.</i>)

400
00:38:47,784 --> 00:38:50,526
Colonel Race and
will join you in a, er...

401
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:54,112
...moment.

402
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:55,580
Darling?

403
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,332
- <i>Madame</i>, I must talk with you.
- Later, Louise.

404
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:07,835
- No, now! It's important.
- I'll see you in the bar.

405
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:11,675
- Well?
- I've received a cable.

406
00:39:11,808 --> 00:39:14,516
My fiancé has sent his woman
back to her people.

407
00:39:14,644 --> 00:39:17,557
He's waiting for me.
I must go to him.

408
00:39:17,689 --> 00:39:20,181
Please, give me the money
that you promised me.

409
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:22,478
I've been with you for five years now.

410
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:28,026
- It's completely out of the question.
- <i>Madame</i>, you promised me.

411
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:32,071
- He's still married, Louise.
- I implore you.

412
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:35,992
I need that money as a dowry.
I've worked hard for you.

413
00:39:36,124 --> 00:39:39,116
And you'll continue to do so
until I say otherwise.

414
00:39:39,252 --> 00:39:42,961
- <i>Madame</i>, you can't refuse me.
- Thank you, Louise.

415
00:39:45,258 --> 00:39:46,544
*<i>Chameau!</i> (Camel!)

416
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:53,717
*<i>Mon Dieu</i>, how she makes
enemies of them all. (My God)

417
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:56,558
Even her own lawyer
is trying to cheat her?

418
00:39:56,686 --> 00:39:58,927
You old fox! So you noticed?

419
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:01,725
Well, I knew that you weren't here...
How was it again?

420
00:40:01,858 --> 00:40:04,946
<i>"Seulement pour les vacances,
mon ami"</i>.(Mock accent)

421
00:40:05,987 --> 00:40:07,318
Yes, I suppose I can tell you.

422
00:40:07,447 --> 00:40:10,690
*<i>Sub Rosa</i>, I am working
for Mrs. Doyle's English lawyers,

423
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:13,692
and they suspect Andrew Pennington
of... well, of...

424
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:16,445
- Embezzling her money.
- That's about the size of it.

425
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:18,743
You see, under the terms
of the father's will,

426
00:40:18,875 --> 00:40:22,539
she gets control of the money when
she marries, and as she has recently married...

427
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,581
He is trying to get her
to sign a document

428
00:40:24,714 --> 00:40:26,330
which will get him out of the soup.

429
00:40:26,466 --> 00:40:28,958
Exactly. I think I've scared him off
for the moment,

430
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:31,425
but who knows what he'll try next?

431
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:33,966
Or any of them, for that matter.

432
00:42:44,479 --> 00:42:47,471
"Inside the Great Temple of Karnak,

433
00:42:47,607 --> 00:42:52,852
we pass the pedestals
of numerous small rams." <i>Ja</i>.

434
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:58,448
"Each with a small image
of Amenophis III in front of it." Yeah.

435
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:00,943
Oh, yes, rams.

436
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:05,164
Lickerish, priapic, ruttish rams!

437
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:06,531
How noble they are!

438
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:12,629
With their proud ﬂanks, ﬂared nostrils
and unashamed curled horns.

439
00:43:12,757 --> 00:43:15,465
<i>Ja. Ja.</i>,
Come, <i>Fraulein</i>, come.

440
00:43:19,472 --> 00:43:23,511
You know, Karl Marx said that
religion was the opium of the people.

441
00:43:23,643 --> 00:43:25,805
For your mother,
it's obviously sex.

442
00:43:25,937 --> 00:43:27,894
Don't you think you'd better
calm her down a little?

443
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:30,229
She'd do one of those beasts
a fearful injury.

444
00:43:30,358 --> 00:43:32,816
Look, Mr. Ferguson, my mother
may be a figure of fun for you,

445
00:43:32,944 --> 00:43:34,776
but she still happens to be my mother.

446
00:43:34,904 --> 00:43:39,068
She kept me marvellously in better days.
I'm not going to desert her now that...

447
00:43:40,535 --> 00:43:42,776
- Now that what?
- Nothing.

448
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:46,913
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to be nosy.

449
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:49,248
And I certainly didn't mean
to offend you.

450
00:43:49,377 --> 00:43:51,994
Honestly, Miss Otlerbourne,
I am not as bad as I look.

451
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:54,041
- Aren't you?
- Scout's honour?

452
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:04,006
- Would you mind offending her?
- Linnet Ridgeway's a leech.

453
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:06,008
A parasite on the skin of society.

454
00:44:06,144 --> 00:44:07,760
For God's sake, in a sane world,

455
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:10,102
she'd be bumped off
as a warning to the others.

456
00:44:10,231 --> 00:44:11,892
- Bumped off?
- That's what I said.

457
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:15,316
- Mr. Ferguson?
- Jim.

458
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:18,653
Jim, is it true
you can't libel the dead?

459
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:23,279
I'm not sure I understand the question.

460
00:44:23,411 --> 00:44:24,401
Never mind.

461
00:44:24,537 --> 00:44:29,623
Oh, look, isn't it wonderful!
Quite beyond comprehension!

462
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:32,367
Ah, the artistic temperament,
<i>Monsieur</i> Pennington.

463
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:35,291
What strange forms it takes!

464
00:44:35,423 --> 00:44:38,415
I'm afraid that doesn't much
concern me, <i>Monsieur</i> Poirot.

465
00:44:38,551 --> 00:44:41,259
I confine myself
to the world of facts and figures.

466
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:44,596
The ancient Egyptians felt
quite at home with facts and figures.

467
00:44:44,724 --> 00:44:47,261
The Grand vizier Ptahhotep

468
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:51,512
was crushed to death
under a thousand pieces of silver

469
00:44:51,647 --> 00:44:54,856
because he embezzled
his master's treasury.

470
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:58,811
- You don't say?
- Oh, yes.

471
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:28,774
God! You alright?
Linnet, you alright?

472
00:48:30,366 --> 00:48:32,983
Come on. Easy.

473
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:36,157
That's it, come on, up you come.
Alright?

474
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:39,618
What happened?

475
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:42,583
That stone must have fallen
or was pushed.

476
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:46,955
- To kill me?
- Jackie!

477
00:48:48,259 --> 00:48:49,920
But she's not here!

478
00:49:17,121 --> 00:49:19,237
Oh, my poor <i>Madame</i>,
that was a close shave.

479
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:21,740
- It could've been a nasty accident.
- Accident?

480
00:49:21,876 --> 00:49:23,992
That stone has been up there
for 4,000 years.

481
00:49:24,128 --> 00:49:27,371
It chooses the moment to fall, when
there are people underneath it? No.

482
00:49:27,506 --> 00:49:30,248
Not exactly 4,000 years, <i>Herr</i> Poirot.

483
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:34,378
- These pillars were built in 1788...
- We all agree with you, <i>Herr</i> Bessner.

484
00:49:34,513 --> 00:49:36,675
You may have a patient on your hands.
Please.

485
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:40,266
Oh, most negligent of me!
<i>Ja, ja</i>, here.

486
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:41,725
I'm alright. Really I am.

487
00:49:41,854 --> 00:49:45,848
<i>Ja, ja,</i> but I think maybe you go back
to the boat, you take a little rest, eh?

488
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:49,977
Alright. But only for a
couple of hours, doctor.

489
00:49:50,112 --> 00:49:52,854
I must see the Temple of Abu Simbel
this evening.

490
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:55,778
Oh, that is most extraordinary.

491
00:49:55,910 --> 00:50:00,245
Did you know that the easternmost figure
is the famous Vocal Statue?

492
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:02,158
- Really?
- <i>Ja</i>.

493
00:50:02,291 --> 00:50:05,283
Then we must be there in time.
Thank you, doctor.

494
00:50:06,504 --> 00:50:09,587
At sunset it emits a sad,
plaintive note.

495
00:50:09,715 --> 00:50:12,173
- He scares me.
- Oh, he's harmless.

496
00:50:44,625 --> 00:50:47,492
My God, it's fantastic.

497
00:50:47,628 --> 00:50:50,541
I think they're frightening.

498
00:50:50,673 --> 00:50:52,129
No, they're not.

499
00:51:01,809 --> 00:51:03,470
Do you think he'll sing
a note for me?

500
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:06,560
Why not? You're divine.

501
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:41,964
Welcome to the Temple of Abu Simbel.
The facade is 84 feet long.

502
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:46,639
Each of the statues of Ramesses II
is 65 feet high.

503
00:51:49,898 --> 00:51:55,735
Get away from me! Get away!
Get away from me!

504
00:51:55,863 --> 00:51:59,572
OK, darling!
Don't let her spoil everything.

505
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:38,774
So you could not bury your dead.
You cannot stay away.

506
00:52:38,906 --> 00:52:41,147
Nope, I can't keep away.

507
00:52:41,283 --> 00:52:44,901
You didn't really think I'd be fooled
by any trick Simon could invent?

508
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:50,118
I'm very sorry to see you here,
<i>Mademoiselle</i>.

509
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:51,456
Forgive me for saying so,

510
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:55,499
but you're embarking on
a hazardous journey in troubled waters.

511
00:52:55,631 --> 00:52:59,920
You face who knows
what currents of misfortune.

512
00:53:00,052 --> 00:53:02,919
- Why do you say that?
- Because it's the truth.

513
00:53:03,055 --> 00:53:06,423
You're cutting the last bonds
which bind you to safety.

514
00:53:07,476 --> 00:53:10,013
You can still turn back
if you really want to.

515
00:53:11,814 --> 00:53:15,023
One must follow one's star
wherever it leads.

516
00:53:15,984 --> 00:53:20,273
- Even to disaster?
- Even to hell itself.

517
00:53:30,165 --> 00:53:33,374
I left my bag in the bar.
I'll join you in a minute, darling.

518
00:53:45,389 --> 00:53:49,678
Well... We are alone, <i>mein Frau</i>.

519
00:53:49,810 --> 00:53:54,145
The opportunity to talk to you in
private has not presented itself before.

520
00:53:55,399 --> 00:53:59,358
- What do we have to talk about?
- My reputation, <i>Frau</i> Doyle.

521
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:03,779
- You ran that institute in Zurich.
- That is so.

522
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:06,820
And you have been saying
so many unpleasant things about me

523
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:10,240
to people of influence
and position.

524
00:54:10,372 --> 00:54:12,204
- I say you're a quack.
- <i>Frau</i> Doyle!

525
00:54:12,332 --> 00:54:14,969
- - What's more, you're a dangerous quack.
- Now, listen to me!

526
00:54:15,002 --> 00:54:18,085
My good friend Myra Seligman
listened to you. Too well!

527
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:21,046
And allowed you to give her
those filthy injections.

528
00:54:21,175 --> 00:54:24,543
I prescribed a course
of armadillo urine.

529
00:54:24,678 --> 00:54:28,763
<i>Ja</i>, I had used it previously
with great success.

530
00:54:28,891 --> 00:54:32,429
In the case of poor Myra,
she went barking mad, thanks to you.

531
00:54:32,561 --> 00:54:33,892
I will not allow this.

532
00:54:34,021 --> 00:54:37,605
These irresponsible remarks
about my treatment have got to stop!

533
00:54:37,733 --> 00:54:40,521
Then sue me, if you dare.

534
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:42,859
Now, you know that is impossible.

535
00:54:42,988 --> 00:54:46,526
Any scandal attached to my clinic
would bring instant ruin.

536
00:54:46,658 --> 00:54:49,150
Then it's rather your funeral,
isn't it?

537
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:54,701
Well, let's hope that
it is not yours!

538
00:54:54,833 --> 00:54:58,417
Do you want a <i>crème de cacao</i>
or a cognac, perhaps?

539
00:54:58,545 --> 00:55:01,003
The service upstairs is so slow.

540
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:03,463
<i>Nein... Danke.</i>

541
00:55:24,947 --> 00:55:26,563
What time is it?

542
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:31,534
There's a clock. Use your eyes.

543
00:55:31,662 --> 00:55:34,996
Didn't your mother ever tell you,
as far as servants are concerned,

544
00:55:35,123 --> 00:55:36,659
there is a vast difference

545
00:55:36,792 --> 00:55:40,160
between amiable eccentricity
and downright rudeness?

546
00:55:40,295 --> 00:55:41,456
My mother was a Lady.

547
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:43,704
A disposition she failed
to pass on to you.

548
00:55:43,841 --> 00:55:45,081
It's your bedtime.

549
00:55:45,217 --> 00:55:48,335
- Very well. Where's my stole?
- I haven't seen it.

550
00:55:49,638 --> 00:55:51,970
- You sure you had it with you?
- Of course I'm sure.

551
00:55:52,099 --> 00:55:55,057
- Well, I haven't seen it anywhere.
- Use your eyes.

552
00:55:59,106 --> 00:56:00,972
<i>Monsieur</i> Poirot?

553
00:56:03,735 --> 00:56:08,445
I hope one day you'll be able
to tell me about some of your cases.

554
00:56:08,574 --> 00:56:11,532
The... the juicier ones.

555
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:14,072
- Juicier ones?
- Bloodier.

556
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:18,038
Ah! <i>Quand vous voulez, madame.</i>

557
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:22,122
- Goodnight. Goodnight, <i>Monsieur.
- Bon soir.</i>

558
00:56:28,302 --> 00:56:30,760
- Oh! So sorry.
- Oh, no, no, no.

559
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:35,639
You look very sleepy tonight,
<i>Monsieur</i> Porridge.

560
00:56:35,767 --> 00:56:39,852
Yes, I'm extremely.
I am consumed by sleep, <i>Madame</i>.

561
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:44,099
I don't know why, but I can hardly
keep my *(h)eyes (h)open.

562
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:47,192
Naughty. Me, too.

563
00:56:47,321 --> 00:56:50,279
Perhaps you'd be good enough
to escort me to my cabin?

564
00:56:52,367 --> 00:56:54,574
It is this way, as you know.

565
00:56:58,081 --> 00:57:03,326
I suppose that uncouth young man will
appear now and attempt to seduce you.

566
00:57:03,462 --> 00:57:06,921
Well, don't let him succeed
without at least the show of a struggle.

567
00:57:07,049 --> 00:57:11,168
- Remember, the chase is very important.
- Oh, Mother!

568
00:57:12,888 --> 00:57:14,845
No, this way is better.

569
00:57:14,973 --> 00:57:17,635
There's a beastly step here,
which I always trip on.

570
00:57:17,768 --> 00:57:19,429
No, no, that's the river!

571
00:57:27,903 --> 00:57:29,714
No, no, no...

572
00:57:29,747 --> 00:57:32,388
The old Nile is a bit choppy tonight,
<i>monsieur</i>.

573
00:57:32,394 --> 00:57:35,066
It is true.
There are disturbing currents.

574
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:38,077
Here we are. Here we are.

575
00:57:38,205 --> 00:57:40,116
No, no. In there.

576
00:57:40,248 --> 00:57:42,956
<i>- Bonsoir.
- Bonsoir! Bonsoir, madame.</i>

577
00:58:08,026 --> 00:58:09,312
Hello.

578
00:58:11,363 --> 00:58:15,778
- Been ashore?
- Yes. It's lovely in the moonlight.

579
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:17,616

Didn't she have
some fellow's head cut off?

- How is she?

645
01:02:43,176 --> 01:02:46,464
As well as can be expected for a girl
who's just tried to shoot her ex-lover.

646

How can you be so heartless?

647
01:02:50,267 --> 01:02:54,386
There now. Miss Bowers is just coming.
It'll be alright.

648
01:02:54,521 --> 01:02:57,889
- It'll be alright.
- It's Doyle. There's been an accident.

649
01:02:58,024 --> 01:03:00,686
Yes, yes. Miss Otterboure told me.

650
01:03:02,821 --> 01:03:06,359

will meet the case.

that Hun doctor from next door.

653
01:03:15,875 --> 01:03:18,617
- He ought to have a look at Doyle.
- Yes, right.

654
01:03:25,010 --> 01:03:28,878
Bad, this.
Get me one more cloth, <i>ja</i>?

655
01:03:29,014 --> 01:03:30,049
Alright.

656
01:03:35,478 --> 01:03:39,437
The bone is fractured.
There is much losses of blood, <i>ja</i>.

657
01:03:39,566 --> 01:03:43,434
Alright. Alright, alright.

658
01:03:43,570 --> 01:03:45,857
Help me get him to my cabin, <i>ja</i>?

659
01:03:48,516 --> 01:03:51,954
Are you afraid of a little blood
like a young *<i>Mädchen</i>? (girl)

660
01:03:51,986 --> 01:03:54,778
Come here, Ferguson. Help me get him up.

661
01:04:00,295 --> 01:04:03,788
I'll stay with her tonight. You never
know how they're going to react.

662
01:04:05,717 --> 01:04:08,300
- Miss Bowers, is she quiet?
- Yes.

663
01:04:08,428 --> 01:04:11,921
Yes, I've given her some morphia.
I won't leave her.

664
01:04:12,057 --> 01:04:15,516
Ah, good.
Young lady, you come with me, <i>ja</i>?

665
01:04:15,543 --> 01:04:18,160
You'll be more use than
this *<i>Stutzer</i> (dandy) here,

666
01:04:18,396 --> 01:04:20,558
who's afraid at the sight
of a little blood.

667
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:22,146
Open the door. <i>Ja</i>.

668
01:04:26,196 --> 01:04:29,985
Easy, alright, alright. That's it.

669
01:04:30,116 --> 01:04:33,108
Almost... Here we are. <i>Ja</i>.

670
01:04:42,837 --> 01:04:44,043
<i>Ja.</i>

671
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:50,801
Alright. Could you get
a cool towel for the head, <i>ja</i>?

672
01:04:50,929 --> 01:04:52,636
Yes, doctor.

673
01:05:02,565 --> 01:05:05,603
- <i>Ja</i>.
- I'd better go and pick up that gun.

674
01:05:05,735 --> 01:05:08,898
It's not the sort of thing we want
to leave lying around, is it?

675
01:05:09,030 --> 01:05:10,862
- <i>Ja</i>.
- Yes.

676
01:05:10,990 --> 01:05:14,233
Jackie. She mustn't be left alone.

677
01:05:14,369 --> 01:05:16,030
She isn't. Don't worry.

678
01:05:17,288 --> 01:05:23,079
Oh, God. It's all been my fault.
I treated her so badly.

679
01:05:24,295 --> 01:05:27,037
She didn't know what she was doing.
She was drunk.

680
01:05:27,173 --> 01:05:29,210
Now, this is going to hurt.

681
01:05:33,346 --> 01:05:36,134
Are you sure someone
shouldn't tell your wife?

682
01:05:37,684 --> 01:05:40,221
Yes. Yes, please.

683
01:05:41,604 --> 01:05:46,349
No... no, let her sleep.
No need to worry her till morning.

684
01:05:49,279 --> 01:05:52,192
The best I can do is patch it up.

685
01:05:52,323 --> 01:05:56,783
There is no exit wound.
The bullet is lodged deep in there.

686
01:05:56,911 --> 01:06:00,495
<i>Ja</i>, it will have to wait
until we get to Wadi Halfa.

687
01:06:00,623 --> 01:06:02,205
Roll up the sleeve.

688
01:06:02,955 --> 01:06:03,796
*Get.

689
01:06:03,835 --> 01:06:05,746
And swab it with this, eh?

690
01:06:06,754 --> 01:06:11,590
<i>Ja</i>. I will have some splints made.

691
01:06:11,718 --> 01:06:15,757
And then I will set them
when you are asleep, eh?

692
01:06:15,889 --> 01:06:19,883
- Thank you, doctor.
- <i>Ja</i>. Now, don't you worry.

693
01:06:21,227 --> 01:06:23,969
Everything's going to be alright.

694
01:06:30,445 --> 01:06:32,061
It's not there.

695
01:06:34,532 --> 01:06:37,274
- *<i>Was</i>? (What)
- The gun. It's not there.

696
01:06:40,371 --> 01:06:41,782
But who could have taken it?

697
01:06:41,915 --> 01:06:44,873
Search me.
I only hope it's not important.

698
01:07:44,686 --> 01:07:49,601
"Sometimes I want to put
this little gun up to her head,

699
01:07:49,732 --> 01:07:52,599
and very gently pull the trigger."

700
01:07:53,903 --> 01:07:57,271
- *<i>Was</i>? (What)
- Oh, nothing.

701
01:08:01,319 --> 01:08:03,605
I've just seen the manager.
He put the matter in my hands

702
01:08:03,621 --> 01:08:06,534
so it'll be our responsibility
until we reach Wadi Haifa.

703
01:08:06,666 --> 01:08:08,623
Well, I am at your disposal,
of course. - Thank you.

704
01:08:08,751 --> 01:08:11,288
So, doctor, what can you
tell us about this?

705
01:08:11,421 --> 01:08:14,755
She was shot with a very small bullet.

706
01:08:14,882 --> 01:08:19,126
A .22 calibre, I think. And the gun was
held very close to the head.

707
01:08:19,262 --> 01:08:21,924
<i>Here you can see all the *Versengen.</i>

708
01:08:23,016 --> 01:08:25,474
Damn it, man, can't you speak English?

709
01:08:25,602 --> 01:08:29,891
- Oh, you mean the scorching.
- <i>Ja, ja</i>, the scorching.

710
01:08:31,316 --> 01:08:32,852
Excuse me.

711
01:08:43,311 --> 01:08:44,951
*<i>Tiens, tiens, tiens...</i>
(Well, well, well)

712
01:08:46,998 --> 01:08:49,535
- What do you make of that?
- Huh?

713
01:08:49,667 --> 01:08:54,332
Oh, I think it's... I think it's easy.
You see, <i>Madame</i> Doyle was dying.

714
01:08:54,464 --> 01:08:56,876
She wished to identify
the murderer to us,

715
01:08:57,008 --> 01:08:59,591
and therefore she dipped her finger
in her own blood.

716
01:08:59,719 --> 01:09:02,711
She wrote "J" on the wall. "Jacqueline"!

717
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:07,387
Oh, what you say is dumb!
The lady dies instantly!

718
01:09:07,518 --> 01:09:08,724
- Really?
- <i>Ja</i>!

719
01:09:08,853 --> 01:09:11,436
There is no time for writing
with the finger in blood.

720
01:09:11,564 --> 01:09:14,352
- No, no.
- Oh, you make a joke?

721
01:09:14,484 --> 01:09:18,227
Well, it's a very small one.
Not in very good taste, I'm afraid.

722
01:09:18,363 --> 01:09:22,732
The fact remains the "J" is on the wall.
Now it's up to us to explain why.

723
01:09:22,867 --> 01:09:27,987
It seems a gesture
which is childishly melodramatic.

724
01:09:28,122 --> 01:09:31,831
- Doctor, what about the time of death?
- Well...

725
01:09:31,959 --> 01:09:36,578
She has been dead at least six hours,
no longer than eight.

726
01:09:36,714 --> 01:09:38,955
That puts it between midnight
and 2 AM.

727
01:09:39,092 --> 01:09:41,333
- Which is extraordinary.
- Why is that?

728
01:09:41,469 --> 01:09:44,461
Because it means quite simply
that <i>Mademoiselle</i> Jacqueline

729
01:09:44,597 --> 01:09:46,304
could not have done it.

730
01:09:46,432 --> 01:09:48,719
<i>You told me yourself,
*mon colonel,</i>

731
01:09:48,851 --> 01:09:53,345
<i>that Madame Doyle left the observation
saloon a little before 11:45,</i>

732
01:09:53,481 --> 01:09:54,812
<i>to go to bed.</i>

733
01:09:54,941 --> 01:09:57,103
<i>And from then on, Jackie was in view</i>

734
01:09:57,235 --> 01:10:00,023
<i>either of Mademoiselle Rosalie
and Monsieur Doyle</i>

735
01:10:00,154 --> 01:10:03,146
<i>or of Monsieur Ferguson
and Mademoiselle Bowers,</i>

736
01:10:03,282 --> 01:10:08,698
<i>who injected her with morphia and
stayed with her in her cabin all night.</i>

737
01:10:09,789 --> 01:10:13,300
And Simon Doyle is also eliminated
by reason of his broken leg.

738
01:10:13,301 --> 01:10:15,487
I don't suppose he could've walked
very far with that wound?

739
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:17,661
Not one step, I assure you.

740
01:10:17,797 --> 01:10:21,461
Excellent! Let's hope the process
of elimination continues as smoothly.

741
01:10:21,592 --> 01:10:23,299
I am afraid it will not, <i>mon colonel</i>.

742
01:10:23,428 --> 01:10:25,044
After all, everyone on this boat knew

743
01:10:25,179 --> 01:10:28,046
exactly why <i>Mademoiselle</i> Jacqueline
hated <i>Madame</i> Doyle.

744
01:10:28,182 --> 01:10:32,551
She was a natural for what
the Americans would call a "frame-up".

745
01:10:32,687 --> 01:10:36,601
At least, <i>mein Herr</i>,
you cannot suspect me!

746
01:10:36,733 --> 01:10:38,223
Oh, why not?

747
01:10:38,359 --> 01:10:41,977
You had a very good reason to kill her,
as I discovered last night.

748
01:10:42,113 --> 01:10:45,276
Oh. Then you did overhear!

749
01:10:45,408 --> 01:10:48,571
But that was no motive.
I mean, I could have sued her.

750
01:10:48,703 --> 01:10:54,665
- And risk ruin? Murder is cheaper.
- And safer, if you don't get caught.

751
01:10:54,792 --> 01:10:57,124
But I could not have done such a thing.

752
01:10:57,253 --> 01:10:58,209
I disagree.

753
01:10:58,337 --> 01:11:01,830
<i>At the time of the shooting
of Monsieur Doyle,</i>

754
01:11:01,966 --> 01:11:05,925
<i>you could have been on deck,
perhaps unable to sleep.</i>

755
01:11:07,013 --> 01:11:10,256
<i>You could have heard
the sound of voices,</i>

756
01:11:10,391 --> 01:11:14,225
<i>looked through the window
of the saloon, seen what happened...</i>

757
01:11:14,353 --> 01:11:16,970
- Go to bed!
- You can't treat me like this!

758
01:11:17,106 --> 01:11:18,517
Now look, Jackie!

759
01:11:18,649 --> 01:11:20,515
I'll kill you first!

760
01:11:20,651 --> 01:11:22,767
Jackie!

761
01:11:26,532 --> 01:11:28,819
<i>And remembered
the position of the gun.</i>

762
01:11:28,951 --> 01:11:32,034
<i>Later, when you were
called from your cabin,</i>

763
01:11:32,163 --> 01:11:37,249
<i>you could have picked up the gun
while you were tending Monsieur Doyle.</i>

764
01:11:37,376 --> 01:11:39,788
<i>Later still, when all was quiet,</i>

765
01:11:39,921 --> 01:11:44,586
<i>you could have left your cabin,
unobserved by your sleeping patient,</i>

766
01:11:44,717 --> 01:11:48,756
<i>and gone to Madame Doyle's cabin
and shot her.</i>

767
01:11:50,848 --> 01:11:53,886
No, <i>Herr</i> Doctor,
I cannot rule you out.

768
01:11:54,018 --> 01:11:57,807
What you are suggesting is *<i>übermässig</i>!

769
01:12:00,566 --> 01:12:02,603
Outrageous! <i>Ja</i>!

770
01:12:02,735 --> 01:12:06,694
No, I will not stay here
to be insulted.

771
01:12:39,689 --> 01:12:42,181
Found something in the nail varnish?

772
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:45,939
*You can't catch flies with vinegar.
<i>On n'attrape pas les mouches avec le vinaigre.</i>

773
01:12:45,945 --> 01:12:46,855
I beg your pardon?

774
01:12:46,988 --> 01:12:51,528
It's an old French proverb,
which takes too long to explain.

775
01:12:51,659 --> 01:12:54,822
Come, my friend. Let us prepare
ourselves for our investigation

776
01:12:54,954 --> 01:12:56,820
of the paying customers.

777
01:13:01,294 --> 01:13:03,581
How long was it, in your estimation,

778
01:13:03,713 --> 01:13:08,958
between the time you and Dr. Bessner
carried <i>Monsieur</i> Doyle from the saloon

779
01:13:09,093 --> 01:13:11,460
to when you returned
to look for the gun?

780
01:13:11,596 --> 01:13:15,965
- Oh, about three or four minutes.
- Three or four minutes.

781
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:19,534
By your own admission, you were just outside
the saloon when the shooting took place.

782
01:13:19,562 --> 01:13:21,929
In other words, it would have been
perfectly possible for you

783
01:13:22,064 --> 01:13:24,021
to have noted the position of the gun.

784
01:13:24,150 --> 01:13:25,982
I agree. Perfectly possible.

785
01:13:26,110 --> 01:13:32,402
Perfectly possible also for you to have
waited until the saloon was empty,

786
01:13:32,533 --> 01:13:37,369
then to have taken the gun
and only pretended not to have found it.

787
01:13:45,546 --> 01:13:48,914
<i>Then, before returning
to Dr. Bessner to report its loss,</i>

788
01:13:49,050 --> 01:13:52,088
<i>you could have used it
to kill Madame Doyle.</i>

789
01:13:52,219 --> 01:13:55,428
I could have done,
but as it happens, I didn't!

790
01:13:56,599 --> 01:13:58,181
And you, <i>Mademoiselle</i>?

791
01:13:58,309 --> 01:14:00,926
You could have taken the gun
before you left here,

792
01:14:01,062 --> 01:14:04,976
<i>when Monsieur Ferguson
was helping Monsieur Doyle.</i>

793
01:14:14,492 --> 01:14:16,733
- I'll get Miss Bowers.
- Yeah, right.

794
01:14:21,832 --> 01:14:24,824
<i>On your way to fetch Miss Bowers,</i>

795
01:14:24,961 --> 01:14:28,795
<i>you could have seized the opportunity
to take the gun to Madame Doyle's cabin</i>

796
01:14:28,923 --> 01:14:30,413
<i>and murder her.</i>

797
01:14:37,832 --> 01:14:41,720
<i>It would have added only a minute
or two to the time that you were away.</i>

798
01:14:41,852 --> 01:14:45,186
Miss Bowers! Wake up! Miss Bowers!

799
01:14:47,241 --> 01:14:50,399
- What's that? - Could you please come
quickly, there's been an accident.

800
01:14:50,427 --> 01:14:53,270
Why should either of us
take the blasted gun?

801
01:14:53,406 --> 01:14:55,397
We have no reason
to murder Linnet Doyle.

802
01:14:55,533 --> 01:14:57,945
Ah, but she was "a leech".

803
01:14:58,077 --> 01:15:00,535
She was "a parasite
on the skin of society"

804
01:15:00,663 --> 01:15:03,781
- who "deserved to be bumped off".
- Well, yes, but...

805
01:15:03,916 --> 01:15:07,659
Oh, yes, <i>Monsieur</i>. "Bumped off
as a warning to the others".

806
01:15:07,795 --> 01:15:09,536
You damned Froggy eavesdropper.

807
01:15:09,672 --> 01:15:14,041
Belgian! Belgian *(h)eavesdropper,
if you please, sir.

808
01:15:14,176 --> 01:15:19,137
And you, <i>Mademoiselle</i>. You were eager
to save your mother great damages.

809
01:15:19,265 --> 01:15:21,427
How could I possibly have done that?

810
01:15:21,559 --> 01:15:24,551
You asked a question two days ago.
I will now answer it for you.

811
01:15:24,687 --> 01:15:29,682
You are quite right, <i>Mademoiselle</i>.
You cannot libel the dead.

812
01:15:30,693 --> 01:15:32,525
I think you're horrid.

813
01:15:32,653 --> 01:15:34,690
You pretend to be
so kind and considerate,

814
01:15:34,822 --> 01:15:36,483
and all you want to do is trap us.

815
01:15:37,783 --> 01:15:42,573
I must find out what lies hidden,
<i>Mademoiselle</i>. The truth.

816
01:15:44,290 --> 01:15:47,783
What it amounts to, then, is after
you gave Miss Jacqueline the morphia,

817
01:15:47,918 --> 01:15:49,829
she never stirred all night.

818
01:15:49,962 --> 01:15:52,750
Exactly. Nervous reaction, booze
and morphia.

819
01:15:52,882 --> 01:15:55,214
Together, they'd have sunk the Titanic.

820
01:15:55,342 --> 01:15:58,175
So, unquestionably,
she could not have done the murder'?

821
01:15:58,304 --> 01:16:00,921
No, absolutely not.

822
01:16:01,057 --> 01:16:05,267
No, but you could have.

823
01:16:06,353 --> 01:16:09,891
- Me?
- Yes, you, <i>Mademoiselle</i>.

824
01:16:10,024 --> 01:16:13,062
Let us suppose you were out on deck
at the time of the shooting

825
01:16:13,194 --> 01:16:17,904
and saw what took place, and thus knew
where the gun was lying.

826
01:16:18,032 --> 01:16:21,570
Young lady, you come with me, <i>ja</i>?

827
01:16:21,702 --> 01:16:24,160
You'll be more help
than this *<i>Stutzer</i> here

828
01:16:24,288 --> 01:16:27,906
who's scared at the sight
of a little blood.

829
01:16:28,042 --> 01:16:31,034
<i>While Monsieur Ferguson
and Mademoiselle Rosalie</i>

830
01:16:31,170 --> 01:16:33,207
<i>were assisting Dr. Bessner,</i>

831
01:16:33,339 --> 01:16:37,958
<i>you could have left your unconscious patient
and run in here to pick up the gun.</i>

832
01:16:38,094 --> 01:16:39,584
<i>You would have had enough time</i>

833
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:43,429
<i>before Monsieur Ferguson returned
to search for it.</i>

834
01:16:57,655 --> 01:17:01,444
<i>Then you could have hurried down
the port side to Madame Doyle's cabin</i>

835
01:17:01,575 --> 01:17:02,906
<i>and shot her.</i>

836
01:17:03,869 --> 01:17:08,033
Preposterous!
Why should I kill Mrs. Doyle?

837
01:17:08,165 --> 01:17:10,827
Because her father was
Melhuish Ridgeway,

838
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:14,453
whose unscrupulous business methods
ruined your father

839
01:17:14,588 --> 01:17:17,250
and condemned you to a servant's life.

840
01:17:17,383 --> 01:17:20,125
Poppycock. From whom did you hear that?

841
01:17:20,261 --> 01:17:22,844
From your own lips, <i>Mademoiselle</i>,
three days ago.

842
01:17:22,972 --> 01:17:25,805
How dare you listen
to a private conversation!

843
01:17:25,933 --> 01:17:27,924
Some voices carry.

844
01:17:29,478 --> 01:17:30,593
Is it true?

845
01:17:34,275 --> 01:17:36,858
- Yes, it is.
<i>- Voila.</i>

846
01:17:36,986 --> 01:17:41,105
But why should I kill Mrs. Doyle
for something that happened years ago?

847
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:46,280
Because its effects are still
deeply resented by you to this day.

848
01:17:46,412 --> 01:17:48,619
No, unfortunately, <i>Mademoiselle</i>,

849
01:17:48,747 --> 01:17:51,489
I cannot be persuaded
by your protestations.

850
01:17:51,625 --> 01:17:54,663
To my mind, you had the means,
the motive, the opportunity,

851
01:17:54,795 --> 01:17:58,333
and what is more,
the disposition to kill.

852
01:17:58,465 --> 01:18:00,581
Have you quite finished,
<i>Monsieur</i> Poirot?

853
01:18:00,618 --> 01:18:03,128
For the time being.
But you will hold yourself ready

854
01:18:03,160 --> 01:18:05,298
to answer further questions
should the need arise.

855
01:18:05,431 --> 01:18:08,924
- I shall do no such thing.
- <i>Monsieur</i> Poirot!

856
01:18:11,312 --> 01:18:16,057
- It is true about Linnet?
- It is perfectly true.

857
01:18:22,489 --> 01:18:25,902
I didn't kill her. I know
you all think I did, but I didn't.

858
01:18:26,035 --> 01:18:27,742
<i>*Calmez vous, calmez vous, ma petite.</i>

859
01:18:27,870 --> 01:18:30,783
We know that you did not kill
<i>Madame</i> Doyle. We have proved it.

860
01:18:30,915 --> 01:18:32,371
- Proved!
- Thank God.

861
01:18:33,792 --> 01:18:35,533
What about Simon? Is he alright?

862
01:18:35,669 --> 01:18:39,708
Dr. Bessner seems reasonably satisfied
with his condition, so far.

863
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:48,714
I was mad last night.
I might have killed him.

864
01:18:48,849 --> 01:18:52,558
- Do you think he'll ever forgive me?
- It's more than likely.

865
01:18:52,686 --> 01:18:54,097
It's been my experience

866
01:18:54,230 --> 01:18:57,973
that men are least attracted
to women who treat them well.

867
01:18:58,108 --> 01:19:02,897
Miss Bowers, will you please escort Miss Jacqueline
to her cabin and see that she's alright.

868
01:19:03,822 --> 01:19:06,314
We'll arrange a visit
to <i>Monsieur</i> Doyle later on.

869
01:19:06,450 --> 01:19:08,157
Oh, thank you.

870
01:19:22,383 --> 01:19:26,217
I think you and I should visit him first.
He must be awake by now.

871
01:19:28,497 --> 01:19:30,728
*<i>Bonne idée.</i> (Good idea)

872
01:19:33,978 --> 01:19:35,434
The thing which intrig...

873
01:19:36,855 --> 01:19:39,392
...intrigues me most about
this case is the pistol.

874
01:19:39,525 --> 01:19:41,357
- The pistol?
- Why is it missing?

875
01:19:41,485 --> 01:19:43,146
I fail to see why that is important.

876
01:19:43,279 --> 01:19:45,361
In many cases
the murder weapon is missing.

877
01:19:45,489 --> 01:19:48,777
Even in a case
where a frame-up is attempted? No.

878
01:19:48,909 --> 01:19:53,699
Why did the murderer go to the lengths
of writing "J" on the wall in blood,

879
01:19:53,831 --> 01:19:55,492
and then removing J's gun?

880
01:19:55,624 --> 01:19:58,082
Yes, I see what you mean.
Oh, they found something.

881
01:19:59,837 --> 01:20:04,047
One thing is for certain.
<i>Madame</i> Doyle was not killed by a fish.

882
01:20:39,877 --> 01:20:43,541
- Are you alright?
- Yes, thank you.

883
01:20:43,672 --> 01:20:45,834
I must have just blacked out
for a moment.

884
01:20:45,966 --> 01:20:48,583
Try a spot of lunch.
It might give you some strength.

885
01:20:48,719 --> 01:20:51,837
- No, thank you. I couldn't face it.
- You couldn't face it?

886
01:20:51,972 --> 01:20:55,135
- Do you permit that, er...
- Please, do. Help yourself.

887
01:21:05,611 --> 01:21:07,602
I just can't believe that...

888
01:21:09,948 --> 01:21:11,063
...that Linnet's dead.

889
01:21:12,701 --> 01:21:14,533
It's a bad knock.

890
01:21:16,497 --> 01:21:19,285
I suppose it must look awfully black
against Jackie,

891
01:21:19,416 --> 01:21:22,499
but I just know she wouldn't
commit cold-blooded murder.

892
01:21:22,628 --> 01:21:24,539
No, rest assured, <i>Monsieur</i>,

893
01:21:24,671 --> 01:21:27,379
we know for a fact it was
not <i>Mademoiselle</i> Jackie.

894
01:21:27,508 --> 01:21:28,714
Thank God for that.

895
01:21:29,718 --> 01:21:32,551
Well, then, do you have any idea
who it might have been?

896
01:21:33,555 --> 01:21:36,593
Well, it could have been
practically anybody.

897
01:21:36,725 --> 01:21:39,843
Well, only yesterday
she was saying

898
01:21:39,978 --> 01:21:42,185
everybody around her on this boat
was her enemy.

899
01:21:42,314 --> 01:21:46,148
We have reason to believe
that she was right, <i>Monsieur</i>.

900
01:21:51,657 --> 01:21:52,897
<i>Monsieur</i>...

901
01:21:53,909 --> 01:21:55,240
<i>Oh, pardon.</i>

902
01:21:56,245 --> 01:21:58,031
I came to see if you were comfortable.

903
01:21:58,163 --> 01:22:00,871
As comfortable as can be expected.
Thank you, Louise.

904
01:22:00,999 --> 01:22:02,615
Ah, the discoverer of the body!

905
01:22:02,751 --> 01:22:05,083
You should be able to shed
some light on all this.

906
01:22:05,212 --> 01:22:07,169
<i>Pardon?</i>

907
01:22:07,297 --> 01:22:11,291
You, you, you accuse me?
A respectable girl?

908
01:22:11,427 --> 01:22:14,999
- I swear to you on my mother's grave...
- *<i>Allons, allons, Louise</i>. (Come, come)

909
01:22:15,055 --> 01:22:18,639
Don't fuss so, just tell the truth
*<i>Pas tant d'histoires, faut dire la vérité.</i>

910
01:22:18,767 --> 01:22:20,257
*<i>Asseyez-vous.</i> (Sit)

911
01:22:23,129 --> 01:22:26,331
you can't suspect me
<i>Monsieur le detective, il faut pas se douter de moi.</i>

912
01:22:26,332 --> 01:22:30,333
Poor Mrs. Doyle. Everyone loved her
<i>Cette pauvre Madame Doyle. Tout le monde l'aimait.</i>

913
01:22:30,334 --> 01:22:32,236
So young, so beautiful.
<i>Elle était si jeune, si belle.</i>

914
01:22:32,244 --> 01:22:34,536
No one would want to kill her.
<i>Il y a personne qui aurait voulu la tuer.</i>

915
01:22:34,538 --> 01:22:37,157
Louise, don't joke. I'll...
<i>Louise, pas de blagues. Je vous...</i>

916
01:22:37,161 --> 01:22:40,904
Poirot, can we please keep this in some
language which we can all understand?

917
01:22:41,039 --> 01:22:45,078
She said that all the world
loved <i>Madame</i> Doyle.

918
01:22:45,210 --> 01:22:47,042
At least that's a fresh approach.

919
01:22:47,171 --> 01:22:52,007
Now then, when did you last see
Mrs. Doyle alive?

920
01:22:52,134 --> 01:22:56,219
Last night, <i>Monsieur</i>. I was in her cabin
to undress her and put her to bed.

921
01:22:56,346 --> 01:23:00,635
- And then where did you go?
- To my cabin. Where else?

922
01:23:00,767 --> 01:23:04,055
And you didn't see or hear anything
after that that might help us?

923
01:23:04,188 --> 01:23:07,806
How could I, <i>Monsieur</i>? My cabin
was on the other side of the boat.

924
01:23:08,859 --> 01:23:14,980
Naturally, if I'd been unable to sleep,
if I'd stayed on deck then,

925
01:23:15,115 --> 01:23:19,404
perhaps I would have seen this assassin
enter and leave <i>Madame</i>'s cabin.

926
01:23:20,621 --> 01:23:22,032
But as it <i>is...</i>

927
01:23:22,164 --> 01:23:24,952
Oh, <i>Monsieur</i>, I implore you.
You see how it is.

928
01:23:25,083 --> 01:23:28,872
- What else can I say?
- Nobody's accusing you of anything.

929
01:23:29,004 --> 01:23:31,291
New, don't worry, Louise.
I'll look after you.

930
01:23:31,423 --> 01:23:33,539
- <i>Monsieur</i> is very good.
- But...

931
01:23:35,969 --> 01:23:40,805
If you had not gone straight back to
your cabin after leaving <i>Madame</i> Doyle,

932
01:23:40,933 --> 01:23:42,594
you would have had time

933
01:23:42,726 --> 01:23:45,468
to witness the shooting
of <i>Monsieur</i> Doyle in the saloon.

934
01:23:45,604 --> 01:23:48,016
<i>- Ah, non!
- Ah, *oui!</i>

935
01:23:48,148 --> 01:23:51,607
You could have walked on the deck,
seen everything.

936
01:23:51,735 --> 01:23:55,399
Then when the coast was clear,
you could have taken the gun...

937
01:23:55,531 --> 01:23:56,862
<i>.. Returned...</i>

938
01:24:01,161 --> 01:24:02,822
<i>..and shot Madame Doyle.</i>

939
01:24:02,955 --> 01:24:05,117
<i>Monsieur</i>, you accuse me unjustly.

940
01:24:05,249 --> 01:24:07,911
Why should I do such a wicked thing?
Just answer me that.

941
01:24:08,043 --> 01:24:10,000
Oh, Louise.

942
01:24:10,128 --> 01:24:14,122
I know all about you,
and your love affair,

943
01:24:14,258 --> 01:24:17,922
and <i>Madame</i> Doyle's objections
to your leaving her.

944
01:24:18,053 --> 01:24:22,513
But I had no money and no references.
I had no choice but to stay.

945
01:24:22,641 --> 01:24:25,053
<i>*Précisément.</i>
And how you hated her for that.

946
01:24:25,185 --> 01:24:26,675
But I didn't kill her!

947
01:24:27,646 --> 01:24:32,857
One final question, Louise.
Where are <i>Madame</i> Doyle's pearls?

948
01:24:34,319 --> 01:24:38,904
Her pearls?
She was wearing them last night.

949
01:24:39,032 --> 01:24:40,818
She put them on the table by her bed.

950
01:24:40,951 --> 01:24:46,993
- And were they there this morning?
- <i>*Mon Dieu</i>! I didn't even look!

951
01:24:47,124 --> 01:24:53,621
I went to her bed, I saw <i>Madame</i>,
I cried out, and I ran out of the room.

952
01:24:53,755 --> 01:24:55,462
You did not even look!

953
01:24:56,550 --> 01:25:00,339
But I, Hercule Poirot,
have eyes which notice everything.

954
01:25:01,305 --> 01:25:04,843
The pearls were not on
the dressing table this morning.

955
01:25:04,975 --> 01:25:08,388
They had gone. Vanished.

956
01:25:09,896 --> 01:25:11,386
<i>*Disparues.</i>

957
01:25:25,829 --> 01:25:28,321
- We must find the gun.
- And the pearls.

958
01:25:28,457 --> 01:25:31,324
Yes, that should not prove
too difficult.

959
01:25:31,460 --> 01:25:34,794
<i>Oh là là, q'il fait *chaud!</i>

960
01:25:34,921 --> 01:25:37,504
It's hot. You're right.
Yes, I could do with a change of shirt.

961
01:25:37,633 --> 01:25:40,295
Yes, let's *make a little pause
to freshen <i>la *toilette</i>.

962
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:47,090
- And to rest the little grey cells.
- I'll see you in five minutes.

963
01:26:17,964 --> 01:26:19,170
<i>Oh, lá, lá!</i>

964
01:27:35,542 --> 01:27:39,501
I must thank you
for a most timely deliverance.

965
01:27:40,797 --> 01:27:44,381
My pleasure. I heard your SOS. Do you
think it was put there deliberately?

966
01:27:44,509 --> 01:27:45,965
Of course it was.

967
01:27:46,094 --> 01:27:48,131
But it will take more than a serpent

968
01:27:48,263 --> 01:27:52,222
to interrupt the investigation
of Hercule Poirot.

969
01:27:53,477 --> 01:27:57,391
How is the sleuthing going?
With eminence and discretion?

970
01:27:58,607 --> 01:28:01,599
- No one to put the hand *grips on?
- Not yet.

971
01:28:03,278 --> 01:28:04,894
Oh, er...

972
01:28:05,030 --> 01:28:08,989
There is a dead cobra over there.

973
01:28:09,117 --> 01:28:12,451
Do me the kindness of having it removed,
please. Thank you very much.

974
01:28:12,579 --> 01:28:16,573
- Come, Race.
- A cobra? Oh, *cripes!

975
01:28:16,708 --> 01:28:22,203
Never have I seen such a reptile
in a first class cabin. Never.

976
01:28:32,098 --> 01:28:34,510
Who's next? Pennington?
We know he's a *wrong 'un.

977
01:28:34,643 --> 01:28:36,805
Oh, he's a dangerous one.

978
01:28:59,626 --> 01:29:02,163
<i>Monsieur</i> Poirot, I presume?

979
01:29:03,213 --> 01:29:05,545
<i>Excusez *nous, Madame</i>.

980
01:29:09,386 --> 01:29:12,595
Perhaps you will permit us to join you?

981
01:29:12,722 --> 01:29:13,928
Of course.

982
01:29:17,143 --> 01:29:18,008
Well?

983
01:29:18,144 --> 01:29:20,602
Your cabin is next to <i>Madame</i> Doyle's,
<i>*n'est-ce pas?</i>

984
01:29:20,730 --> 01:29:21,686
It is.

985
01:29:21,815 --> 01:29:24,898
Did you hear anything strange
late last night?

986
01:29:25,026 --> 01:29:28,439
I certainly did.
I am a very light sleeper.

987
01:29:28,572 --> 01:29:31,485
I was awakened by a popping sound.

988
01:29:31,616 --> 01:29:33,198
A Popping sound?

989
01:29:33,326 --> 01:29:37,570
Exactly. Just like a champagne cork
coming out of a bottle.

990
01:29:38,665 --> 01:29:41,407
An indifferent champagne,
you understand?

991
01:29:41,543 --> 01:29:46,754
Not a great vintage.
That makes a much more discreet sound.

992
01:29:46,882 --> 01:29:50,671
Could it have been a small pistol
instead of an old champagne cork?

993
01:29:50,802 --> 01:29:51,712
Very possibly.

994
01:29:51,845 --> 01:29:54,132
Though I'm sure you must appreciate

995
01:29:54,264 --> 01:29:58,428
that I have a minimal familiarity
with firearms.

996
01:30:06,151 --> 01:30:10,486
We have found it! We have found it!
Oh, goody, goody!

997
01:30:10,614 --> 01:30:11,979
Oh. Goody, goody *gumdrops!

998
01:30:15,076 --> 01:30:21,118
This certainly takes the camel's *hump.
Oh, yes, and no mistake! Gentlemen!

999
01:30:23,376 --> 01:30:27,290
Gentlemen, I'm sure we have
found what you're looking for.

1000
01:30:27,422 --> 01:30:29,538
- Thank you, Mr. Choudry.
- No mention.

1001
01:30:37,849 --> 01:30:41,683
Ah, without question,
the pistol of <i>Mademoiselle</i> Jackie.

1002
01:30:45,315 --> 01:30:48,524
New Derringer .22, four shot.

1003
01:30:48,652 --> 01:30:50,188
Two bullets fired.

1004
01:30:51,529 --> 01:30:53,736
A man's handkerchief. Looks like blood.

1005
01:30:53,865 --> 01:30:57,278
And a marble ashtray
to send it to the bottom.

1006
01:30:57,410 --> 01:31:00,653
- And MY stole.
- This is yours, Madam?

1007
01:31:00,789 --> 01:31:04,327
Well, of course it's mine.
I missed it last night in the saloon.

1008
01:31:05,160 --> 01:31:09,203
Look, the murderer must've wrapped it around
the pistol, to deaden the noise of the shots.

1009
01:31:09,339 --> 01:31:12,377
Impertinence! That stole was
given to me in Romania

1010
01:31:12,509 --> 01:31:15,001
by Crown Prince Carol himself.

1011
01:31:15,136 --> 01:31:18,970
People are no respecters
of other people's property.

1012
01:31:19,099 --> 01:31:22,012
Nor indeed of other people's jewellery.

1013
01:31:23,645 --> 01:31:26,103
What can you be referring to, <i>Monsieur</i>?

1014
01:31:26,231 --> 01:31:28,973
I'm referring to the Potsdam pearls,
<i>Madame</i>!

1015
01:31:29,109 --> 01:31:32,227
Which belong to <i>Madame</i> Doyle
and which have been abducted!

1016
01:31:33,405 --> 01:31:37,820
- Abducted?
- <i>*Dérobé.</i> Purloined.

1017
01:31:38,827 --> 01:31:40,363
Pinched.

1018
01:31:40,495 --> 01:31:46,662
And why are you looking at me
in that too-familiar, continental way?

1019
01:31:46,793 --> 01:31:49,000
What have these pearls to do with me?

1020
01:31:49,129 --> 01:31:55,045
Ah, I am the nasty
little *(h)eavesdropper, <i>Madame</i>.

1021
01:31:55,176 --> 01:31:57,213
I heard that you much admire
these pearls.

1022
01:31:57,345 --> 01:32:01,430
That you would give "every tooth
in your head to possess them".

1023
01:32:01,558 --> 01:32:04,016
That bloody Bowers!

1024
01:32:04,144 --> 01:32:08,183
It is my theory that you have
an obsessive love of jewellery, <i>Madame</i>.

1025
01:32:08,314 --> 01:32:11,102
that you coveted <i>Madame</i>
Doyle's pearls

1026
01:32:11,234 --> 01:32:17,776
and that you determined to possess them,
even if this meant robbery or murder.

1027
01:32:19,034 --> 01:32:21,366
You do not deny it, <i>Madame</i>?

1028
01:32:21,494 --> 01:32:24,612
I can picture you walking the deck
last night,

1029
01:32:24,748 --> 01:32:27,911
<i>waiting for Madame Doyle to be asleep.</i>

1030
01:32:28,043 --> 01:32:29,033
<i>Go to bed!</i>

1031
01:32:29,169 --> 01:32:31,661
<i>Quite by chance,
you see the shooting in the saloon.</i>

1032
01:32:31,796 --> 01:32:33,707
- Look, Jackie!
- I'll kill you first!

1033
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:35,922
Jackie!

1034
01:32:37,010 --> 01:32:40,719
<i>When the room is empty, you seize
the opportunity of taking the gun.</i>

1035
01:32:40,847 --> 01:32:45,216
<i>You go to Madame Doyle's cabin,
knowing that her husband will not be there.</i>

1036
01:32:53,818 --> 01:33:00,030
<i>You shoot her and then you take
the pearls from her bedside table.</i>

1037
01:33:00,158 --> 01:33:01,819
You will withdraw that!

1038
01:33:01,951 --> 01:33:06,195
Or I shall prosecute you for slander
with the utmost vigour!

1039
01:33:06,331 --> 01:33:11,041
It will not equal the vigour
with which I shall search this boat,

1040
01:33:11,169 --> 01:33:14,287
and in particular, your cabin,
<i>Madame</i>, for those pearls.

1041
01:33:14,422 --> 01:33:15,787
I give you a good afternoon.

1042
01:33:15,924 --> 01:33:22,136
- You perfectly foul French upstart!
- Belgian upstart, please, <i>Madame</i>.

1043
01:33:25,892 --> 01:33:28,133
Was it necessary to be
so rough on the old lady?

1044
01:33:28,139 --> 01:33:30,221
I mean really, you seem to be
accusing everybody.

1045
01:33:30,230 --> 01:33:33,994
With reason, <i>mon colonel</i>. What, you
think old ladies don't commit murder?

1046
01:33:34,025 --> 01:33:35,641
I am convinced she has the pearls.

1047
01:33:35,777 --> 01:33:38,735
The only question is,
did she kill to acquire them?

1048
01:33:38,863 --> 01:33:41,275
- <i>Monsieur</i> Choudry!
- <i>Marhaban!</i> (hello)

1049
01:33:42,700 --> 01:33:44,907
- Yes, Colonel?
- We will depart immediately.

1050
01:33:45,036 --> 01:33:46,572
I've already given the orders.

1051
01:33:46,704 --> 01:33:49,571
At this very moment,
the engineer is building up steam.

1052
01:33:51,918 --> 01:33:52,874
Why the sudden rush?

1053
01:33:53,002 --> 01:33:56,461
I tell you, <i>mon *vieu</i> (old man), I feel
the presence of evil all about me.

1054
01:33:56,589 --> 01:33:58,921
The sooner we reach Wadi Halfa,
the better.

1055
01:33:59,050 --> 01:34:00,916
I'll lock these up in a safe place.

1056
01:34:01,052 --> 01:34:03,760
Then we must commence our search
for the pearls.

1057
01:34:15,316 --> 01:34:19,105
That's the last of the crew's cabins.
Maybe she threw them overboard.

1058
01:34:20,405 --> 01:34:23,488
You forget that we have not yet
examined Pennington's cabin.

1059
01:34:23,616 --> 01:34:25,027
That's right. Let's do it now.

1060
01:34:25,160 --> 01:34:29,575
*Ahoy there!
So our journey is continuing.

1061
01:34:29,706 --> 01:34:31,413
Good afternoon, <i>Madame</i>.

1062
01:34:32,834 --> 01:34:35,075
Will you not join me
for a little refreshment?

1063
01:34:35,211 --> 01:34:36,827
This marvellous little man here

1064
01:34:36,963 --> 01:34:39,546
has just made me
the most extraordinary concoction

1065
01:34:39,674 --> 01:34:41,540
out of native fruit juices.

1066
01:34:41,676 --> 01:34:43,383
It's called a Golden Sobek,

1067
01:34:43,511 --> 01:34:47,470
and is named after the god of
the ancient city of Crocodilopolis.

1068
01:34:47,599 --> 01:34:49,260
Not for me, thank you very much.

1069
01:34:49,392 --> 01:34:53,135
Sometimes I do take the *hair of the dog,
but never the scale of the crocodile.

1070
01:34:53,271 --> 01:34:54,306
Race!

1071
01:34:54,439 --> 01:34:57,181
And how are you getting along
with your investigation

1072
01:34:57,317 --> 01:34:59,399
of this tragic affair,
<i>Monsieur</i> Porridge?

1073
01:34:59,527 --> 01:35:02,895
<i>Ah, normalment, Madame</i>.
Normally, as they say.

1074
01:35:03,031 --> 01:35:07,616
Oh, the <i>*crime passionnel</i>,
the primitive instinct to kill,

1075
01:35:07,744 --> 01:35:10,202
so closely allied to the sex instinct.

1076
01:35:11,414 --> 01:35:14,497
I have every sympathy
for that poor, half-crazed Jackie.

1077
01:35:14,626 --> 01:35:19,416
Her emotions are a turmoil,
her hot Latin blood raging

1078
01:35:19,547 --> 01:35:21,788
to be avenged on the woman
who stole her man.

1079
01:35:21,925 --> 01:35:24,917
Yes, of course, but it could
have been someone else,

1080
01:35:25,053 --> 01:35:27,511
with a motive at least as good.

1081
01:35:28,806 --> 01:35:32,424
- Oh, who?
- You, <i>Madame</i> Otterbourne.

1082
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:35,097
- What are you talking about?
- Oh, come, come.

1083
01:35:35,100 --> 01:35:37,867
Both your daughter and you know
that you cannot libel the dead.

1084
01:35:37,899 --> 01:35:42,018
Now you will never have to pay
those huge damages she was asking for.

1085
01:35:42,153 --> 01:35:44,941
- Yes, but one would hardly kill for that.
- Would one not?

1086
01:35:46,532 --> 01:35:49,064
- Well?
- I'll have another Golden What-Have-You.

1087
01:35:51,871 --> 01:35:53,782
You know, Mrs. Otterbourne...

1088
01:35:54,999 --> 01:35:59,493
It is you that I can see looking
into the saloon through the windows

1089
01:35:59,629 --> 01:36:01,540
at that, as you put it,

1090
01:36:01,673 --> 01:36:05,837
poor, half-crazed Jacqueline
shooting <i>Monsieur</i> Doyle.

1091
01:36:05,969 --> 01:36:10,964
<i>And then, when everyone has gone,
running in to take up the gun,</i>

1092
01:36:11,099 --> 01:36:14,433
<i>and then stealing forth
to kill Madame Doyle.</i>

1093
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:18,849
No! My world is the world of grand love
and passionate romance,

1094
01:36:18,982 --> 01:36:20,518
not grubby murders.

1095
01:36:20,650 --> 01:36:22,482
Now, if you'll please leave me alone.

1096
01:36:22,610 --> 01:36:25,568
Well, if we have disturbed you,
we are both *desolate.

1097
01:36:25,697 --> 01:36:27,062
Life can be so cruel!

1098
01:36:27,198 --> 01:36:30,987
You must be brave, very brave,
to bear the calumnies of life.

1099
01:36:33,955 --> 01:36:38,540
Here, barman!
This crocodile has lost its "croc"!

1100
01:36:49,945 --> 03:13:35,149
What a perfectly dreadful woman.
Why doesn't somebody shoot her, I wonder?

1101
01:36:45,233 --> 01:36:48,246
Well perhaps one day, the subscribers
of the lending libraries

1102
01:36:48,277 --> 01:36:51,010
will club together and hire an assassin.

1103
01:37:19,083 --> 01:37:21,165
So, <i>Madame</i> Van Schuyler
is foolish enough

1104
01:37:21,294 --> 01:37:24,036
to play games with Hercule Poirot.

1105
01:37:24,172 --> 01:37:27,540
You realise, of course, you have
no actual proof that she stole them.

1106
01:37:27,675 --> 01:37:31,009
The fact that the pearls have been
returned does not mean for a moment

1107
01:37:31,137 --> 01:37:34,801
that she did not kill
while stealing them in the first place.

1108
01:37:55,203 --> 01:37:56,659
Pennington?

1109
01:38:04,128 --> 01:38:09,874
We must find that document he was
trying to induce <i>Madame</i> Doyle to sign.

1110
01:38:10,009 --> 01:38:11,340
What's this?

1111
01:38:11,469 --> 01:38:13,631
- Poirot.
- Yeah?

1112
01:38:13,763 --> 01:38:16,721
Ho! Well, that proves that <i>Mademoiselle</i>
Jackie was not the only passenger

1113
01:38:16,849 --> 01:38:19,762
- who was travelling armed.
- Still, Linnet Doyle was not shot

1114
01:38:19,894 --> 01:38:22,261
- with a thing this size.
- No, obviously not.

1115
01:38:23,815 --> 01:38:26,933
<i>Oh là-là, là-là là-là!
Quelle *pagaille!</i> (What a mess!)

1116
01:38:30,655 --> 01:38:33,568
Oh, oh, oh!
Your eyes are better. Tell me.

1117
01:38:38,079 --> 01:38:39,285
What the hell is going on?

1118
01:38:39,414 --> 01:38:42,998
We're going through your private
papers, sir, isn't that obvious?

1119
01:38:43,126 --> 01:38:44,582
You're what?

1120
01:38:45,670 --> 01:38:48,537
It may be the custom in Paris
to go through people's things,

1121
01:38:48,673 --> 01:38:49,913
but we're not in Paris now!

1122
01:38:50,049 --> 01:38:53,542
- Brussels, sir! The country is...
- I don't care if it's Borneo!

1123
01:38:53,678 --> 01:38:56,670
You have no right to be in my cabin,
no right at all!

1124
01:38:56,806 --> 01:38:59,857
We have every right.
Pending the arrival of the Police,

1125
01:38:59,859 --> 01:39:02,784
The Company has commissioned us
to investigate this murder.

1126
01:39:02,812 --> 01:39:05,349
Which has nothing to do with my papers!

1127
01:39:05,481 --> 01:39:06,516
On the contrary.

1128
01:39:06,649 --> 01:39:09,266
They prove that
in spite of <i>Madame</i> Doyle's marriage,

1129
01:39:09,402 --> 01:39:12,144
you are still trying
to control her money.

1130
01:39:13,573 --> 01:39:16,486
So what? There's no law against it.

1131
01:39:16,617 --> 01:39:18,858
There is a law against
swindling your client,

1132
01:39:18,995 --> 01:39:21,783
and my people don't like
to see it contravened.

1133
01:39:21,914 --> 01:39:23,655
Your people? Who the hell are they?

1134
01:39:23,791 --> 01:39:27,300
I represent Mrs. Doyle's English lawyers.
And quite frankly, we're not at all happy

1135
01:39:27,328 --> 01:39:30,541
about the way you and your partner
have been handling her affairs.

1136
01:39:30,673 --> 01:39:32,084
- Go to hell.
- Now look here...

1137
01:39:32,216 --> 01:39:35,425
- Her affairs are in perfect order.
- Oh, I wish that were true.

1138
01:39:35,553 --> 01:39:37,004
You see, I think you came over here

1139
01:39:37,013 --> 01:39:39,721
in order to get her signature
on this power of attorney.

1140
01:39:39,849 --> 01:39:44,218
You failed and so you went
to the Temple of Amun...

1141
01:39:45,396 --> 01:39:48,479
<i>..and you climbed
to the top of the tall pillar.</i>

1142
01:40:01,204 --> 01:40:06,916
<i>There, you dislodged a stone which fell
and which narrowly avoided killing her.</i>

1143
01:40:14,091 --> 01:40:17,980
You can't pin that on me. Now, get out of
here! I've heard enough of this garbage.

1144
01:40:18,012 --> 01:40:21,095
You may have to, one day,
listen to a little more of such garbage

1145
01:40:21,224 --> 01:40:24,182
from the lips of a public prosecutor.

1146
01:40:24,310 --> 01:40:27,769
Oh, this is yours, I believe.
Belgium.

1147
01:40:36,739 --> 01:40:41,404
Let us change for dinner.
<i>J'ai *faim.</i> (I'm hungry)

1148
01:40:41,536 --> 01:40:44,198
- Poirot, you have a woman?
- <i>*Femme</i> is woman.

1149
01:40:44,330 --> 01:40:46,412
<i>J'ai *faim.</i> I am peckish.

1150
01:40:49,210 --> 01:40:51,497
Oh, I must have a word
with that little one.

1151
01:40:51,629 --> 01:40:53,996
I will join you at the table,
<i>mon colonel</i>.

1152
01:40:54,131 --> 01:40:56,748
Be good enough to order me
<i>les *morilles</i>. (morel mushroom)

1153
01:40:56,884 --> 01:40:59,751
<i>Les morilles</i>? Oh, moray.(eel)

1154
01:41:06,352 --> 01:41:08,810
Well, how goes it with you,
<i>ma *petite</i>?

1155
01:41:09,855 --> 01:41:11,721
Badly, <i>Monsieur</i> Poirot.

1156
01:41:12,733 --> 01:41:15,100
I feel so ashamed.

1157
01:41:15,236 --> 01:41:18,570
- His wife's dead, and...
- Now he's available to you again.

1158
01:41:21,867 --> 01:41:24,780
Is it so wrong of me to hope
he'll come back?

1159
01:41:24,912 --> 01:41:28,871
I still love him.
And now he needs me more than ever.

1160
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,116
Oh, <i>Monsieur</i> Poirot, could I...?

1161
01:41:31,252 --> 01:41:35,246
Could you arrange for me to see him?
Just for five minutes. Please!

1162
01:41:36,507 --> 01:41:37,963
I don't see why not.

1163
01:41:38,092 --> 01:41:42,711
That is, if he wishes,
and the <i>Herr</i> Doctor raises no objection.

1164
01:41:42,847 --> 01:41:44,713
I will make some inquiries.

1165
01:41:49,520 --> 01:41:53,388
<i>Ah, *gut!</i> The temperature is down!

1166
01:41:53,524 --> 01:41:58,143
Alright, <i>Herr</i> Poirot. I've no objection,
provided the visit is short.

1167
01:41:58,279 --> 01:42:00,987
- <i>*Fünf Minuten</i> at the most, <i>ja</i>?
- <i>Merci, docteur.</i>

1168
01:42:02,033 --> 01:42:03,740
<i>Mademoiselle</i> Jackie!

1169
01:42:04,785 --> 01:42:08,244
- You can see him now.
- Oh, thank you!

1170
01:42:11,375 --> 01:42:12,865
- Hello, Jackie.
- Simon.

1171
01:42:17,632 --> 01:42:20,090
I'm very sorry about Linnet.

1172
01:42:21,302 --> 01:42:23,589
- Thank you.
- Simon, I didn't kill her.

1173
01:42:23,721 --> 01:42:26,383
- I swear that.
- You don't have to say it.

1174
01:42:27,433 --> 01:42:28,764
I know.

1175
01:42:32,271 --> 01:42:35,855
- Forgive me. Please.
- Jackie...

1176
01:42:37,276 --> 01:42:40,439
Last night I was mad.
I might have killed you.

1177
01:42:41,447 --> 01:42:43,939
What, with a rotten little peashooter
like that?

1178
01:42:44,992 --> 01:42:47,859
Will they be able...
Will you walk again?

1179
01:42:47,995 --> 01:42:49,281
Don't be a chump.

1180
01:42:49,413 --> 01:42:51,154
As soon as we get to Wadi Halfa

1181
01:42:51,290 --> 01:42:54,123
they'll dig the damn thing out
and I'll be as right as rain.

1182
01:42:54,251 --> 01:42:57,619
Ah, <i>ja</i>! Yeah!

1183
01:42:57,755 --> 01:43:00,622
Remember, <i>fünf Minuten, ja?</i>

1184
01:43:01,967 --> 01:43:04,459
Oh, Simon, I'm so dreadfully sorry!

1185
01:43:04,595 --> 01:43:08,213
There now.
There's nothing to apologise for.

1186
01:43:28,077 --> 01:43:30,068
<i>*Qu'est-ce que c'est que ça?</i>
(What's this?)

1187
01:43:31,622 --> 01:43:33,613
I asked for a plate of <i>morilles.</i>

1188
01:43:33,749 --> 01:43:36,457
- What's that, when it's at home?
- Mushrooms.

1189
01:43:36,585 --> 01:43:38,121
Oh, I'm sorry.

1190
01:43:38,254 --> 01:43:41,963
I thought you wanted a moray eel.
That's the best they could do.

1191
01:43:42,091 --> 01:43:44,708
- I've ordered you a new bottle of wine.
- Why?

1192
01:43:44,844 --> 01:43:47,802
Because the remains of last night's bottle
was a little mouldy when he poured it out.

1193
01:43:47,930 --> 01:43:48,761
Mouldy?

1194
01:43:48,889 --> 01:43:50,755
Yes, you know,
it had a lot of bits in it.

1195
01:43:50,891 --> 01:43:55,476
But that's the normal sediment
for a great bottle of Château Pétrus.

1196
01:43:58,858 --> 01:44:00,724
- Will you join me in some?
- No, thanks.

1197
01:44:00,860 --> 01:44:03,147
You stick to your wine.
I'll stick to my whisky.

1198
01:44:03,279 --> 01:44:06,397
You drink whisky all the... Wine...

1199
01:44:07,700 --> 01:44:11,284
Oh, how strange... Of course!

1200
01:44:18,043 --> 01:44:20,284
May I?

1201
01:44:20,421 --> 01:44:23,789
You know, Poirot, the way I see it,
everybody could have done it.

1202
01:44:23,924 --> 01:44:27,337
And everybody had a reason for doing it.
It's incredible.

1203
01:44:28,345 --> 01:44:29,551
<i>Absolument.</i>

1204
01:44:31,348 --> 01:44:33,840
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

1205
01:44:42,276 --> 01:44:44,563
Good evening, Madam. Please.

1206
01:45:25,861 --> 01:45:28,068
Come quick. Quick.

1207
01:45:44,088 --> 01:45:46,079
- Fetch Dr. Bessner.
- Yes, sir.

1208
01:45:52,096 --> 01:45:53,302
You see what this is?

1209
01:45:55,766 --> 01:46:00,852
Money. Looks like a piece of a thousand
franc note. It has to be blackmail.

1210
01:46:00,980 --> 01:46:04,098
She must have known something
about Linnet Doyle's murderer.

1211
01:46:07,570 --> 01:46:09,231
What idiots we have been!

1212
01:46:10,197 --> 01:46:12,563
<i>Ah, *nom de rien!</i>
(Goshdarnit)

1213
01:46:13,909 --> 01:46:16,617
What did she say this afternoon?

1214
01:46:16,745 --> 01:46:22,661
"If I had been unable to sleep,
if I had stayed on deck,

1215
01:46:22,793 --> 01:46:24,283
I could then, perhaps,

1216
01:46:24,420 --> 01:46:28,584
have seen the assassin enter
or leave <i>Madame</i> Doyle's cabin."

1217
01:46:30,175 --> 01:46:33,338
But that is precisely what happened.
She did see the assassin!

1218
01:46:33,470 --> 01:46:36,303
And it's because of her greed
that she now lies dead!

1219
01:46:36,432 --> 01:46:40,892
Much good that does us. We still
don't know who killed either woman!

1220
01:46:41,020 --> 01:46:43,728
No, no, no, that's not quite right.

1221
01:46:43,856 --> 01:46:47,269
You see, we have been running
in the wrong direction, you and I.

1222
01:46:47,401 --> 01:46:50,939
We know almost all there is to know...

1223
01:46:52,531 --> 01:46:55,398
...except that what we know seems...

1224
01:46:56,535 --> 01:46:58,025
...seems incredible.

1225
01:46:59,914 --> 01:47:01,029
Impossible.

1226
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,913
Ah, killings.

1227
01:47:06,045 --> 01:47:10,505
Killings! All the time, killings!

1228
01:47:11,884 --> 01:47:13,215
<i>Ja.</i>

1229
01:47:14,386 --> 01:47:16,423
Dead no more than an hour.

1230
01:47:17,932 --> 01:47:19,889
The throat's been cut...

1231
01:47:21,602 --> 01:47:23,559
...with a very thin knife.

1232
01:47:27,900 --> 01:47:29,356
One like this.

1233
01:47:30,402 --> 01:47:32,063
That's very interesting, doctor.

1234
01:47:32,196 --> 01:47:34,984
Are you quite sure that
none of yours are missing?

1235
01:47:35,115 --> 01:47:36,355
<i>*Was?</i> (What?)

1236
01:47:38,452 --> 01:47:41,786
So now you think that I,
Ludwig Bessner,

1237
01:47:41,914 --> 01:47:45,147
have killed this miserable
little <i>*femme de chambre?</i> (maid)

1238
01:47:45,834 --> 01:47:47,416
<i>Oh, *Gott im Himmel!</i>
(God in heaven!)

1239
01:47:47,544 --> 01:47:51,378
What do I have to do with the squalid
affairs of the lower classes?

1240
01:47:52,424 --> 01:47:57,294
It is well known they do not have
neuroses, just animal passions!

1241
01:48:03,936 --> 01:48:06,303
- Take the body to the ice room.
- Yes, sir.

1242
01:48:09,024 --> 01:48:10,731
So you think you know, huh?

1243
01:48:10,859 --> 01:48:13,191
I must confess,
I don't see any real light myself.

1244
01:48:13,320 --> 01:48:16,187
Dr. Bessner has just told me
what happened to the maid.

1245
01:48:16,323 --> 01:48:19,907
I must speak with you
and Mr. Doyle at once.

1246
01:48:20,995 --> 01:48:23,453
I wouldn't go in there, if I were you.
Dr. Bessner is rather cross.

1247
01:48:23,580 --> 01:48:27,665
My good man, I know that. But a little
*Kraut crossness won't stop me now.

1248
01:48:27,793 --> 01:48:29,329
You see, I know.

1249
01:48:30,963 --> 01:48:33,876
Mr. Doyle, I know who
killed Louise Bourget.

1250
01:48:34,008 --> 01:48:36,966
What? You say you know
who killed Louise?

1251
01:48:37,094 --> 01:48:39,552
Ah, <i>ja</i>, not to shout!

1252
01:48:39,680 --> 01:48:42,547
And you, <i>Frau</i> Otterbourne,
you cannot be here. I forbid it.

1253
01:48:42,683 --> 01:48:43,844
My patient is resting.

1254
01:48:43,976 --> 01:48:46,138
But I must! You see,
it's vitally important!

1255
01:48:46,270 --> 01:48:48,056
You see, I know all. All, I tell you!

1256
01:48:48,188 --> 01:48:51,556
Now, look, I will not take
that pushing <i>mit *Ellbogen</i>!(elbows)

1257
01:48:51,692 --> 01:48:54,480
Mr. Doyle, I tell you that I,
Salome Otterbourne,

1258
01:48:54,611 --> 01:48:56,898
have succeeded
where frail men have faltered.

1259
01:48:57,031 --> 01:48:59,864
I am a finer sleuth
than even the great Hercule Porridge.

1260
01:48:59,992 --> 01:49:03,986
Mrs. Otterbourne,
for God's sake, calm down!

1261
01:49:04,121 --> 01:49:06,863
Now tell us the whole story,
from the beginning.

1262
01:49:07,833 --> 01:49:10,916
- I refuse to speak in front of him.
- Now look, you will not speak at all, eh?

1263
01:49:11,045 --> 01:49:14,629
New, <i>*raus, raus</i> (out). His temperature is
rising with all this disturbance.

1264
01:49:14,757 --> 01:49:17,920
Doctor, it will rise even more
if we don't hear what she has to say.

1265
01:49:18,052 --> 01:49:18,837
<i>Herr</i> Doyle...

1266
01:49:18,969 --> 01:49:22,303
We are talking about
the murderer of my wife!

1267
01:49:22,431 --> 01:49:24,672
Oh, <i>ja. Ja</i>, alright.

1268
01:49:24,808 --> 01:49:28,221
You can stay <i>drei Minuten.</i>
Three minutes.

1269
01:49:28,353 --> 01:49:31,095
And you, now, you speak softly, eh?

1270
01:49:36,653 --> 01:49:38,610
Odious little man!

1271
01:49:38,739 --> 01:49:42,983
Madam, do I understand that you have
evidence to show who killed Mrs. Doyle?

1272
01:49:43,118 --> 01:49:46,076
You do and I have.

1273
01:49:46,205 --> 01:49:48,071
You will agree, will you not,

1274
01:49:48,207 --> 01:49:52,872
that whoever killed Louise Bourget
also killed Linnet Doyle.

1275
01:49:53,003 --> 01:49:55,961
- That is quite possible.
- Well...

1276
01:49:57,216 --> 01:50:02,177
I saw who killed Louise Bourget
with my own eyes.

1277
01:50:08,560 --> 01:50:10,597
Pray continue, <i>Madame</i>.

1278
01:50:10,729 --> 01:50:14,063
I happened to be in the stern
of the boat talking to one of the crew,

1279
01:50:14,191 --> 01:50:16,774
<i>who was showing me
a most intriguing sight.</i>

1280
01:50:16,902 --> 01:50:21,521
<i>A buffalo and a camel, yoked together,
tilling the soil.</i>

1281
01:50:21,657 --> 01:50:24,991
You saw this by moonlight,
of course, <i>Madame</i>?

1282
01:50:26,662 --> 01:50:30,326
Yes, I did.
I have amazingly good eyesight.

1283
01:50:31,500 --> 01:50:32,786
Anyway, I left him.

1284
01:50:32,918 --> 01:50:37,207
<i>And suddenly, as I rounded the corner,
I heard a scream.</i>

1285
01:50:38,340 --> 01:50:41,708
<i>It came from Louise Bourget's cabin.</i>

1286
01:50:41,844 --> 01:50:44,131
<i>Then I saw the cabin door open.</i>

1287
01:50:44,263 --> 01:50:48,006
<i>As the door opened wider,
I saw that it was...</i>

1288
01:51:06,451 --> 01:51:08,067
Pennington's.

1289
01:51:22,259 --> 01:51:25,422
I heard a big boom!
What, *now, has happened?

1290
01:51:25,554 --> 01:51:27,465
Mrs. Otterbourne's been shot.

1291
01:51:33,979 --> 01:51:35,344
- Mr. Pennington?
- Yes?

1292
01:51:35,480 --> 01:51:37,767
This is your gun, I believe.

1293
01:51:37,900 --> 01:51:41,359
Anybody could have taken that gun from my cabin.
Everybody knew it was there.

1294
01:51:41,486 --> 01:51:44,649
I was saying just the other night,
I always carry a gun with me on my travels abroad.

1295
01:51:44,781 --> 01:51:47,694
It is time for these murders to stop.

1296
01:51:47,826 --> 01:51:49,942
Already, I have, unfortunately,
delayed too long.

1297
01:51:50,078 --> 01:51:54,037
I would like to see everybody,
please, in the saloon,

1298
01:51:54,166 --> 01:51:56,578
when all will be revealed.

1299
01:51:56,710 --> 01:52:01,045
In, er... 30 minutes?

1300
01:52:07,596 --> 01:52:11,931
I can't believe it. Mother dead.

1301
01:52:12,059 --> 01:52:13,299
Why?

1302
01:52:14,353 --> 01:52:19,189
- She must have found something out.
- Oh, God! Poor darling!

1303
01:52:19,316 --> 01:52:21,648
I loved her, in spite of it all.

1304
01:52:23,153 --> 01:52:24,735
And now she's gone.

1305
01:52:26,281 --> 01:52:28,067
I can't take it in.

1306
01:52:29,117 --> 01:52:30,573
Suddenly I'm...

1307
01:52:31,745 --> 01:52:33,076
All alone.

1308
01:52:35,374 --> 01:52:36,739
No, you're not.

1309
01:52:38,043 --> 01:52:39,579
I'll look after you.

1310
01:52:41,046 --> 01:52:42,787
Oh, Jim...

1311
01:52:44,675 --> 01:52:46,461
Poor Mother.

1312
01:52:46,593 --> 01:52:50,552
You'd never have got away from her.
Not while she was alive.

1313
01:53:14,329 --> 01:53:20,701
<i>Madame, mesdemoiselles, messieurs.</i>
The game is over.

1314
01:53:20,836 --> 01:53:24,295
I, Hercule Poirot, now know,
beyond a shadow of a doubt,

1315
01:53:24,423 --> 01:53:29,793
who killed <i>Madame</i> Doyle, Louise Bourget
and <i>Madame</i> Otterbourne.

1316
01:53:29,928 --> 01:53:33,216
Foolishly, I began this investigation
with the preconceived idea

1317
01:53:33,348 --> 01:53:35,089
that there must have been a witness

1318
01:53:35,225 --> 01:53:39,560
to the shooting scene between
<i>Mademoiselle</i> Jackie and Simon Doyle.

1319
01:53:40,772 --> 01:53:44,731
That this person must have taken
the gun from here,

1320
01:53:44,860 --> 01:53:47,773
after everyone had left the saloon,

1321
01:53:47,904 --> 01:53:50,236
and must have used it
to kill <i>Madame</i> Doyle

1322
01:53:50,365 --> 01:53:54,024
and to attempt to frame
<i>Mademoiselle</i> Jackie.

1323
01:53:54,053 --> 01:53:55,898
You see, <i>mes *amis,</i>
(my friends)

1324
01:53:55,900 --> 01:54:00,389
it is not as though there were
any lack of suspects among you.

1325
01:54:00,417 --> 01:54:04,877
She might have been killed by someone
trying to shut her defamatory mouth.

1326
01:54:05,005 --> 01:54:08,714
Or by someone whose father had been
ruined by <i>Madame</i> Doyle's father.

1327
01:54:08,842 --> 01:54:12,426
Or by someone obsessed
with the idea of robbery.

1328
01:54:12,554 --> 01:54:17,219
Or by someone who bitterly resented
anyone inheriting that amount of money.

1329
01:54:17,351 --> 01:54:20,844
Or by someone who was desperately
trying to save her mother

1330
01:54:20,979 --> 01:54:23,892
from financial ruin.

1331
01:54:24,024 --> 01:54:25,435
Or yet,

1332
01:54:25,567 --> 01:54:30,482
by someone anxious to escape
exposure as a fraudulent trustee.

1333
01:54:31,823 --> 01:54:36,067
Or by someone who simply mistook
the identity of the victim.

1334
01:54:42,292 --> 01:54:47,128
And then I remembered
something very important.

1335
01:54:47,255 --> 01:54:49,371
<i>On the night of the killing,
I slept heavily,</i>

1336
01:54:49,508 --> 01:54:52,375
<i>not lightly, as is my custom.
Why?</i>

1337
01:54:53,470 --> 01:54:56,212
<i>Because my wine had been drugged</i>

1338
01:54:56,348 --> 01:55:01,734
<i>by someone who did not wish me to be
present at the night's events.</i>

1339
01:55:01,800 --> 01:55:03,723
<i>This was the easiest thing in the world.</i>

1340
01:55:03,762 --> 01:55:06,823
<i>The bottles stand open on the
dining room table all day long.</i>

1341
01:55:07,150 --> 01:55:09,767
<i>You, mon colonel,
you even sent the bottle back,</i>

1342
01:55:09,903 --> 01:55:13,612
<i>saying, to use your words,
that it was "mouldy".</i>

1343
01:55:13,740 --> 01:55:19,531
<i>And this in itself plainly implies
premeditation on someone's part.</i>

1344
01:55:19,663 --> 01:55:23,406
It means that yesterday before 7:30,
when dinner was served,

1345
01:55:23,542 --> 01:55:27,080
the crime had already been decided upon.

1346
01:55:27,212 --> 01:55:30,955
I began to think back on something that has
been puzzling me from the beginning.

1347
01:55:31,091 --> 01:55:34,755
If the intention was to implicate
<i>Mademoiselle</i> Jackie,

1348
01:55:34,886 --> 01:55:38,424
why had the gun been removed
from <i>Madame</i> Doyle's cabin?

1349
01:55:38,557 --> 01:55:40,389
And then I understood.

1350
01:55:40,517 --> 01:55:45,728
The murderer had removed the gun
because he, or she, had to remove it.

1351
01:55:45,856 --> 01:55:49,520
There was no other course.
And there was more.

1352
01:55:51,027 --> 01:55:54,895
Dr. Bessner,
you examined <i>Madame</i> Doyle's body.

1353
01:55:57,284 --> 01:55:58,240
<i>Ja.</i>

1354
01:55:59,202 --> 01:56:02,911
You will remember that there were
signs of scorching round the wound.

1355
01:56:03,039 --> 01:56:03,824
<i>In other words,</i>

1356
01:56:03,957 --> 01:56:07,495
<i>the gun had been placed very close
to her head before being fired.</i>

1357
01:56:07,627 --> 01:56:08,833
That is correct.

1358
01:56:10,088 --> 01:56:13,206
But when we recovered
the gun from the Nile,

1359
01:56:13,341 --> 01:56:16,754
it was wrapped in this
brocade stole

1360
01:56:16,887 --> 01:56:19,925
and had evidently been fired
through its folds,

1361
01:56:20,056 --> 01:56:23,720
presumably in order to deaden
the sound of the shot.

1362
01:56:23,852 --> 01:56:28,722
Dr. Bessner, if it had been fired
through the stole,

1363
01:56:28,857 --> 01:56:32,691
there would have been no scorching
on <i>Madame</i> Doyle's temple.

1364
01:56:34,070 --> 01:56:37,938
In other words, the shot that killed
<i>Madame</i> Doyle could not have been fired

1365
01:56:38,074 --> 01:56:40,190
through the stole.

1366
01:56:40,327 --> 01:56:42,238
And then, perhaps,
it was the other one.

1367
01:56:42,370 --> 01:56:45,453
The one which Jacqueline
de Bellefort fired at Simon Doyle.

1368
01:56:45,582 --> 01:56:47,949
Jackie!

1369
01:56:49,377 --> 01:56:52,540
<i>But no, we have a witness for that.
We know it's not so.</i>

1370
01:56:54,090 --> 01:56:57,333
Therefore, there was a third shot.

1371
01:57:00,514 --> 01:57:03,131
One of which we know nothing.

1372
01:57:05,018 --> 01:57:10,934
But... there were only two shots
missing from the gun.

1373
01:57:20,450 --> 01:57:25,911
The next curious circumstance occurred
in <i>Madame</i> Doyle's cabin.

1374
01:57:27,082 --> 01:57:30,165
<i>In it I found two bottles
of coloured nail polish.</i>

1375
01:57:30,293 --> 01:57:35,163
<i>One bottle was labelled "Rose", but
the few drops remaining in that bottle</i>

1376
01:57:35,298 --> 01:57:37,960
<i>were not pale pink,
but bright red.</i>

1377
01:57:38,093 --> 01:57:42,553
<i>And instead of the usual smell
of pear drops; vinegar.</i>

1378
01:57:43,974 --> 01:57:50,141
Mes <i>amis,</i> it was red ink,
which formed an inevitable link

1379
01:57:50,272 --> 01:57:53,606
with this handkerchief
which we found

1380
01:57:53,733 --> 01:57:56,896
together with the gun
wrapped up in the stole.

1381
01:57:57,028 --> 01:58:01,613
And ink washes easily out of linen,
leaving a pale pink stain.

1382
01:58:03,118 --> 01:58:08,363
Then something happened which put
the matter beyond all doubt.

1383
01:58:09,541 --> 01:58:15,207
Louise Bourget was killed because
she was blackmailing the murderer.

1384
01:58:15,338 --> 01:58:19,878
We know this not only because of
the fragment of a thousand franc note

1385
01:58:20,010 --> 01:58:24,049
which we found clutched
between her dead fingers,

1386
01:58:24,180 --> 01:58:28,970
but also because of some
rather curious words she used

1387
01:58:29,102 --> 01:58:31,218
only this morning.

1388
01:58:31,354 --> 01:58:34,312
Naturally,
if I'd been unable to sleep...

1389
01:58:34,441 --> 01:58:38,059
<i>Naturally, if I had
been unable to sleep,</i>

1390
01:58:38,194 --> 01:58:39,901
<i>if I had stayed on deck,</i>

1391
01:58:40,030 --> 01:58:45,867
<i>I might then perhaps have seen the
assassin enter or leave Madame's cabin.</i>

1392
01:58:47,662 --> 01:58:50,529
Now, what exactly did that tell us?

1393
01:58:52,375 --> 01:58:58,371
What exactly did she tell
us with that?

1394
01:59:00,675 --> 01:59:04,589
That she had stayed on deck.
She did see the murderer.

1395
01:59:04,721 --> 01:59:08,464
Yes, but you still fail to see
my point, <i>mon colonel</i>, excuse me.

1396
01:59:08,600 --> 01:59:12,719
- Why did she say that to us?
- As a hint?

1397
01:59:12,854 --> 01:59:16,188
As a hint, of course,
but why hint to us?

1398
01:59:17,692 --> 01:59:20,980
She knows who the murderer is.
Alright, she can do one of two things.

1399
01:59:21,112 --> 01:59:23,774
She can tell us
or else she can keep quiet

1400
01:59:23,907 --> 01:59:27,445
and demand money
from the person concerned later.

1401
01:59:27,577 --> 01:59:29,534
But she does
neither of these two things.

1402
01:59:29,663 --> 01:59:33,782
She uses the conditional tense,
if you please. "If I had been."

1403
01:59:33,917 --> 01:59:35,282
This can mean only one thing.

1404
01:59:35,418 --> 01:59:40,254
She's hinting, alright, yes,
but she's hinting to the murderer.

1405
01:59:40,382 --> 01:59:43,124
In other words,
he was present at the time.

1406
01:59:45,679 --> 01:59:51,516
But apart from you and me,
only one other person was present.

1407
01:59:51,643 --> 01:59:54,351
Precisely. Simon Doyle.

1408
01:59:56,856 --> 01:59:58,187
What?

1409
02:00:03,405 --> 02:00:06,488
Yes. You are under the constant
supervision of Dr. Bessner.

1410
02:00:06,616 --> 02:00:09,529
She had to speak then.
She might not have got another chance.

1411
02:00:09,661 --> 02:00:13,029
- Don't be so bloody ridiculous.
- Bloody rid... Oh, I don't think I'm being ridiculous

1412
02:00:13,164 --> 02:00:16,953
I remember very clearly your answer.
"I will look after you."

1413
02:00:17,085 --> 02:00:19,998
"No one is accusing you of anything."

1414
02:00:20,130 --> 02:00:24,920
This is exactly the assurance
that she wanted, and which she got.

1415
02:00:29,389 --> 02:00:34,225
Oh, Mr. P., you really have made a fool
of yourself this time, and no mistake.

1416
02:00:34,352 --> 02:00:37,890
I mean, I've got plenty of witnesses to prove
that I couldn't possibly have killed Linnet.

1417
02:00:38,022 --> 02:00:39,262
I know you have.

1418
02:00:40,316 --> 02:00:44,560
But you did kill her
and Louise Bourget saw you.

1419
02:00:44,696 --> 02:00:46,687
Oh, what nonsense!

1420
02:00:46,823 --> 02:00:48,279
I tell you that <i>Herr</i> Doyle

1421
02:00:48,408 --> 02:00:51,446
could not have moved about the boat
with a fractured leg.

1422
02:00:51,578 --> 02:00:53,444
I tell you that I, Ludwig Bessner,

1423
02:00:53,580 --> 02:00:55,867
would testify to this
to any court in the world.

1424
02:00:55,999 --> 02:00:59,492
In that case, I would have to say
that your testimony is irrelevant.

1425
02:01:00,462 --> 02:01:04,706
- Irrelevant?
- <i>Unanwendbar.</i>

1426
02:01:04,841 --> 02:01:08,755
<i>Unanwendbar?</i> Me?

1427
02:01:10,638 --> 02:01:12,379
I have testified

1428
02:01:12,515 --> 02:01:16,429
in some of the most complex
psychological cases of the century.

1429
02:01:16,561 --> 02:01:19,269
My testimony alone saved
Strutzrumple,

1430
02:01:19,397 --> 02:01:23,186
the Dresden *Sachertorte Murderer,
from execution.

1431
02:01:23,318 --> 02:01:24,979
- And in the case...
- <i>Calmez-vous, calmez-vous.</i>

1432
02:01:25,111 --> 02:01:29,230
Your testimony is irrelevant because
you started to tend to <i>Monsieur</i> Doyle

1433
02:01:29,365 --> 02:01:31,697
five minutes after he had been shot.

1434
02:01:31,826 --> 02:01:35,490
But I tell you he could not have
moved during those five minutes.

1435
02:01:35,622 --> 02:01:38,535
I agree, if he'd been shot at
that time, but had he been?

1436
02:01:40,543 --> 02:01:44,286
Consider what had actually
been seen.

1437
02:01:44,422 --> 02:01:48,256
<i>Mademoiselle Rosalie saw
Jacqueline fire her pistol.</i>

1438
02:01:48,384 --> 02:01:52,799
<i>She saw Doyle collapse to the ﬂoor,
and then turning away to seek help,</i>

1439
02:01:52,931 --> 02:01:56,049
<i>she ran into Monsieur Ferguson,
who had heard the shot.</i>

1440
02:01:57,018 --> 02:02:01,808
<i>All he saw was Doyle clutching
a red-stained handkerchief to his leg.</i>

1441
02:02:01,940 --> 02:02:04,978
<i>He quite naturally assumed
that Doyle had been shot,</i>

1442
02:02:05,109 --> 02:02:07,771
<i>but the assumption was wrong.</i>

1443
02:02:07,904 --> 02:02:12,148
<i>The bullet had not gone into Doyle,
but elsewhere.</i>

1444
02:02:12,283 --> 02:02:13,990
<i>And now what happens?</i>

1445
02:02:14,118 --> 02:02:19,454
<i>Doyle insists that Jackie be taken away
to her cabin and not be left alone.</i>

1446
02:02:20,917 --> 02:02:22,954
<i>And so Jackie is helped
to her cabin</i>

1447
02:02:23,086 --> 02:02:25,623
<i>by Mademoiselle Rosalie
and Monsieur Ferguson.</i>

1448
02:02:25,755 --> 02:02:30,420
<i>Then, Mademoiselle Rosalie
goes to fetch Miss Bowers.</i>

1449
02:02:31,636 --> 02:02:33,673
<i>Accordingly,
all the activity is centred</i>

1450
02:02:33,805 --> 02:02:35,762
<i>on the starboard side
of the boat.</i>

1451
02:02:35,890 --> 02:02:36,800
Miss Bowers!

1452
02:02:48,695 --> 02:02:51,778
<i>Two minutes are all
that Doyle needs.</i>

1453
02:02:51,906 --> 02:02:55,570
<i>He takes of? His shoes,</i>
<i>picks up the gun from under the sofa,</i>

1454
02:02:55,702 --> 02:02:57,659
<i>where Jackie had
thoughtfully thrown it</i>

1455
02:02:57,787 --> 02:02:59,949
<i>so that it would be forgotten
until later,</i>

1456
02:03:00,081 --> 02:03:03,039
<i>and runs like a hare
along the port deck.</i>

1457
02:03:04,252 --> 02:03:07,040
<i>He then enters his wife's cabin.</i>

1458
02:03:51,090 --> 02:03:55,209
<i>Doyle then takes Madame Van Schuyler's
stole which he had previously hidden,</i>

1459
02:03:55,345 --> 02:03:57,131
<i>and wrapping up the gun in it</i>

1460
02:03:57,263 --> 02:04:01,097
<i>in order both to muffle sound
and to prevent scorching,</i>

1461
02:04:01,225 --> 02:04:04,593
<i>fires a bullet into his own leg.</i>

1462
02:04:15,198 --> 02:04:20,534
<i>He removes one of the spent cartridges,
which he disposes of,</i>

1463
02:04:20,662 --> 02:04:25,156
<i>and inserts a fresh one, thus
indicating, should the gun be found,</i>

1464
02:04:25,291 --> 02:04:28,829
<i>that only two bullets
had been fired from it.</i>

1465
02:04:43,351 --> 02:04:47,515
<i>He then rewraps the gun in the stole,
adds the stained handkerchief</i>

1466
02:04:47,647 --> 02:04:51,982
<i>and a marble ashtray to make sure
that it all sinks to the bottom,</i>

1467
02:04:52,110 --> 02:04:55,944
<i>and throws the whole bundle
out of the window into the Nile.</i>

1468
02:04:56,072 --> 02:04:58,905
<i>And now he lies back
on the sofa,</i>

1469
02:04:59,033 --> 02:05:02,867
<i>clasping a fresh handkerchief
to his leg,</i>

1470
02:05:02,996 --> 02:05:05,909
<i>this time in genuine agony.</i>

1471
02:05:14,882 --> 02:05:17,544
<i>C'est extraordinaire,
n'est-ce pas?</i>

1472
02:05:17,677 --> 02:05:20,465
It's impossible.
I can scarcely believe it.

1473
02:05:20,596 --> 02:05:23,304
Of course it is,
absolutely bloody impossible.

1474
02:05:23,433 --> 02:05:25,015
Why do you say it's impossible?

1475
02:05:25,143 --> 02:05:27,885
You yourself told me
that you heard softly running feet.

1476
02:05:28,021 --> 02:05:30,103
What reason was there for
anyone to run?

1477
02:05:30,231 --> 02:05:32,973
Yes, I know, but to do all that
on the spur of the moment?

1478
02:05:33,109 --> 02:05:36,318
Once and for all, <i>mon colonel</i>,
it was not on the spur of the moment,

1479
02:05:36,446 --> 02:05:38,813
it was carefully planned.

1480
02:05:38,948 --> 02:05:42,441
- By Doyle?
- Oh, Doyle. He merely acted the part.

1481
02:05:42,577 --> 02:05:47,913
It was planned by his accomplice,
<i>Mademoiselle</i> Jacqueline de Bellefort.

1482
02:05:51,502 --> 02:05:53,459
You must be mad!

1483
02:05:54,505 --> 02:05:57,998
No, I'm not mad.
That's the truth.

1484
02:05:59,135 --> 02:06:04,130
Who gave Doyle his alibi?
You did, by firing that shot.

1485
02:06:05,099 --> 02:06:07,841
And who gave you your alibi?

1486
02:06:07,977 --> 02:06:13,313
Doyle, by insistingb that
someone stay with you all night.

1487
02:06:13,441 --> 02:06:16,183
It's not true! It's not!

1488
02:06:16,319 --> 02:06:19,277
It is true. Why bother to deny it?

1489
02:06:20,698 --> 02:06:25,443
You and Doyle were lovers.
You still are lovers.

1490
02:06:25,578 --> 02:06:28,787
The plan was that Simon would kill
his wife, inherit the money,

1491
02:06:28,915 --> 02:06:34,285
and then aftewvards, at some later date,
marry his old love.

1492
02:06:34,420 --> 02:06:37,333
It was a very brilliant concept.

1493
02:06:37,465 --> 02:06:41,959
Your persecution of <i>Madame</i> Doyle,
Simon's feigned rage,

1494
02:06:42,095 --> 02:06:45,463
your selection of <i>Mademoiselle</i> Rosalie
as a witness,

1495
02:06:45,598 --> 02:06:50,217
and all that build-up to the shooting,
the exaggerated hysteria...

1496
02:06:51,354 --> 02:06:53,812
There was only one risk
you really took.

1497
02:06:53,940 --> 02:06:58,025
And that was that Simon's wound
simply had to be disabling.

1498
02:06:58,152 --> 02:07:02,362
Oh, and, er, pardon me,
but one piece of foolishness,

1499
02:07:02,490 --> 02:07:07,530
which was the drawing of the letter "J"
on the wall of the cabin,

1500
02:07:07,662 --> 02:07:09,903
so melodramatic it could only have
one effect.

1501
02:07:10,039 --> 02:07:11,996
That of exonerating you.

1502
02:07:12,125 --> 02:07:17,211
And who would want to do that
except an accomplice?

1503
02:07:18,673 --> 02:07:25,090
But then... the plan began
to go wrong, did it not?

1504
02:07:25,221 --> 02:07:27,838
<i>Louise Bourget has
been wakeful.</i>

1505
02:07:27,974 --> 02:07:31,057
<i>She sees Doyle
run into his wife's cabin.</i>

1506
02:07:32,436 --> 02:07:36,430
<i>She hears the shot and sees
him return to the saloon.</i>

1507
02:07:38,693 --> 02:07:41,526
<i>She makes her greedy bid
for hush money</i>

1508
02:07:41,654 --> 02:07:45,113
<i>and in doing so,
signs her own death wanant.</i>

1509
02:07:46,242 --> 02:07:50,406
<i>Herr</i> Doyle could not have killed her,
because he could not have moved.

1510
02:07:50,538 --> 02:07:53,326
- I will swear to that.
- You would be right.

1511
02:07:54,292 --> 02:07:56,408
She was killed by <i>Mademoiselle</i> Jackie.

1512
02:07:59,255 --> 02:08:01,166
No!

1513
02:08:01,299 --> 02:08:04,087
Yes, I am afraid there is no doubt.

1514
02:08:04,218 --> 02:08:07,711
Just before dinner,
she asked to see <i>Monsieur</i> Doyle.

1515
02:08:07,847 --> 02:08:12,432
<i>Quite foolishly, as it turns out,
I agreed and brought them together.</i>

1516
02:08:12,560 --> 02:08:17,350
<i>The one apparently guilt-ridden
and distraught, the other comforting.</i>

1517
02:08:17,481 --> 02:08:19,597
Oh, Simon, I'm so dreadfully sorry.

1518
02:08:19,734 --> 02:08:21,099
There, now.

1519
02:08:21,235 --> 02:08:25,900
<i>However, I'm sure as soon as
we've gone, the tone changes.</i>

1520
02:08:26,991 --> 02:08:29,358
It's going fine, darling.
We're nearly there.

1521
02:08:29,493 --> 02:08:32,281
Like hell it is! Louise knows.

1522
02:08:32,413 --> 02:08:35,531
She saw me.
She's trying to blackmail us.

1523
02:08:37,126 --> 02:08:38,833
I'll have to shut her up.

1524
02:08:40,755 --> 02:08:43,747
- Can't we pay her?
- All our lives?

1525
02:08:45,009 --> 02:08:46,499
Jackie, are you sure?

1526
02:08:57,563 --> 02:09:00,476
- Give me some money.
- Why?

1527
02:09:00,608 --> 02:09:03,976
That's what she's waiting for.
It'll put her off guard. Where is it?

1528
02:09:04,111 --> 02:09:05,647
In my jacket. In the wardrobe.

1529
02:09:23,339 --> 02:09:25,296
- I love you.
- I know.

1530
02:09:26,342 --> 02:09:27,298
Are we insane?

1531
02:09:27,426 --> 02:09:29,667
Oh, I don't know,
but we can't stop now.

1532
02:09:31,555 --> 02:09:32,886
Jackie...

1533
02:09:34,892 --> 02:09:36,508
Wish me luck.

1534
02:09:49,407 --> 02:09:51,774
<i>Unfortunately for her,
in her haste,</i>

1535
02:09:51,909 --> 02:09:55,527
<i>she leaves a tiny fragment
of a thousand franc note behind</i>

1536
02:09:55,663 --> 02:09:57,779
<i>clutched in the dead
woman's fingers.</i>

1537
02:09:57,915 --> 02:10:00,122
<i>But even more unfortunately,</i>

1538
02:10:00,251 --> 02:10:03,494
<i>she is seen by Madame Otterbourne
leaving the cabin.</i>

1539
02:10:03,629 --> 02:10:06,212
<i>She is unaware of this at the time,</i>

1540
02:10:06,340 --> 02:10:10,834
<i>and returns to Dr. Bessner's cabin
to replace the scalpel.</i>

1541
02:10:10,970 --> 02:10:16,181
<i>Then, having changed for dinner,
somewhat ﬂushed and out of breath,</i>

1542
02:10:16,309 --> 02:10:18,846
<i>she hurries into the dining room.</i>

1543
02:10:19,937 --> 02:10:21,598
As for <i>Madame</i> Otterbourne,

1544
02:10:21,731 --> 02:10:26,692
when she hears of the murder
of Louise Bourget from Dr. Bessner,

1545
02:10:26,819 --> 02:10:30,062
she suddenly realises that she has
actually seen the murderer

1546
02:10:30,197 --> 02:10:32,359
leaving the scene of the crime.

1547
02:10:32,491 --> 02:10:35,574
What? You say you know
who killed Louise?

1548
02:10:35,703 --> 02:10:37,410
Calm. Not to shout.

1549
02:10:37,538 --> 02:10:40,280
And you, <i>Frau</i>,
you cannot be here. I forbid it!

1550
02:10:40,416 --> 02:10:42,498
<i>It seemed strange to me
at the time</i>

1551
02:10:42,626 --> 02:10:46,540
<i>that Doyle should be shouting
so loudly at Madame Otterbourne.</i>

1552
02:10:46,672 --> 02:10:48,959
<i>Now, of course,
I realise that what he was doing</i>

1553
02:10:49,091 --> 02:10:51,298
<i>was shouting a warning to Jackie
next door.</i>

1554
02:10:51,427 --> 02:10:55,091
Mrs. Otterbourne, for God's sake,
calm down.

1555
02:10:55,222 --> 02:10:58,010
Now tell us the whole story,
from the beginning.

1556
02:10:58,142 --> 02:11:02,852
<i>And why did he ask her to start at
the beginning and tell the whole story?</i>

1557
02:11:02,980 --> 02:11:07,770
<i>Obviously, to give Jackie time to act,
which she did, like lightning.</i>

1558
02:11:07,902 --> 02:11:09,438
Herr Doyle...

1559
02:11:09,570 --> 02:11:12,813
We are talking about
the murderer of my wife!

1560
02:11:17,495 --> 02:11:19,031
Mr. Pennington?

1561
02:11:32,510 --> 02:11:36,094
<i>She boasted once that her father
had taught her to be a crack shot</i>

1562
02:11:36,222 --> 02:11:38,714
<i>and her boast was not an idle one.</i>

1563
02:11:38,849 --> 02:11:40,214
I saw it...

1564
02:11:42,812 --> 02:11:46,350
<i>She dropped the gun and
bolted into her own cabin next door.</i>

1565
02:11:46,482 --> 02:11:52,148
<i>It was highly risky,
but it was her only possible chance.</i>

1566
02:11:57,201 --> 02:12:00,410
<i>Voila, mes amis.</i> That is all.

1567
02:12:07,294 --> 02:12:11,663
Congratulations, Mr. P.,
on a highly amusing theory.

1568
02:12:11,799 --> 02:12:13,585
Oh, it's more than a theory.

1569
02:12:14,552 --> 02:12:17,920
Unfortunately, it is the truth.

1570
02:12:19,682 --> 02:12:23,971
Then what happened to the first bullet?
The one that Jackie fired at me?

1571
02:12:24,103 --> 02:12:28,142
Oh, that's a good question, yes.
Can you all see this table?

1572
02:12:28,274 --> 02:12:31,232
There's a newly-made bullet hole,
just there.

1573
02:12:31,360 --> 02:12:37,072
Of course, you had time to dispose of
the bullet and throw it into the Nile.

1574
02:12:37,199 --> 02:12:40,157
- What pifﬂe!
- Oh, no. It's not pifﬂe.

1575
02:12:40,286 --> 02:12:41,447
Remember, we have proof

1576
02:12:41,579 --> 02:12:44,788
that all three bullets came
from <i>Mademoiselle</i> Jacqueline's gun.

1577
02:12:44,915 --> 02:12:46,826
Suppose that's true, <i>Monsieur</i> Poirot,

1578
02:12:46,959 --> 02:12:49,371
where's the proof
that Simon fired the other two?

1579
02:12:49,503 --> 02:12:53,371
Well, that's right! You've no proof.

1580
02:12:53,507 --> 02:12:55,794
You've absolutely no proof at all.

1581
02:12:55,926 --> 02:12:58,839
We'll produce some, never fear.
You won't get away with this.

1582
02:12:58,971 --> 02:13:03,010
No? Well, you'll never convince
a jury without proof.

1583
02:13:04,268 --> 02:13:08,432
And where do you intend to get it, Mr. P.?
From Linnet?

1584
02:13:09,607 --> 02:13:12,019
Oh, no. Not from Linnet.

1585
02:13:13,903 --> 02:13:14,938
From you.

1586
02:13:16,864 --> 02:13:19,777
- From me? What do you mean?
- It's a bluff, Simon.

1587
02:13:19,909 --> 02:13:22,321
It's very far from being a bluff.

1588
02:13:22,453 --> 02:13:23,989
There is a very simple test

1589
02:13:24,121 --> 02:13:27,614
which is now accepted as conclusive
evidence in any court in the world.

1590
02:13:27,750 --> 02:13:29,991
It's called a moulage test.

1591
02:13:31,754 --> 02:13:34,121
- “Moulage test"?
- Yes, moulage.

1592
02:13:34,256 --> 02:13:36,247
You know, when you fire a gun

1593
02:13:36,383 --> 02:13:39,671
tiny grains of powder become embedded
in the skin

1594
02:13:39,803 --> 02:13:44,047
and they can now be removed
by a thin layer of wax.

1595
02:13:44,183 --> 02:13:46,720
That's a moulage test.

1596
02:13:48,896 --> 02:13:51,388
Oh, <i>mon colonel</i>,
will you administer this?

1597
02:13:51,524 --> 02:13:53,765
When you wish.

1598
02:13:55,778 --> 02:13:58,987
I assume, of course, that you're
willing to submit to such a test?

1599
02:13:59,990 --> 02:14:04,609
There is no pain involved,
just a little... warmth.

1600
02:14:16,465 --> 02:14:17,500
Jackie, what...

1601
02:14:19,593 --> 02:14:21,129
What can we do?

1602
02:14:29,061 --> 02:14:32,645
Nothing. It's over.

1603
02:14:41,615 --> 02:14:44,027
I don't mind so much, <i>Monsieur</i>.

1604
02:14:44,159 --> 02:14:46,617
About me, I mean.

1605
02:14:46,745 --> 02:14:48,611
You do mind, don't you? A bit?

1606
02:14:49,915 --> 02:14:54,125
- Yes.
- And don't judge Simon too harshly.

1607
02:14:54,253 --> 02:14:55,414
He never had any money

1608
02:14:55,546 --> 02:15:00,040
and Linnet simply dazzled him
with all that wealth.

1609
02:15:00,175 --> 02:15:03,293
Simon, do you remember what you said?

1610
02:15:04,346 --> 02:15:06,132
I said if this was a book,

1611
02:15:06,265 --> 02:15:09,929
I'd marry Linnet and she'd die
within a year and leave me everything.

1612
02:15:10,060 --> 02:15:12,802
That's when I saw the idea
come into his head.

1613
02:15:12,938 --> 02:15:16,556
I was terrified. I knew
he'd try some perfectly absurd way.

1614
02:15:16,692 --> 02:15:19,400
He even had the idea
of putting a cobra in her bed.

1615
02:15:20,988 --> 02:15:24,356
Well, you found another use
for that serpent, <i>Mademoiselle</i>.

1616
02:15:27,036 --> 02:15:28,902
I'm glad it didn't kill you, <i>Monsieur</i>.

1617
02:15:29,038 --> 02:15:31,245
- Ooof...
- Truly.

1618
02:15:34,835 --> 02:15:35,870
So you...

1619
02:15:37,463 --> 02:15:38,749
You see...

1620
02:15:40,049 --> 02:15:41,631
...I had to help him.

1621
02:15:43,761 --> 02:15:45,798
I've always had to help him.

1622
02:15:47,556 --> 02:15:49,172
Oh, Jackie, I love you.

1623
02:15:50,517 --> 02:15:51,552
I love you.

1624
02:15:58,984 --> 02:16:00,224
Stop!

1625
02:16:04,990 --> 02:16:06,776
<i>Monsieur</i> Poirot.

1626
02:16:19,922 --> 02:16:21,708
<i>Quelle tragédie.</i>

1627
02:16:37,606 --> 02:16:40,724
A splendid piece of detection,
Poirot, I must say.

1628
02:16:40,859 --> 02:16:44,523
You know, I couldn't possibly have
carried out that moulage test.

1629
02:16:44,655 --> 02:16:46,191
I have no wax.

1630
02:16:46,323 --> 02:16:49,987
You astonish me, <i>mon colonel</i>.
You absolutely astonish me.

1631
02:16:53,163 --> 02:16:55,780
Goodbye, <i>Monsieur</i> Poirot.

1632
02:16:55,916 --> 02:16:57,998
I'm afraid the description
of your cases

1633
02:16:58,127 --> 02:17:00,585
will have to wait until another time.

1634
02:17:00,713 --> 02:17:02,329
<i>Oh, quel *dommage, Madame!</i>
(a pity)

1635
02:17:02,464 --> 02:17:05,798
I was hoping to recount to you
my recent extraordinary experience

1636
02:17:05,926 --> 02:17:08,884
on the Orient Express.

1637
02:17:09,012 --> 02:17:11,094
Come on, Bowers. Time to go.

1638
02:17:11,223 --> 02:17:15,387
This place is beginning
to resemble a mortuary.

1639
02:17:15,519 --> 02:17:18,887
Thank God, you'll be in one yourself
before too long.

1640
02:17:19,022 --> 02:17:21,639
- Bloody old fossil.
- Temper, temper, Bowers!

1641
02:17:21,775 --> 02:17:24,392
What you need is a nice cool holiday.

1642
02:17:24,528 --> 02:17:29,022
I was thinking of a trip
through the Gobi Desert.

1643
02:17:32,578 --> 02:17:35,366
<i>Monsieur</i> Poirot,♥
I wanted you to be the first to know.

1644
02:17:35,497 --> 02:17:36,737
We've just got engaged.

1645
02:17:36,874 --> 02:17:39,161
<i>Oh, mes félicitations, mademoiselle.</i>

1646
02:17:40,127 --> 02:17:41,663
- <i>Monsieur</i>.
- Congratulations.

1647
02:17:41,795 --> 02:17:43,957
- And <i>bonne chance</i> to both of you.
- Thank you.

1648
02:17:44,089 --> 02:17:46,205
- Goodbye, <i>Monsieur</i> Poirot.
- Goodbye, sir.

1649
02:17:46,341 --> 02:17:47,797
- Colonel Race.
- Good luck.

1650
02:17:50,888 --> 02:17:54,051
<i>Oh, mes *petits</i>! A word of advice.
(kids)

1651
02:17:54,183 --> 02:17:59,269
As they say in America, "take it easy".

1652
02:17:59,396 --> 02:18:00,852
We'll try.

1653
02:18:09,239 --> 02:18:12,948
- What are you thinking?
- I was thinking of Moliére.

1654
02:18:13,076 --> 02:18:17,491
<i>"La grande ambition des femmes
est d'inspiner l'amour."</i>

1655
02:18:17,623 --> 02:18:20,615
I do wish you'd speak
some known language.

1656
02:18:20,751 --> 02:18:25,461
"The great ambition of women
is to inspire love."

1657
