00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:35,655
Nice and tall. Smiling.
Good.

2
00:02:35,687 --> 00:02:39,758
Now line up along the line.
Very good.

3
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:43,896
Now today, I want to see
your best cartwheel.

4
00:02:47,432 --> 00:02:51,637
So I'm gonna spread out nice
and tall. Point my toes.

5
00:02:51,669 --> 00:02:55,207
Just like that. Easy.

6
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:58,211
Alright. Your turn now.
Spread out.

7
00:02:58,243 --> 00:03:01,646
Off you go.

8
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,818
Well, that was very good.

9
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:11,257
You still have exquisite control
despite not doing gym for years.

10
00:03:11,289 --> 00:03:15,360
Bev. No my time is well and
truly past...

11
00:03:15,394 --> 00:03:19,397
But I do love coaching.
- Well, that's what I wanted
to...

12
00:03:19,431 --> 00:03:23,603
talk to you about.
- Very good handstand Emma.

13
00:03:23,635 --> 00:03:25,937
I was hoping

14
00:03:25,971 --> 00:03:28,875
you could take over coaching
the level 6 gymnasts for me?

15
00:03:34,847 --> 00:03:37,350
I couldn't possibly.

16
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:39,352
Why can't you continue?

17
00:03:39,384 --> 00:03:41,286
Oh well, you know...

18
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:44,522
I've not been well and I have to
have a few tests done.

19
00:03:44,556 --> 00:03:49,395
Plus the girls need someone
younger, they need someone
who...

20
00:03:49,427 --> 00:03:52,031
can devote more time and energy
to them than I can.

21
00:03:52,063 --> 00:03:56,301
I would love to help.
But I just couldn't.

22
00:03:56,335 --> 00:04:02,242
I understand. But you'll
have to deal with it one day.

23
00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:04,911
Sorry Bev.

24
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:17,456
I'm sorry girls. She can't.

25
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:24,963
What's the matter with you?

26
00:04:24,997 --> 00:04:27,766
Is it because of me
she won't coach?

27
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:32,905
- Oh, Maddy, no, it's nothing
like that, it's just... [Coughs]

28
00:04:32,937 --> 00:04:35,640
...she has her reasons,
that's all.

29
00:04:35,673 --> 00:04:38,943
Are you OK?
- Mmmm... Yeah, I'm fine.

30
00:04:38,976 --> 00:04:44,483
That's it for tonight.
Time to pack up and go home.

31
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,456
I'm heading off Bev. You OK
to lock up?

32
00:04:50,488 --> 00:04:52,858
Yeah, that's fine Kate.
- See you tomorrow.

33
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,764
[Footsteps]

34
00:05:02,935 --> 00:05:04,470
Doh!

35
00:05:12,377 --> 00:05:13,612
Bev?

36
00:05:16,714 --> 00:05:19,751
Bev!

37
00:05:19,785 --> 00:05:23,723
Bev! What is it?
- I can't breathe!
[Labored breathing]

38
00:05:23,755 --> 00:05:26,758
OK, don't panic.

39
00:05:36,468 --> 00:05:38,938
Bev?
- Oh, Kate.

40
00:05:42,908 --> 00:05:45,878
Thanks for coming.

41
00:05:45,911 --> 00:05:48,047
How are you?

42
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:52,951
I'm getting better.
I can breathe now. [laughing]

43
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:57,723
But... They've...
they've scheduled the
operation for tomorrow.

44
00:05:57,755 --> 00:05:59,791
Wow!

45
00:05:59,824 --> 00:06:03,896
That's better sooner than
later, get you back to normal.

46
00:06:03,928 --> 00:06:06,931
I'm sorry to ask again,
but could you please...

47
00:06:06,964 --> 00:06:10,835
... look after and train
the level 6 girls for me?

48
00:06:10,869 --> 00:06:13,906
Of course. How can I refuse now?
[Laughing]

49
00:06:15,874 --> 00:06:19,011
But only until you're better,
ok?

50
00:06:19,043 --> 00:06:21,813
OK.

51
00:06:21,846 --> 00:06:23,882
Thank you Kate.

52
00:06:25,716 --> 00:06:26,985
Thank you.

53
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:38,062
OK. Erin? Kayla, Maddy?

54
00:06:38,096 --> 00:06:40,733
Lets see what you
can do on the floor.

55
00:07:16,201 --> 00:07:19,838
Really, really good girls.

56
00:07:19,872 --> 00:07:24,643
Maddy...just focus on your own
moves and you'll be terrific.

57
00:07:24,675 --> 00:07:26,911
How've have you been going
in the competitions?

58
00:07:26,944 --> 00:07:28,646
Winning easily?

59
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,650
Us?
You must be joking!

60
00:07:31,682 --> 00:07:33,752
We get caned by
Saints every time.

61
00:07:33,785 --> 00:07:35,054
Saints huh?

62
00:07:36,721 --> 00:07:38,824
They were never any
good in my day.

63
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:42,961
We'll have to see about that.

64
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:44,997
Come on. We've got work to do.

65
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:55,508
Guess what's first lesson
today for Kayla?

66
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:57,709
Hmm... Let me think.

67
00:07:57,742 --> 00:07:58,711
You know exactly what it is.

68
00:07:58,744 --> 00:08:00,045
Wild Guess... Dance?

69
00:08:00,077 --> 00:08:03,548
I hate dance! I never
get the moves right.

70
00:08:03,581 --> 00:08:06,552
At least it's your last
lesson today.

71
00:08:06,584 --> 00:08:10,055
Yes! Fortunately. Did I tell you
that I hate dance?

72
00:08:10,088 --> 00:08:12,658
Yes. Constantly!

73
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:15,860
So, What do you think of our new
coach Miss Kate Jones?

74
00:08:15,894 --> 00:08:18,631
Really good girls...
She's alright I guess.

75
00:08:18,663 --> 00:08:20,966
What about you Maddy?

76
00:08:20,999 --> 00:08:24,069
I liked her. I reckon
she'll put in for us.

77
00:08:24,101 --> 00:08:27,305
She's only doing it for Bev.
She'll drop us as soon as Bev's
OK.

78
00:08:27,338 --> 00:08:28,774
Yeah, I guess.

79
00:08:28,807 --> 00:08:30,042
Oh-oh....

80
00:08:34,779 --> 00:08:38,116
Hi girls. Coming to the State
Championships on the weekend?

81
00:08:38,149 --> 00:08:39,250
What's it to you?

82
00:08:39,283 --> 00:08:42,053
You're going, aren't you Maddy?

83
00:08:42,086 --> 00:08:44,122
Yeah, we all are.

84
00:08:44,155 --> 00:08:48,092
Great! You girls are so hopeless
you make us look more fantastic!

85
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:51,930
If that's possible.
Right Girls?

86
00:08:51,964 --> 00:08:55,835
One day I'm gonna show her.
- Show her what?

87
00:08:57,068 --> 00:08:59,038
Just show her.

88
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:15,887
Nearly Maddy. Try it again.
You can do it!

89
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:35,807
It's no use.
I'm not good enough!

90
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:37,909
Maddy, try it again.

91
00:09:37,942 --> 00:09:41,312
This time, when you get to here,
use the momentum to push.

92
00:09:41,346 --> 00:09:42,815
Don't hold back.

93
00:09:48,019 --> 00:09:50,088
Now push!

94
00:09:50,121 --> 00:09:53,925
There see. You're nearly there.

95
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:57,261
OK. Now we're going to finish
off on your floor routines.

96
00:09:57,294 --> 00:09:58,296

Competition tomorrow, hey girls?
Should be interesting.

105

Never quite feel you're
prepared.

106
00:11:30,989 --> 00:11:33,725
Does anyone need a ride?

107
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,394
What, all three of you?

108
00:11:36,427 --> 00:11:38,864
Don't your parents come?

109
00:11:38,897 --> 00:11:40,833
My mum and dad
aren't really interested.

110
00:11:40,865 --> 00:11:45,203
My mum and dad normally come
and we always take Erin...

111
00:11:45,236 --> 00:11:48,139
... but tomorrow they're going
to my brother's sports day.

112
00:11:48,173 --> 00:11:51,342
That's rides for 2 of you.
What about you Maddy?

113
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:54,446
My dad always comes
but he has to work.

114
00:11:54,479 --> 00:11:56,148
He'll pop in later though.

115
00:11:56,181 --> 00:11:58,450
OK. What about your mum?

116
00:11:58,482 --> 00:12:02,453
My mum died when I was eight.

117
00:12:02,486 --> 00:12:04,389
Sorry, Maddy.

118
00:12:04,422 --> 00:12:08,160

is not good.

The concussion will pass
in a few days.

130

We still need to do some testing
but I have to tell you...

131
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:47,225

kind enough to pick me up
and bring me down here.

but to take it out on Maddy?

to find a way for Maddy to win.

better than the other teams.

00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:08,413
Does this mean you'll
keep coaching them?

177
00:19:08,445 --> 00:19:11,448
Oh, the girls are OK,
and I don't mind coaching.

178
00:19:11,481 --> 00:19:13,817
Now with Sally...

179
00:19:13,851 --> 00:19:17,189
I'm not going
to let her beat me.

180
00:19:17,221 --> 00:19:19,624
Well you'll need assistance
from a top coach.

181
00:19:19,656 --> 00:19:21,659
You should ask Shane Fuller.

182
00:19:21,692 --> 00:19:24,663
He is a strength
and technique coach.

183
00:19:24,695 --> 00:19:26,564
Great idea!
Do you have his number?

184
00:19:26,597 --> 00:19:31,368
No need. He's...
He's just over there.

185
00:19:31,402 --> 00:19:34,439
Oh no!

186
00:19:34,471 --> 00:19:36,942
Why? What happened?

187
00:19:36,974 --> 00:19:38,842
Don't ask.
I'm too embarrassed.

188
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:42,213
Are you sure he's that good?

189
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:44,950
Probably no one better.

190
00:19:44,982 --> 00:19:49,587
[Sigh] Alright... here goes.
-[Chuckles]

191
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:59,730
[Background chatter]

192
00:20:02,567 --> 00:20:06,771
Hey, great job on your
judging again, Sally.

193
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:47,412
Gee, you were lucky to get
the silver with that

194
00:20:47,444 --> 00:20:49,913
seasick routine of yours,
Maddy's was really good!

195
00:20:49,946 --> 00:20:53,584
Maddy's was good!
Better than Chelsea's.

196
00:20:53,617 --> 00:20:54,885
Hey Maddy?

197
00:20:54,919 --> 00:20:57,055
Gee, that was a
great floor routine.

198
00:20:57,087 --> 00:21:00,557
Thanks?

199
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:03,060
Even with your best performance
all you could manage was 4th?

200
00:21:03,094 --> 00:21:05,529
Why don't you just do yourself
a favor and quit?

201
00:21:05,563 --> 00:21:08,700
The closest thing that you'll
get to a medal is that metal
in your mouth.

202
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:03,922
[knock at door]

203
00:22:03,954 --> 00:22:05,990
[Door Opens]

204
00:22:06,022 --> 00:22:08,092
You OK?

205
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:12,696
Yeah. Just the kids at school
are making fun of me again.

206
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:15,733
I wish I was more
like the other kids.

207
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:18,603
I know other kids
can be mean.

208
00:22:18,635 --> 00:22:20,806
I'm so proud of you though.

209
00:22:23,173 --> 00:22:26,411
And you know?
You're so like your mum.

210
00:22:27,545 --> 00:22:29,480
If she was here

211
00:22:29,513 --> 00:22:33,351
well I know she'd just
be beaming with pride.

212
00:22:34,786 --> 00:22:36,955
I miss her so much dad.

213
00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:39,423
Me too kiddo.

214
00:22:39,457 --> 00:22:40,859
Me too.

215
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:48,899
Come on girls!

216
00:22:48,932 --> 00:22:50,669
Stick with it, Maddy.

217
00:22:53,438 --> 00:22:55,407
Kate, why won't you reconsider
getting Shane in?

218
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,009
It would really help
you and the girls!

219
00:22:58,041 --> 00:23:02,146
Nope. I can do it on my own.

220
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:06,618
Why not take this
weekend off, come and
watch the boys competition?

221
00:23:06,651 --> 00:23:09,153
I mean, if you won't
ask for help

222
00:23:09,186 --> 00:23:13,625
you might as well pick
up some pointers by watching.

223
00:23:13,657 --> 00:23:17,762
Maddy! Really!
Can't you stick
to your own area?

224
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:25,002
Actually, we could use a break.

225
00:23:25,036 --> 00:23:29,106
The girls are really struggling.
Especially Maddy.

226
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:31,443
They told me how Chelsea
ripped into her.

227
00:23:31,476 --> 00:23:32,978
Ohh.

228
00:23:34,511 --> 00:23:37,816
OK. Take a break.

229
00:23:37,848 --> 00:23:40,451
C'mon. Let's go for a drink.

230
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:43,488
[Music throughout competition]

231
00:24:09,547 --> 00:24:11,549
See the strength?

232
00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:19,891
And the technique?

233
00:24:24,795 --> 00:24:26,998
Yeah, I see it!

234
00:24:34,939 --> 00:24:36,875
Look, there's Shane.

235
00:24:36,907 --> 00:24:39,776
You could still ask
him for help!
- No!

236
00:24:39,809 --> 00:24:42,679
Bev, no!
- Shane? Smile! Shane?

237
00:24:42,712 --> 00:24:46,116
Hello, Shane.
- Hi, Beverly.

238
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:47,951
Your boys are performing
very well.

239
00:24:47,984 --> 00:24:49,953
Yeah, so far so good.

240
00:24:49,987 --> 00:24:51,689
It's not over yet though.

241
00:24:51,721 --> 00:24:54,057
This is Kate Jones.
- Nice to meet you.

242
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:56,159
Haven't we met before?

243
00:24:56,192 --> 00:25:00,731
No. Well we sort of crossed
paths at the last competition.

244
00:25:00,765 --> 00:25:04,235
Yes. Now I remember.
- Um Kate wanted to speak
to you.

245
00:25:04,268 --> 00:25:08,873
Yeah I was...
I was wondering if, maybe...

246
00:25:08,905 --> 00:25:11,209
Look, I'll help you.
-You will?

247
00:25:11,241 --> 00:25:13,211
Yeah sure, look.
It's just a small thing.

248
00:25:13,243 --> 00:25:15,212
It just happened.
Don't worry about it.

249
00:25:15,246 --> 00:25:16,648
I accept your apology.

250
00:25:17,748 --> 00:25:21,952
Apology? Apologize?

251
00:25:21,986 --> 00:25:24,188
Well, that's what you we're
going to ask wasn't it?

252
00:25:24,221 --> 00:25:27,791
Last time we met you were
insulting towards Sally
as I remember?

253
00:25:27,825 --> 00:25:30,562
No. Sally?

254
00:25:30,595 --> 00:25:34,065
Well, I think you're
the one who owes the apology.

255
00:25:34,097 --> 00:25:36,567
[Laughs]
I don't see what for?

256
00:25:36,601 --> 00:25:39,103
Look, I've got to get back
to the competition.

257
00:25:39,135 --> 00:25:42,307
Another time maybe.

258
00:25:42,339 --> 00:25:44,641
That went well.

259
00:25:44,674 --> 00:25:47,311
Conceited, arrogant, prat!

260
00:25:51,848 --> 00:25:54,051
Thanks a lot for that!

261
00:25:54,085 --> 00:25:58,823
It's not my fault you can't
talk to a man.

262
00:26:18,776 --> 00:26:19,978
[Clapping]
Yeah!

263
00:26:40,096 --> 00:26:45,403
So proud of you boys!
Good work today!

264
00:26:45,435 --> 00:26:47,337
So, did you enjoy that?

265
00:26:47,371 --> 00:26:50,108
I am glad we went.

266
00:26:50,141 --> 00:26:54,946
Yes. It's good to see the way
they deal with things.

267
00:26:54,979 --> 00:26:57,048
You're right as always.
- Oh no.

268
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,082
I've left my bag behind.

269
00:26:59,115 --> 00:27:00,751
One of the girls will get it
for you.

270
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:02,687
Girls?
- No! no... It's fine.

271
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,154
Are you sure?

272
00:27:04,188 --> 00:27:07,859
Yes! Go ahead, get the car
and meet me back here.

273
00:27:07,892 --> 00:27:08,860
OK.

274
00:27:13,864 --> 00:27:16,299
Shane!

275
00:27:16,333 --> 00:27:17,835
Hey, Beverley.

276
00:27:17,867 --> 00:27:20,203
How are you?
I meant to ask you before.

277
00:27:20,237 --> 00:27:22,940
Oh, I'm getting better,
just one day at a time.

278
00:27:22,972 --> 00:27:25,042
Hey, congratulations
on the win today.

279
00:27:25,076 --> 00:27:27,077
Ah, the boys did it.
It wasn't me.

280
00:27:27,111 --> 00:27:29,881
[Chuckle]
I think you're being
a little modest.

281
00:27:29,913 --> 00:27:33,785
I was wondering if you could
help our girls team

282
00:27:33,817 --> 00:27:35,118
with specialized training?

283
00:27:35,152 --> 00:27:37,455
Well sure, but isn't Kate
in charge?

284
00:27:37,488 --> 00:27:39,090
Oh, yes, yes she is.

285
00:27:39,123 --> 00:27:40,857
and she's doing a terrific job,
It's just that.

286
00:27:40,891 --> 00:27:43,728
the girls need some extra
strength and technique training.

287
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:48,066
And Kate was keen to ask you
but after her little
altercations with you.

288
00:27:48,098 --> 00:27:49,299
now she feels she can't.

289
00:27:49,333 --> 00:27:51,469
You mean today and
at the girls gym?

290
00:27:51,501 --> 00:27:53,403
[Chuckle]
Ah, tell her it was nothing.
Tell her to forget about it.

291
00:27:53,436 --> 00:27:57,474
Sure. I'll help.

292
00:27:57,508 --> 00:28:01,078
Yeah! Look at that form!
One more for good luck.

293
00:28:03,012 --> 00:28:05,982
That's beautiful!
This time I want to see your

294
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:09,019
full run up with a half
twist through the air, OK?

295
00:28:14,191 --> 00:28:15,759
Yeah, Maddy, nice and strong.

296
00:28:15,792 --> 00:28:17,728
Beautiful momentum through
that run up.

297
00:28:17,761 --> 00:28:20,197
This time I want you to go
through your full run up

298
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:22,967
and then go into a full twist
while you're in the air, OK?

299
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,371
A layout backsault with
a full twist?

300
00:28:27,403 --> 00:28:30,842
I could never do that!
- Oh, I reckon you could.

301
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:32,109
You've got everything.

302
00:28:32,143 --> 00:28:34,444
Everything you've just
done alright?

303
00:28:34,478 --> 00:28:36,881
So you've got your arms,
and then head.

304
00:28:40,084 --> 00:28:42,420
C'mon, Maddy.
- C'mon.

305
00:28:42,452 --> 00:28:44,288
Go for it girl.
- GFG!

306
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,090
GFG?

307
00:28:47,124 --> 00:28:52,395
Go for it girl. GFG!
- Oh yeah! Sweet!

308
00:28:52,429 --> 00:28:54,398
C'mon, Maddy.
-C'mon. GFG!

309
00:28:54,431 --> 00:28:58,769
GFG! GFG! GFG!
GFG! GFG! GFG!

310
00:29:01,204 --> 00:29:03,006
Woah!
-Maddy!

311
00:29:04,141 --> 00:29:06,411
Maddy, are you OK?

312
00:29:10,146 --> 00:29:13,250
Maddy, that was a lay out
backsault with nearly
a full twist!

313
00:29:13,284 --> 00:29:15,920
I haven't been able to get you
to do a 1/2 twist let alone

314
00:29:15,952 --> 00:29:17,020
the full one!

315
00:29:17,054 --> 00:29:19,190
How on earth?

316
00:29:21,925 --> 00:29:26,931
Oh, now it all makes sense.
Let me guess.

317
00:29:26,963 --> 00:29:28,832
Beverley asked you
here yesterday, right?

318
00:29:28,865 --> 00:29:30,033
Yeah.

319
00:29:30,067 --> 00:29:32,202
Can he help us?
- He wants to. Please?

320
00:29:32,236 --> 00:29:36,841
- Please, Please, Please?
- He wants to help us.

321
00:29:36,874 --> 00:29:40,044
Alright.
- Yes!

322
00:29:41,912 --> 00:29:43,213
I just hope Shane knows
what he's in for!

323
00:29:43,247 --> 00:29:47,250
Yes! Yes! Yes!
Thank you!

324
00:29:47,284 --> 00:29:51,989
Alright. Careful, careful!
Alright. No more full twists OK?

325
00:29:52,021 --> 00:29:57,060
Right, back to it. You're going
to have to rest that for a week!

326
00:30:03,867 --> 00:30:06,971
Finish off with some
floor exercises.

327
00:30:07,003 --> 00:30:09,173
That's good. Nice and strong.

328
00:30:09,205 --> 00:30:12,309
Yeah, Maddy, you can sit out.

329
00:30:12,343 --> 00:30:16,247
Nice and straight,
nice and strong. Beautiful.

330
00:30:16,279 --> 00:30:20,017
OK, straight into dish. Quick!

331
00:30:20,049 --> 00:30:24,489
One... Two...
- OK. That'll do for today.

332
00:30:26,289 --> 00:30:28,024
Wow, look the girls are
really good.

333
00:30:28,057 --> 00:30:30,461
Especially Maddy.

334
00:30:30,493 --> 00:30:33,530
Yeah, they are good.
I think Maddy's exceptional.

335
00:30:33,564 --> 00:30:35,932
She just lacks confidence.

336
00:30:35,965 --> 00:30:39,369
Do you think I could bring my
boys around & combine training?

337
00:30:39,403 --> 00:30:41,072
That way I'd get more time
with them.

338
00:30:41,105 --> 00:30:42,906
That sounds really good!

339
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:45,308
I mean, whatever will help the
girls. I really want them

340
00:30:45,342 --> 00:30:46,544
to win the next comp.
- Yeah.

341
00:30:51,048 --> 00:30:52,650
Oh.

342
00:30:52,682 --> 00:30:54,184
Here they are.

343
00:30:54,218 --> 00:30:58,990
[Inaudible whispering,
and laughing]

344
00:30:59,022 --> 00:31:02,225
Alright, girls,
let me introduce my boys team.

345
00:31:02,259 --> 00:31:06,631
This is Matthew. This is
Harrison. And this is Joshua.

346
00:31:06,663 --> 00:31:09,099
Duh! They are our friends
on Facebook.

347
00:31:09,133 --> 00:31:11,903
Erin, manners please.

348
00:31:11,935 --> 00:31:16,307
Well sorry. But they are friends
and Josh goes to our school.

349
00:31:16,339 --> 00:31:19,143
So we do know them.
- Of course! Facebook!

350
00:31:19,175 --> 00:31:22,913
Starting out with warm-up
stretches.

351
00:31:22,946 --> 00:31:24,548
In a line facing each other.

352
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:29,019
And arm swings.
- Feet nice and close together.

353
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:30,521
C'mon Josh, you know this.

354
00:31:30,554 --> 00:31:32,957
Nice and tight up
through the body.

355
00:31:34,223 --> 00:31:36,994
Left arm... Good.

356
00:31:38,528 --> 00:31:39,596
[Crickets]

357
00:31:53,978 --> 00:31:55,279
[Sigh]

358
00:32:12,762 --> 00:32:18,234
Shane. Hi.
- Kate. Hi, what time is it?

359
00:32:18,268 --> 00:32:21,271
Oh, yeah, it is a bit late.

360
00:32:21,305 --> 00:32:23,606
Yeah. What's up anyway?

361
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:28,646
Um. Well, there's only 2 weeks
to the next competition.

362
00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:31,248
Can I met with you to discuss
the girls' progress?

363
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:36,354
Is that all you rang for? Yeah,
but only if it's over dinner.

364
00:32:36,386 --> 00:32:39,623
Well, fine.

365
00:32:39,655 --> 00:32:42,192
But I get
to pick the restaurant.

366
00:32:42,226 --> 00:32:45,262
Deal! Tomorrow night at 6:00?

367
00:32:45,295 --> 00:32:48,699
Great, I'll text you where
to meet me.

368
00:32:48,731 --> 00:32:51,101
Thanks.

369
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:22,298
Ahh. This is not exactly
what I had in mind.

370
00:33:22,332 --> 00:33:24,602
Yeah, I suspected
what you had in mind,

371
00:33:24,634 --> 00:33:26,269
which is why I chose here.

372
00:33:26,303 --> 00:33:29,206
Oh really?
What did I have in mind?

373
00:33:29,239 --> 00:33:31,709
Here, I've ordered for you.

374
00:33:33,443 --> 00:33:38,715
So. What can we do to give
the girls a real edge?

375
00:33:40,616 --> 00:33:43,086
Well, to advance they need
strength development.

376
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:44,654
Aha.

377
00:33:44,688 --> 00:33:46,357
I know you can get it
out of the boys apparatus.

378
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:49,427
We could train them
on the boys equipment?

379
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,495
That's a bit radical.

380
00:33:51,528 --> 00:33:55,165
Has it worked in the past?
- I don't know!

381
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:56,534
I've never done it before.

382
00:33:56,567 --> 00:33:58,301
[Laughing]

383
00:33:58,335 --> 00:34:00,638
The boys equipment!?!

384
00:34:00,671 --> 00:34:04,607
Yes. The boys equipment.

385
00:34:04,641 --> 00:34:07,378
Now boys, this is all about
helping the girls.

386
00:34:07,411 --> 00:34:12,650
Matthew, you're with Kayla.
Harry, you're with Erin.

387
00:34:12,682 --> 00:34:14,784
And Josh, you're with Maddy.

388
00:34:14,818 --> 00:34:17,855
Alright. Let's get into it.

389
00:34:17,887 --> 00:34:21,458
Did I mention you are all teams?

390
00:34:21,492 --> 00:34:25,162
Whoever does the most chin ups,
pull ups on the rings,

391
00:34:25,195 --> 00:34:27,698
and dips on the bars will
win the prize.

392
00:34:30,534 --> 00:34:32,536
What's the prize?

393
00:34:32,568 --> 00:34:34,672
You are direct aren't you?

394
00:34:34,704 --> 00:34:36,673
I want to know what the prize is
if I'm gonna have to work with
him!

395
00:34:36,706 --> 00:34:40,210
Rest assured, it will be good.
- It better be.

396
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:43,548
C'mon.

397
00:34:45,882 --> 00:34:49,719
Prize? When did you come
up with that?

398
00:34:49,753 --> 00:34:52,856
When none of them moved.

399
00:34:52,889 --> 00:34:56,594
I've got no idea what to
use as a prize.
-[laughter]

400
00:35:02,231 --> 00:35:04,802
It shouldn't be hard, yeah?

401
00:35:04,835 --> 00:35:08,405
Well, if you can do it it can't
be that hard.

402
00:35:08,438 --> 00:35:10,141
Whoops!

403
00:35:18,315 --> 00:35:19,617
Argh!

404
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:36,834
Tst.

405
00:35:44,507 --> 00:35:45,842
[Doorbell]

406
00:35:52,849 --> 00:35:55,253
[Doorbell]

407
00:36:03,994 --> 00:36:05,663
Yes?

408
00:36:06,896 --> 00:36:10,500
Is... Is Maddy at home?

409
00:36:11,601 --> 00:36:14,938
Maybe.
Who might you be?

410
00:36:14,972 --> 00:36:20,311
I'm Joshua.
I'm helping Maddy at the gym.

411
00:36:21,311 --> 00:36:23,747
Hmm.

412
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:26,584
May I please speak to Maddy?

413
00:36:26,617 --> 00:36:30,754
Sure. Come on in.
I'll get Maddy for you.

414
00:36:30,786 --> 00:36:33,456
Josh! What are you doing here?

415
00:36:33,489 --> 00:36:36,459
I think that's pretty obvious!
He's come to see you kiddo.

416
00:36:36,492 --> 00:36:38,728
Spruce yourself up!

417
00:36:38,762 --> 00:36:43,901
Don't want to look like the cat
dragged you in.

418
00:36:43,934 --> 00:36:49,440
Well, I've got some things to do
out in the out in the shed.

419
00:36:59,983 --> 00:37:02,519
Nice to meet you Joshua.

420
00:37:02,552 --> 00:37:06,289
I'll be out in the garage
if you need me, Maddy.

421
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,296
You done your homework yet?

422
00:37:13,329 --> 00:37:16,799
Yeah, that was easy.
I love working out those
problems in my head.

423
00:37:16,833 --> 00:37:19,536
Really?
- You?

424
00:37:19,568 --> 00:37:21,337
I'm pretty hopeless.

425
00:37:21,371 --> 00:37:23,641
I could sort of help you a bit.
- Oh cool...

426
00:37:23,673 --> 00:37:25,376
I'll go get my books.

427
00:37:48,931 --> 00:37:50,467
Sorry.

428
00:37:53,036 --> 00:37:55,371
Ouch!

429
00:37:55,405 --> 00:37:58,542
Well, I was gonna use my head.
But not quite like that!

430
00:38:05,047 --> 00:38:09,486
[Inaudible chatter]

431
00:38:11,454 --> 00:38:14,490
Well, what do you reckon Hunter?
Hey?

432
00:38:14,523 --> 00:38:16,592
Have we given them enough time?

433
00:38:16,626 --> 00:38:18,963
C'mon. Let's go.

434
00:38:21,764 --> 00:38:23,500
Could you really not work
this out?

435
00:38:23,532 --> 00:38:25,335
I just got a bit confused
alright?

436
00:38:25,369 --> 00:38:26,570
It's full reception.

437
00:38:26,603 --> 00:38:28,673
Don't be mean.

438
00:38:37,646 --> 00:38:40,851
How's it going guys, alright?
- Yep...

439
00:38:40,884 --> 00:38:42,119
Fine dad.

440
00:38:42,152 --> 00:38:44,088
Yeah, good, Mr Cornell.

441
00:38:50,059 --> 00:38:54,364
So, what are you working on?
- It's actually very
interesting.

442
00:39:04,141 --> 00:39:06,976
Did you see Josh is with
that little cow Maddy?

443
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:10,914
Nuh. Who? What?

444
00:39:10,947 --> 00:39:12,750
Maddy and Joshua Phelps.

445
00:39:12,782 --> 00:39:14,684
Well, Joshua Phelps.
Like, who cares?

446
00:39:14,717 --> 00:39:17,453
I do! I'm gonna teach her
a lesson.

447
00:39:17,487 --> 00:39:20,023
Don't you sit next to him in IT?
- Yeah.

448
00:39:20,056 --> 00:39:21,958
I want you to swap with me.

449
00:39:25,728 --> 00:39:27,096
What are you doing?

450
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:30,834
Catherine sits there.
- Oh, I asked to swap.

451
00:39:30,867 --> 00:39:32,669
I hoped you could help me
with the assignment.

452
00:39:32,702 --> 00:39:34,805
You? As if you need help.

453
00:39:34,838 --> 00:39:39,810
Well this web stuff's too hard
for me.

454
00:39:39,842 --> 00:39:41,811
How do you get pictures in it?

455
00:39:41,844 --> 00:39:43,646
That's easy. You just--

456
00:40:02,565 --> 00:40:05,602
Thank you for your help, Josh.
- That's alright.

457
00:40:13,043 --> 00:40:15,746
What are you doing?

458
00:40:15,778 --> 00:40:19,215
Did she see?
- Oh, yeah, big time!

459
00:40:19,248 --> 00:40:21,551
She ran off behind
the classroom.

460
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:23,887
Sucks to be her!

461
00:40:39,235 --> 00:40:41,070
What's up with you today?

462
00:40:45,775 --> 00:40:47,211
What's up with her?

463
00:40:47,244 --> 00:40:48,979
She saw you with Chelsea!

464
00:40:49,012 --> 00:40:51,515
That was nothing.
I just helped her!

465
00:40:51,547 --> 00:40:53,816
Well getting her to kiss you
isn't nothing!

466
00:40:53,849 --> 00:40:55,485
It's not my fault.
I didn't do anything!

467
00:40:55,518 --> 00:40:57,687
You know Chelsea hates Maddy?
- Says who?

468
00:40:57,721 --> 00:41:00,123
Don't you get it? She'll do any
thing to have a go at Maddy.

469
00:41:00,155 --> 00:41:01,925
No she wouldn't,
she's not like that at all.

470
00:41:08,697 --> 00:41:12,603
I don't care about Maddy.
I think Chelsea really likes me.

471
00:41:12,635 --> 00:41:15,038
Yeah, Chelsea really likes
you...Not!

472
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:17,840
It's different now!
She knows me.

473
00:41:17,873 --> 00:41:18,942
Yeah right, sure.

474
00:41:21,077 --> 00:41:24,581
Nice, Harry. Nice and strong
through those shoulders sets.

475
00:41:24,614 --> 00:41:28,519
Josh and Maddy didn't seem to be
getting on. Did you notice?

476
00:41:28,552 --> 00:41:31,188
Can't say that I did.

477
00:41:31,221 --> 00:41:34,257
Yeah, nice, Josh, that's it.

478
00:41:34,291 --> 00:41:35,993
Keep that sustained.

479
00:41:45,969 --> 00:41:47,905
Have you got the invite?

480
00:41:47,938 --> 00:41:49,907
Yes, I have it.
- Mum? Dad?

481
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:51,842
You'll be coming down today
won't you?

482
00:41:51,875 --> 00:41:53,744
Of course we will darling

483
00:41:53,777 --> 00:41:55,244
but we have to go to your
father's business lunch first.

484
00:41:55,277 --> 00:41:56,312
You'll come down straight after?

485
00:41:56,346 --> 00:41:57,914
Yes, we'll try.

486
00:42:06,121 --> 00:42:07,857
They're not coming are they?

487
00:42:16,666 --> 00:42:18,068

490
00:43:17,893 --> 00:43:19,662
Well done, Kayla.

Go, Erin! GFG GFG.
- Go, Erin! GFG, Erin! GFG, GFG.

C'mon, Erin, keep it tight!

494
00:43:50,293 --> 00:43:51,795
Show it off.

495
00:44:10,313 --> 00:44:14,251
That was so good.
-Well done.

496
00:44:14,284 --> 00:44:18,021
Alright, Maddy?
- C'mon, Maddy! GFG!

497
00:44:18,054 --> 00:44:19,456
C'mon, Maddy! Keep it tight!
- GFG!

498
00:44:19,489 --> 00:44:21,791
No.

499
00:45:04,833 --> 00:45:06,803
Well done, Maddy!

500
00:45:11,306 --> 00:45:14,110
Congratulations gymnasts.
Well done!

501
00:45:14,143 --> 00:45:15,712
[Audience applause]

502
00:45:33,496 --> 00:45:37,200
Thank you, gymnasts.
We have with us today
a special guest.

503
00:45:37,233 --> 00:45:41,104
Tom Johansson from the National
Selectors Committee.

504
00:45:41,137 --> 00:45:42,905
Let's welcome Tom.

505
00:45:42,938 --> 00:45:44,306
[Applause]

506
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:46,108
Thank you.

507
00:45:46,141 --> 00:45:48,511
What a fantastic competition
that's been here today!

508
00:45:48,545 --> 00:45:51,047
With some very talented
gymnasts.

509
00:45:51,079 --> 00:45:53,449
That brings me to the reason
why I'm here.

510
00:45:53,483 --> 00:45:56,853
The national selectors
will be appointing
the winning gymnast

511
00:45:56,885 --> 00:46:00,190
in the next competition straight
into the national squad.

512
00:46:00,222 --> 00:46:02,925
Also, I have some good news
for the judges

513
00:46:02,958 --> 00:46:06,362
and, in particular, your very
own Sally Peterson.

514
00:46:06,396 --> 00:46:08,899
Come forward, Sally.

515
00:46:08,931 --> 00:46:10,933
There's a vacancy on the
International judges panel.

516
00:46:10,967 --> 00:46:13,503
And I'm pleased to announce
Sally has been nominated

517
00:46:13,536 --> 00:46:15,204
to be our representative.

518
00:46:15,237 --> 00:46:18,107
So, congratulations Sally,
and thank you everyone.

519
00:46:18,141 --> 00:46:22,945
[Applause]
See you in round 3.

520
00:46:22,978 --> 00:46:25,181
Sally, can I speak to you
afterwards if that's OK?

521
00:46:25,215 --> 00:46:26,817
Sure.

522
00:46:30,586 --> 00:46:35,592
That little witch Maddy.
She isn't that good at all.

523
00:46:35,625 --> 00:46:39,262
Yeah. That little witch Maddy,
she isn't even that good at all.

524
00:46:39,295 --> 00:46:43,967
God!
- What?

525
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,271
Makes me so mad! Maddy won that
medal fair and square!

526
00:46:48,304 --> 00:46:50,307
Saints? As if!

527
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:53,911
You know? They do look like
winners though.

528
00:46:59,014 --> 00:47:01,451
I think it's time we had
an extreme make over.

529
00:47:01,483 --> 00:47:02,885
What?

530
00:47:02,918 --> 00:47:06,889
C'mon, let's go find Beverley!

531
00:47:06,922 --> 00:47:09,925
So, to get endorsement
into the national committee

532
00:47:09,958 --> 00:47:13,230
three members will
assess your judging

533
00:47:13,262 --> 00:47:15,598
They judge you and gymnasts
and compare scores.

534
00:47:15,632 --> 00:47:19,369
Yes and I have to be within .2
of their score to be nominated.

535
00:47:19,402 --> 00:47:21,938
Correct. But there is one
other problem.

536
00:47:21,971 --> 00:47:23,306
Problem? What's that?

537
00:47:23,338 --> 00:47:25,307
Someone's lodged a complaint
against you.

538
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:28,510
A complaint? What about?

539
00:47:28,543 --> 00:47:29,913
Bias judging.

540
00:47:29,945 --> 00:47:33,282
What!
I can't believe it!

541
00:47:33,315 --> 00:47:35,551
We can't endorse your nomination
whilst this complaint is lodged.

542
00:47:35,585 --> 00:47:37,320
Who lodged it?

543
00:47:37,353 --> 00:47:39,155
You know I can't say
until the hearings been set.

544
00:47:39,188 --> 00:47:41,224
I can't imagine who
would do this?

545
00:47:41,257 --> 00:47:44,461
Can you tell me who?
- You know I can't tell you.

546
00:47:44,494 --> 00:47:46,528
You know those are
the procedures.

547
00:47:46,561 --> 00:47:52,301
However, it would be better
if it just went away.

548
00:47:52,335 --> 00:47:54,605
Tom, this is my whole future.

549
00:48:01,344 --> 00:48:05,382
There's Beverley and
who's the other coach?

550
00:48:05,414 --> 00:48:07,083
Kate Jones isn't it?

551
00:48:07,115 --> 00:48:09,485
Didn't Kate and you used to be
good friends?

552
00:48:09,518 --> 00:48:11,453
You could say that.

553
00:48:11,487 --> 00:48:16,526
Pity you're not all good friends
now isn't it?

554
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:19,062
Kate Jones!
I want to speak to you!

555
00:48:20,295 --> 00:48:22,431
Sally?

556
00:48:22,465 --> 00:48:24,501
You made a complaint against
me of my judging

557
00:48:24,534 --> 00:48:27,202
of your precious little
protege Maddy Cornell?

558
00:48:27,235 --> 00:48:28,938
Sally. I didn't.

559
00:48:28,972 --> 00:48:30,707
But I should.

560
00:48:30,739 --> 00:48:33,008
Kate. Don't lie to me now.

561
00:48:33,041 --> 00:48:36,712
You lied when I had the
accident in the gym.

562
00:48:36,746 --> 00:48:39,081
Don't lie to me again.

563
00:48:39,114 --> 00:48:41,017
I didn't.

564
00:48:43,418 --> 00:48:45,020
It wasn't my fault.

565
00:48:45,054 --> 00:48:48,057
Yes it was.
You pushed me.

566
00:48:53,628 --> 00:48:57,300
The pit's been emptied so be
careful not to go near it, OK?

567
00:49:01,269 --> 00:49:03,340
I had my hand on your shoulder.

568
00:49:03,373 --> 00:49:07,376
You were holding on to me.

569
00:49:07,409 --> 00:49:09,445
We were having such good fun.

570
00:49:09,478 --> 00:49:11,413
No you won't.

571
00:49:11,447 --> 00:49:14,351
Then you fell.

572
00:49:14,384 --> 00:49:16,219
You slipped.

573
00:49:16,251 --> 00:49:21,690
I don't know.
I just can't remember.

574
00:49:21,724 --> 00:49:23,159
You may not remember
but I sure do.

575
00:49:23,192 --> 00:49:25,295
Because I live with it
every day.

576
00:49:28,731 --> 00:49:32,068
If you try and destroy my future
I'll make sure your little

577
00:49:32,101 --> 00:49:34,704
protege's future is
destroyed too!

578
00:49:34,737 --> 00:49:36,373
What?

579
00:49:36,405 --> 00:49:39,208
You wouldn't.

580
00:49:39,242 --> 00:49:43,113
Not to Maddy?
- Just try me!

581
00:49:45,313 --> 00:49:47,282
Kate?

582
00:49:47,315 --> 00:49:49,752
What was that all about?

583
00:49:54,289 --> 00:49:56,525
It's the accident.
She still blames me.

584
00:49:56,559 --> 00:49:58,327
I think I pushed her.

585
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:02,231
Shh. You said you couldn't
remember what happened.

586
00:50:02,264 --> 00:50:05,667
I know. I can't but Sally does.

587
00:50:05,701 --> 00:50:08,538
She said I pushed her.

588
00:50:08,570 --> 00:50:12,442
Oh, Kate. Shh.

589
00:50:12,474 --> 00:50:17,447
I'm sure if you had,
you would have remembered.

590
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:19,782
I don't know. I just...
I don't know!

591
00:50:22,751 --> 00:50:26,056
Blow. That's a good girl.
- [Crying Giggle]

592
00:50:29,257 --> 00:50:31,593
Try not to think about Sally.

593
00:50:31,626 --> 00:50:36,166
You should be thrilled with
how the girls went today.

594
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:38,501
Especially Maddy.

595
00:50:38,534 --> 00:50:41,503
Two silvers, not bad, hey?
- Yeah and the winner

596
00:50:41,536 --> 00:50:45,574
goes straight into the
national team! Woo-hoo!

597
00:50:45,608 --> 00:50:49,846
I think that's reserved
for Chelsea.

598
00:50:49,878 --> 00:50:52,848
I don't know, if you take
Sally's bias out of it.

599
00:50:52,882 --> 00:50:55,652
It's a very close thing.

600
00:50:55,684 --> 00:50:58,221
Do you think?
- Aha.

601
00:50:58,253 --> 00:51:00,255
Don't give up on her now.

602
00:51:00,289 --> 00:51:03,159
Anything could happen.

603
00:51:03,192 --> 00:51:05,494
Yeah, I guess.

604
00:51:07,329 --> 00:51:11,768
Something troubling Maddy
though.

605
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:14,304
I don't know.
I can't quite pinpoint it.

606
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:19,142
Good, Kayla.

607
00:51:21,911 --> 00:51:25,882
OK. That's it for today girls.

608
00:51:25,914 --> 00:51:27,851
Really good today girls.

609
00:51:27,884 --> 00:51:29,318
Really, really good.

610
00:51:29,351 --> 00:51:32,288
Now, home and relax,
you deserve it.

611
00:51:34,690 --> 00:51:37,661
Hey, Maddy?

612
00:51:48,371 --> 00:51:50,673
I think it's time we shared
the joy of Maddy's puppy love

613
00:51:50,706 --> 00:51:51,841
with the whole school.

614
00:51:51,873 --> 00:51:53,609
Maddy has a puppy?
I love puppies!

615
00:51:53,643 --> 00:51:55,378
No. Catherine. Beccy.

616
00:51:55,411 --> 00:51:57,480
Same as last time,
we'll get all the year 7's

617
00:51:57,512 --> 00:51:59,181
to watch Maddy's face
when I kiss Josh.

618
00:51:59,215 --> 00:52:01,151
But? Haven't we done enough
to her?

619
00:52:01,184 --> 00:52:03,553
Beccy. The next comp winner will
get into the national squad

620
00:52:03,585 --> 00:52:05,487
do you think I'm gonna give
her a chance at that?

621
00:52:05,521 --> 00:52:08,391
But!
- Now!

622
00:52:08,423 --> 00:52:10,527
What about the puppy?

623
00:52:14,829 --> 00:52:18,201
Maddy wait up. Are you OK?

624
00:52:18,233 --> 00:52:19,635
Yeah, I'm fine.

625
00:52:19,668 --> 00:52:21,436
You've been acting so funny
lately.

626
00:52:21,469 --> 00:52:23,505
I thought winning the silver
would snap you out of it.

627
00:52:23,539 --> 00:52:25,708
I've just had other things
on my mind.

628
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:28,878
If you don't want me around
I'll go hang with Chelsea.

629
00:52:28,911 --> 00:52:30,346
Fine. You do that.

630
00:52:30,378 --> 00:52:32,449
[Inaudible chatter]

631
00:52:38,788 --> 00:52:41,458
[Student laughter]

632
00:52:45,827 --> 00:52:47,630
What are you trying to do?

633
00:52:47,663 --> 00:52:50,934
Nothing that concerns you but
you played your part well!

634
00:52:50,967 --> 00:52:53,635
I didn't do anything!
I thought we were friends?

635
00:52:53,668 --> 00:52:56,905
You and me? I don't think so.
I'm not desperate!

636
00:52:56,938 --> 00:52:59,708
You just used me to hurt Maddy?
- You're the sucker!

637
00:52:59,742 --> 00:53:02,245
I bet you set this up as well.
All just to get at Maddy?

638
00:53:02,277 --> 00:53:04,914
What has she ever done to you?
- That's not the point.

639
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:09,751
You are so up yourself Chelsea!
Who'd wanna be with you?

640
00:53:09,784 --> 00:53:12,721
I don't and no one else
would either!

641
00:53:12,755 --> 00:53:14,624
It's no wonder your parents
never want to be with you.

642
00:53:37,545 --> 00:53:38,748
Mum?

643
00:53:40,682 --> 00:53:43,418
Mum? Dad?

644
00:53:43,452 --> 00:53:44,854
Gran?

645
00:53:48,690 --> 00:53:51,327
Mum? Dad?

646
00:54:08,911 --> 00:54:10,445
I'm quitting!

647
00:54:10,478 --> 00:54:13,282
You can't do that.

648
00:54:13,315 --> 00:54:16,551
I've worked so hard.

649
00:54:16,585 --> 00:54:20,523
I mean we have done too much
work for you to quit!

650
00:54:20,556 --> 00:54:23,025
The final competition
and the National Squad?

651
00:54:23,059 --> 00:54:24,961
Not now!

652
00:54:24,994 --> 00:54:28,463
Maddy!
- Kate!

653
00:54:28,496 --> 00:54:32,567
Why don't you want her to quit?
Is it for her benefit or yours?

654
00:54:32,601 --> 00:54:35,271
Maddy?

655
00:54:39,007 --> 00:54:40,976
[Knock at door]

656
00:54:44,914 --> 00:54:47,017
Maddy, may I come in?

657
00:55:00,128 --> 00:55:01,697
Wow.

658
00:55:01,731 --> 00:55:04,634
A gold medal?

659
00:55:05,934 --> 00:55:09,038
Look at the inscription.

660
00:55:09,070 --> 00:55:13,409
Equal first place,
Kate Jones Under 12,

661
00:55:13,442 --> 00:55:15,545
National Championships?

662
00:55:16,711 --> 00:55:18,614
Who'd you come equal with?

663
00:55:18,646 --> 00:55:20,449
Sally Peterson.

664
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:24,354
Is she the judge
in the wheelchair?

665
00:55:24,387 --> 00:55:25,955
Yeah, that's right.

666
00:55:25,987 --> 00:55:29,791
We were both heading towards
representing our country.

667
00:55:29,824 --> 00:55:34,396
Then Sally had her accident
and could never compete again.

668
00:55:34,429 --> 00:55:37,466
Out of sympathy to her

669
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:42,137
I decided never
to compete again either.

670
00:55:42,170 --> 00:55:44,573
The girls and I always wondered.

671
00:55:44,606 --> 00:55:47,844
Is that why you didn't want
to coach us?

672
00:55:47,876 --> 00:55:50,880
Yeah. Sort of.

673
00:55:52,581 --> 00:55:55,818
Now. It's your choice
whether you quit or not.

674
00:55:55,851 --> 00:55:59,989
And I have to admit coaching
you has given me

675
00:56:00,021 --> 00:56:02,391
a second chance to see
a dream fulfilled.

676
00:56:02,425 --> 00:56:06,996
But I don't want you to be like
me and make a wrong decision.

677
00:56:07,028 --> 00:56:09,699
Quit for the right reasons.

678
00:56:15,804 --> 00:56:18,039
You know I see you look at
yourself.

679
00:56:18,072 --> 00:56:21,643
I see you feel like you're
not like the other kids.

680
00:56:21,677 --> 00:56:25,981
I'm telling you Maddy.
Your talent, your physique,

681
00:56:26,014 --> 00:56:27,817
most of all your heart

682
00:56:27,849 --> 00:56:30,585
means that you are 10 times
more talented than Chelsea

683
00:56:30,619 --> 00:56:32,655
and all her friends
put together.

684
00:56:32,688 --> 00:56:35,157
Quit if you want to.

685
00:56:35,190 --> 00:56:40,096
But don't be like me and
waste your talent because
of what others think.

686
00:56:44,766 --> 00:56:46,469
What about the medal?

687
00:56:46,501 --> 00:56:47,936
Keep it.

688
00:56:55,945 --> 00:56:57,747
That's right.

689
00:56:59,715 --> 00:57:01,851
Swapping over.

690
00:57:04,219 --> 00:57:07,523
Good. And shoulder stretch.

691
00:57:17,065 --> 00:57:21,737
I think we both should have
a second chance.

692
00:57:32,847 --> 00:57:34,650
Go on then!

693
00:57:41,123 --> 00:57:43,693
Maddy?

694
00:57:43,726 --> 00:57:46,896
Maddy! Maddy, wait up.

695
00:57:46,929 --> 00:57:49,898
I realize I was wrong!
I shouldn't have made fun of you
like that.

696
00:57:52,902 --> 00:57:54,637
What are you doing now, Chelsea?

697
00:57:54,670 --> 00:57:56,137
Still trying to milk more fun
out of it?

698
00:57:56,170 --> 00:57:59,608
No, I was trying to apologize.

699
00:58:01,210 --> 00:58:04,847
Maddy? Sorry about yesterday.
I didn't know!

700
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:07,016
Spare me the details.
I saw what happened.

701
00:58:07,048 --> 00:58:08,284
But I didn't mean to hurt you.
- Well, you did!

702
00:58:08,317 --> 00:58:10,219
And I don't want you
around anymore.

703
00:58:10,251 --> 00:58:12,954
I told Kate and Shane I don't
want you at training either.

704
00:58:12,987 --> 00:58:14,589
But it wasn't my fault!

705
00:58:14,623 --> 00:58:16,525
Maddy?

706
00:58:21,797 --> 00:58:24,800
Maddy? Maddy?

707
00:58:33,775 --> 00:58:35,210
Maddy?

708
00:58:56,065 --> 00:58:57,599
What you doing, buddy?

709
00:58:57,632 --> 00:59:00,168
Ahhh, glutton for more
punishment, eh?

710
00:59:00,202 --> 00:59:03,205
I heard what you said to Chelsea
after her stunt. Good for you!

711
00:59:03,237 --> 00:59:06,074
Doesn't do me any good,
Maddy won't even talk to me.

712
00:59:06,108 --> 00:59:10,246
Come back after training
tonight. I'll talk to her.

713
00:59:10,278 --> 00:59:11,947
OK?

714
00:59:11,981 --> 00:59:13,983
You'd help?
Sure. I'll be back.

715
00:59:54,422 --> 00:59:56,625
Maddy?

716
00:59:56,659 --> 00:59:58,794
Maddy.

717
00:59:58,827 --> 01:00:03,165
Even if you're right you still
have to forgive and move on.

718
01:00:03,197 --> 01:00:05,367
But!

719
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:08,136
Did you know he gave Chelsea
a serve after you left?

720
01:00:08,170 --> 01:00:12,375
No. Erin and Kayla said
something, but I didn't listen.

721
01:00:12,407 --> 01:00:17,813
Well, from what they told me
that boy deserves a gold medal.

722
01:00:30,425 --> 01:00:35,831
Um. Do you want to walk me home?
- Sure!

723
01:00:45,708 --> 01:00:48,244
Forgive and move on,
or you just hurt yourself.

724
01:00:48,277 --> 01:00:52,280
Let me guess.
Good advice for me and Sally.

725
01:00:52,313 --> 01:00:54,082
It would be good for the
both of you.

726
01:00:54,115 --> 01:00:56,384
I mean, for what it's worth.

727
01:00:56,418 --> 01:01:00,222
Well, whatever happens next
comp, I'll try and patch things
up.

728
01:01:00,255 --> 01:01:05,027
It won't solve this complaint
against her though.

729
01:01:05,059 --> 01:01:07,362
What do you mean?

730
01:01:07,396 --> 01:01:11,734
She blames me for a complaint
lodged against her.

731
01:01:11,766 --> 01:01:13,902
That's what our
argument was about.

732
01:01:13,936 --> 01:01:16,238
I thought you said it was
about the accident.

733
01:01:16,271 --> 01:01:18,841
Well yeah that too.

734
01:01:18,873 --> 01:01:20,375
But it was the complaint
that started it off.

735
01:01:20,409 --> 01:01:23,445
Oh dear.

736
01:01:23,478 --> 01:01:25,246
Don't you worry about it.

737
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:28,718
I'll just have to sort it out
with her anyway.

738
01:01:28,751 --> 01:01:34,490
I think I could do with a dose
of that advice myself.

739
01:01:34,523 --> 01:01:40,296
You lodged the complaint?
- Shh! I saw what she was

740
01:01:40,329 --> 01:01:42,898
doing to Maddy
and it wasn't fair.

741
01:01:42,931 --> 01:01:45,333
And I couldn't stand by
and do nothing.

742
01:01:45,367 --> 01:01:50,306
Oh Beverley! This whole time
she's been blaming me
and it was you!

743
01:01:50,338 --> 01:01:51,907
Oh, I'm sorry Kate.

744
01:01:51,940 --> 01:01:53,809
I thought
I was doing the right thing.

745
01:01:57,512 --> 01:02:02,117
It's fine.
- Really?

746
01:02:02,150 --> 01:02:05,987
I sort of didn't mind her harsh
judging of Maddy.

747
01:02:08,257 --> 01:02:11,360
I mean, I hated it and it made
me really angry but

748
01:02:11,393 --> 01:02:13,496
it was actually very
motivating.

749
01:02:13,528 --> 01:02:18,333
Pushed me & Maddy beyond what
I thought we were capable of.

750
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:21,403
A silver lining to a dark cloud.

751
01:02:21,436 --> 01:02:26,041
Yeah, you're lucky.
- [Chuckle]

752
01:02:26,074 --> 01:02:29,110
What are we gonna do?

753
01:02:29,143 --> 01:02:33,849
I'll make things right.

754
01:03:23,364 --> 01:03:29,537
One... two... three...
and turn.

755
01:03:29,570 --> 01:03:31,105
Beautiful.

756
01:03:31,139 --> 01:03:34,510
One... two...

757
01:03:34,543 --> 01:03:38,114
And turn back. Yes...

758
01:03:43,418 --> 01:03:46,155
[Phone ringing]

759
01:03:49,291 --> 01:03:51,227
- Hello.
- Shane, it's me.

760
01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:55,231
- Kate.
- I've been doing some
thinking about the girls.

761
01:03:55,264 --> 01:03:58,567
And there's only 3 weeks until
the next comp.

762
01:03:58,599 --> 01:04:01,402
And I want to talk to you
about them but not in front of
them.

763
01:04:01,436 --> 01:04:04,974
- OK... Where?

764
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:07,076
I don't mind.

765
01:04:07,108 --> 01:04:11,480
Hmm. OK but only
if I pick the place!

766
01:04:11,512 --> 01:04:13,114
Great.

767
01:04:23,958 --> 01:04:26,661
This is cozy.
- I take it you approve?

768
01:04:26,695 --> 01:04:30,298
Well, I'm not adverse to
intimacy and class.

769
01:04:30,331 --> 01:04:34,002
I can see that.
You look fantastic!

770
01:04:34,036 --> 01:04:35,471
Thank you.

771
01:04:39,173 --> 01:04:45,280
How can we improve the girls
chances at the next comp?

772
01:04:45,313 --> 01:04:46,547
I thought that's what we
were training for?

773
01:04:46,581 --> 01:04:49,285
Well, yeah of course it is,
but now

774
01:04:49,318 --> 01:04:51,420
I can actually
see them winning.

775
01:04:51,452 --> 01:04:53,389
OK. Um.

776
01:04:53,422 --> 01:04:57,592
Are they all doing extra
skills on the apparatus?

777
01:04:57,626 --> 01:04:59,061
Well yeah, as many as they
can but

778
01:04:59,094 --> 01:05:01,262
Maddy's struggling with
her kips move.

779
01:05:01,295 --> 01:05:03,097
Erin with her run up
for vault.

780
01:05:03,130 --> 01:05:05,500
Kayla with footwork on beam.

781
01:05:05,534 --> 01:05:09,471
Well, Maddy could do a layout
backsault with a full twist.

782
01:05:09,503 --> 01:05:11,472
for an extra .5 on her
floor routine?

783
01:05:11,505 --> 01:05:14,275
True, but she sprained her ankle
and was out for a week.

784
01:05:14,309 --> 01:05:16,711
the last time
she attempted that.

785
01:05:16,744 --> 01:05:19,414
- Hmm.
- Maddy's kips.

786
01:05:19,447 --> 01:05:21,650
Erin's vault and
Kayla's footwork?

787
01:05:22,717 --> 01:05:26,621
I've got an idea.

788
01:05:28,123 --> 01:05:32,427
[Clears throat]

789
01:05:32,460 --> 01:05:35,563
Hey, yeah, it's Shane, yeah,
long time.

790
01:05:35,597 --> 01:05:40,236
I know this is short notice
but I was wondering if...

791
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:51,512
Alright. It's set.

792
01:05:51,545 --> 01:05:53,748
What's set?
- Uh, no, no, no, no, no...

793
01:05:53,782 --> 01:05:55,351
That's a surprise!

794
01:05:55,384 --> 01:05:58,286
Be at the
athletic stadium at 7:00 am.

795
01:05:58,320 --> 01:06:00,655
with the girls, if you dare.

796
01:06:00,688 --> 01:06:04,393
Now, let's talk about you
for a change.

797
01:06:27,548 --> 01:06:30,786
[Chatter]

798
01:06:30,818 --> 01:06:35,324
The beam?
- Excuse me! The beam is--

799
01:06:35,356 --> 01:06:37,159
Is that right?
- Yes!

800
01:06:37,192 --> 01:06:40,262
And men don't do it because--
- I bet you I could!

801
01:06:40,295 --> 01:06:43,432
Come on. You'll fall off!
- Let me show you.

802
01:06:50,672 --> 01:06:53,041
Oh my god,
this is so embarrassing.

803
01:06:54,342 --> 01:06:57,179
There's people watching!

804
01:06:57,211 --> 01:06:59,547
No. Lengthen.

805
01:06:59,581 --> 01:07:00,649
Up!

806
01:07:00,681 --> 01:07:04,452
Very nice.
- Dismount?

807
01:07:04,485 --> 01:07:08,489
Ohh, very good--and extend.

808
01:07:08,523 --> 01:07:11,293
Well done.

809
01:07:12,793 --> 01:07:16,264
They liked you.
- Yeah? What'd you think?

810
01:07:16,297 --> 01:07:19,667
Um. I'd give you another
six years!

811
01:07:47,161 --> 01:07:48,763
Kate?
What are we doing here?

812
01:07:48,797 --> 01:07:52,101
[Phone rings]
I'm about to find out.

813
01:07:56,204 --> 01:07:59,740
- Kate, are you there?
- Yes. We're here.

814
01:07:59,773 --> 01:08:02,777
What's happening?
- OK. If you look around

815
01:08:02,811 --> 01:08:05,347
there should be an athlete
waving toward you?

816
01:08:05,380 --> 01:08:09,617
I see her.
-  Put me on speaker.

817
01:08:09,650 --> 01:08:13,454
Girls, this is Tamsyn Lewis.
Australian champion runner

818
01:08:13,487 --> 01:08:15,823
who's been to the Olympics
and World Championships!

819
01:08:15,856 --> 01:08:18,627
This is especially for you,
Erin!

820
01:08:18,659 --> 01:08:20,528
Fantastic! That's great!

821
01:08:20,561 --> 01:08:24,599
- Hi, girls!
You must be Kate?

822
01:08:24,632 --> 01:08:26,601
Yes.
I've spoken to Shane.

823
01:08:26,635 --> 01:08:29,838
And he wants me to help you
with speed and acceleration.

824
01:08:29,871 --> 01:08:34,243
Let's go and work on
some technique.

825
01:08:34,275 --> 01:08:40,849
Now sprinters focus on using
their arms to generate speed.

826
01:08:40,881 --> 01:08:43,152
They pump their arms up and down

827
01:08:43,185 --> 01:08:47,456
and they focus on driving out.

828
01:08:47,488 --> 01:08:52,360
On your marks.
Set. Go!

829
01:08:52,394 --> 01:08:54,797
Let's go again, remembering
what I've taught you.

830
01:09:07,975 --> 01:09:10,211
Erin, that's really good.

831
01:09:10,244 --> 01:09:13,615
We're gonna have to move your
cone back, you're much faster!

832
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:20,455
Set.

833
01:09:20,488 --> 01:09:22,958
Kate, they're doing very well.

834
01:09:22,990 --> 01:09:27,630
I reckon there's one more
thing that would help.
Resistance training.

835
01:09:43,478 --> 01:09:46,782
[Phone ringing]
- Shane?

836
01:09:46,814 --> 01:09:48,849
Kate?

837
01:09:48,882 --> 01:09:52,720
Now for Maddy's kip. Tomorrow
meet me at my mate's warehouse.

838
01:09:52,753 --> 01:09:55,356
What are we doing here?

839
01:09:55,390 --> 01:09:59,595
Aww. Box off, box on.

840
01:10:00,895 --> 01:10:03,599
Who does he think he is?

841
01:10:03,631 --> 01:10:06,601
Mr. Miyagi I think?

842
01:10:06,635 --> 01:10:09,371
Who?

843
01:10:09,404 --> 01:10:10,706
Mr Ho to you!

844
01:10:10,738 --> 01:10:12,240
Who?

845
01:10:12,274 --> 01:10:14,943
[Sigh] Girls.
This is Dean Lukin!

846
01:10:14,975 --> 01:10:20,248
Australia's only Gold medalist
in the Olympics
for weight lifting!

847
01:10:20,282 --> 01:10:22,518
Cool! Do we get to do some
weight lifting?

848
01:10:28,023 --> 01:10:31,393
Shane's explained we need to do
a little bit of weight training.

849
01:10:31,426 --> 01:10:35,530
So, what we're gonna do,
is lift some of these cartons.

850
01:10:40,801 --> 01:10:44,672
No! Straight arms.

851
01:11:01,588 --> 01:11:03,324
This is gonna be hard.

852
01:11:03,358 --> 01:11:06,862
After a week?
More than you know.

853
01:11:14,368 --> 01:11:19,440
Oh, Maddy?
Straight arms. GFG!

854
01:11:29,684 --> 01:11:32,020
OK, girls, that should
about do it!

855
01:11:32,052 --> 01:11:35,090
Alright. To the gym.
Let's put it to the test.

856
01:11:35,122 --> 01:11:39,660
What? Now?
- No time like the present.

857
01:11:39,694 --> 01:11:44,032
OK, Maddy.
Let's see your kip.

858
01:11:44,064 --> 01:11:47,535
Now?
My arms are dropping off.

859
01:11:47,569 --> 01:11:49,104
Yes. Now!

860
01:11:49,136 --> 01:11:50,604
Kate?

861
01:11:50,637 --> 01:11:52,507
You heard the man.
Let's go.

862
01:12:04,485 --> 01:12:06,520
Maddy, I'm serious.

863
01:12:06,554 --> 01:12:11,659
One swing, then into kip, ok?

864
01:12:27,108 --> 01:12:30,912
Wow!
- Did you see that. [Laughter].

865
01:12:30,944 --> 01:12:33,481
Great, Maddy!

866
01:12:33,515 --> 01:12:37,052
This time, try again and connect
your handstand.

867
01:12:49,197 --> 01:12:51,900
Wow! That was amazing!
- That was so amazing!

868
01:12:51,932 --> 01:12:53,835
Nice one, Shane!

869
01:12:53,868 --> 01:12:58,974
OK. Now for my next miracle,
Kayla's footwork. [Whispers]

870
01:12:59,006 --> 01:13:02,076
Where? Where tell us! C'mon!

871
01:13:02,109 --> 01:13:03,878
It's a secret. Not telling!

872
01:13:05,646 --> 01:13:08,384
[Waltz Music]

873
01:13:20,595 --> 01:13:21,963
Now, these are for you.

874
01:13:21,996 --> 01:13:24,533
These are boots.

875
01:13:24,565 --> 01:13:27,601
They have solid toes too?

876
01:13:27,635 --> 01:13:31,573
They're called steel caps,
and trust me, you'll need them.

877
01:13:34,509 --> 01:13:39,014
So, this is Kayla our troubled
footwork gymnast.

878
01:13:39,046 --> 01:13:43,751
Work your magic! Hopefully
not too many injuries.

879
01:13:43,784 --> 01:13:46,054
I'm sure we'll be fine.
-[laughs]

880
01:13:50,992 --> 01:13:55,697
He's got boots on as well?
- Yes. For his protection!

881
01:13:55,729 --> 01:13:56,931
Good luck, Chris.

882
01:14:04,204 --> 01:14:08,577
Sorry... oh...
- It's OK.

883
01:14:08,609 --> 01:14:12,480
Sorry! Oops! Ahh.
- Over this way. And....

884
01:14:12,514 --> 01:14:16,518
And again.
That's OK start again. Sorry!

885
01:14:25,092 --> 01:14:27,628
Wait! Can you like, slow down?

886
01:15:11,905 --> 01:15:14,710
Well, that's the best I can do
with them in 3 weeks.

887
01:15:16,310 --> 01:15:21,015
I think you are a regular little
miracle worker.

888
01:15:23,083 --> 01:15:26,755
I... I...
I do have one more surprise.

889
01:15:26,787 --> 01:15:30,224
I thought Maddy needed something
that stood out music wise

890
01:15:30,257 --> 01:15:32,661
for her floor routine.
So I had this made for you.

891
01:15:32,694 --> 01:15:35,197
Oh Maddy really.

892
01:15:38,166 --> 01:15:39,835
[Floor routine music]

893
01:15:50,845 --> 01:15:54,315
Wow! What's fantastic!
Can you play that again?

894
01:15:55,750 --> 01:15:58,153
[Music is restarted]

895
01:16:09,930 --> 01:16:12,032
This goes perfectly with her
routine!

896
01:16:12,065 --> 01:16:14,269
I'll get her used
to it in the morning.
Just a few little changes.

897
01:16:15,903 --> 01:16:19,039
She's gonna love this!

898
01:16:19,073 --> 01:16:22,844
Did I say only 1 more surprise?

899
01:16:22,877 --> 01:16:25,614
I was really hoping for two.

900
01:16:59,247 --> 01:17:03,851
Chelsea,
don't get your hopes up.
They're really busy today.

901
01:17:32,846 --> 01:17:36,917
Girls!
The warm up has started. C'mon!

902
01:17:36,951 --> 01:17:38,987
Off with the tops!
Get into it!

903
01:17:39,020 --> 01:17:41,189
We'll take them off for the
march on, but not before!

904
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:49,430
Ohh. OK.
We'll wait for the march on.

905
01:17:49,463 --> 01:17:52,033
But we still have to
do warm up.

906
01:17:52,065 --> 01:17:54,202
Arm swings, c'mon!

907
01:17:54,234 --> 01:17:59,873
Please leave the competition
area, to commence the march on.

908
01:17:59,907 --> 01:18:01,275
and team presentations.

909
01:18:01,309 --> 01:18:02,877
What was all that about?

910
01:18:02,909 --> 01:18:06,213
Well, together with your music.

911
01:18:06,247 --> 01:18:10,118
Let's just say, it's going to be
a very interesting day.

912
01:18:12,420 --> 01:18:17,158
Welcome everyone to the deciding
competition for the
State Championships.

913
01:18:17,190 --> 01:18:20,362
[Marching Music]

914
01:18:22,529 --> 01:18:24,131
Teams competing today are--

915
01:18:24,164 --> 01:18:26,835
Hub.

916
01:18:26,868 --> 01:18:30,105
Aerial.

917
01:18:30,137 --> 01:18:34,074
Dynamic.

918
01:18:34,108 --> 01:18:38,012
Seacliff.

919
01:18:38,045 --> 01:18:41,216
Elizabeth.

920
01:18:41,248 --> 01:18:43,851
Saints.

921
01:18:43,885 --> 01:18:47,055
And Coreega.

922
01:18:48,488 --> 01:18:52,960
Gymnasts to your first
apparatus please.

923
01:20:26,921 --> 01:20:30,192
These two seats free?
- Ah yeah, I think they are.

924
01:20:44,404 --> 01:20:46,506
It looks like Maddy and Chelsea
are going to be the last

925
01:20:46,539 --> 01:20:52,313
to compete on the floor.

926
01:20:52,345 --> 01:20:54,314
The best I can work out is
whoever wins the floor

927
01:20:54,347 --> 01:20:57,519
is gonna win the comp.

928
01:22:01,215 --> 01:22:03,251
[Applause]

929
01:22:07,054 --> 01:22:12,726
Wow! That's the highest score
for a level 6 on the floor!

930
01:22:12,760 --> 01:22:15,463
That's gonna be hard to beat!

931
01:22:15,496 --> 01:22:19,000
Oh no. This is not good.
- What's the matter, Shane?

932
01:22:19,033 --> 01:22:21,302
Hold on a minute.
- Shane?!

933
01:22:21,335 --> 01:22:25,038
Kate! Kate! Kate! Kate!

934
01:22:25,072 --> 01:22:27,475
Maddy's base score won't
give her enough points

935
01:22:27,507 --> 01:22:30,411
to beat Chelsea.
She needs a bonus skill.

936
01:22:30,444 --> 01:22:32,180
What's the score difference?

937
01:22:32,212 --> 01:22:35,082
She needs at least a .5 bonus.

938
01:22:35,115 --> 01:22:40,121
There's not much we can do
about it now.

939
01:22:40,154 --> 01:22:42,757
Do the layout backsault,
with a full twist.

940
01:22:42,789 --> 01:22:44,759
That would give her
the extra point.

941
01:22:44,792 --> 01:22:46,427
That's too hard for her,
Shane!

942
01:22:46,460 --> 01:22:48,128
Chelsea can't even do that!

943
01:22:48,162 --> 01:22:51,666
Kate? I want to do it.

944
01:22:51,698 --> 01:22:56,536
I reckon I can.
I was so close last time.

945
01:22:56,569 --> 01:22:59,073
And I am so much stronger now.

946
01:23:04,045 --> 01:23:05,646
Maddy, are you sure?

947
01:23:07,581 --> 01:23:09,784
You can do it, Maddy.

948
01:23:09,817 --> 01:23:11,286
OK.

949
01:23:14,154 --> 01:23:15,355
Maddy, Maddy.

950
01:23:15,389 --> 01:23:18,393
GFG! GFG, Maddy!

951
01:23:18,426 --> 01:23:20,095
GFG?

Yes! Brilliant Maddy Brilliant!
[Audience cheer]

954
01:25:06,533 --> 01:25:08,902
Is she equal with Chelsea?
- Yep!

955
01:25:08,935 --> 01:25:11,338
It all comes down to Sally's
score now.

956
01:25:13,373 --> 01:25:15,143

What does that X mean?
I haven't seen that before?

960
01:25:40,801 --> 01:25:42,537
It's some sort of error.

the presentations. Tom?

964
01:26:14,835 --> 01:26:18,739
Thank you. Get straight into
it shall we?

965
01:26:18,771 --> 01:26:23,543
In 3rd place, actually we've got
two equal 3rd's today!

966
01:26:23,577 --> 01:26:25,980
From Saints, Catherine Sims.

967

And from Coreega, Erin Bishop!

968
01:26:29,750 --> 01:26:31,653
Well done girls.

969
01:26:35,421 --> 01:26:40,260

score ever achieved for floor

in level 6, plus two gold
medals for floor and bar...

975
01:27:04,885 --> 01:27:06,487
Well done, girls.

976
01:27:13,694 --> 01:27:15,596
As promised,

977
01:27:15,628 --> 01:27:19,934
the winner of today has
automatic inclusion
onto the national squad.

978
01:27:19,966 --> 01:27:23,503
So congratulations Maddy
on winning that place.

01:27:23,537 --> 01:27:28,976
Now I also announce that your
very own Sally Peterson

has a very special
announcement. Tom?

985
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:57,070
Thank you. As I mentioned
before Maddy Cornell
has won her place

986
01:27:57,104 --> 01:28:00,941
onto the squad. I also have
the discretion of adding

987
01:28:00,974 --> 01:28:02,777
an extra gymnast
to the squad as well.

988
01:28:02,810 --> 01:28:07,948
I'm pleased to announce with
an outstanding performance.

989
01:28:07,980 --> 01:28:09,716
all year round.

990
01:28:09,750 --> 01:28:13,453
We would like to add Chelsea
Smith to the squad as well.

- Congratulations, Chelsea!

992

parents and friends.

995
01:28:28,001 --> 01:28:30,671
That concludes today's
competition.

997
01:28:38,412 --> 01:28:40,815
They saw my 8 as a 3!

998
01:28:40,847 --> 01:28:42,649
Oh dear!

999
01:28:53,394 --> 01:28:55,863
Now girls, enough of this
between you two.

1000
01:28:55,895 --> 01:28:59,599
You're going to become team
mates and you're going to
behave like it,

1001
01:28:59,632 --> 01:29:05,672
or I'll make sure you're both
kicked off the team.

1002
01:29:05,706 --> 01:29:09,743
I don't think she has
the authority to do that.

1003
01:29:09,777 --> 01:29:12,579
You and I both know that.
But they don't.

1004
01:29:12,613 --> 01:29:17,051
I'm sorry for being mean to
you and Joshua and all that.

1005
01:29:17,083 --> 01:29:20,421
Sorry for being rude to you.

The national squad!
Both of us!

1008
01:29:33,100 --> 01:29:34,836
Hey kiddo.

1009
01:29:39,872 --> 01:29:42,542
Yeah, here she is. Give it up.

1010
01:29:43,877 --> 01:29:46,714
It was my fault.
- It was my fault.

1011
01:29:46,747 --> 01:29:49,083
No, it was mine.
- It was mine.

1012
01:29:49,115 --> 01:29:51,786
Kate, let me speak first.

1013
01:29:51,819 --> 01:29:55,556
I was the one that made up
that game on the beam.

1014
01:29:55,588 --> 01:29:57,824
And how we were pushing
each other off.

1015
01:29:57,858 --> 01:30:00,795
And I didn't even remember
until the other day that

1016
01:30:00,828 --> 01:30:03,731
my foot slipped.

1017
01:30:03,764 --> 01:30:08,802
I think it has just been easier
to blame somebody else

1018
01:30:08,836 --> 01:30:13,173
than myself and of course that
someone was gonna be you.

1019
01:30:13,207 --> 01:30:17,111
Oh, Sally.
- I'm sorry.

1020
01:30:26,920 --> 01:30:30,158
I won't be needing this.

1021
01:30:32,693 --> 01:30:34,862
Got my own.

1022
01:30:36,195 --> 01:30:40,033
Yeah!

1023
01:30:43,904 --> 01:30:46,808
My little champion!

1024
01:30:47,875 --> 01:30:52,579
C'mon girls, yeah!

1025
01:31:12,932 --> 01:31:16,037
Beautiful
girls. Keep going.

1026
01:31:21,841 --> 01:31:23,944
Keep the routine going.

1027
01:31:25,279 --> 01:31:27,848
Maddy's on the tele.

1028
01:31:27,881 --> 01:31:30,518
Come here you.

1029
01:31:30,551 --> 01:31:32,520
C'mon! Maddy's on the T.V!

1030
01:31:32,552 --> 01:31:35,855
We move to the final rotation.
I can see Maddy Cornell

1031
01:31:35,889 --> 01:31:37,591
just waiting to be introduced.

1032
01:31:37,623 --> 01:31:42,729
Representing Australia,
Maddy Cornell!

1033
01:31:42,762 --> 01:31:45,966
Maddy has an amazing story.
After her first regional

1034
01:31:45,998 --> 01:31:48,735
state championships
a short time ago,

1035
01:31:48,769 --> 01:31:51,838
she's now at the world
