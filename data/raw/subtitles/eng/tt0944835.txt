1
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:54,464
Please let me go home.
Please, I'm not who you think I am.

2
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:57,087
I'm really not who you think I am.

3
00:00:57,975 --> 00:01:00,057
Please. Please.
I'm not a spy.

4
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:01,763
- You are a spy.
- I'm not a spy.

5
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:05,062
- Please let me go home.
- Try again.

6
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:06,938
I am not a spy.
I am a businesswoman.

7
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:10,067
I work for Rink Petroleum and Gas.

8
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:12,649
Please call them.
I work for Rink Petroleum.

9
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:16,907
You are here to sabotage
our nuclear ambitions. Yes?

10
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,989
I am not a spy!
I am not a spy!

11
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,097
- Try again.
- I am not a spy.

12
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:45,681
- You are a spy.
- I am not a spy.

13
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:47,187
Don't lie to me!

14
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:58,324
I am not a spy.

15
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:05,035
<i>It is through the grace and munificence
of our glorious Dear Leader</i>

16
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:08,830
<i>that the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea</i>

17
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:12,588
<i>has pardoned the American imperialist</i>

18
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:16,842
<i>for her hostile acts
against our socialist nation.</i>

19
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:20,550
Keep your head down. Don't say
anything till we make the swap.

20
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:24,342
In case Kim Jong II here
changes his mind.

21
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:40,319
Exchange.

22
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:42,571
Right face!

23
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:47,913
Right face!

24
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:50,537
I don't understand.

25
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:52,953
You don't understand what?

26
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,624
All the rules say to leave me,
that one life

27
00:02:57,803 --> 00:03:00,545
is not worth blowing operational cover.

28
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:01,928
You got that right.

29
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:06,100
If we have to lose someone
for the greater good, we will.

30
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:07,304
So why did you do it?

31
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:11,309
Well, I didn't do it.

32
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:14,062
He did.

33
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:18,271
Once he found out where you were,
there was no stopping him.

34
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:23,025
He petitioned the Senate,
the State Department.

35
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:26,240
We didn't need the publicity
so I figured we better do something

36
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:29,953
or he's gonna invade this goddamn
rice-paddy republic himself.

37
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,508
You okay?

38
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:52,095
Yeah.

39
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:37,895
Hey.

40
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:41,858
- Good morning.
- Happy anniversary.

41
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:46,073
You want me to make you breakfast?

42
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:48,656
How about pancakes?

43
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,786
Your cooking?

44
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:52,947
You're joking.
You like my cooking.

45
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,117
Germans don't joke.

46
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,245
Burt likes my cooking.

47
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:07,341
Get your bugs off the table.

48
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:09,598
- They're spiders.
- They're bugs.

49
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:12,638
- They're spiders.
- They're bugs.

50
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:21,610
<i>Fold the next layer back
as you did the two before it.</i>

51
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:25,364
<i>Turn the napkin over.
Fold both sides back,</i>

52
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:28,367
<i>and over one another
about a third of the way.</i>

53
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:33,872
<i>Check for symmetry
and press the fold down well.</i>

54
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:36,158
Are you doing this on company time?

55
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:39,999
<i>- And insert your favorite silverware...
- It's my anniversary.</i>

56
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:43,507
And I want it to be perfect.

57
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:46,885
But that is not sexy.

58
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:49,758
No, but it is utilitarian.

59
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:52,094
And utilitarian is the new sexy.

60
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:55,845
I ran the trace.
First name Usam, last name Utsaev.

61
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,512
- Any verifiable hits?
- One.

62
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:01,024
Hey, Francis, do me a favor
and stick that in the safe till tomorrow.

63
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,276
Mata Hari here's got a big night tonight.

64
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:05,653
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

65
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:08,778
"Sir"?
Do I look like a "sir" to you?

66
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:09,987
From head to toe.

67
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:13,286
I'm surprised he didn't call you
"Your Majesty."

68
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:17,620
I like the ring of that.
I think I'd prefer "Your Majesty."

69
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,501
Was I ever that young?

70
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:23,963
Younger.

71
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,465
Walk me out.

72
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:29,465
How did the Oval Office briefing go?

73
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,470
Oh, you know. The usual.

74
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:34,053
President wants to know
what's happening in Russia

75
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:38,186
the day before it happens. How about you?
I heard that interview went well.

76
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:40,062
Fingers crossed.

77
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,474
You sure about this?

78
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:45,610
You know, once you start pushing paper,
there's no turning back.

79
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:49,147
I had the strangest feeling
when I was out last time.

80
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:51,783
- I was homesick.
- Homesick?

81
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:54,285
- Can't you take something for that?
- Sir! Sir!

82
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:59,036
We got a walk-in.
A defector, 10 minutes ago.

83
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:01,542
- Here?
- I guess he's not buying our cover.

84
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:03,704
- Did you get his bona fides?
- He's Russian.

85
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:05,998
He says he's FSB
but won't give us any more.

86
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,382
- He's a strange guy.
- How's his English?

87
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,676
Passable. Not great.

88
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,714
But if it got down to
the subtleties of English nuance...

89
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:17,510
- Ted, Mike's gonna be waiting for me at home.
- Yeah, and I got a plane to catch.

90
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:18,722
Come on, Salt.

91
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:22,060
No one can sort out a nut job
from the real thing faster than you.

92
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:25,270
- I got 25 minutes.
- I got 26. Let's go.

93
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:34,284
Yeah, okay. Well, we'll decide
when we know more.

94
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,694
- Who called Counterintelligence?
- Not me.

95
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:39,489
Hey, Ted.
We're crashing the party.

96
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:43,493
- Peabody.
- Salt.

97
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,466
Please remove the hood.

98
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:53,173
Microphones are on.

99
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:55,304
Checking levels.

100
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:58,011
Baseline recorded.

101
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,227
Neural scan is up. Ready to go.

102
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,482
- Ev.
- Mm. Yeah.

103
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:11,817
Commencing audio and visual recording.

104
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,952
<i>Testing earpiece.</i>

105
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:27,499
Interview has commenced at 1442.

106
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,306
You're married.

107
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:43,846
A husband must be a distraction

108
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:47,649
for a female intelligence officer.

109
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:49,980
Well, we're here to talk about you.

110
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,311
So, what is your name?

111
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,860
My name is

112
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:59,404
Oleg Vassilyevich Orlov.

113
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:04,825
I have cancer.

114
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:07,039
I'm moved.

115
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:09,329
A defector with cancer.

116
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:13,542
Are you selling secrets for chemo
or are you afraid of dying?

117
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:18,384
If I have gained anything
by damning myself,

118
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:24,644
it is that I no longer
have anything to fear.

119
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:28,269
<i>Russia is also dying.</i>

120
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:31,856
<i>- But unlike me, she's not dead.
- Oleg Vassily Orlov,</i>

121
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:35,739
shows up in 1993
in Novosibirsk Oblast, Siberia.

122
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,191
He was on Victor Barisovsky's
staff there.

123
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:39,651
<i>He checks out as FSB, Ev.</i>

124
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:42,696
Scan says he's truthful on the cancer.

125
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,289
Prior to '93?

126
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:46,578
<i>Russia was once strong, powerful...</i>

127
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:49,244
Nothing.
He doesn't exist.

128
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:53,165
<i>And she will be again
when things have been set back</i>

129
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:55,340
<i>on the correct path.</i>

130
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:58,302
I have somewhere I need to be, Mr. Orlov,

131
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:01,055
so if you wouldn't mind
getting to the point.

132
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:07,437
I came here to tell you a story.

133
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:10,144
I don't like stories.

134
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:13,105
But I'll listen anyway.

135
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,190
In English, please.

136
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:17,155
<i>Others are listening.</i>

137
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:21,076
1975.

138
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:23,779
The Cold War.

139
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,365
<i>In a gymnasium in Grozny,</i>

140
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:29,785
<i>a Soviet Olympic wrestler</i>

141
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:33,501
<i>named Sasha Fyorodovich Chenkov</i>

142
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:35,590
<i>meets for the first time</i>

143
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:40,090
<i>the only female chess grand master
of her era;</i>

144
00:10:41,516 --> 00:10:44,974
<i>Anka Nurekyova.</i>

145
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:48,353
<i>Within a month, they were married.</i>

146
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:51,981
<i>And within a year, a child.</i>

147
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:54,560
<i>One month more,</i>

148
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:58,776
the child was back
in the same hospital,

149
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:00,315
sick with fever.

150
00:11:02,954 --> 00:11:05,240
<i>And within days after that,</i>

151
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:08,999
<i>the child suddenly was dead.</i>

152
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:15,039
<i>Yes, a child was dead.</i>

153
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:19,425
<i>And, yes, a child was buried.</i>

154
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:30,178
<i>But the Chenkov baby was alive</i>

155
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:34,725
<i>and became the property of another man.</i>

156
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:39,271
<i>A master spy who had devised
the greatest plan</i>

157
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:43,783
<i>a Russian patriot could ever invent.</i>

158
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:48,287
<i>A plan to destroy America.</i>

159
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,914
<i>It had all started</i>

160
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:55,044
with an American named
Lee Harvey Oswald.

161
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:59,333
<i>In 1959, he emigrated to Russia.</i>

162
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:02,422
<i>Three years later, he returned home.</i>

163
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:05,384
<i>But the man who came back to America</i>

164
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:11,019
<i>was in fact a Russian spy named Alek.</i>

165
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:14,935
<i>On November 22nd, 1963,</i>

166
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:19,648
<i>Alek became the first success
of the new program</i>

167
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:23,314
<i>and a hero of the Soviet Union.</i>

168
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:26,613
<i>The spymaster was now given the go-ahead</i>

169
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:29,621
<i>to create many more like Alek.</i>

170
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:33,249
<i>Scores of agents, males and females,</i>

171
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:36,035
<i>to be substituted for Americans.</i>

172
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:39,877
<i>I pledge allegiance to the flag...</i>

173
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:42,170
<i>At an abandoned monastery,</i>

174
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:46,133
<i>Chenkov and other boys and girls
learned English</i>

175
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:48,844
<i>long before they learned Russian.</i>

176
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:51,134
Drilled in idiom,

177
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:53,519
<i>idiosyncrasy and</i>

178
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:55,851
ideology.

179
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:02,229
<i>And by methods of rigorous physical
and psychological programming,</i>

180
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:05,490
the spymaster made warriors of iron.

181
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:09,027
<i>Unquestioning and unbreakable.</i>

182
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:11,408
Who crossed first?

183
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,372
Who crossed last?

184
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:22,502
You're killing me, man.

185
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:24,876
When does the good fairy come in?

186
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:27,007
Never.

187
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:28,887
It's a story without hope.

188
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:34,056
Chenkov was matched with the child
of a visiting American family.

189
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:37,814
There was an accident.
The family died.

190
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:40,896
Chenkov was sent to America

191
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:44,483
to live a complete lie

192
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:48,525
and to patiently await the day
to attack from within.

193
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:50,739
Day X.

194
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:55,411
The long-awaited mission is here.

195
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:59,077
Chenkov will travel to New York City

196
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:03,373
to kill the president of Russia

197
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:09,137
at the funeral of
the American vice president.

198
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:14,768
Chenkov is KA 12.

199
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:17,595
- "KA."
- Cold War legend.

200
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:19,605
Highly trained Russian sleeper agents

201
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:23,644
inserted into American society
to sabotage and assassinate.

202
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:26,779
Supposedly they'd wait years to strike.
Decades, even.

203
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:29,816
Mm. Supposedly.

204
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:33,031
- What's the matter Ted? You don't believe in moles?
- I believe in moles, all right.

205
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:34,537
Just not the bogeyman.

206
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,665
Especially if the plan is
to kill their own president.

207
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,746
This guy's selling smoke.

208
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:41,832
Wrap it up, Ev.

209
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:47,296
<i>So a Russian agent is going to kill
the Russian president? Is that it?</i>

210
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:50,006
Mm-hm. Okay.

211
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:52,422
Thank you very much.

212
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:56,184
And what would you like
in return for that information?

213
00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:59,061
I simply wish to help you do

214
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:01,644
what you need to do.

215
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:06,109
You're good.

216
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:10,990
The KA program is brilliant bullshit.

217
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:14,194
But I'm officially off duty,

218
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,993
so you can tell the rest of your
little story to one of my colleagues.

219
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:20,249
- Salt.
- Yes?

220
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:24,746
The name of the Russian agent is Salt.

221
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:27,374
Evelyn Salt.

222
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:32,716
My name is Evelyn Salt.

223
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,015
Then you are a Russian spy.

224
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:38,768
<i>Truthful.</i>

225
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:44,725
So far the FMRI scan registers truthful
on everything he's said.

226
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:49,612
Ted?

227
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:57,908
Call Protective Services,
make sure they find my husband.

228
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:00,744
- I need to get to the phone.
- Not after the neural scan.

229
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:03,705
I can beat that thing
five times out of six.

230
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,836
I am trained to, and so is he.

231
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:08,631
I need my phone.
I need to call my husband.

232
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:11,376
- Let me call my husband.
- Let me see it.

233
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,973
There's a reason he mentioned
my wedding ring, Ted.

234
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:19,930
They don't just blow up their cover

235
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:22,595
they blow up their whole cover life.
You know that.

236
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:25,389
- Do you remember Henley's wife?
- Yes, I do.

237
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,058
Speaker.

238
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:31,024
<i>Please leave a message after the tone.
Thanks. Bye.</i>

239
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,906
Honey, it's me. Please call me
as soon as you get this.

240
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:36,112
Okay, sweetheart?
As soon as you get this.

241
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:38,619
Godspeed, Comrade Chenkov.

242
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:43,783
Someone interrogate that piece of shit.
Someone who enjoys getting answers.

243
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,456
Look, Ev, try to stay calm.

244
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:50,419
- I'm not a goddamn Russian spy.
- I didn't say you were.

245
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:52,709
Let's go up to my office,
we can sort this out.

246
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:55,970
No, no. We gotta go
to a secure location. Now.

247
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,425
All right.

248
00:16:57,808 --> 00:17:00,299
Doesn't get any more secure than this.

249
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:03,640
Ev? Five minutes.

250
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:05,475
Call Protective Services

251
00:17:05,732 --> 00:17:08,475
- and tell them to find Mike.
- I will.

252
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:10,814
This is bullshit.

253
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:16,649
Give us a sec, we'll be right in.

254
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:20,278
I know we're heading into your jurisdiction.

255
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:22,242
- I'm just asking for five minutes.
- No.

256
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:32,207
If I have to. You can't have five minutes.
I have to talk to her.

257
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:34,797
- She's scared. Don't you see that?
- I don't care.

258
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:38,338
There is a mole in Russia house, Ted.
There is a mole. I am sure.

259
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:53,398
Please step in the elevator.

260
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:22,048
<i>Russian president, okay?
So I'm gonna ask you to step out of my way.</i>

261
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:30,393
What the hell is that?

262
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,020
Sir.

263
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,857
I gotta pee.

264
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:19,981
<i>Where do you think he went?</i>

265
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:23,196
<i>No one saw him coming out the front.</i>

266
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,865
- Jesus Christ.
- Here he is again.

267
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:28,865
No sign of him so far on the street.

268
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:30,829
It's two minutes ago, before lockdown.

269
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,619
- Anything clean on him?
- We just got a match, sir.

270
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:35,504
It's May Day, 1981.

271
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:37,882
There's Brezhnev. And there...

272
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:39,167
- Orlov.
- That's him.

273
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:42,212
He used to be a heavyweight
once upon a time.

274
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:44,471
Get that photo out.
Every ticket counter,

275
00:19:44,642 --> 00:19:47,679
airport, train station, taxi dispatcher,
the whole nine yards.

276
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:51,016
- Get me Medford on a secure line.
- Yes, sir.

277
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:54,891
- Top-right screen. Is that live?
- Yes, sir.

278
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:56,400
Where is she going? Track her.

279
00:19:58,406 --> 00:20:01,068
<i>No one may leave the building.</i>

280
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:03,486
Rink Petroleum, Security.

281
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:06,573
Yes, you have a woman to your left,
behind you. Evelyn Salt.

282
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:12,242
- We lost the visual on her.
- Damn it. Where'd she go?

283
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,251
<i>We are on security lockdown.</i>

284
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:17,247
Dave? It's Evelyn, is Mike there?

285
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:19,923
<i>No, I'm sorry.
He left after lunch.</i>

286
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:21,504
<i>Hey, happy anniversary, huh?</i>

287
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,340
The stairwell.

288
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:26,050
- Second floor.
- What's on that floor?

289
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,887
- It's empty, a security buffer.
- Isolate and seal it.

290
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:38,358
Get her records to my handheld.

291
00:20:40,531 --> 00:20:42,237
East corridor.

292
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:49,950
<i>Notifying Metropolitan Police.</i>

293
00:20:58,716 --> 00:21:00,547
Kill the power to the elevator doors.

294
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,011
We got her.

295
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:09,514
<i>Locking down all floors.</i>

296
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:12,096
<i>Security Protective Service
responding to threat.</i>

297
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:18,357
All right. Get a tactical team
to meet me on the south stairwell.

298
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:20,688
- Yes, sir.
- Director Medford, sir.

299
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:22,694
Get me a side arm.

300
00:21:24,575 --> 00:21:25,815
I'll call her back.

301
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:33,785
- Shit.
- Lost visual.

302
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:36,708
Where is she, Albert?
Talk to me.

303
00:21:37,505 --> 00:21:38,995
Come on.

304
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:48,712
North hallway.

305
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:06,446
There, interrogation room,
bring it up.

306
00:22:44,113 --> 00:22:46,399
Switch down, switch down.

307
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,406
Have you found him?

308
00:22:53,581 --> 00:22:55,412
<i>What the hell are you doing, Ev?</i>

309
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:56,743
This doesn't look good.

310
00:22:57,418 --> 00:22:58,658
- Let's do it.
- Move.

311
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:01,293
There's a tac team coming at you
in 30 seconds.

312
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:02,919
Get your goddamn panties off the camera.

313
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:05,251
<i>Get where we can see you
so you don't get hurt.</i>

314
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:08,418
<i>- Have you found my husband?
- These boys aren't fooling around, Ev.</i>

315
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,762
<i>Please. I can't help you
unless you talk to me.</i>

316
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:17,472
Call me when you find Mike.

317
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:19,936
<i>Sweeping corridors outside the elevator.</i>

318
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:26,648
Put the masks on.

319
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:28,107
Situation is hot.

320
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:40,449
<i>Okay, open the door about two feet.
We're gonna gas her.</i>

321
00:23:40,628 --> 00:23:42,619
Tac team in position.
Waiting for a go.

322
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:44,002
Is that absolutely necessary?

323
00:23:44,173 --> 00:23:45,959
What, you want me to shoot her?

324
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,336
Get a medical team in place now.

325
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:03,556
We're ready.

326
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:08,977
Now.

327
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:17,827
<i>Okay, on my count.</i>

328
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:21,536
<i>Three, two, one. Go.</i>

329
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:29,835
Jesus Christ.

330
00:24:43,691 --> 00:24:46,899
Where is she?
Come on, guys.

331
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:49,936
<i>- Find her, Albert. Now.
- Suspect has escaped.</i>

332
00:24:50,364 --> 00:24:52,150
There. Bring that up.

333
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,071
Stay with her,
she's crossing the street.

334
00:24:57,246 --> 00:24:58,736
Pan the goddamn camera!

335
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:12,374
Back that up and zoom in.

336
00:25:12,553 --> 00:25:14,089
We're looking for Michael Krause.

337
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:15,719
Freeze.

338
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:18,179
We're looking for her husband, Mike Krause.

339
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,556
What the hell are you doing, Ev?

340
00:25:19,977 --> 00:25:22,559
Wait, when was that?
No. No message.

341
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:25,346
Let's switch to the exterior cameras.

342
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:28,436
Michael Krause left his office
at the Smithsonian an hour ago.

343
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:30,350
Salt's apartment is 20 minutes from here.

344
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,485
We can cover it,
but she won't go there.

345
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:35,318
She will if she's serious about Mike.
This stays in-house.

346
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:37,028
Okay.

347
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:38,908
Taxi!

348
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:44,369
U Street.
I'll tell you when to stop.

349
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:56,210
<i>Hi, this is Mike.
Please leave a message after the tone.</i>

350
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:25,155
He's one of the
world's top arachnologists, Ev,

351
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:28,417
and as such, enjoys pretty much
unrestricted access

352
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:30,999
to the borders of North Korea.

353
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:35,041
So, brush up on your bugs
and get to know him.

354
00:26:36,345 --> 00:26:39,132
<i>He's the perfect cover
to get us inside.</i>

355
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:20,419
Mike?

356
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:26,008
Mike? Honey?

357
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:34,395
Hey, baby. Hey, baby.

358
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:36,526
It's all right. Shh.

359
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:39,855
It's okay. Where's Daddy?
Where's Daddy?

360
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,061
Come on. Come on.

361
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:22,860
Check for back exits.

362
00:28:40,636 --> 00:28:42,422
Go! Go!

363
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:48,674
Bedroom, clear!

364
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:52,059
Kitchen is clear.

365
00:28:53,774 --> 00:28:55,856
Office, clear!

366
00:28:56,318 --> 00:28:58,775
Living room, clear!

367
00:29:25,514 --> 00:29:27,596
Everybody out. Sixty seconds.

368
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,166
Come here.

369
00:29:58,338 --> 00:29:59,748
What are you doing?

370
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:02,414
She's not here.
No sign of the husband either.

371
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:05,083
Did it ever occur to you that
maybe that Russian was lying?

372
00:30:05,262 --> 00:30:06,752
- Why'd she run?
- I don't know.

373
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:09,842
Because you were gonna lock her up?
See it from her perspective.

374
00:30:10,017 --> 00:30:12,099
Maybe her husband
is in some real danger.

375
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:14,510
Maybe, God forbid,
Salt is who she says she is.

376
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:16,345
"Maybe" is your department.

377
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:19,185
Mine is catching her
so we can find out.

378
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:22,021
Protocol is clear. We bring her in
or we bring her down.

379
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:24,311
Do you have any idea
who this woman is?

380
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:27,526
What she's done for this country?
Does that mean anything to you?

381
00:30:27,701 --> 00:30:28,907
Should it?

382
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:33,737
- Is your mom home?
- No.

383
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:35,530
- No? Can you do me a favor?
- Yeah.

384
00:30:35,709 --> 00:30:37,870
Hi. You baby-sit Burt for me?

385
00:30:38,045 --> 00:30:42,038
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah? Here's some money for food.

386
00:30:42,591 --> 00:30:43,956
Hi, Burt.

387
00:30:44,134 --> 00:30:45,920
What you doing?
You doing homework?

388
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:48,130
Yeah, math.

389
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:51,968
- Algebra.
- I hate math.

390
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:05,061
Hi. Nice to see you again.

391
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:08,822
- You talking to me?
- Yeah, I've seen you here before.

392
00:31:09,743 --> 00:31:13,327
Yeah, I--
Yeah, I come here a lot.

393
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:14,486
You?

394
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:16,154
Oh, I'm working here.

395
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:17,539
At the museum.

396
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:20,576
- I'm an arachnologist.
- A what?

397
00:31:20,754 --> 00:31:22,995
A spider hunter.

398
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:26,502
You look like one.

399
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:34,264
There are 40,000 species
of spiders in the world.

400
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,972
And that one is mine.

401
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:39,181
You discovered it.

402
00:31:39,356 --> 00:31:40,596
Inside North Korea.

403
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:46,276
I named it Terrijoolsima Peterbesti.

404
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:49,528
Do you get that?

405
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:52,569
No. Should I?

406
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:55,406
Peterbesti?
I named it after Pete Best.

407
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,116
The first drummer before Ringo.

408
00:31:58,125 --> 00:32:01,458
Best never was a famous Beatle,

409
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:07,297
but now he's a famous spider.

410
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:29,818
I got her.

411
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:32,732
<i>She's heading north
towards the Metro station.</i>

412
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:34,490
Ev!

413
00:32:58,894 --> 00:33:00,384
Ev!

414
00:33:10,489 --> 00:33:12,946
She's eastbound,
in the Penn Quarter Mall.

415
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:18,360
Excuse me.

416
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:32,040
<i>Will do. Headed there now.</i>

417
00:33:32,219 --> 00:33:33,925
There she is.

418
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:37,380
All teams, southbound toward the bridge.
Box her in.

419
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:49,311
Circle around!

420
00:33:49,528 --> 00:33:51,234
Salt! Stop!

421
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:53,690
- Keep her in your sights!
- Coming up behind you!

422
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,230
Fuck!

423
00:33:59,329 --> 00:34:01,240
Keep back! Hold your fire!

424
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:03,613
Salt! Down!

425
00:34:05,252 --> 00:34:06,913
Salt!

426
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,716
Spread out!

427
00:34:15,804 --> 00:34:17,920
- Salt!
- Don't shoot! Don't shoot, I'm innocent!

428
00:34:18,098 --> 00:34:20,214
- On the ground. Now!
- Please don't. No!

429
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:23,429
Down! Salt! Do it now!
On the ground!

430
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:24,809
I have to find my husband.

431
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,766
- Why'd you run?
- I have to find my husband!

432
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,726
- That's not a reason.
- Please, don't shoot.

433
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,265
- Stay back!
- Last chance.

434
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:32,934
I'm innocent.
Somebody is setting me up!

435
00:34:33,113 --> 00:34:35,445
- Don't make me put you down, Salt.
- Put the goddamn gun down!

436
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:37,151
- Give yourself up!
- Come on, Ev.

437
00:34:37,367 --> 00:34:39,858
Do what he says.
We'll sort this out, I promise.

438
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:43,278
I gotta bring you in, Salt.
It's over. Face down.

439
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:46,072
Somebody's going to try
to kill the Russian president.

440
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:48,993
Do something about that!
That's what you should worry about.

441
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:51,461
There's nowhere to run!
Quit now!

442
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:52,962
No, I didn't do anything.

443
00:34:53,133 --> 00:34:54,498
Get back! No!

444
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:05,137
She's on a blue semi.
Route 1, heading north.

445
00:35:05,312 --> 00:35:07,143
Get a roadblock in place now.

446
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:21,153
<i>Metro Police on alert.</i>

447
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:02,357
There she is.
On the tanker.

448
00:36:03,036 --> 00:36:05,072
Stop. Stop!

449
00:36:15,465 --> 00:36:17,001
Ev!

450
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:35,307
You, my friend,
have got a mole in your group.

451
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:38,727
- We don't know that yet.
- I'd say she's a trained goddamn liar

452
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:41,612
and everything she's said up until now
has been to protect her cover.

453
00:36:41,783 --> 00:36:44,399
Well, why don't you tell me
how you really feel about it?

454
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:37,251
Get up on the shoulder!
Get up on the shoulder!

455
00:37:56,775 --> 00:37:57,855
Okay, take it down.

456
00:38:08,578 --> 00:38:09,693
Shit!

457
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:14,034
Shit!

458
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:21,667
Okay.

459
00:38:22,175 --> 00:38:24,461
Ted, I know you're her friend,

460
00:38:25,178 --> 00:38:27,089
but we gotta drop a net on New York.

461
00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:30,339
- We gotta do it now.
- Let's go!

462
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:36,432
Notify the Secret Service
on Matveyev's detail.

463
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:40,353
Tell them Salt might be coming their way.

464
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:46,233
And if she is,
Orlov may not be far behind either.

465
00:38:48,243 --> 00:38:49,278
You seen this?

466
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:51,864
Salt spent time in Russia as a kid.

467
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:56,327
She was in a car accident with her parents
in '88. They both died.

468
00:38:57,752 --> 00:39:02,371
They were teachers at the U.S. Embassy
for the American children of the staff.

469
00:39:02,799 --> 00:39:05,506
That's why we put her on Russia
in the first place.

470
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:10,553
We need to get on a plane
to New York, tonight.

471
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:14,223
<i>Send everything we've got on Orlov to N.Y.P.D.</i>

472
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:11,864
<i>And here in New York City,
security has been beefed up</i>

473
00:40:12,035 --> 00:40:14,651
<i>and preparations are continuing
well into the night</i>

474
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:17,912
<i>for the funeral of
Vice President Maxwell Oates.</i>

475
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:22,621
<i>Among the dignitaries attending the service
at St. Bartholomew's Church</i>

476
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:25,252
<i>is Russian president Boris Matveyev,</i>

477
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:27,914
<i>who arrived here in Manhattan
earlier this evening.</i>

478
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:33,052
<i>Public transportation will experience delays,
with subway closures and...</i>

479
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:38,094
Evelyn.

480
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:40,301
Look at me.

481
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:45,147
If there was a way,
I would kill them.

482
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:49,943
You shouldn't have come here.

483
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:52,651
What do you mean?
I don't understand.

484
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:56,526
Now they know who you are.

485
00:40:56,955 --> 00:40:58,570
Who?

486
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:01,413
Evelyn.

487
00:41:02,627 --> 00:41:04,458
Who?

488
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:08,796
I would accept anything about you,

489
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:10,707
but I need to know.

490
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:13,968
So look at me.
Look at me.

491
00:41:15,974 --> 00:41:18,636
Just tell me, okay?

492
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:20,300
Just tell me.

493
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:24,554
I work...

494
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:27,474
I work for the CIA.

495
00:41:29,988 --> 00:41:31,979
So you see, there's...

496
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:35,899
There's no future for us.

497
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:40,987
You're not safe with me.

498
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:44,494
I don't wanna be safe.

499
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:48,711
I know you,

500
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,547
and I wanna be with you.

501
00:41:52,802 --> 00:41:56,340
I want to spend the rest
of my life with you.

502
00:41:58,307 --> 00:41:59,797
Okay?

503
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:04,640
Okay. Okay.

504
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:28,584
Welcome to New York, Miss Hernandez.
One night, a deluxe room.

505
00:42:29,047 --> 00:42:30,878
Do you need any help
with your luggage?

506
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:32,209
Nope, I got it. Thanks.

507
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:41,384
I'll put these in the closet, sir?

508
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:43,174
Yeah, fine.

509
00:44:10,523 --> 00:44:12,012
<i>I do solemnly swear...</i>

510
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:13,680
I do solemnly swear...

511
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:20,857
that I will support and defend
the Constitution of the United States

512
00:44:21,033 --> 00:44:26,323
against all enemies,
foreign and domestic.

513
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:30,160
That I will faithfully discharge

514
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:32,871
the duties of the office
on which I'm about to enter.

515
00:44:33,254 --> 00:44:36,087
The duties of the office
on which I am about to enter.

516
00:44:36,257 --> 00:44:39,545
- So help me God.
- So help me God.

517
00:44:45,016 --> 00:44:47,803
<i>A solemn day here in New York City.</i>

518
00:44:47,977 --> 00:44:50,889
<i>The funeral of Vice President
Maxwell Oates,</i>

519
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:54,772
<i>a former five-term U.S. senator
and Cold War warrior</i>

520
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:57,308
<i>whose greatest legacy
may be as architect</i>

521
00:44:57,486 --> 00:45:00,774
of the new era
of Russian-American relations.

522
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:02,939
Russian president Boris Matveyev

523
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:05,904
<i>has journeyed from Moscow
to be an honorary pallbearer</i>

524
00:45:06,078 --> 00:45:10,287
<i>to the man he's called
his greatest friend in the West.</i>

525
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:10,472
What's the security perimeter?

526
00:46:10,643 --> 00:46:13,680
We're two deep inside
and we own this entire block.

527
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:17,187
And those are Secret Service agents,
not CIA.

528
00:46:17,358 --> 00:46:20,816
- So relax.
- That's real funny.

529
00:46:21,362 --> 00:46:23,523
Didn't know you guys told jokes.

530
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:28,608
Detail, halt.

531
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:33,032
Forward, march.

532
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:54,304
<i>Due to the funeral,
the 51st Street station is closed.</i>

533
00:46:57,648 --> 00:47:02,813
<i>Repeat: Due to the funeral,
the 51st Street station is closed.</i>

534
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:09,065
What--?
Hey, what's going on?

535
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:10,653
Hey! There's smoke.

536
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:15,947
Step back, step back.
Everybody, move out of the way.

537
00:47:50,451 --> 00:47:52,737
Eleanor.
Good to see you.

538
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:55,027
Thank you.

539
00:47:57,833 --> 00:48:00,996
- Boris.
- Mr. President.

540
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:06,835
Hello.

541
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:20,060
Please be seated.

542
00:48:32,076 --> 00:48:34,658
<i>Stand by for president's speech.</i>

543
00:48:36,372 --> 00:48:40,832
<i>Patrolling church exterior.
No one in or out the side doors.</i>

544
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:43,580
Mrs. Oates.

545
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:48,756
Eleanor, Joe, Marissa, Donald...

546
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:53,010
After the president, the choir sings,
then Matveyev delivers the eulogy.

547
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:56,343
If your girl tries anything here,
it'd have to be pretty amazing.

548
00:49:00,729 --> 00:49:05,348
<i>I knew he would bring more to the job
than just his years of experience.</i>

549
00:49:05,693 --> 00:49:07,809
As vice president,

550
00:49:07,987 --> 00:49:12,526
he showed the world the best
of what it is to be an American.

551
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:14,318
And today,

552
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:19,237
the world says goodbye to a great man.

553
00:49:28,591 --> 00:49:30,206
I'll check the back.

554
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:32,716
Lima Zulu 4, clear.

555
00:49:58,746 --> 00:50:01,078
<i>My friendship with Maxwell Oates</i>

556
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:04,240
began in the unlikeliest of places:

557
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:06,283
<i>Lima Zulu 4, come in.</i>

558
00:50:06,462 --> 00:50:08,327
<i>Across the negotiating table...</i>

559
00:50:08,506 --> 00:50:10,246
<i>What's your status, Lima Zulu 4?</i>

560
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:11,630
We got two MIAs.

561
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:16,920
Lima Zulu 4 in the utility tunnel
outside the crypt entrance and Lima Zulu 5.

562
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:20,214
I'm heading down to the crypt.
Some kind of trouble down there.

563
00:50:20,392 --> 00:50:22,007
What's going on, guys?
Talk to me.

564
00:50:22,186 --> 00:50:25,303
Subunits Lima Zulu 1, 2 and 3,
converge on the crypt. Repeat:

565
00:50:25,481 --> 00:50:26,561
<i>Converge on the crypt.</i>

566
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:28,768
He made all the difference,
and for that,

567
00:50:28,943 --> 00:50:33,812
he will always have
my respect and admiration.

568
00:51:19,661 --> 00:51:22,617
That is what my friend Maxwell Oates
would have said.

569
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:30,580
What's going on?

570
00:51:41,432 --> 00:51:42,968
Matveyev.

571
00:51:43,851 --> 00:51:45,011
Get goddamn Matveyev.

572
00:52:00,159 --> 00:52:02,821
- Get the bomb squad in here!
- Go, go!

573
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:44,240
Drop it!

574
00:52:46,246 --> 00:52:47,281
Drop it!

575
00:52:54,213 --> 00:52:57,501
- Any MTs down here?
- I see her.

576
00:52:57,675 --> 00:53:00,417
- Keep your hands up!
- Shooter's at 12 o'clock.

577
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:03,836
- Gun! She's got a gun. She has a gun!
- Don't move!

578
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:06,221
- Do not move! Do not move!
- Keep your hands up!

579
00:53:06,392 --> 00:53:08,007
Take her down, take her down!

580
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:09,641
Check for other weapons.

581
00:53:10,896 --> 00:53:13,057
We need a medical crew
in the crypt immediately.

582
00:53:13,232 --> 00:53:15,063
I can't feel a pulse.

583
00:53:15,401 --> 00:53:18,359
Jurisdiction is clear.
This is New York City.

584
00:53:18,529 --> 00:53:20,986
N.Y.P.D. has her.
She's going to 1 Police Plaza.

585
00:53:21,156 --> 00:53:23,693
- I'm not arguing jurisdiction.
- We don't know yet, sir.

586
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:26,449
- The shooter is CIA. I know her.
- Yes, I'll be there.

587
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:28,076
I'll be on the next chopper out, sir.

588
00:53:28,247 --> 00:53:31,364
- Have your superior call the mayor.
- Open up, guy, open up!

589
00:53:33,085 --> 00:53:34,416
Back it up! Back it up!

590
00:53:34,586 --> 00:53:37,544
Come on, guys. Keep moving.
Keep moving. Keep moving.

591
00:53:38,924 --> 00:53:40,130
Let's go, let's go.

592
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:41,915
Hey, watch this guy, watch this guy.

593
00:53:42,094 --> 00:53:43,334
- Back up!
- Keep moving.

594
00:53:43,512 --> 00:53:44,592
Sir, back up!

595
00:53:44,763 --> 00:53:47,505
Why? Why?

596
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:51,801
Do you have any idea
how much blood is on your hands?

597
00:53:51,979 --> 00:53:53,560
You're gonna rot in a hole, Salt.

598
00:53:53,731 --> 00:53:55,767
I'm gonna see to it personally!
A dark goddamn hole!

599
00:53:55,941 --> 00:53:57,431
Get a hold of yourself.

600
00:53:58,110 --> 00:53:59,600
Get the door, get the door.

601
00:53:59,778 --> 00:54:02,440
- Get off me!
- Back off, man! Back off!

602
00:54:02,614 --> 00:54:03,945
That's it. Let's go.

603
00:54:05,033 --> 00:54:06,898
Stand back.

604
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:10,156
Close it! Go, go, go!

605
00:54:22,426 --> 00:54:25,964
Matveyev was declared dead
en route to the hospital.

606
00:54:26,388 --> 00:54:27,719
Jesus Christ.

607
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:29,300
Yeah.

608
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,636
You were right about her.

609
00:54:32,644 --> 00:54:35,135
She had the drop on me, Ted.

610
00:54:36,482 --> 00:54:38,222
Why didn't she shoot?

611
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:05,457
<i>Natasha.</i>

612
00:55:06,178 --> 00:55:07,839
Natasha.

613
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:09,753
Is that you?

614
00:55:10,557 --> 00:55:13,014
Did they give you a new face?

615
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:16,852
I'm going home tomorrow, Shnaider.

616
00:55:17,356 --> 00:55:18,846
Home to Grozny?

617
00:55:19,024 --> 00:55:23,267
My home is in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

618
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:28,905
My favorite place there
is McDonald's on Fern Street

619
00:55:29,201 --> 00:55:31,408
because it's near the river.

620
00:55:32,454 --> 00:55:34,740
But I won't want to go there anymore

621
00:55:35,123 --> 00:55:38,081
because my mother and father are dead.

622
00:55:38,627 --> 00:55:39,958
Natasha,

623
00:55:41,547 --> 00:55:43,333
will you miss me?

624
00:55:44,424 --> 00:55:48,633
My name is Evelyn Salt.

625
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:11,068
Cop down, cop down!
Hear me!

626
00:56:59,374 --> 00:57:03,617
Get out of the car
with your hands on your head!

627
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:06,624
Right now!
Hands in the air!

628
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:27,353
- Hey, did you see that?
- Hey, get those guys over here.

629
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:29,813
Get them over here to help.

630
00:57:44,836 --> 00:57:47,418
Somebody help me get him out.
Help me get him out.

631
00:58:22,457 --> 00:58:24,163
<i>What college will you attend?</i>

632
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:26,199
Princeton University.

633
00:58:26,378 --> 00:58:27,538
Where will you work?

634
00:58:27,713 --> 00:58:29,704
The Central Intelligence Agency.

635
00:58:29,881 --> 00:58:31,621
Who will you trust?

636
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:33,506
No one.

637
00:58:33,677 --> 00:58:36,043
Be very patient.

638
00:58:36,221 --> 00:58:37,927
Remember your training.

639
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:42,098
Remember, you're not the only one.

640
00:58:42,269 --> 00:58:43,884
There are many others.

641
00:58:44,062 --> 00:58:47,350
All of you waiting to strike.

642
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:49,606
- Yes.
- And we will strike.

643
00:58:50,318 --> 00:58:53,481
- Together.
- Yes.

644
00:58:56,074 --> 00:58:57,564
Wait.

645
00:59:00,328 --> 00:59:04,241
One day, I will come for all of you.

646
00:59:10,338 --> 00:59:12,078
Hello, Evelyn.

647
00:59:12,424 --> 00:59:15,587
I'm Martin Crenshaw from the U.S. Embassy.

648
00:59:16,261 --> 00:59:19,674
We're very sorry about
your family's accident.

649
00:59:26,772 --> 00:59:30,606
<i>Rioters outside the U.S. Embassy
cheered their new leader's words</i>

650
00:59:30,776 --> 00:59:34,268
<i>and called on him to take strong action
against what they are calling</i>

651
00:59:34,446 --> 00:59:38,064
<i>a state-sponsored act of terrorism
on the part of the U.S.</i>

652
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:40,277
<i>These riots are sparking
similar outbreaks</i>

653
00:59:40,452 --> 00:59:43,615
<i>of anti-American protests across Russia.</i>

654
00:59:43,789 --> 00:59:46,952
<i>"We will strike back,"
says the new Russian president,</i>

655
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:49,537
<i>angrily condemning today's assassination</i>

656
00:59:49,711 --> 00:59:53,169
<i>by American intelligence officer Evelyn Salt.</i>

657
00:59:53,757 --> 00:59:57,341
<i>Even as the body of slain President Matveyev
is on its Way back to Moscow,</i>

658
00:59:57,511 --> 01:00:00,093
<i>anti-American riots
have erupted across Russia,</i>

659
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:02,970
<i>with bombings of U.S. Diplomats' cars in Moscow.</i>

660
01:00:04,309 --> 01:00:07,221
<i>The Russian armed forces
have been put on high alert.</i>

661
01:00:07,687 --> 01:00:10,429
<i>Responding to a rapidly escalating crisis,</i>

662
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:13,815
<i>President Lewis has called for
an emergency White House meeting</i>

663
01:00:13,985 --> 01:00:17,398
<i>with cabinet members, military leaders
and NATO representatives.</i>

664
01:00:17,572 --> 01:00:20,484
Greetings, Comrade Chenkov!

665
01:00:26,665 --> 01:00:29,577
When I saw you in Washington,
I almost ran to you.

666
01:00:37,008 --> 01:00:39,715
You were not supposed to get married.

667
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:44,300
Not unless it had great tactical advantage.

668
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:46,180
I did it to seem normal.

669
01:00:47,018 --> 01:00:49,009
When you escaped today, I thought:

670
01:00:49,187 --> 01:00:53,351
"Even I could not have hoped for so much."

671
01:00:53,775 --> 01:00:57,393
You are my greatest creation.

672
01:00:58,572 --> 01:01:00,733
You trained me well.

673
01:01:37,235 --> 01:01:40,352
My husband, you have him?

674
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:42,896
I had to be certain.

675
01:01:43,074 --> 01:01:45,156
But now you trust me?

676
01:01:45,327 --> 01:01:46,362
Completely.

677
01:01:54,586 --> 01:01:58,499
So, tell me what's next.

678
01:01:58,757 --> 01:02:00,998
Next, part two:

679
01:02:01,509 --> 01:02:05,502
We seize control
of this country's atomic weapons.

680
01:02:06,431 --> 01:02:07,796
How?

681
01:02:07,974 --> 01:02:09,589
You'll see.

682
01:02:10,936 --> 01:02:12,176
All right.

683
01:02:57,649 --> 01:03:00,015
Are you ready to watch him die?

684
01:03:08,493 --> 01:03:09,528
Give me the gun.

685
01:03:11,204 --> 01:03:13,445
That would be too easy.

686
01:04:12,515 --> 01:04:14,801
Satisfied?

687
01:04:16,311 --> 01:04:17,517
I'm satisfied.

688
01:04:19,814 --> 01:04:21,179
Comrades,

689
01:04:21,483 --> 01:04:25,101
our sister has rejoined us.

690
01:04:25,487 --> 01:04:28,570
Russia will rise from the ashes

691
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:32,198
of the greatest war
the world has ever seen.

692
01:04:33,912 --> 01:04:36,028
And the world will hear us!

693
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:37,870
Will hear.

694
01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:42,708
Welcome back to our family, sister.

695
01:04:45,673 --> 01:04:46,708
Sister.

696
01:04:54,891 --> 01:05:00,807
Russia has changed.
But our lives will not be wasted.

697
01:05:02,649 --> 01:05:07,234
You're to meet an agent,
NATO uniform, at a plane here.

698
01:05:07,987 --> 01:05:13,357
Tail number N182SL.

699
01:05:14,744 --> 01:05:18,908
Final instructions will come from him.

700
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:22,206
- That's it.
- That's it.

701
01:05:22,752 --> 01:05:25,414
After this, we go dark.

702
01:05:26,131 --> 01:05:28,213
Radio silent.

703
01:05:29,092 --> 01:05:31,003
You won't hear from me again,

704
01:05:31,594 --> 01:05:32,834
my daughter.

705
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:35,962
<i>Forever and ever.</i>

706
01:07:59,117 --> 01:08:01,529
Have you heard from Orlov?

707
01:08:01,703 --> 01:08:03,864
Yes. Last word was "go."

708
01:08:08,668 --> 01:08:10,374
Chenkov.

709
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:13,536
Do you remember me?

710
01:08:18,886 --> 01:08:20,001
<i>Chenkov.</i>

711
01:08:21,389 --> 01:08:23,050
Did you miss me?

712
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:24,806
Shnaider?

713
01:08:29,355 --> 01:08:30,640
How long have you been here?

714
01:08:33,067 --> 01:08:37,106
I left Russia one year after you.
To Prague.

715
01:08:37,363 --> 01:08:40,981
I've been the NATO liaison
to the White House for three years.

716
01:08:41,409 --> 01:08:44,071
Colonel Edward Tomas.

717
01:08:44,412 --> 01:08:47,575
And you are my attaché.

718
01:08:47,749 --> 01:08:49,410
Your ID.

719
01:08:50,084 --> 01:08:52,416
Don't worry, we have plenty of time.

720
01:08:52,587 --> 01:08:55,499
More importantly, our mission.

721
01:08:55,882 --> 01:09:00,296
The bunker eight stories
below the White House.

722
01:09:02,263 --> 01:09:04,003
That's where the president needs to be.

723
01:09:09,270 --> 01:09:10,430
How do we do it?

724
01:09:10,605 --> 01:09:14,689
Don't worry, he'll be there. That's my job.
I'll make sure he's there.

725
01:09:15,526 --> 01:09:18,984
- What's my job?
- Do you remember, Chenkov,

726
01:09:19,155 --> 01:09:22,898
when we were young and you had
to finish first in everything?

727
01:09:23,076 --> 01:09:24,816
Had to be the best at everything.

728
01:09:25,036 --> 01:09:29,029
Even though you knew you would be beaten
with a cane, you had to finish first.

729
01:09:29,207 --> 01:09:30,788
I remember.

730
01:09:30,958 --> 01:09:34,450
Tonight you will finish
ahead of me again.

731
01:09:37,173 --> 01:09:41,462
Tonight you will kill America's president.

732
01:09:54,315 --> 01:09:56,146
IDs, please.

733
01:09:56,818 --> 01:09:58,934
Pop the hood and open the trunk.

734
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:00,856
I'll check the side.

735
01:10:03,783 --> 01:10:05,148
Control, this is Hayes.

736
01:10:05,326 --> 01:10:08,193
I have a Colonel Tomas and a Major Vicek.

737
01:10:08,371 --> 01:10:09,702
Undercarriage is clean.

738
01:10:10,998 --> 01:10:11,987
Back's clean.

739
01:10:13,418 --> 01:10:16,626
Colonel. Major.
All clear.

740
01:10:29,016 --> 01:10:31,132
You know the drill, colonel.

741
01:10:32,311 --> 01:10:34,893
Shrapnel. A Serbian landmine.

742
01:10:35,064 --> 01:10:38,056
They've spent more time looking at it
than the doctor did.

743
01:10:41,571 --> 01:10:43,687
Step through, please, sir.

744
01:10:47,618 --> 01:10:48,778
Turn around.

745
01:10:52,248 --> 01:10:53,863
Thank you.

746
01:10:58,379 --> 01:11:01,121
- Step through. Arms out.
- Patience is key.

747
01:11:01,299 --> 01:11:04,382
I've been coming here for two years,
others have been here even longer.

748
01:11:04,552 --> 01:11:06,884
- What others?
- I don't know.

749
01:11:07,054 --> 01:11:10,217
But you were the best of us
and I was the least.

750
01:11:10,391 --> 01:11:13,849
There must be others,
here to finish what we begin.

751
01:11:14,020 --> 01:11:15,726
Colonel Tomas.
Good to see you again.

752
01:11:15,897 --> 01:11:17,103
- Major Vicek.
- Pleasure.

753
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:20,185
You have exactly two minutes to preview
NATO's point of view before the main meeting.

754
01:11:21,694 --> 01:11:24,527
Now, Ted, your Russian CIA agent, Salt.

755
01:11:24,697 --> 01:11:28,030
- What can you tell us about her?
- We think she may be a Soviet plant,

756
01:11:29,076 --> 01:11:33,911
inserted years ago in preparation
for something the KGB called Day X.

757
01:11:34,081 --> 01:11:38,245
A day that would mark the start of a large
scale strike against the U.S. and her allies.

758
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:48,001
This should be the president now.

759
01:11:50,932 --> 01:11:53,139
You have a big job, Chenkov,

760
01:11:53,309 --> 01:11:54,594
but you can do it.

761
01:11:54,936 --> 01:11:57,097
You still haven't told me
what your job is.

762
01:11:57,396 --> 01:11:59,136
Home.

763
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:01,055
I'm going home.

764
01:12:04,695 --> 01:12:06,936
- Down! Take cover!
- Get the president!

765
01:12:07,365 --> 01:12:09,572
- A gun! He's got a gun!
- Get back!

766
01:12:11,911 --> 01:12:13,196
Get back!

767
01:12:26,634 --> 01:12:27,794
- Are you okay, sir?
- Yes.

768
01:12:27,969 --> 01:12:30,711
- Goddamn it.
- Geronimo is SOP, downward mobile.

769
01:12:36,477 --> 01:12:37,557
Help, over here!

770
01:12:39,856 --> 01:12:42,142
Get a medic! Get a medic!

771
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:51,314
I think I saw her.

772
01:12:51,742 --> 01:12:53,357
You saw who?

773
01:12:55,204 --> 01:12:56,614
Salt.

774
01:12:57,748 --> 01:12:59,363
I think I saw her in the corridor.

775
01:13:01,878 --> 01:13:03,414
The other NATO officer.

776
01:13:06,841 --> 01:13:08,047
She's here.

777
01:13:09,552 --> 01:13:10,712
Check.

778
01:13:10,887 --> 01:13:12,252
- Clear.
- Move.

779
01:13:12,972 --> 01:13:14,007
Go!

780
01:13:14,181 --> 01:13:16,763
We may have a visual on a second assailant.
Evelyn Salt.

781
01:13:16,934 --> 01:13:20,097
Repeat: Evelyn Salt on premises.
May be dressed as a NATO officer.

782
01:13:21,063 --> 01:13:24,555
<i>This is not a drill.
The White House is under attack.</i>

783
01:13:24,734 --> 01:13:28,602
<i>If you are near an exit,
please proceed outside in an orderly manner.</i>

784
01:13:28,779 --> 01:13:30,565
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

785
01:13:31,073 --> 01:13:33,405
I need this hallway cleared
to the left, now!

786
01:13:34,744 --> 01:13:37,702
Command, this is Jenks.
I need the PEOC bunker up and running.

787
01:13:37,872 --> 01:13:40,238
If this was authorized
by the Russian government,

788
01:13:40,416 --> 01:13:42,953
it is an act of war,
and we will respond.

789
01:13:44,253 --> 01:13:48,371
<i>If you are near an exit,
please proceed outside in an orderly manner.</i>

790
01:13:48,549 --> 01:13:50,460
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

791
01:13:50,635 --> 01:13:52,296
- Clear!
- Let's go, sir.

792
01:13:55,014 --> 01:13:56,595
Alpha team!
Move! Move! Move!

793
01:14:00,311 --> 01:14:01,926
Move, move.

794
01:14:02,605 --> 01:14:03,936
Close it.

795
01:14:04,273 --> 01:14:05,604
Close it.

796
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:15,606
<i>Please proceed outside in an orderly manner.</i>

797
01:14:15,785 --> 01:14:17,867
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

798
01:14:48,943 --> 01:14:50,353
Go, go.

799
01:14:52,279 --> 01:14:54,816
Geronimo approaching
bunker door in five seconds.

800
01:14:59,578 --> 01:15:00,943
Clear.

801
01:15:08,963 --> 01:15:10,203
Any chance she could follow?

802
01:15:10,381 --> 01:15:12,463
My own men couldn't get through that door,
once it's close.

803
01:15:12,633 --> 01:15:15,295
Yeah, well, unfortunately,
she isn't one of yours.

804
01:15:19,682 --> 01:15:20,671
Okay, go.

805
01:15:22,351 --> 01:15:24,182
Stay until it's shut and sealed.

806
01:15:28,107 --> 01:15:30,063
Geronimo secured.

807
01:15:58,512 --> 01:16:00,503
- Get me Director Medford.
- Yes, sir.

808
01:16:01,348 --> 01:16:04,385
Sir, I think we need to
seriously consider the possibility

809
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:07,427
that today, right now,
could be the start of Day X.

810
01:16:08,147 --> 01:16:10,638
Mr. President, Director Medford is up.

811
01:16:11,901 --> 01:16:13,391
Marion, what's the situation?

812
01:16:13,569 --> 01:16:16,561
<i>It should be coming up
on one of your screens.</i>

813
01:16:17,114 --> 01:16:19,400
What you see there
represents temperature drops

814
01:16:19,575 --> 01:16:21,736
in mobile missile units in Siberia.

815
01:16:22,244 --> 01:16:25,736
<i>It means the Russians are deploying
their missiles to the field.</i>

816
01:16:25,915 --> 01:16:29,499
<i>And that's been confirmed
on the ground, Mr. President.</i>

817
01:16:30,669 --> 01:16:34,161
Mr. President, I strongly recommend
we go from DEFCON 4 to DEFCON 2.

818
01:16:34,340 --> 01:16:36,752
At least at our forward bases.

819
01:16:38,427 --> 01:16:39,542
Do it.

820
01:16:40,054 --> 01:16:42,090
And since the Russians have deployed,

821
01:16:42,890 --> 01:16:46,007
we need to look at
our own nuclear attack options.

822
01:16:46,435 --> 01:16:49,268
It's not on the table,
it's not a deterrent.

823
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:53,306
Thanks, Marion.
We'll come back to you.

824
01:17:13,587 --> 01:17:15,123
Sir.

825
01:17:18,134 --> 01:17:21,251
The outer portal door is jammed.
No response.

826
01:17:21,428 --> 01:17:24,170
And we just lost the feed
from most of our security cameras.

827
01:17:24,348 --> 01:17:26,964
We're blind down here
and no one can enter this facility.

828
01:17:27,143 --> 01:17:31,261
Command, our eyes are down both ways.
We have a PEOC outer security door malfunction.

829
01:17:31,730 --> 01:17:33,391
Get out there, now.

830
01:17:33,566 --> 01:17:35,431
Seal this room.

831
01:17:37,528 --> 01:17:39,109
Down that corridor.
Secure it.

832
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:26,862
<i>Victims are being taken to
George Washington Hospital.</i>

833
01:18:27,036 --> 01:18:31,075
<i>Reports are coming in that there
are casualties at the White House.</i>

834
01:18:32,583 --> 01:18:34,323
This is President Howard Lewis.

835
01:18:34,501 --> 01:18:38,335
<i>- Proceed with authentication.
- Yes, Mr. President.</i>

836
01:18:42,551 --> 01:18:44,462
Ready to commence authentication.

837
01:18:44,637 --> 01:18:45,626
Zulu.

838
01:18:45,804 --> 01:18:46,839
- Tango.
- Echo.

839
01:18:47,014 --> 01:18:48,003
- Seven.
- Niner.

840
01:18:48,182 --> 01:18:49,388
<i>- Juliette.
- X-ray.</i>

841
01:18:49,558 --> 01:18:50,547
<i>- Sierra.
- Seven.</i>

842
01:18:50,726 --> 01:18:51,715
<i>- Alfa.
- Mike.</i>

843
01:18:51,894 --> 01:18:53,555
- Charlie.
- Whiskey.

844
01:18:53,729 --> 01:18:54,718
<i>- Five.
- Six.</i>

845
01:18:54,897 --> 01:18:55,886
<i>Tango.</i>

846
01:18:56,065 --> 01:18:58,021
<i>Authentication codes confirmed.</i>

847
01:18:58,734 --> 01:19:00,565
<i>It's all yours now, Mr. President.</i>

848
01:19:01,195 --> 01:19:02,435
God be with you.

849
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:07,277
Attack options and targeting
under your control, Mr. President.

850
01:19:07,451 --> 01:19:09,407
Anders and Nablo,
what's your location?

851
01:19:10,537 --> 01:19:12,823
<i>Anders and Nablo,
what's your location?</i>

852
01:19:14,541 --> 01:19:17,453
Is the camera outside this door working?
Put it up.

853
01:19:17,628 --> 01:19:19,664
Officer Dryer, what's your status?

854
01:19:21,340 --> 01:19:22,420
Officer Dryer, come in.

855
01:19:22,883 --> 01:19:25,374
<i>Federal Communication Commission</i>

856
01:19:25,552 --> 01:19:27,588
<i>is activating the Emergency Alert System.</i>

857
01:19:27,763 --> 01:19:29,344
Who the hell's that?

858
01:19:30,266 --> 01:19:33,053
That's her.
That's Evelyn Salt.

859
01:19:33,227 --> 01:19:34,933
She's in.
Go to DEFCON 1.

860
01:19:35,104 --> 01:19:36,594
Give me your side arm.

861
01:19:36,772 --> 01:19:40,310
No, sir. Only Secret Service possess
firearms in the president's vicinity.

862
01:19:40,484 --> 01:19:42,190
Screw protocol, James.
We got an enemy agent.

863
01:19:42,361 --> 01:19:44,317
Protocol is protocol, sir.

864
01:19:44,655 --> 01:19:47,488
And dead is dead.

865
01:19:48,242 --> 01:19:49,903
Behind me!

866
01:19:51,287 --> 01:19:52,993
I'm the national security advisor.

867
01:19:53,497 --> 01:19:54,486
Not anymore.

868
01:20:02,423 --> 01:20:03,458
Sit down.

869
01:20:06,844 --> 01:20:07,833
Who are you?

870
01:20:08,387 --> 01:20:11,345
My name, Mr. President,
is Nikolai Tarkovsky.

871
01:20:12,599 --> 01:20:15,090
And unless you do exactly as I say,

872
01:20:15,436 --> 01:20:17,848
I will be the last person
you will ever see.

873
01:20:23,861 --> 01:20:26,193
Shall we look at some
selective attack options?

874
01:20:26,530 --> 01:20:27,815
Go to hell.

875
01:20:54,767 --> 01:20:58,009
<i>Selective attack options ready.</i>

876
01:20:58,228 --> 01:20:59,638
<i>Ted?</i>

877
01:20:59,813 --> 01:21:04,933
<i>Emergency action message released by...</i>

878
01:21:05,402 --> 01:21:08,565
<i>Congratulations, Comrade Chenkov.
You made it.</i>

879
01:21:08,947 --> 01:21:10,858
Why didn't you tell me?

880
01:21:13,619 --> 01:21:15,655
I tried many times, but...

881
01:21:16,413 --> 01:21:19,200
My loneliness was my only friend.

882
01:21:19,375 --> 01:21:22,082
<i>You weren't with us in Russia.
I would have remembered you.</i>

883
01:21:22,252 --> 01:21:24,208
<i>I was a class ahead, comrade.</i>

884
01:21:24,671 --> 01:21:26,662
<i>The brightest of any of Orlov's stars.</i>

885
01:21:27,132 --> 01:21:29,748
And now it's my honor
to launch the attack.

886
01:21:30,135 --> 01:21:31,671
Excuse me.

887
01:21:32,388 --> 01:21:35,880
<i>Selective attack targets acquired.</i>

888
01:21:37,184 --> 01:21:38,674
<i>Tehran.</i>

889
01:21:39,019 --> 01:21:40,429
<i>Mecca.</i>

890
01:21:41,188 --> 01:21:44,225
Mecca? Tehran?

891
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:46,061
<i>Part two of our plan.</i>

892
01:21:46,235 --> 01:21:48,191
<i>Kill nine million people.</i>

893
01:21:48,904 --> 01:21:50,360
<i>Enrage a billion Muslims.</i>

894
01:21:51,365 --> 01:21:53,356
America will suffer a painful death.

895
01:21:53,534 --> 01:21:57,868
<i>Permissive action links initiated.</i>

896
01:21:58,956 --> 01:22:01,572
<i>Missiles arming.</i>

897
01:22:07,881 --> 01:22:10,213
<i>Nuclear command</i>

898
01:22:10,551 --> 01:22:13,213
<i>posts airborne.</i>

899
01:22:13,387 --> 01:22:14,718
Let me join you.

900
01:22:16,140 --> 01:22:19,052
<i>ICMs set to</i>

901
01:22:19,435 --> 01:22:21,676
<i>maximum yield.</i>

902
01:22:23,647 --> 01:22:26,104
You know, when you first came to Langley,

903
01:22:26,733 --> 01:22:29,190
I didn't think I'd be able to do it.

904
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:32,276
<i>I didn't think I'd be able to</i>

905
01:22:33,031 --> 01:22:35,989
resist the temptation to say something.

906
01:22:36,201 --> 01:22:38,988
Then you met Mike and,

907
01:22:39,496 --> 01:22:43,409
well, things changed.

908
01:22:46,503 --> 01:22:47,788
<i>Let me join you.</i>

909
01:22:49,173 --> 01:22:53,257
All these years right in front of me
and I never knew.

910
01:23:00,267 --> 01:23:01,598
<i>Let me join you.</i>

911
01:23:02,519 --> 01:23:04,475
<i>I want to be with you.</i>

912
01:23:15,657 --> 01:23:20,617
<i>The man we thought was dead has made
a resurrection that is miraculous.</i>

913
01:23:20,787 --> 01:23:22,493
<i>President Matveyev is alive.</i>

914
01:23:22,664 --> 01:23:24,780
<i>We're going to Russia.
What you are seeing</i>

915
01:23:24,958 --> 01:23:27,415
<i>are live pictures of
Russian president Matveyev</i>

916
01:23:27,586 --> 01:23:31,454
<i>arriving at the airport outside of Moscow.
This is astonishing.</i>

917
01:23:31,632 --> 01:23:34,840
<i>According to his doctors,
President Matveyev's mistaken death</i>

918
01:23:35,010 --> 01:23:37,376
<i>is attributed to a temporary paralysis</i>

919
01:23:37,554 --> 01:23:40,091
<i>from a toxin derived from spider venom.</i>

920
01:23:40,307 --> 01:23:44,471
<i>A recap for those who may not
have been following the events of the day...</i>

921
01:23:47,689 --> 01:23:49,725
<i>At least I was right.</i>

922
01:23:52,611 --> 01:23:56,103
<i>I had a feeling we'd lost you
back there in North Korea.</i>

923
01:23:56,406 --> 01:24:00,149
<i>I could see how moved you were
by Mike's little white-knight routine.</i>

924
01:24:00,327 --> 01:24:02,488
You were supposed to recruit him, Ev,

925
01:24:02,663 --> 01:24:04,278
not fall in love with him.

926
01:24:05,541 --> 01:24:07,657
<i>That's why I told Orlov to pick him up.</i>

927
01:24:10,170 --> 01:24:12,411
<i>By the way, how is Mike?</i>

928
01:24:14,383 --> 01:24:16,465
<i>Orlov is dead.</i>

929
01:24:20,931 --> 01:24:23,217
Well, that's good news.

930
01:24:23,475 --> 01:24:24,931
Saved me the trouble.

931
01:24:26,603 --> 01:24:31,017
<i>I had to practically twist his arm
to get him to blow your cover at the CIA.</i>

932
01:24:32,818 --> 01:24:36,310
<i>You see, he wanted you
to come out of this thing alive.</i>

933
01:24:39,658 --> 01:24:41,774
But you needed somebody
to take the blame.

934
01:24:42,995 --> 01:24:45,077
<i>I'm the patsy.</i>

935
01:24:48,375 --> 01:24:50,741
<i>And I'm the hero.</i>

936
01:24:53,088 --> 01:24:55,420
Congratulations, Ev.

937
01:24:57,092 --> 01:24:59,629
<i>You're about to become famous.</i>

938
01:25:29,750 --> 01:25:36,918
<i>Identity confirmation requested.</i>

939
01:25:49,436 --> 01:25:52,394
<i>Identity confirmation requested.</i>

940
01:25:57,402 --> 01:25:59,017
<i>Identity confirmed.</i>

941
01:26:14,002 --> 01:26:18,086
<i>Minuteman III ICBMs' batteries
up to power.</i>

942
01:26:57,462 --> 01:26:59,748
<i>Authorization, 99 percent.</i>

943
01:27:06,638 --> 01:27:07,923
Go!

944
01:27:08,140 --> 01:27:10,927
<i>Permissive action links initiated.</i>

945
01:27:11,101 --> 01:27:14,764
<i>Trident submarines at firing readiness.</i>

946
01:27:15,522 --> 01:27:16,602
<i>Permission to launch.</i>

947
01:27:17,983 --> 01:27:19,268
<i>Permission to launch.</i>

948
01:27:48,930 --> 01:27:50,295
Get down on the floor, now!

949
01:27:51,057 --> 01:27:52,422
I said now!

950
01:27:57,439 --> 01:28:00,055
<i>Launch sequence aborted.
Systems restoring.</i>

951
01:28:00,233 --> 01:28:02,565
- Move, move, move!
- Show me your hands!

952
01:28:02,736 --> 01:28:04,852
- Get down!
- What is your name, sir?

953
01:28:05,030 --> 01:28:07,897
I'm Theodore Winter, CIA.
Help the president.

954
01:28:09,409 --> 01:28:11,274
Mr. President.

955
01:28:12,746 --> 01:28:15,032
Mr. President, can you hear me?

956
01:28:16,666 --> 01:28:18,497
- Hold still.
- EMT's on the way.

957
01:28:18,668 --> 01:28:20,579
Make sure they got body bags.
I got at least seven.

958
01:28:20,754 --> 01:28:22,290
She's wearing a vest.

959
01:28:22,672 --> 01:28:25,459
I'll meet you in five minutes in the
conference room, I wanna get cleaned up.

960
01:28:25,634 --> 01:28:27,215
And I want her alone in a room.

961
01:28:27,385 --> 01:28:29,842
If there are other KAs out there,
I want her talking.

962
01:28:30,055 --> 01:28:33,673
She won't talk. She's trained not to talk,
no matter what we do to her.

963
01:28:33,850 --> 01:28:36,091
If we're gonna find these people,
we gonna find them ourselves.

964
01:28:36,269 --> 01:28:38,476
Somebody already did.
At least some of them.

965
01:28:38,647 --> 01:28:41,514
Barge on the East River.
Twelve dead, including Orlov.

966
01:28:41,942 --> 01:28:43,352
Who did that?

967
01:28:45,529 --> 01:28:47,520
Don't know.
Forensics are on it.

968
01:28:49,407 --> 01:28:51,648
I'm gonna get cleaned up.
I'll be right back.

969
01:28:58,041 --> 01:29:02,284
Well, sir, you're injured. Why don't you
have a seat? We'll take a look at you.

970
01:29:03,004 --> 01:29:04,710
Are you okay?

971
01:29:05,549 --> 01:29:07,881
Pretty good gash there.

972
01:29:08,051 --> 01:29:10,667
Looks like you got
a piece of glass in there.

973
01:29:33,785 --> 01:29:35,867
<i>She killed someone else.</i>

974
01:29:36,037 --> 01:29:38,699
<i>It's Winter. It's Ted Winter, sir.
You better get up here.</i>

975
01:29:47,966 --> 01:29:49,877
Check him. Check him!

976
01:29:50,677 --> 01:29:51,712
Checking vitals.

977
01:29:51,887 --> 01:29:54,674
- I'm not getting a pulse.
- I'm not getting much.

978
01:30:17,871 --> 01:30:19,532
Sit down!

979
01:30:20,790 --> 01:30:23,327
She's yours for 15 minutes
during the flight.

980
01:30:23,501 --> 01:30:25,913
- Give me your hands.
- Then she's the FBI's.

981
01:31:10,507 --> 01:31:12,088
Hey.

982
01:31:13,134 --> 01:31:14,715
Why'd you kill him?

983
01:31:15,011 --> 01:31:16,501
Because somebody had to.

984
01:31:29,985 --> 01:31:31,100
What?

985
01:31:42,122 --> 01:31:45,034
By this, I take it you think
everybody is who they say they are.

986
01:31:46,292 --> 01:31:48,874
You knew something was wrong
the moment Orlov walked in.

987
01:31:49,045 --> 01:31:50,455
So did I.

988
01:31:50,630 --> 01:31:52,916
We just didn't know what it was.

989
01:31:53,383 --> 01:31:56,375
- Winter did.
- Winter?

990
01:31:58,221 --> 01:32:01,429
You expect me to believe that Winter
was gonna launch the missiles

991
01:32:01,599 --> 01:32:03,510
and you saved the world?

992
01:32:05,145 --> 01:32:07,807
I would like you to believe that, yeah.

993
01:32:09,649 --> 01:32:11,230
That's a big accusation.

994
01:32:12,402 --> 01:32:13,733
Well,

995
01:32:14,779 --> 01:32:17,566
he's dead now
so he can't defend himself.

996
01:32:17,782 --> 01:32:21,070
I guess you'll just have to
decide for yourself.

997
01:32:28,209 --> 01:32:30,165
How many more like you are there?

998
01:32:30,754 --> 01:32:32,415
Like me?

999
01:32:33,506 --> 01:32:35,246
None.

1000
01:32:35,925 --> 01:32:37,335
Like him?

1001
01:32:37,510 --> 01:32:39,876
More than you or I can handle alone.

1002
01:32:42,599 --> 01:32:45,261
You really think a trained Soviet agent

1003
01:32:45,435 --> 01:32:50,020
couldn't kill the Russian president
at point-blank range if she wanted to?

1004
01:32:54,152 --> 01:32:56,438
Or you, for that matter.

1005
01:32:57,113 --> 01:32:59,399
I could've killed you at the funeral
and I didn't.

1006
01:32:59,908 --> 01:33:02,445
You surrendered to me
because I gave you no choice.

1007
01:33:02,619 --> 01:33:04,530
You know better.

1008
01:33:05,538 --> 01:33:07,779
I had a choice.

1009
01:33:08,416 --> 01:33:09,576
You know better.

1010
01:33:29,813 --> 01:33:32,054
If I did believe you,

1011
01:33:32,232 --> 01:33:36,020
and I'm not saying for a second
that I do, but if I did,

1012
01:33:37,946 --> 01:33:39,652
nobody else would.

1013
01:33:41,282 --> 01:33:44,490
Well, maybe you can
think of a way around that.

1014
01:33:55,839 --> 01:33:58,376
They took everything from me.

1015
01:34:00,135 --> 01:34:01,921
I'll kill them.

1016
01:34:15,984 --> 01:34:18,350
ETA, four minutes.

1017
01:34:25,368 --> 01:34:26,448
Bullshit!

1018
01:34:38,882 --> 01:34:42,215
We are approaching the Potomac,
heading due south and west.

1019
01:34:47,891 --> 01:34:49,552
Go get them.

1020
01:35:09,913 --> 01:35:10,993
Salt!

1021
01:35:19,672 --> 01:35:23,130
Circle back! Circle back!

1022
01:36:19,482 --> 01:36:22,098
<i>New U.S. President Joseph Steppens
announced today</i>

1023
01:36:22,277 --> 01:36:24,268
<i>that with the death of Natasha Chenkov,</i>

1024
01:36:24,445 --> 01:36:28,154
<i>known in the U.S. as Evelyn Salt,
all elements of the terrorist group</i>

1025
01:36:28,324 --> 01:36:30,656
<i>have been eliminated.
The announcement came</i>

1026
01:36:30,827 --> 01:36:32,692
<i>during his Moscow peacekeeping visit</i>

1027
01:36:32,870 --> 01:36:35,282
<i>where President Steppens paused
to lay flowers</i>

1028
01:36:35,456 --> 01:36:40,075
<i>at the site of the 1974 plane crash
that killed his parents and sister</i>

1029
01:36:40,253 --> 01:36:42,869
