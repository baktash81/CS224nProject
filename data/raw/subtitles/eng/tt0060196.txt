1
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:57,472
You're...

2
00:09:58,556 --> 00:09:59,307
...from Baker?

3
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:13,029
Tell Baker that 
 told him
all that 
 know already.

4
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:14,823
Tell him 
 want to live in peace,
understand?

5
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:17,742
That it's no use
to go on tormenting me!

6
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:20,662

 know nothing at all
about that case of coins.

7
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:21,830
Now that gold has disappeared.

8
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:25,416
But if he'd listened to me,
we could have avoided this altogether.

9
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,836

 went to the Army court.

10
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:29,629
There were no witnesses.

11
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:31,923
They couldn't uncover any more.

12
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:34,968

 can't tell Baker
what happened to the money.

13
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,927
Go back and tell him that!

14
00:10:39,471 --> 00:10:41,932
Word's around you had a visitor...

15
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,602
...and Baker knows it.

16
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:49,356
Name of Jackson.

17
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,405
Jackson was here...

18
00:10:57,948 --> 00:11:00,617
...or Baker's got it all wrong.

19
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,960
He's not wrong.

20
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:14,923
Maybe Baker would like to know
just what you and Jackson had to Say...

21
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:17,341
...about the cash box.

22
00:11:21,262 --> 00:11:24,015
That's not what I'm being paid for.

23
00:11:27,894 --> 00:11:31,981
I'm only interested in
what name Jackson's hiding under now!

24
00:11:35,067 --> 00:11:37,737
Why do you think Jackson
may be assuming another name?

25
00:11:37,904 --> 00:11:40,323

 would have found him already.

26
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:44,327
When 
 start off to find somebody,

 find them.

27
00:11:44,493 --> 00:11:46,704
That's why they pay me.

28
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:54,628
What is Baker paying you?

29
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:59,007
That your family?

30
00:12:08,892 --> 00:12:09,809
Yes.

31
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:13,063
Nice family.

32
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:17,567
What does he pay you for murdering me?

33
00:12:20,654 --> 00:12:22,322
$500.

34
00:12:23,323 --> 00:12:24,907
...to get the name!

35
00:12:31,205 --> 00:12:32,665
The name!

36
00:12:42,216 --> 00:12:43,217
Carson.

37
00:12:43,842 --> 00:12:45,469
Bill Carson.

38
00:12:45,678 --> 00:12:48,430
That's what he calls himself now.

39
00:13:18,711 --> 00:13:21,296
Here's a lot of money: $1,000.

40
00:13:25,425 --> 00:13:27,093
$1,000...

41
00:13:29,678 --> 00:13:31,430
..and some in gold.

42
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,556
That's a tidy sum.

43
00:13:37,601 --> 00:13:39,269
But when I'm paid...

44
00:13:39,978 --> 00:13:41,770
...l always see the job through.

45
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,178
It's you.

46
00:14:56,804 --> 00:14:58,639
Any information?

47
00:15:00,474 --> 00:15:02,101
Too much.

48
00:15:03,644 --> 00:15:06,437
He said quite a bit
that should interest you...

49
00:15:06,604 --> 00:15:09,107
...and one or two things
that interested me.

50
00:15:09,273 --> 00:15:11,149
Such as?

51
00:15:11,608 --> 00:15:14,193
The name Jackson's hiding under is...

52
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,944
...Bill Carson.

53
00:15:18,196 --> 00:15:20,156
That's your bit.

54
00:15:22,784 --> 00:15:24,160
Keep talking.

55
00:15:24,577 --> 00:15:27,162
He also mentioned somethin’
about a certain...

56
00:15:27,329 --> 00:15:30,416
...cash box which just happened
to disappear.

57
00:15:31,542 --> 00:15:32,960
That's my bit.

58
00:15:33,669 --> 00:15:35,003
Anything else?

59
00:15:35,879 --> 00:15:38,215
Not enough for you, huh?

60
00:15:38,424 --> 00:15:40,300
Well, you don't have to worry.

61
00:15:40,467 --> 00:15:42,844
He'll never say anything to anybody again!

62
00:15:44,178 --> 00:15:45,762
Perfect.

63
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:48,265
Here you are.

64
00:15:48,515 --> 00:15:50,225
Here, this is for you.

65
00:15:50,392 --> 00:15:52,184
You did a good job for me.

66
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:54,019
Worth $500!

67
00:15:58,023 --> 00:15:59,899

 almost forgot.

68
00:16:00,066 --> 00:16:02,318
He gave me $1,000.

69
00:16:02,569 --> 00:16:04,904
I think his idea was that 
 kill you.

70
00:16:12,579 --> 00:16:14,664
But you know, the pity is,
when I'm paid...

71
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:17,542
...l always follow my job through.

72
00:16:17,834 --> 00:16:19,586
You know that.

73
00:17:06,174 --> 00:17:08,383
No pistol, amigo.

74
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:10,218
It won't do you any good.

75
00:17:10,384 --> 00:17:11,928
There are three of us.

76
00:17:27,026 --> 00:17:28,027
Hey amigo.

77
00:17:28,611 --> 00:17:33,366
You know that you have a face
beautiful enough to be worth $2,000?

78
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:36,911
Yeah.

79
00:17:38,746 --> 00:17:41,499
But you don't look like
the one who will collect it.

80
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:52,260
A couple of steps back.

81
00:18:46,272 --> 00:18:47,523
Thank you.

82
00:18:57,033 --> 00:18:58,909
How much you worth now?

83
00:18:59,327 --> 00:19:00,619
How much?

84
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:03,121
$2,000!

85
00:19:05,999 --> 00:19:07,667
That's right, $2,000.

86
00:19:08,084 --> 00:19:09,878
Yeah, $2,000.

87
00:19:17,093 --> 00:19:19,179
Hijo de puta que te parié!

88
00:19:19,471 --> 00:19:21,055
You'll pay for this!

89
00:19:21,221 --> 00:19:23,932

 hope you end up in a graveyard...

90
00:19:24,099 --> 00:19:26,684
...with the cholera, and the rabies,
and the plague!

91
00:19:26,851 --> 00:19:30,480
Cut me loose!
Cut me loose, you filthy bastard!

92
00:19:30,647 --> 00:19:31,855
Put me down!

93
00:19:32,022 --> 00:19:34,815

 hope your mother ends up
in a two-dollar whorehouse!

94
00:19:34,982 --> 00:19:37,401
Cut me loose! Cut me loose!

95
00:19:38,485 --> 00:19:40,277
You can still save yourself.

96
00:19:40,444 --> 00:19:43,072
Let me go, and I'll pardon you.

97
00:19:43,322 --> 00:19:44,865
Let me go!

98
00:19:45,949 --> 00:19:48,827
I feel sick. The blood is rushing...

99
00:19:50,287 --> 00:19:51,871
I'm dry.

100
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:54,749
Agua! Water!

101
00:20:01,506 --> 00:20:04,008
You swine! You son of a bitch!

102
00:20:06,177 --> 00:20:08,221
You're brave with a man who's tied up!

103
00:20:08,388 --> 00:20:09,888
Come back!

104
00:20:10,055 --> 00:20:11,931
Come back and fight!

105
00:20:12,932 --> 00:20:14,892
You bastard!

106
00:20:15,851 --> 00:20:17,269
Who the hell is that?

107
00:20:17,436 --> 00:20:19,563
One bastard goes in, another comes out.

108
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:21,273
Cut it out! Cut it out!

109
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,652
I'm an honest farmer!
I'm innocent of any--

110
00:20:27,237 --> 00:20:29,280
So, you're an honest farmer.

111
00:20:29,447 --> 00:20:31,658
You recognize this man?

112
00:20:32,033 --> 00:20:34,035
Yeah, it's you!

113
00:20:35,703 --> 00:20:38,747
Who says so? You can't even read.

114
00:20:39,164 --> 00:20:40,832
Roll it up. Roll it up!

115
00:20:40,998 --> 00:20:43,501
I'll give you a good idea
where you can put it.

116
00:20:43,668 --> 00:20:47,629
To hell with all you sheriffs and deputies
and all who gave birth to you!

117
00:20:47,796 --> 00:20:50,465
Hey, everybody, look! Look!
He's giving him the filthy money!

118
00:20:50,632 --> 00:20:51,633
Judas!

119
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,260
You've sold my hide!

120
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:56,054
But you won't enjoy any of that money,
not a penny.

121
00:20:56,221 --> 00:20:59,141
If there's justice,
that money will go to the undertakers!

122
00:20:59,307 --> 00:21:02,268
Every penny of it.
You know who you are?

123
00:21:02,435 --> 00:21:04,687
You want to know whose son you are?

124
00:21:04,854 --> 00:21:07,148
You don't, 
 do. Everybody does.

125
00:21:07,314 --> 00:21:09,150
You're the son of a thousand fathers!

126
00:21:09,316 --> 00:21:10,776
All bastards like you!

127
00:21:10,943 --> 00:21:13,654
And your mother? Your mother...

128
00:21:13,821 --> 00:21:15,197
You bastard!

129
00:21:16,157 --> 00:21:20,745
Your mother, it's better not to talk
of her. 
 never hurt anybody!

130
00:21:21,078 --> 00:21:24,165
...wanted in 14 counties of this state...

131
00:21:25,249 --> 00:21:30,087
...the condemned is found guilty
of the crimes of murder, armed robbery...

132
00:21:30,713 --> 00:21:34,341
..of citizens, state banks,
and post offices...

133
00:21:34,508 --> 00:21:38,429
...the theft of sacred objects,
arson in a state prison...

134
00:21:38,596 --> 00:21:42,349
..perjury, bigamy,
deserting his wife and children...

135
00:21:43,267 --> 00:21:47,228
..inciting prostitution,
kidnapping, extortion...

136
00:21:47,395 --> 00:21:50,398
.. receiving stolen goods,
selling stolen goods...

137
00:21:50,565 --> 00:21:55,445
...passing counterfeit money,
and contrary to the laws of this state...

138
00:21:55,653 --> 00:21:58,656
..the condemned is guilty of using...

139
00:22:00,074 --> 00:22:03,619
Therefore, according to
the powers vested in us...

140
00:22:04,286 --> 00:22:07,122
..we sentence the accused
here before us...

141
00:22:07,289 --> 00:22:10,959
...Tuco Benedicto Pacifico
Juan Maria Ramirez...

142
00:22:11,126 --> 00:22:12,294
...Known as the "Rat"...

143
00:22:12,461 --> 00:22:15,380
..and any other aliases he might have...

144
00:22:16,256 --> 00:22:18,008
..to hang by the neck until dead.

145
00:22:18,175 --> 00:22:21,512
May God have mercy on his soul.
Proceed!

146
00:22:47,412 --> 00:22:49,498
Five for you.

147
00:22:49,873 --> 00:22:52,543
One, two, three, four...

148
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:54,336
_..five for me.

149
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,964
Five for you...

150
00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:00,675
_...and five for me.

151
00:23:01,008 --> 00:23:03,010
Know how much you're worth now?

152
00:23:03,177 --> 00:23:05,053
No, how much?

153
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,720
$3,000!

154
00:23:10,473 --> 00:23:13,268
There are two kinds of people
in the world, my friend.

155
00:23:13,434 --> 00:23:14,602
Those with a rope around their neck...

156
00:23:14,769 --> 00:23:17,397
...and the people who have the job
of doing the cutting.

157
00:23:17,564 --> 00:23:20,692
Listen, the neck at the end
of the rope is mine!

158
00:23:20,859 --> 00:23:22,861

 run the risks.

159
00:23:23,278 --> 00:23:26,739
So, the next time, 
 want more than half!

160
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:29,325
You may run the risks, my friend, but...

161
00:23:29,492 --> 00:23:31,744
...1 do the cutting.

162
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:35,706
If we cut down my percentage...

163
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,500
cigar?

164
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:43,630
...It might interfere with my aim.

165
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:48,844
But if you miss,
you had better miss very well.

166
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:52,639
Whoever double-crosses me
and leaves me alive...

167
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:55,934
...he understands nothing about Tuco.

168
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:58,519
Nothing!

169
00:24:02,064 --> 00:24:04,483
Wanted in 15 counties of this state...

170
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:08,446
...the condemned, standing before us...
sitting before us...

171
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:11,824
...Tuco Benedicto Pacifico
Juan Maria Ramirez...

172
00:24:11,991 --> 00:24:14,200
...has been found guilty
by the Third District Circuit Court...

173
00:24:14,367 --> 00:24:18,120
...Of the following crimes: murder,
assaulting a justice of the peace...

174
00:24:18,287 --> 00:24:20,664
...raping a virgin of the white race...

175
00:24:20,831 --> 00:24:24,710
...and statutory rape
of a minor of the black race...

176
00:24:25,085 --> 00:24:28,630
...Of derailing a train
in order to rob the passengers....

177
00:24:34,302 --> 00:24:36,054
What'd you find out, Shorty?

178
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:38,014
If you ask me, it seems like a book!

179
00:24:38,181 --> 00:24:42,310
An armed unit, escorting a cash box
of gold coins, meets a Yankee ambush...

180
00:24:42,477 --> 00:24:44,854
..and only three of them are saved.

181
00:24:45,021 --> 00:24:47,357
Stevens, Baker, and Jackson.

182
00:24:47,523 --> 00:24:49,859
The thing that wasn't saved, though,
was the coins.

183
00:24:50,026 --> 00:24:52,737
But then the Army decides, of course,
it ought to hold a hearing...

184
00:24:52,904 --> 00:24:53,947
..and Jackson's acquitted.

185
00:24:54,113 --> 00:24:56,950
He disappears, and becomes Bill Carson.

186
00:24:57,116 --> 00:24:58,034

 know his name.

187
00:24:58,201 --> 00:25:01,245
But you don't know
just who you're lookin’ for, and 
 do!

188
00:25:01,412 --> 00:25:05,375
And when he's found,
I'd be scared to be put in his shoes!

189
00:25:07,794 --> 00:25:10,672
- Where is Carson?
- All 
 Know is Carson re-enlisted.

190
00:25:10,838 --> 00:25:12,214
The poor guy's minus an eye.

191
00:25:12,381 --> 00:25:14,424
He lives with a girl called Maria,
who'll tell you.

192
00:25:14,591 --> 00:25:16,968
She's a fresh young whore
in the territory.

193
00:25:17,134 --> 00:25:18,052
Where is she?

194
00:25:18,219 --> 00:25:22,098
Now, what's the name of that town?
It's someplace very near...

195
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,435
Santa Ana.

196
00:25:28,854 --> 00:25:31,315
Adios, half-soldier.

197
00:25:36,404 --> 00:25:37,612
Hand me down a whiskey!

198
00:25:49,207 --> 00:25:52,460
Glad they got him.
A man guilty of all those crimes!

199
00:25:52,836 --> 00:25:54,671
People with ropes around their necks
don't always hang.

200
00:25:54,838 --> 00:25:57,257
What do you mean?

201
00:25:58,508 --> 00:26:02,303
Even a filthy beggar like that
has a protecting angel.

202
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:12,355
A golden-haired angel watches over him.

203
00:26:12,522 --> 00:26:15,191
Of all these crimes, the accused
has made a full, spontaneous confession.

204
00:26:16,483 --> 00:26:20,195
Therefore, we condemn him
to be hung by the neck until dead.

205
00:26:20,362 --> 00:26:23,615
May the Lord have mercy on his soul.
Proceed.

206
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:40,799
Let's get the hell out of here!

207
00:27:12,289 --> 00:27:14,833
What are you saying?
Anybody can miss a shot?

208
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,835
Nobody misses
when I'm at the end of the rope!

209
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:20,506
You never had a rope around your neck.
Well, I'm going to tell you something.

210
00:27:20,672 --> 00:27:25,010
When that rope starts to pull tight,
you can feel the devil bite your ass!

211
00:27:27,846 --> 00:27:29,806
Yeah, you're right.

212
00:27:30,598 --> 00:27:32,390
It's getting tougher.

213
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:35,142
The way 
 figure...

214
00:27:35,309 --> 00:27:39,438
...there's really not too much future
with a sawed-off runt like you.

215
00:27:39,605 --> 00:27:40,940
What do you mean?

216
00:27:41,107 --> 00:27:45,194
‘Cause 
 don't think you'll ever
be worth more than $3,000.

217
00:27:45,694 --> 00:27:47,780
What do you mean?

218
00:27:47,947 --> 00:27:51,075
I mean, our partnership is untied.

219
00:27:51,867 --> 00:27:53,786
Oh no, not you.

220
00:27:53,953 --> 00:27:55,788
You remain tied.

221
00:27:55,955 --> 00:27:58,791
I'll keep the money,
and you can have the rope.

222
00:27:58,958 --> 00:28:03,045
You filthy, double-crossing bastard!
Of all the stinking, dirty tricks--

223
00:28:03,212 --> 00:28:06,005
The way back to town is only 70 miles.

224
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:11,052
If you save your breath,

 feel a man like you could manage it.

225
00:28:11,219 --> 00:28:12,345
Adios.

226
00:28:12,512 --> 00:28:15,473
You filthy bastard! Come here!

227
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:18,768
Come here! Cut this rope off!
Get off that horse!

228
00:28:18,935 --> 00:28:20,979
Get off that horse! You filthy coward!

229
00:28:21,146 --> 00:28:22,230
If 
 ever catch you...

230
00:28:22,397 --> 00:28:24,440
...I'll rip your heart out and eat it!

231
00:28:24,607 --> 00:28:28,360
I'll skin you alive!
I'll hang you up by your tongue.

232
00:28:29,778 --> 00:28:32,531
Mil kill you! Fl kill you!

233
00:28:34,241 --> 00:28:38,745
Such ingratitude, after all the times
I've saved your life.

234
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:47,588
You wouldn't leave me here...

235
00:28:47,754 --> 00:28:49,173
Come back!

236
00:28:49,339 --> 00:28:51,800
Wait! Listen, Blondie!

237
00:28:53,302 --> 00:28:55,470
Hijo de una gran puta!

238
00:29:33,508 --> 00:29:35,468
You filthy rats!

239
00:29:51,817 --> 00:29:53,319
Maria.

240
00:30:00,243 --> 00:30:02,245
Is that you, Bill?

241
00:30:14,382 --> 00:30:16,258
Who are you?

242
00:30:16,424 --> 00:30:18,384
What do you want with me?

243
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:21,428
Go on talking about Bill Carson.

244
00:30:21,887 --> 00:30:24,264
I don't know him.

245
00:30:24,889 --> 00:30:28,184
You were calling to him in the dark!

246
00:30:31,813 --> 00:30:32,897
Where is he?

247
00:30:33,064 --> 00:30:35,692
What are you gonna do?

248
00:30:36,734 --> 00:30:39,404
I'll ask the questions!

249
00:30:40,822 --> 00:30:42,782
Where is he?

250
00:30:49,831 --> 00:30:51,291
Where is he?

251
00:30:59,882 --> 00:31:02,051
That's enough!

252
00:31:03,052 --> 00:31:04,512
I don't know where he is.

253
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:08,141
He packed his things ten days ago,
and went away with his unit.

254
00:31:08,308 --> 00:31:09,767
They all left.

255
00:31:09,934 --> 00:31:12,270
Which company? Where'd he go?

256
00:31:16,149 --> 00:31:19,110
Third Cavalry, General Sibley.

257
00:31:19,819 --> 00:31:22,030
They left for Santa Fe.

258
00:31:22,196 --> 00:31:24,866
That's all 
 know. 
 swear!

259
00:32:57,166 --> 00:33:00,253
I'm very sorry, but the store is closing.

260
00:33:38,082 --> 00:33:40,376
Revolvers?

261
00:33:45,465 --> 00:33:47,550
Revolvers!

262
00:33:48,259 --> 00:33:51,471
Here's where 
 keep the best ones.

263
00:33:56,476 --> 00:33:59,353
Remington, Colt, Farroute...

264
00:34:00,645 --> 00:34:03,606
.. smith Wesson, Colt, from the Navy...

265
00:34:04,982 --> 00:34:08,277
Joslyn, another Remington, and this--

266
00:34:08,736 --> 00:34:10,571
That's enough.

267
00:34:53,322 --> 00:34:55,407
Cartridges.

268
00:35:03,666 --> 00:35:06,794
- You wanna try the pistol, just step--
- Let's go.

269
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:32,004
Cartridge.

270
00:36:39,803 --> 00:36:40,846
How much?

271
00:36:41,013 --> 00:36:42,848
$20.

272
00:36:49,772 --> 00:36:51,607
$50.

273
00:36:52,899 --> 00:36:54,691
How much?

274
00:36:55,901 --> 00:36:57,903
$100.

275
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:03,617
$200. It's all I've got!

276
00:37:24,763 --> 00:37:25,639
Come here!

277
00:37:56,169 --> 00:37:57,921
This morning 
 heard the whole thing.

278
00:37:58,088 --> 00:38:00,215
They say Colonel Canby's closing in
with his Northerners...

279
00:38:00,382 --> 00:38:03,093
..and no later than tomorrow
that they'll be in the city.

280
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:06,138
That's why these Southerners
are getting out!

281
00:38:06,304 --> 00:38:10,517
You see, as soon as these cowards hear
there are blue shirts around, they run.

282
00:38:10,684 --> 00:38:13,520
- These rebels have no will to fight!
- Poor things.

283
00:38:13,687 --> 00:38:15,147
They'll soon be finished.

284
00:38:15,313 --> 00:38:16,397
We get rid of these bastards...

285
00:38:16,564 --> 00:38:18,941
...then we begin making money
on those Yankees.

286
00:38:19,108 --> 00:38:23,279
They carry gold, not paper dollars.
And they're going to beat the South.

287
00:38:24,447 --> 00:38:27,616
Look, see that one with the white beard
sitting in the wagon?

288
00:38:27,783 --> 00:38:31,495
General Sibley. He looks dead.
He's finally getting out of our hair.

289
00:38:31,662 --> 00:38:34,582
Hooray for Dixie!
Hooray, hooray for Dixie!

290
00:38:40,337 --> 00:38:42,840
Where's the owner of that horse?

291
00:38:43,007 --> 00:38:44,133
Please, mister, sir...

292
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:46,260
-...a bad heart condition....
- Where?

293
00:38:46,427 --> 00:38:48,804
The war has frightened me already.

294
00:38:49,138 --> 00:38:51,515
I'm looking for the owner of that horse.

295
00:38:51,682 --> 00:38:54,851
He's tall, blond, he smokes a cigar,
and he's a pig!

296
00:38:55,268 --> 00:38:56,519
Where is he now?!

297
00:38:56,686 --> 00:38:59,481
You leave him be! He doesn't know
who rides every horse!

298
00:38:59,731 --> 00:39:02,524
You stay quiet, old hen!

299
00:39:03,984 --> 00:39:07,361
Upstairs. Upstairs, in Room 4, señor.

300
00:39:13,034 --> 00:39:14,534
Hear that?

301
00:39:19,956 --> 00:39:22,959
You rotten criminals, how dare you?!

302
00:42:10,210 --> 00:42:12,002
Your spurs.

303
00:42:23,806 --> 00:42:26,475
There are two kinds of spurs, my friend.

304
00:42:26,642 --> 00:42:29,435
Those that come in by the door...

305
00:42:29,602 --> 00:42:32,021
..and those that come in by the window.

306
00:42:32,188 --> 00:42:34,524
Take off that pistol belt.

307
00:42:41,864 --> 00:42:43,824
It's empty.

308
00:42:45,951 --> 00:42:47,953
Mine isn't.

309
00:42:54,001 --> 00:42:57,962
Even when Judas hanged himself,
there was a storm, too.

310
00:43:01,339 --> 00:43:03,758
That could be cannon fire.

311
00:43:03,925 --> 00:43:07,470
Cannon fire or storm,
it's all the same to you!

312
00:43:09,764 --> 00:43:12,559
You ever see this before, my friend?

313
00:43:21,693 --> 00:43:24,320
Throw it over the roof beam.

314
00:43:26,156 --> 00:43:28,199
That's it.

315
00:43:39,210 --> 00:43:41,337
And get on that!

316
00:43:51,056 --> 00:43:52,766
That's right.

317
00:43:52,932 --> 00:43:55,351
Now, make sure the rope is tight!

318
00:43:55,643 --> 00:43:58,604
It's got to hold the weight of a pig!

319
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:07,571
Now, put the rope around your neck!

320
00:44:14,203 --> 00:44:16,246
Yes, very good.

321
00:44:17,247 --> 00:44:19,249
It's too big for your neck?

322
00:44:19,416 --> 00:44:21,251
We'll fix that right away.

323
00:44:21,418 --> 00:44:23,002

 have another system.

324
00:44:23,169 --> 00:44:25,922
A little different than yours.

325
00:44:26,172 --> 00:44:28,132
I don't shoot the rope.

326
00:44:28,299 --> 00:44:30,593

 shoot the legs off the stool!

327
00:44:35,014 --> 00:44:36,682
Adios.

328
00:47:38,197 --> 00:47:41,742
... guilty of the following crimes:
horse theft...

329
00:48:00,136 --> 00:48:02,263
And Shorty?

330
00:48:25,745 --> 00:48:27,872
Sorry, Shorty!

331
00:48:28,706 --> 00:48:31,167
Move, come on, let's go!

332
00:48:55,649 --> 00:48:58,903
I don't know. As soon as 
 hit
the desert, I'm thirsty.

333
00:48:59,153 --> 00:49:00,279
Burns, huh?

334
00:49:00,446 --> 00:49:04,158
They say people with fair skin
can't take too much.

335
00:49:28,474 --> 00:49:31,811
Like that, you won't
have to carry so much.

336
00:49:33,145 --> 00:49:35,105
Where are we going?

337
00:49:35,522 --> 00:49:36,730
Where?

338
00:49:36,897 --> 00:49:39,233
Where I'm going, amigo.

339
00:49:39,983 --> 00:49:41,485
Over that way.

340
00:49:41,652 --> 00:49:45,072
Another 100 miles
of beautiful sunbaked sand.

341
00:49:45,864 --> 00:49:48,200
Even the armies are afraid
to march through there.

342
00:49:48,367 --> 00:49:50,576
Sibley's men are retreating up there.

343
00:49:50,743 --> 00:49:53,454
Canby’s men are coming here...

344
00:49:54,038 --> 00:49:57,458
...but no one will set foot
in this hell...

345
00:49:58,376 --> 00:50:00,837
..except you and me.

346
00:50:02,337 --> 00:50:05,549
One hundred miles. That's a nice walk.

347
00:50:08,009 --> 00:50:11,138
What was it you told me the last time?

348
00:50:12,597 --> 00:50:16,810
“If you save your breath,

 feel a man like you could manage it.”

349
00:50:18,602 --> 00:50:21,605
And if you won't manage it, you'll die.

350
00:50:21,772 --> 00:50:23,274
Only slowly.

351
00:50:24,358 --> 00:50:26,819
Very slowly, old friend.

352
00:50:32,116 --> 00:50:35,035
After you, please. Start walking.

353
00:52:31,485 --> 00:52:33,571
Taking a rest?

354
00:52:34,029 --> 00:52:38,409
Come on, Blondie, we don't have
very far to go. Only 70 miles.

355
00:52:39,909 --> 00:52:43,496
Only eight and a half hours more
before sunset.

356
00:52:43,663 --> 00:52:45,957
That's not too bad.

357
00:52:47,041 --> 00:52:48,835
Come on!

358
00:54:52,083 --> 00:54:54,043
And so, Blondie...

359
00:54:56,295 --> 00:54:58,339
.. It's goodbye.

360
00:58:44,565 --> 00:58:48,194
$200,000 in gold. It's yours.
Just get me water!

361
00:58:53,532 --> 00:58:55,660
What's that you say?

362
00:58:55,826 --> 00:58:57,328
Who the hell are you?

363
00:58:59,705 --> 00:59:02,082
My name's Bill Carson now.

364
00:59:02,999 --> 00:59:04,583
Surprise attack.

365
00:59:06,418 --> 00:59:07,294
All dead.

366
00:59:07,461 --> 00:59:10,506
My name is Jackson. Not Carson.

367
00:59:10,881 --> 00:59:12,716
Yeah, yeah, glad to meet you, Carson.

368
00:59:12,883 --> 00:59:16,387
I'm Lincoln's grandfather.
What was that you said about the dollars?

369
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:18,597
$200,000, all mine.

370
00:59:19,848 --> 00:59:22,433
Was the Third Cavalry's.

371
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:24,978
Baker has nothing.

372
00:59:25,561 --> 00:59:26,688
The gold...

373
00:59:26,854 --> 00:59:29,774

 hid the gold. The gold is safe!

374
00:59:30,525 --> 00:59:32,401
Where? Here?

375
00:59:33,693 --> 00:59:35,444
Talk!

376
00:59:35,861 --> 00:59:37,905
In the cemetery.

377
00:59:38,072 --> 00:59:40,032
Which cemetery?

378
00:59:41,075 --> 00:59:43,369
On Sad Hill.

379
00:59:43,536 --> 00:59:45,328
There's a grave by the...

380
00:59:46,162 --> 00:59:47,622
Which grave?

381
00:59:47,789 --> 00:59:50,166
Have a name? Have a number?

382
00:59:50,333 --> 00:59:52,669
Come on, you dummy, talk!

383
00:59:54,295 --> 00:59:56,548
There's no number.

384
00:59:57,007 --> 00:59:58,507
There's a name.

385
00:59:59,675 --> 01:00:01,884
It's written.

386
01:00:08,474 --> 01:00:09,766
Water!

387
01:00:12,561 --> 01:00:15,313
You talk first, eh?
I'll give you the water later!

388
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:17,148
Sad Hill Cemetery, okay?

389
01:00:17,314 --> 01:00:18,482
In a grave, okay.

390
01:00:18,649 --> 01:00:21,152
But it must have
a name or a number on it.

391
01:00:21,318 --> 01:00:24,279
There must be 1,000, 5,000, you...!

392
01:00:28,158 --> 01:00:29,993
Don't die.

393
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:32,454
Don't die! I'll get you water!

394
01:00:32,620 --> 01:00:35,915
Stay there.
Don't move, I'll get you water.

395
01:00:36,082 --> 01:00:38,418
Don't die until later!

396
01:01:04,152 --> 01:01:05,444
Get away from there!

397
01:01:11,991 --> 01:01:13,785
He's dead.

398
01:01:17,330 --> 01:01:19,122
Mil kill you!

399
01:01:21,541 --> 01:01:24,753
If you do that, you'll always be poor.

400
01:01:25,837 --> 01:01:29,049
Just like the greasy rat that you are.

401
01:01:29,466 --> 01:01:31,551
If 
 were you, I'd...

402
01:01:31,718 --> 01:01:33,302
...keep me alive.

403
01:01:33,469 --> 01:01:35,805
What did he tell you?

404
01:01:36,972 --> 01:01:38,140
A name.

405
01:01:39,350 --> 01:01:41,185
Name on a grave.

406
01:01:41,435 --> 01:01:43,145
What name?

407
01:01:56,867 --> 01:01:58,953
Blondie, don't die.

408
01:02:00,037 --> 01:02:02,498
Don't die! I'm your friend.

409
01:02:02,748 --> 01:02:06,335
Please don't die. Please! I'm your friend!

410
01:02:09,463 --> 01:02:11,590
lil help you. I'll help you!

411
01:02:11,757 --> 01:02:14,635
Don't move. I'll be right back.
I'll get the water.

412
01:02:14,802 --> 01:02:17,221
Don't die like that pig.

413
01:02:18,764 --> 01:02:20,348
Water, Blondie?

414
01:02:20,515 --> 01:02:22,475
Don't drink! It's no good for you.

415
01:02:22,642 --> 01:02:24,434
Feel better?

416
01:02:24,601 --> 01:02:28,272
Blondie, what's the matter?
Please don't die!

417
01:02:57,009 --> 01:02:58,260
I've got a very sick man here.

418
01:02:58,427 --> 01:02:59,845
But we have no more beds here.

419
01:03:00,012 --> 01:03:02,347
Let him have yours!

420
01:03:07,561 --> 01:03:09,813
- Where is Pablo Ramirez?
- Padre Ramirez.

421
01:03:09,980 --> 01:03:11,607
He is away at the moment.

422
01:03:11,857 --> 01:03:14,193
He should be back any day now.

423
01:03:14,359 --> 01:03:18,739
It doesn't matter. For the moment,
we'll take very good care of my friend.

424
01:03:18,906 --> 01:03:20,365
May God be praised.

425
01:03:20,532 --> 01:03:21,658
In case you didn't know it...

426
01:03:21,825 --> 01:03:25,662
...God is on our side, too.
Because He hates the Yanks.

427
01:03:27,372 --> 01:03:28,748
Father, is he still breathing?

428
01:03:28,915 --> 01:03:31,000
Yes, of course.

429
01:03:31,667 --> 01:03:33,586
You're heavy.

430
01:04:15,419 --> 01:04:18,380
All right, put a fresh bandage on him.

431
01:04:19,339 --> 01:04:21,591
Put him in my cell.

432
01:04:26,596 --> 01:04:28,973
Out, soldier. Out you go, come on.

433
01:04:29,139 --> 01:04:33,143
Look out for him, please.
He's like a brother to me!

434
01:04:52,121 --> 01:04:54,914
Father, did he speak?
Did he say anything?

435
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:27,905
Did he ask for me?
Did he speak about anything?

436
01:05:28,072 --> 01:05:30,742
No, he hasn't spoken as yet.
But you mustn't worry.

437
01:05:30,908 --> 01:05:34,746
He's both young and strong.
That's what's kept him going until now.

438
01:05:34,912 --> 01:05:37,582
He should regain his strength
in a very short time.

439
01:05:37,749 --> 01:05:41,961
Thank you, Father. You don't know
how much this boy's life means to me!

440
01:07:00,706 --> 01:07:04,459
The old Father tells me
you'll be up and around in a few days.

441
01:07:04,626 --> 01:07:08,003
You're very lucky to have me
so close when it happened.

442
01:07:08,337 --> 01:07:10,756
Think, if you'd been on your own.

443
01:07:13,092 --> 01:07:14,635
I mean, when...

444
01:07:14,802 --> 01:07:17,221
...when one is ill...

445
01:07:17,555 --> 01:07:21,016
...It's good to have somebody close by,
friends or relations.

446
01:07:23,018 --> 01:07:24,520
Do you...

447
01:07:24,687 --> 01:07:26,856
...you have parents, Blondie?

448
01:07:27,314 --> 01:07:28,774
A mother?

449
01:07:28,941 --> 01:07:31,152
Not even a mother.

450
01:07:31,902 --> 01:07:33,194
No one.

451
01:07:34,070 --> 01:07:36,906
You're all alone, huh? Like me, Blondie.

452
01:07:37,574 --> 01:07:40,285
We're all alone in the world.

453
01:07:40,452 --> 01:07:42,370

 have you, you have me.

454
01:07:45,457 --> 01:07:47,792
Only for a little while, 
 mean.

455
01:07:48,168 --> 01:07:50,128
It had to happen now.

456
01:07:50,795 --> 01:07:53,214
What a dirty rotten trick of fate!

457
01:07:53,381 --> 01:07:56,468
We could have all that money
in our hands.

458
01:08:02,849 --> 01:08:05,393
I must tell you the truth, Blondie.

459
01:08:05,560 --> 01:08:08,729
In my place, you would do the same thing.

460
01:08:10,189 --> 01:08:12,441
It's all over for you now.

461
01:08:13,150 --> 01:08:16,111
There's nothing anyone can do anymore.

462
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:22,534
It's my fault! Mine, mine!

463
01:08:35,172 --> 01:08:39,009
I'll tell you one thing, Blondie.
If 
 knew that my last hour had come...

464
01:08:39,176 --> 01:08:43,597
...
 swear, in my place, in your place,

 would do the same thing.

465
01:08:44,805 --> 01:08:48,059

 would tell about the gold.
Yes, yes 
 would!

466
01:08:48,226 --> 01:08:50,561

 would tell the name on the grave.

467
01:08:50,728 --> 01:08:53,356
After all, what good is the money to you
if you're dead?

468
01:08:53,523 --> 01:08:55,483
I know the name of the cemetery.

469
01:08:55,650 --> 01:08:58,694
But you know how many graves
there are there?

470
01:08:58,861 --> 01:08:59,987
Please.

471
01:09:02,114 --> 01:09:04,074
Please, have a little.

472
01:09:07,369 --> 01:09:10,330
Coffee? Please tell me the name.

473
01:09:12,415 --> 01:09:13,959
On the grave.

474
01:09:14,793 --> 01:09:17,796
If 
 get my hands on the $200,000...

475
01:09:19,631 --> 01:09:22,216
...I'll always honor your memory.

476
01:09:22,716 --> 01:09:25,844

 swear it! I'll always honor your memory!

477
01:09:28,889 --> 01:09:30,849
Come closer.

478
01:09:35,896 --> 01:09:36,980
Tell me.

479
01:09:42,569 --> 01:09:44,862
I'll sleep better...

480
01:09:46,154 --> 01:09:48,739
...knowing my good friend...

481
01:09:48,990 --> 01:09:50,950
..1S by my side...

482
01:09:51,117 --> 01:09:52,617
...to protect me.

483
01:10:04,129 --> 01:10:06,464
“Tuco, water. Please, water.”

484
01:10:06,798 --> 01:10:10,343
But if 
 get that name from you,
I'll give you water!

485
01:10:17,267 --> 01:10:20,060
All right, you dirty skunk,
get your ass off the bed!

486
01:10:20,227 --> 01:10:22,271
Come on, come on, the party's over.

487
01:10:22,438 --> 01:10:24,148
The wagon is all ready to go.

488
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:26,316
From the way the wounded
are pouring into this place...

489
01:10:26,482 --> 01:10:29,485
...we better get the hell out of here
before we get caught up in the war.

490
01:10:29,652 --> 01:10:32,363
Tuco, Father Ramirez is back.

491
01:10:32,530 --> 01:10:36,659
This is something I have to look into.
It'll only take a minute. Get moving.

492
01:10:36,826 --> 01:10:38,453
- Where? This way?
- Yes.

493
01:10:56,262 --> 01:10:57,346
Hey, Pablo!

494
01:11:05,854 --> 01:11:08,106
Don't you recognize me?

495
01:11:09,650 --> 01:11:11,401
It's me, Tuco!

496
01:11:12,361 --> 01:11:14,696
Let me embrace you.

497
01:11:17,783 --> 01:11:20,702
I don't know the right thing!

498
01:11:24,748 --> 01:11:27,042

 was just passing by here.

 said to myself...

499
01:11:27,250 --> 01:11:31,088
...l wonder if my brother
remembers his brother.

500
01:11:33,507 --> 01:11:35,342
Did 
 do wrong?

501
01:11:36,677 --> 01:11:39,221
It doesn't matter. I'm very happy.

502
01:11:39,388 --> 01:11:41,640
You've seen me, Tuco.

503
01:11:43,516 --> 01:11:46,101
Yeah, well, I'm very glad 
 came.

504
01:11:51,940 --> 01:11:54,901
Oh, my uniform. It's a long story.

505
01:11:56,236 --> 01:11:59,531
Let's talk about you. It's more important.

506
01:11:59,864 --> 01:12:01,700
You look very well.

507
01:12:02,242 --> 01:12:04,911
A bit thin, perhaps, but...

508
01:12:06,037 --> 01:12:08,998
...you always were thin, eh Pablito?

509
01:12:11,668 --> 01:12:13,753
What about our parents?

510
01:12:14,963 --> 01:12:17,257
Only now do you think of them?

511
01:12:18,425 --> 01:12:20,468
To begin after nine years?

512
01:12:22,637 --> 01:12:24,513
Nine years?

513
01:12:25,805 --> 01:12:27,265
So it's nine years.

514
01:12:30,810 --> 01:12:33,855
Our mother has been dead a long time now.

515
01:12:35,022 --> 01:12:38,317
Our father died only a few days ago.

516
01:12:38,484 --> 01:12:40,360
That's why 
 was away.

517
01:12:42,612 --> 01:12:44,948
He asked for you to be there.

518
01:12:45,115 --> 01:12:47,409
But there was only me.

519
01:12:54,249 --> 01:12:56,209
And you?

520
01:12:56,376 --> 01:12:59,463
Outside of evil,
what else have you managed to do?

521
01:13:00,839 --> 01:13:04,342
It seems to me
you once had a wife someplace.

522
01:13:06,762 --> 01:13:08,764
Not one, lots of them!

523
01:13:08,930 --> 01:13:11,558
One here, one there,
wherever 
 found them.

524
01:13:12,726 --> 01:13:15,562
Go on, preach me a sermon, Pablo.

525
01:13:17,272 --> 01:13:19,608
What good would that be?

526
01:13:20,859 --> 01:13:23,278
Just keep on the way you're going.

527
01:13:23,445 --> 01:13:24,863
Go away.

528
01:13:26,281 --> 01:13:27,449
The Lord have mercy on your soul.

529
01:13:27,616 --> 01:13:31,119
I'll go, I'll go. While I'm waiting
for the Lord to remember me...

530
01:13:31,286 --> 01:13:34,831
.. 
, Tuco Ramirez,
brother of Brother Ramirez...

531
01:13:34,998 --> 01:13:36,917
...will tell you something.

532
01:13:37,083 --> 01:13:39,002
You think you're better than 
 am.

533
01:13:39,169 --> 01:13:41,713
Where we came from,
if one did not want to die of poverty...

534
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:44,174
...one became a priest or a bandit!

535
01:13:44,341 --> 01:13:46,843
You chose your way, 
 chose mine.

536
01:13:47,010 --> 01:13:48,637
Mine was harder.

537
01:13:48,804 --> 01:13:50,472
You talk of our mother and father.

538
01:13:50,639 --> 01:13:52,682
You remember when you left
to become a priest.

539
01:13:52,849 --> 01:13:54,141
I stayed behind!

540
01:13:54,308 --> 01:13:58,061

 must have been ten, twelve.
I don't remember which, but 
 stayed.

541
01:13:58,228 --> 01:14:00,522
I tried, but it was no good.

542
01:14:00,688 --> 01:14:02,732
Now 
 am going to tell you something.

543
01:14:02,899 --> 01:14:04,359
You became a priest because you were...

544
01:14:04,526 --> 01:14:07,487
...too much of a coward to do what 
 do!

545
01:14:38,017 --> 01:14:40,270
Please, forgive me, brother.

546
01:15:09,966 --> 01:15:11,634
My belly's full.

547
01:15:13,261 --> 01:15:15,221
Nice guy, my brother.

548
01:15:15,555 --> 01:15:17,891
I didn't tell you
my brother was in charge here.

549
01:15:18,057 --> 01:15:20,143
Everything, like the pope almost.

550
01:15:20,310 --> 01:15:22,145
He's in charge in Rome.

551
01:15:22,312 --> 01:15:25,732
My brother, he says to me:
"Stay, brother, don't go home."

552
01:15:25,899 --> 01:15:27,567
"We never see each other."

553
01:15:27,734 --> 01:15:32,071
“Here, there's plenty to eat and drink.
Bring your friend, too."

554
01:15:32,238 --> 01:15:34,490
Whenever we see each other,
he never lets me go.

555
01:15:34,657 --> 01:15:36,951
It's always the same story.

556
01:15:37,118 --> 01:15:39,746
My brother, he's crazy about me.

557
01:15:43,583 --> 01:15:44,417
That's so.

558
01:15:44,584 --> 01:15:47,879
Even a tramp like me,
no matter what happens...

559
01:15:48,713 --> 01:15:54,218
...
 know there's a brother somewhere
who will never refuse me a bowl of soup.

560
01:15:55,594 --> 01:15:57,012
Sure.

561
01:15:58,388 --> 01:16:02,351
Well, after a meal,
there's nothing like a good cigar.

562
01:17:10,335 --> 01:17:11,795
Wake up, you!

563
01:17:12,170 --> 01:17:13,546
The troops are coming!

564
01:17:13,713 --> 01:17:15,715
Blue or gray?

565
01:17:22,470 --> 01:17:26,725
They're gray like us. Let's say "hello"
to them and then get going.

566
01:17:26,891 --> 01:17:30,060
Hurrah for the Confederacy! Hurrah!

567
01:17:30,227 --> 01:17:32,229
Down with General Grant!

568
01:17:32,396 --> 01:17:35,189
Hurrah for General...what's his name?

569
01:17:35,356 --> 01:17:36,357
Lee!

570
01:17:39,444 --> 01:17:42,905
God is with us
because He hates the Yanks, too!

571
01:17:44,657 --> 01:17:48,453
God is not on our side
"cause He hates idiots also.

572
01:18:08,306 --> 01:18:09,890
Prisoners of war...

573
01:18:10,057 --> 01:18:11,725
forward...

574
01:18:12,601 --> 01:18:13,809
...march!

575
01:19:16,580 --> 01:19:18,874
Form a single file.

576
01:20:18,642 --> 01:20:20,226
Robert Clark.

577
01:20:20,393 --> 01:20:21,603
Present.

578
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:23,730
Sam Richmond.

579
01:20:23,897 --> 01:20:25,105
Present.

580
01:20:28,233 --> 01:20:29,693
Bill Carson.

581
01:20:35,991 --> 01:20:37,993

 said Bill Carson!

582
01:20:38,785 --> 01:20:41,705
Hey, Blondie, isn't that Angel Eyes?

583
01:20:42,206 --> 01:20:45,459
All right, what's he doing? Sleeping?!

584
01:20:48,337 --> 01:20:51,506
Yeah, and you better be Bill Carson.

585
01:20:54,509 --> 01:20:55,928
That's me!

586
01:21:04,228 --> 01:21:06,396
Please, Carson.

587
01:21:07,564 --> 01:21:09,316
Answer, "Present"!

588
01:21:10,943 --> 01:21:13,111
What are you, deaf?

589
01:21:18,784 --> 01:21:21,745
Now, suppose you say "present," Carson.

590
01:21:23,163 --> 01:21:25,999

 like big fat men like you.

591
01:21:26,166 --> 01:21:28,460
When they fall, they make more noise.

592
01:21:28,627 --> 01:21:31,171
And sometimes they never get up.

593
01:21:32,089 --> 01:21:33,965
Wallace...

594
01:21:35,465 --> 01:21:37,217
...that's enough.

595
01:21:39,844 --> 01:21:41,680
Sergeant!

596
01:21:43,223 --> 01:21:46,226
The captain wants to see you right away.

597
01:21:49,145 --> 01:21:51,982
Be sure these two get good treatment.

598
01:22:02,075 --> 01:22:05,704
Hey, Blondie, did you hear that?
Good treatment!

599
01:22:12,627 --> 01:22:15,046
For the last time, sergeant...

600
01:22:15,213 --> 01:22:16,214
.../'m telling you...

601
01:22:16,381 --> 01:22:19,426
...l want the prisoners
treated as prisoners.

602
01:22:20,176 --> 01:22:21,970
No more brutality!

603
01:22:23,096 --> 01:22:26,849
There's hundreds of prisoners out there
and only a few men to guard them.

604
01:22:27,016 --> 01:22:29,225
What am 
 supposed to do?

 have to have respect!

605
01:22:29,392 --> 01:22:34,188

 think that you'll manage to gain
their respect by treating them better!

606
01:22:35,564 --> 01:22:38,108
Are our men treated that well
in Andersonville Camp?

607
01:22:38,275 --> 01:22:40,944
I don't give a goddamn
what they do in Andersonville!

608
01:22:41,111 --> 01:22:43,363
While I'm in charge here,
the prisoners are not to be...

609
01:22:43,530 --> 01:22:44,573
tortured...

610
01:22:44,740 --> 01:22:46,324
...or cheated...

611
01:22:46,490 --> 01:22:48,074
...or murdered!

612
01:22:48,366 --> 01:22:50,118
Is that an accusation?

613
01:22:50,285 --> 01:22:53,580
Sergeant, gangrene is eating
my leg away...

614
01:22:54,372 --> 01:22:55,956
..not my eyes.

615
01:22:56,123 --> 01:22:59,126

 know the prisoners here are being
robbed systematically.

616
01:22:59,293 --> 01:23:03,005

 know there's scum around,
or bivouacked near the camp, waiting...

617
01:23:03,172 --> 01:23:06,008
...for someone to deliver this loot.

618
01:23:06,175 --> 01:23:09,803
But as long as I'm commandant,

 won't permit any such trickery!

619
01:23:09,970 --> 01:23:11,513
Am 
 clear?

620
01:23:13,307 --> 01:23:14,599
Yes, sir.

621
01:23:14,766 --> 01:23:17,894
Just as long as you're the commandant.

622
01:23:18,936 --> 01:23:20,520
Yes, sergeant.

623
01:23:23,398 --> 01:23:26,693

 know this leg means

 won't last very long...

624
01:23:26,860 --> 01:23:29,613
...but 
 pray 
 can manage
to have enough time...

625
01:23:29,780 --> 01:23:34,743
...to amass evidence and bring to a
court-martial all those who discredit...

626
01:23:35,452 --> 01:23:38,037
...and dishonor the uniform...

627
01:23:38,287 --> 01:23:39,955
...of the Union!

628
01:23:44,210 --> 01:23:45,920
I wish you luck.

629
01:24:20,538 --> 01:24:23,374
You and the others better lay low
for a few days.

630
01:24:24,666 --> 01:24:28,294
I'll keep this. You go.
Wallace will let you know.

631
01:24:40,682 --> 01:24:43,184
- Bring me Carson.
- Right.

632
01:24:57,699 --> 01:25:00,702
Angel Eyes said for us
to lay low for a few days.

633
01:25:01,035 --> 01:25:04,038
But we'll keep close enough
to keep an eye on things.

634
01:25:04,456 --> 01:25:06,416
Come on, saddle your horses.

635
01:25:17,135 --> 01:25:18,511
Come on in, Tuco.

636
01:25:19,262 --> 01:25:20,762
Don't be bashful.

637
01:25:21,680 --> 01:25:23,974
There's no formalities here.

638
01:25:35,235 --> 01:25:37,237
It's been a long time!

639
01:25:40,866 --> 01:25:42,074
You're hungry.

640
01:25:43,075 --> 01:25:44,743
Sit down. Eat!

641
01:26:04,179 --> 01:26:05,931
I knew it, 
 knew it!

642
01:26:07,766 --> 01:26:09,935
The minute 
 saw you, 
 said to myself:

643
01:26:11,102 --> 01:26:13,522
“Look at that pig, Angel Eyes..."

644
01:26:14,940 --> 01:26:17,400
",.[IL bet he's got himself
an easy job!"

645
01:26:20,737 --> 01:26:22,739
“And he never forgets a friend!"

646
01:26:23,615 --> 01:26:25,742
I never forget old friends, Tuco.

647
01:26:29,703 --> 01:26:31,663
It's good to see old friends again.

648
01:26:34,958 --> 01:26:37,627
Especially when they come
from so far away...

649
01:26:38,378 --> 01:26:40,630
...and have so much to talk about.

650
01:26:42,173 --> 01:26:45,051
And you do have a lot to talk about,
haven't you?

651
01:26:47,636 --> 01:26:49,304
You were captured near...

652
01:26:49,680 --> 01:26:50,722
...Fort Craig?

653
01:26:55,561 --> 01:26:58,313
If you were with Sibley,
then you were...

654
01:26:59,231 --> 01:27:00,941
...coming from Santa Fe?

655
01:27:13,537 --> 01:27:15,372
Was it hard crossing the desert?

656
01:27:16,248 --> 01:27:17,291
Very hard!

657
01:27:19,167 --> 01:27:21,752
Especially if you don't have
anything to drink.

658
01:27:24,463 --> 01:27:27,383
Why are you going under the name
of Bill Carson, now?

659
01:27:33,097 --> 01:27:35,349
One name is as good as another.

660
01:27:35,850 --> 01:27:37,852
Not wise to use your own name.

661
01:27:38,853 --> 01:27:42,273
Like you, 
 bet they don't call you
Angel Eyes.

662
01:27:43,357 --> 01:27:45,233
Sergeant Angel Eyes.

663
01:27:54,284 --> 01:27:56,536
Like a little music with your meal, Tuco?

664
01:27:57,412 --> 01:27:58,413
Music?

665
01:27:58,997 --> 01:28:02,042
Yes, very good for the digestion.

666
01:28:17,557 --> 01:28:19,684
Bill Carson's a fake name, huh?

667
01:28:25,732 --> 01:28:27,275
That fake, too?

668
01:28:29,027 --> 01:28:31,488
Bill Carson's name is written on it.

669
01:28:33,198 --> 01:28:34,532
Have some.

670
01:28:35,367 --> 01:28:37,410
It's Bill Carson's tobacco.

671
01:30:01,327 --> 01:30:04,122
Was Carson dead or alive
when you found him?

672
01:30:10,587 --> 01:30:12,714
What'd he tell you about the money?

673
01:30:16,760 --> 01:30:19,012
I don't know what you're talking about!

674
01:30:36,988 --> 01:30:38,782
More feeling.

675
01:30:57,050 --> 01:31:00,345
You can sure consider yourself
much luckier than your pal.

676
01:31:00,804 --> 01:31:03,681
Wallace will punch your friend
as long as the song goes.

677
01:31:03,848 --> 01:31:06,559
So many of us have had a session in there.

678
01:31:28,122 --> 01:31:30,124
How's your digestion now?

679
01:31:34,087 --> 01:31:35,671
You'd better talk.

680
01:31:35,963 --> 01:31:38,172

 have nothing to tell you!

681
01:32:05,700 --> 01:32:07,326
Play that fiddle, you!

682
01:32:51,954 --> 01:32:54,040
Ill talk!

683
01:33:03,925 --> 01:33:06,134
What did he say about the money?

684
01:33:11,056 --> 01:33:12,640
It's buried in a grave.

685
01:33:13,848 --> 01:33:14,932
Where?

686
01:33:17,976 --> 01:33:19,895
At the Sad Hill Cemetery.

687
01:33:22,189 --> 01:33:23,941
Which grave?

688
01:33:24,232 --> 01:33:25,776
I don't know!

689
01:33:29,737 --> 01:33:31,029
Blondie...

690
01:33:33,990 --> 01:33:36,534
...he knows the name of the grave.

691
01:33:53,218 --> 01:33:54,844
The war's over for you.

692
01:33:58,597 --> 01:34:00,224
Put those clothes on.

693
01:34:04,687 --> 01:34:06,105
Why?

694
01:34:06,647 --> 01:34:08,607
We're going for a ride.

695
01:34:09,650 --> 01:34:10,442
Where?

696
01:34:10,776 --> 01:34:13,112
To find $200,000.

697
01:34:14,154 --> 01:34:16,407
I know the name of the cemetery now...

698
01:34:17,241 --> 01:34:19,618
..and you know the name of the grave.

699
01:34:39,638 --> 01:34:42,641
You're not going to give me
the same treatment?

700
01:34:46,394 --> 01:34:47,729
Would you talk?

701
01:34:49,105 --> 01:34:51,149
No, probably not.

702
01:34:52,733 --> 01:34:54,359
That's what 
 thought.

703
01:34:55,277 --> 01:34:57,069
Not that you are any tougher than Tuco...

704
01:34:57,528 --> 01:35:00,573
...but you're smart enough to know
that talking won't save you.

705
01:35:04,618 --> 01:35:07,538
And Tuco, is he?

706
01:35:09,874 --> 01:35:11,917
No, not yet...

707
01:35:13,209 --> 01:35:15,169
...but he's in very good hands.

708
01:35:16,712 --> 01:35:19,673
You changed partners,
but you still got the same deal.

709
01:35:20,007 --> 01:35:22,592
I'm not greedy. I'm only taking half.

710
01:35:24,010 --> 01:35:25,344
There's two of us.

711
01:35:25,720 --> 01:35:28,222
It should make it easier than just one.

712
01:35:54,165 --> 01:35:56,374
Hold it. That's it.

713
01:35:56,917 --> 01:35:58,043
Don't move.

714
01:35:59,044 --> 01:36:00,504
Don't breathe.

715
01:36:04,216 --> 01:36:05,926
Got it. Thank you.

716
01:36:22,067 --> 01:36:25,444
Hey, Corporal, afraid he'll get lost?
Where's the Rebel going?

717
01:36:25,736 --> 01:36:28,321
To hell with a rope around his neck
and a price on his head.

718
01:36:28,488 --> 01:36:30,949
Yeah, $3,000, friend.

719
01:36:31,491 --> 01:36:33,576
That's a lot of money for a head.

720
01:36:34,744 --> 01:36:37,622

 bet they didn't even pay you
a penny for your arm.

721
01:36:43,961 --> 01:36:47,047
I told you once,
but if lever get you down...

722
01:36:47,589 --> 01:36:50,050
...you're gonna need a lot of help
to get up again.

723
01:37:10,362 --> 01:37:12,531
You're a lot luckier than that one there.

724
01:37:12,698 --> 01:37:15,200
You get some proper rope,
and you're all finished.

725
01:37:15,367 --> 01:37:18,328
And there isn't any partner, this time,
to shoot you down.

726
01:37:42,978 --> 01:37:44,229
Get up!

727
01:39:13,110 --> 01:39:15,612
Sure would like to put
your paw on it, huh?

728
01:39:17,906 --> 01:39:19,866

 would like to piss, it's rough.

729
01:39:20,075 --> 01:39:22,577
I've been shaken up in this train
nearly ten hours now.

730
01:39:22,744 --> 01:39:24,788
You smell like a pig already!

731
01:39:25,580 --> 01:39:28,083
Let's try not to make things any worse.

732
01:39:30,544 --> 01:39:31,962
Get goin'

733
01:39:41,138 --> 01:39:43,931
I can't while you're watching me.

734
01:40:07,163 --> 01:40:09,956
You made a lot of noise my friend, huh?

735
01:40:30,852 --> 01:40:32,771
You don't wanna break
our friendship, huh?

736
01:40:32,937 --> 01:40:34,397
Well, I'll break it!

737
01:42:56,831 --> 01:42:58,917
Clemens, take care of the horses.

738
01:47:08,833 --> 01:47:11,461
I've been looking for you
for eight months!

739
01:47:12,503 --> 01:47:15,381
Whenever 
 should have had
a gun in my right hand...

740
01:47:15,631 --> 01:47:16,883
...1 thought of you!

741
01:47:17,175 --> 01:47:20,386
Now I find you in exactly
the position that suits me.

742
01:47:21,179 --> 01:47:25,099

 had lots of time to learn
how to shoot with my left.

743
01:47:40,948 --> 01:47:43,242
When you have to shoot, shoot!
Don't talk.

744
01:47:47,121 --> 01:47:49,749
Every gun makes its own tune...

745
01:47:50,291 --> 01:47:52,543
..and it's perfect timing, large one.

746
01:48:11,020 --> 01:48:13,272
Clem, follow him.

747
01:49:10,288 --> 01:49:12,623
Just a minute. I'll be right there.

748
01:49:13,416 --> 01:49:16,502
Just give me a little time to get dressed,
and I'll open up.

749
01:49:37,398 --> 01:49:40,109
Put your drawers on,
and take your gun off.

750
01:49:53,247 --> 01:49:55,958
How the hell did you get out
of that pigsty?

751
01:49:57,418 --> 01:50:01,297
My own way.
I'm here with your old friend Angel Eyes.

752
01:50:02,381 --> 01:50:05,259
You talked, you traitor! You talked!

753
01:50:06,218 --> 01:50:07,886
No, 
 didn't talk.

754
01:50:08,428 --> 01:50:11,097
If 
 did,

 probably wouldn't be here, now.

755
01:50:15,310 --> 01:50:17,646
So, only you know your half of the secret?

756
01:50:24,903 --> 01:50:27,155
I'm very happy you are working with me!

757
01:50:27,447 --> 01:50:28,907
And we're together again.

758
01:50:29,407 --> 01:50:31,701
I'll get dressed, 
 kill him,
and be right back.

759
01:50:31,868 --> 01:50:34,453
Listen, I forgot to mention.

760
01:50:37,289 --> 01:50:39,874
He's not alone. There's five of ‘em.

761
01:50:42,335 --> 01:50:44,587
- Five?
- Yeah, five of ‘em.

762
01:50:47,882 --> 01:50:50,134
So, that's why you came to Tuco.

763
01:50:53,721 --> 01:50:56,306
It doesn't matter. I'll kill them all!

764
01:51:08,068 --> 01:51:10,028
They shot him at close range.

765
01:51:29,755 --> 01:51:31,465
Well, look who's here!

766
01:51:32,008 --> 01:51:33,718
The other one will be along.

767
01:51:36,637 --> 01:51:38,597
They'll come looking for us.

768
01:51:40,224 --> 01:51:41,559
Watch out!

769
01:51:42,810 --> 01:51:44,437
There's two of them.

770
01:51:45,813 --> 01:51:47,982

 want that blond alive!

771
01:51:56,741 --> 01:51:59,869
You back there. Come on, let's go!

772
01:52:34,195 --> 01:52:36,363
Were you going to die alone?

773
01:54:54,710 --> 01:54:56,212
Angel Eyes is mine.

774
01:54:56,670 --> 01:54:57,922
All right.

775
01:55:37,586 --> 01:55:39,505
“See you soon."

776
01:55:42,174 --> 01:55:43,133
"Idiots."

777
01:55:44,969 --> 01:55:46,220
It's for you.

778
01:56:11,245 --> 01:56:13,414
How peaceful and quiet, amigo.

779
01:56:14,331 --> 01:56:16,583
Like a cemetery, for instance?

780
01:56:18,085 --> 01:56:20,379
There should be a bridge
across that river.

781
01:56:21,171 --> 01:56:22,631
We better wait for nightfall.

782
01:56:22,798 --> 01:56:24,425
Trust in me, Blondie.

783
01:56:27,761 --> 01:56:29,596
I got a good sense of where I'm going.

784
01:56:29,763 --> 01:56:32,641
Tuco has taken you this far,

 will take you all the way...

785
01:56:38,772 --> 01:56:40,524
- Tell the captain.
- Yes, sir.

786
01:56:41,900 --> 01:56:44,361
Come along now. Follow me.

787
01:57:30,991 --> 01:57:33,452
We found them near the perimeter, sir.

788
01:57:48,008 --> 01:57:49,843
Where do you hail from?

789
01:57:50,386 --> 01:57:51,720
Illinois.

790
01:57:54,181 --> 01:57:55,516
And you?

791
01:57:56,850 --> 01:57:57,976
I'm with him.

792
01:58:04,233 --> 01:58:06,235
Your reason for being around here?

793
01:58:07,361 --> 01:58:09,822
We want to enlist, general!

794
01:58:12,825 --> 01:58:14,993
You'd better learn to distinguish rank.

795
01:58:15,369 --> 01:58:16,745
I'm a captain!

796
01:58:18,705 --> 01:58:20,124
Get the hell out!

797
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:25,212
It sure as hell might be you today,
so go write your will.

798
01:58:31,593 --> 01:58:33,553
So, you want to enlist.

799
01:58:34,720 --> 01:58:36,889
You got to take a test to prove it.

800
01:58:46,441 --> 01:58:47,941
Well, show me.

801
01:59:11,840 --> 01:59:16,052
You've got a career.
At the least, I'd say you'll make colonel!

802
01:59:16,219 --> 01:59:17,721
- Really?
- Sure!

803
01:59:19,055 --> 01:59:20,765
Like it says in the manual.

804
01:59:21,266 --> 01:59:25,520
You've got every qualification
to become expert in the use of weapons.

805
01:59:26,896 --> 01:59:30,608
This is the most potent weapon in war!

806
01:59:33,861 --> 01:59:35,988
The fighting spirit is in this bottle!

807
01:59:38,324 --> 01:59:39,950
Volunteers...

808
01:59:42,036 --> 01:59:43,996
You want to enlist?

809
01:59:45,288 --> 01:59:46,372
Then let's go.

810
01:59:51,461 --> 01:59:53,630
The shooting hasn't begun yet.

811
01:59:54,838 --> 01:59:58,717
Yes, because soon you can join
the gallant heroes of Branston Bridge.

812
02:00:00,761 --> 02:00:04,138
- We have two attacks a day.
- Two attacks a day?

813
02:00:04,472 --> 02:00:05,431
Sure.

814
02:00:05,598 --> 02:00:09,519
The Reb's have decided that damn bridge
is the key to this whole area.

815
02:00:11,311 --> 02:00:13,480
Stupid, useless bridge.

816
02:00:14,022 --> 02:00:16,566
A flyspeck on headquarters’ maps.

817
02:00:18,401 --> 02:00:23,031
And headquarters has declared that
we must take that ridiculous flyspeck...

818
02:00:24,783 --> 02:00:26,618
...even if all of us are killed.

819
02:00:26,993 --> 02:00:31,081
Otherwise, the key'll get rusty
and just be a spot on the wall.

820
02:00:32,749 --> 02:00:34,084
And that's not all.

821
02:00:34,751 --> 02:00:37,128
Both sides want the bridge intact!

822
02:00:37,420 --> 02:00:41,424
Intact is how the South wants it.
And we want it intact, too.

823
02:00:44,553 --> 02:00:48,223
You'll all turn to dust,
but one thing is sure, boys...

824
02:00:49,140 --> 02:00:51,977
...Branston Bridge will stand unbroken.

825
02:00:53,353 --> 02:00:54,437
Is it bad...

826
02:00:54,813 --> 02:00:57,232
...to speak the way 
 do to volunteers?

827
02:00:58,692 --> 02:01:00,610
I've done a lot worse.

828
02:01:05,198 --> 02:01:07,242
I've done it. I've blown it up...

829
02:01:09,827 --> 02:01:13,080
...In here. I've destroyed it all.

830
02:01:13,956 --> 02:01:17,251
It's a court-martial offense to imagine--
to dream of blowing it up.

831
02:01:17,418 --> 02:01:19,086
A serious crime.

832
02:01:19,461 --> 02:01:23,173
Even to think of destroying
that bridge is just...

833
02:01:26,468 --> 02:01:28,762
Why not really blow it up, captain?

834
02:01:30,306 --> 02:01:33,726
Yeah, captain, it's nothing.
Let's scare the hell out of them!

835
02:01:37,146 --> 02:01:39,273
I've been dreaming about it.

836
02:01:42,943 --> 02:01:44,987
I've even worked out a plan.

837
02:01:46,614 --> 02:01:48,157

 sure have!

838
02:01:49,241 --> 02:01:52,036
The best time is after the attack...

839
02:01:52,536 --> 02:01:55,289
...when there's a truce
to get the wounded.

840
02:01:56,457 --> 02:01:57,708
If 
 could do it...

841
02:01:58,626 --> 02:02:00,669
...l could save many thousands of men.

842
02:02:06,759 --> 02:02:08,719
But what I lack is the guts.

843
02:02:14,892 --> 02:02:17,811
They're beginning the daily slaughter,
right on time.

844
02:02:18,187 --> 02:02:20,898
Captain! All companies
are awaiting your orders.

845
02:02:21,690 --> 02:02:23,274
I'll be right there.

846
02:02:39,040 --> 02:02:40,332
All right, friends...

847
02:02:40,957 --> 02:02:43,126
..come along and enjoy the spectacle.

848
02:03:14,574 --> 02:03:15,617
Companies!

849
02:03:16,034 --> 02:03:17,077
Report!

850
02:03:17,369 --> 02:03:19,578
Company B, ready!

851
02:03:56,699 --> 02:04:00,327
It looks like the captain is really asking
for a bullet in his guts!

852
02:04:54,131 --> 02:04:57,426
I've never seen
so many men wasted so badly.

853
02:05:18,030 --> 02:05:21,575
I've a feeling it's really gonna be
a good long battle.

854
02:05:28,040 --> 02:05:30,417
The money is
on the other side of the river.

855
02:05:32,085 --> 02:05:33,044
Where?

856
02:05:35,880 --> 02:05:38,883
Amigo, 
 said on the other side.
That's enough.

857
02:05:39,967 --> 02:05:43,011
But while the Confederates are there,
we can't get across.

858
02:05:44,721 --> 02:05:48,725
What would happen
if somebody were to blow up that bridge?

859
02:05:52,354 --> 02:05:55,065
Then these idiots would go
somewhere else to fight!

860
02:05:55,899 --> 02:05:57,025
Maybe.

861
02:06:35,147 --> 02:06:37,983
Doctor, quick! The captain's wounded!

862
02:06:40,444 --> 02:06:42,236
Hurry, a stretcher!

863
02:06:44,613 --> 02:06:46,281
Easy, now.

864
02:06:57,167 --> 02:06:58,793
Get things ready.

865
02:07:19,814 --> 02:07:21,316
A little of this will help.

866
02:07:28,239 --> 02:07:30,158
Take a slug of this, captain...

867
02:07:30,700 --> 02:07:32,702
..and keep your ears open.

868
02:08:21,501 --> 02:08:22,585
What're you doing?

869
02:10:05,313 --> 02:10:08,191
You realize we might be risking our lives?

870
02:10:09,734 --> 02:10:13,695
If 
 get killed, you'll never get
your hands on all that beautiful money.

871
02:10:16,907 --> 02:10:18,826
It sure would be a pity.

872
02:10:54,653 --> 02:10:56,780
Can you help me live a little more?

873
02:10:57,489 --> 02:10:59,241
l expect good news.

874
02:11:12,546 --> 02:11:15,382
Why don't we tell each other
our half of the secret?

875
02:11:15,883 --> 02:11:17,843
Why don't we?

876
02:11:19,386 --> 02:11:20,678
You go first.

877
02:11:23,014 --> 02:11:25,516
No, 
 think it's better that...

878
02:11:27,977 --> 02:11:29,312
...you start.

879
02:11:33,566 --> 02:11:34,567
All right.

880
02:11:37,360 --> 02:11:39,737
The name of the cemetery is...

881
02:11:57,630 --> 02:11:59,798
...9ad Hill! Now it's your turn!

882
02:12:08,098 --> 02:12:09,892
The name on the grave is...

883
02:12:14,605 --> 02:12:15,940
...Arch Stanton.

884
02:12:18,192 --> 02:12:19,276
Arch Stanton?

885
02:12:19,985 --> 02:12:21,320
Are you sure?

886
02:12:22,238 --> 02:12:23,948
Sure, I'm sure.

887
02:24:09,736 --> 02:24:11,780
It'd be a lot easier with that.

888
02:24:52,362 --> 02:24:54,571
Two can dig a lot quicker than one.

889
02:24:55,239 --> 02:24:56,323
Dig!

890
02:24:59,451 --> 02:25:01,078
You're not digging?

891
02:25:13,340 --> 02:25:16,051
If you shoot me,
you won't see a cent of that money.

892
02:25:18,846 --> 02:25:19,722
Why?

893
02:25:22,850 --> 02:25:24,226
Mil tell you why.

894
02:25:25,436 --> 02:25:27,104
"Cause there's nothin' in there.

895
02:25:37,531 --> 02:25:39,283
You thought I'd trust you?

896
02:25:42,536 --> 02:25:44,913
$200,000 is a lot of money.

897
02:25:46,581 --> 02:25:48,332
We're gonna have to earn it.

898
02:25:52,085 --> 02:25:52,794
How?

899
02:26:04,639 --> 02:26:07,184
I'll write the name
on the bottom of this stone.

900
02:26:11,354 --> 02:26:12,314
The gun?

901
02:32:19,097 --> 02:32:23,184
You pig! You wanted to get me killed?
When'd you unload it?

902
02:32:25,270 --> 02:32:26,396
Last night.

903
02:32:27,730 --> 02:32:31,275
You see, in this world there's two kinds
of people, my friend...

904
02:32:32,443 --> 02:32:36,071
...those with loaded guns,
and those who dig.

905
02:32:37,197 --> 02:32:38,365
You dig.

906
02:32:39,032 --> 02:32:39,867
Where?

907
02:32:51,128 --> 02:32:52,129
Here.

908
02:32:56,675 --> 02:32:58,135
There's no name on it!

909
02:32:59,803 --> 02:33:01,722
There's no name here, either.

910
02:33:03,557 --> 02:33:06,268
You see, that’s what Bill Carson told me:

911
02:33:06,935 --> 02:33:10,688
“There's a grave marked ‘unknown’,
right beside Arch Stanton."

912
02:33:18,237 --> 02:33:19,363
Go ahead.

913
02:34:17,380 --> 02:34:19,924
It's money! It's all ours, Blondie!

914
02:34:37,066 --> 02:34:41,529
You're joking, Blondie. You wouldn't...
you wouldn't play a joke on me like that.

915
02:34:42,613 --> 02:34:44,615
It's no joke. It's a rope, Tuco.

916
02:34:45,866 --> 02:34:49,035

 want you to stand up there,
and put your head in that noose.

917
02:35:56,436 --> 02:35:57,604
Well, now...

918
02:35:58,521 --> 02:36:00,774
..seems just like old times.

919
02:36:05,111 --> 02:36:06,613
Four for you...

920
02:36:13,370 --> 02:36:14,621
...and four for me.

921
02:36:57,455 --> 02:36:58,747
Sorry, Tuco.

922
02:39:35,362 --> 02:39:37,364
Hey, Blondie...

923
02:39:39,324 --> 02:39:42,035
...you know what you are?

924
02:39:45,831 --> 02:39:48,584
Just a dirty son of a...!
