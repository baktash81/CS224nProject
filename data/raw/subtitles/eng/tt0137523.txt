1
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:35,018
<i>People always ask me
if I know Tyler Durden.</i>

2
00:01:35,962 --> 00:01:36,986
Three minutes.

3
00:01:37,063 --> 00:01:39,395
This is it. Ground zero.

4
00:01:39,465 --> 00:01:43,163
Do you have a speech for the occasion?

5
00:01:43,237 --> 00:01:46,797
<i>With a gun barrel between your teeth,
you speak only in vowels.</i>

6
00:01:46,872 --> 00:01:48,965
I can't think of anything.

7
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:52,910
<i>For a second, I forget about
Tyler's controlled demolition thing</i>

8
00:01:53,013 --> 00:01:55,173
<i>and I wonder how clean that gun is.</i>

9
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:57,307
It's getting exciting now.

10
00:01:57,416 --> 00:02:00,580
<i>That old thing,
how you always hurt the one you love.</i>

11
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:02,780
<i>Well, it works both ways.</i>

12
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:07,122
<i>We have front-row seats
for this theater of mass destruction.</i>

13
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:09,991
<i>The Demolitions Committee
of Project Mayhem</i>

14
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:13,500
<i>wrapped the foundations
of 12 buildings with explosives.</i>

15
00:02:14,269 --> 00:02:17,669
<i>In two minutes,
primary charges will blow base charges</i>

16
00:02:17,738 --> 00:02:21,106
<i>and a few blocks will be reduced
to smouldering rubble.</i>

17
00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:24,235
<i>I know this because Tyler knows this.</i>

18
00:02:24,312 --> 00:02:27,714
Two and a half.
Think of everything we've accomplished.

19
00:02:27,816 --> 00:02:33,151
<i>Suddenly I realize that all of this,
the gun, the bombs, the revolution,</i>

20
00:02:33,254 --> 00:02:36,520
<i>has got something to do
with a girl named Marla Singer.</i>

21
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,426
<i>Bob. Bob had bitch tits.</i>

22
00:02:41,496 --> 00:02:45,695
<i>This was a support group
for men with testicular cancer.</i>

23
00:02:45,768 --> 00:02:49,067
<i>The big moosie slobbering all over me,
that was Bob.</i>

24
00:02:49,138 --> 00:02:51,299
We're still men.

25
00:02:51,373 --> 00:02:53,568
Yes, we're men.

26
00:02:53,709 --> 00:02:55,870
Men is what we are.

27
00:02:55,944 --> 00:02:59,381
<i>Bob had had his testicles removed.
Then hormone therapy.</i>

28
00:02:59,482 --> 00:03:03,281
<i>He developed bitch tits because
his testosterone was too high</i>

29
00:03:03,352 --> 00:03:05,480
<i>and his body upped the oestrogen.</i>

30
00:03:05,555 --> 00:03:09,286
<i>- That was where I fit...
- They'll have to drain my pecs again.</i>

31
00:03:09,359 --> 00:03:11,851
<i>..between those huge sweating tits</i>

32
00:03:11,929 --> 00:03:16,160
<i>that hung enormous,
the way you'd think of God's as big.</i>

33
00:03:16,266 --> 00:03:18,461
OK, you cry now.

34
00:03:18,535 --> 00:03:21,096
<i>No, wait. Back up. Let me start earlier.</i>

35
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:25,103
<i>For six months, I couldn't sleep.</i>

36
00:03:25,175 --> 00:03:27,736
<i>I couldn't sleep.</i>

37
00:03:27,812 --> 00:03:29,973
<i>With insomnia, nothing's real.</i>

38
00:03:30,081 --> 00:03:32,140
<i>Everything's far away.</i>

39
00:03:33,084 --> 00:03:35,416
<i>Everything's a copy of a copy</i>

40
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,544
<i>of a copy.</i>

41
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:45,419
<i>When deep space exploration ramps up,
it'll be the corporations that name everything.</i>

42
00:03:45,529 --> 00:03:47,588
<i>The IBM Stellar Sphere.</i>

43
00:03:47,932 --> 00:03:49,992
<i>The Microsoft Galaxy.</i>

44
00:03:50,102 --> 00:03:52,161
<i>The Planet Starbucks.</i>

45
00:03:52,738 --> 00:03:55,799
I need you out of town this week
to cover some red flags.

46
00:03:55,907 --> 00:03:59,434
<i>It must have been Tuesday.
He had on his cornflower blue tie.</i>

47
00:03:59,544 --> 00:04:04,141
You want me to deprioritize my reports
until you advise of a status upgrade?

48
00:04:04,217 --> 00:04:08,812
Prioritize these. Here's your flight coupons.
Call me if there's any snags.

49
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:12,789
<i>He was full of pep.
Must have had his grande latte enema.</i>

50
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:19,025
<i>Like so many others, I had become
a slave to the Ikea nesting instinct.</i>

51
00:04:19,132 --> 00:04:21,464
Yes. I'd like to order

52
00:04:21,567 --> 00:04:23,831
the Erika Pekkari dust ruffles.

53
00:04:23,936 --> 00:04:26,030
<i>- Please hold.
- Anything clever,</i>

54
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:30,473
<i>like a coffee table in the shape of a yin-yang,
I had to have it.</i>

55
00:04:31,544 --> 00:04:33,945
<i>The Klipsk personal office unit.</i>

56
00:04:34,014 --> 00:04:36,278
<i>The Hovetrekke home exerbike.</i>

57
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:40,211
<i>Or the Ohamshab sofa
with the Strinne green stripe pattern.</i>

58
00:04:40,287 --> 00:04:45,782
<i>Even the Ryslampa wire lamps of
environmentally-friendly unbleached paper.</i>

59
00:04:45,859 --> 00:04:48,658
<i>I'd flip through catalogues and wonder</i>

60
00:04:48,797 --> 00:04:51,822
<i>"What kind of dining set
defines me as a person?"</i>

61
00:04:51,899 --> 00:04:56,667
<i>I had it all. Even the glass dishes
with tiny bubbles and imperfections,</i>

62
00:04:56,805 --> 00:05:01,868
<i>proof that they were crafted by the honest,
hard-working, indigenous peoples of...</i>

63
00:05:01,976 --> 00:05:04,911
<i>- Please hold.
- ..wherever.</i>

64
00:05:05,413 --> 00:05:07,506
<i>We used to read pornography.</i>

65
00:05:07,615 --> 00:05:10,449
<i>Now it was the Horchow collection.</i>

66
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:13,919
- No. You can't die of insomnia.
- What about narcolepsy?

67
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:16,389
I nod off, I wake up in strange places.

68
00:05:16,459 --> 00:05:18,518
I have no idea how I got there.

69
00:05:18,627 --> 00:05:22,427
- You need to lighten up.
- Can you please just give me something?

70
00:05:22,498 --> 00:05:26,127
<i>Red and blue Tuinals, lipstick-red Seconals...</i>

71
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:29,993
No. You need healthy, natural sleep.

72
00:05:30,706 --> 00:05:34,199
Chew some valerian root
and get more exercise.

73
00:05:36,245 --> 00:05:38,305
Hey, come on.

74
00:05:38,415 --> 00:05:40,474
- I'm in pain.
- You wanna see pain?

75
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:43,110
Swing by First Methodist, Tuesday nights.

76
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:46,280
See the guys with testicular cancer.

77
00:05:46,356 --> 00:05:48,449
That's pain.

78
00:06:04,342 --> 00:06:07,743
I always wanted three kids...
two boys and a girl.

79
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:10,245
Mindy wanted two girls and a boy.

80
00:06:11,849 --> 00:06:14,317
We never could agree on anything.

81
00:06:14,652 --> 00:06:16,450
Well, I... She...

82
00:06:16,522 --> 00:06:19,046
She had her first child last week.

83
00:06:19,123 --> 00:06:21,353
A girl.

84
00:06:21,459 --> 00:06:24,691
With... With her... With her new husband.

85
00:06:25,531 --> 00:06:27,590
Fuck!

86
00:06:28,934 --> 00:06:30,993
Thank God, you know...

87
00:06:31,103 --> 00:06:33,162
I'm glad for her.

88
00:06:33,972 --> 00:06:36,942
She deserves...

89
00:06:40,746 --> 00:06:44,581
Everyone, let's thank Thomas
for sharing himself with us.

90
00:06:44,684 --> 00:06:46,743
Thank you, Thomas.

91
00:06:46,886 --> 00:06:50,322
I look around this room,
and I see a lot of courage.

92
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:52,483
And that gives me strength.

93
00:06:52,559 --> 00:06:54,925
We give each other strength.

94
00:06:54,994 --> 00:06:57,292
It's time for the one-on-ones.

95
00:06:57,897 --> 00:07:02,301
So let's all of us follow Thomas's example
and really open ourselves up.

96
00:07:02,368 --> 00:07:04,427
Could you find a partner?

97
00:07:06,607 --> 00:07:09,770
<i>And this is how I met the big moosie.</i>

98
00:07:11,445 --> 00:07:14,642
<i>His eyes already shrink-wrapped in tears.</i>

99
00:07:17,151 --> 00:07:19,949
<i>Knees together. Those awkward little steps.</i>

100
00:07:25,159 --> 00:07:27,252
- My name is Bob.
- Bob?

101
00:07:27,962 --> 00:07:30,227
<i>Bob had been a champion bodybuilder.</i>

102
00:07:30,332 --> 00:07:33,995
<i>You know that chest expansion programme
on late-night TV?</i>

103
00:07:34,069 --> 00:07:36,162
<i>That was his idea.</i>

104
00:07:36,237 --> 00:07:38,330
I was a juicer.

105
00:07:38,406 --> 00:07:40,533
You know, using steroids?

106
00:07:40,609 --> 00:07:43,135
Diabonal and

107
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:45,544
Wisterol.

108
00:07:45,615 --> 00:07:49,550
Oh, they use that on racehorses,
for Christ sakes.

109
00:07:50,051 --> 00:07:52,145
And now I'm bankrupt.

110
00:07:53,022 --> 00:07:55,081
I'm divorced.

111
00:07:55,825 --> 00:07:57,952
My two grown kids

112
00:07:58,794 --> 00:08:01,456
won't even return my phone calls.

113
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:06,628
<i>Strangers with this kind of honesty
make me go a big, rubbery one.</i>

114
00:08:08,437 --> 00:08:10,496
Go ahead,... Cornelius.

115
00:08:10,606 --> 00:08:12,666
You can cry.

116
00:08:28,426 --> 00:08:31,861
<i>And then... something happened.
I let go.</i>

117
00:08:31,995 --> 00:08:34,054
That's really good.

118
00:08:34,131 --> 00:08:36,225
<i>Lost in oblivion.</i>

119
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,598
<i>Dark and silent and complete.</i>

120
00:08:41,605 --> 00:08:45,303
<i>I found freedom.
Losing all hope was freedom.</i>

121
00:08:47,745 --> 00:08:49,839
It's OK.

122
00:08:52,116 --> 00:08:54,311
<i>Babies don't sleep this well.</i>

123
00:08:57,923 --> 00:09:00,517
<i>I became addicted.</i>

124
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:16,298
If I didn't say anything

125
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:19,072
people always assumed the worst.

126
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:25,976
They cried harder... then I cried harder.

127
00:09:35,396 --> 00:09:39,559
Now we're going to open the green door,
the heart chakra...

128
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:41,726
<i>I wasn't really dying.</i>

129
00:09:41,869 --> 00:09:44,599
<i>I wasn't host to cancer or parasites.</i>

130
00:09:45,539 --> 00:09:49,407
<i>I was the warm little center
that the life of this world crowded around.</i>

131
00:09:50,411 --> 00:09:53,380
Imagine your pain
as a white ball of healing light.

132
00:09:53,481 --> 00:09:57,578
It moves over your body, healing you.

133
00:09:57,686 --> 00:10:01,177
Now keep this going. Remember to breathe

134
00:10:01,288 --> 00:10:04,952
and step forward
through the back door of the room.

135
00:10:05,794 --> 00:10:07,921
Where does it lead?

136
00:10:08,029 --> 00:10:10,156
To your cave.

137
00:10:10,232 --> 00:10:12,132
Step forward

138
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,395
into your cave.

139
00:10:14,503 --> 00:10:16,562
That's right.

140
00:10:16,638 --> 00:10:20,130
You're going deeper into your cave.

141
00:10:20,809 --> 00:10:22,902
And you're going to find

142
00:10:22,978 --> 00:10:25,106
your power animal.

143
00:10:27,216 --> 00:10:28,547
Slide.

144
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:41,723
<i>Every evening I died.</i>

145
00:10:42,865 --> 00:10:45,561
<i>And every evening I was born again.</i>

146
00:10:46,169 --> 00:10:48,229
<i>Resurrected.</i>

147
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,472
<i>Bob loved me because he thought
my testicles were removed too.</i>

148
00:10:54,578 --> 00:10:57,376
<i>Being there, pressed against his tits,</i>

149
00:10:57,447 --> 00:10:59,540
<i>ready to cry.</i>

150
00:10:59,616 --> 00:11:02,279
<i>This was my vacation.</i>

151
00:11:04,588 --> 00:11:06,215
<i>And she</i>

152
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,953
<i>ruined everything.</i>

153
00:11:09,027 --> 00:11:11,154
This is cancer, right?

154
00:11:14,032 --> 00:11:16,262
<i>This chick, Marla Singer,</i>

155
00:11:16,367 --> 00:11:18,995
<i>did not have testicular cancer.</i>

156
00:11:19,103 --> 00:11:21,196
<i>She was a liar.</i>

157
00:11:21,272 --> 00:11:23,365
<i>She had no diseases at all.</i>

158
00:11:23,442 --> 00:11:27,241
<i>I had seen her at Free And Clear,
my blood parasites group, Thursdays.</i>

159
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:30,771
<i>Then at Hope,
my bimonthly sickle-cell circle.</i>

160
00:11:31,283 --> 00:11:36,243
<i>And again, at Seize The Day,
my tuberculosis, Friday night.</i>

161
00:11:37,388 --> 00:11:39,380
<i>Marla,</i>

162
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:41,926
<i>the big tourist.</i>

163
00:11:42,027 --> 00:11:44,120
<i>Her lie reflected my lie.</i>

164
00:11:44,663 --> 00:11:46,723
<i>And suddenly, I felt nothing.</i>

165
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:50,461
<i>I couldn't cry. So once again,</i>

166
00:11:50,536 --> 00:11:52,629
<i>I couldn't sleep.</i>

167
00:12:03,617 --> 00:12:06,085
<i>Next group, after guided meditation,</i>

168
00:12:06,219 --> 00:12:09,620
<i>after we open our heart chakras,
when it's time to hug,</i>

169
00:12:09,689 --> 00:12:12,852
<i>I'm gonna grab that bitch,
Marla Singer, and scream.</i>

170
00:12:12,926 --> 00:12:16,920
Marla, you liar!
You big tourist, I need this! Now, get out!

171
00:12:19,033 --> 00:12:21,432
<i>I hadn't slept in four days.</i>

172
00:12:21,501 --> 00:12:23,367
<i>We'll just let that dry...</i>

173
00:12:23,471 --> 00:12:26,907
<i>When you have insomnia,
you're never really asleep.</i>

174
00:12:26,974 --> 00:12:29,465
<i>And you're never really awake.</i>

175
00:12:30,646 --> 00:12:33,136
To begin tonight's communion,

176
00:12:33,247 --> 00:12:35,943
Chloe would like to say a few words.

177
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:38,985
<i>Oh, yeah. Chloe.</i>

178
00:12:39,888 --> 00:12:44,848
<i>Chloe looked the way Meryl Streep's skeleton
would look if you made it walk around</i>

179
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,986
<i>being extra nice to everybody.</i>

180
00:12:47,496 --> 00:12:49,555
Well, I'm still here.

181
00:12:49,932 --> 00:12:52,060
But I don't know for how long.

182
00:12:52,902 --> 00:12:55,995
That's as much certainty
as anyone can give me.

183
00:12:56,104 --> 00:12:58,072
But I've got some good news.

184
00:12:58,173 --> 00:13:01,905
I no longer have any fear of death.

185
00:13:05,814 --> 00:13:09,581
But... I am in a pretty lonely place.

186
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,713
No-one will have sex with me.

187
00:13:13,891 --> 00:13:18,293
I'm so close to the end,
and all I want is to get laid for the last time.

188
00:13:18,895 --> 00:13:22,354
I have pornographic movies
in my apartment,

189
00:13:22,433 --> 00:13:26,130
- and lubricants and amyl nitrite.
- Thank you, Chloe.

190
00:13:26,836 --> 00:13:28,964
Everyone, let's thank Chloe.

191
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:31,200
Thank you, Chloe.

192
00:13:34,011 --> 00:13:37,845
Now, let's ready ourselves
for guided meditation.

193
00:13:38,983 --> 00:13:42,384
You're standing at the entrance of your cave.

194
00:13:42,853 --> 00:13:46,346
You step inside your cave and you walk...

195
00:13:46,424 --> 00:13:49,551
<i>If I did have a tumor, I'd name it Marla.</i>

196
00:13:50,595 --> 00:13:52,586
<i>Marla.</i>

197
00:13:52,664 --> 00:13:57,124
<i>The scratch on the roof of your mouth
that would heal if you could stop tonguing it.</i>

198
00:13:57,235 --> 00:13:59,328
<i>But you can't.</i>

199
00:14:00,238 --> 00:14:03,071
<i>..deeper into your cave as you walk.</i>

200
00:14:03,174 --> 00:14:06,736
<i>You feel a healing energy all around you.</i>

201
00:14:09,382 --> 00:14:11,440
<i>Now find your power animal.</i>

202
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,378
Slide.

203
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:23,295
OK. Let's partner up.

204
00:14:23,396 --> 00:14:25,694
Pick someone special to you tonight.

205
00:14:31,905 --> 00:14:33,997
Hey.

206
00:14:34,408 --> 00:14:36,467
- We need to talk.
- Sure.

207
00:14:41,281 --> 00:14:43,374
- I'm onto you.
- What?

208
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:46,578
Yeah. You're a faker. You're not dying.

209
00:14:46,653 --> 00:14:48,450
Sorry?

210
00:14:48,522 --> 00:14:53,517
In the Tibetan-philosophy, Sylvia-Plath
sense of the word, I know we're all dying.

211
00:14:53,628 --> 00:14:57,826
- But you're not dying the way Chloe is.
- So?

212
00:14:58,433 --> 00:15:00,492
So you're a tourist.

213
00:15:00,601 --> 00:15:04,800
I've seen you. I saw you at melanoma,
I saw you at tuberculosis.

214
00:15:04,873 --> 00:15:07,397
I saw you at testicular cancer!

215
00:15:07,475 --> 00:15:09,102
I saw you practising this.

216
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:11,645
- Practising what?
- Telling me off.

217
00:15:11,713 --> 00:15:15,547
Is it going as well as you hoped,... Rupert?

218
00:15:15,651 --> 00:15:17,447
I'll expose you.

219
00:15:17,518 --> 00:15:19,612
Go ahead. I'll expose you.

220
00:15:20,355 --> 00:15:23,222
Come together. Let yourselves cry.

221
00:15:30,232 --> 00:15:32,325
Oh, God. Why are you doing this?

222
00:15:32,434 --> 00:15:35,165
It's cheaper than a movie
and there's free coffee.

223
00:15:35,271 --> 00:15:38,034
Look, this is important.
These are my groups.

224
00:15:38,107 --> 00:15:40,234
I've been coming for over a year.

225
00:15:40,342 --> 00:15:43,540
- Why do you do it?
- I don't know.

226
00:15:43,646 --> 00:15:47,480
When people think you're dying,
they listen to you instead of...

227
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:50,542
Instead of waiting for their turn to speak.

228
00:15:51,855 --> 00:15:53,914
Yeah. Yeah.

229
00:15:55,091 --> 00:15:57,959
Share yourself... completely.

230
00:15:58,762 --> 00:16:00,854
Look, you don't want to get into this.

231
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:02,990
- It becomes an addiction.
- Really?

232
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:07,366
I'm not kidding. I can't cry
if another faker is present, and I need this.

233
00:16:07,471 --> 00:16:09,530
You gotta find somewhere else to go.

234
00:16:09,607 --> 00:16:13,168
Candystripe a cancer ward.
It's not my problem.

235
00:16:16,347 --> 00:16:18,407
No, wait a second. Hold on.

236
00:16:18,517 --> 00:16:20,576
We'll split up the week, OK?

237
00:16:20,685 --> 00:16:22,879
You take lymphoma and tuberculosis.

238
00:16:22,953 --> 00:16:26,082
You take tuberculosis.
My smoking doesn't go over at all.

239
00:16:26,158 --> 00:16:29,491
OK. Good. Fine.
Testicular cancer should be no contest.

240
00:16:29,561 --> 00:16:33,497
Technically, I have more right to be there.
You still have your balls.

241
00:16:33,565 --> 00:16:35,931
- You're kidding.
- I dunno. Am I?

242
00:16:36,601 --> 00:16:38,034
No. No.

243
00:16:38,136 --> 00:16:40,765
- What do you want?
- I'll take the parasites.

244
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,638
You can't have both.
Take the blood parasites.

245
00:16:43,743 --> 00:16:48,043
- I want brain parasites.
- I'll take the blood but I want brain dementia.

246
00:16:48,147 --> 00:16:50,911
- I want that.
- You can't have the whole brain.

247
00:16:50,983 --> 00:16:53,508
So far, you have four. I only have two.

248
00:16:53,586 --> 00:16:57,522
OK. Take both the parasites. They're yours.

249
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:59,854
Now we both have three...

250
00:17:02,596 --> 00:17:05,224
Hey! You left half your clothes.

251
00:17:21,782 --> 00:17:23,944
- What, are you selling those?
- Yes!

252
00:17:24,018 --> 00:17:26,077
I'm selling some clothes!

253
00:17:26,187 --> 00:17:28,245
So! We each have three. That's six.

254
00:17:28,355 --> 00:17:31,189
What about the seventh day?
I want bowel cancer.

255
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:33,352
<i>The girl had done her homework.</i>

256
00:17:33,461 --> 00:17:35,554
No. No. I want bowel cancer.

257
00:17:36,197 --> 00:17:38,257
That's your favorite too?

258
00:17:38,367 --> 00:17:41,858
- Tried to slip it by me, eh?
- Look, we'll split it.

259
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:44,029
Take the first and third Sunday.

260
00:17:46,508 --> 00:17:48,373
Deal.

261
00:17:50,979 --> 00:17:53,278
Looks like this is goodbye.

262
00:17:53,382 --> 00:17:55,509
Let's not make a big thing out of it.

263
00:17:55,618 --> 00:17:58,052
How's this for not making a big thing?

264
00:18:01,523 --> 00:18:03,320
Hey, Marla!

265
00:18:03,659 --> 00:18:05,820
Marla!

266
00:18:05,894 --> 00:18:08,489
Maybe we should exchange numbers.

267
00:18:08,598 --> 00:18:10,498
Should we?

268
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:14,660
- We might wanna switch nights.
- OK.

269
00:18:19,843 --> 00:18:22,335
<i>This is how I met Marla Singer.</i>

270
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:28,312
<i>Marla's philosophy of life
was that she might die at any moment.</i>

271
00:18:28,418 --> 00:18:30,717
<i>The tragedy, she said, was that she didn't.</i>

272
00:18:30,821 --> 00:18:34,847
It doesn't have your name!
Who are you? Cornelius? Rupert?

273
00:18:34,924 --> 00:18:38,884
Travis? Any of the stupid names
you give each night?

274
00:18:41,866 --> 00:18:43,925
<i>You wake up at SeaTac.</i>

275
00:18:44,035 --> 00:18:46,970
<i>SFO. LAX.</i>

276
00:18:47,071 --> 00:18:49,437
<i>You wake up at O'Hare.</i>

277
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,668
<i>Dallas Fort Worth.</i>

278
00:18:51,743 --> 00:18:53,711
<i>BWI.</i>

279
00:18:53,779 --> 00:18:57,578
<i>Pacific. Mountain. Central.
Lose an hour. Gain an hour.</i>

280
00:18:57,682 --> 00:19:01,551
The check-in for that flight
isn't for another two hours, sir.

281
00:19:01,653 --> 00:19:04,918
<i>This is your life,
and it's ending one minute at a time.</i>

282
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:07,982
<i>You wake up at Air Harbor International.</i>

283
00:19:09,394 --> 00:19:13,262
<i>If you wake up at a different time,
in a different place,</i>

284
00:19:13,332 --> 00:19:15,995
<i>could you wake up as a different person?</i>

285
00:19:16,102 --> 00:19:18,160
<i>Everywhere I travel,</i>

286
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:20,534
<i>tiny life.</i>

287
00:19:20,605 --> 00:19:23,131
<i>Single-serving sugar and cream.</i>

288
00:19:23,209 --> 00:19:25,006
<i>Single pat of butter.</i>

289
00:19:25,111 --> 00:19:27,944
<i>The microwave cordon bleu hobby kit.</i>

290
00:19:28,014 --> 00:19:29,982
<i>Shampoo-conditioner combos.</i>

291
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:33,951
<i>Sample-package mouthwash.
Tiny bars of soap.</i>

292
00:19:35,388 --> 00:19:37,914
<i>The people I meet on each flight,</i>

293
00:19:37,991 --> 00:19:40,117
<i>they're single-serving friends.</i>

294
00:19:40,193 --> 00:19:43,925
<i>Between takeoff and landing,
we have our time together.</i>

295
00:19:43,997 --> 00:19:46,227
<i>That's all we get.</i>

296
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:48,233
<i>Welcome!</i>

297
00:19:50,337 --> 00:19:54,535
<i>On a long enough time line,
the survival rate for everyone drops to zero.</i>

298
00:19:54,608 --> 00:19:58,340
<i>I was a recall coordinator.
My job was to apply the formula.</i>

299
00:19:58,413 --> 00:20:00,813
The infant went through the windshield.

300
00:20:00,915 --> 00:20:04,976
<i>A new car built by my company
leaves somewhere traveling at 60mph.</i>

301
00:20:05,053 --> 00:20:07,146
<i>The rear differential locks up.</i>

302
00:20:08,189 --> 00:20:10,783
The teenager's braces
are stuck to the ashtray.

303
00:20:10,859 --> 00:20:13,225
Might make a good anti-smoking ad.

304
00:20:13,328 --> 00:20:16,820
<i>The car crashes and burns
with everyone trapped inside.</i>

305
00:20:16,931 --> 00:20:19,195
<i>Now, should we initiate a recall?</i>

306
00:20:19,267 --> 00:20:21,361
The father must have been huge.

307
00:20:21,437 --> 00:20:24,667
See where the fat burned to the seat?
The polyester shirt?

308
00:20:24,773 --> 00:20:26,764
Very modern art.

309
00:20:26,841 --> 00:20:29,333
<i>Take the number of vehicles in the field, A.</i>

310
00:20:29,412 --> 00:20:32,142
<i>Multiply it by the probable rate of failure, B.</i>

311
00:20:32,214 --> 00:20:36,014
<i>Multiply the result by
the average out-of-court settlement, C.</i>

312
00:20:36,085 --> 00:20:38,178
<i>A x B x C</i>

313
00:20:38,387 --> 00:20:40,287
equals X.

314
00:20:40,389 --> 00:20:42,984
If X is less than the cost of a recall,

315
00:20:43,059 --> 00:20:45,084
we don't do one.

316
00:20:45,194 --> 00:20:48,391
Are there a lot of these kinds of accidents?

317
00:20:48,464 --> 00:20:50,399
You wouldn't believe.

318
00:20:51,868 --> 00:20:54,393
Which car company do you work for?

319
00:20:54,471 --> 00:20:56,598
A major one.

320
00:20:59,075 --> 00:21:03,011
<i>Every time the plane banked too sharply
on takeoff or landing,</i>

321
00:21:03,079 --> 00:21:06,379
<i>I prayed for a crash or a midair collision.</i>

322
00:21:07,051 --> 00:21:08,608
<i>Anything.</i>

323
00:21:17,462 --> 00:21:21,193
<i>Life insurance pays off triple
if you die on a business trip.</i>

324
00:21:24,135 --> 00:21:27,435
"If you are seated in an emergency exit row

325
00:21:27,506 --> 00:21:31,032
and would be unable or unwilling
to perform the duties

326
00:21:31,108 --> 00:21:35,546
listed on the safety card, please
ask a flight attendant to reseat you."

327
00:21:37,349 --> 00:21:39,408
It's a lot of responsibility.

328
00:21:39,485 --> 00:21:41,715
Wanna switch seats?

329
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:45,256
No. I'm not sure
I'm the man for that particularjob.

330
00:21:45,324 --> 00:21:49,728
An exit-door procedure at 30,000ft.

331
00:21:49,829 --> 00:21:51,887
The illusion of safety.

332
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:54,223
Yeah. I guess so.

333
00:21:54,299 --> 00:21:57,235
You know why
they put oxygen masks on planes?

334
00:21:57,303 --> 00:22:01,865
- So you can breathe.
- Oxygen gets you high.

335
00:22:02,976 --> 00:22:06,503
In a catastrophic emergency,
you take giant panic breaths.

336
00:22:06,579 --> 00:22:09,104
Suddenly you become euphoric, docile.

337
00:22:09,182 --> 00:22:11,481
You accept your fate.

338
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:14,143
It's all right here.

339
00:22:14,254 --> 00:22:17,383
Emergency water landing, 600mph.

340
00:22:17,491 --> 00:22:20,324
Blank faces. Calm as Hindu cows.

341
00:22:20,394 --> 00:22:22,487
That's...

342
00:22:23,731 --> 00:22:25,995
That's an interesting theory.

343
00:22:28,002 --> 00:22:30,129
- What do you do?
- What do you mean?

344
00:22:30,204 --> 00:22:32,298
What do you do for a living?

345
00:22:32,374 --> 00:22:35,536
Why? So you can pretend you're interested?

346
00:22:38,212 --> 00:22:39,703
OK.

347
00:22:39,781 --> 00:22:42,682
You have
a kind of sick desperation in your laugh.

348
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,980
We have the exact same briefcase.

349
00:22:48,823 --> 00:22:50,814
Soap.

350
00:22:50,926 --> 00:22:54,590
- Sorry?
- I make and I sell soap.

351
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:57,095
The yardstick of civilization.

352
00:22:57,599 --> 00:22:59,567
<i>And this is how I met...</i>

353
00:22:59,701 --> 00:23:01,499
Tyler Durden.

354
00:23:01,571 --> 00:23:06,838
Did you know if you mix gasoline and
frozen orange juice, you can make napalm?

355
00:23:06,943 --> 00:23:09,912
- No, I did not. Is that true?
- That's right.

356
00:23:09,979 --> 00:23:13,813
One can make all kinds of explosives
with simple household items.

357
00:23:13,916 --> 00:23:16,351
- Really?
- If one was so inclined.

358
00:23:21,324 --> 00:23:26,388
Tyler, you are by far the most interesting
single-serving friend I have ever met.

359
00:23:28,265 --> 00:23:32,395
- Everything on a plane is single-serving...
- Oh, I get it. Very clever.

360
00:23:32,469 --> 00:23:34,027
Thank you.

361
00:23:34,137 --> 00:23:36,230
How's it working out for you?

362
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:39,071
- What?
- Being clever?

363
00:23:39,177 --> 00:23:41,542
Great.

364
00:23:41,612 --> 00:23:44,604
Keep it up, then. Right up.

365
00:23:45,817 --> 00:23:47,978
A question of etiquette.

366
00:23:48,052 --> 00:23:51,044
As I pass, do I give you the ass or the crotch?

367
00:23:58,096 --> 00:24:00,429
<i>How I came to live with Tyler is...</i>

368
00:24:00,499 --> 00:24:04,798
<i>Airlines have this policy
about vibrating luggage.</i>

369
00:24:12,478 --> 00:24:17,108
- Was it ticking?
- Throwers know modern bombs don't tick.

370
00:24:17,216 --> 00:24:20,379
- Sorry, throwers?
- Baggage handlers.

371
00:24:20,452 --> 00:24:22,683
But when a suitcase vibrates,

372
00:24:22,822 --> 00:24:25,483
the throwers have got to call the police.

373
00:24:25,591 --> 00:24:29,083
- My suitcase was vibrating?
- Nine times out of ten

374
00:24:29,194 --> 00:24:31,254
it's an electric razor.

375
00:24:31,331 --> 00:24:33,458
But... every once in a while

376
00:24:36,402 --> 00:24:38,462
it's a dildo.

377
00:24:39,239 --> 00:24:43,300
It's company policy never to imply
ownership in the event of a dildo.

378
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:47,278
<i>We have to use the indefinite article,
a dildo, never</i>

379
00:24:47,347 --> 00:24:49,440
<i>your dildo.</i>

380
00:24:49,516 --> 00:24:51,610
I don't own...

381
00:24:54,288 --> 00:24:57,416
<i>I had everything in that suitcase.
My CK shirts.</i>

382
00:24:57,491 --> 00:25:00,654
<i>My DKNYshoes. My AX ties.</i>

383
00:25:02,329 --> 00:25:04,661
<i>Never mind.</i>

384
00:25:06,535 --> 00:25:09,264
Hey! That's my car!

385
00:25:15,577 --> 00:25:17,545
<i>Home was a condo on the 15th floor</i>

386
00:25:17,646 --> 00:25:20,671
<i>of a filing cabinet
for widows and professionals.</i>

387
00:25:20,748 --> 00:25:23,377
<i>The walls were solid concrete.</i>

388
00:25:23,485 --> 00:25:25,544
<i>A foot of concrete is important</i>

389
00:25:25,654 --> 00:25:29,921
<i>when your next-door neighbor
has to watch game shows at full volume.</i>

390
00:25:29,992 --> 00:25:33,893
<i>Or when a blast of debris
that used to be your personal effects</i>

391
00:25:33,962 --> 00:25:37,990
<i>blows out of your windows
and sails flaming into the night.</i>

392
00:25:44,474 --> 00:25:46,738
<i>I suppose these things happen.</i>

393
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:01,683
There's... nothing up there.

394
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:05,160
You can't go into the unit. Police orders.

395
00:26:13,838 --> 00:26:16,362
Do you have somebody you can call?

396
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,567
<i>How embarrassing.</i>

397
00:26:18,642 --> 00:26:21,544
<i>A houseful of condiments and no food.</i>

398
00:26:30,989 --> 00:26:34,756
<i>The police later told me
the pilot light might have gone out</i>

399
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:38,729
<i>letting out just a little bit of gas.</i>

400
00:26:38,797 --> 00:26:41,061
<i>That gas could have filled the condo.</i>

401
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:44,659
<i>1700 square feet with high ceilings
for days and days.</i>

402
00:26:52,878 --> 00:26:56,645
<i>Then the refrigerator's compressor
could have clicked on.</i>

403
00:26:57,751 --> 00:26:59,809
<i>Yeah?</i>

404
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:05,015
<i>I can hear you breathing...</i>

405
00:27:13,667 --> 00:27:17,603
<i>If you ask me now,
I couldn't tell you why I called him.</i>

406
00:28:00,849 --> 00:28:03,080
<i>- Hello?
- Who's this?</i>

407
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,413
<i>- Tyler?
- Who is this?</i>

408
00:28:08,957 --> 00:28:11,153
We met... We met on the airplane.

409
00:28:11,261 --> 00:28:13,491
We had the same suitcase?

410
00:28:13,563 --> 00:28:15,655
The clever guy?

411
00:28:15,731 --> 00:28:18,098
<i>Oh, yeah. Right.</i>

412
00:28:20,103 --> 00:28:22,731
I called a second ago. There was no answer.

413
00:28:22,839 --> 00:28:27,037
<i>- I'm at a payphone.
- Yeah, I *69'd you. I never pick up my phone.</i>

414
00:28:29,779 --> 00:28:31,873
<i>So what's up?</i>

415
00:28:32,549 --> 00:28:34,574
Well.

416
00:28:34,685 --> 00:28:36,744
You're not gonna believe this.

417
00:28:38,888 --> 00:28:41,119
You know, it could be worse.

418
00:28:41,191 --> 00:28:44,957
A woman could cut off your penis
while you sleep and toss it out of a car.

419
00:28:45,796 --> 00:28:49,095
There's always that. I don't know.

420
00:28:49,166 --> 00:28:52,294
When you buy furniture,
you tell yourself, that's it.

421
00:28:52,369 --> 00:28:54,463
That's the last sofa I'll need.

422
00:28:54,539 --> 00:28:57,337
Whatever happens,
that sofa problem is handled.

423
00:28:57,409 --> 00:29:00,866
I had it all.
I had a stereo that was very decent.

424
00:29:00,978 --> 00:29:04,506
A wardrobe that was getting very respectable.

425
00:29:04,582 --> 00:29:06,743
I was close to being complete.

426
00:29:06,818 --> 00:29:09,379
- Shit, man. Now it's all gone.
- All gone.

427
00:29:09,488 --> 00:29:12,217
All gone.

428
00:29:13,491 --> 00:29:15,516
Do you know what a duvet is?

429
00:29:15,593 --> 00:29:18,495
- A comforter.
- It's a blanket.

430
00:29:18,564 --> 00:29:22,556
Just a blanket. Why do guys
like you and I know what a duvet is?

431
00:29:22,634 --> 00:29:26,799
Is this essential to our survival
in the hunter-gatherer sense?

432
00:29:26,906 --> 00:29:28,533
No.

433
00:29:28,607 --> 00:29:30,598
What are we, then?

434
00:29:30,711 --> 00:29:33,304
I dunno. Consumers.

435
00:29:33,379 --> 00:29:35,438
Right. We're consumers.

436
00:29:35,548 --> 00:29:38,814
We are by-products of a lifestyle obsession.

437
00:29:38,919 --> 00:29:42,820
Murder, crime, poverty.
These things don't concern me.

438
00:29:42,922 --> 00:29:46,359
What concerns me are celebrity magazines,

439
00:29:46,426 --> 00:29:48,519
television with 500 channels,

440
00:29:48,595 --> 00:29:51,257
some guy's name on my underwear. Rogaine.

441
00:29:51,365 --> 00:29:53,425
Viagra. Olestra.

442
00:29:53,534 --> 00:29:56,366
- Martha Stewart.
- Fuck Martha Stewart.

443
00:29:56,436 --> 00:29:59,928
She's polishing the brass on the Titanic.
It's all going down.

444
00:30:00,041 --> 00:30:03,772
So fuck off with your sofa units
and Strinne green stripe patterns.

445
00:30:03,845 --> 00:30:07,177
I say never be complete.

446
00:30:07,247 --> 00:30:09,273
I say stop being perfect.

447
00:30:09,384 --> 00:30:11,409
I say let's evolve.

448
00:30:11,486 --> 00:30:13,784
Let the chips fall where they may.

449
00:30:15,957 --> 00:30:18,050
But that's me, and I could be wrong.

450
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:20,218
Maybe it's a terrible tragedy.

451
00:30:20,294 --> 00:30:22,786
It's just stuff. Not a tragedy...

452
00:30:22,865 --> 00:30:26,631
You did lose a lot of versatile solutions
for modern living.

453
00:30:26,701 --> 00:30:29,295
Fuck, you're right. I don't smoke.

454
00:30:32,674 --> 00:30:36,440
My insurance is probably gonna cover it, so...

455
00:30:38,881 --> 00:30:41,008
What?

456
00:30:41,116 --> 00:30:44,245
The things you own end up owning you.

457
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:49,648
Do what you like, man.

458
00:30:50,392 --> 00:30:52,827
Oh, it's late.

459
00:30:52,896 --> 00:30:55,626
- Hey, thanks for the beer.
- Yeah, man.

460
00:30:55,698 --> 00:30:57,791
I should find a hotel.

461
00:30:58,535 --> 00:31:00,628
What?

462
00:31:00,703 --> 00:31:02,330
What?

463
00:31:02,439 --> 00:31:04,498
- A hotel?
- Yeah.

464
00:31:04,607 --> 00:31:07,668
- Just ask, man.
- What are you talking about?

465
00:31:07,745 --> 00:31:11,510
Oh, God. Three pitchers of beer
and you still can't ask.

466
00:31:12,515 --> 00:31:14,143
What?

467
00:31:14,251 --> 00:31:16,879
You called me
because you needed a place to stay.

468
00:31:16,954 --> 00:31:20,412
- Oh, hey. No, no, no.
- Yes, you did. So just ask.

469
00:31:20,491 --> 00:31:23,051
Cut the foreplay and just ask, man.

470
00:31:24,862 --> 00:31:27,126
Would... Would that be a problem?

471
00:31:27,231 --> 00:31:29,291
Is it a problem for you to ask?

472
00:31:30,302 --> 00:31:32,531
- Can I stay at your place?
- Yeah.

473
00:31:33,904 --> 00:31:35,964
Thanks.

474
00:31:40,145 --> 00:31:43,138
- I want you to do me a favor.
- Yeah, sure.

475
00:31:43,249 --> 00:31:45,648
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.

476
00:31:45,717 --> 00:31:47,685
What?

477
00:31:47,752 --> 00:31:51,587
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.

478
00:31:51,691 --> 00:31:54,591
<i>Let me tell you a little bit about Tyler Durden.</i>

479
00:31:54,793 --> 00:31:57,159
<i>Tyler was a night person.</i>

480
00:31:57,262 --> 00:31:59,493
While the rest of us slept, he worked.

481
00:31:59,565 --> 00:32:02,728
He had one part-time job as a projectionist.

482
00:32:02,802 --> 00:32:05,794
A movie doesn't come all on one big reel.
It comes on a few.

483
00:32:05,905 --> 00:32:09,602
Someone has to switch the projectors
at the exact moment

484
00:32:09,709 --> 00:32:12,941
that one reel ends and the next one begins.

485
00:32:13,013 --> 00:32:16,948
You can see little dots come into
the upper right corner of the screen.

486
00:32:17,016 --> 00:32:19,747
In the industry, we call them cigarette burns.

487
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:21,913
That's the cue for a changeover.

488
00:32:21,989 --> 00:32:26,756
He flips the projectors, movie keeps
going and the audience has no idea.

489
00:32:26,827 --> 00:32:29,091
Why would anyone want this shitjob?

490
00:32:29,196 --> 00:32:32,359
Because it affords him
interesting opportunities.

491
00:32:32,432 --> 00:32:35,960
Like splicing a frame of pornography
into family films.

492
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:41,030
So when the snooty cat and the courageous
dog with the celebrity voices first meet,

493
00:32:41,175 --> 00:32:45,374
that's when you'll catch a flash
of Tyler's contribution to the film.

494
00:32:52,253 --> 00:32:54,847
Nobody knows that they saw it but they did.

495
00:32:54,956 --> 00:32:57,517
Nice, big cock.

496
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:05,061
Even a hummingbird
couldn't catch Tyler at work.

497
00:33:10,406 --> 00:33:15,434
Tyler also works sometimes as a banquet
waiter at the luxurious Pressman hotel.

498
00:33:20,083 --> 00:33:24,143
<i>He was the guerrilla terrorist
of the food service industry.</i>

499
00:33:24,253 --> 00:33:26,552
Do not watch. I cannot go when you watch.

500
00:33:26,623 --> 00:33:31,026
Apart from seasoning the lobster bisque,
he farted on meringues,

501
00:33:31,094 --> 00:33:33,654
and as for the cream of mushroom soup...

502
00:33:33,763 --> 00:33:35,788
Go ahead, tell 'em.

503
00:33:35,865 --> 00:33:37,856
You get the idea.

504
00:33:38,068 --> 00:33:41,300
- You just want me to hit you?
- Come on. Do me this one favor.

505
00:33:41,405 --> 00:33:44,771
- Why?
- I don't know. Never been in a fight. You?

506
00:33:44,841 --> 00:33:48,835
- No. But that's a good thing.
- You can't know yourself if you haven't!

507
00:33:48,913 --> 00:33:51,279
I don't wanna die without any scars.

508
00:33:51,382 --> 00:33:55,648
- Come on. Hit me, before I lose my nerve.
- Oh, God. This is crazy.

509
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:58,018
So go crazy! Let it rip.

510
00:33:58,089 --> 00:34:00,785
- I don't know about this.
- I don't either.

511
00:34:00,858 --> 00:34:03,919
Who gives a shit? No-one's watching.
What do you care?

512
00:34:04,029 --> 00:34:06,496
This is crazy. You want me to hit you?!

513
00:34:06,597 --> 00:34:08,656
That's right.

514
00:34:08,733 --> 00:34:11,931
- Where? Like, in the face?
- Surprise me.

515
00:34:14,106 --> 00:34:16,199
This is so fucking stupid.

516
00:34:27,086 --> 00:34:29,280
Motherfucker!

517
00:34:29,354 --> 00:34:31,447
He hit me in the ear!

518
00:34:31,523 --> 00:34:34,721
- Well, Jesus, I'm sorry.
- Ow, Christ!

519
00:34:34,827 --> 00:34:36,886
- Why the ear, man?
- I fucked it up.

520
00:34:36,963 --> 00:34:38,692
No, that was perfect.

521
00:34:51,577 --> 00:34:53,704
No, it's all right.

522
00:34:54,548 --> 00:34:56,641
It really hurts.

523
00:34:57,084 --> 00:34:59,143
Right.

524
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,715
Hit me again.

525
00:35:01,789 --> 00:35:03,916
No, you hit me. Come on!

526
00:35:20,875 --> 00:35:23,366
We should do this again sometime.

527
00:35:36,157 --> 00:35:38,388
- Where's your car?
- What car?

528
00:35:48,904 --> 00:35:51,236
<i>I don't know how Tyler found that house</i>

529
00:35:51,374 --> 00:35:53,605
<i>but he said he'd been there for a year.</i>

530
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:56,576
<i>It looked like it was waiting to be torn down.</i>

531
00:35:56,645 --> 00:35:59,045
<i>Most of the windows were boarded up.</i>

532
00:35:59,148 --> 00:36:04,519
<i>There was no lock on the front door from
when the police, or whoever, kicked it in.</i>

533
00:36:04,588 --> 00:36:06,647
<i>The stairs were ready to collapse.</i>

534
00:36:06,757 --> 00:36:09,248
<i>I didn't know if he owned it or was squatting.</i>

535
00:36:09,393 --> 00:36:11,861
<i>Neither would have surprised me.</i>

536
00:36:12,763 --> 00:36:14,823
Yep. That's you.

537
00:36:14,932 --> 00:36:17,526
That's me. That's the toilet. Good?

538
00:36:17,602 --> 00:36:19,660
Yeah, thanks.

539
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:21,670
<i>What a shithole.</i>

540
00:36:21,772 --> 00:36:23,741
<i>Nothing worked.</i>

541
00:36:27,378 --> 00:36:31,280
<i>Turning on one light meant
another light in the house went out.</i>

542
00:36:31,416 --> 00:36:35,147
<i>There were no neighbors.
Just warehouses and a paper mill.</i>

543
00:36:35,219 --> 00:36:39,213
<i>That fart smell of steam.
The hamster-cage smell of wood chips.</i>

544
00:36:40,992 --> 00:36:43,392
What have we here?

545
00:36:58,177 --> 00:37:00,271
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

546
00:37:11,257 --> 00:37:14,317
<i>Every time it rained, we had to kill the power.</i>

547
00:37:15,228 --> 00:37:18,629
<i>By the end of the first month,
I didn't miss TV.</i>

548
00:37:19,666 --> 00:37:23,000
<i>I didn't even mind the warm, stale refrigerator.</i>

549
00:37:35,348 --> 00:37:37,476
Can I be next?

550
00:37:41,889 --> 00:37:43,949
All right, man.

551
00:37:44,059 --> 00:37:46,049
Lose the tie.

552
00:37:50,064 --> 00:37:54,468
<i>At night, Tyler and I were alone
for half a mile in every direction.</i>

553
00:37:59,908 --> 00:38:03,844
<i>Rain trickled down through
the plaster and the light fixtures.</i>

554
00:38:03,912 --> 00:38:06,746
<i>Everything wooden swelled and shrank.</i>

555
00:38:06,849 --> 00:38:10,045
<i>Everywhere were rusted nails
to snag your elbow on.</i>

556
00:38:10,118 --> 00:38:12,713
<i>The previous occupant had been a shut-in.</i>

557
00:38:12,788 --> 00:38:14,881
Hey, man. What are you reading?

558
00:38:14,957 --> 00:38:19,325
Listen to this. It's an article written
by an organ in the first person.

559
00:38:19,394 --> 00:38:22,159
"I am Jack's medulla oblongata.
Without me,

560
00:38:22,265 --> 00:38:25,723
Jack could not regulate
his heart rate or breathing."

561
00:38:25,801 --> 00:38:27,895
There's a whole series of these.

562
00:38:27,971 --> 00:38:30,063
"I Am Jill's Nipples."

563
00:38:32,074 --> 00:38:36,068
- "I Am Jack's Colon."
- "I Get Cancer. I Kill Jack."

564
00:38:39,316 --> 00:38:43,116
<i>After fighting, everything else
in life got the volume turned down.</i>

565
00:38:45,122 --> 00:38:46,817
What?

566
00:38:46,924 --> 00:38:50,486
<i>- You could deal with anything.
- Have you finished those reports?</i>

567
00:38:55,132 --> 00:38:57,727
<i>If you could choose,
who would you fight?</i>

568
00:38:57,802 --> 00:38:59,895
I'd fight my boss, probably.

569
00:38:59,971 --> 00:39:02,098
Really?

570
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:05,540
- Yeah, why? Who would you fight?
- I'd fight my dad.

571
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:07,703
I don't know my dad.

572
00:39:07,779 --> 00:39:09,713
I mean, I know him, but...

573
00:39:09,781 --> 00:39:12,148
He left when I was like, six years old.

574
00:39:12,217 --> 00:39:15,208
Married this other woman
and had some other kids.

575
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,379
He did this every six years.

576
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:21,619
- He changes city and starts a new family.
- Fucker's setting up franchises!

577
00:39:22,428 --> 00:39:24,554
My dad never went to college.

578
00:39:24,629 --> 00:39:28,566
- So it was real important that I go.
- That sounds familiar.

579
00:39:28,634 --> 00:39:33,072
So I graduate. Call him up long-distance
and say, "Dad, now what?"

580
00:39:33,173 --> 00:39:35,164
- He says, "Get ajob."
- Same here.

581
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,936
Now I'm 25. Make my yearly call again.

582
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:40,001
"Dad, now what?"

583
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:42,207
He says, "I dunno. Get married."

584
00:39:42,282 --> 00:39:45,774
You can't get married.

585
00:39:46,552 --> 00:39:48,612
I'm a 30-year-old boy.

586
00:39:48,688 --> 00:39:51,179
We're a generation of men raised by women.

587
00:39:51,257 --> 00:39:55,558
I'm wondering if another woman
is really the answer we need.

588
00:40:01,568 --> 00:40:04,766
<i>Most of the week, we were Ozzie and Harriet.</i>

589
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:09,075
<i>But every Saturday night,
we were finding something out.</i>

590
00:40:10,277 --> 00:40:13,769
<i>We were finding out more and more
that we were not alone.</i>

591
00:40:17,686 --> 00:40:22,315
<i>It used to be that when I came home angry
or depressed, I'd just clean my condo.</i>

592
00:40:22,423 --> 00:40:24,483
<i>Polish my Scandinavian furniture.</i>

593
00:40:24,626 --> 00:40:29,654
<i>I should have been looking for a new condo
or haggling with my insurance company.</i>

594
00:40:29,731 --> 00:40:33,497
<i>I should have been upset
about my nice flaming little shit.</i>

595
00:40:33,635 --> 00:40:35,500
<i>But I wasn't.</i>

596
00:40:35,637 --> 00:40:39,267
The premise of cybernetting an office
is make things more efficient.

597
00:40:39,342 --> 00:40:42,208
<i>Monday mornings,
I just thought about next week.</i>

598
00:40:42,277 --> 00:40:45,303
Can I get the icon in cornflower blue?

599
00:40:45,414 --> 00:40:46,507
Absolutely.

600
00:40:46,649 --> 00:40:49,880
Efficiency is priority No.1, people.

601
00:40:50,019 --> 00:40:52,816
Because waste is a thief.

602
00:40:52,888 --> 00:40:56,017
I showed this to my man here.
You liked it, didn't you?

603
00:40:59,696 --> 00:41:03,632
<i>You can swallow a pint of blood
before you get sick.</i>

604
00:41:04,667 --> 00:41:06,897
<i>It was right in everyone's face.</i>

605
00:41:06,969 --> 00:41:09,131
<i>Tyler and I just made it visible.</i>

606
00:41:09,239 --> 00:41:11,673
<i>It was on the tip of everyone's tongue.</i>

607
00:41:11,742 --> 00:41:13,835
<i>Tyler and I just gave it a name.</i>

608
00:41:25,055 --> 00:41:27,114
Come on, you've gotta go home!

609
00:41:49,347 --> 00:41:51,679
Turn off the jukebox. Lock the back.

610
00:42:12,571 --> 00:42:16,303
<i>Every week,
Tyler gave the rules that he and I decided.</i>

611
00:42:16,376 --> 00:42:18,435
Gentlemen!

612
00:42:19,212 --> 00:42:21,304
Welcome to Fight Club.

613
00:42:23,416 --> 00:42:25,577
The first rule of Fight Club is

614
00:42:25,719 --> 00:42:28,051
you do not talk about Fight Club.

615
00:42:28,155 --> 00:42:30,750
The second rule of Fight Club is

616
00:42:31,158 --> 00:42:34,594
you do not talk about Fight Club!

617
00:42:34,728 --> 00:42:36,993
Third rule of Fight Club.

618
00:42:37,064 --> 00:42:39,862
Someone yells stop, goes limp, taps out,

619
00:42:39,967 --> 00:42:42,730
the fight is over. Fourth rule.

620
00:42:42,803 --> 00:42:45,136
Only two guys to a fight.

621
00:42:45,206 --> 00:42:47,071
Fifth rule.

622
00:42:47,175 --> 00:42:49,837
One fight at a time, fellas.

623
00:42:49,944 --> 00:42:52,413
Sixth rule. No shirts. No shoes.

624
00:42:52,481 --> 00:42:56,416
Seventh rule.
Fights will go on as long as they have to.

625
00:42:58,252 --> 00:43:00,847
And the eighth and final rule.

626
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:05,186
If this is your first night at Fight Club

627
00:43:05,259 --> 00:43:07,353
you have to fight.

628
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,460
<i>This kid from work, Ricky,</i>

629
00:43:13,570 --> 00:43:18,063
<i>couldn't remember whether
you ordered pens with blue ink or black.</i>

630
00:43:18,173 --> 00:43:20,573
<i>But Ricky was a god for ten minutes</i>

631
00:43:20,642 --> 00:43:24,010
<i>when he trounced
the maitre d' of a local food court.</i>

632
00:43:25,881 --> 00:43:31,218
<i>Sometimes, all you could hear were the flat,
hard, packing sounds over the yelling.</i>

633
00:43:34,991 --> 00:43:38,017
<i>Or the wet choke
when someone gasped and sprayed...</i>

634
00:43:38,094 --> 00:43:40,119
Stop!

635
00:43:40,230 --> 00:43:43,098
<i>You weren't alive anywhere
like you were there.</i>

636
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:48,000
<i>But Fight Club only exists in the hours
between when Fight Club starts and ends.</i>

637
00:43:48,504 --> 00:43:51,531
<i>Even if I could tell someone
they had a good fight,</i>

638
00:43:51,642 --> 00:43:53,940
<i>I wouldn't be talking to the same man.</i>

639
00:43:54,044 --> 00:43:57,343
<i>Who you were in Fight Club
is not who you were outside of it.</i>

640
00:43:57,448 --> 00:44:02,476
<i>A guy came to Fight Club for the first time.
His ass was a wad of cookie dough.</i>

641
00:44:02,553 --> 00:44:05,421
<i>After a few weeks, he was carved out of wood.</i>

642
00:44:06,258 --> 00:44:09,455
If you could fight any celebrity,
who would you fight?

643
00:44:09,526 --> 00:44:12,655
- Alive or dead?
- Doesn't matter. Who'd be tough?

644
00:44:13,565 --> 00:44:16,693
Hemingway. You?

645
00:44:17,335 --> 00:44:20,498
Shatner. I'd fight William Shatner.

646
00:44:21,539 --> 00:44:24,770
<i>We all started seeing things differently.</i>

647
00:44:26,044 --> 00:44:29,378
<i>Everywhere we went,
we were sizing things up.</i>

648
00:44:32,717 --> 00:44:35,881
<i>I felt sorry for guys packed into gyms,</i>

649
00:44:35,955 --> 00:44:40,051
<i>trying to look like how Calvin Klein
or Tommy Hilfiger said they should.</i>

650
00:44:40,126 --> 00:44:42,254
Is that what a man looks like?

651
00:44:43,162 --> 00:44:45,995
Oh, self-improvement is masturbation.

652
00:44:46,098 --> 00:44:48,157
Now, self-destruction...

653
00:44:48,267 --> 00:44:50,259
Excuse me.

654
00:45:24,906 --> 00:45:28,103
<i>Fight Club wasn't about winning or losing.</i>

655
00:45:28,176 --> 00:45:30,235
<i>It wasn't about words.</i>

656
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:35,639
<i>The hysterical shouting was in tongues</i>

657
00:45:35,751 --> 00:45:37,718
<i>like at a Pentecostal Church.</i>

658
00:45:42,257 --> 00:45:44,350
- Is that it?
- Stop!

659
00:45:44,426 --> 00:45:47,327
<i>When the fight was over, nothing was solved.</i>

660
00:45:47,396 --> 00:45:49,330
<i>But nothing mattered.</i>

661
00:45:49,398 --> 00:45:52,196
Cool.

662
00:45:52,267 --> 00:45:55,066
<i>Afterwards, we all felt saved.</i>

663
00:45:56,006 --> 00:45:58,270
Hey, man. How about next week?

664
00:45:58,375 --> 00:46:00,433
How about next month?!

665
00:46:00,542 --> 00:46:02,602
Irvine, you're in the middle.

666
00:46:02,679 --> 00:46:04,738
New guy, you too.

667
00:46:06,483 --> 00:46:08,644
<i>Sometimes, Tyler spoke for me.</i>

668
00:46:08,752 --> 00:46:10,845
He fell down some stairs.

669
00:46:11,488 --> 00:46:13,581
I fell down some stairs.

670
00:46:15,425 --> 00:46:20,090
<i>Fight Club became the reason to cut
your hair short or trim your fingernails.</i>

671
00:46:20,197 --> 00:46:22,664
OK. Any historical figure.

672
00:46:22,766 --> 00:46:24,632
I'd fight Gandhi.

673
00:46:25,269 --> 00:46:27,100
Good answer.

674
00:46:27,204 --> 00:46:29,434
- How about you?
- Lincoln.

675
00:46:29,507 --> 00:46:32,102
Lincoln?

676
00:46:32,209 --> 00:46:35,804
Big guy, big reach.
Skinny guys fight till they're burger.

677
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:38,773
Fuck!

678
00:46:39,985 --> 00:46:42,647
Hey, even the Mona Lisa's falling apart.

679
00:46:51,730 --> 00:46:53,129
Hello?

680
00:46:53,231 --> 00:46:55,631
<i>Where have you been the last eight weeks?</i>

681
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:57,031
<i>Marla?</i>

682
00:47:00,005 --> 00:47:03,134
<i>- How did you find me?
- You left a forwarding number.</i>

683
00:47:03,242 --> 00:47:06,233
I haven't seen you at any support groups.

684
00:47:06,311 --> 00:47:09,509
<i>We split 'em up.
That was the idea. Remember?</i>

685
00:47:09,615 --> 00:47:12,448
Yeah, but you haven't been going to yours.

686
00:47:12,518 --> 00:47:16,045
- How do you know?
- I cheated.

687
00:47:16,122 --> 00:47:17,953
I found a new one.

688
00:47:18,491 --> 00:47:20,755
- Really?
- It's for men only.

689
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:22,452
Like the testicle thing?

690
00:47:26,233 --> 00:47:28,257
Look, this is a bad time.

691
00:47:28,334 --> 00:47:30,769
I've been going to Debtors Anonymous.

692
00:47:30,871 --> 00:47:34,432
<i>- They're really fucked-up people...
- I'm on my way out.</i>

693
00:47:34,508 --> 00:47:36,874
Me too. I've got a stomach full of Xanax.

694
00:47:36,977 --> 00:47:39,275
I took what was left of a bottle.

695
00:47:39,346 --> 00:47:41,439
It might have been too much.

696
00:47:41,515 --> 00:47:45,144
<i>Picture Marla Singer throw herself
around her crummy apartment.</i>

697
00:47:45,286 --> 00:47:49,745
This isn't a for-real suicide thing.
This is probably a cry-for-help thing.

698
00:47:49,857 --> 00:47:52,759
So you're staying in tonight, then?

699
00:47:52,861 --> 00:47:55,694
Do you wanna wait
and hear me describe death?

700
00:47:55,763 --> 00:48:00,291
<i>Do you wanna listen
and see if my spirit can use a phone?</i>

701
00:48:02,537 --> 00:48:05,199
<i>Have you ever heard a death rattle before?</i>

702
00:48:31,501 --> 00:48:36,335
<i>Tyler's door was closed. I'd been here for
two months and his door was never closed.</i>

703
00:48:41,344 --> 00:48:44,404
You won't believe this dream
I had last night.

704
00:48:44,514 --> 00:48:47,779
I can hardly believe anything about last night.

705
00:48:57,594 --> 00:48:59,563
What are you doing here?

706
00:49:02,266 --> 00:49:04,359
What?

707
00:49:04,435 --> 00:49:06,869
This is my house.
What are you doing here?

708
00:49:09,273 --> 00:49:11,264
Fuck you!

709
00:49:25,891 --> 00:49:29,258
Oh, you've got some fucked-up friends!

710
00:49:29,361 --> 00:49:31,352
Limber, though.

711
00:49:31,430 --> 00:49:33,421
Silly cooze.

712
00:49:34,499 --> 00:49:37,230
I come in last night. Phone's off the hook.

713
00:49:37,303 --> 00:49:39,395
Guess who's on the other end?

714
00:49:39,471 --> 00:49:41,666
<i>I knew the story before he told me.</i>

715
00:49:43,977 --> 00:49:47,572
<i>Have you ever heard a death rattle before?</i>

716
00:49:47,647 --> 00:49:50,480
Do you think it'll live up to its name?

717
00:49:50,583 --> 00:49:54,178
<i>Or will it just be a death hairball?</i>

718
00:49:57,591 --> 00:50:01,583
<i>Prepare to evacuate soul.</i>

719
00:50:01,661 --> 00:50:03,288
<i>Ten,</i>

720
00:50:03,396 --> 00:50:06,195
<i>nine,... eight...</i>

721
00:50:06,267 --> 00:50:08,497
<i>How could Tyler, of all people,</i>

722
00:50:08,602 --> 00:50:12,470
<i>think it was a bad thing
that Marla Singer was about to die?</i>

723
00:50:12,539 --> 00:50:14,200
<i>Five,</i>

724
00:50:14,275 --> 00:50:15,867
<i>four...</i>

725
00:50:16,644 --> 00:50:18,703
Hang on.

726
00:50:24,151 --> 00:50:26,483
You got here fast.

727
00:50:28,023 --> 00:50:30,116
Did I call you?

728
00:50:40,835 --> 00:50:43,930
The mattress is all sealed in slippery plastic.

729
00:50:47,175 --> 00:50:49,576
Oh, don't worry. It's not a threat to you.

730
00:50:52,381 --> 00:50:54,281
Oh, fuck!

731
00:50:54,350 --> 00:50:56,443
Somebody called the cops.

732
00:51:08,364 --> 00:51:11,857
- Hey, where's 513?
- End of the hall.

733
00:51:12,669 --> 00:51:16,537
The girl who lives there
used to be a charming, lovely girl.

734
00:51:16,606 --> 00:51:18,767
She has lost faith in herself.

735
00:51:18,875 --> 00:51:21,708
- Miss Singer, let us help you!
- She's a monster!

736
00:51:21,778 --> 00:51:25,909
- You have every reason to live.
- She's infectious human waste!

737
00:51:25,983 --> 00:51:29,782
- Miss Singer!
- Good luck trying to save her!

738
00:51:34,592 --> 00:51:36,787
If I fall asleep,

739
00:51:36,894 --> 00:51:39,158
I'm done for.

740
00:51:41,132 --> 00:51:43,327
You're gonna have to keep me up

741
00:51:43,401 --> 00:51:45,494
all night.

742
00:51:45,570 --> 00:51:47,903
Un-fucking-believable.

743
00:51:47,973 --> 00:51:50,168
<i>He was obviously able to handle it.</i>

744
00:51:50,242 --> 00:51:53,938
- You know what I mean, you fucked her.
- No, I didn't.

745
00:51:54,011 --> 00:51:56,139
- Never?
- No.

746
00:51:57,049 --> 00:51:59,176
You're not into her, are you?

747
00:51:59,251 --> 00:52:01,343
No! God, not at all.

748
00:52:01,419 --> 00:52:04,014
<i>I am Jack's raging bile duct.</i>

749
00:52:04,156 --> 00:52:06,056
Are you sure? You can tell me.

750
00:52:06,191 --> 00:52:08,022
Believe me, I'm sure.

751
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:11,426
<i>- Put a gun to my head and spray my brains.
- That's good.</i>

752
00:52:11,531 --> 00:52:14,260
She's a predator posing as a house pet.
Stay away.

753
00:52:16,235 --> 00:52:19,865
The shit that came out of
this woman's mouth, I had never heard!

754
00:52:19,973 --> 00:52:21,634
My God.

755
00:52:21,741 --> 00:52:25,074
I haven't been fucked like that
since grade school.

756
00:52:25,211 --> 00:52:27,645
<i>How could Tyler not go for that?</i>

757
00:52:27,747 --> 00:52:31,274
<i>The other night,
he was splicing sex organs into Cinderella.</i>

758
00:52:31,384 --> 00:52:34,183
Marla doesn't need a lover,
just a caseworker.

759
00:52:34,254 --> 00:52:36,848
Or a wash.
This isn't love, it's sport fucking.

760
00:52:36,956 --> 00:52:39,824
<i>She invaded my support groups
and now my home.</i>

761
00:52:39,894 --> 00:52:41,987
Hey, hey. Sit down.

762
00:52:46,065 --> 00:52:49,502
Now, listen.
I can't have you talking to her about me.

763
00:52:49,603 --> 00:52:51,434
Why would I...

764
00:52:51,505 --> 00:52:56,875
Say anything about me or what goes on
in this house to her or anybody,... we're done.

765
00:52:56,977 --> 00:52:59,639
- Now promise me. You promise?
- OK.

766
00:52:59,713 --> 00:53:01,841
- Yeah, I promise.
- Promise?

767
00:53:01,917 --> 00:53:05,318
- I just said, I promise! What...
- That's three times you promised.

768
00:53:06,822 --> 00:53:10,815
<i>If only I had wasted a few minutes
and gone to watch Marla Singer die,</i>

769
00:53:10,892 --> 00:53:12,985
<i>none of this would have happened.</i>

770
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:20,834
Harder, yes! Oh, harder, harder!

771
00:53:27,443 --> 00:53:29,910
<i>I could have moved to another room.</i>

772
00:53:31,047 --> 00:53:34,881
<i>On the third floor
where I might not have heard them.</i>

773
00:53:34,951 --> 00:53:37,044
<i>But I didn't.</i>

774
00:54:01,279 --> 00:54:05,374
- What are you doing?
- Just going to bed.

775
00:54:05,482 --> 00:54:07,542
Wanna finish her off?

776
00:54:10,455 --> 00:54:13,981
- No. No, thank you.
- I've found a cigarette.

777
00:54:14,091 --> 00:54:17,459
- Who were you talking to?
- Shut up.

778
00:54:17,529 --> 00:54:20,794
<i>I became the calm little center of the world.</i>

779
00:54:21,466 --> 00:54:23,526
<i>I was the Zen master.</i>

780
00:54:28,673 --> 00:54:30,665
<i>I wrote little haiku poems.</i>

781
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:33,608
<i>I e-mailed them to everyone.</i>

782
00:54:33,712 --> 00:54:35,804
Is that your blood?

783
00:54:37,516 --> 00:54:39,575
Some of it, yeah.

784
00:54:39,685 --> 00:54:42,347
You can't smoke in here.

785
00:54:42,421 --> 00:54:44,515
Take the rest of the day off.

786
00:54:44,591 --> 00:54:47,115
Come back Monday with some clean clothes.

787
00:54:47,192 --> 00:54:49,319
Get yourself together.

788
00:54:49,695 --> 00:54:52,028
<i>I got right in everyone's hostile face.</i>

789
00:54:52,132 --> 00:54:54,623
<i>"Yes, these are bruises from fighting."</i>

790
00:54:54,734 --> 00:54:56,793
<i>"Yes, I'm comfortable with that."</i>

791
00:54:56,902 --> 00:54:58,768
<i>"I am enlightened."</i>

792
00:55:00,707 --> 00:55:05,838
<i>You give up the condo life, give up
all your flaming worldly possessions,</i>

793
00:55:05,946 --> 00:55:09,006
<i>move to a dilapidated house
in a toxic waste area,</i>

794
00:55:09,115 --> 00:55:12,983
<i>and you have to come home to this.</i>

795
00:55:23,631 --> 00:55:27,032
<i>- Hello.
- This is Detective Stern with the Arson Unit.</i>

796
00:55:27,134 --> 00:55:31,366
<i>We have some new information about
the incident at your former condo.</i>

797
00:55:31,439 --> 00:55:32,736
Yes.

798
00:55:32,807 --> 00:55:37,745
I don't know if you're aware, but someone
sprayed Freon into your front-door lock.

799
00:55:37,813 --> 00:55:40,475
<i>They used a chisel to shatter the cylinder.</i>

800
00:55:40,582 --> 00:55:42,572
No, I wasn't aware of that.

801
00:55:42,650 --> 00:55:44,642
<i>I am Jack's cold sweat.</i>

802
00:55:44,753 --> 00:55:47,017
Does this sound strange to you?

803
00:55:47,089 --> 00:55:49,956
<i>Yes, sir, strange. Very strange.</i>

804
00:55:50,025 --> 00:55:52,050
<i>- The dynamite
- Dynamite?</i>

805
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:55,254
left a residue
of ammonium oxalate potassium perchloride.

806
00:55:55,397 --> 00:55:58,834
<i>- Do you know what this means?
- No, what does it mean?</i>

807
00:55:58,901 --> 00:56:00,835
It means it was home-made.

808
00:56:00,903 --> 00:56:05,169
I'm sorry. This is just coming
as quite a shock to me, sir.

809
00:56:05,241 --> 00:56:10,804
Whoever set this dynamite could have blown
out your pilot light days before the explosion.

810
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:13,974
<i>- The gas was just a detonator.
- Who would go and do that?</i>

811
00:56:14,050 --> 00:56:16,109
<i>- I'll ask the questions.
- Tell him.</i>

812
00:56:16,252 --> 00:56:20,656
Tell him the liberator who destroyed
my property realigned my perceptions.

813
00:56:20,724 --> 00:56:22,817
<i>Excuse me. Are you there?</i>

814
00:56:22,893 --> 00:56:25,827
I am listening.
It's hard to know what to make of this.

815
00:56:25,895 --> 00:56:30,390
Have you recently made enemies who might
have access to home-made dynamite?

816
00:56:30,467 --> 00:56:32,731
- Enemies?
- Reject civilization,

817
00:56:32,836 --> 00:56:34,896
especially material possessions.

818
00:56:35,006 --> 00:56:37,872
<i>- Son, this is serious.
- Yes, I know it's serious.</i>

819
00:56:37,941 --> 00:56:40,535
<i>- I mean that.
- Yes, it's very serious.</i>

820
00:56:40,644 --> 00:56:43,478
Look, nobody takes this
more seriously than me.

821
00:56:43,548 --> 00:56:46,278
That condo was my life. OK?

822
00:56:46,418 --> 00:56:49,910
I loved every stick of furniture in that place.

823
00:56:50,021 --> 00:56:53,047
<i>That was not just a bunch of stuff
that got destroyed.</i>

824
00:56:53,124 --> 00:56:56,025
<i>- It was me!
- I'd like to thank the Academy.</i>

825
00:56:56,094 --> 00:57:00,121
<i>- Is this not a good time for you?
- Just tell him you fucking did it!</i>

826
00:57:00,231 --> 00:57:04,100
Tell him you blew it all up!
That's what he wants to hear.

827
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:09,072
<i>- Are you still there?
- Wait. Are you saying that I'm a suspect?</i>

828
00:57:09,140 --> 00:57:13,134
No. I may need to talk to you, so you
let me know if you're gonna leave town.

829
00:57:13,245 --> 00:57:15,645
<i>- OK?
- OK.</i>

830
00:57:18,318 --> 00:57:22,947
<i>Except for their humping,
Tyler and Marla were never in the same room.</i>

831
00:57:23,055 --> 00:57:26,116
<i>My parents pulled this exact same act
for years.</i>

832
00:57:26,193 --> 00:57:29,959
The condom is the glass slipper
of our generation.

833
00:57:30,063 --> 00:57:32,964
You slip one on when you meet a stranger.

834
00:57:33,066 --> 00:57:35,125
You... dance all night.

835
00:57:35,202 --> 00:57:37,295
Then you throw it away.

836
00:57:37,537 --> 00:57:40,165
The condom, I mean. Not the stranger.

837
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:43,175
What?

838
00:57:48,015 --> 00:57:50,813
I got this dress at a thrift store for $1.

839
00:57:50,918 --> 00:57:52,782
It was worth every penny.

840
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:54,946
It's a bridesmaid's dress.

841
00:57:55,923 --> 00:57:59,120
Someone loved it intensely

842
00:57:59,193 --> 00:58:01,218
for one day.

843
00:58:01,329 --> 00:58:03,422
Then tossed it.

844
00:58:05,299 --> 00:58:07,358
Like a Christmas tree.

845
00:58:07,502 --> 00:58:09,595
So special.

846
00:58:09,705 --> 00:58:11,138
Then

847
00:58:11,206 --> 00:58:13,003
bam!

848
00:58:13,108 --> 00:58:15,166
It's on the side of the road.

849
00:58:15,743 --> 00:58:17,837
Tinsel still clinging to it.

850
00:58:19,915 --> 00:58:21,974
Like a sex crime victim.

851
00:58:22,050 --> 00:58:24,143
Underwear inside out.

852
00:58:24,821 --> 00:58:28,654
- Bound with electrical tape.
- Well then, it suits you.

853
00:58:28,757 --> 00:58:31,453
You can borrow it sometime.

854
00:58:38,467 --> 00:58:40,561
Get rid of her.

855
00:58:41,337 --> 00:58:44,238
<i>- What? You get rid of her!
- Don't mention me.</i>

856
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:48,538
<i>I am six years old again,
passing messages between parents.</i>

857
00:58:50,547 --> 00:58:54,143
- I really think it's time you left.
- Don't worry, I'm leaving.

858
00:58:54,218 --> 00:58:58,847
- Not that we don't love your visits.
- You are such a nutcase. I can't keep up.

859
00:59:01,024 --> 00:59:03,892
Gotta get off

860
00:59:03,994 --> 00:59:05,256
Thanks. Bye.

861
00:59:05,362 --> 00:59:11,301
Gotta get off of this merry-go-round

862
00:59:12,069 --> 00:59:15,904
Gonna get, need to get...

863
00:59:16,007 --> 00:59:18,032
Gotta get...

864
00:59:20,244 --> 00:59:21,677
You kids!

865
00:59:23,682 --> 00:59:26,173
Why do you still waste time with her?

866
00:59:26,251 --> 00:59:28,583
I'll say this about Marla.

867
00:59:28,653 --> 00:59:30,918
<i>At least she's trying to hit bottom.</i>

868
00:59:31,023 --> 00:59:32,319
And I'm not?

869
00:59:32,424 --> 00:59:35,257
Feathers up your butt
do not make you a chicken.

870
00:59:35,327 --> 00:59:37,420
What are we doing tonight?

871
00:59:38,097 --> 00:59:40,327
Tonight... we make soap.

872
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:42,425
Really?

873
00:59:42,534 --> 00:59:45,368
To make soap, first we render fat.

874
01:00:04,257 --> 01:00:06,487
The salt balance has to be just right

875
01:00:06,626 --> 01:00:09,118
so the best fat for soap comes from humans.

876
01:00:09,930 --> 01:00:13,024
- Wait, what is this place?
- A liposuction clinic.

877
01:00:21,108 --> 01:00:23,134
Pay dirt!

878
01:00:23,244 --> 01:00:27,077
Richest, creamiest fat in the world.
Fat of the land!

879
01:00:32,687 --> 01:00:36,248
No! Don't pull it, don't pull it!

880
01:00:40,862 --> 01:00:43,126
- Oh, God!
- Give me another one.

881
01:00:49,270 --> 01:00:52,729
As the fat renders,
the tallows float to the surface.

882
01:00:52,808 --> 01:00:54,901
Like in Boy Scouts.

883
01:00:54,977 --> 01:00:58,778
- It's hard to imagine you as a Boy Scout.
- Keep stirring.

884
01:01:01,116 --> 01:01:04,677
Once the tallow hardens,
you skim off a layer of glycerin.

885
01:01:04,753 --> 01:01:07,154
Add nitric acid, you've got nitroglycerin.

886
01:01:07,223 --> 01:01:11,090
Then add sodium nitrate and sawdust,
you've got dynamite.

887
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:14,995
Yeah, with enough soap,
one could blow up just about anything.

888
01:01:15,098 --> 01:01:17,157
<i>Tyler was full of useful information.</i>

889
01:01:17,233 --> 01:01:21,192
People found clothes got cleaner
when washed at a certain point in the river.

890
01:01:21,304 --> 01:01:23,329
- You know why?
- No.

891
01:01:26,176 --> 01:01:29,977
Human sacrifices were once made
on the hills above this river.

892
01:01:30,047 --> 01:01:33,243
Bodies burnt.
Water permeated the ashes to create lye.

893
01:01:33,350 --> 01:01:35,785
This is lye. The crucial ingredient.

894
01:01:35,853 --> 01:01:40,654
Once it mixed with the melted body fat,
a white soapy discharge crept into the river.

895
01:01:40,758 --> 01:01:42,817
May I see your hand, please?

896
01:01:48,199 --> 01:01:51,431
What is this?

897
01:01:51,536 --> 01:01:54,129
This is a chemical burn.

898
01:01:54,205 --> 01:01:57,733
It will hurt more than any burn
and it will leave a scar.

899
01:01:57,809 --> 01:02:00,437
<i>Meditation worked for cancer,
it could work now.</i>

900
01:02:01,246 --> 01:02:04,010
- Don't shut the pain out.
- Oh, God!

901
01:02:04,816 --> 01:02:09,253
The first soap was made from heroes' ashes,
like the first monkey shot into space.

902
01:02:09,354 --> 01:02:12,347
Without pain or sacrifice,
we would have nothing.

903
01:02:12,425 --> 01:02:15,360
<i>I tried not to think
of the word searing of flesh.</i>

904
01:02:15,428 --> 01:02:18,590
Stop it!
This is your pain, this is your burning hand.

905
01:02:18,697 --> 01:02:21,360
I'm going to my cave
to find my power animal.

906
01:02:21,434 --> 01:02:25,461
No! Don't deal with this
the way those dead people do! Come on!

907
01:02:25,571 --> 01:02:29,564
- I get the point!
- No! You're feeling premature enlightenment.

908
01:02:32,378 --> 01:02:36,440
It's the greatest moment of your life,
and you're off somewhere else!

909
01:02:36,517 --> 01:02:38,040
I am not!

910
01:02:38,117 --> 01:02:41,109
Shut up!
Our fathers were our models for God.

911
01:02:41,220 --> 01:02:44,384
If our fathers bailed,
what does that tell you about God?

912
01:02:45,392 --> 01:02:50,625
Listen to me. You have to consider
the possibility that God does not like you.

913
01:02:50,731 --> 01:02:54,827
He never wanted you.
In all probability, He hates you.

914
01:02:54,902 --> 01:02:58,464
This is not the worst thing that can happen.
We don't need Him!

915
01:02:58,540 --> 01:03:01,508
- I agree!
- Fuck damnation, fuck redemption.

916
01:03:01,608 --> 01:03:04,100
We are God's unwanted children? So be it!

917
01:03:04,212 --> 01:03:08,706
- I'm getting water!
- You can use water and make it worse or...

918
01:03:09,851 --> 01:03:13,343
- Or use vinegar to neutralize the burn.
- Please let me up!

919
01:03:13,455 --> 01:03:15,514
First, you have to give up.

920
01:03:15,623 --> 01:03:18,320
First, you have to know, not fear,

921
01:03:18,427 --> 01:03:21,419
know that some day, you're gonna die.

922
01:03:21,497 --> 01:03:23,726
You don't know how this feels!

923
01:03:27,670 --> 01:03:31,970
It's only after we've lost everything
that we're free to do anything.

924
01:03:33,976 --> 01:03:36,069
OK.

925
01:03:49,326 --> 01:03:51,351
Congratulations.

926
01:03:51,461 --> 01:03:54,362
You're one step closer to hitting the bottom.

927
01:03:57,400 --> 01:04:00,460
<i>Tyler sold his soap
to department stores at $20 a bar.</i>

928
01:04:00,537 --> 01:04:02,529
<i>God knows what they charged.</i>

929
01:04:02,607 --> 01:04:05,871
- This is the best soap.
- Why, thank you, Susan.

930
01:04:05,942 --> 01:04:08,001
<i>It was beautiful.</i>

931
01:04:08,111 --> 01:04:11,980
<i>We were selling rich women
their own fat asses back to them.</i>

932
01:04:12,984 --> 01:04:15,077
<i>He was wearing his yellow tie.</i>

933
01:04:15,153 --> 01:04:17,417
<i>I didn't wear a tie to work any more.</i>

934
01:04:17,522 --> 01:04:21,151
"The first rule of Fight Club
is don't talk about Fight Club."

935
01:04:21,225 --> 01:04:24,787
<i>I'm half-asleep again.
I must have left it in the copy machine.</i>

936
01:04:24,897 --> 01:04:27,364
"The second rule..." Is this yours?

937
01:04:29,233 --> 01:04:32,795
Pretend you're me.
Make a managerial decision.

938
01:04:32,905 --> 01:04:35,339
You find this. What would you do?

939
01:04:39,978 --> 01:04:41,969
Well, I gotta tell you,

940
01:04:42,047 --> 01:04:45,710
I'd be very, very careful
who you talk to about that.

941
01:04:45,817 --> 01:04:49,117
Because the person who wrote that
is dangerous.

942
01:04:49,189 --> 01:04:53,649
And this button-down, Oxford-cloth psycho
might just snap

943
01:04:53,793 --> 01:04:56,626
and then stalk from office to office

944
01:04:56,729 --> 01:05:01,792
with an Armalite AR10 carbine gas-powered
semiautomatic weapon,

945
01:05:01,868 --> 01:05:06,328
pumping round after round
into colleagues and co-workers.

946
01:05:07,006 --> 01:05:10,374
This might be someone
you've known for years.

947
01:05:10,444 --> 01:05:13,571
Someone very, very close to you.

948
01:05:13,646 --> 01:05:17,048
<i>Tyler's words coming out of my mouth.</i>

949
01:05:18,052 --> 01:05:20,145
<i>And I used to be such a nice guy.</i>

950
01:05:20,221 --> 01:05:23,554
Or maybe you shouldn't bring me
every piece of trash you pick up.

951
01:05:27,394 --> 01:05:31,058
- Compliance and Liability.
- My tit's gonna rot off.

952
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,559
Will you excuse me? I need to take this.

953
01:05:40,842 --> 01:05:44,470
- What do you mean?
- I need you to check for a lump in my breast.

954
01:05:44,578 --> 01:05:48,515
- Go to a hospital.
- I can't afford to waste money on a doctor.

955
01:05:49,484 --> 01:05:51,679
I don't know about this, Marla.

956
01:05:51,786 --> 01:05:53,482
Please.

957
01:05:53,589 --> 01:05:57,581
<i>She didn't call Tyler. I'm neutral in her book.</i>

958
01:05:59,628 --> 01:06:03,656
That's nice.
Taking food to Mrs Haniver and Mrs Raines.

959
01:06:03,733 --> 01:06:05,860
Where are they, exactly?

960
01:06:05,935 --> 01:06:10,065
Tragically, they're dead.
I'm alive and I'm in poverty. Want any?

961
01:06:10,139 --> 01:06:12,232
- No, no.
- I got one for you.

962
01:06:12,308 --> 01:06:14,401
Thanks for the thought.

963
01:06:15,746 --> 01:06:18,077
What happened to your hand?

964
01:06:18,147 --> 01:06:20,308
Oh, nothing.

965
01:06:20,416 --> 01:06:22,476
Right there?

966
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:26,216
- Feel anything?
- No.

967
01:06:26,323 --> 01:06:28,313
Well, make sure.

968
01:06:28,424 --> 01:06:30,450
OK, I'm pretty sure.

969
01:06:30,527 --> 01:06:32,518
You feel nothing?

970
01:06:32,629 --> 01:06:34,927
No, nothing.

971
01:06:36,466 --> 01:06:39,299
Well, that's a relief. Thank you.

972
01:06:40,904 --> 01:06:44,102
- No problem.
- I wish I could return the favor.

973
01:06:44,175 --> 01:06:46,268
Breast cancer doesn't run in my family.

974
01:06:46,344 --> 01:06:49,836
- I could check your prostate.
- I think I'm OK.

975
01:06:49,947 --> 01:06:52,040
Well, thanks, anyway.

976
01:06:57,055 --> 01:06:59,354
- Are we done?
- Yeah, we're done.

977
01:06:59,458 --> 01:07:01,652
See you... around.

978
01:07:18,869 --> 01:07:20,997
Cornelius?

979
01:07:21,072 --> 01:07:23,437
Cornelius!

980
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:26,236
It's me! Bob!

981
01:07:26,343 --> 01:07:27,776
Hey, Bob.

982
01:07:31,349 --> 01:07:34,340
- We all thought you were dead.
- No, no. Still here.

983
01:07:34,418 --> 01:07:38,446
- How are you, Bob?
- Better than I've ever been in my whole life.

984
01:07:38,556 --> 01:07:42,048
- Really? Still remaining men together?
- No, no.

985
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:45,891
- I got something so much better now.
- Really, what is it?

986
01:07:46,564 --> 01:07:48,429
Well...

987
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:52,767
The first rule is,
I'm not supposed to talk about it.

988
01:07:52,872 --> 01:07:54,999
And the second rule is

989
01:07:55,074 --> 01:07:57,372
I'm not supposed to talk about it.

990
01:07:57,443 --> 01:08:00,879
- And the third rule is...
- Bob, Bob. I'm a member.

991
01:08:01,013 --> 01:08:03,072
Look at my face, Bob.

992
01:08:05,485 --> 01:08:07,816
That's fucking... fucking great.

993
01:08:07,887 --> 01:08:11,618
- I've never seen you there.
- I go Tuesdays and Thursdays.

994
01:08:11,691 --> 01:08:15,423
- I go Saturday.
- Congratulations.

995
01:08:15,829 --> 01:08:18,194
Yeah, hey, to both of us, right?

996
01:08:18,264 --> 01:08:20,893
Have you heard about the guy
that invented it?

997
01:08:21,034 --> 01:08:23,901
- Yeah, actually...
- I hear all kinds of things.

998
01:08:24,037 --> 01:08:27,633
Supposedly,
he was born in a mental institution

999
01:08:27,709 --> 01:08:31,109
and he sleeps only one hour a night.

1000
01:08:31,211 --> 01:08:33,406
He's a great man.

1001
01:08:34,882 --> 01:08:37,214
Do you know about Tyler Durden?

1002
01:09:02,176 --> 01:09:04,270
I didn't hurt you, did I?

1003
01:09:04,346 --> 01:09:06,439
Actually, you did.

1004
01:09:06,515 --> 01:09:08,574
Thank you for this.

1005
01:09:08,851 --> 01:09:11,252
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1006
01:09:11,321 --> 01:09:13,379
<i>Fight Club.</i>

1007
01:09:13,489 --> 01:09:15,582
<i>This was mine and Tyler's gift.</i>

1008
01:09:15,791 --> 01:09:17,759
<i>Our gift to the world.</i>

1009
01:09:17,860 --> 01:09:21,194
I look around, I look around,
I see a lot of new faces.

1010
01:09:22,799 --> 01:09:24,993
Shut up!

1011
01:09:25,134 --> 01:09:29,970
Which means a lot of people have been
breaking the first two rules of Fight Club.

1012
01:09:38,314 --> 01:09:42,376
I see in Fight Club the strongest
and smartest men who've ever lived.

1013
01:09:42,486 --> 01:09:44,545
I see all this potential.

1014
01:09:44,622 --> 01:09:46,714
And I see it squandered.

1015
01:09:47,725 --> 01:09:50,819
Goddamn it,
an entire generation pumping gas.

1016
01:09:51,395 --> 01:09:53,488
Waiting tables.

1017
01:09:53,564 --> 01:09:55,624
Slaves with white collars.

1018
01:09:58,135 --> 01:10:01,195
Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes.

1019
01:10:01,305 --> 01:10:04,571
Working jobs we hate
so we can buy shit we don't need.

1020
01:10:08,445 --> 01:10:10,914
We're the middle children of history.

1021
01:10:10,982 --> 01:10:13,041
No purpose or place.

1022
01:10:13,251 --> 01:10:15,344
We have no Great War.

1023
01:10:15,654 --> 01:10:17,748
No Great Depression.

1024
01:10:19,524 --> 01:10:21,856
Our great war is a spiritual war.

1025
01:10:22,327 --> 01:10:25,661
Our great depression is our lives.

1026
01:10:28,534 --> 01:10:31,594
We've all been raised
on television to believe

1027
01:10:31,671 --> 01:10:35,368
that one day we'd be millionaires
and movie gods and rock stars.

1028
01:10:35,441 --> 01:10:37,534
But we won't.

1029
01:10:37,610 --> 01:10:40,045
We're slowly learning that fact.

1030
01:10:40,180 --> 01:10:42,613
And we're very, very pissed off.

1031
01:10:42,682 --> 01:10:44,343
Yeah!

1032
01:10:47,254 --> 01:10:51,690
- First rule of Fight Club is, do not talk...

1033
01:10:57,197 --> 01:10:58,459
Who are you?

1034
01:10:59,299 --> 01:11:01,894
- Who am I?
- Yeah.

1035
01:11:02,803 --> 01:11:05,636
There's a sign on the front
that says Lou's Tavern.

1036
01:11:06,707 --> 01:11:10,610
I'm fucking Lou. Who the fuck are you?

1037
01:11:10,678 --> 01:11:12,771
Tyler Durden.

1038
01:11:15,884 --> 01:11:19,376
Who told you motherfuckers
that you could use my place?

1039
01:11:19,454 --> 01:11:21,820
We have a deal worked out with Irvine.

1040
01:11:21,890 --> 01:11:24,484
Irvine's at home with a broken collarbone.

1041
01:11:24,592 --> 01:11:26,719
He don't own this place. I do.

1042
01:11:28,897 --> 01:11:32,390
- How much money's he getting for this?
- There is no money.

1043
01:11:32,468 --> 01:11:35,265
- Free to all.
- Ain't that something?

1044
01:11:35,336 --> 01:11:37,201
It is, actually.

1045
01:11:37,272 --> 01:11:39,707
Look, stupid fuck!

1046
01:11:39,808 --> 01:11:42,333
- I want everybody out of here right now.
- Hey!

1047
01:11:42,444 --> 01:11:44,674
You should join our club.

1048
01:11:45,048 --> 01:11:47,038
Did you hear what I just said?

1049
01:11:47,116 --> 01:11:49,243
You and your friend.

1050
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:53,248
You hear me now?

1051
01:11:55,458 --> 01:11:57,516
No, I didn't quite catch that, Lou.

1052
01:12:03,667 --> 01:12:05,658
Still not getting it.

1053
01:12:06,703 --> 01:12:08,864
OK, OK, I got it.

1054
01:12:08,939 --> 01:12:11,430
I got it, I got it. Shit, I lost it.

1055
01:12:12,475 --> 01:12:14,340
Back! All of you!

1056
01:12:16,047 --> 01:12:18,106
Everybody back!

1057
01:12:25,589 --> 01:12:27,750
Ah, Lou!

1058
01:12:27,858 --> 01:12:31,521
Come on, man!
We really like this place.

1059
01:12:40,572 --> 01:12:43,506
- That's right, Lou. Get it out.
- Shut the fuck up.

1060
01:12:43,607 --> 01:12:45,405
Oh, yeah!

1061
01:12:50,382 --> 01:12:52,475
Is that fucking funny?

1062
01:13:02,028 --> 01:13:04,621
Fucking guy is a loony, I'm telling you.

1063
01:13:05,497 --> 01:13:07,159
Unbelievable.

1064
01:13:11,404 --> 01:13:14,373
- You don't know where I've been, Lou.
- Oh, my God!

1065
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:17,341
You don't know where I've been!

1066
01:13:20,413 --> 01:13:23,508
Please let us keep it, Lou! Please, Lou!

1067
01:13:23,584 --> 01:13:26,017
Fucking use the basement! Christ!

1068
01:13:26,119 --> 01:13:28,987
I want your word, Lou! I want your word!

1069
01:13:29,056 --> 01:13:31,047
On my mother's eyes.

1070
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:42,327
Thanks, Lou.

1071
01:13:43,638 --> 01:13:45,731
You too, big guy.

1072
01:13:49,676 --> 01:13:51,770
We'll see you next week.

1073
01:14:07,263 --> 01:14:10,857
This week, each one of you
has a homework assignment.

1074
01:14:10,965 --> 01:14:15,801
You're gonna go out. You're gonna
start a fight with a total stranger.

1075
01:14:19,041 --> 01:14:21,202
You're gonna start a fight

1076
01:14:21,310 --> 01:14:23,403
and you're gonna lose.

1077
01:14:25,381 --> 01:14:27,316
Excellent choice, sir.

1078
01:14:29,886 --> 01:14:33,184
Hey! Watch out, jackass! Come on!

1079
01:14:33,589 --> 01:14:36,218
<i>Now, this is not as easy as it sounds.</i>

1080
01:14:38,929 --> 01:14:40,897
Son of a bitch!

1081
01:14:40,997 --> 01:14:45,730
<i>Most people, normal people,
do just about anything to avoid a fight.</i>

1082
01:14:46,670 --> 01:14:48,730
Excuse me!

1083
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:52,537
You sprayed me with your hose.
That's not necessary...

1084
01:14:52,643 --> 01:14:54,542
Jay! Go call 911!

1085
01:14:57,281 --> 01:14:59,340
Put the hose down.

1086
01:14:59,450 --> 01:15:01,509
Stop it! Stop it!

1087
01:15:03,154 --> 01:15:05,054
Sorry.

1088
01:15:20,572 --> 01:15:23,040
We need to talk.

1089
01:15:25,277 --> 01:15:27,370
OK.

1090
01:15:27,479 --> 01:15:29,538
Where to begin?

1091
01:15:29,648 --> 01:15:31,843
With your constant absenteeism?

1092
01:15:31,917 --> 01:15:34,478
With your unpresentable appearance?

1093
01:15:34,554 --> 01:15:36,579
You're up for review.

1094
01:15:36,688 --> 01:15:39,885
I am Jack's complete lack of surprise.

1095
01:15:39,958 --> 01:15:41,893
- What?
- Let's pretend.

1096
01:15:41,961 --> 01:15:44,862
You're the Department of Transportation,
OK?

1097
01:15:44,931 --> 01:15:48,594
Someone informs you that this company

1098
01:15:48,701 --> 01:15:52,762
installs front-seat mounting brackets
that failed collision tests,

1099
01:15:52,872 --> 01:15:56,274
brake linings that fail after 1,000 miles,

1100
01:15:56,343 --> 01:16:00,779
and fuel injectors
that explode and burn people alive.

1101
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:02,746
What then?

1102
01:16:02,816 --> 01:16:05,114
Are you threatening me?

1103
01:16:05,186 --> 01:16:07,984
- No...
- Get the fuck out of here. You're fired!

1104
01:16:08,088 --> 01:16:12,525
I have a better solution. Keep me
on the payroll as an outside consultant.

1105
01:16:12,593 --> 01:16:14,686
In exchange for my salary,

1106
01:16:14,762 --> 01:16:18,597
my job will be never to tell people
these things that I know.

1107
01:16:18,700 --> 01:16:22,965
I don't even have to come into the office.
I can do this job from home.

1108
01:16:24,239 --> 01:16:28,369
Who... Who the fuck do you think you are,
you crazy little shit?

1109
01:16:33,648 --> 01:16:37,175
<i>- Security!
- I am Jack's smirking revenge.</i>

1110
01:16:46,161 --> 01:16:48,255
What the hell are you doing?

1111
01:16:57,473 --> 01:16:59,566
That hurt.

1112
01:17:01,011 --> 01:17:03,070
Why would you do that?

1113
01:17:03,747 --> 01:17:06,738
Oh, my God! No! Please stop!

1114
01:17:16,093 --> 01:17:18,186
What are you doing?

1115
01:17:19,263 --> 01:17:21,356
Oh, God, no! Please! No!

1116
01:17:21,431 --> 01:17:25,562
<i>For some reason,
I thought of my first fight, with Tyler.</i>

1117
01:17:25,637 --> 01:17:27,228
No!

1118
01:17:51,663 --> 01:17:56,124
<i>Under and behind and inside
everything this man took for granted,</i>

1119
01:17:56,235 --> 01:17:59,693
<i>something horrible had been growing.</i>

1120
01:17:59,805 --> 01:18:00,863
Look.

1121
01:18:00,939 --> 01:18:05,672
Give me the paychecks, like I asked,
and you won't ever see me again.

1122
01:18:05,744 --> 01:18:08,543
<i>Then, at our most excellent
moment together...</i>

1123
01:18:11,617 --> 01:18:14,347
Thank God!
Please don't hit me again.

1124
01:18:14,454 --> 01:18:16,547
<i>Telephone, computer,</i>

1125
01:18:16,656 --> 01:18:21,821
<i>fax machine, 52 weekly paychecks
and 48 airline flight coupons.</i>

1126
01:18:21,895 --> 01:18:24,295
<i>We now had corporate sponsorship.</i>

1127
01:18:24,364 --> 01:18:29,530
<i>This is how Tyler and I were able to have
Fight Club every night of the week.</i>

1128
01:18:32,172 --> 01:18:35,767
<i>Now, the center of Fight Club
became the two men fighting.</i>

1129
01:18:35,875 --> 01:18:39,334
<i>The leader walked through the crowd,
out in the darkness.</i>

1130
01:18:41,115 --> 01:18:45,643
<i>Tyler was now involved in
a lawsuit with the Pressman Hotel</i>

1131
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:47,984
<i>over the urine content of their soup.</i>

1132
01:18:53,161 --> 01:18:56,152
<i>I am Jack's wasted life.</i>

1133
01:19:03,905 --> 01:19:05,964
Thank you, sir.

1134
01:19:07,476 --> 01:19:10,468
<i>Tyler dreamed up
new homework assignments.</i>

1135
01:19:10,579 --> 01:19:13,104
<i>He handed them out in sealed envelopes.</i>

1136
01:19:52,256 --> 01:19:55,953
- There's a Fight Club up in Delaware City.
- Yeah, I heard.

1137
01:19:57,762 --> 01:19:59,956
There's one in Penns Grove too.

1138
01:20:00,030 --> 01:20:02,260
Bob even found one up in New Castle.

1139
01:20:02,366 --> 01:20:05,427
- Did you start that one?
- No, I thought you did.

1140
01:20:05,537 --> 01:20:08,028
No.

1141
01:20:56,890 --> 01:20:59,085
- Stop for a second.
- Hey, what are we doing?

1142
01:20:59,192 --> 01:21:01,217
- Turn around.
- What are we doing?

1143
01:21:01,294 --> 01:21:03,729
- Homework assignment.
- What kind?

1144
01:21:03,831 --> 01:21:05,855
Human sacrifice.

1145
01:21:05,932 --> 01:21:09,265
- Is that a gun? Please tell me it's not.
- It's a gun.

1146
01:21:09,336 --> 01:21:11,703
- What are you doing?
- Meet me in the back.

1147
01:21:11,806 --> 01:21:14,138
- Don't fuck around!
- Meet me in the back.

1148
01:21:14,242 --> 01:21:16,039
<i>On a long enough time line,</i>

1149
01:21:16,110 --> 01:21:19,011
<i>the survival rate for everyone drops to zero.</i>

1150
01:21:20,014 --> 01:21:22,073
What are you doing? Come on!

1151
01:21:22,149 --> 01:21:25,551
Hands behind your back.
Give me your wallet.

1152
01:21:27,322 --> 01:21:30,620
Raymond K Hessel.
1320 SE Banning, Apartment A.

1153
01:21:31,425 --> 01:21:34,623
- Small, cramped basement apartment?
- How did you know?

1154
01:21:34,730 --> 01:21:37,324
They give shitty apartments letters.

1155
01:21:37,432 --> 01:21:40,526
Raymond! You're going to die.

1156
01:21:40,636 --> 01:21:42,103
No!

1157
01:21:42,170 --> 01:21:46,334
Is that your mom and dad?
They're gonna have to call the kindly doctor.

1158
01:21:46,441 --> 01:21:48,706
Pick up your dental records. Know why?

1159
01:21:48,778 --> 01:21:52,338
- There'll be nothing left of your face.
- Oh, come on!

1160
01:21:52,447 --> 01:21:56,350
An expired community college student ID.
What did you study, Raymond?

1161
01:21:56,452 --> 01:21:59,478
- S... S... Stuff.
- Stuff?

1162
01:21:59,556 --> 01:22:01,648
Were the midterms hard?

1163
01:22:02,792 --> 01:22:05,352
- I asked you what you studied!
- Biology, mostly.

1164
01:22:05,461 --> 01:22:08,953
- Why?
- I don't know.

1165
01:22:09,065 --> 01:22:12,057
What did you wanna be, Raymond K Hessel?!

1166
01:22:13,469 --> 01:22:17,406
The question, Raymond,
was what did you want to be?

1167
01:22:19,109 --> 01:22:21,168
Answer him, Raymond, Jesus!

1168
01:22:21,278 --> 01:22:23,677
- Veterinarian. Veterinarian.
- Animals.

1169
01:22:23,780 --> 01:22:26,750
- Yeah. Animals and stuff.
- Stuff. Yeah, I got that.

1170
01:22:26,817 --> 01:22:29,377
- So you need more schooling.
- Too much school.

1171
01:22:29,486 --> 01:22:31,955
- Would you rather be dead?
- No, please...

1172
01:22:32,023 --> 01:22:36,482
You'd rather die here, on your knees,
in the back of a convenience store?

1173
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:38,187
Please, no.

1174
01:22:42,300 --> 01:22:44,359
I'm keeping your license.

1175
01:22:45,603 --> 01:22:48,596
Gonna check in on you.
I know where you live.

1176
01:22:48,707 --> 01:22:51,699
If you're not working
to be a veterinarian in six weeks,

1177
01:22:51,810 --> 01:22:53,904
you will be dead.

1178
01:22:55,780 --> 01:22:57,839
Now run on home.

1179
01:23:02,588 --> 01:23:04,647
Run, Forrest, run!

1180
01:23:06,325 --> 01:23:08,384
I feel ill.

1181
01:23:09,195 --> 01:23:11,254
Imagine how he feels.

1182
01:23:11,364 --> 01:23:13,423
Come on, this isn't funny!

1183
01:23:13,532 --> 01:23:15,967
What the fuck was the point of that?!

1184
01:23:16,036 --> 01:23:20,165
Tomorrow will be the most beautiful day
of Raymond K Hessel's life.

1185
01:23:20,239 --> 01:23:24,609
His breakfast will taste better
than any meal you and I have ever tasted.

1186
01:23:26,046 --> 01:23:28,139
<i>You had to give it to him.</i>

1187
01:23:28,215 --> 01:23:30,581
<i>- Come on.
- He had a plan.</i>

1188
01:23:30,651 --> 01:23:34,087
<i>And it started to make sense
in a Tyler-sort of way.</i>

1189
01:23:34,187 --> 01:23:36,087
<i>No fear. No distractions.</i>

1190
01:23:36,189 --> 01:23:39,488
<i>The ability to let that which does not matter</i>

1191
01:23:39,593 --> 01:23:41,584
<i>truly slide.</i>

1192
01:23:55,009 --> 01:23:57,102
<i>You are not your job.</i>

1193
01:23:59,047 --> 01:24:02,414
You're not how much money
you have in the bank.

1194
01:24:04,118 --> 01:24:06,211
You're not the car you drive.

1195
01:24:06,721 --> 01:24:09,589
You're not the contents of your wallet.

1196
01:24:09,658 --> 01:24:11,990
You're not your fucking khakis.

1197
01:24:14,830 --> 01:24:18,493
You are the all-singing,
all-dancing crap of the world.

1198
01:24:27,342 --> 01:24:29,538
I'll be out of your way in a sec.

1199
01:24:30,346 --> 01:24:32,439
You don't have to go.

1200
01:24:33,950 --> 01:24:36,042
Whatever.

1201
01:24:37,153 --> 01:24:40,247
No, I mean... It's OK.

1202
01:24:49,766 --> 01:24:51,894
Are you still going to groups?

1203
01:24:52,570 --> 01:24:54,663
Yeah.

1204
01:24:56,139 --> 01:24:58,232
Chloe's dead.

1205
01:24:58,709 --> 01:25:00,700
Wow, Chloe.

1206
01:25:00,778 --> 01:25:02,712
When did that happen?

1207
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:05,145
Do you care?

1208
01:25:05,249 --> 01:25:08,582
I dunno. I haven't thought about it in a while.

1209
01:25:08,886 --> 01:25:10,945
Yeah, well...

1210
01:25:11,055 --> 01:25:13,388
It was the smart move on her part.

1211
01:25:14,760 --> 01:25:16,785
Listen...

1212
01:25:18,095 --> 01:25:20,462
What are you getting out of all this?

1213
01:25:21,166 --> 01:25:23,259
What?

1214
01:25:23,368 --> 01:25:25,700
I mean, all this. Why do you keep...

1215
01:25:26,471 --> 01:25:28,531
Is this making you happy?

1216
01:25:30,142 --> 01:25:32,201
Yeah, well, sometimes.

1217
01:25:33,945 --> 01:25:36,073
I don't know. I don't understand.

1218
01:25:36,149 --> 01:25:39,710
Why does a weaker person
need to latch on to a strong person?

1219
01:25:39,786 --> 01:25:41,912
What is... What is that?

1220
01:25:41,987 --> 01:25:44,149
What do you get out of it?

1221
01:25:45,625 --> 01:25:47,718
No... That's not the same thing at all.

1222
01:25:47,794 --> 01:25:49,922
It's totally different with us.

1223
01:25:49,997 --> 01:25:52,089
Us?

1224
01:25:52,165 --> 01:25:54,099
What do you mean by us?

1225
01:25:54,167 --> 01:25:58,036
- I'm sorry. Do you hear this?
- Hear what?

1226
01:25:58,138 --> 01:26:00,163
- All that noise. Hold on.
- No, wait!

1227
01:26:00,240 --> 01:26:02,969
Don't change the subject!
I want to talk about this.

1228
01:26:03,042 --> 01:26:05,807
- You're not talking about me, are you?
- No.

1229
01:26:05,946 --> 01:26:09,382
- What?
- Playing doctor. What was going on there?

1230
01:26:09,449 --> 01:26:12,715
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing. Nothing.

1231
01:26:12,787 --> 01:26:14,845
- I don't think so.
- What do you want?

1232
01:26:14,988 --> 01:26:17,388
- Look at me.
- No. What?

1233
01:26:18,158 --> 01:26:20,992
- What is that?!
- It's nothing. Don't worry.

1234
01:26:21,062 --> 01:26:23,462
My God. Who did this?

1235
01:26:23,565 --> 01:26:25,623
- A person.
- Guy or girl?

1236
01:26:25,732 --> 01:26:28,531
- What do you care?
- What do you care if I ask?

1237
01:26:28,603 --> 01:26:31,197
- Leave me alone.
- You're afraid to say.

1238
01:26:31,272 --> 01:26:33,263
- I am not. Let me go.
- No! Talk to me.

1239
01:26:33,374 --> 01:26:34,535
Let go of me!

1240
01:26:34,610 --> 01:26:37,339
- This conversation
- This conversation

1241
01:26:37,412 --> 01:26:39,880
- is over.
- is over.

1242
01:26:40,748 --> 01:26:43,843
I just can't win with you, can I?

1243
01:26:53,195 --> 01:26:55,663
Hey, this is getting a little old!

1244
01:26:56,266 --> 01:26:58,597
What is... What is all this?

1245
01:26:58,667 --> 01:27:00,760
What do you think?

1246
01:27:01,704 --> 01:27:03,832
Hey, why do we need bunk beds?

1247
01:27:03,907 --> 01:27:05,772
Hey!

1248
01:27:12,616 --> 01:27:14,447
Too young.

1249
01:27:14,517 --> 01:27:16,178
Sorry.

1250
01:27:16,253 --> 01:27:18,313
What's all that?

1251
01:27:18,422 --> 01:27:21,390
If the applicant is young,
tell him he's too young.

1252
01:27:21,458 --> 01:27:24,086
- Old, too old. Fat, too fat.
- Applicant?

1253
01:27:24,194 --> 01:27:27,528
If the applicant waits three days
without food or shelter,

1254
01:27:27,632 --> 01:27:29,691
he may enter and begin training.

1255
01:27:29,799 --> 01:27:31,630
Training for what?

1256
01:27:37,241 --> 01:27:39,300
You think this is a game?

1257
01:27:39,410 --> 01:27:42,072
You're too young to train here, end of story.

1258
01:27:42,146 --> 01:27:44,876
Quit wasting our time.
Get the fuck out of here.

1259
01:27:48,820 --> 01:27:50,879
Bad news, friend.

1260
01:27:51,156 --> 01:27:53,248
It's not gonna happen.

1261
01:27:53,324 --> 01:27:55,623
Sorry if there was a misunderstanding.

1262
01:27:55,694 --> 01:27:57,628
It's not the end of the world.

1263
01:27:57,696 --> 01:27:59,891
Just... go away.

1264
01:28:00,766 --> 01:28:02,825
Go.

1265
01:28:02,901 --> 01:28:06,564
You're trespassing
and I will have to call the police.

1266
01:28:09,676 --> 01:28:11,735
Don't you look at me!

1267
01:28:11,844 --> 01:28:15,108
You're never getting in this fucking house!

1268
01:28:15,180 --> 01:28:18,548
Never. Now get the fuck off my porch!
Get off my porch!

1269
01:28:18,651 --> 01:28:22,178
<i>Sooner or later,
we all became what Tyler wanted us to be.</i>

1270
01:28:22,288 --> 01:28:25,121
I'm gonna go inside
and I'm gonna get a shovel.

1271
01:28:32,666 --> 01:28:34,861
- Got two black shirts?
- Yes, sir.

1272
01:28:34,935 --> 01:28:37,198
- Two pair of black pants?
- Yes, sir.

1273
01:28:37,303 --> 01:28:40,273
- One pair black boots? Black socks?
- Yes, sir.

1274
01:28:40,341 --> 01:28:42,400
- One blackjacket.
- Yes, sir.

1275
01:28:42,509 --> 01:28:45,501
- $300 personal burial money?
- Yes, sir.

1276
01:28:47,681 --> 01:28:49,740
All right.

1277
01:28:59,560 --> 01:29:01,620
You're too old, fat man.

1278
01:29:01,730 --> 01:29:04,893
Your tits are too big.
Get the fuck off my porch.

1279
01:29:12,707 --> 01:29:14,766
Bob! Bob!

1280
01:29:30,760 --> 01:29:33,422
Like a monkey ready to be shot into space.

1281
01:29:34,196 --> 01:29:35,663
Space monkey.

1282
01:29:35,765 --> 01:29:39,258
Ready to sacrifice himself
for the greater good.

1283
01:29:45,876 --> 01:29:48,572
You are too fucking old, fatty!

1284
01:29:48,645 --> 01:29:51,842
And you... You're too fucking

1285
01:29:51,948 --> 01:29:53,575
blond!

1286
01:29:53,650 --> 01:29:55,982
Get out of here, the both of you!

1287
01:29:56,053 --> 01:29:58,180
<i>And so it went.</i>

1288
01:29:58,355 --> 01:30:00,449
Listen up, maggots.

1289
01:30:00,558 --> 01:30:02,617
You are not special.

1290
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:06,258
You are not a beautiful or unique snowflake.

1291
01:30:06,363 --> 01:30:10,698
You are the same decaying organic matter
as everything else.

1292
01:30:10,802 --> 01:30:12,895
<i>Tyler built himself an army.</i>

1293
01:30:13,171 --> 01:30:16,800
<i>We are the all-singing,
all-dancing crap of the world.</i>

1294
01:30:16,874 --> 01:30:20,503
<i>We are all part of the same compost heap.</i>

1295
01:30:21,579 --> 01:30:24,811
<i>Why was Tyler Durden building an army?</i>

1296
01:30:24,883 --> 01:30:26,975
<i>To what purpose?</i>

1297
01:30:27,051 --> 01:30:29,486
<i>For what greater good?</i>

1298
01:30:32,825 --> 01:30:34,884
<i>In Tyler we trusted.</i>

1299
01:30:40,232 --> 01:30:42,894
When he was like,
"You are not yourjob",

1300
01:30:43,001 --> 01:30:45,061
I was like, "Yeah!"

1301
01:30:46,940 --> 01:30:49,032
Hey, what's all this?

1302
01:30:49,141 --> 01:30:51,235
Hey!

1303
01:30:52,712 --> 01:30:54,407
OK!

1304
01:30:54,481 --> 01:30:56,847
- What's going on?
- We're celebrating.

1305
01:30:56,916 --> 01:30:59,441
- What are we celebrating?
- Go on.

1306
01:31:03,456 --> 01:31:05,617
- Hey.
- Let me get that for you.

1307
01:31:10,230 --> 01:31:13,098
<i>The same great taste, Pepsi.</i>

1308
01:31:15,469 --> 01:31:17,699
Ssh!

1309
01:31:17,771 --> 01:31:21,571
<i>Investigators are here.
The Police Commissioner has arrived.</i>

1310
01:31:21,675 --> 01:31:24,644
<i>Could you tell us
what you think has happened here?</i>

1311
01:31:24,712 --> 01:31:28,945
<i>We believe this is one of many
recent acts of vandalism in the city</i>

1312
01:31:29,050 --> 01:31:32,177
<i>somehow related
to underground boxing clubs.</i>

1313
01:31:32,286 --> 01:31:36,485
<i>We will be coordinating
a rigorous investigation.</i>

1314
01:31:37,392 --> 01:31:41,761
<i>That was Police Commissioner Jacobs
who just arrived on the scene</i>

1315
01:31:41,863 --> 01:31:46,095
<i>- of a four-alarm fire that broke out...
- She's hot.</i>

1316
01:31:46,201 --> 01:31:47,998
<i>Back to you in the studio.</i>

1317
01:31:48,103 --> 01:31:50,504
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1318
01:31:51,474 --> 01:31:53,964
- Holy shit!
- Yeah!

1319
01:32:01,317 --> 01:32:03,342
What the fuck did you guys do?

1320
01:32:03,419 --> 01:32:07,515
<i>Arson investigators
are on the premises...</i>

1321
01:32:11,294 --> 01:32:15,822
Sir, the first rule of Project Mayhem
is you do not ask questions, sir.

1322
01:32:22,039 --> 01:32:24,564
The victory in the war against crime

1323
01:32:24,641 --> 01:32:26,734
will not come overnight.

1324
01:32:26,810 --> 01:32:31,372
It will take dedication and commitment
and, most of all, cooperation.

1325
01:32:31,448 --> 01:32:36,386
Streets are safer now.
There is hope in the inner city. However...

1326
01:32:36,454 --> 01:32:38,444
I gotta take a piss.

1327
01:32:38,555 --> 01:32:41,320
These are the first steps in a long journey.

1328
01:32:41,392 --> 01:32:43,986
That is why we have created Project Hope.

1329
01:32:44,062 --> 01:32:46,155
Bob.

1330
01:32:49,267 --> 01:32:52,031
Project Hope will be ajoint effort

1331
01:32:52,136 --> 01:32:54,866
between the police and community leaders.

1332
01:32:54,973 --> 01:32:59,137
It will be a powerful new weapon
in the war against crime.

1333
01:33:44,591 --> 01:33:48,722
- Wrap it around the top of his Hacky Sack.
- His balls are ice cold.

1334
01:33:50,731 --> 01:33:54,063
Hi. You're gonna call off
your rigorous investigation.

1335
01:33:54,134 --> 01:33:57,502
You will publicly state
there is no underground group or

1336
01:33:57,605 --> 01:33:59,903
these guys are gonna take your balls.

1337
01:34:00,808 --> 01:34:04,609
<i>They'll send one to the New York Times
and one to the LA Times.</i>

1338
01:34:04,680 --> 01:34:06,442
Look.

1339
01:34:06,514 --> 01:34:09,609
The people you are after
are the people you depend on.

1340
01:34:09,685 --> 01:34:13,246
We cook your meals. We haul your trash.
We connect your calls.

1341
01:34:13,355 --> 01:34:17,086
We drive your ambulances.
We guard you while you sleep.

1342
01:34:21,530 --> 01:34:24,329
Do not fuck with us.

1343
01:34:31,741 --> 01:34:33,868
Ball check!

1344
01:34:48,192 --> 01:34:50,284
Bob, you're this way.

1345
01:34:51,394 --> 01:34:53,727
Let's go.

1346
01:34:53,797 --> 01:34:56,994
<i>I am Jack's inflamed sense of rejection.</i>

1347
01:34:58,102 --> 01:35:00,160
Hey!

1348
01:35:14,685 --> 01:35:15,948
Yeah!

1349
01:35:48,721 --> 01:35:51,519
<i>I felt like putting a bullet in every panda</i>

1350
01:35:51,590 --> 01:35:55,458
<i>that wouldn't screw to save its species.</i>

1351
01:35:57,596 --> 01:36:00,361
<i>I wanted to open the dump valves
on oil tankers</i>

1352
01:36:00,467 --> 01:36:03,334
<i>and smother those French beaches
I'd never see.</i>

1353
01:36:06,605 --> 01:36:09,074
<i>I wanted to breathe smoke.</i>

1354
01:36:26,461 --> 01:36:28,587
Where did you go, psycho boy?

1355
01:36:30,298 --> 01:36:33,233
I felt like destroying something beautiful.

1356
01:36:36,772 --> 01:36:38,830
Get him to a fucking hospital.

1357
01:36:38,906 --> 01:36:40,999
Yeah.

1358
01:36:51,787 --> 01:36:54,847
Don't worry, Mr Durden.
Airport parking. Long term.

1359
01:36:56,325 --> 01:36:58,453
After you, Mr Durden.

1360
01:36:59,395 --> 01:37:01,487
After you.

1361
01:37:19,249 --> 01:37:21,844
- Something on your mind, dear?
- No.

1362
01:37:21,919 --> 01:37:25,149
Yeah, why wasn't I told
about Project Mayhem?

1363
01:37:25,255 --> 01:37:28,248
First rule of Project Mayhem
is you do not ask questions.

1364
01:37:28,325 --> 01:37:30,725
Why didn't you include me in the beginning?

1365
01:37:30,828 --> 01:37:36,027
Fight Club was the beginning. Now it's left
the basements and it's Project Mayhem.

1366
01:37:36,100 --> 01:37:40,503
We started Fight Club together. Remember?
It's as much mine as it is yours.

1367
01:37:40,571 --> 01:37:44,837
- Is this about you and me?
- Yeah. Weren't we doing this together?

1368
01:37:44,909 --> 01:37:48,345
This does not belong to us.
We are not special.

1369
01:37:48,445 --> 01:37:50,880
Fuck that. You should have told me.

1370
01:37:51,716 --> 01:37:53,707
Hey, Tyler!

1371
01:37:55,553 --> 01:37:58,045
- Goddamn it, Tyler!
- What do you want?!

1372
01:37:58,123 --> 01:38:00,591
A statement of purpose?
Should I e-mail you?

1373
01:38:00,692 --> 01:38:03,320
- Oh...
- You decide your level of involvement!

1374
01:38:03,395 --> 01:38:06,091
I will! I wanna know certain things first!

1375
01:38:06,164 --> 01:38:08,792
- The first rule of Project Mayhem...
- Shut up!

1376
01:38:10,569 --> 01:38:14,301
- I wanna know what you're thinking.
- Fuck what you know!

1377
01:38:14,373 --> 01:38:17,864
Forget about what you think you know
about life, friendship,

1378
01:38:17,943 --> 01:38:20,003
and especially about you and me.

1379
01:38:21,180 --> 01:38:23,341
What is that supposed to mean?

1380
01:38:26,753 --> 01:38:28,913
What are you doing?

1381
01:38:29,822 --> 01:38:32,552
What do you wish you'd done
before you died?

1382
01:38:32,625 --> 01:38:35,493
- Paint a self-portrait.
- Build a house.

1383
01:38:35,596 --> 01:38:37,962
- And you?
- I don't know. Nothing.

1384
01:38:38,031 --> 01:38:40,430
- Get in the right lane.
- You have to know!

1385
01:38:40,566 --> 01:38:43,593
If you died now,
how would you feel about your life?

1386
01:38:43,704 --> 01:38:47,333
I don't know! Nothing good.
Is that what you want to hear?

1387
01:38:47,407 --> 01:38:49,740
- Come on!
- Not good enough.

1388
01:38:49,811 --> 01:38:52,244
Stop fucking around! Tyler!

1389
01:38:53,513 --> 01:38:55,777
Jesus Christ!

1390
01:38:56,517 --> 01:38:58,610
Goddamn it! Goddamn it! Fuck you!

1391
01:38:58,720 --> 01:39:00,779
Fuck Fight Club. Fuck Marla!

1392
01:39:00,855 --> 01:39:03,517
I am sick of all your shit!

1393
01:39:03,625 --> 01:39:05,525
OK, man.

1394
01:39:07,328 --> 01:39:09,853
- Quit screwing around. Steer!
- Look at you!

1395
01:39:09,964 --> 01:39:12,728
- Steer!
- Look at you. You're fucking pathetic!

1396
01:39:12,800 --> 01:39:17,932
- Why? Why? What are you talking about?
- Why do you think I blew up your condo?

1397
01:39:18,540 --> 01:39:20,064
What?

1398
01:39:20,175 --> 01:39:24,076
Hitting bottom isn't a weekend retreat.
It's not a goddamned seminar.

1399
01:39:24,178 --> 01:39:27,876
Stop trying to control everything
and just let go!

1400
01:39:29,618 --> 01:39:31,449
Let go!

1401
01:39:31,553 --> 01:39:33,647
All right. Fine.

1402
01:39:34,490 --> 01:39:36,424
Fine.

1403
01:40:34,820 --> 01:40:37,288
<i>I'd never been in a car accident.</i>

1404
01:40:37,355 --> 01:40:40,813
<i>This must have been
what all those people felt like</i>

1405
01:40:40,892 --> 01:40:44,089
<i>before I filed them
as statistics in my reports.</i>

1406
01:40:44,162 --> 01:40:46,256
Goddamn!

1407
01:40:49,769 --> 01:40:52,931
We've just had a near-life experience!

1408
01:40:56,776 --> 01:40:58,767
In the world I see,

1409
01:40:58,878 --> 01:41:02,746
you're stalking elk
through the Grand Canyon forests

1410
01:41:02,849 --> 01:41:05,841
around the ruins of Rockefeller Center.

1411
01:41:07,854 --> 01:41:12,189
You'll wear leather clothes
that will last you the rest of your life.

1412
01:41:12,292 --> 01:41:16,854
You'll climb the thick kudzu vines
that wrap the Sears Tower.

1413
01:41:16,930 --> 01:41:21,492
And when you look down,
you'll see tiny figures pounding corn,

1414
01:41:21,568 --> 01:41:25,129
laying strips of venison
in the empty car-pool lane

1415
01:41:25,205 --> 01:41:27,503
of some abandoned superhighway.

1416
01:41:40,955 --> 01:41:43,185
Feel better, champ.

1417
01:42:00,543 --> 01:42:02,340
<i>And then...</i>

1418
01:42:02,411 --> 01:42:03,969
Tyler?

1419
01:42:04,046 --> 01:42:06,139
<i>..Tyler was gone.</i>

1420
01:42:13,522 --> 01:42:15,548
<i>Was I asleep?</i>

1421
01:42:16,626 --> 01:42:18,650
<i>Had I slept?</i>

1422
01:42:18,794 --> 01:42:21,821
You are not a beautiful, unique snowflake...

1423
01:42:21,932 --> 01:42:24,366
<i>The house had become a living thing.</i>

1424
01:42:24,434 --> 01:42:29,065
<i>Wet inside from so many people
sweating and breathing.</i>

1425
01:42:29,573 --> 01:42:32,167
<i>So many people moving, the house moved.</i>

1426
01:42:35,045 --> 01:42:37,139
<i>Planet Tyler.</i>

1427
01:42:37,215 --> 01:42:39,274
<i>I had to hug the walls.</i>

1428
01:42:39,383 --> 01:42:42,476
<i>Trapped inside
this clockwork of space monkeys.</i>

1429
01:42:42,586 --> 01:42:46,387
You shouldn't be smoking in here!
You know how much ether is here!

1430
01:42:46,457 --> 01:42:48,982
<i>Cooking and working and sleeping in teams.</i>

1431
01:42:51,230 --> 01:42:53,288
Hang on a second.

1432
01:43:12,217 --> 01:43:14,913
It's under control, sir.

1433
01:43:17,389 --> 01:43:19,220
Where's Tyler?

1434
01:43:19,291 --> 01:43:22,284
Sir, the first rule of Project Mayhem
is you do not...

1435
01:43:22,395 --> 01:43:24,328
Right... OK.

1436
01:43:26,732 --> 01:43:28,860
<i>I'm all alone.</i>

1437
01:43:29,035 --> 01:43:32,664
<i>My father dumped me. Tyler dumped me.</i>

1438
01:43:32,805 --> 01:43:35,036
<i>I am Jack's broken heart.</i>

1439
01:43:39,245 --> 01:43:43,046
<i>What comes next in Project Mayhem
only Tyler knows.</i>

1440
01:43:43,951 --> 01:43:47,147
<i>The second rule is you do not ask questions.</i>

1441
01:43:49,957 --> 01:43:52,653
Get the fuck away from me!
Get the fuck away!

1442
01:43:53,060 --> 01:43:55,119
Who are all these people?

1443
01:44:00,367 --> 01:44:02,665
The Paper Street Soap Company.

1444
01:44:04,238 --> 01:44:06,298
Can I come in?

1445
01:44:09,443 --> 01:44:11,502
He's not here.

1446
01:44:11,578 --> 01:44:13,843
What?

1447
01:44:14,883 --> 01:44:18,444
Tyler isn't here.

1448
01:44:18,520 --> 01:44:20,579
Tyler went away.

1449
01:44:21,056 --> 01:44:23,115
Tyler's gone.

1450
01:44:40,142 --> 01:44:41,871
Get some help!

1451
01:44:53,022 --> 01:44:57,926
Two gunshot wounds coming through!
Make some fucking room!

1452
01:44:57,995 --> 01:45:00,395
What happened? What happened?

1453
01:45:00,497 --> 01:45:03,364
We were on assignment. We were supposed
to kill two birds with one stone.

1454
01:45:04,634 --> 01:45:06,727
Destroy a piece of corporate art...

1455
01:45:06,803 --> 01:45:09,328
Operation Latte Thunder. Go!

1456
01:45:10,040 --> 01:45:13,204
..and trash a franchise coffee bar.

1457
01:45:19,617 --> 01:45:21,983
We had it all worked out, sir.

1458
01:45:30,161 --> 01:45:33,427
- It went smooth until...
- Police! Freeze!

1459
01:45:33,532 --> 01:45:36,261
- What?
- They shot Bob.

1460
01:45:37,769 --> 01:45:40,204
- They shot him in the head.
- Fucking pigs!

1461
01:45:45,577 --> 01:45:47,602
Oh, God!

1462
01:45:47,679 --> 01:45:50,978
- Those motherfuckers!
- You morons.

1463
01:45:51,050 --> 01:45:55,181
You're running around in ski masks
trying to blow things up?

1464
01:45:55,255 --> 01:45:57,950
What did you think was gonna happen?!

1465
01:45:59,691 --> 01:46:04,061
OK, quick! Get rid of the evidence.
We gotta get rid of this body!

1466
01:46:04,164 --> 01:46:07,031
- Bury him.
- What?

1467
01:46:07,100 --> 01:46:09,364
Take him to the garden and bury him.

1468
01:46:09,436 --> 01:46:12,303
- Come on, people, let's go!
- Get the fuck off!

1469
01:46:12,405 --> 01:46:15,636
Get away from him!
What are you talking about?

1470
01:46:15,708 --> 01:46:18,303
This isn't fucking evidence.
This is a person.

1471
01:46:18,412 --> 01:46:21,608
He's my friend
and you're not burying him in the garden!

1472
01:46:21,681 --> 01:46:24,674
He was killed serving Project Mayhem, sir.

1473
01:46:24,785 --> 01:46:26,810
- This is Bob.
- Sir, in...

1474
01:46:26,887 --> 01:46:29,014
In Project Mayhem, we have no names.

1475
01:46:29,090 --> 01:46:31,080
Now, you listen to me.

1476
01:46:31,191 --> 01:46:35,686
This is a man and he has a name,
and it's Robert Paulsen, OK?

1477
01:46:35,796 --> 01:46:37,696
- Robert Paulsen.
- He's a man

1478
01:46:37,798 --> 01:46:40,632
and he's dead now because of us.
Do you understand that?

1479
01:46:41,303 --> 01:46:43,600
I understand.

1480
01:46:45,840 --> 01:46:49,208
In death, a member of Project Mayhem

1481
01:46:49,277 --> 01:46:51,336
has a name.

1482
01:46:51,480 --> 01:46:54,415
<i>His name is Robert Paulsen.</i>

1483
01:46:54,850 --> 01:46:56,943
His name is Robert Paulsen.

1484
01:46:57,719 --> 01:47:00,415
His name... is Robert Paulsen.

1485
01:47:00,489 --> 01:47:04,323
His name is Robert Paulsen.

1486
01:47:04,426 --> 01:47:07,486
Come on, guys. Please. Stop it.

1487
01:47:07,562 --> 01:47:10,157
His name is Robert Paulsen.

1488
01:47:10,266 --> 01:47:13,326
Shut up! This is all over with!

1489
01:47:16,572 --> 01:47:19,097
Get the fuck out of here.

1490
01:47:47,804 --> 01:47:52,265
- Tyler?
- No, this is Detective Stern of the Arson Unit.

1491
01:47:52,343 --> 01:47:53,901
I need to see you...

1492
01:47:58,416 --> 01:48:02,477
<i>I went to all the cities
on Tyler's used ticket stubs, barhopping.</i>

1493
01:48:02,554 --> 01:48:07,322
<i>I didn't know how or why, but I could look
at 50 different bars, and somehow I just knew.</i>

1494
01:48:07,393 --> 01:48:11,954
<i>I'm looking for Tyler Durden.
It's very important that I talk to him.</i>

1495
01:48:12,096 --> 01:48:13,723
I wish I could help you,

1496
01:48:13,798 --> 01:48:16,131
sir.

1497
01:48:21,406 --> 01:48:23,500
<i>Every city I went to,</i>

1498
01:48:24,543 --> 01:48:26,943
<i>as soon as I set foot off the plane</i>

1499
01:48:27,546 --> 01:48:29,811
<i>I knew a Fight Club was close.</i>

1500
01:48:29,916 --> 01:48:31,576
Hey! Hey!

1501
01:48:32,651 --> 01:48:34,243
Taxi!

1502
01:48:34,353 --> 01:48:36,413
Look at my face. I'm a member.

1503
01:48:36,523 --> 01:48:39,048
Now, I just need to know if you've seen Tyler.

1504
01:48:39,159 --> 01:48:42,821
I'm not exposed to bespeak
any such information to you

1505
01:48:42,928 --> 01:48:47,628
nor would I, even if I had
said information at this juncture,... be able.

1506
01:48:48,335 --> 01:48:51,999
- You're a moron.
- I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

1507
01:48:53,374 --> 01:48:58,402
<i>Tyler had been busy...
setting up franchises all over the country.</i>

1508
01:49:01,182 --> 01:49:05,619
<i>Was I asleep? Had I slept?</i>

1509
01:49:05,686 --> 01:49:07,950
<i>Is Tyler my bad dream, or am I Tyler's?</i>

1510
01:49:09,357 --> 01:49:12,417
- We've just heard the stories.
- What kind of stories?

1511
01:49:12,493 --> 01:49:16,759
- Nobody knows what he looks like.
- He has plastic surgery every three years.

1512
01:49:16,831 --> 01:49:19,857
That's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

1513
01:49:19,967 --> 01:49:24,029
- Is it true about Fight Club in Miami?
- Is Mr Durden building an army?

1514
01:49:24,172 --> 01:49:27,163
<i>I was living in a state of perpetual déjà vu.</i>

1515
01:49:27,976 --> 01:49:30,035
<i>Everywhere I went,</i>

1516
01:49:30,178 --> 01:49:32,112
<i>I felt I'd already been there.</i>

1517
01:49:32,214 --> 01:49:35,116
<i>It was like following an invisible man.</i>

1518
01:49:36,219 --> 01:49:38,277
<i>The smell of dried blood,</i>

1519
01:49:38,387 --> 01:49:41,879
<i>dirty, bare footprints circling each other.</i>

1520
01:49:42,725 --> 01:49:45,922
<i>That aroma of old sweat, like fried chicken.</i>

1521
01:49:46,029 --> 01:49:49,589
<i>The feel of a floor still warm
from a fight the night before.</i>

1522
01:49:50,466 --> 01:49:53,401
<i>I was always just one step behind Tyler.</i>

1523
01:49:56,306 --> 01:49:59,434
His name is Robert Paulsen...

1524
01:50:04,047 --> 01:50:06,141
Welcome back, sir.

1525
01:50:07,117 --> 01:50:09,210
How have you been?

1526
01:50:09,286 --> 01:50:11,446
Do you know me?

1527
01:50:11,521 --> 01:50:13,922
Is this a test, sir?

1528
01:50:14,024 --> 01:50:15,889
No. This is not a test.

1529
01:50:15,959 --> 01:50:18,223
You were in here last Thursday.

1530
01:50:18,762 --> 01:50:21,061
Thursday?

1531
01:50:21,165 --> 01:50:25,124
You were standing where you are now,
asking how good security is.

1532
01:50:25,769 --> 01:50:27,863
It's tight as a drum, sir.

1533
01:50:30,542 --> 01:50:32,702
Who do you think I am?

1534
01:50:32,776 --> 01:50:35,337
Are you sure this isn't a test?

1535
01:50:35,447 --> 01:50:37,347
No, this is not a test.

1536
01:50:37,449 --> 01:50:39,508
You're Mr Durden.

1537
01:50:40,852 --> 01:50:43,514
You're the one who gave me this.

1538
01:50:43,588 --> 01:50:47,786
<i>Please return your seat backs
to their full upright and locked position.</i>

1539
01:50:59,271 --> 01:51:01,330
<i>- Yeah?
- Marla, it's me.</i>

1540
01:51:01,407 --> 01:51:03,376
<i>- Have we ever done it?
- Done what?</i>

1541
01:51:03,477 --> 01:51:04,808
Had sex?

1542
01:51:04,911 --> 01:51:07,071
What kind of stupid question is that?

1543
01:51:07,179 --> 01:51:09,545
Stupid because it's yes
or because it's no?

1544
01:51:09,615 --> 01:51:12,210
<i>- Is this a trick?
- No. I need to know...</i>

1545
01:51:12,319 --> 01:51:16,186
You wanna know if I think
we were just having sex or making love?

1546
01:51:16,288 --> 01:51:19,690
<i>- We did make love?
- Is that what you're calling it?</i>

1547
01:51:19,760 --> 01:51:22,593
Just answer the question!
Did we do it or not?!

1548
01:51:22,696 --> 01:51:25,598
You fuck me, then snub me.
You love me, you hate me.

1549
01:51:25,700 --> 01:51:28,566
You're sensitive,
then you turn into an asshole.

1550
01:51:28,635 --> 01:51:31,331
Does that describe our relationship, Tyler?

1551
01:51:31,405 --> 01:51:33,499
<i>We just lost cabin pressure.</i>

1552
01:51:33,574 --> 01:51:35,041
What did you just say?

1553
01:51:35,143 --> 01:51:37,509
- What is wrong with you?
- Say my name!

1554
01:51:37,578 --> 01:51:41,241
Tyler Durden!
You fucking freak! What's going on?

1555
01:51:41,349 --> 01:51:43,408
- I'm coming over!
- I'm not there!

1556
01:51:43,518 --> 01:51:46,316
You broke your promise.

1557
01:51:46,387 --> 01:51:48,356
Jesus, Tyler.

1558
01:51:48,424 --> 01:51:51,859
- You fucking talked to her about me.
- What the fuck is going on?

1559
01:51:51,959 --> 01:51:55,418
I asked you for one thing. One simple thing.

1560
01:51:55,531 --> 01:51:57,829
Why do people think that I'm you?

1561
01:51:58,400 --> 01:52:00,458
Answer me!

1562
01:52:02,838 --> 01:52:04,669
Sit.

1563
01:52:07,476 --> 01:52:10,173
Answer me. Why do people think I'm you?

1564
01:52:10,280 --> 01:52:12,440
I think you know.

1565
01:52:12,581 --> 01:52:15,141
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

1566
01:52:15,250 --> 01:52:17,981
Why would anyone
possibly confuse you with me?

1567
01:52:18,054 --> 01:52:20,852
I... I don't know.

1568
01:52:25,628 --> 01:52:28,495
- You got it.
- No.

1569
01:52:28,598 --> 01:52:30,691
- Do not fuck with us!
- Say it.

1570
01:52:32,069 --> 01:52:34,093
Because...

1571
01:52:35,472 --> 01:52:36,632
Say it!

1572
01:52:38,308 --> 01:52:40,368
Because we're the same person.

1573
01:52:40,444 --> 01:52:42,571
That's right.

1574
01:52:42,646 --> 01:52:44,806
<i>We are the all-singing, all-dancing crap.</i>

1575
01:52:44,881 --> 01:52:48,613
- I don't understand this.
- You wanted a way to change your life.

1576
01:52:48,686 --> 01:52:50,779
You could not do this on your own.

1577
01:52:50,855 --> 01:52:52,914
All the ways you wish you could be,

1578
01:52:53,023 --> 01:52:54,888
that's me.

1579
01:52:54,992 --> 01:52:58,120
I look like you wanna look,
I fuck like you wanna fuck.

1580
01:52:58,229 --> 01:53:00,595
I am smart, capable and, most importantly,

1581
01:53:00,664 --> 01:53:03,429
I'm free in all the ways that you are not.

1582
01:53:03,502 --> 01:53:04,491
Oh, no.

1583
01:53:04,603 --> 01:53:07,503
- Tyler's not here. Tyler went away.
- What?

1584
01:53:07,605 --> 01:53:09,904
This isn't possible. This is crazy.

1585
01:53:10,008 --> 01:53:12,033
People do it every day.

1586
01:53:12,110 --> 01:53:15,672
They talk to themselves.
They see themselves as they'd like to be.

1587
01:53:15,748 --> 01:53:19,012
They don't have the courage you have
to just run with it.

1588
01:53:22,822 --> 01:53:26,155
You still wrestle with it,
so sometimes you're still you.

1589
01:53:26,292 --> 01:53:30,956
- We should do this again sometime.
- At times, you imagine you're watching me.

1590
01:53:31,063 --> 01:53:33,554
If this is your first time, you have to fight.

1591
01:53:33,666 --> 01:53:38,036
Little by little,
you're just letting yourself become

1592
01:53:38,871 --> 01:53:40,771
Tyler Durden.

1593
01:53:40,873 --> 01:53:43,671
You are not yourjob
or how much money you have!

1594
01:53:43,743 --> 01:53:46,144
- No. You have a house.
- Rented in your name.

1595
01:53:46,246 --> 01:53:49,874
- You have jobs, a life.
- You work nights because you can't sleep.

1596
01:53:49,949 --> 01:53:51,746
Or you stay up and make soap.

1597
01:53:51,851 --> 01:53:56,789
- You're fucking Marla, Tyler.
- Technically, you are. It's all the same to her.

1598
01:53:58,525 --> 01:54:00,551
Oh, my God.

1599
01:54:01,562 --> 01:54:03,655
Now you see our dilemma.

1600
01:54:03,730 --> 01:54:05,994
She knows too much.

1601
01:54:06,099 --> 01:54:11,197
I think we're gonna have to talk about
how this might compromise our goals.

1602
01:54:11,339 --> 01:54:13,465
What... What are you saying?

1603
01:54:14,409 --> 01:54:18,675
This is bullshit. This is bullshit,
I'm not listening to this!

1604
01:54:18,746 --> 01:54:21,408
- You are insane!
- No. You're insane.

1605
01:54:21,517 --> 01:54:24,212
We simply do not have time for this crap.

1606
01:54:25,720 --> 01:54:27,915
<i>It's called a changeover.</i>

1607
01:54:27,989 --> 01:54:30,083
<i>The movie goes on</i>

1608
01:54:30,159 --> 01:54:33,287
<i>and nobody in the audience has any idea.</i>

1609
01:54:46,241 --> 01:54:49,938
- Sir! Are you checking out?
- Yeah. Bill me.

1610
01:54:50,012 --> 01:54:52,447
Can you initial this list of phone calls?

1611
01:54:56,852 --> 01:55:00,914
- When were these made?
- Between 2.00 and 3.30 this morning.

1612
01:55:06,763 --> 01:55:10,859
<i>Have I been going to bed earlier every night?
Have I been sleeping later?</i>

1613
01:55:10,967 --> 01:55:15,837
<i>Have I been Tyler longer and longer?</i>

1614
01:55:18,341 --> 01:55:20,776
Is anybody here?

1615
01:55:23,447 --> 01:55:25,540
<i>Déjà vu all over again.</i>

1616
01:55:27,184 --> 01:55:29,675
With enough soap,
one could blow up anything.

1617
01:55:32,023 --> 01:55:34,082
Oh, my God.

1618
01:55:37,996 --> 01:55:40,361
<i>- 1888.
- Who am I calling?</i>

1619
01:55:40,798 --> 01:55:44,462
<i>1888 Franklin. This is maintenance. Hello?</i>

1620
01:55:45,637 --> 01:55:47,229
<i>Hello?</i>

1621
01:55:47,305 --> 01:55:49,432
1888 Franklin Street?

1622
01:55:49,508 --> 01:55:51,601
<i>Yes. Can I help you?</i>

1623
01:55:54,046 --> 01:55:56,640
<i>- Hello?
- Yeah, yeah.</i>

1624
01:55:56,715 --> 01:55:59,241
I need to talk to your supervisor right away.

1625
01:55:59,318 --> 01:56:01,444
<i>- Speaking.
- OK, listen to me.</i>

1626
01:56:01,520 --> 01:56:04,684
Something terrible
is about to happen to your building.

1627
01:56:04,791 --> 01:56:06,850
<i>It's under control, sir.</i>

1628
01:56:07,293 --> 01:56:10,854
<i>- Excuse me?
- Don't worry about us, sir. We're solid.</i>

1629
01:56:15,101 --> 01:56:16,466
<i>2160.</i>

1630
01:56:24,077 --> 01:56:26,603
Marla! Marla! Hey, wait!

1631
01:56:28,282 --> 01:56:31,080
Wait! I gotta talk to you! Marla! Marla!

1632
01:56:31,151 --> 01:56:35,315
Your bald freaks hit me with a fucking broom!
They almost broke my arm!

1633
01:56:35,456 --> 01:56:38,152
They were burning their fingertips with lye.

1634
01:56:38,258 --> 01:56:42,218
This needs a tremendous act of faith
on your part, but hear me out.

1635
01:56:42,297 --> 01:56:46,255
- Here comes an avalanche of bullshit.
- A little more faith than that.

1636
01:56:49,504 --> 01:56:52,064
I don't wanna hear
anything you have to say.

1637
01:56:52,140 --> 01:56:54,267
You have every right to be...

1638
01:56:54,876 --> 01:56:56,741
I'll just have a coffee, thanks.

1639
01:56:56,845 --> 01:56:59,780
Sir. Anything you order is free of charge, sir.

1640
01:56:59,881 --> 01:57:01,906
Why is it free of charge?

1641
01:57:01,983 --> 01:57:04,043
- Don't ask.
- Whatever.

1642
01:57:04,120 --> 01:57:09,648
I'll have the clam chowder, fried chicken
and baked potato and a chocolate chiffon pie.

1643
01:57:09,724 --> 01:57:11,784
Clean food, please.

1644
01:57:11,894 --> 01:57:14,920
In that case,
may I advise against the clam chowder.

1645
01:57:14,997 --> 01:57:17,090
No clam chowder. Thank you.

1646
01:57:18,567 --> 01:57:20,797
You got about 30 seconds.

1647
01:57:23,506 --> 01:57:25,998
I know I've been acting very strange, OK?

1648
01:57:26,109 --> 01:57:29,544
- I know it seems there's two sides to me...
- Two sides?

1649
01:57:29,612 --> 01:57:34,676
- You're Dr Jekyll and Mr Jackass.
- I know. But I realized something important.

1650
01:57:34,751 --> 01:57:38,812
- What?
- The nature of our relationship wasn't clear

1651
01:57:38,922 --> 01:57:41,288
to me for reasons I won't go into.

1652
01:57:41,358 --> 01:57:43,952
- I know I haven't treated you well.
- Whatever.

1653
01:57:44,027 --> 01:57:46,757
No, no. Fifteen seconds, please!

1654
01:57:46,830 --> 01:57:49,129
Fifteen seconds,
don't open your mouth.

1655
01:57:49,200 --> 01:57:51,292
I'm trying to tell you I'm sorry.

1656
01:57:51,368 --> 01:57:55,703
What I've come to realize
is that I really like you, Marla.

1657
01:57:55,773 --> 01:57:57,900
You do?

1658
01:57:57,975 --> 01:57:59,840
I really do.

1659
01:57:59,944 --> 01:58:04,244
I care about you and I don't want anything
bad to happen to you because of me.

1660
01:58:04,348 --> 01:58:07,112
Marla, your life is in danger.

1661
01:58:07,185 --> 01:58:09,119
What?

1662
01:58:09,187 --> 01:58:12,918
You need to leave town for a while.
Get out of any major city.

1663
01:58:12,990 --> 01:58:15,788
- Just go camping...
- You're an insane person.

1664
01:58:15,860 --> 01:58:19,319
- No. I've involved you in something terrible.
- No. Shut up!

1665
01:58:19,398 --> 01:58:21,958
- You're not safe.
- Shut up!

1666
01:58:23,769 --> 01:58:28,206
- Listen, I tried, Tyler. I really tried.
- I know you did.

1667
01:58:28,273 --> 01:58:31,334
There are things about you I like.
You're smart, funny.

1668
01:58:31,411 --> 01:58:33,379
You're spectacular in bed.

1669
01:58:33,446 --> 01:58:34,878
But

1670
01:58:34,980 --> 01:58:37,039
you're intolerable.

1671
01:58:37,149 --> 01:58:39,641
You have very serious emotional problems.

1672
01:58:39,752 --> 01:58:43,688
Deep-seated problems
for which you should seek professional help.

1673
01:58:43,790 --> 01:58:47,749
- I know, and I'm sorry.
- You're sorry, I'm sorry. Everyone's sorry.

1674
01:58:48,895 --> 01:58:50,988
I can't do this any more.

1675
01:58:51,064 --> 01:58:53,157
I can't.

1676
01:58:53,233 --> 01:58:55,293
And I won't.

1677
01:58:55,402 --> 01:58:57,426
I'm gone.

1678
01:58:57,503 --> 01:59:00,199
You can't leave, Marla! You're not safe!

1679
01:59:03,043 --> 01:59:05,705
- Marla, you don't understand!
- Leave me alone!

1680
01:59:05,813 --> 01:59:08,304
- Marla, I am trying to protect you!
- Let go!

1681
01:59:08,415 --> 01:59:11,407
- I don't ever wanna see you again!
- That's fine...

1682
01:59:11,485 --> 01:59:13,612
Here, wait right here!

1683
01:59:17,492 --> 01:59:20,051
Hold it right there! Shut up!

1684
01:59:20,127 --> 01:59:22,254
Take this money and get on this bus.

1685
01:59:22,329 --> 01:59:24,491
I promise I won't bother you again.

1686
01:59:24,633 --> 01:59:26,066
Shut up!

1687
01:59:26,134 --> 01:59:29,331
Please get on the bus. Please get on the bus.

1688
01:59:30,505 --> 01:59:32,632
Why are you doing this?

1689
01:59:32,707 --> 01:59:36,803
They think you're a threat.
I can't explain it now, just trust me!

1690
01:59:36,878 --> 01:59:41,247
- If I know where you are, you won't be safe.
- I'll keep this, it's asshole tax.

1691
01:59:41,316 --> 01:59:45,720
- Fine. Remember, stay out of major cities.
- Tyler.

1692
01:59:47,256 --> 01:59:50,089
You're the worst thing
that ever happened to me.

1693
02:00:05,107 --> 02:00:07,770
Hello. I need you to arrest me.

1694
02:00:07,878 --> 02:00:10,642
I am the leader of a terrorist organization

1695
02:00:10,714 --> 02:00:15,674
responsible for numerous acts
of vandalism and assault all over this city.

1696
02:00:15,752 --> 02:00:19,654
In the metropolitan area,
we had probably 200 members.

1697
02:00:19,723 --> 02:00:23,524
Chapters have sprung up
in five or six other major cities already.

1698
02:00:23,695 --> 02:00:26,720
This is a tightly-regimented organization

1699
02:00:26,797 --> 02:00:32,395
with many cells capable of operating
independent of central leadership.

1700
02:00:32,503 --> 02:00:36,371
Go to the house, OK? 1537 Paper Street.

1701
02:00:36,474 --> 02:00:38,374
That's our headquarters.

1702
02:00:38,476 --> 02:00:41,070
In the back, buried in the garden,

1703
02:00:41,145 --> 02:00:44,172
you'll find the body of Robert Paulsen.

1704
02:00:44,283 --> 02:00:47,581
In the basement,
you're gonna find some bathtubs

1705
02:00:47,719 --> 02:00:53,022
that have been used very recently
to make large quantities of nitroglycerin.

1706
02:00:53,125 --> 02:00:55,150
I believe the plan is to blow up

1707
02:00:55,227 --> 02:00:58,321
the headquarters
of these credit card companies

1708
02:00:58,397 --> 02:01:00,490
and the TRW building.

1709
02:01:01,433 --> 02:01:04,800
Why these buildings?
Why credit card companies?

1710
02:01:04,903 --> 02:01:08,498
If you erase the debt record,
then we all go back to zero.

1711
02:01:09,341 --> 02:01:11,400
You'll create total chaos.

1712
02:01:13,013 --> 02:01:16,244
Keep him talking. I need to make a phone
call.

1713
02:01:26,826 --> 02:01:29,057
I really admire what you're doing.

1714
02:01:29,530 --> 02:01:31,588
What?

1715
02:01:31,731 --> 02:01:33,756
You're a brave man to order this.

1716
02:01:33,833 --> 02:01:35,597
You're a genius, sir.

1717
02:01:35,736 --> 02:01:40,435
You said if anyone ever interferes
with Project Mayhem, even you,

1718
02:01:40,541 --> 02:01:42,873
we gotta get his balls.

1719
02:01:44,278 --> 02:01:47,441
- Don't fight.
- It's a powerful gesture, Mr Durden.

1720
02:01:47,548 --> 02:01:50,575
- It will set an example.
- You're making a big mistake!

1721
02:01:50,652 --> 02:01:53,484
- You said you'd say that.
- I'm not Tyler Durden!

1722
02:01:53,587 --> 02:01:57,456
- You told us you'd say that too.
- All right. I am Tyler Durden.

1723
02:01:57,559 --> 02:02:00,255
Listen to me. I'm giving you a direct order.

1724
02:02:00,362 --> 02:02:04,492
- We're aborting this mission now.
- You said you would definitely say that.

1725
02:02:10,639 --> 02:02:14,201
Are you fucking out of your minds?
You're police officers!

1726
02:02:15,043 --> 02:02:17,102
Is somebody timing this?

1727
02:02:17,279 --> 02:02:20,249
Keep your mouth shut.

1728
02:02:20,316 --> 02:02:22,409
Shit!

1729
02:02:25,054 --> 02:02:27,852
Some of this information checks out.

1730
02:02:27,924 --> 02:02:31,223
- Let's go to that house on Paper Street.
- Be right there.

1731
02:02:31,928 --> 02:02:33,692
Hey, wait!

1732
02:02:34,398 --> 02:02:36,922
- I got him.
- Sir, we have to do this.

1733
02:02:37,033 --> 02:02:39,501
- Stop fighting!
- Where's the rubber band?

1734
02:02:39,602 --> 02:02:42,094
Get away from me! Drop that fucking knife!

1735
02:02:45,642 --> 02:02:49,078
Back up. Face down on the floor right now!

1736
02:02:50,314 --> 02:02:52,339
Get down on the floor!

1737
02:02:57,122 --> 02:03:00,022
The first person
that comes out of this door

1738
02:03:00,090 --> 02:03:02,058
gets a lead salad! Understand?

1739
02:03:26,385 --> 02:03:28,979
Get away! Stay away!

1740
02:03:41,935 --> 02:03:43,993
<i>I ran.</i>

1741
02:03:44,537 --> 02:03:48,702
<i>I ran until my muscles burned
and my veins pumped battery acid.</i>

1742
02:03:51,344 --> 02:03:53,402
<i>Then I ran some more.</i>

1743
02:04:34,122 --> 02:04:36,420
What the fuck are you doing?

1744
02:04:36,525 --> 02:04:39,460
Running around in your underpants!
You look crazy!

1745
02:04:39,561 --> 02:04:42,655
No. I'm onto you.
I know what's going on here.

1746
02:04:42,764 --> 02:04:47,668
Come on, then. I got us a great place
to watch from. It'll be like pay-per-view.

1747
02:05:35,653 --> 02:05:38,316
- Oh, Christ.
- Now what are you doing?

1748
02:05:38,423 --> 02:05:41,790
- I'm stopping this.
- Why?

1749
02:05:41,860 --> 02:05:45,261
- The greatest thing you've ever done.
- I can't let this happen.

1750
02:05:45,330 --> 02:05:48,595
There are 10 other bombs
in 10 other buildings.

1751
02:05:48,667 --> 02:05:51,033
Since when is Project Mayhem
about murder?

1752
02:05:51,102 --> 02:05:53,094
The buildings are empty.

1753
02:05:53,205 --> 02:05:56,037
We're not killing anyone.
We're setting 'em free!

1754
02:05:56,107 --> 02:05:58,871
Bob is dead. They shot him in the head.

1755
02:05:59,010 --> 02:06:02,344
You wanna make an omelette,
you gotta break some eggs.

1756
02:06:02,448 --> 02:06:06,042
No. I'm not listening to you.
You're not even there.

1757
02:06:12,091 --> 02:06:16,460
I wouldn't do that.
Not unless you knew which wires were what.

1758
02:06:16,529 --> 02:06:18,258
If you know, I know.

1759
02:06:23,870 --> 02:06:28,238
<i>Or maybe I knew you'd know, so I spent
all day thinking about the wrong ones.</i>

1760
02:06:36,751 --> 02:06:37,842
You think?

1761
02:06:39,853 --> 02:06:41,946
Oh, heavens, no. Not the green one.

1762
02:06:42,789 --> 02:06:45,782
Pull any one but the green one.

1763
02:06:50,530 --> 02:06:53,159
I asked you not to do that!

1764
02:06:55,002 --> 02:06:56,560
Fuck!

1765
02:06:57,505 --> 02:06:59,598
Tyler, get away from the van.

1766
02:07:01,809 --> 02:07:05,210
Tyler, I'm not kidding!
Get away from the van!

1767
02:07:05,313 --> 02:07:06,679
Goddamn it!

1768
02:07:13,021 --> 02:07:14,386
OK.

1769
02:07:14,490 --> 02:07:17,823
You are now firing a gun
at your imaginary friend

1770
02:07:17,926 --> 02:07:20,521
near 400 gallons of nitroglycerin!

1771
02:07:22,731 --> 02:07:24,494
Cool it, Tyler!

1772
02:07:37,714 --> 02:07:39,773
Come on!

1773
02:07:39,849 --> 02:07:41,908
Don't go!

1774
02:08:19,491 --> 02:08:20,685
What?!

1775
02:09:06,173 --> 02:09:06,867
Three minutes.

1776
02:09:07,808 --> 02:09:10,106
This is it.

1777
02:09:10,210 --> 02:09:12,235
The beginning.

1778
02:09:12,312 --> 02:09:14,280
Ground zero.

1779
02:09:14,348 --> 02:09:16,646
<i>I think this is about where we came in.</i>

1780
02:09:16,717 --> 02:09:19,209
Do you have a speech for the occasion?

1781
02:09:19,287 --> 02:09:22,312
I'm sorry?

1782
02:09:22,422 --> 02:09:24,481
I still can't think of anything.

1783
02:09:26,528 --> 02:09:28,621
Flashback humor.

1784
02:09:33,701 --> 02:09:35,726
It's getting exciting now.

1785
02:09:37,305 --> 02:09:39,102
Two and a half.

1786
02:09:39,173 --> 02:09:41,734
Think of everything we've accomplished.

1787
02:09:41,844 --> 02:09:46,644
Out these windows, we will view
the collapse of financial history.

1788
02:09:46,714 --> 02:09:50,446
One step closer to economic equilibrium.

1789
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,399
Why is she here?

1790
02:10:06,502 --> 02:10:08,402
Tying up loose ends.

1791
02:10:08,504 --> 02:10:11,565
Put me down, you baldheaded fuck!

1792
02:10:11,675 --> 02:10:14,769
- I beg you, please don't do this.
- I'm not doing this.

1793
02:10:14,878 --> 02:10:18,336
<i>- We are doing this. This is what we want.
- No.</i>

1794
02:10:18,415 --> 02:10:23,148
- I don't want this.
- Right. Except you is meaningless now.

1795
02:10:23,219 --> 02:10:27,213
- We have to forget about you.
- You're a voice in my head.

1796
02:10:27,325 --> 02:10:29,383
You're a voice in mine!

1797
02:10:29,492 --> 02:10:32,326
- Why can't I get rid of you?
- You need me.

1798
02:10:32,396 --> 02:10:34,489
No. I don't. I really don't any more.

1799
02:10:34,565 --> 02:10:38,832
You created me. I didn't create some
loser alter ego to make me feel better.

1800
02:10:38,937 --> 02:10:42,895
- Take some responsibility.
- I do. I am responsible for all of it

1801
02:10:43,007 --> 02:10:44,736
and I accept that.

1802
02:10:44,809 --> 02:10:48,837
So, please, I'm begging you,
please call this off.

1803
02:10:50,848 --> 02:10:53,043
Have I ever let us down?

1804
02:10:54,519 --> 02:10:56,817
How far have you come because of me?!

1805
02:11:02,728 --> 02:11:04,787
I will bring us through this.

1806
02:11:04,863 --> 02:11:08,664
As always, I will carry you
kicking and screaming

1807
02:11:08,768 --> 02:11:11,202
and in the end you will thank me.

1808
02:11:11,671 --> 02:11:14,195
Tyler. Tyler.

1809
02:11:14,272 --> 02:11:17,800
I'm grateful to you.
For everything that you've done for me.

1810
02:11:17,877 --> 02:11:20,573
But this is too much. I don't want this.

1811
02:11:20,647 --> 02:11:25,949
What do you want? Your shitjob back?
Fucking condo world, watching sitcoms?

1812
02:11:26,019 --> 02:11:28,078
Fuck you! I won't do it.

1813
02:11:28,955 --> 02:11:32,790
- This can't be happening.
- It's already done, so shut up!

1814
02:11:32,860 --> 02:11:34,486
60 seconds till CRI.

1815
02:11:35,028 --> 02:11:37,087
No.

1816
02:11:38,999 --> 02:11:41,797
I can figure this out. This isn't even real.

1817
02:11:41,869 --> 02:11:45,566
You're not real, that gun...
That gun isn't even in your hand.

1818
02:11:47,041 --> 02:11:49,100
The gun's in my hand.

1819
02:11:54,115 --> 02:11:56,605
Good for you. It doesn't change a thing.

1820
02:12:05,493 --> 02:12:08,121
Why do you wanna put a gun to your head?

1821
02:12:08,263 --> 02:12:10,322
Not my head, Tyler.

1822
02:12:10,899 --> 02:12:12,924
Our head.

1823
02:12:14,470 --> 02:12:16,529
Interesting.

1824
02:12:19,541 --> 02:12:22,204
Where are you going with this, Ikea boy?

1825
02:12:28,683 --> 02:12:31,676
Hey. It's you and me.

1826
02:12:34,423 --> 02:12:36,483
Friends?

1827
02:12:37,327 --> 02:12:39,420
Tyler,

1828
02:12:42,832 --> 02:12:45,165
I want you to really listen to me.

1829
02:12:45,302 --> 02:12:47,736
OK.

1830
02:12:47,838 --> 02:12:49,897
My eyes are open.

1831
02:13:08,659 --> 02:13:10,684
What's that smell?

1832
02:13:30,315 --> 02:13:33,307
- Where is everybody?
- Oh, no. What's going on?

1833
02:13:33,952 --> 02:13:35,544
Mr Durden!

1834
02:13:36,622 --> 02:13:38,487
Oh, my God!

1835
02:13:43,830 --> 02:13:47,026
Are you... Are you all right, sir?

1836
02:13:47,132 --> 02:13:51,092
- Oh, yeah, I'm OK.
- You look terrible, sir. What happened?

1837
02:13:51,171 --> 02:13:55,164
- Nothing, it's no problem.
- No, no, no, sir. He's not kidding.

1838
02:13:55,241 --> 02:13:58,005
- You look awful. You need assistance.
- I'm fine.

1839
02:13:58,144 --> 02:14:01,739
Look, I'm fine... Everything's fine.

1840
02:14:04,017 --> 02:14:06,248
Stop it!

1841
02:14:06,387 --> 02:14:09,514
- Let her go.
- Christ Almighty!

1842
02:14:09,589 --> 02:14:11,386
You!

1843
02:14:11,457 --> 02:14:13,551
Hi, Marla.

1844
02:14:14,028 --> 02:14:18,862
- Leave her with me. Meet me downstairs.
- Are you sure?

1845
02:14:18,966 --> 02:14:21,025
Yes, I'm sure.

1846
02:14:22,136 --> 02:14:26,232
You fucker! What kind of sick
fucking game are you playing at?!

1847
02:14:26,374 --> 02:14:29,036
Putting me on a... Oh, my God, your face!

1848
02:14:29,144 --> 02:14:30,633
Yeah, I know.

1849
02:14:35,417 --> 02:14:37,282
What happened?

1850
02:14:37,419 --> 02:14:39,546
- Don't ask.
- You're shot.

1851
02:14:39,621 --> 02:14:41,680
- Yes, I'm shot.
- Oh, my God.

1852
02:14:42,624 --> 02:14:45,650
- I can't believe he's standing.
- One tough motherfucker.

1853
02:14:49,465 --> 02:14:51,296
Who did this?

1854
02:14:51,433 --> 02:14:53,901
I did, actually.

1855
02:14:54,002 --> 02:14:56,062
Find some gauze.

1856
02:14:57,440 --> 02:14:59,465
You shot yourself?

1857
02:14:59,575 --> 02:15:02,203
Yes, but it's OK. Marla, look at me.

1858
02:15:02,278 --> 02:15:04,576
I'm really OK.

1859
02:15:04,647 --> 02:15:08,606
Trust me. Everything's gonna be fine.

1860
02:15:21,431 --> 02:15:25,299
You met me at a very strange time in my life.
