1368
01:29:30,156 --> 01:29:33,990
Why, anybody can have a brain.
That's a very mediocre commodity.

Every pusillanimous creature
that crawls on the earth...

1371

Back where I come from,
we have universities...

1372
01:29:43,295 --> 01:29:46,583
seats of great learning,
where men go to become great thinkers.

1373

They think deep thoughts,
and with no more brains than you have.

But they have one thing
you haven't got. A diploma.

1375
01:29:55,307 --> 01:29:59,266
Therefore, by virtue
of the authority vested in me...

That's Doctor of Thinkology.

01:30:13,575 --> 01:30:16,283
The sum of the square roots of
two sides of an isosceles triangle...

1381
01:30:16,536 --> 01:30:19,403
is equal to the square root
of the remaining side.

Oh, joy! Rapture!

- How can I thank you enough?
- Well, you can't.

1385
01:30:27,213 --> 01:30:31,047
As for you, my fine friend,
you're a victim of disorganized thinking.

1386
01:30:31,301 --> 01:30:34,965
You are under the delusion that
because you run away from danger...

1387
01:30:35,221 --> 01:30:39,055
you have no courage.
You're confusing courage with wisdom.

1388

Back where I come from,
we have men who are called "heroes."

1389

Once a year, they take
their fortitude out of mothballs...

And they have no more courage
than you have.

But they have one thing
that you haven't got. A medal.

As for you, my galvanized friend,
you want a heart.

You don't know how lucky you are
not to have one.

1402

Hearts will never be practical
until they can be made unbreakable.

But I still want one.

Back where I come from, there are men

And remember,

1412
01:32:02,100 --> 01:32:05,138
that a heart is not judged
by how much you love...

by others.

1531
01:39:08,109 --> 01:39:09,770
There's no place like home.

1532
01:39:11,154 --> 01:39:13,020
There's no place like home.

1533
01:39:14,782 --> 01:39:16,819
There's no place like home.

1534
01:39:20,746 --> 01:39:22,953
There's no place like home.

1535
01:39:23,749 --> 01:39:25,911
There's no place like home.

1536
01:39:28,045 --> 01:39:31,583
AUNTIE EM: Wake up, honey.
- There's no place like home.

1537
01:39:31,841 --> 01:39:34,333
There's no place like home.

1538
01:39:36,304 --> 01:39:38,090
There's no...

1539
01:39:40,892 --> 01:39:44,351
Dorothy, dear. It's Aunt Em, darling.

1540
01:39:44,604 --> 01:39:46,595
Oh, Auntie Em, it's you!

1541
01:39:46,856 --> 01:39:49,769
- Yes, darling.
PROFESSOR: Hello there! Anybody home?

1542
01:39:50,026 --> 01:39:53,610
I dropped by because I heard
the little girl got caught in the big...

1543
01:39:54,447 --> 01:39:55,812
Well, she seems all right now.

1544
01:39:56,908 --> 01:40:00,276
She got quite a bump on the head.
We kind of thought she was gonna leave us.

1545
01:40:00,536 --> 01:40:03,153
But I did leave you.
That's just the trouble.

1546
01:40:03,414 --> 01:40:05,325
And I tried to get back for days!

1547
01:40:05,583 --> 01:40:07,449
There, there, lie quiet now.

1548
01:40:07,710 --> 01:40:10,702
- You just had a bad dream.
- Sure.

1549
01:40:10,963 --> 01:40:12,453
Remember me...

1550
01:40:12,715 --> 01:40:14,877
your old pal, Hunk?

1551
01:40:15,134 --> 01:40:17,671
And me, Hickory?

1552
01:40:17,929 --> 01:40:19,670
You couldn't forget my face,
could you?

1553
01:40:19,931 --> 01:40:23,595
No. But it wasn't a dream. It was a place.

1554
01:40:23,851 --> 01:40:26,434
And you and you and you...

1555
01:40:26,687 --> 01:40:29,224
- ...and you were there.
- Oh. Ha, ha. Sure.

1556
01:40:29,815 --> 01:40:31,647
But you couldn't have been, could you?

1557
01:40:31,901 --> 01:40:33,901
AUNTIE EM: We dream lots
of silly things when we...

1558
01:40:34,111 --> 01:40:37,979
No, Aunt Em, this was
a real, truly live place.

1559
01:40:38,241 --> 01:40:41,233
And I remember that some of it
wasn't very nice...

1560
01:40:41,494 --> 01:40:43,360
but most of it was beautiful.

1561
01:40:43,621 --> 01:40:47,410
Butjust the same, all I kept saying
to everybody was, "I want to go home!"

1562
01:40:47,667 --> 01:40:49,704
And they sent me home.

1563
01:40:50,086 --> 01:40:51,326
[ALL CHUCKLING]

1564
01:40:51,587 --> 01:40:53,328
Doesn't anybody believe me?

1565
01:40:53,589 --> 01:40:55,580
Of course we believe you, Dorothy.

1566
01:40:55,841 --> 01:40:58,253
But anyway, Toto, we're home!

1567
01:40:58,511 --> 01:41:01,253
Home! And this is my room...

1568
01:41:01,514 --> 01:41:03,004
and you're all here.

1569
01:41:03,266 --> 01:41:06,384
And I'm not going to leave here
ever, ever again...

1570
01:41:06,644 --> 01:41:08,510
because I love you all.

1571
01:41:08,771 --> 01:41:12,139
And 0h, Auntie Em...

1572
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:15,392
there's no place like home!

1573
01:41:20,469 --> 01:41:42,460
