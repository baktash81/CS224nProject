1368
01:29:30,156 --> 01:29:33,990
Why, anybody can have a brain.
That's a very mediocre commodity.

1369

Every pusillanimous creature
that crawls on the earth...

1371
01:29:40,917 --> 01:29:43,033
Back where I come from,
we have universities...

1372
01:29:43,295 --> 01:29:46,583
seats of great learning,
where men go to become great thinkers.

1373
01:29:46,840 --> 01:29:50,879
They think deep thoughts,
and with no more brains than you have.

But they have one thing
you haven't got. A diploma.

1375
01:29:55,307 --> 01:29:59,266
Therefore, by virtue
of the authority vested in me...

by <i>the Universitatus Committeeatum

- ...the honorary degree of Th. D.
- Th. D.?

That's Doctor of Thinkology.

1380
01:30:13,575 --> 01:30:16,283
The sum of the square roots of
two sides of an isosceles triangle...

1381
01:30:16,536 --> 01:30:19,403
is equal to the square root
of the remaining side.

1382

Oh, joy! Rapture!

- How can I thank you enough?
- Well, you can't.

1385
01:30:27,213 --> 01:30:31,047
As for you, my fine friend,
you're a victim of disorganized thinking.

1386
01:30:31,301 --> 01:30:34,965
You are under the delusion that
because you run away from danger...

1387
01:30:35,221 --> 01:30:39,055
you have no courage.
You're confusing courage with wisdom.

1388
01:30:39,309 --> 01:30:43,177
Back where I come from,
we have men who are called "heroes."

1389

Once a year, they take
their fortitude out of mothballs...

1390

And they have no more courage
than you have.

But they have one thing
that you haven't got. A medal.

As for you, my galvanized friend,
you want a heart.

You don't know how lucky you are
not to have one.

1402

Hearts will never be practical
until they can be made unbreakable.

But I still want one.

1404

Back where I come from, there are men

And remember,

1412
01:32:02,100 --> 01:32:05,138
that a heart is not judged
by how much you love...

by others.

1530
01:39:04,188 --> 01:39:07,647
There's no place like home.

1531
01:39:08,109 --> 01:39:09,770
There's no place like home.

1532
01:39:11,154 --> 01:39:13,020
There's no place like home.

1533
01:39:14,782 --> 01:39:16,819
There's no place like home.

1534
01:39:20,746 --> 01:39:22,953
There's no place like home.

1535
01:39:23,749 --> 01:39:25,911
There's no place like home.

1536
01:39:28,045 --> 01:39:31,583
AUNTIE EM: Wake up, honey.
- There's no place like home.

1537
01:39:31,841 --> 01:39:34,333
There's no place like home.

1538
01:39:36,304 --> 01:39:38,090
There's no...

1539
01:39:40,892 --> 01:39:44,351
Dorothy, dear. It's Aunt Em, darling.

1540
01:39:44,604 --> 01:39:46,595
Oh, Auntie Em, it's you!

1541
01:39:46,856 --> 01:39:49,769
- Yes, darling.
PROFESSOR: Hello there! Anybody home?

1542
01:39:50,026 --> 01:39:53,610
I dropped by because I heard
the little girl got caught in the big...

1543
01:39:54,447 --> 01:39:55,812
Well, she seems all right now.

1544
01:39:56,908 --> 01:40:00,276
She got quite a bump on the head.
We kind of thought she was gonna leave us.

1545
01:40:00,536 --> 01:40:03,153
But I did leave you.
That's just the trouble.

1546
01:40:03,414 --> 01:40:05,325
And I tried to get back for days!

1547
01:40:05,583 --> 01:40:07,449
There, there, lie quiet now.

1548
01:40:07,710 --> 01:40:10,702
- You just had a bad dream.
- Sure.

1549
01:40:10,963 --> 01:40:12,453
Remember me...

1550
01:40:12,715 --> 01:40:14,877
your old pal, Hunk?

1551
01:40:15,134 --> 01:40:17,671
And me, Hickory?

1552
01:40:17,929 --> 01:40:19,670
You couldn't forget my face,
could you?

1553
01:40:19,931 --> 01:40:23,595
No. But it wasn't a dream. It was a place.

1554
01:40:23,851 --> 01:40:26,434
And you and you and you...

1555
01:40:26,687 --> 01:40:29,224
- ...and you were there.
- Oh. Ha, ha. Sure.

1556
01:40:29,815 --> 01:40:31,647
But you couldn't have been, could you?

1557
01:40:31,901 --> 01:40:33,901
AUNTIE EM: We dream lots
of silly things when we...

1558
01:40:34,111 --> 01:40:37,979
No, Aunt Em, this was
a real, truly live place.

1559
01:40:38,241 --> 01:40:41,233
And I remember that some of it
wasn't very nice...

1560
01:40:41,494 --> 01:40:43,360
but most of it was beautiful.

1561
01:40:43,621 --> 01:40:47,410
Butjust the same, all I kept saying
to everybody was, "I want to go home!"

1562
01:40:47,667 --> 01:40:49,704
And they sent me home.

1563
01:40:50,086 --> 01:40:51,326
[ALL CHUCKLING]

1564
01:40:51,587 --> 01:40:53,328
Doesn't anybody believe me?

1565
01:40:53,589 --> 01:40:55,580
Of course we believe you, Dorothy.

1566
01:40:55,841 --> 01:40:58,253
But anyway, Toto, we're home!

1567
01:40:58,511 --> 01:41:01,253
Home! And this is my room...

1568
01:41:01,514 --> 01:41:03,004
and you're all here.

1569
01:41:03,266 --> 01:41:06,384
And I'm not going to leave here
ever, ever again...

1570
01:41:06,644 --> 01:41:08,510
because I love you all.

1571
01:41:08,771 --> 01:41:12,139
And 0h, Auntie Em...

1572
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:15,392
there's no place like home!

1573
01:41:20,469 --> 01:41:42,460
