1
00:01:13,773 --> 00:01:17,322
<i>You cannot pass!</i>
<i>Gandalf!</i>

2
00:01:22,013 --> 00:01:27,133
<i>I am a servant of the Secret Flre,</i>
<i>wlelder of the flame of Anor.</i>

3
00:01:34,773 --> 00:01:37,412
<i>Go back to the Shadow.</i>

4
00:01:38,293 --> 00:01:41,922
<i>The dark flre wlll not avall you,</i>
<i>flame of Udûn!</i>

5
00:01:45,613 --> 00:01:49,970
You shall not pass!

6
00:02:16,013 --> 00:02:17,651
No! No!

7
00:02:17,813 --> 00:02:19,724
Gandalf!

8
00:02:26,973 --> 00:02:28,645
Fly, you fools.

9
00:02:29,253 --> 00:02:31,050
No!

10
00:02:32,933 --> 00:02:34,924
Gandalf!

11
00:03:40,773 --> 00:03:42,525
Gandalf!

12
00:03:43,493 --> 00:03:45,643
What is it, Mr. Frodo?

13
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:49,165
Nothing.

14
00:03:56,173 --> 00:03:58,164
Just a dream.

15
00:04:13,373 --> 00:04:17,685
Mordor. The one place in Middleearth
we don't want to see any closer.

16
00:04:17,853 --> 00:04:19,969
And it's the one place
we're trying to get to.

17
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:22,365
It's just where we can't get.

18
00:04:23,773 --> 00:04:26,606
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.

19
00:04:28,853 --> 00:04:31,492
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to
come this way.

20
00:04:33,053 --> 00:04:36,204
He didn't mean for a lot of things
to happen, Sam<i>...</i>

21
00:04:37,013 --> 00:04:38,446
<i>...</i>but they did.

22
00:04:50,973 --> 00:04:51,962
Mr. Frodo?

23
00:04:55,733 --> 00:04:57,086
It's the Ring, isn't it?

24
00:04:58,133 --> 00:05:00,522
It's getting heavier.

25
00:05:12,613 --> 00:05:15,252
What food have we got left?
Let me see.

26
00:05:15,933 --> 00:05:17,924
Oh, yes. Lovely.

27
00:05:18,093 --> 00:05:20,732
Lembas bread. And look!

28
00:05:23,093 --> 00:05:25,243
More lembas bread.

29
00:05:35,573 --> 00:05:37,450
I don't usually hold with foreign food<i>...</i>

30
00:05:37,653 --> 00:05:40,486
<i>...</i>but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.

31
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:44,689
Nothing ever dampens your spirits,
does it, Sam?

32
00:05:50,293 --> 00:05:52,488
Those rain clouds might.

33
00:06:05,293 --> 00:06:07,932
This looks strangely familiar.

34
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:10,927
It's because we've been here before.

35
00:06:11,093 --> 00:06:13,527
We're going in circles.

36
00:06:14,253 --> 00:06:16,050
What is that horrid stink?

37
00:06:16,213 --> 00:06:18,283
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.

38
00:06:18,453 --> 00:06:20,330
Can you smell it?
Yes.

39
00:06:22,293 --> 00:06:24,409
I can smell it.

40
00:06:27,573 --> 00:06:29,882
We're not alone.

41
00:06:42,973 --> 00:06:46,932
The thieves. The thieves.

42
00:06:47,093 --> 00:06:50,881
The filthy little thieves.

43
00:06:51,533 --> 00:06:53,603
Where is it?

44
00:06:53,773 --> 00:06:56,367
Where is it?

45
00:06:57,013 --> 00:07:00,085
They stole it from us.

46
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:04,292
My precious.

47
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:08,250
Curse them, we hates them!

48
00:07:08,413 --> 00:07:12,372
It's ours, it is, and we wants it!

49
00:08:05,133 --> 00:08:06,851
This is Sting.

50
00:08:07,013 --> 00:08:08,526
You've seen it before<i>...</i>

51
00:08:08,693 --> 00:08:11,082
<i>...</i> haven't you, Gollum?

52
00:08:14,933 --> 00:08:18,289
Release him or I'll cut your throat.

53
00:08:33,693 --> 00:08:35,411
It burns!

54
00:08:35,573 --> 00:08:37,803
It burns us!

55
00:08:39,213 --> 00:08:40,612
It freezes!

56
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:44,528
Nasty Elves twisted it.

57
00:08:44,693 --> 00:08:47,253
Take it off us!
Quiet, you!

58
00:08:50,493 --> 00:08:54,611
It's hopeless. Every Orc in Mordor's
going to hear this racket.

59
00:08:54,773 --> 00:08:57,241
Let's just tie him up and leave him.
No!

60
00:08:57,493 --> 00:09:00,849
That would kill us! Kill us!

61
00:09:01,013 --> 00:09:03,607
It's no more than you deserve!

62
00:09:05,213 --> 00:09:07,204
Maybe he does deserve to die.

63
00:09:09,493 --> 00:09:12,803
But now that I see him, I do pity him.

64
00:09:16,093 --> 00:09:20,803
We be nice to them
if they be nice to us.

65
00:09:21,013 --> 00:09:23,686
Take it off us.

66
00:09:26,653 --> 00:09:30,441
We swears to do what you wants.

67
00:09:30,613 --> 00:09:32,444
We swears.

68
00:09:32,733 --> 00:09:35,088
There's no promise you can make
that I can trust.

69
00:09:37,653 --> 00:09:39,325
We swears<i>...</i>

70
00:09:39,573 --> 00:09:44,089
<i>...</i>to serve the master
of the precious.

71
00:09:45,653 --> 00:09:47,883
We will swear on<i>...</i>

72
00:09:48,053 --> 00:09:49,964
<i>...</i>on the precious.

73
00:09:50,133 --> 00:09:52,203
Gollum. Gollum.

74
00:09:52,373 --> 00:09:56,366
The Ring is treacherous.
It will hold you to your word.

75
00:09:57,173 --> 00:09:58,447
Yes<i>...</i>

76
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:01,362
<i>...</i>on the precious.

77
00:10:03,653 --> 00:10:05,962
On the precious.

78
00:10:07,093 --> 00:10:08,526
I don't believe you!

79
00:10:10,453 --> 00:10:13,809
Get down! I said, down!
Sam!

80
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:15,651
He's trying to trick us.

81
00:10:15,813 --> 00:10:18,771
If we let him go, he'll throttle us
in our sleep.

82
00:10:29,693 --> 00:10:34,050
You know the way to Mordor?
Yes.

83
00:10:36,853 --> 00:10:38,525
You've been there before?

84
00:10:39,493 --> 00:10:41,006
Yes.

85
00:10:51,453 --> 00:10:53,967
You will lead us to the Black Gate.

86
00:11:14,093 --> 00:11:15,412
Merry!

87
00:11:16,373 --> 00:11:17,806
Merry!

88
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:22,527
What is it? What do you smell?

89
00:11:23,453 --> 00:11:25,091
Manflesh.

90
00:11:25,533 --> 00:11:26,966
Aragorn.

91
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:29,962
They've picked up our trail.

92
00:11:30,133 --> 00:11:31,885
Let's move!

93
00:11:52,853 --> 00:11:55,287
Their pace has quickened.

94
00:11:56,253 --> 00:11:58,130
They must have caught our scent.

95
00:11:58,293 --> 00:12:00,011
Hurry!

96
00:12:03,493 --> 00:12:05,165
Come on, Gimli!

97
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:11,048
Three days and nights pursuit.

98
00:12:11,213 --> 00:12:14,046
No food. No rest.

99
00:12:14,213 --> 00:12:18,047
And no sign of our quarry,
but what bare rock can tell.

100
00:12:48,213 --> 00:12:51,250
Not idly do the leaves of Lorien fall.

101
00:12:52,533 --> 00:12:54,808
They may yet be alive.

102
00:12:55,613 --> 00:12:58,127
Less than a day ahead of us. Come.

103
00:13:00,653 --> 00:13:03,042
Come, Gimli! We're gaining on them!

104
00:13:03,213 --> 00:13:07,331
I'm wasted on crosscountry.
We Dwarves are natural sprinters.

105
00:13:07,813 --> 00:13:10,930
Very dangerous over short distances.

106
00:13:22,213 --> 00:13:23,885
Rohan.

107
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:26,726
Home of the Horselords.

108
00:13:27,893 --> 00:13:30,327
There's something strange at work here.

109
00:13:30,493 --> 00:13:33,326
Some evil gives speed
to these creatures.

110
00:13:33,493 --> 00:13:36,371
Sets its will against us.

111
00:13:41,373 --> 00:13:44,126
Legolas! What do your Elfeyes see?

112
00:13:44,293 --> 00:13:46,761
The Uruks turn northeast.

113
00:13:47,573 --> 00:13:49,643
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.

114
00:13:50,453 --> 00:13:51,681
Saruman.

115
00:13:59,733 --> 00:14:02,805
<i>The world Is changlng.</i>

116
00:14:02,973 --> 00:14:08,366
<i>Who now has the strength to stand</i>
<i>agalnst the armles of Isengard...</i>

117
00:14:09,013 --> 00:14:11,652
<i>... and Mordor?</i>

118
00:14:13,253 --> 00:14:18,646
<i>To stand agalnst the mlght of Sauron</i>
<i>and Saruman...</i>

119
00:14:18,813 --> 00:14:22,283
<i>... and the unlon of the two towers?</i>

120
00:14:28,533 --> 00:14:31,411
<i>Together, my Lord Sauron...</i>

121
00:14:31,573 --> 00:14:34,929
<i>... we shall rule thls Mlddleearth.</i>

122
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:54,451
<i>The</i> O<i>ld World wlll burn</i>
<i>In the flres of Industry.</i>

123
00:14:54,973 --> 00:14:58,124
<i>The forests wlll fall.</i>

124
00:14:59,933 --> 00:15:02,686
<i>A new order wlll rlse.</i>

125
00:15:03,733 --> 00:15:08,409
<i>We wlll drlve the machlne of war</i>
<i>wlth the sword and the spear...</i>

126
00:15:08,573 --> 00:15:12,361
<i>... and the Iron flsts of the</i> O<i>rc.</i>

127
00:15:21,213 --> 00:15:26,367
<i>We have only to remove</i>
<i>those who oppose us.</i>

128
00:15:27,413 --> 00:15:29,324
The HorseMen took your lands.

129
00:15:29,493 --> 00:15:33,805
They drove your people into the hills
to scratch a living off rocks.

130
00:15:33,973 --> 00:15:35,372
Murderers!

131
00:15:36,213 --> 00:15:38,283
Take back the lands they stole from you.

132
00:15:38,453 --> 00:15:40,171
Burn every village!

133
00:15:46,693 --> 00:15:49,161
<i>It wlll begln In Rohan.</i>

134
00:15:49,893 --> 00:15:53,283
<i>Too long have these peasants</i>
<i>stood agalnst you.</i>

135
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:55,171
<i>But no more.</i>

136
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:57,483
Eothain! Eothain!

137
00:15:59,573 --> 00:16:02,133
You take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.

138
00:16:02,493 --> 00:16:05,053
Papa says Eothain must not ride Garulf.

139
00:16:05,213 --> 00:16:06,805
He is too big for him.

140
00:16:06,973 --> 00:16:09,851
Listen to me. You must ride to Edoras
and raise the alarm.

141
00:16:10,013 --> 00:16:12,447
Do you understand me?
Yes, Mama.

142
00:16:12,693 --> 00:16:15,491
I don't want to leave.
I don't want to go, Mama.

143
00:16:15,653 --> 00:16:19,248
Freda, I will find you there.

144
00:16:23,933 --> 00:16:25,571
Quickly!

145
00:16:31,733 --> 00:16:33,212
Go, child.

146
00:16:43,653 --> 00:16:45,564
<i>Rohan, my lord...</i>

147
00:16:45,973 --> 00:16:47,611
<i>... Is ready to fall.</i>

148
00:17:12,053 --> 00:17:13,645
Théodred.

149
00:17:26,893 --> 00:17:29,805
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.

150
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:32,522
He was ambushed by Orcs.

151
00:17:34,013 --> 00:17:37,483
If we don't defend our country,
Saruman will take it by force.

152
00:17:37,853 --> 00:17:40,242
That is a lie.

153
00:17:42,373 --> 00:17:47,049
Saruman the White has ever been
our friend and ally.

154
00:17:48,613 --> 00:17:50,569
Grima.

155
00:17:51,893 --> 00:17:53,770
Grima.

156
00:17:56,213 --> 00:17:57,646
Grima.

157
00:17:58,413 --> 00:18:01,325
Orcs are roaming freely
across our lands.

158
00:18:01,733 --> 00:18:05,169
Unchecked. Unchallenged.
Killing at will.

159
00:18:05,813 --> 00:18:08,611
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.

160
00:18:16,133 --> 00:18:21,651
Why do you lay these troubles
on an already troubled mind?

161
00:18:21,813 --> 00:18:24,202
Can you not see?

162
00:18:24,373 --> 00:18:29,208
Your uncle is wearied
by your malcontent<i>...</i>

163
00:18:29,373 --> 00:18:31,807
<i>...</i>your warmongering.

164
00:18:33,933 --> 00:18:35,810
Warmongering?

165
00:18:35,973 --> 00:18:38,043
How long is it since
Saruman bought you?

166
00:18:38,853 --> 00:18:41,128
What was the promised price, Grima?

167
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:44,848
When all the Men are dead,
you will take your share of the treasure?

168
00:18:56,813 --> 00:18:59,373
Too long have you watched my sister.

169
00:18:59,533 --> 00:19:01,444
Too long have you haunted her steps.

170
00:19:09,173 --> 00:19:13,325
You see much, Eomer, son of Eomund.

171
00:19:13,493 --> 00:19:14,608
Too much.

172
00:19:16,853 --> 00:19:22,450
You are banished forthwith
from the kingdom of Rohan<i>...</i>

173
00:19:22,613 --> 00:19:24,808
<i>...</i> under pain of death.

174
00:19:54,453 --> 00:19:57,047
Keep breathing. That's the key.

175
00:19:57,293 --> 00:19:58,931
Breathe.

176
00:20:02,853 --> 00:20:06,528
They've run as if the very whips
of their masters were behind them.

177
00:20:22,053 --> 00:20:24,009
We're not going no further<i>...</i>

178
00:20:24,173 --> 00:20:26,084
<i>...</i> until we've had a breather.

179
00:20:26,613 --> 00:20:28,490
Get a fire going!

180
00:20:32,373 --> 00:20:33,886
Merry!

181
00:20:34,253 --> 00:20:35,527
Merry!

182
00:20:37,173 --> 00:20:42,122
I think we might have made a mistake
leaving the Shire, Pippin.

183
00:20:51,213 --> 00:20:53,329
What's making that noise?

184
00:20:54,813 --> 00:20:56,212
It's the trees.

185
00:20:56,933 --> 00:20:57,968
What?

186
00:20:58,293 --> 00:21:01,968
You remember the Old Forest,
on the borders of Buckland?

187
00:21:02,133 --> 00:21:06,445
Folk used to say there was something
in the water that made the trees grow tall<i>...</i>

188
00:21:06,613 --> 00:21:08,046
<i>...</i>and come alive.

189
00:21:08,293 --> 00:21:09,931
Alive?

190
00:21:10,773 --> 00:21:12,365
Trees that could whisper<i>...</i>

191
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:15,722
<i>...</i>talk to each other<i>...</i>

192
00:21:15,893 --> 00:21:17,645
<i>...</i>even move.

193
00:21:19,213 --> 00:21:21,329
I'm starving.

194
00:21:21,493 --> 00:21:25,406
We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread
for three stinking days.

195
00:21:25,773 --> 00:21:26,967
Yeah!

196
00:21:27,173 --> 00:21:30,290
Why can't we have some meat?!

197
00:21:32,573 --> 00:21:34,689
What about them?

198
00:21:34,853 --> 00:21:36,684
They're fresh.

199
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:40,928
They are not for eating.

200
00:21:46,653 --> 00:21:48,530
What about their legs?

201
00:21:48,693 --> 00:21:50,923
They don't need those.

202
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:55,405
They look tasty.
Get back, scum!

203
00:21:56,933 --> 00:21:59,401
Carve them up!
Just a mouthful.

204
00:21:59,573 --> 00:22:01,006
No!

205
00:22:02,973 --> 00:22:06,409
Looks like meat's back on the menu,
boys.

206
00:22:12,733 --> 00:22:13,961
Pippin.

207
00:22:14,133 --> 00:22:15,725
Let's go.

208
00:22:23,813 --> 00:22:25,292
Go on.

209
00:22:25,453 --> 00:22:26,886
Call for help.

210
00:22:28,213 --> 00:22:29,248
Squeal.

211
00:22:29,453 --> 00:22:32,490
No one's going to save you now.

212
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:42,686
Pippin!

213
00:23:05,973 --> 00:23:08,362
A red sun rises.

214
00:23:08,853 --> 00:23:11,651
Blood has been spilled this night.

215
00:23:41,573 --> 00:23:43,370
Riders of Rohan<i>...</i>

216
00:23:43,773 --> 00:23:46,128
<i>...</i>what news from the Mark?

217
00:24:12,693 --> 00:24:16,925
What business does an Elf, a Man
and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?

218
00:24:17,693 --> 00:24:18,921
Speak quickly!

219
00:24:19,253 --> 00:24:23,724
Give me your name, horsemaster,
and I shall give you mine.

220
00:24:32,453 --> 00:24:34,921
I would cut off your head, Dwarf<i>...</i>

221
00:24:35,373 --> 00:24:37,648
<i>...</i>if it stood but a little higher
from the ground.

222
00:24:38,613 --> 00:24:40,604
You would die before your stroke fell.

223
00:24:48,973 --> 00:24:50,770
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

224
00:24:51,093 --> 00:24:55,132
This is Gimli, son of Gloin,
and Legolas of the Woodland Realm.

225
00:24:55,293 --> 00:24:58,410
We are friends of Rohan
and of Théoden, your king.

226
00:25:00,053 --> 00:25:03,648
Théoden no longer recognizes
friend from foe.

227
00:25:03,893 --> 00:25:05,963
Not even his own kin.

228
00:25:10,293 --> 00:25:12,204
Saruman has poisoned the mind
of the king<i>...</i>

229
00:25:12,373 --> 00:25:14,204
<i>...</i>and claimed lordship over these lands.

230
00:25:16,093 --> 00:25:18,971
My company are those loyal to Rohan.

231
00:25:19,133 --> 00:25:20,851
And for that, we are banished.

232
00:25:22,813 --> 00:25:25,964
The White Wizard is cunning.

233
00:25:26,613 --> 00:25:28,922
He walks here and there, they say<i>...</i>

234
00:25:29,093 --> 00:25:31,049
<i>...</i>as an old man hooded and cloaked.

235
00:25:32,853 --> 00:25:36,482
And everywhere, his spies
slip past our nets.

236
00:25:36,653 --> 00:25:38,769
We are no spies.

237
00:25:38,933 --> 00:25:41,766
We track a party of Urukhai
westward across the plain.

238
00:25:42,053 --> 00:25:44,283
They have taken two of our friends
captive.

239
00:25:45,053 --> 00:25:47,408
The Uruks are destroyed.
We slaughtered them during the night.

240
00:25:47,573 --> 00:25:50,610
But there were two Hobbits.
Did you see two Hobbits with them?

241
00:25:50,773 --> 00:25:53,651
They would be small.
Only children to your eyes.

242
00:25:56,853 --> 00:25:58,764
We left none alive.

243
00:25:59,373 --> 00:26:02,171
We piled the carcasses and burned them.

244
00:26:07,413 --> 00:26:08,607
Dead?

245
00:26:11,493 --> 00:26:13,131
I am sorry.

246
00:26:18,453 --> 00:26:20,683
Hasufel! Arod!

247
00:26:22,413 --> 00:26:26,884
May these horses bear you to better
fortune than their former masters.

248
00:26:28,093 --> 00:26:29,651
Farewell.

249
00:26:34,613 --> 00:26:36,763
Look for your friends.

250
00:26:37,173 --> 00:26:39,323
But do not trust to hope.

251
00:26:40,973 --> 00:26:43,407
It has forsaken these lands.

252
00:26:43,613 --> 00:26:45,524
We ride north!

253
00:27:34,093 --> 00:27:35,845
It's one of their wee belts.

254
00:27:49,053 --> 00:27:51,009
We failed them.

255
00:28:04,493 --> 00:28:06,563
A Hobbit lay here.

256
00:28:08,373 --> 00:28:09,965
And the other.

257
00:28:20,293 --> 00:28:21,806
They crawled.

258
00:28:25,813 --> 00:28:27,849
Their hands were bound.

259
00:28:39,493 --> 00:28:41,245
Their bonds were cut.

260
00:28:56,053 --> 00:28:58,123
They ran over here.

261
00:29:01,613 --> 00:29:02,762
They were followed.

262
00:29:05,813 --> 00:29:07,485
The belt!

263
00:29:11,253 --> 00:29:12,322
Run!

264
00:29:15,893 --> 00:29:17,167
Tracks lead away from the battle<i>...</i>

265
00:29:21,813 --> 00:29:23,849
<i>...</i>into Fangorn Forest.

266
00:29:24,693 --> 00:29:26,092
Fangorn?

267
00:29:26,253 --> 00:29:28,767
What madness drove them in there?

268
00:29:45,773 --> 00:29:48,685
Did we lose him? I think we lost him.

269
00:29:55,093 --> 00:29:58,369
I'm going to rip out
your filthy little innards!

270
00:30:04,333 --> 00:30:05,322
Come here!

271
00:30:10,613 --> 00:30:13,047
Trees. Climb a tree.

272
00:30:22,013 --> 00:30:23,685
He's gone.

273
00:30:35,253 --> 00:30:37,483
Merry!

274
00:30:48,493 --> 00:30:52,691
Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!

275
00:30:59,533 --> 00:31:01,012
Run, Merry!

276
00:31:10,413 --> 00:31:14,565
Little Orcs.

277
00:31:14,733 --> 00:31:16,963
It's talking, Merry.
The tree is talking.

278
00:31:17,133 --> 00:31:18,930
Tree?

279
00:31:19,093 --> 00:31:21,971
I am no tree!

280
00:31:22,173 --> 00:31:24,289
I am an Ent.

281
00:31:24,813 --> 00:31:26,883
A treeherder.

282
00:31:27,053 --> 00:31:28,930
A shepherd of the forest.

283
00:31:29,093 --> 00:31:30,412
Don't talk to it, Merry.

284
00:31:30,893 --> 00:31:32,292
Don't encourage it!

285
00:31:32,493 --> 00:31:36,532
Treebeard, some call me.

286
00:31:36,693 --> 00:31:38,604
And whose side are you on?

287
00:31:39,173 --> 00:31:40,731
Side?

288
00:31:40,933 --> 00:31:43,686
I am on nobody's side<i>...</i>

289
00:31:44,053 --> 00:31:49,173
<i>...</i>because nobody's on my side,
little Orc.

290
00:31:49,933 --> 00:31:54,370
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.

291
00:31:54,733 --> 00:31:57,008
We're not Orcs! We're Hobbits!

292
00:31:57,173 --> 00:31:59,403
Hobbits?

293
00:32:00,573 --> 00:32:05,249
Never heard of a Hobbit before.

294
00:32:06,413 --> 00:32:10,725
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!

295
00:32:10,893 --> 00:32:13,009
They come with fire.

296
00:32:13,173 --> 00:32:15,641
They come with axes.

297
00:32:15,853 --> 00:32:20,449
Gnawing, biting, breaking,
hacking, burning!

298
00:32:20,653 --> 00:32:24,282
Destroyers and usurpers! Curse them!
No!

299
00:32:24,493 --> 00:32:27,212
You don't understand. We're Hobbits!

300
00:32:27,413 --> 00:32:29,131
Halflings!

301
00:32:29,293 --> 00:32:30,362
Shirefolk!

302
00:32:30,533 --> 00:32:32,763
Maybe you are<i>...</i>

303
00:32:33,053 --> 00:32:36,523
<i>...</i>and maybe you aren't.

304
00:32:37,613 --> 00:32:41,322
The White Wizard will know.

305
00:32:42,133 --> 00:32:43,964
The White Wizard?

306
00:32:45,453 --> 00:32:46,886
Saruman.

307
00:32:58,933 --> 00:33:00,525
See? See?

308
00:33:00,733 --> 00:33:03,042
We've led you out.

309
00:33:03,213 --> 00:33:05,647
Hurry, Hobbitses. Hurry!

310
00:33:08,573 --> 00:33:11,007
Very lucky we find you.

311
00:33:17,413 --> 00:33:19,085
Nice Hobbit.

312
00:33:21,853 --> 00:33:25,004
It's a bog. He's led us into a swamp.

313
00:33:25,173 --> 00:33:27,687
A swamp, yes, yes.

314
00:33:28,373 --> 00:33:32,924
Come, master. We will take you
on safe paths through the mist.

315
00:33:35,133 --> 00:33:38,443
Come, Hobbits! Come! We go quickly.

316
00:33:41,573 --> 00:33:44,087
I found it. I did.

317
00:33:44,293 --> 00:33:46,853
The way through the marshes.

318
00:33:47,053 --> 00:33:50,409
Orcs don't use it.
Orcs don't know it.

319
00:33:50,613 --> 00:33:54,492
They go around for miles and miles.

320
00:33:54,693 --> 00:33:56,046
Come quickly.

321
00:33:56,253 --> 00:34:00,166
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.

322
00:34:16,533 --> 00:34:18,285
There are dead things!

323
00:34:18,453 --> 00:34:20,171
Dead faces in the water.

324
00:34:24,813 --> 00:34:28,601
All dead. All rotten.

325
00:34:29,093 --> 00:34:32,688
Elves and Men and Orcses.

326
00:34:32,893 --> 00:34:36,363
A great battle long ago.

327
00:34:37,173 --> 00:34:38,811
Dead Marshes.

328
00:34:39,013 --> 00:34:41,652
Yes. Yes, that is their name.

329
00:34:43,253 --> 00:34:44,925
This way.

330
00:34:45,093 --> 00:34:47,732
Don't follow the lights.

331
00:34:49,413 --> 00:34:53,122
Careful now! Or Hobbits go down
to join the dead ones<i>...</i>

332
00:34:53,333 --> 00:34:57,246
<i>...</i>and light little candles
of their own.

333
00:35:22,413 --> 00:35:23,846
Frodo!

334
00:36:06,493 --> 00:36:10,964
Gollum?
Don't follow the lights.

335
00:36:11,133 --> 00:36:12,930
Gollum!
Mr. Frodo!

336
00:36:13,093 --> 00:36:14,890
Are you all right?

337
00:36:42,573 --> 00:36:45,406
So bright.

338
00:36:45,613 --> 00:36:49,242
So beautiful.

339
00:36:49,413 --> 00:36:53,088
Our precious.

340
00:36:54,493 --> 00:36:55,972
What did you say?

341
00:36:56,133 --> 00:36:58,283
Master should be resting.

342
00:36:58,453 --> 00:37:02,332
Master needs to keep up his strength.

343
00:37:04,213 --> 00:37:07,364
Who are you?
Mustn't ask us. Not its business.

344
00:37:07,533 --> 00:37:08,966
Gollum. Gollum.

345
00:37:09,133 --> 00:37:10,851
Gandalf told me you were
one of the riverfolk.

346
00:37:11,013 --> 00:37:14,926
<i>Cold be heart and hand and bone</i>
<i>Cold be travelers far from home</i>

347
00:37:15,093 --> 00:37:16,606
He said your life was a sad story.

348
00:37:16,813 --> 00:37:21,170
<i>They do not see what Iles ahead</i>
<i>When sun has falled and moon Is dead</i>

349
00:37:21,333 --> 00:37:24,211
You were not so very different
from a Hobbit once.

350
00:37:24,373 --> 00:37:26,045
Were you?

351
00:37:28,173 --> 00:37:30,289
Sméagol.

352
00:37:34,813 --> 00:37:37,247
What did you call me?

353
00:37:38,533 --> 00:37:41,172
That was your name once, wasn't it?

354
00:37:41,733 --> 00:37:44,008
A long time ago.

355
00:37:44,813 --> 00:37:46,883
My name.

356
00:37:47,893 --> 00:37:49,326
My name.

357
00:37:55,973 --> 00:37:58,362
Sméagol.

358
00:38:02,293 --> 00:38:03,885
Black Riders!

359
00:38:04,053 --> 00:38:05,327
Hide! Hide!

360
00:38:15,453 --> 00:38:17,648
Come on, Frodo. Come on!

361
00:38:17,813 --> 00:38:21,328
Quick! They will see us!
They will see us!

362
00:38:22,053 --> 00:38:24,613
I thought they were dead.
Dead?

363
00:38:24,773 --> 00:38:27,571
No, you cannot kill them. No.

364
00:38:53,653 --> 00:38:54,688
Wraiths!

365
00:38:54,893 --> 00:38:57,009
Wraiths on wings!

366
00:39:04,653 --> 00:39:06,609
They are calling for it.

367
00:39:06,813 --> 00:39:10,203
They are calling for the precious.

368
00:39:12,253 --> 00:39:14,289
Mr. Frodo! It's all right.

369
00:39:14,453 --> 00:39:15,681
I'm here.

370
00:39:31,013 --> 00:39:32,526
Hurry, Hobbits.

371
00:39:33,013 --> 00:39:36,801
The Black Gate is very close.

372
00:39:43,413 --> 00:39:45,165
Orc blood.

373
00:39:54,773 --> 00:39:56,491
These are strange tracks.

374
00:39:57,693 --> 00:39:59,649
The air is so close in here.

375
00:40:00,733 --> 00:40:03,088
This forest is old.

376
00:40:03,813 --> 00:40:05,769
Very old.

377
00:40:07,413 --> 00:40:09,643
Full of memory<i>...</i>

378
00:40:12,133 --> 00:40:14,363
<i>...</i>and anger.

379
00:40:20,293 --> 00:40:23,091
The trees are speaking to each other.

380
00:40:23,253 --> 00:40:24,686
Gimli!

381
00:40:24,853 --> 00:40:26,684
Lower your ax.

382
00:40:32,933 --> 00:40:34,332
Something's out there.

383
00:40:40,653 --> 00:40:42,325
What do you see?

384
00:40:42,933 --> 00:40:45,242
The White Wizard approaches.

385
00:40:51,173 --> 00:40:55,291
Do not let him speak.
He will put a spell on us.

386
00:41:04,493 --> 00:41:06,643
We must be quick.

387
00:41:21,573 --> 00:41:25,088
You are tracking the footsteps
of two young Hobbits.

388
00:41:25,653 --> 00:41:27,006
Where are they?

389
00:41:27,173 --> 00:41:30,609
They passed this way
the day before yesterday.

390
00:41:30,773 --> 00:41:34,846
They met someone they did not expect.

391
00:41:35,013 --> 00:41:37,049
Does that comfort you?

392
00:41:37,213 --> 00:41:39,090
Who are you?

393
00:41:40,533 --> 00:41:42,410
Show yourself!

394
00:41:50,933 --> 00:41:52,844
It cannot be.

395
00:42:01,773 --> 00:42:03,206
You fell.

396
00:42:04,613 --> 00:42:07,047
Through fire<i>...</i>

397
00:42:07,213 --> 00:42:08,441
<i>...</i>and water.

398
00:42:09,853 --> 00:42:12,287
<i>From the lowest dungeon</i>
<i>to the hlghest peak...</i>

399
00:42:12,453 --> 00:42:16,048
<i>... I fought wlth the Balrog</i>
<i>of Morgoth.</i>

400
00:42:31,253 --> 00:42:33,847
<i>U ntll at last I threw down</i>
<i>my enemy...</i>

401
00:42:34,013 --> 00:42:38,291
<i>... and smote hls ruln</i>
<i>upon the mountalnslde.</i>

402
00:42:44,053 --> 00:42:46,521
<i>Darkness took me...</i>

403
00:42:47,253 --> 00:42:51,166
<i>... and I strayed out of thought</i>
<i>and tlme.</i>

404
00:42:51,893 --> 00:42:54,851
<i>Stars wheeled overhead...</i>

405
00:42:55,093 --> 00:42:59,405
<i>... and every day was as long</i>
<i>as a Ilfe age of the Earth.</i>

406
00:43:01,453 --> 00:43:03,489
<i>But It was not the end.</i>

407
00:43:03,733 --> 00:43:06,452
<i>I felt Ilfe In me agaln.</i>

408
00:43:08,293 --> 00:43:10,727
<i>I've been sent back...</i>

409
00:43:10,893 --> 00:43:12,372
<i>...</i> until my task is done.

410
00:43:12,813 --> 00:43:14,610
Gandalf.

411
00:43:15,253 --> 00:43:17,164
Gandalf?

412
00:43:17,573 --> 00:43:19,291
Yes.

413
00:43:21,973 --> 00:43:23,691
That was what they used to call me.

414
00:43:26,453 --> 00:43:28,603
Gandalf the Grey.

415
00:43:29,893 --> 00:43:31,565
That was my name.

416
00:43:31,733 --> 00:43:33,132
Gandalf.

417
00:43:35,013 --> 00:43:37,004
I am Gandalf the White.

418
00:43:39,893 --> 00:43:42,851
And I come back to you now<i>...</i>

419
00:43:43,013 --> 00:43:45,402
<i>...</i>at the turn of the tide.

420
00:43:45,573 --> 00:43:48,406
One stage of your journey is over.
Another begins.

421
00:43:48,573 --> 00:43:52,771
War has come to Rohan.
We must ride to Edoras with all speed.

422
00:44:14,013 --> 00:44:15,412
That is one of the Mearas<i>...</i>

423
00:44:15,573 --> 00:44:18,246
<i>...</i> unless my eyes are cheated
by some spell.

424
00:44:35,133 --> 00:44:37,328
Shadowfax.

425
00:44:39,733 --> 00:44:42,293
He is the lord of all horses<i>...</i>

426
00:44:43,853 --> 00:44:47,607
<i>...</i>and has been my friend
through many dangers.

427
00:45:01,653 --> 00:45:05,646
<i>My home Iles deep In the forest...</i>

428
00:45:05,853 --> 00:45:09,607
<i>... near the roots of the mountaln.</i>

429
00:45:11,893 --> 00:45:15,283
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.

430
00:45:15,453 --> 00:45:19,162
And safe is where I'll keep you.

431
00:45:19,933 --> 00:45:23,562
The trees have grown wild
and dangerous.

432
00:45:24,093 --> 00:45:27,130
Anger festers in their hearts.

433
00:45:27,293 --> 00:45:29,761
They will harm you if they can.

434
00:45:30,653 --> 00:45:33,690
There are too few of us now.

435
00:45:33,853 --> 00:45:38,449
Too few of us Ents
left to manage them.

436
00:45:46,093 --> 00:45:50,769
The Black Gate of Mordor.

437
00:45:53,453 --> 00:45:55,842
Oh, save us.

438
00:46:01,373 --> 00:46:04,490
My old Gaffer would have a thing or two
to say if he could see us now.

439
00:46:06,613 --> 00:46:10,925
Master says to show him
the way into Mordor.

440
00:46:11,093 --> 00:46:14,369
So good Sméagol does,
master says so.

441
00:46:14,533 --> 00:46:15,727
I did.

442
00:46:24,093 --> 00:46:26,049
That's it, then.

443
00:46:27,533 --> 00:46:28,761
We can't get past that.

444
00:47:12,133 --> 00:47:13,407
Look!

445
00:47:13,573 --> 00:47:14,972
The gate.

446
00:47:15,133 --> 00:47:16,282
It's opening!

447
00:47:23,413 --> 00:47:25,324
I can see a way down.

448
00:47:25,973 --> 00:47:28,043
Sam, no!

449
00:47:30,133 --> 00:47:31,407
Master!

450
00:48:51,853 --> 00:48:55,243
I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
I know, Mr. Frodo.

451
00:48:55,973 --> 00:48:59,010
I doubt even these Elvish cloaks
will hide us in there.

452
00:48:59,413 --> 00:49:01,165
Now!
No!

453
00:49:01,733 --> 00:49:03,644
No! No, master!

454
00:49:03,813 --> 00:49:06,691
They catch you! They catch you!

455
00:49:07,893 --> 00:49:10,361
Don't take it to him.

456
00:49:13,173 --> 00:49:15,812
He wants the precious.

457
00:49:15,973 --> 00:49:18,885
Always he is looking for it.

458
00:49:19,053 --> 00:49:22,762
And the precious is wanting
to go back to him.

459
00:49:23,013 --> 00:49:26,767
But we mustn't let him have it.

460
00:49:32,813 --> 00:49:34,929
No! There's another way.

461
00:49:35,093 --> 00:49:37,653
More secret. A dark way.

462
00:49:37,933 --> 00:49:41,448
Why haven't you spoken of this before?
Because master did not ask.

463
00:49:41,893 --> 00:49:42,928
He's up to something.

464
00:49:43,533 --> 00:49:46,001
Are you saying there's another way
into Mordor?

465
00:49:46,173 --> 00:49:48,812
Yes. There's a path<i>...</i>

466
00:49:48,973 --> 00:49:51,362
<i>...</i>and some stairs.

467
00:49:51,573 --> 00:49:53,165
And then<i>...</i>

468
00:49:53,333 --> 00:49:56,530
<i>...</i>a tunnel.

469
00:50:09,933 --> 00:50:11,651
He's led us this far, Sam.

470
00:50:11,813 --> 00:50:13,166
Mr. Frodo, no.

471
00:50:14,253 --> 00:50:15,652
He's been true to his word.

472
00:50:20,333 --> 00:50:21,482
No.

473
00:50:23,533 --> 00:50:25,091
Lead the way, Sméagol.

474
00:50:25,653 --> 00:50:29,441
Good Sméagol always helps.

475
00:50:54,893 --> 00:50:58,602
Edoras and the Golden Hall
of Meduseld.

476
00:50:59,333 --> 00:51:01,893
There dwells Théoden, King of Rohan<i>...</i>

477
00:51:02,533 --> 00:51:05,331
<i>... whose mlnd Is overthrown.</i>

478
00:51:05,493 --> 00:51:09,611
<i>Saruman 's hold over Klng Théoden</i>
<i>Is now very strong.</i>

479
00:51:10,213 --> 00:51:13,250
My lord, your son<i>...</i>

480
00:51:13,413 --> 00:51:15,529
<i>...</i> he is dead.

481
00:51:16,973 --> 00:51:18,691
My lord?

482
00:51:19,893 --> 00:51:21,008
Uncle?

483
00:51:27,573 --> 00:51:29,723
Will you not go to him?

484
00:51:32,693 --> 00:51:35,002
Will you do nothing?

485
00:51:35,173 --> 00:51:37,084
Be careful what you say.

486
00:51:37,293 --> 00:51:39,329
Do not look for welcome here.

487
00:52:02,453 --> 00:52:06,446
Oh, he must have died
sometime in the night.

488
00:52:06,613 --> 00:52:08,683
What a tragedy for the king<i>...</i>

489
00:52:08,853 --> 00:52:11,731
<i>...</i>to lose his only son and heir.

490
00:52:12,773 --> 00:52:17,130
I understand.
His passing is hard to accept.

491
00:52:17,293 --> 00:52:21,969
Especially now that your brother
has deserted you.

492
00:52:22,133 --> 00:52:23,566
Leave me alone, snake!

493
00:52:24,973 --> 00:52:26,531
Oh, but you are alone.

494
00:52:28,093 --> 00:52:32,689
Who knows what you've spoken
to the darkness<i>...</i>

495
00:52:32,853 --> 00:52:36,129
<i>...</i>in the bitter watches of the night<i>...</i>

496
00:52:36,293 --> 00:52:39,842
<i>...</i>when all your life seems to shrink.

497
00:52:40,013 --> 00:52:44,052
The walls of your bower
closing in about you.

498
00:52:44,213 --> 00:52:48,570
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.

499
00:52:50,733 --> 00:52:52,530
So fair.

500
00:52:53,773 --> 00:52:55,092
So cold.

501
00:52:56,773 --> 00:52:58,923
Like a morning of pale spring<i>...</i>

502
00:52:59,093 --> 00:53:02,403
<i>...</i>still clinging to winter's chill.

503
00:53:15,573 --> 00:53:17,962
Your words are poison.

504
00:54:46,733 --> 00:54:49,122
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.

505
00:55:02,933 --> 00:55:06,562
I cannot allow you before Théoden King
so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.

506
00:55:08,013 --> 00:55:10,447
By order of Grima Wormtongue.

507
00:55:27,093 --> 00:55:28,765
Your staff.

508
00:55:32,053 --> 00:55:35,409
You would not part an old man
from his walking stick.

509
00:55:53,453 --> 00:55:56,206
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.

510
00:56:04,173 --> 00:56:05,652
He's a herald of woe.

511
00:56:05,813 --> 00:56:10,091
The courtesy of your hall
is somewhat lessened of late<i>...</i>

512
00:56:11,133 --> 00:56:12,532
<i>...</i>Théoden King.

513
00:56:13,173 --> 00:56:15,607
He's not welcome.

514
00:56:16,533 --> 00:56:21,607
Why should I welcome you<i>...</i>

515
00:56:22,093 --> 00:56:25,608
<i>...</i>Gandalf Stormcrow?

516
00:56:25,773 --> 00:56:28,924
A just question, my liege.

517
00:56:29,093 --> 00:56:31,846
Late is the hour<i>...</i>

518
00:56:32,013 --> 00:56:35,801
<i>...</i>in which this conjurer
chooses to appear.

519
00:56:36,573 --> 00:56:38,564
Lathspell I name him.

520
00:56:38,733 --> 00:56:41,486
Ill news is an ill guest.

521
00:56:41,653 --> 00:56:46,044
Be silent. Keep your forked tongue
behind your teeth.

522
00:56:46,213 --> 00:56:48,044
I have not passed
through fire and death<i>...</i>

523
00:56:48,213 --> 00:56:51,330
<i>...</i>to bandy crooked words
with a witless worm.

524
00:56:52,253 --> 00:56:54,289
His staff.

525
00:56:54,453 --> 00:56:58,446
I told you to take the wizard's staff.

526
00:57:01,653 --> 00:57:03,484
Théoden<i>...</i>

527
00:57:04,053 --> 00:57:06,487
<i>...</i>son of Thengel<i>...</i>

528
00:57:08,213 --> 00:57:10,443
<i>...</i>too long have you sat
in the Shadows.

529
00:57:13,333 --> 00:57:16,450
I would stay still if I were you.

530
00:57:16,613 --> 00:57:18,604
Hearken to me!

531
00:57:23,893 --> 00:57:25,963
I release you<i>...</i>

532
00:57:26,133 --> 00:57:28,010
<i>...</i>from the spell.

533
00:57:39,093 --> 00:57:41,971
You have no power here<i>...</i>

534
00:57:42,133 --> 00:57:45,648
<i>...</i>Gandalf the Grey.

535
00:57:50,813 --> 00:57:55,682
I will draw you, Saruman,
as poison is drawn from a wound.

536
00:58:04,693 --> 00:58:06,172
Wait.

537
00:58:07,573 --> 00:58:11,248
If I go, Théoden dies.

538
00:58:11,893 --> 00:58:14,009
You did not kill me<i>...</i>

539
00:58:14,173 --> 00:58:16,289
<i>...</i>you will not kill him.

540
00:58:20,053 --> 00:58:21,645
Rohan is mine.

541
00:58:23,093 --> 00:58:24,367
Be gone.

542
00:59:07,053 --> 00:59:09,089
I know your face.

543
00:59:13,493 --> 00:59:14,687
Eowyn.

544
00:59:16,893 --> 00:59:18,121
Eowyn.

545
00:59:26,053 --> 00:59:27,202
Gandalf?

546
00:59:27,733 --> 00:59:30,452
Breathe the free air again, my friend.

547
00:59:43,293 --> 00:59:45,807
Dark have been my dreams of late.

548
00:59:49,773 --> 00:59:53,368
Your fingers would remember
their old strength better<i>...</i>

549
00:59:53,533 --> 00:59:56,366
<i>...</i>if they grasped your sword.

550
01:00:39,653 --> 01:00:41,564
I've only<i>...</i>

551
01:00:41,733 --> 01:00:44,691
<i>...</i>ever served you, my lord.

552
01:00:44,853 --> 01:00:49,643
Your leechcraft would have had me
crawling on all fours like a beast!

553
01:00:50,613 --> 01:00:52,444
Send me not from your sight.

554
01:00:54,653 --> 01:00:57,292
No, my lord! No, my lord.

555
01:00:57,493 --> 01:00:58,608
Let him go.

556
01:00:59,293 --> 01:01:02,410
Enough blood has been spilt
on his account.

557
01:01:03,813 --> 01:01:06,043
Get out of my way!

558
01:01:08,213 --> 01:01:11,250
Hail, Théoden King!

559
01:01:34,853 --> 01:01:37,287
Where is Théodred?

560
01:01:40,173 --> 01:01:42,607
Where is my son?

561
01:01:46,293 --> 01:01:47,965
Simbelmynë.

562
01:01:52,893 --> 01:01:56,363
Ever has it grown on the tombs
of my forebearers.

563
01:02:00,053 --> 01:02:02,886
Now it shall cover the grave
of my son.

564
01:02:04,933 --> 01:02:08,642
Alas that these evil days
should be mine.

565
01:02:09,373 --> 01:02:13,605
The young perish and the old linger.

566
01:02:14,173 --> 01:02:16,209
That I should live<i>...</i>

567
01:02:16,373 --> 01:02:19,570
<i>...</i>to see the last days of my house.

568
01:02:20,773 --> 01:02:24,482
Théodred's death
was not of your making.

569
01:02:27,413 --> 01:02:30,644
No parent should have to bury
their child.

570
01:02:46,693 --> 01:02:48,490
He was strong in life.

571
01:02:49,533 --> 01:02:52,969
His spirit will find its way
to the halls of your fathers.

572
01:03:35,733 --> 01:03:37,564
They had no warning.

573
01:03:37,733 --> 01:03:40,042
They were unarmed.

574
01:03:40,493 --> 01:03:44,372
Now the Wild Men are moving through
the Westfold, burning as they go.

575
01:03:45,253 --> 01:03:47,130
Rick, cot and tree.

576
01:03:47,413 --> 01:03:49,563
Where is Mama?

577
01:03:50,293 --> 01:03:54,366
This is but a taste of the terror
that Saruman will unleash.

578
01:03:54,533 --> 01:03:58,765
All the more potent for he is driven now
by fear of Sauron.

579
01:04:00,293 --> 01:04:03,171
Ride out and meet him head on.

580
01:04:03,893 --> 01:04:07,249
Draw him away from your women
and children.

581
01:04:07,573 --> 01:04:09,131
You must fight.

582
01:04:09,293 --> 01:04:12,968
You have 2000 good men riding north
as we speak.

583
01:04:13,133 --> 01:04:14,691
Eomer is loyal to you.

584
01:04:14,853 --> 01:04:17,447
His men will return
and fight for their king.

585
01:04:17,613 --> 01:04:21,322
They will be 300 leagues from here
by now.

586
01:04:24,853 --> 01:04:27,003
Eomer cannot help us.

587
01:04:27,573 --> 01:04:29,325
I know what it is you want of me<i>...</i>

588
01:04:29,493 --> 01:04:32,610
<i>...</i>but I will not bring further death
to my people.

589
01:04:34,213 --> 01:04:35,851
I will not risk open war.

590
01:04:37,973 --> 01:04:41,170
Open war is upon you,
whether you would risk it or not.

591
01:04:45,293 --> 01:04:46,851
When last I looked<i>...</i>

592
01:04:47,253 --> 01:04:50,768
<i>...</i>Théoden, not Aragorn,
was king of Rohan.

593
01:04:57,333 --> 01:04:59,528
Then what is the king's decision?

594
01:05:04,853 --> 01:05:06,127
<i>By order of the klng...</i>

595
01:05:06,293 --> 01:05:07,726
<i>...</i>the city must empty.

596
01:05:08,853 --> 01:05:11,572
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.

597
01:05:11,893 --> 01:05:15,602
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.

598
01:05:15,813 --> 01:05:17,246
Helm's Deep.

599
01:05:17,413 --> 01:05:20,803
They flee to the mountains
when they should stand and fight.

600
01:05:20,973 --> 01:05:22,850
Who will defend them if not their king?

601
01:05:23,013 --> 01:05:25,368
He's only doing what he thinks
is best for his people.

602
01:05:25,533 --> 01:05:27,251
Helm's Deep has saved them
in the past.

603
01:05:27,413 --> 01:05:31,167
There is no way out of that ravine.
Théoden is walking into a trap.

604
01:05:31,333 --> 01:05:33,449
He thinks he's leading them to safety.

605
01:05:33,613 --> 01:05:35,683
What they will get is a massacre.

606
01:05:37,173 --> 01:05:39,562
Théoden has a strong will,
but I fear for him.

607
01:05:40,373 --> 01:05:43,570
I fear for the survival of Rohan.

608
01:05:44,053 --> 01:05:46,772
He will need you before the end,
Aragorn.

609
01:05:47,253 --> 01:05:49,926
The people of Rohan will need you.

610
01:05:50,293 --> 01:05:52,648
The defenses have to hold.

611
01:05:54,013 --> 01:05:55,685
They will hold.

612
01:05:59,533 --> 01:06:01,728
The Grey Pilgrim.

613
01:06:01,893 --> 01:06:04,407
That's what they used to call me.

614
01:06:04,573 --> 01:06:09,488
Three hundred lives of Men I've walked
this earth, and now I have no time.

615
01:06:11,013 --> 01:06:13,129
With luck, my search will not
be in vain.

616
01:06:13,653 --> 01:06:16,804
Look to my coming at first light
on the fifth day.

617
01:06:17,653 --> 01:06:20,213
At dawn, look to the east.

618
01:06:20,373 --> 01:06:21,886
Go.

619
01:06:56,773 --> 01:06:58,604
You have some skill with a blade.

620
01:07:06,773 --> 01:07:08,809
Women of this country learned long ago:

621
01:07:08,973 --> 01:07:11,487
Those without swords
can still die upon them.

622
01:07:11,653 --> 01:07:13,405
I fear neither death nor pain.

623
01:07:14,613 --> 01:07:16,649
What do you fear, my lady?

624
01:07:19,893 --> 01:07:21,645
A cage.

625
01:07:22,893 --> 01:07:26,568
To stay behind bars until use
and old age accept them.

626
01:07:26,733 --> 01:07:30,442
And all chance of valor has gone
beyond recall or desire.

627
01:07:33,773 --> 01:07:35,729
You're a daughter of kings<i>...</i>

628
01:07:36,933 --> 01:07:40,084
<i>...</i>a shieldmaiden of Rohan.

629
01:07:45,173 --> 01:07:47,562
I do not think that would be your fate.

630
01:08:19,613 --> 01:08:22,525
<i>Théoden wlll not stay at Edoras.</i>

631
01:08:22,693 --> 01:08:24,684
It's vulnerable. He knows this.

632
01:08:24,853 --> 01:08:27,651
He will expect an attack on the city.

633
01:08:28,893 --> 01:08:32,044
They will flee to Helm's Deep<i>...</i>

634
01:08:32,213 --> 01:08:34,443
<i>...</i>the great fortress of Rohan.

635
01:08:35,573 --> 01:08:39,805
<i>It Is a dangerous road to take</i>
<i>through the mountalns.</i>

636
01:08:41,173 --> 01:08:42,845
<i>They wlll be slow.</i>

637
01:08:43,213 --> 01:08:47,445
They will have women and children
with them.

638
01:08:51,173 --> 01:08:53,323
Send out your Wargriders.

639
01:09:07,613 --> 01:09:10,411
Hey, stinker, don't go getting
too far ahead.

640
01:09:10,573 --> 01:09:13,133
Why do you do that?
What?

641
01:09:13,293 --> 01:09:15,727
Call him names.
Run him down all the time.

642
01:09:16,133 --> 01:09:18,089
Because.

643
01:09:19,573 --> 01:09:21,609
Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.

644
01:09:21,773 --> 01:09:23,889
There's naught left in him
but lies and deceit.

645
01:09:24,293 --> 01:09:26,932
It's the Ring he wants.
It's all he cares about.

646
01:09:27,093 --> 01:09:29,288
You have no idea what it did to him<i>...</i>

647
01:09:29,453 --> 01:09:31,842
<i>...</i>what it's still doing to him.

648
01:09:33,973 --> 01:09:35,964
I want to help him, Sam.

649
01:09:36,133 --> 01:09:37,327
Why?

650
01:09:42,453 --> 01:09:45,445
Because I have to believe
he can come back.

651
01:09:49,493 --> 01:09:51,370
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.

652
01:09:51,533 --> 01:09:54,127
What do you know about it?
Nothing!

653
01:10:00,813 --> 01:10:04,852
I'm sorry, Sam. I don't know
why I said that.

654
01:10:05,653 --> 01:10:06,722
I do.

655
01:10:08,693 --> 01:10:10,445
It's the Ring.

656
01:10:11,013 --> 01:10:12,526
You can't take your eyes off it.

657
01:10:13,213 --> 01:10:15,090
I've seen you.

658
01:10:15,573 --> 01:10:19,248
You're not eating. You barely sleep.

659
01:10:20,933 --> 01:10:23,083
It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.

660
01:10:23,253 --> 01:10:25,813
You have to fight it.
I know what I have to do, Sam.

661
01:10:25,973 --> 01:10:28,806
The Ring was entrusted to me.
It's my task.

662
01:10:28,973 --> 01:10:30,611
Mine! My own!

663
01:10:31,413 --> 01:10:33,483
Can't you hear yourself?

664
01:10:33,653 --> 01:10:35,245
Don't you know who you sound like?

665
01:10:45,093 --> 01:10:47,129
We wants it.

666
01:10:47,293 --> 01:10:49,887
We needs it.

667
01:10:50,053 --> 01:10:54,649
Must have the precious.

668
01:10:54,813 --> 01:10:58,123
They stole it from us.

669
01:10:58,293 --> 01:11:01,490
Sneaky little Hobbitses.

670
01:11:01,653 --> 01:11:05,407
Wicked. Tricksy. False.

671
01:11:05,573 --> 01:11:08,690
No. Not master.

672
01:11:08,853 --> 01:11:12,528
Yes, precious. False.

673
01:11:12,693 --> 01:11:17,005
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!

674
01:11:18,133 --> 01:11:20,488
Master's my friend.

675
01:11:20,653 --> 01:11:25,488
You don't have any friends.
Nobody likes you.

676
01:11:26,733 --> 01:11:29,122
Not listening. I'm not listening.

677
01:11:29,293 --> 01:11:33,127
You're a liar and a thief.

678
01:11:33,733 --> 01:11:35,246
No.

679
01:11:36,093 --> 01:11:38,891
Murderer.

680
01:11:41,253 --> 01:11:42,242
Go away.

681
01:11:42,413 --> 01:11:44,688
Go away?

682
01:11:46,613 --> 01:11:49,286
I hate you.

683
01:11:49,453 --> 01:11:51,728
I hate you.

684
01:11:52,053 --> 01:11:55,204
Where would you be without me?
Gollum. Gollum.

685
01:11:55,373 --> 01:11:57,125
I saved us.

686
01:11:57,293 --> 01:12:01,650
It was me. We survived because of me.

687
01:12:02,773 --> 01:12:06,243
Not anymore.

688
01:12:07,533 --> 01:12:09,012
What did you say?

689
01:12:11,013 --> 01:12:14,688
Master looks after us now.

690
01:12:14,853 --> 01:12:18,209
We don't need you.

691
01:12:18,893 --> 01:12:20,372
What?

692
01:12:20,533 --> 01:12:22,251
Leave now<i>...</i>

693
01:12:22,413 --> 01:12:26,042
<i>...</i>and never come back.

694
01:12:26,213 --> 01:12:27,202
No.

695
01:12:27,693 --> 01:12:31,732
Leave now and never come back.

696
01:12:34,213 --> 01:12:39,890
Leave now and never come back!

697
01:12:51,373 --> 01:12:53,967
We told him to go away.

698
01:12:54,133 --> 01:12:56,966
And away he goes, precious.

699
01:12:57,133 --> 01:12:59,044
Gone! Gone! Gone!

700
01:12:59,213 --> 01:13:00,965
Sméagol is free!

701
01:13:05,653 --> 01:13:07,086
Look.

702
01:13:07,253 --> 01:13:11,565
Look. See what Sméagol finds?

703
01:13:20,693 --> 01:13:22,046
They are young.

704
01:13:22,213 --> 01:13:24,647
They are tender. They are nice.

705
01:13:24,813 --> 01:13:28,203
Yes, they are. Eat them. Eat them!

706
01:13:30,773 --> 01:13:32,331
You'll make him sick, you will<i>...</i>

707
01:13:33,493 --> 01:13:35,563
<i>...</i>behaving like that.

708
01:13:37,893 --> 01:13:40,532
There's only one way to eat
a brace of coneys.

709
01:13:44,253 --> 01:13:45,766
What's it doing?

710
01:13:46,453 --> 01:13:49,013
Stupid, fat Hobbit.

711
01:13:49,173 --> 01:13:51,243
It ruins it.

712
01:13:51,413 --> 01:13:54,928
What's to ruin? There's hardly any meat
on them.

713
01:13:58,893 --> 01:14:01,327
What we need is a few good taters.

714
01:14:02,173 --> 01:14:05,131
What's taters, precious?

715
01:14:05,293 --> 01:14:06,931
What's taters? Eh?

716
01:14:07,093 --> 01:14:08,765
Potatoes.

717
01:14:09,093 --> 01:14:12,210
Boil them, mash them,
stick them in a stew.

718
01:14:13,653 --> 01:14:18,932
Lovely, big, golden chips
with a nice piece of fried fish.

719
01:14:20,173 --> 01:14:21,970
Even you couldn't say no to that.

720
01:14:22,293 --> 01:14:24,409
Oh, yes, we could.

721
01:14:24,573 --> 01:14:27,929
Spoil a nice fish.

722
01:14:29,173 --> 01:14:31,687
Give it to us raw<i>...</i>

723
01:14:31,853 --> 01:14:34,765
<i>...</i>and wriggling.

724
01:14:34,933 --> 01:14:37,925
You keep nasty chips.

725
01:14:38,813 --> 01:14:40,804
You're hopeless.

726
01:14:52,813 --> 01:14:54,246
Mr. Frodo?

727
01:15:11,413 --> 01:15:13,973
Who are they?
Wicked Men.

728
01:15:14,133 --> 01:15:16,488
Servants of Sauron.

729
01:15:17,253 --> 01:15:19,369
They are called to Mordor.

730
01:15:19,533 --> 01:15:22,445
The Dark One is gathering all armies
to him.

731
01:15:22,613 --> 01:15:25,650
It won't be long now.
He will soon be ready.

732
01:15:27,133 --> 01:15:30,648
Ready to do what?
To make his war.

733
01:15:30,813 --> 01:15:35,762
The last war that will cover
all the world in Shadow.

734
01:15:36,053 --> 01:15:38,965
We've got to get moving. Come on, Sam.

735
01:15:39,133 --> 01:15:40,327
Mr. Frodo.

736
01:15:40,813 --> 01:15:42,371
Look.

737
01:15:45,813 --> 01:15:48,043
It's an oliphaunt.

738
01:15:55,893 --> 01:15:58,805
No one at home will believe this.

739
01:16:09,493 --> 01:16:11,290
Sméagol?

740
01:16:50,013 --> 01:16:52,368
We've lingered here too long.

741
01:16:55,253 --> 01:16:56,527
Come on, Sam.

742
01:17:12,373 --> 01:17:14,329
Bind their hands.

743
01:17:23,013 --> 01:17:25,652
It's true, you don't see
many Dwarf women.

744
01:17:25,813 --> 01:17:29,328
And in fact, they are so alike
in voice and appearance<i>...</i>

745
01:17:29,493 --> 01:17:32,530
<i>...</i>that they're often mistaken
for Dwarf men.

746
01:17:32,893 --> 01:17:34,724
It's the beards.

747
01:17:34,933 --> 01:17:36,969
This, in turn, has given rise
to the belief<i>...</i>

748
01:17:37,133 --> 01:17:39,886
<i>...</i>that there are no Dwarf women<i>...</i>

749
01:17:40,053 --> 01:17:44,126
<i>...</i>and that Dwarves just spring out
of holes in the ground<i>...</i>

750
01:17:45,733 --> 01:17:47,530
<i>...</i>which is, of course, ridiculous.

751
01:17:53,373 --> 01:17:55,568
It's all right. Nobody panic.

752
01:17:55,973 --> 01:17:58,771
That was deliberate.
It was deliberate.

753
01:18:16,373 --> 01:18:20,332
<i>The Ilght of the Evenstar</i>
<i>does not wax and wane.</i>

754
01:18:21,053 --> 01:18:24,363
<i>It Is mlne to glve to whom I wlll.</i>

755
01:18:26,133 --> 01:18:28,408
<i>Llke my heart.</i>

756
01:18:29,813 --> 01:18:32,373
<i>Go to sleep.</i>

757
01:18:32,533 --> 01:18:34,922
I am asleep.

758
01:18:41,173 --> 01:18:43,004
This is a dream.

759
01:18:45,173 --> 01:18:48,210
Then it is a good dream.

760
01:18:59,733 --> 01:19:01,769
Sleep.

761
01:19:25,733 --> 01:19:27,212
You told me once<i>...</i>

762
01:19:29,573 --> 01:19:31,643
this day would come.

763
01:19:32,533 --> 01:19:35,172
This is not the end<i>...</i>it is the beginning.

764
01:19:35,333 --> 01:19:37,324
You must go with Frodo.

765
01:19:38,093 --> 01:19:40,129
That is your path.

766
01:19:50,013 --> 01:19:52,686
My path is hidden from me.

767
01:19:53,333 --> 01:19:56,723
It is already laid before your feet.

768
01:19:56,893 --> 01:20:00,090
You cannot falter now.

769
01:20:02,133 --> 01:20:03,964
Arwen<i>...</i>

770
01:20:06,373 --> 01:20:08,489
If you trust nothing else<i>...</i>

771
01:20:08,933 --> 01:20:10,924
trust this<i>...</i>

772
01:20:11,933 --> 01:20:14,003
<i>...</i>trust us.

773
01:20:51,413 --> 01:20:53,165
Where is she?

774
01:20:54,293 --> 01:20:56,648
The woman who gave you that jewel.

775
01:20:59,813 --> 01:21:02,452
O<i>ur tlme here Is endlng.</i>

776
01:21:03,093 --> 01:21:05,561
Arwen's time is ending.

777
01:21:06,293 --> 01:21:07,487
Let her go.

778
01:21:07,653 --> 01:21:09,609
Let her take the ship into the west.

779
01:21:09,773 --> 01:21:12,685
Let her bear away her love for you
to the Undying Lands.

780
01:21:12,853 --> 01:21:14,605
There it will be ever green.

781
01:21:16,053 --> 01:21:18,283
But never more than memory.

782
01:21:19,533 --> 01:21:22,445
I will not leave my daughter here
to die.

783
01:21:22,613 --> 01:21:26,083
She stays because she still has hope.
She stays for you.

784
01:21:26,253 --> 01:21:28,448
She belongs with her people.

785
01:21:33,733 --> 01:21:36,850
You have a chance for another life<i>...</i>

786
01:21:38,773 --> 01:21:43,051
away from war<i>...</i>grief<i>...</i>despair.

787
01:21:43,573 --> 01:21:45,325
Why are you saying this?

788
01:21:46,813 --> 01:21:49,885
I am mortal. You are Elfkind.

789
01:21:52,533 --> 01:21:55,206
It was a dream, Arwen.

790
01:21:55,373 --> 01:21:56,931
Nothing more.

791
01:22:05,413 --> 01:22:07,165
This belongs to you.

792
01:22:09,813 --> 01:22:11,371
It was a gift.

793
01:22:13,893 --> 01:22:15,372
Keep it.

794
01:22:17,773 --> 01:22:18,922
My lord?

795
01:22:21,613 --> 01:22:25,970
She is sailing to the Undying Lands
with all that is left of her kin.

796
01:22:48,493 --> 01:22:49,892
What is it?

797
01:22:51,333 --> 01:22:53,324
Hama?
I'm not sure.

798
01:23:09,173 --> 01:23:11,164
Wargs!

799
01:23:23,173 --> 01:23:24,811
A scout!

800
01:23:30,853 --> 01:23:33,287
What is it? What do you see?
Warg! We're under attack!

801
01:23:34,573 --> 01:23:36,689
Get them out of here!

802
01:23:41,213 --> 01:23:43,169
All riders to the head of the column.

803
01:23:43,853 --> 01:23:45,764
Come on. Get me up here. I'm a rider.

804
01:23:45,933 --> 01:23:47,571
Come on!

805
01:23:58,933 --> 01:24:01,242
You must lead the people
to Helm's Deep, and make haste.

806
01:24:01,453 --> 01:24:02,852
I can fight.
No!

807
01:24:05,453 --> 01:24:07,409
You must do this, for me.

808
01:24:09,333 --> 01:24:10,891
Follow me!

809
01:24:14,253 --> 01:24:18,371
Forward. I mean, charge forward.
Make for the lower ground!

810
01:24:18,573 --> 01:24:21,133
That's it! Go on!
Stay together!

811
01:25:30,093 --> 01:25:32,288
Bring your pretty face to my ax.

812
01:25:34,973 --> 01:25:36,486
That one counts as mine!

813
01:25:52,493 --> 01:25:54,051
Stinking creature.

814
01:27:17,785 --> 01:27:19,616
Aragorn!

815
01:27:24,105 --> 01:27:25,538
Aragorn?

816
01:27:38,945 --> 01:27:41,743
Tell me what happened
and I will ease your passing.

817
01:27:41,905 --> 01:27:43,304
He's<i>...</i>

818
01:27:43,825 --> 01:27:45,383
<i>...</i>dead.

819
01:27:45,985 --> 01:27:48,738
He took a little tumble off the cliff.

820
01:27:52,225 --> 01:27:53,453
You lie.

821
01:28:26,025 --> 01:28:27,538
Get the wounded on horses.

822
01:28:28,785 --> 01:28:31,822
The wolves of Isengard will return.

823
01:28:32,225 --> 01:28:34,261
Leave the dead.

824
01:28:41,385 --> 01:28:42,818
Come.

825
01:28:52,585 --> 01:28:54,098
At last!
Helm's Deep.

826
01:28:54,265 --> 01:28:57,063
There it is, Helm's Deep.

827
01:28:59,465 --> 01:29:01,217
We're safe!

828
01:29:02,665 --> 01:29:05,418
We're safe, my lady.

829
01:29:05,585 --> 01:29:06,734
Thank you.

830
01:29:49,265 --> 01:29:50,618
Mama!
Eothain!

831
01:29:50,785 --> 01:29:52,264
Freda!

832
01:29:56,425 --> 01:30:00,054
Make way for Théoden.
Make way for the king.

833
01:30:07,625 --> 01:30:11,220
So few. So few of you have returned.

834
01:30:13,865 --> 01:30:16,060
Our people are safe.

835
01:30:17,345 --> 01:30:19,779
We have paid for it with many lives.

836
01:30:20,585 --> 01:30:22,064
My lady.

837
01:30:25,625 --> 01:30:27,775
Lord Aragorn<i>...</i>

838
01:30:27,945 --> 01:30:29,139
<i>...</i>where is he?

839
01:30:31,065 --> 01:30:32,544
He fell.

840
01:30:54,305 --> 01:30:57,138
Draw all our forces behind the wall.

841
01:30:57,305 --> 01:31:00,103
Bar the gate.
And set a watch on the surround.

842
01:31:00,345 --> 01:31:03,303
What of those who cannot fight, my lord?
The women and children?

843
01:31:03,465 --> 01:31:05,979
Get them into the caves.

844
01:31:06,825 --> 01:31:11,455
Saruman's arm will have grown long
indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.

845
01:31:13,425 --> 01:31:16,701
<i>Helm 's Deep has one weakness.</i>

846
01:31:16,865 --> 01:31:19,095
<i>Its outer wall Is solld rock...</i>

847
01:31:19,265 --> 01:31:22,223
<i>... but for a small culvert</i>
<i>at Its base...</i>

848
01:31:22,385 --> 01:31:25,058
<i>... whlch Is Ilttle more than a draln.</i>

849
01:31:27,785 --> 01:31:31,778
How? How can fire undo stone?

850
01:31:31,945 --> 01:31:36,302
What kind of device
could bring down the wall?

851
01:31:39,785 --> 01:31:43,619
If the wall is breached,
Helm's Deep will fall.

852
01:31:43,785 --> 01:31:47,141
Even if it is breached, it would take
a number beyond reckoning<i>...</i>

853
01:31:47,305 --> 01:31:49,773
<i>...</i>thousands, to storm the Keep.

854
01:31:49,945 --> 01:31:51,298
Tens of thousands.

855
01:31:51,465 --> 01:31:55,378
But, my lord, there is no such force.

856
01:32:06,825 --> 01:32:09,783
A new power is rising.

857
01:32:09,945 --> 01:32:12,823
Its victory is at hand.

858
01:32:18,265 --> 01:32:20,256
This night<i>...</i>

859
01:32:20,665 --> 01:32:24,817
<i>...</i>the land will be stained
with the blood of Rohan!

860
01:32:24,985 --> 01:32:28,182
March to Helm's Deep!

861
01:32:28,345 --> 01:32:31,701
Leave none alive!

862
01:32:34,105 --> 01:32:36,494
To war!

863
01:32:40,265 --> 01:32:44,543
There will be no dawn for Men.

864
01:33:01,025 --> 01:33:02,981
Look. There's smoke to the south.

865
01:33:03,145 --> 01:33:06,182
There is always smoke rising<i>...</i>

866
01:33:06,385 --> 01:33:10,060
<i>...</i>from Isengard these days.

867
01:33:10,305 --> 01:33:11,818
Isengard?

868
01:33:12,025 --> 01:33:13,822
There was a time<i>...</i>

869
01:33:14,145 --> 01:33:17,535
<i>...</i>when Saruman would walk in my woods.

870
01:33:17,705 --> 01:33:20,902
But now he has a mind of metal<i>...</i>

871
01:33:21,545 --> 01:33:23,900
<i>...</i>and wheels.

872
01:33:24,625 --> 01:33:28,937
He no longer cares for growing things.

873
01:33:29,105 --> 01:33:30,823
What is it?

874
01:33:35,625 --> 01:33:37,741
It's Saruman's army.

875
01:33:37,905 --> 01:33:39,418
The war has started.

876
01:34:16,145 --> 01:34:20,343
<i>May the grace of the Valar</i>
<i>protect you.</i>

877
01:35:18,145 --> 01:35:19,294
Arwen.

878
01:35:20,545 --> 01:35:22,342
It is time.

879
01:35:24,345 --> 01:35:28,020
The ships are leaving for Valinor.
Go now<i>...</i>before it is too late.

880
01:35:28,745 --> 01:35:30,463
I have made my choice.

881
01:35:36,625 --> 01:35:39,378
He is not coming back.

882
01:35:40,745 --> 01:35:43,942
Why do you linger here
when there is no hope?

883
01:35:44,825 --> 01:35:47,703
There is still hope.

884
01:35:51,665 --> 01:35:55,294
If Aragorn survives this war,
you will still be parted.

885
01:35:58,545 --> 01:36:01,378
If Sauron is defeated
and Aragorn made king<i>...</i>

886
01:36:01,545 --> 01:36:03,934
<i>...</i>and all that you hope for
comes true<i>...</i>

887
01:36:04,105 --> 01:36:08,621
<i>...</i>you will still have to taste
the bitterness of mortality.

888
01:36:08,905 --> 01:36:11,783
Whether by the sword
or the slow decay of time<i>...</i>

889
01:36:11,945 --> 01:36:14,743
<i>...</i>Aragorn will die.

890
01:36:17,465 --> 01:36:19,933
<i>And there wlll be no comfort</i>
<i>for you...</i>

891
01:36:20,105 --> 01:36:24,144
<i>... no comfort to ease the paln</i>
<i>of hls passlng.</i>

892
01:36:26,825 --> 01:36:29,464
<i>He wlll come to death...</i>

893
01:36:29,625 --> 01:36:32,093
<i>... an Image of the splendor</i>
<i>of the klngs of Men...</i>

894
01:36:32,265 --> 01:36:36,736
<i>... In glory undlmmed before</i>
<i>the breaklng of the world.</i>

895
01:36:45,465 --> 01:36:49,253
<i>But you, my daughter...</i>

896
01:36:50,025 --> 01:36:54,860
<i>... you wlll Ilnger on In darkness</i>

897
01:36:55,025 --> 01:36:58,938
<i>... as nlghtfall In wlnter</i>

898
01:37:01,225 --> 01:37:03,534
<i>Here you wlll dwell...</i>

899
01:37:03,705 --> 01:37:08,415
<i>... bound to your grlef</i>

01:37:10,065 --> 01:37:11,976
<i>... untll all the world Is changed...</i>

901
01:37:12,145 --> 01:37:16,457
<i>...</i>and the long years of your life
are utterly spent.

902
01:37:24,665 --> 01:37:25,780
Arwen.

903
01:37:32,145 --> 01:37:34,340
There is nothing for you here<i>...</i>

904
01:37:34,505 --> 01:37:36,655
<i>...</i>only death.

905
01:37:56,903 --> 01:37:59,895
Do I not also have your love?

906
01:38:01,463 --> 01:38:03,135
You have my love, father.

907
01:39:06,583 --> 01:39:10,053
<i>The power of the enemy Is growlng.</i>

908
01:39:10,223 --> 01:39:12,737
<i>Sauron wlll use hls puppet,</i>
<i>Saruman...</i>

909
01:39:12,903 --> 01:39:16,213
<i>... to destroy the people of Rohan.</i>

910
01:39:18,183 --> 01:39:21,698
<i>Isengard has been unleashed.</i>

911
01:39:25,823 --> 01:39:29,054
<i>The Eye of Sauron now turns</i>
<i>to Gondor...</i>

912
01:39:30,143 --> 01:39:33,021
<i>... the last free klngdom of Men.</i>

913
01:39:33,183 --> 01:39:37,381
<i>Hls war on thls country</i>
<i>wlll come swlftly.</i>

914
01:39:40,943 --> 01:39:43,935
<i>He senses the Rlng Is close.</i>

915
01:39:44,103 --> 01:39:47,413
<i>The strength of the Rlngbearer</i>
<i>Is falllng.</i>

916
01:39:47,583 --> 01:39:51,462
<i>In hls heart, Frodo beglns</i>
<i>to understand...</i>

917
01:39:52,943 --> 01:39:56,652
<i>...</i>the quest will claim his life.

918
01:39:56,823 --> 01:39:58,893
You know this.

919
01:39:59,463 --> 01:40:02,182
<i>You have foreseen It.</i>

920
01:40:04,223 --> 01:40:07,533
<i>It Is the rlsk we all took.</i>

921
01:40:11,743 --> 01:40:15,782
<i>In the gatherlng dark, the wlll</i>
<i>of the Rlng grows strong.</i>

922
01:40:16,903 --> 01:40:21,135
<i>It works hard now to flnd Its way back</i>
<i>Into the hands of Men.</i>

923
01:40:21,303 --> 01:40:26,536
<i>Men, who are so easlly seduced</i>
<i>by Its power.</i>

924
01:40:26,743 --> 01:40:30,179
<i>The young captaln of Gondor</i>
<i>has but to extend hls hand...</i>

925
01:40:30,343 --> 01:40:34,256
<i>... take the Rlng for hls own,</i>
<i>and the world wlll fall.</i>

926
01:40:36,583 --> 01:40:38,335
<i>It Is close now.</i>

927
01:40:38,503 --> 01:40:42,576
<i>So close to achlevlng Its goal.</i>

928
01:40:45,543 --> 01:40:49,058
<i>For Sauron wlll have domlnlon</i>
<i>over all Ilfe on thls Earth...</i>

929
01:40:49,223 --> 01:40:53,182
<i>... even unto to the endlng</i>
<i>of the world.</i>

930
01:40:54,943 --> 01:40:56,695
<i>The tlme of the Elves...</i>

931
01:40:56,903 --> 01:40:58,734
<i>... Is over.</i>

932
01:40:59,543 --> 01:41:02,979
<i>Do we leave Mlddleearth</i>
<i>to Its fate?</i>

933
01:41:04,863 --> 01:41:07,980
<i>Do we let them stand alone?</i>

934
01:41:12,423 --> 01:41:13,697
What news?

935
01:41:13,863 --> 01:41:16,582
Our scouts report Saruman
has attacked Rohan.

936
01:41:16,743 --> 01:41:19,462
Théoden's people have fled
to Helm's Deep.

937
01:41:19,623 --> 01:41:23,502
But we must look to our own borders.
Faramir, Orcs are on the move.

938
01:41:23,663 --> 01:41:25,972
Sauron is marshaling an army.

939
01:41:26,303 --> 01:41:28,339
Easterlings and Southrons
are at the Black Gate.

940
01:41:28,503 --> 01:41:31,779
How many?
Some thousands. More come every day.

941
01:41:32,823 --> 01:41:36,259
Who's covering the river to the north?
We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath.

942
01:41:36,423 --> 01:41:39,335
If their city is attacked,
we won't hold it.

943
01:41:41,383 --> 01:41:43,453
Saruman attacks from Isengard.

944
01:41:43,623 --> 01:41:46,217
Sauron from Mordor.

945
01:41:47,463 --> 01:41:50,580
The fight will come to Men
on both fronts.

946
01:41:50,743 --> 01:41:52,381
Gondor is weak.

947
01:41:52,543 --> 01:41:55,535
Sauron will strike us soon.

948
01:41:56,263 --> 01:41:58,015
And he will strike hard.

949
01:41:58,463 --> 01:42:02,376
He knows now we do not have
the strength to repel him.

950
01:42:15,743 --> 01:42:17,859
My men tell me that you are Orc spies.

951
01:42:18,023 --> 01:42:20,662
Spies? Now wait just a minute.

952
01:42:20,823 --> 01:42:22,973
Well, if you're not spies,
then who are you?

953
01:42:29,583 --> 01:42:31,255
Speak.

954
01:42:32,303 --> 01:42:34,817
We are Hobbits of the Shire.

955
01:42:35,143 --> 01:42:38,021
Frodo Baggins is my name,
and this is Samwise Gamgee.

956
01:42:38,423 --> 01:42:39,902
Your bodyguard?

957
01:42:40,063 --> 01:42:41,781
His gardener.

958
01:42:42,343 --> 01:42:44,254
And where is your skulking friend?

959
01:42:45,703 --> 01:42:47,933
That gangrel creature.

960
01:42:48,263 --> 01:42:50,140
He had an illfavored look.

961
01:42:51,783 --> 01:42:53,614
There was no other.

962
01:42:57,543 --> 01:42:59,773
We set out from Rivendell
with seven companions.

963
01:43:02,983 --> 01:43:05,941
One we lost in Moria<i>...</i>

964
01:43:06,983 --> 01:43:08,416
<i>...</i>two were my kin<i>...</i>

965
01:43:08,583 --> 01:43:12,178
<i>...</i>a Dwarf there was also.
And an Elf and two Men.

966
01:43:12,343 --> 01:43:16,097
Aragorn, son of Arathorn,
and Boromir of Gondor.

967
01:43:20,903 --> 01:43:22,575
You're a friend of Boromir?

968
01:43:24,903 --> 01:43:26,336
Yes.

969
01:43:27,383 --> 01:43:28,418
For my part.

970
01:43:34,663 --> 01:43:37,496
It will grieve you then to learn
that he is dead.

971
01:43:39,463 --> 01:43:40,862
Dead?

972
01:43:41,023 --> 01:43:42,979
How? When?

973
01:43:43,223 --> 01:43:45,783
As one of his companions,
I'd hoped you would tell me.

974
01:43:51,343 --> 01:43:53,061
He was my brother.

975
01:44:11,503 --> 01:44:13,414
Captain Faramir!

976
01:44:14,663 --> 01:44:16,699
We found the third one.

977
01:44:27,863 --> 01:44:29,774
You must come with me. Now.

978
01:44:40,583 --> 01:44:41,618
Down there.

979
01:44:55,943 --> 01:44:58,662
To enter the Forbidden Pool
bears the penalty of death.

980
01:45:08,863 --> 01:45:10,296
They wait for my command.

981
01:45:15,543 --> 01:45:16,578
Shall I shoot?

982
01:45:17,783 --> 01:45:20,695
<i>The rock and pool</i>
<i>Is nlce and cool</i>

983
01:45:20,863 --> 01:45:22,615
<i>So julcy sweet</i>

984
01:45:23,223 --> 01:45:26,056
O<i>ur only wlsh</i>
<i>To catch a flsh</i>

985
01:45:26,223 --> 01:45:28,817
<i>So julcy sweet</i>

986
01:45:35,543 --> 01:45:36,896
Wait.

987
01:45:38,343 --> 01:45:41,062
This creature is bound to me.

988
01:45:41,623 --> 01:45:43,454
And I to him.

989
01:45:46,623 --> 01:45:47,851
He is our guide.

990
01:45:52,423 --> 01:45:53,742
Please<i>...</i>

991
01:45:53,903 --> 01:45:55,700
<i>...</i>let me go down to him.

992
01:46:06,503 --> 01:46:08,095
Sméagol.

993
01:46:09,063 --> 01:46:11,213
Master is here.

994
01:46:12,383 --> 01:46:13,452
Come, Sméagol.

995
01:46:16,223 --> 01:46:18,737
Trust master. Come.

996
01:46:21,783 --> 01:46:25,458
We must go now?

997
01:46:25,823 --> 01:46:29,099
Sméagol, you must trust master.

998
01:46:29,263 --> 01:46:30,616
Follow me. Come on.

999
01:46:31,783 --> 01:46:33,296
Come.

1000
01:46:35,703 --> 01:46:36,852
Come, Sméagol.

1001
01:46:37,343 --> 01:46:39,299
Nice Sméagol. That's it.

1002
01:46:39,783 --> 01:46:41,262
Come on.

1003
01:46:45,503 --> 01:46:47,095
Don't hurt him!

1004
01:46:47,263 --> 01:46:49,857
Sméagol, don't struggle.
Sméagol, listen to me.

1005
01:46:50,023 --> 01:46:51,297
Master!

1006
01:47:02,143 --> 01:47:03,735
No! No!

1007
01:47:09,703 --> 01:47:11,773
Where are you leading them?

1008
01:47:13,503 --> 01:47:15,095
Answer me.

1009
01:47:15,863 --> 01:47:18,980
Sméagol.

1010
01:47:22,263 --> 01:47:26,814
Why does it cry, Sméagol?

1011
01:47:28,023 --> 01:47:30,537
Cruel Men hurts us.

1012
01:47:30,703 --> 01:47:33,581
Master tricksed us.

1013
01:47:33,743 --> 01:47:37,179
Of course he did.

1014
01:47:37,543 --> 01:47:41,058
I told you he was tricksy.

1015
01:47:41,223 --> 01:47:44,135
I told you he was false.

1016
01:47:44,303 --> 01:47:46,897
Master is our friend.

1017
01:47:47,063 --> 01:47:49,338
Our friend.

1018
01:47:49,503 --> 01:47:51,573
Master betrayed us.

1019
01:47:51,743 --> 01:47:54,621
No. Not its business.

1020
01:47:55,623 --> 01:47:57,978
Leave us alone!

1021
01:47:58,143 --> 01:48:00,418
Filthy little Hobbitses!

1022
01:48:00,583 --> 01:48:02,813
They stole it from us!

1023
01:48:02,983 --> 01:48:04,336
No. No.

1024
01:48:04,903 --> 01:48:06,461
What did they steal?

1025
01:48:08,503 --> 01:48:13,623
My precious!

1026
01:48:17,183 --> 01:48:18,741
We have to get out of here.

1027
01:48:19,303 --> 01:48:21,214
You go. Go, now.

1028
01:48:23,703 --> 01:48:25,500
You can do it.

1029
01:48:26,863 --> 01:48:28,262
Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo.

1030
01:48:28,423 --> 01:48:30,175
Just this once.

1031
01:48:30,343 --> 01:48:32,015
Put it on.

1032
01:48:32,423 --> 01:48:34,379
Disappear.

1033
01:48:35,383 --> 01:48:36,418
I can't.

1034
01:48:39,383 --> 01:48:41,533
You were right, Sam.

1035
01:48:42,903 --> 01:48:45,292
You tried to tell me but<i>...</i>

1036
01:48:49,823 --> 01:48:51,893
I'm sorry.

1037
01:48:56,263 --> 01:48:58,982
The Ring's taking me, Sam.

1038
01:49:00,343 --> 01:49:01,935
If I put it on<i>...</i>

1039
01:49:02,103 --> 01:49:04,333
<i>...</i> he'll find me.

1040
01:49:05,943 --> 01:49:07,820
He'll see.

1041
01:49:09,023 --> 01:49:10,900
Mr. Frodo<i>...</i>

1042
01:49:15,623 --> 01:49:19,741
So this is the answer
to all the riddles.

1043
01:49:21,863 --> 01:49:24,741
Here in the Wild I have you<i>...</i>

1044
01:49:24,903 --> 01:49:26,700
<i>...</i>two Halflings<i>...</i>

1045
01:49:26,863 --> 01:49:29,900
<i>...</i>and a host of men at my call.

1046
01:49:33,063 --> 01:49:36,419
The Ring of Power within my grasp.

1047
01:49:45,703 --> 01:49:49,298
A chance for Faramir,
captain of Gondor<i>...</i>

1048
01:49:50,823 --> 01:49:53,735
<i>...</i>to show his quality.

1049
01:50:14,023 --> 01:50:15,536
No!

1050
01:50:18,583 --> 01:50:19,857
Stop it!

1051
01:50:20,023 --> 01:50:21,058
Leave him alone.

1052
01:50:22,343 --> 01:50:24,732
Don't you understand?

1053
01:50:25,983 --> 01:50:27,780
He's got to destroy it!

1054
01:50:27,943 --> 01:50:31,060
That's where we're going, into Mordor.

1055
01:50:31,223 --> 01:50:32,815
To the Mountain of Fire!

1056
01:50:33,863 --> 01:50:36,821
Osgiliath is under attack.
They call for reinforcements.

1057
01:50:36,983 --> 01:50:39,861
Please. It's such a burden.

1058
01:50:41,943 --> 01:50:43,934
Will you not help him?

1059
01:50:45,223 --> 01:50:47,054
Captain?

1060
01:50:47,703 --> 01:50:49,853
Prepare to leave.

1061
01:50:54,583 --> 01:50:56,892
The Ring will go to Gondor.

1062
01:52:06,943 --> 01:52:09,457
He's alive!
Where is he? Where is he?

1063
01:52:09,623 --> 01:52:12,581
Get out of the way!
I'm going to kill him!

1064
01:52:12,743 --> 01:52:16,338
You are the luckiest, the canniest<i>...</i>

1065
01:52:16,503 --> 01:52:20,382
<i>...</i>and the most reckless man
I ever knew.

1066
01:52:21,023 --> 01:52:22,456
Bless you, laddie.

1067
01:52:22,983 --> 01:52:24,655
Gimli, where is the king?

1068
01:52:33,263 --> 01:52:34,252
You're late.

1069
01:52:37,863 --> 01:52:39,137
You look terrible.

1070
01:53:19,183 --> 01:53:21,174
A great host, you say?

1071
01:53:21,343 --> 01:53:23,903
All Isengard is emptied.
How many?

1072
01:53:24,543 --> 01:53:27,421
Ten thousand strong at least.

1073
01:53:28,903 --> 01:53:30,256
Ten thousand?

1074
01:53:30,663 --> 01:53:33,052
It is an army bred for a single purpose:

1075
01:53:35,623 --> 01:53:37,693
To destroy the world of Men.

1076
01:53:40,103 --> 01:53:42,014
They will be here by nightfall.

1077
01:53:47,623 --> 01:53:48,851
Let them come!

1078
01:53:50,303 --> 01:53:52,942
I want every man and strong lad
able to bear arms<i>...</i>

1079
01:53:53,103 --> 01:53:56,095
<i>...</i>to be ready for battle by nightfall.

1080
01:54:04,023 --> 01:54:06,821
We will cover the causeway
and the gate from above.

1081
01:54:06,983 --> 01:54:09,338
No army has ever breached
the Deeping Wall<i>...</i>

1082
01:54:09,503 --> 01:54:12,097
<i>...</i>or set foot inside the Hornburg!

1083
01:54:12,263 --> 01:54:14,572
This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.

1084
01:54:15,143 --> 01:54:17,259
These are Urukhai.

1085
01:54:17,423 --> 01:54:20,733
Their armour is thick
and their shields broad.

1086
01:54:22,303 --> 01:54:25,818
I have fought many wars,
Master Dwarf.

1087
01:54:25,983 --> 01:54:29,419
I know how to defend my own keep.

1088
01:54:35,783 --> 01:54:39,014
They will break upon this fortress
like water on rock.

1089
01:54:39,183 --> 01:54:44,211
Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn.
We've seen it before.

1090
01:54:44,423 --> 01:54:46,983
Crops can be resown<i>...</i>

1091
01:54:47,143 --> 01:54:50,021
<i>...</i> homes rebuilt.

1092
01:54:50,583 --> 01:54:53,051
Within these walls<i>...</i>

1093
01:54:53,383 --> 01:54:54,816
<i>...</i>we will outlast them.

1094
01:54:54,983 --> 01:54:57,292
They do not come to destroy Rohan's
crops or villages.

1095
01:54:57,463 --> 01:54:58,976
They come to destroy its people<i>...</i>

1096
01:54:59,143 --> 01:55:01,532
<i>...</i>down to the last child.

1097
01:55:02,343 --> 01:55:04,538
What would you have me do?

1098
01:55:04,703 --> 01:55:06,341
Look at my men.

1099
01:55:06,503 --> 01:55:08,175
Their courage hangs by a thread.

1100
01:55:10,303 --> 01:55:14,501
If this is to be our end, then I would
have them make such an end<i>...</i>

1101
01:55:14,663 --> 01:55:17,575
<i>...</i>as to be worthy of remembrance.

1102
01:55:21,063 --> 01:55:22,894
Send out riders, my lord.

1103
01:55:23,183 --> 01:55:25,936
You must call for aid.

1104
01:55:29,063 --> 01:55:31,258
And who will come?

1105
01:55:31,623 --> 01:55:33,181
Elves?

1106
01:55:33,343 --> 01:55:35,299
Dwarves?

1107
01:55:36,063 --> 01:55:38,816
We are not so lucky in our friends
as you.

1108
01:55:39,623 --> 01:55:41,773
The old alliances are dead.

1109
01:55:42,183 --> 01:55:44,902
Gondor will answer.
Gondor?!

1110
01:55:45,063 --> 01:55:47,133
Where was Gondor
when the Westfold fell?!

1111
01:55:48,103 --> 01:55:51,175
Where was Gondor when
our enemies closed in around us?!

1112
01:55:51,343 --> 01:55:53,220
Where was Gon?

1113
01:55:55,783 --> 01:55:57,614
No, my Lord Aragorn<i>...</i>

1114
01:55:59,143 --> 01:56:01,532
<i>...</i>we are alone.

1115
01:56:08,103 --> 01:56:09,775
Get the women and children
into the caves.

1116
01:56:09,943 --> 01:56:11,137
We need more time
to lay provisions

1117
01:56:11,303 --> 01:56:14,659
There is no time. War is upon us.

1118
01:56:14,943 --> 01:56:16,581
Secure the gate.

1119
01:56:21,543 --> 01:56:23,579
We Ents have not troubled<i>...</i>

1120
01:56:23,783 --> 01:56:26,980
<i>...</i>about the wars of Men and wizards<i>...</i>

1121
01:56:27,743 --> 01:56:30,576
<i>...</i>for a very long time.

1122
01:56:31,783 --> 01:56:36,379
But now, something
is about to happen<i>...</i>

1123
01:56:36,543 --> 01:56:38,773
<i>...</i>that has not happened<i>...</i>

1124
01:56:38,983 --> 01:56:41,338
<i>...</i>for an age.

1125
01:56:42,503 --> 01:56:44,653
Entmoot.

1126
01:56:45,023 --> 01:56:46,012
What's that?

1127
01:56:46,423 --> 01:56:49,142
'Tis a gathering.

1128
01:56:50,303 --> 01:56:52,737
A gathering of what?

1129
01:57:09,943 --> 01:57:12,218
Beech. Oak.

1130
01:57:12,383 --> 01:57:14,180
Chestnut. Ash.

1131
01:57:14,463 --> 01:57:16,340
Good. Good. Good.

1132
01:57:16,503 --> 01:57:18,778
Many have come.

1133
01:57:26,023 --> 01:57:28,662
Now we must decide
if the Ents<i>...</i>

1134
01:57:28,823 --> 01:57:31,291
<i>...</i>will go to war.

1135
01:57:39,863 --> 01:57:42,821
Move back! Move to the caves!

1136
01:57:44,263 --> 01:57:45,855
Keep moving.
Quickly now.

1137
01:58:38,183 --> 01:58:41,334
Farmers, farriers, stable boys.

1138
01:58:42,343 --> 01:58:44,095
These are no soldiers.

1139
01:58:46,023 --> 01:58:49,333
Most have seen too many winters.
Or too few.

1140
01:58:53,103 --> 01:58:55,901
Look at them. They're frightened.

1141
01:58:56,063 --> 01:58:57,462
You can see it in their eyes.

1142
01:59:02,463 --> 01:59:04,135
And they should be<i>...</i>

1143
01:59:04,543 --> 01:59:06,056
Three hundred<i>...</i>

1144
01:59:06,223 --> 01:59:07,451
against ten thousand!

1145
01:59:09,183 --> 01:59:11,697
They have more hope of defending
themselves here than at Edoras<i>...</i>

1146
01:59:12,703 --> 01:59:15,217
They cannot win this fight.

1147
01:59:16,143 --> 01:59:17,371
They are all going to die!

1148
01:59:17,543 --> 01:59:19,613
Then I shall die as one of them!

1149
01:59:25,823 --> 01:59:27,575
Let him go, lad.

1150
01:59:28,103 --> 01:59:30,014
Let him be.

1151
01:59:31,423 --> 01:59:36,656
Every villager able to wield a sword
has been sent to the armoury.

1152
01:59:40,743 --> 01:59:42,574
My lord?

1153
01:59:44,583 --> 01:59:47,017
Who am I, Gamling?

1154
01:59:50,263 --> 01:59:54,017
You are our king, sire.

1155
01:59:56,903 --> 02:00:00,020
And do you trust your king?

1156
02:00:01,503 --> 02:00:04,540
Your men, my lord<i>...</i>

1157
02:00:04,703 --> 02:00:07,376
<i>...</i>will follow you to whatever end.

1158
02:00:13,983 --> 02:00:15,780
To whatever end.

1159
02:00:25,223 --> 02:00:28,659
Where is the horse and the rider?

1160
02:00:28,823 --> 02:00:31,781
Where is the horn that was blowing?

1161
02:00:33,223 --> 02:00:37,455
<i>They have passed Ilke raln</i>
<i>on the mountalns.</i>

1162
02:00:38,423 --> 02:00:41,540
<i>Llke wlnd In the meadow.</i>

1163
02:00:45,063 --> 02:00:48,658
The days have gone down in the West<i>...</i>

1164
02:00:49,343 --> 02:00:51,857
<i>... behlnd the hllls...</i>

1165
02:00:53,703 --> 02:00:55,261
<i>... Into Shadow.</i>

1166
02:01:03,343 --> 02:01:06,653
How did it come to this?

1167
02:01:10,583 --> 02:01:13,416
Move! Move to the outer wall.

1168
02:01:30,263 --> 02:01:31,537
Give me your sword.

1169
02:01:40,623 --> 02:01:41,772
What is your name?

1170
02:01:42,303 --> 02:01:44,578
Haleth, son of Hama, my lord.

1171
02:01:46,623 --> 02:01:49,137
The men are saying
we will not live out the night.

1172
02:01:51,023 --> 02:01:52,900
They say that it is hopeless.

1173
02:02:10,023 --> 02:02:11,581
This is a good sword.

1174
02:02:13,543 --> 02:02:15,773
Haleth, son of Hama<i>...</i>

1175
02:02:19,943 --> 02:02:22,013
<i>...</i>there is always hope.

1176
02:02:44,023 --> 02:02:47,254
We have trusted you this far.
You have not led us astray.

1177
02:02:47,423 --> 02:02:48,902
Forgive me.

1178
02:02:49,063 --> 02:02:50,462
I was wrong to despair.

1179
02:02:53,543 --> 02:02:55,932
There is nothing to forgive, Legolas.

1180
02:02:59,303 --> 02:03:01,976
We had time, I'd get this adjusted.

1181
02:03:05,263 --> 02:03:07,254
It's a little tight across the chest.

1182
02:03:13,183 --> 02:03:15,060
That is no Orc horn.

1183
02:03:20,503 --> 02:03:22,255
Send for the king.

1184
02:03:22,423 --> 02:03:25,859
Open the gate!
Open up the gate!

1185
02:03:56,263 --> 02:03:57,855
How is this possible?

1186
02:03:58,823 --> 02:04:02,293
I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.

1187
02:04:02,463 --> 02:04:05,535
An alliance once existed
between Elves and Men.

1188
02:04:06,223 --> 02:04:10,296
Long ago we fought and died together.

1189
02:04:12,463 --> 02:04:15,261
We come to honor that allegiance.

1190
02:04:23,383 --> 02:04:25,214
You are most welcome.

1191
02:04:30,383 --> 02:04:34,171
We are proud to fight
alongside Men once more.

1192
02:05:06,423 --> 02:05:09,540
You could have picked a better spot.

1193
02:05:14,223 --> 02:05:18,262
Well, lad, whatever luck you live by,
let's hope it lasts the night.

1194
02:05:24,143 --> 02:05:25,861
Your friends are with you, Aragorn.

1195
02:05:26,503 --> 02:05:28,892
Let's hope they last the night.

1196
02:06:26,423 --> 02:06:30,018
Show them no mercy<i>...</i>

1197
02:06:30,943 --> 02:06:33,173
for you shall receive none!

1198
02:07:06,183 --> 02:07:08,856
What's happening out there?
Shall I describe it to you?

1199
02:07:10,063 --> 02:07:11,781
Or would you like me to find you a box?

1200
02:07:49,703 --> 02:07:50,931
HOLD!

1201
02:08:12,423 --> 02:08:14,141
So it begins.

1202
02:08:19,823 --> 02:08:20,892
Prepare to fire!

1203
02:08:29,583 --> 02:08:31,699
Their armour is weak at the neck<i>...</i>

1204
02:08:31,863 --> 02:08:33,376
and beneath the arm.

1205
02:08:33,543 --> 02:08:35,056
Release Arrows!

1206
02:08:39,903 --> 02:08:41,222
Did they hit anything?

1207
02:08:41,863 --> 02:08:43,774
Give them a volley.

1208
02:08:43,943 --> 02:08:45,934
Fire!
Fire!

1209
02:09:01,023 --> 02:09:02,661
Send them to me! Come on!

1210
02:09:21,423 --> 02:09:22,412
Ladders!

1211
02:09:22,583 --> 02:09:23,618
Good!

1212
02:09:30,103 --> 02:09:32,981
Swords! Swords!

1213
02:10:01,783 --> 02:10:03,819
Legolas! Two already!

1214
02:10:03,983 --> 02:10:06,019
I'm on 17!

1215
02:10:06,183 --> 02:10:08,651
I'll have no pointyear outscoring me!

1216
02:10:15,183 --> 02:10:16,855
Nineteen!

1217
02:10:52,583 --> 02:10:53,936
Merry.

1218
02:10:56,423 --> 02:11:00,098
We have just agreed.

1219
02:11:07,783 --> 02:11:09,216
Yes?

1220
02:11:09,703 --> 02:11:13,696
I have told your names to the Entmoot<i>...</i>

1221
02:11:14,783 --> 02:11:17,855
<i>...</i>and we have agreed<i>...</i>

1222
02:11:18,343 --> 02:11:22,177
<i>...</i>you are not Orcs.

1223
02:11:23,063 --> 02:11:25,099
Well, that's good news.

1224
02:11:25,263 --> 02:11:29,222
And what about Saruman?
Have you come to a decision about him?

1225
02:11:29,863 --> 02:11:33,492
Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.

1226
02:11:33,663 --> 02:11:35,142
Hasty?

1227
02:11:35,663 --> 02:11:37,494
Our friends are out there.

1228
02:11:37,663 --> 02:11:41,656
They need our help. They cannot
fight this war on their own.

1229
02:11:41,983 --> 02:11:44,133
War? Yes.

1230
02:11:44,303 --> 02:11:46,134
It affects us all.

1231
02:11:46,903 --> 02:11:50,782
But you must understand, young Hobbit<i>...</i>

1232
02:11:50,983 --> 02:11:52,814
<i>...</i>it takes a long time<i>...</i>

1233
02:11:52,983 --> 02:11:57,693
<i>...</i>to say anything in Old Entish<i>...</i>

1234
02:11:57,863 --> 02:12:01,902
<i>...</i>and we never say anything<i>...</i>

1235
02:12:02,063 --> 02:12:05,817
<i>...</i> unless it is worth taking<i>...</i>

1236
02:12:05,983 --> 02:12:09,862
<i>...</i>a long time to say.

1237
02:12:10,623 --> 02:12:13,820
Seventeen! Eighteen!

1238
02:12:13,983 --> 02:12:14,972
Nineteen!

1239
02:12:15,543 --> 02:12:17,340
Twenty!

1240
02:12:17,503 --> 02:12:19,095
Twentyone!

1241
02:12:28,743 --> 02:12:30,654
Causeway!

1242
02:12:38,143 --> 02:12:40,418
Is this it?

1243
02:12:40,583 --> 02:12:43,381
Is this is all you can conjure, Saruman?

1244
02:13:08,703 --> 02:13:09,931
Bring him down, Legolas!

1245
02:13:13,223 --> 02:13:15,134
Kill him! Kill him!

1246
02:14:05,863 --> 02:14:07,137
Brace the gate!

1247
02:14:24,743 --> 02:14:26,893
Hold them! Stand firm!

1248
02:14:34,463 --> 02:14:35,737
Aragorn!

1249
02:14:40,183 --> 02:14:41,332
Gimli!

1250
02:14:51,623 --> 02:14:53,215
Charge!

1251
02:15:27,783 --> 02:15:31,571
The Ents cannot hold back this storm.

1252
02:15:32,303 --> 02:15:36,182
We must weather such things
as we have always done.

1253
02:15:36,943 --> 02:15:38,979
How can that be your decision?!

1254
02:15:39,623 --> 02:15:43,093
This is not our war.

1255
02:15:43,383 --> 02:15:45,499
But you're part of this world!

1256
02:15:49,463 --> 02:15:51,215
Aren't you?!

1257
02:15:55,143 --> 02:15:57,373
You must help. Please.

1258
02:15:58,663 --> 02:16:01,302
You must do something.

1259
02:16:01,543 --> 02:16:05,695
You are young and brave, Master Merry.

1260
02:16:06,823 --> 02:16:10,418
But your part in this tale is over.

1261
02:16:10,583 --> 02:16:12,733
Go back to your home.

1262
02:16:22,343 --> 02:16:24,493
Maybe Treebeard's right.

1263
02:16:24,663 --> 02:16:26,460
We don't belong here, Merry.

1264
02:16:26,623 --> 02:16:28,773
It's too big for us.

1265
02:16:28,943 --> 02:16:31,503
What can we do in the end?

1266
02:16:33,703 --> 02:16:36,263
We've got the Shire.

1267
02:16:36,743 --> 02:16:39,177
Maybe we should go home.

1268
02:16:40,943 --> 02:16:44,060
The fires of Isengard will spread<i>...</i>

1269
02:16:44,223 --> 02:16:48,899
<i>...</i>and the woods of Tuckborough
and Buckland will burn.

1270
02:16:49,063 --> 02:16:50,621
And<i>...</i>

1271
02:16:52,343 --> 02:16:55,301
And all that was once green and good
in this world will be gone.

1272
02:16:58,663 --> 02:17:01,496
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.

1273
02:17:20,223 --> 02:17:21,372
Aragorn!

1274
02:17:21,543 --> 02:17:23,818
Fall back to the Keep!

1275
02:17:23,983 --> 02:17:26,975
Get your men out of there!

1276
02:17:28,063 --> 02:17:29,542
To the Keep!

1277
02:17:34,143 --> 02:17:35,656
Pull back to the Keep!

1278
02:17:36,223 --> 02:17:37,815
Haldir!

1279
02:17:38,543 --> 02:17:39,942
To the Keep!

1280
02:17:41,743 --> 02:17:44,894
What are you doing?
What are you stopping for?

1281
02:18:03,303 --> 02:18:04,497
Haldir!

1282
02:18:43,583 --> 02:18:45,016
Brace the gate!

1283
02:18:47,783 --> 02:18:49,057
Hold them!

1284
02:18:50,823 --> 02:18:54,020
To the gate. Draw your swords!

1285
02:19:16,903 --> 02:19:18,780
Make way!

1286
02:19:21,543 --> 02:19:23,215
We cannot hold much longer!

1287
02:19:28,943 --> 02:19:32,379
Hold them!
How long do you need?

1288
02:19:32,543 --> 02:19:34,977
As long as you can give me.

1289
02:19:35,143 --> 02:19:36,735
Gimli!

1290
02:19:38,183 --> 02:19:39,457
Timbers!

1291
02:19:39,623 --> 02:19:41,534
Brace the gate!

1292
02:19:55,703 --> 02:19:57,341
Come on. We can take them.

1293
02:19:58,143 --> 02:19:59,701
It's a long way.

1294
02:20:04,743 --> 02:20:06,415
Toss me.

1295
02:20:07,543 --> 02:20:09,295
What?
I cannot jump the distance!

1296
02:20:09,463 --> 02:20:10,976
You'll have to toss me!

1297
02:20:16,343 --> 02:20:17,537
Don't tell the Elf.

1298
02:20:18,063 --> 02:20:19,781
Not a word.

1299
02:20:34,383 --> 02:20:35,782
Shore up the door!

1300
02:20:35,943 --> 02:20:37,934
Make way!
Follow me to the barricade.

1301
02:20:38,103 --> 02:20:39,138
Watch our backs!

1302
02:20:43,103 --> 02:20:45,219
Throw another one over here!
Higher!

1303
02:21:33,143 --> 02:21:34,496
Hold fast the gate!

1304
02:21:38,543 --> 02:21:41,376
Gimli! Aragorn!
Get out of there!

1305
02:21:45,903 --> 02:21:47,461
Aragorn!

1306
02:22:19,503 --> 02:22:21,858
Pull everybody back.

1307
02:22:22,183 --> 02:22:23,935
Pull them back.

1308
02:22:24,423 --> 02:22:25,856
Fall back!

1309
02:22:26,023 --> 02:22:28,412
Fall back!

1310
02:22:29,543 --> 02:22:31,135
They have broken through!

1311
02:22:31,303 --> 02:22:33,498
The castle is breached. Retreat!

1312
02:22:33,663 --> 02:22:35,779
Fall back!
Retreat!

1313
02:22:35,943 --> 02:22:38,457
Hurry! I nside. Get them inside!

1314
02:22:38,623 --> 02:22:40,773
I nto the Keep!

1315
02:22:51,783 --> 02:22:56,538
I will leave you at the western borders
of the forest.

1316
02:22:56,703 --> 02:23:01,219
You can make your way north
to your homeland from there.

1317
02:23:06,703 --> 02:23:07,931
Wait! Stop!

1318
02:23:08,783 --> 02:23:10,216
Stop!

1319
02:23:13,223 --> 02:23:14,861
Turn around.

1320
02:23:15,743 --> 02:23:18,337
Turn around. Take us south.
South?

1321
02:23:18,503 --> 02:23:23,293
But that will lead you past Isengard.

1322
02:23:23,623 --> 02:23:26,183
Yes. Exactly.

1323
02:23:26,343 --> 02:23:29,460
If we go south, we can slip
past Saruman unnoticed.

1324
02:23:29,623 --> 02:23:32,183
The closer we are to danger,
the farther we are from harm.

1325
02:23:32,343 --> 02:23:34,254
It's the last thing he'll expect.

1326
02:23:36,743 --> 02:23:39,655
That doesn't make sense to me.

1327
02:23:39,823 --> 02:23:40,938
But then<i>...</i>

1328
02:23:41,103 --> 02:23:43,697
<i>...</i>you are very small.

1329
02:23:43,863 --> 02:23:45,535
Perhaps you're right.

1330
02:23:48,103 --> 02:23:49,536
South it is, then.

1331
02:23:50,983 --> 02:23:54,180
Hold on, little Shirelings.

1332
02:23:56,143 --> 02:23:58,816
I always like going south.

1333
02:23:58,983 --> 02:24:03,101
Somehow it feels like going downhill.

1334
02:24:03,663 --> 02:24:06,018
Are you mad? We'll be caught.

1335
02:24:06,183 --> 02:24:08,060
No, we won't.

1336
02:24:08,743 --> 02:24:10,938
Not this time.

1337
02:24:17,303 --> 02:24:18,292
Look!

1338
02:24:19,863 --> 02:24:22,172
Osgiliath burns!

1339
02:24:22,343 --> 02:24:23,742
Mordor has come.

1340
02:24:24,823 --> 02:24:27,132
The Ring will not save Gondor.

1341
02:24:28,423 --> 02:24:30,493
It has only the power to destroy.

1342
02:24:31,383 --> 02:24:32,736
Please<i>...</i>

1343
02:24:32,903 --> 02:24:34,495
<i>...</i>let me go.

1344
02:24:35,463 --> 02:24:37,021
Hurry.

1345
02:24:40,343 --> 02:24:41,696
Faramir!

1346
02:24:41,863 --> 02:24:44,252
You must let me go!

1347
02:24:45,103 --> 02:24:47,936
And those little family of field mice<i>...</i>

1348
02:24:48,103 --> 02:24:50,822
<i>...</i>that climb up sometimes,
and they tickle me awfully.

1349
02:24:51,543 --> 02:24:54,694
They're always trying to get somewhere
where they<i>...</i>

1350
02:25:05,423 --> 02:25:08,256
Many of these trees were my friends.

1351
02:25:08,903 --> 02:25:13,374
Creatures I had known
from nut and acorn.

1352
02:25:14,503 --> 02:25:15,618
I'm sorry, Treebeard.

1353
02:25:15,783 --> 02:25:18,456
They had voices of their own.

1354
02:25:20,583 --> 02:25:23,051
Saruman.

1355
02:25:23,383 --> 02:25:26,341
A wizard should know better!

1356
02:25:40,023 --> 02:25:43,493
There is no curse in Elvish<i>...</i>

1357
02:25:43,703 --> 02:25:46,263
<i>...</i> Entish or the tongues of Men<i>...</i>

1358
02:25:46,423 --> 02:25:48,653
<i>...</i>for this treachery.

1359
02:25:49,703 --> 02:25:53,821
My business is with Isengard tonight<i>...</i>

1360
02:25:53,983 --> 02:25:56,497
<i>...</i>with rock and stone.

1361
02:26:19,463 --> 02:26:20,532
Yes.

1362
02:26:21,583 --> 02:26:22,982
Come, my friends.

1363
02:26:24,263 --> 02:26:28,256
The Ents are going to war.

1364
02:26:28,423 --> 02:26:30,141
It is likely<i>...</i>

1365
02:26:30,303 --> 02:26:33,693
<i>...</i>that we go to our doom.

1366
02:26:35,023 --> 02:26:37,378
Last march<i>...</i>

1367
02:26:37,903 --> 02:26:39,859
<i>...</i>of the Ents.

1368
02:27:26,023 --> 02:27:29,572
Faramir! Orcs have taken the eastern
shore. Their numbers are too great.

1369
02:27:29,743 --> 02:27:31,734
By nightfall we will be overrun.

1370
02:27:34,383 --> 02:27:35,782
Mr. Frodo?

1371
02:27:36,103 --> 02:27:40,016
It's calling to him, Sam.
His Eye is almost on me.

1372
02:27:40,183 --> 02:27:42,572
Hold on, Mr. Frodo.
You'll be all right.

1373
02:27:56,303 --> 02:27:57,656
Take them to my father.

1374
02:27:59,143 --> 02:28:02,021
Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.

1375
02:28:04,343 --> 02:28:07,255
A weapon that will change our fortunes
in this war.

1376
02:28:08,383 --> 02:28:10,977
Do you want to know
what happened to Boromir?

1377
02:28:11,583 --> 02:28:14,222
You want to know
why your brother died?

1378
02:28:14,663 --> 02:28:18,258
He tried to take the Ring from Frodo
after swearing an oath to protect him!

1379
02:28:18,423 --> 02:28:20,254
He tried to kill him!

1380
02:28:20,423 --> 02:28:22,653
The Ring drove your brother mad!

1381
02:28:23,383 --> 02:28:25,180
Watch out!

1382
02:28:35,623 --> 02:28:36,738
Mr. Frodo?

1383
02:28:39,263 --> 02:28:41,015
They're here.

1384
02:28:43,983 --> 02:28:46,338
They've come.

1385
02:28:48,823 --> 02:28:50,654
Nazgûl!

1386
02:29:11,863 --> 02:29:13,933
Stay here. Keep out of sight.

1387
02:29:15,663 --> 02:29:17,813
Take cover!

1388
02:29:34,423 --> 02:29:35,936
The fortress is taken.

1389
02:29:36,663 --> 02:29:37,812
It is over.

1390
02:29:37,983 --> 02:29:41,737
You said this fortress would never fall
while your men defend it.

1391
02:29:41,903 --> 02:29:44,736
They still defend it.
They have died defending it.

1392
02:29:47,343 --> 02:29:48,696
They're breaking in!

1393
02:29:51,223 --> 02:29:53,612
They're past the door!

1394
02:29:56,823 --> 02:30:00,782
Is there no other way for the women
and children to get out of the caves?

1395
02:30:03,343 --> 02:30:05,220
Is there no other way?

1396
02:30:06,703 --> 02:30:09,661
There is one passage.
It leads into the mountains.

1397
02:30:10,303 --> 02:30:12,419
But they will not get far.
The Urukhai are too many.

1398
02:30:17,063 --> 02:30:19,372
Tell the women and children
to make for the mountain pass.

1399
02:30:19,543 --> 02:30:22,296
And barricade the entrance!
So much death.

1400
02:30:24,383 --> 02:30:27,614
What can Men do
against such reckless hate?

1401
02:30:32,103 --> 02:30:33,502
Ride out with me.

1402
02:30:37,423 --> 02:30:38,981
Ride out and meet them.

1403
02:30:39,743 --> 02:30:41,813
For death and glory.

1404
02:30:41,983 --> 02:30:43,302
For Rohan.

1405
02:30:44,743 --> 02:30:46,176
For your people.

1406
02:30:46,863 --> 02:30:48,740
The sun is rising.

1407
02:30:53,063 --> 02:30:55,941
<i>Look to my comlng at flrst Ilght</i>
<i>on the flfth day.</i>

1408
02:30:56,103 --> 02:30:57,422
<i>At dawn...</i>

1409
02:30:57,583 --> 02:30:59,221
<i>... look to the east.</i>

1410
02:31:03,263 --> 02:31:04,821
Yes.

1411
02:31:07,183 --> 02:31:08,775
Yes.

1412
02:31:10,063 --> 02:31:12,372
The horn of Helm Hammerhand<i>...</i>

1413
02:31:12,543 --> 02:31:15,216
<i>...</i>shall sound in the Deep<i>...</i>

1414
02:31:15,623 --> 02:31:17,534
<i>...</i>one last time.

1415
02:31:17,703 --> 02:31:19,136
Yes!

1416
02:31:22,063 --> 02:31:25,692
Let this be the hour
when we draw swords together.

1417
02:31:33,183 --> 02:31:34,457
Fell deeds, awake.

1418
02:31:35,623 --> 02:31:36,658
Now for wrath<i>...</i>

1419
02:31:36,823 --> 02:31:40,099
<i>...</i> now for ruin and a red dawn.

1420
02:31:46,823 --> 02:31:49,018
Forth Eorlingas!

1421
02:32:34,823 --> 02:32:36,017
Gandalf.

1422
02:32:42,983 --> 02:32:46,498
Théoden King stands alone.

1423
02:32:47,103 --> 02:32:49,173
Not alone.

1424
02:32:49,543 --> 02:32:50,658
Rohirrim!

1425
02:32:56,303 --> 02:32:57,418
Eomer.

1426
02:32:57,583 --> 02:33:00,017
To the king!

1427
02:34:14,463 --> 02:34:16,135
Yes!

1428
02:34:24,903 --> 02:34:28,213
A hit. A fine hit.

1429
02:34:51,783 --> 02:34:54,138
Break the dam!

1430
02:34:54,303 --> 02:34:57,579
Release the river!

1431
02:35:23,783 --> 02:35:26,422
Pippin! Hold on!

1432
02:35:31,463 --> 02:35:34,296
Hold on, little Hobbits.

1433
02:36:13,943 --> 02:36:15,899
What are you doing?

1434
02:36:24,103 --> 02:36:25,616
Where are you going?

1435
02:37:21,383 --> 02:37:22,657
It's me.

1436
02:37:25,063 --> 02:37:27,179
It's your Sam.

1437
02:37:31,343 --> 02:37:33,857
Don't you know your Sam?

1438
02:37:50,863 --> 02:37:54,094
I can't do this, Sam.

1439
02:37:54,983 --> 02:37:56,894
I know.

1440
02:37:57,863 --> 02:38:00,093
It's all wrong.

1441
02:38:00,823 --> 02:38:02,779
By rights, we shouldn't even be here.

1442
02:38:09,863 --> 02:38:11,899
But we are.

1443
02:38:18,023 --> 02:38:20,935
It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.

1444
02:38:21,103 --> 02:38:23,412
The ones that really mattered.

1445
02:38:24,423 --> 02:38:27,301
Full of darkness and danger they were.

1446
02:38:27,463 --> 02:38:30,296
And sometimes you didn't want
to know the end<i>...</i>

1447
02:38:30,463 --> 02:38:33,261
<i>...</i>because how could the end be happy?

1448
02:38:35,743 --> 02:38:37,859
<i>How could the world go back</i>
<i>to the way It was...</i>

1449
02:38:38,023 --> 02:38:39,900
<i>... when so much bad had happened?</i>

1450
02:38:40,463 --> 02:38:42,613
Victory!

1451
02:38:42,783 --> 02:38:45,013
We have victory!

1452
02:38:46,663 --> 02:38:50,576
<i>But In the end,</i>
<i>It's only a passlng thlng...</i>

1453
02:38:50,743 --> 02:38:52,096
<i>... thls shadow.</i>

1454
02:38:52,263 --> 02:38:55,221
<i>Even darkness must pass.</i>

1455
02:38:55,383 --> 02:38:57,692
<i>A new day wlll come.</i>

1456
02:38:58,543 --> 02:39:02,661
<i>And when the sun shlnes,</i>
<i>It wlll shlne out the clearer.</i>

1457
02:39:04,263 --> 02:39:06,538
<i>Those were the storles</i>
<i>that stayed wlth you...</i>

1458
02:39:06,703 --> 02:39:08,261
<i>... that meant somethlng.</i>

1459
02:39:08,423 --> 02:39:11,256
<i>Even If you were too small</i>
<i>to understand why.</i>

1460
02:39:12,143 --> 02:39:15,818
<i>But I thlnk, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.</i>

1461
02:39:15,983 --> 02:39:17,621
<i>I know now.</i>

1462
02:39:18,503 --> 02:39:20,619
Folk in those stories<i>...</i>

1463
02:39:20,783 --> 02:39:24,742
<i>...</i> had lots of chances of turning back,
only they didn't.

1464
02:39:24,903 --> 02:39:27,053
They kept going<i>...</i>

1465
02:39:27,703 --> 02:39:30,820
<i>...</i>because they were holding
on to something.

1466
02:39:32,383 --> 02:39:34,578
What are we holding on to, Sam?

1467
02:39:46,023 --> 02:39:49,811
That there's some good
in this world, Mr. Frodo.

1468
02:39:49,983 --> 02:39:52,497
And it's worth fighting for.

1469
02:40:18,303 --> 02:40:22,421
I think at last we understand one another,
Frodo Baggins.

1470
02:40:23,143 --> 02:40:26,931
You know the laws of our country,
the laws of your father.

1471
02:40:27,103 --> 02:40:29,219
If you let them go,
your life will be forfeit.

1472
02:40:33,383 --> 02:40:34,736
Then it is forfeit.

1473
02:40:37,383 --> 02:40:39,101
Release them.

1474
02:40:49,223 --> 02:40:54,172
Sauron's wrath will be terrible,
his retribution swift.

1475
02:41:01,063 --> 02:41:03,941
The battle for Helm's Deep is over.

1476
02:41:04,583 --> 02:41:07,939
The battle for Middleearth
is about to begin.

1477
02:41:12,903 --> 02:41:16,179
All our hopes now lie
with two little Hobbits<i>...</i>

1478
02:41:17,103 --> 02:41:20,220
<i>... somewhere In the wllderness.</i>

1479
02:41:23,383 --> 02:41:26,659
I wonder if we'll ever be
put into songs or tales.

1480
02:41:26,823 --> 02:41:28,097
What?

1481
02:41:28,263 --> 02:41:32,097
I wonder if people will ever say,
"Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring."

1482
02:41:32,263 --> 02:41:35,380
And they'll say,
"Yes! That's one of my favorite stories."

1483
02:41:35,543 --> 02:41:38,341
"Frodo was really courageous,
wasn't he, Dad?"

1484
02:41:38,503 --> 02:41:40,095
"Yes, my boy.

1485
02:41:40,263 --> 02:41:43,938
The most famousest of Hobbits.
And that's saying a lot."

1486
02:41:44,103 --> 02:41:46,492
Well, you've left out
one of the chief characters:

1487
02:41:46,663 --> 02:41:48,494
"Samwise the Brave."

1488
02:41:48,663 --> 02:41:51,302
I want to hear more about Sam.

1489
02:41:55,423 --> 02:41:58,301
Frodo wouldn't have got far
without Sam.

1490
02:41:59,583 --> 02:42:03,462
Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun.
I was being serious.

1491
02:42:04,503 --> 02:42:05,822
So was I.

1492
02:42:14,343 --> 02:42:16,903
"Samwise the Brave."

1493
02:42:21,023 --> 02:42:22,297
Sméagol?

1494
02:42:22,463 --> 02:42:25,216
We're not going to wait for you.
Come on.

1495
02:42:25,383 --> 02:42:27,260
Master.

1496
02:42:27,423 --> 02:42:30,256
Master looks after us.

1497
02:42:30,983 --> 02:42:33,702
Master wouldn't hurt us.

1498
02:42:33,863 --> 02:42:36,218
Master broke his promise.

1499
02:42:36,383 --> 02:42:38,453
Don't ask Sméagol.

1500
02:42:38,623 --> 02:42:41,695
Poor, poor Sméagol.

1501
02:42:41,863 --> 02:42:44,582
Master betrayed us.

1502
02:42:44,743 --> 02:42:47,701
Wicked. Tricksy. False.

1503
02:42:47,863 --> 02:42:51,617
We ought to wring
his filthy little neck.

1504
02:42:51,783 --> 02:42:54,377
Kill him! Kill him!

1505
02:42:54,543 --> 02:42:55,976
Kill them both!

1506
02:42:56,143 --> 02:42:59,613
And then we take the precious<i>...</i>

1507
02:42:59,783 --> 02:43:03,173
<i>...</i>and we be the master!

1508
02:43:03,823 --> 02:43:06,383
But the fat Hobbit, he knows.

1509
02:43:06,543 --> 02:43:09,103
Eyes always watching.

1510
02:43:09,263 --> 02:43:12,699
Then we stabs them out.

1511
02:43:12,863 --> 02:43:17,175
Put out his eyeses
and make him crawl.

1512
02:43:17,343 --> 02:43:20,653
Yes. Yes. Yes.

1513
02:43:20,823 --> 02:43:23,417
Kill them both.

1514
02:43:23,583 --> 02:43:25,972
Yes. No! No!

1515
02:43:26,143 --> 02:43:29,692
It's too risky. It's too risky.

1516
02:43:30,343 --> 02:43:32,857
Where is he? Where has he gone?

1517
02:43:33,023 --> 02:43:35,491
Hey, Gollum! Where are you?
Sméagol?

1518
02:43:35,663 --> 02:43:40,862
We could let her do it.

1519
02:43:41,783 --> 02:43:45,742
Yes. She could do it.

1520
02:43:45,903 --> 02:43:50,294
Yes, precious, she could.

1521
02:43:50,463 --> 02:43:56,254
And then we takes it
once they're dead.

1522
02:43:57,143 --> 02:43:59,862
Once they're dead.

1523
02:44:04,103 --> 02:44:07,618
Come on, Hobbits. Long ways to go yet.

1524
02:44:07,783 --> 02:44:09,774
Sméagol will show you the way.

1525
02:44:09,943 --> 02:44:12,093
Follow me.

1526
02:51:56,103 --> 02:51:57,092
Subtitles : Filou ;-)
