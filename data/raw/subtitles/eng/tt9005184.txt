1
00:01:39,429 --> 00:01:40,700
Ooh.

2
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,445
Fuck.

3
00:02:17,794 --> 00:02:18,929
Uhh!

4
00:02:34,102 --> 00:02:35,070
Unh!

5
00:02:35,104 --> 00:02:37,042
Ahh!

6
00:02:41,988 --> 00:02:43,524
Fuck!

7
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:51,111
Ah, fuck!

8
00:03:11,695 --> 00:03:13,767
Ah! Ahh!

9
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:04,026
<i>Well done, you...</i>

10
00:04:05,827 --> 00:04:07,762
<i>Well done. You're the winner.</i>

11
00:04:07,964 --> 00:04:10,799
<i>Remind me. Are you the original
or the double?</i>

12
00:04:14,836 --> 00:04:15,905
<i>The double.</i>

13
00:04:16,973 --> 00:04:19,308
<i>Of course.
I always get mixed up.</i>

14
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:22,744
<i>Obviously it gets confusing
when you both look identical.</i>

15
00:04:23,112 --> 00:04:25,214
<i>Excellent work negating
his ranged attack</i>

16
00:04:25,248 --> 00:04:26,983
<i>and closing the distance.</i>

17
00:04:30,086 --> 00:04:31,254
<i>Thank you.</i>

18
00:04:33,256 --> 00:04:35,191
<i>The double has won the duel.</i>

19
00:04:35,824 --> 00:04:37,326
<i>He's Robert Michaels now.</i>

20
00:04:56,245 --> 00:04:58,247
<i>Can I take your order?</i>

21
00:04:58,281 --> 00:05:00,917
Yes, I'll have
one two-layer taco,

22
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:03,085
two soft tacos,

23
00:05:03,119 --> 00:05:05,922
a double burrito,
and an order of nachos.

24
00:05:05,955 --> 00:05:07,223
<i>WHICH ONE?</i>

25
00:05:07,256 --> 00:05:08,891
<i>We have several kinds of nachos.</i>

26
00:05:08,925 --> 00:05:10,993
The one that's just
the chips and cheese dip.

27
00:05:11,027 --> 00:05:13,062
<i>How many drinks for this order?</i>

28
00:05:13,095 --> 00:05:14,796
Only one.

29
00:05:42,023 --> 00:05:43,992
<i>I don't know. It's haunted.</i>

30
00:05:44,259 --> 00:05:46,228
<i>But look, there's a pool.</i>

31
00:05:50,065 --> 00:05:51,900
<i>Yeah, yeah!</i>

32
00:05:51,933 --> 00:05:53,301
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

33
00:06:21,329 --> 00:06:23,064
Well, hello.

34
00:06:23,098 --> 00:06:25,233
<i>Hey, sweetheart.
What are you up to?</i>

35
00:06:25,267 --> 00:06:26,968
Just watching television.

36
00:06:27,002 --> 00:06:28,203
<i>What are you watching?</i>

37
00:06:31,206 --> 00:06:34,009
A reality competition
show about dating.

38
00:06:34,042 --> 00:06:35,944
<i>That doesn't sound very good.</i>

39
00:06:35,977 --> 00:06:38,446
It isn't very good, but
I consider it a guilty pleasure.

40
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,248
What are you doing?

41
00:06:40,282 --> 00:06:42,917
<i>I took my team out
for drinks after work tonight.</i>

42
00:06:42,951 --> 00:06:45,186
<i>They've been doing such
a great job on this project.</i>

43
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:46,955
What about
that co-worker of yours

44
00:06:46,988 --> 00:06:49,057
you were telling me about? Sam?

45
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:51,059
Is he still struggling
with the workload?

46
00:06:51,092 --> 00:06:53,928
<i>Actually, Sam's doing
tremendous now.</i>

47
00:06:53,962 --> 00:06:55,930
Oh. Oh, that's good, I guess.

48
00:06:55,964 --> 00:06:57,966
<i>In fact, I'm even
considering giving him</i>

49
00:06:57,999 --> 00:06:59,434
<i>a most-improved award.</i>

50
00:06:59,467 --> 00:07:01,148
<i>Awards in the workplace
have been proven...</i>

51
00:07:06,241 --> 00:07:07,942
<i>increase morale even if it-if...</i>

52
00:07:07,976 --> 00:07:09,911
<i>it d-d-d...
Really mean anything.</i>

53
00:07:13,281 --> 00:07:14,949
I miss you.

54
00:07:16,384 --> 00:07:18,219
<i>I miss you, too, sweetheart.</i>

55
00:07:19,254 --> 00:07:21,289
<i>Maybe I'll call you
one more time before bed?</i>

56
00:07:21,323 --> 00:07:22,991
No, that's okay.

57
00:07:23,024 --> 00:07:24,993
I actually think I'm going
to go to bed soon, too.

58
00:07:25,026 --> 00:07:27,028
<i>Really? It's so early there.</i>

59
00:07:27,062 --> 00:07:28,363
Yes, but I'm tired.

60
00:07:33,001 --> 00:07:35,170
<i>All right, well, you should
definitely get some rest,</i>

61
00:07:35,203 --> 00:07:36,471
<i>and we can talk tomorrow.</i>

62
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:40,141
I'll text you when I wake up.

63
00:07:40,175 --> 00:07:42,143
<i>All right. Good night, Sarah.</i>

64
00:07:59,561 --> 00:08:03,264
<i>Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!</i>

65
00:08:03,298 --> 00:08:05,233
Sarah, dear,
are you really hungry?

66
00:08:05,266 --> 00:08:07,001
Or are you putting food
into your mouth

67
00:08:07,035 --> 00:08:08,503
so you don't have to talk to me?

68
00:08:09,304 --> 00:08:11,306
I'm just a normal
amount of hungry.

69
00:08:12,006 --> 00:08:14,476
It's possible to eat and have
a conversation at the same time.

70
00:08:16,444 --> 00:08:18,279
- I think I'm going to be...
- Sarah...

71
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,322
I think I'm going to be
late for work.

72
00:08:28,355 --> 00:08:31,525
You don't have work today.
That's why you're here with me.

73
00:08:31,558 --> 00:08:33,460
What day is it?

74
00:08:33,494 --> 00:08:35,429
Do you remember these?

75
00:08:35,462 --> 00:08:37,264
My penny collection?

76
00:08:37,297 --> 00:08:39,099
Why did you stop collecting?

77
00:08:39,533 --> 00:08:41,969
I was 10, I took
on other hobbies.

78
00:08:42,002 --> 00:08:43,103
Where did you find these?

79
00:08:43,137 --> 00:08:44,972
Why aren't you happy anymore?

80
00:08:46,473 --> 00:08:47,975
I am happy.

81
00:08:48,008 --> 00:08:49,476
Why don't you answer my calls?

82
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:58,085
Why don't you visit me?

83
00:09:01,255 --> 00:09:02,523
Don't you love me?

84
00:09:23,477 --> 00:09:25,012
Goodbye, Sarah.

85
00:10:43,257 --> 00:10:47,327
Ma'am, I said, is it
an emergency, or can you wait?

86
00:10:49,329 --> 00:10:51,164
No, it's not an emergency.

87
00:10:52,566 --> 00:10:56,169
Fill out as much of this form
as you can, initial this,

88
00:10:56,203 --> 00:10:57,964
and the yellow page
gives us permission to...

89
00:11:03,744 --> 00:11:06,647
Ma'am, I thought you said
this wasn't an emergency.

90
00:11:11,251 --> 00:11:12,719
<i>How are you feeling?</i>

91
00:11:12,753 --> 00:11:15,589
I'm feeling okay.
I haven't had any more episodes.

92
00:11:15,622 --> 00:11:17,457
<i>That's good news.</i>

93
00:11:17,491 --> 00:11:20,394
<i>Does this mean
you'll be coming home early?</i>

94
00:11:21,227 --> 00:11:23,162
<i>You know I can't
do that, sweetheart.</i>

95
00:11:23,496 --> 00:11:26,165
<i>We're at a very critical stage
of the project.</i>

96
00:11:26,599 --> 00:11:29,335
No, I know. I just
thought you might be able to...

97
00:11:29,368 --> 00:11:31,170
step away for a moment.

98
00:11:31,203 --> 00:11:32,638
<i>Perhaps.</i>

99
00:11:32,672 --> 00:11:34,640
<i>I need to figure
some things out here first.</i>

100
00:11:35,341 --> 00:11:36,776
I understand.

101
00:11:38,778 --> 00:11:41,213
<i>Hey, what did
the gastroenterologist say?</i>

102
00:11:41,647 --> 00:11:43,482
She's still running tests.

103
00:11:43,749 --> 00:11:45,618
Everyone is having
a hard time believing me

104
00:11:45,651 --> 00:11:48,387
that there were no signs
or symptoms leading up to this.

105
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,358
Who was that?

106
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:54,293
<i>Aw, nothing. It was just...</i>

107
00:11:54,327 --> 00:11:56,395
<i>Sam texted me
that he got home safely.</i>

108
00:11:56,662 --> 00:11:58,564
You went out with
your co-workers tonight?

109
00:11:59,265 --> 00:12:00,666
<i>No, no, no. Just Sam.</i>

110
00:12:01,534 --> 00:12:03,402
<i>He accidentally drank
too much, though.</i>

111
00:12:03,436 --> 00:12:05,371
<i>I sent him home in a taxi.</i>

112
00:12:06,505 --> 00:12:08,307
<i>What are you up to tonight?</i>

113
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:13,245
I'm in the hospital.

114
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,815
<i>Right, right... I mean...</i>

115
00:12:16,816 --> 00:12:18,751
<i>Do you think you can
go to bed soon?</i>

116
00:12:19,852 --> 00:12:21,520
Yes, I probably should.

117
00:12:21,554 --> 00:12:24,290
I'm supposed to get
an endoscopy tomorrow morning.

118
00:12:24,323 --> 00:12:25,791
I forgot to tell you about that.

119
00:12:27,326 --> 00:12:29,304
They didn't let me eat
or drink anything for dinner,

120
00:12:29,328 --> 00:12:31,330
so I'm quite hungry and thirsty.

121
00:12:31,364 --> 00:12:33,845
You can probably hear my stomach
growling louder than my voice.

122
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:38,871
<i>Mm. Mm.</i>

123
00:12:38,905 --> 00:12:41,207
<i>That's good.
You should get some sleep.</i>

124
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,242
Oh, okay.

125
00:12:43,275 --> 00:12:44,677
<i>Good night, sweetheart.</i>

126
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:46,545
Good night, Peter.

127
00:12:52,585 --> 00:12:54,520
We're sending you home.

128
00:12:55,521 --> 00:12:57,256
So there's nothing
wrong with me?

129
00:12:57,289 --> 00:13:00,393
No, there most definitely
is something wrong with you,

130
00:13:00,426 --> 00:13:02,561
but while we wait
for the current round of tests

131
00:13:02,595 --> 00:13:05,631
to come back,
there's nothing more to be done.

132
00:13:05,865 --> 00:13:09,769
You'd be better off being around
your family and friends.

133
00:13:10,469 --> 00:13:11,804
I haven't told my mom yet.

134
00:13:11,837 --> 00:13:13,572
I wanted to wait until
I had a better idea

135
00:13:13,606 --> 00:13:14,840
of what was happening.

136
00:13:14,874 --> 00:13:16,575
I feel much better, actually.

137
00:13:16,609 --> 00:13:18,377
Maybe I'm getting better.

138
00:13:18,411 --> 00:13:21,280
Sarah, listen very carefully.

139
00:13:21,313 --> 00:13:23,616
We may be in the dark here
on what exactly

140
00:13:23,649 --> 00:13:26,786
is happening inside of you,
but whatever it is,

141
00:13:26,819 --> 00:13:28,688
it's very serious.

142
00:13:29,422 --> 00:13:31,757
When you go home,
you need to rest.

143
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:33,759
You need to take
care of yourself.

144
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:36,662
You need to not drink.

145
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:38,899
Do you understand?

146
00:13:40,633 --> 00:13:41,834
I understand.

147
00:13:43,369 --> 00:13:44,837
<i>Very good.</i>

148
00:13:47,373 --> 00:13:49,809
<i>That's very, very good.</i>

149
00:14:28,646 --> 00:14:30,515
<i>Hey, it's Peter.
Leave a message.</i>

150
00:15:37,482 --> 00:15:38,750
<i>Hey, sweetheart.</i>

151
00:15:38,783 --> 00:15:40,451
Guess what I just did?

152
00:15:40,485 --> 00:15:41,853
<i>I'm not sure. Tell me.</i>

153
00:15:41,887 --> 00:15:43,655
I just went to the gym.

154
00:15:43,688 --> 00:15:45,867
The doctor told me to rest,
but I woke up feeling energized,

155
00:15:45,891 --> 00:15:47,692
and so I decided
to go and work out,

156
00:15:47,725 --> 00:15:49,794
and I got very sweaty and hot,

157
00:15:49,828 --> 00:15:51,629
so the second I walked
through the door,

158
00:15:51,663 --> 00:15:53,598
I took off all my clothes.

159
00:15:58,503 --> 00:16:00,906
I actually feel a lot better
than I have in a long time.

160
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:03,842
I don't think I'm sick anymore.
It was probably just a cold.

161
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:05,153
I looked up the symptoms online,

162
00:16:05,177 --> 00:16:07,345
and that was one of
the possibilities.

163
00:16:07,913 --> 00:16:09,048
What's wrong?

164
00:16:13,518 --> 00:16:17,056
<i>You... You have a rare
condition, and it's terminal.</i>

165
00:16:17,789 --> 00:16:20,725
You're just imagining the worst.
I'm fine, I promise.

166
00:16:21,093 --> 00:16:22,928
<i>You accidentally
put my number down</i>

167
00:16:22,962 --> 00:16:25,830
<i>on the primary contact
instead of emergency contacts,</i>

168
00:16:25,864 --> 00:16:27,765
<i>so your doctor's
been calling me,</i>

169
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:29,834
<i>but I assumed it was
a telemarketer,</i>

170
00:16:29,868 --> 00:16:31,736
<i>so I didn't answer.</i>

171
00:16:31,769 --> 00:16:33,906
<i>She must have assumed that
you're screening your calls</i>

172
00:16:33,939 --> 00:16:36,909
<i>because she left a very
detailed voicemail in my in box.</i>

173
00:16:42,882 --> 00:16:44,950
You're telling me
this on video chat?

174
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:47,652
<i>I know. I'm sorry.</i>

175
00:16:50,089 --> 00:16:51,991
How long have you known?

176
00:16:53,959 --> 00:16:57,029
<i>Two days.
I didn't know how to tell you.</i>

177
00:17:00,698 --> 00:17:02,667
<i>Sarah, you're going to die.</i>

178
00:17:09,108 --> 00:17:11,010
Why aren't I crying?

179
00:17:17,581 --> 00:17:20,051
I apologize for the voicemail.

180
00:17:21,518 --> 00:17:23,587
If we could keep this mix-up

181
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:25,689
from making its way
to the board of directors,

182
00:17:25,722 --> 00:17:27,658
I would appreciate it.

183
00:17:28,792 --> 00:17:30,627
Sure, that's fine.

184
00:17:30,995 --> 00:17:35,967
So, yes, you have an incredibly
rare incurable disease.

185
00:17:36,633 --> 00:17:38,102
It is inside your stomach,

186
00:17:38,136 --> 00:17:41,105
but will eventually spread
throughout your body.

187
00:17:41,139 --> 00:17:44,708
It will be painless,
but it is killing you.

188
00:17:45,009 --> 00:17:46,978
We cannot know how
long you have,

189
00:17:47,011 --> 00:17:49,981
but it is only a matter of time.

190
00:17:54,018 --> 00:17:55,652
What are my chances?

191
00:17:57,021 --> 00:17:58,588
Zero.

192
00:17:58,622 --> 00:18:00,124
There's a 98% chance

193
00:18:00,158 --> 00:18:02,759
you will succumb
to your illness.

194
00:18:03,895 --> 00:18:05,729
I thought you said
there isn't a chance.

195
00:18:05,762 --> 00:18:06,931
There isn't.

196
00:18:06,965 --> 00:18:08,765
Then what about the two percent?

197
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:12,736
That's the margin of error.
There's a 2% margin of error.

198
00:18:12,769 --> 00:18:14,838
Nothing is ever
absolutely certain,

199
00:18:14,871 --> 00:18:17,175
though this most certainly is.

200
00:18:18,977 --> 00:18:21,712
You're telling me there is a
margin of error of two percent,

201
00:18:21,745 --> 00:18:23,847
but you're certain
I'm definitely going to die?

202
00:18:23,881 --> 00:18:25,049
Yes.

203
00:18:25,749 --> 00:18:27,085
Unfortunately.

204
00:18:28,019 --> 00:18:31,022
You're taking this quite well,
I might add.

205
00:18:31,055 --> 00:18:34,558
Most people cry
when doctors give them bad news,

206
00:18:34,591 --> 00:18:37,561
which is why most
doctors are depressed.

207
00:18:39,063 --> 00:18:40,898
I don't want to die,

208
00:18:40,932 --> 00:18:42,900
but it sounds like
it's not up to me.

209
00:18:44,002 --> 00:18:46,170
To use a baseball analogy,

210
00:18:46,204 --> 00:18:48,839
life has thrown
you a curve ball.

211
00:18:49,207 --> 00:18:52,576
Curve balls are tricky throws
for the batter to hit.

212
00:18:52,609 --> 00:18:54,711
In this case, you're the batter.

213
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:58,715
Only, you're not even holding
a bat, so you most definitely

214
00:18:58,749 --> 00:19:01,052
are going to miss the ball.

215
00:19:02,853 --> 00:19:05,089
What's next?
What are my options?

216
00:19:06,024 --> 00:19:09,160
You should decide on
what type of funeral you want.

217
00:19:09,193 --> 00:19:11,795
It usually depends
on one's religious views,

218
00:19:11,828 --> 00:19:15,699
but it can also be a reflection
of your personality.

219
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,003
For example, I know
I want to be buried,

220
00:19:19,037 --> 00:19:20,871
not because I'm religious,

221
00:19:20,905 --> 00:19:25,043
but because I'm afraid
of being forgotten.

222
00:19:25,076 --> 00:19:28,179
I want my friends and family
to feel obligated

223
00:19:28,212 --> 00:19:30,081
to come and visit my grave.

224
00:19:31,715 --> 00:19:33,184
Of course, there are the remains

225
00:19:33,217 --> 00:19:36,020
from a cremation
that can be buried or interred,

226
00:19:36,054 --> 00:19:40,824
but people are less likely
to visit a pile of ashes.

227
00:19:41,025 --> 00:19:44,761
A body in a casket holds
more of an obligation.

228
00:19:45,263 --> 00:19:47,198
You can even be buried at sea,

229
00:19:47,231 --> 00:19:49,967
though that's usually
reserved for sailors.

230
00:19:50,268 --> 00:19:52,904
There are many options
to choose from.

231
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:59,876
I'll probably choose...
cremation.

232
00:20:02,213 --> 00:20:05,116
Then there is the decision
of whether or not

233
00:20:05,149 --> 00:20:08,051
you want to go ahead
with replacement.

234
00:20:08,818 --> 00:20:12,855
I'm sure you're already
familiar with the process.

235
00:20:12,889 --> 00:20:14,958
When you know
you're going to die,

236
00:20:14,991 --> 00:20:16,859
you can have yourself cloned

237
00:20:16,893 --> 00:20:20,863
so that your loved ones won't
have to suffer the loss of you.

238
00:20:20,897 --> 00:20:24,000
Here's a pamphlet, just in case.

239
00:20:24,034 --> 00:20:25,701
Thank you.

240
00:20:25,734 --> 00:20:28,838
Remember to discuss it
with your loved ones first.

241
00:20:28,871 --> 00:20:31,007
Replacement isn't for everyone.

242
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:34,810
For some families, it has even
been a negative experience.

243
00:20:35,178 --> 00:20:37,914
- Can I have this?
- Please.

244
00:20:59,735 --> 00:21:01,938
<i>Hi, there. My name is Tom.</i>

245
00:21:01,972 --> 00:21:04,740
<i>I'm the head West Coast
media relations officer</i>

246
00:21:04,773 --> 00:21:06,243
<i>here at The Facility.</i>

247
00:21:06,276 --> 00:21:08,211
<i>I'll be your host
for this introduction</i>

248
00:21:08,245 --> 00:21:10,247
<i>to the world of replacement.</i>

249
00:21:10,813 --> 00:21:12,916
<i>Of course, we all know
that cloning began dur...</i>

250
00:21:12,949 --> 00:21:14,783
<i>Our scientists have made</i>

251
00:21:14,817 --> 00:21:17,820
<i>countless exciting
breakthroughs and advances</i>

252
00:21:17,853 --> 00:21:20,290
<i>in The Facility's
proprietary technology.</i>

253
00:21:21,824 --> 00:21:23,792
<i>It's hard to imagine
that, at one point,</i>

254
00:21:23,826 --> 00:21:25,761
<i>this all seemed like
absurd science fiction.</i>

255
00:21:25,794 --> 00:21:27,230
<i>This period is known</i>

256
00:21:27,264 --> 00:21:29,032
<i>as "imprintation".</i>

257
00:21:29,065 --> 00:21:32,202
<i>Your double is more or less
a sponge at this point.</i>

258
00:21:33,836 --> 00:21:36,839
<i>They will soak up as much
of what makes you "you"</i>

259
00:21:36,872 --> 00:21:39,176
<i>as they can before you die.</i>

260
00:21:42,879 --> 00:21:44,881
<i>Down to the littlest detail.</i>

261
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:50,819
<i>The more time your double
spends learning about you,</i>

262
00:21:50,853 --> 00:21:52,989
the more "you" they will become.

263
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:02,132
<i>In some cases, however,</i>

264
00:22:02,165 --> 00:22:05,235
<i>your double may only have
a very short time with you.</i>

265
00:22:05,268 --> 00:22:08,804
<i>Such as in the case
of premeditated suicide.</i>

266
00:22:11,074 --> 00:22:13,842
<i>For originals who are very sad,</i>

267
00:22:13,876 --> 00:22:15,811
<i>everyday living is a struggle.</i>

268
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:20,183
<i>This double may look
just like his original,</i>

269
00:22:20,217 --> 00:22:23,320
<i>but he may as well be
a different person altogether.</i>

270
00:22:23,353 --> 00:22:26,822
<i>For some grieving families,
this is sufficient.</i>

271
00:22:28,091 --> 00:22:31,228
<i>I hope you found this video
fun and informative.</i>

272
00:22:31,261 --> 00:22:33,862
<i>You may be dying,
but don't let that affect</i>

273
00:22:33,897 --> 00:22:35,398
<i>those who love you most.</i>

274
00:22:35,432 --> 00:22:37,968
<i>Replacement is a gift to them.</i>

275
00:22:38,301 --> 00:22:40,070
<i>Isn't that right, darling?</i>

276
00:22:42,038 --> 00:22:43,406
<i>That's right.</i>

277
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,275
<i>I'm a former double,</i>

278
00:22:45,308 --> 00:22:48,078
<i>going on 12 years of being Tom.</i>

279
00:22:51,214 --> 00:22:53,216
<i>Replacement works.</i>

280
00:23:10,266 --> 00:23:12,268
Hi, I'm currently dying

281
00:23:12,301 --> 00:23:14,970
and I would like
to schedule a consultation.

282
00:24:06,121 --> 00:24:07,956
Ma'am, I'm sorry,
I forgot to ask you

283
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:09,992
for some sort of
proof you're dying.

284
00:24:10,025 --> 00:24:11,436
They should have
mentioned that on the phone

285
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:13,128
when you scheduled
your appointment.

286
00:24:13,162 --> 00:24:15,964
Yes, they told me. I have a copy
of my hospital charts.

287
00:24:15,998 --> 00:24:18,167
I can have my doctor fax
a note too if necessary.

288
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,601
No, the charts will do.

289
00:24:19,635 --> 00:24:21,413
I'm still not sure
I'm going to go through with it.

290
00:24:21,437 --> 00:24:23,481
I'd like to talk to someone
first, if that's all right.

291
00:24:23,505 --> 00:24:25,908
Of course. You still have
to fill out the form, though.

292
00:24:25,941 --> 00:24:27,609
Of course.

293
00:24:30,546 --> 00:24:32,448
There's no way
I can afford this.

294
00:24:33,148 --> 00:24:36,352
You must understand that this
is a gift for your loved ones.

295
00:24:37,052 --> 00:24:39,488
Can you put a price on them
not having to be sad?

296
00:24:40,456 --> 00:24:42,358
You're going to die.

297
00:24:42,391 --> 00:24:46,228
And we understand and are
sensitive to that inevitability.

298
00:24:46,261 --> 00:24:48,530
What we do is we set up
a payment plan.

299
00:24:48,564 --> 00:24:52,067
When you pass away
and your double becomes you,

300
00:24:52,101 --> 00:24:54,236
they take over
your responsibilities,

301
00:24:54,269 --> 00:24:56,071
and one of those
responsibilities

302
00:24:56,105 --> 00:24:58,307
is to keep paying
off the procedure.

303
00:24:59,174 --> 00:25:00,542
The most important thing is

304
00:25:00,576 --> 00:25:03,178
that you don't have
to worry about anything.

305
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:06,014
Other than dying with dignity.

306
00:25:08,517 --> 00:25:11,487
I'm afraid of needles,
and I sometimes have nightmares

307
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,921
of being put under anesthesia

308
00:25:12,955 --> 00:25:15,057
but waking up during
the surgery.

309
00:25:17,059 --> 00:25:19,061
All you have to do
is spit into this.

310
00:25:20,028 --> 00:25:21,497
How long does it all take?

311
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:23,098
About an hour.

312
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,502
Can I get you a refill?

313
00:25:26,535 --> 00:25:28,337
Yes, please, but only half.

314
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:30,038
I don't need a whole glass.

315
00:25:47,389 --> 00:25:48,557
Hello.

316
00:25:50,025 --> 00:25:51,460
Hi. You must be Sarah.

317
00:25:51,493 --> 00:25:53,328
I caught a glimpse
of myself in the mirror,

318
00:25:53,362 --> 00:25:55,063
and I look a lot like you.

319
00:25:56,231 --> 00:25:58,266
Yes, I'm Sarah.

320
00:26:02,303 --> 00:26:05,473
So, Sarah is your original.

321
00:26:05,506 --> 00:26:09,076
For now, you'll go by the name
Sarah's Double.

322
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:11,312
When you replace her,
you'll take her name.

323
00:26:13,648 --> 00:26:15,383
You have very clean skin.

324
00:26:15,616 --> 00:26:17,652
And your hair shines
in the light better than mine.

325
00:26:21,389 --> 00:26:23,057
I like your shirt.

326
00:26:25,159 --> 00:26:27,094
I should tell you
that there was an error

327
00:26:27,128 --> 00:26:29,063
in the coding process.

328
00:26:29,096 --> 00:26:31,032
It affected the gene
that determines eye color.

329
00:26:32,066 --> 00:26:34,502
We're happy to decommission
this double and try again

330
00:26:34,535 --> 00:26:36,270
if you'd like.

331
00:26:38,339 --> 00:26:40,374
Oh, no. That won't be necessary.

332
00:26:40,408 --> 00:26:42,210
Blue eyes are less common
and more interesting

333
00:26:42,243 --> 00:26:43,711
than brown eyes.

334
00:26:43,744 --> 00:26:46,080
Great. We'll give you
a five-percent discount

335
00:26:46,113 --> 00:26:48,382
on the process to
make it up to you.

336
00:26:48,416 --> 00:26:50,651
Oh, that would be wonderful.

337
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:54,155
Before he put me in these
temporary clothes,

338
00:26:54,188 --> 00:26:55,623
the technician made a joke to me

339
00:26:55,656 --> 00:26:57,558
about how now he's
seen you naked.

340
00:26:59,427 --> 00:27:01,128
Are you hungry?

341
00:27:01,162 --> 00:27:03,364
Not right now.

342
00:27:03,397 --> 00:27:05,099
What are some
of your favorite foods?

343
00:27:08,236 --> 00:27:10,271
I like Mexican food,

344
00:27:10,304 --> 00:27:13,708
Japanese food
and also Indian food.

345
00:27:15,109 --> 00:27:16,511
I can't wait to try those, then.

346
00:27:16,544 --> 00:27:19,080
What is your least
favorite kind of food?

347
00:27:20,181 --> 00:27:21,822
That's a good question.
Maybe French food.

348
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:23,551
It can be quite heavy.

349
00:27:23,584 --> 00:27:25,653
Is there
a style of music you like best?

350
00:27:26,487 --> 00:27:27,755
I like all kinds of music,

351
00:27:27,788 --> 00:27:29,724
particularly pop, rock,
and hip-hop.

352
00:27:29,757 --> 00:27:32,393
Would you like to
listen any of those right now?

353
00:27:32,426 --> 00:27:34,395
Maybe later.
I'm enjoying this conversation,

354
00:27:34,428 --> 00:27:36,430
and music might make it
hard to hear each other.

355
00:27:37,164 --> 00:27:40,201
Are there any styles of music
you don't like so much?

356
00:27:40,601 --> 00:27:42,103
Country.

357
00:27:42,603 --> 00:27:44,105
And Metal.

358
00:27:44,472 --> 00:27:46,107
It's just a bunch of noise.

359
00:27:59,153 --> 00:28:00,621
Welcome home.

360
00:28:00,655 --> 00:28:03,457
It's nice.
Do you live here alone?

361
00:28:03,491 --> 00:28:05,593
No, I live here
with my boyfriend, Peter.

362
00:28:05,626 --> 00:28:07,161
He's away on business, though.

363
00:28:07,194 --> 00:28:08,572
He won't be back
for several more weeks.

364
00:28:08,596 --> 00:28:10,665
I hope I get to see him again
before I die.

365
00:28:11,332 --> 00:28:13,534
He's very handsome
and hard-working.

366
00:28:14,201 --> 00:28:17,171
He sounds like it.
I'm excited to meet him.

367
00:28:17,204 --> 00:28:19,206
I'll introduce you
to my mom, too.

368
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,474
What about your dad?

369
00:28:20,741 --> 00:28:22,543
He passed away a few years ago.

370
00:28:23,244 --> 00:28:26,280
50 percent of marriages
end in divorce, but...

371
00:28:26,314 --> 00:28:28,349
my parents were still together
when he died.

372
00:28:28,382 --> 00:28:30,151
I never saw them fight.

373
00:28:30,418 --> 00:28:32,186
I know she misses him.

374
00:28:32,219 --> 00:28:34,221
I'm excited to meet your mom.

375
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:37,558
I haven't told
her about you yet.

376
00:28:37,592 --> 00:28:39,627
I haven't told Peter either,
but I'm going to.

377
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:42,296
Actually, I'm not sure I want
my mom to know I'm sick.

378
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:43,698
I'm afraid she'll be sad.

379
00:28:43,731 --> 00:28:45,399
I'm her only child.

380
00:28:45,433 --> 00:28:46,734
When you're gone,

381
00:28:46,767 --> 00:28:48,769
I promise to love her
as much as you do.

382
00:28:48,803 --> 00:28:50,371
Maybe more.

383
00:28:50,404 --> 00:28:51,639
Same for Peter.

384
00:28:51,672 --> 00:28:53,440
I will love him so much.

385
00:28:54,574 --> 00:28:56,276
Let's get some clothes for you.

386
00:29:07,721 --> 00:29:10,724
You don't have any cellulite
or love handles.

387
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:14,527
I guess I don't have
either of those things.

388
00:29:14,561 --> 00:29:15,695
You're right.

389
00:29:16,696 --> 00:29:18,598
Feels slightly loose on me.

390
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,435
I may be a size
smaller than you.

391
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:23,813
You should probably
take me shopping.

392
00:29:23,837 --> 00:29:25,705
What's your favorite
sexual position?

393
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:29,542
Um, it's boring,
but I like missionary.

394
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,612
Sometimes, it's nice
to be choked. Lightly.

395
00:29:33,246 --> 00:29:34,814
What's Peter's
favorite position?

396
00:29:36,549 --> 00:29:38,551
He likes standing
both from behind

397
00:29:38,585 --> 00:29:41,588
and facing each other,
and he likes to blindfold me,

398
00:29:41,621 --> 00:29:43,556
but I like to be able
to see him, though.

399
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:45,692
Sure, but I imagine
not being able to see

400
00:29:45,725 --> 00:29:47,394
heightens the other senses.

401
00:29:47,427 --> 00:29:50,230
You know, I don't think
I care for this top.

402
00:29:50,263 --> 00:29:52,824
Maybe when you take me shopping,
I'll look for a different style.

403
00:29:58,805 --> 00:30:01,441
Sweetheart,
have you seen my shoes?

404
00:30:01,474 --> 00:30:03,510
Uh, are they these black ones?

405
00:30:03,543 --> 00:30:05,278
No, those are Sarah's.

406
00:30:05,311 --> 00:30:08,682
Mine are tan and
more fashionable.

407
00:30:08,715 --> 00:30:10,383
Never mind. I found them.

408
00:30:10,417 --> 00:30:12,452
They were by the door
where I usually leave them.

409
00:30:12,485 --> 00:30:14,454
Wow, sweetheart,

410
00:30:14,487 --> 00:30:16,623
you look beautiful.

411
00:30:17,323 --> 00:30:19,626
So do you.

412
00:30:27,567 --> 00:30:29,536
Which restaurant
are we going to?

413
00:30:29,569 --> 00:30:32,338
We are going
to a French brasserie.

414
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:34,340
French food is my favorite.

415
00:30:37,343 --> 00:30:38,611
Oh, hey, Sarah.

416
00:30:38,645 --> 00:30:40,413
Sorry, I didn't see you there.

417
00:30:40,447 --> 00:30:42,382
Peter and I are going on a date.

418
00:30:42,415 --> 00:30:44,885
I think we all knew there was
something between Peter and me.

419
00:30:44,919 --> 00:30:47,687
So, it's nice
to just be open about it.

420
00:30:47,721 --> 00:30:49,622
I really value your friendship.

421
00:30:49,656 --> 00:30:51,324
I'll miss that when you die.

422
00:30:51,357 --> 00:30:53,860
Speaking of which, any updates?

423
00:30:56,663 --> 00:30:58,498
I have a doctor's
appointment tomorrow.

424
00:30:58,531 --> 00:31:00,633
Honey, we should hurry,
or we're going to be late.

425
00:31:00,667 --> 00:31:01,868
Okay.

426
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:06,907
Peter and I will probably make
love when we get home tonight.

427
00:31:06,941 --> 00:31:10,443
As you know, I tend to be loud,
so I wanted you to be aware.

428
00:31:19,652 --> 00:31:21,688
Please, come in.

429
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:23,690
Have a seat.

430
00:31:26,459 --> 00:31:27,794
How are you feeling?

431
00:31:27,827 --> 00:31:29,662
I feel okay.

432
00:31:29,696 --> 00:31:31,674
It's been completely painless,
just as you said it would be.

433
00:31:31,698 --> 00:31:33,533
The worst part has
been the waiting.

434
00:31:33,566 --> 00:31:35,435
I know it's coming,
but I don't know when.

435
00:31:35,835 --> 00:31:37,604
I go to sleep every
night thinking,

436
00:31:37,637 --> 00:31:39,940
"Maybe tomorrow will be
the day I don't wake up."

437
00:31:39,974 --> 00:31:42,442
I'd rather die in my sleep
than die awake.

438
00:31:42,475 --> 00:31:44,744
I'd rather not be able
to feel it happening.

439
00:31:44,778 --> 00:31:47,647
Sarah, I don't know
how to tell you this,

440
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:50,415
other than direct
and to the point.

441
00:31:51,483 --> 00:31:53,619
You've gone into
complete remission.

442
00:31:54,586 --> 00:31:56,522
You're not dying anymore.

443
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:00,492
You told me it was certain.

444
00:32:00,526 --> 00:32:03,495
I did mention
the margin of error.

445
00:32:04,463 --> 00:32:05,864
Are you sure?

446
00:32:05,899 --> 00:32:07,967
My stomach is hurting
a little bit right now.

447
00:32:08,001 --> 00:32:10,769
Did you have anything to
eat for breakfast this morning?

448
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:13,405
No.

449
00:32:13,438 --> 00:32:15,607
You're most likely
just hungry, then.

450
00:32:16,475 --> 00:32:17,776
I don't understand.

451
00:32:18,443 --> 00:32:21,713
To be perfectly honest,
we don't either.

452
00:32:21,747 --> 00:32:23,983
But it seems
you've recovered completely

453
00:32:24,017 --> 00:32:26,385
and there's no reason
to think you can't live

454
00:32:26,418 --> 00:32:27,820
a long, fulfilling life.

455
00:32:29,022 --> 00:32:31,390
Your family will be thrilled.

456
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:34,760
I never told my mom.

457
00:32:34,793 --> 00:32:36,395
Why not?

458
00:32:36,428 --> 00:32:38,097
I didn't want her to worry.

459
00:32:38,131 --> 00:32:40,699
My double was going to take over
like nothing ever happened.

460
00:32:40,732 --> 00:32:42,467
With contact lenses, of course.

461
00:32:42,501 --> 00:32:43,836
She wouldn't have to miss me.

462
00:32:44,636 --> 00:32:46,505
You should see The Facility

463
00:32:46,538 --> 00:32:48,473
about having your double
decommissioned.

464
00:32:48,507 --> 00:32:51,476
By law, the only people
who are allowed doubles

465
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:52,845
are people who are dying,

466
00:32:52,879 --> 00:32:55,647
and you are no longer
one of those people.

467
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:46,698
We actually went roller-skating.

468
00:33:47,699 --> 00:33:50,003
Oh, it was fun.
I fell, didn't I?

469
00:33:50,036 --> 00:33:52,504
Very badly, but it was fun.

470
00:33:52,537 --> 00:33:55,674
I used to roller skate.
With your father.

471
00:33:55,707 --> 00:33:57,110
Oh.

472
00:33:59,511 --> 00:34:00,980
You introduced her to my mom?

473
00:34:01,014 --> 00:34:02,547
Sarah, what's going on?

474
00:34:02,581 --> 00:34:03,917
Mom, I'm Sarah.

475
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:08,820
You agreed to wait until I died

476
00:34:08,854 --> 00:34:10,756
before you introduced her
to my mom as me.

477
00:34:10,789 --> 00:34:12,058
Died?

478
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:13,993
I didn't introduce
your double to your mom.

479
00:34:14,027 --> 00:34:16,930
She's been in contact with her
on her own for months now.

480
00:34:17,562 --> 00:34:19,498
You're pretending to be me?

481
00:34:19,531 --> 00:34:21,566
While I'm still alive,
you're talking to her?

482
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,969
Someone had to.

483
00:34:23,002 --> 00:34:24,904
All your mother wanted
was a call here and there

484
00:34:24,938 --> 00:34:26,605
from the daughter she loves.

485
00:34:26,638 --> 00:34:29,108
Sarah, will one of you
please tell me what's happening?

486
00:34:29,142 --> 00:34:30,709
I was dying.

487
00:34:30,742 --> 00:34:32,744
I had a disease
that was killing me,

488
00:34:32,778 --> 00:34:34,646
and so, I decided
to get a replacement

489
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,121
so that you wouldn't
have to miss me.

490
00:34:36,815 --> 00:34:38,583
Why didn't you tell me?

491
00:34:38,885 --> 00:34:41,054
I know. I did this for you.

492
00:34:41,087 --> 00:34:42,889
It was supposed to
be a nice gift.

493
00:34:45,123 --> 00:34:46,925
How much longer do you have?

494
00:34:48,894 --> 00:34:50,861
That's the thing.

495
00:34:50,896 --> 00:34:52,730
It's almost funny.

496
00:34:52,763 --> 00:34:54,665
I did all of this for nothing.

497
00:34:56,168 --> 00:34:57,668
What do you mean?

498
00:34:59,171 --> 00:35:01,605
I'm not going to die after all.

499
00:35:01,639 --> 00:35:03,875
I just left my doctor's office,
and I'm in remission.

500
00:35:04,809 --> 00:35:06,744
You're going to be
decommissioned.

501
00:35:08,914 --> 00:35:10,648
And we can go back
to being together

502
00:35:10,681 --> 00:35:12,583
and everything can
go back to normal.

503
00:35:14,785 --> 00:35:15,997
What do you mean decommissioned?

504
00:35:16,021 --> 00:35:17,255
Don't worry, Mother.

505
00:35:17,289 --> 00:35:18,890
No, don't you fucking
talk to her.

506
00:35:18,924 --> 00:35:21,692
You're done. I am going
to fucking abort you!

507
00:35:21,726 --> 00:35:23,828
- All right, come on.
- I'm Sarah, not you.

508
00:35:23,861 --> 00:35:25,663
You're nothing. You're no one.

509
00:35:25,696 --> 00:35:28,066
Come on, let's go outside.

510
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:42,047
You're not kissing me.
Here, try again.

511
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:44,149
- Eh... What are you doing?
- What do you mean?

512
00:35:45,083 --> 00:35:46,617
I'm with her now.

513
00:35:46,952 --> 00:35:48,186
Didn't you hear me?

514
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:50,055
She's going to be
decommissioned.

515
00:35:50,088 --> 00:35:53,058
So... we can go back
to you and me.

516
00:35:53,091 --> 00:35:54,859
It's not that simple.

517
00:35:56,962 --> 00:35:58,696
What is it about her?

518
00:36:00,831 --> 00:36:02,633
It's little things.

519
00:36:03,135 --> 00:36:05,003
Like her inflection
when she says my name.

520
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:08,140
Hers goes up. Peter!
Yours is flat. Peter.

521
00:36:09,107 --> 00:36:11,143
I can say your name
that way if you want.

522
00:36:11,776 --> 00:36:14,712
Just tell me what you want me
to be, and I'll be it for you.

523
00:36:17,115 --> 00:36:19,683
You always try too hard
to impress new people.

524
00:36:19,717 --> 00:36:21,086
You speak over me or for me.

525
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:23,721
You have to control
social situations.

526
00:36:23,754 --> 00:36:25,656
I'm embarrassed to
go out with you.

527
00:36:25,689 --> 00:36:26,833
Every time we go out,
my co-workers

528
00:36:26,857 --> 00:36:28,759
make fun of you
behind your back.

529
00:36:28,793 --> 00:36:30,704
That is, when I can actually
get you to leave the house,

530
00:36:30,728 --> 00:36:32,164
and even if I do,
it's always on me.

531
00:36:32,197 --> 00:36:34,299
I can't do it anymore.

532
00:36:36,734 --> 00:36:39,770
Even if I can't be with her,
I don't want to be with you.

533
00:36:44,708 --> 00:36:46,078
I love you, Peter.

534
00:36:47,112 --> 00:36:49,281
And no one will ever love you
as much as I do.

535
00:36:50,916 --> 00:36:52,683
I know.

536
00:36:52,716 --> 00:36:54,953
But I don't love you anymore.

537
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:01,026
What's it like to fuck me

538
00:37:01,059 --> 00:37:02,793
while you look into
someone else's eyes?

539
00:37:05,763 --> 00:37:07,665
You need therapy, Sarah.

540
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,275
Wait, this is my mom's house.

541
00:37:23,048 --> 00:37:25,083
Mom? Hey, Mom.

542
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:26,885
Peter locked me out.

543
00:37:55,212 --> 00:37:59,049
I hope the decommission process
is painful for you, bitch!

544
00:37:59,083 --> 00:38:02,286
And I hope it's emotionally
painful for the two of you!

545
00:38:09,826 --> 00:38:11,061
Hello?

546
00:38:11,095 --> 00:38:12,729
<i>Is this Sarah?</i>

547
00:38:12,762 --> 00:38:13,998
Yes. Who's this?

548
00:38:14,031 --> 00:38:15,432
<i>I represent your double.</i>

549
00:38:15,466 --> 00:38:17,234
<i>This call is to notify you
that she will be</i>

550
00:38:17,268 --> 00:38:19,003
<i>exercising her rights
in accordance</i>

551
00:38:19,036 --> 00:38:21,038
<i>with the 28th Amendment
of the Constitution.</i>

552
00:38:21,071 --> 00:38:23,207
<i>Your double has filed
a motion to stay.</i>

553
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,176
What do you mean "stay"?

554
00:38:25,209 --> 00:38:27,211
<i>I suggest you
consult with legal counsel.</i>

555
00:38:27,244 --> 00:38:29,013
<i>Have a nice day.</i>

556
00:38:35,352 --> 00:38:37,787
It's a fairly standard
motion to stay.

557
00:38:38,389 --> 00:38:40,224
All the usual stipulations.

558
00:38:41,858 --> 00:38:43,860
No contact with your double
starting immediately.

559
00:38:44,995 --> 00:38:46,373
Because the lease
is in your ex's name,

560
00:38:46,397 --> 00:38:48,032
you're being asked to move out.

561
00:38:48,065 --> 00:38:50,935
They're giving you two days,
which is quite generous,

562
00:38:50,968 --> 00:38:52,735
as usually it's only one.

563
00:38:52,769 --> 00:38:55,139
The duel to the death will be
in approximately one year.

564
00:38:55,172 --> 00:38:58,108
The exact date to be determined
by the court at a later time.

565
00:38:58,142 --> 00:38:59,476
And you'll be expected to pay

566
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:01,078
support to your double
in the interim.

567
00:39:01,111 --> 00:39:03,047
Wait, did you say
duel to the death?

568
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,382
Yes, it is to determine
which of you will live

569
00:39:05,416 --> 00:39:06,984
the rest of Sarah's life.

570
00:39:07,017 --> 00:39:08,361
We can't have two of you
walking around forever.

571
00:39:08,385 --> 00:39:09,987
That would be ridiculous.

572
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:11,854
I thought she was going
to be decommissioned.

573
00:39:11,889 --> 00:39:13,257
Well, in cases such as yours,

574
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:15,326
when an original is going
to live after all,

575
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:17,860
the double is usually
decommissioned, yes.

576
00:39:17,895 --> 00:39:19,897
But, in even rarer cases,

577
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:21,831
when a double has been
in the world long enough

578
00:39:21,864 --> 00:39:23,400
to start becoming
their own person,

579
00:39:23,434 --> 00:39:26,270
they sometimes would prefer
to continue to live.

580
00:39:26,303 --> 00:39:28,939
They can request a stay
and a duel is set.

581
00:39:28,973 --> 00:39:30,975
I thought the duels
were only for prisoners

582
00:39:31,008 --> 00:39:32,809
who commit the crime
worse than murder.

583
00:39:32,842 --> 00:39:34,411
They're also used for stays.

584
00:39:34,445 --> 00:39:36,180
Haven't even seen
one on television?

585
00:39:36,213 --> 00:39:37,948
They're quite popular.

586
00:39:38,315 --> 00:39:41,151
I don't care for violence.
It makes me nauseous.

587
00:39:41,185 --> 00:39:42,953
Well, you'll need
to get over that

588
00:39:42,987 --> 00:39:45,155
if you want any chance
of surviving your duel.

589
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:48,825
I suggest taking personal
combat training lessons

590
00:39:48,858 --> 00:39:50,361
from a personal combat trainer.

591
00:39:51,228 --> 00:39:53,197
Also, we should
discuss my rates.

592
00:40:10,347 --> 00:40:13,017
You can take the sheets with
the giant blood stain on them.

593
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:14,952
You should have
washed them in cold water.

594
00:40:15,352 --> 00:40:17,321
You can take anything you like.

595
00:40:17,354 --> 00:40:19,356
Your double has
different taste than you,

596
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:21,325
and we'd like to
redecorate anyway.

597
00:40:21,358 --> 00:40:24,061
Maybe leave the couch, though,
and the nice coffee table.

598
00:40:24,094 --> 00:40:26,196
But other than that,
you can take anything you like.

599
00:40:28,098 --> 00:40:29,400
Hey, sweetheart!

600
00:40:29,433 --> 00:40:31,201
<i>Is she still there?</i>

601
00:40:31,235 --> 00:40:34,004
Yes, she is,
but she's going to be gone soon.

602
00:40:34,038 --> 00:40:35,872
<i>I'm glad I don't have to see</i>

603
00:40:35,905 --> 00:40:37,440
<i>her disgusting face
again for a while.</i>

604
00:40:38,141 --> 00:40:40,977
<i>Oh, tell her to take
the bloody sheets with her.</i>

605
00:40:41,911 --> 00:40:43,913
Don't worry. I already did.

606
00:40:43,946 --> 00:40:45,214
<i>Good.</i>

607
00:40:47,183 --> 00:40:48,251
<i>I miss you.</i>

608
00:40:48,918 --> 00:40:50,119
I miss you, too.

609
00:41:24,087 --> 00:41:26,155
Do you want to live?

610
00:41:29,225 --> 00:41:30,993
Yes.

611
00:41:33,029 --> 00:41:34,263
I don't believe you.

612
00:41:35,998 --> 00:41:37,433
I want to live.

613
00:41:38,167 --> 00:41:40,269
Because if you know
that you do not care

614
00:41:40,303 --> 00:41:42,138
if you live or die in your duel,

615
00:41:42,171 --> 00:41:44,140
you may as well
tell me right now.

616
00:41:44,173 --> 00:41:48,010
I will tear up your contract,
and you can spend all the money

617
00:41:48,044 --> 00:41:51,381
that you save over the next year
on drugs and alcohol,

618
00:41:51,414 --> 00:41:54,484
vacations to the beach, sex...

619
00:41:55,418 --> 00:41:57,453
trips to amusement parks.

620
00:41:59,155 --> 00:42:01,157
You will surely
die in your duel,

621
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:03,292
but you will have lived
your last year on Earth

622
00:42:03,326 --> 00:42:06,396
in an excessive
and exciting fashion.

623
00:42:09,198 --> 00:42:11,200
I said I want to live.

624
00:42:13,336 --> 00:42:15,405
Are you prepared to kill?

625
00:42:17,407 --> 00:42:18,541
Yes.

626
00:42:20,443 --> 00:42:22,145
I believe you.

627
00:42:24,414 --> 00:42:27,583
First, we need to get
your body healthy and ready...

628
00:42:28,418 --> 00:42:30,052
for what's to come.

629
00:42:32,422 --> 00:42:34,624
We'll start with some
general calisthenics.

630
00:43:16,399 --> 00:43:17,500
Come on.

631
00:43:40,155 --> 00:43:41,590
I feel like I'm
going to throw up.

632
00:43:42,224 --> 00:43:44,593
It's due to all
the lactic acid in your blood.

633
00:43:44,626 --> 00:43:46,661
It's temporarily poisoning you.

634
00:43:47,462 --> 00:43:50,398
Don't worry. The feeling
will go away eventually.

635
00:43:53,235 --> 00:43:54,503
I'm going to live.

636
00:43:54,536 --> 00:43:56,204
This is my life.

637
00:43:56,238 --> 00:43:58,273
She's not going
to take it from me.

638
00:44:04,246 --> 00:44:06,381
I want you to watch
that tonight.

639
00:44:06,414 --> 00:44:09,150
It's not very good,
but there are some images in it

640
00:44:09,184 --> 00:44:11,286
that I want you
to get used to seeing.

641
00:44:12,687 --> 00:44:14,356
I'll see you tomorrow.

642
00:44:46,421 --> 00:44:48,523
<i>Oh, for crying out loud.</i>

643
00:44:48,557 --> 00:44:52,460
<i>Barbara, I told you don't leave
your ring next to the sink.</i>

644
00:45:01,703 --> 00:45:03,538
<i>Got ya.</i>

645
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:07,709
<i>Barbara, I'm stuck. Barbara!</i>

646
00:45:11,379 --> 00:45:14,482
<i>Barbara, quit kidding around.
Barbara, this isn't funny.</i>

647
00:45:17,385 --> 00:45:18,587
<i>Barbara, stop.</i>

648
00:45:20,455 --> 00:45:22,424
<i>Barbara, stop. I'm your husband.</i>

649
00:45:57,826 --> 00:45:59,527
You were right.

650
00:45:59,561 --> 00:46:01,505
The plot was convoluted
and the acting wasn't very good,

651
00:46:01,529 --> 00:46:03,431
but I see why you wanted me
to watch it.

652
00:46:03,465 --> 00:46:05,667
I'll send you home
with the sequel today.

653
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:08,503
It's a worse film,
but it's even more violent.

654
00:46:08,770 --> 00:46:12,240
Are you ready to get started?

655
00:46:39,733 --> 00:46:41,802
It will take place on a field.

656
00:46:42,670 --> 00:46:45,639
Usually a football field
or a soccer field,

657
00:46:45,673 --> 00:46:48,676
or sometimes even a public park,
if there's enough space.

658
00:46:49,510 --> 00:46:52,881
Each opponent will stand
on opposite ends of the field.

659
00:46:53,514 --> 00:46:56,450
An official will signal
for the officials on the field

660
00:46:56,483 --> 00:46:59,353
to remove a sheet
covering a table.

661
00:47:08,395 --> 00:47:12,901
On the table,
there will be five weapons.

662
00:47:12,934 --> 00:47:16,403
Your opponent will have
an identical cache of weapons.

663
00:47:16,437 --> 00:47:18,940
You will have 10 seconds
to choose a weapon.

664
00:47:18,973 --> 00:47:21,375
Your opponent will be
obstructed from view

665
00:47:21,408 --> 00:47:23,912
during this 10-second long
decision-making process.

666
00:47:25,479 --> 00:47:28,716
If there is a gun on the table,

667
00:47:28,749 --> 00:47:32,453
it is most likely that both
combatants will choose it.

668
00:47:33,988 --> 00:47:36,590
But guns run out of bullets.

669
00:47:38,792 --> 00:47:42,696
And axe does not need bullets
to slice through an arm.

670
00:47:43,898 --> 00:47:48,435
An axe is much
heavier and slower

671
00:47:48,469 --> 00:47:53,607
than a dagger, which you need
to be in close proximity to use.

672
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:58,812
So, you see, it is all about
careful yet decisive strategy.

673
00:48:00,547 --> 00:48:01,782
Yes?

674
00:48:01,815 --> 00:48:03,450
What happens
if you drop your weapon

675
00:48:03,484 --> 00:48:05,552
and are too far away from
the table to grab another?

676
00:48:05,819 --> 00:48:07,855
I like that you're
already thinking this way.

677
00:48:07,889 --> 00:48:09,790
How many weapons
do you see here?

678
00:48:11,825 --> 00:48:13,727
Five.

679
00:48:13,761 --> 00:48:15,562
Count again.

680
00:48:17,698 --> 00:48:19,666
I still count five.

681
00:48:20,501 --> 00:48:22,703
There are six weapons.

682
00:48:22,736 --> 00:48:25,940
A properly trained human body
is a weapon.

683
00:48:27,976 --> 00:48:31,012
I would like for you to start
working out on your own time.

684
00:48:31,045 --> 00:48:33,480
This way, we can spend
an entire hour

685
00:48:33,514 --> 00:48:35,716
on weapons training
and hand-to-hand combat.

686
00:48:36,050 --> 00:48:38,619
I'm sometimes unmotivated
to work out on my own.

687
00:48:38,652 --> 00:48:40,955
It's easier when there's
someone there pushing me.

688
00:48:41,588 --> 00:48:43,657
The key is finding
something that you enjoy.

689
00:48:43,690 --> 00:48:45,592
There are many activities
that you can do

690
00:48:45,626 --> 00:48:47,929
that are also a great workout
such as bike riding,

691
00:48:47,962 --> 00:48:50,464
rock climbing, dancing,
or even swimming.

692
00:48:51,032 --> 00:48:53,767
Oh, I almost forgot.
I'll get you that DVD.

693
00:50:24,757 --> 00:50:27,060
For number three,
I chose slit throat.

694
00:50:27,094 --> 00:50:28,661
Excellent.

695
00:50:31,098 --> 00:50:32,065
Hm.

696
00:50:32,099 --> 00:50:33,901
Remember, no emotion.

697
00:50:33,934 --> 00:50:35,068
Sorry.

698
00:50:36,036 --> 00:50:38,671
I chose blunt-force trauma
to the head.

699
00:50:42,642 --> 00:50:44,077
I knew this one right away.

700
00:50:44,111 --> 00:50:45,955
This is definitely
a gunshot wound to the chest,

701
00:50:45,979 --> 00:50:48,048
most likely from
a low-caliber weapon.

702
00:50:48,081 --> 00:50:49,950
It has probably
punctured his lung.

703
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:52,019
Gunshot wound. Good.

704
00:50:54,787 --> 00:50:57,391
Arrow to the head.

705
00:51:00,793 --> 00:51:03,763
- Multiple stab wounds.
- Excellent.

706
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:08,902
This one was difficult.

707
00:51:08,936 --> 00:51:10,670
I saw you
having trouble with it.

708
00:51:10,703 --> 00:51:12,105
What did you decide on?

709
00:51:13,706 --> 00:51:15,775
I wasn't sure, but I picked...

710
00:51:16,877 --> 00:51:18,644
electrocution?

711
00:51:19,612 --> 00:51:20,948
Good guess.

712
00:51:20,981 --> 00:51:22,916
But remember, there would be
visual indicators

713
00:51:22,950 --> 00:51:26,619
such as singed hair or clothing
and burns to the body.

714
00:51:26,652 --> 00:51:28,754
This is a death by poison.

715
00:51:28,788 --> 00:51:30,924
Of course.
I should have known it.

716
00:51:30,958 --> 00:51:34,727
It's okay.
You only missed this one,

717
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:37,730
and poison is hardly
a weapon chosen by the court,

718
00:51:37,763 --> 00:51:40,233
because it is slow to act
and not as visually exciting.

719
00:51:42,102 --> 00:51:44,837
Once, I accidentally cut myself
with a pair of scissors

720
00:51:44,871 --> 00:51:46,739
while trimming my bangs.

721
00:51:46,772 --> 00:51:48,017
As I washed the wound in
the sink,

722
00:51:48,041 --> 00:51:49,876
it began to bleed,
and I fainted.

723
00:51:49,910 --> 00:51:52,012
I'm lucky I didn't fall
on the scissors.

724
00:51:52,778 --> 00:51:55,614
But now, even a mutilated body
barely phases me.

725
00:51:56,249 --> 00:51:58,952
Photos of a mutilated
human body.

726
00:51:59,987 --> 00:52:02,122
Photos. Yes.

727
00:52:03,924 --> 00:52:06,093
I've set up a field trip
for you next week.

728
00:52:06,126 --> 00:52:08,161
I'm not entirely
sure when it will be

729
00:52:08,195 --> 00:52:10,063
due to the nature
of the activity,

730
00:52:10,097 --> 00:52:12,232
but I will let you know
the day before.

731
00:52:12,265 --> 00:52:15,102
By the way, I called the bank
about my card being declined,

732
00:52:15,135 --> 00:52:17,669
I have to pay an overdraft fee,
which is frustrating,

733
00:52:17,702 --> 00:52:19,671
but you should have this month's
payment tomorrow.

734
00:52:19,704 --> 00:52:21,073
Thank you for sorting that out.

735
00:52:21,107 --> 00:52:22,975
Between the personal
combat training,

736
00:52:23,009 --> 00:52:24,743
clone support,
and hip-hop dance classes,

737
00:52:24,776 --> 00:52:26,154
money has been
a little tight recently.

738
00:52:26,178 --> 00:52:27,980
I understand.

739
00:52:28,014 --> 00:52:31,917
Sometimes it's possible to pay
for services in other ways.

740
00:52:31,951 --> 00:52:34,753
Maybe we can come up
with some sort of arrangement

741
00:52:34,786 --> 00:52:36,654
that is mutually beneficial.

742
00:52:42,928 --> 00:52:44,230
How much is this?

743
00:52:47,266 --> 00:52:49,701
$2.08 including tax.

744
00:52:52,905 --> 00:52:56,042
Uh, 1 dollar and 34 cents
on pump 2, please.

745
00:53:09,889 --> 00:53:11,257
Hello?

746
00:53:12,791 --> 00:53:14,193
Where is that?

747
00:53:44,890 --> 00:53:46,192
Can I help you?

748
00:53:46,225 --> 00:53:48,027
Trent told me to come see you.

749
00:53:49,361 --> 00:53:50,930
Even though it's covered,

750
00:53:50,963 --> 00:53:53,798
I'm sure you can
already tell what this is.

751
00:53:53,832 --> 00:53:55,167
A person.

752
00:53:55,201 --> 00:53:57,369
A body.

753
00:53:57,403 --> 00:54:01,874
This body was once a person,
but now it is just a body.

754
00:54:13,319 --> 00:54:16,855
You'll notice she was
about your age when she died.

755
00:54:17,323 --> 00:54:20,226
She has your hair color,
your eye color,

756
00:54:20,259 --> 00:54:22,228
and even looks
a little like you.

757
00:54:22,261 --> 00:54:24,163
Was she killed in a duel?

758
00:54:24,897 --> 00:54:26,232
No, she was not.

759
00:54:26,265 --> 00:54:29,034
She was killed
while riding a motorcycle.

760
00:54:30,369 --> 00:54:33,139
Her friends and family say
she was a safe driver.

761
00:54:33,973 --> 00:54:35,975
She was even wearing
a full-face helmet,

762
00:54:36,008 --> 00:54:38,978
but another vehicle
ran a red light.

763
00:54:39,178 --> 00:54:41,247
And struck her head-on.

764
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:43,848
She was alive for a few minutes.

765
00:54:44,849 --> 00:54:46,886
Witnesses say she even admitted

766
00:54:46,919 --> 00:54:49,088
she should have
purchased a car instead.

767
00:54:50,289 --> 00:54:51,924
What was her name?

768
00:54:53,025 --> 00:54:54,326
That doesn't matter.

769
00:54:55,294 --> 00:54:58,297
First, we need to open up
the chest cavity

770
00:54:58,330 --> 00:55:00,332
and inspect the vital organs.

771
00:55:01,866 --> 00:55:03,335
I'm cutting into the skin...

772
00:55:09,041 --> 00:55:12,377
pulling it back to allow access.

773
00:55:17,282 --> 00:55:19,384
There. Next...

774
00:55:21,219 --> 00:55:25,023
we cut the ribs
surrounding the chest plate.

775
00:55:36,067 --> 00:55:39,170
Then we cut away the cartilage

776
00:55:39,204 --> 00:55:41,439
revealing the heart and...

777
00:56:00,091 --> 00:56:03,261
Bang, bang, bang.
Ah, the gun jammed.

778
00:56:03,461 --> 00:56:06,197
The first two shots missed, but
the last one got me in my side.

779
00:56:06,231 --> 00:56:08,166
It missed my vital
organs, though.

780
00:56:16,374 --> 00:56:18,042
Boom!

781
00:56:18,076 --> 00:56:20,211
Nice thinking.
Destroying my weapons cache

782
00:56:20,245 --> 00:56:22,146
would have definitely
sealed my fate.

783
00:56:31,990 --> 00:56:33,157
Ah!

784
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:38,196
- Stab.
- Ah! I'm less mobile now.

785
00:56:39,197 --> 00:56:40,999
Stab, stab.

786
00:56:41,032 --> 00:56:43,268
The first stab
punctures my liver.

787
00:56:43,301 --> 00:56:46,304
I will die from this wound,
but not immediately.

788
00:56:46,938 --> 00:56:48,506
It will be slow and painful.

789
00:56:48,539 --> 00:56:50,375
I'm taking you out
with me, though.

790
00:56:50,408 --> 00:56:52,410
Slice.

791
00:56:52,443 --> 00:56:54,312
I'm cut.

792
00:56:55,046 --> 00:56:57,181
I'm bleeding severely,
and, oh, no.

793
00:56:57,215 --> 00:56:59,117
The knife got knocked
out of my hand.

794
00:57:02,053 --> 00:57:05,123
- Ah, ah...
- I block the sword,

795
00:57:05,156 --> 00:57:07,392
and tie up your hands
with the garrotte.

796
00:57:08,459 --> 00:57:10,528
Not only did that
force me to lose my grip,

797
00:57:10,561 --> 00:57:13,498
but it's also slicing into
the radial artery of my wrist.

798
00:57:13,531 --> 00:57:14,966
Ah!

799
00:57:18,369 --> 00:57:22,073
Not only is this cutting off
the blood supply to my brain,

800
00:57:22,106 --> 00:57:24,942
but the wire is
slicing into my flesh.

801
00:57:26,444 --> 00:57:28,079
I'm dead.

802
00:57:31,516 --> 00:57:32,950
Good.

803
00:57:34,319 --> 00:57:36,054
You should have used the gun.

804
00:57:36,087 --> 00:57:38,356
Always use the gun
if it's an option.

805
00:57:39,257 --> 00:57:40,525
I know, I just...

806
00:57:40,558 --> 00:57:42,427
I find guns to be
boring and overused.

807
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:44,395
I know what you mean,
but if it's the difference

808
00:57:44,429 --> 00:57:46,397
between life and death,
it's okay to be boring.

809
00:57:48,199 --> 00:57:50,001
Only a week to go,
but I would say

810
00:57:50,034 --> 00:57:53,571
that you're feeling very strong,
both physically, and mentally,

811
00:57:54,472 --> 00:57:56,341
I'm going to kill her.

812
00:57:57,575 --> 00:57:59,243
I just know it.

813
00:58:08,085 --> 00:58:10,087
Can I help you find anything?

814
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:11,588
No.

815
00:58:11,621 --> 00:58:13,256
I'm just browsing.

816
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:15,592
Well, let me know
if I can help in any way.

817
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:19,363
Wait!

818
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:22,499
I'm looking for
an outfit to die in.

819
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:26,036
You're in luck.
We just got some pieces in

820
00:58:26,069 --> 00:58:28,238
for the new season
that are to die for.

821
00:58:28,271 --> 00:58:30,640
No, not to die <i>for.</i> To die <i>in.</i>

822
00:58:31,541 --> 00:58:33,510
I'm looking for an outfit
that if, hypothetically,

823
00:58:33,543 --> 00:58:36,079
I were to die in,
I would be okay with.

824
00:58:36,113 --> 00:58:38,291
Something that reflects my
personality and is functional,

825
00:58:38,315 --> 00:58:40,484
but mainly, I need it
to be flattering to my figure.

826
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:42,386
I've gotten in shape
over the past year,

827
00:58:42,419 --> 00:58:44,354
but I still carry insecurities
about my body.

828
00:58:44,388 --> 00:58:46,456
If I'm going to die, well,

829
00:58:46,490 --> 00:58:48,525
at least I want to do it
looking my best.

830
00:58:49,459 --> 00:58:51,595
I don't care how much it costs.

831
00:58:58,702 --> 00:59:00,303
Fuck!

832
00:59:06,109 --> 00:59:07,277
Shit!

833
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:12,382
What do you mean, "postponed"?

834
00:59:12,416 --> 00:59:14,050
<i>Due to weather.</i>

835
00:59:14,084 --> 00:59:15,452
I don't mind getting wet.

836
00:59:15,485 --> 00:59:16,953
<i>Well, the issue isn't rain.</i>

837
00:59:16,987 --> 00:59:18,297
<i>There's a chance
for thunderstorms.</i>

838
00:59:18,321 --> 00:59:19,656
Then when?

839
00:59:19,689 --> 00:59:21,158
<i>In a month.</i>

840
00:59:21,191 --> 00:59:22,359
A month.

841
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:24,261
<i>Another thing.</i>

842
00:59:24,294 --> 00:59:26,396
<i>This delay is considered
an act of God.</i>

843
00:59:26,430 --> 00:59:29,132
<i>So you'll need to continue
paying support to your double.</i>

844
00:59:29,166 --> 00:59:30,567
<i>- The double.
- Of course.</i>

845
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:32,202
For another month?

846
00:59:32,702 --> 00:59:34,671
I spent everything
I had yesterday.

847
00:59:34,704 --> 00:59:36,339
<i>On what?</i>

848
00:59:36,706 --> 00:59:39,176
An outfit for the duel.

849
00:59:40,677 --> 00:59:42,245
<i>If you default on your payments,</i>

850
00:59:42,279 --> 00:59:44,147
<i>the court will
assign you a handicap.</i>

851
00:59:44,181 --> 00:59:45,758
<i>Such as having to duel with one
arm tied behind your back.</i>

852
00:59:45,782 --> 00:59:47,417
I'll figure something out.

853
00:59:47,451 --> 00:59:49,219
<i>The double has won the duel.</i>

854
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:50,587
<i>Goodbye, Sarah.</i>

855
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:52,422
<i>He's Robert Michaels now.</i>

856
00:59:57,327 --> 00:59:58,662
How have you been?

857
00:59:59,529 --> 01:00:00,664
Good.

858
01:00:01,698 --> 01:00:04,100
I started a new job recently.

859
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:05,469
Hey.

860
01:00:05,502 --> 01:00:07,103
Do you like it?

861
01:00:08,405 --> 01:00:09,706
I think I do.

862
01:00:10,474 --> 01:00:12,142
I don't know yet.

863
01:00:15,245 --> 01:00:17,214
- How are you?
- I'm okay.

864
01:00:17,714 --> 01:00:20,183
They postponed the duel,
as I'm sure you're aware.

865
01:00:20,217 --> 01:00:21,618
I am.

866
01:00:21,651 --> 01:00:23,687
She doesn't talk about
the duel all that much.

867
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:28,158
I was surprised
you wanted to meet up.

868
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:32,095
It felt like it was time.

869
01:00:34,498 --> 01:00:38,502
I want to apologize
for how things ended.

870
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:43,206
I know I said some
really hurtful things there.

871
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:46,309
I understand.

872
01:00:46,343 --> 01:00:48,278
I took it as you trying
to push me away.

873
01:00:49,779 --> 01:00:52,415
I wanted to see you
and tell you I don't hate you.

874
01:00:53,250 --> 01:00:55,619
I wouldn't want to die
with you thinking I hated you.

875
01:00:58,388 --> 01:01:00,223
I appreciate you saying that.

876
01:01:02,491 --> 01:01:04,693
I'm going to try my best
to kill her, though.

877
01:01:06,662 --> 01:01:08,664
And I won't be sorry for it.

878
01:01:09,665 --> 01:01:11,467
I need you to know that.

879
01:01:13,469 --> 01:01:14,670
I know.

880
01:01:17,606 --> 01:01:19,508
Should we order
something to eat?

881
01:01:22,311 --> 01:01:23,612
I think that would be nice.

882
01:01:32,555 --> 01:01:35,291
Hi, Trent.
The duel has been postponed.

883
01:01:35,324 --> 01:01:37,626
Can I keep training with you
for another month?

884
01:01:39,628 --> 01:01:41,430
Uh, well, I was wondering...

885
01:01:43,265 --> 01:01:44,844
you know how you were
talking about other forms

886
01:01:44,868 --> 01:01:47,469
of payment
that were mutually beneficial?

887
01:01:47,503 --> 01:01:49,672
Does that offer still stand?

888
01:02:07,690 --> 01:02:10,392

Don't get frustrated.

01:02:33,349 --> 01:02:37,553
Let's do it slower.
Five, six, seven, eight.

899
01:02:41,624 --> 01:02:43,325
Yes, better.

900
01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:44,603
Okay, let's do
it from the start.

901
01:02:44,627 --> 01:02:45,661
Thank you.

910
01:03:09,385 --> 01:03:11,854
Thank you again for
the hip-hop dance lessons.

911
01:03:11,888 --> 01:03:14,523
I've wanted to take classes
for three years now,

912
01:03:14,556 --> 01:03:16,659
but I've been too
nervous to start.

913
01:03:16,926 --> 01:03:19,695
I hope you continue dancing
even if I die in my duel.

914
01:03:20,663 --> 01:03:22,765
I've already signed up
for a beginner group class.

915
01:03:22,798 --> 01:03:24,500
Oh, that's good.

916
01:03:24,533 --> 01:03:26,735
I know this isn't ideal
for you to wait

917
01:03:26,769 --> 01:03:29,505
another month to duel
your double to the death,

918
01:03:29,538 --> 01:03:31,540
but look at it as
an opportunity.

919
01:03:31,573 --> 01:03:32,976
Try to see the positives.

920
01:03:33,009 --> 01:03:35,644
Another month means
another month of training.

921
01:03:35,945 --> 01:03:37,579
Do you see this dog here?

922
01:03:38,948 --> 01:03:40,649
The one here on the leash?

923
01:03:40,683 --> 01:03:42,584
Hm, his name is Connor.

924
01:03:43,619 --> 01:03:45,454
I named him after
my grandfather.

925
01:03:45,487 --> 01:03:47,690
- He's your dog?
- He is.

926
01:03:47,723 --> 01:03:50,392
Aw. He looks friendly.

927
01:03:50,659 --> 01:03:52,494
Do you see that crossbow there?

928
01:03:52,528 --> 01:03:54,430
- That one?
- Yes.

929
01:03:54,463 --> 01:03:55,698
Grab it.

930
01:04:01,836 --> 01:04:03,538
Stand over there.

931
01:04:08,843 --> 01:04:10,611
Shoot my dog.

932
01:04:14,849 --> 01:04:15,918
Why?

933
01:04:16,551 --> 01:04:19,353
Connor is very old
and very sick.

934
01:04:22,457 --> 01:04:23,825
I don't want to.

935
01:04:24,893 --> 01:04:27,428
It's okay. He's suffering.

936
01:04:27,896 --> 01:04:30,565
He's in an immense
amount of pain.

937
01:04:34,769 --> 01:04:36,804
You'll be putting him
out of his misery.

938
01:04:45,580 --> 01:04:46,915
Do it, Sarah.

939
01:04:48,483 --> 01:04:49,584
Please.

940
01:04:52,487 --> 01:04:53,755
He's in agony.

941
01:05:03,698 --> 01:05:04,900
I can't.

942
01:05:06,768 --> 01:05:08,569
I understand.

943
01:05:08,904 --> 01:05:11,606
I'm disappointed
in your killer instincts.

944
01:05:12,941 --> 01:05:14,675
But...

945
01:05:14,709 --> 01:05:17,012
at least my dog is still alive.

946
01:05:28,856 --> 01:05:30,625
What the fuck, Sarah?!

947
01:05:40,635 --> 01:05:41,870
I'm sorry.

948
01:06:17,839 --> 01:06:18,974
Hi.

949
01:06:19,942 --> 01:06:20,976
Hi.

950
01:06:21,843 --> 01:06:23,477
Did you lose her?

951
01:06:26,647 --> 01:06:28,083
Did you lose your twin?

952
01:06:30,718 --> 01:06:33,554
Yes. I can't find
my twin sister.

953
01:06:33,588 --> 01:06:35,656
She looks exactly like me
because we're twins,

954
01:06:35,690 --> 01:06:36,791
just like you two.

955
01:06:36,824 --> 01:06:37,960
Have you seen her?

956
01:06:37,993 --> 01:06:39,627
She's over here.

957
01:07:00,780 --> 01:07:02,849
You don't have
to be scared anymore.

958
01:07:02,884 --> 01:07:04,784
We found your sister.

959
01:07:05,887 --> 01:07:07,989
When I and Abby
were really small,

960
01:07:08,022 --> 01:07:09,991
and we went to the store
with Mommy,

961
01:07:10,024 --> 01:07:13,560
and a man came up
and wanted to show Abby a toy.

962
01:07:13,961 --> 01:07:17,597
I wanted to see the toy, too,
but the man said

963
01:07:17,631 --> 01:07:19,967
that if both of us
would be looking at the toy,

964
01:07:20,001 --> 01:07:22,937
Mommy could get scared
that where are we.

965
01:07:23,570 --> 01:07:26,874
When Mommy came back,
I told her about the man,

966
01:07:26,908 --> 01:07:29,010
but Abby was gone.

967
01:07:29,043 --> 01:07:31,611
Abby didn't come for three days,

968
01:07:31,645 --> 01:07:34,081
and they found her in
a parking lot.

969
01:07:34,115 --> 01:07:37,018
I missed her terribly much,
and I cried a lot,

970
01:07:37,051 --> 01:07:39,653
but now,
we are all the time together,

971
01:07:39,686 --> 01:07:43,157
except when she goes to talk
to Miss Murphy every Sunday.

972
01:07:43,190 --> 01:07:46,860
But your sister is here,
and she loves you very much.

973
01:07:47,094 --> 01:07:48,762
Girls!

974
01:07:48,795 --> 01:07:50,998
Who are you? Let go of her.

975
01:07:51,032 --> 01:07:52,766
- Sorry.
- Mommy.

976
01:07:52,799 --> 01:07:55,769
She asked us to help
to find her twin sister.

977
01:07:55,802 --> 01:07:57,171
I think you should leave.

978
01:07:57,204 --> 01:07:58,738
Come on.

979
01:08:05,980 --> 01:08:07,647
I know you're in there.

980
01:08:07,681 --> 01:08:10,650
You're going
to try and murder me.

981
01:08:10,684 --> 01:08:12,585
Look, I realize I shot at you.

982
01:08:12,619 --> 01:08:15,722
I've been training for a year
to kill you. It was instinctual.

983
01:08:15,957 --> 01:08:18,792
You surprised me.
What else would you expect?

984
01:08:18,825 --> 01:08:20,660
We're supposed
to wait until the duel.

985
01:08:20,694 --> 01:08:22,729
I know. Open the door.

986
01:08:23,164 --> 01:08:25,632
I promise I won't
try to murder you.

987
01:08:27,701 --> 01:08:29,136
Okay.

988
01:08:46,686 --> 01:08:49,723
You almost got me,
even through the glass.

989
01:08:50,657 --> 01:08:53,160
I'm surprised I missed,
even through the glass.

990
01:08:53,194 --> 01:08:54,929
I'm agile.

991
01:08:55,997 --> 01:08:57,697
Can I ask you something?

992
01:09:00,134 --> 01:09:01,134
Sure.

993
01:09:02,069 --> 01:09:04,905
When we first met,
all those months ago

994
01:09:04,939 --> 01:09:07,141
when I shook your hand,

995
01:09:07,174 --> 01:09:08,909
why didn't you
look me in the eye?

996
01:09:11,145 --> 01:09:13,114
I'm not sure.

997
01:09:13,147 --> 01:09:15,648
I think it was because
I knew what was going to happen.

998
01:09:15,682 --> 01:09:17,817
I mean, I knew I was going
to take over eventually,

999
01:09:17,851 --> 01:09:19,753
and I think I felt
a sense of guilt.

1000
01:09:19,954 --> 01:09:22,756
Taking over my life
was the plan, not stealing it.

1001
01:09:22,789 --> 01:09:25,259
I understand you feel that I
stole it, but it's my life, too.

1002
01:09:25,292 --> 01:09:26,927
But it was my life first.

1003
01:09:26,961 --> 01:09:28,771
Yes, but that doesn't mean
my life matters any less.

1004
01:09:28,795 --> 01:09:30,797
- But your life is my life.
- It was your life,

1005
01:09:30,830 --> 01:09:32,867
but I've moved past your life
and made it my own.

1006
01:09:32,900 --> 01:09:34,911
Yes, but you knowingly stole
everything that made up my life

1007
01:09:34,935 --> 01:09:36,237
to make up yours.

1008
01:09:37,537 --> 01:09:39,978
I understand that you feel like
I went about it the wrong way.

1009
01:09:40,740 --> 01:09:43,141
And to be honest, it's not what
I thought it would be anyway.

1010
01:09:44,311 --> 01:09:46,213
What do you mean?

1011
01:09:46,247 --> 01:09:50,083
Well, Peter and I argue about
the littlest things sometimes.

1012
01:09:50,116 --> 01:09:52,052
For example, last week,
I wanted to watch

1013
01:09:52,085 --> 01:09:54,686
a romantic comedy, and he wanted
to watch a dark comedy.

1014
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:56,755
How can I be with someone
if we can't even agree

1015
01:09:56,789 --> 01:09:58,724
on the genre of film
we should watch?

1016
01:09:58,992 --> 01:10:02,062
Or take our mother.
She acts like I owe her my life.

1017
01:10:02,295 --> 01:10:03,963
Phone calls, just to talk.

1018
01:10:03,997 --> 01:10:05,899
Texts asking me, "How are you?"

1019
01:10:05,932 --> 01:10:08,268
One before 9:00 A.M. saying,
"I love you very much."

1020
01:10:08,834 --> 01:10:10,913
And don't even get me started
on the amount of forwarded

1021
01:10:10,937 --> 01:10:13,039
social media posts
that are only moderately funny.

1022
01:10:13,073 --> 01:10:15,875
They already have a day for
mothers. Isn't that enough?

1023
01:10:17,077 --> 01:10:18,844
What are you trying to say?

1024
01:10:20,180 --> 01:10:21,915
I'm still not sure.

1025
01:10:22,882 --> 01:10:24,350
It's your life now.

1026
01:10:24,951 --> 01:10:26,953
I've moved on,
and I'm making a new one.

1027
01:10:30,323 --> 01:10:32,292
I'm still going
to kill you in the duel.

1028
01:10:32,959 --> 01:10:34,928
But I'll make it quicker
and less painful

1029
01:10:34,961 --> 01:10:36,296
than I had originally planned.

1030
01:10:38,064 --> 01:10:39,899
I want to take you somewhere.

1031
01:10:41,834 --> 01:10:42,936
Where?

1032
01:10:52,178 --> 01:10:53,913
We're a little late.

1033
01:10:55,781 --> 01:10:57,984
I pushed him and he fell over.

1034
01:10:58,985 --> 01:11:01,387
He held up his hands
as a shield.

1035
01:11:02,355 --> 01:11:05,024
I will never forget
the screams he made.

1036
01:11:05,058 --> 01:11:06,392
Sorry.

1037
01:11:06,426 --> 01:11:09,028
That's all right.
Please come take a seat.

1038
01:11:12,065 --> 01:11:14,868
Carl had just started to tell us
about how he's been feeling.

1039
01:11:15,268 --> 01:11:17,003
Since his duel.

1040
01:11:19,038 --> 01:11:21,307
I can't remember
exactly where I was.

1041
01:11:22,208 --> 01:11:24,776
My memory isn't
what it used to be.

1042
01:11:25,879 --> 01:11:28,714
In the moment, shooting
my double in the face

1043
01:11:28,747 --> 01:11:30,849
didn't make me feel bad.

1044
01:11:31,384 --> 01:11:34,020
I knew it was him or me.

1045
01:11:35,421 --> 01:11:37,257
Seeing his brain on that grass

1046
01:11:37,290 --> 01:11:40,326
meant that I was going
to get to spend more time

1047
01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:42,794
with my children
and grandchildren.

1048
01:11:44,364 --> 01:11:46,399
It's been three years.

1049
01:11:47,867 --> 01:11:50,136
But I still wake up
from nightmares.

1050
01:11:50,436 --> 01:11:52,205
I cry in my sleep.

1051
01:11:52,872 --> 01:11:55,875
That's why my wife
sleeps on the couch.

1052
01:11:57,310 --> 01:11:59,811
She can't stand
to see me this way.

1053
01:12:01,915 --> 01:12:04,184
Sometimes I wonder,

1054
01:12:04,217 --> 01:12:08,321
what was the point
of fighting to live...

1055
01:12:08,354 --> 01:12:10,822
if this is the life I'm living?

1056
01:12:16,029 --> 01:12:17,430
Nice try.

1057
01:12:17,463 --> 01:12:19,966
Your mental tricks
aren't going to work on me.

1058
01:12:19,999 --> 01:12:21,833
Nothing you do or say

1059
01:12:21,868 --> 01:12:24,103
or he does or says
or they do or say

1060
01:12:24,137 --> 01:12:26,406
is going to keep me
from surviving this whole mess.

1061
01:12:26,439 --> 01:12:28,174
It's not like that.

1062
01:12:28,208 --> 01:12:30,443
Believe me when I say that
I'm going to do my very best

1063
01:12:30,476 --> 01:12:32,178
to kill you, too.

1064
01:12:32,212 --> 01:12:34,948
Just like I've also
definitely been training to do.

1065
01:12:34,981 --> 01:12:36,425
I just wanted you
to see people like us

1066
01:12:36,449 --> 01:12:38,117
and hear their experiences.

1067
01:12:38,885 --> 01:12:40,987
Whichever one of us lives
is going to have to

1068
01:12:41,020 --> 01:12:43,889
live with this
for the rest of our life.

1069
01:12:43,922 --> 01:12:46,191
Your double's name
is Sarah's Double,

1070
01:12:46,225 --> 01:12:48,260
so I can only assume
your name is Sarah.

1071
01:12:48,961 --> 01:12:50,929
I'm Daryl, the group leader.

1072
01:12:50,963 --> 01:12:53,298
I'm responsible for starting
the check-in process,

1073
01:12:53,332 --> 01:12:55,968
and I ensure individuals
stay on topic.

1074
01:12:57,469 --> 01:13:00,472
I also introduce the arts and
crafts activity of the meeting.

1075
01:13:00,505 --> 01:13:02,407
Perhaps we should
move along to that.

1076
01:13:10,515 --> 01:13:13,318
Everyone raise
their non-dominant hand.

1077
01:13:17,256 --> 01:13:19,491
I want you to use this hand
to compose a letter

1078
01:13:19,524 --> 01:13:21,460
to your original,
or to your double,

1079
01:13:21,493 --> 01:13:23,929
depending on which one you are.

1080
01:13:24,129 --> 01:13:26,498
This is to help you connect
to a part of you that

1081
01:13:26,531 --> 01:13:28,567
could also feel like it belongs
to another person

1082
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:30,302
at the same time.

1083
01:13:31,203 --> 01:13:33,472
You see where
I'm going with this?

1084
01:13:59,364 --> 01:14:03,335
"I had only two days
of imprintation with you.

1085
01:14:04,569 --> 01:14:07,005
"You let me discover
your lifeless body

1086
01:14:07,039 --> 01:14:10,075
in a bath of red,
lukewarm water."

1087
01:14:11,376 --> 01:14:15,280
"I didn't know how to be you.
I still don't."

1088
01:14:16,448 --> 01:14:19,284
"I don't like the people
you forced me to live with.

1089
01:14:19,318 --> 01:14:21,086
It makes me depressed."

1090
01:14:22,321 --> 01:14:24,389
"I want to kill myself, too."

1091
01:14:24,423 --> 01:14:28,393
"But we all know there cannot be
doubles of doubles."

1092
01:14:29,594 --> 01:14:32,197
"And even though
I didn't choose to be made,

1093
01:14:32,230 --> 01:14:36,168
I don't want to let anyone down
like you did."

1094
01:14:39,438 --> 01:14:42,174
"Best...

1095
01:14:42,207 --> 01:14:43,308
Larry."

1096
01:14:58,123 --> 01:15:01,059
"Most people would look down
upon what we had,

1097
01:15:01,093 --> 01:15:03,495
but it was better than anything
they will ever know.

1098
01:15:04,629 --> 01:15:07,099
We knew each other
intrinsically.

1099
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:11,470
Better than if you knew
someone else an entire lifetime.

1100
01:15:13,105 --> 01:15:14,539
I still miss your touch.

1101
01:15:16,508 --> 01:15:18,276
"I'm sorry you had to die."

1102
01:15:27,119 --> 01:15:28,620
I would like to go next.

1103
01:15:30,489 --> 01:15:31,623
"Sarah..."

1104
01:15:33,392 --> 01:15:37,028
What you said in there,
I'm still at a loss.

1105
01:15:38,596 --> 01:15:41,298
I mean, the way you eloquently
accepted all the blame.

1106
01:15:41,332 --> 01:15:43,367
The way you effectively argued
that the real enemy

1107
01:15:43,401 --> 01:15:45,269
isn't each other.

1108
01:15:45,302 --> 01:15:47,247
It's a system that arbitrarily
decides only one of us can live

1109
01:15:47,271 --> 01:15:49,039
and that has us
fight to the death

1110
01:15:49,073 --> 01:15:51,342
as some sort of sick
spectator sport.

1111
01:15:51,675 --> 01:15:54,278
I'm sure you wrote something
similar in your letter.

1112
01:15:54,311 --> 01:15:56,113
Maybe you'll read it
for me someday.

1113
01:15:56,647 --> 01:15:58,048
Yeah.

1114
01:15:58,416 --> 01:15:59,650
And you're right,

1115
01:15:59,683 --> 01:16:02,253
we actually have
a lot in common.

1116
01:16:02,286 --> 01:16:04,388
A lot, like being
good at swimming,

1117
01:16:04,422 --> 01:16:06,123
and we both have great breasts.

1118
01:16:06,157 --> 01:16:07,391
Exactly.

1119
01:16:08,159 --> 01:16:09,593
Why should one of
us have to die?

1120
01:16:09,627 --> 01:16:11,429
Why can't we be together?

1121
01:16:11,462 --> 01:16:13,507
I'm not saying we should fuck
like that one guy in there

1122
01:16:13,531 --> 01:16:17,134
obviously did with his double,
but why can't we both live?

1123
01:16:18,702 --> 01:16:20,404
Do you mean that?

1124
01:17:27,371 --> 01:17:29,206
I'm glad you know how to drive.

1125
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:30,474
I never learned.

1126
01:17:30,508 --> 01:17:32,476
It seems easy enough, though.

1127
01:17:32,510 --> 01:17:34,478
You just press forward
on the right one,

1128
01:17:34,512 --> 01:17:36,380
and you stop by pulling it back.

1129
01:17:36,413 --> 01:17:38,616
No, you press the pedal
to the left of it to brake.

1130
01:17:38,649 --> 01:17:40,684
Huh. That makes sense.

1131
01:17:44,755 --> 01:17:47,291
And you change directions
with that round thing.

1132
01:17:47,324 --> 01:17:49,493
Turning it to the right
makes the car go right,

1133
01:17:49,527 --> 01:17:51,795
and turning it to the left
makes it go left.

1134
01:17:53,464 --> 01:17:56,433
See. Easy enough.

1135
01:18:15,486 --> 01:18:16,654
Comfortable clothing?

1136
01:18:18,689 --> 01:18:21,692
- Check.
- Backpacks?

1137
01:18:23,594 --> 01:18:25,396
Yours is smaller than
I was expecting.

1138
01:18:25,429 --> 01:18:27,364
I have everything I need.

1139
01:18:28,232 --> 01:18:29,633
Check.

1140
01:18:29,667 --> 01:18:31,802
- No weapons?
- None.

1141
01:18:31,835 --> 01:18:33,536
I didn't bring any either.

1142
01:18:33,570 --> 01:18:34,881
If it's all right with you,
I'd like to make sure

1143
01:18:34,905 --> 01:18:36,539
you didn't bring any.

1144
01:18:36,573 --> 01:18:38,183
I don't want to do it here
on the side of the road.

1145
01:18:38,207 --> 01:18:39,709
Maybe when we take
our first break?

1146
01:18:39,742 --> 01:18:41,444
That's fine with me.

1147
01:18:41,477 --> 01:18:43,222
I'd like to check your pack,
too, for peace of mind.

1148
01:18:43,246 --> 01:18:44,814
Of course.

1149
01:18:44,847 --> 01:18:46,816
Rations, check.

1150
01:18:46,849 --> 01:18:48,351
And water.

1151
01:18:49,586 --> 01:18:51,454
Yes, last on the list is water.

1152
01:18:51,487 --> 01:18:52,822
I have it. Check.

1153
01:18:52,855 --> 01:18:54,857
Let's drink some
before we begin walking.

1154
01:18:58,528 --> 01:19:00,330
I don't think I have
to remind you

1155
01:19:00,363 --> 01:19:01,865
of the importance of
staying hydrated.

1156
01:19:10,807 --> 01:19:13,376
Let's take another
bigger drink just to be safe.

1157
01:20:42,699 --> 01:20:44,767
Thank you.

1158
01:20:59,816 --> 01:21:01,384
I wonder what will happen

1159
01:21:01,417 --> 01:21:02,828
when we both don't show up
for the duel.

1160
01:21:02,852 --> 01:21:04,554
One of the combatants in a duel

1161
01:21:04,587 --> 01:21:06,456
has failed to show up
before out of fear,

1162
01:21:06,489 --> 01:21:08,591
but they're almost always
later found and arrested.

1163
01:21:09,392 --> 01:21:11,570
Some try to get plastic surgery
in order to look different,

1164
01:21:11,594 --> 01:21:13,563
but I found out from Trent
that once we're a part

1165
01:21:13,596 --> 01:21:15,507
of the replacement program,
any attempts to contact

1166
01:21:15,531 --> 01:21:17,266
a plastic surgeon are flagged.

1167
01:21:17,300 --> 01:21:19,278
There's always the black-market,
though, but you are taking

1168
01:21:19,302 --> 01:21:22,371
a big risk getting
a black-market face transplant.

1169
01:21:22,405 --> 01:21:24,440
As far as I know,
there has never been a duel

1170
01:21:24,474 --> 01:21:26,776
where both the original
and the double are no-shows.

1171
01:21:28,511 --> 01:21:29,979
They'll send dogs after us.

1172
01:21:30,746 --> 01:21:32,614
But we'll be across
the border by then.

1173
01:21:32,982 --> 01:21:35,417
Once we cross the border,
we'll be safe.

1174
01:21:37,019 --> 01:21:39,688
I'm incredibly thankful
you came and found me.

1175
01:21:39,721 --> 01:21:42,491
And to think, just a few
weeks ago, I wanted you dead.

1176
01:21:42,524 --> 01:21:44,559
I'm so glad we're both
in such good shape.

1177
01:21:44,593 --> 01:21:46,004
We would have needed
many more rests already

1178
01:21:46,028 --> 01:21:47,997
had we not been training
this past year.

1179
01:21:59,775 --> 01:22:01,510
Yes.

1180
01:22:01,543 --> 01:22:02,844
I agree.

1181
01:23:47,849 --> 01:23:49,018
Sorry I'm late.

1182
01:23:49,051 --> 01:23:50,785
Which one are you?

1183
01:23:50,819 --> 01:23:53,122
The original, Sarah.

1184
01:23:53,155 --> 01:23:55,024
Where have you been?

1185
01:23:55,757 --> 01:23:57,592
I had a little car trouble.

1186
01:23:57,994 --> 01:23:59,862
What kind of car trouble?

1187
01:24:00,729 --> 01:24:03,141
I accidentally mistook the wheel
that turns the car right or left

1188
01:24:03,165 --> 01:24:04,833
for the pedal
that stops the car.

1189
01:24:04,867 --> 01:24:06,801
I'm fine. Should we begin?

1190
01:24:07,602 --> 01:24:08,803
We can't start yet.

1191
01:24:08,837 --> 01:24:10,139
Why not?

1192
01:24:10,172 --> 01:24:11,908
Because your double isn't here.

1193
01:24:11,941 --> 01:24:13,175
Really?

1194
01:24:13,209 --> 01:24:14,877
Actually, that sounds
just like her.

1195
01:24:14,911 --> 01:24:16,711
She didn't take this duel
very seriously.

1196
01:24:16,745 --> 01:24:18,156
I bet she hasn't even
been training for it.

1197
01:24:18,180 --> 01:24:20,016
You should probably
let your superiors know.

1198
01:24:20,049 --> 01:24:21,716
She's likely trying to flee.

1199
01:24:25,719 --> 01:24:26,719
Yes?

1200
01:24:28,123 --> 01:24:30,758
I'm afraid not, ma'am.
Just the original.

1201
01:24:32,660 --> 01:24:35,663
I have reason to believe
this is a code negative one.

1202
01:25:34,722 --> 01:25:38,093
And do you, sir, swear that,
to the best of your knowledge,

1203
01:25:38,126 --> 01:25:41,829
having known her
emotionally and intimately,

1204
01:25:41,863 --> 01:25:43,898
that this is the original Sarah?

1205
01:25:46,734 --> 01:25:47,801
I do.

1206
01:25:48,937 --> 01:25:51,940
And do you swear
beyond the shadow of any

1207
01:25:51,973 --> 01:25:54,943
reasonable doubt
that the person before us today

1208
01:25:54,976 --> 01:25:58,013
is the daughter that gestated
inside you for nine months

1209
01:25:58,046 --> 01:26:02,050
and you raised for 18 years,
your own flesh and blood?

1210
01:26:02,283 --> 01:26:04,718
This is my Sarah, Your Honor.

1211
01:26:04,752 --> 01:26:08,089
And, finally,
do you solemnly swear

1212
01:26:08,123 --> 01:26:10,791
that you are
who you say you are?

1213
01:26:12,961 --> 01:26:14,195
I'm Sarah.

1214
01:26:19,267 --> 01:26:22,070
I think I have a new wrinkle
and two new sunspots.

1215
01:26:22,103 --> 01:26:23,304
I'm sure you don't.

1216
01:26:23,338 --> 01:26:25,173
I can count, Peter.

1217
01:26:25,206 --> 01:26:28,243
There's exactly one new wrinkle
on my face and two new sunspots.

1218
01:26:34,315 --> 01:26:36,784
Well, you have to start
using sunscreen.

1219
01:26:36,817 --> 01:26:38,887
And not just when
you're going to the beach

1220
01:26:38,920 --> 01:26:40,197
or when you're
walking around a theme park.

1221
01:26:40,221 --> 01:26:41,755
It has to be daily.

1222
01:26:41,789 --> 01:26:44,025
Your skin is more
sensitive than others'.

1223
01:26:45,826 --> 01:26:48,296
And you have to start
taking better care of yourself.

1224
01:26:48,329 --> 01:26:50,999
I don't mean to sound
insensitive, but...

1225
01:26:51,032 --> 01:26:53,301
it's only going to get
a lot harder from here.

1226
01:26:54,269 --> 01:26:56,304
As long as men take
moderate care of themselves,

1227
01:26:56,337 --> 01:26:58,106
they tend to peak later in life.

1228
01:26:58,139 --> 01:27:00,208
Women, on the other hand,
have a much smaller window

1229
01:27:00,241 --> 01:27:03,211
in which they're deemed to be
at their peak attractiveness.

1230
01:27:04,212 --> 01:27:05,980
And don't worry, sweetheart,

1231
01:27:06,014 --> 01:27:08,116
I'm gonna love you
no matter how you look,

1232
01:27:08,149 --> 01:27:09,918
even with that genetic mutation

1233
01:27:09,951 --> 01:27:12,120
that causes premature
graying and hair loss.

1234
01:27:13,154 --> 01:27:15,323
Should I buy more hair dye
for you while I'm out?

1235
01:27:17,092 --> 01:27:19,993
No, I'll get some
on my way home from work.

1236
01:27:24,031 --> 01:27:26,100
Remember to keep making
at least the minimum payment

1237
01:27:26,133 --> 01:27:27,301
on the replacement loan.

1238
01:27:27,334 --> 01:27:28,936
I know, Peter.

1239
01:27:33,107 --> 01:27:34,875
Where should we go
for dinner tonight?

1240
01:27:36,076 --> 01:27:37,810
How about Mexican food?

1241
01:27:40,147 --> 01:27:42,216
I don't like Mexican food.

1242
01:27:55,863 --> 01:27:57,297
Aren't you going to answer that?

1243
01:27:59,099 --> 01:28:01,034
She's my mom, not yours.

1244
01:28:02,402 --> 01:28:04,171
<i>Hi, Sarah.</i>

1245
01:28:04,204 --> 01:28:06,874
<i>This is your mother
just calling to talk.</i>

1246
01:28:06,907 --> 01:28:09,042
<i>I must have just missed you.</i>

1247
01:28:09,809 --> 01:28:13,046
<i>You're probably just walking
out the door of your house...</i>

1248
01:28:14,847 --> 01:28:16,350
<i>getting into your car,</i>

1249
01:28:16,383 --> 01:28:19,153
<i>ready to start another
day at your job,</i>

1250
01:28:19,186 --> 01:28:20,888
<i>which you love.</i>

1251
01:28:22,256 --> 01:28:24,857
<i>I just wanted you to know,
I went ahead and ordered</i>

1252
01:28:24,892 --> 01:28:27,327
<i>another box of contacts
from the optometrist.</i>

1253
01:28:28,228 --> 01:28:30,864
<i>The colored ones
aren't always in stock,</i>

1254
01:28:30,898 --> 01:28:33,066
<i>so it's best to
order ahead of time.</i>

1255
01:28:33,934 --> 01:28:37,004
<i>I know you're still getting
settled back into your life,</i>

1256
01:28:37,037 --> 01:28:39,805
<i>so I figured something
as simple as new contacts</i>

1257
01:28:39,839 --> 01:28:42,009
<i>might slip through the cracks.</i>

1258
01:28:42,042 --> 01:28:44,077
<i>I'll call you when
you get off work</i>

1259
01:28:44,111 --> 01:28:47,080
<i>so we can plan a brunch
for this weekend.</i>

1260
01:28:47,114 --> 01:28:49,016
<i>I love you.</i>
