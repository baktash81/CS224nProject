1
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:56,157
Damn!The chicken is gone!
Get her,mister!

2
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:26,730
If the picture is good
I will work in a newspaper.

3
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:32,736
You are playing with your life
for a photrograph?

4
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:36,531
Do you think that i am in the mood
to see the fucking gang?

5
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,869
The chicken bro!

6
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:47,709
The chicken i told you,asshole!

7
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,379
Get the chicken!

8
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,193
If Ze gets you,
you're dead.

9
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:16,696
He has to find me first.

10
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:28,792
Hey,kid!Get the chicken!

11
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:35,674
-The cops!
-Don't run!

12
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:43,348
Butthead! Mothefucker!

13
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:47,227
A photo might
have changed my life. . .

14
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,271
but in the City of God,
if you run you're dead. . .

15
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,816
...if you stay,
you're dead again.

16
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:57,862
It has always been like that
since i was a kid.

17
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:04,077
IN THE 60's

18
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:15,005
-You are so useless.
-Fetch the ball.

19
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:21,594
Hey, kid! Fetch the ball .

20
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:27,642
you are not giving it to me?

21
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:32,105
Fuck you.
What's your name?

22
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:35,608
Sorry,I forgot to introduce myself.

23
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,068
My name is Rocket.

24
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:41,740
Do not give the ball
to the kid,he stinks.

25
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,660
This is Hairy.

26
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:49,998
The story of the City of God
starts with him.

27
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:58,590
However, Hairy's story
is connected to Mortes Trio story.

28
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:04,012
The truck is comming.
Why are you fooling around?

29
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:11,603
TRIO MORTES STORY

30
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,112
Trio Mortes
the legend of the City of God!

31
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,322
Hairy.

32
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:24,699
Snatcher.

33
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,993
And Naive.

34
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:34,167
With them,Kid and
Benny,Hairy's brother .

35
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:39,714
I did not have enough courage
to go with my brother.

36
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:50,058
Come Naive!

37
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:52,310
Let's go!

38
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:14,457
Stop or I'll shoot,
fucking asshole.

39
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:16,668
Get out!

40
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:23,049
Quickly,asshole.
Give me the money!

41
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:27,137
Who wants gass?

42
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:38,440
Oh!You wanna die for money
that is not yours?

43
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:40,817
Lots of money here!

44
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:48,158
Damn!The cops!

45
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:02,172
Quickly!
They are everywhere!

46
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:34,245
Then, i thought that
Trio Mortes. . .

47
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:37,123
was the toughest gang 
in Rio.

48
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:44,255
But they were just amateurs.

49
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:50,303
Even my bro
Naive.

50
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:55,892
Give these to dad
but do not tell him it's from me.

51
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:02,232
Hairy, come and see what I've got!

52
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:24,379
We came to the City of God
to find paradise.

53
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:28,133
Lot of people were homeless
due to the floods...

54
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:32,387
and the fire
they set on ghetto.

55
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:35,640
They are going to bring electricity!

56
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:40,770
The big bosses however
didn't like the homeless.

57
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:45,358
Without electricity,without
roads,without busses.

58
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:49,446
The rich people...
They don't give a damn about us

59
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:54,075
It has nothing to do
with the Rio De Janeiro you see in postcards.

60
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:14,012
Do you think i am going to be
a lifeguard when i grow up?

61
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:15,347
I don't know.

62
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,975
It is better to be a
lifeguard than a fisherman.

63
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:21,603
I don't want to be a fisherman,
I will stink.

64
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:24,689
-Are you insulting your father?
-No.

65
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:28,234
-What do you want to become?

66
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:33,031
I sure don't want to be a gangster
or a cop.

67
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:35,950
I do not want to get killed.

68
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:43,124
Drop it,Kid.

69
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:47,462
Are you pointing a gun at me?

70
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:49,839
The kid is with me.

71
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:53,551
I am a gangster too.

72
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:58,723
-Not many bottles in it.
-We rob trucks every day.

73
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:05,563
We have to hit a rich
house to get out of here.

74
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:09,567
No, you have to
follow my plan .

75
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:13,738
Look who's talking!

76
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:24,332
He is so stoned, he
doesn't know what he is talking about!

77
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:29,045
You are both not as
worthy as the kid.

78
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:34,592
What are you thinking,Kid?

79
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:39,472
The gun doesn't make you a robber.
You need ideas.

80
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:43,977
The kid had ideas.

81
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:48,815
Is this the Motel?

82
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:53,403
We get the money and leave.
No killings!

83
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:57,240
-Give it to me.
-Leave me alone!

84
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:02,412
Don't you give this
shit to me!

85
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:04,873
You're acting like a baby.

86
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:08,209
-Here's yours.
-Awesome!

87
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:17,302
Do not be hasty.You're staying here
to look out.

88
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,347
If you see cops,
shoot that window.

89
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,474
Why doesn't he stay in the look-out?

90
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:26,853
This was my plan.
He is good for nothing!

91
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:31,816
Ok,you had the idea.
But you're just a kid!

92
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:35,070
Cover us.

93
00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:41,284
Your turn is going to come.
Don't be so hasty.

94
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:43,828
Stay here.

95
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,794
This is a hold up, bitch .

96
00:11:55,632 --> 00:12:00,220
You should be at school
or at work.

97
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:06,309
You do not look like robbers.

98
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:08,478
Shut up,bitch!

99
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,814
Ok,Snatcher?

100
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:14,609
Are we going in?

101
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:25,036
-I did not order anything.
-It's on the house!Your money!

102
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:29,833
Take it easy.All I want is your money.

103
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:47,100
Hey, pal!
What is this mess?

104
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:52,355
Are you a church boy?

105
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:57,110
Give it to me!

106
00:13:01,031 --> 00:13:03,450
You are old,and ugly.

107
00:13:04,034 --> 00:13:06,077
Do you want to fuck her?

108
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:16,629
Police!Let's beat it!

109
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:24,888
Take the car.
I'm gonna bring the kid.

110
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:39,319
-It went wrong.The kid is missing!
-They are shooting,let's go!

111
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:11,393
-You said you could drive.
-I can,cool down.

112
00:14:14,145 --> 00:14:16,231
Turn!Watch it!

113
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:32,455
-You asshole!
-I didn't do it on purpose.

114
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:38,044
Noone saw a thing.
Don't say a word,ok?

115
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:43,800
I twisted my leg!

116
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,512
-Naive is hit!
-It hurts!

117
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:51,641
Take him to the woods.
I will try to distract the cops.

118
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:54,019
God help us.

119
00:14:59,941 --> 00:15:01,484
Get the phone.

120
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:08,074
Shortie.Infamous in the City.
I will talk about him later.

121
00:15:10,702 --> 00:15:13,163
It hurts, God damnit!

122
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:17,751
Shut up!
You're acting like a sissy.

123
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:26,926
Give me your hand!

124
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:30,305
A whole car runs
into a bar...

125
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:33,641
and noone saw a thing?

126
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:38,563
As always.Noone sees
noone knows a thing.

127
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:45,904
-What's up, Shortie?
-They are hiding in the woods.

128
00:15:49,491 --> 00:15:53,953
I think they 
are hiding in the woods.

129
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:57,374
They are in the woods.

130
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:01,211
Fillipe, lock the car.
Rantzel, come with me.

131
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:18,603
Pitch black.
How do they see?

132
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:21,439
They stole a fortune
from the motel...

133
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:26,820
-What if we took the money?
-Are you out of your mind?

134
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:31,866
I do not want any trouble.
I just want to eliminate them.

135
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:37,414
Since when is it a crime
to steal from niggers and robbers?

136
00:16:37,956 --> 00:16:41,251
I know a snitch in the City.

137
00:17:09,738 --> 00:17:13,825
Did you hear the shootings?
If I find one of them,i will shoot him!

138
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:30,592
Maracana!
Open the door!

139
00:17:34,346 --> 00:17:36,306
They are after me!

140
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:53,156
The police is after me!
Hide me!

141
00:17:53,448 --> 00:17:54,616
Come inside.

142
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:06,544
Shit,the cops
still down there.

143
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:13,301
-I had a vision, Naive.
-Did you smoke anything?

144
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:19,474
you had a job,right?
How is it? What do they say to you?

145
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:25,480
I worked for my father.
Fathers say bullshit.

146
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:32,654
I'm leaving.I do not want to die.
I am not ment to be a gangster.

147
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:37,992
-The cops are down there.
-I don't care.

148
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:42,997
I am going back to the church.

149
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:49,087
"I am the resurrection
and the life..

150
00:18:49,587 --> 00:18:53,800
He that believeth in me,
though he were dead,yet shall he live..

151
00:18:54,175 --> 00:18:57,887
And whosoever liveth
 and believeth in me..

152
00:18:58,179 --> 00:19:02,142
shall never die..."

153
00:19:03,018 --> 00:19:04,936
Stop, or I'll shoot!

154
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:16,781
"He that believeth in me,
though he were dead,yet shall he live.."

155
00:19:17,866 --> 00:19:21,995
The robbery in the motel
was the most bloodstained in history.

156
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,790
The gangsters fortunes
changed paths.

157
00:19:25,874 --> 00:19:28,626
He must not have
 been a gangster.

158
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:32,464
He is a worker.

159
00:19:39,763 --> 00:19:43,558
snatcher was
in God's hands.

160
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:49,814
Hairy was caught
in the net of Bernice.

161
00:19:51,441 --> 00:19:54,652
and Naive was
in my father's hands.

162
00:19:55,278 --> 00:20:00,784
Why are you doing this?
You will be wotking with me!

163
00:20:01,743 --> 00:20:04,704
Your brother is
going to look after you.

164
00:20:06,081 --> 00:20:12,712
If i ever catch you with money
 that is not yours,I'll kill you!

165
00:20:13,004 --> 00:20:17,008
This goes for you too.
Put on the work wear!

166
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:24,516
If your brother is a gangster
you are affected as well!

167
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:28,353
Don't worry.
He will get over it.

168
00:20:37,028 --> 00:20:40,782
These things are not for you!
You go and study.

169
00:20:41,324 --> 00:20:42,951
Aren't you affraid of being killed?

170
00:20:43,118 --> 00:20:47,956
you are smart,
you have to go to college.

171
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:52,502
I attend school beacuse
i do not like working.

172
00:20:53,044 --> 00:20:57,090
Promise me that you are
never gonna touch this weapon.

173
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:08,601
Quickly.I will sell
lots of fish.Do not laugh!

174
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:12,522
You smiled when father
hit me.

175
00:21:41,343 --> 00:21:47,390
What's wrong?
Cat got your tongue?

176
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:50,060
I'm thinking how to tell you.

177
00:21:50,393 --> 00:21:54,356
You're gonna fry your brain
if you think so much.

178
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:59,194
My heart chose you.
I am listening to my heart.

179
00:21:59,486 --> 00:22:01,196
Are you kidding?

180
00:22:01,738 --> 00:22:05,325
Have you never head
of love at first sight?

181
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:10,622
-Gangsters do not love.
-You always talk to me in a bad way.

182
00:22:10,955 --> 00:22:17,504
-Gangsters seduce.
-i am not going to lose my peace.

183
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:22,092
Gangsters do not stop
just take a break.

184
00:22:22,801 --> 00:22:28,556
-You know nothing of love.
-This is no love it is a joke.

185
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,283
I love you.

186
00:22:48,743 --> 00:22:51,996
You might convince me
in the end.

187
00:23:14,269 --> 00:23:19,315
After the robbery,police
did raids in the ghetto.

188
00:23:25,739 --> 00:23:30,201
Everyday,someone was sent to jail,
someone was sold out.

189
00:23:32,829 --> 00:23:37,167
But noone ever knew anything.

190
00:23:38,501 --> 00:23:42,922
Noone revealed the
robbers hideout.

191
00:23:46,426 --> 00:23:48,261
THREE MONTHS LATER

192
00:23:48,595 --> 00:23:52,515
Why don't you change
life, Hairy?

193
00:23:53,308 --> 00:23:57,854
Find a job instead of
lying in bed all day!

194
00:23:58,396 --> 00:24:02,650
Do you think that a job will
give you money? Go try!

195
00:24:03,902 --> 00:24:07,530
What do you think 
I am doing all day long?

196
00:24:11,201 --> 00:24:15,246
Take it easy,baby.
All i want is you.

197
00:24:16,206 --> 00:24:21,836
to have children,a farm
with chicken,and lots of weed.

198
00:24:22,295 --> 00:24:24,881
I do not believe a word.

199
00:24:36,017 --> 00:24:39,062
i almost got rich
with that robbery.

200
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:45,694
Police is after you
after the motel killings.

201
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:56,079
What are you saying?Did you see anything?
so shut up!

202
00:24:56,663 --> 00:25:01,376
They shot them,
and blamed it to me!

203
00:25:01,751 --> 00:25:05,839
They even killed
Kid!So leave it!

204
00:25:06,923 --> 00:25:09,843
-I don't know who did it
-Not me.

205
00:25:10,051 --> 00:25:15,015
i do not a gangster as
the father of my children!

206
00:25:15,515 --> 00:25:17,308
You are alone,Hairy!

207
00:25:17,976 --> 00:25:21,688
Snatcher became religious,
Naive found a job.

208
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:24,065
-Anf you?
-I am the same!

209
00:25:24,524 --> 00:25:30,697
-Everybody dumped me.
-Then I will dump you too.

210
00:25:31,156 --> 00:25:36,578
I am leaving.If you want,come with
me,else i will leave alone!

211
00:25:51,968 --> 00:25:54,512
Nice fresh fish!!

212
00:25:54,888 --> 00:25:57,724
My brother promised
to conform.

213
00:25:58,058 --> 00:26:03,730
But the gangster does not change.
Just stops for a while.

214
00:26:04,147 --> 00:26:08,360
Naive was having an affair
with Shortie's wife.

215
00:26:10,028 --> 00:26:15,033
I have trout,but for you
I have something special.

216
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:17,660
It's a mullet.

217
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:25,460
Does your husband lick you?

218
00:26:28,672 --> 00:26:31,925
Mine, before fucking
he licks me for half an hour.

219
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:38,890
-From behind? Do you let him?
-No! Doesn't it hurt?

220
00:26:39,849 --> 00:26:45,647
In the begining,yes.After that it
is perfect!But you need a banana.

221
00:26:46,231 --> 00:26:50,944
-Why?
-You're losing the best part kid!

222
00:26:51,277 --> 00:26:55,657
You warm up a banana
and stick it in your pussy!

223
00:26:55,907 --> 00:26:59,619
while he fucks you in the ass.
It is awesome!

224
00:27:00,245 --> 00:27:06,960
-Ask your husband.
-I can't.he will get mad

225
00:27:07,377 --> 00:27:11,798
Try.Men go nuts
for stuff like that.

226
00:27:18,722 --> 00:27:20,807
Fucking nigger!

227
00:27:23,351 --> 00:27:25,270
Bitch!

228
00:27:26,896 --> 00:27:28,440

00:27:32,485 --> 00:27:37,782

shorts,quickly!

230
00:27:38,742 --> 00:27:43,830
-I am not gonna get naked in the street.
-Your brother is in danger!

231
00:27:45,373 --> 00:27:46,708
Give me the shirt!

232
00:27:49,794 --> 00:27:51,087
Quickly!

233
00:27:54,215 --> 00:27:57,135
I always pay the price.

234
00:28:06,686 --> 00:28:10,148
He run away.
It's his brother.

235
00:28:10,482 --> 00:28:12,067
I will cut his balls!

236
00:28:14,361 --> 00:28:18,990
Fish!Fresh fish!

237
00:28:20,325 --> 00:28:22,327
Kid,come here.

238
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:26,790
-Where is your brother?
-Not working today.

239
00:28:27,332 --> 00:28:30,877
-Get in.
-I did nothing.

240
00:28:31,586 --> 00:28:36,758
-What about my fish
-Get in.Forget fish.

241
00:28:39,511 --> 00:28:42,347
My father will
kill me .

242
00:28:54,818 --> 00:28:56,778
Let's go.There si nothing here.

243
00:28:57,278 --> 00:29:01,408
My father sweared not
to see my brother again.

244
00:29:06,287 --> 00:29:09,290
Noone saw him again
in the ghetto.

245
00:29:09,791 --> 00:29:12,919
Trio Mortes story
reached its end.

246
00:29:17,507 --> 00:29:21,136
Kid!i though you were killed
in the motel.

247
00:29:21,469 --> 00:29:25,640
-I can see you got money.
-It's ours,Benny.

248
00:29:27,767 --> 00:29:30,854
Cut the crap
and bring the money.

249
00:29:32,147 --> 00:29:38,194
Tell Hairy that
Shortie is getting hard.I'm leaving 

250
00:29:39,154 --> 00:29:41,573
But,Shortie was busy

251
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:10,643
A neighbour call the cops
before sunrise.

252
00:30:11,019 --> 00:30:13,646
The newpapers wrote:

253
00:30:14,064 --> 00:30:18,735
''A husband burries his wife
alive in the City of God''

254
00:30:18,818 --> 00:30:24,074
The place was full of cops.
The robbers run away.

255
00:30:27,452 --> 00:30:30,663
-Do you want to die?
-Do as I tell you.

256
00:30:31,289 --> 00:30:32,957
Some respect to the lady.

257
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:38,880
-Let's go.
-There are cops ahead.

258
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:42,842
Fuck them,go away.
Go wherever you want.

259
00:30:45,762 --> 00:30:47,138
What is up?

260
00:30:47,347 --> 00:30:50,308
Mercy.It ia a piece of crap.

261
00:30:50,517 --> 00:30:53,728
-Start the engine!
-Needs pushing.

262
00:30:55,814 --> 00:30:58,983
Push,Hairy.
Push!

263
00:31:12,872 --> 00:31:14,332
You?

264
00:31:17,877 --> 00:31:20,714
Do you want to arrest
the thieves?There..

265
00:31:21,089 --> 00:31:23,258
Get him!

266
00:31:48,283 --> 00:31:51,870
Run, Hairy!
Stop!

267
00:32:58,478 --> 00:32:59,938
He's a murderer!

268
00:33:00,355 --> 00:33:02,774
The day that Hairy
was killed. . .

269
00:33:02,982 --> 00:33:05,944
I remember the crowd
and a camera.

270
00:33:07,028 --> 00:33:10,073
I always wanted a camera.

271
00:33:26,548 --> 00:33:27,841
Let's go to scholl.

272
00:33:27,966 --> 00:33:31,261
-Why don't we go to the beach?
-We have exams!

273
00:33:31,594 --> 00:33:35,056
So what!
Everybody is in the beach!

274
00:33:37,267 --> 00:33:39,978
She wears bikini
and plays hard to get!

275
00:33:46,276 --> 00:33:49,696
Sun is for everyone.
Beach for a few.

276
00:33:50,697 --> 00:33:54,325
IN THE 70's

277
00:33:55,035 --> 00:33:58,371
When I was 16 i bought
my first camera.

278
00:33:58,705 --> 00:34:03,126
Starting from the low.
The cheapest model!

279
00:34:04,377 --> 00:34:08,798
How is it going,Rocket?
Have you been laid yet?

280
00:34:09,924 --> 00:34:11,134
Nothing.

281
00:34:13,595 --> 00:34:17,140
Angelica.She drove me mad..

282
00:34:17,974 --> 00:34:19,017
Rocket,are you jerking?

283
00:34:19,434 --> 00:34:25,690
Gorgeus and got laid.
I wanted to lose my virginity with her!

284
00:34:26,232 --> 00:34:30,487
-She has a boyfriend.
-So? i am not jealous

285
00:34:31,196 --> 00:34:34,240
-Her father is a cop.
-Noone is perfect.

286
00:34:36,743 --> 00:34:39,746
I was the official photographer
of the gang.

287
00:34:40,372 --> 00:34:42,040
of "Groovie Gang".

288
00:34:42,374 --> 00:34:45,502
Everybody paid for copies.

289
00:34:52,676 --> 00:34:57,806
Siago,move backwards.
There.

290
00:35:06,648 --> 00:35:08,274
i need a joint.

291
00:35:09,275 --> 00:35:13,697
Sniff coke.
It is great!

292
00:35:14,114 --> 00:35:18,576
Siago do u sniff?
I prefer a good pot.

293
00:35:20,954 --> 00:35:25,417
-I can find for you if you want.
-Go find then.

294
00:35:27,419 --> 00:35:31,715
If we talk about dope
we talk about coke!

295
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:33,800
Drugs!

296
00:35:36,845 --> 00:35:40,348
-you're full of salt.
-Fuck off.

297
00:35:42,308 --> 00:35:45,687
you want to be a lifeguard
but you never go inside.

298
00:35:45,979 --> 00:35:49,232
I bet a beer i
am a better swimmer.

299
00:35:53,403 --> 00:35:57,115
If you want i can find a joint
at Blackies.

300
00:36:10,337 --> 00:36:13,423
I would do anything for her.

301
00:36:14,632 --> 00:36:16,760
I would find pot,coke...

302
00:36:21,431 --> 00:36:26,144
I would go to the big ones
to buy good stuff..

303
00:36:28,229 --> 00:36:33,735
the boss was an ex
classmate: Blackie.

304
00:36:35,612 --> 00:36:37,781
-Who?
-Rocket!

305
00:36:42,619 --> 00:36:46,414
Who are things going?
The kids ok?

306
00:36:47,582 --> 00:36:50,043
Do you want to buy
or smoke?

307
00:36:55,715 --> 00:36:56,883
Who is it?

308
00:37:04,891 --> 00:37:10,105
This was Blackies hideout
But not since ever.

309
00:37:14,025 --> 00:37:18,196
Fuck off Kid
Why are u marching in like that?

310
00:37:18,822 --> 00:37:20,824
Is this your hideout?

311
00:37:22,158 --> 00:37:24,869
THE STORY OF THE HIDEOUT

312
00:37:25,203 --> 00:37:27,956
Donan Zel after becoming a widow
she started to sell drugs..

313
00:37:28,289 --> 00:37:30,875
to feed her children.

314
00:37:31,835 --> 00:37:36,840
She often gace out dope 
to the kids with exchange.

315
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:40,927
Her favourite was
 the Big Guy.

316
00:37:43,388 --> 00:37:48,518
She was such an amateur
that even Big Guy was cheating on her.

317
00:37:49,477 --> 00:37:54,441
Big Guy was using kids
as dealers.

318
00:37:54,899 --> 00:37:58,445
-My pot?
-Stick it in your ass.

319
00:37:59,029 --> 00:38:01,114
The best dealer..

320
00:38:03,366 --> 00:38:05,577
was Redhead.

321
00:38:07,579 --> 00:38:09,080
May i have a sip?

322
00:38:09,456 --> 00:38:12,167
Big Guy trusted him

323
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,544
and so he became a manager.

324
00:38:15,587 --> 00:38:19,174
twenty for us
five for you,Blackie.

325
00:38:20,467 --> 00:38:25,138
some day a friend of Redhead appeared.

326
00:38:25,388 --> 00:38:26,681
Aristotle.

327
00:38:28,725 --> 00:38:29,893
My wife is sick.

328
00:38:30,226 --> 00:38:34,064
His family had helped
Redhead.

329
00:38:34,397 --> 00:38:38,777
He would not refuse help
to a brother.

330
00:38:39,319 --> 00:38:43,615
The dope.i want the money
till Friday.

331
00:38:44,282 --> 00:38:46,534
You put me out of jail.

332
00:38:47,327 --> 00:38:49,621
He is a friend,Big Guy.

333
00:38:49,954 --> 00:38:53,375
Give him another week.

334
00:38:57,587 --> 00:39:00,298
You either kill him or I'll kill you.

335
00:39:00,632 --> 00:39:02,258
He had no choice.

336
00:39:02,634 --> 00:39:06,721
-I told you on Friday.
-Do not do it friend.

337
00:39:08,348 --> 00:39:11,184
Redhead wanted to get
the Big Guy..

338
00:39:11,434 --> 00:39:16,147
but he did not have to.
Big Guy died in jail.

339
00:39:19,776 --> 00:39:23,446
Redhead took the
belongings of Big Guy..

340
00:39:23,863 --> 00:39:28,451
but not the hideout.
It was cursed.

341
00:39:28,827 --> 00:39:32,706
He gave it to his trustee
Blakie.

342
00:39:33,707 --> 00:39:37,210
-hundred fifty bags.
-Not enough.

343
00:39:37,585 --> 00:39:40,088
So he took over
the local dealing.

344
00:39:40,338 --> 00:39:42,215
But not for long.

345
00:39:43,508 --> 00:39:45,260
Who is it?

346
00:39:46,094 --> 00:39:47,595
Go see.

347
00:39:59,274 --> 00:40:03,653
Fuck off kid.Why are
you rushing into my hideout?

348
00:40:04,195 --> 00:40:06,948
Who told you
it is yours?

349
00:40:13,413 --> 00:40:17,625
And i am not kid.
My name is Ze.

350
00:40:18,251 --> 00:40:21,212
THE STORY OF LITTLE ZE

351
00:40:21,546 --> 00:40:24,049
Ze wanted to rule
the City of God..

352
00:40:24,341 --> 00:40:27,135
since he was a kid.

353
00:40:32,807 --> 00:40:34,934
They are having fun and i am not?

354
00:40:45,111 --> 00:40:46,654
I want to go.

355
00:40:47,989 --> 00:40:51,451
What do you want? 
Your friend took it all.

356
00:40:58,208 --> 00:41:01,961
That night,Kid
satisfied his thirst for blood.

357
00:41:02,295 --> 00:41:04,923
knowing that Hairy
would never forgive him.

358
00:41:11,596 --> 00:41:15,767
To save himself
he left the City of God.

359
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:19,354
He worked all day for nickels.

360
00:41:25,652 --> 00:41:28,196
Kid and Benny
really made it..

361
00:41:30,156 --> 00:41:32,534
they had the gift of the killer.

362
00:41:33,201 --> 00:41:35,286
-You have more.
-i had the idea.

363
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:38,623
the problem was to handle
an older gangster.

364
00:41:38,915 --> 00:41:40,375
like my brother Goose.

365
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:47,674
Damnit!i though you died in the motel
You have lots of money!

366
00:41:48,758 --> 00:41:51,136
It is our money,Benny.

367
00:41:52,637 --> 00:41:57,976
Benny,tell Hairy that
Shortie is getting hard.

368
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:01,187
I'm leaving the ghetto.

369
00:42:06,067 --> 00:42:11,239
From Hairy.
You are gonna need it.

370
00:42:31,718 --> 00:42:34,429
robbery after robbery
the Kid grew big.

371
00:42:34,763 --> 00:42:39,017
In his 18s he was the
 most respected gangster in the City

372
00:42:41,186 --> 00:42:44,230
One of the most
 dangerous robbers in Rio.

373
00:42:58,286 --> 00:43:03,541
Happy birthday Kid.
Glad you turned 18.

374
00:43:03,833 --> 00:43:04,834
Beat it!

375
00:43:08,505 --> 00:43:11,883
-Just a beer!
-Didn't you see me asshole?

376
00:43:12,175 --> 00:43:16,930
Next time, I will kill
you prick!

377
00:43:22,686 --> 00:43:25,772
Kid was ready for everything!

378
00:43:27,899 --> 00:43:29,818
And couldn't wait.

379
00:43:29,901 --> 00:43:31,778
Whos is the wealthiest here?

380
00:43:32,153 --> 00:43:34,572
Lots.
Jerry Andriani..

381
00:43:36,032 --> 00:43:39,327
golden necklace,luxurious clothes.

382
00:43:39,994 --> 00:43:45,041
-Perriera and the chick.
-My brother took her.

383
00:43:45,333 --> 00:43:46,584
Look at the race.

384
00:43:47,377 --> 00:43:51,965
Here is Blackie.
Full of gold.

385
00:43:54,217 --> 00:43:59,472
Redhead.Nice wheels!
All of the dealers.

386
00:43:59,723 --> 00:44:04,310
-All of them wealthy.
-Robberies and shit.

387
00:44:04,561 --> 00:44:07,272
the big money
is in drug dealing .

388
00:44:07,564 --> 00:44:11,234
-Especialy coke.
-Needs capital though.

389
00:44:11,484 --> 00:44:14,654
We will kill them
and take over.

390
00:44:15,488 --> 00:44:18,241
-When do we start
-Now.

391
00:44:27,584 --> 00:44:31,588
The light of Satan
brought you here!

392
00:44:32,047 --> 00:44:39,054
Why do you live in the City of God
that God has forgotten?

393
00:44:40,805 --> 00:44:44,768
i know what you want.
you want power.

394
00:44:45,226 --> 00:44:49,731
i have something that wiil give
you the power you're looking for.

395
00:44:50,857 --> 00:44:55,487
that will change tour fate.
I give you my amullet.

396
00:44:56,404 --> 00:45:01,743
Just do not fuck
while you wear it..

397
00:45:03,078 --> 00:45:05,163
because you will die!

398
00:45:06,331 --> 00:45:11,628
The kid will no longer be Kid
but Ze.

399
00:45:11,836 --> 00:45:14,339
Little Ze grew up.

400
00:45:14,756 --> 00:45:18,301
If you help me
I will help you.

401
00:45:29,688 --> 00:45:33,024
this way Kid became Ze
and started the killings.

402
00:45:34,317 --> 00:45:37,487
One morning
he took over Andriani's gang..

403
00:45:42,075 --> 00:45:46,705
till the night,he ruled
all the ghetto gangs.

404
00:45:47,122 --> 00:45:51,668
He did not harm Redhead
since he was Bennie's friens.

405
00:45:52,085 --> 00:45:55,964
Only the hideout was left.
but it was an easy job.

406
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:01,428
Who is it?

407
00:46:10,437 --> 00:46:14,232
Fuck off kid.Why are you
rushing into my hideout?

408
00:46:14,607 --> 00:46:16,484
Since when is it your hideout?

409
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:18,653
Anything wrong Kid?

410
00:46:20,030 --> 00:46:23,575
i am not Kid.
My name is Ze!

411
00:46:23,992 --> 00:46:26,953
-You're dead bastard.
-No,he understands.

412
00:46:29,873 --> 00:46:34,461
All yours I want nothing
I do not want trouble.

413
00:46:34,794 --> 00:46:38,048
I had to take vegeance
on my brother's death.

414
00:46:40,592 --> 00:46:44,220
you are gonna live
but you will work for us.

415
00:46:44,596 --> 00:46:45,847
Easy to say.

416
00:46:47,349 --> 00:46:50,060
-Where are you going?
-He's clean Ze.

417
00:46:51,603 --> 00:46:54,022
-Waht is your name?
-Rocket

418
00:46:54,647 --> 00:46:59,235
Naive's brother.
Dead Naive's brother.

419
00:47:01,404 --> 00:47:07,786
Go and tell everyone
that Ze is now in charge.

420
00:47:08,453 --> 00:47:11,373
We are selling coke.
Got it?

421
00:47:20,173 --> 00:47:23,134
Drug dealing is a job too!

422
00:47:23,677 --> 00:47:27,764
the supplier brings the merchantise
which is packed.

423
00:47:29,015 --> 00:47:32,102
All is a chain.

424
00:47:34,896 --> 00:47:38,608
Pot is wrapped.

425
00:47:39,651 --> 00:47:45,990
coke is packed in 10s or 100s.

426
00:47:47,659 --> 00:47:50,912
You can be a 
carrierist drug dealer.

427
00:47:51,287 --> 00:47:54,833
The kids start as messengers.

428
00:47:55,208 --> 00:47:58,878
Then they do lookouts.

429
00:47:59,629 --> 00:48:04,634
If the cops come
they all vanish.

430
00:48:06,845 --> 00:48:10,390
Then you become a dealer.

431
00:48:10,890 --> 00:48:15,437
In hard times
the dealer vanishes.

432
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:17,689
Growing up,
you become captain.

433
00:48:18,273 --> 00:48:22,068
And if you are good in
math,you become a manager.

434
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:24,654
Bosses right hand.

435
00:48:27,699 --> 00:48:30,952
The cops get their cut
and stay out of it.

436
00:48:33,413 --> 00:48:38,710
Whan ze came,
all the rivals stopped in the City.

437
00:48:39,252 --> 00:48:41,046
You could go there.

438
00:48:41,421 --> 00:48:45,508
Bohemian people bought
their dope safely.

439
00:48:46,301 --> 00:48:50,597
Lots of people became addicts
and Ze became rich.

440
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:02,108
-Which one should I wear?
-This is cool.

441
00:49:02,776 --> 00:49:06,654
If drug dealing was legal
Ze would be given an Oscar.

442
00:49:10,367 --> 00:49:13,828
I thought that all these
are very dangerous.

443
00:49:14,454 --> 00:49:17,374
However he was everywhere.

444
00:49:17,916 --> 00:49:22,379
If i needed pot
I had to visit Redhead .

445
00:49:27,801 --> 00:49:30,637
-Half a pound.
-Thanks.

446
00:49:31,763 --> 00:49:35,684
It was woth it.
I smoked it with Angelica.

447
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:42,941
She had broken up with Siago
and so I made my move.

448
00:49:43,608 --> 00:49:46,361
Fantastic photos.

449
00:49:48,196 --> 00:49:49,906
Do i look good here?

450
00:49:50,865 --> 00:49:52,742
You look good in all of them.

451
00:49:57,372 --> 00:50:02,252
Twilight,an empty beach,
a long-lasting kiss..

452
00:50:02,794 --> 00:50:04,754
That was it...

453
00:50:06,423 --> 00:50:08,633
But the Shorties came...

454
00:50:09,634 --> 00:50:12,178
Will you give me a splif?

455
00:50:18,226 --> 00:50:19,477
Here.

456
00:50:21,271 --> 00:50:23,231
See you later.

457
00:50:28,653 --> 00:50:31,614
-Your joint!
-Keep it!

458
00:50:37,203 --> 00:50:40,999
First time i met
the Shorties.

459
00:50:47,422 --> 00:50:49,632
Steak and potatoes.

460
00:50:54,304 --> 00:50:57,891
-This is for you.
-All of it?Thanks.

461
00:50:58,433 --> 00:51:00,810
Do you want to have something to eat?

462
00:51:05,815 --> 00:51:07,442
Can you change the time in the clock please?

463
00:51:07,525 --> 00:51:12,030
After he broke up,Siago
sniffed more and more everyday.

464
00:51:15,367 --> 00:51:20,163
When you become an addict, 
you're in the dealer's hands.

465
00:51:20,705 --> 00:51:23,249
-Two bags of ten.
-One bag.

466
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:26,461
For Siago it waa not like that.

467
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:32,175
-Sorry, godfather.
-Bullshit, did I baptize you?

468
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:42,477
Give me your bike,
Blackie.

469
00:52:06,626 --> 00:52:08,294
Do you wanna race?

470
00:52:10,255 --> 00:52:12,215
Till the bus.

471
00:52:13,550 --> 00:52:15,677
Ready?Go!

472
00:52:38,616 --> 00:52:41,828
-Hard race.
-You're good.

473
00:52:43,455 --> 00:52:46,583
-Where did you buy the triners from?
-From the neighborhood.

474
00:52:46,916 --> 00:52:49,669
-And the shirt?
-From the City.

475
00:52:50,295 --> 00:52:51,504
It is an expensive brand.

476
00:52:52,839 --> 00:52:55,300
If i give you the money
will you buy me one?

477
00:52:55,592 --> 00:52:57,344
Shorts and shirt?

478
00:53:00,555 --> 00:53:02,307
Buy whatever you can.

479
00:53:05,310 --> 00:53:07,645
-What is your size?
-Measure me!

480
00:53:08,104 --> 00:53:09,689
-With what?
-With you!

481
00:53:12,150 --> 00:53:14,569
Shoe number?
Turn around.

482
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:26,539
Benny!Did you get the goodies?

483
00:53:30,669 --> 00:53:34,047
-Just a pair of trousers?
-There is more.

484
00:53:40,136 --> 00:53:41,388
Do you like it?

485
00:53:42,722 --> 00:53:46,267
-You have some change.
-Keep it.

486
00:54:00,573 --> 00:54:02,242
This is Benny.

487
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:29,769
I became bohemian.

488
00:54:33,231 --> 00:54:36,943
Gangsters,listen.
Beware...

489
00:54:37,652 --> 00:54:42,574
Groovies are making moves
before the big boom .

490
00:54:54,377 --> 00:54:56,254
Fuck you,bastards!

491
00:54:59,799 --> 00:55:01,176
Prick!

492
00:55:16,691 --> 00:55:20,320
Redhead is placing
the ghetto in danger.

493
00:55:20,737 --> 00:55:26,451
Go talk to him.You can't
just shoot everybody.

494
00:55:30,205 --> 00:55:32,916
Don't worry,
the lads here are ok .

495
00:55:33,208 --> 00:55:34,918
I don't worry!

496
00:55:36,294 --> 00:55:40,840
Will you dance, Benny? What
happened with the Redhead?

497
00:55:42,592 --> 00:55:44,052
Go talk to him!

498
00:55:44,511 --> 00:55:48,181
Benny was the coolest
gangster in the City.

499
00:55:48,515 --> 00:55:51,226
He gave away dope,
paid for his drinks.

500
00:55:51,935 --> 00:55:55,647
Ze was the opposite.
He was obsessed.

501
00:55:55,980 --> 00:55:58,775
Wanted to become the big ghetto boss.

502
00:55:59,150 --> 00:56:01,861
He was looking for the opportunity
to take over Redhead's gang.

503
00:56:02,404 --> 00:56:06,866
Don't let the Shorties
rob the whole ghetto.

504
00:56:07,701 --> 00:56:11,246
You mind your business
and I will mind mine.

505
00:56:12,747 --> 00:56:14,332
I'm going for a drink.

506
00:56:22,507 --> 00:56:24,551
How is it going Rocket?

507
00:56:31,141 --> 00:56:32,851
Siago, what's up?

508
00:56:35,687 --> 00:56:37,439
Want to dance?

509
00:56:43,153 --> 00:56:44,654
Can we go to your palce?

510
00:56:45,030 --> 00:56:49,826
My parents are not home.
You're gonna be alone.

511
00:56:50,118 --> 00:56:52,954
Today you can
lose your virginity!

512
00:56:53,288 --> 00:56:56,708
Don't shout!
Everyone will hear!

513
00:56:57,959 --> 00:56:59,627
You're pretty.

514
00:57:02,589 --> 00:57:04,674
It's ok.

515
00:57:12,098 --> 00:57:15,685
I know you are related to
the Shorties.

516
00:57:16,603 --> 00:57:21,232
Do you think I am stupid?
You want my gang?

517
00:57:21,566 --> 00:57:24,778
I just want to talk to you.
You are useless!

518
00:57:25,195 --> 00:57:27,947
The Shorties
are endagering us.

519
00:57:28,281 --> 00:57:29,657
Ask them to cool down.

520
00:57:29,991 --> 00:57:35,789
He lets them plunder
in his ghetto,the useless.

521
00:57:36,664 --> 00:57:40,418
If police come here
we're fucked.

522
00:57:41,294 --> 00:57:44,130
I will do it because i like you.

523
00:57:44,506 --> 00:57:47,634
Change his dipers!

524
00:57:50,345 --> 00:57:55,517
Tell him that noone
plunders in my ghetto!

525
00:58:00,438 --> 00:58:05,068
Shorties do not respect
the ghetto rules.

526
00:58:05,527 --> 00:58:10,532
They steal from ordinary people
and rob bakeries.

527
00:58:19,457 --> 00:58:21,626
You're stealing from me all the time!

528
00:58:21,876 --> 00:58:26,881
However,they didn't know
the city had a new boss!

529
00:58:28,675 --> 00:58:30,593
THANK YOU
FOR PREFERING US

530
00:58:30,969 --> 00:58:34,806
The city has become safer
fot the inhabitants.

531
00:58:36,057 --> 00:58:38,309
Robberies are rare.

532
00:58:39,227 --> 00:58:41,312
All you have to do is visit Ze.

533
00:58:42,689 --> 00:58:46,192
-Do not touch Shorties
-I don't.

534
00:58:52,991 --> 00:58:55,326
-Let's go for a walk
-Together?

535
00:58:57,996 --> 00:59:00,081
Mom, I am going out
with my friends.

536
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:16,514
I have never tasted a better chicken!

537
00:59:16,931 --> 00:59:20,769
-The old man was scared to death!
-you feel sorry for him?

538
00:59:32,155 --> 00:59:35,075
Should we rob a bank
or a supermarket?

539
00:59:35,492 --> 00:59:38,578
Bullshit.All the money
is in drug dealing.

540
00:59:41,456 --> 00:59:45,794
You have to start as
a messenger.

541
00:59:46,419 --> 00:59:50,006
It is no good.Takes too
much time to be promoted.

542
00:59:52,092 --> 00:59:56,429
You have to wait for
an old guy to get killed.

543
00:59:56,721 --> 01:00:01,267
I won't wait for anyone to
 bite the dust.I'll do as Ze.

544
01:00:02,977 --> 01:00:05,772

Anyone else?

548
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:37,637

the ones who run away.
