172
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,743
You sound like a 5-year-old, Virg.

I want you two
to head up to Horseshoe.

174

That Morg, he sure
has a temper on him, don't he?

180
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:50,915
He's a dangerous one, just as soon
shoot a mustang as catch it.

181
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:54,281
Oh, he wouldn't do that.
That'd cost him too much money.

182

You ain't knowed him
as long as I have.

that automatic.45 Colt of his,

186
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:08,063

187

to follow his Judas horse.

He spent hours at it,
getting madder and madder.

192
00:11:19,945 --> 00:11:23,312
Finally he lost it, went crazy.

193

Shot six horses, just like that.

202

about a photography project
she wants to do.

203
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:38,114
Sent it about six weeks ago,
more or less.

204

Oh, the tree hugger.

I'm trying to get shots of the
wild horses in their natural habitat.

209
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:50,160
Like I said, tree huggers.

210
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:52,770
Here. Sign this.

211
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:55,037
Uh, what is it?

212
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:57,665
It's a form
absolving the county of liability.

213
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:01,246
- It's a standard form.
- Right.

214
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:02,778
- How old are you?
- Eleven.

215
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:05,679
I got socks older than you.

216
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:08,519
- It's a fairy tale, you know.
- What?

217
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:11,646
- SHERIFF: The Black Stallion.
- Black Stallion?

218
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:13,655
Well, that's
what you're here to see, isn't it?

Well, I don't know. Is it?

220
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:16,454
You mean, the famous Black Stallion?

221
00:13:16,695 --> 00:13:19,528
That's what folks think,
but it isn't true.

222
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:22,189
There is no mysterious
Black Stallion here.

There's no Black Beauty here.

of beat-up old cayuses

and that's gospel.

226

You know a lot
about mustangs, do you?

227
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:32,973
Well, I've read a lot about them.

Where are you looking
to take pictures of these mustangs?

235

- Bear Mountain Ranch.
- Hah! Mustang Matty herself.

237

Well... I do know that.

- Bye.

wouldn't you say?

- Hear what?

About the babysitting.

247
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:26,762
Oh, you'll do fine.

248
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:31,127
But I wanted to get closer
with the mustangs this summer,

249
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:34,034
see if... <i>he's</i> there.

250
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:36,365
Well, now you have
someone to do it with.

251
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:37,507
Yeah, somebody your own age.

252
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:41,043
You think he's out there, Dallas?

253
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,647
Dallas doesn't think.

254
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:45,511
Oh, this is coming from a guy
who wanted to drop out of high school

255
00:14:45,651 --> 00:14:48,245
because Larry had an opening
at The Lube Rack.

256
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:50,753
That was a good job.
Hey, a lot of people wanted that job.

259
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:56,989
they put bottlecaps
on their front doors to look nice.

at mustangs up at Starvation,

you'll miss the rodeo club.

267
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:19,649

it will be you, CJ.

- Take your brother.
- Kyle? Why?

270
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:30,419

brothers are handy to have around.

That's what I'm paying you for, isn't it?

339
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:39,239
- Yes, sir.
- End of the week.

340
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:40,708
Don't disappoint me.

341
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:43,278
I won't.

342
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:52,752
[Birds chirp]

343
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:54,583
[Water splashes]

344
00:19:54,726 --> 00:19:56,284
Ain't gonna do you any good.

345
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:58,986
How would you know, BB-brain?

346
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:02,098
Now, is that the same pot
that you washed the strawberries in?

347
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:03,757
Maybe.

348
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:05,464
You don't know?

349
00:20:05,637 --> 00:20:06,604
You writing a book?

350
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:08,262
Well, at least I can write.

351
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:14,206
Look, Matty wants you
to set another plate for supper.

352
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:15,371
Who?

353
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:18,449
Some new girl coming in
to take photographs of wild horses.

354
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:21,883
Name's, uh... Hannah.

355
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,248
As if I ain't got enough to do.

356
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:26,516
Oh, phew,
what do you do besides cook?

357
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:28,057
It ain't that good anyways.

358
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,387
Well, you're the one that thinks
pork and beans is gourmet food.

359
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,553
I thought you washed on Mondays.

360
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:35,995
I do, but I don't have
enough time to wash and cook.

361
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,726
- You should work longer.
- I work 24 hours a day now.

362
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:42,435
- You should work nights.
- [Scoffs]

363
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:45,806
Those are women's underwear,
by the way.

364
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:50,642
Yeah, well, then they fit...
should fit you just fine...

365
00:20:50,782 --> 00:20:52,044
Buggy.

366
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:01,522
[Engine stops,
parking brake engages]

367
00:21:22,748 --> 00:21:25,046
HANNAH: You own all this?

368
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:27,550
All Stedman land,

369
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:30,588
from Horseshoe up north
down to Starvation in the south.

370
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,257
Best view is here.

371
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:34,347
Thought you'd like to see it.

372
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:40,721
- Charlie and I bought a little at a time.
- Your husband?

373
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:48,038
Started out with 200 acres,
added parcels as we could afford it.

374
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:51,132
The price of cattle was better then.

375
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,971
I don't see any cattle.

376
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:54,578
That's because there aren't any.

377
00:21:56,281 --> 00:21:58,806
Not anymore.

378
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:02,044
Had to sell off the herd
to keep the bank from foreclosing

379
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,416
after Charlie...

380
00:22:08,193 --> 00:22:09,592
You always wear that getup?

381
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:12,058
Getup?

382
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,098
Your clothes.

383
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:16,631
- What's wrong with my clothes?
- Well, you look like a Fruit Loop.

384
00:22:17,402 --> 00:22:19,165
I think I look okay.

385
00:22:19,638 --> 00:22:21,663
What do you want to do here, exactly?

386
00:22:22,207 --> 00:22:24,903
Photograph the wild horses
in their natural habitat.

387
00:22:26,411 --> 00:22:29,744
- You any good?
- I think so.

388
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:33,248
- Let's have a look.
- Okay.

389
00:22:46,164 --> 00:22:48,064
You have a good eye.

390
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:51,932
- Thanks.
- But your pictures are lonely.

391
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:54,129
HANNAH: Lonely?

392
00:22:54,239 --> 00:22:56,537
Solitary.

393
00:22:56,675 --> 00:22:57,937
Empty.

394
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:01,311
I just take pictures
of stuff that interests me.

395
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:04,641
But none of your subjects are alive.

396
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,149
HANNAH:
I have shots of people at home.

397
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:07,983
Yeah? But these are the ones
that you show folks.

398
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:09,142
I think they're the best.

399
00:23:09,354 --> 00:23:10,651
MATTY:
Have you ever seen a mustang?

400
00:23:10,822 --> 00:23:11,652
No.

401
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:15,625
- They're hard to get close to.
- I have zoom lenses with me.

402
00:23:15,827 --> 00:23:17,920
That's not what I meant.

403
00:23:18,096 --> 00:23:21,862
You have to get to know animals
before you take pictures of them.

404
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:23,298
That takes some doing.

405
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:26,063
- I'm ready for that.
- MATTY: Is that why you came?

406
00:23:26,505 --> 00:23:28,234
Is that all you're here for?

407
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:31,941
I want to take the pictures
so I can publish them.

408
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:36,206
Maybe it will make people more
aware of the horses' plight out here.

409
00:23:36,381 --> 00:23:39,578
So, you think you know the problems
of the mustang, do you?

410
00:23:39,718 --> 00:23:42,209
Well, I know they're dying out,
and I want to help save them.

411
00:23:42,387 --> 00:23:44,514
You're gonna save them
by taking pictures of them?

412
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:45,678
It's a start.

413
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:47,449
I want to photograph
the wild horses

414
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:50,186
and maybe let people
know their story before it's lost.

415
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:55,690
You got sand, girl.

416
00:23:55,867 --> 00:23:57,391
I'll give you that.

417
00:23:57,502 --> 00:23:59,436
What's that mean?

418
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:02,267
It means I'll help you if you help me.

419
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,432
Help you what?

420
00:24:04,576 --> 00:24:06,203
Save them.

421
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:09,846
I've spent pretty much my whole life
trying to give the horses

422
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:12,176
a chance at living.

423
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:15,617
I can't do it alone.
I tried, but...

424
00:24:15,754 --> 00:24:16,516
[Sighs]

425
00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:19,723
I just want
to make a difference here.

426
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,188
Maybe I could help.

427
00:24:24,095 --> 00:24:26,655
We'll see.

428
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:29,456
[Horse neighs]

429
00:24:31,002 --> 00:24:33,232
I was wondering where you were.

430
00:24:33,338 --> 00:24:35,533
Kyle and I were up at Starvation.

431
00:24:35,707 --> 00:24:37,265
Saw some new mares
and colts today.

432
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:39,773
- How many?
- Dozen, maybe.

433
00:24:42,247 --> 00:24:45,739
CJ, this is Hannah.
She's here to take pictures.

434
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:47,876
- Hi.
- Hi.

435
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:52,313
- You're after him, aren't you?
- Him?

436
00:24:52,858 --> 00:24:56,419
- She means the Black Stallion.
- Is there a Black Stallion?

437
00:24:56,795 --> 00:24:57,955
Not so far.

438
00:24:58,630 --> 00:24:59,562
We don't know.

439
00:25:00,131 --> 00:25:01,029
Maybe I will.

440
00:25:01,433 --> 00:25:04,197
[Laughter]

441
00:25:04,302 --> 00:25:06,770
You got about as much chance
of seeing that black renegade

442
00:25:06,938 --> 00:25:09,771
as we do of being
next year's rodeo queen.

443
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:11,742
Hope I've got
more of a chance than that.

444
00:25:13,778 --> 00:25:16,008
[Laughter]

445
00:25:17,315 --> 00:25:19,078
[Horses neigh]

446
00:25:54,085 --> 00:25:57,282
We'll need twice that many a week.

447
00:25:57,389 --> 00:26:00,449
Yes, sir. I know that.
I've got to keep a low profile.

448
00:26:00,592 --> 00:26:02,150
The sheriff's been snooping around.

449
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,225
I don't care if you
have to crawl on your belly.

450
00:26:04,362 --> 00:26:06,523
If you can't get me
the mustangs I need,

451
00:26:06,698 --> 00:26:08,325
then I'll get them from somebody else.

452
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,331
You will have
all the wild mustangs you can use

453
00:26:10,502 --> 00:26:13,027
for your drug testing, Mr. Novak,
you have my word.

454
00:26:13,204 --> 00:26:14,637
You've got a big mouth, Deputy.

455
00:26:15,874 --> 00:26:18,138
I didn't say what I
needed them for, did I? Huh?

456
00:26:19,377 --> 00:26:20,969
No.

457
00:26:21,112 --> 00:26:22,079
No, you didn't.

458
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:24,978
I'll give you a 50º% bonus
for every mustang you can bring me

459
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:26,515
by the end of this month.

460
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:28,745
What's this I hear
about a Black Stallion?

461
00:26:28,887 --> 00:26:32,516
Oh, it's nothing.
Local legend, that's all.

462
00:26:32,657 --> 00:26:34,022
Any truth to it?

463
00:26:35,293 --> 00:26:36,089
Couldn't say.

464
00:26:36,227 --> 00:26:39,321
I'd be interested in that stallion.

465
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,126
Very interested.

466
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:44,427
Extremely interested.

467
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:47,370
Understand?

468
00:26:47,472 --> 00:26:51,909
Yeah. Yeah, I do,
but... what for, research?

469
00:26:52,143 --> 00:26:54,873
Not research. Resource.

470
00:26:55,413 --> 00:26:58,143
Sizzle, not steak.

471
00:26:58,383 --> 00:27:00,283
Novak Industries needs an icon,

472
00:27:00,418 --> 00:27:03,353
and the mythical Black Stallion
would be a good one...

473
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:04,547
...don't you think?

474
00:27:06,491 --> 00:27:08,550
- Huh?
- Yes, sir.

475
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:35,976
Hannah, there are some things
you need to know.

476
00:27:36,588 --> 00:27:37,748
What things?

477
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:42,659
Out here, we take care of our own...

478
00:27:43,962 --> 00:27:46,692
...people and animals.

479
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:48,930
I know that.

480
00:27:49,034 --> 00:27:51,935
She means we stand together.

481
00:27:52,871 --> 00:27:55,999
And horses are just like people.

482
00:27:56,174 --> 00:28:02,170
They make families, care for
each other, protect each other,

483
00:28:02,313 --> 00:28:07,683
and if something or someone
comes in and threatens them,

484
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:11,448
they face it straight on...

485
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:13,614
...together.

486
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:15,659
Okay.

487
00:28:19,164 --> 00:28:26,400
We have been protecting them,
CJ's folks and me.

488
00:28:26,504 --> 00:28:31,100
I've always felt the mustangs
deserve the same chance I had...

489
00:28:31,242 --> 00:28:33,267
...we've had.

490
00:28:33,445 --> 00:28:38,542
You know, raise a family,
care for them,

491
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:41,743
without being corralled doing it.

492
00:28:41,986 --> 00:28:45,752
- Try to protect them.
- What's wrong with that?

493
00:28:47,258 --> 00:28:50,489
Nothing.

494
00:28:50,662 --> 00:28:55,497
Of course, the government feels
a bit differently about it than we do.

495
00:28:56,267 --> 00:29:01,068
- How?
- They have roundups every so often.

496
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:03,207
They take the mares and colts.

497
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:07,333
Matty protects them.

498
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:09,737
Truth be known,

499
00:29:09,881 --> 00:29:12,145
that's against the law.

500
00:29:13,785 --> 00:29:17,152
Now, I don't hold much for secrets,

501
00:29:17,288 --> 00:29:21,281
never knew one to be kept.

502
00:29:21,826 --> 00:29:27,264
What we're telling you here
right now, this is not a secret,

503
00:29:27,365 --> 00:29:31,426
but we don't talk about it much.

504
00:29:31,569 --> 00:29:32,729
You understand?

505
00:29:33,872 --> 00:29:38,832
- I think so.
- MATTY: You figure I'm wrong?

506
00:29:41,913 --> 00:29:43,380
It doesn't matter.

507
00:29:43,548 --> 00:29:46,210
All that matters
is what happens to the mustangs.

508
00:29:46,317 --> 00:29:48,478
I'm just here to take some pictures.

509
00:29:55,827 --> 00:29:58,261
Fair enough.

510
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:04,300
Your daddy did a good job with you.

511
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,799
Show her to her bunk, CJ.

512
00:30:08,907 --> 00:30:10,704
Come on back.

00:30:28,059 --> 00:30:30,823
[Laughter]

517
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:39,568
- Can you ride?
- Sort of.

518
00:30:39,771 --> 00:30:41,102
Sort of?

519
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:44,570
I've been horseback riding before.

520
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:47,611
All people who can't ride a horse
call it "horseback riding."

521
00:30:47,712 --> 00:30:50,340
I can ride, and I'm not a city
slicker. I'm just from the city.

522
00:30:50,615 --> 00:30:52,549
- I didn't...
- You didn't have to.

523
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,287
Sorry.

524
00:30:56,988 --> 00:30:59,252
It's okay.

525
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:00,379
You want to ride?

526
00:31:00,992 --> 00:31:02,584
You're on!

527
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:25,410
Are they midgets?

528
00:31:25,583 --> 00:31:28,814
Not midgets.
More like teeny babies.

529
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:31,580
Why do girls always
have to call them "babies"?

530
00:31:31,689 --> 00:31:33,680
What would you call them
if you just saw them for the first time?

531
00:31:33,858 --> 00:31:34,790
KYLE: Stupid.

532
00:31:34,926 --> 00:31:38,885
No. That's what they'd call you,
not the horses.

533
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:42,893
So, are they babies?

534
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:45,195
No.

[Horses neigh]

536
00:31:47,105 --> 00:31:52,407
That one is Ivy. That is Bow.
The smallest one is Arrow.

537
00:31:53,945 --> 00:31:55,003
Where did you find them?

538
00:31:55,213 --> 00:31:57,909
My dad found them about a year ago
up in the mountains.

539
00:31:58,016 --> 00:31:59,813
They were wild, too.

540
00:32:00,618 --> 00:32:02,176
Wild midget horses?

541
00:32:02,353 --> 00:32:03,251
[Laughter]

542
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:07,118
Yeah, kind of, I guess.

543
00:32:07,992 --> 00:32:10,893
They're like those horses from the old
"My Pretty Pony" cartoons, remember?

544
00:32:11,062 --> 00:32:13,656
- Those cartoons sucked.
- I liked them.

545
00:32:13,865 --> 00:32:15,196
Well, you would.

546
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:18,332
They're smart, too.

547
00:32:20,204 --> 00:32:22,468
Come on.
I want to show you something.

548
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:25,174
- What?
- What you came for.

549
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:27,705
- Do you have your camera?
- Yeah. Always have it.

550
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:29,710
- Good.
- KYLE: Where?

551
00:32:29,881 --> 00:32:31,872
- Starvation.
- KYLE: Right.

552
00:32:41,492 --> 00:32:43,858
Cheyenne tribes call it
Washitaqua.

553
00:32:44,028 --> 00:32:45,723
It means "horse heavens."

554
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:50,733
But the mustangs
run here, Starvation.

555
00:32:50,902 --> 00:32:53,700
You know a lot
about Indians and stuff, huh?

556
00:32:53,905 --> 00:32:56,499
I know a little.

557
00:32:56,741 --> 00:32:58,038
Why do they call it Starvation?

558
00:32:58,276 --> 00:33:02,303
A hundred years ago, rustlers used
to bring the livestock they stole here.

559
00:33:02,513 --> 00:33:05,676
One winter, they left them penned up
and the animals starved.

560
00:33:06,184 --> 00:33:11,486
- That's awful.
- Yeah. The name stuck.

561
00:33:15,093 --> 00:33:16,082
Look!

[Horses neigh]

563
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:26,897
Whoa. Yeah. They're beautiful.

564
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:32,066
I got to get some shots.
This is what I came for.

565
00:33:33,745 --> 00:33:36,270
You know a lot about cameras, huh?

566
00:33:36,381 --> 00:33:38,679
I know a little.

567
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:40,508
What kind of camera is that?

568
00:33:40,718 --> 00:33:44,814
It's my dad's, but I use it.
It's pretty easy, really.

569
00:33:44,989 --> 00:33:46,422
KYLE:
You don't use digital, huh?

570
00:33:46,557 --> 00:33:48,252
No. I learned to shoot film.

571
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:52,018
I wish... I mean,
I got a little disposable, is all.

572
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:54,230
Well, I have a small Canon
you can use.

573
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:55,593
- Are you serious?
- Sure.

574
00:33:55,833 --> 00:33:56,993
Shoot a roll,
and see how you like it.

575
00:33:57,168 --> 00:33:58,999
You're trusting my brother
with your camera?

00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:00,797
- Why not?
- Yeah. Why not?

577

- Says you.
- Says everybody.

- He'll be careful. Right?
- Oh, yeah.

580
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:14,650
Look!

00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:16,948
KYLE:
Haven't seen them before.

582
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:21,817
I thought you said you saw
the wild horses all the time.

583
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:26,692
Not these. They're new.

584
00:34:26,831 --> 00:34:28,992
- You won't see a stallion.
- What's that mean?

585
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:31,499
KYLE:
Wild horses are family units.

586
00:34:31,669 --> 00:34:34,661
Each family has a stallion
and a brood of mares and colts.

587
00:34:36,641 --> 00:34:38,666
KYLE:
This one doesn't have a stallion.

588
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:41,241
Maybe you just can't see him.

00:34:43,514 --> 00:34:46,847
- You gonna take any pictures?
- Yeah.

Yeah? I've been looking for you.

Tried to get you on the two-way,
but I couldn't raise you.

608
00:35:55,253 --> 00:35:59,087
Well, I wasn't in my cruiser.
I rode my horse this time.

609
00:35:59,257 --> 00:36:00,884
See anything up there?

610
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:05,895
- No. A few tracks, but no mustangers.
- Mm-hmm.

611
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:08,329
Well, keep patrolling there,
but use the truck.

612
00:36:08,466 --> 00:36:09,694
I want you in communication.

613
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:12,302
This is a big county,
and there's only two of us.

614
00:36:12,436 --> 00:36:14,370
I have reports
on some riders up there.

615
00:36:14,472 --> 00:36:17,270
I think it's the mustangers
trying to trap some horses.

616
00:36:17,408 --> 00:36:18,432
Think it's Matty and her bunch?

617
00:36:18,543 --> 00:36:22,445
No. It's not from Matty's place.
It's not Ty or Dallas.

618
00:36:22,547 --> 00:36:25,914
I don't know who it is,
but I sure would like to know who it is.

Well, I'll stay on top of that, Sheriff.

- Saw who?
- BOTH: The Black Stallion!

00:37:15,466 --> 00:37:17,434
- Say that again?
- We saw him, Matty. It was amazing!

- Where?
- CJ: Starvation.

639
00:37:24,041 --> 00:37:27,010
About a half a dozen mares and colts.

640
00:37:27,144 --> 00:37:30,375
- Are you sure?
- I got pictures.

641
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:35,074
- CJ... you absolutely certain?
- Yes.

642
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:37,685
- You should have seen him, Matty.
- He's beautiful! Big, too!

Don't say anything.

Don't say anything to anyone.
Not a word. You understand?

646
00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:47,463
- Why?
- We just can't.

647
00:37:47,565 --> 00:37:49,795
- HANNAH: But we saw him!
- I know you did.

648
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:53,836
But nobody else can know
about this. At least, not for now.

649
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:58,071
Can you develop those pictures
by yourself, Hannah?

650
00:37:58,209 --> 00:38:00,734
No. I mean, I could if I had my stuff,
but not out here.

651
00:38:00,911 --> 00:38:03,004
Okay, well, you can't
get them developed. Not now.

652

Why? This is what I came for!

653
00:38:04,582 --> 00:38:07,415
Well, sometimes you have to sacrifice
what you want for the greater good.

654
00:38:07,585 --> 00:38:08,711
But they're just pictures.
Who will see them?

655
00:38:08,886 --> 00:38:10,854
Well, maybe nobody.
That's not the point.

656
00:38:11,989 --> 00:38:13,616
If word gets out about this,

657
00:38:13,758 --> 00:38:17,353
mustangers will be all over
this range like a bad suit.

658
00:38:17,495 --> 00:38:19,656
- What are mustanger?
- Rustlers.

659
00:38:19,897 --> 00:38:21,762
More or less.

660
00:38:21,932 --> 00:38:25,129
They use a Judas horse and
range traps to catch the wild ones.

661
00:38:25,369 --> 00:38:29,032
- A Judas what?
- Judas horse. It's what they're called.

662
00:38:29,206 --> 00:38:32,403
A horse trained
to mingle with the wild mustangs

663
00:38:32,543 --> 00:38:34,568
and lead them into the traps.

664
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:38,115
Trapped horses are then sold
or auctioned off to buyers

665
00:38:38,249 --> 00:38:40,513
and never seen again.

666
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:42,843
Sometimes they end up as dog food,

667
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:47,457
sometimes things even worse
I don't want to think about.

668
00:38:47,591 --> 00:38:51,083
If you're right
and that stallion is out there,

669
00:38:51,195 --> 00:38:56,394
every bootjack, scurvy, low-life one of
them will swoop down here after him.

670
00:38:56,534 --> 00:38:57,762
Is he worth that much?

671
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:01,528
More.

672
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:05,200
That stallion
is the Holy Grail of wild horses,

673
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:08,244
the last of the wild stallions
to join up with them.

674
00:39:09,814 --> 00:39:12,078
He <i>is</i> the legend.

675
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:17,553
And proof of that

676
00:39:17,655 --> 00:39:21,147
is in your camera.

678
00:39:30,668 --> 00:39:32,192
You ain't staying, are you?

679
00:39:32,336 --> 00:39:33,564
Maybe.

680
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:35,002
I don't remember inviting you.

681
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:37,664
You don't remember your own initials.

Everybody's a comedian around here.

683
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:42,807
You been a cook long?

684
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,447
Depends on what you consider long.

685
00:39:44,782 --> 00:39:46,272
I consider years long.

686
00:39:47,451 --> 00:39:50,477
Then I've been here two of them.

687
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:55,792
Alvin, Dallas and Ty came to help
Matty when her husband was killed.

688
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,222
What happened to him?

689
00:39:57,461 --> 00:39:59,691
Truck rollover.

690
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:01,559
Never seen Matty so hurt.

691
00:40:02,266 --> 00:40:04,029
I know how she feels.

692
00:40:04,168 --> 00:40:05,726
- Your mom?
- Yeah.

693
00:40:06,604 --> 00:40:11,268
- What happened to your mom?
- Cancer. Three years ago.

694
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:15,004
- I'm sorry.
- Me, too.

695
00:40:15,146 --> 00:40:18,877
I think she's watching me
sometimes, you know?

696
00:40:19,049 --> 00:40:22,712
It's like I can feel her just behind
my shoulder when I'm taking a picture.

697
00:40:22,853 --> 00:40:24,980
- She taught you?
- Yeah.

698
00:40:25,189 --> 00:40:27,657
You like the wild horses?

699
00:40:29,026 --> 00:40:31,688
Yeah. I think they're like my mom...

700
00:40:31,796 --> 00:40:33,821
kind of heavenly.

701
00:40:33,998 --> 00:40:36,228
It's a good way to say it.

702
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:40,703
Maybe...

703
00:40:40,838 --> 00:40:44,467
...your mom sends
the wild horses to show you.

704
00:40:44,742 --> 00:40:48,735
- Show me what?
- What heaven's like.

708
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,091
...it's supposed to.

709
00:41:04,895 --> 00:41:06,419
Yeah.

710
00:41:06,597 --> 00:41:09,725
Never thought of it that way.

711
00:41:10,868 --> 00:41:13,837
I do.

712
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:15,700

Dallas... here's the film I took.

715
00:42:07,758 --> 00:42:10,386
Can you take it to the drugstore
tomorrow to get it developed?

716
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:13,793
- Yeah, I'll take it. Throw it over there.
- Thanks.

717
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:21,596
So, what you doing?

718
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:23,431
Working.

720
00:42:25,509 --> 00:42:26,806
Yeah.

721
00:42:26,911 --> 00:42:29,311
Got to keep the tack
in working order on a ranch.

722
00:42:29,446 --> 00:42:30,913
What's "tack"?

723
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:32,811
What you call the gear.

724
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:36,784
Saddles, the bridles, the leather stuff.

725
00:42:36,921 --> 00:42:38,513
Why is it called "tack"?

726
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:40,850
'Cause that's what it's called.

727
00:42:40,991 --> 00:42:43,255
You are
a fountain of knowledge, Alvin.

728
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:46,818
That he is.
Mr. Know-It-All.

729
00:42:46,964 --> 00:42:49,797
Some people drink
at the fountain of knowledge

730
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,232
and others just gargle.

731
00:42:53,871 --> 00:42:55,463
It's called "tack"
because that was the original name

732
00:42:55,639 --> 00:42:58,335
for the horse harness,
bridle and saddle.

733
00:42:58,709 --> 00:43:02,543
Hey, you two see anything
up at Starvation yesterday?

Yeah.

What?

736
00:43:06,483 --> 00:43:08,849
A few mustangs,
and I got some pictures.

737
00:43:09,019 --> 00:43:09,986
How many?

738
00:43:10,988 --> 00:43:13,889
- Pictures or mustangs?
- TY: Mustangs.

- HANNAH: Oh, right.
- CJ: Um... just a few.

HANNAH: Has Matty always
tried to save the mustangs?

741
00:43:21,031 --> 00:43:22,999
Yep. Only one who has.

742
00:43:23,167 --> 00:43:26,159
That's why we work for her.
She cares.

743
00:43:26,303 --> 00:43:28,703
How many people around here do?

744
00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:31,205
Will you, uh, hand me that bridle?

745
00:43:31,342 --> 00:43:34,368
That one over there.
It has the "W H" on it.

746
00:43:34,478 --> 00:43:35,843
Thanks, CJ.

747
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:38,506
- This one?
- CJ: Yeah.

748
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:45,353
- So, are they hard to fix?
- Nah.

749
00:43:45,689 --> 00:43:48,783
That's 'cause he don't really fix 'em.

750
00:43:48,926 --> 00:43:52,293
You don't even know which end
of the horse the bridle goes on.

751
00:43:52,429 --> 00:43:54,329
Do too. The front end.

752
00:43:54,498 --> 00:43:55,590
Which matches your back end.

753
00:43:55,766 --> 00:43:57,324
Well, why don't you just, uh,

754
00:43:57,434 --> 00:44:01,734

with the flyswatter or something?

- Rope what?
- Yeah.

- CJ: Come on.

- Okay.
- See you later.

See you, guys.

762
00:44:18,555 --> 00:44:22,548
Alvin, you ever stopped to think
and then forget to start again?

763
00:44:22,726 --> 00:44:27,686
You know what happens
to your laugh if you stand up?

764
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:32,632
I know what you two are trying to do,
and I ain't fallin' for it.

765

Okay. We can't fool you, can we?

Not hardly.

Hey, Dallas, did you, uh,
did you see that story on the news?

768
00:44:41,979 --> 00:44:42,604
Which one?

769
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:45,510
The one where every 30 seconds in
this country a man has a heart attack.

770
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:49,018
- Is that true?
- DALLAS: How does that man survive?

771

Nobody knows.

since you've been out here, Dallas?

Nope. Haven't been looking, though.

00:46:16,406 --> 00:46:18,306
- Got a hat?
- HANNAH: What kind of hat?

780
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:23,106
Cowboy hat, and, uh, you're gonna
need some new clothes, too.

- Well, you're not.

They think they're so smart.

When you work out here,
you got to have the right gear, savvy?

785
00:46:35,092 --> 00:46:36,457
- What's that mean?
- DALLAS: What's what mean?

786
00:46:36,593 --> 00:46:38,823
- "Savvy."
- Comes from the Spanish.

787
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:40,862
It's an Americanization
of the word <i>"saber,"</i>

788

to know or understand... <i>sabe.</i>

"savvy."

00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:57,977
- CJ: He's bigger than I thought.
- HANNAH: He's beautiful.

853
00:51:58,115 --> 00:52:00,549
- Do you think that's really him?
- Oh, it's him.

854
00:52:01,885 --> 00:52:07,687
Look at him... the way he moves.
He's so strong.

855
00:52:07,824 --> 00:52:08,950
Only if Matty were here...

856
00:52:09,826 --> 00:52:10,815
I know.

857

[Horse neighs]

00:53:04,581 --> 00:53:07,641
[Dog barks]

859
00:53:08,885 --> 00:53:11,445
Hello, Matty.

860
00:53:11,555 --> 00:53:13,716
Buck?

861
00:53:15,458 --> 00:53:17,949
Keeping busy, huh?

862
00:53:18,094 --> 00:53:19,288
How's that?

863
00:53:19,663 --> 00:53:23,258
Well, Morg tells me that you've
been searching around Horseshoe.

864
00:53:24,801 --> 00:53:25,927
It's my range.

865
00:53:26,102 --> 00:53:28,570
Yes, it is indeed.

866
00:53:31,441 --> 00:53:33,875
You got something to say, Buck, say it.

867
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:38,674
I just don't want you to make a big
stink about it all over the county.

868
00:53:38,848 --> 00:53:40,873
No stink here,

869
00:53:41,017 --> 00:53:42,746
present company excepted.

870
00:53:42,953 --> 00:53:46,514
Oh, oh, oh... let me stop
the bleeding a second.

871
00:53:46,656 --> 00:53:48,283
Ooh, much better.

872
00:53:48,692 --> 00:53:52,492
Look, Buck, I noticed there
weren't any horses up there at all.

873
00:53:52,596 --> 00:53:54,757
Now, doesn't that strike you
as a bit odd?

874
00:53:54,965 --> 00:53:56,694
Matty, I'm sorry to tell you this,

875
00:53:56,866 --> 00:53:59,630
but just about everything
around you strikes me as odd.

876
00:53:59,936 --> 00:54:04,566
- Not me. The mustangs.
- I know. I know.

877
00:54:04,708 --> 00:54:08,337
- I got Morg checking on it for you.
- I don't trust him either.

878
00:54:08,545 --> 00:54:12,003
- You don't trust anybody, Matty.
- I trust you'll say something stupid.

879
00:54:12,182 --> 00:54:17,449
Oh, Matty. Matty, in an ever-changing
universe, you are my one constant,

880
00:54:17,621 --> 00:54:20,681
my shining star.

881
00:54:26,329 --> 00:54:29,162
[Thunder rumbles]

882
00:54:33,169 --> 00:54:35,660
<i>HANNAH, OFF SCREEN:</i>
<i>Matty loved the wild herd,</i>

883
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:38,069
<i>more than almost anything.</i>

884
00:54:38,208 --> 00:54:40,039
<i>She'd always been their champion,</i>

885
00:54:40,143 --> 00:54:42,077
<i>but since her husband</i>
<i>had passed away,</i>

886
00:54:42,212 --> 00:54:45,306
<i>the horses became</i>
<i>even more important to her.</i>

887
00:54:46,349 --> 00:54:50,251
<i>I think she searched every inch</i>
<i>of Horseshoe Mountain that day.</i>

888
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:54,049
<i>One thing I learned about Matty...</i>
<i>she was determined.</i>

889
00:54:54,157 --> 00:54:57,718
<i>Once she made up her mind,</i>
<i>nothing could stop her.</i>

890
00:54:58,495 --> 00:55:02,397
<i>But the one place she didn't look</i>
<i>that day was at Starvation Canyon,</i>

891
00:55:03,433 --> 00:55:06,994
<i>and that's where</i>
<i>The Wild Stallion's herd was.</i>

892
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:12,604
CJ: Mom's are the best.

893
00:55:13,443 --> 00:55:16,071
CJ: Oh, crap!
Rodeo Club's gonna kill me!

894
00:55:16,179 --> 00:55:16,907
HANNAH: What?

895
00:55:17,047 --> 00:55:19,743
CJ: I missed practice today
for the rodeo and parade.

896
00:55:19,916 --> 00:55:22,476
Practice again on Tuesday,
and you're going with me.

897
00:55:22,619 --> 00:55:25,417
HANNAH: Okay.

898
00:55:34,798 --> 00:55:36,356
- That was fun, huh.
- Yeah.

899
00:55:36,566 --> 00:55:37,624
See you tomorrow?

900
00:55:37,767 --> 00:55:41,032
First thing. We'll go up to Starvation
and get some more pictures.

901
00:55:41,137 --> 00:55:43,367
- Breakfast is at 6:00.
- In the morning?

902
00:55:43,573 --> 00:55:44,631
We start early around here.

903
00:55:44,774 --> 00:55:47,299
- That's not early. That's ugly.
- CJ: Well, get used to it.

904
00:55:47,477 --> 00:55:50,037
- See you in the morning.
- By the way, you can't have one.

905
00:55:50,213 --> 00:55:52,511
- What? Breakfast?
- No, bath.

906
00:55:52,682 --> 00:55:54,149
- No bath?
- ALVIN: No bath.

907
00:55:54,284 --> 00:55:55,080
Why?

908
00:55:55,485 --> 00:55:57,476
- Bathtub ain't available.
- How come?

909
00:55:57,754 --> 00:55:59,449
'Cause the transmission.

910
00:55:59,656 --> 00:56:01,419
There's a transmission
in the bathtub?

911
00:56:01,624 --> 00:56:02,750
You seen it, too, didn't you?

912
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:07,120
- So, she can't take a bath?
- No.

913
00:56:08,665 --> 00:56:11,065
- But she can take a shower.
- Well, why didn't you say so?

914
00:56:11,267 --> 00:56:14,259
I just did!

915
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:18,037
I don't believe it.

916
00:56:18,174 --> 00:56:21,735
I didn't either
until my cousin showed me that.

917
00:56:21,878 --> 00:56:26,144
- The Stallion does exist.
- HARDY: Matty probably knows.

918
00:56:26,282 --> 00:56:28,682
That don't mean nothing.

919
00:56:28,818 --> 00:56:32,652
VIRGIL:
We gonna get him, Morg?

920
00:56:33,256 --> 00:56:34,780
No.

921
00:56:34,958 --> 00:56:37,688
No, not we. Me.

922
00:56:38,094 --> 00:56:43,122
MORG: When I get this Black Stallion,
Novak's gonna pay through the nose.

923
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:48,170
Well, what about us?
The stud's worth a lot, ain't he?

924
00:56:48,271 --> 00:56:51,297
What about you, Virg?

925
00:56:51,474 --> 00:56:55,069
Nothing, Morg. I was just
wondering about our share, that's all.

926
00:56:55,211 --> 00:56:57,372
Your share is
what I say your share is.

927
00:56:57,547 --> 00:57:00,380
- HARDY: And what would that be?
- VIRGIL: Yeah?

928
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:02,643
MORGAN:
Oh, you, too, Hardy?

929
00:57:02,752 --> 00:57:06,688
He's right. We're doing the work
and taking the chances, Morg.

930
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:09,384
Buck, he thinks you're the
number-one boy doing good and all,

931
00:57:09,559 --> 00:57:12,084
but...

932
00:57:12,228 --> 00:57:15,823
...we should make something
out of this, too, that's all.

933
00:57:15,999 --> 00:57:17,762
And you will.

934
00:57:17,901 --> 00:57:19,198
You will.

935
00:57:19,302 --> 00:57:21,827
You'll make
exactly what I say you make.

936
00:57:22,005 --> 00:57:25,839
- How much?
- Don't push it, Hardy!

937
00:57:26,009 --> 00:57:28,068
You'll get what you get.

938
00:57:28,211 --> 00:57:30,475
That's the end of the discussion.

939
00:57:30,613 --> 00:57:31,978
Savvy?

940
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:35,551
HARDY: No point in losing your
temper, Morg... it was a fair question.

941
00:57:35,685 --> 00:57:38,882
MORGAN:
No, I'll say what's fair, Hardy.

942
00:57:39,055 --> 00:57:40,818
Now, you two get
this black-widow maker corralled.

943
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:43,892
I'm gonna call Novak
and let him know.

944
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:47,518
And then we can talk money.

945
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:52,196
What, do you want to dance?
Get out of here!

946
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:56,068
HARDY: Let's go, Virg.

947
00:57:56,206 --> 00:57:58,538
HARDY: Virg!

948
00:57:58,675 --> 00:58:01,701
- That way.
- Okay.

950
00:58:22,365 --> 00:58:23,627
Something's up with Matty.

951
00:58:23,766 --> 00:58:26,826
Yeah, something's
always up with Matty.

952
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:30,735
Dallas, have you been
up to Horseshoe lately?

953
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:32,271
Not in a couple of weeks. Why?

954
00:58:32,442 --> 00:58:36,344
I was just there. Didn't see
a family group. Not one mustang.

955
00:58:36,479 --> 00:58:37,707
Nothing?

956
00:58:37,814 --> 00:58:40,374
There were nearly a hundred head
up there about, what, three weeks ago.

957
00:58:40,617 --> 00:58:43,142
I know. Doesn't sit right, does it?

958
00:58:43,286 --> 00:58:45,777
Well, we're going to town
right after we're done here.

959
00:58:45,955 --> 00:58:47,946
We can check it out after that
if you'd like.

960
00:58:48,124 --> 00:58:49,921
It couldn't hurt.

961
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:53,723
Here we go again.

962
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:39,841
DALLAS:
Those are deep tracks.

963
00:59:40,043 --> 00:59:43,206
Something heavy
has been hauled up here.

964
00:59:43,379 --> 00:59:45,870
I think it's time we paid
a visit to the deputy sheriff.

965
00:59:46,015 --> 00:59:48,916
TY: About time.

966
01:00:01,064 --> 01:00:03,862
[Horses neigh]

967
01:00:09,372 --> 01:00:11,499
- Gentlemen.
- Morg.

968
01:00:11,741 --> 01:00:12,867
What can I do for you?

969
01:00:13,009 --> 01:00:15,876
DALLAS: Well, seems all the
wild horses have gone missing.

970
01:00:16,012 --> 01:00:17,877
So then we figured...

971
01:00:17,981 --> 01:00:19,972
...you being the deputy sheriff and all,
you might have heard something.

972
01:00:20,216 --> 01:00:23,549
Is that right?

973
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:25,984
- You've seen them around here?
- No.

974
01:00:27,423 --> 01:00:28,481
Yeah, me neither.

975
01:00:29,025 --> 01:00:31,653
Morg, we'd hate for someone
we know to be... responsible.

976
01:00:34,097 --> 01:00:37,294
Well, I'm sure that's not the case.

977
01:00:37,433 --> 01:00:40,402
But it ain't your job to worry about it.

978
01:00:40,503 --> 01:00:42,971
It's mine.

979
01:00:44,941 --> 01:00:46,408
Gentlemen.

980
01:00:46,542 --> 01:00:48,601
Let us know if you hear anything.

Morg.

982
01:01:12,869 --> 01:01:13,631
CJ, READING ALOUD:
Even in modern days,

983
01:01:13,803 --> 01:01:17,569
free-roaming horses are known to
have joined the domesticated animals,

984
01:01:17,740 --> 01:01:19,765
such as the case
of the most famous of these,

985
01:01:19,909 --> 01:01:22,207
Kentucky Derby winner Dark Cloud,

986
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:23,937
which is said to have escaped
during a train derailment

987
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:26,776
on the Utah-Nevada border.

988
01:01:26,916 --> 01:01:29,783
That Wild Stallion's
unbroken spirit lives on.

989
01:01:29,919 --> 01:01:32,717
Many claim The Wild Stallion
is partial to carrots,

990
01:01:32,855 --> 01:01:35,847
which has given rise
to a tradition of hanging carrots out.

991
01:01:35,992 --> 01:01:39,484
CJ: I think we could get the stallion
to come down if we did something.

992
01:01:39,629 --> 01:01:40,459
HANNAH: What?

993
01:01:40,563 --> 01:01:43,498
- CJ: Carrots.
- HANNAH: Carrots?

994
01:01:43,633 --> 01:01:46,898
CJ: Yeah. Hanging them out as bait.

995
01:01:47,003 --> 01:01:48,595
HANNAH: Isn't that like cheating?

996
01:01:48,771 --> 01:01:52,730
CJ: Only if you were
trying to trap him. We're not.

997
01:01:53,810 --> 01:01:56,335
- How come carrots?
- I read about it.

998
01:01:56,479 --> 01:01:58,606
The Stallion loves carrots.

999
01:01:58,781 --> 01:02:00,408
It's worth a try, huh?

1000
01:02:00,516 --> 01:02:03,485
- From your mouth to God's ear.
- What does that mean?

1001
01:02:03,653 --> 01:02:05,985
Oh, just something
my grandma used to say.

1002
01:02:07,356 --> 01:02:09,017
When someone says something
that you want to happen,

1003
01:02:09,158 --> 01:02:12,491
people use an old Yiddish blessing,
"from your mouth to God's ear."

1004
01:02:12,628 --> 01:02:16,029
- People say that a lot in Ohio?
- If they're from Lithuania.

1005
01:02:16,232 --> 01:02:18,427
Oh.

1006
01:02:19,969 --> 01:02:21,459
Almost noon.

1007
01:02:22,538 --> 01:02:24,005
How do you know?
You don't have a watch.

1008
01:02:24,741 --> 01:02:27,335
The sun.

1009
01:02:27,477 --> 01:02:28,876
During the summer solstice,

1010
01:02:29,011 --> 01:02:31,411
the sun is directly overhead
in the Northern Hemisphere,

1011
01:02:31,547 --> 01:02:37,144
but with MDT, its position
is about... oh, 11:00 in the sky.

1012
01:02:37,386 --> 01:02:39,513
- MDT?
- Mountain Daylight Time.

1013
01:02:39,655 --> 01:02:42,488
Oh, yeah. Right.

1014
01:02:42,959 --> 01:02:44,517
You want to go up
and see if he comes down?

1015
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:46,594
Sure. Will Matty care?

1016
01:02:46,829 --> 01:02:49,320
I don't see why she would.
We're just going to watch.

1017
01:02:49,532 --> 01:02:51,591
Yeah. Maybe I could
get some more pictures.

1018
01:02:52,068 --> 01:02:54,229
- Yeah. Come on.
- Okay.

1019
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:12,018

01:16:58,714 --> 01:17:01,182
- We need help, CJ.
- Yeah.

1191
01:17:01,350 --> 01:17:03,614
And evidence.

1192
01:17:03,785 --> 01:17:05,912
- Take a picture!
- HANNAH: Good idea!

1193
01:17:08,090 --> 01:17:10,615
Load him up.
I want him out-of-state by tonight.

1194
01:17:10,792 --> 01:17:12,123
Not a problem.

1195
01:17:12,728 --> 01:17:13,888
[Shutter clicks]

1196
01:17:14,529 --> 01:17:16,690
Mr. Novak: One nice package.

1197
01:17:19,234 --> 01:17:20,394
Take me to the plane.

1198
01:17:22,037 --> 01:17:23,504
Aren't you forgetting something?

1199
01:17:31,747 --> 01:17:34,341
Sure nice doing business
with you, Mr. Novak.

1200
01:17:34,483 --> 01:17:35,575
May I go now?

1201
01:17:36,685 --> 01:17:38,653
I'll have Virg take you back. Virg...

1202
01:17:41,323 --> 01:17:43,917
Hardy, get over here.

1203
01:17:46,561 --> 01:17:48,722
Now, I want you to stay here
and watch the trailers.

1204
01:17:48,897 --> 01:17:51,092
I've got to go check in,
or Buck's gonna get suspicious.

1205
01:17:51,333 --> 01:17:54,860
What do we do? There's no time
to get Matty, Dallas, or Ty.

1206
01:17:55,003 --> 01:17:59,667
No.
I know! It's Tuesday! Rodeo Club!

1207
01:17:59,841 --> 01:18:01,968
You keep taking pictures.
I'll be right back.

[Stallion neighs loudly]

1210
01:18:19,361 --> 01:18:21,556
What are they saying?

1211
01:18:21,797 --> 01:18:24,994
CJ: That his truck's on fire.

1212
01:18:30,372 --> 01:18:31,634
CJ: Come on.

1213
01:18:44,019 --> 01:18:45,145
[Stallion snorts]

1214
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:47,481
- Where do we take him?
- Away.

1215
01:18:48,023 --> 01:18:49,422
MORG:
What are you doing with my horses?

1216
01:18:49,624 --> 01:18:51,649
You weren't gonna
steal my horse, were you girls?

1217
01:18:51,893 --> 01:18:54,487
- He's not yours! Stop!
- Well, he's not yours, either!

1218
01:18:54,763 --> 01:18:56,526
He's not yours, either!

1219
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:00,425
Sheriff Thompson, Wayne County,

1220
01:19:00,836 --> 01:19:04,932
has probably got Virg and
that big-shot tycoon of yours already.

1221
01:19:05,073 --> 01:19:06,665
- Yeah, but how?
- How?

1222
01:19:06,842 --> 01:19:08,434
If you were any kind of a lawman,

1223
01:19:08,710 --> 01:19:11,611
you would know
that county cars leave county tracks.

1224
01:19:11,713 --> 01:19:14,682
I had my suspicions,
I just needed proof.

1225
01:19:14,850 --> 01:19:16,010
Here's some more.

1226
01:19:16,151 --> 01:19:17,743
Thank you, little lady.

1227
01:19:17,919 --> 01:19:22,822
- I hope they aren't blurry.
- Come here, you!

1228
01:19:22,924 --> 01:19:25,552
[Horse neighs]

1229
01:19:44,679 --> 01:19:45,839
Guess you heard.

1230
01:19:46,948 --> 01:19:47,972
Heard about what?

1231
01:19:48,583 --> 01:19:51,643
Buck arrested Morg this afternoon.
You were right.

1232
01:19:52,187 --> 01:19:54,849
He got Virg Billings
and Hardy Johnson, too.

1233
01:19:54,956 --> 01:19:56,480
They were all in on it together.

1234
01:19:56,625 --> 01:20:01,585
Hardy and Virg...
Sounds about right.

1235
01:20:01,763 --> 01:20:04,664
You know, folks are saying he's yours.

1236
01:20:04,766 --> 01:20:05,858
Well, they're wrong.

1237
01:20:06,968 --> 01:20:07,935
He's not mine.

1238
01:20:09,104 --> 01:20:11,231
He doesn't belong to anybody.

1239
01:20:11,406 --> 01:20:14,000
He's free, like he should be.

1240
01:20:15,610 --> 01:20:18,374
So, uh, what are you gonna do now?

1241
01:20:19,848 --> 01:20:21,247
I'm gonna finish fixing the fence.

1242
01:20:21,349 --> 01:20:23,010

<i>HANNAH, OFF SCREEN:</i>
<i>It was a magical summer for me,</i>

1245
01:20:51,580 --> 01:20:53,844
<i>and it was over way too soon.</i>

1246
01:20:54,015 --> 01:20:56,779
<i>Dallas and Ty kept</i>
<i>playing their jokes on poor Alvin.</i>

[Laughs]

1248

1252

<i>But Alvin actually got the last laugh</i>
<i>on the brothers that same day.</i>

1253
01:21:22,777 --> 01:21:27,510
<i>Both Ty and Dallas were crazy</i>
<i>about Matty's friend, Ellie.</i>

1254
01:21:27,616 --> 01:21:31,518
<i>Alvin appeared and took Ellie</i>
<i>for a walk, right under their noses.</i>

1255
01:21:31,686 --> 01:21:34,086
<i>Ty and Dallas</i>
<i>never even saw it coming.</i>

1256
01:21:34,222 --> 01:21:35,814
What?

1257
01:21:37,425 --> 01:21:39,017
Doesn't even make sense!

1258
01:21:39,194 --> 01:21:41,958
He's a cook!
And his nose is stuck to his finger!

1259
01:21:42,063 --> 01:21:45,897
<i>Later I heard that Alvin and Ellie</i>
<i>really hit it off.</i>

1260
01:21:46,067 --> 01:21:50,333
<i>She helped him unglue his hand</i>

<i>The day I was leaving,</i>
<i>Daddy came to pick me up,</i>

1262

<i>and Matty wasn't around.</i>

1263
01:21:59,014 --> 01:22:00,606
I'll miss you.

1264
01:22:00,749 --> 01:22:03,217
<i>I said goodbye to everybody.</i>

1265
01:22:03,318 --> 01:22:05,786
<i>I was really going to miss them.</i>

1266
01:22:05,954 --> 01:22:08,479
<i>I'd been so wrong about coming there.</i>

1267
01:22:09,591 --> 01:22:12,924
<i>Ty and Dallas said goodbye.</i>

1268
01:22:17,666 --> 01:22:21,432

<i>Whoa! She looked good!</i>

1269
01:22:22,103 --> 01:22:23,730

1270

<i>CJ was chosen</i>

<i>and we both got to ride in it.</i>

01:22:54,369 --> 01:22:55,961

1278
01:22:56,071 --> 01:22:59,097

<i>We never saw</i>

1280
01:23:21,329 --> 01:23:23,194
<i>I think he led them out of Starvation</i>

<i>and over the mountains</i>
<i>back to Nevada.</i>

1282
