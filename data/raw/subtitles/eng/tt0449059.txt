<i>Tara Dawn Holland!</i>

00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:27,100
<i>There are two kinds of people in this world,</i>

10
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:30,200
<i>winners and losers.</i>

11
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,200
Inside each and every one of you,

12
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:36,700
at the very core of your being,

13
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,700
is a winner waiting to be awakened

14
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,000
and unleashed upon the world.

15
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:46,200
With my 9-step "Refuse to Lose" program,

16
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:50,100
you now have the necessary
tools and the insights

17
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,500
and the know-how to put
your losing habits behind you

18
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,900
and to go out and make
your dreams come true.

19
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,000
No hesitating.

20
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,800
No complaining.

21
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,000
And no excuses.

22
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,400
I want you to go out in the world

23
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,000
and I want you to be winners!

24
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,000
Thank you.

25
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,100
Thank you.

26
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,700
<i>I'm on my way.</i>

27
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,700
I don't know how long.

28
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,000
I don't know!

29
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,100
Richard, he has nowhere else to go.

30
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:50,500
I'm not smoking. I'm not!

31
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,200
Look, I'm at the hospital.

32
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,300
Yeah, okay, bye.

33
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:22,600
Miss Hoover? Your brother's fine.

34
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,400
I need you to keep him away
from sharp objects, knives, scissors.

35
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:30,700
If you have medications, depressants
in your house, keep them secure.

36
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,300
- I'd prefer to keep him, but...
- I know. The insurance.

37
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,300
You want to see him?

38
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,400
Hey, Frank.

39
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,900
Sheryl.

40
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,800
I'm so glad you're still here.

41
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,700
Well, that makes one of us.

42
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,100
<i>A strong low pressure system
passed across New Mexico tonight</i>

43
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,200
<i>bringing with it a little moisture
that will cool things off a bit.</i>

44
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,900
<i>We may even see a 5 to 10 degree drop
in temperatures in Albuquerque.</i>

45
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,500
<i>There will be no significant
accumulations of rainfall...</i>

46
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,700
You want to talk or no?

47
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,000
No.

48
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,200
Hello?

49
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,200
Anyone?

50
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,700
Down here. We have you with Dwayne.

51
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,400
Dwayne, hi. Uncle Frank's here.

52
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:01,100
He doesn't mind, Frank. We talked.

53
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:08,000
I know, I know. But we can't have you
sleeping alone. The doctor said.

54
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,300
I'm sorry. I have to insist.

55
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,500
You'll get along fine. He's really quiet.

56
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,200
And here's your cot.

57
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Please, Frank.

58
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,400
Please.

59
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,600
Thank you.

60
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,800
I'm gonna start dinner.

61
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,300
You can come out when you're settled.

62
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:42,000
And... just leave the door open.

63
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,400
That's important.

64
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,900
Dwayne, honey, there's a bucket
of chicken in the car. Can you get it?

65
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,300
And I'll make a salad.

66
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,600
- Olive?
<i>- Yeah?</i>

67
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,600
- Is Grandpa with you?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

68
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:06,000
- What are you guys doing?
- <i>Rehearsing.</i>

69
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:09,000
- Okay, well, dinner in 10 minutes.
- <i>Okay.</i>

70
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,400
- Hi.
- Hi. Frank's here.

71
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,600
Oh, God! Did Stan Grossman call?

72
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,000
Well, check the machine.

73
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:22,600
Dwayne, please, come on.
The chicken. It's in the car.

74
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,200
Will you set the table?
We'll just do paper plates tonight.

75
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:28,000
<i>She was runner-up in the regional
Little Miss Sunshine.</i>

76
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:32,400
- <i>Well, they just called right now...</i>
- Hey, it's your sister!

77
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,800
Fuck!

78
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:46,200
Hi. Richard Hoover
for Stan Grossman, please.

79
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,800
Any way to reach him or...

80
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,200
Well, I'm just wondering
if this darn book deal is done or not.

81
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,000
If...

82
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,800
Yes. Okay, okay.

83
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,200
Could you please just have him
call me anytime over the weekend?

84
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,000
He has my cell number.

85
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,200
Just to let me know we're on.

86
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,000
Okay? Thank you. Bye.

87
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,100
- So, what happened with Stan Grossman?
- He's in Scottsdale.

88
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,400
Why didn't he call?

89
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,300
Will you let me worry about this, please?

90
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,700
Dwayne, can you check on Frank?
Tell him it's dinnertime.

91
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:25,500
- Olive, dinnertime!
- <i>Coming!</i>

92
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,700
What? Dinner?

93
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,800
What, you don't talk anymore?

94
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Why not?

95
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,200
You can talk. You just choose not to.

96
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,200
Is that Nietzsche?

97
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:58,100
You don't speak because
of Friedrich Nietzsche.

98
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,500
Far out.

99
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Frank, you can sit here next to Dwayne.

100
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:20,000
Here's the salad, and I'm gonna run
and get Sprite for everyone.

101
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:26,000
- Olive, come on, dinnertime!
-  <i>Okay.</i>

102
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,500
So, who do you hang out with?

103
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,400
No one?

104
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,900
What about your family?

105
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:05,000
- Frank, hey!
- Richard.

106
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,400
- Good to... see you.
- Yes.

107
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,000
Let me get Olive.

108
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:25,000
- Olive? Dad?
- You guys, go on and start.

109
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,000
- Let's go!
- <i>We're coming.</i>

110
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,100
- Frank, some Sprite?
- Yes.

111
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,700
And I want everyone to have
at least a little salad.

112
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Thanks, Sheryl.

113
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,000
Honey.

114
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:45,700
So, Sheryl, I couldn't help noticing
Dwayne has stopped speaking.

115
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,800
Yeah, he's taken a vow of silence.

116
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
You've taken a vow of silence?

117
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,800
He's gonna join the Air Force Academy,
become a test pilot,

118
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,100
and he's taken a vow of silence
until he reaches that goal.

119
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,700
You're kidding!

120
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,800
- Hi, Uncle Frank.
- Oh, hey, Olive.

121
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,600
Wow, you're getting big!

122
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,500
Almost like a real person.

123
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,800
- What happened to your arms?
- Olive!

124
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,100
That's all right. I had a little accident. I'm okay.

125
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,500
How's the routine coming, honey?

126
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,800
- It's good.
- Yeah?

127
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:17,900
When are you gonna show it to us?

128
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,200
I don't know. It's up to Grandpa.

129
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,800
A couple of days. It still needs work.

130
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,700
What's that, chicken?
Every night it's the fucking chicken!

131
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,500
- Holy God Almighty!
- Dad!

132
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,600
- Is it possible just once we could get...
- Dad!

133
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,900
...something to eat for dinner around here...

134
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,500
- ...that's not the goddamn fucking chicken?
- Hey!

135
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,600
Hey, Dad!

136
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,600
- I'm just saying!
- Dad!

137
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,900
Christ!

138
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Whenever you want to start cooking
your own food, you're more than welcome.

139
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,200
- At Sunset Manor, you know...
- If you like Sunset Manor so much,

140
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,500
you shouldn't have gotten yourself
kicked out of there, right?

141
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,400
For God's sakes!

142
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:53,000
So, when did you start with the vow?

143
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,400
Been nine months, Frank.
He hasn't said a word.

144
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,000
Not one.

145
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,300
I think it shows tremendous discipline.

146
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,600
- Richard.
- I really do!

147
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:06,300
Really! I think we could learn
something from Dwayne.

148
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:10,000
Dwayne has a goal.
He has a dream.

149
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,600
It may not be my dream,
it may not be yours...

150
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:16,100
But he's pursuing it with
great conviction and focus.

151
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,100
In fact, I was thinking about the 9 steps--

152
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,900
Oh, for crying out loud!

153
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,700
About the 9 steps, and how
Dwayne's utilizing at least 7 of them

154
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,100
in his personal quest to self-fulfillment.

155
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,600
- Richard, please.
- Well...

156
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,700
I'm just saying I've come around.

157
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,700
I think he could use our support.

158
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,000
How did it happen?

159
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:37,100
- How did what happen?
- Your accident.

160
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,000
- Honey, here.
- Oh, no, it's okay.

161
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,200
- Unless you object.
- Mm-mm.

162
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:46,500
No, I'm pro-honesty here.
I just think, you know, it's up to you.

163
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,000
Be my guest.

164
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,500
Olive, Uncle Frank didn't
really have an accident.

165
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:59,300
What happened was he...
tried to kill himself.

166
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,800
You did?! Why?!

167
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,900
I'm sorry. I don't think this is
an appropriate conversation.

168
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Honey, let's let Uncle Frank
finish his dinner, okay?

169
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,000
Why did you wanna kill yourself?

170
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,900
- No, don't answer the question, Frank.
- Richard!

171
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
- Don't answer it.
- Richard!

172
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,200
He's not gonna answer the question, Frank.

173
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,100
- I wanted to kill myself...
- Don't listen to him, honey.

174
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,000
- ...because I was very unhappy.
- He's sick. He's a sick man.

175
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,200
- He's a sick in his head man.
- Richard!

176
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:25,600
I'm sorry! I don't think it's an appropriate
conversation for a 7-year-old.

177
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:28,000
- Well, she's gonna find out anyway.
- Oh, okay!

178
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,700
Go on, Frank.

179
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,000
Why were you unhappy?

180
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,700
Well, there are a lot of reasons.

181
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:44,800
Mainly, though, I fell in love with
someone who didn't love me back.

182
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,400
Who?

183
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,800
One of my grad students.
I was very much in love with him.

184
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,200
Him?!

185
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:56,400
It was a boy? You fell in love with a boy?

186
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,600
Yes, I did. Very much so.

187
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,900
That's silly.

188
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,700
You're right. It was silly.
It was very, very silly.

189
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,900
- There's another word for it.
- Dad!

190
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,900
- So, that's when you tried to kill yourself?
- Well, no.

191
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,500
The boy that I was in love with fell in love
with another man, Larry Sugarman.

192
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,900
- Who's Larry Sugarman?
- Larry Sugarman is, perhaps,

193
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,200
the second most highly regarded
Proust scholar in the U.S.

194
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:22,900
- Who's number one?
- That would be me, Rich.

195
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,400
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

196
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,600
- So, that's when.
- No.

197
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,100
What happened was I was a bit upset.

198
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,400
So, I said some things
that I shouldn't have said

199
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,500
and I did some things
that I shouldn't have done,

200
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,400
and subsequently I was fired from my job

201
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,700
and forced to move out of my apartment
and move into a motel.

202
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,400
- And that's when you tried to...
- Well, no.

203
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,700
Actually, all of that was okay.

204
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,900
What happened was two days ago
the MacArthur Foundation,

205
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,400
in its infinite wisdom,

206
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:57,000
awarded a genius grant to Larry Sugarman.

207
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,100
And that's when...

208
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,800
Decided to check out early.

209
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:06,500
Yes, yes. And I failed at that as well.

210
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,600
Olive, the important thing
to understand here

211
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,900
is that Uncle Frank gave up on himself.

212
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,900
He made a series of foolish choices,
I'm sorry, and he gave up on himself,

213
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,400
which is something that winners never do.

214
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:23,500
So, that's the story, okay?
Now, everyone, just let's move on and...

215
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,500
Is he always like this?

216
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,800
How can you stand it?

217
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:31,500
Olive, tell him about your routine
while you're doing this.

218
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,800
Okay. Little Miss Chili Pepper is a beauty
contest for everyone in Albuquerque,

219
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:39,000
but you have to be 6 or 7
and you have to be a girl.

220
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,300
This is our sister.

221
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,900
- Cindy.
- Spring break.

222
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,200
Dwayne went to see his dad
in Florida for two weeks,

223
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,900
and Olive went to Laguna
to see her cousins.

224
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,600
She made it to the top
of the regionals out there.

225
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,400
I was in second place.

226
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,300
Well, what do you think your chances are?

227
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,600
I think I can win,
because some of the other girls,

228
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:01,100
they've been doing it longer,
but I practice every day.

229
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,000
- Yeah, good luck.
- Not about luck, Frank.

230
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,600
Luck is the name losers
give to their own failings.

231
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:09,400
It's about wanting to win,
willing yourself to win.

232
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,300
You've got to want it badder
than anybody else.

233
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,400
I do!

234
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,400
- Then you're gonna be a winner.
- Richard!

235
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,000
It's the truth.

236
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:20,000
You know, actually, there is a message
from Cindy on the machine.

237
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,200
Something about Little Mrs. Sunshine.

238
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,000
- Sunshine?
- What?

239
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,700
- Little Miss Sunshine?
- Yeah.

240
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,000
What?!

241
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,900
<i>Sheryl, it's Cindy.</i>

242
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,900
<i>Remember when Olive was here last month?</i>

243
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,400
<i>She was runner-up in the
regional Little Miss Sunshine?</i>

244
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:43,000
<i>Well, they just called right now and said that
the girl who won had to forfeit her crown.</i>

245
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,000
<i>I don't know why. Something
about diet pills. But anyway...</i>

246
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:49,000
<i>Now she has a place in the state
contest in Redondo Beach!</i>

247
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,900
Oh, my gosh! I won! I won! I won! I won!

248
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,900
- Finish your dinner!
- I'm finished!

249
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,700
- What happened?
- I'm just calling to... Cindy!

250
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:04,100
Yeah, we just got it.
Yeah, she basically went crazy.

251
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
No, I didn't get that.
The machine cut you off.

252
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,000
Okay...

253
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,600
Redondo Beach. This Sunday?

254
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:18,800
- Are you guys going?
- Yes.

255
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:22,000
- Can you put it off?
- They have to. They have to.

256
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,800
- Where does that leave us?
- We can't do it. We can't.

257
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:27,600
No, no. No, I understand that, Cindy, yeah.

258
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,700
- They...
- I just...

259
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,200
No, I'll just figure it out. Okay, bye-bye.

260
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,300
It's this Sunday?
Why can't Jeff and Cindy take her?

261
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,100
They have some equestrian thing
in Santa Barbara.

262
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,200
You know, they do that horse shit
every single weekend.

263
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:43,000
Well, it's the nationals. They're taking
both horses, so apparently it's a big deal.

264
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,000
What about Olive?

265
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,500
Little Miss Sunshine!
Little Miss Sunshine! I won!

266
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,000
I won!

267
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,300
I'm going! We're going!

268
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,800
- You promised?!
- We'll fly out and come back Monday.

269
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,300
- How are you gonna get around out there?
- We'll rent a car.

270
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,600
- And stay at a hotel?
- We can afford it.

271
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:05,900
- Sheryl, this is our seed money.
- Well, if I had a little help bringin' it in.

272
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
- Don't start that.
- You know?

273
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,800
- It all goes to your nine steps!
- I told you!

274
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,700
I'm gonna talk to Stan Grossman.

275
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,100
We're gonna get locked
and loaded on this deal

276
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,500
and start generating some income!

277
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,900
- But in the meantime we've gotta be--
- Okay, okay! We'll drive!

278
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I'm not driving.

279
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,700
How are you gonna fit Grandpa in the Miata?

280
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,000
Well, Grandpa does not have to come.

281
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:25,600
 What?! I coached her!
I gave her the moves. I gotta go.

282
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,700
Why don't you take the VW?

283
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,600
I cannot drive a shift, Richard.
I tried and I cannot do it.

284
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,000
- We'll fly there.
- We can't afford it!

285
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:35,300
Well, that's what we're gonna do,
unless you have a better idea.

286
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,300
Here! This is dessert.

287
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:45,300
<i>I won!</i>

288
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,900
I won!

289
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,500
<i>Little Miss Sunshine!</i>

290
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,300
All right, I'll drive the bus.

291
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,200
Richard, I was told explicitly
not to leave Frank by himself.

292
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,000
- No offense, Frank.
- None taken.

293
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,800
What are you talking about? You got Dwayne
here. They can look after each other.

294
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,600
No, Richard! That's asking too much.

295
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:09,900
- If something happened...
- Okay, well, then...

296
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,500
We can't go, then, unless
Dwayne and Frank go with us.

297
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:17,700
- Right.
- <i>Mom, where's my bathing suit?</i>

298
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,800
Frank?

299
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,200
<i>I found it!</i>

300
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,300
Okay?

301
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,900
<i>I'm going!</i>

302
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,800
Oh, Dwayne, come on, please.
Think of your sister.

303
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,700
Come on, Dwayne. It'll be a lot of fun.

304
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,300
You can go to the beach and...

305
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,900
"This is unfair.

306
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:50,300
"All I ask is

307
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,000
"that you leave me alone."

308
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,800
Dwayne, flight school.

309
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I will give you permission for flight school.

310
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,100
<i>I won!</i>

311
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,800
<i>I'm gonna win this one too!</i>

312
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,100
"But I'm not going

313
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,400
"to have any fun."

314
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,900
Yeah, we're all with you on that one, Dwayne.

315
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,900
Grandpa! Grandpa!
Is Grandpa coming to California?

316
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,700
- We're all coming, honey.
- Hey, hold on.

317
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,800
Olive, come over here for a second.

318
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,000
Come here. Sit down for a second.

319
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,000
Look...

320
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:44,000
There's no sense in entering a contest,
if you don't think you're gonna win.

321
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:48,900
So, do you think you can win
Little Miss Sunshine?

322
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,500
Richard!

323
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,200
Are you gonna win?

324
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,900
Yes!

325
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:04,000
We're going to California.

326
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,400
Good night, Dwayne.

327
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,600
Not on your watch. I wouldn't do that to you.

328
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,000
Thank you, Dwayne.

329
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:49,500
Coming from you, that means a lot.

330
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,600
Good night.

331
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,800
Jesus, I'm tired. I'm so fucking tired.

332
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,800
Do you know how tired I am?

333
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:52,300
If some girl came up to me,
begged me to fuck her, I couldn't do it.

334
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,000
- Dad?
- That's how tired I am.

335
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,700
Watch the language, huh?

336
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,800
She's listening to music.

337
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:00,600
Olive, I'll give you a million dollars
if you turn around.

338
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,700
- See?
- All right.

339
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,900
- But the rest of us.
- Oh, the rest of you.

340
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,700
Can I give you some advice?

341
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:10,500
Well, I'm gonna give it to you anyway.

342
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,200
I don't want you making the same
mistakes I made when I was young.

343
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,000
Can't wait to hear this.

344
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,200
Dwayne... That's your name, right? Dwayne?

345
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,200
This is the voice of experience talking.

346
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,800
Are you listening?

347
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,400
Fuck a lot of women, Dwayne.

348
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,500
- Not just one woman. A lot of women.
- Hey, Dad!

349
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,900
- That's enough, all right?
- Are you getting any?

350
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
- You can tell me, Dwayne.
- Dad!

351
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:33,000
- Are you getting any?
- Come on, please.

352
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:36,000
No? Jesus! You're what, 15?

353
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,900
- My God, man!
- Dad!

354
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,400
- You should be getting that young stuff.
- Dad!

355
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,600
- The young stuff is the best in the world.
- Hey!

356
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:44,800
- Hey, Dad, that's enough! Stop it!
- Will you kindly not interrupt me, Richard!

357
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:48,200
See, right now you're jailbait.
They're jailbait. It's perfect.

358
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:51,600
I mean, you hit 18, man,
you're talking about 3 to 5.

359
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,900
Hey, I will pull this truck over right now!

360
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,700
So, pull the truck over! 
You're not gonna shut me off!

361
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,300
Fuck you! I can say what I want.

362
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,000
- I still got Nazi bullets in my ass!
- Ah, the Nazi bullets!

363
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:03,000
You're as bad as those fuckers
at Sunset Manor.

364
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:07,500
- What happened at Sunset Manor?
- Frank, don't encourage him.

365
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,000
What happended? I'll tell you what happened.

366
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,100
I paid my money. They took my money.

367
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,700
I should be able to do what the fuck I want!

368
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,700
- He started snorting heroin.
- You started snorting heroin?

369
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,900
- I'm old!
- Well, that stuff'll kill you.

370
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,900
What am I, an idiot?
And don't you start taking that shit.

371
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
When you're young,
you're crazy to do that stuff.

372
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:26,000
- What about you?
- What about me? I'm old!

373
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,800
When you get old, you're crazy not to do it.

374
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,300
We've tried. Believe me.

375
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,700
The intervention was a fiasco.
He's worse than a 2-year-old.

376
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,700
Can we please talk about something else?

377
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:37,900
- I take it you didn't like it at Sunset Manor.
- Frank.

378
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,200
Are you kidding me?
It was a fucking paradise.

379
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:42,300
They got a pool. They got golf.

380
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,800
Now I'm stuck with Mr. Happy here,
sleeping on a fuckin' sofa.

381
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:49,900
Look, I know you're a homo and all,
but maybe you can appreciate this.

382
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,400
You go to one of those places,
there's four women for every guy.

383
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:56,100
- Can you imagine what that's like?
- You must've been very busy.

384
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,500
I had second-degree burns
on my johnson. I kid you not.

385
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,600
- Really?
- Forget about it.

386
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,700
What are you guys talking about?

387
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
- Politics.
- Oh!

388
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:13,500
Fuck a lot of women, kid.
I have no reason to lie to you.

389
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,800
Not one woman. A lot of women.

390
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:21,700
You heard what I said?
Did it go in anywhere?

391
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,700
Yeah, I think we get the point, Dad.

392
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,600
Don't show me the pad.
I don't wanna see the fucking pad.

393
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,400
Mom, how much can we spend?

394
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:36,300
I would say $4. Anything under $4.

395
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,700
- Hi. You ready?
- Yeah.

396
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:42,500
- I'm gonna have the number 5
with coffee, please. - All right.

397
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,700
A number 7, over easy,
and a grapefruit juice.

398
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:50,600
- Grapefruit. Okay.
- I would like a fruit plate.

399
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,700
- And do you have chamomile?
- Yes.

400
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:56,400
- With honey, please.
- I would like the lumberjack and coffee.

401
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:59,500
- And extra bacon.
- Extra.

402
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,000
- Now, Dad, you should probably, maybe--
- Richard, don't start.

403
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,200
- He's gonna kill himself.
- Well, it's his life.

404
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,400
- Thank you, Sheryl.
- Garden salad?

405
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,200
And you.

406
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:11,700
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Take your time.

407
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,500
Don't apologize, Olive.
It's a sign of weakness.

408
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:18,200
Well, I want... Okay, okay.
I know what I want. I know.

409
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:22,600
Okay, can I get the waffles and...

410
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:25,300
I don't... What does "alamodey" mean?

411
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,700
- Oh, that means it comes with ice cream.
- Okay, "alamodey" then.

412
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:32,300
- Olive, for breakfast?
- You said $4.

413
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,300
Okay. You're right. Thank you.

414
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,000
Okay. Be right back.

415
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:40,200
Actually, Olive, "à la mode" in French

416
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:43,900
translates literally as "in the fashion".

417
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,200
À la mode.

418
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:50,200
"Mode" is derived from Latin "modus",
meaning "due or proper measure".

419
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:52,400
- Frank, shut up.
- Richard!

420
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:55,400
- Olive, can I tell you a little something
about ice cream? - Yeah.

421
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:58,200
Well, ice cream is made from cream,

422
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,200
which comes from cow's milk,

423
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:03,000
and cream has a lot of fat in it.

424
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,000
- Richard.
- What?

425
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:08,900
- She's gonna find out anyway, remember?
- What? Find out what?

426
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,900
Well, when you eat ice cream,

427
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,900
the fat in the ice cream
becomes fat in your body.

428
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
- Richard, I swear to God!
- It's true.

429
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,400
- What? What's wrong?
- Nothing, honey. Nothing's wrong.

430
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:22,900
So, if you eat a lot of ice cream,
you might become fat.

431
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,700
And if you don't, you're gonna
stay nice and skinny, sweetie.

432
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,500
- Mom?
- Olive, Richard is an idiot.

433
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,200
I like a woman with meat on her bones.

434
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:36,000
- Why's everyone so upset?
- No, no one's upset, honey.

435
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,900
I just want you to understand

436
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,900
it's okay to be skinny, and it's okay
to be fat, if that's what you wanna be.

437
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,500
Whatever you want, it's okay.

438
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,500
Okay, but, Olive, let me ask you this...

439
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,400
Those women in Miss America...

440
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:56,000
Are they skinny, or are they fat?

441
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,600
Honey?

442
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:03,600
Well... They're skinny, I guess.

443
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:06,400
Yeah. I guess they don't eat
a lot of ice cream.

444
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:10,900
Okay. Coffee. Coffee.

445
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,400
- Grapefruit.
- Thank you.

446
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,000
Chamomile.

447
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,600
And here's your ice cream.

448
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,000
"Alamodey", right?

449
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,200
I'll be back with your waffles in a second.

450
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,700
Does anyone want my ice cream?

451
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:31,200
Yeah, I'd like a little. Dwayne? Frank?

452
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:34,500
- Olive's not gonna have her ice cream.
- Yeah! Do you mind if I have a little?

453
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,900
- Yeah, let's dig in.
- That looks really good.

454
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,500
Boy, I feel sorry for anybody
that doesn't want to enjoy...

455
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,300
- ...their ice cream so early in the morning.
- Boy, that looks good.

456
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:45,100
You sure you don't wanna have some, Olive?

457
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,300
Those waffles are gonna be
awful lonely in there.

458
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Watch this.

459
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:53,300
Wait! Stop! Don't eat it all.

460
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:00,600
- All right, Olive--
- Richard!

461
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:07,100
Hey, Stan!

462
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:10,700
Stan, it's Richard. Again.
Listen, I know you're busy,

463
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:14,400
but we're just dying to hear what sort
of numbers you came up with in Scottsdale.

464
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,200
So, give me a call, please.

465
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,300
Hey, did you get him?

466
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:21,600
No, I can't get a signal out of this thing.

467
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:26,100
- How long till we get there?
- A long time, honey.

468
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,100
I know. But how long?

469
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:32,200
Well, we gotta do 600 miles of
driving today and 200 tomorrow.

470
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:35,000
- That's a lot of driving. Let's go.
- Well, honey, I'll drive for a while.

471
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,600
- No, no. I got it.
- No, you're right.

472
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:40,200
 I gotta learn how to do this. I mean,
you're doing it. How hard can it be?

473
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:46,200
- Push the stick down hard.
- I'm pushing hard.

474
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:48,700
Okay, okay, there you go.

475
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,400
Now push the clutch in
all the way to the floor.

476
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,000
It's on the floor!

477
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,800
The floor!

478
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:08,000
- Sticking on there.
- Push it down hard.

479
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:14,700
Well, you've got a problem.

480
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,900
Your clutch is shot.

481
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,300
Can we get a new one?

482
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:23,900
These old buses, you... have to order the part.

483
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,600
How long does it take?

484
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:28,500
Well, it's the weekend.

485
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:34,300
So... maybe... Thursday.

486
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:53,700
Is there a... dealership around here?

487
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:56,400
Well, they're probably gonna be closed.

488
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,600
It's the weekend, you know.

489
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:01,300
Yes, we're aware of that.

490
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:05,600
I'll tell you what. You know these old buses?

491
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:10,600
You don't need the clutch
to change from the 3rd to the 4th.

492
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:14,700
You only really need the clutch to go
from number 1 to number 2.

493
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:18,200
But as long as you keep parking on a hill,

494
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:22,400
and you let it go,
and it goes 15, 20 miles per hour,

495
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:25,300
you start her in 3rd,
and then you go from 3rd to 4th.

496
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:28,600
What if you're not on a hill? There's no hill.

497
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,800
What if there's no hill? What do you...?

498
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:33,200
Yeah, it's...

499
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:42,600
Olive, Dad, I want you in the car first.

500
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:45,400
- I know. We know.
- All right, here we go!

501
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:50,900
Everybody push! All right!

502
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,100
Here we go! Push! Push!

503
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,900
Okay. Okay. Okay!

504
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,500
I just want everyone here to know that
I am the preeminent Proust scholar...

505
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,000
- ...in the United States.
- Here we go!

506
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,900
- Come, on, honey.
- I'm putting it in gear!

507
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,300
- Go, honey!
- Come on!

508
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,600
Come on, Olive! Run! Run! Come on!

509
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,600
- Come on!
- Sheryl, let's go!

510
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,200
Sheryl!

511
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,000
Frank, let's go!

512
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,500
- I'm coming.
- You're losing them.

513
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,800
- Slow down!
- I can't slow down!

514
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:29,200
Come on! Come on!
Come on, you dumb bastard!

515
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:31,000
I can't. I can't slow down. I can't slow down!

516
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:34,000
- Let's go!
- Dwayne, help him. Come on!

517
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,400
Come on. Come on. Get in.

518
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:41,900
No one gets left behind!

519
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,200
- Close the door!
- No one gets left behind!

520
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:47,000
Outstanding, soldier! Outstanding!

521
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,700
Outstanding.

522
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:57,100
- Was that fun?
- Yeah.

523
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,100
So, finally I'm just sitting there,

524
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,100
and I decide, you know,
"This is Stan Grossman. What the hell?"

525
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,500
And I start pitching him the nine steps.

526
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:58,700
And about, I don't know, 2 minutes in,
he stops me, he says...

527
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,200
"I can sell this."

528
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:03,200
Mm-hmm. Interesting.

529
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:05,600
Yeah, and this is the guy
who knows how to do it, you know.

530
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:08,000
You start with a book,
and then you do a media tour,

531
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:10,700
corporate events, DVD, VHS series.

532
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,600
I mean, there's a whole fascinating science
into how you roll these things out.

533
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:15,700
- Wow!
- Yeah.

534
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,900
- So, he's in Scottsdale right now, you know...
- Uh-huh.

535
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,400
...building the buzz and kind of
getting the whole hype thing going.

536
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:25,000
He's doing what the pros call
"a ticking clock auction".

537
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:28,200
Oh, how about that!

538
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:35,600
Yeah, and I can detect
that note of sarcasm there, Frank.

539
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:38,500
What sarcasm? I didn't... hear it.

540
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,600
But I want you to know something.

541
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,600
I feel sorry for you.

542
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:45,500
- You do? Good.
- Yeah, I do.

543
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:48,000
Because sarcasm is the refuge of losers.

544
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:50,500
- It is? Really?
- Yep.

545
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:54,000
Sarcasm is losers trying to bring
winners down to their level.

546
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:55,300
And that's step four in the program.

547
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:58,000
Wow, Richard, you've really opened
my eyes to what a loser I am.

548
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,900
How much do I owe you
for those pearls of wisdom?

549
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,200
- Oh, that one's on the house, buddy.
- It is?

550
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,400
- Yeah, it's on the house. That's on the house!
- Okay, you guys, that's enough.

551
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,900
- Wow! That was for free?
- No charge. - Frank, stop it.

552
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
- You're not gonna charge me for that?
- No charge. - Frank, stop it.

553
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:09,500
- Stop it! - Laugh it up!
- He started it.

554
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,900
Oh, wait a second.

555
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
- Hey, hey, quiet. This is it.
- You are so bad!

556
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:13,300
This is that call.

557
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:17,000
Hello?

558
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,200
Stan?

559
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,500
Stan?

560
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,400
Stan Grossman? Richard Hoover.

561
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:35,400
Finally! How're you doing?

562
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:38,700
No, I know. We were on the highway,
and I lost you on my cell.

563
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,000
Forget about it. How'd we do?

564
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,600
Honey, I'm gonna use the ladies' room.
You need to go?

565
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:53,000
No. I'm gonna go practice
my routine over there.

566
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,600
Okay, well, don't go too far.

567
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:58,700
Well, I think that we just
gotta talk to him a little...

568
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:00,800
No, you gotta talk to...

569
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,900
No, Stan, listen to me. Hold on now.

570
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,500
I am going to get something to drink.
You want anything?

571
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,600
- Yeah, get me some porn.
- Okay.

572
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:15,000
Get me something really nasty too.
I don't want any of that airbrushed shit.

573
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,800
- Okay.
- Okay, here's a 20.

574
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:20,000
Get yourself a little treat too.
Get yourself a fag rag.

575
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,200
All right! I will!

576
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:27,900
That one. Yes. And that one.

577
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:31,400
And... I would like that one. No, down.

578
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:34,900
Yes. Yes. Yes. I would like that one.

579
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,900
And... I will have a...

580
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,700
a blue raspberry Slushee.

581
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,700
Frank?

582
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,700
Oh, my God! How are you?

583
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,100
I thought you were gonna be
in Santa Fe for the conference.

584
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,500
I was looking for you.

585
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,600
- Aren't you supposed to be in New Haven?
- Yeah.

586
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:56,600
- Well, I mean, you heard about Larry
and the whole genius thing, right? - Yeah.

587
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:59,100
- It's official.
- Oh, good.

588
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,300
So, we're going to this private spa
in Sedona for the week and then...

589
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,200
- Larry's here?
- Yeah.

590
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:08,400
- He's out filling the tank.
- Oh! Yeah, there he is.

591
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:12,000
Wow! I can't believe this.
How have you been?

592
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:14,000
I've been fine.

593
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:17,000
Good. Good.

594
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:21,000
You know, I heard that you got fired.

595
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:24,400
Yeah. No, I quit, 'cause
enough is enough, you know?

596
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,800
Right. Good. Good.

597
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:29,700
So, what are you up to now?

598
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:33,000
I'm weighing my options and...

599
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,300
just, you know, taking some time off...

600
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,500
Great. That's great.

601
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:43,000
$19.79, sir.

602
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,000
So...

603
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:54,400
- Well, it was great to see you.
- Yeah, you too.

604
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,900
- Take care of yourself.
- You too.

605
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:58,300
Bye.

606
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:30,700
Hey, you forgot your Slushee.

607
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,700
You're in Scottsdale right now, right?

608
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,800
Okay, I can come by.

609
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
I'm gonna be coming through there.
I could swing right by. We could...

610
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,100
Christ! He's not getting it.

611
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,200
<i>Did you try that?</i>

612
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,000
<i>Listen to what I'm saying, Stan!</i>

613
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,800
So, what happened?

614
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,200
Nothing. Let's get out of here.

615
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:07,000
Wait a minute. I thought
you said this was a done deal.

616
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,100
He said it was a done deal.

617
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,100
What, you didn't get anything?

618
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,800
Oh, my God! Where does that leave us?

619
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:13,400
Fucked. That's where it leaves us.

620
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:14,700
I can't believe I'm hearing this!

621
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,400
- Did you even try negotiating?
- Yes, I tried!

622
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:19,000
Of course I tried! What do you think I...?

623
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,500
Let's just go, okay?
Let's go. Let's go. Come on.

624
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,600
Let's go!

625
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,400
"Where's Olive?"

626
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,400
- All right, Frank.
- Come on, Olive.

627
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,400
- Come on, Olive. - Come on, honey.
- Come on, sweetie, jump.

628
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,600
- Jump in the car. We can't stop. Jump.
- Be careful!

629
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:32,300
- I got her! I got her!
- Yes!

630
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:55,000
Richard...

631
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,200
Yeah.

632
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:02,600
Whatever happens, you tried
to do something on your own,

633
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:05,100
which is more than most people ever do.

634
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,100
And I include myself in that category.

635
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:14,000
You took a big chance.
That took guts, and I'm proud of you.

636
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:19,200
Okay, Dad. Thank you.

637
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,600
Thank you, Dad.

638
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:07,900
Okay, here is 11.

639
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:10,100
Frank, you're 12.

640
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,400
And Grandpa's 13.

641
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:16,400
Can I sleep with Grandpa tonight?

642
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,400
Well, you'll have to ask Grandpa.

643
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,800
- Grandpa?
- I got two beds.

644
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,800
You could still use some rehearsing.

645
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,200
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

646
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:34,600
All right, everybody,
we have a long day tomorrow.

647
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:37,600
So, I'll knock on your doors at 7:00 a.m.

648
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:40,100
That means no lollygagging.

649
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:43,100
We need to be packed
and on the road by 7:40, guys.

650
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,000
- Frank, you guys'll be okay?
- Yeah, we're fine.

651
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:46,200
Okay, well, good night.

652
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:48,000
- Good night.
- Sleep tight.

653
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:50,500
Okay.

654
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,300
What a fucking nightmare!

655
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,700
Richard, we have to talk.

656
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,700
Please...

657
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:21,300
Sheryl, let's just get through this and go home.

658
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,400
<i>No, Richard, we have to talk now!</i>

659
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:25,600
<i>Well, I tried to tell you
we couldn't afford this trip!</i>

660
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:29,000
<i>- Do you realize we're becoming bankrupt?
- We are not bankrupt!</i>

661
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:33,300
Hey, don't listen to that.

662
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,400
Let's turn on the tube.

663
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:37,200
<i>...we enthusiastically agree that the right man...</i>

664
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:39,500
- I'm gonna brush my teeth.
- <i>...to preserve the traditions.</i>

665
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:45,000
<i>Secretary Rumsfeld and I thought
long and hard about this important choice.</i>

666
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:48,000
<i>- To me...
- You said this was a lock, Richard!</i>

667
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:51,600
<i>- You said it was a done deal!
- Stan Grossman said it was a done deal!</i>

668
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:54,600
<i>- I'm not married to Stan Grossman!
- I trusted him, all right?!</i>

669
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:57,600
<i> You gotta trust in order to be trusted!
That's step six!</i>

670
00:43:57,700 --> 00:44:00,000
<i>Oh, fuck the nine steps, Richard!</i>

671
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:02,700
<i>They're not working! Forget it! It's over!</i>

672
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:06,000
<i>I never wanna hear about the nine steps again!</i>

673
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:18,000
Perfect. Perfect.
You're the world champion growler.

674
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:20,700
Time for your beauty rest. Get in there.

675
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,100
There you go.

676
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,000
Good night.

677
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,000
- Grandpa?
- Yeah.

678
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:39,500
- I'm kinda scared about tomorrow.
- Are you kidding me?

679
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:43,000
You're gonna blow 'em out of the water.
They're not gonna know what hit 'em.

680
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:46,700
- Grandpa?
- Yeah.

681
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:51,000
- Am I pretty?
- Olive...

682
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:57,000
You are the most beautiful girl
in the whole world.

683
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:59,500
Nah, you're just saying that.

684
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,400
No, I'm not. I'm madly in love with you.

685
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:04,200
And it's not because of your brains
or your personality.

686
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:07,900
It's because you're beautiful, inside and out.

687
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,700
- Grandpa?
- What?

688
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:18,400
- I don't wanna be a loser.
- You're not a loser.

689
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:21,200
Where'd you get the idea you're a loser?

690
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:24,800
Because Daddy hates losers.

691
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:27,200
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Back up a minute.

692
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:29,200
You know what a loser is?

693
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:35,000
A real loser is somebody that's so afraid
of not winning, they don't even try.

694
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:39,000
- Now, you're trying, right?
- Yeah.

695
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:43,100
Well, then, you're not a loser.
We're gonna have fun tomorrow, right?

696
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,700
Yeah.

697
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:49,600
We can tell 'em all to go to hell.

698
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:52,300
Good night, sweetie. I love you.

699
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:16,200
What are you doing?

700
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,200
I'm gonna fix this.

701
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:23,600
Richard?

702
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,900
I'm gonna fix this.

703
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:58,500
Here we go. Here we go.

704
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:25,200
Hi.

705
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:43,300
Hi. Stan Grossman, please.

706
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:51,100
Stan, it's Richard.
I don't know where the fuck you are.

707
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,700
I'm at the hotel. Call me.

708
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,700
<i>So, he's standing there and he says to me...</i>

709
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:12,700
<i>"The book is really a memoirs
from my life experience."</i>

710
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
It's like he's 20.

711
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:20,400
So I said, "You want me to teach you
about life experiences, you sit down.

712
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:23,200
"You can write a book about my experiences."

713
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:26,000
So, he says to me...

714
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:30,100
Hello, Stan.

715
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:33,900
- You're the one that said it would sell!
- That's what I thought at the time.

716
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,700
But it's a great program. You said so
yourself. I mean, I don't understand.

717
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:42,000
It's not the program, Richard. It's you. Okay?

718
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:46,800
No one's heard of you. Nobody cares.

719
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,800
What's the next step?

720
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:58,900
There is none. We had our shot.

721
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,700
It didn't fly. We move on.

722
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:04,900
- You mean give up?
- Richard.

723
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:09,200
Hey, whoa, hey! One setback here,
and you're ready to just quit?

724
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:12,500
Richard, listen. I pushed this thing hard, okay?

725
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:16,200
I rammed it down their fucking throats,
and no one bought it!

726
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:19,000
It's time to move on.

727
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:21,300
You're not gonna win this one.

728
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:25,800
Okay. Okay. You know what?

729
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:28,900
Good. I'm glad. You know why?

730
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,700
Because this is what
the nine steps are all about.

731
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:33,800
- Right here, Stan. Right here!
- Richard...

732
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:35,300
- Richard, please.
- Yeah, no. You blew it!

733
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:37,800
You blew it. You're out!

734
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:50,900
Mom? Dad?

735
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:57,600
What is it, hon?

736
00:50:57,700 --> 00:51:00,000
Grandpa won't wake up.

737
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:17,500
Wanna take an eye test?

738
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:21,000
Uncle Frank, an eye test?

739
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:25,200
Olive, come here. Put those away.

740
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:27,000
We're gonna have a family meeting.

741
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:28,800
Dwayne, family meeting.

742
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:35,000
First of all,

743
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:39,400
the doctors are doing everything
they can to help Grandpa right now.

744
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:43,600
He's had a long, eventful life,

745
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:46,800
and I know he loves both of you very much.

746
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:51,600
But if God wants to take him,
we have to be ready to accept that, okay?

747
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:57,800
Whatever happens, we're a family.

748
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:02,400
And what's important
is that we love each other.

749
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:06,200
I love you guys so, so much.

750
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:37,400
Are you the family of Edwin Hoover?

751
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:39,400
Yes.

752
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:45,600
I'm sorry. We did everything we could.

753
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:48,500
He was...

754
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:51,000
Well, it was too much.

755
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:54,700
He probably just fell asleep
and never woke up.

756
00:52:56,700 --> 00:53:00,500
I'll have someone come talk to you
about handling the remains.

757
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,900
Thank you.

758
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:17,200
Linda!

759
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:25,900
Mom?

760
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,900
Is Grandpa dead?

761
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,200
Yeah, honey. He passed away.

762
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,500
Hi.

763
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,800
I'm your bereavement liaison, Linda.

764
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:02,000
- My consolations for your loss.
- Thank you.

765
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:05,400
Okay, these are the forms you need to fill out.

766
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:08,200
A death certificate.

767
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:11,400
A report of death.
An M.E. pink slip.

768
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:14,400
- Please try and be as detailed as possible.
- Okay.

769
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:19,500
This is a brochure for a grief recovery
support group that meets on Tuesdays.

770
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:22,800
And, if you like, at this time,
I can refer you to a funeral home,

771
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:24,900
so you can begin making
your own arrangements.

772
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,900
Actually, pre-arrangements have
already been made in Albuquerque.

773
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:31,900
Albuquerque?

774
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,900
We're actually on our way
to California right now.

775
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,200
If the body is crossing state lines,

776
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:38,500
you're gonna need a burial transit permit
from the county registrar's office.

777
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:42,100
Okay, but we're trying to get
to Redondo Beach by 3 o'clock.

778
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:44,000
3 o'clock today?!

779
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,300
Ain't gonna happen.

780
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:50,600
Okay, can I just...

781
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:54,300
I know that this is...
this might be a little unusual,

782
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:56,900
but if maybe we could just go,

783
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
and then we'll come back,

784
00:54:58,100 --> 00:55:00,400
and we'll take care of all the paperwork,
and, you know...

785
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:02,400
No. You can't just abandon the body.

786
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:05,200
No, no, no. Nobody's gonna
abandon the body.

787
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:07,900
- We're just gonna go and come... back.
- Otherwise, the hospital becomes responsible.

788
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
- We're gonna go and come back.
- Sir...

789
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:10,900
- ...there are ways we have of doing things.
- You are not following me.

790
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,000
- Sir!
- I don't think you're listening.

791
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:13,100
- We're gonna go and come back.
- You are not the only one that's had...

792
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:15,200
...somebody die here today, okay?

793
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:26,100
Is there any way we might
be able to view the remains?

794
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:35,000
We haven't had a chance
to move him downstairs,

795
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:39,300
so someone may come in in a few minutes
to take him to the basement.

796
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:42,300
Just tell them who you are, and they will wait.

797
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:44,200
- Thank you.
- Okay?

798
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:48,200
And when you're done with the paperwork,
I'll be at the nurses' station.

799
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:50,900
- Great. Thank you, Linda.
- Thank you.

800
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:32,500
Goddamn it, Dad! Goddamn it!

801
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:36,300
Stupid.

802
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:48,700
We'll go to Little Miss Sunshine
next year, okay, honey?

803
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:50,800
Next year.

804
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:03,900
No. No. We've come 700 miles.

805
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,400
I will be damned if I'm not
making that contest, Sheryl.

806
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:10,100
Well, Richard, we can't leave him here.

807
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:15,000
We're not gonna leave him.

808
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:20,300
- Richard, what are you doing?
- Fuck!

809
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:28,500
- Dwayne, go around outside.
- Richard, what are you thinking?

810
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:30,900
- We're gonna take him with us.
- No, no. That is not happening.

811
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,600
- That is not happening.
- He's better off with us that these people.

812
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:35,800
I want you to go around outside
underneath this window.

813
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:37,500
- Frank you go with him.
- No, no. Dwayne, don't you dare move.

814
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:40,300
No, honey, look, you stay here.
We'll take Olive. Frank can drive.

815
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:43,000
No, Sheryl, we'll be there in two hours.

816
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:45,800
Listen to me!
I'll call a funeral home once we get there.

817
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
If there's one thing my father
would have wanted,

818
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:51,300
it's to see Olive perform
in the Little Miss Sunshine Pageant.

819
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:55,300
Now, I believe we'd be doing
a grave disservice to his memory,

820
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:58,000
if we were to just give up now. All right?

821
00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:00,800
There's two kinds of people in this world.

822
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:04,400
There's winners and there's losers.
Okay? You know what the difference is?

823
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:06,500
Winners don't give up.

824
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:10,200
So, what are we here?
Are we winners, or are we losers?

825
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:12,000
Huh?

826
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:15,300
Okay, okay, okay. Let's do it.

827
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:18,400
You guys go. Olive, you watch the curtain.

828
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:27,700
I don't know. I have no reason
to assume it's gonna be otherwise.

829
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:29,900
Watch. Get the back. Get the back.

830
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,500
Shh. Go, go, go.

831
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:36,000
Yeah, 1 o'clock.

832
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:40,000
Now?

833
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:43,400
He's very heavy. Be gentle.

834
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:47,000
One, two...

835
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,200
Okay, three.

836
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:52,700
Wait, wait, wait! Not yet. Not yet.

837
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:54,600
Okay, go. Go, go, go.

838
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:56,000
- Go.
- Shh, shh, shh.

839
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:57,500
Okay, okay.

840
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:59,800
Richard, I can't do it!<

841
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:01,800
Come on.

842
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:04,100
Dad! Come on! Hurry up!

843
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:11,500
Okay, he's slipping. Okay.

844
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,700
I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it.

845
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:23,000
Be careful.

846
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:28,000
Be cool. Be cool.

847
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:30,000
Hurry up!

848
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:33,200
Keep watch, Olive.

849
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:36,000
Watch the curb. Watch the curb.

850
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:45,000
Watch his head! Watch it!

851
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:47,900
Keys.

852
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,500
Swing him around this way.

853
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
- Olive, get in.
- Here we go.

854
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:58,700
Okay, let's go.

855
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:05,000
All right. Let's go, Frank.

856
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:08,700
Did I mention that I am the preeminent
Proust scholar in the U.S.?

857
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:12,700
Here we go! Here we go!

858
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:15,000
Are you okay?

859
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,500
- Dad?
- Yeah, honey?

860
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:31,300
What's gonna happen to Grandpa?

861
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:55,000
Uncle Frank?

862
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:57,000
Yeah?

863
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:01,300
Do you think there's a heaven?

864
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:08,000
That's hard to say, Olive.
I don't think anyone knows for sure.

865
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:12,000
I know, but what do you think?

866
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,900
- Well...
- I think there is one.

867
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:22,600
- You think I'll get in?
- Yes.

868
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:24,800
- You promise?
- Yes.

869
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:41,200
Whoa! Hey! Son of a bitch!

870
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:44,100
- What happened?
- He cut me off.

871
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:50,500
Okay, just leave it.

872
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:53,000
It's stuck or something.

873
01:01:53,100 --> 01:01:56,500
- Maybe, try pulling it from under here.
- No, no. Just leave it.

874
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:01,000
- Fix it when we get there.
- Okay, fine.

875
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:09,900
Oh, Jesus! God!

876
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,000
I'm being pulled over. Here we go.

877
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:18,600
Okay. Everybody just
pretend to be normal, okay?

878
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:21,600
Like everything's normal here.

879
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:36,900
How you folks doin'?

880
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:40,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we're fine. Just...

881
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:42,200
- Little trouble with the horn?
- Sorry.

882
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:44,500
- What?
- Havin' a little trouble with your horn?

883
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:46,500
Yeah.

884
01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:51,200
Little trouble. Sorry. Sorry.

885
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:54,300
Could you step outside the vehicle?

886
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:05,700
- Step this way, please.
- No, no.

887
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:08,400
- What?
- Don't...

888
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:10,700
"Don't" what?

889
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:16,200
- Do you have something in your trunk, sir?
- It's nothing...

890
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:17,300
Don't open it.

891
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:20,300
Sir, do you realize you've just given me
probable cause to search your trunk?

892
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:22,500
- Just...
- Put your hands on the vehicle now!

893
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:23,700
- I just want--
- Now!

894
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:26,600
- Don't move.
- Okay.

895
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:31,000
It's not illegal!

896
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:33,500
Sir, I would advise you
to keep your mouth shut!

897
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:38,300
Oh, my God! What is he doing?

898
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,900
- It's not illegal.
- Goddamn!

899
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,300
Sir, could you come back here?

900
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:07,000
I love this stuff. I love it.

901
01:04:07,100 --> 01:04:09,200
God bless ya. God bless ya.

902
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:11,600
Don't worry, I'm not gonna bust ya.

903
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:14,000
Oh, thank you.

904
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:16,900
How you doin'?

905
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:22,500
- Cute family. That's nice.
- Thank you.

906
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:25,800
This on the side. A little of this, a little of that.

907
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:28,100
- Oh, man!
- Sweetness.

908
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:30,400
That is sweet, yeah.

909
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:33,900
- Dirty.
- And this one is one of my favorites.

910
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,100
Good, yeah.

911
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:40,200
That's a little different choice.

912
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:45,000
No?

913
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,200
- Gonna leave that with ya.
- All right.

914
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:52,100
- You have a good day there.
- Yeah.

915
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:05,500
What happened?

916
01:05:06,100 --> 01:05:09,600
I'll tell you when I regain consciousness.

917
01:05:11,900 --> 01:05:15,300
Frank, Dwayne, get out and push.

918
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:35,900
Okay, there it is... Redondo Beach, 46.

919
01:05:36,100 --> 01:05:38,000
It's 2:15. Might be a few minutes late.

920
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:40,900
Now, Richard, they said 3 o'clock sharp.
They were very explicit.

921
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,900
We can't cross these people. Trust me.

922
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:46,300
- Mom, Dwayne has 20/20 vision.
- I bet he does.

923
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:49,800
Okay, now I'm gonna check
to see if you're color blind.

924
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:52,000
- <i>Asshole!</i>
- (I'm not doing this.)

925
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:56,100
- (I'm not doing this.)
- What's the letter in the circle?

926
01:05:58,300 --> 01:06:01,200
No, no, no. Inside the circle.

927
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:03,600
Right there. See?

928
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:07,500
It's an "A". Can't you see it? Right there.

929
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:12,700
It's bright green.

930
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:17,300
Oh, man!

931
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:29,100
Dwayne, I think you might be color blind.

932
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:42,000
You can't fly jets if you're color blind.

933
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:56,800
We've got a little bit of...

934
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,500
Okay, we got an emergency back here.

935
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:00,900
- I think we just need to pull over, man.
- What is it?

936
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,000
- Just, pull over!
- What's the emergency?

937
01:07:02,100 --> 01:07:04,100
Dwayne, wait. It's all right, man.

938
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:06,800
- Dwayne, Dwayne! It's all right. Hold on.
- The only emergency is that--

939
01:07:06,900 --> 01:07:09,400
- Just pull over the car! We're not kidding!
- Okay, okay! All right, all right!

940
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,700
Could you get him to pull over, please?

941
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:13,900
- Richard, pull over!
- Richard, pull over the car!

942
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,400
- It's all right, honey. We're pulling over.
- I'm pulling over.

943
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:17,900
- Calm down. It's all right.
- Stop it. Stop it.

944
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,900
Dwayne! No! No, no. Dwayne, Dawyne.
Sit down. Sit down!

945
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,000
God, this better be good!

946
01:07:22,100 --> 01:07:23,200
- Pull over.
- I'm pulling over.

947
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:24,800
- Let him down.
- All right, all right.

948
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:25,900
- Stop the car.
- Okay, okay.

949
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,300
- It's gonna be okay, Dwayne.
- Do not open the door.

950
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:30,400
Dwayne? Oh, God!

951
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:36,500
Fuck!

952
01:07:41,100 --> 01:07:44,500
- What happened?
- He's color blind. He can't fly.

953
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:47,000
Oh, Jesus! Oh, no!

954
01:07:52,100 --> 01:07:54,200
Just give him a second.

955
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:18,500
Dwayne?

956
01:08:22,100 --> 01:08:24,300
Dwayne, honey, I'm sorry.

957
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:34,500
- Dwayne, come on. We have to go.
- I'm not going.

958
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:40,200
- Dwayne...
- I said I'm not.

959
01:08:40,300 --> 01:08:44,300
Okay? I don't care.
I'm not getting on that bus again.

960
01:08:44,700 --> 01:08:46,700
Dwayne, for better or worse,
we're your family.

961
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:50,800
No, you're not my family!
Okay? I don't wanna be your family!

962
01:08:50,900 --> 01:08:55,100
I hate you fucking people! I hate you!

963
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:58,500
Divorce, bankrupt, suicide!

964
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:02,100
You fucking losers! You're losers!

965
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:08,100
No. Please just leave me here, Mom.

966
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:11,100
Okay? Please, please, please.

967
01:09:13,700 --> 01:09:15,900
Please just leave me here.

968
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,500
Shit!

969
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
I don't know what to do.

970
01:09:34,300 --> 01:09:37,100
Well, it's getting late.

971
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:40,100
Maybe, can somebody stay here with him?

972
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:43,200
- I'll stay.
- Oh, that is not happening.

973
01:09:46,300 --> 01:09:48,400
All right. Well...

974
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:53,600
I'm just worried about the time.

975
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:59,200
Olive, you...

976
01:09:59,300 --> 01:10:01,500
You wanna try talking to him?

977
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:04,800
Richard, no! There is nothing to say.
We just have to wait.

978
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:06,500
Honey...

979
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:58,500
Okay.

980
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:02,300
Let's go.

981
01:11:33,200 --> 01:11:36,200
I apologize for the things I said.

982
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:40,800
I was upset. I didn't really mean them.

983
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:46,200
- It's okay. Come on.
- Let's go.

984
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:55,200
2:55. All right, everybody,
look for the exit, okay?

985
01:11:58,900 --> 01:12:01,500
Here! Here's the turnoff. Turn in here.

986
01:12:01,700 --> 01:12:04,900
- Does anybody see the Redondo Suites?
- There! There's the hotel!

987
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,300
- There it is! There it is, Olive.
- Little Miss Sunshine! Little Miss Sunshine!

988
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:09,100
We're gonna make it.
We're gonna make it.

989
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:12,000
All right. How...

990
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,200
How the hell do you get over there?

991
01:12:15,300 --> 01:12:17,900
- Sheryl?
- No, no, no!

992
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:22,100
- No, no! You're passing it!
- Richard, turn around, turn around.

993
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:24,700
- You drove past it!
- You've gotta turn around!

994
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:25,900
What are you doing? It's back there!

995
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,300
- I can't turn around.
- Come on, Dad!

996
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:30,200
Does anybody see a way back?
It's a one-way street!

997
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:34,000
Rich, Rich! You've got parking lots on the right!

998
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:36,500
- Here, here, here!
- Put your seat belt on, baby!

999
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:39,200
- What are you doing?
- I can't slow down! I can't!

1000
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:40,300
Shit!

1001
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:41,400
What time is it, Frank?

1002
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:43,700
- Oh, 2:59.
- Dad!

1003
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:46,200
It's a straight shot from here.
We're gonna make it.

1004
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:49,100
- Oh, it's a dead end!
- I'm not going back!

1005
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:51,900
- Richard, you have to go back!
- That is a one-way road!

1006
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,900
That'll take us all the way
back to the freeway!

1007
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:58,500
You're the one who told me
to go left back there!

1008
01:12:58,900 --> 01:13:01,200
I'm not turning back!

1009
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:03,000
Richard!

1010
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:08,900
What are you doing? You can't do this!

1011
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,000
God, Richard!

1012
01:13:10,100 --> 01:13:12,000
Okay, here's the hotel.

1013
01:13:12,100 --> 01:13:13,900
Okay, stop!

1014
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,100
- Where's the entrance?
- Right here, right here!

1015
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:18,100
You're passing it! You're passing it!

1016
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:20,200
Hold on!

1017
01:13:21,900 --> 01:13:24,000
Here we go. One more time. Little bump.

1018
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:32,100
Mom!

1019
01:14:12,500 --> 01:14:16,900
- Hello? Hi, we'd like to register.
- Sorry, we're closed.

1020
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:18,900
No. We have the entrant right here.

1021
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:22,500
- We just wanna check in.
- Registration ended at 3:00.

1022
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:25,400
- It's 3 o'clock now.
- No.

1023
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:27,900
Oh, come on. Have a heart.
We're 4 minutes late.

1024
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,500
We just drove all the way from Albuquerque.

1025
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:32,000
- Then you should've been here by 3:00.
- Wait, wait, wait.

1026
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:34,200
There must be some way
we can work this out. Please.

1027
01:14:34,300 --> 01:14:38,400
Everybody else was here before 3:00.
I'd be giving unfair advantage.

1028
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:41,500
No, no. We're not looking for an advantage.
We just want her to compete. That's it!

1029
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:44,100
Don't yell at me, sir. I didn't make you late.

1030
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:47,500
We've settled on the schedule for the show.
We've turned off the computers.

1031
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:50,800
Our line-up is final.
And I have a hair check to do.

1032
01:14:50,900 --> 01:14:54,100
I'm sorry that you're late, but I can't help you.

1033
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,500
Please.

1034
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:02,000
You don't know what we've been through.

1035
01:15:05,700 --> 01:15:10,100
Miss Jenkins? I can put them in the system.

1036
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:14,500
- Oh, Kirby, you don't have to.
- No, it's okay. It's 5 minutes.

1037
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:18,100
Well, it's your time. Excuse me.

1038
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:20,500
Thank you, Kirby. Thank you very much.

1039
01:15:20,700 --> 01:15:22,200
Really, you don't know what this means.

1040
01:15:22,300 --> 01:15:24,000
Please, it's only 5 minutes.

1041
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,900
I am not working for these people
next year. These people are crazy.

1042
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:31,800
Okay. So, what's your name?

1043
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,400
- Olive.
- That's a nice name.

1044
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:37,900
Mom, Mom! Look! It's Miss California!

1045
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,700
- Look, it's really her!
- You wanna go say hi?

1046
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:47,800
Thank you.

1047
01:15:47,900 --> 01:15:51,100
- Hi! What's your name?
- Olive.

1048
01:15:51,200 --> 01:15:54,700
- What's your talent, Olive?
- I like dancing.

1049
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:57,400
Dancing was too hard for me. I'm a singer.

1050
01:15:57,500 --> 01:15:59,700
You must be a good dancer.

1051
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:01,800
I am. I'm really good.

1052
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,900
I bet you are.

1053
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:07,300
Well, thanks for stopping by, Olive.
Best of luck.

1054
01:16:10,300 --> 01:16:12,300
Miss California?

1055
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:15,800
- Do you eat ice cream?
- I love ice cream.

1056
01:16:15,900 --> 01:16:19,200
My favorite flavor is
Chocolate Cherry Garcia,

1057
01:16:19,300 --> 01:16:22,000
although, technically,
I think that's a frozen yogurt.

1058
01:16:22,700 --> 01:16:26,000
- Okay?
- Okay. Thanks.

1059
01:16:26,100 --> 01:16:29,000
- Bye.
- Bye.

1060
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:33,100
- Mom, she eats ice cream.
- I heard.

1061
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:38,300
Your packet has tickets in it
and... your badge number.

1062
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:40,400
- Okay.
- Is there anything else?

1063
01:16:40,700 --> 01:16:43,100
Yeah. Is there a funeral home around here?

1064
01:16:57,800 --> 01:16:59,200
- Hi.
- Hi.

1065
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,100
Okay, Olive, let's get your swimsuit on.

1066
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:07,300
You wanna go change behind the curtain?

1067
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:10,800
This is the last touch-up, everybody.
Final touch-ups. Last touch-up.

1068
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:45,800
- Okay, wait!
- I won't wait for you!

1069
01:17:46,900 --> 01:17:49,000
Let's get outta here.

1070
01:17:53,300 --> 01:17:55,900
Hey! Hey, Olive Hoover.

1071
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,700
Hey, I need your music.

1072
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:01,400
- Music, right. Music.
- Yeah.

1073
01:18:08,900 --> 01:18:10,800
Here you go.

1074
01:18:10,900 --> 01:18:14,300
- This? Did you choose this?
- No, my grandpa did.

1075
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:16,400
- Your grandpa?
- Mm-hm.

1076
01:18:16,500 --> 01:18:18,500
- Which track?
- 12.

1077
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:23,300
We were driving 5-6 hours.
Thought he was napping.

1078
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:26,000
By the time we figured it out, it's...

1079
01:18:27,100 --> 01:18:29,200
- You know.
- Too late.

1080
01:18:30,900 --> 01:18:33,400
So, where's the body?

1081
01:18:50,700 --> 01:18:52,600
Personal effects.

1082
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:54,700
- Thank you.
- You take care.

1083
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:58,400
You too.

1084
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:39,100
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the 24th annual...

01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:25,200
At the end of the evening, one of these girls

1115
01:21:25,300 --> 01:21:28,800
will be crowned Little Miss Sunshine!

1116
01:21:37,400 --> 01:21:40,000
Olive, honey, are you okay in there?

1117
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:42,200
Yeah, I'm fine.

1118
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,700
Hey.

1119
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,800
What?

1120
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:53,000
You got a kid in the show?

1121
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:55,100
Your first time?

1122
01:21:55,300 --> 01:21:57,200
Yeah, yeah.

1123
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:03,000
# For amber waves of grain #

1124
01:22:03,500 --> 01:22:09,800
# For purple mountain majesties #

1125
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:17,000
# Above the fruited plain #

1126
01:22:17,500 --> 01:22:24,000
# America! America! #

1127
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:30,000
# God shed His grace on thee #

1128
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:38,000
# And crown thy good with brotherhood #

1129
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:45,500
# From sea to shining sea #

1130
01:22:45,700 --> 01:22:48,300
<i>America!</i>

1131
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:50,700
<i>It's so beautiful!</i>

1132
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:57,600
Sometimes I just wish
I could go to sleep till I was 18,

1133
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:02,700
and skip all this crap, high school
and everything. Just skip it.

1134
01:23:05,300 --> 01:23:07,700
You know Marcel Proust?

1135
01:23:07,900 --> 01:23:10,400
- He's the guy you teach.
- Yeah.

1136
01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:13,900
French writer. Total loser.

1137
01:23:14,100 --> 01:23:16,000
Never had a real job.

1138
01:23:16,100 --> 01:23:19,400
Unrequited love affairs. Gay.

1139
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:22,400
Spent 20 years writing a book
almost no one reads.

1140
01:23:22,500 --> 01:23:24,800
But he's also probably
the greatest writer since Shakespeare.

1141
01:23:24,900 --> 01:23:29,300
Anyway, he... gets down to the end of his life

1142
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:32,400
and he looks back and decides
that all those years he suffered,

1143
01:23:32,500 --> 01:23:36,700
those were the best years of his life,
'cause they made him who he was.

1144
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:40,700
All the years he was happy? You know,
total waste. Didn't learn a thing.

1145
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:45,000
So, if you sleep until you're 18...

1146
01:23:45,100 --> 01:23:48,600
Ah, think of the suffering you're gonna miss!

1147
01:23:48,700 --> 01:23:52,400
I mean, high school? High school,
those are your prime suffering years.

1148
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:54,900
You don't get better suffering than that.

1149
01:23:58,900 --> 01:24:00,900
You know what?

1150
01:24:02,700 --> 01:24:04,600
Fuck beauty contests.

1151
01:24:05,900 --> 01:24:09,200
Life is one fucking
beauty contest after another.

1152
01:24:09,300 --> 01:24:12,900
You know, school, then college, then work.

1153
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,000
Fuck that!

1154
01:24:15,100 --> 01:24:17,200
And fuck the Air Force Academy.

1155
01:24:17,300 --> 01:24:21,200
If I wanna fly, I'll find a way to fly.

1156
01:24:21,300 --> 01:24:24,500
You do what you love, and fuck the rest.

1157
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:32,700
I'm glad you're talking again, Dwayne.

1158
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,800
You're not nearly as stupid as you look.

1159
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:47,100
Wanna go back?

1160
01:24:47,300 --> 01:24:49,700
Not really.

1161
01:24:51,100 --> 01:24:54,000
Yeah, we should go back.

1162
01:24:56,400 --> 01:24:59,700
<i>And now, the moment
we've all been waiting for,</i>

1163
01:24:59,900 --> 01:25:02,300

# I wanna be a rodeo queen #

1174
01:25:44,500 --> 01:25:46,900
Yee-haw!

1175
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,600
Yodel-lay-he-hoo, that was great!

1176
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:09,200
Wow!

1177
01:26:09,300 --> 01:26:11,800
Funky-licious!

1178
01:26:34,500 --> 01:26:37,000
- I'm going backstage.
- Yeah, right. See ya.

1179
01:26:40,900 --> 01:26:44,100
Oh, look at you! Is that your costume?

1180
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:45,700
Mm-hm.

1181
01:26:47,200 --> 01:26:49,200
Okay, here.

1182
01:26:51,700 --> 01:26:53,000
Hey, what's going on?

1183
01:26:53,100 --> 01:26:55,500
Oh, I just came to wish Olive good luck.

1184
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:57,900
- How're you doing, honey?
- Good.

1185
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
- Nervous.
- Yeah. You're gonna do great.

1186
01:27:00,200 --> 01:27:01,800
I just know it.

1187
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Yeah.

1188
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:07,300
What's up?

1189
01:27:10,300 --> 01:27:12,500
I don't want her to go on.

1190
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:17,400
- Are you authorized to be backstage?
- No.

1191
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:20,700
- Hey, where are the dressing rooms?
- Are you allowed to be here?

1192
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:23,000
Just tell me where the dressing rooms are.

1193
01:27:23,100 --> 01:27:27,000
Listen, we're not in Albuquerque anymore.

1194
01:27:27,300 --> 01:27:29,700
- Hey, how are you feeling?
- Better. Where's Olive?

1195
01:27:29,800 --> 01:27:32,200
- There. What's up?
- Mom, I don't want Olive doing this.

1196
01:27:32,300 --> 01:27:34,900
- Oh, my God!
- Look around!

1197
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,300
- This place is fucked!
- He's right!

1198
01:27:37,400 --> 01:27:40,100
Look, I don't want these people
judging Olive. Fuck them!

1199
01:27:40,200 --> 01:27:42,800
- Listen, it is too late.
- No, it's not too late.

1200
01:27:42,900 --> 01:27:46,200
You're the mom,
and you're supposed to protect her.

1201
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:49,000
Everyone is gonna laugh at her, Mom.

1202
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:51,700
Please don't let her do this.

1203
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:54,000
Olive Hoover, 2 minutes.

1204
01:27:54,700 --> 01:27:57,500
Look, she's not a beauty queen.

1205
01:27:57,700 --> 01:27:59,700
She's just not.

1206
01:27:59,900 --> 01:28:02,000
- I'm gonna tell her.
- No, no, Dwayne. You listen to me.

1207
01:28:02,100 --> 01:28:03,800
Olive is who she is.

1208
01:28:03,900 --> 01:28:06,500
She has worked so hard.
She's poured everything into this.

1209
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:10,500
We can't just take it away from her.
We can't!

1210
01:28:10,700 --> 01:28:13,500
I know you wanna protect her. I know, honey...

1211
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:15,800
but we gotta let Olive be Olive.

1212
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:20,000
- Olive Hoover. Are you the family?
- Yeah.

1213
01:28:20,100 --> 01:28:21,300
Okay?

1214
01:28:22,700 --> 01:28:27,000
- Olive, it's time. You okay?
- Yeah.

1215
01:28:27,500 --> 01:28:30,500
- We gotta go now.
- Hang on.

1216
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:33,500
Olive, look at me.

1217
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,800
If you don't wanna do this, that's okay.

1218
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:41,600
If you wanna sit this one out, it's totally
fine by us. We're proud of you anyway.

1219
01:28:42,500 --> 01:28:44,700
We gotta go.

1220
01:28:47,500 --> 01:28:49,000
It's time.

1221
01:28:58,100 --> 01:29:00,100
Ready? Let's go.

1222
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
Good luck, honey.

1223
01:29:14,200 --> 01:29:18,000
Copy that. 25 is performance ready,
and we're walking.

1224
01:29:19,700 --> 01:29:21,200
As fast as we can.

1225
01:29:24,300 --> 01:29:25,300
Is she going on?

1226
01:29:25,400 --> 01:29:27,400
- Yeah.
- She's going on.

1227
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:32,800
Pure fairy-tale magic.

1228
01:29:32,900 --> 01:29:35,100
Miss Charisma Whiteman!

1229
01:29:36,100 --> 01:29:38,300
Wasn't that a stardust fantasy?

1230
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:39,400
Thank you for that.

1231
01:29:39,500 --> 01:29:42,100
You have been such a patient audience.

1232
01:29:42,200 --> 01:29:45,500
We have one more contestant,
and then we'll be crowning our winner.

1233
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:48,100
Please give a warm welcome to...

1234
01:29:48,300 --> 01:29:51,900
Miss... Olive Hoover!

1235
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:08,400
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1236
01:30:08,500 --> 01:30:12,800
I'd like to dedicate this to my grandpa,

1237
01:30:12,900 --> 01:30:15,100
who showed me these moves.

1238
01:30:15,200 --> 01:30:17,900
Oh, that is so sweet!

1239
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,900
Is he here? Where is your grandpa right now?

1240
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:24,300
In the trunk of our car.

1241
01:30:24,500 --> 01:30:25,800
Okay!

1242
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:29,000

On the condition that you never enter
your daughter in a beauty pageant

1297
01:35:15,800 --> 01:35:18,300
in the state of California ever again.

1298

Olive, your grandpa would've
been really proud of you.

- You were beyond great.

What in the world?!
