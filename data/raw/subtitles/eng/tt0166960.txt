00:00:35,209 --> 00:00:38,386
Can't catch me, slowpoke!

2
00:00:38,429 --> 00:00:40,083
Scrumpy, where you going?

3
00:00:40,127 --> 00:00:42,346
We're gonna be late for story time.

4
00:00:45,741 --> 00:00:47,090
Scrumpy, come back!

5
00:00:47,134 --> 00:00:48,874
Whoa!

6
00:00:48,918 --> 00:00:50,180
Whoo!

7
00:00:50,224 --> 00:00:53,096
Ha! I lost her!

8
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,184
Whoopee!

9
00:00:56,708 --> 00:00:58,580
You cheated!Sore loser!

10
00:01:00,756 --> 00:01:02,410
Are we late, Anabelle?
Are we?

11
00:01:02,453 --> 00:01:04,107
It was all her fault!

12
00:01:04,151 --> 00:01:05,413
It was not.

13
00:01:05,456 --> 00:01:07,067
Ah, ah, ah!

14
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:10,461
Do you angels want to hear the story or not?

15
00:01:10,505 --> 00:01:12,072
Oh, yes, Anabelle.

16
00:01:13,377 --> 00:01:14,770
Okay, okay.

17
00:01:14,813 --> 00:01:16,685
Okay.

18
00:01:16,728 --> 00:01:21,342
This is a holiday story about three ghosts,

19
00:01:21,385 --> 00:01:26,086
two bad dogs, and an evil witch!

20
00:01:26,129 --> 00:01:27,522
Ghosts?

21
00:01:30,829 --> 00:01:33,571
Huh! So it is a dumb old fairy-tale.

22
00:01:33,615 --> 00:01:36,922
No, no, no.
It's all true.

23
00:01:36,966 --> 00:01:40,883
In fact, the witch was my evil cousin.

24
00:01:40,926 --> 00:01:43,103
Belladonna!

25
00:01:44,191 --> 00:01:46,584
You mean the boogie-dog?

26
00:01:46,628 --> 00:01:48,282
Yes.

27
00:01:48,325 --> 00:01:52,155
This is how my two best guardian angels

28
00:01:52,199 --> 00:01:56,159
tried to stop her from ruining Christmas.

29
00:01:56,203 --> 00:01:59,293
Meet Charles Barkin,

30
00:01:59,336 --> 00:02:01,382
and Itchy Itchiford.

31
00:02:01,425 --> 00:02:03,471
Are they the ghosts?

32
00:02:03,514 --> 00:02:05,560
Well...

33
00:02:05,603 --> 00:02:07,823

37
00:02:14,873 --> 00:02:18,138

00:11:30,777 --> 00:11:33,562
I just... Ooh!
Let me at him!

190
00:11:33,605 --> 00:11:36,565
What kind of creep would do that?

191
00:11:36,608 --> 00:11:37,958
Charlie?

192
00:11:38,001 --> 00:11:40,743
Why'd that guy take all our stuff?

193
00:11:40,787 --> 00:11:42,876
Hey, never fear, little ones,

194
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:44,616
Santa's favorite reindeer

195
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:47,054
and his number one elf will get your presents back.

196
00:11:47,097 --> 00:11:49,186
Every single one.

197
00:11:50,405 --> 00:11:51,493
Thank you, Charlie.

198
00:11:51,536 --> 00:11:53,451
Yay! Yay! Yay!

199
00:11:54,409 --> 00:11:55,845
Thanks, Charlie.

200
00:11:55,889 --> 00:11:57,847
We'll get those goodies back from Carface

201
00:11:57,891 --> 00:12:00,067
before the mistletoe gets cold.

202
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:01,764
Hey, little man, it's getting late.

203
00:12:01,808 --> 00:12:03,548
I think it's time to get you home.

204
00:12:03,592 --> 00:12:06,856
Aw! I wanted to stay at the party.

205
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,945
But it's Christmas Eve.

206
00:12:08,989 --> 00:12:11,208
And you know Martha must be missing you.

207
00:12:11,252 --> 00:12:13,602
Yeah. You know...

208
00:12:13,645 --> 00:12:15,996
She's not so bad for a human.

209
00:12:18,259 --> 00:12:20,740
Am I going too fast, Timmy?

210
00:12:20,783 --> 00:12:24,091
No, no.
I'm okay.

211
00:12:24,134 --> 00:12:26,354
Look!
There's Martha!

212
00:12:30,967 --> 00:12:32,664
Timmy!
Come here, puppy.

213
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:34,014
Come here, boy!

214
00:12:34,057 --> 00:12:36,320
Thanks, Sasha.
Merry Christmas.

215
00:12:37,582 --> 00:12:40,672
Oh...

216
00:12:40,716 --> 00:12:42,022
Let's get you out of the cold.

217
00:12:42,065 --> 00:12:43,763
And I'll bandage your leg again, okay?

218
00:12:47,723 --> 00:12:49,246
Hey! Watch it!

219
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:50,813
Whoa! Watch what?

220
00:12:50,857 --> 00:12:52,032
I can't see a thing.

221
00:12:52,946 --> 00:12:54,208
Hey...

222
00:12:54,251 --> 00:12:55,949
Oh! Whoa! Oh!

223
00:12:55,992 --> 00:12:57,559
Whoa!
Easy, pal.

224
00:12:57,602 --> 00:12:58,865
Too much partying, huh?

225
00:13:00,867 --> 00:13:04,174
Ninety-four, 95, 96,

226
00:13:04,218 --> 00:13:06,829
97, 98, 99,

227
00:13:06,873 --> 00:13:08,265
100!

228
00:13:09,658 --> 00:13:11,529
Oh, boy, boss, you sure know how to...

229
00:13:21,888 --> 00:13:24,194
Oh, hi there.
I'm here to read the meter.

230
00:13:24,238 --> 00:13:26,806
What? 9:00 on Christmas eve?

231
00:13:26,849 --> 00:13:28,590
Yeah, holiday service.
Just point us...

232
00:13:28,633 --> 00:13:31,114
I mean me to the meter, sir.

233
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,161
Right up here, guys.

234
00:13:34,204 --> 00:13:36,380
Oh, sir...

235
00:13:36,424 --> 00:13:37,512
Hey, Charlie!

236
00:13:37,555 --> 00:13:38,687
Left.

237
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:40,515
Right! I mean, go ahead.

238
00:13:40,558 --> 00:13:41,646
Careful!

239
00:13:42,038 --> 00:13:43,300
Whoa!

240
00:13:43,344 --> 00:13:44,998
Be careful. Be careful.
Okay.

241
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:46,782
We're at the top of the stairs, so turn right.

242
00:13:55,356 --> 00:13:56,748
Nice try!

243
00:13:56,792 --> 00:13:58,446
And a merry humbug!

244
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:04,887
Well, maybe we should've tried a wig.

245
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:12,895
Are you sure this is a good idea, Charlie?

246
00:14:12,939 --> 00:14:15,550
I mean, a chimney?

247
00:14:16,812 --> 00:14:18,901
Hey, it works for Santa, right?

248
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,557
Ow!
Hey, quit shovin'!

249
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,037
Charlie, I'm stuck on something!

250
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,865
You're kiddin', right?
No, I really am.

251
00:14:25,908 --> 00:14:27,562
And in the twinkling,

252
00:14:27,605 --> 00:14:29,869
I heard on the roof...

253
00:14:29,912 --> 00:14:31,914
The prancing and yowling!

254
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:35,048
Of each little goof.

255
00:14:36,614 --> 00:14:37,920
Stop hissing at me.

256
00:14:37,964 --> 00:14:39,269
I'm not hissing.

257
00:14:39,313 --> 00:14:40,575
What?

258
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:51,847
It could've been worse!

259
00:14:59,724 --> 00:15:02,814
Steal Timmy's money, huh?

260
00:15:02,858 --> 00:15:04,904
Drop me in the trash, huh?

261
00:15:06,383 --> 00:15:08,472
And shoot me up a chimney, huh?

262
00:15:12,128 --> 00:15:14,478
Okay, that's it!

263
00:15:14,522 --> 00:15:17,046
Now we're gonna deck his hall!

264
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:17,960
Ready!

265
00:15:18,004 --> 00:15:20,528
Yahoo!

266
00:15:23,792 --> 00:15:27,187
Four, three, two, one.

267
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:28,666
Now!

268
00:15:35,108 --> 00:15:36,979
Told you we'd get in.

269
00:15:39,808 --> 00:15:43,203
Okay, Carface, give back Timmy's...

270
00:15:43,246 --> 00:15:44,987
Dough!

271
00:15:45,031 --> 00:15:49,426
Yeah.
You can't just waltz into our party and steal our stuff!

272
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:51,080
Sure I can.

273
00:15:51,124 --> 00:15:53,996
I've got this.
Remember?

274
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,433
Hand it over, smart guy!

275
00:15:56,477 --> 00:15:58,174
Ah, ah, ah!

276
00:15:58,218 --> 00:16:00,220
I'd love to, Charlie,

277
00:16:00,263 --> 00:16:03,136
but my boss just won't let me.

278
00:16:03,179 --> 00:16:06,400
Boss? You don't have a boss.

279
00:16:06,443 --> 00:16:09,838
Forgot me already, Chuckie?

280
00:16:15,235 --> 00:16:16,845
Belladonna!

281
00:16:16,888 --> 00:16:18,194
That's my name.

282
00:16:18,238 --> 00:16:20,196
Don't wear it out.

283
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,547
So, Chuckie, seems you stumbled

284
00:16:23,591 --> 00:16:26,768
onto my little plan, huh?

285
00:16:26,811 --> 00:16:28,074
Don't talk to her, Charlie.

286
00:16:28,117 --> 00:16:31,033
She's evil and nasty, and bad!

287
00:16:31,077 --> 00:16:34,558
At least I'm more fun than my goody two shoes cousin!

288
00:16:34,602 --> 00:16:38,171
Oh, look at me, Miss perfect Anabelle.

289
00:16:38,214 --> 00:16:40,434
Head angel, queen of the clouds.

290
00:16:40,477 --> 00:16:42,218
Watch me make it snow for the kiddies!

291
00:16:46,962 --> 00:16:48,224
Give me that!

292
00:16:48,268 --> 00:16:51,923
So what's this hotsy-totsy plan of yours, hmm?

293
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:55,144
Killer, do the honors.

294
00:16:55,188 --> 00:16:58,060
At midnight, when every dog in town

295
00:16:58,104 --> 00:17:00,889
is tucked into bed,

296
00:17:00,932 --> 00:17:03,065
we're gonna blow a magic dog whistle.

297
00:17:07,113 --> 00:17:08,244
Well...

298
00:17:08,288 --> 00:17:12,074
And all those darling Fidos and Fidettes

299
00:17:12,118 --> 00:17:14,163
will get that zombie look.

300
00:17:15,338 --> 00:17:18,689
Give! Give! Give!

301
00:17:20,517 --> 00:17:21,518
Give!

302
00:17:22,998 --> 00:17:25,087
And then they'll drag their master's gift

303
00:17:25,131 --> 00:17:26,871
right out of the doggy doors

304
00:17:26,915 --> 00:17:28,525
and bring 'em here to me.

305
00:17:30,223 --> 00:17:33,530
If chuckles here gets all the goodies,

306
00:17:33,574 --> 00:17:35,184
what do you get?

307
00:17:35,228 --> 00:17:37,099
Me? Hmm...

308
00:17:37,143 --> 00:17:39,406
I get to ruin Christmas!

309
00:17:40,711 --> 00:17:43,192
Except for one small point.

310
00:17:43,236 --> 00:17:46,935
This little toot couldn't wake a whole city.

311
00:17:46,978 --> 00:17:49,807
No. But this could!

312
00:17:54,377 --> 00:17:55,726
Ooh!

313
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:59,948
It's gigantically humongous.

314
00:17:59,991 --> 00:18:02,690
You just gotta stop her, Carface.

315
00:18:02,733 --> 00:18:03,908
I'm beggin' you!

316
00:18:03,952 --> 00:18:05,780
You know, Santa's watching you, Carface.

317
00:18:05,823 --> 00:18:06,911
He knows if you've been sleepin'.

318
00:18:06,955 --> 00:18:08,130
He knows if you're awake.

319
00:18:12,526 --> 00:18:16,356
Forget it, Itch.
You can't reason with flunkies.

320
00:18:16,399 --> 00:18:18,358
You gotta go to the source.

321
00:18:18,401 --> 00:18:22,275
Okay, Spiky, where's that big whistle, hmm?

322
00:18:26,801 --> 00:18:29,020
Ouch!

323
00:18:29,064 --> 00:18:33,112
Somewhere where you'll never find it, hot shot!

324
00:18:36,811 --> 00:18:40,815
Well, we're not leavin' till you tell us where it is!

325
00:18:40,858 --> 00:18:43,905
Hey, even Killer and me don't know.

326
00:18:43,948 --> 00:18:45,820
Do we? Yeah.

327
00:18:45,863 --> 00:18:47,300
We don't know anything.

328
00:18:51,434 --> 00:18:54,176
Oh, you'll be leaving all right.

329
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:56,613
Meet my fire imps!

330
00:18:56,657 --> 00:18:58,049
Whoa!

331
00:18:58,093 --> 00:18:59,660
Charlie!Come on Itch, let's go!

332
00:18:59,703 --> 00:19:02,141
Wait for me!
Come on, get the lead out!

333
00:19:02,184 --> 00:19:03,142
Down here!

334
00:19:04,012 --> 00:19:06,188
Ow! Ow! Ow!

335
00:19:06,232 --> 00:19:07,668
Come on!

336
00:19:08,451 --> 00:19:09,539
Ow!

337
00:19:13,108 --> 00:19:14,544
Giddy up!

338
00:19:14,588 --> 00:19:15,893
Left! This way!

339
00:19:18,244 --> 00:19:20,246
Down here!

340
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:43,660
Charlie, where do you suppose

341
00:19:43,704 --> 00:19:45,575
Belladonna hid that giant whistle?

342
00:19:59,676 --> 00:20:02,113
Ooh.
Well, that's gonna be tender.

343
00:20:02,157 --> 00:20:05,116
That's gonna be tender till the rose parade.

344
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:08,076
Or maybe even till June.

345
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:11,210
Mmm. Big yucks, Itch.
Really big yucks.

346
00:20:12,602 --> 00:20:15,779
Charlie, what do we do now?

347
00:20:15,823 --> 00:20:18,652
Ah, you got me, Itch.

348
00:20:18,695 --> 00:20:21,394
You mustn't give up, Charles.

349
00:20:21,437 --> 00:20:23,787
Whatever you say, Anabelle.

350
00:20:23,831 --> 00:20:25,049
Anabelle?

351
00:20:26,747 --> 00:20:28,836
Oh, goodie!
We could use your help!

352
00:20:28,879 --> 00:20:32,796
I have an urgent angelic mission for you both.

353
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:37,148
You must stop Belladonna's evil plot!

354
00:20:37,192 --> 00:20:39,673
This affects thousands of families.

355
00:20:39,716 --> 00:20:43,503
So failure is not an option!

356
00:20:43,546 --> 00:20:47,376
Anabelle, for once you don't have to ask me twice.

357
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:51,728
Yeah, Charlie!
Nobody rips off kids while we're on duty.

358
00:20:54,557 --> 00:20:58,996
Now, I've left you something
to help with your assignment.

359
00:21:00,346 --> 00:21:03,914
It will provide you with enough magic

360
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:06,830
to devise a major plan!

361
00:21:06,874 --> 00:21:09,703
A miracle dog tag!
Great!

362
00:21:09,746 --> 00:21:12,314
We'll find that big whistle in no time.

363
00:21:12,358 --> 00:21:13,968
Sorry, Charles,

364
00:21:14,011 --> 00:21:16,536
there's only so much I'm allowed to do.

365
00:21:16,579 --> 00:21:19,190
This tag won't locate the whistle.

366
00:21:19,234 --> 00:21:20,714
It will, however,

367
00:21:20,757 --> 00:21:25,196
help you find a way to foil Belladonna's plans.

368
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,895
So think, boys, think.

369
00:21:27,938 --> 00:21:32,029
It's up to you to save Christmas.

370
00:21:34,467 --> 00:21:37,296
Ah, I don't know.

371
00:21:37,339 --> 00:21:41,300
Do you think we could turn Carface into a good guy?

372
00:21:41,343 --> 00:21:42,475
Good guy? Ha!

373
00:21:42,518 --> 00:21:43,954
Don't make me laugh!

374
00:21:43,998 --> 00:21:46,130
That mutt is a total scrooge!

375
00:21:47,262 --> 00:21:51,222
Itchy, baby!
That's brilliant!

376
00:21:51,266 --> 00:21:53,007
Mmm, it is?

377
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:58,447
Yeah.
We're gonna run a scam on old Carface.

378
00:21:58,491 --> 00:22:01,624
A Dickens of a scam.

379
00:22:03,409 --> 00:22:04,975
Dickens?

380
00:22:05,019 --> 00:22:07,456
You know, that English guy who wrote...

381
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,241
A Christmas Carol!
Right!

382
00:22:10,285 --> 00:22:14,768
Now, remember how those three
ghosts came to visit Scrooge?

383
00:22:17,771 --> 00:22:20,251
Uh, no.

384
00:22:20,295 --> 00:22:22,906
I don't like ghosts.
Nothin' doin', Charlie.

385
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:24,821
Oh, don't worry, Itchy,

386
00:22:24,865 --> 00:22:27,258
you won't see any ghosts.

387
00:22:27,302 --> 00:22:30,044
You sure? 'Cause you're gonna be one.

388
00:22:30,087 --> 00:22:33,526
Come on, Itchykins, my boy.

389
00:22:33,569 --> 00:22:34,527
Are you serious?

390
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:35,963
You talkin' ghosts?

391
00:22:36,006 --> 00:22:39,358
Not for me, Charlie.
No way. Mmm-mmm!

392
00:22:40,271 --> 00:22:41,838
Oh, tag...

393
00:22:41,882 --> 00:22:46,190

394
00:22:46,234 --> 00:22:47,583
Ah!

395
00:23:17,439 --> 00:23:19,049
What do you want?

396
00:23:23,489 --> 00:23:25,447
What are you doing in bed anyway?

397
00:23:25,491 --> 00:23:28,276
Our big heist is at midnight.

398
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:31,801
Nah, I need my beauty rest so's I can look good!

399
00:23:31,845 --> 00:23:33,455
Now scram!

400
00:23:33,499 --> 00:23:34,456
Ow!

401
00:23:36,502 --> 00:23:37,459
Watch it!

402
00:23:37,503 --> 00:23:40,331
Television.

403
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,816
Bah, humbug!

404
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:49,471
I hate these Christmas specials!

405
00:23:49,515 --> 00:23:51,473
Welcome to CCN,

406
00:23:51,517 --> 00:23:53,432
the Carface Carruthers Network.

407
00:23:53,475 --> 00:23:54,476
Huh?

408
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,522
That's me!

409
00:23:59,481 --> 00:24:02,658
Good evening.
I'm Jacob Charlie.

410
00:24:02,702 --> 00:24:05,487
Welcome to our holiday special,

411
00:24:05,531 --> 00:24:08,925
"It's a Wonderful Carface."

412
00:24:12,276 --> 00:24:14,061
Uh-uh.

413
00:24:14,104 --> 00:24:16,063
I don't think so.

414
00:24:19,109 --> 00:24:23,462
In this story, you will be visited by three ghosts!

415
00:24:23,505 --> 00:24:26,726
Each will arrive
at the chiming of a bell.

416
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:30,469
I'll ring your bell, buddy!

417
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,650
Ah, there's the first one.

418
00:24:37,693 --> 00:24:40,522
Time for ghost number one.

419
00:24:40,566 --> 00:24:44,570
So let's go back to a simpler time.

420
00:24:48,095 --> 00:24:50,401
That's where I was born!

421
00:25:00,586 --> 00:25:03,545
Hey, what gives?

422
00:25:03,589 --> 00:25:05,504
Huh?

423
00:25:18,778 --> 00:25:22,172
Itchy, what's going on?

424
00:25:22,216 --> 00:25:26,263
I am not Itchy!
I am the Ghost of Christmas Past!

425
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,614
With short legs!

426
00:25:30,354 --> 00:25:32,139
Oh...

427
00:25:32,182 --> 00:25:34,576
Do I look like I was born yesterday?

428
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:35,708
Huh?

429
00:25:35,751 --> 00:25:37,623
As a matter of fact, yes!

430
00:25:39,625 --> 00:25:42,584
Mom?
That's my mom!

431
00:25:42,628 --> 00:25:45,631
Yeah, and that's you, only smaller.

432
00:25:47,284 --> 00:25:51,506
Mom, it's me, Carface.

433
00:25:54,291 --> 00:25:57,294
Oh, she can't hear you.
This is the past.

434
00:25:58,295 --> 00:26:01,560
You know, like a flashback.

435
00:26:01,603 --> 00:26:03,953
Boy, this really brings back memories.

436
00:26:03,997 --> 00:26:06,782
I miss my brothers and sisters.

437
00:26:06,826 --> 00:26:09,045
I bet they don't miss you.

438
00:26:11,657 --> 00:26:14,877
Wasn't I precious?

439
00:26:15,661 --> 00:26:17,619
Pushy is more like it.

440
00:26:17,663 --> 00:26:20,883
Yeah. But Mom still loved me.

441
00:26:22,537 --> 00:26:26,585
That was our last Christmas together.

442
00:26:26,628 --> 00:26:29,675
I never spent another holiday with Mom.

443
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:35,855
Oh, Mom...

444
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:39,162
I miss you.

445
00:26:39,206 --> 00:26:41,382
Come! We have other places to see!

446
00:26:41,425 --> 00:26:43,297
But I want to watch how cute I am.

447
00:26:50,347 --> 00:26:52,088

448
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:58,181
Hey, it's the Parker house.

00:32:36,258 --> 00:32:37,999
But, Charlie,

554
00:32:38,043 --> 00:32:40,871
there's only an hour and a half left till Christmas.

555
00:32:40,915 --> 00:32:42,221
I know that, Itch.

556
00:32:42,264 --> 00:32:45,964
That's why we've got to unleash part two

557
00:32:46,007 --> 00:32:47,922
of the miracle.

558
00:32:49,054 --> 00:32:52,013
Come, ye storms and grow in strife.

559
00:32:52,057 --> 00:32:55,147
Split the sky with lightning rife.

560
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:58,019
Strike at midnight like a knife,

561
00:32:58,063 --> 00:33:01,805
and bring to my creation life!

562
00:33:01,849 --> 00:33:04,025
Christmas is finished!

563
00:33:04,069 --> 00:33:05,766
Finished!

564
00:33:20,085 --> 00:33:21,434
Huh?

565
00:33:21,477 --> 00:33:24,132
Ah! Another ghost!

566
00:33:30,312 --> 00:33:33,446
Aw, stupid dreams.

567
00:33:37,972 --> 00:33:39,104
Huh?

568
00:33:44,239 --> 00:33:45,414
Ah!

569
00:33:54,293 --> 00:33:56,295
Maybe a little music

570
00:33:57,252 --> 00:33:58,993
will calm my nerves.

571
00:34:01,126 --> 00:34:05,086
Locally, a sudden low pressure
system has hit the bay area,

572
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:08,089
causing unexpected storm clouds.

573
00:34:08,133 --> 00:34:10,396
And at the tone, the time will be

574
00:34:10,439 --> 00:34:13,834
past your bedtime, Carface!

575
00:34:13,877 --> 00:34:15,096

576
00:34:16,489 --> 00:34:17,707

Not again!

No more ghosts, you hear me?

00:34:31,156 --> 00:34:33,897

585
00:35:02,012 --> 00:35:04,189

00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:56,929
♪ We know that it's Christmas at last ♪

925
00:53:56,972 --> 00:53:59,105
Not now!

926
00:53:59,148 --> 00:54:00,498
Huh? Huh?

927
00:54:27,351 --> 00:54:31,964
Just think, here sits the worst threat to Christmas ever!

928
00:54:32,007 --> 00:54:35,141
And nobody suspects that it's right here!

929
00:54:35,184 --> 00:54:37,709
On Alcatraz Island!

930
00:55:06,172 --> 00:55:08,174
Pull the tarp!

931
00:55:42,556 --> 00:55:44,036
Soon the storm will break,

932
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:46,908
and lightning will race down here to the steam generator.

933
00:55:46,952 --> 00:55:49,389
Then the whistle will blow and every mutt

934
00:55:49,433 --> 00:55:54,612
in San Francisco will fall under my spell!

935
00:55:58,442 --> 00:56:01,619
Now get to work, slugs.
It's almost midnight.

936
00:56:32,084 --> 00:56:34,434
Carface, get to the console!

937
00:56:34,478 --> 00:56:37,306
Yes, sir...
Uh, ma'am!

938
00:56:37,350 --> 00:56:38,830
Am I really gonna do this?

939
00:56:38,873 --> 00:56:40,353
What about Timmy?

940
00:56:52,583 --> 00:56:54,411
Ready on the controls.

941
00:56:55,847 --> 00:56:57,022
Uh...

942
00:56:57,065 --> 00:56:58,066
Uh-uh.

943
00:57:19,523 --> 00:57:20,915
Any luck?

944
00:57:20,959 --> 00:57:22,482
I'm sorry, Charlie.

945
00:57:22,526 --> 00:57:24,136
We ran our paws off.

946
00:57:24,179 --> 00:57:26,486
But we couldn't find a trace
of that whistle anywhere.

947
00:57:26,530 --> 00:57:29,358
Yeah, me neither.

948
00:57:29,402 --> 00:57:30,882
You tried, Charlie.

949
00:57:30,925 --> 00:57:32,666
We did everything heavenly possible!

950
00:57:44,199 --> 00:57:46,506
Don't worry.
It'll be okay.

951
00:58:01,565 --> 00:58:04,742
One minute to Christmas,

952
00:58:04,785 --> 00:58:06,483
sugars!

953
00:58:16,231 --> 00:58:17,798
Pull the lever!

954
00:58:51,615 --> 00:58:52,616
Huh?

955
00:59:14,072 --> 00:59:15,595
It's working!

956
00:59:15,639 --> 00:59:18,250
Christmas is ruined!

957
00:59:24,648 --> 00:59:27,389
You just gotta stop her, Carface!

958
00:59:27,433 --> 00:59:29,827
I'm beggin' you!

959
00:59:29,870 --> 00:59:32,133
You know all the angles.

960
00:59:32,177 --> 00:59:34,092
You figure it out.

961
00:59:39,271 --> 00:59:42,970
Without proper care, this will be his last Christmas.

962
00:59:43,014 --> 00:59:44,232
Last Christmas.

963
00:59:44,668 --> 00:59:49,586
Ah! No, no, no.

964
00:59:51,805 --> 00:59:53,677
I won't let it happen!

965
00:59:58,029 --> 00:59:59,987
Whoa! Huh?

966
01:00:03,687 --> 01:00:06,603
Put it back!

967
01:00:34,543 --> 01:00:36,720
I've gotta do something.

968
01:00:40,071 --> 01:00:42,377
Get off!
Let go!

969
01:00:48,862 --> 01:00:50,342
I gotta stop this!

970
01:00:50,385 --> 01:00:51,691
I gotta save Timmy.

971
01:00:51,735 --> 01:00:54,520
Give him another chance for that operation.

972
01:01:08,055 --> 01:01:09,143
Aw...

973
01:01:18,152 --> 01:01:20,198
This is for Timmy!

974
01:01:29,773 --> 01:01:31,296
No!

975
01:01:47,181 --> 01:01:48,400
Huh?

♪ You got zapped And not me

977
01:02:09,813 --> 01:02:11,945
♪ You got zapped And not me

978
01:02:11,989 --> 01:02:13,947
♪ You got zapped...

979
01:02:15,819 --> 01:02:17,385
Ow!

980
01:02:17,429 --> 01:02:20,258
What happened?

981
01:02:23,043 --> 01:02:24,784
It was all...

982
01:02:24,828 --> 01:02:26,177
Yes?

983
01:02:26,220 --> 01:02:27,787
My fault.

984
01:02:28,832 --> 01:02:32,357
For once, he took the rap.

985
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:33,662
Wow!

986
01:02:33,706 --> 01:02:35,882
I don't care who takes the rap!

987
01:02:35,926 --> 01:02:37,666
You're both gonna get it!

988
01:02:37,710 --> 01:02:41,453
Nobody double-crosses Belladonna and lives!

989
01:02:42,584 --> 01:02:43,803
Halt!

990
01:02:43,847 --> 01:02:46,937
You will not harm these two.

991
01:02:46,980 --> 01:02:49,243
Anabelle, get out of my line of fire!

992
01:02:49,287 --> 01:02:52,812
Try it, and I'll clip your wings!

993
01:02:52,856 --> 01:02:55,772
That bug belongs to me!

994
01:02:55,815 --> 01:02:58,818
No, cousin, people belong to themselves.

995
01:02:58,862 --> 01:03:02,039
So they can choose between good or evil.

996
01:03:02,082 --> 01:03:05,042
And it's my duty to protect that.

997
01:03:09,873 --> 01:03:11,918
You protect him from me?

998
01:03:11,962 --> 01:03:14,268
With what?
A smile and a sunbeam?

999
01:03:14,312 --> 01:03:17,706
Your ways are big and fiery.

1000
01:03:17,750 --> 01:03:21,841
So I will stop you with something small and cool.

1001
01:03:50,652 --> 01:03:52,306
Snowflakes?

1002
01:03:52,350 --> 01:03:54,134
Snow can't stop me!

1003
01:04:00,445 --> 01:04:02,926
Duck!

1004
01:04:09,541 --> 01:04:11,195
Dang!

1005
01:04:11,238 --> 01:04:14,111
Ha! Nobody messes with heaven.

1006
01:04:14,154 --> 01:04:16,722
Ah... Thanks, Anabelle.

1007
01:04:16,765 --> 01:04:19,333
Ah, pish!

1008
01:04:19,377 --> 01:04:21,031
Think nothing of it.

1009
01:04:21,074 --> 01:04:24,338
You did all the work, Mr. Carruthers.

1010
01:04:24,382 --> 01:04:27,298
Oh, yeah!
Great work, big guy.

1011
01:04:27,341 --> 01:04:30,040
Oh, I feel a group hug coming on!

1012
01:04:30,083 --> 01:04:32,172
Or not.

1013
01:04:33,043 --> 01:04:34,914
Somewhere deep inside you

1014
01:04:34,958 --> 01:04:37,917
is a sliver of good, Mr. Carruthers.

1015
01:04:37,961 --> 01:04:41,051
Try to let it out more often.

1016
01:04:41,094 --> 01:04:44,576
Oh, look, boss, we're headed for home.

1017
01:04:44,619 --> 01:04:47,144
Oh! And good work!

1018
01:05:05,118 --> 01:05:06,467
Snow! Snow!

1019
01:05:08,992 --> 01:05:11,168
Hey, Mr. Reindeer,

1020
01:05:11,211 --> 01:05:13,997
look, you made it snow after all!

1021
01:05:14,649 --> 01:05:15,912
Thanks!

1022
01:05:18,653 --> 01:05:19,916
Wow!

1023
01:05:19,959 --> 01:05:21,961
Charlie, what does this mean?

1024
01:05:22,005 --> 01:05:24,572
It means our plan worked.

1025
01:05:24,616 --> 01:05:28,794
We convinced Carface to save Christmas!

1026
01:05:28,837 --> 01:05:30,927
Actually, Charlie, the final decision

1027
01:05:30,970 --> 01:05:32,537
belonged to Carface.

1028
01:05:32,580 --> 01:05:35,627
Yes, and he chose correctly.

1029
01:05:35,670 --> 01:05:39,109
See? I told you all along we could trust him.

1030
01:05:39,152 --> 01:05:40,980
Ow!

1031
01:05:41,024 --> 01:05:43,983
Well, congratulations

1032
01:05:44,027 --> 01:05:46,725
on your most important mission.

1033
01:05:46,768 --> 01:05:50,555
This will be a story to repeat for years to come.

1034
01:05:56,865 --> 01:05:58,867
I just feel so bad for those pups

1035
01:05:58,911 --> 01:06:01,609
because we don't have any P-R-E-S...

1036
01:06:01,653 --> 01:06:03,002
Uh...

1037
01:06:03,046 --> 01:06:05,004
Gifts left, you know.

1038
01:06:05,048 --> 01:06:06,571
Ho! Ho! Ho!

1039
01:06:06,614 --> 01:06:08,486
Merry Christmas!

1040
01:06:11,054 --> 01:06:13,273
Merry Christmas!

1041
01:06:15,058 --> 01:06:17,277
It's easy for him to be jolly!

1042
01:06:19,062 --> 01:06:21,978
He's not pulling this darn thing!

1043
01:06:22,021 --> 01:06:23,022
Ow!

1044
01:06:23,066 --> 01:06:26,112
Here you go, kids!
Here you are!

1045
01:06:36,818 --> 01:06:38,907

1046
01:06:38,951 --> 01:06:41,040

1047
01:06:41,084 --> 01:06:43,042
Hey, you kiddin'?

1048
01:06:43,086 --> 01:06:45,262
I added lots of new stuff too.

1049
01:06:45,305 --> 01:06:47,046
No foolin'?

1050
01:06:47,090 --> 01:06:49,048
Hey, nice going.

1051
01:06:49,092 --> 01:06:52,269
Ain't I a little dickens?

1052
01:06:52,312 --> 01:06:54,967
Hey! And I want you to meet my new pal!

1053
01:06:56,229 --> 01:06:57,274
Timmy!

1054
01:06:57,317 --> 01:06:58,666
Look, Charlie!

1055
01:06:58,710 --> 01:07:00,625
Uncle Carface filled it up full!

1056
01:07:00,668 --> 01:07:02,409
Uncle?

1057
01:07:02,453 --> 01:07:05,064
I never thought I'd hear myself bark these words,

1058
01:07:05,108 --> 01:07:08,285
but you did the right thing for once.

1059
01:07:08,328 --> 01:07:12,245
Don't expect it to last long.

1060
01:07:12,289 --> 01:07:14,291
I still got a business to run, you know.

1061
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:19,078
At least you were sweet for a day.

1062
01:07:19,122 --> 01:07:20,645
Aw!

1063
01:07:20,688 --> 01:07:22,473
This calls for a song!

1064
01:07:24,257 --> 01:07:26,172
Okay, now go. Now.

1065
01:07:26,216 --> 01:07:27,826
Now!

1066
01:07:31,134 --> 01:07:33,440
