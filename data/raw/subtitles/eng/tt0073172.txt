1
00:00:10,276 --> 00:00:13,575
Yeah, well, it's 409 cubic inches.

2
00:00:13,646 --> 00:00:15,546
Hey, is this in color?

3
00:00:18,985 --> 00:00:21,078
Hey, Larry, you got a church key?

4
00:00:21,154 --> 00:00:23,179
Hey, I thought this was in color.

5
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,457
Gross.

6
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:30,621
Looks like a homo to me.

7
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:32,187
Takes one to know one, doesn't it?

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,868
- Did she laugh at his leverage?
- This is disgusting.

9
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:40,769
- Hey! Hit her, dumb-ass.
- Yeah!

10
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:43,172
A little guided muscle.

11
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:45,675
- Where'd you pick up this flick?
- Hollywood Boulevard.

12
00:00:45,745 --> 00:00:48,179
This old shit goes for $1 a yard.

13
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:52,184
- Sit down!
- Get out of the way!

14
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:54,447
- This is cute.
- Sit down.

15
00:00:54,854 --> 00:00:57,152
Get the fuck out.

16
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:02,328
- You guys are sick.
- Come on. One more time, man.

17
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:05,295
- Slap the shit out of her!
- God damn it.

18
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,091
Hey, what up? No come shots?

19
00:01:08,201 --> 00:01:10,294
Yeah, where's the fucking come shot?

20
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:17,143
Hey, where's the come shot, man?

21
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:19,377
Hey, where's the come shot?

22
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,243
Are you kidding?

23
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:45,284
Hey, you ought to speak to the cop
at the gate. He forgot to ask for my pass.

24
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:48,789
- You're late.
- Is that so?

25
00:03:50,029 --> 00:03:51,696
How would you know?

26
00:03:51,697 --> 00:03:53,362
I can tell. I'm two
shots under the label.

27
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:56,061
Too bad. Three shots under
and you couldn't have told shit.

28
00:03:56,135 --> 00:03:58,433
Four shots under
and you'd be on your way out...

29
00:03:58,504 --> 00:03:59,994
'cause I'd be crawling back in bed.

30
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:02,836
Not today I wouldn't,
'cause Big Mac is coming, remember?

31
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:05,835
- I meant to get the pool cleaned.
- You kidding?

32
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:08,209
- I'm kidding.
- You ought to do that.

33
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:11,417
- You really ought to get the pool cleaned.
- Where would I piss?

34
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:14,578
Pipes still on the fritz?
Why don't you use the sink?

35
00:04:15,054 --> 00:04:17,648
Hey, what kind of a guy do you think I am?

36
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:20,382
I've got to eat off the
dishes in that sink.

37
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:23,793
- So why don't you wash the dishes?
- Why don't you wash the dishes?

38
00:04:23,863 --> 00:04:27,230
- I told you, I don't do dishes.
- I know, I've been to your place.

39
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,063
Not in a coon's age.

40
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:32,335
You ain't been nowhere in a coon's age.

41
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:39,807
- They was talking about you last night.
- Who? Forget it.

42
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:41,736
Okay.

43
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:47,413
Okay. Go.

44
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:50,413
There's this guy named Clark Gable.

45
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:52,987
- Who?
- His name's Clark Gable.

46
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:55,254
He's the new kid, the
new kid over at Pathé.

47
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:57,922
He was asking that windbag
von Stroheim about you.

48
00:04:57,997 --> 00:05:00,090
That lard ass. What'd he say?

49
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:03,602
- He said you were a stupid son of a bitch.
- No, I mean this...

50
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:07,137
Gable, whatever.
Where did this happen anyway?

51
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,403
Where do you think?
I was waiting on their table.

52
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:12,535
- He says, I hear you-
- Okay, skip it.

53
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:16,639
Wait a second. After the lard ass
tells him what an asshole you were...

54
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:20,550
this Gable kid says, "Yeah? Well, I think
the Boy Wonder is just about the...

55
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,180
"only genius that ever worked
in the cinema."

56
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:26,257
- The what?
- Cinema.

57
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:31,894
He meant movies. He'll learn.
He's the new kid over at Pathé.

58
00:05:31,964 --> 00:05:34,091
- Okay, skip it.
- Wait a minute...

59
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,829
I mean, here comes the finish.
He says, "By the by...

60
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:39,997
"now what the hell ever happened to him?
Where is the Boy Wonder?"

61
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:43,133
You know what lard ass says?
He says, "He's a rummy...

62
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:45,234
"down on Hollywood Boulevard.

63
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:48,371
"I seen him there
and gave him a quarter just yesterday."

64
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:50,245
Lying son of a bitch.

65
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:52,613
Can you believe the nerve of the guy?

66
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:55,119
So I told them.

67
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:58,888
You what?

68
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:01,254
I told them...

69
00:06:01,327 --> 00:06:05,787
I says, "The Boy Wonder, he's got a swell
six-picture contract, working steady...

70
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:08,993
"working everyday,
which is more than I can say for you."

71
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:12,868
- What are you telling me here, Harlene?
- I'm telling you, I told them.

72
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:17,335
Don't worry. I didn't tell them what
or about Big Mac or nothing.

73
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:21,676
I just told them that you was
working, about the six-picture contract.

74
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:26,006
I did say one thing. It shut them
up though, you should've seen it.

75
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:29,179
What did you say, Harlene?

76
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:33,157
You know that lard ass, that heinie lard
bucket, pretended he didn't even know me.

77
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,786
He knew me okay, boy,
I did a picture with him in '22...

78
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:38,456
and I used to pork him plenty
when he was still straight.

79
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:41,796
Okay, what did you tell them
last night, Harlene?

80
00:06:42,668 --> 00:06:45,967
He says, "A six-picture contract?
Where is he working?

81
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:49,474
"Gower Gulch?" I says, "Chuck you, Farley!

82
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:54,002
"He's working at home,
and he don't even have to leave his house."

83
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:58,849
That's beautiful. That's really terrific.

84
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:02,647
That's really smart, Harlene.
I want to thank you a lot.

85
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:06,086
Natch. You been good to me, kid.

86
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:09,992
You seen my lucky necktie?

87
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,914
Yes, it's right where
you left it yesterday.

88
00:07:12,915 --> 00:07:15,297
Listen, you didn't happen to...

89
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:20,439
tell him where I was living
or my address or anything?

90
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:23,270
Sure, I did.
This Clark Gable wanted to know.

91
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:25,902
He said he'd like to come out
and talk to you sometime.

92
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:27,775
- It was all a real enema to him.
- Enigma.

93
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:30,281
- He loved ghost stories.
- Ghost stories?

94
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:32,078
Why, you, kiddo. You're the ghost story.

95
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:41,292
Give me a hand.

96
00:07:41,293 --> 00:07:43,692
You don't think von
Stroheim is going to...

97
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:47,095
Come over here? What the hell for?
He's working, ain't he?

98
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:51,302
- What if this kid comes over?
- This Clark Gable?

99
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:53,565
You can brush him. He's just a kid.

100
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,971
Listen, I think I must
tell you that you're-

101
00:07:55,972 --> 00:07:58,303
- Using too much of
this stuff, Harlene.

102
00:07:58,377 --> 00:08:00,311
Go on off your high horse.

103
00:08:00,312 --> 00:08:02,245
I just can't help
thinking about Wally Reid.

104
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:05,944
You, too? He was a swell kid.

105
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:08,386
We used to have a lot of laughs,
me and him.

106
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:10,980
And Jack Pickford?

107
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:15,250
We used to
piss the hell out of that bunch of...

108
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,455
stuffed shirts at his sister's dump.

109
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:22,459
- That Wally was a caution.
- Yeah, died in his own vomit...

110
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:24,659
in a padded cell,
good-looking guy like that.

111
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:26,534
- He didn't look too good in the end.
- No.

112
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:30,569
Me and Jackie paid him a visit,
snuck him a shot.

113
00:08:33,212 --> 00:08:36,147
Hold it steady. Okay.

114
00:08:46,225 --> 00:08:47,624
That's the ticket.

115
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:55,598
How long till
Rex, the Wonder Dog, gets here?

116
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:02,569
He will be a little late.
He's got a funeral this morning...

117
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:04,439
but we can get in a couple of inserts.

118
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:07,310
A couple inserts?

119
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:16,616
I'm Mabel if you're able!

120
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:17,713
Cut it out, Harlene.

121
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:21,488
Come on, honey. You give up too easy,
that's your problem.

122
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:22,787
Come on, Harlene.

123
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:28,064
I ain't kidding you, honey. You could
do it once, you could do it again.

124
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:33,099
- Could you do it once?
- Yeah.

125
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,168
You're the Boy Wonder, aren't you?

126
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:43,975
Feel them peels.

127
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:53,716
Meat. It's all meat in
a see-through wrapper.

128
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,527
So you know what you're getting.

129
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:01,700
Come on, honey, give it a chance.

130
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,063
Put your hand back there, come on.

131
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:09,463
Soft.

132
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,608
Just use your fingertips.

133
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:20,681
There, that's the ticket.

134
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:25,080
Make it screech.

135
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:40,638
Grab it soft and slide up and down it.

136
00:10:47,713 --> 00:10:49,305
So you know what's in there?

137
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,510
You remember.

138
00:10:57,623 --> 00:10:59,284
It's warm in there.

139
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:04,963
How does that feel?

140
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:09,823
Now slow.

141
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:20,504
Go up slower. It's getting wet for you.

142
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:31,680
You make me feel all goosy inside.

143
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,860
This is stupid, you know, really stupid.

144
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:40,230
You was getting there,
you was really getting there.

145
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:41,664
Maybe you were getting there.

146
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:45,830
What's the diff? I was taking you with me.
Don't you know that's how it's done?

147
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:48,203
Let's forget it. We have
a lot of work to do.

148
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:52,608
You got work to do. All I got to do is
roll over for Rex, the Wonder Dog.

149
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:59,646
- I'm trying to do you a favor.
- Well, skip it.

150
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:04,217
Come on, honey, now give it a chance.

151
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:09,021
I feel something down there. Yeah, I do.

152
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:11,086
I said we had work to do.

153
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:18,998
Come on now. Get up.

154
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:23,501
Look at your arm.

155
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:26,310
You punched a hole in that arm
the size of a dime.

156
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:28,972
How am I going to shoot around that?
Jesus Christ.

157
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:34,352
Will you get over here?

158
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,059
Sit on the bed.

159
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:46,790
Try to remember what you were
doing yesterday.

160
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:50,825
Isn't that a caution?
After trying all night to forget.

161
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:56,465
Okay, come on.

162
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,575
- Look good.
- Try it.

163
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,545
Okay.

164
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:12,549
What is it?

165
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:17,721
Come on. Let's have it.

166
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:23,301
What you said about my arm.

167
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,439
You shouldn't have said that about my arm
like that.

168
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:34,078
- Why do you want to make me feel...
- Oh, hey.

169
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:38,446
Come on. Hey, Harlene.

170
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:41,876
Hey, you know me.

171
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:48,618
Here's looking at you.

172
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:54,632
Here's looking at the two of us.

173
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:07,692
That's more like the old Kid.

174
00:14:07,693 --> 00:14:10,007
Sure, I was just feeling
a little morbid...

175
00:14:10,482 --> 00:14:13,747
you know, about old Wally and all.
That's all.

176
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:17,787
You shouldn't do that. You shouldn't
think so much about the past.

177
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:21,086
You're doing swell if you think about it.

178
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:23,923
- Why, we've got a six-picture contract.
- Sure.

179
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:26,792
We don't even have to leave,
we're working at home.

180
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:29,432
That's the ticket.

181
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:32,561
Hors d'oeuvres. Restaurant.

182
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:36,533
All right. Let's go! Quiet on the set!

183
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:39,169
Hey, you bozos aren't getting paid
to play pinochle.

184
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:43,841
Okay, now. It's a light, not a chair.
It goes on the lady's face.

185
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:46,384
Okeydokey, we're almost ready to go.

186
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:49,319
All right then. What? Who is here?

187
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,053
On my set?

188
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:55,790
May I introduce you to our producer?
Never allow producers on the set.

189
00:14:55,861 --> 00:14:57,522
Okeydokey now.

190
00:14:57,863 --> 00:15:02,300
You know the scene. You're alone,
you are forlorn.

191
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:04,928
Your lover, premature ejaculation...

192
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:08,064
Winnetka High graduate, 1918,
is missing in action.

193
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:16,909
You are sad. You are distraught with grief.

194
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:20,785
Okay, for real.

195
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:25,553
Give it to me for real. That's it, Harlene.

196
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:33,365
You're all alone, baby.
There's nobody here but you.

197
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:36,226
And there's nobody coming, honey.

198
00:15:37,002 --> 00:15:41,336
That's it. That's beautiful.
Wally's dead, Harlene.

199
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:46,267
Wally's dead and no one else
is coming home.

200
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:49,208
That's it. Beautiful!

201
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:54,584
Now, you hear footsteps.

202
00:15:56,055 --> 00:16:00,856
You hear footsteps,
and the door is opening, and you turn...

203
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:06,425
and it's him! It's him!

204
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:11,466
You greet him as only one whose heart
has remained lily white can do!

205
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:21,201
Cut.

206
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,820
You are fucking terrific.

207
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:54,037
If it ain't Rex, the Wonder Dog,
come to show us his bone.

208
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:58,541
Stick the Hershey Kisses
back in the bag, will you, sweetheart?

209
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:00,641
I haven't had my breakfast yet.

210
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:10,855
Rex, are you going to stand there
oiling your cuff links...

211
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:14,387
on the top of your head all morning,
or are you going to go to work?

212
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:17,592
I may work, I may not.

213
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:22,931
All depends if we quit in time for me to be
at the Beverly Hills Hotel by 4:00.

214
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:26,111
What are they, hiring dancing partners
or something?

215
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:29,238
That's funny stuff coming from
a hophead ass-slinger, you know.

216
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:31,976
Lay off. Come on, you wanna get paid?

217
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:35,343
What do you think I'm doing here?
Where's Big Mac?

218
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:40,751
You don't think he'll show?
Let's go to work.

219
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:44,853
I told you, I'm supposed to be
at the Beverly Hills Hotel by 4:00.

220
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,032
Oh, really?

221
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:50,034
I met someone today
who's taken an interest in my work.

222
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:52,400
They are. They're hiring dancing partners.

223
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:55,497
- Geez, a swank dump like that.
- Now listen, sister.

224
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:58,107
Who is it, if you don't mind my asking?

225
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:03,370
Someone who's very sweet.
Someone who's a big cheese at Metro.

226
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:06,878
Someone whose name I'd rather not mention
in this...

227
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:08,977
insane asylum, thank you very much.

228
00:18:12,157 --> 00:18:15,183
You meeting him in the Polo Lounge
or up in his room?

229
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:19,424
- His room. I told you, he's a big cheese.
- A big cheese?

230
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:23,829
The room doesn't happen to be
on the third floor, does it, Rex?

231
00:18:25,003 --> 00:18:27,836
Yeah, as a matter of fact it does.

232
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:33,410
Okay. I'll try to get you out of here
by 4:00, Rex.

233
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:37,812
It's a pretty old gag, but you may get
a new pair of pants out of it.

234
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:40,050
God knows you could use them.

235
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:44,752
What is this? Clue me in.

236
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:47,653
What, and spoil one of
life's little surprises?

237
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,787
He said I had star potential.

238
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,865
Gee, Rex, we could have told you that.

239
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:01,403
Let's go to work.

240
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:08,503
Where'd you meet this big cheese? You
were supposed to be working this morning.

241
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:11,777
I was working. He was at the funeral.

242
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:14,911
Caught him watching me
while I lowered the stiff.

243
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:18,445
His car was parked by the shed
when I went to put my shovel away.

244
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:20,424
Funny kind of guy, you know.

245
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:23,757
Great big Packard and this little
Mexican kid for a driver...

246
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:26,262
couldn't have been more than 14 at tops.

247
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:29,931
He walks right up to me
and says I got star potential.

248
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:34,135
- Who? The taco or the big cheese?
- You're a sketch, you know?

249
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,070
He says he knows I got style...

250
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:40,837
cause I'm dumping dirt on this doornail
in a pair of white ducks.

251
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:46,240
That's it in this town, you know?
Deportment. It's all in your deportment.

252
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:50,913
Very good rule of thumb. Why don't
you write it down? Very good rule of...

253
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:54,015
- Leave the ascot on. I got an idea.
- That reminds me...

254
00:19:54,092 --> 00:19:55,320
I had an idea this morning.

255
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:57,487
Take a couple aspirin,
it'll be gone by lunch.

256
00:19:57,563 --> 00:19:59,554
Now hold on, this is a hot one!

257
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:03,265
I pull my shorts up, see,
way up around my stomach.

258
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:06,800
Then I suck it in, see?
Get them on there real tight.

259
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:09,266
And then, when I'm ready...

260
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:12,575
pow, I slam it up there
like a brick shithouse!

261
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:21,145
It tears them, see?
Tears my shorts right up the middle.

262
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:25,188
And then you grab a shot of her going
bananas for it, see? You get the picture?

263
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:28,192
Of course, you got to pay for the shorts.

264
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:31,963
Very interesting idea, Rex.
Where did you get an idea like that?

265
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:35,261
San Berdoo, on my way over this morning.
Think it'll work?

266
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:39,001
Why don't you give it a try?
This afternoon at the Beverly Hills Hotel.

267
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,096
- Now take your pants off.
- Oh, smart guy?

268
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:43,903
How come if you're so smart,
you never leave this house?

269
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:46,240
That's called your basic
rhetorical question.

270
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:48,404
- Now off with the shorts.
- Anything you say.

271
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,643
You're the Boy Wonder, but I'm gonna tell
Big Mac about this.

272
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:54,743
He knows a hot one when he sees it.
Big Mac will go bananas for it.

273
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:58,847
Really? Speaking of stunted bananas,
you want to slap some life into that thing?

274
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:01,017
Time is money.
Sun's going behind the clouds.

275
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:03,391
We lose the kid in half an hour.
Come on, let's go.

276
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:04,520
Wardrobe.

277
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:07,895
But of course, my dear. Help him
get rigid there, Harlene, will you?

278
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:10,191
Okay, come here, honey. Come to Momma.

279
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:13,864
Keep your meat hooks to yourself.
I can handle this on my own.

280
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:29,978
Look at that thing grow,
like money in the bank.

281
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:31,488
God, you're a pig, you know that?

282
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:35,822
- Yeah, you're a dog. Rex, the Wonder Dog!
- Okay, kiddies, okay.

283
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:39,619
All right, here's the scene.
Harlene, you are on the bed.

284
00:21:39,831 --> 00:21:42,823
Rex, you enter with the ascot.
You sit down, I want you to...

285
00:21:42,901 --> 00:21:46,393
touch it, fondle it, you know,
give me a little of that Dapper Dan stuff.

286
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:50,066
Right? Okay.
Now, Harlene, you look at him askance-

287
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,167
- Look at his what?
- Look at him...

288
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:58,372
You look at him askance. You look at him...

289
00:21:58,517 --> 00:22:00,951
Do you remember that...

290
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:03,510
horse opera you did for DeMille...

291
00:22:03,588 --> 00:22:06,318
when you looked at Bushman,
when he showed you his gun?

292
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:11,960
Yeah, I remember that. That was in '26.
When I gave them this?

293
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:17,869
Right. Plenty of that stuff. Okay, good.

294
00:22:17,936 --> 00:22:20,404
- Then you look down at his private parts-
- Private?

295
00:22:20,472 --> 00:22:23,703
- Don't make me laugh.
- Harlene, come on, will you? Come on.

296
00:22:23,775 --> 00:22:26,608
Now. Then you look up at his face
and you laugh.

297
00:22:26,978 --> 00:22:30,175
You laugh in his face. Very simple.
Okay? Ready?

298
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:32,909
All righty. Let's go for it.

299
00:22:32,984 --> 00:22:35,817
Hey, wait a minute.
Can't we have a run-through?

300
00:22:37,055 --> 00:22:40,183
Rex, what does it take to just sit there
and look stupid?

301
00:22:40,892 --> 00:22:44,521
- I'm warning you, zit-tits.
- Hey, Rex, let's go.

302
00:22:46,264 --> 00:22:49,165
Thank you. All righty.

303
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:51,900
Rex, you're out of frame here.

304
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:54,069
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry,
just a couple of seconds.

305
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:56,168
Please, I'd really
appreciate it.

306
00:22:56,241 --> 00:22:58,732
Thank you. Damn right of you. All righty.

307
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:03,679
We're rolling. And action.
Harlene, you're looking at him.

308
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,040
And enter Rex.

309
00:23:09,254 --> 00:23:11,950
Enter Rex. Walk.
There's nothing in the room.

310
00:23:12,023 --> 00:23:16,119
Walk with impunity. There we go.
And sit down, like a human being.

311
00:23:16,194 --> 00:23:19,493
Fair enough. I'll settle for that.
Okay, now.

312
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:25,659
Okay, Rex, anytime you're ready,
you can start earning your money.

313
00:23:27,105 --> 00:23:28,697
You mean the ascot?

314
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:32,369
Yes, Rex, touch the fucking ascot.

315
00:23:40,952 --> 00:23:44,581
And cut.

316
00:23:48,293 --> 00:23:51,592
Okay, moving right along-

317
00:23:52,397 --> 00:23:55,924
- Jesus Christ.
- Big Mac. Oh, boy, payday!

318
00:23:56,334 --> 00:23:59,929
Relax, that bucket thumb
never touched a doorbell in his life.

319
00:24:00,005 --> 00:24:02,269
He's probably just some bill collector.

320
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:06,242
Listen, Rex, do me a favor,
will you, pal? Give him the brush?

321
00:24:06,344 --> 00:24:09,507
- Give him the brush? Why me?
- Because you're in the buff, old sport.

322
00:24:09,581 --> 00:24:12,448
And besides, they know my face.
Now, come on, you just...

323
00:24:12,517 --> 00:24:16,351
Come on. You go to the door,
you tell them you're in the shower...

324
00:24:16,421 --> 00:24:20,949
you tell them you never heard of me,
and then you slam the door in his face.

325
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:24,520
Come on!

326
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:27,696
Kid's got a lot of talent.

327
00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:32,367
He sure takes it with him when he goes!

328
00:24:41,213 --> 00:24:42,771
Hey, listen, hon.

329
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:47,482
You got any ideas when the Big Boy
is really gonna show?

330
00:24:47,552 --> 00:24:51,420
Hang on, Harlene.
Big Mac's right around the corner.

331
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:54,417
The corners in this town
are pretty far apart.

332
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:59,089
Big Mac has a very big car,
with a trunk full of treasure.

333
00:25:00,031 --> 00:25:01,589
Who don't around here?

334
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:06,032
Remember that heap Wally used to drive?

335
00:25:06,104 --> 00:25:09,369
Remember that time he mooned that crowd
in front of Grauman's Chinese?

336
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:10,430
Gee, he was a crazy-

337
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:12,568
We weren't going to talk about
Wally anymore.

338
00:25:12,644 --> 00:25:16,307
I feel six kinds of a fool
but that's probably what you wanted.

339
00:25:16,381 --> 00:25:18,508
It wasn't a bill collector at all.

340
00:25:19,217 --> 00:25:21,515
Who was it? Fire marshal? Dogcatcher?

341
00:25:21,586 --> 00:25:23,816
I'm host to a lot of
public servants these days.

342
00:25:23,889 --> 00:25:26,824
It couldn't have been the dogcatcher.
He's still here.

343
00:25:26,892 --> 00:25:29,486
It was that new kid from Pathé.

344
00:25:29,561 --> 00:25:32,860
Said his name was Clark Gable.
Said he was looking for the Boy Wonder.

345
00:25:32,931 --> 00:25:34,364
- What'd you say?
- What you told me.

346
00:25:34,432 --> 00:25:38,300
Said I never heard of you, I just stepped
into the shower. He's a real wise guy.

347
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,998
- What'd he say?
- He said, "Just stepped into the shower?

348
00:25:41,072 --> 00:25:44,473
"Your neck would get a lot cleaner
if you took your ascot off next time."

349
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:48,172
Just like that, he says it,
then he winks and walks away. Wise guy.

350
00:25:48,346 --> 00:25:52,612
- What the hell does this kid want from me?
- I told you. He loves ghost stories.

351
00:25:52,951 --> 00:25:55,078
- That's rich.
- It's a scream.

352
00:25:55,153 --> 00:25:58,486
You think that's a scream?
Wanna hear a scream?

353
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:01,982
Just wait till you hear what bubbles
up out of your big mouth...

354
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,961
the next time that kid comes around here
bothering me again.

355
00:26:12,704 --> 00:26:17,641
Relax, kid. He won't be back. One look
at this kid's mug would keep anybody away.

356
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:21,200
My mug? Say, listen, sister,
with a kisser as crinkled as yours is...

357
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,645
I wouldn't be casting aspersions
on anybody's-

358
00:26:23,715 --> 00:26:25,182
Okay, break it up.

359
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:29,084
And get it up, Rex, we're ready to roll.
Back to your places.

360
00:26:44,302 --> 00:26:45,769
Are you ready, Rex?

361
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:52,470
- Is he ready? Boner-rama!
- You've got a filthy mouth.

362
00:26:52,877 --> 00:26:56,677
Yeah? It must have been what I was
chomping on in the scene we did yesterday.

363
00:26:56,748 --> 00:26:59,979
- I'm warning you-
- All right. Sit down, get in your place.

364
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:08,221
Okay, now. Rex, she has been...

365
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:13,420
laughing at you. Your manhood, and
I employ the term strictly ad referendum...

366
00:27:13,498 --> 00:27:16,899
- your manhood has been impugned.
- What are you talking about?

367
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:19,334
- He means I'm laughing at your cock.
- Oh, yeah?

368
00:27:19,404 --> 00:27:22,532
That and the ascot.
Yes, that pretty much sums it up. Now...

369
00:27:24,342 --> 00:27:28,073
the question is, Rex,
what do you do about it?

370
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:30,307
- Are you kidding?
- But that's what you don't do...

371
00:27:30,382 --> 00:27:35,376
old sport. Because, after all,
we are not some pack of degenerates...

372
00:27:35,787 --> 00:27:39,883
smearing some slime
we shot in some seedy motel room...

373
00:27:40,191 --> 00:27:42,921
across the stag-party screens of America.

374
00:27:44,195 --> 00:27:45,856
We are pioneers, Rex.

375
00:27:46,631 --> 00:27:50,692
We are pioneers in the neoplastic arts.

376
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:57,535
We are ever-searching for that excuse...

377
00:27:58,076 --> 00:28:02,740
to extend the boundaries...

378
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:07,641
of those arts beyond the limits of urgency.

379
00:28:08,486 --> 00:28:10,977
I, honest to God,
don't know what you're talking about.

380
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:19,895
Rex, I'm talking about poetry, subtlety.

381
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:23,700
Now stop and think for one second.

382
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:30,904
Why deliver a crude blow to her face...

383
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:37,270
when the means are at hand
for you to render your vengeance...

384
00:28:38,516 --> 00:28:42,543
through the very instrument
of your anguish?

385
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:48,749
The very vehicle of her ridicule?

386
00:28:50,995 --> 00:28:54,328
Rex, you with me?

387
00:28:55,266 --> 00:28:56,426
I don't think I got-

388
00:28:56,501 --> 00:29:00,096
The ascot, Rex. Strangle her
with the fucking ascot, you orangutan.

389
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,768
Say, that's pretty good.

390
00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:06,004
Thank you. I'm sorry
for calling you an orangutan.

391
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:08,568
- That's all right.
- Let's get this show on the road.

392
00:29:08,646 --> 00:29:13,106
All righty. We're going to take it
from where you're laughing at him, Harlene.

393
00:29:14,285 --> 00:29:16,947
And action!

394
00:29:18,723 --> 00:29:23,092
All right, she's laughing at you, Rex.
She's laughing. Let it build.

395
00:29:26,364 --> 00:29:29,162
Think about it, Rex,
because she's laughing at you, boy.

396
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:32,533
She's laughing at every able-bodied
jack-buck of a man...

397
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:36,973
who paid his 25 cents to see this picture,
boy. What are you going to do about it?

398
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:39,768
First thought you're going to get...

399
00:29:39,844 --> 00:29:41,926
is you wanna drive that
sneering, little nose

400
00:29:41,927 --> 00:29:44,008
of hers up into that
empty, little brain.

401
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:46,915
Isn't it, boy? Go ahead, do it.

402
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:50,114
Do it! Feels good, doesn't it?

403
00:29:50,188 --> 00:29:55,091
You're going to smash her face, aren't you?
But wait, you've got a better idea.

404
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:59,791
The ascot!

405
00:29:59,864 --> 00:30:04,233
It's too beautiful.
That's it, take it off slowly, Rex.

406
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:07,829
Take it off slow. That's it, savor it.

407
00:30:07,906 --> 00:30:09,032
Beautiful.

408
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:13,436
Beautiful. Now just let it hang there.

409
00:30:13,611 --> 00:30:18,412
Let it hang there.
That's it, really nice, Rexy. Nice.

410
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:22,943
Like it's that old stocking
peeling off that little leg of hers.

411
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:26,252
Beautiful, Rex, beautiful.
Now let it hang there limp.

412
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:31,023
Let it hang there like a limp
and useless sleeping little snake.

413
00:30:31,095 --> 00:30:35,088
That's it. And now we're going to flick it,
flick it in her fucking face.

414
00:30:36,467 --> 00:30:37,832
Feels good, doesn't it?

415
00:30:38,703 --> 00:30:42,662
She's laughing at you, Rex.
How funny does she think it is now?

416
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:47,270
Your tits hurt? How funny is it now?

417
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:52,443
Now we're going to wrap it
around her throat.

418
00:30:52,584 --> 00:30:56,486
Now we're going to put it
around that soft white neck.

419
00:30:56,588 --> 00:30:59,648
Slowly, Rex, slowly. That's it.

420
00:30:59,724 --> 00:31:03,888
Beautiful, Rex, beautiful.
Put it around that little...

421
00:31:03,962 --> 00:31:06,487
lying, twisting throat of hers.

422
00:31:06,998 --> 00:31:08,693
You stay put!

423
00:31:10,668 --> 00:31:13,296
Tighter. I want it tighter!

424
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:16,238
I want to feel those veins popping...

425
00:31:16,307 --> 00:31:19,333
and those little bones crushed.

426
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:22,004
That's it! And now...

427
00:31:22,614 --> 00:31:25,378
show her who's boss, Rexy!

428
00:31:25,783 --> 00:31:27,216
Push her!

429
00:31:27,785 --> 00:31:32,586
There we go! Okay! That's the way!
That's it.

430
00:31:32,657 --> 00:31:36,184
There we go! Fuck her from behind.

431
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:42,166
There we go! Do it to her!

432
00:31:44,369 --> 00:31:49,102
That's it, there we go!
That's it! Fuck her!

433
00:31:52,844 --> 00:31:55,142
That's the stuff!

434
00:31:55,513 --> 00:31:58,175
Get him! Yeah, that's the way!

435
00:31:58,549 --> 00:32:02,246
Move, move, move!

436
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,719
Son of a bitch!

437
00:32:03,788 --> 00:32:04,777
Do it to her!

438
00:32:07,358 --> 00:32:10,122
Okay! All right! Thank you!

439
00:32:17,068 --> 00:32:20,037
There we go! Do it to her!

440
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:21,969
Fuck her! Fuck her ass!

441
00:32:25,043 --> 00:32:27,841
All right, now, fuck her.

442
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,470
Son of a bitch.

443
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:34,574
Get off!

444
00:32:38,556 --> 00:32:40,319
That's right!

445
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:43,691
All right!

446
00:32:47,565 --> 00:32:49,294
You son of a bitch.

447
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:13,056
You were at your peak, you know that?
You were at your goddamn peak.

448
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:15,318
- You're kidding.
- I'm not kidding you.

449
00:33:15,393 --> 00:33:18,362
That's it, that was your peak, wild bull.

450
00:33:20,131 --> 00:33:24,158
You're nuts. You're both nuts.
This is an insane asylum!

451
00:33:24,936 --> 00:33:26,631
Will you listen to this?

452
00:33:27,872 --> 00:33:31,706
Gets his twitching little fingers up over
the grave of his own star potential...

453
00:33:31,776 --> 00:33:34,040
and he's already shoving the mud back
down on us...

454
00:33:34,112 --> 00:33:36,080
with those muddy little knees of his.

455
00:33:36,147 --> 00:33:38,445
- You whining ingrate.
- Whining?

456
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:41,383
He's howling, he's Rex, the Wonder Dog.

457
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:45,986
I've had it with you two.
I don't need this humiliation.

458
00:33:46,057 --> 00:33:47,820
I got star potential.

459
00:33:48,426 --> 00:33:50,326
But, Rex, old sport...

460
00:33:50,461 --> 00:33:52,861
that is what they call
your classic combination.

461
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:56,798
I call it the bunk 'cause I met someone
today who's taken an interest in my work.

462
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:59,336
Someone who's very sweet.
He's a big cheese at Metro...

463
00:33:59,404 --> 00:34:02,532
- and when Big Mac comes-
- He's going to come quietly...

464
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:06,032
so as not to disturb the Boy Wonder here.

465
00:34:08,513 --> 00:34:13,473
So, did I tell you or what?
You get used to it.

466
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:17,414
It's no great shakes, believe me.

467
00:34:17,955 --> 00:34:21,618
Ten minutes and you'll wish
they put some clothes on.

468
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:25,718
I'm not complaining. I want to see it all.

469
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:33,629
- Is that him?
- Yeah.

470
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:37,930
Oh, gee, Mac, I'm so glad to see you.

471
00:34:38,009 --> 00:34:40,273
Did you bring me my little something?

472
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:44,245
Gonna play guess? You tell me now,
am I hot or cold?

473
00:34:44,315 --> 00:34:48,012
Nix, honey. I'm gone on this kid.

474
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:51,714
Gee, I guess so.

475
00:34:51,789 --> 00:34:55,156
How about mine? I mean,
God knows I earned it, you know.

476
00:34:56,260 --> 00:35:00,094
- You earned it? Put your pants on first.
- Hey, come on.

477
00:35:00,631 --> 00:35:05,125
Suit yourself. You get used to it. 10
minutes, you'll wish he put his pants on.

478
00:35:05,203 --> 00:35:07,603
I'll put my pants on for you.
I just want my dough.

479
00:35:07,672 --> 00:35:08,696
Here.

480
00:35:09,574 --> 00:35:13,032
Anybody would think you need it worse
than she needs that hooch.

481
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:16,911
I'm surprised I don't need that stuff,
working in this insane asylum.

482
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:21,717
- Pipes still on the fritz?
- What do you think? Use the pool.

483
00:35:22,587 --> 00:35:24,680
My God.

484
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:27,448
Geez.

485
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:35,199
Hey, how about going
a little slow on that stuff?

486
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:38,830
I'm getting all goofy
inside, it'll be okay.

487
00:35:39,103 --> 00:35:42,766
We got a whole finish, you know.
A lot of inserts to do.

488
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:46,305
Hey, what are inserts?
Does that mean, you know what?

489
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:50,178
Yeah, I guess. Ask him.

490
00:35:50,681 --> 00:35:54,777
- We haven't been introduced.
- Introduced?

491
00:35:56,554 --> 00:36:01,423
This is the Boy Wonder. This is Miss Cake.
My fiancée maybe.

492
00:36:01,792 --> 00:36:03,953
She wants to know what are inserts.

493
00:36:04,362 --> 00:36:07,854
Inserts are what we're not going
to get done...

494
00:36:07,932 --> 00:36:10,230
as long as you're hanging around here.

495
00:36:10,701 --> 00:36:13,602
- Careful there, bub.
- Oh, well, for God's sake.

496
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:18,335
You just handed her enough of that dust
to make a rhino do a Rip van Winkle.

497
00:36:18,409 --> 00:36:21,572
And you know damn well that Rex
is all downhill from his pay packet.

498
00:36:21,646 --> 00:36:24,206
I wouldn't be surprised
if he took a powder altogether...

499
00:36:24,282 --> 00:36:26,750
now that he's got that lettuce
in his hot little hand.

500
00:36:26,817 --> 00:36:28,910
So let him! You can get new.

501
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:31,253
What the hell do you mean get new?

502
00:36:31,322 --> 00:36:33,381
How about the kid we just saw leaving?

503
00:36:33,457 --> 00:36:36,324
- This new kid or whatever?
- Pathé, Clark Gable.

504
00:36:36,427 --> 00:36:39,521
That's the goof. Ain't she cute?
She wants to be in the movies.

505
00:36:40,231 --> 00:36:41,858
Know anyone that don't?

506
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:46,765
Listen. I've got half this sperm-jerker
in the can, you know?

507
00:36:47,104 --> 00:36:50,073
If he takes a powder,
I've got to start from scratch.

508
00:36:50,174 --> 00:36:53,200
If what we just seen you doing
is what you got in the can...

509
00:36:53,277 --> 00:36:56,303
then maybe starting from scratch
ain't such a bad idea.

510
00:36:56,380 --> 00:37:00,146
What's the idea of taking the camera
off the stand?

511
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:01,446
It's a tripod, isn't it?

512
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:03,402
Yeah, that's it. The tripod.
What's the idea of that?

513
00:37:03,403 --> 00:37:05,285
How's that gonna look?

514
00:37:05,356 --> 00:37:09,725
It is not going to look,
it is going to be looked at.

515
00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:11,895
Don't tell me how to make movies.

516
00:37:11,963 --> 00:37:15,262
And don't you tell me not to
tell you how to spend my money.

517
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,828
What's that gonna look like?

518
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:20,530
Who's gonna pay two bits to look at
something that makes his eyeballs bounce?

519
00:37:20,605 --> 00:37:23,665
Listen, my friend, the syphilitic
perverts that are going...

520
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:26,972
to spend money to see this film
don't even know they have eyeballs.

521
00:37:27,044 --> 00:37:29,325
Yeah, how come you're
always pulling this

522
00:37:29,326 --> 00:37:31,606
stuff with taking the
camera off the stand...

523
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:35,344
and writing these bone-ass scripts,
and taking pictures from the ceiling...

524
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:38,115
and from under the bed,
and from between people's legs?

525
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:40,953
And all that other fancy crap
that nobody else does?

526
00:37:53,371 --> 00:37:57,671
I swear you do it just to rile me,
pure and simple.

527
00:37:59,844 --> 00:38:02,369
Nothing pure, old sport, is ever simple.

528
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:09,715
- Loaded up and ready to go.
- Harlene, you don't need that.

529
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:12,984
I mean you don't need that much.

530
00:38:13,257 --> 00:38:17,853
Come on now, honey. You better turn out
them lights. The bulbs are gonna burn out.

531
00:38:18,596 --> 00:38:21,292
- You seen my lucky necktie?
- Hey.

532
00:38:22,566 --> 00:38:25,296
Don't you just jab that stuff
in front of Miss Cake here.

533
00:38:25,369 --> 00:38:27,803
- Oh, really, Mac.
- No soap! It's degenerate.

534
00:38:27,872 --> 00:38:29,396
I don't want her to look at it.

535
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:33,034
- You gave her the stuff.
- What do you mean, "gave"? She earned it.

536
00:38:33,377 --> 00:38:35,538
Now come on, honey,
elsewhere with that stuff.

537
00:38:35,613 --> 00:38:37,979
Yeah, well, I'm trying to find
my lucky necktie.

538
00:38:38,049 --> 00:38:40,313
Mac, I told you, I want to see it all.

539
00:38:40,418 --> 00:38:43,979
Well, this ain't part of it,
this ain't part of nothing. Come on.

540
00:38:47,858 --> 00:38:51,817
Come here.
We were doing okay, weren't we?

541
00:38:52,063 --> 00:38:54,896
Okay? We were doing swell.

542
00:38:54,965 --> 00:38:56,990
What the hell do you
need all that stuff for?

543
00:38:57,068 --> 00:38:58,865
Now don't start this stuff.

544
00:38:59,236 --> 00:39:00,794
I ain't got your imagination.

545
00:39:00,871 --> 00:39:04,830
- Harlene, when are you going to learn?
- You're the one that's got to learn.

546
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:09,369
You got to learn not to start this stuff.
I ain't got your imagination.

547
00:39:11,282 --> 00:39:14,183
I just get kind of tired, need a shot.
That's all.

548
00:39:14,552 --> 00:39:19,455
I'll be back with you in a minute.
I just need a shot, that's all.

549
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:24,890
Hell, I ain't gonna find
that lucky necktie.

550
00:39:24,962 --> 00:39:27,897
Harlene, wait a second.

551
00:39:27,965 --> 00:39:30,263
Look, I can get rid of them.

552
00:39:30,334 --> 00:39:32,802
Don't do that. I need an audience...

553
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,770
- lots of times.
- No, you don't.

554
00:39:35,473 --> 00:39:37,031
Sure I do.

555
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:40,809
You don't.

556
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:46,149
That's how come you don't know
how bad I need a shot.

557
00:39:46,951 --> 00:39:50,216
- Harlene.
- Hey.

558
00:39:51,689 --> 00:39:55,557
You better turn off them lights.
The bulbs are gonna burn out.

559
00:40:07,638 --> 00:40:09,435
Smart cookie.

560
00:40:10,174 --> 00:40:12,335
I like a dame who saves me dough.

561
00:40:13,811 --> 00:40:15,176
You know...

562
00:40:17,548 --> 00:40:20,676
I ought to take her
out of that owl wagon she slings in.

563
00:40:27,124 --> 00:40:29,217
Stick her in one of my joints.

564
00:40:30,628 --> 00:40:32,528
If only she wasn't a hophead.

565
00:40:33,831 --> 00:40:36,800
Gee, she's a lot smaller than
she looks in the movies.

566
00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:40,299
What's this? Where'd you see her
in the movies?

567
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:42,937
Back in Chicago, same as everybody.

568
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:47,367
The real movies, silly. When
she used to be in the real movies, not-

569
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:49,841
You mean the real movies?

570
00:40:51,081 --> 00:40:54,710
Can you beat that? I thought you meant
you'd seen... Can you beat that?

571
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:57,948
What would be so terrible
if I had seen what you thought I meant?

572
00:40:58,022 --> 00:41:00,855
Listen, if I ever catch you
hanging around the chip houses...

573
00:41:00,991 --> 00:41:04,154
- where they put this load of junk-
- You treat me like a child.

574
00:41:04,228 --> 00:41:06,389
You're the one that calls me Daddy.

575
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:09,698
Is this kid a sketch or what?

576
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:14,335
Come on, honey. I only kid you
'cause I go for you so.

577
00:41:14,405 --> 00:41:16,430
- Here's a thought, Mac.
- What's that?

578
00:41:16,507 --> 00:41:20,034
You going and take her with you.

579
00:41:21,412 --> 00:41:23,403
You watch your step, there, bub.

580
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:25,972
I don't care what this whosits
from Pathé says...

581
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:27,813
you're skating on thin ice with me.

582
00:41:27,885 --> 00:41:29,147
What who said?

583
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:33,820
Don't your neighbors ever say anything
about that swimming pool back there?

584
00:41:33,891 --> 00:41:37,258
What neighbors?
He's the only one left on this block.

585
00:41:37,394 --> 00:41:40,386
Ain't you heard?
They're gonna run a whatsits through here.

586
00:41:40,464 --> 00:41:43,058
- A road. A fast-way.
- Freeways, they call them.

587
00:41:43,267 --> 00:41:45,064
Yeah, that's it. Freeways.

588
00:41:45,135 --> 00:41:47,501
Smart Boy could've been into
some of the big bucks...

589
00:41:47,638 --> 00:41:49,196
if he had scribbled his chits right.

590
00:41:49,406 --> 00:41:52,739
Anybody with a yolk in his egg
has his dough tied up in these freeways.

591
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:55,438
I'm good for about $50,000.

592
00:41:55,779 --> 00:41:59,806
Land? Buy cheap and sell big?
You're pretty smart, Big Mac.

593
00:41:59,884 --> 00:42:03,980
Land's strictly small-time.
The real dough's in hamburgers.

594
00:42:04,054 --> 00:42:05,248
Hamburgers?

595
00:42:09,226 --> 00:42:14,163
Say, he's okay. What can he do about it?

596
00:42:14,431 --> 00:42:17,594
This is a million-dollar idea
and he ain't got jack-shit.

597
00:42:19,136 --> 00:42:21,195
Pardon my French.

598
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:24,467
Now here's the deal, you
got a lot of these...

599
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:27,943
whatsits, these freeways.
You got a lot of cars on them, right?

600
00:42:28,012 --> 00:42:30,879
You got a lot of cars,
you got a lot of hungry rubes in them.

601
00:42:30,948 --> 00:42:32,040
Yeah, sure.

602
00:42:32,116 --> 00:42:34,414
Well, there you go, kiddo.
It's as simple as that.

603
00:42:34,485 --> 00:42:38,319
I'm gonna build me a mess of hamburger
stands and a mess of gas stations.

604
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:42,485
But here's your angle,
I'm gonna build them exactly alike.

605
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,393
I'll run them up one side of the road
and down the other...

606
00:42:45,462 --> 00:42:47,657
and they're all gonna look exactly alike.

607
00:42:47,865 --> 00:42:51,323
So your cruising rube don't know what
he's getting when he pulls in, see?

608
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:54,530
He don't know from gas,
he don't know from hamburgers...

609
00:42:54,939 --> 00:42:58,340
he don't gotta think about nothing.
He's just got to eat.

610
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:04,444
Yeah, but what if he pulls
into a gas station, you know?

611
00:43:09,453 --> 00:43:11,614
That's what I'm talking
about, here, buster.

612
00:43:11,689 --> 00:43:14,487
If you don't get them coming,
you get them going.

613
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:18,452
Pretty soon, they're just gonna wind down
the windows...

614
00:43:18,529 --> 00:43:21,430
and throw out the dough,
without even stopping the car.

615
00:43:22,833 --> 00:43:27,133
Freeways, what a gimmick! If these
freeways don't end the Depression...

616
00:43:27,204 --> 00:43:28,831
nothing will.

617
00:43:29,974 --> 00:43:33,910
Come on, relax. It's okay.

618
00:43:33,978 --> 00:43:35,570
He ain't got jack-shit.

619
00:43:36,547 --> 00:43:38,447
Well, maybe not...

620
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:42,411
- but I do have a few ideas of my own.
- That so?

621
00:43:43,854 --> 00:43:47,221
I had an idea this morning,
an idea for this picture.

622
00:43:47,691 --> 00:43:51,889
What's that, taking the camera
off the stand? You thought of that?

623
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:53,691
No, sir. Nothing like that.

624
00:43:54,865 --> 00:43:57,265
It's a little stunt I do with my shorts.

625
00:43:59,269 --> 00:44:03,137
I suck my stomach in, see?
And then pull my shorts up tight...

626
00:44:03,207 --> 00:44:06,005
way up past my waist...

627
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:10,444
and then, when I'm ready, pow,
I slam it up there and it rips them.

628
00:44:10,514 --> 00:44:13,608
It rips them right up the middle.
You get it?

629
00:44:18,088 --> 00:44:22,149
I kind of like that.
That's kind of a cute stunt, yeah?

630
00:44:23,127 --> 00:44:27,587
- I told you Big Mac would go for it.
- You didn't have to.

631
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:31,032
If you knew I'd go for it,
why didn't you put it in the picture?

632
00:44:31,101 --> 00:44:36,038
Oh, Christ. Two rhetorical questions
in one day. Am I turning into rubber?

633
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:39,676
What's this rubber stuff?
What's this rhetorical questions?

634
00:44:40,244 --> 00:44:43,111
Your whole life is a rhetorical question.

635
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,214
- What is this stuff?
- It's smart guy stuff.

636
00:44:45,282 --> 00:44:47,512
- He used the same gag on me.
- Yeah?

637
00:44:48,285 --> 00:44:52,312
Well, listen, smart guy, and this is
no gag, you're treading on thin ice.

638
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:54,320
And you're wasting my time.

639
00:44:54,658 --> 00:44:57,593
I'm trying to get rid of this orangutan
by 4:00.

640
00:44:58,062 --> 00:44:59,222
What's this?

641
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:03,529
- I met someone today.
- Yeah?

642
00:45:03,934 --> 00:45:07,961
Yeah, well, I'm supposed to meet him
at the Beverly Hills Hotel by 4:00.

643
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:12,871
He said, well, you know,
I had star potential.

644
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:21,179
The guy a Kraut? Big cheese at Metro?
Taco chauffeur?

645
00:45:26,256 --> 00:45:29,487
I know about that gag
and I ain't even in the real movies.

646
00:45:29,793 --> 00:45:31,124
Who is it?

647
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:36,188
So I'd appreciate it, Mac, old sport, if
you'd just shake wallets and say goodbye.

648
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,665
Appreciate? Now that's a funny word
coming from you, kid.

649
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:42,797
- I don't have time for this, Mac.
- You don't have time?

650
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:48,443
Will you listen to this kid?
He still thinks he's the Boy Wonder.

651
00:45:48,779 --> 00:45:53,682
He still thinks he's got somewhere to go.
Buddy, all you got is time...

652
00:45:54,051 --> 00:45:55,643
and I'm paying for it.

653
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:04,159
Now, let's see this stunt with the shorts.

654
00:46:04,228 --> 00:46:07,129
- You mean it?
- Yeah, sure, sounds like a hot one.

655
00:46:07,397 --> 00:46:10,025
- Let's take pictures.
- Swell, only we need the girl.

656
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:13,467
It's better to get a shot of the girl
going bananas just after I do it.

657
00:46:13,537 --> 00:46:15,835
- Okay, go get her.
- Say, I'll go.

658
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:20,406
I told you, honey, nix on that stuff.
Go get her, Rex.

659
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:22,078
You bet!

660
00:46:25,549 --> 00:46:29,542
Funny bit. The guy's a hot one.

661
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:33,112
Could the same guy who'd fall
for that Beverly Hills Hotel gag...

662
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:35,158
come up with the stunt with the shorts?

663
00:46:35,225 --> 00:46:37,716
- I'm not going to do it, Mac.
- What's this?

664
00:46:38,862 --> 00:46:42,798
I said I'm not going to do it.
And neither is Harlene.

665
00:46:44,201 --> 00:46:47,261
- Listen, bub-
- Hey, this kid's dead.

666
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:50,038
- What do you mean?
- I mean she's dead...

667
00:46:50,107 --> 00:46:53,804
over the rope, too much dust.
The needle's still in her arm.

668
00:46:54,611 --> 00:46:56,408
She's dead, I tell you.

669
00:46:57,981 --> 00:47:00,472
I told you she wasn't going to do it, Mac.

670
00:47:15,966 --> 00:47:18,025
And I'm not going to do it, either.

671
00:47:32,282 --> 00:47:36,742
Well, maybe she ain't really stiff.

672
00:47:37,421 --> 00:47:39,219
Maybe she's-

673
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:41,016
- She's stiff all right.
I'm in the business.

674
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:49,397
- I'm getting out of this insane asylum.
- Hold your horses there, buster.

675
00:47:49,833 --> 00:47:52,734
Look, this is not my problem.
You gave her that stuff.

676
00:47:52,803 --> 00:47:55,294
Will you people
quit making with the "gave"?

677
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:59,870
She earned every grain of that stuff,
and it was good stuff, too.

678
00:48:00,978 --> 00:48:04,141
You people make her out like a panhandler,
and me a cheese-ass.

679
00:48:04,615 --> 00:48:07,880
I don't gyp nobody,
and I don't give handouts.

680
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:12,314
I'll hand her that, she's
a good little worker.

681
00:48:12,823 --> 00:48:15,917
- Was a good little worker.
- Was is right...

682
00:48:15,993 --> 00:48:18,518
'cause now she's dead.
You got to do something about it.

683
00:48:18,595 --> 00:48:22,463
Now listen. Will you just wait a minute?
Don't go flying off the handle.

684
00:48:23,533 --> 00:48:25,728
We've got to think about this logically.

685
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:30,137
- She's up there dead, right?
- And you've got to do something about it.

686
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:33,108
How do you figure that, bub?
I mean, look at it this way.

687
00:48:33,176 --> 00:48:36,339
It's the Boy Wonder's bed
she's sitting on up there getting stiff...

688
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:38,779
with that spike growing out of her arm.

689
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:42,214
You know, that's a funny thing.

690
00:48:43,687 --> 00:48:46,155
When it comes to taking a camera
off the stand...

691
00:48:46,223 --> 00:48:48,885
or deciding about doing
a stunt with the shorts...

692
00:48:48,959 --> 00:48:50,893
it's all up to the Boy Wonder there.

693
00:48:50,961 --> 00:48:53,395
Whatever the Boy Wonder says, goes.

694
00:48:54,631 --> 00:48:56,724
But the minute you got a stiff...

695
00:48:57,734 --> 00:49:00,066
it all falls on the Big Boy.

696
00:49:01,838 --> 00:49:04,170
It all falls on Mister Money.

697
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:08,073
That's kind of a funny thing,
don't you think?

698
00:49:09,379 --> 00:49:11,313
What do you think, Wonder Boy?

699
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:14,649
What are you sitting there
so quiet thinking about?

700
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:21,484
- Wally Reid.
- Gosh, did you know Wallace Reid?

701
00:49:25,662 --> 00:49:29,996
The day Wally Reid died, I was having lunch
with Griffith, Gish, and Hayes.

702
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:34,362
Somebody came in
and told us what happened...

703
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:39,572
and Gish started crying right away.

704
00:49:41,211 --> 00:49:44,476
She said, "Poor Wally...

705
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:48,383
"poor Wally, what am I going to do now?"

706
00:49:50,587 --> 00:49:53,283
Had to leave the table,
she was crying so hard.

707
00:49:55,025 --> 00:49:58,961
Old Will Hayes, of course,
got up to go after her.

708
00:50:01,131 --> 00:50:03,395
She used to bring that out in people.

709
00:50:05,569 --> 00:50:07,696
And as he left, he turned to us...

710
00:50:08,472 --> 00:50:11,100
and he shot this out like spit, he said:

711
00:50:12,309 --> 00:50:16,609
"Good riddance!
Good riddance to bad rubbish!"

712
00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:21,777
After they were gone...

713
00:50:25,122 --> 00:50:28,990
Griffith turned to me and he was smiling.

714
00:50:30,794 --> 00:50:34,230
I never saw that son of a gun
look so happy in my life.

715
00:50:36,333 --> 00:50:38,062
Do you know what he said?

716
00:50:39,569 --> 00:50:43,198
He said, "God bless him.

717
00:50:46,309 --> 00:50:50,541
"God bless that poor son of a bitch
for not dying in the middle of my picture."

718
00:50:52,649 --> 00:50:54,742
And then he ate Lillian's dessert.

719
00:50:57,621 --> 00:51:00,112
That's a real cute little story...

720
00:51:00,657 --> 00:51:03,023
but it don't exactly solve the problem.

721
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:06,021
What would you like me to say?

722
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:13,635
I've got half a film in the can,
and my leading lady has gone over the rope.

723
00:51:14,871 --> 00:51:19,808
I have asked you before not to come
around here when I was shooting.

724
00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:23,408
That still don't solve the problem, kiddo.

725
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:26,540
Maybe there isn't a problem.

726
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:28,578
Let me think.

727
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:39,695
- Maybe we can shoot around it.
- Shoot around it?

728
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:42,398
You can't shoot around this,
somebody's dead up there.

729
00:51:42,466 --> 00:51:46,459
So are you when somebody points a camera
at you. Maybe we can do it all in close.

730
00:51:46,536 --> 00:51:48,333
Do what in close, for the love of God?

731
00:51:48,405 --> 00:51:52,398
Will you be quiet five minutes?

732
00:51:52,909 --> 00:51:54,433
Let me think!

733
00:52:00,317 --> 00:52:03,081
Now, it's not the way I wanted to do it.

734
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:08,521
It's pretty stock stuff, him grabbing her
by the handles...

735
00:52:08,925 --> 00:52:12,383
a couple of come shots.
Give Rex more to do, God forbid.

736
00:52:12,729 --> 00:52:17,132
Rewrite the ending. I can finish this film.
Let's get Harlene's body back in here.

737
00:52:17,234 --> 00:52:19,600
Are you crazy?

738
00:52:20,871 --> 00:52:25,035
He's out of his noodle.
Right out of his fucking noodle.

739
00:52:25,175 --> 00:52:26,938
Pardon my French.

740
00:52:28,245 --> 00:52:32,841
You want me to do it with a stiff?

741
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:35,174
Who's gonna know?

742
00:52:35,519 --> 00:52:39,011
- Oh, God, I think I'm going to be sick.
- The pool, Rex, use the pool.

743
00:52:39,089 --> 00:52:41,319
I've warned you before,
I've got dishes in the sink.

744
00:52:41,391 --> 00:52:45,157
I got a name in the funeral business.
If word ever got out...

745
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:49,757
Unwind. He's just pulling your leg.

746
00:52:52,035 --> 00:52:56,131
- Aren't you?
- It doesn't look like it to me.

747
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:58,571
You really want him
to do it with a stiff?

748
00:52:58,572 --> 00:53:00,636
We got a six-picture
contract, don't we?

749
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:03,076
You want this fucking movie or don't you?

750
00:53:05,782 --> 00:53:07,647
You're out of your noodle!

751
00:53:08,752 --> 00:53:11,846
Right straight out of your noodle.

752
00:53:12,556 --> 00:53:14,421
I'm through. I'm getting out of here.

753
00:53:14,491 --> 00:53:17,517
I should've quit when you
hit me over the head with that bottle.

754
00:53:17,594 --> 00:53:20,529
Hang on. You just gave me an idea there.

755
00:53:20,597 --> 00:53:24,033
Don't wanna hear any more of your ideas.
I just want to get out of here.

756
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:26,660
I'm supposed
to be at the Beverly Hills Hotel by 4:00.

757
00:53:26,736 --> 00:53:29,102
Gee, Rex, that's too bad...

758
00:53:29,172 --> 00:53:32,403
'cause I listened to your idea,
and I thought it was a good one, too.

759
00:53:32,475 --> 00:53:33,874
That stunt with the shorts...

760
00:53:33,944 --> 00:53:37,402
that's just the kind of thinking I
could fit into my hamburger operation.

761
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:40,449
I'm not interested
in your hamburger operation.

762
00:53:40,517 --> 00:53:41,506
No?

763
00:53:41,918 --> 00:53:45,854
Gee, kid, that's too bad.
You wanna know why?

764
00:53:46,122 --> 00:53:50,149
That hamburger operation ain't the only pie
I'm thinking of sticking my thumb in.

765
00:53:50,227 --> 00:53:52,855
No, sir, not by a long shot.

766
00:53:52,929 --> 00:53:55,796
I've been thinking a lot
about the real movies, too.

767
00:53:55,966 --> 00:53:57,126
Real movies?

768
00:53:57,467 --> 00:54:00,834
It probably wouldn't interest you.

769
00:54:01,104 --> 00:54:03,971
No, what about them?

770
00:54:04,574 --> 00:54:08,476
It's just I've been thinking...
No, forget it.

771
00:54:08,979 --> 00:54:13,541
You're going to the Beverly Hills Hotel
and you're meeting a big cheese from Metro.

772
00:54:13,883 --> 00:54:18,718
That's okay. I mean, I got a
couple minutes. Go ahead.

773
00:54:19,389 --> 00:54:23,382
It's just I been thinking...

774
00:54:23,893 --> 00:54:26,384
these stag pics is okay for your...

775
00:54:26,463 --> 00:54:30,399
nickel-and-dime motor-court crowd,
you know what I mean? Funny.

776
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:34,330
I've been thinking, maybe it's time
I got into the real movies...

777
00:54:34,404 --> 00:54:36,269
and made some real dough. Yeah.

778
00:54:36,339 --> 00:54:38,136
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

779
00:54:38,875 --> 00:54:42,868
Miss Cake and I have been talking about it
for a long time.

780
00:54:45,982 --> 00:54:50,351
And I think she'd be pretty hot stuff
up there, with a little practice.

781
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:53,081
Yes, sir, pretty hot stuff.

782
00:54:53,923 --> 00:54:56,915
But the thing is, we need a guy...

783
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:59,790
to kind of run things for us,
you know what I mean?

784
00:54:59,863 --> 00:55:03,629
The kind of guy that knows
one end of picture from the other.

785
00:55:05,035 --> 00:55:06,366
Well...

786
00:55:07,604 --> 00:55:09,629
I've had a lot of experience.

787
00:55:09,706 --> 00:55:12,334
I know, Rex, that's what I was thinking.

788
00:55:12,676 --> 00:55:15,144
And you're a good little worker,
I'll hand you that.

789
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:21,211
But the thing is, could we count on
you when the chips was down?

790
00:55:21,551 --> 00:55:23,644
You can count on me, Big Mac.

791
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:26,414
Could we? I mean...

792
00:55:26,756 --> 00:55:28,781
right here's your case in point.

793
00:55:29,292 --> 00:55:31,817
Here I am, with a stiff
in the other room...

794
00:55:31,895 --> 00:55:35,558
and you're on your way
to the Beverly Hills Hotel, Rex.

795
00:55:35,932 --> 00:55:38,492
Gee, Mac, you make it sound like I was a-

796
00:55:38,568 --> 00:55:40,092
Chicken-shit pansy-ass?

797
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:42,900
What can I do?
You know I'd help you if I could.

798
00:55:42,972 --> 00:55:45,202
But you can, buster, you can.

799
00:55:45,475 --> 00:55:48,501
You just said it a minute ago,
you got a name.

800
00:55:50,146 --> 00:55:51,738
I got a stiff...

801
00:55:51,981 --> 00:55:55,041
and you're in the funeral biz!

802
00:55:59,255 --> 00:56:01,689
Don't that say something to you?

803
00:56:05,295 --> 00:56:08,662
I got it. You want a discount.

804
00:56:08,765 --> 00:56:10,630
Yeah, I can get you one.

805
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:13,794
Discount? What is this kid using for steam?

806
00:56:14,637 --> 00:56:19,472
What are you talking, "discount"? You
think I'll advertise in the social pages?

807
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:21,973
You think I'm gonna get six pallbearers...

808
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:24,707
five for the box
and one for the spike in her arm?

809
00:56:24,781 --> 00:56:28,683
I want you should do it on the q.
t., stupid.

810
00:56:28,752 --> 00:56:30,947
You mean don't tell anybody?

811
00:56:31,187 --> 00:56:32,518
I mean...

812
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:35,190
you and me...

813
00:56:36,493 --> 00:56:37,824
right now...

814
00:56:41,264 --> 00:56:43,232
we dump her in the car...

815
00:56:43,299 --> 00:56:46,166
and we take her out to the maggot ranch...

816
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:48,568
and we stick her in a spare hole.

817
00:56:48,638 --> 00:56:49,662
Spare hole?

818
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:53,971
Come on now, buster. We're talking
about one of your top boneyards here.

819
00:56:54,043 --> 00:56:57,171
- Don't tell me they don't book in advance.
- They book in advance.

820
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:01,376
Then you must have something
warming up for somebody, yeah?

821
00:57:02,952 --> 00:57:05,045
We are expecting a party of two tomorrow.

822
00:57:05,121 --> 00:57:08,147
A lovebird thing.
Guy shot his wife, then sucked a pipe...

823
00:57:08,224 --> 00:57:10,215
and left an order for a double ditch.

824
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:14,018
A double ditch? There you go.

825
00:57:14,631 --> 00:57:16,758
Plenty of room for everybody.

826
00:57:17,133 --> 00:57:20,193
We stick her in there today.
Brush a little dust on her...

827
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:22,568
and then tomorrow,
when they lower the crates-

828
00:57:22,639 --> 00:57:24,664
I don't know, I mean wait a minute.

829
00:57:24,741 --> 00:57:28,871
I mean, you make it sound real easy.
I mean, what if somebody saw us?

830
00:57:28,945 --> 00:57:32,381
I mean, I got a name,
a name in the funeral business.

831
00:57:32,782 --> 00:57:34,409
All right, Rex...

832
00:57:40,390 --> 00:57:42,915
if it means more to you...

833
00:57:43,893 --> 00:57:48,023
than a name in the real movies, forget it.

834
00:57:48,097 --> 00:57:49,997
Now, wait a minute.

835
00:57:52,769 --> 00:57:54,566
I guess...

836
00:57:55,338 --> 00:57:59,069
we could hide her in the shed
where I keep my shovel.

837
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:02,039
Now you're cooking.

838
00:58:02,212 --> 00:58:06,672
And then I could go back tonight
when it was dark and bury her.

839
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:10,051
Why, sure. It's a cinch.

840
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:12,415
- Come on, let's go.
- Well, now-

841
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:15,788
- Come on.
- I'm coming.

842
00:58:40,884 --> 00:58:44,479
So you knew Wallace Reid?

843
00:59:04,908 --> 00:59:06,933
Careful there, will you?

844
00:59:08,611 --> 00:59:12,172
Wait a minute. What if someone sees us
putting her in the car?

845
00:59:12,315 --> 00:59:16,274
Like who? He's the only one
left on this block. Come on.

846
00:59:22,692 --> 00:59:25,183
Hold it. Put her down.

847
00:59:31,334 --> 00:59:34,770
Mac, is there anything I can do?

848
00:59:34,837 --> 00:59:36,998
You just sit tight, honey.

849
00:59:37,073 --> 00:59:39,371
This is work for the big boys.

850
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:44,270
You've seen enough of this stuff
for one day. It's degenerate.

851
00:59:44,647 --> 00:59:47,115
The whole thing's degenerate.

852
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:55,551
Now you just sit tight. Daddy will be back
for you in a little while. Yeah?

853
00:59:55,758 --> 00:59:58,591
Mac, I told you, I am not a child.

854
00:59:59,062 --> 01:00:03,328
That's for sure. You think I'd leave
a kid alone with this wacko?

855
01:00:03,399 --> 01:00:05,060
He's out of his goddamn noodle.

856
01:00:05,134 --> 01:00:09,195
But you wouldn't mind leaving a
grown woman alone with him, is that it?

857
01:00:09,439 --> 01:00:12,237
Mind leaving a grown woman
alone with him?

858
01:00:13,242 --> 01:00:16,075
That's rich. Don't you know about this guy?

859
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:19,514
He couldn't get his rope to rise
with a magic flute.

860
01:00:21,584 --> 01:00:25,680
Mind leaving her alone with him,
that's a howl.

861
01:00:25,888 --> 01:00:28,288
Come on. Let's get her out of here.

862
01:00:35,398 --> 01:00:37,161
Hold it.

863
01:00:38,501 --> 01:00:41,732
You got something
to tie this thing closed with?

864
01:01:17,874 --> 01:01:20,638
You just sit tight, all right? Come on.

865
01:01:21,177 --> 01:01:24,044
I've been thinking. I mean,
you know, about my deportment?

866
01:01:24,113 --> 01:01:26,638
It's okay for this nickel-and-dime,
motor-court stuff...

867
01:01:26,716 --> 01:01:28,240
but what about in the real movies?

868
01:01:28,317 --> 01:01:30,979
- Don't worry. You can get new.
- Yeah?

869
01:01:31,054 --> 01:01:32,783
Yeah, come on.

870
01:02:00,283 --> 01:02:04,777
What did he mean about getting your
rope to rise? Do you do magic tricks?

871
01:02:04,854 --> 01:02:06,947
All but that one, Miss Cake.

872
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:15,895
Was she a good friend of yours?
I thought she was awfully sweet.

873
01:02:16,132 --> 01:02:20,569
She was much smaller than she looks
in Chicago. I mean, in the movies.

874
01:02:20,670 --> 01:02:23,161
- Miss Cake.
- I know.

875
01:02:23,406 --> 01:02:26,705
You want me to shut up.
You think I'm just a silly little girl.

876
01:02:26,776 --> 01:02:30,337
I don't mind if you do.
It's when he does, it gets me sore.

877
01:02:31,814 --> 01:02:36,649
Did you really want that boy Rex
to do it with her when she was dead?

878
01:02:42,391 --> 01:02:45,519
- Listen, Miss Cake-
- I think you meant it all right.

879
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:47,825
I bet you're not afraid to do anything.

880
01:02:47,897 --> 01:02:50,388
Like what you were doing
when we came in here.

881
01:02:50,466 --> 01:02:53,196
I never saw anything so intense
in all my life.

882
01:02:53,269 --> 01:02:57,399
You didn't even know we were here. I bet
you didn't even know what time it was.

883
01:02:57,473 --> 01:03:00,271
I bet you never think
about things like that.

884
01:03:00,343 --> 01:03:04,109
Once, when I was in college,
I stayed up all night to write an essay...

885
01:03:04,180 --> 01:03:06,842
and I didn't think about
what time it was once.

886
01:03:06,916 --> 01:03:10,545
Miss Cake, I'm going to have to ask
for a little silence now.

887
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:12,554
Go ahead and think I'm a silly little girl.

888
01:03:12,655 --> 01:03:16,386
I don't mind if you do. Know why?
Because he thinks you're a little boy...

889
01:03:16,459 --> 01:03:18,017
a silly little Boy Wonder.

890
01:03:18,094 --> 01:03:20,187
Know what he told me
in the car on the way here?

891
01:03:20,263 --> 01:03:24,097
He said you were so silly that you
didn't even know the time of day.

892
01:03:24,167 --> 01:03:26,897
Just shows you
what a truly limited guy he is.

893
01:03:26,969 --> 01:03:29,028
Honest to God, Miss Cake, I don't-

894
01:03:29,105 --> 01:03:32,472
Wait a minute. I'm not the only one
who thinks you're intense.

895
01:03:32,542 --> 01:03:34,567
This guy Clark Gable thinks so, too.

896
01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:36,407
He told us, out front of the house.

897
01:03:36,479 --> 01:03:40,142
He said he thought you were the only
genius that ever worked in the cinema.

898
01:03:41,417 --> 01:03:42,441
Who?

899
01:03:42,518 --> 01:03:46,477
Clark Gable, the new kid at Pathé.
He's looking for you. Know what he wants?

900
01:03:46,556 --> 01:03:50,253
He wants you to direct a movie,
a real movie again...

901
01:03:50,326 --> 01:03:53,295
at Pathé. He told us,
out front of the house.

902
01:03:54,263 --> 01:03:56,390
- He what?
- That's right.

903
01:03:56,999 --> 01:04:00,264
Know what Mac told him?
He's such a limited guy.

904
01:04:00,336 --> 01:04:04,796
He said, "Forget it, kid. Everybody knows
about the Boy Wonder and the real movies."

905
01:04:04,874 --> 01:04:07,638
But I don't see why you couldn't do it.

906
01:04:09,011 --> 01:04:10,410
Do what?

907
01:04:10,479 --> 01:04:14,313
Direct this Clark Gable in a movie.
He really wants you bad.

908
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:16,712
Know what he said?
He said, "I know I'm good...

909
01:04:16,786 --> 01:04:19,653
"but with the Boy Wonder directing me,
I could be great."

910
01:04:19,722 --> 01:04:22,623
And I could see what he meant.
He's a good-looking guy...

911
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:25,889
but he's got these ears
you wouldn't believe, I mean...

912
01:04:27,163 --> 01:04:28,630
All right, Miss Cake.

913
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:32,532
I know you're upset.
She was a good friend of yours, wasn't she?

914
01:04:33,502 --> 01:04:36,903
- Miss Cake...
- Why don't you call me Cathy?

915
01:04:42,278 --> 01:04:46,009
Look, I know she was a good friend of yours
and that you're upset.

916
01:04:49,285 --> 01:04:52,948
But I think maybe what's
really bothering you is that...

917
01:04:54,557 --> 01:04:58,960
you got half a movie done and your leading
lady's in the trunk of Big Mac's car.

918
01:04:59,762 --> 01:05:01,730
Isn't that really it?

919
01:05:10,973 --> 01:05:13,453
Look, you can tell me
'cause I for one don't

920
01:05:13,454 --> 01:05:15,933
think you're out of your
noodle, particularly.

921
01:05:16,212 --> 01:05:19,978
That's a very kind thing
for you to say, Miss Cake.

922
01:05:21,517 --> 01:05:26,477
And I don't know so much about your
rope not rising and stuff, either...

923
01:05:26,889 --> 01:05:30,290
because I've seen you work.
I saw you when we came in.

924
01:05:32,094 --> 01:05:35,996
You may still be just a ghost story
to this Clark Gable...

925
01:05:36,699 --> 01:05:38,462
but I've seen you work.

926
01:05:39,101 --> 01:05:41,501
And while I was watching you...

927
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:46,637
I thought about what he said, about being
good, but you could make him great...

928
01:05:46,842 --> 01:05:50,073
because, you know,
I'm going to be in the movies.

929
01:05:50,479 --> 01:05:53,915
- Big Mac's going to put me in the movies.
- So he said.

930
01:05:53,983 --> 01:05:55,314
So he said.

931
01:05:55,918 --> 01:05:58,682
And he's going to, too.
Don't you worry about that.

932
01:06:00,156 --> 01:06:02,784
Do I look worried to you, Miss Cake?

933
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:07,559
Now don't get mad.
I'm just trying to tell you.

934
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:11,589
I think you're a genius.
I've seen every movie you've ever made...

935
01:06:11,667 --> 01:06:13,157
just like everybody else.

936
01:06:13,235 --> 01:06:17,103
And I want to be in the movies,
just like everybody else.

937
01:06:17,540 --> 01:06:19,804
Only I'm really going to be...

938
01:06:19,942 --> 01:06:23,400
because Big Mac thinks I'd be
pretty hot stuff up there.

939
01:06:23,646 --> 01:06:26,241
So he said.

940
01:06:27,984 --> 01:06:29,611
But the guy's a hamburger.

941
01:06:29,685 --> 01:06:32,620
I mean, you know it, I know it,
so why should we kid ourselves?

942
01:06:32,688 --> 01:06:33,848
Why indeed, Miss Cake?

943
01:06:33,923 --> 01:06:38,690
But he's not so dumb that he didn't
offer you a six-picture contract...

944
01:06:39,228 --> 01:06:42,322
when everybody else thought
you were a ghost story.

945
01:06:42,498 --> 01:06:45,865
And you're not so dumb
that you didn't take it.

946
01:06:47,303 --> 01:06:49,271
And I'm not so dumb as you think.

947
01:06:50,339 --> 01:06:52,307
So let's talk freely...

948
01:06:53,275 --> 01:06:55,243
like two mature adults.

949
01:06:56,412 --> 01:06:58,107
By all means.

950
01:06:59,281 --> 01:07:00,543
Let's...

951
01:07:04,086 --> 01:07:06,020
What's on your mind, toots?

952
01:07:16,565 --> 01:07:18,726
I want you to make me great.

953
01:07:19,635 --> 01:07:22,229
I want you to teach me what are inserts.

954
01:07:25,041 --> 01:07:28,238
- You are a silly little girl, Miss Cake.
- I'm not.

955
01:07:28,544 --> 01:07:30,603
And I've just seen you work.

956
01:07:31,714 --> 01:07:35,548
And a silly little girl wouldn't
make you a deal like a mature adult.

957
01:07:36,185 --> 01:07:39,746
A deal, Miss Cake?

958
01:07:39,855 --> 01:07:42,688
A mature adult deal?

959
01:07:42,825 --> 01:07:46,852
Go ahead and laugh, but that's what
I'm saying. A deal.

960
01:07:50,266 --> 01:07:53,997
I don't even know what inserts are
but I'll do them. I'll do anything you say.

961
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:57,597
- Don't you think I know that? Forget it.
- You need me.

962
01:07:57,807 --> 01:07:59,035
No soap.

963
01:07:59,308 --> 01:08:01,242
You want to finish this movie?

964
01:08:01,877 --> 01:08:03,276
It finished with Harlene.

965
01:08:03,345 --> 01:08:05,245
It didn't. You were going to use her dead.

966
01:08:05,514 --> 01:08:07,675
She was dead when it started.

967
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:11,584
You're lying. I saw you work.
You got close, you know you did.

968
01:08:13,422 --> 01:08:15,856
You want to think I'm using you...

969
01:08:17,827 --> 01:08:22,423
go ahead, what difference does it make
as long as you get this movie finished?

970
01:08:22,498 --> 01:08:24,591
- Watch your step, Miss Cake.
- Why?

971
01:08:24,867 --> 01:08:28,234
Because you're making me like you
a little bit too fast.

972
01:08:28,704 --> 01:08:32,470
- Why don't you call me, Cathy?
- Why don't you take off your blouse?

973
01:08:46,489 --> 01:08:48,047
Okay.

974
01:08:50,159 --> 01:08:52,024
Okay, Miss Cake.

975
01:08:54,029 --> 01:08:57,396
Let us see exactly...

976
01:08:58,267 --> 01:09:02,431
how far down into it we can get.

977
01:09:02,938 --> 01:09:04,530
Into what?

978
01:09:06,242 --> 01:09:08,733
Into the valley of indecency.

979
01:09:12,781 --> 01:09:15,477
That's a pretty crummy
way of looking at it.

980
01:09:15,551 --> 01:09:19,612
The trick, Miss Cake,
is not to look at it at all, but simply...

981
01:09:20,389 --> 01:09:24,257
limp to the edge of patience
and let yourself fall.

982
01:09:24,693 --> 01:09:26,058
Look up here, please.

983
01:09:26,428 --> 01:09:27,417
Oops.

984
01:09:27,596 --> 01:09:30,895
- Hot, Miss Cake. Hot work.
- I can take it.

985
01:09:30,966 --> 01:09:34,493
I'm sure you can.
But a day will come, Miss Cake...

986
01:09:35,104 --> 01:09:36,162
when you can't.

987
01:09:36,238 --> 01:09:37,671
Not for me.

988
01:09:37,740 --> 01:09:39,230
Perhaps not.

989
01:09:40,409 --> 01:09:42,104
If you're any good, it will.

990
01:09:42,178 --> 01:09:46,808
And then, Miss Cake,
you will be faced with the...

991
01:09:47,416 --> 01:09:49,316
penultimate decision.

992
01:09:50,186 --> 01:09:55,180
Do you do the intelligent thing
and bow out gracefully...

993
01:09:55,891 --> 01:09:57,688
or do you continue...

994
01:09:58,761 --> 01:10:00,922
against all that is holy...

995
01:10:01,497 --> 01:10:04,864
and make up your mind
to vanish once and for all...

996
01:10:04,934 --> 01:10:07,300
into the mists of self?

997
01:10:08,070 --> 01:10:10,197
I'll go on, no matter what.

998
01:10:11,907 --> 01:10:14,034
I want to be in the movies.

999
01:10:15,211 --> 01:10:17,042
I want to be an artist.

1000
01:10:19,715 --> 01:10:21,774
You mean, you want to do both?

1001
01:10:22,017 --> 01:10:26,454
Then you will be faced
with the ultimate choice, won't you?

1002
01:10:27,590 --> 01:10:30,286
You will have to pick someone to abuse.

1003
01:10:30,626 --> 01:10:33,459
The person closest to you
generally fits the bill...

1004
01:10:33,629 --> 01:10:36,689
which, by then, Miss Cake, will be you.

1005
01:10:43,339 --> 01:10:45,739
Look this way, please.

1006
01:10:51,513 --> 01:10:54,971
Do you mind my asking
what happened to you?

1007
01:10:55,050 --> 01:10:56,711
I mean, what's made you like this?

1008
01:10:56,785 --> 01:10:58,548
You had a brilliant future.

1009
01:10:58,921 --> 01:11:02,379
I fulfilled it, Miss Cake, at an early age.

1010
01:11:04,727 --> 01:11:07,753
I'm the Boy Wonder,
that's all that happened to me.

1011
01:11:08,664 --> 01:11:11,098
That's it? Pure and simple.

1012
01:11:11,166 --> 01:11:13,691
Nothing simple is ever pure, Miss Cake.

1013
01:11:13,769 --> 01:11:16,169
You know what I mean. Why are you so-

1014
01:11:16,238 --> 01:11:20,868
Talkies are here to stay. I wish to God
I was equipped to handle them but...

1015
01:11:22,511 --> 01:11:25,912
you see, I simply don't have the resources.

1016
01:11:26,415 --> 01:11:30,943
So since we are working here
on a more or less primitive basis...

1017
01:11:31,420 --> 01:11:33,217
silence will suffice.

1018
01:11:34,590 --> 01:11:35,887
No...

1019
01:11:37,026 --> 01:11:39,085
Unwrap the meat.

1020
01:11:40,729 --> 01:11:41,889
The meat?

1021
01:11:46,502 --> 01:11:48,163
You're trying to offend me.

1022
01:11:49,538 --> 01:11:53,497
On the contrary, Miss Cake,
I never have to try...

1023
01:11:53,609 --> 01:11:55,577
this early in the game.

1024
01:11:56,011 --> 01:11:58,309
Now, come on. Get the goods out.

1025
01:12:02,918 --> 01:12:06,684
First, tell me what are inserts?

1026
01:12:08,691 --> 01:12:11,319
Inserts, Miss Cake, are close-ups...

1027
01:12:12,127 --> 01:12:16,257
garish interludes in the progress
of the whole. Now, unwrap the meat.

1028
01:12:16,699 --> 01:12:19,793
If these inserts are so garish,
why do you bother with them?

1029
01:12:21,904 --> 01:12:23,235
Because...

1030
01:12:24,273 --> 01:12:26,798
keeping the whole...

1031
01:12:27,376 --> 01:12:30,004
in perspective...

1032
01:12:32,781 --> 01:12:37,684
is quite a taxing little horror, Miss Cake.

1033
01:12:39,288 --> 01:12:42,416
Now, unwrap the meat.

1034
01:12:43,025 --> 01:12:44,583
You unwrap it.

1035
01:12:45,027 --> 01:12:47,222
Let's not play games, Miss Cake,
what do you say?

1036
01:12:47,296 --> 01:12:49,958
I say you ought to take some pictures
of my face first.

1037
01:12:50,032 --> 01:12:53,195
After all, that's what they'll
be photographing in the real movies.

1038
01:12:54,503 --> 01:12:55,868
Perhaps so.

1039
01:13:09,485 --> 01:13:13,353
But it's your meat
they're going to be thinking about.

1040
01:13:20,262 --> 01:13:22,230
You didn't have to do that.

1041
01:13:24,266 --> 01:13:28,225
If you only truly meant that,
Miss Cake, we might get this movie done.

1042
01:13:33,075 --> 01:13:35,942
What's Mac going to say?
I'm not so sure about this anymore.

1043
01:13:36,011 --> 01:13:37,808
Giving up already, Miss Cake?

1044
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:39,279
What's Mac going to say?

1045
01:13:39,348 --> 01:13:42,545
Something rhetorical, in which case
you won't be pressed to answer.

1046
01:13:42,618 --> 01:13:44,552
Now lie back down on the bed.

1047
01:13:57,332 --> 01:13:59,562
He can afford to make jokes.

1048
01:14:00,035 --> 01:14:02,765
My sense of humor's
been bought and paid for.

1049
01:14:02,938 --> 01:14:05,031
You wanted to be in the movies.

1050
01:14:05,107 --> 01:14:07,041
But he treats me like a child.

1051
01:14:07,876 --> 01:14:10,310
He's only cheating himself.
He pays adult prices.

1052
01:14:10,379 --> 01:14:15,078
Hey, why do you say things like that?
I mean, what kind of a guy are you?

1053
01:14:15,284 --> 01:14:17,548
No wonder you can't get your rope to rise.

1054
01:14:17,619 --> 01:14:19,086
Look...

1055
01:14:20,789 --> 01:14:23,883
I've been in the business
a long time, okay?

1056
01:14:24,693 --> 01:14:26,354
Now move your hands.

1057
01:14:26,428 --> 01:14:30,023
No. Now what's that supposed to be,
some kind of apology?

1058
01:14:30,666 --> 01:14:34,067
You want me to move my hands?
You tell me what's under them.

1059
01:14:34,136 --> 01:14:36,627
Oh, Jesus. Breasts, okay?

1060
01:14:36,705 --> 01:14:41,039
Soft, trembling mounds
of pear-shaped fragrance, okay?

1061
01:14:41,210 --> 01:14:42,802
Now move your hands.

1062
01:14:44,913 --> 01:14:47,780
You really do think I'm
a silly little girl.

1063
01:14:48,383 --> 01:14:52,820
Okay, now we're ready to roll.
Now, Miss Cake, here's the scene.

1064
01:14:53,255 --> 01:14:56,850
You are being raped. Raped and strangled...

1065
01:14:57,292 --> 01:14:59,385
with a silken ascot.

1066
01:15:01,463 --> 01:15:03,658
I'd like you to think of that now.

1067
01:15:04,533 --> 01:15:07,331
Think about that and act accordingly.

1068
01:15:07,936 --> 01:15:09,995
It's that simple.

1069
01:15:10,572 --> 01:15:12,130
What do you mean, act?

1070
01:15:12,207 --> 01:15:14,573
The camera isn't even on my face.

1071
01:15:23,085 --> 01:15:27,283
Anybody could do this part
with the camera on their face.

1072
01:15:28,156 --> 01:15:29,384
Anybody.

1073
01:15:30,626 --> 01:15:33,754
That's where the challenge comes in,
you see?

1074
01:15:35,430 --> 01:15:39,161
You are being asked to express yourself...

1075
01:15:40,235 --> 01:15:42,567
through your tits, you see?

1076
01:15:43,038 --> 01:15:46,530
Which, after all,
shouldn't be too hard for you, Miss Cake.

1077
01:15:46,608 --> 01:15:49,202
What's that supposed to mean?
Is that some kind of crack?

1078
01:15:49,278 --> 01:15:52,736
No, the crack inserts comes a little
later. Now you ready? Let's go.

1079
01:15:52,814 --> 01:15:57,148
You know that's real swell in theory,
you know what I mean...

1080
01:15:57,419 --> 01:15:59,910
but if they're meat to you...

1081
01:16:01,189 --> 01:16:03,316
what do you think they are to me?

1082
01:16:04,059 --> 01:16:05,048
Okay.

1083
01:16:07,763 --> 01:16:08,923
Look.

1084
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:19,834
Touch yourself.

1085
01:16:21,310 --> 01:16:24,040
Feel yourself, Miss Cake. Go on.

1086
01:16:25,514 --> 01:16:27,106
Close your eyes.

1087
01:16:28,584 --> 01:16:30,848
That's it. Now...

1088
01:16:31,687 --> 01:16:33,086
stroke them...

1089
01:16:34,256 --> 01:16:35,450
gently.

1090
01:16:38,026 --> 01:16:39,857
Let the nipples...

1091
01:16:40,495 --> 01:16:43,987
ripple along the cracks in your fingers.

1092
01:16:47,936 --> 01:16:50,336
Feel how soft...

1093
01:16:51,506 --> 01:16:53,235
how full...

1094
01:16:54,576 --> 01:16:56,168
how warm...

1095
01:16:56,578 --> 01:16:59,445
You know, this is stupid.
I mean, really stupid.

1096
01:16:59,514 --> 01:17:02,176
What the hell? You were getting there.

1097
01:17:02,250 --> 01:17:03,740
You were really getting there.

1098
01:17:03,819 --> 01:17:05,150
Maybe you were getting there.

1099
01:17:05,220 --> 01:17:07,654
I was taking you there,
that is the way it is done.

1100
01:17:07,723 --> 01:17:10,692
That's not how it's done. This is stupid.

1101
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:21,394
Okay.

1102
01:17:26,842 --> 01:17:28,810
Lie back down there.

1103
01:17:35,417 --> 01:17:37,681
Come on, forget about the hands.

1104
01:17:38,086 --> 01:17:39,917
That's the girl.

1105
01:17:47,496 --> 01:17:49,327
Now close your eyes.

1106
01:17:49,865 --> 01:17:51,765
That's it.

1107
01:17:56,371 --> 01:17:59,863
It was my mistake, the whole thing.

1108
01:18:01,610 --> 01:18:05,239
Just kind of forget about
what real beauty is all about.

1109
01:18:05,313 --> 01:18:07,508
- That's better.
- Sure.

1110
01:18:11,753 --> 01:18:13,345
You know...

1111
01:18:14,523 --> 01:18:16,320
these really are...

1112
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:20,620
soft, trembling...

1113
01:18:20,696 --> 01:18:24,359
mounds of pear-shaped fragrance.

1114
01:18:24,566 --> 01:18:27,057
- You know that?
- Are they?

1115
01:18:27,135 --> 01:18:28,432
Sure.

1116
01:18:31,973 --> 01:18:34,066
White as snow...

1117
01:18:35,477 --> 01:18:37,945
soft as powder...

1118
01:18:38,613 --> 01:18:43,414
but one little pinch
and they're hard enough to cut glass.

1119
01:18:43,985 --> 01:18:45,475
Rape.

1120
01:18:45,754 --> 01:18:48,245
Even the word excites you...

1121
01:18:48,657 --> 01:18:52,058
makes things wet with pain.

1122
01:18:52,928 --> 01:18:55,158
Pain, pleasure.

1123
01:19:00,569 --> 01:19:01,968
Horrible...

1124
01:19:02,738 --> 01:19:04,535
hideous...

1125
01:19:06,007 --> 01:19:07,975
grotesque pleasure.

1126
01:19:08,343 --> 01:19:12,439
Horrible, hideous pleasure.

1127
01:19:12,914 --> 01:19:14,848
Grotesque...

1128
01:19:15,117 --> 01:19:18,280
violent, savage pleasure.

1129
01:19:19,988 --> 01:19:22,479
Savage pleasure.

1130
01:19:25,827 --> 01:19:28,523
Now move! Move!

1131
01:19:28,663 --> 01:19:30,130
Move, you're being raped...

1132
01:19:30,198 --> 01:19:31,187
God damn it!

1133
01:19:31,266 --> 01:19:33,131
Come on, you're being raped.

1134
01:19:33,201 --> 01:19:35,533
Come on, he's ripping you up the middle.

1135
01:19:37,105 --> 01:19:38,094
That's it.

1136
01:19:43,478 --> 01:19:44,467
Hey.

1137
01:19:44,713 --> 01:19:46,874
I said, hey. Knock it off.

1138
01:19:50,585 --> 01:19:51,574
Oh, Jesus!

1139
01:19:59,694 --> 01:20:01,457
Why did we stop?

1140
01:20:02,330 --> 01:20:03,957
The wind ran out.

1141
01:20:06,301 --> 01:20:08,098
Oh, Jesus.

1142
01:20:11,373 --> 01:20:16,333
I knew it could be like that.
See? I knew you could be that intense.

1143
01:20:19,948 --> 01:20:21,609
I haven't felt like that since-

1144
01:20:21,683 --> 01:20:24,652
Since the night you stayed up
to write that essay, I'll bet.

1145
01:20:24,786 --> 01:20:26,777
You're making fun of me.

1146
01:20:27,756 --> 01:20:30,748
I don't care.
You can do anything you want...

1147
01:20:31,059 --> 01:20:33,084
say anything you want.

1148
01:20:34,229 --> 01:20:36,356
I didn't ever want it to end.

1149
01:20:36,431 --> 01:20:40,094
That's all I thought about the whole time.
I just never wanted it to end.

1150
01:20:40,402 --> 01:20:42,199
Does that mean I'm at my peak?

1151
01:20:42,537 --> 01:20:45,529
When you don't think about anything
is when you're at your peak.

1152
01:20:45,607 --> 01:20:47,575
Lie back down there, please.

1153
01:20:49,144 --> 01:20:53,205
You think you're treating me rough,
but I don't care.

1154
01:20:53,281 --> 01:20:55,181
I'll do anything you say...

1155
01:20:55,250 --> 01:20:58,981
things that would have made me
sick to think about just before I met you.

1156
01:20:59,054 --> 01:21:01,488
Would it make you sick
to think about lying down?

1157
01:21:01,556 --> 01:21:04,286
- You want me to take my skirt off?
- Sure.

1158
01:21:07,162 --> 01:21:11,565
I hope you humiliate me.
I hope you make me do dirty...

1159
01:21:11,633 --> 01:21:15,569
disgusting, horrible things.

1160
01:21:16,104 --> 01:21:19,301
Violent, savage things.

1161
01:21:20,675 --> 01:21:22,802
Would you hang this up for me, please?

1162
01:21:26,414 --> 01:21:30,282
What kind of things did you have in mind,
Miss Cake?

1163
01:21:30,352 --> 01:21:33,150
Come on, you know what I mean.

1164
01:21:34,055 --> 01:21:37,821
Doing it from behind and stuff like that.

1165
01:21:39,294 --> 01:21:43,663
I don't quite think you get
the picture here, Miss Cake.

1166
01:21:43,732 --> 01:21:46,098
All I want to do is get
a couple of inserts.

1167
01:21:46,167 --> 01:21:50,194
Oh, yeah. Me, too. I'll
do anything you say.

1168
01:21:50,272 --> 01:21:53,070
I want to see it all. I want to do it all.

1169
01:21:53,308 --> 01:21:57,711
You want me to take my stockings off?
Maybe you want to take them off for me?

1170
01:21:58,013 --> 01:22:00,004
Big Mac gets a kick out of that.

1171
01:22:00,081 --> 01:22:02,572
He don't think I'm a silly girl
when I'm doing that...

1172
01:22:02,651 --> 01:22:04,585
not when I'm taking my stockings off.

1173
01:22:04,653 --> 01:22:05,642
Look.

1174
01:22:07,255 --> 01:22:08,552
Miss Cake.

1175
01:22:08,623 --> 01:22:09,851
Oh, gee.

1176
01:22:11,693 --> 01:22:13,888
Why don't you call me Cathy?

1177
01:22:19,534 --> 01:22:22,697
This can lead to nothing but a bad end.

1178
01:22:25,941 --> 01:22:29,399
I'm talking too much, aren't I?
I'm making you think I'm silly, aren't I?

1179
01:22:29,477 --> 01:22:31,206
No. Not at all. It's just...

1180
01:22:31,279 --> 01:22:33,713
You can't kid me,
I know what you're thinking.

1181
01:22:33,782 --> 01:22:35,579
I'm just a silly girl who talks too much.

1182
01:22:35,650 --> 01:22:38,346
Hey, your rope's rising.

1183
01:22:43,525 --> 01:22:46,187
I think you'd better get dressed.

1184
01:22:46,261 --> 01:22:50,220
Wait, please. I'm sorry.
Guess I shouldn't have noticed.

1185
01:22:50,332 --> 01:22:52,527
It's just not going to work, Miss Cake.

1186
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:56,627
Why don't you get dressed? This is not
going to come to anything but a bad end.

1187
01:22:56,705 --> 01:22:59,765
You want to get your movie finished,
don't you?

1188
01:22:59,841 --> 01:23:02,435
Look, I'll take my
stockings off myself, see?

1189
01:23:03,511 --> 01:23:04,978
Oops.

1190
01:23:05,180 --> 01:23:06,647
I ripped it.

1191
01:23:08,750 --> 01:23:11,617
I don't know what I'm
going to tell Big Mac.

1192
01:23:12,787 --> 01:23:16,621
He'll think of something for you,
don't worry. Now, come on.

1193
01:23:16,958 --> 01:23:18,892
Just put your clothes on.

1194
01:23:19,361 --> 01:23:20,350
No.

1195
01:23:22,697 --> 01:23:24,892
Put your clothes on, Miss Cake.

1196
01:23:25,533 --> 01:23:28,730
N- O spells no.

1197
01:23:30,538 --> 01:23:31,527
Okay.

1198
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:33,764
Okay, fine.

1199
01:23:35,643 --> 01:23:39,204
If you wanna be lounging around here
with your apples out of the basket...

1200
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:43,046
when Big Mac comes strolling through
the door, that's okay with me.

1201
01:23:43,118 --> 01:23:44,415
Is it?

1202
01:23:44,486 --> 01:23:46,078
I bet it isn't.

1203
01:23:46,955 --> 01:23:49,947
I bet you're scared he might
come in here any minute.

1204
01:23:50,091 --> 01:23:51,080
Scared?

1205
01:23:52,093 --> 01:23:53,890
Of that cheeseburger?

1206
01:23:55,397 --> 01:23:56,921
Don't be droll.

1207
01:23:56,998 --> 01:23:58,693
Droll?

1208
01:23:59,234 --> 01:24:02,692
You're scared of something.
You're shaking like a leaf.

1209
01:24:02,771 --> 01:24:05,296
I'm not scared of anything, sweetheart.

1210
01:24:06,808 --> 01:24:08,605
If you're not scared of anything...

1211
01:24:10,712 --> 01:24:13,647
how come you never go
out of your house anymore?

1212
01:24:17,052 --> 01:24:21,182
And how come you gave this kid
Clark Gable the brush this morning...

1213
01:24:23,625 --> 01:24:26,253
if you're not scared of anything?

1214
01:25:01,763 --> 01:25:03,390
Look.

1215
01:25:03,465 --> 01:25:04,454
Please.

1216
01:25:06,334 --> 01:25:10,134
I'm going to have to ask
for a little silence now, Miss Cake.

1217
01:25:14,109 --> 01:25:16,976
Honestly, you know I didn't mean it.

1218
01:25:17,579 --> 01:25:22,016
I was just acting like a silly little girl.
I won't any more, I promise.

1219
01:25:23,118 --> 01:25:24,312
Please.

1220
01:25:27,422 --> 01:25:29,822
I promise, I won't.

1221
01:25:31,092 --> 01:25:32,559
Please.

1222
01:25:35,096 --> 01:25:36,461
Daddy?

1223
01:25:41,269 --> 01:25:42,964
No...

1224
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:46,129
Look...

1225
01:25:47,142 --> 01:25:49,133
you said you wanted to be great.

1226
01:25:49,210 --> 01:25:51,974
- You said I hadn't reached my peak.
- You haven't.

1227
01:25:52,046 --> 01:25:54,173
I was good, I was damn good,
and you know it.

1228
01:25:54,249 --> 01:25:57,377
But you said you wanted to be great.

1229
01:25:57,452 --> 01:26:00,080
They would have said
I was great in the real movies.

1230
01:26:00,155 --> 01:26:02,680
But you and I know better, don't we?

1231
01:26:03,424 --> 01:26:05,289
- Don't we?
- Yes.

1232
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:07,545
You and I know that you
didn't even have tits

1233
01:26:07,546 --> 01:26:09,729
till I told you what
they were, don't we?

1234
01:26:09,797 --> 01:26:11,230
- Don't we?
- Yes.

1235
01:26:11,299 --> 01:26:13,563
And you know...

1236
01:26:14,135 --> 01:26:17,161
that it's not a very mature adult deal...

1237
01:26:17,238 --> 01:26:20,230
for you to go all resentful now...

1238
01:26:21,276 --> 01:26:25,076
before we've learned what else you've got,
don't we?

1239
01:26:25,180 --> 01:26:27,944
- Yes.
- Then shut up...

1240
01:26:28,383 --> 01:26:32,285
and lie back down on the bed,
and you'll know...

1241
01:26:33,087 --> 01:26:34,987
when to go resentful on me...

1242
01:26:35,290 --> 01:26:39,886
because it'll be the first idea that
you get that I don't give you.

1243
01:26:40,562 --> 01:26:43,292
And then you can hog it all for yourself.

1244
01:26:52,407 --> 01:26:54,807
Do you mind if I ask you a question,
Miss Cake?

1245
01:26:55,176 --> 01:26:57,474
This essay...

1246
01:26:57,545 --> 01:27:00,207
you stayed up all night
to write in college...

1247
01:27:01,849 --> 01:27:03,680
was it your own work?

1248
01:27:03,751 --> 01:27:06,549
What are you talking about?
Of course it was.

1249
01:27:08,256 --> 01:27:11,692
You, Miss Cake, spent all night...

1250
01:27:12,060 --> 01:27:15,359
slaving over a composition
of your own device?

1251
01:27:16,564 --> 01:27:18,464
Come on, Miss Cake.

1252
01:27:19,867 --> 01:27:21,835
You don't believe me?

1253
01:27:22,303 --> 01:27:26,637
Spending all of anything, Miss Cake,
requires a bit of self-confidence...

1254
01:27:27,208 --> 01:27:28,641
even a night.

1255
01:27:29,677 --> 01:27:31,770
Okay, so maybe I did copy it out of a book.

1256
01:27:31,846 --> 01:27:33,746
You think that makes me
stupid or something?

1257
01:27:33,815 --> 01:27:37,444
- Not at all, merely a thief.
- I'm no thief.

1258
01:27:37,518 --> 01:27:39,645
Look.

1259
01:27:39,887 --> 01:27:43,254
The ability to steal
from the thoughts of others...

1260
01:27:43,324 --> 01:27:46,293
is merely an indication of industry,
Miss Cake.

1261
01:27:47,328 --> 01:27:49,796
What passes for genius...

1262
01:27:49,864 --> 01:27:52,890
is merely the ability
to steal from your own.

1263
01:27:53,434 --> 01:27:54,492
So?

1264
01:27:56,437 --> 01:27:58,871
So if you want to reach your peak...

1265
01:27:59,140 --> 01:28:02,200
you'd better learn how
to rob yourself blind.

1266
01:28:05,046 --> 01:28:06,638
Now lie back down there.

1267
01:28:08,783 --> 01:28:10,717
You say the strangest things.

1268
01:28:10,785 --> 01:28:13,083
Maybe you're out of your noodle, after all.

1269
01:28:13,154 --> 01:28:15,122
The whole universe is element, Miss Cake.

1270
01:28:15,189 --> 01:28:20,126
It's all relative to production costs
and sources thereof. Prepare the meat.

1271
01:28:20,495 --> 01:28:25,489
I know what you mean.
When you say "meat," you mean "mounds"...

1272
01:28:25,967 --> 01:28:30,028
"soft, trembling mounds
of pear-shaped fragrance."

1273
01:28:30,505 --> 01:28:34,407
- How am I doing?
- Done like a pro.

1274
01:28:34,676 --> 01:28:37,270
Your meat, at least, is at its peak.

1275
01:28:37,345 --> 01:28:40,439
- Now, are you ready?
- Yes.

1276
01:28:40,615 --> 01:28:43,413
- Really? What are you going to do?
- What I did before.

1277
01:28:43,484 --> 01:28:46,476
- Why?
- Because the wind ran out.

1278
01:28:46,554 --> 01:28:47,578
No.

1279
01:28:48,189 --> 01:28:50,657
- Because I did it well?
- No.

1280
01:28:51,225 --> 01:28:52,283
Why, then?

1281
01:28:52,360 --> 01:28:56,626
Because I would have told you if I'd
wanted you to do something different.

1282
01:28:56,864 --> 01:29:01,824
And women, contrary to popular opinion,
never know when to open their mouths...

1283
01:29:02,036 --> 01:29:03,560
even to ask.

1284
01:29:05,173 --> 01:29:06,367
Action!

1285
01:29:07,408 --> 01:29:09,467
Come on! Move up and move around!

1286
01:29:09,544 --> 01:29:11,910
- How am I doing?
- Don't talk, Miss Cake.

1287
01:29:11,979 --> 01:29:14,777
- Don't move your lips!
- Why not? You're photographing my meat.

1288
01:29:16,117 --> 01:29:18,551
And he is ripping you up the middle!

1289
01:29:20,788 --> 01:29:23,382
And loving your breasts!

1290
01:29:26,227 --> 01:29:28,855
And he is...

1291
01:29:35,470 --> 01:29:37,495
The wind's run out again.

1292
01:29:53,788 --> 01:29:55,415
Why did you do that?

1293
01:29:55,490 --> 01:29:58,357
I needed an insert of
him grabbing her tits.

1294
01:29:58,426 --> 01:29:59,984
No, I mean...

1295
01:30:00,194 --> 01:30:02,856
why did you take your hands away like that?

1296
01:30:02,997 --> 01:30:05,591
Because I got the insert, Miss Cake.

1297
01:30:07,402 --> 01:30:10,303
It's kind of funny.
I mean, I'm not her and you're not him...

1298
01:30:10,371 --> 01:30:12,202
so that's really no excuse, is it?

1299
01:30:12,273 --> 01:30:14,400
I mean for taking your hands away...

1300
01:30:14,575 --> 01:30:16,236
so fast like that.

1301
01:30:16,310 --> 01:30:18,904
- Look-
- I know. It's just an insert, but...

1302
01:30:19,680 --> 01:30:22,774
it's kind of funny when you think about it,
you know what I mean?

1303
01:30:22,850 --> 01:30:25,876
I have warned you about this thinking,
Miss Cake.

1304
01:30:25,953 --> 01:30:28,820
Yeah, I know, that's kind of funny, too...

1305
01:30:28,890 --> 01:30:33,350
'cause when you were touching me, it felt
like you were thinking about something.

1306
01:30:33,561 --> 01:30:36,121
Touch precludes thought, Miss Cake.

1307
01:30:36,197 --> 01:30:39,826
What you felt was merely an illusion.
Hollywood magic.

1308
01:30:40,902 --> 01:30:42,836
And what did you feel?

1309
01:30:43,337 --> 01:30:44,429
Meat.

1310
01:30:48,142 --> 01:30:50,542
It must have been magic then...

1311
01:30:52,380 --> 01:30:55,076
because it looked like you were touching...

1312
01:30:56,150 --> 01:30:58,380
soft, trembling mounds.

1313
01:31:00,788 --> 01:31:03,723
- Look, Miss Cake.
- What's next?

1314
01:31:03,791 --> 01:31:07,056
Your cunt. I want to shoot your cunt.

1315
01:31:09,831 --> 01:31:11,321
I beg your pardon?

1316
01:31:11,866 --> 01:31:13,731
Your slot.

1317
01:31:13,801 --> 01:31:15,962
I want to do a beaver shot.

1318
01:31:17,972 --> 01:31:21,464
Don't you think you're
being a little crude?

1319
01:31:22,343 --> 01:31:25,176
I thought that might be the bottom line.

1320
01:31:25,246 --> 01:31:27,510
I guess the party's over, Miss Cake.

1321
01:31:27,582 --> 01:31:28,947
We didn't do too badly.

1322
01:31:29,016 --> 01:31:32,281
I got half my shots,
you learned what inserts were.

1323
01:31:35,223 --> 01:31:38,624
- What are you doing?
- Getting ready for the beaver shot.

1324
01:31:38,693 --> 01:31:40,661
Getting my cunt ready.

1325
01:31:42,363 --> 01:31:44,923
- Okay, knock it off.
- Knock what off?

1326
01:31:45,132 --> 01:31:47,930
Okay. Fine. Great.

1327
01:31:48,002 --> 01:31:50,732
You've made your point. Now drop it.

1328
01:31:54,008 --> 01:31:55,737
Funny stuff.

1329
01:31:56,611 --> 01:31:57,942
Cute bit.

1330
01:31:58,012 --> 01:32:02,278
When you do get to the real movies,
you ought to suggest comedy to Big Mac.

1331
01:32:02,450 --> 01:32:07,251
Slow down, let's take it a step at a time.
We haven't finished this one yet.

1332
01:32:07,755 --> 01:32:12,692
Funny stuff, Miss Cake. You're just growing
as a comedienne in leaps and bounds.

1333
01:32:12,760 --> 01:32:14,489
You're growing, too.

1334
01:32:16,597 --> 01:32:19,430
Okay, Miss Cake. You've made your point.

1335
01:32:19,500 --> 01:32:23,061
Now you don't have to prove
anything to me.

1336
01:32:23,404 --> 01:32:27,807
So who's proving anything? Let's do
the cunt shot. You got the camera wound?

1337
01:32:28,709 --> 01:32:31,644
- Don't use that word, Miss Cake.
- What, "cunt"?

1338
01:32:31,712 --> 01:32:35,944
- Think it might be a little crude?
- I think it might be a little insincere.

1339
01:32:36,150 --> 01:32:37,845
On whose part?

1340
01:32:38,419 --> 01:32:42,048
- You are moving too fast, Miss Cake.
- We're just growing, that's all...

1341
01:32:42,123 --> 01:32:46,025
both of us, growing in leaps and bounds.
Let's do the cunt shot.

1342
01:32:46,360 --> 01:32:47,486
Listen, God damn it.

1343
01:32:47,595 --> 01:32:51,087
Sorry. Beaver, slot, twat, whatever it is.
So let's do it.

1344
01:32:51,165 --> 01:32:54,931
- Listen, God damn it, Miss Cake.
- What do you want me to call it?

1345
01:32:55,002 --> 01:32:57,232
You tell me what it is, okay?

1346
01:32:57,305 --> 01:32:59,205
You tell me what this is.

1347
01:33:07,214 --> 01:33:09,682
It's a pity, is what it is.

1348
01:33:09,750 --> 01:33:12,048
It's a goddamn pity that you don't have...

1349
01:33:12,119 --> 01:33:14,246
more respect for yourself as a human being.

1350
01:33:14,322 --> 01:33:16,051
A human being?

1351
01:33:16,457 --> 01:33:18,891
That doesn't
tell me very much about my cunt.

1352
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:23,454
I don't have to tell you anything about it.
I just have to, you know, photograph it.

1353
01:33:23,531 --> 01:33:28,332
Since you've been impetuous enough to flash
it at me like some common street tart.

1354
01:33:28,402 --> 01:33:31,269
You told me about all else when
you were photographing it.

1355
01:33:31,339 --> 01:33:35,332
Merely in the quest for a performance.
We're dealing here with a more or less...

1356
01:33:35,409 --> 01:33:40,369
passive organ, Miss Cake, despite the fact
that you have been shoving it in my face.

1357
01:33:40,548 --> 01:33:44,177
- Now, shut up and lie down.
- You don't think I can make it perform?

1358
01:33:44,251 --> 01:33:45,980
I don't care.

1359
01:33:47,054 --> 01:33:51,388
We are dealing here
with a very undiscerning audience.

1360
01:33:52,660 --> 01:33:56,118
You know, Miss Cake, you've seen one,
then you've seen them all.

1361
01:33:56,197 --> 01:33:58,358
Are you talking about cunts or audiences?

1362
01:33:58,432 --> 01:34:02,869
Miss Cake, if you'd just be quiet
for about three seconds...

1363
01:34:03,004 --> 01:34:04,164
I might get this done.

1364
01:34:04,238 --> 01:34:06,263
Listen, take your time. I'm in no hurry.

1365
01:34:07,041 --> 01:34:08,599
Yeah? You may not be.

1366
01:34:09,410 --> 01:34:11,640
All right, would you hold still, please?

1367
01:34:11,712 --> 01:34:14,146
Me? It's you. You're shaking like a leaf.

1368
01:34:14,215 --> 01:34:17,776
Quiet. Just quiet on the set.

1369
01:34:18,452 --> 01:34:20,386
Want me to spread my legs a little?

1370
01:34:20,454 --> 01:34:23,014
No, that's fine. It's just fine.

1371
01:34:23,224 --> 01:34:25,818
It's fine just the way it is. Thank you.

1372
01:34:26,060 --> 01:34:27,152
Okay.

1373
01:34:34,301 --> 01:34:35,598
Okay.

1374
01:34:36,437 --> 01:34:40,874
We're rolling. Action.

1375
01:34:42,777 --> 01:34:45,245
All right, thank you.

1376
01:34:49,817 --> 01:34:53,651
That's very fine work.
You may now get dressed.

1377
01:34:53,854 --> 01:34:55,617
I don't think so.

1378
01:34:56,524 --> 01:35:00,392
- You don't think so what?
- I don't think I may now get dressed.

1379
01:35:00,761 --> 01:35:02,160
You don't?

1380
01:35:02,229 --> 01:35:05,130
I think maybe there's a little
something left for us to do.

1381
01:35:05,266 --> 01:35:08,497
- You do?
- Yeah, I do. After all, we made a deal.

1382
01:35:08,936 --> 01:35:10,028
Okay.

1383
01:35:12,907 --> 01:35:15,899
We have arrived at the crossroads.

1384
01:35:16,277 --> 01:35:19,405
We have finally arrived
at what is called the...

1385
01:35:19,880 --> 01:35:24,180
delicate situation. I...

1386
01:35:25,586 --> 01:35:26,883
Would you like a drink?

1387
01:35:26,954 --> 01:35:30,219
- No, thanks. What is it?
- Cognac. It's very good, really.

1388
01:35:30,291 --> 01:35:32,725
It's not that bathtub stuff
that Big Mac sells-

1389
01:35:32,793 --> 01:35:35,023
What's the delicate situation?

1390
01:35:39,300 --> 01:35:43,737
There comes a time in every motion picture
of this sort when one must...

1391
01:35:43,804 --> 01:35:47,604
by edict of the genre, so to speak...

1392
01:35:47,675 --> 01:35:52,305
actually photograph the act of...

1393
01:35:54,615 --> 01:35:56,549
penetration...

1394
01:35:57,151 --> 01:36:00,450
as it were. The come shot, so to speak.

1395
01:36:01,222 --> 01:36:03,019
Okay, so let's do it.

1396
01:36:04,725 --> 01:36:09,162
I don't think you quite understand,
Miss Cake.

1397
01:36:09,463 --> 01:36:12,023
Look, I said I wanted to do it all.

1398
01:36:12,767 --> 01:36:14,894
I know what you told me, Miss Cake.

1399
01:36:14,969 --> 01:36:17,199
I have ears, you know.

1400
01:36:17,271 --> 01:36:21,264
But what one says and what one
is actually prepared to do...

1401
01:36:22,409 --> 01:36:24,138
What are you looking at?

1402
01:36:26,080 --> 01:36:27,570
You poor baby.

1403
01:36:28,349 --> 01:36:31,443
- I beg your pardon?
- We can do it.

1404
01:36:31,986 --> 01:36:33,886
We can do it together.

1405
01:36:35,189 --> 01:36:37,987
Do what, Miss Cake?
I'm really afraid, I don't quite-

1406
01:36:38,058 --> 01:36:42,085
Get your rope to rise. You did it just a
minute ago and you weren't even trying.

1407
01:36:42,163 --> 01:36:44,348
For the love of
God, Miss Cake.

1408
01:36:44,349 --> 01:36:46,532
You poor baby. You're
shaking like a leaf.

1409
01:36:46,600 --> 01:36:50,627
Delirium tremens
brought on by this rotgut cognac.

1410
01:36:50,704 --> 01:36:51,728
Silly boy.

1411
01:36:51,806 --> 01:36:56,470
I know you can do it. I saw you
with my own eyes just a few minutes ago.

1412
01:36:57,778 --> 01:37:01,612
Merely an illusion, Miss Cake.
What you saw was Hollywood magic.

1413
01:37:01,682 --> 01:37:05,482
There wasn't anything magic about it.
I saw it with my own eyes.

1414
01:37:07,822 --> 01:37:10,382
It was probably some sort of...

1415
01:37:11,926 --> 01:37:13,553
prostate tremor...

1416
01:37:14,328 --> 01:37:17,058
brought on by the delirium tremens.

1417
01:37:17,131 --> 01:37:21,158
Can you imagine, every studio in town
is being fuelled by this swill?

1418
01:37:21,235 --> 01:37:23,999
Don't hand me that.
You've been sucking on that all day...

1419
01:37:24,071 --> 01:37:25,766
and it hasn't done a thing for you.

1420
01:37:26,006 --> 01:37:28,634
Delirium tremens. What a load of bunk.

1421
01:37:30,411 --> 01:37:32,436
All right, now. Miss Cake.

1422
01:37:32,513 --> 01:37:34,981
Cut out that "Miss Cake" crap.
Call me Cathy.

1423
01:37:35,049 --> 01:37:37,017
- Look, Miss Cake.
- Cathy.

1424
01:37:37,651 --> 01:37:39,676
- Look, Cathy.
- There, you see?

1425
01:37:39,753 --> 01:37:41,585
See what?

1426
01:37:41,586 --> 01:37:43,416
Look at yourself and
tell me that's a tremor.

1427
01:37:45,059 --> 01:37:46,048
Curious.

1428
01:37:46,360 --> 01:37:48,692
I don't recall having put a banana
in my pocket.

1429
01:37:48,762 --> 01:37:50,389
I put it there.

1430
01:37:50,464 --> 01:37:54,059
We put it there together. Come on,
quick, say it again before it goes away.

1431
01:37:54,134 --> 01:37:55,965
- Say what?
- Say Cathy.

1432
01:37:56,704 --> 01:37:59,332
- Don't be absurd-
- It's not absurd. Come on, say it.

1433
01:37:59,406 --> 01:38:00,566
I won't.

1434
01:38:00,641 --> 01:38:03,872
Fool, you want to get this movie done?
Come on now, quick. Say it.

1435
01:38:03,944 --> 01:38:06,003
- Oh, for Christ's sake.
- Say it.

1436
01:38:06,480 --> 01:38:08,004
Cathy, okay.

1437
01:38:08,182 --> 01:38:11,982
You're being a fool.
Come on, say it softly. Say it sweet.

1438
01:38:13,287 --> 01:38:16,518
- Cathy.
- There you go. Now say it again.

1439
01:38:18,626 --> 01:38:21,993
Now you're cooking with gas.
"Cathy, darling."

1440
01:38:23,497 --> 01:38:24,691
I beg your pardon?

1441
01:38:24,765 --> 01:38:26,756
Say it, you fool.

1442
01:38:28,469 --> 01:38:29,834
Cathy, darling.

1443
01:38:31,238 --> 01:38:34,173
That's no tremor, it's a head-on collision.

1444
01:38:34,241 --> 01:38:36,038
Now try, "I love you."

1445
01:38:36,343 --> 01:38:39,608
It's starting to melt.
Okay, take your pants off.

1446
01:38:40,648 --> 01:38:42,377
I will not.

1447
01:38:42,549 --> 01:38:46,280
Like a little boy. Like a silly little boy.

1448
01:38:47,021 --> 01:38:50,286
Look at this, doesn't even have
the sense to wear underwear.

1449
01:38:50,357 --> 01:38:53,224
Rinsing in the pool, I-

1450
01:38:53,294 --> 01:38:55,990
Now I'm going to show you.

1451
01:38:56,697 --> 01:38:59,188
Now I'm going to tell you.

1452
01:39:06,941 --> 01:39:08,568
What is that?

1453
01:39:09,576 --> 01:39:10,838
Meat.

1454
01:39:12,913 --> 01:39:16,144
No, it's not. It's magic.

1455
01:39:17,351 --> 01:39:19,581
It's your magic flute.

1456
01:39:21,288 --> 01:39:24,985
But if you want your rope to rise,
you've got to play it yourself.

1457
01:39:25,893 --> 01:39:27,019
Feel it.

1458
01:39:29,897 --> 01:39:33,924
Not like that. You know how it's done.
It's the way you want it yourself.

1459
01:39:34,501 --> 01:39:36,059
It's magic.

1460
01:39:37,137 --> 01:39:38,434
It's meat.

1461
01:39:40,207 --> 01:39:41,731
All of it is meat.

1462
01:39:43,644 --> 01:39:46,442
Go on then, bite it.

1463
01:39:46,880 --> 01:39:47,869
What?

1464
01:39:47,948 --> 01:39:50,041
Don't wait. Just do it, bite it.

1465
01:39:50,751 --> 01:39:53,879
You're crazy. I'm not going to bite it.
It'll hurt.

1466
01:39:54,555 --> 01:39:57,080
Then don't call it meat.

1467
01:39:58,826 --> 01:40:01,351
Either shut up or bite it.

1468
01:40:05,899 --> 01:40:07,958
Jesus Christ.

1469
01:40:09,036 --> 01:40:13,336
Now, feel that. Feel it.

1470
01:40:14,441 --> 01:40:15,908
Touch it and feel it.

1471
01:40:15,976 --> 01:40:19,844
Feel that and tell me it's a tremor.
Tell me what it is.

1472
01:40:20,714 --> 01:40:25,276
It's a collision.
It's a head-on fucking collision.

1473
01:40:25,753 --> 01:40:27,220
I told you.

1474
01:40:28,255 --> 01:40:29,381
Now...

1475
01:40:31,258 --> 01:40:32,816
come on.

1476
01:40:34,995 --> 01:40:36,462
I'm trying.

1477
01:40:38,966 --> 01:40:39,990
Come on.

1478
01:40:40,067 --> 01:40:42,695
Okay. Oh, Jesus, it's tight.

1479
01:40:42,770 --> 01:40:44,237
You bet it's tight.

1480
01:42:04,985 --> 01:42:07,510
Oh, Jesus, they're crazy.

1481
01:42:07,855 --> 01:42:09,220
Who's crazy?

1482
01:42:09,289 --> 01:42:11,951
Anybody who says you're not
the Boy Wonder is crazy.

1483
01:42:12,025 --> 01:42:15,222
You're the one who's crazy,
right straight out of your noodle.

1484
01:42:15,395 --> 01:42:17,226
Did I reach my peak?

1485
01:42:18,832 --> 01:42:22,666
I think you reached your peak, yeah.

1486
01:42:23,470 --> 01:42:26,803
I knew it, see.
I knew you could make me great.

1487
01:42:28,976 --> 01:42:32,309
It's like they say, Miss Cake...

1488
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:35,075
some people are born great...

1489
01:42:35,315 --> 01:42:38,113
and others have greatness thrust into them.

1490
01:42:38,852 --> 01:42:43,755
We work well together.
Who'd have guessed?

1491
01:42:44,791 --> 01:42:46,554
Who would have guessed?

1492
01:42:46,660 --> 01:42:49,356
I wish we could stay like this forever,
don't you?

1493
01:42:50,564 --> 01:42:53,533
Yeah, I guess maybe I do-

1494
01:42:53,600 --> 01:42:56,501
I wish we had a contract,
a six-picture contract.

1495
01:42:56,570 --> 01:42:58,765
Open up our own studio.

1496
01:42:59,306 --> 01:43:02,673
Get the pipes fixed. Get the pool cleaned.

1497
01:43:02,743 --> 01:43:04,472
Get you some new underwear.

1498
01:43:06,013 --> 01:43:07,605
Yeah. You, too.

1499
01:43:11,351 --> 01:43:13,581
I can't wait to see what we look like...

1500
01:43:13,654 --> 01:43:16,316
you know, up there on the screen.

1501
01:43:16,390 --> 01:43:18,824
When is this stuff going to be ready?

1502
01:43:18,926 --> 01:43:20,393
What stuff?

1503
01:43:20,961 --> 01:43:24,692
The stuff we just did, silly.
My little silly.

1504
01:43:24,765 --> 01:43:27,893
What are you talking about?
We didn't do any stuff.

1505
01:43:28,101 --> 01:43:32,470
- What do you, mean, silly?
- I mean, just now, the camera wasn't on.

1506
01:43:32,639 --> 01:43:33,697
What?

1507
01:43:34,875 --> 01:43:37,867
The camera, it wasn't on...

1508
01:43:37,945 --> 01:43:41,540
I mean, just now when we were making love.

1509
01:43:41,648 --> 01:43:43,878
What do you mean, the camera wasn't on?

1510
01:43:43,951 --> 01:43:45,680
What do you mean, what do I mean?

1511
01:43:45,752 --> 01:43:47,652
The camera wasn't on.

1512
01:43:49,890 --> 01:43:51,482
You didn't turn the camera on?

1513
01:43:59,099 --> 01:44:00,999
What were you thinking about?

1514
01:44:01,368 --> 01:44:02,699
Thinking about?

1515
01:44:04,504 --> 01:44:06,938
God, I can't believe...

1516
01:44:10,177 --> 01:44:12,839
What the hell was going through your head?

1517
01:44:13,146 --> 01:44:15,046
Going through my head?

1518
01:44:15,549 --> 01:44:17,574
To tell you the truth, Miss Cake...

1519
01:44:17,651 --> 01:44:20,381
I didn't exactly have my head on my mind.

1520
01:44:21,688 --> 01:44:25,488
If you mean your brain's in your ass...

1521
01:44:27,995 --> 01:44:29,292
I couldn't agree more.

1522
01:44:39,606 --> 01:44:41,870
What are you talking about?

1523
01:44:43,343 --> 01:44:45,777
I'm talking about the insert,
what do you think?

1524
01:44:49,650 --> 01:44:50,844
The insert?

1525
01:44:53,253 --> 01:44:56,745
The come shot, for the movie, remember?

1526
01:45:06,967 --> 01:45:08,127
Yeah.

1527
01:45:12,873 --> 01:45:17,606
The movie. Yeah, now I remember.

1528
01:45:20,047 --> 01:45:21,878
Now you remember.

1529
01:45:23,250 --> 01:45:26,686
That's great, after wasting God knows
how much time going through it.

1530
01:45:29,756 --> 01:45:31,519
Going through it?

1531
01:45:32,693 --> 01:45:33,682
Yeah...

1532
01:45:34,695 --> 01:45:37,926
going through it, like it was some
big deal, playing baby-ass games.

1533
01:45:37,998 --> 01:45:40,125
I mean, what does it take to just...

1534
01:45:41,735 --> 01:45:43,327
sit there and fuck?

1535
01:45:45,872 --> 01:45:47,669
You didn't even have the camera on.

1536
01:45:50,344 --> 01:45:52,835
I'm not surprised about you
and the real movies.

1537
01:45:52,913 --> 01:45:54,904
What do you think, I've got all day here?

1538
01:45:56,883 --> 01:45:58,214
We made a deal.

1539
01:45:59,052 --> 01:46:00,849
Big Mac's gonna walk through that door-

1540
01:46:00,921 --> 01:46:02,786
Any minute now...

1541
01:46:04,825 --> 01:46:06,986
and he ain't gonna quite get it.

1542
01:46:07,060 --> 01:46:10,552
I mean, he's gonna stand
here and see his...

1543
01:46:10,630 --> 01:46:14,794
fiancée, maybe, walking around
with her apples out of the basket...

1544
01:46:14,868 --> 01:46:18,531
and the Boy Wonder sitting there
with his log between his legs.

1545
01:46:19,606 --> 01:46:23,702
But there's something about it.
I see it but I don't quite get it.

1546
01:46:24,044 --> 01:46:25,944
Do you know what I mean?

1547
01:46:27,180 --> 01:46:28,340
Daddy.

1548
01:46:30,884 --> 01:46:32,351
Oh, Daddy.

1549
01:46:32,686 --> 01:46:36,349
- Surprised to see me, honey?
- Yeah.

1550
01:46:37,891 --> 01:46:42,521
But, honey, I told you I'd be right back,
didn't I?

1551
01:46:43,397 --> 01:46:44,659
Yeah, I know.

1552
01:46:44,865 --> 01:46:49,598
Never mind, maybe you just
forgot what time it was for a while?

1553
01:46:50,437 --> 01:46:52,166
Yeah, I guess so.

1554
01:46:53,540 --> 01:46:56,668
Just sort of forgot what time it was.

1555
01:46:59,880 --> 01:47:02,576
I mean, I don't get it.

1556
01:47:02,649 --> 01:47:04,412
I mean, do I kill you or what?

1557
01:47:04,484 --> 01:47:06,850
If I kill you, which I
guess I'm gonna do...

1558
01:47:06,920 --> 01:47:11,050
do I shoot you 'cause I'm jealous,
or do I strangle you 'cause I'm pissed off?

1559
01:47:11,224 --> 01:47:14,352
I mean, I just don't get it,
do you know what I mean?

1560
01:47:18,432 --> 01:47:21,162
Mac, I only asked him...

1561
01:47:21,802 --> 01:47:25,704
to show me what were inserts, so I'd
know for the real movies, that's all.

1562
01:47:25,772 --> 01:47:29,401
Is that true?
Did you show her what were inserts?

1563
01:47:30,277 --> 01:47:33,974
I didn't have to. She already knew.
Get out of my house.

1564
01:47:35,315 --> 01:47:38,375
What a way is this to talk
to the man who's going to kill you?

1565
01:47:38,452 --> 01:47:40,044
Don't kill him, Mac.

1566
01:47:40,654 --> 01:47:42,519
He didn't do anything.

1567
01:47:42,622 --> 01:47:45,022
That's what I mean,
that's what I don't get.

1568
01:47:45,091 --> 01:47:47,582
He looks like he didn't do anything.

1569
01:47:48,128 --> 01:47:50,961
It always looks like he didn't do anything.

1570
01:47:51,198 --> 01:47:52,790
He didn't, Mac...

1571
01:47:52,933 --> 01:47:54,628
honest to God.

1572
01:47:55,001 --> 01:47:58,300
You said yourself he couldn't get
his rope to rise with a magic flute.

1573
01:47:59,573 --> 01:48:01,598
He's just a smart guy.

1574
01:48:03,343 --> 01:48:05,311
What's with your leg?

1575
01:48:05,679 --> 01:48:07,943
What the hell's with your leg?

1576
01:48:08,014 --> 01:48:09,606
Nothing.

1577
01:48:10,851 --> 01:48:13,376
Nothing. He just thought
it was a piece of meat.

1578
01:48:14,754 --> 01:48:19,418
Why, you goddamn fruitcake loony.

1579
01:48:22,762 --> 01:48:25,526
Regret is for...

1580
01:48:25,599 --> 01:48:28,534
Get this monkey out of here, will you?

1581
01:48:29,769 --> 01:48:31,634
- Smart guy, huh?
- Hold it.

1582
01:48:31,705 --> 01:48:32,729
Mac?

1583
01:48:35,008 --> 01:48:36,168
Don't hurt him.

1584
01:48:36,543 --> 01:48:40,206
What do you mean, "Don't hurt him"?
He bit you, didn't he?

1585
01:48:40,280 --> 01:48:42,612
He bit you on the goddamn leg.

1586
01:48:42,949 --> 01:48:45,679
I ought to smack your fucking teeth in...

1587
01:48:46,286 --> 01:48:48,481
Pardon my French.

1588
01:48:48,755 --> 01:48:50,154
Get your fucking shoes on.

1589
01:48:50,223 --> 01:48:52,425
You want me to slap
his teeth in, Mac?

1590
01:48:52,426 --> 01:48:54,626
No, forget it. He's
all washed up, anyway.

1591
01:48:55,562 --> 01:48:59,589
If I didn't know you couldn't get your
rope to rise, baby...

1592
01:48:59,933 --> 01:49:01,264
Get that camera.

1593
01:49:02,569 --> 01:49:07,063
Mac, what about our six-picture contract?

1594
01:49:07,207 --> 01:49:09,937
You wanna know about
our six-picture contract?

1595
01:49:11,511 --> 01:49:12,978
Should I get the lights, too?

1596
01:49:13,046 --> 01:49:18,006
No, that stuff's junk. We'll get new.
Just take her out to the car.

1597
01:50:13,239 --> 01:50:17,869
I was gonna throw this shit in your face,
but I'm gonna hold on to it.

1598
01:50:18,612 --> 01:50:22,309
- You know why?
- No, why is that, Mac?

1599
01:50:22,382 --> 01:50:26,182
'Cause it ain't what you wanted.
You didn't finish it.

1600
01:50:26,252 --> 01:50:30,552
It finished you, kiddo.
It was your last shot and you blew it.

1601
01:50:30,624 --> 01:50:33,354
First you blew it in the real movies,
today you blew it...

1602
01:50:33,493 --> 01:50:35,927
without even going out of your house.

1603
01:50:36,162 --> 01:50:38,289
- It won't be long now till that-
- Freeway.

1604
01:50:38,365 --> 01:50:39,889
Yeah, comes through here...

1605
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:43,094
and you won't even have a house.
That'll be it for you, kiddo.

1606
01:50:43,203 --> 01:50:44,898
You're just gonna disappear...

1607
01:50:44,971 --> 01:50:48,930
and all that's gonna be left of you
is this little roll of film.

1608
01:50:49,075 --> 01:50:51,373
And that's why I'm gonna hold on to it...

1609
01:50:52,479 --> 01:50:54,572
'cause it ain't what you wanted.

1610
01:50:58,351 --> 01:50:59,784
So long, kid.

1611
01:51:12,866 --> 01:51:17,633
What do you know?
Guess who's coming up the walk?

1612
01:51:19,072 --> 01:51:23,236
It's the new kid. The new kid at Pathé.
Do you know what he wants?

1613
01:51:24,611 --> 01:51:27,444
He wants you to direct a real movie.

1614
01:51:29,449 --> 01:51:31,417
Ain't that a sketch?

1615
01:51:33,586 --> 01:51:34,814
Oh, babe.

1616
01:52:51,264 --> 01:52:53,198
You must be kidding me.

1617
01:53:27,767 --> 01:53:31,794
Oh, you can be handsome

1618
01:53:32,238 --> 01:53:36,106
and rugged and tall

1619
01:53:38,178 --> 01:53:41,409
Invest in one thing

1620
01:53:41,481 --> 01:53:45,645
and wind up with them all!

1621
01:53:48,988 --> 01:53:52,389
You can be healthy

1622
01:53:52,458 --> 01:53:57,191
and wealthy and wise

1623
01:53:58,298 --> 01:54:03,292
But I'm satisfied that my rope

1624
01:54:03,369 --> 01:54:06,896
can still rise

1625
01:54:07,974 --> 01:54:11,410
With care, bulbs will burn

1626
01:54:11,477 --> 01:54:15,743
until they are quite old

1627
01:54:16,249 --> 01:54:19,377
It's just when they're switched off

1628
01:54:19,452 --> 01:54:22,910
it sometimes grows cold

1629
01:54:24,257 --> 01:54:27,124
And yet I confess

1630
01:54:27,861 --> 01:54:31,991
with a series of sighs

1631
01:54:34,934 --> 01:54:38,199
It's sure good to know

1632
01:54:38,605 --> 01:54:41,233
that your rope

1633
01:54:41,507 --> 01:54:46,137
can still rise!

1634
01:54:56,556 --> 01:54:58,581
Unless I've missed my guess...

1635
01:55:01,461 --> 01:55:03,122
it's almost time for lunch.
