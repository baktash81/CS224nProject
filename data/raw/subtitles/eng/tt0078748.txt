Resynched for the fixed version
by ShooCat

2
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,376
Have you got any biscuits over there?

3
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,545
Here's some cornbread.

4
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:04,924
I am cold.

5
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:07,844
- Still with us, Brett?
- Right.

6
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:13,058
- Oh, I feel dead.
- Anybody ever tell you you {y:i}look dead?

7
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:20,148
Oh, yeah. Right!
I just forgot something, man.

8
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:24,319
Before we dock, I think
we ought to discuss the bonus situation.

9
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:27,655
Brett and I, we think we deserve full shares.

10
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:32,452
Mr Parker and I feel the bonus situation
has never been on an equitable level.

11
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:35,997
You get what you're contracted for,
like everybody else.

12
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,457
Yes, but everybody else gets more than us.

13
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:41,211
Dallas, Mother wants to talk to you.

14
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:45,507
Yeah, I saw it.
Yellow light's for my eyes only.

15
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,301
OK, get dressed, huh? Parker?

16
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:51,763
I haven't finished my coffee.
It's the only thing good on this ship.

17
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,856
Morning, Mother.

18
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:16,222
- Right?
- OK.

19
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:18,516
Plug us in.

20
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:21,728
Thank you.

21
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:28,485
- Where is Earth?
- You should know.

22
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:31,696
It's not our system.

23
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,573
Scan.

24
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,703
I can't believe this.

25
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:40,872
Contact traffic control.

26
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:45,377
This is commercial towing vehicle {y:i}Nostromo,

27
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:50,674
out of the Solomons,
registration number 180924609,

28
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:55,261
calling Antarctica traffic control.
Do you read me? Over.

29
00:09:55,387 --> 00:09:58,723
Commercial towing vehicle Nostromo,
out of the Solomons.

30
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:02,977
Registration number 180924609.

31
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:06,856
- Nothing.
- Keep trying.

32
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:12,070
Calling Antarctica traffic control.
Do you read me, Antarctica? Over.

33
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:16,658
I've found it, just short of Zeta II Reticuli.

34
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:19,369
We haven't reached the outer rim yet.

35
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,746
That's hard to believe.

36
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:24,666
What the hell are we doing out here?

37
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:29,170
Don't know.
What the hell are you talking about?

38
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,381
That's not our system.

39
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:32,716
I know that.

40
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:36,803
Do you ever notice
how they never come down here?

41
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,888
This is where the work is, right?

42
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:45,562
Same reason we get a half share to their one.
Our time is their time. Same old shit, man.

43
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:50,859
I think I know why they don't come down.
It's because of you. You have no personality.

44
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:03,580
- You happen to be in my seat. Can I have it?
- Yes. Of course. Sorry.

45
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:11,421
What's happening now, baby?

46
00:11:12,756 --> 00:11:18,178
Well, some of you may have figured out
we're not home yet. We're only halfway there.

47
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:22,891
- What?
- Mother's interrupted ourjourney course.

48
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:24,017
Why?

49
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:28,730
She's programmed to do that
should certain conditions arise. They have.

50
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:33,526
It seems she has intercepted
a transmission of unknown origin.

51
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:37,697
- She got us up to check it out.
- A transmission? Out here?

52
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:39,657
What kind of a transmission?

53
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:43,536
Acoustical beacon
that repeats at intervals of 12 seconds.

54
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,413
- SOS?
- I don't know.

55
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:48,541
- Human?
- Unknown.

56
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:52,504
- So what?
- We are obligated under Section...

57
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:57,384
I hate to bring this up, but this is
a commercial ship, not a rescue ship.

58
00:11:57,509 --> 00:12:00,929
- Right.
- It's not in my contract, this kind of duty.

59
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:05,725
And what about the money? If you wanna
give me some money, I'd be happy to oblige.

60
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,645
Let's go over the bonus situation.

61
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:11,356
I'm sorry, can I say something?

62
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:15,443
There is a clause which states
"Any systematised transmission

63
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:18,988
indicating intelligent origin
must be investigated...

64
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:21,366
I wanna go home and party.

65
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:23,785
Parker, will you just listen to the man?

66
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:29,708
...on penalty of total forfeiture of shares."

67
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:31,292
No money.

68
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:36,172
- Well, yeah!
- We're going in.

69
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:39,092
Yeah. We're going in.

70
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:49,227
Can we all hear that, Lambert?

71
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:15,170
- Good God.
- Doesn't sound like any radio signal I know.

72
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:20,383
- Maybe it's a voice.
- We'll soon know. Can you home in on that?

73
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:23,219
What was the position?

74
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:27,807
6550-99.

75
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,732
All right, it found the quadrant.

76
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:43,323
Ascension: Six minutes, 20 seconds.
Declination: 39 degrees, two seconds.

77
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:46,242
OK. Put that on the screen for me.

78
00:13:50,205 --> 00:13:52,290
All right. Well, that's it.

79
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:56,294
It's a planetoid. 1200 kilometres.

80
00:13:56,378 --> 00:13:59,089
- It's tiny.
- Any rotation?

81
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:04,636
- About two hours.
- What about gravity?

82
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:08,890
0.86.

83
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,644
You can walk on it.

84
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:25,907
Approaching orbital apogee. Mark.

85
00:14:29,244 --> 00:14:30,912
Equatorial orbit nailed.

86
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,794
5, 4,

87
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,088
3, 2,

88
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:42,257
1.

89
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:48,096
DOR's in line.

90
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:51,975
- Status on the lifters?
- Give me an AC pressure reading.

91
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,151
48 seconds and counting.

92
00:15:03,862 --> 00:15:06,448
Prepare to disengage from platform.

93
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:08,658
20 seconds.

94
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:11,369
18, 17...

95
00:15:12,287 --> 00:15:15,623
12, 11, 10,

96
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:18,960
9, 8, 7,

97
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:21,671
6, 5, 4,

98
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:24,174
3, 2,

99
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:25,759
1, lock.

100
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:27,719
Disengage.

101
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:33,975
Clear.

102
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:42,650
Money's safe.
Let's take her down.

103
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:54,204
- Roll 92 degrees, port yaw.
- Prime the port.

104
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,319
I'm not getting anything.

105
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:34,994
Turbulence.

106
00:16:43,128 --> 00:16:46,256
Locked and floating.
You can drop us any time now.

107
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:51,219
Initial damping's going off. Hold on, people,
there's going to be a little bump.

108
00:16:57,684 --> 00:17:00,061
What the hell was that?

109
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:02,689
Pressure drop. Must have lost a shield.

110
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:04,441
Let's go with it.

111
00:17:04,566 --> 00:17:08,111
I'm still not getting anything.

112
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:14,367
Yeah. Dropping off now.

113
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:18,747
Still dropping.

114
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:22,375
There we are, we've got it.

115
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,586
Take her down.

116
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:33,345
Navigation lights on.

117
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:09,631
9, 8,

118
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:12,133
7, 6,

119
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:14,636
5, 4,

120
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:18,306
3, 2, 1.

121
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:20,475
Kill drive engines.

122
00:18:40,078 --> 00:18:42,706
What the hell happened?

123
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:46,876
- Somebody give me an answer!
- Is the hull breached?

124
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,005
I don't see anything. We still have pressure.

125
00:18:50,088 --> 00:18:53,758
- Push the screen.
- Why?

126
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:06,688
Secondary load-sharing unit is out.

127
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:09,691
Three of the four cells are gone.

128
00:19:12,193 --> 00:19:15,447
- Is that it?
- No, hold on.

129
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:20,952
We can't fix it out here anyway and
we need to reroute a couple of these ducts.

130
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:22,412
Dry-dock time.

131
00:19:22,537 --> 00:19:24,706
Dry-dock. Tell him to dry-dock!

132
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:29,002
We couldn't fix it out here anyway.
We've gotta reroute all these ducts.

133
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:31,504
In order to do that, we've got to dry-dock.

134
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:33,673
What else?

135
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:38,261
Some fragments caked up.
We've got to clean it out and repressurise it.

136
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:40,972
How long before we're functional?

137
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:44,434
- Look...
- 17 hours, tell her.

138
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,271
At least 25 hours.

139
00:19:48,396 --> 00:19:50,774
Get started. I'll be right down.

140
00:19:50,899 --> 00:19:56,821
- What the hell's she coming down here for?
- She better stay the fuck out of my way.

141
00:20:07,582 --> 00:20:09,668
Any response yet?

142
00:20:09,751 --> 00:20:14,964
No, absolutely nothing, except
the same transmission every 12 seconds.

143
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:17,801
All the other channels are dead.

144
00:20:22,806 --> 00:20:24,891
Kick on the floods.

145
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:41,991
We can't go anywhere in this.

146
00:20:43,535 --> 00:20:45,829
Mother says the sun rises in 20 minutes.

147
00:20:45,954 --> 00:20:52,002
- How far to the source of transmission?
- Northeast. Just under 2,000 metres.

148
00:20:52,127 --> 00:20:54,421
Walking distance?

149
00:20:56,297 --> 00:21:00,260
- Can you give me an atmospheric?
- Yes.

150
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:08,685
It's almost primordial.

151
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:14,315
There's inert nitrogen, high concentration
of carbon dioxide crystals, methane...

152
00:21:14,441 --> 00:21:17,444
- I'm working on the trace elements.
- Anything else?

153
00:21:17,569 --> 00:21:21,531
Yes. There's rock, lava base.

154
00:21:23,908 --> 00:21:26,828
Deep cold, well below the line.

155
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:30,999
I'll volunteer to be in the first group to go out.

156
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:33,835
Yeah, that figures.

157
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:38,089
- You, too, Lambert.
- Swell.

158
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:41,968
You'd better break out the weapons.

159
00:22:54,958 --> 00:23:00,880
- I can't see a goddamn thing!
- Ash, are you receiving?

160
00:23:05,677 --> 00:23:08,096
Good contact on my board.

161
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:11,224
Clear and free. Keep the line open.

162
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:12,350
Let's go.

163
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:29,659
Hey, Ripley.

164
00:23:29,784 --> 00:23:33,413
Hey, Ripley, I want to ask you a question.

165
00:23:33,538 --> 00:23:36,750
If they find what they're looking for,
do we get full shares?

166
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:41,129
Don't worry, Parker,
you'll get whatever's coming to you.

167
00:23:41,254 --> 00:23:45,300
I'm not gonna do any more work
until we get this straightened out.

168
00:23:45,425 --> 00:23:49,804
Brett, you're guaranteed by law to get a share.

169
00:23:49,888 --> 00:23:52,807
- What?
- Why don't you just fuck off?

170
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:56,353
- What?
- What did you say, Rip?

171
00:23:56,478 --> 00:24:00,940
If you have any trouble,
I'll be on the bridge.

172
00:24:01,066 --> 00:24:04,069
Hey, Ripley, come back here!

173
00:24:09,074 --> 00:24:12,744
- Son of a bitch.
- What's the matter?

174
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:24,172
Can't see a goddamn thing.

175
00:24:24,297 --> 00:24:26,383
Quit griping.

176
00:24:26,466 --> 00:24:29,177
- I like griping.
- Come on, knock it off.

177
00:25:54,471 --> 00:25:58,141
- Ash, can you see this?
- Yes, I can.

178
00:26:01,144 --> 00:26:04,064
I've never seen anything like it.

179
00:26:12,113 --> 00:26:14,199
It's very bizarre.

180
00:26:18,036 --> 00:26:20,038
You said it.

181
00:26:28,672 --> 00:26:30,674
All right.

182
00:26:30,757 --> 00:26:33,885
Moving on to second... position.

183
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:36,096
What is it?

184
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:40,350
Let's get outta here.

185
00:26:40,475 --> 00:26:45,063
We've got this far.
We must go on. We have to go on.

186
00:26:48,066 --> 00:26:50,694
Will you say that again?

187
00:26:50,777 --> 00:26:51,736
Shit!

188
00:26:53,196 --> 00:26:57,242
Ash, as you can see, it's hard to describe.

189
00:26:57,367 --> 00:26:59,869
I'm going back to the console.

190
00:27:46,875 --> 00:27:48,793
Dallas!

191
00:28:41,137 --> 00:28:44,683
Come on down here.
There's something different here.

192
00:28:44,766 --> 00:28:50,814
I don't know what it is, but if we can
get up that wall, we can find out.

193
00:29:59,966 --> 00:30:03,178
Alien life form.

194
00:30:03,303 --> 00:30:06,306
It looks like it's been dead a long time.

195
00:30:06,431 --> 00:30:09,142
Fossilised.

196
00:30:09,142 --> 00:30:12,145
Looks like it's grown out of the chair.

197
00:30:22,572 --> 00:30:24,783
Bones are bent outward.

198
00:30:24,866 --> 00:30:27,369
Like he exploded from inside.

199
00:30:29,788 --> 00:30:34,668
I wonder what happened
to the rest of the crew.

200
00:30:37,504 --> 00:30:40,090
Let's get the hell outta here.

201
00:30:51,685 --> 00:30:54,270
Dallas! Lambert! Come on over here!

202
00:30:57,315 --> 00:30:58,983
Come on.

203
00:31:03,988 --> 00:31:07,951
- What have you got?
- See what you make of this.

204
00:31:19,838 --> 00:31:20,463
It doesn't look like an SOS.

205
00:31:22,674 --> 00:31:26,011
Well, I... It looks like a warning.

206
00:31:26,094 --> 00:31:30,181
- I'm gonna go out after them.
- What's the point?

207
00:31:31,641 --> 00:31:38,606
I mean, by the time it takes to get there,
they'll know if it's a warning or not. Yes?

208
00:32:04,424 --> 00:32:07,135
Are you OK down there?

209
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:13,600
- Can you see anything?
- I don't know... A cave.

210
00:32:19,356 --> 00:32:21,858
I don't know,
but it's like the goddamn tropics in here.

211
00:32:25,278 --> 00:32:27,697
What the hell is this?

212
00:32:55,725 --> 00:32:58,853
The pit is completely enclosed.

213
00:32:58,978 --> 00:33:04,275
And it's full of leathery objects,
like eggs or something.

214
00:33:23,044 --> 00:33:28,466
There's a layer of mist covering the eggs
that reacts when broken.

215
00:33:32,846 --> 00:33:35,682
Kane? Are you all right?

216
00:33:35,765 --> 00:33:37,851
Yeah, I'm OK. All right.

217
00:33:40,687 --> 00:33:42,772
I'm OK, I just slipped.

218
00:34:03,084 --> 00:34:06,212
It appears to be completely sealed.

219
00:34:40,538 --> 00:34:44,167
Wait a minute, there's movement.

220
00:34:44,292 --> 00:34:47,962
It seems to have life. Organic life.

221
00:35:53,028 --> 00:35:55,530
- Are you there, Ripley?
- I'm right here.

222
00:36:01,786 --> 00:36:05,123
- OK, Ripley. I'm at the inner lock hatch.
- Right.

223
00:36:14,799 --> 00:36:17,719
Are you there, Ripley?
We're clean, let us in.

224
00:36:17,844 --> 00:36:21,473
- What happened to Kane?
- Something attached itself to him.

225
00:36:21,598 --> 00:36:24,184
What kind of thing?

226
00:36:24,309 --> 00:36:26,478
An organism. Open the hatch!

227
00:36:26,603 --> 00:36:30,982
If we let it in, the ship could be infected.
You know the quarantine procedure.

228
00:36:31,066 --> 00:36:34,819
- 24 hours for decontamination.
- He could die. Open the hatch.

229
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:37,739
Listen to me.
We break quarantine, we could all die.

230
00:36:37,864 --> 00:36:42,243
Could you open the goddamn hatch?
We have to get him inside!

231
00:36:44,204 --> 00:36:47,749
No. I can't, and if you were
in my position you'd do the same.

232
00:36:47,874 --> 00:36:51,002
Ripley, this is an order.
Open that hatch, do you hear me?

233
00:36:51,086 --> 00:36:54,422
- Yes.
- Ripley, this is an order! Do you hear me?

234
00:36:54,547 --> 00:36:57,133
Yes. I read you. The answer is negative.

235
00:36:59,636 --> 00:37:01,304
Inner hatch open.

236
00:37:31,876 --> 00:37:32,377
My God.

237
00:37:42,095 --> 00:37:44,180
What the hell is that?

238
00:37:45,515 --> 00:37:48,977
Jesus Christ.

239
00:37:50,645 --> 00:37:52,605
What is that, man?

240
00:37:54,607 --> 00:37:58,862
- Hey, how the hell's he breathing?
- He still alive or what?

241
00:37:58,987 --> 00:38:02,407
And why don't you guys freeze him?

242
00:38:02,532 --> 00:38:06,161
How come they don't freeze him?
What's going on in there?

243
00:38:06,286 --> 00:38:08,455
- What the fuck is going on?
- You bitch!

244
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:10,874
- Jesus Christ!
- Hey! Hey!

245
00:38:10,957 --> 00:38:14,002
- You were gonna leave us out there!
- Hey, break it up.

246
00:38:14,127 --> 00:38:18,173
When I give an order,
I expect to be obeyed!

247
00:38:18,298 --> 00:38:21,843
- Even if it's against the law?
- You're goddamn right!

248
00:38:21,926 --> 00:38:24,846
She has a point.
Who the hell knows what that is?

249
00:38:24,971 --> 00:38:27,891
How are we gonna get that off of him?

250
00:38:27,974 --> 00:38:32,687
- How are we gonna get it off?
- Just a minute! I'll get some instruments.

251
00:38:39,652 --> 00:38:43,531
Right. Now, if I make an incision here

252
00:38:43,615 --> 00:38:46,951
to try and remove
one of the digits from his face...

253
00:38:47,077 --> 00:38:49,037
You're gonna do what?

254
00:38:49,162 --> 00:38:52,165
Finger. I'll try and get this finger off.

255
00:38:52,290 --> 00:38:55,085
Get this cleating on there...

256
00:38:58,004 --> 00:39:00,090
- It's tearing his scalp!
- I know!

257
00:39:02,175 --> 00:39:05,095
It's not coming off
without tearing his face off with it.

258
00:39:07,263 --> 00:39:08,598
We'll have to take a look at him inside.

259
00:39:10,809 --> 00:39:13,728
How come they don't freeze him?

260
00:39:13,812 --> 00:39:16,731
How come you guys don't freeze him?

261
00:39:32,372 --> 00:39:34,666
You can take your mask off.

262
00:39:53,226 --> 00:39:58,773
- What's it got down his throat?
- I would suggest it's feeding him oxygen.

263
00:39:58,857 --> 00:40:03,778
Paralyses him, puts him in a coma,
then keeps him alive.

264
00:40:03,862 --> 00:40:06,781
What the hell is that?

265
00:40:06,906 --> 00:40:10,535
- We've got to get it off him.
- Just a minute.

266
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:13,246
Let's not be too hasty.

267
00:40:13,371 --> 00:40:15,540
We don't know anything about...

268
00:40:15,665 --> 00:40:17,334
it.

269
00:40:17,417 --> 00:40:23,798
We're assuming it's feeding him oxygen.
If we remove it, it could kill him.

270
00:40:26,092 --> 00:40:29,012
I'll take that chance.
Let's cut it off him now.

271
00:40:29,095 --> 00:40:32,640
- You take responsibility?
- Yes, yes. Get him out of there.

272
00:40:34,434 --> 00:40:36,728
Where do you want to do this?

273
00:40:36,811 --> 00:40:39,856
We'll make an incision
just below the knuckle there.

274
00:40:39,939 --> 00:40:42,025
- Right here?
- Stand by.

275
00:40:50,367 --> 00:40:51,409
Good God!

276
00:40:55,789 --> 00:40:59,125
That crap's gonna eat through the hull.

277
00:41:00,585 --> 00:41:04,339
I think it's going to eat through
the goddamn hull. Come on!

278
00:41:04,464 --> 00:41:06,132
What's going on?

279
00:41:06,216 --> 00:41:08,218
This way.

280
00:41:16,226 --> 00:41:18,311
Next deck.

281
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:37,706
There it is.

282
00:41:39,374 --> 00:41:41,376
Don't get under it!

283
00:41:47,215 --> 00:41:49,300
Looks like it's stopping.

284
00:41:52,345 --> 00:41:54,097
Take a look at this, man.

285
00:41:54,222 --> 00:41:57,642
Brett, give me your pen.
Give it to me, quick.

286
00:41:57,767 --> 00:41:59,853
Come on, come on!

287
00:42:05,066 --> 00:42:07,652
Don't get any on your arm.

288
00:42:14,034 --> 00:42:16,202
It's stopped.

289
00:42:16,327 --> 00:42:20,373
I haven't seen anything like that,
except molecular acid.

290
00:42:20,498 --> 00:42:23,710
It must be using it for blood.

291
00:42:23,835 --> 00:42:27,797
It's got a wonderful defence mechanism.
You don't dare kill it.

292
00:42:27,881 --> 00:42:29,966
What about Kane?

293
00:42:31,968 --> 00:42:34,137
Here's your pen back.

294
00:42:34,262 --> 00:42:38,641
- What do we do now?
- Leave Kane to Ash. You get back to work.

295
00:42:40,727 --> 00:42:42,687
Oh... What...?

296
00:42:51,863 --> 00:42:53,948
OK.

297
00:42:54,074 --> 00:42:55,825
Try it.

298
00:43:00,955 --> 00:43:04,918
- Damn it. I felt sure that was it.
- Try it again.

299
00:43:06,252 --> 00:43:10,340
Feel like I've been in this place a month.

300
00:43:10,423 --> 00:43:14,511
We shouldn't have landed here
in the first place.

301
00:43:14,594 --> 00:43:18,890
We shouldn't have landed
on this damn ball, I know that.

302
00:43:18,973 --> 00:43:23,478
The sooner we patch this thing up and
get outta here, the sooner we can go home.

303
00:43:23,561 --> 00:43:25,355
This place gives me the creeps.

304
00:44:28,835 --> 00:44:31,254
It's amazing. What is it?

305
00:44:33,006 --> 00:44:35,091
I'd say it's, um...

306
00:44:36,343 --> 00:44:38,428
I don't know yet.

307
00:44:42,932 --> 00:44:46,144
- Do you want something?
- Yes, I, uh...

308
00:44:48,438 --> 00:44:51,274
A little talk. How's Kane?

309
00:44:51,358 --> 00:44:53,860
He's holding. No changes.

310
00:44:53,985 --> 00:44:56,571
And, uh, our guest?

311
00:45:01,701 --> 00:45:05,121
Well, as I said, I'm still collating, actually.

312
00:45:05,246 --> 00:45:10,794
But I have confirmed that he's got
an outer layer of protein polysaccharides.

313
00:45:10,877 --> 00:45:17,467
He has a funny habit of shedding his cells
and replacing them with polarised silicone,

314
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:23,598
which gives him a prolonged resistance
to adverse environmental conditions.

315
00:45:23,723 --> 00:45:25,684
Is that enough?

316
00:45:25,809 --> 00:45:28,103
That's plenty. What does it mean?

317
00:45:28,186 --> 00:45:32,691
- Please don't do that. Thank you.
- I'm sorry.

318
00:45:32,774 --> 00:45:39,155
It's an interesting combination of elements,
making him a... tough little son of a bitch.

319
00:45:39,239 --> 00:45:41,658
And you let him in.

320
00:45:41,741 --> 00:45:44,160
I was obeying a direct order, remember?

321
00:45:44,869 --> 00:45:50,500
Ash, when Dallas and Kane are off the ship,
{y:i}I'm senior officer.

322
00:45:50,625 --> 00:45:52,711
Oh, yes. I forgot.

323
00:45:53,628 --> 00:45:57,716
You also forgot the Science Division's
basic quarantine law.

324
00:45:57,799 --> 00:46:02,095
- No, that I didn't forget.
- Oh, I see. You just broke it.

325
00:46:02,178 --> 00:46:05,640
What would you have
done with Kane? Hm?

326
00:46:05,724 --> 00:46:09,060
You knew his only chance of survival
was to get him in here.

327
00:46:09,185 --> 00:46:13,565
Unfortunately, by breaking quarantine,
you risk everybody's life.

328
00:46:13,648 --> 00:46:16,067
Maybe I should have left him outside.

329
00:46:16,151 --> 00:46:20,655
Maybe I've jeopardised the rest of us,
but it was a risk I was willing to take.

330
00:46:20,739 --> 00:46:24,701
It's a pretty big risk for a science officer.

331
00:46:24,826 --> 00:46:28,455
It's not exactly out of the manual, is it?

332
00:46:29,831 --> 00:46:33,251
I do take my responsibilities
as seriously as you.

333
00:46:34,461 --> 00:46:38,423
You do yourjob
and let me do mine. Yes?

334
00:46:58,777 --> 00:47:00,862
- Where's Dallas?
- In the shuttle.

335
00:47:10,330 --> 00:47:13,583
- Why?
- Something's happened.

336
00:47:13,667 --> 00:47:16,378
- Serious?
- Interesting.

337
00:47:21,591 --> 00:47:25,345
Ripley, meet me in the infirmary right away.

338
00:47:28,181 --> 00:47:31,393
- Where is it?
- Well, I don't know!

339
00:47:31,518 --> 00:47:36,106
- We have to try and find it.
- Let's check it.

340
00:48:01,006 --> 00:48:03,633
Dallas, please be careful.

341
00:48:44,424 --> 00:48:46,593
Sorry.

342
00:49:19,042 --> 00:49:22,045
No, not in the corner!

343
00:49:22,170 --> 00:49:25,590
Have one of these. Just in case.

344
00:49:38,645 --> 00:49:40,313
Kane?

345
00:49:46,152 --> 00:49:47,821
Are you OK?

346
00:49:47,904 --> 00:49:52,200
- I didn't see it. Was it in the overhead?
- It was up there somewhere.

347
00:49:52,283 --> 00:49:56,579
- My God.
- Cover the damn thing, will you?

348
00:49:56,663 --> 00:49:58,748
It's alive.

349
00:50:03,044 --> 00:50:04,087
We've got to have a look at this.

350
00:50:17,642 --> 00:50:19,728
Excuse me.

351
00:50:25,358 --> 00:50:30,030
- It seems dead enough.
- Good. Let's get rid of it.

352
00:50:30,155 --> 00:50:35,994
Ripley, for God's sake, this is the first time
we've encountered a species like this.

353
00:50:36,077 --> 00:50:38,997
It has to go back.
All sorts of tests have to be made.

354
00:50:39,122 --> 00:50:43,918
Ash, are you kidding? This thing bled acid.
Who knows what it will do when it's dead?

355
00:50:44,002 --> 00:50:47,130
I think it's safe to assume it isn't a zombie.

356
00:50:47,255 --> 00:50:50,050
Dallas, it has to go back.

357
00:50:50,175 --> 00:50:55,388
I'd soon as not burn it at the stake,
but you're the science officer.

358
00:50:55,472 --> 00:50:57,891
- It's your decision, Ash.
- Dallas!

359
00:50:57,974 --> 00:51:02,270
- You won't make me change my mind...
- I'm not trying to change your mind.

360
00:51:02,354 --> 00:51:04,981
I just want you to listen...
Will you listen?

361
00:51:07,067 --> 00:51:11,237
- How can you leave that decision to him?
- I just run the ship.

362
00:51:11,321 --> 00:51:14,240
Anything scientific, Ash has the final word.

363
00:51:14,366 --> 00:51:17,577
- How does that happen?
- That's what the company wants.

364
00:51:17,702 --> 00:51:23,124
- Since when is that standard procedure?
- Standard procedure is to do what they say.

365
00:51:23,208 --> 00:51:26,961
- What's happening with the repairs?
- They're pretty much finished.

366
00:51:27,087 --> 00:51:28,838
- Why didn't you tell me?
- There's still some things to do.

367
00:51:31,758 --> 00:51:33,843
We're blind on B and C decks,
the reserve power system's blown...

368
00:51:36,054 --> 00:51:38,640
That's horseshit. We can take off without that.

369
00:51:38,765 --> 00:51:43,144
- We can. You think that's a good idea?
- Look, I just wanna get the hell outta here.

370
00:52:07,419 --> 00:52:10,046
Dust in the intakes.
Number two's overheating.

371
00:52:10,171 --> 00:52:12,465
Spit on it for two minutes, for Christ sake!

372
00:52:13,383 --> 00:52:17,345
We're hot and we're getting hotter.

373
00:52:19,222 --> 00:52:21,850
Engine room, red clip status.

374
00:52:22,767 --> 00:52:26,730
- One kilometre on ascension.
- Engage artificial gravity.

375
00:52:26,855 --> 00:52:30,400
- Engaged.
- I'm altering the vector... now.

376
00:52:34,779 --> 00:52:36,865
Inhibit CNG.

377
00:52:39,868 --> 00:52:43,747
- Struts retract.
- Struts retracted.

378
00:53:06,144 --> 00:53:07,604
Walk in the park!

379
00:53:07,729 --> 00:53:10,940
When we fix something, it stays fixed.
Don't we, Brett, baby?

380
00:53:11,066 --> 00:53:12,108
Right!

381
00:53:27,624 --> 00:53:31,503
We should freeze him. If he's got a disease,
why don't we stop it there?

382
00:53:31,586 --> 00:53:35,131
- We can get to a doctor back home.
- Right.

383
00:53:35,256 --> 00:53:39,427
Whenever he says {y:i}anything,
you say "Right", Brett, you know?

384
00:53:39,511 --> 00:53:41,304
Right.

385
00:53:41,388 --> 00:53:45,684
Parker, your staffjust follows you around
and says "Right"! Just like a parrot.

386
00:53:45,767 --> 00:53:49,312
- Shape up! What are you, a parrot?
- Right.

387
00:53:49,437 --> 00:53:51,731
Come on, knock it off!

388
00:53:51,815 --> 00:53:55,777
- Kane's gonna have to go into quarantine.
- Yes, and so are we.

389
00:53:55,902 --> 00:54:00,490
- How about something to lower your spirits?
- Thrill me, will you, please?

390
00:54:00,532 --> 00:54:04,619
According to my calculations,
based on time spent...

391
00:54:04,703 --> 00:54:07,831
- Give me the short version. How far to Earth?
- Ten months.

392
00:54:07,956 --> 00:54:10,041
Oh, God.

393
00:54:10,875 --> 00:54:12,210
Yes?

394
00:54:12,335 --> 00:54:15,880
- Dallas, I think you should see Kane.
- Has his condition changed?

395
00:54:15,964 --> 00:54:19,634
- It's simpler if you come.
- We're on our way.

396
00:54:20,969 --> 00:54:23,054
Right.

397
00:54:26,099 --> 00:54:28,601
How are you feelin'?

398
00:54:31,312 --> 00:54:35,692
- How are you doing?
- Terrific! Next silly question?

399
00:54:39,237 --> 00:54:41,322
Oh, thank you.

400
00:54:43,283 --> 00:54:47,037
Do you remember anything about the planet?

401
00:54:48,705 --> 00:54:52,042
What's the last thing you do remember?

402
00:54:58,298 --> 00:55:03,011
I remember some horrible dream
about smothering and...

403
00:55:05,597 --> 00:55:07,390
Anyway, where are we?

404
00:55:07,474 --> 00:55:09,893
- Right here!
- We're on our way home.

405
00:55:09,976 --> 00:55:12,062
Back to the old freezerinos!

406
00:55:14,147 --> 00:55:18,318
- I've got to have something to eat first.
- I need something to eat myself.

407
00:55:19,152 --> 00:55:21,988
One more meal before bedtime. I'm buying.

408
00:55:22,072 --> 00:55:25,116
Hey, that's a break!

409
00:55:45,053 --> 00:55:49,516
The first thing I'm going to do
when I get back is to get some decent food.

410
00:55:49,641 --> 00:55:55,146
I can dig it. I've eaten worse food than this,
but then I've tasted better.

411
00:55:55,271 --> 00:55:58,274
You pound down the stuff
like there's no tomorrow.

412
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:02,987
I'd rather be eating something else,
but right now, I'm thinking food.

413
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:05,782
You should know,
you know what it's made of.

414
00:56:06,950 --> 00:56:10,912
I don't wanna talk about what it's made of.
I'm eating this!

415
00:56:12,372 --> 00:56:16,543
What's the matter, man?
The food ain't that bad, baby!

416
00:56:17,669 --> 00:56:19,754
What's wrong?

417
00:56:22,382 --> 00:56:24,467
What? What?

418
00:56:24,551 --> 00:56:26,636
- This is serious.
- Kane!

419
00:56:36,021 --> 00:56:37,689
Get the spoon!

420
00:56:41,151 --> 00:56:44,070
- Get it into his mouth!
- I'm trying!

421
00:57:13,350 --> 00:57:15,435
Oh, God!

422
00:57:44,422 --> 00:57:47,050
- Dallas?
- Yeah.

423
00:57:47,133 --> 00:57:50,887
- Anything?
- No. You?

424
00:57:51,012 --> 00:57:53,098
Nothing.

425
00:57:53,181 --> 00:57:55,475
- Did you see anything?
- No.

426
00:58:17,706 --> 00:58:19,874
Inner hatch sealed.

427
00:58:23,211 --> 00:58:25,505
Anybody want to say anything?

428
00:59:01,583 --> 00:59:05,378
This is just an ordinary prod,
like a cattle prod.

429
00:59:05,462 --> 00:59:10,258
It's got a portable battery.
It's insulated from here to here.

430
00:59:10,383 --> 00:59:14,346
Just make damn sure
nobody puts their hand on the end of it.

431
00:59:16,931 --> 00:59:21,227
It shouldn't damage the bastard
unless its skin is thinner than ours.

432
00:59:21,311 --> 00:59:25,273
But it will give him a little incentive.

433
00:59:25,398 --> 00:59:27,567
Now we just have to find him.

434
00:59:27,692 --> 00:59:31,321
I've taken care of that.
I've designed this tracking device.

435
00:59:31,446 --> 00:59:34,449
You just set it to search for a moving object.

436
00:59:36,117 --> 00:59:40,622
Hasn't got much of a range, but within
a certain distance, it gives off a signal.

437
00:59:40,705 --> 00:59:43,750
What does it key on?

438
00:59:43,833 --> 00:59:47,712
Micro changes in air density.

439
00:59:47,796 --> 00:59:49,881
Gimme a demo.

440
00:59:52,384 --> 00:59:55,428
See? And again...

441
00:59:55,512 --> 00:59:57,806
Gotcha.

442
00:59:57,931 --> 01:00:03,561
Two teams. Ash, Lambert and I.
Ripley, you take Parker and Brett.

443
01:00:12,821 --> 01:00:15,865
Catch it, put it in the airlock, get rid of it.

444
01:00:15,949 --> 01:00:18,243
The channels are open on all decks.

445
01:00:18,368 --> 01:00:22,414
I want you to communicate,
keep in touch at all times.

446
01:00:22,539 --> 01:00:24,624
Let's go.

447
01:00:28,795 --> 01:00:31,381
I thought you fixed 12 module.

448
01:00:31,506 --> 01:00:33,591
We did.

449
01:00:33,675 --> 01:00:35,760
I don't understand it.

450
01:00:37,762 --> 01:00:40,682
The circuits must have burned out.

451
01:00:52,444 --> 01:00:55,905
- What have we got here?
- Damn it, hold your light over here.

452
01:00:55,989 --> 01:00:58,074
Yeah, that's it.

453
01:00:58,199 --> 01:01:01,327
I don't know if this is going to work.

454
01:01:03,496 --> 01:01:06,124
- Put this in there.
- Right.

455
01:01:10,587 --> 01:01:13,006
Check the insulation.

456
01:01:13,089 --> 01:01:15,175
Shit...

457
01:01:37,238 --> 01:01:40,158
According to this, it's within five metres.

458
01:01:45,372 --> 01:01:48,291
Micro changes in air density, my ass.

459
01:01:53,505 --> 01:01:55,799
It's within five metres.

460
01:01:55,924 --> 01:01:58,009
Be careful.

461
01:02:07,894 --> 01:02:13,441
- Hey, don't creep up on me with that thing.
- You guys stick together.

462
01:02:29,082 --> 01:02:32,210
- Whoa, whoa now...
- What?

463
01:02:32,293 --> 01:02:34,629
Parker, Brett, it's in this locker.

464
01:02:34,713 --> 01:02:36,381
In where?

465
01:02:36,506 --> 01:02:38,591
Here, take it.

466
01:02:40,885 --> 01:02:42,846
I got it, I got it.

467
01:02:45,557 --> 01:02:46,933
Wait.

468
01:02:48,184 --> 01:02:50,353
All right, Parker? When I say.

469
01:02:53,481 --> 01:02:56,526
- All right. Now.
- Easy.

470
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:05,702
- Don't let him go!
- What the hell are you doing, man?!

471
01:03:05,785 --> 01:03:07,871
It's the cat.

472
01:03:14,252 --> 01:03:18,715
Hey, look, now. We had to bag it.
Now we might pick it up on the tracker again.

473
01:03:20,717 --> 01:03:23,720
- I'II... I'II...
- Go and get it, man.

474
01:03:23,845 --> 01:03:25,930
You get him, we'll go on.

475
01:03:37,067 --> 01:03:39,152
Here, kitty!

476
01:03:39,694 --> 01:03:41,780
Here, kitty, kitty.

477
01:03:42,906 --> 01:03:45,617
Kitty crap. Jones!

478
01:03:48,745 --> 01:03:50,830
Jonesy?

479
01:03:50,955 --> 01:03:53,041
Here, Jonesy!

480
01:04:00,548 --> 01:04:02,842
Jonesy?

481
01:04:07,722 --> 01:04:10,016
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

482
01:04:16,606 --> 01:04:18,566
Here, Jonesy!

483
01:04:30,578 --> 01:04:32,747
Jonesy?

484
01:04:44,134 --> 01:04:46,094
Here, kitty, kitty.

485
01:06:13,515 --> 01:06:15,600
Kitty, kitty, kitty.

486
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:19,562
Jonesy.

487
01:06:24,359 --> 01:06:26,444
Kitty, kitty.

488
01:07:00,729 --> 01:07:03,023
Kitty, kitty, kitty.

489
01:07:06,276 --> 01:07:08,361
Jonesy?

490
01:07:15,118 --> 01:07:17,829
Hey. Hey, come on, Jonesy.

491
01:07:17,954 --> 01:07:20,457
Come on, baby. That's a kitty.

492
01:07:20,540 --> 01:07:22,542
Come on, baby.

493
01:07:23,877 --> 01:07:25,670
That's a kitty.

494
01:07:27,422 --> 01:07:30,675
Hey, I'm not gonna hurt you. Come on.

495
01:08:03,083 --> 01:08:04,125
Brett!

496
01:08:04,250 --> 01:08:06,336
Brett!

497
01:08:14,052 --> 01:08:16,137
Brett!

498
01:08:24,979 --> 01:08:26,856
Whatever it was, it was big.

499
01:08:35,407 --> 01:08:39,577
No question. It's...
It's using the air ducts to move around.

500
01:08:42,205 --> 01:08:44,708
Could he want Brett alive?

501
01:08:45,959 --> 01:08:48,128
- What?
- Could Brett be alive?

502
01:08:48,253 --> 01:08:51,464
No. I mean, I... I don't think so.

503
01:08:51,548 --> 01:08:54,968
Now, this air shaft
may work to our advantage.

504
01:08:55,093 --> 01:09:00,098
It leads up to and comes out
in the main airlock.

505
01:09:00,181 --> 01:09:02,475
There's only one big opening along the way.

506
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:08,648
We can cover that up and then we drive it
into the airlock and zap it into outer space.

507
01:09:08,732 --> 01:09:11,026
The son of a bitch is {y:i}huge!

508
01:09:11,151 --> 01:09:13,528
I mean, it's like a man. It's big!

509
01:09:13,653 --> 01:09:15,530
Kane's son.

510
01:09:16,865 --> 01:09:21,578
Come on, Ash. The science department
should be able to help. How can we drive it?

511
01:09:21,661 --> 01:09:25,749
It's adapted well to our atmosphere,
considering its nutritional needs.

512
01:09:25,832 --> 01:09:27,917
But we don't know about temperature.

513
01:09:28,043 --> 01:09:35,050
- OK, temperature. What if we change it?
- Let's try it. Most animals retreat from fire.

514
01:09:35,133 --> 01:09:39,012
Fire, yeah. Parker, can you rig
three or four incinerator units?

515
01:09:46,102 --> 01:09:47,020
- Who gets to go into the vent?
- I do.

516
01:09:47,145 --> 01:09:48,897
No.

517
01:09:49,022 --> 01:09:53,485
You and Ash,
take the main airlock.

518
01:09:53,610 --> 01:09:59,324
Parker, Lambert, you cover up
that maintenance opening, please.

519
01:10:28,937 --> 01:10:32,691
- I'm at the firstjunction.
- Dallas, I'm right here.

520
01:10:32,816 --> 01:10:34,984
- Parker?
- Yeah.

521
01:10:35,110 --> 01:10:38,947
- Lambert?
- In position. I'm trying to get a reading.

522
01:10:39,072 --> 01:10:41,783
- The airlock is open.
- OK, Ripley.

523
01:10:41,866 --> 01:10:43,535
Ready.

524
01:10:53,878 --> 01:10:56,673
All right, I've got a reading on you now.

525
01:11:12,731 --> 01:11:15,358
Open the hatch to the third junction.

526
01:11:32,459 --> 01:11:34,127
OK, I'm through.

527
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:41,092
I'm moving on.

528
01:11:55,690 --> 01:11:58,526
Dallas, hold on. I think I got it.

529
01:11:58,610 --> 01:12:01,863
- Yes, I've got it.
- Where?

530
01:12:03,323 --> 01:12:06,326
It's somewhere around the third junction.

531
01:12:06,451 --> 01:12:08,536
OK. Moving on.

532
01:12:28,223 --> 01:12:33,978
It is right around there.
Dallas, you're gonna have to be careful.

533
01:12:42,195 --> 01:12:49,703
All right. I've reached the third junction
and I'm going down.

534
01:13:08,304 --> 01:13:11,433
What the hell's the matter with that box?

535
01:13:12,142 --> 01:13:15,687
Dallas, hold your position for a minute. I...

536
01:13:16,646 --> 01:13:19,441
- I've lost the signal!
- What?

537
01:13:19,566 --> 01:13:20,817
You sure?

538
01:13:20,900 --> 01:13:26,031
Are you sure it's not there?
It's got to be around there.

539
01:13:29,159 --> 01:13:32,996
Check that out, Lambert.
You may be getting interference.

540
01:13:33,121 --> 01:13:38,126
Dallas, are you sure
there's no sign of it? It is there!

541
01:13:38,209 --> 01:13:40,628
It's gotta be around there!

542
01:13:41,463 --> 01:13:43,131
Dallas?

543
01:13:47,385 --> 01:13:49,387
All right.

544
01:13:55,435 --> 01:13:57,937
Am I clear?
I wanna get the hell outta here.

545
01:14:00,106 --> 01:14:02,734
Oh, God! It's moving right towards you.

546
01:14:10,867 --> 01:14:12,535
Move! Get out of there!

547
01:14:12,619 --> 01:14:14,829
Move!

548
01:14:14,913 --> 01:14:16,915
Dallas! Move, Dallas!

549
01:14:16,998 --> 01:14:20,043
Move, Dallas. Get out!

550
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:23,880
No! Not that way! The other way!

551
01:14:25,757 --> 01:14:27,550
Dallas?

552
01:14:27,634 --> 01:14:29,427
- No.
- Take it easy.

553
01:14:29,511 --> 01:14:31,596
Dallas!

554
01:14:36,810 --> 01:14:39,729
We found this laying there.

555
01:14:40,689 --> 01:14:42,565
No blood.

556
01:14:43,191 --> 01:14:45,276
No Dallas.

557
01:14:46,319 --> 01:14:48,405
Nothing.

558
01:14:52,784 --> 01:14:57,372
- I don't hear anybody sayin' nothing.
- I'm thinking.

559
01:14:59,124 --> 01:15:05,505
Unless somebody has got a better idea,
we'll proceed with Dallas's plan.

560
01:15:05,588 --> 01:15:11,344
What?! And end up like the others?
Oh, no. You're out of your mind!

561
01:15:11,428 --> 01:15:15,807
- You got a better idea?
- Yes. I say that we abandon the ship.

562
01:15:15,932 --> 01:15:21,438
We get the shuttle and get the hell out of here,
and hope somebody picks us up.

563
01:15:21,563 --> 01:15:22,897
Lambert, shh.

564
01:15:23,023 --> 01:15:27,277
- The shuttle won't take four.
- Then why don't we draw straws?

565
01:15:27,402 --> 01:15:30,405
I'm not drawing any straws.
I'm for killing it now!

566
01:15:30,530 --> 01:15:35,952
OK. Let's talk about killing it.
It's in the air shafts...

567
01:15:36,036 --> 01:15:38,872
Will you listen to me, Parker? Shut up!

568
01:15:38,955 --> 01:15:42,500
Let's hear it. Let's hear it.

569
01:15:42,625 --> 01:15:46,171
- It's using the air shafts.
- We don't know that...

570
01:15:46,254 --> 01:15:50,425
That's the only way!
We'll move in pairs.

571
01:15:50,550 --> 01:15:54,179
We'll go step by step
and cut off every bulkhead and vent

572
01:15:54,304 --> 01:15:58,475
until we have it cornered,
then we'll blow it the fuck out into space.

573
01:15:58,558 --> 01:16:00,643
Is that acceptable to you?

574
01:16:00,769 --> 01:16:02,854
If it means killing it, yeah.

575
01:16:06,191 --> 01:16:08,068
But we have to stick together.

576
01:16:10,153 --> 01:16:12,238
- How are our weapons?
- The weapons are fine.

577
01:16:12,322 --> 01:16:14,324
This one needs refuelling.

578
01:16:14,407 --> 01:16:16,701
Will you get it, please?

579
01:16:16,785 --> 01:16:20,538
- Ash, go with him.
- No, I can manage, Ash.

580
01:16:20,622 --> 01:16:22,624
Don't follow me.

581
01:16:26,044 --> 01:16:28,171
Ash!

582
01:16:29,506 --> 01:16:32,634
Any suggestions from you or Mother?

583
01:16:33,885 --> 01:16:36,304
No. We're still collating.

584
01:16:37,555 --> 01:16:41,726
You're what? You're still collating?

585
01:16:43,269 --> 01:16:46,106
I find that hard to believe.

586
01:16:47,565 --> 01:16:52,362
- What would you like me to do?
- Just what you've been doing, Ash. Nothing.

587
01:16:52,445 --> 01:16:58,284
I've got access to Mother now,
and I'll get my own answers, thank you.

588
01:16:59,452 --> 01:17:01,538
All right.

589
01:18:39,844 --> 01:18:43,807
There is an explanation for this, you know.

590
01:18:43,932 --> 01:18:47,560
I don't wanna hear
your goddamn explanation!

591
01:19:04,661 --> 01:19:07,163
Parker. Lambert?

592
01:19:29,060 --> 01:19:31,146
Ash!

593
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:36,484
Will you open the door?

594
01:19:40,947 --> 01:19:43,241
Let me by, Ash.

595
01:21:04,072 --> 01:21:05,865
What the hell are you doing?

596
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:26,720
Get her up! Get her up, get her up!

597
01:21:40,066 --> 01:21:41,943
It's an android!

598
01:21:56,833 --> 01:21:58,835
Jesus...

599
01:22:01,963 --> 01:22:05,175
It's a robot!
Ash is a goddamn robot.

600
01:22:06,843 --> 01:22:08,928
God!

601
01:22:15,602 --> 01:22:17,479
Holy shit!

602
01:22:18,938 --> 01:22:20,940
Help me get this fucking thing off!

603
01:22:28,531 --> 01:22:30,742
God... Oh, Jesus...

604
01:22:30,825 --> 01:22:33,036
Oh, God. Oh, God.

605
01:22:36,790 --> 01:22:39,709
How come the company
sent us a goddamn robot?

606
01:22:39,793 --> 01:22:43,755
They must have wanted the alien
for the weapons division.

607
01:22:43,880 --> 01:22:46,383
He's been protecting it right along.

608
01:22:46,466 --> 01:22:50,970
- Parker, will you plug it in?
- Um... I don't know...

609
01:22:51,054 --> 01:22:54,599
Because he may know how to kill it.

610
01:23:18,998 --> 01:23:21,418
Ash, can you hear me?

611
01:23:33,930 --> 01:23:36,433
Yes, I can hear you.

612
01:23:40,729 --> 01:23:43,231
What was your special order?

613
01:23:43,273 --> 01:23:46,401
You read it. I thought it was clear.

614
01:23:46,526 --> 01:23:52,240
- What was it?
- Bring back life form, priority one.

615
01:23:52,365 --> 01:23:55,285
All other priorities rescinded.

616
01:23:58,079 --> 01:24:02,792
The damn company!
What about our lives, you son of a bitch?!

617
01:24:02,876 --> 01:24:06,755
I repeat, all other priorities are rescinded.

618
01:24:06,838 --> 01:24:11,426
How do we kill it, Ash?
There's gotta be a way of killing it.

619
01:24:11,551 --> 01:24:14,679
- How do we do it?
- You can't.

620
01:24:15,597 --> 01:24:17,390
That's bullshit!

621
01:24:17,474 --> 01:24:22,687
You still don't understand
what you're dealing with, do you?

622
01:24:22,812 --> 01:24:25,398
The perfect organism.

623
01:24:28,026 --> 01:24:32,822
Its structural perfection
is matched only by its hostility.

624
01:24:32,906 --> 01:24:34,991
You admire it.

625
01:24:38,119 --> 01:24:40,830
I admire its purity.

626
01:24:44,084 --> 01:24:46,378
A survivor,

627
01:24:48,338 --> 01:24:50,840
unclouded

628
01:24:50,965 --> 01:24:54,302
by conscience, remorse,

629
01:24:54,386 --> 01:24:56,680
or delusions of morality.

630
01:24:58,473 --> 01:25:01,267
Look, I've heard enough of this
and I'm asking you to pull the plug.

631
01:25:03,687 --> 01:25:05,647
Last word.

632
01:25:08,692 --> 01:25:12,862
I can't lie to you about your chances, but...

633
01:25:15,782 --> 01:25:18,785
you have my sympathies.

634
01:25:20,787 --> 01:25:23,998
We're gonna blow up the ship.

635
01:25:24,124 --> 01:25:26,835
We'll take our chances in the shuttle.

636
01:25:26,918 --> 01:25:29,546
- Blow up the ship.
- Good.

637
01:25:29,629 --> 01:25:31,715
Come on.

638
01:25:58,116 --> 01:26:00,702
When we throw the switches,
how long do we have?

639
01:26:00,827 --> 01:26:02,787
- Ten minutes.
- No bullshit.

640
01:26:02,912 --> 01:26:07,792
Or else we won't need no rocket
to fly through space.

641
01:26:07,917 --> 01:26:11,963
We'll need coolant for the air support system.

642
01:26:16,676 --> 01:26:21,473
You two go down and get all the coolant
you can carry. I'll get the shuttle ready.

643
01:26:21,556 --> 01:26:24,809
I'll give you about...
about seven minutes.

644
01:26:24,893 --> 01:26:31,274
Come back up here, I'll shut the switches off
and we'll blow this fucker off into space.

645
01:26:31,358 --> 01:26:33,151
- Ready?
- Take care of yourself.

646
01:26:33,234 --> 01:26:35,528
Seven minutes.

647
01:26:57,759 --> 01:26:59,844
Take it easy.

648
01:27:04,015 --> 01:27:06,101
Jones?

649
01:27:51,688 --> 01:27:53,773
Jones?

650
01:28:23,595 --> 01:28:24,095
OK, check the bottles.

651
01:28:39,027 --> 01:28:41,112
Jones?

652
01:28:45,575 --> 01:28:47,869
- How are you doing?
- Fine.

653
01:28:50,580 --> 01:28:52,665
OK, go ahead.

654
01:28:54,250 --> 01:28:56,336
Jones?

655
01:29:01,758 --> 01:29:03,843
Kitty, kitty, kitty.

656
01:29:03,927 --> 01:29:05,929
Come here, Jones, come here.

657
01:29:06,012 --> 01:29:08,098
Jones.

658
01:29:12,477 --> 01:29:17,691
Come here, boy. Come here. Nice kitty.

659
01:29:19,067 --> 01:29:20,944
Jones?

660
01:29:22,070 --> 01:29:23,863
Jones?

661
01:29:27,826 --> 01:29:30,745
Come here. Come here, sweetheart.

662
01:29:31,871 --> 01:29:33,957
Jones.

663
01:29:40,839 --> 01:29:43,883
Jones. Jones.

664
01:29:46,469 --> 01:29:47,929
Jones.

665
01:29:53,143 --> 01:29:55,145
Jones! Goddamn it.

666
01:29:59,816 --> 01:30:01,818
Now I've got you.

667
01:30:07,532 --> 01:30:10,452
Come on, sweetheart. Nice kitty.

668
01:30:32,390 --> 01:30:35,185
Oh, my God...

669
01:30:36,019 --> 01:30:39,272
- Get out of the way!
- I can't.

670
01:30:39,356 --> 01:30:42,192
Get out of the way! It's gonna kill us!

671
01:30:42,275 --> 01:30:44,152
I can't!

672
01:30:44,277 --> 01:30:47,614
- For Christ sake, get out of the way!
- Parker... Lambert...

673
01:30:58,249 --> 01:31:00,418
Get out of the way, Lambert!

674
01:31:03,546 --> 01:31:06,800
Lambert! Lambert... Parker...

675
01:31:36,037 --> 01:31:38,456
Get ready to roll!

676
01:32:16,202 --> 01:32:18,371
Parker?

677
01:33:51,423 --> 01:33:52,966
Danger.

678
01:33:53,091 --> 01:33:57,971
The emergency destruct system
is now activated.

679
01:33:58,096 --> 01:34:04,144
The ship will detonate
in T minus ten minutes.

680
01:34:04,227 --> 01:34:12,485
The option to override automatic detonation
expires in T minus five minutes.

681
01:35:24,641 --> 01:35:26,726
Dallas?

682
01:35:33,066 --> 01:35:35,068
Brett.

683
01:35:44,119 --> 01:35:46,621
Kill me.

684
01:35:47,789 --> 01:35:51,334
