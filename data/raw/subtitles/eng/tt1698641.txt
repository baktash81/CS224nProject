there's no such thing as a bad day.

00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,340
That it's all how you look at it.

3
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,086
What can I tell you? Parents.

4
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,520
Here is what I know.

5
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,780
They're wrong.

00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:01,100

This guy knows what I'm talking about.
That's not coming off.

Did I mention my dad
is a relentless optimist?

9
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,540
We're in the home stretch.

10
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,620
And look at Mom.

11
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,651
She's not fooling anyone
with that "Mom smile."

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,740
Believe it or not,
by the time we got home...

13
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,361
this van was in better
shape than we were.

14
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,060
There's my sister Emily, the actress.

Sorry, pal. Definitely not coming off.

22
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:48,340
Bottom line, today was an epic disaster.
The worst day possible.

23
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,580
Everyone in my family would agree.

24
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,940
But what they don't know,
is it was all my fault.

25
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,940

Oh! There she is!

You are going to be so impressed.

40
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,260
I made what is known as...

the crustless quiche, the frittata.

Wow. What is this?

grill cheese, and now...

Oh, that looks so good.

00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,660
- Oh.
- Mmm. Egg and cheese.

this morning...

And then the two of us
are going to Mommy and Me Yoga.

- Oh, with Summer?
- Yes.

Will you tell her I still exist?

55
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,020
I will. And then when he takes his nap,

00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,620
I'm gonna send out some resumes.

He's going all-out, Dad.

00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,980
He's getting an energy drink bar,

77
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,580
a Korean taco truck, a live band.

78
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,620
That sounds legit.

79
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,740
I think he's having black lights
and a karaoke machine.

00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,246
Oh, I love karaoke parties.

You really should end your texts
with "x-o-x-o" or "I heart you."

do as a licensed driver

from a very good source who says...

we're being crowned Duke and Duchess

tomorrow night at prom.

Since when are you friends
with Philip Parker?

164
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,740
We go to the same psychopharmacologist.

165
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,780
He's got ADHD, too. He's super nice.

166
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,860
No, he's not.

167
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,140
He's throwing a huge party tomorrow,
and it's not even his actual birthday.

168
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,900
His is next week.

169
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,260
You realize it's just gonna
be you and me at my party.

170
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,881
- Actually, it might just be you.
- What?

171
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,660
You've gotta come.
You're my best friend.

172
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:15,820
Okay, but personally,
I think you should just postpone.

173
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,540
Philip's popular
and everybody's gonna be there.

174
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,100
Plus, his party sounds pretty dope.

175

Dude, last year
your dad tap-danced with a cane.

176
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,528
Another bad party could
ruin your rep forever.

177
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,820
Your dad's a nice guy, but trust me...

178
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,327
you do not want
your entire social life in his hands.

179
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,340

- Yeah!

182

Breathe. You gave birth.
You can do this.

183
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,260
Two. One.

184
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:46,804
Take your baby back to the womb.
They love it there.

185
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:55,166
I think that it's so cool when a guy
can step up to be a full-time fommy.

186
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,801

187

188
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,940
Oh! Okay.

189
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,846
Um, yeah, I guess I'm sort
of a fommy by default.

190
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:06,380
I was in aerospace,
and I got transitioned out of my job.

191
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,500
Oh, I'm sorry.

192
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,340

more time with this little guy.

202
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,020
Yeah! I landed an interview.

203
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,460
Hey! That's great.

204

What do you think of that?
What do you think of that?

205
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,220
Fommy just landed an interview.

206
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,646
Fommy.

207
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,140
Did you hear him say that?

208
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,220
Yes!

209

That was so cool.

214

It's so adorable!

Thank you, Julie...

219
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,380
and the positive reviews
we have coming in...

220
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,860
we are poised for a
really strong roll-out.

221
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,420
Tomorrow, we are going to ask America...

222
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,700
"Who is ready to jump on the potty?"

223
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:13,100
And I'm confident our sales are going
to leap over expectations.

appreciated this book

Is that a joke?

I have four kids that I'll just have
to carve out a little time to see.

247

Right, right, of course.
Of course you will.

As you all know, this is your
big project this semester.

253
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,300
- So, what I think...
- Mr. Rogue?

254
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,900
Yeah, Alexander.

And I have my own didgeridoo.

Yeah, I'm sure there a lot of students
here who want Australia. Am I right?

decide what country.

263

So, like,
Arnold Schwarzenegger and stuff?

271
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,260
That's Austria, not Australia.

- Can we switch?
- No.

353
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,020
I'm taking my test after school.

354
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,100
Dad already said it was cool.

355
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,260
You said it was cool?

356
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,020

Not cool. I said it was doable.

357
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,220
Okay.

358
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,020
It will be fine. We'll make it.

359
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,731
Okay, guys, I have some news.

360
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,180
Nina said that if the book
launch goes well tomorrow...

361
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,980
you could be looking at the new
Vice President of Lone Hill Press.

362
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,361
Honey, wow!

363
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:16,860
That's big.

364
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,020
Yeah, it would
be a lot more hours at work...

365
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,340
I already feel like I live there some days,
but the raise would be nice.

366
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,961
Awesome. I have some news as well.

367
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:29,260
I got a call today. I have an
interview for a game design firm.

368
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,620
They're looking for engineers.

369
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,460
- Wait, video games? Really?
- Yeah. Yeah.

370
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,900
Your aerospace engineering dad
might be designing video games.

371
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,740
- That's so cool.
- BEN: I know. I know.

372
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,140
Oh!

373
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,603
The best news of all...
Guess who spoke his first word today?

374
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,500
Trevor.

375
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,820
- KELLY: No!
- BEN: Yes.

376
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,860
What did you say?

377
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,340
EMILY: What was it?

378
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,780
He said fommy.

379
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,220
- He said fommy?
- Yeah.

380
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,443
- What's that?
- Father-mommy.

381
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,460
I didn't know that was a word.

382
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,500
BEN: Wow,
we all had pretty big wins today.

383
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,020
- Yeah.
- Yeah, tell me about it.

384
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,140
I had a crap day.

385
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,329
What is that smell?

386
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,660
It's Vegemite.
It's from Australia, and back off!

387
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,740
BEN: Hey, hey, hey!

388
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,380
Easy. You're gonna have
a good day tomorrow.

389
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:10,300
It's your birthday. You have friends
coming over, it's gonna be a great party.

390
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,380
Actually, you can forget it,
because I'm canceling my party.

391
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,940
- What are you talking about?
- Why?

392
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,446
ALEXANDER: Nobody's coming.

393
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,900
They're all going to Philip Parker's
party tomorrow night.

394
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,180
Who is this Philip Parker?

395
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,340
He's a really cool kid
with a hot tub and ADHD.

396
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,460
- I'm gonna call his mom...
- ALEXANDER: No!

397
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,540
No, no, no.
We're gonna forget about Philip Parker.

398
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,860
Whoever comes to the party comes.
It's gonna be great.

399
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,780
Trust me, nobody is coming.

400
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,500
Elliot Gibson texted pictures of me
in a butt thong to everyone at school.

401
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,340
My best friend is suddenly
best friends with Philip...

402
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,180
because they go to the same
dumb psychopharmacologist.

403
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,060
I didn't get Australia
for my school report...

404
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,540
and I burned down the science lab
with Becky Gibson's lab notes.

405
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,980
- What did you do?
- You burned down the science lab?

406
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,980
Dude, big deal.
So things didn't go your way today.

407
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,420
Go my way?

408
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,020
It was a totally wrecked bad day.

409
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,446
And it's not just today!

410
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,900
It is every single day. Every day!

411
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,900
You don't even care
because your lives are all so perfect!

412
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,340
No, we care. We care, honey.

413
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,220
- What?
- Sweetie.

414
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,420
ANTHONY: Where's Bumble Bee?

415
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,700
Alexander murdered it,
so now he's going to cry all night.

416
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,180
- Can't you just get him a new one?
- BEN: No.

417
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,220
It's only Bumble Bee.
It's the only one he likes.

418
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,380
KELLY: It's gotta be Bumble Bee.

419
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,540
EMILY: I can't deal with this.

420
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,365
I'm going to rehearse in the car.

421
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,700
Maybe this is the time
to wean him from the pacifier.

422
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,940
Honey, easy for you to say.

423
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,730
You're not here with him all day.

424

Any merry little thought

425

00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,340
Think of sleigh bells, off you go

427
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,420

431

And don't get me started
on that cute little butt of yours.

442
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,081

For one second?

I mean, of all the years for
everyone to bail on his birthday.

456
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:12,580
He's been so moody
since I had Trevor and started work.

457
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,220
Don't worry about it. He's 12.

458

Everybody's moody at that age.

459
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,940
How's he already 12?

460
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,049
I know. Just happened.

- Maybe I misheard that.
- I don't think you did.

myself a birthday sundae

1084

and I made a wish on a candle...

1085
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,780

for all of you.

able to drive Celia to the prom.

01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:19,041
Fire it up!

1393
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:20,761
ALL: Three!

1394
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:22,060
ALL: Four!

1395
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:23,361
BEN: Keep it going.

1396
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:24,961
ALL: Five!

1397
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:26,761
ALL: Six!

1398
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:29,001
ALL: Seven!

1399
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:30,961
Eight!

1400
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:33,286
Nine!

1401
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:35,060
Ten!

(CHEERING)

1403
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:49,340
Mom, Dad's on fire!

1404
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:50,380
I hope so!

1405
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:52,284
No, no, no. He's really on fire!

1406
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:53,801
(SCREAMING)

1407
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:56,060
Drop and roll, Ben. Drop and roll.

1408
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:57,361
Drop and roll!

1409
01:01:57,920 --> 01:01:58,980
Stop, drop and roll, honey.

1410
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:00,281
Dad?

1411
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:20,845
I still have me arms!

1412
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:30,961
(CHUCKLES)

1413
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:36,931
Thank you for your time.

1414
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:46,580
Nice job, you really nailed it.
Really nailed it, Ben!

1415
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:50,220
You know who you are?
You're the flaming pirate of Nagamaki!

(GRUNTING)

1417
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,850
- Thank you!
- Whoa!

1418
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:55,924
- Dad!
- Hey, guys.

1419
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:57,641
Are you okay?

1420
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:00,645
Yeah! I'm good.

1421
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:02,890
I'm fine.

1423
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:07,481
It's all good.

1424
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:10,441
It's all good.

1425
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:14,140
Dad...

1426
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:17,660
you don't always have to steer
your ship with positivity!

1427
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:20,100
You keep us up
and we really appreciate it.

1428
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:22,687
But some days are just bad.

1429
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:25,125
Nothing can fix it.

1430
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:27,241
Trust me.

1431
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:29,047
I would know.

1432
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:31,690
At least we're all together now.

1433
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:37,684
It's my job to take care of you guys.

1434
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:42,124
And, make sure you don't have bad days.

1435
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:45,331
- And when you do, it's on me!
- KELLY: Ben.

1436

ALEXANDER: I think that you just...

1437
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:51,769
got to have the bad days so you can
love the good days even more.

1438
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:56,608
This day has been terrible!

1439
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:58,961
Terrible day.

1440
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:01,450
Yeah! A horrible day!

1441
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:04,006
A no-good...

1442
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:06,726
Very bad day!

You know what I think?

1445
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:17,340
I think this day sucks!

1446
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:18,460
Yes! It does.

1447
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:19,761
Thank you!

1448
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:23,020
I love you guys.

1449
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:24,321
Come here.

Can't breathe!

1453
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:31,340
- You sure?
- Yeah, totally. Come with us.

1454
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:34,540
Okay, cool. All right, so, good news.
They have room...

1455
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:36,251
and they said we could go with them.

1456
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:39,860
Uh...

1457
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:41,241
I don't know.

1458
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:43,681
What do you mean, you don't know?

1459
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:47,569
We're not going in some busted-up
minivan with your crazy family.

1460
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,440
You know what, go without me.

1461
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:53,740
Excuse me?

1462
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:56,407
You want me to go
to the prom without you?

1463
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:58,888
ANTHONY: Yes. That's what I want.

1464
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:01,045
I'm sticking with my family tonight.

1465
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:04,007
You're choosing them over me?

1466
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:07,020
Yes, Celia. I am.

1467
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:08,260
Because they're my family.

1468
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:10,688
And if they're crazy,
then I guess it makes me crazy, too.

1469
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:13,730
Have fun at the prom, Duchess.

1470
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:16,691
What are you doing?

1471
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:19,770
(GRUNTS) Forget it.

1472
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:22,251
So, what? No prom?

1473
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:25,321
It's junior prom.
The real one's next year.

1474
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:27,330
What about Celia?

1475
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,851
I realized there's
more important things than Celia.

1476
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:34,020
- You sure?
- Very.

1477
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:35,260
Good to have you on board.

1478
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:36,561
Thanks, Dad.

1479
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:40,807
What was that for?

1480
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:42,446
I didn't wish you happy birthday yet.

a smile in your heart

It's okay.

Wow.

Guys, there is a kangaroo out there.

1494
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:10,500
And an emu.

1495
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:12,484
And a cockatoo.

1496
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:14,564
And a wallaby.

you really know your animals.

1498
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:19,180
Yeah, they're all Australian.
What's going on?

1499
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:21,860
I don't think they were meant to
be presented in quite this way.

1500
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:23,366
- No.
- MAN: Hi!

1501

You must be the Coopers.

1502
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:28,580
Hey, yeah!
This was supposed to be a petting zoo?

1503
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:31,087
A confined Australian petting zoo.

1504
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:33,820
Yeah, it is. One of the pens was
open and the kangaroo got out.

1505
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:35,540
Oh, yeah, the kangaroo.

1506
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:37,888
There was also a crocodile
in our entry hall.

1507
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:40,220
So sorry about that.

1508
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:42,380
We had him in the pool,
and we got distracted.

1509
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:44,740
You don't have to worry about it.
I'll put him back in the pen.

1510
01:07:44,840 --> 01:07:46,260
Okay, you got him from here on out?

1511
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:48,100
- Yeah!
- Okay, great. Thanks.

1512
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:49,526
We got you, Mr. Cooper.

1513
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:51,180
- It'll be fine, right?
- Yeah.

1514
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:52,620
- I don't think he's gonna get out again.
- No.

1515
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:54,684
You guys did all of this for me?

1516
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:58,727
Yeah! Your mom and I thought you
might enjoy a night in the Outback.

1517
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:04,211
You can pet him if you want.

1518
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:05,607
His name's Winston.

We've got guests coming any minute.

Emily, you're on music.
Anthony, fire up the barbie.

anything that will eat him?

Pretty cool, huh?

This party's gonna be killer, dude.

- Hey! Hey!
- G'day.

1559
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:40,220
You must be my Australian cowboys.

- We sure are.
- Awesome!

01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:09,885
I know that was a lot of shrimp!

1571
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:13,961
Dude!

1572
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:19,441
Hey, you came!

1573
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,440
Happy birthday!

1574
01:11:23,560 --> 01:11:24,740
This looks amazing!

1575
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:26,690
Yeah, thanks.

1576
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:31,531
Look, this has been
a really, really crazy day.

1577
01:11:32,240 --> 01:11:34,249
Looks like it turned out
pretty good to me.

1578
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:35,601
Yeah.

1579
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:38,620
Have a good weekend, Nina...

1580
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:39,900
Have a good weekend, Greg.

1581
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,740
- And thank you for everything.
- Thank you for your call.

1582
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:43,041
Thanks.

1583
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:48,205
How are you? How was that call?

1584
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:50,730
It was great. I got the job!

1585
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:52,686
- You got the job?
- Yeah.

1586
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:54,300
It's fantastic!

1587
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:56,260
They thought I was fun!

1588
01:11:56,360 --> 01:11:57,300
Even after you singed your arms...

1589
01:11:57,400 --> 01:11:58,980
Even after the thing and the thing.

1590
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:00,300
"I still have me arms"?

1591
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:02,700
I was a fiery pirate! They loved it!

1592
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:04,100
(LAUGHS)

1593
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:05,401
Wow!

1594
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:07,370
You know what the best thing is?

1595
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:09,300
As long as I'm getting the work done...

1596
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:11,100
I can make my own hours.

1597
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:14,290
I'll be able to still do carpool
and see the kids all the time.

1598
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:16,940
Wow, I am so happy for you.

1599
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:19,980
What about you?
What about your call? How did it go?

1600
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:22,260
Dick Van Dyke's reading went viral.

1601
01:12:22,360 --> 01:12:24,085
500,000 hits today.

1602
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:25,540
You're kidding me.

1603
01:12:25,640 --> 01:12:27,460
Nina says the book is gonna be huge.

1604
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:28,860
That is fantastic, sweetie!

1605
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:29,940
Yeah...

1606
01:12:30,040 --> 01:12:31,401
it's great!

1607
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:44,811
KELLY: I cannot believe
we pulled this party off.

1608
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:47,329
We really turned this day around.

1609
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:52,164
(MUSIC PLAYING)

1610
01:12:54,920 --> 01:12:56,201
What's that?

1611
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:03,561
BEN: What are they doing?

1612
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:08,980
That's the Thunder from Down Under.

1613
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:10,900
They're supposed to be
authentic Australian cowboys.

1614
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:12,201
KELLY: They're not.

1615
01:13:12,440 --> 01:13:13,687
No, no, no!

1616
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:15,540
Guys? Guys, PG!

1617
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:17,171
PG! Keep it PG!

1618
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:18,760
Please!

1619
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:21,530
(LAUGHS) Oh, no.

1620
01:13:32,160 --> 01:13:33,521
(ALL CHEERING)

1621
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:57,046
ALL: (CHANTING) Go, Alex!
Go, Alex! Go, Alex! Go, Alex!

1622
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:10,260
(SINGING) Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you

1623
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:12,260
ALEXANDER: After today, I know that...

1624
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:14,340
even terrible days aren't so bad

1625
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:16,563
when you're surrounded
by the people you love.

1626
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:17,940
Make a wish, kiddo.

1627
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:19,140
Because it turns out...

1628
01:14:19,240 --> 01:14:20,660
the worse things are...

1629
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:22,610
the better this family gets.

1630
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:24,260
To more days like this.

1631
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:25,300
ALL: No!

1632
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:27,260
- What are you talking about?
- Okay, okay.

1633
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:29,460
For us, this bad day...

1634
01:14:29,560 --> 01:14:31,199
was the best day ever!

1635
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:33,084
(ALL CHEERING)
