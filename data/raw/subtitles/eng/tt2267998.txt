<i>When I think of my wife...</i>

3
00:00:27,194 --> 00:00:29,697
<i>I always think of her head.</i>

4
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:33,955
<i>I picture cracking
her lovely skull...</i>

5
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:36,245
<i>unspooling her brains...</i>

6
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:39,039
<i>trying to get answers.</i>

7
00:00:40,249 --> 00:00:43,628
<i>The primal questions
of any marriage.</i>

00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:46,013
<i>"What are you thinking?"</i>

9
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:48,299
<i>"How are you feeling?"</i>

00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:51,093
<i>"What have we done
to each other?"</i>

00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:30,071
The Irish prince graces
us with his presence.

12
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:34,864
His majesty prefers
not to be moistened.

13
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:37,370
I got you a present.

14
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:38,746
Oh.

15
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,293
I hated this game. You loved it.

16
00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:41,624
You loved it.

17
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:44,085
Thank you. I'll add
it to the collection.

18
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:47,046
Can you pour me a bourbon?

19
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:55,392
What's up, Jitters?

20
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:00,188
Well, if you're not
going to talk...

21
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:01,310
I'm gonna have to
fill the silence...

22
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:04,727
with another excruciating
story by Margo Dunne.

23
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:07,442
I could tell you about my recent
customer service experience...

24
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,481
changing Internet service providers.
I like that one.

25
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:10,649
Or how about the time...

26
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:12,405
I saw that woman who looked
exactly like my friend Monica?

27
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,367
But it wasn't Monica. it
was a total stranger.

28
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:16,451
Who was also named Monica.

29
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,465
Made it kind of interesting.
It's great.

30
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:20,458
I'm just having a bad day.

31
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:22,460
Amy? It's our anniversary.

32
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,462
Five years. Five?

33
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:25,668
That came fast.

34
00:03:25,831 --> 00:03:27,174
And furious.

35
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:34,807
<i>I'm so crazy, stupid happy.</i>

36
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:38,977
<i>I met a boy.</i>

37
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:43,562
<i>A great, sweet,
gorgeous, cool-ass guy.</i>

38
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:46,981
Excuse me, miss?

39
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:48,487
I just want you to be careful...

40
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:51,319
where you put down that
monk-brewed Belgian wheat beer...

41
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:54,075
because the party's down to three
Beast Lights and a bottle of Pucker.

42
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,914
It might attract some
desperate characters.

43
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:58,830
It could. I mean, the Amish
are on a Rumspringa.

44
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,332
They already relieved me of
my artisanal meat platter.

45
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:08,248
Finally, someone tells me
how to pronounce that word.

46
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:09,332
"Meat"?

47
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:10,668
Yes, "meat." One syllable.

48
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:13,550
Thank you. Whose beer
am I about to drink?

49
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:15,009
Don't tell me.

50
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:17,345
Let's see, who's your type?

51
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:18,717
I don't see you
sitting quietly...

52
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:22,354
while he bloviates on his
postgrad thesis about Proust.

53
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:24,685
Uh-oh. Is that him?

54
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:26,048
Ironic hipster, so self-aware,

55
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:27,137
he makes everything a joke.

56
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:30,354
I prefer men who are
funny, not "funny."

57
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:33,406
What type are you?

58
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:34,908
Corn-fed, salt-of-the-earth
Missouri guy.

59
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:36,067
Missouri? Mmm-hmm.

60
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:37,151
Cute. Hmm.

61
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:38,286
Native New Yorker?

62
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:39,521
The world ends at the Hudson.

63
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:40,572
What's your name?

64
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:41,655
Amy.

65
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:44,042
Well, Amy, who are you?

66
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:48,417
A, I'm an award-winning
scrimshander.

67
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:52,630
B, I'm a moderately
influential warlord. Hmm.

68
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:55,922
C, I write personality
quizzes for magazines.

69
00:04:56,296 --> 00:05:00,392
Okay. Your hands are far too
delicate for real scrimshaw work...

70
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:03,679
and I happen to be a charter subscriber
to <i>Middling</i> Warlord Weekly...

71
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:05,062
so I'd recognize you.

72
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:06,605
I'm gonna go with

73
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:08,187
And you?

74
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:10,439
Who are you?

75
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:14,948
I'm the guy to save you
from all this awesomeness.

76
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:21,746
Oh, so, you write for
a men's magazine.

77
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:24,203
God, does that make you
an expert on being a man?

78
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:26,284
No.

79
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:28,357
It's what to wear,
what to drink.

80
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:30,254
How to bullshit.

81
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:31,881
Never with you.

82
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,418
Ha, ha. No, I mean it.

83
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:37,087
It's hard to believe you. Why?

84
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:38,756
I think it's your chin.

85
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:39,923
My chin?

86
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,639
Yeah, it's
quite villainous.

87
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:44,428
Okay, how's this?

88
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:48,602
A hundred percent
true, no bullshit.

89
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:49,808
Okay-

90
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:51,443
We <i>all</i> move to New York...

91
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:55,606
and we end up living in these little
cubby holes, and that's not it.

92
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:59,197
Come outside. Then,
you're in it.

93
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:03,405
You have to see this.

94
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:14,049
Hey-

95
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,676
I have to kiss you now.

96
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:26,140
Is that right?

97
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:29,477
I can't let you go through a
sugar storm unkissed. Hmm.

98
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:32,476
Oh. Wait a second.

99
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:36,654
There you go.

100
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,997
Nick Dunne...

101
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:53,839
I really like you.

102
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:02,256
So, is Amy gonna do one
of those anniversary...

103
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:04,386
treasure hunts?

104
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,426
You mean the forced march
designed to prove...

105
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:09,437
what an oblivious and uncaring
asshole her husband is?

106
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:10,688
Wow.

107
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:15,109
Life. I don't
remember the point.

108
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,362
Deep Hasbro thoughts.

109
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,863
Spin.

110
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,783
What was the clue last
year she got so mad about?

111
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:25,116
"When your poor
Amy has a cold...

112
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,871
"this dessert just
must be sold."

113
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:27,988
The answer?

114
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:29,704
I still don't know
the answer, Go.

115
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:30,833
A few years ago,
you'd have known.

116
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:31,910
A few years
ago, it was fun.

117
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:33,677
Year one, the traditional
gift was paper.

118
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:35,664
She got me a beautiful notebook.

119
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:37,124
Told me to go write my novel.

120
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:38,208
What did you get her?

121
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:39,459
A kite. Hmm.

122
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:41,469
She'd never flown a kite. Okay.

123
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,889
Anyway. Year
four, flowers.

124
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:48,302
She led me outside to the dying
rosebush in the backyard.

125
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:49,511
Ugh, that's symbolic.

126
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:50,641
Yeah.

127
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,063
What's the gift for five?

128
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,180
Wood.

129
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:54,224
So, what did you get her?

130
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:55,507
There's no good gift for wood.

131
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:58,778
I know! Go home, fuck her brains
out, slap her with your penis.

132
00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:00,405
"There's some wood
for you, bitch."

133
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:05,239
The Bar.

134
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:08,284
Why, yes. Hang on one second.

135
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:09,618
Hey, it's Watchful Wally.

136
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:13,910
Hey, Walt. What's going on?

137
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:16,204
Oh.

138
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:19,382
Thanks very much. I'll be right there.
All right, bye-bye.

139
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:34,268
Hey, buddy. What are
you doing out here?

140
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:36,975
Thanks, Walt!

141
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:54,034
Ame?

142
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:15,855
Amy!

143
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:29,152
Hello?

144
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:31,162
Come on in.

145
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:32,572
Hey-

146
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:34,036
Mister Dunne. Hi.

147
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:36,577
I'm Detective Rhonda Boney.
This is Officer James Gilpin.

148
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:38,663
We understand there are
concerns about your wife.

149
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:40,463
I don't know where my wife is.

150
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,666
And I came home to this.

151
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:46,507
Now, I don't panic easily...

152
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,930
but it's weird, right?

153
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:52,221
Mind if we look around? Please.

154
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,509
How long have
you two been here?

155
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:56,395
Two years in September. We
used to live in New York.

156
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:57,555
City?

157
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,684
Yeah, I was a writer.
We were both writers.

158
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,352
Why did you all move back here?

159
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,021
My mom got sick.

160
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:07,031
Oh, I'm sorry. How is she?

161
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,533
She's dead.

162
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:09,692
I'm so sorry.

163
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:17,704
What do you do now, for work?

164
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:20,419
My sister Margo and I
own The Bar downtown.

165
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,588
Oh, The Bar.

166
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:24,875
Love the name. Very meta.

167
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,133
Thanks.

168
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:30,885
Pretty things.

169
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:36,852
Stay.

170
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:38,763
My office, here.

171
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:43,856
Beautiful dress.

172
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:49,950
Date night? It's
our anniversary.

173
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:51,025
Hmm.

174
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:54,613
It's a guest
bedroom, there.

175
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,406
Cat's room on the end.

176
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:58,120
I checked up here.

177
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:03,454
This is the kitchen...

178
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:04,964
obviously.

179
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:22,440
This is my wife's office.

180
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:24,226
Amy's office.

181
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:40,208
Wow. Impressive gal.

182
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:41,538
Yeah. Should I be concerned?

183
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:42,665
I remember these.

184
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:45,289
I loved these books.

185
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:50,756
Wait a minute.

186
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:52,921
Your wife is Amazing Amy?

187
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:55,723
Yeah. She is.

188
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:57,509
Wow.

189
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:04,016
<i>Amazing-fucking-Amy is
getting fucking married.</i>

190
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:05,855
<i>That's how the night started.</i>

191
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:09,112
<i>With me, regular,
flawed, real Amy,</i>

192
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:11,940
<i>jealous, as always,
of the golden child.</i>

193
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:14,651
<i>Perfect, brilliant, Amazing Amy,</i>

194
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,736
<i>who's getting fucking married.</i>

195
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,743
When I was 10, I quit cello.

196
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:22,500
In the next book, Amazing
Amy became a prodigy.

197
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:25,745
Did you play volleyball?

198
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,747
I got cut, freshman year.

199
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:30,383
She made varsity.

200
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:33,128
When did you have a dog?

201
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:34,295
She got the dog.

202
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:37,299
Puddles made her more relatable.

203
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:38,682
Wow.

204
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:40,843
I love your parents...

205
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,683
but they really can be assholes.

206
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:44,188
Nick! Sir!

207
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:46,850
Hey, thanks for coming, man.
No problem.

208
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,438
Hey, sweetheart.

209
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,315
Big night for your mom.

210
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:54,199
It would mean so much if you
would talk to a few reporters...

211
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:56,109
bloggers, give them
a little Amy color.

212
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:58,028
People wanna hear from you.

213
00:12:58,194 --> 00:12:59,696
We can't stay long. Fantastic.

214
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:02,035
Fifteen minutes, tops.

215
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:04,459
This is why I have
my brownstone.

216
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:06,536
My trust fund. I know
I can't complain.

217
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:09,206
Your parents literally
plagiarized your childhood.

218
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:11,215
No, they improved upon it...

219
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,293
and then peddled
it to the masses.

220
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,553
I thought you were gonna wear
white to match the wedding theme.

221
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:17,055
I thought that would be creepy.

222
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,557
"if it's worth doing,
it's worth doing..."

223
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:21,935
Hold up! I know how this ends.
Don't tell me.

224
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:23,766
You're very cute, Nick.

225
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:25,568
Amy, you know what would
make Dad's night.

226
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:27,223
Oh, I'm on it.

227
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:31,395
I love having strangers
pick at my scabs.

228
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:32,687
<i>I'm
curious whether...</i>

229
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:34,902
it's difficult for you to see
Amazing Amy heading down the aisle.

230
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:37,908
And this big party celebrating
this fictional wedding.

231
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:40,286
Because it's my understanding
you are not married.

232
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:42,118
Is that correct?

233
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:44,072
Correct.

234
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:46,709
Amazing Amy has always
been one step ahead of me.

235
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:50,714
Excuse me. I'm sorry, I
just have a few questions.

236
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:51,877
It's you.

237
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,589
I'm here in a strictly
journalistic capacity.

238
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:56,503
Now, you had the
distinct pleasure...

239
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:58,088
of dating Nick Dunne
for how long?

240
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:00,928
Two magical years.

241
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,808
In the course of that time,
you've had the opportunity...

242
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:05,311
to perform such
gracious gestures as...

243
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:09,270
not correcting Nick when he
pronounced "quinoa" as "kween-o-a."

244
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:10,775
An understandable mistake.

245
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:12,133
He also thought it was a fish.

246
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:13,736
He thinks Velveeta is a cheese.

247
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:16,944
You also manage to appear
shocked and delighted...

248
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:19,626
when Nick's elderly mother breaks
into an impromptu rendition...

249
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:21,828
of New York, New York,
every time she sees you.

250
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,909
<i>These
bag of bone shoes</i>

251
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:25,119
That's just frightening.

252
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,784
You also bought Nick his
very first pair of scissors.

253
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,497
And matching stapler.

254
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,459
Amy Elliott, you are
more than amazing.

255
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:36,001
You are brilliant, yet
entirely un-snobby.

256
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:39,671
You challenge me.
You surprise me.

257
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:41,180
And, fun fact for the readers...

258
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:43,307
you have a world-class vagina.

259
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:48,438
My colleagues tell me that
you are not yet married.

260
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:50,644
Is that correct?

261
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:52,150
I'm not.

262
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,651
Isn't it time we fixed that?

263
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:56,650
And then...

264
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:59,657
<i>the night wasn't so bad anymore.</i>

265
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:18,376
And it's done. Crossed
off the list.

266
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:20,511
Now, normally, we would
not treat this...

267
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,384
as a missing persons
case so quick...

268
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:23,947
but given the scene
at your house...

269
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:26,008
and given our spike in
violent crime of late...

270
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,519
we are gonna take this
very, very seriously.

271
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:29,636
Okay. Good.

272
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:31,602
We've got forensics
over at your place.

273
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:32,853
You got somewhere to stay?

274
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,483
I could stay at my sister's.
Okay.

275
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,815
We're tracking Amy's
phone, her credit cards.

276
00:15:36,978 --> 00:15:38,578
We will organize
searches, put up flyers.

277
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:40,281
We're gonna hold a press
conference tomorrow.

278
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:41,636
You're having a
press conference?

279
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:43,279
I wanna get the word out, right?

280
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,282
Yeah, it's just all
of a sudden...

281
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:47,614
I feel like I'm on a
Law & <i>Order</i> episode.

282
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:57,753
Time is of the essence
in these cases.

283
00:15:57,915 --> 00:16:00,543
But, that said, do you wanna
wait and call a lawyer?

284
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:01,711
Absolutely not. I
just wanna help.

285
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:03,551
So, you and Amy have
been here two years.

286
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:06,842
You tend bar... I own The Bar.

287
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:10,387
And I teach creative
writing at MVCC.

288
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:12,226
No kids? Not yet.

289
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:13,731
So, what does Amy do most days?

290
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:16,109
A woman with all those
degrees, what does she do?

291
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:17,898
I don't know. She keeps busy.

292
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,562
Doing what?

293
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:23,274
She's a voracious reader.

294
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:26,285
So, she's always got
a book in her hand.

295
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:28,704
Well, days can get long.

296
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:32,584
I know a few housewives, that evening
glass of wine starts coming at noon.

297
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:33,914
Or prescription pills.

298
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,453
Just last week,
we had a soccer mom.

299
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,964
Nice lady. Got her teeth
kicked in over some OxyContin.

300
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:40,090
Ever since that mall went bust,
half the town is out of work.

301
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:41,592
We cannot keep up with
the drug violence.

302
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:44,090
I'm pretty sure that's not it.

303
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:45,846
Has Amy got friends
we can talk to?

304
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:47,048
Um...

305
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,262
No, not really.

306
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:51,268
No friends? This whole town?

307
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:54,931
She was very close with my
mom, before she passed away.

308
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:57,217
You know, we have a pretty
serious homeless problem...

309
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:58,392
in our neighborhood.

310
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:00,486
I think maybe you guys
should check that out.

311
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:02,647
We'll look into that.

312
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:05,316
You got to The Bar
around 11:00 today.

313
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:06,951
Where were you before that?
Just to cross that out.

314
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,027
Well, I was home.

315
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,613
I left at 9:30, I got a cup
of coffee, a newspaper.

316
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,380
I went to Sawyer Beach
and read the news.

317
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,496
Did you visit with anyone there?

318
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:16,627
I kind of go to Sawyer
Beach for the solitude.

319
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:20,256
So, your wife has
no friends here.

320
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:22,132
Is she kinda standoffish?

321
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,589
Ivy League? Rubs
people the wrong way?

322
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:26,971
She's from New York. Oh.

323
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:30,550
She's complicated. She's
got very high standards.

324
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:31,634
Type A?

325
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:34,437
That can make you crazy
if you're not like that.

326
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:36,063
You seem pretty laid-back.

327
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:37,310
Type B.

328
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,646
Speaking of which,
Amy's blood type?

329
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:41,857
God, I don't know. I'd have
to look it up at the house.

330
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:43,419
You don't know if
she has friends...

331
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:44,689
you don't know what
she does all day...

332
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:46,653
and you don't know your
wife's blood type.

333
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:47,942
Sure you all are married?

334
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:50,532
Uh... Maybe it's type O.

335
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:52,789
Where are her folks?
New York? Yeah.

336
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:54,540
Can they get here time for this
press conference tomorrow?

337
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:56,699
Tomorrow? I have no idea.
I haven't talked to them.

338
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:58,502
You haven't called your
wife's parents yet?

339
00:17:58,661 --> 00:17:59,787
You can't get a signal
in this building.

340
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:00,962
I've been in here
talking to you.

341
00:18:01,122 --> 00:18:03,466
Call them, please, Nick. Now.

342
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:04,841
Fine.

343
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,262
Should I know my
wife's blood type?

344
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:13,342
No.

345
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:17,351
I apologize, Marybeth. I
didn't know what was going on.

346
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:18,890
Now I'm at the station...

347
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:20,433
and the cops are at the house,

348
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,564
and it's serious and
I'm calling you.

349
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:26,113
There's a lot of things that
are being juggled right now.

350
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:29,401
I'm standing right next to
Detective Rhonda Boney...

351
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:31,535
who's the lead investigator
on this and she's...

352
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,952
My mother-in-law would
like to speak with you.

353
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:38,538
This is Detective Boney.

354
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:39,918
I wanna go home.

355
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:42,421
I don't know why I
have to be here.

356
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:45,083
I don't wanna be here.
I wanna go home.

357
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:46,375
Dad?

358
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,260
This is my father.
What's going on?

359
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:49,466
Really? You're Nick Dunne?

360
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:51,589
We've been trying to get a
hold of you all afternoon.

361
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:53,396
I've been right there.
My wife is missing.

362
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:54,467
Bitch. Don't.

363
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:56,887
Your father wandered out of
Comfort Hill after lunch.

364
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:59,306
We found him walking
Route 79, disoriented.

365
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:00,815
We've been trying to
call you for the last...

366
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,099
I don't get a cell
signal in this building.

367
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:04,234
I've been sitting 20
feet away from you.

368
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,160
Sir, please don't take
that tone with me.

369
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,229
Stupid, dumb, ugly bitch.

370
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:08,943
Dad, stop.

371
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:12,826
You wanna drive him home?

372
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:15,784
I think that would be wise.
Thanks.

373
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:38,436
<i>This voice
mailbox is currently full.</i>

374
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:40,262
Fuck.

375
00:19:42,473 --> 00:19:44,942
Oh, get your fucking
hands off me.

376
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:46,478
Thanks.

377
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:03,331
<i>Everyone told us and
told us and told us...</i>

378
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:05,963
<i>marriage is hard work.</i>

379
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:09,046
<i>And compromise and more work.</i>

380
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,336
<i>"Abandon all hope,

381

"she wandered here..."

<i>Well, it's not true.
Not for me and Nick.</i>

384
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:20,887
"...in search of Jane."

00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,977
<i>With us, two years...</i>

00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,645
<i>it's just good.</i>

387
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:28,645
Austen. Hmm.

388
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:33,483
You were an alienated teen and only
Elizabeth Bennet understood you.

389
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:35,985
Look at that.

390
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,493
My God.

391
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:40,869
You naughty minx.

392
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:44,001
Well, technically, we are supposed
to fuck at the next stop.

393
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,662
Yeah, in keeping with tradition.

394
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:49,207
But I might be willing to
bend the rules this once.

395
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:51,091
God bless Jane Austen.

396
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:08,025
I'm enthusiastic.

397
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,444
Look at that. It's
confirmed by the...

398
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:15,695
Oh, thank you.

399
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:18,202
Year two. Cotton.

400
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:29,080
We had that joke that our sex
was too good for ordinary.

401
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:31,715
So, these are 2,000
thread-count...

402
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:38,381
We're so cute.

403
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:39,624
I wanna punch us in the face.

404
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:42,935
That's pretty great. I mean,
that is pretty great.

405
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:45,729
Did they ask if
you wanted a lawyer?

406
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:48,061
I don't need a lawyer.
Here, I'll do this.

407
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,400
Well, did they ask
personal stuff about Amy?

408
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:51,731
You know, they asked...

409
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:54,280
why didn't she have any friends?
What did you say?

410
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:56,440
I said she was complicated.
Nick!

411
00:21:57,441 --> 00:22:00,069
Everyone knows "complicated" is
code for "bitch."

412
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,163
Oh, God. I feel sick.

413
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,748
Thanks.

414
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:10,917
It's so bizarre.

415
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,458
It seems like the kind of thing
that would happen to Amy.

416
00:22:13,624 --> 00:22:14,671
She always attracts...

417
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:16,427
Drama?

418
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:18,505
You can say it. It's
just me and you.

419
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:21,094
Just because I don't
like to be around Amy...

420
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:22,657
doesn't mean I don't
care about her.

421
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:27,767
Anyway, whoever took her is
bound to bring her back.

422
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:39,029
Detective? Excuse me.

423
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:41,819
I'm Noelle Hawthorne.
I'm Amy's best friend.

424
00:22:42,945 --> 00:22:45,619
Well, great. Where
do you live, Noelle?

425
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:47,533
Five doors down. 1032.

426
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,794
Wonderful. I would
love to talk to you.

427
00:22:49,952 --> 00:22:51,704
Can I come by in half an hour?

428
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:53,464
Y'all know anything yet?
I'm sorry.

429
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:55,044
I got guys on the clock in here.

430
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:56,296
But you give me 30 minutes.

431
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:57,801
But that's usually bath time.

432
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:01,138
Well, we'll talk in
between shampoos.

433
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:05,123
All right. So, what do you got?

434
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:07,845
It was definitely blood spatter
you saw in the kitchen.

435
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:09,892
Normally, kitchen,
knives, food prep.

436
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,308
Not that weird, but
that is awfully high.

437
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:13,976
So, I'm gonna order
a luminol sweep.

438
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:15,269
Well, okay.

439
00:23:17,688 --> 00:23:18,985
Mmm, interesting.

440
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:20,149
What's that?

441
00:23:20,316 --> 00:23:22,535
House is rented in her name.

442
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:23,702
Car's in her name.

443
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:26,865
Credit cards, utilities,
phone bill, all in her name.

444
00:23:27,031 --> 00:23:28,749
Even his bar's in her name.

445
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:30,706
I don't know that
that's so surprising.

446
00:23:30,868 --> 00:23:32,370
No. But it is humiliating.

447
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:33,453
What you got?

448
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:36,339
It's with her unmentionables.

449
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:51,556
Well, we have our first clue.

450
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:04,197
I have to take a shower.

451
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,033
No, don't. You've
been up all night.

452
00:24:06,195 --> 00:24:08,368
You wanna look like you've
been up all night.

453
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:12,209
Hey, be careful today, okay?

454
00:24:12,368 --> 00:24:13,585
That's a weird thing to say.

455
00:24:13,744 --> 00:24:15,621
Well, when you're
upset, you bottle up.

456
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:17,377
You can seem angry, like...

457
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:18,916
Please don't say, "Like Dad."

458
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:20,630
Or else you swing into your
momma's-boy charm offensive...

459
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:22,632
and that can feel glib. Perfect.

460
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:25,339
I'll balance on the exact fucking
edge of your emotional razor.

461
00:24:25,506 --> 00:24:27,224
Okay. Just be...

462
00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:29,181
Myself?

463
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:31,562
<i>...sponsoring</i> a
<i>raffle to benefit West County</i> 4H...

464
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:35,065
<i>and raffling season tickets
for Mizzou football.</i>

465
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:38,524
<i>Buy your tickets at the Wing Hut
or local Tri-State Tire stores.</i>

466
00:24:43,107 --> 00:24:44,450
Your in-laws made it.

467
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:47,277
Hi, Rand. Hey, man.

468
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:48,361
I'm Detective Boney.

469
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:50,247
I'm the twin. Margo.

470
00:24:50,406 --> 00:24:51,999
We played tennis
yesterday, Nick.

471
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:53,371
I just can't get over it.

472
00:24:53,534 --> 00:24:54,751
Marybeth, I am really sorry.

473
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,670
I knew you never should
have moved back here.

474
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:57,746
We didn't have a lot of choice.

475
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:01,463
We are all worried.
We are all scared.

476
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:03,298
But we are all here now.

477
00:25:03,377 --> 00:25:06,096
And we will find Amy, together.

478
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:18,104
Should I just go first, and then
you guys can say something?

479
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:19,226
Good.

480
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:25,115
As you know, my wife,
Amy Elliott Dunne...

481
00:25:25,274 --> 00:25:28,073
disappeared from our home on
the morning of July 5th...

482
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:31,451
under suspicious circumstances.

483
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:32,956
Louder!

484
00:25:33,115 --> 00:25:37,370
If anyone out there, uh,
has any information...

485
00:25:37,578 --> 00:25:39,797
please come forward.

486
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:41,582
Thank you.

487
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:46,636
I'm Rand Elliott. My
wife, Marybeth Elliott.

488
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:47,887
Should I have said my name?

489
00:25:48,464 --> 00:25:50,307
Amy is our only child.

490
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:54,471
She's bright, she's beautiful.
She's kind.

491
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,472
She really is Amazing Amy.

492
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:59,399
You know, there are millions
of people out there...

493
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:01,981
who grew up with her
and care about her.

494
00:26:02,144 --> 00:26:04,772
We care about her, we love her.

495
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:08,075
And we just want her back.

496
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:12,488
Amy is a decorated scholar.

497
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:15,498
She forged a successful
career in journalism.

498
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:17,830
She returned here to her
husband's hometown...

499
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:20,337
and she made a life
in her adopted home.

500
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,666
Now, Amy needs your help.

501
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:27,837
We're establishing a volunteer
headquarters at the Drury Lodge.

502
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:33,351
We have a hotline,
1-855-4-AMY-TIPS.

503
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:39,019
And our website is
wvvw.FindAmazingAmy.com.

504
00:26:39,515 --> 00:26:41,438
- Mr. Dunne!
- Mr. Elliott!

505
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,851
Mr. Dunne,
any signs of foul play?

506
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:50,113
Mr. Elliott, when was the last
time you spoke to your daughter?

507
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:52,611
Smile.

508
00:26:59,201 --> 00:27:00,794
That's all for now. Thank you.

509
00:27:03,372 --> 00:27:06,091
Amy is the kind of
girl who attracts admirers.

510
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:08,218
Right, Nick? Yeah, definitely.

511
00:27:08,377 --> 00:27:10,755
And we've had instances...

512
00:27:10,921 --> 00:27:12,844
where things got... Scary.

513
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:14,349
Do you know about Desi Collings?

514
00:27:14,508 --> 00:27:16,055
Yeah, I know all
about Desi Collings.

515
00:27:16,218 --> 00:27:17,344
He was obsessed.

516
00:27:17,511 --> 00:27:20,731
He attempted suicide after Amy
broke up with him sophomore year.

517
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:22,311
We had to file a
restraining order.

518
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:24,727
This would be high school?
Twenty years ago?

519
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:26,486
But he recently moved to St.
Louis.

520
00:27:26,562 --> 00:27:27,984
That's just two hours away.

521
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:29,899
To be fair, he is from St.
Louis.

522
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:31,567
We also have Tommy O'Hara.

523
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:33,827
This is only eight years
ago, in New York.

524
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:36,159
She broke up with him,
he got very physical.

525
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:37,868
What was the charge?

526
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:39,999
Sexual assault, threat,
battery, what?

527
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,002
I only know it was bad.

528
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:43,834
Okay.

529
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:45,373
Thank you.

530
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:47,253
Uh, anything more recent?

531
00:27:50,586 --> 00:27:52,588
Not that I know of.

532
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:57,972
Hey, Nick? You got a minute?

533
00:27:59,136 --> 00:28:00,763
Yeah.

534
00:28:06,143 --> 00:28:07,395
Imagine our confusion.

535
00:28:07,561 --> 00:28:08,608
A missing persons case...

536
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:09,987
and in your wife's
dressing room...

537
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:11,383
we find an envelope
marked "clue."

538
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:13,526
That's for our anniversary.

539
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:15,865
My wife does these
treasure hunts.

540
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:18,281
I'm hoping you can tell
me what this means.

541
00:28:18,447 --> 00:28:19,448
You want to solve
Amy's treasure hunt?

542
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:22,185
It'll help me track Amy's
movements before she disappeared.

543
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:24,457
Of course. Okay.

544
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:27,214
"Although this spot
couldn't be tighter...

545
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:30,675
"it's a cozy room for
my favorite writer."

546
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:34,720
I know this one!

547
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:38,718
<i>Although this spot
couldn't be any tighter...</i>

548
00:28:39,343 --> 00:28:42,142
<i>it's a cozy room for
my favorite writer.</i>

549
00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:46,939
<i>After-school meeting,
don't mind if I do.</i>

550
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:50,024
<i>Maybe I'll teach you
a thing or two.</i>

551
00:28:54,066 --> 00:28:56,285
Well, well. What does it say?

552
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:57,945
Clue two.

553
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:02,450
"Hey, handsome man,
let's go undercover.

554
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:06,830
"You'll be the spy, and
I'll be his lover.

555
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:08,247
"Let's head on over...

556
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:10,165
"to the little brown house.

557
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:14,053
"We'll play hot, doting
husband, sweet, loving spouse."

558
00:29:16,797 --> 00:29:17,844
These yours?

559
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,591
No.

560
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,101
But you read the first clue.

561
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:24,264
Randy professor,
naughty student.

562
00:29:24,346 --> 00:29:25,347
I blush.

563
00:29:25,514 --> 00:29:27,266
Me and my ex just swapped cards.

564
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:29,755
Where's this little brown house?

565
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:31,395
I have no idea.

566
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:15,981
Hello?

567
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:18,525
Nicholas Dunne.

568
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:22,287
Under my
father's name, William Dunne.

569
00:30:28,702 --> 00:30:30,500
My wife's first pet?
Is this necessary?

570
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:32,673
Can you just turn the bell...

571
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:33,749
Yeah, I know.

572
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,800
It's, uh... It's, uh...

573
00:30:36,585 --> 00:30:37,837
Uh...

574
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,217
It's "Puddles," right?
Or is it "Poodles?"

575
00:30:44,134 --> 00:30:45,761
We're good.

576
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:48,347
Hello, stranger.

577
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:50,515
Fancy meeting you here.

578
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,855
It's your dad's house, right?

579
00:30:53,018 --> 00:30:55,441
Are you following me?
What you doing?

580
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:57,652
Like you said, it's
my dad's house.

581
00:30:57,814 --> 00:31:00,533
I come by once a week, make sure
the place hasn't burned down.

582
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:03,616
But it looks okay.

583
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:06,240
I'll walk you out.

584
00:31:09,493 --> 00:31:10,870
You know...

585
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:14,165
I thought maybe this was
the little brown house.

586
00:31:14,331 --> 00:31:15,423
From the clue.

587
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:17,550
Nope. Still blue.

588
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:38,113
<i>Picture me, I'm a
girl who's very, very bad.</i>

589
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:41,992
<i>I need to be punished, and
by "punished," I mean "had."</i>

590
00:31:42,484 --> 00:31:45,613
<i>It's where you keep goodies
for anniversary five.</i>

591
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:49,659
"So open the door,
and look alive."

592
00:31:50,951 --> 00:31:51,998
Bitch!

593
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:58,709
<i>Want to test your
marriage for weak spots?</i>

594
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:00,844
<i>Add one recession...</i>

595
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:02,466
<i>subtract two jobs.</i>

596
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:05,048
<i>It's surprisingly effective.</i>

597
00:32:05,215 --> 00:32:07,513
Promise me we'll
never be like them.

598
00:32:07,676 --> 00:32:08,677
Like who?

599
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:10,471
All those awful couples we know.

600
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:14,483
Those wives who treat their
men like dancing monkeys...

601
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:16,109
to be trained and paraded.

602
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:19,445
Husbands who treat their wives
like the highway patrol...

603
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:22,407
to be out-foxed and avoided.

604
00:32:27,154 --> 00:32:28,827
I think I'm gonna be laid off.

605
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:32,288
We're in a recession. If it
happens, we'll deal with it.

606
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:34,545
I'll probably be next.

607
00:32:34,703 --> 00:32:35,955
We have each other.

608
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:38,878
Everything else is
background noise.

609
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,756
You are exceptional.

610
00:32:49,468 --> 00:32:50,720
My turn.

611
00:32:52,596 --> 00:32:54,269
My parents' publisher
dropped them...

612
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:55,815
and they're in debt
up to their ears.

613
00:32:55,891 --> 00:32:56,892
That's terrible.

614
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:59,273
And they need to borrow
from my trust fund.

615
00:32:59,436 --> 00:33:00,813
How much?

616
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:03,198
Almost a million.

617
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:05,241
That's almost all of it.

618
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,528
This is where you say, "Everything
else is background noise."

619
00:33:07,611 --> 00:33:08,658
Amy, if you're laid off...

620
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:10,071
and I'm laid off...

621
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:11,239
I said I'd do it.

622
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:12,532
Without talking to me?

623
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:14,167
Well, it's... Your call.

624
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:15,919
Their money, technically.

625
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:22,005
You know what? You're right.

626
00:33:22,626 --> 00:33:24,628
Everything else is
just background noise.

627
00:33:33,595 --> 00:33:34,596
Hey-

628
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:39,772
More games?

629
00:33:39,935 --> 00:33:41,528
Yeah, I just wanted
to shoot some folks.

630
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:44,239
What's the laptop for?

631
00:33:45,315 --> 00:33:46,316
Laptop-ing.

632
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:49,368
Oh, I see.

633
00:33:49,528 --> 00:33:52,532
You can give your parents
$879,000 without talking to me...

634
00:33:53,073 --> 00:33:54,473
but God forbid I buy
a video game...

635
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:55,580
without getting your permission.

636
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:56,743
You are spending a lot.

637
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:58,954
You don't trust me. You
don't trust my judgment.

638
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,542
You certainly don't
trust my intention.

639
00:34:00,622 --> 00:34:01,702
What are you talking about?

640
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:03,208
That's the basic tenet
of a prenup, isn't it?

641
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:05,503
Why are you throwing
that in my face again?

642
00:34:05,669 --> 00:34:07,922
Because it's easy to throw.
Nick, I don't get it.

643
00:34:08,088 --> 00:34:09,886
I don't get why
you're daring me...

644
00:34:09,965 --> 00:34:11,308
to be someone I don't wanna be.

645
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:14,436
The nagging shrew. The
controlling bitch.

646
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:16,847
I'm not that person. I'm your wife.

647
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:18,060
I'm sorry.

648
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:20,543
I just don't know how to do this.
I've never not had a job.

649
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,477
I flipped burgers,
I painted houses.

650
00:34:22,644 --> 00:34:24,646
You'll get another job.

651
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:30,284
Hi, Go.

652
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:33,655
What? Hold on. What?

653
00:34:33,822 --> 00:34:35,119
<i>And suddenly...
Slow</i> down, what is <i>it?</i>

654
00:34:35,282 --> 00:34:37,202
<i>I knew everything
was about to get worse.</i>

655
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:38,918
Okay, tell me what's wrong.

656
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:07,773
Bless you, Nick. Father.

657
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,737
Hey, Tom. Mayor!

658
00:35:09,899 --> 00:35:10,991
Nick, good to see you.

659
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:12,068
Good to see you.

660
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:13,487
Hey, guys, hey-

661
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:17,407
Jodie. Nick.

662
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:21,836
Oh, we'll find her. Mmm-hmm.

663
00:35:35,717 --> 00:35:37,310
You look like hammered shit.

664
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:39,142
Oh, thank you.

665
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:48,948
You ever see that guy
in the glasses before?

666
00:35:49,606 --> 00:35:51,153
Don't worry. We
videotape everybody...

667
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:52,233
that comes in and out
of these things.

668
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,027
I mean, you tend
to get a lot of...

669
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:55,157
Do-gooders?

670
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,412
Freaks.

671
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:58,414
Hey, I meant to ask you.

672
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:00,746
Noelle Hawthorne?

673
00:36:00,909 --> 00:36:02,629
She lives on your street.
Amy's best friend.

674
00:36:03,745 --> 00:36:04,962
I've never heard the
name Noelle Hawthorne.

675
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:07,169
She and her husband
have triplets.

676
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:08,424
Oh.

677
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:11,469
Yeah, we might say hi
to them on the street.

678
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:13,964
But "best friend"? No.

679
00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:16,209
Excuse me, one sec.

680
00:36:20,053 --> 00:36:22,021
He acted like Noelle was
a complete stranger.

681
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,272
Of course he did.

682
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,812
Look, these two are yours.

683
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:27,227
Oh, look. He's being
a good guy...

684
00:36:27,394 --> 00:36:29,192
so everybody can see
him being a good guy.

685
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:31,027
Oh, you really don't
like him, do you?

686
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:32,691
What's to like?

687
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:56,723
<i>This
mailbox is currently full.</i>

688
00:36:56,798 --> 00:36:57,890
<i>Press one to...</i>

689
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:01,428
Nick? I just wanted to introduce myself.
My name's Shawna Kelly.

690
00:37:01,678 --> 00:37:04,272
I am so sorry for your troubles.

691
00:37:04,431 --> 00:37:06,684
Thank you. That's kind. Are
you remembering to eat?

692
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:07,851
Well, a lot of cold cuts.

693
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:12,067
I'm gonna fix you up my
world-famous chicken Frito pie.

694
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,710
That's very kind and
very unnecessary.

695
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:15,400
You have to keep your strength.

696
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:16,906
Would you...

697
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:19,696
say, "Chicken Frito
pie!"

698
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:23,829
Um...

699
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:25,205
You know what?

700
00:37:26,453 --> 00:37:27,705
Would you delete
that picture for me?

701
00:37:27,871 --> 00:37:29,623
It's a nice photo. I know it is.

702
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:31,086
But just do me a favor.

703
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:32,876
Will you?

704
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:35,841
Would you go ahead and
please delete that picture?

705
00:37:36,004 --> 00:37:37,004
You just press...

706
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:38,423
What is wrong with you?

707
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:39,762
Could you please not
share that with anyone?

708
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:43,269
I will share it with
whomever I please.

709
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:48,308
Dude. Yeah?

710
00:37:48,475 --> 00:37:49,818
Marybeth is pissed.

711
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:51,318
Why?

712
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:55,657
Marybeth?

713
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:59,240
It's like you're the
goddamn Homecoming King.

714
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:03,998
It was important to my
mother that I be polite...

715
00:38:04,157 --> 00:38:05,955
I be considerate,
I be a gentleman.

716
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:07,710
It looked like you
were having fun.

717
00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:10,122
l am
in a nightmare!

718
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:13,128
All I'm trying to
do is be nice...

719
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:17,012
to the people who are
volunteering to help find Amy.

720
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:20,715
You're right.

721
00:38:21,591 --> 00:38:23,559
And I'm sorry.

722
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:29,183
My God, this place literally
smells like feces.

723
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:43,371
In your searches, did you find
any golf clubs, real fancy?

724
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:44,952
No.

725
00:38:46,074 --> 00:38:47,667
How about a brand
new Stratocaster?

726
00:38:47,826 --> 00:38:48,952
No, nothing like that.

727
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:51,755
Well, all right.

728
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:59,675
How big's that TV?
It's not 65-inch.

729
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:01,010
No, it's nowhere near that.

730
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:02,264
Okay-

731
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:04,012
Kibble? Excuse me?

732
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:06,143
He asked me to feed his cat.

733
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:07,519
Oh, I saw some in the pantry.

734
00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:12,477
Detective Boney, Officer Gilpin?
Noelle Hawthorne!

735
00:39:12,642 --> 00:39:14,110
I know y'all are in there!

736
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:16,442
Would you please escort
Miss Hawthorne...

737
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:18,774
and her children back
out to the street?

738
00:39:19,649 --> 00:39:21,617
Detective Boney!

739
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:25,622
Just remind her it is a
possible crime scene.

740
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:36,799
<i>Look at that pie-eating grin...</i>

741
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:39,173
<i>from a guy whose
wife is missing.</i>

742
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:46,559
How are you doing? Terrific.

743
00:39:48,303 --> 00:39:49,680
How's Marybeth?

744
00:39:49,846 --> 00:39:51,564
She's a wreck.

745
00:39:51,723 --> 00:39:53,191
And you?

746
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:55,310
Awesome.

747
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:56,394
Hey...

748
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:58,070
have you told me everything?

749
00:39:58,313 --> 00:40:00,156
Of course. Everything?

750
00:40:00,315 --> 00:40:01,515
Why would you even ask me that?

751
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:05,700
Ever since you walked into The Bar that
morning Amy went missing, you seem...

752
00:40:06,988 --> 00:40:07,989
off. I am off.

753
00:40:09,032 --> 00:40:12,252
Everybody's examining me and
projecting their shit on me.

754
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:15,710
All I want is to come over
here, have a beer with you...

755
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:17,089
and not be judged.

756
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:18,750
Can we do that?

757
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:21,177
Of course.

758
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:24,422
You know what I keep thinking?

759
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:25,590
If Mom were here?

760
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:29,098
Yeah. Like I'm 12.

761
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:33,352
Nick, Mom would fix it.

762
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:43,783
I'm gonna go Benadryl
myself to sleep.

763
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:49,038
Love you. Love you.

764
00:40:53,368 --> 00:40:55,291
<i>So, here's</i> a
<i>strange, new sentence.</i>

765
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:58,923
<i>I am a Missourian.</i>

766
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:07,097
Mmm, bye, Dad.

767
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:12,353
<i>No money, no
jobs, no prospects.</i>

768
00:41:12,512 --> 00:41:14,560
<i>And then, we heard from Go.</i>

769
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:16,520
Mama Maureen...

770
00:41:16,683 --> 00:41:19,527
<i>Stage 4 breast cancer.</i>

771
00:41:21,688 --> 00:41:24,407
<i>So, we moved to Missouri.</i>

772
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:26,067
<i>I don't mind.</i>

773
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:29,408
<i>I just wish he'd asked.</i>

774
00:41:41,082 --> 00:41:43,426
<i>Nick is happy to be home.</i>

775
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:46,087
<i>But I don't know if he's
happy I'm with him.</i>

776
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:50,717
<i>I feel like something
he loaded by mistake.</i>

777
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:53,932
<i>Something to be
jettisoned, if necessary.</i>

778
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:56,314
<i>Something disposable.</i>

779
00:41:58,141 --> 00:42:00,769
<i>I feel like I could disappear.</i>

780
00:42:44,771 --> 00:42:46,648
Oh, my God!

781
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:48,657
I saw you on TV. Okay.

782
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:50,363
It's so crazy. Yeah, I know.

783
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:52,620
She just vanished?
She's just gone.

784
00:42:52,779 --> 00:42:54,497
I've been so worried about you.
Where have you been?

785
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:56,373
I called you a hundred times.
You gotta pick up your phone!

786
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:58,534
Rehearsals. What?

787
00:42:58,701 --> 00:42:59,998
<i>Godspell.</i>

788
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:03,297
My sister's
asleep in the other room.

789
00:43:03,456 --> 00:43:04,457
I needed to see you.

790
00:43:04,624 --> 00:43:06,171
I know this is a bad idea.

791
00:43:06,334 --> 00:43:07,774
Can you at least
tell me you love me?

792
00:43:07,877 --> 00:43:11,507
I do love you, but we have to
be really careful right now.

793
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:12,798
Oh, I've been so scared.

794
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:14,057
Between rehearsals?

795
00:43:14,217 --> 00:43:15,844
You told me I needed
to have my own life.

796
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:17,387
I know.

797
00:43:17,553 --> 00:43:18,679
We need to stop.

798
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:20,018
I need you.

799
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,983
Touch me.

800
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:29,023
Stop it. Come here.

801
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:31,992
Sit down.

802
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:33,368
Okay-

803
00:43:33,528 --> 00:43:37,499
Did you, by any chance, tell
anybody anything about us?

804
00:43:37,657 --> 00:43:39,034
Even in texting, or on Facebook.

805
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,874
Facebook? I use the
disposable phone.

806
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:43,834
You buy my presents in cash.
I'm not stupid, Nick.

807
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:46,749
I know, sweetie. Did you leave a
pair of red panties in my office?

808
00:43:46,916 --> 00:43:50,216
I don't know. Maybe.
They better be mine.

809
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:51,336
Sweetheart, think.

810
00:43:51,379 --> 00:43:53,723
I don't know. I'd have to
check my red panty inventory.

811
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:56,384
Andie, I need you to take
this seriously, okay?

812
00:43:56,551 --> 00:43:58,224
This is the last time we're
gonna see each other, until...

813
00:43:58,386 --> 00:43:59,854
Until when?

814
00:44:00,388 --> 00:44:01,731
Until it's safe.

815
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:03,357
You were going to get a divorce.

816
00:44:03,516 --> 00:44:05,564
Never say that out loud again.

817
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:08,400
Okay. I'm sorry.

818
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:10,235
I don't wanna fight.

819
00:44:12,275 --> 00:44:13,743
I just wanna be with you.

820
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:15,073
Andie, oh, please...

821
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:17,576
That's all I want.

822
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:19,998
I can't.

823
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:24,454
It's our last time together.

824
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:26,668
Let's make the most of it.

825
00:44:33,421 --> 00:44:36,766
Real quick, but
then you have to go.

826
00:44:39,594 --> 00:44:42,268
<i>My husband has come undone.</i>

827
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:45,274
<i>We moved to Missouri
to save Maureen...</i>

828
00:44:45,433 --> 00:44:48,152
<i>but as it turns
out, we couldn't.</i>

829
00:44:51,439 --> 00:44:53,191
It means a lot that you came.

830
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:55,610
<i>We took</i> a <i>hit
on the brownstone...</i>

831
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:58,120
<i>and I used the last of my
trust fund to buy him a bar.</i>

832
00:44:58,863 --> 00:45:01,116
<i>So far, it's just costing money.</i>

833
00:45:05,328 --> 00:45:09,128
<i>Nick uses me for sex when he wants.</i>

834
00:45:12,293 --> 00:45:14,796
<i>Otherwise, I don't exist. Whoo!</i>

835
00:45:16,047 --> 00:45:18,015
We should go to Outback tonight.

836
00:45:18,174 --> 00:45:19,300
That would be nice.

837
00:45:19,467 --> 00:45:22,562
<i>Last night, I went
from desperate to pathetic.</i>

838
00:45:23,471 --> 00:45:26,520
<i>I became someone I
don't even like.</i>

839
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:28,480
<i>The kind of woman
I used to mock.</i>

840
00:45:28,893 --> 00:45:30,486
You're out so much.

841
00:45:30,645 --> 00:45:32,864
I know. Stay home.

842
00:45:33,022 --> 00:45:35,241
I can't, I'm already late.
Then, can I come?

843
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:37,072
You would hate it.

844
00:45:37,235 --> 00:45:40,489
It's a bunch of my dorky
high school friends.

845
00:45:41,489 --> 00:45:44,368
Do our code. No bullshit.

846
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:47,203
I thought we weren't
gonna be that couple.

847
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:55,552
Okay, bye.

848
00:45:57,213 --> 00:46:00,057
Hey, I've been thinking. Yeah?

849
00:46:00,216 --> 00:46:01,593
Something positive.

850
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:04,057
Maybe it's time.

851
00:46:05,346 --> 00:46:07,064
Now is literally the worst time.

852
00:46:07,223 --> 00:46:08,463
It would be a new start for us.

853
00:46:08,683 --> 00:46:11,277
And for me, I would have
a real purpose here.

854
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:12,527
A child is not a hobby.

855
00:46:12,687 --> 00:46:13,688
Not a hobby.

856
00:46:14,689 --> 00:46:15,906
An inspiration.

857
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:19,444
We could have had this fight
four hours ago. I'm late.

858
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:20,736
I didn't know it was
gonna be a fight.

859
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:22,621
You really wanna be the
couple that has a baby...

860
00:46:22,697 --> 00:46:24,199
to save their marriage?

861
00:46:24,365 --> 00:46:25,366
"Save"?

862
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:27,914
Reboot, retool,
rekindle, whatever!

863
00:46:28,077 --> 00:46:30,125
And you're gonna walk
out the door now? Yeah!

864
00:46:30,288 --> 00:46:32,711
You're a fucking coward.

865
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:34,625
No, it can't go on like this.

866
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:35,793
Oh, really?

867
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:37,253
I won't. You won't?

868
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:39,639
You won't? Why, it's not
good enough for you?

869
00:46:39,714 --> 00:46:40,714
It's not even close!

870
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:42,884
You stupid bitch!

871
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:46,311
<i>What scared me wasn't
that he'd pushed me.</i>

872
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:50,316
<i>What scared me was how much
he wanted to hurt me more.</i>

873
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:52,735
<i>What scared me was that
I'd finally realized...</i>

874
00:46:53,728 --> 00:46:57,403
<i>I am frightened of
my own husband.</i>

875
00:47:09,285 --> 00:47:10,662
You want me to call for backup?

876
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:12,922
Nah, I'll protect you.

877
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:22,093
Jesus.

878
00:47:27,136 --> 00:47:29,810
They ought to burn
this place down.

879
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:31,937
Seems like
folks are trying.

880
00:47:37,438 --> 00:47:39,611
You really think
this is anything?

881
00:47:39,774 --> 00:47:41,947
Cross it off the list.

882
00:47:53,037 --> 00:47:54,630
Hey, Jason.

883
00:47:54,789 --> 00:47:56,211
What's up, Rhonda?

884
00:47:56,374 --> 00:47:58,627
"...and dedicated to the
proposition that all men..."

885
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:01,132
Have you seen this
girl around here?

886
00:48:01,212 --> 00:48:02,213
Why do you ask?

887
00:48:02,463 --> 00:48:04,306
She was reported missing.

888
00:48:07,468 --> 00:48:09,220
"...and so dedicated,
can long endure."

889
00:48:09,387 --> 00:48:11,185
Yeah. I remember her.

890
00:48:11,347 --> 00:48:13,475
What did she want? Weed, pills?

891
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:16,143
She wanted a gun.

892
00:48:16,394 --> 00:48:18,317
I told her it's not my thing.

893
00:48:18,479 --> 00:48:21,358
I felt bad, though. She
seemed really desperate.

894
00:48:21,524 --> 00:48:22,696
She said it needed
to be small...

895
00:48:22,775 --> 00:48:24,994
so she could keep it close.

896
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:26,870
Are you sure this is her?

897
00:48:27,029 --> 00:48:29,157
You don't forget a girl
like that in here.

898
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:31,534
She was all in pink.

899
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:34,249
It was Valentine's Day.

900
00:48:37,206 --> 00:48:39,834
<i>For Valentine's Day,
I thought I'd buy a gun.</i>

901
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,594
<i>That is how crazy I've become.</i>

902
00:48:43,671 --> 00:48:47,676
<i>Nick wants me gone but he
won't ask for a divorce.</i>

903
00:48:47,842 --> 00:48:51,847
<i>In his mind, I'm the owner of his
bar, his only line of credit.</i>

904
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:53,514
<i>The bitch with the prenup.</i>

905
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:57,568
<i>I could go home to my parents...</i>

906
00:48:57,726 --> 00:49:00,024
<i>but I'd have to tell
them the truth.</i>

907
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:03,908
<i>And I don't even know if I believe
the truth.</i>

908
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:06,865
<i>Can I really think
Nick would hurt me?</i>

909
00:49:07,486 --> 00:49:09,864
<i>I'm being paranoid. Crazy.</i>

910
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:12,495
<i>It's just...</i>

911
00:49:13,159 --> 00:49:15,708
<i>I'd sleep better with a gun.</i>

912
00:49:26,589 --> 00:49:27,886
Oh, shit.

913
00:49:28,048 --> 00:49:31,678
Wake up, baby. My
sister's gonna come out here.

914
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:38,275
Sorry to rush you. It's okay.

915
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:41,570
Here. Let me help you. Okay.

916
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:43,864
Just get that.

917
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:48,027
Be very careful.

918
00:49:48,736 --> 00:49:49,737
I'm all right.

919
00:49:49,904 --> 00:49:52,373
Here you go.

920
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:54,283
Promise me we'll talk every day.

921
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:55,576
Okay, we will.

922
00:49:55,743 --> 00:49:58,462
Every day, Nick,
or I'll go crazy.

923
00:49:59,205 --> 00:50:00,206
Don't go crazy.

924
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:01,624
Okay-

925
00:50:06,045 --> 00:50:09,265
You fucking idiot.

926
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:13,269
You fucking asshole! You fucking
lied to my fucking face!

927
00:50:14,762 --> 00:50:16,890
I'm sorry.

928
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:19,062
How old is she?

929
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:20,650
She's in her early 20s.

930
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:22,394
How long?

931
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:24,104
A year and a half.

932
00:50:24,188 --> 00:50:25,781
You lied to me for over a year?

933
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:27,487
Oh, if I told you, you
would have made me stop.

934
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:29,118
It's so fucking small.

935
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:32,120
You're a liar and a cheat!
You're just like Dad!

936
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:33,451
How did you even meet her?

937
00:50:33,614 --> 00:50:34,831
She's one of my students.

938
00:50:36,075 --> 00:50:38,498
I thought writers hated cliches.
Oh, I'm not a writer.

939
00:50:38,661 --> 00:50:40,789
"Oh, boo-hoo, I got laid off. I
guess I'll fuck a teenager."

940
00:50:40,955 --> 00:50:43,629
It wasn't like that, okay? You have
no idea how shitty it was with Amy...

941
00:50:43,791 --> 00:50:45,589
how fucking terrible
she made me feel.

942
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:48,800
Flyover Boy. I would get
knots in my stomach...

943
00:50:48,963 --> 00:50:50,681
just coming home, knowing she
would be sitting there...

944
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:52,999
dissatisfied, before I even
walked in the fucking door.

945
00:50:53,008 --> 00:50:54,305
This is so bad.

946
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:56,436
If anybody finds out,
you're totally fucked.

947
00:50:56,595 --> 00:50:59,098
Boney found a pair of
panties in my office...

948
00:50:59,265 --> 00:51:00,812
where, occasionally,
Andie and I...

949
00:51:01,267 --> 00:51:02,268
I don't know what
the fuck it means.

950
00:51:02,434 --> 00:51:03,481
<i>Are they Super-Twat's?</i>

951
00:51:03,644 --> 00:51:05,612
Her name is Andie.

952
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:07,148
She's not entirely sure.

953
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:08,861
So we are dealing
with a 20-year-old...

954
00:51:09,024 --> 00:51:10,321
who isn't sure where
she leaves her undies?

955
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:12,684
If they're not Andie's, that
means that they're Amy's...

956
00:51:12,778 --> 00:51:14,371
and she left them
there for me to find.

957
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:16,328
Nick, I was scared
for you before...

958
00:51:16,407 --> 00:51:18,159
and now, I'm fucking petrified.

959
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:20,498
We're having a vigil tonight
for your missing wife...

960
00:51:20,661 --> 00:51:23,665
and this morning, you're kissing
your college girlfriend goodbye!

961
00:51:23,831 --> 00:51:25,003
Can you imagine?

962
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:28,844
Have you watched
television lately?

963
00:51:29,003 --> 00:51:32,007
Cable news is all
over your shit.

964
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:35,180
<i>I mean, what is wrong
with this barkeep?</i>

965
00:51:35,259 --> 00:51:36,761
<i>His wife's nowhere
to be found...</i>

966
00:51:36,844 --> 00:51:39,267
<i>and here's Nick Dunne
for you, flirting.</i>

967
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:40,393
<i>Cute pic, huh?</i>

968
00:51:40,556 --> 00:51:41,603
Who is that?

969
00:51:41,682 --> 00:51:42,899
Some fucking tragedy groupie.

970
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:44,856
Who the fuck is that?
I don't know.

971
00:51:45,019 --> 00:51:46,020
She was trying to
give me a casserole.

972
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:49,190
<i>On the show today we have defense
attorney, Tanner Bolt...</i>

973
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:51,905
<i>patron saint to wife-killers
everywhere-</i>

974
00:51:52,192 --> 00:51:55,571
<i>Tanner Bolt, would you actually
consider defending Nick Dunne?</i>

975
00:51:55,738 --> 00:51:56,739
<i>Well, let me just</i> say...

976
00:51:56,905 --> 00:51:59,533
<i>as always, Ellen, thank you
for such a warm welcome.</i>

977
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:01,247
<i>But of course, I'd
defend Nick Dunne.</i>

978
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:03,975
<i>Listen, just because this guy
isn't walking around weeping...</i>

979
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:05,376
<i>that doesn't mean that
he's not hurting.</i>

980
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:08,759
<i>Tanner, the hallmark of a
sociopath is a lack of empathy.</i>

981
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:11,198
<i>But the truth is, you'd
have to be</i> a <i>sociopath...</i>

982
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:13,051
<i>to behave normally
in this situation...</i>

983
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:15,841
<i>because it's the most abnormal
situation in the world.</i>

984
00:52:16,008 --> 00:52:18,557
<i>Tanner, are you trying to
tell me that this photo...</i>

985
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:20,847
<i>is remotely in the realm
of acceptable behavior?</i>

986
00:52:21,013 --> 00:52:23,687
I'm so sick of being
picked apart by women.

987
00:52:25,059 --> 00:52:26,936
You need to hire Tanner Bolt.

988
00:52:28,687 --> 00:52:29,688
I don't deserve this.

989
00:52:29,855 --> 00:52:31,607
<i>Innocent until proven guilty.</i>

990
00:52:31,774 --> 00:52:34,027
That's exactly what you deserve.

991
00:52:34,193 --> 00:52:35,740
Go home, Nick.

992
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:03,142
Hey, buddy.

993
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:20,702
I can't believe we
haven't arrested this guy.

994
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:22,707
We're not gonna
arrest anybody...

995
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:24,386
just because some
blonde dunce says so.

996
00:53:24,785 --> 00:53:27,288
Why are you going so easy on him?
You got a crush?

997
00:53:27,579 --> 00:53:30,799
One, l am conducting an
investigation, not a witch-hunt.

998
00:53:30,958 --> 00:53:32,756
And, two, don't talk
to me that way, ever.

999
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:34,090
She was trying to buy a gun.

1000
00:53:34,253 --> 00:53:36,301
We don't know who or what
was scaring her, Gil.

1001
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:37,381
Give me the update.

1002
00:53:37,965 --> 00:53:40,468
No drug angles panned out yet,
so cross that off the list.

1003
00:53:40,634 --> 00:53:42,594
I talked to the nurses who
care for Nick's father.

1004
00:53:42,636 --> 00:53:45,230
The guy's a bastard, but he's weak as
a kitten, so cross that off the list.

1005
00:53:45,389 --> 00:53:46,436
Hey.

1006
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:49,898
So, luminol lit up the kitchen
like the 4th of July.

1007
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:51,232
Whoa. Yeah.

1008
00:53:51,395 --> 00:53:52,396
The blood is profuse.

1009
00:53:52,563 --> 00:53:54,657
It is Amy's, type B, and
we should have DNA soon.

1010
00:53:54,732 --> 00:53:55,852
Thoughts on a weapon?

1011
00:53:55,941 --> 00:53:57,739
Trajectory
indicates blunt force.

1012
00:53:57,901 --> 00:54:00,745
Maybe a club or a two-by-four.

1013
00:54:00,821 --> 00:54:03,950
She fell there, but I
doubt she got back up.

1014
00:54:04,116 --> 00:54:05,413
Amy's medical records come in?

1015
00:54:05,576 --> 00:54:07,578
No, we'll have them
later tonight.

1016
00:54:09,163 --> 00:54:10,585
My wife says he's a killer.

1017
00:54:10,831 --> 00:54:13,175
Well, if Tiffany says...

1018
00:54:38,776 --> 00:54:39,777
Hey-

1019
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:41,111
Hey-

1020
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:46,692
Thank you all for coming out.

1021
00:54:48,368 --> 00:54:49,870
Hey Donnie, how are you?

1022
00:54:50,037 --> 00:54:53,382
Rich, thank you so much.

1023
00:55:00,672 --> 00:55:01,673
Hey. Hmm.

1024
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:10,190
<i>Thank you, folks.</i>

1025
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:12,188
<i>Thank you for being
here tonight.</i>

1026
00:55:12,351 --> 00:55:14,149
<i>It just means the
world to our family.</i>

1027
00:55:14,686 --> 00:55:16,154
And to Amy.

1028
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:18,732
As you all know...

1029
00:55:19,566 --> 00:55:22,740
my wife, Amy Elliott Dunne...

1030
00:55:22,903 --> 00:55:24,405
disappeared three days ago.

1031
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:28,413
And I want to implore anyone who
has any information at all...

1032
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:31,374
please come forward. Help us.

1033
00:55:31,537 --> 00:55:33,756
So hot. Ew! He is so creepy.

1034
00:55:33,914 --> 00:55:35,131
I wanna say something...

1035
00:55:35,207 --> 00:55:37,255
because I think some of
you might be wondering...

1036
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:39,340
and are too polite to ask.

1037
00:55:39,837 --> 00:55:42,932
I had nothing to do with the
disappearance of my wife.

1038
00:55:43,507 --> 00:55:45,350
I'm cooperating with the police.

1039
00:55:45,509 --> 00:55:47,432
I haven't hired a lawyer.

1040
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:48,720
I have nothing to hide.

1041
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:52,516
Amy is my soul mate.

1042
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:54,063
She is brilliant...

1043
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:57,696
she's charming, and wise.

1044
00:55:58,021 --> 00:55:59,739
I love you, Amy.

1045
00:56:03,861 --> 00:56:04,953
Asshole.

1046
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:08,203
I love my wife...

1047
00:56:08,574 --> 00:56:09,791
so much.

1048
00:56:12,286 --> 00:56:16,632
And I may not behave for the
cameras the way they want me to...

1049
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:20,135
and if they wanna punish
me for that, that's okay.

1050
00:56:20,294 --> 00:56:23,889
But I just wanna ask you in the
media, please, harass me...

1051
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:26,971
but don't harass the people of this town.

1052
00:56:27,134 --> 00:56:29,057
If you need to mock
somebody, mock me.

1053
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:30,311
Nick!

1054
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:32,630
But please don't turn this
investigation into a circus.

1055
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:34,107
Where's your wife, Nick?

1056
00:56:34,266 --> 00:56:35,768
Let the police do their jobs.

1057
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:37,819
What did you do to
your pregnant wife?

1058
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:40,772
Did you tell
them that, Nick?

1059
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:42,987
Did you tell them Amy
was six weeks pregnant?

1060
00:56:46,737 --> 00:56:48,910
Thank you for your support tonight.
Let's find Amy.

1061
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:52,714
Go ahead, if you guys
wanna say something.

1062
00:56:56,788 --> 00:56:58,165
Gil, go, go.

1063
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:01,501
Nick, where
are you going?

1064
00:57:01,668 --> 00:57:03,136
Stop him!

1065
00:57:03,295 --> 00:57:05,514
No questions right now.
Thank you.

1066
00:57:08,008 --> 00:57:09,555
Why are you running away?

1067
00:57:10,636 --> 00:57:12,058
Don't run.

1068
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:14,139
Everybody, stay back.

1069
00:57:18,936 --> 00:57:20,984
Guys, come on. You know better.

1070
00:57:21,146 --> 00:57:23,490
Get off the grass, get
down to the curb.

1071
00:57:23,649 --> 00:57:24,946
On it.

1072
00:57:25,025 --> 00:57:26,026
All right.

1073
00:57:26,193 --> 00:57:27,945
All right, y'all heard her.
No pictures.

1074
00:57:28,028 --> 00:57:29,325
Hello?

1075
00:57:30,072 --> 00:57:31,415
Hello?

1076
00:57:31,490 --> 00:57:32,490
Fuck.

1077
00:57:32,532 --> 00:57:33,909
You scared me. Want a drink?

1078
00:57:34,076 --> 00:57:35,453
Did you know she was pregnant?

1079
00:57:35,619 --> 00:57:37,621
I told you, Noelle Hawthorne
is fucking crazy.

1080
00:57:37,788 --> 00:57:38,835
She doesn't even know Amy.

1081
00:57:39,498 --> 00:57:41,098
They look like pretty
good friends to me.

1082
00:57:48,674 --> 00:57:50,392
Look, I don't know.

1083
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:51,969
But it certainly doesn't
prove that she's pregnant.

1084
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:53,227
We have her medical
records coming.

1085
00:57:53,387 --> 00:57:55,139
Good. So, let's
talk while we wait.

1086
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:57,399
Let's start over here.
The scene of the crime.

1087
00:57:57,557 --> 00:58:00,310
You see, we've seen
dozens of home invasions.

1088
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:02,320
Dozens and dozens.

1089
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:04,573
This area right here, it looked
wrong from the second we saw it.

1090
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:07,905
The whole thing looked staged.
Watch this.

1091
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:13,245
And yet, they remained upright
throughout this life-and-death struggle?

1092
00:58:13,657 --> 00:58:15,284
I don't know. What do
you want me to say?

1093
00:58:15,367 --> 00:58:17,040
Did you do any housekeeping the
day your wife went missing?

1094
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:20,248
No. Because our guys
did a luminol test.

1095
00:58:20,414 --> 00:58:22,963
And I'm sorry to tell you,
but that kitchen lit up.

1096
00:58:23,125 --> 00:58:25,253
Amy lost a lot of blood
in there, Nick. A lot.

1097
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:26,336
Oh, my God.

1098
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:27,637
Yeah, and then
somebody mopped it up.

1099
00:58:27,796 --> 00:58:30,140
Oh... Wait a second. Why would
they mop up the blood...

1100
00:58:30,298 --> 00:58:31,898
if they're trying to
stage a crime scene?

1101
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:34,553
No blood and no body
suggests kidnapping.

1102
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:37,018
It tells us, look at
people outside the house.

1103
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:38,477
Like these homeless
you keep mentioning.

1104
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:41,610
A pool of blood and no
body suggests homicide.

1105
00:58:41,768 --> 00:58:43,645
It tells us to look at
people inside the house.

1106
00:58:43,812 --> 00:58:45,314
Which is what we're
doing here, Nick.

1107
00:58:45,397 --> 00:58:46,398
I see.

1108
00:58:46,565 --> 00:58:48,192
So, how was
your marriage, Nick?

1109
00:58:48,275 --> 00:58:49,401
Because right now, all
we got is Noelle.

1110
00:58:49,568 --> 00:58:50,990
She says, "Not good."

1111
00:58:51,153 --> 00:58:52,530
Gil, what do you and
your wife argue about?

1112
00:58:52,696 --> 00:58:54,698
What pisses you off? Oh,
money, lack thereof.

1113
00:58:54,865 --> 00:58:56,492
Me and my
ex, it's the same.

1114
00:58:56,658 --> 00:58:59,878
I mention that because we got a
look at your finances, Nick.

1115
00:59:00,037 --> 00:59:02,631
$117,000 in credit card debt.

1116
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:04,632
What? I pulled up some
of the merchandise.

1117
00:59:04,791 --> 00:59:06,668
There are these fun
little splurges.

1118
00:59:06,835 --> 00:59:08,275
I didn't buy
any of this stuff.

1119
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:09,421
I don't even golf!

1120
00:59:09,588 --> 00:59:10,805
I do! You bought great clubs.

1121
00:59:10,964 --> 00:59:12,136
I like the robot dog.

1122
00:59:12,299 --> 00:59:14,142
This is identity theft!
This is a felony!

1123
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:15,218
We need to find
out who did this!

1124
00:59:15,302 --> 00:59:16,982
All right. Let's talk
about life insurance.

1125
00:59:17,095 --> 00:59:19,518
Because in April, you bumped
up Amy's life insurance...

1126
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:20,640
to $1.2 million.

1127
00:59:20,724 --> 00:59:22,977
Yes, I did. That was her idea.
She wanted me to.

1128
00:59:23,143 --> 00:59:24,190
You filed the paperwork.

1129
00:59:24,352 --> 00:59:25,729
Because she told me to! Whoa!

1130
00:59:25,812 --> 00:59:27,189
Hold on a sec.

1131
00:59:27,355 --> 00:59:29,153
Yeah? Okay.

1132
00:59:31,068 --> 00:59:32,240
For sure?

1133
00:59:32,652 --> 00:59:33,824
All right.

1134
00:59:37,824 --> 00:59:38,871
She was pregnant.

1135
00:59:42,996 --> 00:59:44,498
This is insane.

1136
00:59:44,664 --> 00:59:47,042
So, my question becomes...

1137
00:59:47,209 --> 00:59:50,008
I don't want to talk
to you again, ever...

1138
00:59:50,170 --> 00:59:51,342
without a lawyer.

1139
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:00,680
Margo!

1140
01:00:11,566 --> 01:00:12,567
Hey-

1141
01:00:14,945 --> 01:00:17,198
Just hold on a second.
Let me finish.

1142
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:18,281
Nick?

1143
01:00:18,365 --> 01:00:21,039
I hear you, I hear you.
I was as surprised as...

1144
01:00:21,201 --> 01:00:25,047
I know you're upset. I had
no idea she was pregnant.

1145
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:28,584
Listen, I thought so, too,
but evidently that wasn't...

1146
01:00:31,086 --> 01:00:33,088
You want to know the truth?

1147
01:00:33,255 --> 01:00:35,633
The truth is, Amy
didn't want kids.

1148
01:00:38,051 --> 01:00:40,099
Well, I'm as surprised as...

1149
01:00:41,429 --> 01:00:43,227
You told me you
didn't want kids.

1150
01:00:43,598 --> 01:00:45,475
I was trying
to put a good face on.

1151
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:47,394
Then, suddenly, you've
got a pregnant wife.

1152
01:00:47,561 --> 01:00:48,778
That's a problem for you.

1153
01:00:48,937 --> 01:00:51,907
Especially when you factor in
the secret teenage girlfriend.

1154
01:00:52,065 --> 01:00:53,408
Oh, stop watching Ellen Abbott!

1155
01:00:53,567 --> 01:00:54,910
You have to fucking talk to me!

1156
01:00:57,571 --> 01:00:59,915
I didn't tell you that
she didn't want kids...

1157
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:01,492
because she didn't want me to.

1158
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:02,659
Because it would
have just been...

1159
01:01:02,742 --> 01:01:03,743
another reason for
you to hate her.

1160
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:05,662
And we had enough of those already!
It was easier to just...

1161
01:01:05,829 --> 01:01:07,923
Lie to me? I wanted kids!

1162
01:01:08,081 --> 01:01:10,241
When we first moved here, I
went to a fertility clinic!

1163
01:01:10,292 --> 01:01:11,839
It didn't work? I did my part!

1164
01:01:11,918 --> 01:01:12,919
Masturbate. When it came time...

1165
01:01:13,003 --> 01:01:14,755
for Amy to do her thing, all
of a sudden it was like...

1166
01:01:14,838 --> 01:01:16,398
"Well, I don't know. Maybe.
No, thanks."

1167
01:01:16,423 --> 01:01:18,425
Now, who would believe you?

1168
01:01:19,593 --> 01:01:20,810
All right.

1169
01:01:30,437 --> 01:01:32,110
This is a letter
from the clinic...

1170
01:01:32,272 --> 01:01:34,616
notifying me that they're
gonna destroy my sample...

1171
01:01:34,774 --> 01:01:36,776
unless I contact them.

1172
01:01:38,028 --> 01:01:39,450
So, I gave it to Amy.

1173
01:01:39,613 --> 01:01:42,492
The next day, I saw
it in the trash.

1174
01:01:42,657 --> 01:01:44,125
But you were already with
Andie by then, right?

1175
01:01:44,284 --> 01:01:47,003
I wanted a baby with Amy.

1176
01:01:47,162 --> 01:01:48,880
A year ago, Amy
being pregnant...

1177
01:01:48,955 --> 01:01:51,333
would have been the
best thing ever!

1178
01:01:57,881 --> 01:01:59,633
"When your poor Amy has a
cold, this dessert just..."

1179
01:01:59,799 --> 01:02:01,199
This is the clue you
couldn't solve.

1180
01:02:01,218 --> 01:02:02,344
Yeah.

1181
01:02:04,054 --> 01:02:05,601
A letter from Desi.

1182
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:07,307
That creepy boyfriend of Amy's?

1183
01:02:07,474 --> 01:02:09,755
It was the fucking rich guy who
would do anything for her.

1184
01:02:09,893 --> 01:02:11,736
It just kept hanging over my head.
It was disgusting.

1185
01:02:11,853 --> 01:02:12,854
Your prenup?

1186
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:14,777
Nick, why have you
kept this stuff?

1187
01:02:14,856 --> 01:02:16,096
It's like a little box of hate.

1188
01:02:16,233 --> 01:02:18,031
I don't know, Go!
Maybe I hate her!

1189
01:02:20,904 --> 01:02:23,908
I love you no matter what.

1190
01:02:24,074 --> 01:02:25,326
But you need to tell me.

1191
01:02:25,492 --> 01:02:26,914
Tell you what?

1192
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:29,371
What are you asking me?

1193
01:02:30,956 --> 01:02:34,130
Are you asking me if I
killed my wife, Go?

1194
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:36,664
Is that what you're asking me?
If I murdered my wife?

1195
01:02:36,711 --> 01:02:39,134
I would never ask you that!

1196
01:02:43,093 --> 01:02:44,094
Margo!

1197
01:02:56,898 --> 01:02:59,117
Don't walk on the glass.

1198
01:02:59,484 --> 01:03:00,736
Oh.

1199
01:03:00,819 --> 01:03:03,447
You have no clue, do you?

1200
01:03:21,256 --> 01:03:22,849
Why was he
here that night?

1201
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:27,141
His wife is missing.
Why come here?

1202
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:28,267
Who cares?

1203
01:03:28,555 --> 01:03:29,681
Rhonda, we got this.

1204
01:03:29,848 --> 01:03:31,225
Let's make the arrest.

1205
01:03:31,391 --> 01:03:33,314
Do you know how hard it is to make
a murder case without a body?

1206
01:03:33,393 --> 01:03:34,394
No.

1207
01:03:34,477 --> 01:03:36,525
Well, it's incredibly hard.

1208
01:03:36,688 --> 01:03:39,441
So, I want one last thing.

1209
01:03:39,524 --> 01:03:40,525
What's that?

1210
01:03:42,235 --> 01:03:44,533
I want a body.

1211
01:03:45,697 --> 01:03:49,998
<i>Picture me, I'm a
girl who's very, very bad.</i>

1212
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:51,787
Be careful.

1213
01:03:56,333 --> 01:04:00,759
<i>I need to be punished, and
by "punished," I mean "had."</i>

1214
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:06,301
Fuck.

1215
01:04:08,261 --> 01:04:11,105
<i>It's where you keep
goodies for anniversary five.</i>

1216
01:04:12,349 --> 01:04:14,397
<i>So, open the door...</i>

1217
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:15,811
Punish. Wood. Beach.

1218
01:04:15,977 --> 01:04:18,480
<i>and look alive.</i>

1219
01:04:21,608 --> 01:04:24,202
Punish. Wood.

1220
01:04:25,362 --> 01:04:26,955
Wood.

1221
01:04:59,062 --> 01:05:01,656
<i>I will practice believing
my husband loves me...</i>

1222
01:05:01,815 --> 01:05:04,238
<i>and will love this baby.</i>

1223
01:05:04,901 --> 01:05:08,531
<i>That this child might
really save our marriage.</i>

1224
01:05:09,406 --> 01:05:10,874
<i>But I could be wrong.</i>

1225
01:05:17,038 --> 01:05:18,961
<i>Because sometimes...</i>

1226
01:05:19,958 --> 01:05:22,177
<i>the way he looks at</i> me...

1227
01:05:23,253 --> 01:05:24,880
<i>I think...</i>

1228
01:05:25,046 --> 01:05:26,138
<i>man of my dreams...</i>

1229
01:05:28,049 --> 01:05:30,143
<i>father of my child...</i>

1230
01:05:30,927 --> 01:05:34,932
<i>this man of mine may kill me.</i>

1231
01:05:36,307 --> 01:05:38,309
<i>He may truly...</i>

1232
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:39,982
<i>kill me.</i>

1233
01:05:42,814 --> 01:05:43,815
WTF?

1234
01:06:08,882 --> 01:06:11,476
<i>I am so much happier
now that I'm dead.</i>

1235
01:06:16,514 --> 01:06:18,107
<i>Technically, "missing."</i>

1236
01:06:18,933 --> 01:06:21,106
<i>Soon to be presumed dead.</i>

1237
01:06:22,312 --> 01:06:23,438
<i>Gone.</i>

1238
01:06:24,397 --> 01:06:27,526
<i>And my lazy, lying, cheating,
oblivious husband...</i>

1239
01:06:27,692 --> 01:06:30,992
<i>will go to prison for my murder.</i>

1240
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:34,703
<i>Nick Dunne took my pride
and my dignity...</i>

1241
01:06:34,866 --> 01:06:37,244
<i>and my hope and my money.</i>

1242
01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:40,880
<i>He took and took from me
until I no longer existed.</i>

1243
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:42,336
<i>That's murder.</i>

1244
01:06:42,499 --> 01:06:45,298
<i>Let the punishment
fit the crime.</i>

1245
01:06:45,877 --> 01:06:48,881
<i>To fake a convincing murder,
you have to have discipline.</i>

1246
01:06:53,092 --> 01:06:56,096
<i>You befriend a local idiot.</i>

1247
01:06:59,641 --> 01:07:02,815
<i>Harvest the details
of her humdrum life.</i>

1248
01:07:03,186 --> 01:07:06,781
<i>And cram her with stories about
your husband's violent temper.</i>

1249
01:07:07,899 --> 01:07:10,197
<i>Secretly create some
money troubles.</i>

1250
01:07:10,443 --> 01:07:13,617
<i>Credit cards, perhaps
online gambling.</i>

1251
01:07:16,241 --> 01:07:18,335
<i>With the help of
the unwitting...</i>

1252
01:07:18,493 --> 01:07:20,495
<i>bump up your life insurance.</i>

1253
01:07:22,205 --> 01:07:25,254
<i>Purchase getaway car.
Craigslist.</i>

1254
01:07:25,416 --> 01:07:28,716
<i>Generic. Cheap. Pay cash.</i>

1255
01:07:29,170 --> 01:07:33,676
<i>You need to package yourself so that
people will truly mourn your loss.</i>

1256
01:07:33,841 --> 01:07:36,811
<i>And America loves
pregnant women.</i>

1257
01:07:37,136 --> 01:07:40,015
<i>As if it's so hard
to spread your legs.</i>

1258
01:07:40,181 --> 01:07:41,478
<i>You know what's hard?</i>

1259
01:07:41,975 --> 01:07:43,818
<i>Faking a pregnancy.</i>

1260
01:07:43,977 --> 01:07:46,150
<i>First, drain your toilet.</i>

1261
01:07:47,855 --> 01:07:50,483
<i>Invite pregnant idiot
into your home...</i>

1262
01:07:50,650 --> 01:07:53,153
<i>and ply her with lemonade.</i>

1263
01:07:58,324 --> 01:08:00,497
<i>Steal pregnant idiot's urine.</i>

1264
01:08:02,704 --> 01:08:04,081
<i>Voilà.</i>

1265
01:08:04,247 --> 01:08:08,218
<i>A pregnancy is now part of
your legal medical record.</i>

1266
01:08:14,716 --> 01:08:16,059
<i>Happy anniversary.</i>

1267
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:21,348
<i>Wait for your
clueless husband...</i>

1268
01:08:21,514 --> 01:08:23,391
<i>to start his day.</i>

1269
01:08:24,851 --> 01:08:26,194
<i>Off he goes.</i>

1270
01:08:26,352 --> 01:08:28,525
<i>And the clock is ticking.</i>

1271
01:08:29,689 --> 01:08:32,192
<i>Meticulously stage
your crime scene...</i>

1272
01:08:32,859 --> 01:08:36,864
<i>with just enough mistakes to
raise the specter of doubt.</i>

1273
01:08:38,281 --> 01:08:40,249
<i>You need to bleed.</i>

1274
01:08:40,366 --> 01:08:41,367
<i>A lot.</i>

1275
01:08:42,201 --> 01:08:43,874
<i>A lot, a lot.</i>

1276
01:08:47,206 --> 01:08:49,049
<i>A head wound kind of bleed.</i>

1277
01:08:49,709 --> 01:08:52,212
<i>A crime scene kind of bleed.</i>

1278
01:08:55,214 --> 01:08:58,218
<i>You need to clean poorly...
like he would.</i>

1279
01:08:59,093 --> 01:09:01,596
<i>Clean and bleed.
Bleed and clean.</i>

1280
01:09:02,221 --> 01:09:04,815
<i>And leave a little
something behind.</i>

1281
01:09:05,475 --> 01:09:07,227
<i>A fire in July?</i>

1282
01:09:08,770 --> 01:09:11,148
<i>And because you're you...
you don't stop there.</i>

1283
01:09:11,564 --> 01:09:13,658
<i>You need a diary.</i>

1284
01:09:13,816 --> 01:09:16,740
<i>Minimum, 300 entries on
the Nick and Amy story.</i>

1285
01:09:17,403 --> 01:09:19,576
<i>Start with the fairy
tale early days.</i>

1286
01:09:19,739 --> 01:09:21,912
<i>Those are true. And
they're crucial.</i>

1287
01:09:22,075 --> 01:09:24,077
<i>You want Nick and
Amy to be likeable.</i>

1288
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:27,914
<i>After that, you in vent.
The spending.</i>

1289
01:09:28,081 --> 01:09:29,754
<i>The abuse. The fear.</i>

1290
01:09:29,916 --> 01:09:32,760
<i>The threat of violence.</i>

1291
01:09:32,919 --> 01:09:34,887
<i>And Nick thought
he was the writer.</i>

1292
01:09:35,588 --> 01:09:36,885
<i>Burn it just the right amount.</i>

1293
01:09:38,716 --> 01:09:40,593
<i>Make sure the cops will find it.</i>

1294
01:09:45,598 --> 01:09:48,647
<i>Finally, honor tradition with
a very special treasure hunt.</i>

1295
01:09:51,229 --> 01:09:53,903
<i>And if I get everything right,
the world will hate Nick...</i>

1296
01:09:54,065 --> 01:09:56,659
<i>for killing his
beautiful, pregnant wife.</i>

1297
01:09:56,818 --> 01:09:59,321
<i>And after all the outrage,
when I'm ready...</i>

1298
01:09:59,487 --> 01:10:01,487
<i>I'll go out on the water
with a handful of pills...</i>

1299
01:10:01,489 --> 01:10:03,912
<i>and a pocket full of stones.</i>

1300
01:10:04,075 --> 01:10:06,749
<i>And when they find my
body, they'll know...</i>

1301
01:10:06,911 --> 01:10:10,085
<i>Nick Dunne dumped his
beloved like garbage.</i>

1302
01:10:10,248 --> 01:10:12,467
<i>And she floated down
past all the other...</i>

1303
01:10:12,625 --> 01:10:15,970
<i>abused, unwanted,
inconvenient women.</i>

1304
01:10:17,338 --> 01:10:19,306
<i>Then, Nick will die, too.</i>

1305
01:10:20,174 --> 01:10:21,926
<i>Nick and Amy will be gone.</i>

1306
01:10:22,093 --> 01:10:24,095
<i>But, then, we never
really existed.</i>

1307
01:10:24,262 --> 01:10:27,357
<i>Nick loved a girl I
was pretending to be.</i>

1308
01:10:27,515 --> 01:10:28,641
<i>"Cool Girl."</i>

1309
01:10:28,975 --> 01:10:32,696
<i>Men always use that as
their defining compliment.</i>

1310
01:10:32,770 --> 01:10:33,771
<i>"She's a cool girl."</i>

1311
01:10:34,981 --> 01:10:35,982
<i>Cool Girl is hot.</i>

1312
01:10:36,149 --> 01:10:37,401
<i>Cool Girl is game.</i>

1313
01:10:37,483 --> 01:10:38,530
<i>Cool Girl is fun.</i>

1314
01:10:38,943 --> 01:10:41,321
<i>Cool Girl never gets
angry at her man.</i>

1315
01:10:41,487 --> 01:10:44,115
<i>She only smiles in a
chagrined, loving manner...</i>

1316
01:10:44,782 --> 01:10:47,626
<i>and then presents her
mouth for fucking.</i>

1317
01:10:47,785 --> 01:10:49,662
<i>She likes what he likes.</i>

1318
01:10:49,829 --> 01:10:53,299
<i>So evidently, he's a vinyl
hipster who loves fetish manga.</i>

1319
01:10:54,333 --> 01:10:57,507
<i>If he likes Girls Gone
Wild, she's a mall babe...</i>

1320
01:10:57,670 --> 01:11:01,345
<i>who talks football and endures
buffalo wings at Hooters.</i>

1321
01:11:01,507 --> 01:11:04,977
<i>When I met Nick Dunne, I
knew he wanted Cool Girl.</i>

1322
01:11:05,136 --> 01:11:07,685
<i>And for him, I'll admit,
I was willing to try.</i>

1323
01:11:07,847 --> 01:11:09,849
<i>I wax-stripped my pussy raw.</i>

1324
01:11:10,516 --> 01:11:13,645
<i>I drank canned beer watching
Adam Sandier movies.</i>

1325
01:11:13,895 --> 01:11:16,523
<i>I ate cold pizza and
remained a size two.</i>

1326
01:11:16,731 --> 01:11:18,699
<i>I blew him semi-regularly.</i>

1327
01:11:20,026 --> 01:11:21,369
<i>I lived in the moment.</i>

1328
01:11:21,652 --> 01:11:24,201
<i>I was fucking game.</i>

1329
01:11:24,822 --> 01:11:26,870
<i>I can't say I didn't
enjoy some of it.</i>

1330
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:30,874
<i>Nick teased out of me things
I didn't know existed.</i>

1331
01:11:31,037 --> 01:11:34,211
<i>A lightness, a humor, an ease.</i>

1332
01:11:34,373 --> 01:11:37,172
<i>But I made him smarter. Sharper.</i>

1333
01:11:37,335 --> 01:11:40,839
<i>I inspired him to
rise to my level.</i>

1334
01:11:41,005 --> 01:11:44,760
<i>I forged the man of my dreams.</i>

1335
01:11:47,094 --> 01:11:49,893
<i>We were happy pretending
to be other people.</i>

1336
01:11:50,056 --> 01:11:51,899
<i>We were the happiest
couple we knew.</i>

1337
01:11:53,518 --> 01:11:56,522
<i>And what's the point of being
together if you're not the happiest?</i>

1338
01:11:57,188 --> 01:11:59,282
<i>But Nick got</i> lazy.

1339
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:01,534
<i>He became someone I did
not agree to marry.</i>

1340
01:12:01,692 --> 01:12:04,866
<i>He actually expected me to
love him unconditionally.</i>

1341
01:12:05,530 --> 01:12:09,910
<i>Then he dragged me, penniless, to
the navel of this great country...</i>

1342
01:12:10,076 --> 01:12:13,922
<i>and found himself a newer,
younger, bouncier...</i>

1343
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:15,081
<i>Cool Girl.</i>

1344
01:12:17,416 --> 01:12:21,592
<i>You think I'd let him destroy me
and end up happier than ever?</i>

1345
01:12:22,088 --> 01:12:23,761
<i>No fucking way.</i>

1346
01:12:24,131 --> 01:12:25,929
<i>He doesn't get to win.</i>

1347
01:12:36,269 --> 01:12:40,240
<i>My cute, charming,
salt-of-the-earth, Missouri guy.</i>

1348
01:12:42,650 --> 01:12:45,119
He needed to learn.

1349
01:12:45,820 --> 01:12:48,448
<i>Grown-ups work for things.</i>

1350
01:12:48,990 --> 01:12:50,958
<i>Grown-ups pay-</i>

1351
01:12:52,326 --> 01:12:54,920
<i>Grown-ups suffer consequences.</i>

1352
01:12:58,416 --> 01:12:59,633
Wait.

1353
01:13:00,001 --> 01:13:02,675
I need 20 seconds where you
don't judge me, interrupt me...

1354
01:13:02,837 --> 01:13:04,464
or get angry.

1355
01:13:05,923 --> 01:13:07,470
Okay-

1356
01:13:11,429 --> 01:13:13,272
Is that all the stuff
from the credit cards?

1357
01:13:13,431 --> 01:13:16,230
Where do you store goodies
for anniversary five?

1358
01:13:16,309 --> 01:13:17,310
Wood.

1359
01:13:17,476 --> 01:13:18,477
<i>Woodshed.</i>

1360
01:13:18,561 --> 01:13:20,484
Yeah, my woodshed.

1361
01:13:20,646 --> 01:13:23,149
That fucking bitch.

1362
01:13:24,984 --> 01:13:26,201
I thought... It's all right.

1363
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:27,828
I would have, too.

1364
01:13:31,282 --> 01:13:32,374
What's that present?

1365
01:13:32,533 --> 01:13:34,160
I don't know.

1366
01:13:34,327 --> 01:13:36,295
Let's find out.

1367
01:13:42,877 --> 01:13:44,254
"Dear Husband...

1368
01:13:44,337 --> 01:13:46,760
"I know you think you're moving
through this world unseen.

1369
01:13:46,839 --> 01:13:48,136
"Don't believe
that for a second.

1370
01:13:48,299 --> 01:13:50,580
"I know where you've been, and
I know where you're going."

1371
01:13:53,804 --> 01:13:55,727
"For this anniversary,
I've arranged a trip.

1372
01:13:55,890 --> 01:13:57,642
"Follow the river, up, up, up.

1373
01:13:57,808 --> 01:14:00,402
"Sit back and relax,
because you are done."

1374
01:14:00,561 --> 01:14:01,858
What's "up, up river"?

1375
01:14:02,021 --> 01:14:04,023
"Up the river." Prison.

1376
01:14:04,231 --> 01:14:06,029
Fucking crazy bitch.

1377
01:14:06,192 --> 01:14:07,694
That's what this is.

1378
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:10,033
She's framing me for her murder.

1379
01:14:10,196 --> 01:14:11,516
You married a
complete psychopath.

1380
01:14:11,530 --> 01:14:13,498
The morning of our
anniversary...

1381
01:14:13,699 --> 01:14:17,875
I was gonna ask her for a divorce.
I just couldn't do it.

1382
01:14:18,037 --> 01:14:20,381
I couldn't fake it for
another year, another day.

1383
01:14:20,539 --> 01:14:21,586
Then what happened?

1384
01:14:21,666 --> 01:14:22,758
Before I could say
anything, she said...

1385
01:14:22,833 --> 01:14:26,087
"I need you to go somewhere and
really think about our marriage."

1386
01:14:26,253 --> 01:14:27,379
She knew I would go
to Sawyer Beach.

1387
01:14:27,546 --> 01:14:28,718
So you'd have no alibi.

1388
01:14:28,881 --> 01:14:31,100
She stage-managed me.

1389
01:14:31,384 --> 01:14:34,934
She knew exactly what I would do.
And I fucking did it.

1390
01:14:35,096 --> 01:14:36,518
I went to the beach, I
thought about our marriage.

1391
01:14:36,681 --> 01:14:38,361
I came back and decided
I wanted a divorce.

1392
01:14:38,432 --> 01:14:39,672
And by the time you got home...

1393
01:14:39,684 --> 01:14:41,231
She was gone.

1394
01:14:41,602 --> 01:14:42,603
Oh, you fuck!

1395
01:14:42,770 --> 01:14:44,363
She's good.

1396
01:14:45,356 --> 01:14:47,233
Part of me was relieved...

1397
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:49,698
when I thought she was gone.

1398
01:14:54,073 --> 01:14:55,791
Punch and Judy puppets.

1399
01:14:58,786 --> 01:15:01,756
Remember, he beats Judy to
death and kills that baby.

1400
01:15:01,914 --> 01:15:03,040
So I'm Punch.

1401
01:15:04,041 --> 01:15:06,043
We already knew that,
Amy, what's your point?

1402
01:15:07,211 --> 01:15:10,055
Does Missouri have
the death penalty?

1403
01:15:36,949 --> 01:15:38,371
Hey, neighbor.

1404
01:15:39,285 --> 01:15:41,663
It's been weeks since I had
anyone decent next door.

1405
01:15:42,288 --> 01:15:44,791
Well, I don't know
how decent I feel.

1406
01:15:44,957 --> 01:15:46,425
Well, as long as you
don't own a python...

1407
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:47,968
and blast death metal at 4 AM...

1408
01:15:48,127 --> 01:15:50,004
we're gonna be best friends.

1409
01:15:50,171 --> 01:15:52,139
All right. Nice meeting you.

1410
01:15:52,298 --> 01:15:53,891
I'm Greta.

1411
01:15:54,508 --> 01:15:55,680
I'm Nancy.

1412
01:15:55,843 --> 01:15:57,686
Are you going to the marina?
I could use some creamer.

1413
01:15:57,845 --> 01:15:59,142
Oh, I'm sorry. I can't.

1414
01:15:59,305 --> 01:16:00,522
I've got work to do.

1415
01:16:00,806 --> 01:16:02,854
All right. See you around!

1416
01:16:03,142 --> 01:16:05,065
You Will.

1417
01:16:51,023 --> 01:16:56,245
Come on. Show me that
darling Nicky smile.

1418
01:16:58,030 --> 01:16:59,907
You asshole.

1419
01:17:15,381 --> 01:17:16,883
Hey-

1420
01:17:19,677 --> 01:17:21,429
Nancy.

1421
01:17:23,722 --> 01:17:25,565
Nancy.

1422
01:17:26,559 --> 01:17:28,778
It's hot again today.

1423
01:17:31,063 --> 01:17:32,906
So, uh, where are you from?

1424
01:17:33,399 --> 01:17:34,571
Let me guess.

1425
01:17:37,486 --> 01:17:38,533
Nebraska.

1426
01:17:40,906 --> 01:17:42,123
New Orleans.

1427
01:17:45,578 --> 01:17:47,956
You know, l am an expert oiler.

1428
01:17:48,122 --> 01:17:49,795
Oh, I just bet you are.

1429
01:17:49,957 --> 01:17:52,585
Lotions and balms. Ointment.

1430
01:17:53,294 --> 01:17:55,092
I would hate for y'all
to get tan lines.

1431
01:17:55,254 --> 01:17:57,256
So sweet.

1432
01:17:58,090 --> 01:18:00,764
Okay. You know where I'll be.

1433
01:18:03,637 --> 01:18:06,060
I see we have the
same taste in men.

1434
01:18:07,766 --> 01:18:09,894
I clipped it on a
bathroom cabinet.

1435
01:18:10,060 --> 01:18:13,109
Least you could do is not
keep his secrets for him.

1436
01:18:14,148 --> 01:18:15,400
Let me guess.

1437
01:18:15,566 --> 01:18:19,446
He's trying to watch the big
game and you just won't shut up.

1438
01:18:19,737 --> 01:18:22,456
No, you don't seem
like much of a talker.

1439
01:18:22,531 --> 01:18:23,532
Oh, I got it.

1440
01:18:23,616 --> 01:18:25,960
You caught your boy rubbing up
on some hot little skank...

1441
01:18:26,118 --> 01:18:28,118
and he apologized to you
by busting you a good one.

1442
01:18:30,289 --> 01:18:31,290
Worse.

1443
01:18:31,624 --> 01:18:32,625
Worse?

1444
01:18:33,459 --> 01:18:37,054
I went to the bar where
he works to surprise him.

1445
01:18:37,213 --> 01:18:39,432
<i>And out he comes with this girl</i>

1446
01:18:39,506 --> 01:18:41,929
<i>who had no business
being in a bar.</i>

1447
01:18:44,887 --> 01:18:46,889
<i>On the very first
night that we met...</i>

1448
01:18:47,139 --> 01:18:51,315
<i>we walked by a bakery that was
having their sugar delivered.</i>

1449
01:18:52,144 --> 01:18:54,397
<i>And it was in the
air, everywhere.</i>

1450
01:18:54,563 --> 01:18:56,736
<i>A sugar storm.</i>

1451
01:18:56,899 --> 01:18:58,901
<i>And before he kissed me...</i>

1452
01:18:59,068 --> 01:19:01,162
he leaned in...

1453
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:04,953
<i>and did this.</i>

1454
01:19:15,626 --> 01:19:16,626
<i>And guess what.</i>

1455
01:19:16,669 --> 01:19:17,795
<i>What?</i>

1456
01:19:18,128 --> 01:19:19,846
He did the exact
same thing with her.

1457
01:19:24,093 --> 01:19:26,972
That is the most disgusting
thing I ever heard.

1458
01:19:27,137 --> 01:19:28,855
Thank you.

1459
01:19:29,765 --> 01:19:30,766
Wow.

1460
01:19:44,154 --> 01:19:45,201
Thanks very much.

1461
01:19:51,996 --> 01:19:54,294
Well, we've gone mainstream.

1462
01:20:09,888 --> 01:20:12,892
It's an appeals process, so we
will attempt to appeal to them.

1463
01:20:13,058 --> 01:20:15,186
Mr. Bolt. Tanner Bolt?

1464
01:20:17,062 --> 01:20:18,359
Nick Dunne.

1465
01:20:18,522 --> 01:20:20,820
I have been sitting by
the phone, my friend.

1466
01:20:24,278 --> 01:20:25,404
I'm sorry.

1467
01:20:25,571 --> 01:20:27,289
Do you not believe me?

1468
01:20:27,448 --> 01:20:30,577
No, I believe you. It's just the
craziest thing I've ever heard.

1469
01:20:30,743 --> 01:20:34,088
I love it. But, for
you, it sucks.

1470
01:20:34,788 --> 01:20:36,348
But you gotta have a
grudging respect...

1471
01:20:36,415 --> 01:20:37,962
for your wife at
this point, right?

1472
01:20:38,125 --> 01:20:39,593
Are you laughing me out
of the building? No!

1473
01:20:39,752 --> 01:20:41,379
Are you kidding me? I'm in.

1474
01:20:41,545 --> 01:20:42,888
I'm way in.

1475
01:20:43,047 --> 01:20:45,550
You came to the right guy.
This is what I do, Nick.

1476
01:20:45,716 --> 01:20:49,016
This is why I have a $100,000 retainer.
I win the unwinnable cases.

1477
01:20:49,178 --> 01:20:50,725
$100,000?

1478
01:20:50,888 --> 01:20:52,310
We'll figure something out.

1479
01:20:52,431 --> 01:20:53,471
I'll give you a special...

1480
01:20:53,515 --> 01:20:56,314
"my wife is skilled in the
art of vengeance" rate.

1481
01:20:56,477 --> 01:20:57,478
Okay-

1482
01:20:57,561 --> 01:20:59,063
So, what's the plan?

1483
01:20:59,229 --> 01:21:00,981
Well, right now, it's a
"he said, she said."

1484
01:21:01,148 --> 01:21:02,149
She's telling a better story.

1485
01:21:02,232 --> 01:21:03,484
No, Nick.

1486
01:21:03,650 --> 01:21:05,493
She is telling the
perfect story.

1487
01:21:05,778 --> 01:21:08,952
So, we need to start today to prepare
your defense, should we need it.

1488
01:21:09,114 --> 01:21:10,366
And if we decide to go
with your version of...

1489
01:21:10,449 --> 01:21:11,496
The truth.

1490
01:21:12,409 --> 01:21:15,583
Then we'll need to realign the
public's perception of Amy.

1491
01:21:15,788 --> 01:21:17,916
Make them stop seeing her
as America's sweetheart...

1492
01:21:18,082 --> 01:21:19,299
and see her for what she is...

1493
01:21:19,375 --> 01:21:21,423
which a mind-fucker
of the first degree.

1494
01:21:21,835 --> 01:21:23,712
Now, that is a huge realignment.

1495
01:21:23,796 --> 01:21:25,673
We'll need other
voices besides yours.

1496
01:21:25,839 --> 01:21:26,886
There has to be
someone out there...

1497
01:21:26,965 --> 01:21:27,966
that she's screwed
with in the past.

1498
01:21:28,133 --> 01:21:29,555
There's a New York guy.

1499
01:21:29,635 --> 01:21:31,103
O'Hara, Tommy O'Hara.

1500
01:21:31,261 --> 01:21:32,261
Eight years ago...

1501
01:21:32,304 --> 01:21:33,584
she pressed charges against him.

1502
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:35,853
That should be easy to find.

1503
01:21:36,392 --> 01:21:39,646
Um, ex-classmate, Desi Collings.

1504
01:21:39,812 --> 01:21:41,692
She said that he stalked her.
He's in St. Louis.

1505
01:21:42,981 --> 01:21:45,234
You go talk to Tommy, and
I'll draw up the contract.

1506
01:21:49,530 --> 01:21:52,534
I told you, you came
to the right guy.

1507
01:21:54,743 --> 01:21:55,960
Apparently.

1508
01:22:05,003 --> 01:22:06,676
Tommy?

1509
01:22:06,839 --> 01:22:08,386
Yeah.

1510
01:22:08,799 --> 01:22:10,767
Thanks for seeing me.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1511
01:22:13,011 --> 01:22:15,560
Urn, you're gonna want a drink.

1512
01:22:16,098 --> 01:22:17,315
Yeah.

1513
01:22:17,474 --> 01:22:20,148
<i>So, she said you
got physical with her.</i>

1514
01:22:20,310 --> 01:22:23,154
No, dude, she said I raped her.

1515
01:22:23,313 --> 01:22:25,691
First degree, felony rape.

1516
01:22:26,442 --> 01:22:28,115
Did you do it? Did you do it?

1517
01:22:28,193 --> 01:22:29,240
Yeah.

1518
01:22:29,319 --> 01:22:31,413
I was looking at
30 years to life.

1519
01:22:31,947 --> 01:22:33,369
Did you get a trial? Fuck, no.

1520
01:22:33,532 --> 01:22:35,626
Do I look like I would
do well in the yard?

1521
01:22:35,784 --> 01:22:38,708
I pled down, man. Sexual
assault one, no jail time.

1522
01:22:39,121 --> 01:22:40,668
That's something. Oh, yeah.

1523
01:22:40,831 --> 01:22:42,128
I've been unemployed for
the last eight years...

1524
01:22:42,291 --> 01:22:44,669
because I have to write "sexual
offender" on every job application.

1525
01:22:44,835 --> 01:22:46,195
I'm on a neighborhood
watch list...

1526
01:22:46,295 --> 01:22:47,672
because I have to
register as a predator.

1527
01:22:47,838 --> 01:22:49,478
I haven't had a date
in almost a decade...

1528
01:22:49,506 --> 01:22:51,179
because if a girl googles me...

1529
01:22:53,135 --> 01:22:55,058
Could you walk me
through what happened?

1530
01:22:55,345 --> 01:22:58,349
I meet Amy at this
party, you know?

1531
01:22:58,515 --> 01:23:00,017
We click. She's perfect.

1532
01:23:00,184 --> 01:23:02,403
She's beautiful, she's
smart, she's well-read...

1533
01:23:02,561 --> 01:23:04,734
she's got an ass like a
20-year-old stripper.

1534
01:23:04,897 --> 01:23:06,570
I think, "What's the catch?"

1535
01:23:06,732 --> 01:23:09,906
A few months, it hits me.
This is not going to be easy.

1536
01:23:10,569 --> 01:23:13,493
Girls like a
fixer-upper, but Amy?

1537
01:23:13,655 --> 01:23:17,000
She annexed me. She
made me her business.

1538
01:23:17,159 --> 01:23:20,834
It was just too much. She
went out and bought me ties.

1539
01:23:20,996 --> 01:23:23,090
And we must have gone
20 rounds over that.

1540
01:23:23,248 --> 01:23:25,876
Ties. The whole thing
just became...

1541
01:23:26,043 --> 01:23:27,340
So, you broke up with her.

1542
01:23:27,419 --> 01:23:29,717
No, I just backed away.

1543
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:32,554
Gave her some space.
No big deal, right?

1544
01:23:32,716 --> 01:23:34,263
So I thought.

1545
01:23:34,426 --> 01:23:36,599
Then one night, Amy comes
over to my place...

1546
01:23:36,762 --> 01:23:39,561
with a bottle of bourbon and a
bootleg of this band I love.

1547
01:23:39,723 --> 01:23:42,602
And within two minutes, she's got
my pants around my ankles...

1548
01:23:42,768 --> 01:23:44,236
and she is kneeling down, and...

1549
01:23:44,394 --> 01:23:46,271
I'm sorry. I know
it's your wife.

1550
01:23:46,438 --> 01:23:48,190
You had sex? Yeah, consensual.

1551
01:23:48,357 --> 01:23:50,451
It was rough, but she
was screaming for it.

1552
01:23:50,901 --> 01:23:53,245
Next morning, there's
two cops at my door.

1553
01:23:53,570 --> 01:23:56,369
Amy has wounds that are
consistent with rape.

1554
01:23:56,532 --> 01:23:59,581
Ligature marks on her
wrist, and my semen.

1555
01:23:59,743 --> 01:24:03,293
It looks like I've tied Amy
to my bed, and raped her.

1556
01:24:03,455 --> 01:24:04,798
Me!

1557
01:24:04,957 --> 01:24:06,584
And then, guess what they find.

1558
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:08,798
Headboards of my bed,
one on each side.

1559
01:24:09,211 --> 01:24:10,428
The ties you wouldn't wear.

1560
01:24:10,587 --> 01:24:11,930
You do know your wife.

1561
01:24:12,589 --> 01:24:14,307
Did you ever see her again?
Yeah.

1562
01:24:14,466 --> 01:24:15,888
On TV, last week, with you.

1563
01:24:16,468 --> 01:24:17,765
I thought, "There's Amy.

1564
01:24:17,928 --> 01:24:21,933
"She's graduated from being
raped to being murdered."

1565
01:24:23,475 --> 01:24:24,476
Mmm!

1566
01:24:25,769 --> 01:24:26,889
You been watching this, too?

1567
01:24:26,979 --> 01:24:28,179
<i>Last night's bombshell.</i>

1568
01:24:28,230 --> 01:24:29,231
We just found out...

1569
01:24:29,314 --> 01:24:32,158
<i>Amy Elliott Dunne was, indeed,
pregnant when she went missing.</i>

1570
01:24:32,651 --> 01:24:35,495
<i>Kelly Capitono, this
makes me wanna throw up.</i>

1571
01:24:35,654 --> 01:24:37,054
<i>What is it about a
pregnant woman...</i>

1572
01:24:37,072 --> 01:24:38,494
a <i>woman carrying
life inside her...</i>

1573
01:24:38,657 --> 01:24:40,000
<i>that turns men into animals?</i>

1574
01:24:40,158 --> 01:24:41,660
<i>Ellen, this
is an epidemic.</i>

1575
01:24:41,952 --> 01:24:44,152
<i>The third leading cause of
death among pregnant women...</i>

1576
01:24:44,246 --> 01:24:46,499
<i>is homicide committed by
a boyfriend or husband.</i>

1577
01:24:46,665 --> 01:24:49,418
<i>Let's not forget about
the wife, ever.</i>

1578
01:24:49,585 --> 01:24:53,510
<i>Tonight, we welcome Amy's best
friend, Noelle Hawthorne.</i>

1579
01:24:53,672 --> 01:24:55,925
<i>Thanks for being on
the show, Noelle.</i>

1580
01:24:56,091 --> 01:24:57,263
<i>Thank you, Ellen.</i>

1581
01:24:57,426 --> 01:24:58,803
<i>And let me just say this...</i>

1582
01:24:58,969 --> 01:25:02,439
<i>Amy would have loved you,
and all you do for women.</i>

1583
01:25:02,598 --> 01:25:03,598
<i>Oh, that's nice.</i>

1584
01:25:03,682 --> 01:25:05,684
<i>Why don't you tell us about your
friend, Noelle?</i>

1585
01:25:05,851 --> 01:25:08,274
<i>Amy was so nurturing.</i>

1586
01:25:08,437 --> 01:25:10,690
Oh, I'd love if just once,
someone was like...

1587
01:25:10,856 --> 01:25:12,153
"She was a real rag."

1588
01:25:14,651 --> 01:25:17,120
<i>She was beautiful
and smart and kind.</i>

1589
01:25:17,279 --> 01:25:19,202
Seems like a rich bitch to me.

1590
01:25:19,364 --> 01:25:21,867
What do you mean?
People love her.

1591
01:25:22,034 --> 01:25:24,457
I don't know.
She seems uppity.

1592
01:25:26,163 --> 01:25:28,541
Spoiled rich girl, married
a cheating asshole.

1593
01:25:28,707 --> 01:25:29,799
Paid the ultimate price.

1594
01:25:29,958 --> 01:25:32,211
<i>The only secret
was her husband.</i>

1595
01:25:32,294 --> 01:25:33,295
<i>We never met Nick.</i>

1596
01:25:33,462 --> 01:25:34,964
<i>He never introduced himself.</i>

1597
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:37,383
<i>Why was that, Noelle?
Why do you think?</i>

1598
01:25:37,549 --> 01:25:38,550
<i>I think we know why.</i>

1599
01:25:39,343 --> 01:25:41,471
<i>Because he had a violent temper.</i>

1600
01:25:41,637 --> 01:25:42,638
A little harsh.

1601
01:25:42,721 --> 01:25:44,189
That's life, baby.

1602
01:25:44,348 --> 01:25:45,908
<i>He knew I'd have seen
right through him.</i>

1603
01:25:46,850 --> 01:25:48,067
Don't get me wrong.

1604
01:25:48,226 --> 01:25:49,978
I'm not saying it's
okay he killed her.

1605
01:25:50,145 --> 01:25:53,570
I'm just saying, there
are consequences.

1606
01:25:55,692 --> 01:25:56,692
Fuck, yeah.

1607
01:25:56,735 --> 01:25:59,033
<i>She was so alone.</i>

1608
01:25:59,196 --> 01:26:00,994
<i>And she was so innocent.</i>

1609
01:26:01,156 --> 01:26:04,501
<i>You're a good friend, Noelle. And
you're a good friend of the show.</i>

1610
01:26:04,660 --> 01:26:05,752
Thanks for coming on.

1611
01:26:05,911 --> 01:26:07,391
Please tell me you
landed Tanner Bolt.

1612
01:26:07,412 --> 01:26:09,585
Tanner Bolt landed me.

1613
01:26:09,748 --> 01:26:12,922
I'm gonna try and see Desi
Collings on my way home.

1614
01:26:13,085 --> 01:26:14,928
And, Go...

1615
01:26:15,087 --> 01:26:18,261
Tanner's retainer is $100,000.

1616
01:26:18,715 --> 01:26:20,183
That's just the retainer.

1617
01:26:20,550 --> 01:26:24,054
Listen, I've got $47,000 in savings.
I've got $2,500 in an IRA.

1618
01:26:24,221 --> 01:26:27,191
<i>I'm approved for a second mortgage
on the house. We will go from there.</i>

1619
01:26:27,349 --> 01:26:29,101
Thank you.

1620
01:26:29,267 --> 01:26:30,267
I love you.

1621
01:26:30,310 --> 01:26:31,402
I love you, too.

1622
01:26:31,561 --> 01:26:34,189
<i>Nick keeps his father, who has
Alzheimer's, in a facility.</i>

1623
01:26:34,356 --> 01:26:36,450
<i>Number of times he
visited last year? One.</i>

1624
01:26:36,525 --> 01:26:37,526
Oh, fuck!

1625
01:26:37,609 --> 01:26:40,203
<i>His twin sister, Margo,
well, she is a peach.</i>

1626
01:26:40,362 --> 01:26:42,706
<i>These two spend their days
in the bar Amy bought them.</i>

1627
01:26:43,281 --> 01:26:45,283
<i>Playing what, Lauren?
Playing house?</i>

1628
01:26:45,450 --> 01:26:46,451
What the fuck?

1629
01:26:46,618 --> 01:26:49,292
<i>Twin siblings often
enable and abet.</i>

1630
01:26:49,788 --> 01:26:51,631
<i>While I never examined
Nick, or his sister...</i>

1631
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:54,544
<i>they both seem very, very close.</i>

1632
01:26:54,876 --> 01:26:56,128
It's twin-cest.

1633
01:26:56,461 --> 01:26:59,055
<i>Disturbingly close, Lauren.</i>

1634
01:26:59,214 --> 01:27:01,091
<i>And so, we close
with a question.</i>

1635
01:27:01,258 --> 01:27:02,635
<i>What kind of moral rot...</i>

1636
01:27:02,801 --> 01:27:07,398
<i>allows a beautiful, talented,
kind, smart, loving mother...</i>

1637
01:27:07,556 --> 01:27:11,151
<i>to vanish without the heavens
hearing our outraged cries?</i>

1638
01:27:11,309 --> 01:27:12,389
Can I bum a cigarette? Yeah.

1639
01:27:12,394 --> 01:27:16,149
<i>Amy Elliott Dunne, we care about
you, and we will not forget.</i>

1640
01:27:16,648 --> 01:27:18,742
<i>And you know what
else we won't forget?</i>

1641
01:27:18,900 --> 01:27:21,153
<i>Missouri has the death penalty.</i>

1642
01:27:21,319 --> 01:27:22,491
Amen.

1643
01:27:48,346 --> 01:27:50,519
I'd like to report some
strange activity...

1644
01:27:50,682 --> 01:27:54,186
near the woodshed on the
property of one Margo Dunne.

1645
01:28:35,393 --> 01:28:36,861
Hey-

1646
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:43,447
Mr. Dunne.

1647
01:28:43,527 --> 01:28:44,528
Mr. Collings.

1648
01:28:45,529 --> 01:28:48,499
I know you. I saw you at
the volunteer center.

1649
01:28:48,657 --> 01:28:50,375
I wanted to help.

1650
01:28:51,159 --> 01:28:52,759
Well, I hope you don't
mind me coming by.

1651
01:28:52,911 --> 01:28:56,006
I got your address from this
letter that you wrote my wife.

1652
01:28:56,873 --> 01:29:00,252
Amy and I believe in the
lost art of letter-writing.

1653
01:29:00,418 --> 01:29:04,264
I always wondered why you
kept in touch after...

1654
01:29:04,923 --> 01:29:06,095
everything.

1655
01:29:06,258 --> 01:29:08,556
You were together for two years
in boarding school, right?

1656
01:29:08,718 --> 01:29:10,766
She was my first
serious girlfriend.

1657
01:29:10,929 --> 01:29:12,272
Why did you break up?

1658
01:29:12,347 --> 01:29:13,599
That's a strange question.

1659
01:29:13,765 --> 01:29:15,608
Did you treat her bad?
Did you cheat on her?

1660
01:29:15,767 --> 01:29:16,859
That's a rude question.

1661
01:29:17,018 --> 01:29:18,611
Let me tell you
what Amy told me.

1662
01:29:18,770 --> 01:29:21,614
She dumped you, you
completely unraveled.

1663
01:29:21,773 --> 01:29:23,741
You stalked her, you
threatened her...

1664
01:29:23,900 --> 01:29:27,279
and you attempted suicide in her
bed and were institutionalized.

1665
01:29:27,445 --> 01:29:31,245
Your wife is missing, and you came
all this way to tell me this?

1666
01:29:31,408 --> 01:29:33,627
I thought there might be
another side to this story.

1667
01:29:37,289 --> 01:29:39,132
Mr. Collings.

1668
01:29:41,209 --> 01:29:43,132
Fuck.

1669
01:29:48,758 --> 01:29:51,637
<i>...the missing
persons case of Amy Elliott Dunne.</i>

1670
01:29:51,803 --> 01:29:53,897
<i>She is the beautiful
blonde inspiration...</i>

1671
01:29:53,972 --> 01:29:55,474
<i>for the Amazing Amy
kids' book series.</i>

1672
01:30:12,657 --> 01:30:14,751
You're reading that diary again?

1673
01:30:14,910 --> 01:30:15,911
You know how it ends.

1674
01:30:15,994 --> 01:30:18,338
It interests me.

1675
01:30:18,496 --> 01:30:19,964
Hey, Rhonda.

1676
01:30:20,123 --> 01:30:21,921
"He's gonna kill me." The end.

1677
01:30:22,083 --> 01:30:24,085
Why did he go to his
dad's house to burn it?

1678
01:30:24,252 --> 01:30:25,253
It's private. There's
no one there.

1679
01:30:25,420 --> 01:30:28,094
Why didn't he make sure
it actually burned?

1680
01:30:28,256 --> 01:30:31,100
Because he tripped the alarm. You
were up his ass with a flashlight.

1681
01:30:31,259 --> 01:30:33,478
The whole thing
just feels hinky.

1682
01:30:33,637 --> 01:30:35,605
Like finding an
envelope marked "Clue."

1683
01:30:35,764 --> 01:30:36,765
You ever hear the expression...

1684
01:30:36,932 --> 01:30:38,772
"The simplest answer is
often the correct one"?

1685
01:30:39,476 --> 01:30:41,353
Actually, I've never
found that to be true.

1686
01:30:41,519 --> 01:30:43,317
Good night. Good night.

1687
01:30:45,982 --> 01:30:46,983
Hey-

1688
01:30:56,451 --> 01:30:58,203
Elvis is in Missouri.

1689
01:30:58,370 --> 01:31:00,372
Thank God. Come on in.

1690
01:31:00,538 --> 01:31:02,256
<i>First thing you have
to understand about Amy...</i>

1691
01:31:02,332 --> 01:31:03,458
she loves to teach lessons.

1692
01:31:03,541 --> 01:31:04,633
Play God.

1693
01:31:04,709 --> 01:31:05,881
Yeah, Old Testament God.

1694
01:31:06,044 --> 01:31:07,045
Okay. Keep talking.

1695
01:31:07,128 --> 01:31:08,721
She finds out I've been
cheating on her with Andie...

1696
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:10,348
decides to teach me a lesson.

1697
01:31:10,507 --> 01:31:12,305
Fakes her own death,
frames me for it.

1698
01:31:12,467 --> 01:31:14,561
Blood in the house, credit
cards, life insurance.

1699
01:31:14,719 --> 01:31:15,811
She does the treasure hunt.

1700
01:31:15,971 --> 01:31:17,188
Now, the treasure
hunt is critical.

1701
01:31:17,347 --> 01:31:19,645
She's taking us on a
tour of my infidelities.

1702
01:31:19,724 --> 01:31:20,896
Rubbing my nose in it.

1703
01:31:21,059 --> 01:31:22,982
And she leaves clue number
one for the police...

1704
01:31:23,144 --> 01:31:24,744
which will lead them
back to my office...

1705
01:31:24,896 --> 01:31:27,319
which is a place where
Andie and I would often...

1706
01:31:27,482 --> 01:31:28,699
And she leaves a
pair of red panties.

1707
01:31:28,858 --> 01:31:29,905
Right. Racy, looks bad.

1708
01:31:30,068 --> 01:31:31,661
Clue two. My father's house.

1709
01:31:31,820 --> 01:31:32,946
Another place where
Andie and I...

1710
01:31:33,029 --> 01:31:34,076
would occasionally
have relations.

1711
01:31:34,239 --> 01:31:35,491
Clue three? Woodshed.

1712
01:31:35,657 --> 01:31:37,034
Also a location... Oh, my God.

1713
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:38,827
We had limited options. A hotel.

1714
01:31:38,994 --> 01:31:40,166
Amy would have seen
the credit card bill.

1715
01:31:40,245 --> 01:31:41,445
Put it on Andie's credit card.

1716
01:31:41,538 --> 01:31:42,755
Andie's statement went
right to her parents.

1717
01:31:42,914 --> 01:31:45,337
Ew. Nick, Margo, can we head
over to the little brown house?

1718
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:47,173
This leads us to what?
My dad's house.

1719
01:31:47,335 --> 01:31:49,087
Dad's house is blue.

1720
01:31:50,380 --> 01:31:53,429
After the divorce, when Dad
wasn't coming around...

1721
01:31:53,758 --> 01:31:57,888
I used to pretend that he was
a spy named Mr. Brown, who...

1722
01:31:58,054 --> 01:32:01,604
for the sake of his children's
safety, had to deny their existence.

1723
01:32:01,766 --> 01:32:03,188
You never told me that.

1724
01:32:03,435 --> 01:32:05,108
You told her that?

1725
01:32:05,270 --> 01:32:07,568
We've got incriminating red
panties in your office.

1726
01:32:07,897 --> 01:32:10,297
We've got a Showcase Showdown
worth of crap in your woodshed.

1727
01:32:11,401 --> 01:32:14,621
So, what in God's name is at
your father's house, Nick?

1728
01:32:14,779 --> 01:32:15,826
And be honest.

1729
01:32:15,905 --> 01:32:17,748
I honestly have no idea.

1730
01:32:23,663 --> 01:32:24,835
Well...

1731
01:32:24,914 --> 01:32:28,635
Whatever they found, I think it's
safe to assume that it's very bad.

1732
01:32:30,462 --> 01:32:32,715
<i>We got</i> a <i>lot of
uncontained issues here.</i>

1733
01:32:32,964 --> 01:32:36,059
Nick, do you have any idea as
to what Andie's mindset is?

1734
01:32:36,259 --> 01:32:38,933
Well, we haven't communicated
since the vigil.

1735
01:32:39,095 --> 01:32:40,312
Okay. Amy's parents?

1736
01:32:40,472 --> 01:32:41,940
No, it's... More pressure.

1737
01:32:42,098 --> 01:32:43,441
We got a hurt, young
girlfriend...

1738
01:32:43,516 --> 01:32:45,314
who will no doubt go
public at any moment.

1739
01:32:45,393 --> 01:32:46,770
No, Andie won't do that.
She will.

1740
01:32:46,936 --> 01:32:48,654
They always do. Don't
take it personally.

1741
01:32:49,147 --> 01:32:51,320
Amy's got us in an
interesting bind.

1742
01:32:51,649 --> 01:32:52,741
We need to tell the
cops about Andie.

1743
01:32:52,817 --> 01:32:53,818
Really?

1744
01:32:53,985 --> 01:32:56,158
Right now, Andie just
gives you another motive.

1745
01:32:56,988 --> 01:32:58,160
We need to tell the cops
about the woodshed.

1746
01:32:58,448 --> 01:32:59,745
We need to be on the
front end of that.

1747
01:32:59,908 --> 01:33:02,252
But I'm gonna warn you
as to what will happen.

1748
01:33:02,827 --> 01:33:03,919
They'll go after Margo.

1749
01:33:04,037 --> 01:33:05,038
They can't do that, can they?

1750
01:33:05,121 --> 01:33:06,919
She's your accomplice. She
helped you hide the evidence.

1751
01:33:07,082 --> 01:33:09,176
In all likelihood, she
knows that you killed Amy.

1752
01:33:10,085 --> 01:33:11,507
Oh, God.

1753
01:33:11,836 --> 01:33:13,804
Well, what are we going to do?

1754
01:33:13,963 --> 01:33:15,180
We find Amy.

1755
01:33:15,256 --> 01:33:17,475
No. Any other strategy
is missing the point.

1756
01:33:17,634 --> 01:33:19,874
I've got two ex-Secret Service
guys that are really good.

1757
01:33:20,011 --> 01:33:21,513
I'll put them on it.

1758
01:33:21,679 --> 01:33:23,101
But where do they start, Nick?

1759
01:33:23,473 --> 01:33:24,599
Where would Amy go?

1760
01:33:26,768 --> 01:33:28,395
I have no idea.

1761
01:33:30,855 --> 01:33:31,856
Oh!

1762
01:33:32,857 --> 01:33:35,485
Are we keeping score?

1763
01:33:36,152 --> 01:33:37,529
Hey!

1764
01:33:39,155 --> 01:33:42,204
I thought we were steering
clear of men for a while.

1765
01:33:42,325 --> 01:33:43,325
He's nice.

1766
01:33:43,368 --> 01:33:45,871
Because he wants to fuck you.

1767
01:33:47,497 --> 01:33:49,044
She's still moping about her ex?

1768
01:33:50,834 --> 01:33:53,508
He got cheated on, too.

1769
01:33:56,881 --> 01:33:59,634
We three are the saddest
sacks in all the Ozarks.

1770
01:33:59,801 --> 01:34:01,348
I'm not sad.

1771
01:34:01,803 --> 01:34:02,804
I'm angry-

1772
01:34:02,887 --> 01:34:04,560
There you go.

1773
01:34:04,722 --> 01:34:07,225
I almost drank myself to
death when my wife left me.

1774
01:34:07,392 --> 01:34:09,520
I was gonna kill myself.
Can you believe that?

1775
01:34:09,686 --> 01:34:10,806
Don't give him the pleasure.

1776
01:34:10,854 --> 01:34:13,858
I was going to drown myself
in the Gulf of Mexico...

1777
01:34:14,023 --> 01:34:16,401
let myself be dinner
for the great whites.

1778
01:34:16,568 --> 01:34:18,241
Gulf is bull sharks,
Miss Nawlins.

1779
01:34:18,403 --> 01:34:22,203
Why should I die? I'm
not the asshole.

1780
01:34:22,365 --> 01:34:24,834
Please
put that on a T-shirt.

1781
01:34:26,369 --> 01:34:27,370
Oh!

1782
01:34:33,376 --> 01:34:35,754
Miss Moneybags. l thought
you said you were broke.

1783
01:34:37,255 --> 01:34:38,552
That's a fat wad.

1784
01:34:40,341 --> 01:34:42,014
It's mostly singles.

1785
01:34:42,177 --> 01:34:44,054
Singles? What are
you, a stripper?

1786
01:34:44,846 --> 01:34:47,440
Swamp Girls, or Treasure Chest?

1787
01:34:48,558 --> 01:34:49,605
We're just teasing.

1788
01:34:50,393 --> 01:34:52,191
Don't they tease
people down in NOLA?

1789
01:34:54,606 --> 01:34:57,450
<i><i> We can expect
Nick Dunne's arrest any day now.</i>

1790
01:34:57,609 --> 01:35:01,204
<i>We've got blood in the house,
huge debt, an unwanted pregnancy.</i>

1791
01:35:01,362 --> 01:35:05,208
<i>And we have Amy Elliott Dunne,
missing for five days...</i>

1792
01:35:05,366 --> 01:35:07,494
<i>crying out for justice.</i>

1793
01:35:08,286 --> 01:35:10,004
<i>We'll be right back.</i>

1794
01:36:02,257 --> 01:36:04,601
Tanner has a very bad idea
he's going to pitch you.

1795
01:36:04,676 --> 01:36:05,676
Yeah?

1796
01:36:05,718 --> 01:36:07,186
You're doing Sharon Schieber
tomorrow in St. Louis.

1797
01:36:07,345 --> 01:36:08,345
It could go so wrong.

1798
01:36:08,388 --> 01:36:10,028
And you are going to
tell her about Andie.

1799
01:36:10,181 --> 01:36:11,353
Nope. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1800
01:36:11,516 --> 01:36:13,393
That sounds like
a very bad idea.

1801
01:36:13,559 --> 01:36:15,527
You haven't heard from
her in three days.

1802
01:36:15,687 --> 01:36:19,282
This is a ticking time bomb.
You've gotta throw yourself on it.

1803
01:36:19,440 --> 01:36:20,441
People are gonna hate me.

1804
01:36:20,525 --> 01:36:21,868
And then, they will forgive you.

1805
01:36:22,026 --> 01:36:24,370
A guy admitting that he's a
gigantic asshole on television?

1806
01:36:24,529 --> 01:36:26,202
People empathize with that.

1807
01:36:27,615 --> 01:36:29,413
Why don't we just put out a statement?
They need to see you.

1808
01:36:29,575 --> 01:36:32,545
Sharon's specials, they
get 10 million viewers.

1809
01:36:32,704 --> 01:36:35,082
She is a crusader. If she
takes you on as a cause...

1810
01:36:35,248 --> 01:36:37,046
She's going to ask
real questions.

1811
01:36:37,208 --> 01:36:38,926
I will drill you as if you
were doing a deposition.

1812
01:36:39,085 --> 01:36:40,428
What to say, what not to say.

1813
01:36:40,586 --> 01:36:41,587
A trained monkey?

1814
01:36:41,754 --> 01:36:43,914
A trained monkey who doesn't
get the lethal injection.

1815
01:36:45,133 --> 01:36:48,478
Nick, this case is about
what people think of you.

1816
01:36:48,636 --> 01:36:50,263
They need to like you.

1817
01:36:50,430 --> 01:36:54,276
Now, you do this and you will
reach millions of those people.

1818
01:36:55,435 --> 01:36:57,938
Maybe I only need to reach one.

1819
01:37:07,155 --> 01:37:08,156
Hello?

1820
01:37:08,239 --> 01:37:09,456
Hey, baby.

1821
01:37:10,908 --> 01:37:12,501
One minute.

1822
01:37:21,252 --> 01:37:22,595
Hey. Hey-

1823
01:37:22,670 --> 01:37:23,671
You clearing out?

1824
01:37:23,755 --> 01:37:25,473
No, I'm just cleaning up.

1825
01:37:25,631 --> 01:37:27,099
Let us come in and say goodbye.

1826
01:37:27,258 --> 01:37:28,259
I'll come by before...

1827
01:37:28,343 --> 01:37:30,095
Let us give you a hand.

1828
01:37:36,267 --> 01:37:38,736
Yeah, you gotta clear
everything out, here.

1829
01:37:40,396 --> 01:37:43,115
Dorothy is a real stickler.

1830
01:37:44,442 --> 01:37:47,742
Not even a spare hanger
can you leave behind.

1831
01:37:50,323 --> 01:37:51,883
Gotta make sure nothing's
tucked inside.

1832
01:37:54,410 --> 01:37:55,411
A sock...

1833
01:37:56,329 --> 01:37:59,128
or undies or what have you.

1834
01:38:03,961 --> 01:38:05,304
You did a real good job.

1835
01:38:07,298 --> 01:38:09,426
Where is the money, sweetheart?

1836
01:38:13,096 --> 01:38:14,097
Look under her dress.

1837
01:38:15,640 --> 01:38:16,766
He talked you into this?

1838
01:38:16,933 --> 01:38:18,150
I talked him into it.

1839
01:38:18,309 --> 01:38:20,311
The second you leave,
I'm calling the cops.

1840
01:38:20,812 --> 01:38:24,362
Your glasses are fake. Your
hair's dyed all hamster.

1841
01:38:24,524 --> 01:38:27,494
You say your name's Nancy, but you
don't even answer to it half the time.

1842
01:38:27,652 --> 01:38:29,996
You're hiding. I don't know
why, and I don't really care.

1843
01:38:30,154 --> 01:38:32,202
But you ain't gonna
call the cops.

1844
01:38:32,532 --> 01:38:34,612
And I don't think you've
ever really been hit before.

1845
01:38:34,617 --> 01:38:35,743
Ow!

1846
01:38:40,832 --> 01:38:42,834
Holy shit.

1847
01:38:45,878 --> 01:38:48,552
Sorry, but we really
need the money.

1848
01:38:48,714 --> 01:38:50,314
Next place, be
more careful, okay?

1849
01:38:50,383 --> 01:38:52,783
There are a lot of people out
there a lot worse than we are.

1850
01:39:27,336 --> 01:39:28,963
Excuse me. You
can't sleep here.

1851
01:39:56,574 --> 01:39:59,669
I did not kill my wife.

1852
01:40:00,661 --> 01:40:03,835
Why don't you try it again?
A little less wooden.

1853
01:40:03,998 --> 01:40:05,090
I didn't kill my Wife.

1854
01:40:06,918 --> 01:40:08,511
What are you doing? Every
time you look smug...

1855
01:40:08,669 --> 01:40:11,218
or annoyed or tense, I'm gonna
hit you with a gummy bear.

1856
01:40:11,380 --> 01:40:13,223
That's supposed to make me less tense?
Let's try it again.

1857
01:40:13,382 --> 01:40:14,929
Mr. Dunne, from what
I understand...

1858
01:40:15,009 --> 01:40:16,682
you and your wife
had some bumps.

1859
01:40:17,720 --> 01:40:21,566
Yeah, we had some tough years.
Um, I lost my job.

1860
01:40:21,724 --> 01:40:22,725
You both did.

1861
01:40:25,436 --> 01:40:27,188
We both lost our jobs.

1862
01:40:27,355 --> 01:40:29,795
I had to move back home so we
could take care of my mother...

1863
01:40:29,941 --> 01:40:32,364
who was dying of cancer
and my dad, who had...

1864
01:40:32,527 --> 01:40:34,154
Your dad's scorched earth.

1865
01:40:34,320 --> 01:40:35,867
Let's talk about your
mom, how close you were.

1866
01:40:36,030 --> 01:40:37,077
Go on.

1867
01:40:37,240 --> 01:40:39,618
For a while, things
had been building up.

1868
01:40:39,784 --> 01:40:43,163
"Built up" implies that an
explosion is coming. No.

1869
01:40:43,329 --> 01:40:45,752
At a certain point, we
got on the wrong track.

1870
01:40:46,582 --> 01:40:48,084
I had a moment of weakness.

1871
01:40:48,251 --> 01:40:50,674
Your "moment" was
over 15 months.

1872
01:40:54,465 --> 01:40:56,559
I disrespected my wife.

1873
01:40:57,218 --> 01:40:59,641
And I disrespected my marriage.

1874
01:41:00,096 --> 01:41:01,473
And I'll always regret it.

1875
01:41:01,973 --> 01:41:03,020
That works.

1876
01:41:03,099 --> 01:41:05,397
Don't be afraid to play up the
dufus husband thing, Nick.

1877
01:41:05,560 --> 01:41:07,107
"I was an idiot. I'm a fuck-up.

1878
01:41:07,186 --> 01:41:08,266
"Everything I do is wrong."

1879
01:41:08,271 --> 01:41:10,239
I know. What men are
supposed to do in general.

1880
01:41:12,191 --> 01:41:13,238
How do you feel?

1881
01:41:13,442 --> 01:41:16,662
I feel good. Go, can you
pass me that box, please?

1882
01:41:17,071 --> 01:41:19,574
It's Amy's 33rd
birthday present to me.

1883
01:41:19,699 --> 01:41:20,700
You hate that watch.

1884
01:41:20,783 --> 01:41:22,751
No, Go. I love that watch.

1885
01:41:22,910 --> 01:41:24,787
Just like I love this tie.

1886
01:41:24,954 --> 01:41:28,083
Just like I love my wife.

1887
01:41:58,446 --> 01:41:59,698
It's you!

1888
01:41:59,864 --> 01:42:01,866
It's you.

1889
01:42:02,700 --> 01:42:04,702
I'm sorry.

1890
01:42:05,369 --> 01:42:06,712
I'm sorry.

1891
01:42:07,622 --> 01:42:09,499
Good God.

1892
01:42:09,665 --> 01:42:11,042
Last week...

1893
01:42:11,542 --> 01:42:15,297
I threatened to leave, and
he said he'd find me...

1894
01:42:15,379 --> 01:42:16,722
and he'd kill me.

1895
01:42:17,048 --> 01:42:19,221
So, I disappeared.

1896
01:42:20,384 --> 01:42:22,227
I lost the baby.

1897
01:42:22,720 --> 01:42:24,393
I couldn't even tell my parents.

1898
01:42:24,555 --> 01:42:28,480
I'm so ashamed
and I'm so afraid.

1899
01:42:29,226 --> 01:42:30,398
Well, he is looking for you.

1900
01:42:31,062 --> 01:42:32,905
He showed up on my
doorstep three days ago.

1901
01:42:33,064 --> 01:42:35,567
He tracked me from
my letters to you.

1902
01:42:36,692 --> 01:42:37,909
You saved them.

1903
01:42:38,486 --> 01:42:39,487
Knowing you were out there...

1904
01:42:39,570 --> 01:42:42,073
was the only thing that's kept
me going these past few years.

1905
01:42:42,239 --> 01:42:43,582
Let's go to the police. You
can explain everything.

1906
01:42:43,658 --> 01:42:44,830
No, I can't turn up now.

1907
01:42:44,992 --> 01:42:48,087
I'd be a pariah.
Everyone would hate me.

1908
01:42:49,914 --> 01:42:52,087
Is it wrong to want
Nick to go prison?

1909
01:42:52,249 --> 01:42:54,047
He should go to prison
for what he's done.

1910
01:42:56,921 --> 01:42:59,265
I'm setting you up
at my lake house.

1911
01:42:59,423 --> 01:43:00,424
It's utterly secluded.

1912
01:43:01,842 --> 01:43:03,560
Why are you so good to me?

1913
01:43:03,719 --> 01:43:04,936
You know why.

1914
01:43:05,096 --> 01:43:06,097
Excuse me.

1915
01:43:06,263 --> 01:43:07,264
I know you, don't I?

1916
01:43:07,348 --> 01:43:08,349
No.

1917
01:43:08,432 --> 01:43:10,105
You're one of the
Nolan girls, right?

1918
01:43:10,267 --> 01:43:12,941
No, we're from Winnipeg.
Excuse us. Oh.

1919
01:43:13,020 --> 01:43:14,021
We should leave.

1920
01:43:14,105 --> 01:43:15,545
Just a second.

1921
01:43:15,773 --> 01:43:18,902
That was Boney. I'll
call her later.

1922
01:43:19,068 --> 01:43:20,945
Tannen Nice to see you.

1923
01:43:21,237 --> 01:43:22,238
Sharon! Hi.

1924
01:43:22,405 --> 01:43:23,952
Hope this is worth my while.

1925
01:43:24,115 --> 01:43:25,241
You're gonna be very happy.

1926
01:43:25,449 --> 01:43:26,450
Sharon.

1927
01:43:26,534 --> 01:43:28,628
Ms. Schieber. Thank you
so much for doing this.

1928
01:43:28,786 --> 01:43:30,788
Can I get you anything to drink
or eat before we get started?

1929
01:43:30,955 --> 01:43:32,957
No, I had some gummy bears.

1930
01:43:34,041 --> 01:43:35,634
What the fuck?

1931
01:43:36,794 --> 01:43:37,920
I'm sorry?

1932
01:43:38,337 --> 01:43:40,385
<i>We have a
major shocking development...</i>

1933
01:43:40,464 --> 01:43:42,091
<i>in the Amazing Amy
disappearance.</i>

1934
01:43:42,258 --> 01:43:43,510
<i>We go live to that story now.</i>

1935
01:43:43,676 --> 01:43:44,973
Oh, my God.

1936
01:43:47,138 --> 01:43:48,811
You little slut.

1937
01:43:48,973 --> 01:43:51,977
<i>My name is Andie Fitzgerald.</i>

1938
01:43:52,977 --> 01:43:54,524
<i>I met Nicholas Dunne...</i>

1939
01:43:54,687 --> 01:43:58,191
<i>when he was my creative writing
teacher at Mill Valley.</i>

1940
01:43:58,357 --> 01:44:00,325
Why is she dressed
like a babysitter?

1941
01:44:00,484 --> 01:44:01,827
<i>I am deeply ashamed...</i>

1942
01:44:01,986 --> 01:44:04,990
<i>of having been romantically
involved with a married man.</i>

1943
01:44:05,156 --> 01:44:06,954
The girl with the
giant cum-on-me tits.

1944
01:44:07,116 --> 01:44:08,993
<i>I truly believed
we were in love.</i>

1945
01:44:09,160 --> 01:44:11,003
Now, she looks like a
fucking Mennonite.

1946
01:44:12,496 --> 01:44:13,839
<i>I know that is no excuse.</i>

1947
01:44:13,998 --> 01:44:15,170
No, it is not.

1948
01:44:15,332 --> 01:44:19,553
<i>I do not, in my heart, believe Nick
Dunne would have killed for me.</i>

1949
01:44:19,712 --> 01:44:22,010
<i>My prayers go out to
everyone who loves Amy.</i>

1950
01:44:22,173 --> 01:44:25,177
<i>I apologize for the pain
this has caused them.</i>

1951
01:44:30,389 --> 01:44:32,357
<i>We have loved Nick
Dunne like a son.</i>

1952
01:44:33,184 --> 01:44:34,561
<i>That love ended today.</i>

1953
01:44:34,852 --> 01:44:36,354
Come on, you're
staring at ghosts.

1954
01:44:36,520 --> 01:44:39,194
<i>He met our trust
with lie after lie.</i>

1955
01:44:39,523 --> 01:44:41,321
<i>We now absolutely believe...</i>

1956
01:44:41,484 --> 01:44:43,737
<i>Nick is involved in the
disappearance of our daughter.</i>

1957
01:44:43,903 --> 01:44:46,156
<i>Our Amazing Amy.</i>

1958
01:44:47,031 --> 01:44:49,159
Well, this just got
very exciting.

1959
01:44:49,867 --> 01:44:51,585
We need a moment.

1960
01:44:53,579 --> 01:44:55,206
We're gonna have to
bow out of this.

1961
01:44:55,372 --> 01:44:57,092
Nothing has changed.
Everything has changed.

1962
01:44:57,208 --> 01:44:59,506
An hour ago, we were ahead of this.
Now?

1963
01:44:59,668 --> 01:45:01,228
I can handle this.
We're on the defense.

1964
01:45:01,337 --> 01:45:03,260
This is a completely
different dynamic.

1965
01:45:03,422 --> 01:45:04,514
I can handle it.

1966
01:45:04,590 --> 01:45:06,183
She's going to eat you alive.

1967
01:45:06,717 --> 01:45:08,390
Just trust me.

1968
01:45:12,765 --> 01:45:14,017
Okay-

1969
01:45:14,183 --> 01:45:15,275
Great.

1970
01:45:16,101 --> 01:45:17,569
Mic him.

1971
01:45:37,289 --> 01:45:39,087
One, two, three, four, five.

1972
01:45:45,089 --> 01:45:46,090
Thank you.

1973
01:45:47,591 --> 01:45:48,763
He shouldn't smile at
the makeup artist.

1974
01:45:48,884 --> 01:45:49,931
Yeah, no kidding.

1975
01:45:54,598 --> 01:45:57,602
Roll tape.
Five... four...

1976
01:45:57,768 --> 01:45:59,395
three... two...

1977
01:46:01,605 --> 01:46:04,404
Seriously, I can't believe
how fucking good you were.

1978
01:46:04,567 --> 01:46:06,007
Amy brings out the best in me.
Don't.

1979
01:46:06,068 --> 01:46:07,536
Keep it
together, you two.

1980
01:46:07,611 --> 01:46:09,113
At least for the next 24 hours.

1981
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:10,372
People still hate you.

1982
01:46:10,447 --> 01:46:11,573
Women want to scratch
your eyes out.

1983
01:46:11,740 --> 01:46:13,492
Andie was really good TV.

1984
01:46:13,576 --> 01:46:14,576
She's a good person.

1985
01:46:14,618 --> 01:46:15,665
Therein lies the problem.

1986
01:46:15,744 --> 01:46:16,744
Ride this out...

1987
01:46:16,787 --> 01:46:18,209
and when Sharon airs tomorrow,

1988
01:46:18,289 --> 01:46:19,689
we'll be looking at
a whole new you.

1989
01:46:19,832 --> 01:46:21,300
But, until then...

1990
01:46:21,458 --> 01:46:23,301
don't show your face.

1991
01:46:23,460 --> 01:46:25,303
No problem.

1992
01:46:41,604 --> 01:46:42,981
Welcome.

1993
01:46:44,982 --> 01:46:46,700
Make yourself at home.

1994
01:46:46,859 --> 01:46:50,705
I've got music, satellite...

1995
01:46:50,779 --> 01:46:51,779
Netflix.

1996
01:46:51,822 --> 01:46:52,823
<i>He was her teacher!</i>

1997
01:46:52,907 --> 01:46:53,908
Roku.

1998
01:46:54,533 --> 01:46:57,036
Internet, obviously.

1999
01:46:57,620 --> 01:47:00,214
<i>Here is a supposedly
grown man...</i>

2000
01:47:00,372 --> 01:47:02,795
If there is ever anything
you have a taste for...

2001
01:47:02,875 --> 01:47:04,127
and you can't find it...

2002
01:47:04,209 --> 01:47:06,337
just let me know and I
will get it for you.

2003
01:47:06,503 --> 01:47:09,507
<i>Instead of the A-B-C's, he
taught her the birds and the bees.</i>

2004
01:47:09,673 --> 01:47:12,472
<i>And just think how her mother
must feel at a time like this.</i>

2005
01:47:12,635 --> 01:47:14,637
Wine cellar's downstairs.

2006
01:47:18,098 --> 01:47:19,350
L'll get you some clothes, too.

2007
01:47:19,516 --> 01:47:22,941
Not that I don't
appreciate Bait Shop Chic.

2008
01:47:24,104 --> 01:47:26,482
The floors are heated,
just dial to your liking.

2009
01:47:26,649 --> 01:47:29,698
There's robes and towels.
The shower has steam.

2010
01:47:29,860 --> 01:47:32,204
The bathtub has a massage cycle.

2011
01:47:34,031 --> 01:47:35,954
There's a great view,
if you're in the mood.

2012
01:47:36,116 --> 01:47:37,538
Blackout curtains if you're not.

2013
01:47:37,701 --> 01:47:40,045
The bed is Savoir.

2014
01:47:40,204 --> 01:47:42,457
You'll never get a better sleep.

2015
01:47:43,666 --> 01:47:44,667
Oh.

2016
01:47:46,335 --> 01:47:48,679
Oh, this is just what I need.

2017
01:47:50,130 --> 01:47:52,053
I'm so exhausted.

2018
01:47:53,550 --> 01:47:55,723
I'll leave you to it, then.

2019
01:47:57,471 --> 01:48:00,224
Amy, l am so happy
that you are here.

2020
01:48:01,392 --> 01:48:04,236
And I don't want you to
worry for one moment.

2021
01:48:04,395 --> 01:48:06,238
There are cameras everywhere.

2022
01:48:06,397 --> 01:48:09,150
The exterior, all along the
grounds, the entryway.

2023
01:48:09,316 --> 01:48:10,363
Anyone...

2024
01:48:10,484 --> 01:48:12,737
who is caught coming or going...

2025
01:48:15,990 --> 01:48:17,583
will be recorded.

2026
01:48:18,075 --> 01:48:19,076
Ah.

2027
01:48:19,159 --> 01:48:21,878
You are more than safe.

2028
01:48:23,831 --> 01:48:27,335
And I am not letting
you get away again.

2029
01:49:12,629 --> 01:49:13,676
Good morning!

2030
01:49:13,756 --> 01:49:14,757
Don't do that!

2031
01:49:16,425 --> 01:49:17,551
I'm sorry.

2032
01:49:19,553 --> 01:49:21,055
I need to feel safe.

2033
01:49:21,388 --> 01:49:24,392
You are very safe.

2034
01:49:26,602 --> 01:49:28,104
What have you been up to?
Nothing.

2035
01:49:28,270 --> 01:49:30,864
Amy, I'm not Nick.

2036
01:49:31,023 --> 01:49:33,025
It's hard for me.

2037
01:49:35,944 --> 01:49:39,574
After so many years under
someone's thumb...

2038
01:49:41,825 --> 01:49:43,122
I know just what
that feels like.

2039
01:49:44,036 --> 01:49:46,038
You were never under my thumb.

2040
01:49:46,622 --> 01:49:48,545
On your leash. Never

2041
01:49:48,707 --> 01:49:50,209
A new start.

2042
01:49:51,502 --> 01:49:53,129
Decent clothes.

2043
01:49:54,046 --> 01:49:56,299
Hair dye. Makeup. Tweezers.

2044
01:49:56,590 --> 01:49:58,092
There's a gym
overlooking the lake.

2045
01:49:58,467 --> 01:50:00,185
The sooner you look
like yourself...

2046
01:50:00,260 --> 01:50:01,887
the sooner you'll
feel like yourself.

2047
01:50:02,054 --> 01:50:03,351
I'll get groceries
for tonight...

2048
01:50:03,430 --> 01:50:05,057
we'll watch Sharon Schieber,
and finally move on.

2049
01:50:05,224 --> 01:50:07,773
I think that's something I
should watch on my own.

2050
01:50:08,185 --> 01:50:09,903
Nonsense.

2051
01:50:13,524 --> 01:50:14,946
I'll be back.

2052
01:50:16,568 --> 01:50:18,616
And I am looking forward...

2053
01:50:18,779 --> 01:50:21,703
to my reunion with Amy Elliott.

2054
01:50:44,888 --> 01:50:46,060
Great.

2055
01:50:47,099 --> 01:50:49,067
<i>Good evening, I'm
Sharon Schieber.</i>

2056
01:50:49,226 --> 01:50:50,853
<i>Tonight, exclusively...
Hurry up.</i>

2057
01:50:51,770 --> 01:50:53,568
<i>A husband breaks his silence...</i>

2058
01:50:53,647 --> 01:50:56,025
<i>not just on his wife's
disappearance...</i>

2059
01:50:56,191 --> 01:50:59,991
<i>but on his infidelity, and
all those shocking rumors.</i>

2060
01:51:02,447 --> 01:51:03,869
<i>Nick Dunne...</i>

2061
01:51:04,032 --> 01:51:07,411
<i>you're probably the most hated
man in America right now.</i>

2062
01:51:07,578 --> 01:51:10,047
<i>I probably am. And I
probably deserve it.</i>

2063
01:51:10,205 --> 01:51:11,673
I bought that tie.

2064
01:51:11,832 --> 01:51:13,755
<i>Did you kill your Wife, Nick?</i>

2065
01:51:13,917 --> 01:51:17,012
<i>I did not kill my wife.</i>

2066
01:51:17,671 --> 01:51:19,093
<i>I am not a murderer.</i>

2067
01:51:19,256 --> 01:51:21,054
<i>But you were unfaithful.</i>

2068
01:51:21,216 --> 01:51:23,310
<i>I was unfaithful.</i>

2069
01:51:23,468 --> 01:51:25,015
<i>And I am deeply ashamed.</i>

2070
01:51:25,179 --> 01:51:27,523
<i>And, on top of that,
you allowed Amy's parents...</i>

2071
01:51:27,806 --> 01:51:30,434
<i>her friends, all the
people in your hometown...</i>

2072
01:51:30,601 --> 01:51:33,150
<i>believe you were a
loving husband,</i>

2073
01:51:33,228 --> 01:51:35,401
<i>desperate to find
his missing wife.</i>

2074
01:51:35,564 --> 01:51:37,324
<i>Well, I am desperate to
find my missing wife.</i>

2075
01:51:37,482 --> 01:51:38,859
<i>You say that, but
I'm wondering...</i>

2076
01:51:38,942 --> 01:51:40,364
<i>how you expect us
to believe you...</i>

2077
01:51:40,527 --> 01:51:42,245
<i>now that we know you're a liar.</i>

2078
01:51:42,529 --> 01:51:45,533
<i>I didn't come forward
with my affair...</i>

2079
01:51:45,699 --> 01:51:48,873
<i>because I knew it would make
me look really, really bad.</i>

2080
01:51:49,703 --> 01:51:51,376
<i>But I don't care
about that anymore.</i>

2081
01:51:51,538 --> 01:51:53,040
<i>I just want to find my wife.</i>

2082
01:51:53,207 --> 01:51:54,550
<i>I'm just
trying to get clear...</i>

2083
01:51:54,625 --> 01:51:55,626
<i>Let me be clear.</i>

2084
01:51:55,792 --> 01:52:00,093
<i>Just because l am not a murderer
doesn't make me a good guy.</i>

2085
01:52:00,255 --> 01:52:01,427
<i>I'm not a good guy.</i>

2086
01:52:01,840 --> 01:52:04,309
<i>I was a bad husband
to a great wife.</i>

2087
01:52:04,676 --> 01:52:06,428
<i>I broke the vow
that I made to her.</i>

2088
01:52:06,678 --> 01:52:09,227
<i>Those are pretty words, Nick.</i>

2089
01:52:09,556 --> 01:52:11,183
<i>But what does that
really mean to you?</i>

2090
01:52:11,350 --> 01:52:13,398
<i>It basically means that
I was a con artist.</i>

2091
01:52:14,353 --> 01:52:17,448
<i>I met Amy Elliott
seven years</i> ago.

2092
01:52:17,606 --> 01:52:19,199
<i>I was completely transfixed.</i>

2093
01:52:19,650 --> 01:52:21,448
<i>Amy can do that to you.</i>

2094
01:52:21,610 --> 01:52:24,033
<i>I was this average guy
from an average place...</i>

2095
01:52:24,196 --> 01:52:26,073
<i>with mediocre aspirations.</i>

2096
01:52:26,240 --> 01:52:28,618
<i>And I met a woman
who dazzled me.</i>

2097
01:52:28,784 --> 01:52:30,627
<i>And I wanted her to love me...</i>

2098
01:52:30,786 --> 01:52:33,130
<i>so I pretended to be
better than I was.</i>

2099
01:52:33,997 --> 01:52:37,547
<i>When we got married, I
promised to be that guy.</i>

2100
01:52:37,709 --> 01:52:39,427
<i>That guy who works harder.</i>

2101
01:52:39,586 --> 01:52:41,680
<i>That guy who, who
lives and acts...</i>

2102
01:52:41,838 --> 01:52:44,762
<i>and loves with as much
passion as she does.</i>

2103
01:52:45,008 --> 01:52:46,328
<i>But I failed her.</i>

2104
01:52:47,135 --> 01:52:48,455
<i>Instead of doing
what was right...</i>

2105
01:52:49,763 --> 01:52:50,935
<i>I did what was easy.</i>

2106
01:52:51,682 --> 01:52:55,186
<i>You talk like a man who believes
he can make amends to his wife.</i>

2107
01:52:55,352 --> 01:52:56,854
<i>Who believes his
wife is still alive.</i>

2108
01:52:57,020 --> 01:52:58,317
<i>She is still alive.</i>

2109
01:53:00,190 --> 01:53:03,034
<i>Will you look at
that camera for me?</i>

2110
01:53:03,360 --> 01:53:06,204
<i>Will you look in the lens...</i>

2111
01:53:06,363 --> 01:53:08,206
<i>and talk to your wife?</i>

2112
01:53:08,365 --> 01:53:11,335
<i>If she is out there, able to
hear and see you tonight...</i>

2113
01:53:11,493 --> 01:53:14,167
<i>what would you like
to say to her, Nick?</i>

2114
01:53:17,708 --> 01:53:20,006
<i>Amy, I love you.</i>

2115
01:53:20,711 --> 01:53:23,385
<i>You're the best person
I've ever known.</i>

2116
01:53:23,547 --> 01:53:25,720
<i>And I've taken myself
to the woodshed...</i>

2117
01:53:25,799 --> 01:53:27,893
<i>for the way that
I've treated you.</i>

2118
01:53:28,051 --> 01:53:29,894
<i>And if you come
back, I promise...</i>

2119
01:53:30,053 --> 01:53:32,556
<i>I will spend every day
making it up to you.</i>

2120
01:53:33,056 --> 01:53:36,902
<i>I will be the man that I
promised you I would be.</i>

2121
01:53:39,479 --> 01:53:40,480
<i>I love you.</i>

2122
01:53:41,398 --> 01:53:42,991
<i>Come home.</i>

2123
01:53:47,738 --> 01:53:48,739
Here.

2124
01:53:54,870 --> 01:53:56,470
<i>Regardless of
what you thought...</i>

2125
01:53:56,538 --> 01:53:58,586
What does it say?

2126
01:53:58,749 --> 01:54:00,171
<i>I think we can all agree...</i>

2127
01:54:00,334 --> 01:54:01,711
Oh, my God. You
fucking killed it.

2128
01:54:01,877 --> 01:54:02,924
<i>There's more to him
than meets the eye.</i>

2129
01:54:03,086 --> 01:54:04,206
They're going crazy for you.

2130
01:54:04,212 --> 01:54:08,592
They disliked me, they
liked me, they hated me.

2131
01:54:08,759 --> 01:54:10,261
And now they love me.

2132
01:54:10,427 --> 01:54:13,271
a <i>candor and an honesty
that's worthy of respect.</i>

2133
01:54:13,430 --> 01:54:15,353
<i>He's certainly earned mine.</i>

2134
01:54:16,183 --> 01:54:17,275
What is it?

2135
01:54:20,103 --> 01:54:23,232
<i>I'm Sharon Schieber. Good night.</i>

2136
01:54:28,195 --> 01:54:30,869
Margo Dunne, this is a search
warrant for your property.

2137
01:54:31,031 --> 01:54:33,125
I usually ignore
tipline calls...

2138
01:54:33,283 --> 01:54:35,160
but a neighbor was
concerned about...

2139
01:54:35,243 --> 01:54:37,871
a strange man around
your woodshed.

2140
01:54:38,246 --> 01:54:39,246
Call Tanner.

2141
01:54:39,289 --> 01:54:40,461
Okay. Fuck!

2142
01:54:44,586 --> 01:54:46,054
Girlfriend's real cute, Nick.

2143
01:54:47,297 --> 01:54:48,377
Is that what this is about?

2144
01:54:49,800 --> 01:54:51,768
I have treated you
more than fair...

2145
01:54:51,843 --> 01:54:54,437
throughout this
entire investigation.

2146
01:54:54,596 --> 01:54:56,769
I gave you the benefit of
the doubt over and over.

2147
01:54:56,932 --> 01:54:58,452
Every time you said
something stupid...

2148
01:54:58,475 --> 01:55:00,728
I thought, "Maybe
he's just stupid."

2149
01:55:00,894 --> 01:55:03,317
But I was wrong. That's
what this is about.

2150
01:55:03,480 --> 01:55:04,481
Are these the clubs you
don't play golf with?

2151
01:55:04,648 --> 01:55:05,649
None of that is mine.

2152
01:55:05,941 --> 01:55:07,409
None of this was put here by me.

2153
01:55:07,567 --> 01:55:10,992
Those are nice clubs. You got
the makings of a real man cave.

2154
01:55:11,154 --> 01:55:14,158
Everything just waiting until
the wife goes away for good.

2155
01:55:14,324 --> 01:55:15,416
Nick!

2156
01:55:16,660 --> 01:55:18,037
Hey, you can't do that!

2157
01:55:18,120 --> 01:55:19,588
Of course we can.

2158
01:55:27,879 --> 01:55:30,348
Amy, it's time to move on.

2159
01:55:30,507 --> 01:55:32,225
What can I do to help?

2160
01:55:32,926 --> 01:55:34,348
I need some time to think.

2161
01:55:34,511 --> 01:55:35,763
That's the last thing you need.

2162
01:55:35,846 --> 01:55:36,893
Desi...

2163
01:55:37,055 --> 01:55:39,524
Twenty years, you have
kept me dangling.

2164
01:55:39,683 --> 01:55:43,358
Finally, last night, you came
to me, and you chose me.

2165
01:55:44,062 --> 01:55:45,279
Follow that instinct.

2166
01:55:45,439 --> 01:55:47,862
Don't trust the instinct that
left you beaten and homeless...

2167
01:55:48,400 --> 01:55:51,574
sleeping in your car,
fearing for your life.

2168
01:55:54,906 --> 01:55:57,625
I'm not gonna force
myself on you.

2169
01:56:00,036 --> 01:56:02,710
I understand what
you're saying, Desi.

2170
01:56:03,957 --> 01:56:05,584
I do.

2171
01:56:08,920 --> 01:56:10,922
I've been so mistreated
for so long.

2172
01:56:13,592 --> 01:56:16,471
I've forgotten how to behave.

2173
01:56:22,225 --> 01:56:24,398
I'll move in here tomorrow...

2174
01:56:24,561 --> 01:56:27,155
and we'll work it out together.

2175
01:56:29,232 --> 01:56:32,953
I just want you to be you again.

2176
01:56:40,785 --> 01:56:42,162
<i>They only took
Margo to fuck with you.</i>

2177
01:56:42,329 --> 01:56:43,922
She's not spending another
fucking second in there.

2178
01:56:44,080 --> 01:56:46,833
I'm gonna go in, and I'm
gonna tell them everything.

2179
01:56:47,501 --> 01:56:49,253
What?

2180
01:56:51,254 --> 01:56:52,756
We tell Boney very little.

2181
01:56:52,923 --> 01:56:54,925
Without a body, without
a murder weapon...

2182
01:56:55,091 --> 01:56:57,264
their only hope is a confession.

2183
01:56:57,427 --> 01:56:59,270
So, you let them do
all the talking.

2184
01:56:59,429 --> 01:57:01,431
That way, we can
jump-start your defense.

2185
01:57:01,598 --> 01:57:03,976
The truth is my defense.

2186
01:57:09,898 --> 01:57:10,898
Recognize these?

2187
01:57:10,941 --> 01:57:12,943
Yes. It's Amy's anniversary
present to me.

2188
01:57:13,109 --> 01:57:14,782
Was that how she told you
she was pregnant, Nick?

2189
01:57:14,945 --> 01:57:17,448
Mommy, Daddy, baby, and
that made you real mad?

2190
01:57:17,948 --> 01:57:19,120
No.

2191
01:57:20,367 --> 01:57:22,327
Recognize this? Never seen
that before in my life.

2192
01:57:22,702 --> 01:57:25,956
It's Amy's diary. We found
this at your father's house.

2193
01:57:27,958 --> 01:57:29,238
Is this your wife's handwriting?

2194
01:57:29,292 --> 01:57:31,169
He's not a handwriting ex...
Looks like it.

2195
01:57:31,336 --> 01:57:32,462
Our experts thought so, too.

2196
01:57:33,797 --> 01:57:35,515
Do you wanna play a
little true or false?

2197
01:57:36,258 --> 01:57:37,350
Sure.

2198
01:57:37,509 --> 01:57:41,980
"And then he brushes the sugar
off my lips so he can taste me."

2199
01:57:43,098 --> 01:57:45,100
Yeah, that's true.

2200
01:57:46,351 --> 01:57:48,353
You thought quinoa was a fish?

2201
01:57:49,646 --> 01:57:50,989
That is also true, yes.

2202
01:57:53,149 --> 01:57:55,151
She wanted to get pregnant,
you assaulted her.

2203
01:57:55,318 --> 01:57:57,195
I hit her? No, never happened.

2204
01:57:57,362 --> 01:57:58,864
"Pushed," it says
"pushed." Absolutely not.

2205
01:57:59,030 --> 01:58:00,122
I never touched her.

2206
01:58:02,534 --> 01:58:04,161
She tried to buy a gun.

2207
01:58:04,828 --> 01:58:06,705
I doubt that, but I don't know.

2208
01:58:08,123 --> 01:58:09,625
Shall I read the last entry?

2209
01:58:09,791 --> 01:58:10,838
Sure.

2210
01:58:12,127 --> 01:58:14,129
"This man may kill me."

2211
01:58:14,296 --> 01:58:16,390
In her own words, "This
man may kill me."

2212
01:58:16,548 --> 01:58:18,676
It's kind of a
convenient end note.

2213
01:58:25,181 --> 01:58:26,478
For future reference...

2214
01:58:26,641 --> 01:58:28,860
the truth, you are not
a handwriting expert.

2215
01:58:29,019 --> 01:58:30,066
Okay, I know.

2216
01:58:38,486 --> 01:58:40,329
Judy's missing handle.

2217
01:58:41,865 --> 01:58:44,038
Big as a two-by-four, right?
Big as a club.

2218
01:58:44,200 --> 01:58:46,828
We found this day one, in the
fireplace in your home office.

2219
01:58:46,995 --> 01:58:49,464
We didn't know what the hell
it was, but fire in July?

2220
01:58:49,539 --> 01:58:50,539
We bagged it.

2221
01:58:50,582 --> 01:58:51,583
I've never seen
that before either.

2222
01:58:51,750 --> 01:58:54,253
We just tested it. Fire
doesn't erase blood, Nick.

2223
01:58:54,419 --> 01:58:56,513
So, finally, Nicholas Dunne...

2224
01:58:56,671 --> 01:58:58,173
you're under arrest for
the murder of your wife.

2225
01:58:58,340 --> 01:58:59,432
Do not say another word.

2226
01:58:59,591 --> 01:59:00,934
What about my side? Nick!

2227
01:59:14,272 --> 01:59:15,615
More coffee?

2228
01:59:15,774 --> 01:59:17,572
I'd love it.

2229
01:59:19,861 --> 01:59:23,365
Remember that time we skipped
school and drove to the Cape?

2230
01:59:23,531 --> 01:59:25,954
Oh, God, yeah. Lobster
right from the ocean.

2231
01:59:26,117 --> 01:59:27,744
This reminds me of that.

2232
01:59:28,244 --> 01:59:29,917
Never-ending holiday.

2233
01:59:31,456 --> 01:59:33,550
You're not bored?

2234
01:59:33,708 --> 01:59:35,085
Desi, how could I be bored?

2235
01:59:35,251 --> 01:59:37,595
You can discuss
18th-century symphonies...

2236
01:59:37,754 --> 01:59:40,678
19th-century Impressionists,
quote Proust in French.

2237
01:59:41,049 --> 01:59:45,054
Nick's idea of culture was
a reality TV marathon...

2238
01:59:45,220 --> 01:59:47,097
with one hand down his boxers.

2239
01:59:49,099 --> 01:59:50,692
I really have to get going.

2240
01:59:51,017 --> 01:59:54,362
But I will be back
just as soon as I can.

2241
02:00:00,944 --> 02:00:02,036
My keys.

2242
02:00:07,242 --> 02:00:09,244
Thank you.

2243
02:00:14,999 --> 02:00:16,091
Ow!

2244
02:00:20,463 --> 02:00:22,056
That's how the kids wear it.

2245
02:01:22,859 --> 02:01:26,705
Dunne? You got one
hell of a lawyer.

2246
02:01:29,532 --> 02:01:30,704
Hey-

2247
02:01:31,117 --> 02:01:32,118
Are you okay?

2248
02:01:32,202 --> 02:01:33,374
Yes. Are you?

2249
02:01:33,536 --> 02:01:34,662
Yeah.

2250
02:01:34,829 --> 02:01:36,706
Let's go.

2251
02:01:38,541 --> 02:01:39,633
What does this mean?

2252
02:01:39,793 --> 02:01:41,841
Well, you're out on bond.

2253
02:01:42,003 --> 02:01:45,223
You can relax at home
while we prep for trial.

2254
02:01:50,720 --> 02:01:52,722
Keep your head down.

2255
02:02:08,154 --> 02:02:10,407
Tanner, is there any
fucking lead on Amy?

2256
02:02:10,573 --> 02:02:12,575
I've got two of my
best guys on it.

2257
02:02:13,076 --> 02:02:14,703
She's air.

2258
02:02:16,746 --> 02:02:19,716
Come home, Amy. I dare you.

2259
02:03:16,931 --> 02:03:19,354
Mr. Collings is home.

2260
02:03:19,517 --> 02:03:21,770
Hello, Mr. Collings.

2261
02:03:21,936 --> 02:03:23,688
I've missed you.

2262
02:03:23,855 --> 02:03:25,482
I've been thinking...

2263
02:03:25,940 --> 02:03:28,113
I don't wanna be without you.
Oh.

2264
02:03:28,818 --> 02:03:31,037
Stay with me.

2265
02:03:31,195 --> 02:03:34,039
And when all this dies down, we'll
go to Greece, like you said.

2266
02:03:34,198 --> 02:03:36,496
Octopus and Scrabble?

2267
02:03:38,494 --> 02:03:40,622
How long do you think
until it's done?

2268
02:03:40,788 --> 02:03:44,383
Not long. Six months for the trial.
Sentencing will be quick.

2269
02:03:44,876 --> 02:03:45,923
He'll appeal.

2270
02:03:46,002 --> 02:03:48,130
I can watch the rest overseas.

2271
02:04:05,521 --> 02:04:06,647
Go slowly.

2272
02:04:06,731 --> 02:04:07,732
But I want it.

2273
02:04:27,794 --> 02:04:29,637
Don't rush.

2274
02:04:29,837 --> 02:04:31,931
Just do it.

2275
02:04:40,390 --> 02:04:41,937
Harder.

2276
02:06:20,490 --> 02:06:23,619
You fucking bitch.

2277
02:06:32,335 --> 02:06:36,010
Don't you worry, you're
gonna have lots of babies.

2278
02:06:37,632 --> 02:06:41,011
Her wounds are consistent with rape.
There was semen present.

2279
02:06:41,177 --> 02:06:42,337
We'll make sure it's a match.

2280
02:06:42,345 --> 02:06:43,972
Yeah, it'll match.

2281
02:06:44,138 --> 02:06:46,482
Thank you very much.

2282
02:06:46,641 --> 02:06:48,018
What do you think?

2283
02:06:48,184 --> 02:06:49,356
Are we pals again?

2284
02:06:49,519 --> 02:06:52,864
Now that I know you didn't
murder your wife, yes.

2285
02:06:52,939 --> 02:06:53,940
What do you think?

2286
02:06:54,107 --> 02:06:57,031
Kidnapping? The story's insane.

2287
02:06:59,195 --> 02:07:01,539
She's on fairly
heavy painkillers.

2288
02:07:01,697 --> 02:07:03,495
It's okay. I want to help.

2289
02:07:03,574 --> 02:07:05,121
Ms. Dunne, I know
what you've been through...

2290
02:07:05,201 --> 02:07:07,329
so we'll keep this very brief.

2291
02:07:07,495 --> 02:07:09,873
Can you walk us through
what happened?

2292
02:07:12,500 --> 02:07:15,128
That morning, the doorbell rang.

2293
02:07:16,003 --> 02:07:17,880
So normal.

2294
02:07:18,047 --> 02:07:19,890
I opened the door.

2295
02:07:20,508 --> 02:07:22,351
So strange.

2296
02:07:22,969 --> 02:07:26,473
Since high school, he
won't ever go away.

2297
02:07:26,639 --> 02:07:29,609
And I've just tried
to be nice to him.

2298
02:07:29,767 --> 02:07:31,394
Answer his letters.

2299
02:07:31,644 --> 02:07:33,646
Keep him calm.

2300
02:07:35,064 --> 02:07:36,532
Oh, my God.

2301
02:07:37,150 --> 02:07:38,652
Oh, I've encouraged him.

2302
02:07:38,818 --> 02:07:40,616
You can't blame yourself.

2303
02:07:42,238 --> 02:07:44,411
He pushed inside.

2304
02:07:45,992 --> 02:07:48,040
And he grabbed me.

2305
02:07:48,744 --> 02:07:51,839
But I got away, and
ran to the kitchen.

2306
02:07:52,165 --> 02:07:53,883
And he clubbed me.

2307
02:07:54,333 --> 02:07:55,630
I collapsed.

2308
02:07:55,793 --> 02:07:59,718
That club was actually the handle
to a Punch and Judy puppet.

2309
02:07:59,881 --> 02:08:01,303
Right.

2310
02:08:02,216 --> 02:08:03,638
Treasure hunt.

2311
02:08:05,553 --> 02:08:07,476
I'd hidden some
puppets at Go's...

2312
02:08:07,638 --> 02:08:09,356
Then how did Desi
have that handle?

2313
02:08:11,225 --> 02:08:13,148
I'd just found it.

2314
02:08:13,895 --> 02:08:16,318
It must have fallen off.

2315
02:08:16,439 --> 02:08:17,440
I...

2316
02:08:18,232 --> 02:08:21,782
was holding it when Desi pushed in.
So, he got it from me.

2317
02:08:21,944 --> 02:08:23,036
About that woodshed...

2318
02:08:23,196 --> 02:08:24,869
He took me to his lake house.

2319
02:08:25,448 --> 02:08:27,041
Tied me to his bed.

2320
02:08:27,200 --> 02:08:29,623
Back to the woodshed real quick.
Real quick.

2321
02:08:29,785 --> 02:08:31,503
When you went to place
the puppets there...

2322
02:08:31,662 --> 02:08:33,062
did you notice that
it was packed...

2323
02:08:33,080 --> 02:08:34,127
Lots of stuff.

2324
02:08:34,290 --> 02:08:36,668
Corresponding to
purchases made...

2325
02:08:36,751 --> 02:08:38,594
on credit cards in
your husband's name.

2326
02:08:38,753 --> 02:08:40,130
Nick and credit cards.

2327
02:08:40,296 --> 02:08:42,719
He buys, I nag. I
don't know, probably.

2328
02:08:42,882 --> 02:08:45,681
He hid a lot of stuff at Go's.
They're very close.

2329
02:08:46,219 --> 02:08:50,440
Now, may I go back to where I
was being held prisoner...

2330
02:08:50,598 --> 02:08:53,226
by a man with a history
of mental problems?

2331
02:08:53,392 --> 02:08:54,472
Please continue, Ms. Dunne.

2332
02:08:58,773 --> 02:09:00,867
Desi assaulted me that night.

2333
02:09:01,817 --> 02:09:03,660
Every night.

2334
02:09:04,779 --> 02:09:07,202
He tied me up like a dog.

2335
02:09:08,574 --> 02:09:11,077
And then, he'd punish me.

2336
02:09:12,995 --> 02:09:15,043
Starve me.

2337
02:09:16,332 --> 02:09:18,255
Shave me.

2338
02:09:19,877 --> 02:09:21,845
Sodomize me.

2339
02:09:22,630 --> 02:09:24,348
There were cameras everywhere.

2340
02:09:24,507 --> 02:09:27,477
Please find this.
Please find the tapes.

2341
02:09:29,136 --> 02:09:32,356
She slit his throat
with a box cutter.

2342
02:09:33,432 --> 02:09:35,526
How did she manage to get
a hold of a box cutter...

2343
02:09:35,685 --> 02:09:38,279
if he had her tied
up the whole time?

2344
02:09:39,230 --> 02:09:41,278
Can't you just be happy
your wife is home and safe?

2345
02:09:42,066 --> 02:09:43,909
Amy, we found your diary.

2346
02:09:44,068 --> 02:09:48,039
It contains many concerning allegations
of mental and physical abuse.

2347
02:09:48,197 --> 02:09:51,076
Well, it's the ugly truth.

2348
02:09:51,909 --> 02:09:53,411
Nick didn't want a baby.

2349
02:09:55,246 --> 02:09:58,546
He has a temper. We
had money problems.

2350
02:09:59,458 --> 02:10:00,459
But I love him.

2351
02:10:00,626 --> 02:10:02,378
Then why did you
try to buy a gun?

2352
02:10:04,338 --> 02:10:06,306
I'm sorry, I feel myself fading.

2353
02:10:06,465 --> 02:10:08,183
If I could just
clarify one thing...

2354
02:10:08,342 --> 02:10:11,437
If this case had been left in
your deeply incompetent hands...

2355
02:10:11,595 --> 02:10:13,472
my husband would
be on death row...

2356
02:10:13,764 --> 02:10:17,519
and I'd be tied,
still, spread-eagle...

2357
02:10:17,810 --> 02:10:21,485
Ms. Dunne, you've been very brave.
We're finished.

2358
02:10:22,356 --> 02:10:24,404
Now, I have to ask you...

2359
02:10:24,567 --> 02:10:27,411
do you feel safe going
home with your husband?

2360
02:10:39,832 --> 02:10:42,335
We prayed to God, and God
has answered our prayers.

2361
02:10:42,501 --> 02:10:43,753
Amy Dunne is home.

2362
02:10:43,919 --> 02:10:45,887
Now, I know there are a lot
of questions and concerns...

2363
02:10:46,047 --> 02:10:47,924
but for right now, we
wanna sit tight...

2364
02:10:48,090 --> 02:10:49,808
and just be thankful
and grateful...

2365
02:10:49,884 --> 02:10:53,013
for this miracle on
the Mississippi.

2366
02:11:00,478 --> 02:11:02,276
Excuse me. Excuse us, folks.

2367
02:11:54,031 --> 02:11:55,248
We love you, Amy!

2368
02:11:59,870 --> 02:12:01,588
All right, you can
stop pretending now.

2369
02:12:01,747 --> 02:12:03,420
I'm not pretending.

2370
02:12:04,125 --> 02:12:05,843
You were perfect.

2371
02:12:06,460 --> 02:12:08,883
The Nick I saw on TV, that's
the Nick I fell in love with.

2372
02:12:09,046 --> 02:12:10,263
You do know I was
just telling you...

2373
02:12:10,339 --> 02:12:11,636
what you wanted to hear, right?

2374
02:12:11,799 --> 02:12:13,517
That's how well you know me.

2375
02:12:13,676 --> 02:12:16,304
You know me in your marrow.

2376
02:12:17,304 --> 02:12:18,772
Okay-

2377
02:12:18,931 --> 02:12:22,276
You need to tell me
exactly what happened.

2378
02:12:23,561 --> 02:12:24,813
Take off your clothes.

2379
02:12:25,312 --> 02:12:28,532
I need to make sure you're
not wearing a wire.

2380
02:12:41,829 --> 02:12:45,709
You killed someone, Amy.
You're a murderer.

2381
02:12:45,875 --> 02:12:47,343
I'm a fighter.

2382
02:12:47,501 --> 02:12:49,845
I fought my way back to you.

2383
02:12:50,004 --> 02:12:51,677
You killed a guy.

2384
02:12:51,881 --> 02:12:53,724
You slashed his throat
with a box cutter.

2385
02:12:53,883 --> 02:12:56,477
You went on national
television...

2386
02:12:56,552 --> 02:12:58,554
and begged for me
to save your life.

2387
02:12:59,138 --> 02:13:00,264
And I obliged.

2388
02:13:00,431 --> 02:13:01,899
But I want that Nick.

2389
02:13:02,224 --> 02:13:03,521
I'm leaving.

2390
02:13:03,684 --> 02:13:06,312
You really think that's smart?

2391
02:13:06,896 --> 02:13:07,943
Shampoo.

2392
02:13:10,691 --> 02:13:14,491
Wounded, raped wife battles her
way back to her husband...

2393
02:13:14,653 --> 02:13:16,405
and he deserts her.

2394
02:13:16,572 --> 02:13:17,619
They'll destroy you.

2395
02:13:18,365 --> 02:13:19,742
Neighbors will shun you.

2396
02:13:19,909 --> 02:13:24,130
And I'll make sure that no one
forgets the pain you caused me.

2397
02:13:26,207 --> 02:13:31,304
I don't want anything to do
with your groupies outside.

2398
02:13:31,879 --> 02:13:33,506
Once they go...

2399
02:13:34,173 --> 02:13:35,174
I go.

2400
02:13:35,341 --> 02:13:38,766
Give it the night. Sleep on it.

2401
02:13:55,611 --> 02:13:57,204
Was there ever a baby?

2402
02:13:57,488 --> 02:13:59,582
There can be.

2403
02:14:03,577 --> 02:14:04,578
Good night.

2404
02:14:57,673 --> 02:14:59,346
Hey, Nick!

2405
02:15:11,312 --> 02:15:12,564
Hello, handsome.

2406
02:15:15,691 --> 02:15:17,443
Crepe?

2407
02:15:18,027 --> 02:15:19,028
Sure.

2408
02:15:19,111 --> 02:15:20,704
<i><i>She
was his dream girl.</i>

2409
02:15:20,863 --> 02:15:24,163
<i>And when this spoiled, rich, entitled
little boy couldn't have her...</i>

2410
02:15:24,325 --> 02:15:25,702
<i>he took her.</i>

2411
02:15:33,083 --> 02:15:34,426
You must be so proud.

2412
02:15:41,675 --> 02:15:43,677
It's been four hours.

2413
02:15:44,178 --> 02:15:47,022
Nick? Nick? What's
next for you and Amy?

2414
02:15:51,185 --> 02:15:54,029
Right now, it's all
about our marriage.

2415
02:15:54,855 --> 02:15:58,234
When two people love each other
and can't make that work...

2416
02:15:58,400 --> 02:16:00,823
that's the real tragedy.

2417
02:16:04,573 --> 02:16:06,621
Kiss my cheek.

2418
02:16:12,956 --> 02:16:15,356
I can't believe that fucking
spider is America's sweetheart.

2419
02:16:15,793 --> 02:16:17,887
She told me she killed Desi.

2420
02:16:18,045 --> 02:16:19,262
Not self-defense. Murder.

2421
02:16:19,421 --> 02:16:20,843
- Can't we get a wire?
- That's not gonna work.

2422
02:16:21,006 --> 02:16:22,053
She told you once before.

2423
02:16:22,216 --> 02:16:24,435
Yeah, because she had me strip
naked, and stand in the shower.

2424
02:16:24,593 --> 02:16:27,722
I swear, you two are the most
fucked-up people I've ever known.

2425
02:16:27,888 --> 02:16:29,356
And I specialize in fucked-up.

2426
02:16:29,598 --> 02:16:31,316
You and Amy under the same roof?

2427
02:16:31,475 --> 02:16:33,273
You should pitch that
as reality television.

2428
02:16:33,894 --> 02:16:36,147
<i>Amy Dunne, and
the Miracle on the Mississippi.</i>

2429
02:16:36,313 --> 02:16:38,691
<i>Nick and I have been
through some bad patches.</i>

2430
02:16:38,857 --> 02:16:40,074
<i>We've had our dark days.</i>

2431
02:16:40,234 --> 02:16:42,077
<i>But we thank you so much...</i>

2432
02:16:42,569 --> 02:16:47,120
<i>for supporting us in our new life
together, for forgiving Nick.</i>

2433
02:16:47,366 --> 02:16:50,961
<i>Really, your encouragement
means the world.</i>

2434
02:16:51,120 --> 02:16:52,417
Oh, she's good.

2435
02:16:52,579 --> 02:16:55,048
<i>Amazing Amy and the
Humbled Husband.</i>

2436
02:16:55,207 --> 02:16:57,175
<i>The Real Housewives of Branson.</i>

2437
02:16:57,334 --> 02:16:58,381
Take care of this guy, will you?

2438
02:16:58,460 --> 02:17:00,020
I can't believe you're
just leaving now.

2439
02:17:00,087 --> 02:17:01,509
You are not at risk anymore.

2440
02:17:01,672 --> 02:17:03,049
I'm the definition of "at risk."

2441
02:17:03,257 --> 02:17:07,262
You got a book deal, a Lifetime
movie, you franchised The Bar.

2442
02:17:07,428 --> 02:17:08,475
You may wanna thank her.

2443
02:17:11,515 --> 02:17:12,937
Just don't piss her off.

2444
02:17:13,517 --> 02:17:14,518
See you, guys-

2445
02:17:16,895 --> 02:17:18,442
Elvis has left Missouri.

2446
02:17:18,522 --> 02:17:19,722
She had to have made a mistake.

2447
02:17:19,732 --> 02:17:21,905
We need to check Amy's
story, piece by piece.

2448
02:17:22,067 --> 02:17:23,944
Nick, I can't do anything.

2449
02:17:24,361 --> 02:17:27,080
We had the national spotlight
on us, we stained the rug.

2450
02:17:27,239 --> 02:17:28,959
The case is with the
Feds now, they're done.

2451
02:17:28,991 --> 02:17:30,038
That doesn't mean you
have to be done.

2452
02:17:30,451 --> 02:17:32,249
It does.

2453
02:18:03,817 --> 02:18:05,285
What are you doing?

2454
02:18:07,196 --> 02:18:08,664
Couldn't sleep.

2455
02:18:08,822 --> 02:18:09,823
Come on...

2456
02:18:10,115 --> 02:18:12,288
let me tuck you back in.

2457
02:18:24,963 --> 02:18:27,591
You know you can sleep
with me, right?

2458
02:18:29,676 --> 02:18:31,644
Yeah, it's just...

2459
02:18:31,804 --> 02:18:33,147
I need more time.

2460
02:18:33,347 --> 02:18:36,897
I would never, ever hurt you.

2461
02:18:38,685 --> 02:18:41,029
I do need you to
participate, though.

2462
02:18:41,188 --> 02:18:43,361
I need you to do your part.

2463
02:18:53,659 --> 02:18:54,660
Okay.

2464
02:18:55,661 --> 02:18:58,130
Everything you have
heard about my wife...

2465
02:18:58,288 --> 02:18:59,540
is a lie.

2466
02:18:59,706 --> 02:19:03,802
She is a calculating,
murderous psychopath.

2467
02:19:04,419 --> 02:19:05,841
And I have been complicit...

2468
02:19:06,004 --> 02:19:07,130
Nick!

2469
02:19:12,803 --> 02:19:14,805
Nick? Breakfast.

2470
02:19:14,888 --> 02:19:15,889
Honey?

2471
02:19:19,560 --> 02:19:21,904
We should hold hands.

2472
02:19:22,062 --> 02:19:25,157
Not the entire time, but
on and off throughout.

2473
02:19:26,567 --> 02:19:28,786
"So, Nick, how does it feel
to have your wife back?"

2474
02:19:31,405 --> 02:19:33,157
"lt's fantastic.

2475
02:19:33,323 --> 02:19:34,723
"How many people are
lucky enough...

2476
02:19:34,783 --> 02:19:36,251
"to get a second
chance at love?"

2477
02:19:36,410 --> 02:19:38,128
"Fantastic" is a
little flippant.

2478
02:19:38,537 --> 02:19:39,538
"Amazing"?

2479
02:19:39,705 --> 02:19:42,424
I need you to admit that you
got the credit cards...

2480
02:19:42,583 --> 02:19:45,587
and that you hid all that stuff
at Go's and that you pushed me.

2481
02:19:46,336 --> 02:19:49,385
I'm gonna need those three
things to feel safe.

2482
02:19:50,591 --> 02:19:52,434
You have to own this, Nick.

2483
02:19:53,218 --> 02:19:54,720
Don't worry.

2484
02:19:54,803 --> 02:19:56,771
I know exactly what to say.

2485
02:19:58,348 --> 02:20:00,100
Nick.

2486
02:20:03,061 --> 02:20:05,689
What a beautiful home.

2487
02:20:06,940 --> 02:20:09,489
I so appreciate you giving
us this time, Nick.

2488
02:20:09,651 --> 02:20:11,699
You went on national
television...

2489
02:20:11,862 --> 02:20:14,206
and told people that
I murdered my wife.

2490
02:20:14,364 --> 02:20:15,490
I go where the story goes.

2491
02:20:15,657 --> 02:20:18,501
You implied that I had carnal
relations with my sister.

2492
02:20:18,660 --> 02:20:22,085
I didn't use the "I" word. I said
you two were "extremely close."

2493
02:20:22,247 --> 02:20:26,923
You and a panel of nitwits
diagnosed me as a sociopath.

2494
02:20:28,128 --> 02:20:29,880
Ice-breaker.

2495
02:20:33,592 --> 02:20:35,265
To go with your robot dog.

2496
02:20:35,427 --> 02:20:37,475
I'll go find Amy.

2497
02:20:39,514 --> 02:20:41,608
She's downstairs.

2498
02:20:44,102 --> 02:20:45,604
What is it? It's for you.

2499
02:20:45,771 --> 02:20:47,193
Open it.

2500
02:20:47,481 --> 02:20:49,108
I don't need any
more gifts from you.

2501
02:20:49,274 --> 02:20:50,992
Open it.

2502
02:21:03,538 --> 02:21:05,085
I didn't touch you.

2503
02:21:05,248 --> 02:21:06,249
You didn't need to.

2504
02:21:06,333 --> 02:21:09,428
Bullshit. That
notice of disposal.

2505
02:21:09,586 --> 02:21:10,963
I have that. You threw it out.

2506
02:21:11,129 --> 02:21:12,972
The notice, yes.

2507
02:21:13,215 --> 02:21:14,216
I want a blood test.

2508
02:21:14,758 --> 02:21:15,850
I want a paternity test.

2509
02:21:16,635 --> 02:21:17,852
I love tests.

2510
02:21:18,011 --> 02:21:19,729
You can teach those people
to hate me all you want.

2511
02:21:19,888 --> 02:21:22,607
I don't care. I am leaving you.

2512
02:21:24,726 --> 02:21:27,320
I won't have to teach
your child to hate you.

2513
02:21:27,479 --> 02:21:29,732
He'll do that all by himself.

2514
02:21:29,898 --> 02:21:31,775
You fucking cunt!

2515
02:21:33,652 --> 02:21:35,905
I'm the cunt you married.

2516
02:21:36,071 --> 02:21:37,744
The only time you
liked yourself...

2517
02:21:37,906 --> 02:21:41,456
was when you were trying to be
someone this cunt might like.

2518
02:21:41,618 --> 02:21:45,088
I'm not a quitter.
I'm that cunt.

2519
02:21:48,834 --> 02:21:52,088
I've killed for you.
Who else can say that?

2520
02:21:53,338 --> 02:21:55,761
You think you would be happy
with a nice Midwestern girl?

2521
02:21:55,924 --> 02:21:58,643
No way, baby. I'm it.

2522
02:21:58,802 --> 02:22:02,102
Look, you're delusional.
You're insane.

2523
02:22:02,264 --> 02:22:03,766
Why would you even want this?

2524
02:22:04,141 --> 02:22:05,188
Yes, I loved you.

2525
02:22:05,267 --> 02:22:08,612
And then all we did was resent each
other, and try to control each other.

2526
02:22:08,770 --> 02:22:09,810
And cause each other pain.

2527
02:22:10,313 --> 02:22:12,111
That's marriage.

2528
02:22:14,776 --> 02:22:17,154
Now, I'm getting ready.

2529
02:22:42,471 --> 02:22:45,441
<i>I can't watch you play house with
that thing for the next 18 years.</i>

2530
02:22:45,599 --> 02:22:47,146
I can't just walk away.

2531
02:22:47,309 --> 02:22:48,777
You could get custody.

2532
02:22:48,935 --> 02:22:52,690
No, I won't. And you know it.

2533
02:22:52,856 --> 02:22:55,359
It's gonna be my child.
I'm not gonna leave it.

2534
02:22:55,984 --> 02:22:57,657
You wanna stay.

2535
02:22:57,819 --> 02:23:01,619
I have a responsibility. It's
not about what I want anymore.

2536
02:23:01,782 --> 02:23:03,034
You wanna stay with her.

2537
02:23:13,668 --> 02:23:14,715
You're breaking my heart.

2538
02:23:15,170 --> 02:23:18,674
Go, you're my voice of reason.

2539
02:23:18,840 --> 02:23:21,218
I need you with me on this.

2540
02:23:21,384 --> 02:23:23,853
Of course I'm with you.

2541
02:23:26,473 --> 02:23:30,478
I was with you before
we were even born.

2542
02:23:32,229 --> 02:23:35,028
We've been
through the darkness.

2543
02:23:35,565 --> 02:23:38,865
We've come out, united.

2544
02:23:41,863 --> 02:23:44,036
We communicate.

2545
02:23:46,326 --> 02:23:48,704
We're honest with each other.

2546
02:23:48,870 --> 02:23:50,372
Right?

2547
02:23:52,290 --> 02:23:54,793
We're partners in crime.

2548
02:23:58,004 --> 02:23:59,005
And?

2549
02:24:00,882 --> 02:24:02,225
And?

2550
02:24:05,720 --> 02:24:07,643
We're gonna be parents.

2551
02:24:08,223 --> 02:24:10,976
Oh, my goodness!

2552
02:24:11,393 --> 02:24:13,361
