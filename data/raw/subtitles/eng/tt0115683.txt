Whoa, whoa, whoa!

162
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,876
Ow! Oww!

163
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,150
- Exhale, Stubbs.
- I kill you.

164
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,840
Whoa! A little demonite...

165
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:56,553
Exhale, Stubbs. Go!
Sorry about this.

166
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:59,797
Please, I would like to introduce my team:

167
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,311
- Miss Olivia Biggs, our geologist.
- <i>(applause)</i>

168
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,671
Mr TC Romulus, our entomologist.

169
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,837
Miss Petra Von Kant, our oceanographer.

170
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:14,794
And Miss Mimi Simkins,
our agriculturalist.

171
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,559
I can't do it here.
Tiny Elvis has stage fright.

172
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:22,390
Just think of the water. Just...
Come on, just let it go. Hurry.

173
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,476
I can't do it here.

174
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,390
Hey, come on. Give me your smoke.

175
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:35,789
With the cutting of this ribbon, a new era
in science and technology begins.

176
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,275
- What are you doing?
- Watch.

177
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:48,479
Over there on the grassy knoll!
Assassins! Assassins!

178
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,752
- Holy Kennedy!
- A little secret...

179
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,511
Section two, code three. 10-4.

180
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,830
- What kind of mall is this?
- There's no stores, or food courts,

181
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,110
or toiletries.

182
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,710
There's gotta be a toiletry
around here somewhere.

183
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:18,119
Now look at all the vegetation
for your fertilisation.

184
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,916
Well, it seems as if someone
was a little eager to celebrate!

185
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,157
God bless you. I know how you feel.

186
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:30,193
I've been waiting for this moment
for a long time.

187
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,719
Give me the scissors.

188
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,719
Ohh... Ohh... Ohh...

189
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,115
Ohh... Ohhhhh!

Good luck!

195
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,917
- Are you OK?
- Mm. Pulled a nad.

196
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,270
Let's get out of this Jurassic Mall,

197
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:18,075
find the girls, and take care of
what we need to take care of.

<i>(Faulkner)</i> Here we go. Here we go.

207
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:02,518
Mr Leaky, has there been some kind
of security breach? Who are these men?

208
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:06,394
Has the Bio-Dome been contaminated?

209
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:11,674
No, no.
Ladies and gentlemen, surprise, surprise.

210
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:17,352
We are pleased to announce the arrival
of our two special scientists.

211
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,916
- Beam me up, Stubby.
- Jim! He's a Vulcan!

212
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,316
This pre-planned addition
to Team Bio-Dome

213
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:30,436
is intended to simulate the Chaos Theory
as we encounter it in nature.

214
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,991
We'll have plenty more information on this
a little later on and I'll get back to you,

215
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:40,272
but as you see,
right now we have work to do.

216
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,356
Work to do!

217
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:52,829
Who could be stupid enough
to think Bio-Dome was a mall?

218
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,394
Bud Maclntosh and Doyle Johnson.

219
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:58,432
Generation-X road kill
on the superhighway of progress.

220
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,791
They're not terrorists,
they're college students from Tucson.

221
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,798
They really did think it was a mall.

222
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:08,993
- Get them out now!
- The doors are sealed for one year.

223
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:13,830
I can't open the doors. If I do, the integrity
of all the scientific data is compromised.

224
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:17,396
Everything depends
on the precise time frame of one year!

225
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,717
Screw the time frame!
I have $100 million invested in this,

226
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:25,356
and I don't intend to lose it
because two twits from Tucson

227
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,950
can't tell a mall toilet
from a damned rain forest!

228

<i>(whíspers)</i> Squirl, break the ice.

229
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:42,270
- Excuse me, Miss. Are you tired?
- I beg your pardon.

230
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,789
- Are you tired?
- No. Why?

231

232
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,391
Excuse me, Miss.

233
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:57,070
If you were a yoghurt, would you be
fruit at the bottom, or stirred?

234
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,953
This is <i>your</i> problem. Fix it.

235
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,793
- Then they have to stay.
- All our preparation was for five people.

236
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,434
Adding two more
will throw the system off balance.

237
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:11,757
Then the system... will adapt.

238
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,148
- Did it hurt?
- Did what hurt?

239
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,589
When you fell from heaven, did it hurt?

240
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,279
Bud! Doyle! Hello!

241
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,678
I'm Dr Noah Faulkner. You may recognise
me from my Bio-Dome films on television.

242
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,473
Are you the guy with the spray-on hair?

243
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,195
Anyway, as I'm sure you already know,

244
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:39,074
you have stumbled
into an exciting new world.

245
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,715
Tell me, have you ever
dreamt of being famous?

246
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:48,119
When I was a kid I wanted to be a rock
star cos I could do this with my finger.

247
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,358
But as I got older I realised
that the corporate rock world sucked.

248
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,471
And besides, you only knew one song.

249
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,990
<i>♪ Iron Man, Iron Man,</i>
does whatever an iron can

250

- <i>♪ Pancake-flat, like a glove...</i>
- Hold it!

251
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:05,634
That's "Spider-Man".
Black Sabbath did "Iron Man".

What, do you think you're so... smart?

253

you're some rocket scientist?

254
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,555
- Yes.
- Sorry.

255
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,076
What do you boys want out of life?

256
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,839
To die and come back as a leotard.

257
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,597
Well...

258
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:27,475
I may be able to offer you
a springboard to that future.

259
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:32,957
- We would like you to stay with us.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute, man.

260
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:36,038
You guys aren't one of those
freaky clans, are you?

261
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,913
Dancing naked, you want us
to take off our clothes,

262
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,679
- and feed us some weird punch?
- No.

263
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:46,555
Damn! We almost had it.
It was this close.

264
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:52,436
Boys, this is where you'll be staying,
and I want you to feel right at home.

267
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,469

the big tourists lie in for free.

00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:48,076
You should be brought up to speed.
It is time for a tour.

301
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:54,429
Boys. Boys! From here you can see
all the regions of the Bio-Dome:

302
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:59,350
The rain forest, the tropical lagoon,
the farm, and the great desert.

303
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:02,631
Every effort was made
to duplicate them precisely,

304
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:05,194
and all of this is your home now.

305
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:13,598
But remember, the survival of this system
is dependent upon homeostasis.

306
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:18,475
That means a balance
within an enclosed system itself.

00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,836

00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:30,870
Remember, at Bio-Dome we're dependent
on balancing homos within the system.

325
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,676
OK. Now, everybody stay with the group.
Follow me. This way.

326
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:40,513
- Jerk! You shouldn't have hit me so hard.
- <i>(Bud laughs)</i>

327
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,518
<i>(whíspers)</i> No, wait.
Come here, come here.

328
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:48,668
- Hey! There's no knob here!
- <i>(Olívía)</i> Oh, God. Here we go.

329
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,758
Olivia, what's with this door?
It's not opening.

330
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:54,997
Of course it won't open.
It won't open again for an entire year.

331
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,032
Nothing comes in, nothing goes out.
Not even air.

332
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:01,311
It would take a Sherman tank
to open that door.

333
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,592
- Hmm... So what you're saying is...
- You can't get out.

334
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,790
- We're stuck here.
- For 12 months.

335
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,150
- That's right.
- 12 months?

336
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,191
- 52 weeks.
- Yes!

337
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,629
Three hundred and eighty-five days?!

338
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,512
Yes. Yes. Yes!

339
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:21,395
So what you're <i>really</i> trying to say is?

340
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,116
<i>(growls)</i>

341
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,595
Stubby Squirly tribal!

342
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,837
I'm a Sherman tank!

343
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,315
Sherman tank!

344
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,590
<i>♪ Doyle, Doyle, Doyle of the jungle</i>

00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:42,075
<i>♪ Friend to you and me</i>

Where'd you go?

349
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:57,115
Where did <i>you</i> come from?

350
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:02,831
My mom and the authorities are still
trying to figure that out, but hey.

351
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,032
- D'you know there's a jungle in here?
- Yes, I do.

352
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:11,518
Well, whoever thought of putting a jungle
in Arizona is a pretty smart guy.

353
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,200
Woah! Barbarella!

354
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:28,197
- What are you doin', making smoothies?
- No.

355
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,198
Nature is about miracles, Bud.

356
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,390
A goat is a miracle.

357
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,230
A carrot is a miracle.

358
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,235
And you're a miracle too, Petri.

359
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,310
What's up, Doc?

360
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,590
Why are you putting him
in the rice paddy?

361
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,599
Tilapia are an integral part
of our food supply.

362
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:59,669
- They eat the algae then fertilise the rice.
- So then these... tipatilia,

363
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,155
they're goin' unh-unh on the rice?

364
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,077
"Unh-unh"?

365
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:08,239
- I mean crappin' on the rice.
- Well, in crude layman's terms, yes.

366
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,037
Does Uncle Ben know about this?

367
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,435
So, um... Hey, I know yoga. Look.

368
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:23,278
Do it like that. And sometimes
I can lick my back, too. Watch.

369
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,277
Petra!

370
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,675
The tide monitor needs attention.

371
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,916
When I really stretch, I can...

372
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:33,555
- <i>(Faulkner)</i> Thank you.
- Hey, wait! Don't go anywhere.

373
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:36,956
Maybe I'll show you
some other manoeuvres later.

374
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:40,311
- Ow! God, my sciatic.
- Squirly, Squirly! You gotta come quick.

375
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,396
You gotta come see this.

376
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:45,273
- Your sciatic? It's bad?
- Hit it!

377
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,838
Ohh! You should have seen
what she did with a carrot!

378
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,912
Russell, there's beer cans in the trash in
the kitchen, in the trash in the bathroom,

379
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,996
and in the trash in the basement.

380
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:01,396
- What does that say?
- We're out of beer?

381
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,909
Mom, please tell your love slave

382
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:07,476
that if he's not part of the solution,
he's part of the problem.

383
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,558
The only problem I have
is that I've run out of Depends.

384
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:13,592
Russell, there is a bathroom
right around the corner.

385
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:18,555
I cannot go to the bathroom.
I hurt my bladder rollerblading.

386
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:27,593
Hey, look at that. There's that guy Bob
I chased out of here the other day.

387
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,915
Bud?!

388
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:33,350
- <i>(phone)</i>
- <i>(TV) Earth Day to Earth Day.</i>

389
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:37,029
- <i>That's a long tíme to be locked away...</i>
- They're on TV! <i>(screams)</i>

390
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:40,550
- <i>Can you belíeve ít?!</i>
- <i>... thís ís Joachím West reportíng.</i>

391
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,559
I told you we were into nurturing
Mother Earth, but you didn't believe us.

392
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:51,357
Now you guys are thinking locally,
and we're acting globally!

393
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,277
- Just get out of there.
- We can't.

394
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,630
We signed up. We're part of the few.

395
00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:00,276
- Part of the problem!
- It's an important biological experiment.

396
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:03,392
- You'll ruin everything.
- Maybe you're not aware of it,

397
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,909
but we're a vital part of the homeosystem.

398
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:09,874
Don't you think your couch
is having withdrawals?

399
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,231
So what are we supposed to do?
Wait a year for you guys to get out?

400
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:18,388
Mo-Mo and Porkchop, there comes
a time in life when we must sacrifice

401
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:22,593
what is most dear to us
for the greater good of saving the world,

402
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,915
and now is that time.

403
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:28,874
- Is that how you really feel?
- No. This is how I really feel.

404
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,560
Budly! There's people around.

405
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,432
I know. I miss you.

406
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,278
I'm proud of you.

407
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,675
So I guess this is goodbye.

408
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,236
I guess.

409
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,675
<i>(computer) Attentíon. Dínner ís served.</i>

410
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:58,198
Well... We gotta go. Bye.

411
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,516
Bye.

412
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,870
Day one in the books.

413
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,630
Cheers, mate.

414
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:30,279
- What's with this Kibble?
- Are you guys trying to poison us?

415
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:34,270
- You don't like soy casserole?
- It tastes like it came out of Romulus.

416
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,072
Maybe it did.

417
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:40,159
Soy is our principal source of protein.
You'll learn to love it.

418
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:45,673
Could you at least make it <i>taste</i>
like chicken? A bouillon base, paprika...

419
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:50,271
Spice it up a little? Otherwise
I'm gonna shrivel up like a supermodel.

420
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:53,472
- I am <i>so</i> fat!
- No, you're not.

421
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,114
- Nobody likes me.
- You're beautiful.

422
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,949
- People didn't like me in high school.
- Everybody loves you.

423
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:03,629
Oh, thank you! You're so sweet, Naomi.

424
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,558
<i>Avez-vous une cígarette?</i>

425
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,354
Squirly, are you asleep, man?

426
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,676
Squirl!

427
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,996
Are you sleepin'?

428
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:27,317
- What'd you have to hit me for?
- I can't sleep.

429
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,873
Oh...

430
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,515
Hey, just think back
to those sleepovers we used to have.

431
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,552
If you think back,
then maybe you'll be able to sleep.

432
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,636
- OK.
- OK.

433
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:43,512
<i>(Bud howls)</i> What's up, buddy?
Cos I'm the weasel.

434
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,391
OK, my turn.

435
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,476

Peanut butter and jelly with bacon.
That's easy.

00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:06,395
Good call, man! Keep on cruisin'.
Keep on goin'.

439
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,750
Keep on goin' down the line.

440
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:15,069
Mixed green salad with 1000...
blue cheese dressing.

441
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:19,876
Rad, dude! That was fully major.
Your beaker always knows, buddy.

442
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,755
Keep on cruisin'. Come on, buddy.
It's OK. Keep on cruisin'.

443
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,916
Wait. It's over here now.

444
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:40,118
Yo, Mone. Check it out. Your friends
Bob and Darryl are gettin' tail.

445
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,639
- Assholes!
- If I were you, Mone,

446
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:51,151
I'd go out and hump for the next year.

447
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,510
If I were you, Russ,

448
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:56,871
I'd have my mouth full of shotgun
with my toe on the trigger.

449
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,834
It's frightening how much you want me.

450
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,720
Stubby! "Thriving on Chaos"!

451
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:12,154
Those'll sell better
than Iron Maiden merch.

452
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:16,790
Let's hope so. I just want
you gentlemen to remember

453
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:20,754
how important you are
to this whole experiment.

454
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:26,238
Feel free to contribute. You are
an integral part of the Bio-Dome system.

455
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,510
Um... Since you put it that way,

456
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,996
we were thinking of you producing
maybe environmental condoms,

457
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:36,796
so when you... rip the packet,
it's automatic sap lubrication.

458
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:42,153
No chalk on the bark. And then
when you're pollinating your flower...

459
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:45,750
Slide, slide, slipperty-slide. Just smooth.

460
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:49,190
- Right in.
- And the Bud and Doyle action figures.

461
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:53,518
- Action figures.
- Anatomically correct, of course.

462
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:04,033
And last but not least,
1-900-SQUIRLY-STUB.

463
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,673
Watch this.

464
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:13,431
- <i>(husky)</i> Hi, I'm Doyle.
- And I'm Bud.

465
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:16,552
And when we're not out
saving the environment,

466
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:21,549
we're thinking of you, naked,
thigh-deep in tofu.

467
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,870
You likey, Leaky?

468
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:34,434
<i>(Bud)</i> Our home is the Garden of Eden!

469
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:38,309
More like the Garden of Boredom,
and I'm chairman of the bored.

470
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,954
Come on, Stub. We can have our own fun.

471
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:44,117
Remember the time the Magnavox
went out? What did we do?

472
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:52,317
Fly, Mary Poppins!
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!

473
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,590
Can we do it again, Squirly?

474
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:57,871
- Those were the days.
- Cheer up, buckaroo.

475
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,549
Just cos we're stuck in a bubble
doesn't mean we can't cause any trouble.

476
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,910
We're the everlasting force

477
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:07,919
of Squirly!

478
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,519
Stubby!

479
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,154
You ready? Hut one, hut two,
hut, hut, hike!

480
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,153
- Let me through!
- No!

481
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,714
- Come on, let me through.
- No!

482
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,038
- Neon Deion!
- No fair!

483
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:33,390
- No fair! Personal foul!
- You want some of me?

484
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:37,513
I told you
you shouldn't have had some of me.

485
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,790
Squirly!

486
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,796
Fish on the play!

487
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:46,632
My proposal is that we plant these seeds.

488
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:50,275
And I know you're thinkin'
"Illegal! Illegal!"

489
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:55,474
But the value of purple sticky punge
goes way beyond just tokin' it.

490
00:35:55,600 --> 00:36:02,711
- Ain't that right, Professor Johnson?
- That's correct, Professor Maclntosh.

491
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:08,709
"Purple sticky punge, or hemp,
is an excellent source of paper."

492
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,751
"It makes a fine rope."

493
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,395
"It can even make
a contaminant-free fuel."

494
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:21,676
"But the greatest value to us Bio-Domers
is its rapid rate of photosyninthesis,

495
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:25,588
which means more oxygen for everyone."

496
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:30,029
<i>(both)</i> On three... Three!

497
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,316
Cannonball!

498
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,916
- There you go, Mr Bloom.
- Thanks, girls.

499
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,952
Tell Bud and Doyle
I'm writin' a song about them, OK?

500
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,150
Cool!

501
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,952
- Mone!
- <i>(Jen)</i> Oh, God.

502
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,117
Check it out. This is <i>the</i> event
you've been waiting for.

503
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:09,394
The Annual at Arizona Tech, a three-day
blowout to benefit the rain forest.

504
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:14,548
There's gonna be, like, seminars
and lectures, and kegs and dudes galore.

505
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:17,319
- Monique, we cannot go to this.
- Why not, pray tell?

506
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:21,228
- Do the names Bud and Doyle ring a bell?
- A year's a long time to wait.

507
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:24,318
- Do you know how old we'll be in a year?
- Old.

508
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:27,238
- Real old.
- As in not spring chickens, over the hill...

509
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,679
OK, OK, OK!

510
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:32,270
Plus, did you see the pictures
of the chicks they're in there with?

511
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:36,188
- They're hot.
- So? I trust Doyle.

512
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,959
Listen, I love Bud
just as much as you love Doyle.

513
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:43,358
But we gotta start thinking
about ourselves. They are.

514
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,878
Oh... OK.

515
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:54,074
- Now, pay attention, Soave Bolla.
- You're king, I'm peasant.

516
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,710
Good afternoon, Petri dish.

517
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,949
May-may.

518
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:08,834
Perhaps you'd like to join us
for a little apéritif on the ridge.

519
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:13,033
Allow me to present...
Chateau Squirly Stub.

520
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:16,675
It's a bit plucky, a bit fruity perhaps,

521
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:20,110
but it'll satisfy your palate,
especially with a big piece of pork.

522
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,708
So that's what happened
to our fruit harvest?

523
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,990
You're incorrigible.

524
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,671
- I think they're into us.
- In a huge way.

525
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,756
Mini tribal.

526
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,356
- Marco!
- Cholo!

527
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:39,116
- Marco!
- Cholo!

528
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:42,873
Look. Biodegradable pineapple.

529
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:47,635
Olivia, Romuli. Why don't you guys
join us for a little soak?

530
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:51,389
That's not for bathing.
This is the artificial rain generator.

531
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:57,030
- <i>(farts)</i>
- Whoo! It just got a little warmer.

532
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:01,517
- There's nothing artificial about <i>that.</i>
- A little acid rain.

533
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:06,634
They dominate a number of pivotal
processes occurring in the soil,

534
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,035
and that's what makes this so exciting.

535
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:12,835
Ladies and gentlemen,
here are Bud and Doyle.

536
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:16,509
Doyle! What's the hot gossip
on the inside?

537
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:21,114
I can't make any comment at this time,

538
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:25,677
but all I know is, if I see one more
massive orgy, I'm movin' to Tibet.

539
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:29,270
And Faulkner? Quit hogging the KY!

540
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,358
Thirty-one,

541
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,914
forty-two, sixty-nine,

542
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,916
seventy-four...

543
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,710
A hundred... a thousand!

544
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,278
Here I come!

545
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:52,075
Rombo! You gotta hide me.

546
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:55,158
Not in here! You'll upset my bugs.

547
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,395
Look out! It's...

548
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,276
May I help you?

549
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,039
- What are these guys?
- Well...

550
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:06,152
They're two of the rarest
lepidoptera in the world.

551
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:09,558
Leppard?
Didn't their drummer lose an arm?

552
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:14,437
No. They're butterflies
from the Brazilian rain forest.

553
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,994
So are you tryin'
to get 'em to start porking?

554
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:21,750
Actually, yes. In nature, the chances
of these two finding each other,

555
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:24,235
or "porking",

556
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:26,669
are very remote.

557
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,633
We hope to breed thousands here.

558
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,189
Easy, Rombo.

559
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:34,314
- Got ya!
- You gotta take me first!

560
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:53,199
<i>(both)</i> Mothra! Come back, Mothra!
Please come back, Mothra!

561
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:56,039
Lepidoptera!

562
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,914
- Monique, should we be doing this?
- Yes!

563
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:03,716
Jen, we are not doing anything wrong.
Besides, it's to save the rain forest.

564
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,788
- Denise.
- Roach.

565
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,876
One word: Raid.

566
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:18,955
Hey, man.

567
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:23,949
She thinks she's cool cos she hangs out
with Bud and Doyle's girlfriends.

568
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:27,436
- She digs me, though.
- Are those Bud and Doyle's girlfriends?

569
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,551
- Yeah.
- Put that back.

570
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:34,474
Excuse me. Are you guys
done with those beers?

571
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:38,275
Thanks, but we're having
too much fun sober.

572
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:42,359
We were just going around
trying to collect empties and recycle 'em.

573
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,869
- Oh! Well, here, take this.
- Take mine.

574
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,516
- There's a lot of waste at these parties.
- That's awfully noble of you.

575
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,870
It's just what we're compelled to do.

576
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,755
We're having a fête to save the rain forest.
If you guys'd like to show your support...

577
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:00,316
- It's not gonna be like this, is it?
- Not at all.

578
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:03,238
- It's gonna be decent.
- It's at the quad.

579
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:07,273
OK, we'll be there.
We'll see you tomorrow. Thanks.

580
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:12,478
Noah, it's been a nonstop moronathon,

581
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:17,196
and I did not dedicate my life to science
to baby-sit a couple of baboons.

582
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:22,075
They eat like savages. At the rate
they're going, we'll run out of foodstuffs.

583
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:25,670
They're going to ruin everything.

584
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,678
- <i>(goat bleats)</i>
- Sliced it!

585
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,473
Damn it, Billy. Damn it, damn it, damn it.

586
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:36,754
How am I supposed to hit a double birdie
with my bogey billy with a shower iron?!

587
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:40,475
You're embarrassing me
in front of my friends!

588
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:44,229
- Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy.
- Come on, Billy.

589
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,556
Anatomically correct.

590
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:01,240
Are you sure this flypaper's gonna work?

591
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:05,956
Positive. It's really sticky. My dad
used it to line my playpen all the time.

592
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:09,470
So you must have been stuck
in this position a lot.

593
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:15,391
Help, Daddy! Please, get me down!
I wet my Huggies! Nobody loves me!

594
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,312
OK! I'll shut up!

595
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:21,876
CD-ROM! You gotta come with us quick.
We got a big surprise for ya.

596
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,276
You've been diagnosed with Ebola,
and you're about to bleed out?

597
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:29,712
No... Doyle's got a boner
and he wants to put it in your ear.

598
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:33,355
No, there's a really big surprise.
We want you to come with us, please.

599
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:36,836
If it's about Faulkner's third nipple,
don't bother. I know that.

600
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:40,191
- Faulkner's got three nipples?
- Yeah.

601
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:43,630
- Cool. Come on.
- Come on, let's go. Hurry.

602
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:47,870
Rommy, we felt pretty awful
when we let all your bugs out.

603
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,437
We promised we wouldn't get a wink
of sleep until we brought back every bug.

604
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,676
You mean you found my bugs?

605
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:56,789
Look!

606
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:00,310
- Giant flypaper!
- I think we got all the little 'squitos,

607
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:02,954

a couple flapping right there.

I gotta get outta here.

We should just relax a little before
Chaulkner chills out, don't you think?

620
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:00,148
What's he gonna do? Expel us?

Me neither. You?

661
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:55,510
- The desert? But we'll starve.
- Not necessarily.

662
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:59,918
It is life on a taut tensile line, but
the desert is an integral part of nature.

663
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:03,589
Unbelievable. So this is how
it's gonna be? <i>Vamos.</i> Get outta here.

00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:11,799
Yes. The idea being that
while we are here, you are there.

anyways any more, OK?

667
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:17,913
We're gonna go start our own Bio-Dome.

668

So don't come knockin' on <i>our</i> door!

All we need are two helpers.

670
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:32,199

Bud? I don't wanna have to eat you.

I don't want you to eat me either.

680
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:36,872
Squirl, the Grim Reaper
is breathing down our necks.

681
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,116
It's not lookin' too good.

682
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:44,358
There's something I have to
get off my chest before we die.

683
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:49,838
Remember that really cute little teeny tiny
turtle you had when we were growin' up

684
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:54,511
that disappeared and they put
your kitty-cat to sleep for eating him?

685
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:58,553
What really happened was
that I stepped on him

686
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:02,195
then flushed him down the toilet
and let the cat take the rap.

687
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:06,472
- Frisky?
- He went down like a champ, Squirl.

688
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:10,752
Remember your uncle divorced your aunt
for sleeping with that flamingo dancer?

689
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:13,440
Her children disowned her,
the church shunned her,

690
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:16,154
she started a drinking binge?

691
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:20,512
That flamingo dancer's outfit
he found was mine.

692
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:25,633
My mom was trying to make me
take lessons to impress the neighbours.

693
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:30,515
So I took the outfit, I hid it in
Aunt Flo's bedroom, I said I got mugged.

694
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:33,029
Aunt Flo's insane now.

695
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:36,473
Yeah, but she has her independence.

696
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:41,594
Remember the great fire of 1979
that supposedly started in your garage

697
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:46,236
when that chipmunk ingested fertiliser
then fell onto a can of kerosene,

698
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:51,195
instantly turning him into a fluffy
little Molotov cocktail that set ablaze,

699
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:55,552
levelling the whole neighbourhood
west of Newton's hardware store?

700
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:57,830
You started that fire?

701
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:04,433
No. But that was pretty cool, huh?

702
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:12,674
- Noah?
- Can we talk to you?

703
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:15,554
Yes.

704
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:19,468
We're concerned about Bud and Doyle.
We think they've been there long enough.

705
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:23,070
- Do you?
- Yes. We can't just leave them there.

706
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:25,509
- They can't survive.
- It would be murder.

707
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:27,915
No... It's progress.

708
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:30,315
We're culling the herd.

709
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:35,275
They are a symbol of everything
that is wrong with this world.

710
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:38,995
They don't care. They don't matter.

711
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:45,594
Doyle? There's a tasty dactyl.

712
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:53,198
Got him, Squirl.

713
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:55,629
I wanna eat you.

714
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:58,838
I wanna eat it with the frog leg.

715
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:01,155
Squirl, wait! Wait!

716
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:03,350

717
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:11,551
<i>(both)</i> No way.

No!

720
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,389
- What am I gonna do?!
- After all we've done...

721
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:24,399
- Oh, my... A boot!
- I can't believe it!

722
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:29,355
I can't believe they would put a boot
on a Bio-Dome scientist's car!

723
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:33,553
It's not like we didn't try
and help the ecological system.

724
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:36,433
Aw, don't cry, Doyle. It's OK.

725
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:40,269
Come on. We'll get you some food.
A little bladder buster?

726
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:43,157
Hey, coach! Pizza!

727
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:45,236
Stop, stop, stop!

728
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:51,830
Here are the pizzas. The bladder buster's

- Bob!
- How'd you get a job?

731
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:03,432
- Fucking President Clinton.
- You had sex with President Clinton?

732
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:07,599
That's really cool.
So, how's my juicy treat?

733
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:12,430
She and that other bimbo,
they picked up two guys at Arizona Tech.

734
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:15,597
They're having a party
to save the environment.

735
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:20,077
- You owe me $57.50, plus a tip.
- What does "in the flesh" mean?

736
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:24,034
I don't know, but I think
it has something to do with tassels.

737
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:26,390
- You gotta take us to this party!
- Right now!

738

740
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:40,151

ATU campus is probably being overrun

741
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:42,999

save-the-environment mania,

742
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:45,793
- and guess who's right in the middle of it?
- Our chicks.

743
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:49,515
They're probably swapping Mark Spitz
with those grape smugglers!

744
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:54,714
No preppy blowhard steals my chick
without a fight. First Frisky, now this.

745
00:54:54,840 --> 00:55:00,119
- All I know is, someone's goin' down!
- Hey, hey! Put the gun away, Stub.

746
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:04,995
Put the gun away. Evil's not a good thing
right now. Just relax. Exhale.

747
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:08,032
All we gotta do, bro,
is out-party the partyers.

748
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:10,799
Bring the mountain to Mohammed.

749
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:14,310
Throw a bigger, badder bash
than any college would ever allow,

750
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:19,275

about the environment too.

00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:21,711

- No.

Mr Leaky, the damage is devastating.

857
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:15,555
The toxins are way off the scale, and the
pH is acidic enough to digest a battery.

858
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:19,192
It took years to build this world,

859
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:23,199
and you geniuses
took only one month to destroy it!

God couldn't work at such a fast pace.

861
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:28,879

- For what?

869

- To clean this place up.
- There's no point in staying.

870
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:59,633
- The ecosystem is dead.
- It's not. It's just thrashed.

871
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:04,470
The aim was life in a sealed environment
without contact from the outside world.

872
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:07,717
The entire experiment
