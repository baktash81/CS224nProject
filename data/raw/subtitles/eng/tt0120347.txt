1
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:46,098
A terrorist arms bazaar
on the Russian border.

2
00:01:10,889 --> 00:01:13,687
Our man's in position.

3
00:01:13,769 --> 00:01:16,727
It's like
a terrorist supermarket.

4
00:01:16,809 --> 00:01:20,563
Chinese Longmark SCUD,
Panther attack helicopter,

5
00:01:20,649 --> 00:01:24,039
Russian mortars
and American rifles.

6
00:01:24,129 --> 00:01:27,041
Chilean mines,
German explosives.

7
00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:29,040
Fun for the whole family.

8
00:01:29,129 --> 00:01:30,881
IDs.

9
00:01:30,969 --> 00:01:33,403
White Knight,
show us the pawns.

10
00:01:33,489 --> 00:01:37,084
Start with that chap
in the middle.

11
00:01:37,169 --> 00:01:40,161
Database ID Search.

12
00:01:41,329 --> 00:01:46,005
We've got our first match.
Satoshi Isigura.

13
00:01:46,089 --> 00:01:48,603
Wanted for
the Tokyo subway attack.

14
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:52,318
Currently working for the
insurgent force in Zaire.

15
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:55,526
Henry Gupta. American.

16
00:01:55,609 --> 00:01:57,804
Practically invented
techno-terrorism.

17
00:01:57,889 --> 00:02:01,723
Started out as a student
radical in the Sixties.

18
00:02:01,809 --> 00:02:04,403
- Now works for cash.
- Zoom in there.

19
00:02:04,489 --> 00:02:06,320
An American encoder.

20
00:02:06,409 --> 00:02:09,526
They use it to control
navigation satellites.

21
00:02:09,609 --> 00:02:11,406
Will the CIA be more upset

22
00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:14,162
that they lost it
or we found it?

23
00:02:14,249 --> 00:02:16,046
Excuse me, Admiral?

24
00:02:16,129 --> 00:02:17,767
We've seen enough, M.

25
00:02:17,849 --> 00:02:20,682
This is now
a military operation.

26
00:02:20,769 --> 00:02:25,081
Are your troops prepared
for that kind of firepower?

27
00:02:25,169 --> 00:02:28,047
We have election
in Moscow next week.

28
00:02:28,129 --> 00:02:31,405
The president said any loss
of life is unacceptable.

29
00:02:31,489 --> 00:02:33,480
We'll take the naval option.

30
00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:36,606
One strike takes out
half the world's terrorists.

31
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:38,168
I must protest.

32
00:02:38,249 --> 00:02:41,480
Get me the Chester.
Let's not waste time.

33
00:02:41,569 --> 00:02:45,881
- My man isn't finished.
- Authorisation to fire.

34
00:02:45,969 --> 00:02:49,325
Get your man out of there.
His job's over.

35
00:02:50,489 --> 00:02:52,480
Prepare to fire.

36
00:02:54,009 --> 00:02:56,239
On my count.

37
00:02:56,329 --> 00:03:00,481
- 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
- Missile away.

38
00:03:03,929 --> 00:03:06,124
Time to target.
4 minutes, 8 seconds.

39
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:10,719
White Knight,
4 minutes to impact.

40
00:03:10,809 --> 00:03:14,358
It's on the screen
in front of me.

41
00:03:14,449 --> 00:03:17,043
It's a jeep in front of a plane.

42
00:03:17,129 --> 00:03:19,040
Now get out of there.

43
00:03:19,129 --> 00:03:21,643
- What's going on?
- You will not wait!

44
00:03:21,729 --> 00:03:24,289
What is your man
waiting for?

45
00:03:24,369 --> 00:03:27,122
White Knight... Oh, my God!

46
00:03:28,329 --> 00:03:32,242
Soviet nuclear torpedoes!
If the Cruise hits them...

47
00:03:32,329 --> 00:03:34,524
Abort the missile.

48
00:03:34,609 --> 00:03:37,123
H.M.S. Chester. Urgent.

49
00:03:38,569 --> 00:03:41,083
Abort missile. Abort missile.

50
00:03:41,689 --> 00:03:43,600
- Abort missile.
- Abort missile.

51
00:03:45,569 --> 00:03:48,288
Captain, missile out of range.

52
00:03:48,369 --> 00:03:50,007
Unable to destroy.

53
00:03:55,089 --> 00:03:57,728
Alert NATO, the Pentagon.

54
00:03:57,809 --> 00:04:00,881
- Will it trigger the torpedoes?
- It might.

55
00:04:00,969 --> 00:04:03,039
There is enough plutonium

56
00:04:03,129 --> 00:04:05,643
to make Chernobyl
look like picnic.

57
00:04:05,729 --> 00:04:09,039
Can't you people
keep anything locked up?

58
00:04:09,129 --> 00:04:11,689
Get him out now!

59
00:04:11,769 --> 00:04:14,920
- White Knight, come in.
- Keep trying!

60
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:35,152
Filthy habit.

61
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:50,347
I got the encoder!

62
00:04:58,513 --> 00:05:00,788
- What's he doing?
- His job.

63
00:05:07,273 --> 00:05:09,628
He's going for the bombs.

64
00:05:24,353 --> 00:05:26,071
Get that jeep.

65
00:05:35,753 --> 00:05:37,232
Get out, James.

66
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:08,024
One minute till impact.

67
00:06:57,201 --> 00:06:58,600
30 seconds.

68
00:08:47,481 --> 00:08:49,392
Backseat driver.

69
00:08:51,401 --> 00:08:54,074
White Knight to White Rook.

70
00:08:54,161 --> 00:08:59,554
Ask the admiral where he'd like
his bombs delivered.

71
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:11,000
Sound the alarm.

72
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:18,127
The ship has been
overflown by two Chinese MiGs.

73
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:21,008
We believe
they have hostile intent.

74
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:23,650
Advance to action stations.

75
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:27,367
This is your last warning.

76
00:12:27,367 --> 00:12:29,039
This is your last warning.

77
00:12:29,127 --> 00:12:30,924
You are in Chinese
territorial waters.

78
00:12:36,588 --> 00:12:40,342
Maximum speed.
Come left 40 degrees.

79
00:12:41,468 --> 00:12:45,586
- Revolution, 1-6-0.
- Are they insane?

80
00:12:48,948 --> 00:12:52,543
Sir, the Chinese pilot
insists he will fire

81
00:12:52,628 --> 00:12:54,903
if we don't turn round.

82
00:12:54,988 --> 00:12:56,819
Send this.

83
00:12:56,908 --> 00:12:59,547
"We are in international waters

84
00:12:59,628 --> 00:13:02,301
and will defend ourselves
if attacked."

85
00:13:04,028 --> 00:13:06,906
Are we absolutely
sure of our position?

86
00:13:06,988 --> 00:13:10,424
Yes, sir.
An exact satellite fix.

87
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:13,030
Carver Media Group Network
Tamburg

88
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:14,702
Carver Media Group Network
Tamburg

89
00:13:41,752 --> 00:13:43,982
Captain,
we are ready to launch.

90
00:13:44,072 --> 00:13:46,791
Shut down the engines.

91
00:13:46,872 --> 00:13:50,660
The sea drill isn't
invisible to radar.

92
00:13:56,741 --> 00:13:59,813
We'll launch next time
the MiGs fly by.

93
00:13:59,901 --> 00:14:02,779
The British will think
it's a Chinese torpedo.

94
00:14:02,861 --> 00:14:04,499
I'll report in.

95
00:14:06,861 --> 00:14:11,935
Stamper to Hamburg.
Phase one is in progress.

96
00:14:12,021 --> 00:14:15,730
I'll report back to you
with an update.

97
00:14:21,301 --> 00:14:26,694
- The MiGs are passing again.
- Let's start the show.

98
00:14:38,501 --> 00:14:39,934
Start the drill.

99
00:14:46,981 --> 00:14:50,132
- Release it.
- Sea drill away.

100
00:14:56,221 --> 00:14:58,815
Green 3-0. Torpedo!
Torpedo!

101
00:14:58,901 --> 00:15:00,698
8-1-6 CCMs!

102
00:15:00,781 --> 00:15:02,578
Hard right, 1-4-1.

103
00:15:02,661 --> 00:15:06,176
There's no sonar contact.
The MiGs must have dropped it.

104
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:11,896
- It's gonna hit!
- Brace, brace, brace!

105
00:15:20,141 --> 00:15:23,053
- Target 1200.
- Knock knock.

106
00:15:39,501 --> 00:15:40,934
Go upstairs.

107
00:15:52,181 --> 00:15:55,093
- Turn left.
- Rotating 90 degrees.

108
00:16:06,581 --> 00:16:09,175
They're wondering why
the torpedo hasn't exploded.

109
00:16:09,261 --> 00:16:11,377
Full damage report!

110
00:16:15,861 --> 00:16:17,817
- Sonar's off-line.
- Backup power!

111
00:16:19,821 --> 00:16:24,053
- Switch to alternate supply.
- Three generators down, sir.

112
00:16:24,141 --> 00:16:28,020
- Flooding on foredeck aft.
- Starboard down 14 degrees.

113
00:16:28,101 --> 00:16:29,978
Yeoman, send to Admiralty .

114
00:16:30,061 --> 00:16:32,336
"Torpedoed by Chinese MiGs.
Sinking."

115
00:16:32,421 --> 00:16:34,332
Give them our position.

116
00:16:34,421 --> 00:16:36,491
Right. Abandon ship.

117
00:16:36,581 --> 00:16:40,130
- Out! Out!
- Abandon ship!

118
00:16:55,701 --> 00:16:57,771
One missile at the MiGs.

119
00:17:10,981 --> 00:17:12,937
Maintain radio silence.

120
00:17:19,141 --> 00:17:21,416
Their last broadcast, sir.

121
00:17:22,581 --> 00:17:25,300
Mr Gupta's encoder worked.

122
00:17:25,381 --> 00:17:28,657
They gave their final position
70 miles from here.

123
00:17:28,741 --> 00:17:31,414
The British navy
will never find them.

124
00:17:32,661 --> 00:17:35,095
Survivors in the water.

125
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:51,771
< Mr Stamper.

126
00:17:51,861 --> 00:17:54,250
I'm having fun
with my headlines.

127
00:17:54,341 --> 00:17:57,174
I need the exact number
of survivors.

128
00:17:57,261 --> 00:18:00,890
Make sure you use
the right ammunition.

129
00:18:00,981 --> 00:18:02,460
Yes, sir.

130
00:18:04,781 --> 00:18:06,499
Delicious.

131
00:18:33,621 --> 00:18:35,930
Start the recovery operation.

132
00:18:36,021 --> 00:18:37,977
Send our divers down.

133
00:18:59,381 --> 00:19:03,090
Mr Gupta, phase one is complete.

134
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:14,530
Good morning,
my golden retrievers.

135
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:16,646
Good morning,
my golden retrievers.

136
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:21,645
What havoc shall the Carver
Media Group create today? News?

137
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:23,960
Floods in Pakistan,
riots in Paris,

138
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:27,167
- a plane crash in California.
- Excellent.

139
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:31,084
Mr Jones, are we ready
to release our new software?

140
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,162
Yes, sir. As requested,
it's full of bugs,

141
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,844
so people will be forced
to upgrade for years.

142
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:38,079
Outstanding.

143
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:41,207
Mr Wallace, call the president.

144
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:44,760
Tell him if he doesn't
lower the cable rates,

145
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:48,001
we'll release the video
of him with a cheerleader.

146
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:49,364
Inspired, sir.

147
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:51,759
Then release the tape anyway.

148
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:53,408
Consider him slimed.

149
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:55,003
Excuse me.

150
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:59,124
- He's on transponder 7.
- Mr Stamper?

151
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:01,929
Phase 2 is underway.

152
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:04,205
I have the videotape.

153
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:08,078
I haven't seen it,
but I'm told it's excellent.

154
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:12,163
There were 17 survivors
for your headlines.

155
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,524
Good work, Stamper.

156
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:17,598
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

157
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:20,363
Keep it in a safe place.

158
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:25,449
Gentlemen and ladies,
hold the presses.

159
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:27,919
This just in.

160
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:30,808
By a curious quirk of fate,

161
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:32,801
we have the perfect story

162
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:36,200
with which to launch our
satellite news network tonight.

163
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:40,408
A small crisis is brewing
in the South China Seas.

164
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:43,243
I want full newspaper coverage.

165
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:48,245
I want magazine stories,
books, films, TV, radio!

166
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:51,288
I want us on air 24 hours a day!

167
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:53,201
This is our moment!

168
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:56,839
And a billion people
around this planet

169
00:20:56,930 --> 00:21:00,764
will watch it, hear it
and read about it

170
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:03,489
from the Carver Media Group.

171
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:07,565
There's no news...
like bad news.

172
00:21:17,836 --> 00:21:21,829
 am pleased
with your progress, Mr Bond.

173
00:21:22,836 --> 00:21:28,832
I've always enjoyed studying
a new tongue, Professor.

174
00:21:29,596 --> 00:21:33,669
One might say
you have a natural ability.

175
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:36,788
But practice makes perfect.

176
00:21:41,996 --> 00:21:44,430
Hmm. Who's that?

177
00:21:45,956 --> 00:21:49,426
How do you say
"I'm not here" in Danish?

178
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:51,074
Ignore it.

179
00:21:51,156 --> 00:21:54,944
Words they don't have
in their vocabulary.

180
00:21:57,596 --> 00:21:59,075
Bond here.

181
00:21:59,156 --> 00:22:01,226
Go to a secure line, 007.

182
00:22:01,316 --> 00:22:04,149
Going to scrambler,
channel...4.

183
00:22:04,236 --> 00:22:06,750
It was in international waters.

184
00:22:06,836 --> 00:22:08,952
We can't be certain.

185
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:11,709
James, where are you?

186
00:22:11,796 --> 00:22:16,586
Oh, Moneypenny.
Um...I'm just up here at Oxford,

187
00:22:16,676 --> 00:22:19,065
brushing up on a little Danish.

188
00:22:19,156 --> 00:22:20,305
Little?

189
00:22:20,396 --> 00:22:22,864
You'll have to kiss off
your lesson, James.

190
00:22:22,956 --> 00:22:24,992
We've got a situation here.

191
00:22:25,076 --> 00:22:27,465
We're sending
the fleet to China.

192
00:22:27,556 --> 00:22:30,753
Uh-huh.
I'll be there in, uh...

193
00:22:30,836 --> 00:22:32,349
in an hour.

194
00:22:32,436 --> 00:22:33,915
30 minutes.

195
00:22:35,476 --> 00:22:37,353
Goodbye, my sweet.

196
00:22:37,436 --> 00:22:40,872
You always were
a cunning linguist, James.

197
00:22:43,556 --> 00:22:44,955
- Don't ask.
- Don't tell.

198
00:22:58,001 --> 00:23:01,038
We know exactly
where that ship was!

199
00:23:01,121 --> 00:23:04,830
The Global Positioning
Satellites do not lie!

200
00:23:04,921 --> 00:23:09,437
Our Singapore station picked up
a mysterious GPS signal.

201
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:12,638
It could have sent
that ship off course.

202
00:23:12,721 --> 00:23:15,952
- I have a missing frigate...
- I'm aware of that!

203
00:23:16,041 --> 00:23:20,159
- All you want to do...
- Is prevent World War III !

204
00:23:20,241 --> 00:23:24,075
I don't think sending an armada
is the way to do it.

205
00:23:24,161 --> 00:23:26,436
Where did this signal come from?

206
00:23:26,521 --> 00:23:29,319
- We're still investigating.
- Investigating!

207
00:23:29,401 --> 00:23:32,916
M, sometimes I don't think you
have the balls for this job.

208
00:23:33,001 --> 00:23:37,279
At least I don't have
to think with them all the time.

209
00:23:38,321 --> 00:23:41,040
That's enough.
Where do we stand?

210
00:23:41,121 --> 00:23:45,637
It was an unprovoked attack on
a ship in international waters.

211
00:23:45,721 --> 00:23:48,633
We send in the fleet and prepare
for full retaliation.

212
00:23:48,721 --> 00:23:49,995
Moderation.

213
00:23:50,081 --> 00:23:52,993
We investigate rather than send
the entire British navy

214
00:23:53,081 --> 00:23:56,312
within 10 minutes of
the world's largest air force.

215
00:23:56,401 --> 00:23:59,313
- When will our ships get there?
- 48 hours, sir.

216
00:23:59,401 --> 00:24:03,076
Christ! The press are
already screaming for blood.

217
00:24:03,161 --> 00:24:06,949
We don't want
to escalate the situation.

218
00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:10,829
I'm afraid it may be too late.

219
00:24:10,921 --> 00:24:13,913
"17 British Sailors Murdered"?

220
00:24:14,001 --> 00:24:17,391
According to
Vietnamese officials,

221
00:24:17,481 --> 00:24:20,075
the victims were riddled
with ammunition

222
00:24:20,161 --> 00:24:22,516
used by the Chinese air force.

223
00:24:22,601 --> 00:24:24,512
- Did you leak this?
- No!

224
00:24:24,601 --> 00:24:26,956
It's the first I've heard of it.

225
00:24:27,041 --> 00:24:31,000
Well, this settles it.
We send in the fleet.

226
00:24:31,081 --> 00:24:35,040
M, you have 48 hours
to investigate.

227
00:24:42,121 --> 00:24:44,919
There is one strange thing.

228
00:24:45,001 --> 00:24:48,710
The Vietnamese only found
our sailors three hours ago.

229
00:24:48,801 --> 00:24:51,361
How'd they get the paper
out so fast?

230
00:24:51,441 --> 00:24:54,911
"Tomorrow" knew before
the Vietnamese government did.

231
00:24:55,001 --> 00:24:58,596
How much do you know
about Elliot Carver, 007?

232
00:24:58,681 --> 00:25:02,720
World-wide media baron,
able to topple governments.

233
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:05,395
Carver owns that newspaper
"Tomorrow".

234
00:25:05,481 --> 00:25:10,509
That mysterious signal came
from one of Carver's satellites.

235
00:25:10,601 --> 00:25:13,069
The PM would have my head

236
00:25:13,161 --> 00:25:15,391
if he knew you were
investigating him.

237
00:25:15,481 --> 00:25:17,278
I'm sending you to Hamburg.

238
00:25:17,361 --> 00:25:20,398
There's a party tonight
at Carver's media centre.

239
00:25:20,481 --> 00:25:22,995
They've launched
a new satellite.

240
00:25:23,081 --> 00:25:25,834
He can now reach
every human being on earth.

241
00:25:25,921 --> 00:25:29,391
Except the Chinese,
who've refused broadcast rights.

242
00:25:31,841 --> 00:25:35,277
James, your ticket, cover story
and car reservation.

243
00:25:35,361 --> 00:25:36,953
Sign here, please.

244
00:25:37,041 --> 00:25:40,636
You had a relationship
with Carver's wife, Paris.

245
00:25:40,721 --> 00:25:45,237
That was a long time ago, M,
before she married.

246
00:25:46,961 --> 00:25:49,919
I didn't realise
it was public knowledge.

247
00:25:50,001 --> 00:25:52,310
Queen and country , James.

248
00:25:52,401 --> 00:25:56,872
Find out whether Carver sent
that ship off-course and why.

249
00:25:56,961 --> 00:25:59,839
Use your relationship
with Mrs Carver.

250
00:25:59,921 --> 00:26:03,880
- I doubt if she'll remember me.
- Remind her.

251
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:07,358
Then pump her for information.

252
00:26:07,441 --> 00:26:11,673
You just have to decide how much
pumping is needed, James.

253
00:26:11,761 --> 00:26:15,470
If only that were true
of you and I, Moneypenny.

254
00:26:32,433 --> 00:26:36,551
Passengers are asked
not to leave baggage unattended.

255
00:26:50,513 --> 00:26:53,823
If you just sign here, Mr Bond.

256
00:26:57,393 --> 00:27:00,271
It's the insurance damage waiver

257
00:27:00,353 --> 00:27:03,186
for your beautiful new car.

258
00:27:03,273 --> 00:27:05,741
Will you need
collision coverage?

259
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:06,743
Yes.

260
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:08,186
Fire?

261
00:27:08,273 --> 00:27:10,389
Probably.

262
00:27:10,473 --> 00:27:12,987
- Property destruction?
- Definitely.

263
00:27:13,073 --> 00:27:14,745
Personal injury?

264
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:17,063
I hope not,
but accidents happen.

265
00:27:17,153 --> 00:27:19,189
They frequently do with you.

266
00:27:19,273 --> 00:27:23,505
Well, that takes care
of the normal wear and tear.

267
00:27:23,593 --> 00:27:26,153
Do I need any other protection?

268
00:27:26,233 --> 00:27:28,030
Only from me, 007,

269
00:27:28,113 --> 00:27:31,230
unless you bring that car back
in pristine order.

270
00:27:31,313 --> 00:27:33,463
- Shall we?
- Shall we?

271
00:27:36,553 --> 00:27:39,306
Your new BMW 750.

272
00:27:39,393 --> 00:27:41,111
All the usual refinements -

273
00:27:41,193 --> 00:27:45,232
machine guns, rockets
and a GPS tracking system.

274
00:27:45,313 --> 00:27:46,746
Welcome.

275
00:27:46,833 --> 00:27:50,223
Please fasten seat belt
and obey all instructions.

276
00:27:50,313 --> 00:27:53,225
Thought you'd pay
more attention to a female.

277
00:27:53,313 --> 00:27:56,385
I think we've met.

278
00:27:56,473 --> 00:28:00,022
I am not interested
in your sordid escapades.

279
00:28:00,113 --> 00:28:02,149
Your new telephone.

280
00:28:02,233 --> 00:28:04,906
Talk here, listen here.

281
00:28:04,993 --> 00:28:07,382
So that's what
I've been doing wrong.

282
00:28:07,473 --> 00:28:08,872
Look.

283
00:28:08,953 --> 00:28:12,263
It also includes
a fingerprint scanner

284
00:28:12,353 --> 00:28:15,151
and a 20,000-volt
security system

285
00:28:15,233 --> 00:28:18,111
And this I'm
particularly proud of -

286
00:28:18,193 --> 00:28:20,946
the remote control
for your car.

287
00:28:21,033 --> 00:28:24,264
Tap twice. 1, 2.

288
00:28:25,673 --> 00:28:27,948
Draw your finger very slowly

289
00:28:28,033 --> 00:28:30,467
across the pad

290
00:28:30,553 --> 00:28:33,272
to drive the car.

291
00:28:38,033 --> 00:28:41,548
It's difficult to drive,
but with practice...

292
00:28:41,633 --> 00:28:44,943
Let's see how she responds
to my touch.

293
00:29:07,673 --> 00:29:09,584
Think we understand
each other.

294
00:29:09,673 --> 00:29:11,425
Grow up, 007.

295
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:28,680
Engine running.
Please shut door.

296
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:31,433
Engine running.
Please shut door.

297
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,515
Don't let her push you around.

298
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:45,927
There's absolutely no truth

299
00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:47,966
in this malicious rumour

300
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:51,087
that I ran
Mad Cow disease stories

301
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:54,401
simply because Angus Black,
the British beef baron,

302
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:57,880
lost £10,000 to me at poker
and refused to pay.

303
00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:02,521
Nor did I take 100 million
francs from the French

304
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:05,170
to keep the stories running.

305
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:08,768
- Excuse me, Mr Carver.
- Yes?

306
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:11,159
This is the new banker, Mr...

307
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:14,128
Bond. James Bond.

308
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:17,088
I seem to collect bankers.

309
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:22,843
Mr Bond, how is the market
reacting to the crisis?

310
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:25,728
Currencies are off.
Your stock is soaring.

311
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:28,882
I don't believe we've met.

312
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:30,926
Elliot Carver.

313
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:34,082
Wai Lin,
from the New China News Agency.

314
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:37,799
I don't recall seeing
your name on the guest list.

315
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:41,121
It's not. I snuck in.

316
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:42,928
Why, my dear?

317
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:45,570
I wanted to meet you.

318
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:50,326
Outstanding. I admire a woman
who takes the initiative.

319
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:53,720
You should work
in my Beijing bureau.

320
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:55,607
Mr Carver, you don't have
a bureau in Beijing.

321
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:57,169
Call me Elliot.

322
00:31:06,810 --> 00:31:11,247
I always wondered
how I'd feel if I saw you again.

323
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:22,206
Now I know.

324
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:24,485
Was it something I said?

325
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:28,040
How about the words
"I'll be right back"?

326
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:31,165
Something came up.

327
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:33,525
Something always came up.

328
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:38,047
- And how are you, Paris?
- Much better now. We're even.

329
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:39,609
Drink, Mrs Carver?

330
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:43,160
Mr Bond will have a vodka
martini, shaken, not stirred.

331
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:46,401
Mrs Carver will have a tequila.
Straight shot.

332
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:51,439
No. Mrs Carver will have a glass
of Mr Carver's champagne.

333
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:54,568
You've moved up
in the world, Paris.

334
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:57,960
And tonight, you're a banker.
I saw the guest list.

335
00:31:58,050 --> 00:32:01,929
Do you still sleep with
a gun under your pillow?

336
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:16,165
- To you.
- No. To the gun.

337
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:24,526
I take it this isn't
a social visit.

338
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:27,204
Your husband may be in trouble.

339
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:31,363
If you're going after him,
you're the one in trouble.

340
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:35,079
It's either him or someone
in his organisation.

341
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:38,242
And you figured you could
charm the dirt out of me.

342
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:41,083
No. That wasn't my plan.

343
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:44,003
Good. Because I've made my bed.

344
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:47,765
You don't sleep in it anymore.

345
00:32:47,850 --> 00:32:50,000
There you are.

346
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:53,521
Darling.

347
00:32:55,610 --> 00:32:58,283
I've been looking for you.

348
00:32:58,370 --> 00:33:01,601
Meet Wai Lin,
New China News Agency.

349
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:04,329
- Hello, Mrs Carver.
- It's a pleasure.

350
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:06,765
And this is James Bond.

351
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:09,318
You know each other?

352
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:11,207
Oh, we're old friends.

353
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:14,123
He dated my roommate
in Zurich.

354
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:18,679
I'm thinking of getting
Wai Lin behind a news desk.

355
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:23,048
I'm sure she won't
resist...too much.

356
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:27,760
Ahem. Elliot, I was wondering
about your satellites,

357
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:29,966
your global position.

358
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:33,201
They're merely tools
for information, Mr Bond.

359
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:34,803
Or disinformation.

360
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:37,802
If you wanted to manipulate
the course of governments

361
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:40,962
or people...or even a ship.

362
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:45,759
That's very interesting,
Mr Bond.

363
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:49,365
You have a vivid imagination...
for a banker.

364
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:51,805
You should write a novel.

365
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:55,565
Heavens, no.
I'd be lost at sea. Adrift.

366
00:33:57,450 --> 00:33:59,247
Mr Carver.

367
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:02,561
Hmm? Ah.

368
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:05,927
It's time to begin
the festivities.

369
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:07,363
Excuse me. Darling?

370
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:14,644
How do you really know him?

371
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:17,483
He's a banker.
I met him in Zurich.

372
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:19,765
You're a terrible liar, dear.

373
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:24,839
I have a problem with a banker.

374
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:27,205
Could I see you a moment?

375
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:30,441
Ladies and gentlemen.

376
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:36,364
Mr Carver's broadcast will
be starting in 10 minutes.

377
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:42,328
What kind of banking
do you specialise in, Mr Bond?

378
00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:44,844
Hostile take-overs.

379
00:34:44,930 --> 00:34:46,807
Shall we?

380
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:59,839
Carver must feel at home
in a room like this.

381
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:02,285
It's nice to talk to the world.

382
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:05,280
Looks like there's someone

383
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:07,440
who wants to talk to you.

384
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:12,402
Mr Bond, you have
an urgent phone call.

385
00:35:18,834 --> 00:35:23,112
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are live in 5, 4, 3,

386
00:35:23,194 --> 00:35:24,786
2...

387
00:35:24,874 --> 00:35:26,671
Good evening.

388
00:35:26,754 --> 00:35:31,225
Tonight's broadcast was supposed
to celebrate the completion

389
00:35:31,314 --> 00:35:34,465
of the Carver Global
Satellite Network.

390
00:35:34,554 --> 00:35:36,465
But, as you're well aware,

391
00:35:36,554 --> 00:35:41,708
terrible conflict looms tonight
in the South China Sea,

392
00:35:41,794 --> 00:35:43,671
which has the potential

393
00:35:43,754 --> 00:35:47,269
to destroy
every human being on earth.

394
00:35:47,354 --> 00:35:51,711
I want to assure my viewers
that I, Elliot Carver,

395
00:35:51,794 --> 00:35:55,389
have spoken with
the prime minister in London

396
00:35:55,474 --> 00:35:58,546
and the chairman
in Beijing...

397
00:36:01,394 --> 00:36:03,908
It's a soundproof room, Mr Bond.

398
00:36:03,994 --> 00:36:06,110
Nobody hears you scream.

399
00:36:09,434 --> 00:36:14,906
- We have made contact.
- Make him uncomfortable.

400
00:36:14,994 --> 00:36:18,384
I'll be there in a few moments.

401
00:36:18,474 --> 00:36:20,863
..with its printing presses

402
00:36:20,954 --> 00:36:23,991
and its satellite facilities
linking every...

403
00:36:27,154 --> 00:36:30,829
You seem very concerned
about Mr Carver's business.

404
00:36:33,434 --> 00:36:35,186
He wants to know why.

405
00:36:35,274 --> 00:36:38,425
Why did I do it, you ask.

406
00:36:38,514 --> 00:36:40,709
The answer is simple: power.

407
00:36:40,794 --> 00:36:46,346
The power to illuminate
the far corners of the globe,

408
00:36:46,434 --> 00:36:50,712
for higher understanding between
the people of this great planet.

409
00:36:50,794 --> 00:36:53,388
Maybe we play
a number on his head.

410
00:37:00,434 --> 00:37:02,823
What do I expect in return?

411
00:37:02,914 --> 00:37:05,474
World-wide domination.

412
00:37:05,554 --> 00:37:09,547
Complete, utter, total
world-wide domination,

413
00:37:09,634 --> 00:37:13,343
but not over government
or religion or ideology.

414
00:37:13,434 --> 00:37:17,222
Over tyranny
and isolation and news.

415
00:37:18,674 --> 00:37:22,030
The Carver Network
has the ability. to reach...

416
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:23,547
Herr Stamper!

417
00:37:23,634 --> 00:37:25,750
But do not fear me,

418
00:37:25,834 --> 00:37:29,668
for tonight I reveal
my Declaration of Principles,

419
00:37:29,754 --> 00:37:32,871
a promise to the men
and women of this planet

420
00:37:32,954 --> 00:37:36,105
whom I so humbly serve.

421
00:37:36,194 --> 00:37:41,268
I promise to report the news
without fear or favour.

422
00:37:41,354 --> 00:37:44,710
I promise to be a force
for good in this world.

423
00:37:44,794 --> 00:37:46,193
Fighting injustice,

424
00:37:46,274 --> 00:37:49,505
crushing intolerance,
battling inhumanity...

425
00:37:49,594 --> 00:37:52,188
It's time...

426
00:37:54,234 --> 00:37:56,270
..for a station break.

427
00:37:56,354 --> 00:37:59,027
..that is the goal
of the Carver...

428
00:37:59,114 --> 00:38:01,423
What's happened?

429
00:38:01,514 --> 00:38:03,550
- We've lost power.
- What?!

430
00:38:10,314 --> 00:38:12,987
Ladies and gentlemen,
please stay calm.

431
00:38:13,074 --> 00:38:16,384
We will go on
in a few minutes time.

432
00:38:16,474 --> 00:38:19,830
You don't know? You're fired!

433
00:39:03,994 --> 00:39:06,792
And in a rather
embarrassing note,

434
00:39:06,874 --> 00:39:10,389
media mogul Elliot Carver
was cut off the air tonight

435
00:39:10,474 --> 00:39:15,628
during the inaugural broadcast
of his satellite network.

436
00:39:15,714 --> 00:39:18,148
Sorry, Elliot, we didn't do it.

437
00:39:19,874 --> 00:39:22,434
Glorious evening, wasn't it?

438
00:39:22,514 --> 00:39:26,587
Ignore those people.
These things happen.

439
00:39:26,674 --> 00:39:29,347
Not to me. Not to me!

440
00:39:37,394 --> 00:39:42,946
When I was 16, I went to work
for a newspaper in Hong Kong.

441
00:39:43,034 --> 00:39:44,945
It was a rag,

442
00:39:45,034 --> 00:39:48,231
but the editor taught me
one important lesson.

443
00:39:48,314 --> 00:39:53,707
The key to a great story
is not who or what or when...

444
00:39:54,674 --> 00:39:56,904
but why.

445
00:39:57,714 --> 00:40:02,230
Your friend, Mr Bond,
made a mess tonight.

446
00:40:02,314 --> 00:40:07,104
- I want to know why.
- I told you, I barely know him.

447
00:40:08,514 --> 00:40:10,027
Barely?

448
00:40:35,167 --> 00:40:37,601
I was curious

449
00:40:37,687 --> 00:40:39,882
who Carver would send.

450
00:40:39,967 --> 00:40:42,401
He's on to you.

451
00:40:42,487 --> 00:40:46,765
Well, we know where you stand.

452
00:40:46,847 --> 00:40:49,202
You've made your bed.

453
00:40:49,887 --> 00:40:52,765
I'm standing in your doorway.

454
00:40:56,487 --> 00:40:58,717
Then turn around and go home.

455
00:40:58,807 --> 00:41:02,766
Tell him you didn't
get anything out of me.

456
00:41:05,807 --> 00:41:08,367
That's it? Go home?

457
00:41:08,447 --> 00:41:12,565
I didn't ask you
to get involved in this.

458
00:41:12,647 --> 00:41:14,922
It's too late for that.

459
00:41:22,367 --> 00:41:24,801
Why did you marry him?

460
00:41:24,887 --> 00:41:27,685
He told me he loved me.

461
00:41:27,767 --> 00:41:30,122
That always sounds good.

462
00:41:30,207 --> 00:41:35,235
I used to look in the papers
every day for your obituary.

463
00:41:35,327 --> 00:41:39,002
I'm sorry.
I keep disappointing you.

464
00:41:45,007 --> 00:41:46,998
What was it, James?

465
00:41:50,247 --> 00:41:52,556
Did I get too close?

466
00:41:56,367 --> 00:41:59,643
Did I get too close
for comfort?

467
00:42:10,847 --> 00:42:12,565
Yes.

468
00:42:57,927 --> 00:42:59,883
I missed you.

469
00:43:06,487 --> 00:43:08,523
What did you find?

470
00:43:08,607 --> 00:43:12,395
I hacked into the bank.
They're using SS-L2, 128...

471
00:43:12,487 --> 00:43:15,763
Spare me the techno-babble.

472
00:43:15,847 --> 00:43:18,486
Bond's got a perfect
employment record.

473
00:43:18,567 --> 00:43:21,604
He's crossed every T,
he's dotted every I.

474
00:43:21,687 --> 00:43:23,598
- Which means?
- Government agent.

475
00:43:23,687 --> 00:43:28,715
If it sounds too good
to be true, it always is.

476
00:43:29,687 --> 00:43:32,440
Do you think my wife knows?

477
00:43:35,487 --> 00:43:38,843
If you dial down
the ambient noise...

478
00:43:39,367 --> 00:43:44,077
James, do you still sleep
with a gun under your pillow?

479
00:43:44,167 --> 00:43:46,237
Play it again.

480
00:43:48,047 --> 00:43:51,676
Do you still sleep
with a gun under your pillow?

481
00:43:51,767 --> 00:43:54,964
I think we should
set an appointment for my wife

482
00:43:55,047 --> 00:43:57,038
with the doctor.

483
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:08,039
Do you still sleep
with a gun under your pillow?

484
00:44:14,007 --> 00:44:17,204
- I have to go.
- No, you don't.

485
00:44:17,287 --> 00:44:20,199
I can get you
out of the country.

486
00:44:20,287 --> 00:44:24,724
No one can protect me
from him, not even you.

487
00:44:24,807 --> 00:44:28,482
- You have a choice.
- Only if you let him go.

488
00:44:28,567 --> 00:44:30,876
I can't do that.

489
00:44:32,967 --> 00:44:37,483
He has a secret lab
on the top floor.

490
00:44:37,567 --> 00:44:40,127
Paris, you don't
have to do this.

491
00:44:40,207 --> 00:44:42,675
Don't argue with me, James.

492
00:44:44,607 --> 00:44:46,404
You know...

493
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:49,443
this job of yours...

494
00:44:51,887 --> 00:44:55,038
It's murder on relationships.

495
00:46:11,212 --> 00:46:14,010
Until I get back next week,

496
00:46:14,092 --> 00:46:17,129
I want two guards
24 hours a day.

497
00:46:17,212 --> 00:46:21,171
- Nobody gets in.
- We'll take care of it.

498
00:46:23,052 --> 00:46:26,761
What do we do
with the satellite?

499
00:46:26,852 --> 00:46:30,970
Send this thing off
to the launch site.

500
00:46:31,052 --> 00:46:34,727
And be careful.
It's worth $300 million.

501
00:48:13,332 --> 00:48:14,401
Looking for a news story?

502
00:50:18,732 --> 00:50:21,724
They'll print anything
these days.

503
00:51:22,057 --> 00:51:23,456
Yes?

504
00:51:23,537 --> 00:51:27,246
Good morning, Mr Bond.
Elliot Carver.

505
00:51:27,337 --> 00:51:30,727
I believe you've got
two items that belong to me.

506
00:51:30,817 --> 00:51:33,012
What are you talking about?

507
00:51:33,097 --> 00:51:35,053
The red box, Mr Bond.

508
00:51:35,137 --> 00:51:38,288
And my wife in your hotel room.

509
00:51:50,177 --> 00:51:51,769
He's coming.

510
00:51:57,017 --> 00:51:59,212
Fingerprint I.D. accepted.

511
00:52:06,017 --> 00:52:08,292
Select security system level.

512
00:52:30,217 --> 00:52:32,890
Tell me if you find the encoder.

513
00:52:32,977 --> 00:52:35,207
- Call me immediately.
- Ja.

514
00:52:44,817 --> 00:52:48,332
The President said
he can "feel their pain."

515
00:52:48,417 --> 00:52:49,850
Some late news -

516
00:52:49,937 --> 00:52:53,850
it is with great sadness
that we announce the death

517
00:52:53,937 --> 00:52:55,689
of Paris Carver,

518
00:52:55,777 --> 00:52:58,769
the wife of Elliot Carver,

519
00:52:58,857 --> 00:53:01,929
chairman of this network.

520
00:53:02,017 --> 00:53:03,530
According to police
in Hamburg, Germany,

521
00:53:03,617 --> 00:53:05,608
Mrs Carver was found dead

522
00:53:05,697 --> 00:53:09,975
in a hotel suite in that city
in unusual circumstances

523
00:53:10,057 --> 00:53:13,288
on which police have refused
to elaborate.

524
00:53:13,377 --> 00:53:15,174
Oh, Paris!

525
00:53:17,217 --> 00:53:19,333
Her body was discovered

526
00:53:19,417 --> 00:53:22,807
along with the body
of an unidentified man,

527
00:53:22,897 --> 00:53:25,730
the victim
of a self-inflicted gun wound.

528
00:53:27,217 --> 00:53:30,527
I have a clear shot, Mr Bond.

529
00:53:30,617 --> 00:53:32,812
Stand up...slowly.

530
00:53:32,897 --> 00:53:36,810
Drop your gun
und kick it toward me, ja?

531
00:53:41,657 --> 00:53:43,375
Good.

532
00:53:43,457 --> 00:53:46,017
Now lie down on the bed
next to Mrs Carver.

533
00:53:46,097 --> 00:53:49,772
..we extend our deepest
sympathies to Mr Carver.

534
00:53:51,777 --> 00:53:54,211
It will be
on the news in an hour.

535
00:53:54,297 --> 00:53:58,176
- Tomorrow's news today.
- Just so.

536
00:54:04,777 --> 00:54:07,007
My name is Dr Kaufman.

537
00:54:07,097 --> 00:54:10,134
I am an outstanding
pistol marksman.

538
00:54:10,217 --> 00:54:12,447
Take my word for it, ja?

539
00:54:17,417 --> 00:54:19,487
Get the sledgehammers.

540
00:54:31,257 --> 00:54:33,817
She struggled terribly,
Mr Bond.

541
00:54:33,897 --> 00:54:37,253
It's a pity you got her
involved her in this.

542
00:54:38,497 --> 00:54:42,331
It won't look like suicide
if you shoot me from there.

543
00:54:42,417 --> 00:54:45,011
I am a professor
of forensic medicine.

544
00:54:45,097 --> 00:54:47,611
I could shoot you
from Stuttgart,

545
00:54:47,697 --> 00:54:50,086
und still create
the proper effect.

546
00:54:55,697 --> 00:54:57,733
- OW!
- Herr Stamper.

547
00:54:57,817 --> 00:55:02,652
My art is in great demand
all over the world, Mr Bond.

548
00:55:02,737 --> 00:55:06,969
I am especially good
at the celebrity overdose.

549
00:55:08,897 --> 00:55:11,365
Now, I am afraid our little...

550
00:55:13,257 --> 00:55:16,374
Stamper, stop yelling in my ear.

551
00:55:16,457 --> 00:55:18,812
Sir, they can't
get into the car.

552
00:55:18,897 --> 00:55:21,286
You can't be serious.

553
00:55:21,377 --> 00:55:23,937
Did you call the auto club?

554
00:55:24,017 --> 00:55:26,531
Make him tell you
how to open it.

555
00:55:26,617 --> 00:55:28,608
OK, I'll ask.

556
00:55:30,257 --> 00:55:34,694
This is very embarrassing.
There is a red box in your car.

557
00:55:34,777 --> 00:55:39,692
They want me to make you
unlock the car.

558
00:55:39,777 --> 00:55:43,087
I feel like an idiot.
I don't know what to say.

559
00:55:44,617 --> 00:55:47,689
I am to torture you
if you don't do it.

560
00:55:47,777 --> 00:55:50,337
You have a doctorate
in that, too?

561
00:55:50,417 --> 00:55:54,649
No, this is more like a hobby.
But I am very gifted.

562
00:55:54,737 --> 00:55:56,853
Oh, I believe you.

563
00:55:56,937 --> 00:56:00,168
- My cell phone opens the car...
- No, Mr Bond! I do it.

564
00:56:06,166 --> 00:56:08,600
Recall, 3, Send.

565
00:56:19,126 --> 00:56:20,525
Wait.

566
00:56:20,606 --> 00:56:23,404
I'm just a professional
doing a job.

567
00:56:23,486 --> 00:56:25,238
Me too.

568
00:56:53,486 --> 00:56:54,680
Dr Kaufman.

569
00:57:25,027 --> 00:57:28,258
Welcome.
Please fasten seat belt.

570
00:57:34,147 --> 00:57:37,105
Reduce speed.
Pedestrians in roadway.

571
00:58:39,707 --> 00:58:43,097
Obstruction ahead.
Reduce speed now.

572
01:00:01,267 --> 01:00:04,657
Unsafe driving
will void warranty. .

573
01:00:47,107 --> 01:00:50,338
Congratulations
on a safe journey.

574
01:00:55,829 --> 01:00:56,349
U.S. Airbase
South China Sea

575
01:00:56,349 --> 01:00:58,624
U.S. Airbase
South China Sea

576
01:01:14,434 --> 01:01:16,470
Yo, Jimbo!

577
01:01:16,554 --> 01:01:18,510
Wade, what are you doing here?

578
01:01:18,594 --> 01:01:21,427
The world's my office.
This way.

579
01:01:21,514 --> 01:01:26,269
- Did Q bring you up to speed?
- Yeah. I brought the GPS unit.

580
01:01:26,354 --> 01:01:30,950
Officially, Uncle Sam
is neutral in this turkey shoot.

581
01:01:31,034 --> 01:01:32,831
And unofficially?

582
01:01:32,914 --> 01:01:36,384
We don't want World War III -
unless we start it.

583
01:01:36,474 --> 01:01:39,511
Dr Greenwalt is the
air force GPS expert.

584
01:01:39,594 --> 01:01:43,587
The GPS encoder is one of
the most closely guarded secrets

585
01:01:43,674 --> 01:01:45,232
in the U.S. military.

586
01:01:45,314 --> 01:01:47,111
Show him what you got!

587
01:01:50,674 --> 01:01:54,064
The missing encoder!
How did you get that?

588
01:01:54,154 --> 01:01:56,622
Picked it up
in Hamburg yesterday.

589
01:01:56,714 --> 01:02:00,184
Could somebody use this
to send a ship off-course?

590
01:02:00,274 --> 01:02:02,390
Like the Devonshire?

591
01:02:02,474 --> 01:02:04,385
Did anyone mention Devonshire?

592
01:02:04,474 --> 01:02:05,589
- No...
- Good!

593
01:02:05,674 --> 01:02:07,551
So answer
the man's question.

594
01:02:07,634 --> 01:02:11,707
In theory, you could
send a ship off-course.

595
01:02:11,794 --> 01:02:14,831
Like putting a magnet
beside a compass.

596
01:02:14,914 --> 01:02:17,951
- Exactly.
- Then check this out.

597
01:02:29,114 --> 01:02:33,471
Those two circles should
line up on top of each other.

598
01:02:33,554 --> 01:02:36,068
Somebody's tampered with this.

599
01:02:36,154 --> 01:02:40,306
If we knew where
the Devonshire thought she was,

600
01:02:40,394 --> 01:02:42,828
could you figure out
where she sank?

601
01:02:42,914 --> 01:02:44,506
Sure.

602
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:46,073
- Wade.
- Yeah?

603
01:02:46,154 --> 01:02:49,783
I have a small favour to ask.

604
01:02:57,314 --> 01:02:59,782
The high-altitude,
low-opening jump

605
01:02:59,874 --> 01:03:02,263
is where we get
the most fatalities.

606
01:03:02,354 --> 01:03:04,265
For five miles use your oxygen,

607
01:03:04,354 --> 01:03:06,470
or you'll die of asphyxiation.

608
01:03:06,554 --> 01:03:08,067
Like my first marriage.

609
01:03:08,154 --> 01:03:12,705
Pop the chute at 200 feet
below the Chinese radar.

610
01:03:12,794 --> 01:03:15,467
You'll be travelling
over 200 MPH.

611
01:03:15,554 --> 01:03:18,705
Be careful not to crack
your skull open.

612
01:03:18,794 --> 01:03:20,671
I'll keep that in mind.

613
01:03:20,754 --> 01:03:22,870
When you hit the water,

614
01:03:22,954 --> 01:03:25,673
don't forget
to cut away your chute.

615
01:03:25,754 --> 01:03:30,032
90%%% of the people killed
get tangled up and drown.

616
01:03:30,114 --> 01:03:32,708
Seems a lot
to save the world.

617
01:03:32,794 --> 01:03:36,833
I have to prove that ship was
deliberately set off-course.

618
01:03:36,914 --> 01:03:39,030
- One minute!
- The pick-up set?

619
01:03:39,114 --> 01:03:44,507
The extraction team
will pick you up after dark.

620
01:03:45,074 --> 01:03:46,792
Buddha bless.

621
01:03:46,874 --> 01:03:50,389
I just noticed something.

622
01:03:50,474 --> 01:03:52,988
This is where
the ship thought it was.

623
01:03:53,074 --> 01:03:55,349
This is where it really is.

624
01:03:55,434 --> 01:03:58,665
But see that island there?

625
01:03:58,754 --> 01:04:02,190
Where he's jumping is not
technically Chinese waters.

626
01:04:02,274 --> 01:04:04,310
They belong to Vietnam.

627
01:04:04,394 --> 01:04:06,146
- Vietnam?!
- Vietnam?!

628
01:04:06,234 --> 01:04:09,271
He have any U.S. government
markings on him?

629
01:04:09,354 --> 01:04:12,187
The parachute,
the wetsuit, the fins!

630
01:04:12,274 --> 01:04:14,504
Jesus, if the Vietnamese
catch him!

631
01:04:19,714 --> 01:04:21,670
He didn't say good-bye.

632
01:08:29,274 --> 01:08:32,664
Still interested
in hostile take-overs?

633
01:08:32,754 --> 01:08:36,667
It's the opportunities to travel
that I like about banking.

634
01:08:38,743 --> 01:08:39,023
Bring the boat over.

635
01:08:39,023 --> 01:08:40,251
Bring the boat over.

636
01:08:41,303 --> 01:08:42,531
What are you looking for?

637
01:08:53,660 --> 01:08:55,491
Get them out of the water.

638
01:09:10,868 --> 01:09:15,339
If I didn't know better,
I'd say you were following me.

639
01:09:15,428 --> 01:09:20,104
We seem to have developed
an attachment to each other.

640
01:09:21,268 --> 01:09:23,338
Hopefully, not for long.

641
01:09:27,388 --> 01:09:29,504
Another Carver building.

642
01:09:29,588 --> 01:09:32,944
I'd say he's developed
an edifice complex.

643
01:09:51,868 --> 01:09:54,780
- General Chang.
- Friend of yours?

644
01:09:58,108 --> 01:10:00,258
Mr Bond. Miss Lin.

645
01:10:02,308 --> 01:10:03,707
Welcome to Saigon.

646
01:10:03,788 --> 01:10:05,619
Nice to see you, Elliot.

647
01:10:05,708 --> 01:10:10,065
I hadn't intended opening
this centre until tomorrow,

648
01:10:10,148 --> 01:10:12,867
but you can help me write
the inaugural story -

649
01:10:12,948 --> 01:10:14,506
your obituaries.

650
01:10:14,588 --> 01:10:18,467
I hope you extended
the same courtesy to Paris.

651
01:10:18,548 --> 01:10:20,106
Actually, Mr Bond,

652
01:10:20,188 --> 01:10:25,057
you wrote her obituary
when you asked her to betray me.

653
01:10:26,588 --> 01:10:28,067
Still, let's see.

654
01:10:28,148 --> 01:10:31,026
British secret service
agent James Bond

655
01:10:31,108 --> 01:10:33,178
and his collaborator
Wai Lin

656
01:10:33,268 --> 01:10:36,101
of the Chinese
External Security Force

657
01:10:36,188 --> 01:10:37,621
were found...

658
01:10:37,708 --> 01:10:42,020
dead this morning
in Vietnam.

659
01:10:43,428 --> 01:10:47,137
Lacks punch, don't you think?

660
01:10:47,228 --> 01:10:51,016
It's old news. We've been
working together for months.

661
01:10:51,108 --> 01:10:53,906
We know what you
and Chang are up to.

662
01:10:55,508 --> 01:10:57,226
I don't think so.

663
01:10:57,308 --> 01:10:59,902
You may have seen
the general just now,

664
01:10:59,988 --> 01:11:03,139
but perhaps you've
not had chance

665
01:11:03,228 --> 01:11:05,344
to peruse today's headlines.

666
01:11:10,108 --> 01:11:13,703
I like the last one.
It isn't even mine.

667
01:11:13,788 --> 01:11:15,779
I never believe
the press anyway.

668
01:11:15,868 --> 01:11:18,860
Therein lies
your problem, Mr Bond.

669
01:11:18,948 --> 01:11:21,940
We're men of action,
but your era is passing.

670
01:11:22,028 --> 01:11:24,622
Words are the new weapons,

671
01:11:24,708 --> 01:11:27,506
satellites the new artillery.

672
01:11:27,588 --> 01:11:30,660
And you become the new
supreme Allied...commander?

673
01:11:30,748 --> 01:11:32,101
Exactly.

674
01:11:32,188 --> 01:11:34,907
Caesar had his legions,
Napoleon his armies,

675
01:11:34,988 --> 01:11:38,822
I have my divisions -
TV, news, magazines.

676
01:11:38,908 --> 01:11:42,105
And by midnight tonight,
I'll have influenced

677
01:11:42,188 --> 01:11:46,067
more people than anyone
in history save God himself.

678
01:11:46,148 --> 01:11:49,777
And the best he managed
was a sermon on the Mount.

679
01:11:49,868 --> 01:11:51,586
You are insane.

680
01:11:52,908 --> 01:11:55,786
The distance between
insanity and genius

681
01:11:55,868 --> 01:11:57,699
is measured only by success.

682
01:11:57,788 --> 01:12:01,542
- General Chang is waiting.
- If you'll forgive me.

683
01:12:03,212 --> 01:12:03,812
Your appearance has forced me

684
01:12:03,812 --> 01:12:04,881
Your appearance has forced me

685
01:12:04,972 --> 01:12:07,532
to move up
my timetable slightly.

686
01:12:07,612 --> 01:12:10,365
I'll leave you
with Mr Stamper and his toys.

687
01:12:10,452 --> 01:12:12,010
Perhaps you'd like to see them.

688
01:12:12,092 --> 01:12:14,526
Sir, the helicopter.

689
01:12:14,612 --> 01:12:18,844
Mr Stamper is a protege
of the late Dr Kaufman,

690
01:12:18,932 --> 01:12:23,642
who was schooling him in the
ancient art of chakra torture.

691
01:12:23,732 --> 01:12:28,248
- He was like a father to me.
- Interesting role model.

692
01:12:28,332 --> 01:12:30,971
The body has seven
chakra points -

693
01:12:31,052 --> 01:12:34,124
energy centres -
like the heart or genitals.

694
01:12:34,212 --> 01:12:37,443
These implements
probe those organs,

695
01:12:37,532 --> 01:12:39,568
inflicting maximum pain

696
01:12:39,652 --> 01:12:42,689
whilst keeping the victim alive
as long as possible.

697
01:12:42,772 --> 01:12:45,889
Dr Kaufman's record
was 52 hours.

698
01:12:45,972 --> 01:12:47,928
I'm hoping to break it.

699
01:12:48,012 --> 01:12:51,402
Watching your TV shows
is torture enough.

700
01:12:52,372 --> 01:12:54,249
Save this one till last.

701
01:12:54,332 --> 01:12:57,244
When you remove Mr Bond's heart,

702
01:12:57,332 --> 01:13:02,201
there should be enough time for
him to watch it stop beating.

703
01:13:38,364 --> 01:13:40,878
We can use the banner.

704
01:13:43,844 --> 01:13:47,678
- Hope it holds.
- Get after them!

705
01:13:47,764 --> 01:13:49,720
- Ready?
- Go!

706
01:14:09,364 --> 01:14:11,832
Oh, sheesh.

707
01:14:13,004 --> 01:14:15,359
Next time,
I'll take the elevator.

708
01:14:40,556 --> 01:14:42,626
Get a car!

709
01:14:42,716 --> 01:14:44,672
No! A bike is quicker.

710
01:14:46,356 --> 01:14:49,348
Keys. Someone
always forgets them.

711
01:14:49,436 --> 01:14:53,395
I'm driving. Get off!
Get on the back.

712
01:14:56,316 --> 01:14:57,908
I'm slipping.

713
01:15:00,676 --> 01:15:02,712
Stop fidgeting!

714
01:15:04,556 --> 01:15:07,753
- What are you...
- Give me that!

715
01:15:07,836 --> 01:15:09,792
Clutch, clutch, clutch!

716
01:15:09,876 --> 01:15:11,514
- Right.
- No, left.

717
01:15:11,596 --> 01:15:13,314
Who's driving?

718
01:15:43,876 --> 01:15:45,434
Clutch!

719
01:15:50,036 --> 01:15:52,106
Left! Left!

720
01:15:55,236 --> 01:15:58,706
- How many back there?
- I can't see. Hold on.

721
01:16:01,436 --> 01:16:03,028
What are you...

722
01:16:05,076 --> 01:16:08,307
- Don't get any ideas.
- I'd never dream of it.

723
01:16:09,356 --> 01:16:10,948
One. No, two.

724
01:16:17,396 --> 01:16:19,227
Go for the barrels.

725
01:16:22,356 --> 01:16:23,835
Very good.

726
01:16:43,396 --> 01:16:44,875
Hold on!

727
01:16:52,196 --> 01:16:54,346
Let's take the highway.

728
01:17:13,596 --> 01:17:16,156
- Helicopter!
- Keep your shirt on.

729
01:17:59,796 --> 01:18:04,153
- Get on the back.
- Are you trying to protect me?

730
01:18:04,236 --> 01:18:06,545
No, I need to balance
the bike.

731
01:18:14,916 --> 01:18:17,350
You ready? Go!

732
01:18:29,996 --> 01:18:32,146
Pop the clutch.

733
01:18:59,996 --> 01:19:02,146
It's behind us.

734
01:19:05,756 --> 01:19:07,986
Get out of the way!

735
01:19:16,196 --> 01:19:17,311
Get down!

736
01:19:25,196 --> 01:19:26,993
Get down!

737
01:19:37,276 --> 01:19:42,191
- You see the chopper?
- I can't see. Hold on.

738
01:20:01,276 --> 01:20:02,186
Trapped.

739
01:20:04,916 --> 01:20:06,110
Never.

740
01:20:51,676 --> 01:20:54,509
Would you pass the soap?

741
01:20:56,636 --> 01:20:58,388
Over there.

742
01:21:01,276 --> 01:21:04,427
You were pretty good
with that hook.

743
01:21:04,516 --> 01:21:07,349
I grew up in
a rough neighbourhood.

744
01:21:07,436 --> 01:21:10,109
You were pretty good
on the bike.

745
01:21:10,196 --> 01:21:13,586
Well, I didn't grow up at all.

746
01:21:13,676 --> 01:21:15,951
Here. Allow me.

747
01:21:16,956 --> 01:21:19,675
Don't get any ideas, Mr Bond.

748
01:21:19,756 --> 01:21:23,385
Just off the cuff,
I thought we might link up.

749
01:21:23,476 --> 01:21:25,706
Walk hand in hand?

750
01:21:25,796 --> 01:21:29,027
Stick closely to each other.

751
01:21:29,116 --> 01:21:32,904
Maybe we'll go after
General Chang together.

752
01:21:32,996 --> 01:21:35,954
Thanks for washing my hair.

753
01:21:37,156 --> 01:21:39,147
I work alone.

754
01:24:03,756 --> 01:24:06,111
Lucky for you I stopped by.

755
01:24:06,196 --> 01:24:09,074
I could've taken care of him.

756
01:24:10,076 --> 01:24:12,590
Hmm, but you didn't.

757
01:24:12,676 --> 01:24:14,632
Give me the earring.

758
01:24:15,956 --> 01:24:20,234
Copy of a macro-59.
Standard issue, Chinese Army.

759
01:24:20,316 --> 01:24:23,308
Looks like General Chang
wants you dead.

760
01:24:23,396 --> 01:24:25,466
Still think you can
do this alone?

761
01:24:25,556 --> 01:24:28,866
Is your mission
peace or revenge?

762
01:24:28,956 --> 01:24:31,265
This is about stopping a war.

763
01:24:36,596 --> 01:24:39,030
Last year, Stealth
material went missing

764
01:24:39,116 --> 01:24:41,266
from one of Chang's bases.

765
01:24:41,356 --> 01:24:43,711
I followed a lead
to Carver in Hamburg.

766
01:24:43,796 --> 01:24:45,309
Stealth material?

767
01:24:45,396 --> 01:24:48,991
We thought he was
building a Stealth plane.

768
01:24:49,076 --> 01:24:50,907
No. Stealth boat.

769
01:24:50,996 --> 01:24:53,829
That's how they got
close to the Devonshire,

770
01:24:53,916 --> 01:24:56,794
to drill inside
the missile room.

771
01:24:56,876 --> 01:24:59,310
They stole a Cruise missile.

772
01:24:59,396 --> 01:25:02,149
He's moving
the timetable to midnight.

773
01:25:02,236 --> 01:25:06,434
He'll position the Stealth boat
near the British fleet

774
01:25:06,516 --> 01:25:09,588
and fire the missile into China.

775
01:25:09,676 --> 01:25:12,110
And we will retaliate.

776
01:25:12,196 --> 01:25:14,551
And Carver
provides the pictures.

777
01:25:14,636 --> 01:25:17,150
- I have to warn Beijing.
- No.

778
01:25:17,236 --> 01:25:20,069
Let's get our governments
talking. We'll find the boat.

779
01:25:21,356 --> 01:25:21,956
Stand up.

780
01:25:21,956 --> 01:25:23,355
Stand up.

781
01:25:42,836 --> 01:25:44,349
Just like home.

782
01:25:44,436 --> 01:25:47,428
You get the equipment,
I'll send the messages.

783
01:25:52,036 --> 01:25:55,187
On second thoughts, you type.

784
01:25:55,276 --> 01:25:58,313
First we have to find the boat.

785
01:25:58,396 --> 01:26:02,514
Of all the harbours
and inlets controlled by Chang,

786
01:26:02,596 --> 01:26:06,271
22 are in highly
populated areas.

787
01:26:06,356 --> 01:26:08,870
That leaves 14
to hide the boat in.

788
01:26:08,956 --> 01:26:13,029
It's invisible to radar
but not the human eye.

789
01:26:15,196 --> 01:26:17,346
Very novel.

790
01:26:17,436 --> 01:26:22,590
He'd have to sail to the
Devonshire and back in a night.

791
01:26:24,236 --> 01:26:27,308
- This looks familiar.
- We made some improvements.

792
01:26:27,396 --> 01:26:29,148
Did you, indeed?

793
01:26:29,236 --> 01:26:33,275
OK, 4 hours out
and 4 hours back.

794
01:26:33,356 --> 01:26:37,190
Assume the boat is
travelling at 30 knots.

795
01:26:39,396 --> 01:26:42,388
I'm a fan
of Chinese technology.

796
01:26:43,476 --> 01:26:47,788
There are four places
where he could harbour the boat.

797
01:26:47,876 --> 01:26:49,628
On your left.

798
01:26:52,556 --> 01:26:54,626
Check those areas.

799
01:27:00,716 --> 01:27:03,310
Ah, a new Walther.

800
01:27:03,396 --> 01:27:05,387
I asked Q to get me one.

801
01:27:17,196 --> 01:27:20,074
I've got it. Look.

802
01:27:20,156 --> 01:27:23,114
Four missing boats,
three unexplained drownings.

803
01:27:26,508 --> 01:27:28,499
Ha Long Bay.

804
01:27:43,948 --> 01:27:46,587
He knows the island.

805
01:27:46,668 --> 01:27:50,263
He says it's dangerous
for boats there at sunset.

806
01:27:50,348 --> 01:27:53,306
But for $5,000, he'll take us.

807
01:27:53,388 --> 01:27:55,185
Good.

808
01:27:56,068 --> 01:27:58,138
Maybe he'll take a cheque.

809
01:28:11,068 --> 01:28:13,866
It's mostly dull routine,

810
01:28:13,948 --> 01:28:16,064
but every now and then,

811
01:28:16,148 --> 01:28:20,221
you get to work
with a decadent agent

812
01:28:20,308 --> 01:28:22,697
of a corrupt Western power.

813
01:28:22,788 --> 01:28:25,222
And they say Communists
can't have fun.

814
01:28:25,308 --> 01:28:27,344
I hate to disappoint you,

815
01:28:27,428 --> 01:28:30,386
but I don't even have
a little red book.

816
01:28:32,308 --> 01:28:34,902
If anything happens to me,

817
01:28:34,988 --> 01:28:38,060
the fuses for the mines
are in here.

818
01:28:40,548 --> 01:28:43,108
We're gonna
finish this together.

819
01:28:43,188 --> 01:28:46,021
And if I may say so,

820
01:28:46,108 --> 01:28:51,262
you've found the right decadent
Western agent as a partner.

821
01:29:08,508 --> 01:29:10,817
See the Stealth?

822
01:29:10,908 --> 01:29:12,546
No.

823
01:29:12,628 --> 01:29:16,143
It's getting late
and this is the last cove.

824
01:29:23,028 --> 01:29:25,496
Yeah, that's it.

825
01:29:52,468 --> 01:29:55,585
Set your timers for 10 minutes.

826
01:29:55,668 --> 01:29:58,546
Time to get out
before it explodes.

827
01:29:58,628 --> 01:30:02,382
If it doesn't sink,
our fleets will finish it.

828
01:30:02,468 --> 01:30:04,663
If they got our message.

829
01:30:04,748 --> 01:30:06,784
OK, you, up and over.

830
01:30:21,377 --> 01:30:21,977
We're in position
between the fleets.

831
01:30:21,977 --> 01:30:24,013
We're in position
between the fleets.

832
01:30:24,097 --> 01:30:27,806
Fire one missile
at each flagship.

833
01:30:27,897 --> 01:30:31,810
The Chinese will think the
British are rattling the sabre.

834
01:30:31,897 --> 01:30:35,606
The British will think the
Chinese are being belligerent.

835
01:30:35,697 --> 01:30:39,656
And the media will provide
cool, objective coverage.

836
01:30:39,737 --> 01:30:43,047
Let the mayhem begin.

837
01:30:49,774 --> 01:30:50,054
TMS Bedford. British Fleet.

838
01:30:50,054 --> 01:30:51,487
TMS Bedford. British Fleet.

839
01:30:53,163 --> 01:30:53,723
- Missile lock-on.
- Signal to Admiralty.

840
01:30:53,723 --> 01:30:55,918
- Missile lock-on.
- Signal to Admiralty.

841
01:30:56,003 --> 01:30:58,563
"Task crew
under missile attack."

842
01:31:00,323 --> 01:31:03,235
Two waves of land-based
MiG-21s inbound.

843
01:31:03,323 --> 01:31:06,042
Should be on our screens
in 2 minutes.

844
01:31:06,123 --> 01:31:09,559
How long before the MiGs
are within firing range?

845
01:31:09,643 --> 01:31:11,281
12 minutes.

846
01:31:11,363 --> 01:31:14,400
What the hell do I pay you for?

847
01:31:18,043 --> 01:31:22,275
If she's there, Bond is there.
Stamper, find them!

848
01:31:28,043 --> 01:31:31,592
Wai Lin, Wai Lin, camera!

849
01:31:38,803 --> 01:31:41,363
If she blinks, kill her.

850
01:31:41,443 --> 01:31:43,195
You, come with me.

851
01:32:27,283 --> 01:32:30,480
Stamper to bridge.
Bond is dead.

852
01:32:30,563 --> 01:32:32,155
Delicious.

853
01:32:32,243 --> 01:32:35,121
Bring the girl up to me.

854
01:32:39,803 --> 01:32:42,397
Are you sure
you want her up here?

855
01:32:42,483 --> 01:32:46,795
It's my business, Mr Gupta.
I like an audience.

856
01:32:52,683 --> 01:32:54,958
Ah, Ms Lin.

857
01:32:55,043 --> 01:33:00,071
Your countrymen are so
predictably eager to save face.

858
01:33:00,163 --> 01:33:03,314
They know you are here.
They're looking for you.

859
01:33:03,403 --> 01:33:06,076
Not according to our radar.

860
01:33:06,163 --> 01:33:10,361
It seems your MiGs will attack
the British fleet in...?

861
01:33:10,443 --> 01:33:13,321
Nine minutes to firing range.

862
01:33:13,403 --> 01:33:16,679
Even if they were
looking for me,

863
01:33:16,763 --> 01:33:20,642
they can't see me
on a Stealth boat.

864
01:33:20,723 --> 01:33:26,514
Or you. Or your friend,
the late Commander Bond,

865
01:33:26,603 --> 01:33:31,313
who is on his way to the bottom
of the South China Sea.

866
01:33:31,403 --> 01:33:33,041
He's my new anchorman.

867
01:33:45,043 --> 01:33:46,476
Pathetic.

868
01:33:50,003 --> 01:33:52,722
What on earth's going on?

869
01:33:52,803 --> 01:33:57,513
A message from 007, confirmed
by my opposite number in China.

870
01:33:57,603 --> 01:34:02,199
Search for a ship that's
almost invisible to radar.

871
01:34:02,283 --> 01:34:04,638
The Chinese aren't the enemy.

872
01:34:04,723 --> 01:34:07,954
Carver's been playing
both sides for fools.

873
01:34:11,763 --> 01:34:16,314
- Message from the Admiralty.
- Look at this.

874
01:34:16,403 --> 01:34:20,316
Is there anything on the radar
that looks very small?

875
01:34:20,403 --> 01:34:21,995
- Lifeboat, periscope?
- No, sir.

876
01:34:22,083 --> 01:34:23,641
A Stealth boat -
they've gone mad.

877
01:34:31,608 --> 01:34:33,917
What you're about
to witness, Ms Lin,

878
01:34:34,008 --> 01:34:36,806
is not so much
a missile attack

879
01:34:36,888 --> 01:34:38,799
but the launch
of a new world order.

880
01:34:38,888 --> 01:34:42,927
In 5 minutes, once your
countrymen attack the British,

881
01:34:43,008 --> 01:34:46,239
I shall retaliate
for dear old England

882
01:34:46,328 --> 01:34:49,320
by sending this missile
into Beijing,

883
01:34:49,408 --> 01:34:51,842
where General Chang
has just called

884
01:34:51,928 --> 01:34:54,840
an emergency meeting
of the Chinese high command.

885
01:34:54,928 --> 01:34:56,043
Unfortunately...

886
01:34:56,128 --> 01:34:58,722
General Chang...

887
01:34:58,808 --> 01:35:00,878
will be delayed in traffic,

888
01:35:00,968 --> 01:35:05,564
arriving just after the missile
has killed your leaders.

889
01:35:05,648 --> 01:35:08,640
Too late to stop
the air force from sinking

890
01:35:08,728 --> 01:35:11,447
the entire British fleet.

891
01:35:11,528 --> 01:35:13,837
But he will be just in time
to take over the government,

892
01:35:13,928 --> 01:35:15,486
negotiate a truce,

893
01:35:15,568 --> 01:35:18,162
and emerge as a world leader

894
01:35:18,248 --> 01:35:20,682
with the Nobel Peace Prize.

895
01:35:20,768 --> 01:35:22,884
- And what do you get?
- Me?

896
01:35:22,968 --> 01:35:24,526
Oh...

897
01:35:24,608 --> 01:35:26,838
nothing.

898
01:35:26,928 --> 01:35:31,001
Just exclusive broadcasting
rights in China for 100 years.

899
01:35:33,288 --> 01:35:36,166
Ready to rock and ruin.

900
01:35:36,248 --> 01:35:39,604
Excuse me, my dear.
I have a deadline to meet.

901
01:35:39,688 --> 01:35:41,087
Prepare for
the missile launch.

902
01:35:44,728 --> 01:35:45,922
Mr Gupta.

903
01:35:46,008 --> 01:35:47,441
Hello, Elliot.

904
01:35:47,528 --> 01:35:50,520
Interesting plan.

905
01:35:50,608 --> 01:35:52,564
I have something here
that belongs to you.

906
01:35:52,648 --> 01:35:54,718
So much for German efficiency.

907
01:35:54,808 --> 01:35:56,036
Mr Stamper.

908
01:36:04,928 --> 01:36:05,997
Don't shoot him yet.

909
01:36:06,088 --> 01:36:07,203
Hold your fire.

910
01:36:07,288 --> 01:36:11,406
Welcome to my world crisis,
Mr Bond.

911
01:36:11,488 --> 01:36:13,126
Even trade, Elliot.

912
01:36:13,208 --> 01:36:17,565
Gupta for Wai Lin. You can't
fire the missile without him.

913
01:36:17,648 --> 01:36:21,118
And it seems you can't resist
any woman in my possession.

914
01:36:21,208 --> 01:36:23,597
What are you waiting for?
Shoot him!

915
01:36:23,688 --> 01:36:27,681
I told you. We're gonna
finish this together.

916
01:36:27,768 --> 01:36:29,645
How romantic.

917
01:36:29,728 --> 01:36:33,641
Do you realise
how absurd your position is?

918
01:36:33,728 --> 01:36:36,322
No more absurd than starting
a war for ratings.

919
01:36:36,408 --> 01:36:41,163
Great men manipulate the media
to save the world.

920
01:36:41,248 --> 01:36:42,647
Look at William
Randolph Hearst,

921
01:36:42,728 --> 01:36:45,845
who told his photographers,
"You provide the pictures,

922
01:36:45,928 --> 01:36:47,759
and I'll provide the war."

923
01:36:47,848 --> 01:36:49,884
I'm just taking it
one step further.

924
01:36:53,728 --> 01:36:58,199
Sorry about that. I, er...tuned
out there for a moment, Elliot.

925
01:36:58,288 --> 01:36:59,960
Touche.

926
01:37:00,968 --> 01:37:02,117
Mr Gupta,

927
01:37:02,208 --> 01:37:03,402
is the missile ready to fire?

928
01:37:03,488 --> 01:37:06,286
Press the magic button,
Beijing disappears.

929
01:37:06,368 --> 01:37:09,644
Then it seems you've
outlived your contract.

930
01:37:12,688 --> 01:37:15,521
You see, Mr Bond,
I have a back-up plan.

931
01:37:15,608 --> 01:37:17,246
Uh-huh, so do I.

932
01:37:41,088 --> 01:37:43,238
He's breached the hull.
They'll see us on radar.

933
01:37:43,328 --> 01:37:46,798
Sir, we have a small
intermittent contact

934
01:37:46,888 --> 01:37:49,607
on the surface plot,
bearing 1-1-2 degrees.

935
01:37:49,688 --> 01:37:53,806
Can't get the range, but
it wasn't there a second ago.

936
01:37:53,888 --> 01:37:56,561
Tell all ships
do not fire on the Chinese

937
01:37:56,648 --> 01:37:57,717
for any reason whatsoever.

938
01:37:57,808 --> 01:38:01,881
Send a message to the Chinese:
"Have sighted unknown ship..."

939
01:38:01,968 --> 01:38:04,687
Get those fires out!

940
01:38:04,768 --> 01:38:06,759
Go and protect the missile.

941
01:38:06,848 --> 01:38:07,997
Oh, and, Mr Stamper,

942
01:38:08,088 --> 01:38:11,125
would you please kill
those bastards?!

943
01:38:27,298 --> 01:38:28,936
Nice work.

944
01:38:31,058 --> 01:38:35,529
- They're speeding up.
- We have to stop the boat.

945
01:38:35,618 --> 01:38:39,770
Take care of the engine room
and get off the ship.

946
01:38:39,858 --> 01:38:41,814
I'll stop the missile.

947
01:38:52,708 --> 01:38:56,417
Captain, a signal from
the Chinese fleet commander.

948
01:38:56,508 --> 01:38:57,657
To Royal Navy task group.

949
01:38:57,748 --> 01:39:01,184
We also have
the unknown ship on our screens.

950
01:39:01,268 --> 01:39:04,226
We will not fire unless
it turns towards China.

951
01:39:04,308 --> 01:39:06,026
Until then she's yours.

952
01:39:06,108 --> 01:39:09,259
Captain, whatever the hell
that thing is, sink it.

953
01:39:09,348 --> 01:39:12,658
Right, sir. Is that echo
too weak for missile lock?

954
01:39:12,748 --> 01:39:14,022
Yes, sir.

955
01:39:14,108 --> 01:39:17,100
Right. We'll do it
the old-fashioned way.

956
01:39:22,852 --> 01:39:23,452
Bond turned us into the target.

957
01:39:23,452 --> 01:39:25,283
Bond turned us into the target.

958
01:39:25,372 --> 01:39:27,249
Along with himself.

959
01:39:27,332 --> 01:39:29,243
Take evasive action.

960
01:39:29,332 --> 01:39:31,926
Prepare the missile
countdown immediately.

961
01:39:32,012 --> 01:39:33,445
Initialising launch sequence.

962
01:39:33,532 --> 01:39:36,569
T minus 5 minutes
and counting.

963
01:39:36,652 --> 01:39:40,008
T minus 5 minutes and counting.

964
01:39:40,092 --> 01:39:42,128
Sir, they're making 48 knots.

965
01:39:42,212 --> 01:39:44,646
They'll be out of visual range
within 2 minutes.

966
01:39:44,732 --> 01:39:46,723
Keep firing. Slow them down.

967
01:40:46,532 --> 01:40:49,842
The engines are out.
We're sitting ducks here.

968
01:41:29,132 --> 01:41:30,326
Follow me!

969
01:42:16,052 --> 01:42:19,806
T minus 4 minutes and counting.

970
01:42:21,892 --> 01:42:23,086
OK.

971
01:43:02,252 --> 01:43:04,447
Well done. Officer watch,
increase max.

972
01:43:04,532 --> 01:43:06,250
Keep firing!

973
01:43:08,452 --> 01:43:11,683
All hands, abandon ship.
Abandon ship.

974
01:43:11,772 --> 01:43:15,048
Abandon ship. Abandon ship.

975
01:43:33,092 --> 01:43:38,212
Mr Stamper, what are you
doing about the girl?

976
01:43:38,292 --> 01:43:41,443
Perhaps you'd consider
looking in the engine room.

977
01:43:44,172 --> 01:43:48,211
T minus 3 minutes and counting.

978
01:44:38,737 --> 01:44:41,490
You're too late again,
Mr Bond.

979
01:44:42,417 --> 01:44:45,853
It's a bad habit of yours.
There's nothing you can do.

980
01:44:54,417 --> 01:44:58,126
T minus 2 minutes and counting.

981
01:44:58,217 --> 01:45:02,415
The missile's fully programmed.
It can't restart.

982
01:45:02,497 --> 01:45:05,295
In a matter of minutes,
my plan will succeed.

983
01:45:05,377 --> 01:45:08,369
And thanks largely
to your efforts,

984
01:45:08,457 --> 01:45:10,732
the British Navy
will destroy the evidence.

985
01:45:10,817 --> 01:45:12,250
And I'll be out of here

986
01:45:12,337 --> 01:45:15,647
in a Carver news helicopter
covering the event.

987
01:45:15,737 --> 01:45:18,854
It's going to be
a fantastic show!

988
01:45:18,937 --> 01:45:21,770
I may have some
breaking news for you.

989
01:45:27,257 --> 01:45:30,932
You forgot the first rule
of mass media!

990
01:45:32,937 --> 01:45:35,167
Give the people what they want!

991
01:45:49,297 --> 01:45:51,936
T minus one minute and counting.

992
01:46:05,617 --> 01:46:07,289
Drop it, Mr Bond...

993
01:46:07,377 --> 01:46:08,810
or I'll drop your friend.

994
01:46:10,017 --> 01:46:12,167
It's over, Stamper.

995
01:46:12,257 --> 01:46:13,815
Let her go.

996
01:46:13,897 --> 01:46:15,330
Not between you and me.

997
01:46:16,817 --> 01:46:19,456
James, try to detonate it.

998
01:46:19,537 --> 01:46:20,811
The missile will set them off.

999
01:46:20,897 --> 01:46:23,809
Never argue with a woman.
They're always right.

1000
01:46:38,057 --> 01:46:40,173
T minus 40 seconds.

1001
01:46:47,137 --> 01:46:48,650
For Carver!

1002
01:46:51,177 --> 01:46:53,247
And Kaufman!

1003
01:47:02,537 --> 01:47:05,609
I owe you an unpleasant
death, Mr Bond.

1004
01:47:29,137 --> 01:47:30,650
Nein!

1005
01:47:47,497 --> 01:47:50,250
T minus 20 seconds.

1006
01:47:53,217 --> 01:47:56,015
We die together, Mr Bond.

1007
01:48:08,897 --> 01:48:11,730
T minus 10 seconds.

1008
01:48:33,337 --> 01:48:35,009
Two...

1009
01:48:35,097 --> 01:48:35,688
One...

1010
01:49:26,697 --> 01:49:30,246
M, Bedford reports that Carver
went down with his ship.

1011
01:49:30,337 --> 01:49:32,293
It seems that Bond made it.

1012
01:49:34,017 --> 01:49:35,450
Moneypenny, take this release.

1013
01:49:35,537 --> 01:49:38,051
Elliot Carver is missing,
presumed drowned

1014
01:49:38,137 --> 01:49:41,174
while on a cruise
aboard his luxury yacht

1015
01:49:41,257 --> 01:49:43,134
in the South China Sea.

1016
01:49:43,217 --> 01:49:46,812
At present, the local
authorities believe

1017
01:49:46,897 --> 01:49:49,172
the media mogul
committed suicide.

1018
01:49:58,497 --> 01:50:00,852
Commander Bond,

1019
01:50:00,937 --> 01:50:03,497
Colonel Lin,

1020
01:50:03,577 --> 01:50:05,932
this is the HMS Bedford.

1021
01:50:07,617 --> 01:50:09,050
Are you there?

1022
01:50:10,937 --> 01:50:13,895
They're looking for us, James.

1023
01:50:15,777 --> 01:50:18,814
Let's stay undercover.
