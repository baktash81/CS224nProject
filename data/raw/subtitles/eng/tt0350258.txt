1
00:01:48,074 --> 00:01:50,201
Always remember
your promise to me.

2
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:53,439
Never let nobody or nothing
turn you into no cripple.

3
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:16,461
All right!

4
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:18,094
Rest stop, 45 minutes.

5
00:02:18,238 --> 00:02:20,468
Come on, folks.
We gotta move.

6
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,800
We leave at 2:45 p. m.
on the dot. Can't be late.

7
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:27,041
Hot meals
and bathrooms inside.

8
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:29,872
All right, uh, there's a
window out back

9
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:31,314
for y'all to buy sandwiches.

10
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:33,909
And I suggest you make
good use of them outhouses.

11
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:36,387
Ain't nothing but bushes
for you in the Carolinas.

12
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:37,718
Sir.

13
00:02:40,226 --> 00:02:41,693
Can I help you, sir?

14
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:42,853
Yes, sir.

15
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,392
Seattle?

16
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:48,028
Who you riding with?

17
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:49,693
Nobody. Just me.

18
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:52,361
Boy, I can't take
responsibility

19
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:55,305
for some blind nigger
traveling 3,500 miles alone.

20
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:57,570
I- I-I paid for this here
ticket, and it says

21
00:02:57,644 --> 00:02:59,669
that you have to take me
to Seattle.

22
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:02,371
Don't you be smarting off
to me, boy.

23
00:03:03,249 --> 00:03:05,513
With all due respect, sir,
I earned the right.

24
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:07,485
I may have left my eyes
on Omaha Beach,

25
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:09,647
but I ain't asking no charity
from Uncle Sam.

26
00:03:09,722 --> 00:03:11,986
I got a job waiting
for me in Seattle.

27
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:14,654
You were in Normandy?

28
00:03:14,727 --> 00:03:17,025
Shuttling troopers
to the beach.

29
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:19,294
We took a direct hit.

30
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:25,769
I'm sorry, son.

31
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,599
I'll keep an eye on you
myself.

32
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:32,008
Come on.
Take a seat in the back.

33
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:42,217
Any time

34
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:46,255
You're feeling lonely

35
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:49,293
Anytime

36
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:51,626
You're feeling blue

37
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:55,929
Anytime

38
00:03:56,135 --> 00:03:59,161
Anytime you feel
down hearted

39
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:04,772
That will prove
your love for me is true

40
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:09,407
Anytime

41
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:12,812
You're thinkin' about me

42
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,353
Til, what the hell
do you think you're doin'?

43
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:20,415
Billy, don't get
your feathers all ruffled now.

44
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:23,223
I met this ol' boy over
at the O.C. at Clarkfield,

45
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:24,888
and well, he plays
a mean jazz piano.

46
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:27,262
I don't care if he whistles
Dixie out his ass.

47
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,301
He ain't gonna
do it here.

48
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:30,700
Sir.

49
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,700
Boy, are you blind?

50
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:34,399
Yes, sir.
Since I was seven.

51
00:04:36,175 --> 00:04:37,870
Well, let me help you
out then.

52
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:40,071
This is a country band.

53
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:42,443
We don't play
no boogie-woogie.

54
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:45,081
Uh, yes, I understand.
I love country music.

55
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:47,676
All right, go on.
Tell me.

56
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:50,222
What is it you love
about country music?

57
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,587
I- I love the stories.

58
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:53,216
Uh, you know,
about fallin' in love

59
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,954
and having love
knock you around

60
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:57,019
and then the pressures
of the world on you so tough.

61
00:04:57,096 --> 00:04:58,324
It-It makes you
feel small.

62
00:04:58,398 --> 00:04:59,831
You want to give
your soul to God.

63
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:01,867
You might as well.
Your ass belongs to Him.

64
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,444
Boy, are you sure
you blind?

65
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:13,911
Last time I checked.

66
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,460
Okay. Come on in.

67
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:45,042
Billy,
I think you're outvoted.

68
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:47,505
Til, one hint of trouble,

69
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,377
and your blind nigra's
out of here.

70
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,342
Damn!

71
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:54,077
Here.

72
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,711
I'm gonna have
to put some glasses

73
00:05:56,789 --> 00:05:59,417
before he scares
somebody half to death.

74
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,965
Seattle, Washington, folks.

75
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,028
Change bus here
for all points north:

76
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:14,733
Bellingham, Mount Vernon.

77
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:16,468
Vancouver, Canada.

78
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:37,358
Uh, that's Diz. Emanon.

79
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:40,197
Yeah. But what's it
spell backwards?

80
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:41,528
Ah-ah-ah, come on, man.

81
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:43,831
Why don't you give me
something difficult?

82
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,165
"No Name. "

83
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,732
Say, daddy-o,
what ax you play?

84
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:49,775
Uh, piano.

85
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:51,207
Just blew in
from Tampa, Florida.

86
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:53,142
Me and my partner,
Gossie McGee, came here,

87
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:54,839
you know, want to
fatten up our style.

88
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:57,212
Cop some licks from some more
experienced cats. You dig?

89
00:06:57,283 --> 00:06:58,477
You know what?

90
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:00,143
Why don't you let me
take you inside?

91
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:01,345
You know,
show you around.

92
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:02,979
All right. Perfect gentleman. Yeah.

93
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:04,522
This is just
like my place.

94
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,784
So, what's your name?

95
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:06,916
Ray Robinson.

96
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:08,051
I'm Quincy Jones.

97
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:09,116
Quincy Jones.

98
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:11,493
Hey, Gerry!
This here's my man, Ray.

99
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:13,327
He's here to see his friend,
Gossie McGee.

100
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:14,889
So I figured
I'll show him inside-

101
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:17,162
Don't mess with me, Q.
He can come in, but not you.

102
00:07:17,236 --> 00:07:19,670
Vice is on my ass for letting
you underage kids in.

103
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:20,899
Get out of here, Q.

104
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:22,440
Can't you see-
Get out of here, Q.

105
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:24,305
He's blind! I gotta
show him in. Get out.

106
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:26,174
Jive-ass.
What?

107
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:28,975
Hey, Ray Robinson, when am
I gonna hear you play, baby?

108
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:30,675
Uh, well,
that may cost you.

109
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:36,218
Welcome, all you cool cats
and fine felines.

110
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:39,224
You've come to the place where
the sophisti-cats and hipsters

111
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,157
hang their bebop hats.

112
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:43,522
So snuggle up
and come near

113
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:47,157
for tonight is Talent Night
at The Rocking Chair.

114
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,626
Let's hear it
for Dancin' Al!

115
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:03,579
Gossie's been cattin' around with one
of my waitresses since he got here.

116
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:06,777
He never told me that his
partner was a blind 'Bama boy.

117
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:09,284
Marlene,
Demurs just called.

118
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:11,255
Thurmond's sick.

119
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,753
What about Sassy?

120
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,019
Flat tire.

121
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:25,061
Okay, 'Bama. Why don't you get on
up there and show me what you got?

122
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:28,139
Well, I-I'm not prepared to
do my thing right now, tonight-

123
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:30,368
This is the only audition
you're going to get, puddin'.

124
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:34,004
So either get on up there, or you and
Gossie can haul your asses back down South.

125
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,014
Here. Smoke some of this.

126
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,580
This ain't no tobacco, man.

127
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:43,519
No, hold it in,
it'll calm you down.

128
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:44,954
All right, Oberon.

129
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,491
Get on up there
and introduce him.

130
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:47,958
Yes, ma'am.

131
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:50,794
Okay, 'Bama. Let's go.

132
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:53,325
Yeah.

133
00:08:55,902 --> 00:09:00,202
Now, I got something special
for all you satin dolls.

134
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:03,002
And I don't mean
Oberon's big thunder.

135
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,905
Now that's
for another show.

136
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:08,208
Now we got some
new blood for ya.

137
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:10,408
Yeah, straight off
the bus from Florida,

138
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:15,318
I give you Ray "Don't
Call Me Sugar" Robinson!

139
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,027
How y'all doing tonight?

140
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:27,326
Better than you!

141
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:31,564
Relax, Ray. Relax.

142
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:32,797
I got it.

143
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:38,641
Uh-uh, what do y'all
want to hear?

144
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:44,548
How about
a little Nat King Cole?

145
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:52,957
Y'all like Nat King Cole?

146
00:09:55,995 --> 00:10:00,261
If you ever plan
to travel west

147
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:03,196
'Bama ain't bad.

148
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,032
Yeah, I'd say
he saved our asses.

149
00:10:07,506 --> 00:10:09,337
What the hell is
Ray doin' up there?

150
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:11,306
Auditioning for you,
Gossie.

151
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:13,845
He ain't no good without me.

152
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,815
How'd you and the 'Bama like
to do a week here at the Chair?

153
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:19,282
I know a good bass player.

154
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:22,651
A nice jazz trio could score
big with the right manager.

155
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:24,716
Manager?

156
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:27,450
Come on now, Gossie,
don't be so small-minded.

157
00:10:27,526 --> 00:10:29,084
You know
you've got to give to get.

158
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:31,152
Now what exactly do I
have to give?

159
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,595
25 percent.

160
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:34,189
But I'll be gettin' you
other gigs.

161
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:37,167
All right,
next question: What do I get?

162
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,201
What do you need?

163
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:42,172
Double scale as leader,
plus 10 percent.

164
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:44,839
What about the 'Bama?

165
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:47,401
He's about as green
as a blade of grass.

166
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:49,509
I can handle him.

167
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:51,209
Flagstaff, Arizona

168
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:52,911
Yeah, he's green.

169
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,452
Kingman, Barstow

170
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,283
So, Gossie,
you don't need to worry

171
00:10:56,355 --> 00:10:57,879
about a hotel room
for the 'Bama.

172
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:59,953
He can flop at my place.

173
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:02,620
Hey, y'all never change.

174
00:11:02,695 --> 00:11:06,688
Get your kicks
on Route sixty-six

175
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:12,199
Ray, you coming back to bed?

176
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:15,138
I'm getting some water.

177
00:11:15,207 --> 00:11:18,108
I can see that,
but mama ain't finished yet.

178
00:11:18,744 --> 00:11:20,541
For the first time anywhere,

179
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:23,582
let's hear it
for The McSon Trio!

180
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:26,277
A buzzard took the monkey
for a ride in the air

181
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:29,446
The monkey thought that
everything was on the square

182
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:30,989
Ray, when you
coming out?

183
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:32,319
In a minute.

184
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:36,259
Mama's got some more blackberry
cobbler for you, baby.

185
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:38,022
Damn.

186
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:42,131
Straighten up
and fly right

187
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,726
Cool down, papa,
don't you blow your top

188
00:11:53,813 --> 00:11:55,872
Marlene, if you're gonna
send us out on tour,

189
00:11:55,948 --> 00:11:57,540
we're gonna need
more than $5 a day.

190
00:11:57,616 --> 00:11:59,675
How come we can't get paid
after each gig?

191
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:01,913
Because you boys will spend
everything you make.

192
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:04,888
The club sends the checks
to me, so as I can bank them.

193
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:07,357
I just want to see
my own checks, that's all.

194
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:10,293
You don't see, Ray.
You're blind, baby.

195
00:12:10,362 --> 00:12:12,057
Or did you forget?

196
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:16,156
Now, you want to go out on your
own and see how well you do?

197
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,940
Ray! Hey, Marlene,
where's Ray?

198
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:29,947
He's in the back bedroom.
And wipe your feet.

199
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:39,614
Ray, uh, six-nine, where
you at? Six-nine. Six-nine.

200
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:43,293
Lionel Hampton just asked me
to go on the road with him, man!

201
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:44,920
Lionel Hampton, man!

202
00:12:44,997 --> 00:12:46,828
Sure he did.
Then why you still here?

203
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:50,858
And dig this: His wife, she
kicked me off the tour bus.

204
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:53,769
Told me to come back when I
started shaving. You believe that?

205
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,967
Uh-uh, Seven-oh, could you do me a
favor, man, and close that bag for me?

206
00:12:57,042 --> 00:12:59,374
What's wrong? You got two
hands. You can close it yourself.

207
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,208
I got two feet, too.
Could you close it?

208
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,872
I got it.

209
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:06,477
Excuse me, sir!

210
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,081
Man, we're gonna be late.

211
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:12,855
I got to get
my own place, Gossie.

212
00:13:13,492 --> 00:13:16,825
Why? I mean,
you got free rent right now.

213
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:18,997
Like hell it's free rent.

214
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:24,363
Oh, come on, Ray.

215
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:26,336
Why you gonna mess
with a good thing?

216
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:28,703
All I'm saying is you keep
layin' that pipe with Marlene,

217
00:13:28,774 --> 00:13:30,708
and I bet you she's gonna
make us all rich.

218
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:32,607
Hey, sir, excuse me!

219
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:40,709
Straighten up
and fly right

220
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,850
Straighten up
and stay right

221
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,488
Straighten up
and fly right

222
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:47,753
Cool down, papa

223
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:52,696
Don't you blow your top

224
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:01,763
Just back from their
triumphant tour

225
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:05,242
of the Yakima Valley,
The McSon Trio!

226
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:06,901
They'll be back right here,

227
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:09,243
same time, same place,
next week.

228
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:17,051
Hey, baby, you sound more
like Nat than the King himself.

229
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:20,016
What's your name?

230
00:14:20,092 --> 00:14:21,116
Ray Robinson.

231
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:22,487
Ray Robinson?

232
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:25,086
I'm Jack Lauderdale,
Swing Time Records.

233
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:28,099
Oh, hey-hey, hey, Jack!
How you doing, man?

234
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:29,361
Good.
Oh, good.

235
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:31,062
How about us makin'
a record together?

236
00:14:31,136 --> 00:14:33,195
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Hell, yeah! Let's do that.

237
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:34,466
Can I help you?

238
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,564
I don't think so.

239
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:37,939
We're just talking
a little business.

240
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:41,173
Then you need to talk to me,
'cause I'm his manager.

241
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,979
Whichever way
the wind blows.

242
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,174
It's blowing.

243
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,808
Jack Lauderdale,
Swing Time Records.

244
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,750
Marlene Andres.
Marlene?

245
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,310
Gossie McGee.
Gossie McGee.

246
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:50,582
Great set, baby.

247
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:52,624
We're going to talk
with Mr. Lauderdale here.

248
00:14:52,691 --> 00:14:54,022
Come on, Jack.
I'm buying.

249
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:55,526
I'm coming in, uh,
to talk to him.

250
00:14:55,594 --> 00:14:57,653
You are doing
a fabulous job!

251
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:58,754
Yes, man.

252
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:00,822
Eh, look, let's talk to him
about this record.

253
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,993
Hey, no, no, we're gonna
let Marlene handle that.

254
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:05,002
You get Oberon
to call you a cab, all right.

255
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,628
Great set, Ray.

256
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,934
Goss!

257
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:11,101
Hey, daddy-o, want a smoke?

258
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:13,645
I got some gage,
fresh off the boat.

259
00:15:13,712 --> 00:15:15,179
It's clean and seedless.

260
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:17,010
So that's how it is, huh?

261
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:20,014
You keep me high
while they talk the business?

262
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:22,818
I ain't the one
playing you, man.

263
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:24,821
Oberon, listen...

264
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:29,959
You know, Marlene and Gossie are the
ones running the game on you, Ray.

265
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:31,087
What?

266
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:33,688
They sliced up the pie
the first night you played.

267
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,495
35 percent off the top.

268
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:37,592
Plus Gossie's
double scale as leader.

269
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:39,299
Leader?
If anybody's leading the band,

270
00:15:39,371 --> 00:15:41,566
I'm the one
that's the leader.

271
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:43,398
Forget the bo' humps.
You know what?

272
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:44,840
I- I'm-I'm gonna go
my own way.

273
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,775
Who's gonna
book your gigs?

274
00:15:46,912 --> 00:15:48,812
Marlene's got you locked up.

275
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:51,679
And she ain't gonna give up
her golden goose.

276
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:54,480
Straighten up
and fly right

277
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:57,078
Cool down, papa,
don't you blow your top

278
00:15:57,156 --> 00:15:59,351
Hey, Ray Robinson,
you are fantastic.

279
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:02,557
There you go.
Give me some skin.

280
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:05,255
What's that?

281
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:06,491
Jack's card.

282
00:16:06,598 --> 00:16:08,691
I got his number
at the hotel.

283
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:16,474
Come on, Q.
It's not that complicated.

284
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:17,873
Now let's just play it again.

285
00:16:17,943 --> 00:16:19,774
That's a B flat,
C 7, scale it up,

286
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:21,779
and triple it off
the back end.

287
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,244
Yeah, nigger!
Yeah, that's it.

288
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:30,846
Ray, what did I tell you
about cookin' in the dark?

289
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:32,584
Are you tryin'
to burn the house down?

290
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:35,183
Think about it, Marlene. Uh-uh,
What do I need the light for?

291
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:37,023
Well, you don't need
to be cookin' anyway.

292
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:38,654
We brought you
takeout from Oscar's.

293
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:39,789
Well, get your money back.

294
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:41,230
I got fried chicken
right here.

295
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,597
Come on, Seven-oh,
try this.

296
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,158
Yeah! About time.

297
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,836
Hey, that's home-cooked,
right there.

298
00:16:47,906 --> 00:16:49,066
Mmm, no, thank you.

299
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:50,540
This chicken
is the mostest, huh.

300
00:16:50,609 --> 00:16:52,873
Just needs a little hot sauce
and it'll be perfect.

301
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:54,970
Yeah. So, what did
Jack Lauderdale have to say?

302
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:56,639
Oh, I clocked him
comin' out the gate.

303
00:16:56,715 --> 00:16:57,977
He's a two-bit hustler.

304
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:59,210
Oh, I see.

305
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:01,809
Yeah, turns out the only hit
that Swing Time ever had

306
00:17:01,887 --> 00:17:04,082
was Open the Door, Richard,
which was a joke record.

307
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:06,021
Uh-uh-uh, what about him
recordin' me?

308
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:08,457
Oh, he'll record you,
if we pay the freight.

309
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:10,254
Scratch a liar,
find a thief.

310
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:12,887
What's that
supposed to mean?

311
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:14,159
This.

312
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,800
You see I saw
Jack Lauderdale tonight,

313
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,894
and he gave me a $500
advance on my record.

314
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:21,235
He also said he'll put me
on the road with Lowell Fulson

315
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:22,830
and pay me three times
what you pay.

316
00:17:22,908 --> 00:17:24,034
Now, that's a lie!

317
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:27,545
Hey, no way he's not gonna put some
blind man on the road. Think about it.

318
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:29,547
I mean, you-you need
watchin' out for.

319
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:31,845
And he ain't got the time to
look after you the way I do.

320
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:34,351
Is that what you've been doing,
Gossie? Watchin' out for me?

321
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,285
Is that why you get
paid double what I do?

322
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:38,983
Who told you that?

323
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,116
It's true, ain't it?

324
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:42,183
You two have been
gaming me since I got here.

325
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:44,229
Ray, baby, listen-
I ain't listening to you!

326
00:17:44,296 --> 00:17:46,696
Ray, I've-I've been meaning
to talk to you about that.

327
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:48,824
Then why aren't you talkin'?

328
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:53,433
Um, look, Ray, Ray,
let's not do nothin' stupid.

329
00:17:53,505 --> 00:17:55,268
I might be blind,
but I ain't stupid!

330
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,035
Q., get my bag
from upstairs.

331
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:58,235
What?
Get it!

332
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,800
Wha- right now?
Now.

333
00:17:59,878 --> 00:18:02,108
Ray, man, we done been
through a whole lot.

334
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:04,911
Ray, now wait a minute.
I can explain everything.

335
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:06,912
Think about what you're doing.

336
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:08,850
Ray, Ray, now you're makin'
a big mistake.

337
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,912
That clown is spoutin'
promises that he can't keep.

338
00:18:10,989 --> 00:18:12,752
You'd be a fool
to follow him.

339
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:14,156
Ray, Ray,
we'll make a new deal!

340
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:15,352
Whatever makes you happy!

341
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,361
The deal is
you can lay the pipe now.

342
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:20,865
You'll break your neck going down
these stairs by yourself. Hang on.

343
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,358
Oh, man.

344
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:26,200
Ray, I ain't never seen you do
nothing like that, man. Never.

345
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:27,966
That ain't nothing,
Seven-oh.

346
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,784
Stop cheating, Ray.

347
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:46,250
George, you can't catch me.
Come on.

348
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:47,656
Aretha!

349
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:49,690
Come on, George.

350
00:18:49,761 --> 00:18:52,252
Aretha Robinson,
have you lost your mind?

351
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:55,630
Eula, you promised to split every
wash basket with me, fair and square!

352
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:56,793
And I did!

353
00:18:56,869 --> 00:18:57,961
Hell, you did!

354
00:18:58,036 --> 00:19:00,129
You charge white folks
one thing and pay me another.

355
00:19:00,205 --> 00:19:01,638
Now who's gonna
wash these?

356
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:03,197
You can.
Now pay me my money!

357
00:19:06,778 --> 00:19:08,769
Okay, I'm a-giving you
your two little dollars.

358
00:19:08,847 --> 00:19:10,974
But don't you be expectin'
no more work out of me!

359
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:12,482
I got all I need
out of you.

360
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:14,051
Ray and George, come on!

361
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:15,746
That's right.
Get out of my yard

362
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,584
and don't y'all
never come back!

363
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:23,256
Y'all got to learn
to read and write real good,

364
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:26,092
so you never have to work
for people like that.

365
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,860
Scratch a liar,
find a thief.

366
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:28,900
Understand?

367
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:30,127
Yes, Mama.

368
00:19:43,081 --> 00:19:45,743
Smell that, Ray.
Smell the success.

369
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,417
We're in LA, man,

370
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:49,784
the place where the Negro
comes to spread his wings.

371
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:52,255
You-you know, man, I know
my ears ain't deceivin' me.

372
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:53,348
Is that Art Tatum?

373
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:55,086
It sure is, baby.
You want to meet him?

374
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,822
I- I can't meet him.
A- Art Tatum is the most.

375
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:07,528
So, Ray, we got to talk about
your name, man: Robinson.

376
00:20:07,606 --> 00:20:10,507
Sugar Ray got the Robinson
franchise all sewed up.

377
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:14,239
So I'm thinkin' we go with
your middle name, Charles.

378
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,179
As in, Ray Charles.

379
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:17,977
I don't care
what you call me, man,

380
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,847
just as long as my name's
on the record.

381
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:21,317
But we're gonna
toast to that.

382
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:22,683
Hey, what's the haps, Jack?

383
00:20:22,754 --> 00:20:24,381
Oh, my goodness.
Give me some skin.

384
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:26,515
What's up, baby?
How you doin'?

385
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:30,187
Lowell Fulson, meet your new
piano player: Ray Charles.

386
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:32,822
Ray Charles,
the blind sensation.

387
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:36,698
Ow! Damn! I'm gonna use that
on the album cover.

388
00:20:36,768 --> 00:20:38,201
He's really
the sensation.

389
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:40,101
I- I love your music,
Mr. Fulson.

390
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:41,571
Uh, the man's got taste.

391
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,938
Hey, and the man ain't
been on the road

392
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:46,239
with a band before,
so now you take care of him.

393
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:47,676
Like my own brother.

394
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,512
Ray.

395
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:54,511
I'm gonna be right back.

396
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:55,644
All right.

397
00:20:56,154 --> 00:20:58,782
Yeah, you got the one
on the left.

398
00:20:58,857 --> 00:21:00,620
Look here,
let me do the talking.

399
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:30,978
Don't go inside that place.

400
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:32,489
You know what Mama said.

401
00:21:32,557 --> 00:21:35,025
Go home
and don't tell Mama nothin'.

402
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,925
Go, George.

403
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,231
George, get out of here!

404
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:11,827
Hey, boy,
who let you in?

405
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:14,191
You must be
Aretha's son, huh?

406
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:16,496
Yes, sir.
Ray Charles Robinson.

407
00:22:16,968 --> 00:22:19,698
I've been seeing you
sneakin' around here.

408
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:21,733
You like the piano, huh?

409
00:22:22,307 --> 00:22:24,332
Come on, you want
to learn how to play?

410
00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:25,706
Come on over here.

411
00:22:25,777 --> 00:22:27,506
Let me show you how to play.
Come on.

412
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:29,809
I'm gonna teach you
how to play.

413
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:32,816
What we'll do, I'm gonna teach
you three notes, right?

414
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:34,977
This is the first note,
right here.

415
00:22:36,555 --> 00:22:37,647
Play that.

416
00:22:38,924 --> 00:22:41,154
And here's the second note,
right here.

417
00:22:42,327 --> 00:22:43,555
Play that.

418
00:22:45,263 --> 00:22:46,924
Here's the third note.

419
00:22:49,968 --> 00:22:51,265
Now, here's the way
it goes.

420
00:22:51,336 --> 00:22:52,928
Listen.
Listen closely, now.

421
00:22:56,675 --> 00:22:58,006
Play that.

422
00:22:59,578 --> 00:23:00,909
Good!

423
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,843
Try the other notes.

424
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:14,158
Every club we hit,

425
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:16,694
it's your responsibility
to rehearse the band.

426
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:18,820
These are some
lazy-ass bastards,

427
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:21,195
so you gotta make sure
that they don't slough off.

428
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,727
You gotta be ready
and dressed to open the show.

429
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:26,168
Now, Lowell likes to take
a nap before he goes on.

430
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:29,298
You just do your thing until
he feels like comin' out.

431
00:23:29,374 --> 00:23:32,275
And when Lowell's playin',
you keep the band sharp.

432
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:33,333
Uh-uh, just one thing.

433
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:34,344
What?

434
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:37,007
Did Jack tell you that
I have to be paid in singles?

435
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:39,482
You just do your job,
you're gonna get your money.

436
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:42,451
Baby, come on, down

437
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:45,684
Your daddy's
in the heart of town

438
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:50,918
Come on down

439
00:23:50,996 --> 00:23:54,454
Your daddy's
in the heart of town

440
00:24:00,705 --> 00:24:03,037
How'd you get the name
Fathead anyway?

441
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:04,598
Why do they call me
Fathead?

442
00:24:04,743 --> 00:24:06,267
Nah, you don't want to hear.

443
00:24:06,344 --> 00:24:08,335
But this is what
I really want to know.

444
00:24:08,413 --> 00:24:10,472
Do any of you
fine young ladies know

445
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:12,915
where we can get a nice steak
this time of night?

446
00:24:12,984 --> 00:24:16,010
You mean something big,
thick, and juicy?

447
00:24:16,087 --> 00:24:17,884
Oh, yeah,
that's just what I mean.

448
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:21,388
Fathead, where you guys
headed, man?

449
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,053
I ain't babysittin'
no blind cat.

450
00:24:25,063 --> 00:24:26,462
Uh, I'm sorry, Ray,

451
00:24:26,531 --> 00:24:29,261
but, uh, the law says
there's only six to a cab.

452
00:24:29,334 --> 00:24:31,359
Come on, ladies,
let's get out of here.

453
00:25:28,093 --> 00:25:30,288
Everyday

454
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:39,130
Everyday I have the blues

455
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:48,977
Everyday, everyday

456
00:25:53,285 --> 00:25:55,583
Pay up, baby!
Yeah, that's all right.

457
00:25:55,654 --> 00:25:57,918
I been shootin' craps
since I was 12 years old.

458
00:25:57,989 --> 00:26:00,549
Don't never shoot craps
on a white woman's grave.

459
00:26:00,625 --> 00:26:01,614
Why not?

460
00:26:01,693 --> 00:26:02,751
It's bad luck.

461
00:26:02,827 --> 00:26:06,228
You know bad luck
and trouble, people

462
00:26:09,601 --> 00:26:12,263
Well, you know
I had my share

463
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:20,272
That's for being
late to the bus.

464
00:26:20,345 --> 00:26:21,835
Wilbur,
you a low-down piece-

465
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:23,380
You better move on.

466
00:26:28,853 --> 00:26:31,014
Ah, Mr. One-dollar Bill.

467
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:35,720
$5, $10, $15, $20-

468
00:26:36,828 --> 00:26:39,490
Now, you like to start
counting that again?

469
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:42,530
All right, damn you.

470
00:26:44,869 --> 00:26:47,030
$284, $285...

471
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:49,938
Listen, man, I ain't
no damn seein'- eye dog.

472
00:26:50,008 --> 00:26:53,444
You know
ain't nobody worried about me

473
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:59,712
I don't see nobody,
nobody cryin'

474
00:27:06,691 --> 00:27:09,159
Fathead, open up. Open up.
I got to take a leak.

475
00:27:12,163 --> 00:27:14,961
Hey, what you doing, man?
Close the door, Fat!

476
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,498
Say, Ray, we'll be in here
for a little while.

477
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:20,367
Use the women's can,
down there on your right.

478
00:27:20,438 --> 00:27:21,996
I don't want to use
the women's can.

479
00:27:22,073 --> 00:27:23,097
This way.

480
00:27:42,894 --> 00:27:44,225
Oh, God!

481
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:47,028
Say, Ray,
you all right?

482
00:27:48,199 --> 00:27:49,928
Yeah, I must have slipped
on the wet.

483
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:51,093
There's a pipe broke.

484
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:52,727
There's water everywhere.
You see it?

485
00:27:52,804 --> 00:27:54,704
Let's go, man.
Close the door.

486
00:27:54,773 --> 00:27:56,172
All right,
quit playing, Ray.

487
00:27:56,241 --> 00:27:58,732
We'll be in here a while.
Now go on now!

488
00:28:06,451 --> 00:28:07,475
Where you from, Ray?

489
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:08,780
North Florida.

490
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:10,677
Oh, North Florida boy.

491
00:28:11,222 --> 00:28:12,382
Your people
still down there?

492
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:13,684
No.

493
00:28:14,893 --> 00:28:16,019
All right.

494
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,052
Hey, uh, pardon me
for askin',

495
00:28:18,129 --> 00:28:20,029
but how do you
get around so good

496
00:28:20,098 --> 00:28:21,998
without a cane
or a dog?

497
00:28:22,767 --> 00:28:25,668
How do you get around so good
without a cane or dog?

498
00:28:26,271 --> 00:28:27,863
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to pry.

499
00:28:29,941 --> 00:28:32,034
My ears got to be
my eyes, man. Its-

500
00:28:32,844 --> 00:28:34,106
Everything sounds different.

501
00:28:34,179 --> 00:28:36,238
You know that's why
I wear hard-soled shoes,

502
00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:38,305
so I can hear my footsteps
echo off the wall.

503
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:41,614
So when I pass by an open
doorway, the sound changes.

504
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,119
Wow. That's cool.

505
00:28:43,588 --> 00:28:47,183
You know you got to learn pretty quick
if you want to get around on your own.

506
00:28:47,258 --> 00:28:48,384
Yeah.

507
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:51,291
You know, during the war,
there was a whole lot

508
00:28:51,362 --> 00:28:53,557
I had to learn fast,
or I wouldn't be here.

509
00:28:56,134 --> 00:28:58,534
Seein' that much death
ain't natural.

510
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:02,737
Yeah, seein' death
ain't natural.

511
00:29:07,212 --> 00:29:09,203
Boys, get from
'round that still.

512
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,679
Y'all know
better than that.

513
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:12,182
Come on, catch me.

514
00:29:17,522 --> 00:29:19,717
Stay from 'round this fire
and get clean.

515
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:21,383
Dinner will be ready soon.

516
00:29:21,459 --> 00:29:22,949
Hear me, Ray?

517
00:29:24,729 --> 00:29:25,991
I got you.
I got you.

518
00:29:26,064 --> 00:29:27,429
No, you didn't.
You missed me.

519
00:29:27,499 --> 00:29:28,796
Stop cheatin', Ray.

520
00:29:28,867 --> 00:29:31,495
Okay, you got me.

521
00:29:31,569 --> 00:29:33,298
But I got you back.

522
00:29:33,371 --> 00:29:35,100
I'm not playin' no more.

523
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:36,534
Sissy!

524
00:29:38,243 --> 00:29:40,609
Come on, Ray.
Let's go swimmin'.

525
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:45,306
Let's go swim
in Mama's washtub.

526
00:29:46,317 --> 00:29:48,444
Ray, come on, Ray,
play with me.

527
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,813
You better get down
before Mama sees you.

528
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:52,356
I'm a giant!

529
00:29:56,494 --> 00:29:57,961
Some giant.

530
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:01,828
Come on, George.
I ain't playin' this game.

531
00:30:02,867 --> 00:30:04,391
That ain't funny.

532
00:30:06,337 --> 00:30:08,999
Boys, I got some field peas
and rice cooking.

533
00:30:09,073 --> 00:30:11,667
And there's that smothered
corn left from yesterday.

534
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:15,736
And if you're real good, I might
have two pieces of peach cobbler.

535
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:19,177
Ray, didn't I tell you
to get in this house?

536
00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:24,179
Dear God, no!

537
00:30:28,927 --> 00:30:30,121
That's Aretha's boy!

538
00:30:30,261 --> 00:30:31,592
Breathe, baby, breathe.

539
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:35,064
Just breathe, baby, breathe.
Let it out!

540
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:36,930
Let it out, please!

541
00:30:37,068 --> 00:30:38,433
Breathe for your mama, now.

542
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:39,834
Come on, George.

543
00:30:40,071 --> 00:30:42,198
Why didn't you do somethin'?

544
00:30:42,707 --> 00:30:44,140
Why didn't you call me?

545
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:47,371
Help us, Lord!

546
00:30:47,445 --> 00:30:49,072
The Lord done took him home.

547
00:30:58,690 --> 00:30:59,918
All right.

548
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:02,755
Food and piss stop.
Open it up.

549
00:31:06,064 --> 00:31:08,760
The food is hot.
You've got 45 minutes.

550
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,225
I could eat a horse.
Where's it?

551
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:13,394
Follow your nose.
Right over there.

552
00:31:14,105 --> 00:31:15,231
Wilbur.

553
00:31:15,306 --> 00:31:16,364
What?

554
00:31:16,441 --> 00:31:18,739
45 minutes
ain't enough time.

555
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:20,300
We need more
than that, Jack.

556
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:21,970
Not to eat,
you don't.

557
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:24,139
Now if you got other business,
you better choose,

558
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:25,739
because this bus
is rollin' on time.

559
00:31:25,817 --> 00:31:29,048
Come on, Mercedes got
a washroom in the back.

560
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:31,947
And you,
you can smell it.

561
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:34,649
Jeff.

562
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:35,715
Yes, sir?

563
00:31:35,793 --> 00:31:37,055
Uh, could you help me
in there?

564
00:31:37,128 --> 00:31:38,527
Sure thing, Ray.

565
00:31:38,596 --> 00:31:39,620
Hey, Mercedes.

566
00:31:39,697 --> 00:31:42,495
Hey, baby. I hope you wiped your
feet before you came in here.

567
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:44,000
There you go. Come on.
Take that.

568
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:45,933
The bathroom's right there
in front of you.

569
00:31:46,004 --> 00:31:46,971
Okay.

570
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:48,300
You want me
to fix you a plate?

571
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:49,670
Uh, no, I'm-I'm fine.

572
00:31:49,974 --> 00:31:51,134
All right.

573
00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:53,074
Sweet potato pie it is.

574
00:31:54,512 --> 00:31:55,638
Whoo, let's go, man.

575
00:31:55,713 --> 00:31:57,476
That was a long
bus ride, wasn't it?

576
00:31:57,548 --> 00:31:58,640
Oh, come on, man.

577
00:31:58,716 --> 00:32:01,810
Hey, man!
The can's down the hall.

578
00:32:01,886 --> 00:32:03,751
I know where the can is.
What y'all doing?

579
00:32:03,821 --> 00:32:05,448
Do yourself a favor
and leave.

580
00:32:05,523 --> 00:32:07,388
I'll leave when
I'm gettin' ready to leave.

581
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:08,982
Come on, Fathead,
I want in.

582
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,755
This ain't no weed, Ray.

583
00:32:10,895 --> 00:32:12,829
And we ain't
snorting no bitch.

584
00:32:12,897 --> 00:32:14,125
This is boy.

585
00:32:14,198 --> 00:32:16,666
Boy'll make your ass
null and void.

586
00:32:16,734 --> 00:32:18,326
So get on out of here, man.

587
00:32:18,403 --> 00:32:20,234
Null and void,
just like my life.

588
00:32:20,305 --> 00:32:21,932
I'll be right at home.

589
00:32:22,006 --> 00:32:23,701
Look, I ain't gonna
wait all night.

590
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:25,469
Hell, it's his funeral, man.

591
00:32:27,545 --> 00:32:29,570
Ray, let's go get
something to eat.

592
00:32:29,647 --> 00:32:31,239
I'll leave
when I get a taste.

593
00:32:31,316 --> 00:32:32,510
Ray, what you gonna do, man?

594
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:34,016
This train's pullin' out,
brother.

595
00:32:34,085 --> 00:32:35,916
I ain't having nothin'
to do with this.

596
00:32:35,987 --> 00:32:37,682
I warned you, Ray.
Come on, man.

597
00:32:37,755 --> 00:32:38,949
I been warned.

598
00:32:39,023 --> 00:32:40,285
Sit down, Ray. Right there.

599
00:32:40,358 --> 00:32:41,882
I'm gonna take you
on a little ride.

600
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,622
It'll cost you, though.
You got some cash?

601
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:46,129
Will this do?

602
00:32:46,898 --> 00:32:47,887
That'll do.

603
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:51,999
Where you been?
Where them other fools?

604
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:53,537
Come on,
get it while it's hot!

605
00:32:54,906 --> 00:32:57,238
You're going to feel
a little pinch.

606
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:01,503
I ain't givin'
up on you, boy.

607
00:33:02,947 --> 00:33:04,471
Feel it, baby?

608
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,447
Just take the ride.

609
00:33:08,586 --> 00:33:10,417
It's better than sex.

610
00:33:10,788 --> 00:33:13,120
There ain't nothin'
better than sex.

611
00:33:18,563 --> 00:33:20,656
We will walk

612
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:25,669
through the streets
of the city

613
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:27,897
Of the city

614
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:32,198
Where our loved ones

615
00:33:32,276 --> 00:33:37,213
have gone on before

616
00:33:39,884 --> 00:33:44,548
We will stand on the banks

617
00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:48,522
of the river

618
00:33:48,626 --> 00:33:50,526
Of the river

619
00:33:50,895 --> 00:33:53,887
Where we'll meet

620
00:33:54,065 --> 00:33:59,002
to part no more

621
00:34:02,306 --> 00:34:05,600
I pray

622
00:34:05,676 --> 00:34:08,338
Be free from now on

623
00:34:08,446 --> 00:34:10,937
Pray to you, Lord

624
00:34:11,015 --> 00:34:15,918
Where our true ones
have gone

625
00:34:16,621 --> 00:34:21,324
Gone before

626
00:34:22,026 --> 00:34:26,588
We will stand on the banks

627
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:30,698
of the river

628
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:35,432
Where we'll meet

629
00:34:35,506 --> 00:34:40,136
to part no more

630
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:13,400
Ray, come on, let me put this
salve on I got from Dr. McLeod.

631
00:35:13,478 --> 00:35:15,002
No, I don't like it.
It stings.

632
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:16,546
Boy, get up here.

633
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:20,016
I paid a whole dollar for it.
It better work.

634
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:22,586
Now hold up your head,
like the doctor says.

635
00:35:22,653 --> 00:35:24,621
This is gonna
make you feel better.

636
00:35:29,026 --> 00:35:31,221
Ray, come on in
for dinner.

637
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:33,593
And stop rubbin' those eyes.

638
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:47,568
Ray, I won't beat around
the bush with you.

639
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:48,907
You're goin' blind.

640
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:52,347
The doctor's sayin' there's nothing they
can do, so we got to do it ourselves.

641
00:35:52,416 --> 00:35:53,474
Yes, ma'am, I know, but-

642
00:35:53,551 --> 00:35:54,518
Stop it.

643
00:35:54,585 --> 00:35:56,143
Stop it right now.

644
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:58,154
We ain't got no time
for no tears.

645
00:35:58,222 --> 00:35:59,883
Ain't nobody gonna
have no pity on you

646
00:35:59,957 --> 00:36:01,254
just 'cause
you're goin' blind.

647
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:02,485
Now wipe them eyes.

648
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,959
Yes, ma'am.

649
00:36:05,963 --> 00:36:08,261
Okay, I'll show you
how to do something once.

650
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:09,959
I'll help you
if you mess up twice.

651
00:36:10,034 --> 00:36:11,729
But the third time,
you're on your own,

652
00:36:11,802 --> 00:36:14,168
'cause that's the way
it is in the world.

653
00:36:14,238 --> 00:36:15,728
All right,
now get up.

654
00:36:17,575 --> 00:36:20,806
Remember, you goin' blind,
but you ain't stupid.

655
00:36:22,914 --> 00:36:24,472
Remember how many stairs
there were?

656
00:36:24,549 --> 00:36:25,880
Four.

657
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:29,442
Good. You're gonna have to
learn how to use your memory.

658
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,680
Now turn around.

659
00:36:30,755 --> 00:36:32,689
I want you
to hold out your hands,

660
00:36:32,757 --> 00:36:35,692
and use them as your eyes,
and find the door.

661
00:36:36,894 --> 00:36:39,920
Good.
That's real good, baby.

662
00:36:50,241 --> 00:36:51,230
Hi.

663
00:36:58,082 --> 00:37:01,813
Baby,
let me hold your hand

664
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:09,823
Till I make you understand

665
00:37:11,696 --> 00:37:13,960
Oh, baby

666
00:37:17,535 --> 00:37:20,561
Let me hold your hand

667
00:37:28,212 --> 00:37:30,840
I really true believe

668
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:34,578
This fool makes one record, and
you'd think he's the star of the band.

669
00:37:34,652 --> 00:37:37,485
Well, he's got somethin',
ain't he?

670
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:39,954
His wax won't
even hit the charts.

671
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:42,490
You're still the man.

672
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:46,461
I want you to know

673
00:37:48,733 --> 00:37:50,030
I'm in love

674
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:51,090
She wasn't that fine.

675
00:37:51,168 --> 00:37:52,567
There's somethin'
wrong with you.

676
00:37:52,637 --> 00:37:55,970
No, man, she's fine. She's
fine. You leave her alone.

677
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:57,507
Look at Ray.

678
00:37:58,442 --> 00:37:59,568
You see that?

679
00:37:59,644 --> 00:38:01,305
He feels her wrist
'cause he figures

680
00:38:01,379 --> 00:38:03,677
that's the way to tell
if she's good-looking or not.

681
00:38:03,748 --> 00:38:06,182
You know I had my eye on you
all night long.

682
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:08,241
Oh, he right this time.

683
00:38:10,221 --> 00:38:13,190
See what a little fame does
to Null and Void?

684
00:38:13,557 --> 00:38:16,720
Anybody see that fine-looking
gal in the yellow dress?

685
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:19,422
You hear this man?

686
00:38:19,497 --> 00:38:20,987
You snooze, you lose.

687
00:38:21,065 --> 00:38:22,794
We gonna dock your pay, man.

688
00:38:22,867 --> 00:38:24,801
That's $2 off of your busride.

689
00:38:29,607 --> 00:38:33,099
Baby,
I want you by my side

690
00:38:36,013 --> 00:38:37,275
I do

691
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:43,579
I want you to know

692
00:38:45,856 --> 00:38:49,348
Our love
we will never hide

693
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:52,959
Oh, no, no, no

694
00:38:54,765 --> 00:38:56,426
All right, who's next?

695
00:38:57,401 --> 00:38:58,834
It's a shame, Jimmy.

696
00:38:58,903 --> 00:39:00,894
You're just gonna
piss this right up your arm.

697
00:39:00,971 --> 00:39:03,531
You don't tell me
what to do with my money.

698
00:39:03,908 --> 00:39:07,537
All right, come on. Step up.
The $1 sensation.

699
00:39:12,783 --> 00:39:14,580
You wanna keep counting?

700
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:16,381
What's the matter with you,
boy?

701
00:39:16,454 --> 00:39:17,853
$50 ain't good enough for you?

702
00:39:17,922 --> 00:39:20,015
That ain't $50. Keep counting.

703
00:39:20,591 --> 00:39:23,924
I guess you want charity, since
that record of yours ain't selling.

704
00:39:26,997 --> 00:39:28,464
Get him off my back!

705
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:34,931
Break it up!

706
00:39:35,072 --> 00:39:36,733
What the hell's
going on in here?

707
00:39:37,274 --> 00:39:40,141
The blind sensation don't like
the money I'm trying to pay him!

708
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:41,269
He's cheating me! I quit!

709
00:39:41,345 --> 00:39:43,006
Oh, you lying son of a bitch!

710
00:39:43,314 --> 00:39:45,407
Don't be fighting nobody
that can see!

711
00:39:45,483 --> 00:39:48,213
Listen, I ain't runnnin' around
lookin' for singles for this chump!

712
00:39:48,285 --> 00:39:49,377
There's $50 here, Ray.

713
00:39:49,453 --> 00:39:50,442
You see that, fool?

714
00:39:50,521 --> 00:39:53,354
Shut up, Wilbur! Ray, from now
on, I'll handle your pay myself.

715
00:39:53,424 --> 00:39:54,413
I'm tired of this!

716
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:56,221
I'll tell Jack to
find you somebody else!

717
00:39:56,293 --> 00:39:57,521
You sure?
It's cold out there.

718
00:39:57,595 --> 00:39:59,620
Don't worry about me,
I can take care of myself.

719
00:39:59,697 --> 00:40:01,858
Ray!
Damn it, Wilbur!

720
00:40:01,932 --> 00:40:02,956
Let him go!

721
00:40:03,033 --> 00:40:04,523
What we gonna do now?

722
00:40:12,343 --> 00:40:16,040
"After the death of Moses, the
Lord spake unto Joshua saying:

723
00:40:16,113 --> 00:40:18,513
"'Moses my servant is dead.

724
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:21,050
"'Now therefore arise.
Go over to Jordan.

725
00:40:21,118 --> 00:40:22,244
"'Be not afraid,

726
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:24,412
for the Lord thy God
is with thee. "'

727
00:40:24,488 --> 00:40:25,955
Mr. Charles.

728
00:40:26,457 --> 00:40:27,822
Who is it?

729
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:29,586
Mr. Charles,
my name is Ahmet Ertegun.

730
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:31,252
May I have
a moment of your time?

731
00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:36,899
What do you want, man?
I'm at church.

732
00:40:36,967 --> 00:40:39,265
I'm sorry.
I'll come back later.

733
00:40:39,403 --> 00:40:41,462
You're here now.
What do you want?

734
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,867
My company, Atlantic Records,
has acquired

735
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:47,103
your contract
from Swing Time.

736
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:49,340
I'd like
to discuss your future.

737
00:40:49,413 --> 00:40:52,246
Hold on. Don't jive me now.
I ain't for sale.

738
00:40:52,483 --> 00:40:53,973
May I sit down?

739
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,588
You see, Mr. Charles,

740
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:01,417
Jack Lauderdale
has found himself,

741
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:03,686
shall we say,
a little overextended,

742
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:06,926
and has had to
unload some of his talent.

743
00:41:06,997 --> 00:41:08,965
When your name
came up, I jumped at

744
00:41:09,033 --> 00:41:10,967
the chance to work with you.
I'm a big fan.

745
00:41:11,035 --> 00:41:12,935
What if I want to go
to another company?

746
00:41:13,003 --> 00:41:15,437
There's a guy out there right
now that is willing to pay me

747
00:41:15,506 --> 00:41:17,872
seven cents a record.
Can you do that?

748
00:41:18,242 --> 00:41:21,040
Man, I could promise you
15 cents a record,

749
00:41:21,879 --> 00:41:25,315
but you won't get it any
more than he'll pay you seven.

750
00:41:27,051 --> 00:41:30,214
What I will do is promise
you five cents a record

751
00:41:30,387 --> 00:41:32,685
and pay you five cents
a record.

752
00:41:33,457 --> 00:41:36,722
If you think pennies,
Mr. Charles, you get pennies.

753
00:41:37,595 --> 00:41:39,324
You think dollars,

754
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:41,923
you get dollars.

755
00:41:43,901 --> 00:41:46,665
I like how you put
things together, man.

756
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:48,661
Ahem, you know what?

757
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:51,698
Omelet,
you're all right with me.

758
00:41:52,109 --> 00:41:53,303
Ahmet.
Ahmet.

759
00:41:53,377 --> 00:41:54,537
What kind of name is that?

760
00:41:54,612 --> 00:41:55,840
I'm Turkish.

761
00:41:55,946 --> 00:41:57,140
Well, you know what?

762
00:41:57,214 --> 00:42:00,115
I guess Jack Lauderdale's
bad luck is my good fortune.

763
00:42:00,251 --> 00:42:03,311
I knew that Atlantic Records
was bigger than Swing Time.

764
00:42:03,387 --> 00:42:05,947
You guys do good music.
I dig Atlantic.

765
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:07,490
You could have fooled me.

766
00:42:07,558 --> 00:42:10,254
Well, you know, I gotta
keep my eye on you city boys.

767
00:42:10,828 --> 00:42:12,659
Down home,
we call it "country dumb. "

768
00:42:14,765 --> 00:42:16,630
Hey, man, it ain't Turkish.

769
00:42:21,672 --> 00:42:23,970
Went to see my sweetheart

770
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:27,639
Last night around
about ten

771
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:31,579
She said, move, sweet papa

772
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:34,941
Squeeze me
every now and then

773
00:42:35,185 --> 00:42:36,914
What do you think?

774
00:42:36,987 --> 00:42:39,387
Man, nobody wants
another Nat King Cole.

775
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:42,526
'Cause she sleep that way

776
00:42:42,593 --> 00:42:45,619
The midnight hour

777
00:42:46,864 --> 00:42:49,458
Has found me lonely

778
00:42:50,701 --> 00:42:52,601
So unhappy

779
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:55,667
As I can be

780
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:58,706
Ahmet, it's just
like Charles Brown.

781
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:03,345
Okay, I'll talk to him.

782
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:08,817
All right, fellas, that's
a cut. That's a cut, fellas.

783
00:43:09,453 --> 00:43:10,715
Fellas!

784
00:43:10,788 --> 00:43:12,119
Band can take five.

785
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:13,587
He just don't get it.

786
00:43:13,657 --> 00:43:16,649
You either sound original,
or you got nothin'.

787
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,955
Ahmet,
what'd you think of that?

788
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:22,259
Ray, I want to tell you something,
and I don't want you to take it wrong.

789
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:23,664
Then give it to me right.

790
00:43:23,734 --> 00:43:27,135
I signed you because I sensed
something special in you

791
00:43:27,204 --> 00:43:30,401
not because you sound like
Nat Cole or Charles Brown.

792
00:43:30,474 --> 00:43:32,305
I thought you like what I do.

793
00:43:32,376 --> 00:43:34,310
We-we love the timbre
of your voice,

794
00:43:34,378 --> 00:43:36,608
we like your virtuosity,
your energy-

795
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:37,942
But not my music.

796
00:43:38,015 --> 00:43:39,448
Come on, man,
I didn't say that.

797
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:41,975
Ahmet, this is what I do, man.

798
00:43:42,052 --> 00:43:44,179
I gotta make a living.
This is what the people want.

799
00:43:44,254 --> 00:43:45,846
I don't know no other way.

800
00:43:45,923 --> 00:43:47,652
We got to help you find one.

801
00:43:47,725 --> 00:43:50,057
Look, let's try a little
change of pace, okay?

802
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:51,526
You're familiar
with stride piano?

803
00:43:51,595 --> 00:43:54,894
You kidding me, man? The man who I
learned the piano from is a stride player.

804
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:57,991
Okay, I got a song.
It's called The Mess Around.

805
00:43:58,068 --> 00:43:59,899
The Mess Around.
Cute title. Who wrote it?

806
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:01,369
I did.

807
00:44:01,605 --> 00:44:03,038
Ah, you wrote it.

808
00:44:03,107 --> 00:44:04,096
Yeah.

809
00:44:04,508 --> 00:44:05,873
Well, sing it to me, man.

810
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:07,303
Sing it?
Yeah.

811
00:44:07,378 --> 00:44:09,039
It ain't like
I can read the lyrics.

812
00:44:09,113 --> 00:44:11,707
Okay.
Well, it's the key of G.

813
00:44:11,782 --> 00:44:13,215
Okay. Key of G.

814
00:44:14,351 --> 00:44:15,340
Uh-huh.

815
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:17,142
Yeah.

816
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:20,154
Yeah, but it's a kind of
Pete Johnson thing.

817
00:44:20,257 --> 00:44:21,622
Pete Johnson.

818
00:44:23,427 --> 00:44:25,088
Yeah, yeah, that's it.

819
00:44:25,195 --> 00:44:27,254
You like that?
Here we go. Two, three, four.

820
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:30,630
You can talk
about the pit barbecue

821
00:44:30,701 --> 00:44:32,931
The band was jumpin',
the people, too

822
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:34,994
They're doin'
the mess around

823
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:37,864
They're doin'
the mess around

824
00:44:38,742 --> 00:44:40,676
They're doin'
the mess around

825
00:44:40,744 --> 00:44:42,735
Everybody doin'
the mess around

826
00:44:42,813 --> 00:44:44,974
All right, that's good.
Let me take it from here.

827
00:44:45,049 --> 00:44:48,610
Now this band's gonna
play from nine to one

828
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:51,280
Everybody here's gonna
have some fun

829
00:44:51,388 --> 00:44:53,151
Doin' the mess around

830
00:44:53,924 --> 00:44:56,154
Ah, doin' the mess around

831
00:44:57,761 --> 00:44:59,956
They doin' the mess around

832
00:45:00,064 --> 00:45:02,157
Everybody doin'
the mess around

833
00:45:04,301 --> 00:45:07,737
Now you see that girl
with that diamond ring

834
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:11,170
She knows
how to shake that thing

835
00:45:11,642 --> 00:45:13,166
Mess around

836
00:45:13,744 --> 00:45:15,712
I declare
she can mess around

837
00:45:17,314 --> 00:45:19,043
Ah, mess around

838
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:21,816
Everybody do
the mess around

839
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:29,415
Now we got something!

840
00:45:29,493 --> 00:45:30,983
That's all right there.

841
00:45:32,496 --> 00:45:33,758
What do you think, Ahmet?

842
00:45:33,831 --> 00:45:34,855
Great, Ray!

843
00:45:34,932 --> 00:45:36,058
Unbelievable!

844
00:45:36,133 --> 00:45:37,225
Who's that?

845
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:40,430
Ray, I want you to meet
my new partner, Jerry.

846
00:45:40,537 --> 00:45:42,095
Mr. Ray Charles,
Jerry Wexler.

847
00:45:42,172 --> 00:45:43,161
Hey.

848
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:46,300
Don't worry, Ray. I'm going
to step back, I'm gonna watch,

849
00:45:46,376 --> 00:45:48,776
I'm gonna learn how to
produce a record. I'm in awe.

850
00:45:48,846 --> 00:45:50,074
That was out of sight.

851
00:45:50,147 --> 00:45:51,944
That's some running
and riffing, man!

852
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:53,944
Well,
this'll make you shout, man.

853
00:46:02,059 --> 00:46:04,823
We're listening to that
new recording, Mess Around

854
00:46:04,895 --> 00:46:07,193
by Atlantic recording artist,
Ray Charles.

855
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:10,756
And we have the gentleman
live here in the KCOH studios.

856
00:46:10,834 --> 00:46:13,894
So, Ray, when you're not making your
own music, what do you listen to?

857
00:46:13,971 --> 00:46:17,634
You know what, the fact is, King
Bee, I really and truly love gospel.

858
00:46:17,708 --> 00:46:20,609
One of my favorite groups
is from right here in Houston:

859
00:46:20,677 --> 00:46:22,542
the Cecil Shaw Singers.

860
00:46:22,746 --> 00:46:26,273
You heard it: Ray Charles
endorses Houston's own Cecil Shaw.

861
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:28,284
We'll be playing
gospel all day Sunday

862
00:46:28,352 --> 00:46:30,047
but right now,
let's hear some more

863
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,747
of that Mess Around
by Ray Charles.

864
00:46:31,822 --> 00:46:33,153
K.B., line 1.

865
00:46:35,526 --> 00:46:36,891
King Bee.

866
00:46:38,595 --> 00:46:39,584
Mmm-hmm.

867
00:46:40,597 --> 00:46:42,258
Yeah, he's right here.

868
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:45,460
Miss Della Antwine
of the Cecil Shaw Singers.

869
00:46:48,939 --> 00:46:50,770
Hello, Miss Antwine.

870
00:46:51,175 --> 00:46:53,939
You sung tenor in
Jesus Is My Shepherd, right?

871
00:46:54,011 --> 00:46:55,239
Yes.

872
00:46:56,046 --> 00:46:57,809
How did you pick me out?

873
00:46:57,881 --> 00:47:00,873
Actually,
I- I hear like you see.

874
00:47:01,618 --> 00:47:04,678
Like that hummingbird outside
the window, for instance.

875
00:47:10,861 --> 00:47:12,123
I can't hear her.

876
00:47:12,196 --> 00:47:13,458
You have to listen.

877
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:32,573
Yes.

878
00:47:32,649 --> 00:47:33,638
Yeah.

879
00:47:33,917 --> 00:47:35,077
Yes, you can.

880
00:47:35,152 --> 00:47:36,176
OH-OH.

881
00:47:36,253 --> 00:47:37,242
You hear that?

882
00:47:37,321 --> 00:47:38,345
What?

883
00:47:39,089 --> 00:47:41,250
Her heart just
skipped a beat.

884
00:47:43,493 --> 00:47:45,358
Oh, did you like my record?

885
00:47:45,662 --> 00:47:48,028
The one that King Bee
was playin'?

886
00:47:49,466 --> 00:47:51,093
It was very nice.

887
00:47:51,335 --> 00:47:53,530
Different than the others.

888
00:47:54,104 --> 00:47:56,038
I've heard
a lot of your music.

889
00:47:56,106 --> 00:47:57,664
Was it very nice, too?

890
00:47:57,741 --> 00:48:00,005
Look, Miss Antwine, if you
don't really like the record,

891
00:48:00,077 --> 00:48:03,478
you ain't got to beat around the bush
with me. I mean, my mama never did.

892
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:05,845
It's not that I don't
enjoy your music.

893
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:08,248
It's just that I feel
I've heard it before.

894
00:48:08,318 --> 00:48:10,843
I keep wondering what the
real Ray Charles sound like.

895
00:48:10,921 --> 00:48:12,411
Ray Charles? Who's he?

896
00:48:12,489 --> 00:48:14,389
Nobody,
if you don't know.

897
00:48:14,458 --> 00:48:15,447
Huh?

898
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:18,728
Sorry. I should have
kept my mouth shut.

899
00:48:18,795 --> 00:48:20,990
Oh, no, no.
Then you wouldn't be you.

900
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:24,599
You know, it's not like I
haven't heard that before.

901
00:48:24,668 --> 00:48:28,001
I guess I just, uh, never
really listened, that's all.

902
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:33,176
Ain't nobody ever put
it that sweet, I guess.

903
00:48:50,394 --> 00:48:52,294
You know what,
Miss Della Bea Antwine?

904
00:48:52,362 --> 00:48:54,489
You really are a country girl.
You know that?

905
00:48:54,564 --> 00:48:56,532
Yes.
How'd you know?

906
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,659
I could tell by
the way you ordered.

907
00:48:58,735 --> 00:49:00,896
"Let me get molasses
with my cornbread. "

908
00:49:02,139 --> 00:49:03,834
Were you raised
on a farm?

909
00:49:03,907 --> 00:49:06,740
My mother did a little
sharecropping in Florida.

910
00:49:06,810 --> 00:49:08,300
Is she still there?

911
00:49:08,378 --> 00:49:11,211
God bless her heart, she passed
away when I went to school.

912
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:12,771
Ray, I'm sorry.

913
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:14,945
She never was
real healthy.

914
00:49:15,018 --> 00:49:17,578
She just worked herself
to death, poor thing.

915
00:49:17,688 --> 00:49:20,452
That's why she didn't want
me carrying around no tin cup.

916
00:49:20,524 --> 00:49:22,253
The kids
I went to school with,

917
00:49:22,326 --> 00:49:25,022
they were doing basket-weavin'
and wickerwork.

918
00:49:25,896 --> 00:49:28,194
But not you.
Because of your gift.

919
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:29,925
Because of my ears.

920
00:49:30,233 --> 00:49:32,133
See, I can mimic
damn near anybody,

921
00:49:32,202 --> 00:49:34,898
and I-I-I-I make a pretty
decent living at it.

922
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:37,031
It's just, if I
change my style up

923
00:49:37,107 --> 00:49:38,631
and people
really don't dig it,

924
00:49:38,709 --> 00:49:40,973
I mean, what am I
left with, you know?

925
00:49:41,211 --> 00:49:43,577
I mean, when you're blind,
Miss Antwine,

926
00:49:43,714 --> 00:49:45,807
you ain't got
that many choices.

927
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:49,541
Seem to me like you got all
the choices in the world.

928
00:49:50,721 --> 00:49:52,518
God gave you
the gift to sound

929
00:49:52,589 --> 00:49:54,887
like anybody you please,
even yourself.

930
00:49:56,626 --> 00:49:58,821
We're here.
This is where I live.

931
00:49:59,963 --> 00:50:01,794
Well, you think
the preacher'd let me in?

932
00:50:01,865 --> 00:50:04,197
I mean, uh, I'm a sinner,
but I need a little prayer.

933
00:50:04,267 --> 00:50:06,758
His wife don't like
me having male company.

934
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:09,998
Well, tell him there's a soul
out here that needs savin'.

935
00:50:10,774 --> 00:50:14,175
You know what, Miss Antwine,
you really got me thinkin'.

936
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:17,480
About what?

937
00:50:17,581 --> 00:50:20,914
About my life.
About my music.

938
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:24,510
About everything.

939
00:50:26,757 --> 00:50:30,249
Ray, don't-don't you think
we're movin' a little fast?

940
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:33,958
Listen, I'm-I'm gonna
go to New York

941
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:36,522
for a couple of weeks,
and when I get back,

942
00:50:36,933 --> 00:50:39,401
you can take it as
slow as you want.

943
00:50:42,072 --> 00:50:43,903
All right, Mr. Charles.

944
00:50:45,275 --> 00:50:47,038
All right, Miss Antwine.

945
00:50:47,444 --> 00:50:49,071
I'll see you
in a couple of weeks.

946
00:50:49,146 --> 00:50:51,171
Well, hold on, now.
Let me call you a cab.

947
00:50:51,248 --> 00:50:52,943
I got it. Three blocks up,

948
00:50:53,016 --> 00:50:55,712
left for two, right for one.

949
00:50:55,819 --> 00:50:57,514
Fifteen giant steps,

950
00:50:57,587 --> 00:50:59,521
and I'm at the
Crystal White Hotel. Hello.
