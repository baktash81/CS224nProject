1
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:36,257
Locutus.

2
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:44,516
I am Locutus of Borg.
Resistance is futile.

3
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:27,642
Authorisation: Picard 47-AT.

4
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:32,105
- Did I catch you at a bad time?
- No, Admiral, of course not.

5
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:38,486
I`ve just heard that our colony on
Ivor Prime has been destroyed.

6
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:42,157
- Long-range sensors...
- Yes, I know. The Borg.

7
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:50,415
Captain’s log: Stardate 50893.5.

8
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:55,086
The moment have dreaded for
nearly six years has finally arrived.

9
00:04:55,337 --> 00:05:01,217
The Borg, our lethal enemy, have
begun an invasion of the Federation.

10
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:05,055
This time
there maybe no stopping them.

11
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:08,850
- How many ships?
- One, on a direct course for Earth.

12
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:14,147
They’ll be in Federation space soon.
Admiral Hayes is mobilising a fleet.

13
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:18,318
- It will take us three hours...
- We’re not going.

14
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:22,989
- What do you mean?
- We’re to patrol the Neutral Zone.

15
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:28,370
In case the Romulans decide
to take advantage of the situation.

16
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:35,293
There has been no unusual activity
along the Romulan border.

17
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:39,881
Does Starfleet feel
we need more shakedown time?

18
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:45,929
We`re ready! The Enterprise E is
the most advanced ship in the fleet.

19
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:50,892
I have gone over all this
with Starfleet. Their orders stand.

20
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:59,150
Number One,
set a course for the Neutral Zone.

21
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:36,604
- Bizet?
- Berlioz. What do you have?

22
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:40,859
We`ve finished
our first sweep of the Neutral Zone.

23
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:45,530
Fascinating.
20 particles of dust per cubic metre.

24
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:50,118
52 ultraviolet radiation spikes
and a class-two comet.

25
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:54,289
This is certainly
worthy of our attention.

26
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:58,335
Captain, why are we out here?

27
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:02,839
Starfleet has every confidence
in the Enterprise and her crew.

28
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:06,760
They`re just not sure
about her captain.

29
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:11,139
A man once captured
and assimilated by the Borg -

30
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:15,935
- should not be put in a situation
where he would face them again.

31
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:21,524
It would introduce an unstable element
to a critical situation.

32
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:26,738
Your experience makes you
the perfect man to lead this fight.

33
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:32,327
Bridge to Captain Picard.

34
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:36,873
We`ve received word from the fleet,
they`ve engaged the Borg.

35
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:45,090
Mr Data, put Starfleet frequency 1486
on audio.

36
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:50,762
Flagship Endeavour,
stand by to engage.

37
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:54,808
Defiant and Bozeman,
fallback to mobile position one.

38
00:07:55,058 --> 00:08:01,356
We have it in visual range.
A Borg cube on course 0215 ...

39
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:06,319
We are the Borg. Lower your shields
and surrender your ships.

40
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:11,408
We will add your biological
distinctiveness to our own.

41
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:16,496
Your culture will adapt to serve us.
Resistance is futile.

42
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:20,667
All units, open fire.

43
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:24,504
They`ve broken through
the defence perimeter.

44
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:30,468
Continue to attack.

45
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:34,097
We need reinforcements.

46
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:39,436
96 dead and 22 wounded
on the Lexington.

47
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:46,651
Lt Hawk, set a course for Earth.
Maximum warp.

48
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:52,282
I am about to disobey our orders.

49
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:56,911
Any of you who wish to object
should do so now.

50
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:05,920
I believe I speak for everyone here
when I say ...

51
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:11,009
... to hell with our orders.

52
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:19,351
Red alert. All hands to battle stations.
Engage.

53
00:09:55,637 --> 00:10:00,642
- Report!
- Power off-line, our weapons are gone.

54
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:09,192
Perhaps today is a good day to die.
Prepare for ramming speed.

55
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:12,946
Sir, there`s another ship coming in.

56
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:17,117
It`s the Enterprise.

57
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:29,546
- The Defiant is losing life support.
- Beam the survivors aboard.

58
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:32,924
They`ve destroyed the admiral`s ship.

59
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:38,513
- What is the status of the Borg cube?
- The outer hull has been damaged.

60
00:10:38,722 --> 00:10:42,308
I am reading fluctuations
in their power grid.

61
00:10:50,734 --> 00:10:55,989
Number One,
open a channel to the fleet.

62
00:10:56,239 --> 00:11:00,744
This is Capt Picard.
I`m taking command of the fleet.

63
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:05,331
Plot in the following coordinates.
Fire on my command.

64
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:10,545
- Is that a vital system?
- Trust me, Data.

65
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:15,592
The fleet has responded, sir,
they`re standing by.

66
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,305
Fire.

67
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:59,177
- Mr Hawk, pursuit course. Engage.
- Aye, sir.

68
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:09,646
- What?
- I can hear them.

69
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:15,527
I have a patient here
who insists on coming to the bridge.

70
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:20,031
- Welcome aboard, Mr Worf.
- Thank you, sir.

71
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:23,743
- The Defiant?
- Adrift, but salvageable.

72
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:27,414
- Tough little ship.
- Little?

73
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:31,751
Mr Worf, we could use some help
at tactical.

74
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:38,258
You do remember
how to fire phasers?

75
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:48,727
We`re detecting
chronometric particles.

76
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:52,230
- They`re creating a temporal vortex.
- Time travel.

77
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:06,119
- Data, report.
- We`re caught in a temporal wake.

78
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:09,497
Captain ... Earth.

79
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:16,963
There are high concentrations
of methane and carbon monoxide.

80
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:22,093
- Life signs?
- Approximately nine billion.

81
00:13:22,344 --> 00:13:25,180
- All Borg.
- How?.

82
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:30,560
They did it in the past. They went back
and assimilated Earth, changed history.

83
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,605
Why are we still here?

84
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:39,194
The temporal wake protected us
from changes in the time line.

85
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:44,074
- The vortex is collapsing.
- Hold your course.

86
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:48,328
We must follow them back
and repair the damage they`ve done.

87
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:23,446
- Come on.
- Good night, Eddie.

88
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:26,366
Go home.

89
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:29,452
You`ll regret this tomorrow.

90
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:35,875
You should have learned by now
that I don`t have regrets.

91
00:14:36,126 --> 00:14:39,754
- One more round, Lily.
- Z, you`ve had enough.

92
00:14:40,005 --> 00:14:45,468
- I`m not flying with a drunken pilot.
- I can`t fly sober.

93
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:50,056
What is that?

94
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:55,687
- That is the constellation Leo.
- No, that!

95
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:08,700
- It`s the ECON.
- After all these years?

96
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:17,709
We`ve got to get to the Phoenix.

97
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:25,383
To hell with the Phoenix.

98
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:49,699
Shields are down.
Main power is holding.

99
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:53,703
We are in the mid 21st century.

100
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:59,709
I would estimate we have arrived
ten years after the Third World War.

101
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:04,381
That makes sense. Most of the
major cities have been destroyed.

102
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:09,010
- 600 million dead. No resistance.
- Captain.

103
00:16:12,055 --> 00:16:16,017
Mr Worf, quantum torpedoes.
Fire.

104
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:32,909
They were firing at the surface.
Location?

105
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:36,621
Western hemisphere.
North American Continent.

106
00:16:36,871 --> 00:16:42,919
- A missile complex in Montana.
- A missile complex?.

107
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:46,715
Data, I need to know the exact date.

108
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:50,010
April 4th, 2063.

109
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:54,014
April 4th.
The day before First Contact.

110
00:16:54,264 --> 00:16:58,810
The missile complex must be
where Cochrane is building his ship.

111
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,730
They came to stop First Contact.

112
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:05,734
- How much damage, Lieutenant?
- I can`t tell.

113
00:17:05,984 --> 00:17:09,988
We`ll have to go down there
and find out what happened.

114
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:12,907
Have a security team ready.

115
00:17:13,158 --> 00:17:16,745
Computer, 21st century clothing.

116
00:17:16,995 --> 00:17:18,872
Number One, you have the Bridge.

117
00:17:29,424 --> 00:17:32,344
Over here.

118
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:58,328
They`re all dead.

119
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:07,003
See if one of them is Cochrane.
Data, let`s go check the warp ship.

120
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:32,821
The structural integrity of the missile
appears to be intact.

121
00:18:33,071 --> 00:18:36,157
The fuselage is slightly damaged.

122
00:18:36,408 --> 00:18:42,414
We have the blueprints.
We need a team down here.

123
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:47,919
- Hold your fire. We`re here to help.
- Bullshit!

124
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,676
Captain, I believe I can handle this.

125
00:19:17,032 --> 00:19:19,200
Greetings.

126
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:30,462
This woman
requires medical attention.

127
00:19:35,967 --> 00:19:40,847
- Severe radiation poisoning.
- From the damaged ship.

128
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:45,352
I have to get her to sick bay.

129
00:19:45,602 --> 00:19:49,522
No lectures on the prime directive,
l`ll keep her unconscious.

130
00:19:49,773 --> 00:19:53,985
Tell Riker to beam down with
a search party to find Cochrane.

131
00:19:54,235 --> 00:19:59,032
Crusher to Enterprise.
Two to beam directly to sick bay.

132
00:20:03,328 --> 00:20:07,540
In 48 hours
this ship has to be launched.

133
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:13,421
Geordi, the ship was damaged in the
attack. Get a repair crew down here.

134
00:20:13,672 --> 00:20:20,011
I`m on my way. Alpha team,
we`re heading down to the surface.

135
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:23,181
Porter, take command while l`m gone.

136
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:28,895
Check out the environmental controls.
It`s a little warm in here.

137
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:51,167
Isn`t it amazing?

138
00:20:51,418 --> 00:20:56,089
This ship
used to be a nuclear missile.

139
00:20:56,339 --> 00:21:00,510
An historical irony. Using an
instrument of mass destruction -

140
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,222
- to inaugurate an era of peace.

141
00:21:14,232 --> 00:21:20,113
A boyhood fantasy. I`ve seen
this ship in the Smithsonian, -

142
00:21:20,363 --> 00:21:23,491
- but I was never able to touch it.

143
00:21:23,742 --> 00:21:28,747
Does tactile contact
alter your perception of the Phoenix?.

144
00:21:28,997 --> 00:21:34,753
For humans, touch can connect you
to an object in a very personal way.

145
00:21:35,003 --> 00:21:38,340
It makes it seem more real.

146
00:21:43,511 --> 00:21:48,183
I`m detecting imperfections
in the titanium casing.

147
00:21:48,433 --> 00:21:52,187
Temperature variations
in the fuel manifold.

148
00:21:52,437 --> 00:21:56,316
It is no more real to me now
than it was a moment ago.

149
00:21:56,566 --> 00:22:01,237
- Would you three like to be alone?
- What have you found out?

150
00:22:01,488 --> 00:22:05,867
- There`s no sign of Cochrane.
- He has to be here.

151
00:22:06,117 --> 00:22:10,372
This ship and this flight
were his dream.

152
00:22:10,622 --> 00:22:15,377
We should consider the possibility
that Dr Cochrane died in the attack.

153
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:22,550
If that`s true ...
then the future may die with him.

154
00:22:30,725 --> 00:22:35,021
- What do you think?.
- The entire system has gone crazy.

155
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:40,527
It`s affecting the entire deck.
I`ll check the EPS conduits.

156
00:22:47,909 --> 00:22:53,581
- Hello? Hey!
- Are you talking to me?

157
00:22:54,499 --> 00:22:57,544
Is anyone else working up here?

158
00:22:57,794 --> 00:23:01,131
Not that I know of.

159
00:23:10,932 --> 00:23:13,059
Paul?

160
00:23:16,563 --> 00:23:20,817
Paul, are you okay in there?

161
00:23:37,292 --> 00:23:40,378
Captain, what is it?

162
00:23:43,173 --> 00:23:47,510
Picard to Enterprise. Mr Worf,
is everything all right up there?

163
00:23:47,761 --> 00:23:52,849
We are experiencing some
environmental diffiiculties.

164
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:59,105
Humidityhas risen 73()%()
and the temperature is up 10 degrees.

165
00:23:59,356 --> 00:24:05,236
Mr Data and I will be right there.
Number One, take charge down here.

166
00:24:05,487 --> 00:24:11,659
The damage to her cell membranes
is repaired. She should be fine.

167
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:15,205
Find out why it`s so hot in here.

168
00:24:15,455 --> 00:24:19,209
- Now what?
- Crusher to Engineering.

169
00:24:20,418 --> 00:24:21,753
Crusher to Bridge.

170
00:24:24,422 --> 00:24:28,551
- Exactly what`s been happening?
- We`ve lost contact with Deck 16.

171
00:24:28,802 --> 00:24:33,139
I was about to send
a security team to investigate.

172
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:37,769
No, seal off Deck 16. Post
security teams at every access point.

173
00:24:38,019 --> 00:24:42,399
What environmental conditions
were last reported in Engineering?

174
00:24:42,649 --> 00:24:47,696
92()%() humidity.
39.1 degrees Celsius.

175
00:24:47,946 --> 00:24:52,951
39.1 degrees Celsius ...
Iike a Borg ship.

176
00:24:53,201 --> 00:24:57,288
They knew their ship was doomed.
Our shields were down.

177
00:24:57,539 --> 00:25:01,459
Somehow they transported over here
without being detected.

178
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:06,548
They`ll assimilate the Enterprise ...
and then Earth.

179
00:25:08,508 --> 00:25:11,678
Picard to Riker.

180
00:25:13,138 --> 00:25:16,558
Enterprise to Away Team.

181
00:25:17,684 --> 00:25:20,478
Respond.

182
00:25:20,729 --> 00:25:26,151
Main control is being re-routed
through Engineering.

183
00:25:26,401 --> 00:25:29,863
Data, lock out the main computer.

184
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:42,876
I have isolated the main computer
with an encryption code.

185
00:25:43,126 --> 00:25:47,297
The Borg have cut primary power
to all decks except 16.

186
00:25:47,547 --> 00:25:49,799
The Borg won`t stay on Deck 16.

187
00:25:52,594 --> 00:25:56,598
You`re all right. Come on, wake up.

188
00:25:58,058 --> 00:26:01,269
You are all right. Listen to me.

189
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:05,106
You`re going to be fine.
I need you to do as I say.

190
00:26:05,357 --> 00:26:09,944
- Is the EMH programme on-line?
- It should be.

191
00:26:10,195 --> 00:26:16,409
- Activate the EMH programme.
- What is the nature of the emergency?.

192
00:26:16,659 --> 00:26:21,498
20 Borg are about to break in here.
Create a diversion.

193
00:26:21,748 --> 00:26:25,293
This isn`t part of my programme.
I`m a doctor.

194
00:26:25,543 --> 00:26:29,756
Do a dance, tell a story,
just give us a few seconds.

195
00:26:36,429 --> 00:26:43,019
According to medical research, Borg
implants can cause skin irritations.

196
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:47,607
Perhaps you`d like
an analgesic cream.

197
00:26:51,903 --> 00:26:54,239
Which way?.

198
00:26:54,489 --> 00:26:58,118
We need to get off this deck.
Follow me.

199
00:27:11,297 --> 00:27:17,137
Engineering will be the central point
from which they control the hive.

200
00:27:17,387 --> 00:27:22,976
If we begin firing in there,
we may hit the warp core.

201
00:27:25,603 --> 00:27:31,568
Our goal should be to puncture
one of the plasma coolant tanks.

202
00:27:31,818 --> 00:27:37,490
Plasma coolant will liquefy
organic material on contact.

203
00:27:37,741 --> 00:27:42,829
The Borg cannot survive
without their organic components.

204
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:46,916
All weapons will be set
on a rotating modulation.

205
00:27:47,167 --> 00:27:51,254
The Borg will adapt quickly.
We`ll be able to fire 12 shots at most.

206
00:27:51,504 --> 00:27:58,511
You may encounter crew members
who have already been assimilated.

207
00:27:58,762 --> 00:28:06,102
Don`t hesitate to fire. Believe me,
you`ll be doing them a favour. Let`s go.

208
00:28:35,048 --> 00:28:37,175
Deanna!

209
00:28:40,595 --> 00:28:43,890
Deanna!

210
00:28:45,558 --> 00:28:49,229
Will, don`t turn off that ..!

211
00:28:49,479 --> 00:28:56,069
Who is this jerk?. And who told him
he could turn off my music?

212
00:28:56,319 --> 00:29:01,116
Will Riker, Zefram Cochrane.

213
00:29:03,827 --> 00:29:06,871
- Is he a friend of yours?
- Yes.

214
00:29:07,122 --> 00:29:09,374
- Husband?
- No?

215
00:29:09,624 --> 00:29:12,002
Good.

216
00:29:13,086 --> 00:29:16,131
- This, Deena ...
- Deanna.

217
00:29:17,757 --> 00:29:21,344
This ... is the good stuff.

218
00:29:21,594 --> 00:29:24,681
Dr Cochrane ...

219
00:29:24,931 --> 00:29:29,185
To the Phoenix ...
May she rest in peace.

220
00:29:37,694 --> 00:29:40,905
Okay, that wasn`t so good.

221
00:29:42,657 --> 00:29:48,204
- We have to tell him the truth.
- Then the time line ...

222
00:29:48,455 --> 00:29:53,543
This is no time to argue about time.
We don`t have the time.

223
00:29:58,548 --> 00:30:03,011
- What was I saying?
- You`re drunk.

224
00:30:03,261 --> 00:30:08,350
He wouldn`t even talk to me
unless I had a drink with him.

225
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:14,773
It took three shots of tequila
just to find out his name.

226
00:30:15,023 --> 00:30:19,569
I`ve spent the last 20 minutes
trying to keep his hands off me.

227
00:30:19,819 --> 00:30:24,115
So don`t go criticising
my counselling techniques.

228
00:30:26,826 --> 00:30:30,747
It`s a primitive culture.

229
00:30:30,997 --> 00:30:38,004
I`m just trying to blend in.
He didn`t believe our cover story.

230
00:30:38,254 --> 00:30:43,385
We`re running out of time.
Will he be able to handle the truth?

231
00:30:46,054 --> 00:30:52,936
If you`re looking for my
professional opinion ... He`s nuts.

232
00:30:53,186 --> 00:30:56,314
I`ll be sure to note that in my log.

233
00:32:23,902 --> 00:32:29,240
Captain, I believe l`m feeling ...
anxiety.

234
00:32:29,491 --> 00:32:32,619
It is an intriguing sensation.

235
00:32:32,869 --> 00:32:39,000
Data, perhaps you should deactivate
your emotion chip for now.

236
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:44,214
Good idea, sir ... Done.

237
00:32:44,464 --> 00:32:48,134
Data, there are times that I envy you.

238
00:33:00,021 --> 00:33:05,151
It`s only me! We have wounded here.

239
00:33:06,695 --> 00:33:12,033
- Get these people back to Deck 14.
- There was a civilian with us.

240
00:33:12,283 --> 00:33:17,080
- We`ll watch for her.
- Please, try to find her.

241
00:33:38,977 --> 00:33:44,315
Lower your weapons. They`ll ignore
us till the consider us a threat.

242
00:34:27,901 --> 00:34:30,362
The manual release.

243
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:35,158
Mr Worf, hold this position.

244
00:34:40,914 --> 00:34:44,125
Manualrelease on-line.

245
00:34:50,757 --> 00:34:54,344
Perhaps we should just knock.

246
00:34:56,221 --> 00:34:58,682
Data.

247
00:35:10,276 --> 00:35:12,779
Ready phasers.

248
00:35:24,916 --> 00:35:27,085
Data, cover me.

249
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:38,179
Captain, they have adapted.

250
00:36:15,592 --> 00:36:19,971
Regroup on Deck 15.
Don`t let them touch you.

251
00:36:22,307 --> 00:36:25,685
- Captain!
- Data!

252
00:36:44,537 --> 00:36:47,248
Here!

253
00:36:50,794 --> 00:36:54,089
Help!

254
00:36:54,339 --> 00:36:57,342
Please, help.

255
00:37:16,695 --> 00:37:21,199
- You! How the hell ..?
- Back off!

256
00:37:21,449 --> 00:37:26,538
Who are you?
What faction are you with?

257
00:37:26,788 --> 00:37:32,293
- I`m not with the Eastern Coalition.
- Just get me the hell out of here.

258
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:36,339
- Now!
- That isn`t going to be easy.

259
00:37:36,589 --> 00:37:41,386
You`d better find a way,
or l`m going to start pushing buttons.

260
00:37:44,139 --> 00:37:47,684
- Follow me.
- Slow!

261
00:38:31,019 --> 00:38:34,898
You won`t be able to break
the encryption codes.

262
00:38:35,148 --> 00:38:38,610
Nor will you
be able to assimilate me.

263
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:42,072
Brave words.
I`ve heard them before.

264
00:38:42,322 --> 00:38:48,078
From thousands ofspecies
across thousands ofworlds.

265
00:38:48,328 --> 00:38:51,414
Butnow they are alIBorg.

266
00:38:51,664 --> 00:38:59,047
I am unlike any life form
you have encountered before.

267
00:38:59,297 --> 00:39:03,259
You are an imperfectbeing,
created by an imperfectbeing.

268
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:08,765
Findingyour weakness
is only a matter oftime.

269
00:39:16,481 --> 00:39:20,402
Let me make sure I understand you
correctly, Commander.

270
00:39:20,652 --> 00:39:25,657
A group of cybernetic creatures
from the future -

271
00:39:25,907 --> 00:39:30,078
- have travelled back through time
to enslave the human race.

272
00:39:30,328 --> 00:39:36,209
And you`re here to stop them?
Hot damn! You`re heroic.

273
00:39:37,794 --> 00:39:44,259
- We`re going to prove it to you.
- There she is! Beautiful!

274
00:39:45,093 --> 00:39:49,764
- All right, take a look.
- Well, well, well ...

275
00:39:50,015 --> 00:39:54,477
What have we got here?
I love a good peep show.

276
00:40:06,406 --> 00:40:12,162
That`s a trick.
How did you do that?

277
00:40:12,412 --> 00:40:16,750
- It`s your telescope.
- That`s our ship. The Enterprise.

278
00:40:24,382 --> 00:40:29,346
And Lily is up there?
Can I talk to her?.

279
00:40:29,596 --> 00:40:33,850
We`ve lost contact with the ship.
We don`t know why yet.

280
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:40,273
- So what is it you want me to do?
- Conduct your flight as planned.

281
00:40:40,523 --> 00:40:43,651
Why tomorrow morning?

282
00:40:46,946 --> 00:40:51,659
At 1 1 o`clock an alien ship
will be passing this solar system.

283
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:55,747
Alien? You mean extra-terrestrials?

284
00:40:55,997 --> 00:40:59,417
- More bad guys?
- Good guys.

285
00:40:59,668 --> 00:41:02,962
They have no interest in Earth ...
too primitive.

286
00:41:05,465 --> 00:41:12,847
When they discover that humans have
learned how to fly faster than light, -

287
00:41:13,098 --> 00:41:17,477
- they alter their course and make
first contact with Earth right here.

288
00:41:17,727 --> 00:41:20,397
- Here?
- Actually, over there.

289
00:41:20,647 --> 00:41:26,027
It`s a pivotal moment in human history.
You make contact with an alien race.

290
00:41:26,277 --> 00:41:29,698
After you do,
everything begins to change.

291
00:41:29,948 --> 00:41:35,537
Fleets of starships are built
and mankind explores the galaxy.

292
00:41:35,787 --> 00:41:42,252
It unites humanity when they realise
they`re not alone in the universe.

293
00:41:42,502 --> 00:41:46,756
Poverty, disease and war
will all be gone in 50 years.

294
00:41:47,007 --> 00:41:52,721
But unless you make that warp flight
tomorrow, none of it will happen.

295
00:41:52,971 --> 00:41:56,975
You people are all astronauts ...

296
00:41:57,225 --> 00:42:00,186
... on some kind of star trek.

297
00:42:00,437 --> 00:42:04,733
I know this is a lot to take in,
but we`re running out of time.

298
00:42:04,983 --> 00:42:10,030
- We need your help.
- What do you say?.

299
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:24,210
Why not?

300
00:43:23,561 --> 00:43:28,274
It looks pretty bad, sir.
They control decks 26 up to 1 1 .

301
00:43:28,525 --> 00:43:32,737
When they took Deck 1 1 ,
they stopped.

302
00:43:32,987 --> 00:43:37,617
They`ve assimilated half the ship.
Why stop there?

303
00:43:37,867 --> 00:43:42,914
- What is on Deck 1 1?
- Hydroponics. Deflector control.

304
00:43:43,164 --> 00:43:47,419
They stopped there because
it gave them a tactical advantage.

305
00:43:47,669 --> 00:43:49,087
Return to your checkpoints.

306
00:43:51,756 --> 00:43:54,592
What happened in sick bay?.
Where`s Dr Crusher?.

307
00:43:54,843 --> 00:43:58,471
- Why did you break the cease-fire?
- We didn`t attack you.

308
00:44:03,143 --> 00:44:08,064
There`s a new faction that
wants to prevent tomorrow`s launch.

309
00:44:08,314 --> 00:44:13,987
We`re here to help you.
You are not in Montana anymore.

310
00:44:14,237 --> 00:44:19,367
You are on a spaceship
orbiting the Earth.

311
00:44:19,617 --> 00:44:24,330
- Get me out of here.
- All right.

312
00:44:26,166 --> 00:44:29,210
You want a way out. Here it is.

313
00:44:31,921 --> 00:44:35,008
What is this?

314
00:44:37,927 --> 00:44:41,973
Australia. New Guinea.
The Solomons.

315
00:44:42,223 --> 00:44:47,937
Montana will be up soon,
but it`s a long way down.

316
00:44:48,188 --> 00:44:52,442
I`m not your enemy
and I can get you home.

317
00:44:52,692 --> 00:44:56,529
Put the weapon down and trust me.

318
00:45:01,576 --> 00:45:07,791
Jean-Luc Picard.
That`s my name, what`s yours?

319
00:45:10,877 --> 00:45:14,714
- Lily.
- Welcome aboard, Lily.

320
00:45:21,638 --> 00:45:24,307
Thank you.

321
00:45:26,059 --> 00:45:30,313
Maximum setting. If you`d fired this,
you`d have vaporised me.

322
00:45:32,148 --> 00:45:35,402
It`s my first ray gun.

323
00:45:51,668 --> 00:45:58,800
- There`s no glass.
- Forcefield.

324
00:45:59,050 --> 00:46:05,849
- I`ve never seen such technology.
- It hasn`t been invented yet.

325
00:46:08,018 --> 00:46:10,520
There`s more I have to tell you.
Come on.

326
00:46:16,401 --> 00:46:19,362
Are you ready?

327
00:46:19,612 --> 00:46:22,699
- Who are you?
- I am the Borg.

328
00:46:22,949 --> 00:46:27,495
That is a contradiction. The Borg
have a collective consciousness.

329
00:46:27,746 --> 00:46:30,832
There are no individuals.

330
00:46:36,463 --> 00:46:42,844
I am the beginning, the end,
the one who is many.

331
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:59,986
I am the Borg.

332
00:47:01,154 --> 00:47:03,990
Greetings.

333
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:07,827
I am curious,
do you control the Borg collective?

334
00:47:08,078 --> 00:47:12,582
You imply disparity where
none exists. I am the collective.

335
00:47:12,832 --> 00:47:18,213
I`ll rephrase the question.
I wish to understand their hierarchy.

336
00:47:18,463 --> 00:47:21,508
Are you their leader?.

337
00:47:22,592 --> 00:47:26,554
I bring order to chaos.

338
00:47:26,805 --> 00:47:29,974
A cryptic response.

339
00:47:30,225 --> 00:47:33,144
You are in chaos, Data.

340
00:47:33,395 --> 00:47:37,148
You are a machine
who wishes to be human.

341
00:47:37,399 --> 00:47:44,030
I am programmed
to evolve and to better myself.

342
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:47,534
We, too, are on a quest
to better ourselves.

343
00:47:47,784 --> 00:47:50,662
Evolving toward a state of perfection.

344
00:47:50,912 --> 00:47:55,542
Forgive me, but the Borg
do not evolve, they conquer.

345
00:47:55,792 --> 00:48:03,341
By assimilating other beings we are
bringing them closer to perfection.

346
00:48:03,591 --> 00:48:07,887
Somehow I question your motives.

347
00:48:08,138 --> 00:48:14,936
That is because you haven`t
been properly ... stimulated yet.

348
00:48:20,316 --> 00:48:26,406
You have reactivated
my emotion chip. Why?.

349
00:48:26,656 --> 00:48:32,203
- Don`t be frightened.
- I am not frightened.

350
00:48:38,543 --> 00:48:45,508
- Do you know what this is?
- It would appear to be organic skin.

351
00:48:45,759 --> 00:48:51,598
What a cold description
for such a beautiful gift.

352
00:49:06,279 --> 00:49:09,824
Was that good for you?

353
00:49:17,165 --> 00:49:19,709
- How big is this Federation?
- Over 150 planets.

354
00:49:19,959 --> 00:49:24,089
- They span 8,000 light years.
- You mustn`t get home much.

355
00:49:24,339 --> 00:49:29,969
I tend to think of this ship as home.
I get back to Earth whenever I can.

356
00:49:31,971 --> 00:49:37,060
- They haven`t broken the code yet.
- Who? The zombies?

357
00:49:37,310 --> 00:49:41,314
- The Borg.
- It sounds Swedish.

358
00:49:46,695 --> 00:49:54,035
- How big is this ship?
- 24 decks. 700 metres long.

359
00:49:54,285 --> 00:50:01,543
It took me six months to find enough
titanium just to build a cockpit.

360
00:50:05,255 --> 00:50:08,550
How much did this thing cost?

361
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:12,804
The economics of the future
are somewhat different.

362
00:50:13,054 --> 00:50:17,475
Money doesn`t exist
in the 24th century.

363
00:50:17,726 --> 00:50:21,229
No money?.
You mean you don`t get paid?

364
00:50:21,479 --> 00:50:26,818
The acquisition of wealth is no
longer the driving force in our lives.

365
00:50:27,027 --> 00:50:30,238
We work to better ourselves ...

366
00:50:30,488 --> 00:50:33,616
... and the rest of humanity.

367
00:50:35,910 --> 00:50:40,623
Actually, we`re rather like
yourself and Dr Cochrane.

368
00:50:42,125 --> 00:50:45,211
All right!

369
00:50:45,462 --> 00:50:49,924
- Come on.
- Is there another way around?

370
00:50:51,384 --> 00:50:54,804
I know what l`m doing.

371
00:51:02,645 --> 00:51:05,940
Definitely not Swedish.

372
00:51:37,222 --> 00:51:40,266
What the hell are you doing?

373
00:51:51,778 --> 00:51:54,572
Perhaps something in satin.

374
00:52:03,039 --> 00:52:08,753
I`m sorry, but we`re closing,
and we have a strict dress code.

375
00:52:09,004 --> 00:52:12,590
If you boys don`t leave ...

376
00:52:14,968 --> 00:52:19,764
- I`m looking for Nicky the Nose.
- He hasn`t been here in months.

377
00:52:23,685 --> 00:52:26,521
This is the wrong chapter.

378
00:52:27,731 --> 00:52:31,609
Computer, begin chapter 13.

379
00:52:35,613 --> 00:52:39,367
Try and look
as if you`re having a good time.

380
00:52:52,088 --> 00:52:55,508
No, look at me.
Try to act naturally.

381
00:53:00,764 --> 00:53:03,683
There he is.

382
00:53:12,692 --> 00:53:18,490
- Ruby, this is not a good time.
- It`s never the time for us, Dix.

383
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:23,161
- Is that a case you`re working on?
- I`ll see you later.

384
00:53:23,411 --> 00:53:27,999
Okay, but watch your caboose
and dump the broad.

385
00:53:35,465 --> 00:53:39,010
Look what the cat dragged in.
What`s shakin`, Dix?.

386
00:53:39,260 --> 00:53:42,555
The usual, martinis and skirts.
Excuse me.

387
00:53:45,975 --> 00:53:50,021
- I`m going to take that personal.
- No offence.

388
00:53:50,271 --> 00:53:52,857
Hey!

389
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:21,928
I think you got him.

390
00:54:25,598 --> 00:54:30,020
I don`t get it. I thought
you said this was a hologram.

391
00:54:30,270 --> 00:54:36,401
I disengaged the safety protocols,
so even a holographic bullet can kill.

392
00:54:36,651 --> 00:54:41,656
- What are you doing?
- Looking for the neural processor.

393
00:54:41,906 --> 00:54:45,201
It`s like a memory chip.

394
00:54:45,452 --> 00:54:50,707
It will contain a record of all the
instructions this Borg has received.

395
00:54:50,957 --> 00:54:58,214
- It`s one of your uniforms.
- Yes, this was Ensign Lynch.

396
00:55:00,216 --> 00:55:02,594
Tough luck, huh?

397
00:55:05,096 --> 00:55:08,224
I`ve got to get to the bridge.

398
00:55:35,877 --> 00:55:38,838
- Doctor ...
- Yeah?

399
00:55:39,089 --> 00:55:44,511
- Would you take a look at this?
- Yeah.

400
00:55:44,761 --> 00:55:52,060
I`ve constructed the intermix chamber
from what I remember in school.

401
00:55:52,310 --> 00:55:56,022
- You learned about this in school?
- Yeah.

402
00:55:56,272 --> 00:56:03,029
``Basic Warp Design`` is required
reading. You`re the first chapter.

403
00:56:05,573 --> 00:56:08,827
Well, it looks like you got it right.

404
00:56:09,077 --> 00:56:15,208
This is what we`re using to replace
the damaged plasma conduit.

405
00:56:22,424 --> 00:56:28,930
Yes, but you need to reinforce
the tubing with a nano-polymer.

406
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:34,310
Dr Cochrane, I know this sounds
silly, but can I shake your hand?

407
00:56:36,938 --> 00:56:40,734
It`s such an honour to work with you.

408
00:56:40,984 --> 00:56:45,321
I never imagined l`d meet
the man who invented warp drive.

409
00:56:45,572 --> 00:56:48,908
I`m sorry ... Thanks.

410
00:56:56,374 --> 00:57:02,589
- Do they have to keep doing that?
- It`s just a little hero worship.

411
00:57:02,839 --> 00:57:07,469
I can`t say I blame them.
We all grew up hearing about you.

412
00:57:07,719 --> 00:57:12,390
Or, what you`re aboutto do.
I shouldn`t say this, -

413
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:15,977
- but I went
to Zefram Cochrane High School.

414
00:57:16,227 --> 00:57:19,147
Really?.

415
00:57:21,733 --> 00:57:27,864
- I wish I had a picture of this.
- What?

416
00:57:28,114 --> 00:57:33,036
In the future, this whole area
becomes an historical monument.

417
00:57:33,286 --> 00:57:38,249
You`re standing on the exact spot
where your statue is going to be.

418
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:40,752
Statue?

419
00:57:41,002 --> 00:57:46,383
It`s marble, about 20 metres tall.
You`re looking up at the sky.

420
00:57:46,633 --> 00:57:50,804
Your hand
is reaching toward the future.

421
00:57:51,054 --> 00:57:54,391
I`ve got to take a leak.

422
00:57:54,641 --> 00:57:59,229
Leak?. I`m not detecting any leak.

423
00:57:59,479 --> 00:58:03,024
Don`t you people
from the 24th century ever pee?

424
00:58:03,274 --> 00:58:06,695
Oh, leak! I get it.

425
00:58:06,945 --> 00:58:12,909
- That`s pretty funny.
- Excuse me.

426
00:58:13,159 --> 00:58:16,079
Commander ...

427
00:58:23,670 --> 00:58:27,799
Reports of my assimilation
are greatly exaggerated.

428
00:58:28,049 --> 00:58:32,220
I found something you lost.

429
00:58:33,972 --> 00:58:38,727
- I am a Klingon.
- Mr Worf, report.

430
00:58:38,977 --> 00:58:45,316
The Borg control over half the ship.
There`s no power to the bridge.

431
00:58:45,567 --> 00:58:50,697
I`ve accessed
a Borg neural processor.

432
00:58:50,947 --> 00:58:55,660
They`re transforming the deflector
dish into an interplexing beacon -

433
00:58:55,910 --> 00:59:01,833
- to establish a link with the Borg
living in the 21st century.

434
00:59:02,083 --> 00:59:05,337
But the Borg
are still in the Delta Quadrant.

435
00:59:05,587 --> 00:59:12,052
They`ll send reinforcements.
Humanity will be an easy target.

436
00:59:12,302 --> 00:59:15,347
We must destroy the deflector dish.

437
00:59:15,597 --> 00:59:20,185
We can`t get to deflector control
or a shuttle craft ...

438
00:59:22,312 --> 00:59:26,608
Mr Worf, do you remember
your zero-G combat training?

439
00:59:26,858 --> 00:59:30,904
I remember it made me
sick to my stomach.

440
00:59:32,197 --> 00:59:36,659
- What are you suggesting?
- It`s time we took a little stroll.

441
00:59:42,165 --> 00:59:45,960
There`s a humanoid life-sign
up ahead.

442
00:59:46,211 --> 00:59:49,255
51 1 metres.

443
00:59:57,097 --> 00:59:59,432
Cochrane?

444
01:00:00,975 --> 01:00:03,395
It`s him, all right.

445
01:00:14,698 --> 01:00:20,662
I`ve re-modulated the weapons,
but the Borg will be quick to adapt.

446
01:00:20,912 --> 01:00:24,249
We must make every shot count.

447
01:00:27,002 --> 01:00:29,587
Magnetise.

448
01:00:33,383 --> 01:00:36,469
- Watch your caboose, Dix.
- I intend to.

449
01:00:58,450 --> 01:01:03,079
- How are you doing, Worf?
- Not well, sir.

450
01:01:03,329 --> 01:01:08,084
Try not to look at the stars.
Keep your eyes on the hull.

451
01:01:11,921 --> 01:01:14,674
Let`s go.

452
01:01:37,947 --> 01:01:41,826
Tell me, are you using
a polymer-based neuro-rely -

453
01:01:42,077 --> 01:01:47,499
- to transmit organic nerve impulses
to my positronic net?

454
01:01:47,749 --> 01:01:54,214
If so, how have you solved
the problem of signal degradation?

455
01:01:54,464 --> 01:01:57,842
Do you always talk this much?

456
01:01:58,093 --> 01:02:01,179
Not always, but often.

457
01:02:01,429 --> 01:02:05,517
Why do you insist
on using this primitive language?

458
01:02:05,767 --> 01:02:09,771
Your android brain
is capable of much more.

459
01:02:10,021 --> 01:02:13,066
I am trying to become more human.

460
01:02:13,358 --> 01:02:19,698
We used to be just like them.
Flawed, weak, organic.

461
01:02:19,948 --> 01:02:26,204
We evolved to include the synthetic.
We use both to attain perfection.

462
01:02:26,454 --> 01:02:30,583
Your goal
should be the same as ours.

463
01:02:31,751 --> 01:02:37,507
Believing oneself to be perfect is
often the sign of a delusional mind.

464
01:02:37,757 --> 01:02:42,220
A small being, trying to attack
what he doesn`t understand.

465
01:02:42,470 --> 01:02:45,640
You have no real interest in me.

466
01:02:45,890 --> 01:02:49,936
Your goal is to obtain
the codes for the computer.

467
01:02:50,186 --> 01:02:54,441
That is one of our goals,
one of many.

468
01:02:55,984 --> 01:02:59,446
And to reach it,
l`m willing to help you reach yours.

469
01:03:24,971 --> 01:03:27,974
Is it becoming clear to you yet?

470
01:03:28,224 --> 01:03:34,230
Look at you, standing there cradling
the new flesh l`ve given you.

471
01:03:34,481 --> 01:03:38,443
If it means nothing to you,
why protect it?

472
01:03:38,693 --> 01:03:43,156
I am simply imitating
the behaviour of humans.

473
01:03:43,406 --> 01:03:47,619
You`re becoming more human all the
time. Now you`re learning how to lie.

474
01:03:49,913 --> 01:03:55,460
My programming was not designed
to process these sensations.

475
01:03:55,710 --> 01:03:59,798
Then tear away your skin
as you would a defective circuit.

476
01:04:03,134 --> 01:04:06,346
Go ahead, Data. We won`t stop you.

477
01:04:11,851 --> 01:04:15,146
Do it. Don`t be tempted by flesh.

478
01:04:26,074 --> 01:04:30,662
Are you familiar with
physical forms of pleasure?

479
01:04:30,912 --> 01:04:37,794
If you are referring to ... sexuality, -

480
01:04:38,044 --> 01:04:41,047
- I am fully functional.

481
01:04:42,590 --> 01:04:46,803
Programmed in multiple techniques.

482
01:04:47,053 --> 01:04:50,515
How long has it been
since you`ve used them?

483
01:04:50,765 --> 01:04:55,687
8 years, 7 months,
16 days, 4 minutes ...

484
01:04:55,937 --> 01:04:59,107
Far too long.

485
01:05:28,053 --> 01:05:32,098
- We should bring reinforcements.
- There`s no time.

486
01:05:32,349 --> 01:05:39,439
They`re building it on top of the particle
emitter. It will soon be activated.

487
01:05:39,689 --> 01:05:44,861
- With phasers on full power ...
- The dish is charged with anti-protons.

488
01:05:45,111 --> 01:05:49,699
It`d destroy half the ship.
We have to find another way.

489
01:06:09,678 --> 01:06:11,971
Doctor!

490
01:06:16,101 --> 01:06:20,188
- Still looking for the bathroom?
- I`m not going back.

491
01:06:20,438 --> 01:06:24,567
- We can`t do this without you.
- I don`t want to be a statue.

492
01:06:24,818 --> 01:06:29,280
- Stay away from me.
- We don`t have time for this.

493
01:06:46,214 --> 01:06:49,259
You told him about the statue?

494
01:06:51,052 --> 01:06:55,682
For this to work, all three maglocks
will have to be released.

495
01:09:06,146 --> 01:09:09,566
The magnetic restrictors
are disengaged.

496
01:09:11,317 --> 01:09:13,987
They`ve adapted.

497
01:10:11,044 --> 01:10:15,757
Warning:
Decompression in 45 seconds.

498
01:10:39,864 --> 01:10:42,992
Hawk!

499
01:13:16,771 --> 01:13:19,816
We`ve had a change of plans, Data.

500
01:13:30,702 --> 01:13:34,039
Assimilate this.

501
01:14:02,067 --> 01:14:06,446
- An hour to go. How are you?
- I`ve got a hangover.

502
01:14:06,696 --> 01:14:11,868
Either from the whisky
or your laser beam ... or both.

503
01:14:12,118 --> 01:14:14,788
But l`m ready to make history.

504
01:14:14,996 --> 01:14:17,207
Troi to Riker.

505
01:14:17,457 --> 01:14:21,795
We`re ready to open the launch door.

506
01:14:33,848 --> 01:14:39,396
- Look at that.
- Is there no moon in the future?

507
01:14:39,646 --> 01:14:45,318
Sure, but there are
50 million people living on it.

508
01:14:45,568 --> 01:14:51,950
You can even see Tycho City
and Lake Armstrong on a clear day.

509
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:56,871
Please ...
don`t tell me it`s all thanks to me.

510
01:14:57,122 --> 01:15:03,003
I`ve heard enough about
the great Zefram Cochrane.

511
01:15:03,253 --> 01:15:07,924
You people have got some
pretty funny ideas about me.

512
01:15:08,174 --> 01:15:12,220
You all look at me
as if l`m a saint or a visionary.

513
01:15:12,470 --> 01:15:18,852
You`re no saint, but you did
have a vision. We`re sitting in it.

514
01:15:19,102 --> 01:15:25,692
You want to know what my vision is?
Dollar signs! Money!

515
01:15:25,942 --> 01:15:30,864
I didn`t build this ship
to usher in a new era for humanity.

516
01:15:31,114 --> 01:15:35,952
You think I want to go to the stars?
I don`t even like to fly. I take trains.

517
01:15:37,537 --> 01:15:42,375
I built this ship so that I could
retire to some tropical island, -

518
01:15:42,625 --> 01:15:46,129
- filled with naked women.

519
01:15:46,379 --> 01:15:50,884
That`s Zefram Cochrane.
That`s his vision.

520
01:15:51,134 --> 01:15:56,306
This historical figure
you keep talking about ...

521
01:15:56,556 --> 01:16:01,811
I never met him.
I can`t imagine I ever will.

522
01:16:02,062 --> 01:16:06,900
Someone once said: ``Don`t try
to be a great man, just be a man.``

523
01:16:07,150 --> 01:16:13,031
- ``Let history be the judge.``
- Rhetorical nonsense.

524
01:16:13,281 --> 01:16:18,328
- Who said that?
- You did, ten years from now.

525
01:16:18,578 --> 01:16:20,997
You`ve got 58 minutes, Doc.
Get on the checklist.

526
01:16:23,667 --> 01:16:29,631
They`re on the move again.
They`ve taken decks 5 and 6.

527
01:16:29,881 --> 01:16:37,305
- They`ve adapted to our weapons.
- We`ll have to further modify them.

528
01:16:37,555 --> 01:16:41,518
In the meantime,
tell your men to stand their ground.

529
01:16:41,768 --> 01:16:46,690
- Fight hand-to-hand if they have to.
- Aye, sir.

530
01:16:49,359 --> 01:16:52,821
Wait.
Captain, our weapons are useless.

531
01:16:53,071 --> 01:16:58,284
We must activate the auto-destruct
and evacuate the ship.

532
01:16:58,535 --> 01:17:02,455
If we destroy the ship,
we destroy the Borg.

533
01:17:02,706 --> 01:17:07,168
- We`re going to stay and fight.
- We have lost the Enterprise.

534
01:17:07,419 --> 01:17:11,506
We have not lost the Enterprise
and we are not going to.

535
01:17:11,756 --> 01:17:15,719
- Not while l`m in command.
- I must object ...

536
01:17:15,969 --> 01:17:19,639
- Your objection is noted.
- With all due respect ...

537
01:17:19,889 --> 01:17:24,352
You`re allowing personal experience
to influence yourjudgement.

538
01:17:26,771 --> 01:17:29,274
You`re afraid.

539
01:17:29,524 --> 01:17:34,904
You want to destroy the ship
and run away. You coward.

540
01:17:35,155 --> 01:17:39,242
If you were any other man,
I would kill you where you stand.

541
01:17:39,492 --> 01:17:42,954
Get off my bridge.

542
01:17:55,633 --> 01:17:58,678
- What now?.
- Carry out his orders.

543
01:17:58,928 --> 01:18:02,724
Dyson, Kaplan,
modify the weapons system.

544
01:18:02,974 --> 01:18:08,063
- We should get off this ship.
- The captain has made up his mind.

545
01:18:12,442 --> 01:18:16,237
- You son of a bitch!
- This isn`t the time.

546
01:18:16,488 --> 01:18:22,410
I know nothing about the future,
but everyone thinks this is suicide.

547
01:18:22,660 --> 01:18:27,457
- They`re just afraid to say it.
- The crew will follow my orders.

548
01:18:27,707 --> 01:18:33,880
- Even if they don`t make sense?
- They don`t know the Borg as I do.

549
01:18:34,130 --> 01:18:39,719
- No one does. No one can.
- What is that supposed to mean?

550
01:18:44,683 --> 01:18:50,146
Six years ago, they assimilated me
into their collective.

551
01:18:51,398 --> 01:18:55,485
I had the cybernetic devices
implanted throughout my body.

552
01:18:55,735 --> 01:19:02,075
I was linked to the hive,
every trace of individuality erased.

553
01:19:02,325 --> 01:19:04,994
I was one of them.

554
01:19:05,203 --> 01:19:10,792
I have a unique perspective on Borg
and I know how to fight them.

555
01:19:11,042 --> 01:19:15,005
If you will excuse me,
I have work to do.

556
01:19:15,255 --> 01:19:22,470
I am such an idiot ...
It`s so simple.

557
01:19:22,721 --> 01:19:26,808
The Borg hurt you, and now
you`re going to hurt them back.

558
01:19:27,058 --> 01:19:31,354
In my century we have
a higher sensibility than revenge.

559
01:19:31,604 --> 01:19:35,692
Bullshit! I saw the look on your
face when we were on the Holodeck.

560
01:19:35,942 --> 01:19:42,449
- You were enjoying it.
- How dare you!

561
01:19:42,699 --> 01:19:48,538
You`re not the first man to get
a thrill from murdering someone.

562
01:19:48,788 --> 01:19:51,875
- Get out!
- Or what? You`ll kill me?

563
01:19:52,125 --> 01:19:56,713
- Like you killed Ensign Lynch?
- There was no way to save him.

564
01:19:56,963 --> 01:20:01,885
- Where was your sensibility then?
- I don`t have time for this.

565
01:20:02,135 --> 01:20:05,305
I didn`t mean to interrupt your quest.

566
01:20:05,555 --> 01:20:09,851
Capt Ahab has to go hunt his whale.

567
01:20:11,061 --> 01:20:15,023
- What?
- You do have books in the future?

568
01:20:16,608 --> 01:20:20,153
This is about saving humanity.

569
01:20:20,403 --> 01:20:25,075
- Blow up the damn ship!
- No!

570
01:20:38,797 --> 01:20:42,008
I will not sacrifice the Enterprise.

571
01:20:42,258 --> 01:20:46,638
We`ve made
too many compromises already.

572
01:20:46,888 --> 01:20:51,434
They invade our space,
and we fall back.

573
01:20:51,685 --> 01:20:55,563
They assimilate entire worlds,
and we fall back.

574
01:20:55,814 --> 01:21:00,902
Not again. The line must be drawn here.
This far and no further.

575
01:21:02,529 --> 01:21:07,909
And I will make them pay
for what they`ve done.

576
01:21:33,601 --> 01:21:36,855
You broke your little ships.

577
01:21:46,614 --> 01:21:49,534
See you around, Ahab.

578
01:21:51,828 --> 01:21:55,331
``And he piled upon
the whale`s white hump -

579
01:21:55,582 --> 01:22:00,462
- a sum of all the rage and hate
felt by his whole race.``

580
01:22:00,712 --> 01:22:05,967
``lf his chest had been a cannon, he
would have shot his heart upon it.``

581
01:22:06,217 --> 01:22:09,179
What?

582
01:22:10,805 --> 01:22:16,144
- ``Moby Dick`.
- Actually, I never read it.

583
01:22:21,566 --> 01:22:27,530
Ahab spent years hunting
the white whale that crippled him.

584
01:22:27,781 --> 01:22:35,121
A quest for vengeance.
But in the end it destroyed him -

585
01:22:35,372 --> 01:22:38,416
- and his ship.

586
01:22:39,793 --> 01:22:42,545
I guess he didn`t know when to quit.

587
01:23:06,194 --> 01:23:09,531
Prepare to evacuate the Enterprise.

588
01:23:32,595 --> 01:23:35,557
- ATR setting?
- Active.

589
01:23:35,807 --> 01:23:40,603
Main bus.
Initiate pre-ignition sequence.

590
01:23:40,854 --> 01:23:45,692
Begin auto-destruct sequence.
Authorisation: Picard 47-AT.

591
01:23:45,942 --> 01:23:51,906
Confirm auto-destruct sequence.
Crusher 22-BC.

592
01:23:52,157 --> 01:23:59,205
Confirm auto-destruct sequence.
Authorisation: Worf 37-GE.

593
01:23:59,456 --> 01:24:04,461
Command authorisation accepted.
Awaiting final code.

594
01:24:04,711 --> 01:24:10,508
Destruct sequence A-1 .
15 minutes silent countdown.

595
01:24:14,054 --> 01:24:18,183
- Enable.
- Self-destructin 15 minutes.

596
01:24:18,433 --> 01:24:21,311
There willbe no audio warning.

597
01:24:21,561 --> 01:24:27,233
- So much for the Enterprise E.
- We barely knew her.

598
01:24:27,484 --> 01:24:30,445
Do you think they`ll build a new one?

599
01:24:30,695 --> 01:24:34,783
There are plenty of letters left
in the alphabet.

600
01:24:35,033 --> 01:24:37,577
Mr Worf ...

601
01:24:42,123 --> 01:24:46,503
- I regret some of the things I said.
- Some?

602
01:24:46,753 --> 01:24:53,051
As a matter of fact, I think you`re
the bravest man l`ve ever known.

603
01:24:54,803 --> 01:24:58,181
Thank you, sir.

604
01:24:58,431 --> 01:25:01,768
See you on Gravett lsland.

605
01:25:25,875 --> 01:25:28,294
Captain.

606
01:25:32,590 --> 01:25:33,466
Data.

607
01:25:36,136 --> 01:25:38,972
Control to Phoenix,
final launch checks are complete.

608
01:25:39,222 --> 01:25:42,934
- Good luck.
- Everybody ready to make history?.

609
01:25:43,184 --> 01:25:49,024
I think I forgot something.
It`s probably nothing.

610
01:25:49,274 --> 01:25:52,694
Begin ignition sequence.

611
01:25:56,448 --> 01:26:01,786
God! Now I remember!
Where is it?

612
01:26:02,037 --> 01:26:07,542
We can`t lift off without it.
No, wait. I`ve found it.

613
01:26:08,585 --> 01:26:11,838
Ten, nine, eight ...

614
01:26:12,088 --> 01:26:15,592
Let`s rock `n` roll!

615
01:26:45,288 --> 01:26:48,625
Can you turn that down a little?

616
01:26:48,875 --> 01:26:53,672
We`ve got a red light
on the second intake valve.

617
01:26:57,842 --> 01:27:02,722
Ignore it. We`ll be fine.

618
01:27:02,972 --> 01:27:05,975
Shutdown and separation
on my mark.

619
01:27:06,226 --> 01:27:10,814
Three, two, one ... mark.

620
01:27:26,830 --> 01:27:30,083
Let`s bring the warp core on line.

621
01:27:34,671 --> 01:27:38,842
- Wow!
- You ain`t seen nothing yet.

622
01:27:40,927 --> 01:27:45,140
If you see any of my crew,
give them this.

623
01:27:45,390 --> 01:27:50,228
Orders to live a quite corner of America
and stay out of history`s way.

624
01:27:50,478 --> 01:27:55,275
- Good luck.
- To both of us.

625
01:27:58,987 --> 01:28:02,532
You`re not leaving, are you?

626
01:28:02,782 --> 01:28:07,704
When I was captured, my crew
risked everything to save me.

627
01:28:07,954 --> 01:28:14,544
There is someone still on this ship,
and I owe him the same.

628
01:28:19,632 --> 01:28:22,927
Go and find your friend.

629
01:29:53,643 --> 01:29:57,647
What`s wrong, Locutus?
lsn`t this familiar?.

630
01:29:57,897 --> 01:30:01,860
Organic minds
are such fragile things.

631
01:30:02,110 --> 01:30:07,032
How could you forget me so quickly?.
We were very close, you and l.

632
01:30:08,658 --> 01:30:11,870
You can still hear our song.

633
01:30:12,120 --> 01:30:17,292
Yes ... I remember you.

634
01:30:17,542 --> 01:30:21,421
You were there all the time.

635
01:30:21,671 --> 01:30:27,552
But that ship and all the Borg on it
were destroyed.

636
01:30:27,802 --> 01:30:31,598
You think in such
three-dimensional terms.

637
01:30:31,848 --> 01:30:35,643
How small you`ve become.
Data understands me.

638
01:30:37,645 --> 01:30:44,819
- Don`t you, Data?
- What have you done to him?

639
01:30:45,070 --> 01:30:49,783
Given him what he always wanted,
flesh and blood.

640
01:30:50,033 --> 01:30:54,412
Let him go.
He`s not the one you want.

641
01:30:54,662 --> 01:31:01,294
- Are you offering yourself to us?
- Offering myself?

642
01:31:03,088 --> 01:31:06,925
That`s it! I remember now.

643
01:31:07,175 --> 01:31:11,137
It wasn`t enough
that you assimilated me.

644
01:31:11,388 --> 01:31:17,102
I had to give myself freely
to the Borg ... to you.

645
01:31:17,352 --> 01:31:21,856
I`ve overseen the assimilation
of millions. You were no different.

646
01:31:22,107 --> 01:31:26,277
You`re lying. You wanted more
than just another Borg drone.

647
01:31:26,528 --> 01:31:32,367
You wanted a human being, a bridge
between humanity and the Borg.

648
01:31:32,617 --> 01:31:37,038
You wanted a counterpart,
but I resisted. I fought you.

649
01:31:37,288 --> 01:31:40,917
You can`t begin to imagine
the life you denied yourself.

650
01:31:45,922 --> 01:31:48,925
It`s not too late.

651
01:31:50,719 --> 01:31:55,140
Locutus could still be with you,
just in the way you wanted.

652
01:31:55,390 --> 01:31:58,059
An equal.

653
01:31:58,309 --> 01:32:02,605
Let Data go, and
I will take my place at your side, -

654
01:32:02,856 --> 01:32:06,609
- willingly, without resistance.

655
01:32:06,860 --> 01:32:10,155
Such a noble creature.

656
01:32:10,405 --> 01:32:14,075
A quality we sometimes lack.

657
01:32:14,325 --> 01:32:18,788
We will add your distinctiveness
to our own.

658
01:32:19,039 --> 01:32:22,584
Welcome home, Locutus.

659
01:32:28,214 --> 01:32:31,926
Data, you are free to go.

660
01:32:32,177 --> 01:32:35,305
- Data, go.
- No.

661
01:32:37,891 --> 01:32:43,855
- I do not wish to go.
- I have already found an equal.

662
01:32:44,105 --> 01:32:48,026
Data, deactivate
the self-destruct sequence.

663
01:32:49,736 --> 01:32:52,781
Data, no! Don`t do it!

664
01:32:53,823 --> 01:32:56,826
Data, listen to me ...

665
01:32:57,077 --> 01:33:00,955
Auto-destruct deactivated.

666
01:33:03,833 --> 01:33:08,922
Now enter the encryption codes
and give me computer control.

667
01:33:09,172 --> 01:33:11,675
Data!

668
01:33:13,343 --> 01:33:16,346
Data ...

669
01:33:24,437 --> 01:33:27,482
He will make an excellent drone.

670
01:33:35,448 --> 01:33:41,579
Plasma injectors on-line. Everything
is looking good. I think we`re ready.

671
01:33:41,830 --> 01:33:47,502
We must break the warp barrier in the
next five minutes to get their attention.

672
01:33:47,752 --> 01:33:52,132
- Main cells are charged and ready.
- Let`s do it.

673
01:33:52,382 --> 01:33:55,218
Engage.

674
01:34:03,435 --> 01:34:08,857
Warp field is looking good.
Structural integrity is holding.

675
01:34:09,107 --> 01:34:14,070
Speed:
20,000 kilometres per second.

676
01:34:17,115 --> 01:34:19,117
Sweet Jesus!

677
01:34:22,328 --> 01:34:26,124
Relax, they`re just here
to give us a send off.

678
01:34:30,545 --> 01:34:34,007
I am bringing
the external sensors on-line.

679
01:34:40,847 --> 01:34:44,142
30 seconds to warp threshold.

680
01:34:53,777 --> 01:34:58,448
- Approaching light speed.
- We`re at critical velocity.

681
01:34:58,698 --> 01:35:01,743
- Quantum torpedoes locked.
- Destroy them.

682
01:35:09,918 --> 01:35:13,171
Watch your future`s end.

683
01:35:30,647 --> 01:35:35,193
- Data!
- Resistance is futile.

684
01:37:01,905 --> 01:37:05,158
That should be enough.
Take us out of warp.

685
01:37:17,128 --> 01:37:22,550
- Is that Earth?
- That`s it.

686
01:37:22,801 --> 01:37:26,096
- It`s so small.
- It`s about to get a whole lot bigger.

687
01:38:49,721 --> 01:38:55,185
- Captain.
- Data, are you all right?

688
01:38:55,435 --> 01:39:02,776
I would imagine
I look worse than I ... feel.

689
01:39:09,074 --> 01:39:11,785
Strange ...

690
01:39:12,035 --> 01:39:16,164
Part of me is sorry she is dead.

691
01:39:18,958 --> 01:39:21,795
She was unique.

692
01:39:22,045 --> 01:39:27,092
She brought me closer to humanity
than I ever thought possible.

693
01:39:27,342 --> 01:39:31,805
And for a time,
I was tempted by her offer.

694
01:39:34,057 --> 01:39:38,186
How long a time?

695
01:39:38,436 --> 01:39:42,357
0.68 seconds, sir.

696
01:39:42,607 --> 01:39:47,737
For an android,
that is nearly an eternity.

697
01:40:00,375 --> 01:40:04,462
Captain`s log, April 5th, 2063.

698
01:40:04,713 --> 01:40:09,009
The voyage ofthe Phoenix
was a success ... again.

699
01:40:09,259 --> 01:40:12,178
The warp flight was detected, -

700
01:40:12,429 --> 01:40:17,559
- and the alien ship is on its way
to rendezvous with history.

701
01:41:28,963 --> 01:41:33,009
My God!
They`re really from another world.

702
01:41:33,259 --> 01:41:38,515
And they`re going to want to meet
the man who flew that warp ship.

703
01:42:28,148 --> 01:42:30,734
Live long and prosper.

704
01:42:51,713 --> 01:42:55,133
Thanks.

705
01:42:57,844 --> 01:43:02,057
I think it`s time
we made a discreet exit.

706
01:43:02,307 --> 01:43:04,976
Stand by to beam us up.

707
01:43:12,692 --> 01:43:15,987
You`ve got to go.

708
01:43:18,490 --> 01:43:23,036
I envy you.
The world you`re going to.

709
01:43:24,704 --> 01:43:30,543
I envy you. Taking these first steps
into a new frontier.

710
01:43:32,921 --> 01:43:36,424
I shall miss you, Lily.

711
01:43:50,063 --> 01:43:53,566
Picard to Enterprise, energise.

712
01:44:01,408 --> 01:44:06,329
The moon obscured our presence.
The Vulcans did not detect us.

713
01:44:06,579 --> 01:44:11,543
I`ve reconfigured the chronometric
readings from the Borg sphere.

714
01:44:11,793 --> 01:44:15,463
- All decks report ready.
- Helm standing by.

715
01:44:15,714 --> 01:44:21,302
Lay in a course for the 24th century.
Our future is waiting for us.

716
01:44:21,553 --> 01:44:26,975
- Course laid in, sir.
- Make it so.

717
01:50:26,918 --> 01:50:31,840
