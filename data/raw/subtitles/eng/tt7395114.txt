1
00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:04,583
<i>If you asked most people</i>
<i>where Knockemstiff, Ohio</i>

2
00:01:04,666 --> 00:01:06,750
<i>or Coal Creek, West Virginia were,</i>

3
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:09,458
<i>they probably couldn't point 'em out
to you on a map.</i>

4
00:01:11,458 --> 00:01:14,125
<i>But I guarantee,
they'd be there all the same.</i>

5
00:01:17,083 --> 00:01:21,625
<i>How and why so many people
from those two piddlin' places on that map</i>

6
00:01:21,708 --> 00:01:25,000
<i>could end up connected
has a lot to do with our story.</i>

7
00:01:26,625 --> 00:01:28,833
<i>Some would claim it was just dumb luck,</i>

8
00:01:28,916 --> 00:01:31,416
<i>while others might swear
it was God's intention.</i>

9
00:01:32,083 --> 00:01:35,416
<i>But I'd say
with the way things turned out,</i>

10
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,916
<i>it was a little bit of both.</i>

11
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:43,458
<i>In 1957, it'd take someone
approximately ten hours</i>

12
00:01:43,541 --> 00:01:46,125
<i>to drive from Coal Creek
to a paper mill town</i>

13
00:01:46,208 --> 00:01:48,208
<i>in southern Ohio called Meade.</i>

14
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:53,291
<i>Once you got to Meade,
Knockemstiff was only a short drive away.</i>

15
00:02:02,125 --> 00:02:04,750
<i>Four hundred or so people
lived in Knockemstiff</i>

16
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,541
<i>in 1957,</i>

17
00:02:06,916 --> 00:02:11,875
<i>nearly all of them connected by blood
by one godforsaken calamity or another,</i>

18
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:15,750
<i>be it lust or necessity
or just plain ignorance.</i>

19
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:25,125
<i>The Russells had rented the house on top
of the Mitchell flats for nine years now.</i>

20
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:29,416
<i>But most of the neighbors down below
still considered them outsiders.</i>

21
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:35,916
Hey, Dad.

22
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:41,791
You're coming with me today, boy.

23
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:44,833
<i>Years ago,</i>
<i>Willard had fitted together</i>

24
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:47,208
<i>a weathered cross above a fallen tree</i>

25
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:50,000
<i>in a small clearing behind his house.</i>

26
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,041
<i>He came every morning and evening
to talk to God.</i>

27
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:58,458
<i>It seemed to his son that his father
fought the Devil all the time.</i>

28
00:02:58,541 --> 00:03:00,708
Now, you pray on...

29
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:02,791
what happened today.

30
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:05,208
Now, remember, be honest.

31
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,625
No bullshittin', he'll know.

32
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:11,125
<i>When he prayed,</i>

33
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:15,041
<i>his mind would often drift back
to the war in the South Pacific</i>

34
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:18,750
<i>and the day that he and a couple
of other soldiers came across the body</i>

35
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:21,333
<i>of Gunnery Sergeant Miller Jones.</i>

36
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,041
Holy shit.

37
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:55,500
Fuck.

38
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:01,916
What's it say?

39
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,583
Miller Jones.

40
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:06,541
Fuck!

41
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:11,416
We gotta do something.
The Japs just left him up there.

42
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:29,125
Next stop, Meade, Ohio.

43
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,791
- Please.
- Thank you.

44
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:57,750
<i>Right before Willard fell in love,</i>

45
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,333
<i>the man whose seat he took
would also meet his match.</i>

46
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,625
I'm so sorry. I forgot my damn keys.

47
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:05,333
Okay. Guy by the window counter.

48
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,375
So, what'll you be having?

49
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,708
Ham and cheese.

50
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:17,916
Ham and cheese.

51
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:20,708
- Okay.
- You're a little green on the job.

52
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:22,500
That obvious, huh?

53
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:24,458
My brother just got me the job, so...

54
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,708
Ham and cheese.

55
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:30,083
You take pictures?

56
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:33,750
<i>In the years to come,</i>
<i>Carl would call Sandy "the bait,"</i>

57
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,583
<i>and she'd called him "the shooter."</i>

58
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:39,500
Only when I find a smile
pretty enough to photograph, that is.

59
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:41,750
<i>Both called</i>
<i>their victims "the models."</i>

60
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:43,000
I'll have to think about it.

61
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:45,583
What can I get ya?

62
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:48,500
Meatloaf is the blue plate special.

63
00:05:50,458 --> 00:05:53,458
Um... Just coffee and a doughnut.

64
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:08,208
Thank you.

65
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:09,750
- Looks really fine.
- No!

66
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:11,000
No!

67
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:13,416
- Get out. I told you last time.
- Come on, now.

68
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,916
Next time,
the cops will drag you out.

69
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,583
- Excuse me.
- Get out!

70
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:19,666
I'm just gonna take my break outside.

71
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,375
All right.

72
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,625
All right!

73
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,583
Thank you. God bless you.

74
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:47,875
Did you need anything else?

75
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:49,541
Um... No, I'm fine.

76
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,541
That was nice, what you did.

77
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,833
Some people just need a little help
once in a while.

78
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:04,416
You know what I mean?

79
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:07,250
Yep.

80
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:13,083
- Hmm.
- You back home from the war?

81
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:15,708
Nah, I'm just passing through.

82
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:18,250
On my way to West Virginia.

83
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:20,625
My people are from Coal Creek.

84
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:24,458
That's too bad.

85
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:27,291
You have a nice face.

86
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:36,625
Well...

87
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:38,958
It's nice to meet you.

88
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:43,250
It's nice to meet you, too.

89
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:53,916
Is it true
the Japs ate their own dead?

90
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,750
- Where'd you hear that?
- Read it in the paper.

91
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,833
- Lord, that's good stuff.
- Mm-hmm.

92
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:05,958
- I got three more in my kit.
- Yeah?

93
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:09,083
Yep. And I've got something else
for you, Uncle Earskell.

94
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:14,625
Now, this here is supposed to be the gun

95
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:17,875
that Hitler used to blow his brains out.

96
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:23,583
You still got
the bullshit in you, ain't you?

97
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:26,208
- You think that guy lied to me?
- Yeah.

98
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:29,416
That is a nice gift, though.

99
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,500
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

100
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,083
It's German.

101
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:34,458
That's a Luger.

102
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:44,500
Oh, come here! Oh...

103
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:48,000
Oh, Lord, I was so worried.

104
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:49,541
No...

105
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:51,583
It wasn't that bad.

106
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:54,208
It wasn't that bad, Mama.

107
00:08:57,583 --> 00:09:01,000
I would ask you to get down
and thank Jesus with me,

108
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,208
but I can smell the liquor on your breath.

109
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:05,416
I know.

110
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:07,958
I felt the need to celebrate.

111
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,166
I'm in love.

112
00:09:10,666 --> 00:09:12,958
What's this girl's name?

113
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:15,625
Well, I ain't never got her name.

114
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,875
Earskell.

115
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:20,291
You ain't got her name?

116
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,833
I left her a dollar tip, though.

117
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:25,000
A what?

118
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:26,541
For a cup of coffee?

119
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:29,083
Well, she won't forget that.

120
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:32,583
I know you like this waitress.

121
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:34,458
Oh, but there's a...

122
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:37,625
A girl from church I want you to meet.

123
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:40,291
I don't wanna go to church, Mama.

124
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:44,708
You get some rest.
You'll feel better in the morning.

125
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:50,583
<i>Though he couldn't look at a cross</i>

126
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:52,333
<i>without thinking of Miller Jones,</i>

127
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:54,833
<i>he never told anyone
about the crucified Marine.</i>

128
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:59,083
- Welcome.
<i>- Willard.</i>

129
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:01,958
Willard, I've asked Helen to sit with us.
Go on, Helen.

130
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:04,291
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi, how are you?

131
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:08,416
Willard just got back, Helen.

132
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,791
- You...
- Welcome home.

133
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:14,291
It's been four days.

134
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:17,208
<i>Willard didn't know</i>
<i>that Emma had promised God</i>

135
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:19,708
<i>that in exchange
for bringing him home safe,</i>

136
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:22,250
<i>she'd make sure he married Helen Hatton.</i>

137
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:25,958
<i>The girl's family burned up
in a house fire</i>

138
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:27,958
<i>leaving the poor thing all alone.</i>

139
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,958
Good gracious.

140
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:31,250
It's hot, ain't it?

141
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:33,458
- Amen.
- It's bound to get hotter.

142
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:36,250
Right now, we got two boys
from over in Topperville

143
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:38,708
- gonna lead the service today.
- All right.

144
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:41,375
And from what folks tell me,
they got a right good message.

145
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:44,208
So, let's bring 'em up.
Boys, come on up here.

146
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:47,000
- Let's make 'em feel welcome.
- Oh!

147
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,375
Welcome, boys. Welcome.

148
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:51,291
See that one in the wheelchair?

149
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:54,541
Drank too much strychnine or antifreeze,
or something is why he can't walk.

150
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:57,000
So good to see you. Thank you for coming.

151
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:58,750
Testing their fate, they call it.

152
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,583
It's going too far, the way I see it.

153
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:06,083
Thank you, Reverend.

154
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,958
My name is Roy Laferty,

155
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:12,666
and this here is my cousin, Theodore.

156
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:19,791
Now, the Holy Ghost is going to visit
this little church

157
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:21,958
that bears his sacred name!

158
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,083
Come on, Theodore!

159
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:12,916
Whoo!

160
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:17,833
What is it you're most afraid of?

161
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:19,625
Hmm?

162
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:23,208
Because if your worst fear is rats, well..

163
00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:27,250
Satan'll make sure
you get your fill of them. Mm.

164
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:30,291
- That's right, tell 'em, boy.
- Brothers and sisters...

165
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,208
you'll see them,

166
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:35,083
eating away at you whilst you lay there

167
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:37,125
unable to lift a single finger.

168
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:39,833
And it won't ever cease.

169
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:42,416
A million years

170
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,166
in eternity.

171
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:48,666
Now, don't even try and figure that up.

172
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,041
Come on, Lord.

173
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:53,666
Ain't no human head big enough
to calculate misery like that!

174
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,791
Yeah?

175
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:59,541
And really, brothers and sisters,
ain't no man ever been evil enough,

176
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:01,541
- not even that Hitler fella...
- That's right.

177
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:04,958
Come up with the ways
Satan's gonna make them sinners pay

178
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:07,291
- come the Judgment Day!
- Yeah!

179
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:09,666
Yeah! Yes, that's right, my friends!

180
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,916
Yes, sir! Praise the Lord!

181
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:13,541
Amen.

182
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,291
Let me tell you something, friends.

183
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:22,583
Before I found the Holy Ghost...

184
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:28,125
I was scared plumb to death of spiders.

185
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:32,500
- Ain't that right, Theodore?
- Mm-hmm.

186
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:34,291
- Mm?
- Hmm.

187
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:38,875
I was a runt,

188
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:41,708
hiding under my mother's long skirts,

189
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:44,458
spiders crawling through my dreams...

190
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:45,458
Hm.

191
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:47,208
Laying eggs in my nightmares.

192
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:49,916
They was...

193
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:52,708
hang in their webs everywhere...

194
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,000
waitin'.

195
00:13:56,291 --> 00:14:00,416
I had fear in me all the time,
awake or asleep, didn't matter.

196
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,083
Now, that's what hell is like,
brothers and sisters!

197
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:04,625
Praise the Lord.

198
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:07,291
I got no rest from them devils!

199
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:08,958
Amen!

200
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:12,708
Not until the Lord gave me strength!

201
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:14,291
Amen!

202
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:16,000
Brothers and sisters...

203
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:17,041
Whoo!

204
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:22,083
Behold!

205
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:25,958
The Lord looks out for me now!

206
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:27,250
Amen!

207
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:35,541
Mark my word, people!

208
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:40,250
The Spirit will take away your fears
if you're willing!

209
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:43,625
Them spiders,
sure was a nice touch.

210
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:45,708
I ain't gonna sleep tonight as it is.

211
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:49,541
I wish Helen left with us.

212
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:53,333
Well, she might have come with us,

213
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:55,958
if you'd paid her a little more attention.

214
00:14:58,166 --> 00:15:00,750
The right man
would make a good life for Helen.

215
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:04,708
<i>Emma was concerned</i>
<i>something bad might happen</i>

216
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:07,083
<i>if she couldn't keep her promise to God.</i>

217
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:13,000
<i>Helen did, in fact, meet the man
she would marry that afternoon.</i>

218
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:14,708
Bless me, Reverend.

219
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:15,958
Bless me.

220
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,250
<i>And Willard's mind was already
hundreds of miles away.</i>

221
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:28,916
Be right there.

222
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,666
I ain't no rush.

223
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:36,375
- Why, if it isn't...
- I never got your name.

224
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:39,416
Charlotte,
second call on chicken over peas.

225
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,916
Be right back with you, hon.

226
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:52,916
<i>See, full-time, I'm a lawyer.</i>

227
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,791
Real estate isn't my business, but...

228
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:59,208
I own a few of these properties
around Meade, Knockemstiff.

229
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:02,500
Real long-term investments.

230
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:05,291
There aren't any sinks in here,
Mr. Dunlap.

231
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:08,583
Ain't no running water, missy.
There's a well out back.

232
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:17,916
What do you think, Arvin?

233
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:57,083
<i>Though he hadn't talked to God in years,</i>

234
00:16:57,166 --> 00:16:59,500
<i>not a single petition or word of praise</i>

235
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:02,416
<i>since he'd come across
the crucified Marine.</i>

236
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:05,833
<i>Willard could feel it
welling up inside him now,</i>

237
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:08,625
<i>the urge to get right with his maker</i>

238
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:11,166
<i>before something bad
happened to his family.</i>

239
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:29,583
Where'd you go?

240
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:31,375
I was just looking the land over.

241
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:33,458
What you think?

242
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:35,416
It's nice.

243
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:41,291
Rent seems fair for what we get.

244
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:43,875
We keep saving,

245
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:45,625
we could probably buy it.

246
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:48,416
Wouldn't that be something?

247
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,333
Arvin have a home of his own.

248
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:53,625
I never did have that.

249
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:56,125
<i>Things are good, Mama.</i>

250
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:59,333
<i>We found a place
in a holler called Knockemstiff.</i>

251
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:00,916
Let's move!

252
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,708
<i>Arvin just turned one,</i>
<i>and he has lots of grass to play on now.</i>

253
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:07,291
<i>We're saving money
to buy the house one day.</i>

254
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:09,958
<i>So things are gonna be tight for a while.</i>

255
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:12,916
<i>We'll get to you as soon as possible.</i>

256
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:16,458
<i>Your son, Willard.</i>

257
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:19,875
<i>P.S...</i>

258
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:23,291
<i>I got the urge to pray again.</i>

259
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:31,125
"We'll get to you as soon as possible.
Your son Willard.

260
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:35,166
P.S. I got the urge to pray again."

261
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:42,166
- Sure you don't mind watching Lenora?
- Sure.

262
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:45,250
Don't mind. Hand her over here.
Where y'all going?

263
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,750
We just thought we'd take a ride.

264
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:50,666
Get out of that little house for a bit.

265
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:56,875
<i>Though she didn't know it,</i>
<i>she'd never see Lenora again.</i>

266
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:03,916
<i>Seven years later, they found
Helen's body buried in the woods.</i>

267
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:06,375
I'm thinking we take a walk.

268
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,791
Be fine to pray outside
and adore them trees.

269
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:13,750
Whatever you want, Roy,
but what about Theodore?

270
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:16,791
Theodore will be all right
sitting in the car.

271
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:19,500
That's right.
Don't y'all worry about me.

272
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:22,625
Maybe I oughta take me a nap.

273
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:26,666
Just be you and me, sweetheart.

274
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:45,333
<i> In 1957,</i>

275
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:48,208
<i>Arvin Eugene Russell was nine years old.</i>

276
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:53,000
<i>He was the only kid on the school bus
who wasn't somebody's relation.</i>

277
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:57,958
<i>Three days before,
he'd come home with another black eye.</i>

278
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:01,250
You're coming out back with me today, boy.

279
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,500
You got a deposit to make, sir?

280
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:13,625
- C'mere, Jack.
- Second time.

281
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:16,666
Those little shits keep picking on him.
It ain't right.

282
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:21,125
Them boys might be bigger than you.

283
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:23,458
But the next time
one of them starts his shit,

284
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:25,083
I want you to finish it.

285
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:26,375
You understand?

286
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:27,541
Yes, sir.

287
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:37,541
Now, you pray on what happened today.

288
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:40,708
And remember,

289
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:42,958
be honest, no bullshittin'.

290
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:44,750
He'll know.

291
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:11,416
Hell, they having
a little revival meetin'.

292
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:15,750
Shit, I'm thinking now'd be a good time
to pay his old lady a visit.

293
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:16,833
Dad?

294
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:20,541
This here's the Lord's time,
not nobody else's.

295
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:22,875
Probably in bed
keeping it warm for me.

296
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:24,708
Shut the fuck up, Lucas.

297
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:26,916
Wouldn't you take a piece of that?

298
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:30,583
Come on, you dumb son of a bitch.
This thing's getting heavy.

299
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:39,916
<i>Despite Arvin's fears,</i>

300
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,666
<i>the two poachers
didn't head to his home that day.</i>

301
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:21,833
Arvin, gonna go gas up.

302
00:22:21,916 --> 00:22:24,500
No sense in you
napping in here like a house cat all day.

303
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:27,208
- Get off the couch, Jack.
- Can Jack come?

304
00:22:28,416 --> 00:22:29,458
Mm-hmm.

305
00:22:29,541 --> 00:22:31,500
- Come on, Jack.
- Hey.

306
00:22:33,625 --> 00:22:35,000
Will you get me some sugar?

307
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:36,875
Hmm.

308
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,083
Roll up your window.

309
00:23:09,708 --> 00:23:10,833
Motherfucker!

310
00:23:22,125 --> 00:23:25,458
- -Oh, shit! Hey, take it easy!
- He's gonna fuckin' kill him!

311
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:28,291
Come on! Get off him!

312
00:23:28,375 --> 00:23:30,125
That's enough!
You're gonna kill him!

313
00:23:35,291 --> 00:23:36,250
Oh, shit!

314
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:40,333
God!

315
00:23:40,416 --> 00:23:43,166
- Stubbs!
- Stubbs, get out here, man!

316
00:23:43,916 --> 00:23:45,875
- Get out of here!
- Come on, give me a hand.

317
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:47,375
Get the fuck out of here!

318
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,208
Now you remember what I told you?

319
00:24:02,375 --> 00:24:04,500
About them boys on the bus
that gave you the black eye?

320
00:24:05,791 --> 00:24:07,041
That's what I meant.

321
00:24:08,083 --> 00:24:10,333
Just gotta pick the right time.

322
00:24:11,208 --> 00:24:12,166
Yes, sir.

323
00:24:12,833 --> 00:24:14,958
There's a lot of no good
sons of bitches out there.

324
00:24:16,333 --> 00:24:18,666
More than a hundred?

325
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,333
Yeah, at least that many.

326
00:24:27,375 --> 00:24:29,333
How about I buy you a candy bar, huh?

327
00:24:31,125 --> 00:24:33,666
We gotta get some sugar for Mama too.

328
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:34,791
Mm-hmm.

329
00:24:34,875 --> 00:24:37,500
<i>Arvin would often think back on this day</i>

330
00:24:37,583 --> 00:24:40,125
<i>as the best one
he ever spent with his father.</i>

331
00:24:40,708 --> 00:24:43,291
So what kind of candy bar
you gonna get, huh?

332
00:24:43,375 --> 00:24:45,958
Um... a Charleston Chew, yeah.

333
00:24:46,916 --> 00:24:47,833
Mama?

334
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:49,916
Mama?

335
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:51,958
Mama?

336
00:24:53,875 --> 00:24:57,000
Mama?

337
00:24:57,083 --> 00:24:58,083
Dad!

338
00:24:58,666 --> 00:24:59,625
Mama!

339
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:03,041
No! Charlotte!

340
00:25:03,541 --> 00:25:06,291
Listen to me. Charlotte!

341
00:25:14,291 --> 00:25:17,666
- What are you saying?
- The test results aren't good.

342
00:25:18,416 --> 00:25:21,000
The morphine will continue
to dampen the pain but...

343
00:25:21,541 --> 00:25:23,666
there's no way we can destroy that cancer.

344
00:25:29,458 --> 00:25:31,083
Let's talk downstairs.

345
00:25:44,375 --> 00:25:47,875
Now... them doctors
can't do your mom any good.

346
00:25:51,458 --> 00:25:52,291
But He can save her.

347
00:25:53,791 --> 00:25:56,166
Yeah, if we just pray hard enough.

348
00:25:58,625 --> 00:25:59,958
The Lord can do anything

349
00:26:00,625 --> 00:26:02,916
if you just ask him right.

350
00:26:03,416 --> 00:26:04,458
Okay?

351
00:26:05,333 --> 00:26:06,500
Now hold them tight.

352
00:26:07,208 --> 00:26:08,625
And pray like you mean it.

353
00:26:16,291 --> 00:26:17,125
Lord,

354
00:26:17,958 --> 00:26:19,625
please save my wife.

355
00:26:21,916 --> 00:26:24,666
Destroy this cancer inside her, Lord.

356
00:26:26,458 --> 00:26:28,458
We need your help, Lord.

357
00:26:29,541 --> 00:26:33,041
We need your help,
and I know you can do it.

358
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,458
I know you can do it.

359
00:26:35,541 --> 00:26:37,583
Please Lord, please.

360
00:26:41,083 --> 00:26:42,375
Pray, God dammit.

361
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:45,708
- You want your mama to die?
- No, sir.

362
00:26:45,791 --> 00:26:46,750
Then pray!

363
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:52,416
Lord, please save my mama!

364
00:26:52,916 --> 00:26:56,750
- Clean the cancer inside of her!
- We need your help!

365
00:26:59,166 --> 00:27:01,833
Now you pray, now! You hear me?

366
00:27:01,916 --> 00:27:02,958
Yes, Lord!

367
00:27:03,041 --> 00:27:04,541
Save my mama, Lord!

368
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:07,250
Please clean the cancer inside of her!

369
00:27:08,458 --> 00:27:11,250
And don't be crying, you hear?
Don't be crying!

370
00:27:11,333 --> 00:27:14,791
Pray like you mean it! Lord!

371
00:27:14,875 --> 00:27:15,875
Spare my wife!

372
00:27:17,791 --> 00:27:19,458
Don't take her from me.

373
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:26,666
Don't take her from me.

374
00:27:31,125 --> 00:27:32,750
Don't take her from me.

375
00:27:57,916 --> 00:28:00,041
Everything's gonna be okay.

376
00:28:00,125 --> 00:28:01,458
God'll hear us.

377
00:28:02,541 --> 00:28:04,041
And he'll take care of Mama.

378
00:28:05,916 --> 00:28:07,083
You good, honey.

379
00:28:10,041 --> 00:28:13,166
We got cozy rooms in the back
if you need some company.

380
00:28:14,291 --> 00:28:15,541
I'm fine.

381
00:28:31,541 --> 00:28:35,041
<i>It occurred to him</i>
<i>that maybe something more was expected</i>

382
00:28:35,125 --> 00:28:37,625
<i>than just his prayers and sincerity.</i>

383
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,750
<i>God had a tendency
of asking men to make sacrifices</i>

384
00:28:43,833 --> 00:28:45,750
<i>in order to prove their faith.</i>

385
00:29:08,375 --> 00:29:10,000
Dad, no!

386
00:29:10,875 --> 00:29:15,083
Dad, no!

387
00:29:15,166 --> 00:29:16,125
Dad!

388
00:29:16,208 --> 00:29:19,791
Lord, this here is my boy's dog.

389
00:29:20,291 --> 00:29:21,375
We loved him.

390
00:29:22,208 --> 00:29:23,625
He loved him.

391
00:29:29,583 --> 00:29:31,000
Now you take him!

392
00:29:31,083 --> 00:29:32,541
Bring him back!

393
00:29:32,625 --> 00:29:34,041
You save Charlotte!

394
00:29:35,875 --> 00:29:37,458
It's gonna be all right, Arvin.

395
00:29:38,291 --> 00:29:39,666
It's gonna be all right.

396
00:30:02,666 --> 00:30:04,625
I'm thinking
we might take us a trip.

397
00:30:07,041 --> 00:30:09,333
Go down and visit your grandma
in Coal Creek.

398
00:30:11,916 --> 00:30:13,916
You can meet Uncle Earskell.

399
00:30:15,041 --> 00:30:17,041
And that girl that's living with them...

400
00:30:17,875 --> 00:30:19,750
She's just a little younger than you.

401
00:30:19,833 --> 00:30:22,083
Maybe we'll stay for a while.

402
00:30:30,125 --> 00:30:31,208
Arvin.

403
00:30:48,541 --> 00:30:50,291
<i>I wish you were here, Jack.</i>

404
00:30:52,875 --> 00:30:54,250
When Dad goes to sleep...

405
00:30:55,458 --> 00:30:58,333
I'm going to bring you down
and give you a proper burial.

406
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:01,083
Just like they gave to Mama.

407
00:31:23,416 --> 00:31:26,166
I'm not doing that no more, you hear me?

408
00:31:26,833 --> 00:31:28,125
I ain't prayin'!

409
00:31:29,416 --> 00:31:30,333
You hear me?

410
00:31:31,583 --> 00:31:33,375
I said I'm not doing that no more.

411
00:31:35,083 --> 00:31:36,583
You hear me?

412
00:31:47,791 --> 00:31:50,666
There's money to be made
if a man of the law is careful and...

413
00:31:51,333 --> 00:31:52,750
doesn't get a big head.

414
00:31:54,083 --> 00:31:56,416
I wanna get out of my house, Lee.

415
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:58,541
I told you, sweetie,

416
00:31:59,333 --> 00:32:00,833
it's only matter of time.

417
00:32:01,708 --> 00:32:03,458
And no more parking lots.

418
00:32:04,125 --> 00:32:07,125
No more Pepsi cups. Just a big ole bed.

419
00:32:08,208 --> 00:32:09,041
Yeah.

420
00:32:09,125 --> 00:32:11,125
People like me in this town.

421
00:32:11,916 --> 00:32:13,791
- You know that, honey.
- Mm-hmm.

422
00:32:13,875 --> 00:32:14,791
Yeah.

423
00:32:15,625 --> 00:32:17,416
I'll get myself elected.

424
00:32:20,208 --> 00:32:21,125
Get a...

425
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:24,208
- cushy place up in Brewer Heights.
- Mm-hmm.

426
00:32:25,041 --> 00:32:26,208
You see them...

427
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,583
That was good.

428
00:32:39,333 --> 00:32:41,125
- You get it all in the cup?
- Yeah.

429
00:32:41,208 --> 00:32:43,833
<i>Any cars out</i>
<i>around Knockemstiff? Over.</i>

430
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:51,125
<i>Deputy Bodecker around those parts?</i>

431
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:53,125
<i>We got a call from Hank over at...</i>

432
00:32:53,208 --> 00:32:54,958
- Fuck.
<i>- Can you get over and check that out?</i>

433
00:32:55,041 --> 00:32:57,250
- Can I come with you?
- Are you crazy?

434
00:32:57,333 --> 00:32:59,666
- Come on.
- Didn't you hear anything I said?

435
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:01,333
I've got an election to think about.

436
00:33:13,125 --> 00:33:14,125
Well?

437
00:33:14,916 --> 00:33:18,666
Better not be one of them goddamn
window peepers you keep calling about.

438
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:21,750
I wish it was.
It's about this boy's Daddy.

439
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:23,583
Well, what is it, son?

440
00:33:25,333 --> 00:33:26,208
He's dead.

441
00:33:26,708 --> 00:33:28,875
And they buried his poor mama today.

442
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:30,958
It's a damn shame, it is.

443
00:33:31,583 --> 00:33:33,000
Is that blood on your face?

444
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,375
No.

445
00:33:35,416 --> 00:33:37,125
Somebody left us a pie.

446
00:33:43,625 --> 00:33:45,833
- He's right there.
- Jesus.

447
00:33:45,916 --> 00:33:47,166
What's that smell?

448
00:33:50,291 --> 00:33:51,458
God dammit, boy.

449
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:54,875
What the hell is this?

450
00:33:55,125 --> 00:33:56,416
It's a prayer log.

451
00:33:57,291 --> 00:33:58,125
Prayer log?

452
00:33:58,625 --> 00:33:59,500
Yeah.

453
00:34:00,833 --> 00:34:02,416
But it don't work too good.

454
00:34:06,666 --> 00:34:07,916
Lenora?

455
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,458
{\an8}Mama's coming, Lenora.

456
00:34:10,333 --> 00:34:12,958
{\an8}It's all right.

457
00:34:15,083 --> 00:34:17,166
Hey, it's all right.

458
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:19,958
It's all right.

459
00:34:20,041 --> 00:34:21,541
Roy!

460
00:34:21,625 --> 00:34:22,625
Your dinner's ready.

461
00:34:22,708 --> 00:34:25,791
I've got the Holy Ghost in me!
I'm ready to use it!

462
00:34:29,666 --> 00:34:30,708
Lord!

463
00:34:31,375 --> 00:34:32,958
- Speak!
- Roy?

464
00:34:35,666 --> 00:34:36,958
I've been thinking...

465
00:34:39,333 --> 00:34:42,125
Maybe the Lord wants you
to come out into the light.

466
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:49,291
I mean, how can you be close to God
stuck in there?

467
00:34:51,458 --> 00:34:53,166
The Lord don't like dark places.

468
00:34:59,125 --> 00:34:59,958
Roy?

469
00:35:00,041 --> 00:35:04,041
<i>Roy'd been bitten on the cheek</i>
<i>by a spider while preaching a sermon,</i>

470
00:35:04,125 --> 00:35:06,625
<i>and his head had puffed up
as big as a pumpkin.</i>

471
00:35:06,708 --> 00:35:07,833
All right, then.

472
00:35:10,458 --> 00:35:11,750
Enjoy your dinner.

473
00:35:12,375 --> 00:35:15,083
<i>In the time it took</i>
<i>the swelling to go down,</i>

474
00:35:15,166 --> 00:35:17,666
<i>he'd become convinced
that the Lord was testing him</i>

475
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:20,291
<i>to see if he was ready
to take on something bigger.</i>

476
00:35:21,416 --> 00:35:25,208
<i>He'd stayed in the dark closet
for a fortnight waiting on an answer.</i>

477
00:35:26,125 --> 00:35:28,875
<i>He smelled worse
than a truck-stop shitter.</i>

478
00:35:43,375 --> 00:35:45,625
Lord, is that you?

479
00:35:45,708 --> 00:35:48,125
Oh, no, I'm not scared!

480
00:35:48,208 --> 00:35:50,833
I trust in you!

481
00:35:50,916 --> 00:35:52,250
Glory to God!

482
00:35:52,916 --> 00:35:56,625
I hear you! Yes, I am here!

483
00:35:57,791 --> 00:36:01,666
Helen. Oh, it's so good to see you, honey.

484
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:04,750
- Been a while, ain't it?
- Is everything all right?

485
00:36:04,833 --> 00:36:06,333
Oh, everything's fine now.

486
00:36:06,875 --> 00:36:09,250
Uh, Roy finally got
himself straightened out.

487
00:36:10,125 --> 00:36:12,750
Well, that's good to hear.

488
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:17,083
"P.S.
I got the urge to pray again."

489
00:36:21,708 --> 00:36:24,250
- Sure you don't mind watching Lenora?
- Sure.

490
00:36:24,333 --> 00:36:27,333
Don't mind. Hand her over here.
Where y'all going?

491
00:36:27,416 --> 00:36:29,833
We just thought we'd take a ride.

492
00:36:29,916 --> 00:36:32,583
Get out of that little house for a bit.

493
00:36:34,291 --> 00:36:35,625
There you go.

494
00:36:36,833 --> 00:36:37,791
Yes.

495
00:36:56,958 --> 00:36:59,666
This spot looks about
as good a place as any, don't it?

496
00:37:00,916 --> 00:37:01,833
Yes.

497
00:37:06,875 --> 00:37:08,416
The Lord is here, sweetheart.

498
00:37:08,958 --> 00:37:10,000
I can feel him.

499
00:37:18,583 --> 00:37:19,958
God loves you, Helen.

500
00:37:46,375 --> 00:37:47,291
Lenora...

501
00:38:33,833 --> 00:38:34,750
God...

502
00:38:37,666 --> 00:38:39,083
I've heard your word.

503
00:38:44,583 --> 00:38:45,583
Helen...

504
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,333
I resurrect you...

505
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:58,583
with the grace of God in me...

506
00:39:00,875 --> 00:39:02,375
I resurrect you!

507
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:06,375
Return!

508
00:39:16,166 --> 00:39:17,250
God!

509
00:39:19,041 --> 00:39:20,333
It is time!

510
00:39:24,333 --> 00:39:26,083
Resurrect! Return!

511
00:39:31,208 --> 00:39:34,125
Return, Spirit! Resurrect!

512
00:39:38,375 --> 00:39:39,375
God!

513
00:39:43,333 --> 00:39:44,625
Resur...

514
00:39:44,708 --> 00:39:45,958
God!

515
00:39:47,375 --> 00:39:48,625
Resurrect!

516
00:39:51,875 --> 00:39:53,125
Come on, now!

517
00:39:54,916 --> 00:39:56,458
Come on, now, res...

518
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,916
I could tell the police what happened.

519
00:40:05,458 --> 00:40:06,750
That it was an accident.

520
00:40:09,666 --> 00:40:12,333
You stabbed your wife
in the neck with a screwdriver.

521
00:40:12,416 --> 00:40:15,416
Tried to bring her back from the dead
and then buried her body.

522
00:40:17,208 --> 00:40:19,166
That ain't an accident, Roy.

523
00:40:20,125 --> 00:40:22,708
That sounds like a crazy person
who killed his wife.

524
00:40:28,083 --> 00:40:29,333
Keep driving south.

525
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:32,541
If we stay off highways,

526
00:40:32,625 --> 00:40:33,750
we should be fine.

527
00:40:48,208 --> 00:40:50,500
Where are we, Roy?

528
00:40:58,625 --> 00:40:59,500
Roy?

529
00:41:07,708 --> 00:41:08,583
Roy?

530
00:41:12,083 --> 00:41:12,916
Roy?

531
00:41:17,375 --> 00:41:18,375
Where about?

532
00:41:19,458 --> 00:41:20,958
C-Coal Creek, West Virginia.

533
00:41:21,041 --> 00:41:22,791
We'll get you close enough, son.

534
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:25,375
I'm Carl, by the way, this here's Sandy.

535
00:41:26,166 --> 00:41:27,791
Huh? Ain't she somethin'?

536
00:41:29,583 --> 00:41:31,541
Mister, I do appreciate this.

537
00:41:31,625 --> 00:41:34,708
I don't understand
people that won't pick up strangers.

538
00:41:34,791 --> 00:41:37,125
It should be a good thing,
helping someone out.

539
00:41:37,208 --> 00:41:38,458
You sound like a Christian.

540
00:41:38,541 --> 00:41:40,500
Carl used to teach at Sunday school.

541
00:41:40,583 --> 00:41:41,750
Didn't you, babe?

542
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:42,750
That's right.

543
00:41:43,583 --> 00:41:44,666
That's right.

544
00:41:47,458 --> 00:41:48,625
What's your name, sweetie?

545
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:50,333
It's Roy.

546
00:41:51,333 --> 00:41:52,708
Roy Laferty.

547
00:41:52,791 --> 00:41:54,708
So what's in West Virginia, Roy?

548
00:41:55,416 --> 00:41:57,166
Going back home to see my daughter.

549
00:41:58,583 --> 00:42:00,833
Buddy, come on.

550
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:03,291
Hey, come on.

551
00:42:04,666 --> 00:42:06,041
I wanna show you something.

552
00:42:06,541 --> 00:42:07,541
Huh?

553
00:42:21,541 --> 00:42:22,625
What?

554
00:42:22,708 --> 00:42:25,041
I'm giving you a good thing here, buddy.

555
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:26,000
Come on.

556
00:42:35,666 --> 00:42:37,875
Said I'm giving you
a good thing here, buddy.

557
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:43,458
I wanna get some shots of your ugly
old mug sitting next to a pretty lady.

558
00:42:44,625 --> 00:42:48,250
Come on, she likes lanky old studs
like yourself. Come on.

559
00:42:52,083 --> 00:42:53,958
What's going on here, mister?

560
00:42:54,041 --> 00:42:56,500
Oh, come on, Jesus Christ, huh?

561
00:42:57,833 --> 00:43:00,750
Pay attention. It's like I said,
you're gonna fuck my wife

562
00:43:00,833 --> 00:43:03,125
and I'm gonna take some pictures,
that's all.

563
00:43:04,791 --> 00:43:05,708
Your wife?

564
00:43:06,916 --> 00:43:07,791
Come on.

565
00:43:09,208 --> 00:43:11,125
I've never heard of such a thing.

566
00:43:12,041 --> 00:43:13,875
I thought you was a good Christian...

567
00:43:13,958 --> 00:43:16,666
Shut the fuck up
and get that welfare suit off, son.

568
00:43:18,083 --> 00:43:20,625
- Jesus.
- Well, I've been run through the wringer!

569
00:43:22,458 --> 00:43:24,625
Do you really want these hands
touching you?

570
00:43:24,708 --> 00:43:25,791
Oh, come on, sweetie.

571
00:43:25,875 --> 00:43:29,625
We'll just take a few pictures and then
the big dumb bastard will leave us alone.

572
00:43:29,708 --> 00:43:32,458
Woman... look at me.

573
00:43:33,875 --> 00:43:36,583
Do what I say, you son of a bitch.

574
00:43:44,625 --> 00:43:45,583
No, I ain't.

575
00:43:49,791 --> 00:43:51,166
Oh, Jesus.

576
00:43:57,541 --> 00:43:59,916
Carl, maybe we should just
get out of here.

577
00:44:01,375 --> 00:44:02,416
Oh, forget it. Jesus.

578
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:04,208
- I'm cold, Carl.
- I know it's cold

579
00:44:04,291 --> 00:44:06,833
<i>Roy looked up</i>
<i>at the clouds drifting by and wondered</i>

580
00:44:06,916 --> 00:44:10,583
<i>if that's what death would be like,
just floating away in the air.</i>

581
00:44:13,083 --> 00:44:16,541
<i>He preached on it for years,
but still didn't know what to expect.</i>

582
00:44:18,125 --> 00:44:19,541
Just one thing.

583
00:44:20,041 --> 00:44:21,125
Yeah, what's that?

584
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:23,833
Her name is Lenora.

585
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:27,125
What the fuck you talking about?

586
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:30,958
My little girl.

587
00:44:32,291 --> 00:44:33,708
Lenor...

588
00:44:40,583 --> 00:44:41,416
Come on.

589
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:44,041
<i>This was still early days for the pair,</i>

590
00:44:44,125 --> 00:44:46,541
<i>and Carl was still working out
the particulars.</i>

591
00:44:46,625 --> 00:44:47,583
God damn...

592
00:44:47,666 --> 00:44:51,375
<i>He realized that he would have
to get more selective with his models</i>

593
00:44:51,458 --> 00:44:53,208
<i>if he wanted to keep Sandy on board.</i>

594
00:44:53,291 --> 00:44:56,208
Get some shots off down there
while the light's still good.

595
00:45:08,916 --> 00:45:10,375
Good day, ma'am.

596
00:45:10,458 --> 00:45:12,000
- You Emma Russell?
- Yes.

597
00:45:14,375 --> 00:45:17,583
I have some papers for you to sign
and the boy here's all yours.

598
00:45:17,666 --> 00:45:18,833
Here, let me have that.

599
00:45:25,833 --> 00:45:26,875
Arvin?

600
00:45:31,250 --> 00:45:33,291
Here, you give me that heavy old bag.

601
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:37,875
Oh...

602
00:45:43,833 --> 00:45:45,166
Oh...

603
00:45:47,416 --> 00:45:48,791
Oh, sweetie,

604
00:45:48,875 --> 00:45:51,208
we are so happy you're here.

605
00:45:54,041 --> 00:45:55,291
This here is your...

606
00:45:55,958 --> 00:45:57,416
your Uncle Earskell.

607
00:45:57,916 --> 00:45:58,791
Hey, there.

608
00:45:59,958 --> 00:46:02,083
This is Lenora.

609
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:05,875
Lenora is your stepsister.

610
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:07,541
Hi, Arvin.

611
00:46:10,291 --> 00:46:11,125
Hi.

612
00:46:23,083 --> 00:46:24,250
Here we go.

613
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:40,416
Oh, here we go.

614
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:44,458
- Happy birthday, Arvin.
- Happy birthday, honey.

615
00:46:44,541 --> 00:46:46,833
- Happy birthday!
- Oh, no.

616
00:46:53,333 --> 00:46:55,291
Happy birthday.

617
00:46:59,416 --> 00:47:00,333
All right.

618
00:47:02,375 --> 00:47:04,958
Make a wish
before that candle burns out.

619
00:47:05,041 --> 00:47:07,000
It looks like a dandy cake.

620
00:47:10,791 --> 00:47:13,041
- Arvin!
- All right, hang on.

621
00:47:20,625 --> 00:47:21,541
Thank you.

622
00:47:26,916 --> 00:47:27,750
Well...

623
00:47:28,708 --> 00:47:30,250
This was your daddy's.

624
00:47:48,125 --> 00:47:49,125
What's that?

625
00:47:50,833 --> 00:47:52,958
That's Willard's gun he gave me.

626
00:47:53,666 --> 00:47:55,416
I figure it's time to pass it on.

627
00:47:56,875 --> 00:47:58,250
That's a German Luger.

628
00:47:59,416 --> 00:48:01,083
Brought back from the war.

629
00:48:02,916 --> 00:48:06,083
I... got no use for handguns myself.

630
00:48:06,166 --> 00:48:08,166
But I figure he'd want you to have it.

631
00:48:15,750 --> 00:48:19,291
It's the best present
I ever got. Thank you, Uncle Earskell.

632
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:22,375
Shotgun's what'll do you good.

633
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,500
Maybe, but I don't have
anything else of his, so...

634
00:48:27,083 --> 00:48:28,375
thank you.

635
00:48:31,125 --> 00:48:32,666
Time does pass.

636
00:48:35,416 --> 00:48:36,666
Get down there.

637
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:40,250
<i> Boys in school liked</i>
<i>to pick on Lenora for her pious manner</i>

638
00:48:40,333 --> 00:48:41,625
<i>and pinched face.</i>

639
00:48:42,125 --> 00:48:46,083
You're so damn ugly, I'd need a sack
over your head just to get a hard-on.

<i>Tommy Matson, and Orville Buckman</i>

642
00:48:53,625 --> 00:48:56,083
Probably fucked your brother,
you brother fucker.

643
00:48:57,583 --> 00:48:58,708
Hey!

644
00:49:00,708 --> 00:49:03,916
- Come on, get him!
- Please stop! Stop!

645
00:49:05,333 --> 00:49:06,458
God dammit!

646
00:49:07,958 --> 00:49:10,250
- Get the fuck off me!
- Stop it!

647
00:49:10,333 --> 00:49:11,916
Get off of me! Fuck!

648
00:49:12,416 --> 00:49:14,791
<i>Arvin loved her like his own sister.</i>

649
00:49:14,875 --> 00:49:17,708
- Sister fucker.
<i>- He would do anything to protect her.</i>

650
00:49:18,833 --> 00:49:20,958
<i>No matter what the weather was,</i>

651
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:23,750
<i>Lenora would visit her mother's grave
after school.</i>

652
00:49:24,708 --> 00:49:27,208
<i>Some days
she'd even read the Bible out loud,</i>

653
00:49:27,291 --> 00:49:29,166
<i>and imagine her mother was listening.</i>

654
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:32,083
<i>Though he wasn't one for praying</i>

655
00:49:32,666 --> 00:49:35,166
<i>Arvin would often drive her
and keep her company.</i>

656
00:49:36,333 --> 00:49:37,500
Arvin?

657
00:49:44,875 --> 00:49:47,500
It was a sight
you didn't end up in the hospital.

658
00:49:48,291 --> 00:49:52,000
Yeah, well, there's a lot of no good
sons of bitches out there.

659
00:49:52,583 --> 00:49:56,250
Well, Lord, Arvin, you've been saying that
almost since the day I met you.

660
00:49:56,875 --> 00:49:58,625
You know, that's because it's true.

661
00:50:00,708 --> 00:50:03,875
Maybe you should try praying for 'em then.
Would that hurt none?

662
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:09,333
You already do enough for all of us,
and where's it doing you much good, huh?

663
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:12,125
You know what would do you good?

664
00:50:12,791 --> 00:50:16,416
To not be wandering behind school
by your own self, like I told you.

665
00:50:18,083 --> 00:50:19,625
Fuckin' Gene Dinwoodie.

666
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:25,208
Do you ever think about...

667
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,458
how we ended up orphans
living in the same house?

668
00:50:30,625 --> 00:50:31,583
No.

669
00:50:32,583 --> 00:50:34,666
Besides, you might not even be an orphan.

670
00:50:35,625 --> 00:50:37,458
As far as everybody
around here is concerned

671
00:50:37,541 --> 00:50:40,333
your daddy's probably still out there
somewhere alive and kicking.

672
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:46,000
Fuck, he might even come over that hill
any day now, dancing a jig.

673
00:50:47,916 --> 00:50:49,083
I hope so.

674
00:50:50,666 --> 00:50:52,583
I pray every day he will.

675
00:50:53,916 --> 00:50:55,625
Even if it means he did something?

676
00:50:56,250 --> 00:50:58,083
I've already forgiven him.

677
00:50:58,583 --> 00:50:59,500
Hm.

678
00:51:00,833 --> 00:51:02,041
We could start over.

679
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:05,250
That's crazy.

680
00:51:05,333 --> 00:51:06,458
No, it's not.

681
00:51:11,125 --> 00:51:12,291
What about your father?

682
00:51:16,083 --> 00:51:17,208
What about him?

683
00:51:18,583 --> 00:51:20,041
I know what my daddy did.

684
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:25,666
Well...

685
00:51:26,916 --> 00:51:28,458
forgivin' him...

686
00:51:29,708 --> 00:51:30,875
if he could come back.

687
00:51:30,958 --> 00:51:33,791
Well, shut your mouth. We both know
that ain't never gonna happen.

688
00:51:35,250 --> 00:51:36,875
I'm sorry for bringing it up.

689
00:51:36,958 --> 00:51:38,333
It's all right.

690
00:51:40,208 --> 00:51:43,875
You know,
I appreciate you always coming with me.

691
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,625
I know you'd probably rather
be doing something else.

692
00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:54,416
We're kin.
We gotta look out for each other.

693
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:56,083
Lenora! Arvin!

694
00:51:56,708 --> 00:51:57,541
C'mere!

695
00:51:58,708 --> 00:52:00,041
I might be gone a while.

696
00:52:02,125 --> 00:52:03,416
I'll be praying for you.

697
00:52:05,291 --> 00:52:06,583
In the meantime...

698
00:52:09,666 --> 00:52:11,916
My sister's boy from down in Tennessee

699
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,875
is gonna come up and take my place.

700
00:52:15,250 --> 00:52:17,333
He just graduated from one of them...

701
00:52:17,875 --> 00:52:19,166
Bible colleges.

702
00:52:20,041 --> 00:52:24,250
Well, I would appreciate it if you all
would try and make him feel welcome.

703
00:52:26,208 --> 00:52:29,625
Tell your grandmama I'm asking folks
to bring a dish next sermon.

704
00:52:29,708 --> 00:52:30,666
Of course.

705
00:52:31,666 --> 00:52:33,916
What you got planned
after school, Arvin?

706
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,916
Cliff Baker says he can get me
on the crew laying blacktop

707
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,583
on the Greenbrier stretch off Route 60.

708
00:52:39,666 --> 00:52:40,583
Yeah.

709
00:52:40,666 --> 00:52:42,541
I'm probably just gonna do that. You?

710
00:52:42,625 --> 00:52:44,916
Oh, my old man's holding me here.

711
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Better than getting shipped off
to Vietnam I expect.

712
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:49,708
Yeah, I suppose so.

713
00:52:50,583 --> 00:52:52,041
Everyone says

714
00:52:52,541 --> 00:52:55,250
they like the way I do them, but I...

715
00:52:55,333 --> 00:52:57,708
Well, just get him a big steak then.

716
00:52:58,708 --> 00:53:01,083
You know
I can't afford anything like that.

717
00:53:02,083 --> 00:53:05,166
Grandma, quit worrying about it.
He's just a preacher.

718
00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:08,750
Anyway, everyone says ain't no one
doesn't like you, you know that.

719
00:53:09,208 --> 00:53:10,625
So chicken livers it is.

720
00:53:26,625 --> 00:53:28,500
It's nice to meet you, Reverend.

721
00:53:28,583 --> 00:53:33,000
It's nice to meet you.

722
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:36,166
- Nice to meet you, Reverend.
- Nice to meet you.

723
00:53:39,916 --> 00:53:43,166
<i> Emma was known</i>
<i>as one of the best cooks in the county.</i>

724
00:53:43,750 --> 00:53:45,875
<i>When people praised her food,</i>

725
00:53:45,958 --> 00:53:48,375
<i>she always told them
that she couldn't fry an egg</i>

726
00:53:48,458 --> 00:53:49,958
<i>until she found the Lord.</i>

727
00:53:50,791 --> 00:53:53,416
<i>And that he was the one
that guided her hand</i>

728
00:53:53,541 --> 00:53:55,333
<i>and made everything turn out good.</i>

729
00:54:08,416 --> 00:54:09,708
All right.

730
00:54:09,791 --> 00:54:11,375
My heart's in my stomach.

731
00:54:12,166 --> 00:54:13,708
That hat. You know better.

732
00:54:24,875 --> 00:54:25,750
Hello there.

733
00:54:25,833 --> 00:54:27,708
Pleased to meet you, Reverend.

734
00:54:27,791 --> 00:54:28,833
Emma Russell.

735
00:54:28,916 --> 00:54:31,458
Nice to meet you too. What you got there?

736
00:54:39,166 --> 00:54:41,583
<i>As Preston Teagardin swished the juice</i>

737
00:54:41,666 --> 00:54:43,875
<i>from the chicken livers
around in his mouth,</i>

738
00:54:43,958 --> 00:54:46,791
<i>he felt the stirrings
of a sermon coming on.</i>

739
00:54:47,791 --> 00:54:48,666
Blessed...

740
00:54:49,166 --> 00:54:50,833
are they who hunger...

741
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:52,583
and thirst...

742
00:54:53,583 --> 00:54:54,791
for righteousness.

743
00:55:01,125 --> 00:55:02,583
Hope you like them, Reverend.

744
00:55:04,291 --> 00:55:06,583
<i> Preston loved</i>
<i>the way people listened to him</i>

745
00:55:06,666 --> 00:55:08,041
<i>and held onto every word.</i>

746
00:55:08,125 --> 00:55:09,166
Hmm.

747
00:55:09,250 --> 00:55:12,500
<i>He was grateful</i>
<i>his mother decided all those years ago</i>

748
00:55:12,833 --> 00:55:14,208
<i>that he was going to be a preacher.</i>

749
00:55:15,166 --> 00:55:16,958
<i>He'd never win a fist fight,</i>

750
00:55:17,250 --> 00:55:20,250
<i>but he could recite
the Book of Revelation in his sleep.</i>

751
00:55:34,083 --> 00:55:35,375
Friends...

752
00:55:38,125 --> 00:55:39,375
There's no doubt...

753
00:55:40,958 --> 00:55:44,458
we're all humble people gathered here.

754
00:55:44,541 --> 00:55:45,916
- Amen.
- Amen.

755
00:55:46,416 --> 00:55:48,250
Y'all have been awful nice to me

756
00:55:48,875 --> 00:55:51,541
and I thank you from the bottom
of my heart for the welcome.

757
00:55:51,625 --> 00:55:53,583
Yes.

758
00:55:54,166 --> 00:55:55,166
But friends...

759
00:55:57,666 --> 00:55:58,958
the poor soul...

760
00:55:59,416 --> 00:56:02,291
that brung in them chicken livers
on that beat-up plate...

761
00:56:04,041 --> 00:56:07,291
let's just say I'm inspired to preach
on it for a minute before we eat.

762
00:56:09,666 --> 00:56:10,541
Sure...

763
00:56:11,541 --> 00:56:14,000
some of us are better off than others.

764
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,250
And I see...

765
00:56:17,125 --> 00:56:21,000
plenty of white meat and red meat

766
00:56:21,083 --> 00:56:22,666
laid out on this table.

767
00:56:23,750 --> 00:56:26,875
And I suspect that the folks
that carried them platters in

768
00:56:26,958 --> 00:56:29,791
- eat mighty good sometimes.
- Yes, sir.

769
00:56:29,875 --> 00:56:31,125
But poor people...

770
00:56:32,291 --> 00:56:35,166
got to bring what they can afford.

771
00:56:36,166 --> 00:56:37,500
So them organs...

772
00:56:41,083 --> 00:56:42,416
is a sign to me...

773
00:56:44,166 --> 00:56:45,958
telling me that I should,

774
00:56:46,041 --> 00:56:48,791
as the new preacher of this church,

775
00:56:48,875 --> 00:56:50,708
sacrifice myself.

776
00:56:50,791 --> 00:56:53,541
So that y'all can have a share
of the good meat tonight.

777
00:56:54,083 --> 00:56:56,291
And that's what I'm going to do, friends.

778
00:56:56,375 --> 00:56:58,916
I'm going to eat these organs.

779
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:02,166
'Cause I model myself
on the good Lord Jesus

780
00:57:02,250 --> 00:57:04,250
whenever he gives me the chance.

781
00:57:04,333 --> 00:57:05,416
And today...

782
00:57:06,125 --> 00:57:08,583
he's blessed me with another opportunity

783
00:57:08,666 --> 00:57:10,708
- to follow in his footsteps.
- Amen.

784
00:57:18,416 --> 00:57:21,291
Now, don't you worry
about that pus-gutted blowhard.

785
00:57:21,375 --> 00:57:23,875
I bet he ain't got two nickels
to rub together.

786
00:57:23,958 --> 00:57:26,708
I never been
so embarrassed in all my life.

787
00:57:26,791 --> 00:57:28,625
I could've crawled right under the table.

788
00:57:28,708 --> 00:57:30,958
- All right, I'm gonna go talk to him.
- No, Arvin.

789
00:57:31,041 --> 00:57:32,458
None of that.

790
00:57:32,541 --> 00:57:34,708
He sure ain't the preacher
I was hoping for.

791
00:57:35,625 --> 00:57:39,250
Grandma, that ain't no preacher.
He's as bad as they got on the damn radio.

792
00:57:40,333 --> 00:57:43,125
Heck, I bet he just wanted
them chicken livers all for his own self.

793
00:57:43,208 --> 00:57:44,416
That's why he did that.

794
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:46,708
You see the way he was gobbling them down.

795
00:57:46,791 --> 00:57:48,625
You shouldn't talk like that, Arvin.

796
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:53,375
Preacher Teagardin wouldn't be here
if the Lord hadn't sent him.

797
00:58:10,916 --> 00:58:13,250
Whoo! Lenora!

798
00:58:15,375 --> 00:58:17,833
Hey, chicken shit!

799
00:58:26,083 --> 00:58:27,916
That preacher's a little flashy.

800
00:58:30,958 --> 00:58:32,125
Are you not coming?

801
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:35,916
No, I got some things to do
before we go home.

802
00:58:37,958 --> 00:58:40,291
Can't we go do them after I see Mama?

803
00:58:41,625 --> 00:58:43,125
No, you go on, I'll be back.

804
00:58:46,458 --> 00:58:47,541
Go on.

805
00:58:56,791 --> 00:58:59,208
<i>...stand on the verge</i>
<i>of a big breakthrough.</i>

806
00:58:59,375 --> 00:59:03,458
<i>God has said in the next few years,
we stand on the verge of paradise.</i>

807
00:59:04,041 --> 00:59:05,500
<i>But there's something wrong.</i>

808
00:59:05,833 --> 00:59:08,750
<i>And I'm gonna tell you,
we've got to have prayer power</i>

809
00:59:08,833 --> 00:59:10,916
<i>and spiritual power.</i>

810
00:59:11,416 --> 00:59:14,000
<i>In south Vietnam,
soldiers fight with arms.</i>

811
00:59:14,083 --> 00:59:15,291
<i>But now our spirit...</i>

812
00:59:37,708 --> 00:59:39,208
Who is it out there?

813
00:59:41,708 --> 00:59:43,875
Lenora Laferty, Preacher Teagardin.

814
00:59:44,541 --> 00:59:45,791
Girl, you been crying?

815
00:59:46,291 --> 00:59:47,291
It's nothing.

816
00:59:48,666 --> 00:59:50,708
I just get down sometimes...

817
00:59:52,208 --> 00:59:53,125
Uh...

818
00:59:55,166 --> 00:59:57,166
The kids at school, they like to tease,

819
00:59:57,250 --> 00:59:59,833
and I ain't gonna have family there
come next year.

820
01:00:01,666 --> 01:00:03,458
I was like you when I was your age.

821
01:00:05,541 --> 01:00:06,666
Full of the Lord.

822
01:00:07,958 --> 01:00:11,208
Some of them other kids just...
came down hard on me.

823
01:00:12,458 --> 01:00:13,833
What did you do about it?

824
01:00:16,541 --> 01:00:17,375
Well...

825
01:00:18,541 --> 01:00:19,791
it was a rough time.

826
01:00:20,833 --> 01:00:22,041
They was just jealous.

827
01:00:23,666 --> 01:00:24,541
Envy.

828
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:27,083
Brings out the worst in people.

829
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:30,250
Especially the young ones.

830
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,708
I don't know
if you have anywhere you gotta be.

831
01:00:38,416 --> 01:00:39,333
But, uh...

832
01:00:40,250 --> 01:00:41,625
maybe we can take a drive.

833
01:00:42,791 --> 01:00:46,250
There's a quiet place I found
I like to go and pray on things.

834
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,250
<i>Like his father years before,</i>

835
01:01:05,333 --> 01:01:08,250
<i>Arvin had always been careful
about picking his time.</i>

836
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:13,208
<i>He knew he'd stand a better chance</i>

837
01:01:13,291 --> 01:01:16,291
<i>if he didn't try to take on
all the dirty bastards at once.</i>

838
01:01:23,541 --> 01:01:25,375
What was that?

839
01:01:28,083 --> 01:01:30,416
Nothing.
It must not have got shut all the way.

840
01:01:31,541 --> 01:01:33,416
Let's get them bloomers off, come on.

841
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:35,250
You... Close that door!

842
01:01:37,958 --> 01:01:39,416
Goddamn better be worth it.

843
01:01:47,291 --> 01:01:48,916
You piece of shit!

844
01:01:50,166 --> 01:01:51,125
Stop it!

845
01:01:51,208 --> 01:01:52,958
Motherfucker!

846
01:01:54,833 --> 01:01:58,041
Hey, Orville, will you start it up, man?
I don't think it's the spark plugs.

847
01:02:02,208 --> 01:02:03,291
Hey...

848
01:02:05,166 --> 01:02:07,916
No. Hey, Gene, you want another Twinkie?

849
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,250
I'm all right, thank you.

850
01:02:12,625 --> 01:02:13,875
Wait...

851
01:02:14,708 --> 01:02:17,750
Wait! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

852
01:02:19,833 --> 01:02:23,541
Want your fuckin' Twinkie now?
Is that what you want?

853
01:02:25,375 --> 01:02:26,208
No!

854
01:02:46,083 --> 01:02:47,500
You touch my sister again...

855
01:02:48,666 --> 01:02:49,666
I'll kill you.

856
01:02:50,166 --> 01:02:51,250
Do you understand me?

857
01:02:51,333 --> 01:02:52,333
Yes.

858
01:02:52,416 --> 01:02:55,375
- Do you understand me?
- I'm so sorry.

859
01:03:32,875 --> 01:03:35,125
Now, we can feel the Lord our here,
can't we?

860
01:03:40,916 --> 01:03:43,125
It's kind of you to come all this way.

861
01:03:53,625 --> 01:03:54,458
Lenora...

862
01:03:56,875 --> 01:03:59,583
have you truly opened yourself
to the Lord with...

863
01:04:00,541 --> 01:04:02,416
Preacher Sykes or...

864
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:04,666
any other preacher?

865
01:04:08,041 --> 01:04:08,875
Once...

866
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:12,708
Reverend Sykes wept with me.

867
01:04:12,791 --> 01:04:13,750
Hmm.

868
01:04:15,125 --> 01:04:16,416
That's not my meaning.

869
01:04:17,625 --> 01:04:19,125
Have you shown yourself

870
01:04:19,750 --> 01:04:21,166
as the Lord made you?

871
01:04:25,708 --> 01:04:27,541
You mean in my birthday suit? No.

872
01:04:28,916 --> 01:04:30,416
- No?
- No.

873
01:04:31,416 --> 01:04:32,791
To show yourself

874
01:04:33,250 --> 01:04:35,416
as the Lord made his first children,

875
01:04:35,916 --> 01:04:38,166
is to truly turn yourself to him...

876
01:04:39,583 --> 01:04:41,208
and his witnessing of it.

877
01:04:42,625 --> 01:04:44,166
Now, that's courage itself.

878
01:04:50,541 --> 01:04:52,083
Meaning I take off my clothes?

879
01:04:55,541 --> 01:04:57,125
Come on and pray with me.

880
01:04:59,666 --> 01:05:03,958
Lord, Lenora is showing herself to you.

881
01:05:04,041 --> 01:05:05,875
See her, Lord,

882
01:05:05,958 --> 01:05:07,500
as you made her.

883
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:09,833
She presents herself to you now.

884
01:05:10,333 --> 01:05:12,083
Give her the strength.

885
01:05:52,583 --> 01:05:53,916
We are together

886
01:05:55,416 --> 01:05:56,666
before the Lord.

887
01:05:58,875 --> 01:05:59,916
Amen.

888
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,041
Amen.

889
01:06:21,250 --> 01:06:22,708
Sorry I didn't come today.

890
01:06:23,583 --> 01:06:24,583
It's okay.

891
01:06:25,416 --> 01:06:27,916
I know there's other things
you wanna be doing probably.

892
01:06:31,333 --> 01:06:33,958
So, I can come on my own from now on.

893
01:06:43,291 --> 01:06:45,333
<i> Like her mother years ago,</i>

894
01:06:45,416 --> 01:06:49,375
<i>Lenora felt the same force
that drew Helen to Roy Laferty.</i>

895
01:06:50,250 --> 01:06:54,875
<i>The girl imagined that she could touch
the love emanating from the preacher.</i>

896
01:07:14,916 --> 01:07:17,958
Thirty-three to Athens,
50 to Clarksville...

897
01:07:19,291 --> 01:07:21,666
Seventy-nine North to Pittsburgh.

898
01:07:23,875 --> 01:07:26,166
Thirty-three, 50, 79.

899
01:07:27,708 --> 01:07:30,083
Thirty-three, 50, 79.

900
01:07:30,583 --> 01:07:32,666
Thirty-three, 50, 79.

901
01:07:33,250 --> 01:07:34,416
Fuck you, Carl!

902
01:07:42,083 --> 01:07:43,083
Shit.

903
01:07:44,958 --> 01:07:45,875
Shit.

904
01:07:53,041 --> 01:07:55,708
<i> It was the summer of 1965,</i>

905
01:07:55,791 --> 01:08:00,041
<i>and the couple were getting ready for what
would be their fourteenth road trip.</i>

906
01:08:02,041 --> 01:08:04,333
<i>Carl had decided long ago</i>

907
01:08:04,458 --> 01:08:07,500
<i>that young, good-looking hitchhikers
were the best.</i>

908
01:08:09,041 --> 01:08:11,583
What the fuck is going on out here?

909
01:08:13,583 --> 01:08:14,625
Couldn't sleep.

910
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:18,625
And you went outside for...

911
01:08:20,375 --> 01:08:22,666
Thought I'd pack the limousine early.

912
01:08:27,791 --> 01:08:30,625
We don't pack early, Sandy, that's a rule.

913
01:08:34,375 --> 01:08:35,833
- You fucking around?
- No.

914
01:08:35,916 --> 01:08:37,083
- Work?
- No.

915
01:08:42,333 --> 01:08:44,541
I gotta go into town
for business tomorrow.

916
01:08:46,958 --> 01:08:49,375
Think I wanna drive around
in a car full of bags?

917
01:08:50,958 --> 01:08:52,833
Buying a camera ain't business.

918
01:08:56,041 --> 01:08:56,958
Hmm.

919
01:09:49,250 --> 01:09:51,000
I'm coming, God dammit!

920
01:09:53,208 --> 01:09:55,625
- I'll break in if you don't answer.
- Jesus.

921
01:10:02,583 --> 01:10:04,666
- You don't look too good.
- I was asleep.

922
01:10:05,958 --> 01:10:07,083
What do you want?

923
01:10:09,625 --> 01:10:11,083
Huh?

924
01:10:13,208 --> 01:10:14,458
What are you looking for?

925
01:10:16,333 --> 01:10:18,375
Stop tearing my damn kitchen apart.

926
01:10:18,458 --> 01:10:19,625
You got any candy?

927
01:10:19,708 --> 01:10:22,666
Jane got you sober again?

928
01:10:27,625 --> 01:10:28,791
Going somewhere?

929
01:10:29,458 --> 01:10:31,625
Not that it's any of your business,
big brother,

930
01:10:31,708 --> 01:10:33,541
but I'm going on a little vacation.

931
01:10:33,625 --> 01:10:34,833
North Carolina.

932
01:10:41,166 --> 01:10:42,458
Why are you here, Lee?

933
01:10:51,541 --> 01:10:53,166
Hmm?

934
01:10:55,958 --> 01:10:58,458
I've been getting a lot of calls
from people about

935
01:10:58,541 --> 01:11:00,666
girls that someone snatched
out of Tecumseh.

936
01:11:01,958 --> 01:11:04,166
They even mentioned your name
a couple times.

937
01:11:04,250 --> 01:11:05,166
That's horseshit.

938
01:11:10,250 --> 01:11:12,333
I got another election coming up, Sandy.

939
01:11:13,583 --> 01:11:17,208
Ol' Matthew's out there doing anything
he can to try to make me look bad.

940
01:11:19,375 --> 01:11:22,000
Is Carl the one pimping you?
That fat son of a bitch?

941
01:11:22,083 --> 01:11:24,208
No, he's working, making deliveries.

942
01:11:29,875 --> 01:11:31,000
Deliveries?

943
01:11:32,458 --> 01:11:33,583
For who?

944
01:11:33,666 --> 01:11:34,875
Hell if I know.

945
01:11:35,583 --> 01:11:38,375
But he's bringing home money
that I don't gotta ask you for.

946
01:11:40,291 --> 01:11:41,291
Is it Leroy?

947
01:11:44,291 --> 01:11:45,833
Get the fuck out of here, Lee.

948
01:11:47,833 --> 01:11:49,708
Son of a bitch has it coming.

949
01:11:53,958 --> 01:11:57,375
Just leave off the horn
until after the election, you understand?

950
01:11:59,208 --> 01:12:01,458
Don't act like you do nothing wrong.

951
01:12:16,583 --> 01:12:18,833
I'm the law around here, little sister.

952
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,708
And that makes all the difference.

953
01:12:30,833 --> 01:12:32,416
<i>Cody Hamilton,</i>

954
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:37,000
<i>a 20-year-old carpenter out fishing
early one morning in West Virginia.</i>

955
01:12:37,083 --> 01:12:39,250
What the fuck are you doing, Sandy?

956
01:12:50,208 --> 01:12:52,583
Hey, Lee. Sandy's off.

957
01:13:00,083 --> 01:13:03,916
Leroy's private space
owns up half this dump.

958
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,916
I'm gonna inspect those whore rooms.

959
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,916
Lee, ain't nothin' there.

960
01:13:11,375 --> 01:13:12,333
Let me by.

961
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:14,916
Lawman.

962
01:13:31,458 --> 01:13:34,583
When the man who puts extra money
in your pockets asks why you're as red

963
01:13:34,666 --> 01:13:35,833
as a newborn baby,

964
01:13:36,333 --> 01:13:38,083
you tell him who the whore is.

965
01:13:46,041 --> 01:13:48,916
<i>Bodecker believed</i>
<i>people were like dogs:</i>

966
01:13:49,375 --> 01:13:52,250
<i>once they start digging,
they don't wanna stop.</i>

967
01:13:53,833 --> 01:13:57,333
<i>First, it would just be
that the Sheriff had a whore for a sister,</i>

968
01:13:58,125 --> 01:14:01,375
<i>and after that, all the bribes
and other shit that had piled up</i>

969
01:14:01,458 --> 01:14:03,333
<i>since he'd first pinned on a badge.</i>

970
01:14:04,250 --> 01:14:06,166
<i>And if he wasn't careful,</i>

971
01:14:06,250 --> 01:14:10,250
<i>eventually someone would find out
about his own dealings with Leroy.</i>

972
01:14:10,458 --> 01:14:12,041
My boy, my boy.

973
01:14:14,875 --> 01:14:17,000
- It's been a while.
- Yeah.

974
01:14:17,625 --> 01:14:20,958
- Whatcha having, honey?
- Coffee. Ain't staying long.

975
01:14:22,541 --> 01:14:23,750
You got a new toy?

976
01:14:23,833 --> 01:14:25,666
It's an English firearm.

977
01:14:25,750 --> 01:14:26,750
It's really rare.

978
01:14:27,333 --> 01:14:28,625
It's got special bullets.

979
01:14:28,708 --> 01:14:29,916
Untraceable.

980
01:14:30,958 --> 01:14:32,125
Untraceable.

981
01:14:33,875 --> 01:14:34,875
Sorry!

982
01:14:36,250 --> 01:14:40,333
Word starts going around Sheriff's
got his eye on the girls at Tecumseh.

983
01:14:41,125 --> 01:14:42,958
That's gonna cost me my money.

984
01:14:44,250 --> 01:14:47,083
Me losing money
is gonna cost you your cut.

985
01:14:48,041 --> 01:14:49,708
It didn't have anything to do with you.

986
01:14:50,916 --> 01:14:51,875
It does now.

987
01:14:53,541 --> 01:14:56,708
Bobo, you ever go and beat the shit
outta someone I made my money off?

988
01:14:58,041 --> 01:14:58,916
No.

989
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:02,166
Never crossed my mind,
thinking about that.

990
01:15:05,791 --> 01:15:08,291
Guy running against me
is going door-to-door

991
01:15:08,375 --> 01:15:11,208
telling folk I look the other way
when it comes to Sandy.

992
01:15:13,708 --> 01:15:15,000
Bobo, don't eat my scraps.

993
01:15:16,375 --> 01:15:17,625
Give over the envelope.

994
01:15:34,708 --> 01:15:35,958
There's debt you owe me.

995
01:15:37,375 --> 01:15:39,500
What I'm gonna lose at the bar.

996
01:15:39,583 --> 01:15:40,750
Horse shit.

997
01:15:40,833 --> 01:15:42,416
You ain't losing nothing there.

998
01:15:43,041 --> 01:15:44,000
Yeah?

999
01:15:44,583 --> 01:15:47,208
And you know that
'cause you're a loaded diaper

1000
01:15:47,291 --> 01:15:49,208
like everyone else who works for me

1001
01:15:49,291 --> 01:15:51,750
or because all of Meade
knows you're dirty?

1002
01:16:01,166 --> 01:16:03,416
That's your weekly earnings
'til we're square.

1003
01:16:05,708 --> 01:16:07,708
Now, get the fuck out of my diner.

1004
01:16:09,666 --> 01:16:12,625
<i>Bodecker knew</i>
<i>that Leroy and his errand boy Bobo</i>

1005
01:16:12,708 --> 01:16:15,541
<i>would kill him soon enough
if he made any more trouble.</i>

1006
01:16:17,500 --> 01:16:19,500
<i>He had an election to think about</i>

1007
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:21,708
<i>and couldn't afford any liabilities.</i>

1008
01:16:22,416 --> 01:16:26,333
<i>My bar is off limits and so is</i>
<i>your whore sister, you understand?</i>

1009
01:16:27,875 --> 01:16:29,416
<i>Thanks for stopping.</i>

1010
01:16:40,666 --> 01:16:43,875
- What's your name, sweetie?
- Private Gary Matthew Bryson.

1011
01:16:44,375 --> 01:16:45,750
That's a nice name.

1012
01:16:46,458 --> 01:16:50,208
You sound like you're at roll call.
Relax, boy.

1013
01:16:50,291 --> 01:16:52,000
Which of them you go by?

1014
01:16:52,083 --> 01:16:55,875
Gary. That was my dad's name,
so at home, I'm Gary Matthew.

1015
01:16:55,958 --> 01:16:58,333
Matthew?
That's from the Bible, ain't it, Carl?

1016
01:16:58,416 --> 01:17:00,416
Everything's from the Bible, honey.

1017
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:02,916
Hell, Ol' Matthew,
he's one of the Apostles.

1018
01:17:03,416 --> 01:17:06,041
You probably knew your name
came out of the Bible, didn't you?

1019
01:17:07,541 --> 01:17:10,125
We didn't go to church much
when I was a kid.

1020
01:17:11,083 --> 01:17:12,708
But you've been baptized, right?

1021
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:14,791
Of course.

1022
01:17:14,875 --> 01:17:16,041
We ain't heathens.

1023
01:17:16,125 --> 01:17:18,250
I just don't know much
about the Bible is all.

1024
01:17:18,750 --> 01:17:19,625
Good.

1025
01:17:21,666 --> 01:17:24,375
Lord knows where a person
who ain't saved might end up.

1026
01:17:25,041 --> 01:17:27,166
Hm... Right now it looks like Vietnam.

1027
01:17:30,541 --> 01:17:34,958
It's beautiful, isn't it?
All them trees just going up, up, up.

1028
01:17:36,208 --> 01:17:37,583
That's a good picture.

1029
01:17:38,791 --> 01:17:39,791
Sure is.

1030
01:17:41,625 --> 01:17:43,208
You're a nice boy, Gary.

1031
01:17:48,458 --> 01:17:50,416
Thanks for inviting me to lunch.

1032
01:17:57,458 --> 01:17:58,750
What do you say we eat, huh?

1033
01:17:59,500 --> 01:18:01,083
What do you want, Gary?

1034
01:18:01,166 --> 01:18:02,583
Uh, bologna's good.

1035
01:18:02,666 --> 01:18:04,875
Bologna? You want cheese?

1036
01:18:05,666 --> 01:18:06,625
Yes, please.

1037
01:18:07,166 --> 01:18:08,041
Okay.

1038
01:18:13,166 --> 01:18:14,750
Thank you.

1039
01:18:15,250 --> 01:18:16,416
Here you go, hon.

1040
01:18:27,833 --> 01:18:28,833
Gary?

1041
01:18:30,083 --> 01:18:31,208
Oh, no, thank you.

1042
01:18:31,291 --> 01:18:32,500
You don't drink?

1043
01:18:32,583 --> 01:18:34,083
I don't hold it very well.

1044
01:18:34,625 --> 01:18:36,125
Usually gets me in trouble.

1045
01:18:36,708 --> 01:18:37,625
Well, come on.

1046
01:18:38,708 --> 01:18:40,791
You mean to tell me
you're not gonna have a drink

1047
01:18:40,875 --> 01:18:42,458
with a pretty little thing like her?

1048
01:18:46,708 --> 01:18:48,125
Oh, what the hell.

1049
01:18:48,208 --> 01:18:49,125
Yeah.

1050
01:18:52,041 --> 01:18:53,541
Whoo! That'll wake you up.

1051
01:18:55,208 --> 01:18:57,333
- Here.
- No, you go on and take another one.

1052
01:18:59,083 --> 01:19:00,708
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1053
01:19:05,791 --> 01:19:06,833
I got an idea.

1054
01:19:08,583 --> 01:19:10,666
Seeing as we might not
see one another again...

1055
01:19:12,166 --> 01:19:14,291
we oughta record this for posterity.

1056
01:19:18,166 --> 01:19:20,666
- You mean a picture?
- Damn right, I mean a picture.

1057
01:19:20,750 --> 01:19:22,541
- Sure, I'm game.
- That's the spirit.

1058
01:19:23,041 --> 01:19:26,208
I'll tell you what, Private.
Why don't you just...

1059
01:19:26,291 --> 01:19:29,166
lie down on that blanket there
on your side.

1060
01:19:30,250 --> 01:19:31,333
Like that?

1061
01:19:31,416 --> 01:19:32,416
Like that.

1062
01:19:33,416 --> 01:19:35,375
Now, take that bottle and hold it

1063
01:19:35,916 --> 01:19:37,750
like you got it on you all the time.

1064
01:19:40,250 --> 01:19:41,208
How's that?

1065
01:20:18,833 --> 01:20:22,000
- You're snoozing through Ferlin.
- I don't like this gospel shit.

1066
01:20:28,458 --> 01:20:29,666
You know, we did him a favor.

1067
01:20:29,750 --> 01:20:32,583
He was just gonna get shot up
and killed in Vietnam anyways.

1068
01:20:36,208 --> 01:20:37,291
God dammit.

1069
01:20:37,958 --> 01:20:40,875
- He wasn't nothing but another model.
- I told you I don't like this anymore.

1070
01:20:40,958 --> 01:20:43,250
Ain't it fair
if I hate the way some of 'em cry?

1071
01:20:43,333 --> 01:20:44,500
Not that you'd appreciate it,

1072
01:20:44,583 --> 01:20:46,875
but tears make for a good photograph.

1073
01:20:47,375 --> 01:20:49,416
<i>What Sandy didn't understand</i>

1074
01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:51,458
<i>was that to his way of thinking,</i>

1075
01:20:51,541 --> 01:20:53,250
<i>this was the one true religion.</i>

1076
01:20:54,416 --> 01:20:56,375
<i>Only in the presence of death</i>

1077
01:20:56,875 --> 01:20:59,750
<i>could he feel the presence
of something like God.</i>

1078
01:20:59,833 --> 01:21:00,916
No, no, no!

1079
01:21:02,166 --> 01:21:05,041
Please! Please! Please!

1080
01:21:06,541 --> 01:21:09,791
Don't you... Don't you touch
that fuckin' camera there, son.

1081
01:21:13,333 --> 01:21:14,583
<i>The sick fuck.</i>

1082
01:21:14,666 --> 01:21:16,291
How about we check into a motel?

1083
01:21:17,041 --> 01:21:20,125
Get a couple of steaks,
and relax for a day or two.

1084
01:21:20,208 --> 01:21:21,291
How does that sound?

1085
01:21:23,375 --> 01:21:26,916
Private Gary Matthew Bryson
won't be reporting to Fort Eustis.

1086
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,750
But he ain't a coward,
he went and got himself killed.

1087
01:21:30,583 --> 01:21:32,541
Buried by the Mechums River
in West Virginia.

1088
01:21:32,625 --> 01:21:34,333
Chopped up pretty bad in a suitcase.

1089
01:21:35,416 --> 01:21:37,166
No, I won't speak to nobody else.

1090
01:21:47,416 --> 01:21:48,875
I've heard of cases

1091
01:21:49,375 --> 01:21:51,250
in my reading

1092
01:21:51,333 --> 01:21:53,500
about sin

1093
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:58,166
where someone got so sick...

1094
01:21:59,666 --> 01:22:01,291
over some sin

1095
01:22:01,791 --> 01:22:03,791
they felt

1096
01:22:03,875 --> 01:22:07,125
they had committed that was so terrible

1097
01:22:07,625 --> 01:22:08,541
that they...

1098
01:22:10,125 --> 01:22:13,125
started imagining things.

1099
01:22:15,333 --> 01:22:17,541
Back, I read a story about...

1100
01:22:18,708 --> 01:22:19,750
people.

1101
01:22:20,333 --> 01:22:21,333
Poor people.

1102
01:22:22,791 --> 01:22:23,708
Barely

1103
01:22:24,416 --> 01:22:25,833
able to write...

1104
01:22:27,250 --> 01:22:28,375
thinking they're...

1105
01:22:29,166 --> 01:22:30,291
the president

1106
01:22:30,916 --> 01:22:31,958
or...

1107
01:22:32,833 --> 01:22:35,666
or a Hollywood celebrity

1108
01:22:35,750 --> 01:22:38,041
like Ava Gardner.

1109
01:22:42,083 --> 01:22:43,583
I...

1110
01:22:49,291 --> 01:22:52,166
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

1111
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:56,333
The thing is, that's the part of it.

1112
01:22:57,250 --> 01:22:58,458
The book says...

1113
01:22:59,708 --> 01:23:00,750
it's not,

1114
01:23:01,375 --> 01:23:02,958
not understanding.

1115
01:23:04,166 --> 01:23:05,583
See, think about it.

1116
01:23:06,708 --> 01:23:07,791
How...

1117
01:23:09,083 --> 01:23:10,250
could I be

1118
01:23:10,750 --> 01:23:11,750
the daddy...

1119
01:23:12,666 --> 01:23:15,666
when all we done
is spend time with the Lord?

1120
01:23:20,708 --> 01:23:21,875
Late night?

1121
01:23:24,250 --> 01:23:27,958
Played cards
over at Elder Stubbs's garage again.

1122
01:23:28,708 --> 01:23:30,000
You win this time?

1123
01:23:32,375 --> 01:23:33,916
No, not really.

1124
01:23:37,708 --> 01:23:40,000
Saw Fred Dinwoodie over there.

1125
01:23:40,083 --> 01:23:42,458
He said his boy is just about healed up.

1126
01:23:44,333 --> 01:23:46,916
I still think
you could have held back a little bit.

1127
01:23:48,458 --> 01:23:50,541
Well, he ain't bothered Lenora since.

1128
01:23:51,916 --> 01:23:53,750
Him or his candy-ass buddies.

1129
01:23:54,416 --> 01:23:57,416
I gotta go check in on her.
She ain't been feeling too good.

1130
01:23:58,166 --> 01:24:00,833
You keep an eye on her for me
while we're at church.

1131
01:24:05,125 --> 01:24:08,750
<i>Lenora had stopped asking Arvin</i>
<i>to join her at Helen's grave.</i>

1132
01:24:09,333 --> 01:24:10,791
<i>He didn't mind much.</i>

1133
01:24:11,291 --> 01:24:13,416
<i>His mind
would always drift back to Willard</i>

1134
01:24:13,500 --> 01:24:16,166
<i>and the prayer log and his poor dog Jack.</i>

1135
01:24:17,625 --> 01:24:20,666
<i>Besides, he'd gotten a job
working on the road crew</i>

1136
01:24:20,833 --> 01:24:22,625
<i>and was busy making some money.</i>

1137
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,208
I never missed church before.

1138
01:24:35,250 --> 01:24:36,833
I'm so ashamed.

1139
01:24:39,500 --> 01:24:41,541
You ain't got nothing to be ashamed of.

1140
01:24:41,625 --> 01:24:44,625
I'm sure the Lord will forgive you
for missing one Sunday.

1141
01:24:45,791 --> 01:24:48,625
Ol' Jesus probably had
his fair share of bad mornings.

1142
01:24:54,333 --> 01:24:55,791
I love you, Arvin.

1143
01:25:06,125 --> 01:25:07,750
How's about we, uh...

1144
01:25:08,333 --> 01:25:10,500
Go see your mama's grave
when you're better?

1145
01:25:13,291 --> 01:25:14,375
Sound all right?

1146
01:25:17,041 --> 01:25:18,666
<i>The good book...</i>

1147
01:25:18,750 --> 01:25:21,458
<i>is filled with good men</i>

1148
01:25:22,125 --> 01:25:23,375
<i>and women</i>

1149
01:25:23,458 --> 01:25:25,458
suffering delusions.

1150
01:25:27,083 --> 01:25:28,666
Eve in the garden.

1151
01:25:29,916 --> 01:25:30,916
Noah...

1152
01:25:31,500 --> 01:25:33,208
naked, drunk.

1153
01:25:33,875 --> 01:25:35,958
Bringing shame upon his family.

1154
01:25:37,416 --> 01:25:40,041
The idol
the Jews bowed before in the desert.

1155
01:25:43,458 --> 01:25:47,125
And even the Lord Jesus himself
was presented with delusions in the desert

1156
01:25:47,208 --> 01:25:49,500
that only through his faith...

1157
01:25:50,125 --> 01:25:51,500
and his strength...

1158
01:25:52,125 --> 01:25:53,791
- overcame.
- Mm-hmm.

1159
01:25:54,291 --> 01:25:55,500
Praise Jesus.

1160
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:01,041
The Lord's delusion in the desert
was a game...

1161
01:26:02,708 --> 01:26:05,458
of the so-called "Devil."

1162
01:26:08,166 --> 01:26:10,458
And what the Lord experienced...

1163
01:26:11,541 --> 01:26:15,041
was a delusion
that would've kept him from saving us!

1164
01:26:15,541 --> 01:26:17,875
But he did not fall for it!

1165
01:26:20,333 --> 01:26:22,583
<i>It is our delusions</i>

1166
01:26:22,666 --> 01:26:24,541
<i>that lead us to sin.</i>

1167
01:26:27,083 --> 01:26:30,958
<i>Striking a mother or a wife
for something that you thought they said.</i>

1168
01:26:32,750 --> 01:26:35,833
Neglecting work or Sunday service,
for that matter.

1169
01:26:35,916 --> 01:26:37,541
Right. You said it.

1170
01:26:38,375 --> 01:26:39,583
Some girl...

1171
01:26:40,250 --> 01:26:43,583
gets a feeling for a fella
and lets him have her holy gift.

1172
01:26:47,875 --> 01:26:49,750
Delusions!

1173
01:26:51,041 --> 01:26:55,166
Blaspheming the Lord
in your mind and in your heart

1174
01:26:55,250 --> 01:26:58,500
for some wrong done to you
by another person.

1175
01:26:58,583 --> 01:26:59,666
That's true.

1176
01:27:02,583 --> 01:27:03,958
You're saying you don't...

1177
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,833
remember all the things
we did in your car?

1178
01:27:11,500 --> 01:27:13,166
I'm saying you must be crazy.

1179
01:27:13,250 --> 01:27:16,750
Coming in the Lord's house
and talking all this trash.

1180
01:27:19,458 --> 01:27:21,458
<i>Look, my advice to you, girl...</i>

1181
01:27:23,458 --> 01:27:25,208
<i>is you figure some way to get rid of it.</i>

1182
01:27:26,666 --> 01:27:28,041
'Cause otherwise...

1183
01:27:29,041 --> 01:27:32,500
it's gonna be you, a whore mother,

1184
01:27:33,500 --> 01:27:36,500
<i>and her little bastard child
running around,</i>

1185
01:27:36,583 --> 01:27:39,833
<i>living in that poor old woman's house
who raised you.</i>

1186
01:27:41,625 --> 01:27:44,125
If nothing else, think of her.

1187
01:27:44,791 --> 01:27:47,041
She'll die from the shame of it all.

1188
01:27:59,625 --> 01:28:00,708
Come on.

1189
01:28:17,333 --> 01:28:18,208
Come on.

1190
01:28:33,375 --> 01:28:36,458
<i>Lenora suddenly knew</i>
<i>she was making a mistake.</i>

1191
01:28:37,916 --> 01:28:39,791
<i>Grandma wouldn't be ashamed</i>

1192
01:28:40,375 --> 01:28:42,791
<i>and she and her baby would be okay.</i>

1193
01:29:00,708 --> 01:29:02,583
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

1194
01:29:02,708 --> 01:29:05,000
No! No! No!

1195
01:29:05,083 --> 01:29:06,250
Grandma!

1196
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:08,166
Grandma!

1197
01:29:08,333 --> 01:29:10,208
No, no, no!

1198
01:29:13,250 --> 01:29:14,458
Grandma!

1199
01:29:19,500 --> 01:29:20,958
Grandma!

1200
01:29:23,375 --> 01:29:26,166
<i>No one would know</i>
<i>she wasn't a suicide</i>

1201
01:29:26,541 --> 01:29:29,875
<i>and that in the end,
she was all right with her maker.</i>

1202
01:29:30,333 --> 01:29:31,416
Oh, Lord.

1203
01:29:33,958 --> 01:29:36,458
There's just some things
we can't understand.

1204
01:29:40,291 --> 01:29:42,333
But you take her into your arms.

1205
01:29:50,083 --> 01:29:51,375
Uh, ain't somebody...

1206
01:29:52,875 --> 01:29:54,250
saying prayers or...

1207
01:30:32,041 --> 01:30:33,833
Need to have a word with you, Arvin.

1208
01:30:33,916 --> 01:30:35,750
- All right, see ya, buddy.
- Yep.

1209
01:30:35,833 --> 01:30:36,833
See ya tomorrow.

1210
01:30:37,333 --> 01:30:38,458
About what?

1211
01:30:40,875 --> 01:30:41,958
It's, uh...

1212
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:46,208
It's about Lenora.

1213
01:30:50,791 --> 01:30:51,791
What about her?

1214
01:30:54,625 --> 01:30:57,250
I came by here instead of home
so nothing's...

1215
01:30:57,958 --> 01:30:59,250
put on your grandmother.

1216
01:31:00,958 --> 01:31:02,333
"Put on"? What do you mean?

1217
01:31:03,875 --> 01:31:04,791
Well...

1218
01:31:07,416 --> 01:31:09,333
ol' Dudley, in the Coroner's...

1219
01:31:10,333 --> 01:31:12,000
I ain't never heard of no Dudley.

1220
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,541
Well, he's a drunk...
but he ain't no liar.

1221
01:31:17,750 --> 01:31:20,291
Did you know Lenora was carrying a baby?

1222
01:31:26,458 --> 01:31:27,625
That's bullshit.

1223
01:31:28,541 --> 01:31:30,125
That son of a bitch is lying.

1224
01:31:31,708 --> 01:31:32,708
I tell ya...

1225
01:31:33,875 --> 01:31:35,166
Dudley ain't a liar.

1226
01:31:36,458 --> 01:31:39,708
He came to me privately
so as your family knew.

1227
01:31:40,541 --> 01:31:41,791
I felt he was right.

1228
01:31:47,458 --> 01:31:50,541
Now, I might've put my foot
in something. It...

1229
01:31:51,166 --> 01:31:52,625
wasn't my intentions.

1230
01:31:55,666 --> 01:31:58,250
You know that preacher
ain't said no words for her.

1231
01:32:00,541 --> 01:32:02,458
Not for people that kill themselves.

1232
01:34:11,083 --> 01:34:12,000
Uncle...

1233
01:34:12,083 --> 01:34:15,375
<i>Arvin wanted so much</i>
<i>to be able to tell them goodbye,</i>

1234
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,708
<i>but they would be better off
not knowing anything</i>

1235
01:34:18,791 --> 01:34:20,833
<i>if the law came looking for him.</i>

1236
01:34:20,916 --> 01:34:22,708
You have to be good to Grandma.

1237
01:34:26,625 --> 01:34:29,750
You know that she ain't hardly been out
of her bed since the funeral?

1238
01:34:30,666 --> 01:34:31,583
Yeah.

1239
01:34:32,833 --> 01:34:34,041
Grandma needs you.

1240
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:36,958
All right?

1241
01:35:35,208 --> 01:35:36,375
<i>Dear Grandma...</i>

1242
01:35:37,166 --> 01:35:40,625
<i>I'm writing to you
because I cannot say goodbye to your face.</i>

1243
01:35:41,333 --> 01:35:45,375
<i>I love you and I will always remember
the things that you have done for me.</i>

1244
01:35:46,500 --> 01:35:49,666
<i>What I'm about to do,
I do because I have to,</i>

1245
01:35:49,750 --> 01:35:51,291
<i>not because I want to.</i>

1246
01:35:51,958 --> 01:35:53,833
<i>Please do not try and find me.</i>

1247
01:35:53,916 --> 01:35:56,375
<i>Love, your grandson, Arvin.</i>

1248
01:36:19,083 --> 01:36:20,125
Excuse me.

1249
01:36:24,125 --> 01:36:25,125
Excuse me.

1250
01:36:25,208 --> 01:36:26,250
Preacher?

1251
01:36:30,250 --> 01:36:31,750
Got time for a sinner?

1252
01:36:35,250 --> 01:36:38,125
I've been doing wrong
and I wanna get right by the Lord.

1253
01:36:42,541 --> 01:36:44,208
Well, that's what I'm here for.

1254
01:36:48,208 --> 01:36:49,125
I've done...

1255
01:36:51,250 --> 01:36:52,708
lustful acts.

1256
01:36:55,875 --> 01:36:56,833
Yeah.

1257
01:36:58,041 --> 01:37:00,000
That could be a big problem.

1258
01:37:00,666 --> 01:37:02,125
Especially for the young people.

1259
01:37:03,791 --> 01:37:05,208
Go on, tell me about it.

1260
01:37:07,041 --> 01:37:09,041
I got me a pretty wife at home.

1261
01:37:10,375 --> 01:37:12,791
One that'll do pretty much anything I ask.

1262
01:37:14,625 --> 01:37:16,083
But I treat her real bad.

1263
01:37:17,833 --> 01:37:19,416
Well, when you say anything,

1264
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:21,208
what do you mean?

1265
01:37:23,583 --> 01:37:24,791
Just what I said.

1266
01:37:26,791 --> 01:37:30,208
Sometimes she'll be going down
on me with...

1267
01:37:32,875 --> 01:37:34,375
Well, you know, her mouth.

1268
01:37:36,250 --> 01:37:38,833
Heck, I get so excited I start forcing it.

1269
01:37:43,208 --> 01:37:44,666
She ever puke on you?

1270
01:37:46,541 --> 01:37:49,333
They got a little trigger,
back there in their throat.

1271
01:37:51,125 --> 01:37:52,833
Yeah, well, that ain't my problem.

1272
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:55,833
Well, what's the problem then, son?

1273
01:38:00,541 --> 01:38:03,250
This guy I work with
has got himself a daughter.

1274
01:38:04,791 --> 01:38:07,791
Real young thing,
just started high school.

1275
01:38:11,208 --> 01:38:14,500
One day I got this girl in my truck
and I drove her out into the sticks

1276
01:38:14,583 --> 01:38:15,625
and I...

1277
01:38:17,416 --> 01:38:18,750
had my way with her.

1278
01:38:22,708 --> 01:38:24,250
Did she put up a fight?

1279
01:38:26,541 --> 01:38:27,541
No.

1280
01:38:30,791 --> 01:38:32,541
But, you see, the problem is, is...

1281
01:38:34,625 --> 01:38:37,416
once I'd had a taste,
I just couldn't get enough.

1282
01:38:38,750 --> 01:38:41,208
I kept taking that girl there
any chance I got.

1283
01:38:43,458 --> 01:38:44,708
So I'd strip her clothes off.

1284
01:38:48,625 --> 01:38:50,833
But I'd make her pray
before we got started.

1285
01:38:58,583 --> 01:39:00,833
Why don't you take that hat off, boy.

1286
01:39:02,416 --> 01:39:03,500
Sometimes I'd even...

1287
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:05,333
keep her panties.

1288
01:39:07,791 --> 01:39:08,916
Now, I'd just...

1289
01:39:10,583 --> 01:39:12,875
sniff 'em as she rode off on her bike.

1290
01:39:15,125 --> 01:39:17,416
And then I'd go home
to that whore of a wife of mine

1291
01:39:17,500 --> 01:39:20,125
and make her bake me a cake
like I was celebrating.

1292
01:39:20,208 --> 01:39:21,875
What in the hell is this?

1293
01:39:21,958 --> 01:39:23,750
You've been spying on me, boy?

1294
01:39:28,625 --> 01:39:31,458
I've been watching your every move
for the last couple weeks.

1295
01:39:34,083 --> 01:39:36,375
You can't get enough
of that Reaster girl, can you?

1296
01:39:36,458 --> 01:39:38,958
Is that how you did my Lenora too?

1297
01:39:43,666 --> 01:39:44,625
So...

1298
01:39:45,708 --> 01:39:46,791
Mrs. Russell's boy?

1299
01:39:50,041 --> 01:39:51,041
All right.

1300
01:39:54,958 --> 01:39:57,041
Don't do anything you'll regret, son.

1301
01:39:57,708 --> 01:40:00,208
Why don't you put the gun down and...

1302
01:40:01,125 --> 01:40:02,708
we can talk all about it.

1303
01:40:03,333 --> 01:40:04,541
Go ahead and talk.

1304
01:40:10,416 --> 01:40:11,833
It wasn't my fault.

1305
01:40:14,750 --> 01:40:16,458
And Lenora...

1306
01:40:18,250 --> 01:40:19,500
was just like this...

1307
01:40:20,833 --> 01:40:22,000
this Reaster girl.

1308
01:40:23,458 --> 01:40:24,791
She wouldn't let me be.

1309
01:40:26,750 --> 01:40:29,875
But I want you to know that I...

1310
01:40:30,541 --> 01:40:33,333
I pray for that girl's soul

1311
01:40:33,416 --> 01:40:35,083
every night.

1312
01:40:35,833 --> 01:40:37,833
Do you pray for her baby's soul too?

1313
01:40:38,458 --> 01:40:40,541
Look, I didn't have...

1314
01:40:40,625 --> 01:40:42,125
nothing to do with that.

1315
01:40:43,500 --> 01:40:44,791
She came to me...

1316
01:40:45,291 --> 01:40:48,875
- saying she got that way from a boy...
- Don't fuckin' lie to me!

1317
01:40:49,666 --> 01:40:50,750
Lies...

1318
01:40:52,333 --> 01:40:53,541
The lies...

1319
01:40:54,291 --> 01:40:55,541
The lies are hers.

1320
01:40:57,458 --> 01:41:01,041
She got it in her head
that I was the father.

1321
01:41:01,541 --> 01:41:03,708
That I was gonna take care of everything.

1322
01:41:03,791 --> 01:41:05,416
God dammit, boy!

1323
01:41:05,916 --> 01:41:06,958
Listen to me!

1324
01:41:08,666 --> 01:41:12,458
I ain't gonna take the blame
for no bastard child!

1325
01:41:12,541 --> 01:41:14,000
It would ruin me, man.

1326
01:41:14,791 --> 01:41:16,583
You can understand that, can't you?

1327
01:41:17,125 --> 01:41:18,083
Hell!

1328
01:41:19,916 --> 01:41:21,041
Listen to me, boy.

1329
01:41:23,541 --> 01:41:25,541
She was...

1330
01:41:26,583 --> 01:41:27,583
delusional.

1331
01:41:29,791 --> 01:41:30,916
She was crazy.

1332
01:41:34,708 --> 01:41:35,666
You see?

1333
01:41:37,333 --> 01:41:38,875
No, she was just lonely.

1334
01:41:40,666 --> 01:41:41,625
No, man.

1335
01:41:49,583 --> 01:41:50,833
Please, God!

1336
01:41:51,708 --> 01:41:52,708
Please, God!

1337
01:41:59,541 --> 01:42:00,708
Fuck.

1338
01:42:06,291 --> 01:42:07,291
Fuck!

1339
01:42:09,625 --> 01:42:10,875
Shit.

1340
01:42:16,250 --> 01:42:17,250
Shit.

1341
01:42:48,500 --> 01:42:50,875
<i>He had to get away from this place</i>

1342
01:42:50,958 --> 01:42:52,875
<i>or any he ever called home.</i>

1343
01:42:53,833 --> 01:42:56,458
<i>But in this moment, he felt a sudden force</i>

1344
01:42:56,541 --> 01:42:58,875
<i>pulling in back towards Knockemstiff.</i>

1345
01:43:00,500 --> 01:43:02,250
<i>No matter what else happened,</i>

1346
01:43:02,333 --> 01:43:05,875
<i>he had to try to set right
those things about his father</i>

1347
01:43:05,958 --> 01:43:07,375
<i>that still ate at his heart.</i>

1348
01:43:44,916 --> 01:43:47,166
Come on.

1349
01:43:49,166 --> 01:43:50,000
Fuck.

1350
01:44:11,875 --> 01:44:13,208
Morning, Lee.

1351
01:44:13,291 --> 01:44:14,375
Heya, Bobo.

1352
01:44:16,125 --> 01:44:17,708
Sorry to come by so early.

1353
01:44:18,916 --> 01:44:21,500
I was on my way to work and...

1354
01:44:22,333 --> 01:44:23,958
I thought I might chew your ear.

1355
01:44:24,041 --> 01:44:24,916
Hm.

1356
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,166
Still thinking
about that gun you showed me.

1357
01:44:28,375 --> 01:44:31,583
Uh... I'm gonna scramble some eggs.
You want some?

1358
01:44:32,083 --> 01:44:32,916
Yeah.

1359
01:44:37,833 --> 01:44:39,541
I'll take coffee if you got any.

1360
01:44:40,208 --> 01:44:41,166
Coming up.

1361
01:44:44,125 --> 01:44:45,250
Leroy here?

1362
01:44:45,791 --> 01:44:46,833
He's upstairs.

1363
01:44:49,208 --> 01:44:50,875
Pistol's in the dining room.

1364
01:44:52,750 --> 01:44:53,750
Pretty nifty.

1365
01:45:07,791 --> 01:45:09,083
It's a fine piece.

1366
01:45:14,458 --> 01:45:16,708
Wonder if you'd consider selling me it.

1367
01:45:17,416 --> 01:45:19,250
Well, I just got it.

1368
01:45:19,750 --> 01:45:22,708
But everything's got a price, I guess.

1369
01:45:28,500 --> 01:45:31,041
You know,
one thing I never can get is the...

1370
01:45:31,833 --> 01:45:32,916
scoops and water.

1371
01:45:33,458 --> 01:45:35,791
Is it more water to scoops

1372
01:45:36,333 --> 01:45:38,875
or more scoops to water?

1373
01:45:45,500 --> 01:45:48,125
<i>Jackie DeShannon here on KBWB.</i>

1374
01:45:48,208 --> 01:45:50,791
<i>Jackie first toured with The Beatles...</i>

1375
01:45:50,875 --> 01:45:52,708
"Bobo, go there do this."

1376
01:45:52,791 --> 01:45:54,041
He goes there, does it.

1377
01:45:55,083 --> 01:45:57,041
He's simple.

1378
01:45:57,583 --> 01:45:58,500
You too.

1379
01:46:12,750 --> 01:46:13,791
Huh.

1380
01:46:17,291 --> 01:46:22,125
<i>...at Hopkins Automotive.</i>
<i>And now, for the WIXY sports scoreboard.</i>

1381
01:46:26,083 --> 01:46:27,166
Carl?

1382
01:46:28,083 --> 01:46:29,083
I see him.

1383
01:46:31,416 --> 01:46:32,291
Carl?

1384
01:46:35,083 --> 01:46:37,708
- We don't even know where he's going.
- Carl?

1385
01:46:37,791 --> 01:46:39,750
- Just...
- God dammit, Carl.

1386
01:46:39,833 --> 01:46:41,291
He's going to Ohio.

1387
01:46:41,375 --> 01:46:43,375
No one from home. That's your rule.

1388
01:46:47,083 --> 01:46:49,208
Let's just see where he's going, Sandy.

1389
01:46:53,333 --> 01:46:54,208
Morning.

1390
01:46:54,958 --> 01:46:55,916
Where you headed?

1391
01:46:56,416 --> 01:46:58,041
Meade, Ohio. You heard of it?

1392
01:47:00,666 --> 01:47:02,125
The paper-mill town, right?

1393
01:47:02,208 --> 01:47:03,333
Yeah, that's right.

1394
01:47:06,958 --> 01:47:08,791
We're passing right through it.

1395
01:47:11,708 --> 01:47:13,375
What you going to Meade for?

1396
01:47:13,916 --> 01:47:16,041
- Just visiting.
- Got family there?

1397
01:47:18,125 --> 01:47:20,791
No, I used to live there a long time ago.

1398
01:47:21,750 --> 01:47:25,375
Well, probably ain't changed much.
Little towns never do.

1399
01:47:28,083 --> 01:47:30,625
Where is it y'all live?

1400
01:47:30,708 --> 01:47:31,875
In Chesterfield.

1401
01:47:33,708 --> 01:47:35,708
We're headed up to Chicago, Illinois.

1402
01:47:37,375 --> 01:47:40,000
We like picking up strangers
along the way, don't we?

1403
01:47:40,083 --> 01:47:41,416
Meet new people, don't we, hon?

1404
01:47:43,125 --> 01:47:44,166
Sure do.

1405
01:47:45,250 --> 01:47:46,791
Oh, shit.

1406
01:47:47,416 --> 01:47:49,708
My old billy don't work like it used to.

1407
01:47:50,750 --> 01:47:52,166
I'm gonna have to...

1408
01:47:52,666 --> 01:47:54,875
Pull over and take a leak somewhere here.

1409
01:47:54,958 --> 01:47:56,333
Is that all right by you?

1410
01:47:57,833 --> 01:47:58,666
Sure.

1411
01:47:58,750 --> 01:48:01,416
There should be a road
somewhere up here on the right.

1412
01:48:03,791 --> 01:48:05,916
- Here?
- No, a little further.

1413
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,625
Little further. Slow down.
Turn in right here.

1414
01:48:08,708 --> 01:48:09,666
This is good.

1415
01:48:36,750 --> 01:48:37,958
Right here.

1416
01:48:38,500 --> 01:48:39,625
Yeah, this'll work.

1417
01:48:45,958 --> 01:48:47,083
I won't be long.

1418
01:49:12,208 --> 01:49:13,333
Oh, shoot.

1419
01:49:25,916 --> 01:49:28,458
Damn.
That's gonna be one fine sunset.

1420
01:49:29,125 --> 01:49:32,500
You have to be patient with me
while I get a few shots off.

1421
01:49:33,833 --> 01:49:34,916
Hon, give me the key.

1422
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,583
Don't you worry none.
We've got some hooch in the back and...

1423
01:49:39,875 --> 01:49:41,875
Well, Sandy's good company.

1424
01:49:50,791 --> 01:49:52,625
<i>The thought of killing Carl</i>

1425
01:49:52,708 --> 01:49:54,541
<i>and taking off
with the boy in the backseat</i>

1426
01:49:54,625 --> 01:49:56,291
<i>suddenly crossed Sandy's mind.</i>

1427
01:50:03,083 --> 01:50:06,791
<i>He was young, but that didn't mean
she couldn't make it work.</i>

1428
01:50:17,875 --> 01:50:19,916
Tell you what, son. Why don't you ste...

1429
01:50:23,958 --> 01:50:26,750
Shit!

1430
01:50:27,875 --> 01:50:29,791
No! Calm down, please!

1431
01:50:29,875 --> 01:50:31,791
I don't wanna shoot you! Put the gun down!

1432
01:50:32,458 --> 01:50:33,916
- I don't want to shoot.
- I'm so sorry!

1433
01:50:43,541 --> 01:50:45,625
Carl, you want sandals or heels?

1434
01:50:45,708 --> 01:50:46,625
Heels.

1435
01:50:49,333 --> 01:50:52,333
<i>Serial murderers</i>
<i>aren't the most trusting kind.</i>

1436
01:50:53,125 --> 01:50:57,166
<i>Carl brought the additional quality
of being maniacally paranoid.</i>

1437
01:50:59,166 --> 01:51:02,458
<i>Sandy's behavior
before they left home made him uneasy,</i>

1438
01:51:02,958 --> 01:51:07,166
<i>and Carl thought it'd be better if he was
the only one with a loaded weapon.</i>

1439
01:51:10,166 --> 01:51:12,291
<i>Poor Sandy never stood a chance.</i>

1440
01:51:16,583 --> 01:51:18,458
<i>Her gun was loaded with blanks.</i>

1441
01:51:42,083 --> 01:51:43,291
<i>Jim Lacey.</i>

1442
01:51:43,458 --> 01:51:45,208
<i>New Burlington, Indiana.</i>

1443
01:51:46,333 --> 01:51:49,416
<i>Carl never photographed
a more symmetrical face.</i>

1444
01:51:49,958 --> 01:51:52,375
<i>This photo really meant something to him.</i>

1445
01:51:52,708 --> 01:51:54,083
<i>Jim had been their first.</i>

1446
01:52:39,333 --> 01:52:42,333
<i>Sheriff Bodecker,</i>
<i>this is Deputy Howser. Come in. Over.</i>

1447
01:52:43,708 --> 01:52:44,666
<i>Sheriff, you there?</i>

1448
01:52:44,750 --> 01:52:48,250
<i>A farmer called in a double homicide
off the 506. I need you here.</i>

1449
01:52:59,125 --> 01:53:00,833
I'm sorry, Lee. This is fucked up.

1450
01:53:01,333 --> 01:53:02,291
What do you mean?

1451
01:53:02,875 --> 01:53:04,291
It's your sister and her husband.

1452
01:53:10,583 --> 01:53:12,041
Carl was shot twice.

1453
01:53:12,791 --> 01:53:13,875
Sandy once.

1454
01:53:17,500 --> 01:53:19,333
It looks like it was a nine millimeter.

1455
01:53:19,416 --> 01:53:21,083
Sandy got one shot off but...

1456
01:53:22,125 --> 01:53:23,708
her gun was loaded with blanks.

1457
01:53:31,375 --> 01:53:33,583
- Jesus Christ.
- Lee?

1458
01:53:37,958 --> 01:53:40,166
Give me a couple minutes here
alone with her.

1459
01:53:45,375 --> 01:53:47,958
<i>She'd always been</i>
<i>sort of fucked up,</i>

1460
01:53:48,041 --> 01:53:51,416
<i>but Lee blamed Carl
for the way she'd gone downhill.</i>

1461
01:53:52,125 --> 01:53:55,958
<i>Regardless of all that,
she was still his baby sister.</i>

1462
01:54:01,708 --> 01:54:05,208
<i>But the sheriff couldn't help but think
of his own situation for a moment.</i>

1463
01:54:06,041 --> 01:54:08,166
<i>He thought about that photo
he found of her</i>

1464
01:54:08,250 --> 01:54:10,458
<i>and worried about what else
people might find</i>

1465
01:54:10,541 --> 01:54:12,125
<i>if he didn't get to it first.</i>

1466
01:55:48,125 --> 01:55:49,666
<i>Reverend Roy Laferty,</i>

1467
01:55:50,166 --> 01:55:51,791
<i>Durham, North Carolina.</i>

1468
01:55:52,500 --> 01:55:55,916
<i>Though the poor fucker had been
completely worthless as a model,</i>

1469
01:55:56,458 --> 01:55:58,750
<i>Carl was insistent on keeping a record</i>

1470
01:55:58,958 --> 01:56:02,208
<i>of both his successes and his failures.</i>

1471
01:56:42,208 --> 01:56:43,208
Howdy.

1472
01:56:44,541 --> 01:56:46,000
You look like you've been traveling.

1473
01:56:49,333 --> 01:56:50,916
- Yeah.
- Where you headed?

1474
01:56:53,750 --> 01:56:56,750
There used to be a house and a barn
up on the hill over there.

1475
01:56:56,833 --> 01:56:58,791
Some lawyer owned it. You know it?

1476
01:56:58,875 --> 01:56:59,875
Sure I do.

1477
01:57:00,666 --> 01:57:02,083
Up in the Mitchell Flats.

1478
01:57:03,708 --> 01:57:04,666
Still there?

1479
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:08,291
Well, I'll be damned.

1480
01:57:09,458 --> 01:57:11,041
You're that Russell boy, ain't you?

1481
01:57:14,583 --> 01:57:18,250
I just thought, seeing as I was this way,
I'd stop by and see the old place again.

1482
01:57:21,208 --> 01:57:25,250
Son, I hate to tell you this,
but that place burned some years ago.

1483
01:57:25,333 --> 01:57:27,000
They think some kids did it.

1484
01:57:27,500 --> 01:57:30,416
Wasn't nobody ever living there
since you and your folks.

1485
01:57:30,958 --> 01:57:34,000
Well, heck, I come all this way,
I may as well walk up there anyways.

1486
01:57:34,083 --> 01:57:37,833
Sure, just cut across Clarence's pasture.

1487
01:57:37,916 --> 01:57:39,166
He won't say nothing.

1488
01:57:47,916 --> 01:57:50,541
I never did thank you
for the night my dad died.

1489
01:57:52,333 --> 01:57:53,666
You were awful kind of me,

1490
01:57:53,750 --> 01:57:56,333
and I just want you to know
that I ain't never forgot it.

1491
01:57:57,166 --> 01:58:00,250
You had that pie smeared
all across your face.

1492
01:58:00,791 --> 01:58:04,208
Damn Bodecker thought it was blood.
Remember that?

1493
01:58:04,875 --> 01:58:07,083
Yeah, I remember everything
about that night.

1494
01:58:08,666 --> 01:58:10,500
He ain't the lawman that I expected.

1495
01:58:11,333 --> 01:58:12,833
Shame about his sister though.

1496
01:58:13,500 --> 01:58:14,791
Why? What happened?

1497
01:58:14,875 --> 01:58:17,291
Well, his sister and her husband
were found dead.

1498
01:58:17,833 --> 01:58:19,458
Not far from Meade.

1499
01:58:24,416 --> 01:58:25,375
You come back to see me.

1500
01:58:26,666 --> 01:58:28,125
We'll sit out and drink some beer.

1501
01:58:29,041 --> 01:58:30,125
I'll do that.

1502
01:58:31,375 --> 01:58:32,458
Lee.

1503
01:58:32,541 --> 01:58:36,166
Got a call from Sheriff Thompson
in Lewisburg, West Virginia.

1504
01:58:36,250 --> 01:58:38,041
Wants you to call him back
as soon as possible.

1505
01:58:38,125 --> 01:58:41,000
<i>I had a man shot down here two days back.</i>

1506
01:58:41,083 --> 01:58:42,583
<i>He was a preacher.</i>

1507
01:58:42,666 --> 01:58:45,708
<i>And we're suspecting it's a boy
that used to live up around your parts.</i>

1508
01:58:45,791 --> 01:58:46,833
That right?

1509
01:58:47,333 --> 01:58:48,583
How'd he kill the man?

1510
01:58:48,666 --> 01:58:50,416
<i>A couple shots.</i>

1511
01:58:50,500 --> 01:58:53,916
<i>Pistol. Probably a Luger
that the boy's known to have.</i>

1512
01:58:55,291 --> 01:58:57,625
- That's a nine millimeter, ain't it?
<i>- That's right.</i>

1513
01:58:59,750 --> 01:59:01,333
What'd you say the boy's name was?

1514
01:59:01,416 --> 01:59:04,000
<i>I didn't say, but it's Arvin Russell.</i>

1515
01:59:04,083 --> 01:59:07,000
<i>Both of his parents died up around there,
as I understand it.</i>

1516
01:59:07,083 --> 01:59:09,875
<i>Father was a suicide,
and he's been living down here</i>

1517
01:59:09,958 --> 01:59:11,625
<i>with the grandmother and the uncle.</i>

1518
01:59:12,125 --> 01:59:14,666
<i>Listen, I don't think the boy's dangerous.</i>

1519
01:59:15,541 --> 01:59:19,000
<i>From what I'm hearing,
this preacher might've deserved killing.</i>

1520
01:59:19,083 --> 01:59:19,916
Is this boy driving?

1521
01:59:20,916 --> 01:59:21,791
<i>Could be.</i>

1522
01:59:21,875 --> 01:59:25,500
<i>He owns an ol' busted up Chevy 3100, '54.</i>

1523
01:59:25,583 --> 01:59:28,000
<i>I don't know
that it'd make it all the way up there.</i>

1524
01:59:28,083 --> 01:59:30,291
<i>At this point, he might be hitchhiking.</i>

1525
01:59:30,375 --> 01:59:33,000
<i>Dark hair, not bad looking. Quiet.</i>

1526
01:59:38,708 --> 01:59:40,250
Who's gonna bury Jack?

1527
01:59:45,916 --> 01:59:46,750
I don't know.

1528
01:59:48,416 --> 01:59:50,791
I don't know
who's gonna wanna touch that thing.

1529
01:59:56,333 --> 01:59:58,750
Look, kid...

1530
02:00:00,083 --> 02:00:03,208
my daddy didn't do anything
like what your daddy did up there,

1531
02:00:03,291 --> 02:00:05,958
but he did up and leave me,
my mama, and my sister.

1532
02:00:07,958 --> 02:00:11,375
He just went off to the shoe factory
one morning and never came back.

1533
02:00:12,166 --> 02:00:14,916
And there was nothing to do
but forget his sorry ass.

1534
02:00:18,125 --> 02:00:21,041
Some people were born
just so they could be buried.

1535
02:02:18,541 --> 02:02:22,208
<i>Arvin thought about the days</i>
<i>leading up to his mother's death,</i>

1536
02:02:22,291 --> 02:02:25,083
<i>how Willard wanted so much
for her to live.</i>

1537
02:02:25,750 --> 02:02:28,000
<i>His father
would have done anything to save her.</i>

1538
02:02:28,625 --> 02:02:32,291
<i>Fuck the blood and stink,
the heat and the insects.</i>

1539
02:02:32,833 --> 02:02:33,791
Anything.

1540
02:02:34,291 --> 02:02:36,250
<i>Arvin said to himself.</i>

1541
02:02:38,083 --> 02:02:42,083
<i>And suddenly he realized,
standing in his father's church,</i>

1542
02:02:42,583 --> 02:02:44,541
<i>that he'd had no other choice,</i>

1543
02:02:45,458 --> 02:02:48,791
<i>that Willard had needed to go
wherever Charlotte went.</i>

1544
02:03:28,833 --> 02:03:30,291
Arvin Russell!

1545
02:03:32,125 --> 02:03:33,666
I know you're down there somewhere!

1546
02:03:35,208 --> 02:03:37,125
It's Sheriff Bodecker, son!

1547
02:03:38,875 --> 02:03:40,416
Got some questions to ask you!

1548
02:03:50,875 --> 02:03:52,166
Sorry about that!

1549
02:03:54,416 --> 02:03:56,208
Goddamn bird scared me.

1550
02:04:00,625 --> 02:04:02,083
I ain't here to hurt you!

1551
02:04:05,458 --> 02:04:08,000
And I know that you don't wanna hurt me!

1552
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,166
Come on out so we can have us a talk!

1553
02:04:18,083 --> 02:04:19,875
Okay.

1554
02:04:35,750 --> 02:04:38,083
I figured this might be where you'd come.

1555
02:04:39,875 --> 02:04:42,000
Remember that night
you brought me up here?

1556
02:04:43,416 --> 02:04:45,500
That was an awful thing your daddy did.

1557
02:04:50,083 --> 02:04:53,458
God dammit, boy, don't...
Don't fuck with me!

1558
02:05:03,708 --> 02:05:06,375
Put the gun down, Sheriff!
I got one pointed right at you!

1559
02:05:11,958 --> 02:05:13,083
Can't do that, son!

1560
02:05:14,708 --> 02:05:17,250
Just set it on the ground and step away!

1561
02:05:20,458 --> 02:05:21,416
What?

1562
02:05:21,500 --> 02:05:23,791
Just set it on the ground and step away!

1563
02:05:25,500 --> 02:05:29,625
So you can kill me like you did my sister
and that preacher down in West Virginia?!

1564
02:05:33,125 --> 02:05:35,208
I'm not a bad person, Sheriff.

1565
02:05:36,208 --> 02:05:38,041
That preacher weren't no good!

1566
02:05:39,541 --> 02:05:42,958
He hurt my sister so bad
she killed herself, Sheriff!

1567
02:05:43,041 --> 02:05:44,083
I had no choice!

1568
02:05:54,541 --> 02:05:57,708
I hate to be the one to tell you this,
Sheriff, but your sister...

1569
02:05:58,291 --> 02:06:00,291
and her husband,
they weren't no good neither!

1570
02:06:00,375 --> 02:06:03,833
I got a snapshot in my pocket here
of her hugging on some dead guy.

1571
02:06:03,916 --> 02:06:05,791
You let loose that gun
and I'll show it to you!

1572
02:06:55,083 --> 02:06:56,583
I had no choice.

1573
02:06:59,666 --> 02:07:01,708
They were gonna kill me, I swear.

1574
02:07:04,833 --> 02:07:06,708
I begged her to put the gun down.

1575
02:07:15,375 --> 02:07:16,416
I'm sorry.

1576
02:07:18,458 --> 02:07:21,291
<i>Though it seemed to Arvin</i>
<i>as if hours went by</i>

1577
02:07:21,375 --> 02:07:24,000
<i>while he listened
to the Sheriff fight to stay alive,</i>

1578
02:07:24,625 --> 02:07:27,916
<i>it actually took the man
only a few minutes to die.</i>

1579
02:08:45,041 --> 02:08:46,250
Thank you, mister.

1580
02:08:47,125 --> 02:08:49,000
I didn't think
anybody was gonna pick me up.

1581
02:08:49,875 --> 02:08:51,083
Looks like you had a rough day.

1582
02:08:52,708 --> 02:08:53,541
Yeah.

1583
02:08:53,625 --> 02:08:55,333
Uh, where you headed?

1584
02:08:55,416 --> 02:08:57,666
I ain't figured that out yet.
Where you headed?

1585
02:08:57,750 --> 02:08:58,958
Cincinnati.

1586
02:08:59,041 --> 02:09:00,875
- All right.
- That okay for you?

1587
02:09:01,375 --> 02:09:02,375
Uh...

1588
02:09:03,666 --> 02:09:05,791
Yeah, I've been meaning
to get up that way.

1589
02:09:06,708 --> 02:09:08,750
... <i>to make known</i>
<i>his final decision</i>

1590
02:09:08,833 --> 02:09:10,250
<i>to significantly increase</i>

1591
02:09:10,333 --> 02:09:13,500
<i>the number of US troops
deployed to south Vietnam.</i>

1592
02:09:13,583 --> 02:09:17,083
<i>He explained the reason for his actions
in these historic words.</i>

1593
02:09:17,166 --> 02:09:20,375
<i>We intend to convince the communists</i>

1594
02:09:21,125 --> 02:09:23,166
<i>that we cannot be defeated</i>

1595
02:09:23,666 --> 02:09:25,416
<i>by force of arms</i>

1596
02:09:26,208 --> 02:09:28,458
<i>or by superior power.</i>

1597
02:09:29,916 --> 02:09:31,791
<i>They're not easily convinced.</i>

1598
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:36,541
<i>Arvin didn't want</i>
<i>to fall asleep sitting next to a stranger,</i>

1599
02:09:37,208 --> 02:09:39,458
<i>and as he fought hard to stay awake,</i>

1600
02:09:39,541 --> 02:09:41,791
<i>his mind began taking him places.</i>

1601
02:09:44,958 --> 02:09:48,416
<i>He started to think maybe the law
would recognize he had done good.</i>

1602
02:09:51,375 --> 02:09:53,000
<i>Maybe he'd be forgiven.</i>

1603
02:09:53,708 --> 02:09:57,375
<i>Maybe he'd even be able to see Grandma
and Uncle Earskell again.</i>

1604
02:09:58,750 --> 02:10:00,625
<i>Or maybe that was too risky.</i>

1605
02:10:03,458 --> 02:10:04,291
What happened?

1606
02:10:06,833 --> 02:10:08,375
<i>But still...</i>

1607
02:10:08,458 --> 02:10:12,083
<i>maybe he'd meet a girl,
start a family like his daddy did.</i>

1608
02:10:17,750 --> 02:10:22,625
<i>As the thoughts came, he wasn't sure
if he was going backwards or forwards.</i>

1609
02:10:23,791 --> 02:10:25,583
<i>He knew wherever this was,</i>

1610
02:10:26,083 --> 02:10:28,291
<i>it felt nicer than Knockemstiff.</i>

1611
02:10:28,958 --> 02:10:31,541
<i>No fighting or screaming or pain.</i>

1612
02:10:33,166 --> 02:10:36,125
<i>Then the thought of enlisting
got into his brain.</i>

1613
02:10:37,416 --> 02:10:41,041
<i>And he wasn't sure if he was thinking
about himself or Willard anymore.</i>

1614
02:10:43,750 --> 02:10:46,666
<i>He didn't want
to end up in a war like his father.</i>

1615
02:10:47,208 --> 02:10:49,750
<i>But he was good at fighting.</i>

1616
02:10:50,041 --> 02:10:51,875
<i>Maybe that's where he belonged.</i>

1617
02:10:53,750 --> 02:10:57,375
<i>Grandma would tell him to pray on it,
and he'd laugh at her.</i>

1618
02:10:57,916 --> 02:11:00,291
<i>But maybe she knew something he didn't.</i>

1619
02:11:01,333 --> 02:11:04,125
<i>Right now, he needed sleep</i>

1620
02:11:04,541 --> 02:11:07,875
<i>and just felt lucky
someone was giving him a ride.</i>
