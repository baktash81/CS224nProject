1
00:00:08,592 --> 00:00:12,667
Operation Saint Peter

2
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:26,265
Here.

3
00:02:38,559 --> 00:02:41,651
We're right underneath the
agricultural bank of Naples.

4
00:02:41,741 --> 00:02:44,900
This is the job of our life.

5
00:02:45,578 --> 00:02:48,578
Let's proceed with the hole.

6
00:02:50,116 --> 00:02:52,609
The drill.

7
00:03:00,996 --> 00:03:03,811
Captain.
Captain, take it slowly.

8
00:03:03,911 --> 00:03:06,448
I'm wearing dark clothes.

9
00:03:09,999 --> 00:03:12,058
Baron.

10
00:03:19,568 --> 00:03:22,403
I don't see anything.

11
00:03:29,143 --> 00:03:31,659
Are you mute?

12
00:03:33,145 --> 00:03:37,052
The safety deposit boxes are north-east.
-Where's north-east?

13
00:03:37,152 --> 00:03:39,852
If you don't know, captain?

14
00:03:45,619 --> 00:03:50,726
I don't want to laugh but the bank
of Naples seems a bit run-down.

15
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:57,982
What are you playing at?
There are people sleeping in here.

16
00:03:58,186 --> 00:04:00,063
A guard.
-What guard?

17
00:04:00,063 --> 00:04:02,209
He's got the face of a thief.

18
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:04,611
Silence.

19
00:04:06,043 --> 00:04:08,787
What is it?
-We're in a prison cell.

20
00:04:08,787 --> 00:04:12,144
You got it all wrong.
They'll call the police.

21
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:14,976
You'll pay for this.
I've seen you.

22
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:18,054
Us too, brigadier.
Sorry to disturb.

23
00:04:18,254 --> 00:04:22,153
Wait for me.
I'm coming as well.

24
00:04:23,153 --> 00:04:25,436
I'll get the keys.

25
00:04:33,427 --> 00:04:35,330
Is everyone here?

26
00:04:38,902 --> 00:04:41,424
Who's he?

27
00:04:42,863 --> 00:04:44,814
Napoleon.

28
00:04:47,108 --> 00:04:50,283
Be careful, that's my cloakroom.

29
00:04:53,956 --> 00:04:55,565
What are you smoking?

30
00:04:55,565 --> 00:04:58,687
What do you think?
Nationals.

31
00:04:58,687 --> 00:05:02,509
A disgrace.
You're all a disgrace.

32
00:05:05,578 --> 00:05:09,684
To make money you need money.
Do you have any change?

33
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:13,415
To be honest...
-Yes, or no?

34
00:05:16,978 --> 00:05:18,929
600 Lira.

35
00:05:19,998 --> 00:05:22,561
And you?

36
00:05:28,253 --> 00:05:31,525
That makes it 900.

37
00:05:32,847 --> 00:05:37,626
I'm nobility, I don't carry any.
-The strength of the hand is in the fingers...

38
00:05:37,626 --> 00:05:41,026
That's what we say in Palermo.
All for one.

39
00:05:41,026 --> 00:05:43,720
Hand it over.

40
00:05:47,315 --> 00:05:50,687
There you go.
-Give it here.

41
00:05:55,153 --> 00:05:58,115
Saint Luchino.
They call me the baron.

42
00:06:02,979 --> 00:06:05,410
What a mess.

43
00:06:06,158 --> 00:06:09,261
How can I help you, St Luchino,
if you don't help yourself?

44
00:06:09,261 --> 00:06:12,505
You need initiative.
Initiative...

45
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:15,773
Miserable scum.

46
00:06:23,785 --> 00:06:27,674
This is our pathetic
starting capital, 2500 lira...

47
00:06:27,774 --> 00:06:30,626
But, in Napoleon's hands,
it will become 5000 lira.

48
00:06:30,626 --> 00:06:33,112
What am I saying?
500,000.

49
00:06:33,112 --> 00:06:35,401
A million.

50
00:06:44,213 --> 00:06:47,280
Get lost.

51
00:06:54,426 --> 00:06:57,843
I told you, didn't I?
This place isn't up to my standards.

52
00:06:57,843 --> 00:07:01,768
We must go north, to Rome.
That's where Napoleon can flourish.

53
00:07:01,787 --> 00:07:06,597
How will we get there if we don't
even have enough money for a tram?

54
00:07:06,632 --> 00:07:10,599
I'll find a way.
Call me the minister of transport.

55
00:07:12,649 --> 00:07:15,440
How beautiful.

56
00:07:27,836 --> 00:07:29,756
'Italian stock exchange'

57
00:07:31,251 --> 00:07:36,005
Did you just drop one?
-In Catania they say it brings good luck.

58
00:07:36,005 --> 00:07:38,711
It doesn't look like it.

59
00:07:38,711 --> 00:07:41,838
Because we lost 250 Lira playing
briscola? (Italian card game)

60
00:07:41,838 --> 00:07:43,508
Thieves.

61
00:07:43,508 --> 00:07:47,395
This friend of yours in Rome,
is he really that well connected?

62
00:07:47,395 --> 00:07:49,276
Who?
Panzanera?

63
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,378
All the stolen goods in the
city pass through his hands.

64
00:07:56,951 --> 00:07:59,657
He would always say to me:
"Napoleon..."

65
00:07:59,657 --> 00:08:02,820
"Napoleon, leave your
father and come to Rome...

66
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:06,105
You'll find a brother and a house.

67
00:08:19,171 --> 00:08:21,616
Pick it up.
-Yes, sir.

68
00:08:32,675 --> 00:08:35,563
It looks abandoned.

69
00:08:53,427 --> 00:08:57,828
This Panzanera takes care of himself.
-Of course, I told you so.

70
00:09:25,374 --> 00:09:28,054
Where's Panzanera?

71
00:09:44,433 --> 00:09:47,070
Who are you looking for?
-Panzanera.

72
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:50,900
We're friends of the family.
-Panzanera isn't here, he's in prison.

73
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,056
We've got time.
We can wait.

74
00:09:55,056 --> 00:09:57,802
Three years, five months and ten days.

75
00:09:57,802 --> 00:10:01,329
You'll have to wait three
years, five months and ten days.

76
00:10:01,329 --> 00:10:04,096
They sentenced him yesterday.

77
00:10:05,758 --> 00:10:07,769
I told you, didn't I?

78
00:10:07,769 --> 00:10:11,094
You had to break me out sooner.

79
00:10:11,094 --> 00:10:13,836
Who are you?

80
00:10:13,836 --> 00:10:16,981
Who else?
I'm Cajella.

81
00:10:17,146 --> 00:10:19,462
Excuse me, doctor Cajella...

82
00:10:19,462 --> 00:10:24,014
The fact is, we only know Rome
as tourists, but professionally...

83
00:10:24,014 --> 00:10:26,160
We're a bit out of the loop.

84
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,669
What's your specialisation?
-We're quite eclectic...

85
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:32,731
From bag snatching to robbery.
-The usual jack of all trades.

86
00:10:32,731 --> 00:10:36,565
They want specialists nowadays.
A specialist...

87
00:10:36,565 --> 00:10:40,262
...always stays afloat.
Look at Cajella here.

88
00:10:40,262 --> 00:10:42,631
Cajella works with Americans...

89
00:10:42,631 --> 00:10:45,762
Widows and divorcees.

90
00:10:46,982 --> 00:10:49,426
It's a bit of a mix.

91
00:10:49,426 --> 00:10:52,778
What do you do to them?
-I'm coming.

92
00:10:54,351 --> 00:10:58,353
What does Cajella do?
A little slap and I'm off.

93
00:10:58,353 --> 00:11:01,074
Sometimes I make $10...

94
00:11:01,274 --> 00:11:02,917
$20...

95
00:11:02,917 --> 00:11:06,127
Sometimes I even make $50.

96
00:11:08,663 --> 00:11:13,498
In other words, he entertains himself
with American women of a certain age...

97
00:11:13,498 --> 00:11:15,860
With fraud in mind.

98
00:11:16,748 --> 00:11:19,906
He's a gigolo.
-Didn't you notice?

99
00:11:19,906 --> 00:11:22,270
Goodbye, folks.

100
00:11:24,028 --> 00:11:26,512
I'm coming.

101
00:11:38,124 --> 00:11:40,499
A youngster of dubious morals.

102
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:42,804
At least he eats.

103
00:11:42,804 --> 00:11:45,077
We'll eat as well.

104
00:11:46,996 --> 00:11:49,979
I'll show these cretins what
Napoleon is capable of...

105
00:11:49,979 --> 00:11:54,114
In Palermo they called me the
Al Capone of supermarkets.

106
00:11:54,114 --> 00:11:57,226
I always will be.
Just like a swordfish...

107
00:11:57,226 --> 00:11:59,409
I'm a predator...

108
00:11:59,409 --> 00:12:01,270
With no fear.

109
00:12:04,219 --> 00:12:05,675
I'll go in...

110
00:12:05,675 --> 00:12:09,133
I'll steal some lasagne.
Translation: wallet.

111
00:12:09,861 --> 00:12:11,873
...and I'll leave peacefully.

112
00:12:11,873 --> 00:12:16,335
Showing the world it is me.
No one can stop Napoleon...

113
00:12:17,595 --> 00:12:21,180
No one can stop him.

114
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:25,917
We got you this time.

115
00:12:25,917 --> 00:12:27,689
Let go of me.

116
00:12:30,281 --> 00:12:33,291
It was an unfortunate misunderstanding.
I'm a foreigner.

117
00:12:33,848 --> 00:12:36,060
I thought you treated
tourists better in Rome.

118
00:12:36,131 --> 00:12:39,304
Let's not make this a battle
between north and south...

119
00:12:39,304 --> 00:12:41,545
What difference does it make?

120
00:12:41,545 --> 00:12:44,451
Guard.
-What is it?

121
00:12:44,451 --> 00:12:46,853
I'll show you.
-I'm innocent.

122
00:12:46,853 --> 00:12:49,537
He pick pocketed this woman.
-What are you talking about?

123
00:12:49,537 --> 00:12:52,865
It's not true.
There's been a mistake.

124
00:12:52,865 --> 00:12:56,022
But I saw him with his hand in your bag.

125
00:12:56,022 --> 00:12:58,259
It's still in his pocket.

126
00:13:00,243 --> 00:13:02,823
There you go.

127
00:13:04,689 --> 00:13:08,184
Do you know what I'm going to do?
I'll admit it...

128
00:13:08,184 --> 00:13:10,329
He's my fiancé.

129
00:13:10,329 --> 00:13:14,688
He can pickpocket me all he wants.
-This guy doesn't look like her fiancé...

130
00:13:14,688 --> 00:13:17,104
He looks like a thief.

131
00:13:17,104 --> 00:13:20,372
My dear, let's go Filiberto.

132
00:13:20,372 --> 00:13:23,263
Leave these people alone.

133
00:13:23,263 --> 00:13:25,611
He's even called Filiberto.

134
00:13:25,611 --> 00:13:28,578
I want to express my gratitude...

135
00:13:28,578 --> 00:13:32,541
For your noble gesture.
-Don't mention it.

136
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:39,298
Would you have done it for anyone else?

137
00:13:39,993 --> 00:13:41,267
No.

138
00:13:41,267 --> 00:13:45,917
Not for just anyone.
-Listen, madam...

139
00:13:45,917 --> 00:13:49,500
I'm going to catch my bus.
-You're leaving already?

140
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,131
We can meet again.
-When? Straight away.

141
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:54,804
Do you have a telephone?
-To be honest...

142
00:13:54,804 --> 00:13:57,852
I've been cut off.
-An address?

143
00:13:57,852 --> 00:14:00,295
My villa is near here.
I'm called...

144
00:14:00,295 --> 00:14:02,128
Napoleon.

145
00:14:02,128 --> 00:14:04,986
Yes.
Filiberto.

146
00:14:04,986 --> 00:14:06,697
Fili... Who?

147
00:14:07,761 --> 00:14:09,881
I was forgetting...

148
00:14:13,476 --> 00:14:15,375
There, you see?

149
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:18,740
You are honest, after all.
Filiberto.

150
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:23,949
Here, keep it as a reminder.
-No, I...

151
00:14:31,054 --> 00:14:34,266
Goodbye, Filiberto.

152
00:14:44,692 --> 00:14:47,460
Let's get to work.

153
00:14:52,221 --> 00:14:55,250
Don't get so upset.
-You're all I need this evening, Cajella.

154
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:58,384
You're ruining my reputation.

155
00:15:01,894 --> 00:15:05,051
Is a card for 5000 enough?

156
00:15:10,849 --> 00:15:14,576
Any merchandise?

157
00:15:15,852 --> 00:15:18,764
She's Julius Caesar’s mother.

158
00:15:25,667 --> 00:15:28,470
Play my usual.

159
00:15:45,969 --> 00:15:48,840
What does she want?

160
00:16:13,808 --> 00:16:16,379
Get off.

161
00:16:28,518 --> 00:16:32,132
Don't you find it boring here?
Let's go to my hotel.

162
00:16:32,132 --> 00:16:35,670
Where?
-I said let's go to my hotel.

163
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:38,393
Sure, Cleopatra.

164
00:16:49,354 --> 00:16:51,817
Crikey.

165
00:16:59,287 --> 00:17:02,599
Cajella's going to suck you.

166
00:17:21,586 --> 00:17:23,660
What are you doing?

167
00:17:24,471 --> 00:17:26,792
Very good.

168
00:17:27,011 --> 00:17:29,954
Do you like all this?

169
00:17:30,108 --> 00:17:33,894
It excites me.
-That's fine with Cajella.

170
00:17:37,928 --> 00:17:42,448
Wait a moment.
I'm going next door, I'll be right back.

171
00:17:48,722 --> 00:17:51,930
If she grabs a whip,
Cajella's out of here.

172
00:17:55,534 --> 00:17:58,318
My God.

173
00:18:01,786 --> 00:18:03,541
Try it on.

174
00:18:08,595 --> 00:18:10,927
Try on this uniform...

175
00:18:10,927 --> 00:18:13,959
Come on, honey.

176
00:18:14,524 --> 00:18:18,875
You might like it but Cajella doesn't.
-Do it for me.

177
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:21,895
Be quick.

178
00:18:26,243 --> 00:18:28,582
Can you see him from here?
-Yes...

179
00:18:28,582 --> 00:18:31,736
Take a look, Mr Ventura.

180
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:34,605
I see him.

181
00:18:34,605 --> 00:18:38,505
Do you like him?
-What do you think, Mr Ventura?

182
00:18:38,674 --> 00:18:43,283
He's not perfect but he's more
Italian than the last one, he'll do.

183
00:18:43,518 --> 00:18:46,177
Go.

184
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:57,294
Adorable.

185
00:18:59,351 --> 00:19:03,360
Cajella dressed like this, it may not work.

186
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,451
Turn around.

187
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:16,507
You'll perform perfectly in this uniform.

188
00:19:16,098 --> 00:19:19,735
That may be so but I can
feel myself getting weaker.

189
00:19:19,735 --> 00:19:23,760
It's not right.
-Go next door and get undressed.

190
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,500
I told you to undress, honey.

191
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:31,355
Cajella's got a tiger under here.

192
00:19:31,355 --> 00:19:33,629
Well, what do you think?

193
00:19:33,629 --> 00:19:35,842
Perfect.
Right, Joe?

194
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:40,648
Are you sure you can persuade him?
-He's a fool, he'll do anything I say...

195
00:19:40,648 --> 00:19:44,084
We just have to explain it to him,
and I know how to do that.

196
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,741
Go on.
Hurry up.

197
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:50,671
This is a lot better, right?

198
00:19:50,671 --> 00:19:53,243
What are you doing half naked?
-Pardon?

199
00:19:53,243 --> 00:19:55,943
Get dressed, quickly.
-I thought you wanted to do it?

200
00:19:55,943 --> 00:20:01,027
I've got a terrible headache.
Come on, hurry up.

201
00:20:05,823 --> 00:20:08,032
Cajella says she's mad.

202
00:20:08,328 --> 00:20:10,203
Get a move on.

203
00:20:10,203 --> 00:20:13,249
When will I see you again?
-Go away.

204
00:20:13,249 --> 00:20:17,608
You're leaving poor Cajella like this?
-Here's my number, call me everyday.

205
00:20:17,723 --> 00:20:21,870
I'm not used to this.
I really like you.

206
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:24,713
I know, I know.

207
00:20:24,713 --> 00:20:27,933
I really like you as well.
-If you...

208
00:20:27,933 --> 00:20:31,872
...like a man in uniform,
I can meet you in the middle.

209
00:20:31,872 --> 00:20:34,332
How should I dress?
Like a fireman?

210
00:20:34,332 --> 00:20:38,193
Wear what you want.
-Beautiful American.

211
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:43,007
Bye.
-Bye.

212
00:20:43,007 --> 00:20:44,603
Easy.

213
00:20:44,603 --> 00:20:46,910
Cajella will surprise you.

214
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:50,025
Careful, Samantha.
He looks like someone who'll talk.

215
00:20:50,025 --> 00:20:51,900
I'll take care of him.

216
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:56,477
How are you getting on with Joe?
-He's a formidable guy...

217
00:20:56,477 --> 00:21:00,314
You were right.
This really is a lucky day...

218
00:21:00,314 --> 00:21:04,890
I got to know Joe Ventura.
It's like the 14th of July in French history.

219
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:08,337
The 14th of July?
-Right.

220
00:21:09,283 --> 00:21:11,830
What a memorable date.

221
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:16,017
That was the date I buried joe
under some stones on the beach.

222
00:21:16,017 --> 00:21:19,168
That worm thought he
could get rid of me.

223
00:21:19,168 --> 00:21:22,895
Thank you for your nice words.

224
00:21:23,662 --> 00:21:25,673
Go on with the plan.

225
00:21:25,673 --> 00:21:30,438
We must get them to open the safe.
Agreed, Joe?

226
00:21:30,438 --> 00:21:32,664
Agreed.
-This is my task.

227
00:21:32,664 --> 00:21:36,640
Exactly, it's your job.
Whatever diamonds they show you...

228
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,944
You keep saying you
want something better.

229
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:41,725
This will get them to open the safe.

230
00:21:41,725 --> 00:21:44,818
It's very simple.
Right, Joe?

231
00:21:44,818 --> 00:21:46,781
So...

232
00:21:46,781 --> 00:21:49,782
You'll call us with this.
-What is it?

233
00:21:49,782 --> 00:21:53,169
It looks like lipstick but
there's a transmitter inside...

234
00:21:53,169 --> 00:21:55,984
No one will hear it but
we'll know when to strike.

235
00:21:55,984 --> 00:21:58,661
Have you seen it, Joe?
-I've seen them before.

236
00:21:59,989 --> 00:22:03,581
We'll be outside the shop.
As soon as you whistle we'll come.

237
00:22:03,581 --> 00:22:07,751
This way the safe will still be open.
We'll only need a minute...

238
00:22:07,751 --> 00:22:10,327
...to remove all the expensive jewellery.

239
00:22:10,327 --> 00:22:14,067
What do you think, Joe?
-Go on Frenchie, let's hear the rest.

240
00:22:14,067 --> 00:22:16,827
This is the most delicate part...

241
00:22:16,827 --> 00:22:20,674
If your friend, who'll be disguised
as a guard, knows what to do...

242
00:22:20,674 --> 00:22:24,894
As soon as we leave,
he'll arrive and block the traffic.

243
00:22:24,894 --> 00:22:27,548
This will give me a
five minute advantage.

244
00:22:27,548 --> 00:22:30,730
For you.
-Sure, for someone like you...

245
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:34,033
Even a minute is enough.
-Right...

246
00:22:34,033 --> 00:22:37,902
Here, we'll find the clean cars.
You and Joe will take one...

247
00:22:37,902 --> 00:22:40,969
...and us two will take the other one.
We'll look like tourists going to Anzio.

248
00:22:40,969 --> 00:22:45,371
There's no risk until we get to the boat.
-It should work.

249
00:22:46,981 --> 00:22:50,128
Any objections, boss?
-The bloodbath?

250
00:22:50,919 --> 00:22:52,955
What?
A bloodbath?

251
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:54,977
I said bloodbath.

252
00:22:54,977 --> 00:22:58,196
Where shall we do it?
In the jewellers or when we're outside?

253
00:23:00,161 --> 00:23:04,676
Joe's only joking.
-Who do you think invented the bloodbath?

254
00:23:04,676 --> 00:23:10,385
Joe Ventura, and this is why I'll go
down in history with Lincoln in the USA.

255
00:23:11,061 --> 00:23:12,908
1938...

256
00:23:13,819 --> 00:23:16,676
Six dead and a million in diamonds.

257
00:23:17,004 --> 00:23:21,831
1939, Stern in Chicago.
Twenty two dead.

258
00:23:21,831 --> 00:23:24,867
We all remember, Joe.
But we're in Italy...

259
00:23:24,867 --> 00:23:27,673
Violence isn't needed.
This is the land of spaghetti.

260
00:23:27,673 --> 00:23:30,913
All we need are three machine guns.

261
00:23:47,093 --> 00:23:49,454
What is it, guys?

262
00:24:02,449 --> 00:24:05,661
Very good, Samantha.
It's been interesting.

263
00:24:05,661 --> 00:24:07,698
Wait.
Joe gets too excited sometimes.

264
00:24:07,698 --> 00:24:11,601
He sees things how he
saw them twenty years ago.

265
00:24:11,601 --> 00:24:13,943
Sure, we understand.
-He's good at his job.

266
00:24:14,343 --> 00:24:16,593
Wait.
-Good morning.

267
00:24:28,154 --> 00:24:30,297
If it's empty, it's not my fault.

268
00:24:30,297 --> 00:24:33,655
There's no money in Rome...

269
00:24:39,995 --> 00:24:44,005
5000 lira.
-5000.

270
00:24:47,902 --> 00:24:53,078
I told you, didn't I?
Technically, it was the perfect robbery.

271
00:24:54,063 --> 00:24:57,299
Goodbye, Giulianna.
-Bye, Cajella.

272
00:25:14,484 --> 00:25:17,290
You made a day of it.

273
00:25:17,965 --> 00:25:20,744
Sure, she's my wife.

274
00:25:21,483 --> 00:25:24,204
You look in good shape.
-For the small expenses.

275
00:25:24,205 --> 00:25:29,336
We'll spend this right away.
-If eating once is enough.

276
00:25:30,247 --> 00:25:32,196
What does that mean?

277
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:37,703
I'm saying you need at least 1000
lira of pizza to fill the stomach.

278
00:25:37,704 --> 00:25:42,466
Once you've taken care of your
stomachs, with the money that's left...

279
00:25:42,467 --> 00:25:46,548
You should find a friend who's
trustworthy to give you some advice...

280
00:25:46,549 --> 00:25:49,877
Someone who can show you the
best place to rob in Rome...

281
00:25:49,878 --> 00:25:52,585
How you want and when you want.

282
00:25:57,229 --> 00:26:00,604
This place, speaking professionally...

283
00:26:00,605 --> 00:26:03,702
Is it safe?
-Where Cajella says?

284
00:26:03,703 --> 00:26:06,418
All the tourists in Rome go there.

285
00:26:06,419 --> 00:26:09,140
That's a million people.

286
00:26:09,141 --> 00:26:12,156
Remember, this is holy week.

287
00:26:22,867 --> 00:26:25,765
In this place I'm telling you
about it's easy to rob people.

288
00:26:25,765 --> 00:26:28,051
Go there and you'll see.

289
00:26:35,591 --> 00:26:38,106
They come from all over the world.

290
00:26:38,106 --> 00:26:41,307
Men, women, Americans, Swedes...

291
00:26:41,307 --> 00:26:45,849
It's free to get into San Pietro.
There's room for all the thieves in the world.

292
00:26:46,293 --> 00:26:48,432
Do you understand?

293
00:26:48,432 --> 00:26:51,969
You can steal anything you want.
-They stole my wallet.

294
00:26:51,969 --> 00:26:55,051
Whoever stole it will be upset.

295
00:26:55,051 --> 00:26:57,975
It's not the contents.
It was a family heirloom.

296
00:26:57,975 --> 00:27:00,492
Let's split up.
Everyone find a target.

297
00:27:00,492 --> 00:27:03,732
I'll check out that group.

298
00:27:12,048 --> 00:27:14,221
Here, in front of you, is the most
celebrated statue in the world...

299
00:27:14,221 --> 00:27:18,058
'La Pieta'
Sculpted by Michelangelo in 1501.

300
00:27:18,058 --> 00:27:20,890
Observe it well.
It's the greatest sculpture ever made.

301
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:24,291
When it was displayed in New York
it was insured for thirty million.

302
00:27:24,291 --> 00:27:28,300
Unfortunately, like on every holy
holiday, the statue is covered up.

303
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:33,596
But you can find some great
postcards in the shop...

304
00:27:33,596 --> 00:27:36,173
All at a great price.

305
00:27:36,173 --> 00:27:38,729
This way, please.

306
00:27:39,213 --> 00:27:42,634
Now, I'll show you the Sistine
Chapel and Michelangelo's frescoes...

307
00:27:42,634 --> 00:27:44,463
You won't see anything
because it's covered as well...

308
00:27:44,463 --> 00:27:48,003
It took two thousand sheets
to cover it, imagine that?

309
00:27:56,578 --> 00:27:58,578
Would you like to see...

310
00:27:58,578 --> 00:28:01,169
...the forbidden statue?

311
00:28:33,041 --> 00:28:35,745
Enough... Finished.

312
00:28:57,641 --> 00:28:59,760
Fuck off.

313
00:29:09,502 --> 00:29:13,371
Napoleon, wait.
We might get a result.

314
00:29:18,001 --> 00:29:19,857
I've had an idea.

315
00:29:21,647 --> 00:29:24,684
What do you mean he's not there?
I've been calling all day.

316
00:29:24,684 --> 00:29:29,376
You must tell him to call me.
Please, it's something urgent.

317
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:33,623
Yes, he knows my number.

318
00:29:44,766 --> 00:29:49,255
You and your stupid bloodbath.
He won't even speak to me.

319
00:29:49,308 --> 00:29:53,639
She said he went to a reunion.
-These damned French...

320
00:29:54,532 --> 00:29:57,172
I'll show them who Joe Ventura is.
I'll go there and I'll...

321
00:29:57,172 --> 00:30:01,356
No, there'll be no bloodbath.
Besides, they'll rob it by themselves.

322
00:30:01,356 --> 00:30:06,101
How will we pay for the hotel now?
-I could always kill the manager...

323
00:30:06,589 --> 00:30:09,564
In 1932, in San Francisco, I...
-Yeah, '32...

324
00:30:09,564 --> 00:30:14,066
Who cares about 1932?
I wasn't even born then.

325
00:30:14,066 --> 00:30:17,427
I curse the day I met you.

326
00:30:17,427 --> 00:30:20,801
Don't be like that, poppet.
Listen to me...

327
00:30:20,801 --> 00:30:25,109
In a week's time, Cosa Nostra will
have their usual meeting in the Bahamas.

328
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:27,144
Everyone will be there.
Old Adonis...

329
00:30:27,144 --> 00:30:29,795
Adonis is dead.
-Better for him.

330
00:30:29,795 --> 00:30:32,030
They'll all be there...

331
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:35,395
All the big bosses discussing
how to divide the cake...

332
00:30:35,395 --> 00:30:37,986
You'll see.
When they're all reunited...

333
00:30:37,986 --> 00:30:41,492
Joe Ventura will be among them.
They know me well...

334
00:30:41,492 --> 00:30:44,676
I bet you a dollar Ceruccia has
a heart attack when he sees me.

335
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:49,483
He already had one, years ago.
-They must give me every last penny.

336
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:53,695
20 years working in their banks.
20 years in Las Vegas...

337
00:30:53,695 --> 00:30:56,580
Those were the days, poppet.

338
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:59,150
It rained money.
Millions of dollars.

339
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:03,082
And you're worried about
a pathetic hotel bill?

340
00:31:06,134 --> 00:31:09,878
Go next door and be good.
Come on.

341
00:31:24,404 --> 00:31:25,851
What is it?

342
00:31:25,851 --> 00:31:27,693
Don't you like it?

343
00:31:27,693 --> 00:31:30,863
You wanted to make love in uniform.

344
00:31:30,863 --> 00:31:34,459
I borrowed it from a
waiter friend of mine.

345
00:31:34,459 --> 00:31:36,860
Yes, yes.
Extraordinary.

346
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:40,024
Samantha...
Cajella can't keep his hands off.

347
00:31:40,024 --> 00:31:42,865
I'd do anything to make you happy.
I didn't sleep last night.

348
00:31:42,865 --> 00:31:45,656
Yes...

349
00:31:45,656 --> 00:31:47,810
The third floor.

350
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:51,330
How high do you think that is?

351
00:31:52,225 --> 00:31:55,069
Around twenty metres.
What's that got to do with anything?

352
00:31:55,069 --> 00:31:57,574
Is there something else?

353
00:31:59,186 --> 00:32:03,383
Have you got a rope?
-A rope?

354
00:32:03,383 --> 00:32:07,364
You want me to tie you up.

355
00:32:14,309 --> 00:32:17,079
What are you?
A vaccum cleaner?

356
00:32:18,243 --> 00:32:20,185
You must leave.
I'm expecting company...

357
00:32:20,185 --> 00:32:23,703
Come back tomorrow and bring
a rope twenty metres long.

358
00:32:23,703 --> 00:32:27,380
Make sure it's at least
twenty metres long.

359
00:32:33,722 --> 00:32:37,071
A uniform, a rope, a whip...

360
00:32:38,396 --> 00:32:41,549
She's crazy, don't you think?

361
00:32:47,595 --> 00:32:50,329
What are they looking at?

362
00:33:20,223 --> 00:33:23,460
What have you found out?
-There are no guards...

363
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,701
Day or night.

364
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:28,614
That's impossible.

365
00:33:30,234 --> 00:33:34,386
Is the alarm system complicated?
-There are no alarms.

366
00:33:34,386 --> 00:33:39,417
Are you messing me around?
-It's true, we looked everywhere.

367
00:33:39,417 --> 00:33:42,312
There's nothing there.
-Thirty million...

368
00:33:42,312 --> 00:33:45,442
And you think they'd leave
it unguarded like that.

369
00:33:45,442 --> 00:33:47,857
What do you want?
We're in Italy...

370
00:33:47,857 --> 00:33:50,421
The land of disorganisation.

371
00:33:50,421 --> 00:33:52,955
I don't buy it.
They must be using infra-red.

372
00:33:53,449 --> 00:33:55,891
I'll go.

373
00:34:11,483 --> 00:34:14,756
There you go.
It's the end of mass.

374
00:34:21,331 --> 00:34:24,023
There's no infra-red.
-I told you so.

375
00:34:24,023 --> 00:34:26,639
Okay, then we can't do this job.
-Why?

376
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:30,139
No guards, no alarms, no traps.
What kind of job is this?

377
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:32,677
Fool.
-I give you my word.

378
00:34:32,677 --> 00:34:35,304
Do you take me for an idiot?

379
00:35:08,572 --> 00:35:12,218
I'm finished for today.
-Us as well.

380
00:35:38,165 --> 00:35:41,713
What are you doing, Napoleon?
Have you gone mad?

381
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,835
Indicate.

382
00:37:34,295 --> 00:37:36,742
My heart's going to explode.

383
00:37:37,061 --> 00:37:39,098
Are you taking it back to New York?

384
00:37:39,098 --> 00:37:41,811
No, it's going to Fatica.

385
00:37:42,581 --> 00:37:46,492
Napoleon, I've got a condition.
My heart can't take it anymore.

386
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,803
Napoleon, they've caught us.

387
00:38:05,596 --> 00:38:08,980
Stay on the right.
You're blocking traffic.

388
00:38:27,512 --> 00:38:30,287
It's shrunk.

389
00:38:44,299 --> 00:38:48,531
I told you... Thirty million.
I've done my part.

390
00:38:48,661 --> 00:38:52,586
It's down to you guys to sell it.

391
00:38:52,687 --> 00:38:56,674
Burini, have you got a rope?

392
00:39:09,407 --> 00:39:13,373
Nice sculpture.
-Ignoramus, it's Michelango's La Pieta...

393
00:39:13,373 --> 00:39:17,169
The famous American statue.
I stole it from St Peter's this morning.

394
00:39:17,169 --> 00:39:20,331
What do I know?

395
00:39:22,332 --> 00:39:24,382
Let's go.

396
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:30,129
If it's American gear, Cajella's
got some American contacts.

397
00:39:31,684 --> 00:39:35,193
Youngster.
This isn't some $50 knock-off...

398
00:39:35,193 --> 00:39:38,476
That's worth thirty million.
-God damn.

399
00:39:40,231 --> 00:39:43,049
Want me to ask around?

400
00:39:44,124 --> 00:39:45,989
I'll let you know.

401
00:39:45,989 --> 00:39:48,894
What did you want?
Do you need something?

402
00:39:48,894 --> 00:39:51,249
A rope.
I'll find one.

403
00:39:51,249 --> 00:39:54,656
Let me know if you
want to sell the statue.

404
00:39:57,825 --> 00:40:01,170
Get to work.
-So suddenly?

405
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:06,739
I reckon we'll get around
ten to twelve million for it.

406
00:40:06,739 --> 00:40:10,192
No...
At least twenty million.

407
00:40:10,192 --> 00:40:13,570
There's four of us.
Plus all the expenses...

408
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:17,586
...and accumulated interest.
We'll make three to four million each.

409
00:40:17,586 --> 00:40:20,216
What will we do with that?

410
00:40:47,455 --> 00:40:51,719
Someone's stolen Michelangelo's
'La Pieta' from St Peter's.

411
00:41:20,057 --> 00:41:21,935
Heavenly father...

412
00:41:22,536 --> 00:41:24,688
It's absurd.

413
00:41:26,432 --> 00:41:28,231
Can I help you?

414
00:41:30,949 --> 00:41:32,964
Can I help you?

415
00:41:34,944 --> 00:41:36,480
Tell me.

416
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:41,003
We'd like to interest you
in some important business.

417
00:41:41,004 --> 00:41:44,089
Business?
-Michelangelo's 'La Pieta'

418
00:41:44,089 --> 00:41:47,202
Michelangelo's 'La Pieta'...

419
00:41:47,202 --> 00:41:49,571
We can do something...

420
00:41:49,571 --> 00:41:53,933
Just bring me his sculpture of
Moses, we'll make it a pair!

421
00:41:53,933 --> 00:41:55,573
Federico.
-Yes?

422
00:41:56,469 --> 00:41:59,963
Get out of here you swindlers.
-Don't push.

423
00:42:13,054 --> 00:42:16,190
What a horrible way to eat.

424
00:42:31,873 --> 00:42:35,853
The police or Interpol?
-No, neither...

425
00:42:35,853 --> 00:42:38,686
We must find it ourselves.

426
00:42:38,686 --> 00:42:42,403
The essential part is secrecy.
No one must find out.

427
00:42:42,403 --> 00:42:47,418
Remember how they worried when
'La Pieta' was sent to New York?

428
00:42:47,418 --> 00:42:51,372
Just think what they'll say when
they find out it was stolen from us.

429
00:42:51,373 --> 00:42:55,520
In three days it will be Easter.
The statues must be unveiled...

430
00:42:55,521 --> 00:42:59,883
If it isn't there...
-Father McGregor, you lack faith.

431
00:43:00,557 --> 00:43:03,796
In two days, the statue will be in its place...

432
00:43:03,797 --> 00:43:07,104
Or I won't be in mine anymore.

433
00:43:13,923 --> 00:43:16,393
It's him.

434
00:43:25,845 --> 00:43:28,378
Lady...
-Call me Marisa.

435
00:43:28,379 --> 00:43:31,956
I've got nothing against this sacred place...
-We've almost arrived.

436
00:43:32,257 --> 00:43:35,007
Are you ready?

437
00:43:36,948 --> 00:43:39,289
Lady... Please.

438
00:43:39,290 --> 00:43:41,340
What do you want to do?

439
00:43:41,341 --> 00:43:44,100
What are we going to do?

440
00:43:45,116 --> 00:43:48,143
I wouldn't want to...
-Look.

441
00:43:53,279 --> 00:43:55,873
No, no.
It can't be.

442
00:43:55,873 --> 00:43:57,898
I'm sorry, it's impossible.

443
00:43:57,898 --> 00:43:59,853
Did you see?

444
00:43:59,853 --> 00:44:02,922
I saw Saint Agatha, Saint Rosalia,
Saint Prisoner...

445
00:44:02,922 --> 00:44:04,137
...and you.

446
00:44:04,137 --> 00:44:07,653
As soon as I saw you I knew
my Filiberto had come back...

447
00:44:07,653 --> 00:44:11,060
As bad as you are.
But I loved him so much.

448
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:14,420
If you say so, but I'm alive.
-Yes, Filiberto...

449
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:16,866
Just tell me what you want.

450
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:19,129
The cross.

451
00:44:19,129 --> 00:44:22,271
...and my answer is yes.
Yes!

452
00:44:22,271 --> 00:44:25,269
To be honest...
Considering the location.

453
00:44:27,344 --> 00:44:29,583
Are you messing me around?
-Who, us?

454
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:33,104
I've sold twelve 'La Pieta's'.
-But this is the real one...

455
00:44:33,104 --> 00:44:36,557
Made with expertise.
-Yes? Expertise?

456
00:44:36,557 --> 00:44:40,965
Then I'll swap it for Sofia Loren.
Then we'll make it a fair exchange.

457
00:44:43,534 --> 00:44:48,190
There's a deal going down in Rome.
Do you want to earn $20,000?

458
00:44:48,966 --> 00:44:52,177
Don't fool around.
-I'm not joking...

459
00:44:52,177 --> 00:44:54,583
Michelangelo's 'La Pieta'.
It's worth twenty million.

460
00:44:54,583 --> 00:44:59,744
...They want to sell it for ten million.
-Just get the suitcases.

461
00:44:59,744 --> 00:45:04,083
I don't get it.
Why don't you call the porter?

462
00:45:04,083 --> 00:45:07,567
Because I also have to pay the bill.
-So what?

463
00:45:09,282 --> 00:45:13,314
I don't have a penny.
-What?

464
00:45:13,314 --> 00:45:17,585
Not even $10,000?
-I don't believe so.

465
00:45:18,648 --> 00:45:22,066
What a shame.
You could've resold it for thirty (million)

466
00:45:22,066 --> 00:45:24,940
You'd have made twenty million.
With a little bit for Cajella.

467
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:28,748
Let's think about the suitcases.

468
00:45:40,963 --> 00:45:43,938
Who's he?
Al Capone's father?

469
00:45:43,938 --> 00:45:46,599
Be good.

470
00:45:47,188 --> 00:45:50,790
Lucy Connor, 1928...

471
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:55,566
You know where she is now?
-Second pillar under the Brooklyn bridge.

472
00:45:55,566 --> 00:45:59,398
Exactly.
With a nice pair of concrete boots.

473
00:45:59,398 --> 00:46:03,175
Every time I go over the
bridge I say "Hi, Lucy."

474
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:06,679
Now, it's your turn.

475
00:46:06,679 --> 00:46:09,798
Actually, both of you.

476
00:46:14,350 --> 00:46:16,440
What is it, guys?

477
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:20,393
Come on, Joe.
Walk.

478
00:46:21,656 --> 00:46:23,382
This way.

479
00:46:23,382 --> 00:46:27,879
Tell me, when do I start shooting?
-You start shooting...

480
00:46:27,879 --> 00:46:30,955
...when you see an eskimo.

481
00:46:32,448 --> 00:46:36,033
An eskimo.
-Yes, an eskimo.

482
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:39,028
I'm there.

483
00:46:39,028 --> 00:46:42,710
I'll wait in the garage.

484
00:46:46,647 --> 00:46:48,867
What is it, guys?

485
00:46:48,867 --> 00:46:50,706
Come this way.

486
00:46:50,706 --> 00:46:53,461
Bye.

487
00:47:01,559 --> 00:47:04,760
What's this about an eskimo?
-Don't worry about it, honey.

488
00:47:04,795 --> 00:47:09,210
Cajella's worried.
Rome is full of bridges, if he was serious?

489
00:47:09,511 --> 00:47:13,827
Haven't you heard of Joe Ventura?
-Yes, sure.

490
00:47:14,934 --> 00:47:16,679
That's him?

491
00:47:16,679 --> 00:47:18,352
He was.

492
00:47:18,352 --> 00:47:23,361
Yes, he was after WW1, in Chicago.
From the 20's to the 30's, and later...

493
00:47:23,361 --> 00:47:28,588
Joe was terrible in those days.
Then, one day, someone came knocking...

494
00:47:31,046 --> 00:47:32,520
Boss...

495
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:35,776
They want you downstairs.

496
00:47:46,543 --> 00:47:50,580
What is it, guys?
-An interview, Joe.

497
00:48:46,057 --> 00:48:49,833
From that moment.
Whenever he hears three knocks...

498
00:48:49,833 --> 00:48:53,386
Terrible Joe Ventura turned into a child.

499
00:48:53,386 --> 00:48:55,352
Always repeating...

500
00:48:55,352 --> 00:48:58,020
What is it, guys?

501
00:49:02,743 --> 00:49:05,709
I want one as well.

502
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:14,909
Are they your suitcases?

503
00:49:15,501 --> 00:49:17,766
I'm too tired to take all of them.

504
00:49:17,766 --> 00:49:21,421
Just take my four.
-The others?

505
00:49:21,421 --> 00:49:24,578
Leave Joe's.

506
00:49:26,337 --> 00:49:29,423
We'll leave Joe as well.

507
00:49:35,833 --> 00:49:38,424
Come on, push.

508
00:49:38,614 --> 00:49:41,272
A little bit more.

509
00:49:43,057 --> 00:49:45,069
Sorry, doctor.

510
00:49:45,069 --> 00:49:47,808
Plug it in.

511
00:49:50,868 --> 00:49:53,438
What are you doing?
-I made a mistake.

512
00:49:53,438 --> 00:49:56,160
What's going on?

513
00:50:04,607 --> 00:50:06,880
Strange...

514
00:50:07,386 --> 00:50:10,436
My head doesn't hurt anymore.

515
00:50:17,382 --> 00:50:20,199
That idiot's back.

516
00:50:23,045 --> 00:50:25,567
Cut it out, Frankenstein.

517
00:50:32,830 --> 00:50:35,595
I'll take care of him.

518
00:50:37,936 --> 00:50:39,729
Stop doing that.

519
00:50:40,178 --> 00:50:42,797
I'm not retarded.

520
00:50:44,603 --> 00:50:46,733
Get up.
-I've got nothing to do with it.

521
00:50:46,733 --> 00:50:48,610
We'll settle up later.

522
00:50:48,610 --> 00:50:52,339
I want to know about the statue.
What were you saying about 'La Pieta'?

523
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:57,491
You can pay us in installments.
Four, eight, even up to twelve months.

524
00:50:57,492 --> 00:51:01,290
What do you want me to say?
Look at the stuff I've got...

525
00:51:01,291 --> 00:51:06,159
I wasn't expecting you lot from Naples.
I need to buy some more varnish.

526
00:51:24,057 --> 00:51:26,550
No, I'm not going in.

527
00:51:26,585 --> 00:51:29,554
Why?
-There's someone inside, listen.

528
00:51:29,554 --> 00:51:32,978
No, it's just the wind
hitting a window, come on.

529
00:51:32,978 --> 00:51:35,320
Don't worry.

530
00:51:42,521 --> 00:51:45,793
No, if there's no one here then I'm going.

531
00:51:49,388 --> 00:51:54,177
If your friends come I'll be embarrassed.
-They won't come, they're selling something.

532
00:51:54,177 --> 00:51:57,001
Relax.

533
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:05,532
You're so handsome...

534
00:52:05,532 --> 00:52:07,528
...Filiberto.

535
00:52:07,518 --> 00:52:10,577
Stop calling me Filiberto.
-But, Filiberto...

536
00:52:36,109 --> 00:52:38,276
The Madonna.
-What?

537
00:52:38,276 --> 00:52:40,337
Yes, the Madonna.

538
00:52:41,002 --> 00:52:44,670
With Jesus.
-Okay, Madonna with Jesus.

539
00:52:45,758 --> 00:52:47,044
No...

540
00:52:48,344 --> 00:52:50,173
Not here.

541
00:52:50,173 --> 00:52:52,899
It's not right.
-What are you saying?

542
00:52:52,899 --> 00:52:56,736
You're with your handsome Filiberto.
Don't you recognise me anymore?

543
00:52:56,736 --> 00:53:00,780
I'm Filiberto, yes.
Your Filiberto.

544
00:53:33,397 --> 00:53:35,325
Kneel down.

545
00:53:50,604 --> 00:53:52,914
Poor guy.

546
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:58,267
No, I wouldn't advise it.
I heard that in 1927, Joe...

547
00:53:58,267 --> 00:54:01,119
...chased a guy all the way to Singapore.

548
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:04,199
There's this really long bridge
in Singapore with 80 pylons.

549
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:07,852
There's room for everyone.
-You two, come with me.

550
00:54:12,902 --> 00:54:16,187
I know what you were up to.
You wanted to use my name...

551
00:54:16,187 --> 00:54:19,622
And I know why.
But for now, listen closely...

552
00:54:19,622 --> 00:54:22,857
Forget this job you're thinking about.
It's kid's stuff.

553
00:54:22,857 --> 00:54:25,919
I've got something big lined up...

554
00:54:25,919 --> 00:54:30,883
You can help me.
I need a truck and your boat...

555
00:54:30,883 --> 00:54:33,207
I'll give you 20%

556
00:54:33,207 --> 00:54:36,044
20% of what?
-Ten million.

557
00:54:36,044 --> 00:54:40,694
Joe Ventura is here from America.
He was very big in the 1930's...

558
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:43,549
But he's retired now.

559
00:54:43,549 --> 00:54:48,689
I think we're on the wrong path.
Whoever stole 'La Pieta' is either smart...

560
00:54:48,689 --> 00:54:53,163
...or a diabolical being.
-But it wasn't well protected.

561
00:54:53,163 --> 00:54:58,408
I'm not referring to their audacity.
But the person who can find a way...

562
00:54:58,408 --> 00:55:03,428
...to sell it.
There's only one 'La Pieta' in the world.

563
00:55:04,969 --> 00:55:07,355
I myself cannot imagine...

564
00:55:07,355 --> 00:55:09,694
...who would buy it?

565
00:55:09,694 --> 00:55:14,900
The Vatican will buy it back.
To prevent a scandal.

566
00:55:17,791 --> 00:55:21,089
On Easter Sunday they
have to unveil the statues...

567
00:55:21,089 --> 00:55:25,223
'La Pieta' must be back in St Peter's.
-He's right.

568
00:55:25,872 --> 00:55:29,952
Joe, the truck is ready.
-Excellent, where are the machine guns?

569
00:55:29,952 --> 00:55:33,729
You've got the address, I'll be off.
-Quiet, imbecile.

570
00:55:34,674 --> 00:55:37,555
You hit me.
-Good.

571
00:55:37,555 --> 00:55:44,021
We'll do this like London in 1925.
-1925, in London?

572
00:55:44,021 --> 00:55:47,223
When we stole the Rembrandt
from the British museum...

573
00:55:48,062 --> 00:55:52,865
The first thing to do is get the
statue outside Italian waters.

574
00:55:52,865 --> 00:55:56,452
Then, we'll negotiate with the priests.
Okay?

575
00:56:16,776 --> 00:56:19,152
There's no one here.

576
00:56:21,318 --> 00:56:22,751
Great...

577
00:56:23,350 --> 00:56:27,111
You stay with this idiot.

578
00:56:43,586 --> 00:56:46,233
Get out.

579
00:57:03,309 --> 00:57:05,564
I've just remembered,
I've got an appointment.

580
00:57:07,469 --> 00:57:11,357
You hit Cajella as well.
I thought you loved me.

581
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:16,036
How can we help you, gentlemen?

582
00:57:20,906 --> 00:57:23,052
Go on.

583
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:28,818
I'll go, but I haven't
confessed since I was baptised.

584
00:57:29,619 --> 00:57:31,910
Go.

585
00:57:32,507 --> 00:57:35,199
I'll go, then.

586
00:57:52,487 --> 00:57:56,279
What happened?
-He's speaking another language.

587
00:57:56,280 --> 00:58:00,387
Let's go home.
-There's another one down there.

588
00:58:09,580 --> 00:58:11,956
Please be seated.

589
00:58:11,957 --> 00:58:14,072
Thank God for that.

590
00:58:14,073 --> 00:58:17,876
Okay, son.
Tell me what you've done, confess.

591
00:58:17,877 --> 00:58:20,179
Father...
-Go on, tell me.

592
00:58:20,180 --> 00:58:24,150
I stole.
-Who doesn't steal these days?

593
00:58:24,151 --> 00:58:27,034
I stole from church.
-That's a little more serious...

594
00:58:27,035 --> 00:58:30,283
However, don't worry.
Admit your sins...

595
00:58:30,284 --> 00:58:34,099
No, I stole from the Vatican.
-The Vatican? This more serious...

596
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:36,747
But it's not so serious.
Say three hail Mary's.

597
00:58:36,748 --> 00:58:40,489
I stole a statue.
-Statues aren't worth anything nowadays...

598
00:58:40,490 --> 00:58:43,827
Did you steal anything else?
-I'll tell you this outside of confession...

599
00:58:43,828 --> 00:58:47,012
I stole 'La Pieta' from St Peter's.

600
00:59:23,167 --> 00:59:26,360
Are they dead?

601
00:59:32,196 --> 00:59:36,501
Napoleon, have you eaten?

602
00:59:42,825 --> 00:59:45,636
Please forgive me.

603
00:59:46,642 --> 00:59:47,863
But I don't see...

604
00:59:47,863 --> 00:59:50,063
...the statue.

605
00:59:50,063 --> 00:59:53,457
Your Excellency.
We sold it to the American.

606
00:59:53,457 --> 00:59:56,706
So, you gave it to him.
-Yes, but...

607
00:59:56,706 --> 01:00:00,981
...he paid us $50.
-$50...

608
01:00:00,981 --> 01:00:02,507
'La Pieta'

609
01:00:02,507 --> 01:00:06,057
I told you to hurry up.

610
01:00:09,759 --> 01:00:11,958
Where is that son of a...

611
01:00:12,276 --> 01:00:16,586
Forgive me, I meant to say nice woman.

612
01:00:16,586 --> 01:00:20,800
You see, your eminence.
I'm looking for Cajella, my husband...

613
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:22,946
Tell me, please.
Have you seen him?

614
01:00:22,946 --> 01:00:25,294
He got in the car with the American.

615
01:00:25,294 --> 01:00:28,724
And you?
-He left with them.

616
01:00:28,724 --> 01:00:31,032
Was she there as well?

617
01:00:32,077 --> 01:00:34,102
I knew it...

618
01:00:34,102 --> 01:00:37,343
I knew there was someone else.

619
01:00:37,343 --> 01:00:43,170
I knew it would end like this.
He's fallen in love with an American.

620
01:00:43,170 --> 01:00:47,860
Madam, we couldn't care
less about any of this.

621
01:00:52,132 --> 01:00:55,562
May I ask a question?
Can Cajella get out now?

622
01:00:55,562 --> 01:00:59,202
Be quiet, you.
-Are you taking turns to hit me?

623
01:01:06,033 --> 01:01:09,992
A blue Chevrolet and a Fiat 626 truck.

624
01:01:10,130 --> 01:01:15,077
Can you give me any more details?
-Your eminence, there was also a woman.

625
01:01:15,077 --> 01:01:17,700
I know.
Brunette and tough...

626
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:21,592
You already told me about her.
-No, I meant the other one.

627
01:01:21,592 --> 01:01:25,196
There was another one?
-Stuck on the front of the truck.

628
01:01:25,196 --> 01:01:27,754
Interesting.
Stuck, how?

629
01:01:27,754 --> 01:01:32,391
Like she had no shame.
-What did this woman look like?

630
01:01:32,391 --> 01:01:35,603
Made of paper, like a pin-up model.
You know how they are.

631
01:01:35,603 --> 01:01:39,376
No, to be honest I don't.
But I can imagine.

632
01:01:39,376 --> 01:01:42,103
Do you want to make a note, father Ruiz...

633
01:01:42,103 --> 01:01:46,209
There's a poster from a magazine
on the front of the truck.

634
01:01:46,209 --> 01:01:49,423
It's an image of a woman.
-What did you say?

635
01:01:50,251 --> 01:01:53,543
Naked?
-I didn't put it there, monsignor.

636
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:55,394
Praise the Lord.

637
01:01:55,394 --> 01:02:00,062
The Benedictine father's your eminence.
-You talk to them, you know what to say.

638
01:02:00,562 --> 01:02:04,828
Your eminence, this is the only
photo we could find of Ventura.

639
01:02:05,028 --> 01:02:07,981
It was taken a few years ago.

640
01:02:10,533 --> 01:02:14,094
But this is the robber's son, eminence.

641
01:02:19,485 --> 01:02:21,385
Excuse me, your eminence...

642
01:02:21,385 --> 01:02:24,539
Given that we're dealing with gangsters...

643
01:02:24,539 --> 01:02:28,286
Wouldn't it be better to
contact the honourable society?

644
01:02:28,286 --> 01:02:32,864
There are no honourable societies here.
-The Sicilian Cosa Nostra.

645
01:02:32,864 --> 01:02:35,641
Very well.
In the worst case scenario...

646
01:02:35,641 --> 01:02:38,189
We must call the police.
-No police...

647
01:02:38,189 --> 01:02:42,179
We have very good reasons
to not get them involved.

648
01:02:42,179 --> 01:02:45,307
We'll find the statue of 'La Pieta'
By ourselves...

649
01:02:45,307 --> 01:02:47,845
Naturally, with help from God.

650
01:02:47,845 --> 01:02:51,980
I didn't want to say it but the
police here really are a disaster...

651
01:02:51,980 --> 01:02:54,657
Motorbikes, Panthers...
-I know, sonny...

652
01:02:54,657 --> 01:02:58,149
...but we also have our own organisation.

653
01:04:42,377 --> 01:04:44,240
A truck...

654
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:45,640
Fiat...

655
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:48,010
Nude.

656
01:04:49,417 --> 01:04:52,360
Always praise the Lord.

657
01:04:52,573 --> 01:04:54,966
Quick, brothers.

658
01:04:58,573 --> 01:05:02,013
Get in.
Everyone get in.

659
01:05:03,583 --> 01:05:06,136
Hurry up.

660
01:05:07,124 --> 01:05:11,159
Start the engine, brother Celestine.

661
01:05:19,530 --> 01:05:22,774
Thank you, brother motor.

662
01:06:01,129 --> 01:06:03,028
What did they want?

663
01:06:03,028 --> 01:06:06,588
How do I know?
They said they were looking for...

664
01:06:06,588 --> 01:06:08,778
...a picture of a nude woman.
-Nude?

665
01:06:08,778 --> 01:06:11,099
Nude.

666
01:06:32,808 --> 01:06:34,255
Excuse me, father...

667
01:06:34,255 --> 01:06:38,526
Why do we need this truck if we
don't even know where we're going?

668
01:06:38,526 --> 01:06:41,534
Our orders are to obey, brother.

669
01:06:41,534 --> 01:06:45,055
Wherever we go, God will guide us.

670
01:06:53,934 --> 01:06:55,143
Excuse me...

671
01:06:55,143 --> 01:07:00,382
What a thief my Cajella is.
Speaking respectfully.

672
01:07:00,382 --> 01:07:03,494
Print it immediately.
-Yes, your eminence.

673
01:07:03,494 --> 01:07:05,344
Print a thousand copies.

674
01:07:05,344 --> 01:07:07,621
Yes, sir.

675
01:07:36,736 --> 01:07:39,154
'God Be Praised'
'Wanted'

676
01:08:30,308 --> 01:08:33,759
Yes, of course.
It may not be in Rome anymore...

677
01:08:33,759 --> 01:08:39,616
Who knows where they're taking it?
Wherever they hide, God can see them...

678
01:08:39,616 --> 01:08:42,152
...and perhaps us, as well.

679
01:08:42,152 --> 01:08:45,792
In Lazio alone there are over
three thousand parishes...

680
01:08:45,792 --> 01:08:49,263
...and in each parish, there's a good priest.

681
01:09:07,670 --> 01:09:09,586
Don Antonio...

682
01:09:09,586 --> 01:09:13,155
It's long distance.
It's urgent.

683
01:09:13,155 --> 01:09:15,451
Yes.
-Yes, what?

684
01:09:15,451 --> 01:09:18,956
I want to marry this meatball.
-So, Giuseppe...

685
01:09:18,956 --> 01:09:21,075
Don Antonio.

686
01:09:21,075 --> 01:09:24,203
I'm not in for anyone.
Not even the pope.

687
01:09:24,203 --> 01:09:27,251
It's the pope.

688
01:09:29,452 --> 01:09:33,452
Excuse me for a moment.
-He's doing a wedding, he said he's not in...

689
01:09:34,115 --> 01:09:36,395
Except for you, Excellency.

690
01:09:36,395 --> 01:09:38,266
Yes.

691
01:09:39,721 --> 01:09:41,606
'La Pieta'

692
01:09:43,372 --> 01:09:45,927
What's your name?
-Giuseppe Rotelli.

693
01:09:45,927 --> 01:09:50,094
Giuseppe Rotelli, do you take Amelia
Galoni to be your lawful wedded wife, yes?

694
01:09:50,094 --> 01:09:51,771
Whatever you say.

695
01:09:51,771 --> 01:09:56,862
Amelia Galoni, do you take Giuseppe Rotelli
to be your lawful wedded husband, yes?

696
01:09:57,041 --> 01:09:59,397
Whatever you say.

697
01:09:59,397 --> 01:10:02,224
I bless your marriage in the name of the
father the son and the holy ghost, amen.

698
01:10:02,224 --> 01:10:03,799
The water.

699
01:10:03,799 --> 01:10:09,080
I'll bless you in the name of the father, the
son and the holy ghost, then, it's finished.

700
01:10:10,771 --> 01:10:14,237
Don Antonio, where are you going?
We still have the rings.

701
01:10:17,893 --> 01:10:19,389
It's such a lovely wedding.

702
01:10:24,677 --> 01:10:26,566
Come back.

703
01:10:27,594 --> 01:10:30,079
He's gone mad.

704
01:11:02,255 --> 01:11:04,635
Where the hell are they going?

705
01:11:04,635 --> 01:11:07,524
You did well to bring it,
but where did you find it?

706
01:11:07,524 --> 01:11:10,205
Sadly, the temptations of the devil...

707
01:11:10,206 --> 01:11:13,913
...occupy the dreams of our disciples.

708
01:11:15,663 --> 01:11:18,219
Come forward.

709
01:11:18,219 --> 01:11:23,739
They were all seized.
-This time the devil has done us a service.

710
01:11:23,739 --> 01:11:28,486
Is this the woman on the truck?
-With respect to you, sir. Yes.

711
01:11:28,487 --> 01:11:32,098
Print three thousand copies.
I want them distributed everywhere.

712
01:11:33,226 --> 01:11:36,653
Everywhere? Your eminence.
-Wait, Siegfried.

713
01:11:36,654 --> 01:11:40,807
Don't deliver them to the monks.
Or the boy scouts.

714
01:12:15,066 --> 01:12:17,724
Why have you all got it in for me?

715
01:12:37,585 --> 01:12:40,474
Where's the guy who was riding it?
-Don't waste time, let's go.

716
01:12:40,474 --> 01:12:41,938
There he is...

717
01:12:41,938 --> 01:12:44,130
It was a priest.

718
01:12:48,561 --> 01:12:52,501
Praise be to Jesus Christ and my
congratulations to the reverend...

719
01:12:52,501 --> 01:12:59,548
Alert the surrounding parishes and converge
on the road from Monterosi to Vignanello.

720
01:12:59,548 --> 01:13:02,844
Go to the crossroads
high up in San Martino...

721
01:13:02,844 --> 01:13:04,915
...and check the area.

722
01:13:04,915 --> 01:13:08,627
They're more likely to
be heading towards Anzio.

723
01:13:28,169 --> 01:13:31,438
These Jesuits always want to be first.

724
01:13:31,438 --> 01:13:34,350
Let's get them.

725
01:14:11,311 --> 01:14:13,450
Yes...

726
01:14:13,750 --> 01:14:16,382
Yes, I understand.

727
01:14:16,382 --> 01:14:19,654
Praise the Lord.

728
01:14:36,878 --> 01:14:40,919
They abandoned the truck.
-What about 'La Pieta'?

729
01:14:42,390 --> 01:14:45,288
They've taken it with them.

730
01:14:46,039 --> 01:14:50,897
The only lead we had went as far
as seven kilometres past Vitilliano.

731
01:14:50,897 --> 01:14:54,334
Not more than fifteen minutes ago.

732
01:14:54,334 --> 01:14:57,554
That's all we know for sure.

733
01:14:57,554 --> 01:15:00,512
If you'll permit me, eminence.
-Tell me, Schulz.

734
01:15:00,912 --> 01:15:04,328
The electronic brain.

735
01:15:32,781 --> 01:15:34,262
It's right...

736
01:15:34,262 --> 01:15:38,342
It really is right.
-What does it advise us to do?

737
01:15:38,342 --> 01:15:41,079
What we should've done on principal...

738
01:15:41,079 --> 01:15:44,806
If we'd had more faith and less pride.

739
01:15:45,622 --> 01:15:47,826
Pray.

740
01:15:50,921 --> 01:15:54,762
Only God can stop them now.

741
01:16:58,866 --> 01:17:01,272
There they are.
That's Cajella.

742
01:17:01,272 --> 01:17:04,488
Get them, stop them.
They stole 'La Pieta'

743
01:17:04,488 --> 01:17:09,087
I saw them myself.
The one on the left is Cajella, get them.

744
01:17:09,087 --> 01:17:12,863
Are you sure?
-Yes, yes. I saw them in the car.

745
01:17:17,802 --> 01:17:20,752
Come on, move it.
-Okay, Joe.

746
01:17:22,687 --> 01:17:25,463
Follow me, soldiers.
Don't let them get away.

747
01:17:25,463 --> 01:17:27,519
Get them.

748
01:17:29,315 --> 01:17:32,340
Can I borrow your bike?

749
01:17:35,086 --> 01:17:38,238
Jesus stole my bike.

750
01:17:39,622 --> 01:17:42,873
Hurry up, St Giuseppe.
You're so slow.

751
01:17:43,302 --> 01:17:47,546
Mind your own business, Plato.
Look, I'm running.

752
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:07,840
Over there.

753
01:18:07,841 --> 01:18:12,211
We'll have to drive fast.
Remember, you asked to come.

754
01:18:12,211 --> 01:18:16,563
As long as we have a good driver.
-Don't worry, I'll drive.

755
01:18:16,563 --> 01:18:20,188
Eminence, I don't imagine
you've raced in the Millemiglia.

756
01:19:13,405 --> 01:19:17,405
Slow down, there's a roadblock.
-Hold on, hold on.

757
01:19:22,356 --> 01:19:25,779
The priests fly in Rome.

758
01:19:34,910 --> 01:19:39,359
We think they're heading for the sea.
Everyone converge in the Anzio area.

759
01:19:39,359 --> 01:19:41,266
Praise the Lord.

760
01:19:41,266 --> 01:19:44,122
Yes?
Where?

761
01:19:44,122 --> 01:19:45,905
The twisted tree?

762
01:19:45,905 --> 01:19:48,681
Do you know where the twisted tree is?

763
01:19:48,681 --> 01:19:52,016
We have a convent in that area. (seminary)

764
01:19:52,016 --> 01:19:53,297
Yes, yes.

765
01:19:53,297 --> 01:19:57,185
Good, very good.
Talk while you're working.

766
01:20:38,525 --> 01:20:41,348
Are you sure you've never
raced in the Millemiglia?

767
01:20:41,348 --> 01:20:45,260
No, not the Millemiglia.
But I won at Indianapolis once.

768
01:20:53,327 --> 01:20:57,908
Dove to penguins.
Surround the Anzio area...

769
01:20:57,908 --> 01:21:02,052
Everyone converge immediately
on the road to Litorania.

770
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:27,884
It's not wide enough.

771
01:22:01,855 --> 01:22:05,737
How nice, the river is
running to the left again.

772
01:22:32,091 --> 01:22:35,168
Cardinal, you'll get us killed.

773
01:22:52,458 --> 01:22:55,905
Cover it up.
Come on, hurry up.

774
01:23:01,351 --> 01:23:03,788
It might be the police.

775
01:23:03,788 --> 01:23:07,366
We didn't see them on the road,
why should they be up there?

776
01:23:12,109 --> 01:23:15,674
We'll get the exact position from the sky.

777
01:23:15,674 --> 01:23:18,765
Excuse me, but have you
got a radio in the sky?

778
01:23:18,765 --> 01:23:20,884
You're a man of little faith.

779
01:23:21,692 --> 01:23:23,981
Here we go.
-What's that?

780
01:23:23,981 --> 01:23:28,667
Gabriel calling cardinal Brown...

781
01:23:28,667 --> 01:23:31,140
Over.
-This is Brown, I hear you...

782
01:23:31,140 --> 01:23:34,892
Over and I pray.
I pray to God you see the thieves.

783
01:23:34,892 --> 01:23:40,084
I see them, head towards Calarosa.
It's three kilometres south of Anzio.

784
01:23:40,988 --> 01:23:44,420
They've already loaded 'La Pieta'
There's no time to lose, over.

785
01:23:44,855 --> 01:23:48,292
Who was that?
Was it really the arch-angel Gabriel?

786
01:23:48,292 --> 01:23:52,100
No, it was father Gabriel.
Our airplane pilot...

787
01:23:52,100 --> 01:23:55,511
He's great.
He flies like an angel.

788
01:24:03,407 --> 01:24:07,014
This car won't get through there.
It's too narrow.

789
01:24:07,014 --> 01:24:10,733
With God's help we can go anywhere.

790
01:24:24,853 --> 01:24:27,564
He's the son of a baron.

791
01:25:01,374 --> 01:25:05,449
Everyone converge on Calarosa,
it's three kilometres south of Anzio.

792
01:25:05,449 --> 01:25:08,607
Attention, please.
Dove calling penguins again...

793
01:25:08,607 --> 01:25:14,466
An appeal to all the penguins in Anzio:
By any means, converge on Calarosa.

794
01:25:24,118 --> 01:25:26,362
Get on.

795
01:25:41,197 --> 01:25:46,095
I'll come down and get one of you.
This way we'll save some time.

796
01:26:19,004 --> 01:26:21,396
I'll try again.

797
01:27:29,551 --> 01:27:33,334
We're in Anzio.
Let's get to Calarosa.

798
01:27:42,837 --> 01:27:46,623
They're far away, they're getting away.
-I told you, didn't I?

799
01:27:46,623 --> 01:27:49,606
We need Jesus Christ to walk on water.

800
01:27:49,606 --> 01:27:54,119
You're right, sonny.
All we can do is try to jump over it.

801
01:27:54,119 --> 01:27:56,470
Hold on.

802
01:28:04,690 --> 01:28:06,845
What a landing.

803
01:28:06,845 --> 01:28:09,757
Let's get out.

804
01:28:12,589 --> 01:28:15,997
Excuse me, I tore my trousers.

805
01:28:19,067 --> 01:28:22,786
Thank God, I wasn't sure we'd make it.

806
01:28:22,786 --> 01:28:25,630
Me neither.

807
01:28:27,867 --> 01:28:30,476
Everyone on the floor.

808
01:28:30,476 --> 01:28:33,412
Full speed ahead, captain.
-Right away.

809
01:28:33,412 --> 01:28:36,284
He's talking to another captain.

810
01:28:36,284 --> 01:28:38,643
Move them.

811
01:29:16,788 --> 01:29:19,536
What an army.

812
01:29:24,301 --> 01:29:25,724
Eminence...

813
01:29:25,724 --> 01:29:30,853
You're more organised than the mafia.
-We're two thousand years older, sonny.

814
01:29:34,165 --> 01:29:36,177
Get out of here.

815
01:29:36,177 --> 01:29:39,198
Hurry up and jump overboard.

816
01:29:39,887 --> 01:29:42,763
Listen, I've got nothing to do with...

817
01:29:49,012 --> 01:29:50,907
Joe.

818
01:29:51,385 --> 01:29:53,737
Eric.

819
01:29:57,359 --> 01:30:00,742
How many years has it been?

820
01:30:01,127 --> 01:30:07,373
This isn't the right path for you.
I told you you'd find the right way.

821
01:30:07,373 --> 01:30:11,950
The devil put quite a tail on me.
I keep getting these headaches.

822
01:30:19,925 --> 01:30:23,174
What is it, guys?

823
01:30:27,426 --> 01:30:29,597
Take care of him...

824
01:30:29,597 --> 01:30:33,806
No man is completely evil.

825
01:30:40,154 --> 01:30:43,213
Stay where you are.

826
01:30:46,675 --> 01:30:50,315
I've got a weapon more
powerful than a pistol...

827
01:30:50,315 --> 01:30:51,748
The strip.

828
01:30:51,748 --> 01:30:55,876
One move and I'll start undressing.

829
01:30:55,876 --> 01:30:59,012
Take a step, eminence.
Take a step.

830
01:31:14,556 --> 01:31:17,117
Not bad.

831
01:31:17,899 --> 01:31:23,571
My daughter, you have to surrender
in these circumstances as well.

832
01:31:38,195 --> 01:31:40,113
Samantha.

833
01:31:40,113 --> 01:31:42,525
Cajella.

834
01:31:45,523 --> 01:31:49,369
My love.
What have they done to you?

835
01:31:49,369 --> 01:31:54,264
I'll always be able to find you.
I want to take you to America.

836
01:31:54,264 --> 01:31:58,855
My love, I'm coming right away.
I'll never leave you...

837
01:31:58,855 --> 01:32:01,911
Don't worry.
I'll never leave you.

838
01:32:12,939 --> 01:32:16,960
These women always find a way.

839
01:32:17,499 --> 01:32:20,216
Samantha, I'm coming.

840
01:32:20,216 --> 01:32:22,303
Take me with you.

841
01:32:48,533 --> 01:32:51,652
We've arrived early, brothers.

842
01:32:55,532 --> 01:32:59,539
What regiment are you from?
I mean to say, which convent?

843
01:32:59,540 --> 01:33:02,979
We're from Rome, eminence.
-What are you doing here?

844
01:33:02,980 --> 01:33:06,245
Did you get lost?
-No, eminence, the opposite...

845
01:33:06,246 --> 01:33:09,401
They told us to go and we obeyed.

846
01:33:09,402 --> 01:33:12,004
Whoever obeys does not get lost.
-Right.

847
01:33:12,005 --> 01:33:15,982
Go back.
Go back to your peace.

848
01:33:19,422 --> 01:33:21,998
Hurry, brothers.

849
01:33:48,291 --> 01:33:54,248
