00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,400
One fine day

3
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,200
You'll look at me

4
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,200
And then you'll know
our love was meant to be

5
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,600
One fine day

6
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:16,000
You're gonna want me for your girl

7
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,000
The arms I long for

8
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,600
Will open wide

9
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,800
Then you'll be proud to have me
right by your side

10
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,600
One fine day

11
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:46,300
You're gonna want me for your girl

12
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:54,400
Ooh, now I know you're

13
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,900
The kind of a boy

14
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,800
Who only wants to run around

15
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,700
I'll keep waiting

16
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:13,300
And someday, darling

17
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,000
You'll come to me

18
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,900
When you wanna settle down

19
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,200
One fine day

20
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,800
We'll meet once more

21
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:36,200
And then you'll want the love
you threw away before

22
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,200
One fine day

23
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,900
You're gonna want me

24
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:48,100
And one fine day

25
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,500
You're gonna want me

26
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,300
And one fine day

27
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,700
You're gonna want me

28
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,500
For your girl

29
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,100
I heard that my son, Dave Jr...
You met Dave Jr, right?

30
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:21,800
This is great news.
I was notified Sunday that Dave Jr

31
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,700
will be tried as a juvenile for grand theft auto.

32
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,900
Congratulations.

33
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,600
911. 911.

34
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,800
Mommy.

35
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,400
Mom?

36
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,800
I'm really thirsty, Mommy.

37
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,900
OK.

38
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,500
OK. OK, sweetie.

39
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,100
- Good night.
- Wait. There's one more sip left.

40
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:33,100
- Half a sip. You don't need it. Good night.
- I do need it. I do need it, Mommy.

41
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:41,200
OK. Now good night for real, OK?

42
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,300
- Good night, Mom.
- Night-night.

43
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,500
I'm real excited about the field trip tomorrow.

44
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,800
- I love big boats.
- That's good.

45
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,700
- The Circle Line is big, right?
- Yeah.

46
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,100
Good.

47
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,300
Mom?

48
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,200
Sleepy time now.

49
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,200
Is Daddy coming
to my soccer game tomorrow?

50
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,300
He's gonna try, Sammy.

51
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:13,900
Honey, do you remember when
I explained to you that Daddy has

52
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,700
- a different schedule to other daddies?
- Yeah.

53
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:23,400
Well, musicians don't always know exactly
when they're gonna get a chance to play.

54
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:27,100
So... there's a chance
he might not come tomorrow.

55
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,500
But he's gonna try.

56
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,900
Yeah. He's gonna try.

57
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,500
I love you a million, billion, zillion.

58
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,800
Do you love him?

59
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,900
Huh, Mommy?

60
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:46,400
I will always love your daddy
because he gave me you.

61
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,600
Now go to sleep.

62
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,600
I can't sleep, Mom.

63
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,800
I had a bad dream.

64
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:10,500
In just two minutes you already
fell asleep and had a bad dream?

65
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,500
Sweetie...

66
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,800
I don't even think I knew her.
She's lyin'. I'd divorce her.

67
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,300
- Hi, Jack.
- Dad!

68
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,300
- Hi, Daddy!
- Hey! You maggot, you! Come here.

69
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,600
Watch your step.

70
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,400
- Maggie, be careful.
- It's all right. She does it all the time.

71
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,100
I can't believe your plumbing's not fixed yet.

72
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:06,300
- So what's up, Kristen?
- Me and Greg got married last Saturday.

73
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,400
- Oh, yeah. How's Greg?
- He's waiting in the car.

74
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:14,000
Waiting with an ulcer, hoping you'll say yes.
I need you to watch Maggie for me.

75
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,700
OK. I can do that till about six.
Would that help?

76
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,500
- Well...
- For the whole week, Daddy.

77
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,900
We were going on our honeymoon today.

78
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,800
But the nanny's gotta go watch her mother
have a benign tumor removed in Ohio.

79
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:33,600
Greg's parents are too old. Mine are too crazy.
Yours are dead. So that leaves you.

80
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:38,100
- Please, Jack, do this. Please!
- I would love to but I'm working on a story.

81
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,400
- You're always working on a story.
- Yeah. It's what I do.

82
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:46,500
The same old one about a good-time father
to whom responsibility is a dirty word.

83
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:53,000
Here's a hint. For an attempted manipulation,
like the one in progress, I'd have tried flattery.

84
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,100
Why am I always the grown-up?

85
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:59,700
Because at the start of the relationship, when
we chose sides, you chose grown-up first.

86
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,200
- This is how you want it.
- No. What I want

87
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:06,900
is just once for you to make a sacrifice
in your career for your daughter.

88
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:11,000
Come here, my little noodle.
My little creature.

89
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,900
Go pee. And wash your hands and face
and brush your teeth.

90
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:28,800
We're in a hurry cos we have to
take your friend Maggie to school.

91
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:34,900
- We can't be late because of your field trip.
- I hate Maggie. She thinks she's so funny.

92
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,600
- Maggie?
- Here's Maggie's doctor's number

93
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,600
and the number of a baby-sitter
who can help tomorrow.

94
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:45,700
She's got a walk-on part today.
One last thing. This is really important.

95
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:50,100
My neighbor was supposed to take Maggie
to school for me this morning.

96
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,700
She lives in my building... Jack. Jack?

97
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,300
- Apartment 501. This is her number.
- OK.

98
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,500
- Her name is Melanie Parker.
- Melanie Parker.

99
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,100
If you want her to take Maggie
to school for you...

100
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,600
If you want her to take Maggie to school,
bring Maggie to her house before eight.

101
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:10,600
If not, call Mel and let her know that
you don't need her to take Maggie. Jack? OK?

102
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,900
I'm gonna miss my plane.

103
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,300
- Maybe I should cancel my honeymoon.
- Don't cancel it.

104
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,700
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. Don't worry. Say hi to Greg.

105
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,000
- Bye, baby!
- Bye!

106
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,100
Bye, baby.

107
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,300
Bye, baby. Baby!

108
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,200
Come on, Mom.

109
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,100
OK. Press two, honey.

110
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,300
Where are they?

111
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:02,700
Want some more? Don't burn your hands.
We're havin' a Manhattan camp-out.

112
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,500
Why don't you just bang on the door?

113
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,400
We can't bang on the door of honeymooners.

114
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:19,700
- What time does your school start?
- I don't know.

115
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:25,800
It probably starts around nine. We're gonna
get there a few minutes early just to be safe.

116
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:28,800
- What street's your school on?
- I don't know.

117
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,900
We're in trouble.

118
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:37,400
- I'm gonna miss the boat trip, aren't I?
- It won't go on time. We'll make it. I promise.

119
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,400
Let's run, just in case.

120
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,300
What's it say?

121
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:07,300
"The whole school is on the Circle Line.
Sorry we missed you."

122
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,400
That's a big "uh-oh," right?

123
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,000
Mom?

124
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:15,200
You must be Kristen's ex-husband.

125
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,400
- Hi, Sammy.
- Hi, Maggie.

126
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,600
And you must be...

127
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,200
OK. Well, you're not Sheila,
the actress/baby-sitter,

128
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:28,000
or Maggie's pediatrician, Dr Feldman.

129
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:32,700
Oh, there you go. "Don't forget to call
Melanie Parker." Underlined three times.

130
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:37,700
We're not quite together yet. Sorry. What do
you mean, I must be Kristen's ex-husband?

131
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:41,100
That's her daughter, and this is
a totally ex-husband thing to do.

132
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,700
You'd know because that's
a totally ex-wife remark.

133
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,200
You know, I have a day. Taxi!

134
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:50,000
Taxi!

135
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,300
Get those fish. Let's go. Come on.

136
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,100
Wait, wait, wait! You forgot your fish!

137
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,500
Pier 56, please, as fast as you can.

138
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:05,600
- I don't wanna sit next to him, Daddy.
- I don't wanna sit next to her, Mommy.

139
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,200
Come on. Over the top.

140
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:10,100
Would you please just take those? Thank you.

141
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:16,900
I don't know why you have an attitude. It's
your fault they'll probably miss the field trip.

142
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:22,100
- Not Central Park West. Broadway's faster.
- My attitude is derived from your attitude.

143
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:26,600
- Derived? You must be a writer.
- Let me guess. Your ex-husband is a writer.

144
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,300
No. My ex-husband is a musician.

145
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,300
I don't need to see that.
I already have an opinion of you.

146
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,100
And I of you.

147
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,400
Liza! Liza, thank God you're home.

148
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:46,300
- I need a huge favor.
- Melanie? Is that you? You sound awful.

149
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:51,000
Where are you? Don't answer. I can't talk.
I'm on the other line organizing a fun run.

150
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:54,000
No, wait. Don't hang up. I really need you to...

151
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,700
Bye, honey.

152
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,900
- Hello? Hello!
- Yeah, I'm here.

153
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,300
- What's the matter?
- There's this guy,

154
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:09,000
who obviously thinks a minor amount of
charm replaces integrity and commitment,

155
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:14,100
has not only ruined my day but Sammy's
as well. He's completely missed his field trip.

156
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:18,200
- My mom hates your dad.
- So? My dad hates your mom.

157
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,400
- So?
- So?

158
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:24,000
Hey, it's me. I just wanna know
if you're wearin' panties.

159
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:27,000
What color are they?

160
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,200
Lew, I need this photo approved now.

161
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:33,900
If I ever act interested in another man again,
would you please shoot me?

162
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,400
- No, don't take 57th across!
- Pink?

163
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,600
- Pink? Sure.
- When is Jack getting in?

164
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:44,400
No, I will not leave Sammy at the Ninth Street
drop-in center, Liza. He hates it there.

165
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,900
You're my sister.
How can you not watch him?

166
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,400
I have to meet my boss in 15 minutes.

167
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:54,100
Then I have this presentation, which
could add up to a huge promotion for me.

168
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,400
And you have no job, a nanny,
a cook and a housekeeper.

169
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,900
The nanny is taking Courtney
to Mommy and Me.

170
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,600
Angela is cooking all day for
our dinner party tonight. Berta is cleaning.

171
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:08,200
- And I'm working at the school this morning.
- What about later?

172
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,900
Later I'm getting dressed
for our dinner party tonight.

173
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,500
- Why don't you get a nanny?
- Because I can't afford a nanny, Liza.

174
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,400
You're with a girl, aren't ya? You dog, you!

175
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:25,000
A real superwoman. Can't open
her door, won't shut her mouth.

176
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:28,600
Excuse me. Are you talking about me?

177
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:32,300
The first lady. We're thinking
about doing a piece on her.

178
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:38,200
You're insulted because I said I had
a presentation and you don't work.

179
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,200
I do work, Melanie.
I am the CEO of this household.

180
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:45,000
I'm sorry I can't help you out.
But you're perfect. You'll figure it out.

181
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,100
OK. OK. Bye.

182
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:04,400
OK, OK. Stay with me. There are cars.

183
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,900
Oh, thank God! It's still here!

184
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,800
- This is it.
- That's not it. There's nobody in there!

185
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:18,300
- Maybe they're upstairs.
- Upstairs.

186
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,400
Sammy, wait for me.

187
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,400
- I got it.
- No, I'm fine.

188
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,500
OK. Excuse me.

189
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,300
Go, go! Watch your step.

190
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:46,000
- It was the first boat. I'm telling you.
- There wasn't anybody on the first boat!

191
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:53,300
- Oh, no!
- It's OK. We can still make it. Goddammit!

192
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,300
Hey!

193
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,500
Hey, boat! Hey!

194
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,700
Hey, come here! Come back!
I got kids over here!

195
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:12,200
Come back! Hey!

196
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,300
I got kids here!

197
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,300
Goddammit!

198
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:34,000
Who wants to go on a boat
in the rain anyway?

199
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,700
I know. You did.

200
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:42,000
All right. Listen. Melanie.

201
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:47,400
I feel awful about this. I'm gonna
make it up to you. You too, kiddo.

202
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:50,000
All right?

203
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,200
OK.

204
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:57,200
Here's an idea. I watch the kids right now
while you do your presentation.

205
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,500
I heard you say you had one in 15 minutes.

206
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:05,600
And you watch her for me later today while
I do the column. It'll only take an hour or so.

207
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,100
Hi! Maggie Taylor calling.

208
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,700
I have an urgent message
for stupid Sammy Parker.

209
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,400
I'm not stupid. You're stupid.

210
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:19,400
I don't think so. I only let incredibly
responsible people watch my son.

211
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,400
I'm incredibly responsible.

212
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,600
- I'm hungry, Daddy.
- Want a Tic Tac?

213
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,000
- No.
- That's all I got.

214
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:30,100
Here, baby.

215
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,700
- What's that?
- A muffin. Thank you, Melanie.

216
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,200
You're welcome, sweetheart.

217
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,500
You were saying?

218
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I was saying that maybe we could
just help each other out today.

219
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,900
Well...

220
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,300
Hey!

221
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,600
- Looks like you missed the boat.
- I guess we did.

222
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,600
I really don't need your help, but if I did,

223
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:07,900
you would be the very last
person I would turn to.

224
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,700
These are the class fish. They were
supposed to be back in the classroom at 8:30.

225
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,100
Now they are spending the day with you.

226
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,000
God, I am going to be so late.
I have such a day.

227
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,700
- A bus!
- But, Mom...

228
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:23,800
- Those aren't toys, honey.
- Mom, that's not your phone. Mom!

229
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:27,700
Don't be like that when you grow up.

230
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:39,000
She just drops off the... bag of cookies...
and tells me to keep 'em for a week.

231
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:41,500
How do you feel about the cookies, Jack?

232
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:45,400
Love the cookies.
Have a big problem with the...

233
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,200
- Cookie-maker?
- That's right.

234
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,900
The cookie-maker thinks
that all I am interested in

235
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,700
or all that I'm capable of handling
with respect to the cookie in question

236
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,700
is the...

237
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:03,700
- The frosting?
- Exactly. Exactly.

238
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:08,700
Just because the frosting is my specialty
doesn't mean that I can't do more.

239
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:12,900
I have many layers to me.
And they're not all vanilla, either.

240
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:16,500
I have chocolate in me.
I have a deep, dark chocolate...

241
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,000
I'm still hungry, Daddy.

242
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:23,300
- Darling, let Doc Martin and I finish.
- But what about the cookies?

243
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,800
Just a little while. OK?

244
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,000
I'm sick of angry, resentful...

245
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,100
fish...

246
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,900
who think that you owe them,

247
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,700
but who won't trust you for a second
to do anything for 'em.

248
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,500
- There are other fish in the sea.
- Yes, I know.

249
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:52,500
It's just... I wish I could find a fish
who wasn't afraid of my dark-chocolate layer.

250
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,200
And she'd have to love my cookie too.

251
00:19:55,700 --> 00:20:02,500
You know, I think that my ex... cookie-maker
has turned me off to fish entirely.

252
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:06,600
I met a real piece of work this morning.

253
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,400
Tell me about her, Jack.

254
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:13,200
This fish was a fox.
She had her own cookie too.

255
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:18,300
But what a female dog.
She shoved her fish in my face...

256
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,400
In front of the cookie?

257
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:24,500
What's she doing with another fish anyway?
Is she AC/DC?

258
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:31,400
- What are you talkin' about?
- Fish... with other fish, in front of cookies.

259
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,200
Fish.

260
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,500
Fish fish.

261
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,700
I see.

262
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,200
- After you.
- No, after you.

263
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,900
- I insist.
- I insist more.

264
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,200
You can't make any noise in the office.
I have a really important meeting. OK?

265
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,600
- Don't touch that.
- It's empty.

266
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:16,200
Sammy, I'm really late and I don't
need you spilling anything right now.

267
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:21,500
- Please don't do that now.
- Why not?

268
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,100
Because I want you
to practice being super-quiet.

269
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:31,100
OK. Now stay next to me.
Here's your dinosaur.

270
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,700
- You're kidding.
- Please don't give me a hard time, Evelyn.

271
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,200
- I'm also 20 minutes late.
- 25 minutes late.

272
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,700
Mr Leland, as you might expect,
is displeased.

273
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,900
- What are those?
- The Haskell blueprints.

274
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,100
- Rob Wilding got them in ahead of schedule.
- He did?

275
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,300
Why would you bring a child here?

276
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:58,700
Remember when Sally brought her kid here
with the poison sumac?

277
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:02,000
Mr Leland just smelled the calamine lotion
and had to leave.

278
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:07,300
He does not have poison anything. He's not
even sick. He just missed his field trip.

279
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:10,600
- I don't think so.
- Five minutes. Please?

280
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:13,700
And I would be doing this because...?

281
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,500
Of our sense of solidarity.

282
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,800
We're both women, and this is
a tough office and a tough world...

283
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,300
- Five minutes.
- Thank you.

284
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,700
Evelyn, has Miss Parker come in yet?

285
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:29,400
- Miss Parker, you're late.
- Yes, I know. I'm sorry, sir.

286
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:33,300
- You're late.
- Let me go get the model. I'll be right in.

287
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,600
Sammy!

288
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:41,100
Oh my God.

289
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,100
Let me look at it.

290
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,800
Oh my God.

291
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,100
Evelyn, would you ask
Miss Parker to come in, please?

292
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,300
No.

293
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,100
She'll be right in.

294
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,700
Put this in the back room for me, please.

295
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,100
Go, go, go.

296
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,200
You! Get behind the desk and stay there!

297
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:14,400
I'm sorry, sir. I forgot. The model
is still in the model shop downtown.

298
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,600
I'm heading there right now to...

299
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:22,400
I went by there this morning to pick it up
for this meeting, but the shop was locked.

300
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:27,000
But I promise you, you are going to
love the model, Mr Leland, sir,

301
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:30,800
and today at two the people from
Yates and Yates are going to love it too.

302
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,900
- I assume you're ready.
- Of course.

303
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,600
There's something I'd like to show you.
Evelyn, bring in the Haskell blueprint.

304
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,800
What an adorable little boy!

305
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:47,900
Also, check if my amoxicillin prescription
still has refills available.

306
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,700
- Mommy...
- That's a good idea. Let's go find your mom.

307
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:59,200
I'm very sorry, sir, but someone spilled
my coffee all over the Haskell blueprints.

308
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,800
Oh my God.

309
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:04,700
Do you know that every Thanksgiving
I catch strep throat?

310
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:08,400
Healthy children can give you
strep throat from other kids

311
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,900
without your even going near them.

312
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,500
My sister sets up a kids' table
in the next room, and I still get strep throat.

313
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,700
We're going to go find his mother, sir.

314
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,200
She must work in the law offices
across the hall.

315
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:23,300
I'm sure she does.

316
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,200
Excuse me.

317
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,800
- Hello?
- You asshole!

318
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,400
- What?
- Get over here.

319
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:33,300
The mayor's called
a press conference at five o'clock.

320
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:37,600
While you were talkin' about pink panties,
your story was turning to shit!

321
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,900
You know, Miss Parker,

322
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:46,600
I don't need to remind you what the Yates
account would be worth to this firm.

323
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:49,700
- And, by extension, to you.
- No, sir.

324
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,600
Do you know what I think of
when I look at him?

325
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,000
- No.
- A carrier monkey.

326
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:01,100
He's not a carrier monkey, sir.
He looks like a healthy little...

327
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,900
I'll go find his mother.

328
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,500
Oh my God. What am I gonna do?

329
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,100
I'm really sorry, Mommy.

330
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:20,300
It's OK, sweetie. It's really not your fault.

331
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,200
It's Maggie's daddy's fault.

332
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,600
Slow down.

333
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:32,200
- This isn't a very good breakfast, Daddy.
- That's an advantage of being an adult.

334
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,200
You get to act like a kid
any time you feel like it.

335
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,300
Mommy would never let me have
hamburgers for breakfast.

336
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,500
You see what I mean?

337
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,700
- Hello.
- Who's that?

338
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,300
- Who's this?
- Who's this?

339
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,900
- Who's this?
- Who's this?

340
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,800
What are you doing
with my daughter's phone?

341
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:53,100
Damn. We must've switched. I'm Jack Taylor.
Our kids are in schooI together.

342
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,500
- "You Don't Know Jack" Taylor?
- That's me.

343
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,000
Oh my God! You're so adorable.

344
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,200
- I love your column.
- Oh, thanks.

345
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,400
- Are you married?
- I'm divorced. What's your name?

346
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,000
- Rita.
- Rita.

347
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,500
Listen, Jack. I've got to go get exfoliated.

348
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:11,100
- Now, Melanie has your phone, right?
- That's right.

349
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,400
- So what is that number?
- Pennsylvania 3317.

350
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,600
- Pennsylvania. So cute. 3317.
- My dad used to...

351
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,600
Darling, if you speak with her before I do,
would you do me a favor?

352
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:25,000
Her sister phoned me to see
if I would baby-sit Sammy later on.

353
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:29,900
But I'm in the middle of my Spring Spa Day
at Elizabeth Arden. I can't cancel now.

354
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,700
But tell her that otherwise
I would have been happy to baby-sit.

355
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,700
No matter what she thinks,

356
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:41,100
I have forgotten all about Sammy
putting my wedding ring up his nose.

357
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,900
- I'll tell her, Rita.
- You're adorable.

358
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,400
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

359
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,500
- Hello?
- It's Jack Taylor.

360
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,300
- How did you get this number?
- You're holding my phone.

361
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:57,400
- This is so typical of you.
- Let's skip the hostilities and do messages.

362
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,700
- Fine.
- Your mother's at a spa day so can't baby-sit.

363
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:04,500
It's not because she's upset about
Sammy sticking her ring up her nose.

364
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:09,200
His nose. Thank you. You have
a press conference at five. Goodbye.

365
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,700
Maybe we ought to arrange
to switch our phones back.

366
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:16,400
Tomorrow when we drop
the kids off at school. On time?

367
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,100
- Fine.
- Fine.

368
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:25,300
Maggie, when you grow up and you are
incredibly beautiful and intelligent

369
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,100
and possess a certain sweetness

370
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:34,000
that's like a distant promise
to the brave and to the worthy,

371
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:40,200
can you please not beat to a pulp every
miserable bastard just because you can?

372
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,300
Can you just not do that?

373
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:45,300
- OK, Daddy.
- All right.

374
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:01,100
- Let me help you.
- It's OK. I got it, I got it.

375
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,800
- OK, sweetie. Come on.
- Stupid American woman.

376
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,900
That guy called you stupid.

377
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,300
I am stupid sometimes, honey.
But I'd rather be stupid than sorry.

378
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,700
- How bad is it?
- Well, it's modular.

379
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:23,000
So it's conceivable I could
lift out the damaged portion

380
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,400
and replace it from the mockup.

381
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:29,700
- So I wouldn't have to start from scratch.
- Vincent, that's brilliant!

382
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:33,800
Sammy, honey. You cannot
run around here. OK?

383
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:36,900
- It won't be perfect.
- I'm thirsty, Mommy.

384
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,100
It's OK.

385
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,600
I know you, Mel. You won't be happy
with less than perfect.

386
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:46,100
- Today I will.
- I can't get the straw apart, Mommy.

387
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:51,200
I don't even wanna think about what'll
happen if I don't have that model by two.

388
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:54,400
- All right, then. I'll give it a try.
- Thanks.

389
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,400
Now, while I'm doing my column,

390
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:04,700
you need to think of at least 600 fun things
to do, cos the rest of the day is yours.

391
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:09,300
I already know, Daddy. I wanna go to the zoo
and on a horse-and-carriage ride

392
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:13,700
and to the carousel and to the Natural
Museum of History and to The Cats...

393
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,100
It's Cats, not The Cats.

394
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,800
- Hi, Jack.
- Hey.

395
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,900
Hi, Jack. I didn't know you had a daughter.

396
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,100
- Yeah, this is Maggie.
- She's so cute.

397
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,900
- She looks just like you.
- She'll grow out of it.

398
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,100
- Why are all the girls talking to you like that?
- Like what?

399
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,500
"Hi, Jack."

400
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,600
- Hi, Jack.
- Hey, Celia.

401
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,800
See what she just did?

402
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:42,100
You know, I'm doing a story on men like you.

403
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:46,400
- Oh, yeah? What's the hook?
- Just an expression my mother used to use.

404
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:50,200
"Love your guy like a little boy
and he'll grow into a man."

405
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,200
Jack! Get in here!

406
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,700
Fish! You're not gonna believe
the morning that I have had already.

407
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,300
You look cranky. You back on that diet?

408
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:08,200
- Honey, remember Lew?
- We haven't seen each other in a long time.

409
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:11,900
I am cranky, Jack, and I ate
a very good breakfast this morning.

410
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,500
- We're in big trouble on your garbage story.
- No, we're not.

411
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,900
- Come here, honey.
- It's OK. Go ahead.

412
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
This is Lois Lane.
She lives here in the newsroom.

413
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,300
Wow!

414
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:26,800
Wanna pet her, sweetheart?
Go ahead. She won't bite.

415
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:31,800
- You got a raging scoop disease, my friend.
- Which is what you love about me.

416
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:38,300
Stay here and play with the kitty, honey,
while me and your daddy go have a talk.

417
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,000
That's a girl.

418
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:43,400
- Let's go.
- Now, would you rather that I wasn't first?

419
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,700
- I'd rather you were right.
- I am right.

420
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:51,300
OK. Who told you that the mayor's reelection
campaign took contributions from the Mob?

421
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:55,100
- Manny Feldstein.
- Manny Feldstein told you, on the record,

422
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,500
"Newark trucking company
Grace and Marra, a Mob front,

423
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:01,300
made an illegal contribution
to the mayor's campaign."

424
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:05,900
- That's right. On the record.
- In exchange for the city sanitation contract.

425
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:08,100
- On the record.
- Awarded without bidding.

426
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:10,700
To Grace and Marra.
That's right. On the record.

427
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:14,100
Manny Feldstein's gonna say
he never talked to you!

428
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:18,500
- What? Hey. What?
- At the mayor's press conference today

429
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,700
- Hi, Jack.
- Feldstein's gonna say you made it all up.

430
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,900
- You didn't, did you?
- Of course not.

431
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,600
Manny told me he saw
the campaign accounts.

432
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:30,100
$250,000 was deposited
in unnumbered accounts.

433
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:33,900
Freddy, hold page three.
We may have to print a retraction.

434
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,600
- Of what?
- You're gonna give me an ulcer.

435
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:41,600
- I can feel it. Couldn't you get two sources?
- Remember the Cardinal O'Brien story?

436
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:44,600
- We almost got fired!
- I almost got the Pulitzer prize.

437
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:52,600
It's real simple, Jack. Management doesn't
wanna clean up after you anymore. Not now!

438
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:56,600
- I'm a good reporter, Lew.
- No. You are a great reporter.

439
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:00,200
But sometimes you get too excited
and get me too excited.

440
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:02,900
And now I've given you
enough rope to hang us both.

441
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:06,200
And, Jack, nobody almost
gets a Pulitzer prize.

442
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:09,300
- They won't fire me. My picture's on buses.
- I said that.

443
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,900
Then they asked me
to lunch with Frank Burroughs.

444
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,600
- Dad?
- Frank Burroughs?

445
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:18,600
- "Frankly Speaking" is a popular column.
- He's a pompous, arrogant, humorless ass!

446
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,700
Who's won the Pulitzer prize.

447
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:25,600
I'm not gonna lose my job. I got alimony
and shrink bills, old college loans to repay.

448
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,700
- Daddy...
- One second.

449
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,900
I have a plumbing situation.

450
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,300
Now, Manny has been my guy all year long.

451
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,800
One second, darling.

452
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:37,800
I played bridge with his mother.
I took his niece to Cirque du Soleil.

453
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:43,100
Just one second. I had to sit through
him playing Tevye in dinner theater, Lew!

454
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,200
- Dinner theater!
- Jack!

455
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:49,400
I gave you this column, and I love you like
a son. But I can't cover for you anymore.

456
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:53,000
You've got six hours to that
press conference and no other leads.

457
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,900
Get Feldstein back on the record or find
another source to confirm this thing.

458
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,500
Otherwise we're printing a retraction.
And I guarantee you, Jack, it'll be your last.

459
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:06,000
That's fine. If you need me,
I'm at a different number today.

460
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:08,900
- Where are you goin'?
- To find Manny.

461
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
- Take care of yourself, kid.
- I will.

462
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:17,000
Hi, Jack. Listen. I really wanted
to say something to you, Jack.

463
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:20,600
I've noticed that you haven't
been dating for quite a while.

464
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:23,600
- Right.
- Actually, we've all noticed.

465
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,800
Hey, there we go. Hi.

466
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:30,300
I know that you're sensitive,

467
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,500
but frightened.

468
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,100
I'm gentle,

469
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,400
but brutal.

470
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:40,800
Think about it. Think about me, Jack.

471
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,600
I will.

472
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,700
OK.

473
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,000
Brutal.

474
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:04,500
Marla? Have you seen my daughter?
Have you seen Maggie?

475
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,500
- No, I haven't.
- Excuse me, please.

476
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,700
Have you seen my daughter? No?

477
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,800
Maggie? Damn it!

478
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:14,100
Hey, Jack.

479
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:16,700
Hi, Daddy.

480
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:22,100
"Hi, Daddy?" Do you do this with
your mother, this wandering-off thing?

481
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,900
- Yeah.
- Cos it's not a good thing to do.

482
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,300
Now I've gotta go talk to a guy downtown.

483
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,600
It's kind of a tricky thing
and I only have one shot at it, so...

484
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:34,500
- I can't come?
- That's right. What am I gonna do with you?

485
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:41,000
This is incredibly difficult for me, but you are
the absolute last person I can think of to ask.

486
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,700
I'm really in a bind. I could lose my job.

487
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:47,500
I know you're recording but...
Can you hold on a minute?

488
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:54,300
I know you're recording
but it would just be for an hour.

489
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,500
From two to three.

490
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:02,100
Come on, Eddie. You're his father.

491
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:07,300
Fine. Never mind. I'll think of something.

492
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:11,100
Are you at least coming to his soccer game?

493
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,400
Six. It would mean a lot to him.

494
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,200
- Mel!
- Sammy!

495
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,200
Sammy, get off of that.

496
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:21,300
Time out!

497
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,800
What is the matter with you?
You almost broke it again!

498
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:34,000
Why can't you play quietly for five minutes?
Don't you realize how important this is?

499
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:37,600
- I'm taking you to the drop-in center.
- I don't wanna go there.

500
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,700
- Too bad.
- Those kids'll beat me up.

501
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,100
- They won't.
- They will.

502
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:46,400
Well, you're just gonna have to be brave.
Vincent, I'll be back in an hour for the model!

503
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,200
When the little hand
gets between 4 and 5, that's 4:30.

504
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:54,100
- I'm sorry.
- You're not being punished. I'll be back.

505
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,600
- We can go to your soccer game.
- That's too long.

506
00:36:56,700 --> 00:37:02,200
Sweetheart, I set the alarm and I'll be here
for you by the time it goes off. I promise.

507
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,600
- But I don't wanna go in there.
- But it'll be fun!

508
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:12,200
Look! It's Superhero Day!

509
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:14,900
Hey! Spiderman!

510
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,500
He can't come in here. He's not a superhero!

511
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,900
Oh, yeah? You guys sure about that?

512
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:26,000
- He doesn't look like one.
- He looks like a poo-poo crybaby.

513
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:31,000
When the big hand gets to there,

514
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:34,200
and the little hand gets to there,

515
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:36,600
- then...
- You'll be back.

516
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Wait a minute.

517
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,800
Now you're wearin' Daddy's watch.

518
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:54,600
- But I don't have a costume.
- A costume?

519
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,200
OK. How about...

520
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:03,700
Bessie the choreographer?
Five, six, seven, eight!

521
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:10,200
I don't have... You know,
I don't have a costume, darling.

522
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,800
Hey.

523
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:18,800
Hey, Maggie. Look, honey. Maggie.

524
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:21,300
- Hi, Sammy.
- Hi, Maggie.

525
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:26,100
- You said you weren't gonna bring him here.
- Well, I got desperate.

526
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,900
Me too.

527
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:33,200
So, looks like we need
two superheroes - and fast.

528
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:39,700
Mama said there'll be days like this

529
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,400
There'll be days like this, Mama said

530
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,000
Mama said, Mama said

531
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:46,300
Mama said there'll be days like this

532
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,000
There 'll be days like this, my mama said

533
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:50,500
Mama said, Mama said

534
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:53,200
I went walking the other day

535
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:55,900
And everything was going fine

536
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:01,300
I met a little boy named Billy Joe
and then almost lost my mind

537
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,700
Where do you get a bag like that?

538
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,500
Mama said there'll be days like this...

539
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:11,000
If those mean boys give you any more
trouble, first go to the teacher.

540
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:15,000
If she doesn't help, call me on the mobile.
And if you can't reach me, call 911.

541
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:17,300
Kick the mean boys in the shins.

542
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,700
- Bye!
- Bye!

543
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:29,500
- Thanks for doin' that.
- Sure. It's hard enough being a kid.

544
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:33,700
- It is excellent.
- And you would know.

545
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:36,300
- What's that?
- Nothing.

546
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,500
- Know what my mother told me?
- Gee, no.

547
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:44,200
"Love your guy like a little boy
and he'll grow into a man."

548
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:46,500
- She knew you were gay?
- I'm not gay.

549
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:51,100
- Then why the advice about loving guys?
- She hoped I'd meet a woman like that.

550
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:55,700
I can't stand those people who blame their
worst traits on everyone but themselves.

551
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,900
It's so '90s.

552
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,900
What are you talkin' about?

553
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,100
You're blaming your Peter Pan complex
on your mother.

554
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,700
- Do you have any friends?
- I don't have time.

555
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,600
That's because of
your Captain Hook complex.

556
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,800
- My what?
- Captain Hook complex.

557
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:14,500
- There's no such thing.
- Yes, there is. And you have it.

558
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,000
- Here's your phone back.
- Here's yours.

559
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,200
Thank you!

560
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:36,500
Hey! Feldstein!

561
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,700
- Hey!
- I can't meet with you right now, Jack.

562
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,100
Hey, Manny!

563
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,600
Manny!

564
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,200
- Hey, Manny.
- Please don't hit me.

565
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:33,100
- I won't. What's goin' on?
- I've been having thoughts.

566
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,800
- We already had our thoughts.
- Please don't yell.

567
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:39,500
You were the one who said to me
this garbage thing stinks.

568
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:43,400
I waited for a month for you
to get comfortable with this.

569
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:46,700
We print the story. It runs on the front page.

570
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:50,700
And now you tell me you are having
thoughts? What is the matter with you?

571
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:55,500
I've been having trouble with my medication.
You get the dose wrong, you get grandiose.

572
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:59,800
We talked about takin' down the mayor
and the Mob together. That's crazy.

573
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,500
- No, it's not.
- It is!

574
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:05,100
Now that I'm a little better regulated,
I realize they will kill me!

575
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,700
Hey, listen to me.

576
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:11,500
Don't do this to me.
All right? Look at me. Hey.

577
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:16,100
I'm the one who started your standing
ovation for "If I Were a Rich Man," right?

578
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:19,600
- I can't do it.
- You can do it. You're my guy.

579
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:23,400
I got a wife and a family. I'm their guy too.
You're hurting my neck.

580
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,700
Yeah. Oh, yeah. All right.

581
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,000
I'm sorry, Jack.

582
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:33,900
- All right. Gimme a name.
- I can't think of any names.

583
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,100
- Whose name is on the account?
- I don't know. I only saw numbers.

584
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:40,600
- Who set up the account?
- I don't know.

585
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:44,100
- Who set up the account, Manny?
- Eddie McCoy, maybe?

586
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:46,300
Maybe Eddie McCoy? How...

587
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:52,400
You know what? I'm gonna figure it out
myself. OK, Manny? Thank you.

588
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:06,700
- Hello?
- Mommy.

589
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:10,200
- What happened?
- I don't wanna stay here anymore.

590
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:12,300
And neither does Maggie.

591
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:16,000
- Sweetie, you have to, just for a little while...
- No.

592
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:17,400
What happened?

593
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:21,700
Spiderman kicked me
and She-Ra took Maggie's snack.

594
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,300
Let me talk to the teacher.

595
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:27,400
She's outside talking to the Hulk
about not using the F-word.

596
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,900
Sammy, you'll just have to be brave and...

597
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,800
- What's LSD?
- LSD?

598
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:38,400
Spiderman was talking to Maggie
about LSD that he got from his brother.

599
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,400
Don't move. Stay right where you are.
You will both be picked up in ten minutes.

600
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:51,200
No. Manny's a dead end.

601
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:54,600
- You get anything?
- McCoy probably set up the account.

602
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:57,400
As campaign manager,
he wouldn't implicate himself.

603
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,600
- City comptroller?
- He'll never talk.

604
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:02,700
- How about the sanitation commissioner?
- Lieberman?

605
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,500
Metro!

606
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,500
- How do we get ahold of Lieberman?
- He's in Barbados.

607
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:10,800
- He's in Barbados.
- The sanitation commissioner in Barbados?

608
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:14,800
- During a garbage scandal.
- Maybe the mayor wanted him outta town.

609
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:17,000
- Metro!
- What?

610
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:21,600
- What's Lieberman doin' in Barbados?
- He's there with his new girlfriend.

611
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:26,400
- He's there with his new girlfriend.
- Which leaves his very angry wife.

612
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:29,300
- Bingo.
- I'm in the lobby. I'll be right up.

613
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,500
- Yeah?
- Jack, it's Melanie Parker.

614
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:46,400
We have a problem with our kids. They're OK
but they have to be picked up right now.

615
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:47,800
- Can you do it?
- Me? Now?

616
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:52,100
I'd definitely jeopardize my career
and my life if I picked them up now.

617
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:56,600
I'd definitely jeopardize my career
and my life if I picked them up now.

618
00:44:56,700 --> 00:45:01,100
But your press conference isn't
until five. My presentation is at two.

619
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,900
I gotta see Elaine Lieberman
for some information.

620
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,700
- Can't you phone?
- Yeah...

621
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:08,300
- Great.
- Isn't there anybody else you can call?

622
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,900
- I wouldn't be asking you if there were.
- Yeah.

623
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,100
I could watch them both from three o'clock
until your press conference ends

624
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:19,400
if you'll watch them both
from now until three.

625
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:22,700
- You're asking me for help.
- It would appear that way.

626
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:26,000
I'll agree if you say
"Please be my knight in shining armor."

627
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:29,700
Jack, don't be a shithead.
Go rescue our kids.

628
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:32,100
This is hard for you, isn't it?

629
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:34,100
Are you agreeing or not?

630
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:36,300
You know, I got a day too.

631
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:41,300
Sorry. I'll meet you and the kids in my
office lobby at Rockefeller Center at 3:15.

632
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,100
- Fine.
- Fine.

633
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:50,300
Marla, tell Celia to get Elaine Lieberman's
home number and call me on my cell phone.

634
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:52,300
No...

635
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:54,900
What?

636
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:58,900
I forgot to tell you.
Sammy is allergic to shellfish and dander.

637
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:04,000
He's not allowed to watch commercial TV.
He has to hold your hand crossing the street.

638
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:07,700
Also, if you go to the playground,
check the sandbox first.

639
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:11,300
You never know what people
throw in there. Also...

640
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,500
OK. Bye.

641
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:16,300
Fine.

642
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:18,600
Fine.

643
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:20,700
One fine day

644
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,900
You'll look at me

645
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:31,500
And then you'll know
our love was meant to be

646
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:36,000
One fine day

647
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:43,400
You're gonna want me for your girl

648
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:51,600
The arms I long for

649
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:55,000
Will open wide

650
00:46:56,600 --> 00:47:01,800
Then you'll be proud to have me
right by your side

651
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:04,900
Hello.

652
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,600
- Hi. It's me.
- Me who?

653
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:09,100
- Do you have the kids?
- What kids?

654
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,800
You didn't pick up the kids?

655
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,700
Oh, you mean those kids.

656
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:19,100
- I was just calling...
- To check up on me cos you don't trust me.

657
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,600
Sammy, no! Put the gun down.

658
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:25,200
You only asked me to watch Sammy
out of sheer desperation.

659
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:31,100
Part of you would feel safer with him at the
Ninth Street drop-in center with LSD. True?

660
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:36,900
No, that is not true. I only wanted to warn you
that Sammy can get into trouble faster

661
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,800
than you can make most women smile.

662
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:42,300
Are you flirting with me?

663
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:46,600
- Would you please just pay attention to him?
- I won't let him out of my sight.

664
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:49,300
Sammy! Hey! Guns aren't toys.

665
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:51,500
- It's not loaded.
- Goodbye!

666
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:59,100
Sammy, how long have
your mom and dad been divorced?

667
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:03,100
I don't know. It doesn't matter really
cos she said she'll always love him.

668
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,500
- Yeah? Hey, what's that?
- A marble.

669
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:09,500
- You get to see your dad a lot?
- Yeah, pretty much, usually.

670
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:12,900
He has a different schedule than
other daddies. He's a drummer.

671
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:17,200
But his favorite thing to do is watch me
play soccer. He's probably coming today.

672
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:21,900
He's taking me fishing this whole summer.
Just us. And maybe Mom will come too.

673
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,100
- Your dad's a drummer, huh?
- Yep.

674
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:26,300
- Sounds like a great guy.
- He is.

675
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:37,700
- Kurt, Jake, you remember Melanie Parker.
- Nice to see you. Nice to see you.

676
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,900
Well... voila.

677
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:16,000
I love this. This is... What is that?

678
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:19,200
- A vaulted...
- Vaulted pediment. Vaulted pediment.

679
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:21,700
- I love that.
- Yeah?

680
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:28,700
- But I need to see this with cars.
- You don't, Dad. Just use your imagination.

681
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:32,100
My imagination?
I have to see it with the cars.

682
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,100
Cars.

683
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:46,100
See?

684
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:57,600
- She's quite a little discovery.
- Yes, she is.

685
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:02,200
Why don't you join us
for drinks this evening?

686
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:05,600
Let's say 5:30, at the 21.

687
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:08,100
I... I don't know if I can.

688
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:14,100
We'll talk about this project. From what I've
seen, you could bring a great deal to this.

689
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:23,300
- I'll be there.
- Terrific. That's great.

690
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:28,100
Hi. This is Jack Taylor.
I'm looking for Elaine Lieberman.

691
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:30,800
- You're trying to be like my dad.
- Am not.

692
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:34,400
- Daddy, who's that man on the bus?
- One second, darling. What?

693
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:36,900
- Who's that man?
- It says "Frankly Speaking."

694
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,600
Very important. Elaine Lieberman.

695
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:41,700
Here we go. Hold hands.

696
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:46,500
Rosa... Rosa... Could you
just try to speak English?

697
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:48,700
- OK.
- OK.

698
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:51,600
- Hello?
- Hello.

699
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:54,200
Right, OK. I need...

700
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:00,600
I need... pronto... her.

701
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:06,500
- OK.
- OK? OK. Bye-bye.

702
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:08,800
No, no.

703
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:14,200
Rosa, listen.

704
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:17,600
- I need to find Mrs Lieberman.
- OK.

705
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:20,800
OK. If I don't find her, I could lose my job.

706
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:24,400
If you don't understand, say "OK."

707
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,200
- OK.
- OK.

708
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:29,400
OK. Bye-bye. Gracias. Bye-bye.

709
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:35,700
Gimme that marble! It's my dad's!
Give it! It's my dad's marble.

710
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:37,700
No. Rosa?

711
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,900
No, Rosa...

712
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:42,700
No, no, don't hang up.

713
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:45,200
- Do you speak Spanish?
- What do you need?

714
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:49,700
OK, great. Her name is Rosa Lopez.
Her boss is Elaine Lieberman.

715
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:53,200
I need to know where she is.
I'm Jack Taylor. I'm a reporter.

716
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:58,200
Elaine's her boss.

717
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:02,400
Say Elaine wants to speak to me very badly.

718
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:06,600
Jack Taylor.

719
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,400
- So?
- So give it!

720
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:13,200
- Give it!
- No.

721
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:17,400
Hey, guys. Guys! What are you doin'?

722
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:21,800
- Guys, what are you doin'?
- Mr Kelly? Mr Kelly.

723
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:28,700
Senora Lopez said Mrs Lieberman is at the
Elizabeth Arden salon for her Spring Spa Day.

724
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:30,200
- Excellent.
- Dad!

725
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,500
What? You guys are being...

726
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:34,500
Oh, man.

727
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:38,000
- You're so stupid.
- Am not.

728
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:42,900
Are so. You ruined my dad's marble. He's not
gonna want it with your snot all over it.

729
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:45,500
Yes, I will. I'll just wash it off.

730
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:48,900
You'll be fine. The doctor's
just gonna pop it right out.

731
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,600
- How come you couldn't do it?
- It's a little nose, big marble.

732
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:58,600
But the doctor has this clamp thing that's
gonna come up and just yank it right out.

733
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:03,300
And you are gonna be fine. You just gotta
not worry about it and not think about it.

734
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:07,000
You gotta think about something else.
You gotta think about...

735
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:09,200
Hello, Sammy.

736
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:29,900
- Hello?
- Hi, sexy. I miss you.

737
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:34,700
Look, whoever you are,
this isn't Jack's phone anymore.

738
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,900
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

739
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:40,400
- No. Who are you?
- This is Celia.

740
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:43,400
I'm a friend of Jack's. And who's this?

741
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:46,400
- Absolutely nobody.
- Whatever.

742
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:51,000
Could you tell him Kristen called from the
Bahamas to let him know her number there?

743
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:56,600
And this is very important. Elaine Lieberman
will only be at Elizabeth Arden's until 3:30.

744
00:53:56,600 --> 00:54:00,800
So if you could pass on those messages,
we'd both appreciate it.

745
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:05,500
Your mom will kill me if I don't have
you guys in the lobby by 3:15 on the dot.

746
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:09,300
- She won't kill you. She's not like that really.
- She isn't?

747
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:13,200
No. She just acts tough and mean
cos she'd rather be safe than sorry.

748
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:17,000
- What does that mean?
- She says it when men try to open her door.

749
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:18,400
Yeah?

750
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:23,600
Go, go, go, go, go!

751
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:34,100
-Hi,you guys!
- Hey!

752
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:38,300
Yourfriend... Celia called to tell you...

753
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,900
- Sammy?
- It's OK. It's only an escalator.

754
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:43,100
Kristen called you from the Bahamas.

755
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:48,400
And also, Elaine... Lieberman
will be at Elizabeth Arden's until 3:30.

756
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:52,300
- Great.
- Thank you so much for watching Sammy.

757
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,900
Really, you saved my life.

758
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:57,200
- Was he any trouble?
- No. Not at all.

759
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:58,700
Good.

760
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:01,500
So, everything worked out great.

761
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:05,200
I was sure you'd either show up
three hours late or not at all.

762
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:09,300
- I'm not like every other man you know.
- I realize that. I was kidding.

763
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:11,300
No, you weren't but...

764
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:14,200
I'm not like every other woman you know.

765
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:16,800
- Really?
- Yeah.

766
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:20,900
You probably think I'm a real control freak.
And I'm not, at all.

767
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,900
Well, I mean, I do like things
the way I like them, but who doesn't?

768
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:30,100
And, anyway, in my life I'm the only one who
ever does anything so... what does it matter?

769
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:34,100
Maybe you should let somebody
help you out every once in a while.

770
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:37,000
Definitely not. I've got
all these balls up in the air.

771
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:40,600
If somebody else caught one
for me, I'd drop them all.

772
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:44,300
- But you're not a control freak?
- No. I'm a single, working mother.

773
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,800
OK. I have more work to do than time to do it.

774
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:52,600
So before we get into yet another lengthy
and exhausting thing, I have a career to save.

775
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:57,200
- Do you have any instructions for me?
- No, no. I trust you completely.

776
00:55:58,100 --> 00:56:03,500
I don't suppose you could
switch your thing from 5 to 4:30?

777
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:06,400
I just found out that
I have a new thing at 5:30.

778
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:09,200
- I can't switch.
- I'll switch mine. No problem.

779
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:12,900
- OK. I'll see you guys at the soccer game.
- Bye, Jack!

780
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:16,900
- Thanks again, Jack.
- You're welcome.

781
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:24,900
I realize it's difficult,
what with Celia, Kristen, Elaine...

782
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:28,000
I know your name, Mel.

783
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:10,900
So what'd you guys do with Jack?

784
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:14,900
Quit kicking me, Maggie.
I wasn't gonna say anything about...

785
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:16,800
About what?

786
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:20,600
It's a secret. We're not supposed to say.

787
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:22,900
Secret about what?

788
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,900
- About your dad?
- And you too, Mommy.

789
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,500
Me too?

790
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:31,000
Come on, you guys. Tell.

791
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:35,900
A secret about me and Jack.

792
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:41,300
Does it have anything to do with feelings?

793
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,100
- What do you mean?
- You know. Feelings.

794
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:48,600
Like being scared or hurt or...
or happy and excited.

795
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:53,800
- Those are all feelings.
- Definitely about feelings, then.

796
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:56,500
Yeah. Definitely.

797
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:01,100
Switch.

798
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:07,000
- Sorry, Mom.
- It's OK, honey.

799
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:15,700
- So what'd you get?
- Frozen hot chocolate.

800
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:20,200
- You like chocolate?
- I love chocolate.

801
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:24,400
Daddy told Dr Martin that he's got
deep, dark chocolate inside of him.

802
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:26,400
Really?

803
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:31,800
And that he'd like to meet a fish who
wasn't afraid of his dark-chocolate layer.

804
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:34,600
I think I'm beginning to guess the secret.

805
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:37,400
- Are you mad?
- Not really.

806
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:42,100
- He should have talked about it with me.
- He was afraid you'd hate him.

807
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:44,300
Of course I wouldn't hate him.

808
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:46,400
Honestly, that is so silly.

809
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:52,000
You don't understand. This is an emergency.

810
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:55,800
I don't interrupt Mrs Lieberman
during her bikini wax.

811
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:59,200
- Now listen.
- Don't bother with the cute face.

812
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:04,200
I have five sons. You make eyes at me
like that, I make you pot roast.

813
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:07,700
Excuse me. Hello, Mrs Kempner.
Let me get your robe.

814
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,400
- Goodbye, Mrs Lieberman.
- Next week.

815
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:17,500
Down, please.

816
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:33,900
Is Mrs Lieberman here? No? OK.

817
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,500
- Hi.
- Hey. Hi.

818
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:41,600
Hey, is Mrs Elaine Lieberman
in here, by any chance?

819
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:44,000
It's OK. Sorry.

820
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:48,000
- Hi. I'm looking for Elaine Lieberman.
- She just left.

821
00:59:48,100 --> 00:59:51,000
- Thank you.
- Jack! Is that you?

822
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:53,600
- Yeah.
- It's Rita.

823
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:56,800
Melanie's mother.

824
00:59:56,900 --> 00:59:58,900
- Rita. Hey.
- Sorry.

825
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:03,000
- What a small world.
- I spent the afternoon with your grandson.

826
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:06,200
- He's cute, but a handful.
- I need to find Elaine Lieberman.

827
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:10,100
I wanna tell you one thing about Melanie.
Something you may suspect.

828
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:14,300
She can make you scream like you're having
a body wax. She's that frustrating.

829
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:16,900
Inside, Jack, she's mush.

830
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:19,900
- Mush?
- So you scream all you want.

831
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:23,900
- But just don't run away too soon.
- OK. All right. Bye.

832
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:26,000
Bye-bye. You're adorable.

833
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:31,700
- Mrs Lieberman?
- Right there.

834
01:00:31,700 --> 01:00:34,900
Hey, Mrs Lieberman! Mrs Lieberman!

835
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,700
Mrs Lieberman! Jack Taylor! Daily News!

836
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:42,100
- Get in.
- All right!

837
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:47,100
I'm glad I finally found you.

838
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:50,600
- I have to ask you a difficult question.
- About my husband.

839
01:00:50,700 --> 01:00:56,200
- Do you know about his business affairs?
- Are you referring to the illegal account?

840
01:00:56,300 --> 01:00:58,800
- So you know about that?
- It's in his name.

841
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:01,700
- Yeah.
- I have the deposit slips.

842
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:05,100
- I don't suppose you'd...
- Go on the record?

843
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:09,100
- I know it's a lot to ask.
- Elaine Lieberman. E-L-A-I-N-E

844
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:12,000
L-I-E-B-E-R-M-A-N.

845
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:15,000
- I only have one request.
- Anything at all.

846
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:18,200
- Fax him a copy in Barbados.
- All right.

847
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:23,600
- Hello.
- Hi, darling.

848
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:26,300
Mom. Thank God. I'm in big trouble.

849
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:32,300
I have to have drinks with clients at 5:30
or I'll be fired. I have absolutely no childcare.

850
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:36,900
When are you done at Elizabeth Arden's?
Sammy! Put that down! You'll break it.

851
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:39,900
You only think about work.
What about your personal life?

852
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:46,500
Actually, Mom, today I thought a lot
about my personal life. Don't laugh. I did.

853
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:48,400
Come here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

854
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:55,700
Kitty?

855
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:58,000
Kitty! Kitty?

856
01:01:58,300 --> 01:02:01,400
What do you mean, don't be
my usual self with him?

857
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:03,800
My usual self can't be all that bad

858
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:07,600
since I'm pretty sure Jack told
the kids he has feelings for me.

859
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:10,800
- He wants to ask me out on a date.
- Divine.

860
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:13,200
Maggie? Sammy, where's Maggie?

861
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:16,800
Take that out of your nose.
What is the matter with you?

862
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:20,300
Excuse me. And the thing is, I'm...

863
01:02:20,900 --> 01:02:23,300
I think I could have feelings for him too.

864
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:27,600
Or at least I think I might be able to,
which is... it's a big step up for me.

865
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:29,400
Mom, could you hold on?

866
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:30,800
Maggie?

867
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:36,300
Well, I had no idea from that floating head
on top of his column that he was so tall.

868
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:40,700
And he's got good color in his skin,
which you also couldn't tell from the photo.

869
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:43,000
He really is altogether yummy, Mel.

870
01:02:43,100 --> 01:02:46,500
- How would you know?
- Because he was just here, darling.

871
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:51,100
This isn't some horrifyingly elaborate
matchmaking scheme, is it? Maggie!

872
01:02:51,700 --> 01:02:54,100
- Of course not, darling.
- Maggie!

873
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:59,000
- Oh my God. I just lost his daughter!
- You lost his daughter?

874
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,100
Maggie!

875
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:07,000
Maggie! Oh my God.

876
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:09,900
Excuse me. Have you seen a little girl?

877
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:14,000
Excuse me. Have you seen a little girl?
She's about six years old.

878
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:16,500
Excuse me, sir. Have you seen a little girl?

879
01:03:16,700 --> 01:03:19,800
Excuse me! Have you seen
a little girl about six?

880
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:22,600
Maggie!

881
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:28,500
Have you seen a little girl about six?

882
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:34,700
Excuse me! Have you seen...

883
01:03:37,300 --> 01:03:39,400
Maggie!

884
01:03:42,100 --> 01:03:43,900
Maggie!

885
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:50,900
Maggie!

886
01:04:08,900 --> 01:04:11,100
- Well, hello.
- Hi.

887
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:15,400
- Anything else you can tell us, Miss Parker?
- I don't think so. I just...

888
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:19,500
He's still not answering. I can't believe it.
One minute she was there...

889
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:23,700
- I understand but...
- You don't. I just met this guy this morning.

890
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:25,900
And I was horrible to him all day!

891
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,200
- Excuse me.
- You're shivering. Jimmy...

892
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:33,700
Why was I so horrible to him! I called him
immature and uncharming and irresponsible!

893
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:36,500
- I was my usual self, she said.
- I need to find my purse.

894
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:39,900
Excuse me, but I've lost a little girl!
I'm sorry.

895
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:43,900
She said "Don't be your usual self"
and I was my usual self!

896
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:48,600
And he took perfect care of my son while
I did my presentation, which went very well!

897
01:04:48,700 --> 01:04:51,700
And then I lost his daughter!
How could I have done that?

898
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:56,800
- It probably wasn't your fault.
- I didn't even pay my bill from Serendipity!

899
01:04:57,100 --> 01:04:59,200
Is that your mom?

900
01:05:05,700 --> 01:05:09,600
Mrs Lieberman... Elaine...
You have saved my life.

901
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:12,700
Watch your head.

902
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:20,600
That was smart.

903
01:05:22,700 --> 01:05:24,400
- Jack.
- Mike.

904
01:05:26,100 --> 01:05:28,100
I love you, Lew.

905
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:32,300
I love this town. I love this job.
I love Elaine Lieberman.

906
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:36,900
- That's a lot of love for you, Jack.
- I gotta tell you. I met someone today.

907
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:41,200
- What are you talkin' about?
- I don't know how to describe her.

908
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:44,200
She's luminous. Her face is...

909
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,200
- You're talkin' about women.
- Yeah.

910
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:49,800
Your ass is on the line. Are you nuts?

911
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:53,500
That is under control. I have
Elaine Lieberman on the record.

912
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:56,000
And she has proof of a campaign account.

913
01:05:56,100 --> 01:06:01,700
She's an angry wife. Her husband just sends
her a sorry-gram and she's off the record!

914
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:05,100
- You have my word.
- Your word means nothing to management.

915
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:08,600
Make sure Elaine Lieberman
gets to that press conference.

916
01:06:08,700 --> 01:06:12,100
Either she confronts the mayor
or I have to print a retraction.

917
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:14,300
Don't worry. Elaine's my girl.

918
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:16,500
I hope so, Jack.

919
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:19,200
Jack? I just had lunch with Frank Burroughs.

920
01:06:19,300 --> 01:06:23,400
Very bright. Very funny. Very humble man.

921
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:25,800
- You love me, Lew. You know you do.
- Yeah.

922
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:30,300
Come on, Lois. Come on. Go ahead. That's it.

923
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:32,400
Hey, Lew? Lew!

924
01:06:32,500 --> 01:06:35,000
- Where's Jack?
- On the way to city hall.

925
01:06:35,100 --> 01:06:37,300
But I have urgent messages for him.

926
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:43,000
I can't sit here like this.
I gotta go find Jack.

927
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:49,900
He's gonna be at city hall
in 15 minutes. Come on, honey.

928
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:56,800
Uh-huh. Five o'clock. That's great.

929
01:06:56,900 --> 01:06:58,100
Hang on!

930
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:00,300
Elaine, excuse me one second.

931
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:02,300
City hall, please.

932
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:07,200
- Look, I can't thank you enough.
- Duane! Please. City hall.

933
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:12,800
I'll do my best to get there. I was on my way
to Staten Island so I might be a little late.

934
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:14,400
All right? Bye.

935
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:15,700
Duane! Hurry up.

936
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:26,700
- Hello.
- Mr Taylor? Lt Bonomo, 18th Precinct.

937
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:28,900
We found your daughter.

938
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:30,800
What?

939
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:44,000
- Excuse me. Have you seen Jack Taylor?
- No, I haven't.

940
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:49,300
Excuse me. You don't happen
to know Jack Taylor, do you?

941
01:07:49,300 --> 01:07:53,400
- Very well, in fact.
- You're... Celia, aren't you?

942
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:57,500
Yes. And you must be the one
who lost his little girl.

943
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:02,700
- Hello! Maggie!
- Daddy!

944
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:04,300
- Hey! Hi.
- Hello.

945
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:08,100
Hey, I'm Jack Taylor. That's mine.
Thank you very much for watching her.

946
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:10,700
- It was my pleasure.
- I'm sure it was.

947
01:08:11,500 --> 01:08:13,800
- Come on.
- I wanna play with the kitties.

948
01:08:13,900 --> 01:08:19,600
I gotta go to a press conference. Hi, kitties.
Come on. Tag - you're it! Chase me. Let's go.

949
01:08:19,700 --> 01:08:23,300
- No. I wanna play with the kitties.
- Come on. Red light, green light.

950
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:26,800
- Stop it!
- Let's go. Maggie, don't do this right now.

951
01:08:26,900 --> 01:08:29,900
Don't you understand? If I don't get there...

952
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:34,200
- No, Daddy, no! Stop it!
- Do you want me to lose my job?

953
01:08:46,900 --> 01:08:50,400
- You really love those kittens, right?
- Yeah.

954
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:55,600
OK. Come on. Come here.
Watch your head. There.

955
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:00,400
OK.

956
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:02,500
What are their names?

957
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:05,500
This one's Bob cos he looks like a bobcat.

958
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:10,100
And that one's Fred, and that one's...

959
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:12,200
I forget this one's name.

960
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:19,000
OK. Listen, Maggie. I know that
this has been a rotten day for you,

961
01:09:19,100 --> 01:09:22,400
and I know all you wanna do
is play with these kittens.

962
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:25,100
I don't blame you cos they're great.

963
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:31,200
But if I don't get to this press conference, I'll
lose my job. And I don't wanna lose my job.

964
01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:35,300
So we gotta work somethin' out.
We gotta make some kind of a deal here.

965
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:39,600
So... what if we talk
to this beautiful young lady

966
01:09:39,700 --> 01:09:43,900
and we ask her if maybe Bob can come
to the press conference with us?

967
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,600
You mean keep him?

968
01:09:46,700 --> 01:09:49,800
- Borrow him.
- But I wanna keep him.

969
01:09:51,100 --> 01:09:54,700
- You'll have to ask your mother about that.
- She's allergic.

970
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:57,300
Oh, that's right. She gets all...

971
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:02,800
All right. You know what?

972
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:04,900
Bob can just stay at my house.

973
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:07,600
Where would he sleep?

974
01:10:07,700 --> 01:10:12,300
You know that room with all the boxes in it?
We could clear it out. He could sleep there.

975
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:14,500
- That's a good idea.
- Yeah.

976
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:19,400
Of course you're gonna have to come over
and visit every once in a while to check up.

977
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:22,900
Make sure I'm feedin' him and everything.

978
01:10:22,900 --> 01:10:25,500
- I will.
- Yeah?

979
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:28,700
Come here.

980
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:37,500
You know, maybe what we oughta do

981
01:10:38,700 --> 01:10:41,300
is put a bed in that room for you too.

982
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:45,500
Yeah.

983
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:48,300
- Cos he might get lonely.
- Yeah.

984
01:10:49,100 --> 01:10:52,000
But he's not gonna get lonely with you there.

985
01:10:55,100 --> 01:10:57,400
Let me take a look at this guy.

986
01:10:57,500 --> 01:10:59,700
So this is gonna be our cat, huh?

987
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:01,900
- Bob.
- Hey, Bob.

988
01:11:03,900 --> 01:11:06,700
Now can we get outta here already?

989
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:12,800
Mr Mayor! Mr Mayor!

990
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:15,000
Mr Burroughs?

991
01:11:15,100 --> 01:11:18,000
Do you plan to sue
Jack Taylor and the Daily News

992
01:11:18,100 --> 01:11:22,700
for the apparently false, unsubstantiated
charges they've made against you?

993
01:11:22,900 --> 01:11:25,100
Hey, that's not a bad idea.

994
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:32,800
- Hey, Dad. That guy's on the bus too.
- Hurry, please.

995
01:11:32,900 --> 01:11:35,500
- His picture's bigger than yours.
- You speak English?

996
01:11:35,700 --> 01:11:38,700
Last question, please.

997
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:41,300
Excuse me! Excuse me.

998
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:44,000
Last question, please.

999
01:11:46,700 --> 01:11:50,000
- Mom, you're not a reporter.
- I gotta do something.

1000
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:52,100
- Mr Mayor!
- Mr Mayor!

1001
01:11:52,300 --> 01:11:54,300
- What are you gonna say?
- I don't know.

1002
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:56,700
- Mr Mayor!
- Yes?

1003
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:00,300
- You, on the right.
- I...

1004
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:03,400
- What about Elaine...
- Lieberman.

1005
01:12:03,700 --> 01:12:05,600
- Lieberman!
- What about her?

1006
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:09,300
She's my sanitation commissioner's wife.
She has nothing to do with this.

1007
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:12,000
What paper are you with, young lady?

1008
01:12:12,100 --> 01:12:17,400
I believe Mrs Lieberman has spoken to Jack
Taylor and can back up everything he said.

1009
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:21,400
Jack Taylor is a reckless man
with a gift for manipulating the truth.

1010
01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:23,600
I... I know Jack Taylor, sir,

1011
01:12:23,700 --> 01:12:28,300
and... and... and... and he is
pretty cocky most of the time

1012
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:33,200
and he does seem to have somewhat of
a cavalier attitude, but at least he's honest.

1013
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:36,800
I don't know what relationship
you have with Mr Taylor,

1014
01:12:36,900 --> 01:12:40,900
but you clearly know nothing
about politics or journalism.

1015
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:44,000
That's it. No more questions. Thank you.

1016
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:50,600
Melanie!

1017
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:55,400
Look, Melanie. I got a kitty!
His name's Bob and Dad said I can keep him!

1018
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:58,400
- Mr Mayor?
- Jack, Elaine Lieberman didn't show up.

1019
01:12:58,500 --> 01:13:01,600
- I know that. Mr Mayor!
- No, no, no, Mr Taylor.

1020
01:13:01,700 --> 01:13:03,700
The press conference is over.

1021
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:07,300
Mr Mayor, you may be able
to strong-arm Manny Feldstein

1022
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:12,500
and to buffalo my paper into printing
a retraction, and they may actually fire me.

1023
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:16,800
- But we both know this garbage thing stinks.
- Pitiful, Mr Taylor.

1024
01:13:16,900 --> 01:13:20,900
You and your little friend in the outfit.
Just pitiful!

1025
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:24,400
What is pitiful, Mr Mayor, is that
if I had a few minutes more,

1026
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:29,300
Elaine Lieberman would be here
with a canceled check for $250,000,

1027
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:31,700
from a very well-known Mob front,

1028
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:34,300
made out to your reelection campaign.

1029
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:39,300
That's a blatant fabrication! We both know
that no such canceled check exists!

1030
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:43,200
You know, you're right. I'm confused.
There would be no check.

1031
01:13:43,300 --> 01:13:46,800
But there would be a deposit slip.
Wouldn't there, Elaine?

1032
01:13:46,900 --> 01:13:50,100
- Come here. Hi. Can I have that, please?
- Hello, Sidney.

1033
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:57,100
All right. This is dated March 15 of this year.
It is a deposit slip for $250,000.

1034
01:13:57,200 --> 01:14:03,500
That same day a deposit was made
into your campaign account for $250,000.

1035
01:14:03,500 --> 01:14:06,500
But I guess that was just a coincidence.

1036
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:09,700
The press conference is over! I said over!

1037
01:14:09,900 --> 01:14:11,800
How'd you discover the account?

1038
01:14:11,900 --> 01:14:15,400
- Elaine, what can I say?
- Jack, it was my pleasure.

1039
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:18,700
- Can I see that document?
- In the paper tomorrow, Frank.

1040
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:21,200
You guys wanna go
to the soccer game? Come on.

1041
01:14:21,300 --> 01:14:25,600
- All right. My public. Who first?
- Does your husband know you've done this?

1042
01:14:25,700 --> 01:14:29,300
My husband. Funny you bring that up.
He's in Barbados. B-A-R-B-A-D...

1043
01:14:29,700 --> 01:14:32,000
That was an excellent moment in my life.

1044
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:33,600
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1045
01:14:33,700 --> 01:14:36,400
- Can we go to the soccer game now?
- Yes, sweetheart.

1046
01:14:36,500 --> 01:14:39,900
- Yeah, boy. Come here.
- I really am so sorry about Maggie.

1047
01:14:39,900 --> 01:14:43,600
- I don't wanna think what could've happened.
- Me neither.

1048
01:14:43,700 --> 01:14:49,100
I can't believe I was issued shellfish
and dander warnings. Sandbox alerts.

1049
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:52,100
You laughed in my face
when I came to your office on time.

1050
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:54,700
- I know.
- And then you lost my daughter.

1051
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:57,100
It was the worst thing I could've done.

1052
01:14:57,200 --> 01:15:00,900
- I really am so sorry.
- So someone else is the irresponsible one.

1053
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:04,900
- Yes, they are.
- I'd like to hear you say that for your kind.

1054
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:08,300
- My kind?
- The ones with all the balls in the air.

1055
01:15:08,300 --> 01:15:11,600
- It's the least you could do.
- Of course I'll say it, Jack.

1056
01:15:11,700 --> 01:15:14,700
I was the irresponsible one. Taxi!

1057
01:15:14,700 --> 01:15:17,800
- Now say "I can't do everything on my own."
- Why?

1058
01:15:17,900 --> 01:15:21,800
Because with one sentence
you can restore my faith in women again.

1059
01:15:21,900 --> 01:15:24,600
- Of course I'll say it for you, Jack.
- OK.

1060
01:15:25,300 --> 01:15:27,900
- We'll never get a cab.
- You can't say it.

1061
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:31,900
- Sure I can, but it won't be true.
- I'm waitin'.

1062
01:15:32,700 --> 01:15:35,400
- OK. I can't do everything alone.
- There. Great.

1063
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:39,200
Even though my daily activities
year after year contradict that.

1064
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:41,200
Unbelievable!

1065
01:15:41,300 --> 01:15:44,300
- You made me grovel for no reason.
- For a great reason.

1066
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:46,800
You are an arrogant ball-juggler, baby.

1067
01:15:46,900 --> 01:15:49,700
First of all, don't call me "baby."

1068
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:53,200
If you don't want your balls juggled,
don't throw them in my face.

1069
01:15:53,300 --> 01:15:57,800
- I never threw them in your face.
- You thrust your stupid column at me

1070
01:15:57,900 --> 01:16:00,900
as a lame excuse for my son
missing his field trip.

1071
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,600
Balls in my face.

1072
01:16:03,700 --> 01:16:07,600
Big Jack Reporter can't possibly
concentrate on mundane details like

1073
01:16:07,700 --> 01:16:13,200
phoning to say "Thanks, but I won't need
you to take my daughter to school today."

1074
01:16:13,300 --> 01:16:17,800
And then you have to ask who I assume
is one of your many girlfriends

1075
01:16:17,900 --> 01:16:22,600
if she's wearing her panties,
as loud as you can! Balls in my face!

1076
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:27,100
And now, in the midst of
my obvious remorse, you make me grovel?

1077
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:30,200
First of all, I thrust my column in your face

1078
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:36,800
because I thought you were the most
beautiful woman that I have ever seen, and I...

1079
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,800
I wanted to make a good impression.

1080
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:50,100
I forgot to call you this morning
because I, as opposed to you,

1081
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:53,200
am not used to doing everything on my own.

1082
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:59,800
As for the panties, that remark was directed
to my editor Lew simply to piss you off.

1083
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:06,000
Come on, Dad. I've got a taxi. Can we go?

1084
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,900
Hey. Look who got the cab.

1085
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:20,400
- I think my dad likes your mom.
- Maybe my mom likes him back.

1086
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:22,900
Men like you have made me the woman I am.

1087
01:17:22,900 --> 01:17:27,800
All the women I know like you
make me think all women are like you.

1088
01:17:27,900 --> 01:17:32,100
Oh my God. I almost forgot.
I've got a meeting. Drinks with clients.

1089
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:34,700
It's 5:25. You're never gonna make it.

1090
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:39,500
Mom! It's the last game of the season.
It's for the championships, Mom.

1091
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:43,300
The coach said every kid has to play
or they don't get a trophy.

1092
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:47,400
Even the losers get one.
But you don't get a trophy if you don't play.

1093
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:50,900
- I know, but it's on the way. We'll make it.
- Let go of it.

1094
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:54,300
I can't let go of it. It's my job.

1095
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:56,500
Hold this.

1096
01:17:57,100 --> 01:18:01,100
Could we go to the 21 Club instead?
21 West 52nd Street.

1097
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:05,400
And don't try to take 14th
or 32nd or 44th across.

1098
01:18:05,500 --> 01:18:08,400
You can't make a left at this hour.

1099
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:12,600
I know I can do this.

1100
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:18,100
- No, don't take Broadway. Try Sixth Avenue.
-  Great green gobs of...

1101
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:21,900
-  Greasy, grimy gopher guts
- But after 23rd because of the construction.

1102
01:18:21,900 --> 01:18:25,100
-  French-fried eyeballs floatin' in a bowl of...
-  Snot

1103
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:27,300
Snot.

1104
01:18:58,700 --> 01:19:00,800
Here we go.

1105
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:06,600
Why don't you hold the cab? If I'm not back
in 15 minutes, go on ahead without me.

1106
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:09,800
- You'll take longer than 15 minutes.
- I can do this.

1107
01:19:09,900 --> 01:19:12,100
OK, baby.

1108
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:15,400
Mommy, what if you don't come
and Daddy doesn't come?

1109
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:20,400
Oh, sweetheart, I'm going to be there. You are
the most important thing to me in the world.

1110
01:19:20,700 --> 01:19:24,200
- Your job is.
- No. You are.

1111
01:19:24,900 --> 01:19:27,200
But I have to do this now.

1112
01:19:27,300 --> 01:19:32,000
Sammy, I know I've dragged you places and
left you and I've been a crazy person today.

1113
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:37,200
But it's going to be better tomorrow. And
I promise I won't take longer than 15 minutes.

1114
01:19:37,300 --> 01:19:39,400
OK? Huh?

1115
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:45,500
Hey, Sammy, come here.

1116
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:50,100
Don't worry. She'll make it.
Let's get ready for soccer. Grab me that bag.

1117
01:19:54,500 --> 01:19:56,800
- Hello. How are you?
- I see my party.

1118
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:02,200
I'm glad you could make it.
What's your poison?

1119
01:20:02,300 --> 01:20:04,900
- I'll just have some water.
- Nonsense.

1120
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,100
You have some catching up to do.

1121
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:12,100
She'll have a dry vodka martini, straight up.

1122
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:19,300
Hey. What are you thinkin' about, kiddo?

1123
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:22,800
I hope my daddy can come
to our soccer game.

1124
01:20:22,900 --> 01:20:25,000
Yeah.

1125
01:20:26,500 --> 01:20:29,200
Mommy hopes he can come too.

1126
01:20:29,300 --> 01:20:31,200
Last night...

1127
01:20:31,300 --> 01:20:35,500
Last night my mom thought I was asleep
but I really wasn't.

1128
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:41,300
And I heard her say over and over: "Please
let Eddie come. Please let Eddie come."

1129
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,900
- Eddie? Who's Eddie?
- Eddie's my dad.

1130
01:20:48,700 --> 01:20:50,800
I hope he comes too, kiddo.

1131
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:56,800
We were just discussing plans for
an upscale amusement complex for adults.

1132
01:20:56,900 --> 01:21:00,400
- You know. With food and games and rides.
- No rides, Dad.

1133
01:21:00,500 --> 01:21:03,300
After drinks, we wanted
to take a drive to Stamford.

1134
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:07,600
We were hoping to take a look at
a bad version of what we have in mind.

1135
01:21:07,700 --> 01:21:13,600
Before we head out, Melanie, maybe you'd
toss out a few ideas off the top of your head.

1136
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,500
Well...

1137
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:23,300
Adult amusement complexes, up until now,
have been somewhat cheesy.

1138
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:27,000
Usually attached to
popular video stores and...

1139
01:21:28,100 --> 01:21:32,200
What I'm thinking of is
something a bit more exciting.

1140
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:36,800
A drawing might help. Don't you think?

1141
01:21:36,900 --> 01:21:39,300
- I...
- I love drawings.

1142
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:42,100
I don't have a...

1143
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:44,900
OK.

1144
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:50,500
Let's see. Something like...

1145
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:07,000
Isn't that the little lost boy
from this morning?

1146
01:22:08,200 --> 01:22:10,000
With... You know...

1147
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:32,900
You know... I can't do this now.

1148
01:22:34,700 --> 01:22:37,700
And I can't go with you
to Stamford now either.

1149
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:45,200
Yes, Mr Leland, that is the little lost boy from
this morning. Only he's not lost. He's my son.

1150
01:22:45,900 --> 01:22:49,600
I have a child and he has
a soccer game in 20 minutes.

1151
01:22:49,700 --> 01:22:54,800
If he's late, he won't get the trophy. And since
I'm in here with you, he'll probably be late.

1152
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:57,800
But what gets to me the most is,
instead of crying about it,

1153
01:22:57,900 --> 01:23:02,800
he's out there with a big old smile
blowing fish faces at us.

1154
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:10,600
Gentlemen, if you're smart, you will want me
as much for my dedication and ability

1155
01:23:10,700 --> 01:23:15,200
as for the fact that I am going to ditch you
right now and run like hell across town

1156
01:23:15,300 --> 01:23:18,400
so that my kid knows that
what matters to me most is him.

1157
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:24,500
And, Mr Leland, your real grounds for firing
me should be if I were to stay here with you.

1158
01:23:28,500 --> 01:23:31,000
- I like her.
- A lot.

1159
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:39,700
Well, I probably lost my job! But at least
we still have ten minutes to get to the game!

1160
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:41,400
Hey, shortcut!

1161
01:23:41,500 --> 01:23:46,900
In spite of everything, Jack, I do
sincerely apologize for losing Maggie.

1162
01:23:46,900 --> 01:23:49,500
That's OK. It happened to me this morning.

1163
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:53,700
- You lost Maggie this morning?
- Yeah. She wandered off after the office cat.

1164
01:23:53,800 --> 01:23:57,500
It might have been helpful if you had
mentioned her tendency to wander.

1165
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:00,800
Yeah, well, it might have been helpful...
Here we go. Up here!

1166
01:24:00,900 --> 01:24:06,200
..if you had mentioned Sammy's tendency
to stick things up his nose!

1167
01:24:06,300 --> 01:24:08,800
- He didn't!
- Oh, yeah! Way up there!

1168
01:24:08,900 --> 01:24:11,200
The doctor had to use this plier-type thing.

1169
01:24:11,300 --> 01:24:16,300
It's called an alligator.
A tool I have come to know well.

1170
01:24:16,500 --> 01:24:19,100
- OK!
- Hey, get up. Here we go.

1171
01:24:21,700 --> 01:24:24,500
See? I told you we'd make it.

1172
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:30,100
- Any other catastrophes?
- Lois Lane ate the class fish.

1173
01:24:30,200 --> 01:24:32,400
Why does that not surprise me?

1174
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:35,100
- Sorry, Sammy.
- Lois Lane?

1175
01:24:38,200 --> 01:24:40,500
Come on! We gotta hurry up!

1176
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:42,500
I gotta go to the bathroom.

1177
01:24:42,700 --> 01:24:45,100
- I'll take you.
- Why don't I take her?

1178
01:24:57,300 --> 01:25:01,300
So, Maggie, you know that lady,
Celia, from your dad's office?

1179
01:25:01,400 --> 01:25:04,000
Yeah.

1180
01:25:04,100 --> 01:25:07,000
- Is she your daddy's girlfriend?
- No way.

1181
01:25:08,300 --> 01:25:10,400
She wants to be, but she isn't.

1182
01:25:11,300 --> 01:25:15,900
He wants somebody who would love
his cookie too, and Celia's not the type.

1183
01:25:17,200 --> 01:25:19,700
Let me get that other sock for you.

1184
01:25:22,900 --> 01:25:26,600
There's no king when love is the thing

1185
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,700
Play the same rules

1186
01:25:32,900 --> 01:25:37,600
In a heartbeat, a wise man can be a fool

1187
01:25:39,700 --> 01:25:44,300
Through the darkest hours

1188
01:25:45,200 --> 01:25:47,800
When all is said and done

1189
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:53,000
It has the power

1190
01:25:53,700 --> 01:25:56,600
You go from lonely to the lucky one

1191
01:25:56,800 --> 01:26:00,000
Cos love 's funny that way

1192
01:26:01,100 --> 01:26:04,000
No matter who you are

1193
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:07,800
Oh, it can shake your faith

1194
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:12,600
Or it can break your heart

1195
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:14,000
Yeah, yeah

1196
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,200
There we go.

1197
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:21,600
Give me that.

1198
01:26:21,700 --> 01:26:23,800
That's my cat.

1199
01:26:26,100 --> 01:26:30,000
So maybe you and Maggie could
come over for dinner after the game.

1200
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,700
Order out a little Chinese or something.

1201
01:26:34,700 --> 01:26:37,300
- Oh, thank God he's here.
- Dad!

1202
01:26:42,500 --> 01:26:46,900
- So what do you say?
- I don't think so. It's been a long day.

1203
01:26:49,200 --> 01:26:53,100
OK. Yeah, I'm a little... a little tired myself.

1204
01:26:55,300 --> 01:27:00,800
- I should go over and say hi to Sammy's dad.
- I like to watch the game on the sidelines.

1205
01:27:01,700 --> 01:27:03,800
OK.

1206
01:27:04,700 --> 01:27:06,800
- It was a good day.
- Yeah.

1207
01:27:07,300 --> 01:27:09,400
OK.

1208
01:27:22,500 --> 01:27:23,900
All right. Come here.

1209
01:27:25,500 --> 01:27:27,800
What? You can't even look at me?

1210
01:27:27,900 --> 01:27:31,800
This is the second game
you've made it to in two years, Eddie.

1211
01:27:31,900 --> 01:27:34,100
- Look, I'm here, aren't I?
- Daddy!

1212
01:27:35,200 --> 01:27:37,500
Are you staying for the whole game?

1213
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:40,100
- You bet I am.
- Cool!

1214
01:27:40,100 --> 01:27:43,500
I'm gonna play my best.
You watch me. My really best.

1215
01:27:44,100 --> 01:27:46,100
That's great.

1216
01:27:46,200 --> 01:27:48,700
Go get 'em, tiger.

1217
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,100
Come on. I saved us a seat.

1218
01:27:53,900 --> 01:27:56,000
Here, Daddy.

1219
01:28:06,900 --> 01:28:08,900
Hey, Dad!

1220
01:28:13,900 --> 01:28:16,900
Part of the reason I came
was to tell Sammy in person

1221
01:28:16,900 --> 01:28:21,400
that I'm not gonna be able
to make our fishing trip this summer.

1222
01:28:21,500 --> 01:28:25,900
- You can't do this to him, Eddie.
- I got a gig playing with Bruce, Mel.

1223
01:28:25,900 --> 01:28:29,100
Can't you see how much he needs you?

1224
01:28:29,100 --> 01:28:32,100
Come on, Mel. You can't
expect me to pass this up.

1225
01:28:34,900 --> 01:28:37,600
Mom! Hey, Mom! Look!

1226
01:28:39,400 --> 01:28:41,100
Yes!

1227
01:28:59,200 --> 01:29:01,700
Let's go, Maggie! Come on! Maggie, let's go!

1228
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:04,200
Down the alley! Right down the alley!

1229
01:29:04,300 --> 01:29:07,600
Watch that kid! Bodycheck him, Maggie!

1230
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:11,400
- But that would be rude, Daddy.
- That's not rude! That's sports!

1231
01:29:11,500 --> 01:29:13,600
That's it!

1232
01:29:14,500 --> 01:29:17,100
Hey! Hey! Come on!

1233
01:29:17,200 --> 01:29:19,900
- What's with that guy?
- Get that kid!

1234
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:32,400
- Good game there, Sammy.
- Thanks, Jack.

1235
01:29:34,700 --> 01:29:37,500
- I'll see ya.
- Thanks for everything.

1236
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:39,900
You too. I'll see you.

1237
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:41,800
OK. Are you ready?

1238
01:29:41,900 --> 01:29:44,000
OK. Hang on.

1239
01:29:45,900 --> 01:29:48,200
You were great.

1240
01:29:48,900 --> 01:29:51,300
So I'll see you real soon, OK, big guy?

1241
01:29:51,400 --> 01:29:53,300
OK.

1242
01:29:53,400 --> 01:29:55,800
- Bye, Mel.
- Bye.

1243
01:30:06,600 --> 01:30:11,400
- Hey. Let's get your rain stuff on. OK?
- OK.

1244
01:30:11,500 --> 01:30:13,600
Let me see your trophy.

1245
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:22,700
- Wow! Do you think that's real gold?
- Yeah.

1246
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:26,000
- You do? What is that on his head?
- A soccer ball.

1247
01:30:33,100 --> 01:30:35,200
OK. Are you ready?

1248
01:30:42,500 --> 01:30:46,300
- Should we try to get a cab, Mom?
- No. I kind of feel like walking.

1249
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:49,800
- In the rain?
- So? You're dressed for Niagara Falls.

1250
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:55,900
Have I told you lately that I love you?

1251
01:30:58,400 --> 01:31:02,900
Have I told you there's no one above you?

1252
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:07,900
Fill my heart with gladness

1253
01:31:09,100 --> 01:31:11,100
Take away my sadness

1254
01:31:12,100 --> 01:31:15,500
Ease my troubles, that's what you do

1255
01:31:19,200 --> 01:31:22,500
For the mornin ' sun in all its glory

1256
01:31:25,100 --> 01:31:28,600
Greets the day with hope and comfort too

1257
01:31:31,900 --> 01:31:34,800
And you fill my life with laughter...

1258
01:31:36,700 --> 01:31:39,200
Mom, I'm hungry.

1259
01:31:39,300 --> 01:31:41,300
I'll be right there, honey.

1260
01:31:42,600 --> 01:31:45,100
All right. That's a deal.

1261
01:31:45,700 --> 01:31:48,200
Give me this one. Come here. Good night.

1262
01:31:48,900 --> 01:31:51,700
- Good night.
- He'll be right here in the box, OK?

1263
01:31:51,800 --> 01:31:53,500
- OK.
- All right.

1264
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:56,600
You know, when me and Melanie
were in the bathroom,

1265
01:31:56,700 --> 01:31:59,200
she asked me if Celia was your girlfriend.

1266
01:31:59,200 --> 01:32:02,400
- She did?
- Yeah. She really likes you.

1267
01:32:03,800 --> 01:32:05,700
- Good night.
- Good night.

1268
01:32:08,600 --> 01:32:10,700
She told you she likes me?

1269
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:13,000
It's so obvious, Daddy.

1270
01:32:13,100 --> 01:32:15,200
Night.

1271
01:32:16,300 --> 01:32:18,500
Did she say anything else about me?

1272
01:32:18,600 --> 01:32:23,400
I don't know, Daddy. I'm pretty tired.
I'm gonna go to sleep now.

1273
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:26,900
Yeah.

1274
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,400
- What'll you do about those fish?
- What?

1275
01:32:32,500 --> 01:32:34,100
We gotta go buy new fish.

1276
01:32:34,200 --> 01:32:36,000
- Now?
- Yeah, now.

1277
01:32:36,100 --> 01:32:40,500
Sammy can't go back to class tomorrow
without those fish. Mrs Fineman'll kill him.

1278
01:32:40,600 --> 01:32:43,800
- I'm in my pajamas!
- I know, but we gotta help him out.

1279
01:32:44,400 --> 01:32:46,400
Like the sun

1280
01:32:51,300 --> 01:32:53,400
At the end of the day

1281
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,600
We will give thanks and pray

1282
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
To the one

1283
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:09,900
Have I told you lately that I love you?

1284
01:33:12,500 --> 01:33:16,400
Have I told you there's no one above you?

1285
01:33:19,100 --> 01:33:21,400
Fill my heart with gladness

1286
01:33:22,600 --> 01:33:24,800
Take away my sadness

1287
01:33:25,700 --> 01:33:28,400
Ease my troubles, that's what you do

1288
01:33:32,500 --> 01:33:34,600
Take away my sadness

1289
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:38,700
Fill my life with gladness

1290
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:42,300
Ease my troubles, that's what you do

1291
01:33:52,500 --> 01:33:54,100
- Hi.
- Hi.

1292
01:33:54,400 --> 01:33:57,900
Maggie insisted that
we bring Sammy some new fish.

1293
01:34:00,200 --> 01:34:02,300
Thank you.

1294
01:34:05,100 --> 01:34:09,900
- Do you guys wanna come in for a minute?
- No, no. We don't wanna intrude.

1295
01:34:11,400 --> 01:34:13,100
OK. Well...

1296
01:34:13,300 --> 01:34:15,300
Yes. Here they are.

1297
01:34:16,900 --> 01:34:19,300
- OK.
- OK. Thank you.

1298
01:34:19,400 --> 01:34:21,500
Come on, Dad.

1299
01:34:22,400 --> 01:34:26,800
- Come in. Please.
- OK. For a few minutes.

1300
01:34:28,300 --> 01:34:30,300
Hi, Jack!

1301
01:34:30,600 --> 01:34:32,700
Sammy!

1302
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:36,200
What do you weigh?

1303
01:34:36,300 --> 01:34:38,700
- Wanna come see my room?
- OK.

1304
01:34:45,100 --> 01:34:49,600
- You're investigating my apartment.
- Not as neat as I would've thought.

1305
01:34:49,700 --> 01:34:53,000
It's only neat on Sundays
when my mother comes for brunch.

1306
01:34:53,100 --> 01:34:56,000
If she sees it like this, she shakes her head,

1307
01:34:56,100 --> 01:34:59,600
which means she's unhappy
with my life choices.

1308
01:34:59,700 --> 01:35:05,100
And then she lets out a sigh that means she'd
have rather gone to my sister's for brunch.

1309
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:14,500
- You guys wanna watch a video?
- Yeah!

1310
01:35:14,600 --> 01:35:17,300
- How about The Wizard of Oz?
- Yeah!

1311
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:23,800
You can get all snuggled up on my bed
and watch for a little while.

1312
01:35:25,200 --> 01:35:27,600
- I wanna watch it all, Mommy.
- It's too late.

1313
01:35:27,700 --> 01:35:31,400
You can watch for as long as it takes us
to drink one cup of coffee.

1314
01:35:31,400 --> 01:35:34,500
- Two cups of coffee.
- We'll see.

1315
01:35:40,500 --> 01:35:43,800
It's always such a dilemma
when you have kids.

1316
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:49,400
After Sammy's dad and I got divorced, I put
up pictures of him all over Sammy's room.

1317
01:35:49,500 --> 01:35:54,600
I wanted to reassure him that, no matter what,
his dad would still be in his life.

1318
01:35:55,300 --> 01:35:58,000
- You want cream, or...?
- No, that's fine.

1319
01:35:59,100 --> 01:36:02,400
- Sammy talked about him all day today.
- I'm sure he did.

1320
01:36:02,500 --> 01:36:07,200
- Is he really a rock'n'roll drummer?
- He's touring with Springsteen this summer.

1321
01:36:07,200 --> 01:36:08,600
- Really?
- Yeah.

1322
01:36:08,700 --> 01:36:11,700
Springsteen? Wow.

1323
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:20,300
You know... I'm beatin' around the bush
here and there's something I gotta ask you.

1324
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:22,200
Yes?

1325
01:36:22,200 --> 01:36:28,000
Why did you spend all day flirting with me if
you meant to get back with your ex-husband?

1326
01:36:28,100 --> 01:36:29,700
What?

1327
01:36:29,800 --> 01:36:32,900
I spent the whole day disliking you intensely.

1328
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:37,000
You were flirting with me. You even
told the kids you wanted to ask me out.

1329
01:36:37,200 --> 01:36:40,800
- I never told them that.
- Yes, you did. That was your big secret.

1330
01:36:40,900 --> 01:36:45,600
They told me. It was all about you and me
and going somewhere and feelings.

1331
01:36:45,700 --> 01:36:47,900
You were going to ask me out.

1332
01:36:48,300 --> 01:36:51,400
The big secret was that Sammy
got my marble stuck up his nose.

1333
01:36:51,500 --> 01:36:54,400
And I never once even thought
about asking you out.

1334
01:36:54,500 --> 01:36:57,800
- I'm so sure.
- I don't know why I would even want to.

1335
01:36:57,900 --> 01:37:00,600
You said I was the most beautiful woman
you'd ever seen.

1336
01:37:00,700 --> 01:37:04,800
- That was a line.
- That was not a line, Jack, and you know it.

1337
01:37:04,900 --> 01:37:08,300
You wanted me ever since
I knew you were a writer...

1338
01:37:08,400 --> 01:37:13,900
You wanted me ever since the drop-in center
when you saw me put my watch on Maggie.

1339
01:37:13,900 --> 01:37:17,000
For someone so disinterested
in the other person,

1340
01:37:17,100 --> 01:37:21,100
- you sure do remember every detail.
- You remember better than I do.

1341
01:37:21,200 --> 01:37:22,600
- I do not.
- Yes, you do.

1342
01:37:22,700 --> 01:37:25,300
- What would you do if I kissed you?
- You wouldn't.

1343
01:37:25,300 --> 01:37:27,400
What would you do if I did?

1344
01:37:28,600 --> 01:37:32,600
- Do you wanna kiss me?
- I wouldn't have mentioned it if I didn't.

1345
01:37:35,200 --> 01:37:37,300
Fine.

1346
01:37:48,600 --> 01:37:51,700
You're just... reelin' me in, aren't you?

1347
01:37:54,900 --> 01:37:57,700
You're like Roy Scheider at the end of Jaws.

1348
01:37:58,700 --> 01:38:02,900
The minute I open my mouth,
you're gonna drop a big bomb in there.

1349
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,500
Then you'll wear my teeth around your neck.

1350
01:38:06,700 --> 01:38:09,400
So you're admitting you're a big shark?

1351
01:38:11,700 --> 01:38:13,800
I am admitting that I am...

1352
01:38:15,200 --> 01:38:18,100
scared of getting close to anyone again.

1353
01:38:19,100 --> 01:38:21,600
I'm just as scared as you are.

1354
01:38:29,500 --> 01:38:31,600
- Don't bite.
- I won't.

1355
01:38:47,100 --> 01:38:49,000
- Mommy.
- What?

1356
01:38:49,100 --> 01:38:52,900
Can you fast-forward for us?
That mean lady is on and we hate that part.

1357
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:55,400
Sweetheart, you know how to fast-forward.

1358
01:38:55,500 --> 01:38:59,100
- The remote's broken.
- And she's stealing Toto.

1359
01:38:59,200 --> 01:39:01,600
There. She's gone. OK?

1360
01:39:02,200 --> 01:39:05,400
This is the colored part. You love this part.

1361
01:39:29,700 --> 01:39:31,200
- Wait.
- Yeah. OK.

1362
01:39:31,400 --> 01:39:33,400
No, let's do this right.

1363
01:39:33,500 --> 01:39:38,800
Let me go in and freshen up so I feel
more like a woman and not a dead mommy.

1364
01:39:38,800 --> 01:39:40,900
- OK.
- OK?

1365
01:39:41,200 --> 01:39:44,600
Why don't you go in and
go sit over there and...

1366
01:39:45,400 --> 01:39:50,000
close your eyes, lay your head back
and anticipate my return.

1367
01:39:50,500 --> 01:39:52,300
OK.

1368
01:39:52,400 --> 01:39:55,100
Or you can go in and watch The Wizard of Oz

1369
01:39:55,200 --> 01:39:57,300
and wait for me to come back.

1370
01:40:01,300 --> 01:40:03,400
Yeah, OK.

1371
01:40:08,900 --> 01:40:11,500
One fine day

1372
01:40:11,600 --> 01:40:14,200
You'll look at me

1373
01:40:14,200 --> 01:40:19,700
And you will know
our love was meant to be

1374
01:40:19,800 --> 01:40:22,400
One fine day

1375
01:40:22,500 --> 01:40:28,600
You're gonna want me for your girl

1376
01:40:30,600 --> 01:40:35,800
Though I know you're the kind of boy

1377
01:40:35,900 --> 01:40:40,000
Who only wants to run around

1378
01:40:41,300 --> 01:40:46,300
I'll keep waiting and someday, darling

1379
01:40:46,400 --> 01:40:51,000
You'll come to me
when you want to settle down

1380
01:40:51,100 --> 01:40:54,800
Oh, one fine day

1381
01:40:54,900 --> 01:40:57,400
We'll meet once more

1382
01:40:57,500 --> 01:41:02,900
And then you'll want the love
you threw away before

1383
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,600
One fine day

1384
01:41:05,700 --> 01:41:10,500
You're gonna want me for your girl

1385
01:41:14,400 --> 01:41:16,500
It stopped raining.

1386
01:41:20,100 --> 01:41:22,200
Jack?

1387
01:42:05,800 --> 01:42:09,800
You're out of the woods, you're
out of the dark, you're out of the night

1388
01:42:09,900 --> 01:42:13,200
Step into the sun, step into the light

1389
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,300
Keep straight ahead for the most glorious...

1390
01:42:16,400 --> 01:42:18,500
I wonder what they're doing.

1391
01:42:21,900 --> 01:42:26,100
You're out of the woods, you're
out of the dark, you're out of the night

1392
01:42:26,200 --> 01:42:28,900
Step into the sun, step into the light

1393
01:42:30,300 --> 01:42:34,400
Hold onto your breath, hold onto
your heart, hold onto your hope

1394
01:42:34,500 --> 01:42:39,200
Step into the sun, step into the light,
march up to the gate and bid it...

1395
01:42:39,400 --> 01:42:41,200
Open

1396
01:42:41,400 --> 01:42:43,500
Open

1397
01:42:57,100 --> 01:43:00,200
You got to give a little

1398
01:43:01,300 --> 01:43:03,400
Take a little

1399
01:43:03,700 --> 01:43:07,400
And let your poor heart break a little

1400
01:43:08,500 --> 01:43:10,700
That's the story of

1401
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:13,300
That's the glory of love

1402
01:43:16,200 --> 01:43:18,300
You got to laugh a little

1403
01:43:19,900 --> 01:43:22,000
Cry a little

1404
01:43:22,300 --> 01:43:26,000
Before the clouds roll by just a little

1405
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,300
That's the story of

1406
01:43:29,400 --> 01:43:31,900
That's the glory of love

1407
01:43:35,400 --> 01:43:38,800
And as long as there 's the two of us

1408
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:43,600
We 've got the world and all its charms

1409
01:43:44,700 --> 01:43:47,900
And when the world is through with us

1410
01:43:48,700 --> 01:43:52,700
We 've got each other's arms

1411
01:43:52,700 --> 01:43:55,400
You've got to win a little

1412
01:43:56,500 --> 01:43:58,600
Lose a little

1413
01:43:58,700 --> 01:44:02,500
And always have the blues a little

1414
01:44:03,400 --> 01:44:05,500
But that's the story of

1415
01:44:05,600 --> 01:44:07,900
And that's the glory of love

1416
01:44:21,500 --> 01:44:23,500
Are those your eyes?

1417
01:44:25,700 --> 01:44:27,800
Is that your smile?

1418
01:44:30,300 --> 01:44:33,600
I've been lookin ' at you forever

1419
01:44:34,600 --> 01:44:37,700
But I never saw you before

1420
01:44:38,300 --> 01:44:40,800
Are these your hands

1421
01:44:41,600 --> 01:44:44,800
Holding mine?

1422
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:52,400
Now I wonder how I could've been so blind

1423
01:44:54,500 --> 01:44:58,500
And for the first time

1424
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:02,200
I am looking in your eyes

1425
01:45:03,100 --> 01:45:04,900
For the first time

1426
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:08,600
I'm seein' who you are

1427
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:14,100
I can't believe how much I see

1428
01:45:15,100 --> 01:45:18,800
When you're lookin' back at me

1429
01:45:19,300 --> 01:45:23,300
Now I understand what love is

1430
01:45:24,200 --> 01:45:26,300
Love is

1431
01:45:27,400 --> 01:45:29,500
For the first time

1432
01:45:34,900 --> 01:45:37,300
Can this be real?

1433
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:41,400
Can this be true?

1434
01:45:43,600 --> 01:45:46,900
Am I the person I was this mornin'

1435
01:45:47,700 --> 01:45:50,800
And are you the same you?

1436
01:45:51,500 --> 01:45:54,200
It's all so strange

1437
01:45:54,600 --> 01:45:58,200
How can it be?

1438
01:45:59,800 --> 01:46:06,100
All along this love was right in front of me

1439
01:46:08,100 --> 01:46:11,700
And for the first time

1440
01:46:12,200 --> 01:46:15,400
I am looking in your eyes

1441
01:46:16,200 --> 01:46:22,000
For the first time, I'm seein ' who you are

1442
01:46:23,600 --> 01:46:27,600
I can 't believe how much I see

1443
01:46:28,200 --> 01:46:32,000
When you're lookin ' back at me

1444
01:46:32,500 --> 01:46:36,300
Now I understand what love is

1445
01:46:37,400 --> 01:46:39,500
Love is

1446
01:46:40,500 --> 01:46:43,000
For the first time

1447
01:46:48,600 --> 01:46:51,900
Such a long time ago

1448
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:59,200
I had given up on findin' this emotion

1449
01:47:00,200 --> 01:47:03,600
Ever again

1450
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:08,500
But you're here with me now

1451
01:47:08,800 --> 01:47:13,200
Yes, I found you somehow

1452
01:47:13,900 --> 01:47:19,100
And I've never been so sure

1453
01:47:29,200 --> 01:47:32,600
And for the first time

1454
01:47:33,500 --> 01:47:36,700
I am looking in your eyes

1455
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:39,700
For the first time

1456
01:47:39,700 --> 01:47:43,500
I'm seein' who you are

1457
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:48,700
I can't believe how much I see

1458
01:47:49,700 --> 01:47:54,400
When you're lookin' back at me

1459
01:47:56,100 --> 01:48:01,100
Now I understand what love is

1460
01:48:02,300 --> 01:48:05,200
Love is

1461
01:48:06,700 --> 01:48:10,000
For the first time
