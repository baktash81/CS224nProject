00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:48,833
- [Hubie] You moved here?
- I'm Walter Lambert.

174
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:50,250
Hubie Dubois.

175
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:52,166
It's a pleasure, Hubie.
I'll tell you what.

176
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:55,708
I'm gonna invite you and Mom over
for dinner once I get my kitchen set up,

177
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:58,083
'cause I make the best chili
east side of the Rockies.

178
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:00,625
Ooh. My belly just said yes
for the both of us.

179
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:02,125
[farts]

180
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:04,416
And your butt just made some room.

181
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,875
They must've got loosened out of me
with the landing.

182
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:09,583
- It's... it's fine. It's natural.
- It is.

183
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:10,541
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

184
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:12,875
Anyway, you take care, Hubie. All right?

185
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:15,166
- Yeah.
- And have a happy Halloween.

186
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:16,541
Oh, and Hubie.

187
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:19,375
If you ever hear some commotion

188
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:22,458
coming from my house,
it's nothing to be concerned about.

189
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:25,458
So, you don't need to come over
and check on me or anything.

190
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:27,500
In fact, it's important that you don't.

191
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:30,375
Sure thing, Mr. Lambert.

192
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:32,458
Walter.

193
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:36,000
Hey, I'm home.

194
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:39,458
- [shrieking laughter]
- [Hubie screams] Ah! No! Ah!

195
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:41,208
[skeleton warbles]

196
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:44,333
[woman] Did that darn skeleton
frighten you again, Hubie?

197
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:48,291
No! I was just practicing yelling, Mom.
Everything's good.

198
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:52,875
Oh, dear boy.
This town is making you so jittery.

199
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:54,291
It just breaks my heart.

200
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:56,500
I'm fine. Is that a new shirt?

201
00:08:57,541 --> 00:09:01,250
Mrs. Banerjee and I
went to the thrift store today.

202
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,791
Guess how much? Fifty cents!

203
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:06,791
"Boner donor?"
Now, what does that even mean?

204
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:10,000
Well, I think
boner's another word for a mistake.

205
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:14,083
Like, I made a big boner in math class.

206
00:09:14,166 --> 00:09:17,583
So, maybe boner donor
means I donate mistakes.

207
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:18,791
That makes sense.

208
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:22,958
I met the fellow who moved into
the Andersons' house next door.

209
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:25,208
Walter Lambert. Seemed like good people.

210
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:27,333
- Oh, well, that's nice.
- Yeah.

211
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:29,666
Some improvement over those Andersons.

212
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:32,416
The way they used to
toss firecrackers at you.

213
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,000
Oh, no. That was the Epsteins.

214
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:36,875
The Andersons used to
throw garbage into my bedroom window.

215
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:40,791
Well, who was it chased you
around the yard with a tennis racket?

216
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:41,958
That was Dad.

217
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:43,750
God rest his soul.

218
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,833
- Oh, for sure.
- [Mom] Cookies are done.

219
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:47,583
You wanna help me frost 'em?

220
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:49,791
- Can I lick the spoon, or…
- [Mom] Deal!

221
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:50,708
Okay.

222
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:57,458
[chuckles] Now, I know that Halloween
is very special to you, sweet boy.

223
00:09:57,541 --> 00:10:00,416
It's been your favorite holiday
since you were knee-high.

224
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:05,958
Well, we're Jewish, so that eliminated
Christmas and Easter and Ash Wednesday.

225
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:07,375
[grunts]

226
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:10,041
- [jar pops]
- [Mom exhales]

227
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:14,125
And I am so proud at how hard you work

228
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:18,166
to make sure that Halloween is safe
and fun for everyone in this town.

229
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,291
I'm sensin' a big "but" coming.

230
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:21,958
- But…
- Okay.

231
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:27,041
…this town is as full of bullies now
as it ever was in the 1600s.

232
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:30,791
You have to learn
to stand up for yourself.

233
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,458
I just get scared.

234
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:35,625
I know you do.

235
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:37,083
We all get scared.

236
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:42,458
But this year, you're gonna have to
find that bravery that's deep within you.

237
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:43,625
It's time.

238
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:55,916
{\an8}Ah, the good old days.

239
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:59,958
When the town toughs
only used to throw crab apples.

240
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:08,125
Ah, Officer Steve.
You always had it going on.

241
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:12,458
{\an8}"Most likely to marry his pillow."
Still don't get that one.

242
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:19,166
{\an8}"Most friendly."

243
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,833
"Most popular."

244
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:22,583
"Best looking."

245
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:24,500
The high school hat trick.

246
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:27,166
Could not have happened to a nicer woman.

247
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:35,541
Maybe if I wasn't such
a scaredy-cat like mom was sayin',

248
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:37,875
I would have asked you out.

249
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:42,333
And the cutest couple
would have been Violet and Hubie.

250
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:45,291
- [pounding]
- [screams]

251
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:47,750
Monster! [screams]

252
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,291
[Mom] Hubie, what was that?

253
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,833
Sorry, Mom! I'll clean that up!

254
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:58,166
[Mom] Did you make a messy?

255
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,583
[Hubie] I said I would clean it up!
It's not a big deal!

256
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:05,666
[Mom] What are you cleaning up?
Did you have an accident?

257
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:08,000
[Hubie] No! It wasn't an accident.

258
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:09,750
[Mom] It was on purpose?

259
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:10,708
[Hubie] Mom!

260
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:21,208
[trickling]

261
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:29,833
[Violet] Okay, kids,
you can't have candy for breakfast,

262
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:32,083
but you can sprinkle some
on top of your cereal.

263
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:33,458
- [girl 1] Yes!
- [girl 2] Oh, yeah!

264
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:37,000
[segment intro music playing]

265
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:39,500
<i>Welcome back.</i>
<i>You're Watching </i>Wake Up Boston.

266
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:43,250
And it's October 31st,
which is a special day across the country,

267
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:48,041
but most especially in Salem,
America's unofficial Halloween capital.

268
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:51,333
And it's gonna be a great day in Salem.
Right, Jenna Thomas?

269
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:54,708
Yes, Erin.
Clear and a balmy 61 degrees.

270
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:57,666
<i>Ready for trick-or-treating
and all the spooky stuff.</i>

271
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,125

272
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:04,250
<i>And now, </i>Wake Up Boston's<i> Tracy Phillips</i>

273
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:07,708
<i>David Benson, and...
Tracy, you went with Harley Quinn, too?</i>

274
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:09,166
<i>Sure did, Erin.</i>

275
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:12,791
<i>Only one day a year

276
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,125
<i>Hey!</i>

277
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:15,833
<i>You know it. Ooh! Ooh!</i>

278
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:17,500
<i>- Ooh! Ooh!
- Yeah!</i>

279
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:20,291
<i>So, Mayor Benson,
the sun sets in eight short hours,</i>

280
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:23,958
<i>but the spooky preparations
are in full swing around here.</i>

281
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:25,291
<i>Indeed it is, Tracy.</i>

282
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:29,625
<i>As you can see, we're already setting up
our world-famous Halloween parade.</i>

283
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:32,583
<i>And a few blocks over,
we got a street fair.</i>

284
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:35,833
<i>And you're expecting some pretty
impressive crowds here this evening.</i>

285
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:39,708
<i>Oh, we're expecting over 70,000 people
to visit Salem this evening.</i>

286
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:45,125
<i>Well, I know where I'm gonna be tonight.
Reporting from Salem, Tracy Phillips.</i>

287
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:46,875
<i>- Back to you, Erin.</i>
- [marching band playing]

288
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:50,125
- [Steve] Is this the way you found him?
- [man] Yeah.

289
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:52,541
And I was gonna take poor Peanut

290
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:55,750
to the Halloween Carnival tonight
for the petting zoo.

291
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:58,875
But what kid would wanna pet
a pig that look like that?

292
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:02,083
Did you hear anything
or see anything unusual last night?

293
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:05,458
Well, I woke up
'cause the animals sounded agitated,

294
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:09,875
and then I heard poor Peanut
make a God-awful squeal.

295
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:11,958
[imitating squealing]

296
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,500
Squealin' like
he was callin' for his daddy!

297
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:16,083
You know what I think done it?

298
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:17,541
A werewolf.

299
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:21,583
Think you've been watching
too many scary movies, Louise.

300
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:25,250
And I think you've been eating
too many of your own boogers, Dan.

301
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:28,416
Oh, at least my mama
don't stink the toilet up so bad,

302
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,166
we gotta get rid of the shower curtain.

303
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:33,416
Oh, you gonna bring up
my mama in front of the police, huh?

304
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,916
Ain't nobody say nothin'
'bout your big-ass mama.

305
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,041
She come in the house
and broke all the furniture.

306
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:39,625
My mom wouldn't break up the furniture

307
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:42,916
if you hadn't bought that cheap Ikea stuff
and put it together with a butter knife!

308
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Well, if I had a real man, then I wouldn't
have to do it myself now, would I?

309
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:47,458
[Dan] Peanut's dead!

310
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:49,166
We gonna eat Peanut tonight!

311
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,333
[crowd chattering]

312
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:53,958
[man] Look at these nerds.

313
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:57,208
Unbelievable. You can say a lot
of things about me, I was never a nerd.

314
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,333
Hey, pimples!

315
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:01,875
Pubie!

316
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:04,125
Pubie? Uh, who's... who's Pubie?

317
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:06,875
You are, Pubie.
Landolfa called you that yesterday.

318
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:07,958
Hilarious.

319
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:11,125
Janitor, some drunk guy
dressed as Captain Underpants

320
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:13,083
just threw up in the jail exhibit.

321
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:16,333
That's my cue.
Call me if you get lonely, Violet.

322
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:17,750
Don't call me.

323
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:18,875
[groans]

324
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:21,000
Wasn't plannin' on it. Hey, Dot.

325
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:23,541
So, I saw there were
massive lines out front.

326
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:27,208
I took the liberty to print up
some happy Halloween word searches.

327
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:28,541
You can pass it out to the kids.

328
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:30,458
Give them something to do
while they're waiting.

329
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:31,750
Oh, Hubie, how lovely.

330
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:33,375
Thank you so much.

331
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:34,291
Of course.

332
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,583
So, Violet Valentine.

333
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:42,333
Good to see you. Happy Halloween.

334
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:44,250
- Thank you.
- What brings you here?

335
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:46,458
I am chaperoning my daughter's field trip.

336
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,083
She's over there. Danielle! Danielle!

337
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:50,416
Say hello to Hubie.

338
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:52,750
Hi, Hubie. What school do you go to?

No. He's a grown man.
I've known him since kindergarten.

Yes.
We had Miss Colestice's class together.

- Yes, we did.
- You were the first kid to get earrings.

That's important.

but she spoke out.

00:40:54,833 --> 00:40:58,666
- Let's kill him!
- [all clamoring] Yeah! Yeah!

850
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:00,291
Hang on! All right.

851
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:04,125
I realize I might have gone too far
for your teenage mental capacities

852
00:41:04,208 --> 00:41:05,833
<i>and that is a boner on my part.</i>

853
00:41:06,333 --> 00:41:07,541
[all laughing]

854
00:41:07,625 --> 00:41:10,250
- I don't think he knows what boner means.
- No, definitely not.

855
00:41:10,333 --> 00:41:12,666
When I was your age,
I made some huge boners.

856
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:14,583
[all laughing]

857
00:41:14,666 --> 00:41:16,666
Boners that I wish I could get back now.

858
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:17,625
[all laughing]

859
00:41:17,708 --> 00:41:19,541
Listen, give me a minute head start,

860
00:41:19,625 --> 00:41:21,791
then tell him there's a kid
stuck in the corn maze.

861
00:41:21,875 --> 00:41:23,458
And why am I doing that?

862
00:41:23,541 --> 00:41:27,000
'Cause I am going to scare
the living crap out of him.

863
00:41:27,083 --> 00:41:28,500
Really? Does he scare easy?

864
00:41:30,208 --> 00:41:31,708
[screams] Oh my…

865
00:41:31,791 --> 00:41:34,291
[screaming] Ah! Oh!

866
00:41:34,375 --> 00:41:36,791
- [screams]
- [screaming]

867
00:41:36,875 --> 00:41:38,333
Yes.

868
00:41:38,416 --> 00:41:39,625
Yes, he does.

869
00:41:39,708 --> 00:41:41,125
[dance music continues playing]

870
00:41:41,208 --> 00:41:43,458
[Hubie] Actually, I had a good time
with you guys after all.

871
00:41:43,541 --> 00:41:47,083
It was fun. Hope we do it again next year.
Give a hoot, don't pollute.

872
00:41:47,166 --> 00:41:50,125
- [coughs] Isn't that Woodsy the Owl?
- No, he was Tootsie Pops.

873
00:41:50,208 --> 00:41:51,166
Hey, Mr. Pubois.

874
00:41:51,708 --> 00:41:52,875
- Dubois.
- Dubois.

875
00:41:53,458 --> 00:41:55,541
I think I saw a little kid
get lost in the Corn Maze.

876
00:41:55,625 --> 00:41:56,625
In the what?

877
00:41:57,291 --> 00:41:59,500
I heard him scream, "Help!"
Then he started crying.

878
00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:01,208
My God, it's just...
It's just a little kid!

879
00:42:01,291 --> 00:42:02,750
Okay. Handle your high.

880
00:42:02,833 --> 00:42:05,750
I am a member of the AUU.
This is what I was trained to do.

881
00:42:06,291 --> 00:42:07,291
[yells] Hoo-ah!

882
00:42:09,166 --> 00:42:12,000
[wheezing, grunting]

883
00:42:14,208 --> 00:42:15,583
I think we're good!

884
00:42:15,666 --> 00:42:17,541
[all laughing]

885
00:42:17,625 --> 00:42:20,750
Messing with Shoobie Dubois.
A Salem tradition.

886
00:42:21,333 --> 00:42:23,291
My grandma gave him
his first titty-twister.

887
00:42:23,375 --> 00:42:25,333
[all laughing]

888
00:42:25,416 --> 00:42:28,041
- What a bunch of jerks.
- Should we go tell him it's a prank?

889
00:42:28,833 --> 00:42:30,791
I knew I liked you, freshman. Come on.

890
00:42:31,666 --> 00:42:34,125
Excuse me, excuse me,
Bride of Skankenstein. Yeah, thank you.

891
00:42:53,041 --> 00:42:57,750
If you can hear me, please call out
so I can determine your whereabouts!

892
00:42:58,833 --> 00:43:00,583
Do not be fearful, little one!

893
00:43:01,125 --> 00:43:02,041
Announce yourself!

894
00:43:04,083 --> 00:43:05,291
[girl] Hubie!

895
00:43:05,375 --> 00:43:06,541
[Tommy] Mr. Dubois!

896
00:43:07,166 --> 00:43:08,083
[girl] Hubie!

897
00:43:08,875 --> 00:43:09,916
[Tommy] Hello!

898
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,750
- Where are you?
- Should we split up?

899
00:43:12,291 --> 00:43:14,166
I don't know.
That sounds like a big boner.

900
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:15,416
- What?
- I'm just kidding.

901
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:17,791
- [girl] Yeah, go that way…
- [heavy breathing]

902
00:43:17,875 --> 00:43:20,541
[Hubie] Is anyone out there? Sound off!

903
00:43:20,625 --> 00:43:23,875
Tonight's temperatures
will dip below 28 degrees!

904
00:43:23,958 --> 00:43:26,333
Your nervous system cannot handle that!

905
00:43:26,416 --> 00:43:28,125
Sasquatch could not handle that!

906
00:43:29,083 --> 00:43:31,500
[girl] Mr. Dubois? Hello!

907
00:43:34,041 --> 00:43:35,791
Hey, Tommy, hey!

908
00:43:39,583 --> 00:43:41,541
- Mr. Dubois! [screams]
- [laughs]

909
00:43:41,625 --> 00:43:44,000
What the hell, Mike?
Why would you do that?

910
00:43:44,083 --> 00:43:46,916
Hey, whoa! I'm sorry.
Come on, I couldn't resist.

911
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,250
[Tommy] That wasn't cool, man.

912
00:43:48,625 --> 00:43:49,875
Hey, coffee boy.

913
00:43:49,958 --> 00:43:51,375
You're that freshman, right?

914
00:43:52,166 --> 00:43:53,958
Uh, yeah.

915
00:43:54,041 --> 00:43:56,625
Yeah, well, welcome
to your first high school fight.

916
00:43:56,708 --> 00:43:57,625
[grunts]

917
00:43:58,208 --> 00:43:59,375
[girl] Tommy!

918
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:03,458
Megan McNally, you like underclassmen?

919
00:44:04,583 --> 00:44:06,041
Oh, that's adorable.

920
00:44:06,125 --> 00:44:06,958
[Hubie] Hello!

921
00:44:09,583 --> 00:44:11,083
Is the fight over? Did I win?

922
00:44:11,666 --> 00:44:13,666
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, you kicked his ass.
Come on.

923
00:44:14,791 --> 00:44:17,750
[Hubie] Is anyone out there? Sound off!

924
00:44:17,833 --> 00:44:19,333
[high-pitched voice] Help!

925
00:44:20,666 --> 00:44:24,041
Remain in place! I will find you!

926
00:44:24,666 --> 00:44:27,583
Not if I find you first! [snickers]

927
00:44:27,666 --> 00:44:31,708
Take me, evil one!
Just do not harm the child!

928
00:44:31,791 --> 00:44:33,333
[high-pitched voice] Help, Hubie!

929
00:44:33,416 --> 00:44:36,000
[snickering]

930
00:44:37,375 --> 00:44:38,875
No!

931
00:44:40,083 --> 00:44:41,666
Dad? Is that you?

932
00:44:42,791 --> 00:44:44,458
Does Mom know you're still alive?

933
00:44:45,833 --> 00:44:47,083
Are you still mad at me?

934
00:44:47,166 --> 00:44:49,750
No. It's Tommy, Violet Valentine's son.

935
00:44:49,833 --> 00:44:51,875
Yeah, and Megan.
I work down at the coffee shop.

936
00:44:51,958 --> 00:44:54,583
I give you free hot water
for your dehydrated soup sometimes.

937
00:44:54,666 --> 00:44:56,416
Yes. Much appreciated.

938
00:44:56,500 --> 00:45:00,250
The reason I take it for free
is 'cause I don't have money.

939
00:45:00,333 --> 00:45:03,791
Anyway, we came over here
to tell you that there's no lost kid.

940
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:05,416
No one's lost?

941
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:07,708
Yeah, it's just Mike Mundi
trying to pull a prank on you.

942
00:45:08,583 --> 00:45:09,791
Prank? No, I knew that.

943
00:45:11,916 --> 00:45:13,125
So, I like the costumes.

944
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,083
- Garbage can?
- Yeah. Tin Man.

945
00:45:16,166 --> 00:45:17,916
And Red Riding Hood.

946
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,958
I want to be honest with you.
Might not be a good year for it.

947
00:45:21,041 --> 00:45:24,875
Um, between us,
there is a man-wolf on the loose.

948
00:45:25,458 --> 00:45:28,333
Then maybe should I head inside?

949
00:45:28,416 --> 00:45:29,416
A wise decision.

950
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:32,041
By the way,
my mom was talking about you tonight.

951
00:45:32,625 --> 00:45:34,041
Your mom was talking about me?

952
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:35,541
What'd she say?

953
00:45:35,625 --> 00:45:37,208
Just that you are nice.

954
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:38,833
Well, I am nice.

955
00:45:39,333 --> 00:45:41,958
Because I'm not gonna tell her
that you're out here playing Romeo

956
00:45:42,041 --> 00:45:44,208
instead of watching
your two little sisters.

957
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,208
- Well, now I feel bad.
- I know you feel bad.

958
00:45:47,291 --> 00:45:49,625
- 'Cause you got a big heart.
- Thanks.

959
00:45:49,708 --> 00:45:51,666
So, I'm gonna let
you two guys take off without me.

960
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:53,666
I'll give you a head start
in the name of romance.

961
00:45:54,250 --> 00:45:56,791
- Okay. Go ahead, guys. Take care, now.
- [Tommy] Thanks, Mr. Dubois.

962
00:45:56,875 --> 00:45:58,833
- [Megan] Happy Halloween.
- Not looking, guys!

963
00:46:08,833 --> 00:46:10,583
Same corn over and over.

964
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,583
I should've left with the others,
'cause I have no idea where I am.

965
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:19,333
So, I came from there.
I already was there.

966
00:46:21,708 --> 00:46:24,208
Can't believe I don't have
a compass on my thermos.

Michael Mundi.

970
00:46:38,375 --> 00:46:39,541
[muffled screaming] Help me!

971
00:46:39,625 --> 00:46:45,041
Listen, I am a fan of a Halloween zinger
as much as the next guy, but…

972
00:46:45,125 --> 00:46:46,250
[grunting]

973
00:46:46,333 --> 00:46:47,416
What? What'd you say?

974
00:46:52,291 --> 00:46:54,000
Michael? Michael!

975
00:46:57,541 --> 00:46:58,375
What the...

976
00:47:07,875 --> 00:47:14,875

<i>the fun stops for all of us.</i>

981
00:47:27,166 --> 00:47:30,416
- Hubie, I can't do this.
- Michael Mundi was abducted.

982
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:32,458
I found a ticket
to the drive-in at the scene.

983
00:47:32,541 --> 00:47:33,583

We're falling behind out there.

990
00:47:50,041 --> 00:47:53,541
Well, I was on the phone
with the credit card company.

991
00:47:53,625 --> 00:47:56,750
They didn't know I had an extension.
I'm so sorry, Mr. Tayback.

992
00:47:56,833 --> 00:47:59,250
You know how much
credit card debt I'm in right now?

Yeah, you just missed the best part!

They're men's fingers.
Are you saying I have men's fingers?

1019
00:49:08,541 --> 00:49:10,916
Okay, look, I was just
trying something, okay?

1020
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,916
- Something different.
- Jeez, man.

1021
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,375
[sighs] Remember we used to
come here in high school?

1022
00:49:15,458 --> 00:49:19,708
Mm-hmm. Feels exactly the same, too.
We got Hubie Dubois spying on everybody.

1023
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:23,875
I gotta say, it's pretty impressive
how long he's been a loser.

1024
00:49:24,375 --> 00:49:26,416
- I got a great idea.
- [woman on-screen screaming]

1025
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:29,750
It's kinda evil, but stick with me.

1026
00:49:29,833 --> 00:49:31,666
Now, that turns me on.

1027
00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:36,083
[both laughing]

1028
00:49:39,041 --> 00:49:40,041
Michael Mundi.

1029
00:49:40,125 --> 00:49:41,833
[clicking pen]

1030
00:49:41,916 --> 00:49:44,333
Scheduled to come to
the Creature Double Feature.

1031
00:49:45,333 --> 00:49:46,541
To meet who?

1032
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,916
To kill his next victim?

1033
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,875
- [woman] Hubie.
- [screaming] Murder!

1034
00:49:53,916 --> 00:49:55,041
You okay, big man?

1035
00:49:55,125 --> 00:49:56,000
Mrs. Hennessy.

1036
00:49:58,666 --> 00:50:02,208
I am actually doing
a follow-up on a classified situation.

1037
00:50:02,291 --> 00:50:04,166
Did you lose your thermos or some shit?

1038
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:06,083
Oh, that'll never happen.

1039
00:50:06,541 --> 00:50:07,583
[clicking]

1040
00:50:11,083 --> 00:50:14,000
Anyway, I saw something earlier.

1041
00:50:14,083 --> 00:50:14,916
Mm-hmm.

1042
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,916
Something suspicious.

1043
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:20,166
Ears are in open position.

1044
00:50:21,333 --> 00:50:22,833
This is gonna sound nuts.

1045
00:50:22,916 --> 00:50:25,291
But I was going to get popcorn earlier,

1046
00:50:25,375 --> 00:50:30,208
when this freaky
old-timey car pulled into the lot.

1047
00:50:30,833 --> 00:50:32,541
And the driver was...

1048
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:35,500
You just gotta see it to believe it.

1049
00:50:36,875 --> 00:50:40,791
Could you possibly point me
in the direction of this strange vehicle?

1050
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:42,583
It's that one.

1051
00:50:43,458 --> 00:50:44,291
Right there.

1052
00:50:46,750 --> 00:50:47,583
Okay.

1053
00:50:51,416 --> 00:50:52,333
Let's take a look.

1054
00:50:55,291 --> 00:50:56,541
- Oh, and, uh…
- Yes?

1055
00:50:57,375 --> 00:51:00,208
Hubie, do be… careful.

1056
00:51:00,666 --> 00:51:02,916
[man on-screen shouting]

1057
00:51:18,541 --> 00:51:20,416
[car starts]

1058
00:51:27,875 --> 00:51:29,208
{\an8}What the what?

1059
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,041
Okay, whoa, there.

1060
00:51:33,958 --> 00:51:35,375
Step out of the vehicle!

1061
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:40,375
We can do this the easy way
or the paddle way. It's up to you.

1062
00:51:41,291 --> 00:51:42,458
[engine revs]

1063
00:51:46,375 --> 00:51:47,416
Ghost!

1064
00:51:48,375 --> 00:51:50,541
[Hubie screaming]

1065
00:51:50,625 --> 00:51:51,875
Help me!

1066
00:51:52,333 --> 00:51:53,416
[screaming, muttering]

1067
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:54,500
What are you?

1068
00:51:54,583 --> 00:51:55,916
[whimpering]

1069
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:56,833
Help me!

1070
00:51:57,791 --> 00:51:58,875
[screaming]

1071
00:51:58,958 --> 00:52:00,708
No! Oh, God!

1072
00:52:00,791 --> 00:52:01,666
Why?

1073
00:52:01,750 --> 00:52:04,583
[kids shouting, clamoring] Get him!

1074
00:52:04,666 --> 00:52:05,916
What the heck?

1075
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
[laughing]

1076
00:52:07,083 --> 00:52:09,541
[kids continue shouting]

1077
00:52:09,625 --> 00:52:10,541
[Hubie screams]

1078
00:52:12,416 --> 00:52:13,416
[Hubie mutters]

1079
00:52:15,958 --> 00:52:17,000
[screaming]

1080
00:52:17,083 --> 00:52:18,416
[grunts] Help me!

1081
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:19,333
[thuds]

1082
00:52:19,416 --> 00:52:23,416
[laughing]

1083
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:25,375
- Now do you want me?
- [Mrs. Hennessy] No!

1084
00:52:25,458 --> 00:52:27,375
[laughing, crying]

1085
00:52:27,833 --> 00:52:30,333
[Hubie]
There's a time and a place for hijinks!

1086
00:52:30,958 --> 00:52:33,333
But there's a situation going on here!

1087
00:52:33,416 --> 00:52:34,791
[rustling]

1088
00:52:34,875 --> 00:52:36,500
- [growls]
- [screams]

1089
00:52:38,916 --> 00:52:41,500
Hubie. It's funny seeing you here.

1090
00:52:41,583 --> 00:52:42,666
[chuckling]

1091
00:52:42,750 --> 00:52:44,833
I'm sorry about before. In the basement.

1092
00:52:45,583 --> 00:52:47,250
I really wasn't feeling myself.

1093
00:52:47,333 --> 00:52:49,375
I don't know
if I like you much better now.

1094
00:52:49,458 --> 00:52:52,041
You didn't tell anybody about that,
did you, Hubie?

1095
00:52:52,125 --> 00:52:54,375
Why? You have secrets, Mr. Lambert?

1096
00:52:54,958 --> 00:52:58,666
As in, secretly dropping by
the corn maze earlier tonight?

1097
00:52:58,750 --> 00:52:59,625
Did anybody get...

1098
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:01,583
[panting, heaving]

1099
00:53:01,666 --> 00:53:03,625
- Mr. Lambert.
- Walter.

1100
00:53:03,708 --> 00:53:07,250
Your tombstone says
that you have yet to die.

1101
00:53:07,333 --> 00:53:11,625
Are you a human being,
or are you a moon-crazed beast

1102
00:53:12,208 --> 00:53:16,833
from beyond the grave, grave, grave?

1103
00:53:17,166 --> 00:53:20,708
[snarling, howling]

1104
00:53:20,791 --> 00:53:23,291
Hold that thought! I gotta split!

1105
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:24,916
Mr. Lambert!

1106
00:53:26,166 --> 00:53:27,833
That just answered my question.

1107
00:53:28,541 --> 00:53:33,750
[crowd cheering, clamoring]

1108
00:53:33,833 --> 00:53:36,041
[male announcer]
Oh, man. That's another one.

1109
00:53:36,125 --> 00:53:37,333
[marching band playing fanfare]

1110
00:53:37,416 --> 00:53:40,750
What a man!
What a mouth! And on his first try.

1111
00:53:40,833 --> 00:53:43,083
Have a round of applause, everyone.

1112
00:53:43,166 --> 00:53:44,458
Who's next?

1113
00:53:44,541 --> 00:53:46,291
If the mayor can do it, so can you.

1114
00:53:46,875 --> 00:53:48,166
You, sir! Step on up.

1115
00:53:52,791 --> 00:53:54,958
Sorry to bother you,
mayor, but it's important.

1116
00:53:55,041 --> 00:53:56,458
[muffled muttering]

1117
00:53:57,958 --> 00:53:59,250
[gasps]

1118
00:54:01,083 --> 00:54:02,125
What is it, Sergeant?

1119
00:54:02,208 --> 00:54:03,916
About an hour ago,
I got a strange report

1120
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,875
of a missing high school kid
from Hubie Dubois.

1121
00:54:06,375 --> 00:54:09,458
After I laughed it off as usual,
I got a call from the kid's mother.

1122
00:54:09,541 --> 00:54:10,750
He actually never made it home.

1123
00:54:10,833 --> 00:54:13,583
This Richard Hartman thing
has got you jumpy as hell.

1124
00:54:13,666 --> 00:54:16,375
I suggest we cancel
the fireworks show immediately.

1125
00:54:16,458 --> 00:54:18,791
We ain't canceling
a damn thing, Sergeant.

1126
00:54:18,875 --> 00:54:20,083
We got an unsolved mystery!

1127
00:54:20,166 --> 00:54:23,041
Eighty-five percent of the tourism dollars
spent in this town

1128
00:54:23,125 --> 00:54:24,500
are spent on Halloween night.

1129
00:54:24,583 --> 00:54:28,625
And I'm not gonna let no
high school peckerhead jeopardize that.

1130
00:54:28,708 --> 00:54:31,541
- I just think that...
- Trick-or-treat, smell my feet.

1131
00:54:31,625 --> 00:54:34,291
- I just think that you're not...
- Smell my feet.

1132
00:54:34,375 --> 00:54:37,250
- I just think that...
- Smell my feet.

1133
00:54:37,333 --> 00:54:38,625
[marching band continues playing]

1134
00:54:38,708 --> 00:54:40,083
You really want me to smell them?

1135
00:54:41,625 --> 00:54:43,416
[owl hooting]

1136
00:54:44,958 --> 00:54:46,125
[dog barking in distance]

[distant howling]

1138
00:54:50,125 --> 00:54:51,500
Let's just go back, Danielle.

1139
00:54:51,583 --> 00:54:55,000
I don't want Mom to get home
and see that Tommy left us by ourselves.

1140
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:57,166
I think we'll all get in
really big trouble for that.

1141
00:54:57,250 --> 00:54:58,875
Are we even going the right way?

1142
00:55:03,166 --> 00:55:04,083
Excuse me, sir?

1143
00:55:05,208 --> 00:55:07,375
Do you know
the quickest way to Wallace Orchard?

1144
00:55:13,875 --> 00:55:16,708
<i>- ♪ It was Halloween night at the castle… ♪</i>
- Hey, handsome. Soup's ready.

1145
00:55:16,791 --> 00:55:20,583
One clam,
one chicken noodle, and one split pea.

1146
00:55:21,083 --> 00:55:23,875
So, you seem a little stressed.
I mean, what can I do to help ya out?

1147
00:55:23,958 --> 00:55:25,458
Maybe a glass of Chardonnay?

1148
00:55:25,541 --> 00:55:28,166
Well, to be honest with ya,
I don't drink beer.

1149
00:55:28,250 --> 00:55:30,333
But do you have any silver bullets?

1150
00:55:30,416 --> 00:55:32,875
That is not on the menu tonight.

1151
00:55:32,958 --> 00:55:36,708
But I happen to be an excellent listener
if you want to, you know,

1152
00:55:37,333 --> 00:55:38,500
share anything with me.

1153
00:55:39,333 --> 00:55:40,166
Okay.

1154
00:55:41,458 --> 00:55:42,625
We all have a purpose.

1155
00:55:43,291 --> 00:55:45,958
Some people's purpose is to
make sure all the streets are clean.

1156
00:55:46,041 --> 00:55:47,083
Some people's purpose,

1157
00:55:47,166 --> 00:55:49,958
like Kenny Rogers', is to make sure
there's great tunes on the radio

1158
00:55:50,041 --> 00:55:52,166
that we can all
sing along with on road trips.

1159
00:55:52,250 --> 00:55:54,083
Some people's purpose, like you,

1160
00:55:54,166 --> 00:55:57,875
are here to make sure that kids
without parents end up with a mom anyways.

1161
00:55:57,958 --> 00:56:00,875
Who is nice and kind to 'em
and makes them feel loved.

1162
00:56:00,958 --> 00:56:03,041
- You happen to have any A1 Sauce?
- Yeah.

1163
00:56:03,833 --> 00:56:04,708
My whole life,

1164
00:56:04,791 --> 00:56:07,375
I felt my purpose
was to make sure everybody

1165
00:56:07,458 --> 00:56:09,541
was safe and sound on Halloween.

1166
00:56:09,625 --> 00:56:12,083
But tonight, I have failed massively.

1167

[thermos whirring]

1168
00:56:13,250 --> 00:56:17,333
Because a fine young man
was abducted under my watch.

1169
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:19,625
- That's on me.
- No.

1170
00:56:19,708 --> 00:56:20,708
Mmm.

[turns thermos off]

1172
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:23,791
How can I help you?

1173
00:56:25,875 --> 00:56:28,333
You just did help me
by listening to my story.

1174
00:56:30,291 --> 00:56:31,375
Be careful today.

1175
00:56:32,291 --> 00:56:33,416
Danger is afoot.

1176
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:36,708
Oh, well, I don't worry about me.
I worry about my kids.

1177
00:56:36,791 --> 00:56:39,166
Called home. None of 'em picked up.

1178
00:56:39,250 --> 00:56:41,875
They're probably just
watching a movie, though, and…

1179
00:56:41,958 --> 00:56:44,000
- Tommy's keeping an eye on them.
- Tommy?

1180
00:56:44,083 --> 00:56:46,500
I'm sure he's been there the whole time.
Without a doubt.

1181
00:56:47,125 --> 00:56:49,750
The night is young.
Appreciate you being nice to me.

1182
00:56:49,833 --> 00:56:51,250
Of course, Hubie.

1183
00:56:51,875 --> 00:56:53,375
You're the best person I know.

1184
00:56:53,916 --> 00:56:57,333
You're always thinking of
everyone else and never of yourself.

1185
00:56:57,958 --> 00:56:59,833
But I guess that's why you're a hero.

[giggles]

1187
00:57:06,583 --> 00:57:11,458
Did you see how scared Scooby was
when that car started moving? [laughing]

- With his ping-pong paddle at the ready!
- Oh, my God!

1189
00:57:14,291 --> 00:57:15,958
What a buffoon!

1190
00:57:16,041 --> 00:57:19,041

Mr. Hennessy! Mr. Hennessy!

[tires screech]

1193
00:57:23,625 --> 00:57:25,083
There's somebody in the road.

1194
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:29,333
- Who the hell is that?
- It's not moving.

1195
00:57:29,416 --> 00:57:30,791
Looks like a dummy.

1196
00:57:30,875 --> 00:57:33,208
You look like a dummy.
Go out and get it out of the way.

1197
00:57:34,375 --> 00:57:35,208
Okay.

1198
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:38,708
[puffs, inhales]

1199
00:57:38,791 --> 00:57:40,416
Now, see, that does it for me.

1200
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:41,375
You like that?

1201
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:42,833
No.

1202
00:57:45,250 --> 00:57:49,541
[open door alert dinging]

1203
00:58:00,375 --> 00:58:02,458
[text keys tapping]

1204
00:58:19,291 --> 00:58:20,208
Scarecrow?

1205
00:58:21,958 --> 00:58:23,041
[Mr. Hennessy screams]

1206
00:58:28,958 --> 00:58:29,791
Lester!

1207
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:37,333
Lester!

1208
00:58:39,791 --> 00:58:41,875
I'm gonna kick your ass for this, Lester.

1209
00:58:45,125 --> 00:58:47,666
I swear to God,
if you jump out of one of these bushes,

1210
00:58:47,750 --> 00:58:49,416
I'm gonna punch you in the face!

1211
00:58:57,291 --> 00:58:58,125
What the...

1212
00:58:58,833 --> 00:58:59,666
Lester!

1213
00:58:59,750 --> 00:59:00,916
[panting]

1214
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:01,958
Where are you?

1215

[screaming]

1216
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:08,500
[grunting]

1217
00:59:09,541 --> 00:59:12,208
[Hubie]
Valentine family, where are you?

1218
00:59:12,958 --> 00:59:13,833
I'm coming!

1219
00:59:14,625 --> 00:59:16,416
Danielle! Cooky!

1220
00:59:17,833 --> 00:59:20,958
I say, "Marco." You say, "Polo." Marco!

1221
00:59:21,041 --> 00:59:21,875
[man 1] Weirdo!

1222
00:59:22,750 --> 00:59:23,791
Marco!

1223
00:59:23,875 --> 00:59:24,708
[man 2] Asshole!

1224
00:59:26,041 --> 00:59:28,333
[fire crackling]

1225
00:59:37,541 --> 00:59:41,541
[bare footsteps running]

1226
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:46,583
Hubie Dubois! Is that you?

1227
00:59:47,375 --> 00:59:50,041
[Walter] Oh! You must be Mrs. Dubois!

1228
00:59:50,541 --> 00:59:51,666
I'm Walter!

1229
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:54,416
Nice to meet you, Walter.

1230
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:56,750
It's a shame
what they've done to your lawn!

1231
00:59:57,583 --> 00:59:59,208
Happens every year!

1232
01:00:01,125 --> 01:00:02,000
[grunts]

1233

[handcuffs clicking]

1239
01:00:18,166 --> 01:00:19,583
Not tonight!

1240
01:00:20,291 --> 01:00:22,958
[gasping, grunting]

1241
01:00:23,708 --> 01:00:28,083

[sighs]

1243
01:00:40,875 --> 01:00:41,875
We need to talk.

1244
01:00:46,333 --> 01:00:47,458
[Tommy] They're not up here.

1245
01:00:48,208 --> 01:00:49,708
[Megan] They're not down here, either.

1246
01:00:50,541 --> 01:00:51,583
Danielle!

1247
01:00:51,666 --> 01:00:52,833
Cooky!

1248
01:00:52,916 --> 01:00:55,458
- We didn't find them.
- Hey! It's okay. We'll figure it out.

1249
01:00:55,541 --> 01:00:56,958
- We'll find them.
- [pounding at door]

1250
01:00:57,625 --> 01:00:58,458
[Tommy] Oh, no.

1251
01:00:58,833 --> 01:01:01,083
[doorknob rattling]

1252
01:01:04,166 --> 01:01:05,458
[creaking]

1253
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:13,416
[all screaming]

1254
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:14,500
What are we screaming at?

1255
01:01:14,583 --> 01:01:16,125
[Tommy and Megan sigh]

1256
01:01:16,208 --> 01:01:18,000
- Bam.
- Mr. Dubois, I screwed up.

1257
01:01:18,083 --> 01:01:20,708
- I can't find my sisters.
- You don't know where the kids are? Huh.

1258
01:01:21,375 --> 01:01:23,083
'Cause I do. They're right here.

1259
01:01:23,166 --> 01:01:25,041
- [girls] Tommy! Tommy!
- Oh, my God!

1260
01:01:25,125 --> 01:01:27,458
I'm so sorry I left guys.
I'm so glad you're okay.

1261
01:01:27,541 --> 01:01:29,625
You are so cute with them.

1262
01:01:29,708 --> 01:01:31,250
You have a girlfriend?

1263
01:01:31,958 --> 01:01:34,541
I saw 'em coming through
the Old McMillan shortcut.

1264
01:01:34,625 --> 01:01:37,125
It was funny, 'cause not many people
know where that shortcut is.

1265
01:01:37,208 --> 01:01:40,083
Just me and a friend of mine,
Richie Hartman. When I was a kid,

1266
01:01:40,166 --> 01:01:43,416
we used to finish our band practice
and shoot right through there.

1267
01:01:43,916 --> 01:01:46,541
- Well, at least everybody's safe.
- No one in Salem is safe tonight.

1268
01:01:46,625 --> 01:01:49,541
Do you understand me, Tommy? That's why
I'm putting this family on lockdown.

1269
01:01:49,625 --> 01:01:52,500
Now, Tommy, you call your mother.
Let her know you're home.

1270
01:01:52,583 --> 01:01:54,000
Megan, you call your parents.

1271
01:01:54,083 --> 01:01:56,333
Let them know you're staying
at a friend's. That's for you.

1272
01:01:56,416 --> 01:02:00,125
You two, do me a favor. Eat all the candy
you want, and then go straight to sleep.

1273
01:02:00,708 --> 01:02:03,875
And lock this door!
No matter what, don't answer it!

1274
01:02:03,958 --> 01:02:05,250
What're you gonna do, Mr. Dubois?

1275
01:02:05,333 --> 01:02:08,083
I'm gonna do what I do every October 31st.

1276
01:02:08,166 --> 01:02:11,708
Make sure every citizen
in this town is safe and protected.

1277
01:02:13,208 --> 01:02:16,875
Um, but do you have a bathroom
I could use? 'Cause I, uh…

1278
01:02:17,666 --> 01:02:19,125
The soup kinda went right through me.

1279
01:02:19,916 --> 01:02:21,333
Upstairs.

1280
01:02:21,416 --> 01:02:23,250
Toilet? Is it a big toilet?

1281
01:02:23,333 --> 01:02:25,458
'Cause I got a lot to do.

1282
01:02:27,958 --> 01:02:30,500
[howling in distance]

1283
01:02:32,416 --> 01:02:34,625
[barking, howling]

1284
01:02:35,750 --> 01:02:36,750
I know that howl.

1285
01:02:37,041 --> 01:02:38,625
[howling continues]

1286
01:02:38,708 --> 01:02:39,625
Walter Lambert!

[howling continues]

1292
01:02:56,958 --> 01:02:58,750
The transformation is complete.

1293
01:02:59,208 --> 01:03:00,333
[dog grunts]

1294
01:03:01,291 --> 01:03:05,416
While I understand that you are
now a mindless killing machine,

1295
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:10,875
I would like to speak with the human being
that is deep down below your fur.

1296
01:03:11,250 --> 01:03:12,458
[girl screaming in distance]

1297
01:03:12,541 --> 01:03:13,458
Mr. Lambert.

[dog grunts]

1299
01:03:14,583 --> 01:03:15,416
Walter.

1300
01:03:17,125 --> 01:03:21,458
I cannot, in good faith,
allow you to hurt another soul tonight,

1301
01:03:21,541 --> 01:03:24,791
even though this is Halloween,
and even though I know this is...

1302
01:03:26,083 --> 01:03:28,666
Mr. Lambert, you're better than that.

1303
01:03:28,750 --> 01:03:31,708
You... Did you really wanna
defecate in front of me, sir?

1304
01:03:32,916 --> 01:03:34,291
Oh, now, you're eating it!

1305
01:03:34,375 --> 01:03:36,750
Is that Michael Mundi
you're eating right now?

1306
01:03:36,833 --> 01:03:39,083
Is he inside your feces?

1307
01:03:39,166 --> 01:03:42,375
- [barking]
- Mr. Lambert! Get over here!

1308
01:03:42,458 --> 01:03:43,958

[hollering]

1313
01:03:54,250 --> 01:03:55,583
Yo, dawg! That's my bullet!

1314
01:03:55,666 --> 01:03:56,541
[Hubie] Come here!

01:03:57,708 --> 01:04:00,583
Oh! [panting, screaming]

1317
01:04:00,666 --> 01:04:01,500

Mr. Lambert.

1320

Mr. Lambert?

[moaning, crying]

1322
01:04:09,083 --> 01:04:10,541
Mr. Lambert.

1325
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:26,875
Mr. Lambert.

1326
01:04:27,750 --> 01:04:29,125
This is not your fault!

1327
01:04:30,041 --> 01:04:31,000
You are cursed!

1328
01:04:31,083 --> 01:04:31,958
Hello.

1329
01:04:32,833 --> 01:04:34,750
[screaming]

1330
01:04:34,833 --> 01:04:37,166
Mommy! No! Help me, Mommy!

1331
01:04:37,250 --> 01:04:39,833
Help me! Help me!

1332
01:04:39,916 --> 01:04:43,833
[sobbing, heaving]

1333
01:04:43,916 --> 01:04:45,875
- [man] And stay out!
- [women laughing]

1334
01:04:45,958 --> 01:04:49,291
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1335
01:04:49,375 --> 01:04:50,541
That was so terrifying!

1336
01:04:50,625 --> 01:04:52,958
- That was even crazier than last year!
- Yes!

1337
01:04:53,041 --> 01:04:55,500
- How much fun was that?
- That was so much fun. [laughing]

1338
01:04:55,583 --> 01:04:58,291
It almost made me forget
that I buried my father today.

1339
01:04:58,958 --> 01:05:00,083
Oh, I'm sorry.

1340
01:05:00,166 --> 01:05:04,291
No, it's a good thing.
I mean, not for him so much,

1341
01:05:04,375 --> 01:05:07,375
but it's given me
time to be introspective.

1342
01:05:07,833 --> 01:05:09,291
- That's good.
- I'm Pete Landolfa.

1343
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:10,541
Oh, I'm Chantal.

1344
01:05:10,625 --> 01:05:11,583
- Chantal?
- Yeah.

[spooky theremin music playing]

1346
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:18,833
Come to me.

1347
01:05:22,208 --> 01:05:24,083
Walter. Come!

1348
01:05:26,916 --> 01:05:27,750
Here, Walter.

[patting leg]

1350
01:05:33,333 --> 01:05:34,458
I don't wanna do this.

1351
01:05:34,958 --> 01:05:36,958
You've been a very good neighbor to me.

1352
01:05:37,041 --> 01:05:39,041
But what has to be done, has to be done.

1353
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:42,541
Right between…

1354
01:05:43,791 --> 01:05:44,708
The eyes!

1355
01:05:46,833 --> 01:05:49,041
Oh, no.

1356
01:05:49,125 --> 01:05:50,083
- [dog barks]
- No!

1357
01:05:50,166 --> 01:05:51,958
Homeboy. Are you okay, man?

1358
01:05:52,041 --> 01:05:55,000
[screaming hysterically]

1359
01:05:55,083 --> 01:05:56,000
- Dude.
- No!

1360
01:05:56,083 --> 01:05:58,625
This is not real. You get that, right?

1361
01:05:58,708 --> 01:06:01,083
We're just trying to
raise money for our school.

1362
01:06:01,166 --> 01:06:02,916
[continues screaming]

1363
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:03,958
Wait a second.

1364
01:06:04,958 --> 01:06:06,500
- Are you hittin' on me?
- [laughing]

1365
01:06:06,583 --> 01:06:08,583
Because if so, that is incredibly sick.

1366
01:06:08,666 --> 01:06:10,125
We're having a conversation.

1367
01:06:10,208 --> 01:06:12,916
Mm-mmm. 'Cause you're, like,
three times my age, okay?

1368
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:16,750
Thrice. I was born around the same time
you had your first heart bypass.

1369
01:06:16,833 --> 01:06:20,583
- [dog barks]
- Oh, Buster! Hey, my big boy.

1370
01:06:20,666 --> 01:06:24,500
Are you here to protect me from this
weirdo man that's trying to hit on me?

1371
01:06:24,583 --> 01:06:27,125
- [screaming hysterically]
- [growls]

1372
01:06:28,875 --> 01:06:31,500
[screaming] My eyes are on fire!

1373
01:06:31,583 --> 01:06:33,500
- Why would you mace me?
- Yo.

1374
01:06:33,583 --> 01:06:35,125
I'm a dentist. I help people!

1375
01:06:35,208 --> 01:06:37,708
Liar! Lucifer!

1376
01:06:37,791 --> 01:06:41,083
[laughing] That sounds like Hubie Dubois.

1377
01:06:41,166 --> 01:06:44,833
And since I struck out with you,
I'm gonna take it out on him.

1378
01:06:45,458 --> 01:06:46,708
Have fun with that.

1379
01:06:47,375 --> 01:06:49,458
[man laughing maniacally]

1380
01:06:51,041 --> 01:06:52,916
[panting]

1381
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:56,000
[maniacal laughter continues]

1382
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,666
[gasps] Oh! Oh!

1383
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:02,000
You gotta be... Whoa. [chuckles]

1384
01:07:03,166 --> 01:07:06,583
There's this goof headed his way.
Hubie Dubois.

1385
01:07:06,666 --> 01:07:09,541
When he gets here,
I'll handle the scaring.

1386
01:07:09,625 --> 01:07:11,750
You just sit back and enjoy. [snickers]

1387
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,458
[Hubie] Attention, haunted house patrons.

1388
01:07:15,541 --> 01:07:18,666
This is a direct order from the AUU.

1389
01:07:18,750 --> 01:07:21,583
Move quickly and quietly toward the exits.

1390
01:07:21,666 --> 01:07:23,708
The man-wolf has eaten his kryptonite!

1391
01:07:24,125 --> 01:07:25,125
Pubie!

1392
01:07:25,208 --> 01:07:27,291
[screaming]

1393
01:07:27,375 --> 01:07:28,291
[gasps] Huh?

1394
01:07:29,375 --> 01:07:31,208
Oh, my God. This is a travesty.

1395
01:07:31,291 --> 01:07:34,125
First, Mike Mundi. Now, Mr. Landolfa.

1396
01:07:34,833 --> 01:07:36,916
And why would God
do this to such good people?

1397
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:40,875
Good people?
All those two ever did was abuse you, man.

1398
01:07:40,958 --> 01:07:44,458
You know who should feel bad right now?
Our wonderful mayor.

1399
01:07:44,541 --> 01:07:45,791
I'm truly sorry.

1400
01:07:45,875 --> 01:07:48,625
You knew that high school kid
from the corn maze was missing.

1401
01:07:48,708 --> 01:07:51,291
- But you told nobody.
- Yeah. Bad for business, I guess.

1402
01:07:51,375 --> 01:07:55,166
Oh, they just found Lester Hennessy's car
abandoned in the middle of Whipstick Road.

1403
01:07:55,250 --> 01:07:58,125
- No sign of Lester or Mary.
- No!

1404
01:07:58,625 --> 01:08:00,000
So, we are cancelin' the fireworks

1405
01:08:00,083 --> 01:08:02,291
and all other related
Halloween activities.

1406
01:08:02,375 --> 01:08:04,250
- Officer Steve.
- Not now, Hubie.

1407
01:08:04,333 --> 01:08:07,291
- I think I know who did it.
- Oh, so do I.

1408
01:08:07,375 --> 01:08:08,458
His name…

1409
01:08:10,041 --> 01:08:11,375
Is Walter Lambert.

1410
01:08:11,958 --> 01:08:13,166
- Walter who?
- Lambert.

1411
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:17,083
Scientists would call him a lyco-thorpe.

1412
01:08:17,166 --> 01:08:18,750
I think he means a lycanthrope.

1413
01:08:18,833 --> 01:08:20,583
- Is that what it is?
- It's a werewolf.

1414
01:08:20,666 --> 01:08:22,375
- Okay.
- Hubie, I will lock you up.

1415
01:08:22,458 --> 01:08:25,041
- I got four people missing here.
- Officer Steve, listen to me.

1416
01:08:25,125 --> 01:08:28,375
I saw the man
destroy his home earlier today.

1417
01:08:28,458 --> 01:08:30,291
Then I saw him in the pumpkin patch.

1418
01:08:30,375 --> 01:08:33,791
His shirt was torn up.
He was barking at the moon.

1419
01:08:33,875 --> 01:08:35,458
His arms were very, very hairy.

1420
01:08:35,541 --> 01:08:40,583
Then I saw him at this haunted house,
his tail wagging in murderous glee.

1421
01:08:41,083 --> 01:08:44,708
- Wait, you talking about my dog, Buster.
- That was Walter Lambert!

1422
01:08:45,291 --> 01:08:46,291
Where does he live?

1423
01:08:46,375 --> 01:08:48,333
Fifty-Nine Elm Street. Check on it.

1424
01:08:48,416 --> 01:08:50,208
- There's your killer.
- [man on phone] <i>Salem PD.</i>

1425
01:08:50,291 --> 01:08:52,208
Blake, I need you to go out to 59 Elm.

1426
01:08:52,291 --> 01:08:55,083
There should be a guy there.
New in town. Possibly shirtless.

1427
01:08:55,166 --> 01:08:58,333
Yeah. Middle-aged,
growls a lot, glue-on hairy hands?

1428
01:08:58,416 --> 01:09:00,958
<i>Yeah, I got him right here.
Him and your boy, Richie Hartman.</i>

1429
01:09:01,041 --> 01:09:04,000
They both came by and turned themselves
in, like, 45 minutes ago.

1430
01:09:04,083 --> 01:09:05,083
Together?

1431
01:09:05,166 --> 01:09:08,916
Yeah. Apparently, Lambert is
Hartman's roommate at the mental hospital.

1432
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:12,250
Sorry. Werewolf Treatment Center.

1433
01:09:12,333 --> 01:09:15,583
Lambert broke out about a month ago,
and then Hartman broke out yesterday

1434
01:09:15,666 --> 01:09:17,916
to try to find him
and convince him to come back.

1435
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,541
It's actually pretty sweet, isn't it?

1436
01:09:19,625 --> 01:09:21,833
So, you've had eyes
on them for 45 minutes?

1437
01:09:21,916 --> 01:09:23,375
[Blake] <i>Almost, like, an hour now.</i>

1438
01:09:23,458 --> 01:09:26,916
And also, Lambert's real name is
Nick Hudson. Yeah. Walter Lambert

1439
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,625
is just some name that he got off
a tombstone on his way into town.

1440
01:09:29,708 --> 01:09:31,791
All right, Blake. I got it. Thank you.

1441
01:09:31,875 --> 01:09:35,541
I feel bad you got yourself
in even more trouble just to save me.

1442
01:09:35,625 --> 01:09:38,291
No, it was good
to get out of that place for a while.

1443
01:09:38,375 --> 01:09:41,416
- You did me a favor. Thank you.
- Did you do anything fun?

1444
01:09:42,083 --> 01:09:45,000
I pissed on a tombstone,
pissed on the street.

1445
01:09:45,083 --> 01:09:47,458
Just some fun pissing stuff, you know.

1446
01:09:47,541 --> 01:09:50,375
- Nobody pees more than you.
- I'm peein' now.

1447
01:09:50,458 --> 01:09:53,541
[both laughing]

1448
01:09:56,958 --> 01:10:01,083
- That's a good roommate. Yes. [chuckles]
- [sniffing, panting]

1449
01:10:01,166 --> 01:10:02,833
- Who's a good roommate? Yes. Yes.
- [barking]

1450
01:10:02,916 --> 01:10:04,291
[Hartman chuckling] Yes, you are.

1451
01:10:06,083 --> 01:10:10,375
Lambert and Hartman have been in custody
during the whole Landolfa disappearance.

1452
01:10:10,458 --> 01:10:11,916
So, it couldn't have been them.

1453
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:15,083
- [dog whimpers]
- Buster, my baby!

1454
01:10:15,166 --> 01:10:18,333
Oh, by the way, he ate a silver bullet
if you wanna check his feces tomorrow.

1455
01:10:18,416 --> 01:10:19,666
I ain't doin' that.

1456
01:10:20,458 --> 01:10:22,916
Then who? Are there any clues?

1457
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:26,708
Landolfa did go back
into the haunted house to look for Hubie.

1458
01:10:26,791 --> 01:10:31,375
Yeah. Hubie seems to be around
a lot of people before they go missing.

1459
01:10:32,791 --> 01:10:35,833
- People who have messed with him.
- Did the Hennesseys mess with Hubie, too?

1460
01:10:36,416 --> 01:10:37,541
Oh, they live for it.

1461
01:10:37,625 --> 01:10:41,208
So, it was payback time. Wasn't it, Hubie?

1462
01:10:41,291 --> 01:10:44,291
No, I would never hurt anybody. I...

1463
01:10:44,375 --> 01:10:45,666
You got the wrong guy.

1464
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,166
- Father Dave.
- Have you been planning this all along?

1465
01:10:49,875 --> 01:10:52,250
- [snarling]
- You sick man.

1466
01:10:52,333 --> 01:10:53,958
- Have you?
- I...

1467
01:10:54,583 --> 01:10:55,750
Have you?

1468
01:10:56,916 --> 01:10:57,750
Frankenstein!

1469
01:10:58,291 --> 01:10:59,500
[dog grunts]

1470
01:11:00,125 --> 01:11:01,041
[woman groans]

1471
01:11:01,125 --> 01:11:04,250
Did we just fall
for the old Frankenstein trick?

1472
01:11:05,541 --> 01:11:08,208
[whimpering]

1473
01:11:08,958 --> 01:11:10,375

[screams] Oh-ho!

1476
01:11:14,166 --> 01:11:15,041
[yells] Ya!

1477
01:11:17,166 --> 01:11:18,083

Well, looks like I have company.

So, we're going to take
a word from our scary sponsors.

- [whistles like theremin]
- [man] <i>W… T… C… H.</i>

- Aurora?
- [gasps]

1500
01:12:39,625 --> 01:12:41,500
- [deep voice] Hubie Dubois.
- Yes.

1501
01:12:41,583 --> 01:12:45,125
I'd recognize that voice anywhere.
You look exactly how I pictured you.

1502
01:12:45,208 --> 01:12:50,083
To be honest with you, you don't look like
the way I was picturing you.

1503
01:12:50,666 --> 01:12:53,541
[high-pitched voice] I guess my
radio voice throws people off sometimes.

1504
01:12:53,625 --> 01:12:55,166
Yeah, that... I think that's it.

1505
01:12:55,250 --> 01:12:56,875
[giggling in high-pitched voice]

1506
01:12:56,958 --> 01:12:58,125

01:13:01,166 --> 01:13:02,958
What brings you
all the way here this evenin'?

1509
01:13:03,041 --> 01:13:06,916
As you know, I'm a longtime listener,
and I always respect the advice you give

1510
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,083
to so many callers.

1511
01:13:08,166 --> 01:13:12,541
Right now, I'm in dire need
of the most perspicacious advice

1512
01:13:12,625 --> 01:13:14,750
- you have ever given to any other human...
- [knocking]

1513
01:13:15,375 --> 01:13:19,291
[Aurora gasps] Oh, my God. Isn't that
so sweet? My wife brought snacks.

1514
01:13:19,375 --> 01:13:22,625
[deep voice] Ooh!
Hey, baby. How you doin'?

1515
01:13:22,708 --> 01:13:25,041
Oh, and who is this?

1516
01:13:25,125 --> 01:13:26,708
Baby, this is Hubie Dubois.

1517
01:13:26,791 --> 01:13:28,833
Whoa! For real?

1518
01:13:28,916 --> 01:13:30,875
Yes. Nice to meet you, ma'am.

1519
01:13:30,958 --> 01:13:33,375
I'm looking forward
to hearing your real voice.

1520
01:13:34,125 --> 01:13:35,708
This is my real voice.

1521
01:13:36,625 --> 01:13:39,250
Right. I know it is.
I was just saying, you know…

1522
01:13:39,958 --> 01:13:42,291
So, I am a big fan
of your husband, Aurora.

1523
01:13:42,375 --> 01:13:43,500
Oh, yeah.

1524
01:13:43,583 --> 01:13:47,458
I feel like you're the second
most frequent caller we get.

1525
01:13:47,541 --> 01:13:50,416
- Besides that one lady.
- Someone calls more than I do?

1526
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:54,083
[laughs] Actually, I think she might have
a little something for you, Hubie.

1527
01:13:54,166 --> 01:13:57,625
She always dedicates
a song to a special someone.

1528
01:13:57,708 --> 01:13:58,750
Ooh!

1529
01:13:58,833 --> 01:14:01,541
And we all need that special someone.

1530
01:14:01,625 --> 01:14:03,291
- Right, baby?
- Yes, we do. Oh!

1531
01:14:03,375 --> 01:14:04,208
Dig in.

1532
01:14:04,291 --> 01:14:10,958
[both moaning]

1533
01:14:11,833 --> 01:14:13,708
- A couple days back…
- Oh, man.

1534
01:14:13,791 --> 01:14:17,166
…she had a couple glasses of Chardonnay.
Her guard was down,

1535
01:14:17,750 --> 01:14:20,666
and she asked
to dedicate a special song to Hubie.

1536
01:14:20,750 --> 01:14:23,750
- Chardonnay, eh?
- You know what they say about Chardonnay?

1537
01:14:24,583 --> 01:14:29,583
Truth serum. She said she's gonna show you
how much she loves you on Halloween.

1538
01:14:30,333 --> 01:14:34,125
- Do you think we could trace the number?
- I don't need to. Caller ID.

1539
01:14:34,208 --> 01:14:38,166
617-555-0968.

1540
01:14:38,250 --> 01:14:39,125
Sound familiar?

1541
01:14:39,208 --> 01:14:42,791
No. But there is a number
that needs to be dialed immediately.

1542
01:14:43,458 --> 01:14:44,291
911!

1543
01:14:46,916 --> 01:14:47,750
[hooting]

1544
01:14:51,875 --> 01:14:52,958
[computer beeping]

1545
01:14:53,666 --> 01:14:54,541
Oh.

1546
01:14:54,625 --> 01:14:56,250
It's a prepaid phone.

1547
01:14:56,333 --> 01:14:58,750
- [high-pitched voice] Bitch used a burner.
- Mm-hmm.

1548
01:14:59,875 --> 01:15:00,916
[moaning softly]

1549
01:15:01,916 --> 01:15:05,083
Any idea of someone
who might have a thing for you, or…

1550
01:15:05,166 --> 01:15:07,458
How would somebody
detect such a situation?

1551
01:15:07,541 --> 01:15:11,958
Anyone in town who seems like
they might actually enjoy talking to you.

1552
01:15:12,041 --> 01:15:15,000
There's one woman, but she's
the nicest lady I ever met my life.

1553
01:15:15,083 --> 01:15:17,166
Well, they all seem nice
till they kill you.

1554
01:15:17,250 --> 01:15:18,958
What's the desperate sicko's name?

1555
01:15:20,833 --> 01:15:21,750
Um…

1556
01:15:23,750 --> 01:15:25,958
[whispers] The high school hat trick,
Violet Valentine.

1557
01:15:26,041 --> 01:15:28,166
[laughing]

1558
01:15:29,375 --> 01:15:31,333
Her? And you?

1559
01:15:31,416 --> 01:15:32,333
I mean…

1560
01:15:33,958 --> 01:15:36,375
All right. Let's go see
if we can get ourselves a confession.

1561
01:15:36,458 --> 01:15:40,583
Ooh! This is some <i>Dateline</i> NBC shit.

1562
01:15:46,250 --> 01:15:49,208
[Hubie]
Stormhawk in position and petrified. Over.

1563
01:15:49,291 --> 01:15:51,583
All right. First of all,
we're not gonna use code names.

1564
01:15:51,666 --> 01:15:52,666
- Okay?
- [Hubie] <i>Copy.</i>

1565
01:15:52,750 --> 01:15:56,333
Did you send backup to my residence
to have eyes on my mother? Over.

1566
01:15:56,416 --> 01:15:58,125
I'm a little short-handed tonight,

1567
01:15:58,208 --> 01:15:59,916
so I asked Father Dave
to keep an eye on her.

1568
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:03,083
Negative! Request armed units
to that vicinity. Over.

1569
01:16:03,166 --> 01:16:05,333
Sorry. I can't spare the manpower tonight.

1570
01:16:05,416 --> 01:16:06,250
Here she comes.

1571
01:16:06,708 --> 01:16:10,708
Okay, Hubie. It's showtime.
Remember, we're lookin' for a confession.

1572
01:16:10,791 --> 01:16:12,500
But what if I can't get her to confess?
Over.

1573
01:16:12,583 --> 01:16:15,625
If you feel like you've done all you can,
or you feel like you're in danger,

1574
01:16:15,708 --> 01:16:18,875
say the code word. At that point,
we'll call the burner phone.

1575
01:16:18,958 --> 01:16:20,750
If she picks up,
we can implicate her that way.

1576
01:16:20,833 --> 01:16:22,416
And what's the code word again? Over.

1577
01:16:23,083 --> 01:16:25,125
- You don't have to say over.
- [Hubie] <i>Okay.</i>

1578
01:16:25,208 --> 01:16:26,500
Code word is pumpkin.

1579
01:16:27,083 --> 01:16:29,083
Roger that. Bogey on my twelve.

1580
01:16:29,166 --> 01:16:31,333
Three on a match.
Smoke 'em if you got 'em.

1581
01:16:31,416 --> 01:16:33,791
"Smoke 'em if you got..."
What the hell is he talking about?

1582
01:16:33,875 --> 01:16:35,083
I don't know.

1583
01:16:41,666 --> 01:16:43,666
What'd you ask me out here for, Hubie?

1584
01:16:43,750 --> 01:16:44,583
What's up?

1585
01:16:46,791 --> 01:16:47,625
Pumpkin.

1586
01:16:47,708 --> 01:16:48,583
[groans]

1587
01:16:48,666 --> 01:16:50,125
- Straight to pumpkin?
- Yeah.

1588
01:16:50,208 --> 01:16:52,166
Pumpkin what?

1589
01:16:52,250 --> 01:16:53,083
Just pumpkin.

1590
01:16:53,833 --> 01:16:54,666
Don't kill me.

1591
01:16:54,750 --> 01:16:56,583
- You gotta be kiddin' me.
- Dialing.

1592
01:16:57,250 --> 01:16:58,208
Hubie.

1593
01:16:59,166 --> 01:17:00,916
I would never hurt you.

1594
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:02,541
Thank you. Pumpkin.

1595
01:17:03,416 --> 01:17:04,541
Now! Pumpkin.

1596
01:17:04,625 --> 01:17:05,458
[call ringing]

1597
01:17:05,541 --> 01:17:06,916
- It's ringing.
- Is this a prank?

1598
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,000
Is there somebody watching us right now?

1599
01:17:09,083 --> 01:17:12,250
- No one can see us or hear us.
- She must not have the phone on her.

1600
01:17:12,708 --> 01:17:15,333
[heavy breathing]

1601
01:17:15,416 --> 01:17:16,250
Hello?

1602
01:17:17,666 --> 01:17:22,083
I just wanted to tell you that I have been
in love with you since second grade.

1603
01:17:22,708 --> 01:17:24,166
- What?
- Hello?

1604
01:17:24,250 --> 01:17:25,833
[whispers] Can you trace it now?

1605
01:17:25,916 --> 01:17:27,666
[heavy breathing continues]

1606
01:17:27,750 --> 01:17:32,291
Hubie, I've been in love
with you since the first grade.

1607
01:17:34,083 --> 01:17:35,750
What took you so long?

1608
01:17:36,875 --> 01:17:38,541
I was in love with our teacher.

1609
01:17:39,166 --> 01:17:40,000
Miss Glennon?

1610
01:17:41,083 --> 01:17:44,541
- Wasn't she, like, 70?
- I liked the way she smelled.

1611
01:17:46,458 --> 01:17:47,541
I can't believe this.

1612
01:17:48,083 --> 01:17:53,375
I can't believe that I spent three years
with a self-confident-for-no-reason,

1613
01:17:53,458 --> 01:17:56,958
bearded, human-ogre
when I could have been with you.

1614
01:17:57,041 --> 01:17:58,791
Ouch. That even hurt me.

1615
01:18:00,791 --> 01:18:03,625
I'm getting a location.
Steve, look at this.

1616
01:18:04,583 --> 01:18:07,125
- [Steve] <i>Stormhawk, abort!</i>
- I thought you were out of my league.

1617
01:18:07,208 --> 01:18:08,833
- Why?
- Stormhawk, repeat, abort!

1618
01:18:08,916 --> 01:18:10,583
It's the best news
I ever heard in my life.

1619
01:18:10,666 --> 01:18:13,291
Abort.
The killer's cell phone is in your house!

1620
01:18:13,375 --> 01:18:14,958
Mama!

1621
01:18:15,041 --> 01:18:17,583
No! No way!

1622
01:18:17,666 --> 01:18:20,708
Lock your doors!
Make sure you don't open them!

1623
01:18:20,791 --> 01:18:23,541
Take care of your children!
I'm gonna steal a boat!

1624
01:18:23,625 --> 01:18:25,458
Mama!

1625
01:18:27,541 --> 01:18:28,458
I love you!

1626
01:18:35,708 --> 01:18:38,333
[clock chiming]

1627
01:18:42,333 --> 01:18:44,875
Oh, no. They got Father Dave.

1628
01:18:48,250 --> 01:18:49,208
Oh, my God.

1629
01:18:49,291 --> 01:18:50,916
- Boo!
- [screaming]

1630
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,500
[laughing]

1631
01:18:54,083 --> 01:18:55,791
Why aren't you watching my mother?

1632
01:18:55,875 --> 01:18:59,041
The killer's in the house!
The killer's in the house!

1633
01:18:59,125 --> 01:19:00,958
There's no one in the house but her.

1634
01:19:02,208 --> 01:19:03,041
Hubie?

1635
01:19:03,875 --> 01:19:04,958
Can you help me down?

1636
01:19:06,458 --> 01:19:07,666
Ma! Ma!

1637
01:19:11,083 --> 01:19:12,041
You're okay.

1638
01:19:13,708 --> 01:19:16,166
Why, yes, Hubie. Why wouldn't I be?

1639
01:19:16,916 --> 01:19:17,791
Mmm.

1640
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:26,333
Oh, no.

1641
01:19:33,791 --> 01:19:35,000
{\an8}So, um…

1642
01:19:36,500 --> 01:19:39,458
Am I your special someone, Mom?

1643
01:19:40,333 --> 01:19:41,458
Always, Hubie.

1644
01:19:42,041 --> 01:19:42,916
Mm-hmm.

1645
01:19:43,500 --> 01:19:46,000
And… today, did you...

1646
01:19:47,500 --> 01:19:50,041
Did you try to show me
just how much you love me?

1647
01:19:51,208 --> 01:19:54,500
Why, yes, I did, Hubie. I truly did.

1648
01:20:13,125 --> 01:20:14,541
- [man 1] Hubie!
- [woman 1] Hubie!

1649
01:20:14,625 --> 01:20:16,416
[man 1] Get us out of here! Help!

1650
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:18,833
[Landolfa]
Hubie, please, get us out of here!

1651
01:20:18,916 --> 01:20:20,791
[all shouting hysterically]

1652
01:20:20,875 --> 01:20:22,625
Hubie, there's something
wrong with your mom!

1653
01:20:22,708 --> 01:20:24,833
Come on over here
and let me punch your mom in the face!

1654
01:20:24,916 --> 01:20:27,458
I mean, the good news is
you're still alive. I was...

1655
01:20:27,541 --> 01:20:29,833
Nice observation, toolbox!
Now get us out of this!

1656
01:20:29,916 --> 01:20:34,375
- I'm so sorry.
- I tried to explain to you already, Hubie.

1657
01:20:34,458 --> 01:20:37,958
If you don't fight back,
the bullies never stop.

1658
01:20:38,041 --> 01:20:40,500
So, I had to fight back for you.

1659
01:20:40,583 --> 01:20:42,083
[Mike] Please, Hubie!
Oh, my God!

1660
01:20:42,166 --> 01:20:43,250
Hubie, that's gas!

1661
01:20:43,333 --> 01:20:46,708
Mommy, I would've been satisfied if you
put itching powder in their sleeping bag.

1662
01:20:46,791 --> 01:20:48,000
This is extreme.

1663
01:20:48,791 --> 01:20:51,500
Don't do this to me.
Hubie, I'll be your friend forever!

1664
01:20:51,583 --> 01:20:53,041
[tires screech]

1665
01:20:53,125 --> 01:20:54,333
[all chattering, shouting]

1666
01:20:54,416 --> 01:20:56,333
[man] The old lady said
they'd be in the backyard.

1667
01:20:56,416 --> 01:20:57,500
[Tracy] Roll it! Roll it!

1668
01:20:57,583 --> 01:20:59,333
You don't have to do this.
This is too much.

1669
01:20:59,416 --> 01:21:04,083
{\an8}We are here and we are live at
an unfolding scene of Halloween horror.

1670
01:21:04,166 --> 01:21:06,750
- [victims shouting, chattering]
- [Hubie]<i> Ma. Ma.</i>

1671
01:21:06,833 --> 01:21:09,958
- Mom, I really don't want you to do this.
- I know, Hubie.

1672
01:21:10,041 --> 01:21:13,708
That's what makes you so wonderful.
And that's why I have to do it.

1673
01:21:13,791 --> 01:21:16,250
I have to make it
good for you before I go.

1674
01:21:16,333 --> 01:21:17,166
Before you go?

1675
01:21:18,291 --> 01:21:21,166
- To Heaven?
- No. Probably going to Hell, Hubie.

1676
01:21:21,250 --> 01:21:22,541
[sirens wailing]

1677
01:21:22,625 --> 01:21:25,750
The cops are here!
You're goin' to jail, you crazy old bat!

1678
01:21:25,833 --> 01:21:29,666
- Well, then I better do this now.
- [Mr. Hennessy] My God. No, lady. Wait.

1679
01:21:29,750 --> 01:21:32,083
- [all screaming, shouting]
- No! No, no, no, no!

1680
01:21:32,166 --> 01:21:33,958
- Please don't.
- [Landolfa] Hubie, stop her.

1681
01:21:34,041 --> 01:21:37,625
[voices muted]

1682
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:40,750
[distorted, echoing] Help me!

1683
01:21:44,125 --> 01:21:46,000
- Hubie!
- [Hubie screams]

1684
01:21:46,083 --> 01:21:48,000
[Landolfa laughing]

1685
01:21:49,833 --> 01:21:50,666
No!

1686
01:21:51,541 --> 01:21:53,916
[screaming]

1687
01:21:54,666 --> 01:21:55,708
[echoing] No.

1688
01:21:57,166 --> 01:21:59,583
[screaming] No!

1689
01:22:00,625 --> 01:22:07,500
[all laughing maniacally]

1690
01:22:12,166 --> 01:22:16,250
Always thinking of everyone else,
never thinking of yourself.

1691
01:22:16,333 --> 01:22:18,541
But I guess that's why you're a hero.

1692
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:21,875
[Landolfa] Hubie!

1693
01:22:22,458 --> 01:22:25,041

1695
01:22:44,958 --> 01:22:46,458
- Man.
- Freeze, Mrs. Dubois!

1696
01:22:48,208 --> 01:22:49,833
Hold your fire until my command.

1697
01:22:50,333 --> 01:22:51,500
Why did we bring them again?

1698
01:22:51,583 --> 01:22:53,958
There was nobody left at the station.
We had to.

1699
01:22:54,041 --> 01:22:56,625
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Mommy.
This is my fault.

1700
01:22:56,708 --> 01:22:58,416
- [Mom] That's okay, Hubie.
- [Landolfa] Hubie!

1701
01:22:58,500 --> 01:23:00,541
- Untie us, dummy!
- Come on, you stupid dummy!

1702
01:23:00,625 --> 01:23:02,833
- Untie us, now!
- [Mike] Are you paying attention?

1703
01:23:02,916 --> 01:23:04,625
[Mom] Okay. Wow.

1704
01:23:05,250 --> 01:23:06,750
Shame on you.

1705
01:23:06,833 --> 01:23:10,125
Hubie just saved your lives,
and you treat him like this.

1706
01:23:10,916 --> 01:23:12,958
Can one of you tell me why?

1707
01:23:13,041 --> 01:23:14,708
[Landolfa] Just look at him!

1708
01:23:14,791 --> 01:23:16,625
He's so… Hubie!

1709

[all snickering]

1710
01:23:18,583 --> 01:23:20,041
Yes, he's Hubie.

1711
01:23:20,125 --> 01:23:21,666
He's helpful.

1712
01:23:22,375 --> 01:23:25,875
He's courteous,
he's cheerful, he's considerate.

1713
01:23:25,958 --> 01:23:27,833
What a bad, bad man.

1714
01:23:27,916 --> 01:23:31,958
My great-great-great-great-great-
grandmother laid down her life,

1715
01:23:32,041 --> 01:23:34,125
trying to save innocent people.

1716
01:23:34,208 --> 01:23:35,416
I was there.

1717
01:23:35,500 --> 01:23:41,000
And my son did her one better.
He just saved four ungrateful jackasses.

1718
01:23:41,750 --> 01:23:42,583
Thanks, Pubie.

1719
01:23:42,666 --> 01:23:45,541
Well, you can't even
thank him without insulting him.

1720
01:23:45,625 --> 01:23:48,583
I'm sorry. I don't know why I said Pubie.
It just came out.

1721
01:23:48,666 --> 01:23:51,375
Could it be because you feel threatened?

[stammers]

1723
01:23:54,541 --> 01:23:56,958
I feel a lot of pressure
to be cool all the time.

1724
01:23:57,916 --> 01:24:00,166
I'm jealous of Hubie
being able to be himself.

1725
01:24:00,708 --> 01:24:03,250
I lost my hair 20 years ago,

1726
01:24:03,333 --> 01:24:05,750
and every time I walk into a room,
I feel silly.

1727
01:24:06,333 --> 01:24:11,083
Why should someone like Hubie
have such a thick, luxuriant head of hair,

1728
01:24:11,166 --> 01:24:13,875
and I look like a California raisin?

1729
01:24:15,166 --> 01:24:17,208
I have never felt sexually fulfilled.

1730
01:24:17,291 --> 01:24:18,666
- But...
- Oh, shut up, Lester.

1731
01:24:18,750 --> 01:24:21,083
You're usually there. You know it's true.

1732
01:24:21,166 --> 01:24:22,791
I'm guessing…

1733
01:24:22,875 --> 01:24:25,250
Hubie hasn't had a lot of sex.

1734
01:24:25,916 --> 01:24:26,750
No, ma'am.

1735
01:24:27,666 --> 01:24:28,916
Hasn't had any sex.

1736
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:29,833
Mmm.

1737
01:24:30,916 --> 01:24:32,625
But what he does have is hope.

1738
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:36,666
Damn him and his hope!

1739
01:24:39,583 --> 01:24:42,708
I was diagnosed
with dyslexia in the eighth grade.

1740
01:24:43,458 --> 01:24:47,875
I faked it for the doctors,
but I'm really just dumb.

1741
01:24:48,583 --> 01:24:50,708
I never really told anybody.

1742
01:24:51,708 --> 01:24:53,916
You're probably all surprised.

1743
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:55,666
- No, I'm not surprised.
- Nope.

1744
01:24:55,750 --> 01:24:56,833
- You surprised?
- [laughs] No.

1745
01:24:57,583 --> 01:25:02,291
But Hubie uses big words,
and they come out so natural for him.

1746
01:25:02,375 --> 01:25:03,750
It pisses me off.

1747
01:25:04,250 --> 01:25:05,708
Oh, 'cause of the dumb thing.

1748
01:25:06,583 --> 01:25:09,083
My brother-in-law
once said that I had no ambition.

1749
01:25:10,416 --> 01:25:12,583
And then he bit me,
and I became a werewolf.

1750
01:25:13,750 --> 01:25:14,666
[howls softly]

1751
01:25:16,083 --> 01:25:16,916
You see?

1752
01:25:17,708 --> 01:25:21,500
Hubie's smart,
has nice hair, and sex hope.

1753
01:25:22,166 --> 01:25:23,000
But to me,

1754
01:25:23,666 --> 01:25:25,708
<i>his best quality is this.</i>

1755
01:25:25,791 --> 01:25:30,333
<i>He can weather all of your insults
and your thrown objects,</i>

1756
01:25:30,416 --> 01:25:34,333
<i>and he responds with humor
and... and kindness.</i>

1757
01:25:34,958 --> 01:25:36,291
Could you say the same?

1758
01:25:36,375 --> 01:25:40,875
Could any of you take
the abuse you dish out to my Hubie?

1759
01:25:42,791 --> 01:25:46,166
I busted a guy for DWI last week, and, uh…

1760
01:25:46,958 --> 01:25:50,458
He said it was an honor
to be arrested by a Muppet.

1761
01:25:51,916 --> 01:25:53,500
I acted like I didn't hear him.

1762
01:25:54,416 --> 01:25:57,000
But then I cried in my squad car
for about half an hour.

1763
01:25:57,375 --> 01:26:01,375
You see, Hubie. True bravery's being kind.

1764
01:26:01,833 --> 01:26:04,458
Even to those who are being cruel to you.

1765
01:26:05,166 --> 01:26:07,250
I just always wanted
to be as nice as you, Mom.

1766
01:26:07,333 --> 01:26:08,625
Oh, you were nicer.

1767
01:26:09,333 --> 01:26:13,958
But now I know that you're ready
to spread your wings and fly without me.

1768
01:26:14,041 --> 01:26:16,416
You don't have to be scared anymore.

1769
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:18,458
I'm feeling emotional.

1770
01:26:18,541 --> 01:26:20,583
- And a little horny.
- Ooh!

1771
01:26:20,666 --> 01:26:22,000
- Not for you.
- Oh.

1772
01:26:22,083 --> 01:26:25,166
Just know that I'll always love you.

1773
01:26:25,250 --> 01:26:26,791

We fell for that twice in one night.

with the orderlies when we get back.

Why did his mom
have to kill Peanut the pig?

1786
01:27:00,875 --> 01:27:04,000
That was me, actually.
I had a case of the late-night munchies.

1787
01:27:04,458 --> 01:27:06,958
All right, we gotta get these guys
back to the mental institution.
