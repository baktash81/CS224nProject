3
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,360
was born more than
a thousand years ago...

4
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:16,730
in Cornwall England...

5
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,230
near Land's End.

6
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,630
There was a time
when the kingdom of Cornwall...

7
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:25,900
lived in fear and trembling
of the black prince Pendragon...

8
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:29,240
master of all witches
giants and hobgoblins...

9
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,510
who ravaged the land.

10
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,710
But at long last
Herla the wizard...

11
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:39,240
drove Pendragon and all
his witches from the kingdom...

12
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:43,520
and exiled them beyond
the reaches of the known world.

13
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,860
Here on a misty isle...

14
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:51,330
uncharted and unknown...

15
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,160
Pendragon schemed
and waited for the day...

16
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,860
when he would return
to power in Cornwall.

17
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:02,540
Then after many years
the day came.

18
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:05,810
It was a day of great rejoicing
in Cornwall...

19
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,080
and kings and princes
bearing gifts...

20
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:12,020
came to celebrate
a special occasion.

21
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:14,450
Know then Princess Elaine...

22
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,360
that as you are
by the grace of God...

23
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:21,120
the only child
of our noble king...

24
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,260
therefore I now place
upon your head...

25
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:30,030
this ancient coronet
of the house of Cornwall.

26
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:35,370
May you wear it in honor
as befits our future queen.

27
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,930
Rise Elaine.

28
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:42,480
Trumpeters
proclaim the festivities.

29
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:44,750
Let the bells ring.

30
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:49,320
Health and happiness
to the princess Elaine!

31
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:52,450
May she live
to be a hundred years!

32
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:59,330
For the great Elaine's
birthday.

33
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,500
Come on! Move aside!
For your country!

34
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:08,770
As the people of Cornwall
celebrated Pendragon arrived.

35
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:13,480
Make way!

36
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,640
And now
the presentation of gifts!

37
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,020
His Highness...

38
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:22,990
Vallons Duke of Normandy.

39
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:40,810
His Excellency
the prince of Tarquin Isle...

40
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,540
Elidorus.

41
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:45,740
It is exquisite
King Meliodas.

42
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:47,370
Elidorus?

43
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:48,750
Know you this prince
Chancellor?

44
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,180
Never have I heard the name...

45
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:54,520
yet there's something faintly
familiar if I can but recall.

46
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:01,420
Your most gracious majesty
King Mark...

47
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,430
I apologize for the lateness
of my arrival.

48
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,700
Prince Elidorus?
I cannot seem to remember.

49
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:09,100
When was it that we met?

50
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:11,570
We never have Your Majesty.

51
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,440
Yet you honor
my daughter's birthday?

52
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:18,910
I have always admired
the crown of Cornwall.

53
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:21,680
Therefore I took the liberty of
bringing Her Royal Highness...

54
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:25,780
a small but unique gift.

55
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:28,320
If you please Garna.

56
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,980
Certainly master.

57
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,360
Thank you Prince.

58
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:37,830
May I see what's inside?

59
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,990
Allow me Princess.

60
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,810
A music box.

61
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,580
He walks.

62
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:03,280
Why he could almost be alive.

63
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,620
A nation merchant
of whom I acquired him...

64
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:09,420
spoke of a curious talent.

65
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:13,460
Look Father
what an unusual gift.

66
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:22,040
I believe
he wishes this dance.

67
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:24,340
Certainly my cavalier.

68
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,750
Oh you were wonderful.

69
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:15,090
What an enchanting gift
Prince Elidorus.

70
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,930
Enter.

71
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:28,500
More gifts.

72
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:30,810
Bring them over here.

73
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,970
Put them on the table.

74
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,470
Careful now.

75
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,490
You were lovely today
Princess.

76
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,360
Your father was proud of you.

77
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:52,160
I think my father
is slightly prejudiced.

78
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:55,500
It was nice to be remembered
by so many people.

79
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:01,170
One day it'll be a crown
you'll be wearing...

80
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,440
the queen of a mighty kingdom.

81
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:05,670
My father still has
many good years ahead of him.

82
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,610
I don't like to think
about that day.

83
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,150
Of course not.

84
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:12,810
When you're young
it's only today that counts.

85
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:14,450
Into bed with you.

86
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:20,620
Good night Princess.

87
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,490
Sleep well Lady Constance.

88
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:22,650
A pity to shatter your innocent
dreams Princess Elaine...

89
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,780
but the throne of Cornwall
is to be mine...

90
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:29,960
and only you can
give it to me.

91
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:06,500
Garna quickly.

92
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:11,300
Cormoran will meet you
at the place appointed.

93
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:15,500
Be assured master.
All will be as you wish.

94
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,580
No! No!

95
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:00,380
Princess!

96
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:01,820
It's the princess!

97
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:03,620
Something's happened
to the princess!

98
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:05,920
Guards! Guards!

99
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:07,320
The princess!

100
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:11,660
No! No!

101
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:13,360
My daughter!

102
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:18,560
Elaine! Elaine!

103
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,810
Make room.

104
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,500
Break it down.

105
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,810
Elaine!

106
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,280
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

107
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:35,410
A giant is running off
with the princess!

108
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:37,980
Alarm! Sound the alarm!

109
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:42,720
Guards! Guards! Stop him!

110
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,080
Stop him men!

111
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,960
Lower the gates!

112
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:17,160
Drop the portcullis!

113
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,510
Get him!

114
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,960
Repair the bridge men!

115
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:21,190
Axes and poles!

116
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,290
Guards lend a hand!

117
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,990
We can't let him
out of our sight!

118
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:31,700
It's been years
since giants were banished.

119
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:34,670
Why would they return now?

120
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,510
Why?

121
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:44,010
Come on Jonathan Tom.
It's a beautiful day.

122
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:03,030
OK Tom. Come on back.

123
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,930
Back back.

124
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:08,970
Come on Tom.

125
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:11,980
Come on.

126
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:15,910
What's the matter
with you two this morning?

127
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,850
We have to get that feed to town
whether you like it or not.

128
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,350
Now come on.
No more nonsense. Back.

129
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,820
What's going on
around here?

130
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:09,160
Well done Cormoran.

131
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:15,470
Leaving so soon Princess?

132
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,570
Why your voyage
has just begun.

133
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:21,840
No no no!
Let me go please! Help!

134
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,940
Who's to hear you Princess?

135
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,880
Now quiet!
The master has planned...

136
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:29,250
a nice long voyage for you
in honor of your birthday!

137
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,650
Don't!

138
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:56,950
Cormoran!

139
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:58,580
Cormoran!

140
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,450
Look out!

141
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,830
Cormoran!

142
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,510
Cormoran after them!

143
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,250
Head them off!
Bring them back!

144
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,150
Head them off!

145
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,360
Quick the loft!

146
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:21,510
Look out! Run!

147
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:41,270
Are you all right?

148
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,810
You've done it.

149
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,470
You killed him.

150
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,040
It was nothing.

151
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,170
I kill a giant every morning
before breakfast.

152
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,580
Starts my day right.

153
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:55,650
I think you'd better
put this on.

154
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:23,470
You farmer.
Have you seen the princess?

155
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:25,350
Your Majesty.

156
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:27,320
Kneel girl. It's the king.

157
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:29,580
The princess Your Majesty?

158
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:32,180
Elaine. Young man...

159
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:35,390
be good enough to come down
from there with my daughter.

160
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:40,260
Oh l... I'm sorry Princess.

161
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:42,100
I didn't know.

162
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:43,470
Well young man?

163
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:46,530
We mustrt keep
the king waiting.

164
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,610
Elaine.

165
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,050
Father.

166
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:59,210
The Lord has been merciful.

167
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:01,810
Oh father
this is the young man...

168
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:04,320
who so bravely rescued me
from the giant.

169
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:05,380
Rise my boy.

170
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,020
Jack Jack.

171
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:09,460
Oh Jack.

172
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:11,190
You're safe.

173
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,790
When I saw
that horrible monster...

174
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:16,360
Mother this is the king.

175
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,900
Your Majesty.

176
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:21,630
Rise madame.

177
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:25,610
Forgive me. I was so thankful
to see my son alive.

178
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,740
I'm so thankful
to see my daughter alive.

179
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:31,980
Oh poor child. I have some
hot porridge on the fire.

180
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:33,380
She'll need warmth and rest...

181
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:36,010
before she returns
to the castle.

182
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:41,960
You've done a most
remarkable deed young man.

183
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:43,050
Thank you Your Majesty.

184
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:45,330
I'm proud to serve the king
as my father did.

185
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,590
Your father served the crown?

186
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:48,030
Yes in the royal archers.

187
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,300
He fell at the Battle
of Land's End.

188
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:53,810
A noble battle then
a noble battle now.

189
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:56,710
Your father would have been
proud of you this day.

190
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:59,540
Come let's have a look
at your giant.

191
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:13,360
Hideous creature.

192
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:16,450
The boat... the strange boat that
was taking the princess away.

193
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:18,500
Hurry Your Majesty.

194
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,500
But it was...

195
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:27,970
There it is...
the small black craft.

196
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:31,840
And there was a strange
dwarf-like man Your Majesty.

197
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:33,680
The servant Garna.

198
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:35,870
You know him Sire?

199
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:39,510
I know him...
and his master.

200
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,940
Master!

201
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:00,340
Master!

202
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:01,970
Master Pendragon!

203
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,240
What happened?

204
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:05,370
Calamity O prince.

205
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:08,780
Most fateful disaster.

206
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:11,550
The princess...
where is she?

207
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:14,990
Cormoran is dead...
slain by a young farmer.

208
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:18,050
By now the princess is back
in her father's castle.

209
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:20,150
Impossible. You're lying.

210
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:22,700
I tell the truth master.
I swear it.

211
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:25,490
He took her from me at the boat
and then killed the giant.

212
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,330
I saw it with my own eyes.

213
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,630
Blundering fool.

214
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,730
A fury take you
to your torment...

215
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:34,500
all of you!

216
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:37,010
I scheme a thousand nights...

217
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,870
put the princess
in your very hands.

218
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:41,280
And you imbecile idiot...

219
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:44,910
allow a mere farmer
a mortal to defy me.

220
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:46,780
We have failed master.

221
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:49,380
We have failed.

222
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:53,520
But only for a moment.

223
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:59,430
I shall have the princess
and the farmer shall die.

224
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:05,030
By all the powers of darkness
he shall die.

225
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:09,510
For returning to us
the princess...

226
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:11,840
alive and well...

227
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:14,240
as by a miracle...

228
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:18,220
and so delivering us from
the ravages of our enemies...

229
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:21,880
we dub thee Sir Jack...

230
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,650
protector of the realm.

231
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,560
Rise Sir Jack.

232
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:33,520
May you serve this court
with honor...

233
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,570
as did your father
before you.

234
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,660
- So be it.
- Amen.

235
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:38,500
Your Majesty.

236
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:40,670
Your Majesty.

237
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:41,670
What is it Chancellor?

238
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,710
We must talk privately
at once.

239
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:46,580
- Can't it wait?
- This is very important.

240
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:48,770
Very well.
Attend Sir Jack daughter.

241
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:51,650
I'll return presently.

242
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:54,240
Congratulations
upon your knighthood Sir Jack.

243
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,880
- I'm so proud of you Jack.
- Sir Jack now.

244
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,360
I'm honored to shake
your hand Sir Jack.

245
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:00,550
At long last a hero
in the court who is young.

246
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:02,120
And handsome.

247
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,590
It's a bit warm here.

248
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:05,790
Would you mind seeing me
to the terrace Sir Jack?

249
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:07,530
Certainly Princess.

250
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,600
Thank you for rescuing me.

251
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:14,500
You saved my life once
remember?

252
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:16,060
Hail to Sir Jack.

253
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,670
To Jack the Giant Killer.

254
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:19,580
Hail Sir Jack!

255
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:20,870
Hail Sir Jack.

256
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:24,040
I think my rescuer
has acquired a new name.

257
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:27,350
I seem to have acquired
more than a new name.

258
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:29,120
It's a great honor.

259
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:31,820
I only hope
I can be won'thy of it.

260
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:35,160
That's my father's way
of thanking you.

261
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:37,490
This is mine.

262
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,300
I shall immediately go out
and find another giant to slay.

263
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:45,500
Before breakfast?

264
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:51,710
"Know also that these
ageless giants with horns...

265
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:53,510
"and satyr-like features...

266
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:55,880
"who roam
our Cornwall countryside...

267
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:57,280
"destroy and plunder...

268
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:59,440
"at the bidding
of their master Pendragon."

269
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,920
These records were lost
among the archives...

270
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:03,290
of your father's reign.

271
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,020
I've only just uncovered them.

272
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:08,290
Then this Prince Elidorus
is really Pendragon in disguise.

273
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,450
The prince of witches.

274
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,140
But why would he want
to seize the princess? Why?

275
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:21,970
If we knew that
we'd know what to do.

276
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:26,980
There's only one thing
we can do.

277
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:36,010
We were fortunate this time...

278
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:38,990
but Pendragon is certain
to make another attempt.

279
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:42,720
I'm going to entrust you with
the most important mission...

280
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,390
ever given
to a Cornish knight...

281
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:48,300
to protect the life of
the princess until she's safe.

282
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:50,630
I will certainly try to be
won'thy of your trust Sire...

283
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,570
but is one guard enough?

284
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,470
Our only defense is secrecy.

285
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:56,270
There aren't enough men
in all Cornwall...

286
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,830
to protect the life
of the princess...

287
00:26:57,910 --> 00:27:01,010
should her whereabouts
become known to Pendragon.

288
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:06,940
At dawn you and Elaine
disguised as peasants...

289
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:09,510
will travel to a convent
in Normandy.

290
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:11,820
When the princess
is safely within its walls...

291
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:14,420
you will return here.

292
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:18,460
That means
I'm to live in exile.

293
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:21,860
It won't be easy Father.

294
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:25,770
Believe me Elaine
it's the only way.

295
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,270
Very well Father.

296
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:29,870
I'm ready to do
whatever's best.

297
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,810
Go now.

298
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:35,250
Prepare yourself
for the journey.

299
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,750
Good night Father.

300
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:38,980
Good night my dear.

301
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:42,420
We have plans to make.

302
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:44,980
The dawn comes much too soon.

303
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:32,460
You'd better go now.

304
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:35,570
It's getting late.

305
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,870
Is there anything more
I can do for you mistress?

306
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:40,280
No nothing more
Lady Constance.

307
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:42,280
I shall miss you.

308
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:44,780
And I shall pray
for your safe journey.

309
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:48,480
We'll send word as soon as
it's safe to return to Cornwall.

310
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,420
Take care of her Jack.

311
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:55,980
No one will harm her
while I live Your Majesty.

312
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:19,310
Quiet Gaunt quiet.

313
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:28,260
We have a mission for you
at last...

314
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:30,660
a most interesting mission.

315
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:42,100
Patience patience.

316
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:44,300
Patience.

317
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:53,640
Fly straight and true Gaunt.

318
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:56,990
Our master will be most eager
for your message.

319
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:09,560
Master.

320
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:14,040
Master! Black prince!

321
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:17,240
Look! It has come
from the castle.

322
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:21,910
So you finally decided
to visit us eh Gaunt?

323
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:25,010
Bringing a little present.

324
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:29,210
She sails
with the morning tide.

325
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:33,620
What kind of a voyage
is it to be eh Tubo?

326
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:36,060
Smooth and tranquil?

327
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:50,380
All right lads
bear a hand on that halyard!

328
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:53,140
You man lay a hand there!

329
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:54,580
Heave!

330
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:56,380
Heave!

331
00:30:56,450 --> 00:30:58,510
Heave!

332
00:30:58,590 --> 00:30:59,550
Heave!

333
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:01,950
Lay your backs into it lads!

334
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:03,550
Heave!

335
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:05,720
Heave!

336
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:07,560
Heave!

337
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:08,790
Heave!

338
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,020
How goes it Captain?

339
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:15,500
Fair skies
and a spankir breeze.

340
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:19,130
No man could ask for better.

341
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:21,940
I haven't seen miss Elaine
since mid-mornir.

342
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:23,770
Nor I.
She's not in her cabin.

343
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,140
Probably with the helmsman.

344
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:30,180
Come on mind the wheel Jack.

345
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:32,220
Peter!

346
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:37,490
Aye Father.

347
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:40,720
Have you seen
our lady passenger?

348
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:43,320
Aye. She's here with me.

349
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,830
Well come up
and lend a hand lad.

350
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:48,530
- We've got a landfall to make.
- Aye Captain.

351
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,200
He's a fine lad your son.

352
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:55,170
That he is.
And smart as paint.

353
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:58,340
And he can haul a jib
as proper as any man aboard.

354
00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:00,400
Here you are son.
Take over the helm.

355
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,970
I'll get a bite to eat.

356
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:04,210
Jack you can give
Miss Elaine...

357
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,680
her first glance
at the continent.

358
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:07,380
Thank you Captain.

359
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:10,980
Oh you can see much better
from up there off the larboard.

360
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:19,060
Helmsman
keep her teeth in the wind.

361
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:22,070
Aye Captain.

362
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:32,410
I didn't realize
we were so close to shore.

363
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,910
This makes it even closer.
Do you want to look?

364
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:38,470
It's already too close.

365
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:42,450
Soon I'll be in the convent
and you'll be going back.

366
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,960
I'll be alone.

367
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:45,550
The sisters will take
good care of you.

368
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,890
It's been such
a wonderful voyage...

369
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:52,400
just the two of us.

370
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,660
I wish I didn't have
to go in hiding...

371
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:57,030
that I could stay
as a make-believe peasant girl.

372
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:00,040
I wish I were a genie
to make your wish come true.

373
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:04,670
Suppose you were?
What would you do?

374
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:07,540
I would turn myself
into a great prince...

375
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:09,840
and I would search every farm
and village of England...

376
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:13,080
until I found you.

377
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:15,750
Then I would hold you
and tell you that I love you.

378
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:20,990
And I would answer
that I love you.

379
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:26,000
But it wouldn't be make-believe
Jack because it's true.

380
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:36,140
And then we'd fly away
on my magic carpet...

381
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:38,540
and live happily
together forever after.

382
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:40,510
Jack.

383
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:47,890
All right lads! Heave!

384
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:49,980
- Heave!
- Ho!

385
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:51,520
- Heave!
- Ho!

386
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:53,620
All right lay your backs
to it lads!

387
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:55,350
- Heave!
- Ho!

388
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:56,830
- Heave!
- Ho!

389
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,860
- Heave!
- Ho!

390
00:33:58,930 --> 00:34:00,330
- Heave!
- Ho!

391
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:06,760
Pipe the captain!

392
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:09,270
All hands lay to!

393
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:11,640
What happened?

394
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:13,980
Captain!

395
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:19,650
Rocks Captain.
We've run aground.

396
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:21,710
Mid-channel?
There are no rocks here.

397
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:24,720
All hands lay to!

398
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:26,820
- Are you all right lad?
- Aye.

399
00:34:26,890 --> 00:34:27,880
What did we hit?

400
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,490
I don't know. Look at the sky.

401
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:33,820
It's turning dark.

402
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:34,830
And we've stopped moving.

403
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,700
'Tis unnatural.

404
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:40,000
Captain look aloft!

405
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:42,570
Witches!

406
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,040
Witches!

407
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:45,910
Witches!

408
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:03,530
Who is it Captain?

409
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,890
This witch is accursed.

410
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:09,060
- It's the work of the devil.
- It's the devil himself.

411
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:11,660
Devil or witch
or whatever you are!

412
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:17,200
You may have the wind on me now
but you'll not scuttle my ship.

413
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:22,240
Captain!

414
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:47,500
Witches!

415
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,410
Witches!

416
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,040
We're doomed!

417
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:00,640
- Run for you lives!
- Witches witches!

418
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,520
- Witches!
- Come with me.

419
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:08,560
Peter up here!

420
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:11,030
Witches!

421
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:13,290
Father here.

422
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:16,870
Lock the door
and let no one in.

423
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:18,200
Witches! Witches!

424
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:24,310
Witches!

425
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:27,970
A witch!

426
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:32,180
Captain! Captain!

427
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:33,650
More witches
on the quarter deck.

428
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:39,480
Witches!

429
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:03,850
Sail across my bow will you?

430
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,420
Father!

431
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,760
Father!

432
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:24,760
Jack!

433
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:49,060
Jack Jack!

434
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:34,900
Look!

435
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:55,320
Jack!

436
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:20,620
Jack Jack!

437
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,760
No!

438
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:51,710
Elaine!

439
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:16,510
The witches! They're going!

440
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:21,010
Father!

441
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:23,740
We're moving.

442
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:25,250
Look it's getting light.

443
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:30,020
Captain.

444
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,030
Let's head for home!

445
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:39,720
They mustrt
turn back the ship.

446
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:42,560
Captain!

447
00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:45,530
Back to England it is lads.

448
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,500
Make ready to come about.

449
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:49,940
Bosun I'm taking command
of this ship.

450
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:52,100
Oh you are?
You hear that lads?

451
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:53,540
Our passenger's
taking command of the ship.

452
00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:56,670
- In His Majesty's name.
- In His Majesty's name.

453
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,480
And where would our Royal
Highness wish us to sail him?

454
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:02,890
We're going to save the girl.

455
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,950
His Majesty can have
this blasted tub...

456
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:06,820
as soon as we're safe
ashore at Cornwall.

457
00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:10,290
As for me I'll not sail in the
wake of those accursed witches.

458
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:13,360
Turn to we're comir about.

459
00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:17,700
Listen you men!
Sail to England...

460
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:19,760
and you'll all swing
from the gallows!

461
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:22,360
Elaine is the royal princess
of Cornwall!

462
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:25,930
Aye and I'm the caliph
of Baghdad.

463
00:41:27,810 --> 00:41:29,710
Well then
throw him overboard!

464
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:31,440
Over the side!

465
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:37,520
Over the side!

466
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,830
I'll get ya!

467
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:19,000
Jack Jack!

468
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:30,830
Jack!

469
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:12,810
O Isis...

470
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:17,050
keeper of the magic flame...

471
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:21,290
behold thy shrouded minions...

472
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:24,990
demons of the dark assembled...

473
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:31,530
to prepare before the altar
of thy eternal flame...

474
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:39,510
a neophyte to serve thee
in thy mystic labyrinth.

475
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:57,290
Behold...

476
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:59,460
O Isis...

477
00:43:59,530 --> 00:44:03,990
the eye of ancient Egypt.

478
00:44:05,670 --> 00:44:07,540
Arumah...

479
00:44:07,610 --> 00:44:11,840
Barabas Urgat.

480
00:44:11,910 --> 00:44:13,900
Maruga...

481
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:18,920
Maroya Garat.

482
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:23,280
Awake Princess of Cornwall.

483
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:27,990
Open thine eyes.

484
00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:36,120
Gaze deep within
the sacred orb of egypt.

485
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:47,610
Bathe your innermost soul
in the magic flame.

486
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:18,470
Now let the blood
in your veins...

487
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:21,600
intermingle with the blood...

488
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:26,980
of the ancient spirits
of the dark nether world.

489
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:39,750
Behold yourself in the mirror.

490
00:45:39,830 --> 00:45:46,000
Now are you one of
the mystic coven of witches.

491
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:01,250
The court
of His Exalted Majesty...

492
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:04,190
King Mark of Cornwall
is now in session.

493
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:07,020
Let the stranger
approach the throne.

494
00:46:13,730 --> 00:46:15,860
Pendragon.

495
00:46:17,770 --> 00:46:20,530
You dare to come here?

496
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:21,970
Guards!

497
00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:28,440
I detect a chill
in your hospitality...

498
00:46:28,510 --> 00:46:31,540
but perhaps Your Majesty
does not wish to hear...

499
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:34,750
of the whereabouts
of the royal princess.

500
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:38,780
He couldn't possibly
know about Elaine.

501
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:42,080
Approach the throne.

502
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:47,490
Thank you Your Majesty.

503
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:51,860
Speak forth black prince.

504
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:54,570
I merely wish to inform
Your Majesty...

505
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:58,910
that your daughter did not reach
the convent as you planned.

506
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:01,810
What have you done with her?
Where is she?

507
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:05,520
Only I know that.

508
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:08,350
I don't believe you.
You're lying.

509
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:10,450
Do you think so?

510
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:20,190
Behold.

511
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:21,960
Elaine.

512
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:24,970
Elaine.

513
00:47:32,110 --> 00:47:34,410
Do you really think
I am so stupid...

514
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,780
as to bring the girl herself?

515
00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:39,820
That illusion was merely
to prove to you...

516
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:42,580
that I have her in reality.

517
00:47:43,990 --> 00:47:46,980
My daughter...
is she safe?

518
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:50,430
Perfectly. At my castle.

519
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:53,490
What is it that you want of me?

520
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:04,140
My terms are simple...

521
00:48:06,110 --> 00:48:10,780
merely that you abdicate
within a week.

522
00:48:10,850 --> 00:48:13,720
You may take your chancellor and
any aides that you require...

523
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:16,190
and leave England
never to return.

524
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:21,450
But who will rule my country
govern my people? You?

525
00:48:21,530 --> 00:48:23,960
On the contrary.

526
00:48:24,030 --> 00:48:27,400
The next in legal succession
will ascend the throne.

527
00:48:27,470 --> 00:48:29,090
Her coronation
will take place...

528
00:48:29,170 --> 00:48:31,290
immediately after
your abdication.

529
00:48:31,370 --> 00:48:33,530
You mean my daughter
will become queen?

530
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:38,470
You see? My terms are generous
are they not?

531
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:41,140
With you by her side
to advise her.

532
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:43,940
That may be as may be.

533
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:47,420
You have one choice to make
King Mark.

534
00:48:47,490 --> 00:48:50,920
Your daughter or your throne.

535
00:48:50,990 --> 00:48:54,150
In a week I shall return
for your answer.

536
00:48:54,230 --> 00:48:59,390
You hold my daughter witch
but we hold you.

537
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:00,930
Seize him!

538
00:49:07,310 --> 00:49:10,000
One week King Mark...

539
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:12,540
no more.

540
00:49:15,150 --> 00:49:17,050
How could he have known
of our plans?

541
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:19,380
Outside of the two of us...

542
00:49:21,490 --> 00:49:23,390
Lady Constance!

543
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:27,450
Except for
the princess and Jack...

544
00:49:27,530 --> 00:49:29,550
only we three knew
we were sending Elaine away.

545
00:49:29,630 --> 00:49:31,430
Surely
you don't think it was l...

546
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:33,490
- Look into that mirror.
- No no!

547
00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:35,900
According to legend
if you're a witch...

548
00:49:35,970 --> 00:49:40,130
the mirror will reflect
your true soul!

549
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:45,300
All right it was I
who told the master.

550
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:48,840
Break the mirror!
Break the spell!

551
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:02,790
Oh forgive me.

552
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:05,060
I'm sorry I'm sorry.

553
00:50:05,130 --> 00:50:06,560
Forgive me forgive me.

554
00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:09,290
We do not blame you
Constance.

555
00:50:09,370 --> 00:50:10,490
Forgive me.

556
00:50:10,570 --> 00:50:12,230
We pity you.

557
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:14,000
I'm sorry.

558
00:50:14,070 --> 00:50:16,010
I'm sorry.

559
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:28,310
Ahoy on board!

560
00:50:28,390 --> 00:50:29,480
Help!

561
00:50:29,550 --> 00:50:31,040
Ahoy!

562
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:32,520
Help!

563
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:36,530
Strange fish
in the sea today.

564
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:21,010
Here drink.

565
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:26,200
All of it.

566
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:36,080
It's good Sigurd
after it's down.

567
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:40,990
We were trying to remember if
you'd ever seen these witches.

568
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:43,120
Oh the witches.

569
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,180
Yeah.

570
00:51:45,430 --> 00:51:49,370
Ah I sailed these waters
under Eric the Red.

571
00:51:49,430 --> 00:51:53,100
Sailed in fifty ships we did
to conquer Ireland.

572
00:51:53,170 --> 00:51:57,200
Oh it was wonderful...
the fighting the plundering.

573
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,540
Yes but did you ever see
the witches?

574
00:51:59,610 --> 00:52:02,080
Oh the witches the witches.

575
00:52:02,150 --> 00:52:06,740
These old eyes have seen
many strange sights.

576
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:10,020
Once when Eric the Red and I
were sailing south...

577
00:52:10,090 --> 00:52:13,060
we saw a school of dragons
in the sea.

578
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:15,320
Yes but these witches
were in the sky...

579
00:52:15,390 --> 00:52:17,730
and their leader
had three horns on his head.

580
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:19,890
And he carried a pitchfork.

581
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:20,990
A pitchfork.

582
00:52:21,070 --> 00:52:22,590
That shot blue flames.

583
00:52:22,670 --> 00:52:24,260
Blue flames.

584
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:27,960
Sounds like
Tubo the warlock to me...

585
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:30,340
Pendragors witch
from across the sea.

586
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:37,350
- What was that?
- The imp of the bottle.

587
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:40,980
I fished him up
in my nets one day.

588
00:52:41,050 --> 00:52:46,650
He claims to have great powers
but he will do nothing for me.

589
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:49,060
Have a care!
Just a moment!

590
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:53,660
You ugly mean devil!

591
00:52:53,730 --> 00:52:56,630
Couldrt you wait?
I asked for nothing.

592
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:59,830
And nothing you'll get
you murderous Viking.

593
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:02,970
Me power's reserved
for one to me liking.

594
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:05,410
A little toy man.

595
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:07,170
Insulting a leprechaun.

596
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:08,510
A toy you say?

597
00:53:08,580 --> 00:53:11,380
Oh for that there'll be
the devil to pay.

598
00:53:11,450 --> 00:53:13,140
Now hush up and listen.

599
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:17,520
Jack here is a good and true lad
with... with a just cause.

600
00:53:17,590 --> 00:53:19,450
There's a princess to be
rescued from the witches...

601
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:21,550
and I need help.

602
00:53:21,630 --> 00:53:26,360
A noble aim if spoken true.

603
00:53:26,430 --> 00:53:30,090
Pick up the bottle...
I dare you to.

604
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:36,160
A caution...
if you've told a lie...

605
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:39,970
the glass will glow
and your hand will fry.

606
00:53:51,890 --> 00:53:53,950
Faith and after
a thousand years...

607
00:53:54,030 --> 00:53:57,290
at last
an honest man appears.

608
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:59,660
Have you been in there
that long?

609
00:53:59,730 --> 00:54:01,790
He was imprisoned
by the king of elves...

610
00:54:01,870 --> 00:54:05,300
for dabbling in the black arts.

611
00:54:05,370 --> 00:54:09,330
I'd finished me work
me shoes heeled and sewn.

612
00:54:09,410 --> 00:54:14,540
All I did was to make me
these boots out of gold.

613
00:54:14,610 --> 00:54:18,310
Not just boots
seven-league boots.

614
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:21,650
Made out of the old pot of gold
you baboon...

615
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:25,620
to go around the world
and over the moon.

616
00:54:25,690 --> 00:54:27,780
You'll help me then?

617
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:39,230
These magic coins
will aid your mission...

618
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:41,830
if you'll agree
to one condition.

619
00:54:41,910 --> 00:54:45,170
When they're gone
there are only three...

620
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:49,340
you'll smash the glass
and set me free.

621
00:54:49,410 --> 00:54:51,350
It's a bargain then.

622
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:53,850
For his island we'll sail
to twist Pendragors tail

623
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:56,110
And the princess we'll save
from that horrible knave

624
00:54:56,190 --> 00:54:58,180
I'm off on a fling
I'll get out of this thing

625
00:54:58,260 --> 00:55:00,690
A free man I'll be
oh tralura tralee

626
00:55:44,370 --> 00:55:47,430
At least we're here
thanks to the imp.

627
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:50,300
Now to find out
where he's hiding Elaine.

628
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:53,400
You think it wise
for you to go alone?

629
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:55,540
I think there's less chance
of being discovered.

630
00:55:55,610 --> 00:55:57,640
Suppose you're caught Jack?

631
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:59,910
We'll see
if our little friend here...

632
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:02,180
is as good as he says he is.

633
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:04,810
Who led you safely
across the brine?

634
00:56:04,890 --> 00:56:07,220
You do your part
I'll do mine.

635
00:56:11,030 --> 00:56:13,930
I'll put my trust
in that sword.

636
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,400
We'll see.

637
00:56:26,950 --> 00:56:28,810
Remember to put
some fresh water aboard.

638
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:31,250
Be careful Jack.

639
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:33,340
Good luck.

640
00:57:42,050 --> 00:57:44,490
We don't often have visitors.

641
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:46,020
A clever lad.

642
00:57:46,090 --> 00:57:47,990
How would he fair
do you suppose...

643
00:57:48,060 --> 00:57:50,290
against our castle's defenses?

644
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:55,820
It would be a most diverting
spectacle to see.

645
00:59:53,820 --> 00:59:55,790
You cannot fight
these men with stone.

646
00:59:55,850 --> 00:59:59,720
Look about you
seize a bone.

647
00:59:59,790 --> 01:00:01,730
A bone to fight them?

648
01:00:01,790 --> 01:00:04,160
A bone to fight
their magic might.

649
01:00:04,230 --> 01:00:06,460
A bone to get
a fairer fight.

650
01:00:06,530 --> 01:00:09,430
Don't be asking
questions dunce.

651
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:13,370
Seize the bone...
now at once.

652
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:24,110
Thanks imp.

653
01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:26,120
Thank me later
on the ship.

654
01:00:26,180 --> 01:00:28,650
Right now
get cracking with that whip.

655
01:00:48,610 --> 01:00:51,010
A magic whip.

656
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:52,740
This alters things.

657
01:00:52,810 --> 01:00:55,340
He must be dealt with
differently.

658
01:02:39,050 --> 01:02:41,420
Enter lad. Enter.

659
01:02:45,890 --> 01:02:47,920
Don't look back
in that direction.

660
01:02:47,990 --> 01:02:50,520
I'll take care
of your protection.

661
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:05,900
Welcome to castle Pendragon.

662
01:03:05,980 --> 01:03:08,910
I had a sample
of your welcome outside.

663
01:03:08,980 --> 01:03:12,250
I must compliment you
on your valor young man.

664
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:16,340
First you vanquished
Cormoran my giant.

665
01:03:16,420 --> 01:03:19,010
Then you found your way
to this island...

666
01:03:19,090 --> 01:03:21,180
a feat in itself.

667
01:03:21,260 --> 01:03:25,560
And just now you lashed at
and destroyed my dragon men...

668
01:03:25,630 --> 01:03:29,590
with your magic whip...
a stroke of genius.

669
01:03:29,670 --> 01:03:34,930
A real tragedy to have come
so far only to suffer failure.

670
01:03:35,010 --> 01:03:37,630
You're so sure I have failed?

671
01:03:37,710 --> 01:03:40,110
I am indeed.

672
01:03:40,180 --> 01:03:44,270
For you see if you take
one step toward me...

673
01:03:44,350 --> 01:03:47,180
horns will sprout
from your head.

674
01:03:47,250 --> 01:03:51,480
A second step and you will
develop cloven hooves...

675
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:54,020
and walk on all fours.

676
01:03:54,090 --> 01:03:55,850
A third step...

677
01:03:55,930 --> 01:03:58,860
and the transformation
will be complete.

678
01:03:58,930 --> 01:04:02,390
You will have become
a black ram.

679
01:04:02,470 --> 01:04:04,560
So you see?

680
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:07,070
Your sword
can be an antidote...

681
01:04:07,140 --> 01:04:09,070
to givir you a cashmere coat.

682
01:04:09,140 --> 01:04:14,410
Hold it 'fore you as you go
hilt above and point below.

683
01:04:29,190 --> 01:04:30,590
No horns.

684
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:40,570
No hooves.

685
01:04:46,580 --> 01:04:48,140
No wool.

686
01:04:53,250 --> 01:04:54,950
Defeated did you say witch?

687
01:04:55,020 --> 01:04:58,720
Please let us dispense
with theatricalities.

688
01:04:58,790 --> 01:05:02,590
My powers are obviously
completely without effect...

689
01:05:02,660 --> 01:05:04,590
against your own.

690
01:05:04,660 --> 01:05:07,790
Therefore
I yield to the inevitable.

691
01:05:09,370 --> 01:05:14,360
I'm curious how do you acquire
such potent forces?

692
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:17,430
- The princess.
- She is not here.

693
01:05:17,510 --> 01:05:20,070
- Produce her or die.
- She's not in the castle.

694
01:05:20,140 --> 01:05:21,110
Then where?

695
01:05:21,180 --> 01:05:24,410
On the other side
of the island...

696
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:26,970
there are the ruins
of a little Roman temple.

697
01:05:27,050 --> 01:05:28,680
She is imprisoned there.

698
01:05:28,750 --> 01:05:30,350
Have her brought to me at once.

699
01:05:30,420 --> 01:05:32,620
If you wish
to free the princess...

700
01:05:32,690 --> 01:05:34,390
you must go there.

701
01:05:34,460 --> 01:05:37,090
How do I know I can trust you?

702
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:40,560
Arert we rather forced
to trust each other?

703
01:05:40,630 --> 01:05:44,400
There seems no other way.

704
01:05:44,470 --> 01:05:46,160
Very well.

705
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:49,930
But make no attempt
to trick me.

706
01:05:55,610 --> 01:05:57,550
Master your magic...
what's happened?

707
01:05:57,620 --> 01:05:59,780
Princess!

708
01:05:59,850 --> 01:06:03,250
Out of my way you yelping dogs
and let me think.

709
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:05,650
Never have I failed
to turn a mere mortal...

710
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:07,350
into a cringing beast.

711
01:06:07,430 --> 01:06:10,590
But he was able to withstand
the strength of my magic.

712
01:06:10,660 --> 01:06:11,960
It was the sword master.

713
01:06:12,030 --> 01:06:13,220
The burning sword.

714
01:06:13,300 --> 01:06:15,060
It was not only the sword
you fool.

715
01:06:15,130 --> 01:06:17,190
Have you forgotten
the magic whip?

716
01:06:17,270 --> 01:06:20,400
He has a strange power...

717
01:06:20,470 --> 01:06:24,100
perhaps some ancient talisman
of the black arts.

718
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:28,040
We must find the secret
of this power.

719
01:06:28,110 --> 01:06:30,270
Perhaps I can help.

720
01:06:30,350 --> 01:06:32,940
He doesn't know I'm one of you.

721
01:06:33,020 --> 01:06:36,610
Perhaps you can.

722
01:06:36,690 --> 01:06:38,480
- Garna.
- Yes master.

723
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:40,820
Take her to the ruined temple.

724
01:06:40,890 --> 01:06:42,720
Yes master.

725
01:06:42,790 --> 01:06:49,700
There you will appear to him
as the princess Elaine.

726
01:07:28,070 --> 01:07:30,230
Princess. It's all right.

727
01:07:30,310 --> 01:07:31,600
- Jack.
- You're safe now.

728
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:33,770
Dear Jack
I prayed you'd come.

729
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:35,040
I have a boat on the beach...

730
01:07:35,110 --> 01:07:36,810
waiting to take us
back to England.

731
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:37,970
Can you walk?

732
01:07:38,050 --> 01:07:39,950
I'll be all right.

733
01:08:05,910 --> 01:08:07,780
Ahoy Sigurd! Peter!

734
01:08:09,810 --> 01:08:11,180
The cask is gone.

735
01:08:11,250 --> 01:08:13,270
They must still be
looking for water.

736
01:08:14,790 --> 01:08:18,520
Well they'll be
returning soon.

737
01:08:18,590 --> 01:08:21,080
I'd better make ready to sail.

738
01:08:27,870 --> 01:08:30,660
I never thought
I'd see you again Jack...

739
01:08:30,730 --> 01:08:33,170
or that I'd ever leave
this island alive.

740
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:36,330
We had the luck
of the Irish on our side.

741
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:41,730
Surely it would take more
than luck to defeat Pendragon.

742
01:08:41,810 --> 01:08:45,440
Luck and the secret
of my magic weapon.

743
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:47,380
You mean this?

744
01:08:47,450 --> 01:08:49,580
The sword? No.

745
01:08:49,650 --> 01:08:51,750
That's just
Sigurd's rusty old blade.

746
01:08:51,820 --> 01:08:56,190
I was talking about my friend
the imp of the bottle.

747
01:08:58,900 --> 01:09:03,560
He's a leprechaun imprisoned
in the bottle by a magic spell.

748
01:09:04,770 --> 01:09:06,460
We both owe him everything.

749
01:09:06,540 --> 01:09:09,730
Oh such pretty words
you'd better say...

750
01:09:09,810 --> 01:09:12,970
till we are safe
and far away.

751
01:09:14,950 --> 01:09:18,400
Is there something wrong
Princess?

752
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:20,450
I guess...

753
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:22,710
being chained out there
for so long...

754
01:09:22,790 --> 01:09:24,650
I'm cold.

755
01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:26,880
We can wait in the cabin.

756
01:09:38,470 --> 01:09:40,370
This'll warm you.

757
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:44,530
Is there anything...
some hot tea to drink?

758
01:09:44,610 --> 01:09:47,580
Well this brew of Sigurd's...

759
01:09:47,650 --> 01:09:49,170
isn't exactly fit
for a princess...

760
01:09:49,250 --> 01:09:50,370
but it is warming.

761
01:09:50,450 --> 01:09:52,510
I'll pour it.
Get another cup Jack.

762
01:09:52,580 --> 01:09:55,580
We'll drink together
to our escape from this island.

763
01:09:55,650 --> 01:09:58,350
That I will gladly do.

764
01:09:58,420 --> 01:10:01,690
I wish Peter were here
to celebrate with us.

765
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:04,320
Yes and Sigurd too.

766
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:05,990
You'll like him.

767
01:10:06,060 --> 01:10:08,030
Thank you Princess.

768
01:10:08,100 --> 01:10:10,160
To a safe voyage home.

769
01:10:10,230 --> 01:10:11,760
And to us.

770
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:12,270
To a happy future.
You and I together Jack...

771
01:10:12,270 --> 01:10:14,570
To a happy future.
You and I together Jack...

772
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:16,830
for the rest of our lives.

773
01:10:16,910 --> 01:10:18,570
To us.

774
01:10:25,220 --> 01:10:26,620
To us.

775
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:30,610
All right to us.

776
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:38,190
Oh it's strange
to feel happy...

777
01:10:38,260 --> 01:10:41,030
at a time like this
but when we sail...

778
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:45,530
What's the matter Jack?

779
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:47,330
I don't know.

780
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:51,270
Suddenly I feel strange
as if...

781
01:10:51,340 --> 01:10:52,780
I were going to...

782
01:10:54,110 --> 01:10:55,270
Fresh air.

783
01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:15,430
She must be evil
the bottle's hot.

784
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:17,760
She pretends to be
what she is not.

785
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:19,500
Watch it there!

786
01:11:28,310 --> 01:11:29,840
Don't rock the ship!

787
01:11:29,910 --> 01:11:32,040
Saints preserve us
I'm going to slip!

788
01:11:36,490 --> 01:11:38,510
Ahoy on board.

789
01:11:56,210 --> 01:11:57,700
Sigurd!

790
01:11:59,980 --> 01:12:02,640
Jack. Jack!

791
01:12:02,710 --> 01:12:05,050
Sigurd come here quick!

792
01:12:23,330 --> 01:12:27,900
Your imp stands between me
and the throne of Cornwall.

793
01:12:27,970 --> 01:12:29,270
Where is he?

794
01:12:29,340 --> 01:12:31,210
You have great magic powers.

795
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:32,400
Find him yourself.

796
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:35,000
Yes. I will.

797
01:12:39,080 --> 01:12:42,250
Only twice in my existence
have I been thwarted...

798
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:44,310
once by Herla the wizard...

799
01:12:44,390 --> 01:12:46,820
and this second time by you.

800
01:12:46,890 --> 01:12:48,410
Herla is dead.

801
01:12:48,490 --> 01:12:51,930
Yes and I will die too
rather than betray my king.

802
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:56,630
I shall hope to make you
change your mind.

803
01:12:56,700 --> 01:12:57,690
Garna.

804
01:12:57,770 --> 01:12:59,760
Yes master.

805
01:13:15,750 --> 01:13:18,020
Peter. Sigurd.

806
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:30,330
For the last time
where is the imp?

807
01:13:32,870 --> 01:13:34,840
Release the Viking.

808
01:13:40,010 --> 01:13:42,310
I am afraid you were not
sufficiently impressed...

809
01:13:42,380 --> 01:13:44,210
on your first visit.

810
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:47,770
I'll give you a new
demonstration of my powers.

811
01:13:55,690 --> 01:13:57,460
Sigurd!

812
01:13:57,530 --> 01:13:59,290
Now... the boy.

813
01:14:06,370 --> 01:14:07,630
Look at me.

814
01:14:07,700 --> 01:14:09,800
Look at me!

815
01:14:11,070 --> 01:14:12,560
Stop it!

816
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:14,800
Jack!

817
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:16,640
Peter!

818
01:14:16,710 --> 01:14:18,010
Wait!

819
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:21,480
Jack tell him please!

820
01:14:21,550 --> 01:14:24,320
I can't.

821
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:34,160
Look at me.

822
01:14:39,900 --> 01:14:41,840
Peter! Peter!

823
01:14:45,010 --> 01:14:48,840
And now my dear
you are next.

824
01:14:58,390 --> 01:15:01,980
What do you suppose
would be most fitting?

825
01:15:02,060 --> 01:15:03,820
A serpent?

826
01:15:03,890 --> 01:15:06,360
Or perhaps a toad?

827
01:15:06,430 --> 01:15:11,600
Or would you prefer to tell me
where you have hid the imp?

828
01:15:13,540 --> 01:15:17,030
Your loyalty to your king
is touching...

829
01:15:17,110 --> 01:15:21,270
but your allegiance to
the princess is another matter.

830
01:15:24,580 --> 01:15:27,020
You have...

831
01:15:27,080 --> 01:15:31,210
you have until
these sands run out...

832
01:15:31,290 --> 01:15:35,380
to convince your knight
that he is being most unwise.

833
01:15:45,370 --> 01:15:47,000
Garna.

834
01:15:49,410 --> 01:15:53,040
I advise you
consider carefully.

835
01:16:00,750 --> 01:16:03,150
Please Jack tell him
where you hid the imp.

836
01:16:03,220 --> 01:16:05,350
You've got to to save us all.

837
01:16:05,420 --> 01:16:08,290
Is that why you drugged me
to get the imp?

838
01:16:08,360 --> 01:16:09,950
I did it to save your life.

839
01:16:10,030 --> 01:16:11,820
He threatened to kill you
if I refused.

840
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:13,560
He was watching every move.

841
01:16:13,630 --> 01:16:16,500
He'll kill you now if you don't
tell him where you hid the imp.

842
01:16:16,570 --> 01:16:20,970
Then I'll have to die because
I don't know where the imp is.

843
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:23,130
You really don't know?

844
01:16:23,210 --> 01:16:24,870
It's the truth Princess.

845
01:16:24,940 --> 01:16:27,000
I don't know.

846
01:16:30,710 --> 01:16:33,550
You were a fool
to come here Jack.

847
01:16:33,620 --> 01:16:37,310
Your fate was sealed the moment
you set foot on this island.

848
01:16:37,390 --> 01:16:40,290
The only thing that kept
you alive was the imp.

849
01:16:42,060 --> 01:16:46,960
As soon as the master returns
you die all of you.

850
01:16:47,030 --> 01:16:50,430
Princess you are bewitched.

851
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:52,700
Break the mirror
before it's too late.

852
01:16:52,770 --> 01:16:54,600
Break the spell
he cast over you.

853
01:16:57,910 --> 01:17:00,780
Untie me!
Help me before it's too late!

854
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:05,910
And what would you save me from
Prince Charming...

855
01:17:05,980 --> 01:17:07,710
my reflection?

856
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:11,680
Look at me.

857
01:17:12,990 --> 01:17:15,080
Gaze upon my true self.

858
01:17:15,160 --> 01:17:19,190
Am I not beautiful?

859
01:17:19,260 --> 01:17:21,130
Why be the princess
of Cornwall...

860
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:24,460
when I can be queen
of all England?

861
01:17:24,530 --> 01:17:26,900
Think of it.

862
01:17:26,970 --> 01:17:29,130
How exciting.

863
01:17:29,210 --> 01:17:32,540
A witch on the throne
of England.

864
01:17:37,780 --> 01:17:39,870
I forgot.

865
01:17:41,950 --> 01:17:44,750
Pity you won't be there.

866
01:17:47,290 --> 01:17:48,380
Peter! Peter!

867
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:53,020
That's right.

868
01:17:53,100 --> 01:17:54,790
Come over here and untie me.

869
01:17:54,870 --> 01:17:56,490
Over here!
Untie me quickly!

870
01:17:56,570 --> 01:17:57,830
No!

871
01:17:57,900 --> 01:17:59,370
No!

872
01:18:01,710 --> 01:18:03,830
No!

873
01:18:03,910 --> 01:18:06,400
Get away from there.
Get back in your cage.

874
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:08,170
Please let him be!

875
01:18:13,980 --> 01:18:15,080
Master!

876
01:18:15,150 --> 01:18:16,680
Pendragon help!

877
01:18:16,750 --> 01:18:19,090
Help me! Pendragon!

878
01:18:20,420 --> 01:18:22,390
Master!

879
01:18:22,460 --> 01:18:24,390
Help me!

880
01:18:24,460 --> 01:18:27,830
Help! Master!

881
01:18:29,100 --> 01:18:30,530
Master! No!

882
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:32,230
No! Master!

883
01:18:32,300 --> 01:18:33,360
No please!

884
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:34,600
No!

885
01:18:34,670 --> 01:18:35,900
Sorry Princess.

886
01:18:35,970 --> 01:18:37,800
Master!

887
01:18:52,290 --> 01:18:53,880
Forgive me.

888
01:18:53,960 --> 01:18:56,790
Forgive me.

889
01:18:58,160 --> 01:18:59,390
Garna quickly.

890
01:18:59,460 --> 01:19:01,620
Pendragon.

891
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:20,780
Master the cage...
it's empty too.

892
01:19:20,850 --> 01:19:23,650
This would explain it.

893
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:53,940
Flaming gauntlets live.

894
01:19:58,190 --> 01:19:59,520
Fight.

895
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:14,660
Wait.

896
01:20:14,740 --> 01:20:16,670
There's a secret passage
out of the castle this way.

897
01:20:16,740 --> 01:20:18,540
Hurry.

898
01:20:18,610 --> 01:20:21,630
No matter.
They cannot reach the boat.

899
01:20:55,110 --> 01:20:58,050
Jack! Jack! Come back!

900
01:21:00,680 --> 01:21:03,240
The boat is just beyond
those rocks.

901
01:21:11,830 --> 01:21:13,800
Run for the rocks.

902
01:21:18,900 --> 01:21:22,130
It's a matter
of a few moments now.

903
01:21:45,700 --> 01:21:47,630
At least we're safe in here.

904
01:21:47,700 --> 01:21:49,490
Not at high tide.

905
01:22:12,020 --> 01:22:15,320
Ahoy there you
whoever you be!

906
01:22:15,390 --> 01:22:18,260
Get me out of
this boilir sea!

907
01:22:29,910 --> 01:22:32,900
The imp.
Peter give it to me quick.

908
01:22:36,310 --> 01:22:37,970
Hurry imp
your last good deed.

909
01:22:38,050 --> 01:22:39,070
Do it now.

910
01:22:39,150 --> 01:22:40,670
Please hurry.

911
01:22:40,750 --> 01:22:43,280
Beware of her.
She'll change your features...

912
01:22:43,350 --> 01:22:45,080
like she did
those other creatures.

913
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:47,060
She was under
Pendragors spell...

914
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:50,390
but it's broken now.
Hurry! Your magic!

915
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:56,860
In all the kingdom
under the sea...

916
01:22:56,930 --> 01:22:59,560
there's just one creature
might set you free.

917
01:22:59,640 --> 01:23:01,900
Well throw the coin.
Call him.

918
01:25:38,360 --> 01:25:41,190
Master they're making
for the boat.

919
01:25:42,530 --> 01:25:44,160
Out of my way!

920
01:26:09,290 --> 01:26:11,850
Master they're escaping!

921
01:26:15,030 --> 01:26:16,460
Give me room!

922
01:27:03,650 --> 01:27:06,050
Can't you help us
just once more?

923
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:09,780
Oh I would if I could
but you've had your three.

924
01:27:11,420 --> 01:27:14,080
Look at me purse.
It is empty see?

925
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:38,310
No! Jack!

926
01:28:38,370 --> 01:28:40,370
Jack help!

927
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:43,000
Jack! Jack!

928
01:30:50,840 --> 01:30:52,030
Jack!

929
01:30:53,580 --> 01:30:54,770
Jack?

930
01:30:56,750 --> 01:30:58,580
Peter. Sigurd.

931
01:30:58,650 --> 01:30:59,980
How wonderful.

932
01:31:00,050 --> 01:31:03,250
- Jack come on!
- Come on!

933
01:31:03,320 --> 01:31:04,750
- Come on.
- Come on.

934
01:31:04,820 --> 01:31:06,550
Come on.

935
01:31:06,620 --> 01:31:07,880
Sigurd.

936
01:31:15,130 --> 01:31:18,260
Ahh Peter
you're restored too.

937
01:31:18,330 --> 01:31:21,360
When you killed Pendragon
it broke the spell over us.

938
01:31:21,440 --> 01:31:22,930
And look at his castle.

939
01:31:23,010 --> 01:31:25,100
Destroyed forever.

940
01:31:27,610 --> 01:31:30,100
You'll find dry clothes
in the cabin.

941
01:31:30,180 --> 01:31:31,650
Just a minute.

942
01:31:31,710 --> 01:31:33,580
I have a promise to fulfill.

943
01:31:33,650 --> 01:31:35,210
You got a hammer?

944
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:36,950
Here. See?

945
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:44,020
Be careful. Don't hurt him.

946
01:31:45,930 --> 01:31:48,230
Will you be still
and calm your fears?

947
01:31:48,300 --> 01:31:51,630
I've been waitir
ten hundred years.

948
01:31:51,700 --> 01:31:53,900
Now watch the glass.

949
01:31:53,970 --> 01:31:56,200
Just a minute.
Have a care.

950
01:31:56,270 --> 01:31:59,670
The bottle...
turn it give me air!

951
01:31:59,740 --> 01:32:01,210
Sorry I was only...

952
01:32:01,280 --> 01:32:03,250
Never mind the lame excuse!

953
01:32:03,310 --> 01:32:06,440
Break the glass
and then let me loose!

954
01:32:10,350 --> 01:32:13,050
Little imp you're free!

955
01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:16,560
Free at last
to breathe and bend...

956
01:32:16,630 --> 01:32:19,220
thanks to you
me noble friend.

957
01:32:20,660 --> 01:32:22,930
For you Elaine
some sound advice.

958
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:26,160
Opportunity knocks
but never twice.

959
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:28,200
So if it's happiness
you'd woo...

960
01:32:28,270 --> 01:32:30,600
marry Jack.
He's the lad for you.

961
01:32:30,670 --> 01:32:33,140
I intend to.

962
01:32:35,480 --> 01:32:38,240
The little people
are waitir for me...

963
01:32:38,310 --> 01:32:41,080
in Ireland there
across the sea.

964
01:32:41,150 --> 01:32:46,950
Ah it is a beautiful place
the fairest of fair...

965
01:32:47,020 --> 01:32:49,290
and me seven-league boots
will get me there.

966
01:32:49,360 --> 01:32:53,390
So bless you all
and have no fear.

967
01:32:53,460 --> 01:32:56,450
Your course for home
will soon be clear.

968
01:32:59,540 --> 01:33:00,930
He's gone.

969
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,470
What did he mean
about our course?

970
01:33:03,540 --> 01:33:06,980
Look! Over there in the sky!

971
01:33:10,780 --> 01:33:13,110
If your homeward way
you'd wend...

972
01:33:13,180 --> 01:33:16,350
follow the rainbow
to its end.

973
01:33:18,050 --> 01:33:19,250
- Good-bye imp!
- Good-bye imp!

974
01:33:19,320 --> 01:33:20,310
Good luck!

975
01:33:20,390 --> 01:33:22,450
He was a loyal friend.
I'll miss him.

976
01:33:22,530 --> 01:33:26,090
Uh come boy
we must get on our course.

977
01:33:34,740 --> 01:33:37,900
She doesn't answer
to the helm very well.

978
01:33:37,970 --> 01:33:42,270
Oh she will do
to get us back to England.

979
01:33:42,350 --> 01:33:46,280
To England... and home.
