1
00:00:14,864 --> 00:00:15,853
DAY FOR NlGHT

2
00:00:15,999 --> 00:00:18,433
Let's all be quiet and play well.

3
00:00:26,409 --> 00:00:29,469
Slowly and relaxed, in my tempo....

4
00:00:32,982 --> 00:00:34,973
From the beginning....

5
00:00:36,052 --> 00:00:39,215
Strike up together....

6
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,985
Here you can speed up....

7
00:00:50,934 --> 00:00:54,392
Don't leave any gaps....

8
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:59,442
There, now all together....

9
00:01:21,965 --> 00:01:24,263
Hold that last chord....

10
00:01:31,908 --> 00:01:34,103
No sentimentality.

11
00:01:34,244 --> 00:01:36,041
Just play the notes.

12
00:01:47,056 --> 00:01:50,048
This film is dedicated
to Lillian and Dorothy Gish

13
00:02:55,959 --> 00:02:57,290
Cut!

14
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:02,197
Everyone over here, please!

15
00:03:03,366 --> 00:03:05,425
We'll do it again, right away!

16
00:03:08,972 --> 00:03:11,941
What happened
coming out of the subway?

17
00:03:12,075 --> 00:03:13,906
Last time it was better.

18
00:03:14,043 --> 00:03:16,603
The bus was two seconds late.

19
00:03:16,746 --> 00:03:19,943
The background activity
was late too.

20
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:22,449
By the beauty parlor...

21
00:03:22,585 --> 00:03:25,850
...a lady was supposed to come out.

22
00:03:26,155 --> 00:03:28,680
l never saw the cyclist go by,
either.

23
00:03:28,825 --> 00:03:31,623
We'll do it again.

24
00:03:32,028 --> 00:03:35,361
What went wrong was the beginning...

25
00:03:35,498 --> 00:03:37,159
...coming out of the subway.

26
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:41,904
Everyone came out together,
then there was no one.

27
00:03:42,071 --> 00:03:46,565
Note start and end footages,
circle the good takes....

28
00:03:46,743 --> 00:03:49,337
-Who do you give it to?
-Yourself!

29
00:03:49,545 --> 00:03:50,876
You mean, l keep it?

30
00:03:51,047 --> 00:03:52,514
Kill that arc!

31
00:03:54,217 --> 00:03:58,677
Ladies and gentlemen, here we are
at the Victorine Studios, in Nice...

32
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:02,951
...where shooting starts today
on Meet Pamela.

33
00:04:03,259 --> 00:04:07,593
But today you won't meet Pamela!

34
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:11,962
The Hollywood star, Julie Baker,
who plays Pamela...

35
00:04:12,101 --> 00:04:14,763
...is expected soon,
but hasn't arrived yet.

36
00:04:14,904 --> 00:04:18,067
But the other stars are here...

37
00:04:18,207 --> 00:04:21,005
...and l hope
to interview them shortly.

38
00:04:21,144 --> 00:04:23,977
lt'll be swollen for weeks,
but don't worry about it!

39
00:04:25,048 --> 00:04:27,414
Meet our male lead.

40
00:04:28,918 --> 00:04:29,976
Mr. Bertrand!

41
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:32,848
You're the producer,
come and talk to us!

42
00:04:32,989 --> 00:04:35,514
A producer should stay out of sight.

43
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:39,184
lt's the story of an older man...

44
00:04:39,662 --> 00:04:43,496
...whose son brings home
an English bride.

45
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,800
lt's the story of a young man
who marries an English girl.

46
00:04:47,937 --> 00:04:52,567
Three months later he brings her
to his parents' Riviera home.

47
00:04:52,775 --> 00:04:57,735
My character falls in love with his
daughter-in-law, and she with him.

48
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,246
She falls in love
with her father-in-law.

49
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:04,444
The movie tells the story
of their illicit love affair.

50
00:05:04,587 --> 00:05:05,679
What happens?

51
00:05:05,822 --> 00:05:10,816
As in any tragedy, each character
must fulfill his destiny.

52
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,961
Excuse me,
they need me on the set.

53
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:15,961
Pamela 1 , Take 4!

54
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:22,228
The bus!

55
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:27,903
Newsvendor, be livelier!

56
00:05:36,686 --> 00:05:38,711
The lady with the dog, faster!

57
00:05:38,855 --> 00:05:41,688
More activity around the subway!

58
00:05:41,891 --> 00:05:43,984
Now the white car!

59
00:05:45,628 --> 00:05:47,858
Alphonse, get ready!

60
00:05:47,997 --> 00:05:49,965
Come out of the subway!

61
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:55,332
Faster!

62
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:59,870
Cafe terrace, more activity!

63
00:06:02,178 --> 00:06:04,669
Lady with the dog, keep going!

64
00:06:06,849 --> 00:06:08,282
Red car!

65
00:06:09,152 --> 00:06:11,279
Faster, red car!

66
00:06:11,687 --> 00:06:13,678
Red car, drive off!

67
00:06:13,823 --> 00:06:18,192
Ready, Walter?
Move in on Alexander.

68
00:06:18,327 --> 00:06:20,261
Move in closer!

69
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:26,232
Cut!
We'll do it from another angle.

70
00:06:26,369 --> 00:06:27,461
Roll it!

71
00:06:28,404 --> 00:06:29,632
Take 2....

72
00:06:32,341 --> 00:06:33,535
Cut!

73
00:06:34,444 --> 00:06:36,412
The last one was good.

74
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:41,310
Places, everyone! Once more!

75
00:06:45,288 --> 00:06:46,550
Let's go!

76
00:07:16,219 --> 00:07:18,210
This is the Atlantic Hotel.

77
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:19,946
In Nice.
Hold on, please.

78
00:07:20,089 --> 00:07:24,617
l have a bathtub, l wanted a shower.
Can l change rooms?

79
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:28,719
-Mine's a shower, l want a tub!
-We can trade!

80
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:31,766
Come on, let's go up! Great!

81
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:46,511
Julie's pictures!

82
00:07:46,649 --> 00:07:48,116
Okay, Joelle.

83
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:56,089
-Julie's pictures....
-Thanks, Odile.

84
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:59,160
Walter, have a look.
The pictures of Julie.

85
00:07:59,295 --> 00:08:03,425
l remember her in that movie
with the car-chase.

86
00:08:04,133 --> 00:08:06,158
Didn't she freak out once?

87
00:08:06,302 --> 00:08:09,499
A minor depression. Over a year ago!

88
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:11,834
She walked out of a production!

89
00:08:11,974 --> 00:08:14,909
Yes, but now she's married
to her doctor.

90
00:08:15,044 --> 00:08:17,512
She must be fine now.

91
00:08:17,647 --> 00:08:19,171
ls Bertrand worried?

92
00:08:19,315 --> 00:08:20,942
l don't think so.

93
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,551
That's a good likeness.
She's lovely.

94
00:08:23,686 --> 00:08:26,416
-Any with her hair short?
-Here's the wig.

95
00:08:26,556 --> 00:08:29,525
-lt's too dark.
-Could be lighter....

96
00:08:29,659 --> 00:08:32,287
She'll wear a wig in Pamela.

97
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:34,362
She has lovely eyes.

98
00:08:34,497 --> 00:08:37,466
Yes, they're light green.

99
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,431
Looks just like her mother!

100
00:08:39,569 --> 00:08:43,471
Good face, nice shape to it.
So pleasant....

101
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:47,702
Here's a good one!
She looks sad, but sexy.

102
00:08:47,877 --> 00:08:50,675
Excuse me, sir.
l'd like to show you the....

103
00:08:50,813 --> 00:08:53,179
Sure, Bernard, show it to us.

104
00:08:53,316 --> 00:08:55,841
The trick candle
for the costume party.

105
00:08:55,985 --> 00:08:58,954
Plugging it in, turns it on.
Got a light?

106
00:08:59,088 --> 00:09:02,683
lf the actress keeps
it toward her face...

107
00:09:02,825 --> 00:09:05,851
...the light seems
to come from the candle!

108
00:09:05,995 --> 00:09:09,328
She mustn't turn the candle
toward the camera...

109
00:09:09,532 --> 00:09:11,898
...or it'll give away the trick.

110
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:17,196
-Okay?
-Okay, Bernard. Sold.

111
00:09:18,241 --> 00:09:19,503
And the wire goes...?

112
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:22,543
ln the sleeve and down the dress.

113
00:09:22,778 --> 00:09:24,837
Look at this vase!

114
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:27,541
Not bad for a hotel vase.

115
00:09:27,683 --> 00:09:32,416
l'd like to see it in Severine's
dining room. ln the movie!

116
00:09:32,555 --> 00:09:35,183
-lt's cracked!
-Just swipe it!

117
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:43,623
Hi, Liliane. Hi, Alphonse.

118
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,758
These are for you!

119
00:09:45,901 --> 00:09:47,960
Thanks for the trainee job.

120
00:09:48,104 --> 00:09:50,868
Think you'll like
being a script girl?

121
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:54,408
lt's hard to say,
after one day!

122
00:09:54,543 --> 00:09:59,003
-lt's a terrific job, you'll see.
-l'll let you know in two months.

123
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:01,081
Right.... So long, kids.

124
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:05,176
You didn't tell me he was stone deaf!

125
00:10:05,488 --> 00:10:09,447
So what? Happened in the army.
Artillery fire!

126
00:10:11,927 --> 00:10:13,519
Do me a favor.

127
00:10:13,729 --> 00:10:16,459
Walk ahead,
so l can watch your ass.

128
00:10:16,599 --> 00:10:18,032
Like this?

129
00:10:18,601 --> 00:10:20,364
Yes, like that!

130
00:10:40,356 --> 00:10:42,290
-l saw you!
-Saw me what?

131
00:10:42,425 --> 00:10:44,825
-You're hot for the maid.
-l am?

132
00:10:45,094 --> 00:10:46,220
Bastard!

133
00:10:46,362 --> 00:10:49,695
She's your type.
A bouncy little duckling.

134
00:10:49,999 --> 00:10:52,467
Don't tell me you're jealous!

135
00:10:52,601 --> 00:10:56,162
Absolutely not!
Jealousy is dumb.

136
00:10:56,305 --> 00:10:58,671
Or you have to go all the way...

137
00:10:58,808 --> 00:11:00,207
...and commit murder!

138
00:11:00,343 --> 00:11:02,174
You're the jealous type.

139
00:11:02,945 --> 00:11:05,345
l can tell. Your eyebrows meet.

140
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:08,140
My eyebrows meet?

141
00:11:08,551 --> 00:11:10,212
No, they don't!

142
00:11:10,853 --> 00:11:15,722
Those two beds look lonely,
maybe they should meet.

143
00:11:15,858 --> 00:11:18,088
We have to move the table.

144
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:21,021
You could've asked for a double bed!

145
00:11:21,163 --> 00:11:25,759
lt meant asking Lajoie,
the new production manager.

146
00:11:28,537 --> 00:11:30,164
lt's heavy!

147
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:36,041
There.

148
00:11:36,712 --> 00:11:38,270
Now the second!

149
00:11:43,986 --> 00:11:46,819
lt's tougher than moving audiences!

150
00:11:48,224 --> 00:11:49,851
What'll we do tonight?

151
00:11:49,992 --> 00:11:53,291
Pierrot, the stills man,
gave me a list...

152
00:11:53,662 --> 00:11:57,029
...of great little restaurants
up in the hills.

153
00:11:57,233 --> 00:11:59,326
''Great little restaurants'' !

154
00:12:00,202 --> 00:12:02,432
We have to eat, don't we?

155
00:12:02,772 --> 00:12:07,106
You must be kidding!
This town has 37 movie theaters!

156
00:12:07,243 --> 00:12:11,509
We look in the papers, pick a movie,
go there...

157
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,672
...and make sure
when it starts.

158
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:17,343
And if there's time,
we grab a sandwich.

159
00:12:20,623 --> 00:12:24,525
Your stills man can take his list...

160
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,151
...of cute little ''bistros'' ...

161
00:12:27,296 --> 00:12:28,627
...and shove it!

162
00:12:29,265 --> 00:12:30,823
You're impossible!

163
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:36,770
Listen, tonight, l'm not going to
a movie or eating in this hotel.

164
00:12:36,906 --> 00:12:38,032
You decide.

165
00:12:38,607 --> 00:12:41,269
Okay, we'll do what you want.

166
00:12:41,944 --> 00:12:43,411
But on one condition!

167
00:12:43,546 --> 00:12:45,104
Which is?

168
00:12:58,894 --> 00:13:00,725
That you marry me.

169
00:13:07,002 --> 00:13:10,267
Odile, try this on.
lt's for your scene.

170
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,304
Hold that. Not bad, huh?

171
00:13:14,443 --> 00:13:16,001
Let's see the apron.

172
00:13:17,346 --> 00:13:19,337
-Sold?
-l buy it.

173
00:13:20,983 --> 00:13:24,578
Shooting a movie is like
a stagecoach ride in the Old West.

174
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,585
At first you hope for a nice trip.

175
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:29,885
Soon you just hope
to reach your destination!

176
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:35,754
Excuse me for bothering you, sir. l'm
the new production manager, Lajoie.

177
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:40,961
About the car for Pamela's accident.
You have to choose one.

178
00:13:41,103 --> 00:13:43,037
One of those two?

179
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:47,236
Can the white one be painted blue?

180
00:13:47,376 --> 00:13:49,640
Sure, for $650!

181
00:13:49,778 --> 00:13:53,236
Just to paint it blue?
We'll use it as it is!

182
00:13:53,382 --> 00:13:55,316
But it is very white....

183
00:13:56,285 --> 00:13:58,446
What about that blue one?

184
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:01,681
lt belongs to your assistant,
Jean-François!

185
00:14:01,824 --> 00:14:04,622
Maybe he won't mind.

186
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,251
-l'll ask him.
-Yes, do that.

187
00:14:07,396 --> 00:14:08,988
What is a film director?

188
00:14:09,131 --> 00:14:12,931
Someone who's asked questions
about everything.

189
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:17,170
Sometimes he knows the answers.

190
00:14:17,306 --> 00:14:21,333
-You liked this location?
-lt was fine. You were right.

191
00:14:21,477 --> 00:14:24,105
We were lucky too. Great weather!

192
00:14:24,246 --> 00:14:26,646
-Want to see the bungalow?
-Sure, let's go!

193
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:29,444
lt's not built yet.
Just the sketches.

194
00:14:30,486 --> 00:14:32,613
The interior will be furnished.

195
00:14:32,755 --> 00:14:35,986
Bed, night tables,
chairs, table with--

196
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:39,959
Hold on!
The camera will never go inside.

197
00:14:40,095 --> 00:14:42,893
We'll only shoot
through the window.

198
00:14:43,032 --> 00:14:46,399
So all we'll ever see is the bed.

199
00:14:53,275 --> 00:14:55,607
Sorry to bother you, but....

200
00:14:55,744 --> 00:14:58,770
The Americans insist
on the original schedule.

201
00:14:58,914 --> 00:15:00,882
You only have seven weeks.

202
00:15:01,917 --> 00:15:06,251
-Think you can do it?
-lt won't be easy.

203
00:15:06,388 --> 00:15:09,551
lf you need three or four days
for pick-up shots...

204
00:15:09,692 --> 00:15:11,751
...we'll use a skeleton crew.

205
00:15:12,227 --> 00:15:16,061
But the actors
must be released by Oct. 31 st.

206
00:15:16,198 --> 00:15:19,998
l'll go over the schedule
with Jean-François.

207
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:25,070
Seven weeks.
Five days a week. 35 days!

208
00:15:25,207 --> 00:15:27,698
I can't shoot this script
in 35 days.

209
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:31,745
Can you look at this?
lt's Severine's wig....

210
00:15:34,316 --> 00:15:39,515
-lsn't it a little too light?
-Too light? l really don't know.

211
00:15:39,655 --> 00:15:42,453
Tell Joelle to see Walter about it.

212
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:45,856
He's the cameraman, they can decide.

213
00:15:45,995 --> 00:15:48,429
Props wants to see you.

214
00:15:53,569 --> 00:15:58,734
Which gun do you like
for the final scene?

215
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:01,308
Alphonse has small hands.

216
00:16:01,443 --> 00:16:06,574
But we won't take the smallest....
This one!

217
00:16:06,849 --> 00:16:09,909
Pamela crew,
report to screening room.

218
00:16:11,086 --> 00:16:12,553
Here they are!

219
00:16:14,023 --> 00:16:17,789
Rank and file all present
and accounted for? Good!

220
00:16:17,926 --> 00:16:20,520
You'd be lost without
the rank and file!

221
00:16:20,663 --> 00:16:22,654
What rushes are we seeing?

222
00:16:22,798 --> 00:16:25,062
Severine and Alphonse....

223
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,601
-And the crowd scene?
-lt didn't come in.

224
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:32,798
That's strange.
The crowd scene's missing.

225
00:16:32,941 --> 00:16:36,206
Call and ask the lab in Paris.

226
00:16:36,345 --> 00:16:37,403
lt's Scene 1 .

227
00:16:37,613 --> 00:16:40,013
Go ahead....
Wait! Where's Severine?

228
00:16:40,149 --> 00:16:42,447
She never comes to rushes.

229
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:51,922
-Where's Alexander?
-At the airport, as usual.

230
00:16:52,061 --> 00:16:55,053
He goes every day!
He must be expecting someone.

231
00:16:55,197 --> 00:16:57,256
l bet he has personal problems.

232
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:03,937
Mother, I have to talk to you.

233
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:06,599
It's about them, do you mind?

234
00:17:06,809 --> 00:17:08,606
-Yes!
-I have to!

235
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:11,769
I've found out they're in Paris.

236
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:14,272
They're not even hiding.

237
00:17:15,818 --> 00:17:18,446
Why torture yourself?

238
00:17:18,587 --> 00:17:22,421
Be like me. Don't think about them.

239
00:17:22,558 --> 00:17:24,219
That's all I think about.

240
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:28,887
Let's go away.
Just the two of us, far away.

241
00:17:29,031 --> 00:17:31,431
We'll do whatever you want.

242
00:17:36,405 --> 00:17:39,897
I've made up my mind
to go to Paris...

243
00:17:40,075 --> 00:17:41,736
...to kill them both!

244
00:18:01,864 --> 00:18:04,389
Use the ''not even hiding''
from Take 3.

245
00:18:36,131 --> 00:18:38,065
We've got a big problem.

246
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,293
A power failure at the lab.

247
00:18:40,435 --> 00:18:44,735
lt ruined the crowd scene,
it has to be re-shot.

248
00:18:45,274 --> 00:18:48,209
-When can you do it?
-Day after tomorrow.

249
00:18:48,343 --> 00:18:51,835
Not before Monday!
We have to round up 1 50 extras!

250
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:54,778
-The insurance?
-l presume we're covered.

251
00:18:54,917 --> 00:18:59,479
The way to make money today
is in real estate, not movies!

252
00:18:59,621 --> 00:19:01,714
l stay in it because l love it....

253
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:11,195
lf we have to re-shoot the scene,
we will.

254
00:19:14,603 --> 00:19:16,571
How are you, Alexander?

255
00:19:16,705 --> 00:19:20,163
-That's nice. ls it for me?
-No, it's not.

256
00:19:20,309 --> 00:19:22,641
Lajoie, our production manager.

257
00:19:22,778 --> 00:19:25,838
-What's that?
-A bouquet for Madame Severine.

258
00:19:25,981 --> 00:19:29,439
Wrapped in newspaper?
Go wrap it properly!

259
00:19:30,886 --> 00:19:32,444
Tell me....

260
00:19:33,622 --> 00:19:36,090
Does Severine know
l play her husband?

261
00:19:36,225 --> 00:19:39,092
Of course. She was delighted.

262
00:19:40,162 --> 00:19:41,288
That's good.

263
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,761
Go say hello to her.

264
00:19:42,898 --> 00:19:44,991
Where's her dressing room?

265
00:20:05,721 --> 00:20:07,916
l'm so happy to see you!

266
00:20:08,056 --> 00:20:09,614
Gorgeous as ever!

267
00:20:09,758 --> 00:20:15,128
What about you?
How do you keep so young?

268
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:21,700
-l'm delighted to work with you.
-So am l!

269
00:20:21,837 --> 00:20:24,601
Remember when we first met
in Hollywood?

270
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:30,372
No dates! Never mention numbers!

271
00:20:30,512 --> 00:20:33,310
Or l'll tell everyone
you had a facelift!

272
00:20:33,448 --> 00:20:35,575
Not yet. lt's coming!

273
00:20:36,518 --> 00:20:39,078
You know what? For you...

274
00:20:39,221 --> 00:20:42,247
...l might take up cooking again!

275
00:20:42,391 --> 00:20:45,758
Remember how you loved
my risotto Milanese?

276
00:20:45,894 --> 00:20:48,089
Well, l don't anymore!

277
00:20:48,964 --> 00:20:53,162
Just kidding!
l'll eat your risotto any time!

278
00:20:53,302 --> 00:20:57,295
-Are we working together today?
-No, it's you and Alphonse.

279
00:20:57,439 --> 00:20:59,873
l'm going to the airport.
See you.

280
00:21:02,644 --> 00:21:05,135
lsn't he adorable?

281
00:21:08,317 --> 00:21:10,615
When did l work with him...?

282
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:14,083
20 years ago, in Hollywood!

283
00:21:14,222 --> 00:21:17,020
We were there at the same time.

284
00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:19,719
You know, he was a real ladies' man.

285
00:21:21,496 --> 00:21:25,057
ln Hollywood, they called him....

286
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,794
-l loved him too.
-ls he married?

287
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:29,833
l don't know if he is now.

288
00:21:29,972 --> 00:21:35,604
He was married and divorced twice.
Maybe he lives with someone.

289
00:21:35,744 --> 00:21:38,577
No one knows. He's very secretive.

290
00:21:38,981 --> 00:21:42,007
He has a moustache in the movie.
l like it.

291
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:46,314
Moustache or not,
he's still playing lovers!

292
00:21:46,455 --> 00:21:51,415
And look at me....
l'm only cast as the neglected wife!

293
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:55,087
Desperate...tragic...a real pain....

294
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,357
-You're lovely!
-No way....

295
00:21:57,766 --> 00:22:00,633
Cue me for my scene today.

296
00:22:00,769 --> 00:22:03,329
l can't remember a line!

297
00:22:04,706 --> 00:22:08,005
For some reason, lately...

298
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:11,507
...my memory has gone to hell.

299
00:22:22,991 --> 00:22:25,221
Excellent dressing room.

300
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,319
Nice and spacious.
Only the flowers are missing.

301
00:22:29,464 --> 00:22:31,489
They've been ordered.

302
00:22:31,633 --> 00:22:34,727
You know,
l admire Julie Baker as much as you.

303
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:36,701
You wanted her, we got her!

304
00:22:36,838 --> 00:22:39,602
But if she has a breakdown,
we've had it!

305
00:22:39,741 --> 00:22:40,901
What do you mean?

306
00:22:41,043 --> 00:22:45,275
After the medical exam,
the doctor refused to insure her.

307
00:22:45,414 --> 00:22:50,351
Said she's still too nervous, and we
should postpone the shoot for a month!

308
00:22:50,485 --> 00:22:52,749
What did the Americans say?

309
00:22:52,888 --> 00:22:56,324
They're more flexible
than the French.

310
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:58,756
They're gambling with us.

311
00:22:58,894 --> 00:23:02,125
But if we lose,
no one'll take the blame.

312
00:23:02,264 --> 00:23:03,993
We'll all be in hot water!

313
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:07,761
You have to trust
your luck sometimes....

314
00:23:07,903 --> 00:23:09,530
You're right.

315
00:23:10,505 --> 00:23:12,302
Still, it's a gamble!

316
00:23:13,108 --> 00:23:16,874
-Seen Severine since the rushes?
-l went to say hello.

317
00:23:17,012 --> 00:23:20,175
You know she had
an affair with Alexander?

318
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:23,182
-l heard....
-Very stormy.

319
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:25,252
Lots of publicity!

320
00:23:25,387 --> 00:23:27,218
lt ended badly.

321
00:23:27,355 --> 00:23:32,588
For four years, no producer
could get them to work together.

322
00:23:32,727 --> 00:23:34,456
They hated each other!

323
00:23:34,596 --> 00:23:38,032
But time heals all wounds.

324
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:41,329
-Hello, Alphonse!
-Got a minute?

325
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:44,337
-Remember my check!
-lt's all l think of.

326
00:23:44,473 --> 00:23:45,940
Me too!

327
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:48,536
This'll only take a minute.

328
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:51,510
Great dressing room!
Nicer than mine!

329
00:23:51,646 --> 00:23:53,238
lt's Julie's....

330
00:23:53,381 --> 00:23:55,440
l'm getting married to Liliane.

331
00:23:55,584 --> 00:23:57,575
Fine. l'm glad to hear it.

332
00:23:57,719 --> 00:24:00,882
Here in Nice.
Before we finish shooting.

333
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:04,958
l wondered....
Would you mind being my best man?

334
00:24:05,093 --> 00:24:08,153
Not at all! l'd be delighted.

335
00:24:08,296 --> 00:24:10,856
You think this looks all right?

336
00:24:10,999 --> 00:24:13,524
-lt's not bad....
-Nice blue.

337
00:24:16,505 --> 00:24:19,872
Hit the fireplace
with a Senior Spot!

338
00:24:21,476 --> 00:24:23,068
A little more.

339
00:24:23,578 --> 00:24:25,273
That's good, hold it!

340
00:24:25,413 --> 00:24:29,873
Now a barndoor on the fire,
or we won't see it.

341
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,778
l can't take my eyes off the fire.

342
00:24:37,626 --> 00:24:41,392
People used to stare at fires,
now they watch TV.

343
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:45,795
We need to see moving images,
especially after dinner.

344
00:24:45,934 --> 00:24:47,526
l never thought of that.

345
00:24:49,471 --> 00:24:52,702
Alphonse told me.
l'm very happy for you.

346
00:24:52,841 --> 00:24:53,933
Congratulations.

347
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:55,474
Congratulations?

348
00:24:57,412 --> 00:25:00,643
Gilbert, light the 1 03.

349
00:25:00,782 --> 00:25:04,115
Put out the fire!
lt's smoking up the set.

350
00:25:09,224 --> 00:25:12,022
l'd like you to meet
two German girls.

351
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:15,220
They're sisters. Greta and Diana.

352
00:25:15,363 --> 00:25:19,163
She was in a big German
political film. Do you do any?

353
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:23,336
She was in an erotic film.
Why don't you do one?

354
00:25:23,538 --> 00:25:25,130
l have a good script...

355
00:25:25,307 --> 00:25:27,002
...about pollution.

356
00:25:27,209 --> 00:25:29,643
Excuse me. We've got a problem.

357
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:32,212
-What problem?
-l'm rescuing you!

358
00:25:33,048 --> 00:25:35,243
Meet Mr. Giacometti.

359
00:25:36,251 --> 00:25:37,377
Got a minute?

360
00:25:37,686 --> 00:25:38,983
After this shot.

361
00:25:40,222 --> 00:25:43,885
-Who's that guy?
-The cop who okay'd us to shoot...

362
00:25:44,025 --> 00:25:47,825
...in the streets. So Bertrand
invited him to watch us work.

363
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:50,727
That's nice! Do l watch him work?

364
00:25:50,865 --> 00:25:53,265
When he interrogates people?

365
00:25:54,669 --> 00:25:57,229
Severine, we're ready.

366
00:26:04,846 --> 00:26:06,404
You start here.

367
00:26:06,548 --> 00:26:09,540
Quiet! A full rehearsal.

368
00:26:12,687 --> 00:26:14,416
Let's go, Severine.

369
00:26:14,556 --> 00:26:17,150
l don't understand you, Alexander!

370
00:26:17,425 --> 00:26:19,154
You're....

371
00:26:19,294 --> 00:26:20,625
Peculiar.

372
00:26:21,196 --> 00:26:25,030
lt's all right!
Take it from the top, right away.

373
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:30,501
l don't understand you, Alexander.

374
00:26:30,739 --> 00:26:33,299
You've been peculiar lately.

375
00:26:33,441 --> 00:26:35,739
Walking out on dinner last night!

376
00:26:35,877 --> 00:26:37,868
That was an insult to Julie.

377
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:41,608
-Damn! l said Julie for Pamela!
-Not to worry.

378
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:43,445
That's bad....

379
00:26:43,585 --> 00:26:45,678
Don't worry.... Once more.

380
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:47,014
l've got an idea!

381
00:26:47,289 --> 00:26:51,385
l'll use numbers,
the way l do with Fellini!

382
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:55,462
lnstead of, ''l don't
understand you, Alexander'' ...

383
00:26:55,597 --> 00:26:59,397
...l'll say, ''22, 83, 1 6, 72....

384
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:03,402
5, 3, 1 8, 9, 1 4, 7, 9.

385
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:05,563
1 7, 1 0, 1 0, 4...

386
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:06,969
...1 8, 69!''

387
00:27:07,809 --> 00:27:10,607
lmpossible, Severine!

388
00:27:10,745 --> 00:27:13,908
ln France,
we have to say the lines.

389
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:19,351
See? We're recording direct sound.
We'll find another solution.

390
00:27:19,487 --> 00:27:23,082
You always give me the scene
at the last minute!

391
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:25,692
Then we'll use prompt cards.

392
00:27:25,827 --> 00:27:28,421
Joelle, come here, darling.

393
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:30,121
lt's all your fault.

394
00:27:30,265 --> 00:27:33,632
l don't understand you....

395
00:27:34,769 --> 00:27:37,237
You've been peculiar lately.

396
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:41,171
-Cut lots, we'll need them!
-Who asked you?

397
00:27:41,643 --> 00:27:43,975
Are they placed right?

398
00:27:46,181 --> 00:27:49,275
The last one's back there.

399
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:52,181
-Shooting now!
-Wait! Sound's reloading.

400
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,220
Sound's ready!

401
00:27:54,356 --> 00:27:56,221
Hurry, Bernard!

402
00:28:04,299 --> 00:28:06,767
l don't understand you, Alexander.

403
00:28:07,502 --> 00:28:09,993
You've been peculiar...

404
00:28:10,739 --> 00:28:12,036
...lately.

405
00:28:13,007 --> 00:28:15,874
Walking out on dinner last night!

406
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:20,047
That was an insult to...Pamela.

407
00:28:20,181 --> 00:28:22,979
After all, she is Alphonse's wife!

408
00:28:23,385 --> 00:28:24,909
You seem...

409
00:28:25,387 --> 00:28:29,790
...to hate her!
You never speak to her.

410
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:34,926
What do you want?
We're talking. Go away!

411
00:28:36,631 --> 00:28:39,862
And l won't tolerate that!

412
00:28:41,736 --> 00:28:42,998
Cut!

413
00:28:45,006 --> 00:28:46,439
l did it!

414
00:28:46,574 --> 00:28:47,768
Wasn't it good?

415
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:52,978
-Yes, but that's not the door!
-l thought it was.

416
00:28:53,114 --> 00:28:56,880
That's the closet. There's the door.

417
00:28:57,018 --> 00:28:58,679
Let's do it again.

418
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:01,380
We'll do it again.

419
00:29:01,523 --> 00:29:05,357
-l thought it was the same door.
-lt's all right. Ready!

420
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:07,757
They do look alike.

421
00:29:16,638 --> 00:29:19,300
l don't understand you, Alexander.

422
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:23,333
You've been peculiar lately.

423
00:29:23,545 --> 00:29:28,244
Walking out on dinner last night!
That was an insult to Pamela.

424
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:31,510
After all, she is Alphonse's wife!

425
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:36,116
You seem to hate her!
You never speak to her.

426
00:29:37,959 --> 00:29:42,760
What do you want? We're talking!
Go away!

427
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:47,263
And l won't tolerate that!

428
00:29:50,672 --> 00:29:52,867
Darling, look.

429
00:29:53,508 --> 00:29:55,772
l know the doors are alike, but....

430
00:29:57,345 --> 00:29:59,905
Not that one. This one!

431
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:11,548
You're my only friend!

432
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:15,624
Come to my dressing room?

433
00:30:15,763 --> 00:30:19,255
Come see me. Be nice!

434
00:30:31,646 --> 00:30:34,547
l don't understand you, Alexander.

435
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:38,350
You've been peculiar lately.

436
00:30:38,553 --> 00:30:42,853
Walking out on dinner last night!
That was an insult to Pamela.

437
00:30:43,024 --> 00:30:45,424
After all, she is Alphonse's wife!

438
00:31:01,409 --> 00:31:02,535
She'll never do it.

439
00:31:02,677 --> 00:31:04,201
lt's not my fault!

440
00:31:04,412 --> 00:31:05,902
Cut! Once more.

441
00:31:06,047 --> 00:31:10,609
lt's not my fault if l'm confused!

442
00:31:10,752 --> 00:31:15,246
l don't know if she's Odile,
actress. Or Odile, makeup girl!

443
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:18,689
ln my day, acting was acting...

444
00:31:18,826 --> 00:31:21,488
...and makeup was makeup!

445
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:24,029
No wonder l'm confused!

446
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:32,233
Anyone who has no business
on the set...

447
00:31:32,373 --> 00:31:35,433
...please leave now! Thanks.

448
00:31:53,795 --> 00:31:56,161
That doesn't mean you have to go.

449
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:59,164
l wanted to go to the movies,
anyway.

450
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:02,599
Makeup, give me my mirror.

451
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:06,572
lt's her fault, she's been boozing.

452
00:32:06,708 --> 00:32:09,609
Her son's dying of leukemia.
She's afraid.

453
00:32:09,744 --> 00:32:11,939
A phone call could come any time.

454
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,446
She almost turned down the film.

455
00:32:44,712 --> 00:32:47,374
lt'll be all right, Severine.

456
00:32:47,515 --> 00:32:49,881
We'll take a little break.

457
00:32:50,018 --> 00:32:54,955
l'm sorry. Maybe the wig
is giving me a headache.

458
00:32:56,124 --> 00:33:00,220
This has never happened before.
lt's the first time....

459
00:33:00,361 --> 00:33:02,158
Don't worry, Severine.

460
00:33:02,296 --> 00:33:04,093
Wrap it up for today!

461
00:33:04,666 --> 00:33:06,463
Get some rest.

462
00:33:06,601 --> 00:33:08,694
Where's Odile? Not that Odile!

463
00:33:08,836 --> 00:33:12,294
Tell the makeup girl
l want my scarf.

464
00:33:20,348 --> 00:33:23,647
Why don't you make
political films?

465
00:33:25,687 --> 00:33:28,212
Why don't you make erotic films?

466
00:33:28,723 --> 00:33:32,159
You have to finish shooting
in seven weeks.

467
00:33:50,912 --> 00:33:54,643
Miss Severine
needs Odile in makeup.

468
00:33:56,484 --> 00:33:59,044
Who is that woman l keep seeing?

469
00:33:59,187 --> 00:34:01,985
Lajoie's wife.
Follows him everywhere.

470
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:05,058
Shall l try to get rid of her?

471
00:34:05,193 --> 00:34:07,559
No, l'm getting used to her.

472
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:11,857
l don't know why Ferrand cast me.

473
00:34:11,999 --> 00:34:14,866
-He can't stand me!
-Who told you that?

474
00:34:15,002 --> 00:34:18,267
l know he thinks
l'm a lousy actress.

475
00:34:18,406 --> 00:34:22,069
Just between us, maybe he's right.

476
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:26,806
No, he didn't cast me!
Was it the producer?

477
00:34:26,948 --> 00:34:29,348
Something's peculiar
about this film.

478
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:32,078
He never considered anyone else.

479
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:34,780
-Really?
-l know it.

480
00:34:37,058 --> 00:34:39,891
You never understand anything
anyway!

481
00:34:40,027 --> 00:34:44,020
Well, l don't understand this!
lt destroys me!

482
00:34:44,198 --> 00:34:47,361
l'm sorry,
l was hired to play a secretary!

483
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:50,198
No one mentioned a swimsuit!

484
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:53,364
lf they had,
l'd have brought my own!

485
00:34:54,542 --> 00:34:58,137
lt's not in the script,
but the scene plays better.

486
00:34:58,279 --> 00:35:02,113
lt's a working vacation.
The secretary is a guest.

487
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:04,650
She's swimming...

488
00:35:04,786 --> 00:35:06,651
...then he dictates a letter.

489
00:35:06,788 --> 00:35:10,588
Sorry, it's impossible.
l'm not being difficult.

490
00:35:10,725 --> 00:35:13,421
l even learned to type!

491
00:35:13,561 --> 00:35:16,029
l wasn't told l had to swim.

492
00:35:16,164 --> 00:35:18,689
l won't go near the water!

493
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:23,637
What can we shoot
until she calms down?

494
00:35:23,771 --> 00:35:27,935
Until Julie Baker gets here,
the pool scene is all we have!

495
00:35:28,075 --> 00:35:30,635
Go talk to her,
try to convince her.

496
00:35:30,778 --> 00:35:35,374
An actress who won't appear
in a bathing suit is ludicrous!

497
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:45,558
Darling! A telegram!

498
00:35:45,693 --> 00:35:47,354
The children are coming!

499
00:35:47,495 --> 00:35:51,591
Our son got married
and we haven't met his bride!

500
00:35:51,732 --> 00:35:55,065
No, wait!
Here, this is for you.

501
00:35:55,203 --> 00:35:57,603
-They're coming?
-Day after tomorrow.

502
00:35:57,738 --> 00:35:59,205
lt's about time!

503
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:00,773
l'm delighted.

504
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:03,968
l'll write Stanley at once.

505
00:36:04,111 --> 00:36:09,139
l have to dictate a letter.
lt must go out today.

506
00:36:09,283 --> 00:36:10,477
Coming, sir.

507
00:36:10,618 --> 00:36:14,076
Don't worry,
Stanley will solve it.

508
00:36:14,222 --> 00:36:17,385
lf we could just rent
the house across the way!

509
00:36:17,525 --> 00:36:21,393
Marvelous!
Then they'd be close to us.

510
00:36:21,529 --> 00:36:25,363
Sorry to bother you now.
The letter's to Stanley.

511
00:36:25,499 --> 00:36:27,262
''Dear Stanley:

512
00:36:27,401 --> 00:36:31,030
l'm pleased to announce
the arrival of Alphonse...

513
00:36:31,172 --> 00:36:33,868
...and his young bride....''

514
00:36:34,008 --> 00:36:37,876
Now l see why she wouldn't
wear a swimsuit.

515
00:36:38,012 --> 00:36:39,343
Why? She's lovely!

516
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:42,040
Take another look.

517
00:36:42,216 --> 00:36:43,308
Good God!

518
00:36:44,819 --> 00:36:47,583
Stacey tricked us!
She's three months pregnant!

519
00:36:47,722 --> 00:36:51,624
She kept it secret,
so let's tear up her contract.

520
00:36:51,759 --> 00:36:56,196
l don't agree.
Frankly, l don't think it shows.

521
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:58,924
Come over here.

522
00:37:00,034 --> 00:37:02,434
Look at our schedule.

523
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:04,731
She shoots one more day now...

524
00:37:04,872 --> 00:37:07,568
...and comes back in six weeks.

525
00:37:07,708 --> 00:37:10,233
By then, it'll show!

526
00:37:10,378 --> 00:37:12,005
We have to replace her.

527
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:16,214
lt's not a problem!
We'll pick someone now...

528
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:18,011
...and call her agent.

529
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:20,382
Look, there's lots of girls.

530
00:37:21,422 --> 00:37:26,018
Stacey has an iron-clad contract.
Her agent knows it.

531
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,491
l'll lose!

532
00:37:27,628 --> 00:37:32,224
You know why?
Because in life, might makes right!

533
00:37:33,868 --> 00:37:36,098
Mr. Ferrand, a package for you.

534
00:37:36,237 --> 00:37:37,932
The books l ordered.

535
00:37:42,777 --> 00:37:46,076
-Delerue, the composer.
-l'll take it.

536
00:37:47,281 --> 00:37:51,445
Here's the playback
for the costume party scene.

537
00:38:16,477 --> 00:38:19,810
That's lovely, Georges,
thank you!

538
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:26,410
Airport, Julie's plane, press conference!

539
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:28,419
l can't be late.

540
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:31,957
Say! You like to improvise.

541
00:38:32,093 --> 00:38:36,393
Why can't the secretary
be pregnant in the film?

542
00:38:36,530 --> 00:38:38,293
Maybe she could--

543
00:38:38,432 --> 00:38:41,492
No! They'd suspect Alexander.

544
00:38:41,635 --> 00:38:44,832
lt'll confuse the story line.
We can't do it.

545
00:38:47,274 --> 00:38:49,333
Come to think of it...

546
00:38:49,477 --> 00:38:51,968
...Stacey isn't married!

547
00:38:52,113 --> 00:38:55,207
l wonder who the father is?

548
00:39:38,225 --> 00:39:40,352
Your questions, gentlemen.

549
00:39:41,495 --> 00:39:43,986
Can you tell us
about your new movie?

550
00:39:44,131 --> 00:39:47,100
Meet Pamela
is the story of a British girl...

551
00:39:47,234 --> 00:39:51,568
...who falls in love
with her husband's father.

552
00:39:51,705 --> 00:39:55,732
l think it's based on a true story.

553
00:39:55,876 --> 00:39:57,343
How does it end?

554
00:39:57,478 --> 00:40:01,574
Since it's a tragedy...

555
00:40:01,715 --> 00:40:03,205
...it'll end unhappily.

556
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:06,877
But l'd rather not reveal
all the details.

557
00:40:07,021 --> 00:40:11,924
Do you think these days
people care if a girl...

558
00:40:12,059 --> 00:40:14,653
...sleeps with her husband's father?

559
00:40:20,234 --> 00:40:25,171
When l like a script enough
to do it...

560
00:40:25,306 --> 00:40:28,036
...l think audiences will like it too.

561
00:40:28,209 --> 00:40:29,198
You do?

562
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:31,072
Yes, and l hope l'm right.

563
00:40:31,278 --> 00:40:35,647
Forgive me for intruding
into your private life...

564
00:40:35,783 --> 00:40:38,946
...but American papers reported...

565
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:42,521
...that after being ill,
you married your doctor.

566
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:47,252
No, l didn't marry my doctor.
l married a man who's a doctor!

567
00:40:47,461 --> 00:40:50,328
Why isn't the lucky man among us?

568
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:52,260
My husband came with me.

569
00:40:52,466 --> 00:40:55,902
ln fact he's here, in this very room.

570
00:40:56,103 --> 00:40:57,365
Where is he?

571
00:40:57,571 --> 00:40:59,835
Sorry, he hates publicity.

572
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:03,100
On that little note of mystery...

573
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:06,939
...we'll end this,
and let Miss Baker go to her hotel.

574
00:41:17,024 --> 00:41:19,584
Let the reporters leave first.

575
00:41:23,097 --> 00:41:25,930
This is my husband, Dr. Nelson.

576
00:41:33,107 --> 00:41:35,905
Could you move back, please?

577
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:37,975
You're in the shot, there.

578
00:41:38,179 --> 00:41:40,340
Thank you very much.

579
00:41:40,714 --> 00:41:42,272
She's always around!

580
00:41:42,483 --> 00:41:46,544
-She's Lajoie's wife.
-She think she's a crew member?

581
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:51,487
No, she thinks women are after him!
She makes his life hell.

582
00:41:51,692 --> 00:41:53,557
He's too weak to dump her.

583
00:41:53,694 --> 00:41:58,222
We call them
''The Sorrow and the Pity'' !

584
00:41:58,432 --> 00:42:00,992
Lajoie, we're ready to shoot.

585
00:42:02,036 --> 00:42:04,402
What's going on there?

586
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:06,266
l don't like that at all!

587
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,198
You have ''le trac''?

588
00:42:08,842 --> 00:42:10,673
What does that mean?

589
00:42:13,714 --> 00:42:16,683
Liliane! Slate this one, please!

590
00:42:16,884 --> 00:42:18,875
Our stills man's very busy!

591
00:42:20,754 --> 00:42:21,982
Roll it!

592
00:42:27,895 --> 00:42:29,556
The car!

593
00:42:48,182 --> 00:42:50,582
Hello, children!

594
00:42:50,784 --> 00:42:52,581
My parents....

595
00:42:53,287 --> 00:42:55,380
Meet Pamela!

596
00:42:55,589 --> 00:42:57,989
Pan over to the stairs!

597
00:42:58,192 --> 00:43:00,854
l know you'll be happy here.

598
00:43:01,061 --> 00:43:03,529
Too bad our house isn't larger.

599
00:43:03,731 --> 00:43:08,065
From the balcony
you can see the sea!

600
00:43:08,269 --> 00:43:09,600
She's charming....

601
00:43:09,803 --> 00:43:11,065
Do you like it?

602
00:43:14,441 --> 00:43:16,705
My son never tells me anything!

603
00:43:16,910 --> 00:43:19,105
l don't even know how you met.

604
00:43:19,313 --> 00:43:23,841
l was on vacation in Yorkshire
with my two cousins...

605
00:43:24,051 --> 00:43:25,712
...Dorothy and Elizabeth.

606
00:43:25,919 --> 00:43:27,887
He had a date with Dorothy.

607
00:43:28,088 --> 00:43:32,388
She got chicken pox,
so l went on the date.

608
00:43:32,593 --> 00:43:34,493
l don't know Dorothy...

609
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:37,721
...but l'm glad
you didn't get chicken pox!

610
00:43:37,931 --> 00:43:39,865
Who got chicken pox?

611
00:43:40,067 --> 00:43:41,295
Guess!

612
00:43:41,502 --> 00:43:42,867
Cut!

613
00:43:43,070 --> 00:43:44,230
How was it?

614
00:43:44,438 --> 00:43:47,430
Not bad,
but we'll try something else.

615
00:43:48,409 --> 00:43:50,070
We're doing it again?

616
00:43:50,277 --> 00:43:51,539
Was l late?

617
00:43:51,745 --> 00:43:54,111
We'll try it differently.

618
00:43:55,482 --> 00:43:58,076
-Take a break, Severine.
-Odile!

619
00:44:02,756 --> 00:44:06,852
l wanted you with me,
so l got you the job!

620
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:09,461
l wanted us to be together.

621
00:44:09,663 --> 00:44:13,292
But learning to be a script girl
is a waste of time.

622
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:16,594
-l want to learn film editing.
-Film editing?

623
00:44:16,804 --> 00:44:20,672
You just had to say the word!
l'd have arranged it!

624
00:44:23,377 --> 00:44:26,346
You're here to take stills, right?

625
00:44:32,152 --> 00:44:34,985
Odile!
Get that bottle out of my sight!

626
00:44:37,024 --> 00:44:38,548
How's your mother?

627
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:41,523
Fine! l told her
we were working together.

628
00:44:41,729 --> 00:44:43,196
She sends her love.

629
00:44:43,564 --> 00:44:47,295
Marvelous woman!
Everyone in Hollywood loved her.

630
00:44:47,501 --> 00:44:51,528
-Too bad she quit when she did.
-But she's still very busy.

631
00:44:52,473 --> 00:44:57,376
She hated the way we shoot movies,
in bits and pieces!

632
00:44:57,978 --> 00:45:01,038
l remember escorting her
to the premiere...

633
00:45:01,248 --> 00:45:05,150
...of her first big Hollywood movie.
A fantastic evening!

634
00:45:05,352 --> 00:45:06,819
When the film ended...

635
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:10,617
...she sat there,
then turned to me and said...

636
00:45:10,824 --> 00:45:14,089
...''l did all that?
All l remember is the waiting.''

637
00:45:14,294 --> 00:45:15,352
lt's so true!

638
00:45:15,562 --> 00:45:19,259
l'm calm, not yelling.
But l say you're on the make!

639
00:45:19,466 --> 00:45:22,833
-That's not true!
-Oh, no? l'm in agony!

640
00:45:23,036 --> 00:45:27,132
l'm in agony all the time!
l can't wait to finish a scene...

641
00:45:27,341 --> 00:45:30,868
...so l can go look for you!
l'm a complete wreck!

642
00:45:31,245 --> 00:45:32,872
l can't find Alphonse!

643
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:34,911
l know where he is.

644
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:43,087
While l'm shooting, l'm in agony!

645
00:45:44,191 --> 00:45:47,319
Can l shoot a scene
when l'm like this?

646
00:45:47,528 --> 00:45:50,463
l'm supposed to keep cool!

647
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:53,360
lf l'm no good, you're to blame!

648
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:06,035
l'm sorry to make you die again.

649
00:46:06,246 --> 00:46:10,910
l'm used to it.
ln 80 movies, l've died 24 times.

650
00:46:11,118 --> 00:46:13,882
Electrocuted twice, hanged twice....

651
00:46:14,087 --> 00:46:16,851
l've been knifed,
committed suicide...

652
00:46:17,057 --> 00:46:20,549
...died in accidents,
but never a natural death.

653
00:46:20,761 --> 00:46:24,094
Anyway,
l don't think death is natural.

654
00:46:28,569 --> 00:46:31,299
Julie will be right out,
she's changing.

655
00:46:31,438 --> 00:46:34,601
-Did things go well?
-l'm very pleased.

656
00:46:34,741 --> 00:46:37,972
l've never used an actress
l hadn't met before.

657
00:46:38,178 --> 00:46:42,012
But Julie's just right,
determined, yet fragile.

658
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:44,116
She's perfect for the role.

659
00:46:44,318 --> 00:46:45,580
lt'll go fine.

660
00:47:26,693 --> 00:47:29,526
Sorry to keep you waiting, Stacey.

661
00:47:30,063 --> 00:47:33,055
lt'll take five minutes, Bernard.

662
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:35,792
You won't miss your plane.

663
00:47:43,977 --> 00:47:46,241
Ready with the pool scene?

664
00:47:46,446 --> 00:47:48,277
Good, let's run it.

665
00:47:53,754 --> 00:47:57,053
I need you.
I have an urgent letter to dictate.

666
00:47:57,257 --> 00:47:59,191
Yes, sir. Right away.

667
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:07,225
-lt doesn't show at all.
-You're sure? Good!

668
00:48:07,434 --> 00:48:09,868
-That's lovely.
-lf you say so....

669
00:48:10,203 --> 00:48:11,568
lt's not too...?

670
00:48:18,745 --> 00:48:21,976
-So it's okay?
-You can leave, don't worry.

671
00:48:23,617 --> 00:48:25,107
Have a nice trip.

672
00:48:30,390 --> 00:48:32,153
Now run the rest....

673
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:54,604
Know what?

674
00:48:54,815 --> 00:48:57,613
l want to touch you.

675
00:48:57,818 --> 00:49:01,219
-What's that set?
-The love nest.

676
00:49:01,421 --> 00:49:04,788
-lt's in the script!
-l never read scripts.

677
00:49:04,992 --> 00:49:09,258
lt's when Alexander
runs off with Pamela.

678
00:49:09,463 --> 00:49:14,526
They stop at a shady motel....
Get it?

679
00:49:14,735 --> 00:49:17,169
lt's morning,
they want to make love.

680
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:20,807
She puts the tray outside
to keep the maid out.

681
00:49:21,341 --> 00:49:25,243
l'll leave.
You're not in this scene.

682
00:49:25,445 --> 00:49:27,845
Don't worry, l'll be around.

683
00:49:29,182 --> 00:49:32,345
Let me ask you....
Are women magic?

684
00:49:32,552 --> 00:49:34,850
No, they're not.
Neither are men.

685
00:49:35,055 --> 00:49:37,922
lf a woman says
she's known outstanding men...

686
00:49:38,058 --> 00:49:40,526
...it means she's slept around....

687
00:49:45,365 --> 00:49:47,128
Excuse me, sir.

688
00:49:52,205 --> 00:49:54,867
l have to take three days off.

689
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:57,908
You're leaving the crew?

690
00:49:58,111 --> 00:50:00,045
My mother just died.

691
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:03,978
-l see. Was it sudden?
-No, she was in great pain.

692
00:50:04,184 --> 00:50:06,084
For her, it was a relief.

693
00:50:06,286 --> 00:50:10,313
-l see. Well, go ahead.
-But someone will fill in for me.

694
00:50:10,524 --> 00:50:12,651
Sure, l understand.

695
00:50:14,861 --> 00:50:17,523
l think we can start now.

696
00:50:19,966 --> 00:50:22,264
You're not in the way, doctor.

697
00:50:22,469 --> 00:50:27,930
Sit down. This shot should be fun.

698
00:50:28,141 --> 00:50:31,474
l came to say goodbye.
My plane leaves in an hour.

699
00:50:31,678 --> 00:50:34,909
lf l'm through, l'll drive you.

700
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:37,174
What are we waiting for now?

701
00:50:37,384 --> 00:50:38,749
Bernard, as usual.

702
00:50:39,586 --> 00:50:41,178
l'm ready!

703
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:48,390
One cat's milk,
another cat's poison!

704
00:50:50,997 --> 00:50:53,227
All right, we can go.

705
00:50:53,433 --> 00:50:55,424
Ready, Alexander? Julie?

706
00:51:07,447 --> 00:51:09,938
Not too romantic, the kiss....

707
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,263
The cat!

708
00:51:40,881 --> 00:51:46,148
The boom is scaring it!
We'll wild-track the sound.

709
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:48,116
At the fish market!

710
00:51:59,766 --> 00:52:00,824
Cut! Once more!

711
00:52:01,034 --> 00:52:02,865
Do it this time, or else!

712
00:52:10,510 --> 00:52:12,944
l swear,
it hasn't been fed in three days!

713
00:52:14,181 --> 00:52:16,012
Throw it in!

714
00:52:22,055 --> 00:52:25,923
We'll shoot the scene
when you find a cat that can act!

715
00:52:26,126 --> 00:52:28,117
l told you to get two cats!

716
00:52:30,764 --> 00:52:32,288
Miss Know-lt-All!

717
00:52:51,318 --> 00:52:53,183
But when we're through...

718
00:52:53,386 --> 00:52:56,753
...l still have
to remove my makeup.

719
00:52:56,957 --> 00:52:59,118
Why did you let me down, puss?

720
00:52:59,326 --> 00:53:01,726
You got me in trouble!

721
00:53:01,928 --> 00:53:03,418
Now where's Joelle?

722
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:06,922
l found one!
lt's the studio cat.

723
00:53:07,133 --> 00:53:11,627
l can tell by looking at it
that it won't perform!

724
00:53:11,838 --> 00:53:14,329
Don't fight.
We'll try the studio cat.

725
00:53:16,343 --> 00:53:17,833
Places, everybody!

726
00:53:18,345 --> 00:53:19,334
The kiss....

727
00:53:20,046 --> 00:53:21,035
The tray....

728
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:25,508
The door....

729
00:53:28,788 --> 00:53:30,483
The cat!

730
00:53:40,901 --> 00:53:42,266
Focus!

731
00:54:00,854 --> 00:54:02,617
Focus on the cat!

732
00:54:29,582 --> 00:54:34,042
Excuse me....
Can l ask you something?

733
00:54:35,021 --> 00:54:38,388
ln your opinion, are women magic?

734
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:42,355
Some are, yes.

735
00:54:43,029 --> 00:54:44,257
Others, no!

736
00:55:01,481 --> 00:55:04,245
Don't worry.
Julie will be fine.

737
00:55:04,451 --> 00:55:09,479
Yes, she's very happy on this film.
l'm sure she'll come through.

738
00:55:09,689 --> 00:55:13,785
-Actors are so vulnerable!
-Of course they are.

739
00:55:13,994 --> 00:55:18,260
Everyone is afraid of being judged.
But actors...

740
00:55:18,465 --> 00:55:21,195
...are always being judged.

741
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:24,063
ln your work, and in your life!

742
00:55:24,270 --> 00:55:28,468
We wonder what people think of us,
if they love us.

743
00:55:28,675 --> 00:55:32,406
lt must be the same
for all performers.

744
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:37,709
As a child, when Mozart
was asked to play, he'd reply...

745
00:55:37,917 --> 00:55:41,318
...''Gladly,
but first say you love me.''

746
00:55:41,521 --> 00:55:45,150
And in your job,
you're always kissing.

747
00:55:45,358 --> 00:55:47,121
As you say....

748
00:55:47,327 --> 00:55:49,921
Yes, we do a lot of kissing.

749
00:55:50,130 --> 00:55:54,931
The handshake was invented
to show you're unarmed, friendly.

750
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:56,966
We went one better.

751
00:55:57,170 --> 00:55:59,195
We show our love.

752
00:55:59,839 --> 00:56:02,831
''My darling, you're so wonderful....''

753
00:56:04,277 --> 00:56:05,972
We need all that!

754
00:56:47,187 --> 00:56:50,520
Meet Christian Fersen.
Our director, Mr. Ferrand.

755
00:56:50,790 --> 00:56:53,884
Were you waiting outside?
You should've come in.

756
00:56:54,027 --> 00:56:56,393
Do you see what l see?

757
00:56:58,465 --> 00:57:01,730
-Are women magic?
-Not women, their legs!

758
00:57:01,935 --> 00:57:03,800
That's why they wear skirts.

759
00:57:04,003 --> 00:57:07,666
Cut the crap! We going to a movie?

760
00:57:07,874 --> 00:57:10,468
-When does it start?
-We gotta leave.

761
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:14,477
The kitchen scene must be shot
tomorrow night!

762
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:18,117
The union contract
calls for a 1 2-hour break.

763
00:57:18,318 --> 00:57:22,311
Joelle, we must shoot
the kitchen tomorrow.

764
00:57:22,455 --> 00:57:26,721
-Can you work with me tonight?
-Okay. So much for the movies!

765
00:57:27,727 --> 00:57:29,251
What's this l hear?

766
00:57:29,395 --> 00:57:31,863
Yes,
we do the kitchen scene tomorrow.

767
00:57:31,998 --> 00:57:35,490
-Can l have my lines?
-After dinner, tonight.

768
00:57:35,702 --> 00:57:38,796
-That's not much time!
-lt's not written yet.

769
00:57:39,005 --> 00:57:41,735
Read it once
and put it under your pillow.

770
00:57:41,941 --> 00:57:44,774
ln the morning,
you'll know it by heart!

771
00:57:44,978 --> 00:57:46,946
You're an optimist!

772
00:57:49,883 --> 00:57:53,341
Reporters always ask
the same questions.

773
00:57:53,553 --> 00:57:55,680
''How does it feel to be famous?

774
00:57:55,822 --> 00:57:59,053
To be recognized
and asked for autographs?''

775
00:57:59,259 --> 00:58:04,526
But no TV program l've seen
ever shows that a working movie-star...

776
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:08,531
...gets up at 6 a.m.
and gets home at 9 p.m.!

777
00:58:08,868 --> 00:58:11,200
A 1 5-hour workday!

778
00:58:12,105 --> 00:58:13,663
Not quite 1 5 hours.

779
00:58:13,873 --> 00:58:17,900
Say 1 3.
Or 1 4, if you go to the rushes.

780
00:58:18,611 --> 00:58:21,876
Miss Severine isn't in her room.

781
00:58:26,745 --> 00:58:30,203
The Godfather
is showing all over Nice.

782
00:58:30,416 --> 00:58:32,884
lt's wiping out every other movie!

783
00:58:33,085 --> 00:58:36,452
Speaking of godfathers,
how about Alexander?

784
00:58:36,588 --> 00:58:39,580
He fooled everybody.
We all expected a Lolita...

785
00:58:39,725 --> 00:58:43,183
...and a handsome Romeo
got off the plane!

786
00:58:43,395 --> 00:58:47,991
Maybe he could do
Pamela's car-accident stunt.

787
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:52,193
lt's too dangerous!
We need a real stuntman!

788
00:58:52,404 --> 00:58:54,235
Back to the kitchen scene!

789
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:58,604
That night, Alexander
finds Pamela in the kitchen.

790
00:58:58,811 --> 00:59:00,039
Why the kitchen?

791
00:59:00,245 --> 00:59:03,612
So as not to arouse any suspicions.

792
00:59:03,816 --> 00:59:06,614
l'm not happy with my first draft.

793
00:59:06,819 --> 00:59:09,310
He: ''You know
what's happening to us?''

794
00:59:09,521 --> 00:59:11,614
She: ''l think l do.''
That's bad!

795
00:59:11,824 --> 00:59:15,988
Pamela must know,
or her character will seem weak.

796
00:59:16,195 --> 00:59:20,859
The scene needs a new idea.
Call your cowriter!

797
00:59:21,066 --> 00:59:24,627
l thought of it. He's in Japan.

798
00:59:24,837 --> 00:59:27,738
He's adapting
Turgenev's First Love.

799
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:30,340
Set in modern Japan! Great idea!

800
00:59:30,542 --> 00:59:33,477
Better than Pamela!
l should've done it!

801
00:59:34,279 --> 00:59:35,803
Want a story line?

802
00:59:36,014 --> 00:59:38,915
How about
''Kissinger's Successful Mission''?

803
00:59:39,118 --> 00:59:41,985
''Heart Transplant.''
''Jeweler Knifes Wife.''

804
00:59:42,187 --> 00:59:44,985
Back to work!
You dictate, l'll type.

805
00:59:45,190 --> 00:59:47,522
We promised it to Julie tonight.

806
00:59:47,826 --> 00:59:49,885
Okay, back to the kitchen....

807
00:59:50,095 --> 00:59:53,292
No more guilt
or sense of shame.

808
00:59:53,499 --> 00:59:57,936
They decide to run away
like thieves in the night.

809
00:59:58,137 --> 01:00:00,867
Pamela could actually say that!

810
01:00:01,073 --> 01:00:04,065
We must show
that she's completely lucid.

811
01:00:04,276 --> 01:00:07,404
She loved the son,
now she loves the father.

812
01:00:07,613 --> 01:00:11,481
-That must come across.
-Julie explained it very well.

813
01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:14,448
Here's her interview,
in the morning paper.

814
01:00:14,653 --> 01:00:18,453
''The girl realizes
the boy she married...

815
01:00:18,657 --> 01:00:21,387
...is only a pale reflection
of his father.''

816
01:00:21,527 --> 01:00:24,223
She understood the script! Why?

817
01:00:24,429 --> 01:00:28,195
Because her mother was an actress.
She knows Hollywood...

818
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:31,836
...where many kids try to live up
to famous parents.

819
01:00:32,037 --> 01:00:35,165
Fairbanks, Barrymore and others.

820
01:00:35,374 --> 01:00:36,841
Alexander:

821
01:00:37,743 --> 01:00:41,679
''You know what's happening to us?''
Damn, the phone!

822
01:00:44,650 --> 01:00:48,142
Miss Dominique is here,
should she come up?

823
01:00:48,353 --> 01:00:51,720
Sorry, l'm working.
l'll call tomorrow.

824
01:00:51,890 --> 01:00:53,551
l'll give her the message.

825
01:00:53,725 --> 01:00:56,888
He's sorry, he has to work tonight.

826
01:00:57,095 --> 01:00:59,222
He'll call you tomorrow.

827
01:00:59,431 --> 01:01:01,695
-Three guesses?
-Stacked!

828
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:04,232
-Riviera beauty.
-Local call-girl.

829
01:01:04,369 --> 01:01:06,303
-''The warrior's rest'' !
-Right!

830
01:01:06,505 --> 01:01:08,029
Hey, the movie quiz!

831
01:01:11,877 --> 01:01:14,402
In what movie
did Jeanne Moreau costar...

832
01:01:14,580 --> 01:01:17,481
...with Orson Welles,
in a Shakespeare film?

833
01:01:18,183 --> 01:01:19,548
Falstaff!

834
01:01:19,751 --> 01:01:20,740
Correct.

835
01:01:20,919 --> 01:01:23,911
In what movie
was she Charles IX's sister...

836
01:01:24,122 --> 01:01:25,680
...and Henry IV's wife?

837
01:01:27,526 --> 01:01:28,515
Queen Margot!

838
01:01:28,660 --> 01:01:30,753
Right.
You know your stuff.

839
01:01:31,597 --> 01:01:34,361
Julie, here's tomorrow's scene.

840
01:01:50,015 --> 01:01:52,074
''Yes, l'm in love with you.''

841
01:01:54,186 --> 01:01:57,815
''We both knew it
at the costume party.

842
01:01:58,023 --> 01:02:01,254
l can't stay here,
l'm leaving tomorrow.''

843
01:02:51,343 --> 01:02:52,901
Let's close the window.

844
01:02:53,045 --> 01:02:56,742
Remember,
no sentimentality in this scene.

845
01:02:56,949 --> 01:02:59,179
Play it straight, cold...

846
01:02:59,384 --> 01:03:02,080
...almost violent!
The rehearsal was good.

847
01:03:02,287 --> 01:03:04,482
Let's do a take.

848
01:03:06,358 --> 01:03:08,826
Lights out! Rain!

849
01:03:09,027 --> 01:03:10,494
Less rain!

850
01:03:28,313 --> 01:03:29,940
Can't you sleep?

851
01:03:30,916 --> 01:03:33,612
l heard someone.
l knew it was you.

852
01:03:34,586 --> 01:03:36,645
You can't sleep either?

853
01:03:36,855 --> 01:03:38,755
l was thinking of you.

854
01:03:39,858 --> 01:03:42,588
You know what's happening to us?

855
01:03:44,262 --> 01:03:46,423
Yes, l'm in love with you.

856
01:03:47,799 --> 01:03:49,733
How long have you known?

857
01:03:51,169 --> 01:03:54,138
We both knew at the costume party.

858
01:03:55,607 --> 01:03:59,043
l can't stay here,
l'm leaving tomorrow.

859
01:03:59,878 --> 01:04:01,539
l've thought of it too.

860
01:04:01,747 --> 01:04:07,049
-l want us to leave together.
-That would be like running away.

861
01:04:07,252 --> 01:04:10,244
Yes, it would. l know.

862
01:04:11,523 --> 01:04:13,753
But l don't want to lose you.

863
01:04:15,827 --> 01:04:19,661
Then let's leave now,
like thieves in the night.

864
01:04:20,565 --> 01:04:22,396
Cut! How was it, Walter?

865
01:04:22,601 --> 01:04:25,968
Fine, perfect!
What do we do next?

866
01:04:26,171 --> 01:04:27,729
We do it again.

867
01:04:38,450 --> 01:04:40,782
Like thieves in the night.

868
01:04:42,387 --> 01:04:44,082
Like thieves....

869
01:04:58,837 --> 01:05:01,362
We've been looking for you
for an hour!

870
01:05:01,506 --> 01:05:03,770
l was waiting in my dressing room.

871
01:05:03,975 --> 01:05:06,273
But you were told last night.

872
01:05:06,478 --> 01:05:10,175
No, l wasn't!
l didn't get a call sheet.

873
01:05:10,382 --> 01:05:12,475
All right, let's do it now.

874
01:05:13,385 --> 01:05:15,376
The shooting is half-finished.

875
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:18,546
Before starting,
I hope to make a fine movie.

876
01:05:18,757 --> 01:05:21,123
The problems begin
and I aim lower!

877
01:05:21,326 --> 01:05:24,318
I hope to make the movie, period!

878
01:05:24,529 --> 01:05:27,259
Halfway through I say to myself...

879
01:05:27,466 --> 01:05:30,128
... " You could've worked harder,
given more.

880
01:05:30,335 --> 01:05:32,633
You can still make up for it!"

881
01:05:32,838 --> 01:05:37,138
And I start trying harder
to bring the film to life.

882
01:05:37,843 --> 01:05:40,641
Meet Pamela is
on the right track, now.

883
01:05:40,846 --> 01:05:45,579
The actors are into their roles,
the crew is solid, problems resolved.

884
01:05:45,784 --> 01:05:47,649
Cinema is King!

885
01:08:02,287 --> 01:08:05,950
The drinks are on Alexander today!

886
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:10,751
Any champagne left?

887
01:08:10,962 --> 01:08:13,863
No, we'll have
to move on to Pernod.

888
01:08:14,032 --> 01:08:16,500
Champagne's gone.
You won't get drunk.

889
01:08:16,701 --> 01:08:21,104
Make yourselves at home.
Help yourselves!

890
01:08:28,713 --> 01:08:31,341
He's handsome enough
to be in movies.

891
01:08:31,549 --> 01:08:34,382
He wants no part of it.

892
01:08:34,653 --> 01:08:36,587
He's into tennis.

893
01:08:41,593 --> 01:08:44,528
l want to ask you something.

894
01:08:45,063 --> 01:08:47,759
l've decided to adopt Christian.

895
01:08:48,133 --> 01:08:50,465
l've always wanted a son.

896
01:08:50,669 --> 01:08:52,227
Maybe l'm silly...

897
01:08:52,437 --> 01:08:56,840
...but l want someone
to bear my name after l'm gone.

898
01:08:57,042 --> 01:08:58,509
lt's a wonderful idea!

899
01:08:58,710 --> 01:09:01,873
But there are problems.
Legal ones, l mean.

900
01:09:02,213 --> 01:09:06,707
l'm not married now,
and he hasn't got a French passport.

901
01:09:07,118 --> 01:09:11,248
Know what you should do?
Talk to President Lebaille!

902
01:09:11,523 --> 01:09:15,152
The electrician's grandfather.

903
01:09:16,094 --> 01:09:19,257
Go fish!
The cameraman's mother.

904
01:09:22,300 --> 01:09:24,632
Meet Mark Spencer.

905
01:09:25,270 --> 01:09:26,999
He's the British stuntman.

906
01:09:27,138 --> 01:09:31,131
-Just got here, speaks no French.
-Julie will help.

907
01:09:32,510 --> 01:09:35,673
Tell him the car crash
we're shooting tomorrow...

908
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:38,110
...will be in ''nuit américaine.''

909
01:09:38,316 --> 01:09:39,874
What's that?

910
01:09:40,085 --> 01:09:43,851
A night scene shot in daylight
with a special filter.

911
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:57,731
Dressed as she is now.

912
01:10:00,805 --> 01:10:02,204
He didn't understand.

913
01:10:08,913 --> 01:10:11,313
Stay here with me this morning.

914
01:10:11,516 --> 01:10:12,983
Are you crazy?

915
01:10:13,184 --> 01:10:15,812
Why? What are they shooting today?

916
01:10:16,020 --> 01:10:19,820
Pamela's death.
The stuntman's doing the car crash.

917
01:10:20,024 --> 01:10:22,254
See? lt's not an important scene!

918
01:10:22,460 --> 01:10:24,257
l'm late. They're waiting.

919
01:10:24,462 --> 01:10:29,058
Follow me and watch for the arrows!

920
01:10:33,204 --> 01:10:35,604
What's this watch?

921
01:10:35,807 --> 01:10:39,265
Pierrot lent it to me.
Mine's being fixed.

922
01:10:39,477 --> 01:10:41,672
Give it back to him!

923
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:44,440
l'll buy you a watch,
if you need one.

924
01:10:49,487 --> 01:10:52,149
-Making it tough on me?
-Go on.

925
01:10:52,357 --> 01:10:55,292
But that's mine. Keep it for me!

926
01:10:55,493 --> 01:10:56,482
Sure, l will.

927
01:10:57,095 --> 01:11:00,223
Hurry, guys! Let's move it!

928
01:11:20,385 --> 01:11:22,853
-What are you doing today?
-And you?

929
01:11:23,054 --> 01:11:25,989
l'm going antique hunting.

930
01:11:26,191 --> 01:11:27,488
l'll go to a movie.

931
01:12:11,002 --> 01:12:12,867
What's the matter?

932
01:12:13,071 --> 01:12:14,971
A damned flat!

933
01:12:15,640 --> 01:12:18,302
And you don't know
how to change a tire!

934
01:12:18,510 --> 01:12:22,378
Help me!
l'll be late for the shooting.

935
01:12:22,580 --> 01:12:25,572
When you're driving,
you don't need a man!

936
01:12:25,717 --> 01:12:26,775
We'll be late.

937
01:12:26,918 --> 01:12:28,909
Move! lt must be up front.

938
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:32,385
-You've never used a jack?
-l'm not a mechanic!

939
01:12:32,590 --> 01:12:35,821
Neither am l!
What if you run out of gas?

940
01:12:36,027 --> 01:12:37,927
Then l put some in.

941
01:12:38,129 --> 01:12:40,256
ln the carburetor, probably!

942
01:12:40,465 --> 01:12:42,456
There. We're filthy!

943
01:12:42,667 --> 01:12:44,726
l'll change into my sweater.

944
01:12:49,107 --> 01:12:50,335
Hold that.

945
01:12:52,977 --> 01:12:55,343
Joelle, if you're in the mood....

946
01:12:55,513 --> 01:12:56,502
For what?

947
01:12:56,714 --> 01:12:59,683
We're all alone here....

948
01:13:00,151 --> 01:13:01,618
Okay, you're on!

949
01:13:01,819 --> 01:13:02,945
What?

950
01:13:03,154 --> 01:13:07,682
All bark and no bite!
But when it's time for action....

951
01:13:07,892 --> 01:13:09,826
You're willing?

952
01:13:10,528 --> 01:13:12,792
But we haven't got all day.

953
01:13:19,437 --> 01:13:20,927
Move it!

954
01:13:25,810 --> 01:13:30,008
-So where's Joelle?
-She's not here. Neither is Bernard!

955
01:13:31,783 --> 01:13:35,219
A life-size inflatable doll, guys!
For the car!

956
01:13:36,588 --> 01:13:40,991
-Or for your bathtub!
-You're lucky he doesn't understand!

957
01:13:41,192 --> 01:13:43,319
He'd slug you!

958
01:13:43,528 --> 01:13:46,326
This isn't slow-motion,
move your asses!

959
01:13:46,531 --> 01:13:50,797
You've all got sex on the brain.
Dirty talk all day long!

960
01:13:50,969 --> 01:13:53,938
Whatcha doing, making a movie?

961
01:13:54,138 --> 01:13:56,834
You need stars, we're available!

962
01:13:57,041 --> 01:13:59,236
Let the workers through.

963
01:14:01,179 --> 01:14:03,272
We're all farmers, right?

964
01:14:03,481 --> 01:14:07,850
-Right, we're all farmers!
-Funny, you don't look Jewish!

965
01:14:08,686 --> 01:14:12,452
Heard from your wife and kids,
Pierrot?

966
01:14:13,758 --> 01:14:16,818
-So you finally got here!
-My car broke down!

967
01:14:16,961 --> 01:14:20,226
Lucky l left after her, or she'd....

968
01:14:21,666 --> 01:14:23,190
Fill me in.

969
01:14:25,770 --> 01:14:27,601
Hey, you changed your top.

970
01:14:27,805 --> 01:14:30,000
Ready to shoot!

971
01:15:11,082 --> 01:15:13,812
Okay, second camera?

972
01:15:13,985 --> 01:15:15,782
-The stuntman?
-He's done.

973
01:15:15,987 --> 01:15:18,478
Then he can pack up and leave.

974
01:15:27,065 --> 01:15:31,798
He promised me a ride, but he
took Liliane instead. Pretty cool!

975
01:15:56,227 --> 01:15:58,593
What's all that luggage?

976
01:16:00,498 --> 01:16:02,591
l might as well tell you.

977
01:16:04,402 --> 01:16:09,169
We're in love.
He's taking me to London.

978
01:16:09,373 --> 01:16:10,704
The film's not finished!

979
01:16:10,908 --> 01:16:14,503
They don't need me,
l'm a fifth wheel.

980
01:16:14,712 --> 01:16:16,236
You can't just quit.

981
01:16:16,447 --> 01:16:19,280
They only hired me
for Alphonse's sake.

982
01:16:19,484 --> 01:16:20,883
How is he taking this?

983
01:16:21,018 --> 01:16:25,682
-He'll get the surprise tonight.
-He'll be terribly upset!

984
01:16:25,890 --> 01:16:28,051
He's always terribly upset.

985
01:16:28,259 --> 01:16:31,126
He's a spoiled brat
who won't grow up.

986
01:16:31,329 --> 01:16:33,991
He loves you
and wants to marry you.

987
01:16:34,198 --> 01:16:36,564
He mentioned marriage, l didn't!

988
01:16:36,734 --> 01:16:38,998
Just the word gives me the creeps.

989
01:16:39,203 --> 01:16:44,698
Anyway, he needs a wife, a mistress,
a nanny, a nurse, a sister....

990
01:16:44,909 --> 01:16:47,070
l can't play all those roles!

991
01:16:47,278 --> 01:16:50,907
You're being cruel,
and don't even realize it.

992
01:16:51,115 --> 01:16:53,982
l'm through with Alphonse!

993
01:16:54,752 --> 01:16:58,654
He wants the whole world
to pay for his unhappy childhood!

994
01:17:04,061 --> 01:17:06,586
Julie, come get in the photo!

995
01:17:08,833 --> 01:17:13,634
-What photo?
-A souvenir for me. lt's my last day!

996
01:17:16,607 --> 01:17:19,269
Wait. Here comes Stacey.

997
01:17:29,086 --> 01:17:31,782
Come on, Stacey.
We're proud of you!

998
01:17:31,989 --> 01:17:35,425
Stand there.
Looks like it's due soon.

999
01:17:35,626 --> 01:17:38,186
And it's not even twins!

1000
01:17:38,396 --> 01:17:42,162
Lucky girl! All her shots
will be close-ups now!

1001
01:17:44,435 --> 01:17:45,697
Don't move!

1002
01:17:46,270 --> 01:17:50,639
Wait! We're missing Liliane!
Where is she?

1003
01:17:50,842 --> 01:17:53,140
l have to talk to you.

1004
01:17:56,280 --> 01:17:58,441
Liliane won't be coming....

1005
01:18:14,432 --> 01:18:16,400
She was right to leave.

1006
01:18:16,601 --> 01:18:19,695
l understand,
it had to end this way.

1007
01:18:21,405 --> 01:18:24,738
-Don't move!
-Now Alphonse has disappeared!

1008
01:18:28,713 --> 01:18:30,271
And where's Odile?

1009
01:18:33,017 --> 01:18:35,611
Liliane ran off with the stuntman.

1010
01:18:35,820 --> 01:18:37,617
Does Alphonse know?

1011
01:18:37,822 --> 01:18:39,983
l had to tell him.

1012
01:18:40,191 --> 01:18:41,715
With the stuntman!

1013
01:18:41,926 --> 01:18:46,056
l'd drop a guy for a film.
l'd never drop a film for a guy!

1014
01:20:52,056 --> 01:20:53,455
Can you manage?

1015
01:20:56,127 --> 01:20:57,890
l'll explain....

1016
01:20:58,429 --> 01:21:03,162
We built this to convey that
you live across from your in-laws.

1017
01:21:06,437 --> 01:21:08,837
l'll cue you,
as Alphonse isn't here.

1018
01:21:08,973 --> 01:21:11,237
He's in love,
so we're in a pickle!

1019
01:21:11,375 --> 01:21:14,071
Good title. ''The Pickles of Love.''

1020
01:21:19,750 --> 01:21:21,741
Rise and shine, kids!

1021
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:25,452
Come have breakfast with us!

1022
01:21:25,656 --> 01:21:27,089
Alphonse is in bed.

1023
01:21:27,224 --> 01:21:28,589
Next line, Julie!

1024
01:21:28,793 --> 01:21:30,590
We're invited over.

1025
01:21:32,229 --> 01:21:33,890
We'll be right there.

1026
01:21:34,098 --> 01:21:35,588
Cut! Once more!

1027
01:21:38,936 --> 01:21:41,530
Come have breakfast with us!

1028
01:21:41,739 --> 01:21:43,172
Alphonse is asleep.

1029
01:21:43,374 --> 01:21:45,274
No, no...''in bed.''

1030
01:21:45,476 --> 01:21:47,808
We're invited over.

1031
01:22:57,915 --> 01:23:02,409
l know you're in there!
Open up. Everyone's asking for you.

1032
01:23:02,620 --> 01:23:03,678
They are not!

1033
01:23:03,888 --> 01:23:06,356
Severine leaves for ltaly tonight.

1034
01:23:06,557 --> 01:23:09,390
l don't want to see anyone!

1035
01:23:11,262 --> 01:23:14,425
This actor had always dreamed
of playing Hamlet.

1036
01:23:14,632 --> 01:23:17,624
At last
he staged it and played the role!

1037
01:23:17,835 --> 01:23:23,034
But he was so bad,
he was booed every night.

1038
01:23:23,240 --> 01:23:25,140
One night he was fed up...

1039
01:23:25,342 --> 01:23:29,711
...he stopped in the middle
of ''To be or not to be....''

1040
01:23:29,914 --> 01:23:33,611
Turning to the audience, he said....

1041
01:23:42,359 --> 01:23:44,759
The champagne, at last!

1042
01:23:44,962 --> 01:23:48,295
You still have to finish Pamela!

1043
01:23:48,499 --> 01:23:50,990
l'm so sad to be leaving.

1044
01:23:51,202 --> 01:23:54,103
Come join us, machos!

1045
01:23:54,305 --> 01:23:57,103
Move your table!

1046
01:23:57,508 --> 01:24:00,773
Why are you all alone over there?

1047
01:24:00,978 --> 01:24:04,539
Are you sad, in love, heartbroken?

1048
01:24:04,748 --> 01:24:07,114
Don't! He's just a hotel guest.

1049
01:24:07,318 --> 01:24:08,910
So what?

1050
01:24:09,119 --> 01:24:12,054
Come join us, Mr. Hotel Guest!

1051
01:24:12,756 --> 01:24:16,021
We're a movie crew
having a farewell party.

1052
01:24:16,227 --> 01:24:17,956
l'll introduce you.

1053
01:24:30,374 --> 01:24:31,739
Can l talk to you?

1054
01:24:35,112 --> 01:24:37,478
l think we should get Alphonse.

1055
01:24:37,681 --> 01:24:41,344
He's locked in his room, sulking!
He's a drag.

1056
01:24:41,485 --> 01:24:42,543
That's unfair.

1057
01:24:42,686 --> 01:24:46,087
l've known him for ages.
Never fails!

1058
01:24:46,290 --> 01:24:47,757
Then l'll go.

1059
01:24:47,891 --> 01:24:49,483
l'll try again.

1060
01:24:49,627 --> 01:24:52,892
Come see the great photos!

1061
01:24:56,200 --> 01:24:57,462
She's so cute.

1062
01:24:57,601 --> 01:24:58,966
She's not! Out!

1063
01:25:06,043 --> 01:25:08,204
What a funny life we lead!

1064
01:25:08,812 --> 01:25:14,250
We meet, we work together,
we love each other, and then....

1065
01:25:14,451 --> 01:25:17,284
As soon as we grasp something....

1066
01:25:18,422 --> 01:25:21,084
lt's gone! See?

1067
01:25:22,693 --> 01:25:27,528
Severine is extraordinary.
We made a film together in ltaly.

1068
01:25:27,665 --> 01:25:31,294
She was so good,
the director kept saying...

1069
01:25:31,435 --> 01:25:34,302
...''She's greater than Eleonora Duse!''

1070
01:25:34,438 --> 01:25:37,532
So l called her ''Superduse'' !

1071
01:25:47,117 --> 01:25:48,379
Seen Alphonse?

1072
01:25:48,519 --> 01:25:52,785
He's locked in and won't come out.

1073
01:25:52,923 --> 01:25:54,891
Well, Severine's gone, so--

1074
01:25:59,129 --> 01:26:02,223
l need money to go to a whorehouse.

1075
01:26:02,366 --> 01:26:04,596
Come on, Alphonse.

1076
01:26:04,902 --> 01:26:07,769
Go back to your room,
re-read the script...

1077
01:26:07,905 --> 01:26:10,237
...learn your lines,
then try to sleep.

1078
01:26:10,374 --> 01:26:13,866
Tomorrow we work.
That's what matters.

1079
01:26:14,011 --> 01:26:15,239
Don't be a fool.

1080
01:26:16,413 --> 01:26:18,347
You're a very good actor.

1081
01:26:18,482 --> 01:26:23,385
No one's private life runs smoothly.
That only happens in the movies.

1082
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:26,148
No traffic jams, no dead periods.

1083
01:26:26,290 --> 01:26:29,453
Movies go along
like trains in the night.

1084
01:26:29,593 --> 01:26:31,322
And people like you and me...

1085
01:26:31,462 --> 01:26:34,158
...are only happy in our work.

1086
01:26:34,298 --> 01:26:36,323
l'm counting on you.

1087
01:26:41,438 --> 01:26:45,636
Which costume
shall l choose for Saturday?

1088
01:26:56,920 --> 01:27:00,412
Switch the call from 22 7 to 4 1 5.

1089
01:27:06,230 --> 01:27:08,095
It's Alphonse.

1090
01:27:08,232 --> 01:27:10,928
I wanted to tell you
I'm leaving tonight.

1091
01:27:11,068 --> 01:27:15,004
You've always been my friend.
Tell Ferrand for me.

1092
01:27:15,139 --> 01:27:17,630
l have to talk to you. Wait!

1093
01:27:17,841 --> 01:27:19,172
Goodbye and thanks.

1094
01:27:19,309 --> 01:27:20,799
Wait for me!

1095
01:27:39,530 --> 01:27:42,522
What is all this? You can't leave.

1096
01:27:43,267 --> 01:27:45,701
l am, l'm giving it all up.

1097
01:27:46,103 --> 01:27:49,095
You'll stay and finish the film.

1098
01:27:49,306 --> 01:27:52,366
Even if l stayed,
l'm too upset to work!

1099
01:27:52,576 --> 01:27:54,441
l'm a physical wreck.

1100
01:27:55,646 --> 01:28:00,845
ls it normal for someone to stop
loving you and just walk out?

1101
01:28:01,051 --> 01:28:03,417
Then it was all phony,
sickening!

1102
01:28:03,620 --> 01:28:07,454
l know how much
you've been hurt.

1103
01:28:07,658 --> 01:28:10,320
But l think Liliane still loves you.

1104
01:28:10,861 --> 01:28:13,386
You're being selfish too.

1105
01:28:13,597 --> 01:28:18,398
You know it's difficult for an
outsider to live with an actor.

1106
01:28:18,602 --> 01:28:23,198
But to leave with just anyone!
Some Brit stuntman!

1107
01:28:23,407 --> 01:28:25,932
Careful! l'm a Brit too.

1108
01:28:26,143 --> 01:28:28,475
And l know those stuntmen.

1109
01:28:28,679 --> 01:28:33,139
You know
what'll happen to their affair.

1110
01:28:33,350 --> 01:28:37,013
At first, he'll take her
everywhere with him.

1111
01:28:37,221 --> 01:28:42,158
Then he'll get bored and she'll feel
lost all alone in London.

1112
01:28:42,359 --> 01:28:44,884
She'll be back in two weeks.

1113
01:28:45,095 --> 01:28:46,585
Think so?

1114
01:28:46,797 --> 01:28:50,995
Anyway, it's over now.
l'd rather suffer.

1115
01:28:52,369 --> 01:28:56,169
You see,
l've made a terrible discovery.

1116
01:28:56,373 --> 01:28:59,604
You can be desperately in love...

1117
01:28:59,943 --> 01:29:01,604
...with someone you despise.

1118
01:29:01,745 --> 01:29:05,203
Whose every gesture,
word and thought you detest!

1119
01:29:05,415 --> 01:29:08,282
What right have you to say that?

1120
01:29:08,485 --> 01:29:12,888
Say you made a mistake, but never
be ashamed of having loved!

1121
01:29:13,090 --> 01:29:16,582
By despising Liliane
you're merely...

1122
01:29:17,227 --> 01:29:18,592
...degrading yourself.

1123
01:29:18,795 --> 01:29:20,729
Maybe you're right.

1124
01:29:20,931 --> 01:29:24,867
Anyway, my love-affairs
have always ended badly.

1125
01:29:25,068 --> 01:29:26,865
l thought women were magic.

1126
01:29:27,004 --> 01:29:30,838
Of course they're not magic.
Or men are too.

1127
01:29:31,041 --> 01:29:33,407
Everyone's magic, and no one is.

1128
01:29:34,878 --> 01:29:38,871
l'm sure Ferrand is wrong.
Life is more important than films.

1129
01:29:39,049 --> 01:29:41,244
l'm going now. Thank you.

1130
01:29:41,451 --> 01:29:45,785
Don't be a fool.
Stay and finish your work.

1131
01:30:04,474 --> 01:30:06,465
ls that clock working?

1132
01:30:06,677 --> 01:30:09,840
lt's 6 a.m.! Time to make coffee!

1133
01:30:28,599 --> 01:30:30,499
Have you seen Julie?

1134
01:30:30,701 --> 01:30:32,498
l'm looking for Lajoie!

1135
01:30:32,703 --> 01:30:34,466
Know what that idiot did?

1136
01:30:34,671 --> 01:30:38,266
Mixed up his dates
and sent the costumes back!

1137
01:30:38,475 --> 01:30:40,375
So you've been up for hours?

1138
01:30:40,577 --> 01:30:44,206
All night, getting the costumes
from the airport.

1139
01:30:44,414 --> 01:30:45,904
Or no shooting today!

1140
01:30:46,116 --> 01:30:49,711
-Where could Julie be?
-ln her room?

1141
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:52,753
Her bed hasn't been slept in.

1142
01:30:52,956 --> 01:30:55,948
Everyone's nuts on this movie!

1143
01:31:24,488 --> 01:31:26,683
-What time is it?
-6 a.m.

1144
01:31:26,890 --> 01:31:29,859
-Where you going?
-To work.

1145
01:31:30,060 --> 01:31:33,689
You can sleep two more hours.
l set the alarm.

1146
01:31:34,765 --> 01:31:35,857
Stay with me.

1147
01:31:36,066 --> 01:31:37,397
l can't.

1148
01:31:40,037 --> 01:31:43,666
l have a makeup call
for the costume party scene.

1149
01:31:43,874 --> 01:31:45,307
Wait!

1150
01:31:46,076 --> 01:31:47,134
Kiss me.

1151
01:31:51,615 --> 01:31:52,946
You won't forget?

1152
01:31:53,150 --> 01:31:56,847
We'll go away together
when the film's done.

1153
01:31:57,554 --> 01:31:58,885
Sleep.

1154
01:32:49,740 --> 01:32:52,937
Dr. Nelson? lt's Alphonse.

1155
01:32:54,544 --> 01:32:56,478
l have something to tell you.

1156
01:32:56,613 --> 01:33:00,947
l love your wife.
l slept with her. Set her free!

1157
01:33:14,664 --> 01:33:17,292
Julie, call for you.

1158
01:33:17,501 --> 01:33:19,401
l think it's your husband.

1159
01:33:43,160 --> 01:33:45,628
-You owe me for this bill!
-Not now!

1160
01:33:45,796 --> 01:33:47,388
Later it'll be too late!

1161
01:33:47,531 --> 01:33:50,989
You looked everywhere?
He's not in his room?

1162
01:33:52,502 --> 01:33:56,302
Alphonse has disappeared!

1163
01:33:57,040 --> 01:33:58,905
Could he have gone to Paris?

1164
01:33:59,109 --> 01:34:02,101
There are flights at 8:50 and 1 0:1 0.

1165
01:34:02,312 --> 01:34:03,904
Call the airport.

1166
01:34:04,114 --> 01:34:06,207
You call, l'll go.

1167
01:34:06,416 --> 01:34:08,976
lf he's there, l'll bring him back.

1168
01:34:12,589 --> 01:34:15,717
-We've got trouble!
-l know, Alphonse is gone.

1169
01:34:15,859 --> 01:34:18,293
l mean Julie! Nerves, l guess.

1170
01:34:18,495 --> 01:34:21,396
She locked herself in,
won't see anyone.

1171
01:34:21,598 --> 01:34:23,190
You can hear her crying.

1172
01:34:23,900 --> 01:34:26,164
l hope it's not another breakdown!

1173
01:34:26,369 --> 01:34:27,927
Let's go see.

1174
01:34:28,405 --> 01:34:29,872
There's Odile.

1175
01:34:30,240 --> 01:34:33,676
She got a call from Dr. Nelson,
l think.

1176
01:34:33,877 --> 01:34:36,937
She asked me to leave,
and locked the door.

1177
01:34:37,147 --> 01:34:38,671
lt's me, open the door!

1178
01:34:38,849 --> 01:34:41,147
Open up, we're your friends!

1179
01:34:41,351 --> 01:34:43,512
As producer, l want to help you.

1180
01:34:43,653 --> 01:34:45,348
Quiet!

1181
01:34:45,555 --> 01:34:47,489
You don't think she'd...?

1182
01:34:50,093 --> 01:34:53,358
-Will she talk to you?
-She won't open the door.

1183
01:34:53,530 --> 01:34:55,760
You can hear her crying.

1184
01:35:04,441 --> 01:35:08,309
She keeps us out,
and lets Stacey in!

1185
01:35:08,511 --> 01:35:10,911
Motherhood has its privileges.

1186
01:35:11,114 --> 01:35:16,074
We can't find Alphonse anywhere.

1187
01:35:16,286 --> 01:35:18,618
Julie didn't sleep in her room.

1188
01:35:18,822 --> 01:35:22,223
Alphonse disappears,
Dr. Nelson calls.

1189
01:35:22,392 --> 01:35:24,189
The picture's pretty clear!

1190
01:35:25,028 --> 01:35:29,294
What is this movie business?
Where everyone sleeps with everyone!

1191
01:35:29,499 --> 01:35:31,660
Everyone lies!

1192
01:35:31,868 --> 01:35:35,895
Do you think it's normal?
Your movie world...

1193
01:35:36,106 --> 01:35:37,801
...l think it stinks!

1194
01:35:38,008 --> 01:35:39,100
l despise it!

1195
01:35:39,309 --> 01:35:42,506
Lajoie, calm your wife down!

1196
01:35:49,085 --> 01:35:50,643
That woman's wrong.

1197
01:35:50,854 --> 01:35:53,948
Movie people may be
more obvious about it...

1198
01:35:54,157 --> 01:35:57,024
...but love makes
the world go round!

1199
01:35:57,227 --> 01:35:59,491
She wants tub butter.

1200
01:35:59,696 --> 01:36:02,028
Country butter, in bulk.

1201
01:36:02,198 --> 01:36:04,257
ls she crazy? What's she doing?

1202
01:36:04,467 --> 01:36:08,767
Crying. She'll stop,
but find her some tub butter!

1203
01:36:08,972 --> 01:36:12,931
Find some tub butter.

1204
01:36:13,143 --> 01:36:16,010
No way! lt's not in the script!

1205
01:36:16,212 --> 01:36:18,180
That's not nice, or friendly!

1206
01:36:18,381 --> 01:36:20,110
Aren't we one big family?

1207
01:36:20,317 --> 01:36:23,218
So were the people
in Greek tragedies!

1208
01:36:23,486 --> 01:36:26,455
Tub butter!
All right, l'll find it myself.

1209
01:36:27,724 --> 01:36:29,851
He's really quite lucky.

1210
01:36:30,060 --> 01:36:33,086
Some whims are more expensive!

1211
01:36:33,296 --> 01:36:36,697
There was an Austrian actress,
Hedy Lamarr...

1212
01:36:36,900 --> 01:36:39,300
...became a big Hollywood star.

1213
01:36:39,502 --> 01:36:44,166
She really missed the rainy climate
of her native Tyrol.

1214
01:36:44,574 --> 01:36:48,374
So, in her garden in California,
she installed...

1215
01:36:48,578 --> 01:36:51,376
...a rain-making machine.

1216
01:36:51,581 --> 01:36:55,017
So a little thing like tub butter....

1217
01:36:55,218 --> 01:36:59,120
Come help me!
This is all l could find.

1218
01:36:59,322 --> 01:37:00,346
That's not it!

1219
01:37:00,490 --> 01:37:03,425
There's no tub butter
on the whole Riviera!

1220
01:37:03,626 --> 01:37:06,186
So we'll knead this
into one block...

1221
01:37:06,396 --> 01:37:10,992
...wrap it in gauze,
and it'll look like it!

1222
01:37:11,301 --> 01:37:12,495
Think it'll work?

1223
01:37:12,702 --> 01:37:14,761
lt has to.
What a business!

1224
01:37:18,308 --> 01:37:20,936
l found Alphonse. Where?

1225
01:37:21,077 --> 01:37:24,240
You'll never guess!
l'll bring him in.

1226
01:37:36,726 --> 01:37:37,988
There you are!

1227
01:37:38,194 --> 01:37:42,358
Here's the famous tub butter.
l won't deliver it!

1228
01:37:42,532 --> 01:37:45,194
No! Like the chef
in Rules of the Game...

1229
01:37:45,335 --> 01:37:47,769
...''l cater to diets, but not fads!''

1230
01:38:05,188 --> 01:38:07,986
Here's what you asked for.

1231
01:38:08,191 --> 01:38:10,091
You didn't!

1232
01:38:12,429 --> 01:38:13,896
Forgive me.

1233
01:38:14,097 --> 01:38:16,327
l'm so ashamed!

1234
01:38:16,533 --> 01:38:19,525
l'll be all right in a minute.

1235
01:38:19,736 --> 01:38:22,330
l know it's not very professional.

1236
01:38:22,539 --> 01:38:26,635
l don't like being like this,
holding you up.

1237
01:38:26,843 --> 01:38:29,311
lt's all right, we can wait awhile.

1238
01:38:29,512 --> 01:38:32,174
We'll change the schedule.

1239
01:38:32,382 --> 01:38:36,079
Don't change it because of me!

1240
01:38:36,953 --> 01:38:39,751
l'll be all right in a minute.

1241
01:38:41,925 --> 01:38:44,860
Can you lend me a handkerchief?

1242
01:38:46,629 --> 01:38:48,358
l must look awful.

1243
01:38:51,968 --> 01:38:55,836
Why did Alphonse do it?
He didn't understand anything!

1244
01:38:56,039 --> 01:38:58,405
He acted like the child he is.

1245
01:38:58,608 --> 01:39:03,807
l saw enough of your husband
to know he's a wonderful man.

1246
01:39:04,013 --> 01:39:05,708
Yes, he is.

1247
01:39:05,915 --> 01:39:08,543
But you don't know the whole story.

1248
01:39:10,820 --> 01:39:13,414
When l had my breakdown...

1249
01:39:13,623 --> 01:39:15,887
...he did a very serious thing.

1250
01:39:16,092 --> 01:39:19,425
He left his wife and children.

1251
01:39:19,629 --> 01:39:23,861
He gave up a life
it took him 20 years to create.

1252
01:39:24,067 --> 01:39:25,500
He did that for me.

1253
01:39:25,702 --> 01:39:27,363
He devoted himself to me.

1254
01:39:27,504 --> 01:39:31,873
He tried to make me
into a responsible adult.

1255
01:39:32,075 --> 01:39:36,910
Now he must think
it was an awful waste.

1256
01:39:37,113 --> 01:39:40,344
No, when he knows what happened...

1257
01:39:40,550 --> 01:39:44,179
...he'll understand.
He'll forget, it'll be over.

1258
01:39:44,387 --> 01:39:49,916
You think so? Even if that's true,
l'll never forget.

1259
01:39:50,126 --> 01:39:53,459
Thanks to him,
l know l can change my life.

1260
01:39:54,330 --> 01:39:59,859
l've decided to live alone.
l'm sick of disguises.

1261
01:40:00,069 --> 01:40:01,798
l'm quitting movies.

1262
01:40:02,005 --> 01:40:04,337
l know that life is rotten.

1263
01:40:06,843 --> 01:40:10,244
Since we can't shoot,
we'll record some wild tracks.

1264
01:40:10,446 --> 01:40:14,246
-Ready, René?
-Okay. Applause first.

1265
01:40:20,089 --> 01:40:22,080
Now some background talk.

1266
01:40:23,059 --> 01:40:24,993
Don't discuss movies!

1267
01:40:31,100 --> 01:40:33,967
Now more applause.

1268
01:40:47,817 --> 01:40:51,048
Julie's dressing room
is upstairs-right.

1269
01:40:55,191 --> 01:40:58,490
l called him and he agreed to come!

1270
01:41:16,112 --> 01:41:18,637
l really screwed up.

1271
01:41:18,848 --> 01:41:21,749
What can l say to Julie
when l see her?

1272
01:41:21,951 --> 01:41:26,820
-Should l apologize?
-The less said, the better.

1273
01:41:28,291 --> 01:41:31,522
l've made up my mind.
l'm quitting movies.

1274
01:41:31,728 --> 01:41:34,891
That's a good idea, you do that!

1275
01:41:40,303 --> 01:41:42,168
Are you seeing Julie?

1276
01:41:42,372 --> 01:41:45,933
Give her this new dialogue
for the scene.

1277
01:41:46,142 --> 01:41:48,110
She's to learn it.

1278
01:42:25,481 --> 01:42:28,541
Can l fix your makeup now?

1279
01:42:31,254 --> 01:42:35,918
l'm fine now.
We'll make ourselves beautiful!

1280
01:42:41,798 --> 01:42:46,462
This is your new dialogue
for the scene.

1281
01:42:49,739 --> 01:42:53,732
''Even if that's true,
l'll never forget.

1282
01:42:54,877 --> 01:42:57,437
l've decided to live alone.

1283
01:42:57,647 --> 01:42:59,581
l know that life is rotten.''

1284
01:42:59,782 --> 01:43:02,148
He's got some nerve!

1285
01:43:04,087 --> 01:43:05,748
Are you all right, Julie?

1286
01:43:05,888 --> 01:43:07,321
Let's do it!

1287
01:43:09,292 --> 01:43:14,662
l've decided to live alone.
l know that life is rotten.

1288
01:43:14,864 --> 01:43:17,662
No, it isn't.

1289
01:43:54,303 --> 01:43:56,703
Cut! Once more, for the hands.

1290
01:43:56,906 --> 01:43:59,500
The candle okay?

1291
01:43:59,709 --> 01:44:04,112
-Places.
-Places, and quiet please!

1292
01:44:07,150 --> 01:44:09,983
l'll caress her with this hand.

1293
01:44:10,887 --> 01:44:12,411
Places.

1294
01:44:14,023 --> 01:44:15,684
And let's do it.

1295
01:44:26,002 --> 01:44:29,165
l've decided to live alone.

1296
01:44:29,372 --> 01:44:31,363
l know that life is rotten.

1297
01:44:31,574 --> 01:44:34,543
No, it isn't.

1298
01:45:12,882 --> 01:45:15,680
Cut. That was the best one!

1299
01:45:15,885 --> 01:45:18,251
Alexander is dead!
A car accident.

1300
01:45:18,988 --> 01:45:21,957
Returning from the airport...

1301
01:45:22,225 --> 01:45:24,887
...where he went to meet Christian.

1302
01:45:25,294 --> 01:45:27,558
A truck hit their car.

1303
01:45:28,231 --> 01:45:32,133
Christian is badly hurt,
but he'll recover.

1304
01:45:32,702 --> 01:45:34,397
Alexander died...

1305
01:45:35,171 --> 01:45:37,435
...on the way to the hospital.

1306
01:45:40,576 --> 01:45:44,171
Alexander was buried
in a little cemetery above Nice.

1307
01:45:44,380 --> 01:45:48,908
Now the film's fate was in the hands
of the English insurers.

1308
01:45:49,285 --> 01:45:52,152
What I always feared had happened:

1309
01:45:52,355 --> 01:45:54,846
a production halted by death.

1310
01:45:56,792 --> 01:45:59,761
The era of studio movies
died with Alexander.

1311
01:45:59,962 --> 01:46:03,989
Films will be shot in the streets,
without stars or scripts.

1312
01:46:04,200 --> 01:46:07,499
There will be no more films
like Meet Pamela.

1313
01:46:21,717 --> 01:46:23,048
Hello, Pamela!

1314
01:46:23,252 --> 01:46:25,812
Come have breakfast with us!

1315
01:46:25,955 --> 01:46:27,752
Alphonse is still asleep!

1316
01:46:27,890 --> 01:46:29,721
No, no...''in bed.''

1317
01:46:29,926 --> 01:46:31,587
We're invited over.

1318
01:46:32,562 --> 01:46:34,257
We'll be right there.

1319
01:46:34,463 --> 01:46:37,125
-Was that okay?
-Fine. Cut!

1320
01:46:37,333 --> 01:46:39,358
Wait, l'm coming over!

1321
01:46:44,273 --> 01:46:46,798
l was afraid
he might have an accident.

1322
01:46:47,009 --> 01:46:49,534
l offered him a driver.

1323
01:46:50,246 --> 01:46:53,977
He wasn't at home anywhere.

1324
01:46:54,784 --> 01:46:59,050
Always rushing off somewhere.
A man in a hurry.

1325
01:46:59,355 --> 01:47:01,619
No, he was at home everywhere.

1326
01:47:01,824 --> 01:47:04,486
He liked people,
he lived for the moment.

1327
01:47:04,694 --> 01:47:09,654
He couldn't leave places.
He was rushing back not to be late.

1328
01:47:09,865 --> 01:47:12,925
You could say
he died out of generosity.

1329
01:47:13,135 --> 01:47:14,830
You may be right.

1330
01:47:15,638 --> 01:47:18,072
Now we have to finish the film.

1331
01:47:19,342 --> 01:47:23,244
What does
the insurance company say?

1332
01:47:38,628 --> 01:47:42,086
Mr. Johanson talked at length
to London last night.

1333
01:47:42,298 --> 01:47:47,133
You can't re-shoot Alexander's
scenes with another actor.

1334
01:47:47,336 --> 01:47:50,271
The only solution
is to simplify the script...

1335
01:47:50,473 --> 01:47:53,738
...and finish shooting
in five days instead of two weeks.

1336
01:47:53,943 --> 01:47:56,639
Then the insurance
will cover everything.

1337
01:47:56,779 --> 01:47:58,076
Five days!

1338
01:47:58,280 --> 01:48:00,578
We'll have to simplify things.

1339
01:48:00,783 --> 01:48:05,516
We'll leave Alexander
out of the costume party scene.

1340
01:48:05,721 --> 01:48:10,681
Then the shot with the candles
makes no sense any more.

1341
01:48:10,893 --> 01:48:15,455
We'll cut the costume party scene.
The story works without it.

1342
01:48:15,665 --> 01:48:20,864
Then the only important scene left
is when Alphonse kills his father.

1343
01:48:21,070 --> 01:48:26,406
We can shoot it in the street
and hire a stand-in for Alexander.

1344
01:48:26,609 --> 01:48:30,841
lt won't work, unless Alphonse
shoots him in the back.

1345
01:48:31,047 --> 01:48:33,413
Why not? ln the back!

1346
01:48:33,616 --> 01:48:35,948
lt's better, far more violent.

1347
01:48:36,152 --> 01:48:39,485
Why not have it all take place
in the snow?

1348
01:49:11,287 --> 01:49:13,312
All right, Walter.

1349
01:49:13,522 --> 01:49:14,921
Just like last time.

1350
01:49:15,124 --> 01:49:18,924
But we'll be closer
on Alphonse this time.

1351
01:49:19,128 --> 01:49:22,188
But we have to see the gun.

1352
01:49:22,398 --> 01:49:24,696
Here's the stand-in.

1353
01:49:27,169 --> 01:49:30,570
Could you walk away?
We have to see how you look.

1354
01:49:31,240 --> 01:49:32,969
Too much hair on the neck.

1355
01:49:33,109 --> 01:49:34,838
lt has to work!

1356
01:49:35,044 --> 01:49:37,604
That's Alexander's stand-in.

1357
01:49:37,813 --> 01:49:41,214
Trim his hair more like Alexander's.

1358
01:49:42,017 --> 01:49:45,646
This is the gun you wanted
for Alphonse, right?

1359
01:49:45,855 --> 01:49:48,085
lf that's the one l chose, sure.

1360
01:49:50,392 --> 01:49:54,419
Places, everybody. Hurry!

1361
01:49:55,965 --> 01:50:01,426
Hurry, please!
To the places l showed you!

1362
01:50:02,404 --> 01:50:05,703
l don't want the snow
too white or too clean.

1363
01:50:05,908 --> 01:50:10,174
Don't worry, l'll fix it
like in ''The Snow Was Black.''

1364
01:50:12,615 --> 01:50:16,517
l've been offered a movie in Tokyo.
l want to accept.

1365
01:50:16,685 --> 01:50:19,153
Turgenev's First Love,
a good story.

1366
01:50:19,321 --> 01:50:20,515
For a movie?

1367
01:50:20,723 --> 01:50:24,955
With a Japanese girl
and you as the Frenchman, sure!

1368
01:50:25,161 --> 01:50:29,291
l'll do it because it's Tokyo.
1 3,000 miles from my problems!

1369
01:50:29,498 --> 01:50:33,867
Should l hold the gun like this?
Or like that?

1370
01:50:34,069 --> 01:50:36,765
Like that.
So it's seen against the snow.

1371
01:50:37,439 --> 01:50:40,533
Dr. Nelson and Julie
want to say goodbye.

1372
01:50:40,743 --> 01:50:44,144
-Off to London?
-Australia! A medical conference.

1373
01:50:44,346 --> 01:50:47,213
Be ready to shoot when l get back!

1374
01:50:53,322 --> 01:50:56,120
See you in Paris for the post-sync!

1375
01:51:04,366 --> 01:51:06,664
Let's go before it gets dark!

1376
01:51:22,151 --> 01:51:24,085
-Good luck.
-You too.

1377
01:51:50,079 --> 01:51:51,478
More discreetly!

1378
01:51:56,752 --> 01:51:58,242
Walk faster!

1379
01:52:03,125 --> 01:52:04,387
The gun!

1380
01:52:07,263 --> 01:52:08,525
Run away!

1381
01:52:10,065 --> 01:52:11,930
Run to the far end!

1382
01:52:39,962 --> 01:52:44,058
Cut! Shooting's over!
Thanks, everyone!

1383
01:52:57,579 --> 01:52:59,012
Going back to Paris?

1384
01:52:59,214 --> 01:53:01,944
No, l'm staying around here
for a rest.

1385
01:53:02,084 --> 01:53:03,551
Have a nice rest.

1386
01:53:04,687 --> 01:53:07,747
My car was wrecked in the stunt.

1387
01:53:07,957 --> 01:53:11,552
l've got another one in Paris,
but l need a ride.

1388
01:53:11,694 --> 01:53:15,186
With me? lmpossible!
lt's full of my gear.

1389
01:53:15,397 --> 01:53:17,831
Anyway, l like to be independent!

1390
01:53:18,801 --> 01:53:20,291
Yann, wait for me!

1391
01:53:22,204 --> 01:53:25,901
See you in the bread line!
Unemployment, here we come!

1392
01:53:28,210 --> 01:53:30,678
l'm taking Odile to meet my folks.

1393
01:53:30,879 --> 01:53:32,346
We're getting married.

1394
01:53:32,548 --> 01:53:37,076
Well, very cagey of you!
l bet no one suspected.

1395
01:53:37,286 --> 01:53:40,744
She's experienced and l'm not.
A happy medium!

1396
01:53:40,956 --> 01:53:43,789
All the best, congratulations.

1397
01:53:46,962 --> 01:53:49,362
And thanks. Great camera work!

1398
01:53:49,498 --> 01:53:50,624
Glad you like it.

1399
01:53:50,833 --> 01:53:52,926
Bye, kids! Have a nice trip.

1400
01:53:54,370 --> 01:53:56,930
Drive carefully!

1401
01:53:57,139 --> 01:53:59,801
Could you talk to us
about Alexander?

1402
01:54:00,009 --> 01:54:03,638
No, it's too personal.
Ask Bertrand, the producer.

1403
01:54:03,846 --> 01:54:05,541
-He refused.
-Alphonse?

1404
01:54:05,748 --> 01:54:09,013
-He won't talk about death!
-Sorry.

1405
01:54:09,218 --> 01:54:11,243
l'll talk to you!

1406
01:54:14,690 --> 01:54:15,748
Got him framed?

1407
01:54:15,891 --> 01:54:18,382
-Who's he?
-Props, l think.

1408
01:54:19,328 --> 01:54:21,922
Wasn't it a hard film to make?

1409
01:54:22,131 --> 01:54:24,827
Lots of trouble during the shooting?

1410
01:54:25,034 --> 01:54:26,865
Not at all! lt went fine!

1411
01:54:27,069 --> 01:54:28,934
And we hope audiences...

1412
01:54:29,138 --> 01:54:32,266
...enjoy seeing it
as much as we enjoyed making it!
