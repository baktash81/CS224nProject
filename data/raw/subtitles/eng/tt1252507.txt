1
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:15,149
- [Voiceover] Joe! (Man cries)

2
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:25,659
- Please, god,

3
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:32,866
if Joe's alive,
just let me know.

4
00:00:33,834 --> 00:00:36,770
Give me some kind of a sign
that my son is not dead.

5
00:00:46,247 --> 00:00:49,217
- [Voiceover] Orders for the
30-foot section (mumbles).

6
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:50,684
- [Voiceover] Yes, on Monday.

7
00:00:50,718 --> 00:00:52,096
- [Voiceover] Okay, I'm about
to finish the corrections

8
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,354
of the McNally plans.

9
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:54,664
- [Voiceover] Carl
can take care of it.

10
00:00:54,688 --> 00:00:55,923
You need to get out of here.

11
00:00:55,956 --> 00:00:57,525
- [Voiceover] Carl
has his hands full

12
00:00:57,558 --> 00:00:59,093
with the cedar town job.

13
00:00:59,593 --> 00:01:01,071
- [Voiceover] Randy, I promise
the place won't fall apart

14
00:01:01,095 --> 00:01:02,296
while you're gone,

15
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:04,332
and your wife's still
holding on line two.

16
00:01:04,365 --> 00:01:06,066
- [Voiceover] Okay,
put her through.

17
00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:13,774
(Phone rings)

18
00:01:15,042 --> 00:01:16,244
- Hello.

19
00:01:16,277 --> 00:01:18,412
- Don't tell me you're
still at the office.

20
00:01:18,446 --> 00:01:19,947
- All right, I won't tell you.

21
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:22,816
- Dang it, Randy, you promised
you'd help me pack the Van.

22
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:24,428
We're supposed to pick
up Zack and Tucker

23
00:01:24,452 --> 00:01:25,819
from school at 11:00.

24
00:01:25,853 --> 00:01:27,288
- I know. I'm wrapping it up.

25
00:01:27,321 --> 00:01:29,823
- You also promised you weren't
gonna go into work today.

26
00:01:29,857 --> 00:01:32,193
That's what this
trip is all about.

27
00:01:32,226 --> 00:01:34,495
- Okay, I'm leaving now.

28
00:01:34,528 --> 00:01:36,297
- Fine, bye.

29
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:59,320
(Dog barks)

30
00:01:59,353 --> 00:02:01,689
- Tater, Cleo, cut it out!

31
00:02:02,723 --> 00:02:03,591
Come on.

32
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:04,992
- [Voiceover] Daddy's home!

33
00:02:05,025 --> 00:02:06,905
- [Joe] Zoom, zoom, zoom.
- [Randy] There he is.

34
00:02:09,163 --> 00:02:10,097
- Daddy, daddy!

35
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,765
- Hey, buddy.

36
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:13,601
Hey, how you doing?

37
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:14,602
Wanna go to the beach?

38
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:16,670
- Yeah, I wanna see a shark.

39
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:18,672
- A shark, huh?

40
00:02:18,706 --> 00:02:21,642
Big Joe simpkins,
fearless shark hunter.

41
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,744
- (Giggles) Daddy.

42
00:02:24,044 --> 00:02:25,804
- Okay, I'm a great
white! I'm gonna get you!

43
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,481
I'm gonna get you!

44
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:31,185
Arr! Arr! (Makes scary noises)

45
00:02:31,219 --> 00:02:32,653
- Boom, boom!

46
00:02:32,686 --> 00:02:35,456
- Oh, you got a 25-footer.

47
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,392
Good job, buddy. Good job.

48
00:02:38,426 --> 00:02:39,260
Give me five.

49
00:02:39,293 --> 00:02:40,528
- Big shark dead.

50
00:02:42,696 --> 00:02:44,031
- I'm sorry, okay.

51
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,335
- Vacation's supposed
to be a chance for you

52
00:02:47,368 --> 00:02:49,503
to spend some time with
you family for a change.

53
00:02:49,537 --> 00:02:51,672
You're not getting off
to a very good start.

54
00:02:51,705 --> 00:02:53,541
- We haven't left yet.

55
00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:56,644
Okay, you're right.

56
00:02:57,778 --> 00:03:00,147
- I thought you were gonna
take that dog to the pound.

57
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,949
- I was. I just
haven't had time.

58
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:03,827
- Well, if he stays
here any longer,

59
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:05,386
Joe's never gonna
let you take him.

60
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:07,154
We don't need another dog.

61
00:03:08,556 --> 00:03:09,457
- Got it.

62
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:10,791
- I go to pawpaw's.

63
00:03:10,824 --> 00:03:11,859
- No.

64
00:03:11,892 --> 00:03:13,361
- I go to pawpaw's!

65
00:03:13,394 --> 00:03:15,396
- No! Joe, you're
staying right here.

66
00:03:15,429 --> 00:03:16,830
We're just about to leave.

67
00:03:17,631 --> 00:03:19,343
This is what I've been
dealing with all morning.

68
00:03:19,367 --> 00:03:20,510
This has got to be the
tenth time he's told me

69
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:21,935
he's going to pawpaw's.

70
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:24,405
- Hey, buddy, you can't go
to pawpaw's right now, okay,

71
00:03:24,438 --> 00:03:25,906
'cause pawpaw's out working.

72
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:27,751
- There's some bags inside the
door that need to be loaded.

73
00:03:27,775 --> 00:03:29,510
I'm gonna start
closing up the house.

74
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:31,879
You can go ahead and
buckle him up in the Van.

75
00:03:31,912 --> 00:03:34,548
- All right, come on,
buddy, you heard your momma.

76
00:03:34,582 --> 00:03:36,116
Let's get in the Van.

77
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:37,618
- I ride my bike.

78
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,164
- All right, well, you're
gonna be cooped up in here

79
00:03:41,188 --> 00:03:43,691
for a long time so go ahead,
but stay right here, okay.

80
00:03:44,292 --> 00:03:45,292
Okay?

81
00:03:45,493 --> 00:03:46,660
- [Joe] Okay, daddy.

82
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,409
- Whoa! Hey!

83
00:04:01,442 --> 00:04:03,402
Hey, buddy, you got a
license to drive that thing?

84
00:04:08,215 --> 00:04:09,583
- [Joe] Get daddy!

85
00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:12,986
Look out!

86
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,888
- Hey, you are a crazy driver!

87
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:18,492
- [Joe] (Giggles) I did it!

88
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,412
- What are you doing?

89
00:04:38,446 --> 00:04:39,913
- Just shutting
down the computer.

90
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:42,583
- No, you're not, you're
checking your work email.

91
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,818
- Let's not get into this again.

92
00:04:48,656 --> 00:04:49,757
- Okay.

93
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:53,427
I need to go to the bathroom.

94
00:04:54,094 --> 00:04:55,463
I'll meet you out there.

95
00:05:17,184 --> 00:05:18,486
- Joe!

96
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:25,993
Joe!

97
00:05:30,964 --> 00:05:31,999
Joe!

98
00:05:44,378 --> 00:05:45,946
Did Joe come inside with you?

99
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:47,648
- No. You didn't
put him in the Van?

100
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:50,183
- He was just out here riding
his trike a minute ago.

101
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:53,979
- Well, he probably
headed for your parents'.

102
00:05:55,489 --> 00:05:56,724
- He's never done that before.

103
00:05:56,757 --> 00:05:58,091
- How would you know?

104
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:00,193
He followed Zach and Tucker
there just last week.

105
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:04,398
- Joe! Joe!

106
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:06,299
- I'll check around here.

107
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:07,973
Why don't you check
the trail to pawpaw's?

108
00:06:08,636 --> 00:06:09,670
- Okay.

109
00:06:11,505 --> 00:06:13,040
- Joseph simpkins!

110
00:06:13,774 --> 00:06:16,276
You better get in this Van if
you know what's good for you!

111
00:06:56,684 --> 00:06:57,918
- Joe!

112
00:07:07,995 --> 00:07:09,096
- Joe!

113
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,506
(Phone rings)

114
00:07:21,241 --> 00:07:22,510
- Hello.

115
00:07:22,543 --> 00:07:24,845
- Hey, is Joe over
there with you?

116
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:27,948
- No, is there a problem?

117
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:30,851
- Well, we were just about to
pull out, and he disappeared.

118
00:07:30,884 --> 00:07:33,120
He's been telling me all day
he wants to go to pawpaw's.

119
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:35,055
- [Voiceover] I figured
he headed your way.

120
00:07:35,088 --> 00:07:37,057
- No, I'm looking out the back,

121
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:39,126
but all I see is Randy.

122
00:07:40,427 --> 00:07:42,038
- All right, just keep
an eye out for him.

123
00:07:42,062 --> 00:07:43,831
I'm gonna keep
looking around here.

124
00:07:43,864 --> 00:07:45,065
- Okay.

125
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,205
I just told christal
I haven't seen him.

126
00:07:52,239 --> 00:07:54,107
I'll check around the house.

127
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:55,809
I just hope he's okay.

128
00:07:55,843 --> 00:07:58,445
- I'm sure he is, momma. He'll
probably show up any minute.

129
00:07:59,046 --> 00:08:00,323
- I'm gonna go check sweetgrass.

130
00:08:00,347 --> 00:08:01,347
- Okay.

131
00:08:16,363 --> 00:08:17,931
- Joe, if you're hiding from me,

132
00:08:17,965 --> 00:08:19,909
you better come out now
or you'll get the whooping

133
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:21,468
you'll never forget!

134
00:08:33,313 --> 00:08:36,183
- Joseph simpkins, if you can
hear me, you better answer me!

135
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,171
Joe!

136
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:02,442
Joe!

137
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:09,416
- Joe!

138
00:09:21,461 --> 00:09:22,129
- Did you find him?

139
00:09:22,162 --> 00:09:23,463
- No.

140
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:25,232
- I checked the pond
behind mom and dad's.

141
00:09:25,265 --> 00:09:27,768
I checked the entire
sweetgrass yard.

142
00:09:27,801 --> 00:09:28,802
I don't understand it.

143
00:09:28,836 --> 00:09:30,137
He could not have gone that far.

144
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:31,805
- He's probably
just hiding from US,

145
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:32,982
thinking that this is a game.

146
00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:34,050
- That doesn't make any sense.

147
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:35,843
He knew we were about to leave.

148
00:09:35,876 --> 00:09:37,044
- Honey, he's two years old.

149
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:38,912
He doesn't do anything
that makes sense.

150
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:41,991
I guess I'll go check
with the neighbors,

151
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:43,651
see if he went visiting.

152
00:09:43,684 --> 00:09:45,518
I don't know where else
to check right now.

153
00:09:45,552 --> 00:09:47,387
I turned the house upside down.

154
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,189
- Yeah, I'll keep
checking the fields.

155
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:06,439
Joe!

156
00:10:31,164 --> 00:10:32,432
(Knocks on door)

157
00:10:36,536 --> 00:10:39,272
- Hello, christal, is
there something wrong?

158
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:40,741
- We can't find Joe.

159
00:10:40,774 --> 00:10:41,985
We were just about to
leave for vacation,

160
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:43,811
and he's just vanished.

161
00:10:43,844 --> 00:10:45,412
- Well, I haven't seen him.

162
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:46,622
- I was thinking
about your pool,

163
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,717
and how he always
want to come swimming.

164
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,219
- Oh, goodness, we don't
have the cover on it.

165
00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:04,732
- Okay, I'm gonna
continue up the street

166
00:11:04,765 --> 00:11:06,934
and check to see if
anybody else has seen him.

167
00:11:06,967 --> 00:11:08,201
Will you keep an eye out?

168
00:11:08,235 --> 00:11:10,270
- My older boy's home.
We'll look around.

169
00:11:10,303 --> 00:11:11,480
- Oh, I don't wanna be a bother.

170
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,774
- Don't be silly. He's your son.

171
00:11:13,807 --> 00:11:15,242
We need to find him.

172
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:16,376
- Thank you.

173
00:11:19,112 --> 00:11:20,347
- Joe!

174
00:11:26,887 --> 00:11:28,055
- [Randy] Joe!

175
00:11:34,261 --> 00:11:35,395
- [Voiceover] Joe!

176
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:36,908
- [Voiceover] Joe,
where are you, Joe?

177
00:11:37,765 --> 00:11:39,466
- [Voiceover] Joe,
can you hear me?

178
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:42,202
- [Voiceover] Joe!

179
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,476
- Any news yet?

180
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:50,787
- I checked with most
of the neighbors,

181
00:11:50,811 --> 00:11:52,746
and those who are out
are looking for him.

182
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,214
- I'll call Larry.

183
00:11:54,247 --> 00:11:55,487
He's with a crew in cedar town,

184
00:11:55,515 --> 00:11:57,484
but he'll wanna know
what's happening.

185
00:11:57,517 --> 00:12:00,487
- I'm gonna go by miss grace's
place, and then head home.

186
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,622
- Lord, I just hope
that little boy is okay.

187
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:05,158
- He better pray I don't wring
his neck when we find him.

188
00:12:15,202 --> 00:12:16,636
- Joe!

189
00:12:22,309 --> 00:12:23,443
Joe!

190
00:12:29,216 --> 00:12:30,717
- [Voiceover]
Carroll county 9-1-1.

191
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,219
Do you have an emergency?

192
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:33,787
- Yes.

193
00:12:33,821 --> 00:12:36,089
- [Voiceover] What is the
nature of your emergency, sir?

194
00:12:37,157 --> 00:12:38,691
- Our son is missing.

195
00:12:39,526 --> 00:12:40,904
- [Voiceover] What's
your name, sir?

196
00:12:40,928 --> 00:12:43,196
- Randy simpkins.
I'm his father.

197
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:44,507
- [Voiceover] Are you
currently at your residence

198
00:12:44,531 --> 00:12:46,566
on 1-5-0 wilderness trail?

199
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,001
- Yes.

200
00:12:48,035 --> 00:12:49,278
- [Voiceover] What is the
name and age of your child?

201
00:12:49,302 --> 00:12:52,272
- He's a two-year-old
boy. His name is Joe.

202
00:12:52,305 --> 00:12:53,606
He was playing on our driveway,

203
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,843
and then he just, he vanished.

204
00:12:55,876 --> 00:12:58,478
- [Voiceover] How long
has he been missing?

205
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:01,949
- Maybe, I guess 30
minutes, maybe 45 minutes.

206
00:13:01,982 --> 00:13:03,559
We searched everywhere,
inside the house,

207
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:05,585
outside the house,
the whole area.

208
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,363
- [Voiceover] I've already
dispatched a deputy

209
00:13:07,387 --> 00:13:08,621
to assist you.

210
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:10,233
Please remain at your
home until he arrives.

211
00:13:10,257 --> 00:13:11,458
- They'll be here soon?

212
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:13,236
- [Voiceover] Yes, sir,
they're on their way.

213
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,627
- Thank you. Thank
you very much.

214
00:13:20,033 --> 00:13:22,135
- You're a little close
to the phone lines.

215
00:13:22,169 --> 00:13:23,636
(Man whistles)

216
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,741
- Randy's boy Joey's gone
missing back at his place.

217
00:13:28,775 --> 00:13:30,077
I'm gonna head
home to help look.

218
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,511
- You want US to come with you?

219
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:34,081
- I appreciate it, but this
job has a tight deadline.

220
00:13:34,114 --> 00:13:36,749
- You sure? We can just start
extra early in the morning.

221
00:13:36,783 --> 00:13:38,661
- They'll probably find him
before I even get there.

222
00:13:38,685 --> 00:13:40,453
You boys better keep at it.

223
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:42,255
Sorry I have to
leave you like this.

224
00:13:42,289 --> 00:13:43,790
- [Man in middle]
Good luck, boss.

225
00:13:44,624 --> 00:13:46,264
You heard the man.
Let's get back to work.

226
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:01,508
- This is my wife, christal.

227
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:03,410
- Hi, I'm seargeant Bert Smith.

228
00:14:03,443 --> 00:14:04,644
- Hi.

229
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:05,445
- [Bert] I understand
your boy is missing.

230
00:14:05,478 --> 00:14:06,446
- That's right.

231
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:07,981
Where did you last see him?

232
00:14:08,015 --> 00:14:09,149
- I already told you...

233
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:10,750
- I need to hear
it from her, sir.

234
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:13,353
Do you mind if we
step over here?

235
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:21,028
- Sir, I apologize,
but what did you say

236
00:14:21,061 --> 00:14:22,462
your name was again?

237
00:14:22,495 --> 00:14:24,440
- Division chief benefield,
carroll county fire rescue,

238
00:14:24,464 --> 00:14:26,166
but you can call me bud.

239
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:28,535
- Okay, bud, why is he
questioning my wife like that?

240
00:14:28,568 --> 00:14:29,913
I already gave him
all the same info.

241
00:14:29,937 --> 00:14:31,238
- Nothing to worry about.

242
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:32,848
Just wanna maybe see if
she remembers anything

243
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,607
that you might have missed.

244
00:14:34,641 --> 00:14:37,010
- Mind if we have a look inside?

245
00:14:37,044 --> 00:14:38,511
- No, of course not.

246
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:52,392
- You've checked the
house thoroughly?

247
00:14:52,425 --> 00:14:53,560
- Several times.

248
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:54,995
- Was your son in trouble?

249
00:14:55,028 --> 00:14:56,906
Have you had an argument with
him or anything like that?

250
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:58,731
- No, no, he was
excited about the trip.

251
00:14:58,765 --> 00:15:00,243
- [Bud] There was no reason
for him to be afraid?

252
00:15:00,267 --> 00:15:01,477
He wasn't being
punished for anything?

253
00:15:01,501 --> 00:15:03,003
- No, sir, no.

254
00:15:04,004 --> 00:15:05,305
- [Bert] Excuse US a moment.

255
00:15:07,874 --> 00:15:09,009
- What are you thinking?

256
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:11,078
- Everything seems
to check out to me.

257
00:15:11,111 --> 00:15:12,612
Their stories match.

258
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:14,814
Nice home, well maintained,

259
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:17,317
Van loaded for vacation,
just like they said.

260
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,195
- And they're not frequent
flyers with your department

261
00:15:19,219 --> 00:15:20,420
or anything like that?

262
00:15:20,453 --> 00:15:22,922
- No, this is the first
time I ever been here.

263
00:15:22,956 --> 00:15:26,493
Fact is, I understand the
sheriff knows the family.

264
00:15:26,526 --> 00:15:28,061
- This is gonna be
a bear of a search.

265
00:15:28,095 --> 00:15:29,862
There's a lotta woods
and brush out here.

266
00:15:29,896 --> 00:15:31,965
This is gonna take
a lot of manpower.

267
00:15:31,999 --> 00:15:33,900
- Yeah, guess we
better get to it.

268
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,402
- Is something wrong?

269
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:36,970
Are we suspects or something?

270
00:15:37,004 --> 00:15:38,405
- No, ma'am, not at all.

271
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:40,583
We just have to be certain
that before we call the cavalry

272
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:43,476
that we understand
the situation.

273
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:45,812
- You mean, if we're
telling the truth.

274
00:15:45,845 --> 00:15:48,281
- Not every call we get
is what it appears to be,

275
00:15:48,315 --> 00:15:50,050
especially when
children are involved.

276
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:51,985
I hope you understand.

277
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:53,886
- Yeah, we do understand.

278
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,390
- Have you seen any unusual
vehicles in the area lately,

279
00:15:57,424 --> 00:15:58,925
or any strangers?

280
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,261
- You don't think somebody
grabbed him, do you?

281
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:04,097
- I doubt it. You're pretty
isolated out here and all.

282
00:16:04,131 --> 00:16:07,100
It'd be hard for someone
to do it and not be seen,

283
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:08,801
but it has happened.

284
00:16:08,835 --> 00:16:11,238
Anyone you know holding
a grudge against you,

285
00:16:11,271 --> 00:16:13,873
a disgruntled employee
or a family member?

286
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:16,109
- No, no, none that
I can think of.

287
00:16:16,143 --> 00:16:17,044
- Seargeant Smith
and I are gonna

288
00:16:17,077 --> 00:16:18,154
step outside and make some calls

289
00:16:18,178 --> 00:16:20,247
for additional
manpower and resources.

290
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,025
Once they're on their
way, I'll need to go over

291
00:16:22,049 --> 00:16:23,683
more details with
the two of you.

292
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:25,094
- If you have a recent
photo of your son,

293
00:16:25,118 --> 00:16:26,219
it'd be a big help.

294
00:16:26,253 --> 00:16:27,687
- Yeah, sure.

295
00:16:28,621 --> 00:16:30,133
- [Bud] I'd like the two
of you to show me on a map

296
00:16:30,157 --> 00:16:32,859
where you've looked and where
you think he might have gone.

297
00:16:34,194 --> 00:16:35,928
And don't worry too much.

298
00:16:35,962 --> 00:16:37,864
He'll probably come
wandering up any minute,

299
00:16:37,897 --> 00:16:39,332
but if he doesn't,

300
00:16:39,366 --> 00:16:40,809
we'll have a lotta people here
looking for him real soon.

301
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:41,901
- Thank you.

302
00:16:47,574 --> 00:16:50,043
(Phone rings)

303
00:16:50,077 --> 00:16:51,311
- Helo.

304
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:54,281
- Hello, pastor Jerry,
this is Mary simpkins.

305
00:16:54,314 --> 00:16:56,149
- Mary, what can I do for you?

306
00:16:56,183 --> 00:16:59,886
- [Mary] My grandson Joe,
Randy and christal's baby boy,

307
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:00,920
has disappeared.

308
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:03,323
We're looking all over for him.

309
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:05,024
The police are here
and everything.

310
00:17:05,058 --> 00:17:07,127
- Oh my goodness,
Mary, you don't think

311
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,329
that someone took
off with him, do you?

312
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:11,398
- I don't know.

313
00:17:11,431 --> 00:17:13,266
I think he just wandered off.

314
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,302
There's so many lakes
and ponds around here,

315
00:17:15,335 --> 00:17:17,237
and lots of woods.

316
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:20,240
He's never just walked
off like this before.

317
00:17:20,273 --> 00:17:22,642
- I understand. It's okay, Mary.

318
00:17:23,476 --> 00:17:26,446
- I was hoping that we might
get a prayer chain started.

319
00:17:26,479 --> 00:17:28,448
- I think that would
be a good idea.

320
00:17:28,481 --> 00:17:32,719
- I'm making some calls
but there's a lotta names.

321
00:17:32,752 --> 00:17:34,887
- I'll get some help.

322
00:17:34,921 --> 00:17:36,623
Do they need anyone
to help search?

323
00:17:36,656 --> 00:17:38,225
- I think so.

324
00:17:38,258 --> 00:17:40,460
- [Jerry] We'll get
some volunteers, too.

325
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:42,429
- Thank you.

326
00:17:42,462 --> 00:17:44,364
- Mary, it's gonna be okay.

327
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:45,932
God will be right here,

328
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:48,435
and remember, he's
with Joe, too.

329
00:17:50,637 --> 00:17:52,877
- [Voiceover] All members
should bring atvs if available.

330
00:17:53,973 --> 00:17:55,575
Dispatch is clear, 803.

331
00:17:55,608 --> 00:17:57,477
803 is gold dust command.

332
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:01,314
Randy, hang on.

333
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:04,617
I need you over
here for a minute.

334
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,688
- Yeah.

335
00:18:09,522 --> 00:18:11,758
- I need you to stay
here for right now.

336
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:13,960
- Why? I'm just standing around.

337
00:18:13,993 --> 00:18:15,595
I should be out
looking for my son.

338
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:17,964
- I understand, but we have a
lot of professional searchers

339
00:18:17,997 --> 00:18:19,708
headed our way and we
gotta have a game plan

340
00:18:19,732 --> 00:18:21,134
when they get here.

341
00:18:21,168 --> 00:18:22,911
Plus, I need you here to
help me paint a picture

342
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,647
of this area so we can
get them in the field

343
00:18:24,671 --> 00:18:26,072
as quickly as possible.

344
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,016
- Okay, I could have been
doing that the last 15 minutes.

345
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,952
- If you had, then they wouldn't
be on their way right now,

346
00:18:29,976 --> 00:18:31,820
plus I had to call the state
emergency management office

347
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:33,389
to request the resources
that are gonna take

348
00:18:33,413 --> 00:18:35,782
the longest to get,
like a helicopter,

349
00:18:35,815 --> 00:18:37,726
so we can have it here
when it'll do US some good.

350
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,051
- [Bert] How's it going?

351
00:18:39,085 --> 00:18:40,987
- Dnr says they
can have one in 45,

352
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:43,323
but their chopper's
not flir-equipped.

353
00:18:43,356 --> 00:18:44,824
Our state patrol
friend over there

354
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:46,469
says he's got one
that's flir-equipped...

355
00:18:46,493 --> 00:18:47,394
- flir?

356
00:18:47,427 --> 00:18:48,504
- But it doesn't have an eta.

357
00:18:48,528 --> 00:18:49,629
- What...

358
00:18:49,662 --> 00:18:51,598
- it's a forward-looking
infrared camera.

359
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:54,901
It can detect objects like a
heated body through the trees.

360
00:18:54,934 --> 00:18:57,637
- That's not gonna be much
good on a hot day like this.

361
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:59,806
- Maybe not but if we get
into the night, it will,

362
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:01,308
plus with all the
foliage out here,

363
00:19:01,341 --> 00:19:02,775
it's gonna be hard for a chopper

364
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:04,411
to have any kind
of vision anyway.

365
00:19:04,444 --> 00:19:06,078
It's better than not having one.

366
00:19:06,112 --> 00:19:08,114
- Bud, the chopper will
be all set in an hour.

367
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,081
Tell 'em to head this way.

368
00:19:09,115 --> 00:19:10,016
- Okay.

369
00:19:10,049 --> 00:19:11,484
- What about the canine unit?

370
00:19:11,518 --> 00:19:14,787
- They're working on drug
interdiction up in meriwether.

371
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:16,623
Eta is about an hour.

372
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:17,790
- We can't wait that long

373
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:19,392
to get the search
teams in the field.

374
00:19:19,426 --> 00:19:21,694
- What's the problem?

375
00:19:21,728 --> 00:19:24,697
- Normally, you want the dogs
to get into the field first.

376
00:19:24,731 --> 00:19:26,165
Once the search
teams get out there,

377
00:19:26,199 --> 00:19:28,535
they can confuse the scent.

378
00:19:29,602 --> 00:19:30,737
It's better late than never.

379
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:32,439
Let's just get 'em
here, all right?

380
00:19:32,472 --> 00:19:34,441
Randy, show me
where you've looked,

381
00:19:34,474 --> 00:19:36,276
and what neighbors
you checked with.

382
00:19:38,978 --> 00:19:40,547
- Is there a
helicopter there yet?

383
00:19:41,348 --> 00:19:42,791
You can never tell with
these state agencies

384
00:19:42,815 --> 00:19:45,385
how long it will take to
get one there, if at all.

385
00:19:48,655 --> 00:19:50,535
Tell christal I'll be
there as soon as possible.

386
00:19:54,294 --> 00:19:55,595
Thanks, dear.

387
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,269
- Is everything okay?

388
00:20:05,605 --> 00:20:06,982
- The two-year-old
son of my dear friends

389
00:20:07,006 --> 00:20:09,175
Randy and christal
simpkins has disappeared.

390
00:20:10,577 --> 00:20:12,111
- God, that's awful.

391
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:14,985
- It's going to be very
difficult terrain to search.

392
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:18,117
A helicopter's
their best chance.

393
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:18,985
- Do you think the
Atlanta news stations

394
00:20:19,018 --> 00:20:20,253
will send one of theirs?

395
00:20:20,287 --> 00:20:21,597
- They won't unless
they assign a reporter

396
00:20:21,621 --> 00:20:23,122
to cover the story.

397
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:24,891
That would be the hard part,

398
00:20:24,924 --> 00:20:27,327
to convince them that this is
a story they need to cover.

399
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,497
We're just too far outside
Atlanta to get much attention.

400
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:32,865
- Okay, do you still have
your contacts at channel six?

401
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:35,335
I know you did a presidential
debate analysis for them once.

402
00:20:35,368 --> 00:20:39,105
- Yes, yes, I'm sure I can
get one of the producers

403
00:20:39,138 --> 00:20:40,573
on the phone.

404
00:20:40,607 --> 00:20:42,217
- Okay, we have interns at
all the network affiliates.

405
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,086
I can call one of them and see
if they can put me in touch

406
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,945
with their story
assignment editor.

407
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:47,179
- Bless you, Teresa.

408
00:20:47,213 --> 00:20:48,491
If you get a reporter
on the phone,

409
00:20:48,515 --> 00:20:50,883
transfer it to my office.

410
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:52,060
And don't take no for an answer.

411
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,386
- [Teresa] Don't worry, I won't.

412
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,090
- Okay.

413
00:21:00,293 --> 00:21:02,228
Okay, I'm on my way over.

414
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,630
Thank you, Mary.

415
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,011
- Christal simpkins' little
one has gone missing.

416
00:21:09,035 --> 00:21:10,570
There's a search
on at their place.

417
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:11,538
I'm going over to help.

418
00:21:11,571 --> 00:21:13,340
- I wanna go, too.

419
00:21:13,373 --> 00:21:15,274
- Okay, lock the doors.

420
00:21:15,308 --> 00:21:16,643
Were closing up.

421
00:21:22,349 --> 00:21:24,317
- I think you're the
third person to do that.

422
00:21:24,351 --> 00:21:25,652
I was the first.

423
00:21:25,685 --> 00:21:26,986
- Better safe than sorry.

424
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,456
Does Joe like to hide?

425
00:21:29,489 --> 00:21:31,257
- No, not unless he's
playing hide and seek

426
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,225
with his brothers,
and they weren't here.

427
00:21:34,327 --> 00:21:37,229
- Any little hideaway places
he likes to take naps?

428
00:21:38,264 --> 00:21:41,468
- Huh uh, and I checked
'em all several times.

429
00:21:43,002 --> 00:21:45,271
I've already answered
all these questions.

430
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,207
Everybody's asking
me the same things

431
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,409
over and over again.

432
00:21:49,442 --> 00:21:50,343
I don't understand
why you all don't just

433
00:21:50,377 --> 00:21:52,512
get out there and find my son.

434
00:21:52,545 --> 00:21:54,981
- I understand your
frustration, Mrs. Simpkins.

435
00:21:55,014 --> 00:21:57,850
Right now, the more
information we get, the better.

436
00:21:57,884 --> 00:22:00,052
Maybe you'll think
of something new

437
00:22:00,086 --> 00:22:02,389
after being asked
a hundred times.

438
00:22:02,422 --> 00:22:04,591
Maybe I'll hear something
the other deputies didn't.

439
00:22:18,137 --> 00:22:20,272
Sheriff Reeves, these
are the parents.

440
00:22:20,306 --> 00:22:22,775
- There's no need, deputy,
our families go way back.

441
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:24,911
Randy, christal.

442
00:22:25,645 --> 00:22:26,789
Guess you all figured my people

443
00:22:26,813 --> 00:22:28,515
needed something
to do today, huh?

444
00:22:28,548 --> 00:22:29,982
- I didn't.

445
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:31,117
I guess my son did.

446
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:32,819
- It's Joe that's missing?

447
00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:34,320
- That's right.

448
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,923
- Okay, I'm gonna head on
over, check what the plan is,

449
00:22:36,956 --> 00:22:39,158
and I'll come back and
let you know what's what.

450
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,660
- Thanks, Tony.

451
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:43,105
- We'll find him for you,
christal. Don't you worry.

452
00:22:43,129 --> 00:22:44,263
- Thank you.

453
00:22:44,831 --> 00:22:46,265
- Deputy.

454
00:22:52,805 --> 00:22:54,941
- How embarrassing, our
Christmas lights are still up.

455
00:22:56,142 --> 00:22:57,820
- That's what you're
worried about right now?

456
00:22:57,844 --> 00:23:00,179
- No, that's not what i'm
worried about right now!

457
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:01,914
What I'm worried
about is our son,

458
00:23:01,948 --> 00:23:04,316
who would be here right now
if you'd done what I asked.

459
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:05,652
- What are you talking about?

460
00:23:05,685 --> 00:23:07,219
- I told you to
put him in the Van,

461
00:23:07,253 --> 00:23:09,355
but you don't ever
do anything I say,

462
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:10,633
like taking down the
Christmas lights!

463
00:23:10,657 --> 00:23:11,791
- I'm sorry, okay!

464
00:23:11,824 --> 00:23:13,225
Somebody has to
work around here.

465
00:23:13,259 --> 00:23:15,394
- Don't even start!

466
00:23:15,428 --> 00:23:16,796
That's just your
excuse to get away

467
00:23:16,829 --> 00:23:18,698
from the really hard
work around here.

468
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:20,833
- You think I don't work hard?

469
00:23:20,867 --> 00:23:22,735
That's all I ever do,

470
00:23:22,769 --> 00:23:24,571
so I can put food on the table,

471
00:23:24,604 --> 00:23:26,105
clothes on our kids,

472
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:27,907
and a roof over our head.

473
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,576
- I know you work hard,

474
00:23:29,609 --> 00:23:31,010
just not at what really matters.

475
00:23:31,043 --> 00:23:33,245
- Providing for my family
is not what really matters?

476
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,858
- Do you think your
boys are gonna thank you

477
00:23:35,882 --> 00:23:37,984
when they grow up for
all the work you did?

478
00:23:44,557 --> 00:23:46,025
- I'm gonna go find our son.

479
00:24:04,343 --> 00:24:05,377
Hi.

480
00:24:14,854 --> 00:24:17,123
Yeah, can you give me a smile?

481
00:24:21,761 --> 00:24:24,296
- Okay, let's go
through it again.

482
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:27,033
Is there any way that he
might have, I don't know,

483
00:24:27,066 --> 00:24:29,001
gone to visit some neighbor?

484
00:24:38,044 --> 00:24:40,146
- Ma'am, I'm sorry,
can I help you?

485
00:24:40,179 --> 00:24:41,548
- I'm a friend of the family.

486
00:24:41,581 --> 00:24:42,882
- [Officer] What's your name?

487
00:24:42,915 --> 00:24:43,850
- I'm Carol fulton.

488
00:24:43,883 --> 00:24:45,552
- Okay, hang on just one second.

489
00:24:45,585 --> 00:24:46,986
Let me get them through.

490
00:24:48,254 --> 00:24:49,789
Follow them up when they go by.

491
00:24:52,592 --> 00:24:53,993
Guys, can I help you?

492
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:06,338
- [Bud] Pop that trunk.
Let's get this thing opened.

493
00:25:11,878 --> 00:25:13,613
- Hey, there, Tony.

494
00:25:13,646 --> 00:25:14,914
- Gary.

495
00:25:14,947 --> 00:25:16,148
- Where we at?

496
00:25:16,182 --> 00:25:17,526
- I'm ready to get
these boys in the field

497
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:18,918
and find that kid.

498
00:25:18,951 --> 00:25:20,152
- Let's do it.

499
00:25:28,127 --> 00:25:29,829
- [Carol] Oh, lord,
christal, come here.

500
00:25:32,264 --> 00:25:33,265
- I'm such a failure.

501
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:34,667
- No, you're not.

502
00:25:38,004 --> 00:25:39,371
- I lost my son.

503
00:25:39,405 --> 00:25:41,507
What kind of mother
loses her son?

504
00:25:42,308 --> 00:25:43,542
- It's not your fault.

505
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:46,378
Children wander
off all the time.

506
00:25:46,412 --> 00:25:48,514
Mine have several times.

507
00:25:48,948 --> 00:25:50,416
- I can't find him, Carol.

508
00:25:51,117 --> 00:25:52,318
He's just vanished.

509
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:55,287
What if I never see him again?

510
00:25:56,155 --> 00:25:57,890
I just don't think
I can do this.

511
00:25:57,924 --> 00:25:59,325
- Yes, you can,

512
00:26:00,192 --> 00:26:02,629
because god is
right here with you,

513
00:26:02,662 --> 00:26:04,831
and he is out there
watching over little Joe,

514
00:26:05,231 --> 00:26:07,533
and he is going to bring
him back home safe to you.

515
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,401
- Do you think so?

516
00:26:09,435 --> 00:26:10,937
- Yes, I do,

517
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:12,605
if we ask for his help.

518
00:26:13,505 --> 00:26:14,707
Let's do that right now.

519
00:26:14,741 --> 00:26:16,142
- Okay.

520
00:26:16,175 --> 00:26:19,478
- Dear lord, please be with
little Joe wherever he is.

521
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:23,716
Please be with these brave
men who have come to help,

522
00:26:24,717 --> 00:26:27,053
and please be with christal
and Randy right now,

523
00:26:27,687 --> 00:26:29,656
and bring them
comfort and strength.

524
00:26:30,389 --> 00:26:32,659
We ask this in your name, amen.

525
00:26:33,159 --> 00:26:34,193
- Amen.

526
00:26:35,227 --> 00:26:36,462
Thank you.

527
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:38,698
You're right.

528
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,501
He's here with US and with Joe.

529
00:26:42,534 --> 00:26:43,736
- Of course he is.

530
00:26:44,804 --> 00:26:46,238
- Thank you, Carol.

531
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,387
- [Bud] Gather around, everyone.

532
00:26:52,411 --> 00:26:53,512
Come on in.

533
00:26:55,581 --> 00:26:56,783
- Listen up.

534
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:59,161
We're ready to
divide you into teams

535
00:26:59,185 --> 00:27:00,586
and get you into the field.

536
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,564
The description of the
boy you're searching for,

537
00:27:02,588 --> 00:27:04,724
Joseph simpkins, is posted here,

538
00:27:04,757 --> 00:27:06,726
at the command post, along
with a current photo.

539
00:27:07,426 --> 00:27:10,963
We have divided the
search area into sections.

540
00:27:10,997 --> 00:27:14,934
Each team will be responsible
for an assigned section.

541
00:27:15,802 --> 00:27:17,303
Team leaders will
check back here

542
00:27:17,336 --> 00:27:19,571
every 20 minutes with par.

543
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:22,508
There's several lakes
and ponds out there,

544
00:27:22,541 --> 00:27:25,778
and there's a manure pit here.

545
00:27:26,879 --> 00:27:29,615
Looks for any signs of disturbance,
footprints and such,

546
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:33,152
along the perimeter of any
and every body of water

547
00:27:33,185 --> 00:27:34,887
no matter how small.

548
00:27:34,921 --> 00:27:36,022
Got that?

549
00:27:37,223 --> 00:27:38,357
Tony.

550
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:40,126
- Most of you all
know each other.

551
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:41,503
You know that our two
departments have always

552
00:27:41,527 --> 00:27:45,464
worked well together but
today, we're one department.

553
00:27:46,132 --> 00:27:47,132
You got me?

554
00:27:48,935 --> 00:27:50,669
That said,

555
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:54,606
it's possible we could find a
crime scene out there today.

556
00:27:55,574 --> 00:27:57,977
I hope to god that doesn't
happen but if it does,

557
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:00,412
the first thing I want
you to do is make certain

558
00:28:00,446 --> 00:28:02,281
that the boy is, in fact, dead.

559
00:28:03,449 --> 00:28:05,084
Back away from the scene,

560
00:28:05,117 --> 00:28:06,552
cordon off the area,

561
00:28:06,585 --> 00:28:08,888
and report in to US
using police code only.

562
00:28:09,956 --> 00:28:11,791
Fire rescue is gonna
relinquish the scene,

563
00:28:11,824 --> 00:28:12,792
and the sheriff's department

564
00:28:12,825 --> 00:28:14,293
and the state patrol takes over.

565
00:28:14,326 --> 00:28:15,561
Any questions?

566
00:28:15,962 --> 00:28:17,396
- No, sir.

567
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:19,565
- Bud's gonna give you your
assignments. Good luck.

568
00:28:20,833 --> 00:28:22,273
- Okay, guys, the
sheriff already has

569
00:28:22,301 --> 00:28:24,661
a perimeter established with
some of his deputies out there.

570
00:28:25,171 --> 00:28:26,172
- Joe!

571
00:28:32,411 --> 00:28:33,980
Joseph, can you hear me?

572
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:36,682
Joe!

573
00:28:46,859 --> 00:28:48,027
Joe!

574
00:29:06,345 --> 00:29:07,546
Joe!

575
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:10,749
- Do they need help?

576
00:29:10,783 --> 00:29:12,251
- I think... (car horn honks)

577
00:29:12,284 --> 00:29:13,319
Oh, it's my husband.

578
00:29:13,352 --> 00:29:14,352
Excuse me.

579
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:24,596
- Mary, he's still missing.

580
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:25,932
- I was headed down to the pits

581
00:29:25,965 --> 00:29:27,834
where we dumped the lake debris,

582
00:29:27,867 --> 00:29:29,101
and they're filled with water.

583
00:29:29,135 --> 00:29:30,512
- I've been meaning to
fill those things in.

584
00:29:30,536 --> 00:29:32,271
I just haven't had the time.

585
00:29:32,304 --> 00:29:33,806
- I've been making some calls.

586
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,975
Lots of people have been
coming by to help search,

587
00:29:36,008 --> 00:29:39,378
plus the sheriff's over
at Randy and christal's.

588
00:29:39,411 --> 00:29:41,447
- I'm gonna have a look around.

589
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:44,450
If you see anything
suspicious in those pits,

590
00:29:44,483 --> 00:29:45,751
I'll get the pump.

591
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,524
- We figured if you were
gonna take the day off,

592
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:18,150
we would, too.

593
00:30:18,184 --> 00:30:21,120
- I appreciate that,
boys, I truly do.

594
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:22,354
- How can we help?

595
00:30:22,388 --> 00:30:24,623
- Just spread out
and start looking.

596
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,736
- Don't worry, we're gonna
find him, all right, boss?

597
00:30:31,898 --> 00:30:33,866
- Okay, team three, I
want you to head east

598
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,601
on gold dust trail, all right?

599
00:30:35,634 --> 00:30:38,737
I want you to clear every
house up to this point here.

600
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:42,241
Check crawl spaces,
storage sheds, everything.

601
00:30:42,274 --> 00:30:44,143
Let me know when the
area's been cleared.

602
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:45,511
- Let's go.

603
00:30:48,547 --> 00:30:50,983
- Chief, chopper's onsite.

604
00:30:59,025 --> 00:31:00,526
- This is deputy
director baskins.

605
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:03,029
We are onsite requesting
where you would like US

606
00:31:03,062 --> 00:31:04,163
to begin the search.

607
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:10,236
- Stand by.

608
00:31:10,269 --> 00:31:11,637
- Have 'em go a one-mile radius

609
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:13,048
and survey for any
areas of interest

610
00:31:13,072 --> 00:31:15,272
that might warrant investigation
by a ground crew, okay?

611
00:31:15,908 --> 00:31:17,052
- The k9 team's
arrived but they say

612
00:31:17,076 --> 00:31:19,011
with everybody out
here, they can't deploy.

613
00:31:19,045 --> 00:31:20,279
I told 'em to stand by.

614
00:31:20,312 --> 00:31:22,381
We'll just let 'em know
if we find a fresh place

615
00:31:22,414 --> 00:31:23,591
to search that
hasn't been trampled.

616
00:31:23,615 --> 00:31:25,584
- [Bert] Whoa! You
better listen to me.

617
00:31:26,552 --> 00:31:27,486
- Listen, mister...

618
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:28,787
- [Bert] Seargant Bert Smith.

619
00:31:29,055 --> 00:31:30,056
- Yeah, whatever.

620
00:31:30,089 --> 00:31:31,623
Look, I'm Randy's cousin.

621
00:31:31,657 --> 00:31:33,993
His mom called me to
help look for little Joe,

622
00:31:34,026 --> 00:31:35,427
and that is what I'm gonna do.

623
00:31:35,461 --> 00:31:37,896
- I done told you, only
search and rescue personnel

624
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:39,698
are allowed in the fields.

625
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:42,534
- I don't see that many
of 'em out there, frankly.

626
00:31:42,568 --> 00:31:44,212
- It seems to me that if you
really wanna find the boy,

627
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:46,272
you'd accept any help you could.

628
00:31:46,305 --> 00:31:48,083
- How do I know you're
related to the family, huh,

629
00:31:48,107 --> 00:31:51,410
that you just won't go out
there and make matters worse,

630
00:31:51,443 --> 00:31:54,046
like get lost, or hurt,
or trample over clues,

631
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,247
or who knows what else?

632
00:31:56,015 --> 00:31:58,650
The fact is I got
my orders, sir,

633
00:31:58,684 --> 00:32:00,519
and you ain't going anywhere

634
00:32:00,552 --> 00:32:03,289
except right back
down that driveway.

635
00:32:03,322 --> 00:32:05,791
- What I'm gonna do is
go through that gate,

636
00:32:05,824 --> 00:32:07,693
and if you don't like
it, you can shoot me.

637
00:32:07,726 --> 00:32:09,261
- [Voiceover] Deputy Smith.

638
00:32:09,295 --> 00:32:10,829
Over here.

639
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:12,631
- The sheriff wants
a word with me.

640
00:32:13,132 --> 00:32:15,701
I'll tell him how you feel
and I'll see what I can do,

641
00:32:15,734 --> 00:32:18,437
but you've got to agree you
just gonna stay right here

642
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:20,239
while I do, okay?

643
00:32:24,977 --> 00:32:26,112
- What's going on, Bert?

644
00:32:26,145 --> 00:32:28,147
- Sir, we got a little
trouble brewing.

645
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:30,416
We getting flooded with
folks that I don't even know

646
00:32:30,449 --> 00:32:32,084
who want to jump in and search.

647
00:32:32,118 --> 00:32:35,287
I told him polite, but he
ain't taking no for an answer.

648
00:32:35,321 --> 00:32:37,523
We already got some of 'em
out there on their own.

649
00:32:37,556 --> 00:32:39,034
- I just got a report
that there's folks parking

650
00:32:39,058 --> 00:32:41,327
over at the sweetgrass farm
and searching on their own.

651
00:32:42,494 --> 00:32:44,296
- This could get
outta hand real quick.

652
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:45,640
- [Tony] The problem
is we don't know

653
00:32:45,664 --> 00:32:47,566
who half them folks are
and every now and then,

654
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:48,876
you get some wacko
showing up and offering

655
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,369
to search for a missing kid

656
00:32:50,402 --> 00:32:52,171
that doesn't have the
purest of intentions.

657
00:32:52,204 --> 00:32:53,348
- Well, if we
don't let 'em help,

658
00:32:53,372 --> 00:32:55,141
things could get real ugly.

659
00:32:55,174 --> 00:32:57,309
We could spend just as
much time on manpower

660
00:32:57,343 --> 00:32:58,977
trying to get 'em
to stop searching.

661
00:32:59,011 --> 00:33:00,155
- Then Randy and
Chris are gonna wonder

662
00:33:00,179 --> 00:33:02,314
why we're turning away help.

663
00:33:02,348 --> 00:33:05,117
- Well, it is their child.

664
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:07,486
I say we express
our concerns to them

665
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:08,987
and see what they think.

666
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:55,210
- My mother-in-law has been
on the phone with her church

667
00:33:55,234 --> 00:33:57,203
and everyone else she knows.

668
00:33:57,236 --> 00:33:59,037
Believe me, that's
a lot of people.

669
00:33:59,738 --> 00:34:01,173
- It looks like
they all showed up.

670
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:04,110
- What do you want US
to do, Mrs. Simpkins?

671
00:34:06,112 --> 00:34:07,992
- I think they're the
answer to a lotta prayers.

672
00:34:10,582 --> 00:34:13,385
- All right, have your men
bring 'em to the command post.

673
00:34:13,419 --> 00:34:15,530
We'll start a sign-up sheet
for those who wannna search.

674
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:16,664
We'll integrate
'em with our men.

675
00:34:16,688 --> 00:34:18,590
That way we can
keep an eye on 'em.

676
00:34:18,624 --> 00:34:19,825
- Deputy.

677
00:34:20,259 --> 00:34:21,403
Send somebody over to that farm

678
00:34:21,427 --> 00:34:22,537
and round up
everybody over there

679
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:24,062
who's searching on their own.

680
00:34:24,096 --> 00:34:25,240
Tell 'em if they
wanna search with US,

681
00:34:25,264 --> 00:34:27,133
they gotta sign in here first.

682
00:34:27,166 --> 00:34:28,334
- Yes, sir.

683
00:34:29,501 --> 00:34:30,502
- Thank you.

684
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:48,954
- Joe!

685
00:34:53,192 --> 00:34:55,827
(Joe giggles)

686
00:35:00,799 --> 00:35:02,999
- Let's see if we can hit the
top of the grain elevator.

687
00:35:03,802 --> 00:35:04,603
Yeah, you can, Joe. Go ahead.

688
00:35:04,636 --> 00:35:05,671
- [Joe] I can't.

689
00:35:09,808 --> 00:35:10,942
- Pretty good. (Phone rings)

690
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:13,212
- Shoot, that was
nothing, watch this.

691
00:35:16,382 --> 00:35:17,283
- This is Randy.

692
00:35:17,316 --> 00:35:19,351
- [Voiceover] Randy, (mumbles).

693
00:35:19,385 --> 00:35:21,553
- No, that bid went in Thursday.

694
00:35:22,354 --> 00:35:24,490
Well, I know for a fact
because I delivered it myself.

695
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:26,358
- Daddy, watch!

696
00:35:26,392 --> 00:35:27,535
- Joe, Joe, stop it,
okay, I'm on the phone.

697
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:29,395
- [Voiceover] What
are we gonna do?

698
00:35:29,428 --> 00:35:30,396
- All right, you know what,

699
00:35:30,429 --> 00:35:32,298
I've got a copy in the office.

700
00:35:32,331 --> 00:35:34,566
Give me a few minutes and
I'll fax it over to you.

701
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,901
Thanks for letting me know.

702
00:35:35,934 --> 00:35:37,703
You're a lifesaver.

703
00:35:37,736 --> 00:35:38,937
Sorry, guys.

704
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,770
Joe, I'll come back and
watch you in a minute.

705
00:35:43,275 --> 00:35:44,510
- Let's go home.

706
00:35:56,555 --> 00:35:57,556
Joe!

707
00:36:03,362 --> 00:36:04,362
Joe!

708
00:36:23,382 --> 00:36:24,616
Joey!

709
00:36:28,086 --> 00:36:29,154
Joe!

710
00:36:33,825 --> 00:36:34,825
Joe!

711
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:36,694
- [Voiceover] Joe!

712
00:36:37,563 --> 00:36:38,563
- [Voiceover] Joe!

713
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:40,130
- [Voiceover] Joe!

714
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:43,869
- [Voiceover] Joe!

715
00:36:43,902 --> 00:36:44,902
- [Voiceover] Joe!

716
00:36:46,071 --> 00:36:47,071
- [Voiceover] Joe!

717
00:36:49,808 --> 00:36:50,808
- [Voiceover] Joe!

718
00:36:51,443 --> 00:36:52,311
- [Voiceover] Joey!

719
00:36:52,344 --> 00:36:53,579
- [Voiceover] Joe!

720
00:36:54,413 --> 00:36:55,823
- Sir, if you'd like to
help with the search,

721
00:36:55,847 --> 00:36:57,807
I'm gonna need you to sign
in at the command post.

722
00:36:58,183 --> 00:36:59,585
- This is Joe's dad.

723
00:36:59,618 --> 00:37:00,819
You okay, Randy?

724
00:37:01,453 --> 00:37:02,453
- Yeah.

725
00:37:02,888 --> 00:37:04,490
- I'm sorry, I didn't know.

726
00:37:04,523 --> 00:37:05,924
- No problem.

727
00:37:06,458 --> 00:37:10,396
I'm just, uh, I'm very
thankful that you're all here.

728
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:12,698
- You're welcome to join US.

729
00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:15,100
- No, no, sir, I'm gonna
head back to the house.

730
00:37:15,601 --> 00:37:16,735
- If you're sure.

731
00:37:16,768 --> 00:37:18,737
Let's continue our grid search.

732
00:37:21,273 --> 00:37:22,341
- It'll be okay, Randy.

733
00:37:22,374 --> 00:37:24,443
We're here for you, and for Joe.

734
00:37:33,752 --> 00:37:34,752
- [Rrandy] Joe!

735
00:37:40,659 --> 00:37:41,727
Joe!

736
00:37:52,404 --> 00:37:53,404
Joe!

737
00:38:00,211 --> 00:38:01,246
Joe!

738
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:05,616
Joe!

739
00:38:09,755 --> 00:38:10,756
Joe!

740
00:38:12,391 --> 00:38:13,391
Joe!

741
00:38:24,002 --> 00:38:25,070
Joe!

742
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:27,673
Joe!

743
00:38:35,046 --> 00:38:36,046
Joe!

744
00:38:43,021 --> 00:38:44,021
Joe!

745
00:38:47,393 --> 00:38:48,394
Joe!

746
00:38:52,698 --> 00:38:53,698
Joe!

747
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:03,475
(Randy cries)

748
00:39:04,476 --> 00:39:05,611
- Please.

749
00:39:08,714 --> 00:39:13,151
(Randy cries)

750
00:39:17,889 --> 00:39:19,057
- Joe.

751
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:23,495
(Randy cries)

752
00:39:27,766 --> 00:39:29,601
- Please, god,
don't take my son.

753
00:39:30,669 --> 00:39:32,638
Please, don't take my son.

754
00:39:33,439 --> 00:39:37,308
(Randy cries)

755
00:39:39,745 --> 00:39:41,513
- I know I haven't been there.

756
00:39:42,814 --> 00:39:45,484
I know I haven't spent
enough time with him.

757
00:39:47,586 --> 00:39:50,121
Please give me another
chance to be there.

758
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:53,358
All right, Joe! (Laughs)

759
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:05,103
- [Randy] Joe simpkins
draws back! He throws!

760
00:40:05,136 --> 00:40:06,738
Touchdown!

761
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,585
- [Voiceover] Number seven,
Joe simpkins breaks open

762
00:40:10,609 --> 00:40:13,044
for a huge first
down! (Crowd cheers)

763
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:16,715
- I now pronounce
you man and wife.

764
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:18,283
You may kiss the bride.

765
00:40:24,956 --> 00:40:26,324
- Here's your grandson.

766
00:40:30,962 --> 00:40:34,533
- Oh, ho, ho. (Laughs)

767
00:40:36,401 --> 00:40:37,569
(Loud bang)

768
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:07,833
- Please, god,

769
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:12,804
if Joe's alive,

770
00:41:14,573 --> 00:41:15,674
just let me know.

771
00:41:16,341 --> 00:41:18,376
Give me some kind of a sign

772
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:19,878
that my son is not dead.

773
00:41:52,544 --> 00:41:53,544
- Terry.

774
00:41:53,812 --> 00:41:54,813
- Thank you, momma.

775
00:41:55,547 --> 00:41:56,982
Find everything okay?

776
00:41:57,015 --> 00:41:59,484
- Yes, but I heard the worst
thing while I was gone.

777
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:01,119
Little Joe is missing.

778
00:42:02,988 --> 00:42:04,389
What was that, momma?

779
00:42:04,422 --> 00:42:06,457
- The youngest simpkins
boy is missing.

780
00:42:06,491 --> 00:42:08,860
They must have half the county
over there looking for him.

781
00:42:09,394 --> 00:42:11,062
- What was that about Joe?

782
00:42:11,096 --> 00:42:13,531
That's the boy's
name, Joe simpkins.

783
00:42:16,968 --> 00:42:19,905
- Well, I guess we better
get over there and find him.

784
00:42:20,205 --> 00:42:21,339
- You sure, daddy?

785
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:23,012
You just had heart
surgery two months ago.

786
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:24,843
- I'm well enough.

787
00:42:24,876 --> 00:42:26,511
- [Terry] All right, let's go.

788
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:28,346
- Ed, I know you
wanna help, I do, too,

789
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:30,248
but they've got plenty
over there, believe me,

790
00:42:30,281 --> 00:42:32,884
the sheriff, fire, state patrol.

791
00:42:32,918 --> 00:42:34,586
They could use a couple more.

792
00:42:35,621 --> 00:42:36,521
- [Momma] Make that three.

793
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:38,023
- [Ed] All right.

794
00:42:43,629 --> 00:42:47,298
- Christal, hi, I'm joy, from
the church in whitesburg.

795
00:42:47,332 --> 00:42:49,100
We've come to help
find your boy.

796
00:42:49,134 --> 00:42:50,468
- How did you even know?

797
00:42:50,501 --> 00:42:52,170
- Your preacher
called our preacher,

798
00:42:52,203 --> 00:42:55,073
and we decided to get a
group up and come on over.

799
00:42:55,841 --> 00:42:56,775
- Thank you.

800
00:42:56,808 --> 00:42:57,876
- [Joy] What can we do?

801
00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:00,211
- Excuse me.

802
00:43:01,747 --> 00:43:02,814
- Momma!

803
00:43:06,551 --> 00:43:07,518
- You didn't have to.

804
00:43:07,552 --> 00:43:10,121
- It was no problem at all.

805
00:43:10,155 --> 00:43:12,123
Believe it or not, they
closed school early.

806
00:43:12,157 --> 00:43:13,735
When principal Ballard
found out about Joe,

807
00:43:13,759 --> 00:43:15,136
he told US teachers
he was headed here

808
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:16,628
and invited US to come with him,

809
00:43:16,662 --> 00:43:18,272
and I knew you were gonna
be a little too busy

810
00:43:18,296 --> 00:43:20,098
to pick up your boys.

811
00:43:20,131 --> 00:43:21,366
- Thank you so much.

812
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:23,902
- Is Joe okay?

813
00:43:23,935 --> 00:43:25,671
- Oh, you know your brother.

814
00:43:25,704 --> 00:43:26,981
Little Joe is just
playing a game

815
00:43:27,005 --> 00:43:28,707
of hide and seek with everyone.

816
00:43:29,574 --> 00:43:30,709
A very good game.

817
00:43:31,176 --> 00:43:32,744
Don't worry, we"re
gonna find him.

818
00:43:32,778 --> 00:43:33,845
- He's dead.

819
00:43:34,379 --> 00:43:36,214
- Hey, don't say that.

820
00:43:36,247 --> 00:43:37,248
Your brother is not dead.

821
00:43:37,282 --> 00:43:38,283
- He is so.

822
00:43:38,316 --> 00:43:39,517
- It's not funny, okay.

823
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:40,862
I don't wanna hear
you say such a thing.

824
00:43:40,886 --> 00:43:42,353
- Okay.

825
00:43:42,387 --> 00:43:44,723
- I did not realize there
was gonna be so much activity

826
00:43:44,756 --> 00:43:46,725
so if you'd like, I'll
take the boys to my place

827
00:43:46,758 --> 00:43:47,993
until things quiet down.

828
00:43:48,026 --> 00:43:49,066
- That would be wonderful.

829
00:43:49,094 --> 00:43:49,861
You sure you don't mind?

830
00:43:49,895 --> 00:43:51,296
- Not at all.

831
00:43:51,329 --> 00:43:52,774
- Okay, guys, you wanna
go to miss Emma Jo's place

832
00:43:52,798 --> 00:43:53,765
for a little while?

833
00:43:53,799 --> 00:43:55,566
- No, I wanna stay with you.

834
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:57,635
- Does she have video games?

835
00:43:57,669 --> 00:44:00,872
- Yes, I do for when
my grandkids visit.

836
00:44:00,906 --> 00:44:02,173
- All right!

837
00:44:03,574 --> 00:44:04,475
- You just be a good boy and go

838
00:44:04,509 --> 00:44:06,277
take care of your brother, okay?

839
00:44:06,311 --> 00:44:07,512
I love you.

840
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:11,582
You, too, you little
knucklehead. (Laughter)

841
00:44:11,616 --> 00:44:12,818
- [Emma Jo] Come on.

842
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:15,386
- I'll call you as soon
as I know something.

843
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:23,261
Gold dust command,
this is 4-0-1.

844
00:44:23,729 --> 00:44:25,130
- [Voiceover] Go ahead, 4-0-1.

845
00:44:25,163 --> 00:44:27,308
- We've cleared all the houses
here on gold dust trail.

846
00:44:27,332 --> 00:44:28,834
Awaiting further instructions.

847
00:44:28,867 --> 00:44:31,837
- Roger, 4-0-1, have your men
head north across the street.

848
00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:33,504
Let's clear the pine
grove all the way

849
00:44:33,538 --> 00:44:35,073
up to the ward property, over.

850
00:44:37,442 --> 00:44:39,811
- That's the last of the houses.

851
00:44:39,845 --> 00:44:42,147
Chopper's gonna check
the swamp to the west.

852
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:43,448
Nothing yet.

853
00:44:43,982 --> 00:44:47,185
- We got additional
personnel (mumbles) Atv.

854
00:44:47,218 --> 00:44:48,453
- That'll help.

855
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:53,925
- Hold on a second.

856
00:45:01,399 --> 00:45:02,734
Hey, where you been?

857
00:45:04,369 --> 00:45:05,737
- Out looking.

858
00:45:05,771 --> 00:45:07,381
- Yeah, I understand what
you're feeling, Randy,

859
00:45:07,405 --> 00:45:08,740
but I'm gonna need you here.

860
00:45:09,574 --> 00:45:10,918
You got information
we that might need.

861
00:45:10,942 --> 00:45:12,043
It could be crucial.

862
00:45:13,011 --> 00:45:14,011
- Okay.

863
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:16,381
- You okay?

864
00:45:16,414 --> 00:45:17,414
- Fine.

865
00:45:18,884 --> 00:45:20,085
- All right, listen to me.

866
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:24,455
I'm gonna need you
to buck up, son.

867
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:26,591
- Buck up?

868
00:45:28,126 --> 00:45:29,828
How do I do that, Tony?

869
00:45:31,096 --> 00:45:32,964
My head is filled
with all these images.

870
00:45:33,531 --> 00:45:37,068
My son floating
face-down in a pond,

871
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:40,338
suffocating at the
bottom of a well,

872
00:45:40,872 --> 00:45:42,240
calling to me for help.

873
00:45:42,874 --> 00:45:43,809
I'm not there.

874
00:45:43,842 --> 00:45:45,343
- I get it. Randy, I do.

875
00:45:46,511 --> 00:45:48,122
But if these people
think you've given up,

876
00:45:48,146 --> 00:45:49,547
they might just
do the same thing.

877
00:45:50,448 --> 00:45:52,183
They need you to be
strong right now.

878
00:45:52,217 --> 00:45:54,419
Your son needs you to
be strong, you hear me?

879
00:45:54,452 --> 00:45:57,856
Even if you gotta fake it, you
gotta show that you got hope.

880
00:45:58,523 --> 00:45:59,767
Hell, man, we still
got several hours

881
00:45:59,791 --> 00:46:00,959
of good sunlight left.

882
00:46:00,992 --> 00:46:03,661
We got a good shot
at finding your boy.

883
00:46:06,164 --> 00:46:07,164
- I hear you, Tony.

884
00:46:07,732 --> 00:46:08,867
Thanks.

885
00:46:10,135 --> 00:46:11,736
Good man, let's go.

886
00:46:22,313 --> 00:46:23,548
- Your doctor would kill you

887
00:46:23,581 --> 00:46:25,851
if he saw you walking
on that torn achilles.

888
00:46:26,451 --> 00:46:27,618
- How is she holding up?

889
00:46:29,487 --> 00:46:30,621
- See for yourself.

890
00:46:33,825 --> 00:46:34,985
- I thought she'd be a wreck.

891
00:46:35,726 --> 00:46:37,095
- You coached her in softball.

892
00:46:37,128 --> 00:46:38,897
You know how tough she is.

893
00:46:45,070 --> 00:46:46,504
- I'm so glad you're here.

894
00:46:46,537 --> 00:46:47,873
- I come bringing good news.

895
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:51,042
We've got reporters
from channel six and 11

896
00:46:51,076 --> 00:46:52,911
on their way here now,

897
00:46:52,944 --> 00:46:54,545
and they're bringing
their helicopters.

898
00:46:55,546 --> 00:46:56,915
- We're gonna be on the news?

899
00:46:56,948 --> 00:46:58,249
- It's a good thing,

900
00:46:58,283 --> 00:46:59,851
more eyes in the sky.

901
00:46:59,885 --> 00:47:01,028
The more we put the word out,

902
00:47:01,052 --> 00:47:02,532
the more people will
keep an eye open.

903
00:47:03,088 --> 00:47:04,155
- I know you're right.

904
00:47:04,189 --> 00:47:05,523
It's wonderful. Thank you.

905
00:47:06,457 --> 00:47:08,359
Oh, I just feel like
such a terrible mom.

906
00:47:08,393 --> 00:47:10,361
- Nothing could be
further from the truth,

907
00:47:10,395 --> 00:47:11,963
and everybody here knows that.

908
00:47:15,266 --> 00:47:16,401
- Thank you.

909
00:47:26,011 --> 00:47:27,112
- I told you there must be

910
00:47:27,145 --> 00:47:28,545
a couple of hundred
people out here.

911
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:33,218
- Let US off here.

912
00:47:36,287 --> 00:47:38,487
- I'll see if there's anything
I can do up at the house.

913
00:47:39,090 --> 00:47:40,825
Please be careful.

914
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:41,858
- Okay.

915
00:47:49,434 --> 00:47:51,569
- Sir, can we give you a hand?

916
00:47:51,602 --> 00:47:55,540
- Sure, just checking for
signs the boy mighta fallen in,

917
00:47:55,573 --> 00:47:57,142
footprints, that kinda thing.

918
00:47:57,175 --> 00:47:58,643
- How's it going so far?

919
00:47:58,676 --> 00:48:00,645
- I'm concerned that we
haven't found him yet.

920
00:48:00,678 --> 00:48:02,047
When a child this
age goes missing,

921
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:04,382
the first three
hours are crucial.

922
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:08,586
The odds of finding him alive
after that drop considerably.

923
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:11,522
- How many hours
has he been missing?

924
00:48:13,558 --> 00:48:15,026
- Over four.

925
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:17,628
I hate to say this but with
all the ponds, the streams,

926
00:48:17,662 --> 00:48:20,131
the swamps, and old
Wells we got around here,

927
00:48:21,799 --> 00:48:24,369
I got a bad feeling
that he's laying

928
00:48:24,402 --> 00:48:26,071
on the bottom of one of 'em.

929
00:48:38,449 --> 00:48:39,850
- You holding up?

930
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:44,990
- Just thinking about
the coyote dens I spotted

931
00:48:45,023 --> 00:48:46,958
in the woods a
couple of weeks back,

932
00:48:47,625 --> 00:48:51,296
rattlesnakes, cotton mouths,
scorpions, everything else.

933
00:48:52,230 --> 00:48:53,965
I used to think this
place was so beautiful,

934
00:48:55,433 --> 00:48:56,667
god's country.

935
00:48:58,836 --> 00:49:00,505
It doesn't feel that way today.

936
00:49:03,874 --> 00:49:05,943
Hey, tiger, how
you doing, buddy?

937
00:49:06,711 --> 00:49:08,146
- Joe get along with your dog?

938
00:49:08,546 --> 00:49:13,284
- Yeah, well, not as well
as with Cleo, our other dog.

939
00:49:13,318 --> 00:49:15,253
Well, not our other dog.

940
00:49:15,286 --> 00:49:17,188
We're keeping her for a friend.

941
00:49:17,222 --> 00:49:18,599
I was supposed to
take her to the pound,

942
00:49:18,623 --> 00:49:20,791
but Joe and that dog
get along so well,

943
00:49:20,825 --> 00:49:22,593
I don't think i'm
gonna be able to.

944
00:49:23,361 --> 00:49:24,629
- Where's the dog now?

945
00:49:27,298 --> 00:49:30,335
- Come to think of it,
I haven't seen the dog

946
00:49:30,368 --> 00:49:31,536
since Joe disappeared,

947
00:49:31,569 --> 00:49:33,304
and she was with him
right before he did.

948
00:49:33,338 --> 00:49:34,539
You think the dog is with him?

949
00:49:34,572 --> 00:49:35,940
- It's a possibility.

950
00:49:41,179 --> 00:49:42,856
- Command to all units,
be advised that subject

951
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:46,251
was last seen with a
medium-sized black dog,

952
00:49:46,284 --> 00:49:49,320
labrador mix, answers
to the name of Cleo.

953
00:49:49,354 --> 00:49:51,489
That's Charles,
Lincoln, Edward, ocean.

954
00:49:52,223 --> 00:49:53,758
If you see the
subject or the dog,

955
00:49:53,791 --> 00:49:56,194
report to the command
post immediately, out.

956
00:49:56,861 --> 00:49:58,439
Deputy, check with that
dog's previous owner,

957
00:49:58,463 --> 00:49:59,506
and make sure he hasn't wandered

958
00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:00,898
on back home, all right?

959
00:50:07,605 --> 00:50:08,939
- [Bud] Watch your footing.

960
00:50:08,973 --> 00:50:10,584
We got four or five
groups already out there,

961
00:50:10,608 --> 00:50:12,210
and they're headed
back up this way.

962
00:50:12,243 --> 00:50:15,480
We're gonna start going
from oak grove road,

963
00:50:15,513 --> 00:50:18,549
and clear all the way up to
the area of the northwest.

964
00:50:18,583 --> 00:50:20,751
A team searched that area
a couple of hours ago.

965
00:50:20,785 --> 00:50:22,920
There's a thousand
places for him to hide.

966
00:50:22,953 --> 00:50:24,955
He could have
easily been missed.

967
00:50:24,989 --> 00:50:26,824
Report in every 20 minutes.

968
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:28,093
Good luck.

969
00:50:43,708 --> 00:50:46,711
- Hey, hey, can we join
you, me and my daddy?

970
00:50:48,846 --> 00:50:50,014
- Is he up to it?

971
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:52,283
- Oh, yeah, he'll walk
you in the ground.

972
00:50:52,317 --> 00:50:55,186
- Sure, everybody spread
out about five feet,

973
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:56,654
and start combing the area.

974
00:50:56,687 --> 00:50:57,687
- Okay.

975
00:51:03,328 --> 00:51:06,897
(Phone rings)

976
00:51:08,233 --> 00:51:09,300
- Hello.

977
00:51:09,334 --> 00:51:10,235
- [Voiceover] Mary.

978
00:51:10,268 --> 00:51:11,702
- Oh, hi, Sally.

979
00:51:11,736 --> 00:51:13,847
- [Voiceover] I just called
to see if there's any word.

980
00:51:13,871 --> 00:51:15,306
- Not yet, I'm afraid.

981
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:17,050
- [Voiceover] Ijust wanted
to let you know we have

982
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:18,976
a huge prayer chain
going for little Joe.

983
00:51:19,009 --> 00:51:21,812
I think every church in
the state has one going.

984
00:51:21,846 --> 00:51:24,449
- That's, that's just...

985
00:51:25,883 --> 00:51:27,252
- [voiceover] Are you okay?

986
00:51:28,419 --> 00:51:29,820
- I just don't think...

987
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:34,091
oh, I guess my brain isn't
functioning properly.

988
00:51:37,695 --> 00:51:40,598
I read something
recently about possums

989
00:51:40,631 --> 00:51:43,434
and the way they play dead
when they feel threatened.

990
00:51:43,834 --> 00:51:44,969
- [Voiceover] Oh?

991
00:51:45,002 --> 00:51:46,837
- Well, they don't
really play dead at all.

992
00:51:46,871 --> 00:51:50,275
Their little brains
just freeze up with fear

993
00:51:50,308 --> 00:51:51,776
and they shut down.

994
00:51:52,777 --> 00:51:53,978
- [Voiceover] Oh.

995
00:51:54,011 --> 00:51:55,491
- I think that's how
I feel right now.

996
00:51:56,046 --> 00:51:57,224
- [Voiceover] You just
hang in there, Mary,

997
00:51:57,248 --> 00:51:58,725
and just try to feel
all the love and support

998
00:51:58,749 --> 00:52:00,451
that's coming your way, okay?

999
00:52:01,752 --> 00:52:03,188
- Thank you.

1000
00:52:14,732 --> 00:52:16,443
- Hey, Chester, we went
ahead and cleared out an area

1001
00:52:16,467 --> 00:52:17,702
for your media vehicles.

1002
00:52:17,735 --> 00:52:19,036
- Thank you, sheriff.

1003
00:52:19,069 --> 00:52:20,238
I've got another question.

1004
00:52:20,271 --> 00:52:22,740
I noticed some of your
k9 units are here.

1005
00:52:22,773 --> 00:52:24,509
I'm told none of the
dogs are in the field.

1006
00:52:24,542 --> 00:52:25,710
- Yes, sir, that's correct.

1007
00:52:25,743 --> 00:52:26,977
- Why is that?

1008
00:52:27,011 --> 00:52:29,847
- It's not like you see
in the movies, Chester.

1009
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:31,849
Police dogs aren't
scent-specific.

1010
00:52:31,882 --> 00:52:33,494
They can't just pick
up one person's scent

1011
00:52:33,518 --> 00:52:35,052
and track it in a crowd.

1012
00:52:35,085 --> 00:52:36,530
With all the searchers
we got in the field,

1013
00:52:36,554 --> 00:52:38,623
it's just a waste of
time to deploy 'em.

1014
00:52:38,656 --> 00:52:40,625
- I see. That's a real shame.

1015
00:52:41,091 --> 00:52:45,263
- What about that woman up
in polk county, Tracy sosha.

1016
00:52:45,296 --> 00:52:47,432
- I know her but, I mean,

1017
00:52:47,465 --> 00:52:49,734
my k9 officers doubt her dogs

1018
00:52:49,767 --> 00:52:52,069
can do anything our dogs can't.

1019
00:52:52,102 --> 00:52:53,838
- Don't you think
it's worth a try?

1020
00:52:53,871 --> 00:52:56,641
I mean it might make christal
feel that more is being done,

1021
00:52:56,674 --> 00:52:58,108
if you understand.

1022
00:52:58,142 --> 00:53:00,778
- If you think it'll help, I'll
be happy to give her a call.

1023
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:04,048
- The media has arrived.

1024
00:53:11,121 --> 00:53:13,324
- Chester Gibson, thank
you so much for coming.

1025
00:53:13,358 --> 00:53:14,959
- It's our pleasure, Mr. Gibson.

1026
00:53:14,992 --> 00:53:16,193
I just hope we can help.

1027
00:53:16,227 --> 00:53:17,462
Where can we set up?

1028
00:53:17,495 --> 00:53:19,930
- The sheriff has got
a place right up here.

1029
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:24,502
The command post
is right up here.

1030
00:53:24,535 --> 00:53:27,472
You can get a briefing from
chief Thomas of fire rescue,

1031
00:53:27,505 --> 00:53:29,407
and sheriff Reeves,

1032
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:31,141
and I'll see if
the family is up to

1033
00:53:31,175 --> 00:53:32,710
granting an interview as well.

1034
00:53:32,743 --> 00:53:34,979
- Oh, good, I'd like to
do that as soon as I can.

1035
00:53:35,012 --> 00:53:36,281
- Of course.

1036
00:53:37,282 --> 00:53:38,649
- [Voiceover] Hey, Joe!

1037
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:43,153
- [Voiceover] Joe!

1038
00:53:52,663 --> 00:53:53,831
- [Voiceover] Joe!

1039
00:54:04,942 --> 00:54:06,143
- What you thinking, daddy?

1040
00:54:09,547 --> 00:54:11,215
- I'm thinking we
oughta head this way.

1041
00:54:13,884 --> 00:54:15,553
- These guys are
moving too slow.

1042
00:54:15,586 --> 00:54:17,888
I think we can do
better on our own.

1043
00:54:17,922 --> 00:54:19,390
- Let's go.

1044
00:54:25,496 --> 00:54:27,508
- Currently, we have eight
search teams in the field,

1045
00:54:27,532 --> 00:54:29,334
plus numerous officers on atvs.

1046
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,345
In fact, we have
so many searchers,

1047
00:54:31,369 --> 00:54:33,237
the American red cross
set up an aid station

1048
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:35,205
to provide food and
water for everybody.

1049
00:54:35,239 --> 00:54:37,007
- It also looks like
you have a large number

1050
00:54:37,041 --> 00:54:38,643
of community volunteers.

1051
00:54:38,676 --> 00:54:41,679
Is it common that so many
people will turn out like this

1052
00:54:41,712 --> 00:54:44,382
to help look for
a missing child?

1053
00:54:44,415 --> 00:54:45,850
- No.

1054
00:54:47,652 --> 00:54:49,812
No, I've never seen anything
like it before in my life.

1055
00:54:50,855 --> 00:54:52,566
As a professional, i'm
concerned about the number

1056
00:54:52,590 --> 00:54:54,625
of untrained searchers
in the field,

1057
00:54:54,659 --> 00:54:56,927
but as a human being,

1058
00:55:01,699 --> 00:55:03,601
as a human being, it
kinda restores your faith

1059
00:55:03,634 --> 00:55:05,970
in the goodness of people,
if you know what I mean.

1060
00:55:06,737 --> 00:55:07,805
That's all, thank you.

1061
00:55:09,907 --> 00:55:11,041
- Yeah, I got it.

1062
00:55:46,444 --> 00:55:51,315
(Dramatic music)

1063
00:57:10,327 --> 00:57:13,097
- [Voiceover] I don't want
you working in the store, Joe.

1064
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:14,765
You're not in class.

1065
00:57:14,799 --> 00:57:16,066
I want you to be studying

1066
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:18,235
or socializing with
your classmates.

1067
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:20,337
- I just thought Danny
could use a hand today.

1068
00:57:20,370 --> 00:57:22,607
I could always use
the extra money.

1069
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:24,809
- Don't worry about the money.

1070
00:57:24,842 --> 00:57:26,310
There'll be plenty of time later

1071
00:57:26,343 --> 00:57:28,112
to worry about the
money, believe me.

1072
00:57:28,846 --> 00:57:30,686
- I just don't wanna be
a burden on the family.

1073
00:57:31,248 --> 00:57:32,449
- You're not.

1074
00:57:33,217 --> 00:57:35,152
Sylvia and I are very
proud of you, Joe.

1075
00:57:35,185 --> 00:57:37,054
We want you to
enjoy these years.

1076
00:57:37,087 --> 00:57:39,790
You worked the entire time you
was in high school, remember?

1077
00:57:40,691 --> 00:57:41,726
- Thank you.

1078
00:57:46,797 --> 00:57:48,465
- Where are you, Joe?

1079
00:57:52,637 --> 00:57:53,738
- What's that, daddy?

1080
00:57:54,705 --> 00:57:56,173
- Nothing.

1081
00:57:58,475 --> 00:58:00,945
- [Voiceover] I appreciate
(Mumbles), little brother.

1082
00:58:01,679 --> 00:58:03,047
I gotta get.

1083
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:05,080
Lockheed doesn't like their
supervisors to be late.

1084
00:58:05,516 --> 00:58:08,052
- Say, they're not really
gonna let you build planes

1085
00:58:08,085 --> 00:58:09,920
people are gonna
fly in, are they?

1086
00:58:09,954 --> 00:58:11,455
- You rascal.

1087
00:58:12,422 --> 00:58:14,692
- All right, what
you got, huh, huh?

1088
00:58:16,694 --> 00:58:18,763
- Who's the old man now, boy?

1089
00:58:20,097 --> 00:58:21,298
I'll see you in the morning.

1090
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:23,100
- All right, see you at home.

1091
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:27,772
- [Voiceover] See you, ed.

1092
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:31,642
- [Voiceover] Get in the car!

1093
00:58:31,676 --> 00:58:32,810
All right, let's go!

1094
00:58:34,579 --> 00:58:37,481
(Tires squeal)

1095
00:58:42,252 --> 00:58:44,589
- You're thinking about your
little brother, aren't you?

1096
00:58:45,189 --> 00:58:46,290
- Maybe a little.

1097
00:58:47,391 --> 00:58:48,726
A little.

1098
00:58:51,295 --> 00:58:54,331
There's always also
thinking about where I'd be

1099
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:56,667
if I was a boy, where I'd go.

1100
00:58:57,201 --> 00:59:00,137
When I was little, I
used to play back there,

1101
00:59:00,170 --> 00:59:03,340
around there where four
farms come together.

1102
00:59:04,975 --> 00:59:06,443
That was a lifetime ago, though.

1103
00:59:07,812 --> 00:59:10,380
- It hasn't changed that
much, let's go check it out.

1104
00:59:10,414 --> 00:59:11,782
- All right, let's go.

1105
00:59:16,987 --> 00:59:18,723
- Copy, stand by.

1106
00:59:18,756 --> 00:59:20,324
- [Voiceover] Copy
that, standing by.

1107
00:59:22,627 --> 00:59:23,770
- The team has found some marks

1108
00:59:23,794 --> 00:59:25,863
at the edge of a
pond in area four.

1109
00:59:25,896 --> 00:59:27,898
The locals call it grace lake.

1110
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:30,601
- That area was
searched earlier.

1111
00:59:30,635 --> 00:59:31,969
They reported nothing.

1112
00:59:32,469 --> 00:59:34,404
- It's possible the previous
team made the marks.

1113
00:59:34,438 --> 00:59:36,373
- Or they missed them.

1114
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:37,908
I have a dive team ready to go.

1115
00:59:40,277 --> 00:59:42,079
- It's the first lead
we've had all day.

1116
00:59:42,112 --> 00:59:43,280
Go ahead and deploy 'em.

1117
00:59:43,313 --> 00:59:44,915
We better do it while
it's still light.

1118
00:59:45,549 --> 00:59:48,686
- Bud, be discreet.

1119
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:50,831
Have 'em access the
pond from the side

1120
00:59:50,855 --> 00:59:53,157
and use a secure radio channel.

1121
00:59:53,190 --> 00:59:55,826
If they find out that
we're dragging the pond...

1122
00:59:58,428 --> 01:00:01,131
- sheriff, the chopper needs
to return to base to refuel.

1123
01:00:01,165 --> 01:00:02,599
- Send 'em.

1124
01:00:02,633 --> 01:00:03,744
- My station has given me
clearance for our chopper

1125
01:00:03,768 --> 01:00:05,269
to assist in the search.

1126
01:00:05,302 --> 01:00:08,338
- There you go, sheriff, now
you got another helicopter.

1127
01:00:08,372 --> 01:00:09,950
- I'm gonna need to
get a deputy on board

1128
01:00:09,974 --> 01:00:11,676
to coordinate the search.

1129
01:00:11,709 --> 01:00:14,378
Bert, you know the area.

1130
01:00:14,411 --> 01:00:15,545
- You want me to cram myself

1131
01:00:15,579 --> 01:00:17,314
in one of those
flying contraptions?

1132
01:00:17,347 --> 01:00:18,916
- [Chester] It's
for a good cause.

1133
01:00:18,949 --> 01:00:20,517
- I guess you got a point.

1134
01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:22,753
I hope that thing's
got a barf bag.

1135
01:00:46,143 --> 01:00:47,678
- Be careful what
you shoot out there.

1136
01:00:47,712 --> 01:00:49,322
I've been on almost a
dozen of these searches,

1137
01:00:49,346 --> 01:00:51,682
and they never have
a happy ending.

1138
01:00:51,716 --> 01:00:53,417
- Got it, no close-ups
of a two-year-old

1139
01:00:53,450 --> 01:00:55,619
floating face-down on the 5:00.

1140
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:56,987
- At least no close-ups.

1141
01:00:59,556 --> 01:01:01,859
- Hey, I'm Jack graves.

1142
01:01:01,892 --> 01:01:03,660
- Sergeant deputy Bert Smith,

1143
01:01:03,694 --> 01:01:05,963
carroll county
sheriff's department.

1144
01:01:05,996 --> 01:01:07,832
You keep this thing
nice and level,

1145
01:01:07,865 --> 01:01:09,800
and you and I'll
get along just fine.

1146
01:01:24,114 --> 01:01:25,415
- [Voiceover] Watch that hook!

1147
01:01:25,449 --> 01:01:27,718
- [Voiceover] Got it.

1148
01:01:27,752 --> 01:01:29,186
- [Voiceover] All
right, let's dive.

1149
01:01:43,901 --> 01:01:47,304
- Bud, we only got about
an hour of light left.

1150
01:01:47,337 --> 01:01:48,605
Let's recall a couple of teams

1151
01:01:48,638 --> 01:01:50,540
and get 'em equipped
for night ops.

1152
01:01:51,575 --> 01:01:55,112
- Team two and team five,
return to gold dust command.

1153
01:01:55,145 --> 01:01:57,547
- [Voiceover] Repeat,
return to gold dust command.

1154
01:01:58,749 --> 01:01:59,917
- I don't understand.

1155
01:01:59,950 --> 01:02:01,394
Why are they recalling
the search teams?

1156
01:02:01,418 --> 01:02:03,020
They haven't even found him yet.

1157
01:02:03,053 --> 01:02:04,421
- Don't worry, it's routine.

1158
01:02:04,454 --> 01:02:05,689
They'll be re-deployed.

1159
01:02:06,490 --> 01:02:09,059
- I am worried. I'm
worried to death.

1160
01:02:09,093 --> 01:02:11,028
Why can't they find him
with all these people?

1161
01:02:11,762 --> 01:02:13,273
My little boy is about
to be out in the dark

1162
01:02:13,297 --> 01:02:15,065
without his momma and...

1163
01:02:37,087 --> 01:02:38,789
- You think he
could be in there?

1164
01:02:38,823 --> 01:02:41,058
- When I was a kid, I
played in these woods.

1165
01:02:42,292 --> 01:02:43,703
- How could he have
gotten past this fence?

1166
01:02:43,727 --> 01:02:45,562
This bottom wire's electrified.

1167
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:47,064
Why would he have even tried?

1168
01:02:48,698 --> 01:02:50,210
- We've been looking in
places that have already

1169
01:02:50,234 --> 01:02:52,102
been searched since we got here.

1170
01:02:52,803 --> 01:02:54,204
Nobody's looking in there.

1171
01:02:54,238 --> 01:02:55,772
- Yeah, for a reason.

1172
01:02:57,942 --> 01:02:59,343
- [Ed] Yeah, well.

1173
01:03:00,811 --> 01:03:02,446
- Hell, it's worth a try.

1174
01:03:03,713 --> 01:03:05,358
Keep it spread out while
I get in there, okay?

1175
01:03:05,382 --> 01:03:06,583
- [Teddy] All right.

1176
01:03:09,453 --> 01:03:10,587
- [Tony] Christal.

1177
01:03:11,455 --> 01:03:13,790
This is Tracy sargent,
her dog cinco.

1178
01:03:13,824 --> 01:03:15,059
- Thank you for coming.

1179
01:03:15,292 --> 01:03:17,027
Miss sargent figures
our best shot here is

1180
01:03:17,061 --> 01:03:20,130
to bring cinco in to where
Joe's scent is the freshest,

1181
01:03:20,164 --> 01:03:22,166
namely his room, if that's okay.

1182
01:03:22,199 --> 01:03:23,400
- Of course.

1183
01:03:23,433 --> 01:03:24,835
- [Tony] Good luck.

1184
01:03:33,277 --> 01:03:34,277
- [Tracy] Check it.

1185
01:03:39,416 --> 01:03:40,416
Check it.

1186
01:03:41,018 --> 01:03:42,686
(Objects fall to floor)

1187
01:03:52,496 --> 01:03:53,563
Very good.

1188
01:03:58,068 --> 01:03:59,069
- (Giggles)

1189
01:03:59,103 --> 01:04:01,771
- Mommy, look, mommy, look!

1190
01:04:03,407 --> 01:04:04,407
- Joe.

1191
01:04:05,409 --> 01:04:06,710
- (Mumbles)

1192
01:04:07,011 --> 01:04:07,878
- Good job.

1193
01:04:07,912 --> 01:04:09,779
How about we (mumbles)?

1194
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:11,548
- Yeah.

1195
01:04:11,581 --> 01:04:13,150
- Yeah, that's a good idea.

1196
01:04:14,618 --> 01:04:15,685
- Yep.

1197
01:04:15,719 --> 01:04:17,187
- Oh, Joe!

1198
01:04:17,221 --> 01:04:18,588
- I'm okay!

1199
01:04:18,622 --> 01:04:21,926
- (Laughs) You're okay,
come here to me, you rascal.

1200
01:04:22,492 --> 01:04:26,997
- Oh! Oh! I think it's time

1201
01:04:27,031 --> 01:04:29,099
for tickle war, oh!

1202
01:04:30,034 --> 01:04:32,269
(Laughs)

1203
01:04:32,302 --> 01:04:36,673
- Are you ticklish
right there? (Laughter)

1204
01:04:38,675 --> 01:04:41,345
(Christal cries)

1205
01:04:43,180 --> 01:04:43,813
- [Tracy] Check it.

1206
01:04:43,847 --> 01:04:44,847
(Christal cries)

1207
01:04:46,550 --> 01:04:47,550
- [Tracy] Check it.

1208
01:04:50,787 --> 01:04:51,855
Very good.

1209
01:04:53,457 --> 01:04:55,892
(Christal cries)

1210
01:05:00,397 --> 01:05:03,867
(Christal cries)

1211
01:05:20,951 --> 01:05:23,320
- I don't know if christal
can take much more.

1212
01:05:25,289 --> 01:05:26,856
I feel it will kill
her if I tell her

1213
01:05:26,890 --> 01:05:28,192
what I think I have to.

1214
01:05:29,293 --> 01:05:30,760
- I understand.

1215
01:05:30,794 --> 01:05:33,397
- I asked sheriff Reeves
that if worse comes to worse,

1216
01:05:34,631 --> 01:05:37,067
if they find Joe and he's...

1217
01:05:39,369 --> 01:05:42,572
that I be the one to bring that
news to christal and Randy.

1218
01:05:44,241 --> 01:05:47,411
For some reason, I think that
that time is coming very soon.

1219
01:05:49,479 --> 01:05:50,814
I just feel it.

1220
01:05:57,421 --> 01:05:59,156
- Randy, any news yet?

1221
01:05:59,189 --> 01:06:00,824
- Not right yet, momma.

1222
01:06:05,529 --> 01:06:07,897
- Look, it's your dad.

1223
01:06:19,809 --> 01:06:20,977
- What's wrong?

1224
01:06:22,279 --> 01:06:24,048
- I'm gonna get the pumps

1225
01:06:24,081 --> 01:06:26,750
and start dragging
those pits by our pond.

1226
01:06:26,783 --> 01:06:28,185
- But I checked them.

1227
01:06:28,218 --> 01:06:29,819
- So did I. It don't matter.

1228
01:06:29,853 --> 01:06:31,064
He could have fallen
in and got trapped

1229
01:06:31,088 --> 01:06:33,423
underneath the surface
and never left a trace.

1230
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:37,894
Most likely, he was
headed over to our place,

1231
01:06:37,927 --> 01:06:39,296
and we know he never made it,

1232
01:06:39,329 --> 01:06:44,000
and those pits are on the way.

1233
01:07:27,744 --> 01:07:28,778
- Daddy!

1234
01:07:32,449 --> 01:07:33,717
- Yeah!

1235
01:07:33,750 --> 01:07:35,919
- Found a coyote's den
but it's abandoned.

1236
01:07:37,354 --> 01:07:38,388
You okay?

1237
01:07:38,988 --> 01:07:40,124
- Fine.

1238
01:07:40,157 --> 01:07:41,591
- We been at this a while now.

1239
01:07:41,625 --> 01:07:42,959
What say we head on back.

1240
01:07:42,992 --> 01:07:44,961
I don't want you to
overdo it in here.

1241
01:07:46,263 --> 01:07:48,132
- [Ed] Let's just go
another 10 feet or so.

1242
01:07:51,168 --> 01:07:53,002
- Okay, go easy.

1243
01:08:01,745 --> 01:08:02,745
- [Ed] Sylvia.

1244
01:08:04,948 --> 01:08:06,049
How is he?

1245
01:08:06,082 --> 01:08:08,318
- I'm waiting to
hear from Dr. Paul.

1246
01:08:08,352 --> 01:08:10,954
All they've told me is
that he was in a car crash.

1247
01:08:12,389 --> 01:08:14,524
Dan said he was running
something to the house.

1248
01:08:14,791 --> 01:08:16,793
- Oh, a battery charger.

1249
01:08:16,826 --> 01:08:18,128
I asked him to do it.

1250
01:08:19,429 --> 01:08:20,464
Mm hmm.

1251
01:08:21,231 --> 01:08:22,666
- It's not your fault.

1252
01:08:24,568 --> 01:08:25,568
- Yeah.

1253
01:08:27,737 --> 01:08:30,574
Oh, god, please, lord.

1254
01:08:31,141 --> 01:08:33,310
Let our Joseph be all right,

1255
01:08:33,343 --> 01:08:35,779
if it be thy will,
god, bless you.

1256
01:08:39,082 --> 01:08:41,518
- I'm so sorry, but there
was nothing that we could do.

1257
01:08:41,551 --> 01:08:43,820
He broke his neck when he
was thrown free from the car,

1258
01:08:43,853 --> 01:08:45,531
and he died before they
could get him here.

1259
01:08:45,555 --> 01:08:46,956
It was probably instantaneous,

1260
01:08:47,757 --> 01:08:49,826
no suffering if that's
any consolation.

1261
01:08:51,295 --> 01:08:55,465
(Sylvia cries)

1262
01:09:02,005 --> 01:09:03,407
- I'm coming for you, Joe.

1263
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:05,375
I'm coming for you.

1264
01:09:29,132 --> 01:09:30,200
- What's that?

1265
01:09:37,907 --> 01:09:39,276
- It's the dog!

1266
01:09:39,309 --> 01:09:41,349
The black dog, just like
the one in the description.

1267
01:09:43,179 --> 01:09:44,914
I lost him. Hang on.

1268
01:09:59,363 --> 01:10:00,430
Anything?

1269
01:10:01,398 --> 01:10:02,732
- I can't see a damn thing.

1270
01:10:02,766 --> 01:10:04,301
I'll call into (mumbles).

1271
01:10:05,068 --> 01:10:06,246
- [Voiceover] Gold dust command,

1272
01:10:06,270 --> 01:10:07,713
we have spotted a black
dog in the tree line

1273
01:10:07,737 --> 01:10:10,540
matching the description two
miles to the north-northwest

1274
01:10:10,574 --> 01:10:12,075
(mumbles).

1275
01:10:12,709 --> 01:10:14,378
- Copy, two miles
north-northwest.

1276
01:10:15,912 --> 01:10:17,647
- You found the
dog, that's great.

1277
01:10:17,681 --> 01:10:20,116
- Can I tag along while
you tell the family?

1278
01:10:21,285 --> 01:10:23,420
Best hold off on that
for a minute (mumbles).

1279
01:10:23,453 --> 01:10:24,630
The dog's gonna
stick with the boy

1280
01:10:24,654 --> 01:10:25,855
whether he's alive or dead.

1281
01:10:25,889 --> 01:10:27,424
Let US find out
which it is first.

1282
01:10:39,536 --> 01:10:40,837
- I've got something!

1283
01:10:46,376 --> 01:10:48,211
- I got movement
in the tree line,

1284
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:50,079
directly north of our position.

1285
01:10:50,780 --> 01:10:51,924
- [Voiceover] Copy, aerial unit.

1286
01:10:51,948 --> 01:10:53,417
We're converging
on your position.

1287
01:11:02,326 --> 01:11:05,194
- I got the boy!
He's coming out.

1288
01:11:14,103 --> 01:11:15,705
- That don't look right.

1289
01:11:30,354 --> 01:11:31,864
- [Voiceover] Command,
it's a false alarm.

1290
01:11:31,888 --> 01:11:35,058
It was the wrong dog and a
couple of boys with a bb gun.

1291
01:11:35,091 --> 01:11:37,293
We'll continue our
search pattern.

1292
01:11:37,327 --> 01:11:38,462
- Copy that.

1293
01:11:42,966 --> 01:11:43,966
- (Mumbles)

1294
01:11:44,734 --> 01:11:45,969
- Thanks.

1295
01:11:49,272 --> 01:11:51,675
We should go ahead
and recall everybody.

1296
01:11:51,708 --> 01:11:53,843
Give 'em a chance to get
back here before dark.

1297
01:11:54,544 --> 01:11:56,825
You know we just lost our best
chance of finding that boy.

1298
01:11:57,814 --> 01:11:58,882
- I know that, Tony.

1299
01:12:00,216 --> 01:12:01,461
Once we'ere into night opticals,

1300
01:12:01,485 --> 01:12:02,662
it goes from finding a
needle in a haystack,

1301
01:12:02,686 --> 01:12:04,554
to finding a needle
in a stack of needles!

1302
01:12:12,128 --> 01:12:13,730
- [Voiceover]
(Mumbles) To all teams,

1303
01:12:13,763 --> 01:12:14,998
return to gold dust command

1304
01:12:15,031 --> 01:12:17,667
to await further
instructions for night ops.

1305
01:12:17,701 --> 01:12:19,869
Repeat, (mumbles) Of all teams,

1306
01:12:19,903 --> 01:12:22,105
return to gold dust command.

1307
01:12:29,145 --> 01:12:30,614
- [Teddy] Hey, daddy!

1308
01:12:31,915 --> 01:12:34,250
We should head back before
it gets too dark in here.

1309
01:12:35,985 --> 01:12:37,153
- Okay.

1310
01:12:40,023 --> 01:12:42,358
Stay where you are.
I'll come to you.

1311
01:13:54,297 --> 01:13:56,332
(Dog barks)

1312
01:14:10,547 --> 01:14:11,815
- Joe!

1313
01:14:24,961 --> 01:14:26,730
Teddy! I found him!

1314
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:39,976
Hey, Joe, I bet you like
tractors, don't you?

1315
01:14:40,544 --> 01:14:42,345
Would you like to
go ride in one?

1316
01:14:44,814 --> 01:14:46,583
Would you like to go see mommy?

1317
01:14:47,884 --> 01:14:49,285
Come on, come on!

1318
01:14:51,187 --> 01:14:54,223
Oh, thank you, lord, thank you!

1319
01:15:01,430 --> 01:15:02,599
Thank you, lord.

1320
01:15:05,769 --> 01:15:09,472
- Oh! Well, I'll be! (Laughter)

1321
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:10,707
Hallelujah.

1322
01:15:10,740 --> 01:15:12,642
You want me to carry
him outta here?

1323
01:15:13,342 --> 01:15:16,479
Yeah, yeah, that's
where we're going.

1324
01:15:36,833 --> 01:15:39,235
- We found him. He's alive.

1325
01:16:07,664 --> 01:16:09,332
- [Voiceover] They
found little Joe.

1326
01:16:09,365 --> 01:16:10,734
- [Voiceover] Good
job, great work.

1327
01:16:15,271 --> 01:16:17,006
- [Randy] Where is he?

1328
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:41,464
(Cleo barks)

1329
01:16:52,842 --> 01:16:57,413
(Crowd cheers)

1330
01:17:11,227 --> 01:17:12,495
- [Randy] You okay?

1331
01:17:27,243 --> 01:17:28,311
Thank you!

1332
01:17:50,333 --> 01:17:52,068
- [Joe] Ride pawpaw's bike.

1333
01:17:55,171 --> 01:17:57,073
Ride pawpaw's bike.

1334
01:17:57,106 --> 01:17:59,508
- Oh, no, baby, you can't
ride pawpaw's bike right now.

1335
01:17:59,542 --> 01:18:00,810
- [Joe] Ride pawpaw's bike!

1336
01:18:00,844 --> 01:18:02,211
- Oh, no, no, no, no, Joe.

1337
01:18:02,245 --> 01:18:04,714
I'm not letting you
go anywhere right now.

1338
01:18:07,984 --> 01:18:12,588
(Applause) (Cheers)

1339
01:18:17,526 --> 01:18:19,963
- Thank you very
much. Thank you much.

1340
01:18:24,801 --> 01:18:26,169
Thank you.

1341
01:18:35,178 --> 01:18:38,681
I wanna thank god for
watching over our boy today,

1342
01:18:38,714 --> 01:18:42,351
and for ed Walker
and his son, Terry.

1343
01:18:42,385 --> 01:18:43,319
- Moo cows!

1344
01:18:43,352 --> 01:18:44,854
- What was that, young man?

1345
01:18:44,888 --> 01:18:46,522
You said something
about moo cows?

1346
01:18:46,555 --> 01:18:48,491
- Shoot moo cows. (Laughter)

1347
01:18:48,524 --> 01:18:50,960
- He was trying to
shoot the moo cows.

1348
01:18:50,994 --> 01:18:52,461
That's how he got lost.

1349
01:18:54,563 --> 01:18:56,532
She's a really good dog.

1350
01:18:56,565 --> 01:18:58,201
She stayed with
him the whole day.

1351
01:18:58,234 --> 01:19:00,369
I guess we can't take her
to the pound now, huh?

1352
01:19:01,905 --> 01:19:04,974
- Look out, look out,
Joe, for you, all right!

1353
01:19:05,942 --> 01:19:07,510
Fireman Joe!

1354
01:19:32,301 --> 01:19:33,937
(Joe giggles)

1355
01:19:37,173 --> 01:19:39,375
- You guys, this is ed.

1356
01:19:42,445 --> 01:19:44,780
This is his son, Terry.

1357
01:20:07,670 --> 01:20:10,406
- Thank you for
finding my brother.

1358
01:20:10,439 --> 01:20:13,442
- You're welcome.
You're welcome, buddy,

1359
01:20:13,476 --> 01:20:15,078
both of you.

1360
01:20:36,132 --> 01:20:38,034
- [Voiceover] Have a good night.

1361
01:20:38,067 --> 01:20:39,735
I'll call you tomorrow.

1362
01:20:40,636 --> 01:20:43,739
- [Voiceover] Hey, bud,
later, thank you again.

1363
01:21:04,961 --> 01:21:06,963
(Randy sighs)

1364
01:21:13,736 --> 01:21:15,004
- You okay?

1365
01:21:15,905 --> 01:21:17,406
- I can't believe he's back.

1366
01:21:18,674 --> 01:21:20,543
I was convinced we'd lost him,

1367
01:21:20,576 --> 01:21:21,978
that I lost him.

1368
01:21:26,249 --> 01:21:28,851
There's something
I wanna tell you,

1369
01:21:29,852 --> 01:21:31,820
that I want to tell him.

1370
01:21:33,522 --> 01:21:34,522
- Okay.

1371
01:21:35,224 --> 01:21:36,459
- Will you prray with me?

1372
01:21:36,492 --> 01:21:37,760
- Of course.

1373
01:21:40,896 --> 01:21:44,067
- Dear lord, thank you
for returning Joe to US,

1374
01:21:45,568 --> 01:21:48,671
and for giving me a second
chance to be a better father

1375
01:21:50,173 --> 01:21:51,574
and a husband.

1376
01:21:57,981 --> 01:22:02,018
Lord, I feel like you
grabbed me and slapped me,

1377
01:22:02,351 --> 01:22:05,921
and showed me what's
important in life.

1378
01:22:05,955 --> 01:22:10,693
I promise from now on
to put you and my family

1379
01:22:10,726 --> 01:22:13,562
first in my heart and actions,

1380
01:22:14,797 --> 01:22:18,467
and to find a way to somehow
give back to all those

1381
01:22:18,501 --> 01:22:20,603
who helped US today.

1382
01:22:21,504 --> 01:22:25,808
I'm so overwhelmed by your love

1383
01:22:25,841 --> 01:22:29,645
and so grateful to you.

1384
01:22:29,678 --> 01:22:32,548
Thank you for giving me
a chance to see all that,

1385
01:22:33,816 --> 01:22:38,821
and for giving me such a
wonderful family and wife.

1386
01:22:42,425 --> 01:22:44,793
In Jesus' name, amen.

1387
01:22:44,827 --> 01:22:46,162
- Amen.

1388
01:22:48,264 --> 01:22:49,298
I love you.

1389
01:22:50,733 --> 01:22:51,734
- I love you.

1390
01:23:03,112 --> 01:23:06,882
Man, I could use a vacation.

1391
01:23:11,020 --> 01:23:12,088
- You still wanna go?

1392
01:23:13,956 --> 01:23:15,091
- Yeah, don't you?

1393
01:23:16,092 --> 01:23:17,526
