1
00:02:24,292 --> 00:02:27,296
(Scott) 'September 9th, 1904,

2
00:02:27,417 --> 00:02:30,341
'on board the Discovery,
homeward bound from the Antarctic.

3
00:02:31,958 --> 00:02:34,256
'I've added a little, I hope,
to the knowledge gleaned

4
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:38,960
'by Captain Cook, Sir James Ross
and other explorers before me.

5
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:42,166
'But I have only touched
the fringe of things.

6
00:02:42,292 --> 00:02:44,636
'I leave behind a whole continent,

7
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:48,380
'vast, mysterious, inhospitable,

8
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,800
'and still, to all intents
and purposes, unknown.'

9
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,719
- Well, good night, Scott.
- Good night, sir.

10
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:29,167
I'm sorry, but that's how the land lies.

11
00:04:29,292 --> 00:04:32,045
- Thank you. Good night.
- Good luck to you.

12
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:53,673
- Sit up a little, Con.
- Hm?

13
00:04:53,792 --> 00:04:55,419
- Sit up.
- Hm, sorry.

14
00:04:59,417 --> 00:05:01,260
Something's gone wrong, hasn't it?

15
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:03,298
You can't go ahead.

16
00:05:03,417 --> 00:05:04,964
Oh, we can go ahead, all right.

17
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:07,302
The Treasury won't let us
have the money, that's all.

18
00:05:07,417 --> 00:05:09,545
- Is that very bad?
- Yes.

19
00:05:09,667 --> 00:05:11,715
It means I get the men
but not the backing.

20
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:16,084
- I should have to make a public appeal.
- Well, why don't you?

21
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:21,758
You see, if I do go ahead with this show,
I might lose my chance in the Navy.

22
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:23,843
That would mean
looking for some other job,

23
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:28,463
and that would mean discomfort
and unpleasantness for you.

24
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,752
As far as I'm concerned,
I'd take it on any day.

25
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:35,379
As far as we're concerned, Con,
any day.

26
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,674
You knew the Antarctic
long before you knew me.

27
00:05:38,792 --> 00:05:40,794
I always knew you'd go back.

28
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:44,003
And I'm not the least jealous.

29
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:46,924
As a matter of fact, I don't think
I'd love you so much if you didn't.

30
00:05:47,042 --> 00:05:49,386
Don't move, Con.

31
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,673
Do you remember
walking along the sands

32
00:05:51,792 --> 00:05:54,511
just after the tide had gone out?

33
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:57,595
I asked you what exploration
really meant to you.

34
00:05:58,417 --> 00:06:00,294
The sands were still wet,

35
00:06:00,417 --> 00:06:04,376
and you said, "The fascination
of making the first footmarks."

36
00:06:07,042 --> 00:06:09,295
I'm a very, very lucky man.

37
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:26,378
Now, what shall it be?

38
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:31,711
"I appeal with confidence"
or "I confidently appeal"?

39
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:34,586
"It is with confidence
that we appeal..."

40
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,922
Lunch!

41
00:06:58,375 --> 00:07:00,298
Lunch is ready, dear.

42
00:07:00,417 --> 00:07:02,090
Just in time, Oriana.

43
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:05,417
- What is it?
- A flea, a rare one.

44
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:08,927
Just hold him while I get some spirit
to preserve him.

45
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:31,173
No ordinary flea, Oriana.

46
00:07:31,292 --> 00:07:33,590
I'll send him to Rothschild
for his collection.

47
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:36,461
You might as well
send him my soufflé too.

48
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:38,961
- Is that done now?
- Yes, quite done.

49
00:07:40,417 --> 00:07:42,090
Never mind.

50
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:44,051
Oh, how's the drawing going?

51
00:07:44,167 --> 00:07:46,841
Natterer's Bat. Lovely name.

52
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:50,460
Oh, isn't it heavenly here?

53
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:52,210
All on our own.

54
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:54,677
- Except for dead bats.
- And very dead grouse.

55
00:07:54,792 --> 00:07:57,762
I wish they wouldn't keep
sending them to you on your holiday.

56
00:07:57,875 --> 00:07:59,297
(Car engine backfiring)

57
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:02,255
I'll go and see.

58
00:08:03,667 --> 00:08:07,092
Natterer's Bat.

59
00:08:10,417 --> 00:08:13,876
Did you hear me, Mrs Wilson?
I suppose you couldn't help it.

60
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,709
I came here by motor car.
I've left it exhausted alongside the gate.

61
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:21,007
- How far have you come?
- The last lap was nearly a mile.

62
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:23,878
- Bill about?
- Yes. Do you want him?

63
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,422
Er, yes, I do rather.

64
00:08:25,542 --> 00:08:28,796
- Well, he's working, you know.
- Yes, I know.

65
00:08:28,917 --> 00:08:30,043
- He's...
- Working.

66
00:08:32,042 --> 00:08:33,464
Come along.

67
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:41,087
- That noise was Captain Scott.
- Hello, Con.

68
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:42,926
- Hello, Bill.
- Haven't seen you lately.

69
00:08:43,042 --> 00:08:45,261
You forget, Captain Scott's
been on his honeymoon.

70
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:47,423
Well, as a matter of fact,
I've been rather busy,

71
00:08:47,542 --> 00:08:49,886
but we hope to have a honeymoon
someday, somewhere.

72
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:52,301
Well, Con?

73
00:08:52,417 --> 00:08:54,090
What's up?

74
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:56,882
Shackleton hasn't done it, Bill.
He nearly did but not quite.

75
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:58,876
I'm going back.

76
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:02,426
Shall we go in?

77
00:09:09,042 --> 00:09:13,172
- Mind if I kick it up a bit?
- No, carry on. They're your boots.

78
00:09:13,292 --> 00:09:15,169
How far did Shackleton get?

79
00:09:15,292 --> 00:09:17,966
He got to within 90 miles of the Pole.

80
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:21,542
- Isn't 90 miles near enough?
- No.

81
00:09:21,667 --> 00:09:25,342
Because it isn't it.
It's not the South Pole.

82
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:27,552
That's still there, waiting.

83
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:30,716
And, er, I think an Englishman
should get there first.

84
00:09:32,667 --> 00:09:34,510
Well, Bill? What do you say?

85
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:36,298
There's my work
for the Grouse Commission.

86
00:09:36,417 --> 00:09:39,626
That's no obstacle.
We shan't be leaving for at least a year.

87
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:43,837
I think my exploring days are over.

88
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:47,167
I don't want to get somewhere first
just for the sake of doing it.

89
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:50,257
Now, if it had been
a rather different proposition,

90
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:51,843
if the idea was to go back

91
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:54,837
and carry on all the jobs we started
on the Discovery expedition...

92
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:58,337
But that is the idea, Bill. That's it.
We'll do better.

93
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:01,302
We'll work on the Barrier,
on the mountains, right up to the Pole.

94
00:10:01,417 --> 00:10:03,294
Ours will be
the best equipped expedition.

95
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:07,918
Dozens of scientists under that most
eminent of all scientists: Dr Wilson.

96
00:10:08,042 --> 00:10:10,636
Yes, that is different!

97
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,343
Come with me, Bill.

98
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:17,836
I couldn't let him go without me,
could I, Oriana?

99
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:25,547
No.

100
00:10:27,792 --> 00:10:29,214
Thank you.

101
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:34,131
Well, I wonder if the motor will start.

102
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:38,050
Yes, I wonder. You can't possibly go
without having something to eat.

103
00:10:38,167 --> 00:10:39,544
No, of course not.

104
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:05,302
That's the fly
you caught the two-pounder on,

105
00:11:05,417 --> 00:11:07,044
in the burn at Clachen.

106
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:09,551
- Remember?
- Yes.

107
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:13,003
It's a long time ago now.

108
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:14,877
Look, the gut's all perished.

109
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,047
So it is.

110
00:11:18,167 --> 00:11:19,635
(Car engine starts up)

111
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,593
Oh, darling!

112
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:22,880
Darling!

113
00:11:33,917 --> 00:11:35,760
- Morning, Teddy.
- Oh, good morning, sir.

114
00:11:37,167 --> 00:11:38,589
What have you got there?

115
00:11:38,708 --> 00:11:41,131
Well, it's a...
It's a sort of cash chart.

116
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,673
That's the target,
there's the date, sir,

117
00:11:43,792 --> 00:11:45,214
and the contributions coming in.

118
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:47,711
Hm. Long way to go yet.

119
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,301
Anything in the post?

120
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,966
Not much money but plenty of people.

121
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:53,505
"Dear and honoured sir,

122
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:56,094
"if I could be allowed
to join your expedition

123
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:58,131
"I would even become
a British subject."

124
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,753
Here's one from a Bluecoat boy.
He says,

125
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:04,924
"It's frightfully cold in my dormitory
so I'm sure I should be all right."

126
00:12:05,042 --> 00:12:07,170
Let him down lightly.
Anything else?

127
00:12:07,292 --> 00:12:09,044
No big cheque, I'm afraid.

128
00:12:09,167 --> 00:12:11,135
Oh, some details
about your lecture tour, sir.

129
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,584
Excuse me, sir.
There's a young lady here about a dog.

130
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:17,255
A dog?

131
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:19,127
Oh, show her in, Caroline.

132
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:23,252
Name, please, Miss?

133
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:24,376
Helen Field.

134
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:26,585
- Chair, Teddy.
- Yes, sir.

135
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:29,835
Please sit down, Miss Field.

136
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:30,959
Thank you.

137
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:34,010
I've brought you the money
for a sledge dog.

138
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:37,299
You said we might.
Anyone, I mean. In your appeal.

139
00:12:37,417 --> 00:12:38,964
How very kind of you, Miss Field.

140
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:41,051
- My name is Scott.
- Yes, I know that.

141
00:12:41,167 --> 00:12:43,340
And this is Lieutenant Evans,
my second in command.

142
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:46,883
I didn't know that.
How are you? I hope you're well.

143
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,209
- How are you, Teddy?
- Oh, very well, thank you, indeed.

144
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:53,257
Look, here's the envelope
with the money from the school.

145
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,376
And...

146
00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:57,544
You know, Miss Field,

147
00:12:57,667 --> 00:13:00,841
when business firms send us cheques,
we're pleased enough,

148
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:03,757
but somehow this means more.

149
00:13:04,542 --> 00:13:06,636
Please thank them tremendously.

150
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:09,003
- Tell me, how many are there?
- 300, nearly.

151
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:10,342
Well, please thank them all.

152
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:13,462
We intend to call the dogs by the names
of any schools that give them.

153
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:16,507
Rugby, Fettes, that sort of thing.
What's the name of your school?

154
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:18,719
South Hampstead
High School for Girls.

155
00:13:20,417 --> 00:13:23,216
Yes. I think we'd better
just call him Hampstead.

156
00:13:24,292 --> 00:13:25,384
(Traffic noise)

157
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:29,710
(Scott) Thank you
for having turned out

158
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:32,336
on such a dirty night
to hear this talk.

159
00:13:33,417 --> 00:13:38,048
During the past few days
I have had the pleasure,

160
00:13:38,167 --> 00:13:41,797
or rather, I should say,
the great pleasure

161
00:13:41,917 --> 00:13:44,966
of addressing meetings like this
all over the country.

162
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:48,595
And knowing, as I do,

163
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:53,509
the rivalry that exists
among our towns and cities

164
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:58,426
I am hoping that,
as the result of this rivalry,

165
00:13:58,542 --> 00:14:02,092
I shall be able to report
to my committee in London

166
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:08,466
that your city has gone one,
if not a great deal, better

167
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:09,880
than your fellow cities.

168
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:12,380
Um, thank you.

169
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:21,756
Well, I'm sure we're all very grateful
to Captain Scott

170
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:26,551
for coming and giving us
this illuminating account of the Antarctic

171
00:14:26,667 --> 00:14:29,295
and I'm sure that if anyone wants
to ask any questions

172
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:33,381
Captain Scott will be only too pleased
to answer them.

173
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,379
Mr Chairman, I'm not averse
to subscribing to anything

174
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,673
that might be in the national interest,

175
00:14:41,792 --> 00:14:43,385
but it does occur to me to ask,

176
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,344
why must this country
send another expedition?

177
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:49,428
What about the Norwegians?
What about Nansen?

178
00:14:49,542 --> 00:14:52,512
Nansen has given up polar exploration.
He's getting on, you know.

179
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,502
What about that other fellow?

180
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:57,424
Amundsen? He's making
for the North Pole, not the South.

181
00:14:57,542 --> 00:14:59,135
What's the difference?

182
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,797
(Laughter)

183
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:06,758
What's the prospect of trade
between this city and the South Pole?

184
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:08,752
Is there any coal down there,

185
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:10,843
anything I can buy or sell?

186
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:12,835
(Laughter)

187
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:17,629
I'm sorry we didn't raise more for you,
but I suppose every penny counts.

188
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,172
Better luck somewhere else.

189
00:15:19,292 --> 00:15:22,341
Are you sure I can't give you a lift?
It's not far out of my way.

190
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:23,880
No, please don't bother.

191
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,503
Well, then, I'll just wish you
a good night and good luck.

192
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:27,717
Thank you. Good night.

193
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:36,425
Captain Scott?

194
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:38,960
Yes?

195
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:40,300
Glad I've caught you.

196
00:15:40,417 --> 00:15:41,714
I've come from India.

197
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:44,211
Want to join your show,
if you'll have me.

198
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:45,550
Good with horses.

199
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:48,552
Do you mean to tell me
you've come 6,000 miles

200
00:15:48,667 --> 00:15:50,886
- to join my expedition?
- Yes. Landed this morning.

201
00:15:52,792 --> 00:15:55,136
- Who are you?
- My name's Oates.

202
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:56,797
- I'm with the Inniskillings.
- Hm.

203
00:15:57,667 --> 00:15:59,465
No sense in getting soaked,
is there?

204
00:16:02,667 --> 00:16:03,668
That's better.

205
00:16:05,167 --> 00:16:06,919
- Cavalryman, eh?
- Yes, sir, dragoons.

206
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,344
- Know anything about the Antarctic?
- Only what I've read.

207
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:14,541
When I saw you were taking ponies,
I thought perhaps I'd come in handy.

208
00:16:15,167 --> 00:16:16,885
- Fit?
- As a fiddle.

209
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,968
- Age?
- 29.

210
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:20,505
- Married?
- No.

211
00:16:21,667 --> 00:16:23,214
- It will be tough.
- I know.

212
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:25,961
- As Hades.
- But not so warm, eh?

213
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,878
But I think we can manage it.

214
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,843
- We?
- That's what I said.

215
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:35,878
- Do you mean you'll take me?
- Glad to.

216
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,594
- You're on the strength.
- I say.

217
00:16:38,708 --> 00:16:40,005
(Tram approaching)

218
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:42,719
- Here's a tram. Come on.
- I say, just a moment.

219
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,252
This any good?

220
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,219
- This is for £1,000.
- Yes. Any good?

221
00:16:54,417 --> 00:16:56,920
(Scott) 'Instead of sitting waiting
for the money to come in,

222
00:16:57,042 --> 00:16:59,761
'I'm taking the opportunity
of trying out my motor sledges.'

223
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:02,505
(Cheering)

224
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:18,006
You see the idea, Dr Nansen?

225
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:20,127
The wheels make their own road
as it goes along.

226
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:23,552
- What do you think of it?
- Yes, what do you think?

227
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:27,086
I'm afraid Dr Nansen
doesn't like motors, dear.

228
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:29,426
<i>That is so.</i>

229
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:31,460
I like dogs.

230
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,256
I can't help feeling that we should use

231
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:35,798
every modern invention
that comes along.

232
00:17:35,917 --> 00:17:37,965
Somebody's got to try these things out.

233
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:41,542
I even thought of taking a wireless
telegraph apparatus, but it's too heavy.

234
00:17:41,667 --> 00:17:45,376
You are right, Captain,
but I like dogs.

235
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,253
Yes, yes,
that's what Amundsen says too.

236
00:17:49,292 --> 00:17:51,465
I've been hearing about his plans
for the North Pole.

237
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:53,836
Amundsen's a pupil of mine,
as you might say,

238
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:55,756
so of course he believes in dogs.

239
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:58,219
Well, perhaps I'm prejudiced,

240
00:17:58,333 --> 00:18:00,381
but I should hate to repeat
the experience I had

241
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,798
on the Discovery expedition.

242
00:18:02,917 --> 00:18:05,841
You see, we look on dogs
rather differently,

243
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:07,210
more as...

244
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:08,835
well, more as friends.

245
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:12,963
Captain, a friend in need
is a friend indeed.

246
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:17,337
This Antarctic of yours
is a cold and cruel place.

247
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:19,843
Even worse than the North.

248
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:23,173
A dog is an animal.

249
00:18:23,292 --> 00:18:26,421
When a dog is finished,
he is still some use to other dogs,

250
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:29,210
and even to man if need be.

251
00:18:31,167 --> 00:18:34,091
That machine of yours,
when it is finished,

252
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:36,256
it's just a heap of metal in the snow.

253
00:18:37,417 --> 00:18:39,670
You cannot eat it.

254
00:18:39,792 --> 00:18:41,294
That's true,

255
00:18:41,417 --> 00:18:43,966
and I am not forgetting
the <i>lessons</i> of the past,

256
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:46,302
but I want to take the new things as well.

257
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:50,126
I shall take dogs, ponies and motors.

258
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:54,588
Well, I would take dogs, dogs and dogs.

259
00:19:00,542 --> 00:19:02,089
Hello, Bill. Morning, Cherry.

260
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:03,425
- Morning.
- Good to see you.

261
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:05,510
- How's Kathleen?
- Splendid. Come along in.

262
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:07,127
- Morning, Atch.
- And the baby?

263
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,672
Peter? Wonderful, bald as a coot.

264
00:19:08,792 --> 00:19:09,793
Morning, sir.

265
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:13,219
I'd know that mug anywhere.
Come out of it, Taff Evans.

266
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,959
I was rather surprised you didn't apply
to come with me again this time, Evans.

267
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:23,677
Didn't have to, sir.
I knew you'd send for me sooner or later.

268
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:27,093
My release is through at last.

269
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:28,835
I'm afraid there's no hurry, Bill.

270
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:30,801
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning, Teddy.

271
00:19:30,917 --> 00:19:32,669
Have a look at that.

272
00:19:32,792 --> 00:19:34,214
At the rate the money's coming in,

273
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:36,506
you could go on
carving up grouse till Christmas.

274
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:38,878
Rather depressing.
Time's getting on.

275
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,923
And none of us are getting any younger.

276
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:46,417
11:30, Bowers? I thought I told you
not to make any more appointments.

277
00:19:46,542 --> 00:19:48,886
He turned up from the Persian Gulf
this morning, sir.

278
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,752
I couldn't say you wouldn't see him.

279
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:54,507
Indian Marine Lieutenant.
Doesn't say how old he is.

280
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:56,047
26, sir.

281
00:19:56,167 --> 00:19:57,589
Today as a matter of fact.

282
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:00,756
- May I come in, sir?
- Well, you are in, aren't you?

283
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:04,587
There's more to come, sir,
with permission.

284
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:06,676
- The door was open, sir.
- True.

285
00:20:06,792 --> 00:20:09,921
I heard my name
and I think I did mention my age, sir.

286
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:11,464
There, sir, 26.

287
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:16,469
Is that real or something
you stuffed inside your coat?

288
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:17,800
Quite real, sir.

289
00:20:19,792 --> 00:20:21,715
Hm. Bill, how's this?

290
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:27,006
Well, I'd rather he hit Teddy than me.

291
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:29,594
- May he hit Teddy?
- Mm, I don't see why not.

292
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:31,961
Excuse me, sir,
but I'm a good deal senior to Bowers.

293
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:33,130
Pity.

294
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,002
- Sit down, Bowers.
- Thank you, sir.

295
00:20:40,917 --> 00:20:42,339
Why do you want to join this show?

296
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:45,541
I suppose you want to be among
the first to reach the Pole. ls that it?

297
00:20:45,667 --> 00:20:47,840
- Out for a bit of white ribbon, eh?
- No, sir.

298
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:52,257
I know it sounds stupid
to say I want adventure, but, er...

299
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:53,797
What do you mean by adventure?

300
00:20:53,917 --> 00:20:56,511
Well, sir, to get some extra knowledge

301
00:20:56,625 --> 00:21:01,176
of the stars and land
and weather and...

302
00:21:01,292 --> 00:21:02,293
And?

303
00:21:03,792 --> 00:21:05,419
Other men's jobs.

304
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:11,838
Well, Bowers, to date
we've had 6,042 applications.

305
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:14,632
I'm afraid I've made up my mind
we can't take anybody else.

306
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,172
(Phone rings)

307
00:21:19,042 --> 00:21:21,670
Hello? Oh, good morning,
Sir Clements.

308
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,251
What?

309
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:27,051
The grant is through.

310
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:28,880
How much?

311
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:32,798
I see. Yes, yes, of course.

312
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,628
Well, thank you very much
for letting us know at once.

313
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,718
Yes. Goodbye, sir.

314
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:41,676
- How much?
- 20,000.

315
00:21:41,792 --> 00:21:45,717
- A lot short of what we wanted.
- Yes, but it makes it just possible.

316
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:47,585
We shall have to cut down a bit,
that's all.

317
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:49,551
- How about my side of things?
- Don't worry.

318
00:21:49,667 --> 00:21:51,135
I won't cut a penny on your side.

319
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:54,629
I promised you the greatest scientific
expedition that ever left England.

320
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:57,511
- How on earth will we do it?
- One ship instead of two. There she is.

321
00:22:00,792 --> 00:22:03,636
We can go, Bill. We're going.
What do you want?

322
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:06,344
Oh, yes, I was just going
to kick you out, wasn't I?

323
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:07,630
- Yes, sir.
- Yes.

324
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:10,424
Well, I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll take you. How's that?

325
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:14,505
- Thank you, sir.
- Right.

326
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:18,048
- Oh, Bowers.
- Yes, sir?

327
00:22:18,792 --> 00:22:21,170
- Many happy returns.
- Thank you very much, sir.

328
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:36,800
(Scott) 'The first leg of our journey,
halfway round the world.'

329
00:22:40,667 --> 00:22:42,385
(Brass band plays)

330
00:23:03,083 --> 00:23:04,175
Cherry.

331
00:23:04,292 --> 00:23:05,714
Just a minute, son. Just a minute.

332
00:23:09,917 --> 00:23:11,214
Excuse me, sir.

333
00:23:11,333 --> 00:23:13,176
Oi, Jehu, stop it!

334
00:23:23,667 --> 00:23:26,591
Could you tell me
where Captain Scott is, please?

335
00:23:26,708 --> 00:23:28,506
(Speaking Russian)

336
00:23:28,625 --> 00:23:30,252
(Whistling)

337
00:23:31,292 --> 00:23:33,545
That's right, sonny.
You come to Uncle.

338
00:23:33,667 --> 00:23:35,669
He's a Russian, he don't understand.

339
00:23:35,792 --> 00:23:37,590
Ah, this is for the owner. Up there.

340
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:39,710
Not on the bridge, on the poop deck.

341
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,922
Telegram, Captain Scott.

342
00:23:45,042 --> 00:23:46,464
Oh? Oh, thank you.

343
00:23:48,042 --> 00:23:48,884
Thanks.

344
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,425
- Any message for Peter?
- Tell him I'll bring him a penguin.

345
00:23:52,542 --> 00:23:53,964
(Ship's horn blows)

346
00:24:02,042 --> 00:24:03,259
Excuse me.

347
00:24:06,625 --> 00:24:07,626
Good bye.

348
00:24:08,875 --> 00:24:10,877
God bless and keep you,
my dearest,

349
00:24:12,208 --> 00:24:13,209
until...

350
00:24:15,625 --> 00:24:18,253
All visitors ashore!
Come along, please!

351
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:20,753
Think of me
when you make those footmarks.

352
00:24:20,875 --> 00:24:22,218
Every step of the way.

353
00:24:22,333 --> 00:24:23,835
(Horn blows again)

354
00:24:33,583 --> 00:24:34,755
(Taff) Up gangway!

355
00:24:34,875 --> 00:24:36,047
(Cheering)

356
00:24:38,583 --> 00:24:39,583
Hold on!

357
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:45,502
All right, carry on.

358
00:24:45,625 --> 00:24:47,627
(Band plays)

359
00:24:55,542 --> 00:24:57,510
(Shouting and cheering)

360
00:25:54,708 --> 00:25:56,836
(Muttering)

361
00:25:59,417 --> 00:26:02,546
This is a bit thick, thousands of miles
from the nearest bookie.

362
00:26:02,667 --> 00:26:04,795
- What's up?
- Red-hot tip for the National.

363
00:26:04,917 --> 00:26:07,215
- Is that a race?
- A race? Why...

364
00:26:07,333 --> 00:26:09,381
Hook, line and sinker!

365
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,548
- Hard luck, Titus.
- Thank you.

366
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,252
The Grouse Commission
are thinking of us.

367
00:26:14,375 --> 00:26:16,343
- Splendid.
- They don't say what, of course.

368
00:26:16,458 --> 00:26:18,210
Here's a good one, sir.

369
00:26:18,333 --> 00:26:21,587
"Love to Hampstead
and kind regards to the rest of you,

370
00:26:21,708 --> 00:26:22,755
"Helen Fields."

371
00:26:23,958 --> 00:26:26,302
Oh, wait a minute.
I've got another one here somewhere.

372
00:26:33,292 --> 00:26:35,545
"I'm going south, Amundsen."

373
00:26:37,542 --> 00:26:39,385
- South?
- But I thought it was understood.

374
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:42,003
- Everyone thought it was understood.
- I can't believe it.

375
00:26:42,875 --> 00:26:44,548
It's perfectly true.
Read it yourself.

376
00:26:49,083 --> 00:26:50,756
From Madeira.
That means he's started.

377
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:52,923
- Why didn't he tell anyone?
- Not very sporting.

378
00:26:53,042 --> 00:26:55,420
(All talk at once)

379
00:26:55,542 --> 00:26:57,044
He's changed his mind.

380
00:26:58,458 --> 00:27:00,210
Anyone's allowed to change his mind.

381
00:27:01,375 --> 00:27:03,798
He was going north,
now he's going south.

382
00:27:05,208 --> 00:27:06,209
That's all.

383
00:27:17,125 --> 00:27:19,628
It means a lot to you, doesn't it,
getting there first?

384
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:21,673
Of course it does.
You know damn well it does.

385
00:27:21,792 --> 00:27:25,626
The Antarctic's a big enough thing to be
up against without this fellow butting in.

386
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:27,969
Why has he suddenly
changed his mind?

387
00:27:28,083 --> 00:27:30,757
He's trying to make a race of it
and we're not rigged for racing.

388
00:27:30,875 --> 00:27:32,969
Quite, Con, quite.

389
00:27:33,083 --> 00:27:35,632
What on earth would you do
with all us scientists?

390
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:37,923
We'd be falling over each other.

391
00:27:40,833 --> 00:27:43,052
You're right, Bill. You're right.

392
00:27:43,167 --> 00:27:45,670
This is a scientific expedition.

393
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:49,501
I am not going to be stampeded
and I am not going to take any risks.

394
00:27:49,625 --> 00:27:51,753
In fact, I'm not going to race.

395
00:27:54,833 --> 00:27:57,256
I wonder what route
the blighter's taking.

396
00:28:07,417 --> 00:28:11,422
'Wonderful to be free at last
from problems so difficult to handle.

397
00:28:12,833 --> 00:28:16,087
'Whatever lies ahead,
I am now on my own ground.'

398
00:29:55,167 --> 00:29:57,420
There you are, sir.
The Great Ice Barrier.

399
00:29:58,458 --> 00:30:00,677
400 miles long and 100 foot high.

400
00:30:26,667 --> 00:30:28,214
'This is obviously the best place,

401
00:30:29,042 --> 00:30:32,216
'a sloping shore
and a good stretch of bay ice.'

402
00:30:41,083 --> 00:30:43,302
Steady, keep her straight on the lines.

403
00:30:53,958 --> 00:30:55,380
Mush! Mush!

404
00:30:59,792 --> 00:31:03,171
'With ponies, motor sledges,
dogs and men parties,

405
00:31:03,292 --> 00:31:05,920
'we've done an excellent job
of transporting.

406
00:31:06,042 --> 00:31:08,761
'Bowers proves a perfect treasure.

407
00:31:08,875 --> 00:31:11,003
'There's not a single case
he doesn't know

408
00:31:11,125 --> 00:31:13,378
'or a single article
which he cannot find at once.

409
00:31:14,333 --> 00:31:19,339
'So, we are landed and the hut is up
eight days after our arrival.

410
00:31:19,458 --> 00:31:21,301
'A very good record.'

411
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,592
Sir.

412
00:31:25,958 --> 00:31:28,006
- What is it, McKenzie?
- Beg pardon, sir.

413
00:31:28,125 --> 00:31:30,844
We were wondering if you'd take
old puss with you to the Pole, sir.

414
00:31:30,958 --> 00:31:33,006
- Sure to show up well against the snow.
- Yes, sir.

415
00:31:33,125 --> 00:31:34,251
Hear, hear, sir.

416
00:31:34,375 --> 00:31:36,343
He'd show up well anywhere.

417
00:31:36,458 --> 00:31:38,881
No, no, it's very good
of you fellows to suggest it,

418
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,879
but I mustn't take the luck
from the ship.

419
00:31:43,375 --> 00:31:45,127
- Great minds think alike, eh?
- Yes, sir.

420
00:31:47,875 --> 00:31:49,468
- Goodbye, Pennell.
- Goodbye, sir.

421
00:31:49,583 --> 00:31:51,143
- Best of luck to you all.
- And to you.

422
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:54,629
Thanks. See you in about...
well, a year's time.

423
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:55,751
Yes, sir.

424
00:31:56,958 --> 00:31:59,177
'The ship will drop Campbell's party
up the coast

425
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:01,135
'on her way back to New Zealand.

426
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,459
'What news shall we have for her
when she returns next summer, I wonder.

427
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:16,719
'There is much for us all to do
while the daylight lasts.

428
00:32:16,833 --> 00:32:20,292
'When the sun does go,
we shan't see him for half a year.'

429
00:32:26,292 --> 00:32:27,965
Oi, oi, oi!

430
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,001
Hello.

431
00:32:59,917 --> 00:33:01,464
Oi, don't go away.

432
00:33:02,125 --> 00:33:04,469
Come back.
There's nothing to worry about.

433
00:33:16,542 --> 00:33:19,421
Well, the winter's almost on us now,

434
00:33:19,542 --> 00:33:22,512
and that means sitting tight here
for the next six months.

435
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:25,469
Seems a good moment to run over
what's ahead when the sun comes back.

436
00:33:26,792 --> 00:33:30,501
This chart makes things pretty easy
to understand, I think.

437
00:33:30,625 --> 00:33:33,595
- Can you see all right at the back?
- Yes, thank you, sir.

438
00:33:33,708 --> 00:33:35,710
We're here, just above the sea ice.

439
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:39,469
The first stage is the Great Ice Barrier.

440
00:33:39,583 --> 00:33:42,211
About 400 miles to cross.

441
00:33:42,333 --> 00:33:45,337
Then come mountains 9,000 feet high.

442
00:33:45,458 --> 00:33:48,462
We get up them
by the Beardmore Glacier.

443
00:33:48,583 --> 00:33:50,677
There's over 100 miles of that.

444
00:33:50,792 --> 00:33:52,760
Lastly, the plateau.

445
00:33:53,542 --> 00:33:57,001
Another 350 miles along that
to the Pole.

446
00:34:00,042 --> 00:34:01,589
Now, about ways and means.

447
00:34:02,458 --> 00:34:05,758
The secret of travel in the Antarctic
is food and fuel.

448
00:34:05,875 --> 00:34:08,594
Hot food will take a man further
than cold food.

449
00:34:08,708 --> 00:34:12,008
And remember, there's no such thing
as living off the country.

450
00:34:12,125 --> 00:34:14,048
Every ounce will have to be carried

451
00:34:14,167 --> 00:34:17,967
and depot'd all the way along the route
to supply us on the way home.

452
00:34:18,083 --> 00:34:20,131
Give me a hand
with the other one, Bill, will you?

453
00:34:27,625 --> 00:34:29,298
Now, you see these depots
marked here?

454
00:34:30,125 --> 00:34:32,173
Up to the last, One Ton.

455
00:34:32,292 --> 00:34:34,010
These are the ones
we put down this summer

456
00:34:34,125 --> 00:34:36,594
in order to save weight next summer.

457
00:34:36,708 --> 00:34:39,302
Beyond, on the outward journey,

458
00:34:39,417 --> 00:34:42,967
the southern party will put down
more depots every so often.

459
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,049
The whole resources of the entire party

460
00:34:47,167 --> 00:34:50,421
will be devoted to getting four men

461
00:34:50,542 --> 00:34:55,218
into a position from which they can
make their final bid for the Pole.

462
00:34:56,917 --> 00:34:59,215
Outward to the foot of the glacier,

463
00:34:59,333 --> 00:35:03,383
tractors, ponies and dogs will haul
as much as they can as far as they can.

464
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,753
From then on, we'll ask no more
of machines and animals.

465
00:35:05,875 --> 00:35:07,718
It'll be up to us.

466
00:35:07,833 --> 00:35:10,586
From the glacier to the Pole
and all the way back, man-hauling.

467
00:35:12,042 --> 00:35:14,261
Now, the time margin is very small.

468
00:35:15,542 --> 00:35:19,376
We've found already that our ponies
can't stand the lowest temperatures.

469
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:22,424
So it will mean starting
later than I'd hoped.

470
00:35:22,542 --> 00:35:24,840
And we shall have to move
faster than Shackleton did

471
00:35:24,958 --> 00:35:27,632
to have any chance of reaching
the Pole and getting back.

472
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,093
Getting back, mark you,

473
00:35:29,208 --> 00:35:31,586
before the darkness
and winter blizzards set in again.

474
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:35,218
Now, is that all clear?
Any questions?

475
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:37,006
(Muttering)

476
00:35:39,417 --> 00:35:42,626
- I know one I'd like to ask him.
- Which four, eh?

477
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:45,219
(Ship's horn blows)

478
00:35:46,625 --> 00:35:48,468
It's the ship. She's back.

479
00:36:10,708 --> 00:36:13,086
- What's the trouble, Pennell?
- Came across Amundsen.

480
00:36:13,208 --> 00:36:14,630
- Where?
- Bay of Whales.

481
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:16,468
The Bay of Whales, eh?

482
00:36:16,583 --> 00:36:19,837
400 miles away.
That's practically next door out here.

483
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:23,754
- How many men has he got with him?
- Only 19 all told, sir.

484
00:36:23,875 --> 00:36:26,094
He has more than 100 dogs.
Never seen so many dogs.

485
00:36:26,208 --> 00:36:28,961
He's got some cheek.
We found this place first.

486
00:36:29,083 --> 00:36:32,007
Fellow has a million miles of ice
to choose from and he has to pick ours.

487
00:36:32,125 --> 00:36:34,219
Ah, well, the Antarctic's big enough.

488
00:36:35,333 --> 00:36:37,552
Right, Pennell.
Thanks for the news.

489
00:36:38,292 --> 00:36:41,262
Now, you'd better get out again
before the sea freezes over.

490
00:36:41,375 --> 00:36:43,548
I shall be glad
when we've finished with the Pole

491
00:36:43,667 --> 00:36:46,466
and we can get down
to some real work, won't you, Bill?

492
00:37:20,042 --> 00:37:21,840
(Wind howling)

493
00:37:23,333 --> 00:37:26,382
- Hot char anywhere?
- Oh, shut that door, Birdie!

494
00:37:35,583 --> 00:37:37,210
(Dogs yelping)

495
00:37:42,417 --> 00:37:45,091
- Giving tongue all right, aren't they?
- Mm.

496
00:37:45,208 --> 00:37:47,552
Well, good night, all.

497
00:37:47,667 --> 00:37:48,793
Good night, Ponko.

498
00:37:48,917 --> 00:37:50,510
Brrrr!

499
00:38:03,875 --> 00:38:05,548
Good night, Uncle Bill.

500
00:38:05,667 --> 00:38:06,759
Good night, Atch.

534
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:41,627
All right, then.

535
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:45,300

The Sleeping Bag, a poem.

537
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:49,002
Hurray!

538
00:41:49,125 --> 00:41:51,219
On the outside grows the fur side

539
00:41:51,333 --> 00:41:53,176
On the inside grows the skin side

540
00:41:53,292 --> 00:41:56,375
So the fur side is the outside
and the skin side is the inside

541
00:41:57,292 --> 00:42:01,297
One side likes the skin side inside
and the fur side on the outside

542
00:42:01,417 --> 00:42:04,921
Others like the skin side outside
and the fur side on the inside

543
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:09,584
If you turn the skin side outside,
thinking you will side with that side

544
00:42:09,708 --> 00:42:13,417
Then the soft side, fur side's inside,
which, some argue, is the wrong side

545
00:42:15,042 --> 00:42:18,672
If you turn the fur side outside
as you say it grows on that side

546
00:42:18,792 --> 00:42:22,467
Then your outside's next to the skin side
which for comfort's not the right side

547
00:42:23,292 --> 00:42:27,092
For the skin side is the cold side
and your outside's not your warm side

548
00:42:27,208 --> 00:42:30,712
And two cold sides side by side
are not right sides, one side decides

549
00:42:32,333 --> 00:42:36,543
If you decide to side with that side,
turn the top side fur side inside

550
00:42:36,667 --> 00:42:40,547
Then the cold side, hard side, skin side
is beyond all question inside out

571
00:44:03,167 --> 00:44:05,386
can he do it, do you think,
just with dogs?

572
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:08,968
Can't say, Soldier, can't say.

573
00:44:10,667 --> 00:44:13,295
These Norwegians are better
with dogs than we are and...

574

our using these chaps
means making a later start.

575
00:44:18,417 --> 00:44:21,136
His base is 80 miles nearer the Pole,

576
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:24,003
but he'll be crossing unknown country.

577
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:28,800
Seems to me it all depends on whether
he finds another way up to the plateau.

578
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:31,627
It's just a matter of luck.

579

684
00:55:07,333 --> 00:55:09,210
- Dimitri?
- Sir?

685
00:55:09,333 --> 00:55:10,676
Here's the mail.

686
00:55:10,792 --> 00:55:12,339
Goodbye and good luck.

687
00:55:12,458 --> 00:55:13,505
Goodbye, sir.

688
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:15,501
Good luck.

689
00:55:15,667 --> 00:55:17,465
- Goodbye, Dimitri.
- Goodbye, Ruski.

690
00:55:17,583 --> 00:55:19,677
- (Scott) Good luck, boy.
- Dos vedanya/

691
00:55:20,625 --> 00:55:21,751
Mush! Mush!

692
00:55:22,417 --> 00:55:23,634
(Shouts order in Russian)

693
00:55:25,667 --> 00:55:27,510
Well, goodbye, Meares.
Have a good run home.

694
00:55:27,667 --> 00:55:29,510
Thank you, sir,
and the best of luck to you.

695
00:55:29,625 --> 00:55:30,626
Thanks.

696
00:55:31,292 --> 00:55:33,420
Mush!

697
00:55:35,333 --> 00:55:36,334
(Taff) Goodbye, sir.

698
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:37,926
(Oates) Goodbye, Mother Meares.

699
00:55:53,708 --> 00:55:57,633
'12 men with three sledges,
man-hauling.'

700
00:57:11,333 --> 00:57:13,961
Brandy, Uncle Bill?
What's this for?

701
00:57:14,083 --> 00:57:17,417
The use of that, my dear Titus,
is purely medicinal.

702
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:18,843
Kindly hand it to me.

703
00:57:20,875 --> 00:57:23,424
'We've climbed 4,000 feet.

704
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:27,050
'We've been toiling for five days
but are barely halfway up.

705
00:57:28,167 --> 00:57:30,920
'Surely we were right
not to bring the dogs on.'

706
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:31,501
Halt.

707
00:58:39,417 --> 00:58:40,418
That way.

708
00:58:41,375 --> 00:58:43,218
Aye, aye, sir.

709
00:58:43,333 --> 00:58:45,176
Ready? Heave.

710
00:58:50,167 --> 00:58:51,168
Ready?

711
00:58:52,208 --> 00:58:53,209
Heave.

712
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:35,877
Birdie?

713
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,719
Better leave a flag here.
Seems to be a good way up.

714
00:59:38,833 --> 00:59:40,130
Aye, aye, sir.

715
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:23,002
(Scott) See that nunatak?

716
01:00:23,125 --> 01:00:25,127
That's what Shackleton called
Buckley Island.

717
01:00:25,250 --> 01:00:26,797
(Teddy) Top of the glacier, sir?

718
01:00:26,917 --> 01:00:29,921
(Scott) Yes, that's right.
Our last big climb.

719
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:33,879
At this rate, sir, we should be at the top
in time for our Christmas dinner.

720
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,503
That's right, Lashly.
Merry Christmas is the word.

721
01:00:41,167 --> 01:00:44,592
(Teddy) Take the strain, Crean.
Toss him a line, Birdie.

722
01:00:54,958 --> 01:00:57,507
- You all right, Lashly?
- Yes, sir.

723
01:00:57,625 --> 01:01:00,174
Sure to be.
It's my birthday too.

724
01:01:01,167 --> 01:01:03,044
Many happy returns, Lashly.

725
01:01:03,167 --> 01:01:05,135
Right, Birdie.

726
01:01:05,250 --> 01:01:06,797
Right, Crean. Bowline.

727
01:01:08,125 --> 01:01:09,126
Heave.

728
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:11,750
Bowline.

729
01:01:15,292 --> 01:01:16,714
Taff, caramel?

730
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:18,501
Thank you, sir.

731
01:01:18,667 --> 01:01:20,010
- Con?
- Thank you, Bill.

732
01:01:23,167 --> 01:01:24,510
- Atch?
- Thank you, Uncle Bill.

733
01:01:26,833 --> 01:01:28,380
Soldier, you're a marvel.

734
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:30,298
Well, Christmas comes
but once a year.

735
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:33,127
Christmas comes and Atch goes, eh?

736
01:01:33,250 --> 01:01:34,297
Yes, worst luck.

737
01:01:38,250 --> 01:01:39,251
Thank you.

738
01:01:41,583 --> 01:01:44,462
Pemmican and pony?
How do you do it, Titus?

739
01:01:45,292 --> 01:01:48,262
Perfectly simple.
Been giving you short rations all week.

740
01:01:48,375 --> 01:01:50,218
Oh!

741
01:01:50,333 --> 01:01:52,427
- (Scott) Well, it was worth it.
- Thank you, sir.

742
01:01:55,375 --> 01:01:56,797
Atch.

743
01:01:56,917 --> 01:01:58,590
Yes?

744
01:01:58,708 --> 01:02:00,676
What do you have to have
to be given brandy?

745
01:02:01,792 --> 01:02:02,793
Leprosy.-

746
01:02:03,333 --> 01:02:04,380
Plague.

747
01:02:05,208 --> 01:02:06,630
Or just an ordinary fit.

748
01:02:07,833 --> 01:02:09,426
- Fit, eh?
- Hm.

749
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:11,673
- Er, more, sir?
- Oh, thanks.

750
01:02:11,792 --> 01:02:15,092
- Oh, sorry, sir.
- That's all right, Atch.

751
01:02:15,208 --> 01:02:18,337
We are a bit crowded in here tonight.
We ought to eat by numbers.

752
01:02:18,458 --> 01:02:21,632
- Don't put too much faith in numbers.
- Carry on, Evans.

753
01:02:21,750 --> 01:02:25,630
- Story coming.
- Well, hardly a story exactly, sir.

754
01:02:25,750 --> 01:02:28,094
But I remember
when we was at Whale Island,

755
01:02:28,208 --> 01:02:30,427
we had a PO gunnery instructor.

756
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:33,344
He was on one of them guns
with the new-fangled breech action.

757
01:02:33,458 --> 01:02:35,335
Good, but tricky.

758
01:02:35,458 --> 01:02:38,086
You had to press the button
near the breech with your left thumb

759
01:02:38,208 --> 01:02:40,506
and then whang in the block
with your right hand.

760
01:02:40,625 --> 01:02:42,719
Trouble was,
some on the course gets so excited,

761
01:02:42,833 --> 01:02:44,927
they gets the movements
too close together.

762
01:02:45,042 --> 01:02:47,886
In goes the block
and off comes the top of their thumb.

763
01:02:48,875 --> 01:02:51,424
This PO gets tired of seeing
a lot of people wandering about

764
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:54,504
with no tops to their thumbs
and he calls the class together

765
01:02:54,625 --> 01:02:56,923
and he says, "Now, listen,
you flat-footed soldiers.

766
01:02:57,042 --> 01:02:59,010
"Let's have no more of this.

767
01:02:59,833 --> 01:03:03,258
"I'll demonstrate the drill
to you slowly, by numbers.

768
01:03:03,375 --> 01:03:05,503
"One, I opens the breech.

769
01:03:05,667 --> 01:03:07,715
"Two, I presses the button
with my left thumb.

770
01:03:08,750 --> 01:03:11,469
"And three, I sends home the block
with my right hand.

771
01:03:13,250 --> 01:03:16,504
"And that's how you lose the top
of your bloody thumb."

772
01:03:16,625 --> 01:03:18,923
(Groaning)

773
01:03:19,042 --> 01:03:20,635
Keep back! Keep back!

774
01:03:20,750 --> 01:03:22,377
Oh! Brandy!

775
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:23,877
Brandy! Brandy!

776
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,253
- That's out of date, Titus.
- Brandy.

777
01:03:26,375 --> 01:03:27,843
This is the modern treatment.

778
01:03:27,958 --> 01:03:30,336
No, Uncle Bill!
Uncle Bill, stop it!

779
01:03:30,458 --> 01:03:31,960
No, stop it!

780
01:03:32,083 --> 01:03:33,084
No!

781
01:03:51,667 --> 01:03:54,011
'9,000 feet up,

782
01:03:54,125 --> 01:03:56,127
'the Barrier and the glacier behind us.

783
01:03:57,042 --> 01:04:00,751
'It should be level-going now,
all the way to our goal.'

784
01:04:13,583 --> 01:04:15,085
- Goodbye, Atch.
- Goodbye, sir.

785
01:04:15,208 --> 01:04:17,631
- Look out for us in March.
- Right.

786
01:04:17,750 --> 01:04:20,003
With any luck, we'll be back
before the ship has to go.

787
01:04:21,667 --> 01:04:24,750
- I hope I haven't disappointed you.
- No, no, Cherry.

788
01:04:24,875 --> 01:04:27,503
It was a sheer toss-up
whether you or Titus went on from here.

789
01:04:28,458 --> 01:04:29,675
- Was it really?
- Mm.

790
01:04:30,875 --> 01:04:34,084
- Who's going to go on the last lap?
- I don't suppose it's settled yet.

791
01:04:34,208 --> 01:04:36,882
Four out of the eight of us.
We're all hoping.

792
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,297
(Scott) Ready?

793
01:04:38,417 --> 01:04:39,760
Heave.

794
01:04:39,875 --> 01:04:41,798
- Goodbye, boys.
- Goodbye, Ted.

795
01:04:41,917 --> 01:04:43,760
- Goodbye, boys.
- Goodbye, you fellows.

796
01:04:43,875 --> 01:04:45,502
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Atch.

797
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:12,460
'Eight men with two sledges,
man-hauling.'

798
01:05:14,458 --> 01:05:17,257
- This wind!
- Help us on the way back, though.

799
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:44,343
Hardest decision of the lot, Bill.

800
01:05:45,333 --> 01:05:47,085
And the one where you can't help me.

801
01:05:58,333 --> 01:06:00,756
Can we depot our skis here, sir?

802
01:06:00,875 --> 01:06:02,923
Help lighten our sledge.

803
01:06:03,042 --> 01:06:04,419
Yes, all right.

804
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:06,093
Leave your lot here.

805
01:06:06,208 --> 01:06:07,960
The return party can pick them up.

806
01:06:08,833 --> 01:06:10,176
Whoever they are.

807
01:06:10,958 --> 01:06:13,802
We'll make our lunch camp here,
let you get ahead a bit.

808

'Is my team the best?

809
01:06:40,875 --> 01:06:41,967

'What about Teddy's?'

817

Halt.

818
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:10,126
Carry on, Bill.

819
01:07:14,417 --> 01:07:16,044
Ready?

820
01:07:16,167 --> 01:07:17,168
Heave.

Last letters home go tomorrow.

828
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:20,093
You're too big, both of you.

829
01:08:21,167 --> 01:08:25,673
What the Captain wants
is a middler, about 5' 8".

830
01:08:25,792 --> 01:08:27,840
- And what might you be'?
- 5' 8".

831
01:08:30,042 --> 01:08:31,042
Oh!

832
01:08:32,583 --> 01:08:34,005
Here comes the Captain.

833
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,843
Well done, lads. First-class job.

834
01:08:45,042 --> 01:08:46,339
Lashly, Crean.

835
01:08:47,875 --> 01:08:50,924
It's only fair to tell you now
that you'll not be coming on with us.

836
01:08:51,875 --> 01:08:53,092
I'm very sorry indeed.

837
01:08:54,125 --> 01:08:56,719
You've done splendidly
and I shall never forget it.

838
01:08:56,833 --> 01:08:58,710
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

839
01:08:59,708 --> 01:09:00,709
And me, sir?

840
01:09:02,042 --> 01:09:04,795
- You'll be coming on.
- Thank you, sir.

841
01:09:06,625 --> 01:09:07,717
Good for you, Taff.

842
01:09:09,208 --> 01:09:11,961
You're a lucky devil, Taff.
You always were.

843
01:09:13,333 --> 01:09:14,334
(Scott) Teddy?

844
01:09:17,083 --> 01:09:18,084
Yes, sir?

845
01:09:21,083 --> 01:09:22,209
About tomorrow.

846
01:09:24,083 --> 01:09:25,926
I've given a lot of thought to the matter,

847
01:09:27,292 --> 01:09:29,215
and I've decided
that my four should go on.

848
01:09:32,667 --> 01:09:33,668
I see, sir.

849
01:09:35,667 --> 01:09:37,089
There's one other thing.

850
01:09:38,292 --> 01:09:39,760
I want to take Bowers.

851
01:09:41,042 --> 01:09:42,510
If you can spare him.

852
01:09:42,625 --> 01:09:44,093
- Five, sir?
- Yes.

853
01:09:47,833 --> 01:09:49,085
Right.

854
01:09:51,333 --> 01:09:52,755
And, Teddy?

855
01:09:54,792 --> 01:09:55,918
<i>Sorry.-</i>

856
01:09:57,583 --> 01:09:59,005
Thank you, sir.

857
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:20,127
I'm taking five, Bill.

858
01:10:21,625 --> 01:10:23,423
- Five?
- Yes, you, me, Bowers, Oates

859
01:10:23,500 --> 01:10:25,628
and Taff Evans
as the strongest and biggest.

860
01:10:26,625 --> 01:10:28,627
A scientist, two sailors and a soldier.

861
01:10:28,750 --> 01:10:30,798
What better companions
could a man have, eh?

862
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,877
'Dear Kathleen,

863
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,844
'a last note from a hopeful position.

864
01:10:39,875 --> 01:10:42,469
'I think it's going to be all right.'

865
01:10:43,292 --> 01:10:45,511
- Goodbye, Crean.
- Goodbye, Lashly. Best of luck.

866
01:10:45,625 --> 01:10:47,093
- Goodbye, Lashly.
- Goodbye, sir.

867
01:10:47,208 --> 01:10:49,836
Well, Teddy, we couldn't
have got this far without you.

868
01:10:49,958 --> 01:10:51,505
Thank you, sir, and good luck.

869
01:10:51,625 --> 01:10:53,252
Thanks. See you
sometime in March, eh?

870
01:10:56,708 --> 01:10:57,755
Ready?

871
01:10:58,958 --> 01:10:59,959
Heave.

872
01:11:01,042 --> 01:11:02,840
Let's give them a cheer, lads.

873
01:11:02,958 --> 01:11:04,801
- Hurray!
- Hurray!

874
01:11:04,917 --> 01:11:08,876
(All cheer)

875
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:05,834
'Five men with one sledge,

876
01:12:05,958 --> 01:12:07,631

'Bowers on foot

'but he's an undefeated little sportsman.'

881
01:12:30,625 --> 01:12:32,798
- Not ready yet, Titus?
- No, not yet.

882
01:12:33,833 --> 01:12:35,426
Latitude 88:25, sir.

883
01:12:38,125 --> 01:12:40,093
- Farthest south, eh?
- (Oates) Good-oh.

884
01:12:41,625 --> 01:12:44,424
- Beyond Shackleton at last.
- That's great, sir.

885
01:12:56,708 --> 01:12:58,426
Something the matter with your hand?

886
01:12:58,500 --> 01:13:00,628
Only a cut, sir. It's nothing.

887
01:13:01,583 --> 01:13:03,506
I heals easy.

888
01:13:03,625 --> 01:13:05,343
At least, I do at home.

'Cooking for five takes a seriously
longer time than cooking for four.

when reorganizing.'

'Can we keep up these marches?

01:13:40,375 --> 01:13:41,797
'It's a critical time.

'But we ought to do the trick.'

How far now, sir?

895
01:13:49,917 --> 01:13:53,126
About 27 miles, two good marches.

896
01:14:03,875 --> 01:14:06,424
I'm sorry but my sleeping bag
is not on the sledge.

897
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:07,843
Halt.

898
01:14:17,208 --> 01:14:20,087
It can't have fallen further back
than our last halt.

899
01:14:20,208 --> 01:14:21,630
May I go, sir?

900
01:14:24,958 --> 01:14:26,380
I'm coming with you.

901
01:14:38,458 --> 01:14:40,335
Can't trust myself to speak, sir.

902
01:14:40,458 --> 01:14:41,880
Well, don't, then, Taff.

903
01:14:44,667 --> 01:14:46,965
'We only had to go back
a couple of miles,

904

01:15:06,875 --> 01:15:09,298
Can't be more than five miles now, sir.

Sir.

907
01:15:24,333 --> 01:15:25,334
There.

908
01:16:00,417 --> 01:16:01,794
Amundsen.

909
01:16:46,042 --> 01:16:47,385
Look.

910
01:17:06,333 --> 01:17:08,677
Well, I suppose it was meant to be.

911
01:17:09,792 --> 01:17:13,296
They've left their names.
There were five of them, apparently.

912
01:17:13,417 --> 01:17:15,294
And there's a letter
for the King of Norway

913
01:17:15,417 --> 01:17:19,092
with a note asking Captain Scott
to be so kind as to deliver it.

914
01:17:21,833 --> 01:17:23,676
He's forgotten to stamp it.

915
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:30,673
Birdie, you'd better check the position.

916
01:17:35,250 --> 01:17:36,923

917
01:17:37,042 --> 01:17:40,421

circumstances from those expected.

in the air which chills one to the bone.

924

01:18:38,250 --> 01:18:40,969
Cherry asked me
to give you this at the Pole.

928
01:18:41,083 --> 01:18:42,710
Well done that man.

929
01:18:46,292 --> 01:18:47,965
Sorry you chaps don't like chocolate.

930
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,253
- Soldier.
- Thank you, sir.

931
01:18:55,375 --> 01:18:56,422
- Bill.
- Thank you.

932
01:18:59,875 --> 01:19:01,218
- Mmm
- Thank you, sir.

933
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:06,298
- Evans.
- Thank you, sir.

934
01:19:08,333 --> 01:19:10,131
That hand still bothering you?

935
01:19:10,250 --> 01:19:11,627
Hardly at all now, sir.

936
01:19:13,208 --> 01:19:15,631
Well, lads, only 900 miles to go.

937
01:19:24,958 --> 01:19:25,959
Ready?

938
01:19:26,625 --> 01:19:27,842
Heave.

939
01:20:07,208 --> 01:20:08,585
Ready?

940
01:20:08,708 --> 01:20:09,925
Heave.

941
01:20:15,500 --> 01:20:16,843
This is better, eh?

942
01:20:18,250 --> 01:20:19,502
Birdie?

943
01:20:19,667 --> 01:20:22,090
Your skis must be
round here somewhere.

944
01:20:22,208 --> 01:20:24,381
- Keep an eye open for them.
- Aye, aye, sir.

945
01:20:44,583 --> 01:20:47,336
'The wind is playing strange tricks.

946
01:20:47,458 --> 01:20:51,213
'Instead of blowing steadily northward,
as it did when we came,

the full weight of the sledge.'

951
01:21:24,208 --> 01:21:27,087
- You know where Teddy turned back.
- Yes. What about it?

01:21:27,208 --> 01:21:28,630
According to that note of his,

953
01:21:28,750 --> 01:21:30,969
we've done the same distance
half a day better.

954
01:21:31,083 --> 01:21:34,713
Half a day. Do you hear that, Soldier?
We're half a day better than Teddy.

955
01:21:34,833 --> 01:21:36,380
Good-oh!

956
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:38,502
A day's march nearer home, Birdie.

957
01:21:38,667 --> 01:21:40,465
A day's march nearer steaks.

958
01:21:42,375 --> 01:21:46,084
Large, thick, juicy, sizzly ones.

959
01:21:46,208 --> 01:21:48,210
Oh, don't.

960
01:21:48,333 --> 01:21:50,301
With mushrooms.

961
01:21:50,417 --> 01:21:52,044
And beer.

962
01:21:52,167 --> 01:21:53,384
And beer?

963
01:21:53,500 --> 01:21:55,594
Beer of course, gallons of it.

964
01:21:57,042 --> 01:21:59,841
Had an awful nightmare
the other night, Birdie.

965
01:21:59,958 --> 01:22:02,006
Dreamt that Simpson's
had been burnt down.

966
01:22:03,750 --> 01:22:05,969
(Bowers) Hello, Bill.
What have you got this time?

967
01:22:10,583 --> 01:22:12,881
Quite an interesting day.

968
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,469
This hoosh smells good.
Yours, Con?

969
01:22:15,583 --> 01:22:18,336
Birdie reckons we've done
half a day's better time than Teddy did.

970
01:22:18,458 --> 01:22:19,880
Good, good.

971
01:22:21,250 --> 01:22:22,752
What are these, Bill?

972
01:22:22,875 --> 01:22:25,469
Sea plants mostly,
and some tree fossils.

973
01:22:25,583 --> 01:22:29,713
Good heavens. This must have been
quite a warm spot once upon a time.

974
01:22:30,375 --> 01:22:31,843
And look at this.

975
01:22:33,458 --> 01:22:34,801
Coal, by Jove.

976
01:22:36,792 --> 01:22:40,672
"What's the prospect of trade
between this city and the Antarctic?"

977
01:22:44,458 --> 01:22:46,131
Coal, Evans. Catch.

978
01:22:46,250 --> 01:22:47,297
Ooh!

979
01:22:48,833 --> 01:22:51,302
- What's the matter, man?
- It's nothing, sir.

980
01:22:51,417 --> 01:22:54,341
Quite all right.
Only a bit awkward, that's all.

981
01:23:23,833 --> 01:23:27,212
'I am indeed glad to think
that we've done with the plateau.

982
01:23:27,333 --> 01:23:30,667
'Another week of those conditions might
have had a very bad effect on Evans.'

983
01:24:13,458 --> 01:24:14,835
See your flag anywhere, Birdie?

984
01:24:16,708 --> 01:24:17,755
No sign of it, sir.

985
01:24:18,792 --> 01:24:20,635
We'll try a bit back and to the right.

986
01:24:31,583 --> 01:24:36,293
Evans, off with your harness.
Take the aft end of the sledge.

987
01:24:37,458 --> 01:24:38,801
Understand?

988
01:24:38,917 --> 01:24:39,918
Aye, aye, sir.

989
01:24:48,667 --> 01:24:51,170
'There is no doubt

more than we do.'

992
01:25:14,667 --> 01:25:15,919
Look out, steady!

01:25:16,042 --> 01:25:17,134
(Shouting)

994
01:25:51,042 --> 01:25:53,261
There it is, sir. There's the flag.

995
01:25:57,708 --> 01:25:58,709
A shadow.

996
01:26:29,083 --> 01:26:32,053
'Evans keeps saying,
as he would, that he's quite well.

999
01:26:58,375 --> 01:26:59,376
Halt.

1000
01:27:02,417 --> 01:27:04,260
Can't be far now.

1001
01:27:04,375 --> 01:27:07,834
Birdie, try up that hill.
See if you can see the cairn.

1002
01:27:07,958 --> 01:27:08,959
Right, sir.

1003
01:27:16,125 --> 01:27:17,718
What's wrong, Evans?

1004
01:27:17,833 --> 01:27:20,211
It's loose, sir.
It's come loose, sir.

1005
01:27:20,333 --> 01:27:22,085
Have it right in a moment.

1006
01:27:22,208 --> 01:27:26,008
Hold on. I'll do it.
You get your harness off.

1007
01:27:27,917 --> 01:27:29,965
It's only my old hand, sir.

1008
01:27:30,083 --> 01:27:31,551
Makes me a bit slow.

1009
01:27:32,875 --> 01:27:36,334
I can't see the cairn,
but I can see the Barrier.

1010
01:27:38,875 --> 01:27:39,875
How's that?

1011
01:27:40,958 --> 01:27:42,380
Try and move your foot.

1012
01:27:49,083 --> 01:27:52,417
- Sure you can manage?
- I'll be fine, sir.

1013
01:27:56,042 --> 01:27:59,376
That's the man, Taff.
Take your time.

1014
01:27:59,500 --> 01:28:00,922
We'll be camping soon.

1015
01:28:09,458 --> 01:28:11,085
Ready? Heave.

1016
01:29:10,083 --> 01:29:11,084
Halt.

1017
01:29:38,500 --> 01:29:40,298
What is it, Taff?

1018
01:29:42,458 --> 01:29:44,927
I'm all right, sir, quite well.

1019
01:29:51,542 --> 01:29:52,543
Taff?

1020

We've got to do more miles a day, Bill.

1026
01:30:41,417 --> 01:30:43,294
We ought to find it warmer
down here, anyhow.

1027

Sir.

1028
01:30:50,792 --> 01:30:52,385
60 degrees of frost.

01:31:07,417 --> 01:31:08,418
Ready?

1033
01:31:14,500 --> 01:31:17,629
No, no, no.
Tortoise beat the hare in the end.

1034
01:31:25,667 --> 01:31:26,668
Right, Soldier?

1035
01:31:28,417 --> 01:31:29,418
Ready, sir.

1036
01:31:31,167 --> 01:31:32,714
Heave.

1037
01:31:32,833 --> 01:31:36,042
'There is no getting away from the fact
that we are not going strong.

1038
01:31:37,500 --> 01:31:39,548
'And I'm afraid Soldier's foot is bad.'

1039
01:31:57,958 --> 01:31:59,926
When I get home,

1040
01:32:00,042 --> 01:32:02,010
I'm never going to walk another step.

1041
01:32:02,792 --> 01:32:05,045
- Ride wherever I go.
- Even in London?

1042
01:32:06,542 --> 01:32:07,634
London.

1043
01:32:09,250 --> 01:32:12,629
- Know the Empire promenade, Birdie?
- Funny thing, I've never been.

1044
01:32:13,750 --> 01:32:16,094
First night home, I'll be there.

1045
01:32:16,208 --> 01:32:18,302
You must take me with you, Titus.

1046
01:32:18,417 --> 01:32:20,886
But you'll have
to leave your horse outside.

1047
01:32:23,250 --> 01:32:26,094
I ought to tell you that
we haven't too much fuel in hand.

1048
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,469
If we're still short at Mount Hooper,

1049
01:32:31,542 --> 01:32:33,385
we'll try going on cold meals.

1050
01:32:33,500 --> 01:32:34,922
We may have no choice.

1051
01:32:35,500 --> 01:32:37,047
(Oates groans)

1052
01:32:49,917 --> 01:32:53,876
Funny, used to have
what they call a good leg for a boot.

1053
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:56,673
Wouldn't think it now, would you, Bill?

1054
01:32:58,708 --> 01:33:00,005
(Groaning)

1055
01:33:07,875 --> 01:33:11,505
Bill, what chance have I got?

1056
01:33:13,625 --> 01:33:15,218
A good one, Titus.

1057
01:33:17,917 --> 01:33:19,885
How far is it
to Mount Hooper depot now?

1058
01:33:20,500 --> 01:33:24,459
Eight and a half miles.
We'll do it in no time, Soldier.

1059
01:33:31,167 --> 01:33:32,419
(Groaning)

1060
01:33:42,500 --> 01:33:44,002
Purely medicinal.

1061
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,423
'What shall we find
at Mount Hooper depot?

1062
01:33:54,333 --> 01:33:57,132
'If oil is short again...'

1063
01:34:02,042 --> 01:34:03,043
There she is.

1064
01:34:13,125 --> 01:34:14,502
See, old chap?

1065
01:34:14,667 --> 01:34:16,169
Managed it all right.

1066
01:34:17,500 --> 01:34:20,094
- Wasn't so bad.
- Get the spades, Birdie.

1067
01:34:50,292 --> 01:34:51,714
Here it is.

1068
01:34:55,875 --> 01:34:56,876
It's not full.

1069
01:35:00,333 --> 01:35:02,176
The seal's not broken.

1070
01:35:02,292 --> 01:35:04,761
Odd things happen out here.
It must be evaporation.

1071
01:35:04,875 --> 01:35:06,127
Yes, but...

1072
01:35:08,083 --> 01:35:09,505
Come on, chaps.

1073
01:35:09,667 --> 01:35:11,635
No good arguing
the whys and wherefores.

1074
01:35:11,750 --> 01:35:13,093
Up tent.

1075
01:35:13,667 --> 01:35:16,716
'Among ourselves
we are unendingly cheerful.

1076
01:35:17,792 --> 01:35:21,717
'But what each man feels in his heart,
I can only guess.'

1077
01:35:24,292 --> 01:35:26,090
(Wind howling)

1078
01:35:31,958 --> 01:35:33,505
Letting up a little, I think.

1079
01:35:35,208 --> 01:35:37,006
(Intensive howling)

1080
01:36:16,250 --> 01:36:18,252
I hope I don't wake tomorrow, Bill.

1081
01:37:09,708 --> 01:37:13,417
I'm just going outside.
I may be away some time.

1082
01:38:06,500 --> 01:38:09,959
'A brave man and a gallant gentleman.

1083
01:38:21,292 --> 01:38:22,965
'This intense cold convinces me

1084
01:38:23,083 --> 01:38:26,542
'that the season has broken
far earlier than I expected.'

1085
01:39:00,625 --> 01:39:03,219
We'll be all right at One Ton.
It's full of stuff.

1086
01:40:53,417 --> 01:40:55,294
I thought for a moment
it might be old Titus.

1087
01:40:56,875 --> 01:40:58,252
Stupid of me.

1088
01:40:58,375 --> 01:40:59,376
<i>Sorry.-</i>

1089
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:20,174
Only 11 miles now, Bill.
Two good marches.

1090
01:41:21,958 --> 01:41:23,130
One if the snow holds off.

1091
01:41:58,708 --> 01:42:04,670
(Wilson) 'Captain Scott is now lying
in this tent with a frozen foot.

1092
01:42:07,292 --> 01:42:09,920

1093

'If the wind drops,

01:42:34,833 --> 01:42:37,006
'Only 11 miles.'

1099
01:43:05,708 --> 01:43:07,506
11 miles.

1100
01:43:23,958 --> 01:43:25,756
11 miles.

(Scott) 'Every step of the way.'
