1
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,080
Count, it's just you.

2
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,840
I was beginning
to lose faith, Victor.

3
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,360
A pity your moment of triumph
is being spoiled...

4
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,760
over a little thing
like grave robbery.

5
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,120
Yes.

6
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,600
[Pants] I must escape this place.

7
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,640
DRACULA: Where are you going to run,
Victor?

8
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:50,560
Your peculiar experiments
have made you unwelcome...

9
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,960
in most of the civilized world.

10
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,720
I'll take him away, far away,
where no one will ever find him.

11
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,480
DRACULA: No, no, Victor.

12
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,840
The time has come
for me to take command of him.

13
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,680
What are you saying?

14
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,800
Why do you think I brought you here?
Gave you this castle?

15
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,440
- Equipped your laboratory?
- You said...

16
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,960
- You said you believed in my work.
- And I do.

17
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,080
But now that it is,
as you yourself have said...

18
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,520
a triumph of science...

19
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,080
over God...

20
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,240
it must now serve my purpose.

21
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,040
What purpose?

22
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,640
Good God!

23
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,760
I would kill myself
before helping in such a task.

24
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:56,000
Feel free. I don't actually need you
anymore, Victor.

25
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,840
I just need him.

26
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,080
He is the key.

27
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,920
I could never allow him
to be used for such evil.

28
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,600
I could.

29
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,360
In fact,
my brides are insisting upon it.

30
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,000
[Loud, angry snarl]

31
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,800
Igor, help me!

32
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,840
IGOR: You have been
so kind to me, Doctor...

33
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,480
caring, thoughtful.

34
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,120
But he pays me.

35
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,240
VICTOR: Stay back.

36
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,800
You can't kill me, Victor.

37
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,720
I'm already dead.

38
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,520
Dr. Frankenstein!

39
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,280
Look, it's headed for the windmill!
Come on!

40
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,400
Burn it! Burn it down!

41
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,480
Vampires.

42
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,960
- Run for your lives!
-Vampires!

43
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,800
Father.

44
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,560
VAN HELSING: Evening.

45
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,640
You're a big one.
You'll be hard to digest.

46
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,160
I'd hate to be such a nuisance.

47
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,720
I missed you in London.

48
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:26,440
No, you bloody did not!
You got me good.

49
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,320
Dr. Jekyll, you're wanted
by the Knights of the Holy Order...

50
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,560
It's Mr. Hyde now.

51
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,440
...for the murder of 12 men,
six women, four...

52
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:38,200
...children, three goats, and
a rather nasty massacre of poultry!

53
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:42,360
So you're the great Van Helsing.

54
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,760
And you're a deranged psychopath.

55
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,560
We all have our little problems.

56
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,160
My superiors would like for me
to take you alive...

57
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,720
so that they may extricate
your better half.

58
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,200
[Grunts] I bet they bloody would.

59
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,960
Personally, I'd rather just kill you
and call it a day.

60
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,520
But let's make it your decision,
shall we?

61
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,000
Do let's.

62
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,080
MR. HYDE: Here I come...

63
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,560
ready or not!

64
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,680
MR. HYDE: No, no.

65
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,760
I'll bet that's upsetting.

66
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,080
Paris!

67
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,360
Come here.

68
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:39,080
I think you'll find the view
over here rather spectacular.

69
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,920
It's been a pleasure knowing you.
Au revoir!

70
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,600
Oh, no.

71
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,880
My turn.

72
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,160
May he rest in peace.

73
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,080
Van Helsing.

74
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,280
You murderer!

75
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,720
Bless me, Father, for I have...

76
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,600
CARDINAL: Sinned. Yes, I know.
You're very good at that.

77
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,240
You shattered the Rose Window.

78
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,960
Not to split hairs, sir,
but Mr. Hyde did the shattering.

79
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,560
13th century. Over 600 years old.

80
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,280
- I wish you a week in hell for that.
- It would be a nice reprieve.

81
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,640
Don't get me wrong.
Your results are unquestionable...

82
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,760
but your methods
attract far too much attention.

83
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,640
"Wanted" posters?
We are not pleased.

84
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,280
Do you think I like being
the most wanted man in Europe?

85
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,600
Why don't you and the Order
do something about it?

86
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,760
Because we do not exist.

87
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,000
Well, then neither do I.

88
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:13,040
CARDINAL: When we found you crawling up
the steps of this church, half-dead...

89
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,640
it was clear to all of us that
you had been sent to do God's work.

90
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,200
- Why can't he do it himself?
- Don't blaspheme.

91
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:22,800
You already lost your memory
as a penance for past sins.

92
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,200
CARDINAL: If you wish to recover it...

93
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,000
I suggest you continue
to heed the call.

94
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,400
Without us,
the world would be in darkness.

95
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,520
Governments and empires
come and go...

96
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,000
but we have kept mankind safe
since time immemorial.

97
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,800
CARDINAL: We are the last defense
against evil.

98
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,160
CARDINAL: An evil that the rest of mankind
has no idea even exists.

99
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,640
To you, these monsters are
just evil beings to be vanquished.

100
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,320
I'm the one standing there
when they die...

101
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,080
and become the men they once were.

102
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,520
For you, my good son,
this is all a test of faith.

103
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,360
And now,
we need you to go to the East.

104
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,400
To the far side of Romania.

105
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,720
An accursed land...

106
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,680
terrorized by all sorts
of nightmarish creatures.

107
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,960
CARDINAL: Lorded over
by a certain Count Dracula.

108
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,520
VAN HELSING: Dracula?
CARDINAL: Yes.

109
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,560
You've never faced one
like this before.

110
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,720
Our story begins 450 years ago...

111
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,240
when a Transylvanian knight
named Valerious the Elder...

112
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,840
promised God that his family
would never rest nor enter heaven...

113
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,800
until they vanquished Dracula
from their land.

114
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,200
They have not succeeded...

115
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,240
and they are running out of family.

116
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,200
CARDINAL: His descendant Boris Valerious,
King of the Gypsies.

117
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,840
He disappeared almost 12 months ago.

118
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:54,000
CARDINAL: His only son, Prince Velkan,
and his daughter, Princess Anna.

119
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,520
CARDINAL: If the two of them are killed
before Dracula is vanquished...

120
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,600
nine generations of their family...

121
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,240
will never enter
the gates of St. Peter.

122
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,560
For more than four centuries...

123
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,280
this family has defended
our left flank.

124
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,120
They gave their lives.

125
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,400
We cannot let them
slip into purgatory.

126
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,720
So you're sending me into hell.

127
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,000
In a manner.

128
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:24,480
Valerious the Elder left this here
400 years ago.

129
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,960
We don't know its purpose...

130
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,520
but he would not have
left it lightly.

131
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,080
The Latin inscription translates as:

132
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,280
"In the name of God,
open this door."

133
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,000
There is an insignia.

134
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,400
Yes, it matches your ring.

135
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,520
I think that in Transylvania
you may find the answer you seek.

136
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,400
CARL: Faster, please. Faster!

137
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,200
Faster! Faster! Faster!

138
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,760
Getting there.

139
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,600
- Carl!
- There you are.

140
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,800
Did you bring Mr. Hyde back,
or did you kill him?

141
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,600
You killed him, didn't you?
That's why they get so annoyed.

142
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,800
When they ask you to bring someone
back, they don't mean as a corpse.

143
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,720
CARL: All right, you're in a mood.
Come on.

144
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,360
I have some things that'll
put the bit back in your mouth.

145
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,440
Any idiot can make a sword.

146
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,360
Sorry, Father.

147
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,880
VAN HELSING: Come along, Carl.
CARL: Here, take this:

148
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,920
Rings of garlic, holy water...

149
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,120
silver stake, crucifix.

150
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,000
Why can't I have one of those?

151
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,520
You've never gone after vampires
before now, have you?

152
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,800
Vampires, gargoyles, warlocks,
they're all the same.

153
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,240
VAN HELSING: Best when cooked well.

154
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,360
No, they're not all the same.

155
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,800
A vampire is nothing like a warlock.
My granny could kill a warlock.

156
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,800
Carl, you've never even been
out of the abbey.

157
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,600
- How do you know about vampires?
- I read.

158
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,320
Here's something new.

159
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,760
Glycerin 48.

160
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,760
CARL: Sorry!

161
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,240
MULLAH: What in Allah's name
is wrong with you?

162
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,760
The air around here
is thick with envy.

163
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,520
This is my latest invention.
It's gas-propelled.

164
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,800
Capable of catapulting arrows
in rapid succession...

165
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,400
at tremendous velocity.
Just pull the trigger and hold on.

166
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,120
I've heard the stories
from Transylvania.

167
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,080
Trust me, you'll need this.
A work of certifiable genius.

168
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,200
- Lf you don't say so yourself.
- No, I did say so myself.

169
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,040
I'm a veritable cornucopia
of talent.

170
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,560
Did you invent this?

171
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,400
I've been working on that
for 12 years.

172
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,320
It's compressed magma
from Mt. Vesuvius...

173
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,400
with pure alkaline
from the Gobi Desert.

174
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,520
- It's one of a kind.
- What's it for?

175
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:45,040
I don't know,
but I'm sure it'll come in handy.

176
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,280
Twelve years,
and you don't know what it does?

177
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,840
I didn't say that.
I said I didn't know what it's for.

178
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,240
What it does
is to create a light source...

179
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,840
equal to the intensity of the sun.

180
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,440
This will come in handy how?

181
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,680
I don't know.
You can blind your enemies.

182
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,880
Charbroil a herd
of charging wildebeest.

183
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,360
Use your imagination.

184
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,080
No, I'm gonna use yours.
That's why you're coming with me.

185
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,560
CARL: Holy hell be damned I am!
VAN HELSING: You cursed.

186
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,240
Not very well, but you're a monk.

187
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,600
You shouldn't curse at all.

188
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:13,120
Actually, I'm still just a friar.
I can curse all I want...

189
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,320
damn it!

190
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,360
The Cardinal has ordered you
to keep me alive.

191
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,200
- For as long as possible.
- But I'm not a field man.

192
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,120
CARL: I don't want to go to Transylvania.

193
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,560
Come on.

194
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,920
Dracula unleashed you for a reason.

195
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,720
Pull me up!

196
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,120
It's stuck!

197
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,320
- No, Anna, it will kill you!
- That's my brother out there.

198
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,040
Cut the rope! Cut it now!

199
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,440
Velkan!

200
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,720
My gun! Find my gun!

201
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:19,480
Find Velkan's gun.
It has to be the silver bullets.

202
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,960
Anna, hurry!

203
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,400
Hurry!

204
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,000
Move.

205
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,280
VELKAN: Anna, look out!

206
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,720
Run!

207
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,880
Velkan.

208
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:11,960
God...

209
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,160
help us.

210
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,840
CARL: So, what do you remember?
VAN HELSING: Not now, Carl.

211
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,000
There must be something.

212
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:32,120
I remember fighting the Romans
at Masada.

213
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:35,000
- That was in 73 A.D.
- You asked.

214
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,320
CARL: What are we doing here?

215
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,640
Why is it so important
to kill this Dracula, anyway?

216
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,600
- Because he's the son of the Devil.
- I mean, besides that.

217
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:47,640
If we kill him, anything bitten
or created by him will also die.

218
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,920
I mean, besides that.

219
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,640
Welcome to Transylvania.

220
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,400
- Is it always like this?
- Pretty much.

221
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,440
ANNA: You, turn around.

222
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,280
- Let me see your faces.
- Why?

223
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,520
Because we don't trust strangers.

224
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,840
Strangers don't last long here.

225
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,400
5'7" by 2'3".

226
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,640
Gentlemen, you will now be disarmed.

227
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,960
You can try.

228
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,800
ANNA: You refuse to obey our laws?

229
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:37,000
- The laws of men mean little to me.
- Fine.

230
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,680
Kill them.

231
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,480
- I'm here to help you.
- I don't need any help.

232
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,760
Really?

233
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,760
Everybody inside!

234
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,840
Hide the children!

235
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:07,240
[lntense instrumental music]

236
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,600
VAN HELSING: Stay here.

237
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,560
You stay here.
They're trying to kill me.

238
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,520
- Marishka, kill the stranger.
- Love to.

239
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,240
ANNA: Run!

240
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,680
Carl, it's not working.

241
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,480
CARL: Try aiming at their hearts.

242
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,440
It's the sun.

243
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,840
Van Helsing.

244
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:52,520
Do you like to fly, Anna?

245
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,600
Hello, Anna.

246
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,720
Nice to see you, too, Aleera.

247
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,440
Did I do something to you
in a past life?

248
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,760
Don't play coy with me, Princess.

249
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,560
I know what lurks
in your lusting heart.

250
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,200
I hope you have a heart, Aleera...

251
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:54,160
because someday I'm going to drive
a stake through it.

252
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,560
CARL: This should do the trick.

253
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,120
Holy water!

254
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:18,480
Stop your teasing, Marishka,
and finish him.

255
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,400
Too bad. So sad.

256
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,400
The church!

257
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,680
Thirty years old.

258
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,680
Perfectly aged.

259
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,480
Hello, Anna, my dear.

260
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,920
The last of the Valerious.

261
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:34,400
I can feel fresh blood
rushing through her veins.

262
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,440
Here she comes!

263
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,240
I want first bite.

264
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,760
VILLAGER #1: He killed a bride!
VILLAGER #2: He killed Marishka!

265
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
VILLAGER #3: You killed Marishka!

266
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,440
VILLAGER #4: You killed a vampire!
CARL: But isn't that a good thing?

267
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:16,320
Vampires only kill what they need
to survive.

268
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,400
One or two people a month.

269
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,760
Now they will kill for revenge.

270
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,320
- Are you always this popular?
- Pretty much.

271
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,720
So what name, my good sir,
do I carve on your gravestone?

272
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,880
His name is Van Helsing.

273
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,440
Your reputation precedes you.

274
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,440
Next time stay close.
You're no good to me dead.

275
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:55,200
Well, I'll say this for you.
You've got courage.

276
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,880
He's the first one to kill a vampire
in over 100 years.

277
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,600
I'd say that's earned him a drink.

278
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,600
Marishka!

279
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,880
DRACULA: Why can't they just
leave us alone?

280
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:24,120
We never kill more than our fill
and less than our share.

281
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,000
Can they say the same?

282
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,280
Did I not stress
how important it was...

283
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,880
to be finished
with Anna Valerious...

284
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:35,520
before she destroys
what we are trying to create?

285
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:38,600
VERONA: We lost Marishka.
ALEERA: Master.

286
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:42,120
There, there, my darlings.
Do not worry.

287
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,880
- I shall find another bride.
- What?

288
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:50,240
- Do we mean so little to you?
- Have you no heart?

289
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:54,560
No, I have no heart! I feel no love!

290
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,600
Nor fear...

291
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,120
nor joy...

292
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,880
nor sorrow!

293
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,120
I am hollow.

294
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:12,960
And I will live forever.

295
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,600
- My Lord.
- It is not so bad.

296
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,760
DRACULA: I am at war with the world...

297
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,880
and every living soul in it.

298
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:28,560
But soon
the final battle will begin.

299
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,720
I must go and find out
who our new visitor is.

300
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:39,120
You will have to make
a little apéritif out of him.

301
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:42,600
We are much too close to success
to be interrupted now.

302
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:46,240
ALEERA: No!
VERONA: The last experiment was a failure!

303
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:50,240
Please, say you will not try again.

304
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:54,760
My heart could not bear the sorrow
if we fail again.

305
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,560
Come.

306
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:09,240
DRACULA: Do not fear me.

307
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,720
Everybody else fears me.

308
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,360
Not my brides.

309
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,400
DRACULA: lgor.

310
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,360
Yes, master.

311
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,560
Why do you torment that thing so?

312
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,720
It's what I do.

313
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,440
Remember, lgor, "Do unto others..."

314
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:34,560
Before they do unto me, master.

315
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,640
Now go, all of you!

316
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,440
To Castle Frankenstein!

317
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:45,240
ALEERA: Yes, we will try again.

318
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:51,560
- So, how did you get here?
- We came by sea.

319
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,480
ANNA: Really? The sea?
CARL: Well, yes.

320
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:56,200
ANNA: The Adriatic Sea?
VAN HELSING: Where do I find Dracula?

321
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:59,640
ANNA: He used to live in this very house
four centuries ago.

322
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,560
No one knows where he lives now.

323
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,640
Father would stare at that painting
for hours...

324
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,400
Iooking for Dracula's lair.

325
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:08,280
ANNA: So that's why you've come?
VAN HELSING: I can help you.

326
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,160
- No one can help me.
- I can try.

327
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:14,080
You can die trying.
All of my family has.

328
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:17,000
ANNA: I can handle this myself.
VAN HELSING: So I noticed.

329
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,560
The vampires attacked in daylight.
They never do that.

330
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,960
I was unprepared.
It won't happen again.

331
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,720
So why did they attack in daylight?

332
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,040
Clearly they wanted
to catch me off guard.

333
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,320
They seem almost desperate
to finish off my family.

334
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:31,640
- Why is that? Why now?
- You ask a lot of questions.

335
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,080
Usually I ask only two:

336
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,920
What are we dealing with?
How do I kill it?

337
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,560
My father spent most of his life
looking for answers year after year.

338
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:41,560
Tearing through the tower,
combing through the family archives.

339
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,840
- Carl, the tower. Start there.
- Right.

340
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:47,240
The only way to save your family is
to stay alive till Dracula's killed.

341
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:50,760
And who will kill him if not me?
Who will show courage if not me?

342
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:53,240
Go alone and you'll be outmanned
and outpositioned.

343
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,160
And you can't see in the dark.

344
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,640
In the morning, we will hunt him...

345
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,280
but we'll do it together.

346
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,920
Some say you're a murderer,
Mr. Van Helsing.

347
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:12,920
Others say you're a holy man.
Which is it?

348
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,360
It's a bit of both, I think.

349
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:24,560
- I promised you a drink.
- Yes, you did.

350
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,960
The bar is down the hall.
Help yourself.

351
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:31,240
ANNA: As for me, I'm going to finish this
once and for all.

352
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,720
VAN HELSING: Sorry you've to carry
this burden alone.

353
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,040
On the contrary,
I would wish for it no other way.

354
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,720
I'm sorry about your father
and brother.

355
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,160
I will see them again.

356
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:42,080
We Transylvanians always look
on the brighter side of death.

357
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:46,280
- There's a brighter side of death?
- Yes. It's just harder to see.

358
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,920
I'm sorry about that, too.

359
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,920
Van Helsing!

360
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,760
Van Helsing?

361
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,560
- Velkan?
- Anna.

362
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,320
Oh, my God, you're alive.

363
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,920
No. Anna, I only have a moment.

364
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,240
ANNA: But there's a werewolf...
VELKAN: Listen to me!

365
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,640
I know Dracula's secret.
He has a...

366
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,560
ANNA: Velkan?
VELKAN: Please.

367
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,480
No!

368
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,240
Run, Anna.

369
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,360
VAN HELSING: Anna!

370
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:57,080
Are you all right?

371
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,200
Anna!

372
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:15,240
Why does it smell
like wet dog in here?

373
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:16,360
Werewolf!

374
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:18,360
Right. You'll be needing
silver bullets, then.

375
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:19,720
VAN HELSING: Well done.

376
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,160
Who's hunting whom?

377
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:20,160
Nice night.
This is a bit tight for me.

378
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:24,160
But for you it's a perfect fit.

379
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,200
TOP HAT: What a coincidence.

380
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:30,240
TOP HAT: I see the wolf man
hasn't killed you yet.

381
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,160
VAN HELSING: Don't worry, he's getting to it.

382
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:33,680
VAN HELSING: You don't seem bothered.

383
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,200
TOP HAT: I'm no threat to him.

384
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:38,080
I'm just the one
who cleans up after him...

385
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,000
if you get my meaning.

386
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:42,080
Little late to be digging graves,
isn't it?

387
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:44,320
Never too late to dig graves.

388
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:49,120
You never know
when you'll need a fresh one.

389
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:55,760
Oh, sorry. It's just my nature.

390
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:14,000
- Move!
- No!

391
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,800
VAN HELSING: Why?
ANNA: You're choking me!

392
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:25,680
- Give me a reason not to.
- I can't. If people knew...

393
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,280
He's not your brother anymore, Anna!

394
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:35,120
- You knew?
- Yes.

395
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:39,600
Before or after I stopped you
from shooting him?

396
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:40,640
Before.

397
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,160
And still you tried to kill him!

398
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,000
He's a werewolf!
He's gonna kill people!

399
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:45,520
He can't help it!
It's not his fault!

400
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:46,880
I know, but he'll do it anyway!

401
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,120
Do you understand forgiveness?

402
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:51,680
Yes. I ask for it often.

403
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:55,920
They say Dracula has a cure.

404
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,920
If there's a chance
I can save my brother...

405
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,120
- I'm going after it.
- No.

406
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,920
- I need to find Dracula.
- And I need to find my brother!

407
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,520
He gave his life for me.
He's the only family I have left.

408
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:09,680
I despise Dracula
more than you can ever imagine.

409
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:13,920
He has taken everything from me,
leaving me alone in this world.

410
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:31,280
To have memories
of those you loved and lost...

411
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:34,960
is perhaps harder
than to have no memories at all.

412
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,320
All right.

413
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,400
We'll look for your brother.

414
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:12,720
- Igor.
- Yes, master.

415
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:16,160
- How long before we are ready?
- Soon, master. Very soon.

416
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:19,840
It is difficult
without the good doctor...

417
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,160
but the Dwergi, they are doing well?

418
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:24,320
No!

419
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:26,720
Good.

420
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:33,120
ANNA: For me, this is all personal.
It's all about family and honour.

421
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:37,360
Why do you do it, this job of yours?
What do you hope to get out of it?

422
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:40,160
I don't know.
Maybe some self-realization.

423
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:43,280
What have you got out of it so far?

424
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,440
Nightmares.

425
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:50,720
Werewolves only shed
before the first full moon.

426
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,800
Before the curse
has completely consumed them.

427
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:06,240
VAN HELSING: What is this place?
ANNA: Castle Frankenstein.

428
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,480
ANNA: But it should be abandoned.

429
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:09,680
I don't understand.

430
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:12,080
The man who lived here
was killed a year ago.

431
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:14,640
- A grave robber, among other things.
- A year ago.

432
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:17,120
It was just after that
that your father went missing.

433
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:20,880
ANNA: Yes. He was looking for Dracula.
He was on his way to the sea.

434
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:24,160
I have never been to the sea.

435
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,200
I'll bet it's beautiful.

436
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:52,000
Werewolves are such a nuisance
during their first full moon.

437
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,880
So hard to control.

438
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,680
I send you on a simple errand...

439
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:22,160
to find out
who our new visitor is...

440
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:26,080
and you have to stop
for a little chat with your sister.

441
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:29,760
Leave her out of this, Count.
She doesn't know your secret.

442
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,320
And I am soon to take it
to my grave.

443
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:36,960
DRACULA: Don't wish for death so quickly.
I intend for you to be quite useful.

444
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,720
VELKAN: I would rather die than help you.

445
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,760
Don't be boring.
Everyone who says that dies.

446
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:43,360
Besides, tonight...

447
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:45,280
after the final stroke
of midnight...

448
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:47,840
you will have no choice
but to obey me.

449
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:51,680
Look familiar?

450
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,200
Father?

451
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:59,600
No!

452
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,040
He proved useless.

453
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:04,240
But I'm hoping, with werewolf venom
running through your veins...

454
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:06,240
you will be of greater benefit!

455
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:13,920
I may have failed to kill you,
Count, but my sister will not.

456
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:22,160
VELKAN: Never!

457
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:41,200
ANNA: Dwergi.
VAN HELSING: Dwergi?

458
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:44,560
Dracula's servants.
Industrious but extremely vicious.

459
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:46,560
If you get the chance to kill one,
do it...

460
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:49,280
- Because they'll do worse to you.
- Right.

461
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:57,200
They say they're using my brother
in some sort of experiment.

462
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:59,600
My brother is still battling
the sickness within him.

463
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:01,600
- There's still hope.
- Anna.

464
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:04,640
There is no hope for your brother.

465
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:08,000
But we can still protect others
by killing Dracula.

466
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,320
Let us begin!

467
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:28,080
IGOR: "No slacking! Up! "

468
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,480
VAN HELSING: You ever see these things?
ANNA: No.

469
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:47,120
ANNA: What do you think they are?
VAN HELSING: Offspring.

470
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:48,240
ANNA: What?

471
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:50,640
VAN HELSING: A man with
three gorgeous women for 400 years.

472
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:52,800
Yes, vampires are the walking dead.

473
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:55,280
It only makes sense
their children are born dead.

474
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:58,160
He's obviously trying
to bring them to life.

475
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:04,040
[Clears throat] Ladies first.

476
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:31,720
Dracula and his brides only kill
one or two people a month.

477
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:34,760
If he brings
all these things to life...

478
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:53,320
DRACULA: Throw the switches!
IGOR: Yes, master.

479
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:29,000
What are you doing?

480
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:31,160
I want to see what we're up against.

481
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:03,320
So this is what you get
when vampires mate.

482
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:25,800
Come on!

483
00:54:56,120 --> 00:55:00,360
They need to feed.
Teach them how. Teach them!

484
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:10,360
And beg the Devil...

485
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:14,120
that this time they stay alive.

486
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:25,880
- This is where I come in.
- No, wait!

487
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:38,360
Now that I have your attention...

488
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:03,400
CARL: Yes, well, that's interesting.

489
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:06,520
[Strange low howling]

490
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:14,920
That's not good. Must warn somebody.

491
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:31,960
I can tell the character of a man
by the sound of his heartbeat.

492
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,800
Usually when I approach...

493
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:40,520
I can almost dance to the beat.

494
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:46,280
Strange that yours is so steady.

495
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:56,040
IGOR: "Hurry up! "

496
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:01,240
IGOR: We must keep
the atmosphere electrified!

497
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:05,000
Accelerate the generators!

498
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:07,720
Power the dynamos!

499
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:10,600
We are losing power.

500
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:13,560
The human is insufficient.

501
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:20,200
Velkan.

502
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:34,360
Oh, my God.

503
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:08,280
Feed, my darlings! Feed!

504
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:31,000
May he rest in peace.

505
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:35,320
Hello, Gabriel.

506
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:34,600
We must not lose
the master's progeny!

507
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:39,720
Is this your silver stake?

508
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:47,320
How long has it been?
300, 400 years?

509
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:54,120
You don't remember, do you?

510
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:56,720
Exactly what is it
I should be remembering?

511
00:59:57,880 --> 01:00:00,000
You are the great Van Helsing.

512
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:03,240
Trained by monks and mullahs
from Tibet to Istanbul.

513
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:08,720
Protected by Rome herself.

514
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:12,720
But, like me, hunted by all others.

515
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:14,960
The Knights of the Holy Order
know all about you.

516
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:16,880
It's no surprise
you would know about me.

517
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:18,880
Yes, but it's much more than this.

518
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:27,920
We have such history,
you and I, Gabriel.

519
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:36,000
DRACULA: Have you ever wondered why
you have such horrible nightmares?

520
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:40,560
Horrific scenes
of ancient battles past.

521
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:46,560
How do you know me?

522
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:56,800
- Velkan.
- Anna.

523
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:58,560
No. Don't unstrap me.

524
01:00:58,640 --> 01:00:59,760
Don't unstrap me!

525
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:02,560
No, you must not! No! Stop!

526
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:04,160
Stop it.
I'm getting you out of here.

527
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:06,720
Velkan, it's all right.
I'm taking you home.

528
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:17,040
So would you like me
to refresh your memory a little?

529
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:21,040
A few details from your sordid past.

530
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:33,600
Perhaps that is a conversation
for another time.

531
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:39,200
Allow me to reintroduce myself.

532
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:44,560
I am Count Vladislaus Dragulia.

533
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:48,880
Born 1422.

534
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:53,360
Murdered 1462.

535
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:08,000
Help me!

536
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:56,720
I think
we've overstayed our welcome.

537
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:43,840
MAN #1: Have you found the children?
MAN #2: Not yet.

538
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:50,320
- What happened?
- They just died.

539
01:03:55,120 --> 01:03:57,120
How can I ever repay you?

540
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:06,800
But you can't do that.
You are a monk.

541
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:09,120
Well, actually I'm just a friar.

542
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:15,280
IGOR: I am sorry, master.
We try and we try...

543
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:19,680
but I fear we are not so smart
as Dr. Frankenstein.

544
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:21,440
Truly.

545
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:26,400
It would appear the good doctor
took the key to life to his grave.

546
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:32,960
Hunt them down.

547
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:36,960
Kill them both.

548
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:42,160
ANNA: A silver stake? A crucifix?

549
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:45,040
ANNA: What, did you think
we haven't tried everything before?

550
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:47,600
ANNA: We've shot him, stabbed him,
clubbed him...

551
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:50,320
sprayed him with holy water,
staked him through the heart...

552
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:52,080
and still he lives!
Do you understand?

553
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:54,080
No one knows how to kill Dracula.

554
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:57,600
Well, I could have used
that information a little earlier.

555
01:04:57,920 --> 01:04:59,840
Don't give me that look.

556
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:06,800
You were right. I'm sorry.

557
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:09,680
He's not my brother anymore.

558
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:26,400
Do you have any family,
Mr. Van Helsing?

559
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:30,560
Not sure.
I hope to find out someday.

560
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:32,640
That's what keeps me going.

561
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:37,520
- Here's to what keeps you going.
- Absinthe. Strong stuff.

562
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:44,160
Don't let it touch your tongue.
It'll knock you on your...

563
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:05,360
Vampire.

564
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:09,520
Vampires!

565
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:18,160
Now I remember.

566
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:33,840
"Even a man who is pure in heart
And says his prayers by night

567
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:38,720
"May become a wolf
when the wolfbane blooms

568
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:41,600
"And the moon is shining bright

569
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:45,200
"Or crave another's blood
when the sun goes down

570
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:47,440
"And his body takes to flight"

571
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:50,320
[Clock chiming]

572
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:12,000
25.000

573
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:27,040
There's something down here.

574
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:31,120
VAN HELSING: And it's carnivorous.

575
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:37,200
VAN HELSING: Whatever it is,
it appears to be human.

576
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:45,760
I'd say he's a size 17.
Around 360 pounds.

577
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:48,640
8.5 to 9 feet tall.

578
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:53,520
He has a bad gimp in his right leg
and three copper teeth.

579
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:55,680
How do you know he has copper teeth?

580
01:07:55,720 --> 01:07:58,120
Because he's standing
right behind you. Move!

581
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:06,360
Oh, my God!
The Frankenstein monster!

582
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:09,480
Monster? Who's the monster here?

583
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:13,080
I have done nothing wrong...

584
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:16,200
and yet you and your kind
all wish me dead!

585
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:38,680
What do you want?

586
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:42,040
To exist.

587
01:08:54,200 --> 01:08:55,280
Don't!

588
01:08:55,560 --> 01:08:56,920
- We must kill it.
- Wait.

589
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:00,280
If you value your lives
and the lives of your kind...

590
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:03,160
- You will kill me.
- No.

591
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:05,880
If Dracula finds me...

592
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:11,280
I am the key to my father's machine.

593
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:14,040
The key to life.

594
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:17,560
Life for Dracula's children.

595
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:19,160
He already awakened them last night.

596
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:20,360
FRANKENSTEIN: Two.

597
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:23,800
And those were from only one bride.

598
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:27,760
From one single birthing.

599
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:31,280
And they died
as they did the last time he tried.

600
01:09:34,360 --> 01:09:39,080
Only with me
can he give them lasting life.

601
01:09:39,280 --> 01:09:41,720
There are more?
More of those things?

602
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:44,040
Thousands.

603
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:47,000
Thousands more.

604
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:02,040
VAN HELSING: No.
ANNA: You heard what he said.

605
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:05,080
My life, my job is to vanquish evil.

606
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:06,760
I can sense evil.

607
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:09,080
VAN HELSING: This thing, man,
whatever it is...

608
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:11,560
evil may have created it,
may have left its mark on it.

609
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:14,520
But evil does not rule it,
so I cannot kill it.

610
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:17,000
- I can.
- Not while I'm here.

611
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:21,800
Anna.

612
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:24,920
Your family has spent 400 years
trying to kill Dracula.

613
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,960
Maybe this poor creature
can help us find a way.

614
01:10:36,760 --> 01:10:39,280
Oh, my God. He's seen us.

615
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:41,320
Now they'll come for him.

616
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:43,280
Neither you nor I
will be able to stop them.

617
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:46,520
If I can get him to Rome,
we can protect him there.

618
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:48,040
And then the painting came alive...

619
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:49,840
and the two creatures
attacked each other.

620
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:51,760
- What does it mean?
- I don't know.

621
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:54,520
Listen, Carl, whatever you do,
don't stare at him.

622
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:57,840
I'm staring at him.

623
01:10:58,280 --> 01:10:59,640
Is that a man?

624
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:01,800
VAN HELSING: Actually, seven men.
Parts, anyway.

625
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:04,360
By exposing me,
you have condemned me!

626
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:06,280
Me and all of humanity!

627
01:11:06,280 --> 01:11:08,760
Nothing is faster
than Transylvanian horses.

628
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:10,520
Not even a werewolf.

629
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:13,080
Anything else, you're on your own.

630
01:11:26,680 --> 01:11:29,280
- Let me go.
- Where are you going to go?

631
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:31,160
I don't know
if you've seen a mirror lately...

632
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:32,800
but you kind of stick out
in a crowd.

633
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:49,000
We must not let the creature
be destroyed!

634
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:58,040
Save him! Save the monster!

635
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:19,160
VERONA: Stakes!

636
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:30,800
No!

637
01:14:50,440 --> 01:14:51,760
CARL: Oh, my God.

638
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:01,080
What are you doing out here?

639
01:15:01,160 --> 01:15:02,360
Right.

640
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:04,280
Don't let go!

641
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:18,320
I can help!

642
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:19,800
You won't kill me?

643
01:15:19,880 --> 01:15:21,800
Only if you don't hurry!

644
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:05,120
Jump!

645
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:42,640
Velkan.

646
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,120
Anna...

647
01:16:58,480 --> 01:16:59,800
forgive me.

648
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,760
I will see you again.

649
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:22,080
ANNA: You killed him.

650
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,480
Now you know
why they call me murderer.

651
01:17:34,280 --> 01:17:35,600
Oh, my God.

652
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:39,040
You've been bitten.

653
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:53,920
Anna!

654
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:06,800
Anna.

655
01:18:30,720 --> 01:18:34,760
So much trouble to my master.
So much trouble.

656
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:36,240
What do you want?

657
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:38,640
ALEERA: The master commands a trade.

658
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:44,560
The monster for the Princess.

659
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:47,240
Somewhere public. Lots of people.

660
01:18:49,680 --> 01:18:51,800
A place where your master
will be less inclined...

661
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:53,840
to expose his other side.

662
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:59,040
Tomorrow night is All Hallows' Eve.

663
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:04,240
Here in Budapest there is
a wonderful masquerade ball.

664
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:16,560
- Are you all right?
- No.

665
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:21,240
He has been bitten.

666
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:23,040
FRANKENSTEIN: Bitten by a werewolf.

667
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:28,080
Now you will become that which
you have hunted so passionately.

668
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:36,880
I am sorry.

669
01:19:37,720 --> 01:19:41,120
May others be as passionate
in their hunting of you.

670
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:48,280
VAN HELSING: Well,
they won't find him in here.

671
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:50,160
I'm sure this is some sort of sin.

672
01:19:50,240 --> 01:19:52,800
VAN HELSING: God will forgive us.
We need to save Anna.

673
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:54,320
You don't think
the hat's a bit much?

674
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:56,080
VAN HELSING: Carl, help me!
CARL: Right.

675
01:19:56,160 --> 01:19:58,800
CARL: How many commandments
can we break in one day?

676
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:00,760
CARL: Anyway, according to the book...

677
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:04,240
you won't turn into a werewolf until
the rising of your first full moon.

678
01:20:04,240 --> 01:20:05,600
CARL: That's two nights from now.

679
01:20:05,720 --> 01:20:08,560
CARL: You'll still be able
to fight Dracula's hold over you...

680
01:20:08,640 --> 01:20:10,000
until the final stroke of midnight.

681
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:11,800
VAN HELSING: So I have nothing
to worry about.

682
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:13,240
CARL: My God, you should be terrified.

683
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:14,560
VAN HELSING: Thanks.
CARL: Sorry.

684
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:17,040
CARL: We still have 48 hours
to find a solution.

685
01:20:17,720 --> 01:20:19,240
You sure he can't get out of there?

686
01:20:19,240 --> 01:20:21,600
VAN HELSING: Not without
some help from the dead.

687
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:46,400
How does it feel
to be a puppet on my string?

688
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:48,880
I won't let you trade me, Count.

689
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:51,720
I have no intention of trading you.

690
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:54,760
DRACULA: And if I know Van Helsing,
which I do...

691
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:57,280
he is not planning on
making a trade, either.

692
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:01,520
Neither of us
has ever settled for half.

693
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:09,240
There they are.

694
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:11,120
You make my skin crawl.

695
01:22:12,280 --> 01:22:16,800
This is not all I could do
with your skin.

696
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:28,560
Carl, I need you to do something.

697
01:22:28,640 --> 01:22:30,480
I'm not gonna like this, am I?

698
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:37,040
DRACULA: Don't we make a lovely couple?

699
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:38,800
Oh, my God.

700
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:41,040
DRACULA: I am looking
for a new bride, Anna.

701
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:45,120
Someone strong and beautiful.

702
01:22:56,240 --> 01:22:58,480
One brief moment of pain...

703
01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:02,080
and we can be together forever.

704
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:11,920
You have no heartbeat.

705
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:16,560
DRACULA: Perhaps it just needs...

706
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:19,120
to be rekindled.

707
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:44,880
Anna. Anna!

708
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:46,240
VAN HELSING: Wake up.

709
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:48,240
DRACULA: Gabriel.

710
01:23:56,520 --> 01:23:58,440
Oh, Gabriel.

711
01:24:01,400 --> 01:24:03,560
Welcome to my summer palace.

712
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:08,760
Master! Look, master!

713
01:24:10,280 --> 01:24:12,440
We have him, master.

714
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:13,880
We have him!

715
01:24:15,560 --> 01:24:17,880
You wretched undead...

716
01:24:18,040 --> 01:24:20,200
I shall have my revenge!

717
01:24:20,720 --> 01:24:23,960
"Though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death...

718
01:24:24,120 --> 01:24:26,840
"I shall fear no evil."

719
01:24:26,920 --> 01:24:29,800
You are nothing but damned bones...

720
01:24:30,120 --> 01:24:32,120
and damned souls...

721
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:36,360
and will burn in the flames of Hell!

722
01:24:41,680 --> 01:24:45,200
Now that everything
is as it should be...

723
01:24:46,680 --> 01:24:50,360
ladies and gentlemen,
I give to you...

724
01:24:51,960 --> 01:24:53,960
Van Helsing!

725
01:24:58,920 --> 01:25:00,120
Come on.

726
01:25:03,080 --> 01:25:05,000
Yes!

727
01:25:10,720 --> 01:25:13,320
Now I know what it's for.

728
01:25:13,960 --> 01:25:16,360
- Where are we going?
- Through that window!

729
01:25:33,560 --> 01:25:35,400
Carl, you're a genius!

730
01:25:36,040 --> 01:25:38,720
A genius with access
to unstable chemicals.

731
01:25:49,960 --> 01:25:52,200
Say goodbye to your friends.

732
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:14,200
I'll find you!
I'll get you back and set you free!

733
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:15,720
I swear to God!

734
01:26:23,200 --> 01:26:25,240
- I must save him.
- No, you can't.

735
01:26:25,400 --> 01:26:26,440
Why?

736
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:29,000
I cabled Rome earlier
to apprise them of our situation.

737
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:30,040
What did they say?

738
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:31,560
CARL: Even if you kill Dracula...

739
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:34,520
Rome orders you to destroy
Frankenstein as well.

740
01:26:34,600 --> 01:26:35,640
He isn't evil.

741
01:26:35,720 --> 01:26:37,240
But they say he isn't human, either.

742
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:40,200
Do they know him? Have they spoken
to him? Who are they to judge?

743
01:26:40,240 --> 01:26:43,400
They want you to destroy him so he
can never be used to harm humanity.

744
01:26:43,480 --> 01:26:45,680
What of me? Did you tell them
what I'm to become?

745
01:26:45,720 --> 01:26:47,480
VAN HELSING: Did they tell you
how to kill me?

746
01:26:47,560 --> 01:26:50,040
The correct angle of the stake
as it enters my heart?

747
01:26:50,120 --> 01:26:52,600
The exact measure of silver
in each bullet?

748
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:55,400
ANNA: Stop!
CARL: No, I left you out!

749
01:27:13,200 --> 01:27:14,520
I'm sorry.

750
01:27:19,240 --> 01:27:20,720
It's starting.

751
01:27:34,760 --> 01:27:38,280
They must have taken
all the equipment to Dracula's lair.

752
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:40,200
Wherever that is.

753
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:46,440
Look, there's still time.

754
01:27:46,520 --> 01:27:49,320
Dracula can't bring his children
to life until the sun sets.

755
01:27:49,400 --> 01:27:50,520
The sun sets in two hours.

756
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:53,000
We've been looking for him
for more than 400 years!

757
01:27:53,080 --> 01:27:56,600
Yes, well, I wasn't around
for those 400 years, now, was I?

758
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:59,080
VAN HELSING: Okay, Carl,
what have you learned?

759
01:27:59,160 --> 01:28:02,200
That Count Dracula was actually
the son of Valerious the Elder.

760
01:28:02,280 --> 01:28:03,560
The son of your ancestor.

761
01:28:03,640 --> 01:28:05,480
Everybody knows that. What else?

762
01:28:05,640 --> 01:28:08,920
All right.
Well, according to this rubbing...

763
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:10,920
it all started
when Dracula was murdered.

764
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:12,520
VAN HELSING: Do you know
who murdered him?

765
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:15,560
CARL: No, there's just some vague reference
to the Left Hand of God.

766
01:28:15,640 --> 01:28:19,000
And in 1462, when Dracula died...

767
01:28:19,080 --> 01:28:22,200
- He made a covenant with the Devil.
- And was given a new life.

768
01:28:22,280 --> 01:28:25,160
But the only way he could sustain
that life was by drinking blood.

769
01:28:25,240 --> 01:28:27,320
Excuse me. Are you going to
let me tell the story?

770
01:28:27,400 --> 01:28:28,440
BOTH: Sorry.

771
01:28:28,520 --> 01:28:31,400
And your ancestor,
having sired this evil creature...

772
01:28:31,480 --> 01:28:35,560
went to Rome to seek forgiveness.
That's when the bargain was made.

773
01:28:35,640 --> 01:28:36,840
He was to kill Dracula...

774
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:40,280
in return for eternal salvation
of his entire family...

775
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:42,600
right down the line
all the way to you.

776
01:28:42,680 --> 01:28:44,280
ANNA: But he couldn't do it.

777
01:28:44,360 --> 01:28:47,240
As evil as Dracula was, my ancestor
couldn't kill his own son.

778
01:28:47,320 --> 01:28:50,440
So he banished him
to an icy fortress...

779
01:28:50,520 --> 01:28:53,160
sending him through a door
from which there was no return.

780
01:28:53,240 --> 01:28:55,000
- And then the Devil gave him wings.
- Yes.

781
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:58,120
- All right, so where is this door?
- I don't know.

782
01:28:59,240 --> 01:29:02,440
But when your ancestor couldn't
kill his son, he left clues.

783
01:29:04,040 --> 01:29:06,600
So that future generations
might do it for him.

784
01:29:06,680 --> 01:29:08,920
That must be what my father
was looking for in here.

785
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
Clues to the door's location.

786
01:29:11,160 --> 01:29:12,440
The door.

787
01:29:14,920 --> 01:29:16,040
Of course.

788
01:29:16,920 --> 01:29:18,360
You said your father spent hours...

789
01:29:18,440 --> 01:29:20,600
staring at this painting,
trying to find the lair.

790
01:29:20,680 --> 01:29:22,440
I think you were right.
Quite literally.

791
01:29:22,520 --> 01:29:25,560
I think this is the door.
He just didn't know how to open it.

792
01:29:25,640 --> 01:29:27,320
Look. A Latin inscription.

793
01:29:27,400 --> 01:29:29,560
CARL: Maybe it works
like the painting in the tower.

794
01:29:29,640 --> 01:29:33,240
If this were a door, my father
would have opened it long ago.

795
01:29:33,560 --> 01:29:37,000
I can't finish the inscription.
There's a piece missing.

796
01:29:42,600 --> 01:29:45,160
- Your father didn't have this.
- Where did you get that?

797
01:29:45,240 --> 01:29:46,760
VAN HELSING: Carl, finish it.

798
01:29:53,880 --> 01:29:56,520
In the name of God, open this door.

799
01:30:08,280 --> 01:30:09,480
A mirror.

800
01:30:09,960 --> 01:30:12,440
Dracula has no reflection
in the mirror.

801
01:30:12,520 --> 01:30:13,720
But why?

802
01:30:16,280 --> 01:30:19,080
Maybe, to Dracula
it's not a mirror at all.

803
01:30:38,920 --> 01:30:42,520
It's cold. And it's snowing.

804
01:30:47,560 --> 01:30:49,480
VAN HELSING: See you on the other side.

805
01:30:52,520 --> 01:30:53,880
Be careful.

806
01:31:34,120 --> 01:31:35,480
Castle Dracula.

807
01:32:24,480 --> 01:32:25,600
CARL: Do we have a plan?

808
01:32:25,680 --> 01:32:28,000
CARL: Doesn't have to be
Wellington's at Waterloo...

809
01:32:28,080 --> 01:32:29,280
but some sort of plan would be nice.

810
01:32:29,360 --> 01:32:30,960
VAN HELSING: We're going to stop Dracula.

811
01:32:31,040 --> 01:32:32,400
ANNA: And kill anything
in our way.

812
01:32:32,480 --> 01:32:34,480
CARL: Well, you let me know how that goes.

813
01:32:45,280 --> 01:32:47,520
Well, as grateful as I am
to be out of the cold...

814
01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:49,680
that doesn't seem like a good thing.

815
01:32:54,880 --> 01:32:56,720
We'd better get moving.

816
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:10,400
CARL: So are all of those...
ANNA: Yes.

817
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:12,560
- And inside them are...
- Yes.

818
01:33:12,640 --> 01:33:15,440
Igor do this! Lgor do that!

819
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:20,320
How did you find...
It's impossible!

820
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:27,360
- Please don't kill me!
- Why not?

821
01:33:28,480 --> 01:33:30,000
Well, I...

822
01:33:40,320 --> 01:33:42,480
My master has awakened.

823
01:34:02,720 --> 01:34:04,960
- There is a cure.
- What?

824
01:34:05,200 --> 01:34:09,200
Dracula. He has a cure to remove
the curse of the werewolf!

825
01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:14,560
Go, find the cure! Save yourself!

826
01:34:25,440 --> 01:34:27,200
ANNA: Come on. You heard him.
Let's find it.

827
01:34:27,280 --> 01:34:29,040
Wait. Why does Dracula have a cure?

828
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:31,280
- I don't care!
- I do.

829
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:34,240
Why does he need one? Why?

830
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:38,640
Because the only thing
that can kill him is a werewolf.

831
01:34:38,800 --> 01:34:40,240
The painting. That's what it meant.

832
01:34:40,320 --> 01:34:43,360
ANNA: Dracula's been using werewolves
to do his bidding for centuries.

833
01:34:43,440 --> 01:34:46,560
Yes, but if one ever had the will
to turn on him, he'd need a cure...

834
01:34:46,640 --> 01:34:49,680
to remove the curse and
make him human before it bit him.

835
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:52,240
You're going to take these two...

836
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:54,800
- And lead them to the antidote.
- No, I'm not.

837
01:34:55,840 --> 01:34:57,200
Yes, I am.

838
01:34:57,680 --> 01:35:00,240
Here's the plan. When the bell
begins to toll midnight...

839
01:35:00,320 --> 01:35:01,600
you'll be able to kill Dracula.

840
01:35:01,680 --> 01:35:03,040
We just need to find the cure...

841
01:35:03,120 --> 01:35:04,880
and get it into you
before the final stroke.

842
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:06,640
Are you insane?
What kind of plan is that?

843
01:35:06,720 --> 01:35:09,360
If they even suspect you
of misleading them...

844
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:10,880
clip off one of his fingers.

845
01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:13,120
- I'll clip off something.
- The tower over there...

846
01:35:13,200 --> 01:35:15,440
- That's where it is.
- And what about the other tower?

847
01:35:15,520 --> 01:35:16,880
- Give me that!
- That is where...

848
01:35:16,960 --> 01:35:20,160
we reassembled the laboratory.
Would I lie to you?

849
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:22,960
Not if you wanted to live.

850
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:27,600
Now, if I'm not cured by
the twelfth stroke of midnight...

851
01:35:30,960 --> 01:35:33,280
- I don't think I could.
- You must.

852
01:35:38,960 --> 01:35:40,160
Come on.

853
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:43,520
I don't like this plan.

854
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:46,160
We don't have a choice.
Just don't get killed.

855
01:35:46,400 --> 01:35:47,920
You still don't understand.

856
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,080
It doesn't matter
what happens to me.

857
01:35:50,240 --> 01:35:52,080
We must save my family.

858
01:35:52,560 --> 01:35:55,280
If you're late, run like hell.

859
01:35:59,360 --> 01:36:00,880
Don't be late.

860
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:16,320
Now go. Go.

861
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:43,520
FRANKENSTEIN: Get off me,
you vermin from hell!

862
01:36:47,040 --> 01:36:50,400
What are you complaining about?
This is why you were made!

863
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:54,480
To prove that God is not
the only one who can create life!

864
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:59,040
And now you must give that life
to my children.

865
01:36:59,680 --> 01:37:00,720
Up!

866
01:38:12,080 --> 01:38:13,600
There it is.

867
01:38:18,640 --> 01:38:20,240
I'll go first.

868
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:42,800
Carl!

869
01:38:45,360 --> 01:38:47,360
Stay as long as you like.

870
01:38:47,440 --> 01:38:50,080
You try to get lgor. Igor get you!

871
01:39:31,520 --> 01:39:35,680
- Go ahead. Grab it.
- You go ahead and grab it.

872
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:37,440
If there's one thing I've learned...

873
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:40,800
it's never to be the first to stick
your hand in a viscous material.

874
01:39:47,360 --> 01:39:50,320
- Did I scare you?
- No.

875
01:39:51,320 --> 01:39:54,720
Then maybe I need
to try a little harder.

876
01:40:01,800 --> 01:40:04,280
Viscous material!
What did I tell you?

877
01:40:04,440 --> 01:40:06,040
Get it!

878
01:40:14,520 --> 01:40:16,600
Hot.

879
01:40:16,680 --> 01:40:17,720
- Come on!
- Yes.

880
01:40:17,800 --> 01:40:21,160
We've got to get the antidote
to Van Helsing! Go!

881
01:40:24,120 --> 01:40:25,880
You can't go until I say you can go!

882
01:40:25,960 --> 01:40:27,480
Keep running, Carl!

883
01:40:28,600 --> 01:40:31,320
And I'll say you can go
when you're dead!

884
01:41:13,080 --> 01:41:14,520
CARL: Oh, my God!

885
01:41:43,320 --> 01:41:46,840
What are you doing?
You must find the cure!

886
01:41:46,920 --> 01:41:49,560
- My friends are doing it for me.
- Friends.

887
01:41:49,640 --> 01:41:51,320
Yes. You want one?

888
01:41:51,400 --> 01:41:53,880
I can't unscrew the bolts.
This is gonna hurt.

889
01:41:53,960 --> 01:41:55,800
I am accustomed to pain.

890
01:41:55,880 --> 01:41:57,560
It lets you know you're alive.

891
01:42:14,840 --> 01:42:16,920
Give me life!

892
01:42:31,560 --> 01:42:35,160
One more bolt
and my young will live.

893
01:42:48,120 --> 01:42:50,280
VAN HELSING: You're almost out, my friend!

894
01:45:02,360 --> 01:45:03,800
Help me!

895
01:45:04,360 --> 01:45:06,360
But you're supposed to die.

896
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,160
I want to live.

897
01:45:11,960 --> 01:45:13,320
All right!

898
01:45:18,440 --> 01:45:20,520
Be happy in the knowledge...

899
01:45:20,600 --> 01:45:24,440
that I shall weep
over your dead body.

900
01:45:28,440 --> 01:45:30,520
Hang on!

901
01:45:31,320 --> 01:45:33,560
I'll swing you loose!

902
01:46:06,120 --> 01:46:08,040
You are too late, my friend.

903
01:46:09,400 --> 01:46:11,240
My children live.

904
01:46:11,880 --> 01:46:15,080
Then the only way to kill them
is to kill you.

905
01:46:15,400 --> 01:46:16,600
Correct.

906
01:46:19,160 --> 01:46:20,440
So be it.

907
01:46:24,520 --> 01:46:25,560
One.

908
01:46:32,520 --> 01:46:34,680
No, this cannot be.

909
01:46:47,400 --> 01:46:50,440
We are both part of
the same grand game, Gabriel.

910
01:46:50,920 --> 01:46:54,600
But we need not find ourselves
on opposite sides of the board.

911
01:47:35,640 --> 01:47:37,640
[Aleera shrieks in pain]

912
01:47:39,800 --> 01:47:44,040
Go! Go and help Van Helsing!

913
01:47:47,880 --> 01:47:49,160
Now!

914
01:47:50,440 --> 01:47:51,800
Thank you.

915
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:21,600
Oh, my God!
Anna, I need a little help!

916
01:48:25,440 --> 01:48:26,560
Hurry!

917
01:48:36,720 --> 01:48:38,800
ANNA: Throw it to me, Carl!

918
01:48:45,360 --> 01:48:46,400
Yes!

919
01:49:06,640 --> 01:49:09,920
You are being used, Gabriel,
as was I.

920
01:49:10,400 --> 01:49:12,960
But I escaped. So can you.

921
01:49:54,080 --> 01:49:55,680
ALEERA: Anna, my love...

922
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:59,440
it is your blood
that shall keep me beautiful.

923
01:50:00,160 --> 01:50:02,160
What do you think of that?

924
01:50:06,160 --> 01:50:08,800
I think if you're going to
kill someone, kill them.

925
01:50:08,880 --> 01:50:10,960
Don't stand there talking about it.

926
01:50:34,320 --> 01:50:35,920
Don't you understand?

927
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:39,760
We could be friends. Partners!

928
01:50:41,120 --> 01:50:42,720
Brothers-in-arms!

929
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:16,320
Did I mention that it was you
who murdered me?

930
01:51:16,800 --> 01:51:20,400
It must be such a burden.
Such a curse...

931
01:51:21,360 --> 01:51:23,760
to be the Left Hand of God.

932
01:51:26,320 --> 01:51:28,960
All I want is life, Gabriel.

933
01:51:29,520 --> 01:51:31,600
The continuation of my kind.

934
01:51:32,400 --> 01:51:36,000
And perhaps the return of my ring.

935
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,800
Don't be afraid, Gabriel.
Don't be afraid.

936
01:51:44,240 --> 01:51:48,640
I shall give you back your life,
your memory.

937
01:51:49,920 --> 01:51:52,160
Some things
are better left forgotten.

938
01:52:24,400 --> 01:52:25,600
For God!

939
01:52:34,240 --> 01:52:35,680
God forgive me.

940
01:53:09,280 --> 01:53:10,640
She's dead.

941
01:54:05,920 --> 01:54:09,200
CARL: "Eternal rest grant unto her, "
Oh, Lord, and let perpetual light...

942
01:54:09,280 --> 01:54:11,600
"shine upon her.
On her soul and the souls of all...

943
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,720
"On her soul and the souls of all...

944
01:54:21,040 --> 01:54:24,240
"the dead faithful have mercy..."
