1
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:20,889
When a gentlegirl can win

2
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:24,726
prayer from out the lips of sin,

3
00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:28,108
when a child gives up tears

4
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:31,566
and the barren almond bears,

5
00:00:31,615 --> 00:00:36,826
when the silent chapel bell
sounds the ghostly sinners knell

6
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,408
then shall all the house be still

7
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:45,372
and peace shall come to Canterville.

8
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,022
Well, I guess you guys are just
starting back to school

9
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:57,564
after your summer vacation.

10
00:01:57,618 --> 00:02:00,234
And here I am in un-jolly old England,

11
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:01,697
cooped up with my mum and brothers

12
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:04,659
on my way to some place
nobody ever heard of.

13
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:09,452
My dad came over early to start
his research at the university.

14
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:13,247
Mum says the Grant he got
is some big deal,

15
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,133
the kind of thing that physicists
get all excited about,

16
00:02:16,178 --> 00:02:18,590
but I don't see why he had to drag
all of us along.

17
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:21,426
Ginny, don't look so grim.

18
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:25,889
You know, living in another country
can give you a whole new perspective.

19
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:29,809
If I don't die of boredom first.

20
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:39,569
Canterville next station.

21
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:41,358
Next stop Canterville.

22
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:43,618
Washington, wake up! We're here.

23
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:50,117
Oh, I can see dad.

24
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:55,914
- Dad!
- Hi!

25
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:58,128
- Dad!
- Hey, guys!

26
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,089
Haha! Hi!

27
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:02,754
Welcome to England.
Sorry about this crazy weather.

28
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:05,720
You can get four seasons in a day
here but it'll just blow over.

29
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:08,511
Hi. Guys, how was the trip?

30
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:09,643
The plane was bumpy

31
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:13,182
and Washington threw up in
one of those little bags.

32
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:14,520
Adam, spare the details.

33
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:16,981
- And how about London?
- We went to madame Tussauds.

34
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:21,148
They had this scary part,
with Jack the ripper and everybody.

35
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,532
We saw Hamlet in the west end.

36
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:23,817
Guys, this is Mr Umney.

37
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,111
Mr and Mrs Umney will be
taking care of us.

38
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:29,452
My family. My wife Lucille,
my daughter Virginia,

39
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:31,787
and these are my sons,
Washington and Adam.

40
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:33,168
Hi! How do you do?

41
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,044
Help Mr Umney with
the baggage, guys.

42
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,796
Honey, we have people
working for us?

43
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:38,628
You haven't seen anything yet.
Come on.

44
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:40,542
Ginny, you're going to love this place.

45
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:42,085
I can hardly wait.

46
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:48,475
Oh, wow! Is this for us?

47
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,885
Ginny!

48
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:54,977
Ha-ha!

49
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:57,142
Come on, boys,
climb in the back here.

50
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:16,287
Oh, that must be the new ones.

51
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,174
Morning!

52
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:52,538
Morning!

53
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,910
Up!

54
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:08,134
Whoa!

55
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,564
It's a castle!

56
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,066
It's a real castle!

57
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:21,226
Awesome!

58
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:24,692
Hi! Oh, honey!

59
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:29,030
Welcome to Canterville hall,
home for the next four months.

60
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:31,070
- What do you think, Ginny?
- It's old.

61
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:33,283
May I present Mrs Umney?

62
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,166
I bid you welcome to Canterville hall,
sir, madam.

63
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:38,873
- Hi.
- I'll see to the luggage.

64
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:40,537
And to the young mistress, welcome.

65
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:43,548
- Mistress? Ginny's a mistress?
- What are we?

66
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:45,208
You are the young masters.

67
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:47,799
- Masters?
- We're master?!

68
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:48,928
Look out!

69
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:51,465
Excuse me. Boys!

70
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:53,383
Boys...

71
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:56,519
- Cool!
- Awesome!

72
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:58,180
Terrific!

73
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:02,184
Some place, huh?

74
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:04,649
- Here!
- I'll get you!

75
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:06,529
- Guys, cut it out.
- Ow!

76
00:06:06,575 --> 00:06:08,315
Guys, get over here.

77
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,826
After you've had a chance
to get settled,

78
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:13,954
we'll be serving an early supper.

79
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:15,910
These are the lords of Canterville hall.

80
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,119
That's lord Henry.

81
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:19,910
You'll meet him tomorrow when
he comes down to sign the lease.

82
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:21,624
- Look!
- Hiram...

83
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:25,257
Hi, I don't see how we can afford this,
and the servants?

84
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:26,883
Well, it's dirt cheap.

85
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:29,135
These aristocratic families
are all going broke

86
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,920
and they have to rent
these places out.

87
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:32,885
And then there's the silly stories.

88
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:35,892
Stories? What kind of stories?

89
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:37,928
Nothing really.

90
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:45,644
Hello!

91
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:55,279
What was that?

92
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:57,288
Oh, pay no attention to that.

93
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:59,666
Just the wind. These old places make
a lot of noise.

94
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:01,042
Come on.

95
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:25,480
That was a wonderful meal,
Mr Umney.

96
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:27,234
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you, sir.

97
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,111
I'll tell Mrs Umney.

98
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:31,614
Ginny, you hardly ate anything.

99
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,025
It's too cold to eat.

100
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:36,070
Well, there wasn't exactly central
heating when this place was built.

101
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:39,410
- Right, Mr Umney?
- Quite right, sir.

102
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:43,702
I'd better go see
what those boys are doing.

103
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:45,541
They'll be fine. Let them play.

104
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:49,173
You going to bed so soon, Ginny?

105
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:52,052
Yeah. Maybe I'll get warm there.

106
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:54,588
- Good night, honey.
- Good night.

107
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,636
She just needs a little time.

108
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:02,725
I suppose.

109
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:20,489
What a stupid trick. You guys could
have broken my neck.

110
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:24,250
Agh!

111
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:27,583
Those two boys are whirling dervishes.

112
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:29,122
No discipline.

113
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:31,791
Not to worry. They won't last the night.

114
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:36,760
Yes. The old boy was at it with the
moaning as soon as they arrived.

115
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:39,094
Starved for attention, he is.

116
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:43,182
How long is it since the McKendricks?

117
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,687
Nearly two years.

118
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:47,099
I hear the poor woman is still
in the institution.

119
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:52,103
Good luck to them. That's all I say.

120
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:09,045
What was that?

121
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,672
Probably just the Umneys
closing up for the night.

122
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:13,254
Cheers!

123
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:20,302
Agh!

124
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:23,767
- Sh! Sh!
- What is it?

125
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:30,016
What is it?

126
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,026
Maybe it's a ghost.

127
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:40,031
Agh!

128
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:07,475
All right, you two.

129
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:28,283
Here, jerks.

130
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:50,021
So, how did everyone sleep
on their first night?

131
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:51,351
Hm?

132
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,192
Something wrong, guys?

133
00:10:58,241 --> 00:11:00,323
Didn't you hear it?

134
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:04,986
You heard it too?

135
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,449
It thumped at our door.

136
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,205
I thought it was you.

137
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:10,104
Well, there may have been
some noise in the hall

138
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:13,291
but I'm sure it was the Umneys closing
up. Isn't that right, Mr Umney?

139
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:14,545
Closing up?

140
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:17,583
- Oh, quite possibly, sir.
- There, see?

141
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:18,966
Nothing to lose any sleep over.

142
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:23,346
Now, guys, what do you say
we check this place out?

143
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:25,427
Come on. I'll give you
the two-dollar tour.

144
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:26,591
- Cool!
- Great!

145
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,723
Hey...

146
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:36,392
It's a new place, ok?

147
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:38,027
You'll get used to it.

148
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:40,613
What choice do I have?

149
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:50,828
The library is my favourite room.

150
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:53,289
Look at all these books!

151
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:55,954
Wow! Look at this!

152
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:58,623
- Be careful with that.
- What a wonderful room.

153
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:04,888
Look. This book contains the whole
history of the Cantervilles.

154
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:06,389
Wow!

155
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:10,018
Oh, look. Someone must have spilled
something here.

156
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:13,179
- Looks like blood.
- Oh, please!

157
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:15,815
- Oh, gross!
- Disgusting!

158
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,566
Maybe you ought to try to get it up.

159
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:19,694
Honey, you know in my carry-on bag

160
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,525
- there's the ch-ch.
- I know. The miracle.

161
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,405
- I'll go get it.
- Thanks, honey.

162
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:26,158
- Lucy.
- Mm-hm?

163
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:28,069
You don't need to clean that.

164
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:29,737
That's why we're paying Mrs Umney.

165
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,156
You know what I'm like.

166
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:46,637
- Umney!
- Morning, my lord.

167
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:49,140
- Are they still here?
- Yes, my lord.

168
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:53,349
Oh, lord Canterville, those two boys
are going to drive me mad, I swear.

169
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:56,435
Now, Mrs umney, we shall have to
make allowances,

170
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:58,190
things being what they are.

171
00:12:58,236 --> 00:13:02,479
- Any trouble?
- Only... noises so far, my lord.

172
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:07,071
Well, at least they lasted
the first night.

173
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:13,031
- With deference, sir, lord Canterville.
- Ha ha!

174
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:15,746
There... gone.

175
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,503
Oh!

176
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:29,681
That stain, Mrs Otis, was the blood of
lady Eleanore de Canterville,

177
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:33,844
who died on that very spot in 1584.

178
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:38,606
It has been the wonder of the county
for 400 years.

179
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:43,441
And until today has resisted all efforts
at removal.

180
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:46,026
Well, I didn't know it was so special.

181
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:50,610
Mrs umney...

182
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:53,370
Are you all right?

183
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:54,826
I suppose so.

184
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:57,242
Oh, Mrs umney, I'm so sorry.

185
00:13:57,295 --> 00:14:01,288
Oh, Mark me, this bodes ill.

186
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:04,378
Mrs umney, we don't believe
in such things.

187
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:06,167
You'll see.

188
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:11,055
I have seen things with my own eyes.

189
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,183
I have seen things happen
in this house.

190
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:17,429
May Providence watch over you.

191
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:24,482
Um... this is Henry, lord Canterville.

192
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,270
Lord Canterville, my family.

193
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:28,815
- My wife Lucille.
- How do you do?

194
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,234
- How do you do?
- My daughter Virginia.

195
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:33,323
Oh, Virginia, how do you do?

196
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:35,830
And these two rascals are my sons,
Washington and Adam.

197
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,082
- Pleased to meet you.
- How did she die?

198
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:41,460
That lady Eleanore.
Did somebody kill her?

199
00:14:41,506 --> 00:14:42,791
No one knows.

200
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:47,709
Her husband, my unfortunate ancestor
Simon de Canterville,

201
00:14:47,762 --> 00:14:52,051
disappeared mysteriously
after her death.

202
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:55,092
- His body has never been recovered.
- Wow!

203
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:59,478
But his spirit has haunted this hall
ever since.

204
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:02,853
- It was a ghost!
- Awesome!

205
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,518
All right, guys, that's enough.
Go outside and play.

206
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:08,779
- Say goodbye to lord Canterville.
- Goodbye, lads.

207
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:10,781
- Bye!
- Bye!

208
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:16,154
Lord Canterville, with all due respect,
sir, the laws of physics

209
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:20,041
are not going to be repealed even for
the British aristocracy.

210
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:23,578
You may think anything you like,
Mr Otis.

211
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:27,044
Only you must remember
that I warned you.

212
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:29,584
- Hm? The lease.
- Thank you.

213
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,719
Hiram, before we sign anything,

214
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:34,005
- don't you think...
- We consider ourselves warned.

215
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:37,425
We are happy, lord Canterville...

216
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:41,187
To be leasing the hall, ghost and all,
until next June.

217
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:42,517
Thank you.

218
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:45,149
Thank you, Mr Otis, and Mrs Otis.

219
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:46,934
And Virginia, of course.

220
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:48,478
Ginny?

221
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:50,567
We're saying goodbye
to lord Canterville.

222
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:51,776
Oh, bye.

223
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:55,660
Goodbye. You must come to dinner
with me one evening.

224
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:57,866
Goodbye, all. Thank you very much.

225
00:15:57,915 --> 00:15:59,280
Thank you.

226
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:52,129
So you've found the prophecy,
have you?

227
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:53,839
Is that what it is?

228
00:16:55,056 --> 00:16:56,762
A prophecy about what?

229
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:59,219
I couldn't say for certain.

230
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:00,929
Is it about the ghost?

231
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:04,061
I don't involve myself in such things.

232
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:08,099
Not like Mrs umney.

233
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,582
Looks like the storm will last the night.

234
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:27,960
I wonder if he'll come again.

235
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:30,542
Now, wash, like I've told you,
there are no ghosts.

236
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:32,297
But lord Canterville said...

237
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:34,675
The universe operates on certain
fixed principles.

238
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,302
Now, I admit we don't understand
them all yet.

239
00:17:37,348 --> 00:17:41,808
And sometimes we call the things
we don't understand "supernatural".

240
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:45,720
But eventually, there will be a natural
explanation for everything.

241
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:52,520
So, guys, up until then put your faith
in science, not superstition.

242
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:53,607
Well, we all heard it.

243
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:56,272
I know some of us say that we heard
something, Ginny.

244
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:59,032
And I also know that some of us
would like nothing more

245
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,865
than to turn this family around
and go back home.

246
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:04,701
That's not going to happen, ok?

247
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:09,540
So finish your supper and
stop scaring your brothers.

248
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:11,671
There are no ghosts.

249
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:11,810
Hey, guys, help!

250
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:15,522
I'm stuck in this grungy old house
my dad rented for us.

251
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:18,404
There's nothing to do and
nobody for miles around

252
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:22,112
except these two spooky old people
that take care of the place.

253
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:25,619
And on top of it,
I think the place is haunted.

254
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:31,326
At first I thought it was just
my stupid brothers

255
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:34,337
but now I think maybe something
is really going on.

256
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:37,590
Of course my dad,
the brilliant physicist,

257
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:40,627
refuses to believe it could be
a ghost and blames it all on me.

258
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,261
As usual.

259
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:51,349
Washington, Adam.

260
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:53,560
You guys better cut this out.

261
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:20,633
Have at you, sir ghost.

262
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:24,087
Agh!

263
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,381
Leave them alone, you big bully!

264
00:20:27,685 --> 00:20:30,472
Guys, what are you doing?

265
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:32,352
It's him!

266
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:37,016
- Who? What are you talking about?
- He's right there.

267
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,413
There's no one there.

268
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:01,628
Are you all right?

269
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:04,919
We're fine, Mrs umney. It's just
a prank that got a little out of hand.

270
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:06,758
I wouldn't be so sure.

271
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:09,970
Let us not meddle, Mrs umney.

272
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:12,852
Come along, my dear. Beddy-byes.

273
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:18,307
Ginny, I don't want you scaring
your little brothers any more.

274
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,773
Now, it was a good joke,
but enough is enough.

275
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:23,232
But he was there.

276
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,364
Guys, I know you think
you saw something

277
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:28,651
but it was probably just the lightning
and your imagination

278
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,365
with a lot of help from your sister.

279
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:31,950
How can you say that?

280
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:34,957
Virginia, I know you don't want to be
here any more.

281
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:38,210
Well, I'm sorry.
I can't do anything about that.

282
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:42,498
But you are not going to make the rest
of our lives miserable.

283
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:45,668
Now, everybody get back to bed.

284
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:48,679
And you guys put that stuff back in
the kitchen tomorrow morning.

285
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:52,265
Hiram...

286
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,142
Lucy, come on.

287
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:56,770
We're sorry, Ginny, honest.

288
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:02,063
It's ok, mum. Let him think
what he wants.

289
00:22:05,783 --> 00:22:08,741
Maybe the wind blew something over
or the lightning cast a shadow.

290
00:22:08,786 --> 00:22:11,118
You know it's a strange place.
Your eyes play tricks.

291
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,448
Yeah, that must have been it.

292
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:13,988
Come on, Lucy.

293
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:18,875
Things'll be better in the morning.

294
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:20,377
Night night.

295
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:23,255
- Don't let the bed bugs bite.
- Bed bugs bite, right!

296
00:22:28,389 --> 00:22:30,220
Some bed bug.

297
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:43,483
Good morning.

298
00:22:44,822 --> 00:22:46,608
Morning, madam.

299
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:49,490
Maybe the rain will help
this poor thing.

300
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:51,526
Doesn't show any buds.

301
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:54,537
It's been like that ever since...

302
00:22:54,582 --> 00:22:56,789
As long as anyone can remember,
madam.

303
00:22:56,834 --> 00:22:58,745
So why don't you take it out?

304
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:02,332
Lord Canterville's orders.
It's not to be disturbed.

305
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:04,246
- Odd!
- Mr umney.

306
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,881
I'm just going into town.

307
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:07,336
I'll get the car for you, sir.

308
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:09,342
No, no, that's all right.
I'll drive myself.

309
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:13,097
No! No, no, no trouble at all, sir.

310
00:23:14,685 --> 00:23:16,516
Honey, before you go,

311
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:18,223
I'm worried about Ginny.

312
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:21,184
Maybe she really did see something
last night.

313
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:22,723
Oh, Lucy.

314
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:26,439
It's just her way of getting back at us
for taking her away from her friends.

315
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:28,399
And the worst thing we could
possibly do

316
00:23:28,449 --> 00:23:31,156
is let her think we could be
frightened into going home.

317
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:32,987
No telling what she'd do then.

318
00:23:33,037 --> 00:23:34,402
Maybe.

319
00:23:34,455 --> 00:23:36,662
But there were all those weird noises.

320
00:23:36,707 --> 00:23:37,947
What noises?

321
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,911
Just the power of suggestion.

322
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,666
Don't let her suck you in.

323
00:23:41,712 --> 00:23:43,623
Remember, like I say, everything has...

324
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:46,288
Everything has a rational explanation.
Yeah, I know.

325
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:49,926
Good. Get her out, make some friends,
meet the neighbours.

326
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,801
She'll be fine. You'll see.

327
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:53,929
I hope you're right.

328
00:23:56,185 --> 00:23:58,972
- Morning, miss.
- Hi. Mrs umney...

329
00:23:59,021 --> 00:24:01,307
This is sir Simon, isn't it?

330
00:24:01,357 --> 00:24:06,442
Why yes! Fine figure of a man.

331
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:09,978
That look on his face.

332
00:24:10,032 --> 00:24:11,613
What do you think he's feeling?

333
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:14,446
Seems pretty fierce.

334
00:24:14,495 --> 00:24:16,235
Yeah.

335
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:20,535
But there's something else too.

336
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:24,372
Well, now that you mention it, yes.

337
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:28,084
Maybe... a little sad perhaps.

338
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,794
And lonely.

339
00:24:31,387 --> 00:24:33,002
Yes.

340
00:24:34,348 --> 00:24:35,758
Perhaps so.

341
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:52,195
Agh!

342
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:54,405
Mum!

343
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:55,782
What is it, boys?

344
00:24:55,828 --> 00:24:58,444
- Look!
- I saw it first.

345
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:01,284
Oh, no! I thought we had it up.

346
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,745
I think the ghost just got mad and
killed somebody else

347
00:25:03,794 --> 00:25:05,409
and spilled their blood right here.

348
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:06,998
Honey, there isn't any ghost.

349
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:08,708
Well, somebody made it come back.

350
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:10,918
Well, we'll just have to clean it up
again.

351
00:25:11,969 --> 00:25:13,505
What is it?

352
00:25:13,554 --> 00:25:15,886
It's nothing.
Would you go get the cleaner?

353
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:17,296
Yes, mum.

354
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:21,391
We may have to start keeping
this room locked up.

355
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:39,277
He comes back into the bar
with a third ferret and he says...

356
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:40,944
What?

357
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:44,740
Hello.

358
00:25:46,754 --> 00:25:48,164
Hi.

359
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:49,498
Hello.

360
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:50,958
Hello.

361
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:55,092
I'm Hiram Otis. My family and I are
renting Canterville hall.

362
00:25:57,306 --> 00:26:00,764
And I was wondering if you could
direct me to the post office, please.

363
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:03,095
That be here. I'm the postman.

364
00:26:03,145 --> 00:26:05,101
Oh, thank you.

365
00:26:05,147 --> 00:26:08,139
And what about the local police station
in case of emergency?

366
00:26:08,192 --> 00:26:11,059
That be here too. I'm the constable
when one is needed.

367
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:14,069
As a constable you're a better
postman!

368
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:21,155
- Telephone exchange?
- Aye.

369
00:26:22,164 --> 00:26:24,530
Then what about a doctor?

370
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:27,620
Well, I'm the local vet
if that's any good.

371
00:26:28,629 --> 00:26:32,713
Thank you. That's all very compact
and convenient.

372
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:35,295
I'll be back soon, I'm sure.

373
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:37,710
You can count on it.

374
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:51,857
Seems a nice enough sort, eh?

375
00:26:51,902 --> 00:26:53,233
How long do you give 'em?

376
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:55,439
They've already lasted much longer
than most.

377
00:26:55,489 --> 00:26:58,731
Well, I've got a fiver that says they're
gone in a week at the outside.

378
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:01,116
- Make it a tenner.
- Fiver!

379
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:02,776
Put me down for twenty.

380
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:05,617
- Ooh, twenty!
- Oh!

381
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:34,315
Hello.

382
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:35,726
Hello.

383
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:37,770
Mind if I look?

384
00:27:37,823 --> 00:27:39,404
Suit yourself.

385
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:41,690
It's really very good.

386
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:44,068
Oh, it's just a sketch.

387
00:27:44,121 --> 00:27:46,703
I'm Francis Stilton.
How do you do?

388
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:48,534
Oh, Virginia Otis.

389
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:50,040
We're renting Canterville hall.

390
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:51,746
- Yeah, I know. I...
- Oh?

391
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:53,160
I saw you the day you arrived.

392
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:55,124
Oh. I don't remember.

393
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:58,007
Actually, the whole district is talking
about you.

394
00:27:58,051 --> 00:28:00,588
Really? What do they say?

395
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:04,676
Oh, they just wonder how long
you'll be staying here in England.

396
00:28:04,725 --> 00:28:06,340
Oh. We're just staying till June.

397
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:08,133
You live around here?

398
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:09,893
I'm your nearest neighbour.

399
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:13,226
Cheshire chase just on the other
side of the pine wood.

400
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:17,400
Are you enjoying your visit?

401
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:18,856
Not exactly.

402
00:28:18,906 --> 00:28:20,567
I suppose you miss your friends.

403
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:23,940
Yeah, I do.

404
00:28:23,994 --> 00:28:25,450
Boyfriend especially.

405
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:29,238
Oh, I don't exactly have
a boyfriend especially.

406
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:33,538
What a pity. I mean... I'm surprised.

407
00:28:33,587 --> 00:28:37,330
- That's all. A beautiful girl like you.
- Yeah, sure.

408
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:39,293
So how do you like Canterville hall?

409
00:28:39,343 --> 00:28:43,712
Oh. Let's just say it's peculiar.
You ever been there?

410
00:28:43,764 --> 00:28:45,595
Used to go there a lot.

411
00:28:45,641 --> 00:28:48,132
Years ago, when the Cantervilles were
still here.

412
00:28:48,185 --> 00:28:52,394
I wonder if it's changed much.

413
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:56,731
Oh, well, why don't you come over
and see for yourself?

414
00:28:57,861 --> 00:28:59,772
I... I'd be delighted.

415
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:03,230
How about tonight?

416
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:06,946
Sure. How about dinner? Seven?

417
00:29:08,205 --> 00:29:10,787
Right. See you then.

418
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:12,163
Ok.

419
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:18,245
I can't believe I did that.

420
00:29:30,394 --> 00:29:31,930
I'm fine.

421
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:40,983
- Hi, honey.
- Hi, hon.

422
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:43,399
How was town?

423
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:45,905
Well, the pub does everything but
deliver babies

424
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:47,566
but I didn't ask them about that.

425
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,405
Everything ok here?

426
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:52,867
Yes, fine. The boys have been out
exploring and Ginny went out painting.

427
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:55,032
Oh, we've got some time to ourselves.

428
00:29:55,085 --> 00:29:56,791
- We can relax a bit.
- Yeah.

429
00:29:56,837 --> 00:29:58,702
Hey.

430
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:02,418
I met a neighbour and invited him to
dinner tonight, ok?

431
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:04,332
- Sure.
- That's great!

432
00:30:04,386 --> 00:30:06,968
- I'll tell Mrs umney.
- Thanks.

433
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:11,889
See? Told you she'd be fine.

434
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:13,766
Yeah, hi, you know that stain
on the floor?

435
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,768
- It was there again this morning.
- Really?

436
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:18,100
And it smelled a little like oil paint.

437
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,890
But it's ok. I got it up again.

438
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:23,481
Well, maybe we'd better start keeping
that door locked at night just in case.

439
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:24,986
Yeah. Good idea.

440
00:31:01,485 --> 00:31:03,771
When a gentlegirl can win...

441
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:07,313
Prayer from out the lips of sin...

442
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:11,490
When a child gives up tears...

443
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:15,195
And the barren almond bears.

444
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:18,619
When the silent chapel bell

445
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:21,080
sounds the ghostly sinners knell,

446
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:23,871
then shall all the house be still

447
00:31:23,924 --> 00:31:26,006
and peace shall come to Canterville.

448
00:31:30,097 --> 00:31:32,008
They're the same.

449
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:48,855
When a gentlegirl can win
prayer from out the lips of sin,

450
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:51,740
when a child gives up tears

451
00:31:51,785 --> 00:31:53,992
and the barren almond bears...

452
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:59,619
When the silent chapel bell
sounds the ghostly sinners knell

453
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:03,832
then shall all the house be still
and peace shall come to Canterville.

454
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:23,448
It is the star to every wandering bark

455
00:33:23,502 --> 00:33:26,915
whose worth's unknown,

456
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:28,794
although his height be taken.

457
00:33:31,301 --> 00:33:34,384
Love's not time's fool,

458
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:37,171
though rosy lips and cheeks

459
00:33:37,224 --> 00:33:40,887
within his bending sickle's
compass come.

460
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:46,772
Love alters not with his brief hours
and weeks

461
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:53,062
but bears it out even to the edge
of doom.

462
00:33:55,909 --> 00:34:00,243
If this be error and upon me proved,

463
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:06,454
I never writ, nor no man ever loved.

464
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:23,717
How darest thou?

465
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:25,761
I'm sorry, I was just looking.

466
00:34:25,814 --> 00:34:28,021
Be gone! Away!

467
00:34:57,971 --> 00:35:00,132
- Evening, umney.
- Good evening, your grace.

468
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:01,546
It's been a long time.

469
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,215
Too long, your grace.

470
00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:05,850
Listen, umney, I'm not a Duke.

471
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:07,180
Not a Duke?

472
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,936
Just for this evening.

473
00:35:08,982 --> 00:35:10,722
Very good, your grace.

474
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:16,444
- Sir, madam.
- Hello.

475
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:17,854
I'm Virginia's mother.

476
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:19,317
Pleased to meet you, Mrs Otis.

477
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:21,449
I'm Francis Stilton,
and this must be Mr Otis.

478
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:22,950
Indeed. It's nice to meet you.

479
00:35:22,996 --> 00:35:26,284
And these are our two sons,
Washington and Adam.

480
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:29,166
- Francis Stilton.
- Hello.

481
00:35:31,046 --> 00:35:36,291
And... I guess you already met
our daughter Virginia.

482
00:35:36,343 --> 00:35:37,924
Hello.

483
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:39,334
Yes, hello.

484
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:44,631
Madam, dinner will be served
almost at once.

485
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:46,970
Your grace.

486
00:35:48,021 --> 00:35:49,056
Umney.

487
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:51,892
He called you "your grace”.

488
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:54,102
Well, yes, technically that's what I am.

489
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:55,892
A lord?

490
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:59,433
Well, as a matter of fact,
I'm the fourth Duke of Cheshire.

491
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:03,071
- Really?
- You don't look that old.

492
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:08,204
Well, you see, my parents died in
an accident when I was very young

493
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:09,455
and I inherited.

494
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:10,832
I'm so sorry.

495
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:13,584
So what do we call you then?
Your grace?

496
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:15,712
Oh, please, just call me Francis.

497
00:36:15,757 --> 00:36:17,918
Or whatever you like.

498
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:22,461
Madam, Mrs umney informs me that
dinner will be served immediately.

499
00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:23,549
Thank you.

500
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:26,806
Good. Let's not stand on ceremony.
Let's sit down and eat.

501
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:28,216
Boys?

502
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:41,897
So... Francis, you must know
this place pretty well.

503
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:45,067
Well, I haven't been here
since the Cantervilles left

504
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,361
but it hasn't changed at all.

505
00:36:47,414 --> 00:36:48,950
- You know about the ghost too?
- Adam!

506
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:51,205
That's all right. In fact, I do know about
the ghost.

507
00:36:51,251 --> 00:36:52,707
I mean everyone around here does.

508
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:55,494
Well, we take it with a rather large
grain of salt.

509
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:57,333
Except those of us who've seen him.

510
00:36:57,382 --> 00:36:58,417
Yeah!

511
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:01,424
Come on, we don't want to bore
Francis.

512
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:03,960
Not at all, no.
In fact, I've seen him too.

513
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:05,344
Really?

514
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:08,848
Well, I suppose every place has
its superstitions,

515
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:10,053
its mass hallucinations.

516
00:37:10,103 --> 00:37:11,843
And the blood stain?
You've seen that?

517
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:14,012
Years ago I saw it, yes.

518
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:16,056
- It's gone now.
- It's gone?

519
00:37:16,109 --> 00:37:18,566
But no one's ever been able
to remove that.

520
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:21,148
Mum cleaned it up with stain remover.

521
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:24,280
It came back once
but we got it this time.

522
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:26,657
- Yeah. Come on, we'll show you.
- Guys!

523
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:28,443
Hang on a minute, guys.

524
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:31,659
Oh, no, not at all.
In fact, I'd like to see it.

525
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:34,199
Good. Come on.

526
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:40,797
We've been keeping this door locked

527
00:37:40,842 --> 00:37:43,879
in case anyone wanted to tamper with
the stain again.

528
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:52,801
Now it's green!

529
00:37:52,854 --> 00:37:54,390
I know the door was locked.

530
00:37:57,942 --> 00:38:00,308
Oil paint all right.

531
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:03,103
And I guess we all know
where that came from.

532
00:38:03,156 --> 00:38:04,646
What?

533
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:06,815
Not now, Hiram.

534
00:38:06,868 --> 00:38:09,610
I don't know how you managed to get
in here, young lady.

535
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:11,448
But this is in very poor taste.

536
00:38:11,498 --> 00:38:12,533
Dad...

537
00:38:12,582 --> 00:38:15,289
Let's discuss this later.

538
00:38:15,335 --> 00:38:17,542
Francis, I know you have to get home.

539
00:38:17,587 --> 00:38:20,670
Yes, of course.
I ought to be getting back.

540
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:23,422
Thank you for a wonderful meal.

541
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:25,004
Your coat.

542
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:26,634
Yes, thank you.

543
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:30,380
Go say goodbye.

544
00:38:33,061 --> 00:38:35,268
Bed in ten minutes.

545
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:39,059
Do you think Ginny did it?

546
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:40,473
No way.

547
00:38:40,527 --> 00:38:41,812
It was him all right.

548
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:44,398
Green blood? He's making fun of us.

549
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:45,562
Yeah.

550
00:38:45,615 --> 00:38:50,154
But he won't get away with it
this time because I've got an idea.

551
00:38:50,203 --> 00:38:52,239
Yeah!

552
00:38:55,917 --> 00:38:58,249
What was all that about?

553
00:38:58,294 --> 00:39:00,956
Francis, have you really seen
the ghost

554
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:02,996
or were you just saying that
to defend me?

555
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:04,664
No, no, I really saw him.

556
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:06,958
It was about six years ago.

557
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:10,128
We were visiting, playing croquet
on the lawn.

558
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:14,265
Just after sunset, he appeared
right there, by that tree.

559
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:17,302
He was playing ninepins
with his own bones.

560
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:19,892
My aunt fainted dead away.

561
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:22,808
Well, the ghost has been doing stuff
like that to us too.

562
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:26,729
But my dad's a big-shot scientist who
can't bring himself to think it's a ghost

563
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:28,146
so he blames it all on me.

564
00:39:29,659 --> 00:39:31,024
I'm sorry.

565
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:33,614
Yeah, thanks.

566
00:39:33,663 --> 00:39:35,324
What are you going to do?

567
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:38,206
I don't know but I'm going to do
something.

568
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:42,960
Be careful.

569
00:39:43,006 --> 00:39:44,291
I will.

570
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,126
Virginia?

571
00:39:55,143 --> 00:39:56,724
How about tomorrow?

572
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:58,930
I think I can find the time.

573
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:15,152
And the barren almond bears.

574
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:29,841
Ah, Gabriel, do they retire
to their beds?

575
00:40:29,886 --> 00:40:31,592
Splendid.

576
00:40:37,727 --> 00:40:41,311
I was beset by two upstart boys,

577
00:40:41,356 --> 00:40:44,223
denigrated by a little sniff of a girl,

578
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:48,939
and, indignity upon indignity,
ignored by their parents.

579
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:52,071
Well, I will tonight a special
effort make.

580
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:56,989
First will I to the parents' room,

581
00:40:57,038 --> 00:40:59,529
there to lay a clammy hand upon
the woman's brow,

582
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:02,665
while I whisper in her trembling
husband's ear

583
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:05,326
the awful secrets of the Charnel house.

584
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:08,122
Then to the boys where...

585
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:10,881
I will gibber...

586
00:41:10,927 --> 00:41:14,260
And stab myself thrice in the throat.

587
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:16,967
Then turn I to the girl.

588
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:20,429
For her, I will do such things.

589
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:25,268
What they are yet I know not, but
they shall be the terrors of the earth.

590
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:30,276
The bell invites me.

591
00:41:35,243 --> 00:41:38,610
Gabriel, thou hast the storm forgot.

592
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:42,618
Blow winds! Crack your cheeks.

593
00:41:46,254 --> 00:41:48,711
Thanks, my trusty familiar.

594
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:53,628
And now, to work.

595
00:41:53,678 --> 00:41:56,294
Perchance a grand entrance.

596
00:42:09,986 --> 00:42:11,977
A thousand pardons.

597
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:18,491
Pray, proceed.

598
00:42:21,706 --> 00:42:22,946
A ghost!

599
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:25,831
Another ghost!

600
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:29,961
And such a one.
It Rose like a colossus.

601
00:42:30,006 --> 00:42:32,918
And in its hand, an Ethiope's dagger.

602
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:38,382
And from its eyes, there streamed
demonic light.

603
00:42:38,431 --> 00:42:41,764
Gabriel, think you could somehow
manage that ourselves?

604
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:43,470
It had a most chilling effect.

605
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:46,261
And now, methinks...

606
00:42:46,314 --> 00:42:51,024
We might turn this appearance
to our advantage.

607
00:42:52,153 --> 00:42:58,149
If he would... join with us against
these ameri-cans,

608
00:42:58,201 --> 00:43:02,319
surely as a fellow ghost,
he would feel some kinship.

609
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:04,532
Blood is thicker than water.

610
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:07,289
Although to us that is not entirely apt.

611
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:13,504
I'll after her and appeal
to his ghostly honour.

612
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:15,710
There's yet time before dawn.

613
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:26,225
Hail and well met, sir ghost.

614
00:43:27,522 --> 00:43:31,891
I bid you a hearty welcome to
Canterville hall.

615
00:43:31,943 --> 00:43:37,438
I am sir Simon de Canterville,
the resident spectre.

616
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:41,653
But setting all chat aside,

617
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:46,913
wouldst join with me in an alliance,
ghost to ghost?

618
00:43:54,966 --> 00:44:00,461
"Ye Otis ghost, true and original.
Beware of imitations."

619
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:25,075
Duped!

620
00:44:25,121 --> 00:44:26,861
Mocked!

621
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:28,654
Ridiculed!

622
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:42,794
Now, by the bones of my ancestors,
I swear,

623
00:44:42,847 --> 00:44:44,838
when twice the cock hath called
the sun,

624
00:44:44,891 --> 00:44:48,349
deeds of blood shall be done
upon your heads.

625
00:44:49,812 --> 00:44:54,306
Yet crow again and cry havoc,
murder shall walk abroad.

626
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:58,480
Yet crow again, and cry havoc!

627
00:44:59,989 --> 00:45:02,071
Perdition take the naughty fowl.

628
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:05,779
I have seen the day when,
with my good strong spear,

629
00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:08,991
I'd have made him call for me
and 'twere in death.

630
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:11,201
Take thou this.

631
00:45:20,593 --> 00:45:21,958
Hey, that could have been us.

632
00:45:22,011 --> 00:45:24,798
Come on, let's see what a big,
brave ghost can do

633
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:26,929
to a girl and two little boys. I dare you.

634
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:33,015
Why must I be afflicted by these
ameri-cans?!

635
00:45:36,317 --> 00:45:38,182
What on earth is going on?

636
00:45:41,489 --> 00:45:43,275
- What is this?
- Are you all right?

637
00:45:43,324 --> 00:45:44,564
We're ok.

638
00:45:44,617 --> 00:45:46,949
This is the last straw, young lady.

639
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:49,201
- What?
- Somebody could've been hurt.

640
00:45:49,247 --> 00:45:51,738
- You could've burned the place down.
- That's enough.

641
00:45:51,791 --> 00:45:54,954
Ok... you win.

642
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:57,914
Soon as I can arrange it,
you are going back to Indiana

643
00:45:57,964 --> 00:46:00,046
- to live with your aunt Lydia.
- Dad...

644
00:46:00,091 --> 00:46:02,252
Hope you're happy now.

645
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:03,757
Mum...

646
00:46:03,803 --> 00:46:06,840
Ginny, I think your father's right
this time.

647
00:46:10,518 --> 00:46:13,430
We didn't mean to do
anything wrong, Ginny.

648
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:17,643
We were just trying to give him
a dose of his own medicine.

649
00:46:22,571 --> 00:46:24,436
Well, sir Simon...

650
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:26,071
I hope you're satisfied.

651
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:57,978
Virginia, you're riding like the devil's
after you.

652
00:46:58,024 --> 00:46:59,639
Maybe he is.

653
00:46:59,692 --> 00:47:01,148
I know a place we can talk.

654
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:11,697
I used to come here when I was little.
It's my favourite place.

655
00:47:17,168 --> 00:47:19,124
It's like I've been here before.

656
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:20,455
What's wrong?

657
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:24,580
My parents are going
to send me home.

658
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:27,504
Oh.

659
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:30,089
Why?

660
00:47:30,139 --> 00:47:33,927
My brothers got the ghost mad
this morning, they really let loose.

661
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:37,343
And my dad thinks
I was trying to blow the place up.

662
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:41,856
He thinks I've been trying to scare
the family into going home, but...

663
00:47:41,901 --> 00:47:43,607
But what?

664
00:47:49,742 --> 00:47:51,482
But now I don't want to leave.

665
00:47:52,745 --> 00:47:56,954
I mean, it's weird cos at first
I hated coming here,

666
00:47:56,999 --> 00:47:58,785
but now...

667
00:48:00,503 --> 00:48:02,209
Now I feel I belong.

668
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:08,544
I feel that, too.

669
00:48:15,768 --> 00:48:18,009
Maybe there's some way to convince
your parents.

670
00:48:18,062 --> 00:48:20,144
Maybe they'll see the ghost
for themselves.

671
00:48:20,189 --> 00:48:22,020
No. Neither of them can see him.

672
00:48:22,066 --> 00:48:24,227
I mean, he was standing right
in the middle of the hall

673
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:25,937
and my dad walked straight
through him.

674
00:48:25,986 --> 00:48:29,854
They say that in order to see ghosts,
you have to believe in them.

675
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:32,569
But everyone around here can see him
without any trouble.

676
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:35,530
We grew up with ghosts.
Our history's full of them.

677
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:42,082
So it's a catch-22 then.

678
00:48:42,128 --> 00:48:46,041
My parents don't believe because
they can't see him,

679
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:48,752
and they can't see him because
they don't believe.

680
00:48:48,801 --> 00:48:49,916
I'm afraid so.

681
00:48:51,095 --> 00:48:53,882
But if they did believe,
then they could see him.

682
00:48:55,724 --> 00:48:57,555
That's it!

683
00:48:57,601 --> 00:48:59,137
Wish me luck, Francis.

684
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:00,551
Virginia!

685
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:30,293
- I really have to talk to you.
- No. You have no right here.

686
00:49:30,342 --> 00:49:33,129
- And you have no right to ruin my life.
- What?

687
00:49:33,179 --> 00:49:35,591
All that moaning and rattling
and thumping,

688
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:37,095
my dad blames me for all that.

689
00:49:37,141 --> 00:49:39,348
You've used an awful lot
of my good oil paints

690
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:42,247
for that dumb bloodstain of yours, and
of course he blames me for that too

691
00:49:42,271 --> 00:49:44,808
and that blast this morning,
scaring my brothers half to death.

692
00:49:44,857 --> 00:49:46,848
That really tore it.

693
00:49:46,901 --> 00:49:50,735
And now, just when I meet someone
I really like and I want to stay,

694
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:52,770
my dad is sending me home.

695
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:54,905
And he's sending me home
on account of you.

696
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:57,111
But I knew not.

697
00:49:57,161 --> 00:49:59,948
I must rattle my chains
and groan through keyholes

698
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:02,283
and walk abroad at night.
I have no choice.

699
00:50:02,333 --> 00:50:03,743
Why not?

700
00:50:03,792 --> 00:50:05,032
That concerns you not.

701
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:08,623
It does when you're ruining my life.
Sir Simon...

702
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:10,788
You have to help me.
You have to make him believe.

703
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:12,377
What?

704
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:14,257
He doesn't believe in ghosts.

705
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:18,797
Doesn't... believe?

706
00:50:23,062 --> 00:50:25,303
He has ignored me quite.

707
00:50:25,356 --> 00:50:28,473
In four centuries of haunting,
I have never been treated so.

708
00:50:28,526 --> 00:50:33,145
Your father did, without a care,
amble through my person.

709
00:50:33,197 --> 00:50:35,984
That's because he couldn't see you.

710
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:40,197
Francis says that because he doesn't
believe in you, he can't see you.

711
00:50:42,373 --> 00:50:44,910
Gabriel, that would explain it!

712
00:50:46,335 --> 00:50:48,576
I was afeared that I was losing
my powers.

713
00:50:48,629 --> 00:50:50,210
Oh, no. I thought you were wonderful.

714
00:50:52,341 --> 00:50:53,877
- Didst thou?
- Yes.

715
00:50:53,926 --> 00:50:55,632
I don't usually scream.

716
00:50:55,678 --> 00:50:58,795
I mean roller coasters and
scary movies, not a peep.

717
00:50:58,847 --> 00:51:01,714
But when you came in that first time,
well, you heard me.

718
00:51:02,851 --> 00:51:05,308
A most gratifying scream.

719
00:51:07,356 --> 00:51:10,223
Anyways, if we can make him see you,
then he'll have to believe.

720
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:14,063
Zounds!

721
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:18,940
Bring a disbeliever to belief.

722
00:51:20,119 --> 00:51:24,613
A cynic into faith. That would test
my mettle. But how?

723
00:51:24,665 --> 00:51:26,656
I know just the thing.

724
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:30,709
I'll introduce you to him as a ghost
he already believes in,

725
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:32,790
then he'll see you without any trouble.

726
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:34,922
- Is there such a ghost?
- Yes.

727
00:51:34,967 --> 00:51:37,800
We saw a performance of Hamlet
once in London,

728
00:51:37,845 --> 00:51:40,507
and everybody loved
the ghost of Hamlet's father,

729
00:51:40,556 --> 00:51:43,298
partly because he came in early while
everyone was still awake,

730
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:46,558
but you'd be great in that part.

731
00:51:46,604 --> 00:51:48,811
Thou speaks wiser than thou knowest.

732
00:51:48,856 --> 00:51:54,271
I gave will my thoughts on that role
when he did visit here in 1599.

733
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:55,730
You knew Shakespeare?

734
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:59,738
I did, and save for my familiar Gabriel,

735
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:04,197
his words have been my only
companions for 400 years.

736
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:07,704
Thou knowest how Hamlet's father
must be confined by day

737
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:09,581
and walk abroad at night?

738
00:52:09,627 --> 00:52:13,745
Where does thou think will
Shakespeare gottest that?

739
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:15,753
From you?

740
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:20,217
In me you see the genius.

741
00:52:20,262 --> 00:52:21,843
The original.

742
00:52:21,889 --> 00:52:24,676
You might almost say the part was
writ for me.

743
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:27,307
I knew you'd be terrific.

744
00:52:28,854 --> 00:52:31,971
And you must play prince Hamlet.

745
00:52:32,024 --> 00:52:34,231
We will perform it
in the banqueting hall.

746
00:52:34,276 --> 00:52:36,483
Gabriel will provide the stage effects.

747
00:52:36,528 --> 00:52:39,361
And you must wear...

748
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:41,988
A cloak.

749
00:52:43,118 --> 00:52:44,483
Just my size.

750
00:52:44,536 --> 00:52:48,279
For myself, my armour will well suit

751
00:52:48,332 --> 00:52:51,699
which last I wore before the virgin
queen at Kenilworth.

752
00:52:58,926 --> 00:53:00,791
Until tomorrow night?

753
00:53:14,233 --> 00:53:16,098
Oh, Gabriel.

754
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:19,685
I scarcely dare to think it.

755
00:53:19,738 --> 00:53:22,150
Might it be she at last?

756
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:25,399
No.

757
00:53:25,452 --> 00:53:27,408
It is too much to hope.

758
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:34,283
And yet she is a lass unparalleled.

759
00:53:38,507 --> 00:53:42,170
And then Hamlet says,
"oh my...” what?

760
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:43,880
Prophetic soul.

761
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:45,794
Oh, my prophetic soul.

762
00:53:45,848 --> 00:53:47,804
Ok, good. I think I've got it.

763
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:49,306
I hope this works.

764
00:53:49,351 --> 00:53:51,182
Yeah, you and me both.

765
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:55,471
What's that over there?

766
00:53:55,524 --> 00:53:59,437
It's the old chapel. It's one of the
required sights of the district.

767
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:01,147
Would you like to see it?

768
00:54:01,196 --> 00:54:02,527
Sure.

769
00:54:05,784 --> 00:54:08,321
This is the Canterville family plot.

770
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:11,328
It goes all the way back
through the centuries.

771
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:13,659
Are sir Simon and
lady Eleanore here?

772
00:54:13,709 --> 00:54:16,667
No. I don't know if anyone knows
where they are.

773
00:54:19,548 --> 00:54:23,006
When I was little, I used to climb
right to the top of the bell tower.

774
00:54:23,051 --> 00:54:25,292
The bell's cracked,
so doesn't ring but...

775
00:54:25,345 --> 00:54:26,801
"The silent chapel bell."

776
00:54:26,847 --> 00:54:28,087
- Sorry?
- Oh, nothing.

777
00:54:29,725 --> 00:54:31,590
Oh, look.

778
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:33,099
The moon is rising.

779
00:54:34,229 --> 00:54:36,140
It's a blue moon.

780
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:40,650
- Blue?
- Second full moon in a month.

781
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:43,811
Supposed to make people fall in love.

782
00:54:45,783 --> 00:54:47,489
Let's look inside.

783
00:54:52,372 --> 00:54:53,908
This is wonderful.

784
00:55:01,048 --> 00:55:02,663
It's like time stands still here.

785
00:55:15,187 --> 00:55:17,098
Virginia...

786
00:55:18,232 --> 00:55:20,689
It's as if I've known you all my life.

787
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:22,565
I feel that, too.

788
00:55:23,946 --> 00:55:25,402
But I'm...

789
00:55:26,698 --> 00:55:28,108
I'm scared.

790
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:29,944
Why?

791
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:33,611
Well, let's face it. Sooner or later,
I'll be going home to Indiana.

792
00:55:33,664 --> 00:55:38,328
But nothing can come between us,
not if we're really meant for each other.

793
00:55:38,377 --> 00:55:40,663
You seem so sure.

794
00:55:40,712 --> 00:55:42,043
I am.

795
00:55:45,676 --> 00:55:47,041
I think.

796
00:55:51,098 --> 00:55:54,215
I've never felt this way before.
It's...

797
00:55:54,268 --> 00:55:55,474
Hard to be sure.

798
00:55:56,937 --> 00:55:58,177
Right.

799
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:00,679
And what if we're wrong?

800
00:56:02,526 --> 00:56:04,858
We must at least give it a chance.

801
00:56:04,903 --> 00:56:06,609
Don't you feel that?

802
00:56:09,616 --> 00:56:11,152
I don't know.

803
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:13,237
I just, um...

804
00:56:14,955 --> 00:56:16,820
I don't know.

805
00:56:18,417 --> 00:56:19,657
I see.

806
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:22,705
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

807
00:56:34,558 --> 00:56:38,642
Why do you season this your love
with so much salt water?

808
00:56:39,771 --> 00:56:42,012
Oh, sir Simon. Love?

809
00:56:44,151 --> 00:56:47,894
I've never felt this before.
I don't know what to do.

810
00:56:56,371 --> 00:57:01,081
You fear the thrill that seized your
heart when you did kiss that boy.

811
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:06,628
It is awfully scary.

812
00:57:07,758 --> 00:57:11,546
Love it is, and not to be denied.

813
00:57:11,595 --> 00:57:13,756
And it can bring you joy untold.

814
00:57:16,892 --> 00:57:18,974
But if we are weak...

815
00:57:20,312 --> 00:57:24,555
If we succumb to fear
or green-eyed jealousy,

816
00:57:24,608 --> 00:57:27,566
then it can wreak a terrible
devastation on our soul.

817
00:57:29,321 --> 00:57:30,731
I know whereof I speak.

818
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:40,036
But never to have loved...

819
00:57:45,629 --> 00:57:49,713
Or sadder still, to have loved
and let it slip away...

820
00:57:51,843 --> 00:57:53,959
Is never to have lived at all.

821
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:55,218
Then love...

822
00:57:56,974 --> 00:57:59,056
And come what sorrow may,

823
00:57:59,101 --> 00:58:05,017
it cannot countervail the bliss that one
sweet minute gives you in his sight.

824
00:58:05,065 --> 00:58:07,477
Come, go you to this boy.

825
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:12,027
And let love guide you.

826
00:58:13,991 --> 00:58:15,697
Oh, sir Simon, thank you.

827
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:18,780
Thank you.

828
00:58:35,804 --> 00:58:40,514
Lassie, you have bereft me
of all words.

829
00:59:01,830 --> 00:59:04,321
All right, I think we're set.

830
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:05,489
Do you have everything?

831
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:07,533
Yeah, my costumes and things
are up there.

832
00:59:09,421 --> 00:59:10,456
Are you two ready?

833
00:59:10,505 --> 00:59:11,585
Good.

834
00:59:11,631 --> 00:59:14,122
Come on, everybody. Show time.

835
00:59:14,176 --> 00:59:17,088
Virginia, remember,
it's "prophetic soul".

836
00:59:17,137 --> 00:59:18,798
Prophetic soul.

837
00:59:21,475 --> 00:59:23,841
- Cool!
- Good luck.

838
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:26,351
This way, ladies and gentlemen.

839
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:29,388
Mr and Mrs umney, would you please
take your seats here?

840
00:59:29,441 --> 00:59:30,772
Your grace.

841
00:59:33,403 --> 00:59:36,895
Now, the performance will take place
from the gallery.

842
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:41,199
Now listen, he's a little nervous,

843
00:59:41,244 --> 00:59:44,486
so don't make any rude noises or
pull any practical jokes, ok?

844
00:59:44,539 --> 00:59:45,619
Promise?

845
00:59:45,665 --> 00:59:48,156
- Wouldn't dare.
- Good.

846
00:59:48,210 --> 00:59:52,203
Now, remember, at the beginning
of the play, Hamlet's father has died,

847
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:54,792
and his uncle has married his mother.

848
00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:57,628
Now, in this scene, Hamlet meets
the ghost of his father,

849
00:59:57,677 --> 01:00:00,089
who tells him that he was actually
murdered by the uncle.

850
01:00:00,138 --> 01:00:04,928
I'll be Hamlet, and we have a special
guest star playing the ghost.

851
01:00:04,976 --> 01:00:10,972
Hey, wait till the kids at school hear we
had a real ghost playing a ghost for us.

852
01:00:12,776 --> 01:00:15,813
You know, one rarely gets
the chance to see Shakespeare

853
01:00:15,862 --> 01:00:18,444
performed by somebody
who actually knew him.

854
01:00:44,141 --> 01:00:46,723
Hiram, look.

855
01:00:50,272 --> 01:00:52,888
Wither wilt thou leave me?
Speak. I go no further.

856
01:00:52,941 --> 01:00:55,523
- Mark me.
- I will.

857
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:59,440
My hour is almost come

858
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:04,108
when I to sulphurous and
tormenting flames

859
01:01:04,161 --> 01:01:06,698
must render up myself.

860
01:01:06,746 --> 01:01:08,031
Alas, poor ghost.

861
01:01:08,081 --> 01:01:09,742
Pity me not.

862
01:01:09,791 --> 01:01:14,285
But lend thy serious hearing
to what I shall unfold.

863
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:16,874
Speak, I am bound to hear.

864
01:01:16,923 --> 01:01:20,211
I am thy father's spirit,

865
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:26,176
doomed for a certain term
to walk the night

866
01:01:26,224 --> 01:01:31,560
and for the day confined to fast
in fires,

867
01:01:31,605 --> 01:01:37,271
till the foul crimes done in
my days of nature

868
01:01:37,319 --> 01:01:39,526
are burnt and purged away.

869
01:01:40,906 --> 01:01:44,148
- Wow!
- Double wow!

870
01:01:44,201 --> 01:01:45,737
Sh!

871
01:01:45,785 --> 01:01:52,156
List, list, o, list.

872
01:01:52,209 --> 01:01:56,623
If ever thou didst thy dear father love,

873
01:01:56,671 --> 01:02:02,416
revenge his foul and
most unnatural murder.

874
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:06,590
- Murder?
- Murder most foul

875
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:09,006
as in the best it is.

876
01:02:09,059 --> 01:02:13,974
But this most foul strange and
unnatural.

877
01:02:14,022 --> 01:02:16,013
Haste me to know it.

878
01:02:16,066 --> 01:02:17,431
Know then, thou noble youth.

879
01:02:17,484 --> 01:02:21,523
The serpent that did sting
thy father's life

880
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:23,857
now wears his crown.

881
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:28,988
Oh, my prophetic soul. My uncle?

882
01:02:29,037 --> 01:02:34,157
Aye, that incestuous,
that adulterous beast

883
01:02:34,209 --> 01:02:40,330
won to his lust the will of my most
seeming virtuous queen.

884
01:02:40,382 --> 01:02:42,338
O Hamlet,

885
01:02:42,384 --> 01:02:47,595
what a falling-off was there,
from me whose love...

886
01:02:53,144 --> 01:02:56,136
Whose love was of that dignity...

887
01:02:59,067 --> 01:03:05,028
That it went hand in hand even with
the vow I made to her in marriage...

888
01:03:06,825 --> 01:03:09,237
Sir Simon, what is it?

889
01:03:17,585 --> 01:03:19,792
Forgive me.

890
01:03:25,176 --> 01:03:26,666
Forgive me.

891
01:03:50,327 --> 01:03:52,864
Wonderful, your grace.

892
01:03:54,581 --> 01:03:55,661
That was rad!

893
01:03:55,707 --> 01:03:57,197
Yeah, that was cool!

894
01:03:57,250 --> 01:04:00,538
Would you please congratulate
miss Virginia on her...

895
01:04:00,587 --> 01:04:02,498
Outstanding performance?

896
01:04:02,547 --> 01:04:04,959
Gave me the chills, I can tell you.

897
01:04:05,008 --> 01:04:06,669
Yes, I will. Thank you.

898
01:04:06,718 --> 01:04:08,174
If you'll excuse us.

899
01:04:08,219 --> 01:04:10,801
- Your grace.
- Here she comes.

900
01:04:11,973 --> 01:04:14,510
- That was awesome, Ginny.
- Yeah, that was cool!

901
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:15,594
It was wonderful.

902
01:04:15,643 --> 01:04:17,304
Ginny, really, I don't know
what to say.

903
01:04:17,354 --> 01:04:19,060
- That's ok, dad.
- No, really.

904
01:04:19,105 --> 01:04:22,472
I don't know how you and your friend
did it, but it was quite an illusion.

905
01:04:22,525 --> 01:04:23,685
Hiram! You just saw...

906
01:04:23,735 --> 01:04:27,148
I'll figure it out eventually,
but it was a first-rate effect.

907
01:04:27,197 --> 01:04:29,062
- Effect?
- Of course.

908
01:04:29,115 --> 01:04:33,074
I'm just amazed that you went to such
trouble for a practical joke.

909
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:35,861
Well, it's late. We'd better turn in.

910
01:04:35,914 --> 01:04:39,031
Um, good night, Francis.
We'll see you tomorrow.

911
01:04:44,255 --> 01:04:47,998
I'm sorry. Your father just seems to
refuse to believe.

912
01:04:48,051 --> 01:04:49,336
Yeah.

913
01:04:49,386 --> 01:04:51,422
I'm more worried about sir Simon.

914
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:54,629
May I see you tomorrow?

915
01:04:54,682 --> 01:04:55,888
Yes.

916
01:04:58,311 --> 01:04:59,767
Good night.

917
01:05:07,737 --> 01:05:09,693
I'm sorry, I...

918
01:05:10,990 --> 01:05:12,400
Forgive me.

919
01:05:14,494 --> 01:05:16,610
I don't know why you give
her such a hard time.

920
01:05:16,663 --> 01:05:20,121
Look, Lucy, I know there's
an explanation for all of this.

921
01:05:20,166 --> 01:05:22,202
I just haven't figured it out yet.

922
01:05:23,336 --> 01:05:27,579
Hi, the explanation is simple.
The house is haunted.

923
01:05:27,632 --> 01:05:29,293
- You really believe that?
- Yes, I do.

924
01:05:29,342 --> 01:05:31,628
Sir Simon is a ghost,

925
01:05:31,678 --> 01:05:35,967
and as far as Ginny is concerned,
you've acted like a complete idiot.

926
01:05:40,311 --> 01:05:43,428
For the past couple of years
you two have been at each other.

927
01:05:43,481 --> 01:05:46,188
You used to be so close.

928
01:05:46,234 --> 01:05:50,102
I admit I'm having a problem
dealing with her, ok?

929
01:05:51,239 --> 01:05:54,072
I don't know. I don't know.

930
01:05:54,117 --> 01:05:57,860
She used to sit with me, she used to
talk to me.

931
01:05:57,912 --> 01:06:00,369
And now, she's growing up.

932
01:06:00,415 --> 01:06:04,749
Most of the time, I have no idea what
she's feeling, what she's thinking.

933
01:06:07,213 --> 01:06:08,828
Honey!

934
01:06:08,882 --> 01:06:11,294
Most of the time,
she doesn't know herself.

935
01:06:11,342 --> 01:06:14,755
She's a teenager. It's tough.

936
01:06:16,723 --> 01:06:18,509
I suppose.

937
01:06:18,558 --> 01:06:21,891
But there's one thing that hasn't
changed, Luce.

938
01:06:21,936 --> 01:06:23,722
There are still no ghosts.

939
01:06:26,566 --> 01:06:28,898
You take the cake!

940
01:06:28,943 --> 01:06:30,103
Where are you going?

941
01:06:30,153 --> 01:06:33,111
I'm going to check on our daughter,
see if she's all right.

942
01:06:39,537 --> 01:06:41,118
Ginny.

943
01:06:42,790 --> 01:06:44,701
Let her sleep.

944
01:06:44,751 --> 01:06:47,493
Promise I'll speak to her
in the morning. Come on.

945
01:07:01,684 --> 01:07:03,470
Sir Simon?

946
01:07:20,078 --> 01:07:21,784
Sir Simon, what's wrong?

947
01:07:21,829 --> 01:07:24,366
Why did you stop like that?

948
01:07:24,415 --> 01:07:26,952
I've read that speech so often.

949
01:07:27,001 --> 01:07:29,788
But just now, the meaning struck me
as never before.

950
01:07:31,339 --> 01:07:35,878
Oh, Virginia, if I were to tell you
the secrets of my prison house,

951
01:07:35,927 --> 01:07:37,792
you would hate me as I hate myself.

952
01:07:38,930 --> 01:07:41,012
Nothing could make me hate you.

953
01:07:56,406 --> 01:07:58,146
You can tell me anything.

954
01:08:03,037 --> 01:08:05,574
Wouldst wish to know how
I became a ghost?

955
01:08:07,542 --> 01:08:10,500
Well, the book said that you were
suspected of killing your wife,

956
01:08:10,545 --> 01:08:12,206
- but I didn't believe it.
- It's true.

957
01:08:13,256 --> 01:08:15,338
It is?

958
01:08:15,383 --> 01:08:17,999
For years, our lives were
sweet and full.

959
01:08:19,596 --> 01:08:23,589
And then, the green-eyed monster in
my mind did sow his seed

960
01:08:23,641 --> 01:08:27,384
which like a canker shrivelled up
my love.

961
01:08:28,521 --> 01:08:32,434
There was a man who
I believed a friend.

962
01:08:32,483 --> 01:08:37,944
A friend I took for truth
what he told me,

963
01:08:37,989 --> 01:08:42,358
that like Hamlet's mother,
my wife had been unfaithful to me.

964
01:08:42,410 --> 01:08:46,403
I fell into a jealous rage,
I locked her in the house,

965
01:08:46,456 --> 01:08:50,995
I forbade to her all company,
I berated her constantly.

966
01:08:51,044 --> 01:08:55,037
Her very denials inflamed
my madness.

967
01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:01,671
I drove her to such despair...

968
01:09:02,972 --> 01:09:07,716
That at length, I dragged her into
madness, too.

969
01:09:07,769 --> 01:09:10,761
And one terrible night,

970
01:09:10,813 --> 01:09:16,774
there, by that fireplace, she took
my dagger and she killed herself.

971
01:09:18,821 --> 01:09:20,903
And she died in my arms.

972
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:25,400
My tears mingled with her blood.

973
01:09:27,413 --> 01:09:30,621
You see, that stain is ours.

974
01:09:30,667 --> 01:09:33,374
Oh, sir Simon.

975
01:09:33,419 --> 01:09:39,255
I buried her secretly, in a place that
she loved best in the world,

976
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:45,512
and I... put... an angel there
to guard her.

977
01:09:45,556 --> 01:09:47,137
The garden.

978
01:09:48,601 --> 01:09:50,137
I've been there.
Francis took me.

979
01:09:52,146 --> 01:09:55,638
And soon, I learned
that she was innocent.

980
01:09:55,692 --> 01:09:59,150
My friend had lied.
He had wanted her for himself.

981
01:10:00,279 --> 01:10:03,771
She loved me. She was loyal.

982
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:07,821
And every...

983
01:10:09,622 --> 01:10:13,786
Every day, every moment since then,
I miss her.

984
01:10:17,964 --> 01:10:21,957
And that is why I could not bear
to see you lose your love.

985
01:10:25,012 --> 01:10:26,843
And how did you die then?

986
01:10:28,808 --> 01:10:31,550
I summoned her family
here to the house,

987
01:10:31,602 --> 01:10:34,844
and I confessed to them my crimes,

988
01:10:34,897 --> 01:10:37,934
and I bid them do with me
whatever they wished.

989
01:10:37,984 --> 01:10:40,566
And her brothers brought me
here to this cell.

990
01:10:40,611 --> 01:10:47,073
They chained me to the wall,
and here I starved a lingering death.

991
01:10:47,118 --> 01:10:48,654
How horrible.

992
01:10:49,912 --> 01:10:53,780
I would die a thousand deaths
if I could undo what I've done.

993
01:10:53,833 --> 01:10:55,789
But there was more.

994
01:10:55,835 --> 01:11:00,920
They brought a witch who conjured
a spell...

995
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:05,463
That, like Hamlet's father,

996
01:11:05,511 --> 01:11:09,800
I was doomed to walk the night
and for the day confined,

997
01:11:09,849 --> 01:11:12,932
here to brood on my sins.

998
01:11:12,977 --> 01:11:14,467
But...

999
01:11:16,814 --> 01:11:19,021
Most of all, remembering her.

1000
01:11:21,569 --> 01:11:23,184
Then when do you sleep?

1001
01:11:23,237 --> 01:11:26,070
I am forbid to close my eyes.

1002
01:11:27,617 --> 01:11:32,236
By day, I'm here, by night,
I haunt. It is ordained.

1003
01:11:34,165 --> 01:11:38,408
I have not slept for over 400 years,
and in truth...

1004
01:11:40,546 --> 01:11:43,083
I'm so very, very tired.

1005
01:12:01,275 --> 01:12:04,267
Poor, poor sir Simon.

1006
01:12:05,863 --> 01:12:08,980
Isn't there any place
that you can sleep?

1007
01:12:09,033 --> 01:12:12,150
Oh, yes. That peaceful garden.

1008
01:12:12,203 --> 01:12:14,239
The angel of death could take
me there.

1009
01:12:14,288 --> 01:12:19,328
To lie in the soft, brown earth,
listening to the silence.

1010
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:23,001
Forgiving life.

1011
01:12:24,799 --> 01:12:26,960
At peace beside my Eleanore.

1012
01:12:28,553 --> 01:12:30,544
And can that happen?

1013
01:12:30,596 --> 01:12:33,053
Yes. Thou canst make it so.

1014
01:12:33,099 --> 01:12:34,509
How?

1015
01:12:35,935 --> 01:12:38,267
- There is a prophecy.
- I've read it.

1016
01:12:39,397 --> 01:12:41,058
But I don't know what it means.

1017
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:45,312
I'll show you. Come. Here.

1018
01:12:53,077 --> 01:12:55,443
Here now. Read aloud.

1019
01:12:57,206 --> 01:13:01,415
"When a gentlegirl can win prayer
from out the lips of sin,

1020
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:05,123
"when a child gives up... her tears..."

1021
01:13:07,049 --> 01:13:08,255
Am I a gentlegirl?

1022
01:13:08,301 --> 01:13:13,796
Oh, yes, thou art.
And still so young to be called a child.

1023
01:13:15,266 --> 01:13:16,881
What do I have to do?

1024
01:13:16,934 --> 01:13:19,801
You have wept for my sins,

1025
01:13:19,854 --> 01:13:23,017
for I have no tears left.

1026
01:13:23,065 --> 01:13:26,853
Next, you must pray for me,

1027
01:13:26,903 --> 01:13:29,861
because I had no faith in love.

1028
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:33,902
And then...

1029
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:39,537
If you would go with me into
the realm of darkness,

1030
01:13:39,582 --> 01:13:43,746
there to stand before
the angel of death...

1031
01:13:43,794 --> 01:13:46,035
And speak for me...

1032
01:13:47,465 --> 01:13:49,581
The angel will have mercy on me.

1033
01:13:51,594 --> 01:13:53,425
"Then shall all the house be still...

1034
01:13:54,597 --> 01:13:57,555
"And peace shall come to Canterville."

1035
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:59,340
To you.

1036
01:13:59,393 --> 01:14:01,224
Oh yes.

1037
01:14:04,023 --> 01:14:05,854
What is it like in the realm of
darkness?

1038
01:14:09,028 --> 01:14:10,939
I tremble even to think of it.

1039
01:14:12,698 --> 01:14:17,988
There is mist, and fearful shapes do
lurk in it,

1040
01:14:18,037 --> 01:14:21,450
imprisoned in the voiceless winds,

1041
01:14:21,499 --> 01:14:23,911
blown with restless violence.

1042
01:14:25,711 --> 01:14:27,793
And evil voices whisper in your ear.

1043
01:14:29,590 --> 01:14:33,629
But if you hold steadfast to your belief
and show no fear,

1044
01:14:33,678 --> 01:14:35,634
they cannot hurt you.

1045
01:14:36,764 --> 01:14:41,178
Against the purity of faith,
the powers of darkness cannot prevail.

1046
01:14:42,645 --> 01:14:44,135
I'm not afraid.

1047
01:14:45,898 --> 01:14:49,231
I'll go with you and tell the angel...

1048
01:14:49,276 --> 01:14:53,019
That you are a good and kind ghost...

1049
01:14:53,072 --> 01:14:56,405
Who gave me the courage
to follow my heart.

1050
01:15:01,372 --> 01:15:03,203
Now you, my lady,

1051
01:15:03,249 --> 01:15:05,535
and as a true knight should,

1052
01:15:05,584 --> 01:15:10,123
I pledge my soul to your safety
and happiness for ever.

1053
01:15:15,469 --> 01:15:18,677
On that spot did I forfeit my soul.

1054
01:15:28,399 --> 01:15:31,232
This is Virginia Otis

1055
01:15:31,277 --> 01:15:34,861
praying for this poor old ghost,

1056
01:15:34,905 --> 01:15:37,567
sir Simon de Canterville,

1057
01:15:37,616 --> 01:15:40,232
who is very sorry
for what he has done.

1058
01:15:42,663 --> 01:15:48,033
He can't undo it, but he has spent
dozens of lifetimes paying for it.

1059
01:15:51,505 --> 01:15:53,996
You need to forgive him,

1060
01:15:54,050 --> 01:15:56,291
because he can't forgive himself.

1061
01:15:58,220 --> 01:15:59,801
Please?

1062
01:16:11,025 --> 01:16:13,983
You have been heard.

1063
01:16:16,530 --> 01:16:18,020
I'm ready now.

1064
01:16:27,666 --> 01:16:32,285
Remember, show no fear,
hold fast to your faith.

1065
01:16:32,338 --> 01:16:35,671
I could not bear the weight
of two loves lost.

1066
01:16:35,716 --> 01:16:37,206
I'll be fine.

1067
01:16:50,439 --> 01:16:53,146
You can only pass through
while the clock chimes.

1068
01:17:38,863 --> 01:17:41,070
Ginny.

1069
01:17:41,115 --> 01:17:45,358
Pumpkin. It's me, the old man.

1070
01:17:46,495 --> 01:17:50,864
Look, I know I've been unreasonable
about this whole business.

1071
01:17:50,916 --> 01:17:55,831
And I'm sorry. I'm gonna try harder to
maybe see things more your way.

1072
01:17:57,298 --> 01:18:01,587
So please forgive me for being
so insensitive.

1073
01:18:04,138 --> 01:18:05,628
Gin-gin?

1074
01:18:12,438 --> 01:18:14,394
Lucille!

1075
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:17,273
Has anyone seen Ginny?
She's not in her room.

1076
01:18:17,318 --> 01:18:20,185
- She must've gotten up early.
- No, her bed hasn't been slept in.

1077
01:18:21,864 --> 01:18:24,276
All right, let's spread out and search.

1078
01:18:24,325 --> 01:18:26,285
Mr umney, you know the grounds
better than anyone.

1079
01:18:26,327 --> 01:18:28,033
The grounds? Yes.

1080
01:18:28,078 --> 01:18:29,318
I'll go with Mr umney.

1081
01:18:29,371 --> 01:18:31,224
- I'll search here with Mrs umney.
- I'll go upstairs.

1082
01:18:31,248 --> 01:18:35,582
- I'll go with you.
- Let's meet back in the library.

1083
01:18:35,628 --> 01:18:38,244
Come on, Mr umney!

1084
01:18:38,297 --> 01:18:41,084
- Your grace, emergency.
- Ginny's missing.

1085
01:18:41,133 --> 01:18:43,169
Will you search the grounds,
your grace?

1086
01:18:46,722 --> 01:18:48,337
- No sign?
- No.

1087
01:18:55,814 --> 01:18:58,647
I have an idea.
Come on. Let's try the chapel.

1088
01:19:02,613 --> 01:19:05,901
Quiet, please. We need help.

1089
01:19:23,425 --> 01:19:25,006
That way.

1090
01:19:29,932 --> 01:19:31,638
Have you seen an American girl?

1091
01:19:31,684 --> 01:19:32,924
No.

1092
01:19:42,611 --> 01:19:44,101
Dad?

1093
01:19:46,949 --> 01:19:48,814
Dad?

1094
01:19:49,952 --> 01:19:51,692
Dad...

1095
01:19:55,666 --> 01:19:57,748
Hiram!

1096
01:20:00,129 --> 01:20:01,994
Hiram!

1097
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:04,129
It's the cloak she was wearing.

1098
01:20:04,174 --> 01:20:06,631
And the stain's truly gone.

1099
01:20:06,677 --> 01:20:08,417
Oh, god, she's with him.

1100
01:20:08,470 --> 01:20:10,301
She's with him!

1101
01:20:11,432 --> 01:20:15,220
Oh, no. Lucy, I've been so blind.

1102
01:20:16,603 --> 01:20:18,764
If anything's happened to her...

1103
01:20:18,814 --> 01:20:22,557
If anything's happened to her,
I'll never forgive myself.

1104
01:20:39,001 --> 01:20:41,538
You've not touched your food.

1105
01:20:41,587 --> 01:20:43,669
We're not hungry, Mrs umney.

1106
01:20:43,714 --> 01:20:46,672
Yes, it's the same with us.

1107
01:20:46,717 --> 01:20:51,131
Please, we're all exhausted.
Just leave it till tomorrow.

1108
01:20:51,180 --> 01:20:54,843
Bless you all, and good night.

1109
01:20:55,934 --> 01:20:58,175
She'll be in our prayers.

1110
01:21:02,816 --> 01:21:05,728
Well, there's nothing more
we can do tonight.

1111
01:21:05,778 --> 01:21:09,020
Let's turn in and get started
again in the morning.

1112
01:21:18,665 --> 01:21:19,871
What's that?

1113
01:21:19,917 --> 01:21:21,908
It's coming from the library.

1114
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:23,291
Let's go.

1115
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:40,175
- What's happening?
- Mum, dad.

1116
01:21:40,229 --> 01:21:41,435
Boys, come here.

1117
01:21:50,364 --> 01:21:52,355
Dad, where are you?

1118
01:21:52,408 --> 01:21:54,069
Ginny?

1119
01:21:54,118 --> 01:21:57,451
- Ginny?
- I can't find my way back.

1120
01:21:58,956 --> 01:22:00,571
I've got you.

1121
01:22:00,624 --> 01:22:04,082
- Francis!
- Virginia! Where are you?

1122
01:22:04,128 --> 01:22:06,084
- Ginny!
- This way!

1123
01:22:06,130 --> 01:22:07,916
Daddy, I can't see you.

1124
01:22:07,965 --> 01:22:10,001
Ginny, follow the voice!

1125
01:22:10,050 --> 01:22:12,541
Virginia, follow my voice.

1126
01:22:12,594 --> 01:22:14,175
Virginia, where are you?

1127
01:22:14,221 --> 01:22:16,507
- I can't see you.
- It's this way.

1128
01:22:16,557 --> 01:22:17,967
Follow my voice.

1129
01:22:18,016 --> 01:22:19,927
I'm slipping.

1130
01:22:21,603 --> 01:22:23,559
Dad!

1131
01:22:25,649 --> 01:22:28,061
Dad, where are you?

1132
01:22:28,110 --> 01:22:30,442
Virginia, over here.

1133
01:22:30,487 --> 01:22:32,478
It's closing!

1134
01:22:32,531 --> 01:22:35,318
- No!
- Virginia!

1135
01:22:35,367 --> 01:22:38,074
I'm here, Virginia,
take my hand.

1136
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:41,704
Mum, dad, it's closing.

1137
01:22:43,750 --> 01:22:45,456
Dad!

1138
01:22:46,628 --> 01:22:48,209
Got you!

1139
01:22:58,307 --> 01:23:03,643
- Ginny, I thought I'd lost you.
- Thank heaven it's all over.

1140
01:23:03,687 --> 01:23:05,097
Oh, mum.

1141
01:23:05,147 --> 01:23:06,353
Dad.

1142
01:23:15,949 --> 01:23:18,361
Wow! A secret door!

1143
01:23:18,410 --> 01:23:22,153
Come on.
We have to see about sir Simon.

1144
01:23:39,056 --> 01:23:40,842
I thought it was open.

1145
01:23:41,975 --> 01:23:43,556
Daddy, we have to get in.

1146
01:23:43,602 --> 01:23:45,843
Lucy, hold this.

1147
01:23:59,618 --> 01:24:02,234
We have to look after his earthly body.

1148
01:24:08,252 --> 01:24:10,117
Poor sir Simon.

1149
01:24:20,514 --> 01:24:22,971
We'll take care of him now, Gabriel.

1150
01:24:31,692 --> 01:24:33,523
Listen.

1151
01:24:36,238 --> 01:24:38,103
It's the chapel bell!

1152
01:24:51,753 --> 01:24:53,459
Look!

1153
01:25:00,220 --> 01:25:05,010
"When the silent chapel bell sounds
the ghostly sinners knell,

1154
01:25:05,058 --> 01:25:06,923
"and the barren almond bears..."

1155
01:25:12,733 --> 01:25:14,598
He's been forgiven.

1156
01:26:16,797 --> 01:26:23,464
To lie in the soft, brown
earth, listening to silence.

1157
01:26:26,807 --> 01:26:29,594
To forgive life,

1158
01:26:29,643 --> 01:26:33,761
to be at peace beside my Eleanore.

1159
01:26:40,237 --> 01:26:43,229
Well, lord Canterville, now that
sir Simon has been laid to rest,

1160
01:26:43,281 --> 01:26:45,693
I suppose your family will
want to return to the hall?

1161
01:26:45,742 --> 01:26:49,280
When you and your family have
returned to America, perhaps.

1162
01:26:49,329 --> 01:26:54,869
Though actually, we have become
quite fond of living in London.

1163
01:26:54,918 --> 01:26:56,909
Why? Have you something in mind?

1164
01:26:56,962 --> 01:27:00,955
Well, I've spoken to the university
about extending my research Grant.

1165
01:27:01,007 --> 01:27:02,588
Oh, dad, really?

1166
01:27:02,634 --> 01:27:05,421
And there are some
wonderful schools.

1167
01:27:05,470 --> 01:27:06,801
- Cool!
- Yes!

1168
01:27:06,847 --> 01:27:09,304
And Lucille tells me
that she loves England,

1169
01:27:09,349 --> 01:27:12,557
so would you consider extending
the lease indefinitely?

1170
01:27:12,602 --> 01:27:15,765
Oh, and of course, we'd be delighted

1171
01:27:15,814 --> 01:27:18,305
if the Umneys would consider
staying on.

1172
01:27:18,358 --> 01:27:21,350
Yes, and we'd promise to be good,
wouldn't we, Adam?

1173
01:27:21,403 --> 01:27:22,438
You bet!

1174
01:27:22,487 --> 01:27:25,945
I'm sure there's nothing that
Mrs umney would enjoy more.

1175
01:27:25,991 --> 01:27:27,606
Of course we would love to.

1176
01:27:27,659 --> 01:27:29,365
So what do you say?

1177
01:27:31,371 --> 01:27:32,702
Please?

1178
01:27:32,748 --> 01:27:35,535
I can think of nothing more fitting

1179
01:27:35,584 --> 01:27:39,293
than you and your family remaining
here for as long as you'd like.

1180
01:27:39,337 --> 01:27:41,623
- Oh!
- Cheers!

1181
01:27:41,673 --> 01:27:44,005
Wonderful!

1182
01:27:44,050 --> 01:27:45,290
Oh, one more thing.

1183
01:27:46,845 --> 01:27:48,836
My dear girl.

1184
01:27:48,889 --> 01:27:54,850
You've rendered my unlucky ancestor
a very important service.

1185
01:27:54,895 --> 01:28:00,265
My family and I are much indebted
to you for your marvellous courage.

1186
01:28:00,317 --> 01:28:03,309
Now this box contains a ring.

1187
01:28:04,613 --> 01:28:08,526
It belonged to the lady Eleanore.

1188
01:28:08,575 --> 01:28:12,739
On behalf of the entire
Canterville family,

1189
01:28:12,788 --> 01:28:16,997
I give you our deepest thanks.

1190
01:28:18,251 --> 01:28:21,869
You're a very extraordinary
young lady.

1191
01:28:46,738 --> 01:28:47,978
Wow!

1192
01:28:48,031 --> 01:28:50,898
Francis, the garden's come back
to life.

1193
01:28:53,537 --> 01:28:54,947
It's beautiful.

1194
01:29:09,803 --> 01:29:13,136
May this bring the two of you
back together,

1195
01:29:13,181 --> 01:29:16,514
as sir Simon brought Francis
and me together.

1196
01:29:19,229 --> 01:29:21,311
And lady Eleanore...

1197
01:29:22,566 --> 01:29:25,103
Sir Simon made me see what life is,

1198
01:29:25,151 --> 01:29:27,984
and what death is,

1199
01:29:28,029 --> 01:29:30,395
and that love is stronger than both.

1200
01:29:46,673 --> 01:29:48,004
Please forgive him.

1201
01:29:50,802 --> 01:29:56,513
Adieu. Adieu. Adieu.

1202
01:29:56,558 --> 01:30:00,471
Remember me, my gentleqirl.

1203
01:30:11,364 --> 01:30:13,821
Oh, Simon, read me another sonnet.

1204
01:30:13,867 --> 01:30:17,359
Ah, yes, my dear.
With the greatest pleasure.

1205
01:30:18,496 --> 01:30:22,489
"O! Never say that I was
false of heart,

1206
01:30:22,542 --> 01:30:27,332
"though absence seemed my flame
to qualify.

1207
01:30:27,380 --> 01:30:30,588
"As easy might I from myself depart,

1208
01:30:30,634 --> 01:30:35,799
"as from my soul, which in thy breast
doth lie.

1209
01:30:35,847 --> 01:30:39,135
"That is my home of love."
