1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
-On September 3, 1973
at 6.28pm and 32 sec.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
..whose wings can flutter
14 670 times per minute..

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
..a blue fly
of the Calliphorides species,..

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
..landed in Saint-Vincent Street,
Montmartre.

5
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,000
At the exact same second,
outside a restaurant,..

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
..the wind was sweeping in
under a tablecloth,..

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
..causing the glasses to dance
without anybody noticing it.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
At the same time, on the fifth floor
of 28, avenue Trudaine,..

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
..Eugène Koler, erased the name
of his best friend, Émile Maginot,..

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
..in his adress-book
after coming home from his funeral.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Still at the same second,
a spermatozoon..

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
..containing an X-chromosome
and belonging to M. Raphaël Poulain..

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
..was reaching the ovum
of Mrs Poulain,..

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
..born Amandine Fouet.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,800
9 months later a girl was born:..

16
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,800
..Amélie Poulain.

17
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
-Amélie's father was a former
army doctor,..

18
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
..and was working at the hydropathic
establishment of Enghien-les-Bains.

19
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Raphaël Poulain doesn't like..

20
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
..peeing next to somebody else.

21
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
He doesn't like..

22
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
..noticing people laughing
at his sandals...

23
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
...coming out of the water with
his swimming suit sticking to his body

24
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Raphaël Poulain likes..

25
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
..to tear big pieces of wallpaper
off the walls..

26
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
..to line up his shoes
and polish them with great care..

27
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
..to empty his toolbox,..

28
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
..clean it thoroughly,..

29
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
..and, finally, put everything away carefully.

30
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Amélie's mother, Amandine Fouet,..

31
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
..was a Primary School teacher
from Gueugnon,..

32
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
..she had always been
unstable and nervy.

33
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
She doesn't like to have her fingers
all wrinkled by hot water.

34
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
She doesn't like it when
 somebody she doesn't like..

35
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
..touches her,..

36
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
..to have the marks of the sheets
on her cheek in the morning.

37
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
She likes the outfits of
the ice-skaters on TV.

38
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
..to shine the flooring.

39
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
to empty her handbag..

40
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
..clean it thoroughly,..

41
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
..and, finally, putting everything away carefully.

42
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Amélie is 6 years old.

43
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
She would like her father to hold her
in his arms from time to time.

44
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
But the only contact they have
is during the monthly medical check-up.

45
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Moved by this intimacy,
the little girl..

46
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
..can't stop her heart
from beating wildly.

47
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
As a result,..

48
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
..her father believes she suffers
from a heart disease.

49
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Because of this fictitious illness,
she doesn't go to school.

50
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Her mother acts
as her private tutor.

51
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
-"The... chicken... often...

52
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
..hatch... in... the... convent."

53
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
-"The chicken..."

54
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
-Very good.

55
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
-hatch often.
-No !

56
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
-With no contact with
other children,..

57
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
..and mollycoddled by her parents,..

58
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
..Amélie's only refuge
is the world she makes up.

59
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
In that world, vinyls are made
the same way as pancakes,..

60
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
..and the neighbour's wife, who has been
in a coma for months,..

61
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
..just decided to do all
her sleeping at once.

62
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
-This way, I'll stay awake
night and day for the rest of my life.

63
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
-Amélie's only friend
is called "the Cachalot".

64
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
But the atmosphere at home turned it
into a neurasthenic and suicidal fish.

65
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
-Since these suicide-attempts
only increased her mother's stress,..

66
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
..a decision is taken...

67
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
-ENOUGH !!!

68
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
-In order to comfort Amélie,..

69
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
..her mother gives her
a second-hand Kodak.

70
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
-What have you done?

71
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
-A neighbour makes her believe that
her camera causes accidents to happen.

72
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Since she's been taking pictures
 all afternoon,..

73
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
..Amélie finds herself in deep worry
in the evening.

74
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
She collapses in front of the televison,
feeling guilty ..

75
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
..for a fire,..

76
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
..2 derailments
and the crash of a Boeing 747.

77
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Later on, Amélie realizes
that the neighbour had made fun of her,..

78
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
..and decides to take her revenge.

79
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
-But, what the...

80
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
You be careful!

81
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
-and then, one day,
 tragedy struck her.

82
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Like every year, her mother
had taken her to church to lit a candle..

83
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
..so that Heaven would
send her a little brother.

84
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
The divine answer
came 3 minutes later

85
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Alas, it wasn't a newborn
that fell out of the sky..

86
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
..but a tourist from Quebec,
determined to end her life.

87
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Amandine Poulain, born Fouet,
is killed outright.

88
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
After her mother's death,..

89
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
..Amélie finds herself alone
with her father.

90
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
The latter withdraws into himself
even more.

91
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
He starts to build
a miniature mausoleum,..

92
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
..for the ashes of his beloved wife.

93
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Days, months,
then years go by...

94
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
The outside world seems so dull..

95
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
..That Amélie prefers to dream her life
until she's old enough to leave.

96
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
5 years later, Amélie is a waitress
in a bar in Montmartre,..

97
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
.."les Deux Moulins".

98
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Today's 29 August,..

99
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
..in 48 hours, the destiny of
Amélie Poulain will take a different turn.

100
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
but right now, she has no idea
of what's going to happen.

101
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
For her, life goes on
with her collegues and the regulars.

102
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
This is Suzanne, the landlady.

103
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
She limps a little, but has
never spilled the slightest drop.

104
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
When she was young, she used to be
a horse-dancer. She likes..

105
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
..sportsmen who cry
from disappointment.

106
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
She doesn't like it when a man
is humiliated in front of his kid.

107
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
The tobacconist is Georgette,
the hypochondriac.

108
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
When it's not a migraine,
it's the sciatic nerve that's trapped.

109
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,200
She doesn't like to hear..

110
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,000
.."le fruit de vos entrailles
est béni."

111
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
This is Gina, Amélie's colleague,
 granddaughter of a healer.

112
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
She likes to crack her fingers.

113
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Here you can see her bringing a Kir
to Hipolito, the not-successful writer.

114
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
What he likes
is to see a bullfighter getting gored.

115
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
This is Joseph.
Gina's jealous ex-lover.

116
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
He spies on her
to see if she's replaced him.

117
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
The only thing he likes..

118
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
..is to pop the bubbles
of plastic wrappings.

119
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
And finally, there's Philomène,
the air hostess.

120
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Amélie looks after her cat
when she's away. She likes..

121
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
..the sound of the bowl with water on the floor.
As for the cat,..

122
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
..he likes to listen to
children's stories.

123
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
-No thanks, ma'am, 
I never work on Sundays.

124
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
-Amélie often goes to see her father,
during the WE, by train.

125
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
-Why don't you enjoy your retirement, and...
-Do what?

126
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
-Travel,
you never left Enghien.

127
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
-When we were young,
your mother and me,..

128
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
..we'd have liked to travel,
but we never could.

129
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Because of your heart.
-Yes, I know.

130
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
-And now,...
Now...

131
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
-Sometimes, Amélie goes to the movies.

132
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
-I like to turn around in the dark
to see the faces of the people around.

133
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
And I also like to spot the little
detail nobody will ever see.

134
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
But I don't like it
when the driver doesn't watch the road.

135
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
-Amélie doesn't have a boyfriend.

136
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
She tried, but it didn't
live up to her expectations.

137
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
On the other hand, she enjoys
all sorts of little pleasures,..

138
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
..putting her hand
in a bag of seeds,..

139
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
..piercing the crust
of crème brûlée..

140
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
..with the tip of a spoon.

141
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
And play at ducks and drakes
on the Saint-Martin-canal.

142
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
-This is the cristal-man.

143
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Because of an illness, his bones
break like cristal.

144
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
All his furniture is fleece-lined.

145
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
A hand shake is enough
to break his finger-bones,..

146
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
..so he never goes out.

147
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Time hasn't changed anything. Amélie still
shelters in solitude..

148
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
..and asks herself silly questions
about the world or about this town.

149
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
For example, how many couples are
having an orgasm right now?

150
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
-Fifteen...

151
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
-And finally, the night of
30 August 1997.

152
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
This is what will change
the life of Amélie Poulain totally.

153
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
*-Good evening.

154
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
The Princess of Wales, Lady Di
died this afternoon in a car crash.

155
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
She was with her friend...

156
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Only the first man to enter
the grave of Toutankhamon..

157
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
..may understand how
Amélie felt..

158
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
..when she discovered the treasure
that had been hid by a little boy.

159
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
On the 31st of August,
 at 4 in the morning..

160
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
..Amélie suddenly has
a luminous idea.

161
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
She is going to find the owner
of this box..

162
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
..and return his treasure to him.

163
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
If he's moved, that's it, she'll
start to mingle with other people's lives.

164
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
If not, well, too bad.

165
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
-Oh, the young missie of the 5th floor.
We don't often see you.

166
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
-Excuse me. Did a little boy use to live
in my flat in the 50ies ?

167
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
-Come in
and have a drink.

168
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
-No, thanks.
-Yes, come in. Close the door.

169
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Oh, kids...
I've known so many!

170
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
At first, they're cute, and then
they start throwing snowballs..

171
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I know.
-How long have you been here?

172
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
-Since 64.

173
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
People must have told you.

174
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
-No.

175
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Sit down.

176
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
My husband used to work
 at Coccinelle Insurance.

177
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
People liked to say
he slept with his secretary.

178
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
They certainly did stop at
all the hotels in Batignolles...

179
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
And not the little ones.

180
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
'cause the bitch
would certainly spread her legs,..

181
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
..but only in satin cheets!

182
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
My husband started to steal
from his firm.

183
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
First only a little,
then 50 million at once.

184
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
And there they went! Flew away, both of 'em.

185
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Drink !

186
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
So, on January 20 1970,..

187
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
..the doorbell rings. Well...

188
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
"Ma'am, your husband died
in a car crash in South America."

189
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
My life just stopped.

190
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Black Lion died of sorrow.

191
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Poor thing!

192
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
See how he still looks at his master..

193
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
..with love in his eyes.

194
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I'll read his letters to you.

195
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Don't move.

196
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
You can spare me 5 min, can't you?
There, he was in the army.

197
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
"Mado my love..."
My name is Madeleine.

198
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
"I can't sleep. I can't eat.

199
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
"I left my only reason
to live in Paris.

200
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
"I will see her again on friday 15,..

201
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
"..when I'll see my beloved weasel
at the station,..

202
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
"..in her blue dress with straps.

203
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
"(the one you find
too transparent.)

204
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
"Love."
There you are.

205
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Have you ever received
letters like these?

206
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
-No. I'm nobody's
little weasel.

207
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
-My name is Madeleine Walace.

208
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
There's this saying: "Pleurer comme
une madeleine", isn't it?

209
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
-Yes.
-And Walace...

210
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
The Walace Fountains...

211
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
You see, tears
were my destiny!

212
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
For that business of yours...

213
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Go and ask the grocer.

214
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Collignon has always lived
in this building.

215
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,000
-Ah, good morning, Amélie-mélo !

216
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
A fig and 3 nuts,
as usual?

217
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
-The people who lived
in my flat, in the 50ies...

218
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Do you remember them?
-Tough question!

219
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I was 2 in the 50ies.
Just like this moron today.

220
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
-The moron is Lucien.
He's not a genius,..

221
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
..but Amélie likes him.

222
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
He holds the endives
as if they were precious,..

223
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
..'cause he likes a job well done.

224
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
-Come on, look at him!

225
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
It's as if he's picking up
a bird that's fallen from the nest!

226
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
You're lucky you
don't want grapes,..

227
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
..you'd have gotten it on Monday!

228
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Come on, move, you retard!

229
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,800
The lady has other things to do!

230
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,000
Right.

231
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Go and see my mother.

232
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
She's got
a memory like an elephant.

233
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Mum-ephant!

234
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
-Thanks.

235
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
-Bredoteau.

236
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
-Excuse me ?

237
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
-That's the name you're looking for.
But it doesn't count if I say it,..

238
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
..I am senile.

239
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
-Don't listen to him,
he's senile.

240
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Look at my oleanders!
-Why, what?

241
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,400
-Before the grocery,
he used to be a ticket puncher.

242
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,000
-What's wrong with that?!

243
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
-At night, he gets up..

244
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
..and punches my oleanders!

245
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
-I'd have preferred lilacs.
But that's life!

246
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Everyone his way to calm down!

247
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
-With me, it's ducks and drakes!

248
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
- Ducks and drakes!
- There you are !

249
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I write down everything.

250
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
-You write down what?

251
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
-Your son's almost 50.

252
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
And I still do his accounting!

253
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
-When he was 15, you still got his
toothbrush ready! That's the result!

254
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
-So, Camus, 2nd on the right...

255
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
-No, that's not it!

256
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
-No, staircase B,
that was Brossard...

257
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
That's it, I've got it!

258
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Bredoteau, 5th on the right.

259
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
They were from the Pas-de-Calais.
-Bredoteau...

260
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
That's all I have to say!

261
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
-This young man who rummages
about under the photo machine..

262
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
..is called Nino Quincampoix.

263
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,400
Amélie was denied the company
of other children,..

264
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:19,400
..but little Nino,
would rather have done without.

265
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Often, at the same moment,
9 km away from each other,..

266
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,800
..one was dreaming about a sister
and the other about a brother,..

267
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:37,800
..with whom they'd play
all the time.

268
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
-Hello, dad.

269
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,400
Made yourself a new friend?

270
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,000
-No, I've had it for ages.

271
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
But since your mother
hated it,..

272
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
..I had put it away in the shed.
Let's reconcile them with each other.

273
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
There! Not bad, eh?

274
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
-Say, dad.

275
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
If you found something from
your childhood, a treasure for you,..

276
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
..would it make you happy, sad,
nostalgic? How would you feel?

277
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
-I didn't have the dwarf
when I was a kid.

278
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
It was a present
when I retired.

279
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
-No, the things you keep a secret
as if it was of great value.

280
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
-I should varnish it
before the fall.

281
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
-I'm gonna make tea.
Do you want some?

282
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
-Don't move.

283
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
-You're OK? Better?

284
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,400
-Hey, close the door !

285
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,000
-It's not like Siberia.

286
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
-You're not allergic
to carbon monoxyde!

287
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I coughed so much last night
that my pleural membrane almost broke!

288
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
-Yes, of course!
-What's the menu today?

289
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
-Endive "au gratin"

290
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
-They'll bring you to your knees.

291
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
-So they're good?
-Depends on where you fall...

292
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,000
True, if it's in the toilet..
-They're no good!

293
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
-12.15am, burst of laughter
reminiscent of an orgasm..

294
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
..to please the dominating male.

295
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
-I can't take it anymore.
-Yes, true.

296
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Why does he insists?

297
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
There's other bars!

298
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
-Goodbye.
Mrs Suzanne !

299
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
-Yes ?

300
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,560
-Is there béchamel sauce,
in your endives?

301
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,000
-Of course, why?

302
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
-Béchamel sauce
doesn't agree with me.

303
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Just like horse-meat for you.

304
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
-That's got nothing to do
with digestion, but with memories.

305
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I'd rather eat
human flesh.

306
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
-Come on!

307
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
-Mrs Suzanne ?

308
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Can I leave earlier today?

309
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
-What's his name?

310
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
-Dominique Bredoteau.

311
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
-Hello !

312
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
-Dominique Bredoteau ?

313
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
-Yes...

314
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Can I help you?
-Well... It's for the petition.

315
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
-The petition ?

316
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,000
-Yes... The pétition... for...

317
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,000
For the canonization of Lady Di.

318
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,000
-O, yes. Er, no, thanks!

319
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
-Hello!
*-Yes?

320
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Dominique Bredoteau ? It's for the census
of the European Union.

321
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
*-Come up. 3rd floor.

322
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Hello, kitten.

323
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Earl Grey ? Bergamot ? Jasmine ?

324
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Can I offer you
something to drink?

325
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
-No. I have work to do.

326
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
-Yes, yes! Coming!

327
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
-Good afternoon, madam.
I'm looking for Dominique Bredoteau.

328
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,000
-Oh, my poor girl!
You've just missed him.

329
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
See, he's coming down.

330
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
-Bretodeau.

331
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Not Bredoteau.

332
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
You look like you can use
some hot wine with cinnamon. Come in!

333
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,000
-I've lived here for five years now,
it's the 1st time bump into you.

334
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
-I never come out.

335
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I don't want to meet
just anybody.

336
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
And there's only rascals out there!

337
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
But come in. There. Come in...

338
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
You know,
They call me the cristal man.

339
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,000
But my name
is Raymond Dufayel.

340
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,000
Amélie Poulain..
I'm a waitress...

341
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
-At the "Deux Moulins", I know.
And you're coming back empty-handed..

342
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
..from your hunt for Bretodeau.

343
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Because it's not "do",
it's "to".

344
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Like "toto".
-Thanks.

345
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I really like this painting.

346
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
-It's "The rower's lunch".

347
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,000
By Renoir.

348
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
I paint one every year,
for 20 years now.

349
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,000
The hardest is the eyes.

350
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Sometimes, they change
their moods on purpose,..

351
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
..when I'm not looking.

352
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
-They look happy here.
-They better be!

353
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
This year, they had
 hare with morel..

354
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
..and waffles with jam
for the children.

355
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Let's see, where did I put..

356
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
..that little note?

357
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I see you're looking at
my camera at the window.

358
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
It's a gift from my sister-in-law.

359
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Oh, I just put it there, this way..

360
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
..no need to wind up
my clock anymore.

361
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
After all these years,..

362
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,000
..the only character I
can't quite figure out,..

363
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
..is the girl with the glass of water.
She's in the middle..

364
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
..and yet, outside.

365
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,000
-Maybe she's just
different from the others.

366
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
-How different?

367
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
-I don't know.

368
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,000
-As a kid, maybe she didn't often
play with other children.

369
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Maybe even never...

370
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Here you are.

371
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Dominique Bretodeau.
27, rue Mouffetard.

372
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
It's for you.

373
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
-This morning,
like every Tuesday,..

374
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
..Dominique Bretodeau goes out
to buy a chicken.

375
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Usually, he cooks it in the oven
with baked potatoes.

376
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
After cutting off the legs,
the breast and the wings,..

377
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,000
..he'll clean up the bones
with his fingers,..

378
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
..starting with the oyster.

379
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
No, Bretodeau won't buy..

380
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
..a chicken today.

381
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
He won't go any further..

382
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,000
than that telephone booth.
There...

383
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000
-In one second, Bretodeau
remembers everything.

384
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Bahamontes' victory
in the Tour de France 1959...

385
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Aunt Josette's corselets...

386
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
And, especially,
that tragic day..

387
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,000
..when he won all the marbles
of his classmates during playtime.

388
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,000
-Bretodeau !

389
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
-Bretodeau !!

390
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
The Claw, Bretodeau !
Does he know it, the claw?

391
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,000
-One cognac, please.

392
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
I can't believe,
what just happened to me.

393
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,000
It must've been my guardian angel.
Can't be anything else.

394
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
It's as if
the telephone booth was calling me..

395
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,000
..it rang, and rang...

396
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,000
-Well my,
there's the microwave calling!

397
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,000
-Can I have another cognac?

398
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,000
It's weird, life.

399
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
When you're a kid,
time creeps slowly and then one day,..

400
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
..you're 50.

401
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
And childhood,
whatever's left of it,..

402
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
..fits into
a little rusty box.

403
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
You don't have children
yet, do you,..

404
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,000
..miss?

405
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,000
I have a daughter.
She must be about your age.

406
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,000
We haven't spoken to each
 other for years now.

407
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
I heard she has a child,
a little boy.

408
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,000
His name is Lucas.

409
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,000
It's about time
I went to pay them a visit..

410
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
..before I end up in a box myself.

411
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Don't you think?

412
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,000
-Amélie suddenly feels
in perfect harmony with herself.

413
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
everything's perfect:
the softness of the light,..

414
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,000
..that little scent in the air,
the peaceful sounds of the city...

415
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Life seems so simple
and cristal-clear that she's swept..

416
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,000
..by this desire to help
the all mankind.

417
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
-I'll help you.
We go down and there we go!

418
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
There's the widow
of the drummer of the brass band.

419
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Hey, the horse's lost one ear!

420
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
The husband of florist is laughing.

421
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,000
There's lollipops
in the shop window!

422
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Can you smell his scent?

423
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,000
This man is offering melon
to his clients to taste.

424
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
There, they make
wonderful ice-cream!

425
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
We're passing
in front of the butcher's.

426
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Ham on the bone costs 79 !

427
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Here we're at the cheese merchant's...

428
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
12,90 for a Picodon d'Ardèche !
At the butcher's,..

429
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
..a baby's looking at a dog,
that's looking at the chicken.

430
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Here you are, now
we're at the metro station.

431
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,000
I'll leave you here, goodbye.

432
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,000
"She was never able to enter
into relationships with others..."

433
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
"As a kid, she was
always on her own."

434
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,000
*-On the evening of a bright
day in July,..

435
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,000
..while holiday-makers
enjoy themselves on the beach..

436
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
..in the carefreeness of the
sunny days and while in Paris,..

437
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,000
..the strollers, overcome by the heat
gaze at the trails of smoke..

438
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
..of the fireworks,..

439
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
..Amélie Poulain, also known
as "the godmother of the rejected",..

440
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,000
..or "the madonna of the cast-offs"
succumbs to exhaustion.

441
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
In the streets of Paris,
struck with grief,..

442
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,000
..millions of mourning anonyms
gather for the funeral cortège..

443
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
..to show in silence..

444
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,000
..their great sorrow
of being forever orphans.

445
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
What a strange fate,
that of this young woman..

446
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
..deprived of herself,..

447
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,000
..yet so sensitive to the charm
of the little things in life.

448
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Like Don Quichotte,
she was determined to grapple..

449
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,000
..the unforgiving grinder
of all the human sorrows.

450
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,000
An impossible fight
that consumed..

451
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,000
..her life prematurely.
At 23, Amélie Poulain..

452
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,000
..let her life deteriorate
in the swirls of universal pain.

453
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,000
And there she was struck by the regret
of having let her father die,..

454
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,000
..without ever being able to give
back to this suffocated man..

455
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,000
..the breath of air
she'd been able to give..

456
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,000
..to so many others.

457
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:39,000
-Hey, Mister !

458
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Hey, Mister !

459
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Sir !!

460
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Wait!

461
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Wait!!

462
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,000
-Pages
full of failed identity photos..

463
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
..that their owners had
thrown away..

464
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,000
..and that had been re-assembled
and classified by some eccentric.

465
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Some family-album!

466
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
-One Gauloises blondes.

467
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,000
-There's so much smoke.
Where are they?

468
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
I can't see anything.
-More to the left.

469
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,000
A bit further. There you are.
-There? Thanks.

470
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Where are my 1F coins?

471
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Never mind.

472
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,000
-Yes?
-One Moresque.

473
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,000
On Kir, one Moresque
and two and 2 peppermint cordials.

474
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,000
-That cooing, is it pre-nuptial
or post-coital ?

475
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,000
-And your bloody stupidity,
is it congenital?

476
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
-Pre-nuptial.
-Don't worry.

477
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
You'll find the right one in the end.

478
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,000
They all dream about sleeping
on a man's shoulder.

479
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,000
-I wouldn't mind,
but men snore.

480
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
I have a sensitive ear!

481
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
-I was operated, I got rid of it.

482
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
-How romantic !

483
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,000
-It's clear you've never known
true love.

484
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,000
-If I hadn't known it, they wouldn't
have shortened my right leg.

485
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
-Wasn't it a horse?

486
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
-Yes, precisely.

487
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
I was in love
with a trapeze artist.

488
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
I should've known, they dump you
at the last moment!

489
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
He dumped me
as I was going into the circus ring.

490
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,000
I was so upset,
and as a result, so was the horse.

491
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Unfortunately, I was under it!

492
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Right ! The Moresque.

493
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
-Love at first sight, it does exists.

494
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,000
-I'm not sayin' it doesn't.
But after 30 years behind the bar,..

495
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,000
..I can even give you the recipe!

496
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Take two regulars, make them
believe they like each other,..

497
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
..let it simmer..

498
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,000
..works every time.

499
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,000
-Excuse me!

500
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Excuse me!

501
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
-No !
-I'll go.

502
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Don't you think you've done
enough harm already?

503
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,000
-Gina's old enough to
defend herself.

504
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,000
-I'm not thinking about Gina,
but about Georgette.

505
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
-Georgette ?

506
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
-Open your eyes !
She's hoping for you..

507
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,000
..and you're only looking at Gina !

508
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Poor thing !
Look at all she's doing..

509
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,000
..to try and attract
your attention.

510
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:47,000
You're blind !

511
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,000
-I'm off, I have a date.
Bye!

512
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

513
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
I don't know
how the new one will be,..

514
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,000
..but'll never be worse than
that freak there with his tape recorder.

515
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,000
-Joseph's not really a freak.

516
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
He's hurting, that's all.

517
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
-It's been two months
since they broke up,..

518
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
..and he still shows up every day.
He likes to suffer !

519
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,000
-Don't tell me you
haven't noticed anything?

520
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
-What do you mean ?

521
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:27,000
-He always sits there?
-Well, yes.

522
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
-Sit down.

523
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Sit down, Georgette.

524
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
What can you see, from here?
-My shop.

525
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,000
-And there's nothing missing?
-Well, no.

526
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:45,000
-Think harder.

527
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
-Well, no.
Really, I can't see!

528
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,000
-I'll let you think about it.
Good night.

529
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Good morning...

530
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,000
"A Swiss octogenarian has received
a letter 30 years later.

531
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,000
"The mail was found by
mountaineers on the Mont-Blanc,..

532
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,000
"..in a bag
of the Malabar Princess,..

533
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,000
..a plane that crashed
at the end of the 60ies."

534
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,000
-What a pity !
Such a young and pretty princess...

535
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
-You mean, old and ugly,
that wouldn't have been that bad?

536
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,000
-Well, yes... Look at Mother Theresa.

537
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
And him?
Still after Gina ?

538
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
-No, after somebody else.

539
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,000
-Tell me,
is it someone I know ?

540
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,000
-Yes. It's funny,
that story about the mountaineers.

541
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,000
-Somebody from the Deux Moulins ?
Not you!

542
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
-No !

543
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,000
-Not Mme Suzanne...

544
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
No !

545
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,000
-Yes !

546
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Look, he's there again.
-Yes... How strange.

547
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,000
-And here.
-"Still him."

548
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Lyon Station.

549
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
-And here, again.

550
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
March 5, Austerlitz.

551
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
-And still the same expression.

552
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Isn't it ? So neutral.

553
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
-12 times in total.

554
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,000
I counted.
It's strange, isn't it?

555
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Why would he go across the whole
town to take photographs,..

556
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
..and then throw them away?

557
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,000
-Especially since they're
 in perfect condition!

558
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,000
-Looks like some sort of ritual.

559
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
-Maybe he's obsessed..

560
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,000
..by the fear of getting old
and this is his way to relax.

561
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
-He's dead!

562
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
-Dead?

563
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,000
-He's afraid
of being forgotten.

564
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,000
He uses those machines
to remind the living of his face.

565
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:01,000
As if he were faxing
his image from the hereafter.

566
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,000
-A dead man who'd be
afraid of being forgotten...

567
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Well, these ones don't
have to worry about that!

568
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
They died long time ago.

569
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:15,000
But they'll
never be forgotten.

570
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:19,000
You know,
that girl with the glass,..

571
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,000
..maybe she's thinking about someone.

572
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,000
-Somebody on the picture?

573
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
-No.

574
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Rather a young man
she saw some place else.

575
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:33,000
She feels like they're
the same, the two of 'em.

576
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:37,000
-She prefers to imagine a relationship
with somebody who's away,..

577
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
..than to create bonds with..

578
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
..those who are there?

579
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,000
-No...

580
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Maybe she's doing everything she can
to sort out other people's lives.

581
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:55,000
-But her ?

582
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Her life,..

583
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
..who's going to take care of that?

584
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
-In the meantime,..

585
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:05,000
..it's better to devote yourself
to others than to a garden-dwarf.

586
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:17,000
-2,8 g of alcohol in his blood
for a chauffeur!

587
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,000
I'm not the only one to employ
an irresponsible moron.

588
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
-M. Collignon.

589
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Your keys...
-Just a minute!

590
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
No rush!

591
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Look at Lucien.

592
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,000
At work, there's no chance
he'll exceed the speed limits.  Is there?

593
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
-You shouldn't, M. Collignon.

594
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,000
It's not his fault.

595
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
-You're right.

596
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:43,000
It's not his fault,
it's Lady Di's fault !

597
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Do you know
what I found this morning?..

598
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,000
..The 3 Suisses catalogue
open at the page with the nighties.

599
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:53,000
He'd stuck the picture of Lady Di
on the bodies of the models.

600
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:57,000
So, this time,
a bunch of asparagus,..

601
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
..or the neighbourhood records?

602
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:03,000
-Nothing.

603
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:13,720
"KEYS WHILE YOU WAIT"

604
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,000
-Thanks. Well, looks like those
migraines are gone.

605
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:31,000
-Yes, but I haven't slept all
night because of my sciatic nerve.

606
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
-You're looking good !

607
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
-Really ?

608
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,000
-A woman without love, it's
like a flower without sun. It dies.

609
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,000
-Strange weather today!

610
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Did I say something wrong?

611
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,000
-No.
Everyone gives me the weather forecast.

612
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,000
-Talking about the weather
to forget that time goes by.

613
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,000
-No, to avoid talking nonsense.

614
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
-You can write nonsense,
but not publish it...

615
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,000
-Still nothing?
-30th rejection.

616
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,000
-What about your cousin, the critic?
-What do you think?

617
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
They're like the cactus..

618
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,000
..they live to sting...
-And your book ?

619
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Is it a love-story ?

620
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,000
-No, it's about a guy
who keeps a diary.

621
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
But instead of writing it
as things happen,..

622
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,000
..he writes the worst-case scenario
beforehand.

623
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,000
As a result, he's depressed,
and he doesn't do anything.

624
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,400
-It's the story of a guy
who doesn't do anything.

625
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,000
-Look, Mme Suzanne,..

626
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
..I'll sign you the manuscript.

627
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,800
-Yes, and you forget
about his bill.

628
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:39,800
-I exchange his masterpieces
for my "pièces-de-résistance!"

629
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
-Here you are.
-Thanks.

630
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,000
-Thanks, Mme Suzanne.

631
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,000
-How long
did it take you?

632
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Have you seen the time?
Jesus, this one,..

633
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:56,000
..they never got him finished!

634
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:53,000
"Without you,
my feelings of the present..."

635
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
-"Without you,
my feelings of the present...

636
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
"..would only be like the dead skin..

637
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:01,000
"..of the des feelings of the past."
-Excuse me?

638
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,000
-Without you, the feelings of the present
would only be the dead skin..

639
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
..of the feelings of the past.

640
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,000
-Ticket, please.

641
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,000
-And...

642
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Your job then?
-You already asked.

643
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,000
-Yes, yes...

644
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:23,000
You're well, right now?
-Rather well.

645
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:28,520
Something's changing.

646
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:33,000
And I had 2 heart-attacks,
I had to get an abortion,..

647
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,600
..coz I was on crack when pregnant.

648
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:38,000
Besides that, everything's OK.

649
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
-So much the better.

650
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:44,000
So much the better...
-Is something wrong ?

651
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:50,000
-No, no, nothing...

652
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:54,000
-Your garden dwarf is gone ?

653
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Is he back
in the shed?

654
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,000
-Moscow and there. Nothing.

655
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
No explanation.

656
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:19,000
-Maybe he wanted to travel around.

657
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:24,000
-I don't get it.

658
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:28,000
I don't get it.

659
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:41,000
"LOST: North Station
saddlebag containing a

660
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:45,000
PHOTO ALBUM. Please
contact me: 0148872257"

661
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:49,000
-A normal girl would take
the chance to call him right away.

662
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:54,000
She'd meet him and would soon know
whether it's worth a shot or no.

663
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,000
That's called facing reality
But that's precisely,..

664
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:02,000
..what Amélie doesn't want.

665
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
-Isn't she..

666
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:10,000
..falling in love ?

667
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:36,000
-And for you, ladies?

668
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
-Some leek and two globe artichokes.

669
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,000
-Where's your boss ?

670
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
-Ssst !

671
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
He's asleep in the cauliflowers.

672
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
-What ?!?

673
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
-He's asleep in the cauliflowers.

674
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:53,000
-Oh, right...

675
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
-Can I help you ?

676
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:02,000
-One Tac-O-Tac, please.

677
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
-Here you are.

678
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:11,000
-It's the first time,
I don't know how it works.

679
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
-Listen,..

680
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:18,000
..we'll do one together.

681
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:23,000
So you have to scratch there..

682
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:27,000
..from left to right.

683
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
There. Well, nothing. You ?

684
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:39,000
-No, nothing as well.

685
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:43,000
No luck in games...

686
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:46,000
-Yes ! That's what they say !

687
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:50,000
-Ok, right ! I've got to get back.

688
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:55,000
-Yes. Off you go...

689
00:57:56,600 --> 00:58:00,600
*-Palace Video, King of Porn.

690
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:02,600
-Good morning, I call about the add.

691
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:05,600
*-You're of age?
-Yes.

692
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:08,600
* You're shaved?
-Excuse me ?

693
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:12,600
*-I'm asking because
hairy legs,..

694
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:17,600
..it scares off the clients.

695
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:35,600
-How're you doing, Mrs Walace ?

696
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:35,600
-O, when you don't expect
 much from life anymore...

697
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:40,800
-Don't say that, Life's beautiful.
-Really?

698
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:56,900
-Hello, M. Dufayel.

699
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:59,800
-Hello, Lucien.

700
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:01,600
-Here's what you asked for,
 M. Dufayel.

701
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:04,000
-I doubt it. I hate artichoke.

702
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:08,000
-You shouldn't.
Let me show you.

703
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:17,600
Take it... Surprise !

704
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:21,600
-Well, I prefer that!

705
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:32,600
-Watch this...

706
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:34,600
-You're a magician !

707
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:37,600
-All on M. Collignon !

708
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:40,600
-Who ?

709
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:43,600
M. Collignon ? Lucien !!

710
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:45,600
-I wasn't thinking, M. Dufayel.

711
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:47,600
-Exercise, Lucien my boy!

712
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:49,600
-No...
-Exercise !!

713
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:53,600
-Repeat after me.
Collignon, you little rascal.

714
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:57,600
-Collignon, you little rascal.
-Yes, that's it!

715
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:00,600
Your turn now. Collignon...

716
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:04,600
-Collignon, shit-face.
-Well, good!

717
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:09,400
You see, when you set your mind to it.
Come on, Collignon...

718
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:11,600
-Collignon, dog-face !

719
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:14,600
-Very good ! Collignon...

720
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:18,600
-Collignon, shit-face !
Collignon, dog-face !

721
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:23,400
Collignon, shit-face !!
Collignon, dog-face !!

722
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:24,600
No, no !

723
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:28,600
-Lucien !!
-Collignon eats dirt!

724
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:30,600
Enough for today !!

725
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:33,600
That's enough for today.

726
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:35,600
It's very good.

727
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:39,600
-M. Dufayel. I found this
under your doormat.

728
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:48,600
Collignon, dog-face!

729
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:55,600
-Still nothing.

730
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:58,600
-Still nothing here too.

731
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:02,600
-Do you mind ?
 you have something, there.

732
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,600
you're beautiful, Georgette,..

733
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:14,200
..when you blush.

734
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:16,600
You look like a wild flower.

735
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:19,600
-It's my allergy...

736
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:22,600
-Good morning everybody.

737
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:26,600
Nice weather today.

738
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:45,000
-A packet of Gitane...

739
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:48,600
-Bravo! Well done!
Look at me now!

740
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:52,600
Straight A!!
Perfect shot!

741
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:59,600
It's Amélie who...

742
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:34,600
-You know,
when they climbed the Mont-Blanc,..

743
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:38,600
..with the cold,
the silicone froze...

744
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:10,600
-A little glass of hot wine
with some ginger bread.

745
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:11,600
-Thanks.

746
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:15,600
-I think I was a bit rude
with the girl with the glass.

747
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:20,600
Tell me, the boy she met
did she see him again?

748
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:22,600
-No.

749
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:26,600
In fact, they're not interested
in the same things.

750
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:29,600
-You know, opportunities are
like the Tour de France,..

751
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:33,600
..you wait a long time for it
and it goes by quickly.

752
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:37,600
When the right time comes, you
have to jump the fence without hesitation.

753
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:02,600
-Hi, Can I help you?
-Excuse me.

754
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:06,600
I found this on the pavement...
-My god!

755
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:09,000
Nino's gonna be so happy.

756
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:12,600
I almost went to church to
burn a candle to Saint Anthony

757
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:15,600
-Is Nino there?

758
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:17,600
-Never on Wednesdays.
He works at the Trône Fair.

759
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:21,600
-Oh, right. And has he been
collecting these for a long time?

760
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:26,600
-For a year now.
I found him a job here.

761
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:28,600
Before, he collected footprints.

762
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:30,600
He used to be a nigh watchman.

763
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:34,600
He took pictures of footprints
in fresh cement.

764
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:39,600
He's an odd sort.

765
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:40,600
He also acted as..

766
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:42,600
..Santa Clause at the Samaritaine.

767
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:46,600
And then, he recorded laughter
when he heard funny ones.

768
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:57,600
-It mustn't always be easy
for his girlfriend.

769
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
-They never stayed !

770
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,600
Times are hard
for dreamers.

771
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:05,800
-Where are those coffees, Eva?

772
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:08,600
-I gotta go. Thanks for the album.

773
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:11,600
-I'll bring it to him
at the Trône Fair.

774
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:15,600
-Ok. He's at the Carpathian Dungeon,
ask for Nino Quincampoix.

775
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:41,600
-Good morning. Is Nino there ?

776
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:44,600
-He doesn't come out till 7pm.

777
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:48,600
-Can't I see him before ?
-Sure.

778
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:52,600
It's 20 F.

779
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:26,600
-Hooooooooooooo...

780
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:31,600
Hooooooooooo...

781
01:07:57,600 --> 01:08:01,600
-I'm off. See you on Wednesday.
-OK.

782
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:12,400
"Tomorrow, 5 PM
 Montmartre Carousel,

783
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:14,200
next to the telephone booth

784
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:18,200
Bring a 5F coin"

785
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:32,600
-Psst !

786
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:36,600
You'd like to know more,
 don't you?

787
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:40,600
-Did you see her?
-Of course.

788
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:42,600
We were in her pocket !

789
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:44,600
-close to her breast.

790
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:46,600
-Is she pretty ?

791
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:47,600
-Not bad.
-Not bad.

792
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:48,600
-Not bad.

793
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:50,600
-Beautiful.

794
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:51,600
-Pretty.
-No, beautiful.

795
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:52,600
-Pretty.

796
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:56,040
-What does she want from me?
-She's broke.

797
01:08:56,040 --> 01:08:58,600
She hopes for a reward.

798
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:00,600
-Or she collects identity photos too.

799
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:04,600
-Yes, she wants to exchange us for
a one-eyed man with glasses !

800
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:10,600
Of course not, stupid !

801
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:14,600
She's in love.
-I don't even know her.

802
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:17,600
-Yes you do !

803
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:19,600
-Since when ?

804
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:23,600
-Since forever.
In your dreams!

805
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:37,600
-Hello ? Yes. Sir!

806
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:41,600
You, with the plastic bag,
it's for you.

807
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:45,600
-Me ?
-Yes.

808
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:47,600
-Thanks.

809
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:50,600
Hello ?

810
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:54,600
-Follow the blue arrows,
M. Quincampoix.

811
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:58,600
-What ?

812
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:18,600
-When the finger points to heaven,
the idiot looks at the finger.

813
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:59,600
-Hey !!

814
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:28,600
-Hello ?

815
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:32,600
*-I know who the mystery man
of the photo machines is, M. Quincampoix.

816
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:36,600
He's a ghost, M. Quincampoix.
Nobody can see him.

817
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:39,600
He can only be seen
on photographs.

818
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:43,600
*When a girl has
her picture taken,..

819
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:45,600
..he moans: hooooooooooo...

820
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:48,600
While he softly caresses
her neck.

821
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:52,600
That's when he's caught by
the camera, M. Quincampoix !

822
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:56,600
-Who are you ?

823
01:12:56,600 --> 01:13:00,600
-Page 51.

824
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:07,760
"DO YOU"

825
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:09,320
"WISH"

826
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:13,320
"TO MEET ME"

827
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:46,600
-Listen to this.

828
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:50,600
"A six year old boy
left at night..

829
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:52,600
"..with his tricycle.

830
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:55,600
"He was found on a
motorway in Germany.

831
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:59,400
He just wanted to go
to where the stars are."

832
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:02,600
-Ah, life is so beautiful,
 don't you think ?

833
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:06,600
-The love virus...  she'd
never caught that one before!

834
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:09,000
-Nobody's safe!

835
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:13,000
-Well, I won't complain.
-She's looking great.

836
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:18,600
-How is she ?
Tall, short, blonde, brown?

837
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:23,600
-Well, let's say medium-size.

838
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:27,600
Not a midget, nor a giraffe.
Normal.

839
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:29,600
Pretty, in her own way.

840
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:32,600
But as for blonde or brown,
I can't say !

841
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:36,600
Hard to tell.
She certainly wasn't red.

842
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:39,600
Even though...
-Forget it.

843
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:43,600
-On the other hand, she did sort
of ask whether you had a girlfriend.

844
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:45,600
-And ?

845
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:48,600
-I said that you were not interested.
That's ok, isn't it?

846
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:52,600
-You didn't say that, did you ?
-You don't even know her !

847
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:57,600
-Exactly, it's the mystery.
-You won't find it here !

848
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:01,600
-Some nectarines, please.
-Those are much more beautiful.

849
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:04,600
-Mister here is an aesthete !

850
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:07,600
In the evening, he leaves
with the remainders,..

851
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:10,600
..I was getting worried.

852
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:13,600
But mister here takes
drawing classes !

853
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:16,600
During the day he sells leek,
and in the evening, he draws potatoes !

854
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:17,600
You're a real vegetable !!

855
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:19,600
-A real good street prompter..

856
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:23,600
..ready to prompt
a stinging retort,..

857
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:25,600
..That's the help shy people need.

858
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:29,600
-You, you'll never be
 a vegetable,..

859
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:33,600
..because even an artichoke
 has a heart.

860
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:37,600
-You'll never be a vegetable,
because even an artichoke has a heart.

gets more painful every day.

01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:44,600

I can't sleep, I can't eat."

"I made the biggest mistake
by accepting this training course..

from my wife for 5 weeks.

866

-One hour later,
boulevard Saint-Martin..

879
01:21:56,600 --> 01:22:00,600
..Amélie steps into
a jokes and costume shop.

880
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:04,600
At the same moment, a man
leaves his home at Lecourbe Street.

881
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:09,600
26 min later, Amélie arrives
at the photo machine at the Gare de l'Est.

882
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:14,600
At the same second,
the man in red trainers..

883
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:18,600
..parks in front
of the side entrance.

884
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:22,600
At that moment, it is
exactly 11.40am.

885
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:05,600
At this exact moment in the story,..

886
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:09,600
..Amélie is the only one
to know the key to the enigma..

887

-'Morning, Mrs Walace.
How are you ?

-Here, for you.
-For me ?

891

"Mrs Walace.

of a mailbag that was lost..

"..when a plane disappeared ,
on the 12th of October 1969.

M. Dufayel,..

908
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:06,600
..you know what happened
to the caretaker this morning ?

909
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:07,600
-A letter.

910
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:11,600
-From her husband.
40 years late.

911
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:17,600
Quite a long time,
isn't it, M. Dufayel ?

912
01:25:26,600 --> 01:25:30,600
That's 'cause I don't really like
still lifes, M. Dufayel.

913
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:34,600
-In the meantime,
take care over your light layer.

914
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:38,600
It's dark on light, always!

915
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:56,600
-M. Dufayel ?
-Yes!

916
01:25:56,600 --> 01:26:00,600
-The papers say that there's soon
gonna be a new star.

917
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:04,600
-You're interested in stars?

918
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:08,600
-I saw this show at my mum's,
 that's why.

919
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:11,600
but I dunno if it's true.

920
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:13,600
It's the les Americans...

921
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:17,600
They're gonna take the ashes
of rich dead people,..

922
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:21,600
..to put them in a satellite,
and send it into space.

923
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:25,600
And it's gonna shine forever,
the satellite.

924
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:31,600
And Lady Di ?
You think they're gonna do the same for her?

925
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:33,600
-Lady Di !!

926
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:37,600
You're getting on my nerves !!
I can't concentrate!!

927
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:42,600

01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:46,600

-Morning, sir.

-Cambodia...

931
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:43,600
I don't get that.

932
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:46,600
I don't get it!

933
01:28:46,600 --> 01:28:50,600
-That was wonderful!
You couldn't have done better.

934
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:53,600
-Did it work ?
-It's running it's course.

935
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:56,600
-Well, I'll do it again any time!
The harm is done anyway...

936
01:28:56,600 --> 01:28:57,600
-Quoi ?

937
01:28:57,600 --> 01:29:01,600
-They call me Snow White,
now!

938
01:29:57,160 --> 01:30:01,160
"bar 'les 2..."
"I am often..."

939
01:30:02,600 --> 01:30:04,600
"bar 'les 2 Moulins'
I am often there

940
01:30:04,600 --> 01:30:08,600
after 4 pm"

941
01:30:10,600 --> 01:30:13,400
-Eva ?
*-Yes ?

942
01:30:13,400 --> 01:30:17,400
-Could you take over at 4pm please ?

943
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:21,600
*-Oh, you're pushing it!

944
01:30:26,600 --> 01:30:28,600
-What's going on?

945
01:30:28,600 --> 01:30:31,600
Is he sulking?
-He thinks I smile too much.

946
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:35,600
-He prefers when it when you frown?
-With other men, yes.

947
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:41,600
-Nino's late. For Amélie,
there's only two possible explanations

948
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:44,600
1. He didn't find the picture.

949
01:30:44,600 --> 01:30:48,600
2. He didn't have time to piece it together..

950
01:30:48,600 --> 01:30:52,600
..because 3 repeat offenders
took him hostage.

951
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:55,600
Chased by the police,..

952
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:56,600
..they managed to escape.

953
01:30:56,600 --> 01:30:59,600
But he caused an accident.

954
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:03,600
When he recovered,
he couldn't remember anything.

955
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:07,600
A trucker gave him a ride..

956
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:11,600
..and believing that he is a fugitive,
put him in a container to Istanbul.

957
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:14,600
There, he came across
Afghan adventurers,..

958
01:31:14,600 --> 01:31:18,600
..who took him with them
to steal soviet missiles.

959
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:24,600
But their lorry exploded
on a landmine in Tajikistan.

960
01:31:24,600 --> 01:31:27,600
The only survivor, mountaineers
helped him out,..

961
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:29,600
..and he became
a mujaheddin fighter.

962
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:32,600
Thus, Amélie really doesn't see
why she should worry so much..

963
01:31:32,600 --> 01:31:34,600
..for a guy who'll spend the
rest of his life eating bortsch,..

964
01:31:34,600 --> 01:31:38,600
..with a stupid hat
 on his head !

965
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:58,600
-Hi, what can I get you?
-A coffee, please.

966
01:31:58,600 --> 01:32:02,600
-One coffee!

967
01:32:20,600 --> 01:32:24,600
Here's your coffee.

968
01:32:24,600 --> 01:32:28,600
-Thanks.

969
01:32:58,600 --> 01:33:00,600
-Now, he's understood.

970
01:33:00,600 --> 01:33:04,600
He's going to put down his spoon...

971
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:09,600
and pick up the sugar
on the table with his finger.

972
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:16,600
Then he'll turn around..

973
01:33:16,600 --> 01:33:20,600
..and then, he'll talk to me.

974
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:25,600
-Excuse me !

975
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:29,600
Is this you ?

976
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:35,600
Yes, that's you.

977
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:59,600
-Let me clear the table for you.

978
01:33:59,600 --> 01:34:01,600
Another coffee?

979
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:05,600
-No, thanks. I'm fine.

980
01:34:22,600 --> 01:34:26,600
-So that's the one, there,
the guy who raises his hand?

981
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:31,600
-Yes.

982
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:35,600
-Is she in love with him?

983
01:34:36,600 --> 01:34:38,600
-Yes.

984
01:34:38,600 --> 01:34:42,600
-The time has come for her
to take some real risks.

985
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:47,600
-Well yes, she's thinking about it.
She's thinking of a stratagem...

986
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:51,600
-Yes, she likes stratagems,
doesn't she !

987
01:34:52,600 --> 01:34:55,600
-Yes.

988
01:34:55,600 --> 01:34:57,600
She's a bit of a coward.

989
01:34:57,600 --> 01:35:01,600
That's why I have trouble
with her eyes.

990
01:35:04,120 --> 01:35:07,000
"Raymond Dufayel's meddling..

991
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:11,000
"..is intolerable!

992
01:35:11,560 --> 01:35:14,560
"If Amélie prefers to..

993
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:17,240
"live in a dream-world..

"and live her whole life

"Because...

996
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:26,800
"..making a mess of your life
is an indefeasible right!"

997
01:35:58,600 --> 01:36:02,200
-What are you doing, M. Dufayel ?

998
01:36:02,200 --> 01:36:04,600
-Tell me, Lucien my boy,..

999
01:36:04,600 --> 01:36:07,600
..for your deliveries,..

1000
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:11,600
..do you still have the keys
of the other tenants ?

1001
01:36:22,600 --> 01:36:26,600
-good morning, sir.
One of your machines is out of order.

1002
01:36:26,600 --> 01:36:30,600
Er... No, but I think
there's something stuck.

-No, thanks.

1009
01:37:13,360 --> 01:37:17,360
"Can you..."

1010
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:20,680
"Can you take over from me this afternoon?"

1011

-Just a second, I've finished.

1014
01:38:40,600 --> 01:38:44,600
-The mystery man of the
photo machines wasn't a ghost,..

1015
01:38:44,600 --> 01:38:47,600
..nor somebody obsessed by the fear
of ageing, but the repairman.

1016
01:38:47,600 --> 01:38:51,600
Just a technician
doing his job. That's all.

1017
01:38:52,600 --> 01:38:56,600
-Excuse me...

1018
01:39:36,600 --> 01:39:40,600
-He's watching me like a dog.
It drives me crazy.

of feminine conspiracy.

1020
01:39:45,600 --> 01:39:48,600
-Ow, you look tense, Georgette,
you look tense.

1021
01:39:48,600 --> 01:39:52,600
Courage, it's not easy.

1022
01:39:57,600 --> 01:39:58,600
-Excuse me.

1023
01:39:58,600 --> 01:40:02,600
Is this yours?
-Yes, but it's not me who...

1024
01:40:02,600 --> 01:40:04,600
-I know it's not you.
Where can I find her ?

1025
01:40:04,600 --> 01:40:05,600
-She's at her father's.

1026
01:40:05,600 --> 01:40:09,600
It bothers me, I'd like to
talk to you. I finish at 6.

1027
01:40:10,600 --> 01:40:13,600
Can  you drop by ?
-Sure.

1028
01:40:13,600 --> 01:40:14,600
-See you later.

1029
01:40:14,600 --> 01:40:18,600
-There you are, 4.08pm.
The trap is set.

1030
01:40:48,600 --> 01:40:51,600
-And the blond guy, with
the camelhair jacket?

1031
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:55,600
He's absent-minded too ?
-What do you mean ?

1032
01:40:55,600 --> 01:40:58,600
-He also came back 3 times.

1033
01:40:58,600 --> 01:41:00,600
1.12 pm...

1034
01:41:00,600 --> 01:41:03,600
"Camelhair".
2.50 pm...

1035
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:05,600
"Camelhair".

1036
01:41:05,600 --> 01:41:07,600
4.17 pm... "Camelhair"...
-Stop it!!!

1037
01:41:07,600 --> 01:41:11,600
My red patches are appearing,
again. Look!

1038
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:15,600
Mrs Suzanne, It starts again!!
He's gonna drive me crazy!

1039
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:17,600
-Don't start again!

1040
01:41:17,600 --> 01:41:21,600
-If she had a clear conscience
she wouldn't be upset.

1041
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:23,600
-I'm going home!

1042
01:41:23,600 --> 01:41:27,600
A psycho !!
That's the limit!

1043
01:41:27,600 --> 01:41:28,600
-Georgette !

1044
01:41:28,600 --> 01:41:31,600
Are you done, suffocating them
like that?

1045
01:41:31,600 --> 01:41:34,600
A woman needs space to breathe.

1046
01:41:34,600 --> 01:41:37,600
-Yes, and then,
she goes elsewhere.

1047
01:41:37,600 --> 01:41:39,600
-It can be good sometimes!

1048
01:41:39,600 --> 01:41:42,600
-Oh you, the writing failure!

1049
01:41:42,600 --> 01:41:45,600
-Yes... writing failure,
a failure...

1050
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:47,600
I like this word: "failure".

1051
01:41:47,600 --> 01:41:50,600
That's human destiny.
-He's getting pedantic!

1052
01:41:50,600 --> 01:41:54,600
Failure after failure,
you make drafts and nothing more.

1053
01:41:54,600 --> 01:41:58,600
Life's only an
 endless repetition.

1054
01:41:59,600 --> 01:42:01,600
-Yeah, right!
He didn't even come up with that himself!

1055
01:42:01,600 --> 01:42:05,600
-I do have ideas on my own, you know.

1056
01:42:05,600 --> 01:42:09,600
People always steal them from me.
A bit like you with women.

1057
01:42:09,600 --> 01:42:11,600
-What does that mean?

1058
01:42:11,600 --> 01:42:14,600
-Maybe you should
resign yourself.

1059
01:42:14,600 --> 01:42:16,600
-Mind your own business, you...

1060
01:42:16,600 --> 01:42:19,600
-Yes, what, eh ?!?
-Stop it!

1061
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:22,600
-What's going on here?

1062
01:42:22,600 --> 01:42:26,600
-Georgette wanted to go for a walk
and Joseph makes a fuss.

1063
01:42:26,600 --> 01:42:27,600
-A walk, right!

1064
01:42:27,600 --> 01:42:31,600
Yes, like Gina
and the guy with the plastic bag...

1065
01:42:32,600 --> 01:42:36,600
Hold on, I saw the whole process.

1066
01:42:36,600 --> 01:42:39,600
First the little note in the pocket

1067
01:42:39,600 --> 01:42:43,600
At 4.08 pm. So the guy comes back
today and there you go !

1068
01:42:43,600 --> 01:42:47,600
They go for a walk.

1069
01:42:48,600 --> 01:42:51,600
-The problem is,
you look nice to me.

1070
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:52,600
-Which means?

1071
01:42:52,600 --> 01:42:56,600
-The more I like a guy,
the less he's structured mentally.

1072
01:42:56,600 --> 01:43:00,600
I'd like to know more.
-Ask me questions.

1073
01:43:01,600 --> 01:43:04,600
-What doesn't a swallow make?

1074
01:43:04,600 --> 01:43:08,600
-A swallow ?
A summer.

1075
01:43:08,600 --> 01:43:11,600
-And clothes?
-The man.

1076
01:43:11,600 --> 01:43:12,600
-When the cat's away...
-The mice will play.

1077
01:43:12,600 --> 01:43:14,600
-Slow and steady...
-Wins the race.

1078
01:43:14,600 --> 01:43:16,600
-A rolling stone...
-Gathers no moss.

1079
01:43:16,600 --> 01:43:18,600
-He that will steal a penny...
-Will steal a pound.

1080
01:43:18,600 --> 01:43:21,600
-Out of sight...
-Out of mind.

1081
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:24,600
-Not bad!
-More ?

1082
01:43:24,600 --> 01:43:28,600
-I think that those who know the proverbs
can't be bad persons.

1083
01:43:29,600 --> 01:43:33,600
-Oh, the pretty girl
from the 5th floor !

1084
01:43:33,600 --> 01:43:37,600
I've got to tell you.
Do you believe in miracles?

1085
01:43:37,600 --> 01:43:40,600
-Not today, no.

1086
01:43:40,600 --> 01:43:42,600
-You'll be surprised

1087
01:43:42,600 --> 01:43:45,600
Some mountaineers..

1088
01:43:45,600 --> 01:43:49,600
..on the Mont-Blanc
discovered...

1089
01:44:24,600 --> 01:44:27,600
-Hi Lucien.
Do you have yeast?

1090
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:29,600
-Is it for Miss Amélie ?
-Yes.

1091
01:44:29,600 --> 01:44:33,600
-She's cooking, right?
Collignon, go fetch.

1092
01:45:25,600 --> 01:45:29,600
-Amélie ? Amélie ?

1093
01:45:35,600 --> 01:45:39,600
Amélie ?

1094
01:46:28,600 --> 01:46:32,600
*-Go to the bedroom,
Miss Poulain.

1095
01:46:46,600 --> 01:46:50,600
All right... Amélie, my girl...

1096
01:46:50,600 --> 01:46:54,600
You don't have glass bones like me,
you can knock against life

1097
01:46:57,600 --> 01:47:01,600
If you let this opportunity
 slip away,..

1098
01:47:01,600 --> 01:47:04,600
..then, as time goes by...

1099
01:47:04,600 --> 01:47:07,600
..it's your heart that will become...

1100
01:47:07,600 --> 01:47:10,600
..as dry and fragile..

1101
01:47:10,600 --> 01:47:13,600
..as my bones

1102
01:47:13,600 --> 01:47:16,600
So...

1103
01:47:16,600 --> 01:47:20,600
Go for it!
For Christ's sake!

1104
01:47:34,600 --> 01:47:38,600
-I...

1105
01:49:19,600 --> 01:49:23,600
-Hey !

1106
01:50:59,600 --> 01:51:01,600
-To the International Airport

1107
01:51:01,600 --> 01:51:05,600
-Today's September 28, 1997,
it's 11 o'clock in the morning

1108
01:51:06,600 --> 01:51:08,600
At the Trône Fair

1109
01:51:08,600 --> 01:51:12,600
..the marshmallow-mixing machine
mixes marshmallow.

1110
01:51:12,600 --> 01:51:15,600
At the same moment, at the La Villette
garden Félix L'Herbier discovers...

1111
01:51:15,600 --> 01:51:17,600
..that the number of possible connexions
in a human brain..

1112
01:51:17,600 --> 01:51:21,600
..is superior to the number of atomes
in the universe. Meanwhile,..

1113
01:51:21,600 --> 01:51:25,600
..at the foot of the Sacré-Coeur, the
Benedictines work on their backhand.

1114
01:51:25,600 --> 01:51:29,600
The temperature is 24° C,
the moisture content is 70°..

1115
01:51:29,600 --> 01:51:33,600
..and the atmospheric pressure
990 millibar.
