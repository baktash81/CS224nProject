GARY [ON SPEAKER]:
A question to you, Frederick, sir.

335
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:53,566
How much would you be willing to spend
for a weekend of erotic pleasures...

336
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,963
-...with one of the most beautiful women?
FRED [ON SPEAKER]: Six grand.

337
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:00,323
I've gotta have a way to get
the money out of the checking account.

-I assume the genie could help with that?
-Oh. I got you.

-I'll just give you my routing number?
-Ha, ha.

-Ahh, I don't know.
-Come on. You've gotta have a number.

-I don't know.

You mean rather than take
the slow boat to resentment?

I'm just saying, maybe a little freedom
would be good for them, and for you.

380
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,287
Have you ever considered giving
him a hall pass?

00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,245
-A what?
-A hall pass. A week off from marriage.

I'm saying, give them a week off
from marriage.

385
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:02,284
Look, most married men have very
foggy memories of their single days...

386

...and they begin to believe
that if not for you...

387

...they could be with these other women.

00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,641
That's Fred.

389
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,531
I mean, he thinks
because he sees big tits all day long...

390
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,365
...and he manages to make it home
without squeezing one...

391
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,330
...that I should be greeting him
at the door like some hero.

392
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,802
Maybe it's time to let them
go out there and find out what it's like.

393
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,406
-Huh?
LUCY: it's called the reactance theory.

394
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,967
It's a principle in psychology
which says...

395
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:29,283
...that if you constantly tell someone
they can't do something...

396
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,369
...they just want to do it
more than ever.

397
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,490
Conversely, if you remove the taboo,
you remove the obsession.

Are you telling us you let Charlie
sleep with another woman?

the freedom to choose for himself.
