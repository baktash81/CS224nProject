1
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,400
YOUR NAME
IS MERLIN JONES,

2
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,400
AND YOU'RE A STUDENT
AT MIDVALE COLLEGE.

3
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,800
YES, YOUR HONOR.

4
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,800
MR. JONES, YOU REALIZE

5
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,400
THIS IS A MOST UNUSUAL
ADOPTION PETITION.

6
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,400
YES, YOUR HONOR, I DO.

7
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,600
IN THE FIRST PLACE,
YOU DON'T HAVE

8
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,400
THE WRITTEN CONSENT
OF THE NATURAL PARENTS.

9
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,800
WELL, I-I CAN'T GET
THAT, SIR.

10
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,600
ARE THEY ALIVE?

11
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,800
THEY MAY BE. IF THEY ARE,
THEY'RE SOMEWHERE IN AFRICA.

12
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,400
AND IN THE SECOND PLACE,

13
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,200
WELL, YOU, THE ADOPTING PARENT,

14
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,400
A-ARE AN UNMARRIED MALE.

15
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,800
THAT'S CORRECT, SIR.

16
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,600
AND IN THE THIRD PLACE,

17
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,200
THERE'S, UH, NO PRECEDENT
FOR ADOPTING A CHIMPANZEE.

18
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,000
I KNOW THAT,
YOUR HONOR.

19
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,600
TELL ME, WHY ARE YOU SO ANXIOUS
TO ADOPT THIS CHIMPANZEE?

20
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,000
TO GIVE HIM THE ADVANTAGES
OF A GOOD HOME.

21
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,400
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE
TO ADOPT HIM

22
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,200
TO GIVE HIM A NICE CLEAN CAGE

23
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,600
AND A BUNCH OF BANANAS.

24
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,800
YOUR HONOR, I WANT STANLEY
TO HAVE MORE THAN THAT.

25
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,600
I WANT HIM TO HAVE
A STIMULATING ENVIRONMENT.

26
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,600
I WANT HIM TO HAVE A CHANCE

27
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,800
TO REALIZE HIS FULL
INTELLECTUAL POSSIBILITIES.

28
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,400
YES, I REMEMBER.

29
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,200
YOU BELIEVE THAT CHIMPS

30
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,000
CAN BE TRAINED TO THINK
LIKE HUMANS.

31
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
YES, SIR.

32
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,200
I BELIEVE THAT STANLEY
CAN BE TAUGHT TO WORK AND THINK

33
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,600
ON A COLLEGE-STUDENT LEVEL.

34
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,200
WELL, THAT
SEEMS REASONABLE.

35
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,400
I KNOW COLLEGE STUDENTS

36
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,400
WHO WORK AND THINK
ON A CHIMPANZEE LEVEL.

37
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,800
YES, SIR.

38
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,600
AND IF STANLEY HAD LEGAL
STATUS, HE'D BE PROTECTED.

39
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,600
PEOPLE COULDN'T BE COMPLAINING
OR PHONING THE POLICE

40
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,400
ABOUT HIM LIVING IN THE HOUSE
AND THINGS LIKE THAT.

41
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,200
WILL THE YOUNG LADY
WHO TESTIFIED

42
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,200
AS A CHARACTER WITNESS
FOR MR. JONES

43
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,800
PLEASE COME FORWARD?

44
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,800
YOU TESTIFIED THAT MERLIN JONES
IS OF GOOD CHARACTER

45
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,800
AND IS A SOBER
AND INDUSTRIOUS CITIZEN.

46
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,800
YES, SIR, HE IS.

47
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
DO YOU BELIEVE

48
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,400
THAT HE WILL GIVE STANLEY
EVERY CARE AND AFFECTION?

49
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,600
OH, MERLIN
IS VERY AFFECTIONATE.

50
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,400
I MEAN,
HE'S VERY RESPONSIBLE,

51
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,400
AND I'M SURE HE'LL SEE

52
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,600
THAT STANLEY GETS
LOTS OF CARE AND AFFECTION.

53
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,400
THANK YOU.

54
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,400
MR. JONES...

55
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,400
AFTER DUE CONSIDERATION
OF THIS MATTER,

56
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,400
I HAVE REACHED MY DECISION.

57
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,600
UH, THE PETITION
FOR FORMAL ADOPTION AS PRESENTED

58
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,600
IS HEREWITH DENIED.

59
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,400
HOWEVER, IT IS NOT NOW,
NOR EVER,

60
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,600
THE INTENTION OF THIS COURT

61
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,800
TO STIFLE THE ACADEMIC FREEDOM
OF THIS COMMUNITY.

62
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,000
MR. JONES, TO PROVIDE YOU
WITH THE PROPER STATUS

63
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,600
WITHIN WHICH
STANLEY'S MENTAL CAPACITIES

64
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,400
MAY BE BROUGHT
TO FULL FLOWER,

65
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,800
I AM PERSUADED
THAT SOME FORM

66
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,800
OF CONDITIONAL GUARDIANSHIP
MAY BE IN ORDER.

67
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,800
SO, HENCEFORTH,
YOU WILL BE REGARDED

68
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,000
IN THE EYES OF THIS COURT

69
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
AND ARE SO APPOINTED
AS THE MONKEY'S UNCLE.

70
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,600
OH, THANK YOU, SIR!

71
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,400
BUT HE'S NOT A MONKEY, SIR.
HE'S A CHIMP.

72
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,600
OH, YES, YES,
OF COURSE, A CHIMP.

73
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,600
ORDER!
ORDER IN THE COURT!

74
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,400
BAILIFF,
NEXT PETITION, PLEASE.

75
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,400
OH, STANLEY.
YOU'RE CIVILIZED NOW, STANLEY,

76
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,400
WHICH MEANS
THAT THERE'S MORE TO LIFE

77
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,000
THAN JUST EATING AND SLEEPING
AND WATCHING WESTERNS.

78
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,400
THERE, THAT'S BEETHOVEN'S
FIFTH SYMPHONY.

79
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,400
IT'S A LOT BETTER THAN COWBOYS
AND INDIANS, ISN'T IT?

80
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,200
NO, STANLEY,

81
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,800
THE IDEA IS TO EXPOSE YOU
TO INTELLECTUAL INFLUENCES.

82
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,800
THAT'S BETTER, ISN'T IT?

83
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,400
YOU TIRED, SON?

84
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,800
OF COURSE YOU ARE.
IT'S LATE.

85
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
COME ON, STANLEY,
IT'S BEDTIME.

86
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,400
THERE YOU GO.

87
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,000
IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY
FOR YOU, HASN'T IT?

88
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,400
NO, STANLEY,
YOU'RE FORGETTING SOMETHING.

89
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,600
WE BRUSH OUR TEETH
BEFORE WE GO TO BED.

90
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,800
THAT'S A GOOD BOY,
STANLEY.

91
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,600
ALL RIGHT, STANLEY.

92
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,600
NOW, YOU SEE,
THIS IS YOUR TOOTHBRUSH.

93
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,800
THE OTHER ONE'S MINE.

94
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,400
FIRST THING WE DO IS SQUEEZE OUT
THE TOOTHPASTE ON THE BRUSH,

95
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,600
LIKE THIS.

96
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,600
AND THEN
WE BRUSH OUR TEETH.

97
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,200
NOW, OPEN YOUR MOUTH.

98
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,800
OPEN YOUR MOUTH.

99
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,600
THAT'S GOOD.
NOW, WE BRUSH UP AND DOWN.

100
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,400
UP AND DOWN,
YOU SEE?

101
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,000
THAT'S A GOOD BOY.

102
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
THAT'S VERY GOOD, STANLEY,
UP AND DOWN.

103
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,800
THERE'S SOMEONE AT THE DOOR.
YOU KEEP BRUSHING YOUR TEETH.

104
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,400
JENNIFER.

105
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,800
WHY DO YOU LOOK
SO SURPRISED?

106
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,600
YOU'RE TAKING ME
TO A MOVIE, REMEMBER?

107
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,400
BUT I-I MADE THAT DATE
BEFORE I BECAME STANLEY'S UNCLE.

108
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,000
WELL, THAT DOESN'T MEAN
WE CAN'T GO OUT ANYMORE.

109
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,600
BUT, JENNIFER, YOU HEARD
WHAT JUDGE HOLMSBY SAID.

110
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,400
I HAVE TO GIVE STANLEY
CARE AND AFFECTION.

111
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,800
THE MOST DEVOTED PARENTS
IN THE WORLD

112
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,800
GET BABYSITTERS
AND GO OUT OCCASIONALLY.

113
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,400
LEAVE STANLEY WITH A SITTER?
I COULDN'T DO THAT.

114
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,400
THERE'S LOTS OF GIRLS AT SCHOOL
WHO DO SITTING,

115
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,800
AND THEY'RE
VERY COMPETENT.

116
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT I'LL DO.

117
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I'LL PUT STANLEY TO BED,

118
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,600
AND THEN WE CAN GO OUT
IN THE YARD AND TALK.

119
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,200
MERLIN, STOP FUSSING.

120
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,600
YOU TAKE A BEAST FRESH OUT
OF THE JUNGLE, AND YOU--

121
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,000
JEN.
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

122
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,600
PLEASE DON'T EVER USE
THAT WORD AROUND STANLEY.

123
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,000
WHAT WORD, JUNGLE?

124
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,200
HE MIGHT HEAR YOU.

125
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,000
MERLIN, YOU'RE BEING
ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS

126
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,200
ABOUT THAT CHIMP.

127
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,600
RIDICULOUS, AM I?

128
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,600
JUST LET ME SHOW YOU
THE PROGRESS HE'S MADE.

129
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,000
PROGRESS?

130
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,000
WELL, NOW, HERE'S
A NICE GLASS OF WATER

131
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,200
IN CASE YOU GET THIRSTY.

132
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,600
AND IN CASE
YOU GET HUNGRY--

133
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,800
MERLIN,
YOU'RE SPOILING HIM.

134
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:45,800
JEN, PLEASE, LET'S NOT QUARREL
IN FRONT OF HIM.

135
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:49,600
UNCLE MERLIN IS TREATING STANLEY
LIKE A LITTLE BABY, ISN'T HE?

136
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,600
BUT STANLEY'S REALLY
A BIG, GROWN-UP BOY.

137
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,200
PUT THESE
ON HIS HEAD.

138
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,600
ONE HERE AND ONE HERE
AND ONE HERE.

139
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,200
CURLERS?

140
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,000
STANLEY,
ISN'T THIS EXCITING?

141
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,600
TOMORROW MORNING
WHEN YOU WAKE UP,

142
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,600
YOU'LL BE THE ONLY
CURLY-TOP CHIMP IN THE WORLD.

143
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,000
THAT'S NOT
THE IDEA AT ALL.

144
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,600
I'M PREPARING HIM
FOR A LITTLE SLEEP LEARNING.

145
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,200
SLEEP LEARNING?

146
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,800
YOU MEAN WHERE THEY PUT WHAT YOU
HAVE TO LEARN ON A RECORD,

147
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,200
AND YOU LET IT PLAY ALL NIGHT
WHILE YOU'RE ASLEEP,

148
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,600
AND THE NEXT MORNING
YOU KNOW IT?

149
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,000
THAT'S THE OLD SLEEP LEARNING.

150
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I'VE GOT A NEW IDEA.

151
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
YOU SEE, I BYPASS
THE EAR ENTIRELY,

152
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
AND BY BONE CONDUCTION, I PIPE
IT THROUGH THE LEARNING CENTERS

153
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,400
IN THE TEMPORAL LOBES
AND THE PRECENTRAL GYRUS

154
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,000
DIRECT INTO HIS UNCONSCIOUS.

155
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,200
ISN'T THAT WONDERFUL,
STANLEY?

156
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,000
I'VE RECORDED THESE RECORDS
FOR HIM TO LEARN.

157
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,400
12 EASY LESSONS
IN CIVILIZATION.

158
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,000
HE'LL HAVE A LOT
OF STUDYING TO DO.

159
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,800
THIS TIMER WILL START THE RECORD
AS SOON AS HE'S ASLEEP.

160
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:39,600
THEN HE'LL BEGIN TO LEARN
THE MANY SIMPLE LITTLE THINGS

161
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,200
THAT ADD UP
TO BEING CIVILIZED.

162
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,200
THINGS YOU AND I DO
WITHOUT EVEN THINKING OF THEM.

163
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,000
GOOD NIGHT, STANLEY.

164
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
GOOD NIGHT.

165
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
AND GOOD LUCK.

166
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,400
WHEN THE ALARM CLOCK RINGS,
TURN IT OFF,

167
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,800
GET OUT OF BED,

168
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,200
TURN ON THE COFFEE,

169
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,200
PUT OUT THE CAT,

170
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:28,400
TAKE A SHOWER
AND BRUSH YOUR TEETH.

171
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,000
NOW WAKE ME UP.

172
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,200
WHEN THE ALARM CLOCK RINGS,
TURN IT OFF.

173
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,800
GET OUT OF BED.

174
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,400
TURN ON THE COFFEE.

175
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,200
PUT OUT THE CAT.

176
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,200
TAKE A SHOWER
AND BRUSH YOUR TEETH.

177
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,800
NOW WAKE ME UP.

178
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,000
WAKE ME UP.

179
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
WAKE ME UP.

180
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,800
WAKE ME UP.

181
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,000
YOU DID IT, STANLEY.
YOU DID IT.

182
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,000
YOU CARRIED OUT
YOUR ASSIGNMENTS.

183
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,200
GOOD BOY!

184
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,200
YOU'LL BE THE SMARTEST CHIMP
IN MIDVALE, HUH?

185
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,000
AREN'T YOU, STANLEY?
SMARTEST CHIMP IN MIDVALE.

186
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,200
SORRY, I'M LATE,
GENTLEMEN.

187
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,400
THAT'S QUITE
ALL RIGHT, JUDGE.

188
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,200
MR. DEARBORNE
HAS BEEN TELLING US ONCE AGAIN

189
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,800
ABOUT OUR
TROUBLESOME PROBLEM--

190
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,800
STUDENTS CHEATING
ON EXAMINATIONS.

191
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,200
PARTICULARLY
FOOTBALL PLAYERS.

192
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:33,200
ALL RIGHT, DEARBORNE, WE KNOW
YOU DON'T APPROVE OF FOOTBALL.

193
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,800
I HAVE, THEREFORE,
ASKED PROFESSOR SHATTUCK

194
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,200
TO GIVE US A REPORT
ON THE SUBJECT.

195
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,400
PROFESSOR SHATTUCK

196
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,000
SPECIALIZES IN CHEATING
ON EXAMINATIONS.

197
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:48,800
I MEAN, PROFESSOR SHATTUCK
IS AN EXPERT

198
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,800
ON THE SUBJECT
OF CHEATING ON EXAMS.

199
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,400
PROFESSOR.

200
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,800
I, UH, WOULD LIKE TO ASSURE
MR. DEARBORNE

201
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,200
THAT EVERY TIME A STUDENT

202
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,800
DEVELOPS
A NEW METHOD OF CHEATING,

203
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,000
A NEW TECHNIQUE OF CRIBBING,

204
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,400
OUR SECURITY CORPS WILL DEVELOP
A NEW DEFENSE AGAINST IT.

205
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,600
WE'VE COME A LONG WAY

206
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,200
SINCE HUGO DRIBBLE WAS EXPELLED
FROM MIDVALE, MR. DEARBORNE.

207
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,200
REMEMBER HUGO?

208
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,400
HE WAS IN OUR CLASS--
A GREAT HALFBACK.

209
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,200
HE WAS GREAT AT STEALING
THE SIGNALS OF THE OTHER TEAM.

210
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,000
DRIBBLE USED THE CLASSIC
AND SOMEWHAT OUTDATED METHOD

211
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
OF WRITING THE INFORMATION
HE NEEDED ON HIS CUFFS.

212
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,200
HE WAS CAUGHT IN THE ACT
BY AN INSTRUCTOR

213
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,000
WHO SNEAKED UP ON HIM
WEARING TENNIS SHOES.

214
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,400
WAS HUGO REELECTED TO THE SENATE
AGAIN THIS YEAR?

215
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,200
YOU KNOW, DEARBORNE,
HE'S PRESIDENTIAL TIMBER.

216
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,000
ELMER TEPPET'S
CONTRIBUTION

217
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,600
WAS A MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH
IN THE FIELD OF CRIBBING.

218
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:42,200
NOW, HERE WE HAVE...

219
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:46,200
A PEN AND INK
MADE OF VEGETABLE COLORING

220
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,200
AND ORDINARY CHEWING GUM.

221
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,800
TEPPET WROTE
THE INFORMATION HE NEEDED

222
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,200
ON THE STICK OF GUM

223
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:57,000
AND PLACED IT ON HIS DESK
DURING THE EXAMS.

224
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
WHEN THE INSTRUCTOR
BECAME SUSPICIOUS

225
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,800
AND APPROACHED
TO INVESTIGATE,

226
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,800
TEPPET MERELY DESTROYED
THE EVIDENCE.

227
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,400
A RESOURCEFUL FELLOW.

228
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:09,000
THEY DON'T MAKE QUARTERBACKS
LIKE HIM ANYMORE.

229
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,600
IT TOOK THREE YEARS
TO CATCH UP WITH ELMER TEPPET,

230
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,000
BUT WE FINALLY DID IT.

231
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,400
HE WAS EXPELLED--

232
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,000
JUST BEFORE THE BIG GAME
WITH RANDALL.

233
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,200
YOU HAVE
A VERY GOOD MEMORY, JUDGE.

234
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,400
WE CERTAINLY MISSED HIM.
LOST 42-0 THAT YEAR.

235
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:24,200
IN CONCLUSION,
GENTLEMEN,

236
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,400
LET ME ASSURE YOU

237
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,400
THAT AS NEW SUPER CRIBS
ARE DEVELOPED,

238
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:32,200
WE WILL CREATE SUPER TECHNIQUES
FOR DETECTING THEM.

239
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,400
THANK YOU.

240
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,200
I PROPOSE

241
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,400
WE ABOLISH FOOTBALL
AT MIDVALE COLLEGE.

242
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,600
OH, NO, NOT THAT AGAIN.

243
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,600
EVERY TIME
WE HAVE A PROBLEM,

244
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,600
YOUR SOLUTION IS TO ABOLISH
THE FOOTBALL TEAM.

245
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,400
FOOTBALL IS THE ROOT
OF ALL COLLEGE EVIL.

246
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,000
OH, YOU ONLY SAY THAT BECAUSE
YOU COULDN'T MAKE THE TEAM

247
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,200
WHEN YOU AND I
WERE STUDENTS HERE.

248
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,600
AND YOU ONLY DEFEND FOOTBALL
BECAUSE YOU WERE ON THE TEAM.

249
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,400
FOOTBALL IS AN IMPORTANT PART
OF COLLEGE LIFE.

250
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,400
NOT ONLY
FOR THE PLAYERS,

251
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,800
BUT FOR THE ENTIRE
STUDENT BODY.

252
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
JUDGE HOLMSBY, ARE YOU IN FAVOR
OF CHEATING ON COLLEGE EXAMS?

253
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,200
NO, OF COURSE NOT,

254
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,200
BUT YOU CAN'T BLAME FOOTBALL
FOR THAT.

255
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,200
GETTING GRADES IS ONLY PART
OF ACQUIRING AN EDUCATION,

256
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,000
UNLESS YOUR IDEA
OF AN EDUCATION

257
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
IS TO TURN OUT
MEMORY MACHINES.

258
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I PREFER THE MEN AND WOMEN
WHO CAN THINK.

259
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,400
I MADE A MOTION TO ABOLISH
FOOTBALL ON THIS CAMPUS.

260
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,600
AND I OPPOSE IT
STRENUOUSLY.

261
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,200
GENTLEMEN!

262
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,000
GENTLEMEN!

263
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,400
LET US NOT LOSE
OUR TEMPERS.

264
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,400
I REALLY DO NOT THINK,
AT THIS STAGE,

265
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,200
IT IS NECESSARY
TO DO ANYTHING

266
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,600
AS DRASTIC
AS ABOLISHING FOOTBALL.

267
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,600
HOWEVER, I PROMISE YOU,
MR. DEARBORNE,

268
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,000
THAT PROFESSOR SHATTUCK

269
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,600
AND HIS SECURITY CORPS

270
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,400
WILL BE
PARTICULARLY VIGILANT

271
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,200
DURING THE COMING
EXAMINATION,

272
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,200
AND ESPECIALLY WATCH
FOR THE FOOTBALL PLAYERS.

273
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,200
GOOD EVENING, JUDGE.
OH, HAYWOOD,
I'M GLAD YOU COULD COME.

274
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,000
WELL, WHAT'S
THE TROUBLE?

275
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,600
A CRISIS, HAYWOOD,
AN ABSOLUTE CRISIS.

276
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,200
OH, JUDGE,
THIS IS NORMAN AND LEON.

277
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,200
UH, JUDGE IS ONE
OF OUR GREATEST MU MU ALUMNI

278
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,600
AND A VERY AVID
FOOTBALL FAN.

279
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,400
YES, I'VE SEEN
YOU FELLAS PLAY, OF COURSE.

280
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,200
I ONLY HOPE THAT I HAVEN'T SEEN
YOU PLAY FOR THE LAST TIME.

281
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,200
THE REGENTS HAVEN'T ABOLISHED
FOOTBALL, HAVE THEY?

282
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,000
NO, THEY DIDN'T GO
QUITE THAT FAR.

283
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
UH, MR. DEARBORNE TRIED,
BUT HE FAILED AGAIN.

284
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,200
EVERY YEAR HE TRIES
TO PENALIZE MIDVALE

285
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,400
FOR NOT LETTING HIM
ON THE TEAM

286
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,600
WHEN HE AND I WERE
UNDERGRADUATES HERE.

287
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,000
GEE, I DIDN'T KNOW MIDVALE
WAS THAT OLD A COLLEGE.

288
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,600
I PLAYED FOOTBALL
FOR MIDVALE.

289
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,600
I DIDN'T KNOW FOOTBALL
WAS THAT OLD A GAME.

290
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,200
JUDGE, THE BOYS
ARE A LITTLE CONFUSSED.

291
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,000
ACTUALLY, THE MU MUS
STILL TALK ABOUT THE DAYS

292
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,200
WHEN YOU PLAYED FOOTBALL
FOR MIDVALE.

293
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,200
THEY DO?

294
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,400
THE JUDGE'S NAME
IS HOLMSBY.

295
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,000
THEY CALLED ME
"HURRY UP" HOLMSBY.

296
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,400
YES, SIR,
EVERY TIME TALK

297
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,600
TURNS TO FOOTBALL,

298
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,400
THERE ARE FEW GREAT NAMES
THAT COME UP AGAIN AND AGAIN--

299
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,400
KNUTE ROCKNE,

300
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,200
JIM THORPE,

301
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,200
RED GRANGE,
"HURRY UP" HOLMSBY.

302
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,600
WELL, THAT'S FINE.

303
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,200
THAT'S FINE, HAYWOOD.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

304
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,200
BUT I THINK WE'D BETTER GET
DOWN TO OUR PROBLEM.

305
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,400
THE BOARD HAS DECIDED
TO CRACK DOWN ON EXAM CHEATING

306
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,600
AND TO KEEP A SPECIAL EYE

307
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,600
ON FOOTBALL PLAYERS
DURING THE EXAMS.

308
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,800
WELL, THAT MEANS
THEY ARE ABOLISHING FOOTBALL.

309
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,200
NO, IT JUST MEANS

310
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,000
THAT THE FOOTBALL PLAYERS
WILL HAVE TO PASS

311
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,400
THEIR EXAMS HONESTLY
TO STAY ELIGIBLE.

312
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,200
THEY'RE ABOLISHING
FOOTBALL, JUDGE.

313
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,600
DO YOU MEAN TO TELL ME THAT
THERE ARE NO FOOTBALL PLAYERS

314
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,600
WHO CAN PASS
THEIR EXAMS HONESTLY?

315
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,000
NO, NO, JUDGE, MOST OF THEM
HAVE NO TROUBLE AT ALL.

316
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,800
BUT WHAT MAKES
THE MIDVALE TEAM?

317
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,200
THIS COMBO.

318
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,200
AND WITHOUT THEM,
THE TEAM'S WASHED UP.

319
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,400
WELL, THEY'LL JUST HAVE
TO STUDY HARDER.

320
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,200
THAT'S EASIER SAID
THAN DONE, JUDGE.

321
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,200
YEAH, I SEE
WHAT YOU MEAN.

322
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,200
WELL, THEN WE'LL JUST HAVE
TO FIND A WAY TO CHEAT HONESTLY.

323
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,400
AN HONEST WAY TO CHEAT--
IS THERE SUCH A THING?

324
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,200
I DON'T KNOW,
BUT WE MUST FIND OUT.

325
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,600
WE HAVE A VERY INGENIOUS
YOUNG MAN HERE AT MIDVALE.

326
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,200
AND IF APPROACHED
PROPERLY,

327
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,600
HE MAY PUT HIS INGENUITY
TO WORK FOR US.

328
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,800
JUDGE, THAT'S GREAT.
WHO IS HE?
MERLIN JONES.

329
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,800
MERLIN JONES!

330
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,400
MERLIN JONES.

331
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,200
I HAVE TO LOOK
FOR SOMETHING IN MY PURSE.

332
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,600
I CAN'T STAND HIM.

333
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,600
WHO?
DON HAYWOOD.

334
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,800
HE'S SUCH
A TERRIBLE SNOB.

335
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,600
UNLESS YOU'RE A MEMBER
OF MU MU FRATERNITY

336
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,600
OR SOMETHING ELSE
HE CONSIDERS SOCIALLY IMPORTANT,

337
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,200
HE IGNORES YOU.

338
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,800
HAS HE EVER
SAID HELLO TO YOU?

339
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,200
NEVER.

340
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,800
HELLO, JENNIFER,
HOW ARE YOU?

341
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,800
HI.

342
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,200
MERLIN, OLD MAN,
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

343
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,400
WE'RE HAVING A DANCE AT
THE MU MU HOUSE SATURDAY NIGHT.

344
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,400
WE'D LIKE YOU
TO BE THERE.

345
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,200
ISN'T HE NICE?!

346
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,000
THAT SNOB?

347
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,600
WELL, A PERSON
CAN BE DISCRIMINATING

348
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,800
WITHOUT BEING A SNOB.

349
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,200
AND I HEAR THOSE MU MU DANCES
ARE REALLY MARVELOUS.

350
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,600
WELL, MAYBE SO,
BUT I DON'T INTEND TO FIND OUT.

351
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,400
MERLIN, YOU MUST GO.

352
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,400
WHY MUST I?
IT'D BE RUDE
IF YOU DIDN'T.

353
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,400
I CAN'T LEAVE STANLEY
HOME ALONE AT NIGHT

354
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,600
TO GO TO A MU MU DANCE.

355
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,600
STANLEY--IS THAT WHY
YOU DON'T WANT TO GO?

356
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,200
WELL, AFTER ALL,
HE'S ONLY A--

357
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,200
THERE'S A SITTER-SERVICE NUMBER
ON THE BULLETIN BOARD.

358
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,400
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS CALL,
AND THEY SEND

359
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,400
A VERY CAPABLE SITTER.

360
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,800
I'M SORRY, JEN, BUT I CAN'T FACE
THE IDEA OF GOING OFF

361
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,800
AND LEAVING STANLEY ALONE
WITH A SITTER.

362
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,800
NOW, TRY AND UNDERSTAND.

363
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,600
OH, I DO.

364
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,200
I REALIZE STANLEY
IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN I AM.

365
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,600
OH, JE--
WAIT, JEN, DON'T SAY THAT.

366
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,800
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.

367
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,000
I'VE ALWAYS DREAMED
OF GOING

368
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,600
TO ONE OF THOSE GLAMOROUS,
MARVELOUS MU MU DANCES,

369
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,800
BUT LOTS OF DREAMS
DON'T COME TRUE.

370
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,800
A-ALL RIGHT,
MAYBE WE CAN GO,

371
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,600
B-BUT WE WON'T STAY
TOO LATE.

372
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,400
OH, MERLIN, I'M SO GLAD
YOU DECIDED TO GO.

373
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,200
AND I'VE GOT A NEW DRESS,
AND I KNOW YOU'LL LOVE IT.

374
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,800
WELL, O-OKAY,
BUT--BUT WE WON'T STAY--

375
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,200
AND I'LL TAKE CARE OF ORDERING
THE SITTER FOR YOU.

376
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,800
WELL, JUST TELL HER
IT'S JUST GONNA BE FOR LIKE--

377
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,800
MERLIN.

378
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,200
I FORGOT
WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR.

379
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,800
STANLEY,
I'M PROUD OF YOU.

380
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,400
YOU'VE MADE
TREMENDOUS PROGRESS

381
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,400
IN A VERY SHORT TIME.

382
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,600
BUT THE MAIN THING
IS YOUR CONCENTRATED STUDYING.

383
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,800
VERY GOOD, STANLEY.
VERY GOOD, INDEED.

384
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,800
YOU KNOW, STANLEY--

385
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:56,800
STANLEY, YOUR EYES LOOK
A LITTLE BLOODSHOT.

386
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,800
MAYBE YOU'VE BEEN STUDYING
TOO HARD.

387
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,800
HI, MERLIN.
DO YOU, UH, NOTICE ANYTHING?

388
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,600
YEAH, STANLEY'S EYES
ARE A LITTLE BLOODSHOT.

389
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,800
NOT STANLEY, ME.

390
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,800
YOUR EYES DON'T LOOK
BLOODSHOT AT ALL.

391
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,000
MERLIN,
YOU'RE HOPELESS.

392
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,800
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET YOU
TO NOTICE MY NEW DRESS.

393
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,000
OH, OH, WELL...

394
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,800
IT LOOKS
VERY COMFORTABLE.

395
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:23,600
OH, FORGET IT.
LET'S JUST GOT TO THE DANCE.

396
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,800
THE SITTER
ISN'T HERE YET.

397
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,400
I'M GETTING PRETTY NERVOUS
ABOUT TRUSTING HER WITH STANLEY.

398
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,400
SHE'S OBVIOUSLY UNRELIABLE,

399
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,600
OR SHE WOULD'VE BEEN
HERE ALREADY.

400
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,400
SHE WASN'T SUPPOSED TO BE HERE
UNTIL 8:30.

401
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,800
WELL, IT'S EXACTLY 8:30
AND TEN SECONDS,

402
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,400
AND IF SHE WERE RELIABLE--

403
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,000
HELLO, I'M LISA.

404
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,200
THIS IS MERLIN JONES,

405
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,400
AND I'M JENNIFER.

406
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,600
HELLO, JENNIFER.

407
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,200
I'M SORRY
I'M A LITTLE LATE.

408
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,800
OH, YOU'RE NOT LATE.
YOU'RE JUST IN TIME.

409
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,400
IN FACT,
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY PERFECT.

410
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,400
I WONDER IF IT'S FAIR

411
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,000
FOR LISA TO HAVE TO SIT
WITH STANLEY.

412
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
AFTER ALL, SHE IS A BABYSITTER.
STANLEY'S A CHIMP.

413
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,800
IT WAS YOUR IDEA
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

414
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:18,000
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.
I LOVE ANIMALS.

415
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,600
I'M SURE STANLEY
WILL LOVE YOU, TOO.

416
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,800
OH, HE'S ADORABLE.
AREN'T YOU, STANLEY?

417
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,800
WELL, STANLEY,
WHAT SHALL WE DO?

418
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,600
WOULD YOU LIKE ME
TO SING YOU TO SLEEP?

419
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,800
WHO WOULDN'T?

420
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,800
WHEN YOU'RE READY
FOR NIGHTY-NIGHT,

421
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,800
I'LL SING TO YOU
UNTIL YOU FALL ASLEEP.

422
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,800
SOUNDS WONDERFUL.

423
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,600
I THINK WE SHOULD GO
TO THE DANCE RIGHT NOW.

424
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,000
I'VE TYPED OUT
A FEW INSTRUCTIONS

425
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,600
ABOUT STANLEY'S FOOD
AND EVERYTHING.

426
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,800
THEY'RE IN THE KITCHEN.

427
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,400
I'M SURE LISA
CAN FIND THEM.

428
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,200
GOOD NIGHT, LISA.

429
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,600
GOOD NIGHT, STANLEY.
GOOD NIGHT, LISA.

430
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,800
HAVE A GOOD TIME.

431
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,400
WELL, NOW, STANLEY, WHAT BEDTIME
STORY WOULD YOU LIKE TO HEAR?

432
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,800
IF HIS EYES
LOOK A LITTLE BLOODSHOT,

433
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,600
IT'S ONLY BECAUSE
HE'S BEEN STUDYING--

434
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,000
YOU CAN REACH ME
AT THE MU MU HOUSE,

435
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,400
AND DON'T HESITATE TO CALL--

436
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
MERLIN, THIS DANCE IS LIKE
A DREAM COME TRUE FOR ME.

437
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,800
THE MU MUS
REALLY DO THINGS RIGHT.

438
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,600
THEY SURE SPEND MONEY,
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN.

439
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,800
OH, IT'S MORE THAN THAT.
THEY KNOW HOW TO SPEND IT.

440
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,400
AND THEY TREAT US
LIKE ROYALTY.

441
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,800
I WONDER
WHAT THEIR MOTIVE IS.

442
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,800
MERLIN,
THAT'S UNFAIR.

443
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,600
MAYBE.

444
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,400
GOOD TO SEE YOU HERE,
JENNIFER.
THANK YOU.

445
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,600
SANDWICH?
NO, THANKS.

446
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,600
YOU TOO, MERLIN.

447
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,800
YOU KNOW, YOU FIT HERE,
LIKE THE PAPER ON THE WALL.

448
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,400
SANDWICH?
THANKS.

449
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,600
GEE, I LIKE
YOUR DRESS.
WELL, THANK YOU.

450
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,600
YOU KNOW, JONES, WE REALLY DO
ADMIRE YOUR TASTE IN WOMEN.

451
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,000
HAVE ANOTHER SANDWICH.

452
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
THANK YOU.
THEY SURE ARE GOOD.

453
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,400
TELL ME, DID, UH, ANYONE
EVER TELL YOU

454
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,600
THAT YOU WERE,
UH, MU MU MATERIAL?

455
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,400
NO ONE.

456
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,600
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
IT'S SO OBVIOUS.

457
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,800
WE ALL FEEL THE SAME WAY.

458
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,800
THAT'S WHY
WE'VE INVITED YOU HERE.

459
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,200
THE MU MUS ARE EXCEEDINGLY
INTERESTED IN MERLIN JONES.

460
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,000
MERLIN,
THAT'S WONDERFUL.

461
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
LET'S GO
IN THE TROPHY ROOM.

462
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,400
IT'S MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE
THERE, AND WE CAN TALK.

463
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,000
EXCUSE US?
OF COURSE.

464
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
MAYBE WHILE THEY'RE
IN THERE TALKING BUSINESS,

465
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,800
I COULD TALK YOU
INTO A DANCE.

466
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,800
I'D LOVE TO.
GOOD.

467
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,600
SIT DOWN, MERLIN.
SIT DOWN.

468
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,400
WELL, THANK YOU.

469
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,200
NOW, THE REASON THAT WE'RE
INTERESTED IN YOU, MERLIN,

470
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,600
IS BECAUSE WE HAVE ALWAYS HAD
THE CREAM OF THE CAMPUS--

471
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,600
THE BEST ATHLETES,
THE BEST DANCERS,

472
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,400
THE MOST SKILLED POLITICIANS,
THE MOST POPULAR MEN IN COLLEGE.

473
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,200
WELL, WHERE DO I FIT IN?

474
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,200
WE'D LIKE TO HAVE
THE BEST IN EVERYTHING,

475
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,400
INCLUDING SCHOLARSHIP.

476
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,000
WE'VE ALWAYS HAD
EIGHT OR TEN ATHLETES,

477
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,200
HALF A DOZEN POLITICIANS,

478
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,600
THREE OR FOUR
OF EACH OF THE OTHERS,

479
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,400
AND ONE STUDENT.
ONLY ONE?

480
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,600
WE FIGURED

481
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,200
ONE BRAIN IN THE CHAPTER
WAS ENOUGH.

482
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,000
WELL, IN A WAY, IT MAKES IT
EVEN MORE OF AN HONOR

483
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
THAT WE'VE ASKED YOU TO BE
THE ONE BRAIN OF THE MU MUS.

484
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
YES, I GUESS
IT IS AN HONOR.

485
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,800
OF COURSE, THERE'S
A LITTLE RESPONSIBILITY

486
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,800
THAT GOES ALONG
WITH IT.

487
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,200
WE'LL EXPECT YOU TO HELP
OUR KEY FOOTBALL PLAYERS

488
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,000
PASS THEIR EXAMS, SO THEY'LL
STAY ELIGIBLE FOR THE TEAM.

489
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,200
SURE, I'LL BE HAPPY TO HELP THEM
STUDY ANYTIME THEY WISH.

490
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,400
I...

491
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,400
I DON'T THINK YOU DIG
WHAT I'M SAYING.

492
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,800
IT'S NORMAN AND LEON--

493
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
THEY'RE NOT EXACTLY
THE STUDIOUS TYPES.

494
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,800
WHA--WHAT DO YOU
EXPECT ME TO DO?

495
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,200
IT WAS
JUDGE HOLMSBY'S IDEA.

496
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,600
HE TOLD US THAT YOU WERE
SORT OF, UH, INGENIOUS

497
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,000
AND THAT YOU COULD, UH...

498
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
WELL, UH,
FIX THINGS UP FOR THEM.

499
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
IF YOU MEAN CRIBBING,
NOW, THAT'S OUT,

500
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,600
BECAUSE CHEATING ON EXAMS IS
JUST AS DISHONEST AS STEALING.

501
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,200
NOW, WAIT A MINUTE,
MERLIN.

502
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,000
THE JUDGE SAID
THAT YOU WERE SO INGENIOUS

503
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,800
THAT YOU COULD FIGURE OUT
AN HONEST WAY TO CHEAT.

504
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,600
AN HONEST WAY TO CHEAT?

505
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,600
SURE.
LOOK AT IT THIS WAY.

506
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,800
NO ONE WOULD PUT YOU AND NORMAN
IN THE RING TOGETHER

507
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,000
TO SLUG IT OUT
BECAUSE IT WOULDN'T BE FAIR.

508
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,600
WE COULD TRY IT.

509
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,600
BUT THEY PUT YOU
IN THE SAME CLASSROOM.

510
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,600
THEY GIVE YOU
THE SAME EXAMS.

511
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,600
IS THAT FAIR?

512
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,600
NO, IT ISN'T.

513
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,800
IN THE RING,
NORMAN'S A HEAVYWEIGHT,

514
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,000
AND YOU'RE
A MIDDLEWEIGHT.

515
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,600
IN THE CLASSROOM,
YOU'RE A HEAVYWEIGHT,

516
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,000
AND NORMAN'S A FLYWEIGHT.

517
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:17,600
WHAT WE'RE ASKING YOU TO DO
IS FIGHT INJUSTICE.

518
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,000
LOOK, I'M WILLING
TO HELP ANYONE

519
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,800
WHO WANTS TO STUDY
FOR HIS EXAMS.

520
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:24,000
BUT IF HE CAN'T STUDY
OR IF HE DOESN'T WANT TO STUDY,

521
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,600
THEN WHAT'S HE DOING
IN COLLEGE, ANYWAY?

522
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
HE DOESN'T HAVE A MU MU BONE
IN HIS BODY.

523
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,000
THEY WERE SO NICE TO YOU.

524
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
IT WOULDN'T HAVE HURT YOU
TO HELP THEM.

525
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,600
WELL, I DID OFFER
TO HELP THEM STUDY,

526
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,000
BUT THEY WANTED ME
TO CHEAT FOR THEM.

527
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,600
AND THAT'S AGAINST
YOUR PRINCIPLES, OF COURSE,

528
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,600
SO NOW YOU'RE NOT
GOING TO BE A MU MU.

529
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,000
WELL, DOES IT MEAN
THAT MUCH TO YOU?
YES, IT DOES.

530
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,400
I MEAN, A GIRL LIKES TO GO
TO A DANCE ONCE IN A WHILE,

531
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,400
INSTEAD OF SPENDING
EVERY NIGHT OF HER LIFE

532
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,600
WATCHING
SCIENTIFIC EXPERIMENTS.

533
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,400
AND, ANYWAY, YOU SAID
THEY WANTED YOU TO INVENT

534
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,200
AN HONEST WAY TO CHEAT.

535
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:58,200
HOW COULD I EVER INVENT
A THING LIKE THAT?

536
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,000
MERLIN.

537
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,600
I BELIEVE
YOU CAN DO ANYTHING

538
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,400
IF YOU REALLY
PUT YOUR MIND TO IT.

539
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,200
YOU REALLY THINK
I CAN?

540
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,200
I KNOW YOU CAN.

541
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,400
BUT, JUDGE, IT WILL WORK.
I'M CERTAIN OF IT.

542
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,800
AND IT'S HONEST CHEATING,

543
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,400
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T MATTER
HOW YOU LEARN,

544
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,000
SO LONG
AS YOU DO LEARN.

545
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,600
SLEEP LEARNING?

546
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:31,000
IT'S AN APPLICATION
OF A SOUND SCIENTIFIC CONCEPT.

547
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,400
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT
EITHER.

548
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,000
IT WORKED WONDERS
WITH STANLEY.

549
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,400
YEAH, BUT STANLEY'S
AN INTELLIGENT CHIMP.

550
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,600
THE QUESTION IS,
WILL IT WORK WITH, UH...

551
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,000
THESE TWO.

552
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
IN WORLD WAR II,

553
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,800
THEY USED IT TO TEACH
FOREIGN LANGUAGES

554
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,000
TO MEN WHO HAD TO LEARN THEM
IN A HURRY.

555
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,400
BUT WE DON'T HAVE TO LEARN
A FOREIGN LANGUAGE.

556
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,800
WE HAVE TO LEARN
ENGLISH.

557
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,200
BUT ENGLISH
IS A FOREIGN LANGUAGE.

558
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,000
WELL, ENGLAND'S
A FOREIGN COUNTRY, ISN'T IT?

559
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
YOU HAVE TO LEARN
ENGLISH LITERATURE.

560
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I'M ALL

561
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,600
FOR GOING AHEAD
WITH MERLIN'S IDEA.

562
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,000
IN THE FIRST PLACE,
WE HAVE NO ALTERNATIVE.

563
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,000
AND IN THE SECOND PLACE...

564
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,600
WELL, THERE'S
NOTHING ELSE TO DO.

565
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,200
I HAD JENNIFER RECORD
ALL THE INFORMATION YOU'LL NEED

566
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,800
FOR TOMORROW'S
ENGLISH-LIT CLASS.

567
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,800
I...

568
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,400
I WAS SURE YOU'D PREFER
HER VOICE TO MINE.

569
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,200
WELL, YOU'RE DARN RIGHT
WE WOULD.

570
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:19,000
HEY, MERLIN, WHAT DO WE DO
WHILE THIS IS ALL GOING ON?

571
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,200
YOU JUST SLEEP.
HEY, NO KIDDING.

572
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,400
IF THERE'S ONE THING
I'M GOOD AT, IT'S SLEEPING.

573
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,800
WELL, EVERYTHING'S SET.

574
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,800
GOOD NIGHT, FELLAS.
GOOD NIGHT, MERLIN.

575
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,800
GOOD NIGHT, MERLIN.
GOOD NIGHT.

576
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,000
HEY, MERLIN?
YES, NORM?

577
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,600
YOU SURE YOU EXPLAINED
TO ALL THE GUYS

578
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,200
ABOUT THESE THINGS
ON OUR HEADS?

579
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,400
OH, I'M SURE. THEY ALL KNOW IT'S
PART OF THE FOOTBALL EFFORT.

580
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,200
GOOD. I DON'T WANT
ANY TROUBLE

581
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,200
FROM THE WISE GUYS
AROUND HERE.

582
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,000
OH, SURE, SURE.
GOOD NIGHT.

583
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,400
HEY, MERLIN?

584
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,200
YES, LEON?

585
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,800
YOU THINK WE MIGHT END UP
WITH WAVY HAIR?

586
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,400
GEE, I DON'T KNOW.

587
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,000
GO TO SLEEP, WILL YOU?
GOOD NIGHT.

588
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
GOOD NIGHT, MERLIN.

589
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,200
HEY, MERLIN?

590
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,400
YES, NORM?

591
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,200
I WANT A DRINK
OF WATER.

592
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,800
NO, YOU CAN'T HAVE ONE!
GOOD NIGHT!

593
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,000
THE ELIZABETHAN PERIOD

594
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,400
TAKES ITS NAME
FROM ELIZABETH I,

595
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:25,600
WHO WAS QUEEN OF ENGLAND
FROM 1558 TO 1603.

596
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,400
THE OUTSTANDING LITERARY...

597
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:30,200
FURTHERMORE, GEOFFREY CHAUCER
WAS THE FIRST ENGLISH POET

598
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,200
TO USE
THE IAMBIC PENTAMETER.

599
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:36,000
AND LATER ON, HE DEVELOPED
MANY COMPLICATED STANZA FORMS,

600
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,400
THE MOST FAMOUS OF WHICH
WAS THE SEVEN-LINE STANZA,

601
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,800
OR THE RHYME ROYAL.

602
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:44,200
THANK YOU, MERLIN.
THAT'S QUITE CORRECT.

603
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,200
NORMAN.

604
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,400
YES, SIR.

605
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,000
TELL ME WHAT WE MEAN

606
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
WHEN WE SPEAK
OF THE ELIZABETHAN PERIOD.

607
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,200
THE ELIZABETHAN PERIOD, SIR.

608
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,400
THAT'S RIGHT.

609
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,000
UH, WHAT IS THE SOURCE
OF ITS NAME

610
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,800
AND WHAT PERIOD
IT COVERS.

611
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,200
AND TELL US WHO SOME

612
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,800
OF THE OUTSTANDING LITERARY
FIGURES OF THAT ERA WERE.

613
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,600
THE ELIZABETHAN PERIOD

614
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,000
TAKES ITS NAME
FROM ELIZABETH I,

615
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,600
WHO WAS QUEEN
OF ENGLAND

616
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,200
FROM 1558

617
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,400
TO 1603.

618
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,400
THE OUTSTANDING
LITERARY FIGURE

619
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,400
OF THAT TIME
WAS WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,

620
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,800
WHOSE PLAYS AND SONNETS

621
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:24,000
ARE AMONG THE GREATEST GLORIES
OF ENGLISH LITERATURE.

622
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,400
OTHER WRITERS

623
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,000
WHOSE SOARING IMAGINATION
AND VERBAL FELICITY

624
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,400
ENRICHED THIS PERIOD

625
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,400
ARE BEN JONSON,
CHRISTOPER MARLOWE,

626
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:36,000
EDMUND SPENCER,
FRANCIS BACON,

627
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,200
SIR PHILIP SYDNEY,
BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER,

628
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,200
AND A HOST

629
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,000
OF DISTINGUISHED POETS,
PLAYWRIGHTS--

630
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,200
THAT'S ENOUGH!

631
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,800
BUT, JUDGE, I WASN'T TRYING
TO BE FUNNY OR ANYTHING.

632
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,000
IT JUST CAME OUT
THAT WAY.

633
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,000
MOST UNFORTUNATE.

634
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,200
NOW THE PROFESSOR'S
SO MAD,

635
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,400
THEY'LL HAVE TO GET 90 OR BETTER
ON THE EXAM JUST TO PASS.

636
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,400
90?

637
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:04,000
BUT THE THING IS,
THEY KNEW THE RIGHT ANSWERS.

638
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
DID YOU?

639
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,400
EVERY WORD. IT JUST CAME OUT
IN THE WRONG VOICE.

640
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,800
AND ON THE WRITTEN EXAM,
THERE WON'T BE THAT PROBLEM.

641
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,400
BUT 90%.

642
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,400
BEGIN.

643
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,000
OH, MAN,
WHAT AN EXPERIENCE!

644
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,600
YOU READ THE QUESTION,
AND--AND POW, RIGHT THERE.

645
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,600
THE ANSWER'S
RIGHT THERE IN YOUR HEAD.
OH, THAT'S GREAT!

646
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,000
AND YOU'RE SURE
YOU GOT 90% RIGHT?

647
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,400
OH, I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

648
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,200
THAT'S WHAT YOU NEED
TO PASS THE COURSE

649
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,600
AND STAY ELIGIBLE
FOR FOOTBALL.

650
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,200
WELL, I GOT 100% RIGHT!

651
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,200
100%?
YEAH.

652
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,400
ME TOO!
I KNEW ALL THE ANSWERS!

653
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,600
THAT'S WONDERFUL!
MERLIN!

654
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,600
MERLIN, I WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT WHAT YOU'VE DONE

655
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,600
WILL LIVE
IN MU MU HISTORY FOREVER.

656
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,600
THE WAY I SEE IT,

657
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:31,600
THE REAL FOOTBALL HERO
OF MIDVALE IS MERLIN JONES.

658
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,200
I DON'T MEAN TO KNOCK NORMAN
OR LEON OR ANYONE,

659
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,000
BUT THEY WOULDN'T EVEN BE ABLE
TO PLAY FOOTBALL

660
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,200
IF IT WASN'T FOR MERLIN.

661
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,200
AND I WANT HIM TO KNOW

662
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,600
THAT I'VE HAD CONFIDENCE IN HIM
FROM THE START.

663
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,000
I KNEW HE'D COME THROUGH,
AND HE HAS!

664
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,600
FROM NOW ON,
YOU MUST THINK OF MERLIN

665
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:53,200
AS BELONGING TO MIDVALE
AND NOT JUST TO YOU.

666
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,000
OH, I DON'T
REALLY MIND.

667
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,200
ONLY HE DOESN'T HAVE
TO ENJOY IT SO.

668
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,200
EXCUSE ME.

669
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,600
HELLO?
OH, HI, HENRY.

670
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,000
QUIET, EVERYONE!
QUIET!

671
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,200
THIS IS IT.

672
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,600
THAT'S
THE ENGLISH LIT GRADES.

673
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,400
WE GOT A CONTACT
THAT PHONES US THE RESULTS

674
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,000
AS SOON AS THE PAPERS
ARE MARKED.

675
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
THAT'S GREAT.

676
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:15,200
OKAY, LET'S START
WITH LEON.

677
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,200
LEON, "F."
"F"?!

678
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,600
"F"?!

679
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,400
ARE YOU SURE?

680
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,400
WELL, WHAT ABOUT NORMAN?

681
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,800
NORMAN, "F"?

682
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,200
WHAT?! AN "F"

683
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,400
FOR MERLIN JONES?!

684
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:42,600
NORMAN, MERLIN, AND LEON--
YES, I'LL TELL THEM.

685
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:46,200
WIPE THAT LIPSTICK
OFF YOUR FACE, STUPID.

686
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:49,600
YOU'RE WANTED IN
THE REGENTS' OFFICE IMMEDIATELY.

687
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,600
NOW, PROFESSOR,
WHEN DID YOU FIRST LEARN

688
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,200
OF THE CONSPIRACY TO CHEAT
ON THE ENGLISH LIT EXAM?

689
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,200
JUST A MINUTE--
THAT'S A LEADING QUESTION,

690
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,400
WHICH PRESUMES THE GUILT
OF THE DEFENDANTS.

691
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,600
NOW, THE CORRECT
LEGAL PROCEDURE--

692
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,400
YOU HAVE MADE YOUR OBJECTION,
JUDGE HOLMSBY,

693
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,800
AND YOU DO NOT NEED TO EXPLAIN
LEGAL PROCEDURE TO ME.

694
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,600
OH, I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE AN ATTORNEY.

695
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:15,600
I'M NOT, BUT I WATCH ALL OF
THE LAWYER SHOWS ON TELEVISION.

696
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,200
WELL, I SUPPOSE
THAT'S BETTER

697
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,400
THAN WATCHING
ALL THE DOCTOR SHOWS

698
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,600
AND GOING AROUND
PERFORMING OPERATIONS.

699
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,800
WOULD YOU MIND LETTING
THE WITNESS ANSWER THE QUESTION?

700
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,800
NOT AT ALL.
HMM.

701
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,600
WELL, PROFESSOR?

702
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,800
DURING THE EXAMINATION,

703
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,200
THE INSTRUCTOR BECAME SUSPICIOUS
OF CERTAIN MOVEMENTS

704
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,600
THAT WERE BEING MADE
BY MERLIN JONES.

705
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,600
THE INSTRUCTOR
CONTACTED ME

706
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,400
IN MY PLACE
OF CONCEALMENT,

707
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,800
AND I PHOTOGRAPHED MR. JONES

708
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,800
GIVING SIGNALS
TO OTHER STUDENTS.

709
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,600
ARE THESE
THE PHOTOGRAPHS?

710
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,200
THEY ARE.
EXHIBIT "A."

711
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,600
WAS THERE ANY EVIDENCE TO
CONVINCE YOU OF YOUR SUSPICIONS?

712
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,200
THERE WAS, INDEED.

713
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,600
AND WHAT
WAS THAT EVIDENCE?

714
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,200
WHEN THE INSTRUCTOR
GRADED THE PAPERS,

715
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,600
HE FOUND THAT TWO OTHER STUDENTS
HAD WRITTEN ANSWERS

716
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,400
THAT WERE
WORD-FOR-WORD THE SAME

717
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,400
AS THOSE
OF MERLIN JONES.

718
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,200
"WORD-FOR-WORD

719
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,400
THE SAME AS THOSE
OF MERLIN JONES."

720
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,400
YOUR WITNESS.

721
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,600
NO QUESTIONS
AT THIS TIME.

722
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,400
THANK YOU, PROFESSOR.

723
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,600
I NOW CALL MERLIN JONES.

724
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:38,400
YOU ARE A VERY CLEVER
YOUNG MAN, MR. JONES.

725
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,800
AND I WANT
TO CONGRATULATE YOU

726
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,800
ON THE INGENIOUS CODE
YOU WORKED OUT.

727
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,800
I'D LIKE YOU
TO EXPLAIN IT TO US.

728
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:47,000
NOW, UH, WHAT DOES THIS MEAN--
SCRATCHING YOUR EAR?

729
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,600
IT MEANS MY EAR ITCHED.

730
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,400
YOUR EAR ITCHED?

731
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,600
DOES IT ITCH OFTEN?

732
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:54,400
NO. IT DOESN'T.

733
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:58,800
NOW, WHY SHOULD YOUR EAR
CONVENIENTLY PICK EXAM TIME

734
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,800
TO START ITCHING?

735
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,800
WELL, I SUPPOSE
I COULD'VE BEEN NERVOUS.

736
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,200
THAT MIGHT HAVE CAUSED IT.

737
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,400
NERVOUS.

738
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,600
NOW, WHY SHOULD
A GOOD STUDENT LIKE YOU

739
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,800
BE NERVOUS
OVER AN ENGLISH LIT EXAM?

740
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,400
UNLESS YOU WERE WORRIED
THAT SOMEONE MIGHT CATCH YOU

741
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,600
SIGNALING THE ANSWERS
TO THE OTHER TWO.

742
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:18,000
THAT ISN'T IT AT ALL!
I WAS NERVOUS BECAUSE--

743
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:18,800
NEVER MIND,
MR. JONES.

744
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,400
WE UNDERSTAND.
NO FURTHER QUESTIONS.

745
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,200
JUDGE HOLMSBY?

746
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,800
NO QUESTIONS
AT THIS TIME.

747
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,800
YOU MAY STEP DOWN.

748
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,800
YOU HAVE JUST HEARD
FROM THE MASTERMIND.

749
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,400
WE WILL NOW HEAR

750
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:37,200
FROM LEON AND NORMAN,
HIS PARTNERS IN CRIME.

751
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,600
OH, NO SELF-RESPECTING
TELEVISION ATTORNEY

752
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,200
WOULD LET YOU GET AWAY
WITH THAT ONE.

753
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,600
LOOK AT THEM,
GENTLEMEN.

754
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:47,600
DO THEY LOOK LIKE STUDENTS
WHO WOULD GET GRADES OF 100%

755
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,600
IN ENGLISH LITERATURE?

756
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,400
DO THEY LOOK CAPABLE
OF TURNING IN

757
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,400
PERFECT EXAM PAPERS?

758
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,400
IF THE CHARGE AGAINST THESE MEN
WAS LOOKING STUPID,

759
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,000
I WOULDN'T BE HERE
DEFENDING THEM.

760
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,600
AND IF MIDVALE HAD A REGULATION
AGAINST MEN LOOKING STUPID,

761
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:04,400
WE MIGHT LOSE HALF
THE STUDENT BODY

762
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:08,800
AND AT LEAST ONE MEMBER
OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS AS WELL.

763
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,800
I HAVE TOTALED UP

764
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,000
THE ENTIRE NUMBER OF HOURS
IN THE DAY

765
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,600
WHICH YOU SPEND IN CLASS,

766
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,600
UH, AT FOOTBALL PRACTICE,

767
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,400
ON MEALS,

768
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,000
ON SLEEP--

769
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,600
23 HOURS.

770
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:30,400
THAT LEAVES YOU
ONE WHOLE HOUR TO WASTE.

771
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,800
YEAH, YOU GOT TO DO
A LITTLE GOOFING OFF.

772
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,800
AND WHEN
DO YOU FIND TIME

773
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,600
TO STUDY
YOUR ENGLISH LIT?

774
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,600
WHEN WE'RE ASLEEP.

775
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,600
THIS IS NO TIME
FOR FACETIOUSNESS.

776
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,800
I ASKED
WHEN DO YOU STUDY

777
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,000
FOR YOUR
ENGLISH LIT EXAMS?

778
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,800
HE TOLD YOU--
WHEN WE'RE ASLEEP.

779
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:54,600
YOU STUDY YOUR ENGLISH LIT
WHILE YOU'RE ASLEEP.

780
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,800
THAT'S ALL.

781
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,800
JUST A MINUTE.

782
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,800
UH, I DON'T BELIEVE
MR. DEARBORNE BELIEVES YOU

783
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,600
WHEN YOU SAID YOU STUDIED
FOR YOUR ENGLISH LIT EXAMS

784
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,800
WHILE YOU SLEPT.

785
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,800
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME

786
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,400
JUDGE HOLMSBY AND I
HAVE EVER AGREED ON ANYTHING.

787
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:10,600
WILL YOU EXPLAIN HOW YOU STUDIED
FOR YOUR ENGLISH LIT EXAMS

788
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,600
IN MORE DETAIL, PLEASE?

789
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:15,000
WELL, THERE ARE THESE THINGS
ATTACHED TO OUR HEADS.

790
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
I BELIEVE
THEY'RE CALLED EARS.

791
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,800
NO, THESE THINGS
HAD WIRES CONNECTED TO THEM.

792
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,600
AND MERLIN MADE A RECORD,
AND WHILE WE SLEPT,

793
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,800
THIS RECORD PLAYED
OVER AND OVER AGAIN,

794
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,800
AND WHEN WE WOKE UP,
WELL, WE KNEW IT.

795
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,400
IT'S BECAUSE MERLIN JONES
TAUGHT THEM

796
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,400
BY WAY OF SLEEP LEARNING

797
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,600
THAT ALL THREE
OF THEIR EXAM PAPERS WERE ALIKE.

798
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,000
DO YOU EXPECT US
TO BELIEVE

799
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
A COCK-AND-BULL STORY
LIKE THAT?

800
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,000
MERLIN HAS BEEN EDUCATING
A CHIMPANZEE

801
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,400
THROUGH SLEEP LEARNING.

802
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,400
A CHIMPANZEE.

803
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,000
YES, A CHIMPANZEE.

804
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,400
SO HE DECIDED
TO USE SLEEP LEARNING

805
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:46,600
WHEN THE FOOTBALL PLAYERS
NEEDED AN HONEST WAY TO CHEAT.

806
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,800
CHEAT! THERE, YOU SAID
IT YOURSELF.

807
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,600
SLEEP LEARNING OR NOT,
IT IS CHEATING.

808
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,000
I SAID AN HONEST WAY
TO CHEAT.

809
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,400
THERE IS
NO SUCH THING!

810
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,400
AND I SAY THERE IS!

811
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,600
DOESN'T MATTER HOW YOU LEARN
AS LONG AS YOU LEARN!

812
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:58,800
HOLMSBY, YOU ARE
A PIGHEADED OLD FOOL!

813
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,000
GENTLEMEN,
GENTLEMEN, PLEASE.

814
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,400
GENTLEMEN, I THINK
IT MIGHT BE WISER

815
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,400
IF WE DISMISSED
OUR WITNESSES

816
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:09,000
AND CONTINUED
OUR LITTLE CONVERSATION

817
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,600
IN PRIVATE.

818
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,800
LOOKS BAD, HUH?

819
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,800
WELL, ALL THE SAME,
I-I WANT TO THANK YOU, MERLIN.

820
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,800
THANKS FOR WHAT,
FOR GETTING US EXPELLED?

821
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,400
IF YOU KNOW ANYONE
WHO WANTS TO HIRE A TRUCK DRIVER

822
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,800
WHO KNOWS A LOT
ABOUT ENGLISH LITERATURE,

823
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,600
LET ME KNOW.

824
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,800
THE IMPORTANT THING, MERLIN,
IS YOU TRIED.

825
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,600
IF I HADN'T TRIED,
WE'D ALL STILL BE IN COLLEGE.

826
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,000
WELL, WE'RE NOT
EXPELLED YET.

827
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,800
WELL, THE JUDGE IS STILL
IN THERE FIGHTING FOR US.

828
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,200
WELL, LISTEN, MERLIN,

829
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:47,800
ALL THE BRAINS I EVER KNEW
BEFORE YOU WERE KIND OF SNOBS,

830
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,200
BUT NOT YOU.

831
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,800
W-WELL, YOU'RE JUST LIKE
A REGULAR STUPID FELLA,

832
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:54,200
AND THAT'S WHAT I LIKE
ABOUT YOU.

833
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,000
THANKS, LEON.

834
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,800
WELL, COME ON, LET'S GO
BACK TO THE MU MU HOUSE.

835
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,000
NO, I BETTER GET HOME.
I LEFT STANLEY WITH A SITTER.

836
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,600
AND WHEN WILL THE HEAD
OF THE GREEK DEPARTMENT

837
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,600
BE PAID AS MUCH
AS THE FOOTBALL COACH?

838
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,800
JUST AS SOON
AS YOU SEE 50,000 PEOPLE

839
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,600
CHEERING
A GREEK RECITATION.

840
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,800
A COLLEGE IS SUPPOSED TO BE
A PLACE OF LEARNING.

841
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,400
THE ONLY QUESTION IS WHETHER
TO EXPEL THESE STUDENTS.

842
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,000
IF THEY'RE GUILTY,
I AM, TOO.

843
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
I URGED MERLIN
TO DO WHAT HE DID.

844
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,200
AND IF YOU WERE
A STUDENT,

845
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,800
I WOULD VOTE
TO KICK YOU OUT, TOO.

846
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,000
WELL, IF THEY'RE
KICKED OUT,

847
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
I'M QUITTING
THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

848
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
THAT IS THE BEST ARGUMENT
FOR EXPELLING THEM

849
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,400
THAT I HAVE HEARD YET!

850
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,400
NOW, LISTEN!
NOW, LISTEN!

851
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,600
GENTLEMEN!

852
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:38,800
GENTLEMEN, YOU'VE MADE
YOUR POSITION VERY CLEAR.

853
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,800
WE WILL NOW VOTE...

854
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,200
QUIETLY, CALMLY...

855
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,800
AND WITHOUT PREJUDICE.

856
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,400
DID YOU HAVE A NICE EVENING?

857
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,200
WELL, I FLUNKED ENGLISH LIT.

858
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,800
I'VE BEEN ACCUSED OF CHEATING,
AND I MAY GET EXPELLED

859
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:02,800
FROM COLLEGE.

860
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,800
OUTSIDE OF THAT,
I HAD A VERY NICE EVENING.

861
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:05,600
HOW AWFUL.

862
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,800
THE SLEEP LEARNING IDEA
BOOMERANGED.

863
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,400
BUT IT'S DONE SO MUCH
FOR STANLEY.

864
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,800
I KNOW.

865
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,000
MERLIN, MAY I TRY IT?

866
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
WHAT?

867
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,600
THE SLEEP LEARNING.

868
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,000
OH, I REALLY
DON'T UNDERSTAND IT,

869
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
BUT IT'S
TERRIBLY INTRIGUING.

870
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,600
PLEASE, MERLIN.

871
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,600
AW, ALL RIGHT.

872
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,800
WHEN THE ALARM CLOCK RINGS,
TURN IT OFF.

873
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,200
GET OUT OF BED.

874
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:46,600
TURN ON THE COFFEE.

875
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:52,000
OH, YOU POOR DARLING,
SITTING HERE ALONE

876
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
AT A TIME LIKE THIS!

877
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,200
PUT OUT THE CAT.

878
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:55,600
I CAME OVER
JUST AS SOON AS I HEARD.

879
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,000
I THOUGHT OF YOU LONELY
AND DESPERATE.

880
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
OH, YOU NEEDED ME,
DIDN'T YOU, MERLIN?

881
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,200
THEY CAN'T DO THIS
TO YOU.

882
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,800
TAKE A SHOWER,
BRUSH YOUR TEETH.

883
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,600
OF ALL THE PEOPLE I'VE EVER
KNOWN IN MY ENTIRE LIFE,

884
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:05,800
YOU ARE THE MOST
STRAIGHTFORWARD,

885
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:09,200
ABOVEBOARD,
HIGH-MINDED...

886
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:18,000
TWO-FACED, DOUBLE-DEALING CAT
I'VE EVER KNOWN!

887
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,600
ALL RIGHT, LISA,
WHAT'S GOING ON?

888
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:28,200
OH, HELLO. W-WE WERE
JUST CONDUCTING AN EXPERIMENT.

889
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:30,000
YOU DOUBLE-CROSSING
CHIMPSITTER,

890
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,200
I SHOULD'VE KNOWN
WHAT YOU WERE UP TO!

891
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,200
THE EXPERIMENT'S OVER!

892
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:33,600
JEN, LET ME EXPLAIN.

893
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:34,800
YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

894
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:35,800
IT'S QUITE CLEAR
WHAT'S GOING ON.

895
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:36,800
I RESENT THAT!

896
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,800
OH, YOU DO, DO YOU?!
YES, I DO!

897
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,000
PLEASE, GIRLS!

898
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,600
STOP YOUR YELLING AND SHOUTING.
YOU'LL UPSET STANLEY.

899
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:47,000
SO THAT'S IT?
ALL YOU CARE ABOUT IS STANLEY.

900
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,800
YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE QUITE RIGHT, JENNIFER.

901
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,600
HE HASN'T GIVEN A THOUGHT
TO MY FEELINGS

902
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:51,600
OR YOURS.

903
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,000
THAT'S JUST IT, LISA.

904
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,400
AND AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,
HE CAN TAKE STANLEY,

905
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,800
AND BOTH GO
BACK TO THE JUNGLE!

906
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,200
I'M FOR THAT, TOO!

907
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,800
BUT, JEN!

908
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,800
ISN'T IT RIDICULOUS
THE WAY HE PAMPERS HIM?

909
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,200
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT,
AND I'LL BE GLAD TO TESTIFY

910
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:06,000
THAT HE'S NOT A FIT GUARDIAN
FOR A CHIMPANZEE.

911
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:10,800
STANLEY,
PEOPLE ARE DIFFICULT.

912
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,800
YOU TRY AND DO YOUR BEST
FOR THEM, AND THEN...

913
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,800
SUDDENLY...

914
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,600
OH, NO, STANLEY.
NOT YOU, TOO.

915
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:25,800
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT IT'S LIKE, STANLEY,

916
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,200
TO FEEL THE WHOLE WORLD'S
AGAINST YOU?

917
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:30,600
I TRIED TO HELP
THE FOOTBALL TEAM AND FAILED.

918
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:34,000
NOW EVERYONE
ON CAMPUS HATES ME.

919
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,600
BUT I GUESS
IT DOESN'T MATTER,

920
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,000
BECAUSE I WON'T EVEN BE
ON CAMPUS.

921
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,400
I'M BEING EXPELLED
FROM MIDVALE,

922
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:43,200
KICKED OUT
IN DISGRACE.

923
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,800
AND JENNIFER...

924
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:48,200
SHE'S TURNED
AGAINST ME, TOO.

925
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:52,000
YOU'RE ALL
I HAVE LEFT, STANLEY,

926
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,800
ALL I HAVE LEFT.

927
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,800
HELLO?

928
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:13,000
YES, JUDGE HOLMSBY.

929
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,400
I WOULD LIKE YOU TO COME OVER
TO MY HOUSE RIGHT AWAY.

930
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:18,400
BUT, SIR, I-I DON'T HAVE ANYONE
I CAN LEAVE STANLEY WITH.

931
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,000
WELL, BRING STANLEY
WITH YOU,

932
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:22,000
BUT GET HERE
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

933
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,200
YES, SIR.

934
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:24,800
GOOD-BYE, SIR.

935
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:29,600
WELL, STANLEY, WE MIGHT AS WELL
GET GOING AND FACE THE WORST.

936
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:34,000
GOOD EVENING,
MR. JONES, STANLEY.

937
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,800
GOOD EVENING, SIR.

938
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,200
THE BOARD OF REGENTS
MADE ITS DECISION.

939
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:46,000
IT'S THEIR VERDICT
THAT...

940
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
SURPRISE!

941
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,800
IT'S THEIR VERDICT
THAT SLEEP LEARNING

942
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,400
IS AN HONEST WAY
TO CHEAT,

943
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,400
WITH THE EMPHASIS
ON HONEST.

944
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,000
WE GOT "A"s
IN ENGLISH LIT!

945
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,000
WE CAN PLAY FOOTBALL!

946
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,200
HOORAY FOR MERLIN!

947
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:06,800
JUST CONGRATULATE HIM.
HE'LL UNDERSTAND.

948
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:34,200
WELL, GENTLEMEN,

949
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:37,400
NOW THAT OUR UNHAPPY
LITTLE CONTROVERSY IS OVER,

950
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:39,000
I'M SURE WE'RE ALL AGREED

951
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:43,200
TO CLOSE RANKS AND PROCEED
WITH OUR PROPER TASK--

952
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,400
EDUCATING
THE YOUNG MIND.

953
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:48,000
QUITE RIGHT.
EXACTLY.

954
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
UH, HOWEVER,
THE FIRST BUSINESS AT HAND

955
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,800
IS THIS YEAR'S
FUNDRAISING CAMPAIGN,

956
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:56,400
FOR OUR BELOVED COLLEGE,
ONCE AGAIN, ALAS,

957
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:00,000
IS CHRONICALLY SHORT
OF CASH.

958
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,200
IN CONNECTION WITH THAT,
MR. PRESIDENT,

959
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,800
UH, I HAVE
AN ANNOUNCEMENT TO MAKE,

960
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:05,800
WHICH I THINK WILL MAKE
EVERYONE HERE FEEL VERY HAPPY.

961
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:08,800
I HAVE PERSUADED
MR. J.P. ASTERBILT

962
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:14,200
TO ENDOW MIDVALE COLLEGE
WITH $1 MILLION.

963
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:17,800
$1 MILLION?
W-W-WHY, THAT'S WONDERFUL.

964
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:20,800
ALTHOUGH WE'VE HAD
OUR DISAGREEMENTS IN THE PAST,

965
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,800
I MUST SAY
THAT MR. DEARBORNE...

966
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,000
NOW, THERE
IS A CONDITION.

967
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,000
MR. ASTERBILT STIPULATES
FOOTBALL MUST BE ABOLISHED,

968
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,200
OR THE DEAL IS OFF.

969
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:30,200
IS A STUBBORN,
PIGHEADED FOOL.

970
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:32,000
I HAVE NO WISH TO ARGUE
WITH THE JUDGE OR--

971
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,400
DEARBORNE,
YOU POSITIVELY

972
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:37,000
HOLD THE WORLD'S RECORD
AT GRUDGE CARRYING.

973
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
JUST BECAUSE
YOU COULDN'T MAKE THE TEAM

974
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:39,200
WHEN YOU WERE
A STUDENT HERE,

975
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,200
YOU'RE FOREVER SNIPING

976
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:42,400
AT MIDVALE FOOTBALL.

977
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:45,000
THERE IS NO CAUSE
FOR ANGER, JUDGE.

978
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,200
WE CAN KEEP FOOTBALL
AT MIDVALE,

979
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:51,200
OR WE CAN HAVE $1 MILLION.

980
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,200
TAKE YOUR CHOICE.

981
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,200
OF COURSE, FOOTBALL

982
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:58,000
DOES TAKE TIME AWAY
FROM STUDIES.

983
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,400
AND THERE'S ALWAYS THE DANGER
THAT SOMEONE WILL GET HURT.

984
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,800
AND IT CREATES
THE WRONG KIND OF ATMOSPHERE

985
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,400
FOR AN INSTITUSION
OF HIGHER LEARNING.

986
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:08,400
WELL, GENTLEMEN,
WE ALL SEEM TO BE IN AGREEMENT,

987
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:09,800
UH, ALMOST ALL,
THAT IS.

988
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:10,800
TWO WEEKS FROM TODAY,

989
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:14,400
MR. ASTERBILT
WILL BE HERE WITH A CHECK

990
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:17,000
FOR $1 MILLION.

991
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,200
AND AT THAT TIME,

992
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:20,000
FOOTBALL AT MIDVALE

993
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:22,400
WILL COME TO AN END.

994
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:33,200
THERE'S SOMEONE
TO SEE YOU, JUDGE.

995
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:34,400
I DON'T WANT
TO SEE ANYONE.

996
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:37,200
HIS NAME
IS DARIUS GREEN III.

997
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:38,800
I DON'T KNOW
ANY DARIUS GREEN.

998
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,000
HE'S IN THE STUDY.

999
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,800
I COULDN'T GET RID OF HIM.
MAYBE YOU CAN.

1000
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:47,000
JUDGE HOLMSBY,
I'M GLAD TO MEET YOU.

1001
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,600
I'M DARIUS GREEN III.

1002
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:50,600
WELL, MR. GREEN,
I'M A VERY BUSY MAN.

1003
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:54,000
SO AM I, BUT I'M GONNA READ YOU
A POEM ABOUT MY GRANDDADDY.

1004
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:55,600
I TOLD YOU,
I AM VERY BUSY.

1005
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:58,000
AND IT MIGHT MEAN
A VERY BIG ENDOWMENT

1006
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,400
TO MIDVALE COLLEGE.

1007
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:03,200
HOWEVER, I'M NEVER TOO BUSY
TO LISTEN TO A GOOD POEM.

1008
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:05,000
AH, I KNEW YOU WEREN'T.

1009
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,600
UH, UH, THE NAME
OF THIS POEM

1010
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:11,400
IS DARIUS GREEN
AND HIS FLYING MACHINE.

1011
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:12,600
INTERESTING TITLE.

1012
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:14,600
THAT WOULD BE DARIUS GREEN I,
I PRESUME.

1013
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:18,000
MY GRANDDADDY.

1014
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,000
"AN ASPIRING GENIUS
WAS DARIUS GREEN.

1015
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,600
"SON OF A FARMER,
AGE 14.

1016
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:26,400
"HIS BODY WAS LONG
AND LANK AND LEAN,

1017
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:29,800
JUST RIGHT FOR FLYING,
AS WE'LL BE SEEING."

1018
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:34,400
"THE BIRDS CAN FLY,
AND WHY CAN'T I?

1019
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,600
"'MUST WE GIVE IN,'
HE SAID WITH A GRIN.

1020
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:40,600
"JUST FOLD OUR HANDS
AND LET THE 'SWALLER'

1021
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:43,200
AND BLACKBIRD AND CATBIRD
BEAT US HOLLER."

1022
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,400
THAT WAS GOOD THINKING,
MR. GREEN.

1023
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:46,400
GRANDDADDY
WAS SMART,

1024
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:49,400
NO MATTER
WHAT THEY SAY.

1025
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:50,600
"SO, DAY AFTER DAY,

1026
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:53,200
"HE STITCHED AND TINKERED
AND HAMMERED AWAY

1027
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:54,600
"TILL AT LAST

1028
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:57,400
"THE GREATEST INVENTION

00:49:57,600 --> 00:50:01,000
"THEN, SAID DARIUS,
'HOORAY FOR SOME FUN.'"

1030
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,600
"HOORAY FOR SOME FUN."

1031
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:07,600
"SO THIS MODERN KNIGHT
PREPARED FOR FLIGHT,

1032
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:10,200
"PUT ON HIS WINGS

1033
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:12,600
"BUCKLED THEM FAST
TO SHOULDER AND HIP.

1034
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:15,200
TEN FEET THEY MEASURED
FROM TIP TO TIP."

1035
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:18,000
IMAGINE A WINGSPREAD
OF TEN FEET.

1036
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:22,200
"STEPPIN' CAREFUL,
HE TRAVELED THE LENGTH

1037
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:25,600
"OF HIS SPRINGBOARD AND TEETERED

1038
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:29,200
"NOW HE STRETCHES HIS WINGS

1039
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:32,400
"PEEKS OVER HIS SHOULDER
THIS WAY AND THAT.

1040
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:35,600
"FOR TO SEE
IF THERE'S ANYONE PASSING BY,

1041
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:39,200
TO SEE THE DRAGON
HE'S GOING TO FLY."

1042
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,600
GO ON, PLEASE.
GO ON.

1043
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:43,600
"AS A DEMON IS HURLED

1052
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:07,200
OH, HOW VERY SAD,
MR. GREEN.

1053
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,400
THERE IT IS, JUDGE.

1054
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:10,600
AND EVER SINCE,

1055
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:13,600
GRANDDADDY DARIUS HAS BEEN
TREATED LIKE A SIMPLETON,

1056
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:17,000
INSTEAD OF A MAN
WAY AHEAD OF HIS TIMES.

1057
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,200
JUST LOOK AT THE WAY
THEY DRAWED HIM.

1058
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:22,400
THEY WASN'T CONTENT
TO HAVE HIM ACT THE FOOL.

1059
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,600
THEY EVEN PICTURED HIM
LOOKING LIKE A FOOL.

1060
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:27,400
I GATHER YOU FEEL
YOUR ANCESTOR'S BEEN SLURRED,

1061
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:29,600
BUT WHAT CAN BE DONE
ABOUT IT NOW?

1062
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:32,000
WELL, I'D LIKE TO CLEAR
GRANDDADDY'S NAME

1063
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,000
BY PROVING A FELLA CAN FLY
UNDER HIS OWN POWER

1064
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,200
BY GETTING SOMEONE
TO DO IT.

1065
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:39,600
THAT'S WHY I CAME
ALL THE WAY FROM VERMONT

1066
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:41,200
TO SEE YOU.

1067
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,600
TO SEE ME?

1068
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:43,600
WELL, I HEARD
YOU WERE A MEMBER

1069
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:45,600
OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS
AT MIDVALE COLLEGE.

1070
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:46,600
YES, I AM.

1071
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:50,200
I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU
A QUESTION.

1072
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:53,200
WOULD MIDVALE CONSIDER
AN ENDOWMENT OF $10 MILLION

1073
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:56,400
ENOUGH TO GET THEM INTERESTED
IN WORKING ON THIS HERE IDEA?

1074
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:01,200
WHAT'S SO FUNNY?

1075
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:04,400
WELL, FOR A MINUTE,
IT SOUNDED AS THOUGH--

1076
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:07,600
IT SOUNDED LIKE YOU SAID,
"$10 MILLION."

1077
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:09,200
THAT'S WHAT I DID SAY.

1078
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:14,400
$10 MILLION?

1079
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:16,200
THAT'S RIGHT.

1080
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:19,200
ONE, ZERO...

1081
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:22,400
ZERO, ZERO, ZERO...

1082
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,600
ZERO, ZERO, ZERO?

1083
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:26,600
DON'T WORRY, JUDGE.

1084
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:28,600
YOU CAN LOOK ME UP AND DOWN
ON BRIDE STREET.

1085
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:30,600
YOU'LL FIND
I'M PRETTY WELL FIXED.

1086
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:32,800
OH, I'M NOT WORRYING
ABOUT YOU, MR. GREEN.

1087
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:35,400
BUT I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU
ONE QUESTION.

1088
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:37,600
HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT FOOTBALL?

1089
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:38,800
OH, I LIKE IT.

1090
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:41,200
UH, BUT I CAN'T PLAY
WITH YOU TODAY.

1091
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:44,200
MR. GREEN, YOU HAVE JUST SAVED
FOOTBALL AT MIDVALE COLLEGE.

1092
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,600
WHY ARE WE TALKING
ABOUT FOOTBALL?

1093
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:50,400
BECAUSE YOUR GENEROSITY LETS
MIDVALE TURN DOWN ANOTHER OFFER,

1094
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:51,400
ONE WITH STRINGS ATTACHED.

1095
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:53,200
WELL, MINE
HAS STRINGS, TOO.

1096
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:55,600
NOT ONE CENT DO YOU GET

1097
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:59,800
UNTIL YOU REALLY PROVE A MAN
CAN FLY UNDER HIS OWN POWER.

1098
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:02,200
NOW, DO YOU THINK MIDVALE
HAS THE KNOW-HOW?

1099
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:03,400
OH, POSITIVELY.

1100
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:05,400
ARE YOU SURE THEY HAVE?
ABSOLUTELY.

1101
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:06,800
WE'VE GOT--

1102
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,200
WELL--

1103
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,600
W-WE HAVE
AN ABSOLUTE GENIUS HERE,

1104
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,600
MERLIN JONES--
HE CAN PROVE ANYTHING.

1105
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:13,800
OH, I'D LIKE TO MEET HIM.

1106
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:15,400
BUT--YOU CAN.

1107
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:16,600
IT'S ABOUT LUNCHTIME.

1108
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:18,600
WE'LL GO OVER
TO THE CAMPUS CAFE.

1109
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:20,600
UH, MERLIN WAITS
ON TABLES THERE.

1110
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:22,400
WHAT'S A GENIUS DOING
WAITING ON TABLES?

1111
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:25,400
WHY NOT? I HEARD EINSTEIN USED
TO WAIT ON TABLES, TOO.

1112
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:26,600
DID HE?

1113
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:36,600
I'M VERY SORRY, SIR.

1114
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:39,400
I HEAR THAT EINSTEIN WASN'T
A VERY GOOD WAITER EITHER.

1115
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:41,400
I'LL GET YOU
SOME MORE CLAM CHOWDER, SIR.

1116
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:43,200
I DIDN'T ORDER
CLAM CHOWDER.

1117
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:44,600
I JUST WANT A SALAD.
YES, SIR.

1118
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,200
OH, BY THE WAY, JUDGE,

1119
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:47,600
STANLEY AND I HAVE BEEN WORKING
ON A PROJECT--

1120
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:49,600
WHO'S STANLEY?
OH, I'LL HAVE
A SALAD, TOO.

1121
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:50,600
YES, SIR. RIGHT AWAY, SIR.

1122
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:52,000
STANLEY IS MY--

1123
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,800
EH, EH, WE WANT
THE SALADS NOW.
YES, SIR.

1124
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:55,400
HE, MERLIN, HOW
ABOUT SOME MORE WATER?

1125
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:56,400
COMING.

1126
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:57,800
AND HE'S THE GENIUS
AT MIDVALE?

1127
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:58,600
WELL, I KNOW YOU HAVE

1128
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:00,400
AN UNFORTUNATE
FIRST IMPRESSION OF HIM,

1129
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:02,600
BUT YOU'LL SEE,
HE'LL SURPRISE YOU.

1130
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:06,200
HE'S GIVEN ME
A FEW SURPRISES ALREADY.

1131
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:07,200
WHO'S STANLEY?

1132
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:10,200
EH, YEAH, WELL, STANLEY
IS HIS NEPHEW--

1133
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:11,400
A CHIMPANZEE.

1134
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:12,600
A CHIMPANZEE?

1135
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,800
YES. I SIGNED
THE COURT ORDER MYSELF.

1136
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:17,600
HE'S LEGALLY
THE MONKEY'S UNCLE.

1137
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:21,400
COME ON, MERLIN,
WHERE'S THAT WATER?

1138
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:23,200
SURE, HERE YOU ARE.

1139
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:24,800
I'M GETTING TOO FAST
FOR YOU, MERLIN.

1140
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:25,800
YOU MISSED ME THAT TIME.

1141
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:27,600
GEE, I'M SORRY, SIR.

1142
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:28,600
DON'T LET IT WORRY YOU.

1143
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,200
THAT'S YOUR FIRST MISS
OF THE DAY.

1144
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,200
OH, NO,
WHAT I MEANT WAS--

1145
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:33,800
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEANT.
YES, YES, OF COURSE.

1146
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:35,800
MERLIN, MERLIN,
YOU SEE, MR. GREEN

1147
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:38,600
HAS OFFERED MIDVALE
A VERY GENEROUS ENDOWMENT.

1148
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:39,600
THAT'S WONDERFUL.

1149
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:41,200
BUT--BUT--
BUT IT ALL DEPENDS

1150
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:44,200
ON YOUR BEING ABLE TO
DEMONSTRATE MAN-POWERED FLIGHT.

1151
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:47,000
MAN-POWERED FLIGHT?

1152
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,400
YES.

1153
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:49,600
BY MAN-POWERED FLIGHT,

1154
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:51,600
DO YOU MEAN
NO GAS-INFLATED DEVICES?

1155
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:52,600
RIGHT.

1156
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:54,800
NOTHING THAT USES FUEL
OR THAT GETS ITS POWER

1157
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:56,400
FROM ANYTHING
OTHER THAN A MAN'S MUSCLES?

1158
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:58,400
YES.
YES, THAT'S RIGHT.

1159
00:54:58,400 --> 00:54:59,800
TAKEOFF MAN-POWERED,

1160
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:02,600
FLIGHT MAINTAINED BY MAN POWER,
AND LANDING MAN-POWERED?

1161
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:05,000
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I MEAN.

1162
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,800
IT CAN'T BE DONE.

1163
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:08,200
WELL, HE MEANS

1164
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:09,800
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT,

1165
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:11,200
UH, BUT, OF COURSE,
IT CAN BE DONE.

1166
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:12,800
NO, WHAT
I MEANT WAS--

1167
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:15,000
MERLIN, WILL YOU GET ME
A GLASS OF WATER?

1168
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,400
OH, BUT YOU ALREADY HAVE
A GLASS OF WATER.

1169
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:19,400
NO, THE THING
ABOUT MAN-POWERED FLIGHT--

1170
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:20,800
WELL, THEN BRING US COFFEE
AND--AND THE CHECK.

1171
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:22,600
YES, SIR.

1172
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:25,000
YOU SEE, A BRILLIANT YOUNG MAN
LIKE MERLIN--

1173
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,800
OH, UH, WOULD YOU LIKE CREAM
IN YOUR COFFEE, SIR?

1174
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:27,800
NO. YES, YES.

1175
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:29,600
NO. YES, YES.

1176
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,800
IF THAT BOY
CAN'T HANDLE IT,

1177
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:35,800
I GUESS I'LL TAKE MY OFFER OVER
TO THAT OTHER COLLEGE NEAR HERE.

1178
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:38,000
R-RANDALL?
OH, THAT WOULD BE VERY STUPID--

1179
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,200
UNWISE.

1180
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:41,800
I MEAN, THERE ISN'T ANYONE
LIKE MERLIN JONES AT RANDALL.

1181
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:44,600
I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYONE
LIKE MERLIN JONES ANYWHERE.

1182
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:46,600
OH, YOU'RE QUITE RIGHT,
MR. GREEN.

1183
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:49,400
THERE'S ONLY ONE MERLIN JONES,
AND MIDVALE HAS HIM.

1184
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:52,000
THAT'S WHY I THINK I'LL TAKE
MY OFFER OVER TO RANDALL.

1185
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,400
BUT--I WILL GIVE YOU
MY PERSONAL GUARANTEE

1186
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:57,600
THAT MERLIN JONES
CAN DO THE JOB FOR YOU.

1187
00:55:57,600 --> 00:55:59,000
BUT HE DOESN'T THINK
HE CAN.

1188
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,400
OH, THAT'S JUST A SCIENTIST'S
APPROACH TO THE PROBLEM.

1189
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,400
YOU SEE, YOU START OFF

1190
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:05,200
BY ASSUMING WHAT YOU'RE TRYING
TO DO IS IMPOSSIBLE,

1191
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:06,600
THEN YOU GO AHEAD
AND DO IT.

1192
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:07,400
IT'S WHAT'S CALLED

1193
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:10,400
THE, UH, PROVING
THE IMPOSSIBLE THEOREM.

1194
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:13,800
MR. GREEN, HOW HIGH WOULD A MAN
HAVE TO FLY TO SATISFY YOU?

1195
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
TEN FEET.

1196
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,400
AND HOW LONG
WOULD HE HAVE TO SUSTAIN IT?

1197
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:19,400
ABOUT FIVE MINUTES.
FIVE MINUTES.

1198
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:21,400
300 SECONDS.

1199
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:24,600
I THINK MERLIN'S GOT SOMETHING
FIGURED OUT ALREADY,

1200
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:25,800
RIGHT, MERLIN?
MM-HMM.

1201
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:27,000
I JUST FIGURED OUT
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

1202
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,200
THERE, YOU SEE?

1203
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:30,600
THAT'S A SCIENTIFIC APPROACH,
PROVING THE IMPOSSIBLE,

1204
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:32,600
RIGHT, MR. GREEN?

1205
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:34,400
WELL, I DON'T KNOW, JUDGE.

1206
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:36,800
IN VERMONT, WE DON'T MAKE UP
OUR MINDS SO FAST.

1207
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:38,800
WE LIKE TO GIVE
A LITTLE THOUGHT TO THINGS.

1208
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:41,000
AND QUITE RIGHT,
MR. GREEN.

1209
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,800
YOU LIKE TO GIVE
A LITTLE THOUGHT TO THINGS,

1210
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,400
SO DOES MERLIN,

1211
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:45,400
DON'T YOU, MERLIN?

1212
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:47,000
YOU CAN GIVE THIS
A LITTLE THOUGHT,

1213
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
CAN'T YOU,
FOR, UH, $10 MILLION?

1214
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,800
$10 MILLION?
HA HA!

1215
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:53,800
THERE, YOU SEE, MR. GREEN?
THE CHECK, PLEASE.

1216
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:56,600
NO, NO, NO,
I INSIST.

1217
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:58,000
UH, YOU ARE A GUEST
AT MIDVALE,

1218
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,800
AND I WILL NOT HAVE YOU
SPENDING ONE CENT.

1219
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:02,800
MERLIN...

1220
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:04,600
MR. GREEN AND I HAVE
COMPLETE CONFIDENCE IN YOU.

1221
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:07,000
FROM NOW ON, MAN-POWERED FLIGHT
IS COMPLETELY IN YOUR HANDS.

1222
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,800
THIS WAY,
THIS WAY, MR. GREEN.

1223
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:15,800
MERLIN, WHY DON'T YOU HURRY UP
AND INVENT THAT PLANE

1224
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,600
SO YOU CAN TAKE ME
TO THE MOVIE?

1225
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:19,000
IT'S NOT
AS EASY AS THAT.

1226
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,400
WHY NOT?

1227
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,200
JENNIFER, CAN'T YOU SEE
WHAT A MAN'S UP AGAINST

1228
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:24,400
WHEN HE TRIES TO FLY
UNDER HIS OWN POWER?

1229
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:25,600
STANLEY,
GIVE ME THE BIRD.

1230
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:31,000
THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT.

1231
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,800
I WANT THIS BIRD.

1232
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:35,400
SEE HOW IT'S DESIGNED
FOR FLIGHT?

1233
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:36,200
LOOK AT THE BODY--

1234
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:38,600
STREAMLINED
FOR CUTTING THROUGH THE AIR.

1235
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:39,800
IT'S CUTE.

1236
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:41,400
MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL
ARE THE AIR CAVITIES

1237
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:43,200
THAT MAKE A BIRD'S BONES
VERY LIGHT.

1238
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:45,800
MAN'S BONES ARE SOLID.

1239
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:47,000
DON'T THE WINGS
HELP, TOO?

1240
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,200
OF COURSE THEY HELP.

1241
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:50,600
BUT MAN WAS DESIGNED
FOR WALKING.

1242
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:52,600
MAN MAYBE,
BUT NOT WOMAN.

1243
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:55,000
WALKING IN THESE SHOES
IS TORTURE.

1244
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,600
I MEAN
BOTH MAN AND WOMAN.

1245
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:58,800
CERTAINLY YOU WEREN'T DESIGNED
FOR FLYING.

1246
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,600
OF COURSE NOT.
I HAVE NO WINGS.

1247
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:02,000
NO WINGS
AND HEAVY LEGS.

1248
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,200
REALLY, MERLIN!

1249
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:06,400
OH, NO, JEN, I DIDN'T MEAN
YOUR LEGS PERSONALLY.

1250
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:08,400
I MEANT MAN'S LEGS
IN GENERAL.

1251
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:13,000
BUT DO YOU THINK MY LEGS
ARE TOO HEAVY?

1252
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,400
OF COURSE NOT.

1253
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,800
I THINK YOUR LEGS ARE...

1254
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:20,000
HOW DID WE EVER GET
INTO A DISCUSSION ON YOUR LEGS?

1255
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,600
YOU WERE CRITICIZING
MY FIGURE.

1256
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:23,600
LOOK, JEN, ON THE GROUND,
YOUR FIGURE IS GORGEOUS,

1257
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:25,600
AND THAT BIRD'S
IS RIDICULOUS.

1258
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:28,000
BUT HIS WAS DESIGNED FOR FLYING,
AND YOURS WASN'T.

1259
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,200
WELL, I JUST WON'T FLY THEN,
THAT'S ALL.

1260
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:32,000
WELL, SOMEONE'S GOT TO,

1261
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,800
OR MIDVALE'S OUT $10 MILLION
AND ONE FOOTBALL TEAM.

1262
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:37,800
I DON'T SEE
HOW THAT'S POSSIBLE

1263
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,800
AFTER WHAT
YOU'VE JUST EXPLAINED.

1264
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
AFTER ALL,
MAN ISN'T STREAMLINED,

1265
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,800
AND HE'S GOT CAVITIES
IN HIS TEETH

1266
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:45,000
INSTEAD OF HIS LEGS.

1267
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,200
YOU'RE FORGETTING
JUST ONE THING.

1268
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:48,200
AND MAN
DOESN'T HAVE WINGS?

1269
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:52,200
NO, SOMETHING HE DOES HAVE--
A HIGHLY DEVELOPED BRAIN.

1270
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:56,000
MAN'S BRAIN IS ALWAYS ENABLING
HIM TO DO THE IMPOSSIBLE.

1271
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,200
MERLIN, I CAN JUST SEE
YOU NOW,

1272
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:00,600
FLYING THROUGH THE AIR,
SOARING THROUGH THE SKIES!

1273
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:03,600
WELL, NO, JEN,
I WON'T BE DOING THE FLYING.

1274
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:04,800
YOU WON'T?

1275
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:06,000
WHO WILL?
I DON'T KNOW.

1276
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,200
WE'LL PROBABLY GET
A FOOTBALL PLAYER--

1277
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:10,000
SOMEONE WITH AS MUCH MUSCLE AND
AS LITTLE WEIGHT AS POSSIBLE.

1278
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,600
I JUST PROVIDE
THE BRAINPOWER.

1279
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:16,200
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG.

1280
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:22,800
THAT'S IT,

1281
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:24,800
THE CUBE
OF THE VELOCITY.

1282
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:26,200
THANK YOU, STANLEY.

1283
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,800
SO, GENTLEMEN,
THE MIDVALE FOOTBALL TEAM

1284
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:34,200
IS ONCE AGAIN THREATENED
BY MR. DEARBORNE.

1285
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:39,600
ONCE AGAIN, ONCE AGAIN,
THE FATE OF THE TEAM

1286
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:42,600
IS IN THE HANDS AND THE BRAIN
OF MERLIN JONES.

1287
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:47,600
FOR NOW,
I CAN REVEAL TO YOU

1288
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:50,000
THAT MERLIN IS WORKING
ON A SECRET PROJECT,

1289
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,600
WHICH, IF SUCCESSFUL,

1290
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:54,800
WILL BRING TO MIDVALE
AN ENDOWMENT OF $10 MILLION.

1291
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:57,800
AND WITH $10 MILLION,

1292
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,200
WE CAN UTTERLY REJECT
MR. ASTERBILT'S $1 MILLION,

1293
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:03,000
AND THE CONDITIONS
THAT GO WITH IT,

1294
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,800
AND PRESERVE FOOTBALL
AT MIDVALE FOREVER.

1295
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:09,800
HOWEVER,

1296
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:12,200
MERLIN IS NOW AT A STAGE
IN THIS PROJECT

1297
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:15,000
WHERE HE DOES NEED
THE ASSISTANCE OF ONE MAN.

1298
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,800
AND I BELIEVE THE MU MUS
SHOULD HAVE THE HONOR

1299
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:19,000
OF PROVIDING THAT MAN.

1300
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:25,400
AS HEAD OF THIS FRATERNITY,
I VOLUNTEER THE SERVICES

1301
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:27,400
OF EVERY SINGLE MU MU
IN THIS ROOM!

1302
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,400
FINE, HAYWOOD, FINE.

1303
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:34,000
NOW, ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS DECIDE
WHICH ONE IT WILL BE.

1304
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,400
MERLIN HAS THE NAMES
OF FOUR MEN

1305
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:37,200
WHOM HE THINKS HAVE
THE RIGHT QUALIFICATIONS.

1306
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:38,400
CALL THEM OUT, MERLIN.

1307
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:39,800
THEN WE'LL DRAW STRAWS

1308
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:41,600
AND SEE WHO THE LUCKY ONE
WILL BE.

1309
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:43,800
YES, SIR.
JIM ANDREWS.

1310
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,200
LEON.

1311
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:53,800
A.J. COBB.

1312
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:54,800
ME?!

1313
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,000
AND, FINALLY,

1314
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,000
NORMAN!

1315
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,800
HEY, MERLIN,
WHAT IS THIS SECRET PROJECT?

1316
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:03,800
MAN-POWERED FLIGHT--

1317
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:06,200
A FLYING MACHINE POWERED
ONLY BY A MAN'S MUSCLES.

1318
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:08,000
IT'LL NEVER WORK.
MAYBE NOT.

1319
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,000
BUT WE'RE GONNA TRY.

1320
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,200
WE?

1321
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:11,400
SURE.

1322
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:13,800
ME AND WHICHEVER ONE OF YOU WINS
THE JOB OF FLYING IT.

1323
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:15,400
FLYING IT?!

1324
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:17,600
YOU MEAN ONE OF US
IS GONNA FLY IT?

1325
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:19,600
I DON'T THINK
I'M THE RIGHT MAN FOR THE JOB.

1326
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:20,800
I GOT THIS SINUS CONDITION.

1327
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:22,000
YEAH,
AND I GOT DANDRUFF.

1328
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,200
OH, REALLY, I DO.
LOOK.

1329
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:25,800
JUST ONE MOMENT.

1330
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:28,000
MU MU HONOR IS AT STAKE.

1331
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,400
WE'LL GO AHEAD
AND DRAW STRAWS.

1332
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:31,600
THE LONGEST ONE LOSES.

1333
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:33,000
I MEAN WINS--

1334
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,200
WINS THE HONOR OF FLYING.

1335
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:37,200
QUIET.
QUIET, GENTLEMEN!

1336
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:38,000
QUIET.

1337
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:40,000
REMEMBER,
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT MOMENT.

1338
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
LINE UP, PLEASE.

1339
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:49,800
NORMAN.

1340
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
JIM.

1341
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:27,400
A.J.

1342
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,200
LEON.

1343
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:03,800
QUIET!
FELLAS, QUIET! QUIET!

1344
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:05,400
MY BOY,
I WANT YOU TO KNOW

1345
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:07,400
THAT MIDVALE WILL ALWAYS
REMEMBER AND APPRECIATE

1346
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:08,800
WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO,

1347
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:11,000
NO MATTER WHETHER
IT'S SUCCESSFUL OR NOT.

1348
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:13,400
IN FACT, I INTEND TO INTRODUCE
A RESOLUTION

1349
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:14,400
TO THE BOARD OF REGENTS,

1350
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:16,400
ASKING THEM TO NAME
THE STADIUM AFTER YOU.

1351
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:18,800
NO FOOLING?

1352
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:20,400
NO FOOLING.

1353
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:23,400
JUST THINK, 90,000 CHEERING
STUDENTS IN YOUR STADIUM--

1354
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:26,200
THE LEON MEMORIAL STADIUM.

1355
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:27,400
MEMORIAL STADIUM?!

1356
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:31,000
WELL, UH, I JUST CALLED IT

1357
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:32,400
THE FIRST THING
THAT CAME INTO MY HEAD.

1358
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:34,400
YOU CAN CALL IT
ANYTHING YOU'D LIKE.

1359
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:36,000
I WANT TO CALL IT QUITS.

1360
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:40,400
I DON'T THINK SO...

1361
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:41,800
ARE YOU READY, LEON?

1362
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:44,200
I SUPPOSE SO.

1363
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:47,400
OH, LEON,
YOU LOOK WONDERFUL.

1364
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:49,000
I DO?
OF COURSE YOU DO.

1365
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:51,200
MY BOY, THIS IS THE LAST STEP
IN YOUR TRAINING.

1366
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:52,000
I WANT YOU TO SEE A FILM

1367
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:54,000
OF VARIOUS FLYING MACHINES
IN ACTION.

1368
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:55,400
LIGHTS, PLEASE,
JENNIFER.

1369
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:57,800
THERE'S ALWAYS A CHANCE TO LEARN
FROM OTHER PEOPLE'S MISTAKES.

1370
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:00,000
SOME OF THESE FLYING MACHINES
ARE MOTOR-DRIVEN,

1371
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,800
SO, OF COURSE, CAN'T BE USED
IN MAN-POWERED FLIGHT.

1372
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:05,400
STANLEY?

1373
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:06,600
BUT WE'RE INTERESTED

1374
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:09,200
IN THE SCIENTIFIC THINKING
THAT WENT INTO DESIGNING THEM--

1375
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:11,800
THE AERODYNAMICS,
THE THEORY OF FLIGHT.

1376
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:17,800
ANY FOOL CAN SEE THIS WILL
NEVER GET OFF THE GROUND.

1377
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:19,800
CAN'T YOU, LEON?
SURE.

1378
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:23,200
AT LEAST THIS FELLA KNEW
THAT THE HEAVIER THE LOAD,

1379
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:25,200
THE MORE POWER NEEDED
FOR LIFTING,

1380
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:27,000
SO HE KEPT
THE WEIGHT DOWN.

1381
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:33,200
KEPT EVERYTHING ELSE DOWN, TOO.

1382
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:38,800
I WONDER IF MR. GREEN
WOULD OKAY ROCKETS.

1383
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:47,200
OH, GUESS NOT.

1384
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:50,000
ANY FLYING MACHINE
NEEDS THE LIGHTEST

1385
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:53,200
AND STRONGEST MATERIALS
POSSIBLE.

1386
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:02,400
LIGHT ENOUGH TO LIFT

1387
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:05,200
AND STRONG ENOUGH TO HOLD
TOGETHER UNDER PRESSURE.

1388
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:11,000
THIS IS NEITHER.

1389
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:15,200
NOW WE COME TO THE ORNITHOPTIC
APPROACH TO FLYING.

1390
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:21,400
TRYING TO FLY
BY IMITATING

1391
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:24,000
THE UP-AND-DOWN MOVEMENT
OF A BIRD'S WINGS,

1392
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:25,200
NOT UNLIKE TRYING TO SWIM

1393
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:28,000
BY IMITATING THE WIGGLE
OF A FISH'S TAIL.

1394
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,600
THESE FELLAS
JUST DIDN'T UNDERSTAND

1395
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:31,600
THE FUNDAMENTALS OF FLYING.

1396
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:42,000
NOW WE SEE THE APPLICATION
OF SCIENTIFIC PRINCIPLES.

1397
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,400
THIS WING STRUCTURE
REPRESENTS A GREAT ADVANCE.

1398
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:03,400
BUT IT ISN'T
QUITE PERFECT.

1399
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,200
ALTHOUGH IT LOOKS DIFFERENT,
THAT FLYING MACHINE

1400
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:09,000
IS ACTUALLY
VERY MUCH LIKE OURS.

1401
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:13,400
WE'LL LOOK AROUND AND SEE IF
WE CAN FIND A CLIFF LIKE THAT

1402
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:14,400
TO LAUNCH YOU FROM,

1403
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:17,200
TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF THE AIR CURRENTS.

1404
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:29,400
I GUESS THERE WERE
NO AIR CURRENTS THAT DAY.

1405
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:30,400
IT SHOULD'VE FLOWN.

1406
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:32,000
LIGHTS.

1407
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:35,600
THE IMPORTAN THING, LEON,
THAT WE'VE LEARNED IS--

1408
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:37,200
LEON?

1409
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:39,200
LEON?!

1410
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:40,600
WHAT ON EARTH
ARE YOU DOING?!

1411
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:42,000
I'M TAKING OFF,

1412
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,600
BUT WITH BOTH FEET
ON THE GROUND.

1413
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:46,200
DIDN'T YOU LEARN ANYTHING
FROM THE FILM?

1414
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:48,200
SURE. I LEARNED
WHAT KIND OF A BIRD I AM--

1415
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:50,200
CHICKEN.

1416
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:57,600
YOU KNOW, LEON,
THIS MAN-POWERED FLIGHT PROJECT

1417
01:06:57,600 --> 01:07:00,000
IS MAKING YOU THE HERO
OF THE CAMPUS.

1418
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,600
ALL THE GIRLS SIGH
WHENEVER YOUR NAME IS MENTIONED.

1419
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:03,600
THEY DO?

1420
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:05,600
AND SO DO I.

1421
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:06,600
YOU DO?

1422
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:07,600
YOU DO?

1423
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:08,800
JUST THINK,

1424
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:10,400
A MAN FLYIING
UNDER HIS OWN POWER.

1425
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:12,600
AH, I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT IT.

1426
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:13,600
IT'S FOR THE BIRDS.

1427
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:15,600
OH, IT'S SUCH
A ROMANTIC IDEA,

1428
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:18,000
LIKE THE CONQUEST
OF SPACE,

1429
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,600
LIKE THOSE
ADORABLE ASTRONAUTS,

1430
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:22,200
LIKE THE PIONEERS
OF THE AMERICAN WEST,

1431
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:23,600
LIKE THE BOLD EXPLORERS

1432
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:25,400
WHO FIRST CHARTED
THE POLAR REGIONS.

1433
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:27,000
YOUR NAME
WILL GO DOWN IN HISTORY

1434
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,200
ALONGSIDE THE OTHER
GREAT ONES--COLUMBUS,

1435
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:31,400
LINDBERGH,
AND THAT LITTLE DOG

1436
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:33,200
THE RUSSIANS
FIRST SHOT INTO SPACE.

1437
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:34,400
WHAT WAS
THE LITTLE DOG'S NAME?

1438
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:36,200
I DON'T REMEMBER.

1439
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:39,200
BUT YOUR NAME WILL BE
REMEMBERED FOREVER.

1440
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:40,400
IT WILL?

1441
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:43,600
YOU MEAN LIKE COLUMBUS?

1442
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:45,200
AND LINDBERGH?

1443
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:48,000
AND THAT
LITTLE RUSSIAN DOG?

1444
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,600
WHEN DO WE TAKE OFF?
TOMORROW.

1445
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:50,600
THAT'S TOO SOON.

1446
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:51,800
IT'S ONLY A TEST FLIGHT

1447
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:54,200
TO GIVE YOU CONFIDENCE
AND EXPERIENCE.

1448
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:55,600
FOR THE OFFICIAL FLIGHT,
OF COURSE,

1449
01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:57,000
YOU'LL HAVE TO TAKE OFF
UNDER YOUR OWN POWER.

1450
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
BUT TOMORROW
WE'RE GOING TO LAUNCH YOU

1451
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,200
FROM THE TOP OF A CAR
GOING 90 MILES AN HOUR.

1452
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:03,000
90 MILES AN HOUR?!

1453
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:06,200
YOU'RE NOT AFRAID OF GOING
90 MILES AN HOUR, NOT YOU.

1454
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:09,000
WELL, IT'S JUST
THAT IT'S ILLEGAL, A-AND IT'S--

1455
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,800
YES, I'M AFRAID.

1456
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:12,400
AW, DON'T LET THE
90-MILE-AN-HOUR PART SCARE YOU.

1457
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:13,400
WE'LL LAUNCH YOU AT 60.

1458
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:14,400
SMILE, LEON.

1459
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:16,600
YOU LOOK AS THOUGH
YOU'VE BEEN SENTENCED TO DEATH.

1460
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:18,400
WELL, NOW THAT
YOU MENTION IT.

1461
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:20,000
LEON, I'M GOING TO ELIMINATE
YOUR FEARS.

1462
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,600
YOU'RE CALLING
THE WHOLE THING OFF?

1463
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:24,200
NO, MERLIN'S GOING TO PREPARE
YOU PSYCHOLOGICALLY.

1464
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:26,200
CONSIDER THE BUMBLEBEE.

1465
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:28,600
NOW SCIENTISTS KNOW THAT
IT'S AERODYNAMICALLY UNSOUND

1466
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:30,200
AND SHOULDN'T BE ABLE
TO FLY.

1467
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:31,400
BUT THE BUMBLEBEE
DOESN'T KNOW IT.

1468
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:32,600
SO HE GOES
AND FLIES ANYWAY.

1469
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:33,600
AND THE BIRD DOESN'T WORRY

1470
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:35,200
ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT
HE CAN GET OFF THE GROUND.

1471
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:37,600
HE JUST TAKES OFF
AND FLIES.

1472
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:39,000
AND MERLIN WANTS YOU
TO THINK LIKE A BIRD.

1473
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:41,400
HOW DO I DO THAT?
WE'RE GOING TO HELP YOU.

1474
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:44,200
YOU'RE GOING TO SLEEP HERE,
AND I'LL SING TO YOU ALL NIGHT.

1475
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:46,200
AND WILL YOU HOLD MY HAND?

1476
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:48,600
I'M NOT GOING TO BE HERE.
I'LL SING TO YOU ON A RECORD.

1477
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:50,600
I SEE.
IT'S SLEEP
LEARNING, LEON,

1478
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:54,200
THE SAME TECHNIQUE THAT GOT YOU
AN "A" IN ENGLISH LIT.

1479
01:08:54,200 --> 01:08:55,800
THAT'S HOW YOU'RE GOING TO LEARN
TO THINK LIKE A BIRD.

1480
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:59,200
AND TOMORROW YOU'LL BE THE FIRST
MAN TO FLY UNDER HIS OWN POWER.

1481
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:01,600
THERE YOU ARE, LEON.
NOW, TO BED WE GO.

1482
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:05,000
JUST RELAX,
AND DON'T WORRY ABOUT A THING.

1483
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:09,800
JUST EMPTY YOUR MIND.

1484
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:14,400
THAT'S IT.
VERY GOOD.

1485
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:15,600
I CAN SEE
BY THE LOOK ON YOUR FACE,

1486
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:17,400
YOU DON'T HAVE
A THOUGHT IN YOUR HEAD.

1487
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:19,400
JUST KEEP IT THAT WAY.

1488
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:22,600
YOUR HEAD
IS AN EMPTY CUP,

1489
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:25,400
WHICH WE WILL FILL WITH
THE THOUGHTS WE WANT IN IT.

1490
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:26,600
GOOD NIGHT, LEON.

1491
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:28,000
PLEASANT DREAMS.

1492
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:35,200
HELLO, LEON.

1493
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:37,600
I HAVE A MESSAGE FOR YOU.

1494
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:39,800
JUST SAY TO YOURSELF,

1495
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:43,600
"I CAN FLY LIKE A HAWK."

1496
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:53,000
OKAY, LEON,
HERE WE GO.

1497
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:54,200
UH, JENNIFER?

1498
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:55,200
YES, LEON?

1499
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:56,800
SING TO ME AGAIN.

1500
01:11:56,800 --> 01:12:00,600
ALL RIGHT, LEON.

1501
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:29,800
HE'S OKAY NOW.

1502
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:31,800
STANLEY, BE SURE
AND TRIP THE RELEASE

1503
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:33,800
AS SOON
AS I PUT ON THE BRAKE.

1504
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:45,600
25...

1505
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:48,400
30...

1506
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:49,600
35...

1507
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:51,400
40...

1508
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:06,400
52...

1509
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:07,600
54...

1510
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:12,600
60!

1511
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:17,800
YOU'VE DONE IT!
YOU'VE DONE IT!

1512
01:13:52,200 --> 01:13:55,200
MERLIN, CAN I ASK
A DUMB QUESTION?
SURE.

1513
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:57,600
HOW DOES HE LAND?

1514
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:59,800
THAT'S THE ONE BUG
I HAVEN'T IRONED OUT YET.

1515
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:07,000
I CAN FLY.

1516
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:08,800
I CAN...

1517
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,400
FLY?

1518
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:12,400
FLY?!

1519
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:14,800
I CAN'T FLY!

1520
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:16,600
HE'S FALLING!

1521
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:31,800
DON'T PANIC!
LAND ON THIS!

1522
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:35,000
RIGHT THERE, MERLIN.

1523
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:36,800
RIGHT THERE, RIGHT--NO.
HEY!

1524
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:38,000
OVER HERE, MERLIN!

1525
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:41,800
THAT'S THE WRONG WAY!

1526
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:43,200
THIS WAY!

1527
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:45,600
GET THAT THING
UNDER ME!

1528
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:47,600
MERLIN, HELP ME!
QUICK!

1529
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:49,600
FASTER.

1530
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:52,400
GO FASTER.
FASTER, FASTER, FASTER!

1531
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:54,600
I'M GOING QUICK.
DON'T WORRY!

1532
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:56,600
RUN FASTER, MERLIN.

1533
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:57,800
COME ON!

1534
01:14:57,800 --> 01:15:00,000
RUN FASTER, PLEASE!

1535
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,800
TH--THAT'S IT, MERLIN.

1536
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,400
BUT RUN FASTER!

1537
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:06,200
FASTER!

1538
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:08,000
FASTER!

1539
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,800
HELP!

1540
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
HELP!
SOMEBODY HELP!

1541
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:19,800
LOOK OUT
FOR THE HOG WALLOW!

1542
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:22,200
WHAT HOG WALLOW?!

1543
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,600
OH, LEON!

1544
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:43,000
LEON, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

1545
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:46,000
SAY SOMETHING, LEON.
WHY DOESN'T HE SAY ANYTHING?

1546
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:49,000
LEON, SAY SOMETHING.
ALL RIGHT, I WILL.

1547
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,200
I DON'T WANT
A MEMORIAL STADIUM.

1548
01:15:51,200 --> 01:15:52,600
I DON'T WANT TO GO DOWN
IN HISTORY

1549
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:55,000
WITH COLUMBUS
AND THE PIONEERS

1550
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,800
AND THAT LITTLE RUSSIAN DOG
WHOSE NAME YOU CAN'T REMEMBER.

1551
01:15:57,800 --> 01:15:59,000
I QUIT!

1552
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:00,800
K-W-I-T, "KWIT"!

1553
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:06,000
OH, MRS. GOSSETT,
ARE YOU SURE

1554
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,600
THERE'VE BEEN
NO CALLS FOR ME?

1555
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:09,200
THAT'S THE THIRD TIME
YOU'VE ASKED IN THE LAST HOUR.

1556
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:11,800
THIS IS GOOD. BEST EATIN' I HAD
SINCE I LEFT NEW ENGLAND.

1557
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,600
THANK YOU.
PLEASE HAVE SOME MORE.

1558
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:15,600
NO, THANKS.
I HAD THREE HELPINGS ALREADY.

1559
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:17,000
FOUR.

1560
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
OH, OH, BUT WHO COUNTS?

1561
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,200
I'LL GET IT.

1562
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:33,800
THE TEST--
HOW DID IT GO?

1563
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:38,800
IT WASN'T THAT BAD...

1564
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:40,200
WAS IT, JENNIFER?

1565
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:41,400
BUT...

1566
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:44,200
MERLIN, THE IMPORTANT THING IS,
YOU MUST NOT GIVE UP.

1567
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:46,400
IF YOU DON'T HAVE A MAN FLYING
WITHIN TWO DAYS,

1568
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:48,400
MIDVALE COLLEGE
LOSES $10 MILLION

1569
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:49,800
AND ITS FOOTBALL TEAM.

1570
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:51,000
JUDGE, TRY
AND UNDERSTAND.

1571
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:54,000
I TRIED TO GET AROUND THE LAWS
OF AERODYNAMICS AND FAILED.

1572
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,600
THE PROJECT WAS DOOMED
FROM THE START!

1573
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:58,000
SHH, QUIET, MERLIN.

1574
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:59,800
WE DON'T WANT MR. GREEN
TO GET DISCOURAGED.

1575
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:01,800
WHAT ABOUT ME?

1576
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,800
I'M DISCOURAGED
UP TO HERE.

1577
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:05,000
OH, BUT THAT'S DIFFERENT.

1578
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,200
DON'T YOU THINK EINSTEIN
WAS DISCOURAGED

1579
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:10,200
BEFORE HE DISCOVERED...
WHATEVER IT WAS HE DISCOVERED.

1580
01:17:10,200 --> 01:17:12,400
BUT DID HE GIVE UP?
NO, HE DID NOT.

1581
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:15,000
HE KEPT RIGHT ON
UNTIL HE DISCOVERED

1582
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
W-W-WHATEVER IT WAS
HE DISCOVERED.

1583
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:21,000
JUDGE, LISTEN,
"A," THE TEST FLIGHT WAS A BUST.

1584
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:24,200
"B," LEON QUIT.
"C," I QUIT.

1585
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:27,000
I'M SORRY, JUDGE.

1586
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:28,600
WAIT A MINUTE,
JENNIFER.

1587
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:30,000
IT'S UP TO YOU NOW.

1588
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:31,600
YOU MUST GET MERLIN
BACK ON THE TRACK.

1589
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:34,600
BUT I COULDN'T POSSIBLY--

1590
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:37,400
LISTEN, BEHIND EVERY MAN
WHO EVER ACCOMPLISHED ANYTHING,

1591
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:40,200
THERE'S A WOMAN
NAGGING HIM ON TO SUCCESS.

1592
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:41,200
ON YOUR FAIR SHOULDERS

1593
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:44,200
RESTS THE FORTUNE
OF MIDVALE COLLEGE.

1594
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:46,800
YOU MUST PERSUADE MERLIN
NOT TO GIVE UP.

1595
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,200
PERSUADE HIM?
HOW?

1596
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:52,400
GIRLS ARE BORN KNOWING HOW,
ESPECIALLY THE PRETTY ONES.

1597
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:54,600
COMING, JEN?

1598
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:56,000
GOOD NIGHT, JUDGE.

1599
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,800
GOOD NIGHT.

1600
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:08,600
THIS IS THE FINEST CIGAR
I EVER SMOKED.

1601
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:09,800
I'M GLAD
YOU'RE ENJOYING IT.

1602
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,400
THOUGHT I HEARD MERLIN.
WAS THAT MERLIN?

1603
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:13,800
MERLIN?
OH, MERLIN.

1604
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:15,000
YES, THAT WAS MERLIN.

1605
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,600
WELL, HOW DID
THE TEST FLIGHT GO?

1606
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:18,600
MARVELOUSLY.

1607
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:20,600
IT WAS A SMASHING SUCCESS,

1608
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:22,800
ABSOLUTELY SMASHING.

1609
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:26,200
WHAT MORE CAN I DO, JEN?
I'VE TRIED AND FAILED.

1610
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:29,400
QUITTERS NEVER WIN,
AND WINNERS NEVER QUIT.

1611
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:31,000
MAN CAN'T FLY
UNDER HIS OWN POWER.

1612
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:33,000
LOOK, IF YOU LIKE,
I CAN SHOW YOU MATHEMATICALLY

1613
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:35,400
WHY THIS IS
AERODYNAMICALLY IMPOSSIBLE.

1614
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:37,200
I DON'T CARE
ABOUT ALL THAT.

1615
01:18:37,200 --> 01:18:39,200
I JUST KNOW
YOU CAN DO IT.

1616
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:41,800
BUT GREAT MINDS
THROUGHOUT THE AGES

1617
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:43,600
HAVE TRIED TO SOLVE
THIS PROBLEM--

1618
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:46,800
ICARUS,
LEONARDO DA VINCI.

1619
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:50,000
AND NOW MERLIN JONES.

1620
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,200
THAT'S YOU, DEAR.

1621
01:18:52,200 --> 01:18:54,400
NO, MAN-POWERED FLIGHT'S
IMPOSSIBLE.

1622
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:56,200
NOTHING'S IMPOSSIBLE
FOR YOU.

1623
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:58,200
THIS IS.

1624
01:18:58,200 --> 01:19:00,400
JEN, I'VE GOT
TO FACE THE FACTS.

1625
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:02,800
I DESIGNED THE BEST POSSIBLE
FLYING MACHINE I COULD,

1626
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:04,400
BUT IT WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH.

1627
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:08,000
AND WHY WASN'T IT GOOD ENOUGH?
BECAUSE MAN ISN'T STRONG ENOUGH.

1628
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,400
THEN WHY DON'T YOU
MAKE MAN STRONGER.

1629
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:12,200
JEN.

1630
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:13,200
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
YOU'VE DONE IT AGAIN.

1631
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:15,400
YOU JUST PUT YOUR FINGER ON IT
WITH YOUR DUMB QUESTION.

1632
01:19:15,400 --> 01:19:17,800
ON WHAT?

1633
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:23,600
MERLIN!

1634
01:19:26,200 --> 01:19:27,800
MERLIN!

1635
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:29,400
MERLIN, I DIDN'T MEAN
TO HURT YOU.

1636
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:30,400
I WAS SCARED.

1637
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:32,400
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT I WAS DOING.

1638
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:34,800
YOU DID JUST
WHAT I WANTED YOU TO.

1639
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:38,200
YOU MEAN
YOU WANTED ME TO...
I FRIGHTENED YOU.

1640
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:40,800
AND THE FEAR SENT A SURGE OF
ADRENALINE INTO YOUR BLOODSTREAM

1641
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:43,000
THE ADRENALINE
MADE YOUR HEART BEAT FASTER

1642
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,200
AND RELEASED SUGAR
INTO YOUR CIRCULATORY SYSTEM,

1643
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:47,400
PROVIDING YOU
WITH A TEMPORARY SUPER ENERGY,

1644
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:48,800
A SUPERSTRENGTH.

1645
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:51,200
MERLIN, ARE YOU SURE
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT?

1646
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:52,800
I'M FINE.
DON'T YOU SEE, JEN?

1647
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,400
IF YOU DID THE SAME THING NOW
THAT THE MOMENT OF FEAR IS GONE,

1648
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:57,400
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE A FRACTION
OF THE POWER IN YOUR PUNCH.

1649
01:19:57,400 --> 01:19:59,000
YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE
TO HURT ME AT ALL.

1650
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
I DON'T WANT
TO HURT YOU.

1651
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:02,400
JEN, WILL YOU TRY
AND BE SCIENTIFIC FOR A MINUTE

1652
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:04,800
AND NOT JUST FEMININE?

1653
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:06,800
DON'T YOU SEE? ADRENALINE
IS THE ANSWER TO OUR PROBLEM,

1654
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:09,000
BECAUSE IT
MAKES MEN STRONGER.

1655
01:20:09,200 --> 01:20:11,200
REMEMBER WHEN I DID THIS?

1656
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:15,400
STOP THAT!

1657
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:17,000
LEAVE THAT GIRL ALONE!

1658
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:22,400
I TRUST, YOUNG LADY,
THAT BRUTE DIDN'T HURT YOU.

1659
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:24,800
YOU HURT HIM!

1660
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:34,400
YOU SEE, JEN?
ADRENALINE AGAIN!

1661
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:35,800
ANGER WORKS
THE SAME WAY AS FEAR,

1662
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:37,200
AND WITH ADRENALINE
IN YOUR BLOODSTREAM,

1663
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:39,400
YOU'RE AS STRONG
AS AN OVERGROWN GORILLA.

1664
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:42,000
MERLIN JONES.
I SHOULD'VE KNOWN.

1665
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,000
OH, BUT, MR. DEARBORNE--

1666
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:44,000
OH, I'M TERRIBLY SORRY.

1667
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,200
STAY AWAY FROM ME,
YOU FEMALE MONSTER, YOU.

1668
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:47,200
BUT, MISTER--

1669
01:20:47,200 --> 01:20:49,400
ONE STEP NEARER,
AND I SHALL YELL FOR THE POLICE.

1670
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:51,600
I JUST WANTED
TO EXPLAIN.
NO, NO!

1671
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:00,600
COME ON,
WE GOT WORK TO DO.

1672
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:06,000
WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO

1673
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,200
IS SYNTHESIZE
AN ADRENALINE DERIVATIVE

1674
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:10,600
THAT WON'T JUST GIVE A BURST
OF SUPERSTRENGTH,

1675
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:13,800
BUT WILL PRODUCE
A SUSTAINED SURGE OF POWER.

1676
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:16,600
BUT YOU'VE BEEN WORKING
ON THIS ALMOST ALL NIGHT.

1677
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:18,400
WOULDN'T BE EASIER
TO MAKE A PERSON ANGRY?

1678
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:19,800
BUT YOU COULDN'T KEEP
HIM ANGRY,

1679
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:21,400
ESPECIALLY AFTER
HE WERE AIRBORNE.

1680
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:24,000
NOW, THEN...

1681
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:27,400
LIQUID STRENGTH.

1682
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:29,200
NOW, LET'S SEE
IF IT WORKS.

1683
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:31,200
OH, NO! I'M NOT GOING
TO LET YOU TAKE IT.

1684
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:34,400
THAT'S STANLEY'S JOB,
ISN'T IT, STANLEY?

1685
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:39,200
YOU SEE?
HE LIKES IT.

1686
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:17,000
LOOK AT THAT.

1687
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:24,400
ISN'T THAT WONDERFUL?

1688
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:36,200
THAT'S QUITE ENOUGH, STANLEY.
YOU PROVED YOUR POINT.

1689
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:38,200
STANLEY!
PUT THAT DOWN AT ONCE!

1690
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:52,000
WELL, ANYWAY, THIS MEANS
THAT WITH LIQUID STRENGTH,

1691
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,400
MAN-POWERED FLIGHT
WILL WORK.

1692
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:55,000
I'LL CALL THE JUDGE
AND TELL HIM

1693
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:56,600
TO HAVE DARIUS GREEN
ON THE FIELD IN THE MORNING

1694
01:22:56,600 --> 01:22:58,200
AND TO MAKE SURE HE BRINGS
HIS CHECKBOOK WITH HIM.

1695
01:22:58,200 --> 01:23:00,600
BUT LEON QUIT.
WE DON'T NEED LEON.

1696
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:03,400
NOW THAT WE HAVE LIQUID
STRENGTH, I CAN DO IT MYSELF.

1697
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:06,000
OH, MERLIN,
YOU'RE WONDERFUL.

1698
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
I COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT
WITHOUT YOU.

1699
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,200
YOU ASKED THE MOST BRILLIANT
DUMB QUESTIONS

1700
01:23:10,200 --> 01:23:11,200
OF ANYONE I KNOW.

1701
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:14,000
OH, THAT'S THE NICEST THING
YOU'VE EVER SAID TO ME.

1702
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:15,400
JEN, YOU'RE
REALLY WONDERFUL.

1703
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:16,400
MERLIN!

1704
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:18,400
STANLEY, PUT ME DOWN.

1705
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:20,400
STANLEY,
YOU PUT MERLIN DOWN.
PUT ME DOWN.

1706
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:21,400
COME ON, NOW, PUT ME DOWN.

1707
01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:22,600
PUT HIM DOWN.
STANLEY.

1708
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:24,200
STANLEY, PUT HIM DOWN.
STANLEY, COME ON.

1709
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:26,000
STANLEY.
YOU PUT HIM DOWN
THIS MINUTE.

1710
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:27,400
STANLEY, PUT ME DOWN.

1711
01:23:27,400 --> 01:23:30,400
LET ME SAY, MR. GREEN,
HOW GRATEFUL WE ARE

1712
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:32,400
FOR YOUR
VERY GENEROUS OFFER.

1713
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:33,600
OH, NOTHING TO IT.

1714
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:35,600
THAT YOUNG FELLA THERE CAN CLEAR
MY GRANDDADDY'S NAME,

1715
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:37,200
WORTH EVERY PENNY
I HAVE IN THE WORLD.

1716
01:23:37,200 --> 01:23:38,600
WELL, COME AND SIT DOWN,
MR. GREEN.

1717
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:40,400
WE'RE ABOUT READY
TO START.

1718
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:41,200
HARDLY LOOKS LIKE A MAN

1719
01:23:41,200 --> 01:23:43,000
WITH MILLIONS OF DOLLARS
TO GIVE AWAY.

1720
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,200
CAN'T TELL A MAN'S WEALTH
BY HIS LOOKS,

1721
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:46,600
ONLY BY HIS BANK ACCOUNT.

1722
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:48,200
BUT LOOK
AT HIS CLOTHES.

1723
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:51,000
THAT'S THE WAY
THESE RICH ECCENTRICS ARE.

1724
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,200
THE MORE MONEY
THEY'VE GOT,

1725
01:23:52,200 --> 01:23:55,000
THE MORE DEPLORABLE
THEIR CLOTHES.

1726
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:56,200
HAVE A CIGAR.

1727
01:23:56,200 --> 01:23:57,600
THANKS.

1728
01:23:57,600 --> 01:23:59,200
SHALL WE GO AHEAD?

1729
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:01,600
YEAH.

1730
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:03,600
TAKE OFF WHEN READY!

1731
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:06,600
A-OKAY!

1732
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:08,600
GOOD LUCK, MERLIN.

1733
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:10,200
THANKS, JEN.

1734
01:24:10,400 --> 01:24:12,000
PLEASE BE CAREFUL.

1735
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:35,600
OFF WE GO.

1736
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:31,200
HE MADE IT!

1737
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:33,400
I SURE WISH MY GRANDDADDY
COULD SEE HIM NOW.

1738
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:44,200
LOOK OUT!

1739
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:47,000
LOOK AT THAT.
HE CAN STAY UP THERE FOR HOURS.

1740
01:25:56,200 --> 01:25:57,800
ISN'T HE WONDERFUL?

1741
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:05,200
I'M GETTING SO SURE
OF THAT YOUNG FELLA

1742
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:08,200
THAT I'M GONNA WRITE OUT
THIS CHECK RIGHT HERE AND NOW.

1743
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:10,200
OH, THERE'S NO HURRY,
BUT HERE'S THE PEN.

1744
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:14,200
WELL, I DON'T EXPECT
WE'LL NEED

1745
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:17,200
ASTERBILT'S SMALL CHANGE NOW,
RIGHT, GENTLEMEN?

1746
01:26:17,200 --> 01:26:18,600
QUITE RIGHT.
THAT'S THE END
OF ASTERBILT.

1747
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:21,400
AND WE CAN KEEP FOOTBALL
AT MIDVALE.

1748
01:26:21,400 --> 01:26:22,600
HERE YOU ARE, JUDGE.

1749
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:24,200
THANK YOU, MR. GREEN.

1750
01:26:25,200 --> 01:26:27,600
THIS IS NOT
FOR $10 MILLION.

1751
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:30,400
NO. HE'S DOING
SO WELL UP THERE,

1752
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:33,200
I THOUGHT
I'D UP THE ANTE.

1753
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:39,200
HE DOUBLED IT!

1754
01:26:39,400 --> 01:26:42,800
HE PUT $20 MILLION!

1755
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:05,400
$20 MILLION.

1756
01:27:05,400 --> 01:27:07,400
WHERE'S DEARBORNE?
I'D LIKE HIM TO SEE THAT CHECK.

1757
01:27:07,400 --> 01:27:08,600
HE SAID HE MIGHT BE
A LITTLE LATE,

1758
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:11,000
BUT THAT HE'D BE HERE.

1759
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,600
UH, YOU KNOW
SOMETHING, JUDGE?

1760
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:15,000
I NEVER THOUGHT
HE'D DO IT.

1761
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,800
I NEVER HAD ANY DOUBTS.
MERLIN'S A VERY BRILLIANT BOY.

1762
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:19,800
HE ALWAYS
SEEMED SHATTER-PATED TO ME.

1763
01:27:19,800 --> 01:27:21,200
SHATTER-PATED?

1764
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:22,800
TOUCHED,
ADDLED, MOONSTRUCK.

1765
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:25,400
WELL, I CAN UNDERSTAND HOW
HE MIGHT GIVE THAT IMPRESSION.

1766
01:27:25,400 --> 01:27:28,400
YOU SEE, HIS MIND
IS ALWAYS PREOCCUPIED

1767
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:30,200
WITH SCIENTIFIC PROBLEMS.

1768
01:27:30,200 --> 01:27:31,400
THAT BUNCH
OVER THERE--

1769
01:27:31,400 --> 01:27:33,600
THEY'RE ALL
SHATTER-PATED, TOO.

1770
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:35,400
WELL, THEY'RE
VERY EXCITED.

1771
01:27:35,400 --> 01:27:38,400
IT ISN'T EVERY DAY THAT THEY SEE
A CHECK FOR $20 MILLION.

1772
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:40,000
YOU KNOW
SOMETHING, JUDGE?

1773
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:43,200
I'VE BEEN LOOKING AT YOU,
AND I'VE COME TO THE CONCLUSION

1774
01:27:43,400 --> 01:27:44,600
YOU'RE SHATTER-PATED, TOO.

1775
01:27:44,600 --> 01:27:46,400
HELLO, HENRY.
WE FOUND YOU AGAIN.

1776
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:47,800
WALTER, TONY,

1777
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:48,800
THIS IS
JUDGE HOLMSBY.

1778
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:49,800
HI, JUDGE.

1779
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:51,800
WELL, COME ALONG,
HENRY.

1780
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:54,000
BUT, GENTLEMEN, YOU'RE MISTAKEN.
THIS IS MR. DARIUS GREEN.

1781
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,800
DARIUS GREEN?

1782
01:27:56,800 --> 01:27:58,400
ONCE HE WAS
ALEXANDER HAMILTON,

1783
01:27:58,400 --> 01:28:00,400
AND HE TRIED TO GIVE AWAY
THE UNITED STATES TREASURY.

1784
01:28:01,400 --> 01:28:03,400
DID HE OFFER YOU
ANY MONEY?

1785
01:28:03,400 --> 01:28:07,200
WELL, JUST--JUST $20 MILLION
FOR MIDVALE COLLEGE.

1786
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:08,800
WELL, HE MUST HAVE
LIKED YOU.

1787
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:10,800
HE ONLY OFFERED HARVARD
$5 MILLION.

1788
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,800
YOU MEAN THE WHOLE THING...

1789
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:17,000
HIS GENEROSITY
IS EQUALED ONLY BY HIS POVERTY.

1790
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
COME ALONG, HENRY.

1791
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:20,600
GOT TO HUMOR THEM, JUDGE.

1792
01:28:20,600 --> 01:28:22,800
THEY'RE NICE FELLOWS,
BUT THEY'RE BOTH SHATTER-PATED.

1793
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,200
GOOD TO SEE YOU, TONY.
HIYA, WALTER.

1794
01:28:29,400 --> 01:28:31,800
MERLIN!

1795
01:28:31,800 --> 01:28:34,400
MERLIN, IT'S ALL A MISTAKE!
THE DEAL'S OFF!

1796
01:28:34,600 --> 01:28:36,400
WHY?!
WHAT'S THE MATTER?!

1797
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:40,400
MR. DARIUS GREEN DOESN'T HAVE
ANY MILLIONS TO GIVE!

1798
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:42,000
HE'S SHATTER-PATED!

1799
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:45,000
WE'RE ALL OF US
SHATTER-PATED!

1800
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:48,400
OH, NO!

1801
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:50,000
OH, NO!

1802
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:53,400
MERLIN, BE CAREFUL!

1803
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:06,400
HENRY, HENRY!

1804
01:29:06,400 --> 01:29:07,600
COME BACK!

1805
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:22,400
OH, YEAH.

1806
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:24,800
MERLIN, ARE YOU SURE
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT?

1807
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:26,400
YEAH, YEAH,
I'M ALL RIGHT.

1808
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:28,600
WELL, JUDGE, THERE GOES FOOTBALL
AT MIDVALE.

1809
01:29:28,600 --> 01:29:32,400
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE
A MUD BATH?

1810
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:34,000
NOW, TAKE IT EASY, JUDGE.

1811
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
NO SENSE BEING
A BAD LOSER.

1812
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:41,400
WHY, MR. ASTERBILT,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

1813
01:29:41,400 --> 01:29:43,400
DELIGHTED TO SEE YOU,
DEARBORNE.

1814
01:29:43,400 --> 01:29:45,000
I'LL GIVE YOU THAT CHECK
RIGHT NOW.

1815
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:47,800
OH, MR. ASTERBILT, THAT'S
VERY KIND OF YOU, INDEED.

1816
01:29:47,800 --> 01:29:51,400
WELL, I HAVE TO GO ALONG
WITH THESE SHATTER-PATED FELLAS.

1817
01:29:51,400 --> 01:29:52,600
SO I'LL JUST SIGN THIS,

1818
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:55,600
AND YOU FILL IT IN NOW
FOR ANY AMOUNT YOU WANT.

1819
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:57,000
COME ALONG.

1820
01:29:57,000 --> 01:30:00,000
BYE, DEARBORNE.

1821
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:03,000
WHERE ARE THOSE MEN TAKING
MR. ASTERBILT?

1822
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:08,600
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH EVERYBODY?

1823
01:30:08,600 --> 01:30:10,400
MR. ASTERBILT
JUST GAVE ME A CHECK

1824
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:12,000
FOR ANY AMOUNT I CARE TO NAME.

1825
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
WELL, IF YOU'RE COLLECTING
HIS WORTHLESS CHECKS,

1826
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,200
HERE'S ONE
FOR $20 MILLION.

1827
01:30:18,200 --> 01:30:20,800
OH, YES.

1828
01:30:23,800 --> 01:30:25,600
OH, YES, HE...

1829
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:28,000
EASY COME, EASY...

1830
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:29,800
GO.

1831
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:36,800
COME BACK, HENRY!

1832
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:38,000
COME BACK!

1833
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:41,800
HI-OH, SILVER!

1834
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:43,200
AWAY!

1835
01:30:45,200 --> 01:30:48,000
OH, COME BACK!

1836
01:30:49,800 --> 01:30:49,800
COME BACK HERE, I SAY!
