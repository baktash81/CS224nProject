00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,966
<i>Buenos dias, Cecelio!</i>

2
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,884
Sir, I'm just saying, your ad says,
"Bad credit, no problem."

3
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,485
So can you define "no problem"?

4
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,001
Because me not getting this loan
is a problem.

5
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,322
I'm sorry. That's why I'm asking you to...

6
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,251
- Sorry, Daddy.
- That's okay, but that's just nasty.

7
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,725
No, no, no. Not you, sir.

8
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,930
Listen to this. What if I have everything
I need except the $30,000?

9
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,606
Keep calm? Sir. Sir. Can you...?

10
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,762
Ma'am. Okay. I couldn't tell.

11
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,804
Aren't you supposed to be a predatory lender?
Then prey on me!

12
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,724
Okay? You're a lion, I'm a gazelle.

13
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,850
Okay, fine. Fine. Do you know what?
I'm putting my daughter on the phone.

14
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,089
Explain to her why she has to go to
school in a gangbanger school district...

15
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,766
...where they're murdering kids. Murdering!

16
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,247
Here, you tell her.

17
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,890
Hey, baby, do what I showed you.

18
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,291
- Why do you want me to get murdered?
- No.

19
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,125
"Murdered.
Why do you want me to get murdered?"

20
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,207
They hung up.

21
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,806
Because you're
not doing what I told you to.

22
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,442
- You are sick.
- I'm not sick. It's called desperate.

23
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,085
Baby, all we have to do is keep saving.

24
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,766
I just need some love.
Can you just hug me?

25
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,251
Just kiss me?

26
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,044
- Any better?
- Awkward.

27
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,448
Come on.
Get your juice, and your book bag.

28
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,284
I told you to hit the bull's-eye.

29
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,084
How hard is it to cry, Makayla?

30
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,811
"Murder. Murder."

31
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,841
- Watch out.
- Move, old man.

32
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,844
Is that weed?

33
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,289
Hey, I want you to be safe, okay?

34
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,683
Listen to me. Listen to me.
You're not gonna be at this school forever.

35
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,808
Daddy's working on it. I love you.

36
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,849
- I love you too.
- All right.

37
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,083
- Don't worry.
- Kind of hard not to worry. You're my daughter.

38
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,963
- Come on, dear.
- Hey, watch it!

39
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,081
Matter of time. Matter of time.

40
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,250
- I kick, James!
- Yeah.

41
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,561
Move!

42
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,161
- Hey, babe!
- Watch this, honey.

43
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,367
Watch this.

44
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,763
Whoo! Look at that kick!

45
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,200
Good job, James!

46
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,963
Oh...

47
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:59,570
Good job, guys.
We're all working hard today. Mm.

48
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,846
Ah...

49
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,729
You looked good out there,
my big strong fiancé.

50
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:09,771
Jaoa says I need to focus on
bringing my power into the world.

51
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,291
Fuck!

52
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,883
Maybe I can help.

53
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,885
You...

54
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:22,806
...are a great man, James King.

55
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,450
Do me on the new house.

56
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,651
Did it get bigger?

57
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,883
Yeah, it did, baby.

58
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,964
It's the dick of a king. It's your scepter.

59
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,566
- No.
- Yeah.

60
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,125
No, I mean the house.

61
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,444
The king needs his castle, James.

62
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:00,045
Ten thousand square feet.

63
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,571
Seven bedrooms.

64
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,041
Two kitchens.

65
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,727
Infinity pool.

66
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,649
Is that a guesthouse for the guesthouse?

67
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,962
Well, in case our guests have guests.

68
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,926
And you have so many friends, baby.

69
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,969
Don't you, Mr. Popular?

70
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,207
So powerful.

71
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,051
So you don't think it's too much house,
do you?

72
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,725
James, seriously?

73
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,281
I mean, you wanna raise a family
in this house?

74
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,168
- Well, yes.
- In this...

75
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,720
...house?

76
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,086
No!

77
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,846
No, this house is a shithole!

78
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,601
Look...

79
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:52,089
...there's winners
and there's losers, James.

80
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,086
It's what drives this country.

81
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,891
All right? People look at what you have...

82
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,644
...and they want it.

83
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,447
They want your huge house.

84
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,926
And they want...

85
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,325
...your hot, hot...

86
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,801
...wife.
- So hot.

87
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,405
- Who's the king?
- I am.

88
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,767
Are you the king?
How much money you gonna make today?

89
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,605
- Enough to choke a baby.
- That's right.

90
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,491
- Yeah, are you a winner?
- Yes, I'm a winner.

91
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,689
- Whose tits are these?
- They're my tits.

92
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,927
These are the king's tits!

93
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,764
- The king's titties.
- That's right.

94
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:33,402
- Is it a king's dick?
- It's slightly above average.

95
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,291
Yeah? You gotta stake your claim, James.

96
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,602
Yes! You gotta stake it!

97
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,524
Stake my claim.

98
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,169
Oh, come on, baby. Do me like a billionaire!

99
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,007
You. You, right there, with the hat.

100
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,482
<i>I don't care</i>

101
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,569
Hey, boss man, did you get that text?

102
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,927
I sent you a text yesterday.

103
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,964
Surprise!

104
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,247
The boss is here.

105
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,006
Maybe it's time that we act
like we got work to do.

106
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:25,405
We got 40 cars and we got eight hours
of the air down here!

107
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,246
James King, Wealthrop Funds.

108
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,563
Transfer 100 million
from my client accounts.

109
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:35,964
I'd like to put a buy order
on Bradway Chemical, up to 7.50.

110
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,802
I've got a good feeling about clean coal.

111
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,240
Clean the roofs, Mike.

112
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:47,565
You don't think people can see those?
I hired you to do one thing.

113
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,047
That's be tall.

114
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,326
All right, great job.

115
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,443
Hey there, Jamesy,
that was quite a ride, man.

116
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,602
That was like third quarter 2012.

117
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,445
- It's a real pleasure to watch you work, sir.
- Thanks, Leo.

118
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,171
Yeah.
How about that, you knew my name!

119
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,689
I love it.

120
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,608
So I shorted gas and went long on coal.

121
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,843
It wasn't quite the return
I was hoping for, but...

122
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,161
James.

123
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,689
You made my company $28 million today.

124
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:24,686
Now, to celebrate, I would like to give you
an early wedding present...

125
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,331
- ...partner.
- Ah.

126
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,682
Sir, thank you.

127
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,121
Gayle, a minute.

128
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,844
James, this is the moment
when you cross that threshold...

129
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,486
...and join America's most elite.

130
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,530
Anything you desire,
anything you want is yours.

131
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,966
I'm ready for it.

132
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,968
You know, I bought an island
in Cape Verde.

133
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,124
An entire island.

134
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,000
You can too.

135
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:57,523
I would love to.
We could be island neighbors.

136
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,966
You could swim over
and borrow a cup of gold.

137
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,885
Yeah.

138
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,646
You know, and to think
it all started with this.

139
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,211
I still have that computer.

140
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,365
It reminds me
of my humble beginnings.

141
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,561
How I built this company
with my own two hands.

142
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,245
Just me, that computer...

143
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,841
...and an $8 million loan from my father.

144
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,684
You really did it all on your own.

145
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,485
Very inspiring, sir.

146
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,201
Now, listen, I want you to drop
this "sir" nonsense.

147
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,921
You are marrying my daughter,
for Pete's sake.

148
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,250
I want you to call me "Dad."

149
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,244
Really? Dad?

150
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,765
- Mm-hm.
- Heh.

151
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,843
That feels very good.

152
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,765
My real father never had time for me.

153
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:00,446
He shipped me off to boarding school in
London with the Murdochs and the bin Ladens.

154
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,764
Of course, that was before...

155
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,208
I mean, we knew they cheated in soccer,
but, had no idea...

156
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,407
...you know...

157
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,530
But if I could choose a dad...

158
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:16,128
Hey, you know something,
you're family now, kid.

159
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,165
Okay, then.

160
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,485
Oh, boy.

161
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,041
Motherfucker.

162
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,561
- Mr. King.
- Aah! Aah!

163
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,881
Take whatever you want!

164
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,286
- Please!
- It's the hood.

165
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,204
- Hey! It's Darnell.
- Help!

166
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,005
- Help! Help!
- Stop! Mr. King. No!

167
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,090
- Oh, dear Lord. Someone help me!
- Stop it! You're being ridiculous!

168
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,924
Stop! Look at me.

169
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,686
It's me.

170
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,765
I got your keys!

171
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,331
Oh.

172
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,482
Yes! I see you.

173
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,329
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

174
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,329
- Here you go.
- Oh.

175
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,324
- I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

176
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,641
And, uh, just so you know, I would have
done the same thing if you were white.

177
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,450
That's good to know.

178
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,126
Hey, Mr. King.

179
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,446
Um...

180
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,764
While I got you out here, I just wanna...
I just wanna talk to you for a second.

181
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,002
I've been washing your
car for two years now...

182
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,647
...and I can tell you're the type of man
who likes the best of everything.

183
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:40,170
So as owner and CEO
of Hollywood Luxury Bubbles...

184
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:45,042
...I wanted to offer you
an exclusive platinum lifetime wash card...

185
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,807
...for $30,000.

186
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,810
Now, before you say anything...

187
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:54,170
...think about the type of money
that you'll save with this investment.

188
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,766
Well, actually the time value
of money is such that...

189
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:00,288
...if I were to put that same amount
in my own fund...

190
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:05,049
...in 23 years' time,
I'd have in excess of $3 million.

191
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,247
Wow. Yeah.

192
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,768
With that rate of return, I could buy
a new car every time it gets dirty.

193
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,048
- Isn't that impressive?
- Amazing, Mr. King.

194
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,248
That's the magic of compounded interest.

195
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:17,967
You see, I didn't get to where I am today
by asking for handouts.

196
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,724
But by hard work.

197
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,441
And today, that hard work paid off...

198
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,127
...as I was just named partner
in my firm.

199
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,521
Mr. King, that is...

200
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,451
- Hey. That is amazing.
- Thank you so much.

201
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,207
- That is...
- Thank you.

202
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,563
That's amazing. Mr. King, listen to me.

203
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,127
I'm one of the hardest workers
you'll ever meet.

204
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:41,443
I mean, that's why I'm down here
power-washing cars every day.

205
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,001
I just felt with this face-to-face
that you would...

206
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,881
That you would wanna help
a fellow business owner and job creator.

207
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:52,011
I am helping you. By saying no.

208
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,647
- Mr. King, that's...
- That way, you can make it on your own.

209
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:59,691
Okay. Mr. King, I have a lot of people
helping me that way already. And... And...

210
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:03,447
Great. Then you have a plan for success.

211
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,965
Why didn't you tell me that?

212
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:09,927
You see, everyone,
whether we're born rich or poor...

213
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,606
...or white...

214
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,922
...or miscellaneous...

215
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,730
...who we become...

216
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,565
...is based on our own decisions.
It's simple as that.

217
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,206
You know who else started in a garage?

218
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,648
Hewlett-Packard. So you're in good company.

219
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,647
- And on that note...
- No, Mister...

220
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,929
- You don't have to give me that much, Mr. King.
- Hold on, hold on.

221
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:34,204
- You don't have to give me that much.
- Hold on. There we go.

222
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,771
You really don't need...

223
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,126
There you go.

224
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,361
There's a start.

225
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,844
Mr. King, please.
I feel like you just haven't given me...

226
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,043
Success is a mindset!

227
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,521
Hi, everyone!

228
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,966
Hi.

229
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:14,808
Thank you so much
for celebrating our engagement with us.

230
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,047
Excuse me.

231
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,841
Excuse me.

232
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,968
Excuse me. Everyone, just "shh."

233
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,288
Shh! You need to "shh." Senator.

234
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,645
Shh! Shh.

235
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,961
Yellow tie.

236
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,164
I see you.

237
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,961
Thank you.

238
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,125
James, I love you...

239
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,567
...and I can't wait to be married to you.

240
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,963
Aw.

241
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:44,569
And because you rock my world...

242
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,240
...I got you this!

243
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,165
Oh!

244
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,522
Hey! Wow.

245
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,245
This is beautiful.

246
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,486
- But not as beautiful as you, Alissa.
- Aw.

247
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,881
- I love you.
- I love you.

248
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:07,010
Being with you and in front
of all of our friends and family here...

249
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:11,051
...I just wanna say,
I'm the luckiest man in the world!

250
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,406
Play something!

251
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,925
- Oh.
- Oh, oh.

252
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,765
Well, actually, there's one more part
to your present!

253
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,083
It's Mr. John Mayer!

254
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,408
- John Mayer!
- Thank you, thank you.

255
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,246
Hey, everybody!

256
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,210
Who's John Mayer?

257
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,604
I just wanna say, thank you,
James and Alissa, for making me...

258
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,171
Shut up!

259
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,408
...a part of your special night.
Thank you very much.

260
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,325
I wanna thank you personally
for the Bradway Chemical buy.

261
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,241
- Oh, sure. Ha-ha-ha.
- There's nothing I love more than making money.

262
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:44,881
Not even chicks. Or dudes. I fuck anything.

263
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,164
You ever seen 100 women get wet
at the same time? Watch this.

264
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,249
Aw.

265
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:01,324
<i>Fathers, be good to your daughters</i>

266
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:05,202
<i>Daughters will love like you do</i>

267
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,441
<i>Girls become lovers</i>

268
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,848
<i>Who turn into mothers</i>

269
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:19,563
<i>So, mothers
Be good to your daughters too</i>

270
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,688
John, lay back.
I'm gonna take a few bars.

271
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,887
Yeah.

272
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,846
Hey! Step aside, FBI! Back up!

273
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,402
Everybody, step aside!

274
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,365
- James King.
- Yeah?

275
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:43,922
You're under arrest for 43 counts
of fraud and 30 counts of embezzlement.

276
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,129
- That's impossible.
- That's what they all say. Get him out of here!

277
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,169
I know. This is some kind of joke.

278
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:52,403
Because if this isn't,
this is the worst nightmare imaginable.

279
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,971
Yeah! Ha-ha-ha. Finally.

280
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,964
- Are you getting this?
- Shit, yeah! Get out of the way!

281
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,329
- I swear I don't know what any of this is about!
- Mm-hm.

282
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,327
Don't worry, son! I'll take care of it.

283
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,811
Let's go.

284
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,681
- Gayle, call my lawyer.
- My party!

285
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,286
Looks like you could use
a friend right now.

286
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,204
What the fuck?

287
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,967
The charges are securities fraud
and embezzlement.

288
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:28,284
- These transaction records prove you're guilty.
- I've never seen these. These are fakes!

289
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,484
If you go to court,
they're gonna kick your ass. Take the plea.

290
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,091
- Dad!
- Take the plea.

291
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,050
You'll be out in a year
and in the best shape of your life.

292
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:40,046
No. I have faith that the justice system
will exonerate me.

293
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,562
And that the jury will put aside
their bias and see the truth:

294
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,007
That I didn't steal money from people.

295
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,202
And that I am no Bernie Madoff.

296
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:52,046
A verdict is expected today
in the "mini-Madoff" trial of James King.

297
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,124
I lost everything! Fuck you!

298
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,770
I didn't do it!

299
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:07,243
For too long,
wealthy white-collar offenders like you...

300
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,206
...have gotten a free pass with light
sentences in minimum-security prison...

301
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,887
...while working Americans have suffered.
Well, that ends today, Mr. King.

302
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:18,203
I sentence you
to the harshest penalty allowed:

303
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,528
Ten years in a maximum-security prison.

304
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,726
You have 30 days
to get your affairs in order.

305
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,089
Just run them over!

306
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,083
I can't go to jail. I'll die in there.

307
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:34,562
That's not gonna happen, James,
because I'm gonna put my investigators...

308
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,042
...on this twenty-four-seven
until we find out who really did this.

309
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,123
Just stay in county lines
with that thing on.

310
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,886
Otherwise, the U.S. Marshals
will be down there pronto.

311
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:46,522
Son, I want you to stay strong.
Do you hear me?

312
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,211
I will.

313
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,448
I'll be so strong for you, Dad.

314
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,211
Why me?

315
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,288
I have to leave the country!

316
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:37,050
It took so long to ring me up, I had to miss
my waxing appointment. I feel like a gorilla.

317
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,611
It's summer too.

318
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,445
I can't believe this is happening to me.

319
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,365
- It's like they don't recognize you anymore.
- Thank you. Yes.

320
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,567
Alissa!

321
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,768
Hey! It's me, James.

322
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,882
I know. What are you doing?

323
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,611
Why do you look like that?

324
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:55,081
Just eat your fucking salads.

325
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,641
I'll fucking kill you if you say anything.

326
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,131
Hi.

327
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,124
- Hi. Hi.
- Hi.

328
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,611
I came up with a great idea.

329
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:06,321
Let's just run away! Some place
that no one would ever think to find us.

330
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,130
Mexico.

331
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,770
Let's just leave this
material world behind.

332
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,082
Live in a one-bedroom shack.

333
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,969
- Oh, God.
- Yes.

334
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,926
- You could sell Chiclets on the road.
- What?

335
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,687
Look, we'll work out the details later.

336
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,330
- We should get out of here.
- No!

337
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,370
- I already cut off my ankle bracelet.
- No! No.

338
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,567
Let's go.

339
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,801
- James, no.
- What?

340
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,485
- No! I'm leaving you.
- Why?

341
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,329
But I thought you loved me forever.

342
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,326
Well, now you know.

343
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,321
Alissa.

344
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,807
<i>This is the U.S. Marshal Service.</i>

345
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:49,646
<i>James King, exit the building
and surrender to custody immediately.</i>

346
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,887
Oh, shit!

347
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,851
Hey, guys. He's in there.

348
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,885
Why are you arresting me?

349
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,967
I am but a simple bartender from Belize.

350
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,167
Wait, no. Mexico.

351
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,568
Call my lawyer in Tijuana.

352
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,844
Shit!

353
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,680
- What the fuck is that?! Get off!
- It's me! It's me!

354
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,211
- Mr. King?
- Yes.

355
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,842
You scared the shit out of me, man.

356
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,726
What you doing in the trunk?

357
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,167
I just needed a place to regroup.

358
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,527
You know, fresh start.

359
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,370
Okay. Hey. Let me help you out, man.

360
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,805
Fuck you, King!

361
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,691
- I lost everything because of you!
- I didn't do it!

362
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,640
Fuck!

363
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,211
Fuck someone!

364
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,885
Fuck a tit!

365
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,050
Fuck a tit hard!

366
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,322
For the love of Alan Greenspan.

367
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,724
Fuck! My life is ruined.

368
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:03,922
I venture you've heard
that I'm going to prison.

369
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:08,446
Yeah. No, we all did. I just didn't
wanna bring it up first, that's all.

370
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,126
Come on. They're probably sending you
to some Club Fed prison.

371
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,522
You'll be playing tennis and golf, you know.

372
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:18,971
- I'm going to be attending San Quentin.
- They're sending you to San Quentin?

373
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,367
Oh.

374
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,210
- What?
- Oh, God!

375
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,800
They fucking in San Quentin.

376
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,487
- Oh.
- Everybody gets the dick.

377
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,045
I don't want it.

378
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,409
You're not gonna get it.
You'll be in for three months.

379
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,968
I'm gonna be there for 10 years.

380
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,885
Goddamn! Ten years?

381
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,930
- Oh! Oh!
- Why do you say it like that?

382
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,162
It's not as bad as I've heard, is it?

383
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:45,490
If you heard everybody fucking, it is.
That's how bad it is.

384
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,005
I didn't hear that part.

385
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,368
They might as well call it
San Fucking, man.

386
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,249
I don't wish that on my worst enemy.
You talking about bad? That's bad.

387
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,490
You should know.

388
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,490
I'm sorry to remind you.

389
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,648
What are you talking about?

390
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,882
Well, the fact that you went to prison.

391
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,884
The fact that I went to prison?

392
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,526
Yes. Look, you did your time.

393
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:12,730
You paid your debt. And we as society...

394
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,121
...should welcome you back, and we do.

395
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,928
You and I are exactly the same.

396
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,128
Except you can't vote, ever.

397
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,687
Just before I get to another level of anger,
Mr. King, tell me for giggles...

398
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,920
- ...how do you know I went to prison?
- It's simple.

399
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,560
Statistical analysis is what I do.
Here's the deal:

400
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:33,566
One out of three black men will find
themselves incarcerated during their lifetime.

401
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,489
- Imagine a pizza, okay?
- Okay.

402
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,880
There are three pieces.

403
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,966
Three black pieces.

404
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:46,851
One of those pieces of pizza will be thrown
in jail at some point during it's life.

405
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,126
You know what?
Let me give you my statistical analysis.

406
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,806
You going to San Quentin.
There's 100 percent chance...

407
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,691
...that you're gonna be somebody's bitch.
Ten years of this:

408
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,800
- You know what that is?
- Mm-mm.

409
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,683
A big-ass black man
on your pale white ass.

410
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:08,083
You: "No! I don't want any more!
Stop! That's enough."

411
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:11,011
Too late. He done tagged the next guy in.

412
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,882
That's like a rabbit.
You don't want him no more...

413
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,407
...so now here comes the guy
that wants to rub your face.

414
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,722
"I like his hair." He's breathing on you.

415
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,123
That's disgusting. But guess what?
You can look forward to 10 years of it!

416
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,760
What if I speak to all the bitches
and we organize...

417
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,730
...form a union, and we put our feet down
and say, "Enough!"

418
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:30,247
- There's gotta be more of us than them.
- There's not.

419
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:34,161
You deserve everything you're getting.
Good luck on survival, sir.

420
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,806
Better luck on handling yourself!

421
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:40,522
Wait! Wait! Wait! Don't leave.
Don't leave, please. I could use your help.

422
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,727
Help you with what?

423
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,361
Help me to not be someone's bitch.

424
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:50,047
You expect me to help you?
I'm supposed to teach you what?

425
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,406
How to prevent this:

426
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,965
- All right, stop.
- You could train me.

427
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:59,044
You could be the Athena to my Odysseus.

428
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,328
I don't even know
what the fuck that is, man!

429
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,320
I could pay you.

430
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,365
Whatever it takes.

431
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,130
I need $30,000.

432
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,409
- Done.
- Oh...

433
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,840
Okay.

434
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,965
Yup. Yeah.

435
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,481
- Fantastic.
- All right.

436
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,080
What are you doing?

437
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,645
I only know these two.

438
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,770
What are you trying to do?

439
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,810
- Shake? You wanna shake my hand?
- Oh, regular.

440
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,962
- It's a deal. We got a deal.
- Excellent.

441
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,811
- Thank you, Darnell.
- I'll see you in the morning, convict.

442
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,490
What are you doing? What is that?

443
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,005
- Trying to do this thing.
- No.

444
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,969
- Shake. It's fine.
- Okay.

445
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,248
Mr. King, no. I got that.

446
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,642
- All right. No problem.
- I appreciate it.

447
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,001
I appreciate it.

448
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,411
Oh.

449
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:50,287
Yes! Thank you!

450
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,050
Thank you, Jesus!

451
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,647
I knew it! I knew my day would come.

452
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,484
I'm getting the house.

453
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:01,361
I'm getting the house. Unh!

454
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:07,769
Babe. This does not make any sense.

455
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,445
Why would he hire you?

456
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,968
- Because he thinks I went to prison, babe.
- That's the part I don't get.

457
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,771
- Why would you tell him that?
- I didn't. He assumed that.

458
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:16,961
- He assumed it?
- Yes!

459
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,124
So what reason did you give him
to assume that you went to jail?

460
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,441
I was being black.

461
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:26,284
- This is nuts.
- Okay. I don't get what's nuts to you.

462
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:30,126
In 30 days, we'll have the money, the house
will be ours. What is the problem?

463
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:34,080
The problem is he is never going to believe
that you went to jail.

464
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:37,682
Look, babe. I am your wife,
so I will put it to you straight.

465
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,003
You are not exactly a thug.

466
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,931
I don't have to be a thug to portray a thug.
Okay?

467
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:47,651
Honestly, all I gotta do is change my voice,
talk a little deeper.

468
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:51,122
Talk like this and be
every stereotype he already thinks I am.

469
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,851
Right now, I'm thugging.
This is thugging.

470
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,486
You're so good at it, sweetie.

471
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,650
Have a good night.

472
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,883
- Bitch! Don't walk away from me!
- What the hell did you just say to me?

473
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,520
- Girl, stop. Stop!
- What is wrong with you?

474
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:09,002
What is that?
I love you! I was playing!

475
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,168
- Bitch.
- What?

476
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,129
- I didn't say nothing!
- Oh.

477
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,123
Man, I didn't say nothing.

478
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,444
You wanna watch <i>The Notebook?</i>

479
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,685
- I love you and Makayla.
- Yeah, I love you too. Good night.

480
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:29,047
<i>You've reached the mailbox of Martin Clark.</i>

481
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,208
<i>Please leave a message after the tone.</i>

482
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,851
Hi, Dad?

483
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,690
It's James.

484
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:38,208
Just wondering if there's any word
from the investigators.

485
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,045
I still love you.

486
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,530
Thank you. Bye.

487
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:47,886
<i>Now, I heard a crazy story about you.
This guy James King?</i>

488
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:52,682
<i>And I heard that you played at the party
where he got arrested.</i>

489
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:56,049
<i>Yeah. I had no idea
that I was performing for a monster.</i>

490
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:59,568
<i>I don't know how to explain what it's like
to take money from someone like that.</i>

491
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,563
<i>It makes you wanna give it back to them...</i>

492
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:04,405
<i>...except that would be worse
because then they'd have it.</i>

493
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:09,569
<i>And it's that whole helpless feeling that I have
about our creative process being monetized...</i>

494
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,610
<i>...and that's what inspired me
to write this song...</i>

495
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,286
<i>...which is actually available
on iTunes tonight at midnight.</i>

496
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,608
<i>- If I can play it.
- Great.</i>

497
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:21,490
<i>I can't see through walls</i>

498
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,131
<i>And I can't read your mind</i>

499
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,961
<i>But if I did I'd find</i>

500
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,886
<i>That man James King is a great big turd</i>

501
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:36,803
<i>I mean the small, small kinds</i>

502
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,488
<i>But that **** James</i>

503
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,531
<i>Will fall
Hands against the prison wall</i>

504
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:45,604
<i>Choking on a mouthful of balls</i>

505
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,241
<i>He'll be choking on
A mouthful of balls</i>

506
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,323
I hate to admit it, but it's a good song.

507
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,324
<i>Okay, very nice. John Mayer, everybody.</i>

508
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:56,165
Now I'm gonna be dreaming about balls.

509
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,805
Hey, Russell.

510
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,809
It's Darnell.

511
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,442
Your cousin. Your cousin, Darnell, man.

512
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,761
Hey, listen, Russell...

513
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,487
...how would you like to make $500
just for telling me what prison was like.

514
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:13,727
Well, I don't wanna say that.
Russell, I shouldn't have to say that.

515
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,970
For what?! What is...?

516
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,451
Fine. Fine.

517
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:20,211
I'm a Cliff Huxtable pussy-looking
motherfucker.

518
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,651
No! I'm not even wearing khakis.

519
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:29,722
Russell, can you please just help me, what I'm
asking you for? Just start from the beginning.

520
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:34,010
No, no. Like, the beginning, the beginning.
Like, the first day of prison.

521
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,251
On the first day?

522
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,046
Oh. There's no warm-up?

523
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:41,887
That's sad.

524
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,648
Russell, I'm sorry,
did I just hear a gunshot?

525
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,167
You gotta go. Okay. Bye.

526
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:57,887
Ready, mother...?

527
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,565
Ready, mother...? Ready, mother...?

528
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:02,326
That's it, that's it. Ahem.

529
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,411
Coming!

530
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:11,361
Rita, Makayla, new house, good school.

531
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,681
You ready, motherfucker?

532
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,524
Just a second!

533
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,730
Hello?

534
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,723
- You ready, motherfucker?!
- Aah!

535
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,246
- Oh, it burns!
- Pepper spray, bitch!

536
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,887
Rule number one:
You always be on guard, okay?

537
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,520
On the inside, there's somebody
on every corner to fuck you up!

538
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,929
Prison school is in session, bitch!
You already failing.

539
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:42,483
I'm so glad I hired you.
This is just what I need.

540
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,927
Okay. What's next?

541
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:47,560
What the...?!
How many motherfuckers live here?!

542
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:50,690
All right. Let's get started.

543
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,487
This right here is
my prison readiness program.

544
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:57,531
If you follow this guide and do exactly
what I say you will survive in prison.

545
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,406
"Keistering."

546
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:04,804
- What's keistering?
- Slow down! You ain't ready for that.

547
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,081
You're the teacher.

548
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:10,962
And I just want you to know I'll do whatever
it takes to survive and get my life back.

549
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,963
That's good,
because let me tell you something:

550
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,520
You're gonna have to work harder
than you ever worked before.

551
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:20,641
Back when I was in Harvard Business School,
I was facing some pretty long odds.

552
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,041
But I buckled down and I succeeded.

553
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,851
When you was at Harvard,
did you ever get raped for failing a test?

554
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,809
I think that's more of a Yale thing.

555
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,371
- "Yale."
- I'm sorry.

556
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,764
Shut the fuck up!

557
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:44,000
Now from this point on,
this ain't your house no more.

558
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:47,369
- This San Quentin! You understand me?
- Okay.

559
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,529
From now on this will be your cell.

560
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:52,485
You do not leave this room
without my permission.

561
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,485
It's good.

562
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:00,004
- For you to sleep on, <i>señor.</i>
- Go on, we ain't got time for games.

563
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,810
Go upstairs,
turn this place into prison.

564
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:05,442
It will be our pleasure to repay you
for your many kindnesses.

565
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:11,011
Put that in there in front of the statues
with the dicks.

566
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,811
James, listen to me.

567
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,169
The key to survival in prison lies
in the following simple questions:

568
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,442
Are you hard?
And can you handle yourself?

569
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:23,243
Well, this is a rare moment for optimism because
the answer to that is a resounding yes.

570
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:26,165
That's good. Let me see
what your mad-dog face look like.

571
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,841
- I'm sorry. What's a mad dog?
- You a mad dog!

572
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,963
- Oh, shit.
- What's your what, nigga?

573
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:33,361
- Take whatever you want!
- Let me see that!

574
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,045
No!

575
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,005
- Stop! I beg of you!
- Like a pit bull with no leash.

576
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,045
That's a mad dog.

577
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,362
Wow. I knew you were the right guy
for the job.

578
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:50,884
In prison, a mad-dog face is essential to
your survival. Do you understand me, James?

579
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:55,682
So the idea is that I make a face that conveys
the fact that I'd have no problem hurting you.

580
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,731
Exactly what it is.
Now, convey that shit. Let me see it.

581
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,486
Okay. Ahem.

582
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,124
Ha!

583
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,644
- That's terrible.
- Ha, ha.

584
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,690
No, that's horrible, man. Anger.
You gotta show me anger.

585
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:13,242
- Why you smiling?
- I'm not smiling. I'm tense and I'm agitated.

586
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,765
Come on, man!

587
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,889
- Unh!
- That's your mad... That's it?!

588
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,441
- Your fiancée left you.
- That's right!

589
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,409
- You happy about that?
- No.

590
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:24,086
Then get mad! She gonna leave you?
What is she doing?

591
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,926
She probably on her knees sucking
somebody dick in the back seat of a truck.

592
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,847
Show...

593
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:31,967
James.

594
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:35,524
Oh. Oh. Come on. Come on.

595
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:38,803
- I miss her so much.
- What the fuck are you doing, James?

596
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,771
I'm sad-dogging you.

597
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:46,210
- James?
- You think that's a strategy that could work?

598
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,931
No. I don't think it's a strategy
that could work.

599
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,771
Hey, listen up, everyone.
I'm extremely sad.

600
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,325
Please don't sexually assault me.
I'm already too sad.

601
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:58,245
Hey, fellas. My heart's already been raped.

602
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,721
I don't wanna do this anymore.
Let's move on. Okay?

603
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,043
We're moving on from the mad dog.
James, can you fight?

604
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,491
Absolutely.

605
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,561
What?

606
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,762
You had to change your clothes for this?

607
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,969
What the fuck are you doing, man?

608
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:19,168
It's called capoeira.

609
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,890
It's a Brazilian martial art.

610
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,361
But don't be fooled
by its beauty and grace.

611
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:26,006
It's actually quite deadly.

612
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,645
This is deadly?

613
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,080
That's deadly?

614
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,527
- Stab.
- Ow.

615
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,006
- Stab.
- Stop.

616
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:35,640
- Stab. Stab.
- Guards! Guards!

617
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,162
- Stabbity-stab, stab, stab!
- Ow. Ow!

618
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,322
The fuck are you doing, man?

619
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,847
Shit ain't gonna save you in San Quentin!

620
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,890
Well, that may not,
but you haven't seen my <i>Bênção</i> kick.

621
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,168
- Your what?!
- My <i>Bênção</i> kick.

622
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,524
Look what your dumb ass done did. Stab.

623
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:59,890
- Stab.
- I'm dead.

624
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,008
Stab, stab, stab, stab.

625
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,090
You're so bad.

626
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:11,128
James. I gotta tell ya. I just can't
imagine what you must be going through.

627
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,682
It is so nice to talk to you.

628
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,926
<i>What's the latest from the investigators?</i>
The investigators?

629
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:21,046
- Chinese hackers. They're pretty sure.
- Hey!

630
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:24,640
I know I'm not crazy. Didn't I tell you
to get off the phone? Get off the phone.

631
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,724
- Hey, who are you talking to?
- It's Darnell. He's helping me.

632
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,086
Your time is up!

633
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,288
- I gotta go. I'll call you back.
- Hang it up!

634
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,204
- If I get more phone time.
- Hang it up!

635
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,725
That was important to me!

636
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,201
When you got a line of inmates
waiting to use the phone...

637
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,767
...you do not wanna piss them off, James.

638
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,889
I'm going to fuck you up, Mr. James!

639
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,201
Rosa!

640
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,244
You watch your back on the yard.

641
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,728
I'm not a <i>puto.</i>

642
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,480
Great.

643
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,968
- All right. We got a problem.
- What's that?

644
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,929
James is talking to somebody.

645
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,241
No, no, he trusts you.

646
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,165
- He'll never put two and two together.
- No, stop it!

647
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,924
- This is your fault!
- What?

648
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,321
Well, you couldn't get him
to take the plea deal.

649
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:12,407
Instead of him going to prison, you got him
30 days to be out there, running around...

650
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,601
...fucking things up!

651
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:18,163
I had to make it look good. You throw a fight,
you don't go down in the first round. It's fine.

652
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:22,121
I don't want him out there,
playing detective with somebody.

653
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,686
You keep an eye on my
ex-future son-in-law, would ya?

654
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:29,202
- And find out who this Darnell is.
- I'm on it. Right away.

655
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,925
There you go.

656
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:37,282
All right, James. Look, you're gonna
get in a fight on the inside. Okay?

657
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,091
You don't need to win,
but you need to show these guys...

658
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:44,802
...that you're not afraid to fight back. Get
used to fighting. See those guys over there?

659
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:49,843
- Yes.
- Go over there and fight one of them.

660
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,970
That's insane!

661
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:56,566
They're behemoths.
They would break my spine.

662
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,371
Those are the type of guys
you're gonna see in San Quentin.

663
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:04,122
So you gotta shake that fear. I want you to
go and punch that big-ass dude in the mouth.

664
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,329
Oh, my God. My heart is pounding.

665
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,445
Okay.

666
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,685
Hey, guys.

667
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,005
Who the fuck are you, man?

668
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,644
I wanna fight you.

669
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,367
What?

670
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:35,491
You picked the wrong day
to come to the park.

671
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:40,688
- Is this some kind of joke, man?
- You ever been mad-dogged before?

672
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,527
You about to get some right now,
motherfucker.

673
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,768
What the fuck is that, man?

674
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,729
It's the size of your dick.

675
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,601
I'm gonna break it off, make you eat it.

676
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,766
You fuck your mother with that dick?

677
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,883
How do you know my mama?!
You don't know my mama.

678
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,806
Oh, no.

679
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:06,045
- Aah! Aah! Aah!
- Come on! Get him! Get him!

680
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,691
Get back here, bitch!

681
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:11,726
Oh, no! Please don't hurt my body! Aah!

682
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,689
No! My body!

683
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,486
Help me!

684
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,722
You're breaking my spine!

685
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,365
What happened to my tennis court?

686
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:37,208
You will no longer refer to this area as a tennis
court. From this point on, this is the yard.

687
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:41,001
Understand something, James.
The yard is the most deadliest part of prison.

688
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:45,206
It's where you get your few precious minutes
of fresh air and sunlight. Understand?

689
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,964
Fresh air.

690
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:51,529
How many times did I breathe in clean air,
fragrant with lavender, and take it for granted?

691
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:54,684
James, I don't give a fuck how many times.
I don't give a shit.

692
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,729
- I'm just saying.
- Shut up, James.

693
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,804
You gotta step carefully because
if you step in the wrong place...

694
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:03,200
...you'll end up in the wrong territory.
For a person like you that can't fight...

695
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:06,290
...it's not a good thing, James.
It's not a good thing at all.

696
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:10,047
Right now, you in the brothers-only section.
You got two seconds to get out.

697
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,282
- Before you get mollywhopped.
- Okay, Darnell.

698
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,646
- Who's Darnell?!
- You are.

699
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:14,961
My name is Leroy!

700
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:18,283
- Yeah, I suggest you walk, white boy. Walk!
- All right. I'm walking.

701
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,249
- Turn around and walk!
- I'm walking.

702
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,760
- Hey, <i>ése.</i>
- What?

703
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,565
- You got a problem, <i>gringo?</i>
- Darnell, what are you doing?

704
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:29,167
Darnell? Who's Darnell, <i>ése?</i>
You're looking at Carlos.

705
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:32,244
I suggest you walk wherever you came
from, <i>ése,</i> before you have a problem.

706
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,720
- I was trying to leave that area.
- You need to go back...

707
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,928
- ...over there with the <i>negros, ése.</i>
- With Leroy?

708
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,970
You go back over there with the <i>negros!</i>
That's where you belong.

709
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:42,202
- I don't see anyone.
- You belong with the <i>Negros.</i>

710
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,521
- Go.
- I'm going.

711
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,280
- Fuck you calling a negro?!
- He was. I wasn't.

712
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:49,051
I told you, Carlos!
Keep that shit over there on your side!

713
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,328
- Take the Yankee with you!
- I'll go with you!

714
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,403
Hey, I don't want him.

715
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:55,244
He's a <i>negro</i> lover. You take him.

716
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,801
Motherfucker! Say something else, bro!

717
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:01,282
Hey! Hey, I swear to God.
I swear to God, I'll cut you,<i>ése.</i>

718
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,171
- Let's just shake hands.
- There is no shaking hands, <i>gringo.</i>

719
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,920
- Friendship.
- Go back where you belong.

720
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,240
I don't know where I belong.

721
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:10,165
Leave him alone. I'll keep him.

722
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,484
You belong with me.

723
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,650
- Who are you?
- I'm Dante.

724
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:18,089
Why don't you leave him alone, Carlos!
Leave him alone, Leroy!

725
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,527
- Are you a woman?
- I am if you want me to be.

726
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:21,967
I don't want that.

727
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,561
- Okay, I know what you are.
- Let me hold your pocket.

728
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,688
- Let me hold your pocket.
- All right.

729
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,163
I claimed him! He mine, Leroy!

730
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:33,722
Bitch, you got two seconds
to let his fucking pocket go. Two!

731
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:36,167
- Motherfucker! You got two seconds!
- Don't hit a woman!

732
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:38,240
- Gonna knock your ass out!
- Don't hit a woman!

733
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,606
You don't want my pocket.

734
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,331
You don't want it. So what?
Why can't I be happy?

735
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:47,330
Hey, <i>ése.</i> I don't like you
and this domestic shit in front of my crew.

736
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,527
You think I like it?

737
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:51,160
You need to fucking take it
somewhere else, <i>ése,</i> huh?

738
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:53,360
<i>Gringo,</i> you take you
and your dirty bitch elsewhere.

739
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:56,086
- I'll go over there.
- Don't call me dirty.

740
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,130
I wasn't dirty when you was up in it.
I wasn't dirty then, was I?

741
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:02,161
You were dirty then. You're dirty now.

742
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:05,364
- He ain't complaining.
- You should get tested.

743
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:09,361
No, I'm not complaining because
we have yet to have any sort of interaction.

744
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:11,760
- Tonight will be our night.
- No. Tonight won't happen.

745
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:14,080
- Be my white knight. Save me.
- Don't get your hopes up.

746
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:16,168
Let me ride you.
Let me ride you into safety.

747
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:20,729
No! I don't feel comfortable with that.
Let go of me! Leroy is going to be upset.

748
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,806
- I knew you were coming back.
- Motherfucker!

749
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:25,405
I knew you were coming back.

750
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:27,483
You making me mad, motherfucker!

751
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:30,440
- I'm not doing anything!
- I'm about to whoop your ass, white boy!

752
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:33,570
- I'm just standing here.
- No, you not. You got my bitch!

753
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:35,880
- Trying to figure out a place...
- I'm your old bitch.

754
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,047
We're like zebras.

755
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,965
- We're not like a zebra.
- We are like a zebra. You're my...

756
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:44,205
Somehow you're getting me to hug you,
and I don't know how that's happening.

757
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:49,042
That's it! That's it, <i>gringo.</i>
I swear, I'm getting sick of this shit. I'll stab you.

758
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:52,687
I'm still confused as to what piece
you are in this puzzle, Carlos.

759
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,651
Hold on! Hold on. Question, question.

760
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,325
Are there any French gangs?

761
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:00,522
I speak French. I'm not fluent, but I can...

762
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:06,888
Can I join the gang, <i>s'il vous plaît?</i>

763
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:10,520
You know what?
You can't fight. Since you can't fight...

764
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:13,962
...I'm left with one choice,
and that's to get your stupid ass in shape.

765
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:16,248
God! You're failing.

766
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,880
I've got a state-of-the-art gym
40 feet away.

767
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:21,644
Ain't no gyms in San Quentin.

768
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,202
Curl me, bitch! Curl me!

769
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:28,451
Maybe I should start with a baby
at higher reps.

770
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:31,848
Hey! Hey, you!

771
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,802
- I wanna fight you.
- What'd you say, dickhead?

772
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,489
I wanna fight you, asshole.

773
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,569
Let's just rest here.

774
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:46,889
Look at his face. He looks like
he's getting fucked right now.

775
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:49,810
Come on!

776
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:52,247
You better not drop me! Goddamn it!

777
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:55,486
Excuse me, sir. I hate to bother you,
but I need to fight you.

778
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:56,801
I was in Nam!

779
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:59,362
And I fucking loved it!

780
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,289
James, you gotta throw something back!

781
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:04,161
Darnell!

782
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:05,760
Oh.

783
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:07,086
Save me!

784
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:11,448
<i>Attention inmates, lockdown in five minutes.</i>

785
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:13,961
<i>And don't try any stupid shit.</i>

786
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:29,003
What did they do to my yard?

787
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:31,925
No prison can hold James King.

788
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:42,168
- We got a runner. Mr. James is running!
- Oh, fuck me!

789
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,967
You're in my world now, bitch!

790
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,081
Mother... Shit!

791
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:55,720
You're never getting out alive! Ha, ha.

792
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:57,885
Fuck a bag of tits!

793
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:00,560
Release the dogs!

794
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:02,449
What? Dogs?

795
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:10,488
There's nowhere to run, Mr. James.

796
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:14,161
You don't know when to quit, Mr. James.

797
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,087
You couldn't get past Cecelio
and some Chihuahuas.

798
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:35,131
Tell me how you gonna escape San Quentin.
Stop wasting my time, James.

799
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:40,480
That's what happens
when you try to jump a fence illegally. Hm?

800
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:51,209
Your training's not going well, man.

801
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:54,125
Frankly, I don't feel like
you're giving me 100 percent.

802
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:57,170
And as your incarceration expert,
that concerns me.

803
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:59,408
Because it's my job to prepare you.

804
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:02,090
Fortunately, I got a plan.

805
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:04,447
Oh, thank God. Oh, that's good.

806
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:08,170
- You're gonna learn how to suck dick.
- What?!

807
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:10,891
Oh, God.

808
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:13,886
Listen up.
I said I want you to learn how to suck dick.

809
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,565
I heard you!

810
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:17,891
- That's your plan?
- Yes.

811
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:21,726
All I'm saying is that when life puts a
dick in your mouth, you make dickade.

812
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:25,202
"Dickade" doesn't sound like
a significant improvement over dick.

813
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:28,006
Bottom line, James!
I know what I'm talking about.

814
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,401
- We're talking about survival.
- I understand.

815
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:35,362
- Because that's how you survived. Right?
- No, you shut your mouth. No, it is not.

816
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:36,846
I survived with these.

817
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:41,042
- Dual hand jobs.
- No. No! I kill with these.

818
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,289
That's the difference between me and you.
Hence, why you need to suck a dick.

819
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:47,647
Come on, man.

820
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:51,081
Where am I gonna find someone who...?

821
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:52,844
We're at the lvars Brasserie.

822
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,240
Look around you.

823
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,448
This is L.A.'s number-one
gay hookup scene.

824
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:01,806
- Voted "Flirtiest Brunch" three years in a row.
- What do I say? What do I literally say?

825
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:05,123
You say, "I wanna suck your dick." Politely.

826
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:09,524
Hey, hi. I'm James.
You mind if I could give you a little head?

827
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,569
- Hey, I'm James.
- I wanna suck your dick.

828
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:13,927
- I wanna suck your dick.
- There you go! Just dive in!

829
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:16,003
- That's what they do.
- What if someone says no?

830
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:18,601
He ain't gonna say no.
It's a scientific fact.

831
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:19,841
According to who?

832
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:22,122
Dickapedia! Why do you care?

833
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:25,966
- Is that a real site?
- No. James, it's a... Get up.

834
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:29,442
You're gonna go to that bar.
That guy. That guy right there.

835
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:33,446
Get up, go over there, and politely ask
that man can you suck his dick.

836
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:36,451
Oh, my gosh.
I can't believe I'm about to do this.

837
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:38,045
Survival.

838
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:40,125
Go survive.

839
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:43,121
All right. I'll just go do it.

840
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:44,805
Yes, go do it.

841
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,007
Okay.

842
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,128
Come on. Are we doing this or not, okay?

843
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:53,970
Yes, we're definitely doing it.

844
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:57,640
Hey, I was nervous the first time
I did karaoke, right?

845
00:48:58,320 --> 00:48:59,685
Just get up there and sing.

846
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,403
This is terrible foreplay. Come on.

847
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:04,210
- I'm gonna put it in my mouth.
- Yeah.

848
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:07,330
I'm gonna suck your di...
Your di...

849
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:08,970
I'm gonna suck your di...

850
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:10,406
That's what we're here for.

851
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:13,848
I'll gonna put your di... in my mouth.
I'm gonna give you he...

852
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:15,166
Facial.

853
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:17,927
Down the hatch! Heh.

854
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:24,841
Eating alone?

855
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:28,162
I just thought you could use
some company.

856
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:30,249
Oh... Oh.

857
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:31,726
Okay, I see what this is.

858
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:35,001
You think that you can get with me?

859
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:40,366
- Interesting topic of conversation.
- Wait. No. That wasn't a sit-down invitation.

860
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:44,729
- You're like a 6.
- Thank you.

861
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:49,285
No, it's not a compliment.
That's not a good number. I'm like a 9.

862
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:51,808
If I were to get into this game...

863
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:54,320
- You know, the gay game...
- Uh-huh.

864
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:57,086
By the way,
the gay game is a game you can win.

865
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:00,881
No, it's not, because I don't wanna play.
I'm saying "if."

866
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:03,566
There's a spot on the bench for you,
if you decide to join.

867
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:05,609
No, I'm not on the bench, man.

868
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,364
Okay, starter! Heh.

869
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:08,766
I'm not gay, man.

870
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:12,925
I'm here, supporting a friend,
doing some gay stuff.

871
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:16,926
I'm sorry. My name is Chris. It's short
for Christmas Came Early This Year.

872
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:23,084
Where are you at, man?

873
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:24,721
Come on, man.

874
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:26,882
This is gonna help me in the long run.

875
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:29,924
- Here. Right there.
- Don't point it at me.

876
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:32,928
Hey! Have fun with it, right?

877
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:34,570
- Have fun with it.
- Yeah.

878
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:37,371
- Come on.
- Three, two, one! In the mouth!

879
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:53,808
Look, you're gonna
find you someone, man.

880
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:57,043
You just gotta set your sights on something
more realistic, you know?

881
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:00,011
You gotta think long-term.
Think about the relationship.

882
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:02,681
Who are you gonna raise
that Chinese baby with?

883
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:04,683
- I don't know.
- Hm?

884
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:08,128
Who are you gonna restore
that Airstream camper with?

885
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:12,046
Who are you gonna drive and open that
bed-and-breakfast in New Hampshire with?

886
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:14,925
- This is what I need to hear.
- Yes! Yes.

887
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:19,881
I can't do it. I really tried. I
just can't! You have to train me.

888
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:21,247
It's my last chance.

889
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:23,402
You ready to train harder
than you've ever trained?

890
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:26,007
Because once we go,
we do not hold back.

891
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:27,685
We do it! And we do it hard!

892
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:29,080
Are you ready to get hard?

893
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:30,890
I am ready. I'm ready to get hard!

894
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:33,247
- You're gonna show me you can get hard!
- I'm gonna show you!

895
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:35,760
I'm gonna get so hard!
Because I'm gonna show you how hard!

896
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:38,850
That's what I wanna hear.
Then let's go home and get hard.

897
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:50,202
I want what they have.

898
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:53,045
Yeah!

899
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:54,690
Yeah, James!

900
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:55,927
Yeah!

901
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:01,410
- Unh!
- Yeah!

902
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:02,971
That's what I'm talking about!

903
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,043
- Ugh.
- Sho' enough!

904
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:08,251
Fear of dick-sucking
will give a man strength.

905
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:14,085
Fuck you.

906
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:15,969
Fuck cock!

907
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:17,561
Shit!

908
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:22,681
Hey, back off! You better get those tits
out of my face! Or I'll show you my tits!

909
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:25,491
- What are you doing?
- Working on my trash talk.

910
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:27,682
You know, to get respect
from the other inmates.

911
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:29,445
Let me hear some of it.

912
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:32,488
All right. Ahem.

913
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:36,404
Hey, pal. I'm about to tear you a new ass.

914
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:39,801
You gonna have to do a little better
than that, James.

915
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,448
Hey, I'm about to tear you a new ass.

916
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:44,602
And sew up your old ass!

917
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:46,685
Okay. All right.

918
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:48,842
I'm gonna punch you in the fuck!

919
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,082
I'm gonna make you my bitch's bitch!

920
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:53,641
You're gonna be my grand-bitch!

921
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:57,208
Yeah. You're about to 20 likes
on Instafuck.

922
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:01,084
If I see you around here again,
I'm gonna put a hashtag on your ass.

923
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:03,408
And see how many hits it gets.

924
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:05,484
- Hmm?
- Oh, my God.

925
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:08,928
Hope you brought your Costco card,
because you're about to get dick in bulk!

926
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:11,089
What? This is so dark.

927
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:14,210
How does a prix fixe dinner
of five courses of dick sound?

928
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:16,328
- You eat organic?
- What?

929
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:20,451
How about fresh farm-to-table,
a purée of my balls!

930
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:25,128
Yeah. Merry Dickmas, Santa Cock!
Hmm?

931
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:26,771
Okay. All right, man.

932
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:28,490
Where is this stuff coming from, James?

933
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:31,849
Hey, son.
You're a disappointment to your parents.

934
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,411
Who I fucked!

935
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:34,840
Oh, shit.

936
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,765
James, this is sick.
You gotta be crazy to think of this.

937
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:39,770
That crazy is good.

938
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:42,605
Thank you. I've got about six hours more.

939
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:45,081
That's good, James. That's really good.

940
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:48,601
I like that. I like that a lot.

941
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:53,325
I hope you brought your dick punch-card
because the eighth dick is free.

942
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:54,720
Stab!

943
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:57,169
Shit! Okay.

944
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:59,131
That's not bad, James.

945
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:01,609
That's not bad at all.

946
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:03,281
Progress.

947
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:13,681
Peter piper picked a peck
of pickled cocks!

948
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:16,966
Yes.

949
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:26,368
Hey, hey, hey!
You ready to get to work today?

950
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:29,645
Huh?

951
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:32,371
- Hello.
- What's all this stuff?

952
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:34,130
Oh, these are shanks.

953
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:35,725
Or "shivs."

954
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:38,969
In Scotland, they're referred to as "chibs."

955
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:43,170
In fact, I made this one for you.

956
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:46,284
- Really?
- Yeah.

957
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:49,531
Just to say thank you
for all the hard work.

958
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,167
Oh, man.

959
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:54,445
That's nice. That's cool.

960
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:59,328
Whoa, whoa. Don't hold it by the blade.
Haven't you ever held one before? Right here.

961
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:02,730
Yeah, no, my cellie
used to hold them all the time.

962
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:04,962
I don't like them.
They cause too much trouble.

963
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:07,771
You pull that out on the yard, somebody come
out attack you, they can do this to you.

964
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:09,968
Now what do you do?
You know what I mean?

965
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:14,808
What the hell? Where'd that come from?

966
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:16,291
I taught myself how to keister.

967
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:20,284
How to keister? Up the keister?

968
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:23,444
Look, the electronic toothbrush part,
it still works.

969
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:26,171
Oh, no. Okay, James. Cut it off.

970
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:28,324
Cut it off. Get it out of my face, man.

971
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:29,925
I can turn it on with no hands.

972
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:32,367
I don't want to see that.
I don't want to see that trick.

973
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:34,363
It's okay. Put it back. God.

974
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:36,249
- Put it back?
- No. No, no.

975
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,323
Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Please.

976
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:41,091
- Do you want me to teach you how?
- No, I'm gonna pass on that.

977
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:43,129
It starts with a simple inverse inhale.

978
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:46,367
James, stop it.

979
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:49,126
That, with a simultaneous
relaxing of the sphincter.

980
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:51,005
I don't wanna know.

981
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:52,406
You sure?

982
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:55,609
I'm positive.
I just wanna ask you one question.

983
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:59,606
I was over there,
and I was touching all those shanks.

984
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,411
Were they, uh...?

985
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:05,721
- Keistered?
- Yeah. Were they keistered?

986
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:09,522
Most of them. Yeah.

987
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:21,330
We're about to simulate a prison riot.

988
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:23,966
Understand that this is
the most dangerous situation there is.

989
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:26,202
Prisoners are scared.
Guards are scared.

990
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:29,165
The key to surviving is to not freak out.

991
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:33,251
- Good Lord. What's gonna happen?
- Cecelio's just gonna throw some stuff at you.

992
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:35,846
Some roosters, some mangly
homeless guys, whatever he's got.

993
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,970
- He's really excited about this.
- Okay. Let's do it.

994
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:40,605
Wait, don't I get body armor?

995
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:43,081
No. We don't have that type of time.
Cecelio!

996
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:44,765
Why don't we have enough time?

997
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:47,088
Remember, do not freak out.

998
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:48,366
Lights!

999
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:49,567
Music!

1000
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:50,801
Who wants to party?!

1001
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:54,364
Go! Go! Go!

1002
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:56,522
Cecelio! Release the chickens!

1003
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:58,722
No, no, no, James! Don't freak out!

1004
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:00,450
Darnell, there's a baboon!

1005
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:03,244
- You're in my world now!
- Aah!

1006
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:05,606
Someone let me out!

1007
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:07,091
Stop freaking out!

1008
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:11,288
It's fucking beautiful!

1009
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:15,806
Oh, shit!

1010
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:18,049
Die! Die!

1011
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:23,485
Cecelio, turn it off!

1012
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:25,290
Turn it off!

1013
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:26,966
Turn it off!

1014
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:28,645
James, I've lost control!

1015
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:32,526
Cecelio! Pull back! I have lost control!

1016
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:35,170
Oh, my God!

1017
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:36,685
- God!
- Oh, my God.

1018
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:38,001
Shit!

1019
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:39,491
- I'm stabbed!
- No!

1020
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:41,569
- I'm cut!
- No, you cut me, man!

1021
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:42,926
You stabbed me!

1022
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:44,280
- No, I didn't!
- Yes, you did!

1023
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:48,120
I told you, don't freak out!
You freaked out! God! Wait...

1024
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:49,691
- No, I'm okay.
- Hold up.

1025
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:51,604
It's just the wine.

1026
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:53,046
I see all the wine, man.

1027
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:54,326
I totally feel fine.

1028
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:56,724
- Oh, fuck!
- What? It's a...

1029
00:57:58,200 --> 00:57:59,326
Oh.

1030
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:03,246
- Oh, that's where the other one went.
- Okay, just sit down.

1031
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:05,482
- It's a shiv. It's just a shiv.
- Yes, I know.

1032
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:06,880
Hey, don't freak out.

1033
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:08,160
- I'm gonna pull it.
- Okay.

1034
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:15,206
Oh, my God.

1035
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:18,011
It's like a fishhook. The more you pull,
the deeper it lodges.

1036
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:21,607
All right. Okay. Look, my wife's a nurse.
Let's get you to my wife. Okay?

1037
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:23,808
God. Oh, God.

1038
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:25,803
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1039
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:28,289
It's sticking right out of my head.

1040
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:31,962
James, listen. I don't want to look at it
no more because I'm starting to...

1041
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:33,565
Oh, shit. I'm so scared.

1042
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:35,961
I know. Can you fucking
just keep your head...

1043
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:37,731
Ow!

1044
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:40,925
- Oh, God!
- You drove it in a little deeper.

1045
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:44,522
Oh, God. Oh, James, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1046
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:46,489
- Is my eye twitching?
- No!

1047
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:49,325
- Answer the question. Is my eye twitching?
- It look fine.

1048
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:53,690
- Yeah? Does it look fine?
- Yeah, fine, man. There's nothing wrong.

1049
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:56,201
- Let's play a memory game, okay? Engage.
- Yes.

1050
00:58:56,360 --> 00:58:58,840
- Give me 12 months.
- Months.

1051
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,331
One, two...

1052
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:01,561
- No.
- Four...

1053
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:03,603
Summer, Christmas...

1054
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:06,127
- What?
- Baked potato...

1055
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:08,806
- What is "baked potato"?
- Wait. Did I leave one out?

1056
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:11,327
No. You're right. You're right.
Those are the months.

1057
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:13,881
Thanks for driving me to college, Dad.

1058
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:16,441
What? What the fuck?

1059
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:20,685
But don't start crying when you drop me off
at the dorm, because then I'll start crying.

1060
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:23,609
I love you, Dad.

1061
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:26,564
Love you too, man.

1062
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:30,249
- This is where I need to get out.
- James! No! No!

1063
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:34,729
Close the door! Close the door!

1064
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:37,082
- Are we at Coachella?
- No, James!

1065
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:45,242
Rita, thank you once again
for taking the knife out of my head.

1066
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:47,010
Mm.

1067
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:04,811
Makayla, what...?

1068
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,240
Young lady.

1069
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:08,243
But he's doing it.

1070
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:09,731
This is delicious.

1071
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:12,931
- Okay, James. James.
- Grr.

1072
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:16,004
Stop. Stop. You don't have to eat like that.
You're on furlough.

1073
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:17,491
Mm.

1074
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:20,565
Sorry. It's part of my training.

1075
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:23,611
If you let someone mess with your food,
you're a punk.

1076
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:25,720
It's delicious, though.

1077
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:28,602
Look, you need to shut this stuff down
right now.

1078
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:32,003
Do you understand you're gonna get him
killed before he even gets to prison?

1079
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:34,845
- What are you talking about?
- Darnell's doing a wonderful job.

1080
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,843
- He's a great teacher.
- See that?

1081
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,570
And a great friend.

1082
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:41,844
I just can't figure out how he ever
went to jail in the first place.

1083
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,365
Gosh, me neither.

1084
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:47,007
Darnell, have you every shared
with James the story of how you went away?

1085
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:48,281
No, he hasn't.

1086
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:50,488
Well, he's not really ready
for that right now.

1087
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:52,642
And I got Makayla at the table.

1088
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:56,043
I mean, she's the daughter of a convicted felon.
She's strong.

1089
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:57,531
- Mm-hm.
- Good point.

1090
01:00:57,680 --> 01:01:00,843
Why don't you tell it?
Don't leave out details.

1091
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:07,130
I'd love to hear it.
I think it could really help me.

1092
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:10,600
Okay, uh...

1093
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:14,763
We was just some boys in the hood.

1094
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:18,527
Me, my man, Ricky, and Doughboy.

1095
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:22,090
Doughboy's real name was Russell.
We was close, man.

1096
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:25,409
Thing about Ricky, Ricky was special,
because Ricky had the ticket.

1097
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:29,804
Ricky was star quarterback.
You know, he had a college future.

1098
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:31,803
He was our golden boy, you know?

1099
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:35,328
We got into it with some other guys.
You know, some gangbang stuff.

1100
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:37,642
Uh, on the way home we decide to split up.

1101
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:40,488
Me and Doughboy said we'll go this way.

1102
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:41,971
Ricky said he'll go this way.

1103
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:45,491
Me and Doughboy come around,
we see Ricky on the ground.

1104
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:47,771
Ricky got shot.

1105
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:49,809
I run over there.
I'm running, I'm running.

1106
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:53,646
I grab him. I got his head on my arm.
I'm looking. I'm like, "Ricky!

1107
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:56,201
Ricky!"

1108
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:03,481
"Ricky."

1109
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:06,566
He had the ticket!

1110
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:08,600
They got him.

1111
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:11,884
Doughboy's like, "Come on, man. Get up.
Let him be. He's done."

1112
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:13,766
I get up.

1113
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:17,288
Doughboy says, "You know what this mean.
This mean we gotta step up."

1114
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:20,205
I said, "You damn right, it does."
So we strapped up.

1115
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:23,843
- I don't know what that means.
- It means we got the burners.

1116
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,331
I don't know what that means.

1117
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:28,404
It means we went and got the guns.

1118
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:31,321
We saw those guys later that night.

1119
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:33,721
Three headshots. Pop! Pop! Pop!

1120
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:37,566
- "That's for Ricky!"
- For sure.

1121
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:40,440
Cops came, man.

1122
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:43,962
I told Doughboy I'd take the rap.

1123
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:48,245
I said, "You go ahead. Live your life.
I'll tell them it was me."

1124
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:50,728
Cops came. I said, "I did it."

1125
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:52,325
I went to jail.

1126
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:59,046
You gave your life and your freedom
for Russell.

1127
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:01,090
Loyal to a fault.

1128
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:04,171
It is what it is.

1129
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:06,408
That's why I wash cars today.

1130
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:08,050
Because I got blood on my hands.

1131
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:09,770
Just like Lady Macbeth.

1132
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:12,607
- Huh?
- Like <i>Macbeth.</i>

1133
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:13,807
Yes.

1134
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:16,610
- Yes.
- Phew.

1135
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:18,000
Wow, what a story.

1136
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:20,290
Almost sounds like a movie.

1137
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:22,130
Phew. Yeah.

1138
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:23,486
Mm-hm.

1139
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:29,090
Darnell, why don't you tell him about that time
that that white lady came and adopted you...

1140
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:31,328
...and turned you into an offensive tackle.

1141
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:34,123
I think we've talked enough tonight.

1142
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:36,163
Oh. There's my cab.

1143
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:40,610
I'd better get back before lockdown
or Cecelio will put me in the hole.

1144
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:43,047
He loves putting me in the hole.

1145
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,367
- Well, let me walk you out, man.
- No, that's fine.

1146
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:48,841
Thanks for everything.

1147
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,843
James, it was wonderful meeting you.

1148
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,126
Great to meet you too.

1149
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:55,962
You know, growing up, my family would
never spend any time together like this.

1150
01:03:56,360 --> 01:03:57,566
You guys are very lucky.

1151
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:02,126
- Bye, Makayla.
- Bye, Mr. King.

1152
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:04,410
Bye-bye.

1153
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:09,801
Hey, your dad never went to jail, okay?

1154
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:12,442
I've seen <i>Boyz n the Hood.</i>

1155
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:15,244
Who showed you <i>Boyz n the Hood?</i>

1156
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:17,004
Daddy, I don't think he did it.

1157
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:18,406
Of course he didn't.

1158
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:21,166
You need to do something
that's really gonna help him.

1159
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:24,130
He will not last in prison.

1160
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:26,328
He wouldn't even last in my school.

1161
01:04:57,320 --> 01:04:58,606
Hello, this is James.

1162
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:01,691
Hey. It's me, Darnell.
Look, man, I've been thinking it over...

1163
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:05,003
...and it might be a good idea to get
you extra protection on the inside.

1164
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:08,084
So tomorrow we're gonna go over
to my cousin Russell's house. Now listen.

1165
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:10,521
<i>Russell and his friends,
they're different dudes.</i>

1166
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:12,210
Very suspicious of outsiders.

1167
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:15,523
You walking in there, they're probably
gonna think you a cop off the bat.

1168
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:19,805
So I need you to do something for me
so we don't create any dangerous situations.

1169
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:21,166
<i>- Dress casually.</i>
- Blackface.

1170
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:22,526
What the fuck was that?!

1171
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:25,724
- See you tomorrow.
<i>- James. James.</i>

1172
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:28,531
James, don't do nothing stupid.
Just dress casual.

1173
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:13,722
- Nice whip.
- What the hell are you doing?

1174
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:16,451
- Who you supposed to be dressed like, James?
- Little Wayne.

1175
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:19,683
- It's what he wore at his last runway show.
- Oh, Lil Wayne.

1176
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:24,846
You told me I needed to try to fit in, so I
stayed up all last night studying your culture.

1177
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:27,162
- I'm sorry, what?
- And to those who say jazz...

1178
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:32,451
...is the only indigenous American art form,
I say listen to a little Jay-Z, my friend.

1179
01:06:32,600 --> 01:06:33,931
Oh.

1180
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:36,481
I forgot the gin and juice.
Should I run back inside?

1181
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:51,006
Will you stop?

1182
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:54,008
I'm not trying to appropriate your culture.

1183
01:06:54,560 --> 01:06:56,927
- That's great. I'll tell the others.
- I'm just saying...

1184
01:06:57,080 --> 01:06:59,811
...hip-hop is a very sophisticated,
multifaceted subculture...

1185
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:02,201
...that speaks
to all different types of people.

1186
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:06,331
The music, the fashions,
the attitudes, the beefs...

1187
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:08,847
The more I read, the more I listened...

1188
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:12,761
...the more I felt connected
to its rich cultural tapestry.

1189
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:16,248
That is really great. Now, can we please
be done with this conversation?

1190
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:18,840
Please stop.

1191
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:23,808
I think I know who killed Tupac.

1192
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:33,811
- I got next!
- What the fuck?

1193
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:36,168
- Hello.
- I'm gonna put a cap in yo ass.

1194
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:38,245
Who the fuck are you?!

1195
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:41,051
- Yo, he's good. He with me.
- And who the fuck are you, nigga?

1196
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:43,570
Hey, Russell. Russell!

1197
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:45,486
Russell.

1198
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:47,483
Russell! Excuse me.

1199
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:50,211
Hello. James King,
Senior Fund Manager, Wealthrop Funds.

1200
01:07:50,360 --> 01:07:52,601
- James, come on.
- Excuse me. Right through here.

1201
01:07:55,640 --> 01:08:00,328
Hell no, man. Is this the motherfucker who
you said you had to get ready for prison, man?

1202
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:06,802
Well, I need protection,
and I'm hoping to join the Crenshaw Kings.

1203
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:08,200
Are you? Ha-ha-ha.

1204
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:13,924
I've seen white people before. My probation
officer is white. You know what I'm saying?

1205
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:17,084
But you, motherfucker, man,
you white as mayonnaise, man. Ha-ha-ha.

1206
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:22,766
Oh, shit. Maybe in blackface. Who knows?
Ha-ha-ha.

1207
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:25,964
Hey, listen. I tell you what though.

1208
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:28,242
You damn sure
got your get-up right, man.

1209
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:32,121
I mean, camouflage and cheetah print,
that's straight out the gangbanger's handbook.

1210
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:34,649
Yeah, yeah, like Lil Wayne, right?

1211
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:36,281
Exactly. Thank you.

1212
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:38,365
<i>I love it.</i>

1213
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:40,961
Look, he's not trying
to be a member, okay?

1214
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:43,851
He just wants you to protect him
while he's on the inside.

1215
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,731
Like you did for Darnell
when he took the rap for you.

1216
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:48,247
What?

1217
01:08:50,280 --> 01:08:52,965
We can talk about that another time.

1218
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:55,121
- Yeah.
- No.

1219
01:08:55,280 --> 01:08:56,645
So let's let that go.

1220
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:58,245
You remember. You know.

1221
01:08:58,440 --> 01:09:00,920
With what Ricky did and the ticket...

1222
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:04,847
...and you freaked out and Darnell
took control of the situation.

1223
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:07,646
- Stop.
- Is this motherfucking...?

1224
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:09,689
<i>Boyz n the Hood,</i> man.

1225
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:14,767
- This is a bad time.
- Okay, I tell you what, man.

1226
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:16,291
I tell you what:

1227
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:18,170
Humor me.

1228
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:20,004
I'm a fair person.

1229
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:21,844
And I'm a businessman.

1230
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:23,850
Clear professional.

1231
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:26,045
What's your life worth to you?

1232
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:29,601
- How does a million dollars sound?
- Ha-ha-ha.

1233
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:31,603
"How does a million dollars sound?"
Ha-ha-ha.

1234
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:35,006
Hold up, everybody.
Stand back. I'll handle it.

1235
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:36,605
How does a million dollars sound?

1236
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:41,049
Million dollars sound like a one with six zeros
behind it with two commas separating them.

1237
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:44,443
However, from the sound of CNN
and the looks of <i>The Wall Street Journal...</i>

1238
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:48,889
...and everybody else with eyes and ears go
to get they news, you broke, motherfucker.

1239
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:53,285
Your assets have been frozen
with no chances of thawing anytime soon.

1240
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:56,011
So you probably got as much or less...

1241
01:09:56,160 --> 01:09:59,528
...than this little no-good, manipulative,
degenerate motherfucker...

1242
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:01,409
...right here next to you.

1243
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:05,042
Which forces me to ask the question,
"Are you fucking with me?"

1244
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:07,771
You think this a motherfucking game?
You think I'm playing?

1245
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:09,922
Why would you come up in my hood,
in my house...

1246
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:13,641
...and present yourself as something you not,
offering shit you can't deliver?

1247
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:16,280
- Did this motherfucker tell you to lie to me?
- Russ.

1248
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:18,403
Shut the fuck up, man.

1249
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:23,003
I think, real fast, you need to tell me
what the fuck you gonna do...

1250
01:10:23,160 --> 01:10:25,925
...to make me wanna keep motherfuckers
off your ass.

1251
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:28,962
You're talking to James King.

1252
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:32,609
Let me create wealth for you.

1253
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:39,085
So the normal minimum buy-in
to the Nexel Fund is 5 million...

1254
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:42,562
...but I can get you guys in using
a brokerage pocket account.

1255
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:46,520
In other words, liquidate two bricks
of cocaine and park it right here.

1256
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:50,964
With the historical performance of the fund,
that's gonna double every three to five years...

1257
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:54,727
...and we're looking at,
mm, $1.2 million easy.

1258
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:57,929
Ain't no way you're making that much money
without committing a crime.

1259
01:10:58,080 --> 01:10:59,525
With apologies to Balzac.

1260
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:01,921
What the fuck?
You talking about my ballsack?

1261
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:05,971
No. What we're gonna do
is we get other people's money...

1262
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:08,407
...who've made an opposite prediction
on the market.

1263
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:10,961
Okay, we gonna roll on them
and take they money.

1264
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:13,606
Just how strapped
are these loser motherfuckers?

1265
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:15,330
Oh, I wouldn't worry.

1266
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:17,528
I've taken millions from them...

1267
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:20,490
...and they haven't stepped to me yet.

1268
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:23,043
Loser motherfuckers.

1269
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:25,883
Damn. Mayo is badass.

1270
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:29,522
Stock market is gangster. Take what's
yours and fuck the other guy, right?

1271
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:32,531
Wall Street, man.
Those are the real criminals.

1272
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:34,722
Those guys get away with murder.

1273
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:38,009
Wait, man.
You murder people all the time, Black.

1274
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:40,926
Oh, yeah. Murder's my favorite.

1275
01:11:43,160 --> 01:11:45,561
And they think, "Oh, please, don't kill me."

1276
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:49,371
I love it. And I'm like,
"I'm not gonna kill you."

1277
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:52,091
They relax, then I'm like,
"Boom, get on the ground now!

1278
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:54,248
Get on the ground! Get on the ground!"

1279
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:57,768
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

1280
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:04,642
- I get excited about murder.
- Don't worry about it.

1281
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:07,320
I'm... I'm laughing.

1282
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:14,487
You should know, you did all right this time.

1283
01:12:14,680 --> 01:12:16,250
Your boy, Mayo, is an earner.

1284
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:18,402
Are you gonna get him some help
on the inside?

1285
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:19,965
I'll help him.

1286
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:23,488
But not with us.
You know, inside it's all about color.

1287
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:24,801
Dude need a white gang.

1288
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:26,531
A very white gang.

1289
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:28,849
But I'll put the play together.

1290
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:41,970
That's the gang I have to join?

1291
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:43,610
They seem kind of racist.

1292
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:45,603
Ain't no "kind of." They are.

1293
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:47,569
That's the Alliance of Whites.

1294
01:12:47,720 --> 01:12:50,087
That's also your only chance
of survival in prison...

1295
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:53,801
...so you need to go in there and you need to
make them believe that you're one of them.

1296
01:12:54,280 --> 01:12:58,171
Matter of fact, call me the N-word. But say
it like you mean it, though. Let me hear it.

1297
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:00,642
What? No.

1298
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:04,282
That's the wrong N-word. Come on, James,
I'm giving you a free pass right now.

1299
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:08,930
In this truck, the N-word is perfectly fine.
Just another word right now. Go ahead.

1300
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:11,202
That still doesn't feel...

1301
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:13,767
Let's try this.
What's that place where your leg bends?

1302
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:15,087
My knee?

1303
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:18,011
Okay. And, uh, what noise
does a angry dog make?

1304
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:20,563
- Grr?
- Put it together, though.

1305
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:22,370
Knee. Knee-grr.

1306
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:24,850
- Ow!
- Oh, shit! I'm sorry.

1307
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:28,681
I am sorry, man, that just happened.

1308
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:30,450
That literally just happened.

1309
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:32,409
Wow, I got you good too.

1310
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:34,289
It just, like, jumped out, man.

1311
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:36,283
It was a reflex. I really can't tell you.

1312
01:13:36,440 --> 01:13:38,442
I didn't even say it.
I was saying two other words.

1313
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:40,440
I apologize, James.
What do you want me to do?

1314
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:43,286
Just get your ass out the car
and go in there, act hard.

1315
01:13:43,720 --> 01:13:46,041
Fit in, man. Go ahead.

1316
01:13:48,160 --> 01:13:49,969
Cut the light off! Shit!

1317
01:13:58,640 --> 01:13:59,687
Fuck yeah!

1318
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:11,967
Spider, you're up.

1319
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:14,049
Watch and learn, son.

1320
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:19,646
Hi.

1321
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:23,127
Um...

1322
01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:26,841
If I could have your attention, please.
I'm just looking for Spider?

1323
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,331
He's a narc!

1324
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:34,002
Listen, this relationship
can't just be built around him.

1325
01:14:34,160 --> 01:14:36,128
You got a right to be happy too,
you know?

1326
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:40,320
<i>And I am, I am. And I think I'm open
to it now because of our talk.</i>

1327
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:44,485
Yeah. That's good. I love the fact
that you're listening. I love that.

1328
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:47,484
<i>You know, you're the best boyfriend
I never had.</i>

1329
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:49,369
Ha, ha. Okay. Ha-ha-ha.

1330
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:53,370
<i>Yeah, well, I'm not totally giving up.
There is time.</i>

1331
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:56,205
<i>- And things change with time.</i>
- No, no, they don't.

1332
01:14:56,360 --> 01:14:59,091
No. No, no. That's never gonna happen.

1333
01:14:59,240 --> 01:15:02,210
<i>- You say that now.</i>
- No, no, no. I'm always gonna say that.

1334
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:04,243
<i>- Okay.</i>
- Ha-ha-ha.

1335
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:05,447
Okay.

1336
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:09,046
Oh, shit.

1337
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:11,726
Hey, I gotta go, okay?

1338
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:13,484
So I'll talk to you later. Have fun.

1339
01:15:23,240 --> 01:15:25,242
Private club, Jew Hair.

1340
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:28,407
Good one, Spider.

1341
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:32,201
I walked right into that one. Heh.

1342
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:35,728
James King. Protestant.

1343
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:41,160
But Russell,
from the Crenshaw Kings, referred me?

1344
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:43,322
Yeah, Russell said you'd be by.

1345
01:15:43,480 --> 01:15:46,290
Anyway, I'm going to prison
and I need protection.

1346
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:48,562
Well, welcome to the club, Jimbo.

1347
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:50,325
Great! Oh, good!

1348
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:53,126
But you get protection from us,
we got rules.

1349
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:55,000
Principles.

1350
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:57,010
Rule number one:

1351
01:15:57,400 --> 01:16:01,121
When you're on the inside, you don't
hang out with the niggers or the spics.

1352
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:04,166
Now, do you have a problem
with that, brother?

1353
01:16:04,520 --> 01:16:05,760
Me?

1354
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:08,930
Of course not.

1355
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:12,963
Spider, what do you take me for?

1356
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:15,282
I'm a big-time racist.

1357
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:17,971
I hate the knee.

1358
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:19,451
What?

1359
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:21,401
What is this shit?

1360
01:16:22,280 --> 01:16:26,922
I mean, heck, I'm such a racist
that my chess set, I only have white pieces.

1361
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:29,043
It's confusing, but I don't...

1362
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:31,409
I won't give the blacks a chance to win.

1363
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:33,244
Oh, shit.

1364
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:35,121
He's a fucking cop.

1365
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:36,770
- He's a cop!
- I smell bacon.

1366
01:16:36,920 --> 01:16:38,570
- I'm not a cop.
- Fucking hate narcs.

1367
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:40,330
We'll find out what he is.

1368
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:46,281
Yeah.

1369
01:16:48,920 --> 01:16:50,126
Oh, God.

1370
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:52,521
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit. Oh, my God.

1371
01:16:56,440 --> 01:17:00,490
I'm just wondering if maybe I'm not
the best fit for the Alliance of Whites.

1372
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:04,531
You got anything to confess
before I rip your face off?

1373
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:06,085
Fine! Go ahead!

1374
01:17:06,240 --> 01:17:09,483
Kill me!
But please tell the world I'm not a thief!

1375
01:17:09,680 --> 01:17:11,682
I did not do the things they said I did!

1376
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:18,491
Promise me, Spider! Promise me!

1377
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:20,167
Burn him.

1378
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:27,450
The fuck was that?!

1379
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:30,571
That's right!

1380
01:17:30,720 --> 01:17:35,521
A black man just came in with a flamethrower,
just like you always knew would happen!

1381
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:38,526
Yeah!

1382
01:17:38,680 --> 01:17:40,250
The devil in here, bitch!

1383
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:41,686
And he's a black man.

1384
01:17:41,880 --> 01:17:44,451
Stay yo ass back! Stay back!

1385
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:46,443
James! Let's go!

1386
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:47,687
Yeah.

1387
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:50,364
- You all right?
- Yeah. Come on.

1388
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:52,603
Come on. Come on, let's go.

1389
01:17:54,120 --> 01:17:57,329
You know what? I got something
I wanna say to y'all since I'm guessing...

1390
01:17:57,520 --> 01:18:01,081
...this is the first time that you've ever
been forced to listen to a black man.

1391
01:18:01,240 --> 01:18:03,720
You know, maybe you guys
should just calm the fuck down.

1392
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:05,609
Black people ain't trying to hurt you!

1393
01:18:06,120 --> 01:18:07,849
I mean, technically, I am right now.

1394
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:11,561
But that's only because of what you
were trying to do to the white guy.

1395
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:12,767
Think about that!

1396
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:15,169
Google "I Have a Dream," assholes!

1397
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:18,321
It's a teachable moment here, people.

1398
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:20,644
Should burn everybody in here.

1399
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:26,686
Run, James!

1400
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:30,364
- Oh, shit!
- Bring me their fucking heads!

1401
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:32,204
Run, James! Run!

1402
01:18:33,320 --> 01:18:36,085
What the fuck
are you knocking over the bike for?! Run!

1403
01:18:36,280 --> 01:18:39,409
Oh, God.
You just couldn't say "nigger", huh?

1404
01:18:39,560 --> 01:18:42,245
What?! You can't see the irony
in being mad at me about that?

1405
01:18:42,440 --> 01:18:44,124
- No!
- Motherfuckers!

1406
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:48,967
- It's Nazi titties!
- And they're huge!

1407
01:18:52,280 --> 01:18:53,611
Get out!

1408
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:55,567
Oh, shit!

1409
01:18:55,720 --> 01:18:57,760
- Whoa!
- Bitch, get your white ass off!

1410
01:18:58,200 --> 01:18:59,281
Goddamn it! Ugh!

1411
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:02,371
Oh, go, go, go!

1412
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:06,044
- You blew up my club, Jew Hair!
- Oh, shit!

1413
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:08,009
Post-racial America, assholes!

1414
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:10,686
- Fuck you, Nazis!
- Yeah!

1415
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:17,526
I'm so glad to be back in Crenshaw
where it's safe.

1416
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:22,800
My heart is just now finally settling.

1417
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:25,645
Yeah. We're alive.

1418
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:29,247
How about we make a toast
to escaping fucking Nazis.

1419
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:31,368
Yes. Heh.

1420
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:39,609
You really are innocent, aren't you?

1421
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:40,801
Yes.

1422
01:19:41,480 --> 01:19:43,642
- Absolutely.
- Okay, so James, if that's the case...

1423
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:46,366
...then why aren't you trying to find
the guy that framed you?

1424
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:48,124
We are.

1425
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:49,800
Who are?

1426
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:54,087
Now, Martin has a team of investigators
working around the clock.

1427
01:19:54,240 --> 01:19:57,847
He's keeping me up to date.
But the million-dollar question is:

1428
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:01,083
- Who falsified my transaction records?
- All right, lay it on me.

1429
01:20:01,240 --> 01:20:03,811
All right. Now, this is very complicated
to follow.

1430
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:07,442
I don't expect you to get it on the first pass,
so listen very carefully.

1431
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:10,080
The one thing you need to understand
at the Wealthrop Fund...

1432
01:20:10,280 --> 01:20:12,931
...is that everything
flows through Martin.

1433
01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:14,525
- Okay?
- Okay

1434
01:20:14,680 --> 01:20:17,365
Any sort of contact
with the clearing house, the traders...

1435
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:20,330
...access to trading records
and client information...

1436
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:22,482
...international accounts, institutions...

1437
01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:27,168
...and, of course, the doling out
of commissions all goes through Martin.

1438
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:30,723
- So it's Martin.
- No.

1439
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:33,486
Are you fucking ki...?
It's common sense, James.

1440
01:20:33,680 --> 01:20:36,809
Look! All arrows point to Martin!

1441
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:39,725
The only name on the board
is fucking Martin!

1442
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:41,241
Martin! Martin! Martin!

1443
01:20:42,040 --> 01:20:44,441
Come on! James, you need to focus.

1444
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:47,080
You're going to prison
unless you can prove that Martin did it.

1445
01:20:47,200 --> 01:20:49,089
We'd need to get a hold
of the master records...

1446
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:52,045
...which is a log of all transactions
made by anyone in the firm.

1447
01:20:52,240 --> 01:20:54,891
- Okay, how do we get it?
- Martin has the original copy...

1448
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:57,805
...on the same computer that he had
when he started the company.

1449
01:20:57,960 --> 01:21:00,566
You got to be the dumbest genius I've...
Get up, James!

1450
01:21:01,680 --> 01:21:03,728
- All right.
- Fuck the board! Let's go, James!

1451
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:05,410
We're going to Martin's office.

1452
01:21:12,120 --> 01:21:15,249
Act natural, James.
You walking like you guilty.

1453
01:21:15,800 --> 01:21:17,882
- Hey, big guy, you catch the game?
- Yeah.

1454
01:21:18,040 --> 01:21:20,884
Hey, big guy, my name is Ken.
I work here.

1455
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:29,845
It's in this cabinet.

1456
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,970
We just have to figure out a way
to get the door open.

1457
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:34,610
Watch out.

1458
01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:37,441
I got it.

1459
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:41,561
Ugh. There it is. Same computer he had
when he started the company.

1460
01:21:41,720 --> 01:21:42,767
It's a good luck charm.

1461
01:21:42,920 --> 01:21:44,206
Good luck charm, my ass.

1462
01:21:44,360 --> 01:21:48,365
It has no connection to the outside world.
No emails, no internet, no trace.

1463
01:21:49,680 --> 01:21:51,967
There it is. The master records.

1464
01:21:52,120 --> 01:21:54,771
That's what we need.
This will clear my name.

1465
01:21:54,920 --> 01:21:56,684
Well, then let's not waste time. Get it.

1466
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:01,771
Yes! I'm not going to prison.

1467
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:04,482
More importantly,
I'm not gonna be anyone's bitch.

1468
01:22:04,640 --> 01:22:06,802
Hey, you are living the dream, my friend.

1469
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:08,923
- Darnell?
- Yeah?

1470
01:22:09,080 --> 01:22:10,320
Look, you saved my life.

1471
01:22:10,720 --> 01:22:13,530
- I don't know how I'll ever repay you.
- Oh, come on, man.

1472
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:18,206
Just this once.

1473
01:22:22,280 --> 01:22:23,691
All right, break it up.

1474
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:28,241
Leave the cart there and back away.
Move away, come on. Move, move.

1475
01:22:29,240 --> 01:22:32,050
I actually respect you for trying,
but enough is enough, James.

1476
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:33,687
All right.

1477
01:22:35,960 --> 01:22:37,371
What are you doing?

1478
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:39,491
James, what are you doing?

1479
01:22:39,680 --> 01:22:40,841
Don't mad-dog, James.

1480
01:22:43,320 --> 01:22:44,731
He's gonna shoot us.

1481
01:22:45,240 --> 01:22:46,480
What the fuck?!

1482
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:48,960
No. He's gonna kill us, man.

1483
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:51,003
- Do you want some?!
- Oh, fuck!

1484
01:22:51,160 --> 01:22:52,889
- Do you wanna step with me?!
- God!

1485
01:22:53,360 --> 01:22:54,407
You'd better... Don't...

1486
01:22:56,280 --> 01:22:57,327
Oh.

1487
01:22:57,480 --> 01:22:59,005
The gun! Grab the gun!

1488
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:01,168
- Huh?
- Why don't you pick up the gun!

1489
01:23:01,320 --> 01:23:02,367
Uh...

1490
01:23:02,520 --> 01:23:04,090
- Grab it!
- Yeah. I got it, I got it!

1491
01:23:04,520 --> 01:23:06,602
I got it. Yeah, I got it.

1492
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:11,171
You look a little nervous.
First time holding a gun?

1493
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:12,647
Nope.

1494
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:15,281
Motherfucker, freeze!

1495
01:23:15,560 --> 01:23:17,164
Before I pop yo ass!

1496
01:23:17,320 --> 01:23:18,481
"Pop"? Really?

1497
01:23:18,680 --> 01:23:21,251
I would listen to him.
This man's a dangerous felon.

1498
01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:25,001
Yeah, except when I ran his record,
it was the cleanest one I'd ever seen.

1499
01:23:25,720 --> 01:23:27,006
Not even a parking ticket.

1500
01:23:27,720 --> 01:23:29,768
- Yeah.
- What?

1501
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:32,446
You didn't know? Yeah.

1502
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:35,683
Stop clicking around and give me the gun.
Come on. Give me the gun.

1503
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:38,565
I think you have the safety on.

1504
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:40,525
Shit! Ow.

1505
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:42,166
Ugh.

1506
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:44,527
See? Safety's on.

1507
01:23:45,240 --> 01:23:46,287
Safety off.

1508
01:23:49,720 --> 01:23:52,246
Martin was right.
You are a lucky little shit.

1509
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:58,285
Don't give me reason to find you again.
Either of you.

1510
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:07,688
Don't you mad-dog me, James.

1511
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:11,128
Listen, listen,
I got some explaining to do. James!

1512
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:13,851
We can talk about this
after we go catch this guy.

1513
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:15,047
You traitor!

1514
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:17,646
- "Traitor"?
- Everything you taught me was a lie!

1515
01:24:18,040 --> 01:24:19,929
And now I'm fucked
beyond all fucktitude!

1516
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:23,163
My life's asshole is fucked!

1517
01:24:23,320 --> 01:24:26,130
You stop with your unorthodox style
of cussing!

1518
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:27,845
You just remember:

1519
01:24:28,040 --> 01:24:31,169
Whatever happens to me in there,
it's your fault!

1520
01:24:31,320 --> 01:24:32,845
Oh, stop. That's bullshit, man.

1521
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:36,681
Okay, I may have lied to you about going
to jail, but I did my job. I got you ready!

1522
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:37,927
Ready for what?!

1523
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:41,171
Maximum-bullshit prison?

1524
01:24:42,520 --> 01:24:44,682
I almost sucked a dick because of you!

1525
01:24:45,640 --> 01:24:47,051
I don't even give a shit.

1526
01:24:50,120 --> 01:24:51,929
It's my sign.

1527
01:24:59,960 --> 01:25:04,682
Now, the great thing about an IRA, if you need
the money for education or a first home...

1528
01:25:04,840 --> 01:25:07,366
...motherfuckers can make withdrawal
penalty-free.

1529
01:25:07,560 --> 01:25:11,804
I honestly don't get the difference
between Roth and the traditional IRAs.

1530
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,924
Fuck is wrong with you?
The shit is pretax.

1531
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:17,647
No, it's okay.
A lot of people get confused by that.

1532
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:19,729
This bitch is gonna mess around,
get us audited.

1533
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:22,526
- Say what you mean.
- You got five years' receipts, motherfucker?

1534
01:25:22,720 --> 01:25:25,644
And the strip club ain't no home office!

1535
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:27,529
That's a red flag, nigga!

1536
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:29,485
You big beanbag-build bitch!

1537
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:32,881
Stop it! You all friends! Right?

1538
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:36,000
Now JoJo, you might be right.

1539
01:25:36,160 --> 01:25:37,889
A strip club isn't a home office.

1540
01:25:38,040 --> 01:25:39,724
You're asking to be audited, son.

1541
01:25:40,760 --> 01:25:44,287
But is being right more important
than friendship? Huh?

1542
01:25:44,840 --> 01:25:46,365
Take it from me.

1543
01:25:46,640 --> 01:25:48,449
I lost my black friend.

1544
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:50,125
Don't lose yours.

1545
01:25:51,160 --> 01:25:52,321
Hug.

1546
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:55,402
Hug, motherfuckers!

1547
01:25:56,720 --> 01:25:58,848
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry, man.

1548
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:02,083
- I'll love you forever.
- Hey, bro, you know, it's just talk.

1549
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:04,443
Say, cos, you ready to get
put on the hood?

1550
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:06,284
I'm rolling.

1551
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:16,609
<i>Mayo, I need you to sink your mind
into this, cos.</i>

1552
01:26:17,200 --> 01:26:21,683
<i>Once you step through this threshold,
motherfuckers are ready to kill for you.</i>

1553
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:25,765
<i>I mean a whole fraternity of motherfuckers
gonna have your back.</i>

1554
01:26:27,080 --> 01:26:28,969
<i>But there's only one way out of this.</i>

1555
01:26:29,160 --> 01:26:31,731
<i>That's when your casket
drops into the ground.</i>

1556
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:33,720
<i>So from this day forward...</i>

1557
01:26:34,640 --> 01:26:36,802
<i>...you have eternal protection...</i>

1558
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:39,170
<i>...until your eternal demise.</i>

1559
01:26:40,440 --> 01:26:42,522
We dead-ass serious about what we do.

1560
01:26:43,160 --> 01:26:46,004
And if you go through that threshold
and you make it back...

1561
01:26:46,160 --> 01:26:48,401
...we gonna be dead-ass serious about you.

1562
01:26:49,400 --> 01:26:51,164
Time to smoke some fools.

1563
01:26:51,320 --> 01:26:53,482
Crenshaw Kings for life, motherfucker.

1564
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:55,762
Hmm. Almost.

1565
01:26:56,080 --> 01:26:57,320
Let's roll.

1566
01:27:00,040 --> 01:27:01,087
Hey.

1567
01:27:01,480 --> 01:27:02,720
You come back safe.

1568
01:27:02,920 --> 01:27:04,365
I will, Shonda.

1569
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:08,606
- We gotta go, Mayo.
- Bye, baby.

1570
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:10,171
Let's roll, cos.

1571
01:27:12,680 --> 01:27:14,808
Hold up! Oh, shit! Wait, wait, wait!

1572
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:16,405
Oh, wait, wait, wait!

1573
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:19,325
Hey! It's Darnell! It's Darnell!

1574
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:22,205
- It's Darnell!
- What the fuck are you doing here?

1575
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:24,687
Shit, cousin!
Man, tell them to put their guns down!

1576
01:27:24,880 --> 01:27:26,530
Man, put them up.

1577
01:27:28,520 --> 01:27:29,567
God!

1578
01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:32,331
What is your problem, man?
What are you doing?

1579
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:33,720
Man, give us a second.

1580
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:38,087
I'm blooding in. Crenshaw Kings
are gonna protect me on the inside.

1581
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:42,165
So you're gonna go and kill somebody, James?
Huh? Have you lost your fucking mind?

1582
01:27:42,520 --> 01:27:44,363
I have to. I don't have a choice.

1583
01:27:44,520 --> 01:27:45,681
That is not true.

1584
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:49,606
I came here to tell you
we can clear your name, James.

1585
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:51,330
But you gotta trust me, man.

1586
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:53,845
We gotta roll, Mayo.

1587
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:55,331
"Mayo"?

1588
01:27:55,480 --> 01:27:58,404
- Who the fuck is Mayo?
- I'm Mayo. It's my gang name.

1589
01:27:58,600 --> 01:28:01,524
It's short for "Mayonnaise"
on account of my skin color.

1590
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:02,921
I came up with that.

1591
01:28:03,360 --> 01:28:05,249
- Okay, you wanna go then?
- What?

1592
01:28:05,400 --> 01:28:06,845
- You wanna go?
- What are you doing?

1593
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:10,160
Putting fingerprints on your gun.
If you go to jail, I'm going to jail with you.

1594
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:14,644
So before you out there and make a stupid-ass
decision, why don't you think about that?

1595
01:28:17,200 --> 01:28:18,247
There you go.

1596
01:28:18,920 --> 01:28:21,207
That's it?
My fingerprints are off that easy?

1597
01:28:21,360 --> 01:28:23,044
Pretty much. Good as new.
Let's roll, Mayo.

1598
01:28:24,480 --> 01:28:28,041
James, you got a choice right now. You got
the right path, you got the wrong path.

1599
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:29,804
Make the right decision, James.

1600
01:28:30,080 --> 01:28:31,889
Follow your heart, man.

1601
01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:35,642
James, you gotta trust me on this one.

1602
01:28:43,440 --> 01:28:47,286
Oh, my God! I almost did it!
I almost killed a man!

1603
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:49,090
And I was gonna use this gun.

1604
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:51,965
James, put that away, man! Stop!

1605
01:28:54,200 --> 01:28:56,965
- What is your problem?
- I don't know.

1606
01:28:57,120 --> 01:28:59,930
They were just encouraging me...

1607
01:29:00,080 --> 01:29:01,525
...and they were high-fiving me.

1608
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:03,643
They're passing me this sticky icky.

1609
01:29:04,040 --> 01:29:06,361
And between the pot and the hos...

1610
01:29:06,520 --> 01:29:08,727
...it was just an ambrosia
of primal sensations.

1611
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:12,965
And for one brief moment,
I knew what my purpose was.

1612
01:29:13,120 --> 01:29:15,248
- Okay, okay.
- Not to mention Russell.

1613
01:29:15,400 --> 01:29:19,928
He's so charismatic. Real natural leader.
Reminds me of a young Ronald Reagan.

1614
01:29:21,240 --> 01:29:22,480
Hey...

1615
01:29:23,080 --> 01:29:25,048
Thank you for coming back for me.

1616
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:30,442
Thanks for not doing nothing stupid, man.
Let's get out of here.

1617
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:43,811
All right, so listen to this.

1618
01:29:43,960 --> 01:29:46,611
I figured out that the residue
on Martin's car was saltwater.

1619
01:29:46,760 --> 01:29:50,207
Then I remembered the mileage. I used to take
a picture of the odometer all the time...

1620
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:53,847
- ...to keep people from accusing me of joyriding.
- People do that? That's awful.

1621
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:58,005
Yeah, you did it like three times. You tried to
get me fired, but thought my name was Andre.

1622
01:29:58,200 --> 01:30:01,204
Anyway, Martin used to drive
the same exact seven miles every day.

1623
01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:04,443
But last week,
he started driving 56 miles every day.

1624
01:30:04,600 --> 01:30:07,410
Fifty-six! So, what I did was,
I checked the map.

1625
01:30:07,560 --> 01:30:10,723
Turns out that's the exact distance
of a round-trip to San Pedro.

1626
01:30:10,920 --> 01:30:13,491
Saltwater, ocean, San Pedro.

1627
01:30:13,640 --> 01:30:17,486
I just gotta figure out why he's going to
San Pedro. That's the only thing I don't know.

1628
01:30:17,680 --> 01:30:19,409
His yacht.

1629
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:20,931
It's docked at the port.

1630
01:30:21,080 --> 01:30:23,890
- Fucker's got a yacht?
- Mm-hm. And an island in Cape Verde...

1631
01:30:24,040 --> 01:30:27,806
- ...where there are no extradition laws.
- Fucker's got a yacht and a island, James?

1632
01:30:27,960 --> 01:30:30,361
Fucking working for a villain
in a James Bond movie!

1633
01:30:31,080 --> 01:30:32,809
He's gonna make a run for it.

1634
01:30:33,320 --> 01:30:35,004
Not if Mayo can stop him.

1635
01:30:36,520 --> 01:30:39,888
Mayo and Chocolat.

1636
01:30:40,040 --> 01:30:41,849
- "Chocolat"?
- Chocolat.

1637
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:45,288
- Is that supposed to be my nickname?
- That's your nickname.

1638
01:30:46,840 --> 01:30:49,241
I'll do better. We have the whole car ride.

1639
01:30:50,360 --> 01:30:52,522
Mayo and Coffee.

1640
01:30:52,680 --> 01:30:54,364
Mayo and Fudge.

1641
01:30:54,520 --> 01:30:57,763
- I don't want one. Just call me Darnell.
- Hit it, Fudge!

1642
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:11,607
<i>There it is. There's his boat.
The <I?>Sea Note.</i>

1643
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:15,406
The <i>Sea Note?</i> What a <i>dick.</i>

1644
01:31:15,960 --> 01:31:17,485
Come on.

1645
01:31:19,320 --> 01:31:21,129
Get down, James. You gotta get down.

1646
01:31:22,920 --> 01:31:24,809
- Are those guards?
- I think so.

1647
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:26,680
- There's a lot of them.
- Yeah.

1648
01:31:27,560 --> 01:31:28,607
There's the computer.

1649
01:31:30,280 --> 01:31:31,406
I see it.

1650
01:31:34,440 --> 01:31:36,010
James, you gotta get low!

1651
01:31:43,200 --> 01:31:47,091
- Oh, no. They're getting ready to leave.
- Shit. We gotta jump.

1652
01:31:47,480 --> 01:31:48,811
All right.

1653
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:51,167
- Get off my hand!
- Sorry, I'm nervous.

1654
01:31:51,480 --> 01:31:52,641
Let's go!

1655
01:31:58,640 --> 01:32:00,244
Darnell! I made it!

1656
01:32:06,880 --> 01:32:08,723
Let go of my face!

1657
01:32:09,040 --> 01:32:11,361
- That's all you, James. All you, James!
- Aah!

1658
01:32:35,160 --> 01:32:37,686
Okay. Come on, this way.

1659
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:45,409
There it is.

1660
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:49,530
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.
Oh, shit!

1661
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:55,890
Get off! Get off!

1662
01:32:56,160 --> 01:32:57,207
Get off.

1663
01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:00,040
Dammit.

1664
01:33:01,520 --> 01:33:02,885
This is the end, guys.

1665
01:33:03,440 --> 01:33:04,521
You going down.

1666
01:33:06,040 --> 01:33:08,407
That's great.
I spend my whole life in Crenshaw...

1667
01:33:08,600 --> 01:33:11,729
...and now I'm about to get killed
by some white guy from Beverly Hills?

1668
01:33:11,880 --> 01:33:13,928
- On a yacht!
- I'm so sorry.

1669
01:33:14,080 --> 01:33:15,650
Hand over the computer, James.

1670
01:33:15,800 --> 01:33:17,882
Come on.
Just can't get it through your head?

1671
01:33:18,040 --> 01:33:21,408
Guys like you will always be the fall guy
because you're weak.

1672
01:33:27,280 --> 01:33:28,691
Are you okay?

1673
01:33:28,840 --> 01:33:32,083
James? James. No. James, please.

1674
01:33:32,240 --> 01:33:34,447
Goddamn, James.
Please, please, James.

1675
01:33:34,600 --> 01:33:38,082
I sentence you to 10 years
in a maximum security prison.

1676
01:33:38,240 --> 01:33:39,480
You about to get this:

1677
01:33:39,680 --> 01:33:41,762
Oh, they be fucking in San Quentin.

1678
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:43,843
- In this house?
- Mouth full of balls.

1679
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:45,604
- Come back, Mayo.
- Take it all.

1680
01:33:45,800 --> 01:33:48,280
When life puts a dick in your mouth,
you make dickade.

1681
01:33:48,440 --> 01:33:49,930
Go suck a dick.

1682
01:33:50,280 --> 01:33:51,805
Your capoeira's strong!

1683
01:33:51,960 --> 01:33:54,440
Now you must bring your power
into the world.

1684
01:33:58,920 --> 01:34:01,082
What? James. What are you doing?

1685
01:34:01,280 --> 01:34:02,964
I've been pushed around for too long.

1686
01:34:03,280 --> 01:34:05,726
Now it is time. I can feel it.

1687
01:34:05,960 --> 01:34:07,928
- Time for what, James?
- Protect the computer!

1688
01:34:08,280 --> 01:34:10,123
Shit! I don't want the computer!

1689
01:34:10,720 --> 01:34:12,085
<i>Bênção</i> kick!

1690
01:34:21,200 --> 01:34:22,247
Oh, God!

1691
01:34:25,520 --> 01:34:26,601
Oh, shit!

1692
01:34:28,720 --> 01:34:30,802
Leave me alone! Stop! No!

1693
01:34:31,880 --> 01:34:33,644
James! James!

1694
01:34:45,880 --> 01:34:47,644
All right, get down there. Come on.

1695
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:03,406
Mayo and Chocolat, motherfuckers!

1696
01:35:03,560 --> 01:35:06,723
Aah! James, you mean to tell me
you could do this shit the whole time?

1697
01:35:06,880 --> 01:35:09,850
Capoeira must never be used
unless capoeira is required.

1698
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:11,047
Let's go.

1699
01:35:12,840 --> 01:35:14,683
Motherfuckers!

1700
01:35:17,120 --> 01:35:19,805
Okay! Okay!

1701
01:35:22,840 --> 01:35:24,330
Come here!

1702
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:26,802
That's what we do!

1703
01:35:27,920 --> 01:35:29,046
Mother...! Get off!

1704
01:35:32,360 --> 01:35:33,361
James.

1705
01:35:34,360 --> 01:35:36,124
Do like we used to do in the yard.

1706
01:35:37,800 --> 01:35:39,529
Yeah! You got it, James.

1707
01:35:40,240 --> 01:35:43,210
Fuck yeah, James. Get his ass, James.

1708
01:35:50,760 --> 01:35:51,886
God.

1709
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:56,041
I got the computer.

1710
01:35:56,200 --> 01:35:57,565
- Lifeboat. Come on.
- All right.

1711
01:35:57,720 --> 01:35:59,961
Hey, that capoeira shit was amazing.

1712
01:36:00,120 --> 01:36:03,044
But you learned some of that shit
from me too. Right, James?

1713
01:36:03,360 --> 01:36:06,409
James. What's going on here?
What the hell did you do to my boat?

1714
01:36:06,560 --> 01:36:07,686
Man, fuck this boat!

1715
01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:11,049
We taking the evidence that you framed
your son-in-law with, sick son of a bitch.

1716
01:36:11,240 --> 01:36:13,925
How could you do this to me, Martin?
Ten years in prison?

1717
01:36:14,120 --> 01:36:16,566
James, you realize
that I didn't mean to hurt you.

1718
01:36:16,720 --> 01:36:19,087
I'm very fond of you,
but Himalayan Tiger tanked...

1719
01:36:19,240 --> 01:36:23,450
...and I had to get the money from somewhere.
I had no choice. It was you or me.

1720
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:25,125
That sounds like a choice!

1721
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:28,409
James, fuck him. We're leaving.

1722
01:36:28,560 --> 01:36:31,769
And next time you wanna store
some fraud shit, get an iPad.

1723
01:36:31,920 --> 01:36:32,921
Come on, James.

1724
01:36:34,240 --> 01:36:36,163
- Oh, my damn.
- Alissa.

1725
01:36:36,360 --> 01:36:39,887
- James. Daddy, what's he doing here?
- It's fine, honey.

1726
01:36:40,240 --> 01:36:41,287
Uh, James.

1727
01:36:41,480 --> 01:36:45,121
I have a wonderful idea.
Why don't you come with us?

1728
01:36:45,440 --> 01:36:49,331
We'll start a whole new life in Cape Verde
and nobody has to go to prison.

1729
01:36:49,480 --> 01:36:50,686
Don't you want...

1730
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:54,521
...a big, big island?

1731
01:36:55,880 --> 01:36:58,451
- Were you in on this?
- No, not at first.

1732
01:36:58,600 --> 01:37:01,683
And when he told me about it,
I was really mad at him.

1733
01:37:01,880 --> 01:37:04,770
But then he explained how he was able
to hide most of the money...

1734
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:06,450
...so, really, there's no harm done.

1735
01:37:06,640 --> 01:37:11,123
James, now there's still time
to get everything you want.

1736
01:37:11,800 --> 01:37:13,609
Everything.

1737
01:37:14,280 --> 01:37:16,965
No! I don't want any of it.

1738
01:37:17,960 --> 01:37:20,281
- And you got a white girl's ass.
- Ah!

1739
01:37:20,440 --> 01:37:24,729
Thattaboy. Hey, James, do you wanna
switch off, man? I got nothing left up top.

1740
01:37:27,120 --> 01:37:30,647
- Quick, throw it in the Zodiac.
- Right. Then we can get the fuck out of here.

1741
01:37:32,320 --> 01:37:35,210
- Shit! Goddamn it!
- Aah!

1742
01:37:35,800 --> 01:37:38,804
I am genuinely sorry it
had to end this way.

1743
01:37:38,960 --> 01:37:41,327
When we clear the breakwater, shoot them.

1744
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:43,729
You ain't got to do this, man.

1745
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:46,005
You ain't got to do this.

1746
01:37:46,160 --> 01:37:50,051
Well, Dad, looks like you thought
of everything, didn't you?

1747
01:37:50,560 --> 01:37:52,642
You were always one step ahead of me.

1748
01:37:53,720 --> 01:37:56,166
Except you forgot one little detail.

1749
01:38:01,160 --> 01:38:02,321
Where'd that come from?

1750
01:38:02,520 --> 01:38:04,522
First rule in prison pat-downs:

1751
01:38:04,680 --> 01:38:06,728
Always check the anus.

1752
01:38:08,160 --> 01:38:09,685
Someone learned how to keister.

1753
01:38:09,840 --> 01:38:13,401
- Ew.
- That's right. Nuts and butts.

1754
01:38:14,840 --> 01:38:17,081
You point? Okay.
That's how you wanna do it?

1755
01:38:17,280 --> 01:38:18,884
You point at him. I'll point at Martin.

1756
01:38:19,040 --> 01:38:20,849
Either way. So if I die, Martin's going.

1757
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:24,049
So you figure it out.
Shoot me, Martin gets shot.

1758
01:38:24,640 --> 01:38:25,846
Ball's in your court, Gayle.

1759
01:38:26,080 --> 01:38:28,128
- Alissa?
- Shoot her.

1760
01:38:28,280 --> 01:38:30,681
Shoot her.
You need to shoot that bitch anyway.

1761
01:38:30,880 --> 01:38:32,041
You're not gonna shoot me.

1762
01:38:32,360 --> 01:38:34,727
You're wasting time.
Police'll be here any second.

1763
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:37,360
That's right.
We're talking the real police.

1764
01:38:37,520 --> 01:38:40,285
The ones that's gonna come here
on boats with sirens on them...

1765
01:38:40,480 --> 01:38:42,881
...that's got dogs that can swim. Let me
tell you something about swimming dogs.

1766
01:38:43,040 --> 01:38:45,646
Now, let me tell you,
you're gonna bullshit a bullshitter...

1767
01:38:45,800 --> 01:38:47,768
...just make the bullshit plausible.

1768
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:50,810
<i>This is the U. S. Marshall Service.
Prepare to be boarded.</i>

1769
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:52,570
<i>You are carrying a fugitive.</i>

1770
01:38:54,040 --> 01:38:55,405
Yes!

1771
01:38:55,560 --> 01:38:56,607
Heh. Hell yeah.

1772
01:38:56,760 --> 01:38:58,000
Oh, shit.

1773
01:38:59,240 --> 01:39:00,287
How?

1774
01:39:01,560 --> 01:39:04,404
Remember this bracelet
that crooked lawyer of yours gave me?

1775
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:07,962
By my calculation
we should be well outside the county line.

1776
01:39:08,920 --> 01:39:10,922
Prison school's in session, bitch.

1777
01:39:11,960 --> 01:39:13,803
And somebody just graduated.

1778
01:39:13,960 --> 01:39:15,450
That's perfect. That's perfect.

1779
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:16,931
That's great, right?

1780
01:39:17,080 --> 01:39:19,560
<i>Attention Sea Note.
This is the U.S. Marshal Service.</i>

1781
01:39:19,760 --> 01:39:22,240
- Where you going? Huh, Martin?
- Where you going?

1782
01:39:22,600 --> 01:39:23,931
What?!

1783
01:39:24,080 --> 01:39:25,764
- Look at you, man!
- I know.

1784
01:39:25,920 --> 01:39:27,160
God, look at you!

1785
01:39:27,320 --> 01:39:30,802
Where did you put...? That was in your ass.
That was in your ass.

1786
01:39:31,280 --> 01:39:33,442
<i>The computer proved I was innocent.</i>

1787
01:39:33,600 --> 01:39:37,650
<i>Martin was arrested for fraud, tampering
with evidence and obstruction of justice.</i>

1788
01:39:37,800 --> 01:39:40,724
And I will be contacting my attorney. Daddy?

1789
01:39:40,880 --> 01:39:44,680
<i>As for me, I was cleared of all
charges related to the embezzlement.</i>

1790
01:39:44,920 --> 01:39:46,285
So I guess we did it.

1791
01:39:46,440 --> 01:39:48,090
Mayo and Chocolate.

1792
01:39:48,240 --> 01:39:51,164
- Heh.
- Thank God we won't be needing this anymore.

1793
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:53,283
This illegal, unlicensed gun.

1794
01:39:53,440 --> 01:39:56,444
- Okay, you should really get rid of that thing.
- Gun!

1795
01:39:57,040 --> 01:39:58,644
- Drop it!
- Oh, shit.

1796
01:40:00,680 --> 01:40:04,082
<i>I did end up getting six months
for carrying an unlicensed weapon.</i>

1797
01:40:06,080 --> 01:40:07,844
<i>But, thanks to Darnell, I was ready.</i>

1798
01:40:08,680 --> 01:40:11,650
<i>Prison is like life distilled
to its purest form.</i>

1799
01:40:11,800 --> 01:40:14,690
<i>Give respect to get respect.</i>

1800
01:40:17,320 --> 01:40:23,441
<i>But most of all, if you let someone fuck
with your food, you're a punk fuck bitch.</i>

1801
01:40:24,280 --> 01:40:26,851
Someone should have told you
this Mayo went bad.

1802
01:40:27,080 --> 01:40:28,809
I'm gonna punch you in the fuck!

1803
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:30,126
I'm gonna shit you!

1804
01:40:30,280 --> 01:40:32,408
Merry Dickmas, Santa Cock!

1805
01:40:34,240 --> 01:40:37,562
<i>Martin didn't do as well.
But he learned a valuable lesson too.</i>

1806
01:40:38,840 --> 01:40:42,003
<i>They be fucking in San Quentin.</i>

1807
01:40:42,160 --> 01:40:44,162
- How ya doing?
<i>- A whole lot of fucking.</i>

1808
01:40:44,320 --> 01:40:45,367
Hey! Open up. Open up.

1809
01:40:50,680 --> 01:40:53,286
<i>Shonda visited me every day.</i>

1810
01:40:54,080 --> 01:40:57,129
<i>I never thought prison would be the place
I learned to love again...</i>

1811
01:40:57,320 --> 01:40:58,924
<i>...but that's what happened.</i>

1812
01:40:59,080 --> 01:41:02,801
No, no, no!
She's not done. She hasn't finished yet.

1813
01:41:03,160 --> 01:41:05,561
No, it's not what you think.
We're in love.

1814
01:41:06,120 --> 01:41:10,603
<i>I helped the FBI find and return
all the assets Martin stole.</i>

1815
01:41:10,760 --> 01:41:15,607
<i>In return, they unfroze my bank accounts,
and I knew just where to invest my money.</i>

1816
01:41:24,080 --> 01:41:25,286
It's good?

1817
01:41:25,640 --> 01:41:26,801
It's good, right?

1818
01:41:26,960 --> 01:41:28,883
Makayla, you proud of Daddy?

1819
01:41:29,120 --> 01:41:30,963
Daddy did good? Give me a hug.

1820
01:41:34,960 --> 01:41:37,008
Daddy, I like your car wash.

1821
01:41:37,160 --> 01:41:39,128
I'm glad you like it, sweetie.

1822
01:41:57,480 --> 01:41:59,164
I see you survived.

1823
01:41:59,320 --> 01:42:01,209
I guess you got hard, Mayo.

1824
01:42:01,480 --> 01:42:03,926
No. You made me hard.

1825
01:42:04,120 --> 01:42:06,487
Come here, man. Heh.

1826
01:42:06,680 --> 01:42:07,966
Aah!

1827
01:42:08,120 --> 01:42:09,929
You made me hard.

1828
01:42:10,680 --> 01:42:12,170
So hard.

1829
01:42:13,720 --> 01:42:15,085
You got me so hard.

1830
01:42:15,240 --> 01:42:18,084
I'm happy to see you too, big fella.
I'm happy to see you.

1831
01:42:18,240 --> 01:42:20,766
There was a moment
where I stopped being hard...

1832
01:42:20,920 --> 01:42:24,288
...but I thought of you,
and it got me hard again.

1833
01:42:25,120 --> 01:42:26,849
And I can't ever thank you.

1834
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:28,161
All right.

1835
01:42:29,560 --> 01:42:32,450
Welcome home, man.
Come on, let's get in the car.

1836
01:42:32,640 --> 01:42:34,244
You look good, James.

1837
01:42:39,760 --> 01:42:42,889
Welcome back to the free world, James.
How you wanna celebrate?

1838
01:42:43,040 --> 01:42:46,886
You know what I'd like to get my hands on?
A <i>Wall Street Journal</i> and a 40.

1839
01:42:47,040 --> 01:42:49,168
Now that'd be a perfect Sunday morning.
