1
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:29,042
Can't you call in sick and tell them
you have a doctor's appointment?

2
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,333
And l'll make it worth your while.

3
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:38,000
You do make it hard.

4
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:41,833
Received a call yesterday...

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,417
...and got a lead
on some bookie joints opening up.

6
00:00:44,667 --> 00:00:46,000
Should be a pretty dull day...

7
00:00:46,125 --> 00:00:49,167
...so l will be home by 6.

8
00:00:51,417 --> 00:00:53,625
-You are gonna make me late.
-l am not.

9
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:55,000
l gotta go.

10
00:00:55,042 --> 00:00:58,875
-Oh, no, please?
-Get off.

11
00:00:59,667 --> 00:01:00,875
l gotta go.

12
00:01:01,083 --> 00:01:03,000
-Come on.
-No, l don't want you to. Please?

13
00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:04,458
-Got to.
-No.

14
00:01:04,583 --> 00:01:06,917
-Got to. Got to.
-No. No.

15
00:01:16,458 --> 00:01:17,792
Oh, yeah.

16
00:01:19,375 --> 00:01:20,917
You're beautiful.

17
00:01:28,625 --> 00:01:31,083
Good morning, Los Angeles.
It's 6.:30 a.m.

18
00:01:31,333 --> 00:01:33,000
The temperature
is a cool 49 degrees.

19
00:01:33,292 --> 00:01:35,458
The traffic is already starting
to become heavy.

20
00:01:35,708 --> 00:01:37,958
A shootout tool place
in South Compton last night...

21
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,000
... leaving a 26-year-old male dead.

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,708
In a statement issued
by the police...

23
00:01:41,958 --> 00:01:45,125
... the shooting has been blamed
on the violence between two gangs...

24
00:01:45,292 --> 00:01:46,875
...Hyde Parl
and East Side Gangsters...

25
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:49,708
... who have been the focus
of the mayor's commitment.

26
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:50,583
-Come on.
-What's up, man?

27
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:54,333
Shit.

28
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,458
-Shut up. Stay still.
-l ain't did nothing.

29
00:03:01,667 --> 00:03:03,458
Stay right there. Come on.

30
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:05,167
Get down.

31
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:07,333
Get down.

32
00:03:10,042 --> 00:03:11,625
What the fuck?

33
00:03:21,542 --> 00:03:22,667
All right.

34
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,333
Let's get out of here.

35
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:35,333
Hey, check it out.

36
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:37,958
Oh, shit.

37
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,333
All right, let's go.

38
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,667
All right, let's go.

39
00:03:56,792 --> 00:03:59,000
Ron and Schrulner.

40
00:04:00,292 --> 00:04:03,250
l always had my suspicions.

41
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:08,125
But who are you?

42
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:13,958
Come on.

43
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,375
Hello.

44
00:04:28,917 --> 00:04:30,625
What, now?

45
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:35,583
This better be important.

46
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:38,583
l'll be there in 20.

47
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:43,833
-Damn it.
-What's wrong?

48
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,833
l gotta go get somebody.

49
00:04:47,542 --> 00:04:49,958
-l'll be less than an hour.
-Dinner's almost ready.

50
00:04:50,042 --> 00:04:53,250
l know, l know, l'll make it quick.
Promise.

51
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:56,000
-l guess l'll keep a plate warm for you.
-Thanks.

52
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:20,625
Come on, Gary, it's cold.

53
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,458
Linda's gonna have my ass.

54
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,292
Hello.

55
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,000
Hello.

56
00:06:20,042 --> 00:06:24,250
Ready. Aim. Fire.

57
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:28,417
Ready. Aim. Fire.

58
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:31,125
Ready. Aim. Fire.

59
00:06:43,542 --> 00:06:47,333
Max Ballister is a hero.

60
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:54,000
He gave his life in the line of duty
with courage and conviction.

61
00:06:54,167 --> 00:06:59,833
His loss will forever
be remembered by everyone.

62
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Simon, the police say
it was a random gang shooting.

63
00:08:15,167 --> 00:08:17,750
They may never know who did it.

64
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,167
l won't accept that option, Simon.

65
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,417
Someone murdered Max.

66
00:08:28,167 --> 00:08:30,333
Someone shot him in cold blood.

67
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,917
lf you come by the house,
l have copies of the police reports...

68
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,292
...they would release to me.

69
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:41,333
Along with Max's personal items.

70
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:07,542
-Yo.
-Hello.

71
00:09:37,042 --> 00:09:38,583
Can l help you?

72
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,000
Sign says room for rent.

73
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:42,750
l have a few apartments
available upstairs.

74
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
This the kind of place
you're looking for?

75
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:46,458
Can l see the room?

76
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:48,375
Yeah.

77
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:52,417
Follow me.

78
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:00,042
So they're not exactly
the Four Seasons...

79
00:10:00,042 --> 00:10:02,958
...but they're cheap,
and they rent by the week.

80
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:08,958
lt comes furnished.

81
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,667
Change your mind?

82
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:12,958
No, it's perfect.

83
00:10:13,167 --> 00:10:16,292
All right. Well, l'm gonna need
the first week in advance.

84
00:10:16,417 --> 00:10:18,125
Yeah, that's no problem.

85
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:20,750
Cop was killed not far from here
the other day.

86
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,167
Know anything about that?

87
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:24,542
Like l said,
this isn't the best neighbourhood.

88
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:29,000
-ln fact, it's getting worse by the week.
-Yeah.

89
00:10:29,042 --> 00:10:31,292
That cop was my son.

90
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,792
Oh, l'm sorry.

91
00:10:33,917 --> 00:10:35,250
How much you say l owe you?

92
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:37,542
One twenty-five.

93
00:10:37,667 --> 00:10:39,667
By the way, l'm Simon Ballister.

94
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:40,917
l'm Alice Park.

95
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,708
-Nice to meet you.
-You too.

96
00:10:47,667 --> 00:10:51,000
-Can l help you?
-This is my 'hood, pendejo.

97
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,625
You don't fucking belong here.

98
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:54,708
Really?

99
00:10:54,917 --> 00:10:58,292
Listen, l got some personal stuff going
on that makes me have to be here...

100
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,917
...so why don't you take
your lively, chubby ass...

101
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,458
...and get the fuck off my car?

102
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:04,000
lt's my fucking 'hood.

103
00:11:04,042 --> 00:11:07,167
l'm starting to get scared.
l'm starting to get scared.

104
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,958
Come on, rob me.

105
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:19,750
Kung fu this, motherfucker.

106
00:11:40,042 --> 00:11:41,958
Tell every motherfucker
they're not safe...

107
00:11:42,042 --> 00:11:44,417
...till l find the motherfucker
who killed my son.

108
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,583
You understand me?

109
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,750
Tell them. Tell them what l said.

110
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:05,042
l'm gonna get that guy.

111
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:17,333
How can l help you?

112
00:13:17,542 --> 00:13:20,833
l'm Simon Ballister,
Max's father.

113
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,417
He was murdered last week...

114
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:25,333
...and l'd like to speak
with the officer in charge.

115
00:13:25,542 --> 00:13:27,708
l'm sorry. Max was a good man.

116
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:30,833
Highly respected officer
in this department.

117
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,333
detective Shaw is heading up his case.
l'll let him know you're here.

118
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,000
Simon Ballister,
Max's father, here to see you.

119
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Thank you, send him in.

120
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:47,250
-Right back this way, Mr. Ballister.
-Thank you.

121
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:51,083
l know, l know,
that's what he told me.

122
00:13:52,167 --> 00:13:54,000
Hello, Mr. Ballister.
l'm detective Shaw.

123
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:55,958
Nice to meet you.

124
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:58,125
Nice to meet you.
A little privacy please?

125
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:01,417
-Yeah.
-Please, have a seat.

126
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:09,583
Well, l didn't mean
to bother you or anything...

127
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:13,000
...but l just wanna see if there's
any updates, you know, intel...

128
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:14,708
...on my son's case.

129
00:14:15,042 --> 00:14:17,542
-As l explained to your wife--
-You mean my ex-wife.

130
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:18,792
Ex-wife.

131
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:22,417
--the chances of finding
your son's killer are slim to none.

132
00:14:22,542 --> 00:14:24,750
He was one of ours,
we don't take that lightly...

133
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:27,250
...but it looks like
it was a random gang shooting.

134
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:32,083
lt's kind of disappointing to see
that kind of confidence...

135
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:34,000
...from my son's own team,
you know?

136
00:14:34,042 --> 00:14:36,875
l understand. Unfortunately,
the numbers worked against us.

137
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,833
Last year,
we had 487 homicides...

138
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
...almost half of which
were gang related.

139
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:43,708
Good news is, that's down 6 percent
from the year before.

140
00:14:43,917 --> 00:14:47,083
does that mean you have
no evidence whatsoever?

141
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:49,292
He was found in the street
next to his car.

142
00:14:49,667 --> 00:14:51,000
A random shooting.

143
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:53,167
Killer probably never
stepped out of the car.

144
00:14:53,417 --> 00:14:56,000
All we do have is the bullet,
which we recovered from him.

145
00:14:56,292 --> 00:14:58,458
-What calibre was that?
-Forty.

146
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:01,583
Mr. Ballister, he was
a well-respected officer.

147
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:03,167
We were all very fond of him.

148
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:07,833
Listen, would you mind if l give you
a call now and again?

149
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:10,000
Not at all. Here's my card.

150
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:13,833
did you ever get the chance
to meet my son?

151
00:15:14,042 --> 00:15:15,417
No, wish l had.

152
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:17,333
Unfortunately,
our paths never crossed.

153
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:19,208
He worl ed Vice,
out of headquarters.

154
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:21,708
l've been assigned here
since l pinned on a badge.

155
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,292
-Here you go, sir.
-Thank you.

156
00:15:23,417 --> 00:15:26,083
Thank you.
Pleasure meeting you.

157
00:15:33,417 --> 00:15:35,333
detective Shaw.

158
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:37,375
Hello?

159
00:16:04,417 --> 00:16:06,333
-Holy shit, man.
-What's up, man?

160
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,958
What's up, man?

161
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:10,000
l came here looking for you.
That's it.

162
00:16:10,042 --> 00:16:11,417
-For me?
-Yeah.

163
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,750
l ain't trying to rob no one, man.
Come on, man.

164
00:16:13,917 --> 00:16:17,958
For real, man. l heard you was asking
questions, man. That's about it, man.

165
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:20,667
Come here.

166
00:16:20,917 --> 00:16:23,458
Sit down. Sit down.

167
00:16:25,292 --> 00:16:26,625
Man.

168
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:29,167
So, what's your name?

169
00:16:29,917 --> 00:16:32,000
Gary, man. Gary Morrison.

170
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:33,417
What are you doing here?

171
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,625
l just came here to ask you
a couple questions.

172
00:16:36,917 --> 00:16:39,875
l heard you was asking about Max.
Max Ballister.

173
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:41,833
did you know my son?

174
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:47,042
l mean, l ran numbers,
Max, he worked Vice, so....

175
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:50,208
You know, times came,
l helped him out with a couple tips...

176
00:16:50,292 --> 00:16:52,958
...on a few local joints in the area,
and things like that.

177
00:16:53,292 --> 00:16:55,000
l got you. So you're a snitch.

178
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:58,667
Man, that's a rude term, man.
l was a Cl, all right?

179
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:00,500
l was a confidential informant.

180
00:17:00,667 --> 00:17:02,833
ln other words, you're a snitch.

181
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:04,667
You a cop too?

182
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:07,083
Not exactly.

183
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,250
You Simon.

184
00:17:10,917 --> 00:17:14,375
See, Max-- Yeah, man.
Max, he mentioned you couple times.

185
00:17:14,542 --> 00:17:16,917
Hey, look, man,
l don't know you that well, man...

186
00:17:16,917 --> 00:17:20,208
...but the East Side Gangsters,
they run this neighbourhood.

187
00:17:20,292 --> 00:17:23,333
-ls that right?
-l mean, you stick around, like:

188
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:25,750
Like, they'll probably kill you.

189
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Before all them bad things
happen to me...

190
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,917
...maybe you could tell me
where they are.

191
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,708
They stay over in the projects
on Florence.

192
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:39,958
-On Florence?
-lt's a closed construction site now...

193
00:17:40,042 --> 00:17:41,708
...but that's where Max was shot.

194
00:17:42,542 --> 00:17:45,625
Like l said, it ain't a good idea for you
to go nowhere near there.

195
00:17:45,667 --> 00:17:49,042
l really don't care
what their business is.

196
00:17:49,167 --> 00:17:52,000
l just want the motherfucker
that killed my son.

197
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,625
l understand, man.

198
00:17:53,792 --> 00:17:56,083
Like l said, Max,
he was a good guy, man.

199
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:01,542
l mean.... l don't know,
l gots to go, man.

200
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:12,625
Hey, man, look,
l'm sorry about Max, man.

201
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:15,708
Yeah, me too.

202
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,917
So, what are you thinking?

203
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,583
-lt's Gary.
-Gary doesn't have the balls.

204
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:35,333
Think about it. Now, his brother lsaiah
is trying to work his way up.

205
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:37,375
Killing Max could have been
his ticket.

206
00:18:37,542 --> 00:18:40,833
-Let's take him down, then.
-Timing's not right.

207
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:43,458
We'll take him down
when we take down Armand.

208
00:19:47,792 --> 00:19:48,958
Knock, knock, nigga.

209
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:54,875
What the fuck's your bitch ass
doing off in here?

210
00:19:57,833 --> 00:19:59,250
Looks like your luck just ran out.

211
00:19:59,417 --> 00:20:02,042
You know what, man?
Luck is a funny motherfucking thing.

212
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:03,625
Oh, why's that?

213
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:07,000
Luck can change in the blink
of a motherfucking eye.

214
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:24,833
You're a badass white boy, huh?

215
00:20:32,292 --> 00:20:33,583
Think you bad, huh?

216
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:39,708
Come on, motherfucker. You--

217
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,708
Motherfucker, you wanna tell me
who killed my son?

218
00:21:02,167 --> 00:21:03,417
Man, l don't know shit.

219
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:05,292
You don't know shit, huh?

220
00:21:05,417 --> 00:21:07,958
-Who killed my son?
-Nigga, fuck you.

221
00:21:08,292 --> 00:21:09,917

222
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,667
-Man, fuck y'all.
-What'd you say?

223
00:21:12,917 --> 00:21:14,833
Fuck you. l don't know shit.

224
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:20,667
Shit! Man, in my fucking ear.

225
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:25,500
-Fuck. l'm gonna smoke your ass.
-l'm gonna ask you one more time.

226
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:28,458
Hey, all right, look.
l'll get you some knowledge, all right?

227
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:31,250
-Shot my fucking ear off.
-Who killed my son?

228
00:21:31,417 --> 00:21:35,292
-lt wasn't who you think it is, all right?
-lt ain't who l think? What's that mean?

229
00:21:35,417 --> 00:21:37,833
-Nigga, it wasn't us.
-Shit. You motherfucker...

230
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,833
...l'm gonna get your ass.
Bitch, you're dead, bitch.

231
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,292
l got nothing but time for you.
don't forget that.

232
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:45,250
You shot my fucking ear.

233
00:21:45,417 --> 00:21:47,167
Oh, fuck.

234
00:21:47,417 --> 00:21:51,000
l'm gonna get your fucking ass.
Oh, shit.

235
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:53,292
Benny, what's your problem?

236
00:21:53,542 --> 00:21:56,417
Armand, why are we playing
these games?

237
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:59,667
Well, Benny, l like games.

238
00:22:00,042 --> 00:22:01,333
l've got a game we can play.

239
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:06,167
lt's got one question:
Why are you a snitch?

240
00:22:07,042 --> 00:22:09,875
-No, l'm not a snitch.
-That ain't what l heard.

241
00:22:10,042 --> 00:22:13,333
You should be working for CNN
the way you put my business out.

242
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:16,458
Armand, look at what l gave you.

243
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,292
There's a major deal
going down...

244
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:22,375
...and l risked my life to bring you
this information because l respect you.

245
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:25,000
Because l wanna do business
with you.

246
00:22:26,708 --> 00:22:28,958
l wanna do business
with you too, Benny.

247
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,750
-Let me cut this cheque for you.
-Thank you.

248
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,875
You should know
nigga's cheque's gonna bounce.

249
00:22:43,542 --> 00:22:45,042
What the fuck are you doing?

250
00:22:45,167 --> 00:22:48,625
Oh, my bad.
l didn't like the way he smelled.

251
00:22:50,333 --> 00:22:51,542
All right, look.

252
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:55,458
l've got most of the information
on the deal he was brokering.

253
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:58,625
-l'll keep you informed.
-Oh, the fuck you will.

254
00:22:58,667 --> 00:23:01,500
You let me know when and where,
me and my boys will be there.

255
00:23:01,708 --> 00:23:04,667
Like l said,
l will keep you informed.

256
00:23:06,125 --> 00:23:07,750
What the hell

257
00:23:08,917 --> 00:23:11,458
Man, some big-ass white boy
jumped us.

258
00:23:11,542 --> 00:23:12,708
A white boy.

259
00:23:13,292 --> 00:23:15,458
-What?
-Nigga, are you deaf?

260
00:23:15,625 --> 00:23:18,000
Yeah, man. That nigga is.

261
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:20,750
Look, some big-ass white boy...

263
00:23:24,708 --> 00:23:27,500
...did some kung fu shit

264
00:23:27,708 --> 00:23:29,750
...grabbed that nigga's gun
and shot his ear.

265
00:23:29,917 --> 00:23:31,458
-Nigga, please.
-What?

266
00:23:32,167 --> 00:23:33,625
Hey, take it easy, all right?

267
00:23:33,958 --> 00:23:35,625
Just put the gun down. Relax.

268
00:23:37,542 --> 00:23:39,083
Where's Maurice and Anthony?

269
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:42,083
Man, them niggas gone, man.
He smoked both them fools.

270
00:23:42,583 --> 00:23:45,042
-One dude?
-Yeah.

271
00:23:45,042 --> 00:23:47,208
One dude smoked
two of my motherfuckers?

272
00:23:47,333 --> 00:23:50,000
What are y'all, bitches?
do l have to buy y'all dresses?

273
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,500
You niggas want miniskirts, tutus?

274
00:23:52,667 --> 00:23:56,125

and put you in roller skates, bitch?

275
00:23:56,458 --> 00:23:59,708

276
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:02,917
-...or Bollister or some shit--
-Ballister did this to you?

277
00:24:02,958 --> 00:24:05,167
Yeah, that's that nigga, right.
Yeah, Ballister.

278
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:07,167
Fuck. The guy
l was telling you about.

279
00:24:07,292 --> 00:24:10,000
You knew this motherfucker
was gonna do shit like this?

280
00:24:10,167 --> 00:24:13,000
l got a lot of money
on this deal, partner.

281
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:15,917
Ain't got time for this bullshit.

282
00:24:16,042 --> 00:24:19,333
-Clean that motherfucker up.
-Come on, man.

283
00:24:22,083 --> 00:24:24,083
Yeah, l can see
what you're thinking, Benny.

284
00:24:24,333 --> 00:24:26,042
You had deceit on your mind.

285
00:24:26,292 --> 00:24:29,042
Think you're gonna take
a brother down?

286
00:24:30,042 --> 00:24:31,625
Remember Scarface,
motherfucker?

287
00:24:31,833 --> 00:24:35,875
'' Look at you now.
Look at you now, you fuck.''

288
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:40,000
So it must feel good
to be able to put to use...

289
00:24:40,208 --> 00:24:42,167
...those lessons
you learned in the military.

290
00:24:42,375 --> 00:24:45,000
Yeah, well, l really wasn't
in the military.

291
00:24:45,458 --> 00:24:46,833
You're not a salesman, Simon.

292
00:24:46,958 --> 00:24:50,042
And you're not a cop. And someone
taught you how to fight like that.

293
00:24:50,333 --> 00:24:54,000
No, no, no. All the fighting stuff,
l got that off home videos.

294
00:24:55,042 --> 00:24:56,750
Whatever.

295
00:24:56,917 --> 00:24:59,417
-Listen, could l ask you a question?
-Shoot.

296
00:24:59,667 --> 00:25:02,417
Those bangers that were here,
what gang are they with?

297
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,542
Hyde Park.
They're Chivo's boys.

298
00:25:05,667 --> 00:25:07,958
Chivo had something to do
with your son's murder?

299
00:25:08,167 --> 00:25:09,583
l'll let you know.

300
00:25:11,917 --> 00:25:15,417
-Hello.
-Hello, this is Simon.

301
00:25:16,292 --> 00:25:18,333
Simon? Yeah....

302
00:25:18,458 --> 00:25:22,667
Yeah, Max spoke very fondly
about you.

303
00:25:23,583 --> 00:25:25,042
l saw you at the funeral.

304
00:25:25,958 --> 00:25:29,375
l wanted to come over
and pay my condolences...

305
00:25:29,542 --> 00:25:32,375
...but l just wasn't quite
in the mood, sorry.

306
00:25:33,167 --> 00:25:34,667
l understand.

307
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:37,542
l wanted to see if the police
had been by to interview you...

308
00:25:37,667 --> 00:25:41,583
...and whether or not they returned
any of Max's property, or....

309
00:25:42,083 --> 00:25:44,833
They were more interested
in any files or paperwork...

310
00:25:45,042 --> 00:25:46,542
...that he might have
brought home.

311
00:25:47,042 --> 00:25:52,625
did Max have anything
on a computer, by any chance?

312
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,292
Yeah, but the police took it.

313
00:25:56,542 --> 00:25:59,667
Well, listen,
l just want you to know one thing.

314
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:01,458
l will find who did this to my son.

315
00:26:01,583 --> 00:26:05,458
And if you need anything,
you call me, you hear?

316
00:26:05,958 --> 00:26:07,958
All right, babe.

317
00:26:08,958 --> 00:26:11,292
-Shoot it.
-Defence.

318
00:26:11,458 --> 00:26:13,958
Come on, man,
don't let them score again.

319
00:26:15,458 --> 00:26:16,917
Man.

320
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,375
Pass the ball, man.

321
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:22,708
Make some shots, l could dish it
to you. You playing with no d on it.

322
00:26:23,042 --> 00:26:26,708
They done got three points, man.
lt's 9-7. You wanna win this or what?

323
00:26:26,833 --> 00:26:29,250
-You crazy?
-We need to talk.

324
00:26:33,958 --> 00:26:37,292
Look around you, fool.
You see all those eyes on us?

325
00:26:38,375 --> 00:26:41,000
Any of them see me get in that car,
l'm dead. You feel me?

326
00:26:41,167 --> 00:26:45,625
Well, look, l'll just pretend like
l'm a policeman. You know?

327
00:26:45,917 --> 00:26:47,667
You ain't no cop,
that's for sure, man.

328
00:26:47,833 --> 00:26:50,083
Heard what happened
to them boys.

329
00:26:50,292 --> 00:26:53,125
News in the 'hood travels fast,
don't it, now?

330
00:26:53,292 --> 00:26:55,000
Look, man, l need your help.

331
00:26:55,292 --> 00:26:57,833
-What's up, partner?
-lt's good, homes.

332
00:26:58,333 --> 00:26:59,375
What kind of help?

333
00:26:59,667 --> 00:27:01,875
l need you to help me find
who killed my son.

334
00:27:02,792 --> 00:27:06,375
Ain't no way nobody ever gonna find
his killer, man, that's for damn sure.

335
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,375
You have to tell me what you know.

336
00:27:12,792 --> 00:27:15,042
What you gonna do
if you find the shooter, huh?

337
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,208
l'm gonna kill him.

338
00:27:20,125 --> 00:27:22,792
l don't care who ordered the hit.

339
00:27:23,958 --> 00:27:26,667
l don't care
whose business is what.

340
00:27:26,917 --> 00:27:29,375
l just wanna know
who killed my son.

341
00:27:37,417 --> 00:27:39,292
lt's not looking good for me, man.

342
00:27:39,333 --> 00:27:40,583
Get in the car.

343
00:27:57,375 --> 00:27:59,042
All right, showtime.
What do you know?

344
00:28:01,417 --> 00:28:05,042
Man, look, man, there's this Mexican
called El Chivo, all right?

345
00:28:05,208 --> 00:28:06,875
-The goat?
-Yeah.

346
00:28:07,042 --> 00:28:09,583
He runs the Hyde Park Gang.

347
00:28:10,042 --> 00:28:11,708
Them motherfuckers there.

348
00:28:11,875 --> 00:28:14,542
You think this guy
might have pulled the trigger?

349
00:28:16,125 --> 00:28:17,792
Maybe.

350
00:28:17,958 --> 00:28:20,667
l mean, maybe he had
somebody pull a drive-by.

351
00:28:20,917 --> 00:28:26,250
Well, like l said, l don't really care
about who ordered it or anything.

352
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,667
l just want the shooter.

353
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:30,750
Well, if it came from Chivo,
he would know who did it.

354
00:28:31,083 --> 00:28:33,875
You have any idea
why he might want my son dead?

355
00:28:35,417 --> 00:28:40,292
Max, man.... Look, he hit
them bookie joints hard, man.

356
00:28:40,458 --> 00:28:43,125
Chivo, he runs most of them.
You know how it is, man.

357
00:28:43,417 --> 00:28:46,125
You start fucking with a man's money,
you could end up dead.

358
00:28:48,292 --> 00:28:50,125
Where can l find this guy?

359
00:28:50,958 --> 00:28:55,625
He got a club on Slauson
called Anodyne, all right?

360
00:28:55,708 --> 00:28:57,542
He's there most nights.

361
00:28:58,583 --> 00:29:00,667
All right, you did good, man.

362
00:29:00,792 --> 00:29:03,000
l'll see you soon, you hear?
Thank you.

363
00:29:03,292 --> 00:29:06,292
Yeah, man. Right.

364
00:29:08,167 --> 00:29:09,250
Hey, Gary.

365
00:29:10,292 --> 00:29:11,417
This yours?

366
00:29:14,667 --> 00:29:17,583
What the fuck is he doing?

367
00:29:17,958 --> 00:29:21,000
don't worry about it, dude.
Look like he talking to some cop.

368
00:29:21,333 --> 00:29:24,750
Talking to a cop?
Man, you better check this, man.

369
00:29:24,917 --> 00:29:27,167
dude, that's my little brother,
all right?

370
00:29:27,375 --> 00:29:28,833
l'll handle that shit.

371
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,292
All right.

372
00:29:30,458 --> 00:29:32,917
don't fucking worry about it,
all right?

373
00:29:42,417 --> 00:29:45,042
Hey, lsaiah, what up, man?

374
00:29:45,042 --> 00:29:47,542
-The fuck was that about?
-Nothing.

375
00:29:48,125 --> 00:29:49,833
don't fucking lie to me.
Who is he?

376
00:29:50,292 --> 00:29:53,000
-That cop's old man.
-You tell him anything?

377
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:55,292
Just where to find Chivo
and them.

378
00:29:56,833 --> 00:29:58,917
You believe this shit, yo?

379
00:29:58,958 --> 00:30:01,125
Man, does a chicken have lips?

380
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:02,708
-Shut up.
-Like l give a fuck.

381
00:30:02,833 --> 00:30:05,292
-Come on, man.
-All right, yo. Listen.

382
00:30:05,417 --> 00:30:07,375
You stay the fuck away from him,
feel me?

383
00:30:07,583 --> 00:30:09,875
-He came looking for me.
-l don't give a fuck.

384
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,333
lf l see you with him again,
l'm gonna whup your ass, all right?

385
00:30:14,333 --> 00:30:15,667
-All right?
-All right, man.

386
00:30:15,833 --> 00:30:18,792
-Yo, tell Moms l won't be home tonight.
-Where you gonna be?

387
00:30:18,958 --> 00:30:21,083
-Don't worry about it, just tell her.
-Fine.

388
00:30:21,333 --> 00:30:23,292
-l'm out, yo.
-All right.

389
00:30:53,292 --> 00:30:54,833
Excuse me, sir.
Could l talk to you?

390
00:30:55,042 --> 00:30:57,208
Why don't you get out of here?

391
00:30:57,375 --> 00:31:00,625
You know, l wanna see Chivo.

392
00:31:00,917 --> 00:31:03,625
You know, the problem is,
this is a private club...

393
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:05,333
...and your name's
not on the list.

394
00:31:05,458 --> 00:31:07,958
So why don't you
just get the fuck out of here?

395
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:11,000
You look like a smart guy.
l'll tell you what l'm gonna do.

396
00:31:11,083 --> 00:31:13,917
l'll give you 5 bucks
if you could let me in.

397
00:31:15,042 --> 00:31:16,125
How's that?

398
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:17,958
-l'll tell you what, tough guy.
-What?

399
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:20,917
lf you can make it back down,
you and me, we've got a date.

400
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
-All right.
-Why don't you go on in?

401
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,375
Hey, man, private club.

402
00:31:49,583 --> 00:31:51,708
-Who the fuck--?
-Hey, hey.

403
00:32:01,875 --> 00:32:05,167
l'm Simon Ballister, Max's father.

404
00:32:06,292 --> 00:32:08,250
Sorry to hear about your son.

405
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:12,583
l wanted to talk to you
for a minute, if l could.

406
00:32:13,708 --> 00:32:16,000
Girls, l have to say,
l've found something...

407
00:32:16,208 --> 00:32:18,000
...more important
than you right now.

408
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,042
l'll be back.

409
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:26,917
So you're the crazy vato that's been
beating the shit out of all my guys.

410
00:32:27,167 --> 00:32:29,667
Well, l've been trying
to get some answers, you know?

411
00:32:29,917 --> 00:32:32,917
Yeah. Kind of becoming a habit
with you, ain't it?

412
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:35,083
l hope not.

413
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,417
Some folks say you might know
something about who killed my son.

414
00:32:43,625 --> 00:32:45,000
Now, let me take a guess.

415
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:47,958
You heard that from some
myopic gangbangers, right?

416
00:32:48,125 --> 00:32:49,042
That's right.

417
00:32:50,167 --> 00:32:52,000
l thought so.

418
00:32:52,042 --> 00:32:55,042
Why would l wanna kill Max?
He was a good cop.

419
00:32:55,083 --> 00:32:58,833
We were a lot alike,
both pillars of the community.

420
00:32:59,083 --> 00:33:02,333
We both helped our people
our own way.

421
00:33:02,958 --> 00:33:07,708
Well, you know, seems like maybe
he took down a few of your joints.

422
00:33:07,792 --> 00:33:09,208
So what? This is the barrio.

423
00:33:09,417 --> 00:33:12,333
Takes down one of my joints today,
it's back up tomorrow.

424
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:16,542
And besides, we all know
what kind of heat a dead cop brings.

425
00:33:16,917 --> 00:33:20,625
No. You ever heard of a gang
called the East Side Gangsters?

426
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:24,250
Heard it came from them.

427
00:33:24,542 --> 00:33:28,000
lt sounds like maybe you're asking me
to take out your competition.

428
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,250
l am.

429
00:33:33,583 --> 00:33:37,250
East Side Gangsters been trying
to cut into my territory for years.

430
00:33:37,458 --> 00:33:39,833
Especially that Armand Tucker.

431
00:33:40,042 --> 00:33:42,583
Yeah, l want you
to take them down...

432
00:33:42,958 --> 00:33:46,167
...but that doesn't mean
what l'm telling you isn't true.

433
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,792
l liked your son.

434
00:33:49,917 --> 00:33:54,375
l swear on my dead mother's grave,
they did it.

435
00:34:02,208 --> 00:34:05,750
You know, l look at you...

436
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,792
...l see a man like me.

437
00:34:09,375 --> 00:34:13,333
A bad man with good intentions.

438
00:34:13,417 --> 00:34:14,833
l believe you.

439
00:34:16,542 --> 00:34:19,792
Mami, tequila.

440
00:34:25,625 --> 00:34:27,583
-Anything else?
-Later.

441
00:34:38,833 --> 00:34:41,917
Here's to my son, and finding
the motherfucker who killed him.

442
00:34:45,167 --> 00:34:47,000
Tough guy.

443
00:34:47,583 --> 00:34:48,792
See, the problem is--

444
00:34:48,917 --> 00:34:51,833
-Excuse me. l really need to talk--
-Get the fuck out of here.

445
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,375
doing that to my homeboy,
the problem is, l ain't him--

446
00:34:56,417 --> 00:34:57,958
You mean motherfucker.

447
00:34:58,083 --> 00:35:00,458
l don't like it when you pick on
the little people.

448
00:35:00,625 --> 00:35:02,167
-Oh, man.
-Come here.

449
00:35:02,375 --> 00:35:03,708
-Oh, man.
-Come on.

450
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,250
Oh, God, no.

451
00:35:05,458 --> 00:35:06,833
-Thank you.
-You busted my hand.

452
00:35:06,917 --> 00:35:08,417
Thanks so much.

453
00:35:08,667 --> 00:35:11,000
-Bottle of tequila, keep yourself warm.
-Thank you.

454
00:35:11,125 --> 00:35:13,125
-My name's J.d.
-Sandwich. Nice to meet you.

455
00:35:13,333 --> 00:35:14,833
-Thank you, man.
-All right.

456
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,875
-Y'all be good.
-l know it, man.

457
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
-Come back and see me sometime.
-l will.

458
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:25,000
Yeah, l think we got him.

459
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,917
l want a 24-hour tail on him
from now on.

460
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:34,417
Simon, l just wanted you to know,
for whatever it's worth...

461
00:35:34,667 --> 00:35:39,333
...that l really respect you for how
you've handled this whole situation.

462
00:35:39,833 --> 00:35:42,000
You and Max
must have been really close.

463
00:35:43,583 --> 00:35:47,958
You know, when time passes on,
you kind of get to thinking a little bit.

464
00:35:48,667 --> 00:35:54,000
Seems like
every day that goes by...

465
00:35:54,875 --> 00:35:58,167
...you kind of can't get used
to the fact...

466
00:35:58,333 --> 00:36:01,292
...that somebody
that close to you is gone.

467
00:36:01,458 --> 00:36:05,042
You always think,
'' Hey, man, l gotta call my son'' ...

468
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:06,958
...or, '' l'm going to see him soon.''

469
00:36:07,208 --> 00:36:09,083
And then you
kind of remember...

470
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:12,958
...the unthinkable
has actually happened.

471
00:36:12,958 --> 00:36:16,167
Aim. Fire.

472
00:36:32,625 --> 00:36:36,500
There's really
no greater sorrow...

473
00:36:36,708 --> 00:36:41,458
... than when a man's own child
passes before he does.

474
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,708
And l do have regrets,
because when he was a child...

475
00:36:47,833 --> 00:36:51,917
...l really didn't spend
much time with him.

476
00:37:11,542 --> 00:37:13,500
But when he got older...

477
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:16,458
...l really kind of feel like
l got to make it up.

478
00:37:17,458 --> 00:37:21,542
You could be away from somebody
for 1 0 years...

479
00:37:21,708 --> 00:37:25,667
...knock on the door, walk through
that door, and it's like you never left.

480
00:37:26,292 --> 00:37:28,292
That's close...

481
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:32,375
...and that's how he and l were,
you know?

482
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:34,708
That close.

483
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:45,583
That's him right there, yo.

484
00:37:45,792 --> 00:37:48,625
Why the fuck does Armand
want this nigga dead anyway?

485
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:51,833
doesn't matter.
Let's smoke this fool.

486
00:37:52,042 --> 00:37:54,042
We do this and we in.

487
00:37:54,208 --> 00:37:57,000
Bread, bitches and cocaine.

488
00:37:57,333 --> 00:38:00,333
-You need to stop that snorting shit.
-Man, nigga, fuck you.

489
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:03,333
-Let's smoke this fool.
-Don't fuck up my car, hell.

490
00:38:12,583 --> 00:38:14,042
Say good night, motherfucker.

491
00:38:18,958 --> 00:38:20,750
Goddamn,
l can't believe you missed.

492
00:38:20,917 --> 00:38:24,167
-Back this motherfucker up. Let's go.
-Goddamn, motherfucker. God, shit.

493
00:38:37,667 --> 00:38:39,500
-Motherfucker.
-We gotta get out of L.A.

494
00:38:39,667 --> 00:38:42,500
l'm going. lf you didn't have
a motherfucking slow-ass hearse--

495
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:45,083
You keep talking about my car,
you gonna catch a bus.

496
00:38:45,292 --> 00:38:46,458
Here. Look, we here.

497
00:38:53,583 --> 00:38:54,667
Come on.

498
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:57,792
Get the tyre, something. Shit.

499
00:39:00,333 --> 00:39:01,583
Fuck!

500
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,708
Look at your dumb ass
missing and shit.

501
00:39:06,917 --> 00:39:09,833
-Come on, come on.
-All right, l'm gonna get you closer.

502
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:18,625
-Shoot the tyres out.
-Drive my motherfucking car.

503
00:39:18,667 --> 00:39:20,792
Just shoot the motherfucking
tyres out this time.

504
00:39:21,083 --> 00:39:22,917
Watch me.

505
00:39:27,333 --> 00:39:29,667

l'm disappointed in both of y'all.

570
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,542
Especially you, lsaiah.

571
00:46:31,667 --> 00:46:34,000
You hold your bitch ass up
right there, partner.

572
00:46:34,042 --> 00:46:36,833
Take that motherfucking rag off
around your bitch-ass neck.

573
00:46:37,083 --> 00:46:39,708
You ain't repping shit.

574

00:46:44,250 --> 00:46:47,125
Look at the floor.

Boy, l put trust in you.

00:46:51,917 --> 00:46:55,333
l put trust in you,
but you wanna fuck up.

578
00:46:56,875 --> 00:47:00,333
You know l don't ask people
for many things, man.

579
00:47:01,583 --> 00:47:05,292
Most of what l accomplish,
l accomplish myself.

580
00:47:05,458 --> 00:47:07,958
Everything l accomplish,
l accomplish my damn self...

581
00:47:07,958 --> 00:47:10,458
...because l ain't gonna never
snitch on me, nigga.

582
00:47:10,625 --> 00:47:12,667
l asked you to do this
to prove yourself...

583
00:47:12,958 --> 00:47:14,333
...and you drop the ball, coz.

584
00:47:14,667 --> 00:47:17,000
-Yo, man, this Simon--
-Silence, nigga.

585

Look, l know
this motherfucker tough.

586
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:23,625
That's why l gave you this assignment.
lt's a chance to prove yourself.

587
00:47:23,792 --> 00:47:26,333
Now, if you prove yourself,
we got a thing called trust.

588
00:47:26,458 --> 00:47:28,833
Trust go a long way
in this organisation.

589
00:47:29,042 --> 00:47:30,500
You understand me?

590
00:47:31,333 --> 00:47:32,792
-You understand me?
-Yes, sir.

591
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:36,458
Good, because
if you don't do this correctly, partner...

592
00:47:36,542 --> 00:47:39,083
...we ain't friends.
Matter of fact, we enemies.

593
00:47:39,375 --> 00:47:41,000
You, your family, your mama...

594
00:47:41,250 --> 00:47:44,000
...that pregnant bitch
you got around the corner, nigga.

595
00:47:44,333 --> 00:47:46,083
Yeah. You wanna see
that child, nigga?

596
00:47:46,292 --> 00:47:49,000
Because l don't give a fuck
about the little motherfucker.

597
00:47:49,583 --> 00:47:52,000
Why don't you do yourself
a motherfucking favour...

598
00:47:52,042 --> 00:47:54,000
...and go kill that son of a bitch?

599
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,583
Keep your head up, coz.

600
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,292
And this time, make sure
he lay down and stay there.

601
00:48:04,333 --> 00:48:07,208
They don't make niggas

00:48:19,417 --> 00:48:22,667
He wanna run his little white ass
around here like he renegade.

607
00:48:22,958 --> 00:48:25,792
Matter of fact-- Hey, you bitches,
get your ass up out of here.

608
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,667

Good game, though.
Good game.

01:13:20,667 --> 01:13:22,250
Fuck, man. lsaiah.

He fine, he fine. He all right.

Who did my son?
You played me.

847
01:13:27,833 --> 01:13:30,708
You lied to me about Chivo,
you sent me down the wrong road.

848
01:13:30,958 --> 01:13:33,292
-What are you hiding?
-lt was that dirty cop, Shaw...

849
01:13:33,458 --> 01:13:36,250
...who killed Max, man.

850
01:13:38,292 --> 01:13:42,000
When l was--
When l was hanging with lsaiah...

01:13:42,083 --> 01:13:45,750
...l overheard a conversation
between Shaw and Armand.

852
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,667
They was talking about
how they gonna eliminate Max, man.

853
01:13:48,958 --> 01:13:50,417
Why?

854
01:13:50,667 --> 01:13:55,042
l told you, man.
Max, he was a nice guy.

855
01:13:57,250 --> 01:14:00,792
l tried to warn him, man.
l went there that night.

856
01:14:13,167 --> 01:14:15,042
l was just too late.

857
01:14:17,708 --> 01:14:18,958
Too fucking late.

858
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,750
Fuck, l saw it all happen.

859
01:14:39,375 --> 01:14:43,000
Shaw just shot him.
Fucking shot him.

860
01:14:43,458 --> 01:14:47,833
Wiped the gun down,
threw it over a fence.

861
01:14:47,958 --> 01:14:52,042
l hopped that fence, man.
l grabbed the gun, l fucking ran.

01:14:55,083 --> 01:14:59,000
l ran, man,
until l ain't hear fucking shit.

864
01:14:59,083 --> 01:15:01,583
No siren, nothing.

865
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:07,292
l sure enough wish you would have
told me that a long time ago.

866
01:15:09,875 --> 01:15:13,000
l did not come to this town
to get played.

867
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:16,167
l wanted to come here
and take care of one thing.

868
01:15:16,750 --> 01:15:18,792
l'm gonna go see Shaw.

869
01:15:19,708 --> 01:15:23,667
-l hope you're not lying.
-l'm sorry, man.

01:15:24,208 --> 01:15:26,500

Fucking family.

This is an H&K G36.
lt's a bad machine gun, man.

874
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,417
-This is revenge.
-Yeah, that's what it is, revenge.

875
01:15:54,708 --> 01:15:56,750
What the fuck you think it is?

876
01:15:57,208 --> 01:15:59,500
-Why?
-Because they killed my son.

877
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:03,750
-Simon, this is never going to end.
-l don't really give a fuck what they do.

878
01:16:03,917 --> 01:16:05,750
l just know what l'm gonna do.

879
01:16:07,125 --> 01:16:11,875
-You're just as bad as they are.
-No, l'm a lot fucking worse.

880
01:17:06,542 --> 01:17:09,625
-These guys for real?
-For sure.

881
01:17:11,292 --> 01:17:13,250
Say, man,
l don't trust this motherfucker.

882
01:17:13,417 --> 01:17:15,042
You gotta watch them.

883
01:17:15,042 --> 01:17:18,583
These motherfuckers get out of line,
we gonna take them out, all right?

884
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,292
Yeah, it's about that time, nigga.

885
01:17:26,708 --> 01:17:29,875
-What's up, coz?
-Armand.

886
01:17:35,417 --> 01:17:37,042
What's up with the white boys?

887
01:17:37,167 --> 01:17:40,250
Hey, man, what can l say?
Affirmative action, you know.

888
01:17:44,250 --> 01:17:47,042
l wouldn't touch that
till l see some money.

889
01:17:49,417 --> 01:17:51,250
Come on.

890
01:17:53,375 --> 01:17:54,583
Check that out, Shaw.

891
01:17:59,375 --> 01:18:00,667
Yeah, we're good.

892
01:18:17,708 --> 01:18:19,083
Just like l promised.

-Nigga, what's your problem?
-What's my problem?

01:18:31,458 --> 01:18:35,042
l'll tell you what my problem is.
That's fucking baking soda, bitch.

897
01:18:35,625 --> 01:18:37,042
lt is baking soda.

898
01:18:37,250 --> 01:18:40,500
l should have known better than to
deal with low-level West Coast hood.

899
01:18:40,958 --> 01:18:42,542
Fuck the West Coast, nigga.

900
01:18:42,667 --> 01:18:45,042
Get my money

901
01:18:53,333 --> 01:18:54,208

Somebody answer me.
What's going on?

903
01:19:09,917 --> 01:19:12,500
-That motherfucker Ballister.
-Fucking son of a bitch.

904
01:19:12,625 --> 01:19:14,375
Ballister? What does that mean?

905
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:18,000
Hey, man, why don't you do yourself
and me a favour, all right?

906
01:19:18,167 --> 01:19:19,542
Shut the fuck up.

907
01:19:21,917 --> 01:19:25,000
Now, l know my original plan
didn't go as planned...

908
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:28,792
-...but l got a contingency.
-Contingency plan?

909
01:19:28,917 --> 01:19:31,542
Bitch, what the fuck
is your contingency plan?

910
01:19:31,833 --> 01:19:34,000
Just let me look over
the paperwork, partner.

911
01:19:48,292 --> 01:19:51,833
That's the motherfucking
contingency plan, partner.

912
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:55,250
-You motherfuckers.
-Yeah, fuck you, bitch.

913
01:19:55,458 --> 01:19:57,083
Look at your whore ass now.

tampon, nigga, what?

915
01:20:00,500 --> 01:20:02,542
That's the problem with you
New York niggas.

916
01:20:02,667 --> 01:20:04,333
Running around,
all shiny and shit.

917
01:20:04,375 --> 01:20:08,583
You dressed for the funeral
you about to have, motherfucker.

918
01:20:08,792 --> 01:20:11,167
-You gonna kill me?
-Oh, l think it's obvious, partner.

919
01:20:11,458 --> 01:20:12,375
Look around.

920
01:20:18,958 --> 01:20:21,875
You already fucked up, Armand,
by double-crossing me.

921
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:25,667
-Don't make this shit any worse.
-Let's see, how could it get worse?

922
01:20:25,917 --> 01:20:29,208
Look like your boys is dead.
Yeah, you dead already.

You kill me, my homeboys
are gonna retaliate.

Believe me, motherfucker,

925
01:20:36,083 --> 01:20:37,708
How the fuck

926
01:20:37,917 --> 01:20:40,500
...gonna retaliate,
you stupid son of a bitch?

927
01:20:40,625 --> 01:20:44,250
A dead man can't walk.
You already dead, see?

928
01:20:44,375 --> 01:20:48,667
You got killed by the L.A.P.D.
in a motherfucking shootout.

929
01:20:48,875 --> 01:20:52,958
Process that, nigga. Can your neuron
fire that fast, motherfucker?

930
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:56,167
Yeah, that's what happened.
L.A.P.D. shot your bitch ass.

931
01:20:56,417 --> 01:20:59,417
Happens all the time.
Ain't that right, Shaw?

932
01:21:06,875 --> 01:21:08,833
Yeah, that's right.

933
01:21:26,458 --> 01:21:28,792
-l got the stairs. You take the front.
-Got it.

934
01:24:40,042 --> 01:24:41,750
Fuck.

01:24:48,250 --> 01:24:50,792
Come on out here, you big fuck.

937
01:24:51,042 --> 01:24:53,583
Let's go. You and me, brother.

938
01:24:55,458 --> 01:24:57,917

939
01:24:58,792 --> 01:25:00,625
Hey!

01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:04,083
Come on, you stupid fuck,

01:25:05,250 --> 01:25:07,958
Pussy. Come on, baby.

943
01:25:14,042 --> 01:25:16,542
You're gonna make me
come to you, huh?

944
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,667
Where are you, sensei?

945
01:25:31,625 --> 01:25:32,667
Obi-Wan.

946
01:26:07,958 --> 01:26:09,167
Fuck.

947
01:26:31,292 --> 01:26:32,792
Kill this motherfucker.

948
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,250
Kill him. Kill him.

949
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:37,708
Kill him.

950
01:26:40,583 --> 01:26:42,083
Kill him.

951
01:26:50,667 --> 01:26:52,583
l gotta hand it to you, partner.

952
01:26:54,583 --> 01:26:58,125
You're quite the father. Come back
and run through the neighbourhood.

953
01:26:58,333 --> 01:27:00,250
Killing up all kind of niggas
and Mexicans.

954
01:27:00,542 --> 01:27:02,000
Just a white boy on a rampage.

955
01:27:04,167 --> 01:27:06,917
But we still got this little dilemma,
now, do we not?

956
01:27:07,208 --> 01:27:10,000
l know you ain't dumb enough
to bring a fist to a gunfight.

957
01:27:11,042 --> 01:27:11,917
l am.

958
01:27:20,500 --> 01:27:22,708
You probably think
l'm gonna kill you.

959
01:27:23,333 --> 01:27:26,500
But you know what?
l came here for one thing.

960
01:27:26,667 --> 01:27:28,583
And l did what l came here to do.

961
01:27:30,292 --> 01:27:32,792
l got no beef with you.

962
01:27:45,500 --> 01:27:47,542
He's a cool motherfucker.

963
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,208
Now, that shit was gangster.
