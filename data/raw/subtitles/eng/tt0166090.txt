FLORA: Where are you hiding?

1178
01:03:04,648 --> 01:03:06,650
Papa?

1179
01:03:10,487 --> 01:03:12,855
Ah, you were right, Celeste.

1180
01:03:12,856 --> 01:03:15,658
I think we all needed this.

1181
01:03:15,659 --> 01:03:17,126
Why don't you go and do a bit

1182
01:03:17,127 --> 01:03:18,127
of fishing?

1183
01:03:18,128 --> 01:03:20,963
That always helps you relax.

1184
01:03:20,964 --> 01:03:23,198
I'll finish tidying up.

1185
01:03:23,199 --> 01:03:25,535

1203
01:04:28,331 --> 01:04:29,865
That tickles.

1204
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:30,866
Whoops.

1205
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:32,134

Ready?

1213
01:04:51,121 --> 01:04:52,421
On your marks,

1214
01:04:52,422 --> 01:04:54,523

Alexander!

1239
01:05:47,143 --> 01:05:49,144
Wanna ride in my boat?

1240
01:05:49,145 --> 01:05:50,913
Come back!

1241
01:05:50,914 --> 01:05:52,247
Nice little ducks,

1242
01:05:52,248 --> 01:05:55,918

1247
01:06:06,162 --> 01:06:08,330
Arthur, Zephir, watch the

1248
01:06:08,331 --> 01:06:11,600

1249
01:06:11,601 --> 01:06:12,601
Where are you going, little

1250
01:06:12,602 --> 01:06:13,635
ducks?

1251
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:15,170
(Fast quacking)

1252
01:06:15,171 --> 01:06:16,705
Hello, Papa.

1253
01:06:16,706 --> 01:06:19,474
I have a boat, too.

1254
01:06:19,475 --> 01:06:20,576
Wait, Alexander.

1255
01:06:20,577 --> 01:06:22,411
I've got a bite!

1256
01:06:22,412 --> 01:06:24,079
Alexander?

1257
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:27,916

It's yours, Babar.

1266
01:07:41,824 --> 01:07:44,293
Take it.

1267
01:07:44,294 --> 01:07:47,063
Thank you, little ducks.

01:07:56,205 --> 01:07:58,307
(Grumbling)

1269
01:07:58,308 --> 01:08:02,144

Madame.

1273
01:08:06,883 --> 01:08:08,150
Look out!

1274
01:08:08,151 --> 01:08:09,184
It's too dangerous.

1275
01:08:09,185 --> 01:08:10,185

No, you can't stay here.

1286
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:33,508
I won't let you hurt my friends!

1287
01:08:33,509 --> 01:08:35,310
I command you to leave my city
