<i>In the old days, we confiscated
cigarettes and wank mags.</i>

8
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:11,803
<i>Now it's knives and
crack cocaine.</i>

9
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:16,641
<i>And they call it progress.</i>

Mrs. Hart, art department.

Poison granny.

15
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,927
Piss off, you prick.

16
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:53,678
Before we begin, for those of you
who haven't delivered your reports,

17
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:57,978
please lob them in my general direction.
Thank you, Bill. Thank you, Mary.

00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:01,099
- Thank you, John. Thank you, Elaine.
- (DOOR OPENS)

19
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:06,271
Ah. Has everyone met our
new art teacher, Sheba Hart?

20
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:10,199
I've asked Sheba to sit in
on this meeting. As you all know,

21
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:15,200
I regard the arts as absolutely essential
to our policy of reform through nurture.

22
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:17,872
Thank you, Chris.
Very good. Very good.

23
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:21,494
Thank you, Sue. I say,
that's a big one, isn't it?

24
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:24,705
I'll be up till the crack of dawn!

25
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:28,133
Anyone else not handed in
their homework? Right, and...

26
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,093
Thank you.

27
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:33,180
Lovely. Thank you.

28
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:35,465
Barbara?

29
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:47,687
This is your report?
On the history department?

30
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:52,445
On its entire workings and your general
thoughts for its future development?

31
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,824
You'll find it's quite thorough,
Headmaster.

32
00:03:57,696 --> 00:04:02,247
"The history department functions as one
would expect for a school of this intake.

above the level of catastrophe."

35
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:15,134
"Recommendation,
no change necessary."

36
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,844
It took me most of the
summer to write it.

00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:47,454
<i>But clearly she's not.</i>

45
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:50,541
<i>A fey person, I suspect.</i>

46
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:52,501
<i>Fey.</i>

(BOY) Come on, come on, pass it.
Yes, I'm over here!

48
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:57,422
Yeah!

49
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:05,517
- (BARBARA) Put your shirt on.
- I got the winner.

50
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:08,396
Glory be. Shirt!

51
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:15,358
<i>She has certainly rippled the
waters of our stagnant pond.</i>

52
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,442
<i>They flock to her.</i>

53
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:23,283
<i>Even limp little Brian had a go.
Oh, the horror.</i>

54
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:25,914
- Hiya.
- Oh, hello.

55
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,745
- That's a lovely blouse.
- What? Oh!

56
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:32,173
<i>And Fatty Hodge has
pounced on her.</i>

57
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:34,798
<i>A dubious double act,</i>

58
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:38,047
<i>the blonde and the
pig in knickers.</i>

59
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:41,474
I just went past the art studio.
It's like bloody <i>Lord of the Flies.</i>

60
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:42,717
Have they gone for her?

61
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:45,554
Torn her posters down.
There's a paint fight.

62
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:49,938
They're chanting, "Get your tits out
for the lads." Girls, too. It's carnage.

63
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,226
(MAN) How was madam?

64
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:54,279
Lost it. "Stop it,
you little fucking bastards!"

65
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:58,359
- You should have stepped in.
- He didn't want to patronise the lady.

66
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:01,320
This time next year
she'll be headmistress.

67
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:05,374
- Oh, Christ, will you shut up?
- Sorry. Sorry.

68
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:08,372
Char, anyone?
Babs?

69
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:12,665
- Milk, no sugar.
- Sweet enough?

70
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:16,468
- Evidently.
- Didn't her father invent inflation?

71
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:19,300
- You what?
- Wasn't her dad that academic?

72
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:24,347
Donald whatsit. Economics bloke.
Invented the word "inflation".

73
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:26,929
Oh, yeah.
I know who you mean.

74
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:30,399
I think you'll find that Mrs.
Hart's father was Ronald Taylor.

75
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:32,942
He didn't invent inflation.

76
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:36,613
He devised a theory about
the relationship between inflation

77
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:38,694
and consumer expectation.

78
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:47,749
(SHEBA) Davis, get off him!
Stop it!

79
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:51,169
- (BOY) No, you're an arsehole.
- (SHEBA) Stop it!

80
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:56,848
(CHILDREN) Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight! Fight!

81
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:59,320
Stop it! Stop it immediately!

82
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:03,757
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

83
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,185
(SHEBA) You're going to hurt
one another! Now, stop it!

84
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:08,470
Davis, get off him!

85
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:11,022
Enough!

86
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:13,934
Outside! Now!

87
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:27,702
- Fuck off!
- (BARBARA) Absolute silence. Absolute!

88
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:37,925
- Why were they fighting, Mrs. Hart?
- Their motive was unclear.

89
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:41,594
Davis, I know. You're a little thug.
Who might you be?

90
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:43,429
- Steven Connolly, Miss.
- What?

91
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:45,386
- Steven Connolly, Miss.
- Year?

92
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:48,472
- Year 10, Miss.
- You're the naked footballer.

93
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:53,232
Why were you fighting?
It's a perfectly simple question.

94
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:55,854
- Dunno, Miss.
- You don't know.

95
00:07:56,101 --> 00:08:00,072
One minute you're inert, the next
you're trying to castrate a pupil.

96
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,031
Nothing occurred
between these two states?

97
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:03,199
No.

98
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:06,494
Don't play the hero with me,
Connolly. Yes?

99
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:09,573
Brain, mouth, speak.

100
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:15,246
He was saying stuff about Miss.
It was bang out of order.

101
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:19,295
- What did you say?
- I never said nothing, Miss.

102
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:23,466
"I didn't say anything."
What did he say? Come on!

103
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:26,927
He said she's a tart. He said he
gave her one up the arse.

104
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,138
Did you, indeed?

105
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:31,762
Odious boy. Apologise at once.

106
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:35,482
- Sorry, Miss.
- (BARBARA) Deputy head in the morning.

107
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,767
Get back inside, both of you.

108
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:47,201
Little towers of testosterone.
You'll soon get used to them.

109
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:50,451
Thank you so much.

110
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:54,535
I'd better... Oh, I'm sorry. We
haven't met properly. I'm Sheba Hart.

111
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:56,711
Barbara Covett.

112
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:04,670
<i>Her voice is pure,
as if her mouth were empty and clean.</i>

113
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:07,597
<i>As if she'd never had a filling.</i>

114
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:10,926
<i>The complexion of a white peach.</i>

115
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:13,728
<i>One can almost see her veins.</i>

116
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:17,645
<i>Her trendy politics
are similarly transparent.</i>

117
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:21,236
We serve them best if we teach
them to read, write and add.

118
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:23,814
They don't need to know
about basket weavers.

119
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:26,696
- Barbara's keen on the basics.
- When you started,

120
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:29,369
didn't you want to give them
a real education

121
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:33,790
to help them overcome
the poverty of their backgrounds?

122
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:38,746
Oh, yes, of course. But one soon
learns that teaching is crowd control.

123
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:41,377
Come here.
You know you're not supposed...

124
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:46,508
We're a branch of the social services.
Put that back, you.

125
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:51,599
Console yourself with the gems.

126
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:55,099
That's when it's satisfying.
You can make a real difference.

127
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:58,682
The rest is just
cattle-prod and pray.

128
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:03,194
<i>I can see why others
are beguiled by her.</i>

129
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,271
Oh, hello.

130
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:09,155
<i>I wonder if she possesses
the requisite heft?</i>

131
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:11,657
- Do you fancy a coffee?
- Yeah.

132
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:13,784
- (SUE) Sheba!
- (PHONE BEEPS)

133
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:14,464
Sorry.

134
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:16,892
That's the year 11s.
They're a nightmare.

135
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,874
Do you want to join us?
We're going for a quick coffee.

136
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:25,417
- I've got a bit of an announcement.
- You're leaving St George's?

137
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,968
No.

138
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:29,880
Oh, you're pregnant.

139
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:34,805
That's fantastic.

140
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:38,305
Oh, congratulations.
When are you due?

141
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:41,437
- June 7.
- A summer baby. How lovely.

142
00:10:41,516 --> 00:10:44,611
I can't believe nobody's noticed.
I'm 14 weeks.

143
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:46,563
Didn't you see how
chunky I'm getting?

144
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,990
Didn't like to say.
Where are you having it?

145
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:52,820
(SUE) Homerton.
It's really nice there.

146
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:55,030
Lovely, friendly nurses.

147
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:58,037
I'm going to find out at the next scan.
20 weeks.

148
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:04,961
- Do you want to come to lunch on Sunday?
- Where?

149
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:08,384
To mine. To our house.

150
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:12,839
- Won't you be with the family?
- Oh, yes, but you're very welcome.

151
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:17,268
It's no big deal.
I'll just do a lasagne or something.

152
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:19,471
I adore lasagne.

153
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:26,654
<i>Bliss. A merry flag on the Arctic
wilderness of my calendar.</i>

154
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:31,074
<i>One must make an effort
when one receives an invitation.</i>

155
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:36,659
<i>The art of it is seeming not to.</i>

156
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:45,547
<i>Lasagne tends to disagree with my bowels.</i>

157
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:48,216
<i>I'll ask for a small portion.</i>

158
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:17,240
Oh, I think I've got
the wrong house.

159
00:12:17,266 --> 00:12:20,349
No, you're bang on. I'm Richard.
Come in.

160
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:22,750
I'm sorry. I thought...

161
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:25,123
That I'd be 20 years younger
and handsome.

162
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:27,422
- Bash!
- (SHEBA) The kitchen's on fire!

163
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:30,258
Sorry if you were there long.
The bell's knackered.

164
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,094
- Hi, Barbara.
- Hello.

165
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:38,345
Oh, what a splendid room.

166
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:41,769

(BARBARA) A dry sherry, please.

168
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:48,018
I think we might have some
apricot brandy knocking around.

169
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,270
- A dry white wine?
- Done.

170

- Excuse me?

- You're all poshed up.
- Oh.

175
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:18,548
I have an appointment.

176
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:21,267
Later, in town.

177
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:30,648
- Have you always lived here?
- Mum inherited it. It's her little joke.

178
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:34,402
I only married her for the property.
Morning.

179
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:37,483
- Did Pete go?
- Mm.

180
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:41,322
- He was welcome to stay.
- He's not really into lunch.

181
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:43,785
Cheers.

182
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:48,085
Mm.
Are you interested in wine?

183
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:52,257

You?

186
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,349

00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:19,659
<i>And then there's the daughter,

191
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:23,113
<i>and finally a somewhat tiresome

192
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:26,871
Ah, lovely. Thank you.

- (BARBARA) Oh.

194
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:35,342
- Is that when you're grown up?
- No. He's been cast in his school play.

It was years ago.

210

00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,393

It was supposed to
be my studio, but

214

(SHEBA) Mm.

218
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:31,366

I'll treasure them.

224
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:51,561

a family and teaching as well.

I shouldn't have kidded
myself I could teach.

228
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:10,947
It's just that I've spent the
last ten years looking after Ben

229
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,874
and I was so desperate
to get out and do something,

230
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:19,127

local school and I'm free to work and...

- You're gonna be a terrific teacher.
- Thanks.

232
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:28,966
But I'm bloody hopeless,
and everyone knows it.

233
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:31,138
Children are feral.

Don't let them sense
your anxiety.

235
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:39,851
- How do you cope?
- Oh, I'm just a battle-axe.

236
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,979
I'm not popular,
but they respect me.

237
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:48,277
Well, you're popular with me. It's

<i>a novice confessing to
the mother superior.</i>

00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:30,076
You know, marriage and kids,
I mean, it's wonderful,

247
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:33,405
but it doesn't give you meaning.

248
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:37,284
It gives you an imperative
but it doesn't help you...

249
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:42,213
My father always used to say,
you know, on the tube, "Mind the gap."

250
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:51,090
I don't know. It's just the distance
between life as you dream it

251
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:53,266
and

252
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:56,936

Then a few days later he
came to see me.

Would you have a
look at me drawings?

I said that I would teach him after
school, but only if he felt like it.

- It's our job, isn't it?
- Within specified hours and curriculum.

00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:56,795
<i>(BARBARA) But surely you must have
suspected his motives?</i>

319

I sensed he had a little crush
on me, but so what?

320
00:25:01,792 --> 00:25:03,886
It was innocent.

321
00:25:03,961 --> 00:25:07,215
That's so much better.
You've absolutely got that knuckle.

- Don't be silly. Off you go.

324

- What are you having for tea, Miss?
- Probably buy something on the way home.

00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:23,572
- Are you a good cook?
- Not really.

00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:31,989
Go home, Steven.

00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:45,716
- That's when you should have stopped it.
- I did.

329
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:47,967
I told him I wouldn't
teach him any more.

330
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:51,176

00:26:19,787 --> 00:26:23,041
I'm going home to my family.
As should you.

336
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:25,171
Miss!

337
00:26:28,337 --> 00:26:32,558
My dad's got the sack.
He's been taking it out on me.

338
00:26:32,633 --> 00:26:36,638
<i>(SHEBA) His father hit him. He didn't
tell his mum because she was ill.</i>

339
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,770
<i>- Does your mother know?
- Kidney disease.</i>

340
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:44,774
- It's taking months for an operation.
- He was so vulnerable.

341
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:47,652
If he does it again, you tell me.

342
00:26:47,898 --> 00:26:50,071
Thanks, Miss.

343
00:26:51,068 --> 00:26:53,116
You're beautiful, Miss.

344
00:26:53,195 --> 00:26:54,947
You don't know how
beautiful you are.

345
00:27:02,204 --> 00:27:06,254
<i>(SHEBA) I hadn't been pursued
like this for years.</i>

346
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:11,214
<i>I knew it was wrong and immoral
and completely ridiculous,</i>

347
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:14,015
but I don't know.

348
00:27:14,091 --> 00:27:16,640
I just allowed it to happen.

349
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:18,766
The boy is 15!

350
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:25,277
- But he's quite mature for his age.
- "But" is not a helpful word here.

351
00:27:26,854 --> 00:27:29,357
This is going to sound sick

352
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:37,202
but something in me felt entitled. You
know, I've been good all my adult life.

353
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:41,787
I've been a decent wife,
dutiful mother, coping with Ben.

354
00:27:42,536 --> 00:27:46,666
<i>This voice inside me kept saying,
"Why shouldn't you be bad?</i>

355
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:50,969
<i>"You know, why shouldn't you transgress?
You've earned the right."</i>

356
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:52,546
I said get out, Denzel.

357
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:57,055
The rest of you get on
with your work, please.

358
00:27:57,134 --> 00:27:59,432
Hurry up.

359
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:13,108
(BEN LAUGHS)

360
00:28:26,622 --> 00:28:29,876
Sue phoned.
OK if I meet her for a drink?

361
00:28:30,751 --> 00:28:33,675
Sure.
I'll put bug-a-lugs to bed.

362
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:50,321
Evening, Miss.

363
00:29:21,343 --> 00:29:23,641
Make yourself comfortable.

364
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:27,816
It's incredibly important
we keep this secret.

365
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:33,981
- Does anyone know you're here?
- No.

366
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:40,487
Miss.

367
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:43,540
I'm no genius,
but I ain't a dickhead.

368
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:46,206
I won't tell no one.

369
00:29:46,535 --> 00:29:48,788
You can trust me.

370
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:54,801
We'd both get into
terrible trouble.

371
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:22,492
It was easy,
like having another drink

372
00:30:22,571 --> 00:30:25,450
when you know you shouldn't.

373
00:30:28,577 --> 00:30:30,830
Can I smoke, Miss?

374
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:35,425
You can do what you want,
but enough of this "Miss".

375
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:47,767
Were you a model once?

376
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:52,477
Well, you should have been.
You're well fit.

377
00:30:52,893 --> 00:30:55,021
Gosh, but don't I know it.

378
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:57,526
You're into The Streets?

379
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:00,359
Well, my daughter is.

380
00:31:01,485 --> 00:31:04,284
Is she the same age as me?

381
00:31:04,488 --> 00:31:06,661
None of your beeswax.

382
00:31:11,453 --> 00:31:14,798
Well, anyway,
the point is you're fit.

383
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:19,545
Well, so are you.

384
00:31:19,795 --> 00:31:25,177
You reckon? My sister thinks
I look like a bollock with measles.

385
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:29,479
You've done my brain in.

386
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:02,638
- You wanna do it again?
- (LAUGHS)

387
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:06,015
What?

388
00:32:08,218 --> 00:32:10,186
Yes.

389
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:13,057
I wanna do it again.

390
00:32:16,685 --> 00:32:19,029
I wanna do it again.

391
00:32:20,689 --> 00:32:22,942
The day we met,

392
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,322
it had already begun?

393
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:28,909
Yes.

394
00:32:28,989 --> 00:32:31,492
Deputy head in the morning.

395
00:32:31,575 --> 00:32:35,751
Noble sentiment, Connolly.
Next time, words, not fists.

396
00:32:35,829 --> 00:32:37,957
Get inside, both of you.

397
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:44,513
- And you had further relations that day?
- We went to the art room.

398
00:32:44,588 --> 00:32:48,218
Well, I'm glad I was such an aphrodisiac.
I was trying to help you.

399
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:51,349
You did. I'm incredibly grateful.

400
00:32:51,428 --> 00:32:54,227
You've been such a good friend.

401
00:32:55,724 --> 00:32:58,193
Not reciprocated, it seems.

402
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:05,067
I desperately wanted
to confess to you.

403
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:07,910
But how could I?

404
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:10,280
Barbara?

405
00:33:10,572 --> 00:33:14,076
It would have put you
in an impossible situation.

406
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:18,706
I so wish I had.

407
00:33:18,914 --> 00:33:21,713
You would have made me see sense.

408
00:33:22,042 --> 00:33:25,592
<i>(BARBARA) And then I realised
my fury had blinded me.</i>

409
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:29,925
<i>There was a magnificent
opportunity here.</i>

410
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:33,353
<i>Can we go inside?
I'm absolutely freezing.</i>

411
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:41,028
<i>With stealth, I might secure
the prize long term,</i>

412
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:44,231
<i>forever in my debt.</i>

413
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:47,943
<i>I could gain everything</i>

414
00:33:48,318 --> 00:33:50,412
<i>by doing nothing.</i>

415
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:54,958
Look...

416
00:33:56,535 --> 00:34:01,416
I know you have to tell them.
You know, the head, the school.

417
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:05,044
All I ask is that you wait
till the New Year.

418
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:10,424
I'm begging you. Please let me have
this Christmas with my family.

419
00:34:10,632 --> 00:34:13,932
Oh, you poor thing.

420
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:17,143
You've got yourself into a state?

421
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:20,566
I'm not going to report you.

422
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:25,484
I want to help you,
to support you through this.

423
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:33,079
You're not going to tell?

424
00:34:35,365 --> 00:34:37,834
- You won't tell anyone?
- Who would it benefit?

425
00:34:37,993 --> 00:34:41,418
Not you or the boy,
and certainly not the school.

426
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:44,291
No, this is a private matter,

427
00:34:45,125 --> 00:34:48,049
and we must keep it so.

428
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:50,930
Yes.

429
00:34:56,386 --> 00:34:58,514
- Maybe I should resign.
- Oh, no.

430
00:34:58,597 --> 00:35:00,691
No, that might alert suspicion.

431
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:06,067
No, you must stay at the school,
but the affair must end.

432
00:35:06,313 --> 00:35:08,657
Your solemn promise.

433
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:13,328
I can't help you if
you don't promise.

434
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:16,448
I promise.

435
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:22,337
So you'll tell him straight
after Christmas?

436
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:25,086
- It's all for the best.
- I know.

437
00:35:25,165 --> 00:35:29,261
Thank you so much.
You've been so brilliant.

438
00:35:29,336 --> 00:35:32,089
And you'll tell me
when it's done?

439
00:35:36,593 --> 00:35:39,142
Oh! You never said.

440
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:42,182
- (BARBARA) Standard issue for spinsters.
- (LAUGHS)

441
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:45,477
She's been off her food.
I'm worried about her.

442
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:49,235
There's a terrific vet up the road.
He was great with Ben's rabbit.

443
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:51,856
Got many people coming tomorrow?

444
00:35:51,882 --> 00:35:55,266
My lot, Richard's lot,
including first wife.

445
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:57,831
Oh. And your mother?

446
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:00,162
Oh, yes.

447
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:02,994
- Well, happy Christmas.
- Yeah. You, too.

448
00:36:03,078 --> 00:36:05,627
Thank you so much.

449
00:36:05,789 --> 00:36:07,416
Courage, mon brave.

450
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:12,053
<i>And bon voyage to
her little leprechaun.</i>

451
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:18,518
<i>Sheba and I share
a deep understanding now.</i>

452
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:22,932
<i>No one can violate</i>

<i>our magnificent complicity.</i>

454
00:36:25,767 --> 00:36:28,691
No! Wait till tomorrow!
Stop.

455
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,608
You've been gone ages.

456
00:36:32,816 --> 00:36:34,113
Oh.

457
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:37,161
Barbara was a little...
Some school thing.

458
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:40,289
- How's his nibs?
- Oh, still awake.

459
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:44,119
He's madly excited.
I said he could stay up for you.

460
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:45,749
And Polly?

461
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:48,631
- Depressed.
- Oh.

462
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:50,588
Pete phoned.

463
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:52,718
They had a row

464
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:55,388
and he's not coming tomorrow.

465
00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:58,267
D'you think he's bad news?

466
00:36:58,293 --> 00:37:01,628
Well, these older men
can be very dodgy.

467
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:18,160
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

468
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:21,326
Did Daddy tell you?

469
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:28,255
He's gonna bin me, I know it.

470
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:30,423
You're very lovely, darling.

471
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:33,593
He's clever enough
to appreciate it.

472
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:36,137
I'm fat as fuck, Mum.

473
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:40,725
He'll be back.

474
00:37:41,009 --> 00:37:43,011
I can't live without him.

475
00:37:43,303 --> 00:37:45,397
Oh...

476
00:37:47,557 --> 00:37:51,778
<i>Her fetish for the boy was
simply her snobbery manifested.</i>

477
00:37:51,853 --> 00:37:54,197
<i>He's working class
and he likes art,</i>

478
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:57,446
<i>as if he were a monkey who just
strolled out of a rainforest</i>

479
00:37:57,525 --> 00:38:00,995
<i>and asked for a gin and tonic.</i>

480
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:09,295
Have you heard from
that friend of yours, Barbara?

481
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:12,670
Bar? Wakey-wakey.

482
00:38:12,749 --> 00:38:16,595
Lorraine was asking if you'd heard
from that nice friend of yours.

483
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:18,763
- Who?
- Jennifer Dodd.

484
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,592
Oh.

485
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:24,427
She left the school.

486
00:38:24,511 --> 00:38:27,139
She's teaching in a
primary at Stoke.

487
00:38:27,889 --> 00:38:32,486
There's a chap, apparently.
I heard they're engaged.

488
00:38:36,189 --> 00:38:38,317
But it's true, it would be insane,
wouldn't it?

489
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:41,403
It's the most ridiculous
time for him to sell.

490
00:38:41,486 --> 00:38:43,989
Well, that's what I said.

491
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:46,207
I know.
He should give me a ring.

492
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:49,081
It's absolute madness
for him. I'm happy to...

493

There's no gravy. Sorry.

(WOMAN) God knows.
But this is what she's like.

499
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:34,581
Ever since Ronald died,
she's drifted inexorably.

500
00:39:34,664 --> 00:39:39,511
You see, her father was
an exceptional man. Exceptional.

501
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:42,047
Bathsheba's a loner,
I'm afraid.

502
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:45,851
She's beautiful, thank God,
and it's got her through,

503
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:49,930
but it's not quite the same
as possessing substance.

Happy Christmas.

00:55:12,351 --> 00:55:15,981
Jennifer.
This was our haunt.

677
00:55:19,608 --> 00:55:23,488
We were quite chummy for
a while, but poor thing,

678
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:27,825
- she suffered from a terrible depression.
- Oh.

679
00:55:27,908 --> 00:55:31,788
I tried to help,
but she rather unravelled.

680
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:34,623
She became alarmingly deluded.

681
00:55:34,706 --> 00:55:37,300
Did she go to hospital?

682
00:55:37,376 --> 00:55:38,923
No.

683
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:41,096
No, she got a job in Stoke.

684
00:55:42,256 --> 00:55:44,350
- When was this?
- Last summer.

685
00:55:44,424 --> 00:55:49,851
- But I feel I should have done more.
- I'm sure she knows you did your best.

686
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:52,024
Such a sensitive person.

687
00:55:52,683 --> 00:55:55,061
One conceals it, of course.

688
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:06,535
People languish for years with partners
who are clearly from another planet.

689
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:11,460
We want so much to believe
that we've found our other.

690
00:56:12,661 --> 00:56:18,634
It takes courage to recognise the real
as opposed to the convenient.

691
00:56:20,544 --> 00:56:25,050
When I was young I had
such a vision of myself.

692
00:56:25,132 --> 00:56:31,139
I dreamed I'd be someone to be
reckoned with, you know, in the world.

693
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:33,644
But one learns one's scale.

694
00:56:38,437 --> 00:56:41,782
I've such a dread of
ending my days alone.

695
00:56:41,857 --> 00:56:44,451
Yes. I... We all do.

696
00:56:44,526 --> 00:56:49,373
But recently I've allowed myself
to think that I may not be.

697
00:56:53,994 --> 00:56:56,292
Am I wrong?

698
00:56:59,291 --> 00:57:01,714
No.

699
00:57:14,973 --> 00:57:17,317
- (VET) Do you want to stay?
- (SOBS)

700
00:57:17,392 --> 00:57:22,614
Sometimes people find it comforting
to see them at peace.

701
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:27,536
Would you like to come back
in 20 minutes to say goodbye?

702
00:57:35,786 --> 00:57:39,461
- (SHEBA) Have you got your seat belt on?
- (RICHARD) Oh, no. What the fuck?

703
00:57:39,539 --> 00:57:42,918
- (POLLY) Oh, God, not her!
- Shut up. I won't be a minute.

704
00:57:43,001 --> 00:57:48,553
- (POLLY) Mum, don't get out of the car!
- Is it Portia? Oh, no.

705
00:57:49,716 --> 00:57:52,686
I've got to go back
to the vet's after it's done.

706
00:57:52,761 --> 00:57:55,184
Will you come with me?
I can't on my own.

707
00:57:55,389 --> 00:57:59,895
Of course I would. It's just that
Ben's doing his play at his school...

708
00:57:59,977 --> 00:58:02,821
- Play?
- We're all going. We're late, actually.

709
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:06,196
- Someone has died!
- I... I know.

710
00:58:07,067 --> 00:58:10,742
- And it's terribly sad.
- You owe me this!

711
00:58:10,821 --> 00:58:13,870
Ben, can't you make her vanish?
Use your wand.

712
00:58:13,949 --> 00:58:17,374
He's doing a show for
the first time in his life.

713
00:58:17,452 --> 00:58:20,080
- That's your choice, is it?
- (CAR HORN)

714
00:58:21,081 --> 00:58:22,799
Why don't you come?

715
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:25,339
I thought you understood
what friendship means.

716
00:58:26,086 --> 00:58:28,464
He's my child. He's my son.

717
00:58:29,423 --> 00:58:32,677
- He's just a little boy.
- Don't play the good mother with me.

718
00:58:32,926 --> 00:58:36,180
Could you tell me what's going on?
Is this some kind of coven?

719
00:58:36,263 --> 00:58:37,685
I can explain perfectly.

720
00:58:37,764 --> 00:58:39,983
Barbara's had some bad
news about her cat.

721
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:43,695
My condolences. Poor pussy.
Now, can I have my wife back, please?

722
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:46,193
- I don't like your tone.
- Why is she here?

723
00:58:46,273 --> 00:58:49,243
What kind of fucking spell
has she cast on you?

724
00:58:49,317 --> 00:58:53,823
- Ben is getting stressed. He's gonna blow!
- Oh, for God's sake. Get in the car!

725
00:58:53,905 --> 00:58:56,954
Give me a minute, will you?
I can handle this.

726
00:58:57,034 --> 00:58:59,378
I'm to be handled, am I?
Like toxic waste?

727
00:58:59,453 --> 00:59:03,879
You see me on sufferance.
I'm an imposition to be tolerated.

728
00:59:03,957 --> 00:59:08,428
No, of course not. I love our time
together. I'm your good, good friend.

729
00:59:08,503 --> 00:59:10,096
- Then stay with me.
- (HORN)

730
00:59:10,172 --> 00:59:11,248
I would if I could.

731
00:59:11,274 --> 00:59:15,124
I'm desperately sorry about Portia,
but you can see, I have to go.

732
00:59:15,177 --> 00:59:19,057
Think very carefully, madam.
Be aware of the consequences.

733
00:59:19,139 --> 00:59:21,393
Don't make this mean
any more than it is.

734
00:59:21,419 --> 00:59:22,384
Stay with me.

735
00:59:22,434 --> 00:59:23,606
(HORN)

736
00:59:24,019 --> 00:59:26,442
- I don't know what I'll do.
- (POLLY) Let's go!

737
00:59:26,521 --> 00:59:30,071
- Look, I'll call you, I promise.
- (POLLY) Come on!

740
00:59:40,368 --> 00:59:42,496
<i>Meaning what, exactly?</i>

741
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:46,254
<i>That I am loyal in my friendships?</i>

742
00:59:46,333 --> 00:59:49,678
<i>That I will go to the ends of
the earth for someone I admire?</i>

743
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:52,173
- Shazam!

745
01:00:17,197 --> 01:00:19,916
Not disturbing you, am I?

746
01:00:21,993 --> 01:00:24,371
It's just...

747
01:00:24,871 --> 01:00:26,999
I need to talk to you
about Mrs. Hart.

748
01:00:29,042 --> 01:00:31,795
- Sheba.
- Ah.

749
01:00:32,504 --> 01:00:34,552
It's a bit delicate.

750
01:00:34,923 --> 01:00:36,049
Can I come in?

751
01:00:49,604 --> 01:00:52,073
- Tea?
- Oh, lovely, thanks.

752
01:00:56,444 --> 01:00:59,072
You haven't got a biscuit?

753
01:01:05,328 --> 01:01:07,422
Cheers.

754
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:13,678
- Would you like me to take your hat?
- Ah. Been up the Lane.

755
01:01:13,753 --> 01:01:16,131
White Hart Lane,
home of the mighty Spurs.

756
01:01:16,214 --> 01:01:19,593
- Were you victorious?
- Three-nil. Jermain Defoe. Get in there!

757
01:01:22,596 --> 01:01:26,271
My father was a supporter
of Charlton Athletic.

758
01:01:27,392 --> 01:01:29,895
Never seemed to give
him any pleasure.

759
01:01:30,270 --> 01:01:31,772
Where's the moggy?

760
01:01:32,647 --> 01:01:34,069
She's dead.

761
01:01:35,567 --> 01:01:37,615
Oh, dear.

762
01:01:38,278 --> 01:01:41,532
Oh, my condolences. Aw.

763
01:01:44,367 --> 01:01:46,620
Oh, is this not a good time?

764
01:01:47,037 --> 01:01:49,165
It's a very good time.

765
01:02:01,468 --> 01:02:03,846
- Mrs. Hart.
- Yeah.

766
01:02:04,763 --> 01:02:06,765
It's just...

767
01:02:06,973 --> 01:02:10,102
Anything you tell me
will be in strictest confidence.

768
01:02:12,103 --> 01:02:16,074
Well, the thing is,
I was wondering if she's

769
01:02:17,817 --> 01:02:20,286
ever mentioned me.

770
01:02:21,696 --> 01:02:23,790
Does she ever mention me?

771
01:02:25,075 --> 01:02:28,500
Let me think.
No, never.

772
01:02:29,371 --> 01:02:30,964
Actually, yes.

773
01:02:31,456 --> 01:02:34,710
She mentioned you had invested
in a new shirt last term.

774
01:02:34,918 --> 01:02:37,341
Splashed out at Nicole Farhi.

775
01:02:39,005 --> 01:02:44,478
Thing is, over the last few months... Well,
ever since I met her, really, I've...

776
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:48,436
Brian, are you in love?

777
01:02:49,975 --> 01:02:52,244
I've been a bit bloody
obvious, haven't I?

778
01:02:52,270 --> 01:02:54,221
You've been utterly
clandestine.

779
01:02:55,897 --> 01:02:58,867
- So she mentioned the shirt?
- You do know she's married?

780
01:02:58,984 --> 01:03:02,363
Yeah, but she's quite flirty, and you
never know with people, do you?

781
01:03:02,487 --> 01:03:05,741
- Indeed you don't.
- But...

782
01:03:06,032 --> 01:03:09,707
I wouldn't wanna make a move
if I'm just gonna get knocked back.

783
01:03:09,995 --> 01:03:14,501
What with staff politics and the head being
such a stickler, you have to be careful.

784
01:03:14,708 --> 01:03:16,255
It's a minefield.

785
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:18,720
So would...

786
01:03:19,879 --> 01:03:23,634
I mean, do you think you
could have a word with her

787
01:03:23,883 --> 01:03:27,353
and just suss the lie of the land?

788
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:35,438
You'd like me to ask Mrs. Hart if she's
inclined to commit adultery with you?

789
01:03:38,523 --> 01:03:43,620
I don't want you to suffer more
than is necessary. No one should.

790
01:03:43,695 --> 01:03:49,748
I couldn't possibly speak for
Mrs. Hart, but instinct tells me

791
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:51,624
you might not be her type.

792
01:03:53,413 --> 01:03:56,166
She's got a type, then?

793
01:03:56,249 --> 01:03:59,753
Oh, it's no reflection
on your attractiveness.

794
01:04:00,545 --> 01:04:06,393
But my impression is that her
preference is for the younger man.

795
01:04:08,803 --> 01:04:11,556
Surprisingly young.

796
01:04:12,057 --> 01:04:13,604
Boys, I'm told.

797
01:04:15,143 --> 01:04:18,192
Naturally, she doesn't discuss
any of this with me.

798
01:04:18,563 --> 01:04:21,942
But I've been hearing some rather
alarming rumours about one in particular.

799
01:04:23,610 --> 01:04:27,080
Playground gossip, staff
room whispers and so on.

800
01:04:29,991 --> 01:04:32,961
You might know the boy in question.

01:04:36,331 --> 01:04:38,049

It's the thinking that
takes an eternity.

828

But you're never satisfied. When you're
lecturing, you long for time to write,

What the hell is going on?

843
01:07:31,589 --> 01:07:34,638
You ask your wife what's going on!
Ask her!

844
01:07:34,717 --> 01:07:38,062

Come on, Maggie. Leave them alone.

Come on. Leave them alone, eh?

848
01:07:50,024 --> 01:07:52,152
There's nothing for us here.

849
01:08:10,211 --> 01:08:12,964
It happened.
It just happened.

You think you're the only one
who's wanted someone young?

852

Everyone sometimes,
everyone thinks about...

853
01:08:21,222 --> 01:08:23,771
But they deal with it!

01:08:24,309 --> 01:08:27,313
By the time I took my
seat in the gods,

855

its final act.

- And you were mine!

I'm not trying to justify it!

He's 16 in May.
He's not some innocent...

861
01:08:44,018 --> 01:08:45,857
Of course he's innocent!

862
01:08:45,913 --> 01:08:48,587
He's fucking 15!

863
01:08:48,666 --> 01:08:50,714
Are you insane?

864
01:08:50,793 --> 01:08:55,424
If you meant to destroy us, why not do it
with an adult? That's the convention.

865
01:08:55,506 --> 01:08:59,477
- It's worked for centuries.
- It wasn't about us. It...

866
01:08:59,552 --> 01:09:02,681
- Why?
- I just wanted him.

867
01:09:02,764 --> 01:09:05,438
- Why?
- I don't know!

868
01:09:05,683 --> 01:09:07,230
Well, find out!

869
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:30,421
- Sheba? And... No!
- Yep. Connolly, yes. Yes, honestly.

Brian.

875
01:09:51,854 --> 01:09:54,027
Brian, do stop a minute, please.

876
01:09:54,107 --> 01:09:56,451
<i>Today, St George's School
is a solemn place.</i>

877
01:09:56,526 --> 01:09:59,200
<i>A source close to the
school has indicated</i>

878
01:09:59,278 --> 01:10:02,623
<i>another member of staff may have
known of the relationship.</i>

879
01:10:02,699 --> 01:10:07,626
<i>This, however, is categorically
denied by the local authority.</i>

880
01:10:07,704 --> 01:10:12,175
Had I known anything, I would
have informed you immediately.

881
01:10:12,250 --> 01:10:13,843
My loyalty is to the school.

882
01:10:13,918 --> 01:10:16,592
- Brian thinks you've known for months.
- Brian!

883
01:10:16,671 --> 01:10:20,096
- Then there is Sue...
- Will you run through the entire staff?

884
01:10:20,174 --> 01:10:23,929
If you knew and turned a blind eye,
you have enabled a crime.

885
01:10:24,011 --> 01:10:27,390
- I didn't, so I haven't.
- You're due for retirement next year.

886
01:10:27,473 --> 01:10:30,727
I think it would benefit everyone
if you take it early.

887

I've a radical idea. Your school,
your disaster. Why don't you resign?

890
01:10:41,028 --> 01:10:44,999
Because I am not the
confidante of a criminal!

891
01:10:45,825 --> 01:10:48,544
Now, tell me about your
friendship with Mrs. Hart.

892
01:10:48,619 --> 01:10:52,749
I think you'll find a close friendship
between consenting adults is legal,

893
01:10:52,832 --> 01:10:54,926
even under your regime.

894
01:10:55,168 --> 01:11:00,015
My record is beyond reproach. The majority
of the staff regard me as a moral guardian.

895
01:11:00,089 --> 01:11:06,062
I've just spoken to an ex-member of our
staff, another of your "close" friends.

Jennifer Dodd.

897
01:11:11,017 --> 01:11:16,239
As you are aware, Jennifer became unwell.
That's why she had to leave the school.

898
01:11:16,314 --> 01:11:19,158
Jennifer threatened you
with a restraining order.

899
01:11:19,233 --> 01:11:21,361
That's nonsense.

900
01:11:22,528 --> 01:11:29,002
A fax from her solicitor. She didn't
want you within 500 yards of her by law!

901
01:11:29,076 --> 01:11:30,794
You call that a friendship?

902
01:11:30,995 --> 01:11:35,045
She told me that you sent her
fiancé a wreath!

903
01:11:38,211 --> 01:11:42,136
Now, we wouldn't want all this
to come out, would we?

904
01:11:42,215 --> 01:11:47,312

01:22:04,086 --> 01:22:08,808
You're lonely for a reason. They
loathed you at school, all of them.

1008
01:22:08,882 --> 01:22:13,137
I was the idiot who bothered, but only
because no one told me you're a vampire!

1009
01:22:13,220 --> 01:22:16,599
So what is it, Bar? You wanna roll
around the floor like lovers?

1010
01:22:16,682 --> 01:22:19,777
- You wanna fuck me?
- Please don't diminish our...

1011
01:22:19,852 --> 01:22:22,822
- Our what? What?
- No! Give it back.

1012
01:22:22,896 --> 01:22:28,027
I... I know you. Selfish and vain,
you think you have a divine right.

1013
01:22:28,110 --> 01:22:32,035
You don't belong in the world,
you belong here! You big baby!

1014
01:22:32,197 --> 01:22:34,199
(REPORTERS SHOUTING)

1015
01:22:35,534 --> 01:22:38,162
Here I am!

1016
01:22:40,747 --> 01:22:43,751
Here I am!

1017
01:23:25,083 --> 01:23:29,088
We never invited you
to the fucking Dordogne.

1018
01:23:30,756 --> 01:23:35,353
I'm sorry, but you specifically said if I
happened to be in France I should drop in.

1019
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:37,771
We didn't mean it.

1020
01:23:39,014 --> 01:23:41,108
Well, fine.

1021
01:23:42,726 --> 01:23:44,979
I won't come, then.

1022
01:23:46,438 --> 01:23:49,282
I asked you to lunch
because I liked you.

1023
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:53,028
I would have been your friend.

1024
01:24:00,869 --> 01:24:03,122
I need more than a friend.

1025
01:26:21,385 --> 01:26:23,137
(BARBARA) I knew her.

1026
01:26:23,387 --> 01:26:25,435
Sorry?

1027
01:26:25,639 --> 01:26:28,142
- I knew her.
- Really?

1028
01:26:28,392 --> 01:26:29,735
Mm.

1029
01:26:29,976 --> 01:26:33,321
- We taught at the same school.
- God.

1030
01:26:33,772 --> 01:26:36,116
What was she like?

1031
01:26:36,733 --> 01:26:38,610
A bit

1032
01:26:39,194 --> 01:26:40,946
chilly.

1033
01:26:42,239 --> 01:26:44,458
A touch furtive.

1034
01:26:46,618 --> 01:26:49,041
A sort of absent person.

1035
01:26:50,789 --> 01:26:53,713
Oh, but I didn't know her well.
May I?

1036
01:26:53,792 --> 01:26:55,886
Mm-hm.

1037
01:27:01,758 --> 01:27:04,181
- Do you still teach?
- No, no.

1038
01:27:05,095 --> 01:27:07,189
Retired.

1039
01:27:08,265 --> 01:27:10,313
Thank goodness.

1040
01:27:11,935 --> 01:27:14,814
- You...
- Oh. (LAUGHS)

1041
01:27:15,564 --> 01:27:18,488
- Here.
- Thanks.

1042
01:27:24,364 --> 01:27:27,038
- I love it here.
- Mm.

1043
01:27:27,117 --> 01:27:30,166
(BARBARA)
It's spectacular at dusk.

1044
01:27:35,876 --> 01:27:37,753
I'm Barbara.

1045
01:27:44,634 --> 01:27:46,181
Annabel.

1046
01:27:51,016 --> 01:27:54,190
I wonder, Annabel,

1047
01:27:54,269 --> 01:27:56,613
- do you like music?
- Oh, yes.

1048
01:27:56,688 --> 01:28:01,194
It's just that I've got tickets for
Handel's Water Music at the Albert Hall

1049
01:28:01,276 --> 01:28:02,448
on Saturday night.

1050
01:28:02,527 --> 01:28:05,121
You could bring a friend
if there's someone...

1051
01:28:05,363 --> 01:28:07,661
Oh, no.
Oh, no. There isn't.

1052
01:28:07,741 --> 01:28:10,210
(BARBARA) Well, there we are.
