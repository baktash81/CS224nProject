Uh, what price can you put
on a dream?. A hotel...

319
00:22:40,592 --> 00:22:46,360

eat and you sleep; it's a place
where dreams come true.

to the next section.

A hotel like none that
has ever existed, and it's
already built, in here.

Two years ago, I got a tip
on an incredible property
on Roosevelt Island.

views of Manhattan. I got a
two-year option for 40 grand.

in the last five years. I got
one month to get this rollin'...

to the city, and I'm screwed.
- How much to get it from here?.

327
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:19,423

start. Now before you say
no, sir, I sketched out...

328
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:22,729

and it's foolproof;
just read this.

Nothing is foolproof.

Contingent upon a small public

- Handicap ramps, bathrooms.
