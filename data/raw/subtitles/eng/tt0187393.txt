1
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:07,592
<i>I have long feared...</i>

2
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:12,013
<i>...that my sins would return
to visit me.</i>

3
00:01:13,264 --> 00:01:16,142
<i>And the cost is more than I can bear.</i>

4
00:01:44,129 --> 00:01:46,172
Samuel! A postrider!

5
00:01:57,308 --> 00:01:58,309
An "R."

6
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,727
Good.

7
00:02:01,563 --> 00:02:02,730
What about this one?

8
00:02:41,269 --> 00:02:43,146
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

9
00:03:25,647 --> 00:03:28,107
Father! Father!

10
00:03:29,525 --> 00:03:33,446
Nine pounds, eleven ounces.
That's perfect. Perfect.

11
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,990
Father, a postrider!

12
00:03:36,699 --> 00:03:38,201
Did you finish planting
the field?

13
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:39,661
More than half.

14
00:03:39,911 --> 00:03:43,247
Those swimming breaks really cut
into the day, don't they?

15
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:46,834
Told you.

16
00:03:57,261 --> 00:03:58,513
Thomas.

17
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:00,098
Wait for Father.

18
00:05:00,158 --> 00:05:01,159
Sorry.

19
00:05:33,524 --> 00:05:37,069
That's her. The North Star.

20
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:39,572
See?

21
00:05:39,947 --> 00:05:43,201
You start from the front two stars
of the Big Dipper.

22
00:05:43,868 --> 00:05:45,286
And then you count up.

23
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:48,748
You count up five finger lengths...

24
00:05:48,998 --> 00:05:51,667
...and it's right there.

25
00:05:53,002 --> 00:05:55,838
And she'll always be
looking down on us.

26
00:05:56,172 --> 00:05:59,258
And protect us. Forever.

27
00:06:01,302 --> 00:06:02,845
Come. Into bed.

28
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:12,897
Good night. Good night, Meg.

29
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:17,360
It helps her to know Mother's there.

30
00:06:21,906 --> 00:06:22,949
Good night.

31
00:07:05,032 --> 00:07:06,992
So what was in the mail?

32
00:07:18,754 --> 00:07:21,215
"The New York and
Pennsylvania assemblies...

33
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,676
...are debating independence. "

34
00:07:23,884 --> 00:07:26,429
What about the middle colonies?

35
00:07:29,056 --> 00:07:31,350
"In Chestertown,
they burned the customs house...

36
00:07:31,559 --> 00:07:33,853
...and tar and feathered
two magistrates.

37
00:07:34,228 --> 00:07:36,522
They died of... They died of burns. "

38
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:38,774
Damn fools.

39
00:07:38,983 --> 00:07:42,194
Who? The writers or the magistrates?

40
00:07:42,903 --> 00:07:45,906
What does it say about
the Continental Congress?

41
00:07:48,659 --> 00:07:53,205
It says here they'll make
a declaration of independence by July.

42
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,683
Peter Cuppin joined the Continentals.

43
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:21,484
He's 17, a year younger than I.

44
00:08:32,244 --> 00:08:36,290
Well, the assembly's been convened,
so I've been called to Charles Town.

45
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:38,500
- We're going to Charles Town?
- We are.

46
00:08:38,876 --> 00:08:40,127
We leave in the morning.

47
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:24,296
Charlotte.

48
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,465
The children are here.

49
00:09:29,593 --> 00:09:31,679
Thank you.

50
00:09:36,433 --> 00:09:37,810
Aunt Charlotte!

51
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:40,896
Margaret, William, look at you.

52
00:09:41,939 --> 00:09:43,440
Missed you.

53
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:46,819
They're huge.
What have you been feeding them?

54
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:51,156
Well, they're from good stock.
On their mother's side, of course.

55
00:09:52,199 --> 00:09:55,661
Thank you. Come inside.
Wait until you see what I have.

56
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:58,455
- Presents? Presents for us?
- Move slowly.

57
00:09:58,664 --> 00:10:01,125
Keep an eye on these heathens,
will you?

58
00:10:03,627 --> 00:10:04,628
Sorry.

59
00:10:12,803 --> 00:10:16,849
I have this for you, Susan.
It belonged to your mother.

60
00:10:23,021 --> 00:10:25,065
She's still not talking?

61
00:10:26,567 --> 00:10:27,901
No.

62
00:10:30,821 --> 00:10:32,614
It does me good to see you.

63
00:10:49,131 --> 00:10:50,549
Look, there's Gabriel.

64
00:10:50,716 --> 00:10:52,843
Gabriel.

65
00:10:58,223 --> 00:10:59,975
Hang King George!

66
00:11:08,025 --> 00:11:10,152
Harry Burwell is here recruiting.

67
00:11:10,402 --> 00:11:13,363
The governor has vowed if the
assembly votes a single shilling...

68
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:16,366
...to the Continental Army,
he'll dissolve the body.

69
00:11:18,243 --> 00:11:22,956
Wouldn't that force our delegates in
Philadelphia to vote for independence?

70
00:11:23,165 --> 00:11:24,958
Yes.

71
00:11:25,626 --> 00:11:29,213
Send us off to war alongside
Massachusetts.

72
00:11:31,298 --> 00:11:34,301
Get King George!

73
00:11:34,968 --> 00:11:38,055
- Hang them all!
- Hang the lot of them!

74
00:11:39,556 --> 00:11:41,600
That's enough.
Very well, children, inside.

75
00:11:41,808 --> 00:11:45,145
Come along now. Inside now.

76
00:11:54,529 --> 00:11:57,241
Burwell will be counting on your vote.

77
00:11:57,407 --> 00:12:00,786
And he'll expect you
to be the first to enlist.

78
00:12:00,994 --> 00:12:03,664
Yes, I imagine so.

79
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:09,127
I'm sorry, the heathens are...

80
00:12:11,046 --> 00:12:13,257
They have long needed
a woman in their lives.

81
00:12:14,341 --> 00:12:15,801
A mother.

82
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:18,262
Especially Susan.

83
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:32,067
My name is Peter Howard.

84
00:12:32,734 --> 00:12:36,238
I lost most of my hearing
and my left leg...

85
00:12:36,697 --> 00:12:40,117
...fighting for the Crown
in the French and Indian War.

86
00:12:40,826 --> 00:12:43,537
And how did King George reward me?

87
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:46,540
He cuts off my other leg
with his taxes.

88
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:49,793
Miss Howard, isn't it?

89
00:12:51,044 --> 00:12:52,921
You know who I am, Gabriel Martin.

90
00:12:54,506 --> 00:12:58,552
The last time you saw me,
I was 11 and you put ink in my tea.

91
00:12:59,428 --> 00:13:03,682
I believe that was one of my younger
brothers. Perhaps Samuel or Nathan.

92
00:13:04,182 --> 00:13:08,311
It was you, and it turned
my teeth black for a month.

93
00:13:10,856 --> 00:13:15,652
- and send a message to King George
he will never forget!

94
00:13:17,946 --> 00:13:19,322
Our first order of business...

95
00:13:19,573 --> 00:13:21,450
And our last, if we vote a levy!

96
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:23,035
Order, order!

97
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,245
Mr. Simms, you do not have the floor.

98
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:29,708
First, an address by Colonel
Harry Burwell of the Continental Army.

99
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:31,293
Colonel Burwell.

100
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:37,257
You all know why I'm here.

101
00:13:37,758 --> 00:13:39,509
I'm not an orator.

102
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:44,473
And I would not try to convince you
of the worthiness of our cause.

103
00:13:45,807 --> 00:13:47,350
I'm a soldier.

104
00:13:48,143 --> 00:13:50,270
And we are at war.

105
00:13:50,979 --> 00:13:54,441
From Philadelphia, we expect
a declaration of independence.

106
00:13:55,317 --> 00:13:57,778
8 of the 13 colonies have
levied money...

107
00:13:57,986 --> 00:14:00,113
...in support of a continental army.

108
00:14:00,572 --> 00:14:02,783
I ask that South Carolina be the ninth.

109
00:14:03,492 --> 00:14:06,661
Massachusetts and Virginia
may be at war...

110
00:14:06,953 --> 00:14:09,039
...but South Carolina is not!

111
00:14:09,289 --> 00:14:10,290
Hear, hear.

112
00:14:10,624 --> 00:14:14,669
This is not a war for the independence
of one or two colonies...

113
00:14:15,003 --> 00:14:17,214
...but for the independence
of one nation.

114
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:19,466
And what nation is that?

115
00:14:19,716 --> 00:14:21,927
An American nation!

116
00:14:22,135 --> 00:14:24,679
There is no such nation
and to speak of one is treason.

117
00:14:24,971 --> 00:14:27,807
We are citizens
of an American nation.

118
00:14:28,099 --> 00:14:30,727
And our rights are being threatened...

119
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:33,480
...by a tyrant 3000 miles away.

120
00:14:33,772 --> 00:14:36,149
Would you tell me, please,
Mr. Howard...

121
00:14:36,441 --> 00:14:40,278
...why should I trade one tyrant
3000 miles away...

122
00:14:40,529 --> 00:14:43,406
...for 3000 tyrants one mile away?

123
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:52,666
An elected legislature can trample
a man's rights as easily as a king can.

124
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:55,210
Captain Martin...

125
00:14:56,753 --> 00:14:58,463
...I understood you to be a patriot.

126
00:14:59,005 --> 00:15:02,592
If you mean by "patriot," am I angry
about taxation without representation?

127
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:04,094
Well, yes, I am.

128
00:15:05,178 --> 00:15:09,474
Should the American colonies govern
themselves independently?

129
00:15:09,849 --> 00:15:12,644
I believe they can. And they should.

130
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:17,107
But if you're asking me am I willing
to go to war with England...

131
00:15:17,357 --> 00:15:19,943
...then the answer is
most definitely no.

132
00:15:24,447 --> 00:15:28,702
This from the same Captain Benjamin
Martin whose fury was so famous...

133
00:15:29,119 --> 00:15:30,996
...during the Wilderness campaign?

134
00:15:32,414 --> 00:15:34,207
I was intemperate in my youth.

135
00:15:34,457 --> 00:15:36,334
Temperance can be
a disguise for fear.

136
00:15:37,127 --> 00:15:40,005
Mr. Middleton, I fought
with Captain Martin...

137
00:15:40,213 --> 00:15:42,882
...under Washington
in the French and Indian War.

138
00:15:43,591 --> 00:15:45,176
There's not a man in this room...

139
00:15:45,385 --> 00:15:49,597
...or anywhere for that matter, to whom
I would more willingly trust my life.

140
00:15:50,598 --> 00:15:52,809
There are alternatives to war.

141
00:15:54,102 --> 00:15:56,062
We take our case before the king.

142
00:15:56,271 --> 00:15:57,731
- We plead with him.
- We tried.

143
00:15:57,939 --> 00:16:01,443
Well, then, we try again and again
if necessary to avoid a war.

144
00:16:02,485 --> 00:16:04,446
I was at Bunker Hill.

145
00:16:05,321 --> 00:16:07,365
The British advanced three times.

146
00:16:07,657 --> 00:16:11,661
We killed 700 at point-blank range
and still they took the ground.

147
00:16:12,078 --> 00:16:14,956
That is the measure of their resolve.

148
00:16:15,957 --> 00:16:18,251
If your principles dictate
independence...

149
00:16:18,334 --> 00:16:20,795
...then war is the only way.

150
00:16:21,296 --> 00:16:22,881
It is come to that.

151
00:16:23,089 --> 00:16:24,591
Hear, hear.

152
00:16:26,676 --> 00:16:28,595
I have seven children.

153
00:16:29,345 --> 00:16:30,847
My wife is dead.

154
00:16:32,682 --> 00:16:34,893
Now, who's to care for them
if I go to war?

155
00:16:37,437 --> 00:16:40,690
Wars are not fought
only by childless men.

156
00:16:41,274 --> 00:16:42,567
Granted.

157
00:16:45,445 --> 00:16:47,447
But mark my words.

158
00:16:49,616 --> 00:16:53,620
This war will be fought,
not on the frontier...

159
00:16:53,787 --> 00:16:56,623
...or on some distant battlefield...

160
00:16:57,665 --> 00:16:59,292
...but amongst us.

161
00:16:59,501 --> 00:17:01,461
Among our homes.

162
00:17:02,587 --> 00:17:05,590
Our children will learn of it
with their own eyes.

163
00:17:08,676 --> 00:17:11,513
And the innocent will die
with the rest of us.

164
00:17:15,517 --> 00:17:17,101
I will not fight.

165
00:17:18,144 --> 00:17:20,897
And because I will not fight,
I will not cast a vote...

166
00:17:21,147 --> 00:17:23,900
...that will send others to fight
in my stead.

167
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:28,112
And your principles?

168
00:17:31,658 --> 00:17:34,828
I'm a parent. I haven't got
the luxury of principles.

169
00:17:43,837 --> 00:17:45,630
We must vote to levy!

170
00:18:00,186 --> 00:18:02,605
28 to 12! The levy passed!

171
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,721
You intend to enlist
without my permission?

172
00:18:35,346 --> 00:18:36,806
Yes, I do.

173
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:46,399
Father, I thought you were
a man of principle.

174
00:18:50,445 --> 00:18:53,698
When you have a family of your own,
perhaps you'll understand.

175
00:18:56,409 --> 00:18:59,579
When I have a family of my own,
I won't hide behind them.

176
00:19:15,845 --> 00:19:19,682
He's as imprudent as his father was
at his age.

177
00:19:20,099 --> 00:19:21,726
Regrettably so.

178
00:19:23,686 --> 00:19:26,230
I'll see to it that he
serves under me.

179
00:19:27,273 --> 00:19:31,444
Make him a clerk or quartermaster,
something of that sort.

180
00:19:33,946 --> 00:19:35,406
Good luck.

181
00:20:00,389 --> 00:20:02,850
<i>Dear Thomas:
Though many seasons have passed...</i>

182
00:20:03,059 --> 00:20:07,313
<i>...it seems like only yesterday when we
last saw each other in Charles Town.</i>

183
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:11,067
<i>With sadness, I learned
of its recent fall to the British...</i>

184
00:20:11,317 --> 00:20:12,944
<i>...under General Cornwallis.</i>

185
00:20:17,114 --> 00:20:19,116
<i>I received a letter
from Aunt Charlotte...</i>

186
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,787
<i>...saying she closed her home
in Charles Town after the city fell...</i>

187
00:20:22,954 --> 00:20:25,873
<i>...and moved to her plantation
on the Santee.</i>

188
00:20:36,175 --> 00:20:40,805
<i>Here in the north, our campaign has
been marked by defeat and privation.</i>

189
00:20:42,515 --> 00:20:44,642
<i>Our losses have been grievous.</i>

190
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:55,194
<i>My good friend, Peter Cuppin,
fell at Elizabethtown.</i>

191
00:21:01,951 --> 00:21:04,662
<i>His death has been difficult to bear.</i>

192
00:21:17,592 --> 00:21:20,011
<i>We will march south
with General Gates...</i>

193
00:21:20,261 --> 00:21:23,055
<i>...to fight the Redcoats
under Cornwallis.</i>

194
00:21:26,183 --> 00:21:27,184
Thank you, sir.

195
00:21:41,073 --> 00:21:42,617
<i>I envy you...</i>

196
00:21:42,867 --> 00:21:47,330
<i>...your youth and distance from this
cruel conflict of which I am a part.</i>

197
00:21:48,789 --> 00:21:51,584
"But I am fortunate to be
serving the cause of Liberty.

198
00:21:53,002 --> 00:21:54,962
And though I fear death...

199
00:21:55,129 --> 00:21:57,923
...each day in prayer I reaffirm
my willingness...

200
00:21:58,132 --> 00:22:00,343
...to give my life in its service.

201
00:22:01,385 --> 00:22:02,428
Pray for me.

202
00:22:04,096 --> 00:22:06,474
But above all, pray for the cause.

203
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,477
Your loving brother, Gabriel. "

204
00:22:45,763 --> 00:22:46,764
What are you doing?

205
00:22:53,521 --> 00:22:54,814
Turn around.

206
00:22:59,777 --> 00:23:01,821
Not yet, Thomas.

207
00:23:02,279 --> 00:23:03,280
When?

208
00:23:08,452 --> 00:23:09,453
Seventeen.

209
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,833
That's two years.
It's already been two.

210
00:23:14,083 --> 00:23:17,086
- The war could be over by then.
- God willing.

211
00:23:21,382 --> 00:23:24,051
All right. Seventeen.

212
00:23:27,513 --> 00:23:28,681
All right.

213
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:37,731
Put it back, please.

214
00:23:41,902 --> 00:23:43,362
Father?

215
00:23:44,613 --> 00:23:46,907
What happened at Fort Wilderness?

216
00:23:50,202 --> 00:23:51,453
Put it away.

217
00:23:57,501 --> 00:24:00,921
- Throw it faster.
- You throw it faster. You're the one...

218
00:24:12,975 --> 00:24:16,478
Margaret, you go get your brothers
back up here right now.

219
00:25:21,585 --> 00:25:25,047
Back to the house. Come on.
Back to the house now.

220
00:25:25,381 --> 00:25:29,301
Come with me. Margaret, go now.

221
00:25:36,642 --> 00:25:37,893
They're going to come.

222
00:25:38,143 --> 00:25:40,979
Quiet. Sit down.

223
00:26:12,636 --> 00:26:14,138
Six-pounders.

224
00:26:14,638 --> 00:26:15,639
Lots of them.

225
00:26:16,598 --> 00:26:17,891
How far away?

226
00:26:18,892 --> 00:26:22,813
They're a long way off. They're most
likely heading the other direction.

227
00:26:24,648 --> 00:26:26,233
Put those in the house.

228
00:26:26,733 --> 00:26:29,194
- They might come this way.
- Must I tell you again?

229
00:26:32,698 --> 00:26:35,576
Let's all stay close in to the house,
all right?

230
00:26:55,762 --> 00:26:57,139
We'll have to fight them off.

231
00:26:57,514 --> 00:26:59,224
Won't Father do that?

232
00:27:00,267 --> 00:27:02,644
They'll probably kill us men...

233
00:27:04,521 --> 00:27:06,648
...and do Lord-knows-what
to you women.

234
00:27:06,899 --> 00:27:08,483
Nathan!

235
00:27:35,052 --> 00:27:36,345
Slowly turn.

236
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,141
Father.

237
00:27:44,436 --> 00:27:45,729
Abigale!

238
00:27:46,521 --> 00:27:48,148
Water and bandages, fast.

239
00:27:52,986 --> 00:27:54,696
The battle. Were you there?

240
00:27:55,364 --> 00:27:56,948
Have you seen any Redcoats?

241
00:27:57,199 --> 00:27:58,742
No, not yet.

242
00:27:59,034 --> 00:28:01,495
Abigale, the children, please.

243
00:28:01,787 --> 00:28:04,164
Children, come. Upstairs.

244
00:28:09,961 --> 00:28:12,339
Gates marched us straight
at the Redcoats.

245
00:28:12,547 --> 00:28:16,301
Our lines broke. The British
Green Dragoons cut us to bits.

246
00:28:16,551 --> 00:28:18,762
I was given these dispatches.

247
00:28:19,179 --> 00:28:22,933
As I left, I saw
the Virginia Regulars surrender.

248
00:28:26,144 --> 00:28:28,063
The Dragoons rode into them.

249
00:28:29,815 --> 00:28:30,816
Killed them all.

250
00:28:32,192 --> 00:28:33,819
Over 200 men.

251
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,863
I have to get these dispatches
to Hillsborough.

252
00:28:37,114 --> 00:28:38,281
You can't ride.

253
00:28:38,532 --> 00:28:40,742
I can't stay here!
It's not safe for...

254
00:29:14,109 --> 00:29:15,569
Fire!

255
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:25,370
Fire!

256
00:31:49,139 --> 00:31:51,558
Thank you for the care
of His Majesty's soldiers.

257
00:32:22,839 --> 00:32:25,842
Have a detachment take our wounded
to our surgeons at Winnsboro.

258
00:32:26,384 --> 00:32:27,469
Yes, sir.

259
00:32:29,345 --> 00:32:30,513
Fire the house and barns.

260
00:32:32,974 --> 00:32:36,144
Let it be known if you harbor
the enemy you will lose your home.

261
00:32:40,231 --> 00:32:42,108
By order of King George...

262
00:32:42,317 --> 00:32:45,737
...all slaves of the American colonies
who fight for the Crown...

263
00:32:46,029 --> 00:32:49,365
...will be granted their freedom
with our victory.

264
00:32:51,367 --> 00:32:54,954
We're not slaves. We work this land.
We're freedmen.

265
00:32:55,163 --> 00:32:58,249
Then you're freedmen who will have
the privilege...

266
00:32:58,499 --> 00:33:00,627
...of fighting in the king's army.

267
00:33:06,591 --> 00:33:08,384
Rebel dispatches, sir.

268
00:33:14,849 --> 00:33:16,226
Who carried this?

269
00:33:25,401 --> 00:33:26,444
Who carried this?!

270
00:33:27,487 --> 00:33:28,529
I did, sir.

271
00:33:35,453 --> 00:33:37,413
I was wounded.
These people gave me care.

272
00:33:38,456 --> 00:33:40,833
They have nothing to do
with the dispatches.

273
00:33:43,795 --> 00:33:45,672
Take this one to Camden.
He is a spy.

274
00:33:45,922 --> 00:33:48,049
Hang him, put his body on display.

275
00:33:48,591 --> 00:33:50,426
He's a dispatch rider.

276
00:33:50,677 --> 00:33:53,346
Destroy the livestock.
Save the horses for the Dragoons.

277
00:33:54,097 --> 00:33:57,934
Colonel, this is a uniformed
dispatch rider carrying a marked case.

278
00:33:58,142 --> 00:33:59,477
He cannot be held as a spy.

279
00:33:59,686 --> 00:34:02,397
Well, we won't hold him.
We're going to hang him.

280
00:34:05,984 --> 00:34:07,527
- Colonel...
- Father!

281
00:34:10,947 --> 00:34:13,908
Oh, I see. He's your son.

282
00:34:14,909 --> 00:34:17,787
Perhaps you should've taught him
something of loyalty.

283
00:34:19,122 --> 00:34:23,334
Colonel, I beg you, please reconsider.
By the rules of war...

284
00:34:23,543 --> 00:34:27,130
Would you like a lesson, sir,
in the rules of war?

285
00:34:30,049 --> 00:34:31,759
Or perhaps your children would.

286
00:34:36,889 --> 00:34:38,391
No lesson is necessary.

287
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:42,562
Sir.

288
00:34:42,854 --> 00:34:44,647
What of the rebel wounded?

289
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:48,401
Kill them.

290
00:34:53,364 --> 00:34:54,449
Father.

291
00:34:58,578 --> 00:35:00,288
Father, do something!

292
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:01,581
Be quiet!

293
00:35:14,385 --> 00:35:16,262
Gabriel, run!

294
00:35:17,388 --> 00:35:18,389
Wait!

295
00:35:21,142 --> 00:35:22,393
No!

296
00:35:48,961 --> 00:35:50,838
Stupid boy.

297
00:35:56,844 --> 00:35:58,095
Captain.

298
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:04,727
Thomas!

299
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:01,450
Come, child.

300
00:37:03,244 --> 00:37:05,705
I'm not leaving these children!

301
00:37:05,913 --> 00:37:07,290
Mercy!

302
00:37:08,541 --> 00:37:10,084
Get ready!

303
00:37:10,251 --> 00:37:11,252
Present!

304
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:12,545
Fire!

305
00:37:56,756 --> 00:37:58,174
All of you, stay here.

306
00:38:33,584 --> 00:38:35,044
Nathan, Samuel.

307
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,008
Margaret.

308
00:38:43,427 --> 00:38:45,971
Hide in the fields
with William and Susan.

309
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:49,016
If we're not back by sunset,
take them to Aunt Charlotte's.

310
00:38:49,183 --> 00:38:51,560
- Is that clear?
- Yeah.

311
00:38:52,228 --> 00:38:53,312
Boys.

312
00:39:46,699 --> 00:39:47,950
It's a good spot.

313
00:39:49,368 --> 00:39:51,495
Boys, listen to me.

314
00:39:51,996 --> 00:39:53,706
I'll fire first.

315
00:39:55,791 --> 00:39:58,711
Start with the officers
and work your way down.

316
00:39:58,919 --> 00:40:00,587
Can you tell the difference?

317
00:40:00,796 --> 00:40:01,630
Yes, Father.

318
00:40:02,089 --> 00:40:03,716
- Yes, Father.
- Good.

319
00:40:04,466 --> 00:40:06,844
Samuel, after your first shot,
reload for Nathan.

320
00:40:08,137 --> 00:40:09,138
Now...

321
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:12,057
...if anything should happen to me,
drop your weapons.

322
00:40:12,391 --> 00:40:14,018
Run as quickly as you can.

323
00:40:14,143 --> 00:40:16,729
Get your brother and your sisters...

324
00:40:16,937 --> 00:40:19,690
...and take them to
Aunt Charlotte's. Understood?

325
00:40:21,233 --> 00:40:22,860
What did I say about shooting?

326
00:40:23,402 --> 00:40:24,570
Aim small, miss small.

327
00:40:25,154 --> 00:40:26,864
Aim small, miss small.

328
00:40:28,073 --> 00:40:29,241
Boys...

329
00:40:29,742 --> 00:40:31,076
...Samuel...

330
00:40:31,452 --> 00:40:32,786
...steady.

331
00:41:20,334 --> 00:41:22,795
Lord, make me fast and accurate.

332
00:41:24,338 --> 00:41:26,715
Aim small, miss small.

333
00:41:26,965 --> 00:41:29,718
Aim small, miss small.

334
00:41:29,968 --> 00:41:32,679
Aim small, miss small.

335
00:41:46,443 --> 00:41:47,986
- On the right!
- To the left!

336
00:41:54,243 --> 00:41:56,328
Behind us! Up on the ridge!

337
00:42:00,833 --> 00:42:02,167
Form right!

338
00:42:04,169 --> 00:42:05,170
To the right!

339
00:42:07,297 --> 00:42:08,674
About face!

340
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:13,011
On the right to the rear!

341
00:42:14,346 --> 00:42:15,847
To the right!

342
00:42:16,014 --> 00:42:17,015
Fire!

343
00:42:18,225 --> 00:42:20,310
- Reload!
- Reload!

344
00:42:39,621 --> 00:42:40,998
Behind you!

345
00:42:45,919 --> 00:42:47,421
Look on the rear!

346
00:47:15,313 --> 00:47:16,439
Lord...

347
00:47:17,690 --> 00:47:20,401
...we pray that you accept this child...

348
00:47:20,568 --> 00:47:23,571
...and keep him at your side
with his mother.

349
00:47:24,739 --> 00:47:27,492
We ask that you embrace him...

350
00:47:29,786 --> 00:47:34,165
...and help us to understand the
manner in which your mercy works.

351
00:47:34,666 --> 00:47:37,502
And forgive us our sins.

352
00:47:37,669 --> 00:47:40,839
This we ask in your name.

353
00:47:41,005 --> 00:47:42,799
Amen.

354
00:48:07,782 --> 00:48:10,660
Sir, we have the private
the Cherokee scouts brought in.

355
00:48:22,130 --> 00:48:23,548
Private?

356
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:24,841
Private.

357
00:48:25,091 --> 00:48:27,051
Colonel William Tavington,
Green Dragoons.

358
00:48:27,969 --> 00:48:30,263
What happened? Who did this?

359
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:32,265
Him.

360
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:35,018
It was mad.

361
00:48:35,894 --> 00:48:37,520
I couldn't tell you who it was.

362
00:48:37,770 --> 00:48:39,814
Calm down. Calm down, man.

363
00:48:40,481 --> 00:48:43,318
Twenty of His Majesty's soldiers
are dead.

364
00:48:43,526 --> 00:48:45,904
And I need to know how.

365
00:48:46,112 --> 00:48:48,197
- He said there was...
- Were you there?

366
00:48:48,781 --> 00:48:50,825
Then let him speak.

367
00:48:51,326 --> 00:48:54,829
Take your time and tell me.
How many were there?

368
00:48:55,079 --> 00:48:56,956
Were they militia?
Were they Regulars?

369
00:48:57,498 --> 00:48:59,667
I don't really remember how many.

370
00:49:02,253 --> 00:49:03,338
Maybe one.

371
00:49:05,590 --> 00:49:08,009
One man. Really?

372
00:49:08,384 --> 00:49:10,094
He was in the flank.

373
00:49:11,596 --> 00:49:13,222
All around us.

374
00:49:13,598 --> 00:49:15,099
Amongst us.

375
00:49:15,683 --> 00:49:18,311
I could barely see him.
He was there, then he was gone.

376
00:49:18,436 --> 00:49:20,104
He just vanished.

377
00:49:21,314 --> 00:49:23,650
Sounds more like a ghost than a man.

378
00:49:24,067 --> 00:49:25,610
A ghost.

379
00:49:27,070 --> 00:49:28,780
He was like a ghost.

380
00:49:30,365 --> 00:49:31,699
Enough.

381
00:49:33,826 --> 00:49:36,537
Bordon? Take a patrol.

382
00:49:36,746 --> 00:49:39,707
Capture this ghost before
word of his exploits spread.

383
00:49:39,916 --> 00:49:42,835
- Who's this?
- Sir, this is Captain Wilkins.

384
00:49:43,044 --> 00:49:46,547
He was with the Loyalist Colonial
Militia. He might be of use.

385
00:49:47,048 --> 00:49:48,674
Another colonial.

386
00:49:49,342 --> 00:49:51,803
Captain Wilkins,
where do your loyalties lie?

387
00:49:52,095 --> 00:49:53,179
To king and country.

388
00:49:53,513 --> 00:49:55,973
Why should I trust a man who'd
betray his neighbors?

389
00:49:56,808 --> 00:49:59,811
Those neighbors of mine who stand
against England...

390
00:50:00,061 --> 00:50:01,771
...deserve to die a traitor's death.

391
00:50:02,939 --> 00:50:03,940
We'll see.

392
00:50:10,279 --> 00:50:11,614
Mr. Martin!

393
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:19,705
Miss Charlotte!

394
00:50:31,342 --> 00:50:34,137
You're safe now. Try to sleep.

395
00:50:34,345 --> 00:50:35,596
Good night.

396
00:50:35,972 --> 00:50:37,056
Good night.

397
00:50:37,682 --> 00:50:39,016
Father?

398
00:50:39,267 --> 00:50:40,518
Yes.

399
00:50:41,477 --> 00:50:43,604
I killed those men.

400
00:50:44,856 --> 00:50:46,315
You did what I told you to do.

401
00:50:47,775 --> 00:50:50,862
You did what you had to.
There was no wrong in it.

402
00:50:53,322 --> 00:50:55,408
I'm glad I killed them.

403
00:50:59,078 --> 00:51:00,621
I'm glad.

404
00:51:10,464 --> 00:51:11,966
Get some rest.

405
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:20,975
Samuel.

406
00:51:41,704 --> 00:51:45,041
You've done nothing for which
you should be ashamed.

407
00:51:46,918 --> 00:51:48,502
I've done nothing.

408
00:51:50,296 --> 00:51:52,340
And for that, I am ashamed.

409
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:34,048
We'll go to Saint Helena.

410
00:52:34,465 --> 00:52:38,636
That's a free slave island
just north of Charles Town.

411
00:52:39,679 --> 00:52:41,263
Right under the British noses.

412
00:52:41,430 --> 00:52:44,767
- They won't think of look...
- I'm joining up with them.

413
00:52:45,434 --> 00:52:46,977
Gabriel.

414
00:52:49,063 --> 00:52:51,107
No. Your place is here now.

415
00:52:51,148 --> 00:52:53,442
I'm going back.
I'm a soldier, it's my duty.

416
00:52:54,276 --> 00:52:56,362
Your duty is to your family.

417
00:52:58,114 --> 00:52:59,990
Don't you walk away from me, boy!

418
00:53:00,157 --> 00:53:01,534
I'll find you when it's over.

419
00:53:01,575 --> 00:53:03,536
No, I forbid you to go!

420
00:53:03,661 --> 00:53:06,205
- I'm not a child!
- You're my child!

421
00:53:08,874 --> 00:53:10,334
Goodbye, Father.

422
00:53:11,502 --> 00:53:13,295
Gabriel.

423
00:53:13,963 --> 00:53:15,589
Thomas is dead.

424
00:53:16,173 --> 00:53:19,009
How many more have to die
before you'll heed my word?

425
00:53:49,081 --> 00:53:51,041
I'm losing my family.

426
00:53:54,753 --> 00:53:56,839
When will you be back, Father?

427
00:53:57,882 --> 00:53:59,258
I don't know.

428
00:53:59,717 --> 00:54:01,010
Tomorrow?

429
00:54:01,427 --> 00:54:03,095
No, not tomorrow.

430
00:54:03,721 --> 00:54:05,431
You say your prayers.

431
00:54:05,681 --> 00:54:06,849
I will.

432
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:11,187
Take care of your brothers and sisters
and your Aunt Charlotte.

433
00:54:11,437 --> 00:54:13,314
I'm depending on you.

434
00:54:14,315 --> 00:54:16,192
As I am on you, Samuel.

435
00:54:17,693 --> 00:54:18,736
All right.

436
00:54:25,701 --> 00:54:26,952
Susan...

437
00:54:29,163 --> 00:54:30,456
...goodbye.

438
00:54:45,387 --> 00:54:46,639
Thank you.

439
00:56:54,725 --> 00:56:56,143
Halt!

440
00:57:00,355 --> 00:57:01,982
Make ready!

441
00:57:06,862 --> 00:57:08,447
Take aim!

442
00:57:12,868 --> 00:57:14,244
Fire!

443
00:57:26,298 --> 00:57:28,008
I'm not going back.

444
00:57:28,717 --> 00:57:30,928
No, I didn't expect you would.

445
00:57:35,515 --> 00:57:37,809
That Gates is a damn fool.

446
00:57:39,770 --> 00:57:42,064
He spent too many years
in the British army.

447
00:57:42,397 --> 00:57:46,443
Going muzzle-to-muzzle with Redcoats
in open field. It's madness.

448
00:57:47,152 --> 00:57:48,237
Halt!

449
00:57:48,695 --> 00:57:50,405
Make ready!

450
00:57:51,073 --> 00:57:52,866
Present!

451
00:57:53,909 --> 00:57:55,160
Fire!

452
00:58:17,933 --> 00:58:20,560
This battle was over before it began.

453
00:58:30,237 --> 00:58:31,488
Retreat!

454
00:58:32,114 --> 00:58:33,949
Retreat!

455
00:58:41,039 --> 00:58:43,583
These rustics are so inept.

456
00:58:44,001 --> 00:58:46,461
Nearly takes the honor
out of victory.

457
00:58:47,379 --> 00:58:48,547
Nearly.

458
00:59:10,277 --> 00:59:12,320
Hello general, gentlemen.

459
00:59:12,529 --> 00:59:15,282
A glorious day
for His Majesty and England.

460
00:59:15,449 --> 00:59:17,576
Colonel Tavington.

461
00:59:17,826 --> 00:59:20,704
Always too early.

462
00:59:20,954 --> 00:59:22,456
Always too eager for glory.

463
00:59:23,790 --> 00:59:26,543
For victory, my lord.

464
00:59:27,127 --> 00:59:29,004
I believe we took the field.

465
00:59:29,171 --> 00:59:31,798
Next time, you'll wait
for my command.

466
00:59:32,382 --> 00:59:36,762
It appears that Colonel Tavington
prefers to follow his own commands.

467
00:59:37,012 --> 00:59:38,346
General O'Hara tells me...

468
00:59:38,513 --> 00:59:42,350
...you've earned the nickname
"The Butcher" among the populous.

469
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:44,519
We'll discuss it tomorrow.

470
00:59:44,895 --> 00:59:47,522
Gentlemen, my compliments.

471
00:59:47,689 --> 00:59:50,150
- To a victory.
- Hear, hear.

472
01:00:00,410 --> 01:00:01,495
Hold him firm.

473
01:00:19,721 --> 01:00:22,641
- Where's your commanding officer?
- That tent there.

474
01:00:29,397 --> 01:00:31,191
It's a lost cause.

475
01:00:47,999 --> 01:00:49,542
Benjamin Martin.

476
01:00:49,751 --> 01:00:51,711
I'm in no mood for a lecture.

477
01:00:52,087 --> 01:00:54,381
Where's your General Gates now?

478
01:00:54,756 --> 01:00:58,885
The last anyone saw,
riding hard northeast...

479
01:00:59,135 --> 01:01:02,055
...his staff 100 yards behind,
trying to catch up.

480
01:01:02,931 --> 01:01:04,641
So who's in command?

481
01:01:05,225 --> 01:01:06,434
I am.

482
01:01:07,477 --> 01:01:08,937
I think.

483
01:01:10,105 --> 01:01:11,481
What are my orders?

484
01:01:16,403 --> 01:01:19,572
We're a breath away from losing
this war, Benjamin.

485
01:01:22,409 --> 01:01:25,412
In the north, Washington is
reeling from Morristown.

486
01:01:25,662 --> 01:01:28,331
He's running and hiding
from 12,000 Redcoats.

487
01:01:28,581 --> 01:01:31,126
In the south, Cornwallis has
broken our back.

488
01:01:31,334 --> 01:01:34,587
Captured over 5000 of our troops
when he took Charles Town.

489
01:01:34,838 --> 01:01:37,924
And he destroyed the only army
between him and New York.

490
01:01:39,676 --> 01:01:42,929
Nothing will stop him from
heading north to finish off Washington.

491
01:01:43,346 --> 01:01:47,100
Unless we can keep Cornwallis
in the south till the French arrive.

492
01:01:48,351 --> 01:01:51,229
They've promised a fleet
and 10,000 troops.

493
01:01:51,479 --> 01:01:53,106
When?

494
01:01:54,149 --> 01:01:56,484
Six months at the earliest.

495
01:01:56,818 --> 01:01:59,112
You trust the French
to keep their word?

496
01:01:59,362 --> 01:02:00,655
<i>Absolument.</i>

497
01:02:03,033 --> 01:02:05,702
Benjamin Martin.
Major Jean Villeneuve.

498
01:02:05,869 --> 01:02:08,621
French Seventh Light Foot.
He will help train the militia.

499
01:02:09,539 --> 01:02:12,792
The hero of Fort Wilderness.
Your reputation precedes you.

500
01:02:17,714 --> 01:02:20,800
You really expect to hold Cornwallis
here using just militia?

501
01:02:21,092 --> 01:02:23,303
Not me. You.

502
01:02:25,638 --> 01:02:27,515
They're not soldiers, they're farmers.

503
01:02:27,724 --> 01:02:30,393
They'd be better off letting
the British march through.

504
01:02:30,602 --> 01:02:33,313
They'd be better off,
but the cause wouldn't.

505
01:02:34,355 --> 01:02:36,399
How many men
does Cornwallis have?

506
01:02:36,775 --> 01:02:38,818
8000 infantry.

507
01:02:39,068 --> 01:02:41,321
Around 600 cavalry.

508
01:02:41,696 --> 01:02:44,240
I'm giving you a field commission
as a colonel.

509
01:02:44,699 --> 01:02:47,535
Might I request that you transfer
my son under my command?

510
01:02:47,577 --> 01:02:49,078
Sir, no, I...

511
01:02:49,287 --> 01:02:50,622
That's done.

512
01:02:54,125 --> 01:02:55,210
Thank you.

513
01:02:57,212 --> 01:02:59,047
Colonel, I've been a soldier
for two years.

514
01:02:59,422 --> 01:03:01,883
As a scout, horseman,
marksman, scavenger.

515
01:03:02,091 --> 01:03:04,636
- Is that so?
- I'd be of better use with Regulars.

516
01:03:04,844 --> 01:03:06,971
Where'd you learn all that
riding, shooting, scavenging?

517
01:03:07,180 --> 01:03:08,807
My father taught me.

518
01:03:10,850 --> 01:03:12,435
Teach you any humility?

519
01:03:13,102 --> 01:03:14,687
He tried. It didn't take.

520
01:03:16,189 --> 01:03:19,776
He also taught you every trail
between here and Charles Town...

521
01:03:19,901 --> 01:03:21,736
...which is why he transferred you.

522
01:03:22,445 --> 01:03:25,073
We'll put the word out.
Start on the south side of...

523
01:03:25,323 --> 01:03:27,534
We'll cover more ground
if we split up.

524
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:34,499
Very well, corporal. You take
Harrisville, Pembroke, Wakefield.

525
01:03:34,874 --> 01:03:39,045
I'll start on the north side.
Meet at the mission in Black Swamp.

526
01:03:43,049 --> 01:03:44,133
Corporal.

527
01:03:45,885 --> 01:03:47,387
Be careful.

528
01:03:49,681 --> 01:03:50,848
Yes, sir.

529
01:03:55,812 --> 01:03:57,313
You have children?

530
01:04:02,026 --> 01:04:03,403
French.

531
01:04:27,510 --> 01:04:29,304
It skirts the mountain and then...

532
01:04:29,554 --> 01:04:31,848
...extends down towards
the headwater here...

533
01:04:32,140 --> 01:04:35,643
...and right across to the far bank
of the Ohio River.

534
01:04:36,019 --> 01:04:37,312
It's 100,000 acres.

535
01:04:37,562 --> 01:04:39,856
It's an imposing land grant, my lord.

536
01:04:40,064 --> 01:04:42,734
You will be a country unto yourself.

537
01:04:46,446 --> 01:04:48,156
His Majesty is most generous.

538
01:04:50,950 --> 01:04:54,787
Though your service in this war
more than warrants such a gift.

539
01:04:55,747 --> 01:05:00,460
Yes, this is how His Majesty
rewards those...

540
01:05:00,710 --> 01:05:02,754
...who fight for him as gentlemen.

541
01:05:03,046 --> 01:05:07,091
I dare to presume my own meager
contributions will be rewarded one day.

542
01:05:07,300 --> 01:05:09,343
You may presume too much.

543
01:05:10,053 --> 01:05:13,556
His Majesty, like history,
judges us by the outcome of the war...

544
01:05:13,848 --> 01:05:15,892
...and the manner in which
it was fought.

545
01:05:16,976 --> 01:05:19,812
We serve the Crown, and we must
conduct ourselves accordingly.

546
01:05:20,855 --> 01:05:22,857
Surrendering troops
will be given quarter.

547
01:05:23,274 --> 01:05:25,401
These brutal tactics must stop!

548
01:05:26,069 --> 01:05:28,488
Is it not enough that I have
never lost a battle?

549
01:05:28,738 --> 01:05:29,906
You serve me...

550
01:05:30,114 --> 01:05:34,410
...and the manner in which
you serve me reflects upon me!

551
01:05:35,453 --> 01:05:39,082
I would've thought that a gentleman
from a family as esteemed as yours...

552
01:05:39,290 --> 01:05:40,666
...would understand that.

553
01:05:42,668 --> 01:05:45,588
My late father squandered any esteem
in which we were held...

554
01:05:45,797 --> 01:05:47,673
...along with my inheritance.

555
01:05:51,093 --> 01:05:53,763
I advance myself
only through victory.

556
01:05:53,971 --> 01:05:57,308
You advance yourself
only through my good graces.

557
01:05:59,018 --> 01:06:01,062
These Colonials are our brethren.

558
01:06:01,312 --> 01:06:06,108
And when this conflict is over, we
will re-establish commerce with them.

559
01:06:06,609 --> 01:06:08,486
Do you understand, colonel?

560
01:06:09,821 --> 01:06:11,531
Perfectly, my lord.

561
01:06:54,448 --> 01:06:57,535
Reverend, with your permission,
I'd like to make an announcement.

562
01:06:57,827 --> 01:07:00,871
Young man, this is a house of God.

563
01:07:01,497 --> 01:07:04,083
I understand that, reverend.
I apologize.

564
01:07:05,876 --> 01:07:08,963
The South Carolina Militia is
being called up.

565
01:07:09,297 --> 01:07:11,215
I'm here to enlist every man willing.

566
01:07:12,633 --> 01:07:13,467
Son...

567
01:07:14,176 --> 01:07:15,970
...we are here to pray...

568
01:07:16,220 --> 01:07:19,056
...for the souls of those men
hanging outside.

569
01:07:19,265 --> 01:07:21,142
Yes, pray for them.

570
01:07:21,392 --> 01:07:23,686
But honor them by
taking up arms with us.

571
01:07:25,521 --> 01:07:27,565
And bring more suffering
to this town?

572
01:07:27,940 --> 01:07:31,611
If King George can hang those men,
he can hang any one of us.

573
01:07:33,654 --> 01:07:34,822
Dan Scott...

574
01:07:35,031 --> 01:07:38,492
...barely a week ago you railed
for two hours about independence.

575
01:07:41,329 --> 01:07:43,706
Mr. Hardwick, how many times
have I heard you...

576
01:07:44,123 --> 01:07:46,667
...speak of freedom
at my father's table?

577
01:07:48,210 --> 01:07:51,547
Half the men in this church,
including you, Father...

578
01:07:52,798 --> 01:07:54,592
...and you, reverend...

579
01:07:55,051 --> 01:07:58,012
...are as ardent patriots as I.

580
01:08:02,683 --> 01:08:07,146
Will you now, when you are needed
most, stop at only words?

581
01:08:07,646 --> 01:08:09,440
Is that the sort of men you are?

582
01:08:19,075 --> 01:08:21,243
I ask only that you act
upon the beliefs...

583
01:08:21,577 --> 01:08:24,371
...of which you have
so strongly spoken...

584
01:08:25,331 --> 01:08:28,417
...and in which you
so strongly believe.

585
01:08:40,638 --> 01:08:42,056
Who's with us?

586
01:09:43,909 --> 01:09:44,910
Mr. Howard.

587
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:47,121
Sir...

588
01:09:47,621 --> 01:09:49,832
...may I have permission to
write to Anne?

589
01:09:53,669 --> 01:09:56,839
- May I have permission to write Anne?
- Yes.

590
01:09:57,840 --> 01:09:59,258
You have permission...

591
01:09:59,717 --> 01:10:01,677
...to write me.

592
01:10:02,136 --> 01:10:04,013
Oh, write her.

593
01:10:05,514 --> 01:10:06,849
Very well.

594
01:10:08,892 --> 01:10:10,060
Thank you, sir.

595
01:10:12,605 --> 01:10:13,856
Reverend?

596
01:10:20,738 --> 01:10:22,865
A shepherd must tend his flock.

597
01:10:24,158 --> 01:10:27,411
And, at times, fight off the wolves.

598
01:11:06,283 --> 01:11:09,536
Are you sure this is the right place
to recruit for a militia?

599
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:18,504
God save King George!

600
01:11:38,273 --> 01:11:40,234
I think we came to the right place.

601
01:11:46,949 --> 01:11:49,743
- Any bounty?
- No scalp money this time, Rollins.

602
01:11:49,993 --> 01:11:54,248
But you can keep or sell me the muskets
and gear of any Redcoat you kill.

603
01:12:06,301 --> 01:12:08,846
They hanged my brother
down in Acworth.

604
01:12:09,596 --> 01:12:12,266
Every damned one of them Redcoats
deserves to die.

605
01:12:12,516 --> 01:12:14,101
- Sign up.
- With all my ailments...

606
01:12:14,309 --> 01:12:17,312
...I wouldn't make it through
the first skirmish. No, sir.

607
01:12:17,521 --> 01:12:20,440
But you can have my Negro.
He'll fight in my stead.

608
01:12:20,649 --> 01:12:22,109
Occam! Get over here.

609
01:12:23,610 --> 01:12:27,114
Ain't overly smart.
He's strong as a bull.

610
01:12:27,322 --> 01:12:28,365
Can you write?

611
01:12:29,408 --> 01:12:31,243
No, no, sir.

612
01:12:31,493 --> 01:12:33,203
- Well, then, make your mark.
- Why?

613
01:12:33,579 --> 01:12:35,372
I just signed him over to you.

614
01:12:35,622 --> 01:12:37,749
If you're willing, make your mark.

615
01:12:44,590 --> 01:12:45,591
That'll do.

616
01:12:51,138 --> 01:12:52,681
I'll kill me some Redcoats.

617
01:12:53,599 --> 01:12:54,933
I believe you would.

618
01:12:55,309 --> 01:12:56,476
How old are you?

619
01:12:56,727 --> 01:12:59,271
Not quite old enough.
But his time will come.

620
01:12:59,521 --> 01:13:01,982
John Billings.
I was hoping you'd turn up.

621
01:13:02,232 --> 01:13:04,693
There's a story going around
about 20 Redcoats...

622
01:13:04,860 --> 01:13:07,613
...got killed by a ghost
or some damn thing.

623
01:13:07,821 --> 01:13:09,448
Carried a Cherokee tomahawk.

624
01:13:11,575 --> 01:13:14,578
Aren't you a little old to be
believing in ghost stories?

625
01:14:20,811 --> 01:14:22,437
How many did you get?

626
01:14:22,938 --> 01:14:23,939
Twelve.

627
01:14:24,731 --> 01:14:25,732
Good.

628
01:14:26,817 --> 01:14:29,653
These men,
they're not the sort we need.

629
01:14:32,948 --> 01:14:35,075
They're exactly the sort we need.

630
01:14:36,284 --> 01:14:38,412
They've fought
this kind of war before.

631
01:14:42,124 --> 01:14:43,917
What about me?
Am I one of that sort?

632
01:14:44,626 --> 01:14:45,877
Hell, no.

633
01:14:46,420 --> 01:14:48,463
Your sort gives that sort a bad name.

634
01:14:54,219 --> 01:14:57,472
I want accuracy and precision.

635
01:14:57,973 --> 01:14:59,141
Make ready!

636
01:15:03,979 --> 01:15:05,439
Take aim!

637
01:15:10,610 --> 01:15:11,945
Fire!

638
01:15:51,443 --> 01:15:52,694
<i>Dear Anne:</i>

639
01:15:52,986 --> 01:15:55,030
<i>Our force continues to grow.</i>

640
01:15:55,238 --> 01:15:59,701
<i>As long as we continue to fight,
others will come to fight beside us.</i>

641
01:15:59,910 --> 01:16:02,913
<i>I long to see you and speak to you.</i>

642
01:16:03,163 --> 01:16:05,707
<i>I'm hopeful that our duties
will bring me near you.</i>

643
01:16:05,957 --> 01:16:10,253
<i>Until then, I am and will remain
most affectionately yours.</i>

644
01:16:10,462 --> 01:16:11,463
<i>Gabriel.</i>

645
01:16:37,906 --> 01:16:39,449
We surrender!

646
01:16:41,660 --> 01:16:43,036
No! God, stop!

647
01:16:43,244 --> 01:16:44,704
For the love of God, we...

648
01:16:45,914 --> 01:16:47,540
These men were about to surrender!

649
01:16:49,584 --> 01:16:50,919
Perhaps.

650
01:16:51,127 --> 01:16:52,170
We will never know.

651
01:16:52,671 --> 01:16:53,672
This is murder!

652
01:16:54,255 --> 01:16:57,384
Hell, reverend, they're Redcoats.
They've earned it.

653
01:17:00,136 --> 01:17:02,597
- We're better than that.
- What do you know about war?

654
01:17:02,806 --> 01:17:04,683
I know the difference
between fighting...

655
01:17:04,933 --> 01:17:06,559
Go back to church!

656
01:17:06,768 --> 01:17:08,061
Quiet!

657
01:17:09,896 --> 01:17:11,231
He's right.

658
01:17:11,981 --> 01:17:15,568
Quarter will be given to British
wounded and any who surrender.

659
01:17:15,777 --> 01:17:19,531
They gave no quarter when they fired on
a ship carrying my wife and daughters.

660
01:17:20,573 --> 01:17:23,910
I watched from 200 yards off
as they were burned alive.

661
01:17:24,494 --> 01:17:27,497
- All my sympathy, but my order stands.
- Damn your sympathy.

662
01:17:28,289 --> 01:17:30,500
Who are you to give such an order?

663
01:17:31,376 --> 01:17:34,462
I know what you did
to my countrymen at Fort Wilderness.

664
01:17:37,006 --> 01:17:40,427
We're militia.
This is not regular army.

665
01:17:41,511 --> 01:17:43,972
Every man here is free to
come and go as he pleases.

666
01:17:44,222 --> 01:17:45,348
But while you're here...

667
01:17:45,723 --> 01:17:48,184
...you will obey my command
or I will have you shot.

668
01:17:54,107 --> 01:17:56,151
- Damn dogs!
- Shoot the damn things!

669
01:17:56,401 --> 01:17:59,487
- Stay that pistol.
- They won't let you near the wagon.

670
01:18:05,535 --> 01:18:07,912
- Rum, Madeira.
- No wonder they were guarding it.

671
01:18:08,079 --> 01:18:09,330
Officers' uniforms.

672
01:18:09,581 --> 01:18:11,416
What you think all this is worth?

673
01:18:12,917 --> 01:18:16,254
It's the personal correspondence
of Lord Cornwallis.

674
01:18:18,590 --> 01:18:19,591
This is his journal.

675
01:18:21,092 --> 01:18:24,971
I say we drink the wine, eat the dogs
and use the papers for musket wadding.

676
01:18:25,430 --> 01:18:26,764
Eat the dogs?

677
01:18:27,932 --> 01:18:29,726
Dog is a fine meal.

678
01:18:30,894 --> 01:18:32,270
Good heavens.

679
01:18:45,450 --> 01:18:47,410
I have some maps here for you.

680
01:18:48,786 --> 01:18:51,331
Put them down over there.
Thank you.

681
01:18:52,582 --> 01:18:54,876
Here. A proper musket for you.

682
01:18:55,126 --> 01:18:59,297
I don't know about you, but I don't like
the idea giving muskets to slaves.

683
01:19:01,966 --> 01:19:04,260
Your sense of freedom is
as pale as your skin.

684
01:19:11,059 --> 01:19:12,769
Don't listen to them.

685
01:19:14,896 --> 01:19:17,440
If we win this war,
a lot of things will change.

686
01:19:18,358 --> 01:19:19,901
What will change?

687
01:19:21,277 --> 01:19:25,949
They call this the New World.
It's not. It's the same as the old.

688
01:19:28,576 --> 01:19:31,120
But we'll have a chance
to build a new world.

689
01:19:34,248 --> 01:19:38,711
A world where all men are
created equal under God.

690
01:19:39,504 --> 01:19:40,755
Equal.

691
01:19:42,131 --> 01:19:43,800
Sounds good.

692
01:19:44,968 --> 01:19:47,345
I've just been in the mind
of a genius.

693
01:19:50,098 --> 01:19:54,644
Cornwallis knows more about warfare
than we could learn in a dozen lifetimes.

694
01:19:55,228 --> 01:19:56,562
That's cheerful news.

695
01:19:57,021 --> 01:20:01,317
His victories at Camden and
Charles Town were perfect. Perfect.

696
01:20:02,276 --> 01:20:04,237
And he knows it, what's more.

697
01:20:06,614 --> 01:20:07,991
Perhaps that's his weakness.

698
01:20:08,491 --> 01:20:09,659
Sir?

699
01:20:10,952 --> 01:20:12,120
Pride.

700
01:20:13,329 --> 01:20:14,747
Pride's a weakness.

701
01:20:15,289 --> 01:20:17,834
Personally, I would prefer stupidity.

702
01:20:20,128 --> 01:20:21,462
Pride will do.

703
01:20:32,682 --> 01:20:34,475
Finished, my lord.

704
01:20:34,976 --> 01:20:36,936
I've taken it in at the back...

705
01:20:37,186 --> 01:20:39,897
...added wider epaulets
and looped gold braiding.

706
01:20:40,106 --> 01:20:42,900
- It's a horse blanket.
- I don't know, my lord.

707
01:20:43,401 --> 01:20:45,737
It's really quite nice.

708
01:20:46,070 --> 01:20:48,865
- Very nice, my lord.
- Very well. It's a nice horse blanket.

709
01:20:50,616 --> 01:20:53,536
Colonel Tavington,
why, after six weeks...

710
01:20:53,745 --> 01:20:56,831
...am I still attending a ball
in South Carolina...

711
01:20:57,081 --> 01:20:59,792
...when I should be attending balls
in North Carolina?

712
01:20:59,959 --> 01:21:01,377
First, the theft of my baggage...

713
01:21:01,794 --> 01:21:04,505
...including my memoirs,
on which I spent countless hours.

714
01:21:05,089 --> 01:21:08,593
Then half the bridges and ferries
between here and Charles Town burned.

715
01:21:09,093 --> 01:21:11,804
If you can't protect our supply lines
against militia...

716
01:21:12,180 --> 01:21:15,600
...how do you intend doing so against
the Regulars or the French?

717
01:21:15,808 --> 01:21:18,436
They won't fight like Regulars.
We can't find them.

718
01:21:18,644 --> 01:21:21,105
Colonel, they're militia.

719
01:21:21,772 --> 01:21:24,066
They're farmers with pitchforks!

720
01:21:24,901 --> 01:21:27,361
They're rather more than that,
I'm afraid.

721
01:21:27,653 --> 01:21:30,573
Made so by their commander,
this ghost.

722
01:21:30,823 --> 01:21:33,659
Oh, ghost, ghost, ghost.

723
01:21:34,243 --> 01:21:36,829
You created this ghost, colonel.

724
01:21:37,663 --> 01:21:39,457
Your brutality swelled his ranks.

725
01:21:39,707 --> 01:21:42,001
Without them this ghost
would've disappeared...

726
01:21:42,043 --> 01:21:44,587
...and I'd be
in North Carolina by now!

727
01:21:44,837 --> 01:21:46,088
In my defense, my lord...

728
01:21:46,214 --> 01:21:48,174
Oh, enough, enough!

729
01:21:48,883 --> 01:21:53,137
A fine soldier you are,
bested by a bedtime story.

730
01:21:54,472 --> 01:21:56,432
Give me the horse blanket.

731
01:21:59,644 --> 01:22:02,730
O'Hara, our supply ship appears
to have arrived.

732
01:22:03,356 --> 01:22:04,774
Yes, my lord, it has.

733
01:22:04,982 --> 01:22:07,443
Then why am I still wearing this rag?

734
01:22:07,652 --> 01:22:10,571
Your replacement wardrobe is
aboard ship, but...

735
01:22:10,780 --> 01:22:14,867
...Colonel Tavington thought it best to
secure our arms and munitions first.

736
01:22:15,034 --> 01:22:16,202
They are being unloaded.

737
01:22:27,922 --> 01:22:29,382
You look good in that color.

738
01:22:31,509 --> 01:22:32,760
It stinks.

739
01:22:34,762 --> 01:22:36,555
Well, it's had a dead man in it.

740
01:22:36,931 --> 01:22:38,724
The beasts took your dogs too?

741
01:22:39,100 --> 01:22:40,351
Yes.

742
01:22:41,352 --> 01:22:44,522
Fine animals.
A gift from His Majesty.

743
01:22:45,439 --> 01:22:46,983
Dead now, for all I know.

744
01:22:47,441 --> 01:22:49,652
Is there no decency?

745
01:22:58,911 --> 01:23:02,665
Oh, fireworks. Lovely!

746
01:23:34,655 --> 01:23:36,198
Mr. Howard.

747
01:23:37,158 --> 01:23:39,285
I've come to call on Anne.

748
01:23:45,082 --> 01:23:48,169
I've come to call on Anne!

749
01:23:48,419 --> 01:23:50,629
Well, of course you
call yourself a man.

750
01:23:51,630 --> 01:23:54,967
Father, stop it. You heard him.

751
01:23:57,511 --> 01:23:58,512
Well...

752
01:23:59,221 --> 01:24:00,723
...call on her.

753
01:24:26,499 --> 01:24:27,833
I'm nearly finished.

754
01:24:29,585 --> 01:24:31,378
You needn't worry, Father.

755
01:24:31,629 --> 01:24:33,047
Yeah, I know.

756
01:24:33,631 --> 01:24:37,468
Bundling bags are a wonderful
tradition. I don't mind in the least.

757
01:24:39,261 --> 01:24:40,804
Be still.

758
01:24:41,388 --> 01:24:42,431
Tea?

759
01:24:43,474 --> 01:24:44,808
Please.

760
01:24:46,602 --> 01:24:47,645
There.

761
01:24:56,195 --> 01:24:57,446
Come, dear.

762
01:25:08,999 --> 01:25:10,459
It's very good.

763
01:25:13,462 --> 01:25:15,673
I'm pleased that you like it.

764
01:25:24,515 --> 01:25:25,683
Peter.

765
01:25:26,433 --> 01:25:30,020
Don't worry. I sew better
than my mother did.

766
01:25:33,107 --> 01:25:34,566
I hope so.

767
01:25:40,823 --> 01:25:42,866
If you're just gonna stand there...

768
01:25:43,158 --> 01:25:44,868
...why don't you read it for us?

769
01:25:44,994 --> 01:25:46,704
I can't read.

770
01:25:49,498 --> 01:25:50,749
I can.

771
01:25:54,003 --> 01:25:55,004
"Take notice.

772
01:25:55,921 --> 01:25:59,425
By order of General Washington
and the Continental Congress...

773
01:25:59,591 --> 01:26:02,720
...all bound slaves who give
minimum one year service...

774
01:26:03,137 --> 01:26:04,638
...in the Continental Army...

775
01:26:05,472 --> 01:26:07,516
...will be granted freedom...

776
01:26:08,183 --> 01:26:11,937
...and be paid a bounty of five
shillings for each month of service. "

777
01:26:12,438 --> 01:26:13,814
Did you hear that?

778
01:26:14,023 --> 01:26:16,275
First they'll free them,
then they'll pay them.

779
01:26:17,609 --> 01:26:19,820
Only another six months.

780
01:26:22,489 --> 01:26:24,283
What will you do with freedom?

781
01:26:35,711 --> 01:26:37,337
I made this for you.

782
01:26:53,729 --> 01:26:55,522
Look after your mother.

783
01:27:01,028 --> 01:27:02,529
You know, Peter...

784
01:27:03,197 --> 01:27:04,823
...I can't pay you for this.

785
01:27:05,032 --> 01:27:09,203
Benjamin, you pay me what you can,
when you can.

786
01:27:09,661 --> 01:27:11,079
I'm obliged.

787
01:27:12,414 --> 01:27:15,709
Gabriel sure reminds me a lot of you.

788
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:19,171
No, no, he's more like his mother.

789
01:27:20,923 --> 01:27:22,174
Corporal!

790
01:27:23,717 --> 01:27:25,594
Take your time. Dogs.

791
01:27:42,820 --> 01:27:43,862
Sir.

792
01:28:30,284 --> 01:28:32,160
This road is closed.

793
01:28:32,578 --> 01:28:34,871
These wagons now belong to
the Continental Army.

794
01:28:35,330 --> 01:28:37,791
Ready arms!

795
01:28:50,595 --> 01:28:52,014
By twos!

796
01:29:01,023 --> 01:29:04,651
There's no need for your men to die.
Leave the wagons and go.

797
01:29:05,193 --> 01:29:06,903
This is the king's highway.

798
01:29:07,279 --> 01:29:10,032
And I advise you and your men
to make way.

799
01:29:16,955 --> 01:29:18,040
Charge!

800
01:29:19,082 --> 01:29:20,167
Fire!

801
01:29:21,501 --> 01:29:22,878
Retreat!

802
01:29:29,885 --> 01:29:31,261
Save yourselves!

803
01:29:59,414 --> 01:30:00,457
Retreat!

804
01:30:19,059 --> 01:30:21,311
Ambush! Ambush!

805
01:30:55,011 --> 01:30:56,638
I have the count.

806
01:30:58,098 --> 01:30:59,891
22 are dead.

807
01:31:00,642 --> 01:31:03,019
18 wounded and 20 are missing.

808
01:31:03,311 --> 01:31:04,646
I'm through.

809
01:31:10,652 --> 01:31:12,279
He won't be the last to leave.

810
01:31:12,988 --> 01:31:15,198
Trust me.
Soon my countrymen will arrive.

811
01:31:15,448 --> 01:31:17,409
- The French army is...
- To hell with you.

812
01:31:17,617 --> 01:31:19,202
And to hell with the French army.

813
01:31:19,411 --> 01:31:20,495
We don't need them.

814
01:31:20,745 --> 01:31:23,873
We got Benjamin Martin.
We know what he done to the French.

815
01:31:38,471 --> 01:31:39,848
Father.

816
01:31:40,390 --> 01:31:44,728
Men always buy you drinks because
of what happened at Fort Wilderness.

817
01:31:47,230 --> 01:31:49,858
Strangers know more
about you than I do.

818
01:31:51,943 --> 01:31:53,570
Tell me what happened.

819
01:31:54,738 --> 01:31:59,326
Your mother asked me that question
around about the time you were born.

820
01:32:02,162 --> 01:32:04,873
I was drunk and foolish enough
to answer it.

821
01:32:11,504 --> 01:32:14,966
The French and the Cherokee
had raided along the Blue Ridge.

822
01:32:15,717 --> 01:32:18,803
The English settlers had sought refuge
at Fort Charles.

823
01:32:19,137 --> 01:32:22,265
By the time we got there,
the fort was abandoned.

824
01:32:23,767 --> 01:32:25,894
They'd left about a week before.

825
01:32:27,354 --> 01:32:29,898
But what we found was...

826
01:32:32,692 --> 01:32:33,943
Go on.

827
01:32:37,072 --> 01:32:40,575
They'd killed all the settlers,
the men.

828
01:32:42,619 --> 01:32:44,412
With the women and...

829
01:32:44,621 --> 01:32:46,831
...some of the children, they had...

830
01:32:49,918 --> 01:32:52,879
We buried them all,
what was left of them.

831
01:32:55,548 --> 01:32:58,259
We caught up with them
at Fort Wilderness.

832
01:33:01,346 --> 01:33:02,931
We took our time.

833
01:33:05,266 --> 01:33:08,144
We cut them apart slowly.

834
01:33:08,937 --> 01:33:10,647
Piece by piece.

835
01:33:15,985 --> 01:33:17,946
I can see their faces.

836
01:33:21,241 --> 01:33:23,451
I can still hear their screams.

837
01:33:25,578 --> 01:33:28,915
All but two. We let them live.

838
01:33:30,291 --> 01:33:32,418
We sent the heads on a pallet...

839
01:33:32,627 --> 01:33:35,255
...with the two that lived
back to Fort Ambercon.

840
01:33:36,005 --> 01:33:39,259
The eyes, tongues, fingers...

841
01:33:39,425 --> 01:33:41,427
...we put in baskets.

842
01:33:41,845 --> 01:33:44,639
Sent them down the Asheulot
to the Cherokee.

843
01:33:46,724 --> 01:33:50,270
Soon after, the Cherokee broke
their treaty with the French.

844
01:33:52,981 --> 01:33:55,066
That's how we justified it.

845
01:34:04,158 --> 01:34:05,493
We were...

846
01:34:07,161 --> 01:34:08,538
...heroes.

847
01:34:10,957 --> 01:34:13,084
And men bought you drinks.

848
01:34:17,839 --> 01:34:21,843
Not a day goes by where I don't ask
God's forgiveness for what I did.

849
01:34:30,018 --> 01:34:34,022
Thomas was my brother,
as well as your son.

850
01:34:34,355 --> 01:34:38,276
You may not believe this, but I want
satisfaction as much as you do.

851
01:34:40,320 --> 01:34:42,363
But not at the expense of our cause.

852
01:34:43,615 --> 01:34:46,159
There will be a time for revenge.

853
01:34:47,160 --> 01:34:49,621
But until then, stay the course.

854
01:34:51,748 --> 01:34:54,917
Your mother said that when
I'd get drunk or lose my temper.

855
01:34:55,168 --> 01:34:57,629
She'd say it to me
when I picked on Thomas.

856
01:35:03,676 --> 01:35:04,927
I miss him.

857
01:35:21,569 --> 01:35:24,655
The British got 18 of our men
at Fort Carolina.

858
01:35:25,114 --> 01:35:28,117
They'll be hung one at a time until
they give up the rest of us.

859
01:35:44,092 --> 01:35:45,343
Reverend...

860
01:35:45,593 --> 01:35:47,553
...can you write a letter for me?

861
01:35:48,096 --> 01:35:50,640
- To my wife and boy.
- Yes, of course I will.

862
01:35:50,807 --> 01:35:53,810
But first let us pray.

863
01:36:08,533 --> 01:36:09,575
<i>My lord...</i>

864
01:36:09,951 --> 01:36:11,661
...there is a rider at the gates.

865
01:36:12,036 --> 01:36:14,789
A civilian carrying a white flag.

866
01:36:15,164 --> 01:36:16,749
I am occupied.

867
01:36:17,250 --> 01:36:19,627
He has a pair of dogs with him.

868
01:36:20,294 --> 01:36:22,672
Great Danes.

869
01:36:23,631 --> 01:36:24,632
<i>And dear Lord...</i>

870
01:36:24,841 --> 01:36:27,135
...protect us in this,
our hour of need.

871
01:36:27,301 --> 01:36:31,055
This we ask in the name
of the Father, the Son...

872
01:36:31,264 --> 01:36:32,974
And the Holy Ghost.

873
01:36:38,146 --> 01:36:39,313
<i>Wait here.</i>

874
01:36:39,647 --> 01:36:41,899
General Lord Cornwallis will be
with you shortly.

875
01:37:25,484 --> 01:37:28,362
Jupiter, Mars. Come, boys.

876
01:37:31,282 --> 01:37:32,283
Come.

877
01:37:35,786 --> 01:37:39,707
My good boys. My brave boys.
You seem to be well fed.

878
01:37:41,584 --> 01:37:43,169
I thank you for that.

879
01:37:43,377 --> 01:37:45,922
I'm afraid I don't know your name.

880
01:37:46,172 --> 01:37:50,384
I'm a colonel in the Continental Army.
My rank should be sufficient for now.

881
01:37:51,260 --> 01:37:52,720
As you wish.

882
01:37:53,554 --> 01:37:54,722
Please be seated.

883
01:37:54,889 --> 01:37:55,931
Thank you.

884
01:37:58,017 --> 01:38:01,688
Would you, as the initiating officer,
care to begin?

885
01:38:02,313 --> 01:38:05,233
I will, unless you'd like to
claim aggrieved status.

886
01:38:05,442 --> 01:38:08,111
Yes, I would like to claim
aggrieved status.

887
01:38:08,319 --> 01:38:10,029
Very well, sir. Proceed.

888
01:38:10,363 --> 01:38:14,742
You have in your possession
belongings of mine including clothing...

889
01:38:15,034 --> 01:38:18,538
...furniture, personal effects
of a non-military nature...

890
01:38:19,247 --> 01:38:20,957
...which I'd like returned to me.

891
01:38:21,416 --> 01:38:24,169
Indeed. I will do so
as soon as possible.

892
01:38:25,753 --> 01:38:26,838
Thank you.

893
01:38:27,172 --> 01:38:30,341
Now we come to the matter
of the specific targeting...

894
01:38:30,467 --> 01:38:32,469
...of officers during engagements.

895
01:38:32,927 --> 01:38:36,097
You must know that in civilized
warfare, officers in the field...

896
01:38:36,306 --> 01:38:40,685
...must not be accorded inappropriate
levels of hostile attention.

897
01:38:41,686 --> 01:38:45,273
To your mind, what are appropriate
levels of hostile attention?

898
01:38:45,482 --> 01:38:47,776
Imagine the chaos that would follow...

899
01:38:48,026 --> 01:38:51,196
...from leaderless armies
having at each other.

900
01:38:51,654 --> 01:38:54,824
There must be gentlemen in command
to lead...

901
01:38:55,074 --> 01:38:58,411
...and, where necessary,
restrain their men.

902
01:38:59,412 --> 01:39:03,541
Restrain them from, say, targeting
civilians. Women, children and such.

903
01:39:06,878 --> 01:39:08,004
That's a separate issue.

904
01:39:08,296 --> 01:39:10,089
No. I consider them linked.

905
01:39:10,924 --> 01:39:13,635
And as long as your soldiers
attack civilians...

906
01:39:13,843 --> 01:39:16,930
...I will order the shooting
of officers at every engagement.

907
01:39:19,474 --> 01:39:21,935
And my men are excellent marksmen.

908
01:39:26,189 --> 01:39:27,190
Very well.

909
01:39:27,816 --> 01:39:30,777
- Now, let us move on to...
- Prisoner exchange.

910
01:39:31,945 --> 01:39:32,946
Sir?

911
01:39:33,780 --> 01:39:37,117
You have 18 of my men.
I want them back.

912
01:39:43,957 --> 01:39:48,586
I do have 18 criminals
under sentence of death...

913
01:39:48,878 --> 01:39:51,339
...but I hold no prisoners of war.

914
01:39:51,798 --> 01:39:54,884
If that's your position,
18 of your officers will have to die.

915
01:39:55,135 --> 01:39:57,011
Nineteen, if you hang me
with my men.

916
01:39:57,428 --> 01:39:58,429
My officers?

917
01:39:58,680 --> 01:39:59,681
Sir.

918
01:40:07,272 --> 01:40:10,233
Top of the ridge, to your left.
Below the tree line.

919
01:40:23,371 --> 01:40:24,539
Their names and ranks?

920
01:40:24,873 --> 01:40:28,793
They refused to give names. There are
9 lieutenants, 5 captains, 3 majors...

921
01:40:29,043 --> 01:40:30,837
...and one fat colonel
who called me...

922
01:40:32,797 --> 01:40:34,507
...a cheeky fellow.

923
01:40:34,966 --> 01:40:37,677
This is not the conduct
of a gentleman.

924
01:40:37,969 --> 01:40:40,805
If the conduct of your officers is
the measure of a gentleman...

925
01:40:41,222 --> 01:40:43,266
...I'll take that as a compliment.

926
01:40:45,310 --> 01:40:46,478
Get my men.

927
01:40:50,440 --> 01:40:53,193
- Arrange the exchange.
- My lord.

928
01:40:53,318 --> 01:40:54,611
Thank you, sir.

929
01:41:26,101 --> 01:41:27,727
Release the prisoners!

930
01:41:32,690 --> 01:41:34,818
- What is this?
- Prisoner exchange.

931
01:41:35,026 --> 01:41:36,611
He has 18 of our officers.

932
01:41:36,820 --> 01:41:38,696
Who is he? I recognize him.

933
01:41:39,197 --> 01:41:40,824
He's the commander of the militia.

934
01:41:42,325 --> 01:41:45,161
- Your ghost.
- Stay that sword, colonel!

935
01:41:45,453 --> 01:41:47,789
He rode in under a white flag
for formal parley.

936
01:41:48,123 --> 01:41:49,374
This is madness.

937
01:41:50,083 --> 01:41:52,210
If you harm him,
you condemn our officers.

938
01:41:53,795 --> 01:41:57,966
With respect, sir, he's killed as many
officers in the last two months.

939
01:41:58,299 --> 01:42:02,762
He has shown no aggression here.
Hence he cannot be touched.

940
01:42:03,096 --> 01:42:04,639
Has he not?

941
01:42:08,226 --> 01:42:09,227
You!

942
01:42:09,978 --> 01:42:12,939
So you're the ghost, are you?
I remember you!

943
01:42:13,148 --> 01:42:15,191
On that farm! That stupid little boy!

944
01:42:22,240 --> 01:42:23,616
Did he die?

945
01:42:27,745 --> 01:42:28,830
You know...

946
01:42:29,247 --> 01:42:31,916
...it's an ugly business,
doing one's duty.

947
01:42:32,125 --> 01:42:34,252
But just occasionally...

948
01:42:34,919 --> 01:42:36,546
...it's a real pleasure.

949
01:42:40,675 --> 01:42:43,511
Before this war is over,
I'm going to kill you.

950
01:42:46,973 --> 01:42:48,641
Why wait?

951
01:42:57,984 --> 01:42:59,152
Soon.

952
01:43:32,185 --> 01:43:33,353
Move out!

953
01:43:38,066 --> 01:43:41,528
But I still think it's imperative
to push north.

954
01:43:44,697 --> 01:43:46,991
One of our captured officers, my lord.

955
01:43:51,913 --> 01:43:55,166
<i>My reputation suffers
because of your incompetence!</i>

956
01:43:55,416 --> 01:43:58,336
That man insults me!

957
01:43:59,212 --> 01:44:02,882
Quite impressive for a farmer with
a pitchfork, wouldn't you say?

958
01:44:10,098 --> 01:44:12,809
I want you to find that man.

959
01:44:13,518 --> 01:44:15,562
I want you to capture him.

960
01:44:16,980 --> 01:44:19,190
The man has
the loyalty of the people.

961
01:44:19,691 --> 01:44:22,068
They protect him. Protect his family.

962
01:44:22,277 --> 01:44:23,903
Protect the families of his men.

963
01:44:25,321 --> 01:44:27,282
I can capture him for you.

964
01:44:28,867 --> 01:44:32,704
But to do so requires the use
of tactics that are somewhat...

965
01:44:33,997 --> 01:44:36,207
What was the word
your lordship used?

966
01:44:38,084 --> 01:44:39,586
"Brutal," I think.

967
01:44:48,428 --> 01:44:49,429
Go on.

968
01:44:58,605 --> 01:45:01,149
I am prepared to do
what is necessary.

969
01:45:01,483 --> 01:45:05,945
I alone will assume the full mantle
of responsibility for my actions...

970
01:45:06,154 --> 01:45:08,281
...free of the chain of command...

971
01:45:08,490 --> 01:45:10,700
...rendering you blameless.

972
01:45:11,367 --> 01:45:12,744
However...

973
01:45:12,952 --> 01:45:14,746
...if I do this...

974
01:45:14,954 --> 01:45:18,875
...you and I both know that I can
never return to England with honor.

975
01:45:22,170 --> 01:45:25,924
What, I wonder, is to become of me?

976
01:45:33,515 --> 01:45:36,476
When this war is over here
in the Colonies...

977
01:45:36,935 --> 01:45:38,728
...the new aristocracy...

978
01:45:40,814 --> 01:45:42,607
...will be landowners.

979
01:45:49,948 --> 01:45:52,575
Tell me about Ohio.

980
01:45:58,206 --> 01:45:59,374
Make way.

981
01:46:00,500 --> 01:46:01,751
As you were.

982
01:46:04,879 --> 01:46:08,967
Wilkins. A plantation seven miles
from Wakefield, on the Santee...

983
01:46:09,175 --> 01:46:11,344
...east of Black Swamp.
Who lived there?

984
01:46:13,430 --> 01:46:14,931
Benjamin Martin.

985
01:46:15,140 --> 01:46:16,850
He's the ghost.

986
01:46:17,600 --> 01:46:19,018
What do you know about him?

987
01:46:19,227 --> 01:46:22,814
Hell, everything.
I could tell you the size of his boot.

988
01:46:23,731 --> 01:46:27,569
Does he have family?
Where would he hide his children?

989
01:46:36,369 --> 01:46:39,038
His wife's sister has a plantation.

990
01:46:39,497 --> 01:46:41,124
It's not far.

991
01:47:14,908 --> 01:47:18,077
Aunt Charlotte!
Wake up, someone's coming!

992
01:47:23,625 --> 01:47:25,251
Get the boys.

993
01:47:27,712 --> 01:47:30,340
Margaret, come quickly.

994
01:47:30,548 --> 01:47:33,343
- Let's go.
- Boys, come.

995
01:47:33,927 --> 01:47:34,761
Go.

996
01:47:39,599 --> 01:47:41,309
Stay close.

997
01:47:47,107 --> 01:47:48,525
This way.

998
01:48:04,999 --> 01:48:06,251
Follow me.

999
01:48:09,671 --> 01:48:12,215
We'll go downstairs to the kitchen.

1000
01:48:18,346 --> 01:48:20,640
Margaret, quick!
Get down there! Fast!

1001
01:48:32,527 --> 01:48:34,571
Samuel, get down there fast!

1002
01:49:31,920 --> 01:49:33,880
Beneath the sill. There.

1003
01:49:36,466 --> 01:49:38,009
There's no one in the house.

1004
01:49:38,218 --> 01:49:39,677
They can't be far.

1005
01:49:40,095 --> 01:49:42,472
Search the outbuildings
and the woods, quickly.

1006
01:50:20,218 --> 01:50:22,095
Prepare to fire the house.

1007
01:50:22,887 --> 01:50:24,264
Go.

1008
01:50:43,992 --> 01:50:45,952
This one's head of the house slaves.

1009
01:50:51,166 --> 01:50:52,750
Where are they hiding?

1010
01:50:56,588 --> 01:50:58,965
Keep looking!
They're here somewhere!

1011
01:51:04,804 --> 01:51:06,431
- Gabriel.
- Where's Father?

1012
01:51:06,765 --> 01:51:08,475
Torch the house!

1013
01:51:26,117 --> 01:51:27,118
To horse!

1014
01:51:34,501 --> 01:51:36,211
Come on! It's all right.

1015
01:51:36,419 --> 01:51:38,296
Susan, come here.

1016
01:51:47,514 --> 01:51:48,681
Charlotte!

1017
01:52:04,531 --> 01:52:07,408
They won't stop looking for us.

1018
01:52:09,702 --> 01:52:11,830
You'll be safe where we're taking you.

1019
01:52:12,705 --> 01:52:15,250
Father said it was
a perfect place to hide.

1020
01:52:17,877 --> 01:52:19,379
How is he?

1021
01:52:24,634 --> 01:52:26,386
I don't know. I'm his son.

1022
01:52:26,678 --> 01:52:28,555
Where is Father?

1023
01:52:30,098 --> 01:52:31,683
Speaking for months now.

1024
01:52:31,891 --> 01:52:33,476
Speaking for months.

1025
01:52:33,685 --> 01:52:35,478
Why did he go?

1026
01:52:37,689 --> 01:52:41,526
He didn't want those mean men
to find you, so he led them away.

1027
01:52:41,776 --> 01:52:44,154
He'll come see you
as soon as he can.

1028
01:52:44,446 --> 01:52:47,073
I don't care. I hate him.

1029
01:52:48,825 --> 01:52:50,535
Susan, you don't hate him.

1030
01:52:50,702 --> 01:52:54,247
I hate him, and I hope
he never comes back.

1031
01:53:28,072 --> 01:53:29,949
It's the children.

1032
01:53:30,992 --> 01:53:31,993
Abigale!

1033
01:53:33,912 --> 01:53:35,455
You're alive!

1034
01:53:45,590 --> 01:53:49,427
I know it's not much,
but you can stay here with me.

1035
01:54:08,488 --> 01:54:10,949
It's beautiful.

1036
01:54:11,491 --> 01:54:13,076
Thank you.

1037
01:54:25,380 --> 01:54:29,217
She spoke. Susan talked to you?

1038
01:54:29,426 --> 01:54:31,052
In full sentences.

1039
01:54:31,302 --> 01:54:33,930
As if she'd been speaking all along.

1040
01:54:36,307 --> 01:54:38,101
Damn, I wasn't there for it.

1041
01:54:39,477 --> 01:54:40,562
What did she say?

1042
01:54:43,148 --> 01:54:44,941
She said...

1043
01:54:46,443 --> 01:54:49,571
...that she loves you
and misses you...

1044
01:54:49,988 --> 01:54:52,282
...but understands
why you can't be with her.

1045
01:54:55,660 --> 01:54:57,454
My Lord, she said that.

1046
01:54:58,163 --> 01:54:58,955
Isn't that something?

1047
01:55:03,718 --> 01:55:06,554
Tavington has a list of our men.
He's burning our homes...

1048
01:55:06,804 --> 01:55:08,639
...killing whomever resists.

1049
01:55:09,307 --> 01:55:12,727
- Where?
- Seven homes along the Santee so far.

1050
01:56:00,775 --> 01:56:02,652
John.

1051
01:56:11,452 --> 01:56:13,788
John, this is not a time
for vengeance.

1052
01:56:14,664 --> 01:56:17,250
This is a time for mourning.

1053
01:56:21,879 --> 01:56:23,631
John.

1054
01:56:32,390 --> 01:56:33,683
No!

1055
01:56:51,701 --> 01:56:53,453
Attend to your families.

1056
01:56:55,830 --> 01:56:58,124
One week furlough for all men.

1057
01:56:58,958 --> 01:57:03,254
Any man who does not return will not
be thought a coward or uncommitted.

1058
01:57:19,353 --> 01:57:20,688
Father!

1059
01:57:22,106 --> 01:57:23,816
Papa!

1060
01:57:29,864 --> 01:57:32,033
They're huge.
What have you been feeding them?

1061
01:57:32,200 --> 01:57:35,328
They're from good stock
on their father's side.

1062
01:57:44,003 --> 01:57:45,296
Susan?

1063
01:58:25,461 --> 01:58:28,840
I see it. There it is. Look.
Look, Father.

1064
01:58:30,925 --> 01:58:32,885
I got it! I got it!

1065
01:58:33,261 --> 01:58:34,303
You got it.

1066
01:58:35,096 --> 01:58:36,472
I got it!

1067
01:58:36,681 --> 01:58:37,765
- Careful.
- I caught it.

1068
01:58:37,974 --> 01:58:40,601
- All the fish are over here.
- Let's get them.

1069
01:58:47,483 --> 01:58:49,360
Father, what changed you?

1070
01:58:51,779 --> 01:58:53,656
Are you sure I have?

1071
01:58:53,865 --> 01:58:56,826
Yes. You changed.

1072
01:59:04,292 --> 01:59:05,668
That's simple.

1073
01:59:06,377 --> 01:59:07,420
It was your mother.

1074
01:59:12,842 --> 01:59:15,762
A woman can have a strange effect
on a man.

1075
01:59:17,054 --> 01:59:18,681
There were times...

1076
01:59:19,348 --> 01:59:21,601
...I had trouble breathing
around your mother.

1077
01:59:22,810 --> 01:59:24,479
I know the feeling.

1078
01:59:26,564 --> 01:59:28,191
You once said...

1079
01:59:31,152 --> 01:59:33,696
...when I had a family of my own,
I'd understand.

1080
01:59:37,658 --> 01:59:39,202
You were right.

1081
01:59:41,788 --> 01:59:43,664
You're trying to tell me something.

1082
02:00:00,556 --> 02:00:01,933
- Apple?
- Thank you.

1083
02:00:08,940 --> 02:00:09,982
Congratulations.

1084
02:00:10,358 --> 02:00:12,026
<i>Anne Patricia Howard...</i>

1085
02:00:12,318 --> 02:00:16,447
...will you have this man to be
your husband to live in marriage?

1086
02:00:16,781 --> 02:00:19,367
Will you love, comfort
and honor him...

1087
02:00:19,575 --> 02:00:21,786
...for so long as you both shall live?

1088
02:00:22,370 --> 02:00:23,746
I will.

1089
02:00:24,163 --> 02:00:27,375
Gabriel Edward Martin, will you have
this woman to be your wife...

1090
02:00:27,583 --> 02:00:30,253
...to live together
in the covenant of marriage?

1091
02:00:30,628 --> 02:00:34,549
Will you love, comfort and honor her
as long as you both shall live?

1092
02:00:35,007 --> 02:00:36,050
I will.

1093
02:00:36,300 --> 02:00:39,137
Then by the power vested in me
by our mutual faith...

1094
02:00:39,387 --> 02:00:41,264
...in the Lord, our God...

1095
02:00:41,514 --> 02:00:44,809
...I now pronounce you man and wife.

1096
02:01:11,961 --> 02:01:14,213
I'm sorry we didn't give you
more warning.

1097
02:01:14,422 --> 02:01:15,465
It's fine.

1098
02:01:16,048 --> 02:01:17,467
I have something for you.

1099
02:01:20,219 --> 02:01:21,929
It belonged to Gabriel's mother.

1100
02:01:22,180 --> 02:01:23,890
It's beautiful.

1101
02:01:24,891 --> 02:01:26,100
Allow me.

1102
02:01:27,477 --> 02:01:28,936
It's the North Star.

1103
02:01:29,520 --> 02:01:33,107
That's the only star in the sky
that never moves.

1104
02:01:33,399 --> 02:01:36,444
It's constant, unwavering.

1105
02:01:36,944 --> 02:01:38,279
A guide.

1106
02:01:41,741 --> 02:01:43,367
I'd be honored.

1107
02:01:48,623 --> 02:01:49,665
May I?

1108
02:01:49,874 --> 02:01:51,959
- If you must.
- I must.

1109
02:02:08,226 --> 02:02:09,727
May I sit with you?

1110
02:02:09,894 --> 02:02:11,979
It's a free country.

1111
02:02:12,730 --> 02:02:14,065
Or at least it will be.

1112
02:02:26,411 --> 02:02:28,496
I'm not my sister.

1113
02:02:29,539 --> 02:02:31,207
I know that.

1114
02:02:31,791 --> 02:02:33,376
Do you?

1115
02:02:34,669 --> 02:02:36,212
Yes, I do.

1116
02:02:37,255 --> 02:02:38,840
Very well, then.

1117
02:02:43,261 --> 02:02:44,303
Well?

1118
02:02:46,180 --> 02:02:47,432
Well what?

1119
02:03:09,662 --> 02:03:11,414
I'll see you in Pembroke soon.

1120
02:03:11,706 --> 02:03:13,458
Not soon enough.

1121
02:03:14,125 --> 02:03:16,043
I'm counting on you to make sure...

1122
02:03:16,252 --> 02:03:17,670
- I know.
- What?

1123
02:03:18,004 --> 02:03:21,549
- Say my prayers, take care of everyone.
- Couldn't have said it better.

1124
02:03:26,345 --> 02:03:27,388
Goodbye.

1125
02:03:27,972 --> 02:03:29,140
Goodbye.

1126
02:03:49,410 --> 02:03:50,661
Goodbye, Susan.

1127
02:03:53,122 --> 02:03:54,415
Goodbye?

1128
02:03:57,543 --> 02:03:59,212
Just one word, that's all I want.

1129
02:04:08,429 --> 02:04:09,514
All right.

1130
02:04:37,208 --> 02:04:38,626
Papa!

1131
02:04:41,295 --> 02:04:43,673
Papa, don't go! I'll say anything.

1132
02:04:48,386 --> 02:04:49,804
Please, Papa.

1133
02:04:52,223 --> 02:04:54,267
I'll say anything you want.

1134
02:04:54,475 --> 02:04:57,603
Tell me what you want me to say.
I'll say anything.

1135
02:05:00,481 --> 02:05:03,276
I promise, Papa. Please don't go.

1136
02:05:04,402 --> 02:05:05,737
I promise.

1137
02:05:06,612 --> 02:05:08,072
I'll come back.

1138
02:05:08,906 --> 02:05:10,950
I'll come back. You believe me?

1139
02:05:14,370 --> 02:05:16,456
You know, you make me very happy.

1140
02:05:52,408 --> 02:05:54,077
Just the three of us?

1141
02:05:54,619 --> 02:05:57,038
John Raskin did come by earlier.

1142
02:05:57,872 --> 02:05:59,791
He looked around, then he left.

1143
02:06:00,875 --> 02:06:02,210
He would've made four.

1144
02:06:02,710 --> 02:06:04,462
Four would have been better.

1145
02:06:39,747 --> 02:06:43,084
I got another two months to go
before I get to twelve months.

1146
02:06:48,506 --> 02:06:49,549
Colonel.

1147
02:06:50,716 --> 02:06:52,009
Reverend.

1148
02:06:55,513 --> 02:06:56,973
Trust the French.

1149
02:06:57,682 --> 02:06:58,975
Yes, trust the French.

1150
02:06:59,183 --> 02:07:02,770
Where else do I get the opportunity
to kill a few Redcoats?

1151
02:07:03,312 --> 02:07:06,524
Perhaps a few wounded ones
when you are not looking.

1152
02:07:33,134 --> 02:07:35,219
Everyone must gather at the church.

1153
02:07:35,845 --> 02:07:36,888
Mr. Wilkins?

1154
02:07:38,347 --> 02:07:41,476
Colonel Tavington wishes to address
the whole village.

1155
02:07:59,118 --> 02:08:03,247
This town has given aid to
Benjamin Martin and his rebels.

1156
02:08:03,831 --> 02:08:05,666
I wish to know his whereabouts.

1157
02:08:07,126 --> 02:08:08,461
So...

1158
02:08:08,586 --> 02:08:10,588
...anyone who comes forward...

1159
02:08:10,963 --> 02:08:13,132
...may be forgiven their treason.

1160
02:08:18,805 --> 02:08:19,847
Very well.

1161
02:08:20,056 --> 02:08:22,558
- You had your chance.
- Wait!

1162
02:08:23,684 --> 02:08:25,895
- This man gives them supplies.
- Quiet!

1163
02:08:26,104 --> 02:08:28,064
- He brings them to Black Swamp.
- Liar!

1164
02:08:28,272 --> 02:08:30,358
In the marsh,
by the old Spanish mission.

1165
02:08:31,359 --> 02:08:32,527
This man here?

1166
02:08:32,944 --> 02:08:34,904
- Yes.
- The Black Swamp, you say?

1167
02:08:35,279 --> 02:08:37,281
By the old Spanish mission.

1168
02:08:39,367 --> 02:08:40,785
Thank you very much.

1169
02:08:46,958 --> 02:08:48,501
Shut the doors.

1170
02:08:50,711 --> 02:08:52,672
But you said we'd be forgiven.

1171
02:08:52,880 --> 02:08:54,132
And indeed you may!

1172
02:08:56,884 --> 02:08:58,553
That's between you and God.

1173
02:09:05,768 --> 02:09:06,978
Be strong. We must.

1174
02:09:09,063 --> 02:09:10,773
I'll fire the town on your orders.

1175
02:09:10,940 --> 02:09:12,191
The town?

1176
02:09:13,067 --> 02:09:14,610
Burn the church.

1177
02:09:17,155 --> 02:09:18,906
There's no honor in this.

1178
02:09:21,242 --> 02:09:24,036
Didn't you say all those who stand
against England...

1179
02:09:24,245 --> 02:09:26,748
...deserve to die a traitor's death?

1180
02:09:29,417 --> 02:09:32,003
Burn the church, captain.

1181
02:09:44,223 --> 02:09:45,266
Give me the torch.

1182
02:10:28,309 --> 02:10:30,937
The honor is found in the end,
not the means.

1183
02:10:32,230 --> 02:10:33,940
This will be forgotten.

1184
02:10:34,565 --> 02:10:35,817
Bordon.

1185
02:12:15,458 --> 02:12:16,751
Anne!

1186
02:12:20,922 --> 02:12:22,590
Mrs. Howard?

1187
02:12:26,761 --> 02:12:28,513
Where is everybody?

1188
02:12:33,434 --> 02:12:35,520
They're not here.

1189
02:13:43,796 --> 02:13:45,339
Gabriel's gone.

1190
02:14:30,635 --> 02:14:33,012
To arms! To arms!

1191
02:18:52,647 --> 02:18:53,940
Father.

1192
02:18:55,358 --> 02:18:57,527
Just don't talk. Don't talk.

1193
02:19:03,991 --> 02:19:05,118
Father.

1194
02:19:05,493 --> 02:19:07,829
- I'm sorry.
- Be quiet.

1195
02:19:08,037 --> 02:19:10,164
I'll take care of you.
You'll be all right.

1196
02:19:13,209 --> 02:19:16,796
I'm sorry about Thomas.

1197
02:19:22,719 --> 02:19:25,054
Oh, son, that wasn't your fault.

1198
02:19:29,142 --> 02:19:30,393
That was mine.

1199
02:19:34,689 --> 02:19:37,817
Hold on. You're gonna be all right.

1200
02:19:40,611 --> 02:19:43,531
Don't go. Gabriel, don't.

1201
02:20:12,602 --> 02:20:14,896
Oh, God help me. God help me.

1202
02:20:48,971 --> 02:20:50,264
Where is he?

1203
02:20:58,106 --> 02:21:00,108
I'll help you bury him.

1204
02:21:02,276 --> 02:21:03,611
I'll bury him.

1205
02:21:06,864 --> 02:21:09,575
My wife in Alexandria is with child.

1206
02:21:11,119 --> 02:21:12,703
My first.

1207
02:21:13,454 --> 02:21:15,331
I fight for that child.

1208
02:21:17,917 --> 02:21:20,461
Benjamin, nothing will replace
your sons.

1209
02:21:21,796 --> 02:21:25,967
But if you come with us,
you can justify their sacrifice.

1210
02:21:27,802 --> 02:21:29,220
Why?

1211
02:21:30,972 --> 02:21:34,976
Why do men feel
they can justify death?

1212
02:21:41,566 --> 02:21:43,484
Is it arrogance or?

1213
02:21:48,156 --> 02:21:50,158
I have long feared...

1214
02:21:51,868 --> 02:21:55,413
...that my sins would return
to visit me.

1215
02:21:58,374 --> 02:22:01,002
And the cost is more than I can bear.

1216
02:22:02,336 --> 02:22:06,174
Benjamin, we have a chance.

1217
02:22:06,716 --> 02:22:09,927
Greene and Dan Morgan are
down from Virginia.

1218
02:22:12,638 --> 02:22:16,184
If we win this next battle, victory
in the war is within our grasp.

1219
02:22:16,309 --> 02:22:17,351
Go, then.

1220
02:22:17,685 --> 02:22:19,437
Seek your victory.

1221
02:22:22,857 --> 02:22:25,943
- I'm small issue to it.
- You're wrong, Benjamin.

1222
02:22:26,694 --> 02:22:28,696
You matter to your men...

1223
02:22:30,198 --> 02:22:31,949
...and to others as well.

1224
02:22:32,533 --> 02:22:34,327
Your victories...

1225
02:22:34,535 --> 02:22:36,412
...and your losses...

1226
02:22:37,705 --> 02:22:39,957
...are shared by more than you know.

1227
02:22:41,042 --> 02:22:43,211
Stay with us.

1228
02:22:43,711 --> 02:22:45,505
Stay the course.

1229
02:22:55,431 --> 02:22:57,558
I have run my course.

1230
02:23:17,578 --> 02:23:19,914
You men will be leaving with us.

1231
02:23:22,917 --> 02:23:24,460
Prepare the baggage.

1232
02:24:28,983 --> 02:24:30,026
Jean.

1233
02:25:28,543 --> 02:25:30,670
You will be missed tomorrow, colonel.

1234
02:25:31,003 --> 02:25:33,381
- Missed, my lord?
- Your wound.

1235
02:25:34,632 --> 02:25:37,009
It's nothing, my lord.

1236
02:25:37,343 --> 02:25:40,430
I am, as ever, ready to serve.

1237
02:25:40,596 --> 02:25:42,473
Very well.

1238
02:25:42,640 --> 02:25:45,059
Make sure you do.

1239
02:25:45,601 --> 02:25:49,021
I stand on the eve of the greatest
victory of my career. Don't fail me.

1240
02:25:49,981 --> 02:25:54,777
My efforts in no small measure
have brought you here.

1241
02:25:54,944 --> 02:25:56,571
I grant you that small measure...

1242
02:25:56,738 --> 02:26:00,241
...in spite of your failure
to deliver the ghost to me.

1243
02:26:01,242 --> 02:26:02,869
Thus far.

1244
02:26:04,120 --> 02:26:07,165
I will not tolerate
a premature charge...

1245
02:26:07,331 --> 02:26:11,169
...born of your eagerness for glory.

1246
02:26:11,586 --> 02:26:14,964
Wait for my order.

1247
02:26:15,339 --> 02:26:19,677
Or you may abandon
any hope of Ohio.

1248
02:26:23,139 --> 02:26:26,309
Tomorrow's battle can alter
the course of the war.

1249
02:26:26,517 --> 02:26:29,520
General Greene, what exactly is
the task before us?

1250
02:26:29,687 --> 02:26:32,815
Gentlemen,
Cornwallis has us cornered.

1251
02:26:33,483 --> 02:26:35,193
Not only does he outnumber us...

1252
02:26:35,401 --> 02:26:38,446
...but nearly half of our force
is militia.

1253
02:26:39,781 --> 02:26:42,075
Unreliable, at best.

1254
02:26:42,408 --> 02:26:44,243
Excuse me, sir.

1255
02:26:45,953 --> 02:26:47,705
You underestimate our militia.

1256
02:26:49,916 --> 02:26:51,292
All of you do.

1257
02:26:52,085 --> 02:26:54,712
We've seen our militia lines break
time and again.

1258
02:26:54,962 --> 02:26:56,589
Kips Bay, Princeton.

1259
02:26:56,798 --> 02:26:58,883
But the British have seen that too.

1260
02:26:59,926 --> 02:27:03,721
Cornwallis' own letters bear out that
he has no respect for the militia.

1261
02:27:04,472 --> 02:27:06,849
What are you suggesting, Ben?

1262
02:27:08,267 --> 02:27:10,186
I'm suggesting we use that.

1263
02:27:17,360 --> 02:27:21,364
I know you men have sacrificed
a lot so far.

1264
02:27:21,572 --> 02:27:24,951
But all I'm asking is that you...

1265
02:27:25,159 --> 02:27:28,329
...let the front line of the militia
fire two shots tomorrow.

1266
02:27:30,498 --> 02:27:33,584
A lot can happen in the time it takes
to fire two shots.

1267
02:27:33,876 --> 02:27:36,337
Especially against British Regulars.

1268
02:27:37,338 --> 02:27:41,092
Indeed. That's why I'm not asking you
to fire three.

1269
02:28:38,232 --> 02:28:40,610
If I die, I will die well dressed.

1270
02:29:26,823 --> 02:29:27,949
Fire!

1271
02:29:31,786 --> 02:29:34,664
- Battalion!
- Company, halt!

1272
02:29:51,764 --> 02:29:52,849
Harry...

1273
02:29:53,808 --> 02:29:55,768
...will you give this to my children?

1274
02:30:06,320 --> 02:30:07,488
Thank you.

1275
02:30:16,706 --> 02:30:18,416
It's October now.

1276
02:30:21,044 --> 02:30:22,211
I know.

1277
02:30:23,212 --> 02:30:25,131
It's more than 12 months.

1278
02:30:25,590 --> 02:30:26,883
You're a free man.

1279
02:30:28,051 --> 02:30:30,845
I'm here now on my own accord.

1280
02:30:34,682 --> 02:30:36,768
I'm honored to have you with us.

1281
02:30:39,103 --> 02:30:40,354
Honored.

1282
02:30:41,981 --> 02:30:44,525
Shoulder arms!

1283
02:30:50,239 --> 02:30:51,866
Forward...

1284
02:30:52,658 --> 02:30:53,951
...march!

1285
02:30:58,915 --> 02:31:00,708
How old were your daughters?

1286
02:31:02,794 --> 02:31:05,296
Violette was 12 and Pauline, 10.

1287
02:31:06,464 --> 02:31:08,424
They had green eyes.

1288
02:31:09,717 --> 02:31:11,469
I'm sure they were lovely.

1289
02:31:13,137 --> 02:31:14,931
Yes, they were.

1290
02:31:26,651 --> 02:31:27,860
- Battalion!
- Company!

1291
02:31:28,236 --> 02:31:29,404
March!

1292
02:31:31,614 --> 02:31:32,907
Fire!

1293
02:31:35,660 --> 02:31:36,911
Unless I'm dreaming...

1294
02:31:37,620 --> 02:31:41,457
...I believe I see militia forming
at their center.

1295
02:31:56,013 --> 02:31:58,349
Battalion, halt!

1296
02:32:16,492 --> 02:32:18,327
Dress ranks!

1297
02:32:27,128 --> 02:32:28,629
Make ready!

1298
02:32:40,349 --> 02:32:42,185
Battalion!

1299
02:32:42,393 --> 02:32:43,436
Halt!

1300
02:32:46,522 --> 02:32:47,690
Take aim!

1301
02:32:51,194 --> 02:32:52,236
Fire!

1302
02:33:03,331 --> 02:33:04,415
Fire!

1303
02:33:25,436 --> 02:33:26,687
Hold the line!

1304
02:33:32,652 --> 02:33:35,905
- Prepare to charge!
- We haven't been given that order.

1305
02:33:36,155 --> 02:33:37,532
Charge!

1306
02:33:38,699 --> 02:33:39,784
Charge!

1307
02:33:43,329 --> 02:33:44,705
Tavington.

1308
02:33:44,914 --> 02:33:47,125
Damn him! Damn that man!

1309
02:33:49,001 --> 02:33:50,503
Make ready.

1310
02:33:51,087 --> 02:33:52,588
Take aim!

1311
02:33:53,464 --> 02:33:54,507
Fire!

1312
02:33:55,800 --> 02:33:57,009
Take aim!

1313
02:33:58,052 --> 02:33:59,220
Fire!

1314
02:33:59,262 --> 02:34:00,388
Retreat!

1315
02:34:06,394 --> 02:34:10,440
Bayonet charge. We'll see who takes
the glory from this field.

1316
02:34:10,815 --> 02:34:12,400
Charge!

1317
02:34:32,295 --> 02:34:33,504
Congratulations, my lord.

1318
02:34:33,921 --> 02:34:35,548
Infantry reserve into the center.

1319
02:34:35,590 --> 02:34:37,050
But you've taken the field.

1320
02:34:37,258 --> 02:34:38,634
Now we'll take their spirits.

1321
02:34:38,718 --> 02:34:41,846
Send the battalion over that hill
and crush them.

1322
02:34:42,096 --> 02:34:43,556
It ends today.

1323
02:35:06,829 --> 02:35:07,914
Hold the charge!

1324
02:35:08,956 --> 02:35:09,999
Fire!

1325
02:35:10,249 --> 02:35:12,543
Hold the charge!

1326
02:35:16,255 --> 02:35:17,673
Fire!

1327
02:35:23,221 --> 02:35:24,305
Take aim!

1328
02:35:25,973 --> 02:35:27,600
Fire!

1329
02:35:35,858 --> 02:35:37,402
Charge!

1330
02:35:44,242 --> 02:35:45,827
Charge bayonets!

1331
02:36:15,022 --> 02:36:16,190
Halt!

1332
02:36:17,400 --> 02:36:18,818
Hold! Dress your ranks!

1333
02:36:21,446 --> 02:36:22,655
Fire!

1334
02:36:26,117 --> 02:36:27,702
Charge!

1335
02:36:51,350 --> 02:36:53,019
Retreat!

1336
02:36:58,274 --> 02:36:59,358
Colonel!

1337
02:37:01,277 --> 02:37:02,612
The line is faltering!

1338
02:37:04,155 --> 02:37:06,657
Retreat! Retreat!

1339
02:37:14,540 --> 02:37:15,958
Wait!

1340
02:37:16,751 --> 02:37:18,503
No retreat!

1341
02:37:22,298 --> 02:37:24,509
Hold the line!

1342
02:37:26,135 --> 02:37:28,262
Hold the line!

1343
02:37:39,982 --> 02:37:43,027
Push forward, men!

1344
02:38:32,493 --> 02:38:34,787
Artillery, concentrate on the center.

1345
02:38:50,011 --> 02:38:53,723
If we reform and wheel right,
we may be able to turn their flank.

1346
02:38:54,015 --> 02:38:55,933
You dream, general.

1347
02:41:58,449 --> 02:42:00,827
Kill me before the war is over,
will you?

1348
02:42:02,662 --> 02:42:05,331
It appears you are not...

1349
02:42:05,540 --> 02:42:07,750
...the better man.

1350
02:42:21,431 --> 02:42:22,473
You're right.

1351
02:42:27,270 --> 02:42:29,397
My sons were better men.

1352
02:42:57,133 --> 02:42:58,593
Sound the retreat.

1353
02:43:02,138 --> 02:43:03,598
Sound...

1354
02:43:04,724 --> 02:43:05,933
...retreat.

1355
02:43:23,951 --> 02:43:24,994
<i>Dear Charlotte:</i>

1356
02:43:25,745 --> 02:43:27,372
<i>The war has turned.</i>

1357
02:43:27,705 --> 02:43:31,209
<i>General Cornwallis took flight
with his army and moved north.</i>

1358
02:43:31,376 --> 02:43:34,587
<i>We continued to engage the British,
and in the following months...</i>

1359
02:43:34,670 --> 02:43:38,007
<i>...Cornwallis entrenched himself
at Yorktown, Virginia.</i>

1360
02:43:39,634 --> 02:43:41,803
<i>Washington escaped from the north...</i>

1361
02:43:41,969 --> 02:43:45,098
<i>...and surrounded Cornwallis,
who could not retreat to the seas.</i>

1362
02:43:45,556 --> 02:43:48,768
<i>It was blocked off by
our long-lost friends...</i>

1363
02:43:49,018 --> 02:43:51,354
<i>...who had finally arrived.</i>

1364
02:43:56,025 --> 02:43:57,443
<i>Vive la France.</i>

1365
02:44:00,154 --> 02:44:01,739
<i>Vive la liberté.</i>

1366
02:44:13,918 --> 02:44:15,795
My lord, I beseech you.

1367
02:44:16,379 --> 02:44:18,673
You must order the surrender.

1368
02:44:19,507 --> 02:44:22,635
How could it come to this?
An army of rabble.

1369
02:44:23,344 --> 02:44:24,721
Peasants.

1370
02:44:26,806 --> 02:44:28,891
Everything will change.

1371
02:44:32,395 --> 02:44:34,397
Everything has changed.

1372
02:44:35,148 --> 02:44:37,233
<i>Though he eventually surrendered...</i>

1373
02:44:37,442 --> 02:44:39,902
<i>...Cornwallis himself hid in shame...</i>

1374
02:44:40,111 --> 02:44:43,698
<i>...appointing his subordinate to
relinquish his sword.</i>

1375
02:44:44,907 --> 02:44:48,035
<i>With the war ending,
and our militia disbanding...</i>

1376
02:44:48,244 --> 02:44:50,788
<i>...I take measure of what
we have lost...</i>

1377
02:44:51,122 --> 02:44:52,665
<i>...and what we have won.</i>

1378
02:44:53,833 --> 02:44:58,546
<i>My hope and prayer is that
the sacrifices borne by so many...</i>

1379
02:44:58,796 --> 02:45:02,633
<i>...will spawn and fulfill the promise
of our new nation.</i>

1380
02:45:04,052 --> 02:45:07,972
<i>Tell the children, and especially
Susan, that I will keep my promise...</i>

1381
02:45:08,181 --> 02:45:11,642
<i>...as I will be returning
to you all soon.</i>

1382
02:45:17,899 --> 02:45:19,609
Where will you go now?

1383
02:45:20,359 --> 02:45:22,612
Home. Start over.

1384
02:45:22,862 --> 02:45:25,198
Your wife's expecting a child,
isn't she?

1385
02:45:25,406 --> 02:45:28,159
She gave birth to a son
three weeks ago.

1386
02:45:29,327 --> 02:45:30,703
What'd you name him?

1387
02:45:32,789 --> 02:45:34,791
We named him Gabriel.

1388
02:45:40,380 --> 02:45:41,422
Thank you, Harry.

1389
02:45:48,638 --> 02:45:51,265
Gabriel is a good name for a farmer.

1390
02:45:51,849 --> 02:45:54,268
It is. It is.

1391
02:45:54,811 --> 02:45:55,937
Jean.

1392
02:45:56,187 --> 02:45:57,230
Ben.

1393
02:47:04,630 --> 02:47:07,341
Gabriel said if we won the war...

1394
02:47:07,717 --> 02:47:09,677
...we could build a whole new world.

1395
02:47:10,511 --> 02:47:13,473
Just figured we'd get started
right here...

1396
02:47:14,891 --> 02:47:16,601
...with your home.

1397
02:47:20,605 --> 02:47:21,981
Sounds good.

1398
02:47:25,443 --> 02:47:26,486
Thank you.

1399
02:47:31,282 --> 02:47:32,325
Ma'am.
