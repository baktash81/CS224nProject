1
00:02:14,703 --> 00:02:15,568
How's it look?

2
00:02:15,953 --> 00:02:17,908
Like a New Mexican shithole.

3
00:02:18,703 --> 00:02:20,361
Perfect spot for a nest.

4
00:02:27,121 --> 00:02:28,697
Let's hit it.

5
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:08,534
All right. Gio?

6
00:05:10,167 --> 00:05:12,490
Bene dica vow omnipotens deus.

7
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:16,826
In nomine Patrius, et Filius,
et Spiritus Sanctus. Amen.

8
00:05:17,792 --> 00:05:19,866
- Everything set?
- Ready, boss.

9
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:21,997
We got a nest
inside this place.

10
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:24,782
Figure at least six goons,
maybe more.

11
00:05:25,042 --> 00:05:27,033
Chances are,
we'll find the master.

12
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:31,665
You find the nest, you find the master.
He usually won't leave it.

13
00:05:31,917 --> 00:05:34,702
It's strictly by the book today.
Questions?

14
00:05:38,501 --> 00:05:40,159
Let's get to work.

15
00:06:42,252 --> 00:06:44,657
- I'll do it, boss.
- My turn.

16
00:08:06,589 --> 00:08:07,786
Anthony?

17
00:08:08,047 --> 00:08:09,954
Easy with that door.
Slow...

18
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:11,460
...and easy.

19
00:08:11,714 --> 00:08:13,503
Sorry, boss.

20
00:08:15,422 --> 00:08:16,334
Jesus!

21
00:08:24,422 --> 00:08:26,127
- What was that?
- I don't know.

22
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:36,792
Did I wake you, Montoya?

23
00:08:37,922 --> 00:08:40,410
Relax. Dead body.
Bled out and cold.

24
00:08:40,672 --> 00:08:42,662
Dead body.
Bled out and cold.

25
00:08:43,463 --> 00:08:45,170
Suck it up.

26
00:09:53,757 --> 00:09:54,836
Bambi!

27
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:56,829
Get it off!

28
00:09:57,091 --> 00:09:58,798
Wait! Hold your fire!

29
00:10:06,008 --> 00:10:07,252
Now! Fire!

30
00:10:16,883 --> 00:10:18,921
- What?
- I don't know. Hang on.

31
00:10:22,134 --> 00:10:23,959
What's going on in there?

32
00:10:28,051 --> 00:10:30,456
Big Deyo, what's going on in there?

33
00:10:30,884 --> 00:10:33,005
We got a live one.
Female goon.

34
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:36,751
We'll save her for you.

35
00:10:41,592 --> 00:10:42,540
Open wide, baby.

36
00:10:53,301 --> 00:10:54,497
Anthony, stick her!

37
00:10:57,217 --> 00:10:59,338
Clear! Take that!

38
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:04,251
Ortega, we got a fish! Go!

39
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,045
Go from Montoya.

40
00:11:12,468 --> 00:11:13,582
We're losing him!

41
00:11:14,218 --> 00:11:15,296
Bambi, reload!

42
00:11:22,551 --> 00:11:23,925
Shit!

43
00:11:30,135 --> 00:11:31,048
Catlin!

44
00:11:31,302 --> 00:11:32,215
Safety on, boss!

45
00:11:32,469 --> 00:11:33,961
- Got it?
- Clear! Clear!

46
00:11:39,385 --> 00:11:40,215
Oh, Lord.

47
00:11:50,135 --> 00:11:51,166
Take over.

48
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,509
Come on! Right here.

49
00:12:01,845 --> 00:12:02,674
Die!

50
00:12:08,469 --> 00:12:11,218
Fucking die! Die!

51
00:12:17,887 --> 00:12:20,755
Fuck it! Not only ugly,
he smells bad. Jeez!

52
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:22,463
Give me the radio.

53
00:12:23,345 --> 00:12:25,549
- Everybody okay?
- Yeah, boss.

54
00:12:25,804 --> 00:12:28,718
Got another one. He's dead.
Send in the cable.

55
00:12:28,929 --> 00:12:30,421
Give me a minute.

56
00:12:31,887 --> 00:12:34,589
May her soul and the souls
of the departed...

57
00:12:34,845 --> 00:12:37,465
...with the mercy of God,
rest in peace.

58
00:12:37,721 --> 00:12:39,131
Amen.

59
00:12:49,429 --> 00:12:51,835
Nothing like a little head,
eh, Padre?

60
00:13:01,389 --> 00:13:04,173
Okay, boys. Time to mop it up.

61
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:07,464
Deyo, Ortega, Bambi. Upstairs.

62
00:13:07,722 --> 00:13:09,179
Catlin, Anthony, Davis.

63
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:10,798
Basement.

64
00:13:29,513 --> 00:13:32,049
Enjoy the barbecue, baby!

65
00:14:17,057 --> 00:14:18,431
One, two, three, four...

66
00:14:18,682 --> 00:14:20,056
...five, six, seven, eight...

67
00:14:20,307 --> 00:14:23,304
...nine! Goons, man!

68
00:14:23,515 --> 00:14:26,003
It's not a bad day's work.

69
00:14:26,598 --> 00:14:28,802
You the man!

70
00:14:30,641 --> 00:14:32,880
What is it, Jack?
Is something wrong?

71
00:14:33,307 --> 00:14:35,974
Yeah. Where was the master?

72
00:14:36,224 --> 00:14:38,713
- Want us to check once more?
- He's not there.

73
00:14:41,516 --> 00:14:44,549
You don't suppose
there's another nest, do you?

74
00:14:45,891 --> 00:14:48,095
Sure as hell better not be.

75
00:14:49,349 --> 00:14:51,838
- Let's get out of here.
- Get the hookers!

76
00:15:36,017 --> 00:15:37,594
Thank you for all your help.

77
00:15:37,852 --> 00:15:41,680
Father, I've spent two weeks
running whores and buying liquor.

78
00:15:41,893 --> 00:15:44,761
- When are they leaving?
- We're clearing out tomorrow.

79
00:15:44,976 --> 00:15:47,263
I can't say that
I'm sorry to hear it.

80
00:15:49,435 --> 00:15:51,424
You get that little package from us?

81
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:52,928
Yeah, I got it.

82
00:15:53,184 --> 00:15:54,807
Good, then you're happy.

83
00:15:55,059 --> 00:15:56,765
You all work together?

84
00:15:57,017 --> 00:15:58,723
That's right.

85
00:15:58,934 --> 00:16:00,593
What do you do?

86
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:02,599
We kill vampires.

87
00:16:02,851 --> 00:16:05,174
I briefed Rome.
They're wiring a payment.

88
00:16:05,435 --> 00:16:07,923
- Thanks, Gio.
- Cardinal Alba's flying in.

89
00:16:08,185 --> 00:16:10,638
- He wants to see you tomorrow.
- It's my day off.

90
00:16:10,893 --> 00:16:13,725
Jack. Not anymore.

91
00:16:15,476 --> 00:16:17,266
What happened to the master?

92
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:19,176
I don't know, Padre.

93
00:16:19,434 --> 00:16:22,054
A master won't leave
a nest filled with goons.

94
00:16:22,269 --> 00:16:25,385
What says he's in New Mexico?
He could be anywhere.

95
00:16:25,602 --> 00:16:28,766
Why would he run? It's not like
he knew we were coming.

96
00:16:29,019 --> 00:16:30,974
No, really. What do you guys do?

97
00:16:31,185 --> 00:16:34,018
I'm not kidding. We kill vampires.

98
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:36,803
Tell the lady what we do.

99
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:39,305
Kill vampires. Hunt them down.

100
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,509
Kick the shit out of them.

101
00:16:44,102 --> 00:16:45,051
Right.

102
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:49,139
I know how you feel, baby.
Nobody believes in vampires.

103
00:16:49,395 --> 00:16:53,719
See, the thing is, we know
vampires are stalking the earth.

104
00:16:53,978 --> 00:16:56,015
We also know there's a God too.

105
00:16:56,269 --> 00:16:58,936
We just don't understand him.

106
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:02,267
Nice party.

107
00:17:07,479 --> 00:17:11,223
You look like you got something
other than me on your mind.

108
00:17:11,437 --> 00:17:13,309
Feel like telling me about it?

109
00:17:15,395 --> 00:17:17,635
I was looking for something
I didn't find.

110
00:17:20,812 --> 00:17:22,221
That's a pain in the ass.

111
00:17:28,395 --> 00:17:31,228
Maybe you should try
looking somewhere else?

112
00:17:33,104 --> 00:17:35,593
I can tell you where you
might wanna start.

113
00:17:36,729 --> 00:17:38,720
Well, Jesus, you're right.

114
00:17:40,271 --> 00:17:43,352
I should've been looking in
a whole different place.

115
00:17:47,229 --> 00:17:49,896
So why don't you get me
something to drink?

116
00:17:50,146 --> 00:17:53,015
And we can meet back in your...

117
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:54,978
...room.

118
00:18:00,897 --> 00:18:03,516
That's the first good idea
I heard today.

119
00:18:49,981 --> 00:18:52,267
Deyo, give me a couple beers,
will you?

120
00:18:55,397 --> 00:18:58,810
You're magnificent, you know?
Have I ever told you that?

121
00:18:59,022 --> 00:19:01,891
- Slow down, Padre.
- No, I'm not drunk.

122
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:04,974
Oh, really?
What are you on, acid?

123
00:19:37,274 --> 00:19:38,980
Doesn't it feel beautiful?

124
00:19:39,566 --> 00:19:42,054
Something you'll never forget.

125
00:19:42,982 --> 00:19:44,973
I know I won't.

126
00:19:58,608 --> 00:20:01,689
I think we're out of beer.

127
00:20:01,941 --> 00:20:05,224
I think we ought to
knock over a liquor store.

128
00:20:05,483 --> 00:20:08,731
Hell, why not?
I don't give a shit anymore.

129
00:20:12,526 --> 00:20:14,895
I got beer.

130
00:20:15,151 --> 00:20:17,106
Got beer in the other room.

131
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:21,435
Fucking people. I don't know why
I gotta take care of everybody.

132
00:20:23,734 --> 00:20:24,682
And you.

133
00:20:25,567 --> 00:20:27,688
You. You don't go anywhere.

134
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:30,813
I got plans for you.

135
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:08,312
Jack Crow.

136
00:22:37,821 --> 00:22:40,025
Quick! The pickup.
Keys!

137
00:22:42,321 --> 00:22:44,358
Come on! Come with me!

138
00:22:46,364 --> 00:22:47,773
Did he bite you?

139
00:22:48,655 --> 00:22:49,484
Wait!

140
00:22:49,697 --> 00:22:51,273
I'll use you. Come here.

141
00:22:53,447 --> 00:22:55,153
Leave her!
She's dead anyway!

142
00:22:55,405 --> 00:22:58,154
Just take her.
I can use her. Go!

143
00:23:06,238 --> 00:23:08,194
Step on it, goddamn it!

144
00:23:12,448 --> 00:23:13,727
- Hit it!
- I'm going!

145
00:23:22,197 --> 00:23:23,524
He's right behind us!

146
00:23:23,738 --> 00:23:25,065
Come on! Go!

147
00:23:33,822 --> 00:23:34,853
Kill him!

148
00:24:42,491 --> 00:24:43,984
You okay?

149
00:24:52,325 --> 00:24:53,154
Can you walk?

150
00:24:54,158 --> 00:24:55,864
You alive? Come on!

151
00:24:56,991 --> 00:24:58,153
Come on.

152
00:24:59,075 --> 00:25:01,646
- What are you doing?
- She's going with us.

153
00:25:03,242 --> 00:25:04,320
He just bit her!

154
00:25:04,576 --> 00:25:06,116
She hasn't turned yet.

155
00:25:06,367 --> 00:25:07,777
Well, she's on her way!

156
00:25:08,117 --> 00:25:10,902
It's under 48 hours.
The telepathic link won't hold.

157
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:12,107
So what!

158
00:25:12,367 --> 00:25:15,484
She'll start receiving his thoughts,
seeing what he sees!

159
00:25:15,742 --> 00:25:17,946
Exactly.
Like a surveillance camera.

160
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,902
So we can find him and
shove a stick up his ass!

161
00:25:21,159 --> 00:25:24,988
I'm gonna use her to get to the master
and whoever tipped him off.

162
00:25:25,243 --> 00:25:28,027
We were set up.
He knew my fucking name!

163
00:25:28,243 --> 00:25:29,819
- Come on.
- Who set us up?

164
00:25:30,076 --> 00:25:32,778
I don't know,
but I want the son of a bitch.

165
00:25:32,993 --> 00:25:34,023
Can you walk?

166
00:25:34,285 --> 00:25:36,903
Wake up! Can you walk?
Are you with me?

167
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:39,237
Come on!

168
00:25:39,451 --> 00:25:41,406
Do you hear me? Well?

169
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:45,156
This ain't my first time
to the dance. Let's go.

170
00:27:35,204 --> 00:27:36,697
Hey, cowboy!

171
00:27:38,621 --> 00:27:39,485
Can I help you?

172
00:27:39,705 --> 00:27:41,032
I'm borrowing your car.

173
00:27:43,747 --> 00:27:44,944
Say, "Help yourself".

174
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:47,782
- You want me to say what?
- Shut the fuck up!

175
00:27:48,038 --> 00:27:50,243
I'll blow your teeth
out of your head.

176
00:27:50,455 --> 00:27:51,912
Back off!

177
00:27:52,538 --> 00:27:53,616
Help yourself, boy.

178
00:27:53,872 --> 00:27:55,992
Much obliged, partner.

179
00:28:10,331 --> 00:28:11,574
Get in!

180
00:28:52,081 --> 00:28:55,032
Take her to Apache Springs.
Plaza Hotel.

181
00:28:55,248 --> 00:28:57,369
Hole up there.
I'll find you soon.

182
00:28:58,331 --> 00:29:01,614
- Dump this thing. Take the Jeep.
- You can't bury them all.

183
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:03,570
Get going.

184
00:29:03,831 --> 00:29:05,407
I need to talk to you!

185
00:29:05,665 --> 00:29:07,074
We're wasting time!

186
00:29:07,415 --> 00:29:08,824
Rule number seven:

187
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:11,324
Never bury a member
by yourself.

188
00:29:11,582 --> 00:29:12,992
Special circumstances.

189
00:29:13,624 --> 00:29:15,033
The team's slaughtered!

190
00:29:15,291 --> 00:29:18,324
- I can handle it!
- Bullshit! You know better.

191
00:29:22,499 --> 00:29:23,577
Got any bright ideas?

192
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:27,535
We kill the whore, bury the team
and head back to Monterey.

193
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,530
If you wanna pull out...

194
00:29:36,791 --> 00:29:38,699
...go ahead.
- I didn't say that.

195
00:29:38,958 --> 00:29:42,039
The rules changed.
We'll do whatever it takes.

196
00:29:42,291 --> 00:29:44,329
We got 11 hours
until sundown.

197
00:29:44,583 --> 00:29:47,367
If you got something to say,
spit it out!

198
00:29:47,625 --> 00:29:51,037
I got something to say.
Don't take too fucking long!

199
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:56,282
I get nervous
when you're not around.

200
00:33:31,172 --> 00:33:34,205
- How you doing? I need a room.
- For how long?

201
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:36,040
A few days.

202
00:33:36,297 --> 00:33:39,248
It's $375 a week.

203
00:33:39,714 --> 00:33:42,499
Plus $25 for your cable TV.

204
00:33:46,798 --> 00:33:50,164
- What's the fucking total, guy?
- That's $400.

205
00:33:50,423 --> 00:33:52,046
Is that your girlfriend?

206
00:33:52,298 --> 00:33:54,833
No, it's my fucking mother.
Give me the key.

207
00:34:03,882 --> 00:34:06,501
Come on. Take my arm.

208
00:34:13,882 --> 00:34:16,714
Hey, wake up, will you?
Let's go!

209
00:34:18,049 --> 00:34:18,878
Jack Crow.

210
00:34:19,674 --> 00:34:23,454
Cerritos at 14th and Santa Fe.
Need immediate pickup.

211
00:34:24,674 --> 00:34:26,298
None of them.

212
00:34:27,091 --> 00:34:28,584
I'm alone.

213
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,079
Dead.

214
00:34:32,425 --> 00:34:36,086
Sources report that
all the bodies were decapitated.

215
00:34:36,675 --> 00:34:40,620
The heads were found buried
a mile from the murder scene.

216
00:34:40,883 --> 00:34:43,288
The number of dead now stands at 19...

217
00:34:43,549 --> 00:34:45,587
...with police still combing the motel.

218
00:34:45,841 --> 00:34:49,966
Of course, we'll be standing by
to bring you any updates.

219
00:35:40,051 --> 00:35:41,081
Forget it.

220
00:35:49,301 --> 00:35:50,580
Buon giorno.

221
00:35:50,884 --> 00:35:53,633
Come. Please sit down.

222
00:35:59,093 --> 00:36:00,041
Who's this?

223
00:36:00,302 --> 00:36:01,332
This is...

224
00:36:01,593 --> 00:36:03,584
...Father Adam Guiteau.

225
00:36:04,010 --> 00:36:07,376
Father Adam's in charge
of our archives.

226
00:36:07,635 --> 00:36:09,425
A bookworm.

227
00:36:09,843 --> 00:36:12,249
He's familiar with all
your activities.

228
00:36:12,593 --> 00:36:14,252
So speak freely.

229
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:16,915
Tell me what happened.

230
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:20,878
We cleaned out the nest.

231
00:36:21,969 --> 00:36:23,427
A master showed up.

232
00:36:23,761 --> 00:36:27,375
No master was ever like this.
Superhuman strength. Unkillable.

233
00:36:28,261 --> 00:36:31,591
We didn't stand a chance.
So tell me, cardinal...

234
00:36:31,844 --> 00:36:33,586
...but couldn't he be the one?

235
00:36:33,844 --> 00:36:36,214
The one we knew would
come along one day?

236
00:36:36,469 --> 00:36:38,376
There are some other developments.

237
00:36:38,636 --> 00:36:41,302
Sad developments.

238
00:36:42,012 --> 00:36:43,386
Tom.

239
00:36:44,428 --> 00:36:48,374
Our Tom. Our Tom Callahan.
He's dead.

240
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:53,132
And the whole European team
is wiped out.

241
00:36:53,345 --> 00:36:54,174
When?

242
00:36:54,428 --> 00:36:55,458
Three days ago.

243
00:36:55,678 --> 00:36:58,546
Callahan was clearing
a nest near Cologne, Germany.

244
00:36:59,303 --> 00:37:02,751
Local authorities reported it
as a terrorist act.

245
00:37:06,054 --> 00:37:07,712
We found this at the site.

246
00:37:13,012 --> 00:37:15,086
Is he the one?

247
00:37:17,054 --> 00:37:18,298
Yes.

248
00:37:22,387 --> 00:37:23,631
What is this?

249
00:37:24,221 --> 00:37:25,299
A celebratum.

250
00:37:25,554 --> 00:37:29,051
It's medieval Latin for "celebrate".
"Celebrate this".

251
00:37:29,305 --> 00:37:31,130
Celebrate what?

252
00:37:33,597 --> 00:37:34,675
We don't know.

253
00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:37,679
I've authenticated it.
It was painted in 1340.

254
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:40,216
The subject's name is- was- Valek.

255
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:43,712
Jan Valek, born in Prague, 1311.
He was a priest...

256
00:37:43,971 --> 00:37:46,756
...who turned against the Church
and led peasants...

257
00:37:46,971 --> 00:37:49,675
...in an uprising,
capturing several towns.

258
00:37:49,931 --> 00:37:51,210
Valek was captured.

259
00:37:51,472 --> 00:37:54,139
He was tried for heresy
and burned at the stake.

260
00:37:54,931 --> 00:37:58,711
But after his death
he was seen walking at night.

261
00:37:58,972 --> 00:38:01,342
He killed the living
to drink their blood.

262
00:38:01,597 --> 00:38:04,630
They opened his grave,
and it was found empty.

263
00:38:04,888 --> 00:38:07,507
It's the first known case
of vampirism.

264
00:38:07,763 --> 00:38:09,256
A priest.

265
00:38:09,513 --> 00:38:13,673
Valek is not like the other masters
you've hunted. He is the first...

266
00:38:13,889 --> 00:38:15,050
...and most powerful.

267
00:38:15,264 --> 00:38:19,044
Of our slayers, you are
the only one who faced Valek...

268
00:38:19,305 --> 00:38:21,711
...and survived.

269
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:23,971
I'm going back out.

270
00:38:24,264 --> 00:38:26,089
You mind if I hang on to this?

271
00:38:26,347 --> 00:38:29,843
I've been in contact with Rome.
The Vatican Council...

272
00:38:30,097 --> 00:38:32,929
...requests that you rebuild
your team.

273
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:36,132
- There isn't time.
- You're to return to Monterey...

274
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:38,427
...recruit new team members...

275
00:38:38,681 --> 00:38:41,300
...and try again when
you are at full strength.

276
00:38:41,973 --> 00:38:45,339
Father Adam will accompany you
and take the place...

277
00:38:45,556 --> 00:38:47,961
...of poor Father Giovanni.

278
00:38:48,348 --> 00:38:49,841
I don't think so.

279
00:38:55,223 --> 00:38:56,799
This is nonnegotiable.

280
00:38:57,056 --> 00:39:00,304
Valek is the original.
The source of the disease.

281
00:39:00,557 --> 00:39:03,046
The first vampire created
by the Church-

282
00:39:03,265 --> 00:39:06,263
- By accident.
- Shut the fuck up!

283
00:39:06,474 --> 00:39:09,341
This was your fight, cardinal.
Now it is mine.

284
00:39:15,724 --> 00:39:20,181
If you refuse to obey the rules,
the operation will be canceled...

285
00:39:20,433 --> 00:39:22,388
...the funding withdrawn.

286
00:39:24,683 --> 00:39:29,056
You have any idea how
this Valek knows my name?

287
00:39:41,391 --> 00:39:42,719
Stay close to him.

288
00:40:50,017 --> 00:40:51,511
What's your name?

289
00:40:54,393 --> 00:40:56,716
Do you understand
what's happened to you?

290
00:40:58,643 --> 00:41:00,468
Help me!

291
00:41:01,977 --> 00:41:03,766
Don't fuck with me, honey!

292
00:41:04,018 --> 00:41:06,933
I'll snap your neck like a twig!

293
00:41:08,268 --> 00:41:10,638
Now nod your head yes or no.

294
00:41:10,935 --> 00:41:13,804
Do you understand
what's happened to you?

295
00:41:14,394 --> 00:41:15,673
Do it!

296
00:41:17,811 --> 00:41:19,055
All right.

297
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:21,723
Now I'm going to explain it to you.

298
00:41:23,061 --> 00:41:26,142
First, I'm gonna take
my hand off your mouth.

299
00:41:26,394 --> 00:41:28,184
You scream...

300
00:41:31,936 --> 00:41:33,179
Good.

301
00:41:39,478 --> 00:41:41,220
What's your name?

302
00:41:42,812 --> 00:41:44,553
Katrina.

303
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:46,809
Okay, Katrina.

304
00:41:47,103 --> 00:41:48,928
Here's the score.

305
00:41:56,186 --> 00:41:58,758
I took off your clothes.
I cleaned you up.

306
00:41:59,021 --> 00:42:01,770
I tied you down.
I also saved your ass.

307
00:42:02,271 --> 00:42:06,644
You've been bitten by a vampire.
Remember the party at the motel?

308
00:42:07,229 --> 00:42:10,559
Big guy, pointy teeth.
Really shitty breath.

309
00:42:11,104 --> 00:42:12,513
Don't worry.

310
00:42:12,771 --> 00:42:14,180
It'll come back to you.

311
00:42:15,437 --> 00:42:18,968
A master vampire has a telepathic
link with his victims.

312
00:42:19,437 --> 00:42:21,429
You're gonna help us find him.

313
00:42:21,897 --> 00:42:23,934
While he's sleeping,
we unleash on him.

314
00:42:24,772 --> 00:42:26,643
You're the bait, honey.

315
00:42:27,646 --> 00:42:29,139
Sorry.

316
00:42:39,938 --> 00:42:41,479
I know all about you, Mr. Crow.

317
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:44,349
I know your parents were
bitten by vampires.

318
00:42:44,606 --> 00:42:47,687
You were raised by the Church
as it's master slayer.

319
00:42:49,772 --> 00:42:52,723
The truth is, I didn't want
to be forced on you.

320
00:42:52,981 --> 00:42:56,062
I was supposed to take over when
Father Giovanni retired.

321
00:42:56,272 --> 00:42:57,931
I always dreamed of this.

322
00:42:58,189 --> 00:43:01,221
Ever since I first heard
about you, the slayers.

323
00:43:01,896 --> 00:43:05,143
I want to be part of the team,
just do whatever I could.

324
00:43:05,354 --> 00:43:07,429
For example, if you
wanted to receive...

325
00:43:07,689 --> 00:43:09,395
...the sacrament of confession-?

326
00:43:09,647 --> 00:43:10,761
Fucking priest!

327
00:43:23,605 --> 00:43:24,767
Who set us up?

328
00:43:25,022 --> 00:43:26,598
Was it you? Who set us up?

329
00:43:26,855 --> 00:43:27,850
Who was it?

330
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:30,310
Was it you? Who set us up?

331
00:43:30,690 --> 00:43:32,894
I don't know what you mean!

332
00:43:33,148 --> 00:43:35,815
You don't think I'll
kill you, a priest.

333
00:43:36,065 --> 00:43:38,221
You're seriously misjudging me!

334
00:43:38,481 --> 00:43:40,685
You want to kill me,
you go ahead!

335
00:43:40,939 --> 00:43:43,510
I don't know what you're
talking about!

336
00:43:44,439 --> 00:43:45,813
I don't.

337
00:43:50,814 --> 00:43:52,474
We'll see about that.

338
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:00,019
Where are we going?

339
00:44:02,732 --> 00:44:04,769
You have to tell me, Mr. Crow.

340
00:44:06,815 --> 00:44:08,142
You ever seen a vampire?

341
00:44:09,357 --> 00:44:11,680
First of all,
they're not romantic.

342
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:14,974
They're not a bunch of fags
in rented formalwear...

343
00:44:15,233 --> 00:44:17,899
...seducing everybody with
Euro-trash accents.

344
00:44:18,149 --> 00:44:20,389
Forget what you've seen
in the movies.

345
00:44:20,608 --> 00:44:23,143
They don't turn into bats.
Crosses don't work.

346
00:44:23,399 --> 00:44:27,724
Garlic? Stand there with garlic,
one of them will bend you over...

347
00:44:27,983 --> 00:44:31,348
...and walk up your strata chocolata
while sucking your blood!

348
00:44:31,566 --> 00:44:34,932
All right? And they don't sleep
in taffeta-lined coffins.

349
00:44:35,149 --> 00:44:39,061
You wanna kill one? Drive a
wooden stake through his heart.

350
00:44:40,067 --> 00:44:42,686
Sunlight turns them into
crispy critters.

351
00:44:43,484 --> 00:44:44,763
Got it?

352
00:44:45,109 --> 00:44:46,436
See this map?

353
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:52,478
This map shows all the encounters
in the U.S. as far back as the 1800s.

354
00:44:52,692 --> 00:44:54,564
- I've never seen it.
- No one has.

355
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:57,524
Look at the Southwest.
See the spiral pattern?

356
00:44:57,775 --> 00:45:02,564
Time-sequence the encounters, you get
a logarithmic pattern, ever-widening.

357
00:45:03,193 --> 00:45:06,937
It's a search pattern, Padre.
They're looking for something.

358
00:45:07,651 --> 00:45:08,895
Do you know what it is?

359
00:45:09,151 --> 00:45:12,066
I heard stories
when I was young.

360
00:45:12,734 --> 00:45:14,772
Something about a black cross.

361
00:45:15,151 --> 00:45:17,639
About vampires walking
in the sunlight.

362
00:45:18,984 --> 00:45:20,062
Padre.

363
00:45:21,151 --> 00:45:22,894
Can I ask you something?

364
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:25,434
When I was kicking your ass...

365
00:45:26,235 --> 00:45:27,692
...did that give you wood?

366
00:45:29,734 --> 00:45:32,685
You get a little mahogany
from that ebony?

367
00:45:34,609 --> 00:45:37,358
I'm just fucking with you.
Forget about it.

368
00:45:40,442 --> 00:45:42,895
And what God has given her...

369
00:45:43,109 --> 00:45:47,104
...is that she sees
her guardian angel.

370
00:46:24,152 --> 00:46:26,024
Oh, Jesus!

371
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:40,850
What time is it?

372
00:46:45,153 --> 00:46:46,183
9:10.

373
00:46:56,529 --> 00:46:57,938
You want one?

374
00:46:59,279 --> 00:47:01,021
You gotta eat something.

375
00:47:01,529 --> 00:47:03,235
I can't.

376
00:47:05,904 --> 00:47:07,776
I wouldn't mind a cigarette.

377
00:47:15,030 --> 00:47:16,191
We have to work on this.

378
00:47:16,405 --> 00:47:18,810
The less you eat,
the faster the virus moves.

379
00:47:19,030 --> 00:47:20,108
Virus?

380
00:47:20,988 --> 00:47:24,484
That's what I call it.
Nobody knows what it really is.

381
00:47:24,696 --> 00:47:27,481
Poison, Kool-Aid,
it all does the same thing.

382
00:47:27,696 --> 00:47:29,568
Turns you into a vampire.

383
00:47:39,239 --> 00:47:41,478
What happened to the other girls?

384
00:47:42,781 --> 00:47:44,060
They didn't make it.

385
00:47:44,781 --> 00:47:46,154
I'm sorry.

386
00:47:47,781 --> 00:47:49,771
So you remember now?

387
00:47:51,114 --> 00:47:52,690
Yeah, some.

388
00:47:53,989 --> 00:47:56,902
- Why doesn't anyone know?
- Nobody wants to know.

389
00:47:57,154 --> 00:47:59,774
That's how vampires survive.
They're smart.

390
00:47:59,989 --> 00:48:04,362
They keep their numbers low,
and the world never catches on.

391
00:48:05,655 --> 00:48:06,899
Will I be one?

392
00:48:08,614 --> 00:48:10,818
I don't know for sure.

393
00:48:11,989 --> 00:48:12,901
Probably.

394
00:48:14,447 --> 00:48:18,108
Unless we find him before you turn.

395
00:48:18,697 --> 00:48:20,734
Then, maybe there's a chance.

396
00:48:24,031 --> 00:48:25,310
Here's what we do know.

397
00:48:25,698 --> 00:48:30,402
You're connected to the master vampire.
He's a part of you.

398
00:48:31,031 --> 00:48:32,607
And this link will grow.

399
00:48:33,698 --> 00:48:36,068
You'll never get him out of you.

400
00:48:36,698 --> 00:48:38,937
Not while he still exists.

401
00:48:39,531 --> 00:48:41,438
Then I don't want to live.

402
00:48:43,531 --> 00:48:44,610
You may not.

403
00:49:04,115 --> 00:49:05,524
Can I get dressed now?

404
00:49:07,116 --> 00:49:08,029
Sure.

405
00:49:09,574 --> 00:49:12,063
Could you get me a towel
or something?

406
00:49:12,991 --> 00:49:15,112
It's not like I haven't
seen you naked.

407
00:49:15,366 --> 00:49:16,610
Fuck it!

408
00:49:16,824 --> 00:49:18,732
Easy, easy.
I'll get you a towel.

409
00:49:18,991 --> 00:49:22,273
One towel coming right up.
I won't peek.

410
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:36,864
Nice try. Leave the door open.

411
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:38,776
No way.

412
00:49:39,117 --> 00:49:40,823
A little bit.

413
00:51:10,911 --> 00:51:13,613
- Don't do it!
- Goddamn it, let me go!

414
00:51:14,452 --> 00:51:15,696
Let me go!

415
00:51:17,952 --> 00:51:18,781
Shit!

416
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:22,319
Stop it!

417
00:51:24,828 --> 00:51:25,942
Look what you did!

418
00:51:31,536 --> 00:51:33,574
You fucking bit me!

419
00:51:34,536 --> 00:51:35,910
Are you fucking nuts?

420
00:51:37,870 --> 00:51:39,777
Where are you going?

421
00:51:40,161 --> 00:51:42,531
You bite me, huh?
Get up!

422
00:51:42,745 --> 00:51:45,031
Fucking bite me!

423
00:51:47,787 --> 00:51:49,612
Fucking bitch!

424
00:51:52,579 --> 00:51:53,609
Fuck!

425
00:51:58,287 --> 00:51:59,828
Goddamn it!

426
00:52:18,413 --> 00:52:20,617
Fucking stupid whore.

427
00:52:32,539 --> 00:52:34,162
Where are you?

428
00:52:36,830 --> 00:52:38,110
I'm fine.

429
00:52:38,747 --> 00:52:39,991
Yeah, I'm fine.

430
00:52:40,205 --> 00:52:41,200
Room 312.

431
00:52:41,414 --> 00:52:42,906
I'm coming up.

432
00:52:43,122 --> 00:52:44,579
Stay put.

433
00:52:51,747 --> 00:52:54,579
I'm Father Adam Guiteau.
You're Tony Montoya?

434
00:52:54,830 --> 00:52:56,371
You look different.

435
00:52:56,622 --> 00:52:59,785
I'm an archivist.
I've studied the team extensively.

436
00:53:09,205 --> 00:53:11,575
What's this bruise on her jaw?

437
00:53:13,413 --> 00:53:14,657
I had to hit her.

438
00:53:15,789 --> 00:53:19,570
She tried to kill herself. I had to
pull her off the fire escape.

439
00:53:20,998 --> 00:53:22,905
Then I fell through the window.

440
00:53:26,456 --> 00:53:27,865
That's all?

441
00:53:36,206 --> 00:53:37,284
Why'd you slug her?

442
00:53:37,789 --> 00:53:40,113
I cut my arm on the broken glass.

443
00:53:40,374 --> 00:53:42,281
I was pissed. I don't know.

444
00:53:42,499 --> 00:53:44,785
I fucking slugged her.
Who cares?

445
00:53:49,665 --> 00:53:50,909
That's our new Padre.

446
00:53:51,123 --> 00:53:54,571
We've been ordered to Monterey.
Rebuild the team.

447
00:53:54,832 --> 00:53:56,988
- We're going back to Monterey?
- No.

448
00:53:57,248 --> 00:53:59,571
Callahan's whole team is gone.

449
00:54:00,165 --> 00:54:01,031
Slaughtered.

450
00:54:01,958 --> 00:54:03,450
So it's just us now.

451
00:54:03,708 --> 00:54:04,738
That's right.

452
00:54:05,666 --> 00:54:06,696
Who is she?

453
00:54:07,416 --> 00:54:08,957
Some hooker.

454
00:54:09,374 --> 00:54:12,870
Bitten by Valek.
These vampires are psychically linked.

455
00:54:13,166 --> 00:54:15,405
As soon she hooks into Valek...

456
00:54:16,249 --> 00:54:17,742
...we go look for him.

457
00:54:17,958 --> 00:54:19,616
We have orders to follow.

458
00:54:19,874 --> 00:54:20,952
Fuck you, Padre.

459
00:54:21,208 --> 00:54:22,238
Language!

460
00:54:22,582 --> 00:54:26,115
If you don't follow orders,
I'll have to call Cardinal Alba.

461
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,374
Excuse me.

462
00:54:32,875 --> 00:54:34,249
Language.

463
00:54:37,917 --> 00:54:40,073
We'll chat about language.
Shall we?

464
00:54:40,708 --> 00:54:42,284
See if this syntax works.

465
00:54:42,542 --> 00:54:45,409
You don't make a call,
don't blow your nose...

466
00:54:45,625 --> 00:54:48,873
...don't wipe your ass,
unless I tell you. Okay?

467
00:55:11,627 --> 00:55:13,368
Show me.

468
00:55:26,126 --> 00:55:27,156
Katrina?

469
00:55:27,626 --> 00:55:28,656
Can you hear me?

470
00:55:31,418 --> 00:55:32,247
What is it?

471
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:37,119
There's someone else that you're
connected to in your mind, you know?

472
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:39,827
What're you seeing?

473
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:44,073
I can't.

474
00:55:44,335 --> 00:55:47,451
Yes, you can, honey.
You're with us and safe.

475
00:55:47,835 --> 00:55:50,204
Now, where is he?
What're you seeing?

476
00:55:51,043 --> 00:55:52,500
It's dark.

477
00:55:52,710 --> 00:55:53,990
All right.
Keep trying.

478
00:55:57,461 --> 00:55:58,491
There's a map.

479
00:55:59,461 --> 00:56:01,498
A circle on the map.

480
00:56:06,711 --> 00:56:07,907
We need a location.

481
00:56:08,127 --> 00:56:10,450
- I'm working on it!
- Before she loses him!

482
00:56:10,669 --> 00:56:13,335
- You wanna switch places?
- Just come on!

483
00:56:14,294 --> 00:56:16,665
Katrina, listen very carefully now.

484
00:56:16,878 --> 00:56:19,580
I need to know exactly where you are.

485
00:56:19,836 --> 00:56:22,953
What you're seeing right now.
Details.

486
00:56:32,503 --> 00:56:34,458
He killed a priest!

487
00:56:34,670 --> 00:56:35,700
You're safe!

488
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:38,408
Did she say a priest?
What priest?

489
00:56:40,587 --> 00:56:42,044
Moving now.

490
00:56:42,296 --> 00:56:43,788
Come on.
Stay with it.

491
00:56:44,004 --> 00:56:45,745
There's a sign...

492
00:56:46,004 --> 00:56:49,204
...on a highway that says San Miguel.

493
00:56:49,462 --> 00:56:50,741
San Miguel? San Miguel?

494
00:56:51,004 --> 00:56:52,793
Keep trying! You have to!

495
00:56:53,045 --> 00:56:54,538
I can't!

496
00:56:54,795 --> 00:56:57,165
- Goddamn it!
- Jack, the link's broken.

497
00:56:57,379 --> 00:56:59,204
What priest?
Goddamn it!

498
00:56:59,462 --> 00:57:03,955
I can get a list of churches if
you'll let me call the archdiocese.

499
00:57:04,213 --> 00:57:07,081
Call every church. Find one
where a Padre is missing.

500
00:57:07,338 --> 00:57:09,826
Road trip.
Your job is to watch this girl.

501
00:57:10,088 --> 00:57:11,083
Goddamn it!

502
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:15,250
Hey, what's wrong with you?

503
00:57:17,088 --> 00:57:19,576
I'm just tired, that's all.

504
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:30,120
Is there something
you want to tell me?

505
00:57:33,422 --> 00:57:35,827
Nothing you'd want to listen to, man.

506
00:57:46,422 --> 00:57:51,079
I got the fax from the cardinal.
You're an investigator for the Church?

507
00:57:51,297 --> 00:57:55,160
We're looking into a pattern
of anti-Catholic hate crimes.

508
00:57:56,047 --> 00:57:58,168
- May I?
- It's pretty savage.

509
00:58:07,755 --> 00:58:12,378
- Is any of this blood the old priest's?
- His name is Father Molina.

510
00:58:13,214 --> 00:58:14,458
Sorry.

511
00:58:15,839 --> 00:58:18,328
You get something,
you'll share it, right?

512
00:58:18,589 --> 00:58:21,623
- That's right.
- I'd better not find out different.

513
00:58:21,839 --> 00:58:23,083
You won't.

514
00:58:23,298 --> 00:58:26,047
It looks like this blood's
from Mrs. Fisher.

515
00:58:26,256 --> 00:58:29,088
We won't know until we get
a sample from pathology.

516
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:31,211
Was anything stolen?

517
00:58:31,423 --> 00:58:33,628
- Just Father Molina.
- We found him!

518
00:58:39,257 --> 00:58:40,121
Lord!

519
00:58:55,008 --> 00:58:56,287
I don't get this!

520
00:58:56,549 --> 00:59:01,005
Why come all this way to attack
some old priest and a cleaning lady?

521
00:59:01,216 --> 00:59:03,621
Valek didn't feed on either of them.

522
00:59:03,883 --> 00:59:07,083
Father Molina was a scholar of
early Catholic history-

523
00:59:07,299 --> 00:59:09,752
- What's the point?
- I don't know.

524
00:59:10,007 --> 00:59:12,377
I don't know why Valek killed him.

525
00:59:13,007 --> 00:59:15,496
- What's this?
- The Church doesn't know.

526
00:59:16,382 --> 00:59:19,500
You and the cardinal
are lying sacks of shit!

527
00:59:19,758 --> 00:59:22,507
Come on. Help me.
The hour's getting late!

528
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:27,874
It's a medieval astronomical sign...

529
00:59:29,092 --> 00:59:30,715
...for the sun.

530
01:00:38,426 --> 01:00:41,211
There are seven more with him now.

531
01:00:42,968 --> 01:00:44,793
Powerful.

532
01:00:45,135 --> 01:00:46,924
Are they masters?

533
01:00:47,636 --> 01:00:48,666
Yes.

534
01:01:46,845 --> 01:01:49,678
I like you.
So don't make me hurt you, okay?

535
01:01:49,929 --> 01:01:53,129
Tell me what you know.
I'll buy you a beer and get you laid.

536
01:01:53,595 --> 01:01:56,345
You don't tell me,
I'll start cutting on you.

537
01:01:58,930 --> 01:02:02,342
No, you won't.
You're a righteous man, Mr. Crow.

538
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:06,168
Besides, I serve a higher master.

539
01:02:06,430 --> 01:02:10,719
Secrets are kept to protect
the Church and its followers. Part of-

540
01:02:12,388 --> 01:02:13,845
- Open your mouth.
- What?

541
01:02:14,054 --> 01:02:15,713
Open your mouth.

542
01:02:22,889 --> 01:02:24,512
Give me your hand.

543
01:02:32,014 --> 01:02:34,881
You listen to me, you fuck!

544
01:02:36,389 --> 01:02:38,462
My father kept a secret once.

545
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:41,134
He'd been bitten by a vampire.

546
01:02:41,806 --> 01:02:44,508
He kept it a secret from me
and my mother.

547
01:02:44,764 --> 01:02:47,217
By the fifth day, he was turning.

548
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:49,883
That night, he attacked my mother.

549
01:02:50,388 --> 01:02:52,842
And then he came after me.

550
01:02:53,097 --> 01:02:56,260
I killed my own father, Padre.

551
01:02:56,513 --> 01:02:58,634
I got no trouble killing you.

552
01:03:00,597 --> 01:03:02,173
Last chance.

553
01:03:04,348 --> 01:03:05,591
Now open your mouth.

554
01:03:05,806 --> 01:03:08,211
Open your fucking mouth!

555
01:03:08,514 --> 01:03:09,676
Then prepare to-

556
01:03:09,889 --> 01:03:11,631
What? You ready?
Excuse me?

557
01:03:11,848 --> 01:03:15,888
Valek is looking for an ancient relic.
The Cross of Berziers.

558
01:03:23,431 --> 01:03:26,548
After his trial, the Church
declared Valek possessed.

559
01:03:26,765 --> 01:03:29,846
He was taken to a town
in France called Berziers.

560
01:03:30,390 --> 01:03:33,672
An exorcism was performed
using an ancient...

561
01:03:33,932 --> 01:03:36,764
...forbidden form of the ceremony.

562
01:03:37,348 --> 01:03:40,097
It was long and very brutal.

563
01:03:41,223 --> 01:03:42,764
Something went wrong.

564
01:03:53,641 --> 01:03:55,382
The wooden gate is opening.

565
01:04:00,849 --> 01:04:05,139
The accounts are confused,
but they refer to an inverse exorcism.

566
01:04:05,807 --> 01:04:09,469
The body is destroyed,
but the possessed soul remains.

567
01:04:09,682 --> 01:04:12,136
Valek was transformed
into a creature...

568
01:04:12,392 --> 01:04:14,678
...whose body is dead but lives on.

569
01:04:14,892 --> 01:04:15,721
A vampire.

570
01:04:16,267 --> 01:04:17,463
A vampire.

571
01:05:05,935 --> 01:05:07,309
It's a cross.

572
01:05:21,310 --> 01:05:24,261
The stories about
the Black Cross are true.

573
01:05:24,518 --> 01:05:27,220
It was used in the exorcism
and taken to Rome.

574
01:05:27,476 --> 01:05:30,558
It's known as the Berziers Cross.

575
01:05:31,435 --> 01:05:33,425
It was shipped to the New World.

576
01:05:33,643 --> 01:05:36,641
It was moved from
one Spanish mission to another.

577
01:05:36,893 --> 01:05:39,807
Its location was kept secret,
even from the Vatican.

578
01:05:40,060 --> 01:05:43,757
For hundreds of years it was lost.
Cardinal Alba found the name...

579
01:05:43,977 --> 01:05:47,177
...of the only living priest
who knew the location.

580
01:05:48,769 --> 01:05:50,143
Father Joseph Molina.

581
01:05:51,019 --> 01:05:54,467
Cardinal Alba and I came to the U.S.
to find Father Molina.

582
01:05:54,727 --> 01:05:57,844
To reclaim the Berziers Cross.
And that is all I know.

583
01:06:09,561 --> 01:06:11,552
You're a good man, Padre.

584
01:06:11,770 --> 01:06:13,428
Welcome to the team.

585
01:06:18,269 --> 01:06:20,094
God forgive me.

586
01:06:30,854 --> 01:06:32,263
He found it.

587
01:06:35,770 --> 01:06:36,967
Let's hit it.

588
01:06:42,895 --> 01:06:44,803
Wait! Wait, stop the car!

589
01:06:51,813 --> 01:06:52,642
That way.

590
01:08:02,356 --> 01:08:03,386
It was here.

591
01:08:22,148 --> 01:08:23,855
You picking up anything?

592
01:08:24,690 --> 01:08:25,519
He's gone.

593
01:08:26,815 --> 01:08:29,303
- You don't look good.
- She hasn't turned yet.

594
01:08:29,523 --> 01:08:32,971
- She can't eat.
- Maybe what she wants is human blood?

595
01:08:33,232 --> 01:08:35,720
- She hasn't turned-
- I heard what you said.

596
01:08:41,941 --> 01:08:43,848
Why don't you back off?

597
01:08:44,357 --> 01:08:47,190
- What's with you?
- What's with me? What's with you?

598
01:08:47,399 --> 01:08:48,892
You're being an asshole.

599
01:08:49,149 --> 01:08:51,353
What the fuck is your problem?

600
01:08:52,232 --> 01:08:54,519
You're not falling for
this half-dead-

601
01:08:54,774 --> 01:08:56,148
Fuck!

602
01:08:59,149 --> 01:09:00,476
Nice shot.
Wanna try again?

603
01:09:00,691 --> 01:09:03,261
- Stop it!
- Get the fuck out of here!

604
01:09:03,524 --> 01:09:04,354
What're you doing?

605
01:09:04,608 --> 01:09:07,393
We're about to have
one fuck of a fight!

606
01:09:08,483 --> 01:09:11,150
Do you know why Valek
wants the cross?

607
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:13,106
Think about it for a minute!

608
01:09:13,358 --> 01:09:16,273
I think Valek wants to finish
his transformation.

609
01:09:16,483 --> 01:09:17,810
The exorcism wasn't completed.

610
01:09:18,066 --> 01:09:21,148
Valek's vulnerable,
able to survive only at night.

611
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:23,853
So if he completes the ritual?

612
01:09:24,108 --> 01:09:27,391
I think the balance shifts.

613
01:09:28,442 --> 01:09:32,899
For 600 years, Valek has wanted to find
a way to live in the daylight.

614
01:09:33,109 --> 01:09:34,139
Fuck me.

615
01:09:34,359 --> 01:09:36,930
Now with the Berziers Cross, he will.

616
01:09:37,192 --> 01:09:41,517
A master vampire able to
walk in the sun. Unstoppable.

617
01:09:41,734 --> 01:09:43,855
Unless we stop him.

618
01:09:45,984 --> 01:09:48,852
We'll have to finish this
some other time.

619
01:09:49,359 --> 01:09:53,851
We got eight hours of sun left.
Come on. Come on.

620
01:09:57,776 --> 01:09:59,269
Come on, baby.

621
01:10:04,235 --> 01:10:06,688
That's where he is.

622
01:10:07,693 --> 01:10:09,483
Santiago.

623
01:10:35,194 --> 01:10:36,983
Place looks empty.

624
01:10:42,444 --> 01:10:43,853
He's near.

625
01:12:20,197 --> 01:12:22,946
What do you figure
the population is? 20?

626
01:12:23,113 --> 01:12:27,237
I'd say 30, maybe more.
The question is, how many are goons?

627
01:12:27,447 --> 01:12:29,817
Our worst-case scenario, half.

628
01:12:30,073 --> 01:12:31,400
15 dead, 15 goons.

629
01:12:31,656 --> 01:12:34,275
Valek would have been here
several days?

630
01:12:34,489 --> 01:12:35,982
That's right, Padre.

631
01:12:36,198 --> 01:12:39,148
He set this up. Slowly.
One goon at a time.

632
01:12:39,405 --> 01:12:43,315
He's got the cross and the biggest nest
the world's ever known.

633
01:12:43,530 --> 01:12:45,521
What do we got? Three slayers.

634
01:12:45,738 --> 01:12:47,195
Two slayers.

635
01:12:49,988 --> 01:12:52,394
It's time to kill some vampires.

636
01:12:52,781 --> 01:12:54,487
You with us, Padre?

637
01:12:56,781 --> 01:12:58,439
Yeah, I'm with you.

638
01:12:59,156 --> 01:13:00,945
Their location.

639
01:13:09,739 --> 01:13:11,564
Where is he?

640
01:13:21,032 --> 01:13:22,690
Everywhere.

641
01:13:24,948 --> 01:13:26,773
Katrina, baby, listen.

642
01:13:27,906 --> 01:13:29,280
Is he in there?

643
01:13:29,531 --> 01:13:30,905
Yes.

644
01:13:32,031 --> 01:13:33,856
He's in there.

645
01:13:34,698 --> 01:13:36,571
In the dark.

646
01:13:37,241 --> 01:13:38,864
Great. Good girl.

647
01:13:41,657 --> 01:13:44,525
And the best constructed
building in town is?

648
01:13:44,741 --> 01:13:45,854
The jail, of course.

649
01:13:46,116 --> 01:13:47,277
Bingo.

650
01:13:47,491 --> 01:13:48,734
She senses him in there.

651
01:13:48,991 --> 01:13:50,946
You think she's telling the truth?

652
01:13:51,157 --> 01:13:53,313
Suppose he's taking control of her?

653
01:13:53,574 --> 01:13:55,778
Then I guess I'll pay with my life.

654
01:13:56,032 --> 01:13:58,237
You're not the only one, amigo.

655
01:13:58,700 --> 01:14:00,525
You're not the only one.

656
01:14:31,284 --> 01:14:32,196
Can you hear me?

657
01:14:38,659 --> 01:14:39,938
I'm sorry.

658
01:14:40,950 --> 01:14:42,112
It'll be all right.

659
01:14:43,285 --> 01:14:44,991
I'll take care of you.

660
01:14:50,660 --> 01:14:52,200
I promise.

661
01:16:11,619 --> 01:16:12,733
It's thirsty.

662
01:16:13,411 --> 01:16:15,154
Think she smells your blood.

663
01:16:19,245 --> 01:16:20,323
I got it! I got it!

664
01:16:23,912 --> 01:16:25,405
Take the woman, Montoya!

665
01:16:33,745 --> 01:16:36,032
Cocksucker! Come on!
Come on!

666
01:16:39,038 --> 01:16:40,317
Help!

667
01:16:42,579 --> 01:16:43,492
Padre, kill it!

668
01:16:43,954 --> 01:16:45,032
Kill it, damn it!

669
01:16:47,038 --> 01:16:49,491
Don't just sit there, kill it!

670
01:16:54,538 --> 01:16:55,734
With the stake!

671
01:16:55,996 --> 01:16:58,663
Kill him with the stake!
Through the heart!

672
01:17:07,663 --> 01:17:10,117
How do you like your stake, bitch?!

673
01:17:53,206 --> 01:17:56,239
- Is there another way up?
- It doesn't look that way.

674
01:17:56,456 --> 01:17:59,370
We have to make them
come out of the elevator.

675
01:17:59,581 --> 01:18:02,993
- That means using the cable.
- We'll attach it to the Jeep.

676
01:18:03,206 --> 01:18:04,947
Yank them right out into the sun.

677
01:18:05,164 --> 01:18:07,156
Someone has to drive the Jeep.

678
01:18:07,373 --> 01:18:11,153
- How will you lure them in?
- Somebody's gotta be inside.

679
01:18:11,582 --> 01:18:13,240
Escape hatch, huh?

680
01:18:14,873 --> 01:18:17,657
When they get in,
one of us goes through the hole.

681
01:18:17,873 --> 01:18:20,113
The other guy presses
the control button.

682
01:18:20,331 --> 01:18:22,488
The doors shut. They get trapped.

683
01:18:22,706 --> 01:18:24,697
- But it has to be me.
- What?

684
01:18:24,915 --> 01:18:28,031
You have to be up here
to fire the crossbow.

685
01:18:29,457 --> 01:18:33,036
- You wanna drive? I'll do it.
- I can't drive. I never learned.

686
01:18:34,166 --> 01:18:35,493
Okay, Padre.

687
01:18:35,749 --> 01:18:38,866
Light her up and shave your ass.
You're the bait.

688
01:18:52,250 --> 01:18:54,075
Katrina, listen to me!

689
01:18:55,208 --> 01:18:58,241
You've gotta try to hold on. Okay?

690
01:19:02,291 --> 01:19:03,867
- You seen Valek?
- Not yet.

691
01:19:04,083 --> 01:19:05,540
Anything?

692
01:19:06,833 --> 01:19:07,662
There.

693
01:19:11,083 --> 01:19:11,948
And there.

694
01:19:16,126 --> 01:19:17,618
Okay, I'm ready.

695
01:19:18,542 --> 01:19:20,995
- You gotta be fleet of foot.
- I know.

696
01:19:21,209 --> 01:19:23,081
- I'm not kidding.
- I know.

697
01:19:23,501 --> 01:19:25,159
I used to play soccer.

698
01:19:25,417 --> 01:19:28,285
- Soccer?
- I was captain of my team.

699
01:19:28,542 --> 01:19:31,457
- I'd better be the one in-
- No, I'll be fine.

700
01:19:31,667 --> 01:19:33,290
- You will?
- Don't worry.

701
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:37,198
- Just shoot when the door opens.
- You can count on that.

702
01:19:40,751 --> 01:19:42,825
- Padre-
- I know.

703
01:19:48,543 --> 01:19:51,292
- He's on his way.
- Hooked and ready.

704
01:20:43,418 --> 01:20:44,699
What're you doing?

705
01:20:51,461 --> 01:20:53,333
Get back in the elevator!

706
01:21:05,253 --> 01:21:06,082
Shit!

707
01:21:09,462 --> 01:21:12,294
Get ready, Montoya.
Here we go.

708
01:22:07,213 --> 01:22:08,042
Open!

709
01:22:14,713 --> 01:22:16,088
Montoya, now!

710
01:22:16,339 --> 01:22:18,626
Sayonara, motherfucker!

711
01:22:18,839 --> 01:22:19,668
Pull!

712
01:22:43,506 --> 01:22:44,619
Padre, you okay?

713
01:22:44,881 --> 01:22:48,044
Did it bite you or scratch you?
Okay, come on.

714
01:22:51,006 --> 01:22:53,375
No! Keep the doors-
Shit!

715
01:22:53,631 --> 01:22:55,123
Sorry.

716
01:22:58,130 --> 01:22:59,920
It's going all the way down.

717
01:23:00,923 --> 01:23:03,044
I'm bringing it up.

718
01:23:03,298 --> 01:23:05,703
- Sorry about the doors.
- No harm, no foul.

719
01:23:08,673 --> 01:23:10,794
- You did good.
- I have to do it again.

720
01:23:11,048 --> 01:23:12,043
We're out of time!

721
01:23:18,006 --> 01:23:20,412
Why aren't the doors open?
What's wrong?

722
01:23:26,966 --> 01:23:28,542
You should look at this!

723
01:23:52,758 --> 01:23:53,788
Shit!

724
01:23:54,050 --> 01:23:55,673
Goddamn it!

725
01:24:00,508 --> 01:24:01,337
Montoya!

726
01:24:01,591 --> 01:24:02,753
Go! Go!

727
01:24:11,425 --> 01:24:13,582
Montoya, go! Go!

728
01:24:25,759 --> 01:24:26,920
- Come on!
- Go!

729
01:24:31,218 --> 01:24:32,462
Shit!

730
01:24:35,593 --> 01:24:39,005
- You never said they could do that.
- I didn't know.

731
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:40,754
Get out of the way!

732
01:24:46,468 --> 01:24:48,921
Let's do it, you bloodsucking bitch!

733
01:24:51,676 --> 01:24:53,134
Montoya! Hook it up!

734
01:24:53,385 --> 01:24:54,547
Padre, get a spike!

735
01:24:57,594 --> 01:24:59,252
She can't take you with her!

736
01:24:59,510 --> 01:25:01,666
Here comes the sun! Come on!

737
01:25:07,384 --> 01:25:08,414
Jack!

738
01:25:09,426 --> 01:25:10,705
Die!

739
01:25:13,593 --> 01:25:15,833
Die, you fucker, die!

740
01:25:18,260 --> 01:25:20,085
Die, you miserable...

741
01:25:36,968 --> 01:25:38,545
Look at the sun!

742
01:25:40,136 --> 01:25:41,250
We're finished.

743
01:25:41,928 --> 01:25:43,468
No, we gotta go back.

744
01:25:43,719 --> 01:25:45,378
Rule number 10, Jack:

745
01:25:46,344 --> 01:25:48,335
You can't kill a master at night.

746
01:25:49,636 --> 01:25:51,045
It's over.

747
01:25:53,553 --> 01:25:54,962
He's right, Padre.

748
01:25:55,219 --> 01:25:56,676
Let's go.

749
01:26:20,845 --> 01:26:22,124
Hello, Jack.

750
01:26:37,804 --> 01:26:39,427
Motherfucker!

751
01:27:03,805 --> 01:27:06,293
Your war's over, crusader.

752
01:28:47,308 --> 01:28:49,180
Hello, Jack.

753
01:28:53,350 --> 01:28:55,008
From your expression...

754
01:28:55,266 --> 01:28:58,430
...I assume you can't
understand my presence here.

755
01:28:58,683 --> 01:29:02,547
I'm sorry to disillusion you.

756
01:29:02,809 --> 01:29:04,846
As one grows old...

757
01:29:05,100 --> 01:29:07,719
...as death approaches...

758
01:29:07,934 --> 01:29:10,138
...we begin to question...

759
01:29:10,392 --> 01:29:12,050
...our faith.

760
01:29:12,309 --> 01:29:14,346
And I found mine lacking.

761
01:29:14,559 --> 01:29:17,592
Is there a God? Is there a Heaven?

762
01:29:17,850 --> 01:29:20,137
I can no longer answer this
for certain.

763
01:29:20,392 --> 01:29:23,509
I've witnessed no miracles,
had no visions.

764
01:29:25,101 --> 01:29:28,965
And the prospect of death
terrifies me.

765
01:29:29,226 --> 01:29:33,551
I realized I've only one alternative.

766
01:29:33,809 --> 01:29:37,506
And I made a bargain
with the devil, if you wish.

767
01:29:38,184 --> 01:29:39,760
You are truly...

768
01:29:40,934 --> 01:29:42,593
...a pile of dogshit, cardinal.

769
01:29:42,851 --> 01:29:45,635
Yeah. That's right.

770
01:29:46,351 --> 01:29:50,298
That's correct, Jack.
And I can live with that.

771
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:53,179
After I've given Valek
what he wants...

772
01:29:53,394 --> 01:29:55,052
...he'll fulfill our bargain.

773
01:29:55,644 --> 01:29:58,759
And I will be transformed into
one of his...

774
01:29:59,309 --> 01:30:01,513
...new children.

775
01:30:01,768 --> 01:30:03,805
It's beautiful, isn't it?

776
01:30:04,851 --> 01:30:06,888
Eternal life.

777
01:30:08,142 --> 01:30:10,134
Immortality...

778
01:30:10,685 --> 01:30:12,676
...can change your heart.

779
01:30:16,352 --> 01:30:19,468
Prove you can kick my ass.
Come on. Untie me.

780
01:30:20,977 --> 01:30:24,389
Fucking pole-smoking, fashion victim.
Come on over here.

781
01:30:26,018 --> 01:30:29,680
Five minutes, then you can bite my ass.
Would you like that?

782
01:30:30,227 --> 01:30:31,684
What will silence you?

783
01:30:31,893 --> 01:30:34,383
Come on. Untie me, you prick!

784
01:30:36,269 --> 01:30:38,556
Perhaps this will help.

785
01:30:44,269 --> 01:30:48,559
Apparently, your friend is
one of my children now.

786
01:30:50,936 --> 01:30:53,306
You are alone, crusader.

787
01:31:56,063 --> 01:31:57,769
What do you want from me?

788
01:32:05,439 --> 01:32:07,015
You hate me so, don't you?

789
01:32:08,147 --> 01:32:10,304
But you made me, crusader.

790
01:32:10,564 --> 01:32:12,969
You hate what you've made.
You fear it.

791
01:32:13,231 --> 01:32:15,221
Because it is superior to you.

792
01:32:16,356 --> 01:32:19,519
For 600 years,
I fed on your kind at will.

793
01:32:31,689 --> 01:32:35,220
- Why don't you just kill me?
- Because you're needed.

794
01:32:36,147 --> 01:32:40,223
The ceremony is a reenactment
of the original exorcism.

795
01:32:40,480 --> 01:32:42,934
It requires the blood
of a crusader...

796
01:32:43,147 --> 01:32:46,892
...and his crucifixion
upon a burning cross.

797
01:32:47,147 --> 01:32:49,767
The climax of the ceremony
must coincide...

798
01:32:50,023 --> 01:32:53,140
...with the first rays
of the rising sun.

799
01:32:54,273 --> 01:32:56,063
Sorry, Jack.

800
01:34:27,734 --> 01:34:28,896
Padre!

801
01:34:30,068 --> 01:34:31,975
Now what're you gonna do, Valek?

802
01:34:32,193 --> 01:34:34,183
You got nobody to
complete your ritual.

803
01:34:34,401 --> 01:34:36,273
The sun's starting to rise!

804
01:34:38,651 --> 01:34:41,401
You will finish the ritual.

805
01:34:42,985 --> 01:34:44,015
Try and make me!

806
01:34:44,277 --> 01:34:47,191
That-a-boy, Padre. Fuck with him!
Hey, Valek!

807
01:34:47,444 --> 01:34:48,853
You're shit-out-of-luck.

808
01:34:49,069 --> 01:34:50,348
Give it up.

809
01:35:07,402 --> 01:35:08,515
Finish it.

810
01:35:09,068 --> 01:35:09,814
No.

811
01:35:10,277 --> 01:35:11,141
Finish it!

812
01:35:11,485 --> 01:35:12,515
No!

813
01:35:16,068 --> 01:35:18,557
Come on, Padre!
My nuts are on fire here!

814
01:35:55,903 --> 01:35:58,143
Come on.
Let's get some vampires.

815
01:37:11,989 --> 01:37:13,233
End of the line, Valek!

816
01:37:25,239 --> 01:37:27,692
You still with us, Crow?

817
01:37:30,447 --> 01:37:32,770
I don't burn so good, bloodsucker.

818
01:37:34,905 --> 01:37:36,564
Give me the cross.

819
01:37:36,822 --> 01:37:39,855
This cross?
Let me just ask you one thing.

820
01:37:40,114 --> 01:37:43,148
After 600 years, how's that
dick working? Pretty good?

821
01:37:54,281 --> 01:37:55,857
Suck this!

822
01:38:00,531 --> 01:38:02,154
Die, you fucker! Die!

823
01:38:20,740 --> 01:38:22,944
You can't kill me.

824
01:38:44,074 --> 01:38:46,231
You ugly, bloodsucking fucker!

825
01:38:46,408 --> 01:38:47,237
Die!

826
01:38:56,159 --> 01:38:57,533
Shit!

827
01:39:06,117 --> 01:39:07,112
Jesus!

828
01:39:22,784 --> 01:39:25,190
Listen to me.
It's going to be okay.

829
01:39:25,451 --> 01:39:28,283
I'll be right back. Okay?

830
01:39:39,660 --> 01:39:41,402
Put your head back.

831
01:40:12,410 --> 01:40:13,950
You look like shit.

832
01:40:16,785 --> 01:40:18,361
Where you going?

833
01:40:20,452 --> 01:40:21,282
South.

834
01:40:22,619 --> 01:40:23,567
You love her?

835
01:40:26,744 --> 01:40:29,149
We make the perfect couple, Jack.

836
01:40:29,411 --> 01:40:31,318
You're not leaving!

837
01:40:31,869 --> 01:40:33,148
Back off.

838
01:40:33,577 --> 01:40:34,406
No.

839
01:40:35,119 --> 01:40:36,446
Don't make me come over...

840
01:40:36,702 --> 01:40:38,574
...and beat the shit out of you!

841
01:40:38,827 --> 01:40:39,656
Back off!

842
01:40:39,911 --> 01:40:40,989
He's a vampire!

843
01:40:43,620 --> 01:40:44,449
Rule number one:

844
01:40:45,328 --> 01:40:48,160
If your partner is ever
bitten by a vampire...

845
01:40:49,245 --> 01:40:50,524
...never...

846
01:40:50,786 --> 01:40:52,742
...ever let him live.

847
01:41:01,578 --> 01:41:03,236
I'm not a slayer anymore.

848
01:41:04,496 --> 01:41:05,905
Besides...

849
01:41:06,996 --> 01:41:08,370
...the way I figure...

850
01:41:09,412 --> 01:41:12,695
...you two got plenty to do
cleaning the rest out.

851
01:41:12,954 --> 01:41:16,569
She hides in the van while you
make for the border?

852
01:41:16,829 --> 01:41:18,784
Try to catch it by nightfall?

853
01:41:19,037 --> 01:41:20,660
I need a vacation, Jack.

854
01:41:22,162 --> 01:41:23,619
When did she first bite you?

855
01:41:26,704 --> 01:41:28,577
Two days ago.

856
01:41:29,413 --> 01:41:31,155
I still covered your ass.

857
01:41:32,246 --> 01:41:33,988
Yes, you did.

858
01:41:39,371 --> 01:41:41,445
I would say I owe you two days.

859
01:41:45,996 --> 01:41:46,825
What do you say?

860
01:41:47,580 --> 01:41:48,954
You've got two days.

861
01:42:00,956 --> 01:42:02,199
Wherever you go...

862
01:42:05,955 --> 01:42:07,662
...I will find you.

863
01:42:08,164 --> 01:42:09,822
I will hunt you down...

864
01:42:11,497 --> 01:42:13,039
...and I will kill you.

865
01:42:13,873 --> 01:42:15,449
The girl too.

866
01:42:26,164 --> 01:42:27,704
Vaya con Dios, my friend.

867
01:42:48,039 --> 01:42:50,244
Vaya con Dios, slayer.

868
01:42:57,832 --> 01:43:00,664
Time to slay some vampires, Padre.

869
01:43:00,874 --> 01:43:02,117
You up for it?

870
01:43:02,374 --> 01:43:03,404
I guess so.

871
01:43:03,665 --> 01:43:06,498
- Just the two of us.
- No, Mr. Crow.

872
01:43:06,999 --> 01:43:08,989
He was always with us.

873
01:43:15,332 --> 01:43:17,121
Fair enough, Padre.

874
01:43:18,790 --> 01:43:20,449
Let me ask you a question.

875
01:43:21,583 --> 01:43:24,865
When you were stabbing that vampire,
did you get wood?

876
01:43:25,083 --> 01:43:26,031
Mahogany.

877
01:43:26,249 --> 01:43:27,825
- Excuse me?
- Ebony.

878
01:43:28,041 --> 01:43:29,071
Teak.

879
01:43:29,291 --> 01:43:31,081
Are you possessed by demons?

880
01:43:31,291 --> 01:43:34,408
- A major chubby.
- Language, Padre, language.
