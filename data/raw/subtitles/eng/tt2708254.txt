2
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:08,802
Want to play again?

3
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:13,576
Give you a chance to get
those cigarettes back.

4
00:01:19,144 --> 00:01:21,716
I'm scared, man.

5
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:24,720
Don't got too many
friends on the outside.

6
00:01:24,784 --> 00:01:26,019
Not anymore.

7
00:01:28,153 --> 00:01:30,858
Just keep your eye
on the end game.

8
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:33,629
Everything will fall into place.

9
00:01:35,194 --> 00:01:37,097
I'm going to miss you, chess man.

10
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:42,836
Listen to me, Eugene.

11
00:01:44,737 --> 00:01:48,644
Every day you out there,
you out there for me

12
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:51,179
and every other brother in here

13
00:01:51,243 --> 00:01:52,980
who's never going
to be out there again.

14
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:04,858
I made this for you.

15
00:02:08,828 --> 00:02:10,063
Take care of the king.

16
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:14,001
Everything else follows.

17
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,746
You good?
Yeah.

18
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:47,195
Jamal, I appreciate
you for this, my brother.

19
00:03:47,259 --> 00:03:50,766
Hey, man, I...
I owe you one.

20
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:53,334
Well, since your memory
serves you so well,

21
00:03:53,398 --> 00:03:55,669
think you can help me
find some work?

22
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:57,738
Honest work?

23
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:01,843
Yeah.

24
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:02,989
I think I can do something.

25
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:23,765
There's the
halfway house, my brother.

26
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:24,665
Pull over there.

27
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:44,351
Hey, you need a car?

28
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:46,052
Actually, I'm friends with Jamal.

29
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,221
I'm here about a job.

30
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:50,159
Right. Right. Yeah.

31
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:52,193
Well, we got some spots
in the night shift.

32
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:54,161
What kind of late hours you keep?

33
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:56,707
I keep whatever hours
you need me to keep.

34
00:04:57,462 --> 00:04:59,232
That's a good answer.
That's a good answer.

35
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,405
All right, fill that out.
Great.

36
00:05:02,467 --> 00:05:04,070
When could you start?

37
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,742
Whenever is clever.

38
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,943
A lot of guys who come in
here looking for work,

39
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:10,978
head cases.

40
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:12,279
Ex-cons at best.

41
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:18,557
When did you get out?

42
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:23,383
Sorry.

43
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:32,927
Hello, Eugene.

44
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:34,862
Trini?

45
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:35,795
Is that you, baby?

46
00:06:38,463 --> 00:06:41,368
My goodness, Trini.

47
00:06:41,433 --> 00:06:43,370
Y-You want your usual,
extra chocolate?

48
00:06:43,435 --> 00:06:46,040
No, I can't.
I have class.

49
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:48,108
What are you studying?

50
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:48,909
Pre-law.

51
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:53,281
My daughter's going to be a lawyer.

52
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:58,286
Listen, Trini, I know
it's been a long time, but...

53
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:01,256
I'm-I'm sorry, I just...

54
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,525
I don't have time
for this right now.

55
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:05,960
But I wanted to come
tell you in person.

56
00:07:07,492 --> 00:07:08,493
Marco's locked up.

57
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:15,571
He's been in juvenile detention
for almost a year now.

58
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:19,339
Selling drugs.

59
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:24,545
I really have to go now.

60
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,312
Wait, wait, Trini, please.

61
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:29,051
I really have to go, Eugene.

62
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:29,616
I'm sorry.

63
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:32,018
Take care.

64
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,310
Some things change...

65
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:59,314
other things
stay the same damn way.

66
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,650
I'll be damned.

67
00:08:11,557 --> 00:08:13,426
What's up, buddy?
Been too long, man.

68
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,063
Yes, sir.
I'm out.

69
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,532
You got a place to stay?

70
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:18,532
Halfway house.

71
00:08:22,568 --> 00:08:24,939
I can hook you up with a car.

72
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:27,041
Remember Andre?
Dre?

73
00:08:27,106 --> 00:08:29,578
He's got a Crown Vic just sitting there.
Word?

74
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:30,977
Beat up.

75
00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:33,013
On its last legs.

76
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:36,586
So, no brother really wants
to take that off his hands.

77
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:38,619
Watch this.
I can grab it for you.

78
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:41,321
It'll do you some good.
I appreciate it. Yes, sir.

79
00:08:41,387 --> 00:08:44,326
Thank you, my brother.

80
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:46,460
What I really need is a job,
though.

81
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:48,263
Money is just...

82
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:50,464
cash is tight, man.

83
00:08:50,531 --> 00:08:52,935
Seems like nobody wants
to hire an ex-con.

84
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:54,334
Parole board didn't set you up?

85
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,239
There's a waiting list.

86
00:08:57,303 --> 00:09:00,342
Maybe a couple of weeks at least.

87
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:05,580
Look, man, I do maintenance
over at the Maud Alton school.

88
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:07,846
I can try and put a good word in for you.
Is that right?

89
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,351
Yeah. It's not so bad
if you don't mind

90
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,587
hanging around the kids all day.
Psh.

91
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:14,689
I hung around a lot worse.

92
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:18,327
Can't make any promises now.
Hey, you know me. It's all good.

93
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,259
Okay.

94
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:22,495
What about Perry?

95
00:09:22,563 --> 00:09:24,499
He still hang around?
Oh, yeah.

96
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:26,702
After you went in, he
became the man around here.

97
00:09:26,728 --> 00:09:27,261
Word?

98
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:31,007
Yeah, he's got his hands
in some of everything, man.

99
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,238
Good for him.

100
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:35,143
What?

101
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:36,577
I'm glad you came home, Eugene.

102
00:09:38,177 --> 00:09:39,680
I ain't got nowhere else to go.

103
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:15,617
Ma'am, I'm going
to cut to the chase.

104
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:19,588
I'm a real hard worker.
I'm disciplined. Keep to myself.

105
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:22,691
Well, I, I haven't even given you
a job description yet.

106
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:26,161
Well, whatever it is,
I'll get it done.

107
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:28,429
You know, we've been losing
our funding left and right.

108
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:31,266
So, the pay wouldn't be very good.

109
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:33,434
I understand.

110
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:36,471
How long have you known Billy?

111
00:10:36,536 --> 00:10:38,272
Since I was 14.

112
00:10:38,337 --> 00:10:40,809
Well, he speaks highly of you.

113
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:45,580
Like I said,
the-the pay won't be good

114
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:49,620
and the kids, well
they are a handful.

115
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:52,219
Well, I'm real good with children.

116
00:10:52,284 --> 00:10:54,354
I got two beautiful kids of my own.

117
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,125
I know how to handle
them pretty good.

118
00:10:57,189 --> 00:11:00,194
Well, when would you
be able to start?

119
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:01,260
Yesterday.

120
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:15,577
Well, well, well.

121
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:18,512
My brother, my brother.

122
00:11:18,578 --> 00:11:19,646
Perry.

123
00:11:20,647 --> 00:11:22,116
Look at you.

124
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:23,617
Look at you.

125
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,823
Just living the good life.

126
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:29,823
Hey.

127
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:35,697
So, you're out now.
I'm out.

128
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:38,165
Look, I just wanted to say, okay...

129
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:41,537
Perry, let's let the past
stay in the past, all right?

130
00:11:41,601 --> 00:11:45,274
You're not even going to give me a
chance to say what I was going to say?

131
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:49,746
If you need anything,
anything, okay?

132
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:51,512
A job,

133
00:11:51,578 --> 00:11:53,548
a lady,

134
00:11:53,613 --> 00:11:57,453
I want you to give me a call,
all right?

135
00:11:57,517 --> 00:11:59,888
The way I'm living now,

136
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:05,295
what I got now,

137
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:06,158
I owe you that.

138
00:12:07,728 --> 00:12:12,269
Here's my number.
Don't be afraid to use it.

139
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:16,305
Hey, boys, you're looking
at a living legend.

140
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:18,171
One of the last true soldiers.

141
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:21,542
I used to run behind him.

142
00:12:22,642 --> 00:12:24,444
They don't get it.

143
00:12:24,511 --> 00:12:26,548
They ain't like us, Gene.

144
00:12:26,613 --> 00:12:28,282
They don't appreciate.

145
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:32,453
Hey, I want you to call me,

146
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:33,520
all right?

147
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:35,954
Let's go.

148
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:12,425
What's going on here?

149
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:21,703
What is this?

150
00:13:21,768 --> 00:13:24,840
Why you looking at me?
Why are you even in detention, Cliff?

151
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:27,509
Why do you even bother showing
up here if you don't give a damn

152
00:13:27,574 --> 00:13:30,278
about anything, least of all,
your future at Maud Alton?

153
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:32,446
You're tripping, Ms. Gadbaw.

154
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:34,448
Why do you think
I'm up in here, huh?

155
00:13:34,514 --> 00:13:35,749
These my best customers.

156
00:13:39,586 --> 00:13:41,322
I want you both in Princi...

157
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:45,458
Shh.

158
00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:53,967
Whoops.

159
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:57,236
Yeah.

160
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:01,642
Bye-bye.

161
00:14:06,912 --> 00:14:09,383
Hey, did I tell you I saw Katrina?

162
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:10,818
My baby's going to be a lawyer.

163
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:12,586
Oh, yeah?
Trini?

164
00:14:12,652 --> 00:14:13,687
Yes, sir.

165
00:14:13,753 --> 00:14:15,455
Man.

166
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:16,957
She was always bright, that one.

167
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:18,424
Got that right.

168
00:14:19,659 --> 00:14:20,927
How about Marco?

169
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,042
Excuse me.

170
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:42,784
Now, what exactly happened in here?

171
00:14:42,849 --> 00:14:45,621
What are you talking
about, Ms. King?

172
00:14:45,685 --> 00:14:48,657
I mean, where did Ms. Gadbaw go?

173
00:14:49,349 --> 00:14:51,752
She won't be here for
the rest of the day.

174
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:55,397
Does that mean we get to be out
for the rest of the day, too?

175
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:57,799
No, that doesn't, T.

176
00:14:57,864 --> 00:15:00,636
Now I'm going to find
a replacement monitor.

177
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,371
Each of you will act responsibly

178
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:05,338
while I do so.

179
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:06,472
Is that clear?

180
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:19,921
Ms. King.
Have a good day, now.

181
00:15:25,525 --> 00:15:26,760
Everything all right?

182
00:15:26,826 --> 00:15:29,330
No, actually.

183
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:33,637
Ms. Gadbaw,
the detention monitor...

184
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,037
Mr. Brown, would you mind
doing me a quick favor?

185
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:37,537
It'll only take a minute.

186
00:15:39,673 --> 00:15:42,411
Now. if there are
any problems in here.

187
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:46,816
Mr. Brown will report
them directly to me.

188
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,881
I'm not joking.

189
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:52,824
Thank you so much.
I'll be back with a monitor soon.

190
00:15:52,886 --> 00:15:54,689
It's fine.

191
00:16:09,602 --> 00:16:12,473
Hey, y'all supposed
to be out of your seats?

192
00:16:12,539 --> 00:16:15,845
Hey, man, we just getting up so you can
clean the gum off the bottom of our chairs.

193
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:23,984
I got to go to the bathroom.

194
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:26,420
Not until Ms. King gets back.
She'll be back in a minute.

195
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:27,888
Come on. Please?

196
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:33,025
What's your name, son?

197
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:34,394
I'm Percy Hall.

198
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,698
Yo, sit down, Peanut.

199
00:16:36,763 --> 00:16:37,998
Peanut?

200
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:39,398
Is that what they call you?

201
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:43,605
What you want, girl?
What you want?

202
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,907
Hey. Hey, all right.
That's enough, now.

203
00:16:45,972 --> 00:16:46,907
Come on, y'all.

204
00:16:46,973 --> 00:16:48,442
Have a seat.

205
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:49,743
Sit down.

206
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:56,653
You let me go to the bathroom, I
can make them sit and stay down.

207
00:16:56,716 --> 00:16:58,553
No deal.
Man.

208
00:16:58,618 --> 00:17:01,456
Hey, I'm not going to tell
y'all again, sit down.

209
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:03,591
Yo, relax, man.

210
00:17:03,656 --> 00:17:06,862
Man, we ain't got to listen to no
janitor. You ain't no teacher.

211
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:09,897
Have a seat, son, right now.

212
00:17:09,963 --> 00:17:11,432
Or what?

213
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:12,800
You some kind of tough guy?

214
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:14,468
You want to find out?

215
00:17:16,636 --> 00:17:17,671
Huh?

216
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:31,519
What is he doing?

217
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:36,022
Sit down.

218
00:17:44,998 --> 00:17:47,670
What you nodding
your head for, Peanut?

219
00:17:59,979 --> 00:18:01,515
All right.

220
00:18:13,526 --> 00:18:15,696
Trini.

221
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:18,166
How do you know where I live?
I looked you up.

222
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:20,708
Just because I went to jail
don't mean I can't read.

223
00:18:20,734 --> 00:18:22,229
"Doesn't" mean you can't read.

224
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:24,004
Hey, Trini, Trini.

225
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,238
It's "Katrina."

226
00:18:25,505 --> 00:18:26,172
Sorry.

227
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:27,139
Katrina.

228
00:18:30,043 --> 00:18:31,780
I got a job at your old school.

229
00:18:35,548 --> 00:18:39,522
I know I made mistakes
in the past, a lot of mistakes.

230
00:18:39,586 --> 00:18:42,023
I'm just trying to make
things right, that's all.

231
00:18:42,088 --> 00:18:44,292
I'm just trying to make things
right with you, Katrina.

232
00:18:44,557 --> 00:18:45,892
You're my girl.

233
00:18:50,063 --> 00:18:51,031
Trini.

234
00:18:52,732 --> 00:18:54,702
You're my gir...

235
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:55,768
Trini.

236
00:18:58,872 --> 00:19:01,042
I just want to make
things right for us.

237
00:19:31,804 --> 00:19:32,705
Ms. King.

238
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:34,942
Mr. Brown.

239
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:36,945
Thanks again for the other day.

240
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:39,314
I was...
I was really impressed.

241
00:19:39,579 --> 00:19:41,181
You're welcome.

242
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:44,185
Well, I'm off to a meeting.
Keep up the good work.

243
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:46,654
Oh...

244
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:50,125
about the other day.

245
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:53,296
When is Ms. Gadbaw coming back?

246
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,328
She's not.

247
00:19:55,595 --> 00:19:58,299
Oh, well, what are you going
to do about detention?

248
00:20:13,112 --> 00:20:15,316
What you doing in these parts?

249
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,885
I missed my bus, was late.

250
00:20:17,951 --> 00:20:19,888
I don't plan on making it a habit.

251
00:20:19,953 --> 00:20:22,190
Maybe you should.

252
00:20:22,254 --> 00:20:23,155
I'm here.

253
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,259
Name's Michelle, right?

254
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:27,260
I'm T.

255
00:20:28,661 --> 00:20:30,030
I know who you are.

256
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:38,106
All right, let's go.
Everybody have a seat.

257
00:20:38,171 --> 00:20:39,306
Aw.

258
00:20:40,673 --> 00:20:42,008
Look who it is.

259
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:43,912
You here to clean the blackboards?

260
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:48,751
For those of you who don't remember
me, my name is Eugene Brown.

261
00:20:48,815 --> 00:20:51,286
Does that mean
we can call you "Genie?"

262
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:53,387
That'd be the last thing
you ever call me.

263
00:20:53,653 --> 00:20:54,988
Ooh.

264
00:20:55,054 --> 00:20:56,256
What's that?

265
00:20:56,321 --> 00:20:58,158
This here is a chess board.

266
00:20:58,224 --> 00:21:00,294
Anybody know how to play chess?

267
00:21:02,028 --> 00:21:03,430
Hey, yo.

268
00:21:03,696 --> 00:21:05,365
You think you're pretty smart, huh?

269
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,470
Why don't you come up here
and play me a game, then.

270
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:09,937
You're corny, man.
I ain't playing no games with you.

271
00:21:10,003 --> 00:21:11,271
What's your name, son?

272
00:21:11,336 --> 00:21:13,841
Clifton.
And I ain't your son.

273
00:21:13,906 --> 00:21:15,208
Fair enough, Clifton.

274
00:21:15,275 --> 00:21:17,680
Big bad Clifton.

275
00:21:17,744 --> 00:21:22,452
Well, okay, if you ain't got
the guts to play me, Clifton,

276
00:21:22,715 --> 00:21:24,417
does anybody else?
Anyone?

277
00:21:24,684 --> 00:21:25,451
Yo.

278
00:21:25,718 --> 00:21:26,786
I'll play this.

279
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:30,091
You like cards?

280
00:21:30,156 --> 00:21:31,157
Fine.

281
00:21:31,224 --> 00:21:32,092
We'll play cards.

282
00:21:38,765 --> 00:21:41,804
Here's the deal.
If you win...

283
00:21:41,868 --> 00:21:45,709
the whole class gets to do whatever
they want for the rest of detention.

284
00:21:45,772 --> 00:21:46,439
What?

285
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:53,015
But if I win, you learn a new game.
You hustling me?

286
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:55,403
Hustle? You're the one that
wanted to play cards, homie.

287
00:21:55,429 --> 00:21:56,009
You right.

288
00:21:56,049 --> 00:21:57,886
Go ahead and play
this clown, Peanut.

289
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:59,252
You'll never get beat.

290
00:22:04,157 --> 00:22:06,060
You know the game...

291
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:08,295
find the red ace?

292
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,063
Huh?

293
00:22:10,129 --> 00:22:13,301
My name is Peter Paul.
I come from Montreal.

294
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:15,335
Came to play 'em all.

295
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:20,143
I've broken hipsters and
slicksters, elbows, and a-holes.

296
00:22:20,206 --> 00:22:21,842
Your name is Peter what?

297
00:22:21,908 --> 00:22:23,511
Go ahead and pick the one you like.

298
00:22:23,776 --> 00:22:25,245
Nah-ah-ah.

299
00:22:25,278 --> 00:22:27,482
Bet you're dead, Jack.
Man, I see it.

300
00:22:27,747 --> 00:22:29,082
I see it.

301
00:22:29,148 --> 00:22:30,751
Don't you worry about me seeing it.

302
00:22:35,822 --> 00:22:37,759
See, here's what happened to you.

303
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:40,061
You thought you knew the
truth, but it wasn't there.

304
00:22:40,126 --> 00:22:42,163
And it never will be until
you learn where to look.

305
00:22:42,228 --> 00:22:43,463
He's messing with you, Peanut.

306
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:45,198
Man, I can catch it.

307
00:22:45,264 --> 00:22:46,900
I-I-I was just
screwing around, man.

308
00:22:46,966 --> 00:22:48,068
Let me get one more shot.

309
00:22:48,134 --> 00:22:50,371
One more shot?
Yeah.

310
00:22:52,138 --> 00:22:54,375
My name is Peter Paul.
I come from Montreal.

311
00:22:54,439 --> 00:22:56,276
I came to play 'em all.

312
00:22:58,277 --> 00:23:00,849
Ah-ah-ah.

313
00:23:00,913 --> 00:23:02,448
Make sure you see it.

314
00:23:15,261 --> 00:23:20,104
This is a king.

315
00:23:20,166 --> 00:23:22,236
This is your life.

316
00:23:22,301 --> 00:23:25,407
One mistake and it
can be taken away.

317
00:23:26,873 --> 00:23:27,841
Wha.

318
00:23:42,321 --> 00:23:45,427
Look, man.

319
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:48,563
Yo, this is going
to be the meeting spot.

320
00:23:48,828 --> 00:23:50,230
All you got to do is go in there,

321
00:23:50,296 --> 00:23:51,464
grab the stuff, and be out.

322
00:23:54,066 --> 00:23:55,034
You get the money yet?

323
00:23:58,104 --> 00:24:01,043
No, man, I ain't seen
my uncle in two weeks.

324
00:24:01,107 --> 00:24:03,912
What the hell we going to do, Cliff?
I don't...

325
00:24:03,976 --> 00:24:06,080
Look, man, if I can't
get the money...

326
00:24:08,181 --> 00:24:10,285
Forget it, man.
We're just going to lift it.

327
00:24:14,053 --> 00:24:15,455
My cousin gave it to me.

328
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:21,060
That's fly, right?

329
00:24:22,562 --> 00:24:24,966
You know I don't
roll like that, Cliff.

330
00:24:25,031 --> 00:24:26,066
Well, how do you roll?

331
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,538
You don't see what a good
opportunity this is?

332
00:24:30,603 --> 00:24:32,305
Huh?

333
00:24:32,371 --> 00:24:34,241
You ain't got no job,
you ain't got no money,

334
00:24:34,307 --> 00:24:36,444
you ain't got no opportunity,
your mom's half gone...

335
00:24:36,509 --> 00:24:40,617
Shut up about my mom, man.
Yo, that's the truth, T, and you know it.

336
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,516
Look, man, we pull this job off

337
00:24:42,582 --> 00:24:45,353
and we ain't got to worry
about nothing no more.

338
00:24:46,586 --> 00:24:48,155
Nothing.

339
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,462
Now, you think about that.

340
00:24:59,165 --> 00:25:02,371
Now, everyone on the board is here
for one reason and one reason only.

341
00:25:02,435 --> 00:25:03,938
To protect the king.

342
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:05,071
That is right.

343
00:25:05,137 --> 00:25:06,907
To protect the king.

344
00:25:06,973 --> 00:25:09,410
Now, he is old and has
survived many battles.

345
00:25:09,475 --> 00:25:11,378
So he can only move
one spot at a time.

346
00:25:11,444 --> 00:25:15,986
So, who's got his back
if he can only move one spot?

347
00:25:16,048 --> 00:25:18,018
The queen.

348
00:25:18,084 --> 00:25:21,323
Now, she is smarter faster,
and stronger than her king.

349
00:25:25,658 --> 00:25:28,095
The knight is the horse.

350
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:31,299
Now, he can move two spots forward
and one spot to the side.

351
00:25:33,232 --> 00:25:36,973
The trusty bishop
is his diagonal attack.

352
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:39,407
The rook, he patrols
the entire board.

353
00:25:39,472 --> 00:25:41,342
He can move as many
spaces as he wants,

354
00:25:41,407 --> 00:25:44,246
as long as it's in the same
direction he was moving.

355
00:25:46,479 --> 00:25:48,951
Oh yes, the pawns.

356
00:25:49,015 --> 00:25:50,618
They are the front line.

357
00:25:50,683 --> 00:25:52,385
They will be casualties.

358
00:25:54,954 --> 00:25:57,058
This crap's boring. man.

359
00:25:57,123 --> 00:25:59,026
Kids game.

360
00:25:59,091 --> 00:26:00,226
What you reading?

361
00:26:02,261 --> 00:26:03,530
Let me put it to you this way,

362
00:26:03,596 --> 00:26:06,635
a way you'll understand.

363
00:26:06,699 --> 00:26:08,669
Think about it like this.

364
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:10,336
Who's your supplier?

365
00:26:10,403 --> 00:26:12,273
Hey, you tripping.

366
00:26:12,338 --> 00:26:14,475
Hey, I know you ain't growing
that weed you're selling

367
00:26:14,541 --> 00:26:17,112
and so does everybody else in
here you're trying to sell it to.

368
00:26:17,176 --> 00:26:18,612
So, who's your guy?
Huh?

369
00:26:18,678 --> 00:26:22,418
Your ace in the hole.

370
00:26:22,481 --> 00:26:24,184
Trying to protect your king.
I like that.

371
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:25,720
Okay.
All right.

372
00:26:25,985 --> 00:26:30,761
Well, then let's
call this king, "Perry."

373
00:26:31,023 --> 00:26:33,327
King Perry it is.

374
00:26:33,392 --> 00:26:35,630
Now, King Perry has an army
and you're a part of it.

375
00:26:35,695 --> 00:26:37,565
But the problem is,

376
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:39,767
you think you're out there
doing the king's business,

377
00:26:40,032 --> 00:26:42,570
all you're really doing
is sacrificing yourself.

378
00:26:42,635 --> 00:26:44,104
Like the pawn you truly are.

379
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:45,438
It ain't like that, B.

380
00:26:45,505 --> 00:26:47,709
It's exactly like that, partner.

381
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:50,545
Now, if you want to keep making the
same mistakes for a king who could

382
00:26:50,611 --> 00:26:54,618
care less about your ass, out
there is the board to do it on.

383
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,051
But if you want to learn how
to make the right maneuvers,

384
00:26:57,116 --> 00:26:59,754
this is where you do it.
Right here on this board.

385
00:27:02,421 --> 00:27:04,191
So, what do you want,
what do you want to do?

386
00:27:04,256 --> 00:27:05,792
You want to learn how to play?

387
00:27:06,058 --> 00:27:08,162
Played out, man.

388
00:27:08,227 --> 00:27:09,495
I'll play.
Me, too.

389
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:14,768
There it is.

390
00:27:15,034 --> 00:27:16,169
Very nice.

391
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:26,481
Man, Peanut, that
ain't the right move.

392
00:27:26,546 --> 00:27:28,215
Use the horse, it moves in and out.

393
00:27:30,216 --> 00:27:32,153
Right there.

394
00:27:32,218 --> 00:27:34,121
No, man, right...
What, are you blind, man?

395
00:27:34,186 --> 00:27:37,058
Tahime, why don't you
play your own game?

396
00:27:37,123 --> 00:27:38,593
Man, I'm just watching.

397
00:27:41,127 --> 00:27:42,362
How did you see that attack?

398
00:27:42,428 --> 00:27:44,331
What you mean "see?"

399
00:27:44,397 --> 00:27:46,067
It's obvious.

400
00:27:46,132 --> 00:27:47,467
Peanut's just stupid.

401
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:03,349
Hey. Mr. Brown.

402
00:28:03,416 --> 00:28:04,786
Hey, what you doing?

403
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:06,653
Going to get a ride, man.

404
00:28:06,719 --> 00:28:08,589
Don't ride with that fool.

405
00:28:08,655 --> 00:28:10,257
I'd rather walk.

406
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:15,663
Let's go.

407
00:28:31,844 --> 00:28:33,681
It's right up here.

408
00:28:33,746 --> 00:28:34,346
823.

409
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:38,386
Oh, man.

410
00:28:38,451 --> 00:28:41,256
That's T's mama.

411
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,723
You all live here?

412
00:28:42,788 --> 00:28:46,261
Yeah. T eats
at my place every night.

413
00:28:46,325 --> 00:28:47,594
His mama don't cook.

414
00:28:47,661 --> 00:28:50,332
She's real messed up, man.

415
00:28:50,396 --> 00:28:52,801
Yeah.

416
00:28:52,865 --> 00:28:56,606
Thanks for the ride, Mr. Brown.
Anytime, son.

417
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:58,172
Take care of yourself.

418
00:29:28,234 --> 00:29:29,937
No, no, Marco.
Marco, please.

419
00:29:30,202 --> 00:29:32,205
Please, man.
Have a seat.

420
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:34,676
Come on, man.
Please.

421
00:29:44,785 --> 00:29:45,753
Thank you.

422
00:29:45,818 --> 00:29:47,555
Thank you, son.

423
00:29:50,189 --> 00:29:51,491
Did you get any of my letters?

424
00:29:56,663 --> 00:29:58,800
I've been out
for a couple weeks now.

425
00:30:02,636 --> 00:30:07,311
I've been teaching these kids chess
down in the old neighborhood.

426
00:30:07,373 --> 00:30:09,644
I got this one kid
that reminds me of you.

427
00:30:09,709 --> 00:30:12,714
Who the hell do you think you are?

428
00:30:12,779 --> 00:30:15,584
You never taught me nothing.

429
00:30:15,649 --> 00:30:19,288
You're the last person that
has a right to be talking.

430
00:30:19,351 --> 00:30:20,954
Okay. Okay.

431
00:30:23,455 --> 00:30:24,724
Guard.
No, Marco.

432
00:30:24,791 --> 00:30:26,460
Marco, wait.
No, Marco, wait.

433
00:30:26,526 --> 00:30:28,395
No, wait, son. Don't be
like that. Son.

434
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:29,596
Please.

435
00:30:39,706 --> 00:30:42,645
Everybody, look up here.
You see this?

436
00:30:42,709 --> 00:30:45,548
There's an open tournament in
Virginia in a couple of months.

437
00:30:45,612 --> 00:30:47,281
We're not ready for no tournament.

438
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:49,951
That might be true
and that might not be.

439
00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:52,452
But one thing's for sure is
you're never going to find out

440
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:54,556
if you don't give it a try.

441
00:30:54,621 --> 00:30:59,329
If anybody wants to road trip,
there will be a sign up sheet.

442
00:30:59,391 --> 00:31:02,898
I ain't trying to be white, man.

443
00:31:02,962 --> 00:31:04,431
Fine, white goes first.

444
00:31:04,496 --> 00:31:06,366
White goes first.

445
00:31:06,432 --> 00:31:08,970
See, that shows you
how stupid this game is.

446
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:12,373
Hell yeah, black always got to go first.
Amen.

447
00:31:15,742 --> 00:31:18,848
T, you could be
one hell of a player.

448
00:31:18,911 --> 00:31:21,516
But your problem and everyone
else in this room's problem

449
00:31:21,581 --> 00:31:23,551
is you don't
give a damn about rules.

450
00:31:25,284 --> 00:31:26,520
Especially you.

451
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,563
What's the word?

452
00:31:35,629 --> 00:31:37,532
You got my money?

453
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:51,445
I know it's not as much as usual...

454
00:31:51,511 --> 00:31:54,349
You damn straight it's not as much.

455
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:55,047
Sales are down.

456
00:31:59,753 --> 00:32:01,590
Sales are down?

457
00:32:01,655 --> 00:32:03,491
What, you an economist now, negro?

458
00:32:08,662 --> 00:32:10,766
You know Eugene Brown?

459
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:12,499
Yeah.

460
00:32:12,565 --> 00:32:14,434
Yeah, I know Eugene Brown.
He's my man.

461
00:32:14,501 --> 00:32:16,638
Well, your man
is stealing your business.

462
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:20,941
'Cause I'm just saying.

463
00:32:21,006 --> 00:32:23,978
And he runs detention
over at Maud Alton now.

464
00:32:24,043 --> 00:32:26,287
He telling the kids not
to buy from me anymore.

465
00:32:26,313 --> 00:32:26,873
Hold up.

466
00:32:26,913 --> 00:32:29,417
Eugene Brown runs detention?

467
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:33,954
That's hilarious.

468
00:32:36,923 --> 00:32:38,358
Man, get the hell out of here.

469
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:41,927
Hey.

470
00:32:46,432 --> 00:32:49,371
You better start turning
over more product.

471
00:32:49,435 --> 00:32:51,038
Or I'm not even going to
think about coming up

472
00:32:51,103 --> 00:32:53,908
with that big job I've
been telling you about.

473
00:32:53,974 --> 00:32:55,042
Understand me?

474
00:32:58,377 --> 00:32:59,145
Go.

475
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:05,051
Darius.

476
00:33:05,117 --> 00:33:06,753
Who do you know over at Maud Alton

477
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:10,393
that can do Uncle Perry
a little favor?

478
00:33:28,775 --> 00:33:31,045
Hold on. Hold on.
Next time...

479
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:35,786
I'm going to get two pieces.

480
00:33:41,186 --> 00:33:43,524
Shut the door up.

481
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:44,825
Get out.

482
00:33:44,891 --> 00:33:46,126
What the hell?

483
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:48,996
Tahime, baby.

484
00:33:50,897 --> 00:33:52,967
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Wait. Wait.

485
00:33:53,033 --> 00:33:54,903
Damon's just my friend.

486
00:33:54,968 --> 00:33:57,105
I'm going to make some dinner.

487
00:33:57,169 --> 00:33:59,006
I got some spaghetti.

488
00:33:59,071 --> 00:34:01,709
Oh, baby.
I don't want to be here.

489
00:34:01,775 --> 00:34:03,531
Barging in like that.
What's wrong with you?

490
00:34:03,557 --> 00:34:04,805
You don't talk to him.
Get out!

491
00:34:04,844 --> 00:34:06,948
What's wrong with you?
Don't go. Where are you going?

492
00:34:07,013 --> 00:34:08,549
Come back at 9:00, okay?

493
00:34:08,615 --> 00:34:10,084
Got to go to school in the morning.

494
00:34:12,451 --> 00:34:17,160
In here, you're either teaching
lessons or you're learning them.

495
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:19,125
You must think before you move.

496
00:34:20,627 --> 00:34:22,530
Hey, Peanut.

497
00:34:22,595 --> 00:34:24,030
What are you doing?
What did I just say?

498
00:34:24,096 --> 00:34:25,833
Think before you make
your next move.

499
00:34:25,899 --> 00:34:26,900
And you didn't.

500
00:34:28,635 --> 00:34:32,008
Y'all got to start
paying attention, man.

501
00:34:32,072 --> 00:34:34,544
In here and in life.

502
00:34:34,607 --> 00:34:37,044
'Cause out in the streets,
it's not checkmate.

503
00:34:37,109 --> 00:34:39,012
It's incarceration.
It's wheelchair.

504
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:40,615
Man, I can't take
much more of this.

505
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,182
Peanut, get up, bro.

506
00:34:44,584 --> 00:34:45,919
I got you.

507
00:34:52,792 --> 00:34:54,595
You want to start over?

508
00:34:54,661 --> 00:34:55,261
I got him beat.

509
00:34:58,130 --> 00:34:59,733
No.

510
00:34:59,799 --> 00:35:00,700
Go.

511
00:35:01,801 --> 00:35:03,504
This is all I need.

512
00:36:00,827 --> 00:36:01,728
Check.

513
00:36:14,974 --> 00:36:16,242
Checkmate.

514
00:36:17,577 --> 00:36:19,847
Hey.

515
00:36:19,913 --> 00:36:22,150
Where did you learn how to do that?

516
00:36:22,214 --> 00:36:25,286
Told you, it's just
a simple stupid game, man.

517
00:36:38,765 --> 00:36:41,436
Got something I want to talk
to you about, all right, man?

518
00:36:41,462 --> 00:36:42,129
What's up?

519
00:36:42,168 --> 00:36:44,372
Can't tell nobody, all right?
I won't.

520
00:36:44,637 --> 00:36:45,605
I'm serious.

521
00:36:45,672 --> 00:36:46,807
I won't.

522
00:36:48,641 --> 00:36:51,178
Me and Cliff we got some
real things going on.

523
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:53,378
Real easy money.

524
00:36:54,948 --> 00:36:57,753
And I want you in on it with me.

525
00:36:57,817 --> 00:36:59,787
What you want me to do?

526
00:36:59,852 --> 00:37:01,722
Try it.
Just in case, you know?

527
00:37:03,723 --> 00:37:05,225
All I got to do is roll?

528
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:06,926
Yeah, man.

529
00:37:10,163 --> 00:37:11,098
You trust me?

530
00:37:11,164 --> 00:37:14,236
I trust you.

531
00:37:14,299 --> 00:37:15,702
I want you in on this with me.

532
00:37:16,703 --> 00:37:17,838
For real.

533
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:21,676
All right.
My man.

534
00:37:24,644 --> 00:37:27,649
Okay, so, that-that's...
I got it put away this time.

535
00:37:27,714 --> 00:37:29,316
It's a whole body throw.

536
00:37:29,381 --> 00:37:31,151
Nothing, 'cause you
about to airball it.

537
00:37:31,217 --> 00:37:33,789
Oh, I did it. I'm a beast.
Uh-oh.

538
00:37:33,853 --> 00:37:35,355
Oh, man.
I'm a beast. I told you.

539
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:36,890
You're right on the ball.

540
00:37:44,764 --> 00:37:46,801
Ms. King, you said
you wanted to see me?

541
00:37:46,866 --> 00:37:49,270
Oh, yes, I-I-I did. Come on in.
Have a seat.

542
00:37:49,296 --> 00:37:49,896
Okay.

543
00:37:54,807 --> 00:37:56,409
This isn't easy for me.

544
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:00,997
Who gave you this?

545
00:38:01,023 --> 00:38:03,878
Someone dropped it in my
mailbox yesterday afternoon.

546
00:38:03,916 --> 00:38:06,220
Listen, I'm not the same
man I was back then.

547
00:38:09,022 --> 00:38:10,391
You lied to me, Mr. Brown.

548
00:38:12,025 --> 00:38:13,327
I have to let you go.

549
00:38:19,398 --> 00:38:21,435
You should see these kids, man.
They're learning.

550
00:38:21,701 --> 00:38:23,270
I'm against the wall here, though,

551
00:38:23,335 --> 00:38:25,305
and I don't have a choice.
I'm sorry.

552
00:38:33,246 --> 00:38:36,820
Chess is no different than life.

553
00:38:36,883 --> 00:38:41,759
These suburban kids, they
know they get good grades,

554
00:38:41,821 --> 00:38:43,958
they go off to college.

555
00:38:44,023 --> 00:38:46,327
They know they're going to own
their own business someday.

556
00:38:46,391 --> 00:38:48,228
They envision the end game.

557
00:38:48,294 --> 00:38:50,164
But poor kids
don't think like that.

558
00:38:50,229 --> 00:38:52,734
Mr. Brown, I...
I wasn't taught like that.

559
00:38:52,799 --> 00:38:54,168
I didn't... I didn't
see the end game

560
00:38:54,233 --> 00:38:55,736
and it cost me, man.
It cost me big.

561
00:38:55,802 --> 00:38:56,803
I know.

562
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:03,947
I am still here for you
and the chess program.

563
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:06,880
Just not in the school.

564
00:39:09,015 --> 00:39:10,217
Not anymore.

565
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:21,396
Hey, Mr. Brown.

566
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:23,832
Get back to class, Peanut.

567
00:39:23,896 --> 00:39:25,231
You mad at me?

568
00:39:25,298 --> 00:39:27,101
No.

569
00:39:27,166 --> 00:39:30,238
But chess club is cancelled.

570
00:39:30,303 --> 00:39:33,308
What? Why?

571
00:39:33,373 --> 00:39:35,310
Politics.

572
00:39:35,375 --> 00:39:36,544
Politics?

573
00:39:36,809 --> 00:39:39,046
Man, that's an excuse.

574
00:39:39,112 --> 00:39:41,483
What about fighting
our way out of a corner?

575
00:39:45,952 --> 00:39:47,387
What was I thinking, man?

576
00:39:49,789 --> 00:39:51,792
Chess.

577
00:40:12,011 --> 00:40:14,482
I don't think you guys
want to buy in.

578
00:40:20,219 --> 00:40:23,091
Take all that money.
I'm going to raise you again.

579
00:40:29,829 --> 00:40:32,433
All right, put some
more money down.

580
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,536
Oh. that's not bad.

581
00:40:35,601 --> 00:40:37,337
Give me my three already.
No.

582
00:40:40,106 --> 00:40:42,109
Oh, snap.

583
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:46,114
Mean Gene Brown.

584
00:40:46,179 --> 00:40:47,447
The one with the frown.

585
00:40:47,513 --> 00:40:49,984
So, what's up, man?

586
00:40:50,049 --> 00:40:53,021
Guess I just had to
see this place again.

587
00:40:53,085 --> 00:40:56,257
Word on the street
is you lost your job.

588
00:40:56,322 --> 00:41:00,263
Look, it's hard out
there for an ex-con.

589
00:41:00,326 --> 00:41:02,631
And the system's not even set up

590
00:41:02,895 --> 00:41:05,266
to support going straight.

591
00:41:05,331 --> 00:41:07,334
That's just the world, baby,

592
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:10,940
trying to keep another
beautiful black man down.

593
00:41:13,072 --> 00:41:15,944
That's all right, though, because
I'm going to help you out.

594
00:41:16,008 --> 00:41:17,276
I owe you at least that.

595
00:41:22,248 --> 00:41:24,953
Why are you looking at
me like that, Mean Gene?

596
00:41:25,017 --> 00:41:26,152
Huh?

597
00:41:26,219 --> 00:41:28,089
All right.
All right.

598
00:41:28,154 --> 00:41:30,391
There you go.

599
00:41:30,456 --> 00:41:34,430
Oh, oh, you don't have
to do nothing for this.

600
00:41:34,494 --> 00:41:35,897
It's on the house.

601
00:41:39,098 --> 00:41:41,235
You just don't get it, brother.

602
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:44,573
I'm one of the pillars
in this community now.

603
00:41:44,637 --> 00:41:47,108
Look, I help these folks out.

604
00:41:47,173 --> 00:41:51,214
The way that the government don't
have the time or the means to.

605
00:41:51,277 --> 00:41:53,615
I'm going to help you out
a little bit, too.

606
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:55,181
Come on, baby.

607
00:41:57,350 --> 00:41:58,553
Come on home.

608
00:42:11,097 --> 00:42:13,502
It's always good
chatting with you, Perry.

609
00:42:17,603 --> 00:42:19,339
See you soon, Gene.

610
00:42:22,074 --> 00:42:23,309
See you real soon.

611
00:42:40,293 --> 00:42:42,430
Hey, yo.

612
00:42:42,495 --> 00:42:45,434
Anybody want to come to the park
and play some chess with me?

613
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,572
Hey, janitor, that was detention.

614
00:42:50,636 --> 00:42:52,639
We had to be there.

615
00:42:52,705 --> 00:42:55,209
You don't even work here no more.

616
00:42:55,274 --> 00:42:58,146
Hey, T, you want
to waste your potential, too?

617
00:42:58,210 --> 00:42:58,744
Huh?

618
00:43:00,514 --> 00:43:01,749
Come on, man.

619
00:43:04,617 --> 00:43:06,386
Yo, Peanut.

620
00:43:06,452 --> 00:43:09,424
Let's go get a game at the park, man.
Come on.

621
00:43:09,488 --> 00:43:11,659
No, man.
I don't like the politics.

622
00:43:11,724 --> 00:43:14,195
Oh, it's like that?

623
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:39,385
Nicely done.

624
00:43:44,724 --> 00:43:46,226
What's up with Tahime?

625
00:43:46,292 --> 00:43:48,462
Why is he so attached to Clifton?

626
00:43:48,528 --> 00:43:52,201
Well, you know, Clifton was always
the biggest kid in the class.

627
00:43:52,264 --> 00:43:55,403
It's been like that
since we was babies.

628
00:43:55,468 --> 00:43:57,673
And T, man, he's just as scared
to be on the streets as me,

629
00:43:57,737 --> 00:44:03,047
but he's not going to say nothing.

630
00:44:03,109 --> 00:44:04,244
You're a good man, Peanut.

631
00:44:08,247 --> 00:44:11,587
And this is for you.

632
00:44:11,652 --> 00:44:13,221
It's official.

633
00:44:13,285 --> 00:44:15,088
You're president of the chess club.

634
00:44:15,154 --> 00:44:16,690
Chess club?

635
00:44:16,756 --> 00:44:18,726
It's just you and me.

636
00:44:18,791 --> 00:44:20,326
We don't even have a homeroom, man.

637
00:44:20,393 --> 00:44:21,428
Everybody has that.

638
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:30,171
Well, it is what it is.

639
00:44:30,236 --> 00:44:32,239
It's beautiful.

640
00:44:32,304 --> 00:44:34,107
It's where it's all
going to happen.

641
00:44:34,173 --> 00:44:35,576
What's going to happen?

642
00:44:35,642 --> 00:44:36,376
A bonfire?

643
00:44:38,077 --> 00:44:40,549
You got to have
a little vision, Peanut.

644
00:44:40,614 --> 00:44:42,551
Sure, it needs some work.

645
00:44:42,616 --> 00:44:44,385
But when I look at this place,

646
00:44:44,450 --> 00:44:46,655
I see a mansion of possibilities.

647
00:45:02,669 --> 00:45:04,204
Hello?

648
00:45:04,270 --> 00:45:06,207
Katrina, it's your father.

649
00:45:06,272 --> 00:45:07,273
I can't talk right now.

650
00:45:07,339 --> 00:45:09,309
Oh, I understand.

651
00:45:09,375 --> 00:45:10,143
Maybe later.

652
00:45:13,179 --> 00:45:14,549
Is everything all right?

653
00:45:14,614 --> 00:45:17,519
Oh no, yeah, everything's fine.

654
00:45:17,584 --> 00:45:20,523
I just...

655
00:45:20,587 --> 00:45:22,389
you know, I want...
I wanted to tell you

656
00:45:22,455 --> 00:45:24,593
that I was...
I'm thinking about opening up

657
00:45:24,658 --> 00:45:26,695
a community chess house.

658
00:45:26,759 --> 00:45:29,230
There's some pretty good
little players at that school.

659
00:45:29,295 --> 00:45:31,833
A chess house? How are you going
to be able to afford that?

660
00:45:31,897 --> 00:45:33,800
Well, I've been...

661
00:45:33,866 --> 00:45:36,605
I've been
looking around a little bit.

662
00:45:36,670 --> 00:45:38,840
A lot of these houses
have been foreclosed on.

663
00:45:38,904 --> 00:45:41,174
I can probably rent one
for next to nothing.

664
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:45,481
You know, Billy
lent me some money already.

665
00:45:45,545 --> 00:45:49,619
Katrina, I know things aren't
exactly right between us.

666
00:45:49,683 --> 00:45:51,485
But maybe they can be
for those kids.

667
00:45:53,352 --> 00:45:57,594
Since when do you care
so much about kids, Eugene?

668
00:45:57,657 --> 00:45:59,727
Since I lost you.

669
00:46:06,365 --> 00:46:09,304
To refresh, ladies, pawns
can move two spots

670
00:46:09,368 --> 00:46:10,838
Or one...

671
00:46:13,707 --> 00:46:16,746
How goes it, gentlemen?

672
00:46:16,809 --> 00:46:18,712
Nice place you got here, chess man.

673
00:46:18,779 --> 00:46:20,849
Did it come with asbestos?

674
00:46:20,913 --> 00:46:22,716
Hey, if you're not
here to help, Clifton,

675
00:46:22,783 --> 00:46:24,452
you're more than welcome to leave.

676
00:46:24,518 --> 00:46:26,287
Oh, that's cool,
we just came for Peanut.

677
00:46:26,352 --> 00:46:27,722
Peanut?
Peanut is...

678
00:46:27,788 --> 00:46:29,457
He ain't going nowhere.
He's working.

679
00:46:29,523 --> 00:46:31,727
Working for who?
For you?

680
00:46:31,792 --> 00:46:33,962
Peanut, he paying you?

681
00:46:34,226 --> 00:46:36,196
Come on, Cliff.
No, you got W2s?

682
00:46:36,262 --> 00:46:37,832
I mean, was there
an interview process?

683
00:46:37,897 --> 00:46:39,700
Let me see your resume.
Please. Come on.

684
00:46:39,766 --> 00:46:41,766
Yo, if he don't want to go,
man, just let him stay.

685
00:46:41,802 --> 00:46:42,837
No, he's coming.

686
00:46:43,770 --> 00:46:44,905
Let's go.

687
00:46:44,970 --> 00:46:46,840
I just told you he stays.

688
00:46:46,906 --> 00:46:48,909
Now, if you want to throw
your life away, so be it.

689
00:46:48,974 --> 00:46:50,409
But he's with me.

690
00:46:52,912 --> 00:46:54,982
What's up, son?
Hey, hey, hey. It's cool, it's cool.

691
00:46:55,247 --> 00:46:57,819
You don't want this. You don't want it.
It's cool.

692
00:46:57,883 --> 00:46:58,951
Please.

693
00:47:06,258 --> 00:47:08,896
I'm here for you, son.

694
00:47:08,961 --> 00:47:09,829
Hear me?

695
00:47:39,024 --> 00:47:40,594
Flash your lights.

696
00:47:42,863 --> 00:47:44,432
Think they're still...

697
00:47:52,806 --> 00:47:54,008
All right.

698
00:47:55,441 --> 00:47:56,744
Now, T, you come with me.

699
00:47:56,810 --> 00:47:58,045
Peanut, stay with the car.

700
00:47:58,310 --> 00:47:59,613
Alone?

701
00:47:59,679 --> 00:48:01,415
Alone?

702
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:03,985
Little PB don't want to stay alone?

703
00:48:04,049 --> 00:48:06,754
All right, T,
you stay with the car.

704
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:08,890
Peanut, you bring
your simple self with me.

705
00:48:08,954 --> 00:48:11,385
Yo, Cliff, I don't think
that's such a good...

706
00:48:11,411 --> 00:48:12,018
Shut up.

707
00:48:20,834 --> 00:48:22,504
Stay focused, man, all right?

708
00:48:24,303 --> 00:48:25,739
Let's go. Peanut.

709
00:48:31,076 --> 00:48:33,480
You have to envision the end game.

710
00:48:35,014 --> 00:48:38,019
Anytime you find yourself behind,

711
00:48:38,083 --> 00:48:40,020
your mind got you there.

712
00:48:42,822 --> 00:48:45,359
When we get up there you
know I do the talking, right?

713
00:48:45,424 --> 00:48:47,060
Don't trip.
I got you.

714
00:48:49,361 --> 00:48:51,331
Yo, what's up?
What y'all got?

715
00:48:56,503 --> 00:48:59,074
No.

716
00:48:59,338 --> 00:49:01,509
This is the king.

717
00:49:01,574 --> 00:49:03,778
The king is your life.

718
00:49:03,843 --> 00:49:05,646
One mistake...

719
00:49:05,712 --> 00:49:07,682
I-I don't got the cash, bro.

720
00:49:07,747 --> 00:49:08,915
And it can be taken.

721
00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:11,780
Get up, man.

722
00:50:12,679 --> 00:50:13,814
Get up.

723
00:50:25,457 --> 00:50:26,793
Peanut, man.

724
00:50:27,961 --> 00:50:29,163
There's that thinking.

725
00:50:29,428 --> 00:50:30,597
Ooh.

726
00:50:33,833 --> 00:50:37,005
I can see if you're
cheating me from over here.

727
00:50:37,069 --> 00:50:38,705
Big Chair Chess Club.

728
00:50:41,641 --> 00:50:44,112
You stay right there.
I'm on my way.

729
00:50:58,892 --> 00:51:00,695
Tahime.

730
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:01,460
Hey.

731
00:51:02,562 --> 00:51:04,799
What's up?

732
00:51:04,864 --> 00:51:08,638
What's going on, man?
Where's Peanut?

733
00:51:08,701 --> 00:51:11,172
Oh, man.
What did you do?

734
00:51:11,236 --> 00:51:12,973
Huh?
Hey, hey.

735
00:51:13,039 --> 00:51:15,042
What did you do, man?

736
00:51:15,107 --> 00:51:16,242
What's going on?

737
00:51:16,509 --> 00:51:18,478
Talk to me.

738
00:51:18,545 --> 00:51:21,016
Talk to me, man.
What's going on?

739
00:51:30,023 --> 00:51:31,258
I got you.

740
00:51:32,491 --> 00:51:33,894
I got you, son.

741
00:51:57,249 --> 00:51:59,821
Girls left the door unlocked.

742
00:53:03,082 --> 00:53:03,917
Hi.

743
00:53:03,983 --> 00:53:04,818
Tahime.

744
00:53:07,219 --> 00:53:08,622
How are you doing?

745
00:53:11,858 --> 00:53:13,327
I'm going to miss him, too.

746
00:53:15,895 --> 00:53:17,632
He was always really sweet.

747
00:53:17,697 --> 00:53:19,166
I don't know about all that.

748
00:53:20,667 --> 00:53:21,902
Ooh.

749
00:53:21,968 --> 00:53:22,636
Yo, T.

750
00:53:23,836 --> 00:53:25,739
Yo. let's ride. man.

751
00:53:25,805 --> 00:53:27,675
We're going down to Spiders.

752
00:53:27,740 --> 00:53:28,741
I'm good.

753
00:53:30,643 --> 00:53:33,982
Look, man, I miss
the little guy, too.

754
00:53:34,047 --> 00:53:36,384
But that's how life is
on these streets, man.

755
00:53:38,250 --> 00:53:40,220
I'm going to make
the run myself this time.

756
00:53:42,055 --> 00:53:44,092
I hope we can put this behind us.

757
00:53:45,124 --> 00:53:45,992
For your sake.

758
00:53:49,128 --> 00:53:50,230
What's up, Michelle?

759
00:53:51,396 --> 00:53:52,397
Stop.

760
00:54:08,648 --> 00:54:09,248
Are you okay?

761
00:54:20,325 --> 00:54:22,763
A young man is dead because of me.

762
00:54:24,097 --> 00:54:25,432
I should have never let him go.

763
00:54:25,698 --> 00:54:27,333
It's not true and you know it.

764
00:54:36,943 --> 00:54:39,915
You know what?

765
00:54:39,979 --> 00:54:44,020
For the first time in my life,
I am actually very proud of you.

766
00:54:45,350 --> 00:54:48,990
You started something here.

767
00:54:49,055 --> 00:54:51,760
They don't listen, Trini.

768
00:54:51,824 --> 00:54:53,092
They don't listen.
I didn't.

769
00:54:53,159 --> 00:54:55,998
Your brother doesn't.

770
00:54:56,062 --> 00:54:59,903
They see that easy money as the
only way out, and you know what?

771
00:54:59,966 --> 00:55:04,140
Sometimes I don't blame them
for thinking that way.

772
00:55:04,203 --> 00:55:05,940
So you're just going to give up?

773
00:55:06,005 --> 00:55:08,342
They think I'm nuts, okay?

774
00:55:08,407 --> 00:55:10,377
Trini, they think I'm looney.

775
00:55:10,442 --> 00:55:12,412
And you know what?
I'm starting to believe them.

776
00:55:12,477 --> 00:55:13,847
I'm starting to believe them.

777
00:55:13,913 --> 00:55:15,015
You ain't nuts.

778
00:55:18,251 --> 00:55:20,188
Clifton, he's nuts.
But you...

779
00:55:22,955 --> 00:55:23,756
You're all right.

780
00:55:34,901 --> 00:55:37,438
Where did you get this?

781
00:55:37,503 --> 00:55:40,441
Peanut had that in his hand
before the police came.

782
00:55:59,292 --> 00:56:00,795
Let's clean this place up, man.

783
00:56:01,961 --> 00:56:02,996
Yeah.

784
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:03,952
This is a key.

785
00:58:04,016 --> 00:58:06,453
See that?

786
00:58:06,519 --> 00:58:08,188
This is how it works.

787
00:58:09,555 --> 00:58:10,523
Any questions?

788
00:58:47,927 --> 00:58:51,133
Man, what the hell you
doing waking me up, man?

789
00:58:51,197 --> 00:58:53,267
Don't you walk away from me.

790
00:58:53,332 --> 00:58:54,601
I ain't your mama.

791
00:59:02,675 --> 00:59:04,144
Oh, you want to fight.

792
00:59:04,210 --> 00:59:05,478
You want to...

793
00:59:30,236 --> 00:59:31,004
Hey.

794
00:59:33,973 --> 00:59:35,008
What's wrong?

795
00:59:38,144 --> 00:59:39,246
Tahime, talk to me.

796
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:43,251
I'm going to kill
my mom's boyfriend.

797
00:59:43,316 --> 00:59:44,752
What?

798
00:59:45,017 --> 00:59:46,219
I'm going to get a gun

799
00:59:46,285 --> 00:59:47,554
and I'm going to shoot him.

800
00:59:49,455 --> 00:59:53,196
I don't care what happens to me.
I don't care.

801
00:59:53,259 --> 00:59:55,029
But he ain't going
to touch nobody no more,

802
00:59:55,094 --> 00:59:56,630
not me, not her not nobody.

803
00:59:56,696 --> 00:59:59,434
I swear on God he ain't
going to touch nobody.

804
00:59:59,498 --> 01:00:02,705
What do you think
that's going to prove?

805
01:00:02,768 --> 01:00:06,040
I was locked up for 17 years...

806
01:00:06,105 --> 01:00:07,173
in prison.

807
01:00:07,239 --> 01:00:09,677
I just got out.

808
01:00:09,742 --> 01:00:12,681
I spent almost
two decades in the joint.

809
01:00:16,583 --> 01:00:23,630
I blamed everything
on everybody else but me.

810
01:00:23,689 --> 01:00:27,095
I was just touching the pieces,

811
01:00:27,159 --> 01:00:30,131
moving them whenever I could

812
01:00:30,196 --> 01:00:32,501
without thought.

813
01:00:32,566 --> 01:00:35,638
That's why none of y'all
can get nothing over on me.

814
01:00:35,701 --> 01:00:39,441
Because I've done all the dumb
stuff that y'all have done twice.

815
01:00:40,706 --> 01:00:42,609
Some of it three times.

816
01:00:42,675 --> 01:00:43,643
What did you do?

817
01:00:45,612 --> 01:00:46,780
Whatever I wanted to do.

818
01:00:48,481 --> 01:00:51,754
I stole.

819
01:00:51,817 --> 01:00:53,186
I even ran a crew.

820
01:00:55,721 --> 01:00:57,791
And they gave you
17 years for that?

821
01:00:58,057 --> 01:00:59,426
No.

822
01:00:59,492 --> 01:01:03,634
I got my 17 years
for armed robbery.

823
01:01:03,696 --> 01:01:04,764
I robbed a bank.

824
01:01:10,102 --> 01:01:12,072
Cops came and we all scattered.

825
01:01:16,643 --> 01:01:18,546
And I took the fall.

826
01:01:21,380 --> 01:01:23,383
And then I learned.

827
01:01:23,449 --> 01:01:24,518
What did you learn?

828
01:01:24,584 --> 01:01:26,086
I learned the board.

829
01:01:29,523 --> 01:01:31,359
Your move.

830
01:01:32,758 --> 01:01:33,291
Good.

831
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:35,362
Checkmate.

832
01:01:35,428 --> 01:01:36,664
Even better.

833
01:01:48,774 --> 01:01:51,846
Thank you.
This chess house, it's...

834
01:01:52,111 --> 01:01:53,213
it's amazing.

835
01:01:55,448 --> 01:01:59,757
You know, eight years I've
been at Maud Alton and...

836
01:01:59,819 --> 01:02:03,826
I've just been trying to make do
with what little money they give us.

837
01:02:03,889 --> 01:02:06,193
We're all doing the best we can,

838
01:02:06,258 --> 01:02:12,504
most of us high ups,
teachers, parents, kids.

839
01:02:12,566 --> 01:02:17,609
In all my years I have seen very
few people make a real difference.

840
01:02:20,873 --> 01:02:22,710
These kids...

841
01:02:24,143 --> 01:02:25,144
they need you.

842
01:02:26,779 --> 01:02:29,885
And your life before...

843
01:02:30,149 --> 01:02:33,321
and who you have become now...

844
01:02:33,385 --> 01:02:35,556
you inspire me, Mr. Brown.

845
01:02:38,725 --> 01:02:40,160
You really do.

846
01:02:49,636 --> 01:02:51,673
It's really coming together.

847
01:02:51,738 --> 01:02:54,944
This Tahime Sanders is a beast.
I talked to Marco last week.

848
01:02:55,207 --> 01:02:56,375
Really?

849
01:02:56,442 --> 01:02:58,412
He's coming home early.

850
01:02:58,477 --> 01:02:59,580
Wow.

851
01:02:59,646 --> 01:03:00,914
Wow, that's good news.

852
01:03:03,182 --> 01:03:04,718
Can I drive you to pick him up?

853
01:03:07,587 --> 01:03:09,757
I don't know.
Oh, no, no.

854
01:03:09,822 --> 01:03:12,359
Trini, you got to...
you got to do this for me.

855
01:03:12,424 --> 01:03:13,894
It would mean a lot to me.

856
01:03:13,959 --> 01:03:16,229
I got to be there for him
when he gets out.

857
01:03:16,295 --> 01:03:17,898
Show him how much I changed.

858
01:03:17,963 --> 01:03:19,198
Please.

859
01:03:21,768 --> 01:03:22,536
Sunday.

860
01:03:24,336 --> 01:03:26,339
That's what I'm talking about.

861
01:03:48,562 --> 01:03:49,597
That's nice.

862
01:03:52,666 --> 01:03:54,503
He in a better place now, anyways.

863
01:03:54,568 --> 01:03:55,670
Yeah.

864
01:03:56,703 --> 01:03:57,504
You all right?

865
01:03:59,972 --> 01:04:03,612
You know you got a ticket
out of this place, Tahime.

866
01:04:03,677 --> 01:04:06,749
You could be a special
player, a real pro.

867
01:04:06,813 --> 01:04:08,716
Just need the discipline.

868
01:04:09,949 --> 01:04:11,619
Check this out.

869
01:04:13,986 --> 01:04:15,622
This could be you.

870
01:04:17,757 --> 01:04:20,863
Maurice Ashley did it.
Who's to say you couldn't be next?

871
01:04:20,926 --> 01:04:21,894
Maurice who?

872
01:04:21,961 --> 01:04:23,363
Ah.

873
01:04:23,429 --> 01:04:26,636
Maurice Ashley from Harlem

874
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:29,438
was the first
African-American grandmaster.

875
01:04:29,502 --> 01:04:33,008
So, what? You're telling me
your brother's a grandmaster?

876
01:04:33,272 --> 01:04:35,543
Who's to say
there could only be one?

877
01:04:35,609 --> 01:04:38,046
Why ain't you one?

878
01:04:38,310 --> 01:04:40,548
If I had your natural
talent, I would be.

879
01:04:44,584 --> 01:04:45,986
Come on, man.

880
01:04:46,051 --> 01:04:47,788
I ain't about to be
embarrassing myself

881
01:04:47,854 --> 01:04:49,557
in some white man's competition.

882
01:04:49,623 --> 01:04:51,693
You going to think that
way your entire life?

883
01:04:51,758 --> 01:04:53,995
Every time you get an opportunity,

884
01:04:54,059 --> 01:04:57,365
you're going to run away
just because you're scared?

885
01:04:57,429 --> 01:04:58,598
I ain't scared.

886
01:04:58,665 --> 01:05:02,071
T, you have a real talent.

887
01:05:02,334 --> 01:05:05,339
And that'll take you further
than any money, race, class

888
01:05:05,404 --> 01:05:07,341
any day of the week.

889
01:05:07,406 --> 01:05:09,076
You could play
with these kids, man.

890
01:05:12,311 --> 01:05:13,814
And if I can't?

891
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:16,384
It ain't about whether
you can or you can't,

892
01:05:16,448 --> 01:05:19,688
it's about whether
you will or you won't.

893
01:05:19,753 --> 01:05:20,888
Believe that.

894
01:05:37,804 --> 01:05:39,084
Where the hell you been, Tahime?

895
01:05:39,104 --> 01:05:41,007
I was out...

896
01:05:41,073 --> 01:05:41,841
with Mr. Brown.

897
01:05:47,446 --> 01:05:49,617
I want you to do
something for me, okay?

898
01:05:52,084 --> 01:05:53,987
I want you to sign
this consent form

899
01:05:54,053 --> 01:05:56,725
so I can play in a chess tournament.
Chess tournament?

900
01:05:56,790 --> 01:05:59,094
What the hell you talking about?

901
01:05:59,358 --> 01:06:01,320
I told you, I've been
getting real good at chess.

902
01:06:01,346 --> 01:06:02,522
Give me a damn break, Tahime.

903
01:06:02,562 --> 01:06:04,732
You out there playing
some dumb ass game

904
01:06:04,798 --> 01:06:07,135
while the rest of us sitting
in here trying to survive.

905
01:06:07,399 --> 01:06:08,668
It ain't a dumb game.

906
01:06:08,735 --> 01:06:10,939
Is it a job?
You getting paid?

907
01:06:11,003 --> 01:06:12,639
Because if you ain't getting paid,

908
01:06:12,706 --> 01:06:14,186
I don't want to hear
nothing about it.

909
01:06:19,378 --> 01:06:19,878
Silly.

910
01:06:22,047 --> 01:06:22,775
If I'm good...

911
01:06:22,801 --> 01:06:25,712
Boy, you ain't good at nothing
but being a pain in my ass.

912
01:06:25,752 --> 01:06:27,956
Get-get out my face.
Go on.

913
01:06:28,020 --> 01:06:30,592
Go on.
Get out of my face.

914
01:06:30,657 --> 01:06:34,865
How the hell you think you can afford
to be in somebody chess contest?

915
01:06:34,928 --> 01:06:38,467
You think they let fools
like you in for free?

916
01:06:38,531 --> 01:06:41,002
Mr. Brown said he'd pay.
Oh. hell no. he ain't.

917
01:06:41,066 --> 01:06:44,540
And you ain't going to be
in no chess contest, either.

918
01:06:44,604 --> 01:06:46,741
No chess contest.

919
01:06:47,907 --> 01:06:49,109
Mr. Brown.

920
01:07:01,721 --> 01:07:02,856
Come on.

921
01:07:11,664 --> 01:07:13,099
Mr. Brown, I presume.
Yes, sir.

922
01:07:13,165 --> 01:07:14,968
Jerry Simpson,
assistant coordinator.

923
01:07:15,035 --> 01:07:16,538
It's a pleasure to have you here.

924
01:07:16,603 --> 01:07:18,740
It's a pleasure to be here, sir.

925
01:07:18,805 --> 01:07:20,909
What are...

926
01:07:20,974 --> 01:07:23,546
What are all the computers for?
That's how we play chess here.

927
01:07:23,610 --> 01:07:25,446
It's the way of the future.

928
01:07:25,512 --> 01:07:28,183
I trust you've used them?

929
01:07:28,447 --> 01:07:29,448
Yes, sir.

930
01:07:29,516 --> 01:07:31,586
Computers.

931
01:07:31,651 --> 01:07:34,091
All right, I want you to concentrate
and picture your end game.

932
01:07:34,119 --> 01:07:35,589
What's with the computers?

933
01:07:35,655 --> 01:07:37,224
A modern way of playing.

934
01:07:37,489 --> 01:07:40,161
Man, that's bull.
I want to play street style.

935
01:07:40,225 --> 01:07:43,230
You are going to play on a
computer and behave, you hear me?

936
01:07:43,495 --> 01:07:45,800
Now, listen.
No trash talking, no cursing.

937
01:07:45,865 --> 01:07:47,668
Just play your game.

938
01:07:47,734 --> 01:07:49,103
No trash talking, no cursing?

939
01:07:49,168 --> 01:07:50,871
That is my game.

940
01:07:50,937 --> 01:07:52,807
They're ready to start.
You need to register.

941
01:07:52,872 --> 01:07:54,074
Right. Right.

942
01:07:54,139 --> 01:07:55,775
Give me your consent forms.

943
01:07:57,043 --> 01:07:58,880
Good. Good. Good.

944
01:08:09,722 --> 01:08:11,892
Hello.
I'm Eugene Brown.

945
01:08:11,958 --> 01:08:13,861
Registering my kids.

946
01:08:19,699 --> 01:08:21,502
And the eighth?
Here's the thing...

947
01:08:21,568 --> 01:08:24,039
Actually, I left it in
the car, my registration.

948
01:08:24,104 --> 01:08:27,132
Is there any possible way you think
I could have enough time to go...

949
01:08:27,158 --> 01:08:27,936
If you're quick.

950
01:08:27,974 --> 01:08:29,242
Thank you so much.

951
01:09:04,176 --> 01:09:06,848
All right, sir.
You're all set.

952
01:09:06,913 --> 01:09:07,814
Great.

953
01:09:15,722 --> 01:09:17,559
Eugene Brown.

954
01:09:17,624 --> 01:09:21,765
I'm Roy Woodbury, host a
talk program over at KCAM.

955
01:09:21,828 --> 01:09:24,265
♪♪ KCAM ♪♪
Right. Yeah.

956
01:09:24,329 --> 01:09:26,667
Yeah, I just wanted to come
by and tell you I heard about

957
01:09:26,733 --> 01:09:29,093
what you're doing over there
at that house. It's good stuff.

958
01:09:29,135 --> 01:09:30,767
I got an assistant who
lives over that way.

959
01:09:30,793 --> 01:09:31,200
Oh, yeah?

960
01:09:31,236 --> 01:09:33,608
Yeah.

961
01:09:33,673 --> 01:09:35,008
Is he one of your students?

962
01:09:35,074 --> 01:09:37,111
Yeah. Yeah.
Tahime Sanders.

963
01:09:37,177 --> 01:09:38,178
Is he any good?

964
01:09:38,243 --> 01:09:39,913
Exceptional.

965
01:09:39,979 --> 01:09:43,586
Well, I just wanted
to wish you good luck.

966
01:09:43,650 --> 01:09:46,354
Oh, hey, sorry, I'm distracted.

967
01:09:46,619 --> 01:09:48,689
I haven't had jitters
like this in years.

968
01:09:48,755 --> 01:09:50,792
Come on, man, that's the fun part.

969
01:10:00,332 --> 01:10:02,369
Relax. Relax.
Think.

970
01:12:14,901 --> 01:12:16,069
Checkmate.

971
01:12:16,135 --> 01:12:16,681
Checkmate.

972
01:12:16,707 --> 01:12:17,362
Yes!
Yes!

973
01:12:18,738 --> 01:12:19,773
All right.

974
01:12:19,839 --> 01:12:21,776
We have a problem.

975
01:12:21,841 --> 01:12:24,412
After reviewing some
of your students' forms,

976
01:12:24,476 --> 01:12:27,315
it's fairly obvious that
one of them was forged.

977
01:12:27,379 --> 01:12:30,151
Now, Linda over at registration
alerted me to the fact that

978
01:12:30,216 --> 01:12:32,353
initially you didn't have
some of these forms signed,

979
01:12:32,417 --> 01:12:35,256
so I took a look at them,
and if you look,

980
01:12:35,321 --> 01:12:38,060
this one clearly was not
signed by an adult.

981
01:12:38,124 --> 01:12:40,896
Now, you forged a consent form,

982
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:45,201
and failed to submit any of the
students' birth certificates.

983
01:12:45,264 --> 01:12:48,470
Can I talk to you for...
I'm comfortable talking right here.

984
01:12:48,534 --> 01:12:51,405
Some of these kids
don't have birth certificates.

985
01:12:51,470 --> 01:12:53,140
Everybody's got
a birth certificate.

986
01:12:53,206 --> 01:12:55,343
Not where we come from.

987
01:12:55,407 --> 01:12:57,210
Then it's done.

988
01:12:57,276 --> 01:13:00,415
I'm sorry, but rules are rules.

989
01:13:00,479 --> 01:13:02,216
Alan wins.

990
01:13:03,448 --> 01:13:04,551
No.

991
01:13:05,885 --> 01:13:07,487
Wait.

992
01:13:07,553 --> 01:13:10,224
Eugene, that was
an absolute travesty.

993
01:13:10,289 --> 01:13:12,159
A crime.

994
01:13:12,225 --> 01:13:14,830
Wait.

995
01:13:14,894 --> 01:13:17,033
Well, there's nothing we
can do about it right now.

996
01:13:17,059 --> 01:13:18,292
That's not necessarily true.

997
01:13:18,331 --> 01:13:21,036
Why don't you and Tahime come
on the air tomorrow morning?

998
01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:22,870
State your case.

999
01:13:22,935 --> 01:13:24,296
Get the word out to the community.

1000
01:13:30,843 --> 01:13:32,312
For those of you just tuning in,

1001
01:13:32,378 --> 01:13:35,150
we are joined in studio
by Tahime Sanders

1002
01:13:35,214 --> 01:13:37,484
and his coach, Eugene Brown,

1003
01:13:37,550 --> 01:13:39,553
who were robbed
of a chess championship

1004
01:13:39,819 --> 01:13:42,390
this past weekend
at a local tournament.

1005
01:13:42,454 --> 01:13:46,328
Now, tell us,
Tahime, what happened?

1006
01:13:46,392 --> 01:13:49,866
Shed some light on this most
egregious theft of a championship.

1007
01:13:49,929 --> 01:13:52,868
It wasn't theft.

1008
01:13:52,932 --> 01:13:53,967
Come again?

1009
01:13:54,033 --> 01:13:55,836
It was not theft.

1010
01:13:55,902 --> 01:13:59,475
The rules were the rules
and we didn't obey them.

1011
01:13:59,539 --> 01:14:01,876
Mr. Brown,
I-I was there.

1012
01:14:01,941 --> 01:14:05,615
It is the job of Tahime
and every, every person

1013
01:14:05,878 --> 01:14:07,199
playing the game, black or white,

1014
01:14:07,246 --> 01:14:08,616
to beat them at their own game.

1015
01:14:08,881 --> 01:14:10,242
Their own rules.
We didn't do that.

1016
01:14:10,283 --> 01:14:11,853
Mr. B, we won.

1017
01:14:11,918 --> 01:14:14,523
We can't change the rules, Tahime.

1018
01:14:14,587 --> 01:14:16,323
We have to learn
to win within them.

1019
01:14:16,389 --> 01:14:17,625
That's what this is about.

1020
01:14:17,890 --> 01:14:21,129
But isn't creating a champion

1021
01:14:21,194 --> 01:14:22,630
what this is all about?

1022
01:14:22,895 --> 01:14:25,266
No, sir.
No, it's not.

1023
01:14:25,331 --> 01:14:28,538
It's about learning
how to play the game.

1024
01:14:28,601 --> 01:14:30,403
It's about changing minds.

1025
01:14:30,470 --> 01:14:33,543
And, in turn, learning about life.

1026
01:14:33,606 --> 01:14:36,645
The championship
isn't the end game.

1027
01:14:36,909 --> 01:14:38,512
The championship is a byproduct.

1028
01:14:42,949 --> 01:14:43,950
All right, then.

1029
01:14:46,252 --> 01:14:48,089
There you have it.

1030
01:14:48,154 --> 01:14:51,493
We'll be back in a minute,
plus weather and traffic.

1031
01:14:55,661 --> 01:14:57,965
What the hell is wrong
with you, brother?

1032
01:14:58,030 --> 01:15:00,434
You come down here
just to sell your guy out?

1033
01:15:00,501 --> 01:15:01,569
On the air.

1034
01:15:01,634 --> 01:15:03,036
I was making a point.

1035
01:15:03,102 --> 01:15:04,672
Yeah, well, you did that.

1036
01:15:50,383 --> 01:15:52,053
Tahime.

1037
01:15:52,118 --> 01:15:54,690
It's Mr. Brown, Tahime.

1038
01:15:54,954 --> 01:15:58,093
What are you knocking for?
Tahime ain't here.

1039
01:15:58,157 --> 01:15:58,838
You're who?

1040
01:15:58,864 --> 01:16:01,589
Eugene Brown, ma'am. I'm
sorry to bother you.

1041
01:16:01,627 --> 01:16:03,196
But your son comes
to my chess house.

1042
01:16:03,262 --> 01:16:06,101
Not anymore he don't.

1043
01:16:06,165 --> 01:16:07,316
Please, Ms. San...

1044
01:16:07,342 --> 01:16:10,666
Listen, you go on and
hustle somebody else's kid.

1045
01:16:10,703 --> 01:16:12,238
Selling my baby all them lies,

1046
01:16:12,305 --> 01:16:14,175
he's going to be a chess champion.

1047
01:16:14,240 --> 01:16:16,745
And he going to go
to school for chess.

1048
01:16:17,009 --> 01:16:18,679
You stay the hell away,
you hear me?

1049
01:16:18,744 --> 01:16:20,179
It ain't like that, Ms. San...

1050
01:16:20,246 --> 01:16:22,116
I said, stay the hell away.

1051
01:16:24,150 --> 01:16:25,753
Ms. Sanders.

1052
01:16:27,286 --> 01:16:28,589
Ms. Sanders.

1053
01:16:30,056 --> 01:16:31,692
Your son is the real deal.

1054
01:16:31,757 --> 01:16:33,326
You need to come and see him play.

1055
01:16:33,392 --> 01:16:35,395
Hear me?

1056
01:16:35,461 --> 01:16:38,601
I wasn't there for my kids
and I regret it every day.

1057
01:16:38,664 --> 01:16:40,701
Your son needs you.

1058
01:16:40,766 --> 01:16:42,168
He needs you.

1059
01:16:48,307 --> 01:16:49,743
Hey. Mr. B.

1060
01:16:50,009 --> 01:16:51,712
What you doing up here
at the Taj Mahal?

1061
01:16:51,777 --> 01:16:54,448
Y'all seen Tahime?
Yeah, he was with Clifton.

1062
01:16:54,514 --> 01:16:57,185
They were around some other dudes
in a car I've never seen before.

1063
01:16:57,249 --> 01:16:59,086
He said he had a job
or something about a...

1064
01:16:59,151 --> 01:17:00,152
the rec center.

1065
01:17:00,219 --> 01:17:01,387
Rec center, huh?

1066
01:17:01,454 --> 01:17:03,157
I think.
All right.

1067
01:17:03,222 --> 01:17:05,092
Hey, y'all come by
the chess house tomorrow.

1068
01:17:05,157 --> 01:17:06,627
We're having a mini tournament.

1069
01:17:06,692 --> 01:17:09,029
All right, Mr. B.
Right.

1070
01:17:18,437 --> 01:17:19,573
Tahime!

1071
01:17:22,041 --> 01:17:24,579
Hey, hey, hey, y'all seen Tahime?

1072
01:17:24,645 --> 01:17:25,713
No.
I ain't seen him.

1073
01:17:25,745 --> 01:17:27,080
You sure?

1074
01:17:27,146 --> 01:17:28,314
Tahime who?

1075
01:17:28,381 --> 01:17:30,552
Sanders.

1076
01:17:43,062 --> 01:17:45,734
Come on, Tahime.
Come on, baby.

1077
01:17:45,798 --> 01:17:47,467
Come on, young king.

1078
01:18:03,315 --> 01:18:05,720
Come on.

1079
01:18:39,653 --> 01:18:40,521
Hey.

1080
01:18:42,788 --> 01:18:45,693
I think Tahime is in
some real trouble.

1081
01:18:45,758 --> 01:18:48,630
It's amazing because you're so good

1082
01:18:48,695 --> 01:18:50,532
at caring about other people's kids

1083
01:18:50,597 --> 01:18:53,602
and completely incapable
of caring about your own.

1084
01:18:57,269 --> 01:18:58,739
Marco.

1085
01:18:58,804 --> 01:19:02,443
Oh, hey, man.
It's good to have you home.

1086
01:19:02,509 --> 01:19:04,178
Marco.

1087
01:19:04,243 --> 01:19:05,345
Hey.

1088
01:19:05,411 --> 01:19:07,214
Hey.

1089
01:19:38,678 --> 01:19:39,880
Tahime.

1090
01:19:39,945 --> 01:19:42,750
Where you been, man?
Huh?

1091
01:19:42,815 --> 01:19:45,921
You in trouble, son?
For what?

1092
01:19:46,185 --> 01:19:49,525
Don't "for what" me. I saw you get
arrested outside the rec center.

1093
01:19:49,589 --> 01:19:51,859
Man, I ain't get arrested.

1094
01:19:51,924 --> 01:19:54,461
That was Cliff and some other guys.

1095
01:19:54,528 --> 01:19:56,430
I thought you was with them.

1096
01:19:56,495 --> 01:19:57,764
I was.

1097
01:19:57,830 --> 01:19:59,399
I was in the car but...

1098
01:20:01,300 --> 01:20:02,670
Once I found out
what they was doing,

1099
01:20:02,736 --> 01:20:04,271
I just thought before I moved.

1100
01:20:10,376 --> 01:20:11,946
I'm glad you made
the right decision.

1101
01:20:13,212 --> 01:20:14,949
I guess.

1102
01:20:15,214 --> 01:20:17,886
You know, everybody else
says you're a phony.

1103
01:20:17,950 --> 01:20:18,918
I know you're not.

1104
01:20:25,991 --> 01:20:28,563
It's a bit much, son.

1105
01:20:28,628 --> 01:20:32,702
Some of these players
are rated 2,400 and up.

1106
01:20:32,766 --> 01:20:36,807
But it's in the district
and I want to play.

1107
01:20:36,869 --> 01:20:39,306
For me and...

1108
01:20:39,371 --> 01:20:39,905
Peanut.

1109
01:20:43,710 --> 01:20:45,914
Well, come on in here and
help me move these boxes.

1110
01:21:44,738 --> 01:21:45,873
Yeah.

1111
01:21:45,938 --> 01:21:48,943
Yo, it's Clifton.

1112
01:21:49,008 --> 01:21:50,511
Clifton.

1113
01:22:37,056 --> 01:22:38,124
Surprise!

1114
01:22:40,927 --> 01:22:42,530
What's all this?

1115
01:22:42,595 --> 01:22:43,964
What?
You forgot your own birthday?

1116
01:22:44,029 --> 01:22:45,431
How'd you know that?

1117
01:22:48,100 --> 01:22:52,976
Ms. King and I spent a couple
hours digging around city hall.

1118
01:22:53,038 --> 01:22:54,941
No more disqualifications.

1119
01:22:55,007 --> 01:22:59,549
This time we're going to beat
them at their own rules.

1120
01:22:59,612 --> 01:23:01,047
Come on, T.
Make a wish.

1121
01:23:20,834 --> 01:23:21,869
Really?

1122
01:23:21,935 --> 01:23:22,936
This place?

1123
01:23:23,003 --> 01:23:26,142
Yeah, this place.

1124
01:23:26,405 --> 01:23:27,106
All right.

1125
01:23:29,408 --> 01:23:30,744
I'm going to go run some errands.

1126
01:23:30,810 --> 01:23:31,811
I'll be back.

1127
01:23:33,913 --> 01:23:35,549
Thank you, Katrina.

1128
01:23:43,623 --> 01:23:46,595
First off, don't be mad at Trini.

1129
01:23:46,659 --> 01:23:49,430
She wanted no part of this.

1130
01:23:56,936 --> 01:24:00,042
I'm sorry I pissed away
the best years of my life.

1131
01:24:02,575 --> 01:24:07,518
And they weren't the best years
because I was a young man,

1132
01:24:07,580 --> 01:24:12,990
they were the best years because
I hadn't ruined your trust yet.

1133
01:24:13,053 --> 01:24:14,488
Man.

1134
01:24:16,121 --> 01:24:17,858
I don't even know you.

1135
01:24:21,027 --> 01:24:23,498
I'm-I'm trying to change that.

1136
01:24:25,932 --> 01:24:27,535
I need you, son.

1137
01:24:28,735 --> 01:24:31,239
I love you, Marco.

1138
01:24:31,504 --> 01:24:33,541
I always will.

1139
01:24:34,574 --> 01:24:35,742
No matter what.

1140
01:24:40,479 --> 01:24:42,216
Hi, Ms. Reavis.

1141
01:24:42,481 --> 01:24:45,053
Principal King said I can
make an announcement?

1142
01:24:46,251 --> 01:24:48,488
Attention. attention.

1143
01:24:48,555 --> 01:24:51,894
I would like to announce
our very own Tahime Sanders

1144
01:24:51,958 --> 01:24:54,162
will be participating
in the Eastern Champion...

1145
01:24:54,226 --> 01:24:56,931
Open Chess Tournament
this upcoming Sunday.

1146
01:24:56,996 --> 01:25:02,707
Everyone is encouraged to come on
down and watch him kick some...

1147
01:25:02,769 --> 01:25:05,508
watch him dominate the competition.

1148
01:25:05,572 --> 01:25:07,842
Oh, yeah.
My man.

1149
01:25:12,946 --> 01:25:14,849
I got somebody I want you to meet.

1150
01:25:35,902 --> 01:25:37,037
Family.

1151
01:25:38,738 --> 01:25:39,606
You good?

1152
01:25:39,672 --> 01:25:41,709
I'm good.

1153
01:25:41,774 --> 01:25:42,842
You look good.

1154
01:25:45,177 --> 01:25:46,680
This the boy you told me about?

1155
01:25:46,746 --> 01:25:48,583
Yes, sir.

1156
01:25:48,648 --> 01:25:50,718
This here is the chess man.

1157
01:25:50,783 --> 01:25:52,018
Taught me everything I know

1158
01:25:52,085 --> 01:25:53,688
right here in these walls.

1159
01:25:55,788 --> 01:25:57,658
So, Tahime.

1160
01:25:57,724 --> 01:25:58,625
You good, I hear.

1161
01:25:58,691 --> 01:25:59,893
Real good.

1162
01:25:59,959 --> 01:26:03,098
Unstudied, undisciplined.

1163
01:26:03,163 --> 01:26:04,566
Talking to him?

1164
01:26:12,271 --> 01:26:13,674
Big tournament, huh?

1165
01:26:16,009 --> 01:26:18,614
You ready?

1166
01:26:18,678 --> 01:26:19,534
As I'll ever be.

1167
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:22,342
Son, these cats are quick,
you got to be quicker.

1168
01:26:22,582 --> 01:26:25,320
And because of what you look
like, all eyes will be on you.

1169
01:26:25,585 --> 01:26:28,089
So you got to think tough.

1170
01:26:28,154 --> 01:26:28,889
Huh?

1171
01:26:30,590 --> 01:26:32,760
Now, this kid...

1172
01:26:32,825 --> 01:26:36,031
J. Thomas Gaines...

1173
01:26:36,095 --> 01:26:39,034
I wish I had a shot at him.

1174
01:26:39,098 --> 01:26:42,170
I got me a list of his
last 300 matches.

1175
01:26:42,234 --> 01:26:44,606
Got it sent to me
by a chess magazine,

1176
01:26:44,671 --> 01:26:46,775
felt bad that I was all locked up.

1177
01:26:46,839 --> 01:26:48,208
Free subscription for life.

1178
01:26:53,146 --> 01:26:55,651
If you face off with this Gaines,

1179
01:26:55,715 --> 01:26:58,219
he's got one particular move

1180
01:26:58,283 --> 01:27:01,322
that leaves him vulnerable,
almost without fail.

1181
01:27:01,386 --> 01:27:03,256
Amazing how nobody found it before.

1182
01:27:03,322 --> 01:27:06,227
But then again,
nobody's got as much time

1183
01:27:06,291 --> 01:27:08,629
on their hands as I do.

1184
01:27:08,695 --> 01:27:11,099
So, listen carefully.

1185
01:27:11,164 --> 01:27:14,270
You know he will relentlessly
pound you with his queen.

1186
01:27:14,333 --> 01:27:17,105
I know.

1187
01:27:17,170 --> 01:27:21,679
Know what?

1188
01:27:21,741 --> 01:27:23,343
Look, I appreciate all this.

1189
01:27:23,408 --> 01:27:27,784
I really do.
I just...

1190
01:27:27,847 --> 01:27:29,416
This is something
I have to by myself.

1191
01:27:40,660 --> 01:27:42,195
Respect.

1192
01:27:44,764 --> 01:27:46,133
Anything else, then?

1193
01:27:48,735 --> 01:27:49,903
You ever getting out of here?

1194
01:27:55,208 --> 01:27:59,249
Only my mind gets out...

1195
01:27:59,311 --> 01:28:01,014
every time I open up that board...

1196
01:28:03,216 --> 01:28:05,888
every time I open up a bible.

1197
01:28:09,922 --> 01:28:13,128
And it will be out when you are
playing in that tournament.

1198
01:28:34,213 --> 01:28:35,849
Tahime Sanders checking in.

1199
01:28:36,716 --> 01:28:38,151
Okay.

1200
01:28:38,217 --> 01:28:39,753
Put him in this section.

1201
01:28:39,819 --> 01:28:40,720
Yup.

1202
01:28:42,255 --> 01:28:43,490
Good luck, son.

1203
01:28:50,462 --> 01:28:53,234
You recognize that face?

1204
01:28:53,299 --> 01:28:55,504
J. Thomas Gaines, huh?

1205
01:28:55,768 --> 01:28:56,870
The one and only.

1206
01:29:26,799 --> 01:29:28,401
Hey, Tahime.

1207
01:29:31,070 --> 01:29:33,374
Concentrate here.

1208
01:29:33,438 --> 01:29:34,841
Women weaken legs.

1209
01:29:36,275 --> 01:29:37,511
It's chess.

1210
01:29:37,777 --> 01:29:40,214
What do I need my legs for?

1211
01:29:40,279 --> 01:29:41,882
Concentrate here.

1212
01:29:51,858 --> 01:29:53,828
Good afternoon. everyone.

1213
01:29:53,893 --> 01:29:57,432
And welcome to the
Washington, D.C. Chess Open.

1214
01:29:57,496 --> 01:30:01,270
As is customary, please
shake your opponent's hand.

1215
01:30:01,334 --> 01:30:02,503
Very good.

1216
01:30:02,568 --> 01:30:04,370
Now, start your clocks.

1217
01:30:19,451 --> 01:30:20,520
Yes.

1218
01:30:22,454 --> 01:30:26,295
You know you could've had him
on the tenth move, right?

1219
01:30:26,359 --> 01:30:27,995
Relax, chess man.

1220
01:30:28,060 --> 01:30:29,830
I'm just getting warmed up.

1221
01:30:40,406 --> 01:30:42,076
This guy is good.

1222
01:30:42,141 --> 01:30:43,611
Mm.

1223
01:30:43,876 --> 01:30:46,480
Can Tahime beat this guy?

1224
01:30:46,546 --> 01:30:49,217
Well, he's been one of
the best players

1225
01:30:49,282 --> 01:30:52,522
in the country since he was 15.

1226
01:30:52,585 --> 01:30:54,454
Anybody can be beat.

1227
01:30:56,556 --> 01:30:57,858
Even Gaines.

1228
01:32:09,495 --> 01:32:13,202
Ladies and gentlemen,
our two undefeated players.

1229
01:32:13,232 --> 01:32:16,271
J. Thomas Gaines
and Tahime Sanders.

1230
01:32:16,335 --> 01:32:18,940
will engage in an
Armageddon tiebreaker

1231
01:32:19,005 --> 01:32:21,944
to determine
our chess open champion.

1232
01:32:22,008 --> 01:32:24,278
Gentlemen. good luck.

1233
01:34:04,243 --> 01:34:05,111
Check.

1234
01:34:34,508 --> 01:34:35,643
Hey.

1235
01:35:12,745 --> 01:35:14,114
That's my baby.

1236
01:35:15,214 --> 01:35:16,282
My baby.

1237
01:35:47,581 --> 01:35:48,549
Thank you.

1238
01:35:51,450 --> 01:35:53,655
You done good.

1239
01:35:53,720 --> 01:35:56,738
Mr. Brown? My name is Danielle
Norton with Urban League.

1240
01:35:56,764 --> 01:35:57,518
Yes, ma'am.

1241
01:35:57,557 --> 01:36:00,461
This Tahime, has he made any
college plans yet?

1242
01:36:00,527 --> 01:36:02,229
Because I'd like to help.

1243
01:36:04,430 --> 01:36:05,398
I'll be in touch.

1244
01:36:09,536 --> 01:36:13,543
Hey, that's the first time
I've been scared all year.

1245
01:36:13,607 --> 01:36:16,311
You ain't got to try and make me
feel better. You know that, right?

1246
01:36:16,375 --> 01:36:18,747
Trust me.
I wouldn't do that.

1247
01:36:18,811 --> 01:36:19,946
Ever.

1248
01:36:21,881 --> 01:36:23,761
Hey, can I grab you for a
quick photo over here?

1249
01:36:25,552 --> 01:36:26,620
Mr. Brown.

1250
01:36:33,627 --> 01:36:34,562
Ready, guys?

1251
01:36:44,236 --> 01:36:45,739
Got to touch the king first.

1252
01:37:06,425 --> 01:37:07,628
Dad.

1253
01:37:14,501 --> 01:37:17,239
Glad you could make it.

1254
01:37:17,303 --> 01:37:19,841
Yeah, well, you know.
Thought I'd just check it out.

1255
01:37:21,340 --> 01:37:23,010
I'm happy to see you, son.

1256
01:37:28,280 --> 01:37:29,516
Let me show you around.

1257
01:37:32,952 --> 01:37:34,655
All right.

1258
01:37:34,721 --> 01:37:36,290
Boards.

1259
01:37:36,355 --> 01:37:37,356
Next champions.

1260
01:37:38,792 --> 01:37:40,562
Back here we have the kitchen.
