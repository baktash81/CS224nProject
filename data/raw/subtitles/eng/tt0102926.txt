Reached for a comment
on the ski slopes
of Stowe, Vermont,

701
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:30,943
the president
himself said to be,

702
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:32,862
and I quote,
"Intensely concerned."

703
00:50:32,946 --> 00:50:34,447
Just moments ago,
Senator Martin

704
00:50:34,489 --> 00:50:37,450
taped this dramatic
personal plea.
Excuse me.

705
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:41,203
MARTIN: I'm speaking now
to the person who is
holding my daughter.

706
00:50:42,456 --> 00:50:45,291
Catherine is very
gentle and kind.

707
00:50:46,501 --> 00:50:48,627
Talk to her, and you'll see.

708
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:53,299
You have the power.
You are in charge.

709
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:59,638
I know you can feel
love and compassion.

710
00:51:01,266 --> 00:51:04,643
You have a wonderful chance
to show the whole world

711
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:08,230
that you can be merciful
as well as strong,

712
00:51:08,857 --> 00:51:11,275
that you're big enough
to treat Catherine

713
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:13,736
better than the world
has treated you.

714
00:51:14,279 --> 00:51:16,030
You have that power.

715
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:17,782
Please.

716
00:51:18,658 --> 00:51:20,618
My daughter is Catherine.

717
00:51:20,702 --> 00:51:21,702
ARDELlA: Boy, that's smart.

718
00:51:21,787 --> 00:51:22,912
Release her unharmed.

719
00:51:22,996 --> 00:51:24,455
Jesus, that's really smart.

720
00:51:24,539 --> 00:51:26,749
MAN: She keeps
repeating the name.

721
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:30,252
lf he sees
Catherine as a person
and not just an object,

722
00:51:30,337 --> 00:51:32,505
it's harder to tear her up.

723
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:34,757
Please.
Release my little girl.

724
00:51:35,967 --> 00:51:37,301
What you're doing,
Miss Starling,

725
00:51:37,385 --> 00:51:39,595
is coming into my hospital
to conduct an interview

726
00:51:39,679 --> 00:51:42,807
and refusing to share
information with me
for the third time.

727
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,851
Sir, l told you,

728
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:48,104
this is just
a routine follow-up
on the Raspail case.

729
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:50,314
He is my patient.
l have rights.

730
00:51:50,398 --> 00:51:51,607
l understand that, sir.

731
00:51:51,691 --> 00:51:55,861
Look, l am not
just some turnkey,
Miss Starling.

732
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:59,490
This is the number for
the U.S. Attorney's
office.

733
00:51:59,574 --> 00:52:01,826
Please, either you
discuss this with him,

734
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:04,203
or you let me do my job.

737

promises you
a transfer

738
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:21,512
to the V.A. Hospital
at Oneida Park, New York,

739
00:52:21,596 --> 00:52:22,930
with a view of
the woods nearby.

740
00:52:23,014 --> 00:52:25,724
Maximum security
still applies,
of course.

741
00:52:25,934 --> 00:52:28,602
You'd have reasonable
access to books.

742
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:31,230
Best of all, though.

743
00:52:31,731 --> 00:52:33,315
One week of the year,

744
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:37,486
you get to leave
the hospital and
go here.

746
00:52:43,743 --> 00:52:46,996
Every day of that week
you may walk on the beach,

747
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:49,665
you may swim in the ocean
for up to one hour,

748
00:52:49,749 --> 00:52:53,169
under SWAT team surveillance,
of course.

749
00:52:53,795 --> 00:52:55,671
And there you have it.

750
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:01,927
A copy of the
Buffalo Bill
case file.

751
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:05,764
A copy of the
senator's offer.

752
00:53:06,099 --> 00:53:09,393
This offer is
non-negotiable
and final.

753
00:53:10,103 --> 00:53:11,937

That's only part

There's beautiful. . .

760

Terns? Hmm.

761
00:53:41,134 --> 00:53:44,261
lf l help you, Clarice,
it will be "turns"
with us, too.

762
00:53:44,346 --> 00:53:45,387
Quid pro quo.

763
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:47,473
l tell you things,
you tell me things.

764
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:50,476
Not about this case,
though. About yourself.

765
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:53,229
Quid pro quo. Yes or no?

766
00:53:55,941 --> 00:53:57,608
Yes or no, Clarice?

767
00:53:57,692 --> 00:53:59,485
Poor little Catherine
is waiting.

768
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:02,029
Go, Doctor.

769
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,991
What is your worst
memory of childhood?

770
00:54:07,827 --> 00:54:09,453
The death of my father.

771
00:54:10,455 --> 00:54:13,540
Tell me about it.
And don't lie,
or l'll know.

772
00:54:14,542 --> 00:54:16,543
He was a town marshal,

773
00:54:17,879 --> 00:54:21,298
and one night
he surprised
two burglars

774
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:24,051
coming out of the back
of a drugstore.

775
00:54:25,011 --> 00:54:26,136
They shot him.

776
00:54:27,055 --> 00:54:29,014
Was he killed outright?

777
00:54:29,474 --> 00:54:31,976
No. He was very strong.

778
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:33,852
He lasted more than a month.

779
00:54:34,854 --> 00:54:37,481
My mother died
when l was very young,

780
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:41,402
so my father had become
the whole world to me,

781
00:54:41,486 --> 00:54:43,988
and when he left me,
l had nothing.

782
00:54:44,072 --> 00:54:45,823
l was ten years old.

783
00:54:46,825 --> 00:54:48,951
You're very frank, Clarice.

784
00:54:49,744 --> 00:54:53,747
l think it would
be quite something to
know you in private life.

785
00:54:56,543 --> 00:54:58,252
Quid pro quo, Doctor.

786
00:54:59,337 --> 00:55:01,630
So tell me about
Miss West Virginia.

787
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:03,716
Was she a large girl?

788
00:55:06,511 --> 00:55:07,636
Yes.

789
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:10,264
Big through the hips? Roomy?

790
00:55:10,348 --> 00:55:12,057
They all were.

791
00:55:12,225 --> 00:55:13,475
What else?

792
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:17,354
She had an object
deliberately inserted
into her throat.

793
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:20,357
Now, that hasn't
been made public yet.

794
00:55:20,442 --> 00:55:22,484
We don't know
what it means.

795
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:24,153
Was it a butterfly?

796
00:55:25,447 --> 00:55:27,406
Yes. A moth.

797
00:55:28,616 --> 00:55:32,745
Just like the one we found
in Benjamin Raspail's head
an hour ago.

798
00:55:34,247 --> 00:55:36,540
Why does he place
them there, Doctor?

799
00:55:37,292 --> 00:55:40,669
The significance
of the moth is change.

800
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:44,340
Caterpillar into
chrysalis or pupa,

801
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:47,092
and from thence into beauty.

802
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:50,346
Our Billy wants
to change, too.

803
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:53,307
There's no correlation
in literature

804
00:55:53,391 --> 00:55:55,017
between transsexualism
and violence.

805
00:55:55,101 --> 00:55:56,685
Transsexuals
are very passive. . .

806
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:58,354
Clever girl.

807
00:55:58,438 --> 00:56:00,314
You're so close to the way
you're gonna catch him.

808
00:56:00,398 --> 00:56:01,774
Do you realize that?

809
00:56:02,108 --> 00:56:03,484
No. Tell me why.

810
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:06,904
After your father's murder,
you were orphaned.

811
00:56:06,988 --> 00:56:08,447
What happened next?

812
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:16,455
l don't imagine
the answer is on those
second-rate shoes, Clarice.

813
00:56:17,248 --> 00:56:20,834
l went to live
with my mother's cousin
and her husband in Montana.

814
00:56:20,919 --> 00:56:22,586
They had a ranch.

815
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:24,546
Was it a cattle ranch?

816
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:26,006
Sheep and horses.

817
00:56:26,841 --> 00:56:28,467
How long did you live there?

818
00:56:29,302 --> 00:56:30,636
Two months.

819
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,054
Why so briefly?

820
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:33,680
l ran away.

821
00:56:33,973 --> 00:56:35,724
Why, Clarice?

822
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:38,060
Did the rancher make
you perform fellatio?

823
00:56:38,144 --> 00:56:40,187
Did he sodomize you?

824
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:43,732
No. He was a very decent man.

825
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:47,444
Quid pro quo, Doctor.

826
00:56:49,531 --> 00:56:52,032
Billy is not
a real transsexual.

827
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:54,284
But he thinks he is.
He tries to be.

828
00:56:54,369 --> 00:56:56,620
He's tried to be
a lot of things, l expect.

829
00:56:57,497 --> 00:56:58,747
And you said that
l was very close

830
00:56:58,832 --> 00:56:59,957
to the way
we would catch him.

831
00:57:00,041 --> 00:57:01,417
What did you mean, Doctor?

832
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:04,086
There are three major centers
for transsexual surgery.

833
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:08,632
Johns Hopkins,
the University of Minnesota,
and Columbus Medical Center.

834
00:57:08,716 --> 00:57:12,010
l wouldn't be surprised
if Billy had applied
for sex reassignment

835
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:15,013
at one or all of them
and been rejected.

836
00:57:16,141 --> 00:57:17,975
On what basis
would they reject him?

a criminal, Clarice.

He was made one through
years of systematic abuse.

841
00:57:30,947 --> 00:57:34,616
Billy hates his own
identity, you see,

842
00:57:34,701 --> 00:57:37,453
and he thinks that
makes him a transsexual.

843

You were ten years old.

You went to live with cousins

1062
01:10:35,606 --> 01:10:39,150
l went downstairs, outside.

1063
01:10:41,987 --> 01:10:43,988
l crept up into the barn.

1064
