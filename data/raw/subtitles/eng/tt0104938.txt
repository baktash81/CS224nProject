(Energetic music)
(Siren blaring)

3
00:00:13,055 --> 00:00:15,296
[Munchie] Hey where
are we going, to a fire?

4
00:00:17,226 --> 00:00:19,638
(Car revving)

5
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:21,886
Oh, I can hear a police escort!

6
00:00:21,897 --> 00:00:24,559
How sweet, I like that.

7
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:28,024

00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,768
(Tires screeching)

9
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,738
I love sirens, they
really get your attention!

10
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:33,776
Are we there yet?

11
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:37,743
(Tires screeching)
(Siren blaring)

12
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:38,952
(Laughing)

13
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:41,242
Hey, give us a drink there.

14
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:47,828

00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:50,167

(Tires screeching)

19
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:56,212
Sheesh. = huh?

20
00:00:56,223 --> 00:01:00,216
(Tires screeching) (Crashing)

21
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:02,764
[Munchie] Okay, okay, the joke is over.

22
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:04,602
Let me out of here right now or,

23
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:08,940
no more nice guy, get me, understand?

24
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:22,029
(Tires squealing)

25
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:22,995
I gotta tell you pal,

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,490
the last two weeks have been a ball.

27
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:26,457
I enjoyed myself as much as you did!

28
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:27,371
What laughs huh?

29
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:28,334
(Laughing)

30
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:29,338
Hello?

31
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:33,999

00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:40,839
That's a Roger command,
(Forlorn music)

35
00:01:40,851 --> 00:01:42,341
We're in place.

36
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:43,182
(Radio beeping) [Radio] Yokum 12

37
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:44,141

Roger dispatch we're

00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:52,236

42
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:54,979
(Engine revving)

43
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:55,990

00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:09,084
[Munchie] I got it, you're
having a surprise party

47
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:10,577
for me right?

48
00:02:10,589 --> 00:02:12,375
You shouldn't have gone
through all that trouble!

49
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:15,670
But, a party's a party, know what I mean?

50
00:02:19,181 --> 00:02:22,389
(Tires screeching)

51
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:25,304

(Door slamming)

59
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,036
Oh that was some ride!

60
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,656
You know what they say,
getting there is half the fun!

61
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:33,331
Okay party time, everybody
sing, one-two-three!

62
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:34,748

(Bell ringing)

71
00:05:57,274 --> 00:06:01,142
Now class, I'd like
you to turn to page 44

72
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:03,268
in your math assignment books right away.

73
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,736
As we discussed yesterday,

74
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:06,775
equivalent fractions are determined by

75
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:10,651
multiplying or dividing the
numerator and denominator.

76
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:13,153
So let's look at these
fractions on the board.

77
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:16,748
Now who can tell us
how we add 2/3 and 3/4?

78
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:19,618
Yes, Andrea?

79
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,540
(Charming music)

80
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:23,254
We can change the thirds and fourths

81
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:24,794
into equal denominations.

82
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,587
Thank you Andrea that's very good.

83
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:32,931
As you can see, I've
multiplied 3/4 by four,

84
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:35,846
equaling 8/12, and here,

85
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:40,723
I'm multiplying 1/4 by three.

86
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,395
Three. (Applauding)

87
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:45,940
(Restrained festive music)

88
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:52,401
Now, it is my honor to
read the name of the student,

89
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:56,530
whom you have chosen, as your
next student body president.

90
00:06:57,709 --> 00:06:59,449
Envelope please, thank you.

91
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:00,871
(Drum rolling)

92
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:02,210
And the winner is,

93
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,589
Gage dobson! (Cheering)

94
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:11,553
(Applauding) (Festive music)

95
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:30,405
Who can tell me the sum of 2/3 and 3/10?

96
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:33,616
The sum of 2/3 and 3/10!

97
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,905
(Suspenseful music) Gage?

98
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,745
Gage?

99
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:38,704
I accept!

100
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,869
I mean, could you repeat
the question please?

101
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:42,413
The problem on the board.

102
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:45,332
How can we arrive at a sum?

103
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,340
A sum.

104
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,631
(Bell ringing)

105
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:49,966
(Students chattering)

106
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,301
Now class, don't forget that your

107
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,670
fraction homework
assignments are due tomorrow!

108
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:01,897
Gage!

109
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:04,560
(Sighing)

110
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,899
Could you stay after class
for a moment, please?

111
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:09,405
Sure Mrs. blaylok.

112
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:15,858
= this is the third time

113
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,407
you haven't turned in
a homework assignment.

114
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:19,575
= t know.

115
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,994
I guess I'm just having
some trouble with fractions.

116
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:25,494
I know it's difficult for
you, being a transfer student.

117
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:29,669
New friends, new school, and
there's a period of adjustment.

118
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,632
But you've been here for two months now.

119
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:35,804
Unless your grades improve in
math I may have to fail you.

120
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:38,139
Do you understand that?

121
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,134
Yes Mrs. blaylok.

122
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:40,975
(Sighing)

123
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:42,560
All right that's all for now.

124
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:45,226
But remember I'm here after
school if you need any help.

125
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:46,643
= sure.

126
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:49,814
(Charming music)

127
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:51,311
Gage?

128
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:53,278
Have you made any friends here yet?

129
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:54,693
Oh, yeah.

130
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:55,736
Lots of 'em.

131
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:04,616
(Students chattering)

132
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,051
(Cash register bell ringing)

133
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:19,173
[Girl] See you guys later, bye, bye!

134
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:23,681
- Cool!
- Yeah that's totally cool.

135
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:28,306
- Yeah right.
- Yeah.

136
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:31,685
- What are you.
- I want to go in the ocean.

137
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:32,811
[Boy] Scott!

138
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,440
Who said you could sit here dobson?

139
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:39,158
I didn't know you needed a reservation.

140
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:40,527
(Giggling)

141
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:41,869
Comedian, Leon.

142
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:43,534
Yeah he's funny.

143
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:44,997
Funny looking.

144
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:48,789
No one sits at this
table, unless I want 'em to.

145
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:49,912
And I don't want you to.

146
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:53,248
Come on Ashton, what
difference does it make?

147
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,294
= dobson's a dweeb!

148
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:58,754
And people are known by
the company they keep.

149
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:00,881
Well in that case, maybe I should leave.

150
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:06,105
= she'll be back.

151
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,475
But you won't be!

152
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:13,443
Leon, show this gentleman
where he may eat his lunch.

153
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:16,858
(Chuckling)

154
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:25,702
(Splattering)
(Students laughing)

155
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:30,994
All right. (Suspenseful music)

156
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:34,088
Whose tray is this?

157
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:39,003
I said, whose tray is this?

158
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:39,968
Uh, principal Thornton?

159
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:42,510
I believe it belongs to
Gage dobson here sir.

160
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:45,930
Yeah, the new kid, dobson.

161
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:47,017
- But I...
- Dobson!

162
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:48,761
(Bell ringing)

163
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:49,773
Come here.

164
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:54,275
(Comically forlorn music)

165
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,666
(Rattling)

166
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:25,515
(Thornton laughing)

167
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:30,269
(Sighing)

168
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:31,103
Mr. Thornton, you gotta

169
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:31,937
believe me, I...
You didn't think

170
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:34,353
I'd know who did it.

171
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,601
Well young man, I've been watching you

172
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:38,569
ever since you transferred here!

173
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:41,736
And believe me, I don't like what I see!

174
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:44,359
You gotta believe me,
Leon dabbit threw it!

175
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,862
And you won't escape
retribution by blaming others!

176
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:50,331
I see I shall have to
make an example of you!

177
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:54,869
20 extra hours of study hall!

178
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:55,745
= oh no!

179
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:58,499
And, two demerits!

180
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,046
Whatever those are.

181
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:04,797
And Mark my words dobson,
I'll be watching you.

182
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,593
One more infraction and
(Suspenseful music)

183
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:08,182
Vou know what happens!

184
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:10,677
(Bell ringing)

185
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:15,773
Fire! (Guns firing)

186
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:16,777
Suspension!

187
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:20,729
(Poignant music)

188
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:24,403
(Door clattering)
(Students chattering)

189
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,820
Ketchup.

190
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:26,863
Only ketchup.

191
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:39,164
(Distant chuffing)

192
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:43,217
(Explosion booming)

193
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:48,136
(Clattering) (Poignant music)

194
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:49,924
Professor cruikshank!

195
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:51,096
Professor cruikshank where are you?

196
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:52,844
I'm here Gage!

197
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:53,685
(Coughing)

198
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:55,931
If I can only figure out where here is!

199
00:12:57,151 --> 00:13:00,188
(Coughing)

200
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:01,185
What happened?

201
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,152
(Sighing)

202
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:05,694
This is a lesson in
spontaneous combustion.

203
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:08,284
It seems that a faulty exhaust device

204
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:10,153
recirculated gasoline fumes

205
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:12,029
back through the intake manifold.

206
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,247
(Chuckling)

207
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:15,162
Added to this equation all you need is a

208
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:17,376
tiny little spark and kaba-room!

209
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:21,164
Eh, it was my fault!

210
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:23,382
I was so busy thinking,

211
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,633
that I didn't think
about what I was doing.

212
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,720
You were daydreaming.

213
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:31,685
= that too.

214
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:35,011
You know that's what
makes human beings unique,

215
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:38,140
the ability to think,
to dream, to imagine.

216
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:39,607
Reality is, is,

217
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:42,101
is only good for somebody who can't cope,

218
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:43,774
with imagination.

219
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:45,942
Do you think you'll ever
get this Jeep running?

220
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,942
This bucket of bolts, of course I will!

221
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:50,443
(Chuckling)

222
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:53,947
Then I'll have to think of
something to do with these hands.

223
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:57,075
You think the neighborhood
would object to a,

224
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:58,997
a new nuclear reactor here?

225
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:01,166
I, don't think that
would be a good idea.

226
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:03,289
Maybe not.

227
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:08,091
Well, so tell me, have you heard
from your father this week?

228
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:09,177
He's been really busy,

229
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:10,012
and with his new family and all.

230
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:11,381
- Uh-huh.
- He'll probably

231
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:13,724
call in someday. = uh-huh.

232
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:15,093
What about your research Grant?

233
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:16,594
Has the university called yet?

234
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:18,016
Not yet, but they will.

235
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:20,106
I told them unless they give me the Grant

236
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,724
to study ancient civilizations,

237
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:25,024
I shall resign my position
at the university.

238
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:26,316
Would you really quit?

239
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:29,111
No, but they don't
have to know that, no.

240
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:31,154
On the other hand it
might not be a bad idea

241
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:32,743
to get away from the university,

242
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:36,114
the longer I'm there, it
seems the less I know.

243
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,366
(Door clicking)

244
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:39,959
(Door slamming)
Take for example this

245
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:42,294
Dr. Carlisle over there.

246
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:46,962
This Dr. Carlisle injects little
animals with cancer cells.

247
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:50,211
And then, he cuts them open
to find out what killed them.

248
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:52,805
Now there doesn't seem
to be much logic to that.

249
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:54,598
Yeah.

250
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:55,637
But my mom seems to like him.

251
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:58,136
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah, well I gotta go.

252
00:14:58,147 --> 00:14:59,432
Tell me when you get it running!

253
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,270
= of course I will!

254
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:02,515
You'll be the first to go
for a test ride with me!

255
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:04,313
I'll see you later, okay?

256
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:09,029
You.

257
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,193
(Grunting) (Thumping)

258
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:11,236
- Hi mom.
- Hi honey.

259
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:13,235
- Hi Elliot.
- Hi guy!

260
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:14,452
How's it going?

261
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:16,195
Hey you make the football team yet?

262
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:17,663
I don't want to play football.

263
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:18,497
(Chuckling)

264
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:19,456
Sure you do!

265
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:23,499
Hey sports teach you teamwork,
discipline, competition!

266
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:25,997
Skills you're gonna need later in life!

267
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,293
I want you to go out there tomorrow

268
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:28,916
and try out for that team!

269
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,168
You know what honey, why don't you help

270
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,589
Elliot in with the groceries, okay?

271
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:32,597
Sure mom.

272
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:37,144
You know Gage,

273
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,223
I'm quite aware you and I
haven't really hit it off.

274
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:41,516
Now I know you feel like I'm

275
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:44,436
taking your mother away
from you, and your father...

276
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,435
Don't talk about my father.

277
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:48,653
Come on Gage, you gotta face the facts,

278
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:51,193
he just doesn't want you, or your mother.

279
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:56,278
And Cathy and I, well
we're gonna be married.

280
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:57,529
= she never told me!

281
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,620
(Laughing)

282
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,330
That's because I haven't asked her yet!

283
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:02,074
But I'm going to tomorrow night.

284
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:03,622
You know how she feels about me.

285
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:06,958
Hey!

286
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,376
Hey buddy but what's more important

287
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:10,045
is how you feel about me.

288
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:10,882
(Sighing)

289
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:11,887
You're a creep.

290
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:17,466
Did Gage seem a little upset to you?

291
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:18,717
= no more than usual.

292
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:19,968
You know Cathy you shouldn't let him spend

293
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,641
so much time with old cruikshank
across the street there.

294
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,855
That guy's the biggest
crackpot at the university!

295
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:27,976
He's a little eccentric
maybe, but he's harmless.

296
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,898
Remember we have a date tomorrow night.

297
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:32,813
Bring my appetite with me.

298
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,111
(Chuckling)

299
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:39,995
(Poignant music)

300
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:03,894
(Birds chirping)

301
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:17,446
Some day I'll be dead,
then they'll all be sorry.

302
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:20,445
(Somber organ music)

303
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:42,558
He was the cutest boy in school.

304
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,518
If he'd only spoken to me once even.

305
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:47,980
Now I'll never speak again.

306
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,779
I'm sorry I acted like
such a dreadful puke.

307
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:57,739
Actually I was merely compensating

308
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:00,234
for an over-active inferiority complex.

309
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:04,948
(Sobbing)

310
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:08,660
I threw his lunch tray against the wall

311
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:11,253
and now he's dead.

312
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:13,373
(Sobbing)

313
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:20,050
Please forgive us dear boy,

314
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:23,595
I'll, I'll take back those
20 hours of study hall.

315
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:25,093
= and the two demerits!

316
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,595
Yes, whatever those are.

317
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:34,645
Gage, I got arrested, for bigamy.

318
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:38,402
You mother recognized me
on America's most wanted.

319
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:42,197
And Gage, you were right.

320
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:45,029
I am a creep.

321
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:47,157
(Weeping)

322
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:53,128
(Weeping)

323
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,132
Gage,

324
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:59,510
if you can hear me, please forgive us son!

325
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:04,758
Oh, and by the way, here's that walkman

326
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:06,134
you wanted for your birthday.

327
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:10,054
(Sobbing) - Thanks mom!

328
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:11,397
I knew you'd get it someday!

329
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:16,102
I'm sorry sir, you'll have to be quiet!

330
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:17,694
You are dead, after all!

331
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:19,901
Sorry, I forgot.

332
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:24,155
(Hinges creaking)

333
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:27,530
(Thumping echoing)

334
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,702
(Birds chirping)

335
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:32,577
(Foreboding music)

336
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:40,551
(Rustling)

337
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:46,799
(Clattering)

338
00:20:16,507 --> 00:20:17,963
(Clunking) (Gasping)

339
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:18,797
(Sighing)

340
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:19,756
Ti wish I was dead!

341
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,250
[Munchie] To be or not to be!

342
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:23,674
To live in a box, or to make merry!

343
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:25,171
Party time, ariba!

344
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:28,303
- Who said that?
- Me, I did pal!

345
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,140
It's Mel

346
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:30,180
you want I should draw you a map?

347
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:31,973
Inside the box!

348
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:33,266
- Inside the box.
- Yeah.

349
00:20:33,274 --> 00:20:34,684
Right.

350
00:20:34,692 --> 00:20:36,307
This is one of those
hidden video shows, right?

351
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:37,899
- Wrong.
- Okay you got me,

352
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,518
where are the cameras?
No cameras,

353
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:41,816
no special effects, just little old me,

354
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:44,736
inside this little old box, get it?

355
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:46,154
How'd you get in there?

356
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:48,699
Long story pal, but right now

357
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:51,618
the secret word is open sesame!

358
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:54,037
- Who are you?
- Ah, listen pal,

359
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:55,909
you couldn't even pronounce my name,

360
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:56,876
but I'll tell you what.

361
00:20:56,881 --> 00:20:58,166
You can call me munchie.

362
00:20:58,174 --> 00:21:00,290
Hey, how 'bout pulling out that pin,

363
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:02,041
so I can get out of here?

364
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:03,508
- You won't hurt me?
- Hurt you?

365
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:04,342
(Chuckling)

366
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:05,882
Pal, I'm your new friend!

367
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:08,472
I help, I dazzle, I make better,

368
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:10,592
I'm friendly to a fault.

369
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:12,264
That's it, that's it! (Creaking)

370
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,852
Whoa!

371
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:14,686
Ooh,

372
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:15,850
just what I always wanted,
(Hinges creaking)

373
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:17,689
A room with a view.

374
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:18,978
(Laughing)

375
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:21,443
(Regal music)

376
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:26,615
(Fireworks hissing)

377
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:33,413
J; Hello my baby [
(Ragtime music)

378
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:37,330
J hello my honey, hello my ragtime gal 7

379
00:21:37,338 --> 00:21:39,420

380
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:42,586

I'm losing the crowd!

387
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:59,356
What'd I do?
(Fireworks crackling)

388
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,440
Mom!

389
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:01,729
Mom where are you?

390
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:03,523
Gage, where have you been,

391
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:05,817
and what have I told you
about coming home after dark?

392
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:08,316
Now your dinner is cold, and
I am not going to reheat it!

393
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,692
I know, but listen!

394
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:11,034
I was in this old abandoned mine,

395
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:13,279
and, there was this little creature,

396
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:15,872
and it jumped out of its
box and it started singing!

397
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:16,876
It sang?

398
00:22:18,212 --> 00:22:20,248
Gage, you know some day your daydreaming

399
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:22,963
may make you millions, but
right now all it's getting you

400
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:25,253
is not even a cold dinner, and bed.

401
00:22:25,261 --> 00:22:27,092
- But mom...
- Listen to me young man,

402
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:28,882
upstairs, now! (Patting)

403
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:30,504
(Sighing)

404
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:33,132
[Gage] Maybe I was
daydreaming, I liked the funeral.

405
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:34,143
= the funeral?

406
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:35,684
What funeral?

407
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:37,895
= never mind mom.

408
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:40,605
You just better keep on
watching America's most wanted!

409
00:22:42,987 --> 00:22:43,851
[Native American]
Whoo whoo whoo whoo whoo

410
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:45,103
whoo whoo whoo whoo whoo whoo!

411
00:22:45,114 --> 00:22:46,820
(Soldiers shouting)
(Guns firing)

412
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:49,611
What are you doing here?

413
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:51,984
Waiting for you pal, and I am famished.

414
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:55,238
Oh, what I could do to a
quiche Lorraine and a yoo-hoo.

415
00:22:55,249 --> 00:22:56,830
How'd you find me?

416
00:22:56,834 --> 00:22:58,699
Well I'm fast on my feet.

417
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:00,702
I followed you home pal, real simple.

418
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:03,876
Then, how did you get here before I did?

419
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:06,420
Magic pal, I'm a great magician.

420
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:07,837
In fact I'm so hungry,

421
00:23:07,845 --> 00:23:10,712
I can make a Turkey
disappear just like that.

422
00:23:11,849 --> 00:23:14,010
- What are you watching?
- Television,

423
00:23:14,018 --> 00:23:15,178
it used to be wonderful.

424
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:18,848
Now, I think there's just
too many darn reruns.

425
00:23:18,856 --> 00:23:20,266
(Knocking)

426
00:23:20,274 --> 00:23:22,981
(Magical popping)
(Chimes twinkling)

427
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:24,771
[Cathy] Gage?

428
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:25,778
Yeah?

429
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:28,027
(Sighing)

430
00:23:28,032 --> 00:23:30,318
Honey are you talking to yourself?

431
00:23:30,326 --> 00:23:33,068
Um, yeah I guess I was.

432
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,318
Well I'm still really upset with you

433
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:35,991
but I brought you something to eat.

434
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:39,239
(Crickets chirping)
Now as soon as you eat that

435
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:40,957
I want you to go right to bed okay?

436
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:43,922
Sure mom.

437
00:23:49,303 --> 00:23:50,588
Ti feel fine.

438
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:52,006
- You sure?
- Mhm.

439
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:53,220
Okay.

440
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:54,838
Goodnight Gage. - Goodnight.

441
00:23:59,021 --> 00:24:00,932
(Door thumping) - Hey pal!

442
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,146
Great! = hmm!

443
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:03,559
My mom thinks I'm losing my marbles,

444
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:05,023
and you won't even let her see you.

445
00:24:05,027 --> 00:24:06,267
(Pensive music)
You know where I come from

446
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:09,441
I'm just ordinary, I mean
ordinary, now my father,

447
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:12,406
oh, there was a guy, what a guy!

448
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:15,446
He had a pet dinosaur
that was paper trained!

449
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:16,284
(Laughing)

450
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,825
Those were the days, what laughs!

451
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:20,242
But times have changed!

452
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:22,206
Hey you've been so nice
to me I owe you one!

453
00:24:22,211 --> 00:24:25,044
What do you want, ask for it, anything!

454
00:24:25,047 --> 00:24:26,537
Don't matter, what do you need?

455
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:28,549
= what would I like?

456
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:33,881
I'd like to be popular,

457
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:36,926
I'd like mom not to
marry that creep Elliot,

458
00:24:36,934 --> 00:24:39,346
I'd like Andrea Kurtz to
know I was even alive,

459
00:24:39,353 --> 00:24:41,309
I'd like principal Thornton to get his,

460
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:42,177
and, (sighing)

461
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:43,804
I'd like Aston and Leon

462
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:45,807
to look like total idiots in
front of the entire school,

463
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:47,024
and I'd like to pass math.

464
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:48,858
No problem, consider it done.

465
00:24:51,407 --> 00:24:53,022
And right now, I'd rather have a

466
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:55,069
hot pepperoni pizza than those leftovers.

467
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:57,238
Hot pepperoni pizza,
you know something kid,

468
00:24:57,246 --> 00:24:58,656
we could be friends.

469
00:24:58,664 --> 00:25:00,200
(Laughing)

470
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:02,368
It's no use, mom would
never let me call out.

471
00:25:02,376 --> 00:25:03,206
= call out?

472
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,121
Kid, don't make me laugh!

473
00:25:05,129 --> 00:25:07,165
(Magical popping) (Whooshing)

474
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:08,127
I'm hot!

475
00:25:08,132 --> 00:25:10,339
One large pepperoni pizza coming up!

476
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:12,924
In 30 seconds or you get it free!

477
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:16,887
(Chuckles)
Mozzarella, abracadabra.

478
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:19,347
(Perky music)

479
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:23,184
Oh boy!

480
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:24,553

481
00:25:24,565 --> 00:25:26,226

00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:27,973

483

(Speaking foreign language)

484
00:25:30,154 --> 00:25:31,189
Magnifico!

485
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:33,027
What a super special for two.

486
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:35,114
(Chuckling)

487
00:25:35,117 --> 00:25:37,824
(Eerie whirring)

488
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:42,121
What's goin' on?

489
00:25:42,124 --> 00:25:43,830
Come on! - Yeehaw!

490
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:45,665
(Magical whooshing)
(Chimes ringing)

491
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:47,079
Woohoo!

492
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:49,328
Nobody steals one of my specials!

493
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:54,254
(Pizza giggling) (Perky music)

494
00:25:55,429 --> 00:25:56,418
(Screaming) (Whooshing)

495
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:57,590
Can't get away from Mel!

496
00:25:57,598 --> 00:25:59,384
Hey you can't leave-a

497

498
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:03,308
(Chef mumbling)

499
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:05,098
Let's try Chinese instead!

500
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:09,098
(Whooshing) (Mumbling)

501
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:10,109
Mozzarella.

502
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:13,940
Whoa check it out!

503
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:15,437
(Chef grumbling)

504
00:26:15,449 --> 00:26:17,155

(Siren wailing)
(Tires screeching)

506
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:25,372
[Officer] All right

Leave the driving to us.
(Chimes ringing)

509
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:35,628
(Pizza giggling)
(Tires screeching)

510
00:26:35,636 --> 00:26:39,003
Arriba, arriba!
(Magical whirring)

511
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:42,131
I can smell it from

512
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:43,348
(Perky music)

513
00:26:43,352 --> 00:26:44,762
(Whooshing)

514
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:46,010
(Heavenly music)

515
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,636
It's possible.

516
00:26:47,648 --> 00:26:52,517
(Magical whirring)
(Chimes ringing)

517
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:54,564
Yeehaw! (Dramatic music)

518
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:56,732
Whoa, an unidentified flying pizza!

519
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:59,447
And you don't have to tip the driver!

520
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:01,942
Smells good, let's dig in!

521
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:03,285
= anchovies?

522
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:04,528
T hate anchovies.

523
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:06,496
Just eat around 'em, I'm starving.

524
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:08,790
Can you make anything fly?

525
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:11,001
I have a little trouble
with alphabet soup.

526
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:13,169
(Chuckling)

527
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:14,834
Oh and I mimic voices!

528
00:27:14,842 --> 00:27:16,548
You should hear my Clark gable.

529
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:17,382
(Crickets chirping)

530
00:27:17,386 --> 00:27:18,216
Who?

531
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:20,962
Oh, I guess I'm gonna
have to update my material.

532
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:22,008
I don't get it.

533
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:23,380
If you have all these magical powers,

534
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:25,678
I mean, how come you
couldn't get out of that box?

535
00:27:25,686 --> 00:27:27,551
Look, if I'm trapped inside something

536
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:29,519
I just can't say hocus-pocus and escape,

537
00:27:29,523 --> 00:27:31,138
I just have limits that's all!

538
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:34,062
Everybody's got limits, gimme a break.

539
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:35,525
How long were you in there?

540
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:38,487
A long time, a long, long time.

541
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:41,448
Put it this way pal, if I
was making house payments,

542
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:43,237
I'd own the sucker by now!

543
00:27:43,245 --> 00:27:44,325
Where's the tabasco?

544
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:47,700
(Contented music)

545
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:49,198
(Growling)

546
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:50,369
Come to poppa! I

547
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:54,871
(munching) (Chuckling)

548
00:27:56,258 --> 00:27:57,122
(Burping)

549
00:27:57,134 --> 00:27:58,340
Sorry, slipped out.

550
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:00,334
Can't believe we ate that entire pizza.

551
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:02,006
Hey how about some blueberry cheesecake?

552
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:04,881
It doesn't travel well,
but I do love a challenge!

553
00:28:04,892 --> 00:28:05,722
(Sighing)

554
00:28:05,726 --> 00:28:06,715
= t don't think so.

555
00:28:06,727 --> 00:28:07,716
= come to think of it

556
00:28:07,728 --> 00:28:09,764
I got enough gas to drive to Cleveland!

557
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:11,932
Hey, where you gonna sleep tonight?

558
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,898
Pal, any place is an
improvement over that box!

559
00:28:14,902 --> 00:28:18,144
Actually, I was hoping to
sort of bunk down with you!

560
00:28:18,155 --> 00:28:19,065
= sure.

561
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:21,358
You're gonna have to
make your own bed though.

562
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:22,822
Don't worry about me pal.

563
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:24,987
Hammer, nails, I come prepared.

564
00:28:24,995 --> 00:28:27,202
(Laughing)

565
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:34,000
I gotta update my material.

566
00:28:37,758 --> 00:28:40,044
(Snoring)

567
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:42,759
(Charming music)

568
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:46,922
(Snoring)

569
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:02,104
Goodnight munchie.

570
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:08,486
(Snoring)

571
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,005
(Pleasant music)

572
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:27,925
(Knocking)

573
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:28,888
Better shake a leg Gage

574
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:30,678
or you won't have time for breakfast.

575
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:33,142
(Door thumping) (Chimes ringing)

576
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:35,182
(Sighing)

577
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,225
Coming mom.

578
00:29:41,697 --> 00:29:43,312
(Suspenseful music)

579
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:44,323
Munchie?

580
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:54,494
Munchie?

581
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:55,501
Munchie?

582
00:29:58,171 --> 00:29:59,707
Not even a goodbye.

583
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:04,625
(Students chattering)

584
00:30:17,107 --> 00:30:19,814
(Romantic music)

585
00:30:51,308 --> 00:30:54,425
(Students chattering)

586
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:59,179
(Gulping)

587
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:00,271
Thank you Leon.

588
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:03,563
Now that I have your
undivided attention dobson,

589
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:06,152
there are a few points I'd
like to impress on you.

590
00:31:06,156 --> 00:31:08,067
I'd listen to him if I were you.

591
00:31:08,075 --> 00:31:11,158
First, stay away from Andrea Kurtz.

592
00:31:11,161 --> 00:31:14,369
She's my girl, for as long as
I may want her, understood?

593
00:31:14,373 --> 00:31:16,659
- Understood!
- Second!

594
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:18,702
Andrea and myself will be performing at

595
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:21,076
the talent contest this afternoon.

596
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:22,703
Somehow you got yourself appointed

597
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:24,796
stage manager for this event.

598
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:28,008
You foul up one time
during my performance,

599
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:29,672
and I let Leon loose on you.

600
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,465
I like to break things.

601
00:31:31,473 --> 00:31:33,964
He usually starts with the legs.

602
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:36,136
I trust I've made myself clear?

603
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:38,260
You may nod your head in agreement.

604
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:39,681
Thank you Leon.

605
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:42,647
Let us proceed to our first class.

606
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:52,490
(Cheerful music)

607
00:31:52,494 --> 00:31:53,529
So pal I'm ready!

608
00:31:53,537 --> 00:31:55,152
Where's cheerleader practice?

609
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:56,619
(Bell ringing)
What are you doing here?

610
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:57,738
I missed your face pal.

611
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:58,579
(Chuckling)

612
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,289
No, what are you doing here at school?

613
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:01,999
I'm here at school because we got a

614
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:03,959
long list of things that's gotta be done,

615
00:32:03,964 --> 00:32:06,171
and that's my problem,
I take it that those

616
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:08,506
are the guys that you're
having trouble with?

617
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:10,466
Yeah, Ashton and Leon.

618
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,927
I don't think I like
the way they talk to you!

619
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,762
You know what they say,
the bigger they are,

620
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,176
the harder they fall!

621
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:18,470
No, the bigger they
are the harder you fall!

622
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:20,434
Hey, let's not quibble over details,

623
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:23,272
besides, I rely totally on cunning,

624
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:26,642
ruthlessness, and sheer animal instinct!

625
00:32:27,737 --> 00:32:28,852
- W-what do you mean?
- Listen pal,

626
00:32:28,864 --> 00:32:31,355
anyone who's been to a lingerie sale

627
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:34,824
at jcpenny knows exactly
what I mean, but I digress.

628
00:32:34,828 --> 00:32:37,285
I gotta take care of
your math grades, bye!

629
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:38,119
But... (Magical popping)

630
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:39,784
(Chimes ringing)

631
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:42,658
(Suspenseful music)

632
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:47,629
(Keyboard clacking)
(Telephone ringing)

633
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:56,843
(Playfully furtive music)
(Munchie chuckling)

634
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:01,513
(Whistling)

635
00:33:03,607 --> 00:33:06,974
(Keyboard clacking)

636
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:08,976
(Chimes ringing) Oh miss Laurel,

637
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:11,444
may I see you in my
office a moment please?

638
00:33:11,448 --> 00:33:13,564
I'll be right there Mr. Thornton!

639
00:33:20,457 --> 00:33:21,822
(Furtive music) = look at this!

640
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:24,415
They hey hey, they've come a long way

641
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:25,659
since I invented univac.

642
00:33:26,922 --> 00:33:28,662
= you called me Mr. Thornton?

643
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:34,463
No, but it's always
good to see you, Marilyn.

644
00:33:34,471 --> 00:33:36,928
(Saucy music)

645
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:40,924
Okay, here we go,
(Keyboard clacking)

646
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:43,678
Let's see what kind of
grades this kid's got.

647
00:33:45,482 --> 00:33:47,188
(Bell ringing) C, b, d.

648
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:48,022
(Chuckling)

649
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:50,859
Oh no, I think we can do better than that.

650
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,318
(Chuckling)

651
00:33:52,322 --> 00:33:53,402
Here we go.

652
00:33:55,492 --> 00:33:59,110
Right, abracadabra, thank you!
(Chimes ringing)

653
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,985
[Marilyn] I could have
sworn you buzzed me.

654
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:03,158
- Hey, what's going on here?
- Marilyn, I always get

655
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:04,622
a buzz out of you!

656
00:34:04,626 --> 00:34:08,369
But Mr. Thornton, 1
distinctly heard you call me.

657
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,380
= Mr. Thornton.

658
00:34:10,632 --> 00:34:12,748
Must we be so, formal?

659
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:16,381
I should go back to my office.

660
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:19,004
I can't tell you what it's
been like these past few weeks,

661
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:22,007
you, sitting out there every day and me,

662
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:26,978
so close, and yet so far, from paradise!

663
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:29,355
I gotta share this with somebody!

664
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,692
But I thought we
agreed we couldn't go on!

665
00:34:32,696 --> 00:34:35,062
I know, I know, we
both have our positions

666
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:36,609
in the community but I don't care about

667
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:40,985
anyone or anything
except you, bunny-cakes!

668
00:34:40,996 --> 00:34:43,908
Oh, that's not fair!

669
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:45,780
You know I can't resist you when you call

670
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:48,499
(slide whistle descending)
Me bunny-cakes, snooky-poo!

671
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:52,746
Then you do still care, lovey-lumps?

672
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:56,041
[Marilyn] Oh lamby-kins.

673
00:34:57,012 --> 00:34:58,502
(Lips smacking)

674
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:00,378
[Thornton] Honey muffin!

675
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:02,301
[Marilyn] Snuggy bear!

676
00:35:02,309 --> 00:35:04,140
(Lips smacking)

677
00:35:04,144 --> 00:35:05,759
Angel thighs!

678
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:06,850
(Lips smacking) Class I want you

679
00:35:06,855 --> 00:35:08,720
to go over these problems while I'm gone

680
00:35:08,732 --> 00:35:10,097
and remember, no talking!

681
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:13,851
[Thornton] My little summer squash!

682
00:35:13,862 --> 00:35:16,194
(Lips smacking) - Pumpkin nose!

683
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:18,358
(Laughing) (Squealing)

684
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:20,482
[Thornton] Strudel lips!

685
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:24,907
= gotta be munchie!

686
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:29,164
[Marilyn] Lamby-kins!

687
00:35:29,169 --> 00:35:31,501
(Hinges creaking) Honey muffin!

688
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:32,664
(Ooh! Ps smacking)

689
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:33,957
[Marilyn] Poopsie-doodlle!

690
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:37,336
(Throat clearing)

691
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:39,380
(Coughing)

692
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:40,923
Mrs. blaylok!

693
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:43,717
It is customary to knock
before entering my office!

694
00:35:43,725 --> 00:35:46,137
I have certain rights to privacy you know!

695
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:48,886
Well none that you've been exercising!

696
00:35:48,897 --> 00:35:52,105
I was just helping miss Laurel,

697
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:54,144
put in her contact lenses.

698
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:57,861
I hope you haven't
misconstrued this little scene.

699
00:35:57,864 --> 00:36:00,981
No, but I can't speak
for the entire school.

700
00:36:02,911 --> 00:36:06,119
And you have been broadcasting
to every classroom!

701
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:07,237
= t did what?

702
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:09,113
(Dramatic music)

703
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:10,956
It can't be I.

704
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,291
Every word we've said?

705
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:16,003
That's right, snookie-poo!

706
00:36:17,092 --> 00:36:19,959
(Depressing music)

707
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:25,964
(Whistling) (Chuckling)

708
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:28,682
Yeah, so long snookie-poo.

709
00:36:28,687 --> 00:36:29,767
(Chuckling)

710
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:32,228
(Chimes ringing) (Whistling)

711
00:36:32,232 --> 00:36:34,939
(Pleasant music)

712
00:36:39,948 --> 00:36:41,734
(Chimes ringing)
Well, don't you ever

713
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:43,322
wash these out?

714
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:45,988
I wasn't expecting visitors in there.

715
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:47,781
Well, I took care of your grades,

716
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:50,030
and that stuffed shirt Thornton.

717
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,622
Now the fun really starts!

718
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:52,456
(Chuckling)

719
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,370
Look, I know you're trying to help,

720
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:56,040
but if anything goes wrong, I'm
the one who gets in trouble!

721
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:59,210
Relax pal, everything is copacetic!

722
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:00,127
Just be cool!

723
00:37:00,135 --> 00:37:03,298
Uh-oh, time for me to make
like Gabriel and blow.

724
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:04,134
(Chuckling)

725
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:06,346
(Slamming)

726
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:18,941
(Tense music)

727
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:23,608
(Whip cracking)

728
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:24,822
What'd you do that for?

729
00:37:24,826 --> 00:37:27,613
"Cause I wanted to,
what's it to 'va dobson?

730
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:28,951
= well.

731
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:30,536
That's right, nothing.

732
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:32,788
[Munchie] I didn't
think you did anything

733
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:35,329
without asking your boyfriend first.

734
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:36,792
Shut up!

735
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:37,785
Just shut up!

736
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:40,459
You think I'm Ashton's
flunky or something?

737
00:37:40,467 --> 00:37:42,128
The idea never crossed my mind!

738
00:37:42,135 --> 00:37:43,625
= well make sure it doesn't!

739
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:45,217
Now I don't want to hear
another word from you,

740
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:46,301
understand, dweeb?

741
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:49,430
[Munchie] Stooge.

742
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:51,140
What was that?

743
00:37:51,144 --> 00:37:52,304
(Knocking)

744
00:37:52,312 --> 00:37:53,893
Nothing, I didn't say anything!

745
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:57,680
[Munchie] Kiss ass.

746
00:37:57,692 --> 00:37:59,307
(Knocking)

747
00:37:59,319 --> 00:38:00,434
Why you little...

748
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:02,857
(Metallic slamming) Ar!

749
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:05,697
You hit me, you little twerp you hit me!

750
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:06,906
I never touched you, I swear!

751
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:07,899
(Suspenseful music)
(Doors clattering)

752
00:38:07,911 --> 00:38:11,369
You are gonna be sorry you were ever born!

753
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:12,202
= Geronimo!

754
00:38:12,207 --> 00:38:14,414
(Water splashing)

755
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:16,829
[Leon] I can't see, I'm blind!

756
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:19,373
(Chuckling)

757
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,665
(Brakes squealing)

758
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:21,503
(Whistling) (Grunting)

759
00:38:21,508 --> 00:38:26,047
(Thumping) (Chuckling)

760
00:38:27,806 --> 00:38:30,218
Okay kid, I've evened up the odds.

761
00:38:30,225 --> 00:38:31,556
The ball's in your court!

762
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:33,766
(Slamming)

763
00:38:38,358 --> 00:38:41,270
I am gonna kill,

764
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:42,277
you.

765
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:45,987
(Tense music)

766
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:10,261
(Fist thudding) (Screaming)

767
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,727
(Shower spewing)

768
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:23,273
(Clapping) (Cheering)

769
00:39:23,278 --> 00:39:25,519
All right, break it up!

770
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:27,191
Guys get changed for class,

771
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:28,734
Gage we gotta talk!

772
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:33,030
Now look, we both know that
dabbit's been asking for this

773
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:34,698
for a long time but you know the rules,

774
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:36,116
no fighting in the locker room, right?

775
00:39:36,124 --> 00:39:37,284
Yes sir.

776
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:39,157
All right I'm not gonna
write you up this time,

777
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:40,783
but if principal Thornton
gets ahold of this

778
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:42,535
you know it's gonna be bad news.

779
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:44,083
So what else is hew?

780
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:45,375
All right, go get changed for class,

781
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:46,873
I'll write you up a hall pass.

782
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,220
Hey Gage.

783
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:53,884
Why don't you try out for
the football team on Monday?

784
00:39:53,892 --> 00:39:55,007
= t don't like football.

785
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,555
That's a shame, it
looks like our star player

786
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:02,104
(cheerful music)

787
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:04,190
(Water splashing)
(Whimsical music)

788
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:06,400
(Groaning)

789
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:13,946
(Peppy accordion music)

790
00:40:21,336 --> 00:40:24,373
(Audience chuckling)

791
00:40:26,299 --> 00:40:28,540
[Munchie] Greetings
and salutations my lord.

792
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:29,836
(Chuckling)

793
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:31,084
Hi pal!

794
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:32,585
What are you doing here?

795
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:34,462
Look, if you get me in another fight...

796
00:40:34,474 --> 00:40:36,715
Maintain your composure dear boy,

797
00:40:36,726 --> 00:40:38,967
fear not, I have no intention of

798
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:41,845
turning this cultural
event into a brouhaha!

799
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:44,142
In point of fact, I am here to witness

800
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:46,311
a performance of my play!

801
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:47,434
Your play?

802
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:50,152
Romeo and Juliet was
written by Shakespeare.

803
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:51,896
A common misconception,

804
00:40:51,908 --> 00:40:54,149
according to an unimpeachable source,

805
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,742
namely myself, William
Shakespeare could not

806
00:40:56,746 --> 00:40:58,953
compose a shopping list without my help!

807
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:00,948
Well I don't care who wrote what,

808
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:02,449
just don't get into any trouble, okay?

809
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:05,372
Fear not my lord, I hereby swear,

810
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:08,247
to conduct myself with
a maximum of decorum.

811
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:09,087
(Laughing)

812
00:41:09,092 --> 00:41:14,052
(Magical popping) (Whooshing)

813
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:18,635
(Applause) (Shouting)

814
00:41:18,643 --> 00:41:19,678
(Booing)

815
00:41:19,686 --> 00:41:24,225
Thank you melody, for another,
memorable accordion solo.

816
00:41:24,232 --> 00:41:26,644
[Boy] Hey snookie-poo,
how's bunny-cakes?

817
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:27,481
(Laughing) - All right,

818
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:28,770
a little less noise there!

819
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:34,356
And now, to conclude today's assembly,

820
00:41:34,367 --> 00:41:35,948
a special treat,

821
00:41:35,952 --> 00:41:38,694
the balcony scene from Romeo and Juliet,

822
00:41:38,705 --> 00:41:41,663
performed by two of our
most promising students,

823
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:44,499
Ashton huwit, and Andrea Kurtz.

824
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:48,461
The curtain please! (Applauding)

825
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:52,332
("Greensleeves" by Henry viii)

826
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:57,003
= but soft!

827
00:41:57,015 --> 00:41:59,347
What light through yonder window breaks?

828
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:04,435
(Glass shattering) (Laughing)

829
00:42:04,439 --> 00:42:06,270
Ask and ye shall get.

830
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:13,319
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.

831
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:16,485
Arise, fair sun, and
kill the envious moon.

832
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:22,533
(Glass shattering) (Laughing)

833
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:26,119
Good enough for you bubala?

834
00:42:26,127 --> 00:42:28,413
(Screaming)

835
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:33,005
See how she leans her
cheek, upon her hand!

836
00:42:33,009 --> 00:42:35,921
Oh that I was a glove upon that hand,

837
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:37,919
- whoops!
- So I might touch that cheek!

838
00:42:39,182 --> 00:42:40,012
(Whistling) (Clanking)

839
00:42:40,016 --> 00:42:42,223
(Laughing)

840
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:54,276
Oh Romeo, Romeo!

841
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:57,279
Wherefore art thou Romeo?

842
00:42:58,284 --> 00:43:02,277
With love's light wings
did I o'er perch these walls.

843
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:05,451
For stony limits cannot hold love out.

844
00:43:05,458 --> 00:43:06,868
(Audience snickering)

845
00:43:06,876 --> 00:43:07,911
Ipso-facto,

846
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:09,750
(magical jingling) Pantso-off-o!

847
00:43:09,754 --> 00:43:14,714
(Cloth ripping) (Laughing)

848
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:27,810
Close the curtain, close the curtain!

849
00:43:27,814 --> 00:43:28,803
The scene isn't over yet!

850
00:43:28,815 --> 00:43:29,930
= I'll decide when it's over!

851
00:43:29,941 --> 00:43:30,941
Close the curtain!

852
00:43:33,194 --> 00:43:35,526
(Laughing)

853
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:37,862
Get those kids to the dressing room.

854
00:43:39,325 --> 00:43:41,441
Well yesterday was bad,

855
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:44,410
but today was a real
red-letter day for you, dobson!

856
00:43:45,373 --> 00:43:46,829
I don't know how you did it,

857
00:43:46,833 --> 00:43:48,915
but you managed to change your grades,

858
00:43:48,918 --> 00:43:51,705
beat up Leon daggit and
arrange that little,

859
00:43:51,712 --> 00:43:53,748
incident in my office.

860
00:43:53,756 --> 00:43:55,963
And when I can prove your responsibility

861
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:59,050
in these matters, it'll
be my personal pleasure,

862
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:02,011
to have you expelled
from school, permanently.

863
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:06,549
(Sorrowful music)

864
00:44:06,561 --> 00:44:08,927
Well pal, do I take care of ya,

865
00:44:08,938 --> 00:44:12,226
or do I take care of ya?

866
00:44:12,233 --> 00:44:13,598
Yeah you took care of things all right.

867
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:15,850
Thanks to you I'm gonna
get expelled from school!

868
00:44:15,862 --> 00:44:16,647
(Sighing)

869
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:17,939
Look, I know you're trying to help,

870
00:44:17,947 --> 00:44:20,154
but you're just making things worse!

871
00:44:20,158 --> 00:44:21,147
But I haven't helped you with

872
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:22,740
your mother's creepy boyfriend!

873
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:24,279
And, what about the lovely,

874
00:44:24,287 --> 00:44:25,117
(whistling)

875
00:44:25,121 --> 00:44:26,611
Andrea?

876
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:27,452
(Sighing)

877
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:29,037
Look you can help me
by leaving me alone.

878
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:31,532
If I'm gonna foul up I'd
rather do it by myself.

879
00:44:31,544 --> 00:44:32,499
Why don't you go back to your box

880
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:33,993
and find yourself a new friend?

881
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:36,336
Hey!

882
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:37,705
Where'd everybody go?

883
00:44:37,717 --> 00:44:38,752
Hey pal, pal!

884
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:45,012
(Scraping) (Poignant music)

885
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:57,100
(Professor cruikshank singing)

886
00:45:09,749 --> 00:45:11,910
(Chimes jingling)

887
00:45:11,918 --> 00:45:13,579
(Knocking)

888
00:45:13,586 --> 00:45:15,827
- Who is it?
- It's Gage!

889
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:18,420
Gage my friend, come on in!

890
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:23,384
(Door clattering)
(Hinges creaking)

891
00:45:27,516 --> 00:45:28,676
(Clunking)

892
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:33,223
Gage, Gage, what are
you schlepping in here?

893
00:45:33,231 --> 00:45:35,517
I was hoping you could tell me.

894
00:45:35,524 --> 00:45:37,230
It's something I found.

895
00:45:37,235 --> 00:45:38,475
Where did you find this?

896
00:45:39,528 --> 00:45:40,528
This is incredible!

897
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:42,815
= you mean it's valuable?

898
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:45,781
It's not only valuable,
it is invaluable!

899
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:50,778
Was there something in here?

900
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:53,122
I know you're not
gonna believe this but,

901
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:56,037
there was this little creature in there.

902
00:45:56,045 --> 00:45:57,455
(Gasping)

903
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:59,670
Don't move, you stay
right there, don't move!

904
00:45:59,674 --> 00:46:02,416
Don't breath, don't
breath, and don't move!

905
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:05,168
Just stay right there,
don't do anything at all,

906
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:08,046
don't do anything, here, here, here, here!

907
00:46:08,057 --> 00:46:09,297
Let me show you something!

908
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:12,675
Did it look like this?

909
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:16,773
= that's him!

910
00:46:18,359 --> 00:46:19,724
[Professor] And, and this?

911
00:46:21,237 --> 00:46:22,237
That, that too!

912
00:46:22,947 --> 00:46:24,107
How about this?

913
00:46:26,075 --> 00:46:28,361
- Is he that old?
- He's way older than that!

914
00:46:28,369 --> 00:46:30,985
Do you, do you, do you
know what you've found?

915
00:46:30,997 --> 00:46:31,827
I just want to get rid of him,

916
00:46:31,831 --> 00:46:34,368
before my entire life goes down the drain.

917
00:46:34,375 --> 00:46:35,364
You talked with him?

918
00:46:35,376 --> 00:46:36,866
(Sighing) = yeah.

919
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:38,663
He keeps calling me pal.

920
00:46:38,671 --> 00:46:39,671
= pal.

921
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:44,586
Could, could you introduce him to me?

922
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:47,585
I don't know, I told him to get lost.

923
00:46:47,596 --> 00:46:50,429
But, I have a feeling 1
haven't seen the last of him.

924
00:46:50,433 --> 00:46:52,264
Well, do the best you can.

925
00:46:52,268 --> 00:46:53,178
In the meantime,

926
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:56,552
can, can I keep the box here
so I can study these symbols?

927
00:46:56,564 --> 00:46:57,394
= sure.

928
00:46:57,398 --> 00:46:59,559
I mean, it's his box.

929
00:46:59,567 --> 00:47:02,024
And, if he wants it back,
I'll send him over to get it.

930
00:47:02,028 --> 00:47:04,815
Yes, yes, that would be
fine, that would be fine!

931
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:07,859
(Door creaking)

932
00:47:07,867 --> 00:47:09,152
(Gasping)

933
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:12,527
I have about two or three million
questions I could ask him.

934
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:15,701
(Perky cheerful music)

935
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:22,711
(Whirling)

936
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:29,464
Hey, sometimes you got to help people,

937
00:47:29,472 --> 00:47:31,258
in spite of themselves!

938
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:33,802
(Clanking)

939
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:36,300
(Door shutting)

940
00:47:36,312 --> 00:47:37,301
Hey mom!

941
00:47:37,313 --> 00:47:38,519
It looks like you're making a real dinner.

942
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:40,478
Well I have actually been known

943
00:47:40,483 --> 00:47:42,144
to cook on occasion you know.

944
00:47:42,151 --> 00:47:44,312
Yeah, when dad was here.

945
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:45,150
(Doorbell ringing) - Oh honey,

946
00:47:45,154 --> 00:47:46,564
I think that's Elliot, would you get that?

947
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:47,857
I'm gonna bast the chicken.

948
00:47:53,079 --> 00:47:54,444
Hey guy!

949
00:47:54,455 --> 00:47:55,786
Make that football team yet?

950
00:47:56,749 --> 00:47:58,831
No, but I decked the star quarterback.

951
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:02,122
Great, hey, listen Gage,
got a little favor to ask you.

952
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:04,085
Want me to get lost, right?

953
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:05,671
(Chuckling)

954
00:48:05,674 --> 00:48:07,460
Well I wouldn't put
it exactly like that.

955
00:48:07,468 --> 00:48:09,379
But I would like to be
alone with your mother

956
00:48:09,387 --> 00:48:12,504
for a little while, I have
something very important

957
00:48:12,515 --> 00:48:14,221
t want to discuss with her.

958
00:48:14,225 --> 00:48:16,216
Don't I have anything to say about it?

959
00:48:16,227 --> 00:48:18,684
Look Gage, I'm gonna be your new father

960
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:20,473
whether you like it or not.

961
00:48:20,481 --> 00:48:22,597
Now you can either be on my team,

962
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:24,473
or you can be my opponent.

963
00:48:24,485 --> 00:48:25,485
The choice is yours.

964
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:28,560
No, the choice is mom's.

965
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:29,402
(Sighing)

966
00:48:29,407 --> 00:48:30,407
Hi.

967
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:34,032
Well, dinner will be ready in 20 minutes.

968
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:35,651
I'm glad to see you two
getting along so well.

969
00:48:35,663 --> 00:48:38,405
Well Gage and I are just
having a little male bonding.

970
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:41,198
Champagne?

971
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:44,293
85 bucks a bottle babe,
and worth every penny of it.

972
00:48:45,714 --> 00:48:47,045
Mom?

973
00:48:47,049 --> 00:48:48,835
I'm not really that hungry,
I'm going to go upstairs

974
00:48:48,843 --> 00:48:49,958
and finish some homework.

975
00:48:49,969 --> 00:48:51,459
Well, are you feeling okay, honey?

976
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:54,382
Yeah I'm fine, I'll eat later.

977
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:55,505
= it'll be cold.

978
00:48:55,516 --> 00:48:58,929
It's okay, kinda getting
use to it that way.

979
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:01,973
(Footsteps thudding)

980
00:49:04,859 --> 00:49:06,440
Sometimes I worry about him.

981
00:49:06,444 --> 00:49:08,309
Oh, he'll be just fine.

982
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:10,777
What he needs is a man's influence.

983
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:12,317
= well his father wasn't much of a father

984
00:49:12,324 --> 00:49:14,030
but Gage loved him.

985
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:16,446
Now, that's all in the past.

986
00:49:16,454 --> 00:49:18,695
You should be more
concerned about the future.

987
00:49:18,706 --> 00:49:20,242
And what I'm looking
forward to is that meal

988
00:49:20,249 --> 00:49:22,831
you've been promising me
for the past two weeks.

989
00:49:22,835 --> 00:49:24,575
I hope you enjoy it.

990
00:49:24,587 --> 00:49:25,667
I only do this sort of thing

991
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:27,753
about once every leap year.

992
00:49:27,756 --> 00:49:28,586
(Giggling)

993
00:49:28,591 --> 00:49:31,628
Think I better go in the
kitchen and see how it's going.

994
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:33,921
Well in the meantime
I'll just stay out here

995
00:49:33,929 --> 00:49:35,385
and set the proper ambience.

996
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:37,505
(Kissing)

997
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:40,849
(Whistling)

998
00:49:40,853 --> 00:49:44,141
Standby for operation dinner storm.

999
00:49:44,148 --> 00:49:46,434
(Whistling)

1000
00:49:49,069 --> 00:49:49,899
(Clicking)

1001
00:49:49,904 --> 00:49:51,019
With a tweet, with a tweety.

1002
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:53,146
(Giggling) (Twinkling)

1003
00:49:53,157 --> 00:49:55,773
(Wobbling)

1004
00:49:55,784 --> 00:49:58,321
(Gentle music)

1005
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:04,032
(Orchestral music)

1006
00:50:04,043 --> 00:50:06,034
(Static buzzing)

1007
00:50:06,045 --> 00:50:09,333
(Gentle romantic music)

1008
00:50:10,925 --> 00:50:14,167
(Match striking)

1009
00:50:14,178 --> 00:50:15,884
(Groaning) (Magical twinkling)

1010
00:50:15,888 --> 00:50:18,425
(Whooshing)

1011
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:22,016
(Orchestral music)

1012
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:24,726
(Romantic music)

1013
00:50:26,315 --> 00:50:28,476
(Match striking)

1014
00:50:28,484 --> 00:50:30,645
(Twinkling)

1015
00:50:30,653 --> 00:50:33,520
(Orchestral music)

1016
00:50:34,657 --> 00:50:37,194
I didn't know you liked sousa marches.

1017
00:50:37,201 --> 00:50:38,201
= t don't.

1018
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:39,983
Where there must be something
wrong with your tuner,

1019
00:50:39,995 --> 00:50:41,610
I'll just turn it off.

1020
00:50:41,622 --> 00:50:44,329
Not the only thing that's
going to get turned off tonight.

1021
00:50:44,333 --> 00:50:46,073
(Whistling)

1022
00:50:46,085 --> 00:50:47,825
Well dinner will be ready in 10 minutes.

1023
00:50:47,836 --> 00:50:48,871
= excellent.

1024
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:50,790
That gives us just
enough time for a toast.

1025
00:50:50,798 --> 00:50:51,878
I suppose it does,

1026
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:54,544
is there anything special
worth celebrating?

1027
00:50:54,552 --> 00:50:56,884
Well, this is an anniversary of sorts.

1028
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:58,297
It was exactly two
months ago that you came

1029
00:50:58,305 --> 00:50:59,340
to the university.

1030
00:50:59,348 --> 00:51:00,258
Has it been that long?

1031
00:51:00,266 --> 00:51:01,266
Yes it has.

1032
00:51:01,934 --> 00:51:04,300
I'll never forget seeing
you that first day.

1033
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:05,892
You were so beautiful
you could've knocked me

1034
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:07,011
off my feet. (Chair creaking)

1035
00:51:07,022 --> 00:51:08,637
(Thudding)

1036
00:51:08,649 --> 00:51:09,889
Seating for one.

1037
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,015
(Laughing)

1038
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:11,856
(Chuckling)

1039
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:13,350
Elliott are you alright?

1040
00:51:13,362 --> 00:51:14,943
Yes, I'm just fine.

1041
00:51:16,115 --> 00:51:17,355
The chair must've slipped.

1042
00:51:18,367 --> 00:51:22,360
Well, besides champagne is always best

1043
00:51:22,371 --> 00:51:24,202
when opened standing I always say.

1044
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:27,831
Now where was I?

1045
00:51:27,835 --> 00:51:29,496
Oh, yes, that.

1046
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:32,495
Well although we haven't
known each other that long,

1047
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:35,919
I feel a special bond has grown between us

1048
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:40,010
and more importantly, we
respect each other's dignity.

1049
00:51:40,014 --> 00:51:40,844
(Bottle popping)

1050
00:51:40,848 --> 00:51:43,009
(Laughing)

1051
00:51:46,228 --> 00:51:47,968
Elliott, could I get you a towel?

1052
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:50,813
No, I'm hardly even damp.

1053
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:54,058
What a great sport this guy
is, the drinks are on him.

1054
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:54,979
(Laughing)

1055
00:51:54,987 --> 00:51:58,195
Well it looks like we
have at least enough left

1056
00:51:58,198 --> 00:51:59,438
for one glass each.

1057
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:03,237
= should we have some then?

1058
00:52:05,497 --> 00:52:06,497
Absolutely.

1059
00:52:07,708 --> 00:52:09,994
(Twinkling) - Oopsy.

1060
00:52:10,002 --> 00:52:10,832
(Whirling)

1061
00:52:10,836 --> 00:52:14,795
Daisy. (Playful music)

1062
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:16,709
(Champagne pouring)

1063
00:52:16,717 --> 00:52:20,130
(Upbeat music) (Munchie singing)

1064
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:22,503
(Twinkling)

1065
00:52:22,514 --> 00:52:25,256
J happy birthday j

1066
00:52:25,267 --> 00:52:28,225
(clanking)

1067
00:52:28,228 --> 00:52:29,434
Well before we toast,

1068
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:32,596
I have something I'd like to say to you.

1069
00:52:34,026 --> 00:52:35,482
Actually something to ask you.

1070
00:52:37,363 --> 00:52:38,819
Perhaps is the most important thing

1071
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:40,608
I've ever asked anyone in my life.

1072
00:52:42,618 --> 00:52:43,698
And that thing is.

1073
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:46,829
Well that thing is.

1074
00:52:48,957 --> 00:52:49,912
(Screaming)

1075
00:52:49,917 --> 00:52:51,532
(Playful music)

1076
00:52:51,543 --> 00:52:52,543
= Elliott!

1077
00:52:57,841 --> 00:53:00,207
I heard some noises,
is everything alright?

1078
00:53:00,219 --> 00:53:03,211
No, everything is not
alright, you smart Alec punk!

1079
00:53:03,222 --> 00:53:04,302
Everything is all wrong!

1080
00:53:04,306 --> 00:53:05,091
= Elliott!

1081
00:53:05,099 --> 00:53:08,136
Don't let that innocent
little face fool you.

1082
00:53:08,143 --> 00:53:10,509
He's been out to sabotage
this entire evening.

1083
00:53:10,521 --> 00:53:12,307
That's ridiculous,
he's been up in his room

1084
00:53:12,314 --> 00:53:13,224
the whole evening.

1085
00:53:13,232 --> 00:53:14,847
I'm telling you he is responsible

1086
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:16,189
but I don't know how,

1087
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:18,149
but if he were my kid
I'd take him outside.

1088
00:53:18,153 --> 00:53:19,017
= Elliott!

1089
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:20,029
Stop.

1090
00:53:22,574 --> 00:53:23,404
Now Gage.

1091
00:53:23,409 --> 00:53:25,365
Elliott's just a little
off tonight, honey.

1092
00:53:25,369 --> 00:53:27,610
Why don't you go up to your
room and I'll see you later.

1093
00:53:28,539 --> 00:53:31,406
(Sighing)

1094
00:53:31,417 --> 00:53:34,454
(Footsteps thudding)

1095
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:35,576
(Breathing)

1096
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:37,327
I'm sorry Cathy, 1

1097
00:53:37,339 --> 00:53:39,204
I overreacted just a bit.

1098
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:41,377
I should never have yelled at the boy.

1099
00:53:41,385 --> 00:53:43,216
No, that's my department.

1100
00:53:44,805 --> 00:53:47,968
Look Cathy, things seem to
have gotten off on the wrong

1101
00:53:47,975 --> 00:53:49,431
foot.

1102
00:53:49,435 --> 00:53:52,177
So why don't we save your
meal for another time

1103
00:53:52,187 --> 00:53:54,269
and let me take you out for a nice dinner?

1104
00:53:55,858 --> 00:53:59,442
I don't know, Gage has been
acting so strangely lately.

1105
00:53:59,445 --> 00:54:01,401
Ti don't want to leave him alone.

1106
00:54:01,405 --> 00:54:03,817
Children always have these mood swings.

1107
00:54:03,824 --> 00:54:05,155
It's part of growing up.

1108
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:08,783
Besides you deserve at least one night off

1109
00:54:08,787 --> 00:54:09,787
from being a parent.

1110
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:12,867
Well, alright.

1111
00:54:15,461 --> 00:54:17,201
Gage, honey.

1112
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:18,212
Yeah mom?

1113
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:21,330
Elliott and I have
decided to go out to dinner,

1114
00:54:21,341 --> 00:54:22,877
is that okay?

1115
00:54:22,885 --> 00:54:23,920
= sure.

1116
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:25,133
Okay, I'll lock up

1117
00:54:25,137 --> 00:54:27,674
and we'll only be gone a few hours.

1118
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:28,681
I'll get my jacket.

1119
00:54:31,435 --> 00:54:33,471
What could happen in a few hours?

1120
00:54:33,479 --> 00:54:35,845
(Grim music)

1121
00:54:38,317 --> 00:54:39,352
I'm sorry Cathy.

1122
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:40,974
(Chuckling)

1123
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:42,021
[Cathy] Oh thank you.

1124
00:54:42,029 --> 00:54:44,691
[Elliott] I know this
great little Italian place.

1125
00:54:44,698 --> 00:54:45,608
You're gonna love it.

1126
00:54:45,616 --> 00:54:47,322
[Cathy] Wonderful.

1127
00:54:47,326 --> 00:54:50,033
(Engine revving)

1128
00:54:53,248 --> 00:54:55,990
(Sighing)

1129
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:58,333
They're gone, you can come out now.

1130
00:54:59,463 --> 00:55:01,579
C'mon I know you're here.

1131
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:02,375
(Whistling)

1132
00:55:02,382 --> 00:55:04,668
Of course I'm here,
where else should I be?

1133
00:55:08,263 --> 00:55:11,300
So I took care of Mr. gq for you.

1134
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:13,048
Yeah, you got him good alright.

1135
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:14,925
But I'm the one who got the blame.

1136
00:55:14,937 --> 00:55:16,347
Did you see his face?

1137
00:55:16,355 --> 00:55:19,017
She'll never marry that schnook now.

1138
00:55:19,024 --> 00:55:22,232
I guess you're right,
but you just go too far.

1139
00:55:22,236 --> 00:55:24,773
Gage, you should never ask for anything

1140
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:26,816
unless you really want it.

1141
00:55:26,824 --> 00:55:27,824
= t know.

1142
00:55:30,661 --> 00:55:32,401
(Groaning)

1143
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:34,528
I know what you need, a party.

1144
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:36,121
You're down in the dumps right?

1145
00:55:36,124 --> 00:55:37,330
A party!

1146
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:39,996
A party, here, no way.

1147
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:43,370
And Andrea is the first
one to get an invite.

1148
00:55:43,382 --> 00:55:44,918
Forget it.

1149
00:55:44,925 --> 00:55:46,631
I'm going to go upstairs to study.

1150
00:55:46,635 --> 00:55:48,626
You can watch TV if you want.

1151
00:55:48,637 --> 00:55:51,970
I'm going back to the
kitchen, later alligator.

1152
00:55:51,974 --> 00:55:55,341
No parties, do you hear me?

1153
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:57,638
(Chuckling)

1154
00:55:59,147 --> 00:56:00,182
(Footsteps thudding)

1155
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:01,190
= t hear him

1156
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:04,016
but I'm just not listening.

1157
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:05,642
(Chuckling) (Grim music)

1158
00:56:05,654 --> 00:56:07,269
Party time.

1159
00:56:07,281 --> 00:56:08,111
(Dial tone ringing)

1160
00:56:08,115 --> 00:56:10,731
(Phone beeping)

1161
00:56:12,661 --> 00:56:14,697
Hello, is this Andrea Kurtz?

1162
00:56:14,705 --> 00:56:18,744
Hi, this is Gage dobson, you
know the new kid in school?

1163
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:21,412
That's great, I didn't even
think you even noticed me.

1164
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:24,708
Anyway, I want to invite you
to a party over at our house.

1165
00:56:24,715 --> 00:56:27,627
It's at 6934 Madison.

1166
00:56:27,634 --> 00:56:29,499
Sure, you can bring your father.

1167
00:56:29,511 --> 00:56:30,671
Okay bye bye.

1168
00:56:30,679 --> 00:56:33,546
Hello, Saul's catering,
this is Elliott Carlisle.

1169
00:56:33,557 --> 00:56:35,764
Yeah, good to talk to you again.

1170
00:56:35,767 --> 00:56:38,179
Listen Saul, I'm having a party tonight

1171
00:56:38,186 --> 00:56:40,268
over at Cathy dobson's place.

1172
00:56:40,272 --> 00:56:43,059
Could you fix me up with
the works on short notice?

1173
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:45,398
About 5060 people.

1174
00:56:45,402 --> 00:56:47,108
Need my credit card number?

1175
00:56:47,112 --> 00:56:48,352
Good, you have it on file.

1176
00:56:48,363 --> 00:56:51,730
Hey listen Saul, shoot the
works, price is no object!

1177
00:56:51,742 --> 00:56:52,572
(Phone ringing)

1178
00:56:52,576 --> 00:56:53,986
Wonder if this thing is still good.

1179
00:56:55,329 --> 00:56:56,159
[Hugh] Hello?

1180
00:56:56,163 --> 00:56:59,655
Yeah, hello Hugh, this is Jack.

1181
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:00,826
How's it going?

1182
00:57:01,752 --> 00:57:04,368
Look, I'm out promoting my latest picture

1183
00:57:04,379 --> 00:57:06,916
and I want to have a little party.

1184
00:57:06,924 --> 00:57:09,336
You think you could airlift
some girls in for me?

1185
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:11,796
A band too.

1186
00:57:11,803 --> 00:57:13,839
Sure why not.

1187
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:16,179
Thanks pal, I owe you one.

1188
00:57:16,183 --> 00:57:17,969
Let me give you the address.

1189
00:57:19,353 --> 00:57:21,719
(Rock music)

1190
00:57:27,194 --> 00:57:32,154
= munchie.

1191
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:36,779
(People chattering)

1192
00:57:49,341 --> 00:57:50,376
[Man] Yeah!

1193
00:57:51,551 --> 00:57:53,758
(Cheering)

1194
00:58:00,852 --> 00:58:01,852
Yo pal!

1195
00:58:02,729 --> 00:58:03,935
Hey, welcome to the party!

1196
00:58:03,939 --> 00:58:06,772
Alright, what's your pleasure?

1197
00:58:06,775 --> 00:58:08,140
My mother is going to kill me!

1198
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:10,608
Relax pal, she won't be home for hours.

1199
00:58:10,612 --> 00:58:12,068
We'll clean up.
(Doorbell ringing)

1200
00:58:12,072 --> 00:58:13,562
Hey, do me a favor will you?

1201
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:15,529
Answer the door, I'm busy here.

1202
00:58:15,534 --> 00:58:17,525
You know, getting the drinks and all.

1203
00:58:17,536 --> 00:58:19,276
What a party, what a party.

1204
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:21,703
Here you go.

1205
00:58:21,707 --> 00:58:23,197
Ti went to two cocktails and one.

1206
00:58:23,208 --> 00:58:26,245
Gage dobson, what are you doing here?

1207
00:58:26,253 --> 00:58:27,368
= t live here.

1208
00:58:27,379 --> 00:58:28,209
(Scoffing)

1209
00:58:28,213 --> 00:58:30,829
You folks sure know how
to throw a great party.

1210
00:58:30,841 --> 00:58:33,082
You can forget about those
20 extra hours of study hall.

1211
00:58:33,093 --> 00:58:35,004
= and the two demerits.

1212
00:58:35,012 --> 00:58:36,252
Whatever those are.

1213
00:58:36,263 --> 00:58:39,221
(Laughing)

1214
00:58:39,224 --> 00:58:40,054
(Cheering)

1215
00:58:40,058 --> 00:58:42,720
(Sighing)

1216
00:58:42,728 --> 00:58:44,343
(Cheering)

1217
00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:45,594
Hi Gage.

1218
00:58:45,605 --> 00:58:46,811
This is my father.

1219
00:58:46,815 --> 00:58:47,645

1220
00:58:47,649 --> 00:58:49,765
Well hi Gage, how you doing?

1221
00:58:50,819 --> 00:58:52,650
This is something.

1222
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:54,235
I've never been to a party like this.

1223
00:58:54,239 --> 00:58:55,069
(Door slamming)

1224
00:58:55,073 --> 00:58:56,233
J women are like that j

1225
00:58:56,241 --> 00:58:57,606
j women are like that j

1226
00:58:57,617 --> 00:59:00,654
j women are like that j

1227
00:59:00,662 --> 00:59:01,868
= neither have I.

1228
00:59:04,416 --> 00:59:07,704
(Romantic upbeat music)

1229
00:59:12,758 --> 00:59:13,758
So Cathy,

1230
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:15,801
what are you saying?

1231
00:59:17,471 --> 00:59:20,759
Elliott, you and I
are such good friends,

1232
00:59:20,766 --> 00:59:23,052
why don't we just keep
it like that for a while.

1233
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:24,049
I don't think I'm ready

1234
00:59:24,061 --> 00:59:26,928
to make a serious commitment right now.

1235
00:59:26,938 --> 00:59:29,930
Well I don't think you
know what you want Cathy.

1236
00:59:29,941 --> 00:59:32,933
You think I'm in the habit of
proposing marriage everyday?

1237
00:59:32,944 --> 00:59:34,935
No Elliott I didn't say that.

1238
00:59:34,946 --> 00:59:36,607
Look, time is running out, babe.

1239
00:59:37,491 --> 00:59:39,823
I have power and prestige.

1240
00:59:39,826 --> 00:59:41,066
(Chuckling)

1241
00:59:41,078 --> 00:59:43,535
And 30 something divorcees with children

1242
00:59:43,538 --> 00:59:45,950
or a glut on today's market.

1243
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:47,242
(Scoffing)

1244
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:49,741
I think that you said just about enough.

1245
00:59:49,753 --> 00:59:51,334
I'd like you to take me home now.

1246
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:55,414
(Snapping)

1247
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:56,255
(Speaking foreign language)

1248
00:59:56,259 --> 00:59:57,419
I'll get this.

1249
00:59:57,427 --> 00:59:58,792
= nonsense.

1250
00:59:58,804 --> 01:00:00,840
When I take a lady out, I always pay.

1251
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:05,842
(Throat clearing)

1252
01:00:10,315 --> 01:00:11,315
My wallet

1253
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:15,016
I must have left it in my other jacket.

1254
01:00:15,028 --> 01:00:18,612
(Rustling) (Clumsy music)

1255
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:22,233
(Speaking foreign language)

1256
01:00:23,578 --> 01:00:24,567
(Rhythmic rock music)

1257
01:00:24,579 --> 01:00:26,695
[Man] What a great party!

1258
01:00:26,706 --> 01:00:30,449
J I wish my baby wouldn't do the right j

1259
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:33,497
j she keep me still

1260
01:00:33,505 --> 01:00:36,463

01:04:04,466 --> 01:04:06,172
You know maybe you could get a loan

1335
01:04:06,176 --> 01:04:08,087
from the small business administration

1336
01:04:08,094 --> 01:04:09,584

You had the singular honor of cleaning up

this entire mess all by yourself.

1342
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:21,729

Well there's only one type of punishment

01:04:25,195 --> 01:04:27,186
he'll understand, Cathy.

1347
01:04:27,197 --> 01:04:30,530
Gage's problem is that you've
turned him into a momma's boy.

1348
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:32,489
Or something even worse.

1349
01:04:32,494 --> 01:04:35,327
Well, I don't think that's
any of your concern is it?

1350

(Snoring)

1355
01:04:54,182 --> 01:04:56,173
What in the hell is that?

Be most interested to know

= can't we be civilized Dr. Carlisle?

1366
01:05:19,791 --> 01:05:21,122
This is an intelligent being,

1367
01:05:21,126 --> 01:05:23,583
it's not a subject for your inspection.

1368
01:05:23,586 --> 01:05:25,577
[Munchie] I'd listen
to him if I was you doc!

1369
01:05:25,588 --> 01:05:26,498
Be quiet!

1370
01:05:26,506 --> 01:05:28,542
You give whatever it is back to Gage.

1375
01:05:33,304 --> 01:05:34,304

He's my father.

1398
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:34,354
Oh good, that explains everything.

Any calls for me while I was out?

Does somebody know you're with us?

1407
01:06:59,349 --> 01:07:01,260
(Tires screeching)

Where are we going?

1410
01:07:13,488 --> 01:07:15,900
No where in particular.

1411
01:07:15,907 --> 01:07:16,942

Traveling's the best, where you headed?

01:07:37,345 --> 01:07:39,586
The lost city of armenkan,

1421
01:07:39,597 --> 01:07:43,636
it's a civilization that
perished about 3000 years ago.

1422
01:07:43,643 --> 01:07:47,352
Oh yeah, I remember, we

Drop me off at the

1431
01:08:09,877 --> 01:08:12,493

1434
01:08:20,805 --> 01:08:21,920
Who needs a license?

1435
01:08:21,931 --> 01:08:24,092
I invented the automobile,
give it, give it.

1436
01:08:28,354 --> 01:08:29,469

Did we hit something?

1439
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:34,140
No something hit us, it's Elliott.

1440
01:08:34,152 --> 01:08:36,268
That guy's a pain in the bumper!

1441
01:08:36,279 --> 01:08:38,986

1442
01:08:40,199 --> 01:08:41,188

(Crashing)

1444
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:45,242
One more hit like that and
he'll knock us off the road!

1445
01:08:45,246 --> 01:08:46,406
We can't stop now.

1446
01:08:46,414 --> 01:08:48,746
(Screeching)

1447
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:56,542

1448
01:08:56,549 --> 01:08:59,791
(Upbeat majestic music)

1449
01:08:59,802 --> 01:09:01,667
Las Vegas here I come.

1450
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:03,260

(Screaming)

1453
01:09:09,145 --> 01:09:10,555
Hold on to your hats!

1454
01:09:10,563 --> 01:09:13,100
I haven't had this much
fun since Disneyland!

1455
01:09:13,107 --> 01:09:14,107
Yahoo!

1456
01:09:15,193 --> 01:09:16,649
Perhaps I should take the wheel again.

1457
01:09:16,653 --> 01:09:18,439
No, back off, I'm hot.

1458
01:09:18,446 --> 01:09:20,482
Just keep your foot on the accelerator.

1459
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:28,657
(Laughing)

1460
01:09:28,665 --> 01:09:30,201

1463
01:09:35,797 --> 01:09:37,537
Yo, professor, 1
don't suppose this thing

1464
01:09:37,548 --> 01:09:39,038
has got a fifth gear does it?

1465
01:09:39,050 --> 01:09:41,166
I don't know, why
didn't I build an airplane

1466
01:09:41,177 --> 01:09:42,587
that we could fly away!

1467
01:09:42,595 --> 01:09:44,381
Fly away, why didn't you say so?

1468
01:09:44,389 --> 01:09:46,846
Professor, I thought you were
the brains of the outfit.

1469
01:09:46,849 --> 01:09:51,764
(Chuckling) (Electrical buzzing)

1470

1474
01:10:08,996 --> 01:10:09,996
Wow!

1475
01:10:18,881 --> 01:10:19,711
(Car braking)

1476
01:10:19,716 --> 01:10:21,001
Whoa!

1477
01:10:21,008 --> 01:10:24,125

(Thudding)

1480
01:10:37,692 --> 01:10:38,647
You gotta stop them!

1481
01:10:38,651 --> 01:10:39,481
There's this flying Jeep

1482
01:10:39,485 --> 01:10:41,976
and this wonderfully
weird little creature.

1483
01:10:41,988 --> 01:10:42,977
We got a live one this time.

1484
01:10:42,989 --> 01:10:44,900
Would you mind stepping over here sir?

1485
01:10:44,907 --> 01:10:46,488
But they're up there,
you had to have seen them!

1486
01:10:46,492 --> 01:10:48,198
Sure we saw them!

1487
01:10:48,202 --> 01:10:50,693
They were chasing Santa
and they flying reindeer.

1488
01:10:50,705 --> 01:10:51,911
Have you been drinking sir?

1489
01:10:51,914 --> 01:10:53,620
Drinking, the guy smells like a brewery.

1490
01:10:53,624 --> 01:10:56,616
Some little girl sprayed
beer in my face you ninny!

1491
01:10:56,627 --> 01:10:58,834
Was she with the creature
and the flying tank?

1492
01:10:58,838 --> 01:11:01,830
Not a tank, you idiot,
a Jeep, a flying Jeep!

1493
01:11:01,841 --> 01:11:03,627
May we see some sort
of identification, sir?

1494
01:11:03,634 --> 01:11:04,634
= of course.

1495
01:11:05,386 --> 01:11:08,878
(Heavy breathing)

1496
01:11:08,890 --> 01:11:10,346
I lost my wallet.

1497
01:11:10,349 --> 01:11:12,806
I am Dr. Elliott Carlisle, department head

1498
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:15,301

1499
01:11:15,313 --> 01:11:18,180
I'm Mr. Spock, this is captain kirk.

1500
01:11:18,191 --> 01:11:20,807
I think it's time we beamed him up.

1501
01:11:20,818 --> 01:11:22,103
(Clanking)

1502
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:25,444

you, they're right up there.

1511
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:53,176
The only way to fly.

1512
01:11:53,184 --> 01:11:54,845
(Laughing)

1513
01:11:54,852 --> 01:11:55,967
How long can we stay up here?

1514
01:11:55,978 --> 01:11:57,184
Not too long.

1515
01:11:57,188 --> 01:11:58,803
It's a strain on my resources.

1516
01:11:58,815 --> 01:12:00,646
Just enjoy it while we can.

1517
01:12:00,650 --> 01:12:03,983
Excuse me, how are you at landings?

1518
01:12:03,986 --> 01:12:06,602
Professor, I fly as well as I drive.

1519
01:12:07,824 --> 01:12:09,439
Help!

1520
01:12:09,450 --> 01:12:10,735

1524
01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:23,085
Wait, wait a minute, I know that woman.

1525
01:12:23,089 --> 01:12:24,204
Cathy?

1526
01:12:24,215 --> 01:12:25,625
Cathy, tell them who I am!

1527
01:12:28,135 --> 01:12:29,591

1528
01:12:29,595 --> 01:12:31,005
Tell them who I am!

1529
01:12:32,348 --> 01:12:35,886
Officers, I've never seen
this man before in my life.

1530

(Whimsical music)

1531
01:12:38,813 --> 01:12:39,802

1532
01:12:39,814 --> 01:12:41,395

Cathy?

1536
01:12:48,447 --> 01:12:49,653
Was it something I said?

1537
01:12:49,657 --> 01:12:51,147
[Officer] Get in the car sir.

to straighten him out.

1545
01:13:13,055 --> 01:13:15,216
Well don't get any jelly from the donuts

1546
01:13:15,224 --> 01:13:16,930

01:15:08,087 --> 01:15:09,577
[Woman] I'm sorry sir, but the aircraft

1599
01:15:09,588 --> 01:15:11,453
has already begun its
taxi down the runway.

1600
01:15:11,465 --> 01:15:14,047
That's impossible, I'm the
captain, this is my crew,

1601
01:15:14,051 --> 01:15:15,882
